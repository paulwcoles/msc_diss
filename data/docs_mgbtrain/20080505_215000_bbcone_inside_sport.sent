BEEN OVER IF KING KEV'S MEN HAD 
TAKEN THEIR CHANCES BUT THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE WILL GO TO THE 
FINAL DAY OF THE SEASON THE GOALS 
THAT KEPT CHELSEA'S TITLE HOPES 
ALIVE AND THE BEST OF THE ACTION 
HE HAS GOT PALACE INTO THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP PLAY OFFS NEED TO THE 
MOST COMBUSTIBLE MANAGER IN THE 
LEAGUE THE IRREPRESSIBLE NEIL 
WARNOCK MEET THE MOST 
COMBUSTIBLE 
WHEN IT IS A PENALTY COMBUSTIBLE AND THE REFEREE HAS MADE A SCREW UP 
I HAVE TO SAY I DON'T WANT TO 
COMMENT BECAUSE I WILL GET IN 
TROUBLE FOR 
IS THE NEW INDIAN 
PREMIER LEAGUE CHANGE IN THE WORLD 
OF CRICKET AS WE KNOW IT JONATHAN 
AGNEW THINKS SO AS LONG AS THE I. P. L. 
CAN AFFORD TO BANKROLL THE BEST 
PLAYERS THEY WILL KEEP COMING BACK 
THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE HAS SET ME 
UP FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE 
WITH ME TONIGHT NEVER ONE TO GET 
CAUGHT OUT DES KELLY OF THE DAILY 
MAIL AND THE PERFECT ALL ROUNDER 
SPORTS BROADCASTER TONY LIVESEY 
MANCHESTER UNITED WILL HAVE TO WAIT 
ANOTHER WEEK THE ODDS ARE ON THEM 
RETAINING THE TITLE BECAUSE OF 
THEIR GOAL DIFFERENCE BUT AT SAINT 
JAMES' PARK TODAY THE POLICE KEPT 
THE PRESSURE ON THE BLUES OFF THE LINE JOHN TERRY IT CAME OFF THERE WOULD WORK BALLACK ONE TO ZERO THE BIG NAME BIG GAME 
GETS A VERY GOOD GOAL MALOUDA TWO TO ZERO GAME OVER CHELSEA 
WILL TAKE THE PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE 
RACE TO THE LAST DAY NEWCASTLE 
UNITED ZERO CHELSEA TWO IT IS STILL 
LEVEL AT THE TOP WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP WE GAVE A 
GOOD BATTLE NOBODY THOUGHT OF US 
AS A CANDIDATE FOR CHAMPIONS NOW 
WE'RE ON THE SAME POINTS ONLY GOAL 
DIFFERENCE WE WILL KEEP ON 
FIGHTING MAYBE AT THE END OF THE 
YEAR WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN 
THE FIRST GAME THAT WE LOST BECAUSE 
OF THE MISTAKES OF THE REFEREE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MINUTES AWAY FROM A POSSIBLE 
PREMIER LEAGUE AND EUROPEAN 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE DOUBLE AND YET 
PEOPLE STILL QUESTION AVRAM GRANT 
YOUR FUTURE ONES THAT CRAZY TO YOU 
NO I DON'T LISTEN TO PEOPLE L. 
ALWAYS SAY THAT I LIKE THIS GAME OF 
FOOTBALL THERE'S NO PROBLEM FOR ME 
I NEED TO DO MY JOB LIKE 
PROFESSIONAL THE MINUTE THEY DON'T 
WANT ME I ALWAYS SAY JUST SAY TO 
ME IF IT HAPPENS 
WE CANNOT GET 
WHERE THEY ARE L. TRY MY BEST BUT 
I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE AT THIS 
FOOTBALL CLUB WHATEVER THEY ARE 
GOING TO GIVE US TO SPEND CAN HELP 
ME TO GET WHERE THEY ARE THEY ARE 
SO FAR AHEAD OF US THE DIVISION I 
LEFT YEARS AGO I WOULD NEVER HAVE 
SAID THAT BUT THE BIG CLUBS ARE 
GETTING STRONGER AND STRONGER WOW 
EVEN THE PLAYERS WHO DID NOT GET 
CHANGED FOR TODAY WOULD GRACE ANY 
OF THE OTHER TEAMS APART FROM THE 
TOP FOUR AND EVEN THOUGHT MIGHT 
EVEN THE TOP FOUR WOULD LIKE SOME 
OF THEM THERE IS A PREMIERSHIP 
WITHIN THE PREMIER LEAGUE AND WE 
ALL KNOW THAT 
WE CAUGHT UP WITH JONATHAN PEARCE 
AFTER IT WAS ALL OVER A BATTLING 
PERFORMANCE IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
FROM CHELSEA WHAT WAS THE 
PERFORMANCE AGAINST NEWCASTLE 
TODAY 
SUBDUED IN THE FIRST HALF I TODAY FELT THEY WERE SUFFERING THE 
PHYSICAL EFFECTS OF THE TWO FUTURE 
MATCHES AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED 
AND LIVERPOOL NEWCASTLE HAD A VERY 
GOOD FIRST HALF CHANCE CLEARED OFF 
THE LINE BY JOHN TERRY TWO HUGE 
MATCHES IN THE END THEY WERE 
WORTHY WINNERS MICHAEL BALLACK A 
BIG GOAL AGAIN THEY COULD HAVE HAD 
MORE 
MICHAEL BALLACK HAS COME INTO MORE HIS OWN IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS HIS 
BEST PERFORMANCES FOR CHELSEA UNDER 
AVRAM GRANT 
THIS ONE WOULD HAVE 
MEANT A LOT TO HIM HE WAS INJURED 
HERE LAST YEAR IT TOOK HIM SO LONG 
TO GET FITNESS BACK CHELSEA DID 
NOT SEE THE BEST OF HIM LAST SEASON 
I DON'T THINK HE WAS STRONG ENOUGH 
MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY FOR THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE THE LAST THREE 
MONTHS HE HAS BEEN THOUGH 
CHELSEA ARE NOW SEEING THE REAL 
MICHAEL BALLACK HE IS GOING FOR A 
TREBLE AS HE DID WITH BELA THE 
QUEUES AND THE EUROPEAN 
CHAMPIONSHIPS WITH GERMANY WITH 
LEVITT UZUN HE LOST ALL THREE LAST 
TIME 
YOU HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT AVRAM TIME GRANT AS A STOP GAP FIGURE WHO WILL 
BE GONE NEXT SEASON HE STILL HAS A 
CHANCE FOR THE TITLE AND THEY ARE 
GOING TO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 
HE SAYS HE IS NOT BOTHERED WHAT 
PEOPLE LIKE YOU SAY 
HE'S RIGHT NOT 
TO BE BOTHERED BY ME HE IS WAITING 
TO HEAR WHAT ROMAN ABRAMOVICH 
THINKS HE HAS BEEN AT STAMFORD 
BRIDGE SINCE MARCH TWENTY THIRD HAS NOT 
BEEN 
HIS RESULTS HAVE IMPROVED BEEN HIS PERSONALITY HAS NOT CHANGED HE 
IS STILL IN A SIMILAR POSITION IN 
THAT HE WAS APPOINTED TO FILL IN 
AFTER JOSE MOURINHO HE HAS DONE 
VERY WELL IF HE WINS THE CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE HE WILL BE DIFFICULT TO 
DISLODGE I DID NOT THINK HE WOULD 
GET SACKED I THOUGHT HE WOULD 
BECOME PART OF A MANAGEMENT TEAM 
WITH A MORE CHARISMATIC COACH THAT 
MAY HAPPEN 
BALLACK SAYING THAT 
AVRAM GRANT HAS GOT TO EARN 
ACCEPTANCE I THINK HE IS SPEAKING 
FROM A POSITION OF RAW POWER WITH 
AUTOCRATIC OWNERS THE FANS DON'T 
MATTER ANY MORE THE PLAYERS DON'T 
MATTER ANY MORE AND I REALLY DON'T 
THINK THE MEDIA MATTERS THEY HAVE 
NOT BEEN ABLE TO SHIFT GRANT IN 
MANCHESTER THAKSIN SHINAWATRA IS 
GETTING RID OF A MANAGER THAT THE 
PLAYERS THE MEDIA AND THE FANS 
WANT IT IS TAKING OWNERSHIP TO A 
NEW LEVEL 
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU 
AVRAM GRANT'S POSSIBLY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MINUTES 
AWAY FROM A PREMIER LEAGUE AND 
EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE DOUBLE 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE THAT HIS POSITION 
IS BEING QUESTIONED BECAUSE OF HIS 
PERSONALITY HAS CHELSEA'S 
RESURGENCE TO PREMIER LEAGUE AND 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE CHALLENGERS COME 
DOWN TO THE MANAGER OR THE PLAYERS 
THAT IS THE DEBATE ARE THEY HAPPY 
WITH HIM DO THEY WANT TO WIN THE 
HONOURS FOR THEMSELVES CHELSEA OR 
AVRAM GRANT ALL KINDS OF DEBATES 
BEHIND THE SCENES WHILE THERE ARE 
THESE FRACTIOUS INFLUENCES OVER THE 
DRESSING ROOM HIS POSITION WILL BE 
QUESTIONED CHELSEA FANS IF HE 
WINS THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE WILL 
WANT HIM TO STAY BUT YOU ARE RIGHT 
TONY IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT THE 
FANS THINK ANY MORE IT ONLY 
MATTERS WHAT THE AUTOCRATIC OWNER 
THINKS THAT FOR ME IS NOT GOOD 
FOR FOOTBALL AND IT IS NOT GOOD TO 
HEAR SUCH A WONDERFUL OPTIMIST AS 
KEVIN KEEGAN SAY TO ME AFTER THE 
GAME THAT HE DOES NOT THINK 
NEWCASTLE WILL EVER BE IN CHELSEA'S 
POSITION BECAUSE OF THE MONEY 
CHELSEA HAVE SPENT TO KEEP 
THEMSELVES IN THIS POSITION THAT'S 
TERRIBLY SAD FOR THE CHALLENGERS 
WE NEED ROMANCE WE NEED ANYONE TO 
BE ABLE TO COME THROUGH AND 
CHALLENGE THAT IS BEING DRAINED 
OUT OF IT BY TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO 
COME IN WITH TOO MUCH MONEY AND NO 
FEELING FOR THE SPIRIT OF OUR SPORT 
THAT'S RIGHT JONATHAN BUT IF YOU 
ARE TALKING ABOUT A CLUB WHO ARE IN 
A POSITION TO IGNORE THE MEDIA 
CHELSEA ARE THE TEAM WHO HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT BRAND PROMOTION 
TURNING THE WORLD BLUE THEY HAVE 
EMBRACED THE WHOLE MEDIA AGE THEY THEY ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN THE MEDIA 
OPINION IS THAT THEY WANT I I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT BUT YOU CAN 
ONLY DO THIS WHEN THE TEAM IS 
WINNING THE FANS MATTER VERY MUCH 
WHEN YOU'RE LOSING 
BUT YOU HAVE 
THROWN ROCKS AT AVRAM GRANT AND HE 
HAS STOOD THERE IMMOVABLE BECAUSE BECAUSE HE HAS GOT THE RESULTS 
THE MEDIA 
HAVE HAD TO CHANGE THEIR OPINION 
HE HAS GOT THE RESULTS SO FAR BUT 
IF THEY GO AGAINST HIM IN THE FINAL 
TWO MATCHES IF THEY DON'T WIN THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE OR THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE WILL ABRAMOVICH STAY WITH 
HIM BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT BE THE 
GLOBAL BRAND LEADER ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY MANCHESTER UNITED PLAYED IT MORE 
ATTRACTIVE FOOTBALL THIRTEEN TIMES THEY 
HAVE SCORED FOUR GOALS CHELSEA 
CANNOT COMPETE WITH THAT THE FANS 
WOULD LOVE HIM TO STAY IF HE WINS 
SILVERWARE BUT I DON'T THINK THAT 
WILL BE ENOUGH TO SELL SHIRTS IN 
THE FAR EAST UNFORTUNATELY TO 
GREAT DEGREE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THAT IS WHAT 
IT COMES DOWN TO SADLY MEANWHILE MEANWHILE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP CRYSTAL PALACE 
HAVE MADE THE PLAY OFFS A 
TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT FOR THEIR 
MANAGER NEIL WARNOCK AFTER 
RELEGATION FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
LAST SEASON WITH SHEFFIELD UNITED 
HE COMPLAINED BITTERLY THAT SOME OF 
THE BIGGER TEAMS HAD FIELDED 
WEAKENED SIDES IN LARGE MATCHES 
THEN HE IS KNOWN FOR BEING 
OUTSPOKEN HE IS BECOMING A CULT 
FIGURE ON YOU TUBE WHERE SOME OF 
HIS MOST STINGING LANCED WONDERING 
STINGING COMPLAINTS ARE DOING THE 
BUSINESS 
POLICE HEAT MAGAZINE BUSINESS WHO IS HEAT MAGAZINE L. WILL DO 
ANYTHING ME IT'S A WONDER HE HAS 
NOT BOOKED US FOR TIME WASTING AT 
THE END 
DO YOU KNOW CHRISTOPHER 
ECCLESTON YOU LOOK LIKE 
IS HE 
GOOD LOOKING ABSOLUTELY FARCICAL 
IT'S JUST STUPIDITY THERE'S SOME 
MANUFACTURED REFEREES AND SOME WHO 
UNDERSTAND THE GAME 
HOW ARE YOU 
ENJOYING LONDON 
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT 
TO WHAT I THOUGHT L. THOUGHT BELOW 
WATFORD IT WOULD BE THE PITS HE 
WAS VERY POOR ARE TODAY 
IT IS NOT 
AN OBVIOUS MATCH NEIL WARNOCK AND 
CRYSTAL PALACE 
OH DEAR ME IT'S A 
HORRIBLE GROUND YOU CAN'T EVER GET 
IN OR OUT THE DRESSING ROOMS ARE 
HORRIBLE THE FANS ARE ON TOP OF 
YOU MY MIDFIELD PLAYER 
ALMOST RAN 
HIM OVER 
HE KNOWS EVERYONE INSIDE 
OUT BUT COMMON SENSE TREES AND 
EVERYTHING WE HAVE PARAKEETS IN 
OUR BACK GARDEN L. FIND IT AMAZING 
ME SOME OF THE THINGS THAT GO OFF 
WITH REFEREES 
YOU ARE WELL KNOWN 
FOR THOSE OUTBURSTS WHEN YOU COME 
HOME CAN YOU LEAVE IT BEHIND OR 
DO THE KIDS KNOW WHEN DAD IS ANGRY 
I AM NEVER ANGRY SHARON THINKS I 
AM A BIG SOFTIE L. WON'T TELL 
ANYBODY OFF TELL THE KIDS OFF SHE 
SAYS IT ALL THE TIME DON'T HAVE 
THAT IN ME JUST AT FOOTBALL 
NEARLY I DON'T THINK IT IS THE BE 
ALL AND END ALL FOOTBALL L. AM NOT 
GOING TO DIE ON FOOTBALL PITCH 
IS THIS SILLY MID OFF 
JUST SILLY 
IF YOU HAVE GOT GOOD HEALTH AND 
YOUR FAMILY IS GOOD IT IS FAR MORE 
IMPORTANT THAN FOOTBALL L. SAID TO 
SIMON IF I GOT THE JOB AND YOU 
EXPECT ME TO BE IN AT EIGHT O'CLOCK 
AND LEAVE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT 
YOU HAVE GOT THE WRONG ONE BUT IT 
IS HOW YOU DO YOUR JOB L. HAVE A 
WAY OF DOING THE JOB L. THINK WE 
WILL CALL IT A DAY 
I IMAGINE THERE 
WERE MOMENTS AT THE END OF LAST 
SEASON WHEN YOU DID NOT ENVISAGE 
YOU COULD BE THIS HAPPY AS YOU 
APPEAR TO BE IN FOOTBALL AND LIFE 
IN GENERAL FOR A LONG TIME 
I FELT 
I HAD HAD SOMETHING TAKEN AWAY FROM 
ME THAT I DID NOT DESERVE L. WORKED 
FOR SEVEN YEARS TO GET SHEFFIELD 
UNITED IN THE TOP FLIGHT TO SEE 
THE FARCE OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
YOU KNOW WITH TEVEZ WAS AN 
ABSOLUTE JOKE IT WOULD NOT HAVE 
HAPPENED WITH ANYBODY ELSE AND 
EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY KNOWS THAT 
TO HAVE THAT AGAINST YOU AND TO 
HAVE THE WEAKENED TEAMS THAT WERE 
PLAYED BUT I AM FACED WITH THAT 
I HAVE SAID MY WITH RAFA BENITEZ 
AND SIR ALEX L. WAS MORE ANNOYED 
WITH RAFA BENITEZ I HAVE SAID MY 
POINT IT HAD TO BE SAID AT THE 
TIME TO GET IT OUT OF MY SYSTEM IT 
WAS MY LIFE AT STAKE IT WAS NOT 
JUST MY TEAM GETTING RELEGATED IT 
WAS MY WHOLE LIFE L. PROBABLY LOST 
MILLIONS BY NOT STAYING IN THE 
LEAGUE AND I LOST MY JOB AS WELL 
NOBODY IS REALLY BOTHERED ABOUT 
SHEFFIELD UNITED OR NEIL WARNOCK 
WHEN THEY ARE RELEGATED EVERYONE 
IS BOTHERED ABOUT THEMSELVES THAT 
IS HOW LIFE IS PEOPLE WHO DISLIKE 
ME I AM NOT BOTHERED IF I AM 
HONEST I LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE AND 
THERE ARE A LOT MORE PEOPLE THAT 
LIKE ME BUT IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS 
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT 
THAT 
PENALTY KICK RED CARD DISCUSS I I AM DISGUSTED L. THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE JOKE YOU DON'T SEE THE BEST THAT I DO 
OFF THE FIELD L. RING ONE OR TWO 
REFEREES NOW I'M THEN AND I ALWAYS 
TRY TO SEE THE REFEREE AFTER THE 
GAME NOT JUST TO COMPLAIN LIKE 
GRAHAM POLL SAID I DID 
HOW IS THAT 
RELATIONSHIP 
WASH MY MOUTH OUT RELATIONSHIP WOULD HE BE WELCOME AROUND HERE FOR 
A CUP OF TEA 
I THINK THE REFEREES 
HAVE IMPROVED SINCE HE RETIRED L. 
THINK HE WAS A LEGEND IN HIS OWN 
MIND 
THERE IS A LOT OF BARING FROM MIND THE SHEFFIELD UNITED SUPPORTERS 
FROM THAT END NEIL WARNOCK IS 
PUTTING HIS HAND TO HIS EAR 
GRAHAM'S INFLUENCE WAS WRONG THE 
WAY HE WAS HE HAD TO BE YOU 
KNOW EVERYONE HAD TO COME TO SEE 
GRAHAM MY DAD WAS REFEREE AND 
SAID HE HAD GOOD GAME WHEN NO ONE SAID ANYTHING TO HIM I DO SIGN 
WHAT I BELIEVE THAT IT COST ME 
MONEY IT COST ME TWO THOUSAND LAST WEEK 
AFTER THE BRISTOL CITY AGAIN IT IT HAS MADE YOU AN INTERNET CULT 
FIGURE THOUGH YOU ARE ALL OVER 
YOUTUBE DO YOU EVER LOOKED TO SEE 
YOURSELF 
THE F. A. COMMITTEE SAID YOURSELF THEY WOULD LIKE ME TO SAY THAT WHEN 
THERE IS A CERTAIN PENALTY AND THE 
REFEREE HAS MADE A COCK UP I DON'T 
WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE IT 
WILL GET ME IN TROUBLE 
IF THAT IS 
GOOD BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW WHAT YOU 
REALLY MEAN CORRECT 
OVER THE CORRECT COURSE OF YOUR CAREER YOU HAVE HAD 
OFFERS THAT YOU HAVE TURNED DOWN 
MOST NOTABLY CHELSEA AND 
PORTSMOUTH DO YOU NEVER LOOK BACK 
AT YOUR DECISIONS AND REGRET IT 
YOU HAVE TO REALLY L. MUST HAVE 
BEEN MAD ON MANY OCCASIONS L. 
WANTED TO TAKE SHEFFIELD UNITED UP 
MY TEAM MY CLUB THE MAJORITY OF 
FANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BEHIND THE 
POINT WE WERE PLAYING SHEFFIELD 
WEDNESDAY THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND 
YOU DON'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT 
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT L. 
HAVE HAD SIX PROMOTIONS AND MANY 
GOOD MOMENTS IN FOOTBALL SOME 
MANAGERS NEVER GET ONE A GOOD 
MOMENT I DO REGRET NEVER MANAGING 
A TOP CLUB AND NEVER MANAGING IN 
THE PREMIERSHIP LONGER A WHISKER 
CHANNON WOULD HAVE HAD THE GUTS TO 
APPOINT ME RATHER THAN HAVING TO 
GET THERE I WISH THE CHAIR MAN 
WITH ALL THE FOREIGN MANAGERS IT 
IS DIFFICULT FOR AN ENGLISH MANAGER 
THE THING ABOUT THE PREMIERSHIP IS 
WHAT YOU CAN'T GET AT THE BOTTOM 
END IS THE QUALITY WHEN YOU GET 
HIGHER UP YOU HAVE TO HAVE QUALITY 
IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE THAT IS WHY 
I AM ENVIOUS L. LOVE TO WATCH 
ARSENAL ARSENE WENGER I DON'T 
GIVE A DAMN IF HE NEVER WINS 
ANOTHER THING L. THINK HE HAS DONE 
MORE FOR FOOTBALL THAN ANYONE ELSE 
IN THIS COUNTRY 
DONALD IS RUINING 
THE SET 
OFF YOUGOV 
GALLOWAY SO 
ARSENE WENGER OF THE TOP FLIGHT 
MANAGERS OFF YOU GO HE IS THE 
ONE YOU WOULD LIKE TO EMULATE THE 
MOST 
ARE A WISH I COULD GIVE HIM MOST THE MONEY TO BUY AN ENGLISH CENTRE 
HALF BECAUSE THEY WOULD WIN 
EVERYTHING SHEFFIELD UNITED WE 
PLAY THEM IN THE LAST DAY OF 
SEPTEMBER PHIL JAGIELKA IN GOAL A 
GOOD SIDE ARSENAL WE BEAT THEM ONE 
ZERO ONE TO ZERO IT DOESN'T GET BETTER 
THAN THAT PITTING YOUR WITS 
AGAINST THE BATS AND GETTING A 
RESULT IS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING 
THE BEST 
DID YOU SPEAK TO HIM 
AFTERWARDS 
HE DOES NOT TALK WHEN AFTERWARDS HE LOSES 
BEING SECOND FROM BOTTOM 
WHEN YOU ARRIVE YOU COULD BE 
PLAYING PREMIERSHIP FOOTBALL NEXT 
SEASON THAT IS AMAZING 
IT IS THE THE YEAR YOU HAVE HAD TO TURN THINGS 
AROUND 
IT WAS A CHALLENGE AS WELL AROUND I WANTED TO SHOW A CERTAIN PEOPLE 
IN SHEFFIELD WHAT SORT OF A MANAGER 
I WAS HOW ARE YOU 
TODAY'S TODAY 
THEY WERE SECOND OR THIRD FROM THE 
BOTTOM WHICH OTHER PEOPLE IN THE 
GAME THOUGHT I WAS AN IDIOT FOR 
COMING DOWN L. DIDN'T THINK WE HAD 
ANY CHANCE OF AVOIDING BREAK 
RELEGATION IN THAT EARLY PERIOD WE 
WERE SECOND FROM BOTTOM IN NOVEMBER 
WE JUST PUT THE KIDS IN A IT HAS 
JUST BEEN AN ENJOYABLE MOMENT FOR 
ME IF YOU GIVE LADS LIKE THAT 
LITTLE BIT OF BELIEFS KNOW THAT 
WE HAVE GOT NUMBER OF YOUNGSTERS 
THAT WILL FLOURISH IN THE 
PREMIERSHIP IT WILL BE ANOTHER 
GREAT CHALLENGE HAVE NEW LEASE 
OF LIFE I HAVE GOT GROUP OF 
YOUNG KIDS COMING THROUGH GROUP 
OF OLD GUYS THAT NOBODY WANTED 
MISFITS WE ARE ALL TOGETHER AND IT 
IS GREAT TO GOING TO WORK CRYSTAL CRYSTAL PALACE IT IN THE PLAY OFFS 
I JUST WANTED THE PLAYERS TO COME 
BACK OUT 
IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF MY GREATEST 
ACHIEVEMENTS TO GET THIS CLUB INTO 
THE PLAY OFFS FROM WHERE WE WERE 
WHEN YOU FINISH IN THE TOP SIX YOU 
HAVE GOT DECENT SIDE WE HAVE 
COME FROM NOWHERE AND NOW EXPECT US 
TO DO ANYTHING THAT TAKES THE 
PRESSURE OFF THE LADS THEY CAN 
ENJOY IT IF WE DON'T WIN THE GAME 
WE HAVE HAD GREAT SEASON WELL WELL DONE TO NEIL WARNOCK AND TO CRYSTAL 
PALACE FOR THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS SO 
FAR I WILL NOT MENTION BURNLEY 
WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT HIM AS A 
PERSON I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD 
ARGUE THAT HE WOULD BE A WELCOME 
ADDITION TO POST MATCH INTERVIEWS 
NEXT SEASON 
BY RIGHTS I SHOULD 
NOT LIKE HIM A LOT OF SUPPORTERS 
PLAYERS AND MANAGERS DO NOT LIKE 
HIM BUT THE IRONY IS LOOK AT HIS 
PROMOTIONS NO TEN THIS SEASON HE 
DIDN'T WIN THE FIRST SIX GAMES BUT 
HE STILL GOT INTO THE PLAY OFFS I 
AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE HIM 
MANAGING MY TEAM 
HE HAS GOT 
INCREDIBLE PASSION FOR THE GAME IN IN ANY DEALINGS I HAVE HAD WITH HIM 
THE MEDIA DO LIKE HIM HE IS VERY 
AFFABLE AND QUOTABLE AND HE ADDS TO 
THE GENERAL MERRIMENT OF THE 
PREMIERSHIP HOWEVER THERE IS ONE 
FLAW IN HIS MAKE UP AND THAT IS THE 
CRITICISM OF REFEREES HE IS NOT 
ALONE IN THIS BIG NAMES LIKE 
RAFAEL BENITEZ AND FERGUSON BUT IT 
IS A SCAPEGOAT WE HAD ABOUT AVRAM 
GRANT TALKING ABOUT A DECISION WAY 
BACK AT THE START OF HIS REIGN 
COSTING THEM THE TITLE IT 
UNDERMINES THE CULTURE AND THE GAME 
OF THE OFFICIATING IT CAUSES 
PROBLEMS ALL THE WAY DOWN THE 
PYRAMID AND IF NEIL COULD GET SOME 
CONTROL OVER THAT IT WOULD BENEFIT 
HIM ALSO HE IS TALKING ABOUT HIS 
DAD BEING A REFEREE WOULD HE LIKE 
IT IF SOMEONE WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS 
DAD IN THE SAME TERMS L. DO NOT 
THINK SO 
HE IS VERY GOOD AT 
KEEPING TEAMS UP AND GETTING THEM 
UP TO THE NEXT DIVISION SIX TIMES 
HE HAS WON PROMOTION WHO WOULD BET 
AGAINST HIM AND MOMENTUM IS WITH 
THEM AS THEY HEAD INTO THIS PLAY 
OFF SERIES 
OTHER MANAGERS HAVE 
THEIR REPUTATION BUT HE DEMANDS 
THAT NO BIG TEAM HAS COME FOR HIM 
HE HAS NEVER MANAGED A BIG TEAM 
SADLY FOR HIM THE FACT THAT SVEN 
GORAN ERIKSSON IS NOT BIG ENOUGH 
FOR MANCHESTER CITY MEANS THAT HE 
WOULD NOT BE CHOSEN 
WHAT ARE THE 
QUALITIES HE IS LACKING 
THERE IS A 
FASHION ELEMENT A PERCEPTION THAT 
HE DOES NOT HAVE THE SOPHISTICATION 
TO GET A TEAM OUT OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP BUT HE IS NOT VERSED 
IN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL HE HAS NOT 
HAD A CHANCE HE MADE THAT POINT 
IT HAS BEEN AN EXCITING 
CHAMPIONSHIP A LOT OF SHAKING YOUR 
HEAD 
EXCITING BUT FOR WHAT HEAD REASON IS IT AS GOOD IN QUALITY L. 
AM NOT SO SURE L. HAVE SEEN A FEW 
GAMES FOR BRISTOL CITY AND IT HAS 
NOT BEEN GREAT 
IT IS AN KNUD POINT 
IT IS NOT WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO 
MOVE INTO THE PREMIERSHIP THE 
STANDARD HAS BEEN LOWER THAN IN THE 
PAST 
AND MOOD OH FOUR STOP HAS IT PAST BEEN EXCITING IT HAS EVERY YEAR 
YESTERDAY THERE WERE TWO GAMES 
WITH NOTHING RIDING ON THEM WHICH 
IS FABULOUS ON THE LAST DAY OF THE 
SEASON 
BRISTOL CITY ARE IN THE SEASON PLAY OFFS THEIR GOAL DIFFERENCE IS 
PLUS ONE 
DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE 
CRYSTAL PALACE IN THE PREMIERSHIP 
THEY WILL BE TOUGH TO STOP THEY THEY HAVE GOT A GOOD CHANCE COULD COULD CRICKET BECOME AS POPULAR AS 
FOOTBALL COULD TOP CRICKETERS EARN 
THE SAME MONEY AS PREMIER LEAGUE 
FOOTBALLERS IT IS STARTING TO 
HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE INDIAN 
PREMIER LEAGUE THE HEADY MIX OF 
MONEY POWER AND RAZZMATAZZ IS SET 
TO CHANGE CRICKET FOREVER AS 
JONATHAN AGNEW FOUND OUT ENGLISH 
CRICKETERS WHO ARE NOT ALLOWED TO 
TAKE PART WANT A PIECE OF THE 
ACTION 
SHANE WARNE HAS BEEN BOUGHT FOR 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS 
NOW IT IS THE RICHEST FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS CRICKET TOURNAMENT IN THE WORLD AND 
THIS AFTERNOON IT BEGAN IN STYLE 
MR. ADAM GILCHRIST HAS BEEN BOUGHT 
FOR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS 
CAN CRICKET DELIVER 
THE WOW FACTOR AND THE PROFIT 
INDIAN CRICKET IS IMPORTING 
CHEERLEADERS AND SOME OF THE BEST 
CRICKETERS AROUND THE WORLD BUT 
THERE IS CONCERN THAT IT WILL 
CHANGE THE WAY THAT CRICKET HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN RUN 
IT WAS AS LONG AGO 
AS SEVENTH ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THAT BRITISH SAILORS 
INTRODUCED CRICKET INDIA IT IS 
FAIR TO SAY THAT IT IS THE ONE TRUE 
UNIFYING FORCE ON THESE DUSTY 
STREETS THAT NOW HOUSE MORE THAN ONE 
BILLION PEOPLE FIVE YEARS AGO 
THEY DID IT AGAIN INTRODUCING A 
SHORTENED VERSION OF THE GAME 
CALLED T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY DESIGNED TO 
BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO COUNTY 
CRICKET NOW THE INDIANS HAVE THEIR 
OWN HANDS ON T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY AND WHAT THEY 
ARE DOING WITH IT THREATENS TO 
SPLIT WORLD CRICKET 
T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY IS 
WHAT WILL KEEP TEST CRICKET ALIVE 
OH MY WORD THAT IS HUMAN THIS FIFTY FIFTY OVER CRICKET STARTED OFF IN A 
POSITION WHERE IT WAS EXCITING AND 
FRESH WE ARE GETTING TWO HUNDRED THIRTY RUNS IN 
FIFTY OVERS 
ONE HUNDRED OFF FORTY TWO DELIVERIES 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC STUFF MAYBE MAYBE IT IS THE FUTURE 
IT IS VERY 
POPULAR LOTS OF PEOPLE COME TO 
WATCH IT 
THE PROOF IS IN THE 
PUDDING THAT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE IT 
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE GOT OUR HEADS 
AROUND HOW SIGNIFICANT AN IMPACT 
THIS HAS ON OUR SPORT 
T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY CAN 
BECOME THE TEAM SPORT OF THE WORLD 
INDIA'S T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY REVOLUTION STARTED 
MUCH THE SAME WAY AS ONE DAY 
CRICKET TOOK OFF OVER YEARS AGO 
KERRY PACKER FRUSTRATED AT BEING 
UNABLE TO SECURE AUSTRALIAN CRICKET 
RIDES IT TOOK DENIGRATE AND SOME 
OF THE WORLD'S FINEST PLAYERS TO 
CREATE HIS OWN COMPETITION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
A TELEVISION COMPANY WAS THE 
FRUSTRATED PARTY SO THEY 
ESTABLISHED THE UNOFFICIALLY INDIAN 
CRICKET LEAGUE TOP STARS AND EVEN 
SOME ENGLAND PLAYERS JOINED BUT IT 
WAS GIVEN REBEL STATUS AND I. C. L. 
PLAYERS WERE BANNED FROM FURTHER 
INTERNATIONAL ACTION THE INDIAN 
AUTHORITIES WENT ONE STEP FURTHER 
AND SET UP THEIR OWN OFFICIAL 
LEAGUE CRUCIALLY THIS TIME THEY 
HAD THE BATTING THE SUPPORT OF 
THE OTHER COUNTRIES AND THE GAME'S 
INTERNATIONAL WATCHDOG THE CRICKET 
COUNCIL EIGHT FRANCHISES WERE 
CREATED PLAYERS WERE AUCTIONED OFF 
FOR HUGE SUMS MILLIONAIRES WERE 
CREATED OVERNIGHT AND THE I. P. L. WAS 
BORN 
THE RAMIFICATIONS BUT IT IS BORN ALL GOOD WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS 
CONSUMERS ADDICTED TO THE GAME OF 
T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY CRICKET T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY WANTS TO 
WATCH THREE HOURS LIKE FOOTBALL 
IN NINETY MINUTES THESE DAYS PEOPLE 
ARE MORE BUSY THAN EVER 
IF I CAN 
GET A LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM ABOUT 
PLAYING THE GAME I JUST CAN'T SEE 
THERE IS ONE DOWNSIDE TO IT 
SO YOU 
THINK THAT THE FIFTY OVERS GAME IS 
PROBABLY ON THE WAY OUT DEFINITELY DEFINITELY IT HAS BEEN THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS AND 
IT NEEDS CHANGE IT WILL GO 
T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY 
I THINK IF PEOPLE ARE T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY TIRED OF THIS OR ARE NOT VERY HAPPY 
ABOUT THE KIND OF CRICKET OR 
ENTERTAINMENT IT WILL SHOW GONE GONE ARE THE DAYS WHEN WARM PINTS OF 
BEER AND SMOKING A PIPE FOR THE 
BETTER PART OF TEN HOURS I DON'T 
THINK PEOPLE HAVE THE TIME L. THINK 
HIS ADDRESSES THOSE ISSUES 
EVEN ON 
THIS GROUND THE SAME QUESTION HAS 
BEEN PUT TO ANY TIME AFTER TIME 
WHERE ARE THE ENGLISH MEN IT IS A 
FACT UNTIL DIMITRI MASCARENHAS 
ARRIVES NOT A SINGLE ENGLISHMAN IS 
TAKING PLACE IN THIS TOURNAMENT 
THEY WILL BE WATCHING BACK AT HOME 
ON THE TELEVISION GREEN WITH ENVY 
AND READY FOR A FIGHT WITH THE 
BOARD 
THERE ARE NO BANS NO ONE IS BOARD PREVENTED FROM BEING RECRUITED THE 
I. P. L. CHOSE NOT TO RECRUIT BACK IN 
OCTOBER 
THEY ARE ALREADY TALKING OCTOBER ABOUT MOVING THE I. P. L. SO MORE 
ENGLISH PLAYERS CAN DO IT THEY 
WANT TO GET EVERYONE INVOLVED SO 
IT CAN OBVIOUSLY GET BIGGER WITH 
THE MONEY INVOLVED IT WILL 
DEFINITELY GET BIGGER 
WHERE ARE 
THE ENGLISHMAN 
COME ON WE NEED YOU PLAY FOR US 
EVERYONE WANTS TO BE INVOLVED IN 
SOMETHING SO EXCITING YOU DON'T 
WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND THE E. C. B. 
COURT IN T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY CRICKET IT'S 
SOMETHING WE DEFINITELY WANT TO GET 
A HOLD OF PORTEND 
SURELY ALL 
KEVIN PIETERSEN HAS TO DO IS OPT 
OUT OF A CENTRAL CONTRACT HE WILL 
GET HIS PLACE BACK 
IT'S A RISK 
DECISION FOR HIM 
I AM LOOKING FOR 
A CHENNAI SUPER KINGS SHIRT HOW 
ARE YOU ARE YOU WATCHING THE 
CRICKET TONIGHT 
WELL WE HAVE RISKED LIFE AND LIMB 
TO FIND ONE OF THESE T. SHIRTS 
PLENTY OF YELLOW T. SHIRTS AROUND 
BUT NOTHING WITH CHENNAI SUPER 
KINGS THE SEARCH GOES ON SURELY 
THE IPL'S GREATEST CHALLENGE IS 
CHANGING THE MINDSET OF INDIA'S 
CRICKET CRAZY POPULATION WHO 
FOLLOW THE NATIONAL TEAM WITH A 
RARE EXCITEMENT YET SHOW LITTLE OR 
NO INTEREST FOR DOMESTIC AND 
REGIONAL CRICKET BUT THAT IS WHAT 
THE I. P. L. IS FOUNDED UPON IMAGINE A 
CHENNAI CRICKET SUPPORTER 
CELEBRATING JACOB ORAM CLEAN 
BOWLING BY SACHIN TENDULKAR WORSE 
STILL MATTHEW HAYDEN SMASHING 
HARBHAJAN SINGH FOR SIX I'M NOT SO 
SURE 
THAT'S BIG IT'S MASSIVE SURE MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI IS REVERED 
EVERYWHERE I WAS EXPECTING WHEN HE 
WENT OUT TO BAT THERE WOULD BE A 
MASSIVE CHEER IT WAS A LOT LESS 
THAN I EXPECTED THOUGHT O. K. 
MAYBE THEY LIKE HIM AND THEY WANT 
HIM TO DO WELL BUT MAYBE NOT TODAY 
BECAUSE HE IS IN THE OPPOSITION IT IT MIGHT TEST THE FANS ALLEGIANCE TO 
HAVE IT LIKE THIS PEOPLE IN 
CHENNAI MATTHEW HAYDEN HARBHAJAN 
WHO DOES A SO WHO DO THEY 
SUPPORT ME 
IF TENDULKAR MAKES SUPPORT ME ZERO IS IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO 
CELEBRATE 
HE IS IN THE OPPOSITION CELEBRATE TEAM IF IT WAS FOR INDIA WE WILL 
BE SAD FOR THE OPPOSITION WE WILL 
BE HAPPY I ALMOST BELIEVE YOU 
ULTIMATELY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT 
THE ADMINISTRATORS THE PLAYERS OR 
I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT IT IS THE 
CHARACTERS WHO WILL DECIDE THE 
FUTURE OR OTHERWISE OF THE I. P. L. 
NICE WORK MATE L. AM AFRAID HE IS NOT PLAYING TONIGHT 
THIS MATCH PRETTY MUCH TOLD THE 
STORY OF THE I. P. L. SO FAR MAHENDRA 
SINGH DHONI'S CHENNAI SUPER KINGS 
ASSERTING THEIR DOMINANCE THE MOST 
EXPENSIVE FRANCHISE THE MUMBAI 
INDIANS HAVE FOUND IT TOUGH GOING 
THE CHENNAI SUPER KINGS WILL MISS 
MIKE HUSSEY MATTHEW HAYDEN AND 
JACOB ORAM WHO HAVE LEFT FOR TEST 
DUTY AMID RUMOURS THAT SOME 
PLAYERS HAVE NOT YET BEEN PAID 
MUMBAI WILL BE HOPING THAT SACHIN 
CAN ADD SOME SPARKLE AS HARBHAJAN 
SINGH SAYS AND ELEVEN MATCH BAN FOR 
SLAPPING SREE SANTH IN A PREVIOUS 
GAME AN ELEVEN MATCH BAN T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY 
IS A HIT AT THE WORLD OVER THEY 
LOVE MATTHEW HAYDEN'S HALF CENTURY 
BY THE WAY THE ONLY DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THIS MATCH AND ANY OTHER 
T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY MATCH THAT I HAVE SEEN IS 
THE MONEY AS LONG AS THE I. P. L. CAN 
AFFORD TO BANKROLL THE BEST PLAYERS 
IN THE WORLD THEY WILL KEEP COMING 
BACK 
THE FINANCIAL FIDE SIDE OF BACK THINGS IS FANTASTIC IT HAS SET ME 
UP FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE BUT WE 
ARE HERE TO PERFORM AS CRICKETERS 
IT'S SO EXCITING AT THE MOMENT THAT 
WE JUST THRILLED TO BE A PART 
OF IT 
YOU'RE NOT SEEING A DOLLAR 
BILL ROLLING DOWN WHEN YOU ARE AT 
THE CREASE YOU'RE SEEING THE SAME 
CRICKET BALL THAT HAS BEEN AROUND 
SINCE PRETTY MUCH THE INVENTION OF 
THE GAME 
IT WAS ACTUALLY 
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR A WHILE IT WAS 
MORE THAN MUMBLING SOME PEOPLE 
WERE CRITICISING US HEAVILY FOR OUR 
LACK OF LOYALTY AND DESIRE TO PLAY 
FOR OUR COUNTRY WHICH HEARD QUITE 
A LOT 
I AM SURE THERE WILL BE GUYS 
COMING TO THEIR END OF THEIR CAREER 
HURT QUITE A LOT 
THEY HAVE DONE 
EVERYTHING AND THEY WILL BE TESTED 
IN TIME 
INEVITABLY WE ARE HEARING LOTS OF 
POSITIVE NOISES FROM THE PLAYERS 
AND THE ADMINISTRATORS BUT IN 
TRUTH THERE ARE ISSUES THAT THE 
I. P. L. WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS AS MANY 
AS TWENTY THOUSAND OUT OF POSSIBLE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
TICKETS HAVE BEEN GIVEN AWAY IN 
DELHI TO FILL THE GROUND NEWS 
AGENCIES HAVE BOYCOTTED THE 
TOURNAMENT AFTER A ROW ABOUT THE 
DISTRIBUTION OF PHOTOGRAPHS INDIAN 
JOURNALISTS HAVE SAID THEY DARE NOT 
WRITE ANYTHING CRITICAL ABOUT THE 
I. P. L. FOR FEAR OF HAVING THEIR 
ACCREDITATION TAKEN AWAY MANY 
PEOPLE HERE FEEL THAT THE CRICKET 
IS MERELY SIDESHOW TO THE 
BOLLYWOOD ACTORS AND THE DANCING 
GIRLS THE TOURNAMENT LASTS FOR 
EVER FOUR MORE DAYS OF CRICKET 
HERE EVEN THE INTERMINABLE MORE 
THAN THE INTERMINABLE WORLD CUP OF 
CRICKET LAST YEAR THE COMMENTARY 
LACKS ANY OBJECTIVITY IT IS THE 
WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN BACK HERE 
IN A DRIZZLY ENGLAND A MORE 
PATIENT APPROACH THEY ARE HOPING 
THAT THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OFFERED BY THE 
TEXAN BILLIONAIRE SIR ALAN PAST 
SIR ALAN STANFORD WILL KEEP KEVIN 
PIETERSEN AND COMPANY AWAY FROM THE 
LOW OF THE I. P. L. FOR THE NEXT FIVE 
YEARS IT IS ENGLAND AGAINST 
STANFORD WEST INDIES SIDE FOR TWENTY DOLLARS 
MILLION DISCUSSIONS FOR SIMILAR 
ANNUAL TOURNAMENT EVERY YEAR AT 
LORD'S 
IF IT COMES TO FRUITION IT LORD'S WILL BE THE SINGLE BIGGEST PAY DAY 
IN THE HISTORY OF TEAM SPORTS FOR 
ONE GAME IT IS WINNER TAKE ALL 
EACH PLAYER WOULD BE GUARANTEED ONE DOLLAR 
MILLION AT LEAST THAT WOULD BE A 
MILLIONAIRE OVERNIGHT IN A MATTER 
OF THREE HOURS 
I THINK IT'S GOOD 
FOR THE GUYS LET'S HAVE A REASON 
TO WIN LET'S BE FOCUSED AND 
DETERMINED THE ONLY PEOPLE THEY 
CAN COMPLAIN ABOUT THE NOT EARNING 
MONEY IS THEMSELVES 
HE HAS ROLLED 
OUT THE PROSPECT OF CITY BASED 
FRANCHISES FORMING PART OF AN 
ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE RULED OUT 
BUT WITH STAMFORD WAITING IN THE 
WINGS TWO THOUSAND TEN IS WHEN WE CAN'T EXPECT 
DOMESTIC T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY TO UNDERGO A BIT 
OF A REVAMP 
THE ENGLISH HAVE TO 
MAKE A DECISION TO TAKE CONTROL 
AND RUN WITH THIS OR OUR FRIENDS 
TO THE EAST WILL TAKE CONTROL AND 
WE WILL BE FOLLOWING THEM 
WE HAVE 
A MODEL THAT WORKS THERE IS AN 
AWFUL LOT OF NONSENSE WRITTEN THAT 
WOULD IMPLY IT DOES NOT WORK IT 
WORKS VERY WELL IT'S VERY POPULAR 
LOTS OF PEOPLE COME AND WATCH THE 
GAMES ARE EXCITING IT IS WHAT THE 
I. P. L. BUILT AN INDIAN MODEL ON TO 
TELL US IT HAS TO BE TORN UP 
TOMORROW IS A SIGN OF PEOPLE WHO 
ARE THE KIND OF BLOKES WHO LOSE 
MONEY PRETTY QUICKLY IN DUFF 
INVESTMENTS 
WE HAVE SPOKEN TO PLAY INVESTMENTS US ADMINISTRATORS AND SUPPORTERS 
WHAT CAN WE CONCLUDE T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY IS 
HERE TO STAY IT'S EXCITING AND 
ENTERTAINING IF RATHER SHALLOW AND 
SHORT LIVED BUT IN MY VIEW IT 
SPELLS THE END OF THE RATHER MORE 
PREDICTABLE FIFTY OVERS FORMAT THE THE GOVERNANCE OF THE GAME IS WAS TO 
REMAIN RESERVED CLEVER TO RESERVED 
IT COULD BECOME THE WORLD RESERVED SPORT REPLACING SOCCER KERRY KERRY PACKER CHANGED THE FACE OF CRICKET 
YOU CAN IMAGINE A SIDEWAYS LOOKS 
THE EYEBROWS IN THE LONG ROOM 
THINKING WHAT'S GOING ON BUT IT 
HAS BEEN A BETTER GAME WILL 
T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY BRING THE SAME KIND OF 
CHANGE WE WILL SEE CONSUMERS WILL 
TELL US 
EXCITING GLAMOUROUS IT 
HAS GOT IT ALL THE PLAYERS AND THE 
MONEY BUT SURELY LONG TERM THIS 
DOES NOT SPELL THE END OF PROPER 
TEST CRICKET 
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE 
KING CANUTE FROM THE E. C. B. SAYING 
THAT NOTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE L. 
THINK IT IS THEY ARE TRYING TO 
KEEP PLAYERS HAPPY IN THIS COUNTRY 
BUT THEY HAVE UNLEASHED A GENIE OUT 
OF THE BOTTLE IF YOU ARE GOING TO 
MAKE PLAYERS MILLIONAIRES WITH IN 
TWENTY OVERS IT IS GOING TO DOMINATE 
CRICKET LIKE NOTHING ELSE THERE IS 
A SEVERE THREAT TO THE COUNTY GAME 
LOTS OF PLAYERS ON THE COUNTY 
CIRCUIT STANDING IN THE FIELD THIS 
SUMMER THINKING I COULD BE EARNING 
A FORTUNE IN INDIA HANG ON AS 
THIS DEVELOPS THINK TEN TWENTY YEARS 
WHAT WILL KIDS WANT TO PLAY THEY 
WILL NOT WANT TO PLAY FIVE DAY TEST 
CRICKET 
THEY WILL IF THEY HAVE CRICKET BEEN ENTHRALLED IN A FABULOUS ASHES 
SERIES 
NO TEST CRICKETER IS WANT SERIES TO BE IS GOING TO WANT TO BE 
DEFINED AS THE GREATEST T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY 
PLAYER IT IS THE PINNACLE OF THE 
GAME BEING THE BEST T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY 
CRICKETER IS LIKE BEING THE BEST 
FIVE A SIDE FOOTBALL 
YOU'RE USING 
AN ANALOGY FOR TODAY NOT TWENTY YEARS 
THE LAST ASHES SERIES WAS NOT VERY 
EXCITING BECAUSE WE GOT THUMPED 
BUT THE NEXT ONE COULD BE THE THE PROBLEM IS AND IT IS NOT WHAT WE 
THINK IT IS WHAT THE SPONSORS 
THINK AND THE PLAYERS THINK YOU 
CAN SEE THE DOLLAR SIGNS ROLLING 
AROUND 
IF THERE WAS MONEY IN TEST AROUND CRICKET THEY COULD SIT SIDE BY 
SIDE 
THE ONE TO WATCH ENGLAND SIDE AGAINST BANGLADESH OR THE WORLD'S 
BEST PLAYERS SLUGGING IT OUT 
IT IS 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FAST FOOD 
SNACK AND SOMETHING BIGGER THE 
TEST GAME WILL SURVIVE AND PROBABLY 
THRIVE BECAUSE OF T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY BEFORE BEFORE THE PAPERS A REMINDER THAT YOU CAN 
SEE THE PARALYMPIC WORLD CUP NEXT 
SUNDAY AT FOUR O'CLOCK P. M. ON B. B. C. TWO THE 
HEADLINES IN THE GUARDIAN CHELSEA
