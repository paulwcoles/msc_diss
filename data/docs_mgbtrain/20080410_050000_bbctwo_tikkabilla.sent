WHEN I'M FLYING IN MY PLANE 
WOO HOO 
NO TREASURE TO BE FOUND THIS TIME 
BUT MAYBE WE'LL SEE SOME BOATS TRAINS OR PLANES 
THROUGH THE WINDOWS 
HOW MANY WINDOWS ONE TWO THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE ROUND WINDOW 
OH IT'S A BUS 
A BUS CAN GET REALLY DIRTY WHEN IT'S DRIVING ON THE ROADS 
DRIVING THROUGH PUDDLES CAN MAKE A BUS ALL MUDDY 
SO DILLON HAS DECIDED HIS BUS SHOULD HAVE A GOOD WASH 
FIRST HE NEEDS TO PUT SOME SOAP INTO A BIG BARREL 
THEN HE ADDS SOME WATER TO MAKE IT REALLY BUBBLY 
DILLON NEEDS AN EXTRA LONG BRUSH TO CLEAN HIS DOUBLE DECKER BUS 
HE HAS TO SCRUB VERY HARD TO GET ALL THE GRIME OFF 
LOOK HOW DIRTY IT IS NEAR THE WHEELS 
DILLON IS GETTING THE SPONGE REALLY SOAPY 
SO THAT HE CAN CLEAN THE WHEELS 
THE WHEELS ARE THE DIRTIEST PART OF THE BUS 
NEXT HE NEEDS TO CLEAN THE HEADLAMPS 
SO HE CAN SEE WHERE HE'S GOING AT NIGHT 
AND THE INDICATORS SO THAT OTHER DRIVERS CAN SEE WHEN HE IS TURNING 
DILLON HAS TO BE ABLE TO SEE CLEARLY THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN 
SO THAT HE CAN DRIVE THE CHILDREN WHO GET ON HIS BUS SAFELY 
HE IS CLEANING THE TOP WINDOW 
SO THE CHILDREN WHO SIT UPSTAIRS GET A GOOD VIEW OF WHERE THEY'RE GOING 
IT'S A LONG WAY UP 
OR A LONG WAY DOWN DEPENDING WHERE YOU ARE LOOKING 
NOW IT'S TIME TO RINSE OFF ALL THE SOAP SUDS 
FIRST THE WHEELS 
IT TAKES A LOT OF WATER TO RINSE OFF A DOUBLE DECKER BUS 
LOOK AT ALL THE DIRT COMING OFF 
THERE A NICE SHINY BUS 
WOW DOESN'T THAT BUS LOOK SPARKLY AND CLEAN 
I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE A GO AT MAKING OUR OWN BUS TODAY 
I'VE GOT A CARDBOARD BOX 
AND SOME RED CARD 
AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO 
IS COVER THE CARDBOARD BOX BECAUSE MY BUS IS GOING TO BE RED 
BUT IF YOU MAKE ONE YOU CAN HAVE ANY COLOUR YOU LIKE 
YELLOW OR GREEN OR BROWN 
BUT THE BUS I TRAVEL ON THE NUMBER EIGHT BUS IS RED 
TO COVER THE ENDS I'VE GOT 
A COUPLE OF PIECES OF RED CARD CUT OUT INTO SQUARE SHAPES 
SO IF WE PUT SOME GLUE ON THOSE 
LOTS OF GLUE I THINK TO MAKE SURE IT STICKS PROPERLY 
AND THEN JUST STICK 
THE ENDS LIKE THAT DO THE SAME ON THE OTHER SIDE 
LOTS OF GLUE 
IT'S GREAT GLUEING THINGS 
LIKE THIS RIGHT 
AND THEN POP THAT ONE ON LIKE THAT THAT LOOKS GOOD 
NOW WHAT'S NEXT DO YOU THINK 
WELL OUR BUS NEEDS WHEELS 
FOR THE WHEELS I'M GOING TO USE 
FOUR COTTON REELS 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
AND TO STICK THEM ON THE BUS 
I'M GOING TO USE SOME STRAWS 
WHAT YOU DO IS THREAD THE WHEELS THESE WILL BE THE FRONT WHEELS 
LIKE THAT ONTO THE STRAW 
POP THEM UNDER THE BUS AND THEN BEND THE STRAW LIKE THAT 
AND THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS STICK THEM DOWN WITH SOME TAPE 
ONE THAT SIDE 
AND ONE THAT SIDE 
I THINK WE'LL PUT AN EXTRA PIECE OF TAPE THERE AS WELL 
TO HOLD THE FRONT DOWN THERE 
THAT SHOULD RIDE ALONG JUST NICE 
THEN WE DO THE SAME ON THE BACK 
A COUPLE OF COTTON REELS ONTO THE STRAW 
BEND THE STRAW AND THEN 
POP THEM ON WITH SOME STICKY TAPE 
IT'S A BIT TRICKY THIS 
SO YOU MIGHT NEED TO GET SOME HELP 
A COUPLE OF BITS ONE THERE 
AND ONE THERE 
HOW'S THAT 
THAT'S GOOD ISN'T IT 
RIGHT WHAT'S NEXT WELL THE BUS NEEDS SOME WINDOWS 
FOR THE WINDOWS I'M GOING TO USE SOME SILVER FOIL 
YOU CAN COUNT WITH ME IF YOU WANT THERE ARE LOTS OF WINDOWS TO GO ON 
THIS IS A BIG ONE SO IT CAN GO AT THE FRONT OF THE BUS 
FOR THE DRIVER TO LOOK OUT OF 
ONE 
THEN WE'LL DO THE OTHER BIG WINDOW FOR THE BACK 
TWO AND NOW WE'LL DO OOPS 
THE SIDE ONES 
THREE 
THESE ARE FOR THE PASSENGERS SO THEY CAN SEE OUT OF THE BUS 
FOUR 
ARE YOU STILL COUNTING 
FIVE 
LOTS OF WINDOWS ON A BUS AREN'T THERE 
SIX 
NOW I'LL TURN IT AROUND THE OTHER SIDE 
IT'S VERY STICKY TOO 
SEVEN 
EIGHT 
TWO MORE 
NINE 
AND THE LAST ONE MAKES 
TEN 
THERE YOU GO THERE 
THAT LOOKS LOVELY DOESN'T IT 
WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED FOR OUR BUS 
WHAT ABOUT SOME LIGHTS AT THE FRONT AND THE BACK 
FOR THE LIGHTS I'M GOING TO USE SOME LITTLE YELLOW AND RED POM POMS 
IF WE JUST STICK THE YELLOW ONES ON AT THE FRONT LIKE THAT 
ONE THERE 
AND THEN ONE THERE 
IF WE TURN IT AROUND 
BECAUSE OUR BUS IS THE SAME COLOUR AS THE BACK LIGHTS 
I'LL USE A COUPLE OF STICKERS AT THE BOTTOM 
SO THE LIGHTS SHINE BRIGHTLY 
POP THOSE ON ONE 
TWO 
THERE HOW'S THAT 
I TRAVEL ON THE NUMBER EIGHT BUS AS I SAID EARLIER 
SO WE SHOULD HAVE A NUMBER EIGHT ON THE BUS SHOULDN'T WE 
USE A COUPLE OF STICKERS 
AND DRAW A COUPLE OF NUMBER EIGHTS ON THERE 
ONE FOR THE FRONT OF THE BUS 
AND ONE FOR THE BACK 
SO THE PASSENGERS KNOW WHICH BUS IS WHICH 
THERE 
AND JUST TO FINISH OFF YOUR BUS WHAT YOU CAN DO IS 
CUT A TINY PIECE OF STRAW OFF LIKE THAT 
AND GET A BIT OF STICKY TAPE 
AND TAPE THAT DOWN TO MAKE A WINDSCREEN WIPER 
JUST IN CASE IT RAINS 
THERE 
ONE NUMBER EIGHT BUS READY FOR SERVICE 
OH THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE CLOCK 
MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE IS JUST ABOUT TO START A JOURNEY OF THEIR OWN 
PERHAPS ON A BUS 
LET'S SEE WHAT TIME IT IS 
TIKKABILLA TOCKABILLA 
TIKKABILLA TOCK 
WHAT'S THE TIME ON THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
WELL 
THE LONG HAND IS POINTING TO THE NUMBER THREE 
SO THAT MEANS IT'S A QUARTER PAST SOMETHING 
AND THE SMALL HAND IS POINTING 
JUST PAST THE NUMBER SIX 
SO THAT MEANS IT'S A QUARTER PAST SIX 
BUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CLOCK

BIRDS LAY THEIR EGGS IN NESTS

THESE BIRDS ARE CALLED SWIFTS AND THEY LIVE NEAR A WATERFALL 
SO WHERE ARE THEIR NESTS

THE SWIFT HAS FLOWN THROUGH THE WATERFALL 
AND THERE'S ITS NEST WITH THE EGGS 
THE EGGS ARE VERY SAFE HERE BUT THEY'RE ALSO A BIT DAMP 
THIS BIRD BUILDS ITS NEST INSIDE ANOTHER NEST 
IT'S A WOODPECKER AND IT HAS PECKED A HOLE IN AN ANTS' NEST 
THE ANTS DON'T LIKE THE WOODPECKER TO START WITH BUT AFTER A WHILE 
THEY ARE GOOD NEIGHBOURS 
THESE WEAVER BIRDS HAVE LOTS OF NEIGHBOURS 
BECAUSE ALL THEIR NESTS ARE BUILT RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER 
AT LEAST IT'S NICE AND COSY 
THESE AMAZING TOWERS BELONG TO A TINY ANIMAL 
THAT LOOKS A BIT LIKE AN ANT 
THESE ARE TERMITES' NESTS 
TERMITES ARE GREAT BUILDERS 
AND THEY CAN BUILD BIG CASTLE LIKE MOUNDS TO LIVE IN 
ALL THE TERMITES LIVE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOUND WHERE IT'S SAFE 
THESE ANIMALS ARE CALLED PRAIRIE DOGS BUT THEY'RE NOT DOGS AT ALL 
THEY'RE MORE LIKE SQUIRRELS BUT THEY LIVE UNDERGROUND IN BURROWS 
FOXES LIVE UNDERGROUND IN BURROWS CALLED DENS 
MOLES BURROW RIGHT UNDER YOUR LAWN

AND FEEL THE COMING OF THE NIGHT 
LET YOUR EYELIDS START TO CLOSE 
GIVE A WRIGGLE OF YOUR NOSE 
THEN DRIFT OFF INTO DEEPEST SLEEP 
THE SWEETEST DEEPEST DREAMIEST SLEEP 
DREAM YOUR BED IS A BEAUTIFUL BOAT 
FEEL IT RISE AND FEEL IT FLOAT 
DREAM IT CROSSES THE WILDEST SEA 
BUT GETS BACK HOME IN TIME FOR TEA 
DREAM YOUR PILLOW IS A CLOUD 
FEEL IT FLOATING OVER A CROWD 
SEE THE FACES FAR BELOW 
FACES OF PEOPLE OF FRIENDS THAT YOU KNOW 
DREAM OF COLOURS OF BALLS OF TOYS 
DREAM OF OTHER GIRLS AND BOYS 
SEE THEM DANCING SEE THEM RUN 
SEE YOURSELF JOINING IN WITH THE FUN 
DREAM OF ANIMALS BIRDS AND BEES 
DREAM OF WIND ROCKED WAVING TREES 
WITH GOLDEN LEAVES THAT START TO FALL 
UNTIL THE MORNING COMES TO CALL 
THEN AS YOU WAKE UP IN YOUR BED 
THOSE LAZY DREAMS REST IN YOUR HEAD 
AS YOU RISE READY TO PLAY 
THOSE DREAMS ALL SEEM TO FLOAT AWAY 
BUT NEVER WORRY NEVER FRET
