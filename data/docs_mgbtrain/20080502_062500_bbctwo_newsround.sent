BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR FIRST 
EUROPEAN FINAL IN THIRTY SIX YEARS LAST 
NIGHT AFTER THEIR UEFA CUP SEMI 
FINAL AGAINST FIORENTINA WENT TO 
PENALTIES RANGERS' GOAL LEAD NEIL 
ALEXANDER MADE AL CRUCIAL SAVE AND 
THE VICTORY WAS SAILED SAVED WHEN 
NACHO NOVO BURIED HIS KICK THAT 
GAVE RANGERS A FOUR TO TWO WIN NEXT TO 
THE THINGS YOU WORRY ABOUT YOU ARE 
PROBABLY ALWAYS BEEN TOLD THAT ITS 
IMPORTANT TO WORK HARD AND SCHOOL 
AND DO YOUR BEST BUT SHOULD YOU BE 
WORRIED IF YOU ARE NOT COMING TOP 
OF THE CLASS SITTING TESTS AND 
EXAMS CAN BE PRETTY STRESSFUL BUT 
IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE IF YOU DON'T 
ALWAYS GET A GOLD STAR FOR YOUR 
SPELLINGS WILL COME TOP OF THE 
CLASS WILL TIMES TABLES IT DOESN'T 
MEAN YOU'RE A FAILURE I'VE COME TO 
MEET ONE TEENAGER WHO LEFT SCHOOL 
AT ELEVEN AND NOW RUNS HIS OWN 
CHOCOLATE FACTORY L. HAD PROBLEMS 
AT SCHOOL I'VE GOT DYSLEXIA 
THROUGH THAT MY PARENTS AND I 
DECIDED I WOULD LEAVE SCHOOL AT ELEVEN 
TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT I'VE 
ALWAYS LOVED COOKING AND WORKING 
WITH FOOD L. DISCOVERED THAT I'VE 
GOT A REAL TALENT FOR MAKING 
CHOCOLATE I TURNED IT INTO A 
BUSINESS 
SO LEAVING SCHOOL WAS AN BUSINESS EASY OPTION IT 
WASN'T 
L. THINK 
EASY OPTION LEAVING SCHOOL WAS A LOT HARDER 
THAN STAYING AT SCHOOL WOULD HAVE 
BEEN JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T DO 
WELL AT SCHOOL DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE 
NOT GOING TO BE A SUCCESS 
SO WHY 
DO SOME OF YOU WORRY ABOUT GETTING 
GOOD GRADES 
I THINK MY SCHOOL WORK 
IS QUITE IMPORTANT FOR GETTING A 
JOB 
I THINK MY WORRY AT SCHOOL JOB WOULD BE IF YOU GET ANSWERS WRONG 
OR IF YOU GET ASKED A QUESTION YOU 
DON'T UNDERSTAND 
I THINK IF I'M 
NOT GOOD IN CLASSES THEY MIGHT 
BELLINI AND TEASE ME 
SIR WITH 
SOMEONE IS STRUGGLING AT SCHOOL 
SHOULD THEY BE WORRIED THEY THEY SHOULDN'T BE WORRIED IT'S COMMON 
FOR PEOPLE TO FIND SOME BITS OF 
LEARNING AT SCHOOL CHALLENGING ASK 
FOR HELP MAKE SURE YOU MAKE GOOD 
USE OF THAT HELP AND DON'T FEEL 
EMBARRASSED ABOUT IT 
AND IF YOU 
ARE STILL STRUGGLING AT SCHOOL 
DON'T WORRY YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND 
SOMETHING ELSE YOU ARE GOOD AT 
SUE KEEPERS HAVE FOUND AN UNUSUAL 
WAY TO STOP A BABY MONKEY BECOMING 
LONELY THEY HAVE GIVEN HER TEDDY 
BEAR THIS IS CONCHITA HER MUM IS 
TOO ILL TO LOOK AFTER HER SO ZOO
