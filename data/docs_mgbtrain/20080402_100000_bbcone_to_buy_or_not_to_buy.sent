KNOWN BY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AS TWINKS THIS IS ANITA PRICE GOUGH 
FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS SHE'S LIVED IN THIS TWO BEDROOM TERRACE IN DROITWICH 
HAVING LIVED A ROCK'N'ROLL LIFESTYLE SHE'S NOW TAKEN THE 
HEALTHY OPTION AND WORKS FOR A HERBAL MEDICINE COMPANY 
CENTRAL TO HER LIFE ARE HER WORK AND CATS 
TO SUM HER UP EARTHY WITH A LOVE FOR WILDLIFE ALL THINGS NATURAL AND SEVENTIES MUSIC 
AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH LOVE TO GO AROUND SHE NEEDS TO MOVE ON ACCOUNT OF AN OLD LOVE CALLED ALVIS 
ELVIS NO ALVIS 
AH ALSO HIGH ON HER LOVE OMETER IS HER LAND ON WHICH SHE KEEPS THESE HEBREDIAN SHEEP 
THAT'S FERGUS ONE OF HER LOVELIES 
ANOTHER OF HER LOVELIES IN HUMAN FORM IS GOOD FRIEND MATTHEW 
MANAGER OF A HEALTH SHOP WHO ALSO DOES A SPOT OF MODELLING 
ARMED WITH A GREAT SENSE OF STYLE HE'S COME TO HELP TWINK FIND HER DREAM HOME 
AND WITH SO MUCH LOVE GOING AROUND WE CAN'T GO WRONG 
SO WHAT IS IT WE'RE AFTER COS WE'RE NOT HOUSING THESE ARE WE 
I KNOW THAT FOR SURE WELL WE COULD DO IF YOU PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS 
O. K. WHAT'S THE DREAM 
LET'S WORK BACK FROM THE DREAM TWINKS 
RIGHT WELL THE DREAM IS TO LIVE HERE AMONGST THESE 
RIGHT AND HAVE YOU TRIED THAT 
WE COULD KNOCK THAT UP AND GO TO A TENT SHOP 
WE COULD ACHIEVE THAT QUICKLY WE'VE CLEANED OUT THE BARN I THINK IT'S READY TO GO 
IT'LL ONLY NEED AN EN SUITE BUT I'M AFRAID THE PLANNERS WOULD 
SAY ABSOLUTELY NO WAY O. K. O. K. SO WHAT'S THE SECOND DREAM DREAM 
LIVE AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE O. K. 
I HAVE A LOVELY HOUSE I LIVE QUITE A WAY AWAY 
O. K. AND I WANT AN EQUALLY LOVELY HOUSE 
AND WHAT ARE WE TALKING A COTTAGE A BUNGALOW WHAT ARE WE AFTER

GIVE ME THE CRITERIA WHAT DO YOU THINK TWINKS NEEDS 
SHE HAS TO HAVE A GARAGE O. K. FOR THIS CAR 
ALVIS FOR THIS ALVIS CAR OF COURSE ALVIS 
IS IT A BRAND OF CAR YES IT'S A CLASSIC CAR FROM NINETEEN TWENTIES NINETEEN THIRTIES 
THAT'S THE CAR I LOVE AND I HAVEN'T GOT IT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOT A GARAGE 
WHAT OTHER SPECIFICS MATTHEW 
THE UPSTAIRS DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING AS LONG AS THERE'S A SPARE ROOM FOR MYSELF 
SO HOW MANY BEDROOMS ARE WE TALKING I DON'T CARE ONE TWO TEN 
THAT'S A VERY CASUAL APPROACH TO HOUSE HUNTING NORMALLY WE TRY AND HONE IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE 
I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IT'S CASUAL 
WHAT I WOULD LIKE IS A HOUSE CLOSER TO THE FIELD RIGHT 
IT'S GOT TO BE AWAY FROM THE ROAD BECAUSE OF MY CATS WHICH ARE MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY HOW MANY CATS 
HOW MANY I HAVE FOUR AND THEY'RE ALL DELIGHTFUL 
RIGHT O. K. IT'S ME AND THE CATS AGAINST THE WORLD O. K. 
SO POINT ONE AWAY FROM THE ROAD 
RIGHT POINT TWO IT'S GOT TO HAVE AN OFFICE SPACE 
AT THE MOMENT I'VE GOT TWELVE BY TWELVE ROOM THAT'S HEAVING YEAH 
RIGHT SO I NEED EQUAL OR BIGGER 
I WOULD IMAGINE IT WOULD BE THE TASK FROM HELL 
ARE YOU I'LL ASK MATTHEW 
ARE YOU MAD 
THAT WASN'T THE QUESTION 
IS TWINKS FUSSY AND DIFFICULT OR IS SHE QUITE 
CALM AND EASY TO PLEASE BE CAREFUL

IN THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MARK BECAUSE I WANT SOME PENNIES TO 
BY THE CAR OTHERWISE IT DEFEATS THE WHOLE OBJECT OF MOVING HOW MUCH DOES THE CAR COST BY THE WAY 
ANYTHING FROM I DUNNO TEN THOUSAND TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
I WOULD BE AT THE BOTTOM END NOT THE TOP END

AN UNCANNY EXPERIENCE WELL COS I WAS OUT THERE 
I MET A LOOK ALIKEY FOR YOU AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS EXCEPTIONALLY ACCURATE 
GOOD O. K. SHALL WE TALK ABOUT THE HOUSES WHAT HAVE YOU GOT 
I HAVE FOUND THIS IT'S QUITE NEAR TO WORCESTER 
IT'S A MILE AWAY FROM THAT PIECE OF LAND SHE LOVES 
DECOR INSIDE IS WHAT I'VE FOCUSED ON GORGEOUS GORGEOUS GORGEOUS I HAVE A QUESTION 
GO FOR IT IS IT NEAR A MAIN ROAD 
UM DON'T ANSWER THAT NOW THEN 
I PROBABLY WON'T ANSWER THAT NOW BUT I THINK THE CATS ARE GOING TO BE FINE 
ALL RIGHT THIS IS MY PROPERTY 
THE TEAM HAVE KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PROVERBIAL BALL PARK WITH THIS ONE 
FROM THIS SHE CAN JUST ABOUT SEE HER BELOVED SHEEP 
REALLY YES REALLY 
IT'S NOT ON A MAIN ROAD 
AND THERE'S SOMETHING VERY VERY SPECIAL AT THE BOTTOM OF HER GARDEN 
THAT IS FAMED FOR SPITTING 
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUR WEIRD UNCLE NO RIGHT 
THERE YOU GO A BIT OF A CONUNDRUM YEAH IT IS 
A BIT OF A CONUNDRUM 
FOR THE WILD CARD TOGETHER WE HAVE GONE FOR THIS 
THIS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN YOUR FIRST CHOICE 
BUT WE'RE QUITE PLEASED WITH THIS WE ARE 
IT'S A BIT OF A PROJECT BUT WITH SOME DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL 
I THINK SHE COULD TURN THIS INTO HER PERFECT COUNTRY IDYLL 
LET'S SEE IF SHE LIKES ANY OF THESE HOUSES BY COMMENCING THE VIEWINGS AT MY PROPERTY 
PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
AND I'VE GONE FOR THIS THREE BEDROOM SEMI ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF WORCESTER 
I THINK IT'S GREAT VALUE AND OFFERS ALL THE SPACE TWINK WILL NEED 
AND THE CURRENT FELINE INHABITANTS SEEM PURR FECTLY CONTENT HERE 
AND YOU'VE EVEN GOT THEM A MAIN ROAD 
O. K. TWINKS AND MATTY HERE WE ARE AT PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
NOW BEFORE YOU UTTER A WORD BEFORE YOU SINK YOUR CLAWS INTO ME AND SAY 
KRISTIAN THE ROAD THIS IS A GORGEOUS PROPERTY 
IT'S GOT A LOVELY INTERIOR AND WE'RE ONLY A MILE AWAY FROM YOUR FIELD 
FAB O. K. ABSOLUTELY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
LIKE YOU'VE SAID ABOUT THE ROAD BUT I'M SURE THE BEAUTY LIES WITHIN 
MATTHEW ARE YOU CONVINCED I DON'T LIKE THE ROAD REALLY 
FOR THE CATS THAT'S MY HOLD ON ONE SECOND 
RIGHT THE OWNER HAS GOT FOUR CATS 
AND SHE DOESN'T STRUGGLE AT ALL WITH THEM 
THANK YOU NO NO HONESTLY JUST STAY THERE 
SHE LOVES THE AREA GREAT GARDEN AT THE BACK LOVELY 
I THINK YOU ARE GONNA LIKE IT OPEN MIND IN YOU GO 
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THANK YOU GO ON THEN QUICK 
STAY IN THERE AND WE'LL DO THE HEADPHONES 
WATCH THE STEP 
KRISTIAN YOU AND YOUR PROPERTY HUNTING CREW BETTER HAVE DONE PRETTY WELL WITH THE INSIDE 
BECAUSE THE OUTSIDE DIDN'T GO DOWN SO WELL DID IT 
INSIDE IS BEAUTIFUL ALL RIGHT 
OH I SAY MATTHEW LOOK WE HAVE A PINK SUITE 
IT'S JUST LACKING THE PERFECT PINK TOILET ROLL HOLDER 
IT DOES NEED ACCESSORISING IT HAS TO BE SAID 
WHERE DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET ONE KRISTIAN'S JUMPER FANTASTIC 
IT'LL LOOK LOVELY WRAPPED ROUND A TOILET ROLL PERFECT 
AND THAT'S AN INSULT ARE YOU SEEING THAT AS AN INSULT 
NICE CARPET IT'S QUITE SPACIOUS IT IS SPACIOUS OH I SAY IT IS 
YES NICE NICE SUITE I'M SURE THAT DOESN'T COME WITH IT 
I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT WALLPAPER IS VERY ATTRACTIVE 
I THINK MATT'S COME JUST TO JEOPARDISE MY CHOICE 
DATED WELL IT IS 
I THINK PERSONALLY TO BE HONEST YOU CAN COME AND PAINT IT FOR ME 
LISTEN DATED THINGS CAN BE LOVABLE 
I'M JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ROAD 
IS THIS IT FOR DOWNSTAIRS 
I DON'T KNOW LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK RIGHT 
KITCHEN NOW THEN 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY SMALLER THAN THE ONE I HAVE 
BUT YOU DON'T NEED A HUGE KITCHEN 
IT'S DONE IN A KIND OF CUTE LITTLE WAY I THINK 
I THINK THEY'RE SAYING CUTE IN THE SMALL SENSE 
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR EVERYTHING 
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED COOKER WHICH I NEVER USE 
SINK I NEVER USE THAT EITHER SO THAT'S FINE 
NOW I WONDER IF KRISTIAN HAD GOT THIS IN HIS MIND FOR MY OFFICE 
I LIKE THIS OFFICE A LOT YEAH 
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA BE SUITABLE FOR IT WOULD BE BIG ENOUGH 
NICE BIG WINDOWS YES 
WHICH WAY ARE WE GOING MATTHEW 
IN HERE I THINK ONE WOULD PRESUME THEN 
A LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM 
A LITTLE GIRL LIVES HERE SOMEWHERE BLESS HER 
SO SINGLE BEDROOM WOULDN'T GET A DOUBLE 
I THINK IF YOU TOOK ALL YOUR STUFF FROM YOUR HOUSE 
AND PUT IT ALL IN HERE YOU WOULD BE VERY CLAUSTROPHOBIC 
I'LL TAKE THAT CRITICISM 
AND I'LL SAY HOLD YOURSELF A GARAGE SALE CAR BOOTY TYPE STYLEE 
YES SELL A LOT OF YOUR BRIC A BRAC YES 
AND MAKE YOURSELF A PROFIT YES 
ADOPT MORE CATS YES BUY MORE LAND 
YES DON'T MOVE HERE COS IT'S NEAR A MAIN ROAD THOUGH 
THE ONLY THING I CAN SEE THAT ROOM BEING USED FOR IS YOUR OFFICE BUT THAT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH NO 
O. K. NO TWO OF THOSE AFTER YOU THANK YOU 
WELL IT'S SMALL 
BUT I ACTUALLY QUITE LIKE THIS 
IT HAS A BIT OF PERSONALITY IN WHAT PLANET IT DOES 
I THINK PERSONALLY YOU DON'T LIKE THIS SHUT UP 
YOU SEE HOW HE PRE EMPTED THAT SENTENCE I WOULD PERSONALLY THINK YOU DON'T LIKE THIS ROOM 
HE'S CONDITIONING HER TO HATE IT 
OH OH YOU'VE TURNED ON TO HIM YOU REALLY HAVE WELL YOU KNOW 
IT'S VERY DATED BUT IT WOULD DO 
CAN I SUGGEST AN IDEA FOR MY PROPERTY GO ON 
YOU INVITE MATT TO HAVE A LONG WALK 
AND WE'LL START THE THING WITHOUT HIM 
LOFT HATCH THAT'S A BIT WORRYING 
I'D HAVE TO GET THAT CHECKED OUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS ARE THEY TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING 
THERE'S NO CONSPIRACIES HERE WE'RE ALL FRIENDS 
WE'VE COME HERE TO HELP THEM WOULD YOU BELIEVE WE'RE ALL FRIENDS ALL RIGHT HERE WE GO 
LOOK AT IT THOUGH THE HALL IS VERY BRIGHT 
OH RIGHT 
ANOTHER PINK ROOM 
YES NOW THIS AGAIN I WOULD THINK IS NOT THE MAIN BEDROOM IT CAN'T BE 
WE'RE FRIENDS WE'RE ALL FRIENDS WE'RE ALL FRIENDS NO CONSPIRACY 
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS 
BUT HERE THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM SO 
IT COULD BE A NICE BEDROOM FOR WHEN I COME OVER 
A SPARE ROOM YES 
IF MATTHEW IS HAPPY WITH THIS HE MIGHT TURN HIS FROWN UPSIDE DOWN 
OH HERE'S ONE THAT ISN'T PINK AH NOW THIS IS A BETTER SIZE 
IT'S A BETTER SIZE 
I LIKE A BEDROOM UNCLUTTERED SIMPLE 
IF YOU IMAGINE NONE OF THIS FURNITURE 
JUST A BED TABLES IT WOULD BE QUITE BIG 
HEY HEY HEY COME ON 
GET ON YES YES YES YES ALL RIGHT YES YES 
I'M HAPPY NOW I'M HAPPY NOW 
NOW YOU SEE HOW CLOSE WE ARE I'M SORRY THAT 
I'VE GOT TO SAY I WOULDN'T BE PREPARED TO RISK THAT WITH THE CATS 
NO NO DEFINITELY NOT 
THE POINT IS CATS ARE QUITE CLEVER I'VE HAD A FEW CATS IN MY TIME 
NOT WHEN A JUGGERNAUT'S COMING AT IT GOING AGH 
WHAT'S THE PHRASE LIKE A CAT IN THE HEADLIGHTS MIAOOOOWW 
I CAN SEE THE LOVELY POINTS OF THIS HOUSE I HONESTLY CAN 
UNFORTUNATELY KRISTIAN YOU'VE PUT ME RIGHT BY A MAIN ROAD 
NICE TRY PITY IT WASN'T SOMEBODY WHO CHOSE IT WITH BRAINS 
BUT THERE WE ARE 
OOH OOH OOH OOH OOH 
WELL 
I TELL YOU WHAT IN ALL MY TIME ON TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS FACE 
I'LL GIVE IT DO YOU WANT IT AGAIN GO ON 
RIGHT HINT AND TIP FOR THEM 
MATTHEW 
KRISTIAN IS LIVID WITH YOU IN PARTICULAR 
FROM YOUR BEHAVIOUR IN THERE AND YOUR ATTACKING OF HIS HOUSE RIGHT 
NOW THE ONE THING NEITHER YOU OR TWINKS EVER MENTIONED WAS THE GARAGE 
AND THAT WAS VITAL IN THIS WHOLE JIGSAW PUZZLE OF HOUSING TWINKS 
THAT'S BECAUSE WE COULDN'T GET PAST THAT ROAD ALL RIGHT 
THAT'S KRISTIAN AND HIS PROPERTY TEAM'S FAULT FOR A START 
I'M LIKE A PEACE ENVOY HERE BECAUSE LOOK AT THIS

O. K. NOW THIS COULD BE ALVIS IN THERE 
THE CAR COULD BE IN THERE YES RIGHT RIGHT 
BUT THE HOUSE IS NOT FOR TWINK RIGHT 
I KNOW THAT 
THE CATS CANNOT LIVE IN THIS HOUSE 
MAYBE THE PRICE IS REALLY CHEAP 
AND IF THE PRICE WAS CHEAP THEN MAYBE THIS ALL BECOMES GOOD NO

GOOD OLD TWINKS SO FAR EVERY ROOM THERE THAT'S YOUR AIRING CUPBOARD BUT IT'S A GOOD SIZE

WELL I'M NOT KEEN ON CARPETS ANYWAY 
NO WOODEN FLOORING SO THEY WOULD ALL GO 
WOODEN WHATEVER THEY'D ALL HAVE TO GO THAT'S GOOD 
NOT THE FIRE ITSELF BUT THE FACT THERE'S A GAS POINT TO IT SO YOU COULD HAVE A TASTEFUL GAS FIRE 
SHE'S PLEASED WITH THE GAS POINT SHE'S PLEASED SHE CAN CHANGE THAT FIRE 
I'M PLEASED THAT SHE'S PLEASED 
IT'S ALL DOABLE AND I KNOW YOU LIKE BUNGALOWS I LOVE BUNGALOWS I ABSOLUTELY

AH I WAS ABOUT TO SAY FABULOUS A DOWNSTAIRS TOILET BUT WE'RE IN A BUNGALOW WE'RE IN A BUNGALOW 
SO OF COURSE IT WOULD BE A DOWNSTAIRS TOILET 
IT'S A BIT SMALL FOR ME IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S ALL DOABLE

A METAL TREAT FABULOUS HAVE YOU ORGANISED THIS 
YES ALL RIGHT I'VE PUT A CALL IN 
NOW WHILE THEY'RE MAKING THAT RATHER TOUGH DECISION HERE'S A QUICK RECAP FOR YOU AT HOME 
INDEEDY AND MY PROPERTY WAS THIS THREE BEDROOM SEMI 
SENSATIONAL ON THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE WELL IT WAS JUST A MILE FROM TWINKS' LAND 
LOADS OF ROOMS AND A GOOD SIZE GARDEN 
BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN AT ALL DID YOU IT'S ON A ROAD 
WELL YES BUT THAT ASIDE IT IS GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY AT TWO HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
TEN THOUSAND OVER HER BUDGET BUT IT'S ALSO NOT AS GOOD AS HOUSE TWO MY SUGGESTION 
THREE BEDROOMS ONLY A GALLOP AWAY FROM TWINKS' FIELD LLAMAS GEESE AND DONKEYS IN THE BACK 
AND WITH A FREE CAT AND I THINK SHE EVEN SAW A HERD OF WILDEBEEST 
YES PROBABLY STOMPING THROUGH THE INTERIOR IT DOES NEED WORK DEAR 
TO WHICH I THINK SHE SAID ALL DOABLE 
IT'S AT THE PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
BUT MOVING ON AND TO THINK I WAS NERVOUS SHOWING TWINK OUR WILD CARD 
TRUE THE TWO BEDROOM BUNGALOW DOES NEED SOME UPLIFTING 
BUT I THINK SHE REALLY SEEMED TO LIKE EVERYTHING BEING ON ONE LEVEL 
WITH THE POTENTIAL OF BECOMING A FANTASTIC HOME FOR TWINKS CATS CARS AND WINE 
ALL FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
POUNDS 
TWINKS AND MATTHEW 
YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO TEST DRIVE SURPRISINGLY NOT KRISTIAN'S CHOICE

NOW WE HAVE HAD THE MYSTERY TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY SURVEYOR GO ROUND THIS HOUSE 
O. K. IT'S NOT LEGALLY BINDING BUT HE HAS SEEN A FEW THINGS THAT HE WISHES TO RAISE 
KRISTIAN WHAT DID YOU HAVE FROM HIM 
O. K. WE TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLY GOING INTO THE ATTIC DIDN'T WE 
UH HMM IT COULD BE TRICKY COS YOU'D BE UNLIKELY TO 
GET PLANNING PERMISSION COS THE OTHER BUNGALOWS HAVEN'T GONE INTO THE ATTIC 
THERE'S NOT MUCH HEADROOM UP THERE AND THERE ARE T. D. A. TRUSSES 
THAT'S THE WAY THE ROOF IS WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GO INTO THAT SPACE HOWEVER O. K. 
HAVING SAID THAT OUR BEADY CHAP DID SPOT THAT TO THE SIDE OF THE PROPERTY 
THERE IS EIGHT FOOT OF LAND DOING NOTHING 
IT'S GOING BEGGING SO IF YOU WERE LOOKING TO EXTEND 
GO SIDEWAYS GIVING YOU A BIGGER LOUNGE AND A BIGGER MASTER BEDROOM 
FABULOUS VERY CLEVER ISN'T IT THANK YOU EDWARD 
IN THE LOUNGE THE BIG GAS FIRE IS ACTUALLY A GAS FIRE BOILER AND HE RECOMMENDED 
COS IT'S QUITE OLD IT MIGHT BE WORK REPLACING RENEW IT
