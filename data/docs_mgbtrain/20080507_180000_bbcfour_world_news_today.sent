THIS IS B. B. C. WORLD NEWS TODAY WITH 
ME KIRSTY LANG BURMA CAUTIOUSLY 
OPENS ITS DOORS TO SOME FOREIGN AID 
BUT HAS HELPED TRICKLES THEN A 
DIPLOMATIC ROW IS BREWING AT THE UN 
AS HELP TRICKLES IN 
RUSSIA'S NEW PRESIDENT TAKES OVER 
BUT HOW MUCH INDEPENDENCE WILL 
DMITRY MEDVEDEV HAVE WITH PUTIN IN 
THE WINGS 
HILLARY ON THE ROPES AFTER BARACK 
OBAMA WIDENS THE GAP IN THE RACE 
FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION 
WHEN IS THE RIGHT MOMENT TO GIVE 
UP 
AS I HAVE SAID ON MANY UP OCCASIONS NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS 
I WILL WORK FOR THE NOMINEE OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY BECAUSE WE MUST 
WIN IN NOVEMBER 
WELCOME SOME FOREIGN AID IS 
GETTING INTO THE DESPERATE 
SURVIVORS OF BURMA'S CYCLONE BUT 
MUCH MORE IS NEEDED AND 
BUREAUCRATIC OBSTACLES REMAIN 
NEIGHBOURING INDIA AND THAILAND 
HAVE SENT PLANES PACKED WITH 
SUPPLIES AND BURMA'S RULING 
GENERALS HAVE GIVEN A UNITED 
NATIONS PLANE PERMISSION TO LAND A 
SMALL TEAM OF EXPERTS ARE ON BOARD 
THEY HAVE STILL NOT ISSUED VISAS TO 
INTERNATIONAL RELIEF WORKERS IN ANY 
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER THESE PICTURES 
TAKEN BY NASA FROM SPACE SHOW THE 
EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE 
CYCLONE IN THE IRRAWADDY DELTA 
WHERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THOUGHT 
TO HAVE DIED AND THE UN ESTIMATES 
THAT ONE MILLION PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN 
THE OPEN AND IN URGENT NEED OF FOOD 
AND DRINKING WATER OUR 
CORRESPONDENT REPORTS FROM 
NEIGHBOURING THAILAND 
A HANDFUL OF SURVIVORS PLUCKED FROM 
THE MUD AND THE MISERY DAY FIVE OF 
BURMA'S CATASTROPHE AND THE RESCUE 
OPERATION IS DESPERATELY SLOW VAST 
AREAS REMAIN UNDER WATER SO FAR 
ONLY A FEW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAVED 
FROM THE MOST ISOLATED AREAS WEARY 
AND THIRSTY ON THE GROUND DEAD 
CATTLE AND AN INCREASINGLY 
DESPERATE SEARCH FOR CLEAN DRINKING 
WATER AND FOOD 
DEAD BODIES LYING 
ON THE GROUND ALSO DEAD BODIES 
FLOATING IN THE RIVER THEY DON'T 
KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE THEIR FEELINGS 
IN SOME AREAS WE KNOW THAT THE 
AREA IS COMPLETELY UNDER SALT WATER 
DRINKING WATER AND FOOD SOME 
PEOPLE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DRINKING 
WATER AND FOOD AND LAST ASSISTANCE 
GETS INTO THOSE KINDS OF AREAS VERY 
SOON THE DEATH TOLL WILL RISE 
AND LAST WE HOPE WE WILL BE ABLE 
TO REACH EVERYONE BUT IT IS A RACE 
AGAINST TIME 
THESE ARE THE LATEST 
PICTURES TO EMERGE FROM THEM AT 
SATURDAY'S TROPICAL CYCLONE 
EMERGE FROM BURMA IN THE STORM 
BATTERED CITY OF RANGOON SOME 
DISTRICTS ARE GETTING CLEAN WATER 
AND OTHER BASICS LOCAL STOCKS OF 
AID ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED THE 
BURMESE AUTHORITIES ARE CLEARLY 
OVERWHELMED LACKING THE HEAVY 
MACHINERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO 
SPEED THINGS UP MORE FOREIGN AID 
IS GETTING THROUGH BUT RED TAPE IN 
THIS RECLUSIVE NATION IS CAUSING 
GROWING FRUSTRATION IT MAY BE 
ALREADY COSTING LIVES 
IT IS AN 
ISOLATED COUNTRY AS YOU KNOW ONE 
OF THE MOST ISOLATED I KNOW WE 
BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
EVERYTHING THEY HAVE SAID SO FAR 
RECOGNISES THIS IS A MASSIVE 
HUMANITARIAN CHALLENGE WE HOPE 
THAT WE WILL GET THEIR CO OPERATION 
ON THAT WE NEED THE FLOODGATES TO 
OPEN IF YOU LIKE 
ANOTHER LOAN 
BURMESE HELICOPTER BRINGS IN 
SUPPLIES TO THE FLOODED DELTA IT 
IS A START THIS DISASTER IS ON A 
SCALE TO MATCH THE TSUNAMI IT 
NEEDS AN ARMY OF BOATS AND 
HELICOPTERS TO SAVE THE SURVIVORS 
JOINING US NOW ON THE PHONE FROM 
BURMA'S IRRAWADDY DELTA IS OUR 
REPORTER PAUL DANAHAR TELL US WHAT 
KIND OF THINGS YOU HAVE BEEN SEEING 
TODAY 
I WENT TO A VILLAGE WITH TODAY SEVERAL HUNDRED HOMES COMPLETELY 
DEVASTATED PEOPLE WERE SCAVENGING 
FOR WHAT NATURE HAD LEFT BEHIND 
THERE WAS NOT MUCH THEY WERE 
DRAGGING WOOD AND CORRUGATED IRON 
TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES THEY WERE 
THE LUCKY ONES THEY ARE ACCESSIBLE 
THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE THAT ARE MISSING BEHIND THE 
BROKEN BRIDGES AND BLOCKED ROADS 
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET TO THEM IS 
BY HELICOPTER OR BY BOAT MOST OF 
THE BOATS WERE DESTROYED WHEN THE 
TIDAL SURGE HIT THERE ARE NOT THAT 
MANY HELICOPTERS IN THIS COUNTRY 
THAT MEANS THERE ARE ALMOST A 
MILLION PEOPLE WITH NO FOOD NO 
SHELTER AND NO IMMEDIATE PROSPECT 
OF GETTING EITHER ONE 
THE TOP U. S. 
DIPLOMAT IN BURMA HAS TOLD 
REPORTERS TODAY THAT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
MAY HAVE DIED IN THE CYCLONE THERE 
IS MOUNTING FRUSTRATION ABOUT AGE 
NOT GETTING IN HOW MUCH EVIDENCE 
HAVE YOU SEEN OF AN INTERNATIONAL 
RELIEF EFFORT ON THE GROUND 
LOT TO BE HONEST WE HAVE DRIVEN 
DOWN AS FAST AS WE COULD DO UNTIL 
WE WERE TOLD THAT THE BRIDGEHEAD 
WAS BROKEN WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED 
TO HAVE SEEN LOTS MORE TRUCKS GOING 
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WE SAW A 
HANDFUL BUT NOWHERE NEAR THE MAN 
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY NEEDED THE 
PEOPLE THAT WE SPOKE TO ALONG THE 
WAY SAID THEY HAD HAD NOTHING 
NOTHING NEAR THE AMOUNT THEY WERE 
NOT STARVING NOT WATERLOGGED BUT 
THEY HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES HAD NO 
FOOD AND HAD TO TAKE WATER FROM THE 
LOCAL WELL THAT WAS COMPLETELY 
CONTAMINATED THERE IS NO HELP FOR 
THEM AT THEIR LEVEL THERE IS NOT 
ENOUGH INFRASTRUCTURE OR RESOURCES 
TO GET TO THE PEOPLE TRAPPED BEHIND 
THE FLOODED AREAS IN THE IRRAWADDY 
DELTA I DON'T THINK ENOUGH IS 
BEING DONE OF IS THE THAT IS THE 
CASE OTHERWISE THE GENERALS HERE 
WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERING WHAT IS A 
HUGE MOVE FOR THEM OPENING UP THE 
DOORS TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY OBVIOUSLY 
INTERNATIONAL PATIENCE IS WEARING 
THIN THE WHITE HOUSE HAS 
COMPLAINED THAT BURMA HAS THAT 
ANSWERED ITS OFFERS OF AID OF THE MILITARY JUNTA AT 
CRITICISM OF THE MILITARY JUNTA AT A CEREMONY REWARDING AUNG SAN SUU 
KYI THE BURMESE PRO DEMOCRACY 
ACTIVIST THE FRENCH PRIME MINISTER 
HAS CALLED BURMA'S REFUSAL OF A DAY 
CATCH HIS TRIP A CATASTROPHE 
WITHIN A CATASTROPHE HE SAYS THE 
UN SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD FORCE 
THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW AID 
SUPPLIES INTO THE CYCLONE HIT AREA 
THIS WAS THE RESPONSE FROM THE 
MAN'S HUMANITARIAN CO ORDINATOR 
WE'RE NOT IN THAT SITUATION YET I 
HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR BERNARD 
KOUCHNER THE FRENCH FOREIGN 
MINISTER AND SHARE HIS FRUSTRATION 
I THINK WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS WE 
NEED TO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHORITIES 
TO MOVE FURTHER AND NOT BLUDGEON 
THEM OVER THE HEAD WITH THREATS OF 
THIS KIND I THINK WE CAN GET THERE 
I THINK THAT IS THE WAY FORWARD 
RATHER THAN THAT KIND OF APPROACH 
WHICH IS NOT APPROPRIATE JOHN JOHN HOLMES WAS VERY MUCH BACKED UP BY 
AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER WHO 
URGED COUNTRIES TO FOCUS ON HELPING 
THE PEOPLE OF BURMA RATHER THAN 
CRITICISING ITS GOVERNMENT FOR THE 
LATEST ON A DIPLOMATIC ROW LET'S 
GO LIVE TO THE UN AND OUR 
CORRESPONDENT LAURA TREVELYAN 
LAURA WILL THERE BE MUCH SYMPATHY 
FOR THE FRENCH DEMAND FOR STRONGER 
UN ACTION AND WORDS 
WELL AS A 
FIRST STEP TOWARDS WHAT BERNARD 
KOUCHNER TALKED ABOUT AS A UN 
SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 
COMPELLING THE BURMESE MILITARY TO 
ACCEPT INTERNATIONAL OFFERS OF AID 
WHAT THE FRENCH TRIED TO DO HERE 
THIS MORNING IN NEW YORK WAS GET 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO HAVE A 
BRIEFING BY THE UN'S HEAD OF 
HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS WHO YOU JUST 
HEARD FROM EVEN AT FRENCH REQUEST 
FOR A BRIEFING WHICH WAS ALL 
HAPPENING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WAS 
BLOCKED EVEN THAT I AM TOLD 
RUSSIA AND CHINA ARE OBJECTED 
COUNTRIES WHICH SEE THE SITUATION 
IN BURMA AS AN INTERNAL MATTER IT 
ISN'T THAT IT IS A NATURAL 
DISASTER THEY DON'T SEE IT AS A 
THREAT TO SECURITY THERE DOES NOT 
LOOK LIKE THE FRENCH EFFORT WILL GO 
ANYWHERE BUT THE FRENCH WANT TO 
PERSIST 
IN PRACTICAL TERMS WHAT A PERSIST UN OFFICIALS SAYING THAT THEY NEED 
FROM THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT WHAT 
ARE 
WHAT THE UN WANTS THE BURMESE ARE TO DO IS WAVE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR 
VISAS FOR STAFF TO GET IN UP TO 
ONE HUNDRED UN STAFF HAVE APPLIED FOR VISAS 
WE HEARD FROM JOHN HOLMES THIS 
MORNING THAT THE BURMESE HAVE NOT 
GRANTED ANY NEW APPLICATIONS ALSO 
THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT WANTS 
INTERNATIONAL STAFF THERE 
DELIVERING AID TO BE COMPLETE BY 
BURMESE NATIONAL THE YEAR THAT 
ONLY ASIAN UN STAFF HAVE BEEN 
ALLOWED INTO THE COUNTRY WE HEAR 
THAT THERE IS A PICTURE OF RATHER 
POLITICAL DECISIONS IT SEEMS 
BEING MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT THE 
UN SECRETARY GENERAL BAN KI MOON 
HAS URGED THE GOVERNMENT IN STRONG 
DIPLOMATIC LANGUAGE HE SAID THAT 
IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE THAT CAN 
THE GOVERNMENT HELP AID WORKERS 
WHAT IS THE WAY FOR WORDS 
DIPLOMATICALLY COULD THIS TRAGEDY 
PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN UP A 
VERY CLOSED COUNTRY WITHIN HOURS 
DOCTOR ZARNI A VISITING RESEARCH 
FELLOW AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY AND THE 
FOUNDER OF THE FREE BURMA COALITION 
DO YOU THINK THIS INTERNATIONAL 
CRITICISM OF THE BURMESE REGIME 
THAT WE ARE HEARING FROM FRANCE IN 
PARTICULAR AND TO A LESSER EXTENT 
THE UNITED STATES COULD BACKFIRE 
ABSOLUTELY THE SECURITY COUNCIL IS 
NOT THE APPROPRIATE 
BLAME GAME ALSO THE U. S. OFFER OF AID WITH VERY STRONG CONDITIONALITY 
IS WILL NOT HELP EITHER IF THE 
DEMOCRACY SUPPORTING GOVERNMENTS 
AND THE BURMESE JUNTA UP AT THE 
ACTUAL NEEDS OF THE BURMESE PEOPLE 
ESPECIALLY THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES 
ON THE GROUND AS THE CENTRE OF 
POLICY DISCUSSION I THINK WE CAN 
MOVE FORWARD THE LAST THING EITHER 
THE GENTLE OR THE WESTERN 
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD DO NOW IS TO 
EXPLOIT THE SITUATION POLITICALLY 
OR TO DEFEND IT FROM THE POLITICAL 
ATTACK THIS IS NOT IN THE INTEREST 
OF THE BURMESE PEOPLE 
ON THE OTHER 
HAND SOME PRO DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS 
HAVE SAID LOOK THIS CYCLONE 
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY AS IT IS COULD 
PRESENT AN HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY FOR 
THINGS TO CHANGE IN BURMA THEY 
HAVE AFTER ALL OPENED THE DOOR A 
LITTLE BIT SHOULDN'T THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BE PUSHING 
IT TO OPEN FURTHER 
IT WOULD BE A 
TRAGIC MISTAKE TO USE THIS ALREADY 
MASSIVE NATIONAL TRAGEDY TO PUSH 
FOR POLITICAL AGENDAS HOWEVER 
WORTHWHILE DEMOCRACY AND OPENING UP 
A SOCIETY MAY BE HER BUT I THINK 
THE KEY AS THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME 
MINISTER SAID FORGET IT THE 
DICTATORSHIP OR DEMOCRACY AND FOCUS 
ON WHAT THE ACTUAL PEOPLE NEED ON 
THE GROUND THEY NEED CLEAN WATER 
FOOD SAFE SHELTER MEDICINE THEY 
NEED FOR THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT TO 
GO AHEAD IN CERTAIN AREAS WITH THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM IT IS 
COMPLETELY MISGUIDED FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY 
THE WESTERN GOVERNMENTS TAKING 
THIS ISSUE TO THE UN SECURITY 
COUNCIL INSTEAD OF WORKING WITH 
ASIAN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY 
HAVING GOOD ACCESS TO THE COUNTRY 
IN TERMS OF A DELIVERY IS WRONG 
WHAT YOU THINK THE CHANCES ARE OF 
THERE BEING A POPULAR UPRISING IN 
THE WAKE OF THE CYCLONE AND PEOPLE 
BEING SO FRUSTRATED WITH THE REGIME 
THAT THEY COULD TURN AGAINST IT 
THE HISTORY OF POPULAR UPRISINGS IN 
OUR COUNTRY FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS 
I LIVED THERE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF MY 
LIFE MYSELF HAS BEEN A 
CATEGORICAL FAILURE WE HAVE JUST 
WITNESSED THE POPULAR UPRISING IN 
SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER LED BY THE 
MONKS WE KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS 
WERE THE REGIME IS STILL 
ENTRENCHED THE POPULAR OPPOSITION 
HAS BEEN COMPLETELY WEAKENED 
INDEED LOTS OF PEOPLE SEE THIS 
CYCLONE AS A FORM OF DIVINE 
RETRIBUTION DON'T THEY 
OH YES I 
WROTE THIS IN MY ARTICLE TODAY IN 
THE INDEPENDENT THE BURMESE PEOPLE 
ARE GENERALLY TAKING IT AS A VERY 
VERY BAD OMEN THERE IS SO MUCH 
CORRUPTION AND REPRESSION ANGER 
AND RAGE IN ALL SECTORS OF THE 
SOCIETY PERHAPS THIS IS THIS 
CAN BE A WAKE UP CALL TO ALL THE 
OTHER PEOPLE WHO LIVE INSIDE THE 
COUNTRY AND PEOPLE OUTSIDE WHO 
WANT TO SEE THE BURMESE PEOPLE WITH 
A DECENT LIFE START LOOKING AT 
RECONCILIATION RATHER THAN UPRISING 
OR REGIME CHANGE OR BRINGING THE 
REGIME TO ITS KNEES I THINK THE 
MOST IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO 
DEPOLITICISE THIS HUMAN TRAGEDY 
SOFTLY SOFTLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
SOME OF THE DAY'S OTHER NEWS 
PROTESTERS IN THE LEBANESE CAPITAL 
BEIRUT HAVE SET UP BARRICADES OF 
BURNING TYRES IN SUPPORT OF A ONE 
DAY GENERAL STRIKE LEBANON'S MAIN 
TRADE UNIONS CALLED THE ACTIONS IN 
SUPPORT OF HIGHER PAY AND ARE 
BACKED BY THE OPPOSITION HEZBOLLAH 
A NEW ERA OF RELATIONS BETWEEN 
CHINA AND A PLAQUE JAPAN HAS BEEN 
PLEDGED BY THE COUNTRIES' LEADERS 
FOLLOWING THEIR FIRST SUMMER FOR A 
DECADE IN TOKYO THE CHINESE 
PRESIDENT AND JAPANESE PRIME 
MINISTER VOWED TO RESOLVE THEIR 
ECONOMIC DISPUTES AND SAID THEY 
WOULD NOT ALLOW THEIR HISTORY TO 
DIVIDE THEM 
THE IRISH PUBLIC HAS A NEW PRIME 
MINISTER AFTER THE ELECTION TO THE 
POST OF THE FORMER FINANCE MINISTER 
BRIAN COWEN HERE PERSIS BERTIE 
AHERN WHO ARE STEP DOWN AFTER ELEVEN 
YEARS IN OFFICE BECAUSE OF 
CONTINUING PRESSURE ABOUT HIS 
FINANCES HE REPLACES HE DENIES 
WRONGDOING WRONGDOING GORDON BROWN FACES TROUBLE OVER A 
REFERENDUM ABOUT SCOTTISH 
INDEPENDENCE WENDY ALEXANDER OF 
THE SCOTTISH LABOUR PARTY SAID 
SHABBAT SAID THAT SHE DID NOT 
HEAR THE VERDICT OF THE SCOTTISH 
PEOPLE AND BRING IT ON GORDON 
BROWN SAID THAT SHE WAS NOT CALLING 
FOR AN EARLY REFERENDUM 
VLADIMIR PUTIN'S PROTEGE A LUNT 
YOUNG LAWYER WHO HAS NEVER HELD 
ELECTED OFFICE BEFORE HAS BEEN 
SWORN IN AS THE NEW PRESIDENT OF 
RUSSIA THE THE DIMITRI BED AND 
DMITRY MEDVEDEV HAS THE BIG JOB AT 
THE KREMLIN MR. PUTIN WILL BECOME 
PRIME MINISTER THIS IS AN 
UNPRECEDENTED PERIOD OF DUAL 
LEADERSHIP AS OUR MOSCOW 
CORRESPONDENT REPORTS 
INSIDE THE KREMLIN'S MAIN PALACE 
VLADIMIR PUTIN THE MAN WHO HAS 
RULED RUSSIA FOR EIGHT YEARS TAKES 
HIS LAST STEPS AS PRESIDENT FORCED 
TO STAND DOWN BY LAW EVEN THOUGH 
HE REMAINS AT THE PEAK OF HIS 
POPULARITY BUT HE CLEARLY EXPECTS 
THAT ALL HIS POLICIES WILL BE 
CONTINUED CONTINUED IT IS IMPORTANT THAT 
WE CONTINUE ALONG THE CHOSEN 
POLITICAL COURSE 
WE HAVE A STRONG 
NATION STRONG IN SPIRIT AND WE 
HAVE OUR STRATEGY FOR THE NEXT TWENTY 
OR THIRTY YEARS HIS HAND PICK A 
SUCCESSOR DMITRY MEDVEDEV IS A 
YOUNG AND VERY LOYAL ALLY 
HE HAS 
ALREADY PLEDGED TO FOLLOW CLOSELY 
PUTIN'S PLAN FOR THE COUNTRY BUT 
AS HE WAS SWORN IN THERE WERE 
HINTS OF SOME DIFFERENT PRIORITIES 
MY MOST IMPORTANT TASK 
IS TO KEEP DEVELOPING CIVIL AND 
ECONOMIC FREEDOMS THEY ARE OF THE 
HIGHEST VALUE IN OUR SOCIETY AND WE 
MUST GET PEOPLE TO RESPECT THE LAW 
THERE IS A LOT TO BE DONE IF WE ARE 
TO BUILD AFFAIR STATE 
BUT FOR 
THESE OPPOSITION PARTIES WHICH TOOK 
TO THE STREETS ON MAYDAY IMPOSING 
THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT THE FIRST 
PRIORITY THEIR BIGGEST CONCERN IS 
THE SHARP INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF 
FOOD INFLATION LAST YEAR HIT TWELVE PER CENT 
AND NOW COULD GET MUCH WORSE THERE 
ARE ALSO BIG CHALLENGES FOR THE NEW 
PRESIDENT ABROAD RUSSIA HAS BEEN 
FLEXING ITS MUSCLES AND IN THE 
PROCESS LOSING FRIENDS RIGHT NOW 
THERE IS A MAJOR CRISIS BREWING 
WITH NEIGHBOURING GEORGIA WITH 
FEARS IT COULD EVEN LEAD TO ARMED 
CONFLICT BUT ON ALL THESE VITAL 
ISSUES DMITRY MEDVEDEV HAS SAID 
VIRTUALLY NOTHING 
RUSSIA IT SEEMS IS NOT ABOUT TO 
CHANGE COURSE JUST BECAUSE IT HAS 
CHANGED ITS PRESIDENT CRITICS OF 
THE KREMLIN SAY NO ONE SHOULD BE 
SURPRISED AT THIS IT IS THE 
BIGGEST MISTAKE TO THINK THAT WE 
HAVE A NEW SITUATION IN RUSSIA IT IT HAS PRE LOADED OR THE 
ADMINISTRATION AND WE WILL SEE IN 
THE COMING DAYS THAT WE HAVE THE 
SAME PRESIDENTIAL SITUATION WE 
HAVE THE SAME CABINET OF MINISTERS 
WE HAVE THE SAME PEOPLE THE SAME 
STUFF THE SAME LEADERSHIP THE 
SAME PEOPLE WILL STAY IN POWER 
DMITRY MEDVEDEV IS ONE OF THEM HE 
IS FROM THE HEART OF THE SYSTEM AND 
I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS ANY 
OTHER IDEAS THAN HIS COLLEAGUES 
LIKE VLADIMIR PUTIN NO SURPRISE 
THEN BUT SHORTLY AFTER TODAY'S 
CEREMONY DMITRY MEDVEDEV NOMINATED 
VLADIMIR PUTIN AS HIS PRIME 
MINISTER 
DESPITE SWITCHING ROLES MINISTER MOST RUSSIANS BELIEVE IT IS MR. 
PUTIN HE WILL REMAIN IN CHARGE OF 
THE COUNTRY WHO WILL WHEN IS 
THE ROAD END OF THE ROAD FOR 
HILLARY CLINTON 
AS HER HOPES OF WINNING THE 
DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE HAVE TAKEN A BLOW WITH BARACK 
OBAMA WINNING A CLEAR VICTORY IN 
NORTH CAROLINA AND COMING ALMOST 
NECK AND NECK WITH HER IN INDIANA 
IT TRANSPIRES THAT HER CAMPAIGN HAS 
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AND SHE HAS HAD 
TO DONATE SIX MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF HER OWN 
POCKET IN THE LAST MONTH ADDED TO 
THAT AT GEORGE MCGOVERN ANNOUNCED 
TODAY THAT HE WAS SWITCHING SIDES 
AND URGED HER TO WITHDRAW FROM THE 
RACE DESPITE ALL THIS SHE HAS 
MADE IT CLEAR SHE IS NOT READY TO 
GIVE UP THIS IS VERY PERSON OR FOR 
ME 
IT IS NOT JUST THE LITTLE BOOK ME IT IS NOT JUST PUBLIC NOT JUST 
POLITICAL I SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING 
AND WE HAVE TO REVERSE IT FOR 
EVERYONE WHO HAS STUMBLED BUT STOOD 
RIGHT BACK UP AND FOR EVERYONE 
WHO WORKS HARD AND 
NEVER GIVES UP THIS ONE IS FOR YOU 
WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD 
OF US BUT IF YOU ARE HEAVY I AM 
READY 
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU AS I HAVE 
SAID ON MANY OCCASIONS THAT NO 
MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I WILL WORK 
FOR THE NOMINEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY BECAUSE WE MUST WIN IN 
NOVEMBER 
WEST VIRGINIA IS ONE OF THOSE SO 
CALLED SWING STATES DEMOCRATS NEED 
TO WIN IT IN THE FOURTH I WANT TO 
START BY WINNING IT IN THE SPRING 
WHO WOULD YOU HIRE I HOPE NEXT 
TUESDAY WILL GIVE ME A CHANCE TO BE 
YOUR PRESIDENT THANK YOU ALL VERY 
MUCH 
NOT NECESSARILY GIVING UP YET 
JOINING ME IS THE VETERAN U. S. 
BROADCASTER TOM FENTON AND 
NEWSWEEK'S CONTRIBUTING EDITOR WHO 
HAS OBSERVED MANY BATTLES FOR THE 
WHITE HOUSE 
SHE IS NOT GOING TO GO 
UP WITHOUT A FIGHT IS SHE IF YOU 
LOOK AT THE CORE MATHEMATICS OF THE 
THING IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY STEEP 
HILL SHE HAS TO CLIMB 
IF YOU LOOK 
AT IT TWO WEEKS HENCE FROM NOW 
WITH TWO MORE PRIMARIES IT IS 
ALMOST A MATHEMATICAL IMPOSSIBILITY 
TO WIN ENOUGH OF THE PLEDGE 
DELEGATES BUT THAT HAVING BEEN 
SAID SHE IS NOT GOING TO GIVE UP 
SHE COULD CONCEIVABLY GO ON JUNE 
THIRD WHEN ALL SIX OF THE REMAINING 
PRIMARIES HAVE BEEN RUN IT IS NOT 
IN HER NATURE IS THIS BECAUSE SHE 
IS A FEMALE POLITICIAN AND WOMEN 
JUST HAVE TO FIGHT HARD 
THEY ARE 
NOT USED TO GIVING UP SO EASILY 
OUR I THINK IT IS MORE THAT SHE IS 
A CLINTON THEY HAD EIGHT YEARS IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND WITHSTOOD ALL 
KINDS OF CHALLENGES AND CRITICISM 
SHE STARTED THIS RACE AS THE FRONT 
RUNNER THERE WAS A SENSE THAT THE 
JOB OF PRESIDENT WAS CERTAINLY 
WITHIN HER REACH I THINK SHE AND 
THE PEOPLE AROUND HER STILL CANNOT 
QUITE BELIEVE THAT THIS UPSTART 
FROM ILLINOIS JUST THREE YEARS OUT 
OF THE STATE SENATE IS ACTUALLY 
BEING TAKEN ALL THAT SERIOUSLY AS 
THE POTENTIAL NOMINEE AND I THINK 
SHE IS CONVINCED THAT HE CANNOT WIN 
IN THE FALL AND SHE STILL WANTS 
TIME TO MAKE THAT CASE TO THE 
REMAINING SUPER DELEGATES WHO ARE 
THE ONES WHO HOLD THE BALANCE OF 
POWER TO THE ELECTION 
DO YOU THINK 
SHE IS BUOYED UP BY THE FACT THAT 
BILL FOUGHT AGAINST THE ODDS AND 
WON SO WHY SHOULDN'T SHE 
I THINK 
THAT IS TRUE SHE MUST HAVE IN THE 
BACK OF HER HEAD THAT THE ONLY WAY 
SHE CAN WIN IS BY DOING SERIOUS 
DAMAGE DID BARACK OBAMA IF SHE 
DOES THAT IT MAY END UP LOOKING 
LIKE A SPOILER AND IT COULD SPOIL 
HER OWN POLITICAL FUTURE SHE HAS 
NOT QUITE A POLITICAL FUTURE EVEN 
IF SHE DOES NOT MAKE IT TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE SHE COULD BE GOVERNOR 
OF NEW YORK SHE COULD BE SANITY 
MAJORITY LEADER AND SHE GOOD RUN 
FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN THE FUTURE 
IF SHE FAILS TO WIN THE MAJORITY 
HAVE PLEDGED DELEGATES AND THE 
MAJORITY OF THE POPULAR VOTE I 
THINK IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE WITH 
THESE EIGHT HUNDRED SUPER DELEGATES WHETHER 
THEY WILL GO AGAINST THE PEOPLE 
ISN'T SHE IN DANGER OF BEGINNING TO 
LOOK SELFISH THAT SHE IS CARRYING 
ON OUT OF PRIDE NOW WHEN SHE 
DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING 
SHE SAYS IT IS ABOUT THE VOTERS 
SHE SAYS THAT SHE HEARS THEIR 
GRIEVANCES AND SHE IS BEST ABLE TO 
DELIVER THE SOLUTIONS BUT WHEN IT 
BECOMES MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE 
FOR HER TO OVERTAKE BARACK OBAMA 
YOU HAVE TO ASK WHY IT IS SHE'S 
STAYING IN THIS IT SEEMS TO BE FOR 
HER OWN PERSONAL AMBITION THAT SHE 
CANNOT QUITE BRING HERSELF TO QUIT 
AS LONG AS THEY RAISED THE 
NARROWEST PART TO THE NOMINATION 
AND HEARN AND NOT MUCH THAT 
CAMPAIGN IS TALKING ABOUT FORCING 
THE SEEDING OF THE CAMPAIGNS IN 
MICHIGAN AND FLORIDA THAT HAVE BEEN 
EXCLUDED BECAUSE THEY DID NOT PLAY 
BY THE RULES BUT I THINK ABOUT 
OPTIONS WILL BE CLOSED BECAUSE THE 
REMAINING SUPER DELEGATES ARE GOING 
TO BEGIN TO COME FORWARD AND SHE 
IS GOING TO SEE THAT THERE IS NOT 
GOING TO BE ENOUGH LEFT FOR HER TO 
PERSUADE TO COME TO HER SIDE OF THE 
STORY 
EVEN AT THIS POINT SHE STORY WOULD HAVE TO GET SOMETHING LIKE 
TWO THIRDS OF THE REMAINING VOTES 
TO OVERTAKE BARACK OBAMA 
SO THE 
NUMBERS DO NOT ADD UP IT IS 
INTERESTING THAT WE HAD HER LAST 
NIGHT STARTING TO SHIFT SHE WAS 
TALKING IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH 
WHOEVER WINS WAS THAT SIGNIFICANT 
THERE IS ALWAYS THAT TALK ABOUT THE 
DREAM TICKET THE QUESTION IS WHO 
IS GOING TO BE TOP DOG THAT LET'S 
SAY THERE IS AN OBAMA CLINTON 
TICKET IT MIGHT JUST WORK IT HAS 
HAPPENED ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE WE 
HAD JOHN F. KENNEDY AND LYNDON 
JOHNSON NOT BEST BUDDIES BUT THEY 
MADE AN EFFECTIVE TICKET SHE HAS 
TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT NOT PUSHING TOO 
HARD 
CAN YOU SEE THEN KISSING AND HARD MAKING UP AFTER ALL THIS BAD BLOOD 
SEE THEM IT IS NOT ONLY IN THE 
PARTY'S INTEREST BECAUSE HE HAS TO 
PROTECT HER POLITICAL FUTURE IT IS 
UNLIKELY THAT THEY WILL END UP ON 
THE TICKET BUT SHE WANTS TO BE IN A 
POSITION WHERE SHE IS ASKED AND SHE 
MAY HAVE A PRICE FOR THEIR 
ACCOMMODATION AND THAT MIGHT HAVE 
SOME SAY OVER WHO IS NUMBER TWO ON 
THE TICKET I THINK THERE IS A 
POLITICAL DEAL TO BE STRUCK HERE 
AND THAT YOU WILL BE AMAZED AT HOW 
QUICKLY THE CLINTONS WILL LOOK LIKE 
THEY ARE THE BIGGEST ALLIES OF 
BARACK OBAMA IF THAT IS HOW IT 
SHAKES OUT 
IF YOU WERE A BETTING 
MAN HOW QUICKLY WOULD YOU EXPECT 
US TO HEAR THAT ANNOUNCEMENT 
PERHAPS AFTER JUNE THIRD AND THE LAST 
OF THE SIX PRIMARIES 
A REMINDER OF 
OUR MAIN NEWS 
FOREIGN AID IS BEGINNING TO REACH
