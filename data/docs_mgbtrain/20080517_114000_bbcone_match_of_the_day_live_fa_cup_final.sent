ABOUT THREE YEARS TO FOR GIVE ME 
BUT WE GET ON THAT NOW TO 
FORGIVE ME BUT WE GET ON NOW DO DO YOU 
HAVE TO DO EXTRA HOMEWORK I I HAVE HAD A GOOD LUCK AT CARDIFF AND 
IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE PLAYERS 
ARE NOT AS FAMILIAR AND YOU NEED 
MORE BACKGROUND 
THAT DAY 
WIMBLEDON ONE AND THEY DESERVED IT 
BUT HE SAID THAT IT WAS GOOD FOR 
FOOTBALL THAT ANNOYS ME 
WIMBLEDON ARE ONE MACRO 
WIMBLEDON WON 
MIGHT THIS BE YOUR 
LAST FINAL

I HAVE HAD A GOOD RUN AND YOUR TIME 
COMES EVENTUALLY SO I WILL TREAT IT 
LIKE THE OTHERS AND JOIN IT AND 
ENJOY IT 
HAVE A GOOD ONE FROM THE 
BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR STRANGE 
THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING ON UP 
GIANTS KILLINGS EVERYWHERE

COUNTRY DERBY DANNY STEPHEN'S FIVE 
F. T. ONE INCHES TALL SET THE TONE 
GIANT KILLERS 
STOCKPORT WERE TAKEN TO THE 
CLEANERS BY STAINES BEEN A WEE 
PLACE IN OF A REPLAY IN A 
REPLAY TRAINED KILLINGS WERE 
BECOMING THE TALK OF THE TOURNAMENT 
BUT COULD CHASETOWN DEFEAT PORT 
VALE HERE THEY NEEDED SOME 
INSPIRATION INSPIRATION FIRST TEN MINUTES LET THEM KNOW 
YOU ARE ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT WHAT 
YOU CAN DO TO GET THE EXTRA ONE PER CENT AT 
THE TIME IT SEEMED A GOOD THING TO 
SAY BUT IT PROBABLY WAS NOT THEY 
HAVE BEEN PLAYING ON PLAYSTATION IS 
ALL DAY L. WANTED TO PUT ON A GOOD 
SHOW YOU COULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN A 
BETTER SCRIPT TO HAVE A TWO PENALTY 
MISSES TO HAVE TWO FOLLOWED BY A 
SUBSTITUTE SCORING A LAST MINUTE 
GOAL I TOLD HIM I DID NOT WANT HIM 
TO PUSH UP ON AFTER I TOLD HIM TO 
HOLD HIS SHAPE BUT HE TOOK NO 
NOTICE AND THEN ATE SCORED THE 
BIGGEST GOAL IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
CLUB AND THEN HE SCORED WE WERE 
UP AGAINST CARDIFF CITY AND IT 
DAWNED ON ME AND WE COULD REALLY 
GET BEATEN THAT WE COULD THIS THIS IS A FAIRY TALE 
WE WERE DREAMING 
FOR ANOTHER IN THE FORTY FOURTH MINUTE 
THEY EQUALISED AND HOPEFULLY NOW 
THEY WILL GO ON TO WIN BECAUSE THAT 
WILL BE A GREAT HISTORY THIS WAS 
PURE MAGIC AND IT WILL BE FOREVER 
CARDIFF CITY HAVE ARRIVED THAT IS 
DAVE JONES THE MANAGER THEY ARE 
VERY EARLY TWO HOURS BEFORE KICK OFF 
THEIR PLAN TO ENJOY THEIR DAY 
I USED TO LIKE TO GET THAT AS LATE 
AS POSSIBLE WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO 
DO FOR TWO HOURS 
JIMMY FLOYD HASSELBAINK WALKING IN 
LIKE WEST BROMWICHTHEY LIKE TO PLAY 
FOOTBALL AND WE SAW WHAT WEST 
BROMWICH DID AGAINST PORTSMOUTH L. 
THINK THEY HAVE A REAL CHANCE THEY 
CAME UP BY TRAIN YESTERDAY 
WE COULD HAVE A WELSH WINNER WHICH 
WOULD PUT THEM IN THE UEFA CUP 
SPECIAL DISPENSATION 
WHY NOT IF 
YOU DESERVE YOU DESERVE TO BE FEW 
WIN THAT THE CUP 
KEVIN RATCLIFFE IS WITH RAY STUBBS 
YOU PLAYED IN FOUR F. A. CUP FINALS CAN 
THE OCCASION GET TO YOU HER HER CERTAINLY IT YOU HAVE GOT TO BE 
EXPECTING IT CERTAINLY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR 
TREVOR STEVEN'S WAS YOUNGER AND HE 
EXCELLED 
WHAT SHOULD BE A GAME EXCELLED PLAN FOR CARDIFF BAY 
THEY HAVE TO 
PLAY AT A HIGH TEMPO GET IN WITH 
PORTSMOUTH WHAT SHOULD BE IN THE 
GAME PLAN FOR CARDIFF CUT THE WAY 
OF EXPECTATION GET TO PORTSMOUTH 
HARRY REDKNAPP WILL BE NERVOUS HE 
HAS NOT WON ANYTHING AS A MANAGER 
OR PLAYER HE WILL WANT TO WIN AS 
MUCH AS ANYTHING 
WHAT SHOULD 
CARDIFF DO 
THEY HAVE GOOD QUALITY 
SET PIECES AND A FEW SURPRISES 
PORTSMOUTH WILL NOT BE USED TO 
PLAYING AGAINST PLAYERS LIKE THIS 
SO IT IS THE UNKNOWN OF WHICH IS 
SOMETIMES DANGEROUS 
DO YOU FOR 
EXPERIENCE OR PLATE YOUNG PLAYERS 
A FEW CAN EXCELTHEY SEEM TO HAVE NO 
FEAR BUT I THINK HE WILL STICK WITH 
THE TRIED AND TRUSTED NO SHOCKS 
DOES THIS BRING BACK MEMORIES 
GREAT OCCASIONS HERE ONE GREAT WIN 
AND THE OTHER THREE WERE 
DISAPPOINTING 
OUR CARDIFF GOING TO DISAPPOINTING WHEN IT 
IT WILL BE VERY CLOSE AND 
IT MIGHT EVEN GO TO EXTRA TIME BUT 
I THINK CARDIFF WILL DIRECT WILL 
DO IT 
PART TWO OF THE GIANT KILLING STORY

FIRST TO FEEL THE MR. WEEK WAS EVERY

TALKING ABOUT IT IN ANY WAY IT 
HAPPENED IT'S PART OF MY LIFE THAT 
I HAVE TO LIVE WITH WHEN THE 
MUPPETS START TO SAY THINGS THEY 
SHOULD NOT SAY BECAUSE THEY DON'T 
REALLY KNOW WHAT WENT ON L. WILL 
PUT UP WITH ALL OF THAT WHAT I AM 
INTERESTED IN IS MAKING SURE I DO 
MY JOB WELL I LOOK AFTER MY FAMILY 
WELL IF I DO THAT I HOPE THAT YOU 
GET BLESSED WITH WINNING SOMETHING 
WHAT AN EMOTIONAL DAY FOR A REAL 
FOOTBALL MAN DAVID JONES THE 
CARDIFF MANAGER CARDIFF CITY F. A. 
CUP WINNERS HOW DOES THAT SOUND 
THAT WOULD BE AN ACHIEVEMENT FOR 
THIS FOOTBALL CLUB AND MYSELF AND 
EVERYBODY ASSOCIATED IT WOULD RATE 
RIGHT UP THERE AMONGST SOMETHING 
VERY VERY SPECIAL BUT I KNOW 
HARRY AND I KNOW HIS TEAM WILL BE 
DIFFICULT IF WE PLAY TO THE BEST 
OF OUR ABILITY WE WILL GIVE THEM A 
GOOD GAME IF THEY ARE SLIGHTLY OFF 
WE SHOWED AGAINST MIDDLESBROUGH 
THAT WE CAN BEAT PREMIERSHIP CLUBS 
WE WILL BE DOING OUR DAMNEDEST TO 
DO IT AGAIN 
ALL THE BEST FOR THE 
CUP FINAL 
A PLEASURE L. REALLY 
ENJOYED THE DAY 
I HOPE YOU'RE MUCH 
MORE SUCCESSFUL AT WEMBLEY CAMERAS CAMERAS PUT ME OFF 
HE LOOKS VERY RELAXED TODAY THIS 
WAS A FEW MINUTES AGO AT WEMBLEY 
STADIUM CONDITIONS ARE SOMEWHAT 
DIFFERENT THAN THEY WERE AT CELTIC 
MANOR A LOT OF RAIN FALLING ON A 
VERY GREY WEMBLEY STADIUM WE ARE 
JOINED BY LORD KINNOCK CARDIFF 
AND NO LESS 
SIXTY ONE YEARS 
JUST SIXTY ONE YOU 
HAVE HAD LONG WAIT 
INDEED L. 
EXPECT TO BE BACK AGAIN FOR THE 
SAME KIND OF OCCASION IN THE REST 
OF MY LIFETIME 
I AM SURPRISED THAT 
YOU SUPPORT A TEAM NICKNAMED THE 
BLUEBIRDS 
THAT AND THE EUROPEAN BLUEBIRDS FLAG ARE THE ONLY BLUE THINGS IN MY 
LIFE 
WE SAW YOU AT THE SEMI FINAL LIFE VERY EXCITED A GREAT OCCASION IT IT WAS WONDERFUL BEFORE THE SEMI 
FINAL WHEN WE BEAT MIDDLESBROUGH 
WE ARE GOING TO WEMBLEY WONDERFUL 
I SAID TO DAVE AT THE TIME THIS IS 
TERRIFIC MARVELLOUS WONDERFUL OF 
COURSE IF WE GET THERE AND WE ARE 
NOW THERE THE IMPATIENCE WILL BE 
FOR WINNING THE CUP NOTHING IS 
ENOUGH WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
TOTALLY SATISFACTORY THREE OR FOUR 
WEEKS AGO IS NOW INADEQUATE IS IS YOUR WIFE HERE 
SHE IS NOT YOU YOU HAVE BANNED HER HAVEN'T YOU 
A BIT 
HARSH 
AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS HARSH THOUGHT SHE SAID LOOK THE LAST 
THREE TIMES I HAVE SEEN CITY WE 
HAVE LOST AND I COULDN'T BEAR THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF TURNING UP SO 
SHE IS WATCHING ON THE BOX SHE 
DIDN'T WANT TO COME L. SAID THAT'S 
JUST SUPERSTITION SHE SAID THIS 
FROM THE GUY WHO IS GOING TO WEAR 
THE SAME TIME THE SENSUOUS THE 
SAME SOCKS AS THE SEMI FINAL AT 
THE SAME SHOES 
RED SOCKS 
SHE IS 
PROBABLY WORRIED ABOUT YOUR 
LANGUAGE IF YOU GET BEATEN 
I JUST 
GO OFF AND BANG MY HEAD AGAINST THE 
WALL IF WE GET BEATEN L. AM A 
DEPRESSIVE LOSER 
THERE'S A 
THOUGHT 
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO THOUGHT WIN THEY ARE A BIG PHYSICAL SIDE 
VERY CAPABLE GOOD FOOTBALLING SIDE 
WE ARE SMALLER FASTER AND A LOT OF 
SKILL I THINK THAT BECAUSE WE 
HAVE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE AND 
EVERYTHING TO PROVE A COMBINATION 
OF SPEED SKILL AND THE FACT THAT 
WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY LUCK THROUGH 
THE SEASON YET 
CATT TO LET 
EXCEPT IN THE CUP MAYBE EXCEPT 
IN THE CUP MAYBE 
THIS IS A NON 
PARTISAN THING I AM TRYING TO SAY 
WE HAVE EARNED EVERY WIN L. AM NOT 
SURE AND I LOVE POMPEY AND ALL THE 
REST OF IT STANLEY MATTHEWS IN 
NINETEEN FIFTY THREE AND THE REST ABSOLUTELY WE ABSOLUTELY WE ARE HERE TO WIN TODAY 
A BIT OF 
THIS AT THE END WE HAVE SEEN YOU 
DO THAT HERE HE GOES YOU LOSE 
YOUR HAIR DOING THAT 
THAT IS HOW 
I WORE IT OUT 
IT DOES NOT ALWAYS 
PAY TO BE THE FAVOURITE AS YOU 
KNOW YOURSELF 
ABSOLUTELY IN MY 
CASE I WAS NOT THE FAVOURITE AND I 
PROVED IT WHEREAS THIS TIME WE 
ARE THE UNDERDOGS 
WHO IS THE STAR 
MAN TODAY 
JOE LEDLEY JIMMY FLOYD 
IS PLAYING L. THINK ROBBIE FOWLER 
WILL BE ON THE BENCH THAT'S 
TERRIFIC HE IS A GREAT BOOST FOR 
THE TEAM PETER WHITTINGHAM HAS GOT 
IMMENSE SKILL BUT JOE LEDLEY IS 
THE GUY WHO IS GOING TO SHINE O. K. O. K. WE WILL SEE ENJOY YOUR DAY AS MUCH 
AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN INDEED INDEED IMPOSSIBLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE WE HEARD FROM THE CARDIFF MANAGER A 
FEW MOMENTS AGO HE IS ON THE PITCH 
CAN YOU TELL US HOW THE MOOD HAS 
DEVELOPED 
FEW WE HAVE HAD A GOOD TWO DEVELOPED WEEKS ONCE THE CAMPAIGN FINISHED 
AND IT THIS WEEK IT IS TRYING TO 
MAKE SURE EVERYBODY GET THEIR SHARE 
WE HAVE HAD TRAINING HAS GONE 
WELL AND EVERYBODY IS LOOKING 
FORWARD TO IT 
YOU HAVE GOT A LOT 
OF CONFIDENCE 
WE HAVE NOT COME TO 
MAKE UP NUMBERS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE 
HAVE MADE PORTSMOUTH FAVOURITES 
BECAUSE THEY ARE THE PREMIERSHIP 
CLUB BUT WE WILL HAVE A GO AND IT 
IS NOT AS IF WE ARE PLAYING 
MANCHESTER UNITED OR CHELSEA SO WE 
THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE WAIT AND 
SEE 
WHAT IS YOUR STARTING AT A SEE LINE UP 
I CAN TELL YOU IF YOU DO LINE UP NOT TELL HOW WE READ NOT HARRY 
REDKNAPP 
SUBSTITUTES WILL BE REDKNAPP REDKNAPP PURSE TREVOR SINCLAIR AND AARON

GAME WE ARE PLAYING A QUALITY SIDE 
FROM THE PREMIERSHIP SO WE WILL 
HAVE TO BE AT OUR BEST BUT WE HAVE 
DONE IT BEFORE 
WHAT ARE YOUR 
EMOTIONS ABOUT THIS 
I HAVE NEVER 
BEEN TO AN F. A. CUP FINAL I HAVE GOT 
CLOSE A FEW TIMES BUT NOTHING WILL 
GIVE ME GREATER PLEASURE THAN 
LEADING OUT THE TEAM TODAY WHEN 
THE WHISTLE BLOWS I WILL BE DOING 
BATTLE AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A 
GOOD GAME AT A GOOD GAME WE 
HAVE BROUGHT A BIT OF ROMANCE BACK 
AND I THINK IT WILL BE GREAT 
IN A 
SEASON OF SURPRISES ONE MORE WHY WHY NOT TOTTENHAM HAVE WON THAT THE 
LEAGUE CUP IT IS NOT ALWAYS THE 
TOP FOUR IT MIGHT BE THE YEAR OF THE 
UNDERDOGS WE HAVE TO BE AT OUR 
BEST AND AS I SAID BEFORE THEY 
PERFORM TO THEIR CAPABILITIES ON 
THE DAY IT WEEK MATCH ANYBODY 
THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US 
HE GAVE US HIS LINE UP AND 
SUBSTITUTES WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE 
ROBBIE FOWLER 
APPARENTLY ROBBIE 
FOWLER SAID HE WOULD TELL HIM THAT 
IF HE WAS NOT FIT SO HE IS NOT 
DAVE JONES I THINK HE WILL BE 
SELLING TO HIS PLAYERS TO THE FACT 
THAT THEY CAN WIN TODAY PORTSMOUTH 
ARE FAVOURITES BUT THAT HAS NOT 
SAT PARTICULARLY WELL WITH THEM SO 
THE MORE YOU BUILD UP TO THIS GAME 
IT YOU ARE LOOKING AT CARDIFF AND 
THINKING THEY CAN 
ALL SORTS OF 
PEOPLE COME TO FINALS BUT WHAT 
ABOUT AUSTRALIAN CRICKET PLAYERS 
I HAVE BEEN JOINED BY LEGEND FROM 
ANOTHER SPORT FORMER AUSTRALIAN 
TEST CAPTAIN IT DOES NOT COME 
BETTER THAN THIS 
THE STADIUM IS 
FANTASTIC OR ONE OF THE GREATEST 
SPORTING EVENTS IN THE WORLD THERE THERE IS A TEST MATCH GOING ON AT LORD'S 
I PLAYED A LOT OF FOOTBALL GROWING 
UP AND WE ALWAYS USED TO WAKE UP AT 
TWO A M. AND WATCHED THE F. A. CUP IT IS 
TRADITIONAL IN AUSTRALIA WILL WILL THERE BE A BIG AUDIENCE BACK HOME 
EVEN THOUGH THE MANCHESTER UNITED'S 
OF THIS WORLD ARE NOT INVOLVED YES YES IT IS A BIG EVENTS IT IS STILL 
SPECIAL 
WE NEVER GET UP TO WATCH SPECIAL FOOTBALL AT TWO A M. 
IT IS GOOD FOR NOT 
WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG BECAUSE YOU 
NEVER NORMALLY GET TO STAY UP LATE 
SO IT'S BE IT SO IT FEELS A 
SPECIAL IT IS A BIT OF A TRADITION 
WHO DO YOU WANT TO WIN TODAY I I THINK PORTSMOUTH IF I HAD TO PICK A 
SIDE BUT I AM HERE FOR THE EVENT 
MY SON IT IS EXCITED AND IF CITIES 
FOR A GOOD GAME IT IS IRRELEVANT 
WHO WINS 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE TEST 
MATCH 
ENGLAND ARE IN A GOOD MATCH POSITION BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE MADE A 
MISTAKE LAST NIGHT YOU HAVE TO TRY 
AND GET THE RESULT AS QUICK AS YOU 
CAN BUT WE ARE WATCHING FOOTBALL 
TODAY TODAY IT IS NOT CRICKET WHETHER IT IT IS 
ALMOST SEVENTY YEARS SINCE PORTSMOUTH 
SAY THAT F. A. CUP HISTORY OUR 
REPORTER HAS BEEN TO THE SOUTH 
COAST COAST THIS IS NOT CARDIFF IT IS 
PORTSMOUTH ACE CITY OF SURPRISES 
WHATEVER AWAY FANS ARRIVING AT THE 
STATION THINK THIS IS A STADIUM 
OUR FOOTBALL CLUB AND CITY WITH 
RARE PLACE IN HISTORY AND A RARE 
BRAND OF LOYALTY PORTSMOUTH 
HARBOUR IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT 
ANCHORAGES AND HAS BEEN SO YOU 
MIGHT GUESS THAT THIS CANNOT OUR 
GREATEST NAVAL DOCKYARD HAS THE 
WORLD'S LARGEST ACTIVE DRY DOCK 
LORD NELSON EMBARKED ON HIS FINAL 
JOURNEY FROM HERE IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIVE ON HIS 
WAY TO HIS VICTORIOUS BUT FATAL 
BATTLE AT TRAFALGAR BUT DID YOU 
KNOW THAT CHARLES DICKENS IS ONE OF 
THE CITY'S MOST FAMOUS SONS OR THAT 
FRATTON PARK IS LOCATED ON AN 
ISLAND SEPARATED FROM THE 
MAINLAND YOU WOULD NEED TO HAVE 
SPENT THE LAST MONTH ON OF THE MOON 
IT NOT TO BE AWARE THAT PORTSMOUTH 
ARE IN THE F. A. CUP FINAL AGAIN 
THEIR FIRST SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AT 
MR. CHAMBERLAIN IT STILL HOPES A NEW 
EUROPE MIGHT BE BUILT WITHOUT THE 
TRAGEDY OF MACK OF MR. 
CHAMBERLAIN TRAGEDY OF WAR 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WERE AT 
WEMBLEY 
AMONG THE 
HOPEFUL SUPPORTERS WAS THIS MAN 
THE MEMORY IS FANTASTIC THE 
EXCITEMENT GREW AND I COULD NOT 
WAIT TO GET AN F. A. CUP TICKET L. GOT 
ONE FOR THE PRICE OF TWO SHILLINGS 
AND SIXPENCE A HALF A CROWN THE 
IDEA OF ISSUING TICKETS WAS NEW 
AND PLAYERS PREPARED WITH BIKE 
RIDES AND HELPING HIM OUT THE 
GROUNDS MAN AT AND HELPING OUT 
THE GROUNDS MEN 
SOME THINGS HAVE 
NOT CHANGED SIXTY NINE YEARS AGO AT THE 
KIT MANUFACTURERS DID NOT MISS A 
TRICK 
UP NORTH WE FIND PEOPLE TRICK SELLING SHIRTS FOR SOCCER FINALISTS 
AND MAYBE THIS IS THE NEAREST YOU 
WILL GET TO THE COAT OF ARMS WILL 
IT BE BLONDE OR BRUNETTE NEVER 
MIND 
ONLY THOSE INCLINED TO DREAM MIND THOUGHT THAT PORTSMOUTH COULD WIN 
IT PORTSMOUTH HAD THE WORST 
SCORING RECORD IN THE DIVISIONS MY MY TICKET SAYS SECTION THIRTEEN AND I 
THOUGHT THAT I HOPED THAT WAS NOT 
AN OMEN BUT IT WAS NOT BECAUSE 
AFTER TWENTY MINUTES WE SCORED A GOAL 
AND EVERYBODY WENT MAD THE 
IN IT 
WENT AND THAT WAS IT WE WERE ON 
THE OUR WAY 
FOLLOW HAD LEFT FOR 
PORTSMOUTH TWO MONTHS EARLIER JOCK 
ANDERSON ADDED ANOTHER AT AND AFTER 
THE BREAK THIS WAS THE MOST 
MEMORABLE GOAL THE EXPENSE OF THE 
GOALKEEPER AT THE EXPENSE BEAT BEAT GOALKEEPER PARTIALLY SAVED IT BUT 
CLIFF PARKER PUT IT IN AND LATER 
HEADED ANOTHER ONE IT WAS A 
FANTASTIC ATMOSPHERE PEOPLE COULD 
NOT BELIEVE THAT PORTSMOUTH BEAT 
WOLVERHAMPTON BECAUSE THEY WERE 
FAVOURITES WONDERFUL SOME ACT THE 
MEMORY SEIZED IN TECHNICAL ARE WHAT 
THE CAMERA CAPTURED IN BLACK AND 
WHITE 
KING GEORGE THE SIXTH WHITE PRESENTED THE CUP 
I FEEL VERY 
HAPPY BEING THE CAPTAIN OF 
PORTSMOUTH 
THE ONLY THINK I REALLY PORTSMOUTH HEARD IT WAS THE SUPPORTERS OF 
PORTSMOUTH WHEN THAT THEY TO GET 
THAT WERE SIN BINNED PLAY UP 
POMPEY PLAY UP POMPEY WHEN 
THAT THEY WERE SINKING WHEN THEY 
WERE SINGING 
THE POMPEY CHIMES 
ECHOING FROM THE GUILDHALL TO 
NEARBY FRATTON PARK HAVE BEEN THE 
ANTHEM OF THE CLUB FOR ALMOST A 
CENTURY 
IF YOU RINK POMPEY CHIMES CENTURY THAT IS PART OF OUR FOOTBALL TEAM 
AS WE SEE IT NOW BECAUSE WHEN THEY 
WILL THAT MEANS POMPEY AND WHEN 
THAT THEY WINK THE LINK 
YOU CAN 
HEAR IT FROM WHERE THEY USED TO 
PLAY 
BE GUILDHALL BELLS HAVE BEEN PLAY SILENT FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS IT 
WOULD TAKE NEARLY HALF A MILLION 
POUNDS TO REPLACE THEM A PETITION 
IS CALLING FOR THEIR RETURN THAT I I CAN REMEMBER EVER SINCE I CAME UP 
HERE AS A YOUNGSTER THEY SANK THE 
POMPEY CHIMES 
JUST WEEKS AFTER THE 
JOY OF WINNING AT WEMBLEY CAME THE 
MISERY OF WAR THE THREAT OF 
INVASION FROM THE SEA AND BOMBING 
FROM ABOVE ALMOST A TENTH OF HOMES 
IN THE CITY WERE DESTROYED FRATTON 
PARK WAS A BUILDING A YARD FOR 
DECONTAMINATION UNITS AS FOOTBALL 
UP STOPPED PORTSMOUTH BECAME THE 
ONLY CLUB TO HOLD ON TO THE TROPHY 
AS A RESULT FOR SEVEN YEARS DURING DURING THE WAR THE TROPHY WAS MOVED 
AROUND FOR SECURITY AND SAFETY 
REASONS 
IN IT WENT OUT TO A 
PUBLIC HOUSE NORTH OF PORTSMOUTH 
IN A SMALL VILLAGE IT WAS KEPT 
THAT AWAY FROM THE BOMBS IT WAS 
KEPT THERE 
THE FACT WE HELD IT FOR 
SEVEN YEARS GAVE IT THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO GO TO DIFFERENT PLACES PEOPLE 
WERE ALLOWED TO SEE IT AND GET 
THEIR HANDS ON IT THAT WAS WHAT 
KEPT PORTSMOUTH PEOPLE GOING IN IN RECENT DECADES SUCCESS HAS BEEN 
SCARCE BUT IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE F. A. CUP 
BECKONED AGAIN A SEMI FINAL 
AGAINST LIVERPOOL 
WE WERE A HUGE 
UNDERDOGS AND TO DO AS WELL AS WE 
DID AND GO TO EXTRA TIME UP WAS 
GREAT WE TOOK THE LEAD AND WE 
THOUGHT WE ARE GOING TO BEAT THEM 
DARREN ANDERTON IT IS THERE 
CELEBRATIONS WERE CUT SHORT IN 
ALMOST BY LAST MINUTE FOR THE 
LAST MINUTE IN THE LAST MINUTE 
NOT TO GET THROUGH WAS BITTERLY 
DISAPPOINTING 
AND POMPEY LOST THE DISAPPOINTING REPLAY IN THE CUP'S FIRST PENALTY 
SHOOT OUT SOME REMEMBER NINETEEN NINETY TWO SOME 
THIRTY NINE SOMETHING NEITHER BUT THEY ARE 
UNITED IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY ARE 
SPECIAL 
BEEN AN ISLAND IT MAKES SPECIAL US UNIQUE BEING AN ISLAND IT 
TAKES A WHILE BUT ONCE YOU ARE HERE

WHILE BALLOON'S CONTRIBUTED TO THE 
DOWNFALL OF MANCHESTER CITY THEY 
WERE BLOWING THEM UP AT BRISTOL 
ROVERS FOR BIRTHDAY BOY RIKKI 
LAMBERT HE CELEBRATED IN STYLE AS AS SOON AS THE FREE KICK WAS AWARDED 
RICKY LAMBERT PICKED UP THE BALL

IS GOING TO BE HIS DAY 
I FELT 
SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN L. 
CONCENTRATED ON HITTING IT AS HARD 
AS I CAN 
IT'S DEFLECTED IN 
BRISTOL ROVERS HAVE THE LEAD I I KNEW IT WAS IN STRAIGHT AWAY AND I 
JUST RAN AWAY L. KIND OF KNEW WHEN

BARNSLEY DID NOT READ THE SCRIPT A A LOT OF IT IS A HAZE YOU LOOK BACK 
AND REMEMBER THE EUPHORIA AFTER 
YOU WERE LEADING THE LINE FOR 
BARNSLEY BY RIGHTS YOU SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN IN THE PENALTY BOX WHEN 
THE BALL CAME BACK IN WHAT WERE 
YOU DOING 
I WAS CHASING THE 
REFEREE BECAUSE I FELT I HAD A 
BLATANT PENALTY THE REFEREE DID 
NOT GIVE IT IN FRONT OF THE KOP IN 
THE THIRD MINUTE BIG DECISION IN ADDED TIME 
THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON IN THAT 
SITUATION NORMALLY LOOK AT CURLING 
THE BALL INTO THE FAR CORNER JAMIE 
CARRAGHER CUT IT OFF DRILLED IT 
INTO THE NEAR CORNER AND IT CAUGHT 
OUT THE KEEPER 
HE HAS WON IT 
LIVERPOOL ARE GOING OUT OF THE F. A. 
CUP ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY MY MY MUM DAD AND BROTHER WERE AT THE 
OTHER END OF THE GROUND L. WAS 
TRYING TO GET TO THEM BUT THERE WAS 
NO CHANCE OF ME GETTING FURTHER

ME A BIT CLAUSTROPHOBIC 
STRUGGLING TO BRIEF MOBBED ME 
IN THE NEXT ROUND CHELSEA CAME OUT 
OF THE HAT 
WE HAVE A GREAT RECORD 
AT HOME WE THOUGHT O. K. ANOTHER 
GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO TEST OURSELVES 
AGAINST THE BEST BUT THERE WAS A 
SLIGHT INKLING THAT THERE WAS A 
CHANCE WE COULD CAUSE AN UPSET A A DIAGONAL CROSS KAYODE ODEJAYI 
IT'S A GOAL FOR BARNSLEY BARNSLEY 
HAVE KNOCKED THE HOLDERS CHELSEA 
OUT OF THE F. A. CUP IT WILL GOAL 
DOWN IN FOLKLORE GO DOWN YOU YOU HAVE MADE IT TO WEMBLEY CUP SEMI

TALKING OF SURPRISES RONALDO COULD 
NOT BELIEVE THIS WAS A PENALTY 
WITH THEIR GOAL PROTECTED BY A 
FORCE FIELD AND SYLVAIN DISTIN'S

TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE AND CHEER 
THEM ON HOPEFULLY THEY WILL DO THE 
BUSINESS BUSINESS INVALUABLE HIS EXPERIENCE TODAY 
YEAH A BIT OF A CURVE BALL FROM 
JONATHAN PEARCE AT THE END FAGS 
VERY MUCH FOR THAT VERY MUCH SO 
THANKS VERY MUCH AND JOE JORDAN 
THEY TAKE OVER MOST OF THE COACHING 
INTERESTING WHAT HE WAS SAYING 
ABOUT BUMPY PLAYING FOUR THREE THREE THAT 
WILL BE WHEN THEY HAVE GOT THE BALL 
POMPEY PLAYING FOUR THREE THREE THEY WERE 
OUTPLAYED IN MIDFIELD AGAINST WEST 
BROM PEOPLE LIKE TONY ADAMS AND 
JOE JORDAN GREAT FOR HARRY THE THE REWARD OF EUROPEAN FOOTBALL WOULD 
BE SUED FOR PORTSMOUTH OR BOTH 
REALLY 
ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE 
HUGE REALLY MILAN MANDARIC SOLD THE CLUB 
HOWEVER LONG AGO HE THOUGHT HE 
MIGHT GO ON TO BETTER THINGS WITH 
LEICESTER COUGHED UP WITH 
LEICESTER THEY GOT RELEGATED THE 
NEW GUY TAKES OVER AND THEY COULD 
BE IN THE UEFA CUP AND WIN THE F. A. 
CUP 
HE WAS DODGING BULLETS IN THE CUP LEBANON A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO BUT 
CARDIFF CITY FAN JEREMY BERING IS 
WITH GUY MOWBRAY 
CARDIFF CITY WHEN DID IT BEGIN 
NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT I USED TO GO DOWN WITH MY 
FATHER HE DID FOOTBALL REPORTS FOR 
THE LOCAL PAPER AND ME AND MY 
BROTHER HE IS EIGHTEEN MONTHS YOUNGER 
WE WOULD STAND IN THE END CLOSURE 
IN THE GRANGE END AT THAT TIME 
CARDIFF WERE RIDING HIGH IN 
DIVISION TWO ONE SEASON THEY 
FINISHED THIRD AND THEY USED TO DO 
PRETTY WELL IN THE EUROPEAN CUP 
WINNERS' CUP SO I THINK CARDIFF 
DOG MACRO OF MY GRANDPARENTS USED 
TO SAY THAT CARDIFF WAS MORE OF A 
FOOTBALL CITY THAN A RUGBY CITY 
AND IT HAS THE CAPACITY TO HAVE A 
BIG CLUB SO LET'S HOPE THEY BUILD 
ON THIS 
DID YOU THINK YOU WOULD 
SEE CARDIFF CITY IN AN F. A. CUP FINAL 
HERE 
NOT EXACTLY THERE ARE NINETY HERE MINUTES OF ACTION TO GET THROUGH 
FIRST I THINK THAT CARDIFF ARE 
GETTING A NEW STADIUM AND HAVE THE 
MAKINGS OF SOMETHING GOOD AND IT 
IS A BIG BARRIER WITH A LOT OF 
SUPPORT 
WINNING OF THE F. A. CUP OR SUPPORT PREMIER LEAGUE PROMOTION 
THE F. A. 
CUP OBVIOUSLY NEXT SEASON THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE 
I HAVE TO TOOK IN MONTE NOW UP CAN 
I STAY HERE L. AM LOOKING FORWARD 
TO IT HOPEFULLY AFTER LAST YEAR WE 
GET A GOOD GAME AND IF CARDIFF 
SCORE FIRST IT WILL BE VERY GOOD 
HAVE A GOOD ONE THAT ENJOY 
CARDIFF CITY ARE THE ONLY NON 
ENGLISH CLUB TO HAVE ONE OF THE CUP 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN BEST ACTOR KNOWS 
WHAT IT IS LIKE TO SUPPORT THEM 
FOR THIS ACTOR THIS ACTOR 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IT IS A FINAL 
WEEK OF THE EXPEDITION FROM ENGLAND 
CARDIFF IT IS GREAT FINAL WE 
ARE THE EXPEDITION'S 
DO YOU KNOW 
WHAT CARDIFF CITY IS ALL ABOUT THE 
COMMON MISCONCEPTION IN ENGLAND IS 
THAT WALES STANDS FOR SHEEP AND 
RUGBY UNFORTUNATELY IT IS A MYTH 
PERPETUATED BY SOME PEOPLE IN WALES 
BUT NOTHING IS FURTHER FROM THE 
TRUTH OR THOUSANDS LIKE ME GROWING 
UP IN SOUTH WALES WE WERE FOOTBALL 
SUPPORTERS IT WAS MUSIC FASHION 
END AND A BIT OF EXCESS AND A 
BIT OF MOST IMPORTANTLY A 
FOOTBALL A FOOTBALL FOOTBALL 
IT IS A STORY MIRRORED BY MOST 
FOOTBALL FANS OVER THE AGE OF THIRTY 
ACROSS SOUTH WALES IF YOU BEGAN 
WATCHING AS A CHILD IT YOUR LIFE 
WAS TRANSFORMED YOU WERE MAKING A 
STATEMENT PARTICULARLY IN SOUTH 
WALES FOOTBALL WAS MOST OBLIQUE 
WAS MOSTLY OSTRACISED BY A 
TEACHERS' THE ESTABLISHMENT THEY 
WANTED TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO 
NOTHING COULD BE SEEN TO TAKE THAT 
PRECIOUS JEWEL A WAY RUGBY IT IS 
A MYTH PERPETUATED FOR TOO LONG 
THE SIX NATIONS IS A GREAT EVENT 
BUT IT IS AN EVENT THE SPORT IS 
SUPERFLUOUS FOR SO MANY CHOOSING 
FOOTBALL YOU WERE NOT JUST 
CHOOSING A SPORT BUT A LIFESTYLE 
YOU LISTENED TO DIFFERENT MUSIC IT 
WENT TO DIFFERENT PLACES AND EVEN 
WALKED DIFFERENTLY YOU WERE 
STICKING WITH UP TWO FINGERS 
STICKING UP 
CARDIFF ONE NIL 
BEEN A PROUD WELSH 
CLUB THAT PLAYS MAINLY ENGLISH 
OPPOSITION GIVES THINGS AN EDGE 
THAT HAS NOT INGRATIATED US TO THE 
POPULACE OF THE ENGLAND AND THERE 
HAS BEEN IT THE ODD SPICY ENCOUNTER 
WITH PORTSMOUTH AND THERE HAS 
BEEN THE ODD THAT WAS AN ASPECT OF 
FOOTBALL THROUGH THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
VIOLENCE BUT THEY DID IT GROUNDS UP 
AND DOWN AT THE LAND SOUTH WALES 
IS A PRETTY HARD PLACE AND YOU WERE 
REPRESENTING YOURSELVES AND THE 
PLACE YOU CAME FROM SOME BACK EVERY 
TOWN EVERY VALLEY YOU CAME FROM 
FOOTBALL HAS THE ABILITY TO BRING 
SOUTH WALES TOGETHER LIKE NOTHING 
ELSE CAN WE ARE NOT A GLAMOUROUS 
CLUB WE ARE A MILLION MILES AWAY 
FROM THE BIG FOUR BUT I AM GLAD L. DO 
NOT UNDERSTAND THE MENTALITY OF 
PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT CLUBS MILES AWAY 
THEY GET THEIR KICKS FROM AN 
ARMCHAIR IN FRONT OF THE T. V. THEY 
WILL NEVER GET THE EXPERIENCE THAT 
I HAD THAT WAS REAL THE 
MANCHESTER UNITED FANS THREE OR A 
HIGH IS BUT THEY HAVE NEVER FELT 
BELOW US BUT THERE HAVE BEEN 
WATCHING A CARDIFF CITY WE ARE 
NEVER FAR AWAY FROM THE NEXT CRISIS 
ON THE BRINK OF ADMINISTRATION WE 
STILL HAVE A MASSIVE DEBT ONE GAME 
AT A TIME YOU JUST GET ON WITH IT 
CARDIFF CITY IN THE F. A. CUP FINAL 
IT SOUNDS BRILLIANT AND I CANNOT 
STOP IT L. USED TO WATCH THE 
BUILD UP TO THE FINAL YOU DID NOT 
HAVE TIME TO GET STRESSED L. NEVER 
THOUGHT WE WOULD BE PART OF IT BUT 
HERE WE ARE L. WOULD NOT TRADE 
THOSE TRIPS TO HALIFAX AND ROCHDALE 
FOR ANYTHING BUT THIS IS BIG TIME 
CARDIFF CITY AND THE F. A. CUP ARE 
SYNONYMOUS AND THAT WILL NOT CHANGE 
BUT WE WOULD LOVE TO WIN IT AND PUT 
THE THIRTY THOUSAND INMATES INTO THE HISTORY 
BANK AND PUT THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN 
CARDIFF LAST ONE THE YEAR BEFORE 
WAS THE GENERAL STRIKE THE SOUTH 
WALES MINERS STAYED OUT LONGER THAN 
ANYBODY ELSE THEY DEFIANTLY SANG A 
SONG WHEN THEY WENT BACK THAT IS 
STILL SONG ON THE TERRACES TODAY 
THAT IS STILL SONG THAT TSONGA 
COME ON CITY 
A BIG DAY FOR EVERYBODY I AM 
JOINED BY A OUR PANEL FIVE CUP 
WINNERS' MEDALS BETWEEN THEM I 
AM JOINED BY OUR PANEL 
I THOUGHT 
YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE THAT FOR TEN 
SECONDS 
IT IS THE PEOPLE'S FINAL SECONDS FANTASTIC THE BIG FOUR HAVE DOMINATED 
FOR SO LONG AND WE NOW HAVE CARDIFF 
AND PORTSMOUTH HE WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT THAT AT THE START OF THE 
SEASON THE COMPETITION NEEDED A 
SHOT BECAUSE OF THE DOMINATION WE 
HAD BARNSLEY WINNING AT ANFIELD AND 
THE SEMI FINAL BARNSLEY AGAINST 
CARDIFF AND WEST BROMWICH L. THINK 
FOR A PLAYER STARTING NOW DREAMING 
OF THE GLORY AND TRYING TO CONVEY 
THE IMPRESSION YOU ARE IN CONTROL 
BUT YOU'LL ON NERVOUS THE THE SUPPORTERS WILL NOT HAVE 
EXPERIENCED THIS BEFORE IT IS SO 
REFRESHING YOU CAN BET THAT UP AND 
DOWN THE COUNTRY IT YOU WILL SEE 
PLAYERS WATCHING IT AND MANAGERS 
THINKING WE COULD BE THERE BUT 
THESE TWO HAVE DONE IT THEY HAVE 
ALWAYS PUT OUT THEIR STRONGEST TEAM 
THAT SO THEY DESERVE TO BE HERE AND 
IT IS REALLY REFRESHING THESE THESE SUPPORTERS DO NOT EXPERIENCE IT AS 
OFTEN AS TEAMS LIKE ARSENAL YOU YOU CAN SENSE THAT THERE IS A GREAT 
ATMOSPHERE BUT IT IS A BIT 
DIFFERENT AS A PLAYER I LOOK 
FORWARD TO THE FIRST GAME OF THE 
SEASON AND IF YOU GET THE CHANCE 
THE F. A. CUP FINAL L. THINK IT WAS 
ALWAYS SPECIAL IN THE PASS BUT HAS 
LOST SOMETHING RECENTLY 
YOU THEY 
ARE ONLY SPECIAL IF YOU WIN THEM 
IT IS NOT JUST GREAT TO GET THERE 
IT IS ONLY GREAT IF YOU WIN IT AS AS FOR THE GAME ITSELF CARDIFF ARE 
THE UNDERDOGS THIS IS THE LINE UP 
DAVE JONES HAS GONE FOR MORE 
EXPERIENCE 
PORTSMOUTH ARE EXPERIENCE FAVOURITES BUT WE WATCHED THIS 
TEAM AGAINST MIDDLESBROUGH AND THEY 
WERE MAGNIFICENT THE TWO CENTRE 
BACKS WERE TERRIFIC YOU HAVE THE 
EXPERIENCE OF JIMMY FLOYD 
HASSELBAINK AND THEY WILL BE 
COMPETITIVE 
THEY WILL DO IT COMPETITIVE SIMILAR TO PORTSMOUTH THEY WILL 
TRY TO PLAY THE GAME OF THE WAY IT 
SHOULD BE PLAYED THEY ARE COMING 
IN WITH MORE FORMAL BAN PORTSMOUTH 
AND THAT WILL GIVE THEM A BIT OF AN 
ADVANTAGE 
I THINK FOOTBALL WILL BE ADVANTAGE PLAYED BECAUSE BOTH TEAMS LIKE TO 
PLAY I HAVE HEARD PORTSMOUTH WILL 
TRY TO OUT PLAY WILL TRY TO ADD 
UP PLAY CARDIFF BAILEY BAILEY 
THEY ARE BOTH PASSING SIDES IF 
THEY OUT POWER CARDIFF THEY SHOULD 
WIN BUT THEY STRUGGLED AGAINST WEST 
BROMWICH 
THEY ARE GOING INTO THIS BROMWICH GAME AT STRUGGLING STRUGGLING I I GOT A PREVIEW ABOUT THIS AT LAST 
NIGHT LAST NIGHT 
THEY HAVE 
STRUGGLED TO SCORE GOALS LATELY IF IF I WAS A PORTSMOUTH SUPPORTER I 
WOULD BE WORRIED YOU CANNOT JUST 
TORN JUST TURN OF FORM ON AND OFF 
THEY ARE NOT PLAYING WELL JERMAINE JERMAINE DEFOE IS NOT THERE 
AND HARRY 
REDKNAPP KNOWS THAT 
THIS IS HARRY 
REDKNAPP'S FIRST FINAL AS A MANAGER 
HIS LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE F. A. CUP 
BEGAN IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
THE F. A. CUP WAS THE ONE GAME OF THE 
YEAR THE STREETS WERE EMPTY AND NO 
ONE WOULD MISS IT THEN WE WOULD GO 
OUT AND PLAY FOOTBALL L. AM SURE 
WE HAD A NINE INCH TELEVISION WITH 
A THREE INCH MAGNIFYING GLASS 
THERE WAS ONE GAME A YEAR PROBABLY 
ON THE TELEVISION AND THAT WAS THE 
F. A. CUP FINAL TO BE GOING IN AS A 
MANAGER IS FANTASTIC 
GOING INTO THIS WEEK IT SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN A JOYOUS WEEK FOR YOU 
BUT YOU LOST FRANK LAMPARD'S MOTHER 
HOW HAVE YOU MARRIED THE TWO 
THINGS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE F. A. 
CUP FINAL AND THIS TRAGEDY 
IT IS 
NOT EASY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO CLOSE 
IT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT THING 
OBVIOUSLY SHE IS MY BIGGEST CONCERN 
IN MY LIFE SO I HAVE TO MAKE SURE 
SHE IS RIGHT AND O. K. AND SHE HAS 
BEEN PRETTY LOW OVER IT ALL BUT 
SHE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO SATURDAY 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE GAME ALONG 
WITH ALL THE FAMILY ALL THE 
GRANDCHILDREN ARE COMING AND THEY 
ARE WEARING THEIR POMPEY SHARPS IT 
IS GREAT L. KNOW WHERE THEY WILL BE 
SITTING I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO 
SEEING THEM SHIRTS 
IT WAS AT 
WEST HAM WENT THE LOVE AFFAIR WITH 
THE F. A. CUP FINAL STARTED JOHN 
BOURN WAS IN THAT SIDE THEY USED 
TO GO TO THE CAFE AROUND THE CORNER 
AND DISCUSS TACTICS USING THE SALT 
CELLARS AND THE PEPPER POT IS THAT 
WHEN YOU THOUGHT THAT IS WHAT I 
WANT TO DO 
WE USED TO GO ROUND 
THERE WE HAD TWO CENTRAL CAFES 
THE KIDS WERE GOING THE CENTRAL ONE 
THAT IS HOW I WOULD SPEND MY 
AFTERNOONS TALKING ABOUT FOOTBALL 
DRINKING ABOUT TWENTY CUPS OF TEA 
GEOFF COMING IN TO BAT NEAR POST 
GETTING ACROSS DEFENDERS THAT WAS 
NEW IN THE GAME TO THE NEAR POST 
GREENWOOD BROUGHT BACK TO WEST HAM 
AND IT WAS A GREAT PLACE TO GROW UP 
BOBBY MOORE WAS 
GREAT FRAME A GREAT FRIEND IT IS WHAT BOBBY WAS 
TELLING ME IN NINETEEN NINETY WE WERE IN 
ITALY TOGETHER AND HE WENT TO SEE 
YOU AT YOUR HOSPITAL BEDSIDE AND 
SAID YOU ARE LUCKY TO BE HERE I I WAS LUCKY L. WENT OUT TO WATCH THE 
WORLD CUP AND I WAS A VERY CLOSE 
FRIEND WITH BRIAN THREE YOUNG LADS 
IN A CAR SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE 
AND THEY ALL GOT KILLED 
UNFORTUNATELY BRIAN GOT KILLED SO 
IT WAS A PRETTY HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE 
THE FIRST THINK I KNEW WAS WAKING 
UP IN HOSPITAL SEVERAL DAYS AFTER 
THE ACCIDENT L. ALWAYS THINK ABOUT 
BRIAN BUT IT IS STRANGE L. L. THOUGHT 
I WOULD NEVER BE SUCKED INTO 
FOOTBALL AGAIN BUT I DID NOTHING 
CAN TELL YOU HOW LIKE GOT ON SUNDAY 
BEING BEATEN BY FULHAM IT IS 
RIDICULOUS TO GET AS LOW AS I CAN 
GET AFTER A GAME OF FOOTBALL WHY WHY HAS THE FORM SLIPPED AT THE END OF 
THE SEASON 
I DO NOT KNOW L. DON'T 
THINK WE HAVE PLAYED BADLY IF YOU 
TAKE IT OVER THE SEASON IT HAS 
BEEN A FANTASTIC SEASON WE 
FINISHED EIGHTH AND THAT IS WHAT WE 
ARE LOOKING TO DO GET IN THE TOP 
HALF AND KEEP PROGRESSING 
YOU HAVE 
HAD GREAT MOMENTS ALREADY 
BOURNEMOUTH AGAINST MANCHESTER 
UNITED THE LAST TEAM FROM A LOWLY 
LEAGUE TO BEAT MANCHESTER UNITED IN 
THE CUP AND WEST HAM AT MANCHESTER 
UNITED AS WELL 
YES PAOLO DI CANIO 
SCORED BUT THE DATE BY PLAYED 
THAT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE SPECIAL 
THEY WERE THE CUP HOLDERS AND THEY 
WERE A GREAT TEAM WE WERE 
STRUGGLING THIRD DIVISION TEAM AND 
WE BEAT THEM TWO TO ZERO AND IN ALL 
HONESTY WE MURDERED THEM DON'T 
ASK ME L. COULD NEVER EXPLAIN WHAT 
HAPPENED THAT DAY IT HAS GOT TO BE 
THE GREATEST DAY IN MY LIFE AND IN 
THE LIVES OF ALL THE PLAYERS IT IS 
A GREAT AFTERNOON FOR EVERYBODY AT 
BOURNEMOUTH WE ARE DELIGHTED THAT THAT MANCHESTER UNITED WIN THAT IS A 
HIGHLIGHT OF A CUP RUN YOU HAVE 
RIDDEN YOUR LUCK AT TIMES HAVEN'T 
YOU 
YES BUT I DON'T THINK WE GOT YOU THE CREDIT WE DESERVE FOR THAT WIN 
ANY TEAM THAT GOES TO OLD TRAFFORD 
AND THEY DO NOT HAVE TO RIDE THEIR 
LUCK THEY ARE DREAMING BUT WE ARE 
IN THE FINAL NOW AND WE HAVE GOT A 
GREAT CHANCE 
IS THAT THE MOST 
SATISFYING THING YOU HAVE DONE GET 
THEM TO WEMBLEY OR GET THEM INTO 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
GETTING THEM 
INTO THE PREMIER LEAGUE FOR ME WAS 
FANTASTIC TO TAKE THE CLUB OVER 
WHICH HAD BEEN IN THE BOTTOM FOUR 
FOR FIVE YEARS RUNNING I DIDN'T 
SEE ANY FUTURE IN TAKING THIS CLUB 
AT THAT TIME I THOUGHT THERE WAS 
NOWHERE I COULD TAKE MILAN 
CONVINCED ME TO GIVE IT A GO AND IN 
THE FIRST YEAR WE CAME AND WE 
WALKED AWAY WITH THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
THAT WOULD TAKE SOME BEATING HERE HERE YOU ARE IN AN F. A. CUP FINAL AN OLD 
FASHIONED TYPE OF F. A. CUP FINAL I I THINK IT IS GOOD FOR THE FANS 
PEOPLE GET BLASE EVERY YEAR 
CHELSEA MANCHESTER UNITED ARSENAL 
LIVERPOOL SO WHAT THEY WENT THERE 
THE YEAR BEFORE THE YEAR BEFORE 
IT IS NO BIG DEAL BUT FOR OUR FANS 
IT IS SPECIAL BUT WHAT I WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
BOTH SETS OF FANS STAY AT THE END 
OF 
THE DAY L. FIND IT STRANGE THAT THE GAME ENDS AND ONE HALF GET OUT 
OF THE STADIUM AS IF THEY CANNOT 
BEAR TO SEE THE OTHER TEAM GET THE 
CUP WHEN I GREW UP THE GAME WOULD 
FINISH BOTH TEAMS WILL PROBABLY DO 
A LAP OF HONOUR COLOUR AND THE FANS 
WOULD STAND L. DON'T KNOW MAYBE IT 
IS INDICATIVE OF LIFE AND SOCIETY 
AT THE MOMENT 
WHEN YOU LEAD THE 
TEAM OUT WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE 
GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND THE 
ROMANCE OF IT ALL OR HANG ON A 
MINUTE THIS IS NINETY MINUTES WE HAVE 
GOT SOMETHING TO WIN 
NO I WILL BE 
CONCENTRATING ON THE GAME AND 
TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE WIN THE CUP 
BUT WANT TO GO AWAY ON HOLIDAY WITH 
SANDRA IN THE SUMMER AND HAVING 
WON THE CUP THAT WOULD BE 
FANTASTIC IT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT 
YEAR IN ALL HONESTY BUT THAT WOULD 
GIVE US ALL A BIG LIFT 
HE HAS HAD QUITE A 
SEASON IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE IT IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH SEASON FOR HIM 
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE ESCAPADE WITH 
THE POLICE RAIDING HIS HOUSE HE 
WAS ON THE VERGE OF JOINING 
NEWCASTLE AT ONE STAGE HE MUST 
LOOK BACK OF THE SEASON AND THINK 
IT HAS BEEN A REMARKABLE SEASON 
WHAT A WAY IT WOULD BE TO ENDED 
WITH THE F. A. CUP IT HAS BEEN A 
TOUGH TIME FOR HIM BUT HE DESERVES 
IT IF YOU GO AROUND THE WORLD OF 
FOOTBALL EVERYONE SPEAKS VERY 
HIGHLY OF HARRY PARTICULARLY THE 
PLAYERS WHO HAVE PLAYED UNDER HIM 
THAT IS WHY HE GETS THE BEST OUT OF 
THE OLDER PLAYERS HE TAKES THEM ON 
SOME FUNDS WITH A GAMBLE OR A 
CHANCE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THEY 
PERFORM FOR HIM 
HE HAS DONE A 
TERRIFIC JOB 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GET WHAT YOU 
DESERVE EVRA WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM 
PICK THE TROPHY UP EVERYONE 
WOULD IF HE IS A BIT NERVOUS AND 
CERTAINLY HIS SON IS JAMIE IS IN 
PIECES EXT IN PIECES L. DON'T 
THINK YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER 
DRESSING ROOM THAN THAT PEOPLE 
FORGET ABOUT JOE JORDAN TO HAVE 
THAT DRESSING ROOM IN THERE AND 
DOOLEY THOSE PLAYERS UP THEY HAVE 
BEEN GIVEN THE BEST POSSIBLE CHANCE 
HE HAS SHOWN WHAT A VALUABLE 
MANAGER HE IS AT WEST HAM HE HAD 
YOUNG TALENT LAMPARD JOE COLE 
THERE IS ONE HUNDRED MILLION NOW HE HAS 
GOT THE OLDER TALENT AND GOT THE 
BEST OUT OF THEM JAMES SOL 
CAMPBELL ITS SYLVAIN DISTIN KANU 
WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT WHERE HE IS 
NOW AND IT IS LIKE NIGHT AND DAY 
THE FANS ARE DRIFTING INTO THE 
STADIUM NOW OF ALL DIFFERENT SORTS 
OF AGES SHE IS GOING TO ENJOY IT 
I WONDER IF SHE PLAYED DOES HE 
SNEAKER IN UNDER HIS COAT WONDER 
IF SHE WILL REMEMBER IT IN YEARS TO 
COME SNEAK HER WHEN JIMMY FLOYD 
HASSELBAINK JOINED CARDIFF HE 
PROBABLY THOUGHT HIS CHANCES OF 
GETTING WINNER'S MEDAL WAS GONE 
IF SOMEONE HAD SAID TO YOU AT THE 
START OF YEAR THAT NEXT YEAR YOU 
WOULD BE ABOARD YACHT LOOKING 
FORWARD TO CUP FINAL WOULD YOU 
HAVE BELIEVED IT 
I WOULD HAVE SAID 
IF THAT HAPPENS I WOULD JUMP OFF 
THE BOAT AND GO FOR A SWIM BUT I 
AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT 
IT HAS 
BEEN QUITE A YEAR 
IT HAS BEEN A 
MAGNIFICENT YEAR IT WAS AMAZING L. 
THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN DOING A 
LITTLE BIT BETTER IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP ITSELF BUT YOU KNOW 
TO HAVE THIS F. A. CUP RUN AND GO TO 
THE FINAL AND HAVING A CHANCE AS 
WELL 
THAT IS THE POINT YOU'RE NOT WELL GOING THERE TO MAKE UP THE NUMBERS 
THIS IS A REAL CHANCE TO WIN IT 
AGAIN 
I THINK WE HAVE GOT ENOUGH AGAIN CHARACTERS IN OUR TEAM TO BE ABLE 
TO DELIVER ON THE DAY 
WHO MAKES YOUR TEAMS TICK 
I MUST 
SAY WE HAVE GOT SOME GOOD 
FOOTBALLERS LIKE STEPHEN MCPHAIL 
WHITTINGHAM WHITTINGHAM 
AND AARON WHITTINGHAM WHITTINGHAM RAMSEY WHO IS ONLY SEVENTEEN IT IS SO 
EASY FOR HIM HE WILL MAKE IT 
SEVERAL CLUBS ALREADY NOW ARE 
LOOKING AT HIM IN TRAINING HE 
STANDS OUT FROM A LOT OF OTHER 
PLAYERS HE IS A GOOD FOOTBALLER 
THEY ARE SHOWING OFF I'M NOT 
ALLOWED TO GO THAT FAST 
YOU ARE DARE I SAY IT THE ELDER 
STATESMAN NOW YOU ARE PLAYING A 
MORE RESPONSIBLE ROLE ARE YOU 
ENJOYING THAT 
YEAH I MUST SAY I 
AM A MORE RESPONSIBLE THAN A FEW 
YEARS AGO BUT YOU KNOW THE GAME 
HAS CHANGED SO MUCH I AM MORE 
RESPONSIBLE YOU CANNOT SAY TOO 
MUCH TO YOUNGSTERS AT THIS TIME 
SOME OF THEM YOU JUST NEED TO LET 
THEM GO AND DO THEIR OWN THING LET 
THEM MAKE THEIR OWN MISTAKES WHAT WHAT ABOUT THIS A CUP FINAL BUSINESS 
YOU HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE YOU 
HAVE BEEN IRONICALLY TO CARDIFF 
OF COURSE 
JUST DOWN THE ROAD L. 
HAD A FITNESS TEST AT NINIAN PARK 
IT WAS ON THE DAY OF THE GAME WE 
STAYED WITH CHELSEA IN THE HOTEL 
WE LOST TWO TO ZERO PAOLO DI CANIO SCORED 
A MAGNIFICENT GOAL YOU WIN SOME 
YOU LOSE SOME HOPEFULLY IT IS OUR 
TURN 
IT IS IRONIC ISN'T IT THAT TURN ALL THESE YEARS THE CUP HAS BEEN 
COMING TO CARDIFF AND NOW THEY ARE 
GOING TO WEMBLEY IT IS 
EXTRAORDINARY THAT IT SHOULD HAPPEN 
THIS WAY WHAT HAS THE RESPONSE OF 
THE CARDIFF PEOPLE BEEN 
IT IS 
AMAZING JUST BEFORE THE SEMI FINAL 
FROM WHEN WE PLAYED MIDDLESBROUGH 
WE HAD SO MUCH SO GOOD SUPPORT 
GOING TO THE GAME AT MIDDLESBROUGH 
THE TICKET FOR THE SEMI FINAL WERE 
SOLD LIKE THAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE 
AT WEMBLEY WAS JUST AMAZING THIS THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY END A CLOSING 
CHAPTER IF YOU LIKE ALTHOUGH 
THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE TO 
COME YOU COULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINED 
SURELY THAT YOU ARE STILL HAVE 
THIS UP YOUR SLEEVE IN THE CAREER 
COULD YOU NO ESPECIALLY NOT WITH 
CARDIFF THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT EVEN 
MORE SPECIAL IT IS AN AMAZING 
FEELING I DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT 
AWAY 
IVAN GASKELL GETTING 
HIS HANDS ON JIMMY FLOYD 
HASSELBAINK'S BIG STEERING WHEEL A 
BIG GAME PLAN AND A BIG PLAYER FOR 
CARDIFF TODAY 
HE HAS GOT THE 
EXPERIENCE BUT OBVIOUSLY THE 
QUALITY IN THE FINAL THIRD OF THE 
PITCH HE HAS GOT IT HE HAS BEEN 
THERE SEEN IT DONE IT PROVEN 
QUALITY A GREAT GOALSCORER ALAN 
SHEARER WILL TALK US THROUGH THIS 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT HIM IS WHETHER 
IT IS LEFT FOOT OR RIGHT FOOT IT 
IS ALL ABOUT POWER WHETHER IT IS 
THE FRONT OF THE VOTE OR THE SIDE 
FOR IT WE ARE SEEING EVERYTHING 
HERE WHICH IS YOUR POWER L. LOVE THAT 
THAT WAS POWER 
HE IS HITTING THAT THE TARGET IT IS IF YOU ARE GOING 
TO LET HIM SHOOT FROM THIS DISTANCE 
THEN UNAFRAID STILL AT THIRTY SIX HE IS 
ABLE TO DO THAT L. AM NOT SURE HE 
WILL GET THE ROOM THERE THIS IS 
THE BEST ONE FOR ME HE LET IT RUN 
ON A LEFT FOOT ALTHOUGH THE INSIDE 
OF THE THIRD IT IS TREMENDOUS 
POWER IN THERE IF HE GETS WITHIN 
TWENTY YARDS OF THE GOAL DAVID JAMES 
WILL KNOW ABOUT IT 
HE HAS GOT LOTS 
OF PACE BUT HE HAS STILL GOT A 
LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT THAT CAN SET 
HIM APART 
THE THING IS WITH HIM 
IN A YOUNG TEAM AS WELL WHEN 
THINGS ARE GOING WELL A YOUNG TEAM 
PLAYS ABOUT FEAR BUT IF THEY GO ONE 
ZERO DOWN TODAY THEY LOOK FOR PEOPLE 
RUN HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE HE WILL 
BE INVALUABLE IN THERE ARE TIMES OF 
THE GAME PORTSMOUTH WILL HAVE THE 
BALL BUT A LOT SO THEY LOOK TO HIM 
TO HOLD THE BALL UP 
YOU DID THAT 
WITH TONY ADAMS 
SOME OF US HAVE 
FRIENDS WITH THIS GAME 
FROM ONE 
VETERAN TO ANOTHER AND THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD 
DAVID JAMES SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT 
THE PORTSMOUTH GOALKEEPER HAS BEEN 
IN THE BEST FORM OF HIS CAREER 
A SPECIAL PLACE PORTSMOUTH SO SO MUCH HERITAGE FOUGHT A CLUB THAT 
HAS NOT WON GREAT DEAL IN 
FOOTBALL GETTING INTO CUP FINAL 
IS HONOURABLE WE ARE REPRESENTING 
PORTSMOUTH AS A CITY PORTSMOUTH IS 
ON AN ISLAND DOES THAT HAVE AN 
AFFECT ON SUPPORTERS THEY DO SEEM 
PARTICULARLY PASSIONATE 
BE A DO 
IT IS TRADITIONAL FOR SUPPORTERS TO 
GET IN A FRENZY BUT FROM THE SEMI 
FINAL ONWARDS IT HAS BEEN MADNESS 
YOU HAVE PLAYED IN A COUPLE OF F. A. 
CUP FINALS AND LOST TWICE IS THAT 
UNFINISHED BUSINESS A YES I AM 
NOT LOOKING TO GET REVENGE 
YES 
WE JUST HAVE A SITUATION WHERE 
PORTSMOUTH ARE FAVOURITES TO WIN OF 
AND THEN WE ARE CAPABLE OF BEATING 
THE BEST ON A OUR DAY HER AND 
GETTING HERE WE HAVE BEATEN THE 
BEST TEAM IN THE COUNTRY 
MANCHESTER UNITED IT IS NOT ABOUT 
DAVID JAMES LOSING TWO PREVIOUS CUP 
FINALS 
THE MEN IN THE WHITE SUITS FINALS ARE HERE 
NINETEEN NINETY SIX MEMORABLE SUITS 
AND THEY WERE GREAT FOR THEY 
WERE A GREAT THE GAME IS 
REMEMBERED MORE ABOUT THE SUIT THAN 
THE PERFORMANCE IF WE HAD ONE WE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST ADDRESSED 
TEAM TO HAVE ONE OF THE CUP FINAL 
DID YOU DESIGN THEM TO HAVE WON 
THE CUP FINAL 
I HAD A SAY BUT 
HANDED OVER THE DECISION TO 
SOMEBODY MORE ACCURATE L. STILL 
HAVE THE SUIT IT HAS GRASS ON IT 
DOES IT STILL FIT PROBABLY STAN PROBABLY STAN COLLYMORE'S DOES NOT 
I AM SURE IT 
DOES NOT FIT JOHN BARNES EITHER 
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT HAIR PEOPLE 
WILL REMEMBER YOU FOR HAIRCUTS 
SUITS AND HAIR CUT BUT WHAT A 
CAREER WHAT A CAREER L. GET 
BORED SOMETIMES AND CHANGE IT MY 
FAVOURITE WAS THE SUPERMAN HAIR CUT 
I HAD TO DO IT IN THE MORNING 
BECAUSE IT WAS SPIKY I DID NOT 
WANT TO GO OUT LOOKING LIKE A TEN 
YEAR OLD SO I COME DEBT 
YOU HAVE 
AN AFRO AT THE MOMENT MICHAEL OWEN 
IT SAID ITS GOT HIM SCORING THE 
OTHER WEEK IF IT SAID SAID IT 
STOP HIM SCORING IT STOPPED HIM 
ARE YOU SUPERSTITIOUS ABOUT HAVING 
IT ON ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER MOST 
GOALKEEPERS ARE SUPERSTITIOUS L. 
WAS DEBATING IT TODAY AND SOMEBODY 
SAID IT WAS BAD LUCK IF I CHANGED 
IT TODAY BUT I AM NOT 
SUPERSTITIOUS I WANT TO SHAVE IT 
TOMORROW I WILL DO 
THE FINAL 
SECONDS OF STOPPAGE TIME HARRY HARRY REDKNAPP SAYS YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED 
WELL IN THE F. A. CUP 
AWFUL AS FAR 
AS PERFORMANCES GO WE HAVE NOT 
BEEN GREAT BUT WE HAVE BEEN 
PLAYING CHAMPIONSHIP SIDES APART 
FROM MANCHESTER UNITED L. HOPE THIS 
BECOMES A NICE VICTORY S. VICTORY 
THIS IS DAVID JAMES ARE WARMING UP 
IT IS HIS THIRD CUP FINAL THIS 
IS DAVID JAMES WARMING UP 
HE HAS 
HAD AN UNBELIEVABLE SEASON HE WAS 
NAMED IN THE TEAM OF THE YEAR ONE 
OF THE REASONS THE TEAM IS HERE 
TODAY 
HE CONVEYS SO MUCH TODAY CONFIDENCE IN HIS EARLY CAREER HE 
MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES WITH HIS 
JUDGMENT YOU HAD ONE IN TEN WHEN HE 
MISJUDGED BUT NOW IT IS ABOUT ONE 
IN TWENTY HE HAS HAD A TREMENDOUS 
SEASON AND I THINK HE IS ONE OF THE 
BEST GOALKEEPERS IN THE COUNTRY HE HE IS A CALMING INFLUENCE AND HE 
DESERVES ANOTHER CHANCE AT A CUP 
FINAL THIS SEASON HE HAS THE 
SEASON HE 
HAS HAD HE MIGHT WIN HE HE HAS KEPT PORTSMOUTH IN THE 
COMPETITION THAT IS A TOP PENALTY 
SAVED 
THAT WAS VITAL 
YOU WONDER SAVED IF HE GOT A SAVED NOT SURE AT THE 
TIME BUT WHEN YOU SEE IT FROM 
BEHIND COMIC HE GOT A GREAT TOUCH 
A SAVED THEY WENT THROUGH AT OLD 
TRAFFORD HE HAS MADE TWO MISTAKES IN 
TWO CUP FINALS 
DO THOSE THINGS LIVE 
IN A PLAYER'S MEMORY 
WITHOUT DOUBT 
THAT IS THE MENTALITY OF DEFENDER 
YOU WILL REMEMBER IT SO HE WILL BE 
THINKING ABOUT THAT THE FIRST ONE 
THAT WAS NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND HE WAS USED TO 
MAKING THAT TYPE OF MISTAKE L. 
THINK HE IS LOT BETTER NOW DO DO YOU REMEMBER THAT MISTAKE AGAINST 
WIMBLEDON 
IT WASN'T ME WAS IT ME WIMBLEDON I REMEMBER THEIR EIGHT TO SIX CUP FINAL 
THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX CUP FINAL 
THIS IS STRIKER 
STEVE THOMPSON 
KEVIN MCNAUGHTON AND I STARTED 
WRITING A SONG WE HAD HAD TWO 
BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE AND WERE 
DRINKING WINE AT AND WERE 
DRINKING WINE AT 
WHO PETER IS A 
GREAT GUY AND A GREAT GOALKEEPER 
PETER HIS HAIR CUT LEAVES A LOT TO 
BE DESIRED IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS 
ESCAPED FROM A FINNISH MONASTERY 
THE GREY SQUIRREL HAS HAD A 
FANTASTIC SEASON HE HAS BEEN THE 
MOST CAN SO HE HAS HAD THE MOST 
CONSISTENT SEASON HE IS THE 
COMEDIAN AT THE CLUB L. SAID TO 
TONY AND I WOULD GO EASY ON HIM BUT 
HE PHONED ME THE OTHER EVENING AND 
LEFT ME A MESSAGE HE IS NOT THE 
FASTEST PLAYER BUT HE SEEMED TO BE 
WINNING THE SPRINT TEST IT WAS 
BECAUSE HIS NOSE WAS CROSSING THE 
LINE ABOUT A METRE BEFORE EVERYBODY 
ELSE ROGER UP LOVES HIMSELF HE 
WAS CHOCOLATE HE WOULD EAT HIMSELF 
HE THINKS HE IS THE BEST AT 
EVERYTHING IT IS JUST A SHAME HE 
HAS A TWENTY FOUR INCH WAIST GLEN IS A BIT 
OF A POSER HE IS MY ROOM AT MAKE 
HE IS PERFECT BECAUSE WE DO NOT 
REALLY LISTEN TO EACH OTHER HE 
LISTENS TO D. V. D. S. IN DUTCH IT IS 
LIKE HAVING YOUR OUR OWN ROOM AT 
PETER IS THE MOST LAID BACK PERSON 
ON THE PLANET THE FITNESS COACH IS 
ALWAYS TRYING TO GET HIM TO DO 
THINGS AND HE IS NOT BOTHERED 
TECHNICALLY THAT I WOULD SAY HE IS 
THE BLESSED PLAYER AT THE CLUB 
THE BEST PLAYER HIS NICKNAME IS 
THE HONEY MONSTER GAVIN HAS HAD A 
FANTASTIC SEASON HE IS A GENUINE 
AND NICE GUY STEPHEN IS THE BEST 
DRESSED PLAYER HE IS ALWAYS WELL 
TURNED OUT IT IS A SHAME HE HAS A 
WOODEN RIGHT LEG JOKE IS THE HERO 
AT THE MOMENT AFTER GETTING THE 
GOAL IN THE SEMI FINAL THAT IS 
FITTING BEING A LOCAL BOY IT HE 
PRONOUNCES THE LATTER ARE AS W. HE 
WAS ASKING DOG MACRO PAUL HAS HAD 
ANOTHER GREAT SEASON HE HAS DONE 
WELL AS AN EMERGENCY STRIKER IT IS 
A SHAME HE MISSED THE SEMI FINAL 
THROUGH INJURIES BUT HE WILL GET 
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AND I AM SURE 
HE WILL GRAB THAT JIMMY FLOYD 
IN THE BANK HE HAS BEEN GREAT AT 
THE CLUB IT IS FANTASTIC TO WORK 
WITH PEOPLE LIKE THAT I DO NOT 
THINK HE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO 
HAVE PLAYED AS MANY GAMES THIS 
SEASON 
NOT RECORDING RECORDS AND BEING A 
ROCK STAR BUT I TRIED TO BE A 
FOOTBALLER I TRIED TO BE I 
TRY IT TO BE 
BRITAIN HAS GOT TALENT BUT HE HAS 
BEEN LEFT ON THE BENCH TODAY BEST BEST SINKING EVER BEST CUP FINAL SONG 
EVER EVER AS FOR PORTSMOUTH THIS IS POMPEY'S 
ASSISTANT MANAGER AND VERY GOOD 
FRIEND OF LEE DIXON TONY ADAMS 
THE WHERE IS YOUR MAN WHERE IS 
WE WILL GET HIM IN AND MINUTE WHAT 
ABOUT CARDIFF AND THEIR DEFENCE 
THEY ARE GOOD AT PASSING AND 
PLAYING BUT AGAINST MIDDLESBROUGH 
AT THEIR DEFENCE WAS FANTASTIC THE 
TWO CENTRE BACKS COMPLEMENT EACH 
OTHER BOTH GREAT IN THE AIR 
JOHNSON CAUGHT MY EYE HE WAS GOOD 
ON THE GROUND AS WELL HE LOVES TO 
TACKLE HE TAKES NO PRISONERS HE 
THREW EVERYTHING AT THE BALL IN 
THIS GAME HE READS THE GAME WELL 
AND HE IS STRONG IF THEY WILL BE 
NEEDED IN THE AIR OR NOT BECAUSE 
PORTSMOUTH PLAY ON THE GROUND IT 
THEY WILL HAVE TO SORT THAT OUT 
THEY ARE A PARTNERSHIP THEY WILL 
NEED TO COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER TODAY 
THEY HAVE SCORED A TERRIFIC GOALS 
IN THE SEASON 
TERRIFIC GOALS IF 
WEST BROMWICH HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO 
THAT LIKE CARDIFF THE SEMI FINAL 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT KEVIN 
MCNAUGHTON A FANTASTIC STRIKE IF 
THEY ARE TO BE GIVEN CHANCES TODAY 
I THINK THEY WILL TAKE THEM THEY 
HAVE PROVED THAT OVER THE YEAR 
JIMMY FLOYD HASSELBAINK OR WE WILL 
NEVER GET TIRED OF THAT WHAT A 
GREAT FINISH WE WILL NEVER AND 
THIS AGAIN THAT AND THIS AGAIN 
SOME ACT A GOOD FINISH THIS COULD 
BE A THREAT THAT IS WHAT GOT THEM 
THROUGH 
IF THEY CAN REPLICATE THAT THROUGH PERFORMANCE THEY CAN WIN THIS GAME 
AT THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
BOTH TEAMS ARE OUT AT THE MOMENT 
AND THE MANAGERS ARE TALKING TO 
EACH OTHER THEY SEEM IT VERY 
RELAXED I DOUBT THEY WILL BE 
DISCUSSING TACTICS AT THIS STAGE 
BOTH GREAT MEN DAVE JONES IS A 
GREAT FOOTBALL MANAGER 
LEE DIXON 
HAS BEEN ON THE PHONE TO HIS FRIEND 
AND HE IS READY 
DAVID JAMES GOALKEEPER 
THE SUPER 
FIT THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD TWO CLEAN SHEETS 
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF GOT BACK INTO 
THE ENGLAND TEAM WELL DESERVED 
SOL CAMPBELL DEFENDER 
HE IS 
ENJOYING HIS FOOTBALL AND HIS LIFE 
THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR HIM HIS 
EXPERIENCE IS INVALUABLE TO EVERY 
MEMBER OF THE SQUAD THEY ALL LOOK 
TO HIM AND IF HE IS HAVING A GOOD 
DAY EVERYONE IS 
SYLVAIN DISTIN 
DEFENDER 
A FREE TRANSFER HARRY DEFENDER WEAVED HIS MAGIC HE WAS FANTASTIC 
LAST SEASON BUT WE HAVE ADDED A 
LITTLE BIT OF PACE HE HAS ALSO 
CONTRIBUTED TO THE OH TWO CLEAN SHEETS 
GLEN JOHNSON DEFENDER 
HE NEEDED 
TO BE LOVED OWN THINK JOSE 
MOURINHO DID AT CHELSEA IT HAPPENS 
I HAVE BEEN IN THAT SITUATION AS 
WELL DON'T FORGET HE IS A BABY 
WE HAD TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF WORK 
WITH HIM DEFENSIVELY BUT HE HAS 
BEEN EXCEPTIONAL FOR US THIS SEASON 
PAN FRIED A SON DEFENDER HIS HIS ATTITUDE IS MAGNIFICENT 
HERMANN 
HREIDARSSON 
HIS ATTITUDE IS HREIDARSSON FANTASTIC HE IS FIRST ON THE 
TRAINING PITCH THE LAST ONE TO GO 
HOME 
LAZARD DIARRA MIDFIELDER HOME HOPEFULLY WE CAN KEEP HIM FOR A FEW 
MORE YEARS BUT I THINK HE IS A TOP 
PLAYER HE IS VERY TENACIOUS A 
VERY INTELLIGENT PLAYER THERE ARE 
COMPARISONS WITH OTHER GREAT 
PLAYERS UNFORTUNATELY WE MIGHT 
LOSE HIM 
PEDRO MENDES MIDFIELDER 
HE IS A FOOTBALLER INTELLIGENT 
PASSES THE BALL KEEPS THE BALL HE 
IS YOUR ENGINE HE IS FANTASTIC 
FOOTBALLER I LIKE WATCHING HIM 
TRAIN HE IS MY KIND OF PLAYER 
JOHN UTAKA MIDFIELDER 
HE HAS GOT 
PACE I HAVE SEEN HIM PLAY IN THE 
MIDDLE I HAVE SEEN HIM PLAY WIDE 
HE HAS GOT IT ALL 
SULLEY MUNTARI 
MIDFIELDER 
IT IS HIS FIRST YEAR IN MIDFIELDER THE PREMIERSHIP WE HAVE HAD TO GET 
ON TO HIM TO REALISE THAT THE 
PREMIERSHIP IS A VERY PACY GAME HE 
HAS ADAPTED WELL A COUPLE OF 
FANTASTIC GOALS COME TO MIND NIKO NIKO KRANJCAR MIDFIELDER 
FOR ME HE IS 
THE PLAYER OF THE YEAR L. THINK 
WHAT WE HAVE PUT INTO HIM THIS 
SEASON IS HIS WORK RATE WE ALL 
KNEW HIS TALENT GOING FORWARD HE 
CAN OPEN UP DOORS FOR YOU A BIG 
TALENT BUT THIS SEASON HE HAS 
ADDED A DEFENSIVE SIDE TO THE 
FORWARD KIND OF THINGS HE HAS 
IMPROVED DEFENSIVELY 
KANU STRIKER 
WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT KANU L. LOVE 
HIM HE HAS BEEN SO IMPORTANT TO US 
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS HE HAS MADE 
THE TEAM TICK FOR ONE SO TALL HE 
HAS GOT AN AMAZING TOUCH AND 
BRINGS OTHER PEOPLE INTO PLAY HE 
IS A REMARKABLE PLAYER 
THERE IS A MAN WITH 
BAGS OF EXPERIENCE HE IS USED TO 
CUT VINYLS BIG EVENTS 
AND ONE OF 
THE GREAT CENTRE BACKS FOR THE LAST 
THIRTY YEARS CUP FINALS L. THINK 
HARRY HAS KEPT HIM GOING AND GOT 
THE BEST OUT OF HIM THIS SEASON HE 
HAS BEEN MAGNIFICENT AS USUAL VERY 
CONSISTENT THIS IS AGAINST DIDIER 
DROGBA THE TACKLE WAS TIMED TO 
PERFECTION THEY 
PERFECTION THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT PERFECTION BE FINISHED IN HIS LAST YEAR AT 
ARSENAL 
HE HAD PROBLEMS ON AND OFF ARSENAL THE PITCH BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO 
REMEMBER AGAIN THE TIME OF THE 
TACKLE IS EVERYTHING AS FERNANDO 
TORRES COMES ACROSS NO ROOM FOR 
RALPH NO ROOM FOR ERROR HE COMES 
TO THE NEXT ONE A BIT SQUARE TO 
THE TARGET BUT A GREAT BLOCK WHAT 
ABOUT THIS FOR A CLEARANCE IN THE 
CUP THIS IS ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT 
GREAT POSITION AND THEN JUST FIX 
IT AWAY AND A GREAT PARTNERSHIP 
WITH DISDAIN AS WELL 
YOU TALK 
ABOUT THE END OF HIS CAREER AT 
ARSENAL DISTIN 
MENTALLY IF YOU 
ARE NOT BRIGHT PLAYING AT THAT 
LEVEL YOU HAVE NO CHANCE HARRY 
HAS TO LOOK AFTER HIM AND HE KNOWS 
TONY ADAMS AND HE IS NOW PLAYING 
AT HIS BEST 
PLAY IN FIVE OR SIX 
YEARS WITH YOU WOULD TAKE ITS TOLL 
HE HAS BEEN OUT FOR THE LAST THREE 
OR FOUR WEEKS SO LET'S SEE IF HE 
IS FIT FOR THE FIRST TEN MINUTES IN IN RECENT SEASONS IT HAS BEEN MORE 
CORPORATE THAN ANYTHING THE F. A. CUP 
FINAL BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE 
BIT SPECIAL THIS YEAR IT IS 
JUMPING INSIDE THE STADIUM THE THE ATMOSPHERE IS SENSATIONAL AND IT IS 
GREAT TO SEE BOTH SETS OF 
SUPPORTERS ARE REALLY GOING TO 
ENJOY THIS LIKE YOU SAY IT IS 
JUMPING TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE KICK OFF 
A WONDERFUL TO SEE IT 
ALL THE BIG 
BOYS TAKE IT FOR GRANTED WHAT A 
GREAT DAY FOR THESE GUYS 
GOOD TO 
SEE THE FLAGS 
IT WOULD BE TERRIFIC 
IF LIKE HARRY SAID BOTH SETS OF 
SUPPORTERS WERE THERE AT THE END L. 
WOULDN'T PUT MONEY ON IT THOUGH 
WHO ARE YOU GOING FOR 
I'M GOING TO 
GO FOR PORTSMOUTH L. THINK THEY 
WILL BE TOO STRONG FOR THEM THEY 
GET THE SEMI FINAL AT THE WAY AND 
THEY WILL WIN 
I AM GETTING ALAN 
HANSEN WILL GO FOR PORTSMOUTH SO 
WHY WILL GO FOR CARDIFF 
I CAN'T

OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF

CITY VERSUS CARDIFF CITY THESE FANS WILL NOT REMEMBER THE 
COMMENTATORS FOR B. B. C. RADIO WHEN THE 
CUP FINAL WAS FIRST BROADCAST 
CRITICALLY IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN THE YEAR THAT 
CARDIFF CITY BEAT ARSENAL AND CARRY 
THE TROPHY OUT OF ENGLAND FOR THE 
ONLY TIME IN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX FINALS THE COMMENTATOR'S JOB ON THAT DATE 
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO WAS TO REFER 
PEOPLE TO THE RADIO TIMES SO THEY 
COULD PICTURE IT WHILE THEY DID 
THEIR COMMENTARY BROADCASTING HAS 
COME ON IN THE LAST EIGHTY ONE YEARS I I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU I WE ARE A FEW 
MINUTES AWAY FROM KICK OFF THE 
ROMANCE OF THIS COMPETITION HAS 
COME BACK TODAY SOME OF THE SCENES

EXACTLY THE SAME THING HAPPEN AND 
IT WAS BETTER THAT TIME 
AS YOU 
SAID EARLIER THE ATMOSPHERE TODAY 
THE SECOND FINAL IN THE REBUILT 
STADIUM IS FABULOUS AS THE 
PLAYERS COME OUT INTO THE TUNNEL 
BACK IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN CONTINUING THAT THEME 
MAY BE FOR THE LAST TIME THE 
CARDIFF TEAM RAN OUT FIRST 
BOUNCING A BALL BUT THOSE DAYS 
HAVE GONE IT IS CEREMONIAL TWO 
TEAMS GATHERING SIDE BY SIDE 
TICKETS ARE EVEN HARDER TO GET THEM 
THEY WERE FOR THE CHELSEA 
MANCHESTER UNITED FINAL THIS TIME 
LAST YEAR THE STADIUM CAPACITY IS 
NINETY THOUSAND IT WILL NOT BE FAR SHORT OF 
THAT TODAY HE IS HAVING A NAP 
DO YOU THINK IT IS THIS GOOD 
BECAUSE THESE TWO TEAMS WOULD NOT 
BE HERE OFTEN 
YES AND IT IS MAYBE 
THAT THEY WILL NOT BE BACK AGAIN 
IF YOU HAVE A TICKET YOU WILL 
ENJOY YOURSELF 
THAT IS WHAT THEY 
ARE PLAYING FOR 
WHAT A DAY OR HONEY FOR HARRY 
REDKNAPP

THE OFFICIALS THIS YEAR ARE HIM MIKE DEAN THE REFEREE HIS TWO 
ASSISTANT MARTIN YERBY AND TREVOR 
MASSEY THE FOURTH OFFICIAL CHRIS FOY 
WHO IS THE REFEREE AND PETER 
KIRKUP BECAUSE WE HAVE AN 
ASSISTANT IN RESERVE AS WELL 
THE CARDIFF CAPTAIN IS STEPHEN 
MCPHAIL IT WOULD BE QUITE 
INTERESTING IF THEY WIN THE CUP 
BECAUSE THE CLUB CAPTAIN IS A 
SUBSTITUTE SO WE COULD SEE A JOINT 
CELEBRATION BUT THAT IS JUMPING 
THE GUN A GREAT DAY FOR DAVID 
JONES HE HAS OVERCOME A LOT OF 
HURDLES IN HIS CAREER HE WAS 
HAVING TO COPE WITH A LOT OF 
UNFOUNDED ALLEGATIONS AT ONE TIME 
AT SOUTHAMPTON THEN HE WENT TO 
WOLVES GOT THEM TO THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE AND HAD TO ENDURE DIFFICULT 
DAYS AT CARDIFF EARLY ON HE SOLD A 
AWFUL LOT OF PLAYERS BUT HE IS 
HERE TODAY A PROUD MANAGER OF 
COWBIT CARDIFF CITY AND EQUALLY 
PROUD NOW EVERY WELCHMAN AND LADY 
PRESENT AND ALL THOSE WATCHING 
WITH US AS KATHERINE JENKINS SINGS 
LAND OF MY FATHER'S LAND OF MY FATHERS 
SHE CAN HIT A NOTE RAPTUROUSLY 
RECEIVED AND NOW NATIONAL AND 
SOME GOD SAVE THE QUEEN AT THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM GOD SAVE THE QUEEN A VERY GOOD START TO THE AFTERNOON 
IN TERMS OF SINGING ATMOSPHERE 
FLAG WAVING ANTICIPATION 
EXPECTATION WE SHARE IT APPEAR AS 
WE WAIT TO SHOW YOU AGAIN THE LINE 
UPS HARRY REDKNAPP GOING DOWN HIS 
LINE OF PORTSMOUTH PLAYERS WISHING 
THEM ALL THE BEST INDIVIDUALLY 
HERE COME THE CARDIFF BOYS 
REDKNAPP BROUGHT PEDRO MENDES BACK 
INTO HIS MIDFIELD LAST WEEK AND HE 
KEEPS HIS PLACE AS THE ANCHOR AT 
THE EXPENSE OF PAPA BOUBA DIOP 
JOHN UTAKA WHO MISSED THE SEMI 
FINAL THROUGH INJURY IS PART OF A 
FIVE MAN MIDFIELD INITIALLY BEHIND 
KANU WHOSE 
POMPEY 
BACK TO 
WEMBLEY 
EXPECT UTAKA AND 
KRANJCAR TO PUSH OUT AND MAKE IT FOUR 
THREE TO THREE SINCE THE SEMI FINAL PAUL 
PARRY HAS REGAINED FITNESS HE IS 
UP FRONT WITH THIRTY SIX YEAR OLD JIMMY 
FLOYD HASSELBAINK FOR THOSE OF YOU 
NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE TEAM PETER 
ENCKELMAN IN GOAL KEVIN MCNAUGHTON 
ROGER JOHNSON GLENN LOOVENS TONY 
CAPALDI IN MIDFIELD JOE LEDLEY 
MAY GO ON THE LEFT WE WILL SEE 
GAVIN RAE STEPHEN MCPHAIL AND 
PETER WHITTINGHAM UP THE MIDDLE 
PARRY AND HASSELBAINK ROBBIE 
FOWLER DID NOT MAKE THE SIXTY NUMERAL 
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER VETERAN ON THE 
BENCH THE SIXTEENTH TREVOR SINCLAIR 
IS OLD ENOUGH TO BE AARON RAMSEY'S 
FATHER HE IS SEVENTEEN YEARS ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR DAYS OLD 
HE WOULD BE THE SECOND YOUNGEST F. A. 
CUP FINALIST EVER IF HE WINS THE 
F. A. CUP IN FACT HE IS ALREADY THE 
SECOND YOUNGEST PLAYER TO CURTIS 
WESTERN OF MILLWALL DAVID NUGENT 
IS ON THE PORTSMOUTH BENCH ROGER JOHNSON WHO SCORED AT MIDDLESBROUGH IN THE SIXTH ROUND THE CAPTAINS WITH THE OFFICIALS 
SOL CAMPBELL ON THE RIGHT F. A. CUP 
WINNER WITH ARSENAL AND STEPHEN 
MCPHAIL WHO WAS AT LEEDS UNITED 
AND BARNSLEY JUST BEEN RECALLED BY 
THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND THAT WAS A SPOOF TOSS I THINK 
PORTSMOUTH WON THE TOSS FOR COLLARS 
SO THEY WILL PLAY IN BLUE CARDIFF 
CITY WILL NOT MIND PLAYING IN BLACK 
COLOURS IT HAS BEEN A LUCKY OMEN 
FOR THEM IN THE CUP PORTSMOUTH PORTSMOUTH KANU UP FRONT ON HIS OWN IT WILL 
BE INTERESTING HE CAN'T DO IT 
ANYMORE KANU AS FAR AS RUNNING 
PAST DEFENDERS HE IS GREAT AT 
HOLDING UP THE BALL AND LINKING UP 
PLAY THE ONUS IS ON A KRANJCAR 
FROM THE LEFT AND UTAKA FROM THE 
RIGHT MAYBE EVEN MUNTARI TO GET UP 
AND STRETCH CARDIFF AT THE BACK WE WE BOTH KNOW PORTSMOUTH STARTED VERY 
SLOWLY AGAINST WEST BROM TONY 
ADAMS HAS SAID THAT THE IDEA IS TO 
GET UTAKA AND KRANJCAR FORWARD 
QUICKLY AND HAVE A GO AT CARDIFF 
EARLY ON 
THEY FROZE UNDER THE 
MANTLE OF FAVOURITE 
HERE WE GO 
THEN THE F. A. CUP FINAL OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVENTH IN THE HISTORY OF THIS FAMOUS 
COMPETITION ONLY ONCE HAS THE F. A. 
CUP BEEN CARRIED OUT OF ENGLAND 
AND THAT WAS BY CARDIFF CITY IN 
NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN PORTSMOUTH WON IT IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AND 
KEPT IT FOR SIX YEARS DURING THE 
WAR AND NOW BUT CLUBS ARE BACK 
HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
BOTH CLUBS IMMEDIATELY DIARRA 
GETS GOING FOR PORTSMOUTH AND GETS 
A FREE KICK L. FANCY HE WILL PLAY A 
BIT FURTHER FORWARD THAN HE DID IN 
THE SEMI FINAL LAST SUMMER DOCTOR 
DEFINITELY MENDES JUST SITTING IN 
PLAYING THE BALL 
DIARRA HERMANN 
HREIDARSSON HAS GONE UP FOR THE 
FIRST FREE KICK NIKO KRANJCAR HAS 
PUT THE BALL DOWN HREIDARSSON IN THE CENTRE WITH HIS ARM UP THE PETER ENCKELMAN INCIDENTALLY 
STILL ON LOAN TO CARDIFF FROM 
BLACKBURN ROVERS MAKES THE FIRST 
SAVE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE SHOT FROM SAVE THERE ON THE FAR SIDE PAUL PARRY CAME IN 
HE'S GOT THE PACE FORCED DAVID 
JAMES TO ADVANCE 
THE BALL WAS 
PLAYED OVER SOL CAMPBELL DAVID 
JAMES DID REALLY WELL HIS STARTING 
POSITION WAS SEVEN OR EIGHT YARDS 
OUT OF HIS GOAL AND IT MADE ALL THE 
DIFFERENCE OTHERWISE JOHN IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN TOUCH AND GO FOR A 
PENALTY AND ALL SORTS THE HE WAS 
ONSIDE PARRY HE WAS CATT ING DELIVERS A LONG THROW IN FOR CARDIFF CAPALDI IT WAS KANU AND JOHNSON HAVING 
WORDS WITH EACH OTHER PUSHING AND 
SHOVING 
HE'S QUITE A HANDFUL AT SHOVING SET PLAYS JOHNSON TONY ADAMS 
RELEASED HIM WHEN HE WAS MANAGER AT 
WYCOMBE IT WOULD BE AN IRONY IF HE 
SCORED TODAY A P. C. START MARK A GOOD START PACY START NO FREE KICK IT WAS WORTH A TRY 
JIMMY FLOYD KNEW HE WAS NOT GOING 
TO GO PAST UTAKA GOING BACK TO HIS RIGHT SIDED POSITION THERE GLENN LOOVENS THE DUTCHMAN HREIDARSSON JUST MAKING SURE WHITTINGHAM IS COVERED TONY ADAMS THERE ALONGSIDE HARRY 
REDKNAPP HE LIFTED THE CUP THREE 
TIMES AS THE ARSENAL CAPTAIN A GOOD BREAK BY LOOVENS SOL 
CAMPBELL BROKE IT UP AND GAVE THE 
BALL AWAY GOT AWAY WITH IT YOU YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE GLENN LOOVENS SO 
FAR FORWARD IN OPEN PLAY THEY HAVEN'T QUITE MANAGED TO PICK OUT KANU YET ONE OF CARDIFF'S EARLY PROBLEMS 
WILL BE IN THE CENTRE OF MIDFIELD 
MCPHAIL AND RAE ARE TAKING ON 
DIARRA MUNTARI AND MENDES 
IF DAVE 
JONES' TEAM WIN THE F. A. CUP THEY 
WOULD GO INTO THE UEFA CUP SO 
THERE 
IS A BIG PRIZE TODAY ANOTHER CHANCE FOR A LONG CAPALDI THROW IN PORTSMOUTH PLAYERS SLIPPING THAT IS GOING TO GIVE CARDIFF CITY THE 
FIRST CORNER SO JOHNSON WILL STAY 
FORWARD JOE LEDLEY WILL TAKE IT PORTSMOUTH BROKE OUT WELL AGAIN THEY ARE LOOKING FOR PARRY 
TO USE HIS SPEED TO GET THE OTHER 
SIDE OF THE PORTSMOUTH BACK FOUR 
IT'S BE GOOD PLOY HE RUNS ALL THE 
CHANNELS ALL DAY PARRY IT IS 
MATTER OF DOVETAILING BETWEEN THE 
TWO OF THEM DON'T EXPECT TOO MANY GOALS TODAY 
PORTSMOUTH HAVE ONLY CONCEDED ONE 
IN THE F. A. CUP SO FAR CARDIFF TWO CAPALDI WILL TAKE THE CHANCE TO COME FORWARD WHEN HE CAN NIKO KRANJCAR GET THE PUT IN KANU COULDN'T GET THERE FREE KICK DIARRA JUST CAUGHT 
HASSELBAINK MR. BALL COMPLETELY 
MISSED THE BALL THE TWO CARDIFF 
CITY FULL BACKS WILL SEE LOTS OF 
THE BALL TODAY KRANJCAR AND UTAKA 
RETREAT INTO FIVE MAN WHEN THEY LOSE THE BALL IT WAS HIS 
THE THIRD ROUND IT WAS JOE LEDLEY OVER THERE 
CARDIFF BORN A WELSHMAN THROUGH 
AND THROUGH GAVIN RAE A BUNDLE OF ENERGY IN MIDFIELD GLEN JOHNSON DID NOT GET THERE IT 
IS A FOUL BY JOHNSON 
WE SPOKE 
BEFORE ABOUT SOMEONE RUNNING THE 
OTHER 
FOR PORTSMOUTH 
IT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET WE HAVE 
SEEN PARRY ALREADY DO IT A COUPLE 
OF TIMES PORTSMOUTH DAVID JAMES A FIRST TIME CLEARANCE A FREE KICK TO CARDIFF THE TWO CLUBS HAVE NEVER MET BEFORE IN THE F. A. CUP THIS IS WHERE THEY LIKE KANU TO 
HOLD IT UP AND BRING OTHERS INTO 
PLAY IT HAS BEEN BROKEN UP AND THERE IS A BRAKE ON POSSIBLY FOR HASSELBAINK IT WAS A GOOD IDEA BUT IT NEEDS TO 
BE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT FOR JIMMY 
FLOYD BUT THE IDEA WAS GOOD HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE HAD A FREE KICK AND DID NOT GET IT PARRY WAS IN THERE AGAIN FOR 
CARDIFF AND DAVID JAMES REQUIRED 
ONCE MORE TO SAVE WITH HIS FEET A A GREAT LITTLE BALL IN AGAIN JUST 
INSIDE SOL CAMPBELL A LITTLE BIT 
FORTUITOUS HOW IT CAME ABOUT A 
GOOD SAVE BY JAMES TWO TIMES IN 
THAT PARTICULAR POSITION BOTH BOTH AGAINST PARRY DEFLECTED AND OFF HIS OWN MAN AS WELL DAVID 
JAMES WAS GRANTED 
THE REFEREE HAS 
GIVEN A GOAL KICK 
A DECENT BALL 
WITH THE OUTSIDE OF THE GUT NOT 
THE GREATEST CLEARANCE IN THE WORLD 
BUT I FEEL WITH PORTSMOUTH IT IS 
LIKE THE START AGAINST WEST BROM 
DON'T YOU THINK SO 
WITH A FOUR THREE THREE 
KANU IS A BIT ISOLATED ISN'T HE 
THEY HAVE NOT HIT A BALL OVER THE 
TOP AT THE MOMENT CARDIFF LOOKED 
THE BETTER TEAM 
THAT IS CERTAINLY 
HOW IT WAS WITH WEST BROM BECAUSE 
KEVIN PHILLIPS GAVE PORTSMOUTH ALL 
SORTS OF TROUBLE DAVID JONES MUST 
FEEL HIS SIDE HAD STARTED WELL A 
FREE KICK TO PORTSMOUTH GLEN JOHNSON HAS PUT THE BALL DOWN 
WAITING FOR HREIDARSSON TO COME 
FORWARD HE WAITS THERE WITH SOL 
CAMPBELL AND DISTIN THE GOALKEEPER FUMBLED IT NEARLY FOUR KANU THAT WAS A WORRYING MOMENT FOR PETER ENCKELMAN A BETTER SPELL FOR PORTSMOUTH THAT WAS LASSANA DIARRA PETER 
ENCKELMAN WILL BE DELIGHTED BECAUSE 
HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH ONE THERE IS 
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THERE WAS VERY 
LITTLE OR NO PRESSURE ON HIM AND HE 
HAS JUST FUMBLED THIS VERY STRANGE 
MCNAUGHTON AND LOOVENS HELPED HIM 
OUT IN THE END BUT HE SHOULD HAVE 
CAUGHT IT 
KANU COULD NOT TURN IT 
IN 
IT IS THAT IT IS AS THOUGH HE IN MADE HIS MIND UP WHAT HE WANTED TO 
DO FABIO CAPELLO WAITING FOR AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO SAMPLE THE 
ATMOSPHERE OF THE F. A. CUP FINAL 
THERE IS PLENTY OF THAT THE BALL WAS ALT IT IS A CARDIFF THROW OUT A GOOD INTERCEPTION BY KEVIN MCNAUGHTON 
ONE OR TWO POMPEY MCNAUGHTON SUPPORTERS THOUGHT IT WAS A BACK 
PASS THERE IS A DECISION TO BE MADE BY A 
CARDIFF ABOUT WHETHER TO OFFER 
PETER ENCKELMAN A CONTRACT HE HAS 
DONE WELL SINCE HE CAME IN JANUARY THE GAME IS SETTLING DOWN NOW GOOD MANIPULATION OF THE BALL BY 
LASSANA DIARRA BUT JOHN UTAKA 
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO 
REACH THAT 
THE PASS WAS NOT GOOD 
ENOUGH GOOD SKILL NOW IT IS A FREE KICK 
TO CARDIFF PETER WHITTINGHAM 
IS GOING ACROSS TO TAKE CHARGE HERE DOES ALL THAT IS THE FURTHEST FORWARD AT THE 
MOMENT HASSELBAINK LOOVENS WILL 
NOT BE FAR AWAY IT WAS GOOD DEFENDING BY SOL 
CAMPBELL FOR A SPLIT SECOND I 
THOUGHT THAT JOHNSON WAS FAVOURITE 
TO WIN IT A GREAT LEAP BY SOL 
CAMPBELL 
IT IS ANOTHER CARDIFF CAMPBELL CORNER JOHNSON STAYS RIGHT IN 
THERE DAVID JAMES PLUCKS THAT ALT IT IS A FREE KICK I THINK UTAKA 
FOULED CAPALDI THE REFEREE TRIED 
TO PLAY ADVANTAGE WE SAW IT WITH 
PORTSMOUTH I'M NOT SURE WHO WAS ON 
THE BALL BEFORE THE INCIDENT THERE 
IS ANY KANU THERE IS NO ONE ELSE 
TO HIT THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO RUN 
IN BEHIND THAT THE MOMENT JERMAIN JERMAIN DEFOE HAS BEEN PLAYING IN THE 
LEAGUE GAMES AND HE IS CUP TIED 
OBVIOUSLY AND MILAN BAROS AND 
DAVID NUGENT ARE ON THE BENCH CAN THEY GET SOMEONE UP WITH KANU THIS TIME BRILLIANT HE DID BRING ME ABSOLUTELY THAT 
WAS THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE HAD RUN 
FROM MIDFIELD WHICH WAS THE UTAKA 
WATCH HIS LITTLE POSITION 
HREIDARSSON AND HE IS AWAY IT IS 
A GREAT BALL IN AS WELL 
HE ONCE 
SCORED A GOAL AT CHELSEA FOR 
ARSENAL FROM A NOT DISSIMILAR KIND 
OF TIGHT ANGLE THIS TIME HE 
SLIPPED IT THE WRONG SIDE OF THE 
POST 
BETTER FROM PORTSMOUTH IT POST CERTAINLY HARRY HOW CLOSE WAS THAT CAN'T GET MUCH CLOSER FIRST TIME HE HAD HAD ANY SUPPORT 
ABSOLUTELY AND WE ARE HALFWAY 
THROUGH THE FIRST HALF IT'S A FREE KICK FOR JOE LEDLEY 
RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE AREA 
AGAINST 
GLEN JOHNSON GLEN JOHNSON 
SHOWED HIM THAT WAY AND HE WENT HE 
HAS 
WON HIMSELF A FREE KICK HE 
HAS CAUGHT HIM NO ARGUMENT THERE WHITTINGHAM AND MCPHAIL ON THE 
BALL THE TWO CENTRE BACKS ARE 
FORWARD AGAIN WHITTINGHAM TO TAKE IT OH IT WAS PARRY WHO DROPPED BACK 
AND GOT A SHOT IN EVERYBODY ELSE 
WAS BUNCHED UP IN THE PENALTY AREA KRANJCAR WAS WELL FORWARD THERE BUT 
HE HAS LOST IT 
HE DELAYED THE PAST 
A BRILLIANT TACKLE GOING BACK TO 
THE FREE KICK A LOVELY CHANCE FOR 
PARRY ON HIS LEFT FOR IT PASS 
LEFT FOOT PARRY AGAIN THROUGH THE MIDDLE 
CAMPBELL CROSS HAD TO BE CORNER 
THE OLD FASHIONED LONG BALL CORNER TURNING AROUND THE TWO CENTRAL 
DEFENDERS PROBABLY THE THIRD 
OCCASION WE HAVE SEEN THIS YES YES WHITTINGHAM WILL TAKE THE CORNER LOOVENS WAS AT THE BACK GOAL KICK 
A WASTE REALLY JUST GOING BACK TO 
THE CARDIFF FREE KICK IT WAS 
WONDERFUL CHANCE PORTSMOUTH SAT 
BACK SIX YARDS OUT FROM THE 
GOALKEEPER A LITTLE PULL BACK 
PARRY SHOULD HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER HREIDARSSON MISCUE CAPALDI AGAIN WITH THE THROW IN LEDLEY BROUGHT DOWN A DAFT FOUL 
THAT IS 
THEY HAVE HAD PLENTY OF 
CORNERS AND FREE KICKS AND THROW 
INS CARDIFF JOHNSON GOOD DELIVERY AS WELL FROM THE 
CARDIFF FREE KICKS HE EATS VERY 
HARD TO GET IT JUST COULDN'T QUITE 
DIRECTED ON TARGET LEAPS VERY 
HIGH NOTHING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO TEAMS 
NOT REALLY CARDIFF IN THE TEAMS CHAMPIONSHIP THEY FINISHED TWELFTH 
PORTSMOUTH'S EIGHTH PLACE TO FINISH 
IN THE PREMIERSHIP WAS THEIR BEST 
EVER EVEN THOUGH THEY LOST THEIR 
LAST FOUR GAMES HASSELBAINK TRYING TO GET PARRY A 
WAY FOR CARDIFF CITY 
IT'S THAT 
BALL AGAIN ISN'T IT BEHIND THE 
TWO CENTRAL DEFENDERS DOWN THE 
SIDES THE VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR 
CARDIFF IN TERMS OF TERRITORY CARDIFF BEAT CHASETOWN HEREFORD 
WALLS AND BARNSLEY TO GET HERE 
PORTSMOUTH BEAT PLYMOUTH IPSWICH 
PRESTON MANCHESTER UNITED AND WEST 
BROMWICH ALBION AFTER HALF AN HOUR MARK YOU CAN'T 
REALLY SEPARATE THEM 
NO DIFFERENCE 
WHATSOEVER PORTSMOUTH HAD THE BEST 
CHANCE THROUGH KANU BUT I THINK 
CARDIFF ARE PLAYING THE BETTER 
FOOTBALL BLUE ARMY LASSANA DIARRA SHOWING NIMBLE 
STILL IN POSSESSION SKILL IN 
POSSESSION 
JUST OVERPLAYED IT POSSESSION UNFORTUNATELY 
FREE KICK AGAINST UNFORTUNATELY GAVIN RAE THE TACKLE WAS ON PEDRO 
MENDES 
I THINK HE'S MADE THE MOST MENDES OF IT GONE ARE THE DAYS WHEN YOU USED TO 
BE ABLE TO DO THAT PUT YOUR FOOT 
UP AND WON A TACKLE 
A CHANGING 
GAME PORTSMOUTH WILL SEND A FEW 
FORWARD FOR THIS IT WAS TOWARDS UTAKA WELL WE SAID THIS IN THE SEMI 
FINAL NOT A GREAT DEAL OF PREMIER 
LEAGUE QUALITY FROM PORTSMOUTH SO 
FAR 
WELL THERE ISN'T THEY ARE FAR REACTING TO WHAT CARDIFF ARE DOING 
RATHER THAN THE OTHER WAY AROUND L. 
JUST THINK WE HAVE PROBABLY 
BORED EVERYONE BY SAYING NO ONE IS 
RUNNING BEHIND KANU BUT THERE IS 
NOT A LOT OF WIDTH 
I THINK KANU IS 
GETTING BORED BY IT KANU IS 
SIGNALLING NOW LET'S GET AROUND A 
BIT MORE I JUST THOUGHT JIMMY FLOYD MIGHT 
CARVE OUT A CHANCE THERE FOR A 
MOMENT KANU WILL HAVE A GO YEAH HE DID WELL TO GET HIMSELF 
THE OPENING BUT I CANNOT RECALL 
TOO MANY GOALS THAT KANU HAS SCORED 
FROM TWENTY PLUS YARDS IN HIS CAREER 
HAS GOT JUST SIX THIS SEASON 
INCLUDING THE SEMI FINAL WINNER 
JERMAIN DEFOE BECAUSE HE PLAYED 
JUST A FEW MINUTES AS A SUBSTITUTE 
FOR TOTTENHAM IN AN EARLIER ROUND 
CAN'T TAKE PART 
HOW FRUSTRATING IS 
THAT I THINK HE MIGHT MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE 
IT WOULD 
FREE KICK DIFFERENCE PORTSMOUTH PLENTY IN THE MIDDLE ENCKELMAN PUNCHING AWAY GLEN JOHNSON'S CROSS MENDES HAS GOT A POWERFUL SHOT 
WELL STRUCK UNFORTUNATELY 
STRAIGHT AT THE GOALKEEPER BUT THE 
DECISION BEFORE BY ENCKELMAN TO 
PUNCH FROM THE CROSS WAS A VERY 
GOOD ONE JOHNSON DOES WELL ON THE 
RIGHT THIS IS A GOOD SAVE YOU KNOW 
LOSS OF HEIGHT AND DISTANCE LOTS OF HEIGHT OR OFFSIDE GIVEN A NICE LITTLE 
BALL PLAYED BY MUNTARI AROUND THE 
CORNER TO KANU JUST ABOUT STILL 
OFF THOUGH ISN'T HE YES BLUE ARMY BLUE ARMY SOL CAMPBELL AND DISTIN HAVE NOT 
DONE MUCH WRONG AS A PARTNERSHIP 
FOR PORTSMOUTH THIS SEASON JOHNSON 
PENALISED FOR PUSHING POMPEY SUPPORTERS NOT HAPPY WITH 
THE REFEREE NOT GIVING THEM ANY 
DECISIONS I THINK HE IS DOING 
QUITE WELL 
I'D DO HE DESERVES THE 
APPOINTMENT MIKE DEAN BECAUSE HE 
GOT THE FINAL TWO YEARS AGO BUT 
LIVERPOOL GOT THERE AND HE WAS 
REPLACED 
HE USED TO PLAY IN SUNDAY REPLACED LEAGUE WITH RAY STUBBS WOULD YOU 
BELIEVE I WOULD HAVE PAID TO SEE 
THAT KANU IS THERE BUT NO IS IT GIVEN 
THE ASSISTANT REFEREE STAYS WHERE 
HE IS MIKE DEAN WALKS AWAY KANU 
AND PORTSMOUTH TO THINK THEY HAVE 
TAKEN THE LEAD 
WELL THEY HAVE 
A BRILLIANT CROSS ENCKELMAN 
PUNCHES IT AWAY FANTASTIC 
REACTIONS BY KANU 
WATCHED THE 
ASSISTANT REFEREE HE STOPS FOR A 
MOMENT ANYWAY IT'S A GOAL NO NO ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT LOVELY CROSS 
BY UTAKA IT CAME OFF ENCKELMAN 
HE'S VERY QUICK KANU 
KANU WHO 
SCORED THE WINNER IN THE SEMI FINAL 
OPENS THE SCORING IN THE FINAL A 
OPENS THE SCORING IN THE FINAL A BIT OF A FUMBLE BY ENCKELMAN BUT 
KANU WAS SO QUICK TO GET HIS FOOT 
IN THERE AHEAD OF ROGER JOHNSON I I THINK THE REFEREE'S ASSISTANT MIGHT 
HAVE THOUGHT THERE WAS A SUSPICION 
OF HANDBALL IT DEFINITELY WASN'T 
NO BUT INTERESTINGLY IN THE SEMI 
FINAL THERE WAS A HANDBALL BY BAROS 
HE REACTED SO QUICKLY KANU THIRTY SEVEN MINUTES THE GOAL TIME 
PORTSMOUTH ON TOP NOW KANU WHO 
GOT TWO WINNERS' MEDALS WITH 
ARSENAL GIVES THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
SIDE THE EDGE ENCKELMAN STRUGGLED TO GET IT 
ACROSS AS WELL HE HAD TO PUSH ONE 
OF HIS DEFENDERS OUT OF THE WAY 
GET THAT ACROSS A SUPERGRASS 
WASN'T IT YES 
HALF YARD YES WHIPPED ACROSS IN SUPER CROSS IT IS A BREAK FOR HASSELBAINK THAT IS ONE HECK OF A TACKLE BY SOL CAMPBELL 
BE IT WAS A GOOD TACKLE CAMPBELL MIND YOU JIMMY FLOYD OVERRAN THE 
BALL UP I'M AFRAID PORTSMOUTH HAVE WON ALL TWENTY ONE GAMES IN 
WHICH THEY HAVE SCORED FIRST THIS 
SEASON 
AND SOMETHING THEY DO DO SEASON WELL IS KEEP THE BALL 
IT DOESN'T 
BODE WELL FOR CARDIFF DOES IT IT WAS A POOR PASS THERE IS NO FLAG IN CAME MCNAUGHTON ALL THE WAY 
FROM RIGHT BACK 
I JUST THINK THAT 
WHEN PARRY GOT HIMSELF IN THE 
POSITION I WAS THINKING ARE YOU 
GOING TO SHOOT OR NOT BECAUSE OF 
THE WIDTH HERE HE DECIDES NOT TO 
IT IS A GOOD IDEA BUT THE PASS WAS 
THROUGH QUICK 
UNSELFISH BY PARRY 
YOU CAN SEE WHY HE DIDN'T SHOOT 
BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE 
IT COULD HAVE 
BEEN ONE TO ONE KEVIN MCNAUGHTON AS I 
SAID EARLIER HAD AN UP AND DOWN 
TIME IN THIS COMPETITION 
HE MADE 
SEVENTY YARDS VERY QUICKLY IT IS KANU'S GOAL THAT SEPARATES 
THE TEAM AS WE GO TO THE FORTY FIRST 
MINUTE OF A HALF THIS IS HOW IT 
HAPPENED JOHN UTAKA SQUEEZED THE 
CROSS IN THE GOALKEEPER COULDN'T 
HOLD ON AND KANU PUT IT IN THERE THERE IS BIG LONG RANGY LEGS ISN'T IT THOSE NINETEEN THIRTY NINE THE LAST TIME PORTSMOUTH WERE 
ABLE TO CELEBRATE AT WEMBLEY IN AN 
F. A. CUP FINAL PARRY HAS BEEN THEIR BEST OUTLET AND THE FIRST HALF IN THE FIRST HALF DIARRA COULDN'T PICK OUT KRANJCAR 
HE WILL TRY AGAIN HE DOESN'T GET FREE KICK THOUGH CARDIFF DO MENDES IS SAYING THAT 
IT HIT HIM IN THE FACE 
IS THERE A 
WAY BACK FOR THE WELSHMAN BEFORE 
HALF TIME THIS IS NOT NORTON WHO CAME CLOSE A FEW MINUTES AGO MCNAUGHTON PARRY COULDN'T KEEP HIS BALANCE POMPEY CHIMES ARE RINGING AROUND WEMBLEY KANU WAS RUNNING OFFSIDE FOR A 
MOMENT IT BROKE UP PORTSMOUTH'S 
RHYTHM JOHN UTAKA CAUGHT HIM HE IS SAYING 
STRAIGHTAWAY TO THE REFEREE 
THERE IS A FAMOUS FAN 
WE HAVE SEEN 
HIM BEFORE HE HAS ALL THE NAMES 
AND ALL THE TATTOOS 
YOU ON NOT 
LIKELY TO FORGET HIM IT IS A GREAT 
REACTION FROM KANU YOU OFF YOU ARE MCPHAIL HAS CAUGHT ONE IN THE MOUTH 
THEY WILL JUST GIVE THE BALL BACK 
HERE 
IT LOOKS LIKE CARDIFF ARE HERE GOING IN A ONE DOWN BUT THERE HAVE 
BEEN SOME ENCOURAGING MOMENTS THEY 
HAVE NOT DONE A LOT WRONG 
CERTAINLY GLEN JOHNSON HIS FIRST TOUCH LET 
HIM DOWN THEN HE COMMITTED THE 
FOUL 
THE BALL WAS PITCHED AWAY FOUL FROM HIM IT WILL STOP TRYING TO GET 
IT BACK I THINK HE HAS CAUGHT 
LEDLEY BEST FROM IT 
ONE REMIT 
WILL BE ADDED AT THE END OF THE FORTY FIVE 
FROM IT IF CARDIFF ARE GOING TO 
GO BACK TO THE DRESSING ROOM WITH 
ANYTHING TO SHOW FOR THIS THEY 
WILL HAVE TO SCORE PRETTY FAST JOHNSON IS UP THERE AGAIN HE BOUNCED OFF A PORTSMOUTH PLAYER AND WON A FREE KICK SOL CAMPBELL WAS NOT VERY HAPPY 
WITH THAT FREE KICK AWARD AND HE 
IS SOMEBODY ELSE WHO IS NOT 
HREIDARSSON EIGHT YELLOW CARD FOR 
HERMANN HREIDARSSON FOR DISSENT A A DAFT FREE KICK TO GIVE AWAY IT WAS 
NOT SOL CAMPBELL 
A DELAY HERE 
BEFORE WHITTINGHAM CAN TAKE IT CAN 
CARDIFF CITY EQUALISED ON THE 
STROKE OF HALF TIME EQUALISED EQUALISE A BIT OF MOVEMENT ABOUT THE FAR 
POST GLEN JOHNSON SQUEEZED THE 
BALL OUT FOR POMPEY 
GOOD DEFENSIVE 
PLAY SULLEY MUNTARI WILL BREATHE A 
SIGH OF RELIEF IT WAS HIS STUPID 
FREE KICK IN TERMS OF GIVING IT 
AWAY 
LEDLEY HAS GONE ACROSS TO AWAY TAKE THE CORNER DAVID JAMES DIDN'T REALLY CLAIM 
THAT FIRST TIME IT HAS BEEN HACKED 
BACK IN NO GOAL MIKE DEAN HAS 
WIPED THAT ONE OUT THERE IS NO 
DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
I THINK THE 
WHISTLE HAD ALREADY GONE DAVID DAVID JAMES HAS HAD HIS WORRYING MOMENTS 
AT WEMBLEY WITH CUP FINAL CORNERS 
WHEN THAT WAS HOOKED BACK IN IT IS 
IT HANDS 
I THINK THE REFEREE GIVES 
THIS FOREHANDS HE DOES NOT GIVE IT 
FOR FOUL THERE IS NOTHING ROLE 
NOTHING WRONG HIS WHISTLE WENT TO 
HIS MOUTH STRAIGHT AWAY A GREAT 
FINISH AS WELL 
IT WAS THE DUTCHMAN 
GLENN LOOVENS PERHAPS A SHADE 
UNFORTUNATE 
I DO NOT 
THINK SO L. UNFORTUNATE THINK IT IS HANDBALL EVERYONE 
STRAIGHT AWAY THINKS IT IS THE FOUL 
BUT HE WAS NOT OLD CLOCK QUITE 
SIMPLY HE WAS NOT FILED 
AND THE WHISTLE BLOWS IMMEDIATELY 
FAR HALF TIME AND PORTSMOUTH THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE SIDE HAVE THE 
ADVANTAGE THE GOALSCORER ON THIRTY SEVEN 
MINUTES WAS KANU CARDIFF CITY WHO 
STARTED PRETTY WELL GOING TO THE 
DRESSING ROOM THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
SIDE A GOAL BEHIND PAUL PARRY 
THEIR MOST DANGEROUS ATTACKER 
CERTAINLY EARLY ON BUT AT HALF 
TIME IT IT IS CARDIFF CITY ZERO 
PORTSMOUTH ONE 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
SIDE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE BUT IT HAS 
BEEN A FREE FLOWING GAME AND END 
TO END STUFF AND EITHER SIDE COULD 
HAVE LED 
MOST ENJOYABLE WE HAVE 
HAD CHANCES WE HAVE HAD EXCITEMENT 
WE HAVE THAT ENTERTAINMENT AND A 
GOAL THE BIG THING AS FAR AS 
CARDIFF WERE ITS ARE CONCERNED 
THEY HAVE LEFT PARRY UP FRONT 
JIMMY FLOYD HASSELBAINK HAS CAUSED 
SOL CAMPBELL NO END OF PROBLEMS 
THEY HAD BEEN INVENTIVE WIT THEY 
SAID PLAYS BUT IT IS A CRUEL GAME 
ENCKELMAN MADE A MISTAKE AND GOT 
AWAY WITH IT BUT HE MADE TWO AND 
PAID THE PRICE DAVID JAMES GOT 
AWAY WITH IT ON ANOTHER DAY IT 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BOTH BOTH SIDES HAVE TRIED TO PLAY GOOD 
FOOTBALL 
THEY HAVE PLAYED IT IN FOOTBALL THE RIGHT WAY THEY HAVE BOTH HAD 
GOOD CHANCES THERE HAS BEEN VERY 
LITTLE BETWEEN THE SIDES THERE HAS 
BEEN A GOALKEEPER'S MISTAKE BETWEEN 
THEM LET'S BE HONEST ALAN HANSEN 
SAID HE DIDN'T GET AWAY WITH THAT 
ONE BUT VERY LITTLE BETWEEN THE 
SIDES 
YOU COULDN'T GIVE UP ON SIDES CARDIFF AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE CAUSED PORTSMOUTH LOTS OF 
PROBLEMS 
WE THOUGHT PORTSMOUTH PROBLEMS WERE GOING TO PLAY A FAST GAME AND 
HIT THEM ON THE BREAK THEY HAVE 
NOT DONE THAT AND CARDIFF HAVE READ 
THE SCRIPT AND SAT DEEPBEHIND THEM 
BECAUSE NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET 
BEHIND KANU THEY HAVE NOT BEEN 
ABLE TO HURT CARDIFF AT ALL APART 
FROM THE BALL WHICH WAS A MISTAKE 
I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH 
PORTSMOUTH BUT GOALS CHANGE GAMES 
AND IT IS A HUGELY ENTERTAINING 
MATCH 
THE GOAL FELL TO KANU YOU MATCH SAID IT WAS A MISTAKE MATCH FROM ENCKELMAN 
HE HAD A FUMBLE BEFORE ENCKELMAN AND KANU HAS MISSED AN UNBELIEVABLE 
CHANCE GREAT FEET THEY BREAK 
QUICKLY HERE DOWN THE RIGHT HAND 
SIDE CARDIFF HAVE GOT MEN BACK 
BUT WHEN THEY GET TO THE BYLINE 
THIS IS A GREAT BALL VERY 
DIFFICULT TO DEFEND AGAINST IT IS 
A MISTAKE AND KANU REACT VERY 
QUICKLY TO PUT IN THE BACK OF THAT 
BUT YOU WANT YOUR GOALKEEPER 
ULTIMATELY TO DO BETTER 
WE ARE 
GOING TO SEE A COUPLE OF DECISIONS 
HE HAS MADE HE TRIES TO CATCH THE 
MOST DIFFICULT ONE HE PUNCHES THE 
TWO WAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE 
HARD TO PUNCH A HALF VOLLEY HE HE TRIES TO CATCH MOST DIFFICULT ONE 
IF ANYTHING HE SHOULD BE PARRYING 
THAT ONE A FOREIGN GOALKEEPER 
WOULD THROW A FIST AT IT 
WE HAVE 
SEEN HIM PUNCH TOO EARLY HE GOT 
AWAY WITH THE FIRST ONE 
YOU FEEL 
SORRY FOR THE CENTRE HALF HE HAS 
GOT NO CHANCE WITH THAT 
LIKE YOU 
SAY IT CHANGES THE MATCH THE 
COMPLEXION OF THE GAME PORTSMOUTH PORTSMOUTH WERE DANGEROUS A COUPLE OF TIMES ON 
SIMILAR SITUATIONS 
THEY PLAYED A 
GREAT FREE KICK WE KEEP SAYING 
THIS IS DIFFICULT TO DEFEND AGAINST 
THE GREAT BALL IN BUT AGAIN WHAT 
WAS HE DOING THERE IT IS A FUMBLE 
THAT IS MY POINT IF ANYTHING YOU 
SHOULD BE CATCHING THAT ONE NOT 
DOING WHAT HE IS DOING YOU ARE 
RIGHT THAT IS NOTHING HE HAS GOT 
AWAY WITH IT 
I AM NOT SURE HE 
COULD HAVE PUNCHED IT WENT IT WAS A 
GOAL THIS IS ANOTHER ONE ANOTHER 
GOOD BALL IN THAT IS A PUNCH HE 
IS BEING DECISIVE THE BIG THING 
HERE AS FAR AS THE BACK FOUR IS 
CONCERNED IS THAT YOUR GOALKEEPER 
HAS GOT TO BE DECISIVE AND BEEN 
THE GOAL HE WASN'T IN THE END IT 
IS AN EASY CHANCE 
APART FROM THAT 
THE BACK FOUR HAVE NOT BEEN 
TROUBLED THE WAY THEY ARE PLAYING 
THEY ARE PLAYING DEEP 
AND HAS A 
BACK FOUR IF YOU GET YOUR MIDFIELD 
PLAYERS PLAYING AS HARD AS THEY CAN 
IN FRONT OF YOU GOT YOU CAN PLAY 
ALL DAY LONG 
DAVID JAMES HAS HAD 
HIS MOMENTS IN CUP FINALS HE GOT 
AWAY WITH ONE BEFORE HALF TIME WE WE HAVE SEEN HIM DO IT TWICE BEFORE 
HE COMES FOR IT MAKES A DECISION 
BUT THE PROBLEM IS HE DOESN'T GET 
TO IT WE WERE WANDERING AT FIRST 
WHAT THE REFEREE HAS GIVEN IT FOR 
HE HAS GIVEN IT FOR HANDBALL AND HE 
WAS RIGHT TOO BUT WHAT A FINISH 
THAT IS 
I DON'T THINK IT WAS ONE 
OF MINE 
IS QUITE CLEARLY IT IS 
HANDBALL AND THE REFEREE HAS GOT IT 
SPOT ON THE MISTAKE FROM JAMES HE 
SHOULD COME DOESN'T GET IT 
DESPERATELY UNLUCKY GOOD 
REFEREEING BUT DESPERATELY UNLUCKY 
IT MIGHT BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
WINNING AND LOSING 
WE SAW KANU PUT 
ONE AWAY BUT HE MISSED A SIMPLE 
ONE HAVING DONE SOME BRILLIANT WORK 
I HAVE SEEN HIM DO THIS MILLIONS OF 
TIMES IN TRAINING HE HAS GOT SUCH 
GOOD FEET WE SAW HIM SCORE GOAL 
AGAINST CHELSEA A FEW YEARS AGO 
THE FIRST TIME HE GOT BEHIND HIM 
GREAT FEET TO FITTED HE IS 
FALLING OVER AND THINGS I WILL 
SLOT IT IN FANTASTIC 
WHAT ABOUT 
THE REACTION 
SUPER FEET HE DOES THE DIFFICULT 
THINGS 
HE THINKS IT IS IN HE HAS 
GOT HIS ARM UP 
HERE COMES HARRY 
THERE IS MILD MADE TONY MY OLD 
MATE TONY THEY HAVE DONE EVER SO 
WELL NOT SWEARING ON T. V. AGHAST AGHAST AS FAR AS CARDIFF ARE CONCERNED 
THEY HAVE HAD A THREAT AND PARRY 
HAS CAUSED THEM PROBLEMS GETTING 
IN BEHIND THE DEFENCE 
I SAID 
BEFORE THE GAME BECAUSE SOL 
CAMPBELL HAS BEEN OUT FOR A WHILE 
THEY MIGHT USE IT TO THEIR 
ADVANTAGE PAUL PARRY IS PULLING 
OFF SOL CAMPBELL TIME AND TIME 
AGAIN DAVID JAMES GETS AWAY WITH 
IT THERE JUST HOLD IT THERE HE IS 
JUST IN BEHIND HIM SOL CAMPBELL 
DOESN'T KNOW WHERE HE IS HE HAS 
GOT HIS BACK TO THE PLAYER A 
DECENT BALL OVER DAVID JAMES BAILS 
HIM OUT THAT WAS AFTER THREE 
MINUTES THAT HAS BEEN THE TALE OF 
THE HALF FOR CARDIFF ANOTHER ONE 
YET AGAIN HE HAS GOT HIS BACK TO 
THE MAN DOESN'T KNOW WHERE HE IS 
IF PARRY TAKES A TOUCH AND GOES 
AROUND HIM BUT DISTIN IS NOT 
HELPING HIS MATE OUT HE IS TWO OR 
THREE YARDS BEHIND HIM L. AM NOT 
SURE CAMPBELL KNOWS WHERE HE IS IF 
HE GOES AROUND HIM I THINK HE 
SLOTS IT IN 
OR GETS A PENALTY IT IT IS OBVIOUSLY A TACTIC THEY HAVE 
WORKED ON CARDIFF 
HIT SOME BALLS 
BEHIND HIM 
LET'S TEST HIM AND SEE 
IF HE IS FIT HE HAS BEEN CAUGHT 
NAPPING TWO OR THREE TIMES AND BEEN 
FORTUNATE THERE TWO OR THREE 
YARDS BEHIND HIM THE LAST MAN IF 
HE TAKES A DECENT TOUCH PARRY HE 
IS IN LUCKILY FOR SOL CAMPBELL 
HIS PACE GETS AWAY WITH IT 
I THINK 
PARRY HAS DONE INCREDIBLY WELL 
APART FROM THE FINISHING ASPECT HE 
HAS TAKEN UP GREAT POSITIONS OFF 
CAMPBELL 
JIMMY IS JUST DROPPING CAMPBELL OFF 
THAT IS THE ONE GREAT TACTICS OFF FROM THE MANAGER HE HAS LEFT A 
RUNNER UP FRONT AND JIMMY IS A BIT 
DEEPER 
PARRY BROKE DOWN THE LEFT DEEPER AND YOU THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE HAD 
A SHOT 
HE HAS GOT INTO THE 
POSITION TIME AND AGAIN OR WHETHER 
IT IS A LACK OF CONFIDENCE 
COMPOSURE OR A LACK OF QUALITY A 
GREAT POSITION YOU HAVE GOT TO HIT 
IT AT NO STAGE DID HE LOOK LIKE HE 
WAS GOING TO HIT IT THAT IS A 
GREAT POSITION TO BE IN 
JUST A BIT 
HARD 
IF HE BELIEVES IN HIMSELF HE HARD HAS TO TAKE THE SECOND TOUCH INSIDE 
HE HAS TO BE THINKING ABOUT HITTING 
IT 
TO BE FAIR DISTIN DID WELL HE IT GOT HIS POSITION PERFECT 
ONCE HE 
LOOKS UP HE HAS TO BE THINKING 
GOAL NOT MANY OPTIONS IN THE 
MIDDLE 
THE SECOND TOUCH IF IT MIDDLE TAKES HIM IN DISTIN COMES AND HE 
HAS A BIG DECISION TO MAKE O. K. O. K. LET'S TAKE A BREATHER TWO BIG 
GAMES ALSO BEING PLAYED TODAY IN 
THE LEAGUE TWO SEMI FINAL PLAY OFF 
SECOND LEG ROCHDALE HAVE REACHED 
THE LEAGUE TWO PLAY OFF FINAL AFTER 
BEATING DARLINGTON ON PENALTIES 
DARLINGTON OPENED THE SCORING BUT 
ROCHDALE FOUGHT BACK TO FORCE EXTRA 
TIME DAVID PERKINS WAS SENT OFF 
JASON KENNEDY'S PENALTY WAS SAVED 
IN THE SHOOT OUT ROCHDALE WILL 
MEET STOCKPORT OR WYCOMBE FOR A 
PLACE IN LEAGUE ONE 
A BAD WEEK FOR RANGERS GOT WORSE 
FOUR MINUTES AFTER THE BREAK THEY 
WERE LEADING THROUGH CHRISTIAN 
DAILLY JUST BEFORE THE HALF HOUR 
THE MOTHERWELL GOALKEEPER GRAHAM 
SMITH WENT WALKABOUT THEY HAD 
SQUANDERED A CHANCE TO KILL THE 
GAME JUST AFTER THE BREAK DANIEL 
COUSIN WAS THROUGH BUT HE DROVE 
AGAINST THE KEEPER RANGERS PAID 
THE PRICE CHRIS PORTER LEVELLED 
WITH HIS EIGHTEENTH GOAL OF THE SEASON 
NOW RANGERS HAVE TO BEAT SAINT MIRREN 
ON MONDAY NIGHT TO GO LEVEL WITH 
CELTIC ON POINTS INTO THE LAST 
ROUND OF GAMES NEXT THURSDAY BUT 
WITH A WORSE GOAL DIFFERENCE CELTIC ARE BACK IN THE DRIVING SEAT 
COMING UP SOON EURO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT EURO EURO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT MY MONEY IS ON FRANCE I I SUPPORT SPAIN

PORTSMOUTH'S JERMAIN DEFOE IS CUP 
TIED HE IS TALKING TO RAY STUBBS 
WHAT'S A CONVERSATION IN THE 
PORTSMOUTH DRESSING ROOM NOTHING NOTHING BASICALLY JUST TO KEEP GOING 
REALLY WE HAVE DONE WELL IN THE 
FIRST HALF SOME SHAKY MOMENTS 
THEY ARE STRONG ON SET PIECES 
DON'T GIVE AWAY SILLY FREE KICKS 
KEEP IT GOING WE ARE PLAYING ROLE 
THE PORTSMOUTH BEND WENT UP WHEN 
KANU MISSED THAT CHANCE 
WE ARE 
PLAYING WELL HE IS SO RELAXED 
KANU IT WAS A TIGHT ANGLE BUT HE 
MADE A MESS OF IT 
CREDIT TO 
CARDIFF 
THEY ARE DOING O. K. YEAH YEAH THEY ARE A GOOD SIDE STRONG FROM 
SET PIECES WE CANNOT GIVE AWAY 
SILLY FREE KICKS KEEP IT GOING 
REALLY WE ARE WINNING JUST BE 
SENSIBLE 
IT IS TEMPTING TO GET SENSIBLE MORE PLAYERS UP FRONT ALONGSIDE 
KANU TO CLOSE THE GAME DOWN 
DEFINITELY BUT WHEN YOU'RE WINNING 
YOU HAVE TO BE SENSIBLE KEEP THE 
BALL WHEN PEDRO MENDES GETS ON IT 
HE WILL GET AS PLAYING THE SYSTEM 
FROM THE MANAGER IS REALLY GOOD WE 
GET GOOD POSSESSION KEEP IT GOING 
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
YOU CAN'T 
TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED BUT THE 
POMPEY FANS WILL GO CRAZY IF 
PORTSMOUTH WHEN THE CAB 
UNBELIEVABLE THEY HAVE BEEN 
FANTASTIC ALL SEASON 
WIN THE CUP 
I AM ENJOYING IT 
THANK YOU FOR 
TALKING TO US 
HE MUST HAVE MIXED EMOTIONS 
JERMAIN DEFOE HE HAS BEEN GOOD FOR 
PORTSMOUTH HE HAS SCORED A FEW BUT 
HE CANNOT PLAY IN THE BIG ONE 
NOTHING WORSE 
MUST BE DIFFICULT A 
THREAT AT TIMES FROM SET PIECES 
CARDIFF AS JERMAIN DEFOE MENTIONED 
YEAH THEY HAVE PETER WHITTINGHAM 
HAS GOT 
GREAT DELIVERY ON THE LEFT 
HAS GOT GREAT DELIVERY ON THE LEFT PARRY OFF THE TRAINING GROUND 
NOBODY MARKING HE WAS FREE HE 
SHOULD DO BETTER THAN THAT IT CAME 
ACROSS TOO QUICK FOR HIM GREAT GREAT MOVEMENT BUT AGAIN JUST THE 
FINISH 
THIS ONE JOHNSON SEVEN FINISH GOALS THIS SEASON BEATS EVERYBODY 
IF YOU WAIT IN A BALL LIKE THAT 
GARY AS YOU KNOW IT IS SO 
DIFFICULT TO DEFEND AGAINST THAT 
IS HOW TIGHT IT CAN BE IF THE BALL 
IS GOOD ENOUGH 
HARRY REDKNAPP'S FORTY FIVE 
MINUTES AWAY POSSIBLY FROM HIS 
FIRST MAJOR TROPHY WHAT WILL HE BE 
SAYING TO HIS PLAYERS 
THEY HAVE 
DONE THE FIRST PART THEY HAVE TO 
DEFEND FOR THEIR LIVES NOW CARDIFF 
I AM NOT SURE HOW LONG THEY WILL 
GIVE IT THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES THE 
GAPS WILL APPEAR FOR PORTSMOUTH TO 
PUSH FORWARD IF IT IS THE SAME 
CARDIFF HAVE TO DO THE SAME AS THE 
FIRST HALF L. HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED 
TACTICALLY THEY HAVE GOT IT SPOT 
ON 
TWENTY ONE TIMES PORTSMOUTH HAVE LED ON THIS SEASON AND THEY HAVE HELD ON 
EVERY TIME 
THEY HAVE GOT TO DO 
SOMETHING THE LAD RAMSEY SEVENTEEN 
YEAR OLD WUNDERKIND L. AM PRETTY 
SURE WE WILL SEE HIM AT SOME POINT 
WHETHER HE CAN TURN IT AROUND 
DAVID JONES WILL KEEP IT THE SAME 
MORE CHANCES TO COME FOR CARDIFF 
IT IS JUST CASE OF SHOWING 
COMPOSURE IN FRONT OF GOAL BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE CERTAINLY HAD THE CHANCES 
AS FOR PORTSMOUTH THEY ARE IN POLE 
POSITION IT IS FOR THEM TO LOSE 
NOW CARDIFF HAVE TO COME BACK AT 
THEM THERE WILL BE GAPS APPEARING 
IN THE LAST TWENTY MINUTES BUT WE JUST 
HOPE IT IS AS GOOD IN THE SECOND 
HALF AS IT WAS IN THE FIRST 
CARDIFF PLAYERS ARE ON THE PITCH 
PORTSMOUTH ARE JUST LEAVING THE 
TUNNEL BACK TO MARK LAWRENSON AND 
JOHN MOTSON NO CHANGES BY EITHER SIDE AT HALF 
TIME PORTSMOUTH HAVE MILAN BAROS 
DAVID NUGENT NOE PAMAROT PAPA 
BOUBA DIOP AND GOALKEEPER DAMIE 
ASHDOWN JAMIE ASHDOWN CARDIFF 
AARON RAMSEY SEVENTEEN DARREN PURSE THE 
CLUB CAPTAIN STEVE THOMPSON OFTEN 
COMES ON UP FRONT TREVOR SINCLAIR 
THE VETERAN AND GOALKEEPER MICHAEL 
OAKES THEY ARE THE CHOICES OPEN TO 
HARRY REDKNAPP AND DAVID JONES 
JUST A POINT ABOUT THE TWO MANAGERS 
THE FIRST TIME I BELIEVE SINCE 
NINETEEN NINETY ONE THAT BOTH MANAGERS IN THE F. A. 
CUP FINAL ARE ENGLISH DAVID JONES 
A LIVERPUDLIAN PLAYED FOR EVERTON 
AND WE ALL KNOW WHERE HARRY CAME 
FROM IN FACT THE LAST ENGLISH 
MANAGER TO WIN THE F. A. CUP JOE 
ROYLE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE ONE OF THEM HAS GOT 
TO DO IT TODAY IT'S CARDIFF CITY 
IN THE BLACK STRIP TO START THE 
SECOND HALF PLAYING FROM THE RIGHT PLAY UP POMPEY GLEN JOHNSON HAS HAD HIS HANDS FULL WITH LEDLEY ROGER JOHNSON TROTTING UP TO THE SIX YARD LINE TO BE MARKED BY KANU VERY MUCH THE ENERGY IN THE CARDIFF 
MIDFIELD GAVIN RAE A BOX TO BOX 
PLAYER WHO CAME FROM RANGERS BLUE ARMY DIARRA SHOWED SOME NICE TOUCHES IN 
THE F. A. STAFF PLAYING IN RATHER 
MORE ADVANCED DECISION THAN HE DID 
IN THE FIRST SEMI FINAL LASSANA 
DIARRA FIRST HALF A FREE KICK TO CARDIFF RAE WAS FOULED CHANGE OF THE BALL JOHN YES MIKE 
DEAN IS NOT HAPPY WITH THAT NO NO DISCERNIBLE CHANGES TACTICALLY AT 
THE START OF THE SECOND HALF THEY ARE CALLING THIS THE FANS 
FINAL STILL PLENTY OF THEM IN THE 
BAR AT HALF TIME HE HAS GOT A FREE KICK JUST WAITING FOR HERMANN 
HREIDARSSON SOL CAMPBELL HAS 
STAYED BACK GIVEN AWAY BY GLEN JOHNSON CAPALDI GLENN LOOVENS WHAT A CLEVER PLAYER HE CAN BE JOE LEDLEY 
HE HAS GIVEN UP JOHNSON LEDLEY SOME PROBLEMS TODAY JOHNSON IT 
GIVES ROGER JOHNSON THE CHANCE TO 
MOVE FORWARD AGAIN IN THE 
PORTSMOUTH PENALTY BOX GLENN 
LOOVENS GOES WITH HIM WHITTINGHAM 
TO TAKE IT OUT COMES ROGER JOHNSON THE 
ASSISTANT REFEREE SAYS GOAL KICK 
JOHNSON IS CLAIMING A CORNER AND A 
GREAT BALL IN IT WAS A CORNER IT 
CAME OFF SOL CAMPBELL ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY UNLUCKY FOR CARDIFF'S ROGER 
JOHNSON IS BACK IN DEFENCE 
CARDIFF BAY HE GETS A FREE KICK 
AND AN INJURY CARDIFF 
THAT DOES 
HURT PETER ENCKELMAN UP LOOKING FOR JOE 
LEDLEY AND FAILED PETER 
ENCKELMAN LASSANA DIARRA IS 
PLAYING AS WELL AS ANYBODY 
HE HAS 
BEEN VERY GOOD 
MICK NAUGHTON 
CHARGING FORWARD HERE COMES HASSELBAINK WE HAVE NOT 
SEEN TOO MUCH OF HIM 
BECAUSE HE 
KEEPS FALLING OVER AFTER EVERY 
TOUCH 
KANU ONCE IT FIRST GONE OUT TOUCH FOR A CORNER ONCE IT CORREA 
ONCE IT 
GOOD PLAY BY PORTSMOUTH 
A 
A CORNER TO PORTSMOUTH SOL CAMPBELL IS FORWARD FOR THIS 
SULLEY MUNTARI COMES FORWARD TO 
TAKE IT PETER ENCKELMAN HAS FOUND JIMMY 
FLOYD HASSELBAINK WHITTINGHAM HE 
HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL HE HAS GOT A 
YELLOW CARD 
KRANJCAR SO HE HAS ALSO GOT 
YELLOW CARD NOW 
HE MADE NO ATTEMPT 
TO PLAY THE BALL 
IT DID HE HERE HERE IT IS GLENN LOOVENS DID HE YOU HAD PLAYERS LEFT AND RIGHT THAT IT WAS GOOD PLAY FOR PORTSMOUTH IF 
THEY HAD KEPT THE BALL BUT IT IS 
CARDIFF INSTEAD 
MENDEZ JOHN UTAKA KANIA IN 
THE CENTRE AT THE MOMENT THE OTHER 
HAS SLOWED TO GET FORWARD KANU 
HE JUST NEEDED TO WAIT BIT LONGER 
GOOD PLAY THERE IT IS A FREE KICK 
SUDDENLY COME INTO THE GAME NIKO 
KRANJCAR SCORED HERE FOR CROATIA 
SOME OF US WOULD NOT WANT TO BE 
REMINDED ABOUT THAT THAT WAS 
AGAINST ENGLAND 
TOO LATE 
HE ALSO 
SCORED AGAINST SCOTLAND A FREE 
KICK FOR PORTSMOUTH AND HERE IS 
MENDERS JOHNSON MENDEZ KANU 
COMING UP NEAR POST CORNER I THINK THAT IS A GOAL KICK OR A 
FREE KICK NOT A CORNER SOL SOL CAMPBELL COMES FORWARD AND HERMANN 
HREIDARSSON HREIDARSSON ALWAYS IN CONTROL OF THE SITUATION 
GOOD LEFT FOOT SULLEY MUNTARI 
JUST WONDER HOW LONG JIMMY FLOYD 
HASSELBAINK WILL LAST IN THIS GAME 
YOU ALSO HAVE A RAMSEY AND THE BOY 
WONDER WHO CAN PLAY IN ANY POSITION 
THE BOY WONDER RAMSEY IT IS RUSSIA MACRO FOUR PORTSMOUTH 
NIKO KRANJCAR 
THE GAME HAS OPENED 
UP I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE 
GOALS 
SULLEY MUNTARI GOALS GOALS HREIDARSSON HAS MADE A FORWARD RUN 
HE HAS GOT SUPPORT FROM MENDEZ 
GLEN JOHNSON LASSANA HAS 
BEEN ROCKED BY WHITTINGHAM FREE 
KICK TO CARDIFF 
PAUL PARRY WAS 
TRYING TO MAKE A RUN IN BUT NOBODY 
SAW HIM THIS IS JOHN UTAKA KANU IS IN THE 
MIDDLE A BIT OF SUPPORT COMING 
FORWARD NOW 
HE HAD A TOUCH TOO 
MANY JOHN UTAKA IS INJURED NEARLY AN HOUR WHAT DO YOU SEE AS 
THE FLOW OF THE GAME PORTSMOUTH 
LOOKING FOR A SECOND 
IT HAS REALLY 
OPENED NOW A A BIT OF A DANGEROUS 
SITUATION FOR CARDIFF NOW YOU 
FEEL THAT IT MIGHT PUT PORTSMOUTH 
OFF THE KEY FOR DAVID JONES IS TO 
GET THE SUBSTITUTIONS RIGHT CARDIFF HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP 
THEIR NEW STADIUM THIS IS THE BOY 
THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALLAN 
RAMSEY LEFT SCHOOL LAST SUMMER 
YOUNGEST EVER PLAYER FOR CARDIFF 
CITY AARON RAMSEY 
HE IS A REAL 
TALENT 
THAT IS A FREE KICK AGAINST TALENT SULLEY MUNTARI FORWARD BY GLENN LOOVENS 
OFFSIDE PAUL PARRY JONES 
MAKES THE FIRST CHANGE PETER 
WHITTINGHAM IS GOING OFF AARON 
RAMSEY IS THE MAN TO COME ON A 
ONLY TWENTY FOUR DAYS OLDER THAN CURTIS 
WESTERNER WHO BECAME THE YOUNGEST 
CUP FINALIST FOR MILLWALL 
HE CAN 
PLAY IN ANY POSITION YOU NAME IT MILLWALL GOT TO THE CUP FINAL 
AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED STOMACH 
NO INJURY AGAINST WHITTINGHAM IT 
WAS A TACTICAL MOVE BY DAVID JONES MENDEZ FOR PORTSMOUTH THIS IS GLEN JOHNSON JOHN UTAKA HE ONLY LEFT SCHOOL A YEAR AGO 
AARON RAMSEY HE HAS JUST BEEN BACK 
THERE HERE IS MENDEZ ACROSS TO 
HERMANN HREIDARSSON SYLVAIN DISTIN 
JOHNSON KANU WANTS IT PLAYED EARLY 
IT WILL BE NOW ROGER JOHNSON IN 
SUPPORT PORTSMOUTH CANNOT REALLY 
PLAY THROUGH THEM AT THE MOMENT AND THEY DO HAVE THE GREATEST SHARE OF THE BALL PORTSMOUTH PORTSMOUTH WHO HAVE ONLY CONCEDED 
JUST THAT ONE GOAL THAT WAS TO 
PLYMOUTH IN THEIR RUN TO THE FINAL FREE KICK RAMSEY'S WON IT HAVING 
JUST COME ON 
NO FEAR THAT LAD NO NO HE PLAYED AS A RIGHT BACK IN THE 
SEMI FINAL IF I REMEMBER VERY 
VERSATILE CARDIFF JUST PUSHING PORTSMOUTH BACK BIT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THOMSON FOR 
HASSELBAINK WOULD HAVE BEEN THE 
NEXT DAVID JONES CHANGED 
I WOULD 
HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IMMINENT 
CHANGE HE KEEPS HAVING A LOOK JIMMY WAITING FOR THE NUMBER TO COME UP JUST A LITTLE WORD IN HIS EAR AND 
HE SAID NOT YET HASSELBAINK HASSELBAINK STILL VERY MUCH IN THE THICK OF IT 
FOR THE MOMENT JUST WONDER WHETHER PORTSMOUTH 
MIGHT OVERSTRETCH IN GOING FOR THE 
SECOND GOAL 
THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE 
A SUBSTITUTION AS WELL VERY 
SHORTLY MCPHAIL WAS LOOKING FOR OR PARRY I 
THINK IT NUGENT MIGHT BE COMING ON 
DAVID NUGENT WHO SCORED THE WINNER 
IN THE THIRD ROUND AGAINST IPSWICH 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT IS UTAKA THE THE INTERESTING THING TO SEE NOW 
WHETHER NUGENT PLAYS DOWN THE RIGHT 
OR THEY STICK HIM THROUGH THE 
MIDDLE I SUGGEST HE WILL PROBABLY 
PLAY DOWN THE RIGHT 
DAVID NUGENT 
WHO WASN'T A GREAT SUCCESS WHEN HE 
FIRST CAME TO PORTSMOUTH WAS HE 
MARK 
A LOT OF PORTSMOUTH FANS WILL MARK TELL YOU HE STILL ISN'T HE IS 
STILL LEARNING THE GAME MIND CAME CAME FROM PRESTON OF COURSE HE HAS 
GONE TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AS YOU 
SAID 
I DON'T THINK LEADING THE SAID CUP FINAL ONE TO ZERO YOU'RE GOING TO 
COMMIT ANOTHER MAN FORWARD ARE 
YOU NO GLANCEY HAS COME ACROSS TO THE LEFT 
FOR CARDIFF RAMSEY LEDLEY HAS 
GONE RIGHT 
NUGENT WILL RUN ALL DAY 
FOR YOU AND CHASE ABSOLUTELY 
EVERYTHING CAMPBELL COMES OVER NUGENT GETS A FREE KICK FOR A FOUL BY RAE AND NOW WITH THE SUBSTITUTION WE 
PREDICTED THOMPSON COMING ON FOR 
HASSELBAINK STEVEN THOMPSON A SCOTTISH TARGET 
MAN A BIT UNPREDICTABLE IN FACT 
SO UNPREDICTABLE HE INJURED HIMSELF 
FALLING OFF BANANA BOAT IN THE 
UNITED STATES BEFORE THE SEASON 
BEGAN THERE'S ONE FOR YOU EVEN 
YOU COULD NOT RESPOND TO THAT 
THANK YOU 
HE WAS THE MAN WHO WAS 
DONE THIS SONG IN OUR BUILD UP ON 
THE CARDIFF PLAYERS DOING THE 
SONG INTO THE LAST TWENTY MINUTES NUGENT WOW IT WAS WORTH A TRY DID 
ENCKELMAN SAY THAT OR DID IT HIT 
THE POST SAVED THAT 
IT WAS 
GOING IN 
HREIDARSSON HAS COME TO JOIN CAMPBELL AND GLEN JOHNSON JOHNSON GOT UP AS WELL IF HREIDARSSON HAD HAD HIS FORWARD 
HEAD ON HE WAS THINKING AS A 
DEFENDER HE GOT CAUGHT ON HIS 
HEELS IF HE HAD GAMBLED HE MIGHT 
HAVE GOT ON THE END OF JOHNSON'S 
NOT BACK WORTH AN EFFORT ISN'T IT 
KNOCK BACK JUST NEED A SPELL OF POSSESSION 
CARDIFF TO BUILD SOME CONFIDENCE 
AND START TO BUILD UP THE PRESSURE JOE LEDLEY WITH THE SHOT IT HAS 
GOT TO BE SOME SORT OF STRIKE TO 
BEAT DAVID JAMES FROM THERE RAMSEY 
WANTED THE BALL BACK HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN BETTER GIVING IT HIM BACK JOE 
LEDLEY POSITIVE CHANGES THOUGH BY DAVID JONES 
YES WELL COMING TOWARDS JONES THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE SECOND 
HALF IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT 
CARDIFF HAVE DONE THEMSELVES PRETTY 
PROUD AS A CHAMPIONSHIP SIDE BUT 
THEY HAVE NOT QUITE YET FOUND THE 
THRUST TORY TO CONCERN DISTIN AND 
CAMPBELL FREE KICK A FOUL ON LOOVENS WELL RAMSEY PLAYING WIDE RIGHT 
FOR CARDIFF THOMPSON DOWN THE 
MIDDLE WITH PARRY A MISTAKE BY GLEN JOHNSON AND HE'S 
MADE UP FOR IT AT THE EXPENSE OF A 
CORNER FOR CARDIFF LOOVENS AND JOHNSON ON THEIR WAY 
FORWARD AGAIN THOMPSON IS IN THERE 
THIS TIME OF COURSE JOHNSON HE CERTAINLY WINS HIS FAIR SHARE OF HEADERS YES HE TAKES A RUNNING JUMP 
CLIMBS ABOVE TWO DEFENDERS MOST OF 
THE TIME 
IT IS THE TONY ADAMS 
COACHING YOU SEE GOOD MOVEMENT BUT A POOR PASS THAT 
WAS RAMSEY UNUSUAL FOR HIM 
BECAUSE HE LOVES TO RUN WITH THE 
BALL HE GOT IN A POSITION TO GO 
FORWARD AND COMMIT PEOPLE DAVE JONES NOW KNOWS FIFTEEN MINUTES TO FORCE EXTRA TIME SO A CHANCE FOR A LONG CAPALDI THROW IN KRANJCAR GOT IT AWAY FOR PORTSMOUTH THOMPSON THIS IS A GOOD SPELL FOR CARDIFF FINALLY GLEN JOHNSON GLAD TO GET 
THE BALL BACK INTO THE CARDIFF HALF 
THAT SPELL OF CARDIFF PRESSURE 
THERE WAS A BIG HEADER BY SOL 
CAMPBELL NOW THEN PAPA BOUBA DIOP WHO WAS 
LEFT OUT OF THE STARTING LINE UP 
WILL GET A CHANCE TO STIFFEN UP THE 
PORTSMOUTH MIDFIELD SO THE SENEGALESE PLAYER WHO IS 
YET TO SCORE FOR PORTSMOUTH 
ALTHOUGH HE WAS THE PLAYER SO WE 
ARE TOLD BY THE STATISTICS PEOPLE 
WHO HAD THE MOST SHOTS IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE SEASON WITHOUT 
SCORING HE'S POPULAR THE CROSS IS CLEARED BY DISTIN FOR A CORNER RAMSAY HAS GONE ACROSS TO TAKE IT THOMPSON WAS JUMPING AND COMING IN 
BEHIND HIM LOOVENS AGAIN 
I THINK 
THE PROBLEM IS THEIR HEADER INTO 
THE GROUND RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM 
BUT YET AGAIN A CARDIFF HEAD ON A 
BALL FROM A SET PIECE DANGEROUS 
OBVIOUSLY FOR PORTSMOUTH THE ATTENDANCE IS EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND GOT EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR 
EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THAT IS AS BIG IT GETS 
IN THIS STADIUM PORTSMOUTH STILL 
LEAD BY KANU'S GOAL THOMSON IS BEGINNING TO MAKE A NUISANCE OF HIMSELF UP THERE NOW FREE KICK THERE IS ROBBIE FOWLER TONY ADAMS 
WAS SAYING TO THEM DEFENSIVELY 
TRY AND HOLD THE LINE KEEP IT 
PUSHED UP A LITTLE BIT DON'T DROP 
DEEP ROBBIE FOWLER HAS BEEN OUT 
WITH A HIP INJURY SINCE THE TURN OF 
THE YEAR SO IT WAS PUSHING IT TO 
GET HIM ON THE BENCH TODAY THAT IS GOOD DEFENDING BY JOHNSON 
HE GOT HIS BODY BETWEEN THE BALL 
AND DEMAND THE MAN IT HAS BEEN A GOOD BATTLE THAT A 
CONVERSATION BETWEEN DAVID JONES 
AND HIS ASSISTANT ON THE RIGHT 
COLOUR AND HARRY REDKNAPP ON THE 
LEFT THEY HAVE BOTH GOT A BIT OF 
WORK TO DO ON THE RIGHT LATE 
ADJUSTMENTS MIGHT MAKE THE COURSE 
OF THIS GAME CHANGED CHANGE PAPA BOUBA DIOP IS FLAGGED FOR A 
FOUL DON'T RULE CARDIFF CITY OUT 
YOU ALWAYS FEEL IN GAMES LIKE THESE 
THE TEAM THAT IS CHASING THE GAME 
ALWAYS GETS A CHANCE ALWAYS THE CORNER FLAG TAKES A HIT AFRICA CARDIFF A THROW TO CARDIFF IT IS LEFT 
FOR CAPALDI EVERYBODY IS BACK FOR 
PORTSMOUTH OUTCOMES THEY HAD FROM CAMPBELL 
AGAIN AND KRANJCAR COULD START 
SOMETHING OR PORTSMOUTH OUTCOMES PUSHING GOOD PLAY BY 
MCNAUGHTON AGAIN HE GOT HIS BODY 
BETWEEN THE MAN AND THE BALL THE THE PHYSIO WAS QUICKLY COMING DOWN THE 
LINE HE 
IS A STEADY CUSTOMER 
HE HE IS ONLY ABOUT TWENTY SIX ISN'T HE HE IS 
THE SCOTTISH INTERNATIONAL WHO IS 
PLAYING IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP HAVING 
BEEN AT ABERDEEN PORTSMOUTH HAVE POSSESSION SO PLAYGOERS ON PLAY GOES ON DISTIN WHAT A GOAL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
IT IS A GREAT TACKLE AS WELL BEEN IT WAS A BRILLIANT RUN BY DISTIN 
WHEN HE FIRST GOT IT HE DID NOT 
HAVE TOO MANY OPTIONS BUT IT IS A 
BRILLIANT TACKLE IN THE END 
IT WAS 
ROGER JOHNSON WHO MADE THE 
CHALLENGE BUT WHAT A THRILLING RUN 
FROM A CENTRE BACK AS THINGS STAND PORTSMOUTH ARE 
FIVE MINUTES PLUS STOPPAGE TIME 
AWAY FROM WINNING THE F. A. CUP THE 
OFFSIDE FLAG IS UP ANOTHER ATTACKER COMING ON IT IS 
IT MILAN BAROS 
IT MUST BE FOR 
KANU CARDIFF HAVE GOT TO GET IT FORWARD NOW 
IT 
WILL BE BAROS FOR KANU THAT THAT WILL ENABLE PORTSMOUTH TO GO A 
LITTLE BIT LONGER SINCLAIR IS 
ABOUT TO COME ON FOR CARDIFF CITY 
FOR GAVIN RAE I THINK TREVOR SINCLAIR WHO PLAYED WE 
ARE LOOKING AT KANU TREVOR 
SINCLAIR PLAYED IN THE TWO THOUSAND TWO WORLD 
CUP FOR ENGLAND UNDER SVEN GORAN 
ERIKSSON BAROS HAS COME ON WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
FOR PAPA BOUBA DIOP BAROS WILL 
PLAY THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND LEAVE 
NUGENT ON THE RIGHT 
MILAN BAROS 
WHO HAD A HAND LITERALLY IN THE 
WINNING GOAL IN THE SEMI FINAL BUT 
HE IS YET TO SCORE ONE FOR 
PORTSMOUTH THIS WAS TODAY'S GOAL 
KANU WHO HAS JUST GONE OFF THE 
ONLY GOAL OF THE GAME SO FAR IT IS HIS FIRST TOUCH ISN'T IT 
THE THING ABOUT PORTSMOUTH IS 
DIARRA IS NOT IN THAT ATTACKING 
ROLE ANY MORE HE IS SAT IN FRONT 
OF THE BACK FOUR WHERE MENDES WAS 
AND IT IS ALMOST FOUR ONE FOUR TO FOURTEEN 
PORTSMOUTH THERE IS THE ENGRAVER OR RATHER 
HIS PENCIL HE HASN'T STARTED 
COLLECTING YET WILL IT BE THE NAME 
OF PORTSMOUTH FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY NINE CAN CARDIFF CITY 
PRODUCE SOMETHING NOW IN THE LAST 
COUPLE OF MINUTES IT WAS A LET OFF FOR POMPEY BUT LOOK AT THE BREAK I REALLY THOUGHT YOUNG AARON RAMSEY 
MIGHT HAVE PULLED IT OUT OF THE 
FIRE FOR CARDIFF THERE BAROS HAS 
FORCED A CORNER AND PAUL SMITH 
BREATHER FIGHT A SIGH OF RELIEF 
PAUL SMITH GREECE PORTSMOUTH BREEZE ON THE SECOND 
ONE IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS GOING TO 
SHOOT AND HE PLAYED MCNAUGHTON BACK 
IN 
THEY WILL BE FOUR MINUTES ADDED IN WHEN WE REACHED THE NINETIETH MINUTE SO 
THE PREMATURE CELEBRATIONS MAY HAVE 
TO WAIT A WHILE PAPA BOUBA DIOP FORCES ANOTHER 
CORNER MCNAUGHTON IS STILL MAKING 
HIS WAY BACK BUT THEY HAVE USED 
THEIR THREE SUBSTITUTES CARDIFF HAVE GOT A CHANCE TO GET 
THE BALL UPFIELD 
THEY HAVE TO 
LEAVE MCNAUGHTON UP HE CANNOT RUN IF THEY FORCE EXTRA TIME THEY WILL BE PLAYING IT WITH TEN MEN HARRY REDKNAPP IS FOUR MINUTES AWAY 
FROM WINNING THE F. A. CUP FOR THE 
FIRST TIME AS A MANAGER THEY ARE GETTING READY TO ROAR 
THEIR TEAM HOME BUT CARDIFF CITY 
MAY STILL HAVE A SAY STILL TESTING 
THAT PORTSMOUTH DEFENCE EXCEPT FOR 
MCNAUGHTON WHO CANNOT RUN AT ALL 
HE IS IN SOME DISTRESS SINCLAIR 
WILL LEAVE THE THROW FOR CAPALDI 
AGAIN WE HAVE GOT ROGER JOHNSON IN 
THE PENALTY AREA THOMPSON AS WELL I THINK DISTIN AND CAMPBELL HAVE 
BEEN EXCELLENT FOR THE LAST TWENTY 
MINUTES OF THE GAME THEY HAVE GOT 
THEIR HEADS ON ABSOLUTELY 
EVERYTHING THAT HAS COME IN FREE KICK A CHANCE FOR PAUL SMITH TO RUN THE 
CLOCK DOWN L. IMAGINE THEY WILL 
STICK IT IN THE CORNER FOR NUGENT 
AND BAROS TO CHASE PORTSMOUTH 
THEY ARE SO CLOSE NOW HARRY REDKNAPP THE CROWNING MOMENT IN HIS LONG MANAGERIAL CAREER A BIG MOMENT FOR THEM TOO THE MAN OF THE MATCH AT KANU DID 
YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
IT SOUNDS LIKE 
THE SPONSORED VOTED FOR IT HE 
SCORED THE GOAL IT IS A DAFT FOUL 
BY DIARRA 
A YELLOW CARD AS WELL 
CARDIFF HAVE A CHANCE TO PUSH 
PORTSMOUTH BACK WITH A MINUTE TO GO 
THE GOALKEEPER IS COMING UP WHAT A 
FINISH THIS COULD BE TO THE SECOND 
HALF IT HAS COME OUT TO RAMSEY AND WHAT 
A BLOCK FROM ROGER JOHNSON 
CORNER TO BE TAKEN BY RAMSEY A BIG 
FINISH BY CARDIFF OVER THE HEAD OF 
ROGER JOHNSON SECONDS TO GO AS 
DAVID JAMES SECONDS TO GO OUT 
TO GO OUT AND PORTSMOUTH HAVE WON 
THAT THE F. A. CUP FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AND HARRY REDKNAPP HAS 
LED THEM INTO EUROPE FOR THE FIRST 
TIME HARRY REDKNAPP WILL RULES THE 
WAVES IN PORTSMOUTH AND RULES

MORE THAN THAT HE HAS TAKEN THEM 
TO THE F. A. CUP FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN THE CAPTAIN IS LEADING 
THE SIDE A FEW DISAPPOINTED FACES 
AMONG AT THE WELSH BUT I THINK THEY

TEAM DID WELL IT IS AN ANTI CLIMAX 
AT THE END BUT I THINK WITH A NEW 
STADIUM THE CHAIRMAN WILL BE 
PLEASED WITH A WEALTH THIS WITH 
THE WAY THIS SEASON HAS ENDED UNDER 
DAVID JONES HAS THE PLAYERS WILL 
EMERGE AGAIN TO COLLECT THEIR 
MEDALS DAVE JONES 
CARDIFF HAVE DONE REALLY WELL THEY

THEY RAN OUT OF IDEAS ABOUT A L. L. 
THINK EVERYBODY WANTED HARRY 
REDKNAPP TO WIN THIS TROPHY BOBBY BOBBY ROBSON PRESENTING THE TROPHY IS 
WITH HIS WIFE 
AT ONE 
SIDE AND THE 
F. A. CUP CHAIRMAN ON THE OTHER THE 
TROPHY PETER ENCKELMAN MADE SOME 
GOOD SAVES OR CARDIFF CITY WERE A 
LONG WAY FROM THIS A YEAR AGO THAT 
IS THE VETERAN TREVOR SINCLAIR 
THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD PLAYER IN JOE 
LEDLEY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS 
PORTSMOUTH ARE ON THEIR WAY OFF 
ARE ON THEIR WAY THAT IS THE 
RESERVE GOALKEEPER WHOSE FATHER WON 
A MEDAL HERE L. THOUGHT GLENN 
LOOVENS PLAYED EXTREMELY WELL FOR 
CARDIFF AT THE BACK 
FOR AND IT 
JOHNSON BOTH OF THEM WERE VERY 
GOOD AND JOHNSON'S THIS FEELS 
SO GOOD WHEN YOU KNOW YOU ARE GOING 
TO LIFT THE CUP JOHNSON SOL SOL CAMPBELL AS CAPTAIN IT WILL BE THE 
FIRST MAN UP WILL BE THE SECOND 
FINAL AT THE REBUILT WEMBLEY AND 
IT WAS A REFRESHING CHANGE 
IT WAS 
A VERY GOOD GAME OF FALL OF CHANCES 
FULL OF GOOD PLAY AND IT HAS BEEN A 
FANTASTIC DAY L. FEEL LIKE THE 
ATMOSPHERE IS BACK IN THIS FINAL 
THE SUPPORTERS DID THEMSELVES PROUD 
JUST UNDER NINETY THOUSAND HERE SOL 
CAMPBELL HAD F. A. CUP WINNING 
EXPERIENCE WITH ARSENAL HE WILL 
COLLECT THE TROPHY FOR PORTSMOUTH 
WHAT A MOMENT FOR SOL CAMPBELL 
PARTICULARLY TO RECEIVE IT FROM THE 
MANAGER WHO WON IT HERE THIRTY YEARS

POMPEY CHIMES BEEN HEARD LOUDER IN 
RECENT YEARS 
DAVID JAMES AND SYLVAIN DISTIN 
THEY BROUGHT EXPERIENCED OF 
PORTSMOUTH THEY BROUGHT 
EXPERIENCED TO PORTSMOUTH 
EXPERIENCE MENDEZ DID A GOOD JOB 
WERE THE WINNERS 
I THINK SO ON THE 
DAYTHEY WERE NERVOUS AT FIRST AND 
CARDIFF WERE THE BETTER TEAM UP 
UNTIL KANU SCORED THE BETTER 
TEAM AT BUT GOALS CHANGE GAMES 
HULL CITY 
IT WILL BE THE FIRST 
TIME A EUROPEAN FOOTBALL HAS BEEN 
PLAYED AT FRATTON PARK THAT IS THE 
ACHIEVEMENT OF HARRY REDKNAPP 
EUROPEAN FOOTBALL AND THEY WILL 
PLAY IN THE COMMUNITY SHIELD 
AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED GOOD 
TIMES ON THE SOUTH COAST AND THE 
CELEBRATIONS WILL CONTINUE FOR A 
LONG TIME WHEN THEY HAVE WAITED 
UNTIL BEFORE THE WAR THEY ARE 
ENTITLED TO ENJOY THE MOMENT THEIR 
BEST LEAGUE POSITION SINCE THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE STARTED EIGHT AND 
THE F. A. CUP TO GO WITH IT EIGHT F. T. 
EIGHT POSITION 
WE SHOULD NOT FORGET CARDIFF DAVID 
JAMES HAS HAD A FEW WORDS TO SAY 
YOUR TEAM AND DID YOU PROUD 
DAVID JONES WE GAVE IT EVERYTHING 
WE HAD AND THAT IS ALL YOU CAN ASK 
WE DID EVERYBODY CROWD WHATEVER 
YOUR NATIONALITY WHATEVER WE DID 
WHAT WE DID PROVE TO OTHER TEAMS 
CAN CHOICE OF 
WHAT CAN ACHIEVE WHAT YOU DO NOT THINK IS POSSIBLE 
IT HAS BEEN A GREAT OCCASION 
I AM 
VERY PROUD OF MY PLAYERS NOT OF 
EVERYTHING GOING ON AT THE 
SUPPORTERS WERE MAGNIFICENT AND I 
AM SORRY WE COULD NOT SEE IT 
THROUGH FOR THEM 
IT LOOKED LIKE HE 
MIGHT GET AN EQUALISER 
IT WAS 
ALWAYS A TIGHT GAME WE HAD A GOOD 
CHANCE IN THE FIRST HALF THERE IS 
NO ONE TO BLAME WE HAVE HAD A 
FANTASTIC DAY BUT IT IS HARD WHEN 
YOU LOSE 
THIS COULD BE THE 
SPRINGBOARD FOR CARDIFF TO GO ON TO 
GREATER THINGS 
IT HAS TO BE AND 
WE HAVE STRUGGLED FOR THREE YEARS 
NO MONEY FOR TWO YEARS WE HAVE A NEW 
STADIUM IT NEW TRAINING FACILITIES 
THE NEXT STAGE IS TO COMPETE WITH 
OUR OWN IT DIVISION IN OUT WE WE UNDERSTAND YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT BUT 
CAN YOU SAY WHAT EMOTIONS YOU HAVE 
EXPERIENCED 
TODAY YOU THINK YOU EXPERIENCED HAVE SCORED AND THEN YOU THINK YOU 
HAVE NOT AND THEN THAT THEY SCORE 
AND YOUR HEART SINKS BUT YOU PICK 
YOURSELF UP AND FOR A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CLUB TO COME HERE AND GIVE 
PORTSMOUTH A FRIGHT THERE ARE THE 
ONES WHO ARE CHANGING AND HOLDING 
ON THAT AND HOLDING ON IT WE 
MUST HAVE BEEN DOING SOMETHING 
RIGHT THIS YEAR 
EVERYBODY AT 
CARDIFF IS VERY PROUD OF YOU 
HARRY REDKNAPP APPEALED FOR BOTH 
SETS OF FANS TO STAY AND ENJOY THE 
CELEBRATIONS AND THE CELEBRATIONS 
AND TO BE FAIR THE CARDIFF FANS 
BY AND LARGE HAVE STUCK AROUND TO 
APPLAUD THEIR OWN TEAM AND 
PORTSMOUTH RATHER THAN LEAVING ONE 
END OF THE STADIUM EMPTY WELL DONE 
HARRY REDKNAPP LET'S HOPE THAT 
TRADITION IS MAINTAINED 
PETER ENCKELMAN THE CARDIFF CITY 
GOALKEEPER HE IS WITH JONATHAN 
PEARCE PEARCE PETER ENCKELMAN AN EARLIER ON IN 
THE GAME IT'S VERY DECISIVE WHAT 
WERE YOUR THOUGHTS AS THAT CROSS 
CAME IN FOR THAT BOWL 
IT IS A 
TOUGH ONE TO DEAL WITH THAT GOAL 
IT WAS IN THE AIR AS WELL JUST 
DROPPING DOWN L. SHOULD HAVE DONE 
BETTER BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE 
THINGS OUR DEFENCE COULD HAVE 
CLEARED IT BUT HE GOT IN FRONT OF 
ME AND TUCKED IT IN 
COULD YOU HAVE 
PUNCHED IT AWAY 
I DON'T KNOW 
MAYBE I COULD HAVE TRIED TO CATCH 
IT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I 
DIDN'T DEAL WITH IT WELL ENOUGH AND 
IT DROPPED OVER THE LINE AFTER AFTER THAT THEY DIDN'T TROUBLE YOU TOO 
MUCH 
THEY HAD A SHOT AT THE END MUCH BUT YOU CAN SEE THEY WANTED TO 
DEFEND AT ONE TO ZERO MAYBE WE COULD HAVE 
GOT THE EQUALISER AND WE HAD A 
CHANCE IN THE FIRST HALF BUT IT 
WASN'T TO BE TODAY 
HOW SPECIAL HAS 
IT BEEN THIS WHOLE STORY 
IT IS 
FANTASTIC NOT THAT THE FANS WE 
LOST THE GAME BUT THEY ARE STILL 
CHEERING US ON IT LOOKED AT IT 
HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC RUN WHAT CAN 
YOU SAY WE HAVE GOT TO BE PROUD OF 
OUR ACHIEVEMENT AS A CHAMPIONSHIP 
CLUB CHERISH THE MOMENT AND ENJOY 
IT 
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU NOW YOU IT ARE STILL ON LOAN 
MY CONTRACT IS 
UP IN THE SUMMER BUT I AM NOT GOING 
TO WORRY ABOUT TODAY UNTIL TOMORROW 
THE PORTSMOUTH CELEBRATIONS ARE 
GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER HARRY IS 
ENJOYING EVERY SECOND AND SO HE 
SHOULD SYLVAIN DISTIN AND HIS WITH 
REA STUBBS 
CONGRATULATIONS WHAT WAS IT LIKE 
GOING UP THE STEPS AND GETTING YOUR 
MEDAL 
AMAZING L. NEVER EXPECTED MEDAL THE TEAM TO PERFORM SO WELL AND GO 
THAT FAR L. AM STILL A BIT UPSET 
ABOUT FIFTH PLACE BECAUSE WE DID NOT 
PLAY WELL IN THE LAST MONTH BUT 
THAT IS AMAZING NOW WE CAN FORGET 
IT NO ONE CAN TAKE THIS AWAY FROM 
US 
GO AND CELEBRATE US WELL PLAYED ALSO TO REA STUBBS AND 
JONATHAN I HAVE NEVER HAD SO MANY 
INTERVIEWS IT IS TIME TO SOME THIS 
GAME UP THE SECOND TO THE GAME 
TO BE PLAYED AT THE REBUILT WEMBLEY 
IT IS PORTSMOUTH'S DAY HERE 
SO PORTSMOUTH HAVE WON THE F. A. CUP 
I DON'T WISH TO ALARM YOU BUT THE 
LAST TIME THAT HAPPENED WORLD WAR 
THE SECOND BROKE OUT WHATEVER HAPPENS 
PORTSMOUTH WILL BE INVADING EUROPE 
NEXT SEASON FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
THEIR HISTORY THE SUPPORTERS WILL 
STAY IN WEMBLEY FOR AS LONG AS THEY 
CAN AND SO WILL THE PLAYERS 
ENJOYING WHAT IS ALWAYS A VERY 
SPECIAL MOMENT INDEED DO YOU THINK 
THEY DESERVE IT OVERALL 
IN THE 
SECOND HALF THEY WERE TERRIFIC 
COMMISERATIONS TO CARDIFF IN TEN 
MINUTES' TIME THEIR DRESSING ROOM 
WILL BE THE LONELIEST PLACE IN THE 
WORLD BUT THEY WILL WAKE UP WITH A 
CERTAIN DEGREE OF PRIDE BECAUSE 
THEY ACQUITTED THEMSELVES SO WELL 
BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EXPERIENCE 
DISTIN AND CAMPBELL HAD A TORRID 
TIME IN THE FIRST HALF BUT WERE 
MAGNIFICENT THEY WERE THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PORTSMOUTH AND 
CARDIFF IN THE SECOND HALF IT WAS 
A GREAT SECOND HALF AND CARDIFF HAD 
THEIR MOMENTS 
CARDIFF LOST A LOT 
OF QUESTIONS OF PORTSMOUTH IN THE 
FIRST HALF L. DON'T THINK THEY ASK 
ANY IN THE SECOND HALF WHICH WAS A 
SHAME PORTSMOUTH DID WHAT THEY HAD 
TO DO THEY GOT THEIR GOAL IN THE 
FIRST HALF FROM A MISTAKE AND THEY 
SAT ON THAT DEFENDED VERY WELL 
AND WHATEVER CARDIFF CAME UP WITH 
PORTSMOUTH HAVE THE ANSWERS THEY 
DESERVE IT WENT A COMPETITION A 
TEAM THAT DREW THE COMPETITION AND 
ONLY CONCEDED ONE GOAL THEY 
DESERVE IT 
A SPECIAL MOMENT FOR 
HARRY REDKNAPP HE HAS BEEN THROUGH 
TURMOIL IN RECENT WEEKS 
OFF THE 
PITCH IT HAS NOT BEEN THE GREATEST 
TIME HE HAS GOT HIS REWARD TODAY 
HE HAS HAD AN OUTSTANDING SEASON 
AS I SAID HE HAS BROUGHT 
PORTSMOUTH BACK INTO BEING A BIG 
CLUB NOW THEY ARE IN EUROPE THEY 
CAN GO ON FROM THAT THEY HAVE A 
GREAT SET OF PLAYERS AND COACHES 
AND THEY DESERVE IT CARDIFF WILL 
WAKE UP TOMORROW DISAPPOINTED BUT 
ULTIMATELY IN A WEEK'S TIME THEY 
CAN LOOK BACK AND THEY RUN AND BE 
PROUD OF THEMSELVES 
THEY ARE GOING 
TO THEIR OWN CROWD IN THE KNOWLEDGE 
THAT THEY HAVE WON THE F. A. CUP FINAL 
IT IS ONE OF THE BEST MOMENTS THEY 
COULD HAVE IT 
A NEW LOOK AT THE 
TEAM THAT HARRY REDKNAPP BROUGHT IN 
JAMES THREE KANU THREE DISTIN 
FREED IT IS AMAZING IT IS AMAZING 
AND SOL CAMPBELL SAYS HE HAS AN ACT 
OF GETTING THE BEST OUT OF HIS 
PLAYERS BY GIVING THEM TIME OFF 
SAYING BUT THERE YOU GO YOU DO IT 
AND I WILL LOOK AFTER YOU 
THE TWO 
CENTRE BACKS WERE PART IN THE FIRST 
HALF THEY WERE GOOD IN THE SECOND 
HALF AND THAT IS WHY CARDIFF DID 
NOT GET ANY MORE CHANCES POOR 
ONE GOAL WHICH FELL 
TO KANU IT WAS 
IT WAS UNFORTUNATE FOR ANCHORMEN 
ENCKELMAN IT WAS GOOD PLAYED DOWN 
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THE BALL IN 
OLD MONEY IS VERY DIFFICULT TO 
DEFEND AGAINST GOOD PLAY 
WHETHER HE SHOULD PUNCH IT IT IS 
DIFFICULT KANU IS QUICK TO REACT 
AND IT IS IN THE BACK OF THE NECK 
AND THEN THEY ARE IN BIG TROUBLE 
WATCH THIS SPACE IN FRONT OF THE 
GOALKEEPER BEHIND THIS AND A HALF 
REALLY DIFFICULT TO DEFEND AGAINST 
YOU HAVE GOT TO GIVE SOME CREDIT TO 
KANU BECAUSE HE MISSED A SITTER 
BEFORE THAT AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
EASY FOR HIM TO HIDE BUT HE IS IN 
THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME 
AND HE HAS MADE UP FOR IT 
THAT WAS 
AFTER CARDIFF HAD 
TWO OR THREE 
GREAT CHANCES WE SAW AGAIN MAYBE 
WITH A BIT 
MORE COMPOSURE AND 
QUALITY THEY COULD HAVE BEEN IN 
FRONT 
YOU MENTIONED THAT HE MISSED FRONT AN ABSOLUTE SITTER HE MANUFACTURED 
IT FOR HIMSELF 
IT WAS A NICE BALL 
IN BUT HIS FIRST TOUCH WAS 
EXQUISITE WITH THE OUTSIDE OF THE 
BOOT HE TURNS THE DEFENDER HE 
DOES THE DIFFICULT THING BY TURNING 
AND GOING ROUND THE GOALKEEPER HE 
HAS GOT AN OPEN GOAL WATCH HIS ARM 
HE THINKS IT IS UP HE IS A CLASS 
PLAYER AT TIMES WHEN HE PICKED IT 
UP AND MAKES A BIT OF MOVEMENT AND 
GOES PAST PEOPLE HE DOES SO WITH 
CONSIDERED EASE 
AFTER A BRILLIANT 
BIT OF PLAY FROM PORTSMOUTH 
PROBABLY THE MOST OUTSTANDING 
ATTACK OF THE GAME 
THIS IS 
TERRIFIC THE WAY THEY HAVE PLAYED 
THIS IT IS IN DEFEAT DIARRA DIARRA PLAYED WELL 
WHAT A TOUCH THIS IS 
IT IS A BACK HEEL AND A HALF THEY THEY DIDN'T DO MUCH ATTACKING IN THE 
SECOND HALF BUT ON THAT OCCASION 
GREAT FOOTBALL IT IS A MISFIT I I WOULD HAVE PULLED MY HAMSTRING IF I 
TRIED TO BACK HEEL THIS THEY THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO ATTACK ON MANY 
OCCASIONS THEY HAD DONE THE HARD 
WORK IN THE FIRST HALF AND THEY 
SAID TO CARDIFF TRY TO COME AT US 
AND CARDIFF DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH 
THEY RAN OUT OF LEGS 
THE TWO AT 
CENTRE BACK TOOK A GREAT POSITIONS 
IN THE SECOND HALF AS I SAY AFTER 
COMING OFF AT HALF TIME HAVING HAD 
A REAL TORRID TIME THE TWO OF THEM 
USE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND GOT IN THE 
VITAL EXPERIENCE AND POSITION AND 
LED NEVER LEFT MUCH SPACE BEHIND 
THEY ARE ISOLATED THEMSELVES ON 
THEIR OWN BUT IN THE SECOND HALF 
THEY WERE VERY RARELY APART 
PERHAPS YOUR MATE HAD A WORD AT 
HALF TIME 
I CAN'T SAY 
CARDIFF DID HALF TIME GET THE BALL IN THE BACK OF THE NET 
ON ONE OCCASION DAVID JAMES WENT 
WALKABOUT BUT GOT AWAY WITH IT WAS 
IT HANDBALL 
WE TALK ABOUT 
ENCKELMAN MAKING A MISTAKE JAMES 
MAKES A MISTAKE IT IS A FANTASTIC 
FINISH THE REFEREE IS SPOT ON 
THERE 
IT IS HANDBALL HE PUT HIS HAND UP 
BUT WHAT A FINISH 
IT WAS HIS HAND THAT PUSHED IT UP 
GLENN LOOVENS WENT CLOSE IN THE 
SECOND HALF 
THIS WAS THE ONLY 
CHANCE IN THE SECOND HALF A GOOD 
BALL IN HE GETS AWAY FROM HERMANN 
HREIDARSSON AND GET IN THE RIGHT 
POSITION AT THE RIGHT TIME AND 
HE GETS IN THE RIGHT POSITION 
STOMACH THAT WAS A HALF CHANCE POSITION 
HE THAT WAS REALLY THE POSITION ONLY CHANCE IN THE SECOND HALF I I THINK IT FALLS TO JOHNSON HE HAS 
HAD SEVEN GOALS THIS SEASON HAVE 
AND I THINK THIS IS OUTSTANDING 
FROM JOHNSON ON JOHNSON RIGHT AT 
THE END OF THE GAME AT 
A GREAT 
CHALLENGE AT THE END OF THE MATCH 
THE GAME AT AT THE END OF THE 
GAME AND HE GETS ACROSS QUICKLY 
BECAUSE HE IS A QUICK PLAYERS WHAT WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE FOR CARDIFF NOW 
THEY COME BACK NEXT SEASON DO THEY 
BUILD ON THIS OR IS IT AN ANTI 
CLIMAX 
THEY HAVE ACQUITTED CLIMAX THEMSELVES SO WELL THIS SEASON I 
THINK THEY ARE A REALLY GOOD TEAM 
THEY PLAYED WELL TODAY IF YOU CAN 
GET A FEW PLAYERS IN YOU CAN GO 
FOR PROMOTION 
A TEN MILLION UP FOR 
RAMSEY TEN MILLION FOR RAMSEY 
PAUL PARRY WAS A THREAT IN THE 
FIRST HALF 
WHEN YOU GET CHANCES 
LIKE CARDIFF IT YOU HAVE TO TAKE 
THEM YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM CREDIT 
BECAUSE THEY DID GET IN THERE 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM HE GAVE SOL 
CAMPBELL A DIFFICULT TIME A GOOD 
SAVE BY DAVID JAMES 
AND THAT IS A 
GREAT FREE KICK 
LOOK HOW MUCH 
SPACE HE HAS GOT 
AND THIS WE HAVE 
SAID HE GETS IN A GREAT POSITION 
HE LOOKS UP AND IT IS A BIT HARSH 
WHEN HE LOOKS UP HE DOES NOT SEEM 
TO MANY OPTIONS THE ONLY OPTION IS 
TO HAVE A GO AT GOAL 
IT IS HARD TO
