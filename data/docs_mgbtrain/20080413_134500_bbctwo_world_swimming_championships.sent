AT SILLY WE TRIED TO CALL THE 
WINNERS BUT THEY COULD COME FROM 
ANYWHERE THE OTHER AMERICAN IN LANE ONE HAS 
GONE THROUGH THIS CHAP NO 
ITALIAN HAS EVER WON AN INDIVIDUAL 
GOLD CHAMPIONSHIP THIS MUST BE 
THEIR BEST CHANCE 
ABSOLUTELY NOT

HE WAS EQUAL SIXTEENTH AFTER THE HEATS 
HE HAD A SWIMMER JUST MAKE IT 
THIS THE FASTEST HUMAN BEING IT IN 
WATER DRAGANJA THE TIME WAS TWO THOUSAND EIGHTY ONE 
HE HAS TO TURN AROUND AND DO 
ANOTHER FIFTY M. HE WILL BE NEEDING 
THAT GUY IS A QUICK COMING BACK 
ANYONE COULD WIN IT 
YOU ARE RIGHT 
ABOUT THE ITALIAN IT DEPENDS HOW 
FAR HE LET DRAGANJA GET AHEAD OF 
HIM EXPECT DRAGANJA TO BE OUT QUICKLY THE FINAL OF THE MEN'S ONE HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE DRAGANJA GOT A STUNNING START HE 
IS THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER LOOK 
HOW FAR AHEAD HE IS THIS IS 
EXTRAORDINARY FIRST FIFTY M.

HE SWAM A FAST HATE IT BUT NOT THE 
GREATEST SEMI HE IS ABOUT A SECOND 
THE OUR SIDE LANES ARE GOOD THEY

THINK HE DOES NATHAN AGENT GETS 
THE GOLD NEW WORLD CHAMPION 
NATHAN ADRIAN STILL ITALY HAVE 
NOT WON A SILVER TO ITALY A 
BRONZE TO DRAGANJA DID HE PACING 
WRONG WRONG HE DID ALL HE COULD DO NATHAN 
AGEING I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE A 
THREAT A FANTASTIC HEAT THE ITALIAN A VERY DISAPPOINTED 
MAN I THINK HE WAS PLAYING WITH 
DRAGANJA HE BEAT HIM IN THE END 
ALWAYS GOES OUT SLOWLY HE FORGOT 
ABOUT LANE ONE RIGHT AT THE TOP THE EVENTUAL 
WINNER HE WAS WELL PLACED ALL THE 
WAY THROUGH I'M SURE DRAGANJA CAN 
COME BACK ON 
THE SECOND NATHAN IS STRAIGHTER ARMED HE HAD MORE OF A BENT ARM DURING THE RACE DEFINITE CHANGE HIS TECHNIQUE IN THE LAST FIVE LOOK AT THOSE SHOULDERS WELL AMAZING THE WAVES ON THE 
SPRINT EVENTS FOLLOW THE BIG GUYS 
DOWN THE POOL WE HAVE THE WORLD 
RECORD HOLDER IN THE NEXT RACE AS 
WELL WOMEN'S FIFTY M. BACKSTROKE COMING 
UP KIRSTY COVENTRY SHE IS NOT A 
GREAT SHORT SPRINTER 
COVENTRY THE FIFTY M. BACKSTROKE 
WE WERE WATCHING THAT FROM HERE 
YOU MADE A POINT ABOUT DRAGANJA IN IN THE SEMI FINAL LAST NIGHT THE LAST 
TEN M. 
HE STOPPED KICKING L. THOUGHT HE MEANT TO QUALIFY IN LANE FOUR 
BUT TONIGHT THE SAME THING HE GOES 
OUT HARD BUT DOES NOT HAVE ANY 
STEAM LEFT IN THE LEGS COMING HOME 
EVERYONE HAS THEIR LEGS DRIVING 
THE ITALIAN THE FELLOW FROM THE U. S. 
HIS LEGS ARE GONE L. L. AM SURPRISED 
HE HELD ON FOR THIRD 
KNOCKING AT 
ALL 
NO BEFORE YOU GET FOOTAGE OF ALL THE LAST TEN M. HIS LEGS ARE NOT 
MOVING IT OUT FOR US LOOK AT THE ITALIAN NEXT TO HIM 
ABSOLUTELY NO LEGS GOOD SPOT IF 
HE HAD THE LEGS HE WOULD HAVE WON 
IT WAS CLOSE 
HE NEEDS TO WORK ON THE BACK END OF 
THE LAST FIFTEEN SPECIALISED LEG WORK 
WOULD HELP WITH A FLOATING PORT 
WOULD HELP THAT IS THE WAY TO DO IT FLOATING BOARD THE WOMEN'S FIFTY M. 
BACKSTROKE FINAL COMING UP LIZZIE SIMMONDS DID WELL TO MAKE 
THE FINAL RIGHT IN THE CENTRE THE 
WORLD RECORD HOLDER CROATIAN 
KIRSTY COVENTRY LIZZIE SIMMONDS 
ONE OF THE GUTSIEST SOME AS I HAVE 
SEEN SWIMMER'S I HAVE SEEN 
SHE IS THE EUROPEAN JUNIOR CHAMPION SHE CAME OF AGE ON THE TWO HUNDRED 
THIS IS A BONUS FOR HER NOW THE 
TWO HUNDRED WAS THE BIG EVENT YOU SAW FOR 
HER TO PRACTISE THE SPRINTING 
ABSOLUTELY ANY OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE 
THIS EXPERIENCE TO RACE 
PARTICULARLY GET IN A RACE WITH 
COVENTRY AGAIN IT IS GOOD THE 
RACE SHOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE UKRAINIAN HIS SPRINTING WELL SHE 
CAME EIGHTH SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT 
BEING TIRED IF ANYONE IS TIRED IT

GOING ON 
SHE HAS EARNED SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PRIZE MONEY 
YOU GET FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR BREAKING A 
WORLD RECORD 
YOU AND I KNOW PEOPLE AT THIS LEVEL 
DO NOT DO FOR MONEY IT IS THE 
MOTIVATION TO BE A WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER NO AMOUNT OF MONEY WERE 
EXCHANGED FOR THAT 
THAT IS A TWO OR THAT SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND AS 
WELL AS THREE WORLD RECORDS AND FOR 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP TITLES IS NOT

THIS FIFTY IT IS A VERY SHORT THE 
WORLD RECORD HOLDER COMMENTARY OF

SHE HAS INVITED HANNAH MILEY TO

WORLD RECORD THE START SIMMONDS 
NEAREST US HAVE A ON A FIFTY COMETH IT IS NOT

SWIMMERS MAGNINI OF ITALY HE 
KEEPS ON GETTING BOWLES AND SILVERS 
AND BRONZES BUT THIS TIME COMING 
IT IS SILVA GOLD MEDALS 
TIME IT IS A SILVER MEDAL NO 
ITALIAN HAS EVER WON AN INDIVIDUAL 
GOLD MEDAL IN ANY EVENT WELL A 
LITTLE BIT OF A SHOCK FROM AN 
OUTSIDE LANE NATHAN ADRIAN OF THE 
U. S. A. SWAM IT TO PERFECTION A NEW 
CHAMPIONSHIP RECORD TO WIN THIS ONE HUNDRED 
METRE MEN'S FREESTYLE HE WAS 
THEREABOUTS AT FIFTY SEVENTY FIVE AND JUST 
BROUGHT IT HOME THE WINNING MARGIN 
WAS THREE ONE HUNDREDTHS OF A 
SECOND TO BE QUITE HONEST IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN THREE SECONDS HE 
HAD A GREAT RACE AND WON THE GOLD 
THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER RINGING 
OUT AROUND THE ARENA A NINTH GOLD 
MEDAL FOR THE AMERICANS THEY MOVE 
ONE AHEAD OF AUSTRALIA THE 
HIGHLIGHT OF THE WEEK SO FAR WAS 
THAT ROGAN INTERVIEW 
THE INTERVIEW WAS BIT MORE 
INTERESTING THAN THIS SEEMING 
ALMOST 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE ALMOST AUSTRIAN TEAM COACH HE WAS JUMPING 
UP AND DOWN 
HE LOVED IT 
THAT WAS 
A THREE STAR TIME FOR START MOST 
PEOPLE WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THAT 
TIME FOR A 
FREESTYLE RACE FREESTYLE TIME 
IF IT IS ALMOST 
LIKE SWIMMING IN WATER OUT THERE 
THAT IS THE THING LOT OF PEOPLE 
WANT TO SWIM IN THE OUTSIDE LANES 
YOU CAN SEE HOW WAVEY THE PULLEYS 
THERE IN THAT MEN'S ONE HUNDRED METRE 
FREESTYLE IT REALLY DOES HURT YOU 
COMING OFF THE TURNS THE 
APPALLING HIS BIRTH 
YOU CAN SEE HOW WAVEY THE POOL IS 
THERE 
DO YOU SURF ASSUME YOU DO THERE BECAUSE YOU ARE AUSTRALIAN I I ACTUALLY DO EVERY DAY THAT WAS A 
SPORT I WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED IN 
WE HAVE WORLD CHAMPION SURFER'S 
WHERE I LIVE L. THINK WE HAVE THREE 
IN THE TOP FIVE IN THE SURFING 
WORLD CHAMPION RANKINGS 
HOW MUCH 
DO YOU HAVE TO CONTROL THE OTHER 
SPORTS YOU DO ARE YOU ALLOWED TO 
PLAY OTHER SPORTS 
THESE DAYS I AM 
A BIT MORE RESTRICTED BECAUSE OF 
THE I. N. D. IS YOU CAN GET PLAYING 
OTHER SPORTS WHEN I WAS GROWING UP 
YOU WERE ENCOURAGED TO PLAY OTHER 
SPORTS BECAUSE OF THE INJURIES 
YOU CAN GET 
ONE DAY IN YOUR 
RETIREMENT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU 
WANT TO DO 
EXACTLY HURT MY 
SHOULDERS AS MUCH AS I WON ONE IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU WOULD 
THINK THEY WOULD ORGANISE SOMETHING 
WHICH DID NOT DISFAVOUR THE FASTEST 
QUALIFIER 
WE HAD A CHANCE TO CHAT QUALIFIER LAST NIGHT TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE 
FASTEST QUALIFIER COULD PICK THEIR 
OWN LANE 
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF 
THEY WALKED OUT NEXT TO THEIR 
FAVOURITE PERSON OR WHETHER THEY 
WANTED TO BE A LONG WAY AWAY FROM 
THE BEST SWIMMER 
WHICH LANE WOULD 
YOU PICK 
DEFINITELY AN OUTSIDE 
LANE ONE OR EIGHT L. WOULD LOOK AT 
WHERE I WAS GOING TO BRIEF TOO TOO MUCH INFORMATION EFIMOVA SHE WAS DISQUALIFIED IN 
THE FINAL OF THE WOMEN'S FIFTY METRE 
BREASTSTROKE FOR WOBBLING ON THE 
START SHE FINISHED SECOND 
THEREFORE GREAT BRITAIN'S KATE 
HEYWOOD WAS PROMOTED FROM EQUAL 
BRONZE TO EQUAL SILVER YOU HAVE TO 
STATE STILL AT THE START STAY 
STILL NOW COMES OUT THE FASTEST 
QUALIFIER THE RUSSIAN SWIMMER SHE 
ONLY HAS SHORT PERIOD OF TIME NOW 
TO TAKE THIS STUFF OFF THE 
TRACKSUIT SHE HAS SHORT PERIOD 
OF TIME TO GET IT ALL SORTED OUT 
IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA I LIKE IT 
IT'S MORE DRAMATIC BUT I AM NOT 
SURE IT IS FAIR ON THAT FASTEST 
QUALIFIER THE FINAL OF THE WOMEN'S 
TWO HUNDRED METRE BREASTSTROKE 
THIS IS A 
HARD ONE TO CALL IF EFIMOVA WHO I 
THINK HAS A PARTICULARLY GOOD 
STROKE SHE HAS GOT A GOOD GLIDE TAKE YOUR MARKS YULIYA EFIMOVA IT IS THE EUROPEAN 
SHORT COURSE CHAMPION SHE IS THE 
EUROPEAN CHAMPION AND RECORD HOLDER 
EIGHT LENGTHS OF BREASTSTROKE THE 
STROKE RATE AND STYLE OF THE STROKE 
CHANGES FROM THE ONE HUNDRED UP TO THIS TWO HUNDRED 
BREASTSTROKE 
ABSOLUTELY THE TWO HUNDRED BREASTSTROKE BREASTSTROKE GIVES YOU MORE OF A 
GLIDE BUT WHEN YOU SEE THAT GREAT 
MEN SWIMMING THEY ARE TURNING INTO 
MORE OF A SPRINT FOR BREASTSTROKE IS YOU NEED A LOT MORE OF A RANGE OF MOVEMENT SO 
WEARING A RESTRICTIVE ALL IN ONE 
SUIT IS NOT AZIZI YOU'LL SEE A LOT 
OF THE BREAST ROCHA'S WITH OUT THE 
ALL IN ONE SUITS ALL OF THE 
BREASTSTROKE SWIMMERS 
THE LEADER 
IS ALMOST HALF A SECOND UNDERNEATH 
WORLD RECORD PACE SHE'S WON A 
REALLY GOOD ONE HUNDRED METRES BREASTSTROKE 
IF SHE CAN KEEP THE SUB THIS COULD 
BE A REAL SHOP BECAUSE LIESEL JONES 
IS RECORD WOULD GO 
LIESEL JONES 
HAS BEEN SETTING WORLD RECORDS FOR 
YEARS BUT THE LEADING SWIMMER HAS A 
JUMP ON THE FIELD IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE IF SHE CAN HOLD 
THIS PLACE LET'S SEE HOW MUCH 
ENERGY SHE SEEMS TO HAVE THEY ARE 
CATCHING HER UP A BIT FOSTER IS 
HAVING A GOOD SWIM HERE SHE HAD A 
GREAT TRIAL FOR THE AUSTRALIAN TEAM 
EFIMOVA HAS NOT GIVEN UP HERE RIGHT AT THE TOP CAN THIS SUMMER 
WHEN IT FROM THE FRONT SHE IS 
LOOKING PRETTY GOOD STILL SALLY 
FOSTER COMING BACK IN THE CENTRE 
SHE IS GOING TO WIN THIS WHAT A 
GUTSY SWIM WHAT A GREAT WAY TO SWIM THAT 
REALLY WILL HAVE HEARD 
THAT WAS 
REALLY WELL DESERVED 
THAT REALLY 
WILL HAVE HURT IT WAS THE SECOND FASTEST TIME IN 
HISTORY ON WOMEN'S TWO HUNDRED METRE 
BREASTSTROKE 
SHE IS REALLY TIRED BREASTSTROKE BUT GUTSY REALLY GUTSY SALLY 
FOSTER THERE OF AUSTRALIA SHE IS 
HAVING A GREAT FEW MONTHS IT WILL 
BE INTERESTING TO HEAR ABOUT HER 
HISTORY BECAUSE SHE'S TWENTY THREE YEARS OF 
AGE AND COMING THROUGH SHE WILL BE 
REALLY HAPPY WITH THAT SHE REALLY WENT FOR IT FROM THE 
START NOT QUITE AS HIGH AS MANY OF 
THE SUMMER'S COME UP ON HER 
BREASTSTROKE 
ON A TWO HUNDRED METRES YOU BREASTSTROKE DON'T WANT TO BE TO HER TO JERKY SOME WEEKS YOU CAN GO INTO 
TRAINING AND IT IS OUT OF SYNC AND 
YOU FEEL AWFUL FOR A WHOLE WEEKEND 
THEN SUDDENLY IT CLICKED BACK IN A 
LOT OF THE GREAT TWO HUNDRED BREASTSTROKE 
SWIMMERS SWIM ARE LOWER 
THAT WAS 
THE FINAL WALL AND GOODNESS ME SHE 
LOOKED TIRED HARDLY ANY CAKE THERE 
TOUCHING THE WALL SHE IS NOT 
PUNCHING THE AIR IS SHE A NEW CHAMPIONSHIP RECORD THE 
SECOND FASTEST TIME IN HISTORY FOR 
THE SOUTH AFRICAN SWIMMER SHE IS 
THE SECOND SWIMMER TONIGHT TO WIN 
FROM LANE ONE SALLY FOSTER GET THE 
SILVER YULIYA EFIMOVA GETS THE 
BRONZE 
WE ARE GOING TO GET THE WINNER UP 
FOR AN INTERVIEW I'M NOT SURE SHE 
KNEW SHE HAD WON 
NO BEING OUT IN 
LANE EIGHT IT WAS A REALLY GET SEE 
A WINNER SHE WAS UNDER WORLD 
RECORD SPEED WITH FIFTY METRES TO GO 
IT WAS A GREAT SOUL 
LET'S FIND OUT 
WHETHER SHE WON OR NOT 
CONGRATULATIONS A THREE SECOND 
PERSONAL BEST GREAT TO BE AROUND 
THE OUTSIDE BECAUSE YOU CAN DO YOUR 
OWN THING 
DEFINITELY THERE WAS NO 
PRESSURE AND I COULD DO WHAT I 
WANTED FOCUS ON MY OWN SOUL EVERY 
TIME I TURNED I CLOSED MY EYES TO 
DO MY OWN THING 
A LITTLE BIT LESS 
CHOPPY BECAUSE SOME OF THE SWIMMERS 
ARE SAYING IT IS A WAY PEOPLE I I DON'T NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BUT I 
WAS TOLD THIS MORNING THAT OUTSIDE 
LANES ARE GOOD 
A SPECIAL MESSAGE 
FROM YOUR BOYFRIEND BEFORE AND I I LOVE HIM TO BITS ANGEL THANK YOU 
SO MUCH 
WELL DONE 
THANK YOU L. I WONDER WHAT THE MESSAGE WAS IT IT MUST HAVE BEEN GOOD EXACTLY EXACTLY UNBELIEVABLE SWIM TO DO IT FOR 
LANE AID GUTSY EFFORT WHAT WHAT ABOUT SALLY FOSTER 
SALLY I THINK 
SHE HAS BEEN OVERSHADOWED HAVING 
LIESEL JONES WE HAD ANOTHER 
SWIMMER SWIMMING FAST IN THIS EVENT 
AS WELL IT IS GREAT TO SEE HER IN 
THE OLYMPIC TEAM SHE COULD DO 
SOMETHING AT THIS OLYMPICS SHE HAS 
BEEN IN THE SHADOW OF LIESEL JONES 
IN SEVERAL EVENTS NOW IT WILL 
HOPEFULLY BE HER TURN TO WIN 
IT IS 
AMAZING HOW COMPETITIVE SWIMMING IS 
IN AUSTRALIA IF YOU ASK SOMEBODY 
IN AUSTRALIA DO THIS WELL AND THEY 
SAY NO IT'S JUST BE AS THEY HAVE 
NOT REPRESENTED AUSTRALIA 
EVERYBODY SOAMES 
FOR ONE THING 
THAT HAS KEPT IT GOING IS THE FACT 
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS WE'VE 
HAD WORLD CHAMPIONS AND RECORD 
HOLDERS WE HAD A GREAT 
COMMONWEALTH GAMES AND THAT KEPT 
PEOPLE INTERESTED THAT IS THE 
REASON THAT DOMESTICALLY WE'VE HAD 
SUCH STRONG COMPETITION WHEN WHEN KIEREN PERKINS WAS WORKING HIS 
MEDALS DID YOU SAY I WANT TO BE 
THE NEXT YEAR GURKHAS ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY WHEN I WAS WATCHING HIM AT FIRST 
HIS WIN HIS FIRST OLYMPIC RECORD 
I SAID I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT AS 
A FIFTEEN HUNDRED METRES WERE MAN AND LOOKED 
UP TO HIM IN SYDNEY HAD HAD THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE MY HERO AND 
BEAT HIM IT WAS A DREAM SCENARIO 
THAT CAME TRUE 
I'M SURE IT WAS NOT 
HIS TRUE LET'S FIND OUT ABOUT THE 
MEDAL CEREMONY GOING ON BEHIND US 
CHINA HAVE SENT A VERY SMALL TEAM 
HERE BUT THIS SWIMMER GOT A BRONZE 
MEDAL TWO YEARS AGO AND A SILVER 
MEDAL FOUR YEARS AGO ANOTHER 
SILVER HERE L. WONDER IF WE WILL 
SEE HER IN BEIJING INFORMANTS TIME 
IN FOUR MONTHS' TIME 
IN THE END FOR ME A SURPRISINGLY 
COMFORTABLE VICTORY A NEW WORLD 
RECORD 
SHE REALLY IS A FIFTY SPECIALIST JUST 
A BRONZE ON THE ONE HUNDRED SHE DOESN'T DO 
THE TWO HUNDRED WORLD CHAMPION WORLD 
RECORD HOLDER SHE BEAT THE WORLD 
RECORD BY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE HUNDREDTHS OF A 
SECOND WHICH IS TOURING IS A LONG 
WAY 
SHE IS THE FIFTH CROATIAN TO WIN A 
GOLD MEDAL IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
SHORT COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS SHE IS 
THE FIRST WOMAN AND SHE DID IN 
STYLE 
GOING BACK TO WHEN WE WERE TALKING 
ABOUT GETTING INSPIRATION FROM 
KIEREN PERKINS ARE THERE OTHER 
SPORTS STARS THAT YOU LOOK AT AND 
THINK I WOULD LIKE TO TRADE TIPS 
WITH THEM 
CERTAINLY I THINK 
PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL JORDAN ROGER 
FEDERER TIGER WOODS THE GOOD 
THEM UNDER PRESSURE SITUATIONS 
LOOK AT THEM UNDER PRESSURE 
SITUATIONS WHEN THEY COME THROUGH 
THEY CONSISTENTLY PERFORM HE WANT 
THE BEST TRAITS OF ALL OF THEM AND 
SEE HOW THEY DO IT HOW WOULD LIKE 
TO TALK TO EACH OF THEM AND SEE HOW 
THEY TAKE 
HE CANNOT DO THAT AT 
ALL WHEN WOULD YOU GATHER WITH 
THEM 
YOU GET OPPORTUNITIES TO COME THEM ACROSS THESE GUYS L. DO WITH THE 
AUSTRALIAN ATHLETES I GET 
OPPORTUNITIES TO SIT DOWN STEVE 
WAUGH IS MENTORING OUR TEAM AT THIS 
OLYMPICS WE DO GET TO INTERACT 
WITH SOME OF THE SPORTS PEOPLE AND 
IT IS GREATER TO SIT DOWN AND TALK 
TO THEM L. HAVE NOT HAD THE 
OPPORTUNITY LLEYTON HEWITT MARK 
PHILIPPOUSSIS AND ROGER FEDERER I 
WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO THEM SHANE SHANE WARNE WOULD BE A GOOD GUIDE TO GO 
AND HAVE A BEER WITH WE ARE GOING 
TO FIND OUT WHETHER LIAM TANCOCK 
CAN PERFORM UNDER IMMENSE PRESSURE 
BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY HIGH QUALITY 
ONE HUNDRED METRES INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY FINAL 
COMING UP HE IS GOING TO BE TAKING 
ON THE RYAN LOCHTE IT IS 
GOING TO BE INTERESTING THERE ARE A FEW OTHER GUYS WHO ARE GOING TO BE THERE AND RYAN LOCHTE

HOW MUCH HE HAS LEFT IN HIS TANK 
HE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE 
BACKSTROKE HE IS A REAL COMPETITOR 
I ASKED ABOUT THE TACTICS AND HE 
SAID THERE ARE NONE YOU JUST GO 
FOR IT 
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE TANCOCK 
HAVE A GO AHEAD FANTASTIC IF HE 
COULD GET IT TANCOCK WILL BE IN FIVE RYAN 
LOCHTE IS THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER 
HE WAS NOT LONG AGO IT MUST HAVE 
TAKEN A HUGE AMOUNT OUT OF RYAN 
LOCHTE LOCHTE HE HAS HAD TO REGROUP THE

TECHNICALLY DIFFICULT YOU HAVE 
DIFFERENT TURNS IT IS NOT LIKE

INTERVIEWS WATCHING HIM SWIM

AM NOT SURE ABOUT UNDOING EACH 
OTHER'S ZIPS IT IS A BIT STRANGE HE IS WASTED THE GUTS OF THAT HE 
LOST HIS WORLD RECORD BUT SWUNG 
FASTER THAN HIS OLD WORLD RECORD IT IS AWE INSPIRING FOR SOMEBODY 
TO HAVE THE GUTS MENTAL ABILITY TO 
RESET THEMSELVES THE ENERGY AND 
STAMINA THE STRENGTH FANTASTIC 
WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM HE IS SO 
LAID BACK YOU QUESTION WHETHER ALL 
THE LIGHTS ARE ON THIS GUY IS FANTASTIC

I WILL LET YOU GO 
THANK YOU 
HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE EXHAUSTED 
HE LOOKED EXHAUSTED BEFORE HE WENT 
OUT SO LANGUID L. THOUGHT THE MAN 
IS HALF DEAD 
IT PROBABLY FELL UP 
HE IS A TRUE CHAMPION THE FUNNIEST 
THING IS HE LOOKED SLOW GOT ON THE 
BLOCK AND HE HAD THE FASTEST 
REACTION TIME HE WAS FASTER THAN 
ANYONE IN THE FIELD HE WANTED IT 
REPAIRED TO COME OUT HERE HE 
THE CREAM ROSE TO THE TOP QUICKLY 
IT WAS BETWEEN THE THREE OF THEM 
AMAZINGLY LOOKER LEADERS LIKE TIGER 
WOODS AND FEDERER SOME OF THEM 
COME OUT AND THEY ARE AGGRESSIVE 
LIKE NADAL AND SOME ARE LANGUID 
LIKE RYAN LOCHTE 
YOU SEE THE 
PERSONALITY SHINES THROUGH WHAT AN 
INTERVIEW OR THE LEAD AT THE RACE 
THE WAY THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES 
OFTEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RELAXED 
AND DRIFT UMPIRE ARE THE ONES WHO 
CAN HANDLE BIG EVENTS AND 
PROGRAMMES THEY DO NOT LET THE 
HEIGHT WASTE ENERGY 
CAN HE GIVE 
PHELPS PROBLEMS 
NO DOUBT L. THINK 
HE CAN DO IT IN THEIR TWO HUNDRED TO 
MICHAEL PHELPS HE IS UP THERE 
WATCHING THIS AND HE WILL BE DOING 
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE 
SCARE 
WHEN YOU ARE AT THE TOP OF SCARE YOUR GAME AND THERE FOR A LONG TIME 
AS YOU HAVE DO YOU LOOK AROUND AND 
THINK WHO OTHER CHALLENGES OR ARE 
YOU TRYING TO IMPROVE YOURSELF AND 
RACE AGAINST THE SELF 
THE FOCUS 
HAS TO BE ON YOURSELF YOU CANNOT 
CONTROL SEMINARS YOU CAN DO YOUR 
BEST BUT IF SOMEONE BEATS THE A. N. N. 
WILDE RECORD THEY DO THEY DO AT 
THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE TO BE 
EDUCATED ON WHAT THE COMPETITION IS 
DOING AND WHO IS GOING TO BE THE 
MAIN COMPETITION L. WOULD USE THAT 
FOR MOTIVATION SEE A SWIM AND SAY 
I HAVE TO GO BACK TOMORROW AND GET 
THE EXTRA ONE PER CENT OUT OF MYSELF AND BE 
BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO THEY STAYED 
FOCUS ON YOURSELF AND YOUR GRACE 
AND DINNER WORRY ABOUT ANYONE ELSE 
THE WORK AND PREP IS DONE FOCUS ON 
YOURSELF AND A OR GET YOUR BEST 
RESULT 
WE TALK ABOUT TRAINING AND RESULT HOW MUCH WORK YOU PUT IN WHEN YOU 
ARE AS GOOD AS YOU ARE THERE ARE 
TINY THINGS YOU ARE WORKING ON WITH 
DIFFERENT STROKES 
THERE IS ALWAYS 
SOMETHING TO IMPROVE ON 
COMPLACENCY IS THE WORST THING IF 
YOU GET COMPLACENT YOU ARE DOING 
EVERYTHING RIGHT AND GOT IT COVERED 
YOU DO NOT THERE IS ALWAYS 
SOMETHING EXTRA TO DO THERE IS 
ALWAYS SOMETHING TO IMPROVE IF YOU 
DO NOT DO THAT YOU CAN KISS NOT 
ONLY GOAL GO BY BUT ANY MEDAL WE WE HAVE ANOTHER MEDALS CEREMONY NOW 
THE OTHER THING TO TAKE ON BOARD 
WITH THE BIG MEETS HIS PRESS 
DOPING AND MEDALS CEREMONIES 
EXACTLY THE T. V. ANY SHOWS TEN PER CENT OF 
WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU HAVE TO GO 
TO WARM UP DRUG TESTING MEDAL 
PRESENTATION SO MANY BITS AND 
PIECES MASSAGE SWIM DOWN I 
REMEMBER THE COMMONWEALTH GAMES IN 
MANCHESTER AND I DIDN'T FINISH 
DRUG TESTING UNTIL THERE 
ARE A LOT BY GOES ON BEHIND THE 
SCENES IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT RACING 
IT IS ABOUT THE OTHER THINGS YOU 
HAVE TO DO AS WELL 
THAT IS WHY IT 
HELPS IF YOU ARE A LANGUID LAID 
BACK CHARACTER LIKE RYAN LOCHTE 
LET'S WHO WILL BE STEPPING UP TO 
RECEIVE THE MEDALS 
THE WINNER OF 
THE BRONZE MEDAL FROM RUSSIA 
HE GOT A SILVER IN THE TWO HUNDRED TO 
MARCUS BROGAN THERE WAS A COUPLE 
OF WEEKS AGO 
GOOD ONSHORE COURSE NOT SO GOOD ON 
LONG COURSE LONG COURSE IS ALL 
IMPORTANT 
I DIDN'T EXPECT THE TIME TO BE 
ANYWHERE NEAR AS QUICK L. L. EXPECTED 
RYAN LOCHTE TO GO FAST AND TO WIN 
THE GOLD IT IS A SILVER MEDAL THE 
TIME IS STUNNING 
IT WAS ONLY GOOD ENOUGH FOR SO WELL 
WHAT A BUSY PROGRAMME HE HAS HAD 
ANY PROGRAMME AFTER THIS WILL SEEM 
EASY MENTALLY L. AM SURE THAT IS 
WHAT HE IS DOING HE WILL GO TO THE 
AMERICAN TRIALS AND THE OLYMPICS 
WITH FEWER RACES LESS BUSY AND HE 
KNOWS HE CAN COME UP WITH THE GOODS 
THIS IS THE SWIM OF THAT NEED 
AUSTRIA UNTIL THIS RACE HAD NEVER 
WON A GOLD MEDAL HE HAD WON THREE 
SILVERS FINALLY HE HAS DONE IT 
AND WHAT A WAY TO DO IT WORLD 
RECORD 
WORLD CHAMPION MEN'S TWO HUNDRED M. 
BACKSTROKE MARCUS FROM AUSTRIA PLEASE STAND FOR THE NATIONAL 
ANTHEM OF AUSTRIA 
A GIN AND ANDY TANNER ASKED YOU A 
POTENTIALLY STUPID QUESTION 
ADRIAN THREE STAR IS YOUR CHOICE 
OF STROKE CAN I ASK YOU A IF ROGAN DECIDED TO SWIM BACKSTROKE 
IN A THREE STAR RACE COULD HE YES YES HE COULD START ON THE BLOCK GET A 
DIVE AND THEN QUALIFY FOR THE 
BRITISH RELAY 
THAT WOULD BE REALLY 
EXCITING HE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO 
IT 
IT WOULD BE A VERY STRANGE IT THING I MEAN REALLY THAT TIME IS 
JUST UNBELIEVABLE THE FACT THAT 
TWO MEN DID IT IT IS STUNNING IT 
WILL BE INTERESTING AT THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES IT IS NOT NECESSARILY TRUE 
THAT RYAN LOCHTE IS GOING TO MAKE 
THE OLYMPIC TEAM YET THEY HAVE NOT 
HAD THE TRIALS THE AMERICAN 
STRENGTH AND DEPTH IS EXTRAORDINARY 
ADRIAN A THING MIGHT NOT EVEN MAKE 
THEIR REINA FANTASTIC STRENGTH AND 
DEPTH 
THERE IS A DANGER THAT RINA DEPTH LOCHTE MIGHT TAKE TOO LONG TO 
RECOVER FROM THIS THIS MIGHT TAKE 
A LOT OUT OF HIM BRIAN LOCHTE 
DOING THAT MANY RACES IT WILL TAKE 
HIM A FEW WEEKS TO RECOVER BRIAN 
LOCHTE LIKE THE BOYS WERE SAYING 
THERE IS SO MUCH DEBT IN THE 
OLYMPIC TEAM IF YOU ARE NOT FIRST 
OR SECOND YOU ARE THIRD PHELPS 
WENT WITH HIM OH THREE OF SECOND YOU 
HAVE LARGE TEA AND THEN YOU HAVE 
OTHER SWIMMERS WHO ARE JUST WITHIN 
THAT LOCHTE 
WE TALK ABOUT 
GETTING USED TO ALL THE 
DISTRACTIONS THAT GO WITH A MAJOR 
EVENTS WHAT ABOUT THAT TIME 
DIFFERENCE IN BEIJING YOU MAY WELL 
SWIM HEATS AT NIGHT AND BE DOING 
DRUG TESTING AND THEN HAVE TO GET 
UP EARLY FOR A FINAL 
I HAVE HAD A 
LOT OF TESTING IT CAN BE 
DISTRESSED DISTRACTING IT'S A 
GOOD THING I CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM 
WHENEVER I WANT TO IF YOU ARE A 
MICHAEL PHELPS ON LOCHTE YOU HAVE 
SO MANY EVENTS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE 
TO DO EVERYTHING VERY RELAXED AND 
VERY EFFICIENTLY IT IS DIFFICULT 
YOU ONLY WANT TO DO THESE SORT OF 
COMPETITIONS EVERY NOW AND THEN TO 
PREPARE FOR AN OLYMPIC BECAUSE IT TAKES 
A LONG 
TIME TO 
RECOVER FROM IT 
THE BIG CHALLENGE FOR GEMMELL LOW 
AND ELLEN GANDY THEY ARE IN THE 
WOMEN'S FINAL OF THE ONE HUNDRED METRE 
BUTTERFLY GEMMA LOWE BRITAIN 
HAVE NEVER WON A MEDAL IN THIS 
EVENT THE ONE HUNDRED METRE BUTTERFLY 
HERE LEADING THEM OUT SIXTEEN YEAR OLD 
ELLEN GANDY BRITISH WOMEN'S 
SWIMMING AT THE MOMENT IS BEING LED 
BY A BIG PATCH OF YOUNG GUNS 
HALSALL IS EIGHTEEN AND ELLEN GANDY IS 
SIXTEEN 
ABSOLUTELY FORGET BEIJING I SIXTEEN THINK LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WILL BE GREAT FOR 
THE SWIMMERS 
FORGET BEIJING L. I THINK THERE WILL PEAK IN 
LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
WELL IT IS GOOD NEWS 
BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME GOOD 
COMPETITORS GOING IN AS WELL 
THE BRITISH TEAM CONSISTENTLY HERE 
HAS RAISED REALLY WELL WE ARE 
SEEING GROOT OF HOLLAND LOOTS OF 
SOUTH AFRICA HE IS THE SECOND

OVATION FOR HER SHE SWAM A REALLY 
BRILLIANT FLY THAT WAS GOOD 
EXPENSE THE TWO HUNDRED M. BUTTERFLY YOU YOU ARE RIGHT ANDY THAT WAS A GOOD 
EXPERIENCE SHE HAS GOT OVER THAT 
HURDLE IF YOU LIKE OF 
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU CANNOT LET 
IT GET TOO FAR OVER YOU L. WAS 
PLEASED THE WAY THAT SHE BOUNCED 
BACK FROM THAT WALKING OUT INTO A 
CROWD OF NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE IT IS 
QUITE INTENSE YOU DON'T OFTEN DO 
THAT AS A BRITISH SWIMMER THERE THERE SHE IS SHE SET THE BRITISH RECORD 
A CRACKING SWIM IN FOUR GALVEZ OF AUSTRALIA SHE 
SET A NEW OLYMPIC WORLD RECORD ON 
THE FLY SHE IS IN GREAT SPRINT 
FORM SHE IS IN FANTASTIC DISTANCE 
FORM THIS COULD BE THE PERFECT 
RACE FOR HER 
YOU ARE RIGHT L. THINK SHE WILL BE HARD TO BEAT KOMISARZ IS STRONG GALVEZ IS PROBABLY THE FAVOURITE THE WOMEN'S ONE HUNDRED METRE BUTTERFLY 
FINAL RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM THERE IS 
ELEANOR GANDY OF GREAT BRITAIN SIXTEEN 
YEAR OLD BLOKE MACRO IN FIVE 
LOWE IN FIVE KOMISARZ IN LANE 
THREE GOING OUT THE FASTEST 
SHE IS 
HAVING A GOOD FIRST TWENTY FIVE GALVEZ IS 
TURNING IT ON NOW L. DON'T THINK 
SHE IS GOING FLAT OUT SHE HAD A 
GREAT WORLD RECORD BUT SHE WILL 
NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE THAT DUJE 
DRAGANJA MADE ON THE ONE HUNDRED FREESTYLE 
SHE HAS SOMETHING LEFT IN THE TANK 
LOWE HAVING REALLY GOOD SWIM HERE 
THIS IS SUPER SWIM FROM GALVEZ 
SHE LOOKS REALLY COMFORTABLE SHE 
DID NOT QUITE SPOT THAT VERY 
POWERFUL UNDERWATER GALVEZ IS 
LOOKING GREAT UNDERWATER SHE DID 
NOT QUITE SPOT THAT TURN UNDER THE 
WORLD RECORD PACE AT THE MOMENT 
FIFTY FIVE POINT EIGHT NINE IT IS A WORLD RECORD A 
STUNNING SWIM A WORLD RECORD FOR 
HER ON THE FIFTY AND NOW A WORLD 
RECORD ON THE ONE HUNDRED SHE GOT A SILVER 
IN THE TWO HUNDRED SHE IS IN THE 
FORM OF 
HER LIFE CAN SHE WIN BEIJING AS

THAT WAS SHE PROBABLY WATCHED 
THAT DUJE DRAGANJA MAKING A 
MISTAKE ANOTHER BRITISH RECORD FOR 
HER ANOTHER BRITISH MEDAL FOR THE 
TEAM NO A CRACKING TIME AGAIN 
I HAVE GOT TO SAY ELLEN GANDY SHE 
WAS IN EIGHT POSITION BUT SHE WAS 
EIGHT IN A LIFETIME BEST THE 
STANDARD OF WORLD SWIMMING IS JUST 
DROPPING AND DROPPING GALVEZ A 
NEW WORLD RECORD KOMISARZ SECOND 
JUST OUTSIDE THE OLD WORLD RECORD 
AND LOWE GETTING ANOTHER MEDAL FOR 
GREAT BRITAIN 
SO A VERY WELL 
PACED RACE FOR ME L. THINK GALVEZ 
PERFECT PERFECT FOR HER TINY 
PERFECT FOR HER SPRINTING DID NOT 
OVER COMMIT ALMOST IT UP ON THE 
FIRST LENT AS A FEW SPRINTERS HAVE 
DONE ON THE ONE HUNDRED OR MESS IT UP 
YOU HAVE A FEW MEDALS NOW AS PART 
OF A RELAY BUT THAT ONE IS 
PROBABLY YOUR FAVOUR YES YES DEFINITELY I REALLY WANTED TO GO 
FOR THAT BECAUSE I MESSED UP THE 
TWO HUNDRED I COULD HEAR THE ENERGY FROM 
THE CROWD I 
COULD HEAR 
THEM WHEN I 
WAS SWIMMING IT WAS AMAZING YOU YOU KEPT YOUR PACING AND CONTROL 
DEFINITELY I 
WAS VERY EXCITED L. WAS GETTING READY TO GO FOR IT AND 
I SAID BACK OFF BACK OF SAVE IT 
FOR THE END 
I SAW YOU MAKE A 
LITTLE SMILE AS YOU CAME OUT AND 
THE CROWD WENT 
CRAZY ARE 
YOU ABLE 
TO FEED OFF THEIR ENERGY 
DEFINITELY YOU GET TINGLE INSIDE 
IT FEELS SO GOOD L. LOVE IT MANY MANY CONGRATULATIONS IT IS YOUR FIRST 
MAJOR FINAL OF THIS STANDARD A 
PERSONAL BEST YOU CANNOT ASK ANY 
MORE

PERFECT DISTANCE FOR FELICITY 
GALVEZ GOAL TO AUSTRALIA SILVER 
FOR AMERICA AND LOWE GET THE BRONZE 
OUR STRENGTH AND DEBT IS QUITE GOOD 
IN GREAT BRITAIN BUT SUCH IS THE 
STRENGTH AND DEPTH IN AUSTRALIA 
GALVEZ WILL GO TO THE OLYMPICS BUT 
NOT IN THAT EVENT 
SHE WAS BEHIND 
SOME OF HER TEAM MATES THE 
PREVIOUS WORLD RECORD HOLDER 
INCLUDED A LOT OF DEBT IN 
AUSTRALIA IN THE BUTTERFLY EVENTS

SPECIALIST A LOT OF DEPTH YOU 
HAVE GOT THEIR FLY RECORD THE ONE HUNDRED

HER SHE'S STILL GOT UNDER IT SHE JUST DOES IT HERE LOOK AT THIS

THOUGH THAT LUCK OR IS IT THOUGH JUDGMENT WHETHER YOU GET IT RIGHT 
IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH YOU 
KNOW WHERE YOU HAVE TO COME UP AND 
YOU KNOW APPROXIMATELY WHERE YOU 
ARE GOING TO 
BE PLACED 
WHEN YOU 
ON THE WALL 
BUT SOMETIMES 
IT 
BE A LITTLE BIT OUT OF 
WHACK YOUR 
ARMS STOP LIKE THIS ON THE WALL IT 
IS GETTING THAT TIMING PERFECT AND 
GETTING THE RACE EXACTLY RIGHT 
LIKE MARK FOSTER SAYS HE DOES FIVE 
KICKS UNDER THE WATER TURNS ROUND 
AND HEADS 
BACK AND 
DOES THE 
THING YOU HAVE 
TO KNOW 
PRECISELY 
WHAT YOU ARE DOING 
HOW MUCH 
INTEREST WILL THERE BE IN AUSTRALIA 
WILL THERE BE IN AUSTRALIA IS 
ANYBODY TAKING LIVE COMMENTARY OF 
THIS EVENT EVERYONE IS A SLEET I I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WILL BE TAKING 
LIVE COVERAGE OF THIS BUT EVERYONE 
WILL BE INTERESTED EVERYONE IS 
ASLEEP 
I AM SURE THEY WILL BE 
REVERBERATIONS OUT TO SOUTH AFRICA 
THEY WON GOLD IN THE WOMEN'S TWO HUNDRED 
METRE BREASTSTROKE 
WELL ANOTHER MEDAL CEREMONY AND 
ANOTHER SOUTH AFRICAN EFIMOVA GET 
THE BRONZE SHE SWAM A BRILLIANT 
RACE ALL ON HER OWN VAN BILJON OF 
SOUTH AFRICA A BRONZE ON THE ONE HUNDRED 
METRE BREASTSTROKE AND THIS TIME 
GOLD FOR THE TWO HUNDRED M. A NEW RECORD IT 
WAS THE WAY SHE DID IT FROM THE 
FRONT SHE REALLY WENT FOR IT IT 
WAS A BIT OF A CROWD PLEASER SHE 
WAS WAY OUT THE ONLY WAY SHE COULD 
HAVE DONE 
IT FROM 
THE OUTSIDE 
LANE 
AND IT WORKED SO WELL SHE IS THE 
NEW WORLD CHAMPION SHE WINS THE 
TWO HUNDRED METRE BREASTSTROKE 
LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN THE NATIONAL ANTHEM OF 
THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA 
THE SOUTH AFRICAN HAVE THEM 
ANTHEM THAT GIVES THEM THEIR FIRST 
GOOD LOOK AT LOTS OF THESE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS THEY ARE IN EIGHTH 
PLACE ON THE TABLE 
THAT IS THE MOST MEDALS BRITAIN 
HAVE EVERYONE AT A SWIMMING 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND IF THEY WERE TO 
GET ONE MORE GOLD MEDAL IT WOULD 
EQUAL THE TALLY OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND 
AND NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND GRANT VARIOUS 
OTHER QUESTIONS THAT I AM BEGINNING 
TO ASK YOU ONE OF THEM IS AGAIN 
ABOUT TRAINING I'M OBSESSED ABOUT 
TRAINING BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME DO 
SO MUCH OF IT ARE YOU COUNTING 
STROKES WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT WE WE DO A LOT OF THAT SORT OF STUFF WE 
COUNT STROKES TO SEE EFFICIENCY AND 
WE ALSO DO BAIDOA MECHANICS 
BIOMECHANICS IN LEISURE A STRAIGHT 
DISTANCE AND YOU COUNT YOUR STROKES 
AND A STROKE FOR LOSS OF TWO WE 
BRING A LOT OF MEASUREMENTS INTO IT 
TO SEE WHAT IS BEST L. ACTUALLY 
HAVE TO CHANGE MAESTRO CRAIG FOR 
EACH EVENT LEG CONTRIBUTION AND 
OTHER THINGS WHICH COME INTO 
TRAINING WE ARE NOT MADE TO GO ON 
WATER WE ARE NOT HYDRO DYNAMIC AND 
THAT IS THE SAY THE GREAT THING 
ABOUT THESE SUITS THEY MAKE A 
SMALL HYDRO DYNAMIC BUT MAKING 
SURE YOU DO IT AS EASILY AS 
POSSIBLE AND HITTING THE TECHNICAL 
ASPECT RIGHT IS IMPORTANT 
WHAT IS 
YOUR MEASUREMENT 
IT DEPENDS AND 
IN THE FINAL I GO TO TWENTY FIVE METRES 
BREASTSTROKE 
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BREASTSTROKE LONG AND LANGUID AS IT WERE THESE 
GUYS ARE LOOKING AT A LOT OF 
SPLASH THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT 
SO FLASH AND DASH 
THESE ARE THE 
BIG GUYS THE MEN'S FIFTY METRES 
BREASTSTROKE FINAL THEY ARE MASSIVE THEY COULD PICK 
UP THE BODIES THEY'VE GOT 
MASSIVE UPPER BODIES 
YOU HAVE TO 
BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER EGG THIS 
RACE SOMETIMES YOU SEE SOME OF 
THESE BIG GUYS RUSH THE FIRST TWO 
OR THREE STROKES YOU HAVE TO SET 
INTO A RHYTHM AND IF YOU GET THAT A 
LITTLE BIT TOO QUICKLY YOU RUIN 
THE WHOLE RACE L. THINK THE FIRST 
STROKE OR TWO YOU HAVE TO SET IT 
RIGHT 
GERHARD ZANDBERG WAS LAST IN RIGHT A PICTURE IN YOUR PICTURE HE 
GOT A BRONZE MEDAL ON THE FIFTY 
FREESTYLE AND HERE HE IS IN THE 
FIFTY BREASTSTROKE FINAL VERY UNUSUAL 
THIS GUY IS VERY UNPREDICTABLE FOR 
ME HERE IS YOUR MAN HE IS THE GUY TO 
BEAT HE HAS BEEN CHAMPION OVER THE 
EUROPEAN SHORT COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
OVER SEVERAL YEARS THIS IS THE 
FASTEST QUALIFIER 
ADRIAN WE HAVE 
JUST SEEN AND HEARD SOUTH AFRICA OR 
AT THE TOP OF THE MEDAL PODIUM 
THERE ARE TWO BIG SOUTH AFRICA AS 
OTHERS 
I STILL PUT MY MONEY ON OTHERS OLEG 
OLEG IS A VERY BIG CHAP IN OLEG LANE FIVE HE IS THE WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER LOOK AT HIS UPPER BODY 
STRENGTH THEY ARE NOT NECESSARY 
THE TALLEST GUYS BUT THE UPPER BODY 
STRENGTH IS MASSIVE YOU ARE RIGHT TAKE YOUR MARKS FIFTY METRES BREASTSTROKE NOTHING TO 
CHOOSE ON START THE SOUTH 
AFRICAN IT GOING WELL IN THE SILVER 
CUP IN THE CENTRE NOTHING TO 
CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM WHO IS GOING TO GET THAT OUT THAT 
WAS A STUNNING SECOND THE TWENTY FIVE A A ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY THE 
AMERICAN WAS IN THE LEAD AND 
BLURRED ON THE FINISH BLEW IT ON 
THE FINISH THE UPPER BODY STRENGTH OF THESE 
SPRINT BREASTSTROKE SWIMMERS IS 
INCREDIBLE 
ABSOLUTELY IF ANYBODY INCREDIBLE GOES TO THE GYM AND WORKS ON THE 
PECTORALS IT IS ALL ABOUT THAT 
BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO SQUEEZE 
THE WATER YOU BEND YOUR ELBOWS AND 
SQUEEZE THE WATER BACKWARDS THERE 
IS A LOT OF BICEP AND PECTORAL 
MUSCLES BEING USED IT IS VERY HARD 
TO DO THERE IS A RIGIDITY TO IT AS 
WELL HERE COMES THE TURNER NO ONE HE IS THE WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER AND THE WORLD SHORT COURSE 
CHAMPION ON THE BREASTSTROKE BUT 
AT THE FINISH AT THE TOP ABSOLUTE 
STINKER IT WAS ON SHORT COURSE 
SWIMMING IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS 
STARTS TURNS AND FINISHES 
HE POINTED OUT THAT AT THE FINISH 
HE WAS UNLUCKY 
WHERE TO COMES TO 
BUTTERFLY THE TIMING IS CRITICAL 
BECAUSE THEY ARE UNIQUE STROKES 
WHEN IT COMES TO BREASTSTROKE OR 
BUTTERFLY YOU HAVE A LOT OF GLYDE 
AND MOVEMENT IN EACH STROKE THERE 
IS A LOT OF STROKE DISTANCE IF YOU 
SCRATCH OUT YOU DON'T GET ON THE 
WALL AND TAKE AN EXTRA STROKE YOU 
DON'T GET THE FIRST PLACE NOBODY NOBODY HAD SIT WITH THEIR HEAD DO THEY 
HE WOULD PROBABLY LIKE TO 
THE VERY 
DIFFERENT SHAPE WE TALKED ABOUT 
THE PECTORAL MUSCLES THEY DO A LOT 
OF WEIGHT 
THESE GUYS SPEND A LOT 
OF TIME AT THE GYM AT DOING DEAD 
LIFTS GUYS LIKE ME SPEND A LITTLE 
BIT OF THE TIME AT THE GYM BUT SHE 
NEEDED TO BE LEANER THESE GUYS ARE 
BIG

REALLY GOOD SWIMMERS COMING THROUGH

THIS TIME JUST THE WHOLE 
ATMOSPHERE BEEN IN BEIJING 
SWIMMING HAS MOVED ON SO MUCH JUST 
THE WHOLE EVENT IT WILL BE TOUGHER 
TO DO WHAT I DID LAST TIME BUT I 
AM EXCITED ABOUT THE CHALLENGE YOU YOU RECKON THERE WILL BE FIFTEEN GUYS IN THE 
WORLD THAT CAN GO UNDER THE WATER 
FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES 
THE ONLY FIVE GUYS 
WERE IN THE FINAL IN ATHENS YOU 
HAVE TO SWIM FASTER IN THE HEATS 
JUST TO GET THROUGH BUT HAVING THE 
COMPETITION MEANS 
YOU WILL 
PUSH 
EACH 
OTHER TO 
GO FAST 
YOU HAD 
A 
YOU HAD A CHANGE OF COACH 
SIX MONTHS 
AGO HOW 
WAS THAT GOING 
VERY GOOD L. WAS IN 
CARDIFF FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS L. 
WAS GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS AND 
IT GOT A BIT STALE L. NEEDED A 
CHANGE NOW I AM REALLY ENJOYING 
GOING TO THE POOL WITH THE SQUAD 
MY NEW COACH WE HAVE ALL DONE A 
LOT OF HARD WORK WE WENT TO 
AUSTRALIA THROUGH THE WINTER TO DO 
THE BASE WORK IT HAS ALL BEEN 
GOING VERY WELL IT IS ALL ABOUT 
THE SUMMER NOW TALKING ABOUT

TALKING ABOUT CARDIFF THEY ARE NOT 
DOING TOO BADLY IN THE FOOTBALL 
ABSOLUTELY I HAVE FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS THERE AS WELL IT IS A 
GREAT PLACE TO LIVE THE WELSH A 
CRAZIES ARE CRAZY ABOUT SPORT AND 
THEY WILL SUPPORT ANYTHING THEY 
CALL ME DIE SPLASH FOR SOME REASON 
I HAVE GOT A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM 
THEM HOPEFULLY I CAN MAKE THEM 
PROUD 
CARDIFF CITY IN THE FINAL OF THE F. A. 
CUP HE HAS PLENTY OF WELSH 
INSPIRATION WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING 
FOR FROM DAVID DAVIES HERE 
I THINK HE WILL WANT TO GET OUT 
VERY QUICK L. L. THINK PRILUKOV IS 
GOING TO BE HIS MAIN COMPETITION 
HE WAS RIGHT ON HIS BEST TIME IN 
THE FOUR HUNDRED METRE FREESTYLE WHERE HE 
WON THAT 
THE OTHER 
NIGHT 
I THINK 
HE WILL 
BE PRETTY 
CLOSE TO 
TONIGHT I 
DON'T THINK 
HE WILL 
VERY MUCH OUTSIDE THE WORLD RECORD 
DAVID IS REALLY 
GOING TO 
HAVE TO GO 
FOR IT LOOKING AT THE OLYMPIC 
COVERAGE JENSEN WHO IS IN LANE 
SEVEN FINISHED SECOND IN THAT 
EVENT TOO WE WILL WAIT TO SEE 
WHAT HE HAS IN THE TANK THERE IS A 
BIT OF TOUGH COMPETITION ACTUALLY ACTUALLY WE MIGHT BE TRYING TO EXPECT A 
LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH OF DAVID HERE 
HE IS CERTAINLY NOT FAVOURED TO WIN 
THIS HE 
HAS DONE A LOT OF HARD WORK 
HE HAS HAD TO GO TO THE BRITISH TRIALS HE SAID HIS OBJECTIVE IS THE 
OLYMPICS THAT IS THE RIGHT 
ATTITUDE HE WANTS TO PUT UP A GOOD 
FIGHT AND HOPEFULLY THE CRANBROOK 
PICK HIM UP WE ARE EXPECTING 
SOMETHING BUT NOT MIRACLES I 
GUESS YOU COULD SAY THE CROWD 
WILL PICK HIM UP 
HE MIGHT BE SAVING HIMSELF FOR A 
RACE AGAINST GRANT HACKETT IN 
SEVILLE IN THE OPEN WATER THAT THAT WILL BE INTERESTING L. WONDER HOW 
HE WILL DO AGAINST MR. HACKETT LANE 
ONE IN THIS FINAL HEAT OF THE MEN'S 
FOUR HUNDRED METRE FREESTYLE A HUGE OVATION 
FOR MICHAEL SYMES WORK THE TWENTY ONE 
YEAR OLD FROM LOUGHBOROUGH A 
HUGE OVATION FOR THE BRITISH CINEMA 
BAIRD THE TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD FROM 
LOUGHBOROUGH LOUGHBOROUGH THE BRITISH SWIMMER 
THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY 
INTERESTING FOR ME HE HAS BEEN 
QUITE ILL FOR QUITE A LONG TIME HE 
HAD SOME REAL PROBLEMS WITH HIS 
FEET HE HAS HAD SOME INFECTIONS 
WHICH HAVE REALLY DOGGED HIM FOR A 
LONG TIME HE IS BACK ON TRACK NOW 
I THINK 
ABSOLUTELY THINK RIGHT 
CALLED IT QUITE ACCURATELY DAVID 
WILL FIND IT QUITE DIFFICULT 
PRILUKOV IS GOING TO BE TOUGH TO 
BEAT HE LOOKS IN FANTASTIC SHAPE 
I THINK PRILUKOV IS GOING TO BE THE 
GUY TO BE HERE HE IS QUITE 
STUNNING FOUR HUNDRED METRE FREESTYLE HIS 
ENTRY TIME ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY NINE HE IS THE 
EUROPEAN RECORD HOLDER SURREY M. O. T. 
WHICH THE POLISH SWIMMER STILL 
NO POLISH SWIMMER HAS WON THIS 
EVENT 
A EUROPEAN JUNIOR CHAMPION THAT 
WAS THREE YEARS AGO HE IS IN THE 
CENTRE SO THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED METRE FREESTYLE THE 
FINAL HEAT TWO BRITISH SWIMMERS AT 
THE TOP A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE 
FOR EXPERIENCE FOR ONS WOULD HEAR 
IN ONE DAVID DAVIES IN TO FOR I 
UNSWORTH IN LANE ONE FOUR ANN'S 
WORK A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR A UNSWORTH HEAR IN LANE ONE THEY ARE DIFFERENT ATHLETE THE 
FIFTEEN HUNDRED METRE FREESTYLE IS A LONG WAY 
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN TO SAY YOU 
CANNOT CONCENTRATE ON THE DETAIL 
THERE ARE SOME GOOD STARTS THERE 
VERY INTERESTING ALL OF THIS SIDE 
HAS GONE OFF VERY QUICKLY THERE IS 
NOTHING THERE THE GUY WITH THE 
BOARD HOLDING IT OUT THE COUNTING 
BOARD THE ATHLETE CANNOT SEE IT 
QUITE A FEW SWIMMERS DO SOMETIMES 
HAVE PROBLEMS COUNTING NOT ONLY ON 
THIS FIFTEEN HUNDRED METRES FREESTYLE BUT ON 
QUITE A FEW OTHERS AS WELL 
IT IS 
NOT HARD ON TO LENSE BUT CERTAINLY 
FOUGHT THE IT IS NOT HARD ON TO 
LENSE BUT CERTAINLY FOR THE LONGER 
ONES TWO RELENTS THE BRITISH AND US ARE AT THE TOP 
THERE DAVID DAVY IS IN SEVEN OR 
EIGHT POSITION THE BRITISH 
SWIMMERS ARE AT THE TOP THERE 
DAVID DAVIES IS IN SEVEN OR EIGHT 
POSITION HE IS HAVING A GOOD LUCK 
I REALLY THINK THAT IN THESE EVENTS 
IF YOU HAVE NOT GOT IT AT THE TANK 
IN THE TANK IT IS HARD HE IS 
HAVING GOOD LUCK PRILUKOV IS THE 
FIRST TO TURN 
HIS FOUR HUNDRED METRE 
FREESTYLE WAS VERY GOOD INDEED 
THERE IS PRILUKOV L. DO LIKE HIS 
STROKE INTERESTING TO HEAR GRANT 
TALK ABOUT THE STROKE TECHNIQUE ON 
THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED BETA FREESTYLE THERE ARE 
A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO IT 
FIFTEEN HUNDRED METRE FREESTYLE THERE IS THE 
CAT'S PAW LIKE A CAT PLAYING AT 
THE END OF A PIECE OF STRING CAN 
YOU MAKE A COMMENT ON THIS ABOUT 
THE TECHNIQUES HOW THEY DIFFER 
MAYBE 
IT IS INTERESTING IT DOES MAYBE NOT REALLY COUNT WHAT YOU DO ON TOP 
OF THE WATER IT IS MORE WHAT YOU 
DO 
UNDER THE 
WATER IT IS WHAT KIND 
OF RHYTHM SUITS YOU THESE RACES 
ARE DIFFERENT TO THE SPRINT RACES 
FOR STUDY HAVE TO SEE WHAT WORKS 
FOR YOU WHAT KEEPS IT GOING WALL 
TO WALL 
AND SUSTAINING THE 
WALL TO WALL AND SUSTAINING THE SAME PACE YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT 
WORKS FOR YOU IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO 
HERE PRILUKOV WAS RIGHT AT HIS 
BEST IN THE FOUR HUNDRED METRE FREESTYLE HE 
LOOKS PRETTY COMFORT THOUGH AT THIS 
STAGE COMFORTABLE THERE IS DAVID DAVIES ON THE RIGHT 
HAND SIDE HE WENT OFF 
EXTRAORDINARILY SLOWLY WONDER IF 
IT WAS TACTICAL WHEN YOU'RE DOING 
FIFTEEN HUNDRED METRES FREESTYLE GRANT YOU 
GO FROM THE FRONT AND PRILUKOV SON 
IS AT THE SAME BUT HERE DAVID 
DAVIS IS THEM INDIFFERENTLY 
MY TWO HUNDRED FOUR 
HUNDRED ARE QUICKER SONG QUICKER 
THAN SOME OF THEIR SPEEDS SO WHY 
USE IT THEN I TRY AND SLIP IT INTO 
A RHYTHM DAVID IS IN THE MIDDLE OF 
HARD WORK HE HAS BEEN TRAINING 
EXTREMELY HARD AND HAS TOLD ME 
ABOUT THIS YOU DON'T WANT TO GO 
OUT TOO FAST AND USE THE LIMITED 
AMOUNT OF SPEED YOU HAVE BEEN HARD 
WORK I DON'T THINK DAVID HAD THE 
SPEED BUT HE KNOWS HE HAS GOT 
FITNESS AND RHYTHM L. THINK THESE 
GUYS CAN GO OUT HARD BUT I MUST 
FIND MY PASTE IT IS WORKING FOR 
HIM FIFTEEN HUNDRED METRES IS NOT ONE ON THE 
FIRST ONE HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED YOU HAVE TO BE 
ABLE TO HOLD THAT PAYS DAVID IS 
DOING THAT WELL 
PRILUKOV IS 
HOLDING FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO AT THE MOMENT HE IS 
SETTLING INTO SOMETHING THERE 
DAVID DAVIS WAS A SEVENTH AFTER THREE 
LEGS HE IS COMING UP IN TWO SECOND 
THAT IS TWENTY LENGTHS DOWN PRILUKOV IS LEAVING DAVID DAVIES 
AT THE TOP IS IN SECOND PLACE WITH 
THE OTHER COMPETITOR THIS IS A 
COMFORTABLE FIRST TWO HUNDRED METRES 
PRILUKOV SEEMS TO HAVE SEEN THEM 
DAVIES IS UNDERNEATH HIS BRITISH 
RECORD SPLITS EVEN THEN AT FOUR HUNDRED 
HE WAS UNDER THE BRITISH RECORD AND 
IS NOW BRIDGING THE GAP WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL GAP 
BETWEEN THE BEING A CHASING CUP 
CHASING SUMMER AND THE LEADER IT 
LOOKS LIKE EVERY NOW AND THEN 
DAVID DAVIES IS LOOKING UP TO SEE 
WHERE PRILUKOV IS GRANT DO YOU 
LOOK AROUND TO SEE WHERE YOUR 
COMPETITORS ARE 
THAT IS ONE THING 
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF IF YOU 
START LOOKING AT OTHER GUYS TOO 
MUCH IT CAN BREAK YOUR RHYTHM L. HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF THIS RECENTLY YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 
YOU ARE FOCUSED ON WHAT YOU'RE 
DOING YOUR OWN RHYTHM YOUR OWN 
PLACE IN THE RACE DON'T GET CAUGHT 
UP IN IT 
YURIY PRILUKOV LOOKING 
PRETTY COMFORTABLE AT THE MOMENT 
IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS MADE ANOTHER 
MOVE PRILUKOV ABOUT FIVE METRES 
AHEAD OF DAVID DAVIS PRILUKOV OVER 
FIRST THERE IS NOW CLEAR WATER 
BETWEEN DAVID DAVIS AND THE 
AMERICAN SWIMMER WE ARE AT THE HALFWAY MARK OF THE 
SAMOANS AT TWO HUNDRED METRE FREESTYLE 
YURI PRILUKOV IS SWIMMING VERY WELL 
INDEED HE IS JUST OUTSIDE THAT 
PLACE AT THE MOMENT BUT HAS PICKED 
IT UP A LITTLE BIT THERE IS DAVID 
DAVIS FROM GREAT BRITAIN WHO IS 
CHANGED TRAINED IN CARDIFF 
ALTHOUGH HE HAS MOVED TO LEFT 
RECENTLY TRAINING IN THE CENTRE 
THERE HE IS UNDER THE BRITISH 
RECORD PLAYERS AT THE MOMENT DAVID 
DAVIS HE LOOKS QUITE GOOD AFTER 
THAT FAIRLY COMFORTABLE IT 
WORRIES ME WHEN HE GOES OFF SO SLOW 
BUT HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HE IS 
DOING HE GOT A BRONZE MEDAL AT THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES AGAIN HAVING A BIG 
LOOK UP THERE HE IS NOW TWO 
SECONDS UNDERNEATH HIS BRITISH 
RECORD PACE HE IS ON FOR A BRITISH 
RECORD 
PRILUKOV IS OFF HACKETT RECORD WORLD RECORD BY TEN SECONDS SO 
THAT'LL BE O. K. 
PRILUKOV IS LEADING 
AND IT IS GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER 
HERE GRANT WHEN YOU ARE SWIMMING 
FIFTEEN HUNDRED METRES FREESTYLE YOU GO 
SMOOTHLY OR DO YOU MAKE MOVES I I GUESS DIFFERENT RACES HAVE 
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES YOU TRY AND 
MAKE MOVES AT SOME POINT FOR ME I 
USUALLY GO OUT HARD PUT RECENTLY 
I'VE GONE OUT SLOW AND FOCUS ON THE 
RHYTHM OF THE RACE A LITTLE BIT 
MORE IT DEPENDS HOW CLOSE THE 
RACES IF YOU ARE NECK AND NECK 
WITH SOMEONE YOU MIGHT WANT TO 
MAKE HIM OF THREE HUNDRED METRES OUT AND SEE 
IF YOU CAN CRACK THEM IT CAN VARY 
BUT CERTAINLY YURI PRILUKOV LOOKS 
QUITE COMFORTABLE AT THIS STAGE HE 
HAS INCREDIBLE TURNS THAT IS ONE 
OF HIS STRENGTHS IN SHORT COURSE 
HE CAN TAP INTO THE TURN AND GET 
BACK UP INTO HIS RHYTHM HE SEEMS 
TO BE MOVING AWAY FROM DAVID NOW 
BUT DAVID IS HAVING A GOOD SOUL HE 
IS IN HARD WORK AND HIS HAS BEEN 
FINISHING CLOSE BEHIND RECENTLY HE 
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD THIS IS HOW I 
WAS EXPECTING THE RACE TO PAN OUT 
IT WAS SCARY SEEING DAVID IN HIS 
FIRST TWO HUNDRED METRES WHEN HE WAS VERY 
CASUAL 
IF YOU WERE HIM NOW GRAD CASUAL WHAT WOULD YOU BE THINKING GRANT 
WELL I GUESS IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU 
HAVE NOT GOT TOO MUCH LEFT INTO THE 
TANK AND YOU SEE THAT YURI PRILUKOV 
HAS IT THAT HE JUST WANT TO 
CONSOLIDATE OPPOSITION MAKE SURE 
THAT YOU STAY ON YOUR PEERS DON'T 
LET THE OTHER GUYS DRAW TOO CLOSE 
TO YOU KEEP A BIT LEFT IN THE TANK 
FOR A SPRINT HOME 
PRILUKOV DOES 
LOOK GOOD NOW HAVE GOT TO SAY HE 
DOES NOT KICK TOO MUCH OF THE WALL 
BE NICE LONG GLIDE HE HAS VERY 
GOOD TERMS L. WONDER IF HE COULD 
USE THE WAS A LITTLE BIT BETTER 
PRILUKOV THAT SLIGHTLY LIMPING 
STROKE BREEDING TO HIS LEFT HAND 
SIDE HE IS AN HOUR ABOUT TWELVE METRES 
AHEAD OF DAVID DAVIS SHE IS NOW 
ABOUT TWELVE METRES AHEAD OF DAVID 
DAVIS 
DAVID DAVIES IS STILL TWO DAVIS SECONDS AND THE BRITISH RECORD PACE 
SO ON TRACK FOR A PERSONAL BEST 
IN THE TRAINING THAT HE IS IN AT 
THE MOMENT IT IS PRETTY GOOD TO 
SUCH A PERSONAL BEST HOPEFULLY HE 
CAN HOLD ON THAT 
THERE IS DAVID 
DAVIS IN LANE TWO HE HAS BEEN DOING FIFTY EIGHT PRETTY MUCH 
ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT IS NOT A 
BIG DIFFERENCE HALF SECOND IT 
ALL ADDS UP LADIES SIXTY LENGTHS IT IT WOULD BE A LOT TO ME HAD A SAY 
THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT HUMAN 
BEINGS THE DISTANCE SWIMMERS AND 
THE SPRINTERS L. COULD NEVER QUITE 
UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE COULD KEEP 
THIS UP AT THIS PAYS FOR SO LONG 
ITS SIXTY LENGTHS IN THIS SHORT COURSE 
POLL AND THE SPEED THEY ARE GOING 
AS WELL 
THIS IS A TOUGH EVENT THE 
PAIN STARTS TO KICK IN NOW YOU 
REALLY HAVE TO PULL FIGHT YOU 
REALLY HAVE TO FIGHT THROUGH THE 
PAIN BARRIER TO MAINTAIN THIS PACE 
IT IS NOW COMING TO THE END THE 
LAST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY METRES DAVID LOOKS GREAT 
THE HARD WORK THAT HE HAS BEEN IN 
THIS IS A FANTASTIC SLUM BY HIM 
FANTASTIC SWIMMER BY HIM THE PAIN 
WILL BE KICKING IN NOW PRILUKOV IS FALLING AWAY FROM THE 
FIELD HERE HE LOOKS VERY GOOD 
INDEED DAVID DAVIES IS IN LANE TWO 
AT THE TOP HE IS IN A SILVER MEDAL 
POSITION THERE HE IS HE IS NOW 
ABOUT TWENTY METRES BEHIND THIS IS 
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE STUFF HE WON THE 
EUROPEAN LONG COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
NOW HE WILL BE WORLD SHORT COURSE 
CHAMPION THIS IS VERY IMPRESSIVE 
SWIMMING 
HE HAS SWITCHED IT ON A SWIMMING LITTLE BIT HE IS DROPPING IT DOWN 
TO FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE HE KNOWS THE END IS INSIDE 
HE IS STARTING TO FINISH IT OFF IT 
HAS BEEN A RACE WHERE HE HAS BEEN 
OUT ON HIS OWN 
THREE LENGTHS TO GO 
AT THE STERN THIS IS THE FINAL 
HEAT OF THE LENS FITTING HUNDRED 
METRE FREESTYLE THEY CLEARLY DO 
YURIY PRILUKOV OF RUSSIA DAVID DAVIES HAS DROPPED 
SIGNIFICANTLY THE IS NOW TWENTY FIVE 
SECONDS OF THE BRITISH RECORD HE 
HAS BEEN HEARD OVER THIS LAST 
PERIOD OVER THE BRITISH RECORD 
YURI PRILUKOV THE TROUT CROWD IS 
STARTING TO CHEER HIM THIS IS 
NOWHERE NEAR GRANT HACKETT WORLD 
RECORD OF ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TEN BUT IT IS A VERY 
GOOD SWIM IT IS JUST OUTSIDE HIS 
EUROPEAN RECORD IT IS A 
CHAMPIONSHIP RECORD 
HERE COMES 
DAVID DAVIES FOR THE SILVER A GOOD 
TIME FROM HEM HIM THREE AND A 
HALF SECONDS OUTSIDE HIS BRITISH 
RECORD THE POLISH WOMAN GETS THE 
BRONZE PRILUKOV TOOK OFF IN 
TYPICAL PASSION FASHION AND 
THAT WAS THE END OF IT DAVID 
DAVIES IS SEEMS TO BE HURTING QUITE 
BADLY PRILUKOV LOOKS FAIRLY 
COMFORTABLE I THINK DAVID DAVIS 
MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE 
THERE IS HE 
AT ONE POINT HE WAS 
TWO SECONDS AND A BRITISH RECORD 
BUT I THINK IT WAS THE LAST FOUR HUNDRED 
METRES WHICH REALLY HIT REALLY 
HURT HE IS ALL RIGHT I THINK 
THAT LAST LITTLE BIT HIT HIM 
SOMETHING DIDN'T GO QUITE RIGHT 
THEY DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW ANYTHING 
GRANT AT THE END OF HIS RACE YEAH YEAH HE WAS SITTING IN A GOOD RHYTHM HE 
WENT OUT CASUALLY HE GOT INTO A 
RHYTHM AND TRIED TO PEG BACK 
PRILUKOV A LITTLE BIT FULL CREDIT 
TO PRILUKOV FOR HOLDING ON TO HIS 
PLAYS HE CONTROLLED HIS RACE KEPT 
HIS RHYTHM IT WAS HIS STRATEGY TO 
PULL AWAY LAST FIVE HUNDRED DAVID WAS 
PAYING FOR IN THE LAST FOUR HUNDRED METRES 
BUT THAT IS WHAT THIS PLAY WHAT 
THIS RACE IS ABOUT PAIN L. LIKE 
SEEING GUYS HIT AT THE END BECAUSE 
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TAKEN EVERYTHING 
OUT OF THEMSELVES 
THERE HAVE ONLY 
BEEN THREE SUMMERS TO WIN THIS RACE 
FIVE THREE TIMES IN A ROW GRANT 
HACKETT HAS HAD IT THREE TIMES AND 
PRILUKOV HAS HAD IT TWO THOUSAND FOUR TWO THOUSAND SIX AND 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HERE IN MANCHESTER YURI 
PRILUKOV A MASTERFUL DISPLAY OF 
FIFTEEN HUNDRED FREESTYLE SWIMMING THE SILVER 
TO DAVID DAVIS HE WAS ON A GOOD 
PLACE FOR ME AND IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO FIND OUT WHAT 
HAPPENED HE DROPPED OFF QUITE 
QUICKLY 
IT THINK IT IS SOMETHING QUICKLY TO DO WITH THE FACT HE SET OFF 
EASILY HE THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE TO 
BUILD IN TO IT WORK QUITE HARD IN 
THE MIDDLE SECTION IF YOU ARE IN

BRING THE RACE BACK CONFIRMATION CONFIRMATION OF THE RESULT THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME FINISHING

AND TWENTY FOUR IN TOTAL MICHAEL SCOTT THE PERFORMANCE 
DIRECTOR FOR BRITISH SWIMMING HAS 
JOINED ME NOW HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP 
THE WEEK 
IT HAS BEEN A GREAT TWO WEEKS WITH 
THE TRIALS MOST IMPORTANT TO ME IS 
THE WAY THEY HAVE RACED OBVIOUSLY 
MEDALS ARE AN INDIVIDUAL 
RECOGNITION EMOTIONALLY LAST WEEK 
WAS A VERY EMOTIONAL TIME AND THEY 
BACKED IT UP THIS WEEK AND THEY 
HAVE RACED CONSISTENTLY AND THEY 
HAVE RACED WELL THAT IS PLEASING 
BECAUSE THAT 
IS WHAT 
THEY WOULD 
HAVE TO DO 
IN BEIJING 
MONTHS' TIME 
IT IS 
HARD 
FOR YOU 
TO 
TAKE THE CONFIDENCE FROM 
THIS EVENT 
WHILE KEEPING IT IN PERSPECTIVE AND 
NOT ALLOWING 
US IN THE MEDIA TO GET 
TOO EXCITED I IMAGINE WE NEED 
ALLOWS HIM AS TO CELEBRATE SOME 
SUCCESSFUL START TO MAURER WE HAVE 
OUR OLYMPIC A ORIENTATION DAY 
AND WE DRAW THE LINE IN THE SAND 
THAT IS HISTORY TOMORROW WE 
HAVE OUR OLYMPIC OF ORIENTATION DAY 
IT IS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT HERE TO 
GET YOUR THOUGHTS WE WILL NOT GET 
YOU AT THE 
END OF 
IT ALL L. USE 
SOMEBODY WHO DOES NOT MIND PULLING 
INDIVIDUALS OUT OR WOULD YOU 
RATHER NOT HIGHLIGHT INDIVIDUALS 
WHO HAVE EXCELLED 
WE ARE A TEAM 
AND OUR PROCESS GOING FORWARD IS TO 
FOCUS ON THE PROCESS THAT WILL MAKE 
US IMPROVE FROM THE TRIALS TO 
BEIJING AS A TEAM GOING FORWARD 
WE WILL IDENTIFY HOW WE MAXIMISE 
OUR PERFORMANCES IN BEIJING AND THE 
LITTLE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS 
ON WHAT EACH INDIVIDUAL ATTLEE 
THEY HAVE BEEN SOME GREAT SWIMS AS 
I SAID THAT IS HISTORY NOW AND WE 
NEED TO SAY HOW DO WE GET BETTER 
EACH INDIVIDUAL ATHLETE WE NEED TO 
FOCUS ON THE PROCESS AND NOT WORRY 
ABOUT THE OUTCOME GUESS AS WELL 
BUILDING ON THAT SUCCESS FOR LONDON 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE NEED BIT OF THE AUSSIE 
GREAT AND GRANT YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE 
TO THIS CONVERSATION WE DO NOT 
HAVE GREAT TRADITION IN THIS SYSTEM AT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM 
DOES NOT ALLOW ENOUGH PEOPLE TO 
ACCESS SPORT 
I ABSOLUTELY YOU 
NEED TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE COMING 
THROUGH ABSOLUTELY KEEP THEM 
PROGRESSING FORWARD AND THE MOST 
IMPORTANT PART FROM HEREON NOW IS 
FOCUSING ON THE PROCESS NOT THE 
OUTCOME PREPARATION IS THE KEY TO 
GOOD RESULTS ANY TICKET GETTING 
GOOD RESULTS FROM NOW ON THAT WILL 
KEEP THE SPORT IN THE PUBLIC EYE 
AND MORALE UP 
HOW YOU ENJOYING THE 
JOB 
IT IS GREAT THE KEY THING IN JOB A SPORT LIKE SELLING IS THE PEOPLE 
WE HAVE SOME TALENTED YOUNG 
SWIMMERS IN PARTICULAR THE 
FEMALES REGRET GET A GREAT 
SUPPORT FROM U. K. SPORT MORE POOLS 
ARE BEING BUILT IN THE U. K. WE HAVE 
ALL THE INGREDIENTS TO MAKE A GOOD 
CAKE 
AND OUR 
JOB IS TO BAKE THE 
CAKE 
MICHAEL DID A RISKY THING HE CAKE SAID IF ANY OF YOU WIN A GOLD 
MEDAL IN A WORLD RECORD TIME I 
WOULD SHAVE MY HEAD 
I THINK HE 
WILL BE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF O. K. 
CERTAINLY IT IS WET SHAVING YOUR 
HEAD OFF FOR 
TOOK PLACE SHAVES 
TO CLOSE SHAVES 
DO YOU SET 
YOURSELF AND THE TEAM A MEDAL 
TARGET 
AGAIN GOING FORWARD IN TARGET TERMS OF MANAGING EXPECTATIONS MY 
CLEAR FOCUS IS NOT MAKING 
PREDICTIONS I WANT TO SUPPORT THE 
TEAM BY CONCENTRATING ON THE 
PROCESS GET THE PREPARATION RIGHT 
IF WE DO THAT THEN THE OUTCOMES 
WILL COME WHETHER THEY ARE MEDALS 
WHETHER THEY ARE PB IS IN HEATS OR 
MAKING SEMI FINALS P. B.'S IN THE 
HEATS FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO GET 
THE PROCESS RIGHT WE HAVE TO 
PREPARE THE SWIMMERS FOR BEIJING 
THE WHOLE WORLD WILL BE THERE IN 
FULL FLIGHT IN THE MOST 
COMPETITIVE COMPETITION YOU FACE 
EVERY FOUR YEARS 
WHAT WOULD YOU 
SAY IS THE KEY ELEMENT IN THE 
PREPARATION FOR BEIJING 
THE KEY 
THING IS MAKING IT INDIVIDUAL WE 
HAVE A TEAM OF THIRTY FIVE SWIMMERS RANGING 
FROM THIRTY FIVE TO SIXTEEN WE NEED TO WORK WITH 
EACH SWIMMER TO DETERMINE DO THINGS 
THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THEM 
WHETHER THAT IS EXTRA LONG COURSE 
TRAINING WHETHER IT IS SPECIFIC 
WEIGHTS PROGRAMME LRT IS WE NEED 
TO SIT DOWN AND WORKOUT WERE WILL 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THAT 
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL SO WE NEED TO 
MAKE THE PROCESS AN INDIVIDUAL ONE 
WE ARE BEING DROWNED OUT BY A 
MASSIVE ROAR BECAUSE THE GREAT 
BRITAIN FOR BY ONE HUNDRED METRE MEDLEY 
TEAM ARE JUST COMING OUT ON THE BOX 
LET US TAKE US THROUGH THIS TEAM 
MICHAEL WERE YOU SEEM TO HAVE 
ACHIEVED IS A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF 
PERFORMANCE WITH GREAT ENJOYMENT 
FACTOR AS WELL THERE IS WONDERFUL 
TEAM SPIRIT OUT THERE THAT IS THE 
MAGIC FORMULA CONGRATULATIONS IN IN IT IS THE SWIMMERS AND THE COACH

BRITISH TEAM HAS COME OUT REWIND IT IS A GREAT MOMENT THIS IN FRONT 
OF YOUR OWN CROWD AND A ROAR LIKE 
THAT HE CAN DO NOTHING ELSE BUT 
DRIVE YOU REALLY FORWARD IF THEY 
WE CAN TAKE UP A SECOND OFF EACH 
TIME THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN 
RACING IN FRONT OF YOUR HOME CROWD 
IT IS VERY RARE FOR US TO DO THIS 
HERE THEY ARE THE BRITISH TEAM 
NEXT 
TO AMERICA L. WOULD PREFER NOT TO BE NEXT TO AMERICA THEY ARE 
GOING TO BE QUICK LET US NOT 
FORGET BRAZIL THEY ARE PRETTY GOOD

TO PUT DISAPPOINTED NO WONDER HE 
IS HAPPY HIM AND HIS TEAM MATES 
HAVE TO STAND OR AFTER THEY HAVE 
DONE THEIR LEG AND WATCH AND WAIT

OF ENERGY THEY HAVE GOT ON THE 
OTHER PERSON HE CAME UP QUITE 
QUICKLY A TERRIBLE POSITION TO END 
UP BEING IN LOOK AT THAT 
HE TOOK 
ON THE ONE HUNDRED GUY AND BEAT HIM THAT

COMFORTABLE THAN THAT IT WAS A 
GREAT FINISH FOR THE AMERICAN HE 
REALLY REACHED AND TURNED ROUND 
LOOK AT THAT WHAT HAS GOLD MEAN 
WHAT HAS A RECORD MEAN A HUGE 
AMOUNT FOR THIS MAN THE BRITISH 
TEAM OF THE BRITISH TEAM HAVE 
ENDED UP IN FIFTH POSITION ANOTHER

LITTLE BIT TIRED BY THE END

THE AMERICANS AND THE RUSSIANS
