AT THE BOTTOM WITH A PRAYER OF 
BROGUES WE SPUT SPARKS ON SOCKS 
FLASHES AT THE SIDE A SMALL SOCK 
KNIFE WE HAVE A KILT WITH A SPORAN 
IN FRONT 
WHAT MAKES THE PIPES SO 
SPECIAL TO GALVANISE PEOPLE'S 
SPIRITS 
IT INSTILS THE EMOTION SPIRITS WHETHER HAPPY OR SAD TO GATHER IN 
THE CLANS AND SEND SOLDIERS TO WAR 
YOU'LL BE DOING THAT FOR OUR 
ENJOYMENT WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR 
YOU TO BE PLAYING AT THE TATTOO 
I'M VERY PROUD TO BE AT THE FRONT

NEXT ON THE ARENA IS THE MUSICAL 
RIDE OF THE HOUSEHOLD MOUNTED 
CAVALRY REGIMENT JOINING ME IS 
EDWARD OLVER AND RICHARD WAYGOOD 
I HAVE A WONDERFUL JOB I TRAIN THE 
RIDE DESIGN THE RIDE TRAIN THE 
SOLDIERS READY FOR THE RIDE ITSELF 
AND PUT THE MUSIC TO THE RIDE WHAT 
I SEE OVER THE WEEKS IS SOLDIERS 
WHO REALLY MOST OF THEM DON'T COME 
FROM AN EQUESTRIAN FAMILY BUT 
THEY'VE ONLY LEARNT TO RIDE FROM 
THE TIME THEY'VE BEEN IN THE 
FAMILIAR ARMY IN MOST CASES EIGHTEEN 
WEEKS THEN SIX MONTHS IN TRAINING 
OF THE OF THE RIDE YOU'LL SEE THIS 
EVENING TWENTY SIX PEOPLE ON PARADE ONLY 
FIVE OF THEM HAVE BEEN ON A MUSICAL 
RIDE BEFORE WHAT A WONDERFUL WAY 
TO SEE THE MATURITY ACT CALM IN 
FRONT OF A HUGE AUDIENCE TO BE 
DISCIPLINED AND ACT UNDER PRESSURE 
I THINK ED WILL ENLIGHTEN YOU MORE 
ON HOW THIS REFLECTS ON THE REST OF 
THEIR CAREER 
THEY ARE TRANSFERABLE 
SKILLS AREN'T THEY 
YEAH I THINK 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THEY'RE 
SOLDIERS AS WELL THEY'RE TRAINED 
SOLDIERS SO THEY GO ON OPERATIONS 
TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN A LOT OF 
THEM ARE YOUNG THEY'RE SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN 
YEARS OLD WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW 
IS TRAINING IN SOMETHING CALLED THE 
MUSICAL RIDE GETTING THE 
DISCIPLINE AND ALSO THE MANAGEMENT 
SKILLS THEY LEARN THE ABILITY TO 
ACT UNDER PRESSURE THE ABILITY TO 
ACT AS A TEAM THE ABILITY TO KEEP 
EVERYTHING IN VERY GOOD ORDER 
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE IN 
AFGHANISTAN IT MAY BECOME CRITICAL 
THAT THEIR RIFLE IS CLEAN THEIR 
VEHICLE WORKS AT THE APPROPRIATE 
TIME WHAT THEY LEARN AT 
KNIGHTSBRIDGE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR 
WHAT THEY MIGHT DO LATER ON IN 
OPERATIONS

ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK THAT YOU DO I I THINK IT IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT L. 
KNOW FROM A SOLDIER'S POINT OF VIEW 
THERE IS A DESIRE FOR APPRECIATIONS 
OBVIOUSLY WE HAD OURS IN WINDSOR
