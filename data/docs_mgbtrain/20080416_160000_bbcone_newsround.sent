COLORADO IN AMERICA WILDFIRES HAVE 
SCORED ONE THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND AT LEAST 
THREE PEOPLE HAVE DIED INCLUDING A 
PILOT WHOSE PLANE CRASHED INTO A 
MOTORWAY ELEVEN HUNDRED LOCALS HAVE BEEN 
LEFT TEMPORARILY HOMELESS AND THE 
TOWN OF ORDWAY NEXT TO A LITTER 
PROBLEM THAT IS SIMPLY OUT OF THIS 
WORLD WE KNOW WE CREATE TOO MUCH 
WAYS AND RUBBISH ON EARTH BUT IT 
TURNS OUT THERE IS ALSO A WHOLE LOT 
OF JUNK BUILDING UP IN SPACE WE 
KNOW LITTER IS A BIG PROBLEM ABOUT 
GETTING RID OF BITS OF RUBBISH IS 
PRETTY EASY FOR US YOU CAN EITHER 
RECYCLING OR PUT IT IN THE BIN BUT 
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T WANT 
SOMETHING ANY MORE UP IN SPACE IF 
THE RUBBISH IS SMALL IT CAN BE SENT 
BACK TO EARTH IN A SPACE SHUTTLE 
BUT IF IT'S TOO HEAVY IT IS LEFT UP 
THERE AND BECOMES SPACE JUNK 
SCIENTISTS HAVE RELEASED THESE 
GRAPHICS TO SHOW US HOW ALL THE 
SPACE JUNK SPINNING AROUND OUR 
PLANET MIGHT LOOK TENS OF MILLIONS 
OF BITS OF RUBBISH HAVE BEEN 
BUILDING UP OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS 
SOME OF THE BITTS PARK PIECES OF 
SPACECRAFT DEAD SATELLITES AND 
EVEN FLECKS OF LOOSE AND PAINT THAT 
ENDED FLOATING AROUND SOME OF IT 
IS THROWN OUT DELIBERATELY BY 
ASTRONAUTS LAST YEAR A CREW ON 
BOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE 
STATION HAD NO ROOM ON BOARD THEIR 
SHIP FOR AN OLD FRIDGE SO THEY TOOK 
IT OUT INTO SPACE ALTHOUGH MOST OF 
THE SPACE JUNK IS SMALL IT CAN BE 
QUITE DANGEROUS THAT'S BECAUSE IT 
TRAVELS ROUND THE EARTH VERY VERY 
FAST AT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES PER HOUR AT 
THAT SPEED EVEN A FLECK OF PAINT 
CAN DAMAGE A SPACE SHUTTLE AND THE 
STRIP DAY MISSION THE PROBLEM IS 
THERE IS NOT MUCH SCIENTISTS CAN DO 
ABOUT IT BLOWING THE JUMP UP JUST 
CREATES MORE BITS OF DEBRIS SO 
THEY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL A PIECE OF 
JUNK COMES CLOSE ENOUGH TO HER FOR 
IT TO BURN UP IN THE HEMISPHERE 
BUT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN 
ENOUGH SO CLEANING UP SPACE ISN'T 
GOING TO BE EASY TOP SPORTS
