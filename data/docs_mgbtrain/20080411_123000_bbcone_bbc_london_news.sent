BLAME NEW GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES IN 
CENTRAL LONDON ONE PRACTITIONER 
WHO HAS ABANDONED N. H. S. TREATMENTS 
SAYS PATIENTS REQUIRING N. H. S. 
TREATMENTS ARE NOT FINANCIALLY 
VIABLE VIABLE MEET DENNIS A FORMER ART COLLECTOR 
WAS HOMELESS FOR TEN YEARS A TINY 
WHICH IS HEALTH AND TEETH SUFFERED 
SEVERE NEGLECT ALCOHOLIC HE WAS 
PUNCHED IN THE MOUTH AND SUFFERED 
THE LOSS OF HIS TEETH 
THEY DON'T GET PAID ANY MORE FOR 
TREATING HIM THAN SOMEONE WHO NEEDS 
A SIMPLE FILLING HE HAS AGREED TO 
TEST TENTH OF LONDON'S DENTISTS FOR 
US US ATTRACTIVE TO DENTISTS IF A 
DENTIST FILLS THAT ACCEPTING A 
PATIENT IS GOING TO CAUSE PROBLEMS 
IN TERMS OF TIME ECONOMIC OUTLAY 
IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT THEY ARE 
GOING TO THINK I WISH THIS PATIENT 
HAD NOT COME IN 
WHEN DENNIS DID 
GOING FOUR DENTIST'S SUGGESTED HE 
MIGHT PREFER TO BE TREATED IN 
HOSPITAL WHERE HE WOULD GET BETTER 
ANAESTHETIC CARE ONE PRACTICE 
OFFERED A SURPRISINGLY LIGHT COURSE 
OF TREATMENT 
THEY SAID I NEEDED 
TWO TEETH OUT AND TWO FILLING SORT 
OF TWO EXTRACTION HAS AND TWO 
FILLINGS 
IS THAT ALL HE NEEDS A FILLINGS A WE ARE GOING TO DO CHECK UP TODAY 
WE ASKED HENRYK AT THE N. H. S. PRACTICE 
IN FULHAM FOR HIS ADVICE 
IN MY 
OPINION THE FIRST THING IS TO SEE 
THE HYGIENIST TO GET HIS HYGIENE 
BETTER HE NEEDS TWO TEETH TAKEN 
OUT IN THREE TO SIX MONTHS 
PROBABLY A NEW VENTURE 
THAT SOUNDS 
LIKE QUITE A LOT OF TREATMENT IS 
IT ALL AVAILABLE ON THE N. H. S. YES YES YOU CAN SEE MORE ON THAT STORY ON 
INSIDE OUT LONDON AT SEVEN THIRTY P. M. 
DANIELLE JOHNSON WAS SEVENTEEN WHEN SHE 
WAS STABBED AND BEATEN SO BADLY HER 
MOTHER COULD NOT RECOGNISE HER 
THIS AFTERNOON HER KILLER MARC 
KING BROMLEY WAS SENTENCED TO TWELVE 
YEARS IN JAIL FOR HER MURDER WHICH 
TOOK PLACE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN 
BOUNDS GREEN 
METROPOLITAN POLICE OFFICERS ARE TO 
BE ELECTRONICALLY TAGGED SO THEN 
MOVEMENTS AND EXACT LOCATION CAN BE 
MONITORED THE NET SAY THE PUT 
THE NET SAY IT WILL TRY TO DEPLOY 
OFFICERS MORE EFFICIENTLY 
THERE ARE SIGNS THAT THE TIGHTENING 
UP OF LOANS IN THE HOUSING MARKET 
HAS STARTED TO HIT THE PRICES OF 
PROPERTIES IN LONDON AND THE HOME 
COUNTIES NO ONE CAN PREDICT WHAT 
WILL HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT FEW 
MONTHS BUT WITH THE POWER SHIFTING 
FROM CELLAR TO BUY A NO ONE CAN 
PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN BY A 
SAINT ALBANS ONE OF THE MOST SOUGHT 
AFTER PLACES TO LIVE IN THE SOUTH 
EAST WHERE ONCE BUYERS WERE 
FIGHTING OVER TWO BEDROOMED 
COTTAGES FOR MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND 
BUT ALL IS NOT WELL INSIDE THE 
HISTORIC WALLS CHRISTINA MADDEN 
HAS HAD HER PROPERTY ON THE MARKET 
FOR SIX MONTHS AND EVEN DROPPING 
THE PRICE BY FORTY THOUSAND HAS MADE NO 
DIFFERENCE SHE THINKS GORDON BROWN 
SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO HELP I I THINK HE SHOULD HAVE ABOLISHED 
STAMP DUTY FOR FIRST TIME BUYERS 
THAT WOULD HAVE GOT THEM INTO THE 
MARKET THEY WOULD PUSH THE OTHER 
PEOPLE FORWARD AND IT WOULD HAVE 
HELPED EVERYBODY 
SAINT ALBANS HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN POPULAR WITH HOUSE 
BUYERS WITH GREAT LINKS INTO 
LONDON BUT ESTATE AGENTS ARE 
ADVISING PEOPLE TO BE REALISTIC AND 
MANY NOW ACCEPT THINGS COULD GET 
WORSE 
THEY ARE LISTENING TO WHAT WORSE IS HAPPENING IN THE FINANCIAL 
MARKETS AND THEY ARE BEGINNING TO 
REALISE THAT PERHAPS THEY SHOULD 
COME TO THE MARKET NOW RATHER THAN 
WAIT TILL THE SUMMER WHEN PRICES 
MAY BE AFFECTED MORE BY THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH 
SOME REPORTS SUGGEST THAT CRUNCH IN LONDON THINGS ARE HOLDING UP A 
LITTLE BETTER BUT THAT HAS NOT 
BEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF SUZANNE AND 
PETER FROM MUSWELL HILL WHO ARE 
STILL WAITING FOR A PROPERTY AND 
OFF ON THEIR PROPERTY AFTER SIX 
MONTHS 
A WE FEEL WE HAVE MISSED MONTHS THE BOAT IF WE PUT THE HOUSE ON 
THE MARKET LAST YEAR IT WOULD HAVE 
FLOWN OUT OF THE DOOR 
THEY WERE 
GOING LITERALLY IN A WEEK SOME SOME HOUSES WILL ALWAYS SELL MORE EASILY 
THAN OTHERS BUT AFTER SO MANY 
YEARS OF GROWTH DROPPING THE PRICE 
OF YOUR HOUSE IS NEVER GOING TO BE
