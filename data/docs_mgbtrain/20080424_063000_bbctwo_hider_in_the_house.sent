GREAT DAD'S ON HIS WAY OUT I CAN FEEL MORE CHALLENGES COMING ON 
HE'S LEFT THE HOUSE COAST IS CLEAR 
LET'S GET IN FOR CHALLENGE TWO 
CHALLENGE TWO ARE YOU READY YEAH 
GNOMES ARE EVIL HORRIBLE NASTY CREATURES 
THEY'RE NOT WHEN YOU'RE ASLEEP 
THEY PECK YOUR NOSE AND FACE AND PECK YOUR EYES 
DON'T WORRY NO THEY DON'T THEY DO 
NO THEY DON'T NO THEY DON'T 
MAYBE THE GNOMES YOU KNOW DON'T BUT IN MY PAST I'VE HAD HORRIBLE GNOMES 
IT'S TIME FOR A BIT OF GNOME BOWLING 
WE'D LIKE TO STOP THE SHOW TO POINT OUT THAT GNOMES AREN'T EVIL 
BUT GENTLE CREATURES JOEL IS JUST JEALOUS OF THEIR POPULARITY 
ANYWAY BACK TO THE GAME 
IN THE LIVING ROOM THERE ARE SIXTEEN GNOMES 
ONE OF WHICH IS THE WISE GOLDEN GNOME OF POWER 
THE OTHERS ARE HIS BODYGUARDS 
THE CHILDREN AND CHARLIE HAVE TWO VEG 
TO KNOCK DOWN ALL THE GNOMES OTHER THAN THE GOLDEN GNOME 
IF THEY KNOCK GOLDIE DOWN THE GAME IS OVER AND THEY DON'T WIN THE BOOKS 
HE'S GONE FOR THE CABBAGE 
I WOULD START WITH THE TURNIP I'D GO FOR THE CABBAGE 
HE'S GONE FOR THE CABBAGE AND LEO IS DISCUSSING TACTICS 
ON WHICH GNOME TO KNOCK OVER FIRST 
THAT WAS A VERY TRICKY MOMENT 
THREE GNOMES OVER THE GOLDEN GNOME NEARLY WENT 
A FINE LINE BETWEEN GENIUS AND MADNESS 
MEANWHILE DAD IS ENJOYING A ROUND OF GOLF 
HE'S ALREADY MOVED ON TO THE SEVENTH HOLE 
HE NEEDS SOME WORK ON THAT SWING 
WE NOW HAVE FOUR GNOMES DOWN 
SECOND THROW FOR AMELIA 
CAREFUL DON'T WANT TO RUIN THIS HOUSE 
SHE'S GONE FOR THE TURNIP A STRANGE CHOICE 
THE PROBLEM IS A CABBAGE IN THE WAY 
WE HAVE A TURNIP IN THE WAY 
OSSY'S JUST THAT WAS A THROW 
A THROW FROM LEO 
I'VE GOT CONFIRMATION YOU ARE ALLOWED ESPECIALLY BROCCOLI 
DAD'S GAME IS GOING WELL HE'S ALMOST AT THE FINAL HOLE 
THAT WAS JUST PURE VIOLENCE 
THAT WAS VIOLENT LEO NOT JUST AN OVER ARM THROW 
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS THROWING A CRICKET BALL 
HERE HE GOES 
HE'S LINING IT UP AND 
HE'S KILLED A GNOME 
HE HAS BROKEN A GNOME IN TWO 
THAT'S BRILLIANT THAT'S AWFUL 
I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT 
THE GNOME SPLITS IN TWO 
TWO WEAPONS AND ONE CHARLIE DIMMOCK 
IT'S THE DIMMOCK MEISTER 
THE CABBAGE HAS KNOCKED ONE GNOME DOWN STILL TWO STANDING 
ONE THROW LEFT AND SHE HAS TO KNOCK BOTH DOWN 
I'VE ONLY SEEN THE DOUBLE DONE ONCE BEFORE 
DIFFICULT TENSE MOMENT 
IT'S THE FINAL THROW 
SO CLOSE 
ONE STUBBORN GNOME REMAINS 
THEY'VE LOST THE PRIZES 
THEY COULD WIN THEM BACK IF THE FORFEIT IS ACCEPTED 
IT'S A NICE LOOK 
TO WIN THE PRIZES CHARLIE MUST UNDERTAKE THIS WEEK'S FORFEIT 
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO GO FOR IT
