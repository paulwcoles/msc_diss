THROUGH THE CENTURIES TO EXPLORE SPACE WAS AN IMPOSSIBLE FANTASY 
THEN TWO RIVAL SCIENTISTS BECAME LOCKED IN A RACE 
TO REALISE THAT DREAM 
THEIR STRUGGLE WOULD MAKE HISTORY 
SERGEI KOROLEV WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON TO BECOME CHIEF DESIGNER 
OF THE SOVIET SPACE PROGRAMME 
HE LAUNCHED THE WORLD'S FIRST SATELLITE 
IT'S JUST BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE PUT A SATELLITE INTO SPACE 
AND YURI GAGARIN THE FIRST MAN INTO SPACE 
DESPITE ALL HIS SUCCESS KOROLEV'S IDENTITY WAS A CLOSELY GUARDED STATE SECRET 
THESE PICTURES COMING LIVE FROM MOSCOW 
IN AMERICA HIS RIVAL WERNHER VON BRAUN WAS STRUGGLING TO CATCH UP 
THE SOVIETS MAY BE READY TO GO AS SOON AS NOVEMBER 
WE CAN'T WASTE TIME TRUCKING THIS CAPSULE FROM STATE TO STATE WHILE THE REDS ARE ORBITING THE EARTH 
AND YOU PREFER WE KILL AN ASTRONAUT 
NOW WITH THE LAUNCH OF AMERICA'S FIRST ASTRONAUT VON BRAUN IS CLOSING THE GAP 
AND WITH THE CREATION OF NASA 
GO BABY GO THE MOON IS IN HIS SIGHTS 
THE EYES OF THE WORLD NOW LOOK INTO SPACE 
WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON IN THIS DECADE AND DO THE OTHER THINGS 
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD 
COME ON COME ON LET'S GET ON WITH IT SERGEI KOROLEV'S ROLE 
AS CHIEF DESIGNER IS A WELL KEPT SECRET IN THE SOVIET UNION 
WHILE EVERYTHING DONE BY HIS RIVAL IN AMERICA IS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE 
PROJECT APOLLO DESTINATION MOON 
WHAT ROCKET WILL TAKE THESE MEN AND FUTURISTIC APOLLO CRAFT TO THEIR DESTINATION 
LET'S HEAR ABOUT ITS DESIGN FROM THE WORLD FAMOUS ROCKET DESIGNER DOCTOR WERNHER VON BRAUN 
AT OVER THREE FIFTY F. T. LONG THE SATURN V. WILL BE A GIANT AMONG ROCKETS 
ITS WEIGHT EQUIVALENT TO A LIGHT BATTLE CRUISER 
WILL BE LIFTED INTO THE AIR BY A FIRST STAGE OF FIVE ENGINES 
PRODUCING OVER SEVENTY FIVE MILLION L. B. S. OF THRUST 
ENOUGH TO LAUNCH OVER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SPUTNIKS INTO ORBIT 
S. SH 
THE SPACE AGE HAS TRULY ARRIVED SPACE EXPLORATION IS NECESSARY FOR A DYNAMIC AMERICA 
AND ESSENTIAL FOR THE PRESERVATION OF PEACE 
BOTH MEN HAVE DREAMED OF GOING TO THE MOON FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS 
BUT KOROLEV CAN'T WIN BACKING FOR HIS LUNAR ROCKET 
THE MONEY THEY MUST HAVE 
WE CAN'T EVEN GET OUR PLANS FOR A LUNAR MISSION APPROVED NEVER MIND THE FUNDS 
THAT VON BRAUN IS SUCH A LUCKY DEVIL FIRST THE NAZIS THEN THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT 
YOU MAY LAUGH VASILY BUT HE WILL FLY HIS BATTLE CRUISER 
OUR N. ONE IS UNLIKELY TO EVEN LIFT OFF THE DESIGN BOARD THE POLITBURO SAY THEY WANT LUNAR MISSION 
THEY KNOW WE MUST HAVE A POWERFUL BOOSTER LIKE THE N. ONE OR THE SATURN IF WE ARE TO DO IT 
DO THEY DO THEY REALLY VASILY 
OR DO THEY EXPECT US TO PULL IT OUT OF THE BAG LIKE WE ALWAYS DO 
WITHOUT A ROCKET AS POWERFUL AS THE SATURN WE WILL LOSE 
THE SATURN'S ENGINES WORK ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS ALL ROCKET ENGINES OF WHICH THIS IS AN EXAMPLE 
THE CRUCIAL PART OF THE DESIGN IS THE INJECTOR PLATE 
LIKE A GIANT SHOWERHEAD SPRAYING FUEL INTO THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER WHERE IT IGNITES 
IT'S A PROCESS THAT HAS TO BE ABSOLUTELY PRECISE OR THE ENGINE FAILS 
ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE 
IMAGINE THAT AT THOUSANDS OF TIMES THE FEROCITY 
WITH FUEL DELIVERED AT A RATE SUFFICIENT TO FILL A FAMILY SIZED SWIMMING POOL EVERY TEN SECONDS 
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO ACHIEVE ON THE F. ONE 
THE MOST POWERFUL ROCKET ENGINE EVER BUILT 
FAIL AND WE DON'T GO TO THE MOON 
SO WE'RE TESTING 
ENGINE NUMBER OH OH EIGHT WITH INJECTOR PLATE F. THREE SIXTY SEVEN 
SENIOR ENGINEER PAUL CASTENHAUS HAS BEEN TESTING THE ENGINE FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS 
UH YES SIR THAT'S UH OH OH EIGHT AND PLATE F. THREE SIXTY SEVEN 
BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS GETTING THE AMBITIOUS DESIGN TO WORK AT ALL 
EVERYONE CLEAR THE STAND 
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ABOUT READY BETTER GET TO THE BLOCKHOUSE 
STAND BY FOR ENGINE TEST TURBO PUMP SEQUENCE INITIATED 
PREPARE FOR ENGINE IGNITION IN TEN NINE EIGHT SEVEN 
INSIDE THE ENGINE THE INJECTOR PLATE IS THE MOST CRITICAL PART OF THE DESIGN 
IT MIXES THE LIQUID FUELS TOGETHER THROUGH THOUSANDS OF TINY HOLES 
AS THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF LIQUID OXYGEN AND KEROSENE BURN 
THE GASES EXPAND TO CREATE INTENSE PRESSURE 
THE SMALLEST UPSET TO THIS SMOOTH MIX WILL LEAD TO A ROCKET DESIGNER'S WORST NIGHTMARE 
COMBUSTION INSTABILITY 
ALL IT TAKES IS THE SLIGHTEST THING 
KEEP ME POSTED ON MODIFICATIONS FOR THE NEXT TEST 
VON BRAUN WOULD NEED FIVE OF THESE ENGINES PERFECTLY SYNCHRONISED 
JUST TO LIFT HIS SATURN OFF THE GROUND 
IT'S NEVER GONNA WORK AT THAT SIZE 
WELL IT'LL HAVE TO OR HE SURE AS HELL ISN'T GOING TO THE MOON 
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU TRIED THIS 
HE'LL NEVER MAKE PEACE WITH YOU 
BECAUSE HE'S JEALOUS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN 
I KNOW BUT I NEED HIM AND HE KNOWS IT 
HIS ENGINES LAUNCHED GAGARIN SPUTNIK HE KNOWS LAUNCHING THE N. ONE WILL BE NO DIFFERENT 
THE POLITBURO WILL STILL NOT FUND KOROLEV'S LUNAR ROCKET THE N. ONE 
TO HELP PERSUADE THEM HE NEEDS THE SOVIET'S LEADING ROCKET ENGINE DESIGNER 
VALENTIN GLUSHKO A MAN WHO HAS LONG COVETED KOROLEV'S SUCCESS 
I HAVE MADE MY POSITION COMPLETELY CLEAR TO THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND TO THE POLITBURO 
MY ANSWER IS NO UNLESS YOU CHANGE FUELS 
WHICH YOU WON'T SO THERE'S THE END OF THE DISCUSSION 
YOU KNOW I CAN'T AGREE TO THAT YOUR FUEL IS TOO TOXIC THE SMELL ALONE IS ENOUGH TO KILL SOMEONE 
ANYWAY TO ABANDON LIQUID OXYGEN NOW WOULD KILL THE N. ONE WE DON'T HAVE TIME 
YOU HAVE SEEN VON BRAUN'S SATURN HE USES OXYGEN 
I DIDN'T SEE IT FLY ARE WE GOING TO THE MOON OR NOT 
NOT ON LIQUID OXYGEN USING LARGE ENGINES 
A SCHOOLBOY CAN TELL YOU THE PROBLEMS YOU WILL GET WITH COMBUSTION INSTABILITY 
THIS IS NOT ABOUT FUEL IS IT VALENTIN 
THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND ME 
I KNOW HOW YOU TALK BEHIND MY BACK HOW YOU POISONED MY RELATIONS WITH KHRUSHCHEV 
AND NOW YOU DO THE SAME WITH THE POLITBURO AND BREZHNEV 
GET OUT 
YOU CANNOT STAND IT WHEN I SUCCEED 
YOU'LL DO ANYTHING TO DESTROY MY CHANCES 
LEAVE NOW 
WITH PLEASURE VALENTIN PETROVICH 
IF YOU DON'T WANT THE JOB I WILL GET BY WITHOUT YOU 
THAT COULD HAVE GONE BETTER I THOUGHT YOU SAID THE POLITBURO 
WILL NEVER AGREE TO FUNDS IF YOU DON'T HAVE GLUSHKO 
I'LL MANAGE I HAVE ANOTHER MAN IN MIND 
SERGEI WHAT'S HAPPENING 
I'M ALL RIGHT LET'S JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE 
TAKE US STRAIGHT HOME 
WITH THE ENTIRE MOON SHOT RESTING ON THE SUCCESS OF HIS ENGINES 
VON BRAUN TAKES A RADICAL STEP 
A SMALL BOMB IS PLANTED IN THE ENGINE TO DELIBERATELY TRIGGER INSTABILITY 
STAND BY FOR ENGINE TEST 
TURBO PUMP SEQUENCE INITIATED 
IF THE ENGINE COPES WITH THE SHOCKWAVES CAUSED BY THE BOMB HE WILL KNOW HE'S SOLVED IT 
FIRING CHARGE MARK 
ALL THIS FAILURE IS TURNING PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST VON BRAUN 
HOW DO YOU ANSWER THOSE WHO SAY YOU'RE USING THE TAX DOLLARS OF THE POOR TO FATTEN RICH CORPORATIONS 
WE DON'T SPEND THE MONEY ON THE MOON WE SPEND IT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES CREATING JOBS AND PRODUCTS 
GATHER ROUND WHILE I SING YOU OF WERNHER VON BRAUN 
A MAN WHOSE ALLEGIANCE IS RULED BY EXPEDIENCE 
CALL HIM A NAZI HE WON'T EVEN FROWN 
NAZI SCHMAZI SAYS WERNHER VON BRAUN 
DON'T SAY THAT HE'S HYPOCRITICAL 
SAY RATHER THAT HE'S APOLITICAL 
ONCE THE ROCKETS ARE UP WHO CARES WHERE THEY COME DOWN 
THAT'S NOT MY DEPARTMENT SAYS WERNHER VON BRAUN 
COMPONENTS ARE REDESIGNED AND THEN TEST FIRED AT A COST OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
UNTIL VON BRAUN AT LAST GETS WORD OF A BREAKTHROUGH 
EXCELLENT PAUL THANK YOU THANK YOU 
SO WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM 
FRANKLY SIR UH I STILL DON'T KNOW 
BUT IT HAS BEEN RESOLVED 
WELL WE FOUND THE DESIGN OF INJECTOR PLATE THAT CURES THE INSTABILITY 
WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE 
BUT IT COULD RE OCCUR 
HE HAS TO BUILD THE ENGINES WITH NO GUARANTEE THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED 
WHY THE RUSH THE RUSSIANS APPEAR TO BE DOING NOTHING DON'T BE FOOLED 
THE SOVIETS UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CONQUERING SPACE 
THEY WANNA BEAT US TO THE MOON AND THEY MAY SURPRISE US ANY DAY NOW 
THIS IS DIAMOND ONE 
I AM READY TO GO OUT 
JUST AS VON BRAUN FEARS KOROLEV IS READY WITH ANOTHER HISTORIC FIRST 
SOVIET COSMONAUT ALEKSEI LEONOV 
BECOMES THE FIRST MAN TO WALK IN SPACE 
DIAMOND ONE CALLING DAWN 
EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL 
BELOW ME I CAN SEE CLOUDS SEA 
THE CAUCUSES 
I CAN SEE THE CAUCUSES BELOW ME 
KOROLEV HOPES THAT THE SPACE WALK'S IMPACT 
WILL HELP PERSUADE THE POLITBURO TO FUND HIS PLANS FOR A LUNAR MISSION 
THE SUIT IS PERFORMING WELL 
DIAMOND ONE THIS IS DAWN 
YOU HAVE ACHIEVED YOUR OBJECTIVES RETURN TO THE SPACECRAFT 
THE AIR PRESSURE IN MY SUIT IS INCREASING 
I CAN BARELY MOVE MY FINGERS IN MY GLOVES 
I CAN'T PULL MYSELF 
BACK TO THE AIRLOCK 
GOD DAMN IT 
LEONOV'S SUIT IS SO INFLATED HE WILL NEVER FIT BACK THROUGH THE AIRLOCK 
ALEKSEI TRY USING THE RELEASE VALVE TO MANUALLY VENT AIR FROM THE SUIT 
OH 
HE STRUGGLES FOR TWELVE MINUTES AT THE AIRLOCK 
WITH ONE LAST PUSH HE FINALLY MANAGES TO CLIMB BACK INTO THE SPACECRAFT 
TODAY THE SOVIET UNION ANNOUNCED SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE FIRST WALK IN SPACE 
PILOT COSMONAUT LIEUTENANT COLONEL ALEKSEI ARKHIPOVICH LEONOV 
SPENT TWENTY THREE MINUTES AND FORTY ONE SECONDS OUTSIDE HIS SPACECRAFT 
THE POLITBURO NEVER REVEAL HOW CLOSE THE MISSION CAME TO DISASTER 
VON BRAUN CAN ONLY ASSUME THE SOVIETS ARE AHEAD 
WATCHING FROM RUSSIA KOROLEV KNOWS THIS IS FAR FROM TRUE 
THE INDUSTRIAL MIGHT OF AMERICA IS NOW FOCUSED ON NASA'S LUNAR PROGRAMME 
IN ASSEMBLY BUILDINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
THE GIGANTIC SATURN V. IS TAKING SHAPE 
IN HIGH ALTITUDE TESTS ASTRONAUTS ARE TRAINING FOR EACH STEP OF A MOON MISSION 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE ALONE NASA HAS BEEN ALLOCATED A FURTHER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS 
TO SPEARHEAD ITS CONQUEST OF SPACE 
IT'S HERE 
VASILY I HAVE IT 
WE HAVE APPROVAL FOR A CIRCUMLUNAR FLIGHT ON THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REVOLUTION 
AND A MANNED LANDING WITHIN THREE YEARS 
NOW WE CAN MOVE THE N. ONE INTO FULL PRODUCTION ALTHOUGH 
THEY HAVE ALLOCATED HALF THE FUNDS WE ASKED FOR 
TELL THEM TO COME IN 
AT LAST KOROLEV HAS THE GO AHEAD TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THE AMERICAN MOON MISSION 
BUT WITH ONLY A FACTION OF THE MONEY 
HIS INGENUITY HAS TO DRIVE THE SOVIET PROGRAMME THROUGH EVERY DECISION 
IT MIGHT BE HARD AND FIRM 
BUT IT COULD BE JUST SO SOFT AND FINE THAT WE SINK IN A POOL OF DUST 
SO YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHETHER THE MOON IS HARD OR SOFT 
WHO CAN TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT DECISION 
THE SURFACE OF THE MOON IS HARD 
SIGNED S. P. KOROLEV 
TAKE THAT GET OUT 
KOROLEV HAS FOUND A REPLACEMENT FOR GLUSHKO 
HIS NEW ROCKET ENGINE DESIGNER WILL BE NIKOLAI KUZNETSOV 
HOW MANY ENGINES ARE YOU PROPOSING FOR THE FIRST STAGE 
THE FIRST STAGE 
TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR WE'LL NEED TWENTY FOUR TO DELIVER ENOUGH THRUST 
NIKOLAI THE AMERICAN SATURN HAS FIVE MM HMM 
HOW ARE WE GOING TO CONTROL TWENTY FOUR ENGINES WE'LL FIND A WAY 
IT'S A BRILLIANT DESIGN WHICH I AM PLEASED TO SAY WILL MAKE GLUSHKO SPIT 
OH HOW ARE WE GOING TO TEST A STAGE OF TWENTY FOUR ENGINES 
WHEN WE LAUNCH 
VASILY THERE'S NO MONEY 
AND BESIDES IT WOULD TAKE THREE YEARS TO BUILD A TEST STAND LARGE ENOUGH 
ALL HERE GOOD THERE IS SOMETHING I MUST SHOW YOU 
I CAN GIVE YOU TWENTY FIVE MINUTES 
WHILE HIS LUNAR ROCKET IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION 
KOROLEV INVITES THE COSMONAUTS TO SEE A MOCK UP OF THE CAPSULE THAT WILL TAKE THEM TO THE MOON 
IT'S THE FULFILMENT OF A DREAM FOR WHICH HE'S FOUGHT FOR TEN YEARS 
THE SOYUZ 
IT WEIGHS SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED KILOS 
AND CAN CARRY THREE COSMONAUTS 
LEONOV GAGARIN AND KOMAROV ARE HIS TOP CANDIDATES 
THE SHIP HAS SOLAR PANELS FOR EXTRA POWER BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE IS ITS MANOEUVRABILITY 
UNLIKE OUR OLD VOSTOK IT CAN BE PILOTED IN SPACE 
IT CAN DOCK WITH OTHER SHIPS 
SO IT COULD LINK AND DETACH TO ANOTHER CRAFT WHICH DESCENDS TO THE MOON 
VLADIMIR TAKE A LOOK 
YOU MIGHT BE THE FIRST TO FLY HER 
A LOT MORE SPACE THAN THE VOSTOK TWICE THE SIZE 
WELL 
THERE WAS SOME DISPUTE ABOUT THAT 
A YOUNG DESIGNER WANTED TO MAKE IT SO SMALL 
I DREW A CHALK CIRCLE AROUND HIM THE SIZE HE PROPOSED AND MADE HIM STAND IN IT WE CONTINUED OUR DEBATE 
HE SOON AGREED TO MAKE THE CAPSULE BIGGER 
SERGEI PAVLOVICH ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
I'M FINE DON'T FUSS 
DON'T FUSS 
NOW LOOK 
YURI I HAVE TO GO 
AFTER LEAVING THE COSMONAUTS KOROLEV COLLAPSES WITH SEVERE HEART PAINS 
DOCTORS ORDER HIM TO TAKE REST 
HIS DEPUTY OF TWENTY YEARS VASILY MISHIN TAKES OVER WHILE HE'S AWAY 
YES VASILY YOU SPOKE TO THE MINISTER YES 
I MET HIM 
HE SAYS NO FURTHER FUNDS CAN BE RELEASED UNTIL WE SUBMIT A REPORT 
WELL OF COURSE HE'D SAY THAT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT 
SERGEI 
I CAN'T TAKE THIS 
THIS JOB IS NOT FOR ME 
I'M SORRY 
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK TO STAND DOWN 
PLEASE PLEASE VASILY CALM DOWN 
YOU CAN HANDLE IT 
JUST TELL THEM TO CONTINUE THE ENGINE TESTS 
I'LL DEAL WITH THIS WHEN I GET BACK 
TO ADD TO THE STRAIN 
NASA HAS DEVELOPED A NEW SPACECRAFT CALLED GEMINI 
AND IS LAUNCHING MANNED MISSIONS ALMOST EVERY TWO MONTHS 
THEY CARRY OUT SPACE WALKS TEST MANOEUVRES FOR SPACE DOCKING 
AND SET A TWO WEEK ENDURANCE RECORD IN ORBIT 
AN OBVIOUS PRELUDE TO THEIR APOLLO MOON MISSIONS 
SERGEI YOU OUGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS 
KOROLEV HAS NOTHING READY TO MATCH THIS 
THEY ARE LEAVING US BEHIND 
CRASHED TIME 
SEA OF STORMS M. M. HMM 
A SMALL UNMANNED SOVIET PROBE SENT TO INVESTIGATE THE MOON'S SURFACE CRASHES 
TO MARK HIS FIFTY NINTH BIRTHDAY 
KOROLEV INVITES MISHIN GAGARIN AND LEONOV TO CELEBRATE 
WE HAVE GREAT TIMES AHEAD 
WITH MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND HARD WORK WE WILL SUCCEED IN EVERY TASK 
AND HERE AMONG US ARE TWO YOUNG MEN 
WHO TO OUR GREAT JOY 
COMPLETED THEIR MISSIONS BRILLIANTLY 
I REMEMBER MY INTERROGATION 
YEAH 
HE SMASHED THE WATER JUG OVER MY HEAD 
ALL YOU SCIENTISTS ARE SO WEAK A WATER JUG WILL MAKE YOU FAINT 
A WEEK LATER I WAS TRIED 
THE PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR SAID TO ME ALL YOU BASTARDS SAY YOU'RE NOT GUILTY GIVE HIM TEN YEARS 
THE TRIAL LASTED LESS THAN A MINUTE 
I WAS SENT TO SIBERIA 
BUT I SURVIVED 
YOU SEE 
MY LIFE 
MY CAREER 
WAS MEANT TO BE 
AND NOW ALL I NEED IS TEN 
FIVE FIVE MORE YEARS TO COMPLETE MY MISSION 
FOUR DAYS LATER KOROLEV IS TAKEN IN FOR EXPLORATORY SURGERY 
AND A TUMOUR IS DISCOVERED 
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT 
I'M SORRY 
HE IS GONE 
WHILE UNDER ANAESTHETIC 
KOROLEV'S WEAK HEART FAILS 
THE DOMINANT CONTRIBUTION TO THRUST 
IS FROM REACTIVE THRUST 
WHERE M. IS THE TOTAL PROPELLANT MASS FLOW RATE 
NEWS OF KOROLEV'S DEATH CATCHES EVERYONE OFF GUARD 
VE 
IS THE EXHAUST SPEED OF THE JET LEAVING THE NOZZLE 
HIS DEPUTY VASILY MISHIN 
SUDDENLY FINDS HIMSELF IN CHARGE OF THE ENTIRE SOVIET SPACE PROGRAMME 
AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF ANONYMITY THE SOVIET PREMIER LEONID BREZHNEV 
DECIDES TO REVEAL THE GENIUS BEHIND THE SOVIET SPACE PROGRAMME 
THE FIRST TIME TOO THAT KOROLEV'S OWN MOTHER 
LEARNS THE TRUE IMPORTANCE OF HER SON'S ACHIEVEMENTS 
HIS NAME REVEALED TO THE WORLD THE MAN WHO HAD ONCE BEEN SENT TO THE GULAG 
NOW HAS A FULL STATE FUNERAL IN RED SQUARE 
EVEN HIS ASHES ARE PRESERVED IN THE KREMLIN WALL 
WERNHER VON BRAUN AT LAST DISCOVERS THE IDENTITY OF HIS GREATEST RIVAL 
I NEVER KNEW ALL THIS WAS JUST ONE MAN 
HOW WILL THEY DO WITHOUT HIM 
AT THE CAPE VON BRAUN IS SOARING AHEAD 
INSIDE THE LARGEST BUILDING EVER CONSTRUCTED 
HIS GIANT LUNAR ROCKET THE SATURN V. IS BEING ASSEMBLED 
NASA IS ALMOST READY FOR THE START OF THE APOLLO MISSIONS 
ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH DAY OF JANUARY NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN 
ASTRONAUTS GUS GRISSOM ED WHITE AND ROGER CHAFFEE 
ARE SEALED INSIDE THE NEW APOLLO CAPSULE FOR A FINAL RUN THROUGH ON THE GROUND 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT THROWS THE MOON PROGRAMME INTO CRISIS 
CAPCOM I DO NOT READ YOU PLEASE REPEAT 
APOLLO ONE THIS IS CAPCOM 
DO YOU COPY NOW APOLLO ONE THIS IS CAPCOM 
INTERFERENCE APOLLO ONE THIS IS CAPCOM 
GOD DAMN IF I CAN'T TALK TO YOU FROM FIVE MILES AWAY HOW AM I GONNA CONTACT YOU FROM THE MOON 
A SPARK SUDDENLY TURNS THE CAPSULE INTO AN INFERNO 
THE DEATH OF THE THREE ASTRONAUTS STUNS AMERICA 
THE SPARK IGNITED THE CAPSULE'S PURE OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE 
NASA HAS TO GO BACK AND PAINSTAKINGLY REWORK THEIR APOLLO CAPSULE FROM SCRATCH 
HALF NOW HALF WHEN YOU RETURN THANK YOU COMRADES 
OH I'M TOO LATE JUST THREE MONTHS LATER THE SOVIETS ARE READY 
TO TEST THEIR EQUIVALENT OF THE APOLLO CAPSULE THE SOYUZ 
IN AN AMBITIOUS MISSION VLADIMIR KOMAROV WILL DOCK THE SOYUZ WITH A SECOND SPACECRAFT 
NA ZDOROVYE NA ZDOROVYE 
EXCUSE ME 
UNMANNED FLIGHTS OF THE SPACECRAFT HOWEVER HAVE PROVED PROBLEMATIC 
VASILY PAVLOVICH PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THIS CRAFT IS NOT FIT FOR SERVICE 
IT'S FINE 
THREE FAILED FLIGHT TESTS THAT DOESN'T SOUND FINE KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN 
YOU KNOW THAT ALL THESE FAULTS COULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED 
IF THE SPACECRAFT WAS MANNED 
YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE SOYUZ HOME NO PROBLEM 
VOLODYA THE SOYUZ IS OUR FINEST SPACECRAFT 
AND YOU ARE OUR FINEST COSMONAUT 
NA ZDOROVYE 
ONCE IN ORBIT KOMAROV IS IN TROUBLE 
WITH A SOLAR PANEL JAMMED SHUT THE CRAFT IS STARVED OF POWER 
THE PANEL'S NOT MOVING NONE OF THE INSTRUMENTS WORK 
WE SHOULD ATTEMPT AN IMMEDIATE RE ENTRY 
WE KEEP THE POWER DEMANDS DOWN TO A MINIMUM 
THEN WHEN THE SECOND SOYUZ COMES ALONGSIDE THE OTHERS CAN TRY TO PULL THE PANEL OFF 
A SPACE WALK THAT'S AN UNTRIED PROCEDURE 
IT WILL BE GOOD TRYING IT 
ONLY ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL SYSTEMS TO BE LEFT ON 
ALL OTHERS TO BE SWITCHED OFF 
BY THE THIRTEENTH ORBIT THE AUTOMATIC RE ENTRY SYSTEMS ALSO FAIL 
KOMAROV'S CHANCES OF SURVIVAL ARE SLIM 
HIS ONLY HOPE TO PILOT THE STRICKEN CRAFT HOME HIMSELF 
CONVINCED IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK 
KOMAROV'S WIFE IS CALLED IN TO SAY GOODBYE 
AGAINST ALL THE ODDS KOMAROV BRILLIANTLY GUIDED THE TUMBLING SOYUZ 
THROUGH THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE 
BUT BOTH HIS MAIN AND BACK UP PARACHUTE FAILED 
HE DIED AS HE CRASHED INTO THE STEPPE WITH THE FORCE OF A METEORITE 
WHY ARE WE HAVING THESE FAILURES 
I'LL TELL YOU WHY POOR WORK BAD PRACTICES 
A LAZY APPROACH 
EVERYBODY HAS AN EXCUSE 
THIS DOESN'T FUNCTION 
I CAN'T GET THIS MADE 
EXCUSES EXCUSES THAT COVER UP SHODDY USELESS WORK 
MISHIN INCREASINGLY RELIES ON ALCOHOL TO DEAL WITH THE PRESSURE 
IT HAS BEEN MY DUTY TO INFORM 
THE STATE COMMISSION INFORM THEM THAT THIS THIRD FAILURE 
MEANS IT IS NOW NOT POSSIBLE TO CELEBRATE THE GLORIOUS FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION WITH A MANNED FLIGHT 
THE COSMONAUTS COMPLAIN ABOUT MISHIN TO THE SOVIET'S LEADERSHIP 
CITING HIS FAILINGS AS IMPATIENCE 
RUDENESS AND POOR KNOWLEDGE 
BUT NOTHING IS DONE 
TWO MONTHS LATER GAGARIN HIMSELF DIES KILLED IN A FLYING ACCIDENT 
GAGARIN'S DEATH SO SOON AFTER KOROLEV'S 
IS A FURTHER BLOW TO THE MORALE OF THE SOVIET SPACE PROGRAMME 
WHICH NOW FALTERS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE 
IN AMERICA VON BRAUN IS READY FOR A TEST FLIGHT OF HIS SATURN V. ROCKET 
AN UNMANNED DRESS REHEARSAL FOR THE REAL THING 
STANDING THIRTY SIX STORIES HIGH IT WEIGHS MORE THAN A BATTLE CRUISER 
THE GREATEST WEIGHT EVER LIFTED OFF THE GROUND 
IT TAKES FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY STAFF TO CONTROL THE COUNTDOWN 
VON BRAUN'S SATURN V. IS TO CARRY THE UNMANNED APOLLO CAPSULE INTO ORBIT 
FOR SAFETY THE PRESS ARE HELD BEHIND A THREE AND A HALF MILE EXCLUSION ZONE 
FOR VON BRAUN EVERYTHING HINGES ON THE RELIABILITY OF HIS ENGINES 
TEN NINE IGNITION SEQUENCE STARTS 
SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE 
YES 
OH LOOK AT THAT 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A NUCLEAR BOMB BLAST 
THE SATURN V. IS THE LOUDEST MAN MADE OBJECT EVER BUILT 
IT REGISTERS ON EARTHQUAKE CENSORS ACROSS AMERICA 
FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE SECONDS THE FLIGHT IS FLAWLESS 
FLIGHT BOOSTER 
GO WE'RE LOSING THRUST ROGER THAT 
WE HAVE A PROBLEM 
WE HAVE POGO PLUS MINUS TEN G.S' 
POGO POWERFUL VIBRATIONS DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE ROCKET 
IF THEY BECOME VIOLENT ENOUGH THEY'LL CAUSE THE ROCKET TO BREAK UP 
COMBUSTION INSTABILITY FREQUENCY FIVE TO SIX CYCLES PER SECOND 
WAIT WAIT WAIT IT'S OVER STAGE ONE SEPARATED 
ENGINE OUT WHICH ENGINE TWO 
ANOTHER ENGINE OUT FLIGHT BOOSTER 
OH MY GOD GO 
WE'VE GOT ENGINES TWO AND THREE OUT SHE'S FALLING 
BOOSTER IT'S YOUR ACTION ARE YOU GO FOR ABORT 
ARE YOU GO FOR ABORT 
WAIT WAIT 
WE STILL HAVE GOOD CONTROL AT THIS TIME OH 
ROGER THAT 
ALTHOUGH THE SATURN LIMPS INTO ORBIT 
VON BRAUN CANNOT RISK A MANNED FLIGHT UNTIL THE ENGINE PROBLEMS ARE FIXED 
THE SOVIETS ALSO HAVE ENGINE PROBLEMS 
THEIR NEW DESIGNER NIKOLAI KUZNETSOV HAS BEEN FORCED TO ADD EXTRA ENGINES 
TO PROVIDE MORE THRUST 
THE FIRST STAGE NOW HAS THIRTY 
BUT HE FACES CRITICISM FROM KOROLEV'S OLD ADVERSARY VALENTIN GLUSHKO 
DURING THE STATIC FIRING OF THE N. K. FIFTEEN 
THERE WAS A PARTIAL BLOWOUT OF THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER 
COMRADES WE NEED NOT GO ANY FURTHER 
YOU CAN SEE THAT THESE ENGINES 
ARE NOT FIT FOR THE N. ONE NOR FOR ANY OTHER ROCKET FOR THAT MATTER 
WAIT WAIT THESE FAULTS WERE NOT IN THE DESIGN BUT SIMPLE MANUFACTURING ERRORS 
AT THIS STAGE I WISH TO PROPOSE REDESIGNING THE N. ONE 
I HAVE PLANS THAT WOULD UTILISE OUR PROVEN R. D. TWO THIRTY FIVE ENGINE 
IGNORING GLUSHKO'S OPPOSITION KOROLEV'S DREAM ROCKET THE N. ONE 
MAKES A FLEETING APPEARANCE ON THE PAD 
BUT ENGINEERS FIND CRACKS IN ITS OUTER CASING 
WERNHER 
WERNHER 
WE'VE HAD REPORTS REPORTS FROM THE C. I. A. 
THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE GETTING CLOSE TO A MANNED CIRCUMLUNAR FLIGHT 
MAYBE BY THE END OF THE YEAR 
WITH WHAT 
THESE ARE CLASSIFIED SATELLITE SHOTS 
OF THEIR LAUNCH PAD AT TYURATAM 
THEY SHOW A SATURN SIZE ROCKET 
APOLLO EIGHT SHOULD TAKE A CREW AROUND THE MOON 
THAT'S INSANE WE WON'T HAVE TEST FLOWN A SATURN 
SINCE WE HAD THE ENGINE FAILURE AND POGO YES BUT WE CAN'T RISK THEM DOING IT FIRST 
WHOEVER SENDS MEN AROUND THE MOON WILL HAVE AS GOOD AS WON THE RACE 
IT WILL BE A MASSIVE PROPAGANDA VICTORY IT'S SOME PROPOSITION TO COMMIT HUMAN LIFE 
WELL IF WE'D TAKEN A LITTLE MORE RISK BEFORE WE WOULD'VE GOT AN AMERICAN UP THERE FIRST 
O. K. 
WE GO 
SAY THAT YOU'LL BE TRUE AND NEVER LEAVE ME BLUE SUZIE Q. 
SAY THAT YOU'LL MINE 
SAY THAT YOU'LL BE MINE CAN I GET A COFFEE PLEASE 
A LARGE ONE 
SO PAUL YOU HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT THE CAUSE OF THE ENGINE FAILURES 
YES SIR I THINK WE HAVE 
AS YOU KNOW THE HYDROGEN FUEL LINES ARE DESIGNED TO FLEX WITH THE VIBRATION OF THE ENGINE 
WELL WE DIDN'T REALISE THAT THE VIBRATION WAS BEING FURTHER DAMPENED BY THE LIQUID HYDROGEN 
FREEZING MOISTURE IN THE AIR AROUND THE PIPES AND IN SPACE 
WITHOUT ANY MOIST AIR YOU LOST THIS EFFECT YEAH WITHOUT THE EXTRA LAYER OF PROTECTION 
THEY VIBRATE LIKE CRAZY 
THAT IS UNTIL THEY BROKE APART AND THE FUEL SPILLED OUT 
THANKS 
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS NOW THAT WE KNOW THE CAUSE IT'S NO PROBLEM TO REDESIGN THE PIPES 
GOOD SO LET'S GET RIGHT ON IT 
THE RUSSIANS BEAT US INTO SPACE 
I'M NOT GONNA SEE THEM BEAT US ONTO THE MOON 
UNKNOWN TO VON BRAUN 
WITHOUT SERGEI KOROLEV THE SOVIETS ARE FLOUNDERING 
WHY WASN'T I TOLD 
WHY WASN'T I TOLD WHAT'S WRONG 
WE LOST PRESSURE 
THE PROXY TEMPERATURE IS LOW MINUS FIVE 
VASILY PAVLOVICH 
COME ON 
LET'S GO I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE 
WITH MISHIN UNABLE TO COPE THE COSMONAUTS COME UP WITH A HIGH RISK PLAN 
WE COSMONAUTS OF THE SOVIET UNION RESPECTFULLY ASK THE POLITBURO 
TO CONSIDER FOR THE NEXT CIRCUMLUNAR MISSION TO BE MANNED 
WE ARE READY TO TAKE THE RISK WHATEVER IT MAY BRING 
TO SERVE THE MOTHERLAND THIS IS OUR DUTY 
THEY APPEALED TO THE POLITBURO FOR A MANNED FLIGHT AROUND THE MOON ON SEVENTH DECEMBER 
IF SUCCESSFUL THEY WILL BEAT THE AMERICANS 
BOB IT'S WERNHER LI 
FINE LISTEN THE FIXES WILL BE COMPLETE 
AND THE FLIGHT SAFETY CERTIFICATION FOR EIGHTEENTH DECEMBER 
YEAH YEAH THAT'S THE POGOS AND THE J. TWO FUEL LINES 
YES THAT'S THREE DAYS BEFORE LAUNCH 
I AGREE IT'S TIGHT IT'S VERY TIGHT 
I HOPE SO TOO BOB I HOPE SO TOO 
AT THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER THE COSMONAUTS' REQUEST TO FLY AROUND THE MOON IS DENIED 
GOOD LUCK AMERICANS 
GOOD LUCK 
APOLLO EIGHT HAS CLEARED THE TOWER 
THE AMERICANS SEND THREE ASTRONAUTS TO FLY AROUND THE MOON FOR THE FIRST TIME 
T. PLUS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE SECONDS FIRST STAGE HAS SEPARATED 
THE SATURN HASN'T FLOWN SINCE THE ENGINE AND POGO PROBLEMS 
APOLLO YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD YOUR TRAJECTORY AND GUIDANCE ARE GO 
ENGINES ARE FINE 
ONCE THE ROCKET STAGES DROP AWAY 
A CRITICAL STEP IS T. L. I. TRANS LUNAR INJECTION THE FINAL ENGINE BURN 
TO SET THEM ON A COURSE FOR THE MOON 
APOLLO EIGHT YOU'RE GO FOR T. L. I. 
ROGER UNDERSTAND WE ARE GO FOR T. L. I. 
COMMANDER FRANK BORMAN JIM LOVELL AND BILL ANDERS 
HAVE TO FLY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND MILES OUT INTO SPACE 
AND NAVIGATE FOR THE FIRST TIME INTO THE MOON'S ORBIT 
ON CHRISTMAS EVE THE CREW OF APOLLO EIGHT 
BECOME THE FIRST HUMAN BEINGS TO LOOK DOWN ON THE LUNAR SURFACE 
AS THEY DISAPPEAR BEHIND THE MOON ALL RADIO CONTACT IS LOST 
IF THEY FAIL TO LOCK INTO THE MOON'S ORBIT 
THEY WILL FLY ON FOREVER LOST IN SPACE 
APOLLO EIGHT COME IN 
APOLLO EIGHT THIS IS HOUSTON 
APOLLO EIGHT APOLLO EIGHT THIS IS HOUSTON 
WELCOME TO THE MOON HOUSTON 
SUDDENLY AS THEY EMERGE FROM THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON 
A SIGHT UNSEEN BY HUMAN EYE 
THE RISING EARTH SHINING OVER THE MOON'S BLEAK SURFACE 
FROM THE CREW OF APOLLO EIGHT WE CLOSE WITH GOOD NIGHT GOOD LUCK 
A MERRY CHRISTMAS AND GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU ALL OF YOU ON THE GOOD EARTH 
THE CREW OF APOLLO EIGHT CAME WITHIN SEVENTY MILES OF THE MOON'S SURFACE 
THE NEXT STEP IS TO ACTUALLY LAND A MAN ON THE MOON 
BUT JUST SEVENTEEN DAYS BEFORE THE AMERICAN MOON MISSION 
MISHIN IS READY FOR AN UNMANNED LAUNCH OF HIS LUNAR ROCKET 
NOW WE GET TO SEE WHO WAS RIGHT 
TO SUCCEED KUZNETSOV'S THIRTY ENGINES MUST ALL FIRE TOGETHER 
DESYAT DEVYAT VOSEM SEM 
SHEST PYAT CHETYRE TRI DVA ODIN 
TORN APART WITH ALMOST THE FORCE OF A NUCLEAR BOMB 
IT IS THE MOST POWERFUL EXPLOSION IN THE HISTORY OF ROCKETRY 
CAUSED BY A SINGLE BOLT SUCKED INTO A FUEL PUMP 
THE EXPLOSION SCATTERS PIECES OF DEBRIS OVER TEN KILOMETRES 
THE FAILURE IS A STATE SECRET FOR TWENTY YEARS 
THE DISASTER EFFECTIVELY ENDS THE CAREER OF VASILY MISHIN 
IN AMERICA ONE LAST DETAIL BEFORE THE MOON LANDING 
CHOOSING THE FLAG 
TO ENSURE NO ONE MANUFACTURER CAN PROFIT BY CLAIMING IT'S THEIR FLAG ON THE MOON 
A NASA SECRETARY MAKES A RANDOM SELECTION 
ON SIXTEENTH JULY 
COMMANDER NEIL ARMSTRONG EDWIN BUZZ ALDRIN AND MICHAEL COLLINS 
THE CREW OF APOLLO ELEVEN MAKE THEIR WAY OUT TO THE PAD 
ONE MILLION PEOPLE GATHER AT THE CAPE TO SEE THEM OFF 
ACROSS THE WORLD HALF A BILLION ARE WATCHING 
THE SATURN'S MAIN ENGINES HAVE TO FIRE FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SECONDS TO TAKE THE CREW SAFELY INTO ORBIT 
COME ON 
COME ON 
HOLD TOGETHER HOLD TOGETHER 
TWENTY FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE VON BRAUN 
BROUGHT HIS ROCKET TECHNOLOGY TO AMERICA 
NOW HE IS ABOUT TO REALISE HIS LONG HELD DREAM 
TO LAND A MAN ON THE MOON 
ROGER HOW DOES IT LOOK 
THE EAGLE HAS WINGS RODGE 
MICHAEL COLLINS ORBITS THE MOON IN THE COMMAND MODULE 
WE'RE GO SITTING TIGHT WE'RE GO AS NEIL ARMSTRONG AND BUZZ ALDRIN HEAD FOR THE LUNAR SURFACE 
EAGLE LOOKING GREAT

FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FEET AT FIFTEEN 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FEET DOWN AT FOUR 
ALTITUDE VELOCITY LIGHT 
BUT WHILE STRUGGLING TO FIND A LANDING SITE THE FUEL RUNS DANGEROUSLY LOW 
COMING DOWN NICELY TWO HUNDRED FEET FOUR AND A HALF DOWN FIVE AND A HALF DOWN 
ONE HUNDRED FEET THREE AND A HALF DOWN NINE FORWARD

YOU GOT A BUNCH OF GUYS ABOUT TO TURN BLUE WE'RE BREATHING AGAIN THANKS A LOT 
AS YOU GET CLOSE TO IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE A POWDER 
THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN 
ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND 
WHILE ARMSTRONG AND ALDRIN ARE ON THE MOON A SOVIET PROBE 
SENT IN A LAST DITCH EFFORT TO STEAL SOME GLORY OVERSHOOTS THEIR LANDING SITE 
IT CRASHES IN THE APPROPRIATELY NAMED SEA OF CRISES 
VON BRAUN WILL MASTERMIND ANOTHER FIVE SUCCESSFUL MANNED MISSIONS TO THE MOON 
HIS GREATER VISION OF A BASE ON THE MOON AND MANNED FLIGHTS TO OTHER PLANETS 
IS YET TO BE FULFILLED 
THE TARGETS CHANGE THE TERROR DOES NOT 
THE BLOODY HISTORY OF FORTY YEARS OF TERRORISM
