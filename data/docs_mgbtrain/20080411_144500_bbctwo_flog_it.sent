TODAY WE'RE AT THE HISTORIC CITY OF YORK'S MAGNIFICENT RACECOURSE 
BUT WE'RE HERE TO SPECULATE ON ANTIQUES WELCOME TO FLOG IT 
THERE'S BEEN HORSE RACING ON THIS SITE FOR NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS 
AND IT'S THE SPORT OF KINGS 
IT WAS HERE THAT THE NOTORIOUS OUTLAW DICK TURPIN SWUNG FROM THE GALLOWS POLE IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY NINE 
AS ALWAYS THE CONDITIONS HERE ARE SUPERB AND BOTH OUR EXPERTS ARE IN FINE FETTLE 
AND HERE THEY ARE IN THEIR SUNDAY BEST MARK STACEY AND MICHAEL BAGGOTT 
JUDY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IN THIS WONDERFUL VASE CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT IT YES 
I GOT IT FROM MY FATHER BUT HE GOT IT AS PART OF A WEDDING PRESENT FROM MY GREAT AUNT OH RIGHT 
WHERE DID SHE GET IT FROM I BELIEVE SHE BROUGHT IT BACK FROM CHINA OR WHEREVER ON A WORLD TRIP 
SHE PROBABLY VISITED JAPAN AS WELL YES I'M SURE SHE WENT TO BOTH IT'S A JAPANESE VASE 
IT'S A RATHER LOVELY ONE THE JAPANESE ARE EXQUISITE POTTERS AND SHE PROBABLY BOUGHT THIS 
BACK IN NINETEEN HUNDRED NINETEEN TEN AROUND ABOUT THAT SORT OF TIME 
WHEN IT WAS BRAND NEW 
BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE IT'S MODERN IT'S POOR QUALITY 
THE JAPANESE REALLY REACHED THE PEAK OF THE DECORATIVE ARTS IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY UP TO NINETEEN HUNDRED RIGHT 
THAT WAS ITS TECHNICAL BEST 
AND WHAT THE JAPANESE POTTER HERE HAS TRIED TO DO IS COPY A VERY IMPRESSIVE PIECE OF PORCELAIN 
FROM ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY RIGHT 
IN A PALETTE CALLED KOIMARI 
IT'S A RATHER SPLENDID POT BECAUSE IT'S GOT THIS WONDERFUL DRAGON SCALE DECORATION 
WITH THESE BUTTERFLIES AND THESE WONDERFUL GREEN RESERVES 
AND EACH ONE IS PATTERNED WITH THESE LITTLE CIRCULAR RESERVES 
EACH PAINTED DIFFERENTLY ARE THEY ALL DONE INDIVIDUALLY 
ALL DONE INDIVIDUALLY BY HAND WHICH IS BREATHTAKING 
BUT THERE IS ONE LITTLE BIT OF DAMAGE ON A PANEL HERE YES 
IT'S HAD A TOUCH OR A BANG THIS RED DOES FLAKE OFF 
HOWEVER I HAVE A FEELING YOU DON'T LIKE IT I HATE IT BECAUSE IT'S COVERED IN EMULSION 
I'M NOT GUILTY OF THAT IT WASN'T YOU THAT WAS IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE 
HE WASN'T THAT FOND OF IT EITHER 
I THINK HE WAS BUT IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF A WEDDING PRESENT RATHER THAN THE ACTUAL VASE 
THANKFULLY THIS WILL COME OFF I HAVEN'T TRIED TO 
THERE ARE LITTLE SPECKS THAT WOULD PING OFF BUT WE'LL LEAVE THAT BE 
IT IS SIGNED UNDERNEATH 
AND APART FROM TELLING YOU THAT'S MOUNT FUJI I WAS GOING TO SAY CAN YOU READ IT I CAN'T 
IT'S THE ARTIST'S SIGNATURE IT'S LOVELY ANY IDEAS WHAT IT'S WORTH 
NONE WHATSOEVER 
AT AUCTION IT SHOULD EASILY MAKE ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED 
RIGHT AND IF WE POP IT INTO THE SALE WITH ONE HUNDRED RESERVE ON IT 
WE'LL SEE WHERE IT GOES 
BUT WHY NOW HAVE YOU DECIDED TO PART WITH IT 
I DON'T LIKE IT AND I'VE THOUGHT IT'S EITHER WORTH SOMETHING OR IT'S NOT 
IF YOU HAD TOLD ME IT WAS WORTH NOTHING I'D HAVE GIVEN IT TO A CHARITY SHOP 
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT AND WAITED AT THE CHARITY SHOP DOOR 
I LOVE IT WE'LL POP IT INTO THE SALE YES HOPEFULLY IT'LL DO WELL 
HOPEFULLY TWO JAPANESE BUYERS WILL HELP IT MAKE ONE THOUSAND 
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT IN THANK YOU 
HELLO JOCK HELLO THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING COLLECTION OF GREAT WAR MEMORABILIA 
WE'LL GO INTO SOME OF THE PIECES IN A MOMENT BUT GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY 
OF THE MAN THIS BELONGED TO HE WAS A LOCAL MAN FROM YORK 
HE SERVED THROUGHOUT THE WAR IN THE FIELD ARTILLERY AND I DO BELIEVE HE WAS WOUNDED 
SO HE SERVED THROUGH THIS HIDEOUS FOUR YEAR BATTLE IN THE TRENCHES WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM 
HE SURVIVED THE WAR AND WENT TO WORK AT THE RAILWAY 
UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS KILLED IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE 
TWO YEARS AFTER AFTER THE WAR YES AND HOW HAVE YOU BROUGHT US THIS 
I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THEM OFF A RELATION OF THIS MAN 
I BELIEVE HE WAS HIS GREAT GRANDFATHER OR SOMETHING 
I COLLECT MILITARIA SO I BOUGHT IT SO HE WAS IN THE ROYAL FIELD ARTILLERY 
WE CAN SEE PART OF THE COLLECTION PIP SQUEAK AND WILFRED 
WHICH IS THE GENERAL NICKNAME FOR THE THREE GENERAL WAR MEDALS 
AND THEN WE'VE GOT A WHOLE SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS AND POSTCARDS VALENTINES 
RATION BOOKS ET CETERA AND A LITTLE NOVELTY GROUP OF BUTTONS 
ONE THING I FIND WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING IS THIS LITTLE LETTER WHICH WAS WRITTEN TO HIM 
IT SAYS DEAR TOMMY I ONCE AGAIN HAVE MUCH PLEASURE IN SENDING ANOTHER PAIR OF SOCKS 
I HOPE YOU WILL SOON BE ONE OF THE HELPERS TO BRING THIS WAR TO AN END 
YOURS A SCHOOLGIRL MYRTLE BENNETT YES AND THEN SHE SIGNED IT IN LITTLE KISSES WITH LUCK 
YES VERY NICE LOVELY IT SHOWS THE WHOLE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY WAS BEHIND THEM 
IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT OF COURSE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH A LOT OF SENTIMENT LIKE THIS 
TO PUT A VALUE ON IT BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FINANCIALLY 
IF I WAS PUTTING THIS IN AS A LITTLE GROUP 
ALL THAT SENTIMENT MUST HELP A COLLECTOR LOOK AT THE CHARACTER 
I WOULD PROBABLY SUGGEST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE THINKING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT PRICE YES 
SHALL WE HOPE THEY GO TO A COLLECTOR WHO KEEPS IT ALL TOGETHER 
I'D HOPE SOMEONE IN THE ARTILLERY WOULD BUY IT YOU COLLECT MILITARIA 
YES SCOTTISH IF I CAN FIND IT BEING A SCOTSMAN OF COURSE 
AND WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO SELL IT NOW 
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE I'VE GOT MY EYE ON WHAT'S THAT A GERMAN HELMET 
LIKE THIS MINIATURE ONE HERE LIKE THAT ONE WITH THE BIG SPIKE ON THE TOP 
YES IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO MEET YOU THANK YOU FOR COMING IN 
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE AUCTION AND LET'S HOPE WE CAN GET THOSE BUYERS IN THANK YOU 
ROBERT AND JULIA WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE A CHART THE ANATOMICAL MODEL OF THE HUMAN BODY 
WELL I'M A PHARMACIST AND A VERY NICE LADY CUSTOMER OF MINE A FEW YEARS AGO CAME IN 
AND DONATED THIS TO ME THOUGHT YOU COULD USE IT 
HAS IT COME IN USEFUL 
IT'S A LITTLE DATED I THINK 
IT LOOKS JUDGING BY THE WAY THE ARTIST HAS DRAWN THE CHAP'S HAIRSTYLE AND MOUSTACHE 
LIKE NINETEEN TEN NINETEEN FIFTEEN SOMEWHERE IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO 
THAT MOUSTACHE IS A GIVEAWAY LET'S OPEN IT UP 
IT OPENS UP TO REVEAL THE INTERNAL ORGANS 
WE'VE GOT LOTS OF NUMBERS HERE FOR INSTANCE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED ONE 
I GUESS THERE'S AN INDEX 
IF WE LOOK UP HERE THERE IS INDEED AN INDEX 
WE CAN GO TO NUMBER ONE HUNDRED ONE WHY DID I PICK THAT 
THE URINARY BLADDER 
WELL I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
IT'S IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND I'M PLEASED THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AFTER IT I DO WANT TO HANG ON TO IT 
I THINK VALUE WISE NOT A GREAT DEAL 
BUT SOMEWHERE AROUND SIXTY TO EIGHTY THAT'S LOVELY YEAH THANK YOU 
KEITH I'M ALWAYS FASCINATED BY LITTLE BOXES LITTLE INSTRUMENT MAKER'S BOXES 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK INSIDE HERE 
THAT LOOKS PROMISING 
I HOPE SOMETHING POPS OUT AT ME WILL IT I KNOW NOTHING 
IT'S SOME SCALES BUT THERE WE GO THEY'RE FAMILIAR TO A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WE'VE HAD THEM ON FLOG IT BEFORE THEY'RE GUINEA SCALES 
YOU GET GUINEA SCALES AND SOVEREIGN SCALES 
THEY'RE BECAUSE EVERYONE IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WAS A LITTLE BIT DODGY 
AND THEY WOULD HAVE GOLD GUINEAS THAT'S THE FACE VALUE TWENTY ONE SHILLINGS 
BUT IF YOU WERE CLEVER OR DEVIOUS YOU WOULD TAKE YOUR GUINEA AND FILE AND HAVE A LITTLE PILE OF GOLD 
IF YOU DID THAT FOR LONG ENOUGH YOU HAD A BIG PILE OF GOLD 
IT WAS DEVALUING THE COINAGE 
YOU ALSO GET FAKE GUINEAS THAT ARE BRASS OR COPPER AND THEY'VE BEEN GILDED 
TO PREVENT THIS A TRADER HAD THIS LITTLE DEVIL YOU PUT THE GUINEA ON THAT SIDE 
YOU MOVE THE SLIDE ALONG HERE FOR A GUINEA OR A HALF GUINEA 
AND IF IT WERE A BAD UN IT DIDN'T TILT IT AND YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT 
IT'S AN INTERESTING PIECE OF SOCIAL HISTORY WHERE DID YOU GET IT I FOUND IT WHEN MY FATHER DIED 
IT WAS LEFT IN HIS EFFECTS AND HAS BEEN CLUTTERING A DRAWER 
WHAT'S LOVELY IS WE'VE GOT A MAKER'S LABEL 
WILKINSON'S ORMSKIRK LANCASHIRE 
WE'VE ALSO GOT IF I FOLD IT DOWN 
THIS IS THE TRICKY BIT 
THERE WE GO BACK IN THE BOX 
WE'VE GOT PROBABLY NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNERS BUT A NAME ON THERE HENRY BOWLAND SOMETHING 
YES I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT IT IS AT ALL 
MY FATHER WORKED IN AUSTRALIA FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND I ASSUMED IT CAME FROM THERE 
BUT YOU'VE TOLD ME IT'S DEFINITELY FROM THE U. K. LANCASHIRE NOT THAT FAR AWAY 
AND SOVEREIGNS CAME IN AS A COIN IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY 
SO IT'S WELL BEFORE THAT IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIVE 
IT'S QUITE COLLECTABLE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER ABOUT ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S WORTH 
ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA ABSOLUTELY IT'S NOT A FORTUNE FOR WHAT IT IS 
BUT WE COULD PUT IT INTO AUCTION AT SAY FIFTY TO SEVENTY THAT'SFINE 
FORTY FIVE RESERVE AND SEE WHICH LEVEL IT FINDS IT'S THE NICEST ONE I'VE SEEN 
SO I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF IT DID ONE HUNDRED ON THE DAY 
IF YOU'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT I'M QUITE WILLING TO YEAH 
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY GUINEAS TO WEIGH AT HOME UNFORTUNATELY NO 
THEY'D BE WORTH MORE THAN THE SCALES NOTHING OF VALUE IT'S BEEN DELIGHTFUL TO SEE IT 
OUR FIRST BATCH OF ANTIQUES HAVE TRAVELLED FROM AFAR 
SOMETHING FROM THE ORIENT SOME POIGNANT MEMORIES FROM WWI 
AND POCKET GUINEA SCALES WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN TO AUSTRALIA 
FOR OUR AUCTION TODAY WE'VE HEADED WEST TO ILKLEY 
HARTLEY'S AUCTION ROOM IS GOING TO BE JAM PACKED 
FULL OF POTENTIAL BIDDERS ALL LOOKING AT OUR ITEMS LET'S CATCH UP WITH THE ACTION 
OUR AUCTIONEER IS ANDREW HARTLEY IT'S HIS JOB TO SELL OUR LOTS 
LET'S HEAR WHAT HE'S GOT TO SAY ABOUT JOCK'S COLLECTION OF WORLD WAR ONE MEMORABILIA 
THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING LITTLE LOT YOU'VE HAD A LOOK AT IT 
BROUGHT IN BY A CHAP CALLED JOCK 
THIS WWI SOLDIER WAS A YORKSHIREMAN IT'S SOME MEMORABILIA HIS MEDALS HIS PHOTOGRAPHS 
HIS PAY BOOK SOME CAP BADGES 
HE SERVED THROUGHOUT THE WAR AND TWO YEARS LATER WAS KILLED WORKING ON A RAILWAY LINE 
MARK HAS PUT A VALUATION OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ON THE WHOLE COLLECTION 
WHAT BAD LUCK TO GO RIGHT THROUGH THE WAR AND THEN GET RUN OVER BY ONE OF HIS WAGONS SO SAD TRAGIC 
IT'S REALLY HARD TO PUT A PRICE ON WE GET THIS ALL THE TIME 
WE GET RANGES OF MEDALS WHICH ARE WORTH FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY 
BUT IT'S ALL THE OTHER BITS AND BOBS THAT'S THE VALUE 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO PUT A PRICE ON IT MY VIEW WAS TO TEMPER THE INITIAL ESTIMATE 
IN ORDER TO GET THE BLOKES IN THE MARKET THESE COLLECTORS 
THEY WILL HOPEFULLY GET IT UP A BIT 
WHAT HAVE YOU REDUCED IT TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
THAT'S NOT A VAST AMOUNT BUT IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS 
LET'S HOPE WORD HAS GOT AROUND FIRST UP IT'S JUDY'S JAPANESE JAR

A NEW GUITAR OR LESSONS WONDERFUL BEN THIS IS FOR YOU 
THAT'S OUR FIRST BATCH OF ITEMS UNDER THE HAMMER BUT THERE'S PLENTY MORE AUCTION ACTION LATER ON 
RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
I'M GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE MYSTERIOUS WORLD OF MORRIS DANCING 
FOR MOST OF US MORRIS DANCING USUALLY CONJURES UP IMAGES OF BEARDED MEN IN FLOWERY STRAW HATS 
WITH BELLS ON THEIR KNEES AND WAVING HANKIES IN THE AIR 
BUT HERE IN YORKSHIRE THEY DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY 
THE HANKIES HAVE GIVEN WAY TO STICKS AND THE MEN HAVE BEEN JOINED BY WOMEN WITH NO STRAW HATS 
KEEPING THE TRADITION OF MERRY ENGLAND ALIVE IS OTLEY'S WHARFEDALE WAYZGOOSE 
WHO HAVE DEVELOPED THEIR VERY OWN DISTINCTIVE STYLE 
JENNY THAT WAS FANTASTIC AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THIS IS TOTALLY UNLIKE THE MORRIS DANCING I KNOW I GREW UP IN CORNWALL 
IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU DO THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TRADITIONS 
PEOPLE THINK OF THE MEN WITH STRAW HATS AND HANKIES BUT THERE'S ALL SORTS OF TRADITIONS 
IN THE NORTHWEST THEY HAVE MORRIS DANCING THAT INVOLVES CLOGS 
THERE ARE SWORD DANCERS ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT THE ORIGINS ARE A BIT TRICKY 
WE KNOW IT STARTED IN THE LATE FIFTEENTH CENTURY AS COURT DANCING JESTERS THAT SORT OF THING 
IT WAS CALLED MOORISH EXOTIC THERE IS NO MORRIS IS THERE I BET HE'D BE A LOVELY CHAP 
IT TAKES THE MICKY OUT OF THE ARISTOCRACY IT'S A WORKING MAN'S DANCE 
THE HANKIES AND BELLS ARE MIMICKING THE FOPPERY OF THE ARISTOCRACY 
LOOK AT THE EARLY MORRIS DANCES IT'S ALL BOWING AND SCRAPING 
BUT THIS IS BORDER MORRIS DANCING WHERE DOES THIS ORIGINATE 
IT COMES FROM SHROPSHIRE AND THE WELSH BORDERS 
FROM AGRICULTURAL WORKERS WHO DIDN'T HAVE ANY WORK IN THE WINTER 
THEY'D BLACK THEIR FACE SO NOBODY KNEW IT WAS THEM AND THEY'D DANCE OUTSIDE THE PUBS 
HAVE A FEW BEERS AND ENJOY THEMSELVES 
WERE THEIR FACES ALWAYS BLACK ALWAYS PAINTED FACES NOT ALWAYS BLACK 
SOME ARE RED AND GREEN OR YELLOW BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE A DISGUISED FACE THAT ALWAYS DISTINGUISHES THIS 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DRESS CODE O. K. 
IT IS VERY COLOURFUL VERY THEATRICAL I LOVE THE TUNICS BUT THE HATS ESPECIALLY 
DO YOU MAKE THEM ALL WE DO IT'S LIKE THE GREEN MAN OR SOMETHING THERE ARE PAGAN THINGS GOING ON 
YEAH EVERYBODY'S HAT IS DIFFERENT IF YOU LOOK DOWN THE ROW OF HATS 
YOU WILL SEE A WHOLE RANGE THE RAM'S HORN MY PARTNER MADE THOSE 
I HAVE THE GREEN MAN BECAUSE IT'S MY PARTICULAR THING 
PEOPLE HAVE BREWING ITEMS ON STUART HAS STONEHENGE 
EVERYBODY DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FEATHER WHY 
IT'S A WAYZGOOSE AND SHOULD HAVE A GOOSE FEATHER 
AND THE NAME THE WAYZGOOSE WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM IT'S A PRINTER'S FESTIVAL 
OTLEY IS A PRINTING TOWN IT MADE THE WHARFEDALE PRINTING PRESS 
WAYZGOOSE IS A PRINTER'S FESTIVAL 
ONCE A YEAR THE MASTER PRINTER WOULD TAKE THE APPRENTICES OUT ON TWENTY FOURTH AUGUST FOR A PICNIC 
AND THERE WOULD BE A GOOSE FEAST AS WE'VE TRAVELLED ROUND THE COUNTRY IT'S BEEN LOVELY 
PEOPLE COME UP AND SAY I BET YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR NAME MEANS 
WE'VE MET PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN ON WAYZGOOSE OLD GENTLEMEN 
AND THEY'RE REALLY QUITE THRILLED TO THINK THE NAME IS STILL USED 
WHAT ABOUT THE STICKS AND THE INSTRUMENTS THE STICKS ARE SIMPLE 
THEY'RE A CHEAP MATERIAL TO DANCE WITH THE MELODEON IS A VERY TRADITIONAL MORRIS INSTRUMENT 
AND A LOT OF US USE A LOT OF DRUMS BUT IT'S A LOT LOUDER THAN THE TRADITIONAL ONE IT IS 
WE DO DO TRADITIONAL DANCES BUT THE ONE YOU SAW JUST NOW IS A RECENTLY COMPOSED DANCE 
THAT WE'VE ADAPTED TO OUR OWN WAY 
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY OUT WITH ONE MORE SONG AND I MAY BANG THE DRUMS 
OOH IF I'M ALLOWED YOU'RE ALLOWED 
BACK AT YORK RACECOURSE OUR EXPERTS ARE ON FORM AND MARK THINKS HE'S PICKED A WINNER 
HELLO IAN HELLO MARK WONDERFUL PIECE OF DOULTON A NICE VICTORIAN OIL LAMP 
ARE YOU A COLLECTOR OF DOULTON I'M AFRAID I AM AVID 
HOW MANY PIECES TOO MANY TO MENTION 
WHAT STARTED YOUR LOVE FOR IT 
WELL BEFORE I GOT THIS IT WAS A SPITTOON 
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING UNUSUAL SO I WENT FROM THERE 
AND I'M AFRAID IT WON'T GO AWAY 
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A BUG ONCE YOU START COLLECTING 
THIS WAS SOMETHING YOU PURCHASED NO THIS CAME FROM MY MOTHER AND FATHER 
BACK IN THE FIFTIES THEY GOT IT PASSED DOWN THE FAMILY TO THEM 
NO I THINK THEY WERE GIVEN IT BY SOMEBODY 
AND THEY GAVE IT TO ME ONCE YOU WERE COLLECTING 
THEY SAID YOU HAVE IT ANYBODY IN THE KNOW ABOUT DOULTON WOULD RECOGNISE THIS IMMEDIATELY 
WITH THIS LOVELY STONEWARE FINISH 
EQUALLY IF YOU'RE A DOULTON LOVER OR KNOW ABOUT DOULTON 
YOU'LL RECOGNISE THESE IMMEDIATELY AS BEING ONE OF THE BARLOW CLAN'S 
IN THIS CASE FLORENCE WHO SPECIALISED IN THESE RATHER NICE SLIPWARE BIRDS 
THIS COMES TOGETHER VERY NICELY 
IT'S AN OIL LAMP THIS BIT DOES COME OUT 
THAT'S WHERE YOU WOULD PUT THE LIQUID PARAFFIN OR WHATEVER TO KEEP YOUR LAMP GOING 
IT'S MOUNTED ON THIS NICE BRONZE STAND BUT IF WE MOVE IT ROUND HERE 
THERE'S THESE RATHER NICE PANELS OF WARBLERS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YES I THINK SO IN BULRUSHES 
IT'S QUITE QUIET ISN'T IT THEY'RE NOT SCREAMING AT YOU NO 
THE WHOLE THING SITS VERY COMFORTABLY TOGETHER I THINK WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT IT ALONG TODAY 
BASICALLY I WANTED A VALUATION BECAUSE NOBODY SEEMS TO LIKE IT IN MY FAMILY 
MY SON AND DAUGHTER DIDN'T REALLY KNOW I'D GOT IT ALTHOUGH IT'S ON SHOW 
AND MY WIFE DOESN'T LIKE IT NOT EVERYBODY WANTS TO ACCOMMODATE THESE LARGE PIECES 
YOU CAN'T REALLY USE THEM AS OIL LAMPS 
PEOPLE DON'T TEND TO DO THAT BUT WE HAVE A VERY GOOD DESIGNER 
VERY STRONG DECORATION 
AND I WOULD SAY IF YOU CAN ATTRACT TWO OR THREE GOOD COLLECTORS OF DOULTON LOOKING FOR THIS 
WE WOULD PROBABLY PUT AN ESTIMATE OF ONE THOUSAND TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ON IT RIGHT 
AND HOPE THAT TWO PEOPLE WOULD BATTLE IT UP TO THE TOP END YES WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YES I'D BE HAPPY BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT A RESERVE ON IT 
IT WOULDN'T WORRY ME IF I HAD TO TAKE IT HOME AGAIN NO QUITE 
WE SHOULD PUT A RESERVE AROUND ONE THOUSAND AND THEN HOPEFULLY IT MIGHT SET HEARTS 
FLUTTERING IN THE SALE ROOM 
LET'S HOPE SO WE'LL PUT IT ON THE INTERNET AND ILLUSTRATE IT IN THE CATALOGUE 
AND THEY'LL BE PLEASED TO MARKET IT AS ONE OF THEIR BETTER LOTS 
IF WE GOT YOU A GOOD PRICE WHAT WOULD YOU PUT THE MONEY TOWARDS 
MY WIFE SAID IF I SOLD IT AND GOT A GOOD PRICE I SHOULD GIVE IT TO THE GRANDCHILDREN 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE MORE DOULTON BECAUSE AS AN INVESTMENT THAT WILL DO THEM BETTER LATER ON 
THEY'D ONLY GO AND SPEND THE MONEY AND ALSO YOU GET THE PLEASURE OF ENJOYING IT TRUE 
HELENA DO YOU HAVE THIS MONSTER OF A THING UP AT HOME WE DON'T NO 
OH DEAR WHY IS THAT MUM AND DAD REDECORATED AND IT DIDN'T FIT IN WITH THE DECORATION 
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT THE MOUNTING CARD AND FRAME ARE ALL A BIT SOMBRE 
WAS IT BOUGHT OR HAS IT COME THROUGH THE FAMILY I THINK THROUGH THE FAMILY 
MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER HAD THEM FRAMED OH SO SHE ACTUALLY RECEIVED ALL THESE 
WE SHOULD EXPLAIN THESE ARE ALL LITTLE CARDS THEY WERE SENT DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
THEY WERE THEY WERE SENT BY HER BROTHER FROM DIFFERENT POSTS WHERE HE WAS BASED 
THAT'S RATHER TOUCHING AND PROBABLY NOT LONG AFTER THE WAR WAS FINISHED 
PROBABLY NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE THEY WERE FITTED UP IN THIS FRAME IT'S VERY TYPICAL FOR THE PERIOD 
THEY'VE ALL SURVIVED QUITE WELL 
THE ONLY SAD THING IS THAT POSSIBLY FROM BEING IN THE WARDROBE THEY'VE STARTED TO DEGRADE 
THEY'RE ALL EXTREMELY FINE FRENCH MADE OF WOVEN SILK 
SO THEY ARE FAIRLY PERISHABLE SO IT'S QUITE NICE TO SEE THEM ALL MOUNTED UP FOR A CHANGE 
INSTEAD OF IN AN ALBUM OR LOOSE 
THAT'S A GREAT HELP ANY IDEA WHAT THEY'RE WORTH NO IDEA AT ALL RIGHT RIGHT 
BECAUSE OF THE DISCOLOURATION THEY'RE NOT WORTH A FORTUNE 
BUT IT WOULD MAKE A LOVELY DISPLAY FOR SOMEONE WHO COLLECTS THEM 
THEY'RE PROBABLY IN THE REGION OF SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED RIGHT AT AUCTION 
WE COULD PUT A RESERVE OF SIXTY ON THEM RIGHT 
IS THERE ANY SENTIMENTAL ATTACHMENT TO THEM NOT REALLY NO 
WE LOVE LOOKING AT THEM BUT YOU'VE HAD THE ENJOYMENT OF THEM 
AND NOW YOU WANT TO PASS THEM ALONG POSSIBLY TO SOMEONE WHO WILL ENJOY THE SOCIAL HISTORY ELEMENT YES 
WE'LL POP THEM IN THE SALE AND HOPE THEY DO JOLLY WELL O. K. THANKS FOR BRINGING THEM THANK YOU 
OH LOTS OF LITTLE MEN ARE HIDING IN HERE I'M NOT SURE ABOUT LOVELY 
CAN I GET ONE OUT YES TOBY JUGS 
HOW SUPER MY WORD 
HE'S BEEN THROUGH THE WARS THERE'S A LITTLE ONE THAT'S SLIGHTLY BETTER 
OH WOW LOOK AT THAT DO YOU COLLECT THEM 
NO THEY'VE JUST COME THROUGH THE FAMILY 
O. K. DO YOU LIKE THEM ER NO 
THEY ARE AN ACQUIRED TASTE AREN'T THEY YEAH I THINK THEY'RE FUN THEY'RE LIKE EARLY CARTOONS 
LIKE SATIRICAL SKETCHES 
I LOVE THE EARLIER ONES THE ONES THAT ARE PRE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES NORMALLY HAVE THEIR FEET PROJECTING OUT 
THEY'RE WELL SOUGHT AFTER 
BUT IF HE WAS IN GOOD CONDITION HE'D BE IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
KEN YOU'VE BROUGHT ONE OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS IN 
THESE WONDERFUL SILVER ENAMEL SPOONS HOW DID THEY COME INTO YOUR POSSESSION 
WELL THIRTY OR MORE YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE FIRST FURNISHING A HOUSE WE PATRONISED SOME LOCAL AUCTIONS 
ON THE VISITS MY FATHER MADE OCCASIONALLY I TOOK HIM ALONG TO A FEW AUCTIONS AND HE GOT THE BUG 
NOW KNOWING HIM I KNOW HE WOULD NOT HAVE PAID MORE THAN ABOUT TEN FOR THOSE GOOD LORD 
THIS GOES BACK TO THE VERY EARLY SEVENTIES 
WHAT STRIKES ME THERE IS THAT IN THE EARLY PART OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
THESE SORT OF THINGS JUST WEREN'T FASHIONABLE NO SO YOU COULD PICK ALL SORTS OF WONDERFUL THINGS UP

WITH LOVELY ENAMEL AND STYLISED TULIP HEADS 
ANOTHER ONE I PARTICULARLY LIKE IS THIS ONE A VERY SIMPLE TWISTED STEM 
AND A LITTLE PEACOCK FEATHER IN LOVELY RICH GREEN AND BLUE COLOURS 
VERY INDICATIVE OF THE LIBERTY STYLE VERY MUCH SO 
THE WHOLE BOX SET IS WONDERFUL YOU RECKON HE PAID A TENNER 
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE EVER SPENT MORE THAN THAT 
WELL I THINK THIS WOULD EXCITE THE MARKET IT'S IN ITS ORIGINAL CASE 
WE'VE GOT LOVELY EXAMPLES THERE GOOD CONDITION 
AND I WOULD SUGGEST WE PUT THESE IN WITH AN ESTIMATE OF EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED 
YEAH WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT THAT WOULD BE FINE I THINK WITH A RESERVE OF EIGHT HUNDRED 
OH YES WE'LL PUT A RESERVE OF EIGHT HUNDRED 
I THINK THE AUCTIONEER IS GOING TO BE THRILLED WHEN HE OPENS THIS CASE 
HE'LL GO OH NO ANOTHER SET OF COFFEE SPOONS AND THEN HE'LL BE CHUFFED TO BITS 
I SUSPECT HE'LL PUT THEM IN THE CATALOGUE AND ON THE INTERNET
