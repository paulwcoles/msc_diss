THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER 
MOST OF US SAW SOME RAIN ON FRIDAY BUT THE MAIN FEATURE OF THE WEATHER 
WAS THE WIND A COLD EASTERLY WIND WHICH HAS STUCK AROUND ALL DAY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE SATELLITE SEQUENCE FROM EARLIER 
WITH THIS CLOUD IN THE BAY OF BISCAY LOTS OF CLOUD AROUND 
AND THAT BROUGHT SOME PATCHY RAIN WITH IT 
THAT'S ALL BUT FADED AWAY 
BUT IN THE EARLY HOURS 
THE NEXT PATCH OF RAIN PUSHING INTO THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES AND THE M. FOUR 
THE CLOUD KEEPS THE FROST AT BUT HOLES IN THE CLOUD FURTHER NORTH 
WILL LEAD TO FROST IN THE HIGHLANDS MINUS ONE MINUS TWO DEGREES 
SOUTH WALES WILL BE CLOUDY WINDY A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN CREEPING IN 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND A BRIGHT AND BREEZY START 
BUT A BIT OF CHILL IN THE AIR WHEN YOU ADD ON THE EFFECTS OF THE WIND 
BRIGHT AND BREEZY IN SCOTLAND THICKER CLOUD IN THE NORTH 
UP TOWARDS ORKNEY AND SHETLAND BUT LARGELY FINE AND DRY 
MUCH BRIGHTER START IN NORTHERN ENGLAND BUT STILL A NAGGING WIND 
FROM OFF THE NORTH SEA

A COLD FEEL WHEREVER YOU ARE ON THE SOUTH COAST NOT A PLEASANT START 
NOW LET'S JUST SEE HOW THE DAY DEVELOPS 
THE SOUTH COAST MAY JUST SEE THINGS DRYING UP AND MAY BRIGHTEN UP 
LATER ON IN THE DAY BUT THE MAIN AREA OF RAIN PUSHING NORTHWARDS 
TO CENTRAL WALES MAYBE INTO THE MIDLANDS FOR THE AFTERNOON
