THIS IS B. B. C. WORLD NEWS TODAY 
HILLARY CLINTON FIGHTS ON AFTER 
WINNING THE DECISIVE VICTORY IN 
PENNSYLVANIA WE ASK WHAT HAPPENS 
NEXT IN THE DEMOCRATIC RACE FOR THE 
WHITE HOUSE 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T QUIT AND 
THEY DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO 
DOESN'T QUIT EITHER 
DARFUR IS GETTING WORSE WARNS THE UN AND THERE IS NO 
PROSPECT OF THE PEACE IN SIGHT 
AND CHALLENGING STEREOTYPES ABOUT 
ISLAM AN EXHIBITION WHICH LETS 
BRITAIN'S MUSLIMS SPEAK FOR 
THEMSELVES AS THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
ARRIVES IN AUSTRALIA'S CAPITAL 
THERE ARE FEARS THAT THE CONTINUING 
PROCESS COULD DAMAGE TRADE 
RELATIONS WITH CHINA 
HELLO AND WELCOME ON THE NEXT 
STOP TO THE DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN 
TRAIL INDIANA AND NORTH CAROLINA 
MANY DEMOCRATS HAD HOPED THAT THE 
BOXING MATCH BETWEEN HILLARY 
CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA WOULD COME 
TO AN END BUT HILLARY'S VICTORY BY 
A COMFORT COMFORTABLE TEN PER CENT 
MARGIN SHE HASN'T BEEN KNOCKED OUT 
YET IN TERMS OF TOTAL NUMBERS 
BARACK OBAMA IS AHEAD AND THE NEXT 
ROUND OF THIS BLOODY AND 
POTENTIALLY DAMAGING BATTLE FOR THE 
DEMOCRATS IS ON MAY SIXTH WHEN BOTH 
CANDIDATES ARE CAMPAIGNING IN 
INDIANA INDIANA WE CAN GO LIVE TO WASHINGTON TALK 
US THROUGH THE NEXT STAGE OF THE 
RACE 
WE ARE GOING AS YOU SAY TO RACE IND AND I. A. AND TO NORTH CAROLINA 
NORTH CAROLINA IS A STATE WHERE 
BARACK OBAMA IS EXPECTED TO ON WIN 
INDIANA MUCH CLOSER RACE THERE 
NOW IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA 
BARACK OBAMA OUTSPENT HILLARY 
CLINTON BY A FACTOR OF TWO HE 
SPENT TWICE AS MUCH AS HILLARY 
CLINTON CAMPAIGNING THERE IT 
DIDN'T WORK FOR HIM AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC RACE TO THE NOMINATION 
GOES ON 
PENNSYLVANIA THIS OLD RUGGED STATE 
HAS KEPT HILLARY CLINTON'S 
PRESIDENTIAL HOPES ALIVE JUST 
THIS MRS. CLINTON NEEDED A BIG WIN 
HERE AND SHE GOT ONE BEATING 
BARACK OBAMA SOUNDLY THIS MORNING 
SHE FACED AMERICA'S BROADCASTING 
DIVA DIANE SAWYER 
WE SAW 
PRESIDENT CLINTON TONNE COME UP AND 
GIVE MAYBE ONE OF THE LONGEST HUGS 
WE'VE SEEN ON STAGE IN A LONG TIME 
WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU DURING THE 
COURSE OF THAT 
WELL HE WAS JUST 
SO HAPPY BECAUSE HE KNOWS A LOT 
ABOUT WHAT IT IT MEANS TO BE A P. HE 
WAS JUST TELLING ME HOW PROUD HE 
WASHINGS AND HOW EXCITED HE WAS 
AND WE ARE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE WITH 
ALL OUR HEART THAT THIS COUNTRY IS 
WORTH FIGHTING FOR 
HER CAMPAIGN'S SHORT OF FUNDS HER 
PUBLIC PERSONA IS LOOKING BATTERED 
BUT SHE WILL NOT QUIT AND HER 
SUPPORTERS LOVE HER FOR IT SOME 
DEMOCRATS ARE WORK THIS RACE IS 
GOING ON TOO LONG AND IT'S DAMAGING 
THE PARTY OTHERS SAY NO IT'S 
TOUGHENING THE CANDIDATES UP BEFORE 
THEY FACE THE REPUBLICANS IN THE 
RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AS THE 
RESULTS CAME IN BARACK OBAMA WAS 
ALREADY OFF IN INDIANA THIS IS 
WHERE THE NEXT VOTE WILL BE HELD ON 
MAY SIXTH ALONG WITH NORTH CAROLINE 
NA 
YOU CAN DECIDE WHETHER WE'RE NA GOING TO TRAVEL THE SAME WORN PATH 
OR WHETHER WE WILL CHART A NEW 
COURSE THAT OFFERS REAL HOPE FOR 
THE FUTURE 
HE'S WON MORE VOTES 
MORE STATES MORE DELEGATES THAN 
HILLARY CLINTON AND HE'S RAISED A 
LOT MORE MONEY TO FUEL HIS CAMPAIGN 
THIS IS BARAK OBAMA'S RACE TO LOSE 
NOW NOW BUT EVERYTHING REALLY DEPENDS ON 
WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S BIG 
POWER BROKERS DECIDE TO DO THEY 
COULD WIND THIS RACE UP QUITE 
QUICKLY BUT OBAMA'S LOSS IN 
PENNSYLVANIA WILL GIVE THEM PAUSE 
OBAMA'S ENTERTAINMENT WAS PROVIDED 
BY THE ROCKER JOHN MENNENCAMP BUT 
HE'S GOING TO PLAY AT A HILLARY 
CLINTON EVENT TOO APPARENTLY LIKE 
THE DEMOCRATIC HE DOESN'T TOME TO 
BE ABLE TO MAKE UP HIS MIND SO NOW 
WE TURN TO THE SUPER DELEGATES THE 
GREAT AND GOOD OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY WHO IT SEEMS WILL HAVE THE 
CASTING VOTE OVER THE NEXT WEEKS 
AND PERHAPS MONTHS AS TO WHO 
BECOMES THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE 
WE KEEP ON HEARING IN IN ELECTION 
THAT MOMENTUM IS EVERYTHING WHO 
HAS THE MOMENTUM NOW DO YOU THINK 
WELL UNTIL YESTERDAY WOULD YOU 
HAVE SAID BARACK OBAMA I THINK 
BUT HILLARY CLINTON HAS CERTAINLY 
PUT A CRIMP IN BARRACK'S MOMENTUM 
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER 
THAT THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THIS 
PERCEPTIONS AND MOMENTUM AND WHO IS 
SEEN TO BE A WINNING CANDIDATE AND 
THEN THE MATHEMATICS THE 
COMPLICATED CALCULATION AS TO WHO 
WINS ENOUGH DELEGATES TO ACTUALLY 
CLINCH THE NOMINATION AT THE 
DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IT'S A 
COMPLEX COMBINATION MUCH THOSE TWO 
FACTORS WHICH WILL FINALLY WORK 
THIS OUT THE MATHS IS ON THE SIDE 
OF BARACK OBAMA BROADLY I THINK 
PERCEPTIONS ARE STILL ON THE SIDE 
OF BARACK OBAMA BUT THE CLINTON 
CAMPAIGN CLEARLY FEELS HAS MADE 
ITS CALCULATION THAT IT'S NOT WORTH 
GIVING UP YET THAT SOMETHING COULD 
STILL HAPPEN TO TURN THIS AROUND IN 
HER FAVOUR 
LET'S LOOK NOW AT THE HISTORY OF 
THE PRIMARIES IN THE U. S. ELECTIONS 
HAS THE CLOSE RACE HAD ANY IMPACT 
ON THE FINAL RESULT ACCORDING TO 
HISTORIANS THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF 
PARTIES ENDURING BRUISING BATTLES 
IN THE PRIMARY BUT STILL WINNING 
OUT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE THE 
POLITICAL LANDSCAPE'S CHANGED SINCE 
NINETEEN TWELVE WHEN THE PRIMARIES SAW THEIR 
FIRST CLOSE CONTEST THEODORE RAOS 
WELL WON THE POPULAR VOTE IN THE 
REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES THE PARTY 
CHOOSING WILLIAM TAFT AS ITS 
CANDIDATE INSTEAD THE FINAL WINNER 
WAS DEMOCRAT WOODROW WILSON NINETEEN FIFTY 
TWO SAW A BOTH PRIMARY RACE FOR 
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS KERFOUR 
TOOK AN EARLY LEAD FROM PRESIDENT 
HARRY TRUE MAN BUT IN THE END THE 
PARTY NOMINATED A CANDIDATE WHO 
WASN'T EVEN RUNNING AND THE 
RESULT THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE 
GENERAL DWIGHT EISENHOWER WHO HAD 
ALSO SURVIVED A BLOODY BATTLE IN 
THE PRIMARIES GOT THE KEYS TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE FAST FORWARD TO NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
AND A KEY PLAYER WAS TELEVISION 
THIS PROVED A DISADVANTAGE TO VAO 
IP HUBERT HUMPHREYS WHO DIDN'T RUN 
IN THE IN THE PRIMARIES BUT MANAGED 
TO CLINCH THE THE DEMOCRATIC 
NOMINATION THE RESULT WAS HE LOST 
TO NIXON 
THE EXPANSION OF MEDIA COVERAGE HAS 
MADE IT MORE AND MORE NECESSARY TO 
ENTER A RACE EARLY AND DO WELL IN 
THE PRIMARIES SO FOR NOW IT'S ALL 
EYES ON INDIANA AND NORTH CAROLINA 
JOINING US IS PETER FENN A 
DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND SERVED AS 
AN ADVISER TO AL GORE HE'S NOT 
AFFILIATED WITH EITHER THE OBAMA OR 
CLINTON CAMPAIGN PETER FENN WE'VE 
SEEN THIS FIGHT BETWEEN OBAMA AND 
CLINTON GET NASTY OVER THE PAST 
COUPLE OF WEEKS DO YOU THINK IT'S 
GOING TO GET UGLIER NOW 
I THINK 
THERE IS THAT POTENTIAL PARTLY 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO CANDIDATES WHO 
AGREE ON MOST MAJOR ISSUES SO WHAT 
HAPPENS IS THINGS GET PERSONAL YOU 
HAVE A DISCUSSION OF A MISTAKE OR A 
GAFFE OR BOSNIA WHETHER OR NOT 
THERE WERE BULLETS FLYING OVER 
HILLARY'S HEAD OR WHAT BARACK OBAMA 
SAID AT A FUND RAISER IN SAN 
FRANCISCO ABOUT RURAL VOTERS IN 
PENNSYLVANIA AND THAT'S DANGEROUS 
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IF IT GOES 
ON TOO LONG BECAUSE THEN WHAT 
HAPPENS OBVIOUSLY IS YOU GET YOUR 
BASE WHO HAVE UP TO THIS POINT BEEN 
UNBELIEVABLY EXCITED AND ENGAGED IN 
THIS CAMPAIGN THEY GET DISPIRITED 
SORT OF ANGRY THEY GET VERY VERY 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE OTHER CANDIDATE 
AND THEY TALK ABOUT EVEN VOTING FOR 
THE REPUBLICAN OR OR SITTING OR 
THEIR HANDS 
IS THERE AN ARGUMENT 
DO YOU THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS 
CAMPAIGN IS LONG AND NASTY IT 
COULD BENEFIT THE DEMOCRATS IN THE 
LONG RUN BECAUSE IT KEEPS THEM IN 
THE PUBLIC EYE 
I HAVE FELT THAT UP 
TO THIS POINT AND I TELL YOU I 
THINK THE KEY TIME FRAME HERE IS 
THE NEXT FIVE WEEKS I THINK THIS 
THING HAS GOT TO BE DECIDED BY JUNE 
IF IT'S NOT THEN WE REALLY GET 
INTO TROUBLE GOING INTO THE SUMMER 
WE HAVE A CONVENTION AT THE END OF 
AUGUST WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL OF 
BEING A REAL DONNYBROOK AND 
SIMILAR TO NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHERE YOU MENTIONED 
HUBERT HUMPHREY WON THE NOMINATION 
HE WAS SO DAMAGED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE 
TO WIN THE GENERAL ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT DOES HAPPEN HERE IS 
THAT YOU GET STORIES LIKE REVEREND 
WRIGHT OUT THERE NOW YOU GET THESE 
CANDIDATES BEING VETTED BY VOTERS 
BY PRIMARY VOTERS AND THEY DO GET 
TOUGHENED UP LOOK RIGHT NOW 
THEIR SKINS BOTH OF THEM I THINK 
IT'S LIKE ALLIGATOR SKIN IT'S HARD 
TO PENETRATE I THINK THEN THEY 
ALSO GET INTO A RHYTHM OF THE 
CAMPAIGN THEY'RE USED TO THE 
DEBATES AND THE GIVE AND TAKE 
BACK AND FORTH THAT'S VERY VERY 
IMPORTANT TO MAKE A CANDIDATE 
STRONGER AS THEY GO INTO THE FALL 
DO YOU HAVE SENSE ABOUT WHETHER 
THERE IS MOVEMENT BEHIND THE SCENES 
BEEN THE DEMOCRATIC MACHINE TO 
BRING THIS BATTLE TO AN EARLIER 
CLOSE SO IT IT DOESN'T GO ON ON 
UNTIL THE CONVENTION IN AUGUST 
THERE DEFINITELY IS IS THERE IS A 
REALLY CONCERN HERE THAT IF THIS 
GETS VERY PERSONAL AND VERY UGLY 
ALL THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TO DO IS 
JUST SIT BACK AS WE'RE DIGGING OUR 
OWN GRAVES AND SO I THINK THAT THE 
CHAIRMAN OUR DEANE THAT THE 
MAJORITY LEADER THE SPEAKER OF THE 
HOUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
LOOK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE 
SOME DECISIONS HERE WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE TO MOVE THE THE TROUBLE RIGHT 
NOW IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE 
PRIMARIES COMING UP IN THE CAUCUS 
STATES THERE ARE NINE OF THEM AND 
IF YOU DO THE MATH RIGHT NOW AND 
EVEN IF YOU GIVE INDIANA WHICH WE 
JUST TALKED ABOUT TO HILLARY 
CLINTON SHE COMES BACK THEN WITH 
THAT STAKE YOU PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT 
FIVE STATES TO GO WITH BARACK OBAMA 
FOUR STATES TO GO WITH HILLARY 
CLINTON AND THE DELEGATE SPLIT IS 
ABOUT EVEN SO YOU KNOW IT IS 
LIKELY TO BE I THINK VERY VERY 
TIGHT BUT STILL OBAMA HAS THE MOST 
DELEGATES OBAMA HAS THE MOST 
POPULAR VOTE AND BY ALMOST TWO TO 
ONE HE'S ONE 
JUST BRIEFLY ON THAT 
POINT PENNSYLVANIA DOES RAISE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT OBAMA'S ABILITY TO 
WIN IN FORMER INDUSTRIAL AREAS TO 
WIN THAT WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTE 
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR OBAMA HE 
HAS GOT TO PROVE TO SUPER DELEGATES 
THAT HE CAN WIN IN NOVEMBER AND IN 
THE BIG STATES ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE 
IS THE EXIT POLLS SHOWED THAT BY 
OVER TWO TO ONE VOTERS WERE 
CONCERNED MORE ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
THAN THEY WERE WITH IRAQ HE HAS TO 
COMMUNICATE WITH VOTERS ON THE 
ECONOMIC ISSUES HE HAS TO WIN 
SENIOR CITIZENS THOSE OVER SIXTY FIVE 
THAT HE LOST BY ALMOST TWO TO ONE 
HE HAS TO WIN THE LUNCH BUDGET 
DEMOCRATS HE HAS TO WIN THE 
TRADITIONAL VOTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY AS WELL AS ALL THOSE NEW 
PEOPLE THAT HE'S BROUGHT INTO THIS 
SYSTEM DURING THE CAMPAIGN 
PETER FENN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE LATEST REPORT FROM THE UN'S MAN 
IN DARFUR MAKES PRETTY DEPRESSING 
READING THE HUMANITARIAN CHIEF 
JOHN HOLMES TOLD THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL THAT THEY NOW THINK AS MANY 
AS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MAY HAVE DIED IN 
THE FIVE YEAR CONFLICT IN SUDAN 
FIFTY PER CENT MORE THAN THEY PREVIOUSLY 
ESTIMATED AND WHAT'S MORE THE 
SITUATION ACCORDING TO THE UN IS 
NOT GETTING ANY BETTER AND HELP IS 
A LONG WAY OFF BECAUSE THE JOINT UN 
AFRICAN UNION PEACEKEEPING FORCE 
FOR DARFUR WON'T BE FULLY 
OPERATIONAL UNTIL NEXT YEAR 
FOR THOUSANDS THE LIVING HELL 
GRINDS ON FAMILIES KEEPING POURING 
OVER THE BORDER INTO CHAD 
DESPERATE AFTER PLANES FIRST BOMBED 
THEIR VILLAGES AND THEN SUDANESE 
SOLDIERS AND MILITIA SHOT AT THEM 
AS THEY TRIED TO ESCAPE BUT AT 
LEAST THEY HAVE SURVIVED NOW NEW 
FIGURES SUGGEST THE NUMBERS OF DEAD 
IN THIS WAR ARE FAR WORSE THAN 
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT 
THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN NEW YORK 
WAS GIVEN THE REVIVED TOTAL OF 
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND KILLED AND A BLEAK PICTURE 
FOR THE SURVIVORS 
SO DARFUR TODAY 
IS STILL CHARACTERISED BY 
INSECURITY LAWLESSNESS AND 
IMPUNITY THE EFFECTS ON CIVILIANS 
ARE NOT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A 
PARTICULAR WORRYING FEATURE IS 
EVIDENCE OF HIGH LEVELS OF SEXUAL 
VIOLENCE AND EXPLOITATION IN THE 
NORTHERN CORE DOF OF WEST DARFUR 
OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS EXACTLY EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN 
SUDAN'S FIVE YEAR CONFLICT IS IN 
DISPUTE THE LATEST ASSESSMENT IS 
HOTLY CONTESTED BY THE STEWED NIECE 
AMBASSADOR TO THE UN 
THE RISK OF EVEN A SINGLE SUDANESE 
THE DEATH OF A SINGLE SUDANESE IS 
SOMETHING VERY REGRETTABLE AND 
TRAGIC BUT ON OUR OWN CALCULATION 
THE TOTAL NUMBER DOES NOT EXCEED 
TEN THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND THAT REFERS ONLY TO THOSE WHO DIED 
IN COMBAT SOME BELIEVE THE TOTAL 
FIGURE COULD BE EVEN HIGHER THAN 
THE UN ESTIMATE 
BUT KHARTOUM REFUSES TO ALLOW 
MORTALITY STUDIES TO BE CONDUCTED 
IN DARFUR IN IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S 
MOST INTRACTABLE CONFLICTS SINCE 
REBELS ATTACKED A GARRISON TOWN IN 
NORTH DARFUR STATE IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND THREE 
IT'S BECOME EVER MORE COMPLEX THE 
TWO ORIGINAL REBELS GROUPS HAVE 
MULTIPLIED AND FORGING AN EFFECTIVE 
PEACE DEAL WITH KHARTOUM HAS PROVED 
IMPOSSIBLE THE FALLOUT IS A 
REFUGEE CRISIS OF BIBLICAL 
PROPORTIONS THE CAMPS IN DARFUR 
ARE HOME TO NEARLY TWENTY FIVE MILLION 
PEOPLE ANOTHER HALF A MILLION LIVE 
OVER THE BORDER IN CHAD 
AT THE ARRIVAL OF AND THE ARRIVAL 
OF PEACEKEEPERS HASN'T STEPPED THE 
BLOOD SHED THERE ARE TOO FEW 
LESS THAN FORTY PER CENT OF WHAT IS NEEDED 
AND THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAS HEARD 
THAT THE FULL FORCE OF UN AND 
AFRICAN UNION TROOPS WON'T BE UP 
TO STRENGTH UNTIL NEXT YEAR 
A FORCE IS IS OUR AS 
FAR ASS ARE SERVING UNDER 
EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES FACING 
DAILY DANGERS AND HARDSHIPS AND I'M 
OBLIGED TO REPORT THAT THE 
OBSTACLES THEY CAN SURMOUNT AND THE 
RISKS THAT THEY HAVE RUN HAVE NOT 
REDUCED OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
CENSUS TAKERS HAVE BEGUN THEIR WORK 
PART OF A PLAN TO HELP THE WARRING 
ETHNIC GROUPS COME TO A POWER 
SHARING DEAL BUT EVEN BEFORE IT IS 
COMPLETE IT IS BEING UNDERMINED 
IT IS HARD TO SEE A WAY OUT OF THE 
CRISIS 
IT IS TWENTY SIX DAYS SINCE ZIMBABWE'S 
ELECTIONS AND THERE ARE STILL NO 
RESULTS PUBLISHED MEANWHILE THE 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION ANNOUNCED THE 
RESULTS OF A RECOUNT IN A 
PARLIAMENTARY VOTE WHICH GAVE END 
OF THE SEA TO ROBERT MUGABE'S ZANU 
P. F. PARTY TWENTY TWO MORE CONSTITUENCIES 
ARE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING IT 
RECOUNTS BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER 
GORDON BROWN TODAY CALLED FOR AN 
INTERNATIONAL ARMS EMBARGO AGAINST 
ZIMBABWE AFTER A SHIPMENT OF 
CHINESE WEAPONS WILL STOP US FROM 
REACHING THE COUNTRY 
WAS STOPPED FROM 
MORE VICTIMS OF THEIR TERROR 
CAMPAIGN IN ZIMBABWE AND NOW 
SICKENING EVIDENCE OF TORTURE THIS 
MAN HAD MOLTEN PLASTIC GRIP ON HIS 
BACK PUNISHMENT FOR VOTING THE 
WRONG WAY FOR THE OPPOSITION TO 
STOP OTHERS HAVE BEEN KICKED 
BEATEN WITH STICKS AND WHIPPED THE

A STATE OF WAR ON A TRIP TO EUROPE 
THE LEADER OF SOUTH AFRICA'S 
DOMINANT POLITICAL PARTY SAID THAT 
THE COUNTRY WAS COMMITTED TO 
FINDING A SOLUTION FOR ZIMBABWE HE 
SPOKE TO REPORTERS IN DOWNING 
STREET 
SOUTH AFRICA HAS BEEN STREET GIVING MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE SINCE 
THE BEGINNING OF THE PROBLEMS IN 
ZIMBABWE UP UNTIL NOW WE HAVE BEEN 
ENGAGING THE ZIMBABWEANS ON BOTH 
SIDES WE HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING 
IN THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM 
INTERNATIONAL CONCERN ABOUT 
ZIMBABWE IS GROWING IN THE BRITISH 
PARLIAMENT THE PRIME MINISTER SAID 
IT WAS TIME TO SEIZE THE SALE OF 
WEAPONS TO ZIMBABWE 
I CALL ON THE 
WHOLE WORLD TO EXPRESS ITS VIEW 
THAT THIS IS COMPLETELY 
UNACCEPTABLE TO THE WHOLE OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY RIBALD 
PROMOTER BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED IN SOUTH AFRICA WHETHER 
IT IS WHERE THERE IS AN ARMS 
SHIPMENT TRYING TO GET TO ZIMBABWE 
WE WILL PROMOTE AN EMBARGO ON ALL 
ARMS TO ZIMBABWE AND AT THE SAME 
TIME WE ASK FOR ALL OF THE AFRICAN 
UNION OBSERVERS AND INTERNATIONAL 
OBSERVERS TO MAKE THEIR VIEWS KNOWN 
ABOUT THE UNFAIRNESS OF THIS 
ELECTION FEAST OF THE ARMS SHIPMENT 
HE REFERRED TO IS ON BOARD A 
CHINESE VESSEL SOMEWHERE OFF THE 
SOUTHERN AFRICAN COAST 
THE PRECISE 
WHEREABOUTS OF THE SHIP ARE NOT 
KNOWN BUT AFRICAN COUNTRIES 
NEIGHBOURING ZIMBABWE AND THE 
CHINESE ARE COMING UNDER PRESSURE 
NOT TO ALLOW THE SHIP TO DISCHARGE 
ITS CARGO MORTARS PROP ROCKET 
PROPELLED GRENADES AND AMMUNITION 
FOR AUTOMATIC WEAPONS IT IS NO 
GOING BUT THE PARTIAL RECOUNT OF 
TWENTY THREE CONSTITUENCIES FROM THE ELECTION 
THREE WEEKS AGO IN ZIMBABWE IS 
MAKING PROGRESS ONE SEED CHALLENGED 
BY THE OPPOSITION HAS BEEN 
CONFIRMED AS A ZANU P. F. WIN OTHER 
RESULTS SHOULD COME IN IN THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS THE GOVERNING PARTY NEEDS 
TO OVERTURN NINE SEATS TO WIN

ORGANISED AND HIGHLY MOTIVATED FOUR HUNDRED 
PLAN TO MOUNT A PROTEST IN THE

DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY GOLD RUSH 
WHEN THE FEAR OF CHINESE 
IMMIGRATION LED TO A AUSTRALIAN 
POLICY COMMERCIAL AND CULTURAL 
TIES OF THE PUDDING PROSPERING 
FROM CHINA'S RAPID GROWTH 
AUSTRALIA'S PRIME MINISTER SERVED 
AS A DIPLOMAT IN CHINA STUDIED ITS 
HISTORY AND CULTURE AS A STUDENT 
AND SPEAKS FLUENT MANDARIN HE 
FEELS ESPECIALLY WELL QUALIFIED 
BOTH AS AN EXPIRED AND HE SAYS A 
FRIEND TO TO ENGAGE WITH BEIJING 
DURING HIS SPEECH TO STUDENTS IN 
BEIJING EARLIER THIS MONTH HE SAID 
THERE WAS A LIVING HUMAN RIGHTS 
PROBLEMS INTO BED THE STRONGEST 
PUBLIC REBUKE EVER DELIVERED BY AN 
AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER ON 
CHINESE SOIL THE CHINESE STUDENTS 
ARE RECEIVING A PART OF THEIR 
EDUCATION IN SYDNEY THEY ARE BEING 
URGED ON VARIOUS WEBSITES TO TRAVEL 
TO CANBERRA TO PROTECT AND DEFEND 
THE FLAME WITH TEN THOUSAND EXPECTED TO 
MAKE THE JOURNEY WILL IT TURN OUT 
TO BE A PIECE FOR A SHOW OF FORCE 
PIECE ALL SHOW 
IT AN EXHIBITION HAS OPENED IN 
LONDON AIMED TO CHALLENGE 
STEREOTYPES ABOUT MUSLIMS A RECENT 
STUDY FOUND A FOUND THAT TOO 
OFTEN MUSLIMS ARE PORTRAYED AS ONE 
HOMOGENOUS GROUP THIS EXHIBITION 
LET MUSLIMS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES 
ABOUT THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO BRITISH 
SOCIETY 
A RARE GLIMPSE OF WHAT IT IS LIKE 
TO BE MUSLIM AND A LONDONER A 
COMMON FATE UNITE PEOPLE DIVIDED BY 
DIFFERENT CUSTOMS CULTURES AND 
GEOGRAPHIC ORIGINS A CITY WHERE 
THREE HUNDRED LANGUAGES ARE SPOKEN THE 
EXHIBITION HAD TO DOCUMENT THE 
GROWING PAINS OF WHAT IS THERE 
BRITAIN'S SECOND LARGEST RELIGION 
THIS MAN WAS BORN AND BROUGHT UP IN 
LONDON AS A BLACK CAB DRIVER HE 
KNOWS THE CITY LIKE THE BACK OF HIS 
HAND COME WHAT MAY EVERY FRIDAY 
HE COMES TO PRAY HERE IT IS A SIGN 
OF HOW MANY MUSLIMS LIVE IN LONDON 
THAT THIS MOSQUE USED TO BE A 
CHURCH BUT EVEN TODAY THE TURKISH 
IMAM PRAISE FOR THE HELP OF THE 
QUEEN OF ENGLAND HE SAYS WHERE 
EVERY U. TURN ISLAM IS THE MAJOR 
TOPIC OF DEBATE HE PUTS IT DOWN TO 
THE LONDON BOMBINGS BY MUSLIM 
TERRORISTS FREED YEARS AGO AND 
ADMITS MUSLIMS THEMSELVES HAVE TO 
SORT OUT A HANDFUL OF EXTREMISTS 
WHO GIVE THE REST OF THEM A BAD 
NAME 
ONE OF THE MUSLIMS ARE NAME PORTRAYED ALL SPOKEN ABOUT IT IS 
TRUE EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE ARE WELL 
MEANING IT IS DONE WITH IGNORANCE 
PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THE 
REALITY OF ISLAM ALL THEY KNOW IS 
THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE STRAPPED BOMBS 
TO THEMSELVES AND BLOW OTHER PEOPLE 
UP THAT IS WHAT THEY THINK ISLAM 
IS ANYBODY WHO HAS ANY KNOWLEDGE 
OF ISLAM KNOWS THAT NOTHING COULD 
BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH IN 
REALITY I AM HUGELY WORRIED ABOUT 
THE WAY ISLAM IS PORTRAYED AND 
MUSLIMS ARE PORTRAYED THEY ARE NO 
DIFFERENT FROM ANYBODY ELSE 
SINAI MAHMOOD IS HALF PAKISTANI 
HALF SCOTTISH SHE WAS BROUGHT UP 
IN SOUTH LONDON SHE IS STUDYING TO 
BE A DOCTOR SHE IS A TRUSTEE OF 
THIS MUSLIM WOMEN'S CENTRE SINCE 
CHILDHOOD SHE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN 
HELPING HER LOCAL COMMUNITY 
ESPECIALLY WOMEN HE MACRO SHE FEELS 
ARE BADLY MISUNDERSTOOD WHO SHE 
FEELS 
MANY PEOPLE THINK MUSLIM FEELS WOMEN DO NOT HAVE A VOICE DO NOT 
HAVE ANY OPINIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED 
TO EXPRESS THOSE OPINIONS THAT IS 
WRONG THE OPINIONS ABOUT MUSLIMS 
IN GENERAL IS THAT THEY ARE VERY 
STRICT THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY FUN 
WHICH IS ALSO NOT TRUE IT IS A 
GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO SEE 
MUSLIM PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT 
COUNTRIES DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS 
AND CULTURES SEE HOW DIFFERENT WE 
ARE BUT WE ALL HAVE A COMMON 
BELIEF AND A COMMON RELIGION A 
COMMON GOAL THAT WE BELIEVE HIM IT IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT PHOTOGRAPHY CAN 
BE A WEAPON TO FIGHT VIOLENCE BUT 
THIS EXHIBITION IS PART OF A 
GOVERNMENT FUNDED PROGRAMME TO 
COUNTER MUSLIM EXTREMISM IT IS ALL 
ABOUT SHOWING THAT MUSLIMS OF HUMAN 
BEINGS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE A SIGN 
PERHAPS OF HOW BAD THINGS HAVE GOT 
AN EXHIBITION OF THIS KIND SHOULD 
NOT HAVE TO HAPPEN BUT THE REALITY 
IS THAT THIS KIND OF EXHIBITION 
MUST TAKE PLACE BECAUSE IT IS 
ABOUT CAPTURING IMAGES OF PEOPLE 
BUT ALSO HELPING THEM TO TELL THEIR 
STORIES IT IS ABOUT CAPTURING THE 
BOYS OF ISLAM AND THIS IS ANOTHER 
IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THIS 
EXHIBITION IT IS ABOUT GIVING THE 
PLATFORM TO THE MODERATE VOICE OF 
ISLAM WHICH IS A STRONG VOICE THAT 
NEEDS TO BE HEARD 
THERE ARE NO 
MARTYRDOM VIDEOS HERE NO TALK OF 
JIHAD AND NO BOMB BLASTS THIS IS 
AN EXHIBITION ABOUT SHOWCASING THE 
VERY ORDINARINESS OF MUSLIM LIVES 
IN LONDON SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT 
HAPPEN HIT THE HEADLINES 
A REMINDER OF ALAN MAIN STORY 
HILLARY CLINTON HAS PLEDGED TO 
FIGHT ON IN THE DEMOCRATIC 
PRESIDENTIAL RACE FOR THE WHITE
