REPORTING FROM THE THAMES ON THE 
INVASION OF THE CHINESE MITTEN CRAB 
IT'S BECOME ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
CIVIL LAWSUITS THIS COUNTRY HAS 
EVER SEEN A THOUSAND VETERANS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES HAVE NOW JOINED 
TOGETHER TO TAKE THE MINISTRY OF 
DEFENCE TO COURT OVER THE ATOMIC 
BOMB TESTING IN THE INDIAN OCEAN 
EMMA NORTH HAS BEEN TO MEET TWO 
FAMILIES WHOSE LIVES THEY CLAIM 
HAVE BEEN RUINED BY THE TESTS ON 
CHRISTMAS ISLAND 
LIKE A MAN MADE 
SUN THE FIREBALL GLOWS HIGH ABOVE 
THE PACIFIC OCEAN A SIG GAL TO THE 
WORLD THAT GREAT BRITAIN IS NOW A 
TOP RANKING POWER OF THIS NUCLEAR 
AGE 
ALL THE TROOPS HAD THEIR BACKS AGE TO THE BLAST SQUATTING DOWN THE 
EYES CLOSED HANDS AGAINST YOUR 
EYES WITH AND THE FLASH COMES OUT 
YOU SEE THE BONES OF YOUR HANDS 
ALTHOUGH YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED AND 
YOU ARE FACING AWAY FROM THE BLAST 
THEY SERVED IN THE PACIFIC HELPING 
THE NUCLEAR BOMB TESTS NOW FIFTY 
YEARS LATER DONALD JAMES AND A 
THOUSAND OTHERS HAVE JOINED FORCES 
AGAIN BUT THIS TIME TO SUE THE 
MINISTRY THAT SENT THEM THERE WHY WHY LIKE TO SEE RECOGNITION THAT TROOPS 
WERE SENT OUT THERE NOT KNOWING 
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM 
AND COMPENSATION FOR THE CHILDREN 
AND THE FAMILIES 
DONALD FROM 
WESTMINSTER HAS A PAINFUL BLOOD 
DISORDER HE CLAIMS IS BECAUSE OF 
WHAT HE WAS EXPOSED TO BUT HE SAYS 
HE IS LUCKY SHIRLEY DENSON'S R. A. F. 
PILOT HUSBAND WAS ORDERED TO FLY 
THROUGH THE MUSHROOM CLOUD ABOVE 
CHRISTMAS ISLAND EIGHTEEN YEARS LATER HE 
TOOK HIS OWN LIFE 
HE USED TO HOLD 
HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SAY GOD 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN MY HEAD I 
WOULD HOLD HIM BECAUSE HE 
OBVIOUSLY WAS SO VERY DISTRESSED 
BUT THERE WAS NO HELP ANYWHERE 
SHAIRL CLAIMS SHE HAS EVIDENCE HER 
HUSBAND WAS EXPOSED TO THE 
EQUIVALENT OF TWELVE ZERO X. RAY IN THIS 
SIX MINUTES 
SHIRLEY AND T. H. E. ZERO ZERO ZERO WITH HER HOPE 
THEIR VOIRS ALSO NOW BE HEARD AT 
TIME WHEN THEY CLAIM THE TREATMENT 
OF BRITISH SOLDIERS SAY THOSE IN 
POWER FIND AN UNCOMFORTABLE SUBJECT 
STANDING ROOM ONLY A FAMILIAR 
PROBLEM FOR THOUSANDS OF COMMUTERS 
BUT ONE SEASON TICKET HOLDER 
THOUGHT IT WAS NOT UNREASONABLE TO 
STAND IN A FIRST CLASS CARRIAGE ON 
A PACKED TRAIN NICHOLA MYHILL SAID 
THERE WAS NO ROOM ANYWHERE ELSE 
HER DECISION LAND HER WITH FINE 
PHIL TELL US MORE 
WELCOME TO EUSTON STATION VERY 
BUSY TONIGHT AS COMMUTERS WHO 
COMMUTE IN AND OUT OF LONDON EVERY 
DAY LEAVE THIS AND THE OTHER 
TERMINALS OF THE CAPITAL BUT MANY 
WILL BE TRAVELLING ON SEASON 
TICKETS WHICH COAST THOUSANDS OF 
POUNDS TO GET YOU TO AND FROM YOUR 
DESTINATION BUT DON'T NECESSARILY 
GRANT YOU SEAT ONE WOMAN WHO 
TRAVELLED FROM LIVERPOOL STREET TO 
COLCHESTER FOUND THAT OUT THE HARD 
WAY WAS THIS YOUR MORNING RUSH 
INTO WORK YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN 
ON THE EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FROM SAINT ALBANS BUT THE 
CROWDS COULD BE A FAMILIAR SITE IF 
YOU COMMUTE FROM THE OUTSIDE YOU YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CHANCE OF GETTING A 
SEAT 
YOU AT LEAST EXPECT TO BE SEAT ABLE TO STAND UP WITHOUT BEING 
CRUSHED 
NICHOLA MYHILL TRAVEL IN CRUSHED THIS ON A NATIONAL EXPRESS TRAIN TO 
LONDON EVERY DAY BUT ONE NIGHT 
THERE WAS NO STANDING ROOM SO SHE 
WAITED IN FIRST CLASS AND SHE GOT A 
SHOCK 
I WAS TOLD I SHOULDN'T BE SHOCK THERE I WAS TOLD I KNOW I SHOULDN'T 
BE HERE BUT WHERE DO YOU WANT ME 
TO GO TEN MINUTES LATER INTO MY 
JOURNEY TWO TICKET INSPECTORS CAME 
THE OTHER WAY UP THE TRAIN AND 
FINED US 
LIVING OUTSIDE LONDON MAY 
SAVER CASH ON HOUSE PRICES BUT 
GETTING THE TRAIN IN ISN'T CHEAP 
HERE ARE SOME PRICES FOR THE 
REGULAR COMMUNITIES IT IS 
DISTANCE DEPENDENT WHEN DOES A 
CROWDED TRAIN JOURNEY BECOME AN 
OVERCROWDED TRAIN JOURNEY THE 
GOVERNMENT RECKONS IT IS WHEN THIRTY FIVE 
PEOPLE OR MORE ARE STANDING FOR 
EVERY ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE SITTING OUTSIDE 
LONDON THE NUMBERS ARE MORE VAGUE 
BUT PASSENGER FOCUS RECKONS EVERY 
DAY SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE FORCE TO DO 
STAND ON THEIR WAY THAT MAY BE WHY 
SOME COMMUTERS FEEL THEY HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO MOVE INTO THE ROOMIER 
FIRST CLASS BUT TRAIN OPERATORS 
FEEL DIFFERENTLY 
IF YOU WANT TO 
AVOID FINES OR PENALTY FINES DON'T 
GO INTO FIRST CLASS WITH A STANDARD 
CLASS TICKET 
IN THE MEANTIME THOSE 
WHO MOVE INTO FIRST CLASS WITHOUT 
THE RIGHT TICKET DO SO AT THEIR 
PERIL NICHOLA MYHILL IS WAITING TO 
FIND OUT IF AND WHEN SHE GETS HER 
MONEY BACK SHE MADE TWO COMPLAINTS 
THE SECOND APPEAL WHICH WOULD HAVE 
BEEN SCARED OUT SHOULD HAVE COME 
BACK WITH AN ANSWER TODAY AT OF 
YET SHE HAS HEARD NOTHING THIS 
COULD GO ON FORM SOME TIME 
THE NUMBERS OF THESE CHINESE 
MITTEN CRABS HAVE BEEN GROWING 
RAPIDLY IN THE THAMES AND THERE ARE 
WARNINGS THEY ARE DESTROYING THE 
RIVER'S NATURAL HABITAT THEY 
ARRIVED ON SHIPS FROM ASIA DECADES 
AGO NOW THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM 
SAYS ONE WAY THEY COULD BE 
CONTROLLED IS BY FISHING THEM AND 
SHIPPING THEM BACK TO AS GENTLEMAN 
WHERE THEY ARE A DHAL CASSY THIS 
IS THE SAINT CLEMENT'S AREA OF THE 
THAMES ESTUARY AN ICE LATE PLACE 
WHERE A DWINDLING NUMBER OF 
FISHERMEN MAKE LIVING BUT IT IS 
ALSO WHERE THE NATURAL HISTORY 
MUSEUM IS RESEARCHING AN UNDERWATER 
INVASION THESE DAYS NETS ARE FULL 
OF HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CHINESE 
MITTEN CRABS 
THEY ARE JUST EATING 
THEIR WAY THROUGH THE SEDIMENT 
PRESUMABLY THAT'S DAMAGING FOR 
INDIGENOUS SPECIES 
YES THEY WILL 
BE EATING FISH EGGS EATING SNAILS 
ANYTHING THEY CAN GET THEIR SKHRAUS 
ON SO TO SPEAK 
THE CRABS HAVE NO 
PREDATORS HERE AND IT IS BELIEVED 
THEY CAME OVER FROM CHINA IN THE 
BALLAST TANKS OF SHIPS THE CRAB 
GETS ITS NAME BECAUSE OF THE 
MITTENS IT HAS ON ITS CLAWS THE 
RESEARCHERS FROM THE NATURAL HIRST 
MUSEUM THINK THERE COULD BE 
MILLIONS OF THEM IN THE THAMES ONE 
SOLUTION BEING PROPOSED BY THE 
MUSEUM IS TO ALLOW THESE CRABS TO 
BE FISHED THEY ARE A CHINESE 
DELKASY DAVE PIERCE HAS FISHED 
HERE FOR EIGHTEEN Y. I. E. R. S. THE CRABS ARE A 
MENACE AND RUIN HIS NETS BUT THEY 
COULD BE A NICE BUSINESS 
BE I 
DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A NICE 
BUSINESS JUST CATCHING CRABS CAN I 
CATCH EELS AS WELL AS SOON AS THEY 
SAY YES I'VE GOT PEOPLE WANT TO GO 
BUY THEM 
THE CRABS ARE BEING 
TESTED TO SEE IF THEY CAN BE EATEN 
IF THE CRAB WAS TO PASS WE COULD 
THEN PERHAPS TAKE THE NEXT STEPH 
AND SEE IF WE COULD FISH IF IT 
FAILS THERE WOULD BE NO FISHING AND 
WE WOULD HAVE TO THINK OF ANOTHER 
WAY OF DEPLETING THE POPULATION 
UNTIL THOSE RESULTS THIS 
UNDERWATER INVASION WILL MARCH ON 
UNSEEN AND UNCHECKED 
STILL TO COME CAN YOU SEE IT THE 
LONDONERS OUT EARLY THIS MORNING TO 
HEAR AND SEE THE DAWN CHORUS 
FOOTBALL NOW CAN CHELSEA BECOME 
THE FIRST LONDON CLUB TO LIFT THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TROPHY THREE WEEKS 
THEY TAKE ON MANCHESTER UNITED IN 
MOSCOW OF A 
SEMI FINAL WIN LAST WHAT DID YOU 
MAKE OF THE GAME LAST NIGHT 
IT WAS 
FANTASTIC MANY CONGRATULATIONS TO 
EVERYONE TO DO WITH CHELSEA 
FOOTBALL CLUB IT IS A REAL 
ACHIEVEMENT THEY'VE LOST THREE 
SEMI FINALS BEFORE SO IT MAKES IT 
FITTING THAT WITH ABRAMOVICH THEIR 
EUROPEAN HE HAS A HOUSE IN LONDON 
AND MOSCOW AND NOW THEY ARE IN THE 
FINAL FINAL 
CHELSEA HAVE MADE IT INDEED THEY HAVE MOSCOW BOUND IN 
TWENTY DAYS' TIME FOLLOWING THEIR 
DRAMATIC EXTRA TIME SEMI FINAL 
VICTORY OVER LIVERPOOL SO HOW WILL 
TENS OF THOUSAND OF CHELSEA FANS 
GET TO MOSCOW CAN ASSURE YOU IT 
WON'T BE CHEAP FLIGHTS AND 
ACCOMMODATION AT A PREMIUM IN THE 
MATCH PROGRAMME CHAE ARE OFFERING 
DAY TRIPS TO MOSCOW FOR SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY NINE BUT 
NO DETAILS ON ENTRY ADVISE ZAS TO 
GET INTO RUSSIA CHELSEA OFFICIALS 
TRAVEL TO MOSCOW TODAY TO TALK WITH 
UEFA AND THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN 
MINISTRY TO TRY TO SOLVE THAT 
HEADACHE 
WE ARE GOING TO MOSCOW HEADACHE PHIL HOW THAT FEEL 
IT WAS GOOD CHELSEA WIN 
THE DAY AFTER THE NIGHT BEFORE 
CHELSEA SUPPORTERS' GROUPS WERE 
WORRIED ABOUT THE ORDINARY FAN 
WOULD GET TO MOSCOW 
THE BEST DEAL 
I FOUND WAS ONE THOUSAND FOR TWO DAYS 
STILL EXPENSIVE 
IT'S VERY 
EXPENSIVE 
STILL EXPENSIVE IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE MOSCOW IS NOT PERHAPS 
THE BEST CHOICE TO HOLD AN EVENT 
LIKE THIS THE THING IS WITH TWO 
ENGLISH SIDES ONE WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT THAT UEFA COULD HAVE PUT IN 
A CONTIN AGAINSTY PLANS TO MOVE IT 
TO WEMBLEY THE MAJOR CONCERN IS 
GETTING THE VISAS DONE WE'VE HAD 
THE NEWS TODAY THAT THE RUSSIANS 
ARE GOING TO LET THE VISAS BE DONE 
WITHIN EIGHT DAYS BUT FOR FORTY THOUSAND 
OR FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE INCLUDING 
MANCHESTER UNITED SUPPORTERS 
PEOPLE ARE DOUBTFUL WHETHER THEY 
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF 
FLAMP SCORES FRANK LAMPARD'S MOTHER DIED LAST 
WEEK SO HIS PENALTY CHELSEA'S 
SECOND GOAL IS BEING HAILED AS 
BRAVE BUT POSSIBLY THE GOAL THAT 
FINALLY BROKE LIVERPOOL 
IT WAS TO HONOUR HIS MUM IT WAS 
THE BEST WAY TO TAKE THE PENALTY 
TO SCORE THE DECISIVE GOAL GET 
INTO THE FINAL AND I'M REALLY 
HAPPY FOR HIM THAT IT WENT THIS WAY 
HAPPY CHELSEA PLAYERS HAPPY 
SUPPORTERS IF THEY GET A TICKET 
VISA AND OF COURSE CAN AFFORD IT 
SO MARK REAL CHALLENGE FOR FANS 
IT IS 
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO DO IT 
WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING HOW TO GET 
THERE INDEPENDENTLY WE FOUND OUT 
THERE ARE NO DIRECT FLIGHTS FROM 
LONDON TO MOSCOW ON THE WEEK OF THE 
FINAL ALL OF THESE FLIGHTS WERE 
SOLD OUT WEEKS AGO 
WE HAD TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE WAYS 
THE CHEAPEST FLIGHT WE COULD FIND 
WAS FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THAT WAS VIA MILAN AS 
YOU KNOW THERE ARE TWO AIRPORTS IN 
MILAN YOU FLY INTO ONE AND FLY OUT 
OF THE OTHER THAT'S COMPLICATED 
THE MOST EXPENSIVE FLIGHT WE COULD 
FOUND WAS MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND THAT'S 
QUITE EXPENSIVE HOWEVER THE 
CHEAPEST WAY TO GET THERE IS BY 
TRAIN THIS GOES VIA LONDON TO 
BRUSSELS COLOGNE AND THEN TO 
MOSCOW THE DOWNSIDE OF THIS IT 
TAKES YOU TWO DAYS TO GET THERE 
WHAT ELSE COULD YOU DO YOU COULD 
DRIVE IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED TO 
GET INTO MOSCOW WE ESTIMATED IT 
WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED PETROL THREE HUNDRED TOLLS 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR FOR THE EUROTUNNEL MAKING IT 
A GRAND TOTAL OF EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY FOUR GETTING TO 
MOSCOW IS EXPENSIVE AND COMPLICATED 
PLUS YOU DOE NEED A VISA ONCE YOU 
GET THERE THAT MIGHT NOT BE WHERE 
YOUR TROUBLES START 
IT WILL BE 
HELL I SPEAK RUSSIAN I FIND IT 
TRICKY GETTING AROUND THIS IS A 
VAST CITY BIGGER THAN LONDON IT'S 
SPRAWLING EVERYTHING'S IN A 
STRANGE LANGUAGE ABSOLUTELY 
BAFFLING JUST GETTING ON THE METRO 
THE UNDERGROUND IS A MASSIVE 
UNDERTAKING ON TOP OF THAT I DARE 
SAY THE SECURITY FORCES WILL BE 
TAKING AN INTEREST ANY CHELSEA FAN 
WHO JUST STEPS OUT OF LINE A LITTLE 
BIT WILL BE JUMPED ON QUITE 
POSSIBLY LITERALLY 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS YES 
AWAY FROM CHELSEA HAPPENS YES WHAT ABOUT PROMOTION INTO THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE 
THERE'S NO DOUBT 
THAT THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IS WHERE 
IT'S AT THERE IS LOTS OF MONEY OF 
GETTING INTO THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
SIXTY TWO MILLION THAT IS COULD AWAIT 
WATFORD OR CRYSTAL PALACE THEY 
HAVE ONE GAME TO PLAY THEY'RE IN 
THE PLAY OFFS THEN 
CRYSTAL PALACE IS REGULATED JOHN 
FORTUNE'S HEADER HAS SENT CRYSTAL 
PALACE DOWN IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS 
SINCE CRYSTAL PALACE WERE LAST IN 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE THEY COULD BE

OF THE OLD VIC'S EDUCATION

DIRECTOR CONSIDERS A CRUCIAL PART 
OF ITS REMIT 
WE BELIEVE SO 
STRONGLY THAT ARTS AND CULTURE AND 
THEATRE CAN BE AN INCREDIBLY 
POSITIVE EXPERIENCE FOR YOUNG 
PEOPLE WE ARE THINK IT'S A WAY TO 
MAKE SURE THAT AS REGENERATION

THEATRE

I EXPLORES ENVIRONMENTAL AND 
ECONOMIC EFFECT OF CONSUMERISM AND 
IS WRITTEN BY RENOWNED PLAYWRIGHT 
SIMON BENT THE THEATRE IS A GREAT 
PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN NOT JUST 
ABOUT ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY 
ISSUES OR POLITICAL THINGS BUT 
JUST SOCIAL SKILLS INTERACTION 
AND IT GIVES PEOPLE SOMETHING TO 
AIM FOR THESE REGULAR COMMUNITY 
PROJECTS ARE WAY FOR THE OLD VIC TO 
SOURCE NEW TALENT ATTRACT A NEW 
GENERATION OF BUMS ON SEATS AND 
ENGAGE LOCALS WITH THE THEATRE 
SOMETHING APPRECIATED BY THE YOUNG 
PERFORMERS PERFORMERS THE OLD VIC IS FANTASTIC SPACE TO

MOST LONDONERS PROBABLY DON'T GET 
TO HEAR THIS WEEKEND EARLY BIRDS 
AROUND THE WORLD WILL BE GETTING UP 
AT THE CRACKDAWN TO HEAR THE 
CLASSIC SOUND OF SPRING AS PART OF 
INTERNATIONAL DAWN CHORUS DAY 
OUR REPORTER AYSHEA BUKSH WAS UP

TRANQUILLITY AND BIRD SONG

WE GO 
BIRD WATCHER DAVID HAS TAKEN 
THIS GROUP OF LOCALS FOR AN EARLY 
MORNING STROLL 
THAT IS A GREAT TIT IN THE 
BACKGROUND WARBLING IS BLACKBIRD 
THE DAWN CHORUS IS THE SOUND OF 
BIRDS DECLARING THEIR RETURN FROM 
MIGRATION TO AFRICA THEY'RE 
MARKING OUT THEIR TERRITORY 
ALTHOUGH MANY ARE STRUGGLING 
AGAINST AN INCREASING URBAN JUNGLE 
ORIGINAL COCKNEY SPARROW THAT USED 
TO BE FOUND IN THE MIDDLE OF LONDON 
IN SAINT JAMES'S PARK AND REGENT'S 
PARK ARE NOW VERY RARE PART OF THE 
REASON FOR THAT APART FROM 
POLLUTION IS PERHAPS THE FACT THAT 
WE'VE BEEN CHOPPING TOO MANY OF OUR 
HEDGE ROWS AND MAKING OUR GARDENS 
INTO PATIOS INSTEAD OF HAVING WILD 
BUSHES 
WHAT DID THESE AMATEUR BUSHES TWITCHERS HEAR 
REALLY SURPRISING 
THAT THERE SO ARE SO MANY BIRDS IT 
WAS REALLY GOOD 
YOU GET TO HEAR 
LOTS OF SINGING 
A GREAT TIT A 
BLUE TIT A RAVEN AND A CROW A A GREY TIT A CROW AND RAVEN THE THE DAWN CHORUS IS OVER NOW IT LASTED

THE LAST FEW MINUTES IT'S THE LAST 
LINE OF SHOWERS WORKING THEIR WAY 
ACROSS LONDON ONE OF THE SHOWERS 
HAS PICKED UP ENOUGH ENERGY TO TURN 
INTO A THUNDER STORM IT'S NOW 
HEADING OFF TO THE NORTH EAST OF 
LONDON UP TOWARDS ALEXANDRA PALACE 
YOU ARE LIKELY TO GET VERY WET IT 
SHOULD LOSE SOME OF ITS ENERGY THIS 
MORNING THE SHOWERS SHOULD FADE 
AWAY AS THEY ARE PUSHED AWAY FROM 
THE LONDON AREA WE WILL END UP 
WITH CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT TONIGHT 
IT WILL TURN CHILLY IN THE TOWNS 
SUBURBS AND COUNTRYSIDE THE 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE SIX OR SEVEN 
CELSIUS BUT IN RURAL LOCATIONS WE 
COULD SEE A TOUCH OF FROST ON THE 
GROUND A BIT OF MIST AS WELL FIRST 
THING TOMORROW 
A BRIGHT START TOMORROW BUT 
EVENTUALLY THE SHOWERS WILL GET 
GOING GOING THE SHOWERS WON'T BE AS HEAVY AS 
TODAY TODAY THEY WILL BE PUSHED ALONG BY A 
SOUTH TO SOUTH WESTERLY BREEZE 
BRINGING WARMER AIR A TOP 
TEMPERATURE OF SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN CELSIUS 
IT'S LIKELY TO GET WARMER THAN THAT 
OVER THE BANK HOLIDAY WEEKEND IT 
LOOKS AS THOUGH WE WILL GET THE 
BEST OF THE BLUE SKIES ON SATURDAY 
A FEW PROBLEMS FOR SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY IT'S ALL DOWN TO THAT 
WEATHER FRONT CREEPING ACROSS FROM 
THE WEST AS YOU CAN SEE HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDING BEHIND THAT 
WEATHER FRONT THAT WILL TEND TO 
SQUEEZE THE MOISTURE OUT OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE SO HOPEFULLY BY THE 
TIME THE FRONT GETS TO US THERE 
WON'T BE TOO MUCH CLOUD ON IT AND 
NOT TOO MUCH RAIN PROBABLY AS I 
SAY THE BEST OF THE DRY WEATHER ON 
SATURDAY HAZIER SUNSHINE AND SOME 
SHOWERY RAIN ON SUNDAY AND BANK 
HOLIDAY MONDAYS 
PETER YOU BETTER COME DOWN QUICKLY 
AND GET DRY
