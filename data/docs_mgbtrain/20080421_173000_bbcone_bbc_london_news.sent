FORMER RACE ADVISER LEE JASPER

THIS DANCE STUDIO BECAUSE OF WHAT 
USED TO GO ON ON THE FLOOR BE 
BELOW IT THIS IS THE GREEN BADGE 
TAXI SCHOOL THAT RECEIVED PUBLIC 
MONEY TO TRAIN BLACK PEOPLE 
INTERESTED IN BECOMING CAB DRIVERS 
NOW IT IS THE POLICE WHO ARE 
INTERESTED WITH ACCUSATIONS OF 
MONEY LAUNDERLINGING AND THE CLAIM 
THAT IT TYPIFIES CITY HALL UNDER 
KEN LIVINGSTONE 
THIS SUMS UP 
EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN GOING 
WRONG YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL 
OPERATION HELPING KIDS AND DOWN

IF THE 
POLICE AND THE BARRISTERS' INQUIRY 
CLEAR LEE JASPER KEN LIVINGSTONE 
SAYS HE WILL REINSTATE HIM 
ALTHOUGH SOME THINK AFTER THE 
TROUBLE THE AFFAIR HAS CAUSED THAT 
THAT IS NOW UNLIKELY HERE A FULL 
LIST OF THE CANDIDATES STANDING 
AND COMING UP LATER HOW CONFIDENT 
IS HE FEELING WE'LL ASK THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER ABOUT BRIAN 
PADDICK'S MAYORAL CHANCES PLUS TWO 
DECADES AFTER THE RIOTS WE MEET 
THE BROADWATER FARM FOOTBALLERS 
AIMING FOR THE TOP 
THE REGENERATION OF EAST LONDON WAS 
ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF THE 
CAPITAL'S BID FOR THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE GAMES 
BUT NOW A NEW STUDY CLAIMS THE 
LEGACY OF THE OLYMPICS WON'T HAVE 
THE LASTING IMPACT FOR THE LOCAL 
COMMUNITY THAT WAS PROMISED WE CAN 
CROSS LIVE TO ADRIAN WARNER FOR 
MORE DETAILS L. HAVE BEEN LOOK 
AROUND THE OLYMPIC PARK IT IS A 
SITE AS BIG AS THE ST CITY OF 
LONDON BUT THE MAIN CONCERN IN 
THIS REPORT IS THAT THE WHOLE OF 
THE AREA MAY BECOME BECOME 
YUPPIFIID AND DEVELOPERS WILL ONLY 
BUILD LUXURY FLATS THIS IS ONE OF 
THE POOREST PARTS OF LONDON AND THE 
LOCALS WON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO 
LIVE HERE T. AUTHORS OF THE REPORT 
HAVE COME UP WITH AN INTERESTING 
SOLUTION TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THIS 
DOES NOT HAPPEN 
PART OF THE LEGACY 
OF THE GAMES SHOULD BE AT LEAST 
SOME OF THE OLYMPIC LAND WHICH IS 
A HUGE SPACE SHOULD BE HELD IN 
TRUST FOR LOCALS AT THE MOMENT 
THERE IS A DANGER THAT ALL OF THE 
LAND MOST OF THE LAND WILL BE 
SOLD TO PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPERS 
TO MEET THE DEBTS THAT HAVE BEEN 
CREATED 
REMEMBER THE LONDON CREATED DEVELOPMENT AGENCY HAS TO SELL OFF 
A BIT OF THE LAND AFTER THE GAMES 
TO HELP PAY FOR THAT NINE BILLION 
BILL THEY HOPE TO MAKE UP TO TWO 
BILLION AND THEY HAVE TOLD US THAT 
THEY DESPITE THIS THEY WILL TRY TO 
MAKE SURE THE LOCAL COMMUNITY DOES 
BENEFIT 
WE ARE CONSCIOUS VERY BENEFIT ALIVE TO THE THREAT OF LOCALS BEING 
PRICED OUT OF THE MARKET THAT IS 
WHY WE HAVE ANNOUNCED A FIFTY PER CENT 
AFFORDIBILITIES TARGET FOR THE 
HOUSING THAT WILL BE BUILT FOR THE 
GAMES AND BEYOND THE GAMES 
ONE OF 
THE WAYS THAT THERE IS MASSIVE 
TRANSFORPATION IS IN THE WATER WAYS 
OUR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT TOM 
EDWARTDS HAS BEEN EDWARDS HAS 
BEEN LOOKING AT THE CHANGES THESE 
ARE THE OLYMPIC'S HIDDEN WATER WAYS 
FOR DECADES UNUSED NOW THEY COULD 
HELP THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS PROVE ITS 
GREEN CREDENTIALS THE AUTHORITY 
WANTS LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO BE THE 
GREENEST GAMES AND THEY WANT FIFTY PER CENT OF 
ALL THE MATERIALS TO BE DELIVERED 
SUSTAINABLY USING RAIL AND WATER 
SIXTY YEARS AGO TWO MILLION TONNES OF 
FREIGHT CAME ALONG HERE IT IS 
HOPED A SIMILAR AMOUNT OF 
CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL WILL ALSO BE 
SHIPPED BY WATER THAT WILL TAKE 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND TRUCKS OFF THE ROADS THIS THIS IS THE HEART OF WHAT WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT SUSTAINABLE LEGACY IF WE 
CAN'T DO IT HERE NEXT TO THE THAMES 
WITH THE OLYMPICS NEXT TO THE WATER 
WAYS WHERE ELSE CAN WE DO IT THE THE PROBLEM IS THE RIVER LEA IS TIDAL 
TO SOLVE THAT ENGINEERS ARE 
BUILDING A HUGE LOCK THE FIRST FOR 
NINETEEN YEARS THAT WILL CREATE SEVEN 
KILOMETRES OF RIVERS AND STOP 
SEWAGE FROM OVERFLOWS 
IT WILL 
ENABLE US TO MANAGE THE WATER FLOW 
IT WILL DEAL WITH SOME OF THE 
PROBLEMS THERE HAVE BEEN WITH 
SEWAGE AND ALLOW MATERIALS TO COME 
IN AND OUT AND IT IS AN INVESTMENT 
THE PROJECT IS DUE TO BE COMPLETED 
LATER THIS YEAR AND ONCE THE GAMES 
HAVE BEEN GONE IT IS HOPED THE 
WATER WAYS WILL BE PART OF A 
LASTING LEGACY SO THIS REPORT AND 
ANOTHER ONE DUE TOMORROW WHICH 
COULD BE MORE CRITICAL 
YES THE 
M. P.'S ARE WILL PRODUCE ANOTHER REPORT 
CRITICISING THE SIZE OF THE NINE 
BILLION BUDGET BUT THE REAL 
QUESTION IS THEY ARE CHANGING THE 
LANDSCAPE BUT ARE THEY GOING TO 
CHANGE LIVES HERE AS DRAMATICALLY 
THANK YOU TWO NEW SUSPECTS HAVE 
BEEN ARRESTED IN CONNECT SWHUN THE 
MURDER OF PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR TWENTY ONE 
YEARS AGO DANNY MORGAN'S DEATH IS 
A NOTORIOUS UNSOLVED CASE GUY

US YES IT IS NOT JUST TUBE DRIVERS 
WHO ARE HERE PERSUADING PEOPLE THIS 
COMEDY NOISE LAUGHING MATTER THE T. 
SAMARITANS CHARITY HAS HAS

FEELS IS HIS DREEM DREAMS MAY COME 
TRUE SO HE LOOKS FOR A VICTIM I I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD BE 
INTERESTED IN THROWING YOURSELF IN

THE PROBLEM WITH 
THIS BLACK COMEDY IS TRAIN DRIVERS 
DOING THE JOB IN IN DAY OUT WHO 
HAVE EXPERIENCED THE TRAUMA OF 
SUICIDE OR DEATH DON'T FIND THIS A 
LAUGHING MATTER THEY WERE OUT 
TODAY ASKING PEOPLE TO BOYCOTT THE 
FILM AS A MATTER OF RESPECT NOT 
JUST FOR THEM BUT THE FAMILIES OF 
THOSE WHO HAVE DIED 
IT PRETENDS TO 
BE A COMEDY BUT ANYBODY W. H. HAS 
SEEN OR BEEN INVOLVED IN A DEATH ON 
THE RAILWAY THERE IS NOTHING FUNNY 
ABOUT IT IT IS A TRAGIC EVENT THAT 
AFFECTS PEOPLE FOR YEARS THERES NO 
SUCH THING A AS A THREE AND OUT 
RULE DRIVERS DON'T GET PAY OUTS 
PEOPLE SPEND YEARS BEING 
TRAUMATISED

FILM MAKERS SAY THE ISSUE IS 
SENSITIVELY HAND LDZ HANDLED 
MACKENZIE CROOK IS THE STAR OF THE 
FILM VERY WELL HAVE ARE YOU PROUD 
OF IT YES 
HAD YOU ANY IDEA HOW YES CONTROVERSIAL IT WOULD BE 
TO BE 
HONEST I DIDN'T L. REALISE IT DEALT 
WITH SENSITIVE ISSUES BUT IT DOES 
NOT DWELL UPON THEM IT IS NOT 
ABOUT THOSE SORTS OF ISSUES NOT 
ABOUT PEOPLE JUMPING UNDER TRAINS 
WHICH WOULDN'T WANT TO BE A PART OF 
THAT IS PART OF THE SET UP BUT IT 
IS A ROAD MOVIE ABOUT HUMAN 
EMOTIONS AND IT IS NOT BAD TASTE 
MOVIE 
YOU GOT INTO THE MIND SET OF MOVIE A BEING A DRIVER 
YES I GOT TO 
DRIVE A TRAIN THAT BECAUSE THRILL 
YOU MUST HAVE GOT SOME SOFT SIMP 
THINK THEY AREN'T SAYING DON'T 
WATCH THE FILL BUT KEEP AN OPEN

AND THE THREE AND OUT RULE IT IS 
ALL FICTIONAL 
THANK YOU THE FILM 
OPENS ON FRIDAY SO YOU CAN CAN SEE 
FOR YOURSELF IF YOU HIT THE IS 
TASTELESS OR FUNNY OR MAYBE BOTH 
STILL TO COME 
ASPIRING FASHION DESIGNERS AND 
MODELS GET VALUABLE EXPOSURE HERE 
AT ALTERNATIVE FASHION WEEK MORE 
ON THE MAYORAL ELECTIONS AND WITH 
JUST LESS THAN TWO WEEKS TO GO AND 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT M. P. BRIAN 
PADDOCK APPEARS TO BE SLIPPING IN 
THE POLLS IN A MOMENT WE'LL GET 
THE THOUGHTS OF HIS PARTY LEADER 
NICK CLEGG BUT FIRST A SNAP SHOT OF 
MR. PADDOCK'S CAMPAIGN SO FAR IT IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A BEACON 
FOR THE REST OF LONDON 
ON THE 
CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN CROYDON BRIAN 
PADDOCK A SOUTH LONDONER A FORMER 
TOP COP OPENLY GAY AND PROUD NOT 
TO BE A POLITICIAN 
I THINK PEOPLE 
ARE FED UP WITH CAREER POLITICIANS 
PEOPLE ARE AMAZED AT MY PERFORMANCE 
JUST TWO YEARS AGO BRIAN PADDOCK 
OFFICIALLY JOINED THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRAT PARTY HE RETURNED TO THE 
STREETS OF LONDON WHEN HIS PARTY 
LEADER WITH HIS PARTY LEADER BY 
HIS SIDE TO LAUNCH THAIS MAYORAL 
CAMPAIGN HIS BIG POLICY PROMISE 
TO CUT CRIME BY TWENTY PER CENT SINCE DAY ONE 
OF THE CAMPAIGN BRIAN PADDOCK HAS 
SHARED THE STAGE WITH THE TWO MAIN 
CANDIDATES CANDIDATES HE CALLED BORE JOHNSON A CLOWN AND 
KEN LIVINGSTONE A TRAGEDY BUT WITH 
LESS THAN TWO WEEKS TO GO HE'S 
STILL NOT PLAYING A LEAD ROLE WITH 
LESS THAN NINE PER CENT IN THE POLLS WHAT IS 
PUTTING VOTERS OFF 
PEOPLE HAVE 
SAID TO ME IT'S UNFORTUNATE YOU'RE 
VOTING FOR THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
THEY NEVER VOTE FOR THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS I CAN'T HELP IT SOME 
PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE FACT 
THAT I'M GUY SOME WITH THE FACT 
THAT I'M A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT THAT'S 
WHO I AM 
WITH ME IS THE DEMOCRAT 
LEADER NICK CLEGG SO IT'S ALL 
YOUR FAULT REALLY IT WASN'T A 
RINGING ENDORSEMENTS OF THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS FRPBLGTSZ I THINK WHAT 
IT HAS BEEN A RINGING ENDORSEMENT 
HAS BEEN THE FIFTEEN LOCAL BY ELECTION S. 
IN THE LONDON AREA SINCE BRIAN 
BECAME OUR CANDIDATE WHERE THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HAVE GOT A LARGER 
SHARE OF THE VOTE THAN EITHER 
LABOUR OR CONSERVATIVES AT PARTY 
SO THAT'S A GOOD SAMPLE OF PUBLIC 
OPINION TOWARDS THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS AND BRIAN 
THE POLLS ARE 
SUGGESTING THAT HE'S GONE DOWN 
FROM TWELVE PER CENT TO NINE PER CENT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU 
WOULD BE HOPING FOR AT THIS STAGE 
OF THE CAMPAIGN WITH TWO WEEKS TO 
GO 
I THINK THE POLLS ARE SWINGING GO AROUND QUITE A LOT THE MOST 
IMPORTANT POLL IS THE ELECTION 
ITSELF I THINK WHEN PEOPLE GET 
INTO THE BALLOT BOX THEY'LL THINK 
DO WE WANT THIS BORIS JOHNSON 
CHARACTER A BIT OF A BUEFOON 
COLOURFUL DO WE WANT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE AND THE WAY HE HAS RUN 
CITY HALL OR DO WE WANT BRIAN 
PADDOCK WHO HAS SPENT THIRTY YEARS 
DOING REALLY GOOD THINGS FOR 
LONDONERS I THINK THAT'S A LOT OF 
THINGS PEOPLE WILL FIND ATTRACTIVE 
ON ELECTION DAY 
DO YOU THINK 
PEOPLE WILL FIND HIM AS ONE TRICK 
PONY CRIME IS THE ONLY THING HE 
HAS BEEN TESTED ON 
TOMORROW HE'LL 
TALK ABOUT PLANS FOR AN ACROSS 
LONDON TRAM SYSTEM HE HAS BEEN 
OUTSPOKEN ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO 
BRING OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND DISUSED HOMES IN 
LONDON INTO USE HE HAS TALKED 
ABOUT HIS PLANS TO PROTECT GREEN 
SPACES I CERTAINLY DOI DON'T THINK 
HE'S A ONE TRICK PONY 
THERE HE IS 
SHARING THE STAGE AND PLATFORM WITH 
TWO OTHER HIGH PROFILE CANDIDATES 
BORIS JOHNSON AND KEN LIVINGSTONE 
AND STILL NOT MAKING ANY INROADS 
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK IS GOING WRONG I I THINK HE IS MAKING INROADS I JON 
MENDELSOHN WINELY DON'T ACCEPT THAT 
PREMISE 
YOU DON'T BELIEVE WHAT THE PREMISE POLLS ARE SUGGESTING AT ALL 
IF ANY 
POLITICIAN STARTED TAKING ONE SNAP 
SHOT POLL AFTER ANOTHER SERIOUSLY 
THEY'D GO MAD WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS 
THE CAMPAIGN WHAT I HEAR WHEN 
CAMPAIGNING WITH BRIAN IS A 
RECOGNITION THAT BRIAN UNIQUELY 
AMONG THE CANDIDATES KNOWS HOW 
LONDON WORKS WHEN HE SAYS HE'LL 
REDUCE CRIME FIVE PER CENT EVERY YEAR HE IS 
MAYOR HE MEANS IT 
DO YOU THINK 
AS PARTY LEADER YOU TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY HAVE YOU GIVEN HIM 
ENOUGH SUPPORT YOUR M. P.'S HAVE NOT 
BEEN CLAMBERING TO BE OUT ON THE 
STREETS CAMPAIGNING THAT'S THAT'S NONSENSE I'VE BEEN OUT WITH HIM 
SEVERAL TIMES WITH HIM L. WILL BE 
OUT SEVERAL TIMES MORE WITH HIM ON 
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL OF COURSE 
NATIONALLY THE BUCK STOPS WITH ME 
BUT THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT THIS 
MAYORAL ELECTION IS THAT IT'S 
FOUGHT FOR ON LOCAL ISSUES WITH 
THREE STRONG PERSONALITIES WHEN 
PEOPLE ASK WHO IS BEST FOR LONDON 
IT'S A SERIOUS BUSINESS RUNNING 
LONDON THEY'LL COME UP THUMBS UP 
FOR BRIAN 
YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR YOU 
WANT PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR BRIAN 
PADDOCK FIRST 
THAT'S NOT A 
SURPRISE 
WHO DO YOU THINK PEOPLE SURPRISE SHOULD GIVE THEIR SECOND PREFERENCE 
VOTE 
TO WHOEVER THEY THINK THEY VOTE SHOULD I'M NOTE GOING TO DICTATE 
THAT TO PEOPLE 
BRIAN PADDOCK 
ADMITTED YESTERDAY HE WOULDN'T GIVE 
HIS SECOND PREFERENCE TO BORIS 
JOHNSON OR KEN LIVINGSTONE DO YOU 
THINK LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE WASTING 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEND OUT A 
MESSAGE TO LIBERAL DEMOCRAT VOTERS 
NO I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT THINK 
IT'S CYNICAL TO SUGGEST YOU YOU SAY CYNICAL SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY 
TACTICAL 
CYNICAL OR TACTICAL TAKE TACTICAL YOUR CHOICE IN THIS INSTANCE GIVEN 
THAT LONDON VERSE A CHOICE OF 
MAKING A FIRST AND SECOND 
PREFERENCE THEY SHOULD DO IT 
ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN PREFERENCES 
ARE YOU CONFIDENT HE CAN WIN 
I AM 
CONFIDENT THAT HE CAN PULL OFF A 
DRAMATIC SURPRISE ON POLLING DAY 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

CONSERVATIVE LEADER DAVID CAMERON

INTERESTING TWENTY NINE YEARS WE'VE GONE 
FROM ZERO TO HERO 
IT'S BEEN OVER 
TWO DECADES SINCE THE RIOTS THAT 
CULMINATED IN THE DEATH OF P. C. KEITH 
BLAKELOCK NOW THE ESTATE LOOKS 
DIFFERENT THIS TIME DISTURBING THE 
PEACE COMES FROM THE THE FOOTBALL

STILL PLAY FOOTBALL WHEN I'M REALLY 
OLD I LOVE FOOTBALL IT'S 
EVERYTHING TO ME 
THE FOOTBALL TEAM 
HAS GIVEN THE BROADWATER FARM 
COMMUNITY SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF 
THANKFULLY THE LURE OF FOOTBALL IS 
GREATER THAN GANGS AND GUNS WHAT WHAT THEY'VE LEARNT HERE HAS GIVEN THEM 
THE DISCIPLINE TO GO BACK INTO THE 
COMMUNITY AND PARTICIPATE IN ANY 
ACTIVITY WHETHER SPORT OR ACADEMIC 
THE CHANCE TO COMPETE ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL STAGE IN TOKYO IS 
THANKS TO THE FORMER CHELSEA PLAYER 
MICKEY AMBROSE

LONDON FASHION WEEK IS ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST DATES IN THE GLOBAL STYLE 
CALENDAR BUT ONLY A SELECT FEW 
DESIGNERS GET A CHANCE TO SHOW HOW 
ELSE CAN THE CAPITAL'S UP AND 
COMING TALENT GET THEIR BIG BREAK 
MID MORNING IN SPITALFIELDS DOZENS 
OF ASPIRING MODELS LINE UP HOPING 
TO BE CHOSEN FOR ALTERNATIVE 
FASHION WEEK THE ANNUAL EVENT 
SUPPORTING BUDDING DESIGNERS IT 
MAY NOT HAVE THE KUDOS OF LONDON 
FASHION WEEK BUT ORGANISERS BELIEVE 
IT SERVES A UNIQUE PURPOSE APART APART FROM BEING INCREDIBLY INCLUSIVE AND 
ACCESSIBLE YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK 
AT OUR CAT WALKS TO SEE THE MODELS 
THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT TO THE ONES 
YOU GET AT LONDON FASHION WEEK 
ALSO THE IDEAS WHEN WE'RE LOOKING 
FOR DESIGNERS TO SHOW WE'RE LOOKING 
FOR IDEAS THEY MAY NOT BE FULLY 
FORMED YET YOU MAY SEE THAT ON THE 
CATWALK BUT THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS 
IDEA ABOUT THE USE OF TEXTILES AND 
FABRICS FABRICS THEIR WORK WILL GROW 
PRODUCING A 
CATWALK SHOW CAN COST THOUSANDS 
THIS EVENT ALLOWS UP TO THIRTEEN 
DESIGNERS AND THE COLLEGE TO DAILY 
HAVE THEIR THREE MINUTES OF FAME 
FOR FREE 
AMONGST THE VISITORS AT TODAY'S 
FIRST SHOW WAS A DESIGNER WHO WON 
THE REALITY T. V. COMPETITION WHO HAS 
PREVIOUSLY SHOWN AT ALTERNATIVE 
FASHION WEEK SEVERAL TIMES THE THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS REALLY 
VALUABLE I'VE LEARNT HOW TO 
PRODUCE A COLLECTION AND I'VE 
LEARNT HOW TO MARKET MYSELF THE 
WHOLE THING IS A LEARNING STEP FOR 
ME ME IT'S NOT JUST DESIGNERS AND MODELS 
WHO MARK ALTERNATIVE FASHION WEEK 
IN THEIR DIARIES WORKING FOR 
ITALIAN MAGAZINES MEANS THIS 
DESIG NER IS LOOKING FOR INSPIRATION 
I BELIEVE THEY MAKE SOME OF THE 
BEST GARMENTS TO DATE BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE THIS SORT OF DETERMINATION TO 
STAND OUT AND GET PRESS COVERAGE 
SO THEY GO FULL OUT SO I HAVE TO 
BE HERE 
EACH SHOW IS ACCOMPANIED 
BY A LIVE BAND AND PROFILES 
DIFFERENT DESIGNERS DAILY AND CAN 
AT TIMES LIVE UP TO ITS REPUTATION 
AS ALTERNATIVE 
TIME FOR THE WEATHER HERE IS 
DANIEL 
DANIEL DANIEL IT WAS THE LEFTOVERS OF LOW 
PRESSURE THAT MADE CLOUDY 
DAMPISH START TO THE DAY THINGS 
ARE LOOKING BETTER OVER THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF DAYS WE MIGHT EVEN BE 
DUSTING OFF FEW PICNIC BASKETS 
THROUGH THE NIGHT IT'S A DRY AND 
MILD NIGHT 
NO PROBLEMS OF FROST WE STILL HAVE 
SOME LEFTOVER CLOUD BUT I THINK FOR 
THE MOST PART LOOKING GOOD THIS 
CLOUD BROUGHT US THE WET WEATHER 
AT LEAST GETTING A BIT OF 
BRIGHTNESS HERE AND THERE BUT ALL 
THIS CLOUD WILL EASE AWAY AS YOU GO 
FURTHER INTO THE COURSE OF THE 
NIGHT NOT LOOKING TOO BAD THROUGH 
THE EVENING HOURS JUST A LITTLE 
BIT OF PATCHY CLOUD AND 
TEMPERATURES FOR THE MOST PART 
WE'VE SEEN NUMBERS UP TO FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN 
BY THE END OF THE NIGHT NO LOWER 
THAN SEVEN OR EIGHT AT LEAST FOR 
THE NIGHT NOT TOO CHILLY TUESDAY 
IS A FINE LOOKING DAY ENJOY SOME 
FAIRLY PLEASANT BRIGHT OR SUNNY 
SPELLS AND THROUGH THE AFTERNOON 
SEVENTEEN IN TOWN MAYBE THE ODD EIGHTEEN THE 
NUMBERS OUTSIDE OF TOWN FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN 
ABOVE WHERE WE SHOULD BE FOR THIS 
TIME OF YEAR WE GO THROUGH THE 
NIGHT LOOKING FINE BUT THEN WE SEE 
CHANGE A CLOUD WORKS IN AND THEN 
WET WEATHER COMING IN FOR WEDNESDAY 
AND THE NUMBERS BEFORE IT COMES IN 
FIVE TO SEVEN OR EIGHT WE PUSH THE 
WET WEATHER THROUGH SO WEDNESDAY 
IS THE WET DAY BUT THEN LOOK AT 
THURSDAY LOOK FINE AGAIN BACK 
TO THE SUNSHINE AND TEMPERATURES 
DOING WELL FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN 
THAT'S THE WEATHER FOR NOW 
TONIGHT'S MAIN HEADLINES 
THE ROW OVER THE SCRAPPING OF THE 
TEN P. INCOME TAX BAND HAS PROMPTED 
THE GOVERNMENT TO LOOK AT FURTHER 
HELP FOR POORER FAMILIES IN THE 
FUTURE BORIS JOHNSON HAS ATTACKED 
KEN LIVINGSTONE WITH ALLEGATIONS OF 
CRONYISM AT CITY HALL 
THAT'S ALL FROM US FOR NOW I'LL BE 
BACK WITH THE LATEST AT ONE THOUSAND HERE 
ON B. B. C. ONE 
ENJOY YOUR EVENING
