STEPHEN HADLEY IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN HE'S BEEN 
MISSING SINCE SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX THESE 
C. C. T. V. PICTURES SHOW HIM THAT 
MORNING IN SUPERMARKET 
HIS DISAPPEARANCE HAS TRIGGERED A 
MAJOR POLICE INVESTIGATION THAT HAS 
SPREAD ACROSS THE U. K. 
STEPHEN ONE FROM THE BUSY TOWN OF 
WALSALL IN THE WEST MIDLANDS 
HE WAS A VERY KIND AND GENTLE CHILD 
VERY LOVING HE WAS A HAPPY GO 
LUCKY KID 
STEPHEN HAS ALWAYS HAD LOT OF FRIENDS FRIENDS I FIRST MET SAINT AT SENIOR SCHOOL IN 
NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE USED TO LIVE TWO HUNDRED YARDS UP 
THE ROAD SO IT WAS LIKE WALK TO 
STEVE'S AND WE'D WALK INTO TOWN AND 
DO WHAT KIDS DO BUT IT WAS ALL 
ABOUT LAUGHING WALKING AND 
CHEEKING EACH OTHER AND THAT WAS IT 
REALLY MATES FOR LIFE 
AS HE GOT 
OLDER HIS HOBBIES WERE MUSIC AND 
GUITARS HE ABSOLUTELY ADORED 
GUITARS AND HE PUT A GUITAR ON 
WHEN HE WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN AND NEVER TOOK 
IT OFF

NICHE IN MUSIC THE GUITAR WAS 
EVERYTHING TO HIM AND FOR A SELF 
TAUGHT KID HE WAS REALLY GOOD 
STEPHEN LEAVES SCHOOL AT SIXTEEN AND TWO 
YEARS LATER MOVES TO DEVON 
HE TAKES FIVE JOB AT A LOCAL PUB THAT 
HAS REGULAR LIVE MUSIC IT IS A 
GREAT PLACE FOR HIM SURROUNDED BY 
LOTS OF MUSICIANS 
HE WAS SOMEONE I MET THROUGH MUSIC 
AND GAINED A FRIENDSHIP WITH HIM 
THROUGH USING HIM AS A MUSICIAN IN 
THE BAND HE WAS RESPECTED AS A 
MUSICIAN AND HE WAS WELL KNOWN 
AMONGST EVERYBODY SO HE WAS A 
GOOD LAD 
STEPHEN'S REALLY HAPPY IN DEVON 
BUT IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THINGS START TO CHANGE 
AND HE HAS SOME BAD LUCK 
HE LOSES HIS JOB BREAKS UP WITH 
HIS GIRLFRIEND AND HAS TO MOVE OUT 
OF HIS FLAT 
AFTER HE LOST HIS JOB AND FLAT AND 
EVERYTHING HAPPENED HE WENT 
DOWNHILL PRETTY QUICK HE WENT 
REALLY QUIET HE SAID HE COULDN'T 
SLEEP HE COULDN'T EAT COULDN'T 
YOU KNOW THINK STRAIGHT 
STEPHEN DECIDES IT IS TIME FOR A 
CHANGE IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND SIX HE LEAVES 
DEVON AND MOVES BACK TO THE WEST 
MIDLANDS MIDLANDS FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS HE 
WAS BACK IT WAS A LOT OF DRINKING 
AND SEEING OLD PEOPLE HE HADN'T 
SEEN FOR A WHILE AND GOING TO A 
GOOD FEW PARTIES 
ALTHOUGH HE GETS BACK IN TOUCH WITH 
HIS OLD FRIENDS HE'S NOT HIMSELF 
HIS MUM REMEMBERS ONE OF THEIR 
PHONE CONVERSATIONS IN LATE SUMMER 
TWO THOUSAND SIX TWO THOUSAND SIX I SPOKE TO HIM FOR ABOUT AN HOUR 
AND A HALF AND WE HAD A REALLY 
LONG CHAT AND HE WAS SAYING HOW 
DOWN HE WAS AND HOW DIFFICULT HE 
WAS FINDING THINGS 
IT'S NINETEENTH 
SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX AND STEPHEN GOES TO 
THE PUB IN WALSALL WITH HIS MATES 
HE WAS MUTE ON THAT NIGHT TO THE 
POINT WHERE SOMEONE ACTUALLY SAID 
TO HIM YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN ALL 
NIGHT LAD AND HE JUST SAT THERE 
SMILED AND NOD AND HE OBVIOUSLY HAD 
SOMETHING ON HIS MIND THAT HE 
DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE WITH ANYBODY 
THE NEXT MORNING MOST OF STEPHEN'S 
FLATMATES HEAD OUT TO WORK WHILST 
HE SLEEPS IN 
GAZ OUR MATE WAS AT HOME HE WORKS 
FROM HOME AND I THINK STEPHEN GOT 
UP AROUND TEN A M. AND GAZ WAS 
UPSTAIRS WORKING AND STEVE STROLLED

LATER ON MISSING LIVE WHAT CAN 
C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE REVEAL ABOUT STEPHEN'S

MOBILE CHARGES MAY VARY THERE ARE 
LOTS OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE GO

THEM LATER WE'LL BRING YOU THE 
CASE OF GYM DOWSETT AND ALZHEIMER'S 
WAS ONE OF THEM MEANWHILE LYNDA 
JOINS US TO TELL US ABOUT HER MUM 
AND DAD TALKING ABOUT YOUR MUM 
FIRST WHEN DID YOU FIRST REALISE 
THAT SOMETHING WAS UP 
YES THE 
THING ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S IS WHEN THE 
ONSET IS COMING IT CAN BE SLOW OR 
IT CAN BE FAST AND THEN SLOW SO 
WITH MY MUM SHE SEEMED A BIT 
STRANGE AND ELDERLY BUT HE WANT 
THAT OLD SHE WAS IN HER SEVENTIES AND I 
REMEMBER CLEARLY ONE DAY SHE ASKED 
HOW TO USE THE WASHING MACHINE AND 
WE KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG AND 
THE BIGGEST THING TO KEEP HER SAFE 
IS FOR HER NOT TO USE THE CAR BUT 
THEN YOU FIND SHE HAS TAKEN THE 
KEYS AND THE CAR SO WE HAD TO HIDE 
THE KEYS AND MY MUM ALSO HAD BAD 
HIPS SO SHE BECAME BED RIDDEN SO 
THAT PROBLEM WAS NO LONGER THERE 
BUT MY DAD STARTED TO DEVELOP 
DEMENTIA AND IF YOU SEE SOMEONE 
ELDERLY AND DISORIENTATED THEY 
ARE NOT AXE MURDERERS MENTAL 
HEALTH HAS VARYING DEGREES AND 
ALZHEIMER'S IS NOT ABOUT MAD PEOPLE 
GOING TO ATTACK YOU IF YOU SEE 
SOMEBODY LOOKING LOST AND FRAIL 
JUST ASK THEM THROUGH IT SO HE 
USED TO GO TO TESCO AND HAVE 
BREAKFAST AND WE GOT A CALL FROM 
SOMEBODY SAYING HE WASN'T QUITE 
RIGHT BUT A THAT HE WAS DRIVING 
INTO PEOPLE IN THE CAR PARK AND HE 
HAD TWO BREAKFASTS HE'D HAD A 
BREAKFAST AND GONE AWAY AND 
FORGOTTEN AND CAME BACK AGAIN AND 
WE WERE LUCKY THAT SOMEBODY WAS 
KIND ENOUGH TO CALL US AND IT WAS 
HORRIBLE TO TAKE AWAY THE CAR AND 
HE THEREFORE WASN'T ALLOWED THE 
FREEPLD HE WANTED

IT WAS ODD SHE HAD NOT TURNED UP 
ABOUT NINE A M. IT WAS ODD THAT SHE WAS 
NOT AT WORK SO I RANG HER HOME AND 
GOT HER SON AND HE SAID NO SHE'S 
AT WORK SO I ASKED TO SPEAK TO HIS 
DAD AND SPOKE TO HIM AND HE SAID 
NO HE LEFT FOR WORK AT THE FAIRLY 
NORMAL TIME AND SHE MAY HAVE 
BROKEN DOWN SO I ASKED HER HUSBAND 
TO DRIVE ALONG THE SEAFRONT ON THE 
WAY SHE WENT TO WORK AND HE PHONED 
ME BACK AND HE'D FOUND HER CAR NOT 
FAR FROM GORING TRAIN STATION

HAVE HAD PERHAPS IN HIS POCKET WAS 
TEN BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW THEY 
HAVE NEVER SAID ANY CLOTHES WENT 
WITH HIM DIDN'T TAKE A BAG AS FAR 
AS I KNOW IT WAS AS IF HE JUST 
UPPED AND WALKED OUT THE DOOR 
JIM HAS BEEN MISSING BEFORE WEEKS 
BEFORE THERE IS A SIGHTING TWENTY 
MILES FROM THE CARE HOME 
THEY HAD 
ONE ON THE LANCASTER CANAL WHICH WE 
WERE QUITE PLEASED ABOUT BECAUSE IT

HELICOPTER UP AND LOOKED BUT THEY 
DIDN'T FIND HIM 
IT IS NOW ALMOST 
THREE YEARS SINCE HE DISAPPEARED 
HIS HEALTH IS FRAGILE BUT HIS 
FAMILY STILL HAVEN'T GIVEN UP HOPE 
HE WILL BE FOUND 
IF ANYBODY THINKS 
THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN ANYTHING 
MIGHT HAVE SEEN HIM JUST GET IN 
TOUCH THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 
THE FAMILY WAITING AND IT IS HARD 
TO LIVE EVERY DAY NOT KNOWING IF IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT MIGHT 
HAVE HAPPENED TO 
JIM PLEASE CALL 
MISSING PEOPLE WE HAVE GOT OUR E. 
MAIL AT THE PROBLEM AS WELL JIM 
WENT MISSING BECAUSE OF ALZHEIMER'S 
TWO PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE EFFECTS OF 
ALZHEIMER'S ARE HERE WITH ME LYNDA 
BELLINGHAM AND DAWN UDMUNDS WE 
KNOW YOUR HUSBAND SUFFERS FROM 
ALZHEIMER'S HE WAS REALLY ACTIVE 
WHEN DID YOU NOTICE THAT THINGS 
WERE A BIT AMISS 
HE WAS EXTREMELY 
ACTIVE ROCK CLIMBER MOUNTAINEER 
I THOUGHT HE WAS DEPRESSED AS HE 
PASSED HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY WE TOOK A 
TRIP ROUND THE WORLD A CAREER GAP 
AND BECAUSE I WAS WITH HIM TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS 
THINK PERHAPS HIS SYMPTOMS WERE 
MORE OBVIOUS TO ME THAN THEY MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN IF HE HAD BEEN GOING TO 
WORK AND COMING HOME 
WHEN HE 
STARTED TO GO WANDERING YOU HAD TO 
SET UP SYSTEMS TO FIND HIM WHAT 
DID YOU DO 
I BECAME AWARE THAT HE 
WAS BECOMING MORE AND MORE 
VULNERABLE BUT HE WANTED TO 
MAINTAIN HIS INDEPENDENCE L. 
COULDN'T LOCK HIM IN OR HE WOULD 
BREAK A WINDOW AND LEAVE SO WE 
CREATED A LITTLE IDENTITY CARD BUT 
WE HAD TO DO THAT TOGETHER SO HE 
WOULD TAKE OWNERSHIP OF IT SO HE 
WOULD ACCEPT IT AS SOMETHING HE 
WOULD CARRY AND IT HAD MY PHONE 
NUMBER ON IT WE ALSO CAR RAID 
WHISTLE BECAUSE IT WAS EASY TO 
BECOME SEPARATED IN CROWDS AND 
TOWNS SO WE WOULD PLAY WITH THIS 
WHISTLE AND HE WOULD RESPOND IF I 
WHISTLED HIM AN HE WOULD WHISTLE TO 
ME AND WE WOULD TURN IT INTO A GAME 
SO HE WOULD ACCEPT ME KEEPING TRACK 
WE KNOW YOU TOOK TO PUTTING YOUR 
CAR KEYS WHEN YOUR MUM COULDN'T 
FIND THEM THERE ARE DEVICES LIKE 
THIS ONE THAT PEOPLE CAN WEAR S. 
THAT GOOD 
I THINK IT IS A FANTASTIC IDEA YOU 
HEAR PEOPLE SAYING OH YOUR HUMAN 
RIGHTS ARE THREATENED AND IT'S A 
PRIVACY THING BUT IT IS FAR MORE 
IMPORTANT FOR THE ONE YOU LOVE TO 
FEEL HALF WAY DECENT AS HUMAN 
BEING IF YOU CAN FIND A WAY FOR 
HEM TO BE FITTED WITH SOME KIND OF 
TRACKING SYSTEM THAN IT IS THAT 
PEOPLE SHOULD THINK YOU ARE TAKING 
THEIR RIGHTS AWAY FROM THEM IT'S 
NOT LIKE A CHILD WITH THE 
SIMPLICITY OF SAYING DON'T DO 
THIS YOU'RE DEALING WITH AN ADULT 
WHO IS FIGHTING THE ILLNESS AS WELL 
THAT'S RIGHT AND IF YOU CAN 
EXPLAIN IT THEY WILL SPREERBT THAT 
THAT DEVICE IS GOING TO GIVE THEM 
THEIR INDEPENDENCE AS WELL THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR GUESTS WILL STAY 
WITH US THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
PROGRAMME SO IF YOU HAVE ANY 
QUESTIONS PLEASE GET IN TOUCH
