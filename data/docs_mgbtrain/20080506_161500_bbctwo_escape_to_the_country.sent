BUT HOW DO YOU CHOOSE YOUR DREAM HOME WHEN YOU'RE AFTER A MANAGEABLE TOWN SIZE GARDEN 
AND YOUR PARTNER FANCIES SOMETHING MUCH MORE IN KEEPING WITH A COUNTRY PAD 
WELCOME TO TWICKENHAM IN SOUTHWEST LONDON 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS AREA WAS ONCE THE EQUIVALENT OF BEVERLY HILLS 
WHEN IT WAS HOME TO THE LIKES OF CHARLES DICKENS POET ALFRED LORD TENNYSON 
AND FRANCE'S LAST KING LOUIS PHILIPPE TWO CENTURIES AGO 
AND THAT CREATIVE STREAK CONTINUES TODAY 
THIS IS THE LEGENDARY EEL PIE ISLAND 
WHERE IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES ROCK GIANTS SUCH AS THE WHO 
PINK FLOYD AND THE ROLLING STONES PERFORMED 
IN FACT MICK JAGGER AND PETE TOWNSEND 
LIKE THE PLACE SO MUCH THEY NOW LIVE JUST UP THE RIVER IN RICHMOND 
AND WITH CENTRAL LONDON JUST THIRTY MINUTES AWAY BY TRAIN 
TWICKENHAM CONTINUES TO BE A VERY AFFLUENT AND POPULAR AREA 
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IS THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A PROPERTY 
MAKING IT THE MOST EXPENSIVE BOROUGH IN OUTER LONDON 
BUT WITH THAT COMES CARS AND TRAFFIC 
THE BUSY A THREE SIXTEEN LINKING LONDON TO THE SOUTHWEST DIVIDES TWICKENHAM IN TWO 
AND WITH HEATHROW AIRPORT JUST A STONE'S THROW AWAY 
IT CAN SOMETIMES MAKE FOR A NOISY AND CONGESTED PLACE TO LIVE 
WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS TODAY'S FAMILY THE JOHNSONS WANT TO ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRYSIDE 
THIS IS HOW IT COULD BE LIKE WORKING IN A KITCHEN 
ALISTAIR AND SARAH JOHNSON AND THEIR GIRLS THREE YEAR OLD MILLIE 
AND FIVE MONTH OLD MADDIE LOVE THE OUTDOORS 
SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE NEW HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY 
MUM AND DAD ARE UNITED ON WHAT THEY'RE AFTER 
WELL ALMOST 
I'D LIKE A GARDEN THAT'S A BIT BIGGER THAN THE ONE I'VE GOT BUT NOT THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL PITCH 
THAT ALISTAIR HAS GOT BECAUSE I'LL HAVE TO DO THE GARDENING 
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT IN THE GARDEN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE 
I'D LOVE A BIG GARDEN 
WE'D LIKE TO PLAY LOTS OF FOOTBALL WOULDN'T WE 
AND WE ALSO WANT TO HAVE SOME DOGS 
YOU TELL THEM ABOUT THE DOGS 
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO CALL YOUR DOG 
SAUSAGE AND WHAT COLOUR IS HE 
BLACK AND WHITE 
A BIG DOG OR A LITTLE DOG A LITTLE DOG 
SARAH KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS TO GAIN FROM A MOVE TO THE COUNTRY 
BUT THE ONE THING SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT LOSING IS HER CIRCLE OF MUM AND TODDLER GROUPS 
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT I'M GOING TO MISS WHEN I MOVE TO THE COUNTRY 
I'VE GOT A GREAT NETWORK OF FRIENDS ROUND HERE A GREAT NETWORK OF CHILD GROUPS 
THERE'S SINGING THERE'S DANCING FOR MILLIE TO DO 
AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN I MOVE TO THE COUNTRY 
THAT I'VE STILL GOT THESE SO I REALLY DON'T WANT TO FEEL ISOLATED AND CUT OFF 
SO YES THE BALLET IS 
FOUR YEARS AGO SARAH AND ALISTAIR PAID TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND FOR THEIR HOUSE 
SINCE THEN THEY'VE SPENT FIFTY THOUSAND RENOVATING IT 
SO HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH TODAY 
I'VE CALLED IN TWO ESTATE AGENTS TO FIND OUT 
ALISTAIR AND SARAH HAVE VASTLY IMPROVED THE PROPERTY'S INTERIOR 
THE HALLWAY LEADS TO THE SITTING ROOM ON THE RIGHT 
ORIGINALLY TWO ROOMS THE JOHNSONS KNOCKED IT THROUGH 
TO CREATE AN OPEN PLAN LIVING AREA 
THE KITCHEN LEADS TO THE BACK DOOR WHICH ACCESSES THE GARDEN 
THIS HOUSE REALLY DOES HAVE 
SUPERB RECEPTION SPACE WITH A SEPARATE BREAKFAST ROOM 
AND THIS THROUGH LOUNGE I REALLY THINK 
IT WILL APPEAL TO THE MAJORITY OF BUYERS 
BACK THROUGH THE FRONT HALLWAY LEADS TO THE STAIRS 
UP ON THE FIRST FLOOR IS AN ATTRACTIVE FAMILY BATHROOM 
AND TO THE RIGHT OF THIS A DECENT SIZED BEDROOM CURRENTLY USED AS A NURSERY 
NEXT ROOM ALONG IS A SPACIOUS BEDROOM WHERE THREE YEAR OLD MILLIE SLEEPS 
THE JOHNSONS ALSO CONVERTED THEIR LOFT INTO A MASTER BEDROOM 
MAKING THIS A VERY DESIRABLE THREE STOREY PROPERTY 
THIS PROPERTY FALLS IN THE CATCHMENT FOR SOME GREAT SCHOOLS 
IT'S A REAL FAMILY HOME ESPECIALLY WITH THE ADDITION 
OF THIS LOFT CONVERSION AND GREAT EN SUITE BATHROOM 
SARAH AND ALISTAIR WE'VE HAD THIS HOUSE VALUED 
AND THE AGENTS RECKON YOU CAN EXPECT TO GET 
BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND AND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THAT'S GREAT THAT'S REALLY GOOD BETTER THAN WE THOUGHT 
SO WE NEED TO SET THE BUDGET FOR YOUR HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY SO HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE TO SPEND 
IDEALLY PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY BUT IF IT'S SOMETHING REALLY REALLY SPECIAL 
WE COULD GO ABOVE THAT WE COULD STRETCH UP TO FIVE HUNDRED 
TELL ME ALISTAIR WHERE YOU WANT TO MOVE TO I STILL WORK IN LONDON 
SO I NEED SOMETHING THAT'S COMMUTABLE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMEWHERE 
WHICH IS BETWEEN BANBURY AND BRISTOW MILTON KEYNES THAT SORT OF AREA RIGHT SO NORTH OXFORDSHIRE 
NORTH OXFORDSHIRE BUCKINGHAMSHIRE SORT OF AREA WHAT ARE THE ESSENTIAL THINGS THE HOUSE MUST HAVE 
IT'S DEFINITELY GOT TO HAVE FOUR BEDROOMS AS A MINIMUM 
IT'S GOT TO BE A PERIOD PROPERTY WITH SOME PERIOD FEATURES 
ERM BECAUSE YOU KNOW AGAIN THAT'S A STYLE WE REALLY REALLY LIKE 
ALSO WE REALLY WOULD LIKE A FAMILY ROOM 
SO WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMETHING WE COULD SEPARATE OFF FOR THE CHILDREN 
WHAT ABOUT THE ICING ON THE CAKE WE'VE GOT QUITE A BIG WINE COLLECTION 
BUT AT THE MOMENT THE WINE COLLECTION IS STORED IN THE SHED 
SO A CELLAR WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER FOR IT 
IT'D BE REALLY NICE TO HAVE A LITTLE SPACE IN THE CELLAR TO HAVE A LITTLE DARK ROOM 
WHERE I COULD DEVELOP MY OWN BLACK AND WHITE FILM 
YOU DON'T NEED ME TO TELL YOU THAT NORTH OXFORDSHIRE IS VERY POPULAR WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET AMONGST IT 
YOU JUST NEED TO KEEP LOGGED ON TO THE LAPTOP 
AND YOU CAN SEE THE PROPERTIES THAT I'M FINDING 
AND THEN I'LL JUST KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED I CAN FIND ONE THAT TICKS ENOUGH OF THE BOXES 
AND HOPEFULLY IT'LL BE YOUR DREAM HOME LOVELY THANK YOU 
THE JOHNSONS DO HAVE A GOOD BUDGET BUT NORTH OXFORDSHIRE 
IS AN EXPENSIVE AND POPULAR AREA AS IT'S COMMUTER DISTANCE TO LONDON 
SO THEY MAY NEED TO MAKE THE ODD COMPROMISE 
EVEN WITH HALF A MILLION POUNDS I'LL BE LIMITED TO WHAT I CAN FIND 
IDEALLY I'M AFTER A FOUR BED PROPERTY 
WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF LONDON 
AND BONUSES INCLUDE A WINE CELLAR 
AND DECENT FAMILY SIZED GARDEN 
NORTH OXFORDSHIRE LIES IN THE MIDDLE OF ENGLAND'S TOURIST COUNTRY 
WITH THE COTSWOLDS TO THE WEST AND SHAKESPEARE COUNTRY TO THE NORTH 
TENS OF MILLIONS OF VISITORS FLOCK HERE EVERY YEAR 
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FAR TO FIND YOUR COUNTRYSIDE IDYLL 
COS HERE IN THE CHERWELL VALLEY IS WHAT I RECKON TO BE SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SCENERY IN BRITAIN 
BACK IN THE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS THE OXFORD CANAL 
WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TRANSPORT LINKS IN THE COUNTRY 
BUT COME THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IT'S STRUGGLED TO KEEP PACE 
AND JUST LIKE AN A ROAD WAS SOON REPLACED BY ITS MOTORWAY EQUIVALENT 
IN THIS CASE THE GRAND JUNCTION CANAL 
AS A RESULT THIS AREA REMAINS LARGELY UNSPOILED 
AND STILL RETAINS MUCH OF ITS ORIGINAL CHOCOLATE BOX CHARM 
AND WITH THE ARRIVAL OF A REAL MOTORWAY THE M. FORTY IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES IT'S BOOMED 
LUCKILY MY CALLS TO LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS 
HAVE THROWN UP A COUPLE OF GREAT PROPERTIES 
THE FIRST IS JUST TWO MILES SOUTH OF BANBURY SMACK BANG IN THE MIDDLE 
OF ALISTAIR AND SARAH'S CHOSEN AREA IN THE VILLAGE OF OVERTHORPE 
FROM WHAT I CAN SEE THIS ONE ROAD OF RATHER LOVELY HOUSES 
IS THE SUM TOTAL OF OVERTHORPE SO OBVIOUSLY NO LOCAL AMENITIES HERE 
BUT JUST A MILE DOWN THE ROAD IN THAT DIRECTION 
IS MIDDLETON CHENEY A BIG VILLAGE WITH PUBS SHOPS AND TODDLER GROUPS 
SAINT BRIDES IS A GRADE TWO LISTED FOUR BEDROOM SEMI DETACHED COTTAGE 
ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WHICH IS WELL WITHIN BUDGET 
BACK HOME IN TWICKENHAM 
SARAH AND ALISTAIR ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON MY PROGRESS ON THE LAPTOP 
YEAH THAT LOOKS REALLY REALLY NICE THE WINDOWS ARE LOVELY THE THATCH LOOKS VERY NICE 
HI FIONA GOOD MORNING 
WOW GOSH POTS OF CHARACTER OUTSIDE 
IT'S A NICE ORIGINAL 
YES THATCHED CHOCOLATE BOXY KIND OF COTTAGE ISN'T IT IT IS INDEED 
THAT SORT OF NICE IMMEDIATE IMPACT WITH THE FLAGSTONE FLOORING 
AND VERY PRACTICAL AS WELL IF YOU HAVE DOGS OR CHILDREN 
THEY CLEAN VERY EASILY GOT THE CHILDREN HOPING FOR THE DOG SO THAT'S GOOD 
THIS IS THE SITTING ROOM OBVIOUSLY 
IT'S A REALLY NICE LIGHT ROOM THE DUAL ASPECT WINDOWS ARE LOVELY 
THESE HAVE GOT TO BE THE THE OPERATIONAL SHUTTERS YEAH 
VERY RARELY SEE THESE THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL 
WE CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT NO PERIOD FEATURES NO 
LET'S CARRY ON AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE REST OF IT RIGHT 
RIGHT SO BACK ACROSS THE LOVELY FLAGSTONES 
YES AND INTO THE SNUG OR FAMILY ROOM 
SARAH IS DESPERATE TO HAVE A ROOM WHERE THE CHILDREN CAN PUT ALL THEIR TOYS AND PARAPHERNALIA 
THEY CAN MAINTAIN THE SITTING ROOM AS THE LOVELY ADULT AREA 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE FOR A LITTLE FAMILY ROOM YEAH I THINK THE KIDS WOULD LOVE THAT 
I NOTICE THIS ROOM AND THE MAIN SITTING ROOM 
ARE BOTH ON THE VILLAGE STREET SO IS THIS A BUSY ROAD 
NO IT ISN'T AT ALL IT'S ACCESS ONLY FOR THE VILLAGE 
LET'S CARRY ON AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE KITCHEN 
NOW TWO VERY ENTICING DOORS THAT MUST BE THE CELLAR GIVEN WHERE THE OTHER DOOR WAS 
THIS IS THE CELLAR AND THAT IS THE STAIRCASE LEADING UPSTAIRS 
I'LL COME BACK AND EXPLORE THOSE LATER 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE KITCHEN VERY IMPORTANT ROOM FOR SARAH 
WE'VE COME ROUND IN AN L. SHAPE OF THE PROPERTY 
YES THIS IS THE EXTENSION PART BEYOND THE KITCHEN 
RIGHT IT WAS PUT ON ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO 
SO THIS IS A LONG THIN KITCHEN BUT ACTUALLY IT'S WELL FITTED 
AND IT FEELS MORE SPACIOUS THAN YOU'D IMAGINE IT MIGHT 
NOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALISTAIR TO HAVE AN INFORMAL EATING AREA 
SO THAT HE COULD SIT AND HAVE BREAKFAST WITH HIS GIRLS AND EVERYTHING 
AND THEN WE GO THROUGH TO ANOTHER EATING AREA THIS IS USED AS A FORMAL DINING AREA 
BUT OF COURSE IT COULD BE MULTI PURPOSE YOU COULD USE IT AS A STUDY A FAMILY ROOM PLAY ROOM 
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A STUDY BUT WE REALLY NEED THE DINING ROOM AS WELL FOR THE ENTERTAINING 
WHAT'S THROUGH THERE THROUGH HERE WE'VE GOT A UTILITY ROOM AND DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 
SO A GOOD AREA FOR DOGS OR WELLINGTONS 
EXCELLENT SO EFFECTIVELY WE'VE DONE THE WHOLE L. SHAPE OF DOWNSTAIRS 
NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE A LOOK DOWN IN THAT CELLAR AND THEN GO AND LOOK UPSTAIRS 
BRILLIANT 
I LOVE THESE WIDE CURVED STONE STEPS 
THEY'RE A RATHER GRAND ACCESS DOWN TO THE CELLAR AND ALSO GREAT HEAD HEIGHT 
YOU CAN REALLY PROPERLY STAND UP THERE ARE FOUR BEDROOMS IN THIS PROPERTY 
THEY ARE ARRANGED OVER TWO FLOORS SO SOME OF THEM ARE UP THERE 
WE'LL DO THIS FLOOR FIRST FIRST ONE WE COME TO IS THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
I RATHER LIKE THIS IT'S SWEET WITH ITS PAINTED FLOORBOARDS 
PROBABLY THE SAME SIZE AS OURS AT THE MOMENT 
NEXT DOOR IS BEDROOM NUMBER ONE 
ERM WHICH IS A COMPACT DOUBLE IT'S REALLY RATHER QUAINT 
CERTAINLY THE CHARACTER OF THE PROPERTY IS STILL VERY MUCH INTACT 
THIS IS SOMETHING I LOVE 
THIS WINDOW SEAT LOOKING OUT OVER THE GARDEN 
AND AT THE END OF THE OLD PART OF THE HOUSE IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
IT DEFINITELY FEELS MUCH MORE COTTAGEY UPSTAIRS 
AS FIONA POINTS OUT THERE'S LOTS OF DUAL ASPECTS 
THE HOUSE DOES FEEL QUITE LIGHT FOR A COTTAGE 
NICE BEDROOM THE OTHER ONE'S TINY THOUGH MM 
IN HERE SQUEEZED INTO THIS LITTLE AREA 
THERE IS A PRETTY TINY EN SUITE 
MY FAMILY DID SAY THEY WANTED CHARACTER AND THERE'S NO DOUBT 
IN THE UNIQUENESS VALUE OF THIS FLOOR WE'RE RIGHT UP IN THE ROOFS 
MILLIE AND MADDIE WOULD LOVE THAT 
THEY COULD STAY UP THERE ALL DAY AND PLAY AND THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE THERE FOR TOYS 
BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT REALLY LOVELY 
SO LOADS OF ORIGINALITY BUT THERE IS A DRAWBACK 
BECAUSE THESE TWO BEDROOMS THREE AND FOUR ARE ADJOINING 
THE ONLY THING MY FAMILY COULD DO REALLY 
IS TO HAVE THE TWO GIRLS UP HERE 
SO THAT'S THE WHOLE OF THE HOUSE 
I'M NOW GOING OUTSIDE TO HAVE A LOOK AT THAT ALL IMPORTANT GARDEN 
SO I'M COMING OUT OF THE KITCHEN DOOR TO THE GARDEN 
THIS IS ACTUALLY A FAIRLY AVERAGE SIZED PLOT 
IN FACT I'D GO SO FAR AS TO SAY IT MIGHT NOT BE BIG ENOUGH FOR SARAH 
THE POND WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE TO GO BUT APPARENTLY IT WOULD BE QUITE EASY TO TAKE OUT 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF GOOD STORAGE SHEDS OVER THERE IN THE CORNER 
HOWEVER YOU CAN PROBABLY HEAR IN THE BACKGROUND 
THE M. FORTY IS ON YOUR DOORSTEP 
SO THAT WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT TO LIVING HERE 
I'M A BIT BOTHERED ABOUT THE NOISE OF THE ROAD 
AT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THIS PROPERTY HAS THE TWO LIVING SPACES MY FAMILY WANT 
AND LOTS OF POTENTIAL INSIDE 
THERE'S ALSO OUTSIDE STORAGE BUT THAT GARDEN MAY BE TOO SMALL 
FOR ALISTAIR AND ITS LISTED STATUS 
WOULD RESTRICT ANY WORK THEY'D WANT TO DO 
I'M A BIT BOTHERED ABOUT THAT SMALL GUEST BEDROOM 
AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THE KITCHEN'S QUITE SMALL 
AND SO IS THE DINING ROOM 
IT'S A PLUS THAT IT'S GOT A CELLAR 
I AGREE I THINK THE GARDEN'S A BIT SMALL THOUGH 
THE NEXT PROPERTY ON MY LIST IS IN THE QUINTESSENTIALLY ENGLISH VILLAGE OF SHUTFORD 
AGAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JOHNSONS' PREFERRED AREA 
JUST FIVE MILES SOUTH OF BANBURY 
I'VE DONE A BIT OF RESEARCH AND I CAN SAFELY SAY 
THIS VILLAGE IS TICKING A LOT OF ALISTAIR AND SARAH'S BOXES 
IT'S GOT BAGS OF CHARACTER THERE'S A THRIVING MOTHER TODDLER SCENE AND A GOOD LOCAL PUB 
ALL OF THAT SLAP BANG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NORTH OXFORDSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE 
SHUTFORD PROSPERED WITH THE GROWTH OF THE FABRIC INDUSTRY IN THE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS 
IT'S HERE THAT I'VE FOUND THE STUD HOUSE 
WHICH DATES BACK TO THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
AT FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND IT'S AT THE TOP END OF ALISTAIR AND SARAH'S BUDGET 
BUT I'M HOPING IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY 
I LIKE THE FRONT OF THAT IT'S VERY PRETTY I LOVE THE STONE 
BUT IT'S RIGHT ON A ROAD AS WELL 
HELLO THERE HELLO SIMON 
I FEEL LIKE I'VE COME INTO THE CENTRE OF THIS PROPERTY 
THAT'S RIGHT EVERYWHERE LEADS OFF FROM HERE 
AND WE'VE GOT THE SITTING ROOM ON THE RIGHT SHALL WE DO THIS ONE FIRST 
SO THIS IS THE MAIN SITTING ROOM THAT'S RIGHT THERE IS ANOTHER ROOM IN THE CENTRE OF THE HOUSE 
IT'S NICE THAT YOU'RE TUCKED AWAY HERE ON THE LEFT AWAY FROM ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S GOING ON 
YOU WOULD HAVE THIS AS THE SMART ADULTS ONLY AREA 
WE'D NEED TO DO SOME STUFF TO IT DECORATING DEFINITELY TO GET RID OF THE PURPLE 
YOU DON'T LIKE IT NOPE 
GOT SOME LOVELY FLAGSTONE FLOORING 
YEAH IT IS NICE I ALMOST PREFER THIS ACTUALLY THIS SITTING ROOM 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE AND AGAIN IT'S GOT SOME VERY NICE FEATURES 
I THINK WITH THAT FIREPLACE WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO RIP OUT THE DESK 
AND PUT SOMETHING ORIGINAL BACK IN I THINK 
OH GOOD SPACIOUS KITCHEN YES IT IS A GOOD SIZE 
IT'S EXCELLENT AND THEN THERE IS THE KITCHEN BREAKFAST ROOM NICE SURPRISE THERE 
IT'S A BIT SMALL BUT IF IT WAS A NICE 
IF IT WAS ONLY THE KITCHEN AREA AND SORT OF A BREAKFAST AREA 
JUST THE BREAKFAST ROOM IT'S A NICE SIZE 
IF THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT FOR YOUR DINING AREA THEN IT'S TOO SMALL 
HERE WE'RE LOOKING OUT ON TO THE GARDEN THAT'S RIGHT 
EXCELLENT SHALL WE MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH WHAT'S IN HERE SIMON 
THAT'S JUST A STORAGE CUPBOARD 
O. K. AND THIS IS THE CONSERVATORY LOVELY ISN'T IT 
GOODNESS ME ANOTHER LITTLE DOOR THROUGH THERE WHAT'S THAT 
THAT'S A SHOWER ROOM O. K. VERY HANDY AGAIN 
SO DOWN THERE MUST BE THE CELLAR THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S A GOOD SIZE 
ABOUT THIRTEEN FOOT SQUARE 
AND THE CURRENT OWNERS USE IT AS A UTILITY ROOM 
POTENTIAL THERE FOR A DARK ROOM FOR ME YEAH ABSOLUTELY 
SO OUT ACROSS THE PATIO AND UP INTO THE MAIN PART OF THE GARDEN 
NOW THIS LITTLE BUILDING HERE WHICH IS RATHER SWEET LOVELY OLD STONE 
IS CURRENTLY A WORKSHOP BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE IN TIME 
ALISTAIR AND SARAH COULD CONVERT THIS MAYBE INTO AN OFFICE OR OUTSIDE WORKING SPACE 
AND THEN HERE IS THE GARDEN ITSELF 
IT'S PRETTY MUCH LAID TO LAWN SO SARAH'S THINKING 
GOSH I'M GOING TO BE WORN OUT WITH ALL THAT GRASS CUTTING 
NOT TO WORRY BECAUSE WHEN SHE'S DONE IT SHE CAN JUST POP INTO THIS LITTLE BUILDING HERE 
AND RELAX IN HER VERY OWN SAUNA 
OH MY GOODNESS 
OH WE'D HAVE PEOPLE UP EVERY WEEKEND FOR THAT 
THE FIRST OF THE FOUR BEDROOMS IS ABOVE THE FORMAL SITTING ROOM AND IT'S THE MASTER ROOM 
THIS IS A DECEPTIVELY SIZED BEDROOM BECAUSE THIS IS ACTUALLY A SIX FOOT SLEIGH BED 
LOTS OF NICE FEATURES AS WELL LOVELY OLD FLOORBOARDS THE ORIGINAL DADO RAIL 
AND IN THE FAR CORNER THERE YOU'VE GOT AN EN SUITE BATHROOM 
AND ALONG THE CORRIDOR THIS IS BEDROOM NUMBER TWO 
AND IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD SIZED DOUBLE 
NEXT DOOR BEDROOM NUMBER THREE IS PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL 
IT'S GOT POTS OF CHARACTER BUT STILL A PRACTICAL SIZE YOU CAN GET A DOUBLE BED IN IT 
SO THESE TWO ROOMS WILL BE PERFECT FOR MADDIE AND MILLIE 
NO ARGUMENTS OVER WHO'S GOING TO GET THE BIGGEST ONE 
IT SEEMS THAT FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR WE GET THE LOWER THE DOORFRAMES GET 
SO THAT ONE'S QUITE SMALL THIS ONE'S REALLY LOW 
ONCE YOU'RE IN HERE IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY SPACIOUS FAMILY BATHROOM 
AGAIN I THINK IT'D BE A GOOD PROJECT FOR ALISTAIR AND SARAH TO UPDATE THIS 
GIVE IT A SLIGHTLY MORE POLISHED LOOK 
SO UP TO THE VERY TOP OF THE HOUSE IN THE ATTIC 
WE HAVE A DEMONSTRATION OF THE JOYS OF LIVING IN A VERY OLD PROPERTY 
BECAUSE YOU END UP WITH EXTRAORDINARY QUIRKY FEATURES LIKE THIS OLD TIMBER WORK 
SO THIS IS DESCRIBED AS A LITTLE DRESSING AREA AND IT LEADS INTO BEDROOM NUMBER FOUR 
THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE NO KNOCKING THROUGH OF THAT WALL GIVEN ITS DEPTH 
IT IS ON THE SMALL SIDE BUT IT WOULD TAKE A DOUBLE BED 
I THINK IT WOULD MAKE QUITE A FUN GUEST ROOM 
MY SECOND PROPERTY MIGHT SET ALISTAIR AND SARAH BACK 
ALMOST HALF A MILLION POUNDS 
BUT IT DOES HAVE THE BONUS OF A GOOD SIZED CELLAR AND OUTBUILDINGS 
PLUS THE LAYOUT DOWNSTAIRS IS GREAT FOR FAMILY LIFE 
HOWEVER THE UPSTAIRS CEILINGS ARE A BIT LOW 
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT'LL SUIT ALISTAIR 
WHEN THEY FIND THEIR DREAM HOME ONE OF THE FIRST ADDITIONS TO THE JOHNSON HOUSEHOLD 
WILL BE A DOG AND IF ALISTAIR HAS HIS WAY A LABRADOR 
OXFORDSHIRE DOG BREEDER CATRIONA SHELDON AGREES 
THAT THEY'RE BEST SUITED TO COUNTRY LIFE 
OXFORDSHIRE'S A FANTASTIC PLACE TO BRING UP A DOG 
COS WE HAVE LOADS OF BRILLIANT WALKS 
OF THE SIXTY ONE MILLION DOGS IN THE U. K. 
LABRADORS ARE THE MOST POPULAR BREED 
THEY'RE GOOD WITH CHILDREN THEY DON'T MIND HAVING THEIR TAILS OR EARS PULLED THEY'RE PATIENT 
IF YOU'RE THINKING OF BUYING A LABRADOR YOU SHOULD GO OUT DO YOUR RESEARCH ON REPUTABLE BREEDERS 
THEY ARE INCREDIBLY GREEDY THEY ARE BASICALLY DUSTBINS ON LEGS 
AND THEY DO RUN TO FAT 
SO AGAIN IT'S ANOTHER REASON TO HAVE THEM IN THE COUNTRY WITH LOTS OF SPACE TO RUN AROUND IN 
JUST BRILLIANT TEMPERAMENT GREAT FRIENDS 
STILL TO COME ON ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRY 
SARAH AND ALISTAIR ARE BOWLED OVER BY THE INTERIOR OF MY FINAL PROPERTY 
OH IT'S GREAT 
IT'S JUST LIKE IT WAS ON THE FILM 
IT'S SUCH A LOVELY SIZE SO BRIGHT IT'S A FANTASTIC SPACE 
BUT THEY STILL CAN'T SEE EYE TO EYE ON THE SIZE OF THE GARDEN 
I THINK THE GARDEN'S A LITTLE BIT TOO SMALL 
WHICH I COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH AND I THINK THE GARDEN IS A GREAT SIZE 
IT'S DAY TWO OF MY SEARCH 
AND I'VE TRAVELLED TO THE ANCIENT VILLAGE OF SALFORD 
FOURTEEN MILES FROM BANBURY 
I'VE DECIDED TO SHOW ALISTAIR AND SARAH ONE PROPERTY 
THAT'S RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE POPULAR COTSWOLDS 
SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW COMING FURTHER WEST IN THE COUNTY 
AFFECTS HOW MUCH YOU GET FOR YOUR MONEY 
ESPECIALLY AS THIS IS ONE OF MY MOST EXPENSIVE PROPERTIES 
I'VE DISCOVERED THE COMMUNITY HERE IS VERY ACTIVE 
THERE'S A VILLAGE HALL A MOTHER AND TODDLER GROUP AND A LOCAL PUB 
MY FIRST PROPERTY IS MEADOW COTTAGE 
A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE WITH A STUDY AND A REALLY BIG GARDEN 
ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
HELLO EMMA NICE TO SEE YOU 
HI NICE TO SEE YOU TOO THIS BODES WELL FROM OUTSIDE 
IT'S A CHARMING COTTAGE IT'S LOVELY 
SHALL WE HEAD INSIDE AND HAVE A LOOK AROUND SURE 
THAT LOOKS LOVELY FROM THE OUTSIDE REALLY NICE 
I LOVE THE PLANTS GROWING UP THE OUTSIDE REALLY NICE FRONT DOOR 
SO YOU'VE GOT THE HANGING COATS AND WELLIES AREA THERE YUP 
AND THIS IS THE MAIN HALL WHICH YOU CALL A DINING HALL 
I'M ALWAYS SCEPTICAL ABOUT DINING HALLS SO WHERE'S THE TABLE 
AT THE MOMENT THE TABLE'S THROUGH THERE RIGHT 
WHAT MY CLIENT DOES IS BRING THE TABLE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM 
WHEN SHE'S HAVING DINNER PARTIES IS THIS THE SITTING ROOM 
IT IS YES OH NOW THIS IS A REALLY PLEASANT ROOM ISN'T IT 
IT'S LOVELY I THINK THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF FURNITURE HERE 
SO IF YOU REARRANGED IT YOU COULD MAKE THE ROOM FEEL A LOT BIGGER 
IT'S A GREAT SIZED ROOM BUT I THINK WE'D NEED TO DO SOME SERIOUS DECORATING YEAH 
WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS THE WINDOWS OPENING OUT ONTO THE PATIO THAT GOES STRAIGHT ONTO THE TERRACE 
LET'S GO BACK ACROSS THE HALL AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE KITCHEN 
BACK ACROSS THE DINING HALL AND INTO THIS AREA 
WHICH ACTUALLY I LOVE AND I THINK MY FAMILY WOULD REALLY LIKE IT 
BECAUSE THEY WANTED AN AREA THAT THEY CAN SIT AND HAVE INFORMAL EATING WITH THE GIRLS 
AND SO THERE'S THE STEP DOWN INTO THE WORKING KITCHEN ITSELF 
IT'S AN L. SHAPE ISN'T IT IT WORKS QUITE WELL YOU'VE GOT YOUR PREPARATION AREA HERE 
THE UTILITY AREA AND THROUGH TO THE GARAGE 
O. K. SO YOU GO OUT THAT DOOR OUT TO THE GARDEN THERE YEAH 
WHAT'S IN HERE A STORAGE CUPBOARD OH O. K. BRILLIANT THAT'S HANDY 
AND THEN THROUGH INTO THE STUDY 
IT WOULD BE A GREAT STUDY ACTUALLY POSSIBLY EVEN A PLAY AREA FOR THE KIDS 
SHALL WE GO OUT AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE GARDEN YES 
THE ALL IMPORTANT GARDEN EXACTLY HOW LONG IS THIS EMMA 
IT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FEET 
I LOVE THIS PATIO AREA HERE REALLY GOOD FOR SUMMER DINING IT'S LOVELY 
IT'S A GREAT SIZE COUPLE OF DOGS RUNNING AROUND THERE 
KICK THE BALL AROUND WITH THE GIRLS YEAH EXCELLENT 
THE REST OF IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S PRETTY MUCH LAID TO LAWN 
IT IS ALTHOUGH AT THE END WE HAVE A VEGETABLE GARDEN 
OH I SEE SO TUCKED BEHIND THAT LITTLE HEDGE A VEGETABLE GARDEN 
DO I SPY A GREENHOUSE YOU DO INDEED RIGHT THAT'S THE GARDEN DONE 
I NEED TO HAVE A LOOK ROUND UPSTAIRS SO WE'LL HEAD INSIDE THE HOUSE AND CARRY ON 
SO THERE ARE FOUR BEDROOMS THIS IS THE FIRST 
IT'S A SMALL DOUBLE BUT IT HAS GOT THE BENEFIT OF REALLY FANTASTIC FITTED CUPBOARDS 
REALLY PRETTY ROOM WITH THE CUPBOARD SPACE AS WELL 
WE'D BE ABLE TO HIDE ALL THEIR TOYS OUT OF VIEW 
AND THEN ACROSS THE HALLWAY IS BEDROOM NUMBER TWO 
WHICH IS A REALLY GOOD SIZE PLENTY OF SPACE FOR TWIN BEDS 
NOW THIS IS THE MAIN BATHROOM 
AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S SLIGHTLY ON THE TEENY SIDE 
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER BATHROOM SO THAT DOES COMPENSATE FOR IT SLIGHTLY 
NOW ON THE LANDING HERE YOU'VE ACCESS UP TO THE LOFT 
SO THAT'S SOME USEFUL EXTRA STORAGE 
THIS IS BEDROOM NUMBER THREE AGAIN IT'S PRETTY TINY THEY SQUEEZED A DOUBLE BED IN THERE 
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH SPACE FOR ANYTHING ELSE BUT JUST AT THE END OF THE HOUSE HERE 
THIS REALLY IS THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE 
THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM AND GOODNESS IT'S A REALLY GOOD ONE 
IT'S HUGE PLENTY OF SPACE FOR A BIG DOUBLE BED 
YOU CAN GET A SOFA IN HERE A LITTLE DRESSING TABLE IT REALLY IS A GOOD MASTER BEDROOM 
THAT'S A FAB SIZE THAT'S REALLY REALLY GOOD 
GET RID OF THE PINK BUT THAT WOULD FIT EVERYTHING 
AS IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH YOU'VE ALSO GOT GOOD FITTED CUPBOARDS 
AND AN EN SUITE BATHROOM AND AGAIN IN THIS CASE 
IT'S A REALLY GOOD ONE 
SO ALL IN ALL THIS ROOM IS THE WINNER IN THIS HOUSE 
THIS DEFINITELY HAS A GREAT GARDEN 
AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE MASTER BEDROOMS 
I'VE SEEN FOR A LONG TIME 
BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED ABOUT THE PRACTICALITY OF THE DINING HALL 
ALTHOUGH IT COULD MAKE THE PERFECT PLAY AREA FOR THE GIRLS 
I LIKE THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
THE WINDOWS ARE NICE IT LOOKS REALLY BIG IT'S A WIDE HOUSE 
I DON'T LIKE THE LAYOUT 
I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THE KITCHEN OPENS UP INTO THE HALLWAY 
IT'S A GOOD SPACE AND A REALLY GOOD SIZED GARDEN 
FOR MY FINAL PROPERTY I'M BACK IN NORTH OXFORDSHIRE 
IN THE VILLAGE OF SUMMERTON JUST EIGHT MILES SOUTH OF BANBURY 
I'VE JUST DRIVEN THROUGH SUMMERTON 
IT'S A REALLY PRETTY VILLAGE WHICH SHOULD APPEAL TO ALISTAIR AND SARAH 
DEALER'S COTTAGE IS SLIGHTLY OUT OF THE VILLAGE 
BUT THE BIG BONUS OF THAT IS IT FEELS OUT IN THE OPEN COUNTRYSIDE 
THIS PROPERTY HAS FOUR BEDROOMS A STUDY TWO LIVING ROOMS 
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT FORMAL DINING ROOM 
IT'S PRICED AT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND WELL WITHIN THEIR BUDGET 
I'LL BE SHOWN AROUND BY RICHARD DELEMOS 
WHO HAS LIVED HERE FOR TWELVE YEARS 
HI RICHARD NICE TO SEE YOU 
SO HERE WE ARE DEALER'S COTTAGE AND TELL ME ABOUT THE HISTORY OF IT 
COTTAGES WERE ORIGINALLY BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX 
DEALER'S COTTAGE IS ACTUALLY TWO COTTAGES JOINED TOGETHER 
SOMETIME AROUND THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
THAT LOOKS PRETTY THAT'S REALLY PRETTY 
RIGHT IN WE COME 
OH NOW THIS IS A LOVELY BIG ROOM IS THIS YOUR MAIN SITTING ROOM 
IT IS WE SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME IN HERE 
I LIKE THE SPACE IT'S QUITE A BIG ERM 
AREA TO MOVE AROUND QUITE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY 
BUT A LITTLE BIT NARROW 
THIS MAGNIFICENT FIREPLACE WHEN WAS THIS PUT IN 
THIS WAS BUILT AROUND FIVE YEARS AGO 
WE HAVE A MULTI FUEL STOVE HERE WHICH WILL BURN COAL OR LOGS 
I QUITE LIKE THAT NICE WARM WINTER NIGHTS IN FRONT OF THE FIRE 
LET'S HEAD OFF IN THIS DIRECTION FIRST 
OH THIS IS SWEET 
HOW DO YOU FIND IT IN TERMS OF PRACTICAL USAGE AS A KITCHEN 
IT'S VERY PRACTICAL WE BOTH ENJOY COOKING VERY MUCH 
THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE TO WORK AROUND RIGHT 
AND IT'S GOT ALL SORTS OF NOOKS AND CRANNIES THERE'S A LITTLE STORAGE SPACE THERE 
THERE'S A WALK IN PANTRY IN THE CORNER RIGHT TUCKED UNDER THE STAIRS 
AND WHAT'S THROUGH THE FAR END OF THE COTTAGE THERE 
THAT LEADS THROUGH TO A UTILITY ROOM AND DOWNSTAIRS LOO 
REALLY NICE A WAY TO KEEP EVERYTHING OUT OF SIGHT 
I LIKE IT ACTUALLY NOT NECESSARILY WHAT WE WOULD HAVE GONE FOR 
SO THIS IS NOW THROUGH TO TO THE DINING ROOM 
THIS IS A PROPER GROWN UP FORMAL DINING ROOM ISN'T IT 
WHICH IS VERY MUCH A BONUS THING ON MY COUPLE'S WISH LIST 
THAT'S A MUCH BETTER SPACE THAT WOULD FIT OUR TABLE 
IT'S REALLY NICE FOR DINNER PARTIES WHEN WE HAVE OUR FRIENDS UP TO STAY 
IT IS A GOOD SIZE ISN'T IT 
FROM WHAT I SAW ON THE FLOOR PLAN THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ORIGINAL BACK WALL OF THE COTTAGE 
YES AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BACK DOOR TO THE SECOND COTTAGE 
RIGHT SO THIS IS THE ADDITION 
THAT'S RIGHT THIS WAS ADDED TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO PRIMARILY AS A STUDY 
STUDY IT DEFINITELY WOULDN'T BE KIDS' PLAYROOM AGAIN 
I CAN SEE US USING THAT ALL THE TIME 
IT JUST SEEMS REALLY REALLY LIGHT 
IT SEEMS TO ME A REALLY FLEXIBLE HOUSE EVERY ROOM GIVES YOU LOTS OF OPTIONS 
THAT'S RIGHT SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH IT MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE 
WHAT ANOTHER FAMILY WOULD NOW THEN THIS IS AMAZING THIS IS LOVELY 
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT JUST LOOK AT THE GARDEN AND THE VIEW 
YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE SITTING IN THERE ANY TIME OF THE YEAR AND RELAXING 
THAT SEEMS TO ME LIKE A REALLY NICE FAMILY ROOM 
I LOVE THIS GLASS ROOF AND THE BIG GLASS WALL THERE AS WELL 
IT LEADS ONTO THE GARDEN SO IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO EXPLORE OUTSIDE I'LL SEE YOU LATER 
ALTHOUGH THIS GARDEN IS ONLY A QUARTER OF AN ACRE 
IT'S GOT LOTS GOING ON IN IT JUST OVER THE HEDGE THERE 
THERE'S A SMALL PARKING AREA AND A SHED AND A STORE 
NOW IF THEY WERE FEELING GUNG HO THEY COULD TURN THAT INTO A DARKROOM FOR SARAH 
AND THEN THERE'S A VEGETABLE PATCH OVER THERE AND A CHICKEN COOP NO LESS 
MILLIE WOULD JUST LOVE THAT 
IMAGINE GOING OUT THERE AND COLLECTING THE EGGS IN THE MORNING 
NOW I'M GOING BACK INSIDE TO LOOK UPSTAIRS 
THESE ARE THE STAIRS LEADING UP FROM THE FRONT DOOR 
BUT I COULD HAVE EQUALLY COME UP THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE 
THIS IS BEDROOM ONE WHICH COULD HAPPILY TAKE A DOUBLE BED 
AND NOT BE TOO SQUASHED AND ACROSS THE HALLWAY IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
A GREAT POINT ABOUT THIS ROOM IS THAT IT'S AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
IT'S NOT VAST BUT LET'S NOT FORGET WE ARE IN A COTTAGE HERE 
THE REASON IT'S SLIGHTLY SMALLER IS THEY'VE STOLEN A CORNER OF IT 
TO MAKE AN EN SUITE SHOWER ROOM 
RICHARD AND HIS WIFE PUT THIS IN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO 
SO IT'S ALL SPARKLING AND NEW AND ACTUALLY NOT A BAD SIZE 
SO DOWN THE CORRIDOR AND THE FIRST ROOM WE COME TO IS THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
HANDILY PLACED RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE AND IT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZE 
IT'S GOT A PROPER DOUBLE SHOWER THERE A RATHER SWEET CLAW FOOTED BATH 
OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM YOU'VE GOT ACCESS TO THE LOFT 
WHICH I'M TOLD RUNS THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE TWO COTTAGES 
IF THEY'RE FEELING REALLY BRAVE THEY COULD DO A LOFT CONVERSION 
THAT GIVES IT POTENTIAL TO MAKE IT INTO AN EXCELLENT SIZED FAMILY HOUSE 
ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN GO UP TO THE LOFT AND IT'LL BE FANTASTIC 
THEY'VE GOT FOUR BEDROOMS THIS IS THE THIRD 
IT'S A VERY VERY SMALL DOUBLE POSSIBLY BETTER AS A SINGLE FOR ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS 
AND THEN ACROSS THE CORRIDOR SO NOW WE'RE BACK AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
THIS IS BEDROOM FOUR IT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZE IT'D MAKE A VERY PLEASANT GUEST ROOM 
I THINK IT'S A REALLY PRETTY PLACE 
THE OWNERS HAVE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO PUT THE PERIOD FEATURES BACK IN 
I THINK IT'S A REALLY NICE PLACE IT'S NICE 
NOW THAT ALISTAIR AND SARAH HAVE SEEN MY FOUR HOUSES 
IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO DECIDE WHICH TWO THEY WANT TO VIEW 
SAINT BRIDES COTTAGE IN OVERTHORPE ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
HAS A REAL WOW FACTOR AND IS PACKED WITH FEATURES AND CHARACTER 
AND THE THATCHED ROOF SHOULD APPEAL 
BUT WILL THEY BE HAPPY WITH THE SIZE OF THE DINING ROOM 
THE STUD HOUSE IN SHUTFORD AT FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
IS AT THE TOP END OF THEIR BUDGET 
IT COMES COMPLETE WITH CELLAR UTILITY ROOM 
BUT THE REST OF THE DOWNSTAIRS AREA 
MAY NEED A BIT OF THOUGHT TO FIND SPACE FOR THAT FORMAL DINING ROOM 
MEADOW COTTAGE IN SALFORD IS ALSO ON THE MARKET AT FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
THE SIZEABLE GARDEN SHOULD APPEAL TO ALISTAIR 
BUT THE OPEN PLAN LAYOUT DOWNSTAIRS MIGHT TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO 
DEERS COTTAGE IN SUMMERTON IS MY FINAL PROPERTY 
HERE THE JOHNSONS HAVE THE OPTION TO EXTEND INTO THE ATTIC 
AND IT'S WELL WITHIN BUDGET AT FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
IT'S IN A VERY RURAL AREA 
BUT MY ONLY CONCERN IS WHETHER THE GARDEN IS BIG ENOUGH FOR ALISTAIR 
WELL LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE ER 
THE PROPERTIES THEN 
THIS IS SAINT BRIDES WITH THE THATCHED ROOF 
THE EXTENSION OUT THE BACK WAS QUITE NARROW 
FOR ME THIS WAS A NO I TEND TO AGREE ACTUALLY 
NOW STUD HOUSE THIS I REALLY LIKED 
I THOUGHT THIS PROPERTY WAS LOVELY 
MY ONLY CONCERN WITH THIS ONE WAS THAT THE DINING AREA 
WAS A LITTLE BIT TINY 
I LIKE THAT ONE SO LET'S PUT THAT ON THE YES PILE LET'S PUT THAT ONE ON THE YES PILE 
RIGHT NEXT ONE IS MEADOW COTTAGE 
THE DINING ROOM ITSELF WELL THE DINING AREA WASN'T VERY GOOD 
GOOD SIZED GARDEN THAT'S A POSSIBLE PILE ISN'T IT 
DEERS COTTAGE NOW THIS I THINK FOR ME WAS MY FAVOURITE 
I LOVED THE GARDEN ROOM 
I THINK THE GARDEN'S A LITTLE BIT TOO SMALL WHICH I COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH 
I THINK THE GARDEN IS A GREAT SIZE IT'S A YES PUT THAT IN THE YES PILE 
I THINK WE'LL JUST GO WITH DEERS COTTAGE AND THE STUD HOUSE YEAH O. K. 
THE JOHNSONS HAVE MADE THEIR CHOICES 
AND SO THEY'RE OFF TO NORTH OXFORDSHIRE 
TO THE VILLAGE OF SHUTFORD TO SEE STUD HOUSE 
HELLO HI HI NICE TO SEE YOU 
YOU'VE LEFT THE GIRLS AT HOME SO WE CAN CONCENTRATE ON HOUSE HUNTING 
HERE'S THE FIRST PROPERTY WHAT DO YOU THINK FROM THE OUTSIDE IT'S LOVELY 
THE STONEWORK IS WHAT WE WANTED FROM MOVING ROUND HERE 
IT'S SUCH A LOVELY QUIET ROAD AS WELL 
THE VILLAGE IS LOVELY JUST COMING INTO IT LET'S GET INSIDE AND HAVE A LOOK AROUND FOLLOW ME 
RIGHT SO IN YOU COME 
THIS IS THE SITTING ROOM 
IT'S QUITE A SWEET LITTLE ROOM THIS WOULD MAKE A LOVELY ER 
ADULT ONLY ROOM REALLY NICE LITTLE ROOM IT'S GREAT 
MY CONCERN WAS THAT YOU'D THINK IT WAS A BIT SMALL 
WE'D BE HAPPY WITH SOMETHING THIS SIZE AS LONG AS IT WASN'T THE ONLY ROOM 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE IS ANOTHER LIVING SPACE SO LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT THAT 
I THINK WE COULD MAKE THIS A DINING ROOM 
I THINK THIS WOULD LOOK LOVELY A GREAT STONE FLOOR 
DO YOU THINK OUR TABLE WOULD FIT IN HERE 
HOW BIG IS YOUR TABLE IT'S ABOUT SEVEN FOOT BY THREE FOOT 
THERE YOU GO THAT'S DEFINITELY LOADS OF SPACE I THINK THAT WOULD WORK 
I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE PLAYROOM THOUGH 
YEAH IT MIGHT BE IT MIGHT BE A DINING ROOM 
I THINK YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO TAKE OUT THE DESK IN THERE IT WOULDN'T WORK AS A STUDY AT ALL 
TO LOOK AT REINSTATING THAT AS A FIREPLACE WOULD BE THE BEST THING A BIG JOB A VERY BIG JOB 
SO THE NEXT ROOM IS THE KITCHEN 
LOW CEILINGS THAT'S NOT TOO BAD 
COS I. I'M O. K. I'M QUITE TALL YEAH 
I REALLY LIKED IT COS IT'S GOT THE DINING AREA NEXT TO IT 
THE SORT OF INFORMAL DINING SPACE THAT YOU WERE KEEN ON ALISTAIR 
YOU COULD HAVE YOUR BREAKFAST AND TEAS WITH THE GIRLS 
THAT'D BE IDEAL FOR WATCHING THE CHILDREN WHILE WE'RE COOKING 
IT'S PROBABLY NOT GONNA WORK FOR YOU IN TERMS OF THIS FORMAL DINING SPACE 
OUR TABLE WOULD TAKE UP THE WHOLE ROOM I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO GET THE TAPE MEASURE OUT 
LEAVE THE TAPE MEASURE BEHIND MIND YOUR HEADS IT'S VERY LOW 
VERY ODD SHAPE 
ERM I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'D DO WITH IT 
I THINK MAYBE THE CHILDREN'S AREA 
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO FIT A DINING TABLE 
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THERE NO AND ACTUALLY PROBABLY NOT HERE NO 
IT'S A SHAME REALLY THAT THE STAIRS ARE THERE I ASSUME THAT'S FOR THE CELLAR 
THAT IS FOR THE CELLAR AND FOR A CELLAR IT'S GOT VERY GRAND STAIRS YES 
SO THEY DO TAKE UP QUITE A LOT OF SPACE I REALLY LIKE IT ACTUALLY 
AS THE CHILDREN'S PLAY AREA I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT 
DOGS RUNNING IN WITH DIRTY CHILDREN AND MUDDY PAWS WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE MAIN HOUSE 
I'LL LET YOU TWO EXPLORE ON YOUR OWN NOW AND WE'LL MEET UP LATER AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK 
GREAT THANKS EXCELLENT 
ACTUALLY THE GARDEN'S NOT A BAD SIZE 
I COULD COPE WITH THIS SIZE I'D HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE PLANTING 
IT'S A BIT BARE IT'S A BIT BLAND 
I'D WANT IT TO BE PRETTIER WITH SOME MATURE BEDS 
DON'T WANT IT TO END UP LIKE A FOOTBALL PITCH I LIKE A FOOTBALL PITCH 
THE IS THE SAME SIZE OF OUR BED AND THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM TO MOVE AROUND 
FANTASTIC THEY'VE GOT THIS UTILITY ROOM HERE 
IT'S A GREAT SIZE BUT IT'S REALLY WARM SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT IDEAL TO STORE OUR WINE BUT IT'S A GOOD SIZE 
I THINK I'VE FOUND MYSELF A DARK ROOM 
THIS WOULD BE IDEAL I COULD BLACK OUT THE WINDOW 
PUT A SINK IN IT WOULD JUST BE PERFECT 
RIGHT SO YOU'VE SEEN THE WHOLE PROPERTY WHAT DO YOU THINK SO FAR 
I THINK WE'RE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED 
IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING FROM THE LAPTOP 
IT'S REALLY GROWN ON US ACTUALLY I LIKE IT A LOT 
OOH THAT'S THROWN A BIT OF A RED HERRING INTO IT HASN'T IT WE'VE GOT ANOTHER PROPERTY TO SEE YET 
SO WE'LL HEAD OFF TO PROPERTY NUMBER TWO GREAT GREAT 
SO HERE WE ARE AT PROPERTY NUMBER TWO WHAT'S YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION FROM THE OUTSIDE 
IT'S NOT AS QUIRKY AS THE FIRST PROPERTY NOT AS PRETTY 
WHAT ABOUT THIS LOCATION BECAUSE WE'RE MORE RURAL HERE 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT ISOLATED OUT HERE 
I'M NOT SURE HOW I'D GET USED TO THAT 
O. K. LET'S GET INSIDE BECAUSE THE HOUSE MAY SELL ITSELF TO YOU 
IN WE COME SIZE WISE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ROOM 
IT'S REALLY LOVELY IT SEEMS LIKE THIS AREA IS NOT USED FOR VERY MUCH 
SEEMS A BIT ODD MAYBE BECAUSE THE DOOR'S NOT IN AN IDEAL PLACE TO USE THE FOCAL POINT OF THE FIREPLACE 
MY IMPRESSION OF THIS ROOM IS THERE ARE TOO MANY DOORWAYS 
THAT IS A DOORWAY TO THE STAIRS THERE'S A STAIRCASE THERE SO YOU COULD BLOCK THAT ONE OFF 
AND THAT IS A DOORWAY TO THE DINING ROOM WHICH YOU CAN ALSO GET TO FROM THE KITCHEN 
SO THAT AGAIN COULD BE BLOCKED OFF 
AND THEN YOU CREATE A BETTER ROOM TO FURNISH YES 
SO INTO THE KITCHEN 
IT'S A REALLY QUIRKY LITTLE SWEET ROOM 
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN USED TO HAVING FITTED KITCHENS BUT THIS IS QUITE UNIQUE 
IT'S REALLY RUSTIC IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ALMOST ON HOLIDAY 
I CAN PICTURE MYSELF COOKING IN HERE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE FACILITY TO BE ABLE TO WATCH THE CHILDREN 
IT LEADS INTO THE DINING ROOM WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT ROOM FOR YOU 
SO LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT THAT NEXT 
THE KITCHEN FLOOR'S LOVELY SHAME THEY HAVEN'T CONTINUED IT THROUGH YEAH 
IT'S A LOVELY SPACE THOUGH HMM VERY NICE 
A REAL FORMAL DINING ROOM I CAN JUST PICTURE US HERE AT CHRISTMAS SAT ROUND THE TABLE IT'D BE LOVELY 
SO IF YOU FOLLOW ME THROUGH THIS WAY THIS WAS ADDED TO LEAD THROUGH TO WHAT WAS THE OLD BAR AT THE END 
I THINK THIS IS A ROOM THAT YOU QUITE LIKED 
OH IT'S GREAT 
IT'D JUST LIKE IT WAS ON THE FILM 
IT'S SUCH A LOVELY SIZE SO BRIGHT FANTASTIC SPACE 
THE CHILDREN PLAYING HERE WOULD BE LOVELY BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE GARDEN TO GO OUT ONTO 
ALSO IN THE EVENINGS YOU'D WANT TO SIT HERE AND WATCH THE SUN GO DOWN OVER THE FIELDS IT WOULD BE LOVELY 
THERE'S LOTS MORE TO SEE THERE'S THE ALL IMPORTANT GARDEN TO ARGUE ABOUT 
AND ALL THE BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS AS WELL SO WE'LL LET YOU WANDER AROUND 
AND HAVE A LOOK THEN WE'LL GET TOGETHER AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK GREAT BRILLIANT SEE YOU LATER 
THE GARDEN'S LOVELY BUT IT'S ON THE SMALL SIDE 
FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTED A SMALLER GARDEN YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR TUNE A LITTLE BIT 
YES YOU MAY BE RIGHT BUT THE CHICKENS ARE BRILLIANT AND LOOK AT THE VIEW IT'S ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
BIT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SIZE OF THE VEGETABLE PATCH 
SMALLER THAN WHAT I WAS EXPECTING 
BUT THE GARDEN DOES HAVE SCOPE YOU COULD CUT BACK SOME OF THESE TREES HERE MAKE IT FEEL A BIT MORE OPEN 
IT'S JUST MASSIVE SIZE UP THERE 
THERE'S LOADS OF ROOM FOR PUTTING IN A COUPLE OF ROOMS PROBABLY EVEN A BATHROOM AS WELL 
THAT WOULD MAKE THE PLACE ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE 
WE COULD USE THIS BEDROOM TAKE THE STAIRS BACK UP AND HAVE THIS LITTLE ROOM AS A STUDY THEN 
IT'D BE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
RIGHT WE'VE SEEN BOTH PROPERTIES NOW 
SO THE BIG QUESTION IS DO YOU LIKE EITHER OF THEM ENOUGH TO PUT IN AN OFFER 
THEY WERE BOTH GREAT BUT I'M NOT SURE WE'RE QUITE READY TO PUT AN OFFER IN YET 
SO AFTER OUR SEARCH TOGETHER IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU'VE TAKEN AWAY 
ANYTHING YOU'VE DEFINED IN YOUR SEARCH 
ONE OF THE THINGS WE NOW KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN A VILLAGE 
OR ON THE EDGE OF A VILLAGE AND NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE 
WE HAVE TO HAVE COMMUNITY THERE AND WHAT ABOUT THE GARDEN ISSUE 
DO YOU THINK EITHER ONE OF YOU IS RIGHT OR WRONG ARE YOU STILL ARGUING ABOUT IT 
I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO COMPROMISE ON THE GARDEN 
I THINK I'VE REALISED THAT PERHAPS I DO WANT A LITTLE MORE SPACE THAN I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT 
AND OBVIOUSLY I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO COMPROMISE AT ALL LARGE IS GOOD 
SO YOU FEEL YOU'VE WON THAT POINT ABSOLUTELY 
I WISH YOU BOTH THE BEST OF LUCK IN YOUR SEARCH AND ALL I ASK IS YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU EVENTUALLY BUY 
AND I WANT TO KNOW THE EXACT SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE GARDEN 
OH THANKS EVER SO MUCH 
A WEEK LATER SARAH AND ALISTAIR CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND PUT IN AN OFFER ON THE STUD HOUSE 
UNFORTUNATELY THEY WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL 
AND THEY'VE WIDENED THEIR HOUSE SEARCH TO INCLUDE WILTSHIRE
