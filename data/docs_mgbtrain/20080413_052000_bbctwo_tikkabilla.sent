YOU KNOW WHAT 
I THINK I MIGHT MAKE SOMETHING WITH LEAVES IN IT 
I'M GOING TO MAKE SOME FLOWERS AND PLANTS 
WE'LL START WITH THE FLOWERS 
FOR THE STEMS 
I'M GOING TO USE PIPE CLEANERS THEY'RE LOVELY COLOURS 
WE'LL START WITH LEAVES ON THE STEMS 
I'LL USE A COUPLE OF BITS OF GREEN CREPE PAPER 
YOU TWIST THE CREPE PAPER IN THE MIDDLE 
THEN TAKE THE PIPE CLEANER 
AND TWIST IT AROUND THE CENTRE OF THE PAPER 
NICE AND TIGHT LIKE THAT 
AND NOW WE HAVE A COUPLE OF LOVELY LEAVES ON THE STEM 
DO EXACTLY THE SAME WITH THE OTHER PIECE OF CREPE PAPER 
GET YOUR STEM HOLD IT IN THE MIDDLE 
AND TWIST IT AROUND THE CENTRE 
YOU MAY NEED SOME HELP 
THERE WE'VE GOT OUR LEAVES ON OUR STEMS 
NOW WE NEED OUR PETALS 
FOR THE PETALS I'M GOING TO USE SOME LOVELY COLOURFUL TISSUE PAPER 
PINK AND BLUE 
YOU CAN USE ANY COLOUR YOU LIKE 
FOR THE PETALS IF YOU MAKE A CIRCLE SHAPE WITH YOUR THUMB AND FINGER 
THEN POP THE TISSUE PAPER ON TOP 
THEN JUST PUSH THE TISSUE PAPER GENTLY 
THROUGH THE HOLE 
YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU CREATE A LOVELY PETAL SHAPE 
AT THE BACK 
CAREFULLY TAKE THE STEM 
AND WRAP IT AROUND THE END OF THE PAPER LIKE THAT 
LIKE THAT ISN'T THAT PRETTY 
NOW WE'LL DO EXACTLY THE SAME WITH THE OTHER ONE 
MAKE YOUR CIRCLE SHAPE 
POP THE TISSUE PAPER ON TOP AND PUSH IT THROUGH THE HOLE 
MAKING THAT LOVELY PETAL SHAPE 
AND THEN TAKE THE PIPE CLEANER 
AND WRAP IT AROUND THE BACK LIKE THAT 
THERE 
THAT SHOULD HOLD TOGETHER 
THEY LOOK GREAT DON'T THEY 
IF I JUST POP THOSE OVER THERE 
NEXT I'M GOING TO MAKE A LOVELY BIG LEAFY GREEN PLANT 
OUT OF THIS LARGE PIECE OF GREEN TISSUE PAPER 
WHAT WE DO IS WE FOLD THE TISSUE PAPER 
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM LIKE THAT 
NOT TOO TIGHTLY 
ALL THE WAY DOWN 
I'LL TAPE IT JUST SO IT DOESN'T MOVE AROUND WHEN WE GET TO THE BOTTOM 
GET SOME STICKY TAPE 
POP A COUPLE OF BITS 
AT EITHER END 
THERE WE GO THAT'LL HOLD IT TOGETHER 
THEN WE'LL TAKE SOME SCISSORS YOU MAY NEED HELP WITH THIS 
BECAUSE IT'S A BIT TRICKY 
CUTTING AT THE TOP OF THE TISSUE PAPER WITH THESE SCISSORS 
BE VERY CAREFUL TAKE YOUR TIME 
AND THEN CAREFULLY PULL THE CENTRE OF THE TISSUE PAPER TOWARDS YOU 
AND YOU'LL SEE 
A GREEN PLANT WILL START TO GROW 
CAN YOU SEE THAT 
THAT'S GREAT ISN'T IT THERE 
LOOK AT THAT 
THEN IF YOU JUST FOLD THE BOTTOM 
LIKE THAT 
IT KEEPS IT NICE AND STURDY 
WELL WE'VE GOT OUR GREEN PLANT AND OUR TWO LOVELY FLOWERS 
WE NEED SOMEWHERE FOR THEM TO GO 
I THOUGHT WE'D POP THEM IN A WINDOW BOX 
FOR THE WINDOW BOX I'M GOING TO USE THIS CARDBOARD BOX 
I THINK IT NEEDS DECORATING IT'S A BIT DULL 
I'VE GOT A STRIP OF COLOURED PAPER 
I'M GOING TO HAVE A YELLOW BOX 
THEN TAKE SOME STICKY TAPE 
TAPE THAT DOWN 
THAT LOOKS BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL DOESN'T IT 
OR YOU COULD PAINT IT 
OR EVEN DRAW ON IT WITH FELT TIP PENS OR CRAYONS 
I'LL USE A COUPLE OF GREEN ONES 
THAT BRIGHTENS IT UP DOESN'T IT 
THE WINDOW BOX IS READY FOR OUR PLANTS AND FLOWERS 
TO STICK THEM DOWN 
I'M GOING TO USE A COUPLE OF PIECES OF STICKY TACK 
WE'LL PUT THE PINK FLOWER IN FIRST 
JUST PUSH THAT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEM 
THEN STICK IT DOWN AT THE BACK OF YOUR WINDOW BOX 
YOU CAN SEE THAT 
YOUR FLOWERS SHOULD STAND UP IN THE BOX 
I'LL STICK IT DOWN A BIT MORE 
OOPS THERE WE GO 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE BIG GREEN PLANT 
FOR THIS WE NEED SOME STICKY TAPE 
JUST POP A BIT AT THE BOTTOM 
AND STICK THAT DOWN INSIDE AS WELL 
OUR LAST FLOWER 
CAN GO AT THE END 
I'LL USE ANOTHER PIECE OF STICKY TACK 
AND POP THAT IN THERE 
THERE WE GO LOOK AT THAT 
ONE BEAUTIFUL WINDOW BOX
