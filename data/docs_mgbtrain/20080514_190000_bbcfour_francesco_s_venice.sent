ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO 
ATTILA THE HUN BROUGHT TERROR TO THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN ITALY 
HE BURNED AND PILLAGED HIS WAY THROUGH VILLAGES AND TOWNS 
THE PEOPLE WERE LEFT WITH ONLY TWO CHOICES 
ESCAPE OR DIE 
THE REFUGEES ESCAPED TO THIS 
A GROUP OF TINY ISLANDS IN A MOSQUITO INFESTED LAGOON 
HERE THEY CREATED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITY IN THE WORLD VENICE 
THIS GREAT CITY IS A TEMPLE TO ROMANCE AND PASSION AND BEAUTY 
OFTEN BORNE OUT OF VIOLENCE AND DISEASE AMBITION AND LUST 
THIS PLACE HAS PRODUCED SOME OF THE MOST BRILLIANT ART THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN 
BUT ALL AROUND US EVERY STONE OF THE CITY EVERY BRICK 
IS A BRUSH STROKE ON THE GREATEST WORK OF ART OF ALL VENICE 
THE STORY OF VENICE IS ALSO MY STORY 
MY NAME IS FRANCESCO D. A. MOSTO I'M A VENETIAN 
MY FAMILY HAS LIVED HERE FOR MORE THAN A THOUSAND YEARS 
I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED HERE 
MY CHILDREN WERE BORN HERE 
AND I HOPE MY FAMILY WILL LIVE HERE FOR ANOTHER THOUSAND YEARS 
WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST FAMILIES TO COME TO THE LAGOON 
MY ANCESTORS HAD BEEN EVERYTHING 
FROM MERCHANTS TO PROSTITUTES TO EXPLORERS 
THE CITY IS IN MY BLOOD 
MOST GREAT CITIES GREW UP BECAUSE THEY WERE IN A GOOD LOCATION 
PARIS ROME LONDON 
BUT HERE VENICE NO 
THIS CITY GREW UP BECAUSE IT WAS IN A VERY VERY BAD LOCATION 
IT WAS A PERFECT HIDING PLACE FOR THE SETTLERS WHO FLED HERE FROM ATTILA THE HUN 
ALMOST SIXTEEN CENTURIES AGO 
THE VENETIAN LAGOON IS AN ENCLOSED SHALLOW SEA 
TWO HUNDRED SQUARE MILES OF SALT WATER 
DOTTED WITH TINY ISLANDS 
IT SITS AT THE TOP OF THE ADRIATIC SEA 
BETWEEN ITALY AND YUGOSLAVIA 
EVEN NOW MANY OF THE ISLANDS IN THE LAGOON ARE STRANGE AND DESOLATE PLACES 
EACH ONE LITTLE MORE THAN A BOGGY MARSH 
HALF SEA HALF LAND 
ALL MY LIFE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT VENICE IS SINKING 
BUT THESE ISLANDS HAVE BEEN SINKING FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME 
THEY'RE MADE OF SAND MUD 
NOT SOLID GROUND 
SO THE FIRST SETTLERS HAD TO INVENT A NEW WAY OF LIVING AND A NEW WAY TO BUILD 
THE FIRST HOUSES LOOKED LIKE THIS 
BUILT IN THE MUD AND ON THE WATER 
BUT BEFORE THEY COULD BUILD ANYTHING THEY HAD TO MAKE A SOLID FOUNDATION 
SO THEY BEGAN HAMMERING WOODEN PILES INTO THE LAGOON 
TODAY WE'RE STILL DOING THE SAME THING 
ALL OF VENICE IS BUILT ON A BED OF A HUGE WOODEN NAILS 
THE MARSHLAND WAS NO GOOD FOR FARMING 
SO THE EARLY SETTLERS HAD TO BECOME FISHERMEN 
THE SETTLERS LIVED ON THE FISH OF THE LAGOON BUT IT WAS ALSO THEIR CURRENCY 
THEY WOULD TRADE FISH 
FOR WOOD WHEAT AND WINE 
AND FISH IS STILL A GREAT PASSION FOR US VENETIANS 
THE FIRST BIG SETTLEMENT WAS ON THE ISLAND OF TORCELLO 
EIGHT KILOMETRES TO THE NORTH EAST OF VENICE TODAY 
ITS BASILICA STILL STANDS 
IT DATES FROM THE YEAR SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE 
HERE YOU FEEL CLOSE TO THE EARLY SETTLERS IN THE LAGOON 
STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE 
YET AMBITIOUS TO CREATE GREAT BEAUTY 
ON THE WEST WALL IS A SCENE OF THE LAST JUDGMENT 
BUT THIS IS NOT LIKE MOST ITALIAN CHURCHES 
TO THE WESTERN EYE THESE FIGURES ARE SURPRISING 
THEY ARE CHRISTIAN IMAGES 
BUT THEY ARE ROOTED IN ARTISTIC TRADITIONS FROM BEYOND EUROPE 
FROM THE EAST BEFORE IT WAS ISLAMIC 
IT WAS HERE IN TORCELLO THAT THE LAGOON DWELLERS FIRST SHOWED THEIR GENIUS IN ART 
BUT THEIR FUTURE WOULD NOT BE ON THIS ISLAND 
THEIR GREATEST CREATION VENICE LAY JUST AROUND THE CORNER 
WHEN THE SETTLERS HAD FLED ATTILA THE HUN THEY HAD OCCUPIED THE OUTER REACHES OF THE LAGOON 
AND FOR MORE THAN THREE CENTURIES THEY HAD BEEN SAFE 
BUT NOW PROSPERITY MADE THEM AN ATTRACTIVE TARGET 
IN THE YEAR EIGHT HUNDRED TEN THEY WERE ATTACKED 
THIS TIME FROM THE OPEN SEA 
THE SETTLERS FLED TO THE HEART OF THE LAGOON 
TO THE GROUP OF SMALL ISLANDS KNOWN AS THE RIVO ALTO 
BUT IN THE PANIC THEY WERE ABOUT TO STUMBLE ON THE SECRET OF THE LAGOON 
A DISCOVERY SHROUDED IN THE MISTS OF TIME 
THERE IS A LEGEND IN WHICH THE ATTACKERS WERE DIRECTED BY AN OLD WOMAN TO RIVO ALTO 
WITH JUST A SIMPLE WORD SHE SAID SEMPRE DRITTO STRAIGHT ON 
FAR FROM BETRAYING THE FLEEING SETTLERS THE OLD WOMAN OF THE LEGEND KNEW THE SECRET OF THE LAGOON 
THE SECRET THAT WOULD DESTROY ANY ENEMY FLEET 
THE SHIPS RAN AGROUND BECAUSE BENEATH THE CALM WATERS OF THE LAGOON 
LAY A TREACHEROUS UNDERWATER TERRAIN 
OF SHALLOWS AND MUDFLATS THAT WRECKED THE ENEMY FLEET 
SO IT WOULD BE HERE THE SETTLERS BUILT VENICE 
THE WATERS OF THE LAGOON WOULD PROTECT VENICE FROM LAND ATTACK 
WHILE THE SHALLOWS WOULD MAKE ATTACK BY SEA IMPOSSIBLE 
THE CITY WOULD BE A MIRACLE OF ITS GEOGRAPHY 
BUT ITS LOCATION WOULD ALSO MAKE LIFE HARD FOR THE FIRST VENETIANS 
IN SUMMER THE HEAT AND HUMIDITY CAN BE ALMOST UNBEARABLE 
IN THE EARLY DAYS MALARIA KILLED OFF MANY VENETIANS 
IN WINTER THE CITY LIES EXPOSED TO THE SNOWS AND BITING WIND 
BEATING DOWN FROM THE DOLOMITE MOUNTAINS TO THE NORTH 
BANKS OF FOG SWEEP IN ACROSS THE FLATLANDS OF THE LAGOON AND SETTLE OVER VENICE 
LIKE A DEEP IMPENETRABLE BLANKET THAT CLINGS TO THE NARROW WATERWAYS 
THE EARLY VENETIANS SET ABOUT MAKING THEIR NEW HOME INTO A PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK 
THEY WOULD EXPAND THE INLETS AND RIVERS OF THE RIVO ALTO ISLANDS 
INTO THE GREATEST NETWORK OF CANALS EVER CREATED 
TODAY DISTRACTED BY FINE CHURCHES AND PALACES 
WE FORGET THE FIRST GREAT SUCCESS OF THIS CITY WAS ITS CANALS 
THEY ARE TRIUMPHS OF EARLY ENGINEERING 
BUT THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A DELICATE BALANCE 
HARNESSING THE TIDAL WATERS OF THE LAGOON TO MAN'S NEEDS 
EVERY FEW YEARS EACH CANAL HAS TO BE BLOCKED BY A DAM THEN DRAINED 
SO THAT THE WOOD PILES IN THE FOUNDATION WALLS CAN BE REPAIRED 
THE SPREADING NETWORK OF CANALS SHAPED THE CITY THAT GREW UP AROUND THEM 
HOUSES LINED THE CANALS AND BRIDGES CROSSED THEM 
WATER WOULD DEFINE THE VERY LAYOUT OF THE CITY 
BOTH THE ABUNDANCE OF SALT WATER AND THE NEED FOR FRESH WATER 
HERE IN VENICE WE'RE ALL SURROUNDED BY SALT WATER 
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND FRESH WATER TO DRINK 
SO WHAT DID THEY DECIDE TO DO 
THEY MADE SOME WELLS TO COLLECT RAINWATER AND THEY STORED IT IN UNDERGROUND TANKS 
THESE FOUR PARTS ARE TO FILTER THE WATER IN SAND 
THEY WENT DOWN IN AN UNDERGROUND TANK 
THIS IS THE OLD STONE AND THEN HERE THERE IS THE TANK 
AND THEN ALL AROUND THE WELL THERE WAS THE NORMAL LIFE THERE WAS THE HOUSES THEY WERE LIVING DAY BY DAY 
EACH SQUARE HAD ITS OWN SMALL COMMUNITY 
THEY WERE TIGHTKNIT AND TIGHTLY PACKED 
EACH BRIDGE CROSSED WAS A JOURNEY INTO A DIFFERENT TERRITORY 
THERE WERE FEUDS AND ONE FEUD IN PARTICULAR BETWEEN THE NICOLOTTIS AND THE CASTELLANIS 
THE NICOLOTTIS AND THE CASTELLANIS WERE GANGS 
SWORN RIVALS 
THEY HATED EACH OTHER 
THE HATRED LED TO FIGHTING BLOOD AND DEATH 
THE FIGHTS BECAME KNOWN AS LA GUERRA DEI PUGNI 
THE CASTELLANIS WERE SHIPBUILDERS 
THEY WORE RED HATS AND SCARVES 
THE NICOLOTTIS WERE HARD LIVING FISHERMEN 
THEY WORE BLACK 
CASTELLANI WOMEN WORE FLOWERS ON ONE SIDE OF THEIR BREAST AND THE NICOLOTTI ON THE OTHER BREAST 
BLOOD FEUDS CONTINUED FOR GENERATIONS 
SO VENICE NEEDED STRONG GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE LAW AND ORDER 
IT WAS TO EVOLVE A SYSTEM LIKE NO OTHER IN THE WORLD AND A RULER UNLIKE ANY OTHER 
THE DOGE 
THE DOGE WAS AN ELECTED RULER 
HEAD OF A REPUBLIC NOT A MONARCHY 
HIS DESCENDANTS COULDN'T INHERIT BUT HE DID LIVE IN A PALACE 
THE DOGES' PALACE IS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY BUILDINGS IN THE WORLD 
THERE HAS BEEN A PALACE ON THE SITE FROM THE EARLY NINTH CENTURY 
FROM HERE FOR ALMOST ONE THOUSAND YEARS 
THE DOGE RULED VENICE 
THE PRESENT BUILDING IS A MIX OF GOTHIC AND CLASSICAL EAST AND WEST 
THE MARRIAGE OF STYLES THAT WOULD COME TO DEFINE THE LOOK OF VENICE 
THE DOGE COULD ENJOY A FINE PALACE AT A TIME WHEN OTHER RULERS 
HID THEMSELVES AWAY IN HEAVY MEDIEVAL FORTIFICATIONS 
VENICE WAS BEGINNING TO EXHIBIT THE CONFIDENCE THAT CAME WITH ITS MIRACULOUS LOCATION 
IMPREGNABLE TO ATTACK PROTECTED BY THE LAGOON 
AT THE TOP OF THE GIANT STAIRCASE IN THE PALACE COURTYARD 
ARE THE FIGURES OF NEPTUNE AND MARS THE GODS OF THE SEA 
AND WAR 
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH VENICE HAD TAMED THEM BOTH 
THIS WAS THE ULTIMATE SEAT OF POWER 
THE DOGE PRESIDED OVER THE RULING COUNCIL HERE 
LAWS WERE MADE HERE AND JUSTICE DISPENSED 
EVEN THE STATE PRISON WAS PART OF THE PALACE 
AND AT ITS CENTRE THE DOGE LIVED IN SPLENDOUR 
THIS IS YOUR DOWNING STREET HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT TOWER OF LONDON AND BUCKINGHAM PALACE ROLLED INTO ONE 
THROUGHOUT THE PALACE VENICE IS REPRESENTED AS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN 
IN PAINTING AFTER PAINTING SHE APPEARS WITH CHRIST HIMSELF 
AT TIMES SHE SEEMS TO OUTSHINE EVEN THE SON OF GOD 
THE DOGE TOO IS DEIFIED 
THESE IMAGES FORETELL WHAT VENICE WOULD BECOME PROUD AND ARROGANT 
THE DOGE EVEN APPEARS WITH THE MADONNA 
BUT THAT WAS ALL FAR IN THE FUTURE 
IN THE EARLY DAYS THE DOGE WAS FAR FROM BEING CONSIDERED A GOD 
IN FACT AS WARRING FAMILIES FOUGHT FOR CONTROL OF VENICE 
THE DOGE HAD TROUBLE EVEN STAYING ALIVE 
DOGE TEODATO IPATO CAME TO A TERRIBLE END 
HE WAS BLINDED AND DEPOSED BY HIS SUCCESSOR 
DOGE DOMENICO MONEGARIO 
WAS STABBED TO DEATH IN HIS OWN PALACE 
AND EIGHTY YEAR OLD DOGE PIETRO TRADONICO 
WAS SPRUNG ON BY AN ARMED GANG AND LEFT FOR DEAD 
BUT OVER TIME THINGS IMPROVED 
THIS IS THE GREAT COUNCIL CHAMBER 
HERE THE DOGE PRESIDED OVER MEETINGS WITH THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED REPRESENTATIVES OF VENICE 
THIS ROOM WAS AT THE HEART OF VENETIAN GOVERNMENT 
WHAT WE SEE TODAY IS THE REPLACEMENT TO AN EARLIER HALL BURNT DOWN IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN 
BUT IT REFLECTS THE CONFIDENCE OF EARLY VENICE 
AT THE FAR END IS A HUGE CANVAS BY TINTORETTO 
HIS VISION OF PARADISE 
A BOLD ASSERTION THAT VENETIAN GOVERNMENT COULD MATCH THE DIVINE ORDER ABOVE 
VENICE TRIED SO HARD TO BANISH EARTHLY IMPERFECTIONS 
THAT THE WHOLE PROCESS OF ELECTING A DOGE TURNED INTO A REAL NIGHTMARE 
FIRST NINE MEMBERS WERE CHOSEN BY LOTTERY 
AND THESE NINE HAD TO CHOOSE FORTY MEMBERS OF THE GREAT COUNCIL 
AND EACH OF THESE FORTY MEMBERS HAD TO BE APPROVED BY AT LEAST SEVEN OF THE NINE 
FROM THESE FORTY THEY DREW LOTS AND THEY BECOME TWENTY FIVE 
AND THESE TWENTY FIVE HAVE TO CHOOSE ANOTHER TWELVE 
THE TWELVE DECIDED THEY CHOOSE ANOTHER FORTY FIVE 
AND FROM THE FORTY FIVE THEY ARRIVE TO BE TWELVE SORRY ELEVEN 
ELEVEN 
THESE ELEVEN WERE GOING TO CHOOSE FORTY ONE VOTERS 
AND IT IS THIS FORTY ONE THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE THE ELECTION OF THE DOGE 
IT WAS THAT EASY 
EVEN US VENETIANS DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IT 
BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT IT WORKED I THINK SO 
SO FOR THE TIMES VENICE MADE IMMENSE EFFORTS TO AVOID THE CORRUPTION OF OTHER STATES 
TO STOP POWER FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF ONE DYNASTY 
EVEN ORDINARY PEOPLE COULD HAVE SOME INFLUENCE ON GOVERNMENT 
ALL OVER THE PALACE ARE THESE LETTER BOXES 
INTO THE MOUTH PEOPLE COULD POST PRIVATE ACCUSATIONS 
OF CRIMES COMMITTED AT ANY LEVEL OF SOCIETY 
IT WORKED VENETIANS WERE AMONGST THE MOST LAW ABIDING OF EUROPEANS 
EVEN THE DOGE WAS CHECKED FOR BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION 
EVERY INDULGENCE WAS GRANTED TO THE DOGE 
EXCEPT HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO FOREIGNERS WITHOUT SUPERVISION 
EXCEPT EVERY LETTER HE WROTE EVEN TO HIS WIFE HAD TO PASS BEFORE A CENSOR 
HE COULD RECEIVE GIFTS BUT ONLY FLOWERS ROSE WATER SWEET HERBS AND BALSAM 
SO HE HAD EVERYTHING EXCEPT HIS FREEDOM 
IN THIS ROOM ARE PICTURES OF EVERY DOGE WHO RULED VENICE 
ONLY ONE IS MISSING 
HIDDEN BY A BLACK CLOTH IS THE FACE OF DOGE MARIN FALIER 
THE DOGE WHO TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF KING TO OVERTHROW THE REPUBLIC 
THE PLOT WAS FOILED AND HE WAS BEHEADED ON THE STEPS TO THE PALACE 
THE OFFICE OF THE DOGE BROUGHT TO VENICE ALL THE MAJESTY OF A MONARCHY 
WITHOUT ITS DYNASTIC LIMITATIONS 
IN A WORLD OF MAGNIFICENT COURT RITUAL VENICE WAS UNRIVALLED 
BUT THE CITY LACKED A SPIRITUAL FIGUREHEAD 
SOMETHING ALL POWERFUL CITIES OF THE AGE POSSESSED 
THE RELICS OF A GREAT SAINT TO CALL ITS OWN 
ROME HAD THE BODY OF SAINT PETER AN APOSTLE AND A DIRECT LINK TO CHRIST 
ALL VENICE HAD WAS SAINT THEODORE TRULY A SECOND DIVISION SAINT 
BUT THE VENETIANS BELIEVED THEY HAD A CLAIM ON SOMEONE GREATER 
LOCAL LEGEND CLAIMED THAT THE APOSTLE SAINT MARK BLOWN OFF COURSE INTO THE VENETIAN LAGOON 
HAD SEEN AN ANGEL WHO TOLD HIM ONE DAY HE WOULD BE LAID TO REST THERE 
INSPIRED BY THE LEGEND 
TWO VENETIAN MERCHANTS SLIPPED UNNOTICED INTO THE CRYPT OF A CHURCH IN ALEXANDRIA 
ON THE NORTH COAST OF AFRICA 
THEY WERE THERE TO STEAL ONE OF THE MOST SACRED RELICS OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD 
THE REMAINS OF SAINT MARK THE APOSTLE 
IN THE MEDIEVAL WORLD THE RELICS OF SAINTS 
WHO WERE CLOSE TO CHRIST BROUGHT IN HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY FROM PILGRIMS 
THEY CONFERRED SACRED STATUS ON A CITY AND INSPIRED ARMIES TO FEATS OF MILITARY GLORY 
NEWS OF THE THEFT SPREAD QUICKLY 
ALL THE SHIPS IN THE HARBOUR WERE SEARCHED 
BUT THE MERCHANTS CONCEALED THE BODY OF THE SAINT IN A BASKET UNDER PIECES OF PORK 
AND THE MUSLIM SOLDIERS FLED 
THE AUDACIOUS PLAN HAD SUCCEEDED AND SAINT MARK CAME BACK TO VENICE 
THE CITY HAD A SAINT TO RIVAL EVEN ROME 
AND SOON THE ANCIENT SYMBOL OF SAINT MARK BECAME THE EMBLEM OF VENICE 
THE WINGED LION 
WHEN THE VENETIANS BUILT A CHURCH TO HOUSE THE BODY OF THEIR NEW SAINT 
IT WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNISABLE BUILDINGS IN THE WORLD 
THE BASILICA OF SAINT MARK 
ON THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING A MOSAIC DEPICTS THE BODY ARRIVING FROM ALEXANDRIA 
SAINT MARK'S IS THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT AND RICHLY DECORATED CHURCH IN THE WHOLE OF EUROPE 
BUILT AS THE DOGES' PRIVATE CHAPEL IT TOOK THIRTY YEARS TO COMPLETE 
A MIRACLE OF ENGINEERING FOR THE END OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY 
THOUGH IT HAS BEEN SINKING INTO THE MARSHY GROUND EVER SINCE 
LIKE THE BASILICA OF TORCELLO THE INSPIRATION IS FROM THE EAST 
THE CHURCH IS IN THE FORM OF A GREEK CROSS SUPPORTING FIVE GREAT DOMES 
THE INTERIOR IS DOMINATED BY CHRIST AND HIS DISCIPLES 
IN ALL THERE ARE 
CRAFTED BY VENETIAN ARTISTS OVER SEVERAL CENTURIES 
ABOVE THE ALTAR IS THE PALA D'ORO 
THE GREAT ALTAR SCREEN CREATED BY VENETIAN AND BYZANTINE GOLDSMITHS 
BENEATH THE ALTAR LIES THE TOMB OF SAINT MARK 
THE SACRED HEART OF THE CITY 
BUT THIS PLACE IS MORE THAN AN EXPRESSION OF RELIGIOUS DEVOTION 
FOR IT WAS HERE THAT THE AUTHORITY OF THE DOGE RECEIVED DIVINE SANCTION 
IN THE NAVE SIT TWO GREAT PULPITS 
ONE PULPIT WAS RESERVED FOR RELIGIOUS ADDRESSES 
THE OTHER WAS FOR THE DOGE 
THIS IS WHERE HE WOULD ADDRESS THE PEOPLE OF VENICE 
WHERE HE STOOD TO PROCLAIM VENICE WOULD SUBMIT TO NO ONE 
EMPEROR KING OR POPE 
THE EXTERIOR IS AN EXTRAORDINARY CONFECTION 
VENETIAN ORNAMENT MIXES WITH PRECIOUS OBJECTS FROM OVERSEAS 
IN ONE THOUSAND SEVENTY FIVE THE DOGE HAD PROCLAIMED IT WAS THE DUTY OF EVERY TRAVELLING VENETIAN 
TO BRING TREASURES BACK TO ADORN THE FACADE 
BUT IT IS THE DOMES OF SAINT MARK'S THAT GIVE IT SUCH A MEMORABLE SKYLINE 
THOSE FAMOUS EASTERN LOOKING ONION DOMES WERE PUT ON LATER 
THEY ARE MADE OF WOOD AND COVERED BY LEAD 
THE REAL STONE DOMES MUCH FLATTER AND LESS EYE CATCHING 
ARE HIDDEN UNDERNEATH 
SAINT MARK'S SET THE MOOD FOR VENICE TO BE THE MOST SENSATIONAL STAGE SET THE WORLD HAD EVER SEEN 
ITS RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL CENTREPIECES PROCLAIMED THE CITY'S INDEPENDENCE AND GROWING CONFIDENCE 
ITS PEOPLE HAD TRANSFORMED FROM FISHERMEN INTO MERCHANTS 
NOW MERCHANTS WOULD BECOME PRINCES OF TRADE 
THEIR EARLY WOODEN HOUSES REPLACED BY BRICK AND STONE PALACES 
MODERN VENICE WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE SHAPE 
IT WAS AROUND THIS TIME THAT MY FAMILY BECAME SUCCESSFUL MERCHANTS 
AND DECIDED TO BUILD A GRAND HOUSE 
IT IS THE OLDEST PALAZZO TO SURVIVE ON THE GRAND CANAL 
NOW IT IS ROTTING AND ONE OF THE SADDEST SIGHTS OF THE CITY 
IT BREAKS MY HEART 
THIS PALACE IS CALLED CA'DA MOSTO 
IT WAS BUILT BY MY FAMILY IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY 
AND MY ANCESTORS LIVED HERE NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED YEARS UNTIL ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THREE 
WHEN IT WAS BEQUEATHED TO ANOTHER FAMILY 
I'VE DRIVEN PAST IT A THOUSAND TIMES 
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN INSIDE 
IF I HAVE TO BE SINCERE I'M A LITTLE SHY TO COME INSIDE THIS PLACE 
BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS SEEN THIS HOUSE FROM OUTSIDE 
THE MASK THAT NORMALLY THE PUBLIC SEES 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO ENTER A WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE 
A PLACE YOU KNOW ALL THE PEOPLE OF YOUR FAMILY LIVED OVER MANY CENTURIES 
IT'S QUITE A STRANGE SENSATION 
SOMETHING THAT GIVES YOU A FEELING OF ALL THE HISTORY ON YOUR SHOULDERS 
YOU THINK OF WHO YOU ARE IN THIS MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE 
MY FAMILY DIDN'T JUST LIVE IN THIS HOUSE 
THEY DID BUSINESS HERE 
THEY USED THEIR HOUSE AS A WAREHOUSE A SHOWROOM 
AND A PLACE TO MAKE MONEY AND A LANDING STAGE 
BECAUSE THE MOST PROFITABLE GOODS WERE FROM OVERSEAS 
A SUCCESSFUL MERCHANT HAD TO BE A SAILOR TOO 
WHEN THIS HOUSE WAS FIRST BUILT 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE MODEST BUILDING 
JUST TWO STOREYS HIGH 
BUT IT STOOD AT THE VERY HUB OF THE CITY 
IT WAS HERE THAT MERCHANTS BUILT THEIR BOATS 
READY TO TRAVEL EVER GREATER DISTANCES ACROSS THE SEAS 
THESE MERCHANT SAILORS HAD TO BE READY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES 
THEIR BOATS LOADED WITH VALUABLE GOODS FROM AROUND THE MEDITERRANEAN 
HAD TO FIGHT OFF PIRATES AND FOREIGN RIVALS 
THE VENETIAN MERCHANT TRADERS BECAME FEARED AS THE ABLEST MILITARY SEAMEN OF THE AGE 
TRADE SOMETHING OF A DIRTY WORD IN THE REST OF EUROPE 
WAS A NOBLE OCCUPATION IN VENICE 
AND ONE MERCHANT WOULD BECOME MORE FAMOUS THAN ANY OTHER 
HIS NAME WAS ENRICO DANDOLO 
AND HIS STORY WOULD BECOME LINKED WITH THE FATE OF THE CITY 
IT BEGAN WITH A GROSS ACT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF VENICE 
VIOLENCE THAT WOULD COME FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE 
BY THE TWELFTH CENTURY THE VENETIANS HAD TRADING POSTS ALL OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN 
MOST PROFITABLE OF ALL WERE THE TRADING LINKS WITH BYZANTIUM 
AND IN PARTICULAR ITS CAPITAL CITY OF CONSTANTINOPLE 
BYZANTIUM HAD INFLUENCED EVENTS IN VENICE FOR CENTURIES 
BUT NOW POWER HAD SHIFTED AND VENICE WAS GAINING THE UPPER HAND 
THIS WAS THE OLD VENETIAN QUARTER IN CONSTANTINOPLE 
TEN THOUSAND VENETIANS LIVED AND WORKED HERE 
FIRST THEY WERE INVITED HERE TO TRADE 
BUT SLOWLY THEY WERE TAKING OVER AND GETTING RICH 
THE BYZANTINES WERE NOT HAPPY 
THE BYZANTINE EMPEROR HAD GIVEN THEM PERMISSION TO LIVE IN A CONFINED AREA 
OF WAREHOUSES AND WHARFS BY THE SEA WALL 
BUT MORE AND MORE VENETIAN MERCHANTS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE CITY 
THIS ALL BECAME TOO MUCH FOR THE BYZANTINE AUTHORITIES 
THE VENETIANS WERE BUYING UP THEIR HOUSES AND MARRYING THEIR WOMEN 
AND ON ONE QUIET NIGHT IN MARCH ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE 
SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT WOULD CHANGE THE COURSE OF VENETIAN HISTORY 
AS THE VENETIAN TRADING FAMILIES SAT DOWN TO EAT 
THEY ALL RECEIVED AN UNEXPECTED HOUSE CALL 
IN JUST A FEW DAYS THOUSANDS OF VENETIANS WERE ARRESTED 
STRIPPED OF THEIR POSSESSIONS AND THROWN INTO PRISON 
THE VENETIANS HAD BEEN CAGED BY THEIR TRADING PARTNER 
HUMILIATED THEY COULD DO NOTHING BUT WAIT 
FOR CENTURIES VENICE AND CONSTANTINOPLE HAD BEEN ALLIES 
BUT NOW THEY HAD BECOME THE WORST OF ENEMIES 
NEWS OF THE ARRESTS TRAVELLED FAST TO VENICE 
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THE PEOPLE FELT HERE 
WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THOUSANDS OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS HAD BEEN JAILED IN CONSTANTINOPLE 
BROTHERS FATHERS SONS EVEN MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS HAD ALL BEEN THROWN INTO PRISON 
IT WAS THE GREATEST THREAT TO VENICE SINCE THE CITY HAD RISEN FROM THE SWAMPS OF THE LAGOON 
THE VENETIANS DECIDED TO NEGOTIATE THE RELEASE OF THE PRISONERS 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE MAN FOR THE JOB ENRICO DANDOLO THE GREATEST MERCHANT SEAMAN OF THE AGE 
BUT IT WAS A TRAP 
HE WAS TAKEN PRISONER AND PROBABLY TORTURED 
EITHER THAT OR HE WAS BEATEN UP ON THE STREETS OF CONSTANTINOPLE 
ALL WE KNOW IS WHEN HE GOT BACK TO VENICE HE WAS BLIND 
WE WILL NEVER KNOW THE TRUTH OF HOW ENRICO DANDOLO LOST HIS SIGHT 
BUT ONE FACT WE CAN BE SURE OF EVEN BLINDED STUCK IN HIS PALACE ON THE RIALTO 
HE NEVER ABANDONED THE CAUSE OF THE REPUBLIC 
VENICE HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO HER KNEES 
BYZANTIUM HAD STAMPED ON THE CITY'S GROWING ECONOMY 
AND WIPED OUT HER GREAT TRADING LINKS WITH THE EAST 
BUT THE VENETIANS WERE NOT ABOUT TO GIVE IN 
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT US VENETIANS 
WE REALLY STICK TOGETHER 
LIVING IN THIS LITTLE ISLAND IN THE LAGOON WE HAVE TO HELP EACH OTHER 
EVERY BUILDING IS AN ACHIEVEMENT 
THE VENETIAN CHARACTER IS IN THE BRIDGES 
AND IN THE STONES AROUND ME HERE 
HOW DID VENICE SHOW HER DEFIANCE TO CONSTANTINOPLE 
LET ME SHOW YOU 
WE BUILT THIS SAINT MARK'S SQUARE 
PERHAPS THE WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL URBAN SPACE 
THE SURROUNDING BUILDINGS ARE LATER BUT THE PIAZZA ITSELF 
ITS PROPORTIONS AND SHAPE WAS CREATED IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
PLANNED CLEARED OF OTHER BUILDINGS AND PAVED OVER 
AT THE VERY MOMENT VENICE FACED FINANCIAL RUIN 
TO BUILD THIS SQUARE 
VENETIANS REACHED INTO THEIR OWN POCKETS 
THE MONEY CAME FROM EVERYONE 
FROM THE DOGE TO THE ORDINARY MERCHANT 
FOR MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS THIS SQUARE HAS BEEN A SHOWPIECE OF VENETIAN CIVIC PRIDE 
SWEPT DAILY AT DAWN TO BE IMMACULATE 
WE CARE PASSIONATELY ABOUT THIS OPEN SPACE 
SAINT MARK'S SQUARE WAS TO BE THE FIRST EXAMPLE 
OF VENICE'S POWERS OF DEFIANCE AND RECOVERY 
SYMBOLISED IN GREAT ARCHITECTURE 
AND VENICE HAD CREATED A GREAT STAGE SET FOR ITS CEREMONIAL LIFE 
AN ARENA FOR PAGEANTRY AND CELEBRATION OF THE REPUBLIC 
THE EARLIEST IMAGE OF THE SQUARE FROM ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY SIX SHOWS THE FEAST DAY OF SAINT MARK 
AND IT CAPTURES THE SPIRIT OF RITUAL THAT GREW UP AROUND THE PIAZZA ALMOST AS SOON AS IT WAS BUILT 
MORE THAN ANYTHING THE CREATION OF THIS SQUARE SHOWED ONE THING 
VENICE WOULD NOT BE DEFEATED 
AND ONCE THE SQUARE WAS COMPLETE TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THEIR RESOLVE 
VENICE ELECTED A NEW DOGE 
VENETIANS GREETED HIM WITH ENTHUSIASM 
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS AN OLD MAN AND IT WAS OVER TWENTY YEARS SINCE HE HAD BEEN IN THE PUBLIC EYE 
ENRICO DANDOLO 
WHEN DANDOLO SIGNED HIS OATH OF OFFICE ON FIRST JANUARY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE 
IT BROUGHT TO THE OFFICE OF DOGE THE GREATEST PATRIOT VENICE HAD EVER KNOWN 
IN HIS OATH HE SWORE TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF THE VENETIAN REPUBLIC 
BUT DANDOLO WOULD GO FURTHER 
AT LAST THE VENETIANS HAD FOUND A DOGE WHOSE AMBITION FOR THE CITY WOULD STOP AT NOTHING 
IN ENRICO DANDOLO THEY HAD A MASTER TACTICIAN A BRILLIANT STRATEGIST AND A CONSUMMATE POLITICIAN 
FOR ME TO EXPLAIN IN ENGLISH IS VERY HARD 
AND HE WAS ALWAYS ON THE LOOK OUT TO STRENGTHEN THE VENETIAN REPUBLIC AND ITS TRADING PROSPECTS 
FOR A HUNDRED YEARS CHRISTIAN EUROPE HAD WAGED A WAR AGAINST THE ISLAMIC WORLD 
FOR POSSESSION OF THE HOLY LAND IN PARTICULAR JERUSALEM 
IN THE WEST THESE CAMPAIGNS BECAME KNOWN AS THE CRUSADES 
BUT THE FOURTH CRUSADE OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED ONE WAS SHORT OF SHIPS MANPOWER AND MONEY 
IN APRIL THAT YEAR THE CRUSADERS SAILED INTO THE VENETIAN LAGOON 
TO ASK ENRICO DANDOLO FOR VENETIAN BACKING 
VENICE HAD AVOIDED SERIOUS INVOLVEMENT IN ALL THE PREVIOUS CRUSADES 
BUT NOW DANDOLO SEEMED INTERESTED 
ALL OF CHRISTENDOM WAITED FOR HIS RESPONSE 
LET'S THINK ABOUT IT 
WHAT DID VENICE HAVE TO GAIN FROM A CRUSADE TO JERUSALEM 
WOULD IT MAKE THE POPE HAPPY GOOD 
EVERYBODY WILL LIKE US FINE 
BUT HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT 
BUT DANDOLO AGREED TO HELP 
VENICE WOULD BUILD AND PAY FOR MORE SHIPS AND MORE MEN TO SAIL IN THEM 
IN EXCHANGE HE DEMANDED A HIGH PRICE FIFTY PER CENT OF THE CONQUERED LAND 
IT WAS A HARD BARGAIN 
SUDDENLY IT WAS DANDOLO'S CRUSADE 
THIS WAS OUTRAGEOUS HE WAS HIJACKING THE CRUSADE BUT DANDOLO WASN'T INTERESTED IN JERUSALEM 
HE HAD ANOTHER AIM IN MIND 
DANDOLO'S GALLEON LED THE FLEET OF FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SHIPS OUT OF THE LAGOON 
ON THE MORNING OF THE EIGHTH NOVEMBER ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWO 
AT FIRST EVERYTHING WENT ACCORDING TO THE AGREED PLAN 
BUT THEN DANDOLO CHANGED COURSE 
NO LONGER WAS MUSLIM HELD JERUSALEM THEIR DESTINATION 
THEY WOULD SAIL INSTEAD FOR CHRISTIAN CONSTANTINOPLE 
THE FLEET DROPPED ANCHOR WITH CONSTANTINOPLE IN THEIR SIGHTS 
NOW DANDOLO WOULD PUT THE FINAL TOUCHES TO HIS PLANS FOR REVENGE 
ON THE CITY THAT THIRTY YEARS BEFORE HAD IMPRISONED HIM 
AND SO BRUTALLY DECIMATED THE POPULATION OF VENETIAN TRADERS LIVING WITHIN ITS WALLS 
THE WALLS OF CONSTANTINOPLE 
SURROUNDED THE CITY ON THE LAND SIDE 
AND ALL ALONG THE COAST 
OVER THE CENTURIES THEY HAD REPELLED ATTACKS FROM THE FEROCIOUS BULGARS 
THE BLOODTHIRSTY SARACENS AND EVEN THE VAST ARMY OF THE RUSSIANS 
THE WALLS WERE THE MOST IMPRESSIVE MAN MADE DEFENCES 
OF ANY CITY IN THE WORLD 
THE VENETIANS WOULD LAUNCH THEIR ATTACK FROM THE SEA 
AND FROM THE LAND 
AT THE BASE OF THE WALLS 
THE CRUSADERS FOUGHT WITH BYZANTINE SOLDIERS 
AND ATTEMPTED TO BREAK THE DEFENCES WITH BATTERING RAMS 
THIS WAS BRUTAL 
BARBARIC 
BLOODY 
MURDER 
BUT IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS ONLY ONE ANSWER 
THEY HAD TO GO OVER THE TOP OF THE WALLS 
THE ATTACKERS THREW UP SCALING LADDERS 
BUT THEY WERE EASY PREY FOR THE BYZANTINE FORCES 
AND NOW A STORM WAS BLOWING UP 
THE VENETIAN SHIPS WERE BEING SMASHED AGAINST EACH OTHER 
THE BATTLE WAS TURNING AGAINST THEM 
IT WAS THEN THAT ONE ACT OF MAD DESPERATION TURNED THE DAY 
A MAN LEFT TO PLANT THE VENETIAN FLAG ON THE SHORE 
IT WAS THE DOGE ENRICO DANDOLO 
THIS ROUSED THE VENETIANS FOR ONE LAST GREAT ATTACK 
THEY TIED THEIR SHIPS IN PAIRS AND BUILT TOWERS ON THE DECKS 
FROM THE TOWERS THEY LASHED WOODEN PLANKS TOGETHER AS BRIDGES ONTO THE RAMPARTS 
THE ATTACKERS HAD MADE IT OVER THE WALLS AND INTO THE CITY 
ONCE INSIDE THE CITY WALLS THE VENETIANS SPARED NO ONE 
THEY MURDERED OLD AND YOUNG 
THEY RAPED WOMEN 
GIRLS NUNS 
DESECRATED CHURCHES 
THEY TORCHED THE CITY 
THIS WAS A SHAMEFUL VICTORY FOR THE VENETIANS 
AND IN THE GREAT CHURCH OF HAGIA SOPHIA NOW A MOSQUE 
LIES THE TOMB OF THE MAN WHO ENGINEERED IT ALL 
HE CHANGED THE ENTIRE COURSE OF VENETIAN HISTORY 
AND THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD 
BUT NOW ALMOST NO ONE VISITS HIS TOMB 
DOGE ENRICO DANDOLO 
NEVER MADE IT BACK TO VENICE 
BUT WHAT HE SENT HOME WOULD ENRICH MY CITY 
AND WOULD CHANGE EUROPE FOR CENTURIES TO COME 
THE CRUSADERS HAD DESTROYED SO MANY TREASURES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD 
AND WHAT THE VENETIANS SAVED 
THEY SAVED ONLY FOR THEIR OWN PROFIT 
THE VALUE OF GOODS AND MONEY SHIPPED BACK TO VENICE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CALCULATE 
GOLD SILVER AND JEWELS IN IMMENSE QUANTITIES 
THE BASILICA OF SAINT MARK'S BECAME THE GREATEST ROBBERS' DEN IN THE WORLD 
AN ALADDIN'S CAVE OF STOLEN BOOTY AND PLUNDERED TREASURE 
THE OPULENT ALTAR SCREEN THE PALA D'ORO WAS RE EMBELLISHED WITH JEWELS STOLEN FROM CONSTANTINOPLE 
ON THE OUTSIDE THE VENETIANS PROUDLY DISPLAYED MORE STOLEN TREASURE 
GREAT COLUMNS IN FINEST MARBLE 
THESE FOURTH CENTURY ROMAN EMPERORS ARE CARVED OUT OF PORPHYRY 
AND ORIGINALLY CAME FROM EGYPT 
BUT THE CROWNING GLORY FROM CONSTANTINOPLE WAS THE FOUR GREAT BRONZE HORSES 
THEIR ORIGINS ARE LOST IN THE MISTS OF TIME 
BUT LEGEND HAS IT ONCE THEY STOOD IN CORINTH 
TESTIMONY TO THE ARTISTIC GENIUS OF ANCIENT GREECE 
THE STATUES WERE MORE ARTISTICALLY BRILLIANT 
THAN ANYTHING VENICE HAD EVER DREAMED OF 
A SHINING EXAMPLE THAT VENETIAN ARTISTS WOULD NOW SEEK TO EMULATE 
THEY WERE SYMBOLS OF A NEW ERA FOR VENICE 
VENICE STOOD ON THE BRINK OF ITS GOLDEN AGE 
RICHER AND MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER BEFORE 
IT WOULD BECOME HOME 
TO SOME OF THE MOST BRILLIANT ARTISTS AND ARCHITECTS 
THE WORLD HAD EVER SEEN
