LET'S TAKE IT NICE AND EASY 
THE KINGS OF COOL ARE THE ICONS OF TWENTIETH CENTURY MUSICAL SOPHISTICATION 
THESE GUYS ARE COOL 
THEY GOT GIRLS AND WENT TO PARTIES 
YOU WANT STYLISH THEY'VE GOT IT 
YOU WANT HIP DITTO AND SONGS THEY'VE GOT SONGS FOREVER 
IT MAKES YOU FEEL COOLER 
THEY TALKED ABOUT EMOTION THEN DRANK JACK DANIELS BETWEEN TAKES 
THESE GUYS SANG THE SOUNDTRACK TO THE AMERICAN CENTURY 
TO GO HOME FROM WORK AND PUT ON A NICE RECORD 
AND TO LET IT TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE NICE AND NON VIOLENT AND TO GIVE YOU SOME HOPE 
THEY KNEW HOW TO MIX A DRINK 
HOW TO TREAT A DAME AND HOW TO HOLD A TUNE 
THESE ARE SONGS FOR SWINGING LOVERS 
THIS IS MUSIC TO WATCH GIRLS BY 
YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW WHO YOU ARE YOU'RE HOT 
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE WERE GOING CRAZY AT A SEVENTY YEAR OLD GUY 
THE BOYS USED TO TRY AND GET BUSY WITH THE GIRLS WHO WOULD SAY I WANT TO LISTEN TO SINATRA 
MAGNIFICENT THESE ARE THE CROONERS THE KINGS OF COOL 
COME FLY WITH ME 
LET'S FLOAT DOWN TO PERU 
IN LAMA LAND 
THERE'S A ONE MAN BAND 
AND HE'LL TOOT HIS FLUTE FOR YOU 
COME FLY WITH ME 
LET'S TAKE OFF IN THE BLUE 
BING CROSBY WAS THE FATHER OF CROONING 
BORN IN NINETEEN OH THREE IN ILLINOIS THE HEART OF MIDDLE AMERICA 
HE WAS A LITTLE GUY BUT HE WROTE THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE GREAT AMERICAN SONGBOOK 
WELL I THINK I KNOW IT 
DAD DID CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE SANG WHAT THEY DID BEFORE WAS DIFFERENT 
FROM WHAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO 
BING HAD THAT DEEP RICH VOICE GOD HAD GIVEN HIM 
HE SCOOPED THE NOTES A LOT 
DE E. E. 
B. A. DE DI DE DE E. E. D. A. D. A. D. A. A A 
PRESLEY WAS INVENTIVE AND FRESH BING CROSBY WAS THE SAME 
OH GIVE ME A HOME 
HE'S NOW BEST REMEMBERED AS THE GRANDFATHERLY GOLFING SIDEKICK TO BOB HOPE 
BUT HE HELPED TO INVENT POP MUSIC AS WE KNOW IT TODAY 
BUT AS A YOUNG MAN BING WAS MORE INTERESTED IN BOOZE AND BROADS THAN HIS VOICE 
IN THE EARLY YEARS BING WAS QUITE A GADABOUT HE DRANK INTO OBLIVION 
HE WOULD WAKE UP UNDER TABLES IN BARS AND IN THE BEDS OF WOMEN 
WHOSE NAMES HE COULDN'T REMEMBER 
I'VE GOT THE SONG THAT I SING 
I FOUND LETTERS OF HIS EXPERIENCES TRAVELLING WITH THE BAND 
EXPLAINING WHY HE WASN'T SENDING MORE MONEY HOME 
HE WAS TELLING HIS MOTHER HE WAS SPENDING MONEY ON DECENT FOOD 
BUT IT WAS SPEND ON DECENT WHISKEY 
IT WAS WHILE SINGING HOT JAZZ WITH THE RHYTHM BOYS THAT HE DISCOVERED RADIO 
IT WOULD CHANGE HIS VOCAL STYLE AND PUT HIM INTO EVERY FRONT PARLOUR IN AMERICA 
HE WAS THE PERSON WHO CAME INTO YOUR LIVING ROOM THROUGH THE WIRELESS 
FILLED THE ROOM AND FELT LIKE A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY 
HE WAS A HUGE SUCCESS BUT MADE IT ALL SEEM SO EASY 
HE CONQUERED RADIO THEN THE WORLD 
HE WAS EVERYWHERE THREE MOVIES A YEAR FORTY RECORDS A YEAR 
AN HOUR LONG RADIO SHOW LIVE 
NOBODY WAS IN ALL THESE FIELDS SIMULTANEOUSLY AND AT THE TOP OF EACH ONE 
IT DIDN'T REALLY HIT ME FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW FAMOUS HE WAS UNTIL SCHOOL IN THE FIRST GRADE 
A BUNCH OF KIDS WHISPERED AND POINTED AT ME THE LEADER COMES OVER 
AND SAYS SO WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE RELATED TO BING CROSBY 
MAN AND MUSIC WERE SEAMLESS 
BING'S CALM AND RELAXED TAKE ON LIFE FITTED THE GENTLE STYLE OF HIS SONGS PERFECTLY 
HIGH ON THE LIST 
OF BEAUTIFUL SOUNDS 
THE STABILITY AND EXPERIENCE BING EVOKED THROUGH HIS SONGS 
WAS JUST WHAT AMERICA NEEDED AS IT SUFFERED THE DEPRESSION AND WAR 
WE'RE OFF ON THE ROAD TO MOROCCO 
THIS TAXI IS TOUGH ON THE SPINE 
FOR ALL THE COMEDY CROONING CAME FIRST ESPECIALLY AT CHRISTMAS 
I'M DREAMING OF A WHITE CHRISTMAS 
WE'VE ALL GROWN UP WITH A RECORD INDUSTRY TRADITION OF STARTING IN OCTOBER 
YOU GET HOLIDAY SONGS 
THIS IS A TRADITION THAT CROSBY INVENTED ACCIDENTALLY 
AND MAY ALL YOUR CHRISTMASES 
WHEN DAD HEARD IRVING BERLIN PLAYING WHITE CHRISTMAS HE WENT 
IRVING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT ONE HE JUST KNEW 
IT REPRESENTS CHRISTMAS FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE IT'S A PIECE OF MAGIC 
MAY YOUR DAYS BE MERRY AND BRIGHT 
THE RECORD WENT OFF THE MAP BEST SELLING RECORD OF ALL TIME EVEN TODAY 
IT WAS IN THE CHARTS AT CHRISTMAS FOR SIXTEEN OUT OF THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS 
THERE'S NO OTHER RECORD IN THAT BALL PARK HE BECAME FATHER CHRISTMAS 
AS FATHER CHRISTMAS BING GIFTED HIS MIDAS TOUCH 
TO A NEW GENERATION OF CROONERS STEPPING OUT OF THE SHADOWS 
LED BY FRANK SINATRA 
BING ALWAYS SEEMS IN CHARGE 
SINATRA WHO'S AT THE PEAK OF HIS CAREER PROFESSIONALLY SEEMS THE CALLOW GUY TRYING TO FIND HIS ROLE 
YOU WANNA SING HUH I THINK NOT A BAD IDEA NOW YOU MENTION IT I THOUGHT SOMEBODY OUGHT TO 
FRANK IS IN YOUR FACE AND OUT THERE 
AND DAD WAS THE ANTITHESIS OF THAT 
IS THERE A POSSIBILITY OF LATCHING ONTO A FEW BROADS IN THIS TOWN 
IN TERMS OF SINGING STYLES FRANK WAS UPFRONT 
SAYING HE HAD LEARNED FROM DAD TO GREAT EFFECT 
IT'S GREAT AH IT'S GREAT IT'S GRAND SO GRAND 
IT'S WO O. O. O. ONDERLAND 
DOESN'T HOLD A CANDLE TO MY DAD 
LIKE B. A. B. A. RHUM B. A. B. A. B. A. BHUM 
DON'T DIG THAT KIND OF CROONIN' CHUM 
YOU MUST BE ONE OF THE NEWER FELLAS 
THEY WERE AFRAID TO PUT SINATRA OPPOSITE CROSBY BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD KILL HIS CAREER 
IT'S AFTER THAT YOU SEE ONE GOING UP AND ONE GOING INTO SEMI RETIREMENT 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BING CROSBY 
BING SLIPPED NATURALLY INTO THE SEMI RETIREMENT HIS SONGS HAD CELEBRATED 
IT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED DAYS WORK A YEAR WHEN I'M NOT WORKING I'M FISHING GOLFING SHOOTING 
I USED TO FIT RECREATION IN WITH THE WORK 
NOW I JUST FIT THE WORK IN AROUND THE RECREATION 
IT'S A PLEASURE TO PLAY WITH BING AND THE BOYS 
BING EVEN DIED APPROPRIATELY ON THE GOLF COURSE AFTER EIGHTEEN HOLES 
BING COLLAPSED AND DIED WALKING FROM THE EIGHTEENTH HOLE TO THE CLUB HOUSE 
HE'D JUST COMPLETED A STRENUOUS FORTY FIVE HOUR ROUND OF GOLF 
BUT BING CROSBY DIED A HAPPY MAN 
HIS FINAL WORDS AFTER A WINNING LAST ROUND THAT'S A GREAT GAME OF GOLF FELLAS 
I'LL BE SEEING YOU 
BUT HE WASN'T LEFT TO REST IN PEACE 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE HIS ELDEST SON GARY WROTE A DAMNING ACCOUNT OF LIFE WITH BING 
FULL OF ACCUSATIONS OF BEATINGS AND MENTAL CRUELTY 
IT CLOUDED THE MEMORY OF BING FOR YEARS TO COME 
WHEN I KNEW AT NOON THAT I WAS GOING TO GET BEAT THAT NIGHT HEAR THAT DOOR SLAM AT SIX O'CLOCK 
AND THE NEXT THING I'D HEAR WAS MY NAME CALLED THAT WAITING DROVE ME FRUITCAKE 
GARY WAS A VERY ANGRY MAN 
WITH THE BOOK THE BEST WAY TO SELL IT WAS AS A DADDIE DEAREST BOOK SO THEY DID 
THE REALITY IS THE BOOK WAS MOSTLY ABOUT GARY IT WASN'T ABOUT MY DAD 
GARY LIVED A TROUBLED LIFE AND HE WAS INSANELY JEALOUS OF HIS FATHER 
THOSE WHO KNEW THEM BOTH KNEW IT WAS NONSENSE AND DISMISSED IT AS SUCH 
UNFORTUNATELY THINGS LIKE THAT CAN DEVELOP SOME TRACTION 
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T EVEN READ THE BOOK HAVE THAT IMPRESSION IT'S HARD TO DISPEL IT 
WHILE THEY HEARD SOMEWHERE THAT NOWADAYS IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT HE WAS AN ABUSIVE FATHER 
IT'S ALL NONSENSE 
PEACE ON EARTH 
DESPITE THIS HINT OF NOTORIETY 
BING WILL ALWAYS BE MR. CLEAN HE MADE THE WILDEST TALENT SEEM SAFE 
SEE THE DAY OF GLORY FINEST GIFTS WE BRING PA RAM PAM PAM PAM 
HE'S BEEN WRITTEN OUT OF HISTORY THE STABILITY THAT GOT US THROUGH THE DEPRESSION AND W. W. I. I. 
WASN'T APPEALING TO YOUNGER PEOPLE 
NOW THERE'S A NEW GENERATION COMING UP AND THAT STOLIDITY BECOMES GRANDFATHERLY AND REMOTE 
AND HE NO LONGER SEEMS RELEVANT 
CAN IT BE 
BING WORKED WITH MOST OF THE MAJOR MUSIC TALENTS OF HIS TIME 
ONE OF THEM WAS HUNGRY TO REPLACE HIM AS THE VOICE OF THE CENTURY 
FRANK SINATRA 
LUCK BE A LADY BY FRANK SINATRA 
LUCK BE A LADY TONIGHT 
HE WOULD SING AND YOU KNEW IT WAS FRANK FROM THE WORDS 
HIS PHRASING WAS FLAWLESS 
LUCK IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN A LADY TO BEGIN WITH 
LUCK BE A LADY TONIGHT 
FRANCIS ALBERT SINATRA WAS BORN IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN ACROSS THE RIVER FROM NEW YORK 
FROM AN EARLY AGE HE WANTED TO BE A SINGER AND HE LOOKED THE PART 
HIS FAMILY WEREN'T RICH BUT MOTHER DOLLY GAVE HIM A HEAD START 
HIS MOTHER BOUGHT HIM AN EARLY AMPLIFIER 
IT WAS A RARITY IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THIRTY SIXTHS 
TO SING AT A DANCE WITH A MICROPHONE IT'S AN ADVANTAGE FOR A SINGER 
NIGHT AND DAY 
FRANK MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF 
AS A VOCALIST IN THE DANCE BAND ERA OF THE EARLY FORTIES 
IN TIME HONOURED FASHION IT WAS WHEN HE WENT SOLO THAT THINGS TOOK OFF 
TRIGGERED BY A RESIDENCY AT NEW YORK'S PARAMOUNT THEATRE 
THE YOUNG SINATRA SHOT TO FAME AMID UNPRECEDENTED SCENES OF ADORATION 
IT'S GANGWAY FOR THAT FIRST ROLE WITH POLICEMEN ON HAND 
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER HE WAS THE FIRST TEENY BOPPER IDOL 
THEY CAME TO SEE FRANK SINATRA 
IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING FROM 
IF THEY DIDN'T GET IN RIGHT AWAY THEY'D CRY 
A LITTLE RAIN NEVER STOPPED A TRUE SWOONATRA FAN 
THEY REFERRED TO HIM AS SWOONATRA 
THEY REFERRED TO THE GIRLS AS BOBBY SOXERS 
LISTEN TO THIS CROWD AS FRANKIE MAKES HIS ENTRANCE 
IT WAS SUCH A LOOPY IDEA NOBODY COULD CONCEIVE THAT GIRLS WOULD SHRIEK SCREAM AND FAINT 
SATURDAY NIGHT IS THE LONELIEST NIGHT OF THE WEEK 
I SING A SONG THAT I SANG FOR THE MEMORIES I USUALLY SEE 
HE WAS SO EXCITING UNTIL I HEAR YOU AT THE DOOR 
UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS ONCE MORE 
SATURDAY NIGHT IS THE LONELIEST 
HE'D SING TO PEOPLE IN THE FIRST SECOND ROW 
THEN HE WOULD WORK THE WHOLE ROOM 
HE HAD A WAY TO BE SO SMOOTH 
THAT'S WHY EVERY WOMAN DID FEEL HE SANG TO HER AND WISHED HE WAS 
UNTIL I HEAR YOU AT THE DOOR 
UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS ONCE MORE 
SATURDAY NIGHT IS THE LONELIEST NIGHT OF THE WEEK 
FRANK'S REIGN AS A TEEN IDOL WAS SHORT LIVED 
AS THE FORTIES MOVED INTO THE FIFTIES HIS CAREER TOOK A NOSE DIVE 
HIS MATINEE IDOL IMAGE WAS TARNISHED BY REPORTS CONNECTING HIM WITH MAFIA BOSS SAM GIANCANA 
HE DENIED IT AND TRIED TO AVOID THAT IMAGE 
BUT HE WAS THERE AND THEY WERE THERE FOR HIM 
IT BECAME CLEAR THAT SINATRA WAS NOT THIS WIDE EYED INNOCENT VIRGINAL TYPE 
IN DIRECT CONTRAST WITH HIS MUSIC 
FRANK'S BOBBY SOXER FANS DESERTED HIM RECORD SALES PLUMMETED 
HE WAS BUMPED BY HIS RECORD LABEL 
HE WAS GONE NOBODY WOULD TOUCH HIM 
HIS PERSONAL LIFE SUFFERED TOO 
HIS MARRIAGE COLLAPSED HE MOVED OUT OF HIS HOME 
BECOMING ESTRANGED FROM HIS WIFE AND KIDS 
HE DID SAY ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE NOT TO CARE IF YOU WAKE UP 
HE HAD TO HAVE BEEN VERY DOWN 
WHEN NOBODY WANTED HIM CAPITOL RECORDS PAID PEANUTS FOR AN OLDER SEASONED FRANK 
IT'S QUARTER TO THREE 
NO ONE IN THE PLACE 
CEPT YOU AND ME 
SO SET 'EM UP JOE 
I GOT A LITTLE STORY 
HE USED TO SOUND LIKE A BOY LIKE A MATINEE IDOL 
HE TURNED INTO AN INSTRUMENT 
WE'RE DRINKING MY FRIENDS 
TO THE END 
HE ALSO HAD EMOTION HE'D SING LIKE HIS HEART WAS ABOUT TO FALL OUT 
HE WOULD SING LIKE IT WAS HIS LAST 
MAKE IT ONE FOR MY BABY 
AND ONE MORE FOR THE ROAD 
TO GET THE BEST OUT OF THE MATURE SINATRA 
CAPITOL PUT HIM IN THE STUDIO WITH NELSON RIDDLE 
YOU MAKE ME FEEL SO YOUNG 
RIDDLE TRANSFORMED THE SINATRA SOUND 
IT WAS THE BIRTH OF THE CLASSIC COOL FRANK 
IT'S RICH THE MELODIES ARE RICH 
THE CHORD PROGRESSIONS ARE RICH THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE RICH 
I WANNA GO PLAY 
THE WAY FRANK DELIVERS THIS PUNCHY QUICK SOUND 
IT'S LIKE A LEAD TRUMPET THE DELIVERY'S STRONG AND INSTANT 
FRANK WOULD LEAVE GAPS AND PAUSES 
YOU MAKE ME FEEL SO YOUNG 
YOU MAKE ME FEEL SO YOUNG 
YOU MAKE ME FEEL THERE ARE SONGS TO BE SUNG 
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHEN HE'D DELIVER THE LINE 
I'VE GOT YOU 
UNDER MY SKIN 
I'VE GOT YOU 
DEEP IN THE HEART OF ME 
IF FRANK SOUNDED LIKE HE'D EXPERIENCED A BIT MORE OF LIFE 
IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD 
NEVER MORE SO THAN IN HIS TEMPESTUOUS MARRIAGE TO AVA GARDNER 
THEY ALL WORSHIPPED THE FACE THE FAME THE FIGURE 
OF THE WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL ACTRESS' 
THIS AFFAIR IT NEVER WILL GO SO WELL 
AVA WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD 
AND SHE JUST BLEW SHE STOLE HIS HEART MAN 
HE WAS LIKE A BOY AROUND HER ALL THE TIME 
SHE WAS WONDERFUL BUT THEY COULDN'T GET ALONG WELL 
THEY WOULD FIGHT LIKE CATS AND DOGS 
THEY WERE TWO PEOPLE WITH BIG EMOTIONS 
THEY CONSUMED EACH OTHER 
IT REPEATS IT REPEATS IN MY EAR 
IT WAS A LONG DRAWN OUT THING THAT CAME AND WENT IN SPURTS 
THEY WOULD BREAK UP AND GET TOGETHER AGAIN AND BREAK UP 
COULDN'T HANDLE THEIR LOVE AFFAIRS 
THEY WERE TWO VERY SOUGHT AFTER PEOPLE 
JUST THE THOUGHT OF YOU MAKES ME STOP JUST BEFORE I BEGIN 
BECAUSE I'VE GOT YOU 
UNDER MY SKIN 
AND YOU GRAB ME 
UNDER MY SKIN 
WHEN FRANK'S MARRIAGE TO AVA HIT THE ROCKS THE BACHELOR OF COOL DIDN'T HOLD BACK 
SINATRA CONSOLED HIMSELF BY INDULGING IN HIS FAVOURITE PASTIME WOMEN 
HE COULD CHARM WOMEN LIKE A CAT WOULD CHARM A BIRD 
HE STARED WITH THEM BLUE EYES AND THEY'D GO RIGHT THROUGH YOU IT WAS LIKE A MAGIC RAY 
NOBODY COULD LOOK AT YOU AND SAY HI BABY THE WAY HE DID 
THEY HAD WOMEN AROUND ALL THE TIME 
HE'D SIT THERE AND GO I WANT THAT ONE 
YOU'D SEE THEM GETTING UP OH HI FRANCIS 
I REMEMBER GOING IN HIS BEDROOM HE WAS TAKING A SHOWER 
I LAID THE CLOTHES OUT 
HE CAME OUT THE SHOWER AND I SAID MY GOD I NEVER KNEW A WHITE BOY THAT HAD A SCHLONG THAT LONG 
HE SAID GET OUT I SAID WHAT DO YOU USE ON IT OLIVE OIL 
PER PIACERE DI PRESENTAR VI FRANK SINATRA CHE QUESTA SERA VI CANTARE COME FLY WITH ME 
COME FLY WITH ME WE'LL FLY WE'LL FLY AWAY 
THE MAN WHO BECAME KNOWN AS THE VOICE INVENTED THE INTERNATIONAL PLAYBOY LIFESTYLE 
CHAMPAGNE SMOKE FILLED LOUNGES AND PRIVATE JETS 
LIFE WITH FRANK IS GREAT 
YOU KNOW COME ON LET'S SPLIT WE'LL DO THIS AND THAT 
IN LAMA LAND THERE'S A ONE MAN BAND 
AND HE'LL TOOT HIS FLUTE FOR YOU 
HE MADE FLYING FROM NEW YORK TO BUENOS AIRES COOL AFTER LUNCH 
ONCE I GET YOU UP THERE 
WHERE THE AIR IS RAREFIED 
IT'S NOT HERE'S A SONG HERE'S ANOTHER ONE 
I'VE LIVED IT THIS IS HOW I INTERPRET LIFE 
I'LL BE HOLDING YOU SO VERY NEAR 
WITH FRANK THE ONE THING 
IS THAT HIS SINGING TALENT WAS EQUAL TO HIS PERSONALITY 
OR TO HIS PERSONA 
THE KING OF COOL HAD A COURT THE RAT PACK 
HIS JESTER WAS THE MAN THEY CALLED DEANO 
YOU COULD ONLY BE FRANK'S FRIEND IF YOU UNDERSTOOD HE WAS BOSS 
FRANK ASKED ME TO COME OVER HE TOLD ME TO COME HERE 
UNCLE FRANK WAS A FANTASTIC INCREDIBLE MAN I LOVED HIM 
BUT HE WAS MORE INTENSE 
DAD WAS MORE LAIDBACK AND EASY AND LET THINGS GO BY 
WHEN YOU'RE SMILING OH YEAH 
WHEN YOU SMILE OH BABY 
OH THE WHOLE WORLD WORLD 
IT SMILES WITH YOU 
WHEN YOU PUT THE TWO GUYS TOGETHER ON A STAGE 
IF YOU WATCH YOU'LL BE TRANSFIXED FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS 
YOU'RE SORT OF MESMERISED BY FRANK 
THEN AFTER THIRTY SECONDS 
YOUR EYE STARTS MOVING AWAY FROM FRANK AND ALL OF A SUDDEN 
YOU CAN'T KEEP YOUR EYES OFF DEAN 
WHEN YOU'RE CRYING BABY YOU BRING ON THE RAIN BRING IT ON 
SO STOP YOUR SIGHING STOP YOUR SIGHING 
BE HAPPY BE HAPPY AGAIN 
FRANK CAN BE CUTE DEAN IS FUNNY BIG TIME FUNNY 
YOU WANTED TO GIGGLE WITH HIM 
OH THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
YOU HAD TO KNOW HIS SENSE OF HUMOUR JUST THIS MORNING WE FLEW IN 
WE DIDN'T EVEN TAKE THE AEROPLANE WE JUST FLEW RIGHT IN 
DEAN JUST SAID THINGS FUNNY 
THIS AIN'T GOT NO PRINTING ON IT AT ALL 
WANNA GO ANY PLACE 
HE SET A VIBE AN ATMOSPHERE 
ANY TIME YOU'RE READY BOY 
HE JUST HAD A STYLE AND HE WAS JUST SO COOL TO BE AROUND 
TRAILER FOR SALE OR RENT 
ROOM TO LET FIFTY CENTS 
NO PHONES NO POOLS NO PETS 
AIN'T GOT NO CIGARETTES 
FIGURE OUT WHAT COOL IS AND THAT'S WHAT HE WAS 
HE WAS THE COOLEST CUTEST CAT THAT EVER LIVED 
I'M A MAN OF MEAN BY NO MEANS 
KING OF THE ROAD 
PEOPLE SAY IT LOOKED EFFORTLESS I HAVE A FEELING THAT IT WAS 
WHEN HE SANG 
ALL I DO IS DREAM OF YOU 
THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH 
ALL I DO IS DREAM OF YOU 
THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH 
WHERE THE DAWN IS STILL 
WHERE BING HAD THE CARDIGAN AND THE PIPE AND FRANK WAS OLD BLUE EYES 
DEAN'S SIGNATURE WAS A TUMBLER OF SCOTCH ON THE ROCKS 
HE WAS NEVER SEEN WITHOUT A DRINK 
NEVER HAD BEING LOADED BEEN SO COOL 
OH DON'T BE NERVOUS FOLKS 
DEAN JUST FELL IN THE WINE CELLAR 
AND HERE HE IS DIRECT FROM THE BAR DEAN MARTIN 
THERE WAS DEFINITELY A PERIOD IN THE SIXTIES WHEN HE WAS NEVER ON CAMERA WITHOUT A DRINK IN HIS HAND 
HE WAS BANGED UP BY THE END HE WAS LIKE AND ANOTHER THING 
HOW CAN YOU CALL YOURSELF A DOCTOR BOOZED UP ALL THE TIME 
YOU OUGHTA PUT A STOP TO THAT I'LL DRINK TO THAT 
WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE DRINK SCOTCH AND SODA 
EVERYBODY SMOKED AND DRANK IT WAS AS NATURAL AS EATING LUNCH 
A MARGARITA 
EVERYBODY DRANK A MARTINI 
IN CONTROL BUT JUST A LITTLE OFF IS VERY APPEALING 
THIS IS ONLY A GAG I DON'T DRINK ANY MORE 
I FREEZE IT NOW AND EAT IT LIKE A POPSICLE 
PEOPLE SAID THAT'S DEAN MARTIN HE'S DRUNK BUT IT WAS AN ACT 
THERE WAS APPLE JUICE IN THAT GLASS 
IT WAS ALWAYS APPLE JUICE IN THAT GLASS 
I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU PEOPLE THAT DON'T DRINK 
WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING THAT'S AS GOOD AS YOU'RE GONNA FEEL ALL DAY 
THE GREATEST CONTRADICTION WAS BETWEEN THE PERSONA I WAS PROJECTING 
ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN FOR HIM AND WHAT REALLY WENT ON 
WHEN MARIMBA RHYTHMS START TO PLAY 
DANCE WITH ME 
MAKE ME SWAY 
DEAN'S WHOLE LIFE WAS A CONTRADICTION TO HIS IMAGE 
HE ENJOYED A DRINK BUT WASN'T A DRUNK 
HE WAS A HOME LOVING GUY HAPPILY MARRIED AND THERE FOR HIS CHILDREN 
HE LOVED HIS KIDS AND HANGING AROUND THE HOUSE 
WE WOULD GO SWIMMING HORSEBACK RIDING MOTORCYCLE RIDING 
HE WAS A FAMILY MAN 
HEY MAMBO 
MAMBO ITALIANO 
HEY MAMBO 
MAMBO ITALIANO 
GO GO GO 
YOU MIXED UP SICILIANO 
ALL YOU CALABRESE DO THE MAMBO LIKE A CRAZY 
AS FAR AS THE PARTY AND THE GOING GOING GOING IT WAS ALWAYS FRANK 
FRANK JUST LOVED IT 
DEAN WOULDN'T STAY UP ALL NIGHT 
HE'D JUST HAVE A FEW DRINKS HE'D BE UP AT SIX HITTING GOLF BALLS 
DON'T TOUCH A DIAL 
KEEP IT RIGHT WHERE IT'S AT 
THERE'S SOMETHING BIG 
FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTED TO PLAY GOLF 
HANG OUT WITH HIS KIDS AND STAY SUCCESSFUL DEANO FOUND THE PERFECT SOLUTION 
THE DEAN MARTIN T. V. SHOW IT GOT FIFTY MILLION VIEWERS AND REQUIRED MINIMAL EFFORT 
COOL 
DID HE REHEARSE NEVER WHICH WAS THE FUN OF THE SHOW 
WHENEVER I WATCH YOU ON TELEVISION YOU ALWAYS PRETEND TO BE SO DUMB YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
YEAH I'M NOT PRETENDING I REALLY AM DUMB 
HE WOULD WATCH IT ONCE AND THEN DO IT 
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT 
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE DUMB LIKE ME 
HE DIDN'T CARE IF HE MADE A MISTAKE 
WHAT'LL IT BE 
I'LL HAVE THE USUAL A GLASS OF MILK 
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS MY CUE CARD RIGHT HERE 
WE LEFT THE MISTAKES IN 
MERE ALCOHOL 
DON'T 
SHE MADE THE MISTAKE I DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE 
DAD WAS FUN AND PLAYFUL 
YOU LOVED IT THAT'S WHAT THE SHOW WAS ABOUT 
WELL YOU'RE OFF O. K. 
COME ON LET'S DO IT AGAIN 
IT'S ALL RIGHT SWEETHEART 
IT'LL JUST COME OUT OF YOUR CHEQUE 
WHAT WE'RE SHOWING IS AN IMPERFECT PERFECT PERFORMER 
WHEN YOU'RE SMILING BABE 
THE WHOLE WORLD 
SMILES WITH YOU 
IT SEEMED DEAN WAS SO LAIDBACK HE WAS HORIZONTAL 
FOR OTHER CROONERS THEIR COOL CAME WITH A CATCH 
AND NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE KING COLE TRIO 
I JUST WANT TO HANG OUT AND HAVE A COUPLE OF DRINKS WITH THESE GUYS 
ASK NAT HOW HE DOES THAT TRILL THING WITH HIS FINGER 
GOT A BEAUTIFUL TOUCH 
VERY QUICK SMART MELODIC 
AS A YOUNG BOY NAT'S FAMILY MOVED FROM ALABAMA TO CHICAGO 
NAT LEARNT PIANO WITH THE HIGH SCHOOL JAZZ BAND 
HIS GENIUS WAS SPOTTED AND NAT AND HIS TRIO WERE SOON SIGNED TO CAPITOL RECORDS 
NAT WAS A VERY VERY FINE JAZZ PIANIST 
WHEN I GOT TO CAPITOL 
WE INCLUDED ONE VOCAL IN AN ALBUM HE DID IT WAS MARVELLOUS 
WE SAID NAT YOU SHOULD BE A SINGER HE SAID I'M NOT A SINGER 
I'M JUST A SHY GUY 
BUT ONCE HE STARTED CROONING 
THOSE VOCAL CHORDS MADE AN UNFORGETTABLE SOUND 
HIS WHOLE TONE WAS SO RICH SO RICH 
ONE KIND OF AH FROM HIM WOULD BE LIKE A SLICE OF CHOCOLATE CAKE 
YOU BET YA IT GETS ME 
HE JUST HAD A VOICE BOX THAT WAS 
HE HAD ONE OF THE MOST LUSHLY ROMANTIC VOICES OF ANY SINGER EVER 
WHEN I FALL IN LOVE 
IT WILL BE FOREVER 
HE WOULD START OFF WITH THE WORD 
IT WOULD GO IN A ROUND SHAPE AND END UP WITH VIBRATO 
HE ELONGATED HIS WORDS 
IN A RESTLESS WORLD LIKE THIS IS 
I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST WENT TO SEE HIM ON STAGE 
HE WOULD WRAP HIS INSTRUMENT AROUND EACH WORD 
AND HE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL 
SEXY AND ER AND GRACEFUL 
COOL IN THE WARMTH OF THE SUN 
TO BE A BLACK MALE SINGER 
SINGING ROMANTIC LOVE SONGS 
OSTENSIBLY TO A LARGELY WHITE FAN BASE MEANING WHITE WOMEN 
WAS A MAJOR EVENT 
IF YOU EVER PLAN TO MOTOR WEST 
TRAVEL MY WAY TAKE THE HIGHWAY THAT'S THE BEST 
NAT WAS MAKING IT BUT TO ENSURE LASTING SUCCESS 
HE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SOME MAJOR CONCESSIONS 
AT A TIME WHEN AMERICA WAS RACIALLY SEGREGATED 
HE WAS VERY DARK SKINNED HE HAD A FLAT NOSE HE LOOKED NEGROID 
IN HIS EARLY DAYS ON NATIONAL T. V. 
THEY PUT MAKE UP ON HIM TO LIGHTEN HIM UP 
I GO THROUGH SAINT LOUIS 
THERE WAS ONE SEQUENCE WE FILMED 
WHERE THEY MADE HIM LOOK ALMOST WHITE 
I'M SORRY THEY DID THAT BECAUSE IT LOOKED VERY BAD 
THERE WAS A BOY 
A VERY STRANGE ENCHANTED BOY 
THEY SAY HE WONDERED VERY FAR VERY FAR 
OVER LAND 
AND SEA 
A SONG CAME IN CALLED NATURE BOY 
THAT WAS HIS FIRST MAJOR HIT 
AND SAD OF EYE IT WENT INTO THE MILLIONS 
IT WAS A VERY BIG HIT FOR NAT 
WISE WAS HE 
AND THEN ONE DAY 
NATURE BOY'S A CRUCIAL RECORD 
BECAUSE OF THE NON ROMANTIC AND NON RACIAL NATURE OF IT 
WE SPOKE OF MANY THINGS 
NAT APPEARED TO HAVE MADE IT HE BOUGHT A MANSION 
IN A DESIRABLE L. A. NEIGHBOURHOOD HANCOCK PARK 
BUT HIS WAS THE ONLY BLACK FAMILY IN THIS PART OF TOWN 
THE NEIGHBOURS WERE OUTRAGED BY IT 
THEY'D NEVER HAD A BLACK PERSON LIVE THERE 
THEY HAD A MEETING ONE NIGHT 
THEY SAID IT ISN'T THAT WE DON'T LIKE YOU 
WE DON'T ANY WANT ANY UNDESIRABLES HERE 
NAT SAID I DON'T WANT ANY UNDESIRABLES HERE EITHER 
BUT THERE WAS WORSE TO COME IN RETURN 
THEY POISONED HIS DOG 
AND THAT REALLY UPSET THE FAMILY THEY ALSO BURNT THE WORD 
CAN I SAY NIGGER YEAH THEY BURNT THE WORD NIGGER INTO HIS LAWN 
UNFORGETTABLE 
HE BUMPED UP AGAINST CUSTOM AND RACISM 
IN A VERY PROFOUND WAY THAT I THINK SCARRED HIM 
THOUGH NEAR OR FAR 
IN THE FACE OF HURT AND PROVOCATION 
NAT REFUSED TO TURN THE PERSONAL INTO THE POLITICAL 
HE SUED HIS ATTACKERS PRIVATELY 
RATHER THAN LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN IN THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT 
HE KEPT HIS DIGNITY 
HE KEPT HIS COOL 
HE WASN'T ON THE MARCHES HE DID IT HIS WAY WINNING PEOPLE OVER 
WITH HIS VOICE THEY LOVED HIM REALISED HE WAS BLACK 
THAT WAS HIS CONTRIBUTION 
UNFORGETTABLE 
TOO 
NAT FOUGHT HIS WAY INTO THE ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENT 
FOR ANDY WILLIAMS IT WAS HIS BIRTHRIGHT 
BOYS WATCH THE GIRLS 
WHILE THE GIRLS WATCH THE BOYS WHO WATCH THE GIRLS GO BY 
ANDY FOUND SUCCESS BY TAKING THE PLAYFULNESS OF COOL AND BLENDING IT 
WITH NINETEEN SIXTIES KOOKINESS 
HE WAS AN AMERICAN STAPLE A REAL AMERICAN GUY 
GOOD VOICE KNEW HOW TO DELIVER A SONG GOOD LOOKING 
THAT'S A PRETTY STRONG COMBINATION GUYS TALK 
GIRL TALK IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE 
IN THE SIXTIES ANDY WILLIAMS PICKED UP THE TORCH 
AND CARRIED ON THE IDEA OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES CROONER 
IT WAS VERY MUCH ONE SPECIFIC ANGLE 
THAT ANGLE WAS SWINGING FOR A FAMILY AUDIENCE 
SUBURBAN TYPES NEWLY HIP TO THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION 
BUT NOT PART OF IT WANTED A SOUNDTRACK TO MATCH 
THEIR GROOVY ASPIRATIONS 
ANDY GAVE IT TO THEM GOOD HE WAS COOL HE WAS HIP 
BUT HE WAS ALSO A FAMILY MAN 
JUST LIKE MOST OF HIS T. V. AUDIENCE 
HOW ARE YOU WANT TO GIVE POP A KISS WOOOOURGH 
ANDY'S SOLO CAREER STARTED IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX 
A FEW YEARS BEFORE HE FOUND HIS OWN STYLE 
YOU TELL ME YOU LOVE ME 
IN THE MEANTIME HE JUST BORROWED FROM ELVIS 
WHEN I MADE BUTTERFLY IT WAS THE FIRST BIG RECORD I HAD 
THEY SAID I COULD HAVE A HIT WITH IT I SAID THAT'S NOT MY STYLE 
I LISTENED TO AN ELVIS RECORD 
I DID IT HOW ELVIS MIGHT HAVE DONE 
TELL ME YOU LOVE ME SAY YOU'LL BE TRUE 
THAT WASN'T WHAT I FELT I COULD DO BUT IT WAS A BIG HIT 
MOON RIVER 
WIDER THAN A MILE 
BUT HE FINALLY FOUND HIS PLACE 
AND A SERIES OF BIG HITS 
WITH A LUSH ROMANTIC CROONING STYLE ALL HIS OWN 
DREAM MAKER 
BASICALLY A BALLAD SINGER CROONER I GUESS WELL THE VOICE 
IT WAS JUST FORTUNATE I DIDN'T SOUND LIKE SINATRA OR NAT KING COLE 
OR BING OR ANY OF THE OTHER SINGERS 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT DISTINCTIVE SOUND TO BECOME A BIG STAR 
I LOVE YOU BABY 
ANDY WAS AN ALL AMERICAN GUY CONFIDENT STYLISH AND IN CHARGE 
AS WITH BING AND FRANK BEFORE HIM HE PUT CROONING CENTRE STAGE 
HE WAS THE MOST EASY APPROACHABLE NON THREATENING GUY 
HE TURNED FROM COPYING ELVIS INTO A KIND OF FACSIMILE OF BING CROSBY 
HE HAD HIS OWN HIT T. V. SHOW THAT RAN FOR NINE YEARS 
IT WAS TRIUMPHAL 
AND ANDY KEPT HIS EYE ON EVERY DETAIL 
HE WOULD GET INVOLVED IN EVERY ASPECT 
ANDY HAD GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WOULD WORK AND WHAT WOULDN'T WORK 
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD COMBINATION 
WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK THE WHOLE DAY THROUGH 
HIS GUESTS WERE PRESSED FROM THE SAME EASY LISTENING MOULD 
I ENJOYED WHAT THEY DID THEY BROUGHT IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC 
WHY DON'T YOU PRACTICE YOUR SINGING 
IT WAS SO COSY EVEN HIS MUM MADE AN APPEARANCE 
MOM I BET PAT BOONE'S MOTHER DOESN'T TALK TO HIM LIKE THAT 
ANDY WILLIAMS'S T. V. SHOW WAS HUGE 
OFTEN ANDY WILLIAMS IS MAN IN CARDIGAN SAT ON STOOL 
YOU PROBABLY FORGET WHAT HE CONTRIBUTED TO MUSIC 
HE WAS VERY CAREFUL ABOUT HIS IMAGE ESPECIALLY HIS HEIGHT 
ANDY HAD ONE STOOL HIGHER THAN THE OTHER 
OH MY GOD I WENT TO THE STAGE MAN WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU TELL ME 
DE DI DE DAY WE'RE GOING TO SING 
ANDY DIDN'T WANT IT KNOWN 
HE WAS STANDING THERE SO THE STUDIO AUDIENCE 
SHOULDN'T SEE ONE STOOL HIGHER THAN ANOTHER 
AMERICA IN THE SIXTIES WAS NO LONGER THE PLAYTHING OF ALL AMERICAN BOYS 
THE NEW SEX DRUGS AND ROCK'N'ROLL 
LEFT ANDY LOOKING RATHER 
SQUARE 
I KNOW YOUR HOME TOWN HAVE YOU BEEN TO LIVERPOOL 
OH YES I'VE BEEN TO LIVERPOOL I'M PRACTICALLY A SCOU ZER 
ANDY'S CAREER DRIFTED INTO A KIND OF CHEESY T. V. NEVERLAND 
I MET A GIRL WITH A BROKEN LEG OH ER WHICH ONE HER BOYFRIEND'S 
ANDY OPENED UP CROONING TO EVERYONE 
HE WAS THE CROONER NEXT DOOR 
CAN'T GET USED TO LOSING YOU 
HE REMOVED THE DISTANCE 
SINATRA'S GLAMOUR AND NAT'S TALENT HAD GIVEN IT 
LOVING YOU 
HE MADE IT ACCESSIBLE 
BUT ORDINARY 
IT WOULD TAKE AN OLD PRO TO EVENTUALLY REVIVE IT 
HI 
THANKS FOR LOOKING IN ON US 
HIS MUSIC WAS VERY STRIPPED DOWN JUST PIANO BASS DRUMS AND HIM 
HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST CROONERS 
STEPPIN' OUT WITH MY BABY 
CAN'T GO WRONG COS I'M IN RIGHT 
ASK ME WHEN WILL THAT DAY BE 
THEY'RE ALL SONGS THAT YOU PLAY WITH YOUR WOMAN 
YOU WOULDN'T GO WITH SIX BEERS 
AND TWO CLOSE BOY FRIENDS TO GO AND SEE TONY BENNETT 
YOU TAKE YOUR WIFE 
I KNOW I'D GO FROM RAGS 
TONY BENNETT IS THE GREAT SURVIVOR 
FOR FIFTY YEARS HE'S BEEN SUAVE SOPHISTICATED AND A SNAPPY DRESSER 
TONY MY FRIEND FROM NEW YORK PLEASURE TONY 
BORN IN NEW YORK IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX AT THE HEIGHT OF THE DEPRESSION 
TONY LEARNT TO SING IN HIS CHURCH CHOIR 
MORE WORLDLY SONGS FOLLOWED WHEN HE PROVIDED FOR THE FAMILY WITH HIS JOB AS A SINGING WAITER 
TONY'S CHANCE TO JOIN THE BIG TIME CAME WHEN BOB HOPE DROPPED BY 
I HAD AN ENGAGEMENT IN GREENWICH VILLAGE 
I WAS SINGING JAZZ BOB CAME DOWN 
HE WAS AT THE PARAMOUNT WITH JANE RUSSELL AND LES BROWN'S BAND 
HE GOT A KICK OUT OF ME 
HE SAID WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
I SAID ANTHONY DOMINICK BENEDETTO 
HE SAID IT'S TOO LONG LET'S AMERICANISE YOU TONY BENNETT 
ALTHOUGH A LOVER OF JAZZ 
IT'S WITH CROONING THAT TONY FOUND GREAT COMMERCIAL SUCCESS 
HE HAD THE NOUS OF THE NEW YORKER AND THE STYLE OF THE ITALIAN 
WRAPPED UP IN THE CONFIDENCE OF A SELF MADE MAN 
HE HAS THAT SPARKLE IN HIS EYE 
THAT COMES FROM THE INNATE PASSION AND THE LOVE OF WHAT ONE IS DOING 
YOU CAN'T FAKE THAT 
THAT'S WHEN I'LL DISCOVER THAT REVENGE IS SWEET 
IT COMES OUT OF HIS PORES AND HIS EYES AND HE SPARKLES 
FROM A FRONT ROW SEAT 
IT'S BETTER TO GIVE THAN TO GET 
FROM WHERE I CAME FROM IN VERY HUMBLE BEGINNINGS COMPLETE POVERTY 
AND THEN TO HAVE WORLD RECOGNITION I'LL NEVER GET OVER THAT AS LONG AS I LIVE 
TONY LOOKED TO BE A CONTENDER FOR SINATRA'S CROWN 
A GREAT PLACE TO BE BUT ALSO DANGEROUS WHAT WOULD FRANK SAY 
GAINING THAT KIND OF RESPECT WASN'T PREMEDITATED HE JUST LOVED MUSIC 
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER TONY WAS TEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN SINATRA 
HE WAS A HUGE FAN OF THE KID 
FOR YEARS I GOT THIS THING YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE LIKE SINATRA 
YOU HAVE A HIT RECORD BUT I WAS CONSIDERED A FLY BY NIGHT 
THEN SOMEONE CALLED AND SAID WAIT TILL YOU HEAR WHAT SINATRA SAID ABOUT YOU IN LIFE MAGAZINE 
HE MENTIONS DIFFERENT SINGERS THE WEAKNESSES AND STRENGTHS OF EACH 
HE SAID FOR MY MONEY TONY BENNETT'S THE BEST SINGER IN THE BUSINESS IT CHANGED MY CAREER 
NOW IN THE BROTHERHOOD OF CROONERS HIT FOLLOWED HIT 
BUT ONE SONG IN PARTICULAR BECAME HIS CALLING CARD 
I LEFT MY HEART 
IN SAN FRANCISCO 
WE WERE REHEARSING AND RALPH SHARON SAID HE'D FOUND THIS SONG 
WE WERE GOING TO SAN FRANCISCO HE SAID LET'S REHEARSE IT 
IT'S A SONG FOR THAT CITY IT'S I LEFT MY HEART IN SAN FRANCISCO 
WHEN I COME HOME TO YOU 
SAN FRANCISCO 
THE MINUTE THEY HEARD IT THEY SAID YOU'VE GOT TO RECORD THIS 
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD JUST BE A LOCAL HIT BUT IT HAS BECOME MY SIGNATURE SONG THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 
YOUR GOLDEN SUN 
WILL SHINE 
FOR ME 
BY THE EIGHTIES THE HITS HAD DRIED UP 
AND THE PUBLIC SEEMED TO HAVE LOST THEIR TASTE FOR TONY'S CLEAN CUT CROONING 
TONY'S CAREER AND HIS PERSONAL LIFE WERE ON THE SKIDS 
I WAS DEFINITELY MIXED UP 
A COUPLE OF INSULTS PEOPLE GAVE ME WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING WITH YOURSELF 
THAT KIND OF THING FROM GOOD FRIENDS THAT WERE HONEST WITH ME 
IT MADE ME REALISE I'M NOT DOING THIS RIGHT 
SALVATION CAME FROM A SURPRISING PLACE 
LIKE ALL GOOD ITALIAN AMERICANS TONY KEPT IT IN THE FAMILY 
APPOINTING SON DANNY AS MANAGER 
WHEN I GOT INVOLVED WITH HIM HE WAS VERY FRUSTRATED 
SEEING THAT FRUSTRATION AND OPENING UP THAT GATE FOR HIM 
I'D SAID LET ME HELP IT WAS AS SIMPLE AS THAT 
I'D CALL HER FIREFLY FIREFLY 
COS OH MY SHE RADIATES MOON GLOW 
DANNY GAVE TONY THE ONE THING HE WAS LACKING 
STARTS TO GLITTER WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN 
A SENSE OF HUMOUR CROONING FOUND A NEW AND SURPRISINGLY YOUNG AUDIENCE 
THE ENTERTAINMENT WORLD IS ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT PERCEPTION AND TWENTY PER CENT REALITY 
SO MAKING PERCEPTION GREATER THAN REALITY IS MY JOB 
STEPPIN' OUT WITH MY BABY 
CAN'T BE WRONG COS I'M IN RIGHT 
WE HAD TONY DO A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WENT TO THE AUDIENCE 
FOR FIVE YEARS WE WORKED AT DEVELOPING THIS ALTERNATIVE FANBASE 
THAT LED US TO A RECORD DEAL IN EIGHTY FIVE BACK AT COLUMBIA 
THIS IS THE PINNACLE EVENT OF THE DECADE MR. BENNETT 
AND YOU HAVE SHOWED DISRESPECT FOR YOUR ATTIRE WHERE'S YOUR TUX 
IT WASN'T ALWAYS COOL BUT IT DID PUT HIM ON THE MAP 
GOING UP TO THE M. T. V. AWARDS I HAD PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE GOING 
DON'T DO THIS YOU'LL DESTROY HIS CAREER 
I SAID LET'S WAIT AND SEE IT DID WELL AND IT GOT US ON THE RADAR 
FLY ME TO THE MOON 
AND LET ME PLAY AMONG THE STARS 
TONY MADE CROONING HIP AGAIN 
THE ACID TEST APPEARING AT THE MUDDIEST GLASTONBURY EVER 
IN FRONT OF SEVENTY THOUSAND FANS 
MOST OF WHOSE PARENTS WEREN'T EVEN BORN WHEN HE WAS AT THE TOP 
WE FELT PRIVILEGED WE WERE ASKED TO DO GLASTONBURY 
NOTHING GREATER THAN TO SEE SOMEBODY IN THEIR SEVENTIES ON THE STAGE 
GETTING ENERGY FROM A YOUNGER AUDIENCE IT'S CONTAGIOUS BOTH WAYS 
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT GLASTONBURY 
BUT HE WAS AS EVER SUITED AND BOOTED 
A CROONER TO THE LAST 
I THINK I LOOK GOOD TODAY THESE ARE NICE CLOTHES 
ALL THE ROCK ARTISTS WOULD COME BACK AFTER THE SHOW AND SAY 
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T GET MUD ALL OVER YOU I SAID IT TAKES TIME 
YOU COULD SEE HE HAD JOY DOING WHAT HE WAS DOING ON STAGE 
THERE'S NOTHING NICER THAN WATCHING SOMEONE WHO'S ENJOYING THEMSELVES 
YOU SIT THERE AND ENJOY IT WITH HIM 
HE'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMERS I'VE EVER SEEN 
THAT KIND OF RESURGENCE IS IMPORTANT TO SHOW WHAT SHOWMANSHIP IS 
MAKE IT ONE FOR MY BABY 
AND ONE MORE FOR THE ROAD 
I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THINGS I JUST WON A GRAMMY 
THE TITLE OF THE ALBUM WAS WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD 
SOME CYNIC SAID IT'S A WONDERFUL WORLD 
I SAID THINK OF THE ALTERNATIVE 
D. A. D. A. D. A. DO DAY Y. Y. 
THE SUMMER WIND 
CAME BLOWIN' IN 
FROM ACROSS THE SEA 
IT LINGERED THERE 
TO TOUCH YOUR HAIR 
AND WALK WITH ME 
ALL SUMMER LONG 
WE SANG A SONG 
THEN WE'D STROLL THAT GOLDEN SAND 
TWO SWEETHEARTS 
AND THE SUMMER WIND
