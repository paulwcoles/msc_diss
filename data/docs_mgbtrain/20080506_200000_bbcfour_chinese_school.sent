CHINA A ONE PARTY COMMUNIST STATE UNDERGOING RAPID CHANGE 
HOME TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SCHOOLCHILDREN AND THE SMALL TOWN OF XIUNING 
THIS IS THE STORY OF THREE SCHOOLS HERE IN XIUNING 
AND LIFE OVER THE YEAR OF THE GOLDEN PIG 
CHINA TODAY IS UNDERGOING A NEW REVOLUTION 
COMMUNISM AND CAPITALISM ARE COLLIDING ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
FROM THE MEGA CITIES TO SMALL TOWNS 
AS MILLIONS MOVE IN A MASS WAVE OF URBANISATION CHASING JOBS AND MONEY 
BUT ONE EVENT HELPS TO HOLD SOCIETY TOGETHER 
CHINESE NEW YEAR 
THE SPRING FESTIVAL 
FOR MANY IT'S THE SYMBOL OF FAMILY ITSELF 
AND THEIR ONLY CHANCE TO RETURN HOME TO THEIR LOVED ONES 
IN ALL OVER TWO BILLION JOURNEYS ARE MADE DURING THE SPRING FESTIVAL 
IN WHAT IS THE BIGGEST MOVEMENT OF HUMANS ON THE PLANET 
FOR TOP STUDENT WU YUFEI IT MEANS A LONG TRIP HOME FROM UNIVERSITY IN BEIJING TO SEE HER FAMILY 
FOR BROADCAST STUDENT ZHA YUJIE IT'S THE ONE TIME IN THE YEAR 
WHEN HER MIGRANT WORKER MOTHER CAN COME HOME TO XIUNING 
AND FOR TEACHERS WU AND YE 
IT'S AN AUSPICIOUS TIME OF YEAR TO GET MARRIED 
IT'S THE END OF DECEMBER 
ZHA YUJIE AND NING SHEJIAN ARE GIVING ONE OF THEIR REGULAR LUNCHTIME BROADCASTS 
THEY'RE OLD FRIENDS AND HAVE BEEN RUNNING THE SCHOOL RADIO STATION FOR ALMOST A YEAR 
IN ANHUI A MOUNTAINOUS PROVINCE THE TEMPERATURE IS STEADILY DROPPING 
HEATING IN CHINA IS STATE SUPPLIED 
AND CONSIDERED UNNECESSARY IN SOUTHERN AREAS LIKE THIS 
NEVERTHELESS WINTERS IN XIUNING ALTHOUGH SHORT CAN BE SHARP 
SO KEEPING WARM REQUIRES INGENUITY 
A WEEK LATER AND ZHA YUJIE HAS COME SOMEWHERE EVEN COLDER 
SHE HAS TRAVELLED OVER ONE THOUSAND KILOMETRES NORTH TO BEIJING 
WHERE THE AVERAGE WINTER TEMPERATURES ARE WELL BELOW ZERO 
IT IS THE FIRST TRIP TO THE CAPITAL FOR BOTH ZHA YUJIE AND HER FATHER 
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD ZHA YUJIE WANTS TO STUDY BROADCASTING AT UNIVERSITY 
AND ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT SIGNS UP FOR A THREE WEEK PREPARATORY COURSE AT A SPECIALIST CENTRE 
SHE HAS MANAGED TO NEGOTIATE SOME TIME AWAY FROM SCHOOL 
AND PERSUADED HER PARENTS TO PART WITH THE HUGE THREE THOUSAND YUAN FEE 
IT'S ABOUT TWO MONTHS' SALARY FOR THE AVERAGE TEACHER 
THEY CAN ONLY AFFORD IT BECAUSE HER MOTHER EARNS MORE MONEY WORKING AWAY FROM HOME 
THERE'S JUST TIME FOR A BEIJING BREAKFAST BEFORE THE COURSE BEGINS 
THE FOOD IN THE CAPITAL MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTING 
BUT SHE IS DETERMINED TO MAKE A SUCCESS OF HER BROADCASTING TRAINING 
AND GETS STUCK IN WITH SOME VOCAL EXERCISES 
BUT AS ZHA YUJIE HONES HER SKILLS IN BEIJING 
HER FRIENDS AT SCHOOL ARE PUTTING THEIRS ON SHOW 
ALTHOUGH SPRING FESTIVAL IS STILL WEEKS AWAY 
HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL HAS ALREADY STARTED CELEBRATING 
THEY ARE HOLDING THEIR ANNUAL TALENT CONTEST 
IT'S A CHANCE FOR THE BRAVE AND THE BEST TO SHOW OFF THEIR ABILITIES 
AND IMPRESS THE JUDGES 
FIRST PRIZE IN THE CONTEST IS THE HONOUR OF PERFORMING IN FRONT OF TOP PARTY DIGNITARIES 
AT THE UPCOMING 
MR. DI IS HEAD OF CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN THE XIUNING COUNTY GOVERNMENT 
HE HAS COME TO THE SCHOOL TODAY TO SELECT THE BEST AND MOST APPROPRIATE PERFORMANCE 
YEAR TWO CLASS FOUR ARE ABOUT TO PERFORM THEIR CONTRIBUTION 
AN INTERPRETATION OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST CLASSIC THE EAST IS RED 
THEIR LEAD DANCER IS THIRTEEN YEAR OLD XIAN YAQING 
THE EAST IS RED WAS THE DE FACTO ANTHEM OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
DURING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
IT WAS PLAYED IN EVERY TOWN AND SUNG IN EVERY SCHOOL 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY CHINA LAUNCHED ITS FIRST SATELLITE 
WHICH BROADCAST THE EAST IS RED ACROSS THE UNIVERSE 
IT WILL BE A WHILE BEFORE XIAN YAQING DISCOVERS IF HER CLASS HAS WON OR NOT 
FIRST MR. DI MUST REPORT BACK TO THE OTHER PARTY OFFICIALS 
WILL THEY CHOOSE THE BREAK DANCING OR THE COMMUNIST CLASSIC 
OVER AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL THE STUDENTS ARE ALSO CELEBRATING 
BUT FOR A DIFFERENT REASON 
TWO OF THEIR TEACHERS WHO MET AT THE SCHOOL ARE GETTING MARRIED 
IT'S JUST A FEW WEEKS UNTIL SCHOOLS BREAK UP FOR THE SPRING FESTIVAL 
AND PREPARATIONS ARE WELL UNDER WAY 
IT'S SUNDAY MORNING AND SIXTEEN YEAR OLD XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT LIU XIANG 
IS AT HIS GRANNY'S HOUSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
THE FAMILY STILL VALUES RURAL TRADITIONS 
AND TODAY THEY'RE INDULGING IN AN AGE OLD CUSTOM 
THE KILLING OF A FATTENED PIG TO BE EATEN AT SPRING FESTIVAL 
IT'S AN IMPORTANT LOCAL RITUAL 
AND ALL THE FAMILY HAVE COME TO GRANNY'S HOUSE TO TAKE PART 
AT HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL AFTER A LONG WAIT 
THE RESULTS OF THE TALENT CONTEST ARE FINALLY OUT 
PERHAPS UNSURPRISINGLY THE PEOPLE'S CONGRESS HAVE SELECTED THE COMMUNIST CLASSIC THE EAST IS RED 
BACK IN THE CAPITAL ZHA YUJIE HAS COME UP AGAINST SOME UNFORESEEN PROBLEMS IN HER BROADCAST TRAINING 
ALTHOUGH MANDARIN IS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF CHINA 
THE SIZE AND POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY MEAN THAT MOST PEOPLE SPEAK ONE OF HUNDREDS OF LOCAL DIALECTS 
ZHA YUJIE HAS GROWN UP SPEAKING THE LOCAL DIALECT OF XIUNING 
AND HER MANDARIN IS HEAVILY ACCENTED 
UNACCEPTABLE FOR CHINESE TELEVISION 
AS PART OF THE UNIVERSITY'S ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 
ALL WOULD BE BROADCASTING STUDENTS MUST WRITE AND READ A SPEECH INTRODUCING THEMSELVES 
IN PERFECT MANDARIN 
AT HOME IN XIUNING ZHA YUJIE'S FRIEND NING SHEJIAN HAS BEEN WONDERING WHERE SHE HAS GONE 
IT'S THE WEEKEND AND HE HAS DECIDED TO COOK A MEAL FOR SOME OF THE STAFF AND RESIDENTS OF THE WELFARE HOME 
WHERE HE'S LIVED SINCE HE WAS ABANDONED AS A BABY 
DESPITE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHINESE BABIES BEING ABANDONED EVERY YEAR 
THERE ARE ONLY AROUND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY CHILDRENS' HOMES IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY 
MOST BABIES ARE ADOPTED 
BUT SOME LIKE NING SHEJIAN ARE PUT IN ADULT WELFARE HOMES 
AND CARED FOR BY THE STATE 
BUT NING SHEJIAN ALSO GETS HELP FROM ANOTHER SOURCE 
HE RECEIVES OCCASIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM A LOCAL GOOD SAMARITAN MR. BI 
MR. BI IS AN ENTREPRENEUR WHO OWNS A CLOTHING FACTORY IN A NEARBY CITY 
HE HAS MADE IT BIG DESPITE COMING FROM A POOR PEASANT FAMILY HIMSELF 
AND IS KEEN TO HELP OTHERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING 
HE CAME ACROSS NING SHEJIAN OVER TEN YEARS AGO 
WHEN HE WAS BEGGING ON THE STREETS AT THE AGE OF FOUR 
XIAN YAQING LIVES AT HOME A SHORT WALK AWAY FROM HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL 
WHEN NOT REHEARSING THE EAST IS RED FOR THE UPCOMING PERFORMANCE AT THE PEOPLE'S CONGRESS OF XIUNING 
SHE PRACTICES THE GUXHENG A TYPE OF CHINESE HARP 
XIAN YAQING'S MOTHER IS A COMMUNITY WORKER 
PART OF HER JOB IS TO DEAL WITH UNMARRIED MOTHERS 
ACCORDING TO CHINA'S STRICT BIRTH CONTROL REGULATIONS 
WOMEN ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GET MARRIED UNTIL THEY ARE TWENTY 
AND HAVING A BABY BEFORE THIS AGE OR OUTSIDE MARRIAGE 
IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED

STUDYING AT THE SAME SCHOOL WHERE THEY NOW TEACH 
WEDDING MARCH BY MENDELSSOHN 
SCHOOL AUTHORITIES ARE KEEN TO GET YOUNG TEACHERS TOGETHER 
AND PARTY SECRETARY JIN HAS GOT A WELL TESTED MATCHMAKING TECHNIQUE 
SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO EIGHT COUPLES TEACHING AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL HAVE GOT MARRIED 
AT CHINESE WEDDINGS GUESTS OFTEN PLAY TRICKS ON THE COUPLE 
AND MAKE THEM TAKE PART IN SUGGESTIVE GAMES 
PING MIN PRIMARY THREE MILES WEST OF XIUNING 
IS A CHARITY RUN SCHOOL FOR DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN FROM THE SURROUNDING RURAL AREAS 
AS TERM DRAWS TO A CLOSE THE CHILDREN ARE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO PUBLICLY DISCUSS THEMSELVES AND OTHERS 
AND CHOOSE THE BEST PUPILS IN THEIR CLASS 
AFTER A DISCUSSION OF A CANDIDATE'S GOOD AND BAD POINTS 
IT'S TIME TO VOTE ON WHO IS THE BEST OVERALL 
ONE OF THE FRONT RUNNERS IS HONG XIAOJUN 
ZHA YUJIE HAS FINISHED HER BROADCASTING TRAINING IN BEIJING 
AND IS RETURNING TO XIUNING FOR THE COMING SPRING FESTIVAL 
ZHA YUJIE LIVES ALONE WITH HER FATHER 
HER MOTHER IS A MIGRANT WORKER IN A CITY ABOUT FIVE HOUR'S DRIVE AWAY 
WHERE SHE SELLS CLOTHES AND SENDS MONEY BACK TO HER FAMILY 
THE THREE WEEKS THAT SHE SPENT IN THE CAPITAL HAVE BROUGHT HER MANDARIN UP TO BEIJING STANDARDS 
BUT IT'S A WORLD AWAY FROM WHAT HER FRIENDS SPEAK BACK HOME 
BACK AT HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL SHE'S EAGER TO CATCH UP WITH HER OLD FRIEND AND FELLOW BROADCASTER NING SHEJIAN 
IT'S TWO WEEKS SINCE XIUNING SCHOOL TEACHERS WU AND YE GOT MARRIED 
LIFE AT SCHOOL IS RETURNING TO NORMAL 
TEACHER YE IS TAKING A POLITICS CLASS 
A MANDATORY SUBJECT FOR EVERY STUDENT 
CLASSROOM DEBATE IS NOT ENCOURAGED 
TODAY'S SUBJECT IS NATIONAL UNITY 
LATER THAT DAY TEACHER WU MOVES THE LAST OF HER THINGS TO TEACHER YE'S ROOM 
A LARGE PART OF THE MARRIAGE COST GOES TOWARDS A GLOSSY WEDDING ALBUM 
SHOT WEEKS BEFOREHAND IN A PROFESSIONAL STUDIO 
WHERE COUPLES CAN CHOOSE FROM A VARIETY OF COSTUMES AND SETTINGS 
IT'S TWO DAYS TO GO UNTIL XIAN YAQING AND HER CLASSMATES 
PERFORM AT THE PEOPLE'S CONGRESS OF XIUNING 
TODAY THEY ARE PRACTISING ONE LAST TIME 
IN BEIJING TOP STUDENT WU YUFEI HAS COME TO THE END OF HER FIRST TERM 
AT CHINA'S BEST UNIVERSITY 
SHE AND HER FRIEND ARE HEADING BACK TO XIUNING FOR THE SPRING FESTIVAL

IT'S THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY AND ALL THREE SCHOOLS ARE FINALLY BREAKING UP 
AND THE STUDENTS ARE GOING HOME FOR THE MONTH LONG SPRING FESTIVAL HOLIDAY 
THE YEAR OF THE GOLDEN PIG IS SOON TO BECOME THE YEAR OF THE EARTH RAT 
WHILE SOME ARE LEAVING XIUNING AND GOING BACK TO THEIR VILLAGES 
MANY MORE ARE ARRIVING FROM THE CITIES 
THE POPULATION OF THE TOWN SWELLS OVER SPRING FESTIVAL 
AS MIGRANT WORKERS RETURN HOME FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
TO CELEBRATE WITH THEIR FAMILIES 
LIU XIANG'S FIRST HOLIDAY TASK IS BRAVING THE CROWDS 
TO STOCK UP ON FESTIVAL ESSENTIALS WITH HIS PARENTS 
BUT THIS YEAR SPRING FESTIVAL IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT 
AS PEOPLE MAKE THEIR FINAL PREPARATIONS 
NATURE HAS A SURPRISE IN STORE 
IT STARTS TO SNOW 
AND SNOW AND SNOW 
BUT IT'S NOT ALL FUN AND GAMES 
ZHA YUJIE IS EXPECTING HER MOTHER HOME FOR SPRING FESTIVAL 
BUT WITH THIS MUCH SNOW IT'S NOT AT ALL CERTAIN SHE'LL MAKE IT 
THE HEAVY SNOWSTORMS ARE THE WORST CHINA HAS SEEN IN FIFTY YEARS 
SINKING MANY AREAS INTO A DEEP FREEZE 
AFFECTING POWER TO THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE 
AND CAUSING FOOD SHORTAGES AND TRAVEL CHAOS 
WHAT IS MORE THE SNOW HAS COME AT THE WORST TIME 
TRAVEL DURING SPRING FESTIVAL IS NOTORIOUSLY CROWDED 
AS MILLIONS FIGHT FOR PLACES ON BUSES AND TRAINS 
THIS YEAR THE WEATHER HAS MEANT THAT MANY OF THOSE MILLIONS 
ARE LEFT STRANDED AT STATIONS AS ROADS AND RAIL TRACKS THICK WITH ICE 
BECOME IMPASSABLE 
LUCKILY FOR NING SHEJIAN HIS SPRING FESTIVAL JOURNEY 
IS A SHORT ONE 
HE IS ONLY TRAVELLING A FEW KILOMETRES FROM THE WELFARE HOME 
TO A NEARBY CITY WHERE HIS GOOD SAMARITAN MR. BI LIVES WITH HIS FAMILY 
ONE OF THE TRADITIONS OF SPRING FESTIVAL 
IS TO BUY NEW CLOTHES FOR THE NEW YEAR 
TODAY MR. BI'S SON IS TREATING NING SHEJIAN 
TOP STUDENT WU YUFEI IS GOING TO SPEND THE SPRING FESTIVAL 
WITH HER GRANDPARENTS IN A SMALL MOUNTAIN VILLAGE 
ABOUT FORTY FIVE KILOMETRES EAST OF XIUNING 
DURING THE FESTIVAL ON NEW YEAR'S EVE 
EVERY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IS INVOLVED IN 
CERTAIN TRADITIONS OF THIS SPECIAL DAY
