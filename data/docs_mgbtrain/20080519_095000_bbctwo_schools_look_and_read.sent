I'VE MADE IT I'M A SUPERHERO 
I'VE LEARNED LOADS OF STUFF 
ABOUT ME ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE AND ABOUT WORDS 
DID YOU LEARN WHILE I WAS SAVING JOSIE AND PETER FROM VICTOR VIRUS 
MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU DID A BIT OF WORK I CAN'T DO EVERYTHING 
I HAVE A LIST SOMEWHERE AH HERE 
THESE ARE THINGS BERLIE USES WHEN SHE WRITES A STORY 
SHE USED THEM ALL WHEN WRITING MY STORY 
WHAT YOU NEED WHEN WRITING A STORY IS LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORDS 
NOUNS VERBS ADJECTIVES ADVERBS 
BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET THESE TWO MIXED UP 
ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS ARE BOTH DESCRIBING WORDS BUT ARE DIFFERENT 
ADJECTIVES TELL YOU WHAT THINGS ARE LIKE BLUE FAST CLEVER 
REMIND YOU OF ANYONE 
ADVERBS DESCRIBE HOW THINGS ARE DONE QUICKLY CAREFULLY CLUMSILY OH 
ADVERBS ARE EASY TO SPOT BECAUSE MOST END IN LY 
AS LORD HAMISH FOUND OUT WHEN HE TRIED TO FLY OVER THE WATERFALL 
HOW MANY ADVERBS CAN YOU SPOT HERE THERE ARE SEVEN 
MY NAME IS LORD HAMISH WWWOHHH WHAT'S THE MATTER 
I WANT TO FLY OVER THE WATERFALL I USED TO BE ABLE TO 
IF ONLY I COULD REMEMBER THE WORD FOR IT IT'S AN LY WORD 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I KNOW HE WANTS TO PLAY THE ADVERB GAME 
OH YES TRY FLYING HAPPILY OVER THE WATERFALL 
GO ON TRY IT OOH OH 
NOT QUITE RIGHT 
MERRILY TRY SADLY 
FLY BRAVELY OR GRUMPILY SUITS HIM 
SLOWLY HURRIEDLY 
DID YOU SPOT THEM 
REMEMBER THE ADVERB THAT WORKED IT WAS 
EASILY IT WAS ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE ALL THE TIME 
AH THE GREEN GLEN 
YOU GET THROUGH A LOT OF DESCRIBING WORDS WHEN YOU'RE WRITING A STORY 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SCENES ARE SO DIFFERENT I MEAN TAKE THIS PLACE 
THE CASTLE OF GLOOM 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT DON'T SAY GLOOMY 
COME AND HANG FROM THESE SPIKES 
WHAT DID YOU THINK I FOUND GOOD ONES HOW ABOUT 
WHAT ABOUT THIS PLACE CAN YOU FIND WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS 
THIS WAY 
OR THIS AHH ANY IDEAS 
THERE YOU ARE A BIT OF HELP AT LAST 
YOU NEED A BARRELFUL OF ADJECTIVES TO DESCRIBE THOSE 
GOOD JOB I'VE GOT ONE YOU CAN USE IT TO DESCRIBE PEOPLE LIKE SIMON 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HIM 
AND MISS WORDSWORTH 
WHAT DO YOU THINK MY FAVOURITE WORD FOR MISS WORDSWORTH IS KIND 
OR URGGGHHH HIM 
I HAVE LOTS OF ADJECTIVES TO DESCRIBE HIM 
WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST 
NASTY FOR A START THEN EVIL 
WICKED MONSTROUS FIENDISH HATEFUL REPULSIVE 
OH I'M SORRY I GOT CARRIED AWAY 
ALL THESE WORDS MEAN ROUGHLY THE SAME THING 
THAT MEANS WE CAN KEEP THEM IN THE SYNONYM BIN 
SYNONYMS DIFFERENT WORDS THAT MEAN THE SAME 
REMEMBER WHEN I LAY HELPLESS IN PETER'S BAG 
MISS WORDSWORTH AND THE CHILDREN USED SYNONYMS TO HELP ME OUT 
LIST THE SYNONYMS IN THIS SCENE 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THINK OF WORDS THAT WILL MAKE HIM FEEL STRONGER 
LIKE HEALTH MORE WHAT ABOUT STRENGTH 
POWER MIGHT THAT'S IT GREAT WORDS KEEP GOING 
COME ON ENERGY FORCE VIGOUR LOOK AT HIM 
IT'S WORKING YEESSS 
HA HA ZIP ZAP ZEE 
YES COME ON 
YOU DON'T BURY ME 
DID YOU GET THEM ALL 
ANOTHER THING THAT BERLIE USED IN THE STORY 
WAS WORDS THAT RHYME AND WORDS THAT DON'T RHYME 
REMEMBER THE RHYME CHIME CHAMBER 
WHERE ARE WE IT'S LIKE A HALL A PLACE FOR A BALL 
I'VE SEEN THEM DANCE AND ALL LET'S GO 
WE'RE TRAPPED HELP THEY WON'T HEAR US THROUGH THESE STONES WE'LL DIE 
TWO HEAPS OF BONES HEY I TALKED IN RHYME YOU DO IT ALL THE TIME 
SOME PEOPLE THINK MAKING A RHYME IS EASY PEASY 
YOU JUST PUT ANOTHER LETTER AT THE BEGINNING 
TAKE THE WORD HALL CUT THE TOP OFF USE ANOTHER LETTER INSTEAD 
BINGO YOU'VE GOT BALL HALL RHYMES WITH BALL 
THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO MAKE A RHYME 
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK FOR SOME WORDS 
WHAT ABOUT COUGH 
WHEN YOU TAKE THE TOP OFF COUGH AND PUT ANOTHER LETTER ON 
YOU END UP WITH ERM BOUGH 
BUT BOUGH DOESN'T RHYME WITH COUGH 
BOUGH RHYMES WITH COW 
SO TAKE THE LETTER OFF AGAIN 
CHOOSE ANOTHER AND WHAT DO YOU GET 
ROUGH 
IT ALSO DOESN'T RHYME WITH COW BOUGH OR COUGH 
WHEN YOU WANT TO SPOT A RHYME 
LISTEN TO WHAT WORDS SOUND LIKE NOT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE 
FOR A WORD LIKE PETER 
YOU CAN HAVE PETER LITRE 
METRE HEATER 
THEY LOOK DIFFERENT BUT THEY SOUND THE SAME 
HOW MANY RHYMES CAN YOU SPOT HERE 
WE'RE GOING MAD 
IT'S NOT THAT BAD 
HELP I'M ZZAAP WE'RE TRAPPED 
WE KEEP SPEAKING VERSE I KNOW THERE'S NOTHING WORSE 
FIND THE TIME TO END THE RHYME 
IT WON'T TAKE MUCH DETECTION YOU'LL FIND IT IN YOUR REFLECTION 
REFLECTION WHAT CAN YOU SEE PETER 
I'VE GOT IT CAN YOU REMEMBER THE WORD THAT DIDN'T HAVE A RHYME 
A WORD THAT RHYMES WITH MIRROR 
BIRROR HIRROR TIRROR THERE ISN'T ONE 
CAN YOU NAME ANY OTHER WORDS THAT DON'T RHYME WITH ANYTHING 
HERE'S SOMETHING THAT CAN GET YOU OUT OF TROUBLE WHEN YOU'RE WRITING 
COMMAS FULL STOPS APOSTROPHES 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'LL NEED THEM 
NOT A FULL STOP OR COMMA IN SIGHT 
I USUALLY PUT FULL STOPS IN FIRST 
YOU MUST FIND WHERE A SENTENCE ENDS 
TRYING READING IT OUT LOUD 
WHEN SOMETHING MAKES SENSE STOP 
DECIDE WHERE THE FULL STOPS COME 
WHEN THE SENTENCES ARE SPLIT UP 
PUTTING THE FULL STOPS IN IS EASY 
COMMAS TELL YOU WHEN TO LEAVE A PAUSE 
THERE'S ONLY ONE WHERE DOES IT COME 
THERE'S JUST ONE OF THESE LEFT 
APOSTROPHES 
THEY LOOK LIKE COMMAS EXCEPT YOU PUT THEM UP IN THE AIR 
WHERE LETTERS HAVE BEEN MISSED OUT 
YOU SEE 
IT'S SHORT FOR ZZAAP DID NOT 
DO YOU KNOW WHY I DID NOT 
BECAUSE I WAS ABOUT TO FIGHT VICTOR VIRUS 
WORDS AND FULL STOPS ARE IMPORTANT 
BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE IT A GOOD STORY 
CREATE INTERESTING CHARACTERS THEN MAKE THINGS DIFFICULT FOR THEM 
THEY SHOULD LEARN THINGS 
I STARTED ALL RIGHT FLYING IN TO HELP JOSIE AND PETER 
BUT THEN I GOT ZONKED BY THE BADDY 
THEN I GOT ZONKED BY THE GOODIES 
THEY THOUGHT I WAS THE VIRUS 
BUT I LIVED TO FIGHT AGAIN 
ONLY AT THE END OF THE FINAL CHAPTER DID I WIN THE FINAL BATTLE 
I KNOW 
TIME'S UP 
VICTOR VIRUS HAS SCORED NINETEEN 
AND ZZAAP HAS SCORED 
TWENTY 
YOU SEE EVERY STORY IS A JOURNEY SOMETIMES SMOOTH SOMETIMES BUMPY 
THAT'S WHAT MAKES AN ADVENTURE REALLY WORTH READING 
REMEMBER JOSIE AND PETER THEY DIDN'T LIKE EACH OTHER MUCH 
WHY DO I HAVE TO PLAY WITH HER 
BUT BY THE END THEY WERE GETTING ON FAMOUSLY 
SIMON YOUR GAME WAS BRILLIANT 
YOU WERE REALLY GOOD AT IT YOU TOO 
SO HOW DID THAT HAPPEN 
THEY MUST HAVE LEARNT SOMETHING ABOUT EACH OTHER DURING THE STORY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY LEARNT 
IT'S LIKE SIMON AND MISS WORDSWORTH THEY DIDN'T START OFF WELL EITHER 
WHAT'S GOING ON SHALL I TELL MISS WORDSWORTH NO WAIT A BIT 
I'LL HAVE A WORD WITH HER 
ERM MISS WORDSWORTH YES 
DID ANYONE TOUCH THE GAME THIS MORNING NO 
WHY IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH PETER AND JOSIE NO NO PROBLEM 
HANDS UP WHO THINKS SIMON SHOULD HAVE TOLD MISS WORDSWORTH 
WHAT WAS HAPPENING STRAIGHT AWAY ONE TWO THREE 
SHOULD SHE HAVE TOLD SIMON SHE'D MESSED WITH HIS GAME 
SO WHY DIDN'T THEY 
MAYBE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO ADMIT THEY'D MADE A MISTAKE 
OR THOUGHT IT WASN'T THAT IMPORTANT 
IN THE END THEY GOT INTO SUCH A MESS THEY HAD TO TELL THE TRUTH 
MISS WORDSWORTH SIMON 
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU ME TOO YOU FIRST 
LIKE JOSIE AND PETER THEY LEARNT THAT TWO HEADS WERE BETTER THAN ONE 
RIGHT HEADS 
LEFT 
RIGHT 
LEFT 
RIGHT 
WELL MAYBE NOT ALWAYS BUT YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING 
THE CHARACTERS GOT IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS 
AND WHAT THEY DID COULD MAKE IT BETTER OR WORSE 
IN THE END IT WORKED OUT FINE NOT FOR VICTOR BUT FOR ME 
AND JOSIE AND PETER AND MISS WORDSWORTH AND FRANCES AND SIMON 
OF COURSE UH THEY COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT ME 
BUT THEN I WAS THE HERO AND THAT'S WHAT HEROES ARE FOR 
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GOODIES WIN 
AH I'D BETTER GET BACK TO MY CORNER 
I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL YOU ZZAAP I KNOW THAT TONE OF VOICE 
I'VE GOT THIS GREAT IDEA FOR A STORY 
HERE WE GO AGAIN BYE 
MY NAME'S SERENA COWDY AND I WROTE THIS POEM WHEN I WAS ELEVEN 
IT'S CALLED EXCUSES EXCUSES 
I WROTE THIS POEM BECAUSE I'VE HEARD SO MANY DIFFERENT EXCUSES 
FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE I DECIDED TO GET SOME DOWN ON PAPER 
THIS POEM TOOK ME THIRTY FIVE MINUTES TO THINK OF 
AND ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO WRITE DOWN 
IT USUALLY WORKS LIKE THAT 
I USUALLY END UP WRITING IT DOWN VERY QUICKLY 
WELL YOU SEE SIR THE REASON I'M LATE SIR 
IS BECAUSE 
MY MAM FELL DOWN THE STAIRS AND SQUASHED OUR DOG 
GRAN TOOK A FUNNY TURN 
WHEN SHE SAW WHAT MAM DID TO THE CHEESE PLANT WHEN SHE FELL 
SO AN AMBULANCE CAME AND TOOK OUR GRAN AWAY 
AND BY THIS TIME I'D MISSED THE BUS WHAT WITH ALL THE EXCITEMENT 
AND WHEN THE NEXT CAME THERE WAS ONLY ONE PLACE LEFT 
SO I WAS KIND LIKE YOU TELL ME TO BE SIR 
AND LET OLD MRS. BRIGGS ON FIRST 
SO THEN I HAD TO WALK 
WHICH TOOK ABOUT THREE YEARS SIR 
SO YOU SEE SIR 
I DIDN'T GO TO NATALIE WILSON'S VALENTINES PARTY AND THEN OVERSLEEP 
JUST IN CASE YOU THOUGHT I HAD
