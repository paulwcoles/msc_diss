IT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO WOULD YOU 
BELIEVE BUT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN LAST 
WON THE WORLD TITLE TO SOME THE 
FACT THAT THE PLAYER REGARDED AS 
THE GAME'S WORLD ENTERTAINER HAS 
ONLY ONE OF TROPHY TWICE IS A 
SURPRISE HE HAS TO GET PAST MARK 
WILLIAMS ANOTHER TWICE WORLD 
CHAMPION AND A PLAYER NOT TO BE 
UNDERESTIMATED IT WAS YESTERDAY 
EVENING THAT RONNIE AND MARK'S 
SECOND ROUND CLASH BROKE OFF A 
TIGHT OPENING FRAME WHEN RONNIE'S 
WAY ON THE BLACK MARK BOUNCED BACK 
IN THE SECOND FRAME TO LEVEL THE 
SCORES 
A VERY TIGHT THIRD FRAME WAS 
SETTLED WHEN RONNIE ROLLED IN THIS 
LONG DOUBLE ON THE PINK TO SNATCH 
BACK THE ADVANTAGE 
BUT MARK FOUGHT BACK TO LEVEL THE 
MATCH AT TWO TO TWO AT THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL RONNIE WAS SUPERCHARGED 
AFTER THE BREAK HE HIT A ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
CLEARANCE THE HIGHEST BREAK OF THE 
TOURNAMENT SO FAR AND EIGHTY ONE GAVE 
RONNIE THE SIXTH AND AFTER A POOR 
SHOT FROM MARK A FRAME WINNING SIXTY ONE 
GAVE O'SULLIVAN THE SEVENTH FIVE TO TWO DOWN 
MARK NEEDED THE FINAL FRAME OF THE 
SESSION TO STAY IN TOUCH HE HIT A 
SUPERB BREAK OF EIGHTY EIGHT SIGNALLING THE 
END OF AN ABSORBING EVENING OF 
CRUCIBLE SNOOKER 
FIVE TO TWO BECAME FIVE TO FOUR IN FRAME 
IT IS 
MARK AT THE TABLE FOURTEEN POINTS UP 
WITH COMMENTARY BY JOHN VIRGO AND 
CLIVE EVERTON 
IT MUST BE LOVELY FOR WILLIAMS 
AFTER HIS LONG SPELL IN THE 
DOLDRUMS TO BE IN CONTENTION AGAIN 
IN A BIG MATCH HE IS PLAYING IN 
THE GREATEST SNOOKER VENUE IN THE 
WORLD 
YES AND THIS WILL TEST AT WORLD YOUR NERVE HE PLAYED WELL IN THE 
FIRST SESSION AND HE STARTED THIS 
I MEAN O. K. THE FIRST FRAME HE 
NEEDED A COUPLE OF TRIES AT POTTING 
FRAME BALL BUT APART FROM THAT HE 
HAS LOOKED VERY COMPOSED 
WELL I DON'T THINK HE PLAYED TO 
CANNON THE RED L. THINK HE WAS 
GOING TO TRY AND SCREW ROUND THE 
BACK OF IT FORTY FOUR AHEAD L. THINK HE 
JUST WANTED TO MISS THE RED AND 
COME BACK FOR THE RED IN THE SAME 
POCKET AS THE BLACK 
HE IS TAKING IT ON IN IT GOES 
WHERE IS THE CUE BALL GOING WHERE 
IS IT GOING WELL IT DID NOT GO 
IN THE POCKET BUT I CANNOT SEE AN 
EASY POT ON A COLOUR BUT IT WAS A 
VITAL RED HE IS NOW FORTY FIVE POINTS IN 
FRONT STILL A POSSIBLE FIFTY NINE LEFT ON 
THE TABLE 
TIME TO CLOSE IT UP 
MAYBE GREEN UNDER THE SIDE CUSHION 
JUST PASSED THE MIDDLE POCKET 
POSSIBLY 
WELL THAT WAS THE INTENTION BUT 
THE GREEN IS NOT UNDER THE CUSHION 
WELL HE COULD HAVE MADE A BETTER 
JOB OF IT THAN THAT BUT AGAIN HE 
WAS ALSO CONCERN ABOUT LEAVING THIS 
RED THAT IS UP IN THE BAULK END 
RONNIE COULD PLAY GOOD SAFETY HERE HERE'S THE PLAYERS'S VIEW 
A GOOD SHOT IN THE END 
RONNIE HAS 
GOT TO BE LITTLE BIT CAREFUL WHEN 
HE IS PLAYING THIS RED THERE IS 
ALWAYS DANGER HE IS GOING TO 
KNOCK A RED TOWARDS THE RIGHT HAND 
CORNER AND THE BROWN IS NOT COMING 
TO HIS RESCUE THAT IS A MISTAKE RED BLACK WOULD BE SUFFICIENT 
SO HE HAS MISSED FRAME BALL IN THE 
SECOND FRAME OF THE EVENING JUST 
AS HE DID TWICE IN THE FIRST FRAME 
AND IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF ANY 
POSITIONAL HEROICS HE JUST PLAYED 
TO POT THE BLACK 
ABSOLUTELY SO 
THERE IS A LITTLE CHINK IN THE 
ARMOUR THERE 
I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN SEE ENOUGH 
OF THIS RED TO PLAY THE POT STILL 
NOT A BAD SHOT BUT HE HAS NOT 
FOUND THE BAULK CUSHION THAT JUST 
TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE OFF 
THE SHOT FOR MARK BUT HE WILL HAVE 
IT IN HIS MIND THAT HE HAS MISSED 
FRAME BALL AGAIN IT CAN GNAW AWAY 
AT YOUR CONFIDENCE 
HE JUST 
CONCENTRATED ON ROLLING THE BLACK 
INTO THE FIFTY THREE IN FRONT WITH FIFTY ONE ON THE 
TABLE BUT OVER CUT IT 
I THINK HE HAD HALF A MIND THAT 
THAT RED MIGHT GO IN THE POCKET 
BLUE THIS RED IS 
BUT CATCHING THE BLUE THIS RED IS ON 
THAT IS O. K. HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE 
TOO STRAIGHT ON THIS BLACK IF HE 
IS HE WILL HAVE PROBLEM GETTING 
ONTO THE NEXT RED OF COURSE HE IS 
FORTY FIVE POINTS BEHIND HE CANNOT AFFORD 
TO CHANCE PINCHING BIT OF THE 
POCKET ON THE BLACK HE IS PLAYING 
THE BROWN FOR POSITION 
THAT IS A LOVELY SHOT WHAT A THING 
TO HAVE IN YOUR ARMOURY THE FACT 
THAT YOU CAN PLAY WITH EITHER HAND 
WELL MARK WILLIAMS MAY LIVE TO 
REGRET THAT MISSED BLACK THIRTY THREE POINTS 
IN IT 
HE HAS TO GET OFF THIS LAST RED 
NOW THE PROBLEM START PROBLEMS 
I DON'T DEIGN RONNIE WAS INTERESTED 
HE MAY HAVE THOUGHT I WILL BE 
LUCKY JUST CATCH THE GREEN QUARTER 
BALL BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
IS TO GET GOOD ON THE YELLOW THIS 
GREEN IS POTTABLE IF HE PUTS THE 
CUE BALL IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THAN IDEAL 
YES IT IS GOING INTO WHAT WE CALL 
A BLIND POCKET A DELICATE ONE BUT 
THERE AND NOW IT IS ALL ABOUT 
BROWN TO BLUE AND HE LOOKS INCH 
PERFECT TO ME ON THE BROWN 
JUST NEEDED IT TO BOUNCE HE WOULD 
LOVE 
TO HAVE 
BEEN STRAIGHT ON THIS 
BLUE 
HE CUED IT LIKE A DREAM ALL ABOUT 
TIMING 
WHAT A FRAME 
TO PINCH THIS 
WOULD BE 
WILLIAMS MISSED FRAME BALL 
O'SULLIVAN MADE A FINE FORTY EIGHT CLEARANCE 
TO SNATCH THE FRAME ON THE BLACK 
O'SULLIVAN LEADS BY SIX TO FOUR 
QUITE A STEEL THE HIGH 
STANDARD OF PLAY WAS MAINTAINED BUT 
IT WAS RONNIE WHO MAIN EXTENDED 
THAT LEAD 
TO NINE TO SIX 
IS 
THE FINAL 
THAT LEAD TO NINE TO SIX HERE IS THE FINAL FRAME OF THE SECOND SESSION 
HOW ON EARTH DID HE 
DO THAT IT LOOKED THE EASIEST 
THING 
IN THE 
WORLD TO 
JUST ROLL IT 
INTO THE BUNCH ANY THEORIES ABOUT 
THAT JOHN PERHAPS WANTED TO 
THE CUE BALL CLOSE TO THE PINK I I DON'T REALLY KNOW POSSIBLY IT IS 
THE WORST SHOT I HAVE EVER SEEN 
RONNIE 
PLAY IT 
IS SUCH A BIG 
TARGET L. CAN'T BELIEVE THAT NEITHER CAN HE 
WILLIAMS UNABLE TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT 
ADVANTAGE HE IS ANNOYED WITH 
HIMSELF 
USUALLY POTS THOSE BUT THE 
SCOREBOARD PRESSURE AS THE SAYING 
GOES NINE TO SIX DOWN HAD HE BEEN NINE TO SIX UP 
AND FLOWING PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE 
MISSED IT 
HE MAY PLAY THE RED IMMEDIATELY 
ABOVE THE BLACK AND JUST 
A STUN 
THE LITTLE TRIANGLE JUST BELOW THE 
PINK AND CAN STILL PLAY THE BLACK 
INTO THE OPPOSITE CORNER HE IS NOT 
PERFECT ON THIS BLACK HERE 
AND HE HAS OVER CUT IT REPRIEVE 
FOR WILLIAMS THE AWKWARD BRIDGING DID HIM IN THE THERE IS 
ONE LOOSE 
RED HE 
PLAY 
FOR BUT 
I THINK 
IT IS WORTH 
THE RISK 
HERE POT 
THE BLACK 
COME 
OFF THE 
SIDE CUSHION 
INTO THE 
CLUSTER HERE WITH PACE 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNLUCKY IF IT 
HAD DROPPED DON'T BANG AROUND THE 
TABLE MARK 
WELL THIS COULD BE 
THE MOMENT WHICH MAKES THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NINE TO SEVEN AND TEN TO SIX 
HAD THAT RED TRAVELLED ON ANOTHER 
MILLIMETRE O'SULLIVAN WOULD HAVE 
BEEN IN THE POSITION THAT WILLIAMS 
IS IN NOW 
AS A MATTER OF INTEREST 
IF THAT RED DID DROP IN NOW FROM 
WHEN IT WAS BEING 
PUT IT IT 
WOULD BE REPLACED IT WOULDN'T BE A 
FOUL SO TO SPEAK 
IT IS CERTAINLY ON THE BRINK CLIVE 
HE PLAYED A BAD SHOT THERE HE THE 
RED OVER 
THE MIDDLE 
COME TO HIS 
RESCUE I 
FEEL EVEN IF 
HE CAN'T 
GET THROUGH 
IT DIRECT 
CAN KNOCK ONE ON TO IT HE CAN 
KNOCK ONE ON TO IT 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS MY 
IMAGINATION WE HAVE BEEN 
HERE OVER 
A WEEK NOW 
THEY HAVE 
RECOVERED THE 
CLOTHS BUT 
THESE TABLES LOOKED 
BE RUNNING A LITTLE QUICKER TO ME 
I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT JOHN BUT 
EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY WE ARE NOT 
GETTING THE SPRINGY BOUNCES OFF THE 
NEW CLOTH THAT WAS FITTED OVERNIGHT 
THE NEW CLOTH FITTED OF COURSE THE 
CUSHION RAILS 
AS 
WELL AS 
THE BED OF THE TABLE 
NINE TO SEVEN BEHIND AT THE END OF THIS 
SECOND SESSION 
THAT HE WOULD 
HAVE SHARED THE EIGHT 
FRAMES THIS EVENING 
QUITE A FEAT 
CONSIDERING HOW WELL O'SULLIVAN HAS 
PLAYED 
IN ONE OF THE EARLIER FRAMES 
WILLIAMS MADE A SEVENTY SIX AND A VERY 
OPPORTUNITY TO 
GO ON TO MAKE A 
CENTURY BUT 
DIDN'T BOTHER 
JUST 
PLAYED A 
TOKEN SAFETY WANTED 
PLAYED A TOKEN SAFETY WANTED TO GET ON WITH THE NEXT FRAME MARK 
WILLIAMS WAS NINE TO FIVE DOWN HE TOOK THE 
LAST TWO FRAMES AND SO O'SULLIVAN 
LEADS BY NINE SEVEN OVERNIGHT 
FINAL SESSION THIS AFTERNOON LIVE 
HERE ON B. B. C. TWO THE 
STATE OF 
PLAY

FROM ULSTER 
ALTHOUGH 
JOB OF 
SEEING THE 
FUNNY SIDE

HUMOUR WAS 
REWARDED WHEN 
LIANG MISSED 
TO HAND HIM 
THE FRAME THREE TO ONE AT THE 
TO HAND HIM THE FRAME THREE TO ONE AT THE INTERVAL BACK FROM THEIR BREAK AND

FEW MORE THAN 
STUART HE 
EVENTUALLY 
WON IT ON THE PINK FRAME TO SAFELY 
IN 
THE BACK 
PERRY TO 
GO OUT SOME 
OF THE 
STRESS ON THE BLACK BALL 
STUART WAS ADOPTING A MORE SOFTLY 
SOFTLY 
APPROACH WHICH PAID 
SOFTLY APPROACH WHICH PAID DIVIDENDS IN THE 
FORM OF A 
COUPLE 
FORTY BREAKS IN FRAME THREE THE 
POSITIONAL SHOT OF THE

BOYCE TO HAVE 
FOUND A 
FLUENCY

THE RAILS 
DOWN 
ON A BREAK 
OF FIFTY THREE 
TO HAND THE 
DOWN ON A BREAK OF FIFTY THREE TO HAND THE INITIATIVE TO

SECOND SESSION OF THOSE MATCHES 
THIS AFTERNOON FINAL TONIGHT NOW 
THE GREATEST FRAME 
WINNING CELEBRATION 
OF THE 
WINNING CELEBRATION OF THE TOURNAMENT SO FAR 
IT COMES 
AUSTRALIA'S NEIL 
ROBERTSON IN 
MATCH 
WITH STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE THE 
MATCH WITH STEPHEN MAGUIRE THE PROBLEM 
THOUGH IT 
TOOK THE MATCH 
SCORE TO 
NINE TO 
ONE TO 
STEPHEN 
NEIL 
LOST THE FIRST 
SESSION EIGHT TO ZERO 
LOST THE 
FIRST FRAME OF 
THE SECOND 
SESSION BUT 
TO HIS 
GREAT RELIEF 
REVERTED THE 
POTENTIAL OF A 
WHITEWASH BY WINNING FRAME TEN THEN 
WENT IN SEARCH 
OF A MOST 
UNLIKELY 
MIRACLE THE 
UNLIKELY MIRACLE THE SCORE MOVED ON TO 
TEN TO 
TWO 
DO IN 
FRAME 
STEPHEN TO PLAY NO SCORE THE 
COMMENTARY IS BY 
NEAL FOULDS AND 
TERRY GRIFFITHS 
PINK IS AVAILABLE IN THE LEFT 
CORNER SLIGHT ANGLE TO GO UP FOR THE BLUE IT HAS BEEN A REAL 
CONTRAST BETWEEN 
THE FIRST AND SECOND SESSION THIS 
IS THE FIRST BREAK OVER ZERO 
HE HAS 
MADE AND WE 
ARE IN THE FIFTH FRAME 
HE DIDN'T 
REALLY PLAY 
AT ALL 
HE MANAGED 
TO WIN A COUPLE 
BUT IT 
JUST GOES 
DIFFERENCE 
FROM ONE 
DAY TO 
THE NEXT 
AT THIS GAME 
WELL I DID MENTION 
EARLIER 
WHAT CAN 
YOU DO AFTER 
PLAYING 
SO WELL AND 
PLAYING SO WELL AND WINNING THE SESSION EIGHT TO ZERO 
HOW CAN 
YOU 
THAT SOMETIMES 
IT CAN HAVE AN 
THAT SOMETIMES IT CAN HAVE AN EFFECT 
YES WELL NEIL ROBERTSON EFFECT HASN'T PLAYED BRILLIANTLY HE IS 
PLAYING 
TO CUT THIS 
IN 
AND HE HAS 
HIT IT 
SO MUCH 
TOO 
THIN IT 
AN EASY SHOT BUT 
HE NEARLY MISSED 
THE RED ALTOGETHER DIDN'T QUITE GET 
ON THE 
PACK COULD BE ON NOTHING HERE C. V. 
ANGLE 
THE CUE 
BALL COMES 
IN 
TO CATCH 
THE TOP 
REDS ALL THE 
DOWN 
ON THE LEFT HAND 
SIDE AS WE 
DOWN ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AS WE LOOK 
AT IT 
AND HE WOULD 
DEFINITELY 
LOOK AT IT AND HE WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE SPLIT THEM OUT 
JUST A 
HAVE SPLIT THEM OUT JUST A FRACTION BUT IT IS ENOUGH IN THE 
END HE 
JUST GOT 
DOWN AND 
HE HARDLY TOOK ANY TIME ON 
THINK HE IS A BIT ANNOYED ABOUT 
WAY HE 
PLAYED THE PREVIOUS SHOT BUT NOT HAPPY TO SAY THE LEAST 
THIS WAS REQUIRED'S SHOT HE DIDN'T 
EVEN HIT IT MAGUIRE'S IT HAS 
BEEN A 
VERY STRANGE 
MATCH THERE 
HAS NOT 
ONLY BEEN 
SOME GREAT 
HAS NOT ONLY BEEN SOME GREAT SNOOKER BUT SOME 
PRETTY AVERAGE 
STUFF ESPECIALLY 
THIS EVENING 
STUFF ESPECIALLY THIS EVENING FROM BOTH PLAYERS 
HE WANTS TO PLAY THE RED WITH THE 
YELLOW HE LOOKS LIKE THE BEST 
OPTION FOR GOOD SAFETY SHOT IT 
LOOKS LIKE WELL AFTER ALL THAT 
HE HAD A KICK BUT HE HAS COME OUT O. K. HE HAS IT IS WORTH A TRY THIS RED 
HE WILL BE ON PINK OR BLACK A 
GREAT SHOT THIS 
HE NEEDS A KISS ON THE BLACK NOT 
BAD HE CAUGHT IT A LITTLE THINNER 
IF HE HAD COURTED LITTLE 
THINNER IT WOULD HAVE HELPED 
COURT IT 
THAT WAS A THIN CUT SLIGHTLY 
AWKWARD BRIDGING IT COULD NOT HAVE 
WORK DONE BETTER WORKED OUT 
WRONG SIDE OF THE BLUE THE REFEREE 
MICHAELA TABB WAS DOWN LOOKING 
BEND THEN 
THAT WAS THE BEST SHOT HE HAS 
PLAYED FOR A WHILE POSITION AND 
THE AT LEAST 
YES HE MIGHT BE A 
LITTLE HAPPIER THAN HE WAS EARLIER 
IN THE FRAME HE WAS JUST SIMMERING 
AS HE DOES SOMETIMES WHEN HE GETS 
WORKED UP IT IS SOMETIMES WHEN HE 
PLAYS HIS BEST SNOOKER THIS IS 
FRAME BALL HE HAS TAKEN A GLANCE 
AT THE SCORES SO HE WILL BE AWARE 
THAT THIS IS ALL HE NEEDS IT LOOKS 
LIKE HE IS GOING TO EXTEND HIS LEAD 
ONCE AGAIN 
YES THAT IS A FAIR POINT IF 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE GET LITTLE BIT 
TOO FLAT OUT THERE HE LOSES HIS 
INSPIRATION WHEN HE IS OUT THERE 
THERE IS FINE LINE OF COURSE 
BETWEEN BEING OVER THE TOP AND 
UPSET WITH EVERYTHING AND FIGHTING 
THAT AND NOT GETTING UPSET AT 
ANYTHING HE MADE THAT THIRTY ONE BREAK 
QUICKLY ENOUGH 
INDEED IT WAS ON TO FRAME FOURTEEN 
STEPHEN TO PLAY HE IS NINE POINTS 
BEHIND 
HE LOOKS TO HAVE A PERFECT ANGLE ON 
THE BLUE PEN THEN 
THE PINK LOOKS AS IF IT IS ON ITS 
SPOT IT IS CLEAR TO POT AND GET ON 
THE LAST RED SIXTEEN IN FRONT TWENTY TWO WITH 
THE PINK 
WELL IT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT MORE 
COMPLICATED HE HASN'T GOT AN ANGLE 
OBVIOUSLY TO GET BEHIND THE PINK 
HE WILL HAVE TO SCREW BACK HE STILL NEEDS A COLOUR WHICH PROBABLY WILL BE THE BLUE 
SO TWENTY EIGHT THE DIFFERENCE WITH JUST THE 
COLOURS LEFT 
HE HAS A LONG LEAD BUT I THINK HE 
WOULD LIKE TO GET THE MATCH OVER 
TONIGHT IT WOULD GIVE HIM TOMORROW 
OFF BUT IT MAY NOT BE THE CASE NOW WELL THE BLACK GOES IN 
NEAL ROBERTSON HAS WON ANOTHER 
FRAME BUT HE STILL TRAILS 
THAT TAKES US TO FRAME FIFTEEN 
ROBERTSON IS PLAYING HE HAS A LEAD 
OF FIFTY TWO POINTS OF THE TWENTY TWO POINTS 
THIRTY TWO 
IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE TABLES 
TABLE THERE WAS A GAP BETWEEN 
THOSE REDS 
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT HE IS JUST 
STARTING TO PLAY HIS CONCENTRATION 
DID NOT LOOK VERY GOOD IN THE FIRST 
FEW FRAMES BUT HE IS STARTING TO 
WARM TO THE TASK BUT HE IS SUCH A 
LONG WAY BEHIND YOU JUST FEEL HE 
COULD NOT WIN THE GAME FROM HERE 
REALLY 
HE HAS HAD A LOOK AT THE THREE REDS 
CLOSE TOGETHER THE RED ON THE LEFT 
OF THE THREE WILL POT L. THINK WE 
HAD A MARK MATCH LAST YEAR 
SHAUN MURPHY CAME BACK FROM ELEVEN TO FIVE 
ANOTHER STEPHEN MAGUIRE WILL NOT BE 
COUNTING HIS CHICKENS HE SEEMS TO 
HAVE PLAYED A LITTLE BIT FLAT LAST 
NIGHT AFTER YESTERDAY'S TERRIFIC 
SESSION HE LOOKS TO HAVE PULLED 
ANOTHER FRAME BACK IT WAS ELEVEN TO TWO IT 
LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING TO BE ELEVEN TO FOUR 
HE IS CERTAINLY PLAY EVEN BETTER 
PLAYING THE RED PASSES THE BLACK 
HIS CONFIDENCE IS BACK HE PLAYED A 
SCREW BACK AND MOVE THE RED AS WELL 
THIS IS THE BEST WE HAVE SEEN OF 
HIM IN THIS MATCH PLAYING MUCH 
QUICKER HE IS MORE AGGRESSIVE 
PERHAPS A LOT OF SHREWD PUNTERS 
THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A VERY CLOSE 
MATCH 
A NINETY EIGHT BREAK MENTAL STILL A NINETY EIGHT 
BREAK THEN 
NEAL WON THE FINAL FRAME OF THAT 
FINAL SESSION GOING INTO THE FINAL 
SESSION THIS AFTERNOON HE HAS A 
CHANCE JUST STEPHEN IS JUST THE 
FAVOURITE 
TWO CLOSE AFTER WATCHING AN 
AUSTRALIAN WE FEATURE NEW 
ZEALANDER FROM THE CRUCIBLE BYE 
B. YE FOR NOW
