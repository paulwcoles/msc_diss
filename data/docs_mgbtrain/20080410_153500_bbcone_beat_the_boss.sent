AND THE BRIGHT SPARKS WHO HAVE THE CHILDREN'S MARKET COVERED 
THEY'LL BE BATTLING IT OUT FOR VICTORY 
AND THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY 
IT'S TIME TO DELIVER THEIR BRIEF 
I'VE GOT YOUR BRIEF CAN I COME IN YES 
HELLO BIG SHOTS ALL RIGHT MORNING HELLO HOW ARE YOU 
NERVOUS NERVOUS 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE THE BRIEF TO BE 
WE'D LIKE SOMETHING OUTDOORSY SOMETHING QUITE EXCITING 
WHAT WOULD YOUR NIGHTMARE BRIEF BE 
WELL IT'D BE FURNITURE 
ARE YOU READY TO RECEIVE YOUR BRIEF YEAH 
YOUR TEAM HAS TO WAKE UP TO THIS SLEEPY CHALLENGE 
AS YOU'VE GOT TO DREAM UP THE ULTIMATE CHILDREN'S BED 
FOR BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS 
COOL YEAH THAT'S REALLY GOOD 
IT MUST HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO CHILL OUT 
AND IT MUST INCLUDE ONE SPECIAL FEATURE 
YOU'VE JUST HEARD THE BRIEF AND YOU'RE ALL GOB SMACKED AREN'T YOU 
YEAH 
YOU CAN BE REALLY CREATIVE YUP THAT'S WICKED WE'LL WIN 
WHAT ABOUT YOU NAOMI YOU DON'T LIKE FURNITURE 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO 
BUT WE WILL TO BEAT THE BOSSES 
WE'LL BEAT THE KIDS THERE'S NO CHANCE OF THEM WINNING 
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE SOMETHING QUITE AS HARD AS THAT 
BUT I THINK WE CAN DO IT IF WE WORK AS A TEAM 
BEDS ARE BIG BUSINESS 
WE SPEND ON AVERAGE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION ON BEDS EACH YEAR 
SPOTTING A GAP IN THIS COMPETITIVE MARKET COULD BE A NIGHTMARE 
I'VE SENT BOTH TEAMS OFF TO DO THEIR MARKET RESEARCH 
THEY MUST WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM 
IF THEY'RE GOING TO RISE TO THIS CHALLENGE 
SO THEY HEAD OFF TO THE HIGH STREET TO SEE WHAT'S ALREADY IN THE SHOPS 
IF A BED HAD A BLUE TOP BUT THE BOTTOM WAS PINK 
WOULD YOU BUY IT NO 
IF THE GIRLS WANT PINK THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET IT 
THEY WON'T GET VOTES FROM ANY BOYS 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET THEM LIKE HATS WHERE THEY ARE REVERSIBLE 
WHERE YOU CAN FOLD THEM IN AND FOLD THEM OUT 
WE COULD HAVE THAT 
THE INSIDE COULD BE BLUE AND YOU FASTEN IT AND IT'S ALL BLUE 
AND WHEN YOU TURN IT BACK IT'S ALL GREEN YEAH INSIDE OUT COLOURS 
IN A TEAM ME AND NAOMI 
I THINK WE'RE GETTING ALONG MORE THAN WE ARE WITH CHARLES 
BECAUSE HE'S A BOY BUT HE DOESN'T LIKE OUR IDEAS COS WE'RE GIRLS 
WITH THE BRIGHT SPARKS YET TO AGREE ON 
WHAT'S GOING TO WORK FOR BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS 
THE BIG SHOTS ARE TRYING TO GET INTO THE MINDSET OF CHILDREN 
AND THEY'VE GONE TO BED 
IT'S LIKE A DEN ISN'T IT YEP 
YOU CAN SIT IN HERE IT'S REALLY COSY 
I LIKE THE WAY YOU CAN POP THE HEAD IN AND HAVE A CHAT WITH US 
DEFINITELY FEELS VERY COSY 
NEVER MIND KIDS LET'S INVENT AN ADULTS' VERSION OF THIS 
THE BIG SHOTS SEEK OUT THE HELP OF BEN 
A PRODUCT DEVELOPER FOR HABITAT 
IT IS OUR BEST SELLING BED IT'S DOING VERY WELL AND KIDS LOVE IT 
IS IT THE SAILING THING THAT MAKES IT APPEAL TO CHILDREN 
OR DO YOU THINK IT'S THAT IT'S LIKE A ROOM THEIR OWN PRIVATE SPACE 
I WOULD SUGGEST IT'S THEIR OWN PRIVATE SPACE 
IT'S LIKE A DEN IN THERE 
THEY CAN BE IN THERE WITHOUT ANYONE INTERFERING 
I THINK THE TEAM'S WORKING REALLY WELL 
WE ALL HAVE LOADS OF DIFFERENT QUESTIONS 
GOT ANY TIPS FOR US 
START WITH THE FUNCTIONS THAT YOU WANT IT TO HAVE FIRST 
THINK ABOUT THE COLOURS AFTERWARDS 
DON'T GO TOO FANTASTIC WITH THE DESIGN 
BECAUSE IT HAS TO LAST A LONG TIME FOR THE KIDS 
MEANWHILE THE BRIGHT SPARKS HAVE MET UP WITH PAUL STOTT 
AN AWARD WINNING FURNITURE DESIGNER 
FIRST LESSON IN BED MAKING A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP 
THIS IS ONE OF THE NEWER THINGS IN MATTRESSES AT THE MOMENT 
AND THEY'RE VERY COMFORTABLE FOR SOME PEOPLE 
AND FOR CHILDREN IT MIGHT BE A GREAT THING 
COS IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY GET UP THAT CAN GO BACK TO SHAPE 
YEAH THEN IT'S READY FOR THE NEXT NIGHT 
HALFWAY THROUGH THEIR MARKET RESEARCH 
AND BOTH TEAMS ARE FULL OF IDEAS 
THE NEXT STEP FOR THE BIG SHOTS IS TO MEET THEIR TARGET MARKET 
WE HOPE THAT THIS PART OF THE MARKET RESEARCH 
WILL HELP TO GET US INSIGHT INTO WHAT KIDS ACTUALLY WANT 
IF YOU COULD HAVE ANY BED AND ANYTHING ON IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ANY IDEAS WHAT 
A BED LIKE THIS YEAH BUT HAVE DIAGONAL STAIRS 
COS THOSE STAIRS ARE HARD TO CLIMB UP AND YOU CAN'T GO DOWN 
I THINK IT'S GOOD WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S AROUND YOU 
LIKE ERM FOUR POSTER OR SOMETHING YEAH 
SO IT WOULDN'T BE NECESSARILY YOU'D CLIMB UP TO IT 
BUT IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE A FOUR POSTER 
SOMETHING SURROUNDING YOU 
WHAT ABOUT COLOURS ANY PARTICULAR COLOURS YOU GO FOR 
MOOD COLOURS LIKE DARK BLUE OR DARK PURPLE 
I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL HAVE AN IDEA TO BEAT THE BRIGHT SPARKS 
NOW WE'VE SPOKEN TO PEOPLE OF THEIR AGE 
WE'VE GOT MORE INSIDE THEIR MINDS 
AND WE CAN START TO THINK LIKE THEY DO WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO BEAT THEM 
WHILE THE BIG SHOTS THINK THEY'VE CUT THE CHILDREN'S MARKET 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS HAVE 
MET UP WITH SLEEP COACH TO THE STARS NICK LITTLEHALES 
HE'S HELPED THE LIKES OF ENGLAND'S FOOTBALL TEAM 
GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP 
RIGHT GUYS HERE WE ARE IN THIS FANTASTIC SENSORY ROOM 
DESIGNED TO EXPLORE ALL THE MOODS COLOURS AND SUCH LIKE 
THINGS THAT COULD BE REALLY FANTASTIC IN AND AROUND YOUR BED 
CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL YEAH 
I LIKE THESE STRINGY LIGHTS COS YOU COULD TAKE ONE 
AND ATTACH IT ROUND THE SIDE OF YOUR BED 
AND THESE THINGS WOULD BE GREAT TO ADD SOME ATMOSPHERE AROUND YOUR BED 
IS THERE ANY PIECE OF ADVICE YOU COULD GIVE TO HELP US CREATE OUR BED 
ALL THE NORMAL THINGS THAT YOU GUYS LIKE IN YOUR BEDROOMS 
MAKE SURE THAT INSIDE THAT BED 
YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF PLACES TO GET RID OF THEM 
SO THEY'RE NOT DISTRACTING WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GO TO SLEEP 
AND BE VERY CONSCIOUS WHEN YOU'RE USING COLOURS AND TOUCH 
MAKE SURE IT'S ALWAYS SOFT 
COMFORTING AND NOTHING THAT'S TOO STIMULATING 
YEP COS THAT'LL STOP YOU SLEEPING 
NOW WE'VE HAD THE TALK WITH PAUL AND NICK 
IT'S MADE ME MUCH MORE CONFIDENT 
BOTH TEAMS HAVE COMPLETED THEIR MARKET RESEARCH 
BUT HAVE THEY DONE ENOUGH TO COME UP WITH THE ULTIMATE CHILDREN'S BED 
IT'S TIME FOR THE BRAINSTORM 
YOU'VE GOT TO DREAM UP THE ULTIMATE CHILDREN'S BED 
FOR BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS 
RIGHT LET'S GET TO WORK 
THE TOP END OF THE BED IS GOING TO BE A TABLE THAT CAN BE PULLED OUT 
WITH A FITTED ALARM CLOCK ON IT 
PULL OUT TABLE YOU CAN'T DO A PULL OUT TABLE 
THE GIRLS' IDEAS ARE A BIT NAFF AND I THINK 
I'M GONNA HAVE TO HELP TRY AND GET THEM TO CHANGE THEIR IDEAS 
LIKE THE IDEA THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A DEN AS WELL 
SOMEWHERE THAT THEY COULD KINDA 
PULL THE COVERS OVER AND HAVE THEIR OWN PLACE UM 
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT ALMOST EVERYONE SAID 
SO I THINK THE DEN IS HUGELY IMPORTANT 
I THINK WE WORKED AS A TEAM TODAY VERY WELL 
I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE'VE GOT A GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING 
THE BIG SHOTS ARE FULL OF IDEAS 
WHILE THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE DISCUSSING WHAT MATERIALS TO USE 
BEFORE DECIDING WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IS IT SILVER OR SILVER ACRYLIC 
IT'S METAL WE NEED TO DECIDE WHICH SILVER WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WELL HE SAID IT'D BE EASIER TO DO THE SILVER ACRYLIC ACRYLIC 
CHARLES I THINK HE HAS LOTS OF GOOD IDEAS 
BUT HE CAN'T GET A WORD IN EDGEWAYS FOR CHARLOTTE JUST BUBBLING 
WELL LOOKS LIKE YOU MADE A START 
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR SPECIAL FEATURE 
WE'RE HAVING A FITTED ALARM CLOCK OOH 
AN ALARM CLOCK WOW WEE 
DOESN'T EXCITE ME 
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHAT IS YOUR DREAM BED 
BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
YOU'VE GOT Z. POD YOU'RE WRITING A STORY AND YOU'VE JUST WRITTEN Z.'S 
IT'S NOT A GOOD START 
GET YOUR HEADS TOGETHER GET YOUR IDEAS DOWN ON PAPER 
WHAT'S OUR SPECIAL FEATURE WE'VE GOTTA TO CHANGE IT 
WE NEED TO CHANGE A LOT OF THINGS 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE NOT WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM 
THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THEIR MARKET RESEARCH 
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE IN TROUBLE 
BIG SHOTS I CAN SEE YOU'VE DRAWN A LIST UP 
WE'VE GOT THIS LIST WE'VE COME TO A CONCLUSION 
FOR SOME EXTRAS BUT THE SHAPE OF THE BED WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING WITH 
I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
BECAUSE IF I LOOK AT YOUR LIST 
YOU'VE GOT THINGS LIKE DEN LIGHTING SIZE 
YOU'RE NOT REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE BED 
YOU'RE THINKING A LOT ABOUT ACCESSORIES 
AND CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT BUT IF I TAKE YOU BACK TO YOUR BRIEF 
YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH A BED AND ONE SPECIAL FEATURE O. K. 
I'LL BE BACK TO SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING O. K. 
SO WHILE THE BIG SHOTS GO BACK TO THE BRIEF 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN MY HARSH WORDS ONBOARD 
AND ARE NOW WORKING AS A TEAM 
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE RECTANGULAR 
NO COS IT'S BORING IT'S EVERYDAY COMMON INNIT 
YEAH BUT IF YOU MAKE IT LOOK 
HOW ABOUT A FOOTBALL SHAPE A FOOTBALL PLAYER 
YEAH BUT NO IT'S ROUND 
YOU KNOW WHEN A FOOTBALL'S GOT HEXAGONAL SIGNS BLACK AND WHITE 
THAT COULD BE THE BASE A FOOTBALL 
THEM THINGS WE SAW AT THE SENSE CENTRE 
THEM WIRES WE COULD HAVE THEM AS THE NETS 
WE COULD HAVE THAT AS NETTING SO IT LIGHTS UP 
WE COULD GET THOSE WIRES FLASHING BLUE GREEN AND RED 
AND THOSE FLASHING PINK AND PURPLE FOR GIRLS YEAH 
IT'S NOT JUST THE BRIGHT SPARKS WHO THINK THEY'RE ONTO A WINNER 
THE BIG SHOTS ARE USING THEIR MARKET RESEARCH TO THE FULL 
AND HAVE DREAMT UP THEIR BED'S SPECIAL FEATURE 
SO MAYBE WE COULD GO FOR SOME NICE TOTALLY CLEAR ACRYLIC POLES 
THAT FORM THE BASIS OF THE BED 
COULD YOU HAVE LIGHTING GOING THROUGH THE BED ABSOLUTELY YEAH POLES 
WE COULD PUT THE LIGHT COMING UP FROM UNDERNEATH 
WE NEED SOME TECHNOLOGY 
A LOT OF THEM SAID THAT THEY HAD M. P. THREE PLAYERS OR THEY HAD A TELEPHONE 
THAT THEY WANTED TO USE AND SPEAKERS IN THE BED CAME UP OFTEN 
O. K. BRIGHT SPARKS YOUR TIME IS UP 
WHAT IS YOUR BED CALLED 
SOCCER SLEEPERS 
SOCCER SLIPPERS SLEEPERS ALL RIGHT O. K. 
WHAT WE'VE DONE WE'VE GOT GREEN AND BLUE WHICH ARE BOY COLOURS 
AND WE'VE DONE THAT AS A NET AND PINK AND PURPLE FOR A GIRL'S NET 
GOOD IDEA WE'VE DONE YELLOW AND RED AS POCKETS 
O. K. GOOD EXCELLENT 
WHAT SHAPE IS THE BED 
CIRCLE FOOTBALL 
AND THE STRINGS FROM THE FOOTBALL NET THEY'RE THE LIGHTS 
THE COLOURED LIGHTS 
ANOTHER FEATURE IS THAT WE'VE GOT SPEAKERS AND A STEREO 
BUILT INTO THE GOALPOSTS ON BOTH SIDES 
IT TOOK YOU A LONG TIME AND I WAS GETTING A BIT WORRIED AT THE START 
BUT YOU'VE PULLED IT TOGETHER WELL DONE 
I'M GLAD CHARLES WAS IN OUR TEAM COS OTHERWISE 
IT'D HAVE ALL BEEN GIRLY STUFF AND NOT FOR BOYS 
LIZ CAN YOU PLEASE PITCH ME YOUR IDEA 
O. K. THIS IS OUR I. SLEEP 
THE MAIN IDEA OF THE BED IS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN GO TO 
AND IT'S YOUR OWN PERSONAL SPACE 
IT CAN BE A DEN OR A PLACE THAT YOU GO WHAT'S YOUR SPECIAL FEATURE 
IT HAS TO BE THE LIGHT SYSTEM 
IT INTEGRATES WITH YOUR MUSIC SYSTEM 
SO WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A SLEEPOVER 
YOUR LIGHTS CHANGE IN RHYTHM TO THE MUSIC 
IT'S GONNA BE MORE OF A THEME PARK EXPERIENCE THAN BEING IN A BED 
YOU REALLY HAVE LET YOUR CREATIVE JUICES FLOW SO WELL DONE THANKS 
YOU HAVE TO PITCH YOUR IDEA TO THE U. K.'S LEADING BED MANUFACTURER 
THEY'LL MAKE IT FOR YOU 
MY ADVICE IS WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM 
THINK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THIS PRESENTATION EXCITING 
WELL DONE IT WAS A HARD CHALLENGE BUT YOU PULLED IT TOGETHER 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS GOT THERE IN THE END 
THEIR IDEA CERTAINLY MEETS THE BRIEF 
BUT HAVE THEY DONE ENOUGH TO MAKE THEIR DREAMS COME TRUE 
OR WILL THE BIG SHOTS' IDEA LIGHT UP ON THE DAY 
FOR THE PITCHES THE BRIGHT SPARKS HAVE WORKED UP 
THEIR SOCCER SLEEPER BED INTO A LAPTOP PRESENTATION 
THE BIG SHOTS HAVE RENAMED THEIR INTERACTIVE FOUR POSTER 
TO THE Z. BED 
BUT ONLY ONE TEAM CAN WIN THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY 
THE PRESSURE'S ON AS THEY MEET FOR THE FIRST TIME 
AT SILENT NIGHT THE U. K.'S BIGGEST BED MANUFACTURER 
THEY'LL PRESENT THEIR IDEAS TO MANAGING DIRECTOR NEAL MERNOCK 
AND HIS TEAM OF EXPERTS 
THE BIG SHOTS ARE GOING TO BE REALLY COMPETITIVE BUT WE KNOW WE'LL WIN 
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT COMPETITION WE'LL BLOW THEM OUT THE WATER 
OH 
IT'S SO BABYISH 
I FEEL MORE CONFIDENT AFTER MEETING THE BIG SHOTS 
THEY JUST ACTED LIKE KIDS 
HELLO GOOD MORNING 
TO DECIDE WHO PITCHES FIRST NEAL TOSSES A COIN 
OH IT'S HEADS YES 
WE SHOULD LET THEM GO FIRST SEE YOU LATER LITTLE UNS 
WE'RE MAKING A BED AND IT'S CALLED SOCCER SLEEPERS OH H. O. K. 
I WAS A BIT NERVOUS 
WHEN WE MET THE PEOPLE I CALMED DOWN IT WAS BETTER 
THE THEME IS FOOTBALL YOU'RE ALL FOOTBALL FANS ARE YOU 
YEAH YEAH WE ALL LIKE FOOTBALL 
THE MATTRESS IS MEMORY FOAM BECAUSE WE TESTED IT AND IT WAS COMFORTABLE 
WE'D LIKE IT TO BE CIRCULAR IN THE SHAPE OF A FOOTBALL 
WITH THE FOOTBALL PATTERN ON IT 
THE GOALPOSTS ACT AS A FOUR POSTERED BED 
THERE'S A BUILT IN STEREO 
THE NETS ARE GOING TO BE STRING LIGHTS 
ONE WILL BE PINK AND PURPLE FOR GIRLS 
AND ONE IS GREEN AND BLUE FOR BOYS 
I LIKE THE MEMORY FOAM IT MOULDS ROUND AND IT'S COMFORTABLE YEAH 
IT'S NICE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE SLEEP YOU'LL GET WHAT ABOUT SIZE 
THE TALLEST PERSON IS NAOMI IF SHE LIES DOWN 
WE COULD MAKE IT ABOUT TWELVE INCHES BIGGER THAN NAOMI 
THINK ABOUT THAT WE'VE BEEN IMPRESSED BY YOUR PRESENTATION 
LISTEN TO WHAT WE SAY 
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A PRODUCT THAT PEOPLE WILL PAY FOR 
AND THEY WILL BE HAPPY WITH 
OUR PITCH WENT VERY WELL BECAUSE THEY LIKED OUR MAIN IDEA 
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN OUR AGE 
NEXT UP THE BIG SHOTS WITH THE Z. BED 
Z. IS THE FOUR POSTER REINVENTED FOR THE M. P. THREE GENERATION 
KIDS WON'T WANT TO GET OUT OF THE Z. BED 
WE'VE PUT SPEAKERS INTO THE BED 
THERE'S A POCKET AS WELL 
SO THEY COULD HAVE A GAMES CONSOLE ON THERE A D. V. D. PLAYER 
WITH THE LIGHTS OFF MATT EXPLAINS THEIR LIGHTING FEATURES 
WE CAN CREATE A NEUTRAL LIGHT WHICH IS VERY PLAIN 
ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE COLOUR SPECTRUM TO WHATEVER PEOPLE WANT 
I LOVE THE LIGHTING CREATING THE MOOD IS REALLY FANTASTIC 
THE CHILDREN WILL SWITCH ON TO THAT 
ONE THING YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT IS THE SLEEP THE COMFORT OF THE BED 
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US HERE 
IT'S JUST A BIT TOO OLD FOR AN EIGHT TO TWELVE YEAR OLD MARKET 
I CAN SEE A TWENTY YEAR OLD ABSOLUTELY 
THIS IS A STRONG IDEA BUT IS IT AN EIGHT TO TWELVE YEAR OLD'S PRODUCT 
I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE BRIGHT SPARKS THEY WERE VERY CREATIVE 
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THE SAME ABOUT THE BIG SHOTS 
I WOULD SAY THEY WERE VERY STRONG POSITIVE PRESENTATIONS 
WITH THE PITCHES PUT TO BED BOTH TEAMS WORK ON THEIR FINAL DESIGNS 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE WORKING WITH SUE ON THE FABRICS 
AND THE BIG SHOTS ARE WITH ANDREW 
GETTING ADVICE ON THE LOOK OF THEIR BED 
SO YOU COULD HAVE MAYBE A RED POCKET AND A YELLOW POCKET YEAH 
I THINK THE MATERIAL WOULD BE NICE IF IT WAS SOFT 
WE THOUGHT A MESH DESIGN COULD BE QUITE NICE I LIKE THAT 
COS YOU'LL FEEL THE MEMORY FOAM THROUGH THE MATERIAL 
AND WE COULD MAKE A QUILT 
TO EMULATE A FOOTBALL 
I LIKE THE MESH I LIKE THE MESH 
YOU GET THAT IN A TUBE FORM O. K. 
SO THAT COULD SIT INSIDE THE TUBE AND SHINE UP YEAH O. K. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OUR HEADBOARD 
THE ONLY THING I WOULD PERHAPS SAY IS THAT IT'S A BIT HARD 
YOU NEED TO INTRODUCE A SOFT ELEMENT 
AS BOTH BEDS BEGIN TO TAKE SHAPE 
IT'S TIME FOR THE TEAMS TO SWAP EXPERTS 
THE BIG SHOTS PICK FABRICS TO CUSTOMISE THEIR BED 
ONE OF THESE FABRICS COULD BE EXCITING 
IT REFLECTS THE LIGHT AND IT LOOKS ALMOST METALLIC 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA AND IT WOULD SOFTEN THE BED UP 
YOU COULD MAYBE DO A COUPLE OF CUSHIONS OR THREE CUSHIONS 
TWO IN ONE FABRIC TO HIGHLIGHT THE WHOLE THING HAVE A LIGHTER FABRIC 
THE WINNING FEATURE OF OUR DESIGN REMAINS THE LIGHTING AND POLES 
IF WE GET THE FABRICS RIGHT AND WE GET GOOD REFLECTIVE FABRICS 
AND THE LIGHTING TAKES OVER THE WHOLE BED 
I THINK THAT'S OUR WINNING FEATURE 
THESE ARE THE LIGHTS WE WERE THINKING OF YOU CAN FEEL HOW SOFT THEY ARE 
IT'LL GIVE YOU A GOOD SURFACE TO REST AGAINST 
WHILST GIVING LOTS OF DRAMA IN THE LIGHTS 
YOU CAN GET THESE IN DIFFERENT COLOURS 
YOU CAN SEE THERE THE SLIDE OUT TABLE 
THAT'LL TUCK IN THERE 
AND ON THE GOALPOST IS THAT THE SPEAKERS 
YEAH THAT'S THE SPEAKERS WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THAT'S WICKED 
THAT'S AMAZING 
WE'VE SEEN THE FINAL DESIGN AND IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD 
IT'S PROPER BRILLIANT IT'S GOT EVERYTHING WE WANTED 
IN MY OPINION BRIGHT SPARKS BETTER WIN 
BECAUSE IT'S A BED DESIGNED BY KIDS FOR KIDS 
BIG SHOTS' DESIGN IS A NICE DESIGN AND MAYBE I WOULD CHOOSE THAT 
BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S A CHILDREN'S BED 
BUT IT'S NOT DOWN TO SUE AND ANDREW TO DECIDE 
THAT'S THE JOB OF OUR TWENTY FIVE EXPERT JUDGES 
BOTH BEDS HAVE NOW BEEN MADE SO IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT 
WHO'S GOING TO BE WALKING AWAY WITH THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY 
IT'S DECISION DAY 
BOTH OUR TEAMS ARE AT THE BEAT THE BOSS H. Q. TO FIND OUT THE RESULT 
I THINK WE'LL WIN WE'VE GOT THE BEST DESIGN THE BEST TEAM 
SO I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT 
I'M REALLY EXCITED I COULDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT 
I'M REALLY COMPETITIVE AND I KNOW I'D BE ABSOLUTELY GUTTED IF WE LOST 
I THINK WE'RE A BIT WISER BECAUSE IT'S A FOOTBALL BED 
AND WE LIKE FOOTBALL SO I THINK WE'LL WIN 
YOU'VE TALKED THE TALK NOW CAN YOU WALK THE WALK 
MY FINAL MESSAGE TO THE BIG SHOTS IS 
LOOK AT THE LIMO BUT DON'T TOUCH IT'S OURS 
IT'S NOT OVER NOT OVER NOT OVER NOT OVER YET 
WHAT'S THAT FUNNY RED THING OVER THERE LOOKS LIKE SANTA'S SLEIGH 
WHERE ARE YOUR SUITS DID THE HIRE RUN OUT ON 'EM 
SETTLE DOWN TEAMS

WELCOME TO THE BEAT THE BOSS BOARDROOM

CAN YOU WALK THIS WAY 
LIZ HOW DO YOU FEEL SLIGHTLY NERVOUS 
FINGERS CROSSED IT'LL BE HOW WE WANTED IT TO BE 
ARE YOU FEELING CONFIDENT I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT A BIG SUCCESS 
RATHER THAN A SMALL FAILURE 
WELL IT'S CERTAINLY A VERY BIG BED 
SO WHEN I SAY GO PLEASE HELP ME TO REVEAL GO 
THERE YOU GO 
IT'S AMAZING THIS IS THE Z. BED 
LIZ YOU'RE SEEING YOUR BED FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I THINK IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
THE PERSPEX BACKBOARD AND THE SPEAKERS 
THE DIFFERENT COLOURS I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH IT 
ROBIN I THINK IT'S GREAT 
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE DESIGN THE POLES LOOK GREAT WITH THE LIGHT IN 
PART OF THE BRIEF WAS TO MAKE IT A PARTY BED 
WHERE PEOPLE COULD CHILL OUT AND HAVE FUN 
AND I THINK YOU DEFINITELY WANNA DO THAT 
AS WELL AS THE LIGHTS AND THE SPEAKERS WE'VE GOT A CONTROL CENTRE 
WHERE PEOPLE CAN PLUG THEIR M. P. THREE PLAYER IN 
WHICH PRODUCES THE SOUND FOR THE SPEAKERS 
AND THEY CAN CONTROL THE BED THROUGH TWO BUTTONS CUT THE LIGHTS 
OR TURN JUST THE POLES ON OR THE SPEAKERS 
HAPPY DEFINITELY 
WELL YOU OBVIOUSLY REALLY LIKE THE Z. BED 
BUT WHAT DOES YOUR COMPETITION HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT 
BRIGHT SPARKS WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE Z. BED 
I LIKE THE SPEAKERS 
BUT THE COLOUR IS A BIT BORING 
I DON'T THINK BOYS'D BE THAT KEEN ON THAT COLOUR 
IT'S A BIT GIRLISH AND MORE GROWN UP INSTEAD OF FOR CHILDREN 
MIXED REVIEWS TOO GIRLIE TOO ADULT 
THEY'RE BOUND TO SAY THAT LET'S SEE WHAT THEY'VE GOT 
EXACTLY BRIGHT SPARKS HOW ARE YOU FEELING 
EVEN MORE CONFIDENT LOOKING AT WHAT THEY'VE PRODUCED 
LET'S REVEAL SOCCER SLEEPERS 
WHOA THE LIGHTS ARE FABULOUS 
CHARLES OPEN THE COMPARTMENT AND YOU CAN WORK THE LIGHTS 
THEY'RE AMAZING ESPECIALLY THE FLASHING ONES 
CHARLES TALK TO ME ABOUT THE THEME OF YOUR BED 
IT'S A BED OF TWO HALVES A GIRL'S AND A BOY'S SIDE 
IT HAS SPEAKERS SO YOU CAN PLUG YOUR M. P. THREE IN AND LISTEN TO MUSIC 
AS WELL AS A BED IT'S A STORAGE PLACE 
ON THAT SIDE THERE ARE RED AND YELLOW POCKETS IF YOU OPEN THEM 
YOU CAN PUT YOUR JEWELLERY OR MONEY IN THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT 
GOOD IDEA THIS IS A MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS IT'S REALLY COMFORTABLE 
YOU LIKE YOUR BED LET'S SEE WHAT THE BIG SHOTS HAVE TO SAY 
BIG SHOTS WHAT DO YOU THINK 
BIG SHOTS THREE BRIGHT SPARKS NIL 
I CAN UNDERSTAND BOYS WOULD LIKE IT DON'T LIKE THE LIGHTS NOT A BIG FAN 
THEY CALLED OUR BED GIRLIE THEIRS IS MORE INTERESTING TO BOYS 
IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THAT WORKS OUT THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT 
THE DESIGN BRIEF SAYS YOU'VE GOT TO CATER FOR BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS 
OUR BED DOES THEIRS DOESN'T 
WE'VE HEARD WHAT BOTH TEAMS THINK OF THEIR PRODUCTS 
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS WHAT YOUR TARGET MARKET THINKS TAKE A SEAT 
WE'LL FIND OUT 
TO MAKE IT FAIR OUR EXPERT JUDGES DON'T KNOW WHO'S MADE WHICH BED 
FIRST THE BIG SHOTS' Z. BED 
THE PIPE LIGHTS ARE A GOOD FEATURE THEY'RE SOOTHING AND RELAXING 
THAT'S COOL 
IF YOU ROLL AROUND AND HIT THE M. P. THREE BUTTON THE SPEAKERS WILL BLAST OUT 
WHAT 
THEY'RE COOL COS THE LIGHTS FLASH IT'S GOOD IF YOU HAVE A SLEEPOVER 
YOU CAN DANCE 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A BOY'S BED 
MY FAVOURITE THING IS THE LIGHTS 
I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S SOFT I ALSO LIKE THE CANOPY 
WHEN YOU JUMP YOU MIGHT BANG YOUR HEAD 
I ALWAYS JUMP ON MY BED DON'T JUMP TOO HIGH 
NEXT IT'S THE BRIGHT SPARKS' SOCCER SLEEPERS 
WOW THAT'S AMAZING 
THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE FOR BOOKS C. D.'S AND D. V. D. S. AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
THEY SHOULDN'T BE FLASHING YOU CAN'T GET TO SLEEP IF THEY WERE LIKE THAT 
THAT'D BE O. K. COS YOU COULD GET TO SLEEP 
THIS IS A BED YOU COULD CHILL OUT ON BECAUSE OF THE LIGHTS 
THEY'RE SOOTHING AND THE BED'S REALLY COMFY 
THE BED'S NOT BIG ENOUGH IF IT WERE BIGGER I'D LIKE IT 
THEY'VE DESIGNED IT LIKE A FOOTBALL NET IT'S COOL IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
BRIGHT SPARKS OUR JUDGES THOUGHT YOUR STORAGE WAS A GREAT IDEA 
BUT FELT IT COULD BE TOO SMALL BIG SHOTS THEY LIKED THE LIGHT TUBES 
BUT THOUGHT IT COULD BE TOO GIRLIE 
BUT WHO DID THEY VOTE AS THE OVERALL WINNER OF THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY 
I HAVE THE RESULT RIGHT HERE

CHEERS 
CONGRATULATIONS BOSSES HOW ARE YOU FEELING

I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT CLINCH IT AT THE LAST MINUTE SO I'M REALLY CHUFFED 
I'M SURPRISED I THOUGHT THE BED WAS TOO ADULT BUT I WAS WRONG 
WE LISTENED TO THE MARKET RESEARCH 
OUR BED WASN'T TOO CHILDISH 
TO BE BEATEN ISN'T VERY NICE I THOUGHT IT EARNED CLOSER THAN THAT 
WHOO SWEET DREAMS
