HI YOU ARE WITH NEWSROUND COMING 
UP WAY YOU COULD GET A SAY ON 
HOW YOUR LOCAL PLAYGROUND GETS A 
MAKEOVER MAKEOVER AND SAVING THE SEAS NEW PLANS LOOK 
AFTER THE WATERS AROUND THE U. K. 
FIRST DO YOU HAVE SOMEWHERE COOL 
TO PLAY OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT IS 
WORRIED NOT ENOUGH KIDS DO SO 
THEY'VE SET ASIDE LOADS OF MONEY 
FOR PLAY AREAS THEY WANT YOU TO 
HELP DECIDE HOW TO SPLASH THE CASH 
SONALI HAS BEEN FINDING OUT MORE 
L'M SURE MOST OF YOU RECKON YOU 
COULD DO WITH A BETTER PLAY AREA 
NEAR YOUR HOME THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
GOT A POT OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION THEY WANT 
TO SPEND ON PLAYGROUNDS IN ENGLAND 
BUT WHAT IS THE BEST WAY OF 
SPENDING THAT CASH THE GOVERNMENT 
SAYS IT IS GOING TO ASK WHAT YOU 
WANT THESE KIDS DESIGNED THEIR 
SCHOOL PLAYGROUND IN BRISTOL I I WOULD LIKE A TREE WITH A TREE HOUSE 
IN IT SO WE COULD GO UP AND PLAY IN 
THE TREE HOUSE 
A BIG SWIMMING POOL 
WITH A ZOO 
A SLIDE WITH A SWIMMING 
POOL AND I WOULD HAVE A TRAMPOLINE 
WITH A SAFETY NET 
A DEATH SLIDE 
WHICH GOES DOWN TO A BALL PIT SO 
NOBODY WOULD GET HURT 
I DON'T 
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET ZOOS AND 
SWIMMING POOLS BUT NO HARM AIMING 
HIGH THE PERSON IN GOVERNMENT IN 
CHARGE OF STUFF TO DO WITH CHILDREN 
IS ED BALLS HE'S BEEN HANGING OUT 
WITH KIDS TO GET THEIR IDEAS BUT 
I'M NOT SURE SWINGING AROUND IS THE 
BEST WAY TO GET KIDS TO PLAY 
OUTSIDE MORE THIS SCHEME ONLY 
COVERS ENGLAND BUT THERE ARE OTHER 
SCHEMES IN PLACE IN WALES SCOTLAND 
AND NORTHERN IRELAND POLITICIANS 
HOPE THAT BY SPENDING MONEY TO 
MAKE PLAYGROUNDS BETTER AND SAFER 
YOU WILL GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY WITH 
YOUR MATES MORE 
IT'S CLEAN UP TIME ACROSS PARTS OF 
AUSTRALIA THOUGH YOU'D NEED MORE 
THAN A BRUSH AND DUSTPAN TO GET RID 
OF THE MESS CAUSED BY THESE 
HURRICANE WINDS THE AREA OF HOBART 
IN TASMANIA HAS BEEN BATTERED BY 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILE AN HOUR WINDS FORTY THOUSAND 
HOMES ARE WITHOUT POWER 
THIS IS A COMPUTER GENERATED IMAGE 
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN SPACE TODAY 
WHAT'S BEEN NICKNAMED EUROPE'S 
SPACE TRUCK DELIVERED FIVE TONNES 
OF FOOD WATER AIR AND FUEL TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION 
WEIGHING TWENTY TONNES AND COSTING 
ABOUT ONE BILLION THERE WILL BE 
FOUR MORE DELIVERIES TO ASTRONAUTS 
OVER THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS 
AND WHY DID BOB THE TURTLE SWAP A 
WARM QUIET MUSEUM FOR THIS 
BUILDING SITE THE TWO FOOT LONG 
SNAPPING TURTLE WAS LOST FOR TWO 
MONTHS HE TURNED UP LOOKING A 
LITTLE THE WORSE FOR WEAR AND A LOT 
MUDDIER THAN BEFORE ALTHOUGH A 
LITTLE ON THE SKINNY SIDE BOB IS 
NOW BACK HOME AND RECOVERING WELL 
WE ALL KNOW THAT OVER FISHING AND 
POLLUTION ARE AFFECTING THE SEAS 
SURROUNDING THE U. K. TODAY THE 
GOVERNMENT RELEASED DETAILS OF WHAT 
IT'S DOING TO LOOK AFTER OUR COAST 
BUT PEOPLE WHO CARE FOR THE 
ENVIRONMENT STILL THINK WE'RE NOT 
DOING ENOUGH HELEN HAS THE STORY 
THE COASTLINE OF THE U. K. IS A LOT 
LONGER THAN PEOPLE THINK WE HAVE 
ELEVEN THOUSAND MILES OF IT IT IS LONGER 
THAN FRANCE'S SPAIN'S ITALY'S AND 
IT IS HOME TO A LOT OF EXCITING 
MARINE LIFE AT THE MOMENT ONLY A 
TINY AREA OF THE SEA IS PROTECTED 
BUT CONSERVATIONISTS THINK MORE OF 
IT SHOULD BE SPECIALLY LOOKED AFTER 
SO NOBODY CAN HARM THE CREATURES 
WHO LIVE THERE THIS PART OF 
CORNWALL IN SOUTH WEST ENGLAND 
COULD QUALIFY AS A MARINE PROTECTED 
AREA IT IS FULL OF CRABS CORAL 
EXOTIC FISH SEALS AND BASKING 
SHARKS AT THE MOMENT THE LAW ONLY 
PROTECTS SOME ANIMALS NOT THE SEA 
I THINK MARINE PARKS WOULD BE A 
REALLY GOOD IDEA IT WILL SHELTER 
THE ANIMALS' HOMES 
WE SHOULD 
PROTECT THEM AS MUCH AS WE CAN BY 
JUST FISHING WHAT WE NEED 
IF I WAS 
IN CHARGE I WOULD LOOK AFTER THE 
SEA AND BAN PEOPLE THROWING RUBBISH 
INTO IT AND PROTECT IT MORE AND 
GIVE IT RESPECT 
THESE PICTURES 
FROM THE MARINE CONSERVATION 
SOCIETY SHOW HOW FISHING NETS CAN 
DISRUPT LIFE ON THE SEABED THIS IS 
NOT THE ONLY THREAT TO SEA 
CREATURES 
THE PRESSURE ON THE SEA CREATURES IS GROWING ALL THE TIME FROM OVER 
FISHING POLLUTION AND NOW CLIMATE 
CHANGE THE IMPACTS OF WHICH WE ARE 
STILL TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH AND 
UNDERSTAND 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT UNDERSTAND WILL DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT MARINE 
LIFE BUT THEY HAVE NOT SAID WHAT 
OR WHEN THEY'LL DO IT 
YESTERDAY WE TOLD YOU ABOUT A 
SURVEY THAT SAID LOTS OF YOU USE 
SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES LIKE BEBO 
AND FACEBOOK THOUGH YOU MIGHT BE 
TOO YOUNG TO SIGN UP AND DOING IT 
COULD PUT YOU IN DANGER LOADS OF 
YOU HAVE EMAILED US AND LIZO HAS 
BEEN TAKING A LOOK 
JESSICA IN NEWCASTLE HAS PROFILES 
ON BEBO FACEBOOK AND MYSPACE BUT 
PROTECTS HERSELF BY NOT GIVING TOO 
MUCH INFORMATION 
JOHN IN LONDON SAYS HE NORMALLY 
GOES ON BEBO HE KNOWS HE'S NOT OLD 
ENOUGH BUT ALL HIS FRIENDS DO AND 
HE NEVER TALKS TO ANYONE HE DOESN'T 
KNOW KNOW SAEMA FROM LEICESTER THINKS IT'S O. K. 
TO GO ON M. S. N. AS LONG AS YOU DON'T 
ADD PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW OR ENTER 
ANY CHATROOMS 
SOPHIE FROM IPSWICH KNOWS LOTS OF 
PEOPLE WHO PUT PERSONAL DETAILS ON 
THEIR PAGES SHE'S SEEN LOTS OF 
PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER AGE ONLINE AND 
THINKS MORE SHOULD BE DONE TO 
PROTECT YOUNGER CHILDREN ON THE 
SITES SITES GEMMA IN NUNEATON SAYS SHE GOES ON 
THE INTERNET EVERY DAY BUT HER 
PARENTS MONITOR EVERYTHING SHE DOES 
SHE SAYS THE ONLY CHAT THING I'M 
ALLOWED TO GO ON IS M. S. N. THANKS 
FOR SHARING WHAT YOU THINK KEEP 
YOUR COMMENTS COMING IN TO THE 
WEBSITE WEBSITE IMAGINE THE SCENE YOU'RE IN 
AUSTRALIA IT'S BOILING HOT YOU 
FANCY COOLING DOWN SO YOU HEAD TO 
THE RIVER THE NEXT MINUTE YOU'RE 
BEING DRAGGED INTO THE WATER BY A 
MASSIVE CROCODILE WELL IT'S 
ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ONE WOMAN 
LUCKILY HER HUSBAND WAS ON HAND TO 
SPRING TO THE RESCUE YOU'LL NEVER 
GUESS HOW HE DID IT 
NO ONE WANTS TO COME FACE TO FACE 
WITH ONE OF THESE BUT IN THE 
REMOTE AREA OF AUSTRALIA THEY ARE 
NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DODGE 
I JUST 
WANTED TO GET SOME WATER ON MY FACE 
AND MY HEAD THE NEXT MINUTE A 
CROC JUST GRABBED ME BY THE LEG IT 
PULLED ME IN L. GRABBED HIM BY THE 
JAW ON TOP AND MY FINGER JUST 
GRIPPED ON THE TOP OF HIS JAW AND 
MY OTHER FINGER GRABBED ON THE 
BOTTOM OF THE JAW AND PUSHED HIM 
TRYING TO OPEN HIS MOUTH 
AS THE 
CROC GRABBED WENDY'S LEG HER 
HUSBAND JUMPED ON ITS HEAD AND 
TRIED OUT A MOVE THAT WOULD MAKE 
ANY CROC'S EYES WATERED 
I ACTED 
QUICK AND JUMPED ON TOP OF IT L. 
POKED ITS EYES 
SHE IS EXTREMELY 
LUCKY WITHOUT HER HUSBAND BEING 
THERE AND DOING WHAT HE DID I 
THINK THE CROC WOULD HAVE HAD THE 
CHANCE OF GETTING HER INTO THE 
WATER 
RANGERS HAVE LAID TRAPS TO WATER TRACK AND CATCH THE CROC WITH A 
SORE EYES LET'S HOPE IT WON'T GO 
AROUND ATTACKING ANYONE ELSE 
WHAT A BRAVE BLOKE THAT IS IT
