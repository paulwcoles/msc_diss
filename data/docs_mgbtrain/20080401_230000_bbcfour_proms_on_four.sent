HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
FOR A PROGRAMME OF BRAHMS ELGAR AND STRAUSS 
THE FIRST HALF OF TONIGHT'S PROM FEATURES TWO SETS OF VARIATIONS 
BRAHMS' VARIATIONS ON THE SAINT ANTHONY CHORALE 
AND TO CELEBRATE THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH 
ELGAR'S EVER POPULAR ENIGMA VARIATIONS 
THAT'S FOLLOWED IN THE SECOND HALF BY TWO PIECES BY RICHARD STRAUSS 
HIS VIRTUOSIC OBOE CONCERTO 
AND THE SUITE FROM HIS OPERA DER ROSENKAVALIER 
ON STAGE NOW ARE THE ROYAL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA 
UNFORTUNATELY DANIELE GATTI THE ADVERTISED CONDUCTOR FOR THIS EVENING'S PERFORMANCE IS UNWELL 
AND THE B. B. C. IS VERY GRATEFUL TO GUENNADI ROJDESTVENSKI 
FOR APPEARING TONIGHT AT VERY SHORT NOTICE 
WELL FIRST TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR 
BRAHMS' VARIATIONS ON THE SAINT ANTHONY CHORALE 
BRAHMS HIMSELF CALLED IT VARIATIONS ON A THEME BY HAYDN 
WHEN IN FACT MORE RECENT SCHOLARS 
HAVE SUGGESTED THE ORIGINAL THEME WASN'T BY HAYDN 
BUT WAS WRITTEN BY ONE OF HIS PUPILS IGNAZ PLEYEL 
SO WE NOW KNOW THE PIECE AS 
VARIATIONS ON THE SAINT ANTHONY CHORALE 
THE OPENING OF THE PIECE 
INTRODUCES THE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISABLE SAINT ANTHONY THEME 
BRAHMS' ORCHESTRATION EVOLVES 
TO INCLUDE EVER MORE OF THE ORCHESTRA 
BUT NOT IN A WAY THAT EVER OVERLOADS THAT THEME 
IT'S ALWAYS CLEARLY RECOGNISABLE 
SO IN TOTAL THERE ARE EIGHT VARIATIONS PLUS THE ROUSING FINALE 
A RESTATEMENT OF THAT ORIGINAL THEME AND A SET OF MINIATURE VARIATIONS 
SHOWING OFF THE VAST RANGE OF BRAHMS' COMPOSITIONAL TOOLS 
SO HERE COMES GUENNADI ROJDESTVENSKI 
TO CONDUCT THE ROYAL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA 
IN BRAHMS' VARIATIONS ON THE SAINT ANTHONY CHORALE 
THE TRIUMPHANT CLOSE OF BRAHMS' VARIATIONS ON THE SAINT ANTHONY CHORALE 
PERFORMED TONIGHT AT THE PROMS BY THE ROYAL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA 
WITH LEADER CLIO GOULD CONDUCTED BY GUENNADI ROJDESTVENSKI 
WELL THERE'S A QUICK RESET NOW 
BEFORE WE HEAR A PERFORMANCE OF ELGAR'S ENIGMA VARIATIONS 
AND JUST TIME TO INTRODUCE MY GUESTS FOR THIS EVENING 
JAMES MURPHY 
MARKETING MANAGER AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MUSIC 
AND DOMINIC SELDIS 
PRINCIPAL DOUBLE BASS WITH THE B. B. C. NATIONAL ORCHESTRA OF WALES HELLO 
JAMES THOSE VARIATIONS ARE TYPICAL OF BRAHMS AREN'T THEY 
ALL THE HALLMARKS THERE OF HIS COMPOSITIONAL STYLE 
DEFINITELY HE'S SEEN AS A CLASSICIST 
IN HIS DAY LIKING COMPOSERS LIKE BACH OR ANYONE BEFORE MOZART 
WASN'T VERY COOL 
YET HE WAS TAKING MODELS THAT HADN'T BEEN USED FOR A LONG TIME 
LIKE SAY THE PASSACAGLIA WHICH WE HEAR IN THAT LAST FINALE 
THAT'S A REPEATED THEME IN THE BASS 
AND HE BROUGHT THEM BACK HE USED THEM A LOT IN HIS SYMPHONIES 
COMPOSERS AFTERWARDS LIKE BRITTEN AND SHOSTAKOVICH WOULD GO ON TO USE THEM 
SO HE WAS QUITE PROGRESSIVE 
THAT WAS HIS TAKE ON THE VARIATIONS 
NEXT WE'LL HEAR ELGAR'S HUGELY POPULAR TAKE THE ENIGMA VARIATIONS 
WHY ARE THEY SO POPULAR DOM 
WELL GENERALLY PEOPLE GET IT 
THIS IS A BONA FIDE MASTERPIECE 
OF FABULOUS ORCHESTRAL WRITING 
A GREAT ORCHESTRAL WORK AND IT'S VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND 
IT'S IN BITE SIZE CHUNKS VERY EASILY DIGESTED 
THE WHOLE MYSTERY AROUND IT IS GREAT 
YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE A MUSICOLOGY DEGREE TO UNDERSTAND IT 
IT'S JUST WONDERFUL MUSIC FROM START TO FINISH 
AND A JOY NOT ONLY LISTEN TO BUT TO WATCH 
IT REALLY WORKS THE ORCHESTRA HARD 
SO IF YOU'RE SEEING IT IN A CONCERT HALL 
IT'S REALLY A GREAT PIECE TO WATCH AS WELL 
IT'S A HUGELY POPULAR THEME 
THEN IT GETS TRANSMUTED THROUGH ALL THESE DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES 
THEY ARE TO REPRESENT ELGAR'S FRIENDS AREN'T THEY 
YEP WE HAVE THIRTEEN FRIENDS AND THEN A VERSION OF HIM AT THE END 
AND HE'S GOING FOR DIFFERENT SLANTS ON THEIR CHARACTER 
SEVERAL WERE MUSICIANS AND THEIR INSTRUMENTS ARE BROUGHT TO THE FORE 
LIKE HIS FRIEND NEVINSON WHO PLAYED CELLO 
MANIFESTED IN THE BEAUTIFUL TWELFTH VARIATION 
AND THEN THE DOG OF A FRIEND OF HIS COMES IN AT ONE POINT 
SPLASHING INTO THE RIVER WYE IN AN EPISODE OF EXCITEMENT 
AND THEN THE SEVENTH VARIATION FOR HIS FRIEND TROYTE 
COULD BE REFERRING TO THE MAN'S BLISTERY TEMPERAMENT 
BUT COULD ALSO BE THE FAMOUS THUNDER STORM THEY ONCE GOT CAUGHT IN 
MANY DIFFERENT SHADES AND SLANTS ARE AT PLAY HERE 
AND OBVIOUSLY THE NIMROD VARIATION THAT EVERYONE KNOWS 
WHAT ABOUT THAT DO YOU THINK SO CATCHES PEOPLE'S IMAGINATIONS 
I THINK IT'S RATHER SAD REALLY 
BECAUSE OF COURSE IT'S PLAYED AT FUNERALS AND STUFF 
AND THERE'S A WHOLE DARK SIDE TO IT 
BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY QUITE BEAUTIFUL 
AND OF COURSE DEPICTS A CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH HIS PUBLISHER 
ABOUT THE SLOW MOVEMENTS OF BEETHOVEN I THINK I'M RIGHT THERE 
I THINK IT'S VERY WELL MISREPRESENTED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 
AND I THINK IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF MUSIC 
BUT IT REALLY IS JUST ONE OF THOSE PIECES 
YOU SIT BACK AND JUST LET IT WASH OVER YOU 
AND IT'S A JOY TO LISTEN TO EVERY TIME 
THERE'S NO SIDE TO IT AT ALL 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY SIMPLE REVERENTIAL MUSIC IN LOVE OF HIS FRIENDS 
ABSOLUTELY YEAH THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED 
WELL HERE IS GUENNADI ROJDESTVENSKI 
RETURNING TO THE STAGE TO CONDUCT THE ROYAL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA 
IN ELGAR'S ENIGMA VARIATIONS 
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS ON FROM ITS COMPOSITION 
THAT IS MUSIC THAT STILL HAS THE POWER TO MOVE 
ELGAR'S ENIGMA VARIATIONS 
PERFORMED TONIGHT BY THE ROYAL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA 
UNDER THE DIRECTION OF GUENNADI ROJDESTVENSKI 
WELL ONE ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE ENIGMA VARIATIONS 
IS THAT AFTER A TIRING DAY OF TEACHING 
ELGAR WAS DAYDREAMING AT THE PIANO 
A MELODY HE PLAYED CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF HIS WIFE 
WHO LIKED IT AND ASKED HIM TO REPEAT IT FOR HER 
SO TO ENTERTAIN HER HE BEGAN TO IMPROVISE VARIATIONS ON THE MELODY 
AND HE EVENTUALLY EXPANDED AND ORCHESTRATED THEM 
INTO THE ENIGMA VARIATIONS 
WARM HANDSHAKE THERE FOR THE LEADER TONIGHT CLIO GOULD 
WELL WE'VE GOT AN INTERVAL NOW OF ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES 
BEFORE THE SECOND HALF OF TONIGHT'S CONCERT 
AND TWO WORKS FROM RICHARD STRAUSS 
HIS OBOE CONCERTO AND THE SUITE FROM HIS OPERA DER ROSENKAVALIER 
I'M ABOUT TO TALK TO JOHN DEATHRIDGE 
PROFESSOR OF MUSIC AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON 
ABOUT THE LIFE AND WORK OF RICHARD STRAUSS 
FOR NOW MY GUESTS JAMES MURPHY AND DOMINIC SELDIS ARE STILL WITH ME 
DOM IT'S NO WONDER THERE'S A FULL HOUSE TONIGHT 
IT'S SUCH A CROWD PLEASER 
IF YOU IMAGINE HOW MANY TIMES ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR 
THE RPO HAVE PLAYED THAT PIECE 
AND HOW THEY CAN PEG OUT A REALLY TERRIFIC PERFORMANCE LIKE THAT 
UNDER WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES 
IT'S BAKING HOT IN HERE FOR A START 
OF COURSE THEIR PRINCIPAL CONDUCTOR PULLED OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE 
THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT UNSETTLE THE BAND AND YET 
OF COURSE THEY CAN PLAY THIS MUSIC WITH THEIR EYES CLOSED 
THEY REALLY CAN THEY'RE A WORLD CLASS ORCHESTRA 
TO PUT OUT SOMETHING THAT GOOD UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES 
I JUST THINK IT'S TRULY REMARKABLE AND SIMPLY A JOY TO WATCH 
WE'VE HEARD BRAHMS VARIATIONS WE'VE HEARD ELGAR VARIATIONS 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT VARIATIONS THAT AUDIENCES JUST ENJOY 
AS DOM SAID THEY ARE CONSUMABLE THEY DON'T OUTSTAY THEIR WELCOME 
AND THERE'S AN INTRIGUE IN SEEING WHAT THE COMPOSER WILL DO NEXT 
THERE IS A DANGER THAT IT BECOMES A SHOWCASE FOR THE COMPOSER'S EGO 
LIKE HEY LOOK WHAT I CAN DO NOW 
IT'S A TRANSPARENT WAY OF COMPOSING 
LIKE LET'S TRY SOME COUNTERPOINT 
EXACTLY YEAH I ALWAYS FEEL THAT A LITTLE BIT 
WITH MOZART'S INCREDIBLY PRECOCIOUS 
TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR VARIATIONS 
BUT ELGAR PULLS OFF A BIT OF A COUP BECAUSE HE REFLECTS THAT VANITY AWAY 
BY CASTING IT ONTO HIS FRIENDS IN SUCH LOVING GENEROUS PORTRAITS 
YES I MEAN IT ALWAYS TAKES YOU A BIT BY SURPRISE 
THAT THE LAST VARIATION IS ABOUT HIM 
BUT OF COURSE IT'S THROUGH HIS WIFE'S EYES 
SO YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT 
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY MODEST PORTRAYAL OF HIS LIFE 
EVEN THOUGH OF COURSE IT'S ALL ABOUT HIM 
AND HE WAS A VERY MODEST MAN IN SOME WAYS I MEAN 
HE WAS AN OVERNIGHT SUCCESS WITH THIS PIECE 
THIS WAS HIS FIRST HUGE PIECE BUT FAME AND SUCCESS WAS NEVER SOMETHING 
HE FELT WAS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM 
INDEED THESE ARE NOT BIG FIGURES OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE 
THEY'RE INTIMATE FRIENDS FROM WORCESTER 
THIS MAN LIKED NOTHING MORE THAN TO STAND ON THE MALVERN HILLS ALONE 
WE CARVED HIM INTO THIS BIG IMPERIAL FIGURE 
I WOULD SAY THAT THE PROMS 
BY WRAPPING ALL THE FLAG WAVING AROUND POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE 
HAS MADE HIM INTO THIS KIND OF ENGLISH EMBLEM 
BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S WORTH NOTING AS WELL 
THAT WHEN HE WROTE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE 
HE TOOK ITS TITLE FROM OTHELLO WHICH ISN'T SET IN ENGLAND 
IT'S SET IN VENICE 
SO I DON'T THINK HE WAS THIS BIG JINGOISTIC PATRIARCH 
THAT WE PERCEIVE HIM AS NO 
I MEAN AT THIS POINT IN HIS LIFE HE WAS EARLY FORTIES I THINK 
AND HE HAD DONE VERY LITTLE 
IN THE SUCCESSFUL COMPOSITION STUFF BEFORE ENIGMA 
HE HAD REALLY GIVEN IT A GOOD BASH GONE TO LONDON AND COME BACK 
HE WAS BASICALLY JUST TEACHING VIOLIN AND MUSIC 
AND WAS REALLY NOT QUITE THE HEROIC ENGLISH COMPOSER THAT WE THINK 
I MEAN HE WAS PRETTY MUCH SCRAPING A LIVING 
ALONG COMES THIS ENIGMA VARIATIONS 
AND REALLY LIGHTS THE BONFIRE UNDER 
OPENS THE WHOLE DOOR ABSOLUTELY 
POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE COMES AFTER THAT ERM 
THE DREAM OF GERONTIUS WHICH Y'KNOW SOME SAY IS GREAT 
OTHER'S DON'T LIKE ME 
PEOPLE WHO SAY IT'S GREAT HAVE NEVER PLAYED IT 
AND REALLY FROM THAT POINT ON CAME SYMPHONIES 
I MEAN WE'RE TALKING SOME REALLY AMAZING MUSIC 
JUST FROM AN OVERNIGHT SUCCESS OF THIS VARIATIONS 
GOOD GREAT TO CHAT YOU GUYS WE'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER 
TIME NOW TO JOIN ZEB SOANES WHO'S IN THE GALLERY THANKS SUZY 
THROUGHOUT ELGAR'S LIFE 
HE WAS PLAGUED WITH INSECURITIES ABOUT HIS ABILITIES AS A COMPOSER 
WHICH WAS NOT HELPED BY SOME OF THE COMMENTS HE RECEIVED AT THE TIME 
THE MUSICOLOGIST ERIC BLOM WROTE 
HE WAS SINGULARLY DEVOID OF SELF CRITICISM 
AND WELCOMED WITH AN ALMOST CHILDISH DELIGHT 
ANY NOTION THAT WOULD COME TO HIM 
HE DID NOT CLEARLY KNOW WHEN HE HAD WRITTEN AN INFERIOR THING 
AND WHEN A MASTERPIECE 
HIS FELLOW COMPOSERS ALSO GOT IN ON THE ACT 
FREDERICK DELIUS WAS LESS THAN IMPRESSED WITH DREAM OF GERONTIUS 
ELGAR MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GREAT COMPOSER 
IF HE HAD THROWN ALL THAT RELIGIOUS PARAPHERNALIA OVERBOARD 
GERONTIUS IS A NAUSEATING WORK 
NEVERTHELESS HE HAD HIS FANS AND HIS SUPPORTERS 
GEORGE BERNARD SHAW VISITED HIM AND AFTER SEEING HIS PERFORMANCE OF FALSTAFF AT A PROM IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE 
WROTE HIM A LETTER HE SAID THIS 
IT'S MAGNIFICENT AND PERFECTLY GRAPHIC 
TO ANYONE WHO KNOWS SHAKESPEARE 
ALL THE GENIUSES WHOM I VENTURE TO ADMIRE 
LET ME DOWN ONE TIME OR ANOTHER BUT YOU NEVER FAIL 
THE COMPOSER GRANVILLE BANTOCK CONCURRED 
AND SAID OF ELGAR'S DREAM CHILDREN 
PERFORMED AT A PROM IN THE QUEEN'S HALL IN NINETEEN OH TWO 
IF ELGAR NEVER WRITES ANOTHER NOTE OF MUSIC 
I WILL SAY THAT HE IS A GIANT AND OVERTOPS US ALL 
WHEN ELGAR DIED IN NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN DUBBED HIM 
THE LAUREATE OF ENGLISH MUSIC 
AND OBSERVED NO WORTHIER TRIBUTE COULD BE OFFERED 
THAN TO SAY THAT HIS DEATH WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THIS COUNTRY 
BY THE PUBLIC AT LARGE 
WELL CLEARLY HE WAS A MAN WHO COURTED CONTROVERSY 
BUT I THINK HE EARNED HIS PLACE IN MUSICAL HISTORY 
IF YOU WERE IN ANY DOUBT AT ALL I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS LAST THOUGHT 
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM THERE ARE SIXTY FIVE ROADS NAMED AFTER EDWARD ELGAR 
AND SIX OF THOSE IN THE COUNTIES OF HEREFORDSHIRE AND WORCESTERSHIRE 
SO I THINK THAT PROVES THAT WE'RE A NATION OF ELGAR LOVERS 
THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE PASSING ELGAR AVENUE YOU CAN TOOT YOUR HORN 
SUZY BACK TO YOU GREAT BIT OF MUSIC TRIVIA THANKS ZEB 
I'M DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED BY JOHN DEATHRIDGE 
WHO'LL BE TALKING TO US ABOUT THE LATE MUSIC OF RICHARD STRAUSS 
OF WHICH WE WILL HEAR TWO PIECES LATER IN THE CONCERT 
HIS OBOE CONCERTO AND THE SUITE FROM HIS OPERA DER ROSENKAVALIER 
JOHN IT'S LOVELY TO BE JOINED BY YOU 
WHEN WE SAY LATE STRAUSS 
WHAT DO WE MEAN BY THAT IN TERMS OF SOUND AND STYLE 
I'D FIRST LIKE TO SAY THERE ARE LOTS OF ROADS IN GERMANY 
LATE STYLE THIS IS A COMPLICATED THING 
WITH STRAUSS IT'S A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS 
LATE STYLE YOU ASSOCIATE WITH BEETHOVEN RATHER MELANCHOLY 
RATHER FRAGMENTED MUSIC 
THE LATE STYLE OF STRAUSS IS ACTUALLY RATHER LIGHT SOME OF IT 
IT CAN ALSO BE QUITE MONUMENTALLY MELANCHOLIC IN THE METAMORPHOSEN 
WITHIN THE OBOE CONCERTO THAT WE'LL HEAR TONIGHT 
IT'S A RETURN TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
QUITE A LIGHT WAY OF ENDING YOUR LIFE 
IN FACT I THINK STRAUSS THOUGHT OF LATE STYLE 
AS REVISITING HIS EARLIER LIFE AS WELL AS SUMMING IT UP 
BUT IN A VERY POSITIVE ALMOST ELEGIAC WAY 
THERE'S A SENSE OF THE WEIGHT OF LEGACY 
OF A COMPOSER CONCERNED WITH WHAT HE WOULD LEAVE AS A BODY OF WORK 
YES I THINK THAT'S TRUE AND I THINK HE IS WRITING HIS OWN EPITAPHS 
HE'S WRITING A SERIES OF THEM BECAUSE HE HAD SO MANY DIFFERENT STYLES 
AND HE EXPERIMENTED WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS 
BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT LATE STRAUSS 
IS THAT HE'S ALSO THINKING OF THE END OF A GERMAN TRADITION 
BECAUSE THERE'S NO QUESTION MANY LETTERS SAY THIS 
THAT HE SAW HIMSELF HISTORICALLY 
AS CONTINUING THE NEW GERMAN TRADITION OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THAT MEANS CARRYING ON FROM BEETHOVEN VIA BERLIOZ 
WHO WAS CO OPTED BY THE GERMANS 
AND LISZT WHO WAS ALSO CO OPTED BY THE GERMANS AND WAGNER 
STRAUSS SAW HIMSELF AS A KIND OF MOUNTAIN TOP 
EVEN THOUGH HE CALLED HIMSELF THE FOOTHILLS 
HE SAW HIMSELF AS CONTINUING THIS TRADITION 
THERE'S ALSO A SENSE IN HIS LATE WORKS THAT THIS IS COMING TO AN END 
SO IT'S AN EPITAPH NOT ONLY TO HIMSELF 
BUT TO A WHOLE TRADITION GOING BACK MANY YEARS 
OF COURSE HE WAS BORN DURING THE AGE OF WAGNER 
HE DIES DURING THE AGE OF BOULEZ 
SO IT'S A TREMENDOUSLY TURBULENT PERIOD OF MUSIC HISTORY 
OH YES NOT ONLY THAT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER 
STRAUSS WAS VERY FAMOUS WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG 
HE WAS CONDUCTING WHEN HE WAS TWENTY FIVE 
HE WAS WORLD FAMOUS WHEN HE WAS TWENTY NINE 
AND HE WAS CONDUCTING THE BERLIN PHILHARMONIC IN HIS EARLY THIRTIES 
I MEAN WHERE DO YOU GO FROM THERE ANOTHER FIFTY YEARS ON 
SO HE HAS TO KEEP RE INVENTING HIMSELF 
A LITTLE BIT LIKE STRAVINSKY IN THIS SENSE 
THE MORE HE REINVENTS HIMSELF 
THE MORE HE BECOMES CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN TRADITION 
WHICH IS NOT THE SCHOENBERG TRADITION 
EVERYBODY ACCUSES SCHOENBERG OF THINKING OF HIMSELF HISTORICALLY BUT STRAUSS WAS JUST AS BAD 
BUT GERMAN MUSIC MEANT FOR STRAUSS 
IT MEANT ALSO OTHER STYLES HE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN FRENCH MUSIC 
IN FACT THE OBOE CONCERTO HAS A FRENCH TASTE TO IT YOU KNOW 
THIS EXQUISITE SOUND THAT HE LIKES TO BRING OUT 
THE WAY HE HANDLES THE WOODWIND INSTRUMENTS 
YOU CAN SEE HE'S BEEN READING BERLIOZ ORCHESTRAL TREATISE 
THE WHOLE TASTE OF THAT IS QUITE INTERNATIONAL 
AND I THINK IT'S AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY VIEW 
IN THE SENSE THAT GERMAN COMPOSERS IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SAW THEMSELVES 
AS CO OPTING OTHER STYLES WHICH THEY ALWAYS CLAIM THEY CAN DO BETTER 
THAN THE FRENCH OR THE ITALIANS OR SO FORTH 
THERE'S A BIT OF THIS IN STRAUSS AS WELL ESPECIALLY TOWARDS THE END 
WELL AT THE BEGINNING HE BEGAN VERY MUCH AS A CONSCIOUS INNOVATOR 
TONE POEMS AND THEN AT THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY EMBARKS ON OPERAS 
NOTABLY SALOME ELEKTRA AND THEN SUDDENLY WITH DER ROSENKAVALIER 
THERE'S A VERY MARKED CHANGE IN DIRECTION 
WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT POINT 
WELL I THINK HE FELT HE NEEDED TO GO IN A NEW DIRECTION 
SO THE EMPHASIS IS ON THE NEW HERE 
HE DIDN'T SEE IT AS GOING BACKWARDS 
HE SAW VISITING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IN THIS ANACHRONISTIC WAY 
HAVING THESE NINETEENTH CENTURY WALTZES IN AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CONTEXT 
AGAIN THE ORIGIN IS FRANCE 
HOFMANNSTHAL READ A LOT OF FRENCH NOVELS AND FRENCH PLAYS 
TO GET THIS FARCICAL ELEMENT IN IT 
BUT IT'S ALSO A VERY SERIOUS ELEMENT IN A SENSE 
AS IN MOLIERE AND MANY EIGHTEENTH CENTURY FRENCH PLAYS 
YOU GET THE IDEA OF PEOPLE IN A SOCIETY THAT'S NO LONGER PRESENT 
THAT COULD COLLAPSE AT ANY TIME 
AND OF COURSE THAT HAS JUST AS MUCH RELEVANCE 
TO THE YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
AS THE MOST ATONAL WORKS OF SCHOENBURG IN MANY WAYS 
ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID 
STYLISTICALLY HE SEEMS TO GO BACK TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
IN FACT I DON'T THINK HE DOES 
HE'S REINVENTING HIMSELF AND HE CONTINUES TO DO SO REMARKABLY 
NOT ALWAYS WITH GOOD PIECES 
BUT HE'S TRYING TO UPHOLD THIS GERMAN TRADITION AS HE SEES IT 
HE WAS ACCUSED OF ANACHRONISM DURING THIS PERIOD AND OF SENTIMENTALITY 
IT WAS QUITE BRUTAL CRITICISM BY THE MODERNISTS 
YES THE MODERNISTS COULDN'T STAND IT 
BECAUSE THEY ONLY SAW MODERNIST MUSIC IN A CERTAIN WAY 
MODERNISM CAN MEAN A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL 
IF YOU LOOK AT STRAVINSKY'S NEOCLASSICAL WORKS FOR EXAMPLE 
WHICH ARE ALSO MODERNIST IN THEIR WAY 
IT'S JUST THAT THE SORT OF MODERNISTS 
THAT ACCUSED STRAUSS OF BEING REACTIONARY 
HAD A RATHER LUTHERAN APPROACH TO WHAT MUSICAL PROGRESS SHOULD BE 
THERE'S ALSO A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE MUSICAL QUALITY OF STRAUSS IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES 
AND THAT IS ACTUALLY A CRITICISM THAT STRAUSS HIMSELF TOOK TO HEART 
THERE ARE SOME VERY WEAK WORKS THERE 
BUT THE THING ABOUT STRAUSS IS 
BECAUSE HE WAS ACTUALLY SCHOOLED IN COMPOSERS LIKE BRAHMS 
VERY GOOD TRAINING EVEN THE BAD PIECES ARE INCREDIBLY WELL COMPOSED 
AND IT'S ALMOST A JOY TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THE BAD PIECES 
OVER SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE COMPOSED AT THE TIME 
SO HE WAS A PRETTY GOOD COMPOSER 
LIKE SHOSTAKOVICH PROKOFIEV OTHER BIG COMPOSERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
STRAUSS IS ONE OF THOSE FIGURES 
WHO CAN'T SEEM TO ESCAPE HIS PERIOD IN HISTORY 
AND HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO LIVED THROUGH VERY TURBULENT TIMES 
HOW DID HE RESPOND TO THAT 
WELL I THINK HE RESPONDED PARADOXICALLY 
I THINK HE SAW HIMSELF AS MODERN 
PRECISELY BECAUSE HE BELONGED TO AN EARLIER PERIOD 
BECAUSE IF YOU SEE THE WORLD AROUND YOU COLLAPSING IN YOUR OWN EYES 
THEN YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE UPHOLDING SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE THERE 
BUT ISN'T THERE 
YOU CAN FEEL YOURSELF TO BE MORE UP TO DATE HE USED TO SAY TO PEOPLE 
UNLESS YOU CAN COMPOSE LIKE MOZART AND BEETHOVEN YOU'RE NOT REALLY MODERN 
HE WAS SAYING THIS IN THE THIRTIES AND HE SAID 
MY IDEA OF MODERNISM IS FOR THIS CULTURE TO GO ON FOR THE NEXT TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
SO IT'S A SORT OF STEADY STATE YOU SEE 
NOT CONTINUOUS PROGRESS 
BUT BY DINT OF THE FACT THAT THE WORLD IS COLLAPSING AROUND US 
I THINK I AM MORE MODERN BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT THE OLD VALUES ARE 
AND ALL THE TIME HE WAS BEING ACTUALLY VERY INNOVATIVE AND NEW 
SO IN A WAY HE WAS CONTRADICTING HIMSELF 
AND PARTICULARLY THE LAST WORKS SHOW GREAT FRESHNESS OF INVENTION 
AND DOING WONDERFUL THINGS IN THE OBOE CONCERTO WITH FORM INSTRUMENTATION 
THESE WONDERFUL COUNTERPOINTS BETWEEN COR ANGLAIS AND OBOE AND SO FORTH 
THESE ARE ALL VERY NEW SOUNDS ACTUALLY 
WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THOSE AND MORE 
JOHN IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE PLEASURE 
LET'S NOW GO BACK TO ZEB SOANES 
THANKS SUZY WELL I'M JOINED NOW BY KEVIN JONES 
WHO'S FORMER PROFESSOR OF MUSIC AT KINGSTON UNIVERSITY 
AND HE SHARES ELGAR'S LOVE OF CODES AND ENIGMAS 
KEVIN WE'VE JUST HEARD THE ENIGMA VARIATIONS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT THAT PIECE IN PARTICULAR 
THAT SO CAPTIVATES AUDIENCES 
THERE ARE THREE THINGS WHICH RELATE TO THIS 
ONE IS ELGAR HAD THIS VERY SENSITIVE CHARACTER 
NOW WE'RE REALISING A MUCH MORE NUANCED VIEW OF ELGAR'S CHARACTER 
HE ISN'T THE STUFFY OLD COLONEL TYPE WITH THE BIG MOUSTACHE 
THAT PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM IN THE PAST 
BUT HE WAS A VERY SENSITIVE SOUL HAD THESE GREAT MOOD SWINGS 
BUT THERE WERE EXTAORDINARY SIDES TO HIS CHARACTER 
BECAUSE HE WAS A SENSITIVE SOUL HE HAD GREAT EMPATHY FOR OTHER PEOPLE 
AND I THINK THAT COMES OUT IN THESE VARIATIONS 
YOU CAN REALLY SEE HOW HE GETS INSIDE THE SKIN OF HIS FRIENDS 
HE WASN'T TRYING TO DO PORTRAITS OF THEM 
HE WAS TRYING TO WRITE THE MUSIC THEY WOULD HAVE WRITTEN 
IF THEY WERE COMPOSERS 
IT'S A SUPER RANGE OF DIFFERENT STYLES AND APPROACHES THAT HE MANAGES TO GET THERE 
I THINK THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE ACTUAL ENIGMA MELODY ITSELF IS VERY STRANGE 
IT'S A DISTINCTLY ODD MELODY IT'S GOT THIS VERY CURIOUS STRUCTURE 
YOU'VE GOT TWO SHORT NOTES AND TWO LONG NOTES D. A. D. A. DAH DAH 
AND THEN EXACTLY THE SAME THING SWAPPED AROUND IT'S REPEATED IT'S A MIRROR IMAGE DAH DAH D. A. D. A. 
AND THAT'S REPEATED THREE TIMES 
IT'S THE SORT OF SYMMETRY THAT A MODERNIST COMPOSER IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
LIKE MESSIAEN OR WEBERN WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD OF 
ELGAR WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME WASN'T HE 
IN MANY RESPECTS HE WAS A TRUE VICTORIAN MAN 
THAT'S RIGHT HE WAS VERY KEEN ON SCIENCE AND PARTICULARLY CHEMISTRY 
YOU TOLD ME HE PARTICULARLY LIKED CREATING SMELLS THAT'S RIGHT 
IN WHAT WAY 
IF YOU LOOK THROUGH SOME OF HIS CHEMISTRY TEXTBOOKS 
IT'S ALL THE STUFF THAT MAKES THE WORST SMELLS 
THAT HE'S HIGHLIGHTED 
AND IT'S KNOWN THAT HE CREATED RATHER TOO MANY SMELLS 
WHICH PROBABLY WASN'T APPRECIATED BY HIS WIFE ALICE 
BUT IN ANOTHER HOUSE THAT HE MOVED TO 
HE HAD A CONVERTED AREA THAT HE CALLED HIS ARC 
WHICH WAS A FULLY KITTED OUT LABORATORY 
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF INTERESTING STORIES 
WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT CERTAIN CHEMICALS 
FALLING INTO CERTAIN SCORES 
AND A GREAT EPISODE OF WHEN HE CREATED AN EXPLOSION 
THAT RESOUNDED THROUGH THE WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD 
AND CREATED QUITE A STIR 
SO HE WAS A PRACTICAL JOKER 
WHERE DID THIS LOVE OF CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY COME FROM 
WELL GOING BACK TO WHAT YOU WERE SAYING 
THE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING CHARACTERISTIC THAT RELATES TO THE ENIGMA MELODY 
IT WAS SO STRANGE IT JUST DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A NORMAL MELODY 
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE VARIATIONS WORK SO SUCCESSFULLY 
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THIS EXTRAORDINARY SYMMETRY 
WHERE YOU'VE GOT ONE MOTIF ANSWERED BY ITS REVERSE 
YOU'VE GOT THE SAME REPEATED AGAIN A LITTLE BIT HIGHER 
IT ALMOST FORMS LIKE A GOTHIC WINDOW 
AND IT'S SO DISTINCTIVE THAT WHEN HE COMES TO DO HIS VARIATIONS 
YOU CAN ALWAYS HEAR THAT IN THE BACKGROUND 
IT HELPS BIND THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER 
BECAUSE THERE ARE PUZZLES WITHIN PUZZLES 
THE FIRST ONE WHICH JAMES MENTIONED EARLIER 
IS THAT THE INITIALS OF ELGAR'S FRIENDS WERE GIVEN TO EACH OF THE VARIATIONS THAT'S RIGHT YES 
BUT THE SECOND PUZZLE WHICH IS MORE MYSTERIOUS 
IS THAT THERE WAS A THEME WHICH GOES BUT IS NOT HEARD WHAT'S THAT 
THAT'S RIGHT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO RECKON 
BECAUSE IN THE ORIGINAL PROGRAMME NOTE THE REFERENCE TO THE THEME 
COULD BE INTERPRETED AS JUST A GENERAL IDEA 
BUT ACTUALLY THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER RECORDS THAT DO SUGGEST 
THAT IT WAS DEFINITELY A MATCHING MELODY 
THERE WAS AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED WITH HIM IN THE MUSICAL TIMES 
A YEAR AFTER HE WROTE THE VARIATIONS IN NINETEEN HUNDRED 
WHERE THE WRITER EXPLICITLY REFERS TO ANOTHER PHRASE 
A WELL KNOWN PHRASE WHICH CAN BE PUT ABOVE THE ORIGINAL THEME BUT WHAT THAT THEME IS 
PEOPLE SUGGESTED AULD LANG SYNE OR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM 
BUT YOU DISCOUNT THOSE DO YOU ELGAR HIMSELF DISCOUNTED THOSE 
HE WAS ASKED BY HIS FRIENDS WHO SUGGESTED THESE 
AND HE SPECIFICALLY RULED THEM OUT 
BUT HE ALSO KNEW MORSE CODE DIDN'T HE 
WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH 
BARRINGTON PHELOUNG'S THEME FOR THE INSPECTOR MORSE SERIES 
WHICH ALLEGEDLY HAD THESE MYSTERIOUS CODES 
BUT ELGAR WAS WAY AHEAD OF THAT WASN'T HE 
ELGAR KNEW MORSE CODE AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT ONE OF HIS FRIENDS 
DORA PENNY DORABELLA OF THE VARIATIONS KNEW MORSE CODE 
AND I HAVE A THEORY THAT THERE'S MORSE CODE 
IN THE ORIGINAL ENIGMA MELODY 
IF YOU INTERPRET THE TWO DOTS AS AN I AND THE TWO DASHES AS AN M. 
AND YOU REVERSE THAT YOU GET I M. M. I. 
WHICH IS LIKE I AM AM I 
SO REALLY I MEAN AS I WAS SAYING A FEW MINUTES AGO 
ABOUT ELGAR BEING FIERCELY CRITICISED 
REALLY HE'S BLOWING A BIG RASPBERRY AND SAYING I AM LIGHTWEIGHT AM I 
WELL YES THAT'S RIGHT 
IT'S CLEAR AT THE TIME HE WROTE THESE VARIATIONS 
FROM THE THINGS HE REPORTED LATER 
THE WAY THAT HE QUOTED THIS MATERIAL IN LATER WORKS 
LIKE THE MUSIC PAPERS 
HE WROTE THIS AT A TIME WHEN HE WAS FEELING PRETTY LOW 
OR HE STARTED AT A TIME WHEN HE WAS FEELING PRETTY LOW 
AND SOME OF HIS FRIENDS DO SUGGEST 
THAT HE WAS CLEARLY DEEPLY DEEPLY HURT BY SOME BITING CRITICISM 
AT SOME STAGE 
HE ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER 
THE FACT THAT HE WAS A ROMAN CATHOLIC 
AT A TIME WHEN BEING ROMAN CATHOLIC WAS SEEN AS BEING A BIT ON THE EDGE 
AND HIS BACKGROUND WAS FAIRLY MODEST 
SO SOME PEOPLE SAID SOME VERY UNKIND THINGS TO HIM 
BUT THE MUSIC ASIDE THERE IS ANOTHER CODE THAT HAS ALL THE MAKINGS OF A BLOCKBUSTER NOVEL 
YOU CAN FORGET THE D. A. VINCI CODE THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED RIGHT 
AND THAT'S THE DORABELLA THAT YOU MENTIONED OR THE DORA PENNY CODE 
YES NOW DORA PENNY WAS THE NAME OF HIS YOUNG FRIEND 
AND DORABELLA WAS THE NICKNAME HE USED FOR HER IN THE VARIATIONS 
SO IT'S KNOWN AS THE DORABELLA CODE 
WE CAN SEE THAT ON SCREEN NOW 
OR THE DORABELLA CIPHER 
TO ME THAT JUST LOOKS LIKE MAGGOTS OR SQUIGGLES 
WELL SOMEBODY DESCRIBED IT IN A BOOK ON CODE BREAKING 
AS A FLOCK OF SHEEP RIGHT 
SUZY BACK TO YOU 
THANKS ZEB WE CERTAINLY ARE A NATION OF ELGAR LOVERS 
IF YOUR EMAILS AND TEXTS ARE ANYTHING TO GO BY 
ONE HERE FROM GRAHAM VOYS WHO SAYS ELGAR IS NOT SOLELY AN ENGLISH COMPOSER 
THIS CONDUCTOR PUT HIM WHERE HE BELONGS A GENIUS OF THE LATE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT 
AND MANY MORE OF YOU HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH TO SAY SIMILAR THINGS 
OBVIOUSLY HUGE FANS OF ELGAR OUT THERE 
ANYWAY WE'VE A FEW MINUTES NOW WITH THE PROMMERS CHANTING DOWNSTAIRS 
BEFORE WE GO TO THE SECOND HALF OF TONIGHT'S CONCERT TWO WORKS BY RICHARD STRAUSS 
THE SUITE FROM HIS OPERA DER ROSENKAVALIER 
AND BEFORE THAT THE OBOE CONCERTO 
PERFORMED TONIGHT BY THE YOUNG RUSSIAN SOLOIST ALEXEI OGRINTCHOUK 
MAKING HIS PROMS DEBUT AT THE AGE OF JUST TWENTY SIX 
STILL WITH ME ARE MY GUESTS JAMES MURPHY AND DOM SELDIS 
DOM WE WERE TALKING EARLIER TO JOHN DEATHRIDGE 
IF YOU CAN HEAR ABOVE ALL THE NOISE 
WE WERE TALKING EARLIER TO JOHN DEATHRIDGE 
ABOUT LATE STRAUSS' MUSICAL STYLE 
WHERE WAS STRAUSS IN HIS PERSONAL AND POLITICAL LIFE 
WHEN THESE WERE WRITTEN 
WELL THIS IS ALL REALLY SAD ACTUALLY AS JOHN BRILLIANTLY SAID 
HE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY CAREER AND BY THE TIME WE GET TO THIS POINT 
HE'S LATE SEVENTIES EARLY EIGHTIES AND IT'S NINETEEN FORTY FIVE THINGS ARE NOT GOING WELL 
HE HAS TO FLEE TO SWITZERLAND 
DUE TO THE FACT HE HAD CONNECTIONS WITH THE HITLER MOVEMENT 
MORE AS A CAREER MOVE THAN BECAUSE OF HIS POLITICAL SWAY 
HE WAS A VERY CANNY GUY WAS STRAUSS 
AND SO HE HAD TO MOVE TO SWITZERLAND AND HE WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT HIS SON BECAUSE HE MARRIED A JEW 
AND OF COURSE THEIR GRAND CHILDREN AND THEY WERE PUT UNDER HOUSE ARREST IN VIENNA 
IT WAS A REALLY AWFUL TIME 
OF COURSE HIS OPERA HOUSES HIS FAVOURITE OPERA HOUSES WERE BEING BOMBED LEFT RIGHT AND CENTRE 
TERRIBLE TIME REMARKABLE THAT HE'S ABLE TO PRODUCE SUCH BRILLIANT MUSIC BEAUTIFUL MUSIC 
SUCH AN OPTIMISTIC AND SUNNY PIECE AS WELL 
YEAH QUITE 
IT'S A JOYFUL MOZARTEAN BEAUTIFUL CONCERTO YOU'D NEVER GUESS WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HIS LIFE 
IT'S PROBABLY THE SUNNIEST PIECE TO COME OUT OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
IN THE SAME YEAR AS METAMORPHOSEN 
SO TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS IN ONE YEAR FROM STRAUSS YEAH 
BUT IT'S STILL A BIG ROMANTIC CONCERTO 
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE NODS TO MOZART BUT THE HARMONIC LANGUAGE 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOLOIST AND ORCHESTRA 
IT IS ALSO A ROMANTIC CONCERTO ISN'T IT 
YES IT IS BUT WITH A VERY PAIRED DOWN ORCHESTRA 
THE ORCHESTRA IS SMALLER THERE'S MUCH LESS WIND 
IF YOU COMPARE IT TO HIS TONE POEMS WHICH ARE JUST MASSIVE 
I MEAN A MASSIVE BANK OF HORNS IT'S VERY VERY MUCH SMALLER 
HE USES THE HARMONIES AND THE WAY THEY WORK 
AND THE PLAY OFF BETWEEN THE SOLOIST AND YOU KNOW 
IN A REALLY NICELY PAIRED DOWN WAY AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO SWEET 
THERE'S NOTHING HEAVY ABOUT IT 
APART FROM OF COURSE FOR THE POOR SOLOIST 
TO GET THROUGH IT 
I MEAN AN EXHAUSTING PIECE 
THESE THREE MOVEMENTS RUN INTO EACH OTHER 
THERE'S NO LET UP AT ALL FOR THE SOLOIST 
I MEAN AS A SOLOIST YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY LUNG CONTROL 
OR YOU'LL END UP WITH FACE LIKE A PICKLED BEETROOT BY THE END OF IT 
THANKFULLY THIS GUY 
I HEARD HIM REHEARSE AND HE HAS THE VIRTUOSITY AND BEAUTIFUL RUSSIAN WARMTH AND LYRICISM HE HAS IT ALL 
YEAH IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AND ARE NOT A GREAT FAN OF THE OBOE 
I MEAN IT'S NOT THE PRETTIEST OF INSTRUMENTS I THINK 
OH HOW DARE YOU CONTROVERSIAL 
BUT I WILL QUALIFY THAT BY SAYING THAT THIS CAT CAN REALLY PLAY IT 
IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES OF ALMOST SOLID PLAYING 
A YOUNG OBOIST AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE CALLED MICHAEL O'DONNELL 
WAS TELLING ME THAT IN AMERICA THEY FOUND IT TOO HARD 
SO A LOT OF THE ORCHESTRAS WOULD GIVE A LOT OF THE SOLO PART 
TO THE CLARINET AND THE HORN AS A BIT OF A COP OUT REALLY 
WELL THAT WAS THE FIRST RECORDING THAT WAS EVER MADE OF IT 
BY THE GUY THAT SORT OF INSPIRED STRAUSS TO WRITE IT 
WHEN HE EVENTUALLY CAME TO RECORD IT 
HE USED THAT ORCHESTRATION SO HE COULD TAKE A BREATH 
I MEAN IT REALLY IS ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY 
BUT I BELIEVE WE'RE DOING THE FULL BLOWN MARATHON VERSION THIS EVENING 
IT IS A SWEET STORY JOHN DE LANCIE AN AMERICAN SOLDIER ASKED STRAUSS TO WRITE THIS CONCERTO 
YES HE WAS JUST ON A PATROL IN STRAUSS' HOME TOWN ROUND ABOUT NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
THEY GOT TALKING BECAUSE HE WAS SO FAMOUS JOHN DE LANCIE KNEW OF HIM 
JOHN DE LANCIE WAS AN OBOIST WITH THE PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
AND SAID BOLDLY TO STRAUSS 
I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE OBOE IN DON JUAN 
WHY DON'T YOU WRITE AN OBOE CONCERTO 
STRAUSS SAID NO 
BUT A FEW MONTHS LATER DE LANCIE'S BROTHER SENT HIM A CUTTING FROM A NEWSPAPER 
DECIDED TO WRITE A CONCERTO 
YEAH IT'S FANTASTIC LOVELY 
HE DIDN'T GET TO GIVE THE CONCERTO SADLY FOR JOHN DE LANCIE 
NO UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S THIS WEIRD THING IN AMERICA 
THAT YOU CAN'T DO A CONCERTO 
HE WAS THE YOUNGER OF THE OBOE PRINCIPALS 
SO WHEN IT CAME OVER TO AMERICA 
IN ACTUAL FACT I BELIEVE THE PRINCIPAL OBOE DIDN'T LIKE IT 
HE WENT TO LONDON TO HAVE A LOOK DIDN'T LIKE IT 
IT TOOK A LONG TIME BEFORE JOHN DE LANCIE WAS ABLE TO RECORD IT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO BOTH OF YOU HERE IS GUENNADI ROJDESTVENSKI 
AND TONIGHT'S SOLOIST ALEXEI OGRINTCHOUK 
MAKING HIS PROMS DEBUT 
RICHARD STRAUSS' OBOE CONCERTO 
WELL WE'VE ALREADY HAD A TEXT IN FROM MARILYN DENNIS IN LITTLEHAMPTON 
WHO SAYS WHAT POISE ELEGANCE AND BEAUTY OF SOUND FROM THIS YOUNG RUSSIAN SOLOIST 
I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE 
I'M SURE WE'LL BE HEARING MUCH MORE FROM ALEXEI OGRINTCHOUK IN FUTURE 
TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD B. B. C. RADIO THREE NEW GENERATIONS ARTIST 
WHO MADE HIS PROMS DEBUT HERE TONIGHT AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
THAT WAS STRAUSS' OBOE CONCERTO IN D. MAJOR 
PERFORMED OF COURSE BY ALEXEI OGRINTCHOUK 
WITH THE ROYAL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA 
CONDUCTED BY GUENNADI ROJDESTVENSKI 
ALEXEI OGRINTCHOUK TOLD US EARLIER 
THAT THIS IS THE CONCERTO FOR HIM TO PLAY 
OUT OF ALL THE OBOE REPERTOIRE 
HE FEELS THAT ALL LIFE IS IN THIS PIECE ALEXEI SAID 
AT THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR HOW DID STRAUSS MANAGE TO WRITE A PIECE SO FULL OF LIGHT 
ALEXEI OGRINTCHOUK SAYS THIS PIECE WILL BE WITH HIM 
THROUGHOUT ALL OF HIS MUSICAL LIFE 
EVERY TIME HE OPENS THIS SCORE HE FINDS SOMETHING NEW TO INSPIRE HIM 
HE SAYS THAT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL IS A MOST SPECIAL PLACE 
AND THAT IT'S A JOY AND A BIG RESPONSIBILITY TO PLAY HERE 
THERE'S JUST A QUICK RESET NOW BEFORE THE FINAL WORK IN TONIGHT'S CONCERT 
THE SUITE FROM STRAUSS' OPERA DER ROSENKAVALIER 
BEFORE THAT JAMES MURPHY AND DOM SELDIS ARE STILL WITH ME 
DOM WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT BLINDING ABSOLUTELY BLINDING 
THAT'S REALLY INCREDIBLE TO STAND UP THERE 
HALF AN HOUR OF PRETTY MUCH SOLID PLAYING AND KEEP THAT COMPOSURE 
THE AMAZING MUSICAL FLOW GOING THROUGH IT 
AND IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS HAVING SUCH A GOOD TIME 
IT WAS A JOY TO WATCH WASN'T IT 
IT'S RARE AND REFRESHING TO HAVE AN OBOE CONCERTO AT THE PROMS 
AND ONE GETS A FEELING OF THE PIED PIPER 
WITH ALL THESE THOUSANDS OF FOLLOWERS 
WATCHING THIS GUY WITH HIS INSTRUMENT 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL PLAYING 
WELL FROM THE LYRICISM OF THAT PIECE 
TO THE RATHER MORE EROTIC TERRITORY NOW OF THE DER ROSENKAVALIER SUITE 
JAMES STRAUSS THROWS US IMMEDIATELY 
INTO THIS VERY SEXY MUSICAL WORLD DOESN'T HE 
DEFINITELY HE WANTED TO MAKE HIS OWN MOZARTEAN COMEDY AND HIS OWN LITTLE SPIN ON THE JOHANN STRAUSS WALTZES 
BUT HE DOES THAT BY THROWING INCREDIBLE ORCHESTRAL COLOUR AT IT 
FROM THE START WE HEAR THESE RAVISHING BREATHLESS STRINGS 
AND I THINK PARTICULARLY IN THE PRESENTATION SCENE 
THESE AMAZING HIGH WOODWIND AND HARP CHROMATIC CHORDS 
WHICH SEND SHIVERS UP THE SPINE THEY ARE INTENSELY EROTIC 
IT KIND OF OPENS WITH A RATHER INTIMATE POST COITAL SCENE ONE MIGHT SAY TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE OPERA 
HOW DOES THE OPERA TRANSLATE ITSELF INTO THIS SUITE 
WELL THE OPERA HAS FOUR MAIN CHARACTERS 
YOU'VE GOT THE PRINCESS AN OLD BIRD BUT VERY TASTY A YUMMY MUMMY IF YOU LIKE 
WHO'S HAVING AN ADULTEROUS AFFAIR WITH A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD COUNTRY BUMPKIN 
LET ME TELL YOU EVERY SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD BOY'S ABSOLUTE DREAM COME TRUE 
THEN YOU HAVE HER COUSIN WHO IS BARON OCHS 
AND HE WANTS TO MARRY THE LOVELY SOPHIE 
WHO IS THE DAUGHTER OF A NOUVEAU RICHE MERCHANT 
SO THE OPERA GOES THEY'RE HAVING A THING THE PRINCESS AND OCTAVIAN 
THEY GET DISTURBED BY WHO THEY THINK IS HER HUSBAND BUT IT'S NOT IT'S BARON OCHS 
HE'S COME TO SPEAK TO THE PRINCESS 
ABOUT HOW HE SHOULD PROPOSE TO SOPHIE 
SHE SUGGESTS SENDING A CAVALIER A KNIGHT OF THE ROSE 
TO SEND A SILVER ROSE TO SOPHIE AND SHE SUGGESTS SENDING OCTAVIAN 
ARE YOU WITH ME SO FAR 
JUST ABOUT O. K. STICK WITH IT 
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE END OF IT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS 
WHEN THE SUITE STARTS WE HEAR THE OPENING MUSIC WE THEN HEAR 
CLASSIC MUSICAL MEANS THERE 
HUGE ASCENDING SURGING CHORDS HORNS APLENTY 
I'M SCARED I'M GONNA SWEAR OR SAY SOMETHING RUDE 
SO I THINK WE'LL LEAVE THAT UP TO THE IMAGINATION 
SO WE HAVE THE OPENING SCENE 
WE THEN HAVE THE LOVE DUET WITHIN THE SUITE 
WE HAVE THE PRESENTATION OF THE ROSE MUSIC WHICH IS EXQUISITE 
AND THEN ENDING WITH A FINALE AND THE TRIO OF THE PRINCESS OCTAVIAN AND SOPHIE 
AND EVENTUALLY SOPHIE AND OCTAVIAN GO OFF TWO YOUNG BIRDS 
YOUNG PEOPLE TOGETHER FLY THE NEST LEAVING THE OLD BIRD BY HERSELF 
BEAUTIFULLY SUMMED UP THERE NOW THERE'S THE OBVIOUS FINGERPRINTS OF MOZART'S FIGARO ALL OVER THIS 
THERE'S ALSO JOHANN STRAUSS NO RELATION TO RICHARD STRAUSS 
BUT THE WALTZES OF JOHANN STRAUSS ALSO MAKE THEIR MARK ON THIS PIECE 
IT'S VERY VIENNESE I ALSO THINK HE'S CHANNELLING THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES 
THERE'S A LOT OF THE COLOUR OF GUSTAV KLIMT'S PAINTINGS IN THIS ORCHESTRATION AS WELL 
IT IS THE JOYFULNESS THE SEDUCTION OF A WHOLE CITY AND THE WHOLE WORLD 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED TO BOTH OF YOU 
COMING ONTO THE STAGE FOR THE LAST TIME IS GUENNADI ROJDESTVENSKI 
TO CONDUCT THE ROYAL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA IN STRAUSS' SUITE FROM DER ROSENKAVALIER 
THE SUITE FROM STRAUSS' DER ROSENKAVALIER 
PERFORMED BY THE ROYAL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA 
UNDER GUENNADI ROJDESTVENSKY 
WELL DER ROSENKAVALIER WAS STRAUSS' FIFTH OPERA 
AND ITS SUBJECT MATTER WAS HOTLY DEBATED BY STRAUSS 
AND HIS LIBRETTIST HOFMANNSTHAL BEFORE THE PIECE WAS COMPOSED 
ORIGINALLY STRAUSS INTENDED TO WRITE A THIRD IN HIS SERIES OF TRAGIC OPERAS 
COMING OFF THE HEALS OF SALOME AND ELEKTRA 
EVENTUALLY THOUGH HOFMANNSTHAL HAD HIS WAY AND PERSUADED STRAUSS TO GO FOR A ROMANTIC COMEDY 
A WORK THAT AS WE SAID EARLIER STRAUSS DESCRIBED AS MORE IN THE STYLE OF FIGARO 
IT'S GOOD NIGHT FROM ALL OF US HERE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL
