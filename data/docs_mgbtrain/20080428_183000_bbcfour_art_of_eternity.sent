THE VERY FIRST ART HISTORIAN 
GIORGIO VASARI GAVE THE ART OF THE BYZANTINE EAST A LOUSY PRESS 
IT WAS CRUDE UNSOPHISTICATED 
PRIMITIVE AND I SOMETIMES WONDER 
ALTHOUGH HE WROTE FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
I WONDER IF WE HAVEN'T TAKEN HIM TOO MUCH AT HIS WORD 
I'VE NEVER SEEN A T. V. PROGRAMME ABOUT THE ART OF THE BYZANTIUM 
THE SUBJECT IS ABBREVIATED TO A FEW SIMPLIFICATIONS 
IN MOST HISTORIES OF WORLD ART 
AND YET THE ART THAT WAS PRODUCED IN THE EAST 
WAS AMONGST THE MOST VIBRANT COLOURFUL AND ENERGETIC 
THAT THE WORLD'S EVER SEEN 
I WANT TO EXPLORE THAT TRADITION 
TO TELL ITS STORY AND IT'S A STORY THAT BEGINS HERE 
IN A CITY CALLED ISTANBUL 
THAT WAS ONCE CALLED CONSTANTINOPLE 
THIS MODERN CHAOTIC PORT CITY 
WAS ONCE THE CENTRE OF A DYNASTY 
SO POWERFUL IT SEEMED IMMUNE TO CHANGE AND DECAY 
BUT NOTHING LASTS FOREVER 
AND THE STORY OF HOW A ONCE GREAT CHRISTIAN EMPIRE GREW AND SPREAD 
HOW IT REACHED ITS ZENITH FADED AND DIED 
ALL THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE RADIANT 
SHAPE SHIFTING FORMS OF ITS ART 
IT WAS EMPEROR CONSTANTINE THE EARLIEST CHRISTIAN EMPEROR 
WHO FIRST CAME HERE IN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR AD 
WHEN THIS PLACE WAS KNOWN AS BYZANTIUM 
STRATEGICALLY SITUATED ON THE BANKS OF THE BOSPHORUS 
THE CITY STRADDLES EUROPE AND ASIA 
EMPEROR CONSTANTINE CHANGED ITS NAME TO CONSTANTINOPLE 
IN THIS MOSAIC OF THE SIXTH CENTURY 
HE'S SEEN OFFERING THE NEW CAPITAL TO GOD 
AND BY THE SAME TOKEN SEEKING GOD'S PROTECTION FOR HIS NEW EMPIRE 
IN THE EAST 
THE ONE THOUSAND YEAR PERIOD THAT FOLLOWED WOULD BE KNOWN AS THE BYZANTINE ERA 
WITH CONSTANTINOPLE ITS CENTRE OF POLITICAL AND CULTURAL THOUGHT 
AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING A WHOLE NEW ROMAN HEADQUARTERS 
CONSTANTINE BROUGHT WITH HIM THE NEW RELIGION KNOWN AS CHRISTIANITY 
THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND THE FOLK OF THE BYZANTINE WORLD 
WOULD CREATE SOME OUTSTANDING WORKS OF ART AND ARCHITECTURE 
BUILDINGS AND IMAGES DESIGNED TO CONVINCE THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED THEM 
THAT THE CHRISTIAN FAITH WAS THE ONE TRUE PATH TO SALVATION 
IT'S AN IRONY OF FATE 
AND HISTORY THAT MANY GREAT CHURCHES SUCH AS THE HAGIA SOPHIA 
WERE LATER TRANSFORMED INTO MOSQUES 
BUT THEIR ORIGINS ARE VERY DEFINITELY CHRISTIAN 
THERE'S NO GREATER MONUMENT TO THE MIGHT AND SPLENDOUR OF THE GLORIOUS BYZANTINE CIVILISATION 
THAN THIS GREAT CATHEDRAL HAGIA SOPHIA 
WALKING IN IS A SENSE STUNNING EXPERIENCE 
THIS GREAT DOME RAISED UP ABOVE YOU INTO THE VAULT OF HEAVEN 
ALMOST AS EXTRAORDINARY AS THE SHEER PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF THE PLACE 
IS THE FACT THAT IT WAS ALL BUILT IN JUST FIVE YEARS 
IN THE PAST THIS PLACE WAS THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS OF THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE 
AND THE CENTRE OF WHAT CAME TO BE KNOWN AS ORTHODOX CHRISTIANITY 
THIS BUILDING DATES FROM THE EARLY SIXTH CENTURY 
AND IS A TESTAMENT TO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FIGURES OF THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE 
EMPEROR JUSTINIAN I 
HIS RULE COINCIDED WITH WHAT MIGHT BE DESCRIBED 
AS THE GOLDEN AGE OF BYZANTIUM 
A TIME OF UNPARALLELED PEACE AND PROSPERITY 
WHICH MADE POSSIBLE THE VERY CREATION OF THE HAGIA SOPHIA 
THE ORIGINAL SCHEME WAS VERY SIMPLE ON THE EVIDENCE OF WHAT SURVIVED 
BASIC CROSSES AND ALMOST NOTHING FIGURATIVE 
WHETHER THIS WAS A PLANNED EFFECT OF SOBRIETY AND RESTRAINT 
OR MERELY A WAY OF GETTING THE BUILDING FINISHED ON TIME 
WE'LL NEVER KNOW 
WHAT IS CERTAIN 
IS THAT THE BUILDING OF THE HAGIA SOPHIA CHANGED THE COURSE OF WORLD ARCHITECTURE 
ITS MASSIVE DOME SEEMINGLY SUSPENDED IN MID AIR 
APPEARS TO DEFY GRAVITY 
HAVING NO OBVIOUS MEANS OF SUPPORT 
THE DOME OF THIS BUILDING 
IS THIRTY TWO METRES ACROSS 
WE DO OF COURSE HAVE THE DOME OF THE PANTHEON IN ROME 
WHICH IS LARGER BUT THIS IS A MUCH MORE DARING ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRUCTION 
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT WONDERING WHAT SOMEONE FROM ROME WOULD THINK COMING HERE 
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THE PANTHEON IN THEIR MIND 
WHAT I ASSUME WOULD HAVE STRUCK THEM 
IS YES THERE'S A DOME AS BIG AS THE PANTHEON'S DOME 
BUT IT'S BEEN SORT OF VERTICALLY PROPELLED 
AND IT'S SURROUNDED BY THIS OTHER HUGE ARCHITECTURAL FABRIC 
ABSOLUTELY AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE PANTHEON IN PARTICULAR 
THE DOME IS SUPPORTED ON A CONTINUOUS WALL 
ON A DRUM HERE WE'VE GOT SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT 
WHEN YOU GO INTO THE CHURCH IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE 
JUST HOW THE DOME IS SUPPORTED 
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS VEILED BEHIND COLONNADE 
SO THE MAIN PIERS DON'T STAND OUT 
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE INTERIOR 
THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING POINT 
DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT HAVE STRUCK YOUR ORDINARY BYZANTINE BLOKE 
AS A KIND OF FEAT OF DIVINE MIRACULOUS ENGINEERING 
AS VISIBLE TANGIBLE EVIDENCE THAT THIS GUY MUST HAVE GOD ON HIS SIDE 
OTHERWISE HOW COULD HE FLOAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I'M SURE YES I'M SURE IN BYZANTINE IMPERIAL PHILOSOPHY 
THE EMPEROR WAS GOD'S REPRESENTATIVE ON EARTH 
BY BUILDING A CATHEDRAL LIKE THIS ON SUCH A MASSIVE SCALE 
JUSTINIAN WAS MAKING THE POINT 
THAT HIS POWER WAS SUPPORTED 
BY GOD 
THE CHURCH OF THE HAGIA SOPHIA IS AN ARCHITECTURAL MARVEL 
THAT BECAME THE GREAT CHURCH OF THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE 
WHICH AT THE TIME OF EMPEROR JUSTINIAN I 
STRETCHED FROM MODERN DAY TURKEY IN THE EAST 
TO SPAIN IN THE WEST 
THE WORK CREATED IN CONSTANTINOPLE 
WAS THE ALPHA AND OMEGA OF BYZANTINE ART 
BUT TRAGICALLY MANY OF ITS VERY EARLIEST MASTERPIECES 
HAVE BEEN LOST 
FOR CENTURIES THE TRADITIONS FORGED IN CONSTANTINOPLE 
SHAPED EUROPEAN ART 
YOU CAN SEE THE EXTENT OF ITS IMPACT 
IN THE SATELLITE CITIES OF THE EMPIRE 
ONE OF THE KEY BYZANTINE CENTRES WAS THESSALONIKI 
IN MODERN DAY NORTHERN GREECE 
NESTLING BESIDE THE SEA IN A NATURAL HARBOUR 
IT WAS A CRUCIAL OUTPOST OF THE EMPIRE 
A THRIVING PORT TODAY 
AS IT WAS IN THE FIFTH AND SIXTH CENTURIES 
ITS PROSPERITY WAS BUILT ON MARITIME TRADE 
SUCH WAS ITS STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE 
EMPEROR CONSTANTINE ALMOST CHOSE IT 
AS HIS FIRST CITY OVER CONSTANTINOPLE 
HE WAS PROBABLY RIGHT NOT TO 
AS THIS WAS A CITY UNDER CONSTANT THREAT OF INVASION 
BUT IT'S THE FACT THAT IT WAS ALMOST UNDER PERMANENT SIEGE 
THAT LENDS THE ART THAT DEVELOPED HERE ITS PARTICULARLY INTENSE QUALITY 
THIS PART OF TOWN IS BUILT UP NOW A HONEYCOMB OF STREETS AND HOUSES 
BUT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THESE WERE FIELDS PERCHED ABOVE THE CITY 
AND STANDING ALONE AT THE SUMMIT OF THE HILL 
WAS A MONASTERY DEDICATED TO SAINT DAVID 
INSIDE IS THE CHURCH OF OSIOS DAVID 
WHICH CONTAINS A STUNNING SIXTH CENTURY MOSAIC 
IN NEAR PRISTINE CONDITION 
A FASCINATING GLIMPSE OF THE FORCES SHAPING CHRISTIAN ART 
IN THE EARLY BYZANTINE WORLD 
IT'S A WORK OF ART THAT SHOWS US VERY CLEARLY 
HOW STRONG THE GRECO ROMAN TRADITION THE HELLENISTIC 
TRADITION OF CULTURE AND ART WAS IN THIS CITY 
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE A BYZANTINE MOSAIC 
ONE THINKS OF BYZANTIUM AS HAVING LOTS OF GOLD AND GLITTER 
THE COLOURS ARE VERY LOW THESE BEAUTIFUL MUTED BLUES 
REDS AND GREENS AND THE MODELLING OF THE FIGURES IS VERY SCULPTURAL 
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT CENTRAL FIGURE OF CHRIST 
YOU CAN REALLY SENSE THE WAY IN WHICH THE ARTIST 
IS TAKING THE POWERS OF THE OLD GODS 
THE PAGAN GODS AND GIVING THEM TO THE NEW CHRISTIAN GOD 
THE SUBJECT'S TAKEN FROM THE BOOK OF REVELATION 
IT'S THE VISION OF EZEKIEL YOU CAN SEE EZEKIEL 
ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE THIS URGENT CROUCHING FIGURE 
WITH HIS HAND TO HIS EAR EXPERIENCING THIS GREAT VISION 
OF CHRIST AND WE SEE HIM SURROUNDED BY THE ATTRIBUTES OF HIS EVANGELISTS 
THERE'S MARK THE LION 
MATTHEW THE ANGEL 
JOHN THE EAGLE 
AND LUKE THE OX 
IT WAS ACTUALLY QUITE A NEW SUBJECT FOR AN ARTIST TO BE TAKING ON 
IN THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE IN THE SIXTH CENTURY BECAUSE 
THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS HAD ONLY RELATIVELY RECENTLY BEEN ACCEPTED INTO THE CANON OF CHRISTIAN TEXT 
BUT THE MESSAGE OF THE IMAGE WAS UNAMBIGUOUS 
THE END OF THE WORLD IS NIGH 
PRAY AND REPENT GET YOUR SPIRITUAL HOUSE IN ORDER 
OR YOU WON'T BE SAVED 
NOW THIS IMAGE ACQUIRED EVEN MORE POTENCY 
LATER IN THE CITY'S HISTORY 
BECAUSE BY THE NINTH CENTURY 
THIS MONASTERY WAS IN A RELATIVE STATE OF DISREPAIR 
AND THE IMAGE HAD LONG BEEN COVERED OVER AND FORGOTTEN ABOUT 
NOW THE STORY GOES THAT AN OLD MONK WAS IN HERE ONE DAY SHELTERING FROM A STORM 
WHEN SUDDENLY AN EARTHQUAKE STRUCK 
THERE WAS A SHATTERING NOISE BEHIND HIM 
ALL THE COVERING FELL AWAY 
AND THIS IMAGE SUDDENLY APPEARED 
THE MONK WAS SO DEVASTATED THAT HE ACTUALLY DIED ON THE SPOT 
AS A RESULT OF THIS ACT OF DIVINE INTERVENTION 
THIS PLACE BECAME A SITE OF PILGRIMAGE 
THOUSANDS WOULD COME HERE TO LOOK AT THIS IMAGE 
WHICH THEY BELIEVED HAD ACTUALLY BEEN CREATED BY GOD HIMSELF 
IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY MIGHT ALMOST TOUCH DIVINITY 
BY LOOKING AT IT 
THE CHARACTER WHO CAME TO DOMINATE THE IMAGINATION OF THESSALONIANS 
IN THE BYZANTINE ERA PERHAPS EVEN MORE THAN CHRIST HIMSELF 
WAS THEIR PATRON SAINT 
THE SPIRITUAL PROTECTOR SAINT DEMETRIOS 
AS CAN BE SEEN IN THE CHURCH DEDICATED TO HIM 
THE CHURCH DATES BACK TO THE FIFTH CENTURY 
AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS EXTENSIVELY RENOVATED FOLLOWING A FIRE IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN 
SOME OF THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH CENTURY MOSAICS THAT CAN STILL BE SEEN HERE 
ARE AMONG THE BEST SURVIVING EXAMPLES OF EARLY BYZANTINE ART 
WHAT'S MOST INTERESTING ABOUT THEM IS THE EMPHASIS 
THEY PLACE ON DEMETRIOS HIMSELF 
A WARRIOR SAINT WHOSE LIFE AND LEGENDS ARE ENSHROUDED IN MYTH 
BUT WHO CAME TO SEEM AS PRESENT AND ACTUAL AS A REAL FATHER OR BROTHER 
TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE 
IN BYZANTINE CULTURE THE EMPEROR HIMSELF 
WAS SO CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH JESUS 
BUT THE PEOPLE AT LARGE DIDN'T FEEL THEY HAD THE RIGHT TO APPROACH CHRIST DIRECTLY 
THEIR EMPEROR WAS THE ONLY MORTAL WITH A DIRECT HOTLINE TO GOD 
SO THEY HAD TO APPROACH A FIGURE RATHER LOWER DOWN 
THE DIVINE HIERARCHY 
AND IN THESSALONIKI 
THAT WAS SAINT DEMETRIOS 
THEY PRAYED TO HIM IN THE HOPE THAT HE'D PASS THE MESSAGE UPSTAIRS 
AND THEIR WISHES WOULD BE GRANTED 
A PATTERN OF BELIEF TOUCHINGLY REFLECTED IN THIS IMAGE 
OF HIM SHELTERING THE CHILDREN OF THE CITY 
THESE MOSAICS SHOW THE DEVOTION OF BYZANTINE COMMUNITIES 
TO THEIR CHOSEN SAINTS 
AND BECAUSE THESSALONIKI WAS SO REGULARLY BESIEGED 
THIS WAS A CITY THAT NEEDED A NEVER ENDING SUPPLY OF MIRACLES 
READING THROUGH ANNALS OF THE CITY IT SEEMS 
THAT SAINT DEMETRIOS WAS FOREVER SAVING THE PEOPLE OF THESSALONIKI FROM ONE DISASTER OR ANOTHER 
IN TIMES OF PLAGUE THEY'D PRAY TO HIM AND BE MIRACULOUSLY CURED 
OR IF THE CITY WAS BEING INVADED HE'D COME TO THERE AID 
ON ONE OCCASION THE SLAVS ATTACKED BY KNIGHTS 
AND SUDDENLY THIS CHURCH BURST INTO FLAMES WAKING UP ALL THE PEOPLE 
THEY PUT OUT THE FIRE REALISED THEY WERE BEING ATTACKED AND REPELLED THE INVADERS 
ONCE AGAIN SAINT DEMETRIOS HAD COME TO THEIR AID 
BUT MY FAVOURITE STORY CONCERNS A PARTICULARLY MISCHIEVOUS DEACON CALLED ONESIPHORUS 
WHO WAS IN THE HABIT OF SNEAKING INTO THE SACRISTY AT NIGHT 
AND STEALING THE CANDLES WHICH WERE WORTH A LOT OF MONEY IN THOSE DAYS 
THEN ONE NIGHT WHILE HE WAS ABOUT THIS DASTARDLY DEED 
THE VOICE OF SAINT DEMETRIOS BOOMED OUT 
ONESIPHORUS YOU'RE AT IT AGAIN 
THE MORAL OF THE STORY BEING 
AS EVER THAT SAINT DEMETRIOS HAS HIS EYE ON YOU 
AT ALL TIMES 
AND THIS IS WHERE SAINT DEMETRIOS LIES 
LOCAL PEOPLE COME EACH DAY TO WORSHIP IN THE SHRINE 
THAT IS SAID TO CONTAIN HIS BODY AND TO ASK FOR THEIR PRAYERS 
TO BE ANSWERED 
THESSALONIANS STILL LOOK TO SAINT DEMETRIOS 
FOR THEIR HEALTH PROTECTION AND SPIRITUAL WELL BEING 
EVEN TODAY A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF BOYS BORN IN THE CITY 
ARE CHRISTENED DEMETRIOS 
THESSALONIKI'S GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION 
MADE IS VULNERABLE TO ATTACKS BY LAND OR SEA 
BUT ANOTHER OF THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE'S GREAT CENTRES 
PROVED TO BE A MORE ROBUST STRONGHOLD 
HOWEVER EVEN HERE THE TENSIONS OF THE TIME 
ARE SUBTLY REFLECTED IN THE CHARACTER OF ITS ART 
FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS THE ITALIAN TOWN OF RAVENNA 
WAS THE CAPITAL OF THE WESTERN HALF OF THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE 
FROM THE YEAR FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE 
ONE OF THE GERMANIC TRIBES THE OSTROGOTHS CONTROLLED THE TOWN 
UNTIL JUSTINIAN I RECAPTURED IT FOR THE EMPIRE IN FIVE HUNDRED FORTY 
IN RAVENNA'S GREAT MONUMENTS 
WE CAN SENSE THE PENDULUMS SWINGS OF BYZANTINE ART AS A WHOLE 
AN ART BORN OUT OF STRUGGLE AND SUFFERING 
BUT ALSO CAPABLE OF UNPARALLELED MAGNIFICENCE 
SAN APOLLINARE NOUVO IS FAMOUS FOR ITS GREAT FRIEZE OF MOSAIC IMAGERY 
A GRAND PROCESSION OF CHRISTIAN MARTYRS BEARING PALMS 
THEY SEEM TO STEP IN SLOW MARCH AROUND THE WALLS OF THE CHURCH 
THE PROCESSION CULMINATES ON THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE CHURCH 
WITH THIS WONDERFULLY VIVID REPRESENTATION OF THE THREE MAGI 
THE WISE MEN FROM THE EAST 
FANTASTICALLY DRESSED AND OFFERING THEIR GIFTS 
TO THE INFANT CHRIST 
JUST AS THE MARTYRS WHO ACCOMPANY THEM HAVE OFFERED TO GOD 
THE GIFT OF THEIR LIVES 
FOR ALL THE SPLENDOUR OF THE DECORATION 
YOU CAN FEEL THAT WHAT LIES BEHIND IT 
IS A VERY STRONG SENSE OF THE HUMAN COST 
OF DEFENDING AND SUSTAINING CHRISTIANITY 
A FAITH THAT'S IMPLIED HERE STEEPED IN THE BLOOD OF ITS MARTYRS 
ENCIRCLED BY ENEMIES ON ALL SIDES 
I LOVE THE STARK SIMPLICITY OF THE BASILICA CHURCH 
IT'S ALMOST JUST A LIGHT BOX FOR THE SHIMMERING MESSAGE 
OF THE MOSAICS 
SAN APOLLINARE NOUVO 
IS ONE OF NO FEWER THAN EIGHT WORLD HERITAGE SITES IN RAVENNA 
MOST MAGNIFICENT OF ALL IS THE CHURCH OF SAN VITALE 
ITS GREATEST TREASURE BEING THE CYCLE OF MOSAICS IN THE APSE OF ITS CHURCH 
HERE WE'LL SEE NOT A CHRISTIAN ART OF SUPPLICATION AS AT THESSALONIKI 
NOR A CHRISTIAN ART OF MARTYRDOM AS AT SAN APOLLINARE 
INSTEAD WE'LL SEE A RESOUNDINGLY CONFIDENT ASSERTION OF IMPERIAL MIGHT 
CONFIDENT THAT GOD IS ON ITS SIDE 
IT'S A GREAT MOSAIC DECORATION WHICH SHOWS US JUSTINIAN HIMSELF 
SURROUNDED BY HIS RETINUE AND OPPOSITE HIM 
HIS EMPRESS WITH HER LADIES OF THE COURT 
ABOVE THEM CHRIST IS SEATED ON A GREAT GLOBE 
NOW ALL OF THIS WAS CREATED NEARLY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
BY A TEAM OF ARTISTS FROM THE EAST 
AND IT TOOK THEM TWENTY YEARS TO COMPLETE 
FOR MY MONEY IT REPRESENTS THE ABSOLUTE HIGH WATERMARK 
OF CHRISTIAN ART IN THE EARLY BYZANTINE PERIOD 
BUT TO REALLY APPRECIATE HOW EXTRAORDINARY IT IS 
YOU NEED TO GET UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL 
YOU ENTER THE SPACE THROUGH AN ARCH CONTAINING THE IMAGE OF CHRIST AND HIS DISCIPLES 
AND HERE IN THE PRESBYTERY WE HAVE A SERIES OF BIBLICAL SCENES 
THAT ESTABLISH THE TWO THEMES OF THIS GREAT CHAPEL 
WHICH ARE THE THEME OF MAKING AN OFFERING 
AND THE THEME OF RECEIVING DIVINE WISDOM FROM GOD HIMSELF 
HERE WE HAVE ABEL AND MELCHISEDEC MAKING A SACRIFICE 
ON THE OTHER SIDE IT'S THE STORY OF ABRAHAM AND ISAAC 
BOTH STORIES INVOLVE MAKING AN OFFERING WHICH AFTER ALL 
THIS WHOLE CHURCH IS THAT'S WHAT IT DOES 
IT MAKES AN OFFERING TO GOD 
NOW YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE A KIND OF INVISIBLE MEMBRANE 
SEPARATING THE PRESBYTERY FROM THE APSE 
BECAUSE SUDDENLY IF YOU MOVE FROM THOSE SCENES 
TO THESE SCENES WHICH CONTAIN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN 
PARADISE ITSELF 
WITH DEPICTIONS OF THE EMPRESS HERE AND THE EMPEROR HERE 
YOU ARE ACTUALLY MOVING I'M STEPPING LITERALLY FROM THE REALM OF THE WORLD 
OF THE MUNDANE OF THE FINITE 
INTO A SPACE THAT REPRESENTS THE INFINITE 
AND ALL THE MATERIALS IN THIS PART OF THE MOSAIC DECORATION 
ARE SUDDENLY DIFFERENT MUCH MORE GOLD MOTHER OF PEARL 
SILVER THESE EXTRAORDINARY REPRESENTATIONS OF THE EMPEROR 
SEEN WITH HIS GREAT GENERAL BELISARIUS 
WHO WOULD RE CONQUER THE EMPIRE UNDER HIS COMMAND 
HE'S FACING THE EMPRESS THEODORA 
WHAT'S FASCINATING ABOUT HER IS THAT SHE HAS SEWN INTO HER CLOAK 
AN IMAGE OF THE THREE MAGI THE THREE WISE MEN 
PROCESSING TOWARDS CHRIST 
WHAT'S THAT'S EXPRESSING IS THE IDEA THAT THESE COURTIERS 
THE ELITE OF THE BYZANTINE WORLD 
THEY ARE ANOTHER SET OF MAGI PROCESSING TOWARDS GOD 
THEY ARE IN DIRECT TOUCH WITH DIVINITY 
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE THEIR REPRESENTATIONS IN THIS SPACE 
QUITE APART FROM ANYTHING ELSE THESE TWO PANELS ON EITHER SIDE 
ARE REALLY THE ONLY SURVIVING PORTRAITS AND THEY ARE PORTRAITS 
THAT WE HAVE OF THE BYZANTINE IMPERIAL COURT IN THE TIME OF JUSTINIAN 
WHAT'S WONDERFUL ABOUT THIS IS THE SHEER ACTUALITY OF IT 
IT'S A BYZANTINE SIXTH CENTURY FASHION PARADE 
THEY'RE DRESSED UP TO THE NINES 
THEY'VE GOT THE BYZANTINE EQUIVALENT OF BLING IN THE FORM OF BRACELETS 
THAT LOOK ALMOST LIKE GOLD ROLEX WATCHES 
AND YET THERE'S ALSO A TREMENDOUS SOLEMNITY 
BECAUSE THESE ARE IMAGES OF THE EMPEROR AND THE EMPRESS TRANSFIGURED 
WHAT THESE IMAGES PREDICT IS THEIR FUTURE 
THEY WILL BE ABSORBED INTO PARADISE INTO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN 
THEY WILL SIT IN MAJESTY WITH THE GREATEST EMPEROR OF THEM ALL CHRIST 
IN THESE EXTRAORDINARY COLOURS THESE COLOURS LIKE FIRE 
WE HAVE A GREAT OFFERING 
A GREAT KIND OF FIRE OF COLOUR AND IMAGES 
PERPETUALLY BURNING TO THE GLORY OF GOD 
AND IT CONTINUES BURNING TO THIS DAY 
BRINGING GOOD FORTUNE ONTO THE PEOPLE OF RAVENNA 
AND BY EXTENSION THE PEOPLE OF THE WHOLE EASTERN EMPIRE 
BUT WHO STILL CAN'T FULLY EXPLAIN THEIR MAGIC 
THE CENTURIES AFTER JUSTINIAN AND THEODORA'S GOLDEN AGE 
WERE MARKED BY WAR AND INTERNAL STRIFE 
IN SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY ONE RAVENNA WAS SEIZED BY LOMBARD INVADERS FROM NORTHERN ITALY 
THIS COINCIDED WITH A HUGE THEOLOGICAL SPLIT 
OVER THE PRODUCTION OF RELIGIOUS IMAGES 
KNOWN IN THE CHURCH AS THE ICONOCLAST CONTROVERSY 
THOSE WHO BELIEVED IT WAS RIGHT TO DEPICT GOD JESUS AND THE SAINTS 
CLASHED WITH THOSE WHO CONSIDERED IT HERESY 
THESE ICONOCLASTS CONSIDERED THE SECOND COMMANDMENT 
THOU SHALT NOT BOW DOWN AND WORSHIP ANY GRAVEN IMAGE 
TO BE SACROSANCT 
THE STRUGGLE WAS VIOLENT AND DESTRUCTIVE 
ALL OVER THE EMPIRE PRECIOUS WORKS OF ART WERE OBLITERATED 
THE CONTROVERSY LASTED FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS 
UNTIL IT WAS FINALLY RESOLVED IN EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY THREE 
WHEN THE EMPIRE AUTHORISED THE USE AND PRODUCTION 
OF ICONS ONCE AND FOR ALL 
THE DECISION TO ALLOW RELIGIOUS ART 
IS COMMEMORATED IN A SPECIAL SERVICE IN THE ORTHODOX CHURCH 
ON THE FIRST SUNDAY IN LENT 
HAVING WON THE BATTLE THE SUPPORTERS OF ICONS IN THE CHRISTIAN EAST 
EMBRACED ART 
ICONS WERE PLACED AT THE VERY CENTRE OF ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN WORSHIP 
AND EVERYWHERE CHURCHES DECKED THEMSELVES WITH EVER MORE CONSPICUOUS DISPLAYS 
OF RELIGIOUS IMAGERY 
THE VICTORY OF THE ICONS ALLOWED PAINTING AND MOSAIC 
TO FLOURISH ONCE AGAIN 
OFTEN AT THE MOST REMOTE EDGES OF THE EMPIRE 
SOME OF THE BEST SURVIVING EXAMPLES OF THIS NEW WAVE OF BYZANTINE ART 
CAN BE FOUND IN THE MONASTERIES OF GREECE 
MONASTIC LIFE WAS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE BYZANTINE WORLD 
THE MONKS ENJOYED THE PATRONAGE OF WEALTHY CHRISTIANS 
AND USED THE MONEY TO CREATE RICH WORKS OF ART 
DEDICATED TO THE GLORY OF GOD 
CLINGING TO THE STEEP SLOPES OF MOUNT HELIKON IN THE SOUTHWESTERN CORNER OF GREECE 
OF HOSIOS LOUKAS 
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BYZANTINE MONUMENTS 
BUILT IN THE YEARS AFTER THE DEFEAT OF THE ICONOCLASTS 
IN THE BYZANTINE SCHEME OF THINGS 
WHILE THE EMPEROR WAS CHRIST'S 
REPRESENTATIVE ON EARTH 
THE MONKS WERE EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY LIVED THE LIFE OF CHRIST ON EARTH 
IT WAS THEIR JOB THROUGH THEIR PRAYERS THEIR ACTS AND THEIR WORKS 
TO CREATE A KIND OF SPIRITUAL LADDER 
BY WHICH ALL MIGHT ASCEND TO SALVATION 
IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT THAT COULD MEAN IN PRACTICE 
THIS IS THE PLACE TO COME 
THE CHURCH OF HOSIOS LOUKAS IS A COMPRESSION CHAMBER 
OF SPIRITUAL ASPIRATION 
IT'S A GRAND SPACE 
BUT THE EYE IS ALWAYS DRAWN UPWARDS 
TO A MULTITUDE OF SCENES CREATED IN THE GLITTERING TESSERA 
OF THE MOSAIC MAKERS' ART 
I THINK WHAT'S REALLY STRIKING ABOUT THE STYLE OF THESE MOSAICS 
IS THEIR AUSTERITY AND SOLEMNITY 
BUT WHAT'S ALSO FASCINATING ABOUT THE FACES OF THESE PROPHETS 
AND SAINTS AND ANGELS 
IS THAT ALL THE FIGURES HAVE THESE WIDE STARING EYES 
AS IF THEY ARE LITERALLY MORE OPEN THAN THE REST OF US 
TO THE LIGHT OF GOD 
TO ME IT SUGGESTS THE IDEA ALMOST OF ECSTASY 
THAT STATE OF SPIRITUAL CONTEMPLATION 
WHERE YOU LITERALLY FEEL AS IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE YOUR BODY 
THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO CREATED THESE TENTH AND ELEVENTH CENTURY IMAGES 
ARE LOST IN THE PAST 
SADLY BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS OF BRILLIANTLY FRESH TOUCHES OF INVENTION HERE 
LOOK AT THE WAY CHRIST'S BAPTISM HAS BEEN DEPICTED 
HOW THE WATER'S BEEN RENDERED AS A SERIES OF CIRCULAR RIVULETS 
THAT RIPPLE AND COIL AROUND THE BODY OF CHRIST 
FOR THE THOUSAND YEARS FOLLOWING THEIR CREATION 
THE MOSAICS OF HOSIOS LOUKAS HAVE BEEN CARED FOR AND REVERED BY GENERATION 
AFTER GENERATION OF MONKS 
YET IN THE WEST THERE'S BEEN A DEEP SEATED PREJUDICE 
EVEN CONTEMPT FOR THIS ART 
STARTING WITH GIORGIO VASARI BUT BY NO MEANS STOPPING WITH HIM 
THE FRENCH ENLIGHTENMENT WRITER VOLTAIRE SUMMED UP THE WHOLE HISTORY 
OF BYZANTINE CIVILISATION 
IN TWO SENTENCES 
THIS WORTHLESS HISTORY IS FULL OF NOTHING BUT DECLAMATIONS 
AND MIRACLES IT IS A DISGRACE TO THE HUMAN MIND 
BUT IF HE COULD HAVE COME HERE 
HE MIGHT JUST HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND 
THIS MONASTERY IS ON TOP OF A MOUNTAIN 
AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE FANTASTIC MOSAICS WE REALLY ARE SEEING 
THE SUMMIT OF THE BYZANTINE ART OF MOSAIC I THINK 
THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
THE FIGURES ARE CREATED IN THIS VERY AUSTERE STYLE 
AUSTERE SEVERE 
GEOMETRICAL 
RETICENT 
AND YET THEY'RE FULL OF THESE SORT OF FLASHES OF PASSION 
AND ENGAGEMENT 
WITH THE EMOTIONAL REALITY OF THE STORY 
THERE'S CHRIST WASHING THE FEET OF HIS DISCIPLES AND IN THE FIGURES OF THOSE DISCIPLES 
WHICH ARE WONDERFULLY ACTUAL AND VIVID THEY HAVE THE SAME FACES YOU MIGHT SEE OF PEOPLE IN THE STREET 
IN ATHENS TODAY YOU CAN SEE 
THEIR MIXTURE OF HUMILITY AND ALMOST SHAME THAT HE SHOULD BE DOING THIS FOR THEM 
I THINK THIS CRUCIFIXION SCENE IS ALSO 
EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE AND VERY MOVING 
DESPITE THE VERY SEVERE UPRIGHT GEOMETRICAL CHARACTER OF THE FIGURES 
IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE ALMOST MORE MOVING THAN MUCH LATER CRUCIFIXIONS IN WESTERN ART 
WHERE MARY AND JOHN ARE TWISTED INTO AN AGONY 
OF SORROW 
BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO BE SORT OF HOLDING THEIR EMOTIONS BACK 
THOSE EMOTIONS SEEM ALL THE STRONGER 
THAT FIGURE OF THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST IS EXTRAORDINARY THAT BENT BODY 
AND BLOOD POURING FROM HANDS AND FEET I THINK THIS IMAGE 
OF SAINT PETER 
SAINT PETER THE ROCK ON WHICH CHRIST BUILT HIS CHURCH 
IS SUMMED UP BY THIS GREAT 
CHRIST PANTOCRATOR OVER THE DOOR 
AND UNLIKE A LOT OF OTHER CHRISTS 
WHO VERY MUCH GIVE YOU THE FEELING THAT BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU 
THIS FIGURE SEEMS VERY BENIGN 
AND WITH BRILLIANT INGENUITY THE ARTIST 
HAS SHAPED CHRIST'S BODY 
OVER THE DOOR AS IF TO SUGGEST THAT HIS BODY WOULD CONTINUE DOWN 
AND BE THE DOOR SO THAT YOU ENTER 
YOU ENTER THIS SACRED SPACE 
THROUGH CHRIST'S BODY 
AS YOU FIND YOUR SALVATION THROUGH HIS WORSHIP I THINK IT'S JUST A BEAUTIFUL IDEA 
ONE ENDURING ENIGMA OF BYZANTINE ART 
IS ITS APPARENT LACK OF SPATIAL DEPTH 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE 
THAT THE ARTISTS WHO CREATED SUCH POWERFUL AND COMPLEX IMAGERY 
DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING 
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR USE OF SPACE THAT I WAS FINDING IT HARD TO PUT MY FINGER ON 
TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBTLETIES OF BYZANTINE ARTISTIC TECHNIQUE 
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO TALK TO A MODERN DAY LIVING AND BREATHING PAINTER OF ICONS 
THERE ARE OVER TWO THOUSAND ICONOGRAPHERS AS THEY'RE CALLED IN GREECE 
MANY LIVING AND WORKING IN THE MONASTERIES 
BUT BY FAR THE MAJORITY ARE HERE IN ATHENS 
AND OVER EIGHTY PER CENT OF THEIR WORK IS FOR THE GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH 
GIORGOS KORDIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN ICON PAINTING 
HE'S BEEN WORKING WITH THESE IMAGES FOR TWENTY YEARS 
AND RECENTLY ACCEPTED THE COMMISSION TO PAINT AN ENTIRE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN BEIRUT 
WITH FRESCOS' 
IS IT IMPORTANT I MEAN I ASSUME IT'S IMPORTANT YOU ARE A BELIEVER 
THAT YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN YES TO MAKE THIS ART 
YES I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT 
PRETTY BASIC REQUIREMENT YES OF COURSE 
O. K. OTHERWISE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT 
TO PAINT THINGS THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN 
ARE THERE DAYS 
IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU 
AS IT WERE JUST FEEL LIKE YOU JUST DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT SPIRITUAL ENERGY 
TO MAKE AN ICON SO YOU DON'T PAINT UM 
YES SOMETIMES 
I CAN'T PAINT SO I DON'T DO IT 
I TOLD GIORGOS THAT ON MY JOURNEYS SO FAR 
I'D MET PEOPLE WHO'D DESCRIBED THE IMAGES PORTRAYED IN BYZANTINE ART 
AS HAVING A MYSTICAL SENSE OF REALITY 
BOTH CETTI AND RAVENNA AND FATHER MANTZOURANIS 
IN HOSIOS LOUKAS REFER TO THE ICONS AS BEING ALIVE 
AN ICON 
IS LIVING WHEN IT HAS RHYTHM 
AND WHEN IT COMMUNICATES WITH THE SPECTATOR 
THROUGH RHYTHM 
COS THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
SO YOU USE THE WORD RHYTHM A LOT 
YEAH 
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO EXPLAIN IT TO ME 
I'M NOT SURE I QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY IT 
UM YEAH 
PROBABLY IT'S BETTER TO DRAW YOU SOMETHING 
IN ORDER TO SHOW YOU WHAT EXACTLY I MEAN 
THIS IS THE BYZANTINE ART PERSPECTIVE 
IF WE WANT TO DRAW A HOUSE 
WE HAVE TO DRAW IT IN THIS WAY 
YOU SEE MM HMM 
THE BACK SIDE GOES UP 
AND THE FRONT SIDE DOWN 
AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS HERE 
SEE 
BACK IT'S GOING UP 
AND THE OTHER GOES DOWN 
SO THIS FIGURE 
COMES TO US 
IT MOVES TOWARDS HERE 
THE PERSPECTIVE BRINGS THIS FIGURE TO US 
SO WE HAVE TWO DYNAMICS TWO DIFFERENT DYNAMICS 
AND IN THIS WAY 
WE CREATE RHYTHM 
YOU SEE RHYTHM IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO DYNAMICS 
SO IN A SENSE THE IMAGE IS 
DRAWING OUT A CONE EXACTLY INTO THE WORLD EXACTLY 
THE PICTORIAL SPACE IS IN FRONT OF THE ICON 
AND THE SPECTATOR ENTERS 
THE PICTORIAL SPACE 
AND THE SPECTATOR BECOMES PART OF THE ICON 
NOW THAT'S MASSIVELY DIFFERENT FROM THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE 
IT'S THE OPPOSITE TYPE OF PICTORIAL SPACE IT'S THE OPPOSITE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE 
SO IN THE RENAISSANCE THE PAINTING IS A WINDOW YES 
AND I WANT TO GO THROUGH THERE YES 
WHEREAS THE BYZANTINE 
AND WHAT SO TO SPEAK WHAT IS THE 
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION 
WHY BECAUSE IN BYZANTINE TRADITION 
WHICH IS VERY 
INFLUENCED BY ORTHODOX THEOLOGY 
KNOWLEDGE IS PARTICIPATION 
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW GOD 
YOU HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN GOD 
SO IF WE WANT TO KNOW THIS ICONIC REALITY 
WE HAVE TO HAVE A KIND OF PARTICIPATION 
IN THIS REALITY 
THAT'S WHY WHEN WE 
PAINT A CHURCH WE HAVE TO CREATE THIS KIND OF COMMUNION 
BETWEEN THE ICONS 
AND THE SPECTATORS 
LISTENING TO GIORGOS I REALLY DID FEEL THAT THE PENNY HAD FINALLY DROPPED 
IT'S NOT THAT THIS ART DOESN'T HAVE PERSPECTIVE 
BUT THAT IT USES PERSPECTIVE IN A DIFFERENT WAY 
I'D RESPONDED TO BYZANTINE ART INSTINCTIVELY 
BUT WHILE I'D BEEN WALKING AROUND AND LOOKING AT IT 
I HADN'T QUITE REALISED THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT HAD BEEN CHOREOGRAPHING MY MOVEMENT 
MAKING ME STAND IN A PARTICULAR SPACE 
WITHIN THE CONES SHAPED BY ITS LINES OF FORCE 
EMERGING FROM THE IMAGES 
I REALISED I HAD LITERALLY AS WELL AS EMOTIONALLY 
BEEN MOVED BY THIS ART 
NINETY EIGHT PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE OF GREECE ARE ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS 
THEY TAKE THE ART AND THE RELIGION THAT'S CENTRAL TO THEIR FAITH VERY SERIOUSLY 
MOST FAMILIES CREATE DEDICATED SHRINES 
FULL OF IMAGES THAT CAN ENCOMPASS PHOTOGRAPHS POSTCARDS 
EVEN OUTRIGHT KITSCH 
ICONIC ART'S PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIVED EXPERIENCE HERE 
FOR THE ORTHODOX CHURCH ICONS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE FAITH 
CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ICONS PAINTINGS MOSAICS TO THE ORTHODOX CHURCH 
WELL ONE THE MOST IMPORTANT QUALITIES OF AN ICON 
IS TO HELP YOU PRAY ALL RIGHT 
STYLE OF THE ICON 
WITH THE FACT THAT THE ICON IS A REPRESENTATION OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD 
TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE A BYZANTINE ICON IS FILLED WITH LIGHT 
THERE IS NO SINGLE SOURCE OF LIGHT THERE IS NO SHADOW 
IT'S THE LIGHT OF THE GRACE OF GOD 
ALL THIS AFFECTS THE SOUL OF THE VIEWER AND UM 
IT GIVES HIM SOMETHING OF THE PEACE THE JOY THE SERENITY AND THE CALMNESS 
THAT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF CHRISTIAN LIFE AND OF THE KINGDOM 
THE ICON IS NOT VENERATED IN AND FOR ITSELF 
THE ICON ALSO ALWAYS POINTS TOWARDS A CERTAIN PERSON 
AND THE PERSON'S VENERATED THROUGH THE ICON 
ICONS SUPPORT PRAYER AND OF COURSE 
PEOPLE HAVE SOME NEEDS AND THEY PRAY FOR THEM 
AND THEY SOMEHOW RELATE WITH THE SAINT THROUGH THE ICON 
WITHIN THE GREEK ORTHODOX FAITH ICONS CEMENT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN SAINTS AND THE PEOPLE 
IT'S A PROCESS THAT BEGINS VERY EARLY IN LIFE 
WHEN WE BAPTISE A CHILD WE GIVE HIM OR HER THE NAME OF A SAINT 
PARTLY IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS CHILD AND THE SAINT 
SO THE SAINT MAY ACT AS A KIND OF A ROLE MODEL 
TO INSPIRE THE BAPTISED PERSON TO FOLLOW IN HIS STEPS 
THE SAINT FOLLOWED IN THE STEPS OF JESUS CHRIST 
AND CHRISTIANS FEEL THAT THEY HAVE A CERTAIN CONNECTION WITH THE SAINT 
WHOSE NAME THEY BEAR AS WELL AS WITH MANY OTHER SAINTS 
GREECE STILL REMAINS A CHRISTIAN COUNTRY AND PEOPLE FEEL VERY MUCH 
ATTACHED TO THE SAINTS 
AND THE SAINTS FOR THEM ARE NOT FIGURES OF THE PAST 
THEY ARE LIVING REALITIES 
WHEN ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS GO IN WESTERN CHURCHES 
WHAT THEY SAY IS THAT THEY FIND THEM VERY COLD 
WHEREAS THEY FIND OUR OWN CHURCHES SPIRITUALLY WARM 
WITH ALL THE ICONS AROUND ALL THIS DECORATION ALL THIS REPRESENTATION 
OF THE VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD IT GIVES US STRENGTH TO KEEP GOING 
THE SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ICON WITHIN THE GREEK TRADITION 
CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE VERY ORIGINS OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH 
IT WAS EFFECTIVELY CREATED IN ONE THOUSAND FIFTY FOUR 
WHEN THE POPE IN ROME SENT THREE CARDINALS TO CONSTANTINOPLE 
WHERE THEY DELIVERED A DOCUMENT SEVERING ALL LINKS 
BETWEEN THE BYZANTINE EAST AND THE CHURCH OF ROME 
THIS BECAME KNOWN AS THE GREAT SCHISM 
IN TRUTH EAST AND WEST HAD BEEN BECOMING STRANGERS TO ONE ANOTHER FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME 
A KEY ISSUE WAS THE ROLE OF THE POPE 
WHOSE UNIVERSAL SUPREMACY THE BYZANTINES REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE GREAT SCHISM THE FORCES WOULD CLASH HEAD ON 
IN APRIL ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FOUR CRUSADERS EN ROUTE TO THE HOLY LAND 
DIVERTED TO CONSTANTINOPLE 
AFTER A THREE DAY RAMPAGE THEY TOOK CONTROL OF THE CITY 
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE BYZANTINES HAD YIELDED TO INVASION 
IT WAS AN EVENT OF SUCH MAGNITUDE 
THAT IT'S BEEN DRAWN AND PAINTED BY ARTISTS DOWN THE CENTURIES 
A CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNT DESCRIBES THE BLOOD CURDLING EVENTS 
IN THE STREETS IN THE TEMPLES 
WEEPING LAMENTATIONS THE GROANING OF MEN 
THE SHRIEKS OF WOMEN WOUNDS RAPE CAPTIVITY 
THE SACRED ALTAR FORMED OF ALL KINDS OF PRECIOUS MATERIALS 
AND ADMIRED BY THE WHOLE WORLD WAS BROKEN INTO BITS 
AND DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE SOLDIERS' 
WITH CONSTANTINOPLE NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE WEST 
THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE WAS DOOMED 
TO A SLOW LINGERING PROCESS OF DISINTEGRATION AND DECLINE 
BUT THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY WERE DETERMINED TO REGAIN CONTROL 
OF THEIR BELOVED CAPITAL 
AND RESTORE SOME OF THE EMPIRE'S EARLIER GREATNESS 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ONE AFTER MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY OF OCCUPATION 
BY WESTERN CHRISTIAN FORCES 
THE CITY WAS ONCE MORE RESTORED AS THE BYZANTINE CAPITAL 
IT WAS AN EVENT THAT WOULD HERALD THE BEGINNING 
OF A LAST GREAT ARTISTIC RESURGENCE 
AND ITS CENTRE WAS ONCE MORE THE HAGIA SOPHIA 
TO MARK THE RE TAKING OF THE CITY AND THE RECLAIMING OF THE CATHEDRAL 
A GREAT SERIES OF MOSAICS WAS COMMISSIONED FROM THE EMPIRE'S LEADING CRAFTSMEN 
AND IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A SENSE OF JUST HOW SOPHISTICATED 
BEAUTIFUL SUBTLE MOSAIC ART COULD BE IN CONSTANTINOPLE 
IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY 
THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE TO BE THAN HERE 
THIS MOSAIC IS CALLED THE DEESIS 
IT'S ONE OF THE TRUE MASTERPIECES OF BYZANTINE ART 
IT SHOWS THE FIGURES OF THE VIRGIN MARY AND SAINT JOHN THE BAPTIST 
PLEADING WITH CHRIST FOR THE SALVATION OF MAN 
IT'S TYPICAL OF THE FINAL FLOWERING OF BYZANTINE ART 
THAT FOLLOWED THE RESTORATION OF THE EMPIRE IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ONE 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS DEGREE OF SUBTLETY OF MODELLING 
CAN BE ACHIEVED IN MOSAIC 
THESE FACES LOOK FORWARD TO THE PINNACLE OF RENAISSANCE ART 
WHICH WAS INDEED HUGELY INFLUENCED 
BY THIS EARLIER BYZANTINE RENAISSANCE 
ALTHOUGH THE COMPOSITION OF THE IMAGE AND THE POSES OF THE FIGURES 
ARE REFLECTIONS OF MEDIEVAL BYZANTINE TRADITION 
ITS PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL REALISM IS QUITE NEW 
WITH HINDSIGHT IT'S EASY TO SEE ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN ART THAT SIMPLY AREN'T THERE 
BUT I WONDER IF THERE ISN'T SOME PORTENT OF THE END OF EMPIRE 
THE END THAT WAS TO COME IN THE SAD AND SOLEMN EYES OF THESE FIGURES 
AND THEY'RE JUST A FRACTION OF WHAT WAS ONCE HERE 
IN LOOKING AT THE MODERN FABRIC OF THE BUILDING 
OCCASIONALLY YOU COME ACROSS THESE LITTLE WINDOWS SO TO SPEAK 
THAT HAVE BEEN CUT INTO ITS MOSAIC PAST 
REVEALING THESE BEAUTIFUL FRAGMENTS 
IT LEAVES YOU WITH A STRANGE SENSE OF NOT JUST HOW MUCH HAS BEEN LOST 
BUT HOW MUCH MIGHT STILL LIE BENEATH 
BY FAR THE MOST COMPLETE EXAMPLE OF LATE BYZANTINE ART 
CAN BE SEEN IN ONE OF THE LAST BUILDINGS OF THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE 
THE CHORA MONASTERY 
IT ONCE STOOD ON THE VERY OUTSKIRTS OF CONSTANTINOPLE 
BUT TODAY IT'S BEEN SWALLOWED UP BY MODERN ISTANBUL 
THE CHURCH OF THE CHORA IS ONE OF THE REAL JEWELS OF CONSTANTINOPLE 
BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS ALMOST THE ONLY SURVIVING EXAMPLE 
THIS EXTRAORDINARY MOSAIC CYCLE 
WAS CREATED IN THE SECOND DECADE OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
AND IT SHOWS SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF THE VIRGIN AND THE LIFE OF JESUS 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STYLE OF THESE MOSAICS THEY'RE A WORLD AWAY 
FROM THE STATUESQUE SOLEMN MONUMENTALITY 
OF EARLIER BYZANTINE ART 
SUDDENLY THERE'S THIS TREMENDOUS EMPHASIS ON ACTION EMOTION 
FAR MORE FIGURES IN THE SCENES 
OVER THERE WE SEE THE RARELY DEPICTED MIRACLE OF THE WOMAN WITH THE ISSUE OF BLOOD 
AND SHE FLINGS HERSELF AT CHRIST'S FEET 
WITH THIS EXTRAORDINARY SORT OF ENERGY IN HER POSE 
WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN THIS BEFORE IN BYZANTINE MOSAICS 
OVER THERE THERE'S A VERY STRONG EMPHASIS HERE 
ON CHRIST AND HIS MIRACLES 
HE'S HEALING A BLIND MAN 
HEALING A DUMB MAN HEALING A LEPER 
THE EMPHASIS IS VERY STRONGLY ON SALVATION 
I WONDER IF THIS URGENCY THIS EMPHASIS ON SALVATION 
ISN'T PARTLY TO BE EXPLAINED BY THIS SCENE HERE 
BECAUSE IT INTRODUCES US TO THE MAN WHO PAID FOR ALL THIS 
HIS NAME WAS THEODORE METOCHITES 
AND HERE HE IS ON HIS KNEES OFFERING THIS SPLENDIDLY REMODELLED CHURCH 
TO JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF 
NOW THEODORE METOCHITES WAS A MAN WITH A DISTINCTLY DODGY REPUTATION 
SOME EVEN REFERRED TO HIM AS THE EMPEROR'S EVIL GENIUS 
AND HE WAS RENOWNED FOR FLEECING THE POOR TO LINE THE IMPERIAL COFFERS 
I WONDER IF PAYING FOR THIS SPLENDIDLY REMODELLED CHURCH 
WITH ITS MOSAICS WASN'T HIS WAY OF PUTTING SOME OF THAT MONEY BACK 
OF OFFERING IT TO GOD IN THE HOPE OF SAVING HIS OWN SOUL 
BUT THE CHORA'S MASTERPIECE IS IN THE INNER SANCTUM OF THE CHURCH 
THIS SPACE IS METOCHITES'S OWN FUNERARY CHAPEL 
AND HE HAD IT DECORATED INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH 
IN THE MUCH POORER MEDIUM OF PAINTING 
WE DON'T KNOW WHY THAT WAS SO 
COULD IT BE THAT HE DELIBERATELY CHOSE IT AS AN ACT OF HUMILITY 
OR DID HE SIMPLY RUN OUT OF MONEY 
ONCE AGAIN WE SEE SCENES FROM THE BIBLE 
FIGURES OF SAINTS PROPHETS AND ANGELS ALL IN PAINT 
BUT THIS TIME THERE'S MUCH LESS TO DETAIN THE EYE IN THESE SCENES 
ALL THE EMPHASIS IS TOWARDS THIS END 
AND TOWARDS THIS EXTRAORDINARY IMAGE OF THE ANASTASIS 
THE HARROWING OF HELL 
IT'S FULL OF AN ENERGY THAT WE'VE REALLY NEVER SEEN IN BYZANTINE ART BEFORE 
LOOK AT THAT CENTRAL FIGURE OF CHRIST 
WHEREAS BEFORE DRAPERY MIGHT SEEM ALMOST LIKE A FORM OF ABSTRACT GEOMETRY 
HERE YOU REALLY FEEL THAT THERE'S A BODY INSIDE THAT DRAPERY 
PULLING ITS FOLDS APART 
AS CHRIST WITH GREAT PHYSICAL URGENCY 
PULLS ADAM AND EVE THE FOREBEARS OF ALL MANKIND 
FROM THEIR TOMBS 
IT'S THE RESURRECTION HE'S PULLING THEM INTO ETERNITY 
PULLING THEM INTO SALVATION 
AND SALVATION IS WHAT THIS SPACE IS ALL ABOUT BECAUSE SALVATION IS WHAT METOCHITES DREAMED OF 
WHAT I REALLY LOVE IN THIS PICTURE AS WELL 
IS THIS FANTASTIC DETAIL 
THAT CHRIST IS HARROWING HELL 
WHAT HE'S DONE IS HE'S BROKEN THE GATES OF HELL 
AND YOU CAN SEE ALL THIS BRIC A BRAC THIS DEBRIS 
THIS LOCKSMITHERY THOSE ARE ALL THE LOCKS THAT WERE USED TO FASTEN HELL 
IT'S QUITE HARD TO MAKE OUT 
BUT IT'S THE FIGURE OF SATAN TRAMPLED BENEATH CHRIST'S FEET 
IT'S A PROFOUNDLY POWERFUL ENERGETIC IMAGE 
OF SALVATION 
AND I THINK IT'S NOT HARD TO IMAGINE METOCHITES CONTEMPLATING IT 
VERY MUCH WITH HIS OWN SALVATION IN MIND 
ANOTHER THING THAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS SPACE AND THIS STORY 
IS THAT METOCHITES'S LIFE DID NOT END UP BEING ENTIRELY A BED OF ROSES 
IN THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTIES HE WAS OUSTED FROM THE IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD DURING A PALACE COUP 
HE LOST ALL HIS MONEY ALL HIS POWER ALL HIS PRIVILEGES 
AND HE ENDED UP DYING HERE AS A MONK 
A SIMPLE MONK IN THE MONASTERY CHURCH THAT HE'D SO RICHLY ENDOWED 
AND I DON'T THINK PERHAPS THAT BY THE TIME HE DID REACH HIS END 
HE CARED TOO MUCH ABOUT THE LOSS OF ALL HIS POWER AND PRIVILEGES 
BECAUSE HIS MIND WAS NOT ON THE HERE AND NOW IT WAS ON ETERNITY 
ON THE IMAGE EMBODIED IN THAT EXTRAORDINARY PICTURE 
NOW THIS IS ACTUALLY THE LAST GREAT WORK OF BYZANTINE ART 
IN CONSTANTINOPLE 
SO IT'S NOT JUST ONE MAN'S LAST MEMORIAL LAST MONUMENT 
IT'S ALSO THE SWAN SONG OF AN ENTIRE EMPIRE 
THE WORKS OF THE CHORA 
WERE INDEED THE FINAL FLOURISH OF A DYING CIVILISATION 
THE MIGHTY CAPITAL OF CONSTANTINOPLE 
FINALLY FELL TO TURKISH INVADERS IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THREE 
CHRISTIAN ART AND ARCHITECTURE CONTINUED TO EXIST UNDER THE NEW OTTOMAN EMPIRE 
BUT OVER THE YEARS THE CHRISTIAN ARTISTIC LANDSCAPE 
GRADUALLY CHANGED INTO AN ISLAMIC ONE 
CATHEDRALS BECAME MOSQUES AND MINARETS ROSE INTO THE SKY 
MOSAICS WERE PLASTERED OVER OR WHITEWASHED 
WORKS OF ART THAT HAD SURVIVED SINCE THE TIME OF EMPEROR CONSTANTINE 
WERE GRADUALLY ERASED FROM THE NEW OTTOMAN CAPITAL 
AND YET THE BYZANTINE ART TRADITION 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN BATTLED BY CENTURIES OF TURMOIL 
RELIGIOUS CONFLICT IMPERIAL DECLINE 
BUT IT STILL SURVIVES IN A MULTITUDE OF POWERFULLY DIRECT IMAGES 
FORMS AND ABOVE ALL FACES 
SO INTENSELY ELOQUENT THEY STILL SEEM ON THE POINT OF SPEECH 
ONE LAST THOUGHT UNLIKE VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER SCHOOL OF CHRISTIAN ART 
THE ART THAT BEGAN IN THE BYZANTINE EAST HERE IN CONSTANTINOPLE 
IS STILL ALIVE AND THRIVING 
NOT BAD FOR A SUPPOSEDLY PRIMITIVE TRADITION 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET 
YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
