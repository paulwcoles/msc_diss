FOR TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE THE U. TURN 
THAT HAS JUST BECOME A TAX GIVEAWAY 
COSTING TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION THE TORIES 
SAY IT IS A CON 
ALSO TONIGHT PLUCKED FROM THE 
RUBBLE CHINESE TROOPS RESCUED 
DOZENS OF EARTHQUAKE SURVIVORS BUT 
THOUSANDS ARE STILL BURIED 
NEW PICTURES EMERGE OF THE MOMENT 
THE QUAKE STRUCK AS THE DEATH TOLL 
CLIMBS TO TWELVE THOUSAND 
THE ISLAMIST PLOT TO BLOW UP 
TRANSATLANTIC PLANES A COURT IS 
SHOWN WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED 
AND THE HIGH SPEED CAR CHASE THAT 
STARTED WITH A ROW OVER POCKET 
MONEY A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD IS CLOCKED AT 
OVER ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. 
ON B. B. C. LONDON THE MET POLICE 
STOPPED A MASSIVE INCREASE IN STOP 
AND SEARCH TO PREVENT KNIFE MURDERS 
AND THE B. A. PACKAGE BAN THAT MEANS A 
SLOW TRIP TO CHINA FOR VITAL 
OLYMPIC EQUIPMENT THE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE 
GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO THE B. B. C. 
NEWS TAX CUTS ARE USUALLY RESERVED 
FOR THE BUDGET BUT IN A SIGN OF 
JUST HOW EAGER ALASTAIR DARLING IS 
TO SORT OUT THE TEN P. TAX ROW HE HAS 
ANNOUNCED CHANGES NOW IN A SURPRISE 
PACKAGE COSTING TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION 
PEOPLE ON LOW AND MIDDLE INCOMES 
WILL GET AN EXTRA ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PER YEAR PER 
STOP THE TORIES ACCUSED THE 
CHANCELLOR OF A TAX IN TURN IN 
TIME FOR A TOUGH BY ELECTION LATER 
THIS MONTH 
IT STARTED AS A ROW OVER GETTING 
RID OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE NEELIE 
SPINNING THE LABOUR PARTY OUT OF 
CONTROL BUT IT HAS TURNED INTO A 
GAMBLE TO WIN BACK VOTERS NEARLY 
THE CHANCELLOR ANNOUNCING CHANGES 
TO INCOME TAX THAT WILL AFFECT TWENTY 
MILLION PEOPLE IT MATTERS NOWHERE 
MORE THAN IN CREWE WHERE THERE IS 
A BY ELECTION SOON 
AT THE COST OF 
TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION I WILL INCREASE THE 
INDIVIDUAL PERSONAL TAX ALLOWANCES 
BY SIX HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE FOR THIS FINANCIAL 
YEAR BENEFITING ALL TAXPAYERS 
UNDER SIXTY FIVE 
IN CREWE THERE WAS 
ANXIETY ABOUT SCRAPPING THE TEN P. TAX 
BAND WILL THAT MAKE THAT 
DISAPPEAR 
I THINK THEY TRY TO KID DISAPPEAR US ALL THE TIME ON FIGURES THEY 
SAY THEY ARE GIVING US ONE HUNDRED TWENTY BACK L. 
HAVE ALREADY LOST ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO 
ANYTHING TO 
HELP THE YOUNG AND THE POOR AND 
LOW INCOME ONES FINE BUT IT IS A 
SHAME IT HAD TO HAPPEN WHY DID 
IT HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE 
AROUND FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WERE TO 
LOSE OUT WOMEN OF CERTAIN AGE 
AND LOW EARNERS WITHOUT CHILDREN 
NEARLY ALL WILL BE COMPENSATED BUT 
MANY MORE MILLIONS WILL GAIN THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS RAISING PERSONAL 
TAX ALLOWANCES TO SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE WILL BENEFIT 
MORE THAN TWENTY TWO PEOPLE BUT IT WILL 
COST THEM DEAR THEY WILL HAVE TO 
BORROW TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION IT MAY BE 
SMALL CHANGE BUT ARGUMENTS OVER THE 
TEN P. TAX RATE HAVE LED THE 
GOVERNMENT TO MAKE AN ENORMOUS 
DECISION MINISTERS HAVE 
ESSENTIALLY WE WRITTEN THE BUDGET 
LABOUR MAY HOPE THIS WILL STOP ITS 
DOWNWARD SPIRAL BUT BY BORROWING 
BILLIONS BILLIONS IT IS AN 
EXPENSIVE RISK THE CONSERVATIVES 
SAID THE CHANCELLOR HAD BEEN 
HUMILIATED INTO THESE STEPS HE HE SERVES UP A COMPENSATION AFTER A 
TAX CON WHAT UTTER CYNICISM A 
COMPENSATION CON WHAT THE COMPUTER 
HUMILIATION 
BUT 
THE RINGLEADER OF HUMILIATION THE LABOUR RESULT REVOLT 
APOLOGISED AND EXPRESSED RELIEF 
MAY I CONGRATULATE THE CHANCELLOR 
FOR PUTTING AN END TO THIS ISSUE 
CAN I HAZARD GUESS THAT THE 
PLEASURE THAT IS BEING EXPRESSED ON 
THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE WILL BE 
WIDELY EXPRESSED IN THE COUNTRY AS 
WELL 
EVEN GRAFFITI ARTISTS HAVE WELL BEEN DEPICTING GORDON BROWN'S 
TROUBLES OF LATE BUT LABOUR HOPES 
TODAY'S COSTLY SURPRISE CAN BEGIN 
TO CHANGE THE POLITICAL PICTURE 
LET'S SEE WHAT NICK ROBINSON MAKES 
OF ALL THIS HE IS IN DOWNING 
STREET THIS REALLY DID GO MUCH 
FURTHER THAN ANYONE EXPECTED THIS THIS IS NOT A COMPENSATION PACKAGE FOR 
THE TEN P. TAX REBELLION IT IS AN 
EMERGENCY BUDGET DELIVERED JUST TEN 
WEEKS AFTER THE ORIGINAL ONE THE 
EMERGENCY IS NOT ECONOMIC OR 
FINANCIAL IT IS POLITICAL 
MINISTERS FEARED THEY WOULD BE 
DEFEATED BY ANGRY LABOUR M. P.'S ON 
THEIR BUDGET WHICH WOULD HAVE LED 
TO CALLS FOR THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
HEAD NOT TO MENTION A POSSIBLE BY 
ELECTION DEFEAT NEXT WEEK OR THE 
DISMORE FIGURES IN THE POLLS THAT 
IS WHY THIS PACKAGE GIVES NOT JUST 
MONEY TO THOSE WHO HAVE LOST BUT TO 
SEVENTY MILLION FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST 
NOTHING DISMORE FIGURES OF 
COURSE THERE ARE ECONOMIC 
ARGUMENTS FOR HELPING OUT PEOPLE AT 
A DIFFICULT TIME BUT THE 
CHANCELLOR HAS SIMPLY BORROWED TWO POINT EIGHT 
BILLION AND WRITTEN A CHEQUE TO TWENTY TWO 
MILLION FAMILIES WHEN I SPOKE TO 
THE CHANCELLOR IN THE LAST HOUR I 
PUT IT TO HIM THAT THIS REALLY WAS 
SOMETHING OF A HUMILIATING U. TURN 
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS THERE HAS 
BEEN A LOT OF THINKING ABOUT THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF THE REMOVAL OF THE 
TEN P. STARTING RATE OF TAX LAST YEAR 
GORDON BROWN WAS ABLE TO ANNOUNCE 
HELP THROUGH TAX CREDITS TAKING 
PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE OUT OF TAX BUT THAT 
WAS NOT ENOUGH THREE WEEKS AGO I 
WROTE TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND I 
TOLD THE HOUSE OF COMMONS I WOULD 
COME BACK TO THIS SAID IF I 
COULD FIND WAY BEFORE THE PRE 
BUDGET REPORT I WOULD DO SO YOUR YOUR CRITICS WILL SAY THIS IS A 
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED BRIDE TO THE 
ELECTORATE FROM A MAN WHO HAD A 
BUDGET JUST TEN WEEKS AGO BRIBE 
THE SAME PEOPLE WERE DEMANDING 
BEFORE THAT I COME UP WITH 
SOMETHING NOT IN NOVEMBER BUT NOW 
WE HEARD FROM FRANK FIELD IN THE 
REPORT BUT WILL THIS SATISFY ALL 
THE CRITICS 
ABSOLUTELY IT IS OVER 
SOME WILL WORRY ABOUT THE ELEVEN 
MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL LOSING 
ALTHOUGH THEIR LOSSES HAVE 
APPARENTLY BEEN MORE THAN HALVED 
BUT OVERALL LABOUR M. P.'S ARE 
DELIGHTED AND MANY PEOPLE WILL BE 
DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE A CHEQUE IN 
EFFECT FOR AROUND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SMILES ALL 
ROUND SMILES FROM WITHIN NUMBER TEN 
WHERE THEY BELIEVE THE DANGER IS 
OVER THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT 
CHANCELLORS WHO ARE FORCED TO 
REWRITE BUDGETS THREE WEEKS TEN 
WEEKS AFTER THE ORIGINAL ONCE 
STRUGGLED TO GET A GOOD REPUTATION 
ROBERT PESTON IS HERE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION 
CAN THE COUNTRY AFFORD IT 
AS WE 
HAVE HEARD THE CHANCELLOR IS 
BORROWING ALMOST THREE BILLION TO PAY 
FOR THIS A PRETTY WHACKING TAX CUT 
OF COURSE IN A NARROW TECHNICAL 
SENSE WE CAN AFFORD IT THAT 
COUNTRY IS NOT BANKRUPT THE PUBLIC 
FINANCES ARE IN BETTER SHAPE THAN 
IN THE NINETIES BUT THEY HAVE BEEN 
GETTING WORSE AND MANY ECONOMISTS 
BELIEVE THIS WILL CAUSE THE 
GOVERNMENT TO BREACH ITS OWN RULES 
ON HOW MUCH THE NATIONAL DEBT CAN 
EXPAND TO IN ITSELF THAT IS 
EMBARRASSING THERE I THINK IS 
WHERE THE REAL COST TO THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL COME IT IS A BLOW 
TO ITS CREDIBILITY HOW MANY TIMES 
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS HAVE WE 
HEARD GORDON BROWN TALKING ABOUT 
THE IMPORTANCE OF PRUDENCE AND 
STABILITY MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
THIS LOOKS LIKE A PANIC MEASURE 
JUST THE SORT OF THING HE HAS SET 
HIS STALL BY NEVER DOING THE OTHER 
THING TO BEAR IN MIND IS WHAT OTHER 
NON CONS THIS WILL HAVE L. HAD A 
REPORT HERE FROM A LEADING CITY 
ECONOMIST KNOCK ONS HE THINKS 
THIS WILL MAKE A CUT IN INTEREST 
RATES MUCH LESS LIKELY FOR THE 
PEOPLE GETTING THE BENEFIT FROM THE 
TAX CUT THERE WILL BE MILLIONS OF 
OTHERS THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WILL 
BE CONCERNED IF INTEREST AND 
MORTGAGE RATES DO NOT COME DOWN AS 
SOON AS THEY WOULD LIKE 
CHINESE RESCUERS ARE IN A RACE 
AGAINST TIME TO FIND EARTHQUAKE 
SURVIVORS ALL DAY SEARCH AND 
RESCUE TEAMS HAVE BEEN SIFTING 
THROUGH MOUNTAINS OF RUBBLE SO FAR 
THEY HAVE FOUND JUST FIFTY IT PEOPLE 
ALIVE BUT IT IS KNOWN THAT MORE 
THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE BURIED IN 
ONE TOWN ALONE THE PRIME MINISTER 
HAS SAID EVEN SECOND'S DELAY 
COULD COST CHILD'S LIFE THE 
QUICK DEVASTATED SICHUAN PROVINCE 
HOME TO NEARLY FORTY THREE MILLION CHINESE 
THE EPICENTRE WAS IN THE 
MOUNTAINOUS WENCHUAN COUNTY RESCUE 
TEAMS HAVE ONLY JUST MANAGED TO GET 
THERE TODAY THE OFFICIAL DEATH 
TOLL IS NOW TWELVE THOUSAND BUT THAT NUMBER 
IS EXPECTED TO SOAR ONE OF THE 
WORST HIT TOWNS IS DUJIANGYAN THE 
REPORT FROM THEIR CONTAINS SOME 
DISTRESSING IMAGES 
RESCUERS HAVE BEEN SEARCHING 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY FOR EARTHQUAKE 
SURVIVORS SOMETIMES THEIR 
PATIENCE PAID OFF THIS GIRL WAS 
PULLED ALIVE FROM THE RUBBLE IN THE 
CITY OF SHIFANG AT A HOSPITAL IN 
THE CITY OF DUJIANGYAN MORE THAN 
ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE FEARED TRAPPED WHEN 
PART OF IT FELL DOWN L. SORT 
FRIENDS AND RELATIVES GATHERED AT 
THE HOSPITAL INTEREST ENTRANCE 
FOUR NEWS BUT THE EXPRESSIONS ON 
THE 
BASIS OF 
THE WAITING HOSPITAL 
WORKERS TOLD THEIR OWN STORY ONLY 
ONE BODY WAS PULLED FROM THE 
HOSPITAL RUBBLE TODAY ACROSS THE 
CITY AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL ANXIOUS 
PARENTS ALSO WAITED FOR NEWS THE 
SCHOOL COLLAPSED DURING THE 
EARTHQUAKE TRAPPING HUNDREDS OF 
PUPILS INSIDE MANY DIED AS I WENT 
AROUND DUJIANGYAN THERE WAS 
GENUINE FEAR THAT AFTERSHOCKS COULD 
CAUSE MORE DAMAGE AND PEOPLE 
ABANDONED THEIR HOMES FEARING THEY 
COULD STILL COLLAPSE THESE PEOPLE 
AROUND ME ARE SPENDING THEIR SECOND 
NIGHT IN THE OPEN AIR IT IS 
RAINING THERE IS NO POWER THERE 
IS NO WATER AND THEY FEAR THEY ARE 
GOING TO BE AFTERSHOCKS OTHERS 
DECIDED IT WAS BETTER TO LEAVE THE 
CITY ALTOGETHER AND PACKED UP THEIR 
BELONGINGS SOLDIERS FROM THE 
CHINESE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY 
WERE LEADING THE RESCUE EFFORT 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY 
BEEN CONFIRMED DEAD AND THE 
AUTHORITIES FEAR THAT NUMBER WILL 
RISE AS RESCUERS REACHED MORE 
ISOLATED AREAS WEETCH DASHED 
REACH REACH THE RESCUE OPERATION IS ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST EVER FIFTY THOUSAND TROOPS HAVE 
BEEN MOBILISED ARRIVING BY TRAIN 
TRUCK PLAIN AND EVEN ON FOOT THEY 
HAVE BEEN HAMPERED TODAY BY 
APPALLING WEATHER AND BLOCKED ROADS 
THE MOMENT THE EARTHQUAKE STRUCK 
WAS RECORDED BY CAMERA TEAM AT 
CHENGDU AIRPORT MINUTES OF TERROR 
AND ANGUISH AS THE HUGE MODERN 
TERMINAL BUILDING SHOOK OFF ITS 
FOUNDATIONS ON ITS FOUNDATIONS 
PASSENGERS RUSHED OUT ONTO THE 
TARMAC BUT THE BUILDING SURVIVED 
CHENGDU SIXTY MILES FROM THE 
EPICENTRE ESCAPED THE WORST OF THE 
DAMAGE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING 
CHINA HAS GIVEN THIS DISASTER FOR 
COVERAGE WITH THE PRIME MINISTER 
WEN JIBAO PERSONALLY SUPERVISING 
RESCUE EFFORTS TO STOP IN THE PAST 
CHINESE LEADERS HAVE BEEN SLOW TO 
ALLOW PUBLICITY AND SLOW TO ACCEPT 
RESPONSIBILITY BUT THIS IS THE 
CHANGE OF APPROACH CHINA HAS 
MOBILISED FIFTEEN FIFTY THOUSAND TROOPS WITH 
THE OLYMPICS APPROACHING CHINA HAS 
MODERNISED ITS APPROACH TO 
PUBLICITY AND THE COUNTRY WILL KNOW 
HOW EFFECTIVE ITS LEADERS ARE SO 
FAR INFORMATION IS COMING FROM THE 
DENSELY POPULATED AREAS ON THE 
PLANE EAST OF WHERE THE ARE 
BLOCKED BY LAND THE PRIME MINISTER 
HAS ORDERED THE ARMY TO OPEN ROUTES 
BY THE END OF THE DAY BUT WITH 
BRIDGES DAMAGED OR DESTROYED SO 
FAR THE RESCUERS HAVE HAD TO MARCH 
IN AND THE REFUGEES TO WALK OUT 
THE FIRST GLIMPSES FROM THE 
MOUNTAINS SHOWED SCENES OF TERRIBLE 
DEVASTATION BUILDING AFTER 
BUILDING HAS COLLAPSED AND THESE 
ARE JUST THE FRINGES OF THE 
MOUNTAINS THERE IS LITTLE 
INFORMATION AS YET FROM THE TOWNS 
NEAR THE EPICENTRE THE FAMOUS 
PANDA RESERVE AT WULONG IS NEARBY 
THE PANDAS ARE SAID TO BE SAFE BUT 
SEVERAL PARTIES OF TOURISTS FROM 
BRITAIN AND THE U. S. HAD NOT BEEN 
HEARD FROM CHINA HAS HUGE TASK 
CHECKING FOR POSSIBLE SURVIVORS AND 
IT IS BEEN MADE HARDER BY WORSENING 
WEATHER SO FAR THE AUTHORITIES 
ARE DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THOSE 
THEY KNOW ARE DEAD AND THOSE THEY 
CANNOT FIND BUT AT SOME POINT THE 
OFFICIAL DEATH TOLL IS LIKELY TO 
RISE SUBSTANTIALLY 
YOU CAN STAY UP TO DATE WITH THE 
LATEST DETAILS ON THE SITUATION IN 
CHINA BY GOING TO THE WEBSITE 
THE JURY IN THE TRIAL OF EIGHT MEN 
ACCUSED OF PLOTTING TO BLOW UP 
TRANSATLANTIC PLANES HAS BEEN SHOWN 
PROSECUTION VIDEO OF LIQUID BOMB 
GOING OFF EXPLOSIVES EXPERTS 
STAGED AN EXPLOSION USING THE SAME 
INGREDIENTS THE DEFENDANTS 
ALLEGEDLY PLANNED TO USE THEY ALL 
DENY THE CHARGES 
IN BOMB PROOF ROOM AT THE 
FORENSIC EXPLOSIVES LABORATORY THE 
REASON WHY LIQUIDS 
ON RESTRICTED ON AIRCRAFT THIS SOFT DRINKS BOTTLE IS ABOUT TO DETONATE 
THE DOUBLE THICKNESS LAMINATED 
GLASS HAS SHATTERED REPEATED IN 
SLOW MOTION YOU CAN SEE THE MOMENT 
THE BOTTLE GOES OFF IT CONTAINS A 
MIXTURE OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE AND A 
SUGARY DRINK POWDER IT HAS BEEN 
DETONATED BY A HOME MADE HIGH 
EXPLOSIVE MADE FROM CITRIC ACID AND 
A CAMPING STOVE FUEL CALLED 
HEXAMINE THE PICTURES WERE SHOWN 
AT THE TRIAL OF EIGHT MEN ACCUSED 
OF PLANNING TO BLOW UP SEVEN OR 
MORE AIRCRAFT OVER THE ATLANTIC 
WITH LIQUID EXPLOSIVES 
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IN THIS CASE 
IS WHETHER IT IS INDEED POSSIBLE TO 
TAKE THIS DRINK POWDER AND MIX IT 
WITH HIGH STRENGTH HYDROGEN 
PEROXIDE AND PUT IT INTO A DRINKS 
BOTTLE LIKE THIS AND CREATE A 
LIQUID BOMB THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT 
GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS MANAGED TO DO 
POLICE HAD DISCOVERED THESE BOTTLES 
IN A LONDON FLAT THE LIQUID HAD 
BEEN CAREFULLY DRAINED OUT INWARDS 
IN HIGH WYCOMBE THEY FOUND HYDROGEN 
PEROXIDE IN MINERAL WATER BOTTLES 
AND THE SUITCASE CONTAINING 
CHEMICALS AND EQUIPMENT TO MAKE 
DETONATING EXPLOSIVE 
GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS ACKNOWLEDGE 
IT TOOK THEM MORE THAN THIRTY TESTS TO 
PRODUCE AN EXPLOSION AND THE EIGHT 
MEN ON TRIAL DENY CONSPIRACY TO 
MURDER MURDER OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT THE 
CHANCELLOR HAS ANNOUNCED 
COMPENSATION FOR OVER TWENTY MILLION 
PEOPLE IN THE ROW OVER THE TEN P. TAX 
RATE RATE COMING UP THE TEENAGER CLOCKED AT 
OVER ONE HUNDRED MILES PER AWAY IN ROW OVER POCKET MONEY 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON THE SHOREDITCH 
CAMPAIGNERS HAVE BEEN MEDIEVAL 
LAW CAN HELP THEM KEEP THE 
DEVELOPERS AT BAY HOPING WE 
LOOK AT THE RESTORATION OF SURREY 
HEATH AND DESTROYED BY FIRE 
HEATHLAND 
THE COST OF LIVING HAS GONE UP 
AGAIN THIS TIME THE BIGGEST JUMP 
FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS INFLATES TERM 
IS NOW THREE PER CENT INFLATION MUCH OF 
IT IS DOWN TO THE BASICS RISING 
PRICES FOR THINGS LIKE MEAT AND 
FISH AT THE SUPERMARKET AS WELL AS 
FUEL AT THE PUMPS HUGH PYM HAS 
COUNTED THE COST 
THIS IS ABOUT THE SORT OF 
ESSENTIALS YOU WOULD FIND IN THE 
FRIDGE OR EVERYDAY ITEMS AROUND 
THE KITCHEN AND HOW MUCH THE PRICES 
OF MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN GOING UP 
TAKE BREAD FOR EXAMPLE ACCORDING 
TO THE RETAIL PRICES INDEX ACCORDING TO THE FIGURES THIS IS 
OVER THE LAST YEAR NEITHER OF 
THOSE HAVE BEEN ANYTHING LIKE 
BETTER 
HOW DO SHOPPERS FEEL ABOUT IT WE 
CAUGHT UP WITH KAREN WILSON AFTER 
HER TRIP TO BUY THE GROCERIES I I HAVE NOTICED THE BILLS ARE GOING UP 
THINGS THAT ARE MORE OBVIOUS TO ME 
OUR BREAD MILK BASICS THAT I 
WOULD TAKE FOR GRANTED THEY HAVE 
ADDED TEN P. TWENTY P. ONE L. HAVE TO BE 
CAREFUL IN WHAT I BUY AND WHEN I 
BUY IT THE LITTLE TREATS ARE MORE 
LIMITED FOR THE CHILDREN 
WHY IS INFLATION SURGING FOOD 
MANUFACTURERS LIKE BAKERS ARE 
SEEING RAW MATERIAL COSTS ARE 
RISING AND THEY HAVE TO PASS THEM 
ON TO CUSTOMERS FUEL PRICES ARE ON 
THE INCREASE SO THE COST OF 
TRANSPORTING GOODS TO THE SHOP HAS 
GONE UP 
THERE IS THE RISE IN THE 
OIL PRICES WE HAVE SEEN OVER RECENT 
MONTHS IN COMBINATION WITH A 
SIGNIFICANT RISE IN FOOD PRICES A 
LOT OF IT LED BY WHAT HAD BEEN A 
VERY STRONG GLOBAL ECONOMY THE THE COST OF LIVING IS ACCELERATING AND 
THE AUTHORITIES DO NOT WANT IT TO 
GET OUT OF HAND GIVING MONEY AWAY 
IN THE SHAPE OF INTEREST RATE CUTS 
IS HARD TO JUSTIFY THE HOUSING 
MARKET IS WEAKENING CONFIDENCE IS 
EBBING AWAY AND SOME ARE CRYING OUT 
FOR RATE REDUCTIONS IT IS AN 
AGONISING DILEMMA FOR THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND SOME PRICES ARE FALLING 
CLOTHING AND ELECTRICAL ITEMS BUT 
MANY GOODS ARE RISING RAPIDLY THE 
INFLATION PICTURE HAS BECOME A REAL 
HEADACHE HEADACHE THE HOUSING MINISTER CAROLINE FLINT 
IS UNWITTINGLY HAS UNWITTINGLY 
REVEALED HER FEARS FOR THE STATE OF 
THE ECONOMY AS SHE WALKED UP TO 
NUMBER TEN FOREIGN MEETING THIS 
MORNING A SHARP EYED PHOTOGRAPHER 
NOTICED THE NOTES SHE WAS CARRYING 
IN A CLEAR FOLDER THEY MAGNIFY ITS 
TO THIS GLOOMY PREDICTION THEY 
WERE MAGNIFIED 
SOME NEWS JUST IN A NINETEEN YEAR OLD 
MAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE MURDER OF JIMMY THE SIXTEEN 
YEAR OLD KILLED IN A BAKERY IN 
SOUTH EAST LONDON AT THE WEEKEND 
THE ATTACK HAPPENED JUST FIVE HUNDRED YARDS 
FROM HIS HOME 
NATIONAL TESTS IN SCHOOLS ACROSS 
ENGLAND ARE DAMAGING CHILDREN'S 
EDUCATION THAT WAS THAT YOU HAVE 
AN INFLUENTIAL COMMITTEE OF M. P.'S 
TODAY THEY SAY TEACHERS ARE 
SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME DRILLING 
PUPILS FOR EXAMS AND THEY WANT THE 
CURRENT SYSTEM SCRAPPED AS JAMES 
WESTHEAD REPORTS 
SO IT'S NICE AND UPRIGHT CHILDREN 
SET 
WE MAY SHED AT THE MEMORY OF 
TESTS BUT ARE THEY GETTING 
RESULTS SHOWED A M. P.'S CLAIMED 
THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF S. A. T. 
TESTS ARE DOING CHILDREN MORE HARM 
THAN GOOD OUR PUPILS REALLY TOO 
STRESSED WE FOLLOW ITS ELEVEN YEAR OLD 
EMILY SHARP FROM HAMPSHIRE 
PREPARING FOR HER S. A. T.'S THIS MORNING 
SOME LINK OVER TESTING TO ANXIETY 
UNLESS SCHOOLS MANAGE THE PRESSURE 
CARE FOR A 
THEY ARE QUITE EASY FOR 
ME BECAUSE I AM QUITE A GOOD WRITER 
CAREFULLY 
I ENJOY WRITING L. I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR ASSESSMENT 
BUT PARTICULARLY AT HER RAGE TEN TO ELEVEN 
THERE IS LOT OF PRESSURE TO PUT 
THEM UNDER HER AGE 
M. P.'S SAY THAT IT IS A ROUNDED 
EDUCATION IS NARROWED TO JUST 
ENGLISH MATHS AND SCIENCE AS 
SCHOOLS DESPERATELY DRILL THEIR 
PUPILS TO GET THE BEST RESULTS WE WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM ABOUT BEING 
HELD TO ACCOUNT BUT WE THINK 
THERE'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE BASED ON 
THESE PARTICULAR TESTS IN TERMS OF 
SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY 
THIS LATEST 
CRITICISM FROM M. P.'S ADD TO A CHORUS 
OF CONCERN ABOUT NATIONAL TESTING 
THEIR HAS NOW BEEN A BATTERY OF 
WARNINGS FROM OFFICIAL BODIES THAT 
FAR FROM RAISING STANDARDS THEY 
MAY BE ACTUALLY HARMING CHILDREN'S 
EDUCATION EDUCATION DOES THAT MEAN IT IS TIME FOR A 
CHANGE HERE IN WALES THEY 
SCRAPPED SAT ALTOGETHER FOUR YEARS 
AGO AND HAVE MORE TIME FOR FUN 
SCRAPPED S. A. T.'S THE MAN WHO CREATED 
THEM SAYS THAT THAT WOULD ENDANGER 
STANDARDS 
PARENTS WANT TO KNOW NOT STANDARDS ONLY HAVE THEIR CHILD IS DOING BUT 
HOW THE SCHOOL IS DOING IN RELATION 
TO OTHERS HOW THEIR CHILD IS 
DOING 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE DOING TESTS ARE HERE TO STAY BUT IT IS 
PILOTING WAYS OF REDUCING THE 
PUPILS PRESSURE ON PUPILS AND 
SCHOOLS SCHOOLS THE SPANISH CITY OF BARCELONA IS SO 
DESPERATE FOR DRINKING WATER THAT 
OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SHIP 
IT IN FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY SPAIN IS IN THE MIDDLE OF 
ITS WORST DROUGHT IN DECADES OUR 
ENVIRONMENT CORRESPONDENT DAVID 
SHUKMAN REPORTS ON WHETHER 
BARCELONA'S WATER CRISIS IS A SIGN 
OF THINGS TO COME 
AN ORDINARY VESSEL WITH AN 
INCREDIBLY PRECIOUS CARGO THIS WAS 
THE MOMENT THAT BARCELONA BECAME 
THE FIRST MAJOR EUROPEAN CITY TO 
HAVE A SHIP SUPPLY IT WITH WATER 
USUALLY IT IS A OIL OR CONTAINERS 
THAT ARRIVE HERE BUT BARCELONA 
FINDS ITSELF SO SHORT OF WATER THAT 
THIS WILL BE THE FIRST OF NEARLY 
TWO HUNDRED DELIVERIES OR BECAUSE OF A 
DROUGHT THAT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE ALL 
BECAUSE ACROSS BARCELONA THE 
IMPACT IS CLEAR THE FAMOUS 
FOUNTAINS HAVE BEEN STOPPED WATER 
RESTRICTIONS ARE IN PLACE THE 
NOZZLES ARE BONE DRY EVEN BEFORE 
THE FULL HEAT OF SUMMER WE 
TRAVELLED INTO THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE 
BARCELONA TO SEE THE SOURCE OF THE 
PROBLEM THIS RESERVOIR AS 
ALARMINGLY LOW YOU CAN SEE ALONG 
THE WATER'S EDGE THE STRIPE OF BARE 
ROCK BELOW THE TREE LINE SHOWING 
JUST HOW MUCH THE WATER LEVEL HAS 
FALLEN THE RESERVOIR NOW HAS JUST 
EIGHTEEN PER CENT OF ITS NATURAL NORMAL 
CAPACITY WHERE I AM NOW SHOULD BE 
UNDER FORTY TO FIFTY METRES OF WATER 
THIS IS SPAIN'S DRIEST YEAR ON 
RECORD MEANING THAT THIS MEDIEVAL 
VILLAGE FLOODED FOR THE LAST FORTY 
YEARS IS NOW EXPOSED ONCE AGAIN 
THE WATER IS STILL FLOWING BUT 
PEOPLE ARE AWARE THEY MAY YET FACE 
THE THREAT OF RATIONING THIS LADY 
IS AN ENVIRONMENT ACT ACTIVIST 
AND IS AMONG THOSE WHO BLAMES THE 
POLITICIANS FOR NOT TACKLING THE 
SHORTAGE SOON ENOUGH 
SOME PEOPLE 
SAY THAT WE HAVE DONE ENOUGH AS 
CITIZENS NOW IT IS TIME FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT 
BACK AT THE PORT GOVERNMENT INSPECTORS HAD ON BOARD TO TEST THE 
WATER THIS EXTRAORDINARY OPERATION 
OPERATION IS MEANT TO FILL A GAP 
UNTIL A NEW PIPELINE IS BUILT WITH 
SCIENTIST FORECASTING DRIER

SHIP REVEALS HOW RADICALLY EVEN THE 
MOST PROSPEROUS CITIES MAY HAVE TO 
ADAPT ADAPT FINALLY A TEENAGER HAS BEEN
