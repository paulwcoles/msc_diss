HELLO AND WELCOME 
I'M MATTHEW WRIGHT 
YOU'RE WATCHING INSIDE OUT LONDON 
HERE'S WHAT'S COMING UP 
ON TONIGHT'S SHOW 
ROTTEN TEETH WHY N. H. S. DENTISTS 
ARE TURNING AWAY PATIENTS 
WHO NEED THEM MOST 
AN IDEAL N. H. S. PATIENT IS SOMEBODY 
WHO NEEDS VERY LITTLE TREATMENT 
CAN AL LIFELINE BE THROWN TO SAVE 
OUR POST OFFICES 
THERE IS NO ARGUMENT 
THAT POST OFFICES ARE ONLY 
SO COMMUNITIES CAN KEEP THEM ALIVE 
AND WE REVEAL THE HIDDEN LINKS 
BETWEEN OUR HOMES AND LONDON'S MOST 
FAMOUS CLOCK TOWER 
HE REALLY CHANGED THE FACE 
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE MIND 
OF ENGLISH ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN 
TWO YEARS AGO 
THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED 
NEW CONTRACTS FOR N. H. S. DENTISTS 
CONTRACTS THAT WERE DESIGNED TO 
HELP YOU AND I GET TREATMENT 
BUT THE BRITISH DENTAL ASSOCIATION 
HAS BRANDED THEM AL FAILURE 
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO NEED 
TREATMENT THE MOST HAVE BEEN LEFT 
HIGH AND DRY YOU SEE 
UNDER THE NEW TERMS 
THERE'S VERY LITTLE FINANCIAL 
INCENTIVE FOR DENTISTS 
TO TREAT PATIENTS 
WHO ARE HIGH MAINTENANCE 
THE PATIENTS ARE NOT HAPPY 
HE LOOKED AT MY MOUTH AND HE SAID 
THAT HE COULDN'T 
TREAT MY TEETH ON THE N. H. S. 
I WAS DEFINITELY GIVEN THE 
IMPRESSION THAT 
MY CREDIT WAS USED UP ON THE N. H. S. 
AND THE DENTISTS 
ARE NOT HAPPY EITHER 
AN IDEAL N. H. S. PATIENT IS SOMEBODY 
WHO NEEDS VERY LITTLE TREATMENT 
BECAUSE A DENTIST WILL GET THE SAME 
MONEY FOR DOING 
A SIMPLE FILLING AS A COMPLICATED 
MOLAR ROOT CANAL TREATMENT 
WELL THAT'S UTTERLY LUDICROUS 
IN FACT THERE WOULD BE SITUATIONS 
WHERE IT MAY WELL BE WORTHWHILE 
FOR THE DENTIST TO ACTUALLY TURN 
ROUND TO THE PATIENT AND SAY 
HERE'S SOME MONEY 
PLEASE GO ELSEWHERE 
TWO YEARS AGO THE GOVERNMENT 
CHANGED THE CONTRACT 
UNDER WHICH DENTISTS WORK 
FOR THE N. H. S. 
THE IDEA THEY SAID WAS TO IMPROVE 
PATIENT CHOICE AND ACCESS 
BUT THE LATEST FIGURES SUGGEST THAT 
HALF A MILLION FEWER ADULTS 
AND SEVENTY THOUSAND FEWER CHILDREN 
ARE GETTING N. H. S. CARE THAN BEFORE 
ONE THOUSAND DENTISTS HAVE ALSO LEFT 
THE HEALTH SERVICE 
CRITICS OF THE NEW CONTRACT SAY 
SOMETHING IS ROTTEN IN THE STATE OF 
N. H. S. DENTISTRY AND THEY'RE NOT 
JUST TALKING ABOUT TEETH 
ONE DAY IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR 
INTERIOR DESIGNER REBECCA 
WOKE UP WITH 
AN EXCRUCIATING TOOTHACHE 
I HAD VERY BAD PAIN IN MY EYE TOOTH 
HERE ABSOLUTELY AGONY IN FACT 
I WENT TO MY N. H. S. DENTIST 
HE SAID WELL YOU KNOW 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR THIS 
WELL I SAID 
SURELY IT'S ON THE N. H. S. 
HE SAID WELL YOU'VE HAD SO MUCH 
WORK DONE 
WE CANT REALLY OFFER YOU 
ANYTHING MORE ON N. H. S. 
THEY GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION THAT 
I'D USED UP MY N. H. S. CREDIT LIMIT 
WELL THAT DOESN'T EXIST 
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS 
AN INDIVIDUAL PATIENT'S ALLOCATION 
HE SAID THAT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT 
A GRAND 
AND I SUGGEST YOU GO AWAY 
AND TRY AND FIND IT 
AND I REMEMBER SAYING TO HIM 
I DON'T HAVE THIS KIND OF MONEY 
HE SAID WELL GOING TO BE 
IN FOR A BIG PROBLEM 
REBECCA WAS EVENTUALLY TREATED FOR 
FREE AT THIS PRACTICE IN FULHAM 
IT'S THE BIGGEST N. H. S. DENTISTRY 
IN THE CAPITAL 
WITH OVER SIXTY THOUSAND PATIENTS 
AND SIX HUNDRED NEWCOMERS EVERY MONTH 
BUSINESS IS BOOMING BUT MANAGER 
SHARON BIERER 
AND HER DENTIST HUSBAND HENRIK 
WHO RUN THE PRACTICE 
ARE NO FANS OF THE CURRENT CONTRACT 
L. THINK THIS NEW CONTRACT THAT WAS 
IMPOSED ON US BY THE GOVERNMENT 
IS ABSOLUTELY CATASTROPHIC 
GENERALLY POOR PEOPLE 
HAVE GOT WORSE DENTAL HEALTH 
THAN RICH PEOPLE 
AND THEREFORE IT'S THE POOR PEOPLE 
THAT HAVE THE HIGH TREATMENT NEEDS 
AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE BEING 
DISINCENTIVISED IN THIS NEW CONTACT 
WHICH I FIND ASTONISHING 
MEET DENNIS A FORMER ALCOHOLIC 
WHO WAS HOMELESS FOR TEN YEARS 
A TIME IN WHICH HIS HEALTH AND 
HIS TEETH SUFFERED SEVERE NEGLECT 
ON TOP OF THAT THREE WEEKS AGO HE 
WAS PUNCHED IN THE MOUTH 
AND LOST ANOTHER COUPLE OF TEETH 
UNDER THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT 
CONTRACT HE IS PRECISELY 
THE KIND OF PATIENT THAT GIVES 
TODAY'S N. H. S. DENTISTS NIGHTMARES 
DENNIS IS A HIGH NEEDS PATIENT WITH 
A LONG STANDING PHOBIA OF DENTISTS 
I HEARD LOADS OF HORROR STORIES 
ABOUT DENTISTS 
WHERE THEY'VE BUTCHERED 
PEOPLE'S MOUTHS 
WHEN I DO GO I COULD SHAKE INSIDE 
MY PAIN THRESHOLD IS VERY LOW 
BUT AS THINGS STAND DENTISTS ARE 
MORE LIKELY TO BE SCARED OF DENNIS 
THEY DON'T GET PAID ANY MORE 
FOR TREATING HIM 
THAN SOMEONE WHO NEEDS A QUICK 
AND SIMPLE FILLING 
HE'S AGREED TO TEST TEN 
OF LONDON'S N. H. S. DENTISTS FOR US 
LATER WE'LL FIND OUT IF THEY'RE 
PREPARED TO TAKE HIM ON 
GOOD MORNING 
MARYLEBONE DENTAL PRACTICE 
NO I'M AFRAID WE'RE NOT TAKING ON 
ANY NEW NATIONAL HEALTH PATIENTS 
AT THIS PRACTICE IN MARYLEBONE 
THEY'VE ALREADY MADE THEIR DECISION 
THEY NO LONGER TAKE N. H. S. PATIENTS 
POINTING OUT THAT 
SOMEONE AS NEEDY AS DENNIS 
IS A FINANCIAL LIABILITY 
IT'S INEVITABLE THAT THERE 
WILL BE PATIENTS 
WHO ARE LESS ATTRACTED TO DENTISTS 
IT'S A STRESSFUL ENOUGH JOB AND IF 
A DENTIST FEELS THAT ACCEPTING 
A PATIENT IS GOING TO CAUSE 
PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF TIME 
ECONOMIC OUTLAY THEN IT'S ONLY 
NATURAL THAT THEY'RE GOING TO 
THINK WELL ACTUALLY I WISH 
THIS PATIENT HADN'T COME IN 
WHEN DENNIS DID GO IN FOUR 
DENTISTS IN OUR SURVEY SUGGESTED 
HE MIGHT PREFER 
TO BE TREATED IN HOSPITAL 
WHERE HE'D GET BETTER 
ANAESTHETIC CARE 
THEY SAID I COULD GO TO THE 
HOSPITAL IF I WANTED TO 
IF I WAS THAT SCARED OF NEEDLES 
ONE PRACTICE OFFERED A SURPRISINGLY 
LIGHT COURSE OF TREATMENT 
THEY SAID I NEEDED TWO TEETH OUT 
AND TWO FILLINGS 
TWO EXTRACTIONS AND TWO FILLINGS 
IS THAT REALLY ALL HE NEEDS O. K. O. K. HI DENNIS I'M HENRIK 
HELLO HENRIK 
WE'RE GOING TO DO A CHECK UP TODAY 
WE ASKED HENRIK AT THE N. H. S. PRACTICE 
IN FULHAM TO GIVE US HIS VERDICT 
ON HOW MUCH DENTAL WORK 
DENNIS REQUIRES 
WELL IN MY OPINION THE FIRST 
THING IS TO SEE THE HYGIENIST 
TO GET HIS ORAL HYGIENE BETTER 
HE NEEDS THREE FILLINGS 
HE NEEDS TWO TEETH TAKEN OUT 
TO START WITH ADD ON THE TEETH WE 
TAKE OUT ONTO HIS DENTURE 
THEN IN THREE TO SIX MONTHS 
PROBABLY A NEW DENTURE 
O. K. WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE 
QUITE A LOT OF TREATMENT 
IS IT ALL AVAILABLE ON THE N. H. S. 
YEAH YEAH BUT WHEN DENNIS WENT TO ONE N. H. S. 
PRACTICE IN SOUTH LONDON 
THEY DIDN'T QUITE SEE IT THAT WAY 
WHEN SHE LOOKED IN MY MOUTH 
SHE SAID WOW 
THE DENTIST WENT ON TO TELL HIM HIS 
TEETH WERE UNBELIEVABLE 
AND THAT BECAUSE HE'S A SMOKER 
SHE COULDN'T GO NEAR HIS MOUTH 
MY TEETH ARE TOO FAR GONE 
AND SHE WAS ALLERGIC TO SMOKE 
ALLERGIC TO SMOKE 
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID YES 
BUT SHE WAS WILLING TO TAKE OUT MY 
TOOTH THAT WAS LOOSE 
BUT WASN'T WILLING TO TAKE ME ON 
AS A PATIENT 
N. H. S. DENTISTS ARE NOT ALLOWED 
TO PICK AND CHOOSE PATIENTS 
AS HIS TREATMENT 
IS ALL CLINICALLY NECESSARY 
ANYONE WHO TURNS DENNIS AWAY 
IS IN BREACH OF CONTRACT 
BUT FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF 
VIEW VIEW TAKING HIM ON MAKES LITTLE SENSE 
WE'RE PAYING THE HYGIENIST TWENTY EIGHT 
OUR LAB BILL WILL BE ABOUT 
FOURTEEN PER TOOTH TO ADD ON 
AND SO WE WILL PROBABLY 
END UP WITH ABOUT TEN 
OUT OF THE COURSE OF TREATMENT 
SO FOR SEVEN VISITS AS AL DENTAL PRACTICE PRACTICE YOU WILL GET THE PRINCELY SUM 
OF TEN CORRECT CORRECT THE NEW N. H. S. CONTRACT WAS DESIGNED 
BY THE MANDARINS 
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 
TO REPLACE A SYSTEM UNDER WHICH 
DENTISTS GOT PAID 
PER ITEM OF WORK DONE 
WHAT USED TO BE KNOWN 
AS DRILL AND FILL 
WE WANT THEM TO WORK 
IN A SIMPLER WAY 
ISN'T THIS TOO SIMPLE 
I MEAN HOW CAN IT MAKE SENSE TO 
PAY DENTISTS EXACTLY THE SAME 
FOR DOING FIFTEEN MINUTES OF WORK 
AS IT DOES FOR MONTHS OF WORK 
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ABOUT LOOKING 
AT INDIVIDUAL ITEMS OF TREATMENT 
WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND 
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM 
I WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT ANY 
DENTIST WOULD ACTUALLY PUT 
HIS OWN FINANCIAL GAIN IN FRONT OF 
THE CLINICAL CARE OF HIS PATIENTS 
THAT'S HUMAN NATURE ISN'T IT 
PART OF BEING PROFESSIONAL IS YOU 
PUT YOUR PATIENTS' RIGHTS AND 
WELFARE IN FRONT OF YOUR OWN 
BUT IN THE REAL WORLD NOT ALL OF 
LONDON'S N. H. S. DENTISTS ARE QUITE SO 
HIGH MINDED 
AS DENNIS FOUND AGAIN WHEN HE 
VISITED A PRACTICE IN WEST LONDON 
HE LOOKED IN MY MOUTH AND HE SAID 
THAT HE COULDN'T TREAT MY TEETH ON 
THE N. H. S. MY TEETH WERE TOO FAR GONE 
YOUR TEETH WERE TOO FAR GONE FOR 
THE N. H. S. YES YES BUT HE WAS WILLING TO DO IT ON THE 
PRIVATE PRIVATE IT WAS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FATAL 
FOR ME IF HE TOOK A TOOTH OUT 
FATAL YEAH FATAL YEAH HE USED THAT WORD FATAL YEAH YEAH AS IN LIFE THREATENING 
WELL APPARENTLY YEAH 
THAT IF YOU HAD A TOOTH TAKEN OUT 
THAT YOU COULD DIE 
BUT NOT IF YOU WENT PRIVATE NO NO DENNIS WILL NOW GO BACK TO THE N. H. S. 
PRACTICE IN FULHAM WHERE NO ONE IS 
ALLERGIC TO HIS TEETH OR CONSIDERS 
THEM TO BE POTENTIALLY FATAL 
THIS STORY SHOULD END HAPPILY 
ENOUGH FOR DENNIS WHO CAN LOOK 
FORWARD TO FINE SET OF TEETH SOON 
BUT IF HIS EXPERIENCE WITH SOME OF 
THE DENTISTS IN THIS REPORT ARE 
ANYTHING TO GO BY 
OTHER HIGH NEED PATIENTS AND 
INDEED DENTISTS THEMSELVES ARE 
GETTING A ROTTEN DEAL UNDER THE 
CURRENT N. H. S. CONTRACT 
STILL TO COME 
THE VICTORIAN VISIONARY WHO'S STILL 
SHAPING THE WAY WE LIVE TODAY 
HE DID DESIGN EVERYTHING 
CATHEDRALS TO TEA CADDIES 
AND HE BELIEVED THAT 
THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN 
RAN THROUGH EVERYTHING 
FOR DECADES POST OFFICES ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY HAVE BEEN CENTRAL 
TO THE COMMUNITY OFFERING 
PERSONAL OVER THE COUNTER SERVICE 
BUT WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY AND 
COMPETITION THE TRADITIONAL POST 
OFFICE IS BEING DRIVEN OUT OF 
BUSINESS AND ACCORDING TO THE 
GOVERNMENT LOSING US FOUR M. PER WEEK 
NEXT MONTH ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY POST OFFICES ACROSS 
THE CAPITAL FACE CLOSURE 
BUT CAMPAIGNERS SAY THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS BEING SHORT SIGHTED 
AND THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO 
CONTINUE THIS VITAL SERVICE 
JOANNE GOOD HAS THE STORY 
AS ANYONE WHO HAS EVER STOOD IN ONE 
OF THESE QUEUES KNOWS 
YOUR LOCAL POST OFFICE IS A VITAL 
SOCIAL RESOURCE 
MANY BRANCHES OFFER A FRIENDLY 
PERSONAL SERVICE THEY KNOW THEIR 
PATRONS AND ALL THEIR NEEDS 
LESLEY WHO IS BLIND FACES NEW 
CHALLENGE IN HER LIFE AS THE LOCAL 
POST OFFICE SHE USES EVERY DAY IN 
ASKEW ROAD IS ABOUT TO CLOSE 
I USE IT FOR BANKING 
FOR SENDING PARCELS 
ALL THE USUAL THINGS 
I CANNOT USE AN A. T. M. TO DRAW CASH 
SO FOR ME IT'S A WAY OF BEING 
INDEPENDENT WITH MY OWN MONEY 
IN HAMMERSMITH SEVEN POST OFFICES 
ARE DUE TO CLOSE TWO IN ASKEW RD 
POCKLINGTON LODGE IS HOME FOR 
BLIND AND PARTIALLY SIGHTED 
RESIDENTS MOST OF WHOM GO TO THE 
POST OFFICE WHICH IS FIVE MINUTES' 
WALK AWAY EVERY DAY 
TO GET TO THE NEAREST ASKEW RD 
BRANCH RESIDENTS LESLEY ANDREW AND 
PETER HAVE A FAMILIAR ROUTE 
WHICH ONLY INVOLVES CROSSING ONE 
MAJOR ROAD 
KNOWING WHERE THE LOCAL SHOPS ARE 
EXACTLY WHERE A SHOP IS 
THE POST OFFICE MY DOCTOR THE 
TUBE STATION 
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO GET TO THESE 
PLACES IF YOU PUT ME SOMEWHERE 
ELSE I COULDN'T DO THESE THINGS 
I'D BE LOST 
FAMILIARITY IS ALL IMPORTANT 
FOR YOU TO LEARN NEW ROUTES TO GO 
ANYWHERE 
FOR A BLIND PERSON 
YOU'RE GUIDED BY THINGS LIKE 
TRAFFIC NOISE 
WE COULD POSSIBLY LEARN THE WAY 
IF THE NEAREST POST OFFICE TO 
POCKLINGTON LODGE CLOSES 
THEN THE BLIND AND PARTIALLY 
SIGHTED RESIDENTS HAVE ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED 
YARDS TO WALK TO THE SECOND POST 
OFFICE ON ASKEW RD 
BUT THAT ONE IS ALSO DUE TO CLOSE 
IF BOTH ASKEW RD POST OFFICES CLOSE 
THEN THE RESIDENTS WILL EITHER 
HAVE TO WALK FOR ANOTHER FIFTEEN FIFTEEN 
MINUTES TO A SUB POST OFFICE 
IN HAMMERSMITH OR CATCH A BUS TO 
THE MAIN BRANCH AT SHEPHERDS BUSH 
GREEN 
CLOSING THAT POST OFFICE WILL BE A 
MAJOR PROBLEM 
TO MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE 
IT MAKES LIFE MASSIVELY DIFFICULT 
FOR ANY OF US HERE WHO ARE BLIND 
THIS IS WHAT I FIND DIFFICULT 
TO UNDERSTAND 
IF THEY NEED TO CLOSE POST OFFICES 
WHY SO MANY 
THERE IS NO PRICE TO BE PLACED 
ON THE HEAD OF INDEPENDENCE 
I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT IT SHOULD 
NOT BE ERODED IN THAT WAY 
THE POST OFFICE CONDUCTED SIX 
WEEK PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON 
CLOSURES WHICH ENDED LAST WEEK 
AND PETER FROM POCKLINGTON LODGE 
WAS THERE TO ADDRESS 
A LARGE LOCAL GATHERING OF 
CAMPAIGNERS AND POLITICIANS 
YOU GET A PERSONAL SERVICE 
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET THAT 
AT A POST OFFICE IN 
THE HAMMERSMITH SHOPPING MALL 
IT'S SO DIFFICULT WALKING THROUGH 
THAT BUSY MALL 
YOU GET INTO THIS MAIN POST OFFICE 
ITSELF SO MANY PEOPLE IN THERE 
IT'S VERY AWKWARD EVEN THE 
GUIDE DOGS CAN'T FIND THEIR WAY 
IT'S VITAL 
WHY IS THE POST OFFICE 
A PROFIT MAKING ORGANISATION 
WHY DON'T THE GOVERNMENT 
SUBSIDISE THE POST OFFICE 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS TOLD 
THE POST OFFICE THAT TWENTY PER CENT MUST GO 
CITING PROFITABILITY AND NEW 
TECHNOLOGY AS THE REASON 
SUDDENLY THINGS HAVE GOT 
COMPLICATED COMPLICATED KEN LIVINGSTONE HAS THROWN IN 
HIS TRUMP CARD 
AND GONE TO THE HIGH COURT FOR 
A JUDICIAL REVIEW 
THAT PROCESS COULD DELAY 
THE EVENTUAL DECISION BY MONTHS 
IF THE JUDGE DECIDES THAT THE 
CONSULTATION HASN'T BEEN ADEQUATE 
CONSERVATIVE MAYORAL CANDIDATE 
BORIS JOHNSON CONTENDS 
THAT THIS IS JUST ELECTIONEERING 
AND THAT KEN LIVINGSTONE 
HAS DONE NOTHING 
TO HELP SAVE THE POST OFFICES 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT BRIAN PADDICK 
MEANWHILE SAYS 
HE'S IN FAVOUR OF THE JUDICIAL 
REVIEW AS WE NEED TO EXPLORE 
EVERY POSSIBILITY OF KEEPING 
THE POST OFFICES OPEN 
WHY NOT SUBSIDISE SOMETHING WHICH 
IS ONLY TO THE GOOD 
THERE IS NO CONTEST 
THAT POST OFFICES ARE ONLY 
SERVING COMMUNITIES 
AND KEEPING THEM ALIVE 
SO THE QUESTION IS 
WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT 
THE BURDEN ON THE TAXPAYER 
UNDERWRITING THESE SMALL BRANCHES 
OR THE BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY 
OF HAVING THEM REMAIN OPEN 
WE WANT TO MAKE A PROFIT 
WE DO NOT WANT SUBSIDIES 
BUT THE COUNCILS AREN'T EVEN 
PUTTING THE BUSINESS OUR WAY 
THERE IS PLENTY OF BUSINESS 
OUT THERE PARKING TICKETS 
THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT 
OF THINGS OUT THERE THAT COULD 
GO THROUGH THE POST OFFICE 
NOBODY WANTS A POST OFFICE TO CLOSE 
I DON'T BUT WE'VE 
GOT TO FACE FACTS 
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH WORK OUT THERE 
WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS MANY 
OF THESE OFFICES WOULD GO BANKRUPT 
WE RECOGNISE THE SOCIAL IMPORTANCE 
OF THE POST OFFICE 
IT'S BIG PART OF THE ROLE 
THAT WE HAVE 
AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS COMMITTED 
TILL TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO GIVE US 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION A YEAR TO MAINTAIN 
NUMBER OF OFFICES WHICH 
IF YOU WERE A PURELY 
COMMERCIAL BUSINESS WOULD CLOSE 
SO WILL THAT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION HELP TO 
SAVE THE OTHER POST OFFICE IN ASKEW 
ROAD FROM CLOSURE 
AND COINCIDES WITH 
THE OWNER MRS. PATEL'S RETIREMENT 
IT'S BEEN HERE FOR QUITE SOME TIME 
I WAS A SINGLE PERSON 
A SINGLE BODY 
WHAT ABOUT NOW 
I'VE GOT SOME EXTRA ONES 
FIVE MINUTES IN HER POST OFFICE AND 
YOU'LL SEE 
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS 
FOR THE LOCAL RESIDENTS 
THIS IS A MEETING PLACE 
WE KNOW 
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT COME HERE 
THEY'VE BEEN COMING FOR YEARS WE WE KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE STILL ALIVE 
THIS IS OUR CENTRE EVERYBODY 
MEETS UP IN THE POST OFFICE 
WE DON'T MEET UP IN THE OTHER SHOPS 
WE MEET HERE 
HOW MUCH DO YOU WORRY ABOUT THE 
LOCAL COMMUNITY IF THIS CLOSES 
A LOT 
I CAN SEE THE PERSONAL FEELING 
INVOLVED 
HOW DEPRESSED THEY GET 
THINKING DAY AND NIGHT 
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WHEN THE 
WEATHER IS BAD IF 
I DON'T GET OUT FROM THE HOUSE HOW 
AM I GOING TO GET MY MONEY 
HOW AM I GOING TO POST MY LETTERS 
PEOPLE ARE WORRYING 
IT'S NOT ONLY THE OLD PEOPLE EVEN 
THE YOUNG PEOPLE 
AFTER THE CLOSURES THEY SAY THAT 
YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO BE MORE THAN 
A MILE AWAY AWAY FROM A POST OFFICE 
BUT FOR PETER THAT MILE IS 
DAUNTING PROSPECT 
HE WANTED TO TRY OUT THE JOURNEY TO 
SEE IF HE COULD MANAGE IT 
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE SHEPHERDS 
BUSH POST OFFICE 
WHEN I GET OFF THE BUS I'M GOING 
TO HAVE TO ASK PEOPLE WHERE THE 
POST OFFICE IS 
IT COULD BE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME 
THAT'S THE SITUATION FOR A BLIND 
PERSON 
AM I NEAR THE POST OFFICE 
STRAIGHT DOWN SHARP RIGHT TURN 
LEFT LEFT WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE HOW TO GET 
SOMEWHERE THEY OFTEN POINT 
I'VE GOT JUST ABOUT ENOUGH VISION 
TO SEE THEM MOVING THEIR ARMS BUT I 
CAN'T SEE WHAT THEY'RE POINTING AT 
I'VE HAD NUTTERS FOLLOWING ME 
SAYING YOU NEVER KNOW WHO YOU'RE 
GOING TO MEET 
I THINK I'VE JUST MET YOU 
FINDING THAT HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW 
WHERE THE POST OFFICE IS HE MANAGES 
TO GET HELP FROM TWO PASSING 
COMMUNITY POLICEMEN 
LEFT AND BIT FURTHER DOWN 
PETER IS ESCORTED RIGHT TO THE DOOR 
WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT LARGE POST 
OFFICES IS WHEN YOU'RE QUEUING IT 
SAYS COUNTER NUMBER ONE 
YOU HAVE TO FIND YOUR WAY 
THEY WON'T NOTICE THERE'S A BLIND 
PERSON WAITING 
SO YOU'RE LEFT WONDERING WHICH 
COUNTER TO GO TO 
YOU HEAR A VOICE GOING ALONG HERE 
DEAR FURTHER FURTHER 
THAT'S HOW THEY DIRECT YOU REMOTE 
CONTROL 
THIS IS THE LAST TIME MRS. PATEL IS 
CLOSING HER POST OFFICE 
IN JUNE IT COULD BE FOR GOOD 
LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK 
MAYBE YOU'RE FIGHTING TO SAVE YOUR 
LOCAL POST OFFICE 
MAYBE YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT'S 
RIGHT TO CLOSE THEM EMAIL YOUR VIEWS TO 
YOUR TYPICAL LONDON HOME HAS A 
HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY LOOK 
STEEP ROOFS AND GABLES WINDOWS OF 
DIFFERENT SIZES CHIMNEY TO ONE 
SIDE HAVE YOU EVER STOPPED TO 
WONDER WHY 
IT'S ALL DOWN TO ECCENTRIC 
VICTORIAN ARCHITECT AUGUSTUS PUGIN 
HIS DESIGNS BECAME THE TEMPLATE FOR 
THE HOMES WE LIVE IN TODAY 
HERE'S MORE ABOUT HIS EXTRAORDINARY 
LEGACY LEGACY YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD OF HIM BUT 
YOU KNOW HIS WORK 
HE DESIGNED EVERY INTRICATE DETAIL 
OF THE INTERIOR OF THE HOUSE OF 
LORDS AND THE MOST FAMOUS CLOCK 
TOWER IN THE WORLD 
AUGUSTUS PUGIN WAS THE TOP 
ARCHITECT OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
AND ALMOST TWO CENTURIES LATER 
HIS INFLUENCE IS STILL BEING FELT 
IN THE WAY WE LIVE 
PERHAPS HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT 
WAS THE BUILDING HE DESIGNED 
FOR HIMSELF 
IT'S CALLED THE GRANGE 
COMPLETED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY FOUR IT WAS 
REVOLUTIONARY REVOLUTIONARY AUTHOR ROSEMARY HILL PROBABLY KNOWS 
MORE ABOUT PUGIN THAN ANYONE ELSE 
SHE TOLD ME WHY THIS HOUSE WAS SO 
UNUSUAL FOR ITS TIME 
MOST PEOPLE LIVED IN TERRACES OR 
LITTLE VILLAS 
YOUR HOUSE SHOULD BE NEAT 
SYMMETRICAL SYMMETRICAL WHILE OTHER ARCHITECTS WORK FROM 
THE OUTSIDE IN 
FOCUSING THEIR ATTENTION ON WHAT 
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE PAVEMENT 
PUGIN DID THE OPPOSITE 
FOR HIM THE INTERIOR WAS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THING 
SO HE DECIDED TO DESIGN HIS ROOMS 
FIRST THAT MEANT THE OUTSIDE HAD 
TO LOOK LIKE THIS 
THERE IN THE BAY WINDOWS 
THERE IN THE BAY WINDOWS YOU'VE GOT 
THE TWO PRINCIPAL ROOMS HIS WORK 
ROOM AND HIS ABOVE IT HIS BEDROOM 
SO THAT SHOWS YOU WHERE THE 
IMPORTANT THINGS ARE 
YOU'VE GOT THE STAIRCASE WINDOWS 
DOWN THE TOWER 
BUT IT'S INSIDE THE GRANGE WHERE 
YOU CAN BEST SEE WHERE HOW PUGIN'S 
GREATEST INVENTION THE FLOOR PLAN 
WORKS WORKS THE SITTING ROOM THE LIBRARY THE 
BEDROOMS IN FACT THE WHOLE HOUSE 
PLACED AROUND THE CENTRAL HUB OF 
THE HALL 
IT'S CENTRAL TO PUGIN'S WHOLE IDEA 
OF WHAT THE HOUSE SHOULD BE ABOUT 
IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO BE A ROOM IN 
ITSELF IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE A 
PARTY IN WHICH HE SOMETIMES DID 
AS YOU UP THE STAIRS ALL THE WAY 
ROUND YOU CAN SEE THE DOORS OF THE 
BEDROOMS BEDROOMS THE DESIGN WAS SO BRILLIANT IT 
BECAME THE TEMPLATE FOR HOW HOUSES 
SHOULD BE BUILT 
EACH SPACE PLACED FOR A PURPOSE TO 
ALLOW FOR PRIVACY WHEN YOU NEEDED 
IT AND OPEN PLAN LIVING WHEN YOU 
DIDN'T 
AND PUGIN'S ULTIMATE TEST EVEN 
WITH HIS EIGHT CHILDREN HE WAS 
STILL ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME 
PUGIN ISN'T A VERY ENGLISH SOUNDING 
NAME BUT THAT'S COS HIS FATHER WAS 
FRENCH FRENCH AND I WONDER IF THERE WAS BIT OF 
SWEDISH BLOOD IN THE FAMILY COS HE 
EVEN CAME UP WITH THE CRAZY IDEA OF 
FLAT PACKED FURNITURE 
PUGIN WAS A WORKAHOLIC DESIGNING 
DOZENS OF HOUSES CHURCHES AND 
CATHEDRALS DOWN TO THE SMALLEST 
DETAILS DETAILS SO HERE IN HIS OWN HOUSE HE DIDN'T 
JUST PLAN THE ROOMS HE DESIGNED 
EVERYTHING THAT WENT IN THEM FROM 
THE TILES ON THE FLOOR TO THE 
CHANDELIERS HANGING FROM THE 
CEILING HE EVEN DESIGNED THE DOOR KNOBS 
TODAY THE GRANGE HAS BEEN RESTORED 
TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE 
THIS IS WHERE WE MADE OUR BIG 
DISCOVERY DISCOVERY BUT WHEN MAUREEN O'CONNOR FIRST SAW 
IT IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX IT WAS DERELICT SHE 
HELPED WITH THE RESTORATION 
IT INVOLVED LOT OF DETECTIVE WORK 
AND A GOOD DEAL OF LUCK 
THIS WALLPAPER WE HAD SKETCH OF 
THE DESIGN IN A LETTER TO HIS 
DECORATOR DECORATOR WE HAD OTHER DESCRIPTIONS OF IT IN 
MORE LETTERS ABOUT GETTING THE 
HOUSE READY 
BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE IT 
UNTIL THEY REMOVED THE PANELLING 
FROM THE DAMP WALLS AND FOUND 
PIECE OF PUGIN'S PAPER IN ALL ITS 
GLORY GLORY THERE IT WAS THIS WALLPAPER 
MOULDY DAMP FALLING OFF THE WALL 
AND BLACK ALL OVER FROM THE MOULD 
BUT WE KNEW WE HAD THE WALLPAPER 
BECAUSE IT WAS DIRECT ONTO THE 
PLASTER PLASTER THERE'S RECURRING THEME ON ALL 
THE WALLPAPER PICTURE OF SWIFT AND THE WORDS EN AVANT 
THIS WAS PUGIN FAMILY MOTTO MEANING 
FORWARDS APPROPRIATE FOR A MAN 
WHO STILL INFLUENCES ARCHITECTURE 
TODAY 
AT SCHOOLS OF ARCHITECTURE ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY PUGIN'S INFLUENCES ARE 
STILL BEING APPLIED 
HOW WOULD YOU PUGINISE THIS 
IF PUGIN WAS WORKING ON THIS 
BUILDING 
HE WOULDN'T PUT PLASTERBOARD OVER 
IT OR HIDE IT WITH INSULATION HE'D 
SHOW THE STRUCTURE 
SO USING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE 
BUILDING TO MAKE IT LOOK ALMOST 
DECORATIVE 
YES DECORATIVE PUGIN HATED FAKE COLUMNS AND FALSE 
BEAMS HE BELIEVED THAT THE 
SUPPORTING STRUCTURE OF A BUILDING 
SHOULD DICTATE ITS SHAPE THAT FORM 
SHOULD FOLLOW FUNCTION 
A CONCEPT EVIDENT IN MUCH OF THE 
ARCHITECTURE OF THE MODERN ERA 
FLORA IS AN ARCHITECTURE STUDENT 
WORKING IN RAMSGATE 
LIKE TOWNS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
IT'S FULL OF PUGIN'S INFLUENCE 
WE HAVE TO BE SYMPATHETIC TO THIS 
KIND OF ARCHITECTURE 
WE HAVE TO STUDY WHAT'S BEEN DONE 
BEFORE IN ORDER TO PUT NEW 
BUILDINGS IN WHICH WON'T CLASH WITH 
THE SURROUNDINGS 
SO IT HELPS NEW BUILDINGS BE IN 
KEEPING WITH THE OLD ONES YES YES WE DO NEW BUILDINGS WE ALSO 
RENOVATE BUILDINGS SO IN A WAY WE 
DON'T HAVE A CHOICE WE HAVE TO 
LEARN FROM HIM 
WHEN PUGIN DIED HE WAS JUST FORTY BUT 
IN HIS SHORT LIFE HE CREATED 
HUNDREDS OF UNIQUE BUILDINGS AND 
DESIGNS EVEN DESIGNING THE CHURCH 
HE WAS BURIED IN 
IT WAS BUILT RIGHT NEXT TO THE 
GRANGE BECAUSE FOR HIM WORK 
FAMILY AND RELIGION ALL WENT 
TOGETHER TOGETHER A DEVOUT CATHOLIC SINCE HIS EARLY 
TWENTIES HE LOVED THE GOTHIC STYLE 
OF ARCHITECTURE FOUND IN CHURCHES 
AND CATHEDRALS 
HE BELIEVED IT WAS STYLE IMBUED 
WITH SACRED TRUTH 
SO THE BUILDINGS HE DESIGNED 
FEATURED ARCHES TOWERS PITCHED 
ROOFS AND LOTS OF STAINED GLASS 
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY QUITE OBSESSIVE 
HE'S DESIGNED EVERYTHING 
YOU COULD SAY HE WAS AN OBSESSIVE 
AND DID DESIGN EVERYTHING FROM 
CATHEDRALS TO TEA CADDIES 
AND HE BELIEVED THAT THE SAME 
PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN RAN THROUGH 
EVERYTHING EVERYTHING HE DID ALL THIS IN SUCH A SHORT 
SPACE OF TIME 
IT WAS AN 
EXTRAORDINARY LIFE 
BY THE TIME HE WAS TWENTY ONE PUGIN HAD 
BEEN SHIPWRECKED BANKRUPTED AND 
WIDOWED WIDOWED THAT WAS BEFORE HE EVEN STARTED HIS 
CAREER CAREER LN THE LAST NINETEEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE 
HE REALLY CHANGED THE FACE AND 
PROBABLY THE MIND OF ENGLISH 
ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN 
AUGUSTUS PUGIN'S INFLUENCE WAS 
STRONG AND IT STILL IS IF YOU WANT 
TO EXPERIENCE LIFE EXACTLY AS PUGIN 
INTENDED YOU CAN 
TODAY THE GRANGE IS CARED FOR BY 
THE LANDMARK TRUST AND RENTED OUT 
FOR SHORT STAYS 
BUT DEMAND IS HIGH 
THIS BUILDING IS LIVING PROOF OF 
THE BRILLIANCE OF AUGUSTUS PUGIN 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY YEARS AFTER IT WAS BUILT IT'S 
STILL A HOUSE THAT PEOPLE LOVE TO 
LIVE IN 
THAT'S NEARLY ALL FOR THIS WEEK'S 
SHOW COMING UP NEXT WEEK 
FIFTY YEARS ON WHY VICTIMS OF 
THALIDOMIDE ARE STILL FIGHTING FOR 
COMPENSATION COMPENSATION THESE PEOPLE MUST BE MADE TO PAY 
FOR THEIR CRIME THEY HAVE TO PAY 
FOR THEIR CRIME 
THAT IS A BIG HEAVY RAT LOOK AT 
THE SIZE OF THAT 
THERE'S ONE BORN EVERY SECOND 
HOW WE'RE HELPING LONDON'S RATS 
BREED OUT OF CONTROL 
AND THE URBAN MUSIC HOPEFULS 
STRUGGLING TO BE HEARD 
YOU DO GET A LITTLE BIT 
DISHEARTENED WHEN DOORS ARE CLOSED 
AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU FEEL 
SHOULD BE THERE AREN'T
