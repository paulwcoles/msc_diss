A SUPERMARKET SWEEP THE BIG FOUR 
ARE BEING CHECKED OUT AGAIN BY THE 
OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING 
WHAT IS THE OFT UP TO NOW 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY COME 
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR 
A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA HELP FOR THE 
HALIFAX SHAREHOLDERS IN THE 
COMPANY ARE EXPECTED TO BE ASKED 
FOR BILLIONS OF POUNDS IN A 
RUMOURED NEW RIGHTS ISSUE 
WHY YOUR TRIP TO THE COSTAS MIGHT 
END UP COSTING A LITTLE MORE AS 
SOME TOUR OPERATORS ADD EXTRA 
CHARGES FOR YOUR HOLIDAYS 
IT'S THREE YEARS SINCE THE ROVER 
CAR COMPANY CLOSED DOWN SYSTEM I'VE 
COME BACK TO LONGBRIDGE TO FIND OUT 
WHAT IS BEING DONE TO REPLACE THE 
THOUSANDS OF JOBS THAT WERE LOST 
THE FOUR BIGGEST SUPERMARKETS ARE 
UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE OFFICE 
OF FAIR TRADING FOR ALLEGED PRICE 
FIXING IT'S AMERGED THAT ASDA AND 
MORRISONS WERE VISITED BY 
INVESTIGATORS LAST WEEK AND 
SAINSBURY'S AND TESCO HAVE TOLD THE 
B. B. C. THAT THEY ARE CO OPERATING WITH 
INQUIRIES UNILEVER AND PROCTOR AND 
GAMBLE HAVE BEEN VISITED BY THE 
WATCHDOG A JAM PACKED FEW DAYS FOR 
THE OFT RACHEL HAS BEEN TRYING TO 
KEEP UP 
ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER RAID BY THE 
OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING 
THE WATCHDOG HAS BEEN BUSY 
IT TRANSPIRED THIS WEEKEND THAT THE 
OFT ARE LOOKING AT ALLEGED PRICE 
FIXING OF HEALTH BEAUTY AND 
GROCERY PRODUCTS AT BRITAIN'S FOUR 
BIGGEST SUPERMARKETS ON FRIDAY 
THEY ACCUSED TWO TOBACCO FIRMS AND 
ELEVEN RETAILERS OF ENGAGING IN 
UNLAWFUL PRACTICES ON HOW THEY'VE 
BEEN PRICING TOBACCO PRODUCTS ON 
WEAPONS IT WAS THE OFT CRYING OVER 
SPILT MILK WHEN THEY HAD TO ISSUE 
AN APOLOGY AND A CHEQUE FOR 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO MORRISONS THE WATCHDOG 
ADMIT THEY'D WERE WRONG TO CLAIM 
THE SUPERMARKET CHAIN HAD BROKEN 
RULES AND BEEN WARNED OVER FIXING 
THE PRICES OF MILK BUTTER AND 
CHEESE CHEESE A BUSY WEEK BY ANY STANDARDS IT 
SEEMS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE OFFICE OF 
FAIR TRADING IN THE LAST MONTH 
THEY'VE ACCUSED MORE THAN ONE 
HUNDRED CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES OF 
RIGGING BIDS FOR CONTRACTS LOOKED 
INTO MORE REGULATION FOR ESTATE 
AGENTS AND WON A TEST CASE MEANING 
THEY CAN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT BANK 
PENALTY CHARGES ARE FAIR SO ARE 
THE OFT THE CONSUMER'S STRONGEST 
ALLY FIGHTING TO ENSURE WE ARE 
GETTING A GOOD DEAL ARE THEY 
TAKING ON TOO MUCH FOCUSING ON 
HEADLINES RATHER THAN FAIR PLAY AND 
MAKING MISTAKES IN THE PROCESS 
LET'S FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE 
OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING WE WILL 
TALK ABOUT THE FLURRY OF 
INVESTIGATIONS AT THE MOMENT 
RACHEL RACHEL FIRST OF ALL WHAT SORT OF TEETH DO 
THEY HAVE HOW POWERFUL ARE THEY 
THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING ARE 
PRETTY POWERFUL BODY LAST YEAR 
THEY HANDED OUT ONE OF THEIR 
LARGEST EVER FINES THAT WAS 
SLAPPED ON BRITISH AIRWAYS BACK IN 
AUGUST TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THAT WAS FOR PRICE 
FIXING ON FUEL SURCHARGES ON LONG 
HAUL FLIGHTS YOU KNOW FINES 
RUNNING INTO THE MILLIONS ARE NOT 
UNCOMMON IN TWO THOUSAND THREE TEN SPORTS 
RETAILERS SHARED AN OFT FINE OF 
EIGHTEEN POINT SIX MILLION FOR PRICE FIXING ON 
REPLICA FOOTBALL SHIRTS THE OFT 
OPERATE UNDER ALREADY EXISTING 
CONSUMER AND COMPETITION 
LEGISLATION REALLY IF THEY WANT 
ACCESS TO YOUR FILES THERE'S VERY 
LITTLE YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT AS MIKE 
PULLEN A COMPETITION LAWYER TOLD 
ME EARLIER THIS MORNING 
THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING HAVE 
POWERS OF ENTRY SEARCH AND SEIZURE 
THAT MEANS THEY'RE ALLOWED TO ENTER 
COMPANY PREMISES AND SEIZE 
DOCUMENTS INCLUDING IT AND E. MAIL 
RECORDS AND TO INTERVIEW MEMBERS 
OF STAFF 
IF THE OFT MAKE A FINDING THAT A 
COMPANY HAS BEEN IN BREACH OF 
COMPETITION LAW THEY HAVE POWERS 
TO FINE THE COMPANY UP TO TEN PER CENT OF 
ITS TURNOVER IN THE RELEVANT 
PRODUCT MARKETS THEY ALSO HAVE 
POWERS TO BRING CRIMINAL 
PROSECUTIONS AGAINST INDIVIDUAL 
DIRECTORS IF THEY FIND THAT 
DIRECTORS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN 
WHAT IS CALLED HARD CORE 
COMPETITION OFFENCES SUCH AS PRICE 
FIXING BID RIGGING AND THE 
ULTIMATE PENALTY THAT A DIRECTOR 
MAY PAY IS FIVE YEARS' IMPRISONMENT 
AND DISQUALIFICATION AS DIRECTOR 
FOR UP TO FIFTEEN YEARS 
AS MIKE WAS 
SAYING THERE BE VERY AFRAID WHEN 
THESE PEOPLE COME CALLING WHO ARE 
THESE PEOPLE WHAT DO THEY DO 
WHO'S BEHIND THEM 
THE OFFICE OF 
FAIR TRADING WAS ESTABLISHED IN 
NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THEY'RE A NON MINISTERIAL 
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT THEY HAVE A 
MISSION STATEMENT STATING WHAT 
THEIR JOB IS THEY SAY THEY WANT TO 
MAKE MARKETS WORK WELL FOR 
CONSUMERS 
THEY ARE A CONSUMER WATCHDOG 
THEY SAY THEY PRIORITISE THE CASES 
THEY LOOK INTO LOOKING AT 
PRIMARILY WHICH CAUSE THE GREATEST 
THREAT TO CONSUMER WELFARE 
THEY ALSO SPEND A LOT OF TIME 
LOOKING AT ROGUE TRADERS THEY HAVE 
ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED STAFF WHO LOOK MAINLY AT 
GOODS SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
THEY ALSO HAVE A TRADING STANDARDS 
ARM AND THEY RUN CONSUMER DIRECT 
THEY'RE PRETTY BUSY 
DOES THIS 
PLAIN WHY WE'VE HAD A FLURRY OF 
INVESTIGATIONS ARE THEY TRYING TO 
GET MORE ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY DO 
MAKE TEST CASES OR IS IT JUST 
COINCIDENCE 
THERE HAS BEEN A COINCIDENCE FLURRY OF CASES MIKE PUNEL SAID 
EARLIER HE EXPECTS TO SEE THIS 
HIGHER LEVEL OF ACTIVITY SUSTAINED 
BY THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING 
THEIR NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE JOHN 
FINGLETON TOOK OVER AND HE MADE IT 
CLEAR THAT THEY WOULD FOCUS ON 
HIGH PROFILE CASES HE TOOK OVER IN 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE MOST INVESTIGATIONS TAKE 
BETWEEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THREE YEARS 
TO COME FULL CIRCLE WE ARE 
STARTING TO SEE THE FRUITS OF HIS 
LEADERSHIP THE OFFICE OF FAIR 
TRADING AGREE THEIR TARGETS WITH 
THE TREASURY THE TREASURY FUNDS 
THEM THEY AGREED THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
AND TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THEIR TARGET WOULD BE 
THEY WOULD REAP CONSUMER BENEFIT OF 
FIVE TIMES THEIR ANNUAL BUDGET 
THEIR ANNUAL BUDGET IS SIXTY FIVE POINT SEVEN 
MILLION THAT MEANS THAT THEY'VE 
GOT TO DELIVER CONSUMER BENEFITS OF 
THREE TWENTY FIVE MILLION EVERY YEAR THAT 
COULD BE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF 
STOPPING UNFAIR PRACTICES AND ALSO 
PROMOTING COMPETITION THAT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
MILLION IS NOT AFFECTED BY THE 
FINES THEY ISSUE THOSE FINES GO 
DIRECT TO THE TREASURY STRONG POWERS AND STRONG PENALTIES RACHEL 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOLLOWING THE NEWS THAT RBS ROYAL 
BANK OF SCOTLAND IS OFFERING A 
RIGHTS ISSUE THERE IS NOW TALK TO 
HBOS HALIFAX AND BANK OF SCOTLAND 
IS CONSIDERING A RIGHTS ISSUE 
SHAREHOLDERS GET THESE HUGE AND 
COMPLICATED LETTERS FROM THE 
COMPANIES THEY INVEST IN THEY CAN 
OFFER YOU ALL SORTS OF OPTIONS 
THEY CAN OFFER YOU A TAKEOVER DEAL 
WHEN YOU ARE OFFERED CASH AND 
SHARES IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR OLD 
SHARES THEY CAN OFFER BUY BACKS 
IN WHICH A COMPANY BUYS BACK ITS 
OWN SHARES CONFUSINGLY YOU NEVER 
GET OFFERED YOU ANYTHING THEY BUY 
THE SHARES TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF 
SHARES IN CIRCULATION 
IN SOME SENSES THE FINAL ONE A 
RIGHTS ISSUE IS THE OPPOSITE OF A 
BUYBACK INSTEAD OF REDUCING THE 
AMOUNT OF SHARES A RIGHTS ISSUE 
INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF SHARES THAT 
THERE ARE IN CIRCULATION WHAT ARE 
THEY YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BUY 
SHARES HERE IS OUR BILL OF RIGHTS 
THERE I AM AS GOD KNOWS WHAT I AM 
YOU HAVE A BILL OF RIGHTS YOU HAVE 
A RIGHT TO BUY ONLY IF YOU ALREADY 
OWN SOME SHARES NOT ONLY THAT YOU 
GET THE NEW SHARES AT A DISCOUNT 
IT'S ONE OF THE BIG RIGHTS HERE IT 
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD DEAL 
BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS 
THE PROBLEM FOR SHAREHOLDERS IS IF 
THEY DON'T TAKE UP THEIR RIGHTS 
THE PRICE OF THEIR ECONOMISTING 
SHARES OFTEN FALLS BECAUSE THEY NOW 
OWN A SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THE 
COMPANY COMPANY IF THEY DO TAKE UP THEIR RIGHTS IT 
MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO INVEST MORE 
MONEY MONEY THEY IS DO HAVE A THIRD OPTION 
THAT IS NOT TO BUY THE NEW SHARES 
AT ALL 
BUT TO SELL AND THIS IS CONFUSING 
SOME PEOPLE BUT TO SELL THEIR 
RIGHTS SO SOMEONE ELSE CAN BUY THE 
SHARES AT A DISCOUNT BECAUSE THEY 
OWN THE RIGHT YOU CAN SELL THAT 
RIGHT IT'S WORTH SOMETHING L. L. 
SHOULD SAY THAT HBOS WON'T COMMENT 
ON THE RUMOURS OF A POSSIBLE RIGHTS 
ISSUE THIS IS JUST WIDESPREAD 
RUMOURS THERE IS WIDESPREAD TALK 
IN THE BANKING SECTOR OF MORE 
RIGHTS ISSUE TO COME FROM OTHER 
COMPANIES TOO HBOS ARE HOLDING A 
BOARD MEETING TODAY THEY HAVE AN 
A. G. M. PLANNED FOR TOMORROW WE MAY 
HEAR SOME NEWS ABOUT THAT ISSUE 
THEN HERE ARE SOME OF THE BANK 
SHARES AS I SAID IT'S DIFFICULT 
TO PREDICT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE 
PRICE BUT OFTEN AT LEAST INITIALLY 
SENDS THEM DOWN BECAUSE THERE ARE 
MORE SHARES SO MORE SUPPLY 
INCREASES SUPPLY PUSHES PRICE DOWN 
AS A RULE 
HBOS COMPLETELY UNCHANGED TODAY 
ANNOYINGLY ANNOYINGLY LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HEAR 
ANY NEWS ABOUT THAT 
SEVEN FUEL TANKERS ARE HEADING TO 
SCOTLAND TO ENSURE PETROL 
FORECOURTS DON'T RUN DRY DURING 
THAT STRIKE BY THE WORKERS AT THE 
GRANGEMOUTH OIL REFINERY THE TRADE 
UNIONS SAY THE WORKERS WILL ONLY 
CALL OF THE WALKOUT IF THE OWNERS 
OF THE PLANT INEOS WITHDRAW THEIR 
AUGUST DEADLINE FOR ENDING THEIR 
FINAL SALARY PENSION SCHEME 
ONE OF THE U. K.'S BIGGEST MORTGAGE 
LENDERS HAS INCREASED THE SIZE OF 
THE DEPOSIT IT DEMANDS FROM NEW 
BORROWERS TO AT LEAST TEN PER CENT ON ALL 
BUT TWO OF ITS PRODUCT THE 
NATIONWIDE BUILDING SOCIETY IS 
REDUCING ITS PRODUCT RANGE TO NEW 
BORROWERS EXCEPT ITS THREE YEAR 
FIXED RATE MORTGAGE AND ITS THREE 
YEAR TRADEMARK 
EOS THE 
BUSINESS C. ASS 
ONLY 
AIRLINE THAT FLEW BETWEEN LONDON 
AND NEW YORK HAS FILED FOR 
BANKRUPTCY THE COMPANY IS BLAME 
THE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING ECONOMIC 
ENVIRONMENT FOR THE DECISION 
PEOPLE DUE TO TRAVEL WITH THE 
AIRLINE ARE BEING ADVISED TO CHECK 
IN WITH THEIR TRAVEL AGENTS OR 
CREDIT CARD COMPANIES FOR A REFUND 
THOUSANDS OF HOLIDAYMAKERS COULD BE 
FORCED TO STUMP UP MORE CASH FOR 
THEIR PACKAGE HOLIDAYS BECAUSE OF 
THE STRENGTH OF THE EURO AGAINST 
THE POUND THAT IS ACCORDING TO 
ABTA THE TRAVEL ASSOCIATION THAT 
REPRESENTS TRAVEL AGENTS AND TOUR 
OPERATORS IN THE U. K. TWENTY THREE TOUR 
OPERATORS ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE 
LEVYING A SURCHARGE ON CUSTOMERS 
WHO HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR THEIR 
TICKETS IN FULL BUT WHAT EXACTLY 
ARE YOUR RIGHTS WHEN IT COMES TO 
SUCH SURCHARGES THE PERSON WHO 
KNOWS IS FRANCIS TUKE FROM ABTA 
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE REASONS HEEN 
THESE CHARGES IN A MOMENT WHAT I'M 
KEEN TO GET RIGHT AT THE TOP YOUR 
RIGHTS THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES AND 
REGULATIONS AND PRACTICES ABOUT 
IMPOSING SURCHARGES GIVE US THE 
TOPLINE ON THEM 
THAT'S RIGHT 
EVENTUALLY THE LAWS COME UNDER THE 
PACKAGE TRAVEL REGULATIONS WE ARE 
TALKING JUST ABOUT PACKAGE HOLIDAYS 
HERE HERE WHAT THE PACKAGE TRAVEL REGULATIONS 
SAY IS THAT TOUR OPERATORS HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO SURGEON CHARGE CERTAINLY 
TOUR OPERATORS HAVE TO PUT THAT 
RIGHT WITHIN THEIR TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS AND SAY THEY RESERVE THE 
RIGHT TO SURCHARGE BUT THEY HAVE 
TO ABSORB THE FIRST TWO PER CENT OF THAT 
SURCHARGE ON COST OF THE HOLIDAY 
ABTA HAS ITS OWN RULE WHICH IS 
THAT IF THE SURCHARGE GOES ABOVE 
TEN PER CENT THE TOUR OPERATOR HAS TO OFFER 
THE CUSTOMER A REFUND ON THAT 
HOLIDAY 
THEY'RE BOUND BY THAT HOLIDAY THERE IS ALSO A TIME LIMIT ON HOW 
LONG BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF THAT A 
SURCHARGE CAN BE ADDED 
YOU CAN'T 
IMPOSE A SURCHARGE AFTER 
DAYS OR 
IMPOSE A SURCHARGE AFTER THIRTY DAYS OR AFTER THIRTY DAYS BEFORE DEPARTURE SO 
THE SURCHARGE HAS TO BE IMPOSED 
BEFORE THIRTY DAYS BEFORE DEPARTURE IS IS IT DOWN TO THE STRENGTH OF THE 
EURO HOLIDAYMAKERS ARE BEING HIT 
BY THE STRENGTH OF THE EURO AGAINST 
THE POUND IF THEY ARE HAVING TO 
CHANGE CURRENCY IS IT ABOUT FUEL 
CHARGES 
DO S. 
THAT HAVE TO TO BE 
OPERATED OFF AS A SURCHARGE ABOUT ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE PER CENT OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE ASKED FOR 
ADVICE WITH ABTA ABOUT SURCHARGING 
NOT VERY MANY MEMBERS ARE ASKING 
FOR THIS RIGHT TO SURCHARGE 
TWENTY THREE IS 
A FAIR NUMBER 
OF COURSE IT 
AFFECTS A FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE OUT 
OF FORTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WHO GO ON 
HOLIDAY YOU HAVE TO PUT IT INTO 
PERSPECTIVE HOWEVER CERTAINLY WE 
HAVEN'T SEEN THIS NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
ASKING TO SURCHARGE FOR MANY MANY 
YEARS I THINK PEOPLE KIND OF 
LOOKING BACK TO THE SEVENTIES AND 
EIGHTIES FOR THIS WE JUST HAVEN'T 
SEEN THIS TYPE OF CURRENCY 
FLUCTUATION FOR A LONG TIME WE 
HAVE SEEN THE STERLING DROP BY SEVENTEEN PER CENT PER CENT 
IN JUST A FEW MONTHS THAT HAS HIT 
THE SMALLER INDEPENDENT HOLIDAY 
COMPANIES A LOT HARDER THAN THE 
BIGGER TOUR OPERATORS WHO CAN HEDGE 
FURTHER IN ADVANCE AND PLAY THE 
CURRENCY MARKETS THE SMALLER 
INDEPENDENTS CANNOT DO THAT YOU YOU ARE THERE TO REPRESENT US ALL AND 
TRAVELLERS IF WE ARE UNHAPPY WITH 
THE SURCHARGES AND FEEL THEY'RE 
UNFAIR WHERE DO WE GO YOU YOU CERTAINLY CAN CALL ABTA AND FIND 
OUT WHETHER THE TOUR OPERATORS HAVE 
HAD THEIR SURCHARGES VERIFIED WITH 
US THEY HAVE TO DO THAT AS PART OF 
THEIR CODE OF CONDUCT IF THEY 
HAVEN'T THEN THAT THAT SURCHARGE 
CAN BE INVOKED 
FRANCES TUKE THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH 
YOU CAN SEE SOME ADVICE AND THERE 
ARE LINKS ON OUR OWN WEBSITE AND WE 
WILL GET YOU SOME ANSWERS TO YOUR 
HOLIDAY QUESTIONS WHICH MAY INCLUDE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT SURCHARGES YOU CAN 
HAVE THOSE ANSWERED ON FRIDAY'S 
PROGRAMMES BECAUSE IT IS ON OUR 
CONSUMING ISSUES SLOT SLO GET IN 
TOUCH THERE 
OF WHAT TO 
DO ON THE WORKING LUNCH WEBSITE 
LATER THIS WEEK WE WILL TAKE A 
CLOSE LOOK AT THE DANGER IMPOSED BY 
BOILER ROOMS THESE ARE TEAMS OF 
RICH OFF MERCHANT WHO TARGET 
INVESTORS FROM OVERSEAS AND SELL 
THEM WORTHLESS SHARE SIMON WILL 
EXPLAIN HOW THEY WORK AND HOW TO 
PROTECT YOURSELVES AGAINST THEM 
HOW DO YOU GET HOLD OF INFORMATION 
I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO A DEALER 
WHO HAS BEEN WORKING IN A BOILER 
ROOM IN SPAIN RECENTLY AND HE 
SPILLED THE BEANS ABOUT HOW THEY 
OPERATE I HAVE HERE LOT OF THE 
PAPERWORK THEY MIGHT USE SCRIPTS 
THAT THE SALESMEN USE ON THE 
TELEPHONE HOW TO HOOK YOU THEIR 
REBUTTALS WHEN YOU COME UP WITH 
OBJECTIONS AND LISTS OF NAMES THEY 
GET FROM U. K. SHAREHOLDERS LISTS 
WHICH HAVE NAME TELEPHONE NUMBERS 
EVEN YOUR PERSON INTEREST SO THEY 
CAN HOOK YOU AND WHAT SEEMS TO 
HAPPEN IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF 
BRITISH EXPATS WHO HAVE LEFT SCHOOL 
IN SPAIN FOR IN STANCE LOOKING FOR 
SOMETHING TO DO AND WHAT THIS 
BOILER ROOM DEALER EXPLAINED IS HOW 
THEY GET SUCKED IN FIRST OF ALL 
LET US HAVE PREVIEW LISTEN TO 
HIM WE HAVE DISGUISED HIS IDENTITY 
BERNIE ECCLESTONE PLAINING HOW IT 
HAPPENS 
IT COMES DOWN TO MONEY HAPPENS THEY CAN SEE SOME OF US WALKING 
ROUND WITH TWENTY THOUSAND WATCHING 
EARNING STUPID MONEY 
HOWED BY BIG 
TO THE SALARIES GET 
ONE IS WORTH 
MAYBE FIFTY MILLION SILLY AMENTS OF 
MONEY LAST YEAR I TOOK OVER ONE HUNDRED 
ZERO CASH 
THE POLICE ADD MISTHIS 
IS A PROBLEM THEY ARE TRYING TO 
DEAL WITH IT BUT THE MAIN THING IS 
FOR FOREARMED AND FOREWARNED THAT 
IS WHAT WE WILL HOME IN ON AND IT 
IS PARTICULARLY PERTINENT AT THE 
MOMENT BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS 
THERE HAVE BEEN WITH BANKS AND 
NORTHERN ROCK PEOPLE ARE WORRIED 
ABOUT THEIR INVESTMENT AND THAT 
MAKES THEM A GREATER PREY THEY 
THINK THEY HAVE A OPPORTUNITY TO 
PERSUADE SOMEONE TO INVEST IN 
SOMETHING ELSE BUT THAT MAYBE A RIP 
OFF I KNOW LOTS OF PEOPLE LOST 
THOUSANDS ON THE FULL REPORT IS 
ON 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY THANK ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET US GO ON THE THE 
MARKETS NOW 
MARKETS NOW 
WHITBREAD TO ME 
MARKETS NOW WHITBREAD TO ME CONJURES UP THE IDEA OF BEER THAT 
IS BECAUSE I AM ANCIENT IT IS 
YEARS SINCE THEY HAD ANYTHING TO DO 
WITH ALCOHOL REALLY THE COMPANY 
NOW A RESTAURANT AND HOTELS 
BUSINESS IT REPORTED FULL YEAR 
PRE TAX PROFITS ON THE FACE OF IT 
THEY WERE DOWN SIXTY PER CENT THAT IS BECAUSE 
OF MAJOR COSTS INVOLVED IN 
ACQUISITIONS AND REBRANDING IF YOU 
IGNORE THOSE THE PRE EXCEPTIONAL 
PROFITS WERE BETTER THEN THAT 
TWO HUNDRED TEN POINT THREE MILLION AND THAT IS UP TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE PER CENT 
SO TWO STORIES IT IS COSTING THEM 
A LOT TO INVEST IN THEIR BUSINESS 
BUT THAT IS ONE OFF COST THE 
UNDERLYING BUSINESS DOES SEEM TO BE 
DOING VERY SURPRISINGLY WELL 
PEOPLE EATING OUT AND STAYING IN 
HOTELS IT SEEMS HAVE A LOOK AT THE 
SHARES THIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
TODAY THEY ARE UP ALMOST FOUR PER CENT THERE 
ARE SOME OF THE COMPETITORS THERE 
WHITBREAD HAVE HAD AN AWFUL TIME OF 
IT THIS TIME LAST YEAR THEY WERE 
A LOT HIGHER THAT IS THEM AT THE 
TOP EIGHTEEN OR SO WELL DOWN ON THAT 
THE BEST I CAN SAY IS THAT AT LEAST 
THEY HAVE BEEN MOVING UP MORE 
RECENTLY LET US COMPARE HOW THEY 
HAVE DONE WITH SOME O. OF THEIR 
MAJOR COMPETITORS WHITBREAD HAS 
LOST A THIRD OF ITS VALUE AND 
INTERCONTINENTAL AS LOST ABOUT 
THIRD AS WELL SO THAT DOES REFLECTS 
THE CONCERNS IN THIS AREA 
ELSEWHERE SOME INTERESTING NEWS 
EUROTUNNEL THE COMPANY WHICH 
OPERATES THE RAIL SERVICE BETWEEN 
BRITAIN AND FRANCE HAS ASKED FOR 
SHARES TO BE SUSPENDED PENDING 
STATEMENT WHICH IS GOING TO BE MADE 
LATER TODAY THE SHARES WHICH ARE 
QUOTED IN EUROS HAVE FALLEN OVER 
THE PAST YEAR THEY ARE DOWN ROUND 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE COMPANY 
IS ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE A RIGHTSISH 
SURE WHICH SEEMS TO BE VERY POPULAR 
AT THE MOMENT WE WILL BRING YOU 
THAT NEWS IF WE HEAR ABOUT IT IT 
LOOKS MIXED TODAY SOME ARE UP 
SOME ARE DOWN YOU TAKE YOUR PICK 
BUT NEWS ABOUT THE OFFICE OF FAIR 
TRADING'S INVESTIGATION INTO 
SUPERMARKET PRICING I THOUGHT 
MIGHT HAVE HAD A BIT OF AN EFFECT 
BUT THE MARKET THEY ARE DOWN BUT 
THEY ARE NOT SUBSTANTIALLY DOWN TWO PER CENT 
IN FACT THEY WERE DOING BETTER THAN 
THAT EARLIER ON IN THE DAY THERE 
IS THEIR REACTION THERE ELSEWHERE 
STAGECOACH TRADING HAS BEEN STRONG 
ABOVE EXPECTATION SINCE THE BUS 
AND TRAIN GROUP UPDATED THE MARKET 
IN FEBRUARY ITS SHARES ARE UP TWELVE PER CENT 
THERE AT TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT LET US LOOK AT THE 
F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IT IS UP TWENTY NINE POINTS BUT 
NOW SEEMINGLY COMFORTABLE ABOVE 
SIX THOUSAND NOW IT IS THREE YEARS SINCE 
THE COLLAPSE OF THE ROVER CAR 
COMPANY AND THE CLOSURE OF THAT 
GIANT LONGBRIDGE SITE HAS LEFT 
HOLE IN THE ECONOMY AND MAD HAD A 
MAJOR EFFECT ON THE COMMUNITY ROB 
HAS BEEN TO THE WEST MIDLANDS TO 
FIND OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING THREE 
YEARS 
YEARS ON FOR ALMOST ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
THIS WAS CORNER STOEB OF THE U. K. 
ECONOMY BUT IT WAS A HUGE COMMUNITY 
HUB FOR THOUSANDS WHO DEPEND ON 
THIS FOR WORK NOW IT'S A BUILDING 
SITE BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY PART OF 
AN AMBITIOUS REGENERATION PROGRAMME 
ITS WILL COST SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION AND 
CREATE TEN THOUSAND JOB AND BRING NEW 
LIFE BACK TO LONGBRIDGE THERE WERE 
NINETY NINE YEARS OF CAR BUILDING HERE TO BE 
EXACT BUT WHEN ROVER COLLAPSED ONE 
SHORT OF ITS CENTURY THREE YEARS 
AGO SIX FIVE HUNDRED JOBS DISAPPEARED NOW 
THE SITE IS BUSY AGAIN THIS TIME 
TO THE SOUND OF DIGGERS PREPARING 
THE GROUND FOR REGENERATION LED 
BY THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
AGENCYMENT AGE SI AND THE PROPERTY 
FIRM SAINT MODWEN 
WE ARE LOOKING TO PUT A NEW FOCUS 
BACK INTO LONGBRIDGE THE FACTORY 
WAS THE CENTRE OF THE COMMUNITY AND 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS PLAN IT IS 
INTERESTING YO HAVE A COMMUNITY 
HERE HERE ANOTHER COMMUNITY HERE 
THAT USED TO GET TOGETHER WORK IN 
THE FACTORY SOCIALISE THAT HAS 
GONE ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT 
COME OUT OF THE CONSULTATION WE 
WANT TO CREATE THAT FOCUS HEART OF 
THE AREA 
MIKE MURRAY IS LEADING 
THE RESTORATION THE PLAN IS TO 
BUILD A NEW TOWN CENTRE WITH HOUSES 
PARKS OFFICES FACTORIES AND 
SHOPS 
THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO CREATE SHOPS A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY COMMUNITY IN 
ECONOMIC TRANSPORT PEOPLE WORKING 
WE HAVE A GREAT PIECE OF 
INFRASTRUCTURE HERE THE A THIRTY EIGHT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE 
BUSES AN HOUR RUNNING THROUGH THIS 
JUNCTION 
TWO NEW BUILDS ARE UP JUNCTION THE INNOVATION CENTRE HAS ATTRACTED 
TWENTY FIRMS HERE BRINGS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY JOBS 
SCYRON IS TYPICAL OF THE COMPANIES 
MOVING TO THIS SITE IT SPECIALISES 
IN USING NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR C. C. T. V. 
AND SURVEILLANCE THIS USED TO BE 
THIS MASSIVE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX NOW 
THERE ARE SMALL HI TECH COMPANIES 
LIKE YOU DO YOU THINK IT'S THE WAY 
IT IS GOING 
IT WILL BE A MIX YOU 
COULDN'T FILL A FIVE HUNDRED SITE WITH HI 
TECH COMPANIES BUT YOU NEED A MIX 
OF TECHNOLOGY COMPANY I KNOW THERE 
IS A BIG EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENT 
GOING HERE WHICH WILL BE GREAT FOR 
THE AREA AND THERE IS HOUSING AND 
SHOPS AS WELL AND THAT WAS PART OF 
THE ATTRACTION TO BE IN A VIBRANT 
COMMUNITY NOT STUCK OUT ON A 
BUSINESS PARK ON THE EDGE OF THE 
CITY WHERE THERE WAS NO FACILITIES 
FOR THE STAFF AND IT WASN'T A NICE 
ENVIRONMENT 
THERE COULD EVEN BE ENVIRONMENT CAR MAKING HERE TOO THE COMPANY 
WHICH BOUGHT WROEFR IS PLANNING TO 
BUILD A NEW M. G. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN 
DELAYS AND THE COMPANY WHICH SHOULD 
HAVE MADE THE BODY SHELLS HAVE 
PULLED OUT BUT NANJING SAYS HATE AS 
SUPPLYER AND WILL BE PRODUCE CARS 
BY AUGUST THE DEVELOPMENTS ARE 
BEING FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY FORMING 
ROVER WORKERS SOME ARE SCEPTICAL 
OF THE PROMISES TO BRING S. O. ZERO ZERO ZERO 
JOBS TO THE SITE 
THERE WAS SIX THOUSAND 
JOBS THAT ENDED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND THREE 
YEARS DOWN THE LINE HOW MANY NEW 
JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED WITH THE 
DEVELOPMENT UP THERE IT LOOKS 
GREAT WHERE THE NEW BUILDING HAVE 
GONE UP AND THE TECHNOLOGY CENTRE 
AND SOME OF THOSE BUILDINGS ARE 
OCCUPIED THAT IS GREAT BUT WHERE 
ARE ALL THE NEW JOBS HOW LONG WILL 
IT TAKE TO ESTABLISH THE NEW JOBS 
AND HOW IS THIS THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
AS IT BITES IN NOW GOING TO AFFECT 
THE FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE 
DEVELOPMENT GOING ON UP HERE FOR 
NEW JOBS 
I THINK IT IS REALISTIC 
YOU LOOK AT LONG BRING FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY ACRE 
SITE WHEN YOU LOOK T. T. DIVERSITY OF 
JOBS WE ARE LOOKING TO BRING WE 
CAN DO THAT OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS 
OF THE PROJECT 
HAVE YOU GOT PEOPLE 
TO MOVE IN GIVEN THE ECONOMY IS 
NOT DOING WELL 
WE HAVE SEEN IT 
ALREADY WE HAVE BEEN TO THE 
INMOWISATION CENTRE WE HAVE OTHER 
COMPANY THEY ARE COMING HERE 
BECAUSE THERE IS A DIVERSE SKILLS 
BASE YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD LOCATION 
NOT FAR FROM THE CITY CLOSE TO THE 
MOTORWAY NETWORK AND PEOPLE ARE 
BEGINNING TO SEE LONGBRIDGE AS A 
PLACE TO BE 
MEANWHILE THE PACE IS 
INCREASING AS BUILDINGS ARE KNOCKED 
DOWN AND THE SITE CLEARED A RIVER 
THAT HAS LONG BEEN BURIED BENEATH 
THE FACTORY IS TO BE RESURRECTED 
THERE ARE WILL BE PARKS FOOTPATHS 
AND HOMES AS PART OF A PLAN TO 
BRING LIFE BACK TO LONGBRIDGE AS 
WELL AS JOBS IT WILL BE FIFTEEN YEARS 
BEFORE THIS PROJECT IS COMPLETED 
ALTHOUGH WITHIN ABOUT THREE YEARS 
THIS SITE WILL BE READY AND A NEW 
COLLEGE WILL BE BUILT HERE TOO SO 
MUCH FOR THE LAND AND THE BUILDINGS 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO USED 
TO RELY ON LONG BRIDGE FOR THEIR 
LIVELIHOOD TOMORROW I WILL SPEAK 
TO THEM IF YOU CAN'T WAIT UNTIL 
TOMORROW YOU CAN GO TO THE WEBSITE 
WHERE YOU CAN READ ABOUT ROB 
CATCHING UP WITH SOME FORMER 
LONGBRIDGE WORKERS THERE IS THE 
ADDRESS I HOPE YOU WILL AGREE 
DURING THE CULTURE SHOW E. CREDIT 
CRUNCH WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 
BALANCE THINGS OUT ABOUT HOW YOU 
CAN MAKE MONEY IN A SO CALLED 
RECESSION HOW DO YOU MEET THE BIG 
CHALLENGES IN BUSINESS THE SECRET 
MIGHT BE TO FLIP YOUR STRATEGY ON 
ITS HEAD THAT IS ACCORDING TO 
PETER SHEAHAN WHO LATEST BOOK IS 
CALLED FLIP YOU KIND OF GIVE IT IT 
WAY IN THE TITLE WHAT IS FLIP L. 
PRESUME YOU ARE TURNING IDEAS ON 
THEIR HEADS 
TAKING THE APPROACH TO 
AN EXISTING MARKET IF YOU THINK 
ABOUT SONY VERSUS MICROSOFT THEY 
ARE TRYING TO MAKE FASTER PROCESSES 
BETTER GRAPHICSER MORE 
SOPHISTICATED CUSTOMERS NINTENDO 
HAVE A LESS SOPHISTICATED AUDIENCE 
AND THEY HAVE SOLD TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO 
DATE EXPECT TO SELL ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE 
MILLION IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS 
THASHES THAT IS A FLIP 
YOUR BOOK 
IS REALLY A GUIDE FOR MANAGERERS 
ABOUT HOW BETTER TO STRUCTURE 
BUSINESS I WONDER NOW WE ARE 
FACING A CREDIT CRUNCH WHEN YOU 
THINK A DIFFERENT SORT OF MANAGER 
DOES BETTER 
IF YOU HAVEN'T MADE 
MONEY IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS YOU 
ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG 
YOU ARE 
PROBABLY OUT OF BUSINESS 
TAKING A 
R. I. S. WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD IS EASY IT 
IS WHEN YOUR BACK IS TO THE WALL IT 
IS MORE CHARGING IN A RESWHRETION 
WE HAVE TALKED OURSELF INTO IT OR 
NOT IS THE TIME TO FLIP WHILE 
EVERYBODY IS PULLING BACK WHAT CAN 
WE DO TO GET OURSELF ON THE FRONT 
FOOT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL 
MARKETS MOST OF THE INVESTMENT 
BANKS ARE LAYING PEOPLE OFF 
GOLDMAN SACHS ARE PUSHING FORWARD 
SO COME THE NEXT UP SWING WE WILL 
KNOW WHO WILL BE AT THE FRONT WE WE HAVE PULLED SOUTH SOME O. YOUR 
THEMES AND THE FIRST IS ACTION 
CREATES CLARITY IT IS LETTING YOUR 
HEART RULE INSTEAD OF THE HEAD IT IT IS ARROGANT TO ASSUME WE HAVE ANY 
REAL IDEA WHAT IS GOING TO HALF 
THREE TO FIVE YEARS OUT WE CAN DO 
ANALYSIS GET EXPERTISE BUT AT SOME 
LEVEL WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE DECISION 
ON AMBIGUOUS INFORMATION AND WHAT I 
BELIEVE IS THE DECISION ITSELF AND 
THE ACTION THAT FOLLOWS IT CREATES 
THE CLARITY YOU NIED TO KNOW 
WHETHER IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION 
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE WE MAKE AS 
MANAGERS IN BIGGER ORGANISATIONS 
IS WE KEEP WAITING FOR PERFECT 
INFORMATION TO MAKE THE RIGHT 
DECISION MEANWHILE REALLY 
ENTREPRENEUR YAL THINKERS IN A 
COMPANY ARE MAKING THE DECISION 
ANY WAY AND THEY GETTING THE 
CLARITY FROM THE ACTION THEY ARE 
TAKING 
BUT ISN'T 
THAT SUGGESTING TAKING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD ACT BEFORE THEY 
KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DO SOMETHING 
ISN'T THAT WHAT WE DO ANY WAY I I THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING CLEARLY 
THAT IS THING WE PUT OUT AN AURA 
WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING THIS IS 
WHAT LED TO THE PUBLICATION OF FLIP 
MY COMPANY WAS WORKING WITH 
ORGANISATIONS ON BIG ROUND WORK 
FORCE TRENDS AND TALENT SHIFTS AND 
I WAS SURPRISE TO SEE SENIOR 
MANAGERS THROWING MUD AT WALL AND 
HOPING IT STICKS FLIP IS MEANT TO 
SAY THAT IS O. K. YES YOU NEED TO DO 
DUE DILIGENCE AND RESEARCH BUT I AT 
SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO MAKE DITION 
WHERE THE INFORMATION IS SPOT ON 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN 
THE OTHER THING PEOPLE SAY HAPPEN IT IS NOT PERSONAL IT IS BUSINESS 
YOU FLIP IT AN YOU SAY BUSINESS IS 
PERSONAL AND THIS FASCINATES ME 
NO MATTER WHAT TECHIE YOU HAVE GOT 
GETTING IN FRONT OF PEOPLE AND 
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AND 
LIKING YOU YOU SAY LEADS TO 
BETTER BUSINESS 
WE DO BUSINESS 
WITH PEOPLE WE KNOW LIKE AND 
FOUNDATION TRUST THE FLIP IS THE 
TECHNOLOGY IF USED PROPERLY CAN BE 
A GREAT WAY TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS 
LET US TAKE CALL CENTRE 
RESPONSIBILITY THE DECISION WE 
HAVE MADE IS PARTICULARLY BIG 
ORGANISATION IS TAKE THE PART OF 
THE BUSINESS THAT TOUCHES THE 
CONSUMER THE BUSINESS THAT HAS THE 
RELATIONSHIP AND SEND THAT OFF 
OVERSEA WE SHOULD HAVE DONE WAS 
KEEP THAT HERE ON BRITISH SOIL ON 
AMERICAN SOIL ON AUSTRALIAN SOIL 
AND OUTSOURCE RISKS SO THE STORY 
YOU RAN T. THE TOP OF THE SHOW 
SUPERMARKET 
WE HAVE TEN SECONDS SUPERMARKET TO TELL YOU 
CORRECT WITH THE 
CUSTOMER 
WE COULD CALL ALL CUSTOMER AFTERNOON AND EVENING SEE YOU
