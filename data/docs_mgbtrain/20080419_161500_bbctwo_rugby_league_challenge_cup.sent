CASTLEFORD WERE THE NEW KIDS ON THE 
SUPER LEAGUE BLOCK THIS SEASON HOW 
HAS IT BEEN GOING FOR THEM 
IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH SEASON SO FAR 
FOR THE TIGERS TERRY MATTERSON'S 
TEAM LED ON THE OPENING DAY THREE 
TRIES FROM STUART DONLAN AND 
MICHAEL SHENTON BUT THEY FELT AWAY 
IN THE SECOND HALF FELT A WAVE 
AN EARLY JOE WESTERMAN TRY AND TWO 
SCORES FROM SHENTON IT STARTED THE 
SECOND HALF AGAINST LEEDS AND SET 
THEM ON THE COURSE FOR A SHOCK 
VICTORY THEY CLAIMED ANOTHER 
NOTABLE SCALP EARLIER THIS MONTH 
BEATING SAINT HELENS THEY COME INTO 
TODAY'S GAME ON THE BACK OF A HEAVY 
HOME DEFEAT THE PLAYERS HAVE BEEN 
GROWING BID IT GROWING BEARDS AS 
PART OF A COMPETITION TO BOOST 
MORALE MORALE EXPLAIN THIS TO ME AS A COACH HOW 
CAN SIDE BE GOOD ENOUGH TO BEAT 
LEEDS AND SAINT HELENS AND GET BEATEN 
BY EVERYBODY ELSE 
THEY HAVE BEEN 
CLOSE IN A LOT OF OTHER GAMES WHEN 
WE PLAYED THEM THERE WERE ONLY 
FOUR OR SIX POINTS IN THEM BEFORE 
WE MOVED AWAY THEY HAVE COMPETED 
FOR LONG PERIODS ARE IN GAMES 
SOMETIMES IT IS THE SMALL THINGS 
THAT GET YOU BEATEN IN THE BIG 
GAMES THE EMOTIONAL LEVELS WERE 
REALLY HIGH AGAINST SAINT HELENS 
THEY CERTAINLY GOT THE BOUNCE OF 
THE BALL RIGHT AT THE END TO WIN 
IT IS THE LEARNING PROCESS OF BEING 
BACK IN THE SUPERLEAGUE YOU HAVE 
TO PERFORM EVERY WEEK THERE IS A 
LOT OF YOUNG TALENT THAT HAS TO 
LEARN THOSE RULES 
THAT IS THE BIG 
GULF IT IS TOUGHER IN THE 
SUPERLEAGUE 
IT IS ABOUT GETTING SUPERLEAGUE USED TO THE CONSISTENCY OF THAT 
LEVEL OF COMPETITION IT IS A BIG 
CHALLENGE FOR US TOMORROW WE 
PLAYED IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE 
COMPETITION AND PLAY A SUPER LEAGUE 
TEAM TOMORROW IT IS ABOUT GETTING 
USED TO THE QUALITY OF COMPETITION 
AT BEING ABLE TO COMPETE 
CONSISTENTLY 
WHERE DOES THE CONSISTENTLY CHALLENGE CUP FEATURE FOR TEAMS 
THIS YEAR HOW IMPORTANT IS AT TWO 
COACHES 
THEY ARE ONLY TWO TROPHIES COACHES AND YOU WANT ONE OF THEM YOU NEED 
TO BE IN THE BATTLE AND GO AS FAR 
AS YOU CAN IN BOTH COMPETITIONS 
THE HISTORY AND THE ESTEEM THAT 
GOES WITH THE CHALLENGE CUP IS 
SECOND TO NONE EVERYONE WANTS TO 
PERFORM AND PLAY IN IT YOU ONLY 
GET TWO BITES OF THE CHERRY AND 
THIS IS ONE OF THEM 
AS A PLAYER 
IT IS PARTICULARLY SPECIAL TO YOU 
ROBBIE YOU HAVE LIFTED THIS TROPHY 
A I HAVE AND IT IS WONDERFUL THIS 
TOURNAMENT IS ALL ABOUT WINNING IT 
IS ABOUT WINNING ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH TO THE FINAL AND PICKING UP 
THAT SILVERWARE AT THE END OF THE 
FINAL IT IS NOT A COMPETITION FOR 
LOSERS YOU GET FORGOTTEN ABOUT 
YOU NEVER KNOW WITH A BIT OF LUCK 
AND HARD WORK I COULD DO IT WITH 
SALFORD AS WELL 
A BIT OF 
INSPIRATION IS IMPORTANT AS WELL 
TERRY MATTERSON IS MAN WHO PLAYED 
FOR LONDON BRONCOS IN THE FIRST 
THREE YEARS OF SUPER LEAGUE NOW HE 
IS PLOTTING THEIR DOWNFALL THE 
CASTLE FEEL CASTLEFORD COACH HAS 
BEEN TALKING TO US 
I THINK IT IS A GREAT TIME THE WAY 
THEY HAVE BEEN PLAYING SHOWS THAT 
IF YOU DON'T TURN UP YOU WILL NOT 
BE THEM IT IS A CHALLENGE FOR US 
WE GOT CLOSE TO THEM A FEW WEEKS 
AGO ANY DANGER MEN THAT YOU ARE 
LOOKING FOR IN THEIR SIDE THEY 
PLAY REALLY WELL AS A TEAM DANNY 
ORR IS CERTAINLY GOING TO HAVE TO 
BE WATCHED 
WHAT HAS GONE WRONG 
WITH CASTLEFORD IN THE SUPER 
LEAGUE 
IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE LEAGUE TOUGH WE HAVE BEEN THERE OR 
THEREABOUTS IN THE MAJORITY OF 
GAMES WE HAVE LOST TWO OR THREE IN 
THE LAST FEW MINUTES WE HAVE TO 
TURN THOSE AROUND INTO WINS WE 
HAVE HAD TO GREAT WINS AGAINST 
LEEDS AND SAINT HELENS WE ARE LOOKING 
FOR MORE CONSISTENCY WE KNEW IT 
WOULD BE TOUGH 
THERE IS A LOT OF 
FACIAL HAIR AROUND YOUR CAMP THE THE BOYS GET A BIT BORED SO THEY CAME 
UP WITH A BIT OF A BED 
NOT TEMPTED 
TO JOIN THEM 
I AM LACKING HAIR IN 
SOME AREAS AND THAT IS NOT WHERE I 
WANT TO PUT ANY HAIR ON 
BEST OF 
LUCK LUCK AND IT IS AN INTERESTING THING TO 
DO APPARENTLY DWAIN CHAMBERS ONLY 
NEEDS TO SHAVE ONCE A WEEK SO IT 
MIGHT TAKING A WHILE TO GROW SUCH A 
BID HE IS IN THE DRESSING ROOM 
HELPING OUT WHAT IS YOUR ATTITUDE 
TO THE SIGNING OF HIM 
HE IS 
BACKING HIMSELF HE HAS NOT DONE IT 
FOR PUBLICITY IT IS A RUTHLESS 
BRUTAL GAME YOU WILL GET HURT IF 
YOU DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY 
EVERYBODY DESERVES AN OPPORTUNITY 
GIVE THE GUY A GO IT IS A TOUGH 
TASK IT IS A HARD PLACE TO PLAY 
RUGBY LEAGUE ON THE WINGS HE WILL 
GO THROUGH A BAPTISM OF FIRE NEXT 
WEEK HE HAS NOT SHIRKED OR SAID 
ANYTHING NEGATIVE HE HAS GIVEN 
HIMSELF A CHANCE 
DO YOU FIND IT IN 
ANY WAY INSULTING THAT SOMEBODY 
MIGHT THINK BECAUSE THEY CAN RUN 
TWO HUNDRED METRES REALLY FAST THEY CAN 
PLAY A GAME AS COMPLICATED AS THIS 
I DON'T KNOW L. HAVE MADE A CAREER 
OUT OF RUNNING AWAY FROM THE BIG 
BOYS IT IS SKILL YOU NEED TO 
HAVE IF YOU ARE QUICK AND YOU CAN 
RUN QUICKLY ON THE GRASS AND GET 
INTO SPACE THAT IS WHAT HE WILL 
BE HOPING TO DO AM SURE THERE 
ARE LOT OF FORWARDS WHO WOULD 
LIKE TO GET THEIR HANDS ON SOMEONE 
THAT HIGH PROFILE 
WE WILL HEAR 
FROM DWAIN CHAMBERS AND FIND OUT 
WHETHER HE'S ENJOYING IT AT HALF 
TIME WHAT OF HARLEQUINS IT HAS 
BEEN AN IN AND OUT SEASON FOR THEM 
SO FAR THE AFTER LOSING TO WIGAN 
ON THE OPENING DAY OF THE SEASON 
QUINS COACH BRIAN MCDERMOTT SAW HIS 
TEAM ONE WIN IN THEIR NEXT FOUR 
MATCHES MATCHES THEY WON TWENTY TWO TO SIXTEEN AT CASTLEFORD THEN 
LET A DRUBBING AND HUDDERSFIELD PUT 
THEM TOP OF THE TABLE THEIR FORM 
HAS SLIPPED SINCE THEN AND THEY 
HAVE LOST FOUR OF THEIR LAST SIX 
GAMES INCLUDING A FIFTY EIGHT TO TWELVE 
THRASHING AT SAINT HELENS LAST WEEK 
QUINS HAD NO ANSWER TO THE POWER 
AND PACE OF THE SAINTS SAINT HELENS 
RAN IN TEN TRIES PLENTY FOR BRIAN 
MCDERMOTT TO PONDER IT HARLEQUINS 
ARE ONE OF FOUR TEAMS CURRENTLY ON 
EIGHTY EIGHT TWELVE POINTS 
WE COULD HAVE A VERY LEAKY MATCH 
LETS HEAR FROM THE HARLEQUINS COACH 
YOU HAVE BEATEN CASTLEFORD IN THE 
SUPER LEAGUE THIS SEASON ALREADY 
HOW DO YOU BEAT THEM AGAIN TODAY 
IT WAS A PRETTY TIGHT GAME FOR A 
LONG PERIOD AGAINST CASTLEFORD LAST 
TIME WE PLAYED L. ENVISAGE 
SOMETHING SIMILAR TODAY 
HENRY PAUL 
HAS BEEN A REVELATION THIS SEASON 
WHAT IS HIS SECRET HE IS GETTING 
ON A BIT 
HE WAS A REVELATION LAST 
SEASON HENRY JUST WORKS HARD IN 
EVERY SESSION HE DOES HE COMES IN 
THE FIRST OR SECOND HE IS AS 
COMMITTED AS EVER IT IS JUST HARD 
WORK 
YOU HAVE PINPOINTED RYAN WORK MCGOLDRICK ON THEIR SIDE 
MCGOLDRICK IS GOOD PLAYER A VERY 
DANGEROUS PLAYER WHEN HE IS GOOD 
EVEN THE BEST DEFENCES WILL 
STRUGGLE THERE ARE ALSO SOME OTHER 
INDIVIDUALS YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE 
OF WE WOULD DO JOB ON RYAN 
MCGOLDRICK AND IT WOULD MAKE 
CASTLEFORD AND EASIER TEAM TO PLAY 
AGAINST 
HARLEQUINS HAVE HAD A AGAINST DECENT RECORD IN THE CHALLENGE CUP 
WHAT WOULD IT DO FOR RUGBY LEAGUE 
IN THE CITY OF LONDON IF YOU HAD A 
GOOD RUN AND PERHAPS EVEN ONE IT IT WOULD BE MASSIVE FOR THE GAME IN 
GENERAL WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO GET 
THERE ANY MORE THAN ANY OTHER TEAM 
IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF HARD WORK 
THERE ARE A LOT OF OBSTACLES TO GO 
BEFORE WE GET EXCITED THIS IS THE 
FIRST ROUND AND WE ARE UP AGAINST A 
VERY CAPABLE TEAM 
A RYAN 
MCGOLDRICK START FROM THE BENCH 
THERE IS A MAN WITH A SUPERLATIVE 
RECORD IN CHALLENGE CUP HISTORY 
SHAUN EDWARDS HAS LIFTED THE CUP 
NINE TIMES HE IS NOW THE DEFENCE 
CUP WITH WALES HE HAS WON A GRAND 
SLAM WITH THEM YOU WOULD WANT HIS 
ADVICE IF YOU COULD GET IT LET'S 
HAVE A LOOK AT THE PLAYERS WHO HAD 
BEEN TALKED ABOUT WE CAN START 
WITH HENRY PAUL YOUR BROTHER HE 
SEEMS TO BE MAKING MORE TACKLES 
THAN EVER BEFORE IS HE WORKING 
HARDER 
HE IS HE HAD A GREAT PRE HARDER SEASON HE IS LOOKING REALLY TRIM 
AND FIT HE SAID HE HAD BEEN DOING 
A LOT OF WORK ON HIS OWN AS WELL AS 
WITH THE TEAM HE IS KNOCKING ON A 
BIT BUT HE HAS REALLY TURNED BACK 
TIME HIS WORKLOAD HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
A REALLY HIGH HE HAS ALWAYS 
TRAINED WELL 
HE IS OLDER THAN YOU 
ISN'T HE 
HE IS TWO YEARS OLDER 
THAN ME L. GET VERY DISTRESSED WHEN 
PEOPLE THINK I AM OLDER THAN HIM 
THAT'S WHERE I THOUGHT I SHOULD 
MAKE IT CLEAR HE COULD BE A BIG 
THREAT TODAY 
HE HAS BEEN PLAYING 
REALLY WELL IT IS TESTAMENT TO HOW 
HE APPLIES HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE 
GAME WHEN BOBBY AND HENRY WERE 
TOGETHER AT BRADFORD THEY WERE AN 
AWESOME COMBINATION ROBBIE HE 
HAS BEEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN 
EVERYTHING HE HAS TOUCHED IT IS 
DOWN TO DEDICATION HE IS A LEADER 
IN THAT TEAM HE HAS BEEN THERE AND 
DONE THAT AND WILL GET THE YOUNGER 
BLOKES GOING 
AND CHAD RANDALL WHAT DOES HE 
BRING TO THE HARLEQUINS 
HE IS THE 
HOOKER HE IS THE MAN THEY ARE ALL 
LISTENING TO HE FINDS HOLES IN AND 
AROUND AND GET PEOPLE ON THE FRONT 
FOOT WHICH MEANS THEY CAN PLAY 
QUICKER OPPORTUNITIES OPEN UP 
HE'S MAKING SO MANY GOOD DECISIONS 
AS A LEADER HE IS A MODEL IS HE 
I'M SHORT TO BE MODEL HE IS 
TALLER THAN I AM HE IS ABLE TO 
TURN AND GET OUT AND KICK THE BALL 
LONG 
LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE GETTING LONG THEIR LAST FEW SIPS OF WATER AND 
WILL GO WILL BE COMING OUT 
SHORTLY 
CASTLEFORD ARE IN YELLOW SHORTLY AND BLACK 
BRIAN SHERWIN HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN 
TO GET THE CASTLEFORD TEAM AROUND 
THE FIELD THERE'S LITTLE KICKS 
GIVE YOU WINNING SCORES AND KEEP 
THEM OUT OF TROUBLE HE PUSHES INTO 
HOLES ON THE BACK OF THE FORWARDS 
AND THE BRANCH OF FORWARDS LOOK 
LIKE A BUNCH OF RUSSIAN BEARS AT 
THE MOMENT WITH THOSE BEARDS HE 
WILL LISTEN AND THEY WILL LISTEN TO 
HIS VOICE 
HARLEQUINS ARE 
FAVOURITES CAN CASTLEFORD BEAT 
THEM 
ABSOLUTELY IT IS AN EVEN THEM MATCH CAST CAN BEAT THEM IT IS 
GOING TO BE TOUGH 
THEY NEED TO 
COME OUT HERE SCORE SOME POINTS 
AND CONTINUED TO KEEP PONDERING YET 
IF HARLEQUINS KEEP ON GETTING 
SCORES THEY WILL GO AWAY 
IN OUR 
COMMENTARY BOX WE HAVE JONATHAN 
DAVIS AND RAY FRENCH 
WE COULDN'T HAVE A MORE EVENLY 
BALANCED TIE BETWEEN TWO TEAMS THAN 
THIS ONE HARLEQUINS IN THOSE 
FAMOUS COLOURS OF SKY BLUE 
CHOCOLATE BRAND MAGENTA AND FRENCH 
GRAVE THE HARLEQUINS SIDE THEY 
RELY ON HENRY PAUL AND DANNY ORR OR 
IN BACK CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN 
THAT QUINS PACK TEN MATTER RANDALL 
AND WARD AND INEXPERIENCE 
CASTLEFORD THREE QUARTER LINE IN 
BRENT SHERWIN THEY HAVE THE MAN TO 
BRING THE BEST OUT OF THOSE 
YOUNGSTERS IN THE PACK ANDREW 
HENDERSON WILL SURELY MAKE MOST OF 
THE PLAY KNOCKOUT FOR BIG POWERFUL 
MICHAEL KORKIDAS LOOKOUT THOSE 
REPLACEMENTS COULD PLAY GREATER 
PART IN THIS GAME IF WE MOVE INTO 
EXTRA TIME THREE CHANGES WILL BE 
ALLOWED IF WE HAVE DRAW AT FULL 
TIME EXCELLENT CONDITION FOR THE 
PITCH READY TO GET UNDER WAY 
LIGHT RAIN COMING DOWN THE FLOOD 
LIGHTS FLOOD LIGHTS ARE ON 
IT IS 
A BIT MISERABLE NOT MUCH RAIN L. 
DON'T THINK IT WILL AFFECT 
MUCH OF 
THE HANDLING LONDON RUGBY LEAGUE REALLY BRIMMING WITH LOTS OF SCHOOLS PLAYING THEY COULD TO CHASE GOOD CHASE A 
GOOD KICK THEY WILL BE HAPPY 
KEEPING SOLID KEEP IT SOLID IT ROLLED UP THE CHEST DON'T THINK 
THERE WAS ANYTHING MALICIOUS IN 
THAT THE REFEREE IS SETTING HIS 
STALL OUT EASY EARLY YOU'LL NOTICE A LOT OF THESE BITS 
THAT THE CASTLEFORD PLAYERS ARE 
WEARING THEY LOOK LIKE THE DUTCH 
RENAISSANCE MASTERS JUST THE WRONG WAY JUST DIDN'T GET 
THERE HE IS THE ONE THAT WILL CALL 
THE SHOTS TODAY BRENT SHERWIN 
VERY CLEVER FOOTBALLER CLEVER 
KICKING GAME A NUMBER OF CASTLEFORD PLAYERS 
TAKING COULD ADVANTAGE OF SOME 
MARKETING COULD ADVANTAGE JON WELLS ONE OF CASTLEFORD'S FORMER PLAYERS I THINK HENRY PAUL FELT THERE WAS A 
NEVER SIX TACKLES THROUGH THERE 
THE WORKED ON THE SHORT SIDE AND 
SHERWIN JUST PULLED AWAY MADE THE 
CRUCIAL TACKLE 
CASTLEFORD UNDER 
PRESSURE THERE WAS A KNOCK DOWN 
DEFINITELY HE HAD TO MAKE A TACKLE 
VERY GOOD PLAY FROM SHOWING THAT THAT IS A CLEVER FOOTBALLER THAT 
BRITAIN'S TO PUT THE ON DOWN AND 
KNOCKS IT DOWN AT THE SAME TIME THAT LITTLE KICK THIS TIME FINDING TOUCH IT KEEPS MOMENTUM GOING HENRY PAUL STILL ARGUING WITH THE 
RICHARD SILVERWOOD 
I THINK THERE 
IS A PROBLEM WITH THE TOUCH JUDGE 
HE CAN'T HEAR ONE OF THE TOUCH 
JUDGES 
OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM WITH JUDGES THE INTERCOM GONE EX DIRECTORY FOR 
A LITTLE WHILE I THINK THE TOUCH 
JUDGE REALISED HE HAD KNOCKED THE 
BALL DOWN BUT COULDN'T GET IN TOUCH 
WITH THE REFEREE ALL WALKIE TALKIE 
THESE DAYS THE COACH HAS TALKED 
DOWN TO THE MASSEURS THEY'VE RUN 
ON WITH WATER BOTTLES AND OTHER 
PLAYERS WHAT TO DO REFEREES ARE 
OFTEN TOLD WHAT TO DO 
AS THEY 
OFFLOAD KEEP IT GOING THERE HENRY 
PAUL SPOTS THIS SHORT SIDE IF WE 
STOP IT THERE THERE ARE ONLY TWO 
DEFENDERS THERE BUT CLEVER PLAY BY 
SHERWIN HE BACKS OFF THEN 
RUSSIA'S HIM HE CUTS THE THREE ON 
TWO OUT THE PLAYER STILL WAITING FOR THE RADIO SYSTEM TO BE FIXED THE ONE THING YOU HAVE TO WORK ON 
IT IS GREAT THE KICK TO TOUCH BUT 
THE UP AND UNDER TO TRY AND GAIN 
POSSESSION PUT THEM UNDER PRESSURE HENRY PAUL DIRECTING OPERATIONS FOR HARLEQUINS GOING FORWARD A GOOD TACKLE HE TRIED TO AVOID GOING BEHIND HIM 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY A GOOD BALANCE 
BY DANNY ORR HE HAS BEEN INFORMED DANNY ORR 
ONE OR TWO TALKING ABOUT 
REINSTATEMENT INTO THE 
INTERNATIONAL SIDE JUST TWO CAPS 
TO HIS CREDIT YOU CAN SEE THAT TRIANGLE WORKING OF DANNY ORR PAUL AND THE HOOKER KORKIDAS BIG AND POWERFUL THAT WAS A GOOD CATCH WELL TAKEN THE CHALLENGER TOOK A KNOCK BUT I 
DON'T THINK HE WILL BE TOO BOTHERED 
ABOUT THAT 
NOT SQUARE MADE THE 
TACKLE I THINK IT WAS KORKIDAS 
THAT GOT HIM BY THE COLLAR GOOD KICK STILL HARLEQUINS ZERO CASTLEFORD ZERO GOOD DRIVING FROM THIS CASTLEFORD PACK MAKING THREE OR FOUR METRES PER FOR OFFLOADING 
HE HAS TAKEN THE BALL OFFLOADING STRONGLY 
A BIT OF A 
DEBATE STRONGLY DEBATE ABOUT WEDDING TO GO WHETHER TO GO WAS HE OFFSIDE WAS HE STANDING 
BEHIND THAT LINE 
WELL READ BY 
HENDERSON SPOTTED THE PAST I BET HE COULD BEAT DWAIN CHAMBERS OVER TEN METRES IF HE WASN'T OFFSIDE HE HAS LOST ITS KNOCK ON ONE ON ONE YES HE LOST IT THE SCRUM HAS GONE 
TO HARLEQUINS 
HE HAS GIVEN THE 
KNOCK ON I THOUGHT HE'D LOST IT 
TO BE QUITE HONEST MICHAEL WORRINCY ANOTHER LAD WHO 
HAS COME THROUGH THE ACADEMY SYSTEM 
MBU DID VERY WELL TO PICK THAT BALL 
UP 
THAT IS PAUL FROM WORRINCY GOT UP TO CONCENTRATE AT THE PLAY OF THE 
BALL DEFINITELY DROPPED THE BALL 
THERE 
THERE WAS NO PRESSURE ON HIM THERE NONE AT ALL 
THIS IS THE FIRST LINE 
FOR CASTLEFORD TIGERS FIRST TIME 
HARLEQUINS FOR ALL THE PRESSURE 
FIFTY PER CENT COMPLETION RATE OF THE SET OF 
SIXES I DON'T THINK THEY WILL BE 
TOO KEEN ON THAT 
MOST OF THEIR 
SETS HAVE BEEN IN THEIR OWN HALF CRAIG HUBY ONE OF THE BEARDED BRIGADE IT GOES DEAD JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO 
FAR TOO MUCH ON IT VERY CLEVER 
PLAY THE DUMMY RUNNER JUST HELD UP 
DANNY OFF FOR THAT SECOND DANNY 
OFF AT THE MOMENT DEFENCES ARE DOMINATING MCDERMOTT WILL NOT BE HAPPY 
HARLEQUINS JUST NEED TO RUN THROUGH 
A SET OF SIX JUST TO GET 
CONFIDENCE IN HANDLING THE BALL 
THEY ARE LETTING IT GO ALL THE TIME KORKIDAS GOOD POWERFUL BURST IT 
TAKES TWO OR THREE MEN TO PULL HIM 
DOWN EVERY TIME MAYBE NOT 
THE BRIGHTEST PLAYER ON THE LAST TACKLE CLAYTON JUST TOOK THE BALL INTO TWO DEFENDERS HE HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE JUST HANDED IT 
OVER 
THIS IS WHERE CASTLEFORD HAVE OVER GOT TO WORK 
CAN HARLEQUINS HOLD TO 
THIS BALL BORY SET OF SIX THEY 
NEED TO FORTY PER CENT COMPLETION FOR THE HOME SIDE THIS IS BETTER FROM HARLEQUINS 
THEY MADE A GOOD THIRTY METRES IN THAT 
SEQUENCE I AM WITH THE CARS OF THE TEAM 
MANAGER SIGNS THAT THEY ARE 
GETTING BUT IN THE DOOR 
CASTLEFORD THE TEAM MANAGER WE ARE 
BEFORE AMONG ALL RIGHT AT THE 
MOMENT A BIT OF LIGHT RAIN IT IS 
A BIT STICKY OUT THERE 
WE ARE 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SUMMER BUT 
AT THE MOMENT WE ARE GOING O. K. GOOD DECISION THERE HE KEEPS 
KICKING DOWN TO TONY CLUBB BUT 
TONY CLUBB HAS BEEN ADEQUATE IN 
EVERYONE 
IF YOU PUT 
THE BALL IN EVERYONE THE AIR WITH A SWIRLING WIND AND 
LIGHT DRIZZLE QUESTIONS WILL BE 
ASKED 
CASTLEFORD HAVE HAD JUST TWO ASKED WINS RECENTLY BUT WHAT WINS ONE 
AGAINST LEEDS AND WON AGAINST THE 
CURRENT CHALLENGE CUP HOLDERS SAINT 
HELENS NO ONE ELSE IN THE SUPER 
LEAGUE HAS DONE THAT WHATEVER 
THEIR POSITION THEY CAN BEAT THE 
BEST 
THAT WAS A GOOD CHASER A BEST VERY GOOD CHASE CRAIG HUBY WAS 
THERE AND SPOTTED THE KICKER IT 
WAS NOT THE BEST KICK FROM DANNY 
OFF 
HARLEQUINS MAY HAVE DROPPED OFF THE BALL BUT I CAN'T THINK OF THEM 
MISSING A TACKLE IN SIXTEEN MINUTES 
THEY ARE THE DOMINANT SIDE AT THE 
MOMENT IN FIELD POSITION THERE 
WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH 
THEIR COMPLETION RATE KNOCK ONS 
UNFORCED ERRORS CASTLEFORD STILL TRYING TO MOVE 
THE BALL OUT WIDE DESPITE THE 
WEATHER A STRONG WIND BLOWING 
AROUND THE TWICKENHAM STOOP AS WELL 
AS THE HAZARD OF THE RAIN JON 
WELLS GETTING A HOSTILE RECEPTION 
FROM SOME OF HIS OLD COLLEAGUES THERE IS DWAIN CHAMBERS THE MAN 
ABOUT WHOM ALL THE TALK HAS BEEN 
ASKING A QUESTION OR TWO OF HIS 
CASTLEFORD TEAM MATE I THINK THE WIND IS FAVOURING CASTLEFORD TIGERS DEFENCES ARE DOMINATING BOTH TEAMS 
HAVE LEAD TO A LOT OF TRIES IN 
SUPER LEAGUE LET IN A LOT OF 
TRIES WELLS VERY MUCH AN ATTACKING 
FULLBACK HE HAS SEEN A LOT OF HIS 
RUGBY ON THE WING HE IS HELD UP I THINK HE WAS HELD UP 
THE CASTLEFORD DEFENDERS MADE A UP BIT OF A MESS OF IT BUT EVENTUALLY 
GOT GOOD BODY POSITIONS AND HELD 
HIM UP 
IT IS A TURNOVER 
WITH THE 
WIND BEHIND THEM THEY HAVE GOT TO 
START THINKING THE FORTY TO TWENTY KICK 
HAS GOT TO BE ON HIS MIND JON 
WELLS IS DEFENDING QUITE SHORT 
SOME GOOD TACKLING 
VERY GOOD 
DEFENCE THE WINGER'S HAD NOT 
DROPPED BACK 
THERE IS NO REAL WIND 
ADVANTAGE TO EITHER SIDE IT IS 
SWIRLING AROUND 
I THINK IT IS 
FAVOURING CASTLEFORD AT THE MOMENT 
THAT IS WHERE THEY DID NOT GO FOR 
THE TWO POINTS THAT IS OR WHY HE HAS KICKED THE BALL FROM INSIDE 
HIS FORTY INTO THE TWENTY AND NOW 
CASTLEFORD HAVE THE FIELD THEY 
HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO GET OUT OF 
THEIR HALF SO WHY NOT LOOK AT THE 
FORTY TO TWENTY THE WIND IS VERY STRONG 
FAVOURING CASTLEFORD 
BRENT SHERWIN 
OF COURSE THE MASTERMIND BEHIND 
THE CASTLEFORD SCRUM TERRIFIC TACKLE FROM TONY CLUBB HE 
SPOTTED THE LONG BALL FOR SOME 
LONG BALL YES SHENTON IN FOR THE TRY 
BEAUTIFUL KICK BEAUTIFULLY JUDGED 
MICHAEL SHENTON SWEEPING OUT WIDE 
A TRY FOR THE FORMER CASTLEFORD 
ACADEMY PLAYER OUR FIRST POINTS OF 
THE NIGHT 
THERE IS THE DUMMY KICK 
THERE IS THE MIST PASS LOVELY KICK 
LOVELY WAITED KICK THE WINGER 
COULD NOT DROP BACK INTO THAT WHOLE 
IT NEEDED SOME SCORING FROM SHENTON 
HE HAD TO GET THROUGH HE ATTACKED 
THE BALL 
CRAIG HUBY TO TAKE THE 
KICK IN THE ABSENCE OF JOE 
WESTERMAN THE INJURED EIGHTEEN YOU 
ROLLED EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD PROLIFIC 
POINTS SCORER THE FLAGS GO HIGH AND CASTLEFORD 
TAKE THE LEAD 
A LOVELY DUMMY KICK 
AS THE KICK COMES THROUGH THERE IS 
THE WINGER HE HAS GOT EXTRA MEN 
OUT THERE HE CAN'T REALLY DROP 
BACK INTO THAT SPACE IT IS A 
LOVELY KICK SHENTON ATTACKS IT 
VERY GOOD TRY COMMITTED THE THE WINGER RIKKI SHERIFFE HE HAD TO 
COMMIT HIMSELF TO COMING INSIDE IT IT WAS A CLEVER LITTLE PLAY AND THEY 
HAD THE EXTRA MAN IT PUT THE 
WINGER IN TWO MINDS HE DIDN'T FALL 
BACK AND FILL THAT HOLE 
I THINK 
EVERYONE EXPECTED SHERWIN TO KICK IF ANYTHING AGAINST THE RUN OF PLAY JO WELLS SEEMS TO COME UP AT FULLBACK 
HE COMES IN TO HELP THE FULLBACK FORWARDS GIVES THEM A BREAK DID HE GET THAT DOWN DID HE BOUNCE 
IT THIS WILL BE AN INTERESTING 
CALL FOR THE BALLOT REFEREE THIS WILL BE A TRICKY DECISION DID 
HE GET IT DOWN THE BOUNCE WAS 
FAVOURABLE GOOD ANTICIPATION TO 
COME INSIDE 
HE TURNED AND SPINS 
INSIDE NOT IN CONTROL OF THE BALL 
THAT IS NOT A TRY L. DON'T THINK 
THAT IS A TRY 
NOW THEN HAS HE 
LOST CONTROL YOU HAVE TO HAVE 
DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE BALL THAT THAT IS NOT A TRY HE HAS LOST THE BALL 
NOT A TRY THAT WASN'T A KNOCK ON THAT 
DEFINITELY WENT BEHIND IF WE ARE 
LOOKING AT THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN 
I THINK HE WILL BE LOOKING FOR A 
KNOCK ON 
HIS FOOT IS NOT IN TOUCH 
IT IS NOT 
A TRY L. THINK IT WILL BE A TWENTY METRE TAP 
IT IS NOT A FORWARD 
PASS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
HE IS 
JUST LOOKING AS IF IT IS IN TOUCH 
I THINK IT IS A TWENTY METRE TAP THAT 
WOULD BE MY DECISION DEFINITELY DEFINITELY NOT A TRY THERE WE ARE NO TRY TWENTY 
ME TO RESTART JUDGED A KNOCK ON HE HAS GOT TO COMMIT TO THE 
BOUNCING BALL HE IS A BIT 
LETHARGICCOHEN FOR IT 
TO SCORE A 
TRY EIGHT YOU MUST EXERT DOWNWARD 
PRESSURE WITH THE HAND OFF THE ARM 
OR THE ARM IF YOU DON'T DO THAT 
NO TRY A VERY GOOD KICK THERE RYAN BOYLE HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK 
SINCE HE HAS COME IN 
HE HAS MADE A 
FEW TACKLES GOOD WORK RATE 
A LOT 
OF THESE CASTLEFORD FORWARDS ARE 
PUTTING A LOT OF WORK IN MANY HAVE 
COME THROUGH THE ACADEMY RANKS AND 
ARE PLAYING AS A SET OF SIX HE COMMITTED TO THE BALL IT IS A HIGH TACKLE A RECKLESS TACKLE DAMIEN I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE 
SOMEBODY THERE FOR US 
WHAT IS YOUR 
ASSESSMENT OF THING SO FAR 
CONDITIONS ARE NOT HELPING FOR 
EITHER TEAM THEY ALSO BEAT SEEM 
TO BE COMPLETING AND MAKE IT 
ISN'T AS BAD AS THEY SEEM L. 
THOUGHT IT RIKKI SHERIFFE'S TRY WAS 
A DROP OUT GOOD STRONG RUNNING FROM KIRK DICKSON IT IS A PENALTY YOU GO FOR GOAL 
AND TAKE THE TWO POINTS 
THEY WERE 
THEY WERE HOLDING THE LEAD 
HENRY PAUL ON THE 
LEGS JUST SLOWING HIM DOWN 
IT IS 
AN EASY POSSIBLE TWO POINTS CRAIG HUBY AGAIN NO PROBLEM TWO POINTS EIGHT 
POINTS TO NIL FOR THE TIGERS 
HARLEQUINS WITH A FEW PROBLEMS FROM BEING IN A COMFORTABLE 
POSITION TOTAL CONTROL IN THE 
FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES CERTAINLY BEEN 
SHOCKED CASTLEFORD MAKING MANY FEW MISTAKES THEY ARE RUNNING HARDER NOW THIS 
HAS BEEN EASIER FOR THE KICKERS AND 
PUTTING THE BALL IN THE RIGHT AREAS SHERWIN AGAIN THE ONE THING THEY 
ARE DOING IT CASTLEFORD ARE 
CREATING MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES OF 
THE FIELD THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE 
THERE 
EVERYBODY WAS SUGGESTING THERE THIS WAS GOING TO BE A HIGH SCORING 
MATCH AGAINST TWO OF THE WORST 
DEFENCES IN THE LEAGUE BUT THERE 
HAS HARDLY BEEN A TACKLE MUST 
MISSED HE MIGHT VERY WELL BURY HIS HEAD IN THE GROUND HE SPOTS THE 
THE GROUND FORGOT TO TAKE THE BALL WITH HIM 
HE WILL RECOVER KORKIDAS MAKING THE HARD METRES I THINK MICHAEL KORKIDAS THERE 
WHY GIVE IT ME HE IS OVER A 
GREAT PASS AND SUPERBLY TAKEN BY 
ADAM FLETCHER NO HESITATION WITH 
THAT ONE AT THE CORNER ADAM 
FLETCHER FROM BRISBANE PUTS IT DOWN 
AND CASTLEFORD INCREASE THEIR LEAD 
TEN ZERO 
THAT IS A LOVELY PASS 
LOVELY PASS BY A KIRK DICKSON 
AGAIN THEY HELD THE DUMMY RUNNER A 
LOVELY PASS THEY HAVE BEEN CATCHING THEM OUT 
WITH NUMBERS THAT ONE PASS WOULD 
CREATE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE 
OPPORTUNITY WAS TAKEN A CHANGE IN THE KICKER KIRK DICKSON HE HAS KICKED FORTY GOALS IN THE PAST SO IS A SEASONED CAMPAIGNER IT IS A GOOD EFFORT JUST WIDE 
GREAT EFFORT THERE FROM KIRK 
DICKSON A SCORELINE VERY MUCH IN 
TIGERS FAVOUR 
IF YOU ARE RUNNING 
ON KEEP IT GOING IT IS THE HANDS 
THAT CREATED GREAT PASS AND THEY 
HAVE BEEN UNSURE OF THEIR NUMBERS 
OUT WIDE WE SAW A CHANGE OF KICKER THERE 
CRAIG HUBY IS OFF THE PITCH WITH 
SOME CONCERN ABOUT HIS CONDITION 
HE HAS SOME INJURY TO HIS NECK 
THERE IS AN ICE PACK ON THERE AND 
HE MAY HAVE NERVE DAMAGE THE GOAL 
KICKER IS OFF THE PITCH HIGHLIGHT THE ENTHUSIASM AS A DASH 
OF THIS CASTLEFORD PACK EVERYONE 
WANTS THE BALL EVERYONE IS CHASING FIVE AND ONE HALF MINUTES REMAINING BEFORE THE 
END OF HIGH IF HALF TERM IF 
HALF TIME WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY BACK PLAY FROM 
HARLEQUINS WE HAVEN'T SEEN GAFFER 
IN AN OFFENSIVE FOR GAFA IN A 
DEFENSIVE CAPACITY CAN HE TWIST AND TURN NO HE CAN'T MATT GAFA ARE TRYING TO WORK HIS 
WAY THROUGH THE RAIN POURING DOWN 
NOW IT IS OPEN BUT TAKING GOOD PLAY BY 
DICKSON STOOD HIS GROUND HE MADE 
IT EASY FOR HIS WINGER SHERWIN AND THE REFEREE HAVING A LITTLE CHAT CAPTAINS CAN DO BRENT SHERWIN IS THE CAPTAIN TODAY 
BUT WE HAVE TO CAPTAINS IN THE 
CASTLEFORD RANKS AWEN GUTTENBEIL 
IS A CAPTAIN AS WELL HOW DO YOU 
ACCOUNT FOR THIS 
THEY ARE TRYING 
IT IN AUSTRALIA IN THE RUGBY UNION 
GAME I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF 
NAMING TWO CAPTAINS HALF BACKS 
GENERALLY LEAD L. L. DON'T UNDERSTAND 
I THINK THE IDEA WAS BECAUSE OF THE 
REPLACEMENT SITUATION ONE IS ON 
AND ONE IS OFF BUT LIKE YOU I 
DON'T KNOW GARETH HAGGERTY 
STEALING THE BALL YOU CAN STEAL A 
BALL ONE ON ONE BUT NOT TOO ON ONE 
I THINK HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING 
BECAUSE HE HAD SMILE ON HIS FACE HARLEQUINS GETTING VERY FRUSTRATED 
IN THIS LAST FIVE OR TEN MINUTES 
THE FORWARDS LAID THE PLATFORM AND 
BRENT SHERWIN IS CONTROLLING 
EVERYTHING IT IS NOT HAPPENING 
WITH DANNY ORR AND HENRY PAUL AT 
THE MOMENT THEY ARE NOT HAVING THE 
PLATFORM AND THEY HAVE HAD NO FIELD 
POSITION 
ANOTHER TWO POINTS POSITION CASTLEFORD FANS GRATEFULLY 
ACCEPTING THOSE POINTS 
ALL THEY 
HAVE GOT TO DO NOW IS PLAYED THE 
LAST SET OUT GOING TO HALF TIME 
AND START AGAIN GO IN 
I DON'T 
THINK BRIAN MCDERMOTT WILL BE 
PLEASED WITH THE OPENING FORTY MINUTES 
FROM THE HARLEQUINS 
I THINK HE 
WILL HAVE A FEW CHOICE WORDS TO SAY 
AT 
HALF TIME MORE THAN A FEW LESS THAN A MINUTE REMAINING TILL HALF TIME 
HE DOES NOT LOOK HAPPY HE DOES NOT THAT FACE COULD PUT THIRTY YEARS ON A MING VASE THEY HAVE JUST GOT TO PUT IT OVER 
THE TOUCH LINE NOW 
TERRY MATTISON 
DOES NOT LOOK ANY HAPPIER 
HE WILL 
BE HAPPY A PENALTY BUT IT WILL NOT BE OF MUCH VALUE NORMAL TIME IS UP HE DID NOT FIND TOUCH AND THERE IS 
THE HOOTER IT IS ALL OVER FOR THE 
FIRST FORTY MINUTES A BAD KICK FROM 
HARLEQUINS IT SIGNALS THE END OF 
THE FIRST FORTY MINUTES IT HAS BEEN 
ALL CASTLEFORD TRIES FROM SHENTON 
AND FLETCHER FOURTEEN TO ZERO TO CASTLEFORD 
FOR TWENTY MINUTES NOT MUCH GROUND 
GIVEN OR TAKEN THEN CASTLEFORD 
MADE THE BREAKTHROUGH MICHAEL 
SHENTON ON THE END OF THE GRUBBER 
KICK HARLEQUINS THOUGHT THEY HAD 
THE MUSCLE TO REPLY BUT RIKKI 
SHERIFFE WAS HELD UP SLICK PASSING 
OF A GREASY BALL WAS HARD BUT 
CASTLEFORD MARKED MASTERED IT AND 
ADAM FLETCHER WAS ON THE END OF 
THIS ONE ONE MORE PENALTY AND THE 
TIGERS HEAD IN WITH A FOURTEEN TO ZERO LEAD 
NOT NECESSARILY THE MATCH WE WERE 
EXPECTING GIVEN HOW MANY POINTS 
THESE SIDES HAVE LEAKED THEIR 
DEFENSIVE QUALITIES WERE VERY 
STRONG 
IT HAS BECOME A BIT OF AN STRONG ARM WRESTLE SHERWIN HAS TAKEN A 
GRIP OF THE GAME HIS KICKING HAS 
BEEN SUPERB HE HAS KICKED FOR THE 
CORNERS AND FOUND HIS TEAM SOME 
FIELD POSITION 
BRIAN MCDERMOTT WILL BE SPEAKING TO 
HARLEQUINS ABOUT FINDING THEMSELVES 
A KICKING GAME GET INTO THE RIGHT 
END OF THE FIELD AND PUT IN SIMILAR 
PLAYERS ON BUT SHERWIN IS RUNNING 
THE SHOW 
YOU HAVE TO BE AN EXPERT 
TO ADMIRE THE DEFENSIVE GAME THERE 
IS NO ONE MORE EXPERT THAN SHAUN 
EDWARDS EDWARDS I HAVE GOT FOOT IN BOTH CAMPS 
AM STILL A FAN OF LONDON BRONCOS 
AND CASTLEFORD HAVE LOT OF 
FRIENDS IN CASTLEFORD AM VERY 
GOOD FRIENDS WITH TERRY MATTERSON 
WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE 
FIRST HALF CASTLEFORD ON TOP BE BE IT HAS BEEN THE PERFECT HALF OF 
RUGBY BEFORE CASTLEFORD L. DON'T 
REMEMBER THEM DROPPING THE BALL 
ONCE IN THESE CONDITIONS THEIR 
DEFENCE HAS BEEN ROCK SOLID IT HAS 
TAKEN A LOT OUT OF HARLEQUINS THEY 
ARE NEVER DROPPING THE BALL IT IS 
SUPERB 
DO STILL FOLLOW THE RUGBY SUPERB LEAGUE GAME AS CLOSELY AS EVER I I LIKE BOTH CODES L. AM STILL A BIG 
FAN OF RUGBY LEAGUE 
WHAT DO 
HARLEQUINS HAVE TO DO IN THE SECOND 
HALF TO UNLOCK THE DEFENCE THEY THEY WOULD LIKE TO THINK CASTLEFORD WILL 
NOT BE AS PERFECT AS THEY WERE IN 
THE FIRST HALF SURELY THEY CANNOT 
KEEP IT UP FOR EIGHTY MINUTES QUICKLY QUICKLY WILL YOU BE BACK IN RUGBY LEAGUE 
SOON 
I HAVE AGREED A THREE AND A SOON HALF YEAR DEAL EXTENSION WITH WASPS 
I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY THERE AND 
WITH THE WELSH RUGBY UNION 
THERE WERE A THING HE HAS GOT TOO 
MANY OTHERS TO COME BACK FOR QUITE 
A WHILE WE SORT BRIAN MCDERMOTT 
CHATTING TO THE HARLEQUINS PLAYERS 
WHAT WOULD HE BE SAYING THE THE CASTLEFORD FORWARD PACK HAVE 
MUSCLED UP REALLY WELL DEFENSIVELY 
THEY HAVE BEEN SUPERIOR AND 
OFFENSIVELY THEY HAVE BEEN GETTING 
FORWARD REALLY WELL LIKE BRIAN 
SAID THEY HAVE REALLY BEEN 
FINISHING I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY 
THAT THE FORWARDS HAVE TO STEP UP 
TO THE PLATE AND BE MORE PHYSICAL 
IN DEFENCE AND GET FORWARD PROPERLY 
THEY HAVE NOT HAD A LOT OF LUCK TO 
BE FAIR TO THEM HARLEQUINS LOOKED 
LIKE THEY WOULD BE FIRST ON THE 
SCOREBOARD 
THIS IS SUPERB DEFENCE SCOREBOARD SHENTON GETS UNDERNEATH THE 
HARLEQUINS PLAYER THEY ARE SMART 
OFF THE LINE EVEN THIS PASS IS NOT 
DIRECTED TO ANYBODY IN PARTICULAR 
SO HE IS ABLE TO PICK IT UP AND LET 
THEM OFF THE HOOK ANOTHER GREAT 
DECISION BY SHENTON ANY OTHER 
GIVEN DAY PURDHAM AND MIGHT HAVE 
GOT ACROSS THE LINE 
WHAT SET UP 
THE CASTLEFORD TRY IT WAS A FORTY TO 
TWENTY 
IT BASICALLY MEANS THAT IF YOU TWENTY ARE THE ATTACKING TEAM AND YOU KICK 
YOUR BALL LONG FROM INSIDE YOUR OWN 
FORTY AND IT GOES OUT WITHOUT GOING 
OUT ON THE FAULT INSIDE THE 
OPPOSITIONS TWENTY YOU GET THE FEED TO 
THE SCRUM OUT ON THE FULL RECEDE RECEDE TO CASTLEFORD PLAYERS GO AT THE 
LINE AND FIX FOR HARLEQUINS 
DEFENDERS WE SEE TWO CARS OF THE 
PLAYERS THAT MEANS THEY HAVE AN 
EXTRA PLAYER ON THE OUTSIDE THE 
WINGER HAS TO STAY UP BECAUSE HE 
HAS GOT AN OVERLAP ON THE OUTSIDE 
SO HE HAS TO DEFEND THAT YOU ARE 
RELIANT ON THE FULL BACK THE KICK 
IS SO SPOT ON 
IT BOUNCES UP JUST 
AT THE RIGHT MOMENT WHICH IS SOME 
ELEMENT OF LUCK AS WELL HARLEQUINS 
HAD ANOTHER CHANCE THAT DID NOT 
COME OFF RIKKI SHERIFFE THE THE CASTLEFORD PLAYERS WERE NOT GETTING 
ACROSS IN GOOD NUMBERS THE 
HARLEQUINS PLAYERS GET THERE IN 
GOOD NUMBERS THE BALL POPS UP AT 
THE RIGHT TIME WAS IT KNOCKED ON 
ONE ON ONE ON THE TRY LINE 
WAINWRIGHT CAME UP WITH A GREAT 
TACKLE AND HE LOST CONTROL AS HE 
TRIED TO PUT THE BALL DOWN NO NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS NO TRY 
WAINWRIGHT DESERVES A PIECE OF THE 
CAKE AS HE HITS THE BALL OUT OF HIS 
GRASP YOU ARE ALLOWED TO DO THAT 
ONE ON ONE ON THE TRY LINE THAT 
EXTRA BIT DESIRE ON THE TRY LINE 
HAS SAVED THEM TWELVE POINTS 
THE BALL 
IS PRETTY GREASY AND WE HAVE NOT 
SEEN MUCH SLIPPED PASSING THIS IS 
PROBABLY THE BEST EXAMPLE AND GAVE 
CASTLEFORD THEIR SECOND TRY THIS THIS IS A NUMBERS THING YOU HAVE GOT TO 
GIVE DICKSON IN THE CENTRE OF 
CREDIT IAN DIXON A SUPERB PIECE 
OF SKILL THE WINGER DECIDES HE IS 
HAVING HIM IN THE MIDDLE BUT THE 
QUALITY OF PASS ATTACKS THE 
HARLEQUINS DEFENDERS AND ENABLE US 
THE WINGER TO SCORE IN THE CORNER 
THAT PUT CASTLEFORD IN THE 
ASCENDANCY AT THE END OF THIS 
MATCH IF YOU HAVE AN INTERACTIVE 
TELEVISION AND YOU PRESS YOUR RED 
BUTTON WE WILL HAVE OUR RUGBY 
LEAGUE FOR HIM THIS IS WHAT YOU 
CAN EXPECT 
WELCOME TO OUR CHALLENGE CUP FOR 
ORAM THEN SHE FOR TAKING THE 
OPTION OF PRESSING THE RED BUTTON 
I DON'T THINK THAT IS WITHIN THE 
SPIRIT OF THE GAME 
IT IS TIME FOR 
A HEALTHY DEBATE 
I DISAGREE WITH 
BRIAN I'M LOOKING AT IT FROM THE 
OUTSIDE 
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE OUTSIDE ALL THE BEST PLAYERS YOU WILL HEAR A FRANK EXCHANGE OF 
VIEWS LOTS OF BITS AND OPINIONS 
EXCHANGE AND YOU HAVE YOUR OWN 
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE 
I AM VERY PLEASED TO SAY THAT WE 
HAVE BEEN JOINED IN OUR DRESSING 
ROOM WHICH IS NOT AS DIRTY AS THAT 
ONE BY NEWLY CROWNED CASTLEFORD 
TIGERS PLAYER DWAIN CHAMBERS HOW 
WERE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR 
FIRST MATCH NEXT WEEKEND 
IT HAS 
BEEN A LONG TIME COMING L. HAD BEEN 
IN RUGBY THREE WEEKS NOW THE THE EXCITING PART IS I WILL BE PLAYING 
EVERYONE IS EXCITING TO SEE WHETHER 
I CAN CATCH THE BALL AND RUN WITH 
IT EXCITED TRAINING HAS BEEN 
GOING REALLY WELL THEY HAVE BEEN 
KILLING ME WITH THESE MALCOLM'S 
THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN ME GIVING 
ME STUFF I AM NOT USED TO DOING AS 
AN ATHLETE 
THE OTHER THING YOU ARE 
NOT USED TO DOING IS WORKING AS A 
TEAM AS AN ATHLETE YOU ARE MEANT 
TO BE SELFISH HOW HIGH IT THE 
OTHER PLAYERS REACTING TO YOU IT IT HAS BEEN GREAT L. HAVE HAD TEAM 
EXPERIENCE IN THE RELAYS 
AND A BIT 
WITH AMERICAN FOOTBALL AS WELL I I HAVE A FAIR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT 
TO DO N. EIGHTEEN IT IS WORKING WELL L. AM 
HERE TO SUPPORT THE TEAM WHAT WHAT WOULD YOUR ADVICE BE DO THINK HE 
IS BRAVE TO TRY THIS 
I THINK HE IS 
EXTREMELY BRAVE IT IS A GREAT 
CHALLENGE AND A GREAT OPPORTUNITY 
NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE BLESSED WITH 
THAT KIND OF SPEED HE MIGHT BE 
GOING BACKWARDS AS FAST AS HE IS 
GOING FORWARD WHEN THE BIGGER 
BLOKES GET HOLD OF HIM THERE IS 
THAT PHYSICAL ELEMENT OF HAVING TO 
GET OFF YOUR BACKSIDE WHEN PEOPLE 
PUT YOU THERE IT IS A DIFFERENT 
KIND OF FITNESS 
ARE YOU IMPRESSED 
BY THE FITNESS LEVEL OF RUGBY 
LEAGUE PLAYERS AND THEIR SPEED 
YOUR BEST IS 
NINE POINT NINE SEVEN ARE YOU 
SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER BY FAR BUT 
SPEED IS NOTHING IF I DON'T 
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON ON THE 
FIELD THERE IS A LOT TO LEARN L. 
AM STILL IN THE INFANCY IN THIS 
SPORT 
THERE WILL BE SOME DEFENSIVE SPORT PLAYERS QUITE LOOKING FORWARD TO 
THE TASTY MEAT OF TAKING YOU OUT 
THEY HAVE GOT TO CATCH ME FIRST 
SIMPLE AS THAT THE TEAM ARE 
PREPARING ME WELL HAVE HAD A LOT 
OF GREAT TUITION FROM THE GUYS THE 
TEAM MANAGEMENT HAD BEEN SUPERB IN 
PREPARING ME FOR NEXT WEEK L. AM READY 
IS THIS IT FOR YOU 
I SHOWED WHEN I 
WAS WINNING RUNNING THAT I CAN DO 
IT HERE 
STAY AWAY FROM THE BIG 
UGLY BLOKES WOULD BE SQUASHED NOSES 
AND THE STICKY OUT EARS AS 
AS 
AS FAR AS THE RESERVE MATCHES ARE CONCERNED 
IS ANYBODY THAT WILL BE ABLE TO 
COME AND WATCH THAT 
THE MORE 
SUPPORT THE BETTER 
AS FAR AS SOME 
PEOPLE SAY IT IS A PUBLICITY STUNT 
IS IT 
IT IS NOT YOU HAVE SEEN ME 
TRAINING AND ALL THE STUFF THAT HAS 
BEEN IN THE PAPER TO BEGIN WITH 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED THAT 
WAY I REALISE HOW MUCH I AM 
ENJOYING THE ROPE BID RUGBY SIDE 
OF IT L. AM NOT USED TO THE COLD 
AND THE RAIN 
THEY ARE YOUR TEAM 
MATES LEAVING THE DRESSING ROOM WE 
WILL HEAR FROM THE ONE OF THE 
COACHING STAFF 
COLIN MASCALL 
PRETTY RUTHLESS IN THE FIRST HALF 
IS THAT THE MESSAGE IN THE DRESSING 
ROOM 
THE COMPLETION FROM THE BOYS ROOM TWENTY OUT OF TWENTY WE CAN'T ASK FOR MUCH 
MORE THAN THAT THEY IS A LOT OF 
FOOTBALL IN THIS GAME YET THEY ARE 
COMING OUT FIRING NOW GREASY GREASY CONDITIONS OUT THERE A BIT OF A 
LEVELLER HOPEFULLY WE CAN KICK ON SECOND HALF READY FOR UNDER WAY BRENT SHERWIN DIRECTING THEM AT THE MOMENT 
THEY ARE TAKING THE BALL UP MOMENT COMPLETING THE SAID ANY 
OPPORTUNITIES HAVE AND THEY HAVE 
TAKEN THEM THEY HAVE GREATEST 
NUMBERS ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT FLANK 
THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM FOR THE 
HARLEQUINS IF THEY DON'T WORK THAT 
OUT SOME SHORT SHARP MESSAGES FOR THE 
HARLEQUINS I AM SURE THEY WILL 
PERFORM BETTER IN THE SECOND HALF A LEAD OF FOURTEEN N. T. S. FOR CASTLEFORD 
NOT A MATCH WINNING SCORE BACK IN 
RUGBY LEAGUE ANY SIDE CAN GET A 
ROLL ON AND CAN EASILY KNOCK ON OFF 
FOURTEEN POINTS TO TACKLES REMAINING IN THE SEQUENCE CAN THEY KEEP HIM BEHIND YES THEY 
CAN THIS WAS THE MOMENTUM I WAS 
TALKING ABOUT THAT TALKING ABOUT AT THINK WE CAN SEE HOW SLIPPERY 
THE PITCH IS NOW A WITH THE 
CONSTANT RAIN FOR THE PAST HOUR AND 
A HALF 
STILL IN VERY GOOD 
CONDITION THOUGH LOOKS TO BE MORE ENTHUSIASM IN THE HARLEQUINS OUTFIT SUPERB TRY BEAUTIFUL PLAY MICHAEL 
WORRINCY TOOK IT LIKE A DREAM 
POINTS TO ZERO IS NOT A BIG LEAD 
HENRY PAUL HALL'S THE BALL LATE 
PASS A GOOD ANGLE BAD DEFENSIVE 
MISTAKE THERE HENRY PAUL HOLDS 
THE BALL HENRY PAUL HELD AND HELD 
THE BALL 
ROB PURDHAM ADDING ON TWO 
POINTS 
THERE IS A DUMMY RUN HE POINTS HOLDS AND HOLDS AND HOLDS THIS MAN 
HAS GOT TO COME IN HE HAS NO 
OPTION HE CUTS THE LINE LOVELY 
STEP LOVELY PLAY HENRY PAUL BACK 
INTO THE GAME A DARK AND DISMAL EVENING WITH THE 
WEATHER HERE THE FLOOD LIGHTS HAVE 
BEEN ON WELL BEFORE KICKER UP AT 
FIVE THIRTY P. M. KICK OFF ONCE AGAIN COULD CATCHING HAVING A 
GOOD GAME IS THE CASTLEFORD FULL 
BACK THE REMAINDER OF THIS FOURTH ROUND 
CARNEGIE CHALLENGE CUP TIE IT IS 
BEING HELD TOMORROW AND THE DRAW 
FOR THE FIFTH ROUND IS TUESDAY 
SUDDENLY THINGS GOING WRONG FOR 
TIGERS 
THAT IS THEIR FIRST MISTAKE TIGERS HE HOLDS AND HOLDS IF I THINK IT 
WAS KIRK DICKSON THAT DIDN'T COME 
IN 
I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE IN DICED DIVED AT THE END THERE L. 
WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED TO LOSE 
THE BALL SUDDENLY THE HARLEQUINS FANS ARE GETTING BEHIND THE SIDE HE IS OVER CHAD RANDALL IS OVER 
SUDDENLY HARLEQUINS ARE FIRING ON 
ALL CYLINDERS 
THE BIG DIFFERENCE 
IS THE PACE THE PACE THEY ARE 
PLAYING THEY ALL STAND OFF HIM 
POOR DEFENCE NO COMMUNICATION 
THERE HE GOES CLAYTON STAYS DOWN 
NO ONE WAS PICKING HIM UP THE ROB PURDHAM LOOKING FOR A 
SECOND CONVERSION AND HE FINDS IT 
SUDDENLY THE GAME TURNED ON ITS 
HEAD FOURTEEN TWELVE NOW FOR THEM CASTLEFORD 
THEY HAVE GOT TO GET CASTLEFORD THE FOCUS NOW CASTLEFORD TIGERS 
HARLEQUINS ARE ON A ROLL THE RAIN STILL TEEMING DOWN HERE THAT IS A GOOD KICK SEN'S TOM 
LEARNED RIGHT BACK IT BOUNCED ON 
THE LINE SEND SO I DON'T THINK THE TOUCH REFEREE WAS ANYWHERE NEAR HE WAS VERY UNFORTUNATE THERE WEATHER LIKE THIS YOU DO WANT CLEAN QUICK BALLS THAT IS A GOOD KICK BUT IT HAS GONE 
STRAIGHT OUT 
JUST WATCH 
PRESSURE HERE 
IT WAS A GOOD TACKLE 
ON SHOW WHEN 
THE PRESSURE WAS ON 
HIM AND THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE 
THAT IS OUT ON THE FULL 
A THREE 
INCHES HARLEQUINS ON THE ATTACK 
AGAIN COULD TACKLING MEYER FROM THACKERAY 
THERE FROM THACKERAY HE HAS 
DROPPED IT GARETH HAGGERTY HAS 
DROPPED IT HE CAME IN AT THE 
PERFECT MOMENT 
I DON'T THINK THEY 
COULD HAVE STOPPED HIM FROM THERE TEN MINUTES GONE TWO N. T. S. THE DIFFERENCE NOW GOOD PLAY FROM CASTLEFORD MICHAEL WAINWRIGHT JUST EIGHTEEN YEARS OF 
AGE HE HAS DROPPED THE BALL 
HAGGARTY MAKING AMENDS TO DROP SOMEBODY THE WEIGHT OF 
MICHAEL KORKIDAS THAT NEEDS 
UNDOING SOME DOING HE KICKED THIS YOU KICK THIS DO YOU NO PUT IT TO TOUCH THREE METRES FROM THE CAST THIRD LINE CASTLEFORD LINE THAT IS A KNOCK ON OFFSIDE AGAIN 
THE REFEREE HE PLAYED ADVANTAGE 
OFFSIDE BOTH FEET MUST BE BEHIND 
THE TRY LINE NOT ONE BUT TWO HE 
IS TAKING THE KICK HE HAS TO DO 
FROM THIS POSITION 
THEY ARE ALL 
OFFSIDE THE RIGHT CALL WENT TOO 
EARLY THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR OF 
THEM OFFSIDE HE PLAYS ADVANTAGE ROBERT PURDHAM COLLECTS ANOTHER 
TWO POINTS NOW SQUARE IN 
TWICKENHAM AT LAST A RESPONSE FOR 
THE QUINS FANS AND ALL IN THIRTEEN MINUTES A POINT IN MINUTE DON'T FORGET OUR INTERACTIVE FORUM WHICH FOLLOWS THIS PROGRAMME THESE FORWARDS ARE RUNNING WITH 
MUCH MORE VIGOUR NOW 
THEY HAVE GOT 
TO TAKE THE CHALLENGE CUP AND MAKE 
THOSE YARDS TO GIVE A PLATFORM TO 
HENRY 
THE MOST INTERESTING ASPECT HENRY IS THAT CASTLEFORD HAVE HARDLY HAD 
THE BALL IN THIS HALF THEY HAVE 
RARELY TOUCHED IT 
WE MAY HAVE IT 
HAS BEEN IN THEIR OWN TWENTY WHEN 
THEY HAVE 
THAT IS THE SET OF SIX 
I AM WITH WILL SHARP HOW DO YOU 
EXPLAIN THIS COMEBACK 
THE COACH 
TOLD THEM WHAT TO DO AT HALF TIME 
UP THE TEMPO THEY ARE DOING WHAT 
HE SAID THE LADS HAVE COME OUT AND 
UPPED THE TEMPO 
YOU WERE NEVER 
REALLY IN IT IN THE FIRST HALF 
THEY WERE DEFENDING VERY WELL WHEN 
THEY HAD THE BALL THE POSSESSION AND TERRITORIAL FIGURES ARE VERY REVEALING THAT WILL BE A SET OF SIX FOR HARLEQUINS PAUL AND RANDALL CONTROLLING THINGS NOW THE AGONY TO BE SO CLOSE IT IS A 
COMEDY OF ERRORS DANNY ORR WAS 
SMASHED 
THAT'S IS A BAD ONE HE SMASHED PLAYED ADVANTAGE 
THERE WAS 
ADVANTAGE HE HAD A SWIPE AT IT 
THEN HE TRIPPED TEN THEN HE KNOCKS 
ON 
BUT WHO KNOCKED ON DEFINITELY ON DEFINITELY THE HARLEQUIN PLAYER 
MELLING WAS 
IN TWO MINDS AS TO WHAT TO DO I I THINK HE WAS TRIPPED THE RIGHT 
DECISION KNOW THOUGH SCOTT MOORE ON LOAN FROM SAINT HELENS JULIEN RINALDI THE FORMER CATALAN DRAGONS MAN COMING ON THERE IS THE FLOP AGAIN HOLDING HIM DOWN HARLEQUINS EDGING TOWARDS 
CASTLEFORD'S COMPLETION RATE THAT 
IS A FASTER DIFFERENCE FROM HALF 
TIME WHEN THEY WERE DOWN TOWARDS FORTY 
PER CENT 
A VAST DIFFERENCE HE CALLED IT TONY CLUBB BUT IS IT A TRY IS CHECKING FOR ON SIDE 
I THINK HE HAD TO BE ON SIDE THEY 
WERE VERY FLAT 
CHECK FROM THE HIGH 
CAMERA YEAH 
COULDN'T SEE WHAT IS CAMERA YEAH WRONG IN THAT 
HE DID COMMIT TO THE 
BALL THAT IS A TRY 
TONE THE CLUB 
JUST TWENTY YEARS OF AGE BIG POWERFUL 
WINGER TONY CLUBB DID SOME FINE 
TACKLING IN THE EARLY PART OF THE 
MATCH HAS HE GOT THIS TRY THE THE TOUCH JUDGE WAS RIGHT IN LINE WITH 
HIM HE HAS COMMITTED TO THE BALL 
IT LOOKS A TRY TO ME OR WAS THERE 
SOME INTERFERENCE 
NO INTERFERENCE 
HE COMMITTED TO THE BALL THE 
DEFENDERS JUST DID WAITED FOR THE 
BALL TO COME TO THEM JUST STOOD 
THERE IS ENOUGH HANDS TIME AND 
THERE 
HE COMMITS TO THE BALL THERE WHEREAS THE CASTLEFORD DEFENDERS DO 
NOT COMMIT THAT IS A TRY THE THE CASTLEFORD PLAYER HIMSELF MAKES NO 
REPRESENT SHOWED TO THE REFEREE 
REPRESENTATION THAT LOOKS A TRY TO 
ME 
THE 
BEST GUIDE THERE IN THE ME BEST POSITION IS THE TOUCH JUDGE 
NO ONE ELSE HE IS IN THE BEST 
POSITION GOT TO BE A TRY 
WE WILL 
KNOW ANY SECOND TONY CLUBB PUTS 
HIS FIST IN THE AIR THE HARLEQUINS 
IN THE LEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME EIGHTEEN 
FOURTEEN CONVERSION ATTEMPT TO COME 
WHAT A TURN AROUND ROB PURDHAM A PROLIFIC POINTS 
SCORER FOR QUINS SUDDENLY 
HARLEQUINS AND OPENED A SIX POINT 
GAP HARLEQUINS OPENED 
THE WAY 
IT IS GOING IT LOOKS A LONG WAY 
BACK FOR CASTLEFORD THEY HAVE NOT 
BEEN IN THE SECOND HALF COMMITS TO 
THE BALL AND A WELL TAKEN TRY THE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT SHERWIN HE WAS 
COMMANDING THE GAME IN THE FIRST 
HALF IS BEING DENIED POSSESSION 
IT IS A KNOCK ON EFFECT IT ALL 
COMES FROM THE FORWARDS THEY HAVE 
MADE THE YARDAGE HALF BACKS HAVE 
CONTROLLED THE SECOND HALF THE 
OUTSIDE BACKS HAVE BECOME INVOLVED 
AS WELL THEY HAVE PICKED THE TEMPO 
UP AND CASTLEFORD HAVE BEEN TIRED 
THE EXECUTION OF THE TRIES HAS BEEN 
GOOD 
THE CASTLEFORD BENCH ARE GOOD THERE PREPARING RYAN MCGOLDRICK 
TO COME ON BRIAN MCDERMOTT THE 
QUINS COACH PINPOINTED HIM AS A 
DANGER MAN CAN HE TURN THINGS 
AROUND FOR CASTLEFORD HARLEQUINS KICKING WELL TOO 
PRESSURISING DON THEM STUART 
DONLAN THAT IS BETTER RUNNING FROM CASTLEFORD IT IS AN AMAZING THING MOMENTUM 
HE HAS GOT IT AND WHO HAS NOT WE 
HAVE SEEN A COMPLETE TURNAROUND IN 
FORTUNES FOR THE HARLEQUINS TEAM 
THEY HAVE NOT LED SHERWIN KICK FOR 
FREE THEIR FORWARDS HAVE DONE A 
LOT BETTER HENRY PAUL AND DANNY 
ORR DICTATING THE SHOW NOW MAGNIFICENT FROM DANNY ORR WE 
SAID EARLIER HE HAD BEEN IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORM THIS SEASON 
THAT WAS ABSOLUTE CLASS FROM THE 
LITTLE MAN SUPERB CAREER HE HAD 
WITH CASTLEFORD HE SCORED SEVENTY ONE TRIES 
FOR THEM THAT IS JUST HIS FIFTH FOR 
HARLEQUINS BUT VERY VERY 
IMPORTANT ONE DANNY ORR THE 
SCORER 
GREAT STRIKE A GOOD PACE SCORER GREAT TRY LOVELY TRY LOVELY 
SPEED HE LOOKS UP THERE IS NO 
SUPPORT HE GOES I TELL YOU WHAT 
I CAN SCORE THIS MCGOLDRICK COMES 
ON AND HE GETS ROUND HIM STRAIGHT 
AWAY PURDHAM MAINTAINS HIS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT RECORD TONIGHT TONIGHT THERE IS A BIG FORWARD IN TONIGHT FRONT OF HIM HE DECIDES TAKE HIM 
ON STEPS INSIDE AND HE IS A WAVE 
MCGOLDRICK HAS JUST COME ON HE 
THINKS HE MIGHT BE A BIT SLOW TO 
GET INTO THE GAME VERY VERY GOOD 
TRY DANNY ORR GOOD AWARENESS 
SEES THE MISMATCH AND TAKES THE 
FORWARD ON 
THAT MOMENTUM THAT 
BRIAN WAS TALKING ABOUT I WOULD NOT MIND ASKING BRIAN IF 
HE COULD ANSWER HOW DO CASTLEFORD 
TO GET BACK INTO THIS GAME THEY THEY HAVE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO STOP 
HARLEQUINS THEY HAVE TO PUT SOME 
PRESSURE ON DANNY ORR AND RANDOLPH 
THEY HAVE GOT TO GET TO THE RIGHT 
END OF THE FIELD WE SAW IN THE 
FIRST HALF THAT THEY WILL SCORE 
POINTS THEY HAVE TO BE PATIENT 
WHEN YOU HAVE GOT DANNY ORR KICKING 
INTO THE CORNERS AND ESTABLISHING 
THAT FIELD POSITION IT BECOMES 
MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGING FOR 
HARLEQUINS THEY WILL STAY IN 
DEFENCE AND DO ALL THE TOUGH STUFF 
THEY WEREN'T DOING IN THE FIRST 
HALF 
THE WIND IS A LOT STRONGER HALF THAN IT LOOKS THE LENGTH OF THE 
KICKS ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE FIRST 
HALF THE FORWARDS HAVE NOT GOT TO 
THE FIELD POSITION THE KICKING IS 
A LOT TOUGHER 
WE MENTION SOME 
FAMOUS CASTLEFORD HALF BACKS AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE SECOND HALF BUT 
DANNY ORR IS SAYING ANYTHING 
SHERWIN CAN DO I CAN DO BETTER A A TOTAL REVERSAL OF FORTUNE FOR THE 
TWO SIDES THE FORWARDS HAVE PICKED 
UP THE TEMPO UP AND MADE IT EASIER 
FOR THE HALF BACKS AGAIN AGAIN CASTLEFORD CAN CALL IT BACKS STILL 
HAUL IT BACK NOT A KNOCK ON 
SAYS THE REFEREE MATT GAFA HAS NOT REALLY HAD ANY SCORE CHANCES TERRIFIC RUNNING FROM HAGGERTY I THINK WAS THAT A KNOCK DOWN ATTEMPTING A DROP DEFENSIVELY THEY HAVE GOT HIM IN THE RIGHT AREA GARETH HAGGERTY COMING IN THERE 
WITH ANOTHER STRONG TACKLE BOTH 
SIDES WITH FOR INTO CHANGES LEFT 
FOUR GOOD STRONG PLAY THERE BETWEEN THE TWO HOOKERS IT IS A TRY IS THERE INTERFERENCE 
THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE GOT TO ASK 
AND INTERFERENCE WE ARE LOOKING FOR NOT OFFSIDE NOBODY IS OFFSIDE I DON'T THINK THAT IS INTERFERENCE I THINK YOU JUST USES THE BALL 
DAVID HOWELL HAS NO PROBLEM IN 
CATCHING IT 
THAT IS A TRY NO 
DOUBT ABOUT IT THERE IS NO INTERFERENCE WAS SOME 
EVER 
HE LOSES THE BALL HE COMES 
OUT ROUND THE BACK HE'S JUST 
HANGING HE DOESN'T DO ANY 
INTERFERENCE AT ALL THEY BOTH MISS IT DAVID HOWELL 
PUTS IT DOWN SURELY THIS MUST BE 
ANOTHER TRY FOR THE CENTRE DAVID 
HOWELL GRABS A TOUCHDOWN AND SURELY 
NOW HARLEQUINS WITH ACES TENSION 
WILL REVERSE IN THE SECOND HALF 
MUST BE ON THEIR WAY TO THE 
CHALLENGE CUP DRAW ON TUESDAY 
HURRICANES WITH A SENSATIONAL 
REVERSAL HARLEQUINS LIKE THE PREVIOUS FIVE ALL OVER THE CROSSBAR TWELVE POINTS STUART DONLAN SHOUTS FOR IT THERE 
WERE ANOTHER TWO GIVING UP AT THE 
SAME TIME JUST OVER TEN MINUTES REMAINING 
THEY ARE RUNNING RIOT NOW DOWN THE 
MIDDLE CHAD RANDALL HAS HAD A 
GREAT INFLUENCE RANDALL AND RINALDI WORKING IN COMBINATION THAT IS ANOTHER BAD BOUNCE THERE 
WILL BE A DROP OUT UNDER THE POSTS 
EVERY BOUNCE HAS GONE AGAINST 
CASTLEFORD IN THE SECOND HALF I I THOUGHT THAT WAS A POOR KICK BY 
DANNY ORR THE BOUNCE FAVOURED 
HARLEQUINS 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT A HARLEQUINS POOR KICK I WISH I COULD KICK LIKE 
THAT GIVE THE MAN CREDIT HEGARTY AGAIN POUNDING IN HAGGARTY GOOD BALL GOOD TACKLE AS WELL HE IS OVER GARETH HAGGERTY HAS 
DESERVE TO THAT TRY HE LOST THE 
BALL OVER THE LINE BUT HAS PULLED 
ONE BACK FOR THE HARLEQUINS SOME 
STRONG POWERFUL RUNNING FROM THE 
REPLACEMENTS 
HE HAS MADE A BIG REPLACEMENTS IMPACT SINCE COMING ON HE HAS 
CARRIED THE BALL EXTREMELY WELL HE 
IS REWARDED WITH THIS TRY HE RUNS 
AT THE SCORE A MAN SPINS OUT A VET 
VERY DIFFICULT WHEN A BIG MAN RUNS 
ON A SMALL MAN 
A WHAT A SMILE ON 
HIS FACE FOR SPINS OUT OF IT HE 
IS A BIGGER MAN THAN HIS DAD HE IS CERTAINLY VERY POWERFUL SEVEN GOALS I THINK FOR PURDHAM JUST PICKS THE SMALLER MAN 
THACKERAY TO POWERFUL TOO QUICK TOO POWERFUL THAT IS THE FIRST MISTAKE IN THE 
SECOND HALF FOR THE HARLEQUINS THE THE CONDITIONS ARE VERY BAD NOW JUST A COUPLE OF INCHES CHANGES A 
PIECE BUT I DON'T THINK AT THIS 
SITE WILL BE TOO CONCERNED ABOUT 
THAT NOW INTO CHANGES CASTLEFORD LOOKING FOR SOME CONSOLATION THACKERAY NOT ABLE TO GET AWAY GOOD RUNNING THERE FROM MICHAEL WELL TAKEN AND WELL PICKED UP ANOTHER ATTEMPT DOWN THIS LEFT HAND 
SIDE NICKY SHERIFFE CAME IN VERY 
WELL THERE HARLEQUINS HAVE DONE WELL RANDALL HAS PROMPTED RECOVERY CAN'T THE KEY MAN OF THE MATCH IS 
DANNY ORR DANNY ORR CAN'T GRUMBLE 
WITH THAT CARNEGIE CHALLENGE CUP 
MAN OF THE MATCH IS DANNY ORR FOUR MINUTES REMAINING VERY 
CONTENT AND SATISFIED BRIAN 
MCDERMOTT THAT IS GOOD RUNNING FROM LIAM HIGGINS THE DEFENCE HAS CERTAINLY PICKED UP IN THE SECOND HALF SUPERBLY RUNNING FROM SHARIFF IT IS ANOTHER TRY A LOVELY PASS BY 
RANDOLPH LOVELY LITTLE PASS THE THE ROUT IS COMPLETED THIS SECOND HALF 
HARLEQUINS SUPERB FORTY MINUTES THEY 
MIGHT WELL BE A FEW SMILES AROUND 
NOW GREAT RUNNING AS WELL WATCH THIS LITTLE FLIP PASS GREAT LITTLE HAND FOURTEEN NIL DOWN AT HALF TIME AND THEN 
SEVEN TRIES WITHOUT REPLY TERRIFIC 
SECOND HALF PERFORMANCE NO PROBLEM FOR THAT TWO POINTS 
CERTAINLY FOURTEEN 
GOOD RUNNING 
HARLEQUINS HAVE PLAYED AT MANY 
VENUES IN THE TWENTY EIGHT YEARS EXISTENCE 
HERE IN LONDON L. AM SURE THEY 
WON'T MIND RELOCATING TO WEMBLEY 
FOR ANOTHER DAY IN LATE AUGUST WE 
WERE THERE FOR THE CHALLENGE CUP 
FINAL IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHEN THE DRAW FOR THE 
FIFTH ROUND IS MADE ON TUESDAY THEY 
WILL HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF THE 
PROSPECTS THIS IS SCINTILLATING RUGBY THEY ARE RUNNING WILD NOW A LITTLE ALTERCATION BETWEEN A SHENTON AND WORRINCY THERE IS THE HOOTER AN AMAZING 
PERFORMANCE FROM HARLEQUINS 
AMAZING PERFORMANCE SECOND HALF 
THEY PICKED THE TEMPO UP AND 
TOTALLY DOMINATED A RESOUNDING WIN 
THEY WERE GOING TO TOMORROW WITH 
LOT OF CONFIDENCE 
SEVEN TRIES TO 
TWO THAT TELLS THE TALE L. THINK YOU HAVE BRIAN MCDERMOTT THERE 
HOW DID YOU TURN IT AROUND THE THE BOYS KNEW THE FIRST HALF WAS A BIT 
ROPEY AND ADDRESSED THE ISSUES WE 
HAVE LOT OF SMART PLAYERS IN THE 
TEAM A LOT OF CREDIT TO THE 
PLAYERS IN THIS ONE ADDED ADDED CASTLEFORD KEEP ON TOP OF YOU IN 
THE FIRST HALF HOW DID 
CASTLEFORD 
CASTLEFORD ARE A GOOD CASTLEFORD TEAM THEY HAVE TAKEN THE SKIN OFF 
THE TOP TWO TEAMS IN THE SUPER 
LEAGUE AND TROUBLED MOST PLAYERS 
WITHOUT TRYING TO SOUND TOO 
ARROGANT I AM NOT SURPRISED WE 
WERE UNDER THE PUMP A LOT OF 
CREDIT TO OUR PLAYERS FOR TURNING 
IT AROUND 
IS THIS EXTRA SPECIAL 
FOR THE X. CASTLEFORD PLAYERS 
IT IS 
EXTRA SPECIAL THE WAY THAT WE CAME 
BACK 
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY MATCH THE 
CLICHES SOMETIMES COME TRUE A TALE 
OF TWO HALVES SEVEN TRIES FOR 
HARLEQUINS IN THE SECOND HALF IT 
IS NOT OFTEN YOU SEE A SIDE GIVE 
ANOTHER SIDE A FOURTEEN POINT START AND 
THEN SPANK THEM DANNY ORR WAS MAN 
OF THE MATCH 
WELL DONE A DRAMATIC TURNAROUND 
MCDERMOTT HAD A WORD WITH US AT 
HALF TIME WE PUT THE LITTLE THINGS 
RIGHT IN THE SECOND HALF WE GOT 
FEW GOOD KICKS THE POINTS CAME ON 
THE BACK OF THAT 
WERE YOU 
SURPRISED THE WAY CASTLEFORD 
STARTED 
NOT REALLY THEY HAVE BEEN STARTED PUSHING SIDES VERY CLOSE IN THE 
LEAGUE IT IS WIN OVER A GOOD 
TEAM WE HAD A HARD WIN AND HAS 
OFFERED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AT 
CASTLEFORD 
DID HE MEAN EXTRA TO CASTLEFORD YOU AS A CASTLEFORD LAD 
A NOT 
REALLY I WANT TO WIN EVERY GAME 
YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING TO RAVE 
REVIEWS THIS YEAR DO YOU HAVE ONE 
EYE ON THE WORLD SAT 
INTERNATIONAL SELECTION IT IS 
WORLD CUP YEAR 
IT HAS NOT CROSSED 
MY MIND YET THERE IS A LOT OF 
RUGBY TO BE PLAYED FIRST MAN OF MAN OF THE MATCH WELL DONE JON WELLS IS 
HERE DEVISE YOUR VERDICT 
A GREAT 
SECOND HALF PERFORMANCE FROM US A 
VERY STIFF TEST FROM CASTLEFORD L. 
THOUGHT WE HAD THE EDGE IN FITNESS 
AND COMPOSURE IN THE SECOND HALF 
ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF THE SECOND 
HALF TO KEEP OUR FEET ON THE PEDAL 
IT SHOWED HOW PROFESSIONAL WE CAN 
BE 
IT WAS A TALE OF TWO HALVES BE WHAT DID THE COACH SAY AT HALF 
TIME 
IT WAS VERY RESTRAINED FOR TIME BRIAN HE THOUGHT OUR DEFENCE WAS 
PRETTY GOOD AND IT WAS CASTLEFORD 
DESERVEDLY WENT IN AHEAD AT HALF 
TIME WE KEPT PLAYING LIKE WE KNEW 
WE COULD AND GOT THE RESULT WERE WERE YOU SMACKING YOUR LIPS AS SOON AS 
THE DRAW WAS MADE FACING YOUR 
FORMER CLUB 
IN HIS DIFFICULT IT 
IS A PROFESSIONAL SPORT YOU PULL 
YOUR JAUZION AND REPRESENTS THE 
TEAM YOU PLAY FOR L. LIKE TO SEE 
CASTLEFORD DO WELL IT IS A NO WIN 
SITUATION WE HAVE ECHELON WE DO 
THE JOB WE ARE PROFESSIONAL 
JON WELLS SPENT FIVE YEARS WITH 
CASTLEFORD AND DANNY CASTLE DANNY 
ORR IS CASTLEFORD BORN AND BRED 
FOR CASTLEFORD IT WILL BE LONG 
DRIVE HOME YOU FEEL FOR THEM THEY 
PLAYED SO WELL IN THE FIRST HALF 
DEFENSIVELY THEY DID NOTHING WRONG 
IN ATTACK THEY MADE THE MOST OF 
THEIR OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SECOND 
HALF THEY NEVER GOT SNIFF THEY THEY BECAME FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE IN 
DEFENCE AND ATTACK HARLEQUINS 
THEY CARRIED THE BALL HARDER AND 
WENT FORWARD BELTING A FEW OF THE 
CASTLEFORD PLAYERS EVERY TIME 
SHERWIN TRIED TO KICK THE BALL HE 
HAD A CHEQUERED JUMPERS CHASING HIM 
DOWN THE MOMENTUM CHANGED 
COMPLETELY 
THE TEAM BONDING AND COMPLETELY BEARD GROWING DID NOT WORK HE 
SNEEZE YOU JUST HEARD WAS FROM 
JONATHAN DAVIES WE WILL HAVE A 
QUICK LOOK AT ALL SEVEN TRIES THEY 
CAME THICK AND FAST WE COULD 
BARELY TAKE THEM IN FIRST THE 
PASS FROM HENRY PAUL 
THEY STARTED 
THE GAME SO WELL IN THE SECOND HALF 
HENRY PAUL MAKES THIS TRY NOT 
DEFENDED TOO WELL THEY LEFT THE 
SPACE FOR MARK WORRINCY FULL 
CREDIT TO HENRY PAUL A SMART PLAYER LIKE RANDALL WILL 
FIND THE SPACE TO RUN AROUND THEM 
THEY CAN'T GET TO THE DEFENDER ONE ONE OF THE REASONS DANNY ORR ONE MAN OF 
THE MATCH WAS HIS KICKING ABILITY 
THIS KICK ACROSS TO TONY CLUBB GAVE 
THEM THEIR THIRD TRY IN ABOUT TEN 
MINUTES 
IT IS FIVE ONTO THERE MINUTES WERE ONLY TWO DEFENDERS PICKED OUT 
THERE FIVE ON TWO 
DANNY ORR 
TURNED FROM A KICK INTO SCORER FOR 
HIS NINETY EIGHT CAREER TRY 
IT WAS THE 
SITUATION AROUND THE RUCK THEY 
WERE JUST TOO QUICK DANNY ORR 
SCORED THE TRY WOULD THESE KICKS 
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN WITH THAT 
THESE KICKS THIS IS JUST A 
MISMATCH FACTORY AGAINST GARETH 
HAGGERTY WHO IS A BIGGER LUMP AND 
PUMMELS HIM OVER THE LINE FACTORY 
THACKERAY 
THERE WAS A BIT OF 
EVERYTHING A BIT OF THOUGHT 
FINESSE AND SHEER POWER 
THEY DID 
NOT LOOK COMFORTABLE AND AT THE 
HIGH BALL CONDITIONS WERE POOR FOR 
THE WINNERS AND THE FULLBACK IN 
THE SECOND HALF WHATEVER BRIAN 
MCDERMOTT TOLD THEM HE SAYS 
ENRIQUE THEY CERTAINLY LISTENED 
IT LAID THE PLATFORM FOR THE HALF 
BACKS COMPREHENSIVE WINNERS IN THE 
END THEY SCORED TWO QUICK TRIES 
YOU COULD SEE THE HEADS DROP 
I AM WITH HARLEQUINS IN THE 
VICTORIOUS HARLEQUINS DRESSING ROOM 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO MY BIG 
BROTHER HENRY A GREAT GAME GOOD 
WIN APPARENTLY THIS IS THE FIRST 
TIME YOU HAVE HAD YOUR SHARE TOSS 
BEFORE I HAVE YOU CAN STOP TENSING 
UP NOW IT SEEMED TO BE A GAME OF 
TWO HALVES WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 
FIRST HALF 
CASTLEFORD WERE ALL 
OVER RUSS WE COULD NOT GET MUCH 
BALL THE PRESSURE WAS ON US WE 
JUST HAD TO SUCK IT IN AM LIMITING 
THEM TO FOURTEEN POINTS WAS PRETTY GOOD 
WHAT DID BRIANA DEREK SAY AT HALF 
TIME BRIAN MCDERMOTT 
HE TOLD US 
NOT TO PANIC HE WANTED TO SEE A 
BIT OF COMPOSURE WE DID THAT AND 
GUYS LIKE DANNY ORR WERE AWESOME 
TODAY OUR FORWARDS REALLY TO CLOSE 
FORWARD 
ANOTHER EIGHTY MINUTES OUT FORWARD THERE HOW HAS THE BODY FEELING

LOT OF YOUNG GUYS NOW MY JOB IS TO 
GET THE GUYS AROUND ME AND GO

SUPER LEAGUE HOW IS SALFORD 
FANTASTIC 
EVERYONE IS REALLY FANTASTIC ENJOYING THEMSELVES IN THE CHANGING 
ROOM ROOM THEY THINK WE WILL INTERRUPT THEIR 
MUTUAL ADMIRATION SOCIETY L. LIVE 
MATCH WILL FEATURE BOBBY IN ACTION 
TOMORROW FROM SALFORD FEATURE 
ROBBIE 
WHAT DO CASTLEFORD TO DO NOW TO 
PICK THEMSELVES UP AFTER THAT THEY THEY ARE OUT OF ONE COMPETITION AND 
BOTTOM OF THE LEAGUE L. THINK THIS 
YEAR IS JUST TO ESTABLISH 
THEMSELVES BACK IN THE BIG DIVISION 
IN THE SUPER LEAGUE IT IS THE 
INTENSITY EVERY WEEK THEY HAVE NOT 
HAD A REST THIS WEEK IN THE 
CHALLENGE CUP THEY GOT ANOTHER 
SUPER LEAGUE TEAM WHO WORRY PRETTY 
GOOD TEAM WELL COACHED AND WELL 
DRILLED TERRY MATTERSON WILL PICK

MISSING TODAY WATCH OUT THEN NEXT 
SUPER LEAGUE OPPONENTS HE WILL GET 
THEM TOGETHER IT IS IMPORTANT THEY 
STICK TOGETHER YOU CAN FEEL THE 
CHANGE IN ATMOSPHERE IN THE 
DRESSING ROOMS 
I TRIED TO GET OUT OF THE CHANGING 
ROOM BUT GARETH HAGGERTY GRABBED 
ME BACK YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU REALLY 
ENJOYED YOURSELF WHAT WERE YOU 
DOING ON THE WING WHEN YOU SCORED 
YOUR TRY DID YOU ENJOY YOURSELF L. 
HAVE GOT EIGHT TRY SCORING 
COMPETITION WITH YOUR HENRY AT THE 
MOMENT HE THINKS HE IS A BIT OF 
CENT OF THESE DAYS YOU COME FROM 
SALFORD CAME FROM SALFORD LAST 
YEAR ANY WORDS FOR THE BOYS UP 
THERE 
I WISH THEM WELL L. HOPE THERE THEY DO WELL HOPEFULLY WE WILL GET 
THEM THE NEXT ROUND 
BACK TO YOU IN 
THE STUDIO 
A ROBBIE IS SETTING 
HIMSELF UP FOR A FALL IF THEY DO 
GET THROUGH 
LOOKING TO TOMORROW HAVE SALFORD 
GOT A CHANCE OF CAUSING AN UPSET 
AGAINST WAKEFIELD 
ABSOLUTELY THEY 
HAVE THE TALENT IN THE TEAM THEY 
WERE IN SUPER LEAGUE LAST YEAR 
THEY HAVE EVERY EVERY CHANCE BUT 
THEY WILL HAVE TO BE GOOD HOW HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP THAT MATCH 
TONIGHT 
CONDITIONS FAVOURED TONIGHT CASTLEFORD IN THE SECOND HALF AND 
HARLEQUINS IN THE SECOND AND THEY 
USED THEM WHEN YOU PLAY AGAINST 
THE WIND IT IS DIFFICULT YOU TRY 
TO GET POINTS ON THE BOARD WAS FOURTEEN 
ENOUGH BUT TWO QUICK TRIES AND AS 
A KICKER IT IS VERY DIFFICULT WHEN 
YOU ARE IN YOUR OWN TWENTY METRE AREA 
AND THE FORWARDS ARE NOT GOING 
FORWARD THE KICK IS VERY DIFFICULT 
YOU UNDER PRESSURE FOR THE WHOLE FORTY 
MINUTES ONCE THEY WENT IN FRONT 
THEY CLUTCHED IT 
WE WILL HAVE MORE 
TIME TO ANALYSE THIS ON INTERACTIVE 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MATCH TOMORROW WHO WHO KNOWS WE DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT 
THEM WE WATCH THEM AGAINST 
GATESHEAD WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE 
ARE IN SHAPE MENTALLY AND WE SHOULD 
BE O. K. 
YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET 
ANOTHER HAND ON THIS 
BUT WE DON'T 
TALK IT TALK ABOUT IT OR TOUCH IT 
UNTIL IT GETS A BIT NEARER 
IF IT 
IS ONE MATCH AT A TIME IT IS THE 
NEXT STEP FORWARD FOR HARLEQUINS 
IT WAS A DULL GREY EVENING IT WAS 
DIFFICULT WITH THE BALL WET 
CONDITIONS AND GREASY BUT THE 
MULTI COLOURED HARLEQUINS SET THIS 
MATCH ALIGHT IN THE SECOND HALF 
WITH SEVEN TRIES THEY ARE THE ONES 
WHO PROGRESS WE WILL SEE YOU 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND LEAVE YOU 
WITH THIS
