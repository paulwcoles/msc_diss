THE FORMER HONORARY POLICE OFFICER 
JAILED FOR SEXUAL ASSAULTS ON 
CHILDREN IN JERSEY IS THIS PART OF 
THE ISLAND'S CULTURE OF 
CONCEALMENT 
TONIGHT ANOTHER STORY OF 
PAEDOPHILIA ON JERSEY THIS TIME 
FROM A FORMER HONORARY POLICE 
OFFICER OFFICER AS JERSEY'S POLICE CONTINUE THEIR 
INQUIRIES ABOUT A CHILDREN'S HOME 
WE'VE A SPECIAL REPORT FROM THE 
ISLAND 
ROGER HOLLAND WAS A ISLAND CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER YET FOR 
SEVEN YEARS HE KEPT HIS POSITION 
AS AN HONORARY POLICEMAN IN JERSEY 
AND KEPT ON OFFENDING HOW ON EARTH 
COULD IT HAPPEN 
THE LOCAL COUNCIL THAT USED ANTI 
TERROR LAWS TO SPY ON A FAMILY OVER 
THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL APPLICATION 
CAN IT EVER BE JUSTIFIED 
AND UNRAVELLING D. N. A. FOR USE AS 
CRIMINAL EVIDENCE THE 
CONTROVERSIAL METHOD WHICH FAILED 
IN THE OMAGH BOMB TRIAL IS BACKED 
BY SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS

GOOD EVENING FOR WEEKS POLICE 
TEAMS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO UNCOVER 
THE SECRETS UNDER A CHILDREN'S HOME 
IN JERSEY AMID LURID TALES OF CHILD 
ABUSE STRETCHING BACK YEARS NOW 
THE ISLAND HAS BEEN HIT BY A NEW 
STAND SCANDAL INVOLVING A 
PAEDOPHILE WHO ONCE WORE A POLICE 
UNIFORM HE HAS BEEN JAILED FOR 
SEXUAL ASSAULTS ON YOUNG GIRLS 
ROGER HOLLAND AGED FORTY TWO WERE 
SENTENCED TO TWO YEARS IN PRISON 
AFTER PLEADING GUILTY TO THREE 
CHARGES OF INDECENT ASSAULT ON 
UNDER AGED GIRLS AND ASKING FOR A 
SORT ON FIVE OTHERS TO BE TAKEN 
INTO ACCOUNT TWO WERE EIGHT YEARS 
OLD HOLLAND WAS ALREADY CONVICTED 
ON THREE OTHER SUCH CHARGES AND WAS 
JAILED IN TWO THOUSAND ONE UP AFTER FAILING TO 
COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE 
SECTORS SEX OFFENDERS' CLINIC 
PERHAPS WHAT IS MOST DISTURBING IS 
THAT ROGER HOLLAND WAS ELECTED A 
MEMBER OF JERSEY'S HONORARY POLICE 
DESPITE A CONVICTION FOR INDECENT 
ASSAULT AND DESPITE A SERIES OF 
WARNINGS HE WENT ON TO ASSAULT A 
NUMBER OF OTHER CHILDREN 
WHEN I 
FIRST READ ABOUT THIS AND LEARNT 
ABOUT ROGER HOLLAND BEING MADE AN 
HONORARY POLICEMAN A SELF 
CONFESSED PAEDOPHILE AND THEN WAS 
SWORN IN BY THIS WILLCOCK I WAS 
JUST FLABBERGASTED AS WHAT A LOT 
OF PEOPLE IN JERSEY BY THIS 
ROYAL COURT 
JOSIE IS UNUSUAL IT 
IS PART OF THE BRITISH ISLES BUT IT 
IS NOT PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM 
A JERSEY IT HAS ITS OWN 
DISTINCTIVE JUSTICE SYSTEM 
INCLUDING BE UP HONORARY POLICE 
ONE OF THE OLDEST POLICE FORCES IN 
THE WORLD THEY HAVE VOLUNTEERS WHO 
ON PAPER BUT HAVE CONSIDERABLE 
POWER INCLUDING IN SOME CASES THE 
REST THEY ARE ELECTED BY THEIR 
DIFFERENT PARISHES IN THE ISLAND 
WHO ARE THREATENED WITH FINES IF 
THEY DON'T ELECT ENOUGH HOLLAND 
WAS ELECTED IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO ALTHOUGH SIX 
YEARS EARLIER HE HAD BEEN CONVICTED 
ON AN INDECENT ASSAULT ON A FOURTEEN 
YEAR OLD GIRL WITH A MENTAL AGE OF 
A TEN YEAR OLD BRIAN INVESTIGATED 
THE CASE BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX YEARS LATER 
BRIAN DUFFY WAS HORRIFIED TO FIND 
HE HAD BECOME A MEMBER OF THE 
VOLUNTARY POLICE AND WARNED THE 
AUTHORITIES 
I CAME OUTSIDE AND SAW AUTHORITIES HE WAS AN HONORARY POLICEMAN AND 
HE WAS ISSUING A PARKING TICKET FOR 
MY CAR BEING PARKED ON THE PAVEMENT 
TO MY AMAZEMENT I RECOGNISED ROGER 
HOLLAND WHO WAS NOW AN HONORARY 
POLICEMAN 
HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT POLICEMAN THAT 
WELL AMAZED IMMEDIATELY I THAT WENT TO THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS L. 
SAID WHAT IS GOING ON HOW IS THIS 
GUY AN HONORARY POLICEMAN NOTHING 
NOTHING WAS DONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE 
NOTHING WAS DONE 
THEY SIMPLY 
IGNORED THE FACT 
THEY NEVER 
ACKNOWLEDGED HAVING TAKEN ANY 
ACTION 
THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER ACTION EARLIER WARNINGS TO THE AUTHORITIES 
BUT HOLLAND HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO 
REMAIN IN THE HONORARY POLICE 
QUESTION BY A COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY 
INTO HOLLAND AND ELECTION 
PROCEDURES SIX YEARS AGO THEY THEN 
ATTORNEY GENERAL ANSWERED THAT HE 
THOUGHT THAT THE MAGISTRATE MUST 
ANSWER THAT HOLLAND'S ORIGINAL 
OFFENCE WAS CLEARLY NOT VERY 
SERIOUS BECAUSE IT RESULTED IN A 
PROBATION OFFICER SAID HE WAS 
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE AND IN DECEMBER 
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WAS RE ELECTED BUT HE WAS 
STILL A PAEDOPHILE PREYING ON YOUNG 
GIRLS WAYNE ROUSSEAU WORKS 
WORKED ALONGSIDE HOLLAND IN APRIL 
NINETEEN NINETY NINE HE WAS ON DUTY WHO WHEN HE 
WAS APPROACHED BY A YOUNG GIRL I I WAS ON DUTY WITH A COLLEAGUE LATE 
ONE NIGHT IN TOWN AND A YOUNG GIRL 
OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN APPROACHED 
MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUE AND ASKED 
IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE SEX 
IN THE BACK OF A POLICE VAN SHE 
PERSISTED THIS WAS NORMAL PRACTICE 
FOR A POLICE OFFICER AND SHE NAMED 
ROGER HOLLAND AS A PERSON SHE 
REGULARLY HAD SEX WITH IN THE BACK 
OF THE SAINT HELLIER POLICE VAN IN IN MAY NINETEEN NINETY NINE WAYNE ROUSSEAU SENT A 
LETTER TO THE HEAD OF THE SAINT HELIER 
HONORARY POLICE THE MATTER WAS 
SLOWLY REFERRED UPWARDS TO THE 
BOSS OF POLICE THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL AND THEN THE SOLICITOR 
GENERAL GENERAL ROGER HOLLAND REMAINED IN THE 
HONORARY POLICE AND IT NOW SEEMS 
CONTINUED TO OFFEND EVEN AFTER 
WAYNE ROUSSEAU'S MORNING HE WAS 
NOT SUSPENDED UNTIL AUGUST NINETEEN NINETY NINE 
WARNING THE COURT WAS TOLD ABOUT 
EIGHT GIRL ASSAULTED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND 
THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND SHE HAS SINCE 
SUFFERED FROM PANIC ATTACKS AND 
DEPRESSION A GIRL 
MY REACTION 
WHAT CAN I SAY AND NEVER TRUSTED 
HOLLAND FOR VARIOUS REASONS 
FRIENDS OF MINE HAVE HAD HARM DONE 
TO THEM SO IT UPSETS ME 
THE TWO THOUSAND TWO 
INQUIRY INTO THE HONORARY POLICE 
PROCEDURES MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS 
THAT HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED NEW 
PROCEDURES HAD BEEN INTRODUCED FOR 
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE STILL NO SEX 
OFFENDERS' REGISTER IN JERSEY IT 
IS EXPECTED THAT A DRAFT LAW WILL 
BE DEBATED IN THE SUMMER EVEN SO 
THE TIMING OF TODAY'S SENTENCING IS 
EMBARRASSING FOR THE JERSEY 
AUTHORITIES OVER THE PAST FEW 
WEEKS THERE HAD BEEN CONTINUING 
ASSAULTS ALLEGATIONS OF ASSAULTS 
BEATINGS AND PERHAPS MURDER HERE AT 
HAUT DE LA GARENNE WHICH IS STILL 
BEING INVESTIGATED IN A MAJOR 
INQUIRY ROGER HOLLAND IS NOT 
CONNECTED WITH THE ALLEGED HORRORS 
THAT TOOK PLACE POLICE ARGUE IN 
JERSEY TONIGHT THERE IS A 
CONNECTION BUT DESPITE THE REFORMS 
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THERE IS STILL 
A CULTURE OF CONCEALMENT NOT 
WANTING TO PUBLICISE EVENTS THAT 
MIGHT DAMAGE JERSEY'S IMAGE I I THINK THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN 
THESE ISSUES THE TRADITIONAL 
ESTABLISHMENT THE OLIGARCHY OF 
JERSEY AND ALWAYS HAVE A PRIME 
CONCERN WHICH IS SIMPLY 
MAINTAINING THE IMAGE OF THEMSELVES 
AND THE ISLAND OF BEING EVERYTHING 
IN THE GARDEN IS ROSY TO START 
ACTUALLY PUTTING UP THE PRIORITIES 
THINGS LIKE SEX OFFENDERS' REGISTER 
AS AND THESE GROWTH FAILINGS IN 
CHARGE PROTECTION DOESN'T LOOK TOO 
NICE SO THAT WORRIES THEM TONIGHT TONIGHT ROGER HOLLAND IS STARTING HIS 
LATEST SENTENCE FOR SEX OFFENCES 
I ASKED THE JERSEY SENATOR SENATOR 
STUART SYVRET WHAT HE MADE OF THE 
CASE 
I THINK IT IS AN CASE EXTRAORDINARY CASE THIS MAN WAS A 
CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER BEFORE HE 
WAS SWORN IN AS AN HONORARY POLICE 
OFFICER THAT WAS CLEARLY A GROSS 
FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM HE IS A 
REPEAT OFFENDER AND THE SENTENCE HE 
HAS GOT TODAY TWO YEARS HE IS 
FRANKLY PITIFUL THIS MAN CONTINUES 
TO POSE IN RISK TO CHILDREN AND I'M 
AFRAID IT IS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE 
ISLAND'S APPROACH TO AUTHORITY 
ISLAMIC ANY EXCUSE FOR A MAN WHO IS 
A CONVICTED IS THERE ANY EXCUSE 
FOR A MAN WHO WAS A CONVICTED SEX 
OFFENDER TO BECOME A POLICE 
OFFICER 
WE DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE OFFICER CHECKS IN THE ISLAND AND THEY DID 
NOT WORK 
I WONDER GIVEN WHAT YOU 
ARE SAVING UP WITH THE PAEDOPHILIA 
IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY IN JERSEY YOU 
DON'T EVEN HAVE A SEX OFFENDERS' 
REGISTER 
THAT IS CORRECT WE HAVE REGISTER NO SEX OFFENDERS' REGISTER 
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE WON IN PRINCIPLE 
AGREED THERE IS THAT ONE YET AND I 
THINK THAT REPRESENTS THE ILL 
JUDGED PRIORITIES OF THE ISLAND'S 
AUTHORITIES AND ESTABLISHMENT 
CLEARLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE 
WHOLE CHILD PROTECTION DISASTER IN 
JERSEY IS A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN IN 
EFFECTIVE CHECKS WE DON'T EVEN 
HAVE AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY OR AN 
INDEPENDENT CROWN PROSECUTION 
SERVICE WE REALLY HAVE TO ADDRESS 
THESE ISSUES 
HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE 
DO YOU HAVE IN THE CHANGES THAT ARE 
UNDER WAY AND WHETHER THEY CAN 
PREVENT ANY OF THESE THINGS 
HAPPENING AGAIN 
WHY I AM NOT AT 
ALL CONFIDENT AT THE MOMENT THAT 
THE PROPOSED CHANGES WILL WORK 
WHAT WE NEED IS SOMETHING MORE 
DRAMATIC BY JERSEY STANDARDS AS 
EXPECTED IN OTHER COUNTRIES FOR A 
VERY LONG TIME SUCH AS THE PROPER 
SEPARATION OF POWERS AN 
INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY INDEPENDENT 
PROSECUTORS THESE ARE THE CHANGES 
WE NEED THEY JERSEY ESTABLISHMENT 
AS IT WERE WILL NEVER VOLUNTARILY 
AGREE TO INTRODUCE THESE THINGS 
WHICH IS WHY I HAVE WRITTEN TO JACK 
STRAW ASKING THAT HE USE HIS 
CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS TO INTERVENE 
AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE PROPER 
ROLE OF LAW AND A GOOD 
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN JERSEY 
HOW MUCH TROUBLE IS ALL THIS 
CAUSING TO THE PEOPLE YOU ARE 
TALKING ABOUT AT THE TOP OF JERSEY 
SOCIETY WE HAVE HEARD THE CLICHE 
A CULTURE OF CONCEALMENT DO YOU 
THINK THAT IS TRUE 
I THINK THE 
ISSUES ARE CAUSING A TREMENDOUS 
AMOUNT OF DIFFICULTY FOR THE 
ISLAND'S CUSTOM REAP RAWLING 
ESTABLISHMENT MOST PEOPLE IN THE 
COMMUNITY ARE UTTERLY APPALLED BY 
WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE THE ISLAND'S 
ESTABLISHMENT HAVE TRADITIONALLY 
WORKED VERY HARD TO MAINTAIN A 
VENEER OF RESPECTABILITY OVER 
EVERYTHING THAT HAS CLEARLY BEEN 
RIPPED AWAY WE ARE SEEING THE 
UNDERBELLY OF WHAT GOES ON IN 
JERSEY AND A FAILURE OF THE 
AUTHORITIES TO SAVE GOT THE 
COMMUNITY 
SENATOR STUART SYVRET COMMUNITY THANK YOU 
MOST PARENTS KNOW THE PRESSURES TO 
FIND THE RIGHT SCHOOL FOR YOUR 
CHILD INCLUDING BEING IN THE RIGHT 
CATCHMENT AREA AND SOME EDUCATION 
AUTHORITIES ARE WORRIED WHETHER 
SOME PARENTS ATTEMPT TO CHEAT 
POOLE BOROUGH COUNCIL HAS DONE 
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IT HAS 
USED ANTI TERROR LAWS ALL RIPA TO 
KEEP TABS ON ONE FAMILY SUSPECTED 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN CHEATING THEY 
WEREN'T CAN SUCH SPYING EVER BE 
JUSTIFIED 
IF YOU ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE 
BRITAIN IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING A 
SURVEILLANCE SOCIETY THERE WAS 
GRIST FOR YOUR MILL TODAY WITH 
DEVELOPMENTS IN POOLE DORSET 
WHERE THE LOCAL COUNCIL HAS 
ADMITTED USING ANTI TERRORIST 
LEGISLATION TO SPY ON A FAMILY OVER 
THE PLACE AT A PRIMARY SCHOOL FOR 
THEIR THREE YEAR OLD 
ANY POLICE 
FORCE 
ACCORDING TO CAMPAIGNERS FORCE LIBERTY NO FEWER THAN THREE SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
AGENCIES ARE ALLOWED TO SNOOP ON 
US LILLIPUT PRIMARY SCHOOL IS 
THE APPROPRIATELY SWIFTIAN SETTING 
FOR THE TALE OF A AUTHORITY GETTING 
TOO BIG FOR ITS BOOTS COUNCIL 
STAFF TURNED GUMSHOES TO SPY ON A 
FAMILY FOLLOWING A TIP OFF THAT 
WEREN'T LIVING IN THE CATCHMENT 
AREA 
IT'S A HUGE INVASION OF AREA PRIVACY THEY COULD HAVE ASKED FOR 
UTILITY BILLS AND KNOCKED ON THE 
DOOR THEY ASKED FOR OUR DRIVING 
LICENCE AND TOOK DETAILS OF OUR 
CAR NUMBER PLATE AND USED THAT TO 
UNDERTAKE THE STKPAILANCE THIS IS 
A VERY SERIOUS SURVEILLANCE TO 
UNDERTAKE WHEN THE SURVEILLANCE IS 
ON MINORS 
UNDERTAKE WHEN THE SURVEILLANCE IS ON MINORS 
TAKE WITH SOMEBODY 
ON MINORS TAKE WITH SOMEBODY WATCHING YOU WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW IF 
THEY ARE POLICE CHECKED THE THE COUNCIL USED THE INVESTIGATORY 
POWERS ACT RIPA WHICH ALLOWS THEM 
TO 
WE ENDEAVOUR TO DO OUR BEST TO BE 
FAIR TO THE MAJORITY OF PARENTS 
AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO DO THINGS 
LIKE THIS VERY DO IT VERY VERY 
RARELY ONLY THREE TIMES OVER SIX THOUSAND 
ADMISSIONS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS 
HAVE WE GONE TO THESE LENGTHS DO 
ADMIT IT SEEMS EXTREME ACTUALLY IN 
COMPLICATED CASES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE 
TWO HOMES ONE WITHIN THE CATCHMENT 
AREA AND ONE OUTSIDE IT'S VERY 
DIFFICULT TO BE CLEAR 
THE FORCE 
COMPLIEDSING THE SPECIAL CONSTABLES 
ONE CRITIC OF THE ROLE ROLL 
OUT OF RIPA TO MANY AGENCIES SAYS 
THE ACT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN USED 
IN THIS CASE 
THERE MAY BE MANY 
PEOPLE WHO WILL THINK ACTUALLY IT'S 
WORSE TO INTRUDE 
FAMILY WITH A 
FAMILY WITH A YOUNG CHILD IN THIS 
MANNER THAN ANY FIB THAT MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN TOLD ABOUT A CHILD'S HOME 
THIS IS A THREE YEAR OLD KID GOING 
TO SCHOOL IN SEPTEMBER LET'S 
REMEMBER WHAT SOCIETY WE DON'T 
WANT TO CREATE A SOCIETY WHERE 
STHRTION SUCH A PUNITIVE OPPRESSIVE 
CONTEMPT FOR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN 
WHERE EVERY CITIZEN BECOMES A 
SUSPECT SUSPECT SOME MIGHT ARGUE THAT THE STORY OF 
LILLIPUT'S SCHOOL WAS BEYOND THE 
IMAGININGS OF THE CURRENT CROP OF 
SURVEILLANCE DRAMAS IT'S THE LAW 
MAKERS AT FAULT ACCORDING TO HENRY 
PORTER 
I THINK WE'RE SEEING THE PORTER LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES 
ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE TOUGHER 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE LEGISLATION AND 
THE TOUGHER TERRORIST LEGISLATION 
WE HAVEN'T REALISED WHAT A GREAT 
FRAMEWORK OF OPPRESSIVENESS THIS IS 
BUILDING AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD 
THERE HASN'T BEEN WERE ATTENTION IN 
PARLIAMENT PAID TO THE PRIVACY ACT 
IN THESE THINGS THE POINT OF 
PRIVACY IT 
APOLOGIES FOR THE EARLIER LOSS OF 
SUBTITLES SUBTITLES WHAT IS THE CASE FOR THE COUNCILS 
PLAYING JAMES BOND ON TRIVIAL CASES 
LIKE THIS 
COUNCILS HAVE POWERS TO 
CARRY OUT SURVEILLANCE AND MOST OF 
THE TIMES THEY ARE USED FOR 
DETECTING BENEFIT CHEATS AND ROGUE 
TRADERS AND DODGY BUILDERS IT IS 
UNUSUALLY TO BE USED IN A CASE LIKE 
THIS BUT NOT UNHEARD OF IT 
IS IT 
ADVICE YIABLE WHAT IS THE LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION VIEW ON THIS 
OUR VIEWS IS THE COUNCILS HAVE TO 
ABIDE BY THE LAW AND YOU SHOULD 
ONLY USE THESE POWERS WHEN THEY ARE 
NECESSARY AND PROPORTIONATE YOU 
CARRY OUT ALL THE NECESSARY CHECKS 
REQUIRED AND IT IS NOT THE KIND OF 
THING YOU DO WILLY NILLY 
THEY GOT 
IT COMPLETELY WRONG IN THIS CASE 
THE COUPLE DID NOTHING WRONG ON ON THE THREE CASES THAT POOLE USED IT 
ON TWO OF THEM THEY DID FIND THEY 
WERE BOGUS APPLICATIONS 
NOBODY HAS 
BEEN PROSECUTED 
YOU WOULD NOT WANT 
TO PROSECUTE YOU WOULD DENY THE 
CHILD A PLACE AT THE SCHOOL THAT'S 
WHAT THE PARENT WAS TRYING TO I 
CHEEFR 
CASES LIKE THIS D. V. D. CHEEFR PEDESTRIAN WILLING AND CLOCKING OF 
CARS COUNCILS NEED THE POWERS 
COUNCILS NEED POWERS BUT RIPA 
POWERS BUT IN THIS CASE QUITE 
EXCESSIVE INTERESTING THIS WAS 
DONE WITHOUT INTENTION TO 
PROSECUTE IT MAKES THE LEGALITY OF 
IT VERY VERY DUBIOUS COUNCILS ARE 
ONLY SUPPOSED TO USE THE POWERS FOR 
THE DETECTION AND PREVENTION OF 
CRIME THE BASIS SEEMS TO BE 
UNDERMINED 
THERE'S A LOT MORE OF UNDERMINED IT GOING ON IT'S A MAJOR IRRITANT 
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ABIDE BY THE 
RULES AND IN SOME OF THE CASES 
PEOPLE ARE MAKING BOGUS 
APPLICATIONS 
WHENEVER RIPA RIB APPLICATIONS YA POWERS WERE GOING THROUGH 
PARLIAMENT I'M SURE THE GOVERNMENT 
WHEN PUTTING THE CASE SAID THAT 
THE INVASIVE MEASURES WERE 
NECESSARY FOR FIGHTING TERRORISM 
AND ORGANISED CRIME AND DRUG 
SMUGGLING I DON'T VERY MUCH THEY 
MENTIONED CATCHMENT AREA FIDDLING 
THE PROBLEM IS AUTHORISING LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES THEY CAN AUTHORISE 
THEMSELVES TO USE THESE POWERS SO 
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SELF 
AUTHORISE THE EXTREMELY INVASIVE 
POWERS 
THAT'S THE CORE 
IT IS POWERS PARENTS THEMSELVES WHO ARE 
DEMANDING THAT THE COUNCILS POLICE 
THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS ASSERTIVELY 
PARENTS WORRY THEIR CHILD IS GOING 
TO LOSE OUT BECAUSE OTHER PARENTS 
ARE PULLING A FALSE ONE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT DEMANDING THIS KIND OF 
INTRUSION INTO MUM AND DAD AND THE 
KIDS 
NO BUT THEY WANT CASES KIDS INVESTIGATED IF THEY HAVE HEARD 
THAT SOMEBODY CLAIMS THEY ARE 
LIVING IN A ADDRESS THEY ARE NOT 
THEY WANT IT INVESTIGATED COUNCILS 
HAVE TO USE MECHANISMS TO DO THAT 
ONLY IF IT'S NECESSARY AND THEY 
CAN SHOW AND OTHER MECHANISMS CAN'T 
GIVE THEM THE INFORMATION THEY WANT 
ARE THEY ALLOWED TO USE THE POWERS 
IT'S BASICALLY FAIR 
IT STILL HAS 
TO BE PROPORTIONATE YOU CAN SAY 
THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO USE WHATEVER 
MEASURES YOU THINK ARE APPROPRIATE 
TO ENSURE THAT ONLY PEOPLE LIVE IN 
A CATCHMENT AREA ARE APPROPRIATE 
BUT IT'S WHAT IS APPROPRIATE WHAT WHAT DECIDES THAT 
THE COUNCIL IS 
SUPPOSED TO DECIDE THIS THIS IS 
WHY AT LIBERTY WE SAY THIS INVASIVE 
SURVEILLANCE NEEDS TO HAVE 
INDEPENDENT AUTHORISATION JUDICIAL 
AUTHORISATION IF APPROPRIATE THEY 
CAN SAY YOU NEED TO FIND OUT ABOUT 
THE CATCH THE AREAS BUT YOU'RE 
USING TOO EXCESSIVE POWERS PEOPLE PEOPLE SAY I DON'T GET MY BINS EMPTIED ON 
TIME WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU ON 
THIS 
I UNDERSTAND THESE ARE THIS SERIOUS POWERS AND SHOULD ONLY BE 
USED IN SERIOUS CASES COUNCILS 
ABIDE BY THE LAW IF YOU WERE TO 
CHANGE THAT TO HAVE THE INDEPENDENT 
THORGZISATION COUNCILS WOULD BE 
HAPPY TO ABIDE BY THE SYSTEM WE 
HAVE TO WORK WITH THE SYSTEM 
PARLIAMENT HAS GIVEN US IS IS LIBERTY'S BIG POINT A MISSION 
CREEP IN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE START 
WITH VERY GOOD IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE 
CAN SOLVE VARIOUS PROBLEMS 
INCLUDING TERRORISM AND THEY GET 
BIGGER AND BIGGER AND WE'RE 
STUMBLING INTO SOMETHING WE DON'T 
WANT 
THAT GOES TO THE HEART OF THE WANT PROBLEM THERE'S A NEED FOR 
INVESTIGATORY POWERS SO PROPER 
LEGISLATENATE IMPORTANT 
SURVEILLANCE OF CRIME PARTICULAR 
CIEMING CAN TAKE PLACE THIS SORT 
OF INCIDENT HUGELY UNDERMINES 
PUBLIC CONFIDENCE WE'RE SAYING 
THIS BYZANTINE LAW IT'S 
PHENOMENALLY COMPLEX IT WAS BUILT 
AROUND EXISTING STRUCTURES RATHER 
THAN LOOKING AT THE BEST NO 
EFFECTIVE WAY OF AUTHORISING AND 
MAKING ACCOUNTABLE IF YOU 
INTRODUCE AUTHORISATION BY A JUDGE 
AND SIMPLE IF I THE SYSTEM YOU'LL 
HAVE A BETTER SYSTEM 
DO YOU BUY 
THAT WE'RE SLEEPWALKING INTO 
SOMETHING POTENTIALLY THAT NOBODY 
WANTS INCLUEING THE COUNCILS 
COUNCILS ALWAYS WANT TO ACCIDENT 
ACT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE 
COMMUNITIES THEY HAVE TO BE 
ACCOUNTABLE ELECTORALLY U. THEY HAVE 
TO JUSTIFY WHAT THEY DO TO THE 
PEOPLE WHO VOTE THEM IN AND OUT 
THE CLEARER IT WOULD BE ANOTHER ANOTHER COUNCIL WOULD NOT DO IT IN A HURRY 
I IMAGINE THEY WOULD DO IT 
CAREFULLY 
PEOPLE LIE ABOUT THEIR CAREFULLY RELIGIOUS AFFILIATIONS TO GET INTO 
SCHOOLS 
IN THAT CASE THE SCHOOLS ADMISSIONS AUTHORITY IS THE 
FOUNDATIONS SCHOOL AND COUNCILS 
DON'T HAVE THE SAME DUTY OF PATROL 
ON POLICING IN THOSE MATTERS IN IN FAITH PLAERTS YOU ARE ALLOWED TO 
BELIEVE WHAT WE BELIEVE AND SAY 
WHAT WE SAY 
THE PERSON TO BELIEVE 
IS THE LOCAL VICKOR 
OR A HIGHER 
AUTHORITY 
OUR SCIENCE EDITOR BROKE THE D. N. A. 
STORY LAST YEAR WHAT LED TO THE 
REVIEW 
THIS TECHNIQUE SOMETIMES REVIEW CALLED TOUCH D. N. A. IS CONTROVERSIAL 
IS SOMETIMES CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE 
IT INVOLVES COPYING UP BENEFIT 
AGAIN AND AGAIN D. N. A. TAKEN FROM A 
TUM OF COUPLE OF CELLS 
SCIENTISTS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE USE OF THE 
TECHNIQUE IT WAS SUMMED UP BY THE 
PROFESSOR ALEC JEFFREYS THE 
INVENTOR OF D. N. A. FINGERPRINTING HE 
SAID WHERE IT'S USED AS AN 
INVESTIGATION TOOL IT HAS POTENTIAL 
BUT HE WAS MORE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH 
IT BEING USED AS EVIDENCE IN CASES 
THEN CAME THE CASE OF SEAN HOEY 
THAT CASE COLLAPSED JUSTICE WEIR 
DELIVERED A BLISTERING ATTACK AND 
CALLED 
OF THE FORENSIC SCIENCE SERVICE 
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE CONSULTED FOR 
THE REVIEW ONE OF THE LEADING 
CRITICS TOLD ME HE WAS NOT THEY 
WERE WORRIED THEY WERE STILL NOT 
QUAUPBTD FINDING D. N. A. IN SAMPLES 
THEY HAVE A LIST THEY WANT THE 
REGULATOR TO DO IN A WAY OF 
COLLECTING SAMPLES IN A WAY THAT 
WON'T BECOME CONTAMINATED AND A 
NATIONAL STANDARD TO INTERRUPT THE 
RESULTS FROM THE PROFILES THE THE SCIENCE ITSELF IS FITTED FOR 
PURPOSE THERE ARE ASPECTS IN THE 
CRIME SCENE AND THE LABORATORY THAT 
WE HAVE DRAWN ATTENTION TO THAT THAT POINT OF SPWREPGS GOES TO THE HEART 
OF THE 
WORRIES OF 
THE TECHNIQUE 
THE REPORT SAYS IT WANTS JURORS TO 
BE TOLD OF THE WEAKNESSES IT SAYS 
IT IS OUR OPINION ANY LOW TEMPLATE 
D. N. A. PROFILE SHOULD ALWAYS BE 
REPORTED TO THE JURY WITH THE 
CAVEATS 
REPORTED TO THE JURY WITH THE CAVEATS 
HOW FAR DOES THAT SETTLE HOW FAR 
IS EVERYBODY HAPPY 
THEY ARE NOT 
HAPPY ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS WHO 
ORIGINALLY VOICED CONCERNS SAID 
AGAIN TODAY HE'S WORRIED ABOUT HOW 
THE DATA ARE INTERPRETED 
AGAIN TODAY HE'S WORRIED ABOUT HOW THE DATA ARE INTERPRETED 
SOME 
PROFILES ARE QUITE CLEAR AND 
UNAMBIGUOUS IN THE AREA THAT LOW 
COPY NUMBER WORKS IT IS AN AREA 
WHERE THE SAMPLING PROCESS CAUSES 
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS AND I AMONG 
OTHERS AM CERTAINLY NOT CONVINCED 
THAT WE KNOW HOW TO IDENTIFY THOSE 
PROBLEMS AND TAKE ACCOUNT OF THEM 
NOW WHEN WE SPOKE TO PROFESSOR 
JAMIESON HE WAS WORRIED BECAUSE IN 
SOME OF THE CASES HE WAS INVOLVED 
IN HE HAD TROUBLE GETTING THE RAW 
DATA AND THE REVIEW SAID EVEN 
THOUGH HAD PROBLEMS GETTING THE 
DATA FROM THE IS F. S. S. THEY URGED 
SCIENTISTS TO BE MUCH MORE OPEN 
ABOUT THE TECHNIQUE SO THEY COULD 
EARN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE 
TECHNIQUE AND THE WAY IT'S USED BY 
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM ON OUR WEBSITE 
YOU CAN WATCH SUSAN'S ORIGINAL 
INVESTIGATION INTO LOW COPY D. N. A. 
FROM NOVEMBER LAST YEAR IN A 
MOMENT NEWSNIGHT REVIEW THE 
HEADLINES A HIGH COURT JUDGE HAS 
RULED THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE 
PROTECTED BY HUMAN RIGHTS 
LEGISLATION EVEN IN COMBAT AND 
SENDING THEM INTO BATTLE WITHOUT 
EQUIPMENT COULD BE A BREACH OF THE 
LAW DES BROWNE SAID THE RULING WAS 
DATED BECAUSE THE PROBLEM HAD NOW 
BEEN ADDRESSED 
A MAN WHOSE BROTHER DIED AFTER 
RAMMING A BURNING CAR INTO THE 
TERMINAL BUILDING AT GLASGOW 
AIRPORT HAS BEEN JAILED FOR EIGHTEEN 
MONTHS SABEEL AHMED ADMITTED 
HOLDING INFORMATION FROM POLICE 
BECAUSE OF TIME ALREADY SERVED HE 
WILL BE DEPORTED TO INDIA ALMOST 
IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY BRITISH AIRWAYS HAS POSTPONED PLANS 
TO MOVE TO TERMINAL FIVE THE AIRLINE 
SAYS IT NEEDS UP UNTIL JUNE TO 
IMPROVE STAFF TRAINING THERE'S 
POLITICAL STORY ABOUT POSTAL VOTES 
DEVELOPING TONIGHT OUR POLITICAL 
EDITOR HAS THE DETAILS 
THE LATEST 
PROBLEMS HAVE OCCURRED IN ALL 
PLACES THE CORPORATION OF LONDON 
WHERE THEY HELD A BY ELECTION ON 
WEDNESDAY AND FARRINGDON AND ONLY 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE PEOPLE VOTED IN THE BY ELECTION 
THE WINNING MARGIN WAS TWENTY SEVEN 
YESTERDAY SIXTY TWO POSTAL VOTES TURNED UP 
LATE THAT'S FAR FAR MORE THAN YOU 
WOULD NORMALLY GET YOU WOULD 
NORMALLY GET ONE OR TWO IN A WARD 
THAT SIZE SOURCES AT THE 
CORPORATION SUSPECT THAT POSTAL 
VOTES MIGHT HAVE BEEN WITH HELD BY 
THE POST OFFICE BECAUSE THERE WAS 
A DISPUTE EARLIER IN THE WEEK AS TO 
WHETHER THE CORPORATION HAD BEEN 
PAYING THE FREE POST BILL THE POST 
OFFICE INSISTS THAT CAN'T BE THE 
CASE THEY WOULD NEVER DELIBERATELY 
WITH HOLD POST THE QUESTION IS 
WHETHER THE POSTAL VOTES WOULD HAVE 
MADE A DIFFERENCE GIVEN THE MARGIN 
IS ONLY TWENTY SEVEN BY LAW THE CORPORATION 
IS NOT ALLOWED TO OPEN THEM AND 
COUNT THEM IT SHOWS THE PROBLEMS 
OF POSTAL VOTING IS FAR FROM SORTED 
AND THIS ON THE DAY THAT A FIFTH 
MAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED OVER THE 
RECENT POSTAL VOTE FRAUD IN SLOUGH 
BRIEFLY THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY 
SMALL CASE AND PRESUMABLY IT IT WILL GO ON IT WILL PROBABLY END UP 
IN COURT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE 
WHAT THEY DO NOW THEY WILL HAVE TO 
REHOLD THE BALLOT THE SIXTY TWO VOTES 
THEY WERE TOO LATE AND CAN'T BE 
COUNTED 
I HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT TOMORROW
