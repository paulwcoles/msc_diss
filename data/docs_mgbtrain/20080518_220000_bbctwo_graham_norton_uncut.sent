WE WERE SHOCKED THERE WERE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THERE 
WE WEREN'T EXPECTING IT I DON'T KNOW 
I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT PART

AH THAT WAS THEY DECIDED ON THAT ONE THAT IF WE DID A PREMIERE 
YOU KNOW HOW YOU WERE SURPRISED BY THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN LEICESTER SQUARE 
THEY FELT IF THEY'D DONE IF FOR OUR FILM 
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY FEWER PEOPLE IN LEICESTER SQUARE THAN NORMAL 
NOW ON THE NIGHT OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS A LOT OF FOCUS ON WHAT YOU WERE WEARING 
YES THERE OFTEN IS 
HERE YOU ALL ARE YOU KIND OF WON THE OLD FASHION THING DIDN'T YOU 
NO COS EVERYONE WAS LIKE YEAH YOU LOOKED THE BEST THAT'S VERY NICE 
YOU LOOKED FANTASTIC THANK YOU 
OOH HELLO 
NOT PARTICULARLY IN THAT SHOT BUT

I WAS THINKING HAD YOU ALL PHONED SARAH JESSICA PARKER TO SAY 
YEAH WE'RE WEARING HATS MAD HATS 
WEAR IT IT'LL BE FUNNY 
GO ON WEAR A HAT WE'VE ALL GOT THEM YEAH 
SHE DID ARRIVE FIRST AND SHE MUST HAVE BEEN ANNOYED WHEN YOU GOT OUT OF YOUR CARS GOING 
WHERE ARE THE HATS 
I SAY HAT 
NOW YOU DON'T ENJOY THIS ATTENTION DAVID PAPARAZZI RED CARPET 
NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED ME HOW I FEEL OR SAID I LOOK BEAUTIFUL 
I DON'T LIKE MY FEW EXPERIENCES OF BEING ON RED CARPETS 
HAS BEEN GOING TO AWARDS DOS AND 
I FIND THEY'RE ONE OF THE MOST UNPLEASANT ENVIRONMENTS I'VE EVER BEEN IN COS EVERYONE 
FIRSTLY YOU ARE TERRIFIED THAT NO ONE WILL KNOW WHO YOU ARE 
YOU WILL BE STOPPED BY SECURITY AND TURNED AWAY 
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED FORTUNATELY 
BUT YOU STAND IN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF PHOTOGRAPHERS 
ALL TAKING IDENTICAL PHOTOGRAPHS AND SCREAMING AT YOU 
SCREAMING DAVID DAVID LEFT DAVID RIGHT LEFT UP DOWN DAVID 
YOU'RE TERRIFIED THAT SOMEONE MORE FAMOUS IS COMING UP BEHIND YOU AND THEY WILL FLATTEN YOU 
YOU THINK WHY DON'T YOU JUST IT ONLY TAKES ONE OF YOU 
I COULD SEND A PHOTOGRAPH 
I'LL PUT ON MY DICKIE BOW GO OUT IN THE GARDEN AND SET THE TIMER 
YOU CAN HAVE THAT SNAP FOR FREE AND YOU CAN ALL FUCK OFF 
YOU MUST FEEL A BIT LIKE THAT 
A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT 
HOW ARE SO MANY LIVING THE NUMBER OF PHOTOGRAPHERS THEY ALL PRESUMABLY PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE 
HOW THEY'RE GETTING IDENTICAL SHOTS OF THE SAME PEOPLE 
ONE SHOT OF ME FROM THIS DIRECTION AND THEN THERE'S A GUY WHO'S GOT IT FROM THERE AND FROM THERE 
THEY ALL THERE'S THE PICTURE EDITOR OF THE DAILY EXPRESS GOING 
I DUNNO I PREFER IT FROM FOUR DEGREES TO THE RIGHT 
IT'S INSANE 
NOW THE PLOT OF THE FILM IS A CLOSELY GUARDED SECRET 
YES WHICH MAKES ME THINK WHAT THE HELL HAPPENS 
IS THERE SOMETHING REALLY SHOCKING IN IT 
IT TURNS OUT EVERYONE'S GHOSTS 
THAT'S QUITE A GOOD ONE ALL ALONG EVERYONE WAS GHOSTS 
NOT JUST THE WOMEN BUT ALL OF NEW YORK IT'S NOT THERE ANY MORE 
IT'S A MASSIVE TWILIGHT ZONE SPIN OFF NO ONE EXISTS 
I KNOW WHAT I FORGOT TO ASK YOU WHY WAS THE 
IT'S NOT THE WORLD PREMIERE IS IT IN LONDON 
WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD MOMENTUM O. K. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME SERIOUSLY 
IS IT SOMETHING WHERE PEOPLE GO THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS YOU'LL BE ASKED 
IF ANYONE ASKS WHY IT'S IN LONDON WE'RE BUILDING MOMENTUM 
WHEN I SAID WHY ARE WE GOING TO LONDON FIRST THEY SAID WE WANTED THE NEW YORK PREMIERE TO HAPPEN 
VERY CLOSE TO THE FILM OPENING AND THE NEW YORK PREMIERE WOULD BE HUGE 
AND ALL THE ACTORS WOULD BE THERE WHEREAS JUST THE FOUR WOMEN HAVE COME TO EUROPE 
AND IT OPENS HERE ON MAY TWENTY EIGHTH 
YES WHICH I DON'T UNDERSTAND EITHER 
BECAUSE IT OPENS IN AMERICA ON MAY THIRTIETH WHICH I DON'T FOLLOW 
O. K. SO IT'S BUT DO YOU USUALLY OPEN MOVIES HERE ON A WEDNESDAY IS THAT 
IT'S A BIG MOVIE NIGHT 
WE OPEN MOVIES ON FRIDAYS 
REALLY DO YOU NOT DO THAT THAT SOUNDS WEIRD TO ME REALLY 
AT THE WEEKEND WHO GOES OUT AT THE WEEKEND 
OH CYNTHIA NO THEY DO USUALLY OPEN ON A FRIDAY 
RIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW THEY ARE TRYING TO GRAB THE MATINEE CROWD 
WHY OPEN MIDWEEK I DON'T KNOW 
THEY'RE TRYING TO BUILD MOMENTUM 
THEY BUILD IT FROM WEDNESDAY AND THEN YOU HAVE SOME MOMENTUM ON THURSDAY 
AND SO BY FRIDAY IT EXPLODES YOU'VE GOT THE IDEA YES 
PEOPLE ARE GETTING STUPIDER AND STUPIDER 
SO YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM MORE AND MORE NOTICE WHEN ANYTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN AT ALL 
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET 
BECAUSE IF YOU TOLD PEOPLE THE PLOT THEY THINK THEY HAVE SEEN THE FILM 
OR THEY MIGHT JUST FORGET BY THE TIME IT OPENS EXACTLY 
AND THOSE MEMORIES WOULD GET MIXED UP WITH MEMORIES OF THEIR OWN LIVES TERRIBLE SHOCKING O. K. 
I LIKE THIS SCENE COS IT'S A REAL PROPER 
COFFEE SHOP YES HERE YOU ARE 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU GUYS HAVE SEX 
SEX MIRANDA PLEASE WHAT 
SHE'S THREE SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS 
I AM FORTY ONE I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS

LET'S JUST NOT USE THAT WORD 
FINE HOW OFTEN DO YOU GUYS 
COLOUR THANK YOU WELL 
I CAN'T COLOUR ENOUGH I'D COLOUR ALL DAY EVERY DAY IF I HAD MY WAY 
I WOULD USE EVERY CRAYON IN MY BOX 
THAT IS THE SOUND OF MOMENTUM BUILDING 
WE ARE AIR LIFTING IN CLIPS AS THE TIME GET CLOSER 
SUDDENLY WE CAN PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER IT'S THE FILM 
RIGHT NOW SEX AND THE CITY RIGHT HAS INTRODUCED ALL OF THESE TERMS 
INTO THE LANGUAGE SO YOU SAY YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH SEX AND THE CITY 
I MUST ADMIT NOT 
I WONDER IF ANY OF THESE TERMS FROM SEX AND THE CITY HAVE REACHED YOUR WORLD 
I DO LIVE ON THE SAME PLANET AS EVERYONE ELSE YOUR WEIRD WORLD 
YOUR ODD SEX AND THE CITY LESS WORLD RIGHT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A TRYSEXUAL IS 
IS THAT MEN WOMEN AND ANIMALS 
SORT OF IT'S SOMEONE WHO WILL TRY EVERYTHING ONCE 
OH SO IT'S TRY AS IN ATTEMPT RATHER THAN THREE YES 
WHAT'S A DARWINIAN 
NO I DON'T KNOW YOU SEE I'M NERVOUS TO SPECULATE 
DO YOU KNOW CYNTHIA 
IT IS SOMETHING ABOUT WHY MEN ARE RELUCTANT TO MARRY 
AND WE ARE WEEDING THEM OUT FROM THE POPULATION 
SO GOOD IT'S A MAN WHO'S OVER THIRTY AND SINGLE BECAUSE HE'S BEEN WEEDED OUT 
FROM PROPAGATING THE SPECIES 
THAT'S THAT'S ME 
ALL RIGHT THAT'S GOOD SO I AM ESSENTIALLY THE DODO 
SO YOU KNOW LOOK AT ME WHILE I'M STILL HERE 
ONE DAY I'LL BE IN PICTURE BOOKS 
NERVE CLICQUOT 
UM SOME CHAMPAGNE SLASH NERVE GAS CROSS BREED 
DO YOU NOT KNOW NERVE CLICQUOT I DON'T KNOW 
NERVE CLICQUOT WOULD BE THE CHUTZPAH YOU HAVE AFTER YOU DRINK CHAMPAGNE 
YES IF YOU'RE TOO NERVOUS TO CROSS THE ROOM TO TALK TO A GUY YOU HAVE SOME NERVE CLICQUOT 
AND OVER YOU GO YOU SEE YES I DO YES 
AND THEN YOU'RE DRUNK AND A BIT OF A SLAG 
VERY GOOD IN THE FILM IS IT YOUR REAL HAIR OBVIOUSLY IT'S YOUR HAIR 
BUT IS IT YOUR ACTUAL COLOUR 
IT IS MY ACTUAL COLOUR 
DID YOU GO RED SPECIFICALLY FOR 
YES FOR SEX AND THE CITY 
DID IT AFFECT YOUR LIFE COS YOU HAD TO HAVE RED HAIR A LOT 
NO I DON'T THINK IT AFFECTED MY LIFE I DON'T THINK HAIR COLOUR NO IT DIDN'T 
EXCEPT THAT WHEN I HAVE MY RED HAIR PEOPLE ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO RECOGNISE ME SO 
WHEN I CAN GET AWAY FROM IT IT'S A GOOD THING 
LOOKING AT HOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE LOOK THERE'S A WEBSITE THAT 
THE UNIVERSITY OF SAINT ANDREW HAVE DEVELOPED 
IT'S A FACE CHANGING WEBSITE YOU PUT A PICTURE OF YOURSELF IN 
AND YOU SEE HOW YOU WOULD LOOK AS A CHINESE PERSON OR AS AFRO CARIBBEAN 
OR OLD OR YOUNG OR 
SHALL WE DO DAVID FIRST OR CYNTHIA FIRST 
LET'S DO DAVID FIRST 
THERE'S DAVID THAT'S YOU NORMAL WOULD YOU AGREE 
I'M IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO SAY

I'M NOT LEAVING THIS CAVE WITHOUT MY LIPSTICK AND EARRINGS 
I TELL YOU THE SEX AND THE CITY PREMIERE WASN'T THE ONLY GLITTERING GLAMOROUS EVENT THIS WEEK NO 
IT WAS ALSO COLEEN MCLOUGHLIN'S HEN NIGHT

HOW YOU SPEND TWENTY THOUSAND ANYWAY 
HERE'S COLEEN LEAVING THE NIGHTCLUB AT THE END OF THE EVENING LOVELY

HANDBAG FULL OF VOMIT 
IT IS BURSTING AT THE SEAMS M. M. M. THAT WAS DINNER 
DURING HER HEN NIGHT COLEEN WORE AN L. ON THE BACK OF HER DRESS 
FUNNY IT'S SIMILAR TO THE L. WAYNE HAS ON HIS LEFT SHOE 
IT'S NOT LONG TILL THE WEDDING ITSELF 
POOR WAYNE HE'S GOTTA MAKE THAT BIG SPEECH 
HE'S NEARLY MEMORISED IT 
I 
DO 
WAYNE AND COLEEN HAVE DECIDED TO GET MARRIED IN ITALY 
PARTLY BECAUSE COLEEN LOVES THE FAIRYTALE ROMANCE OF TUSCANY 
BUT MAINLY BECAUSE WAYNE LIKES PASTA 
HERE'S WAYNE EATING SPAGHETTI 
OH IT DOES LOOK LIKE HIM DAVID IT DOES IT DOES YES 
THAT'S NOT REALLY HIM THAT'S A MONKEY 
SHE'S NOT ACTUALLY MARRYING A MONKEY NO NO 
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT HE'S STUPID 
THAT'S WHAT ALL THIS IS ABOUT YES 
THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MUCH PREPARATION GOING INTO THE WEDDING THEY'RE BUILDING MOMENTUM 
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TALKING OF WEDDINGS 
IS IT A RUMOUR OR IS IT TRUE YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED 
IT IS UNTRUE OH 
WE CAN'T GET MARRIED 
YOU CAN GET BLESSED OR SOMETHING HERE YOU CAN 
WE CAN GET MARRIED FOR PRETEND 
D'YOU KNOW I MEAN WE LIVE IN NEW YORK 
NEW YORK HAS NO SAME SEX MARRIAGE ONE DAY SOON HOPEFULLY IT MAY 
AND THEN I THINK WE'D CONSIDER IT 
IS THERE ONE PLACE LEFT STILL DOING IT 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN STILL DOING IT IT USED TO BE EVERYWHERE 
IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY GAY MARRIAGE IN AMERICA WAS FINE 
YOU'LL SOON HAVE A NICE BIG ELECTION YES AND THAT SHOULD BE GOOD 
CHANGE WELL WE'LL KNOCK ON WOOD I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO GO 
WE'RE OBSESSED AS EVERYONE IN AMERICA IS WITH THE ELECTION 
AND WITH WHO THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE IS GOING TO BE 
WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME MY SON WHO IS FIVE AND A HALF IS TRYING TO KEEP UP 
HE SEES EVERYBODY IS INTERESTED 
WE HAD A TIME MAGAZINE COME TO OUR HOUSE THE OTHER DAY WITH A PICTURE OF BARACK OBAMA 
THAT SAID THE WINNER BECAUSE HE'S GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER 
AND MY SON PICKED IT UP AND SAID LOOK HILLARY CLINTON 
HE CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHICH IS WHICH 
IT IS A SURPRISE IN THE PLOT 
RIPS OFF A MASK AHA IT WAS ME ALL ALONG 
READING ABOUT YOU I DIDN'T REALISE YOU WERE A CHILD STAR 
A CHILD ACTOR PERHAPS MIGHT BE A BETTER 
YOU WERE ON A LIST ON V. H. ONE OF CHILD STARS 
OH THAT'S LOVELY AND IF V. H. ONE SAYS IT IT MUST BE TRUE THANK YOU YEAH 
AND YOU WORKED WITH SARAH JESSICA PARKER BEFORE 
A FEW TIMES WHEN WE WERE KIDS YES SO DID YOU STAY FRIENDS OR IS THAT JUST COINCIDENCE 
NO IT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MY BEING CAST O. K. 
WHEN WE WERE TEENAGERS SHE LEFT TO DO SQUARE PEG SHE WENT TO CALIFORNIA FOR A BIT 
AND WE LOST TOUCH BUT THEN SHE MOVED BACK TO NEW YORK AND DID A PLAY 
I CAME TO THE OPENING NIGHT AND WE STARTED TO KEEP IN TOUCH A LITTLE 
BUT OF COURSE WHEN WE DID THE SHOW TOGETHER WE REALLY STAYED IN TOUCH 
DID YOUR SCHOOLING SUFFER WERE YOU NOT VERY ACADEMIC BECAUSE YOU WERE PURSUING ALL OF THAT 
NO I WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SAVED ME FROM THE CURSE OF 
THE CHILD ACTOR SYNDROME WAS I WENT TO A REALLY A VERY COMPETITIVE JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL 
AND IN FACT WHEN I WAS IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
I WAS IN THE FILM OF AMADEUS WHICH SHOT IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
AND I SAID I WANTED TO DO THE FILM SO MUCH MILOS FOREMAN DIRECTED IT I WAS A HUGE FAN OF IT ON STAGE 
AND I SAID I COULD ONLY DO THIS IF YOU PROMISE THAT I DON'T SHOOT FOR MORE THAN TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS 
YOU'LL FLY ME HOME SO I MADE I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY TRIPS BACK AND FORTH TO CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
TO MAKE SURE I DIDN'T MISS SCHOOL I WAS FLOWN OUT ONE TIME FOR A FORTY FIVE MINUTE REHEARSAL AND FLOWN BACK 
WOW YEAH SIMILAR TO YOUR CHILDHOOD DAVID 
I THINK I GOT ON A PLANE ABOUT FIVE TIMES BEFORE I REACHED THE AGE OF MAJORITY YES 
THE SIMILARITY IS THAT YOU WERE A BIT OF A BRAIN BOX AS A CHILD 
ER I WAS A SWOT YES I WAS GOOD AT LESSONS I SUPPOSE YES 
WERE YOU IN SOME SORT OF GIFTED CHILD THING 
NO 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SO CLEVER YOU GOT MOVED TO BE WITH CLEVER PEOPLE 
THAT WAS ME 
THAT WOULD BE WHY IT'S SIMILAR TO HIM BECAUSE IT'S ALL YOU 
WERE YOU THE ONE WHO THOUGHT YOU LOST INTEREST IN ACADEMIA BECAUSE YOU SUDDENLY THOUGHT 
GOD THESE PEOPLE ARE CLEVERER THAN I'LL EVER BE I'M NOT INTERESTED ANY MORE OR WAS THAT YOU 
I WASN'T IN SEX AND THE CITY 
BUT WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG 
I'M GONNA GET THERE IN THE END DAMMIT IS THIS A NEW FORMAT 
YES WHO IS THIS FACT TRUE OF 
I JUST READ OUT RANDOM BIOGRAPHY THINGS SOME OF THEM WILL BE TRUE 
I WAS VERY TEMPTED TO GO FOR THE WHOLE GIFTED CHILD SEPARATED OUT FOR A SPECIAL BUNKER BY THE MOD 
FOCUSES BRAIN POWER ON MOSCOW EVERYONE MAY DIE 
IN SCHOOL WERE YOU ANY GOOD AT SPORT NO 
NO NO I DON'T KNOW WHY 
WERE YOU SPORTY NO BUT DIDN'T YOU DO FENCING 
OH I DID I WAS I DID HAVE A GYM REQUIREMENT IN COLLEGE 
AND I DID TAKE A SEMESTER OF FENCING SORT OF DISASTROUSLY 
WHY DISASTROUSLY HAVE YOU EVER TRIED IT 
YES I HAVE YOU HAVE YES 
DID YOU ENJOY IT NO IT'S HORRIBLE 
IT'S SORE IT'S YOUR THIGHS 
I MEAN YOU'RE JUST IN A SQUAT FOR HOURS AND HOURS 
NEVER EVEN MIND I NEVER EVEN GOT TO WHAT MY ARMS WOULD BE DOING MY LEGS WERE JUST IN CRISIS 
YES 
THERE'S A LOT OF THAT ISN'T THERE 
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT I GOT AS FAR AS THE MOVING JUST THE STAYING IN PLACE AND TRYING TO DO THIS 
I WAS AT DRAMA SCHOOL WE PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE A PROPER TEACHER 
WE JUST LIKED THE HATS THAT WAS IT WE LIKED WEARING THE HATS 
AND WAVING AROUND BUT LISTEN YOU LIKE FENCING YOU'LL LOVE THIS STORY 
IT'S ALSO GOOD NEWS FOR OUR ELDERLY VIEWERS 
I SAY OUR ELDERLY VIEWERS 
RESIDENTS AT THE CATHOLIC OLD PEOPLE'S HOME 
OF CORPUS CHRISTI IN MELBOURNE FED UP WITH BOWLS DOMINOES AND BINGO HAVE TAKEN UP FENCING 
NOW 
THAT DOESN'T LOOK SAFE 
FIGHTING FOR BISCUITS 
BY THE WAY THIS ISN'T A PICTURE THIS IS LIVE FOOTAGE 
THEY'VE JUST NODDED OFF 
OH YOU WOULDN'T WATCH IT THOUGH EXTREME ELDERLY FENCING 
NOW LOOK AT THIS BOUT 
AH YES VERY GOOD 
SEE HOW THE MAN THERE IS CLEVERLY DISTRACTING HIS OPPONENT BY POINTING OUT THE TIME YES 
HURRY UP IT'S A QUARTER TO DEATH 
THEY KNOW ALL THE TERMINOLOGY 
EN GUARD THRUST PARRY KNIT ONE PURL ONE 
HERE'S ANOTHER FIGHT 
NOW UM 
I THINK SHE'S FISHING I DON'T THINK THAT'S FENCING 
SHE'S EITHER FISHING OR TRYING TO IMPROVE 
THE RECEPTION ON HER TELEVISION 
ONE OR THE OTHER IT SORT OF IT IS IT'S PENSIONERS' FIGHT CLUB 
AS THEY SAY THERE ARE ONLY TWO RULES TO PENSIONERS' FIGHT CLUB 
ONE NO ONE TALKS ABOUT PENSIONERS' FIGHT CLUB 
AND TWO HANG ON WHAT WAS IT AGAIN DORIS 
WHAT ARE WE IN A CLUB ER 
NO IT CAN ACTUALLY BE QUITE VIOLENT 
LOOK AT THIS ONE OW 
ANOTHER TWO FEET LOWER AND THAT WOULD HAVE GONE STRAIGHT THROUGH HER TIT 
I LOVE THAT 
IT SEEMS THE MOST UNLIKELY THING TO ASK ELDERLY PEOPLE TO DO IN THE WORLD 
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE ON PLACES IN THE OLD PEOPLE'S HOME 
HOPING THEY'LL FINISH EACH OTHER OFF 
IN TERMS OF CHILDHOOD AMBITIONS YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE AN ACTRESS 
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO BE 
WELL I WANTED TO BE A NUMBER OF THINGS THROUGHOUT MY CHILDHOOD 
BUT THE YOUNGEST WHEN I WAS ABOUT FOUR I WANTED TO BE A POLICEWOMAN 
REALLY AND YOU'VE NEVER SERIOUSLY PURSUED THAT 
NO ONCE I HAD LEFT SAY FOUR OR FIVE THAT DIDN'T SEEM SO APPEALING ANY MORE 
THAT'S DEPRESSING ISN'T IT AT THE AGE OF FOUR OR FIVE NO 
NOW YOU DID HAVE LOFTY AMBITIONS 
YES DIDN'T YOU WANT TO BE PRIME MINISTER I DID YES 
YOU STILL COULD BE I DON'T WANT TO BE PRIME MINISTER ANY MORE 
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SUCH A GOOD JOB 
I THINK WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER I WAS A MEGALOMANIAC 
I THOUGHT WHO BETTER TO BE IN CHARGE OF EVERYONE THAN ME 
DID YOU RUN FOR SCHOOL OFFICE AND THINGS LIKE THAT NO 
TEACHERS WERE APPOINTED YOU COULDN'T BE VOTED IN 
I NEVER FLATTERED MYSELF AS POPULAR BUT I THOUGHT YOU KNOW 
LOOK AT THE NERDY PEOPLE WHO GET TO BE PRIME MINSTER 
THEY'RE NOT THE POPULAR PEOPLE AT SCHOOL AT ALL ARE THEY NO 
SO I THOUGHT A BOOKISH SWOT LIKE ME MAY ONE DAY BE GIVEN ULTIMATE POWER 
BUT I WENT OFF THE IDEA AT UNIVERSITY 
WHEN YOU MEET OTHER STUDENTS WHO WANT TO BE POLITICIANS 
AND THOUGHT THEY WERE ALL ARSEHOLES 
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I WOULD BECOME A COMPLETE ARSEHOLE IF I TRIED TO DO THAT 
SO DON'T NO DON'T WORRY I WON'T TRY AND RULE US ALL 
THANK GOD I PROMISE 
THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT BEING IN POLITICAL OFFICE 
THE BIG BOOK NEWS IS THAT CHERIE BLAIR HAS PUBLISHED HER MEMOIRS 
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH CHERIE 
SHE'S MARRIED TO TONY YES I WAS GOING TO SAY WAS SHE STILL IS 
HE USED TO BE PRIME MINISTER SHE IS NOT JUST THE PERMANENT PRIME MINISTER'S WIFE 
SHE'S MARRIED TO WHOEVER IS PRIME MINISTER 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE JOB IS YOU GET THIS TERRIFIC WIFE 
SHE WILL TELL EVERYTHING EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU 
AND SHE BELIEVES IN THE MYSTICS AND HAS A TERRIBLY WIDE MOUTH 
SHE'S OTHERWISE A TERRIFIC WIFE CHERIE BROWN 
HERE SHE IS THE EX PRIME MINISTER'S WIFE AT A BOOK SIGNING 
I SAY A BOOK SIGNING AS SOON AS ANYBODY BUYS ONE SHE WILL SIGN IT I'M READY 
I THINK THAT'S A PENCIL 
YOU CAN RUB IT OUT AND IT'S WORTH MORE 
THIS IS FROM THE BOOK THIS IS FROM CHERIE'S BOOK 
I KNOW WHEN WHAT A WEEKEND THAT WAS 
COME ON CHERIE PUT YOUR CAR KEYS INTO THE FRUIT BOWL 
UGH 
PHILIP'S JUST POPPED HIS VIAGRA 
SHE SAID SHE WAS TOO EMBARRASSED ABOUT HER CONTRACEPTIVE EQUIPMENT 
EQUIPMENT WHAT IS IT ROPES PULLEYS BAG FOR HER HEAD WHAT THE HELL IS IT 
YOU DON'T REFER TO IT AS EQUIPMENT EVER DO YOU 
SHE'S CATHOLIC THAT MEANS SHE HAS TO PRAY NOT TO CONCEIVE 
THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED CONTRACEPTION 
MAYBE SHE HAS TO GET THE POPE IN TO SAY O. K. IT'S A ONE OFF GO FOR IT 
HER EQUIPMENT WAS A FOLDAWAY CARDINAL 
WHY BRING CONTRACEPTION JUST LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON 
OR OR DOING THE PROPER CATHOLIC THING 
TONY COULD HAVE PULLED OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE 
OR MAYBE HE WAS WORRIED IF HE PULLED OUT EARLY GORDON BROWN WOULD TAKE OVER AND MESS IT UP 
I JUST WANTED TO TALK ABOUT YOU WERE ALL LIVING THE WORLD OF GLAMOUR 
OF SEX AND THE CITY NEW YORK 
DAVID DOESN'T 
IT'S BIZARRE MAYBE ON PAPER IT SOUNDS WORSE THAN IT IS 
BUT IS IT TRUE YOU STILL LIVE IN AN EX COUNCIL FLAT 
UM YES YEAH YEAH 
YOU MUST BE MAKING QUITE A LOT OF MONEY AND GORDON HAS MADE THE HOUSES NICE AND CHEAP 
THE THING IS I LIVE IN A FLAT I BOUGHT SEVEN YEARS AGO THAT IS FINE 
BUT IT'S MUCH MORE UNPLEASANT THAN WHEN I MOVED IN COS I'VE BEEN LIVING THERE 
BUT THE LAST TIME I MOVED WAS I THINK THE MOST STRESSFUL DAY OF MY LIFE EVER 
AND THE PROSPECT OF MOVING AGAIN IS TERRIFYING 
NOW HOUSES ARE GETTING CHEAPER I'VE GOT ANOTHER EXCUSE NOT TO MOVE 
AND I HATE THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO TAKE PRIDE IN WHERE I LIVE 
IT'S ON THE T. V. THE WHOLE TIME I COULDN'T STAND THIS LIVING ROOM I HAVE TO CHANGE THAT 
WHY ALL YOU NEED IS A ROOF HEATING A T. V. AND A FRIDGE AND YOU'RE SORTED 
WHAT SORT OF SHITHOLE DO YOU LIVE IN 
IT'S NOT THAT BAD IT'S PERFECTLY FUNCTIONAL IS THERE SAWDUST ON THE FLOOR 
NO THERE'S CARPET ON THE FLOOR IT'S FINE BUT THE THING IS 
EVERYONE'S GOT TO GIVE SUCH A MASSIVE SHIT ABOUT THEIR DOMICILE 
WHY IT'S A NICE THING TO SURROUND YOURSELF IT'S NICE 
IF THAT'S YOUR HOBBY FINE BUT WHY IS THERE SO MUCH PRESSURE ON ME 
TO BE BOTHERED TO MOVE AND PAINT THE PLACE AND WORRY ABOUT THAT BIT OVER THE COOKER THAT'S MELTED 
YOU SEE THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER SLOVENLY PEOPLE OUT THERE 
AND WHEN WE GET ROUND TO IT WE WILL SPEAK 
ARE YOU GONNA GO IN THE CELEBRITY VERSION OF HOW CLEAN IS YOUR HOUSE 
ARE KIM AND AGGIE GONNA COME ROUND AND GO OH MY GOD 
HE WOULDN'T LET THEM IN WHY WOULD I PERMIT THAT WHY DOES ANYONE PERMIT THAT 
WHY DOES ANYONE APART FROM THAT THEY DO CLEAN YOUR HOUSE FOR FREE 
I'VE NEVER FELT MY HOUSE IS SO DIRTY THAT I WOULDN'T MIND PUBLIC HUMILIATION TO GET IT CLEANED 
DO IT YOURSELF OR PAY SOMEONE NOT NO I WANT IT FOR FREE 
AND I DON'T MIND THE WHOLE COUNTRY THINKING I'M A SLOB 
NOW LISTEN PEEP SHOW GOES WITH THE SEINFELD THING THERE'S NO HUGGING NO LEARNING IS THERE 
NOT REALLY NO CERTAINLY ANY HUGGING ISN'T REALLY MEANT 
BUT WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT IS IT'S A VERY SPECIFIC LOOK THE WAY PEEP SHOW'S FILMED 
COS IT'S ALL DONE FROM POINT OF VIEW 
AND HOW DO YOU DO THAT IT IS VERY HIGH TECH 
WE USED TO DO A LOT OF IT GENUINELY WITH CAMERAS MOUNTED ON OUR HEADS 
AND WE'D SORT OF WEAR A BICYCLE HELMET WITH A MINI CAMERA ON THE FRONT 
LIKE A MINER YES LIKE A SORT OF YES YES LIKE A MINER 
WE'VE USED THAT LESS AND LESS COS THE FOOTAGE YOU GET FROM A MINI CAMERA STRAPPED TO AN ACTOR'S HEAD 
IS NOT THAT USABLE ALL THE TIME 
SO IN GENERAL WE JUST USE A NORMAL CAMERA THERE'S A LOT OF REACHING AROUND IT 
AND PRETENDING TO LIFT A CUP OF TEA UP TO THE LENS 
IT'S QUITE ODD WHEN YOU'RE CHARACTER'S EATING SOMETHING 
YOU HAVE TO BRING A FORK UNDER THE LENS 
USE YOUR HAND TO REMOVE THE FOOD AND THEN TAKE THE FORK AWAY SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN EATEN 
IT'S KIND OF GROSS YES 
YOU END UP GETTING A BIT OF SAUSAGE IN YOUR HAND THINKING PEOPLE THINK THIS IS A GOOD JOB 
AS A WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS YOU THINK THEY CAN'T KEEP THAT UP 
BUT ACTUALLY WE'VE GOT USED TO IT NOW IT'S 
IT'S QUITE A LOGICAL WAY TO FILM THINGS UNTIL YOU TRY AND DO IT 
WHEN YOU SPEND EVERYDAY WISHING CAN WE NOT JUST FILM IT NORMALLY THIS TIME ROUND 
BUT YEAH 
I ASKED THE BOFFINS HERE AT THE STUDIOS HOW YOU FILMED IT AND THEY BUILT ME THIS THING 
AND APPARENTLY THIS IS CLOSE TO WHAT YOU GUYS USE UGH 
THIS IS HOW YOU FILM THE SERIES 
RIGHT IT IS QUITE TRICKY I TRIED THIS EARLIER IT'S 
IT'S QUITE HEAVY 
IS IT SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
NOT VERY 
NO THAT WOULD GIVE THE POINT OF VIEW OF A PERSON A FOOT AND A HALF TALLER THAN YOU 
LOOKING OVER EVERYONE ELSE'S HEADS 
THAT WOULD BE QUITE DULL FOOTAGE 
WHEN WE DID IT WITH A HELMET WE HAD A VERY SMALL CAMERA THAT WOULD BE MOUNTED AT EYE LEVEL 
AND A LITTLE CYCLE HELMET RATHER THAN THAT PERIOD MOTORCYCLE HELMET 
I FEEL LIKE JAMES BOND 
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE THERE YOU ALL ARE LOOK AT THAT
