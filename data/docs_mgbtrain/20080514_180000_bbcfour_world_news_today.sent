THEIR OWN HAND WRITTEN CARDBOARD 
SIGNS IT'S ALL THEY CAN DO 
WELL BURMA'S MILITARY RULERS HAVE 
BEEN SAYING THAT THEY CAN LOOK 
AFTER THE DISASTER THEMSELVES 
DESPITE PLEAS FROM THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ALLOW 
MORE FOREIGN AID WORKERS IN ACCESS 
TO AREAS WORST AFFECTED BY CYCLONE 
NARGIS REMAINS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT 
FOR FOREIGNERS MEANWHILE THE UN 
SAYS THAT EVEN MORE PEOPLE ARE 
SUFFERING FROM THE CYCLONE THAN 
THEY ORIGINALLY FEARED IT'S 
ESTIMATED AS MANY AS TWENTY FIVE MILLION 
PEOPLE ARE NOW IN NEED OF MEDICAL 
AND HUMANITARIAN HELP THERE ARE 
ALREADY OUTBREAKS OF SICKNESS AND 
DISEASE IT'S FEARED THE NUMBER OF 
DEAD COULD BE MORE THAN DOUBLE THE 
OFFICIAL FIGURE WHICH STANDS AT 
THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL 
HAS CALLED AN EMERGENCY MEETING FOR 
LATER TODAY TO DISCUSS THE 
SITUATION BURMA'S MILITARY 
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN RECEIVING 
INTERNATIONAL VISITORS THAILAND'S 
PRIME MINISTER HAS BEEN ASKING FOR 
VISA RULES FOR RELIEF WORKERS TO BE 
EASED HE WAS TOLD BIT BURMESE 
REGIME THAT WHILE IT WELCOMED AID 
MONEY AND SUPPLIES IT DOESN'T NEED 
ANY EXPERTS IN THE COUNTRY THE 
EUROPEAN UNION DEVELOPMENT 
COMMISSIONER LOUIS MICHEL HAS ALSO 
ARRIVED A FEW HOURS AGO SPEAKING 
ON HIS WAY TO BURMA HE SAID THERE 
HAD BEEN SOME PROGRESS IN GETTING 
AID THROUGH BUT BETTER ACCESS WAS 
STILL URGENTLY REQUIRED 
I 
DON'T ACCUSE 
I DON'T CONDEMN I DON'T JUDGE ANYONE I ONLY SAY I HOPE THAT ACCESS FOR 
HUMANITARIAN AID WILL BE OPENED WE 
HAVE THE FINANCIAL MEANS WE HAVE 
THE HUMAN RESOURCES WE HAVE THE 
EXPERTS WE HAVE THE PROFESSIONALS 
WHO ALL WORK ON THE SIMPLE BUT 
FUNDAMENTAL HUMANITARIAN PRINCIPLE 
IMPAR SHALLALITY INDEPENDENCE 
NEUTRALITY 
TO GET MORE DETAIL ON NEUTRALITY THAT VISIT TO BURMA BY THE E. U.'S 
DEVELOPMENT COMMISSIONER I'VE BEEN 
SPEAK TO HIS SPOKESMAN JOHN CLANCY 
I ASKED WHO THE COMMISSIONER WAS 
HOPE TO ACHIEVE IN BURMA 
OF COURSE 
HE WOULD LIKE TO TRY AND MEET WITH 
THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE 
AUTHORITIES IN THE COUNTRY BUT 
THEN BEYOND THAT HE ALSO WISHS TO 
TRY AND MEET WITH HUMANITARIAN AID 
WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY 
IS HE 
MEETING WITH THE GENERALS OF OF COURSE HE WILL BE MEETING WITH 
OFFICIALS OF THE AUTHORITIES THERE 
AT DIFFERENT LEVELS AND OF COURSE 
AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL POSSIBLE TO 
TRY AND GET A MESSAGE ACROSS WHICH 
IS ONE A OF DIALOGUE TO BUILD 
BRIDGES AND TO TRY AND REALLY 
EMPHASISE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 
AUTHORITIES THERE OPENING UP THIS 
HUMANITARIAN SPACE TO ALLOW IN 
INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS AND THEIR AID 
WILL THE COMMISSIONER BE GOING TO 
THE IRRAWADDY DELTA WHERE THE WORST 
DEVASTATION IS 
OF COURSE HE WANTS 
THAT HIS TRIP IS AS USEFUL AS 
POSSIBLE HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE FOR 
HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN EYES THE 
LEVELS OF DESTRUCTION THAT HAVE 
TAKEN PLACE AND THE CONDITIONS IN 
WHICH THE LOCAL POPULATIONS ARE 
LIVING OF COURSE THAT IS AN 
ONGOING DISCUSSION AT PRESENT WITH 
THE AUTHORITIES WE HOPE THAT CAN 
BE ARRANGED 
WHILE LOUIS MICHEL WAS 
ON HIS WAY OVER FROM THAILAND THE 
THAI PRIME MINISTER WAS ALREADY IN 
BURMA MEETING WITH MEMBERS OF THE 
REGIME THERE AND BEING TOLD THAT 
THEY CAN TACKLE THE PROBLEM BY 
THEMSELVES THEY DON'T NEED OUTSIDE 
EXPERT HELP THAT'S A BIG NO THANK 
YOU ISN'T IT I MEAN WHY SHOULD 
LOUIS MICHEL SUCCEED WHERE THE THAI 
PRIME MINISTER WHO HAS A MUCH 
CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH BURMA 
WHERE HE'S FAILED 
CLEARLY THE 
SITUATION IS DIFFICULT THERE'S 
CLEARLY A LACK AND HAS BEEN A LACK 
OF OPEN DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE 
AUTHORITIES THERE AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WHAT WE 
CAN HOPE IS THAT COMMISSIONER 
MEECHAN BECAUSE THIS IS A 
HUMANITARIAN MISSION AND IS SEEN AS 
A HUMANITARIAN HE'S SEEN AS A 
HUMANITARIAN EVEN IF ONLY SMALL 
STEPS WE HOPE HE CAN CONVINCE THE 
AUTHORITIES THERE THE CRITICAL 
IMPORTANCE 
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT 
THAT HAS BEEN TRIED A NUMBER OF 
TIMES IN THE PAST TEN DAYS THIS IS 
GETTING DESPERATE WHAT ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF THE E. U. USING 
NEIGHBOUR COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA 
CHINA THAILAND AS A COULDN'T WIT 
A GO BETWEEN THESE ARE DESPERATE 
TIMES WOULDN'T BE THAT BE MORE 
REASONABLE THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES 
ARE MORE LIKELY TO DEAL WITH OTHER 
ASIAN COUNTRIES THAN EUROPE AREN'T 
THEY 
THAT'S YOUR POINT OF VIEW OF THEY COURSE WE SUPPORT FULLY THE EFFORTS 
OF REGIONAL COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY 
THAILAND TO BE INVOLVED AND TO TRY 
AND CONVINCE THEM TO OPEN UP TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL AID COMMUNITY BUT 
THAT SHOULDN'T PREVENT COMMISSIONER 
MEECHAN AT A EUROPEAN LEVEL AND 
WITH THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE E. U. TWENTY SEVEN 
MEMBER STATES OF TRYING TO CARRY 
OUT HIS MISSION OF A HUMANITARIAN 
NATURE AS WELL I THINK AT THIS 
STAGE WE SHOULD LEAVE NO STONE 
UNTURNED TO CONVINCE THEM 
HOW DOES 
HE CONVINCE THEM THAT HE'S THERE IN 
GOOD FAITH THAT'S THE TRICKY THING 
IT'S A LOVELY SENTIMENT BUT HOW IN 
PRACTICAL TERMS DOES HE CONVINCE A 
PARANOID REGIME 
WELL IF I CAN TAKE 
YOU UP ON YOUR EARLIER POINT YOU 
SAID PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRYING THIS 
ALREADY FOR THE PAST TEN DAYS I'D 
POINT OUT THAT FROM AN 
INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE 
COMMISSIONER MEECHAN IS THE FIRST 
HUMANITARIAN TO BE ALLOWED INTO THE 
COUNTRY WE THE COMMISSIONER IS 
THE FIRST TO GO IN AND TO HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY OF FACE TO FACE TALKS 
WITH THE AUTHORITIES THERE I THINK 
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP WE HAVE 
TO REMAIN HOPEFUL WE HAVE TO WAIT 
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR 
FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND TO SEE WHETHER HE CAN 
BE SUCCESSFUL IT SHOULD BE NO 
REASON NOT TO TRY 
JOHN CLANCY OF 
THE E. U. COMMISSION TALKING ABOUT 
BURMA THERE 
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH IS IN ISRAEL 
TO MARK ITS SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY AND 
DISCUSS THE WAY FORWARD TORE A 
PEACE PROCESS HE SAYS HE'D LIKE TO 
SEE A DEAL WITH THE PALESTINIANS BY 
THE TIME HE LEAVES OFFICE IN 
JANUARY BUT VIOLENCE HAS ALREADY 
ACCOMPANIED THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT 
ISRAEL SAYS A ROCKET FIRED FROM 
THE GAZA STRIP HAS HIT A SHOPPING 
CENTRE IN ASHKELON EARLIER AT 
LEAST FOUR PALESTINIANS WERE ALSO 
KILLED IN ISRAELI ATTACKS IN GAZA 
ISRAEL'S PRIME MINISTER EHUD 
OLMERT SAID THE PALESTINIANS WERE 
RISKING ISRAELI MILITARY ACTION ON 
A LARGE SCALE 
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY IS ENTIRELY 
TOLERABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE THE 
GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL IS COMMITTED 
TO STOP IT AND WE WILL TAKE THE 
NECESSARY STEPS 
O. SO THAT THIS WILL STOP I'M I'M JOINED FROM THE SCENE OF THE ROCKET 
ATTACK IN ASHKELON BY TIM FRANKS 
TELL US WHAT MORE YOU KNOW ABOUT 
THIS SHOPPING CENTRE ATTACK WE'VE WE'VE JUST COME OUT FROM HAVING BEEN 
INSIDE IN THE SHOPPING CENTRE WE 
WERE TAKEN IN TO THE ROOM WHERE THE 
ROCKET STRUCK THE POLICE WHO TOOK 
US IN SAID IT WAS A MIRACLE THAT 
NO ONE DIED WHEN YOU SEE THE 
DEVASTATION THE ROOF RIPPED OFF 
THE TWISTED SHARDZ OF METAL AND 
CONCRETE INSIDE IT IS EXTRAORDINARY 
THAT NO ONE DIED THE ROOM WAS 
WHERE A MOTHER AND BABY WERE 
WAITING TO SEE A DOCTOR NEXT DOOR 
THAT HAPPENED THREE HOURS AGO WHEN 
WE WENT IN HALF AN HOUR AGO THE 
AIR WAS STILL FILLED WITH DUST AND 
SMOKE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BREATHE 
BUT IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE TO SEE 
THE DEVASTATION THAT WAS WROUGHT 
THREE PEOPLE SERIOUSLY INJURED HERE 
IT CERTAINLY HIGHLIGHTS THE 
DIFFICULTIES THAT PRESIDENT BUSH 
FACES NOW PUSHING ANY PEACE 
PROCESS FORWARD DOESN'T IT THE THE PROBLEM WITH THE PEACE PROCESS IS 
TWO FOLD ONE IS THAT THE 
POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT 
MAKING THE PROGRESS THAT MANY 
DIPLOMATS AND OFFICIALS WOULD LIKE 
TOO SEE THE OTHER IS THAT EVENTS 
ON THE GROUND ARE NOT PARTICULARLY 
PROPIRBS THERE'S ANGER HERE 
CHANTING THAT REFLECTS A MEASURE 
OF DISAFFECTION WHICH IS FELT ON 
BOTH THE ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN 
SIDE THIS IS NOT PARTICULARLY 
FERTILE GROUND IT SEEMS FOR 
PRESIDENT BUSH'S AMBITION OF A 
PEACE DEAL BEING REACHED BY THE END 
OF THIS YEAR 
THANK YOU 
LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE DAY'S 
OTHER NEWS AN ARAB LEAGUE 
DELEGATION MET RIVAL POLITICIANS IN 
LEBANON TOND THE CRISIS THAT'S SEEN 
FIGHTING BETWEEN SUPPORTERS AND 
OPPONENTS OF THE PRO WESTERN 
GOVERNMENT THE DELEGATION INCLUDES 
EIGHT ARAB FOREIGN MINISTERS THE 
CRISIS ERUPLTED AFTER THE 
GOVERNMENT SAID IT WAS OUTLAWING 
HEZBOLLAH'S PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS 
NETWORK NETWORK AUTHORITIES IN THE INDIAN CITY OF 
JAIPUR HAVE CLAMPED DOWN AFTER 
TUESDAY'S BOMB BLAST WHICH KILLED 
MORE THAN SIXTY PEOPLE A DAWN TO DUSK 
CURFEW IN PLACE AND SCHOOLS AND 
GOVERNMENT OFFICES ARE CLOSED 
THE ZIMBABWEAN RUN OFF VOTE TO 
DECIDE THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST IS 
TO BE DELAYED BY NINETY DAYS THE 
INFORMATION MINISTER ANNOUNCED THAT 
ELECTORAL LAWS HAVE BEEN AMENDED TO 
ALLOW THIS IT MEANS THE RUN OFF 
BETWEEN ROBERT MUGABE AND MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI WILL NOW NOT BE DECIDED 
BEFORE THE END OF JULY 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH IS TIGHTENING ITS 
GRIP ON BRITAIN THE GOVERNOR OF 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS DELIVERED A 
GLOOMY ECONOMIC FORECAST SAYING 
CONSUMERS SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR A 
DOUBLE WHAMMY THE COST OF LIVING 
WILL GO UP BUT WAGES WILL BE WORTH 
LESS INFLATION COULD RISE TO 
NEARLY FOUR PER CENT 
IT'S NOT JUST HERE IN THE U. K. AND 
IN AMERICA THAT HOUSE PRICES ARE 
FALLING THE SPANISH HOUSING MARKET 
IS ALSO IN FREE FALL ESTATE AGENTS 
ARE TELLING CUSTOMERS THAT PRICES 
ARE DOWN BY UP TO THIRTY PER CENT AND THIS 
CONTRIBUTE TO A SLUMP RIGHT ACROSS 
THE ECONOMY UNEMPLOYMENT IS RISING 
AND GROWTH IS FALLING AFTER A 
DECADE OF ABOOM WHICH WAS IN PART 
FUELLED BY RISING HOUSE PRICES 
THE WEATHER IS GLORIOUS SPECTRUM SPECTRUM RADIO RECKONS IT HAS A POTENTIAL 
AUDIENCE OF FIFTEEN MILLION SCATTERED 
ALONG THE SPANISH COAST THEY'VE 
BEEN DRAWN BY THE COMBINATION OF 
SUNSHINE A LAID BACK LIFESTYLE AND 
THE BOOMING SPANISH ECONOMY BUT 
THE NEW COMERS ARE THE FIRST TO 
FEEL THE IMPACT OF SPAIN'S ECONOMIC 
SLOW DOWN MAXINE CAN'T GET A JOB 
AND CAN'T PAY HER MORTGAGE HER 
PARTNER DIED LEAVING HER WITH A 
SIX YEAR OLD SON SHE'D LIKE TO 
SELL UP AND GO BACK TO BRITAIN BUT 
SHE CAN'T NO ONE WILL BUY HER 
APARTMENT EVEN AT TWENTY PER CENT LESS THAN SHE 
PAID FOR IT 
THE OTHER OPTION IS TO 
HAVE TO WALK AWAY AND LET THE BANK 
HAVE IT THAT MEANS WE LOSE 
EVERYTHING WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING 
THAT I REALLY WANT TO DO 
HAVE YOU 
THOUGHT OF DROPPING THE PRICE I'VE I'VE DROPPED IT ORIGINALLY IT WAS UP FOR 
SALE FOR TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND EUROS NOW IT'S 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND IT WILL BE DROPPED AGAIN 
TODAY TO TWO HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND 
SPAIN HAS BEEN 
BUILDING TOO MANY HOUSES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A 
YEAR MORE THAN THE MARKET WOULD 
BEAR RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
THERE ARE ROWS OF NEW HOMES WAITING 
TO BE SOLD FOR ESTATE AGENTS THESE 
ARE SLACK TIMES HALF HAVE GONE 
OUST BUSINESS THE REST ARE 
DELIVERING A HARSH MESSAGE TO 
CUSTOMERS CUSTOMERS 
THE PRICES HAVE GONE DOWN FROM THEIR HIGHEST POINT IN 
TWO THOUSAND SIX THEY'VE DECREASED BY THIRTY PER CENT BUT BUT THEY MUST BE VERY RELUCTANT TO CUT 
THEIR PRICES BY THIRTY PER CENT 
NOBODY LIKES TO PUT THEIR PRICES DOWN IF THEY REALLY 
NEED TO SELL THEIR HOUSE THEY KNOW 
THAT IF THEY DON'T PUT THE PRICES 
DOWN THEY WON'T SELL 
THE IMPACT 
IS BEING FELT ACROSS THE ECONOMY 
NEW PROJECTS ARE BEING PUT ON HOLD 
SOME DEVELOPERS ARE GOING BUST THE 
MAIN CONSTRUCTION UNION SAYS 
LAYOFFS AMONG WORKERS ARE 
ACCELERATING AND FEARS SEVERAL 
HUNDRED THOUSAND WILL SOON BE OUT 
OF WORK WITH THE KNOCK ON EFFECT 
ON DEMAND FOR OTHER GOODS AND 
SERVICES EVEN THE FINANCE MINISTER 
SAYS IT WILL TAKE YEARS FOR SPAIN 
TO RECOVER HOW LONG BEFORE YOU 
THINK SPAIN IS CLEAR OF ITS 
DIFFICULTIES 
I CAN SEE THAT WE ARE DIFFICULTIES ABSORBING THE PROBLEMS IN THE 
CONSTRUCTION SECTOR BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
AND TWO THOUSAND NINE IF AND THIS IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT IF IF THE FINANCIAL 
SITUATION IS NORMALISED IN TERMS OF 
LIQUIDITY PROBABLY AT THE END OF 
THE NEXT YEAR IT COULD BEGIN AGAIN 
MORE COMFORTABLE POSITION SPAIN SPAIN HAS BEEN BUILDING MORE HOMES THAN 
FRANCE BRITAIN AND GERMANY 
COMBINED SPANISH HOUSING HAS 
BECOME A MAJOR FORCE IN EUROPEAN 
GROWTH DRAWING PEOPLE HERE BOTH TO 
BUILD THE HOUSES AND THEN TO BUY 
THEM NOW THOSE FLOWS ARE BEING 
REVERSED AND NO ONE'S SURE WHAT 
EFFECT THAT WILL HAVE ON THE WIDER 
EUROPEAN ECONOMY THE SPANISH 
GOVERNMENT IS PUMPING TEN P. L. EUROS 
INTO THE ECONOMY THAT'S NOWHERE 
TEN BILLION EUROS INTO THE ECONOMY 
HOUSING HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR 
TEN PER CENT OF THE SPANISH ECONOMY A 
LEADING FINANCIAL ANALYST SAYS THE 
GOVERNMENT MUST ENCOURAGE OTHER 
SOURCES OF GROWTH 
SPAIN LIKE 
IRELAND U. K. OR NEDGEER LAND HAS 
GROWTH IN THE LAST YEARS BASED ON 
THE REAL ESTATE MARKET NOW THAT'S 
OVER WE HAVE TO DISCOVER NEW 
SOURCE FOR THE ECONOMY I THINK THE 
NEW GOVERNMENT IN SPAIN WILL TAKE 
THE ACTIONS IN NEW SERVICES BUT 
I'M NOT SURE WE CAN FIND THE 
SOURCES FOR THE NEXT YEARS 
IF THE 
BUILDING INDUSTRY IS NO LONGER AS 
SAFE AS HOUSES THAT'S BAD NEWS FOR 
THE FORTY SEVEN BRICK FACTORIES GROUPED 
AROUND TOLEDO THIS MAKES HALF A 
MILLION BRICKS A DAY DEMAND IS 
DOWN BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT AND THE FACTORY HAS TO 
SHUT DOWN FOR TWO MONTHS A YEAR 
FERNANDO THE COMPANY CHAIRMAN 
SAYS THEY'RE STRUGGLING GET 
BUSINESS THEY'LL HAVE TO FIRE 
WORKERS IF IT GETS ANY WORSE IT'S 
AN INDICATION OF HOW A HOUSING 
SLUMP IS A CRISIS AFFECTING REAL 
JOBS AND LIVING STANDARDS NOT JUST 
HOUSE PRICES AND FINANCIAL MA 
MARKETS MARKETS NOW A NEW RECORD HAS BEEN SET ON 
THE NEW YORK ART MARKET PROVING
