I AM A BIT FUSSY BUT MAC AND CHEESE THEY DO THE BEST MACARONI CHEESE OVER IN THE U. S. 
NOT THAT STUFF IN THE PACKET

I THINK YOU'LL BE PROUD OF MY BAG THOUGH I'VE LEARNT A LOT FROM YOU 
TIP IT OUT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT O. K. SO 
M. M. M. 
RED SNAPPER WOW 
VERY NICE THAT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL 
BECAUSE MY FIRST EVER FISH WAS ON THIS SHOW WORKING AS A RESEARCHER SO I HADN'T EATEN FISH OR MEAT FOR TWENTY 
YEARS AND THEN THEY MADE ME EAT FISH AGAIN SO I THOUGHT I'M GOING TO GO FOR IT SO YEAH RED SNAPPER BECAUSE 
I LOVE THE COLOUR AND IT'S A BIT EXOTIC ORANGE PEPPER 
I LOVE IT AND THEN A SHALLOT AND SOME CAULIFLOWER 
HOW MUCH DID THAT COST NINE POINT NINE ONE JUST UNDER THE TEN MARK NICE TO SEE A BIT OF SNAPPER 
OFTEN PEOPLE WANT THAT WHEN THEY GO OUT TO RESTAURANTS BUT OUR CHEF'S 
GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU CAN KNOCK IT UP AT HOME DEFINITELY 
HOW WOULD YOU DO IT IT'S A BIG FISH SO I'M GONNA TAKE THE FILLETS OFF IT 
HALF OF IT WE'RE GONNA PUT THROUGH A BATTER BECAUSE IT'S A MEATY FISH 
AND WILL HOLD REALLY WELL SO IF WE PUT THAT THROUGH A BATTER 
MAYBE POSH FISH AND CHIPS COS YOU'VE GOT PEAS SO YOU COULD DO A PEA PUREE 
YOU COULD TAKE THE POTATO WE CAN ROAST THAT DOWN CHUNKY WEDGES KIND OF THING 
ALSO WITH THE OTHER HALF OF IT INCORPORATING 
I'M GONNA GET ANOTHER TWO BITS OF IT WE COULD DO ERM 
A GARLIC AND HONEY AND PEPPER DRESSING TO GO WITH IT 
MAYBE WITH A HERB SALAD INCORPORATE 
KIND OF LIKE A STIR FRY WITH THE PEAS 
THE REST OF THE SHALLOTS OR PEAS A LA CREME YOU COULD DO WITH IT 
WITH THE SHALLOT AND THE REMAINDER OF THE PEAS CAULIFLOWER 
YOU LIKE MACARONI CHEESE YOU HAVEN'T TRIED MY CAULIFLOWER CHEESE OOH 
YEAH WE DON'T KNOW SOUNDS GOOD SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS 
LET'S HEAR IT FOR NATALIE AND JAMES 
VERY NICE INDEED O. K. YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING NOW WE GIVE OUR CHEFS TWENTY MINUTES 
TO PRODUCE ALL THOSE WONDERFUL DISHES 
LET'S FIND OUT IF IT'S POSSIBLE BY SAYING READY STEADY COOK 
O. K. GET ME THE GARLIC FROM THERE THE ONION FROM THE FRIDGE 
WE'RE GONNA PEEL THOSE AND POP YOUR APRON ON 
VERY NICE HELLO AINSLEY HELLO HOW ARE YOU DOING THERE 
OH I'M GOOD O. K. I'LL PUT THIS UNDER THERE FOR YOU 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN ON THE GREEN SIDE 
DOES THAT EXCITE YOU I FEEL THAT I HAVE LESS TIME THAN USUAL FROM WHEN YOU COME ROUND 
IT MEANS I COME OVER TO YOU STRAIGHT AWAY AS OPPOSED TO GIVING YOU FIVE MINUTES OF BREATHING SPACE 
EXACTLY HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GETTING ON WITH SOMETHING 
I DON'T MIND AT ALL 
IF YOU COULD UNWRAP MY AUBERGINES WHILE WE CHAT I CERTAINLY WILL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE BABY AUBERGINES CHEF 
DO YOU USE THEM IN THE RESTAURANT AT ALL 
I DON'T IN THE RESTAURANT BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE I DO USE THEM VERY OFTEN 
BECAUSE THE THING IS THAT I'LL GET A KNIFE THEN I'LL CHAT IN EARNEST CARRY ON 
THE THING ABOUT THESE IS THAT THEY HAVE 
A LOT OF SKIN TO FLESH AND WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT AUBERGINES 
IS THE FLESH THE CREAMY STUFF ON THE INSIDE 
AND YOU KEEP IT A LOT OF PEOPLE PEEL IT AWAY I THINK THAT LOSES THE CHARACTER 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT SEEING THAT BRIGHT PURPLE 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE DOING ONE OF THOSE THAI STYLE CURRIES 
MY THING IS MEDITERRANEAN FOOD SO I REALLY LIKE THAT 
I LIKE THE WAY THAT THEY SUCK UP OIL YOU SEE AND THE THING IS ABOUT AUBERGINES IS THEY TAKE ON 
THE FLAVOUR OF WHATEVER YOU ADD 
THINK OF THEM LIKE A SPONGE IN TERMS OF TAKING UP FLAVOUR BUT THEY NEED SOMETHING ACIDIC 
ACIDIC IN WHAT SENSE LIME OR LEMON VINEGAR LEMON ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
THAT'S A GOOD TIP ISN'T IT 
ABOUT FOUR CLOVES PLEASE AGGIE DOES THAT COMPLETELY CHANGE THE TASTE 
IT DOES AGAIN IT SUCKS IT UP THIS IS THE IMPORTANT THING AND IT CUTS THROUGH THAT RICHNESS 
BECAUSE THESE TAKE A LOT OF RICHNESS FROM THE OIL 
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME I'M STARTING THEM IN THE PAN O. K. SLICED OR CHOPPED 
SLICED VERY VERY FINELY I'M STARTING IN THE PAN 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO DO THEM AND NOT TAKE UP SO MUCH OIL BRUSH THEM WITH THE OIL BAKE THEM IN THE OVEN 
A LOT OF US WANT THAT REDUCED FAT DON'T WE 
AND WE'VE GOT A LADY HERE AGGIE WE'RE SO USED TO HER CLEANING 
SHE'S ACTUALLY A VERY KEEN GARDENER GROWS A LOT OF YOUR OWN VEG DON'T YOU 
WELL MY HUSBAND GROWS I HARVEST IT YES 
BUT YES ACTUALLY IT'S FANTASTIC THE POTATOES ARE AMAZING THE BEETROOT CARROTS ONIONS BROAD BEANS 
LATER ON WE'LL HAVE A CHAT YOU CAN TELL ME ALL ABOUT WHAT YOU LIKE COOKING FOR YOUR BOYS 
YEAH NOW DO YOU WANT HOT WATER IN THERE YOU WANT STOCK STRAIGHT AWAY THAT'D BE LOVELY 
WHAT'S THIS FOR ALEX 
WHAT'S THAT FOR THAT'S FOR MY CHOCOLATE SAUCE SO THIS IS A 
SORT OF A MEXICAN THING BY ORIGIN AND USUALLY THE CHOCOLATE YOU USE HAS GOT ABSOLUTELY NO SUGAR IN IT 
IT'S JUST COMPLETELY BITTER CHOCOLATE SO IT GIVES A LOVELY FLAVOUR TO THE GAME 
AND HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TOO MUCH LIKE PROFITEROLES 
I'M GOING TO BOIL THAT STOCK DOWN FINISH IT OFF WITH SOME BUTTER AND CHOCOLATE AND WE'LL SEE HOW WE GO 
O. K. LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT O. K. THAT'S A LITTLE BIT UNEVEN THERE I THINK I JUST NEED TO 
SWAP THESE ROUND A TOUCH THAT'S IN THE WRONG PLACE THERE 
WAS IT IT WILL START TO KIND OF WOBBLE AROUND A LITTLE BIT YOU DON'T WANT THAT DO YOU 
NO BECAUSE I'M WOBBLING AROUND ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US REALLY 
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE VEGGIE GARDENING WITH AGGIE I'M A KEEN VEGGIE GARDENER 
AND I DID SOMETHING I WANT TO RECOMMEND TO EVERYBODY THAT CHANGED MY GARDENING LIFE 
I PUT RAISED BEDS IN OH THEY'RE FANTASTIC RAISED BEDS IT'S FANTASTIC I ABSOLUTELY AGREE 
COME ON THEN GUYS RAISED BEDS JUST THE THING 
WHAT HAPPENS WITH A RAISED BED THEN AGGIE 
WELL YOU CAN JUST SECTION EVERYTHING OFF IT'S MUCH NEATER AND TIDIER 
AND YOU CAN GET LOADS OF LOVELY COMPOST IN THERE AND IT'S SUCH A NICE THING TO DO 
YOU COULD ADD RICHNESS TO THE SOIL CAN YOU 
YES AND IT SEEMS TO AND YOU DON'T WALK ON THE SOIL THAT'S RIGHT IT SEEMS TO HOLD IT IN BETTER 
THERE YOU GO ALL THE GARDENERS IN THE AUDIENCE THINKING I'M GOING TO RAISE ME BEDS 
THANKS TELL US BRIEFLY 
A GREAT IDEA WITH COUSCOUS IS TO BOIL UP STOCK WITH SOME GINGER 
GARLIC ANY SPICES YOU LIKE POUR THAT OVER THE TOP SO INSTEAD OF JUST COUSCOUS FLAVOURED 
WITH SOMETHING ROUND THE OUTSIDE IT SUCKS UP ALL THOSE FLAVOURS 
LOVELY I HAVEN'T DONE THAT BUT IT'S A GOOD IDEA I KNOW I LIKE THE IDEA 
HE'S A GREAT MAN FOR SUCKING UP FLAVOURS WHETHER IT'S AUBERGINE OR COUSCOUS 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE OLD SNAPPER 
AND INDEED CAULIFLOWER WHAT'S GOING ON 
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN WONDERING 
HOW I'M GOING TO DO CAULIFLOWER CHEESE SO AM I BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOT ANY CHEESE 
BUT I AM GOING TO DO A GLAZE OVER THE TOP AND IT WILL HAVE A SIMILAR TASTE 
BECAUSE A WHITE SAUCE WITH THE CHEESE IN AND THE FAT OBVIOUSLY GIVES YOU A CHEESY WHITE TASTE 
I'M REDUCING BLACK PEPPER CREAM GARLIC 
MY SECRET INGREDIENT DIJON MUSTARD 
THAT'LL GIVE US THE FLAVOUR 
WOW WE NEED TO ENRICH THAT AND CREATE A GLAZE ON TOP 
YOU CAN PUT IT UNDER THE GRILL BUT I'M GOING TO ENRICH IT NOW IT'S BUBBLING AND REDUCED 
TAKE IT OFF THE HEAT LEAVE IT FOR TWO MINUTES OR SO THEN WHISK INTO IT AN EGG YOLK 
AND THAT CREATES A GLOSS AND A GLAZE LIKE A SABAYON 
PUT THAT OVER BLANCHED CAULIFLOWER 
NOT SEASONED BECAUSE THE CREAM IS AND IT'S A STRONG FLAVOUR 
THAT GOES OVER THE TOP INTO THE OVEN IN THE MEANTIME 
EXCITING ISN'T IT OOH 
WE'VE GOT THE SHALLOTS GARLIC PEPPER 
NOW AT THIS STAGE WE PUT IT IN NOW 
IF WE'D PUT IT IN EARLIER IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK ON US 
DO YOU NEED ANOTHER JOB DON'T WORRY ONE'S GOING TO BE ON THE WAY 
I'VE SEPARATED AN EGG O. K. SQUEEZE SOME HONEY IN THERE FOR ME 
WE'VE GOT SOME SAUTE POTATOES AND I'VE ALSO GOT SOME CHUNKY POTATOES 
I'VE PUT A LITTLE BIT OF GARLIC IN HERE 
BUTTER ADDS THE COLOUR YOU CAN FINISH THESE IN THE OVEN 
I'LL FINISH IT WITH FLAT LEAF PARSLEY ADD A BIT OF RICHNESS TOO CHEF WITH THE OLD BUTTER 
YES DEFINITELY LOVELY O. K. 
NOW THIS IS BUBBLING UP YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BURN 
BUT WE WANT TO ADD A BIT OF SMOOTHNESS TO IT 
IN WITH A KNOB OF BUTTER 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS NATALIE I CAN'T WAIT I'M SALIVATING 
THIS IS A WONDERFUL HOT DRESSING WORKS WELL WITH FISH WITH LAMB 
ADD YOUR OIL TAKE IT OFF THE HEAT USE THE HEAT OF THE PAN TO SHAKE THE BUTTER 
DO YOU WANT TO SHAKE THAT FOR ME THAT'S IT GET YOUR HIPS MOVING 
GOOD GOOD DO AN AINSLEY DO AN AINSLEY THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE 
SHE LEARNT A LOT WHEN SHE WAS WORKING WITH ME 
NOW I WANT YOU TO PUT IT INTO THAT BLITZER BOWL IN HERE 
PLUG THIS IN DOWN AT YOUR END IF I CAN GET IT OUT JUST PUT IN THERE 
YEAH BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IT'S VERY HOT 
TAKE YOUR FINGERS OUT THE WAY 
ON WITH THE LID GIVE IT A BLITZ THEN WE'LL PASS IT 
IT OFF THROUGH A SIEVE INTO A SMALL BOWL O. K. 
SO PUT THAT ON THERE RIGHT GIVE IT A PULSE ACTUALLY JUST TURN IT ON 
PASS IT OFF THROUGH A SIEVE INTO THAT BOWL BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT 
BITS TO CATCH YOUR TEETH THAT'S WHY WE PASS IT OFF 
NOW THERE'S A SPOON SO PUT THAT THERE PUT THAT THROUGH THERE AND 
PUSH IT REALLY PUSH IT THROUGH 
SO HOW DID THIS VEGETARIAN THING START OFF ORIGINALLY 
I'VE BEEN VEGGIE LIKE SINCE I WAS REALLY YOUNG 
LIKE FIVE OR SIX JUST BECAUSE I WAS NEVER REALLY INTO MEAT AND THEN 
MY MUM AND DAD ARE BOTH REAL FOODIES AND THEY REALLY WANTED ME TO EAT MEAT IT WASN'T SOMETHING 
THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO EAT A LOT DID YOU EAT OUT QUITE A LOT WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER 
NO WE USED TO I MEAN THEY'RE BOTH BRILLIANT COOKS ACTUALLY 
SHE'LL LIKE ME SAYING THAT SHE'S IN THE AUDIENCE BUT DAD IS AS WELL 
DAD MAKES AN AMAZING CURRY SO I'M TOLD I'VE NEVER HAD ONE 
LET ME USE THAT LADLE AND JUST RUB IT ROUND IT MAKES IT SO MUCH EASIER 
I'M A BIT OF A BLACK SHEEP IN THE FAMILY BECAUSE I DON'T EAT CURRY 
AND THAT'S ALL MY FAMILY EAT WELL IT'S NOT BUT DAD LIKES ABOUT THREE CURRIES A WEEK 
AND YOU DIDN'T LIKE MEAT SHOULD I GET RID OF THAT BIT 
I THINK SO CHEF YOU DON'T WANT THE NO NO THAT CAN GO IN THE BIN 
I DON'T BIN ANYTHING AINSLEY JUST QUICKLY OVER HERE 
O. K. HOLD ON THE CHEF'S TALKING 
I'VE ADDED THE EGG YOLK TO THIS AND THAT'S WHY IT'S GOT THE COLOUR JUST 
FOR A DIFFERENT TEXTURE AS WELL AND THIS WILL CATCH ON THE TOP AND I WANT IT TO CATCH ON THE TOP 
A FEW BREADCRUMBS THEN BANG THAT IN THE OVEN FOR TEN MINUTES 
SO I'LL PUT THAT IN TO FINISH AND WE'LL PULL IT OUT AT THE END 
O. K. CHEF THANK YOU RIGHT LOOKING GOOD 
IN THE MEANTIME WHILE THAT'S OPEN I'M JUMPING ALL OVER THE SHOP HERE 
I'VE GOT SOME WEDGES BECAUSE WE'VE GOT POSH FISH AND CHIPS LEAVE ALL THE SKIN ON 
O. K. NINE MINUTES GONE ALREADY GUYS 
THEY GO STRAIGHT BACK INTO THE OVEN DOWN THE BOTTOM TO FINISH OFF 
SAUTE POTATOES COMING NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME TO DO THAT FISH 
LET'S SEE THE RED SNAPPER M. M. M. 
O. K. YOU BECAME A PISCATARIAN AND ALL DOWN TO THE CHEFS ON READY STEADY COOK 
YEAH I HADN'T EATEN IT FOR TWENTY YEARS AND IT'S LIKE A SWEAR WORD IN YOUR BOOK VEGETARIAN 
NO I DON'T THINK SO I THINK IT USED TO BE THE OLD DAYS WHEN ANTONY WORRALL THOMPSON 
PEOPLE CAME INTO THE RESTAURANT SLOW THE WHOLE PROCESS DOWN BUT NOW THEY CATER FOR VEGETARIANS 
YES YOU GET MUCH MORE CHOICE THESE DAYS 
I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE VEGETARIAN AND THE FOOD IS REALLY SUBLIME IT'S WONDERFUL 
I THOUGHT MY DIET WAS A BIT LIMITED THAT I NEEDED A BIT MORE PROTEIN IN MY DIET 
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IT WAS LIMITED GOING TO RESTAURANTS AND STUFF SO I WENT FOR FISH 
TALKING OF FISH LONG FLEXIBLE KNIFE VERY SHARP I DON'T LIKE LOOKING AT HIS FACE 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THAT SHARP FLEXIBLE KNIFE 
USE THE END OF THE KNIFE IT POPS AGAINST THE BONE IF I TURN THIS ROUND 
THERE'S THE BONES IT'S A BIT OF A WEIRD ANGLE 
SO YOU CAN HOPEFULLY SEE IT ALL IN THE CAMERAS 
WORK YOURSELF ALONG THE BONE OF THE FISH AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANY WASTAGE HALF WAY GUYS 
KEEP GOING OVER THE RIB CAGE THIS IS THE HARD PART 
BUT THAT'S HOW YOU GET COMPLETELY BONELESS FILLETS YEAH 
IN THE MEANTIME GET A BIG BOWL GET SOME BAKING POWDER 
SOME SELF RAISING FLOUR AND SOME ICE AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A QUICK BATTER MIX AS WELL 
WOW BAKING POWDER SELF RAISING FLOUR AND ICE THERE WE ARE 
THIS IS WHY YOU'RE HERE YOU'LL NEED A LITTLE BIT OF WATER 
WE'LL CHAT AGAIN NATALIE THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED FOR THAT 
LET'S LEAVE CHEF WE'VE CERTAINLY FOUND OUT A FEW THINGS A CHEAT'S CAULIFLOWER CHEESE 
THAT WAS INTERESTING CHECK OUT THE WEBSITE IF YOU WANT THE RECIPE 
BACK TO ALEX WHO LOVES USING HIS COLOUR JUST LOOK AT THAT 
O. K. CHEF TELL US WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE O. K. 
I'VE GOT SOME VENISON THAT I PAN FRIED 
SO I'VE GOT A CRUST AROUND THE OUTSIDE AND THEN I'M FINISHING OFF COOKING 
RATHER THAN DIRECTLY IN THE PAN ON TOP OF THE ONIONS SO SOME JUICE COMES OUT 
HAVE THAT NICE AND PINK THEN I'LL CARAMELISE THE ONIONS 
LOOKS BEAUTIFUL O. K. OVER HERE THAT WAS A RATHER PUNGENT STOCK WASN'T IT 
THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF IT 
I WON'T NEED QUITE THAT MUCH BUT OVER HERE I'M BOILING UP THAT STOCK 
AND INTO THAT I'M GOING TO ADD SOME REDUCED RED WINE I'M GOING 
TO SEASON THAT UP ADD A BIT OF ORANGE JUICE TOUCH OF ZEST FINISH OFF WITH THE CHOCOLATE 
THAT'S GOING WITH THE VENISON ABSOLUTELY 
AGGIE YOU WANTED TO FIND OUT ABOUT HOW TO 
POACH AN EGG THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS SHE CAME ON READY STEADY COOK TODAY 
I WANT AN EGG THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE IT DOES IN POSH RESTAURANTS 
EXACTLY THAT'S RIGHT AND I'VE NEVER MANAGED IT 
WHAT DO YOU DO THEN HOW DO YOU NORMALLY POACH YOUR EGGS 
WELL ACTUALLY I JUST DO THEM IN PLAIN WATER I DON'T LIKE A POACHER WHERE THEY COME OUT PERFECTLY ROUND 
SO I JUST PUT THEM IN THE WATER TRY NOT TO LET IT 
BOIL TOO MUCH AND IT COMES OUT LOOKING LIKE A FRIED EGG EXCEPT IT'S POACHED 
THE ALBUMEN WHICH IS THE EGG WHITE GOES A LITTLE BIT THAT'S RIGHT ACTUALLY 
BUT I LIKE IT WHEN IT'S ALL SWIRLY AND LOVELY WHAT'S THE SECRET 
THE MOST IMPORTANT SECRET THAT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IS A REALLY FRESH EGG 
AND THE OTHER THING IS YOU WANT TO HAVE THE PERFECT ROUND IN A RESTAURANT THEY PUT IT INTO A PAN 
WITH A LOT OF VINEGAR AND THEN ONCE IT'S NEARLY COOKED 
TAKE IT OUT ICE WATER TRIM IT OFF WITH A PAIR OF SCISSORS OH MY LORD 
AND THEN WARM IT BACK THROUGH AGAIN IT'S TRUE 
WELL BUT WE'LL TRY AND 
WHAT CAN I DO NEXT I'LL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THIS 
HOW MUCH TIME HAVE WE GOT 
ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF MINUTES CHEFS OH LOTS OF TIME 
SO WHAT WE'LL DO WHAT CAN I DO NOW 
THE OTHER TRICK THAT PEOPLE SAY IS I NEED A LITTLE BOWL OF SOME SORT 
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BOWL 
HERE WE GO THIS'LL DO 
WHERE SHALL I FACE TOWARDS AINSLEY 
THE EGG'S NOT THAT FRESH COS YOU'VE GOT LOOSE STUFF AROUND THE OUTSIDE 
BUT YOU'VE GOT THAT TIGHT BIT IN THE MIDDLE SO YOU NEED TO GET RID OF THE OUTSIDE 
WATER THAT'S ALMOST BOILING WHICH THIS ISN'T BUT YOU GET THE IDEA 
FLIP IT OVER ON ITSELF AND GIVE IT A SWIRL 
YOU SEE THERE YOU CAN SEE VERY CLEARLY ALL THE WHITE'S GOING 
ALL THE WHITE'S JUST GOING INTO LITTLE BITS LIKE THAT 
AND THAT MIGHT NOT BE TOO BAD BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE END 
SO AGGIE YOU'VE DONE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN JOURNALISM 
WORKED FOR M. I SIX YOU'VE DONE ALL THESE THINGS 
I KNOW BUT HOW ON EARTH DID YOU EVER SORT OF GET TO DO SOMETHING LIKE HOW CLEAN IS YOUR HOUSE 
IT HAPPENED BY ACCIDENT REALLY I JUST KIND OF FELL INTO THINGS 
RIGHT PLACE OR THE WRONG PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME OR THE WRONG TIME OR WHATEVER 
I NEVER HAD ANY AMBITIONS THINGS JUST HAPPENED 
AND YOU'VE GONE WITH THE FLOW ABSOLUTELY 
HAVE YOU BROUGHT UP YOUR CHILDREN LIKE THAT 
HAVE YOUR BOYS GOT THAT VERY RELAXED APPROACH LIKE THEIR MUM 
YEAH BIT TOO RELAXED FOR MY LIKING 
OH REALLY TYPICAL TEENAGERS EH 
EXACTLY OH THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IT IS I ONLY BLAME MYSELF MIND YOU 
WHAT'S COMING UP NEXT YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE KIND OF 
LOTS OF THINGS IN THE PIPELINE BUT NOTHING ACTUALLY SIGNED OFF YET SO WATCH THIS SPACE 
NOTHING'S GOING TO BE REVEALED 
ON READY STEADY COOK JUST YET BUT I TELL YOU WHAT HAS BEEN REVEALED IS HOW TO PRESENT FOOD 
LOOK HOW MARVELLOUSLY HE'S DONE IT HERE 
I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE ABOUT ALEX AND THE USE OF COLOUR 
ALEX IS GOOD AT IT IT REALLY IS COMING ALIVE HERE 
O. K. IF YOU POP THAT 
ROASTED TOMATO CAN WE GO BACK TO OUR EGG 
BECAUSE I'VE ACTUALLY JUST BY ACCIDENT I'VE DONE IT QUITE NICELY ANYWAY 
THAT'S COME OUT O. K. THAT'S JUST SET AROUND THE OUTSIDE AND ALL YOU DO YOU TAKE THAT 
POP IT IN SOME ICE AND TRIM THE OUTSIDES 
SO POP THAT TO ONE SIDE AND WE'LL DO A LOVELY DISH WITH THAT 
O. K. CHEF NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU PRESENT IT 
WHAT'S THE SECRET DO YOU USE THE ANGLES OF THE PLATE OR WHAT 
WHAT'S THE SECRET IS LOTS OF HERBS BASICALLY 
AND I LIKE TAKING FOOD AND MAKING IT TASTE MORE OF ITSELF 
I'VE TAKEN THE COUSCOUS I'VE INTENSIFIED IT WITH THE BASIL 
COOKED THE TOMATOES SO THEY CONCENTRATE IN FLAVOUR IN THE OVEN 
I'M REDUCING THE RED WINE CARAMELISING THE ONIONS 
LOVELY THIS IS ALMOST A CROSS BETWEEN CARAMELISED AND BURNT I'M NOT 
DINNER PARTIES FOLKS IF YOU BURN SOMETHING A BIT IT'S NICELY CARAMELISED THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE 
O. K. ABOUT THREE MINUTES TO GO NOW GUYS LET'S LEAVE ALEX AND AGGIE DOWN HERE WHO ARE DOING A FANTASTIC 
JOB AS I GET LOTS OF LOVELY COLOUR WE LEFT THE CHEF HERE WITH THE FISH BUT ALREADY HE'S COOKED IT 
TELL US WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH IT 
RIGHT SO FLOUR WATER TOUCH OF BAKING POWDER AS WELL 
AND BASICALLY MIX IT UP SO IT'S A VERY LUMPY BATTER 
USE A PAIR OF TONGS EXCEPTIONALLY HOT OIL 
IT GOES INTO THAT THAT PAN'S HOT EXCUSE ME 
SHALL I LOSE THIS FOR YOU THANK YOU 
O. K. EXCEPTIONALLY HOT OIL GOES INTO THAT AND BUBBLES UP 
AS YOU'VE COOKED IT AND YOU GET WONDERFUL LIGHT CRISP BATTER 
MMM IN THE MEANTIME WITH THE REST OF OUR FISH

SMELL THAT GARLIC THAT'S A BURST OF SUNSHINE 
I KNOW YOU GO STRAIGHT INTO THAT SALAD OH LOVELY

AND THAT WORKS VERY WELL WITH THE VENISON AND THE ORANGE 
I'VE JUST WILTED THE SPROUTS 
TINY TOUCH OF WATER INTO A WOK AND YOU ARE EFFECTIVELY STEAMING THEM 
SO THEY'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF BITE BUT THEY'RE COOKED THROUGH 
IT'S AMAZING THE ONIONS WORK REALLY WELL WITH THE CHOCOLATE BECAUSE THEY'RE SORT OF CARAMELISED

COMING UP FROM CAT POTTER AND SHE'S FROM CARSHALTON 
CAT WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK OUR CHEFS 
MY MUM ALWAYS MAKES LUMPY MASHED POTATO 
CAN YOU GIVE HER SOME WAY TO MAKE IT NOT LUMPY COS IT'S NOT VERY NICE 
THAT'S A REALLY NICE THING TO SAY TO YOUR MUM 
MUM YOUR MASHED POTATOES ARE 
CAN I GO FIRST YES COURSE YOU CAN 
IS MUM THERE MUM GET YOUR DAUGHTER YOUR CHEEKY LITTLE DAUGHTER 
TO PUT IT THROUGH A VERY FINE SIEVE 
BUT FIRST OF ALL YOU NEED TO COOK THE POTATOES COMPLETELY THAT'S VITAL 
COOK THEM COMPLETELY CHOOSE A POTATO THAT'S OLD NOT A NEW POTATO COS THAT'S LESS GLUEY 
AND THEN COOK THEM COMPLETELY STRAIN THEM OFF JUST LEAVE THEM TO DRY 
FOR ONLY A MINUTE NO LONGER SO THAT THE STARCH DOESN'T SET OVER THE TOP 
DON'T DO THEM IN A MACHINE DO IT THROUGH A SIEVE OR JUST WITH A POTATO MASHER LIKE THAT 
IF YOUR ARM GETS TIRED THAT'S WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FOR JAMES WHAT ABOUT YOU 
JAMES TANNER ALEX HAS HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD REALLY 
I USE KING EDWARDS POTATOES BECAUSE THEY'RE QUITE LIGHT AND FLUFFY 
THEY'RE NOT AS STARCHY THEY WON'T GO WALLPAPER PASTY 
GO TO A KITCHEN COOKSHOP AND GET YOURSELF SOMETHING CALLED A POTATO RICER 
AND ALWAYS DO IT WHEN YOUR POTATOES ARE HOT BECAUSE IT'S NICE AND LIGHT 
AND FLUFFY AND YOU PUSH IT THROUGH AND THERE'LL BE NO LUMPS 
AND IF YOU WANT REALLY RESTAURANTY STYLE MASH REDUCE DOWN SOME CREAM 
ADD A TOUCH OF BUTTER NOT A LOT BUT ADD IT WHILE THE POTATOES ARE STILL WARM 
OR THE POTATO WILL GO GLOOPY AGAIN AND REALLY BEAT IT THROUGH 
AND YOU'LL END UP WITH LOVELY RICH SMOOTH MELT IN YOUR MOUTH MASH 
CREAMY SMOOTH POTATO HOW ABOUT THAT CAT DO YOU THINK MUM'S GOT A GOOD BIT OF ADVICE THERE YES 
I DO REMEMBER DELIA YEARS AGO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN TALKING ABOUT MAKING POTATOES 
SHE HAD A MARIS PIPER OR A KING EDWARD BUT WHAT SHE DID SAY 
IS ONCE YOU'VE MASHED THEM A LITTLE BIT 
PUT AN ELECTRIC BEATERS IN THERE BREAK IT DOWN FIRST AND A LITTLE BIT OF MILK LITTLE BIT OF BUTTER 
AND NUTMEG SALT AND PEPPER IF YOU WANT AND GET THE ELECTRIC BEATERS IN THERE 
BECAUSE RICERS ARE A FEW BOB
