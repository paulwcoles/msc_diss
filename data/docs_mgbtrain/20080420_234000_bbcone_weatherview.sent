SISTERS ARE DOING IT FOR THEMSELVES 
STEP KEEP ON 
STEP GOTTA KEEP ON 
STEP KEEP ON 
STEP 
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID 
YOU'RE BUSY LIVING SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE 
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT TO DO 
HELLO AT LAST SOME OF SAW SOME SUNSHINE LATE IN THE DAY ON SUNDAY 
AND MANY MORE WILL SEE SOME SUNSHINE ON MONDAY 
BUT THE SUNSHINE IN THE SOUTH TODAY SUNDAY TRIGGERED NASTY SHOWERS 
THIS CLOUD IS COMING UP FROM FRANCE AND THAT WILL GIVE US MORE RAIN 
IN THE SOUTHERN AREAS AS WELL 
BEFORE THE SUNSHINE WE'LL HAVE HEAVY RAIN TO CONTEND WITH 
THE SHOWERS HAVE PESTERED THE SOUTH ALL EVENING 
AND OVERNIGHT THEY'LL BE JOINED BY RAIN ACROSS SOUTHERN ENGLAND 
SOUTH MIDLANDS SOUTH WALES AS WELL 
NOT A COLD NIGHT HERE BUT ELSEWHERE DESPITE THE CLOUDS 
SOME BREAKS IN NORTH WEST SCOTLAND COULD ALLOW A TOUCH OF FROST 
A MISERABLE RUSH HOUR WITH THE LOW CLOUD AND THE HILL FOG 
IN THE SOUTH AND EVEN FOR NORTHERN IRELAND A LOT MORE CLO L. D. 
THAN OVER THE WEEKEND MISTY AND GREY WITH SOME HILL FOG 
IN SCOTLAND WE HAVE KEPT THE CLEAR SKIES BUT A TOUCH OF FROST BRIEFLY 
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING 
I SUPPOSE THE MAIN CONCERN FOR THE DRIVE TO WORK IS THE LOW CLOUD 
THE PENNINES SOME FOG IN THE AFTERNOON ON THE M. SIXTY TWO 
THAT COULD BE REPEATED AND ADD THAT RAIN IN SOUTHERN AREAS 
AND IT WILL BE EVEN MORE MISERABLE FOR COMMUTERS 
NOT A GREAT START TO THE MORNING 
EVEN WHERE THERE'S NO RAIN A LOT OF CLOUD AND MISTY WEATHER 
BUT IT'S APRIL AFTER ALL THE SUNSHINE'S GETTING STRONGER 
WE'LL SEE THE RAIN GRADUALLY EASING SOUTHWARDS 
AND WE'LL SEE THE LOW CLOUD LIFTING AND THE SUNSHINE COMING THROUGH 
MUCH MORE PROMISING IN THE AFTERNOON 
TEMPERATURES HIGHER IN THE NORTH THAN ON SUNDAY FOURTEEN IN MANCHESTER 
RIGHT ON THE NORTH SEA COAST IT WILL STILL FEEL QUITE CHILLY 
BUT WE LOSE THAT EAST WIND DURING MONDAY NIGHT 
GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE FOR SCOTLAND 
AND IT WILL BRIGHTEN UP IN NORTHERN IRELAND AS WELL WALES TOO 
FURTHER SOUTH WE MAY HOLD ONTO THAT CLOUD AND OUTBREAKS OF RAIN 
WELL INTO THE AFTERNOON LONGEST TO CLEAR FROM DEVON AND CORNWALL 
TEMPERATURES WILL STILL REACH THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN DEGREES EVEN WITH THE RAIN 
A VERY PLEASANT THIRTEEN POTENTIALLY IN LONDON WITH SUNSHINE 
JUST PICKING UP THE BREEZE A BIT MORE IN THE SOUTH 
THEN IT EASES INTO TUESDAY MAYBE A TOUCH OF FROST IN THE GLENS 
FOR MOST OF US A FAIRLY CLOUDY NIGHT AND QUITE MILD 
BUT TUESDAY LOOKS LOVELY FOR MANY OF US 
A CHANCE OF A SHOWER BUT MOSTLY IT'S DRY WITH SOME SUNSHINE 
TEMPERATURES COULD GET HIGHER THAN FOURTEEN IN THE SOUTH AND THE EAST 
BUT IT WON'T LAST BECAUSE WE'LL HAVE RAIN SWEEPING ACROSS THE U. K. 
ON WEDNESDAY A SLOW BAND OF WET WEATHER WITH SIGNIFICANT RAIN 
IT CLEARS AWAY TO GIVE SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS FOR THURSDAY 
TEMPERATURES STARTING TO RISE BY THEN AND JUST A HINT 
THAT BY THE WEEKEND WE MIGHT HAVE TWENTY DEGREES IN SOUTHERN AREAS 
AS EVER PLENTY MORE WEATHER ON OUR WEBSITE
