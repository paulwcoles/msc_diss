WE'RE DELIGHTED THEY'RE BACK WITH ONE NOW LET'S WELCOME PORTISHEAD 
I SAW A SAVIOUR 
A SAVIOUR COME MY WAY 
I THOUGHT I'D SEE IT 
IN THE COLD LIGHT OF DAY 
BUT NOW I REALISE 
THAT I'M ONLY FROM ME 
IF ONLY I COULD SEE 
RETURN MYSELF TO ME 
AND RECOGNISE THE POISON IN MY HEART 
THERE IS NO OTHER PLACE 
NO ONE ELSE I FACE 
NO REMEDY 
TO AGREE WITH HOW I FEEL 
HERE AM I WITH PLENTY 
WHAT MORE CAN I SAY 
FOR I AM GUILTY 
FOR THE VOICE THAT I OBEY 
TOO SCARED TO SACRIFICE 
A CHOICE CHOSEN FOR ME 
IF ONLY I COULD SEE 
RETURN MYSELF TO ME 
AND RECOGNISE THE POISON IN MY HEART 
THERE IS NO OTHER PLACE 
NO ONE ELSE I FACE 
NO REMEDY 
THAT WILL AGREE WITH HOW I FEEL 
PORTISHEAD MACHINE GUN FROM THE ALBUM THIRD 
NOW OUR NEXT GUEST I'M GOING TO BE CHATTING WITH IS REALLY A LEGEND 
BECAUSE HIS RECORD LABEL CHESS 
IS ONE OF THE GREAT RECORD LABELS OF ALL TIME AND I'M DELIGHTED TO WELCOME MARSHALL CHESS 
IT'S A GREAT HONOUR TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW 
YOU'VE GOT THIS GREAT NEW RECORD OUT 
WHICH IS A LOT OF THE GREAT BLUES PEOPLE YOU HAD ON CHESS WITH NEW ACCOMPANIMENT 
WE'LL COME ONTO THAT IN A MOMENT BUT I'D LIKE TO START OFF HOW DID CHESS RECORDS START UP 
MY FATHER AND UNCLE STARTED IT THEY HAD A NIGHTCLUB WHERE A LOT OF BLACK MUSICIANS HUNG OUT IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN 
CHESS STARTED IN NINETEEN FIFTY 
ONE BY ONE WE HAD ALL THE BLUES GREATS IN THE WORLD 
MUDDY WATERS HOWLIN' WOLF SONNY BOY WILLIAMSON JOHN LEE HOOKER ETTA JAMES CHUCK BERRY BO DIDLEY 
I KNOW THERE'S NEVER BEEN A LABEL LIKE IT 
QUITE INCREDIBLE SOME OF THE GREATEST BLUES ARTISTS 
THE GREATEST BLUES POETS THAT EVER EXISTED WERE ALL ON THAT LABEL 
IT BECAME THE FOUNDATION OF ROCK'N'ROLL YOU GUYS IN THE U. K. IS WHAT REALLY SPREAD IT 
ALL THE GREAT BRITISH GROUPS THAT WERE INFLUENCED BY CHESS 
AND ALL THE BLUES MUSIC THEY LISTENED TO OF COURSE 
WHAT MADE IT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER LABELS THAT WERE AROUND 
WE HAD GREAT STUDIOS MAKING THE BEST MUSIC WAS THE KEY TO MAKING MONEY 
ARTISTS CAME TO US THEY WANTED A BETTER LIFE 
BUT MY UNCLE AND MY FATHER REALISED VERY EARLY 
THAT MAKING THE BEST RECORDS MADE MOST MONEY EVERYONE WAS HAPPIER 
THIS RECORD THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT TRACKS 
MEMPHIS SLIM MOTHER EARTH TOM JONES LOVES THAT SONG 
GREAT SONGS BUT IT'S VERY INTERESTING THEY'VE BEEN REWORKED OR RETROFITTED 
RETROFITTED RETROFITTED WITH RHYTHM IS THE WAY YOU PUT IT 
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AT A LABEL THAT STARTED HIP HOP SUGAR HILL RECORDS IN AMERICA 
WITH GRANDMASTER FLASH WHITE LINES THE MESSAGE CAME OUT OF 
AND I MET KEITH LEBLANC THE DRUMMER 
WHO BECAME TACKHEAD HERE IN THE U. K. 
DOUG WIMBISH WAS THE BASS PLAYER 
HE PLAYED WITH THE STONES LIVING COLOUR 
AND SKIP MCDONALD IS LITTLE AXE NOW 
AND THEY WERE THE ORIGINAL RHYTHM SECTION 
I BECAME FRIENDS WITH THEM 
AND WE DECIDED TO TRY THIS PROJECT WHERE WE TOOK THE VOCALS 
OFF THE OLD BLUES RECORDS 
AND ADDED THOSE THREE GUYS 
WITH A MODERN HIP HOP SORT OF RHYTHM SECTION TO THE OLD VOICES 
SOME OF THE PURISTS MIGHT SAY HANG ON A MINUTE 
YOU'RE MESSING WITH THE MONA LISA HERE YOU'RE REPAINTING THE YEAH 
THE HAYWAIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH 
TO GROW UP IN THE COMPANY AND ONE OF MY JOBS WAS SPREAD THE BLUES 
WE KNEW THAT WE HAD THIS MAGIC 
BUT WE WANTED TO TURN ON EVERY GENERATION TO IT 
SO I DID IT I DID IT WITH ELECTRIC MUD A PSYCHEDELIC BLUES ALBUM 
FOLK BLUES ALBUMS EVERYTHING I COULD 
AND THIS IS ANOTHER SHOT AT IT 
SPREADING IT TO A NEW AUDIENCE WHAT IS THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE BLUES FOR YOU 
THE BLUES TELLS THE STORY OF LIFE THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US 
IF YOU LISTEN TO THE BLUES YOU GET LESSONS IN LIFE 
BLUES CAME FROM PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO READ OR WRITE 
THAT HAD PROBLEMS THEY MOVED FROM THE SOUTH TO THE NORTH IN AMERICA 
THOSE LYRICS THE BLUES RECORDS HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE 
IT WAS LIKE MUSICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
AND TELL US ABOUT SOME WE'VE GOT A BIT OF FOOTAGE OF MUDDY WATERS 
HE WAS THE GREATEST HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HIM 
IF HE WAS BORN IF HE WAS BORN IN AFRICA HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CHIEF OF THE TRIBE 
OR THE PRESIDENT HE WAS A REGAL GREAT MAN 
AND TO ME HE WAS THE GREATEST BLUES ARTIST THAT EVER LIVED 
HE JUST WAS AMAZING AND THE WAY HE SANG 
WHEN HE WAS YOUNG BEFORE WHITE PEOPLE DISCOVERED HIM 
HE WAS OLDER WHEN HE WAS YOUNG HE WAS A MAJOR MAJOR SEX SYMBOL MAN 
HE MADE WOMEN SCREAM AND CRY WHEN HE GOT ON STAGE 
WELL LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT HIM RIGHT NOW 
GOT MY MOJO WORKING GOT MY MOJO WORKING 
GOT MY MOJO WORKING GOT MY MOJO WORKING 
GOT MY MOJO WORKING GOT MY MOJO WORKING 
GOT MY MOJO WORKING 
BUT IT JUST DON'T WORK ON YOU 
GOT MY MOJO WORKING GOT MY MOJO WORKING 
BRRRRRRRR WHOOP GOT MY MOJO WORKING 
GOT MY MOJO WORKING GOT MY MOJO WORKING 
GOT MY MOJO WORKING GOT MY MOJO WORKING 
GOT MY MOJO WORKING BUT IT 
JUST DON'T WORK ON YOU 
THAT'S REALLY FANTASTIC 
NOW I SUPPOSE MY LAST QUESTION 
THIS RECORD'S GREAT BUT ALSO I HEARD 
IS THERE A FILM IN PRODUCTION ABOUT CHESS TWO FILMS 
CADILLAC RECORDS IS THAT CADILLAC IS ONE THE OTHER IS CALLED CHESS 
OR MAYBE WHO DO YOU LOVE BOTH DIFFERENT STORIES 
BOTH ABOUT THOUGH MY FATHER'S RELATIONSHIP WITH MUDDY WATERS 
VERY UNUSUAL AT THAT ERA FOR A WHITE AND BLACK MAN TO BE FRIENDS 
AND GO TO EACH OTHER'S HOUSES AND WORK TOGETHER 
AND IS IT TRUE BEYONCE IS GOING TO BE PLAYING ETTA JAMES 
DO YOU KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO BE BEYONCE YES I SAW HER 
I'VE HEARD THE TRACKS SHE CUT 
AND I SAW HER DO HER MAJOR FRENCH KISS SCENE WITH ADRIEN BRODY 
WHO'S PLAYING MY FATHER IT BLEW ME AWAY 
OH WOW SEEING BEYONCE KISSING YOUR DAD OH IT'S TOO MUCH 
AND I ASKED ETTA JAMES I SAID 
DID YOU EVER HAVE ANYTHING WITH MY DAD 
SHE SAID NO WAY HE KISSED ME ON THE CHEEK ONCE 
I ASKED ADRIEN BRODY HE SAID IT WAS AMAZING 
COS HE HAD TO KISS HER DEEPLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY TIMES 
HE WAS LOVING IT THAT'S THE MOVIES FOR YOU 
WELL IT'S FANTASTIC THIS RECORD IS OUT CHESS MOVES IS OUT NOW

ELYNE ROAD 
NOW ALEX TURNER FROM THE ARCTIC MONKEYS 
AND MILES KANE FROM THE RASCALS HAVE JOINED TOGETHER 
AND HAVE CREATED THE LAST SHADOW PUPPETS 
ABOUT AS SUBTLE AS AN EARTHQUAKE I KNOW 
MY MISTAKES WERE MADE FOR YOU 
IN THE BACK ROOM OF A BAD DREAM 
SHE CAME AND WHISKED ME AWAY ENTHUSED 
AND IT'S AS SOLID AS A ROCK ROLLING DOWN A HILL 
THE FACT IS THAT IT PROBABLY WILL 
HIT SOMETHING ON A HAZARDOUS TERRAIN 
WE'RE JUST FOLLOWING THE FLOCK 
ROUND AND IN BETWEEN 
BEFORE WE'RE SMASHED TO SMITHEREENS 
LIKE THEY WERE AND WE SCRAMBLE FROM THE BLAME 
AND IT'S THE FAME THAT PUT WORDS IN HER MOUTH 
SHE COULDN'T HELP BUT SPIT 'EM OUT 
INNOCENCE AND ARROGANCE ENTWINED 
IN THE FILTHIEST OF MINDS 
WELL SHE WAS BITTEN ON HER BIRTHDAY AND NOW 
FACING THE CROWD SHE'S LOST 
BUT I SUSPECT THAT NOW FOREVER THE SHAPE 
SHE CAME TO ESCAPE IS FORGOT 
AND IT'S A LOT TO ASK HER NOT TO STING 
GIVE HER LESS THAN EVERYTHING 
AROUND YOUR CROOKED CONSCIENCE SHE WILL WIND 
AND WE'RE JUST FOLLOWING THE FLOCK ROUND AND IN BETWEEN 
BEFORE WE'RE SMASHED TO SMITHEREENS 
LIKE THEY WERE AND WE SCRAMBLE FROM THE BLAME 
AND IT'S THE FAME THAT PUT WORDS IN HER MOUTH 
SHE COULDN'T HELP BUT SPIT 'EM OUT 
AROUND YOUR CROOKED CONSCIENCE SHE WILL WIND 
AND IT'S A LOT TO ASK HER NOT TO STING 
GIVE HER LESS THAN EVERYTHING 
INNOCENCE AND ARROGANCE ENTWINED 
AS SHE WALKS IN THE ROOM 
SCENTED AND TALL 
HESITATING ONCE MORE 
AND AS I TAKE ON MYSELF 
AND THE BITTERNESS I FELT 
I REALISE THAT LOVE LOST 
WILD WHITE HORSES 
THEY WILL TAKE ME AWAY 
AND THE TENDERNESS I FEEL 
WILL SEND THE DARK UNDERNEATH 
WILL I FOLLOW 
THROUGH THE GLORY OF LIFE 
I WAS SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR 
DISAPPOINTED AND SORE 
AND IN MY THOUGHTS I HAVE BLED 
FOR THE RIDDLES I'VE BEEN FED 
ANOTHER LIE MOVES OVER 
WILD WHITE HORSES 
THEY WILL TAKE ME AWAY 
AND THE TENDERNESS I FEEL 
WILL SEND THE DARK UNDERNEATH 
WILL I FOLLOW 
WILD WHITE HORSES 
THEY WILL TAKE ME AWAY 
AND THE TENDERNESS I FEEL 
WILL SEND THE DARK UNDERNEATH 
WILL I FOLLOW
