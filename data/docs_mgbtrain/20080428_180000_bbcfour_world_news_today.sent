IN AUSTRIA SAY IT 
HAS 
MAN TO KEEPING HIS 
DAUGHTER CAPTIVE THE TWENTY FOUR YEARS AND 
REPEATEDLY RAPING HER HE TOLD 
POLICE HE HAD FATHERED SEVEN 
CHILDREN WITH HER 
THE FACT WHICH 
WE HAVE BEFORE US ARE SHOCKING AND 
TERRIFYING BECAUSE WE ARE DEALING 
WITH THE CRIME HERE WHICH HAS GONE 
ON FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS 
THE B. B. C. UNCOVERS 
EVIDENCE THAT SOME UN PEACEKEEPERS 
ARE GIVING ALMS TO NOTORIOUS 
MILITIAS IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 
OF CONGO IN EXCHANGE FOR GOLD 
THE WAR HAS ENDED FOR CHECHNYA HAS 
PROBLEMS ARE FAR FROM OVER AS THE 
PROVINCE STRUGGLES TO RECOVER FROM 
YEARS OF FIGHTING VIOLENCE ACROSS 
THE BORDER AT TO FEARS FOR THE 
REGION'S STABILITY 
AND THE ZIMBABWE AND ROCK BAND WITH 
A MESSAGE MAN FRIDAY PREPARES ITS 
ASSAULT ON THE CHARTS WITHOUT THE 
HELP OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY 
HELLO AND WELCOME THERE IS A SHOCK 
AND DISBELIEF IN AUSTRIA WHICH IS 
REVERBERATING AROUND THE WORLD AT 
THE HORRIFIC SEX ABUSE CASE IN THE 
QUIET TOWN OF AMSTETTEN IN AUSTRIA 
IT IS ALLEGED THAT A MAN LOCKED UP 
HIS DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS EIGHTEEN IN A 
CELLAR THERE SHE REMAINED CAPTIVE 
FOR A QUARTER OF A SENTRY DURING 
THIS TIME HE FATHERED SEVEN 
CHILDREN FROM HER THE TRAGEDY CAME 
TO LIGHT WHEN ONE OF THOSE CHILDREN 
NEEDED URGENT HOSPITAL TREATMENT 
IT IS REMINISCENT OF THE CAPTIVITY 
OF NATASCHA KAMPUSCH HELD FOR EIGHTEEN 
YEARS AND QUESTIONS ARE BEING HELD 
AS TO HOW THIS CASE COULD HAVE GONE 
UNDETECTED FOR SO LONG 
THE FIRST IMAGES FROM INSIDE 
AUSTRIA'S HOUSE OF HORROR THE TWENTY FOUR 
YEARS ELIZABETH FOR IT WILL 
ELISABETH FRITZL WAS IMPRISONED IN 
THIS BASEMENT AND SEXUALLY ABUSED 
BY HER OWN GRANDFATHER JOSEF F. SEVENTY THREE 
IS NOW UNDER ARREST HE ADMITTED 
THAT HE NOT ONLY KEPT HIS DAUGHTER 
ON GO UNDERGROUND HE FATHERED 
HER SEVEN CHILDREN 
HIS DAUGHTER 
AT THE TIME EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WAS 
SELECTED BY HIM AND LOCKED IN HIS 
CELLAR HE ADMITTED TO THAT AND 
ALSO ADMITTED THAT HE BEAT HER HE 
INCARCERATED HER AGAINST HER WORLD 
AND HE ADMITTED THAT HE HAS 
COMMITTED SEXUAL ACTS ON HIS 
DAUGHTER A NUMBER OF TIMES 
FORENSIC TEAMS HAVE BEEN VISITING 
THE HOUSE THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
INVESTIGATING A NIGHTMARE WHICH 
UNFOLDED IN THE CELLAR POLICE HAVE 
RELEASED A DESCRIPTION OF HIS 
SECRET DUNGEON INSIDE HE KEPT THE 
ENTRANCE TO A NETWORK OF ROOMS 
HIDDEN BEHIND SHELVES ONLY HE KNEW 
THE CODE FOR THE DOOR A NARROW 
PASSAGE LED TO AN AREA FOR SLEEPING 
ANOTHER FOR COOKING AND A THIRD FOR 
WASHING DETECTIVES SAY THE 
CEILINGS ARE LOW AND THOSE INSIDE 
NEVER SAW NATURAL LIGHT IT IS 
THOUGHT HIS WIFE WAS COMPLETELY 
UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON WHAT 
HAS SHOCKED AUSTRIANS ABOUT THIS 
CASE IS NOT ONLY THE HORRIFIC 
DETAIL THAT HAS EMERGED TO TAKE 
PLACE INSIDE HIS HOUSE IT IS ALSO 
THE REALISATION THAT THE TWENTY FOUR YEARS 
NOBODY IN THIS TOWN APPEARED TO 
KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING HERE NOW 
AMSTETTEN IS STRUGGLING TO COME TO 
TERMS WITH THE NEWS 
A I THINK IT 
IS HORRIBLE IT IS JUST THE THOUGHT 
THAT THIS IS HAPPENING DOWN THE 
STREET FROM WHERE I LIVE IT IS 
SHOCKING BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THE 
FAMILY IT HAS BEEN VERY QUIET I 
NEVER SAW ANYONE GOING IN OR OUT A A ONE HOUSE WITH ITS TERRIFYING 
SECRET CAST A SHADOW OVER THE 
WHOLE COUNTRY 
JOINING US NOW FROM AMSTETTEN IS 
THE CHIEF REPORTER AT THE AUSTRIAN 
NEWSPAPER YOU WERE ACTUALLY AT THE 
PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE THE 
AUTHORITIES WERE TELLING US ABOUT 
THE DETAILS SURELY IT MUST 
REPRESENT ON UNIMAGINABLE FAILURE 
ON THEIR PART 
YES AND NO ON THE 
ONE HAND YES BECAUSE THE POLICE 
INVESTIGATE DIDN'T INVESTIGATE 
ENOUGH WHEN THE GIRL WENT MISSING 
TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO ON THE OTHER HAND 
THE FATHER WAS SUCH A PERFECT ACTOR 
HE EVEN HAD LETTERS FROM HIS 
DAUGHTER BECAUSE HE ASKED HER TO 
WRITE THESE LETTERS AND THEY 
SEEMED TO BE PROVED ENOUGH FOR THE 
POLICE 
DON'T YOU THINK WHEN THESE POLICE BABIES STARTED APPEARING ON THEIR 
PARENTS' DOORSTEP THAT ALARMS 
SHOULD HAVE SOUNDED 
THE PROBLEM IS 
I THINK ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO PEOPLE 
DID NOT TAKE SO MUCH CARE OF D. N. A. 
BECAUSE IF THEY HAD PROVED THE IT'S 
THIS BABY WAS THE BABY OF 
ELIZABETH THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND 
THE TRUTH D. N. A. WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY 
GOOD IN THIS CASE 
THERE IS CHILD 
ABUSE ALL OVER THE WORLD BUT WE SEE 
THE NATASCHA KAMPUSCH THIS CASE AND 
NOW THIS ONE SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT 
AN AUSTRIAN SYNDROME 
I DON'T THINK 
SO FIRST OF ALL YOU HEAR THE STORY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA DRACULA WE HEAR 
THIS CASE OF NATASCHA KAMPUSCH IN 
THE CELLAR FOR EIGHT YEARS BUT NOT 
EVEN THE MOTHER AND THE OTHER 
SISTERS AND BROTHERS FELT ANYTHING 
THAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE CELLAR 
HE WAS A PERFECT CRIMINAL BECAUSE 
IT WAS ISOLATED AND IN AUSTRIA WE 
ARE WELL KNOWN FOR SKIING ARNOLD 
SCHWARZENEGGER COMES FROM HERE AND 
SO ON IT IS A LOVELY COUNTRY AND 
PEOPLE THINK WE ARE FRIENDLY IT IS 
NOT TYPICAL OF AUSTRIA IT IS A 
PERSONAL FAILURE 
DON'T YOU THINK 
IN A QUIET TOWN LIKE AMSTETTEN THAT 
PEOPLE PERHAPS OTHER TENDENCY NOT 
TO PRY IN OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES 
PERHAPS THERE IS A TENDENCY IN 
AUSTRIA TO RESPECT PRIVACY 
SOMETIMES MORE THAN NECESSARY I I DON'T THINK IT IS A QUESTION OF 
PRIVACY BECAUSE I WAS TALKING TO 
THE NEIGHBOURS AND THEY HAD BUT 
HE WAS A MONSTER WHO WENT DOWN THE 
CELLAR IN THE EVENING AND BROUGHT 
THOSE FOODS NOT IN THE TOWN BUT 
OUTSIDE HE CAME IN THE EVENING AND 
WAS LEADING A PERFECT DOUBLE LIFE 
NEIGHBOURS WERE TALKING TO EACH 
OTHER AND HIS WIFE WAS SUCH A 
FRIENDLY PERSON EVEN SHE DIDN'T 
REALISE WHAT WAS GOING ON 
WHAT IS 
THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE NOW IN 
AMSTETTEN 
THE ATMOSPHERE IS AMSTETTEN HORRIBLE BECAUSE PEOPLE AS YOU 
ASKED ME ASKING THEMSELVES ARE WE 
GUILTY WE DIDN'T SEE OR FEEL 
ANYTHING WE DIDN'T REALISE WHAT 
WAS GOING ON IN THE CELLAR BUT 
THEY HAD NO CHANCE BECAUSE I WAS 
TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE 
SAME HOUSE THE BAKERY SOMEONE 
TOLD ME THAT THE MONSTER CAME EVERY 
DAY AND HE BOUGHT SOME BREAD AND 
MILK AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE 
WEATHER AND SO ON HE DIDN'T 
REALISE WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE 
CELLAR SO THE PROBLEM FOR AMSTETTEN 
IS PEOPLE SAY WE ARE NORMAL 
ORDINARY PEOPLE WE ARE LOVELY 
PEOPLE NOW THIS HAPPENS TO US 
AS THE DETAILS EMERGED OF THIS 
HORRIFIC CASE I SPOKE TO THE 
BRITISH CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGIST 
KEVIN BROWN I ASKED HIM HOW THIS 
CASE COMPARED TO OTHERS INVOLVING 
INCEST AND SEXUAL ABUSE 
IN THE WAY 
THAT THE VICTIM WAS IMPRISONED FOR 
SO LONG WITHOUT DISCOVERY THAT IS 
UNIQUE IN ITSELF ALTHOUGH THE FEAR 
OF THE OFFENDER OF DISCLOSURE 
AROUND EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN WHEN THE CHILD 
REACHES ADULT COURT AND HE LOSES 
CONTROL THIS IS PROBABLY WHY IT 
WAS THAT DAY COME ON HER NINETEENTH 
BIRTHDAY HE DECIDED TO IMPRISON 
HER HE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSING 
HIS DAUGHTER SINCE ELEVEN AND HE FEARED 
THIS WOULD ESCAPE INTO THE 
COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF KNOWLEDGE AND 
POSSIBLY TO THE POLICE IN TERMS OF 
A CRIMINAL CONVICTION 
BUT WHEN IT 
COMES TO SEXUAL ABUSE AND INCEST 
HOW COMMON IS IT FOR THE ABUSE TO 
BE CARRIED OUT BY BIOLOGICAL 
FATHERS RATHER THAN STEP FATHERS 
DIFFERENT STUDIES VARY AND IT 
RANGES BETWEEN FIVE PER CENT OF IMPRISONED SEX 
OFFENDERS TO TWENTY PER CENT OF IMPRISONED SEX 
OFFENDERS HAVE THINGS INCESTUOUS 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR SONS OR 
DAUGHTERS THESE INCESTUOUS FATHERS 
OR STEPFATHERS HAVE ALSO A HIGH 
PROBABILITY OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING 
OTHER CHILDREN SO AT LEAST HALF OF 
THEM ARE TRUE PAEDOPHILES VICTIMS VICTIMS LIKE ELIZABETH PRESUMABLY THEY ARE 
CONDITIONED INTO COMPLYING WITH HER 
FATHER'S SEXUAL DEMANDS OVER SO 
MANY YEARS IS THAT WHY IT IT WENT 
ON FOR SO LONG 
INCESTUOUS FATHERS 
AND ACQUAINTANCES HAVE CHILDREN CAR 
WORSE CHILDREN INTO SEXUAL ACTIVITY 
AND TRICK THEM THEY PUT FORWARD 
THE IDEA THAT IT IS EDUCATION OR 
THEY PUT FORWARD THE IDEA IT IS AN 
EXPRESSION OF LOVE BETWEEN A 
DAUGHTER AND FATHER AND SO IT IS 
NOT BY FORCE USUALLY THAT HER 
STEPFATHER OR A FATHER WILL 
SEXUALLY ASSAULT THEIR DAUGHTER OR 
SON IT IS BY COERCION AND CAREFUL 
PLANNING AND DESENSITISING THE 
CHILD TO INCREASED TOUCHING THEY 
FORM A RELATIONSHIP WHICH THE CHILD 
ONLY BEGINS TO GRADUALLY REALISE BY 
COMPARISON WITH OTHER CHILDREN IN 
THEIR ENVIRONMENT WHICH THIS 
PARTICULAR CHILD WOULD PROBABLY NOT 
HAVE HAD BY COMPARISON WITH OTHER 
CHILDREN THEY BEGIN TO LEARN 
SOMETHING IS WRONG THEN THERE IS A 
FEAR OF DISCLOSURE A FEAR OF 
BREAKDOWN OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND 
THAT IS WHEN THINGS CAN GET NASTY 
I WANT TO LOOK AT THE VICTIMS AND 
THE ABUSER WHAT GOES ON FROM HERE 
THE FATHER WOULD HE FEEL ANY 
REMORSE ANY REGRET AT WHAT HE HAD 
DONE AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE 
VICTIMS RECOVERING FROM THIS 
ORDEAL 
IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR ORDEAL THE VICTIM TO HEAR FROM THE FATHER 
AND THE FATHER TO ADMIT THAT WHAT 
HE HAS DONE IS COMPLETELY WRONG 
AND THAT HE WAS COMPLETELY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS IT WILL ALSO 
BE IMPORTANT FOR THE VICTIM TO 
BELIEVE THAT HER MOTHER HAD NOTHING 
TO DO WITH IT AND HER MOTHER JUST 
DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON 
BECAUSE TO LOSE ONE POTENTIAL 
PARENT 
IS BAD ENOUGH TO LOSE TWO IS VERY TRAUMATIC A CHILD IN 
SUCH TRAUMATIC AND VULNERABLE 
CIRCUMSTANCES CIRCUMSTANCES AN INVESTIGATION BY THE B. B. C. HAS 
UNCOVERED EVIDENCE THAT UN 
PEACEKEEPING TROOPS ARE ARMING SOME 
OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS MILITIAS IN 
THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF CONGO DECADES OF 
VIOLENCE HAVE LEFT MILLIONS DEAD 
THERE RIVAL MILITIAS COMPETE IN 
THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY AND THE 
CLAIMS THAT UN PEACEKEEPERS HAVE 
PROVIDED MILITIAS WITH WEAPONS AND 
AMMUNITION IN EXCHANGE FOR GOLD 
ADDS AN EXPLOSIVE INGREDIENT TO AN 
ALREADY VOLATILE MIX THE UN 
INSISTS THE CLAIMS CAME TO LIGHT 
SOME TIME AGO AND THAT THERE IS 
NOTHING NEW IN THEM THE B. B. C.'S 
AFRICAN EDITOR BEGAN THE 
INVESTIGATIONS AND HAS BEEN LOOKING 
INTO THE ALLEGATIONS FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
IS THIS STILL GOING ON 
I'M AFRAID 
IT IS THE UN MAY SAY IT IS NOT NEW 
BUT I HAVE A REPORT DATED FROM 
FEBRUARY THIS YEAR THIS RELATES TO 
INDIAN PEACEKEEPERS AROUND THE TOWN 
OF GOMA AND THE ALLEGATIONS ARE 
APPALLING THEY INVOLVE EVERYTHING 
UP TO AND INCLUDING A UNITED 
NATIONS HELICOPTER TO FLY 
AMMUNITION INTO A NATIONAL PARK TO 
DO A DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
INVOLVED IN THE RWANDAN GENOCIDE 
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE A WORSE GROUP TO 
BE DEALING WITH AND OUT COMES 
IVORY THERE ARE FORTY FOUR ALLEGATIONS IN 
HERE SIX OF THEM ARE CORROBORATED 
AND THEY INVOLVE GUNS GOLD AND 
AMMUNITION 
WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE AMMUNITION YOU HAVE UNCOVERED 
WE WENT TO 
ANOTHER TOWN FURTHER NORTH AROUND 
THE TOWN OF MONGBWALU A SMALL 
MINING TOWN OF EL TOWN VERY RICH 
IN GOLD WE WENT AND SPOKE TO THEM 
AND WE FOUND OUT FROM THE LOCALS 
THAT THEY HAD SEEN MILITIA BEING 
REARMED BY THE PAKISTANI TROOPS IN 
THE AREA THEY ARE NOT THE TROOPS 
THERE NOW THEY WERE THERE A COUPLE 
OF YEARS AGO THE WEAPONS WENT FROM 
THIS FROM THE PAKISTAN IS TO THE 
MILITIA PEOPLE SAID THEY SAW SEVEN 
BOXES IF WEAPONS COMING DOWN THE 
HILL WHEN THERE WAS A CRITICAL ARMY 
A CRITICAL FIGHT ON THE OTHER 
SIDE OF THE COUNTRY WE INTERVIEWED 
THE MILITIA LEADERS THEMSELVES AND 
THIS IS WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY YES YES IT'S TRUE THEY DID GIVE US ARMS 
WHY WOULD I LIE THE AREN'T THEY 
GAVE US WERE USED FOR SECURITY 
THEY GAVE ME THE WEAPONS THEN I 
DISTRIBUTED THEM TOUR WAS RECEIVED 
WEAPONS 
WHAT IS THE UN'S RESPONSE WEAPONS THEY HAVE BASICALLY SAID THEY WERE 
EITHER OLD ALLEGATIONS OR 
UNSUBSTANTIATED IT WAS 
UNSUBSTANTIATED IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY WE COULD GO TO THIS 
SMALL TOWN AND IN A WEEK WE COULD 
FIND THE ALLEGATIONS THEY COULD NOT 
THE SYNDICATE THE UN WAS NOT TRYING 
THAT HARD IN A SENSE IT IS A 
PROBLEM FOR THEM IT IS 
EMBARRASSING THEY DON'T HAVE 
TROOPS HAVE THEIR OWN TO THROW 
THESE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THEM IS 
VERY DIFFICULT WE WENT TO SEE THE 
HEAD OF THE UNITED NATIONS 
OPERATION IN THE CONGO MY 
COLLEAGUE WHO HAS BEEN WORKING FOR 
PANORAMA WITH ME ON THIS 
INVESTIGATION HE ASKED HIM WHAT 
HIS REACTION WAS 
I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE MILITIA 
LEADERS THEY SAY THAT THE ARMS 
THEY RECEIVED WHERE THE ARMS THEY 
DEMOBILISED WITH WHAT DO YOU SAY 
TO THAT 
THE MISH YARS HAVE THEIR 
INTERESTS IF YOU WILL 
MILITIAS IF YOU WILL ALL I CAN 
SAY IS THAT THIS INVESTIGATION DID 
NOT CONFIRM THAT 
THAT IS ALAN DOSS SAYING WHAT DO 
YOU EXPECT FROM MILITIA LEADERS WE 
HAVE HAD RESPONSES FROM THE 
PAKISTANI ARMY TODAY THEY HAVE 
SAID THEY HAVE CO OPERATED WITH THE 
UN INQUIRY FOR A FULL YEAR THERE 
IS NO EVIDENCE THIS IS PROPAGANDA 
AND PEACEKEEPERS ALL OVER THE WORLD 
DO A FINE AND DANGEROUS JOB BUT 
THE UN WILL HAVE TO FIND A MORE 
EFFECTIVE WAY OF DEALING WITH THE 
MINORITY 
INDEED THE PROBLEM IS MINORITY THEY HAVE NO TROOPS OF THEIR OWN 
THEY HAVE TO BORROW TROOPS FROM 
OTHER COUNTRIES THE TROOPS THEN 
ANSWER TO THEIR OWN LEADERSHIP IT 
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DISCIPLINE 
THEM ONE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE 
UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN DON'T 
SUPPLY MANY TROOPS TO THE UN 
STPHR THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW LET US TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
OTHER NEWS 
RESCUE WORKERS IN EASTERN CHINA SAY 
UP TO SEVENTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN 
A CRASH INVOLVING TWO PASSENGER 
TRAINS MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED PASSENGERS 
WERE INJURED AT ZIBO IN THE 
SHANGDONG PROVINCE INVESTIGATORS 
BLAMED THE CRASH ON HUMAN EROR 
THE ISRAELI ARMY SAY THAT EXPLOSIVE 
THAT WENT OFF IN THE GAZA STRIP ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLING OF A 
MOTHER AND FOUR CHILDREN 
THE TWO FACTIONS OF THE ZIMBABWE 
OPPOSITION HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY ARE 
TO WORK TOGETHER TO FORM A 
PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY TO FORM A 
GROUP AGAINST ZANU P. F. THE MOVEMENT 
FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE'S LEADER 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI URGED ROBERT 
MUGABE TO ADMIT DEE FEET 
AND THE INSTANT CASH GIVEN BY THE 
TAXMAN IN THE U. S. IS HOPED TO 
RELIEVE THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
ONCE IT DOMINATED THE HEADLINES FOR 
THE TENS OF THOUSAND WHO IS DIED IN 
THE BLOODY BATTLES THAT FOLLOWED 
THE BREAKUP OF THE SOVIET UNION 
NOW CHECHNYA IS NO LONGER THE 
FRONT PAGE NEWS BUT THE PROBLEMS 
ARE FAR FROM OVER IT LACKS BASIC 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WITH THE 
VIOLENCE IN THE NEIGHBOURING 
INGUSHETIA THERE ARE PROBLEMS FOR 
THE WHOLE OF THE REGION 
THIS INHOSPITABLE AND UNFORGIVING 
LANDSCAPE HAS CHALLENGED THE 
KREMLIN SINCE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
TODAY THE RUSSIAN MILITARY STILL 
WATCHES CLOSELY THE WAR IN 
CHECHNYA MAY BE OVER BUT ON MY 
FIRST VISIT TOT NORTH CAUCASUS FOR 
EIGHT YEARS I GOT THE SENSE THAT 
MOSCOW FORCES STILL FEEL THIS 
REGION IS A REAL THREAT 
THERE ARE HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS IN 
THE AIR 
THERE ARE NEWLY BUILT BASES ON THE 
GROUND THE TROOPS CLEARLY EXPECT 
TO BE HERE FOR SOME TIME 
IN THE CHECHEN CAPITAL GOZ ANY 
THERE IS REAL PROGRESS SHOPPERS 
NOW WALK STREETS THAT WERE JUST 
RUBBLE RUBBLE GROZNY BUT THERE IS STILL A HUGE 
SECURITY PRESENCE AND AS MANY AS 
FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE STILL MISSING TWO 
OF ZARA'S SONS ARE AMONG THEM 
I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TURN TO I NEED TO KNOW WHERE THEY 
ARE I DON'T KNOW HOW I WILL FIND 
OUT WHAT THAT IS WHAT I WANTED TO 
TELL YOU 
THE MINARETS OF A NEW MOSQUE TOUR 
TOWER OVER THE CENTRAL SQUARE 
THERE IS A RENEWED SENSE OF FAITH 
ALONGSIDE THE REBUILDING OF THE 
CITY THE THE TRANSFORMATION OF 
GROZNY IS ASTONISHING BUT IT IS 
NOT COMPLETE ON THE STREETS OF THE 
CITY IN THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE 
THEMSELVES THERE ARE STILL THE 
SCARS OF WAR THERE ARE HUGE 
CHALLENGES IF THE REGION IS TO 
ENJOY ENDURINGING STABILITY AGAIN 
AFTER THE CITY WAS FLATTENED BY A 
BOMB AND SHELL HOUSING IS A HUGE 
PROBLEM THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE 
HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONER THOMAS 
HAMMARBERG HAS VISITED CHECHNYA 
THIS WOMAN'S DREAMS ARE SHARED BY 
THOUSANDS THOUSANDS HOUSING AND A JOB 
EVEN AS LIFE 
IMPROVES MANY BASIC NEEDS ARE 
STILL TO BE MET 
WE MAY SEE A DRASTIC CHANGE FOR THE 
BETTER BY MEANS OF TOTAL 
RECONSTRUCTION BY THE MEANS OF THE 
COMING TOGETHER OF SOCIAL AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ON THE OTHER 
SIDE PEOPLE ARE DEPRESSED THERE IS 
JOBLESSNESS JOBLESSNESS IT IS A PICTURE THAT IS REPEATED 
ACROSS THE REGION WE TRAVELED 
TRAVELLED TO SHATOI HIGH IN THE 
MOUNTAINS OF THE SOUTHERN CHECHNYA 
THOMAS HAMMARBERG GOT CAUCUS CHIC 
TO TAKE HOME 
THE KREMLIN'S FORCES DOMINATE THE 
HEIGHTS THE HILLS ABOVE THE 
VILLAGES WERE REBEL REFUGES 
OFFICIALS SAY THAT NINETY PER CENT OF THE 
BUILDINGS WERE DESTROYED IN THE 
FIGHTING THE REMAINING PROBLEMS 
ARE OBVIOUSLY INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
SECURITY SECURITY INGUSHETIA TOT WEST OF CHECHNYA 
USED TO BE SAFER NO LONGER 
TO THE WEST OF CHECHNYA 
THERE WAS A WARM WELCOME FOR THOMAS 
HAMMARBERG BUT NO HIDING THE 
POTENTIAL DANGER FURTHER ALONG THE 
ROAD WE MET RUSSIAN TROOPS ON 
PATROL MILL TENTS MILITANTS HAVE 
BEEN ACCUSED OF KILLING HERE THERE 
HAVE BEEN EXCESSIVE SITUATIONS 
DURING HIS VISIT THOMAS HAMMARBERG 
RAISED THE ISSUE WITH THE PRESIDENT 
OF INGUSHETIA MURAT ZVAZIKOV HE 
INSISTS THAT HIS SECURITY FORCES 
RESPECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS THOMAS 
HAMMARBERG IS SCEPTICAL AND HAS 
THIS WARNING 
WE ARE RISKING A VICIOUS CYCLE OF 
VIOLENCE THAT SHOULD BE STOPPED 
OTHERWISE INGSHETWRAR RUNS THE 
RISK OF COMING INTO A SITUATION 
THAT CHEM NEAR WAS SOME YEARS AGO 
FAILURE TO AVOID THAT COULD RUIN 
THE LIVES OF ANOTHER GENERATION 
GROWING UP ON RUSSIA RUSSIAA'S 
SOUTHERN EDGE 
NOW THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE MAKES THE LIFE 
DIFFICULT FOR MANY OF THE PEOPLE
