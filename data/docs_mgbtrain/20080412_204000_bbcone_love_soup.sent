I'M DOING SOMETHING I NEVER DONE BEFORE 
GONNA DO IT THIS TIME AIN'T GONNA DO IT NO MORE 
MY ALLEY BOOGIE 
THE ONLY THING I CHOOSE 
THE ONLY THING I DO TO DRIVE AWAY MY BLUES 
NO THIS IS JUST 
I WILL TELL YOU NOW EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR 
OBVIOUSLY I WAS VERY RELUCTANT TO HAVE TO RENT IT OUT BUT 
WITH THE COST OF TRAIN FARES INTO LONDON 
OH IT'S TERRIBLE THEY'VE GONE UP TWICE IN TWO YEA 
ANY MINUTE NOW SHE'LL SEE IT AND THAT'LL BE THAT 
SHE'LL BE STRAIGHT OUT OF THAT DOOR SHE'LL BE SO DISGUSTED 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE HOOVERED THIS WHOLE CARPET 
HOW COULD YOU HAVE MISSED A TOENAIL 
NOW IF I CAN JUST 
HOOK IT INTO THE WOOL OF MY SOCK 
YES SUCCESS 
OH LOOK AT THAT SORRY 
MY CAT'S MOULTING AT THE MOMENT NOW YOU'VE GOT WHITE HAIRS ALL OVER YOUR CUSHIONS 
OH DON'T WORRY 
I TELL YOU WHAT I'VE GOT IS SOME SELLOTAPE IN THE KITCHEN 
OH THAT'LL PROBABLY BE THE POSTMAN 
MORNING TONY MORNING 
HOW ARE YOU VERY GOOD VERY GOOD SIGN THERE PLEASE 
OH LOVELY THIS'LL BE ABOUT THE SERVICE CHARGE I EXPECT 
THREATENING TO IMPOUND MY LIVER AND FEED IT TO THE PRIME MINISTER 
IF I DON'T PAY WOULD YOU LIKE A CUP OF TEA 
WELL ACTUALLY I AM JUST ABOUT FINISHED NOW NEARLY SO YES 
YEAH O. K. THANKS 
IT'S FUNNY I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU LAST NIGHT 
OH REALLY 
WERE YOU WATCHING B. B. C. ONE THIS YOUNG WOMAN WHO GOT SLICED OPEN LIKE A SAUSAGE 
BY SOME MANIAC IN FLATS JUST LIKE THESE 
I DON'T WHERE THEY FILMED IT FOURTH FLOOR SAME AS YOU 
THOUGHT SHE'D LOCKED HERSELF IN ALL SAFE AND SOUND 
THIS PSYCHO CHARACTER GETS ON THE ROOF 
COMES DOWN ON A ROPE LADDER WITH A KNIFE IN HIS MOUTH AND KICKS THE WINDOW IN UH HUH 
SHE HAD NO CHANCE RIGHT 
ERM THIS IS POLLY BY THE WAY 
WHO WILL POSSIBLY BE RENTING MY FLAT IF I MOVE TO LONDON 
SO ERM OH YEAH WHAT I SAID THAT'S NOT REAL LIFE OBVIOUSLY 
COS THAT'S ALL PEOPLE EVER DO ON TELLY AIN'T IT KILLING EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME 
MIND WHERE YOU'RE SITTING 
COS NOW YOU'VE GOT OH LOOK ALL OVER YOUR TROUSERS 
THAT'S ALL MY FAULT COME HERE 
SO THAT WAS THAT 
I HAD TO STAND THERE AND WATCH THEM HAVING SELLOTAPE SEX IN MY OWN SITTING ROOM 
IT TAKES ME THREE WEEKS TO INVITE HIM IN FOR A CUP OF TEA 
SHE MANAGES TO SCORE IN THE FIRST MINUTE 
SO BANG WENT YOUR CHANCE OF RENTING OUT THE FLAT 
WELL NO AMAZINGLY SHE STILL WANTS TO MOVE IN STRAIGHT AWAY 
WHICH'D BE A GODSEND IN ONE WAY COS I'D HAVE ALL THAT MONEY COMING IN 
BUT FINDING SOMEWHERE DIRT CHEAP IN TOWN AT THIS SHORT NOTICE 
COURSE IF I'D KNOWN BEFORE CLEO WENT ON HOLIDAY I COULD HAVE STAYED THERE FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
WELL YOU'RE WELCOME TO THE SOFA AT MY PLACE FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK 
OH REALLY 
BLESS YOU THAT'D MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE 
THE ONLY THING I DON'T KNOW IF I MENTIONED IT ACTUALLY 
BUT YOU KNOW I'VE GOT THIS COUSIN ANTHEA WHO'S AT UNIVERSITY 
DOING SOME KIND OF I DUNNO SOCIOLOGY COURSE OR WHATEVER 
WELL DON'T LAUGH BUT SHE RANG ME UP THE OTHER NIGHT 
TO SEE IF I WANTED TO TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH THEY WERE DOING 
LIKE SOME KIND OF SPECIAL EXPERIMENT 
AND THEY WANTED VOLUNTEERS AT TWO HUNDRED QUID A GO 
SO ALL I HAVE TO DO IS WATCH TWO HOURS OF HARDCORE PORNOGRAPHY EVERY NIGHT 
AND MAKE A NOTE OF MY METABOLIC RESPONSES 
FAIR ENOUGH 
NO NO I DON'T MEAN FAIR ENOUGH DO I 
I MEAN WHAT THE HELL DID YOU JUST SAY HARDCORE PORNOGRA AHEM 
YES HELLO HOW CAN I HELP 
SORRY WE'VE NEVER MET BUT WE 
TALKED ON THE PHONE A FEW WEEKS AGO LLOYD DREWITT THAT AWFUL DAY ABOUT GIL 
OH GOD YES 
ERM YES HOW ARE YOU SUCH A SHOCK THAT WAS 
I MEAN I'M SO SORRY YOU KNOW I HAD TO OH NO NO NO 
NO IT JUST STRUCK ME SUDDENLY WHILE I WAS HERE 
PERFUME COUNTER I REALLY OUGHT TO JUST 
AT LEAST COME AND SAY HELLO 
AND I MEAN IT MUST'VE BEEN FOR YOU SO MUCH WORSE BECAUSE 
DIDN'T HE SAY YOU'D BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS NEARLY 
AND JUST RECENTLY ON THIS NEW SERIES 
YES HE'D WRITTEN ONE OF THE EPISODES WHICH 
IT SOUNDED BRILLIANT THE BITS HE WAS TELLING ME 
JUST THE FIRST TWO SHOWS WHICH OH REALLY 
I MEAN I SAY SCREENING IT'S MORE OF A BIZARRE SACRIFICIAL RITE BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU ALICE 
AFTER EVERYTHING HE TOLD ME I'D VALUE YOUR OPINION MORE THAN ANYBODY'S 
SO WHAT DO WE MAKE OF THIS ONE THEN OVERALL DO WE THINK IT'S WORKING GENERALLY SPEAKING 
A MESS IF YOU WANT MY OPINION 
COMPLETELY RUBBISH STORY WHAT THE HELL WAS IT ALL ABOUT 
I THOUGHT THE CENTRAL CONCEIT THEY WERE SO PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER THEY COULDN'T POSSIBLY EXIST 
O. K. DAVID LYNCH CAN MAKE THAT KIND OF THING WORK WORST OF ALL WHERE WERE THE JOKES 
IF THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A COMEDY GOD HELP US 
O. K. SO POOR NARRATIVE STRUCTURE DIALOGUE OVERINDULGENT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE HUMOUR 
AND HOW DO WE RATE ITS POTENTIAL FOR A SERIES 
STRONG FAIR DOUBTFUL OR ZERO 
SO THERE YOU GO 
OBVIOUSLY WE SHOULD APPLAUD THE DEMOCRATISATION OF OUR INDUSTRY 
AUDIENCE INTERACTIVITY CLEARLY HAS MUCH TO TEACH US 
FOR GOODNESS SAKE HOW CAN THEY JUST SIT THERE LIKE THAT WITHOUT EVEN CRACKING A SMILE 
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE 
WELL I KNOW BUT SADLY WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE A FEW CHANGES TO SHOW WILLING 
THE NAME FOR A START SEEMED TO GO DOWN LIKE A CUP OF COLD SICK 
THEY'RE SAYING IT SOUNDS LIKE A COOKERY PROGRAMME 
BECAUSE OF THE WORD SOUP WHAT ABOUT THE LOVE PART 
YOU CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO READ THE WHOLE TITLE THAT'S TOO MUCH FOR THEIR ATTENTION SPAN 
CURRENT THINKING IS THEY'LL CHERRY PICK A WORD AND IF IT'S WRONG 
THEY CHANGE CHANNEL TO WATCH CELEBRITIES STICK THEIR HEAD UP AN ELEPHANT'S ARSE SO ERM 
AH TALKING OF WHICH HOW'S IT ALL GOING DARE I ASK 
SORRY I'M LATE THERE WAS A TRAIN ON THE LINE PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED 
OH DOUGLAS THIS IS ERM 
OH EXCUSE ME WILL YOU JUST ONE SEC 
OF COURSE HI YOU'LL BE ALICE 
RIGHT YES LLOYD WAS TELLING ME ERM YOU AND GIL 
OH DEAR DREADFUL BUSINESS 
I KNOW I KNOW COS WERE THE TWO OF YOU 
NO FUNNILY ENOUGH NOT REALLY 
WE'D NEVER ERM BUT OBVIOUSLY I KNEW HIS WORK 
WELL THERE'S A TURN UP FOR THE BOOK THEN WHAT DO WE MAKE OF THIS 
HI LLOYD LONG TIME NO SEE IN TOWN ALL WEEK LOVE TO HOOK UP WITH YOU ERICA 
ERICA YEAH YOU REMEMBER THAT TEN HOUR SERIES ONE DID FOR HALLMARK ABOUT THE RENAISSANCE 
SHE WAS A BODY DOUBLE FOR THIS NAKED TORSO 
LOVE TO HOOK UP WITH YOU WONDER IF I DARE THAT PLAY TOMORROW NIGHT ASK HER ALONG 
DON'T THINK SHE'D NEED PERSUADING 
LIKE SHE JUST FELL OUT OF A HELMUT NEWTON CALENDAR 
SHE'LL PROBABLY TURN UP WEARING A PLASTIC G. STRING OR SOMETHING GREAT 
YOU CAN PERFORM ORAL SEX AND FLOSS YOUR TEETH AT THE SAME TIME GIVE IT A GO 
GOD IT'S ANOTHER WORLD ISN'T IT YOUR BUSINESS TRYING TO KEEP US ALL ENTERTAINED 
WITH ALL THE PRESSURES YOU'RE UNDER STILL LLOYD SEEMS TO BE 
FORTUNATELY ON TOP OF IT ALL DOESN'T HE 
YES HE DOES CULTIVATE THAT IMPRESSION BLESS HIM 
ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN OCCASIONS 
WHEN WAS IT ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO HE SET UP THIS SCRIPT MEETING FOR ME WITH ANOTHER PRODUCER IN SOHO 
SO I GO ROUND THERE TO SEE THIS WOMAN IN THIS POKY LITTLE PLACE IN DEAN STREET 
I'M GIVING HER THIS SCREENPLAY I'D JUST WRITTEN TALKING HER THROUGH IT 
AT WHICH SHE JUST COMPLETELY TEARS INTO IT 
LIKE THE WHOLE PLOT AND THE CHARACTERS 
WHAT A SORRY PIECE OF SHIT I AM AS A WRITER MY WORK IS JUST SO WORTHLESS AND PITIFUL 
I'M NOT EVEN FIT TO LICK HER SHOES OR CLEAN OUT HER TOILET 
AND OF COURSE I SUDDENLY REALISE 
HE'S SENT ME TO A PROSTITUTE BY MISTAKE 
WRONG ADDRESS FROM HIS LITTLE BOOK IN SOHO THIS S. AND M. SPECIALIST WHATEVER SHE WAS 
WHO I NOW HAVE TO PAY FOR THE THRILL OF BEING CRUELLY HUMILIATED 
WHICH IS NOT THAT GREAT A STORY EXCEPT WHEN I GET HOME 
I REALISE SOME OF HER COMMENTS WERE ACTUALLY QUITE PERCEPTIVE 
AND MADE MORE SENSE THAN THE NOTES I'D BEEN GETTING FROM THIS SCRIPT EDITOR AT THE B. B. C. SO 
OH OH YEAH UH UH 
GOD YOU SEE THIS ALI IT'S LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY 
FIVE MINUTES THIS WAY FIVE MINUTES THAT WAY TURN HER OVER THEN ANAL THEN ORAL 
SINGLE PENETRATION DOUBLE PENETRATION 
AND WHAT IS IT WITH THE GUY WITHDRAWING BEFORE HE EJACULATES 
THERE LOOK 
LOOK 
WHICH I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT DEFEATS THE WHOLE OBJECT DOESN'T IT 
YOU LIKE THAT 
ANYWAY 
COME ON WHICH D'YOU THINK THE RED OR THE BLUE I NEED A DECISION 
WELL THE RED'S SEXIER NO QUESTION IF YOU WANT TO DO SOME DAMAGE 
SO THE BLUE THEN THANKS 
I MEAN IT'S ONLY THE THEATRE AND AT THIS STAGE I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH I WANT TO ENCOURAGE HIM 
BUT 
I SUPPOSE ALL WILL BECOME CLEAR AS I GO ALONG 
MAYBE I SHOULD BORROW THAT CONTRAPTION FOR THE NIGHT 
THAT'S A POINT I NEED TO CHECK MY AROUSAL RESPONSES HANG ABOUT 
OH OH YOU BITCH 
OH GOD TALK ABOUT CRAPPY EDITING 
I MEAN I'M NO EXPERT ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE ALI BUT WHERE THEY WENT FROM ONE SHOT THERE TO THE NEXT 
HER BOTTOM WAS IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT POSITION EVEN I CAN TELL 
LOOK AT THAT UP IN THE AIR ON HIS FACE 
COME ON THE WHOLE THING'S A COMPLETE PILE OF WANK 
PUT ON BY A LOAD OF PRETENTIOUS TOSSERS WITH VERBAL DIARRHOEA 
GIVE ME A GOOD OLD FASHIONED MUSICAL ANY DAY 
I THINK YOU'RE BEING A BIT HARSH IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE EXPERIMENTAL THEATRE 
I DUNNO ABOUT EXPERIMENTAL MATE IT'S CERTAINLY MENTAL 
I MEAN THAT GEEZER WHO'S PLAYING THE HUSBAND WHAT IS HIS PROBLEM 
IF HE WAS ANY FURTHER UP HIS OWN ARSE HE'D BE INSIDE OOT 
IT'S NO WONDER THE WEST END'S DEAD WHEN YOU HAVE TO COUGH UP FIFTY QUID TO SIT THROUGH THIS SHITE 
TALKING OF WHICH THE CRAPPER CALLS 
I'LL BE BACK WITH YOU GOOD PEOPLE IN A COUPLE OF SHAKES 
I MAY HAVE TO COMMIT SUICIDE THIS IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORST MOMENT OF MY LIFE 
YES WHAT ERM HAPPENED ABOUT THAT GIRL 
OH WHAT YOU MEAN THAT JAW DROPPING SEX QUEEN WHO WROTE TO ME 
WHAT WAS HER NAME ERICA I THINK WASN'T IT 
THAT'S NOT TO BE CONFUSED OF COURSE WITH ERIC A 
OR ERIC ATKINSON MY MOTHER'S COALMAN 
WHO FOR SOME REASON I CAN'T BEGIN TO FATHOM SEEMS TO IMAGINE HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE 
YOU SEE HOW EASILY THESE HILARIOUS MISUNDERSTANDINGS OCCUR THAT WE PUT IN OUR SCRIPTS

YEAH O. K. DO YOU WANT TO 
OH SORRY ALICE 
I'LL LIFT MY FOOT P. 
THAT'S IT OH 
OH ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
RIGHT I'M JUST GONNA PUT YOU INTO BED 
SO BY THEN I WAS FINISHED FOR THE NIGHT 
I THOUGHT SOD IT I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE TILL THE MORNING 
I JUST CRASHED OUT THERE AND THEN ON HER SPARE BED AND THOUGHT I'LL SLIP AWAY FIRST THING 
HA HA 
CURTAINS OPEN 
MORNING HOW YOU FEELING OH GOD 
BIT THE WORSE FOR WEAR SHOULDN'T THAT BE MY LINE 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT LATE NIGHTS AND EARLY MORNINGS 
ALL PART OF THE JOB 
LISTEN THAT WAS BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY LAST NIGHT 
I WAS SO OUT OF IT THE WAY HE GOT ME THOROUGHLY TANKED UP LIKE THAT WHICH IS NO EXCUSE WHATSOEVER 
I BEHAVED LIKE A COMPLETE SHIT AND YOU BEHAVED LIKE A SAINT 
GOD KNOWS WHERE I'D HAVE ENDED UP IN THAT STATE 
SO HE DIDN'T EXACTLY SWEEP YOU OFF YOUR FEET THEN IT'S FAIR TO SAY 
WITH THAT WHATEVER IT WAS THAT SEEMED TO 
RATTLE MY CAGE 
I KNOW TO PUT IT MILDLY NO AND I WONDER WHAT YOUR REACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN ALICE 
AT A CRITICAL ROMANTIC MOMENT TO BE ASKED TO SIGN THIS 
ARE YOU SERIOUS HE WAS EVIDENTLY 
A DATE RAPE WAIVER FORM 
HE SAID THIS FRIEND OF HIS HAD JUST BEEN THROUGH A VERY NASTY COURT CASE 
AS A LOT OF ALCOHOL HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY US HE JUST WANTED TO PUT IT ALL ON A LEGAL FOOTING 
TO GUARD AGAINST ANY REPERCUSSIONS LATER I MEAN STROLL ON 
YOU'LL NOTICE HE'S EVEN GOT MY NAME ALREADY PRINTED ON IT 
I'VE HEARD OF TAKING PRECAUTIONS BEFORE SEX SO YOU THINK IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME 
BEFORE THEY PUT A LITTLE PRINTING MACHINE IN THE GENTS WHERE YOU CAN RUN ONE OF THESE OFF BEFORE YOU 
A A AH 
AND OF COURSE THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME DIDN'T IT 
TALKING TO HER ABOUT ALL THAT IN DOUGLAS'S LOVE LETTER STEAL ICE 
THE WHOLE THING SUDDENLY BECAME CRYSTAL CLEAR 
WHAT DID 
WELL 
I'LL LET YOU KNOW TOMORROW AFTER I'VE SEEN HIM 
WHETHER I WAS RIGHT OR NOT BUT 
STILL NOT SURE WHETHER TO EVEN TELL HIM ABOUT LAST NIGHT 
I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT IT 
ME AND JAKE RANDALL 
THE VERY IDEA 
ANYWAY 
SO WHAT HAVE YOU GOT PLANNED FOR TONIGHT 
SOME MORE POST WATERSHED VIEWING 
OH FINISHED THAT LAST NIGHT THANK GOD 
I TELL YOU IF I'D HAD TO STARE AT ONE MORE CLOSE UP OF A WOMAN'S DWOOZIE 
I THINK I'D HAVE PUT A BRICK THROUGH THAT SCREEN I'M NOT KIDDING 
NO THE THING IS DOUGLAS I WAS THRILLED TO GET IT 
AND THRILLED THAT YOU SHOULD SAY ALL THOSE LOVELY THINGS ABOUT ME 
AND I MEAN YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I MEANT EVERY WORD 
IT'S JUST THAT 
WOULD I BE RIGHT IN SAYING 
YOU'VE ALREADY SENT THIS EXACT SAME LETTER OUT ONCE BEFORE TO A PREVIOUS GIRLFRIEND 
LET'S CALL HER I DON'T KNOW 
AMY 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GOT THE COMPUTER TO CHANGE ALL THE AMYS TO ALICE 
UNFORTUNATELY IT MADE ONE REPLACEMENT TOO MANY 
SO INSTEAD OF THE PHRASE GO ALL HOT AND STEAMY 
WE GET 
GO ALL HOT AND STEALICE 
BUT AS YOU SAY SECOND HAND OR NOT THE SENTIMENT WAS THERE 
AND I DID APPRECIATE IT 
OH OH STOP 
SO WHAT DO WE MAKE OF THIS ONE THEN DO WE THINK IT'S WORKING 
GENERALLY SPEAKING A MESS IF YOU WANT MY OPINION 
WELL THAT'S A BIT EXTREME DON'T YOU THINK 
I MEAN THERE'S AN OBVIOUS LACK OF BALANCE CLEARLY 
HE'S THIS INCURABLE ROMANTIC WHO CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF HER 
AND SHE'S TAKING IT ONE STEP AT A TIME O. K. SHE LIKES HIM BUT THERE'S NO MAGIC THERE 
COS THE REAL MAGIC YOU GET THE FEELING WAS WITH THIS OTHER BLOKE SHE NEVER GOT TO MEET 
COS ON A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL HE REPRESENTS THAT WHOLE WORLD THE OTHER ONE USED TO INHABIT 
SO WEIGHING UP THE LONG TERM PROSPECTS HERE DO WE THINK IT'S GOT LEGS 
OR ARE WE LOOKING AT AS I THINK YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING 
A BRAVE BUT OVER AMBITIOUS AFFAIR THAT'S ULTIMATELY DOOMED TO FAILURE 
MY GOD 
THESE FOCUS GROUPS AREN'T AS STUPID AS YOU THINK 
IS THAT WHAT I'M DOING 
I SUPPOSE IT IS 
DOES IT MATTER THERE'S NO MAGIC 
I MEAN WHAT IS IT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ANYWAY 
AND DOES ANYONE EVER REALLY FIND IT 
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN LIFE I SUPPOSE 
ONLY TIME WILL TELL 
I DONE SANG THIS SONG TILL I SWEAT 
AIN'T NOBODY BOUGHT NO ALLEY BOOGIE YET 
I'M WILD ABOUT MY BOOGIE 
ONLY THING I CRAVE 
SINCE DOING MY ALLEY BOOGIE BEEN DOING THE BOOGIE ALL MY DAYS 
PILING 
ON 
THE 
PRESSURE
