GETTING WORSE I LOST A CONTRACT 
TODAY 
ALSO TONIGHT MORE POLICE TO TODAY STOP THE SPREAD OF TERROR BUT WE 
HEAR WARNINGS THAT MUSLIMS ARE 
BEING DISCOURAGED FROM JOINING UP 
HAS KEN LIVINGSTONE MISSED THE BUS 
ON HIS PLEDGE FOR GREENER PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT IN THE CAPITAL 
PLUS YOU CAN SEE THEM BUT YOU 
CAN'T SMELL THEM THE LATEST 
FLOWERS ADORNING KEW GARDENS 
GOOD EVENING 
THE CURRENT CREDIT CRISIS MAY COST 
LONDON'S FINANCIAL SECTOR AROUND 
FORTY THOUSAND JOBS THAT'S THE WARNING 
BEING ISSUED BY LEADING CITY 
ANALYSTS THE FORECAST FROM U. S. 
INVESTMENT BANK J. P. MORGAN 
ESTIMATES THE JOB LOSSES WILL BE 
THE WORST TO HIT THE CITY SINCE THE 
DOTCOM BUBBLE BURST IN TWO THOUSAND IN A 
MOMENT WE WILL LOOK AT HOW THE 
UNCERTAINTY HAS BEEN SITTING THE 
CAP AT THAT'S HIGH STREETS FIRST 
WE TALK TO CITY WORKERS ABOUT HOW 
IT IS AFFECTING THEM 
IT WON'T 
AFFECT HOW I DO MY JOB BUT I WILL 
BE QUITE WORRIED IT IS THE GENERAL 
CONCERNS IN THE MARKET AS TO HOW 
IT'LL AFFECT TOMORROW MOO IT MIGHT 
BE ME 
AS LONG AS IT IS NOT ON MY 
BACK FINE I'M NOT BOTHERED LIVE LIVE EACH DAY AS YOUR LAST IT IS 
PROBABLY NOT GOOD IT WOULDN'T 
AFFECT ME NO 
I'M A FINANCIAL 
JOURNALIST SO IT'LL AFFECT THE A 
STORIES I HAVE TO RIGHT ABOUT THE 
STATE OF THE INDUSTRY 
WE CAN CROSS 
TO PAUL CURRAN YOU HAVE BEEN 
LOOKING AT HOW THIS FINANCIAL 
CLIMATE IS BEING PLAYED OUT ON 
LONDON'S HIGH STREETS ARE YOU 
BUSINESSING SEEING A DOWNTURN YES YES SOME BUSINESSES ARE CERTAINLY 
SEEING LESS MONEY COMING THEIR WAY 
BUT NOT EVERYONE IS REPORTING A 
FALL IT ALL DEPENDS REALLY ON 
WHAT SORT OF BUSINESS YOU ARE IN 
AND TO SOME EXTENT WHERE YOUR 
BUSINESS IS GEOGRAPHICALLY ONE 
THING THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON IS 
THEY ARE ALL WORRIED ABOUT THE 
PROSPECTS FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS 
TODAY I WENT OUT TO FIND SOME 
PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THE SHARP END OF 
THE ECONOMY THOSE WHO ARE LIKELY 
TO SEE A SHARP DOWNTURN FIRST 
NICOLA GIBSON KNOWS THROUGH BITTER 
EXPERIENCE THAT THE ECONOMY IS 
SUFFERING BUSINESS AT HER FLOWER 
SHOP IN HAMP STEAD IS DEFINITELY 
DOWN ONLY TODAY ONE OF HER BIGGER 
CUSTOMERS CANCELLED THEIR REGULAR 
ORDER 
IT HAS BEEN AFFECTED IN THE ORDER WAY OUR WEEKLY CONTRACTS SUCH AS 
PUBS THAT WOULD HAVE FLOWERS EVERY 
WEEK ARE CUTTING THE BUDGET 
CONSIDERABLY OR STOPPING FLOWERS 
AS IT IS A LUXURY ITEM IF THEY 
HAVE TO MAKE CUTBACKS IT IS THE 
FIRST THING THAT HAS TO STOP TRADE TRADE AT THIS RESTAURANT IN CROUCH SEND 
STILL GOOD HE IS NOT PASSING ON 
HIS HIGHER COSTS TO CUSTOMERS 
PROFITS ARE DOWN HE XMENTS OTHER 
RESSTRAUNDS TO CLOSE 
ANOTHER HE 
EXPECTS OTHER RESTAURANTS TO CLOSE 
ANOTHER PROBABLE WITH CROUCH SEND 
THE RENTS HAVE GONE SKY HIGH THE 
RENTS ARE NOT RELATED IT THE TRADE 
YEARS AGO WHEN I MOVED TO CROUCH 
END THEY WERE TOOKING ABOUT 
THIRTEEN THOUSAND RENT IF YOU MOVE TO THE 
CLOCK TOWER YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 
FIFTY THOUSAND RENT 
WITH YEARS EXPERIENCE 
AS AN ESTATE AGENT MR. HOWARD HAS 
SEEN GOOD AND BAD TIMES HE HAS NO 
DOUBT THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WILL BE 
BAD AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE FEWER 
BUYERS AND HE EXPECTS SOME ESTATE 
AGENTS WILL GO UNDER 
I THINK SOME 
OF THE BIG CORPORATES SADLY THEY 
HAVE A HABIT OF LAYING PEOPLE OFF 
QUINGLY FIRST IN FIRST OUT THE 
PROBLEM FOR SOME OF THE YOUNGSTERS 
IS THEY ARE NOT EXPERIENCED 
EFFECTIVELY THEY HAVE BEEN ORDER 
TAKERS THE PHONE IS RINGING YOU 
PICK IT UP MAKE AN APPOINTMENT 
WHEN DO YOU WANT TO BUY THAT'S NOT 
THE CASE NOW YOU HAVE TO WORK HARD 
ACCORDING TO STEVE THE LAST FEW 
WEEKS HAVE BEEN QUIET HE BLAMES 
THAT ON THE EXTENDED EASTER 
HOLIDAYS HE IS NOT CONVINCED IT IS 
ALL DOOM AND GLOOM BUT WORRYINGLY 
HAS SEEN COMPANIES CUTTING BACK 
ONE OF THE MAJOR BANKS IN THE CITY 
THAT USE THE CIRCUIT I'M ON AT NINE HUNDRED 
AT NIGHT IF YOU WORKED AFTER THAT 
THEY GAVE AWE CAB THEY HAVE PUSHED 
IT TO ONE THOUSAND P. M. IT IS LITTLE CUTS 
LIKE THAT THAT YOU ARE BEGINNING TO 
NOTICE 
AS YOU HEARD SOME PEOPLE NOTICE ARE EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS BUT NOT 
EVERYONE IN SOME CASES I HAVE BEEN 
TOLD THAT THERE IS GOOD TIMES AT 
THE MOMENT ACCORDING TO SOMEBODY I 
KNOW IN THE RESSTPRAUNT AND PUB 
TRADE TOURIST AREAS IN CENTRAL 
LONDON ARE DOING WELL RESTAURANTS 
THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE 
EUROPEAN VISITORS BECAUSE OF THE 
RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE EURO 
AGAINST THE POUND 
PLENTY MORE AHEAD INCLUDING FROM 
THE EAST END TO THE WEST END 
LETITA DEAN JOINS THE CAST OF THE 
CULT MUSICAL HIGH SCHOOL REUNION 
A SENIOR MET POLICE OFFICER SAYS 
YOUNG MUSLIMS ARE BEING DISCOURAGED 
FROM JOINING THE FORCE BECAUSE OF 
OBSTACLES IN THE RECRUITMENT 
PROCESS COMMANDER ALI DIZAEI 
COMMENTS COME ON THE DAY THE HOME 
SECRETARY ANNOUNCED A GOVERNMENT 
SCHEME TO EMPLOY THREE HUNDRED EXTRA OFFICERS 
TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF 
RADICALISATION GUY SMITH REPORTS 
WHITECHAPEL THIS AFTERNOON ONE OF 
THE MOST DIVERSE AREAS IN LONDON 
CONVINCING PEOPLE HERE TO JOIN THE 
POLICE CAN BE A CHALLENGE IF THE 
MET IS TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF 
REPRESENTING THOSE IT'S EXPECTED TO 
SERVE THEN IT HAS IT WIN OVER 
HEARTS AND MINDS 
IF THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE MORE 
RELAXED TOWARDS THE MUSLIM 
COMMUNITIES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS 
COMMUNITIES THERE MIGHT BE MORE 
PEOPLE THAT WILL BE INTERESTED TO 
JOIN 
WE SEE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY JOIN OUR NEIGHBOURS AND PEOPLE BEING 
CHECKED WE DON'T FEEL WE ARE 
TREATED QUITE FAIRLY SO GOD FORBID 
WE ACTUALLY JOIN THE POLICE FORCE 
THIS MAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
POLICING THE WHOLE OF WEST LONDON 
HE IS ALSO MUSLIM HE SAYS THERE 
ARE STILL TOO MANY OBSTACLES IN THE 
WAY DEFEVERING YOUNG MUST LIPS TO 
JOIN UP 
JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY 
VISITS ANOTHER COUNTRY SEVERAL 
TIMES DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE 
THEM A RISK WE NEED TO BE QUITE 
CAREFUL TO ENSURE OUR VETTING 
PROCEDURES ARE NON BIASED AND ARE 
FAIR AND THEY ENSURE WE GET THE 
BEST PEOPLE INTO THE JOB WITHOUT 
COMPROMISING NATIONAL SECURITY IT IT CAN TAKE UP TO THREE MONTHS FOR 
SECURITY CHECKS BEFORE BEING 
ACCEPTED AS A POTENTIAL RECRUIT 
EVEN THEN YOU HAVE TO OVERCOME THE 
STIGMA SOMETIMES ATTACHED TO BEING 
A POLICE OFFICER YOU ONLY HAVE TO 
LOOK BACK AT THE COUNTER TERRORISM 
RAIDS IN FOREST GATE TWO YEARS AGO 
AND THE DAMAGE TO COMMUNITY 
RELATIONS THIS MUSLIM SCHOLAR 
BELIEVES THERE SHOULD BE NO 
BARRIERS TO SIGNING UP OFFICERS 
NEED TO UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES THE 
CULTURAL DIFFERENCES TO AVOID 
ALIENATING PEOPLE 
THE MUSLIM 
COMMUNITY FEEL IT IS VERY WRONG FOR 
A MALE TO SUCH ANY FEMALE MUSLIM 
WOMAN OR INDIVIDUAL IF WE HAD 
MUSLIMS IN THE ANTI TERRORISM UNIT 
WHO COULD BE DETECTIVES IN THAT 
ARENA THEY WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO 
GIVE THE RELEVANT EDUCATION TO 
RELEVANT COLLEAGUES 
BUT TO BECOME 
A COUNTER TERRORISM OFFICER YOU 
NEED FIRST TO BE A DETECTIVE IN 
THE MET THERE ARE ONLY AN ESTIMATED 
THREE HUNDRED MUSLIM OFFICERS HALF HAVING 
LESS THAN THREE YEARS' EXPERIENCE 
SO A STICKING POINT SOME SAY IN 
COMBATING TERRORISM YET THIS WOMAN 
HAS JUST STARTED HER CAREER SHE 
SAYS MUSLIMS SHOULDN'T BE PUT OFF 
I FEEL THEY HAVE MET MY NEEDS IN 
TERMS OF PRAYER AND I KNOW OTHER 
MUSLIMS LAST YEAR WHEN I WASN'T 
HERE WHEN THEY HAD RAMADAN THEY 
CHANGED THE SHIFT FOR THEM AS WELL 
THE MET ACCEPTS THERE IS AN ISSUE 
AND ARE ACTIVELY RECRUITING IN FIVE 
OF THE CAPITAL'S MOST DIVERSE 
BOROUGHS MUSLIMS TOP OF THEIR 
AGENDA AGENDA THE MET SAYS CRIME IN THE CAPITAL 
HAS FALLEN BY SIX PER CENT OVER THE LAST YEAR 
LATEST FIGURES SHOW ROBBERY DOWN 
NINETEEN PER CENT AND RAPE DOWN SEVENTEEN PER CENT VIOLENT 
CRIME AND MURDERS ALSO FELL 
DESPITE THE RECORD NUMBER OF 
TEENAGE KILLINGS THE ONLY INCREASE 
HAS BEEN IN SO CALLED TRIDENT GUN 
CRIME GUN VIOLENCE IN BLACK 
COMMUNITIES KEN LIVINGSTONE HAS 
WELCOMED THE FIGURES AS THE BEST IN 
A DECADE BORIS JOHNSTON AND BRIAN 
PADDICK SAID THE STATISTICS WERE 
UNRELYAL AND MUCH CRIME IS BEING 
UNREPORTED UNREPORTED A NEW POSTMORTEM REPORT INTO THE 
DEATH OF A SURREY STUDENT KILLED IN 
ITALY LAST YEAR HAS CONCLUDED SHE 
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN RAPED MEREDITH 
KERCHER WHO WAS TWENTY ONE AND FROM 
COULDSON WAS FOUND WITH HER THROAT 
CUT IN HER IN THE CITY OF PERUGIA 
IN NOVEMBER THREE PEOPLE ARE BEING 
HELD ON SUSPICION OF HER MURDER 
THE THE OF A TWO YEAR OLD KILLED BY A SPEEDBOAT IN THE BAHAMAS HAS 
TOLD THE COURT OF THE MOMENT SHE 
SAW THE INJURIES TO HER SON'S HEAD 
PAUL GALLAGHER WAS SLEEPING ON A 
SUN LOUNGER WHEN A CRAFT MOUNTED A 
BEACH AND PLOUGHED INTO HIM IN 
AUGUST TWO HOUD TWO HIS MOTHER 
ANDREA BROKE DOWN IN TEARS AS SHE 
GAVE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE THREE MEN 
CHARGED WITH MANSLAUGHTER WHO DENY 
THE CHARGES 
AN INQUEST HAS OPENED INTO THE 
DEATH OF TELEVISION PRESENTER MARK 
SPEIGHT WHOSE BODY WAS FOUND 
HANGING IN PADDINGTON STATION ON 
SUNDAY THE INQUEST HEARD TWO 
SUICIDE NOTES HAVE BEEN RETRIEVED 
KATHERINE CARPENTER IS AT THE 
STATION WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US 
WELL THERE WERE MANY OF THE USUAL 
FORMALITIES TODAY MARK SPEIGHT'S 
BODY WAS FOUND ON TOP OF AN OFFICE 
BLOCK AROUND THE CORNER FROM HERE 
TODAY IT WAS CONFIRMED TO THE 
CORONER THAT THE POSTMORTEM 
DISCOVERED THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH 
WAS HANGING IT WAS ALSO CONFIRMED 
THAT THE POLICE WEREN'T TREATING 
HIS DEATH ADDS SUSPICIOUS AND THE 
CORONER REVEALED AS SUSPICIOUS 
AND THE CORONER REVEALED TWO 
SUICIDE NOTES HAD BEEN FOUND ONE 
ON HIS BODY THE OTHER AT HIS FLAT 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF QUESTIONS THAT 
HAVEN'T YET BEEN ANSWERED SUCH AS 
HOW LONG HAD MR. SPEIGHT'S BODY BEEN 
LEFT UNDISCOVERED HE WAS LAST SEEN 
IN C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE AT WOOD GREEN 
POLICE STATION ALMOST A WEEK BEFORE 
HIS DEATH AND SOME REPORTS SAY THE 
JOURNEY HE TOOK THAT DAY MAY HAVE 
BEEN HIS LAST 
HIS DEATH APPARENTLY 
TRIGGERED BY ANOTHER PERSONAL 
TRAGEDY 
YES THAT'S RIGHT FRIENDS TRAGEDY AND FAMILY HAD BEEN VERY CONCERNED 
ABOUT MR. SPEIGHT'S STATE OF MIND 
SINCE THE DEATH OF HIS FIANCEE 
NATASHA COLLINS BACK IN JANUARY HE 
FOUND HER BODY A POSTMORTEM INTO 
HER DEATH FOUND SHE SKIED FROM 
SKALDING AND A DRUGS OVER DOSE 
TODAY THE CORONER SAID THIS WHOLE 
AFFAIR HAD BEEN A DOUBLE STRATEGY 
NOW TO THE MAYORAL ELECTIONS NOW 
AND BORIS JOHNSTON MAY HAVE RUN 
INTO PROBLEMS WITH HIS BUS PLANS 
NOW KEN LIVINGSTONE FACES 
ACCUSATIONS THAT HE TOO HAS HIS 
SUMS WRONG IN HIS MANIFESTO HE 
PROIMSS FIVE HUNDRED PART DIESLE PART 
ELECTRIC BUSES UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TEN TODAY HE 
SAID IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
ONLY THEN IF CURRENT TRIALS ARE 
SUCCESSFUL WE REPORT ON THE 
CRUCIAL CAMPAIGN ISSUE OF TRANSPORT 
IT IS AN AREA WHERE THE MAYOR HAS 
HUGE INFLUENCE OVER TEN YEARS 
THERE WILL BE THIRTY NINE BILLION INVESTED 
ALREADY THERE ARE RECORD TUBE 
PASSENGERS A BILLION YEAR BUS 
PASSENGERS ARE AT THEIR HIGHEST 
SINCE ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX FIVE THE CHALLENGE IS THAT 
THOSE NUMBERS WILL INCREASE THERE 
ARE ALSO PROJECTS LIKE CROSSRAIL 
THAT NEED TO BE BROUGHT IN ON 
BUDGET AND ON TIME 
IT IS GETTING A BIT WORSE THE 
BUSES THE TUBES AREN'T TOO BAD 
TUBES FOUR FOR A SINGLE IF YOU JUST 
WANT TO GO TWO OR THREE STOPS IT IS 
A LITTLE RIDICULOUS 
THERE IS 
CONSENSUS AMONGST THE THREE MAIN 
CANDIDATES THEY ALL WANT MORE 
EFFICIENT TRAINS AND BUSES AND 
CROSSRAIL THEY ALL WANT A PARIS 
STYLE CYCLE HIRE SCHEME AND TRAMS 
ALONG OXFORD STREET AND THEY'D ALL 
RETAIN THE CONGESTION CHARGE 
SO HOW SUCCESSFUL HAS IT BEEN 
FIGURES SHOW THAT SEVENTY THOUSAND FEWER 
VEHICLES A DAY ENTER CENTRAL LONDON 
COMPARED TO TWO THOUSAND TWO BUT CRITICS SAY 
THE JAMS ARE NOW ALMOST AS BAD AS 
THEY HAVE EVER BEEN AND THE SYSTEM 
ITSELF COSTS TOO MUCH TO RUN BUT 
ITS SUPPORTERS SAY IF IT WASN'T FOR 
THE CONGESTION CHARGE THE JAMS 
WOULD BE MUCH MUCH WORSE AND THEY 
BLAME ROADWORKS BUT FROM OCTOBER 
IF LIVINGSTONE WINS THE CONGESTION 
CHARGE BECOMES A CO TWO CHARGE GAS 
GUZZLERS WILL HAVE TO PAY TWENTY FIVE WITH 
LOW EMITTING CARS FREE BOTH 
JOHNSTON AND PADDICK WOULD SCRAP 
THAT THE WESTERN EXTENSION COULD 
ALSO GO 
PADDICK WOULD ALSO INTRODUCE A TEN 
CHARGE FOR GREATER LONDON FOR 
THOSE LIVING OUTSIDE 
I THINK THE CANDIDATES NEED TO LOOK 
AT BOTTLENECKS IN LONDON JUNCTION 
IMPROVEMENTS ARE RELATIVELY 
INEXPENSIVE THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT 
THE BUSES IT IS GREAT THAT WE HAVE 
MORE BUSES BUT IN SOME AREAS BUSES 
ARE CAUSING CONGESTION 
ON THE TUBE 
ALL WANT MORE INVESTMENT PADDICK'S 
PROPOSING A GUARD ON WOMEN FRIENDLY 
CARRIAGES JOHNSTON WANTS IT OPEN 
AN HOUR LATER ON THE WEEKEND AND A 
NO STRIKE DEAL WITH UNIONS THAT'S 
BEEN DISMISSED BY THEM KEN 
LIVINGSTONE SAYS HE'LL CONTINUE TO 
MODERNISE THE SYSTEM 
THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN IS 
OVERCROWDING PATRONAGE ON BOTH THE 
TUBE AND HEAVY RAIL IS GROWING AT 
PHENOMENAL RATES EIGHT PER CENT PER ANNUM 
THAT CAN'T COPE WITH THE SYSTEM AT 
THE MOMENT EVEN WHEN CROSSRAIL AND 
THAMESLINK COME ONSTREAM THEY WILL 
ONLY SOAK UP SOME OF THE INCREASES 
IN THE USAGE 
BUSES ARE A KEY 
ELECTION ISSUE IN HIS MANIFESTO 
KEN LIVINGSTONE PLEDGES FIVE HUNDRED HYBRID 
BUSES AT A COST OF NINETY MILLION BUT 
INDUSTRY SOURCES HAVE TOLD US THE 
COST WILL BE MORE LIKE ONE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION 
UNLESS IT IS SPREAD OVER A LARGE 
ORDER AND WHILE THE LIVINGSTONE 
MANIFESTO SAYS HE'LL DELIVER THEM 
BY TWO THOUSAND TEN TODAY HE SAID IT WOULD BE 
MORE LIKE TWENTY TWELVE 
WE HOPE TO HAVE 
FIVE HUNDRED BY THE TIME WE HIT THE OLYMPICS 
AND THEN REALLY TO REPLACE THE 
WHOLE FLEET OVER THE YEARS TO COME 
BUT AT THE MOMENT THERE IS ONLY ONE 
IN THE WORLD WHICH WE ARE TRIALLING 
PADDICK SAYS HE'D INVEST IN TRAMS 
WHILE BORIS JOHNSTON WANTS THE 
BENDY BUS PHASED OUT AND REPLACED 
WITH A NEW ROUTEMASTER BUT HIS EIGHT 
MILLION FIGURE FOR CONDUCTORS 
EXPERTS SAY IS TOO LOW 
YOU ARE NOT 
GOING TO GET MANY CONDUCTORS FOR EIGHT 
MILLION AT ALL IT IS NOT JUST ONE 
CONDUCTOR FOR EACH BUS YOU ARE 
PROBABLY GOING TO NEED THREE OR 
FOUR CONDUCTORS PER PUSS BUS IT'S IT'S BEEN CALLED THE SECOND GOLDEN AGE 
OF THE CAPITAL'S PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
AND WHOEVER WIN ALSO OVERSEE HUGE 
INVESTMENT IN LONDON'S TRANSPORT 
INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE AND HERE IS A LIST OF ALL THE 
CANDIDATES STANDING MORE DETAILS 
ON THEIR POLICIES AND HOW TO VOTE 
ON OUR WEBSITE 
WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO RECORD YOUR 
QUESTION ON A CAMERA OR A TELEPHONE 
AND UPLOADED TO THE ELECTION 
CHANNEL ON YOUTUBE WE WOULD BE 
PUTTING THE BEST QUESTIONS TO 
CANDIDATES NEXT WEEK 
WITH WHAT THESE PICTURES INSPIRE 
YOU TO JUMP FROM BUILDING TO 
BUILDING WE TALKED TO ONE MAN WHO 
HAS TAKEN UP THE RUNNING AS A 
COMPETITIVE SPORT FREERUNNING 
VISITORS TO KEW GARDENS ARE USED TO 
BEING TREATED TO SOME OF THE 
WORLD'S FINEST AND MOST RARE PLANTS 
BUT NOW A NEW MUSEUM THERE WILL 
OFFER AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT 
BOTANICAL EXPERIENCE THIS TIME OF 
ITS PAINTINGS SKETCHES AND 
DRAWINGS MANY ON DISPLAY FOR THE 
FIRST TIME HOW DO THEY LOOK THEY THEY ABSOLUTELY STUNNING AS YOU SAY 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME SOME OF THEM 
HAVE BEEN ON DISPLAY L. WAS 
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE THEM LOOK 
AT THE ART WORK EARLIER THIS 
AFTERNOON SOME OF THE PEOPLE I'VE 
SPOKEN TO EXPLAIN THE REAL HISTORY 
BEHIND THE PAINTINGS 
DOCTOR SHIRLEY 
SHERWOOD HAS BEEN COLLECTING 
BOTANICAL ART FROM ALL OVER THE 
WORLD FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS FOR HER 
THE PAINTINGS ARE A BEAUTIFUL BLEND 
OF SCIENCE AND ART 
THEY'RE ALL 
SCIENTIFICALLY CORRECT BUT IT'S 
THAT EXTRA SOMETHING THAT BRILLIANT 
ARTISTS GAVE SOTHEBY'S ARE WORKS OF 
ART AS WELL AS A SCIENTIFIC 
ANALYSIS OF A PLANT THESE ARE 
PLANT PORTRAITS 
MANY 
TELL A STORY SOME WORKS ARE ROB 
TRADITIONAL BRITISH PLANTS AND 
FLOWERS GOING BACK TO THE SIXTEENTH 
CENTURY SOME ARE MORE EXOTIC THIS 
PAINTING WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE 
EAST INDIA COMPANY WHO GOT LOCAL 
INDIAN ARTISTS TO DO THEIR WORK 
SOMETIMES IT LOOKS MORE WESTON 
SOMETIMES MORE EASTERN BUT THESE 
GUYS WHEN THEY ARE COLLECTING THEIR 
OFTEN COLLECTED SPECIMENS AS WELL 
WHEN THEY RETURNED TO BRITAIN THEY 
WOULD BRING THIS COLLECTION WITH 
THEM 
AND DESPITE THEIR SUBJECT THEM MATTER THESE DELICATE WATERCOLOURS 
HAVE TO BE TREATED WITH CARE THERE THERE ARE A BORE HOLES THAT GO VERY DEEP 
INTO THE GROUND THAT HAVE TO 
REGULATE THE TEMPERATURE THESE ARE 
VERY FRAGILE WORKS OF ART AND NEED 
TO BE DISPLAYED AT A LOW LIGHT 
LEVELS IN VERY CONTROLLED HUMIDITY 
SO THAT THE TECHNICAL ENVIRONMENT 
OF THE BUILDING IS VERY IMPORTANT 
AS YOU HER BED THE TECHNICALITIES 
OF THIS BUILDING ARE INCREDIBLY 
IMPORTANT TO THE PAINTINGS 
THEMSELVES HEREIN FRONT OF ME IS 
ONE OF THE ART WORKS IT'S CALLED 
OUR SENIOR CONTRA SENIOR I'M NOT 
AN EXPERT ON FLOWERS BUT WHAT I CAN 
SEE IS INCREDIBLE DETAIL YOU DON'T 
GET WHEN YOU ARE WALKING THROUGH 
KEW GARDENS ITSELF THERE ARE 
HUNDREDS OF PAINTINGS HERE SOME OF 
THEM PICTURES YOU MAY RECOGNISE AND 
SOME OF THEM NOT ONE OF THE WOMEN 
WHO'VE MADE IT ALL POSSIBLE IS WITH 
ME THIS EVENING LAURA YOU ARE THE 
CURATOR WHAT WENT INTO THIS IT'S IT'S A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE AN 
OPPORTUNITY FOR VISITORS TO SEE 
WORKS PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN AT KEW 
GARDENS TOGETHER WITH DOCTOR 
SHERWOOD'S COLLECTION OF 
CONTEMPORARY ART 
WHY SHOULD PEOPLE 
SEE IT 
IT'S A ONCE IN A LIFETIME

SHE TAKES TO THE STAGE JOINING THE 
CAST OF HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL THE 
PRE TEEN PHENOMENON THAT BOASTS TWO HUNDRED 
MILLION FANS AROUND THE WORLD

SOMETHING NEW FOR LETITIA DEAN BE 
HARD PUT TO PORN ACTRESSES JOINING 
THE RANKS OF HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 
THE STAGE SHOW WHEN IT OPENS IN 
HAMMERSMITH IN JUNE HIGH SCHOOL 
MUSICAL IS MASSIVE DID YOU HAVE 
ANY CONCEPT AS TO JUST HOW BIG IT 
WAS BEFORE YOU GOT INVOLVED 
A NEW 
WAS VERY POPULAR BUT IT WASN'T 
UNTIL I SPOKE TO MY FRIENDS' 
CHILDREN AND TOLD THEM I WAS GOING 
TO BE DOING IT MY KUDOS WENT 
THROUGH THE ROOF YOU'RE GOING TO 
BE IN HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL L. DIDN'T 
REALISE HOW HUGE IT WAS IT'S AN 
HONOUR TO BE PART OF IT 
LET ME 
TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON 
I CAN SEE 
WHAT'S GOING ON DENNIS PATRICIA PATRICIA IS BEST KNOWN FOR PLAYING SHARON 
WATTS IN EASTENDERS AND MORE 
RECENTLY AS A COMPETITOR IN 
STRICTLY COME DANCING DESPITE A 
SUCCESSFUL CAREER THIS LATEST ROLE 
WASN'T HANDED TO HER ON A PLATE 
HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN THIS 
DID THEY JUST BRING YOU UP AND SAY 
THEY HAD THIS ROLE FOR YOU 
NO I 
HAD TO AUDITION IT'S A WENT DOWN 
AND SAID LOOK MY AMERICAN ACCENT 
ISN'T VERY GOOD THEY GOT ME A 
VOICE COACH THE DAY BEFORE AND GAVE 
ME A COUPLE OF HOURS' WORK L. PUT 
IT DOWN ON FILM AND THEY HAD TO 
SEND IT OFF TO THE POWERS THAT BE 
IT WAS JUST AFTER EASTER THAT I GOT 
THE PHONE BY AGE AND SAID I'VE GOT 
THE PART L. THOUGHT NO 
SO HOW 
WILL SHE COPE WITH THE LIVE THEATRE 
AUDIENCE EVERY DAY 
THE THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEATER 
AT HAMMERSMITH IS GOING TO BE ORSON 
BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE THE REACTION 
STRAIGHTAWAY IF I EVER THOUGHT AT 
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE AT ONE TIME OR 
WATCHING EASTENDERS WERE IN THE 
THEATRE I THINK I WOULD HAVE 
PASSED OUT 
LETITIA DEAN'S LATEST 
VENTURE LOOKS SET TO BE THIS 
SUMMER'S LATEST BOCK BLOCKBUSTER 
AS WE SAW THERE IT'S NOT UNUSUAL 
FOR TELEVISION TO SPOT AN INTEREST 
IN SOMETHING YOU'VE NEVER TRIED FOR 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS FREERUNNING 
HAS BECOME AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR 
URBAN SPORT WITH CHAMPIONSHIPS 
TAKING PLACE THIS SUMMER MATTHEW 
MORRIS HAS BEEN TO MEET ONE MAN WHO 
SAYS HE WAS INSPIRED TO TAKE UP THE 
SPORT AFTER WATCHING THESE B. B. C. 
PICTURES 
GOING FOR A QUIET STROLL THIS IS 
NOT FORGET THE JOB AND THINK FREE 
RUN NO GYM MEMBERSHIP REQUIRED 
JUST THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT AND A 
GOOD PAIR OF TRAINERS 
AND LIKE TO 
DO IT BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT YOU 
DON'T SEE MANY PEOPLE DO THIS YOU 
SEE THIS TYPE OF STUFF IN MOVIES A 
LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SIT IN THE 
CINEMA AND WISH THEY COULD DO IT 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CHIMA IS A STUDENT A 
FREE RUNNER AND IT HAS TO BE SAID 
A BIT OF PACE SHOW OFF WE'RE WE'RE PERFORMING FOR THE PUBLIC FREE OF 
CHARGE AS WELL AS US PRACTISING 
FOR OLMERT SAKE 
SO IT'S THEIR FREE 
GIFT TO US ALL BUT NOT EVERYONE 
WILL WANT TO ACCEPT IT 
WE WOULD 
NEVER JUMP OFF SOMEONE'S CAR OR 
ENTER PRIVATE PROPERTY IT'S KIND 
OF PEOPLE THINK FREERUNNING IS 
RANDOMLY BEING RUTHLESS AND JUMPING 
AROUND ANYWHERE WE DON'T REALLY DO 
THAT WE'VE GOT SPECIALIST PLACES 
WE DO THAT EVEN WHEN PEOPLE COME 
AND SPEAK TO US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT 
WE'RE DOING WE TALK TO THEM 
POLITELY AND TELL THEM THAT IT IS 
JUST AN ART OF MOVEMENT 
CHIMA IS 
HOPING TO COMPETE IN THE FIRST EVER 
FREERUN CHAMPIONSHIP DUE TO BE 
HELD IN CAMDEN IN SEPTEMBER IT'S IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY OF MEETING OTHER 
PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD 
COMING TOGETHER AND EXPRESSING 
MOVEMENT YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO TAKE 
YOUR TIME BE CAREFUL NEVER JUST 
ASSUME THAT IT'S GOING TO BE O. K. 
ALWAYS CHECK IF YOU DON'T KNOW 
WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU WILL ENJOY 
YOURSELF 
THE QUEUE LIKE MAKING THE YOURSELF MOST OF YOUR CONCRETE IT COULD BE 
FOR YOU IF YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE 
DON'T TRY IT AT HOME AMAZING

DISAPPEAR QUITE QUICKLY ONCE THE 
SUN SETS A LOT OF THIS CLOUD WILL

THING THAT WON'T DISAPPEAR IS THE 
BREEZE IF ANYTHING THAT WILL GET 
STRONGER THAT IS GOING TO KEEP THE 
AIR MIXED IT MEANS IT WON'T GET
