FINDING A PROPERTY FOR SOME PEOPLE IS JUST WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE 
FOR OTHERS A BRIDGE TOO FAR 
AND WITH SO MUCH INFORMATION FLOATING AROUND 
YOU NEED HELP TO SWIM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
AND NOT GET INTO DEEP WATER 
SO RATHER THAN SWANNING AROUND ALL THOSE ESTATE AGENTS 
AND DUCKING THE ISSUE JUST CALL US 
YOU'D BE QUACKERS NOT TO BECAUSE 
TO TRY BEFORE YOU BUY 
HELLO HELLO 
TODAY WE'RE IN THE LEAFY 
SOUTHERN OUTSKIRTS OF NOTTINGHAM RIGHT BESIDE THE RIVER TRENT 
AND JUST OVER THERE IS NOTTINGHAM FOREST FOOTBALL CLUB 
THEN JUST BETWEEN THE TREES ARE THEIR ARCH RIVALS NOTTS COUNTY 
LET ME TELL YOU THIS THEY'RE THE CLOSEST LEAGUE FOOTBALL GROUNDS IN ENGLAND 
AMAZING AND WE'RE HERE IN THIS DESIRABLE SUBURB TO FIND THE PERFECT HOME 
FOR A LOVELY YOUNG COUPLE WITH AN EXPANDING FAMILY 
YEP WE'RE GONNA SHOW THEM THREE PROPERTIES 
WE'LL LET THEM TEST DRIVE ONE AND THEN IT'S DECISION TIME 
TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
OUR HOUSE HUNTERS TODAY ARE KIERAN AND SUSANNA TYNAN 
KIERAN IS A MEDICAL SALES REP HE SELLS KEYHOLE SURGERY EQUIPMENT 
TO HOSPITALS SO HE NEEDS A GARAGE FOR STORAGE 
AND EASY ACCESS TO THE M. ONE 
SUSANNA IS A TRAINING CONSULTANT WHO SPECIALISES IN THE AUTO TRADE 
THEY'RE BOTH BIG MOVIE FANS 
AND REGULARLY TURN THEIR LIVING ROOM INTO A CINEMA 
THEY HAVE A YEAR OLD DAUGHTER LILY MAY 
AND THERE'S A NEW ARRIVAL ON THE WAY HEY THAT RHYMES 
SO AFTER EIGHT YEARS 
THEY NEED A NEW PAD AND QUICKLY THEY'D LIKE A PROPERTY 
THEY CAN TURN INTO THEIR NEXT FAMILY HOME 
SO SUSANNA KIERAN HERE WE ARE IN YOUR LOVELY FAMILY HOME MM HMM 
WHY ARE WE MOVING WE'RE A GROWING FAMILY 
O. K. RAPIDLY I HAD NOTICED O. K. SO HOW LONG UNTIL 
IT'S HALF COOKED O. K. SO YOU'RE HALFWAY THERE 
HALFWAY THERE AND WE'VE ALREADY GOT ONE LITTLE GIRL WOW LILY MAY 
THINGS HAVE TO MOVE ON THEN THEY HAVE YES GOT TO FIND A NEW ABODE WITH PRESUMABLY 
MORE SPACE MORE SPACE O. K. GROWING FAMILY 
THAT'S THE KEY SO HOW MANY BEDROOMS ARE YOU LOOKING FOR 
IDEALLY FOUR BECAUSE WE USE ONE AS A STUDY 
RIGHT SO FOUR WOULD BE GREAT 
NOW LOVELY HOUSE WHY NOT BUILD A LOFT EXTENSION 
OH YEAH DON'T SAY THAT 
COME ON JENNY LET'S GO WE'VE DONE OUR JOB 
WELL ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT WE'D LIKE TO HAVE A DETACHED HOME ACTUALLY 
SO EVEN IF WE BUILT THE LOFT EXTENSION WE'D STILL BE ATTACHED TO THE NEIGHBOURS RIGHT 
THE REASON BEHIND THAT IS BECAUSE WE OFTEN LIKE TO WATCH MOVIES 
WE PUT IT ON A BIG PROJECTOR PRETEND THIS IS OUR OWN HOME CINEMA 
AND YOU KNOW EVERYBODY SEEMS TO LIKE IT APART FROM THE NEIGHBOURS 
SO NO ONE SEEMS TO LIKE IT REALLY APART FROM YOU TWO 
SUE AND I ENJOY IT THAT'S RIGHT 
YOU'RE A SOCIAL COUPLE NOT JUST WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR HOME CINEMA BUT 
NO LOVE HAVING A BARBECUE INVITING PEOPLE ROUND 
KIERAN'S GOT A FAIRLY LARGE FAMILY AND EVERYBODY POPS ROUND SO IT'S ALL GREAT 
BUT TALKING ABOUT STYLE OF PROPERTY FIRST OF ALL AND AGE OF PROPERTY 
WHAT WOULD YOU IDEALLY LOVE TO HAVE 
YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL US OR ARE YOU HORMONAL YOU DON'T KNOW AND IT CHANGES EVERY DAY 
I WANT TO LIVE IN A LIGHTHOUSE 
NO PROBLEM NOTTINGHAM HAS LOTS OF THOSE 
THEY ARE THE WORDS OF A PREGNANT WOMAN CAN I SAY 
HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING FOR A WHILE YES 
SO YOU'RE AT THAT STAGE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COMPROMISE 
SO IS IT FAIR TO SAY IF WE GOT YOU FOUR BEDROOMS AND DETACHED BIT OF OUTSIDE SPACE 
IN REASONABLY GOOD AREAS YOU'D BE WILLING TO LOOK AT ANYTHING YES 
WE ARE NOW AT THAT POINT AT THAT STAGE YEAH 
AND YOU'VE SOLD YOUR PROPERTY 
WE HAVE SO THE PRESSURE'S ON 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO STAY HERE 
DID YOU JUST PUT WORDS IN THEIR MOUTHS TO MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER MOI 
HERE HOW'S THE OLD PING PONG TABLE LEAGUE GOING ON THEN 
I HEAR YOU PLAY A BIT OF TABLE TENNIS 
WE DO YEAH I'VE GOT A TEAM OF 
HIGHLY TRAINED PROFESSIONALS THAT'S RIGHT 
HE'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTOM LEAGUE 
BOTTOM OF THE BOTTOM LEAGUE 
SUSANNA WHY THE LAUGHING WHEN THE WORD PING PONG WAS MENTIONED DO YOU SUPPORT HIM 
PING PONG PING PONG 
IT IS TABLE TENNIS BUT PING PONG'S FUNNY 
SHALL WE MOVE ON HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GOT TO SPEND 
WE'RE IN THE REGION OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

AND WHAT AREN'T THERE IN WEST BRIDGFORD 
I'LL TELL YOU STREETS 
THE VICTORIAN TOWN PLANNERS DECIDED THAT STREET SOUNDED FAR TOO URBAN

OH HERE WE ARE THEY'VE GOT SOME CHIMES 
CHIMES CHIMES IT'S GOOD KARMA FOR THIS HOUSE 
OH IT'S QUITE BIG UP HERE 
IT'S A BIG SPACE 
THEY WENT STRAIGHT UPSTAIRS RATHER THAN LOOK DOWNSTAIRS FIRST 
SO THEIR HEADS ARE IN THE CLOUDS 
I'D SAY THIS IS BEDROOM THREE RIGHT O. K. 
I WOULD GUESS THAT IT'S A GOOD SIZE 
I DON'T LIKE ANY OF THE DECOR THOUGH THE CEILING 
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE PAINTED NO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE 
COMPLETELY PLASTERED WOULDN'T IT 
OH DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS NEEDS A FEW TOUCHES A FEW TWEAKS 
HE DOESN'T LIKE THE CEILINGS ARTEX 
RIGHT IN HERE I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE SMALLEST ROOM SO THIS COULD BE YOUR STUDY 
YEAH I COULD GET A DESK IN HERE DEFINITELY 
AND SOME NICE PICTURES THIS HOUSE IS CALLING OUT FOR THOSE ISN'T IT 
MY DAD COULD PUT SOME UP YEAH 
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE AREN'T A LOT OF PHOTOS OR PAINTINGS ON THE WALL 
NO BUT SUSANNA'S FATHER IS A PAINTER HE IS 
AND HE'S GOT SOME GREAT PAINTINGS THAT WE COULD PUT UP ON THIS HOUSE 
DOES HE DO GLOSS OR EMULSION 
OH THE GARDEN LOOKS VERY ENGLISH VERY PRETTY VERY ENGLISH 
WHAT DOES SHE EXPECT AN ITALIAN ONE WE'RE IN WEST BRIDGFORD 
RIGHT LITTLE BIT SMALL IN HERE IT'S NOT QUITE AS BIG AS OURS IS IT 
NO BUT AGAIN A BLANK CANVAS WE COULD DO WHAT WE WANTED COULDN'T WE 
THE BATHROOM'S A LET DOWN FOR ME 
YEAH BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BATHROOMS THERE IS A BIT OF A BATHROOM SURPRISE 
LATER ON IN THE HOUSE AH WHICH MAY BE SLIGHTLY UNEXPECTED 
JENNY'S DONE WELL HERE OUR OWN INDOOR GYMNASIUM LOOK 
COS YOU'RE A REGULAR GYM MEMBER 
THAT'S RIGHT GOT NO PROBLEM WITH THE NEIGHBOURS WITH NOISE ANYWAY HAVE THEY 
OOPS 
YOU'VE GOT THEM A DETACHED HOUSE AND A GYMNASIUM 
I HAVE AND A DRUM KIT IN WHICH MEANS OF COURSE SOMEBODY 
IS PLAYING THE DRUMS AND NOBODY'S COMPLAINING 
THEY LOOK INTERESTING STORAGE SPACE EXCELLENT 
GOOD STUFF BUT MIRRORED WOULD YOU LIKE THAT 
YEAH GOOD STUFF O. K. BUT AGAIN IT NEEDS COMPLETELY REDECORATING DOESN'T IT 
NEEDS A BIT OF ENERGY 
FINE THOUGH NOTHING STRUCTURAL 
SO NOT TOO MUCH WORK FOR KIERAN COS I DON'T THINK HE'S THAT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT 
AH THE MAIN ROOM OOH YES THIS IS A GOOD SIZE ISN'T IT 
YEAH BUT LOOK AT THE COLOUR IT'S AWFUL 
WELL IT'S CRYING OUT FOR A NICE PAINT ISN'T IT 
YEAH AND OUR LAMP FROM OUR BEDROOM WOULD LOOK GREAT IN HERE 
OH IT'S AN EN SUITE 
OH YOU SEE SHE WAS SURPRISED 
OH IT'S AN EN SUITE SHE SAID 
YEAH THERE YOU GO 
O. K. NOW LOOK THAT WAS A SURPRISE ANYWAY 
NICE AND COOL AS WELL ISN'T IT I QUITE LIKE IT UP HERE 
WELL IT'S A GOOD SIZE BUT I DO FEEL 
NOT VERY MUCH 
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING WITH IT 
IT'S A BIT GENERIC AS I SAID EARLIER YEP 
D'YOU KNOW IT 
BLAND 
NOW WILL OUR SOFA FIT IN HERE WE'VE GOT A LARGE SOFA 
HAVEN'T WE I THINK THE BIG ONE WOULD FIT ON THE SIDE THERE 
BUT THE ONLY OTHER CHOICE IS PUT THE TWO SEATER WHICH IS A BIT LARGER ON THIS SIDE 
WHEN YOU'RE HOUSE HUNTING YOU'RE SPENDING ALL THAT MONEY 
IF YOUR SOFA DOESN'T FIT DON'T YOU JUST BUY ANOTHER ONE 
WHERE WOULD WE PUT THE PROJECTOR UP SUE 
MAYBE THAT WALL KIERAN'S LOOKING AT IMPORTANT THINGS NOW WHERE TO PUT THE PROJECTOR 
TAKE OUT ALL OF THIS WE COULD PUT IN A BIG DINING TABLE 
INCREASE THE SPACE YEAH EASILY FIT SIX OR EIGHT PEOPLE INTO HERE 
AND AGAIN SOME NICE LIGHTING 
SOMETHING THAT MAKES IT A BIT FRIENDLIER 
YEAH OH THIS WILL BE NICE THIS MUST GET BOILING 
I LIKE HOW IT'S OPENED UP HERE ANYWAY YEAH 
THE HOUSE KIND OF FLOWS DOESN'T IT 
YEAH THERE'S A NICE OPEN SPACE DOWNSTAIRS 
IT'S A RATHER TASTEFUL LITTLE CONSERVATORY SO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR BARBECUES 
AND IT STARTS TO RAIN WHICH IT INEVITABLY DOES IN THIS COUNTRY 
YOU CAN ALL SCUTTLE INTO THE CONSERVATORY 
OOH YOU COULD LIVE WITH THIS 
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE IT IMMEDIATELY 
IT'S A NICE LIGHT KITCHEN DEFINITELY 
LOVELY IS THERE A BREAKFAST TABLE NO 
OH BREAKFAST BAR THEY NEVER MENTIONED THAT 
NO THEY DIDN'T I HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM ONE NO 
OH THIS IS GOOD THEN ISN'T IT 
SO YOU CAN USE THIS SINK ONLY 
RIGHT I SEE O. K. AFTER GARDENING AND DOING ALL YOUR BITS 
MAN STUFF WHAT'S THROUGH THERE 
IT'S A SECRET ROOM 
OH A SECRET ROOM I'D CALL IT A UTILITY ROOM 
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW THEY'VE STILL GOT ROMANCE IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP SO IT'S A SECRET ROOM 
IT'S GOT TO BE A DOWNSTAIRS LOO YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS 
BRILLIANT THERE'S THE TOILET AND THE SINK SO 
SO THAT WILL BE FUN FOR YOU POTTY TRAINING THE KIDS 
THIS IS THE ONLY ROOM IN THE HOUSE THAT DOESN'T NEED ANYTHING DOING TO IT THOUGH SUSANNA 
JENNY I'M AFRAID TO SAY YOU MIGHT BE THE LEADING LADY 
BUT I DON'T THINK THIS ONE IS GONNA DO VERY WELL IN THE BOX OFFICE 
AH HERE THEY ARE HI 
HI THEY'RE SMILING NOW BUT WERE THEY SMILING INSIDE 
YEAH BECAUSE OF COURSE WE CAN'T SEE YOU 
ALL I DO KNOW IS THAT YOU WERE HAPPY WITH CERTAIN THINGS 
IN THE PROPERTY I THINK THE BEDROOMS IT WAS DETACHED OF COURSE BUT 
DID TICK A LOT OF BOXES 
EM BUT NEEDS A LOT OF DECORATING 
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ONE ROOM THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANNA PUT YOUR OWN PERSONALITY INTO IT 
A BLANK CANVAS THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR 
WHAT IS GOOD IS THAT IT'S A NEWER BUILD AND LOOKING AROUND THIS GARDEN HERE IT'S QUITE PRIVATE 
YOU'RE NOT AS OVERLOOKED BY AS MANY HOUSES AS YOU COULD BE ON SOME OF THESE NEWER ESTATES 
EXACTLY BECAUSE A LOT OF ESTATES YOU HAVE A DETACHED PROPERTY 
BUT YOU GET THERE AND THERE'S A GAP THIS BIG IN BETWEEN EACH ONE RIGHT 
YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE SEMI DETACHED OR TERRACED EXACTLY YES 
GUESS THE PRICE TIME YEAH 
KIERAN BEFORE WE START IT IS COMPETITIVE

AND SHE MAY BE HORMONAL 
OOH IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE SO GOOD LUCK O. K. THE BUDGET THE BUDGET 
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

I TELL YOU WHAT 
SHH WHAT FILM'S ABOUT TO START OH 
WELL IT'S A GOOD ENTRANCE 
AMAZING OH LOOK AT THAT BAROMETER 
AMAZING WE HAVEN'T HAD AN AMAZING 
AND WE'VE NEVER HAD AN OH LOOK AT THAT BAROMETER EITHER 
WOW LOOK AT THE FURNITURE SO INTERESTING 
I LOVE THE HIGH CEILING OH MY GOSH THIS IS AMAZING 
GOT A GOOD BAY WINDOW YEAH YEAH WATCH THE WORLD GO BY 
I WANT THEM TO SEE THE REST OF THE HOUSE 
OH LOOK AT THIS LITTLE AREA 
THIS IS GREAT THIS COULD BE A PLAY AREA FOR LILY MAY AND THE NEW BABY 
SHALL WE OPEN THESE DOORS YEAH 
OH THAT'S GREAT 
SO A LOVELY FRONT ROOM THOSE DOORS MEAN YOU CAN HAVE SOME PRIVACY 
OR OPEN IT UP WHEN YOUR FRIENDS COME ROUND 
WELL THE KITCHEN'S A GREAT SIZE I LOVE IT BUT IT'S ALSO DOUBLING UP 
AS A UTILITY AREA ISN'T IT SO WE HAVE TO CONSIDER SPACE 
TAKE THIS OUT THERE'S A DOUBLE FRIDGE FREEZER HERE 
YEAH WHICH WE NEED LOOK AT THE RANGEMASTER WOW 
I WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE ONE OF THESE THINGS 
OH THERE'S A GRILL I CAN DO BACON 
IT'S A BIG BEAUTY OF AN OVEN 
EVEN THOUGH YOU JUST DO BACON 
OH IT'S SO QUAINT QUITE HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY 
THERE'S A LITTLE SPACE HERE AND ANOTHER THERE BUT I THINK THIS 
IS WHERE THE SUN IS SO THAT'S WHY THEY'VE GOT THEIR SEATING AREA OUT 
HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY NOT HEARD THAT FOR A WHILE HAVE WE 
IF YOU WERE EATING THERE THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE WOULD SPILL OUT WHEN YOU WERE HAVING A BARBECUE 
IS THERE ROOM FOR YOUR BARBECUE 
WHERE WOULD IT GO HERE YEAH YOU'D LIKELY PUT THE BARBECUE THERE 
AND AGAIN IT'S NOT OVERLOOKED BY OTHER HOUSES IT'S JUST ONE BUILDING ON THE SIDE YEAH 
THAT LITTLE SPACE THERE THEY'RE RIGHT NOT OVERLOOKED VERY PRIVATE BARBECUE 
JUST FOR WHEN YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF REAL CLOSE FRIENDS ROUND COUPLE OF GLASSES OF WINE 
RIGHT THEN OH SHALL WE GO IN THE BATHROOM I THINK IT'S THIS ONE 
OH LOOK AT THE DOOR ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL OH THAT IS LOVELY 
THE SUITE'S GORGEOUS THIS IS THE BEST BATHROOM WE'VE SEEN SO FAR 
NO DOUBT IT DOESN'T TOUCH ANY OF THE OTHERS 
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE MAIN BEDROOM IT'S A GOOD SIZE BUT WE WOULD NEED WARDROBES AND STORAGE WOULDN'T WE 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT IT LACKS YEAH 
IT'S GOT THE SHELVES THERE 
SO THAT'S A KING SIZE BED I SUPPOSE YEAH WHICH WE'VE GOT WOULD FIT IN HERE 
BUT THEN YOU'D NEED EXTRA WARDROBES WHICH USE SPACE 
YEAH WE NEED MORE STORAGE UPSTAIRS 
STORAGE WISE I THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM IN THIS PLACE 
PLENTY JUST NEEDS A BIT OF RECONFIGURATION 
THIS MAIN BEDROOM IS A GOOD SIZE YEAH 
WELL MAYBE THIS IS THE MAIN BEDROOM OH THIS HAS LOADS OF STORAGE IN HERE 
SO WITH THAT OUT IT'S ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THAT ONE 
IT'S PROBABLY A BIT BIGGER SUE AND REMEMBERING THAT THE GARAGE IS ON THAT SIDE OF THE WALL 
SO YOU COULD MAKE IT EVEN BIGGER 
WELL THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE SMALLEST BEDROOM YEAH 
SO I'M STRUGGLING NOW TO DECIDE WHICH BEDROOM WOULD 
LILY MAY HAVE COS THIS WOULD BE THE NEW NURSERY 
THIS WOULD BE IDEAL YEAH 
AHH THE FRONT LITTLE BOX ROOM PERFECT NURSERY

I'VE GOT SOME PLANS AS JENNY SAYS I LIKE A SKETCH WHEN IN DOUBT 
MAKE A PLAN THAT'S WHAT WE ALWAYS SAY 
MAKE A PLAN MADE A PLAN THE CURRENT OWNERS HAD SOME PLANS DRAWN UP TO EXTEND THIS PROPERTY 
LOOK AT HIS THEY'VE ACTUALLY EXTENDED IT 
AND DONE A WHOLE THING RIGHT INTO THE GARDEN AND GIVEN THEM MUCH MORE LIVING SPACE 
YEAH I THINK THOUGH TOO MUCH LIVING SPACE OVER DEVELOPED IT 
YOU WANT A GARDEN FOR BARBECUES DON'T YOU YES 
ALL YOU NEED IS AN EXTRA BEDROOM DON'T YOU REALLY 
SO BEST THING IS TO TAKE A LOOK AT NEXT DOOR BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY'VE DONE 
TAKE YOUR GARAGE DOWN BUILD UP TWO STOREYS YOU CAN KEEP YOUR GARAGE 
IT'S A SHAME THEY'VE GOT RID OF THEIR GARAGE THERE 
KEEP YOUR GARAGE UP ABOVE IT YOU'LL LOSE A BIT ON YOUR EXISTING BEDROOM AT THE BACK 
FOR A HALLWAY BUT TWO EXTRA BEDROOMS
