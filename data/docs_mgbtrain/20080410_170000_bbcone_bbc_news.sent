THE ECONOMY THEY'VE BROUGHT THEY'RE BROUGHT 
DOWN TO FIVE PER CENT BUT SOME FIXED RATE 
MORTGAGES ACTUALLY GO UP 
ALSO ON THE PROGRAMME 
FOR ALL THE NON BELIEVERS THE NON 
MUSLIMS LET IT BE KNOWN THAT YOU 
CAN NEVER WIN IN THIS WAR 
NEVER CAN YOU WIN IN THIS WAR 
A SO CALLED SUICIDE VIDEO PLAYED IN 
COURT AT THE AIRLINE TERROR TRIAL 
SAUDI ARMS DEAL THE HIGH COURT 
SAYS THE U. K. GOVERNMENT WAS WRONG TO 
DROP A CORRUPTION INQUIRY 
THE SHANNON MATTHEWS CASE THREE 
MORE MEMBERS OF HER EXTENDED FAMILY 
ARE ARRESTED 
AND CALLS TO BAN THE E. NUMBERS IN 
YOUR FAVOURITE FOODS ARE THEY 
MAKING OUR CHILDREN HYPERACTIVE 
ON B. B. C. LONDON THE FIGHT TO STOP 
DOZENS OF RESCUED HORSES BEING 
RETURNED TO THE OWNERS ACCUSED OF 
MISTREATING THEM 
AND THE GREEN PARTY PROMISE TO MAKE 
THE CAPITAL NOT JUST GREENER BUT 
HAPPIER TOO 
GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE SIX O'CLOCK 
NEWS THE BANK OF ENGLAND RESPONDED 
TO THE DEEPENING CREDIT CRISIS 
TODAY BY CUTTING INTEREST RATES BY 
A QUARTER OF ONE PERCENT TO FIVE PER CENT 
IT'S THE THIRD CUT SINCE DECEMBER 
AND IT COMES AMID FEARS ABOUT 
FALLING HOUSE PRICES AND A LACK OF 
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN THE ECONOMY 
MOST OF THE BIG MORTGAGE LENDERS 
SAY THEY'LL PASS THAT CUT ON BUT 
SOME ARE ACTUALLY INCREASING THEIR 
FIXED RATE DEALS HERE IS OUR 
ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT HUGH PYM 
SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME AGO 
INTEREST RATES AT FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT IN THE 
LATTER PART OF LAST YEAR SINCE 
THEN THERE HAVE BEEN THREE CUTS 
WITH THE BANK OF ENGLAND BASE RATE 
FROM TODAY STANDING AT FIVE PER CENT BUT HOW 
MUCH DIFFERENCE WILL THAT MAKE TO 
BORROWERS AND HENCE THE WIDER 
ECONOMY ECONOMY THE B. B. C. NEWS MORTGAGE TRACKER TEAM 
HAS BEEN CONTACTING MANY BANKS AND 
BUILDING SOCIETIES TO FIND OUT HOW 
THEY'RE REACTING THESE ARE OUR 
FINDINGS SO FAR 
OTHERS HAVEN'T YET DECIDED BUT ON 
FIXED RATE DEALS IT'S A DIFFERENT 
STORY STORY NATIONWIDE AND ALLIANCE AND AMP LEICESTER 
ANNOUNCED THEY'RE INCREASING RATES 
ON SOME OF THEIR DEALS 
IT'S A REAL PUZZLE FOR BORROWERS 
LIKE PAUL HIS FIXED RATE MORTGAGE 
IS DUE TO END SOON HE WAS OFFERED 
A MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCT SIGNED UP 
BUT WAS THEN TOLD IT HAD BEEN 
PULLED 
WE PUT AN APPLICATION IN PULLED FOR A PRODUCT ON A FRIDAY AND THIS 
THE SPACE OF A WEEKEND THE 
FINANCIAL ADVISOR RECEIVED THE 
APPLICATION THE PRODUCT WAS 
WITHDRAWN WITHDRAWN SO WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE OF THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH THE GAP BETWEEN BANK 
OF ENGLAND BASE AND 
OTHER INTEREST 
OF ENGLAND BASE AND OTHER INTEREST RATES HAS WIDENED AFTER PEAKING 
LAST SUMMER THE BASE RATE IS BACK 
DOWN TO FIVE PER CENT 
BUT THE KEY RATE FOR BANKS LENDING 
TO EVEN OTHER HAS STAYED HIGH AT 
JUST UNDER SIX BECAUSE THEY'RE 
RELUCTANT TO LEND AND SO HAS THE 
AVERAGE TWO YEAR FIXED RATE 
MORTGAGE SIXTY SIX AT THE END OF 
MARCH 
FOR A LOT OF LENDERS A LARGE 
PROPORTION OF THE MONEY THEY LEND 
OUT ON MORTGAGES IS BORROWED FROM 
THE MONEY MARKETS AND THE MONEY 
MARKETS ARE DRIVEN BY THE PRICE AT 
WHICH BANKS WILL LEND TO EACH 
IT DOESN'T PASS ON THROUGH TO 
CUSTOMERS AT THE END OF THE CHAIN 
IT ISN'T JUST THE HOUSING AND 
MORTGAGE MARKETS WHICH ARE AFFECTED 
BY THE CREDIT CRUNCH AND THE 
RELUCTANCE OF BANKS TO LEN THERE 
IS EVIDENCE TO LEND THERE IS 
EVIDENCE SOME OTHER PARTS OF THE 
ECONOMY ARE FEELING THE PINCH 
CHESTER CITY CENTRE IS ONE EXAMPLE 
A SHOPPING AND LEISURE DEVELOPMENT 
HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD BECAUSE THE 
FINANCIERS HAVE GONE COLD ON THE 
IDEA SOME OF THE SITE'S BEEN 
CLEARED BUT THERE IS NO SIGN YET OF 
OF BUILDERS MOVING IN 
THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT 
PROBLEM THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING 
DEVELOPERS CANNOT BORROW MONEY 
EASILY THEY NEED TO BE HEAVILY 
SECURED THE BANKS ARE VERY KEEN 
NOT TO LEND MONEY 
WHILE SAVERS 
COMPLAIN WHEN INTEREST RATES FALL 
HOME OWNERS USUALLY CELEBRATE BUT 
AS THE CREDIT CRUNCH GRIPS THE 
HOUSING MARKET AND THE WIDER 
ECONOMY IT'S HARD TO PREDICT JUST 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT 
LET'S TALK TO OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR 
TPHRPB FLAN FLAN STEPHANIE 
FLANDERS A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT 
MORTGAGE LENDERS ARE DOING WHETHER 
THEY'RE PASSING THIS CUT ON 
WHETHER MOST MORTGAGE CUSTOMERS 
FEEL THE EFFECT OF THIS IT'S IT'S COMPLICATED BUT THE THING TO 
REMEMBER OBVIOUSLY IS ARE YOU 
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE ON EXISTING 
MORTGAGES OR PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A 
NEW ONE THERE IS TWO BIG DIFFERENT 
STORY THERE IF YOU YOU ON AN 
EXISTING MORTGAGE ABOUT HALF OF 
PEOPLE HAVE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES SO 
BY DEFINITION THEY'RE NOT AFFECTED 
BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY THEY CHOSE 
OTHER PEOPLE NOW WILL SEE FARCE WE 
CAN TELL THEY WILL SEE THE 
BENEFITS OF THIS CUT THE LEADING 
LENDERS HAVE SAID THEY'RE GOING TO 
REDUCE THEIR STANDARD VARIABLE 
RATES THE DIFFICULTY COMES FOR THE 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO REMORTGAGE OR 
FIRST TIME BUYERS THOSE RATES THE 
RATES ON OFFER NOW TO NEW CUSTOMERS 
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO 
GO DOWN AND IF ANYTHING THEY'RE 
GOING UP AS YOU MENTIONED SOME BIG 
LENDERS HAVE ANNOUNCED IN THE LAST 
FEW DAYS THEY'RE GOING TO INCREASE 
RATES 
TALKING ABOUT THREE RATE RATES CUTS SINCE DECEMBER WILL THIS DO 
ANYTHING TO STOP THE SLOWDOWN IN 
THE ECONOMY TO HELP THE ECONOMY 
WELL IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO TAKE 
A STEP BACK WE HAVE HAD DOOM AND 
GLOOM THE LAST FEW DAYS THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND LOOKED AT IT AND SAID IS 
THIS FUNDAMENTALLY A DIFFERENT 
STORY THAN THE ONE WE THOUGHT WAS 
GOING TO HAPPEN A FEW MONTHS AGO 
THEY SAID WE THINK THE ECONOMY 
NEEDS MORE HELP IT'S NOT TIME TO 
PANIC WE HAVE GIVEN THEM THIS CUT 
BUT WE ARE STILL WORRIED ABOUT 
INFLATION SO WE THINK THAT'S 
ENOUGH FOR NOW OBVIOUSLY WE WILL 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS OVER THE NEXT FEW 
MONTHS AND SO WILL THE BANK FOR 
NOW NOW THEY'RE SAYING DON'T PANIC 
YOU JUST NEED MORE HELP 
THE JURY IN THE AIRLINE TERROR 
TRIAL HEARD EXTRACTS TODAY OF A SO 
CALLED SUICIDE VIDEO THE COURT HAS

GANG OF EIGHT BRITISH MEN WHO

PROSECUTION SAY IT WAS DESIGNED TO 
BE RELEASED AFTER HIS DEATH AND 
THAT THAT MAN IS UMAR ISLAM 
MARTYRDOM OPERATIONS UPON MARTYRDOM 
OPERATIONS WILL KEEP ON RAINING ON 
THESE UNTIL THEY RELEASE YOU AND 
LEAVE OUR LANDS 
AN EXTRACT FROM WHAT THE 
PROSECUTION SAY IS A SUICIDE VIDEO 
FOUND IN THIS CAR IN EAST LONDON 
THE TAPE WAS FOUND IN THE BOOT AS 
POLICE ARRESTED EIGHT MEN SUSPECTED 
OF PLANNING TO ATTACK TRANSATLANTIC 
AIRLINERS THE MAN SPEAKING IS UMAR 
ISLAM FROM EAST LONDON HE SAYS HE 
HAS BEEN INSPIRED BY OSAMA BIN 
LADEN 
WE WILL NOT LEAVE THIS PATH LADEN UNTIL YOU LEAVE OUR LANDS AND UNTIL 
YOU FEEL WHAT WE ARE FEELING THIS 
IS REVENGE FOR THE ACTIONS OF THE 
U. S. A. IN THE MUSLIM LANDS AND THEIR 
ACCOMPLICES SUCH AS THE BRITISH 
AND THE JEWS THIS IS A WARNING TO 
THE NON BELIEVERS THAT IF THEY DO 
NOT LEAVE OUR LANDS THERE ARE MANY 
MORE LIKE US AND MANY MORE LIKE ME 
READY TO STRIKE UNTIL THE LAW OF 
ALLAH IS ESTABLISHED ON THIS EARTH 
TO ALL THE NON BELIEVERS THE NON 
MUSLIMS LET IT BE KNOWN THAT YOU

THEY ARE ACCUSED OF 
PLOTTING TO SMUGGLE LIQUID 
EXPLOSIVES IN SOFT DRINKS BOTTLES 
ON TO SEVEN OR MORE PLANES LEAVING 
ON THE SAME AFTERNOON FROM HEATHROW 
AND TO DESTROY THEM ALL IN MID AIR 
WHEN THE MEN WERE ARRESTED THERE 
WAS CHAOS AT AIRPORTS WORLDWIDE AS 
LIQUIDS WERE BANNED FROM HAND 
LUGGAGE THIS IS THE EAST EAST 
LONDON HOUSE WHERE THE PROSECUTION 
SAY THE MEN FILMED THEIR SUICIDE 
VIDEOS HERE THE PROSECUTION SAY 
THE MEN HAD ESTABLISHED WHAT WAS IN 
EFFECT A BOMB FACTORY UPSTAIRS 
THANKS TO AN M. I FIVE BUG THE MEN ARE 
SEEN ON CAMERA APPARENTLY 
EXPERIMENTING WITH THEIR PROPOSED 
DEVICES OFF CAMERA THEY'RE HEARD 
RECORDING THEY'RE SO CALLED 
MARTYRDOM VIDEOS SEARCHES AT THIS 
HOUSE IN HIGH WYCOMBE THREW UP A 
FURTHER TAPE WHICH THE PROSECUTION 
SAY CONTAINED FIVE MORE VIDEOS IN 
ALL SIX MEN HAD RECORDED STATEMENTS 
ALLEGEDLY DESIGNED TO BE RELEASED 
AFTER THEIR DEATHS 
IN HIS VIDEO UMAR ISLAM IS ASKED IF 
HE HAS BEEN BRAINWASHED AND HE 
REPLAYS I WOULD REPLIES YES BY 
THE CLEAN AND CLEANSING WATERS OF 
ISLAM ALL EIGHT DEFENDANTS DENY 
CHARGES OF CONSPIRACY TO MURDER 
AND ENDANGER AN AIRCRAFT 
A DECISION BY THE SERIOUS FRAUD 
OFFICE TO DROP AN INVESTIGATION 
INTO ALLEGED CORRUPTION IN ARMS 
DEALS BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND B. A. E. 
SYSTEMS WAS ILLEGAL THAT WAS THE 
RULING TODAY FROM THE HIGH COURT 
TWO SENIOR JUDGES CONTEPLED WHAT 
THEY CALLED THE GOVERNMENT'S ABJECT 
SURRENDER TO THREATS FROM SAUDI 
ARABIA TO END CO OPERATION OVER 
TERRORISM UNLESS THE INQUIRY WAS 
STOPPED HERE IS OUR SECURITY 
CORRESPONDENT FRANK GARDNER 
IT WAS BRITAIN'S BIGGEST EXPORT 
DEAL IN HISTORY KNOWN AS AL 
YAMAMAH BILLIONS OF POUNDS WORTH 
OF TORNADO JETS TRAINERS AND OTHER 
EQUIPMENT SOLD TO SAUDI ARABIA FROM 
THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES ONWARDS BUT NOW THE HIGH 
COURT HAS RULED THE GOVERNMENT 
SHOULD NOT HAVE STOPPED A PROBE 
INTO WHETHER OR NOT AL YAMAMAH WAS 
SECURED THANKS TO BRIBERY THE 
ALLEGATIONS ARE THAT BACK IN THE 
EIGHTIES MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF BRIBES 
WERE PAID BY THE MANUFACTURER B. A. E. 
INTO THE PRIVATE POCKETS OF A KEY 
SAUDI PRINCE NOT SEEN HERE BOTH 
HE AND B. A. E. SYSTEMS DENY ANY 
WRONGDOING BUT THE SERIOUS FRAUD 
OFFICE THE S. F. O. HAS SUSPICIOUS 
ENOUGH TO LAUNCH A CRIMINAL PROBE 
IT WAS HOMING IN ON SWISS BANK 
ACCOUNTS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN THE THEN 
PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR ORDERED 
THE PROBE STOPPED QUOTING SAUDI 
THREATS THE SAUDI THREATS WERE 
DELIVERED IN PRIVATE TO DOWNING 
STREET BUT THEY WERE EXPLICIT 
STOP THE PROBE OR TRADE WILL SUFFER 
AND WE WILL STOP CO OPERATING ON 
COUNTERTERRORISM COUNTERTERRORISM THE IMPLICATION WAS BRITAIN COULD 
BE AT RISK OF ANOTHER SEVEN SEVENTHS ATTACK 
TODAY THE HIGH COURT JUDGES SAID 
LAST YEAR AT THE G. EIGHT SUMMIT TONY 
BLAIR DEFENDED HIS DECISION TO STOP 
THAT S. F. O. PROBE 
I DON'T BELIEVE THE 
INVESTIGATION WILL HAVE LED ANY 
WHERE EXCEPT TO THE COMPLETE 
WRECKAGE OF A VITAL STRATEGIC 
RELATIONSHIP FOR OUR COUNTRY IN 
TERMS OF FIGHTING TERRORISM IN 
TERMS OF THE MIDDLE EAST IN TERMS 
OF BRITISH INTERESTS THERE 
SO WHAT 
HAPPENS NEXT WELL THE LATEST ARMS 
DEAL TO SELL JETS TO SAUDI IS 
ALREADY SIGNED AND SEALED BUT THE 
SAUDIS WILL NOW BE WATCHING TO SEE 
IF THE S. F. O. REOPENS ITS PROBE 
MEANWHILE THE GOVERNMENT HERE IS 
FACING SOME DAMMING REACTIONS WELL WELL IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS COURT RULING 
THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE MADE TO LOOK 
LIKE A BANANA REPUBLIC IN WHICH A 
GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN 
HAPPY TO SUSPEND THE RULE OF LAW IN 
THE MIDDLE OF ALLEGATIONS OF 
SERIOUS MISCONDUCT BRIBERY 
CORRUPTION AND UNDETAILED UNSPOKEN 
THREATS FROM ANOTHER GOVERNMENT 
WHATEVER THE FUTURE OF ANGLO SAUDI 
ARMS DEAL TODAY'S RULING SENDS OUT 
A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT BRITISH 
JUSTICE MUST REMAIN IMMUNE FROM 
FOREIGN INTERVENTION 
THE FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY HAS URGED 
MANUFACTURERS TO REMOVE SIX 
ARTIFICIAL COLOURINGS FROM THEIR 
PRODUCTS IT WANTS THE E. NUMBERS 
REMOVED BECAUSE OF GROWING EVIDENCE 
THAT THEY MAY CAUSE HYPERACTIVITY 
IN CHILDREN CHILDREN'S CAKE SOFT 
DRINKS SOME OF THE PRODUCTS WHICH 
HAVE ARTIFICIAL COLOURINGS TO SPICE 
UP THEIR LOOK BUT THE FOOD 
WATCHDOG THE F. S. A. NOW WANTS THESE 
KINDS OF COLOURINGS BANNED THAT'S 
BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL RISK TO 
CHILDREN THE WATCHDOG SAYS 
COLOURINGS HAVE NO NUTRITIONAL 
VALUE BUT THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT 
THE IMPACT ON THEIR MENTAL STATE 
THE CONCERN CENTRES ON CHILDREN'S 
BEHAVIOUR NOW THERE ARE NO 
PROBLEMS HERE TODAY JUST A BIT OF 
EXCITEMENT BUT SOME RESEARCH SHOWS 
THAT MIXTURE OF ADDITIVES WHEN 
EATEN CAN PROVOKE HYPERACTIVITY AND 
ALSO TEMPER TANTRUMS 
THESE ARE THE SIX ADDITIVES IN 
QUESTION RED AND YELLOW ARTIFICIAL 
COLOURINGS THE FOOD STANDARDS 
AGENCY WANTS THEM BANNED BY EUROPE 
AND UNTIL THEN FOR MANUFACTURERS TO 
REMOVE THEM VOLUNTARILY THE THE INDUSTRY HAVE DONE A LOT ALREADY 
AND WHAT WE ARE HOPING THIS 
DECISION WILL DO IS SPEED THE 
INDUSTRY UP IN TAKING THESE 
ARTIFICIAL COLOURS OUT OF FOOD AND 
DRINK 
BUT THE INDUSTRY SAYS IT'S DRINK ALREADY DONE WHAT IT CAN TO REFORM 
LATE CHILDREN'S FOOD AND IT'S 
SURPRISED BY THE WATCHDOG'S 
DECISION 
IT SEEMS TO US COMPLETELY DECISION DISPROPORTIONATE THAT WE SHOULD 
INTRODUCE MEASURES THAT ARE GOING 
TO TAKE OFF SUPERMARKET SHELVES 
PRODUCTS THAT ARE POPULAR WITH 
ADULTS WHETHER THAT BE MUSHY PEAS 
BATTENBERG CAKE OR TRADITIONAL LIME 
CORDIALS IT DOES SEEM TO US TO BE 
DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE PROBLEM 
PARENTS HOWEVER SAY THEY HAVE TO 
MAKE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO AVOID 
ADDITIVES HOW MUCH ATTENTION DO 
YOU PAY TO FOOD ADDITIVES 
TRY TO 
AVOID THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AS 
CHILDREN SEEM TO BE MORE SENSITIVE 
TO THEM NOW TRY TO KEEP EVERYTHING 
AS FRESH AND ORGANIC AS POSSIBLE I I TRY TO GIVE THEM A BALANCED DIET 
MOST OF THE TIME IF THEY HAVE A 
LITTLE BIT OF JUNK FOOD IN BETWEEN 
YOU KNOW OH WELL THAT'S LIFE I I LOVE THEM AND I DON'T TRY AND AVOID 
THEM THEY'RE JUST YUMMY DESPITE DESPITE MANY CHILDREN'S DEVOTION TO THESE 
PRODUCTS PRESSURE IS BUILDING TO 
REMOVE THEM CONSUMER AND PARENT 
GROUPS ACROSS EUROPE ARE NOW URGING 
THE E. U. FOR A COMPLETE BAN 
PRESIDENT BUSH HAS SAID HE'LL PUT A 
FREEZE ON THE WITHDRAWAL OF U. S. 
TROOPS FROM IRAQ HE SAID A LIMITED

KATE AND GERRY MCCANN ARE CALLING 
FOR A EUROPE WIDE CHILD ALERT 
SYSTEM TO HELP TRACE ABDUCTED 
CHILDREN THE MCCANNS WHOSE 
DAUGHTER MADELEINE HAS BEEN MISSING 
FOR NEARLY A YEAR WERE IN BRUSSELS 
TO URGE MEPS TO BACK THAT SCHEME 
FROM THERE OUR SPECIAL 
CORRESPONDENT REPORTS 
IT IS NEARLY YEAR A YEAR SINCE 
MADELEINE MCCANN DISAPPEARED SINCE 
EUROPE WAS ASKED TO LOOK FOR 
LITTLE GIRL 
HER PARENTS KEEP THE CAMPAIGN GOING 
AND TODAY IT BROUGHT THEM TO THE 
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT 
THEY WERE HERE FOR THIS TO 
ENCOURAGE MEPS TO ADOPT AN 
AMERICAN STYLE ALERT SYSTEM TO BE 
USED WHEN A CHILD DISAPPEARS 
I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE OF THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES WITH REGARD TO 
MADELEINE'S ABDUCTION 
MADELEINE WAS AN INCREDIBLY HAPPY 
CONFIDENT AND VERY LOVED LITTLE 
GIRL GIRL AND THIS TIME LAST YEAR WE WERE A 
VERY HAPPY FAMILY AND WE FELT VERY 
LUCKY 
THE KEY POINT IS WE WANT LUCKY INFORMATION KEY INFORMATION TO 
BE DISSEMINATED TO THE PUBLIC TO 
GALVANISE THEIR RESPONSE AND HELP 
LEAD TO THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME AND 
RECOVERY OF THE CHILD 
SO THEY WERE 
HERE FOR POLICY 
MCCANNS IT'S DIFFERENT THEY ARE 
STILL SUSPECTS IN THEIR DAUGHTER'S 
DISAPPEARANCE JOURNALISTS AND 
CAMERA CREWS FOLLOW THEM WHEREVER 
THEY GO THEY SAY THEY WANTED TO 
EXPLAIN WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH 
YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE 
TO KNOW JUST EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE 
GONE THROUGH WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE 
WHAT MADELEINE'S GONE THROUGH I I THINK IT IS AN ISSUE THAT UNLESS 
YOU'VE BEEN EXPERIENCED IT IT'S 
JUST UNBELIEVABLE AND IT DRIVES US 
IN TERMS OF TRYING TO AFFECT CHANGE 
IT'S STILL RAW NOT AS RAW AS IT 
WAS LAST YEAR BUT IT'S LIKE 
SOMETHING OUT OF HORROR THE THE MCCANNS SPENT THE AFTERNOON IN HERE 
LOBBYING FOR CHANGE THEY BELIEVE 
THAT AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM COULD 
HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE ON THE NIGHT 
MADELEINE DISAPPEARED SO THE 
CAMPAIGN GOES ON THE INVESTIGATION 
GOES ON BUT NEARLY ONE YEAR ON IN 
REALITY WE ARE NO NEARER KNOWING 
WHAT HAPPENED TO MADELEINE MCCANN 
NOW IT ALL STARTED AS A BIT OF A 
JOKE ON THE INTERNET BUT IT'S NOW 
BECOME A GLOBAL PHENOMENON RICK 
ROLLING IS A CRAZE IN WHICH PEOPLE 
ARE UNEXPECTEDLY CONFRONTED WITH 
THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HIT SONG NEVER GONNA GIVE

A LIFE OF ITS OWN ON 
OF COURSE THERE'S BEEN MANY 
INTERNET PRANKS BEFORE LONELY GIRL 
FIFTEEN GRIPPED MANY WITH HER BLOG BUT 
REVEALED TO BE AN AND THEN 
THERE'S THIS IT'S A VIDEO TRICK 
AND ALSO A SUBTLE ADVERT 
INDEED THERE'S NOW AN INDUSTRY 
CREATING THESE VIRAL VIDEOS THAT 
ARE REALLY ADS 
IT TURNS OUT TO 
HAVE BEEN A RAY BAN PRODUCTION BUT 
THE BRANDING IS SO SUBTLE THAT THAT 
WASN'T OBVIOUS AT ALL WHEN IT WAS 
FIRST DOING THE ROUND AND THAT'S A 
VERY POWERFUL TOOL THESE DAYS IT 
IS VERY EFFECTIVE AND A LOT 
CLEVERER THAN JUST BUY OUR 
PRODUCT 
RICK ROLLING THOUGH IS PRODUCT JUST A DRAFT CRAZE
