GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO 
TUESDAY'S WORKING LUNCH L. AM ADAM 
ARE SMALL BUSINESSES GETTING 
A SECOND CLASS SERVICE FROM THE 
ROYAL MAIL AN IND INREVIEW SAYS 
BIG BUSINESS IS BENEFITING FROM 
INCREASED COMPETITION BUT DOING 
NOTHING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND 
CONSUMERS OIL PRICES HIT A RECORD 
HIGH AND TULLOW OIL STRIKE IT LUKEY 
WITH AN OIL FIND THAT SHARES ITS 
SHARES SKY HIGH THE WORKING LUNCH 
VIEWER WHO HAD TO PAY TWO DIFFERENT 
ESTATE AGENTS WHEN SHE SOLD HER 
HOUSE OUR CHILD TRUST FUNDS 
FINALLY GROWING UP MORE PEOPLE ARE 
INVESTING THEIR FIFTY VOUCHERS BUT 
WILL PARENTS PUT LESS OF THEIR OWN 
MONEY IN THE ACCOUNTS AND I AM 
FINDING OUT WHY THE LAST 
TRADITIONAL OAT CAKE SHOP IS UNDER 
THREAT IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE THEY 
ARE LETTING ME HAVE A GO AT MAKING 
THEM OPENING UP THE POSTAL SYSTEM 
TO GREATER COMPETITION HAS BEEN 
GOOD FOR BIG BUSINESS BUT HAS DONE 
NOTHING FOR HOUSEHOLDS OR SMALL 
THOSE ARE THE FINDINGS 
BUSINESSES THOSE ARE THE FINDINGS OF AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE 
POSTAL SERVICE SECTOR RACHEL HAS 
BEEN LOOKING AT THE DETAIL OF THE 
REPORT THE ROYAL MAIL HAVE BEEN 
DELIVERING OUR LETTERS AND PARCELS 
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS BUT SINCE 
LIBERALISATION AT THE START OF TWO THOUSAND SIX 
NINETEEN OTHER OPERATORS HAVE BEEN GIVEN 
THE RIGHT TO COLLECT AND DELIVER 
MAIL IN THE U. K. THE INDUSTRY 
REGULATOR POSTCOMM HAS HOPED THIS 
WOULD PROMOTE EFFECTIVE COMPETITION 
ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED 
FOR LARGE BUSINESSS WHO HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO NEGOTIATE CONTRACT DRIVING 
DOWN PRICES TODAY'S REPORT SAYS 
SMALLER BUSINESSES AND HOUSEHOLDS 
HAVEN'T FELT THE BENEFIT WITHOUT 
THE VOLUME TO NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS 
WITH THE NEW PROVIDER MORE THAN 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STILL 
DEPENDENT ON THE ROYAL MAIL 
SPECIALLY FOR THEIR FINANCIAL 
TRANSACTION WITH THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
SQUEEZING THEY SAY THEY NEED LATER 
COLLECTIONS TO ENSURE ENVOICE ARE 
SENT AND BILLS PAID ON TIME THEY 
ALSO SAY THAT CENT CHARGE CHANGES 
BASED ON WEIGHT AND SIZE HAS LED TO 
A MORE COMPLICATED SYSTEM THAT HAS 
SPECIALLY AFFECTED BUSINESSES IN 
RURAL AREAS WHERE THEY CAN'T EASILY 
GET TO A POST OFFICE BUT ACCORDING 
TO TODAY'S REPORT EIGHTY THREE PER CENT OF SMALL 
BUSINESSES BELIEVE THAT FIRST CLASS 
POST DOES OFFER GOOD VALUE FOR 
MONEY WHAT ABOUT CONSUMERS THE 
AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD SPENDS FIFTY PENCE A 
WEEK ON MAIL AND THE REPORT SUGGEST 
OUR OPINION OF THE POSTAL SERIES IS 
DESCRIBED AS SATISFIED INDIFFERENCE 
IN TWO THOUSAND THREE ROYAL MAIL AIM TO COMPLETE 
THEIR FIRST DELIVERY BY NINE HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE 
MORNLE TODAY IT IS TWO P. M. AND THREE P. M. FOR 
SOME RURAL AREAS THE NUMBER OF 
DAILY DELIVERIES WAS CUT FROM TWO TO ONE 
AND LAST YEAR SUNDAY COLLECTIONS 
STOPPED THESE CHANGES ALONG 
WITH INCREASES IN THE COST OF 
STAMPS AS PROMPTED VIEWERS TO GET 
IN TOUCH KEITH E. MAILED TO SAY HE 
RECEIVED A PARCEL ADDRESSED TO 
SOMEONE ELSE AS A DIFFERENT ADDRESS 
HE SAYS IF I HAD THIS SERVICE FROM 
ANY OTHER BUSINESS I WOULD NO 
LONGER USE THEM BUT WHO ELSE CAN WE 
USE TO SEND LETTERS DAVID SAYS 
BUT ERIC SAYS HE POSTED A LETTER 
FIRST CLAIS ON MONDAY AND RECEIVED 
THE REPLY BY WEDNESDAY MORNING HE 
THINKS IT IS AN EXCELLENT SERVICE 
AND SHOULD BE APPLAUDED WHEN IT 
COMES TO LARGE BUSINESSES JUST FIFTY 
COMPANIES ACCOUNT FOR FORTY PER CENT OF THE 
MAIL MARKET TODAY'S REPORT SAYS 
THESE BIG PLAYERS NOW HAVE A 
GREATER CHOICE OF SERVICE AND ARE 
IN A STRONGER POSITION TO NEGOTIATE 
IN A STRONGER POSITION TO NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS ROYAL MAIL DELIVERS TO 
MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT MILLION ADDRESSES 
ACROSS THE U. K. ONE OF THE 
MOTIVATIONS BEHIND THIS REVIEW WAS 
TO LOOK AT HOW THAT CRUCIAL 
UNIVERSAL SERVICE CAN BE SUSTAINED 
BECAUSE THE REVIEW WARNS THAT 
RAPIDLY GROWING COMPETITION AND A 
DECLINE IN THE LETTER MARKET HAS 
PUT ROYAL MAIL'S FINANCIAL 
STABILITY UNDER THREAT AND SAYS 
SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE HOWARD 
WEBBERS FROM POSTWATCH JOIN US NOW 
MOST INDIVIDUALS HAVEN'T BENEFITED 
SO IT IS NOT VERY GOOD IS THAT 
YOUR VIEW 
COMPETITION DIRECTLY HAS 
BENEFITED THE LARGE MAILER THAT IS 
THE CASE BUT WE HAVE BENEFITED 
INDIRECTLY PARTLY THROUGH THE 
INCREASE IN EFFICIENCY THAT ROYAL 
MAIL HAVE SHOWN BECAUSE COMPETITION 
HAS MADE THEM UP THEIR GAME A LOT 
AND IN THE LONGER TERM THERE IS NO 
REASON WHY THE EFFECTS SHOULDN'T 
DIRECTLY HIT SMALLER BUSINESSES AND 
DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS 
WHAT DO YOU 
MEAN BY THAT THE LONG TERM HOW AS 
A POSTAL USER SEE ANY BENEFIT 
THERE COULD BE COMPETITION IN AREAS 
WHICH CURRENTLY WE DON'T SEE MUCH 
COMPETITION IN THE SMALL BUSINESS 
USE AND DOMESTIC USE THERE IS NO 
LAW AGAINST IT THERE IS NO REASON 
WHY THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN WE ARE 
RESIP YENS OF MAIL THE STATISTICS 
ARE ABOUT THE FACT THAT BIG USERS 
ACCOUNT FOR LARGER PART OF THE MAIL 
INDUSTRY BUT AS RESIP YENS WE ALL 
BENEFIT WE ARE PART OF THE MAIL 
INDUSTRY 
YES MANY PEOPLE MIGHT INDUSTRY SAY THEY WOULD RATHER IT WEREN'T SO 
EFFICIENT IN DELIVERING SOME OF THE 
RUBBISH ONE AGAINS BUT THAT IS 
ANOTHER POINT YOU SAY IN THE 
FUTURE INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE BEN 
FIGHT FROM MORE CHOICE SURELY THAT 
WOULD BE A BIZARRE SITUATION IF I 
HAD MY LITTLE LETTER TO POST TO 
NICK WOOD I COULD POP DOWN AND HAVE 
TWO OR THREE LETTER BOXS TO CHOOSE 
FROM AND TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT 
STAMPS WE WILL NEVER GET TO THAT 
SITUATION 
PROBABLY NOT THERE IS SITUATION ALL SORTS OF MODELS OF COMPETITION 
BUT THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE ARE 
TALKING SOLELY ABOUT ONE COMPANY 
PICKING UP EVERYTHING AND DEALING 
WITH THE WHOLE PROCESS OF MAIL FROM 
START TO FINISH 
WE HEARD IN 
RACHEL'S REPORT ONE USER SAYING 
WELL I THINK IT WAS EVEN SAYING 
INDIFFERENT SORT OF INDIFFERENT TO 
THE SERVICE IT IS ALL RIGHT DO 
YOU THINK H. IS WHERE WE WILL BE OR 
DO YOU THINK WE CAN SEE ANY MAJOR 
IMPROVEMENT 
THE SITUATION CAN'T IMPROVEMENT STAY AS IT IS AND THAT IS WHAT EVEN 
IS AGREED ON THAT IS WHAT THE 
REPORT MADE CLEAR THAT EVERYONE 
AGREES THE SITUATION CAN'T STAY 
IT IS BECAUSE OVERALL VOLUMES ARE 
DECK LEAN THE MARKET IS CHANGE 
PEOPLE ARE TEXTING MORE PHONING 
MORE USING THE INTERNET BUT ON THE 
OTHER HAND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL 
MORE SHOPPING ON LINE AND THAT 
SHOPPING NEEDS TO BE DELIVERED SO 
ROYAL MAIL NEEDS TO UP ITS GAME IN 
TERMS OF DELIVERY OF PARCELS SO 
THEY CAN BE DELIVERED AT TIMES WHEN 
PEOPLE ARE ROUND TO RECEIVE THEM 
THERE IS A WHOLE NEW RANGE OF 
OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS 
DIFFICULTIES BUT THE SITUATION IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE 
IN ITS 
RESPONSE TO THIS REPORT ROYAL MAIL 
ITSELF SAYS IT IS FAR AHEAD OF ANY 
OTHER MAJOR EUROPEAN COUNTRY DO 
YOU ACCEPT THAT 
IN SOME RESPECTS 
THE PRICES AT THE LOWER END OF THE 
EUROPEAN SPECTRUM THE QUALITY IS 
ROUND NEARISH THE TOP OF MOST 
EUROPEAN COUNTRY BUT THEY HAVE A 
LONG WAY TO GO YET L. AM SURE I 
DON'T BELIEVE ROYAL MAIL ARE 
COMPLACENT ABOUT THIS AND THEY 
SHOULDN'T BE 
THANK YOU LET US

COMPANIES ARE DOING VERY WELL 
TULLOW OIL ANNOUNCED IT HAS FOUND A 
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OIL OFF THE 
COAST OF GARRN GHANA AND THIS IS 
A FEATURE OF THE SECTOR THIS 
PARTICULAR TYPE OF COMPANY IT IS 
NOT A BIG CONGLOMERATE LIKE SHELL 
OR B. P. IF YOU FIND SOMETHING RICH 
IT GOES MAD AND I AM WAITING FOR 
DRAMATIC BIT BIGGER BLOCK AND 
THAT IS THE COMPANY I AM TALKING 
ABOUT THE SHARE IS WELL OFF THERE

TODAY LET US BRING IT DOWN TO 
EARTH TULLOE UP UP ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN PENCE ON A 
SHARE PRICE OF NINE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN AMAZING THERE

A REVIEW INTO 
BUSINESS PRACTICES AT THE DEFENCE 
FIRM B. A. SYSTEMS HAS CALLED FOR 
TOUGHER ANTI BRIBERY MEASURES LORD 
WOOLF SET OUT TWENTY RECOMMENDATION FOR 
THE FIRM THERE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY 
BEEN INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE FIRM 
THAT IS A NICE SHOT LET US GIT RID 
OF THAT B. A. E. SYSTEMS DOWN FIVE PENCE 
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IS VERY MUCH 
THE MEASURE OF THE MARKET YOLK WE 
WILL SEE THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED DOING VERY 
WELL MUCH MILLENNIUM AND 
COPTHORNE REPORTED FIRST QUARTER 
PRE TAX PROFITS UP ELEVEN PER CENT THEIR 
SHARES ARE DOWN AS ARE 
INTERCONTINENTAL F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IT IS 
DOWN FORTY THREE BUT THE SECOND TYRE OF 
COMPANIES ARE MANAGING A RICE TIER 
ESTATE AGENTS FEES ARE A 
SIGNIFICANT COST WHEN IT COMES TO 
SELLING A PROPERTY BUT ONE WORKING 
LUNCH VIEWER HAS HAD TO PAY THEM 
TWICE COSTING HER THOUSANDS OF 
POUNDS SHE CONTACTED US AND IN A 
MOMENT WE WILL ASK THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF ESTATE AGENTS AND 
COMMENT ON IT FIRST LET US HEAR 
HER STORY THIS IS MARY QAIF 
HAVING INHERIT HEAD MOTHER'S HOUSE 
SHE DECIDED TO PUT OUT IT 
MARKETMENT SHE PICKS UP THE STORY 
WE PUT THE HOUSE ON THE ONE AGENT 
MARKETMENT SHE PICKS UP THE STORY WE PUT THE HOUSE ON THE ONE AGENT 
IN DORCHESTER THEY WERE VERY 
HELPFUL EXTREMELY GOOD AFTER 
ABOUT THREE OR FOUR MONTHS IT 
HADN'T SOLD SO WE DECIDED WE WOULD 
TAKE IT OFF THE MARKET THEN WE 
WOULD PUT IT ON WITH ANOTHER AGENT 
WE WOULD RELAUNCH IT 
WHICH WE DULY 
DID THE BUNGALOW WAS SOLD PAID 
ALL THE FEES SOLICIT WEPT THROUGH 
DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING MORE ABOUT IT 
AT ALL AND THEN THIS JANUARY WE HAD 
A LETTER THROUGH TO SAY THAT WE 
OWED THE ORIGINAL ESTATE AGENTS A 
FEE OF EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AS WELL AS PAYING THE 
OTHER AGENT WHAFRPBLGTS HAS 
HAPPENED WAS THAT THE PERSON WHO 
BOUGHT MARY'S MOTHERS HOUSE HAD 
BEEN INTRODUCED BY HER FIRST ESTATE 
AGENTS SO UNDER THE TERMS OF THE 
CONTRACT THEY WERE ENTITLED TO 
THEIR FULL FEE 
TO MAKE MATTERS 
WORSE THEY ASKED FOR A PERCENTAGE 
OF THE ORIGINAL HIGHER PRICE THE THE BUNGALOW WAS ON THE MARKET FOR 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WE SOLD IT FOR FIFTY FIVE BUT 
PALMER SMELL HAVE COME BACK AND 
SAID THAT THE FEE THEY WANT IS ON 
THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THE ORIGINAL WHICH YOUZ 
CAN IMAGINE WE DID FEEL FURIOUS 
ABOUT BEAR IN MIND WE PRO REDUCED 
THE HOUSE TO SELL IT QUICK LIRK IN 
ORDER MY CHILDREN COULD INHERIT 
MONEY AND WE CAN HELP MY DAUGHTER 
WHO CO GOT MARRIED KRE RECENTLY 
ALL THOSE THINGS THAT REALLY REALLY 
MADE US ANGRY AND I JUST THINK 
THAT IS TOTALLY UNJUST 
MARY SAYS 
THE FIRST AGENTS DIDN'T NOTIFY HER 
THE BUYERS HAS LOOKED ROUND THE 
PROPERTY THE AGENERALS SAY THEY 
HER A LIST OF VIEWINGS AND THE 
CASE IS BEFORE THE OMBUDSMAN BUT 
MARY BELIEVES HER EXPERIENCE DEMON 
STRAYS A BIG PROBLEM WITH THE 
PROCESS OF CHANGING AGENTS THERE 
IS NO STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR 
KEEPING EVERYBODY IN THE LOOP THE THE DOCUMENTATION YOU HAVE TO SIGN THE 
LEGAL FORMS SHO EXACTLY THE SAME 
REGARDLESS OF WHICH ESTATE AGENT 
THAT YOU USE AND INDEED THE 
LETTER WHICH GIVES YOU THE 
INFORMATION ABOUT WHO HAS LOOKED 
ROUND YOUR PROPERTY SHOULD BE SENT 
BOTH TO THE NEXT ESTATE AGENT AND 
POSSIBLY TO YOUR SOLICITOR AS WELL 
AND THE COPY I RECEIVE AT HOME OR 
ONE RECEIVES AT HOME OUGHT TO BE 
SENT BY REGISTERS POST SO THAW I 
KNOW YOU HAVE RECEIVED IT AND YOU 
KNOW YOU ARE EXPECTING IT 
FOLLOWING THAT CONTACT WE TRIED THE 
ESTATE AGENTS INVOLVED IN THIS 
STORERY PALMER SMELL DECLINED TO 
COMMENT BECAUSE THEY SAID THE CASE 
IS GOING BEFORE THE OMBUDSMAN WE 
CONTACTED GOADSBYS BUT THEY ARE NOT 
ABLE TO COMMENT SOMEBODY WHO WILL 
BE WE HOPE IS PETER BOLTON KING 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS 
IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE SET OF 
CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK YOUR PERSON 
THERE MADE SOME VERY VERY 
IMPORTANT COMMENTS 
IMPORTANT COMMENTS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IS THAT 
AGENTS AS YOU WILL BE AWARE ARE 
NOT PROPERLY CONTROLLED AND IT'S UP 
TO AGENTS TO DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT 
TO DO THE FIRST AGENT HERE AND I 
DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE 
SPECIFICS BECAUSE THE OMBUDSMAN IS 
INVOLVED HERE UNDER THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION'S CODE YOU DO HAVE TO 
WRITE TO YOUR CLIENT WHEN THEY 
DISINSTRUCT YOU EXPLAINING UNDER 
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES THEY MIGHT BE 
LIABLE AND BEST PRACTICE IS TO 
PRODUCE THAT LIST 
WHAT WOULD SAY FOLLOWING ON FROM 
THAT THE SELLER SHOULD PROTECT 
THEMSELVES IF THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED 
THAT LIST OR THE AGENT REFUSES TO 
SEND THEM BY WRITING TO THE AGENT 
SAYING YOU DO NOT THINK THAT 
ANYBODY AS FAR AS YOU ARE 
CONCERNED HAS BEEN INTRODUCED TO 
THE PROPERTY THAT WOULD HAVE 
AVOIDED THIS PROBLEM 
WE WILL COME 
TO THE REGULATORY BODIES OR LACK 
OF IN A MOMENT YOU RAISE A GOOD 
POINT LET'S STICK WITH MARY'S CASE 
THE ORIGINAL FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ASKING PRICE 
THAT CAN'T BE WRITE WHEN THEY'RE 
ASKING FOR A SHARE OF THE LARGER 
PRICE WHEN THE HOUSE WAS SOLD FOR 
LESS 
THAT BIT DOES I HAVE TO SAY LESS DOES PUZZLE ME SLIGHTLY AS YOU 
WILL BE AWARE UNDER NORMAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES YOU PAY A COMMISSION 
ON THE SELLING PRICE NOW I DON'T 
KNOW WHAT THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT 
SAID I CAN'T COMMENT ON THAT 
LET'S LOOK AT THE WAY ESTATE AT ARE 
GOVERNED ONE OF THE REAL STUNNING 
POINTS THAT CAME OUT OF THAT WHEN 
WE HAVE LOOKED AT IT IS THE FACT 
THAT ALTHOUGH BODIES LIKE YOURS ARE 
VERY LAUDABLE YOU HAVE NO TEETH 
BECAUSE THERE IS NO BODY THAT 
SPECIFICALLY HAS STATUTORY RIGHTS 
OVER ESTATE AGENTS IS THAT RIGHT 
CAN IT BE RIGHT ON HOUSE SALE 
CLEARLY WE'VE ALWAYS SAID AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO SAY THAT IS A LUDICROUS 
SITUATION GENERALLY THE 
PROFESSION ARE QUITE HAPPY TO HAVE 
THE SORT OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN 
TALKED ABOUT LIKE A SINGLE 
STANDARD AGENCY AGREEMENT TO HAVE 
THESE SINGLE CODES OF CONDUCT YOU 
ARE RIGHT THOUGH THAT THE ONLY 
PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SEEM TO 
UNDERSTAND THIS ARE THE GOVERNMENT 
I'M PLEASED TO SAY THERE ARE 
SEVERAL REVIEWS GOING ON AT THE 
MOMENT WHICH WILL COME OUT IN JUNE 
I'M KEEPING MY FINGERS FIRMLY 
CROSSED THAT THEY WILL BACK US UP 
AND THAT EVERY ACT SHOULD HAVE TO 
MEET MINIMUM COMPETENCY STANDARDS 
ONE OF THE THINGS WE ALWAYS TRY AND 
LOOK AT IN THIS PROGRAMME ARE 
THERE MORE CASES OUT THERE LET'S 
ASSUME IF MARY'S CONTACTED US 
THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE CASES OUT 
THERE WHAT PRACTICAL ADVICE CAN 
YOU GIVE TO TRY AND AVOID MORE 
MARYS OF THE FUTURE 
I THINK THERE 
IS ONLY ONE WAY YOU CAN DO THIS AT 
THE END OF THE DAY A COURT WILL 
LOOK AT WHAT THE CONTRACT SAYS AND 
THEY WILL ALSO SAY WHAT WAS 
REASONABLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
IT'S THE SMALL PRINT AGAIN 
IT IS 
THE SMALL PRINT GET THAT LIST 
CONFIRM IN WRITING TO THE AGENT 
THAT THEY'VE SENT THAT LIST TO THE 
SECOND AGENT MAKE SURE THE SECOND 
AGENT UNDERSTANDS IF ANYBODY FROM 
THAT LIST GOES TO TALK TO THEM THEY 
NEED TO BE REFERRED BACK TO THE 
FIRST AGENT IF IT HAD THAT 
SITUATION I THINK THIS COULD HAVE 
BEEN AVOIDED 
PETER BOLTON KING 
FROM THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
ESTATE AGENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH

FURTHER BY THE WORKERS FLOCKING

INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
THIS IS THE DISH THAT THE POTTERIES 
FOUND WAS GOING TO BE VERY USEFUL 
IT WAS THE LACK OF BREAD THE LACK 
OF IMMEDIATE BREAD THE RACE IN

POPULATION JUST ABSOLUTELY EXPLODED 
THIS WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT 
PEOPLE WERE EXISTING ON THIN BREAD 
THIN OATCAKES MADE OUT OF THE 
EASIEST FORM OF GRAIN AND'S OAT 
MEAL OATCAKE SHOPS ARE VERY MUCH 
PART OF THE TRADITION OF INDUSTRIAL 
STOKE ON TRENT STOKE ON TRENT WE'VE LOST THE INDUSTRY IN STOKE

HIT THE PLACE

SHORTAGE OF KUST MESS FOR THE 
OATCAKES WHEN THE DEVELOPERS DO

TRADITIONAL WAY

WHEN I WAS ON THE ROAD FOR WORKING 
LUNCH I HAD A GO AND I WAS RUBBISH 
THE BIGGEST PROVIDER OF CHILD TRUST 
FUNDS SAYS THE TAX FREE SAVINGS 
SKEEMENTS SCHEMES FOR NEW BORNS ARE 
TURNING THE CORNER FAMILY 
INVESTMENTS CLAIMS THAT MORE THAN 
FOUR IN FIVE PARENTS ARE USING THE 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY VOUCHERS THEY GET FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT TO OPEN ACCOUNTS RATHER 
THAN LEAVING THEM DRAWER OR ON 
THE MANTLEPIECE AT THE SAME TIME 
THERE ARE WORRIES THAT ECONOMIC 
UNCERTAINTY MEANS THAT FAMILIES 
HAVE GOT LESS CASH TO PUT INTO THE 
SCHEMES ONCE THEY'RE SET UP SIMON 
HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THIS FIRST OF 
ALL REMIND US WHAT THESE FUNDS 
ARE NOTHING'S EVER THAT SIMPLE 
TAX FREE SAVING SCHEME FOR THE 
BENEFIT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN 
THEY'RE BORN THEY GET TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FREE 
SO TO SPEAK FROM THE TAXPAYER TO 
PUT IN THEIR FUND IF THEY FAIL TO 
OPEN A ACCOUNT AFTER YEAR THE 
GOVERNMENT DOES IT FOR YOU YOU CAN 
TOP IT UP BY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED A YEAR WHEN 
THE CHILD IS ONE THEY CAN TAKE THE 
BENEFIT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IS 
THAT FROM THE BEGINNING THERE WAS 
A LARGE PROPORTION OF PARENTS WHO 
JUST SIMPLY DID NOTHING WITH THE 
VOUCHER SO THE CHILD WOULD 
EVENTUALLY GET THE FUND OPENED UP 
FOR THEM BUT INITIALLY IT WAS TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
THEN IT WAS AROUND THIRTY PER CENT DID NOTHING 
WITH THEIR VOUCHERS THAT MEANT 
THEY MISSED OUT ON THE FIRST YEAR'S 
GROWTH AND THAT WAS THE SITUATION 
UNTIL LAST YEAR WHAT FAMILY 
INVESTMENTS IS SAYING ACCORDING TO 
THEIR SURVEY IT'S ABOUT EIGHTY TWO PER CENT OF 
PEOPLE ARE OPENING THEM THAT'S 
COMPARED TO SIXTY FOUR PER CENT TWO TO THREE YEARS 
AGO ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS FINALLY 
STARTED WRITING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
NOT SENT THEIR VOUCHERS IN TO OPEN 
THE ACCOUNT THAT SEEMS TO BE 
HAVING AN EFFECT 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
AND THE ECONOMIC CYCLE HAS BEEN 
HAVING SOME STRANGE EFFECTS ON 
SAVINGS AND BONDS WHAT HAS BEEN 
THE EFFECT HERE WHAT IS THE 
CURRENT SITUATION REGARDING RATES 
NOT BAD IF YOU ARE IN A SITUATION 
WHERE YOU WILL OPEN ONE OF THESE 
CHILD TRUST FUND ACCOUNTS LET'S 
LOOK AT THE INTEREST BEARING ONES 
THEY'RE LIKE 
BANK ACCOUNT HERE ARE THE SORT OF TOP OF THE TABLE THEY'RE GOOD RATES THOSE ARE THE BANK ACCOUNT TYPE ONES YOU CAN DO 
A STAKEHOLDER WHICH IS LINKED TO 
THE STOCK MARKET HERE ARE THE ONES 
THAT HAVE DONE WELL OVER THE LAST 
THREE YEARS SINCE THE ACCOUNT 
STARTED UP 
THE OTHERS HAVE ALL GONE DOWN I'M 
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT YOU WOULD TAKE 
AWAY FROM THAT IF YOU ARE STARTING 
A CHILD TRUST FUND YOU WANT TO BE 
WITH THE MARKET WHEN IT'S DOWN 
RATHER THAN UP WHEN YOU START 
PUTTING MONEY IN YOU HOPE IT GOES 
UP THEN 
IT'S ONE THING HAVING THE 
POWER TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT IT'S 
ANOTHER THING WHAT YOU PUT INTO IT 
IS THAT AFFECTED BY A LACK OF 
CONFIDENCE 
YES THE GOVERNMENT'S CONFIDENCE INTENTION WE WOULD SAVE SAVE AND 
SAVE FOR KIDS SO THEY WOULD HAVE A 
NEST EGG WHEN THEY REACHED THE AGE 
OF EIGHTEEN HERE ARE THE FIGURES FOR 
PARENTS TOPPING UP AT THE MOMENT 
ABOUT TWENTY THREE PER CENT OF PARENTS DO PROVIDE A 
REGULAR TOP UP THE AVERAGE AMOUNT 
IS ONE POINT SIX FOUR A MONTH THAT'S GONE UP 
SLIGHTLY OVER A YEAR THAT WOULD 
BE TWO HUNDRED FORTY THE LUMP SUM AVERAGE IS 
FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY LET'S HAVE A LISTEN TO ONE OF THE 
PROVIDERS IT'S ENGAGED MUTUAL 
INSURANCE THEY'RE WORRIED BECAUSE 
THEY'VE DONE A SURVEY OF WHAT 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS YEAR 
WE ASKED PARENTS WHETHER THEY WOULD 
CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO SPEND AS 
MUCH MONEY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AS THEY HAD IN 
THE PAST ON THEIR CHILDREN OVER A 
WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS WHETHER IT 
WAS TAKING THEM OUT FOR DAY TRIPS 
GOING ON HOLIDAY PAYING FOR SCHOOL 
TRIPS MORE CLOTHES GAMES AND 
ALSO WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO CONTINUE 
SAVING WHAT WE FOUND IS ONE IN 
FIVE PARENTS FELT THEY WOULDN'T BE 
ABLE TO SAVE AS MUCH IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
GENERALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE 
CONCERNED THEY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE 
CUTBACKS 
A BIT 
OF WORRY WITH TALK CUTBACKS OF A SLOWDOWN PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH AND NOT HAVING 
SO MUCH MONEY AVAILABLE 
LOTS OF INFORMATION AROUND THESE
