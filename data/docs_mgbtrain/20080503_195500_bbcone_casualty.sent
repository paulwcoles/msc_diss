CHRISTINA ARE YOU O. K. 
DON'T WORRY I'M FINE 
THIS IS GILL FLORENCE HI GILL I'M DOCTOR TRUMAN 
SHE WAS HIT BY A MOTORBIKE ABOUT FORTY M. P. H. WHILST CROSSING THE ROAD 
G. C. S. OF FOURTEEN ON ARRIVAL COMPOUND FRACTURE TO LEFT FEMUR 
DOCTOR WINTERS WAS ON THE SCENE AND REALIGNED 
TRACTION APPLIED TO REGAIN PERFUSION SATS OF NINETY EIGHT PER CENT 
TWENTY M. G. OF MORPHINE ONE LITRE OF SALINE B. SLASH P. MAINTAINED AT ONE HUNDRED TEN SYSTOLIC O. K. EVERYONE ON ME 
ONE TWO THREE 
WAYNE CAN YOU CROSS MATCH HER FOR EIGHT UNITS AND ORGANISE A SERIES OF C. SPINE CHEST AND PELVIS PLEASE 
MY DAUGHTER SHE IS BEING BROUGHT TO THE SAME HOSPITAL YEAH YOU'RE O. K. DARLING 
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT 
MICHAEL FIND ROSE SHE'LL BE ALL BY HERSELF 
I'M FINE 
I'VE GOT MY LOVELY DOCTOR LOOKING AFTER ME PLEASE 
YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER 
SHE'S VERY PRECIOUS TO ME COURSE WE WILL SIR SORRY YOU O. K. 
BLIMEY WHEN DID WE ALL GET SO POLITE ROUND HERE WHAT POSITION WAS THE LEG IN WHEN YOU FOUND HER 
THE FEMUR AND HIP WERE DISPLACED WITH VASCULAR COMPROMISE TO THE LOWER LEG 
CAP REFILL FIVE SECONDS PALE COLD AND PAINFUL WITH PARAESTHESIA 
I HAD TO REDUCE THE FRACTURE TO SAVE THE LEG GOOD WORK CAN WE GET A FEMORAL NERVE BLOCK HERE 
ALL RIGHT PEEPS I'VE BEEN SENT DOWN TO HAVE A LOOK AT THIS LADY 
BIT QUICK TOBES YEAH DOCTOR WINTERS MANAGED TO DO ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY AT THE SCENE 
WE'LL TELL YOU ONCE THE PATIENT'S SORTED I HAVE TO CLERK HER 
NO YOU HAVE TO WAIT WE HAVEN'T COMPLETED THE PRIMARY SURVEY SO 
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RHINOCEROS AND AN ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEON I DON'T KNOW 
ONE'S THICK SKINNED HAS A VERY SMALL BRAIN AND CHARGES A LOT FOR NO REASON AND THE OTHER'S 
A RHINOCEROS 
ADAM THANK YOU I'M HERE ALL WEEK WHAT'S EVERYONE GOT AGAINST ORTHOPODS 
OH IT'S PURELY PROFESSIONAL JEALOUSY THEY'RE IN IT FOR THE MONEY NOT THE MEDICINE 
PLANNING ON OPENING A LUCRATIVE PRACTICE SOME DAY THERE'S NO PEDAL PULSE 
NO IT'S INTERMITTENT BUT IT IS THERE RIGHT WELL SOUNDS LIKE THE FRACTURE'S IN A GOOD POSITION 
BUT I THINK IT NEEDS RE MANIPULATION BEFORE SHE GOES TO THEATRE 
MY SUGGESTION REMOVE THE DONWAY AND REAPPLY A THOMAS SPLINT SORRY NO SHE'S NOT PROPERLY RESUSCITATED YET 
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE'S SOME SOFT TISSUE CAUGHT BETWEEN THE FRACTURE ENDS 
WHICH MAKE THE REDUCTION SUBOPTIMAL SHE HAS DECENT CIRCULATION 
I WON'T MESS AROUND CHANGING SPLINTS UNTIL SHE'S HAEMO DYNAMICALLY STABLE IS THAT CLEAR 
COMPROMISED CIRCULATION IN THE LEG COULD BE PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE HEART 
IT COULD BE A TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX WHY SHE'S HYPOTENSIVE AND HER B. P.'S ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIFTHS 
ANOTHER BAG OF SALINE PLEASE 
I'M GOING TO HAVE A LOOK NO TOBY GET OUT OF THE WAY 
WE'LL SEND HER UP WHEN SHE'S READY THEN YOU AND YOUR LITTLE GANG CAN HAVE A PLAY WITH HER
