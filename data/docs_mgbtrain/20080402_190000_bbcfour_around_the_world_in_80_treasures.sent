FIVE MONTHS AGO I SET OUT TO DISCOVER EIGHTY OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST TREASURES 
NOW I'M ALMOST BACK ON HOME TERRITORY 
I'M EXCITED IT FEELS LIKE SEEING OLD FRIENDS AGAIN 
BUT AFTER ALL MY INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCES AND TREASURES FROM RIGHT AROUND THE GLOBE 
WILL I SEE THESE FAMILIAR SIGHTS IN A NEW LIGHT 
I'VE NOW ALMOST CIRCUMNAVIGATED THE GLOBE 
AND AM ABOUT TO START MY LAST LAP IN WHAT USED TO BE CALLED YUGOSLAVIA 
I'M IN BOSNIA A COUNTRY THAT HAS UNTIL RECENTLY 
BEEN DOMINATED BY WAR TO SEE IF MAN MADE BEAUTY IF HISTORY 
IF ARCHITECTURE CAN HELP IN HEALING THIS LAND 
THE HISTORIC TOWN OF MOSTAR FELL VICTIM TO THE VIOLENCE AND IGNORANCE OF WARFARE 
IT REMAINS TODAY A PAINFUL REMINDER OF YUGOSLAVIA'S TRAGIC DESCENT INTO CHAOS 
TEN YEARS AGO IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES 
THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS VIOLENT PLACES ON EARTH 
WITH THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION 
MOSTAR GOT DRAGGED INTO A BITTER GENOCIDAL CIVIL WAR 
WITH THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES ROMAN CATHOLIC CROATS 
CHRISTIAN ORTHODOX BOSNIAN SERBS AND MUSLIMS FIGHTING TO SURVIVE 
AND IT'S IN THIS RATHER UNLIKELY SETTING I HAVE COME TO FIND MY NEXT TREASURE 
IT'S A TREASURE THAT DIED BLASTED TO DESTRUCTION IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE BY CHRISTIAN CROAT TROOPS 
BUT IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WORK BEGAN TO REBUILD THE BRIDGE 
IDENTICAL IN FORM AND USING AS MUCH OF THE ORIGINAL FABRIC AS POSSIBLE 
THE MOSTAR BRIDGE WOULD LIVE AGAIN 
IT REALLY IS THE MOST WONDERFUL MINIMAL ENGINEERED CONSTRUCTION 
SO ELEGANT 
THE BRIDGE WAS BUILT ON THE DIRECT ORDERS OF THE GREATEST OF THE OTTOMAN RULERS 
SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT 
AND WHEN THE BRIDGE WAS COMPLETED IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX IT WAS THE LARGEST SINGLE SPAN BRIDGE IN THE WORLD 
IT LEAPS ACROSS THE RIVER IN AN ARCH OF ALMOST THIRTY METRES 
WHEN IT WAS BUILT BOSNIA WAS A RECENT ACQUISITION OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE 
THE LONG ESTABLISHED CHRISTIANS HAVING TO ACCOMMODATE THE CONQUERING MUSLIMS 
SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT WANTED THE MOSTAR BRIDGE TO ACT AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN PEOPLES 
HOW DID THE PEOPLE OF MOSTAR RESPOND TO THIS RATHER POLITICAL GESTURE 
WELL THEY BOTH CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS TOOK IT TO THEIR HEARTS 
IT BECAME A SYMBOL OF UNITY OF IDENTITY OF PRIDE 
BUT NOW IT'S BEEN REBUILT DOES IT MEANS THE SAME ANY MORE 
CAN AN OLD BUILDING STILL HAVE MEANING 
WHEN IT'S A RECONSTRUCTED OLD BUILDING 
IN THIS CASE A BRIDGE WELL I THINK THE ANSWER IS YES 
PROVIDING THE RECONSTRUCTION IS AUTHENTIC 
AUTHENTIC MATERIALS AUTHENTIC MEANS OF CONSTRUCTION 
THESE ARE PARTS OF THE OLD BRIDGE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REUSED 
BUT MOST OF THE STONES THAT WERE FOUND HAVE BEEN PUT BACK IN PLACE 
SO TO ME IT IS STILL A LIVING OLD BUILDING 
AH NOW VERY TRADITIONAL 
GOLLY A VERY BRAVE YOUNG MAN 
OH YES 
CERTAINLY THE AGE OLD CUSTOM OF JUMPING OFF THE BRIDGE TO PROVE YOUR MANHOOD IS ALIVE AND WELL 
BUT HAS THE MEANING OF THE BRIDGE THIS ANCIENT SYMBOL BEEN LOST TO LOCAL MUSLIMS 
HAS REBUILDING THIS ANCIENT BRIDGE HELPED TO HEAL WOUNDS HELPED TO REUNITE THE COMMUNITY OF MOSTAR 
IT DID HELP BUT IT'S JUST ANOTHER STEP 
WE NEED MUCH MORE TO DO TO HEAL OUR WOUNDS 
AND WHEN YOU WALK ACROSS THE NEW BRIDGE DOES IT FEEL AS IF THE OLD BRIDGE HAS COME BACK TO LIFE 
I THINK IT'S THE OLD BRIDGE 
YEAH TO ME IT FEELS LIKE AN OLD BRIDGE AND JUST FOR TEN YEARS UNFORTUNATELY IT WASN'T HERE 
YES BUT IT'S NOW COME BACK TOGETHER 
AND NOW THE CATHOLIC CROATS 
AND THE MUSLIMS AND MAYBE THE ORTHODOX BOSNIAN SERBS NOW TEND TO LIVE SEPARATELY 
THEY USED TO BE LIVING IN ONE 
YES MIXED UP THEY THEY WERE MIXED UP 
IT WASN'T IMPORTANT WHAT RELIGION YOU WERE BUT NOW IT IS M. M. M. 
THERE IS TOO MUCH ANGER I THINK 
BUT THE BRIDGE IS A STEP YES YES IT IS A HUGE STEP 
IN THE NARROW STREETS ALONGSIDE THE BRIDGE STALLS SELLING SOUVENIRS HAVE OPENED UP 
OPTIMISTICALLY AWAITING THE RETURN OF TOURISTS TO MOSTAR 
THE STRANGEST THING 
THIS STALL THIS SHOP IS FULL OF UM SHELLS 
NOT SEASIDE SHELLS BUT THESE MONSTERS 
BRASS SHELLS FIRED FROM GUNS MACHINE GUNS AND CANON 
THAT'S A FIFTY CALIBRE ONE I THINK 
ORNAMENTAL NOW 
CARVED WITH UM PATTERNS AND LOCAL SCENES 
UNBELIEVABLE 
THERE IS THE IMAGE OF THE MOSTAR BRIDGE 
COULD BE THE VERY SHELL OF ONE OF THEM THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DESTROYING IT 
GOD WHAT A KIND OF BIZARRE IRONY 
THESE SHELLS YOU'RE SELLING YES THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY 
THESE ARE SHELLS THAT WERE FIRED DURING THE FIGHTING AROUND HERE YES 
DO YOU FIND IT ODD MAKING ORNAMENTAL THINGS OUT OF 
OUT OF THESE SHELLS I MEAN WHICH WANT TO DESTROY THE BRIDGE HERE THE CITY HERE PEOPLE 
ER WE SEE IT LIKE THIS 
FROM FROM WAR TO ART 
FAIR ENOUGH ABSOLUTELY 
CAN REBUILDING AN ANCIENT STRUCTURE IN A BEAUTIFUL LOCATION REALLY HELP REBUILD 
A SHATTERED COMMUNITY AND ESPECIALLY ONE THAT TORE ITSELF APART 
IN SUCH TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHERE BITTERNESS AND HATRED SURVIVES 
MOSTAR IS ONCE AGAIN A BEAUTIFUL PLACE FULL OF LIFE BUT THE BRIDGE IS LIKE A MASK 
SUPERFICIAL REALLY WORN OVER A SCARRED AND SNARLING FACE 
YOU CAN REBUILD THINGS THAT WERE OF BEAUTY 
YOU CAN REBUILD STRUCTURES 
BUT CAN YOU REALLY SO EASILY REBUILD A SHATTERED SOUL A BROKEN HEART 
TIME WILL TELL 
FROM BOSNIA I FLY TO GREECE 
ONCE HOME TO A GREAT AND ANCIENT CIVILISATION 
TO TELL THE TRUTH I'M FEELING PRETTY ANCIENT MYSELF 
I'M LEAVING ATHENS AIRPORT THIS MUST BE ABOUT THE NINETIETH FLIGHT 
TO BE QUITE HONEST BETWEEN YOU AND ME 
I'M PRETTY EXHAUSTED 
ALSO EXHILARATED 
BY THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN 
ATHENS IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IS AN ENORMOUS POLLUTED CITY 
HIGH ON CARS LOW ON PARKS AND GREENERY 
YET IT MANAGES TO RETAIN A VILLAGE LIKE CHARM 
MY NEXT TREASURE STANDS RIGHT ABOVE ME BUT I'LL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL MORNING TO SEE IT 
AT THE TOP OF THIS HILL 
IS A BUILDING THAT SINCE ITS REDISCOVERY 
IN THE LATE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY HAS INFLAMED THE ARTISTIC IMAGINATION OF THE WEST 
IT'S BECOME KNOWN AS THE PERFECT PIECE OF ARCHITECTURE 
AND HAS GAINED GREECE THE REPUTATION OF BEING THE CRADLE OF CIVILISATION 
THE PARTHENON 
IT'S INSPIRED GREAT ARCHITECTURE GREAT ART 
ENTIRE CITIES 
MANY HAVE BELIEVED 
THAT IT REPRESENTS THE ORIGINS OF ARCHITECTURE THAT IT'S 
DIVINELY INSPIRED 
MANY OF THE WORLD'S GREAT ARTISTS AND ARCHITECTS HAVE COME HERE SEEN THIS BUILDING 
AND FALLEN ON THEIR KNEES 
THE PARTHENON WAS BUILT AROUND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY B. C. 
BY THE GREAT ATHENIAN LEADER PERICLES 
IT HOUSED A GIANT STATUE OF ATHENA THE GODDESS OF THE CITY 
AFTER THE DEMISE OF ANCIENT GREECE IT FELL INTO NEGLECT 
EVEN BEING TORN APART BY EXPLOSIONS IN A VENETIAN ATTACK IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
BUT EVEN IN ITS RUINED STATE IT WOULD COME TO INSPIRE THE MODERN WORLD 
IT'S BEAUTIFULLY BUILT OUT OF MARBLE ALL CARVED 
BUT STRUCTURALLY THE PARTHENON HAS LITTLE GOING FOR IT 
IT'S NOT PIONEERING IT'S NOT INGENIOUS NOR AMBITIOUS 
THERE'S NO ARCHES THERE'S NO VAULTS NO DOMES 
REALLY THE PARTHENON IS NO MORE ADVANCED STRUCTURALLY THAN STONEHENGE 
IT'S ALL VERY PRIMITIVE 
SO WHY IS THIS MY TREASURE 
IT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT IT CAME TO SYMBOLISE 
IT BECAME A POWERFUL EMBLEM OF A LOST CIVILISATION 
ITS RUINED STATE INSPIRED THE ARTISTS OF WESTERN EUROPE TO EXPLORE 
THE HEROISM AND TRAGEDY OF BATTERED BEAUTY AND DEFEATED AMBITIONS 
NO SURPRISE THE ROMANTIC POET BYRON LOVED THIS BUILDING 
BUT OUR EXPERIENCE 
IS NOW VERY DIFFERENT 
IN FACT 
THE PARTHENON IS NOW LARGELY A BUILDING SITE 
THIS IS THE MAIN ROUTE OF ENTRY TO THE PARTHENON IN ANCIENT TIMES 
UP THESE STEPS INTO WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DARK CHAMBER WITH THE GREAT GODDESS ATHENA 
SOMEWHERE IN THERE 
AND NOW ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE 
WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE 
ALL IS GONE ALL IS NOW CONSTRUCTION 
ATHENA THE GREAT GODDESS WOULD HAVE STOOD 
ROUGHLY HERE RIGHT WHERE THE CRANE IS NOW 
RESTORATION HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS MAKING GOOD POOR REPAIRS OF THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
AND BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS WILL CONTINUE FOR YEARS TO COME 
LOOKING ROUND ONE CAN'T HELP BUT CONCLUDE VERY SOON THIS BUILDING WILL BE AN AMALGAM OF OLD AND NEW 
OH IT'S ALL LADIES LADY MASONS 
HELLO 
YOU'RE REMOVING OLD REPAIRS AREN'T YOU THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON I CAN SEE THAT 
RESTORING OLD THINGS IS OFTEN A PROBLEM ISN'T IT COS ONE CAN IN THE PROCESS 
I DON'T KNOW REMOVE SOME OF THE MAGIC OF THE PLACE 
THE NEW MARBLE I KNOW IT COMES FROM THE SAME QUARRY BUT IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT TO THE OLD 
YES HOW WILL IT LOOK DO YOU THINK A SORT OF PATCHWORK OF OLD AND NEW 
WILL IT LOOK ALL RIGHT IN THE END I THINK YES 
I THINK IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT YEAH 
IT'S LOVELY TO SEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
GO ON THANKS BYE 
WELL NOBODY HERE SHARES MY WORRIES 
BUT TO ME IT FEELS LIKE THE RESTORATION IS SWAMPING THE MAGIC OF THE BUILDING 
BUILDINGS LIKE THE PARTHENON OF SUPREME HISTORIC AND ARCHITECTURAL IMPORTANCE 
MUST OF COURSE BE CONSERVED PRESERVED FOR POSTERITY 
BUT THIS IS MORE THAN THAT 
IT SEEMS TO ME THE PARTHENON'S BEING APPROPRIATED BY CONTEMPORARY POLITICS 
BEING MADE INTO A NATIONAL SYMBOL OF THE IMAGE 
OF MODERN GREECE 
AND THAT I FIND SAD AND WORRYING 
IF GUNPOWDER AND MISSILES CAN DESTROY HISTORIC TREASURES 
SO CAN OVER ZEALOUS RESTORATION EVEN WHEN WELL MEANING 
I LEAVE ATHENS AND HEAD FOR ANOTHER TREASURE AT RISK 
THIS TIME FROM THE RISING TIDES OF THE ADRIATIC SEA 
AFTER ALL MY TRAVELS WILL VENICE STILL FEEL THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITY IN THE WORLD 
TRADING GATEWAY TO THE EAST VENICE HAS BEEN THE MEETING PLACE 
OF TWO WORLDS FOR MORE THAN A THOUSAND YEARS 
HERE ART AND TRADE MARRY IN AN EXPLOSION OF SPLENDID PALACES AND MIRACULOUS CHURCHES 
AT ITS HEART LIES MY TREASURE 
IT IS THE MAIN ARTERY OF VENICE 
THE GRAND CANAL 
THERE'S NOTHING NOTHING LIKE THIS IN THE WORLD OF COURSE THERE'S NOT 
THIS GREAT HIGHWAY WATER HIGHWAY A HIGHWAY OF PALACES 
THIS SPECTACULAR ARCHITECTURE FLOATS IT SEEMS ON WATER 
THIS IS THE LARGEST CANAL IN VENICE 
A FUSION OF NATURE AND ENGINEERING 
HARNESSED BY MAN IT WEAVES ITS WAY THROUGH THE CITY 
LINED WITH PALACES BUILT ON STILTS HAMMERED DEEP INTO THE MUDDY WATERS 
THE PALACES WERE ALSO WAREHOUSES 
THE PRINCES ALSO MERCHANTS 
THE RICHES OF THE WORLD WERE BROUGHT TO VENICE 
FROM THE ORIENT SPICES AND SILK 
INDIA FROM DAMASCUS 
AND THESE RICHES WERE TRANSFORMED INTO ARCHITECTURE 
THE BUILDINGS SCREAM NOT JUST OF POWER AND OF WEALTH 
BUT ALSO OF ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD PARTICULARLY THE EAST 
ONE SEES AN ORIENTAL INFLUENCE 
ONE SEES MUSLIM INFLUENCE AS WELL AS CLASSICAL DESIGN 
A THING CALLED VENETIAN GOTHIC 
IT TAKES HALF AN HOUR TO MOTOR DOWN THE GRAND CANAL 
AND IT'S ONE OF THE BEST THIRTY MINUTES LIFE HAS TO OFFER 
HERE IS THE C. A. D'ORO ONE OF VENICE'S FINEST PALAZZOS 
IT WAS BUILT IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY AND ONCE SPARKLED WITH GOLD LEAF 
THEN THE RIALTO BRIDGE 
THE FIRST GREAT BRIDGE ACROSS THE GRAND CANAL 
LINKING THE COMMERCIAL HEART OF THE CITY WITH ITS POLITICAL HEAD 
VENICE IS MANY MANY THINGS BUT ONE THING IT IS OF COURSE 
IS FROZEN TIME 
THE CITY WE SEE NOW HAS CHANGED LITTLE SINCE THE MID SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
IT'S A HIGHWAY NOT JUST BACK IN TIME 
BUT THROUGH TIME 
THROUGH TASTE THROUGH CULTURE 
AND ALL AROUND LIE FEASTS 
ONE IS UTTERLY NOURISHED 
BY THESE IMAGES FROM THE GREAT MOMENTS OF WESTERN CIVILISATION 
IT'S JUST BREATHTAKING 
IT'S WITH RELUCTANCE THAT I LEAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL CITY 
HAPPILY MY NEXT DESTINATION IS SCARCELY LESS SPECTACULAR 
I'M IN ROME WHICH IS THE MOST SPELLBINDING CITY EVEN IN THE RAIN 
I'M HERE TO SEE THE BEST OF SURVIVING ANCIENT ROMAN ARCHITECTURE 
AND TO HELP ME ON THIS QUEST I'VE ER PICKED UP A CHARMING YOUNG MAN 
CALLED FRANCESCO WHO WILL DRIVE ME ROUND THE CITY ON HIS UM SCOOTER 
FRANCESCO HELLO HELLO 
I PASS SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS BUILDINGS IN THE WORLD 
ALL EVIDENCE OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE THAT FLOURISHED TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
BUT ONE IN PARTICULAR I CONSIDER BETTER THAN ALL THE REST 
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED GOODBYE GOODBYE 
UM CHARMING 
NOW HERE IT IS 
WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS BUILDING THIRTY YEARS AGO I WAS OVERWHELMED 
IT SEEMED TO ME TO BE THE EPITOME THE ESSENCE OF ARCHITECTURE 
IT'S THE PANTHEON 
THE BEST PRESERVED ROMAN TEMPLE IN THE WORLD 
THE PANTHEON WAS BUILT IN THE SECOND CENTURY AD BY EMPEROR HADRIAN 
PANTHEON MEANS ALL THE GODS 
AND LIKE SO MANY OF MY TREASURES THIS BUILDING HAD TO BE WORTHY OF DIVINE BEINGS 
IT ALSO HAD TO PROCLAIM TO THE WORLD THAT THE MIGHT OF ROME WAS UNRIVALLED 
THE FIRST THING YOU SEE AS YOU APPROACH THE PANTHEON 
IS THIS HUGE PORTICO WITH ITS TRIANGULAR PEDIMENT 
THIS IS VERY MUCH THE ARCHITECTURAL LANGUAGE OF ANCIENT GREECE 
SO HERE WE HAVE A GRECIAN ELEMENT BUT THERE'S MORE 
EACH COLUMN IS ONE GREAT STONE IT'S A MONOLITH 
AND THESE STONES WERE BROUGHT FROM NORTH AFRICA FROM EGYPT 
WHAT WE SEE HERE IS HADRIAN BRINGING THE CULTURE OF GREECE 
AND EGYPT TO ROME ABSORBING IT DEVELOPING IT SAYING WE ROME 
HAVE CONQUERED THESE ANCIENT AND GREAT CIVILISATIONS AND WE ARE THE NEW MASTERS OF THE WORLD 
BUT INSIDE IS A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD 
VERY ROMAN VERY PIONEERING VERY MODERN 
ESPECIALLY MODERN NEARLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO BECAUSE THERE'S A VAST COVERED SPACE 
THE AWE INSPIRING DOME IS MADE OF CONCRETE WHICH THE ROMANS INVENTED 
AND REMAINS THE LARGEST UN REINFORCED CONCRETE DOME IN THE WORLD 
HAVING MADE THE DOME OF CONCRETE AT LEAST THE DOME THEN IS A. 
IS A RIGID STRUCTURE WITH MINIMAL HORIZONTAL OUTWARD THRUST 
BUT IT DOES WEIGH AN AWFUL LOT 
AROUND FIVE THOUSAND TONNES 
AND THAT HAS TO BE CARRIED ON THE WALL BEHIND ME 
THE PROBLEM IS THIS WALL IS EATEN INTO BURROWED INTO BY A SERIES OF EIGHT NICHES 
HERE'S ONE BEHIND ME SO HOW ON EARTH DOES THIS SYSTEM WORK 
I'M NOW WALKING INTO THE WALL OF THE DRUM 
TO SEE HOW THIS FIVE THOUSAND TONNE CONCRETE DOME IS SUPPORTED 
AH NOW WHAT'S CLEAR IS THAT THE ER 
CURVED WALL OF THE DRUM IS NOT MADE OUT OF SOLID CONCRETE 
THERE ARE THESE GREAT BRICK ARCHES MASSIVELY STRONG 
AND THESE GREAT ARCHES TRANSFER THE LOAD OF THE DOME 
TO THE SOLID WALL EACH SIDE OF THE GREAT RECESSES SO THE GREAT DOME 
IS CARRIED REALLY BY GENIUS 
THE PANTHEON SHOWS THE ROMAN EMPIRE AT ITS PEAK 
FLEXING ITS MUSCLES 
SHOWING CAPABILITY AND INVENTION THAT EUROPE WOULD NOT EQUAL FOR NEARLY A THOUSAND YEARS 
BUT WHAT DID THIS HEROIC STRUCTURE MEAN 
MOST INTRIGUING I THINK IS THE OCULUS 
THE OPEN SPACE IN THE CENTRE OF THE DOME 
NOT JUST A DEMONSTRATION OF ENGINEERING SKILL TO CREATE A DOME WITHOUT A KEYSTONE 
BUT IT LETS THE LIGHT FLOOD IN IT LETS THE SUN IN 
THE SUN GOD IS PRESENT IS MADE MANIFEST WHEN THE SUN SHINES 
THE TRUTH IS THOUGH THIS GREAT BUILDING RETAINS ITS SECRET 
REMAINS MYSTERIOUS AND ENIGMATIC 
THE PANTHEON IS THE ANCESTOR OF EVERY DOME IN THE WESTERN WORLD 
AND TO LOOK AT THE SKYLINE OF ROME IS TO WITNESS EVOLUTION IN ARCHITECTURE 
BUT THE GLORY OF ROME WOULD LIE DORMANT UNTIL THE RENAISSANCE 
THE REBIRTH OF CLASSICAL GENIUS ART AND ARCHITECTURE IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY 
AT THE HEART OF THE RENAISSANCE WAS THE CITY OF FLORENCE 
ITS STREETS ARE LINED WITH BOLD CLASSICAL PALACES 
THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE THE DAYS OF ANCIENT ROME 
RENAISSANCE PRINCES WERE MASTERS OF THE USE OF ART AND ARCHITECTURE 
TO EXPRESS WEALTH AND POWER THEIR ASPIRATIONS 
THEY WERE AMONGST THE GREAT PATRONS OF THE ARTS THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN 
WITHOUT THEM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO RENAISSANCE OF THE ARTS 
THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF THE MIGHTY MEDICI FAMILY 
AND THEY BUILT THIS HUGE PALACE BEHIND ME IN THE ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTIES 
THIS THING WAS MEANT TO CAPTURE REFLECT 
THE POWER AND THE GLORY OF ANCIENT ROME 
THE MEDICI PRINCES RULED FLORENCE ON AND OFF 
FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
IT WAS THE MEDICI DYNASTY THAT CREATED MY NEXT TREASURE 
I'M IN SAN LORENZO 
THE SPIRITUAL STRONGHOLD OF THE MEDICI FAMILY 
AND WHAT I WANT TO SEE LIES THROUGH THAT DOOR OVER THERE 
THE MEDICI CHAPEL WAS CREATED BY MICHELANGELO IN THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTIES 
IT WAS COMMISSIONED BY CARDINAL GIULIO DI MEDICI AS A GREAT MAUSOLEUM FOR HIS FAMILY 
THIS BUILDING'S A DREAM 
IT'S A VISION OF DEATH 
IT'S THE THEATRE OF DEATH 
THE COLOURS THE MUTED LIGHT 
AT THE TOP THE WINDOWS TAPER 
AMAZING SO ONE CAN ALMOST FEEL ONE'S SOUL 
RISING UPWARDS AND OUT OF THIS SPACE 
THIS SPACE OF WORLDLY SUFFERING AND WOE 
THE CEILING OF THE CHAPEL IS A COPY IN MINIATURE OF THE PANTHEON DOME 
A BUILDING WHICH MICHELANGELO DESCRIBED AS OF ANGELIC DESIGN 
THE FOCUS OF THE BUILDING ITS VERY MEANING 
IS A PAIR OF FANTASTIC MEMORIALS TO MEMBERS OF THE MEDICI FAMILY 
HERE WE SEE 
TWO INCREDIBLY HAUNTING FIGURES 
NIGHT AND DAY 
AND THERE 
SHE'S LEANING UPON A PORTRAIT 
SELF PORTRAIT OF MICHELANGELO LOOKING WIZENED BY TIME 
WHEN THESE WERE MADE 
HE HIMSELF WAS IN A VERY STRANGE POSITION 
FLORENCE WAS IN THE GRIPS OF A POWER STRUGGLE 
THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY HAS RISEN UP IN A REPUBLICAN FRENZY AGAINST MEDICI TYRANNY 
WHICH SIDE WOULD MICHELANGELO CHOOSE 
MICHELANGELO SIDES WITH THE REPUBLIC AGAINST THE MEDICIS 
FRIGHTFUL BUSINESS SO HE'S HERE WORKING ON THE MEMORIAL TO MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY 
THAT HE IS FIGHTING AGAINST AND WHICH HE FEARS IF THEY WIN WILL PUT HIM TO DEATH 
IT WAS A TERRIBLE DILEMMA 
IN THE EVENT THE REVOLT WAS CRUSHED MEDICI RULE RESTORED 
SO MICHELANGELO WENT ON WORKING 
BUT AS HE DID HE FEARED RECRIMINATION 
A HIRED MEDICI ASSASSIN CREEPING UP BEHIND HIM AS HE WORKED 
PUNISHMENT FOR SUPPORTING THE REPUBLIC 
AS HE MADE THIS MONUMENT TO DEATH 
HE WAS HERE FEARING FOR HIS OWN LIFE 
WHEN HE CARVED THAT SELF PORTRAIT 
HE WAS REALLY CARVING HIS OWN DEATH MASK 
BUT THE LOVE OF ART MUST HAVE TRIUMPHED OVER A LUST FOR VENGEANCE 
BECAUSE THE HIRED ASSASSINS DIDN'T COME FOR MICHELANGELO 
WHAT'S BEEN FASCINATING ABOUT SEEING MICHELANGELO'S TOMB IS THAT UM 
IT'S REMINDED ME REALLY OF HOW MANY OF THE TREASURES I'VE SEEN 
IN THIS GREAT WORLD JOURNEY HAVE BEEN TO DO WITH DEATH 
I'VE SEEN HOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE DIFFERENT PLACES DIFFERENT TIMES HAVE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND 
THE MYSTERY OF DEATH THE PASSAGE THAT TAKES PLACE FROM LIFE TO DEATH 
IT REALLY IS QUITE HAUNTING QUITE STRANGE 
THERE IT IS DEATH THIS CONSTANT CONCERN 
LIFE AFTER DEATH RECYCLING OF THE HUMAN SOUL 
WHO KNOWS 
IT'S AMAZING REALLY THAT SO MUCH OF MAN'S CREATIVE ENERGY 
IS FOCUSED NOT ON LOVE ON LIFE 
BUT ON DEATH 
FROM ITALY TO SPAIN AND MY PENULTIMATE COUNTRY 
COMPARED TO MY DESTINATIONS OF THE PAST FEW DAYS MADRID IS A YOUNG CITY 
ONLY BECOMING CAPITAL OF SPAIN IN THE MID SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
BUT BEHIND THE IMPETUOUS ENERGY OF ITS YOUTH LURKS A DARK SPECTRE 
VISITING THIS COLOURFUL VIBRANT CITY 
IT'S EASY TO FORGET HOW RELATIVELY RECENTLY IT WAS IN THE GRIP OF A CIVIL WAR 
THAT MOST TERRIBLE EVENT WHEN A NATION TEARS ITSELF APART 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX GENERAL FRANCO LAUNCHED A FASCIST COUP AGAINST THE LEFT WING GOVERNMENT 
FOR THREE YEARS THE COUNTRY WAS RAVISHED BY FIGHTING 
EVIDENCE OF THIS DIVISION CAN STILL BE FOUND TODAY 
INDEED SHOCKINGLY AS RECENTLY AS MARCH TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
A STATUE OF THE TYRANT FRANCO WAS STILL STANDING 
THE MOST SHAMEFUL EPISODE OF THE CIVIL WAR TOOK PLACE ON THE TWENTY SIXTH OF APRIL NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN 
THAT'S WHEN THE BASQUE TOWN OF GUERNICA WAS BOMBED 
THE BASQUES AN AUTONOMOUS REPUBLIC WERE HOSTILE TO FRANCO AND HIS FORCES 
AND SO HE UNLEASHED HIS GERMAN ALLIES 
THE CONDOR LEGION OPERATING IN SPAIN ON THIS DEFENCELESS TOWN 
THE ATTACK LASTED FOR THREE AND A HALF HOURS IN THE END 
ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE WERE KILLED 
NINE HUNDRED INJURED AND MOST OF THE TOWN DAMAGED OR DESTROYED 
IT CAUSED INTERNATIONAL OUTRAGE 
MY NEXT TREASURE WAS CREATED IN RESPONSE TO THAT MASSACRE 
IT'S A WORK OF THE GREATEST PAINTER OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
AND IT'S GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL ANTI VIOLENCE 
ANTI WAR STATEMENTS EVER MADE 
IT STILL HAS THE POWER TO MOVE 
GUERNICA IS THE WORK OF PABLO PICASSO 
PICASSO A SPANIARD WAS APPALLED BY THIS ACT OF VIOLENCE BY FRANCO AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE 
THE DIFFICULTY PICASSO HAD WAS HOW TO RESPOND ARTISTICALLY TO THIS MASSACRE 
HE WAS APPALLED OUTRAGED POLITICALLY ENGAGED 
BUT HE KNEW THAT ART AND POLITICS RARELY MIX SUCCESSFULLY 
IF HIS PAINTING WAS TOO FULL OF OBVIOUS IMAGERY AGAINST WARFARE PLANES RAINING BOMBS 
AND COLLAPSING BUILDINGS HE COULD END UP MAKING NOTHING MORE THAN A PIECE OF PROPAGANDA 
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WANTED 
HE WANTED TO MAKE A TIMELESS IMAGE AGAINST VIOLENCE AGAINST WARFARE 
PICASSO SHOWS UNIVERSAL HUMAN SUFFERING BUT THE FLAVOUR OF SPAIN IS UNMISTAKEABLE 
THE IMAGERY OF THE BULLFIGHT 
THE BULL STANDS FOR FRANCO AND HIS FORCES 
THE SUFFERING HORSE THE PEOPLE OF SPAIN 
AND THESE IMAGES SOME OF THEM THE HORSE THE BULL THE WEEPING WOMAN ARE VERY PERSONAL FOR PICASSO 
THESE ARE IMAGES HE'D BEEN USING FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS 
BUT HERE IN THIS PAINTING VERY BRAVELY HE USED THOSE IMAGES TO MAKE MAYBE DIFFERENT POINTS 
POINTS ABOUT WAR AND VIOLENCE 
IT'S THIS FANTASTIC SORT OF TREMBLING BALANCE BETWEEN POLITICAL STATEMENT AND PERSONAL STATEMENT 
THAT MAKES THIS PAINTING SUCH A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS 
PAINTED IN PARIS PICASSO RULED THAT GUERNICA SHOULD ONLY BE RETURNED TO SPAIN 
HIS SPIRITUAL HOME AFTER THE COUNTRY HAD EMBRACED DEMOCRACY 
IT HUNG IN NEW YORK UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE 
A PAINTING IN EXILE 
NOW IT HANGS HERE IN THE MUSEO REINA SOFIA 
A WARNING TO SPAIN AND EVERY COUNTRY AT RISK OF TYRANNY 
IT RETAINS HUGE CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE FOR MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD 
IT HAS BECOME THE SINGLE IMAGE AGAINST THE HORRORS OF WAR 
OF VIOLENCE OF MILITARY REGIMES 
INDEED SO POWERFUL IS THE IMAGE 
THAT A COPY OF THIS PAINTING HANGING IN THE UNITED NATIONS HAD TO BE VEILED COVERED 
WHEN COLIN POWELL IN TWO THOUSAND THREE ANNOUNCED AMERICA'S INTENTIONS TO ATTACK IRAQ 
THIS IMAGE WAS SEEN AS INTOLERABLE AT THE TIME 
THIS REALLY IS THE IMAGE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
FROM MADRID I HEAD SOUTH ON THE JOURNEY BACK INTO SPAIN'S HISTORY 
IT FEELS LIKE I'M IN MOROCCO 
IN FACT I'M IN SPAIN 
HERE IN GRANADA I'M REMINDED OF EUROPE'S ISLAMIC HISTORY 
OF A MUSLIM SPAIN THAT MIGHT HAVE SURVIVED AND EVEN SPREAD FURTHER NORTH 
I'VE COME TO SEE THE GREATEST AND BEST PRESERVED COMPLEX OF PALACES IN ISLAMIC HISTORY THE ALHAMBRA 
THE ALHAMBRA WAS BUILT OVER SEVERAL CENTURIES BY THE MOORISH DYNASTIES 
MUSLIM SULTANS WHO RULED SOUTHERN SPAIN FROM SEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN TO ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY ONE 
FOR THE TIMES THEIR RULE WAS ENLIGHTENED AND EVEN TOLERANT 
MUSLIMS CHRISTIANS AND JEWS LIVED PEACEFULLY TOGETHER 
BUT EVEN AS THIS GREAT COMPLEX OF BUILDINGS WAS BEING COMPLETED ISLAM WAS BEING SQUEEZED OUT OF SPAIN 
BY CHRISTIAN MONARCHS FROM THE NORTH DETERMINED TO CONVERT EVERYONE TO THEIR FAITH 
I'VE JUST ENTERED THE COMARES PALACE 
THIS IS THE FIRST ANTEROOM HERE 
PEOPLE COMING FOR AN AUDIENCE WITH THE SULTAN WOULD WAIT NO DOUBT TREMBLING AND IN FEAR 
EVENTUALLY THEY'D BE CALLED THEIR TURN HAD COME TO CONFRONT THE GREAT MAN 
PERHAPS THEY'RE HERE CHARGED WITH SOME CRIME 
THEY GO THROUGH THIS DOOR 
THE SULTAN WOULD BE SITTING OVER HERE 
ON HIS THRONE 
THE PEOPLE WHO'D COME TO SEE HIM DOWN BELOW 
THIS DOOR ON THE RIGHT LEADS INTO THE HEART OF THE PALACE 
ONLY THOSE PEOPLE OF HIGH STATUS OF GRANDEUR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO PENETRATE BEYOND THIS POINT 
ORDINARY PEOPLE KEPT BACK 
THE BEAUTY OF THE ALHAMBRA IS EXTRAORDINARY 
THE EXQUISITE TILE WORK 
KORANIC INSCRIPTIONS 
THIS PLAYFUL USE OF WATER AND LIGHT 
THIS IS THE COURT OF THE FOUNTAIN OF THE LIONS 
ONE OF THE GREAT EXAMPLES OF ISLAMIC ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN 
THE FOUNTAIN'S BASED ON THE FOUNTAIN THE BIBLE TELLS US STANDS OUTSIDE SOLOMON'S TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM 
AND THE DIVISION OF THIS COURT INTO FOUR AREAS 
DIVIDED BY FOUR STRIPS OF WATER THEY REPRESENT PARADISE AS DESCRIBED IN THE BIBLE 
ONLY THOSE OF GREAT POWER IN THE LAND WOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENTER THIS PARADISE ON EARTH 
THIS IS THE FOCUS OF THE FORMAL ROOMS OF THE PALACE 
THE HALL OF THE AMBASSADORS 
HERE THE SULTAN WOULD HAVE RECEIVED MEN WITH DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS TO HIS COURT 
AN INCREDIBLE SPACE THIS BECAUSE IT IS 
FROM THE POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ROOMS IN THE WORLD 
HERE LATE IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY ONE THE LAST MUSLIM RULER IN SPAIN 
SAT IN AN ALCOVE OVER THERE 
AND SIGNED AWAY HIS KINGDOM 
HE'S BEEN OVERCOME BY THE CATHOLIC MONARCHS FERDINAND AND ISABELLA 
HE AGREED TO GO INTO EXILE AND GIVE UP HIS LAND 
SO AFTER NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS THE LAST ISLAMIC KINGDOM IN WESTERN EUROPE WAS OVER 
AN ERA HAD CERTAINLY COME TO A MOST DRAMATIC END 
IT'S MIND BOGGLING TO SPECULATE ON WHAT THE LOSS OF SPAIN MEANT TO ISLAM 
SPAIN WAS A JEWEL OF THE MUSLIM WORLD 
THE LOSS OF SPAIN IMPLIED THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH ISLAM 
HOW COULD GOD LET THIS LAND OF THE FAITHFUL BE TAKEN AWAY 
PARTICULARLY WHEN THE PEOPLE DOING THE TAKING WERE RUTHLESS FANATICS 
AND ALSO THE LOSS OF SPAIN HAS MEANT THAT ISLAM 
HAS BEEN DIVIDED FROM WESTERN EUROPE EVER SINCE 
AND THE RESULTS OF THAT ARE VERY TERRIBLE 
INDEED WE ARE LIVING WITH THOSE CONSEQUENCES NOW 
AND IT'S WORTH REFLECTING THAT BARELY HAD THE SULTAN LEFT BEFORE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS 
ARRIVED AT THE ALHAMBRA SEEKING FINANCE FOR HIS TRIP THAT WOULD DISCOVER THE AMERICAS 
IT MAY BE FANCIFUL BUT HAD COLUMBUS BEEN JUST A FEW MONTHS EARLIER 
MAYBE HE WOULD HAVE CROSSED THE ATLANTIC IN THE NAME OF ISLAM 
I LEAVE SPAIN FOR FRANCE AND ONE OF THE GREATEST RELIGIOUS BUILDINGS IN EUROPE 
CHARTRES CATHEDRAL IS NOT A GREAT RELIGIOUS TREASURE BECAUSE IT'S CHRISTIAN 
TO ME THIS MONUMENTAL BUILDING EMBRACES MUCH MUCH MORE 
THIS IS THIRTEENTH CENTURY GOTHIC 
THE MEDIEVAL LANGUAGE OF CHRISTIANITY AT ITS BEST 
BUT I'M NOT JUST HERE TO CELEBRATE THE ARCHITECTURE OR ANY ONE RELIGION 
I'M HERE TO SHARE IN CENTURIES OF MAN'S SEARCH FOR ENLIGHTENMENT 
AND I MUST SAY I FEEL RATHER LIKE A PILGRIM MYSELF 
HAVING BEEN TRAVELLING FOR FIVE MONTHS 
THE QUESTION THOUGH IS WILL I FIND A SORT OF SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT HERE 
THAT OTHER PILGRIMS HAVE FOUND IN THE PAST 
INCREDIBLE 
YOU CAN SEE THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE 
IMAGINE PILGRIMS COMING HERE HUMBLE PEOPLE 
THEY'VE SEEN NOTHING LIKE THIS IN THEIR LIVES BEFORE 
THE SCALE THE GLORY OF THIS PLACE 
THE BIBLE ACTED AS A DESIGN GUIDE FOR THE CREATION OF GREAT CHURCHES LIKE THIS 
IT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE UNSEEN WORLD 
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SEEN 
THAT THE SPIRITUAL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MATERIAL 
SO IN A GREAT CHURCH A GREAT CATHEDRAL 
IT'S THE SPACES DEFINED BY THE WALLS THAT ARE MOST POWERFUL 
WHERE GOD RESIDES 
AND THEN THERE'S LIGHT 
GOD IS LIGHT 
SO THE LIGHT FLOODING IN HERE 
MANIPULATED BY THE COLOURED GLASS IS IN ITSELF SACRED HOLY 
WITHOUT NECESSARILY REALISING IT PILGRIMS CAME HERE TO WORSHIP AN OBJECT 
THAT LONG BEFORE CHRISTIANITY SINCE THE BIRTH OF MANKIND HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF HUMAN DEVOTION 
THE SUN 
ALL ROUND THE WORLD I'VE SEEN THE SUN VENERATED 
IN EGYPT IN ANCIENT PERSIA 
AND I'VE SEEN THE SAME VENERATION FOR THE SUN IN EUROPE 
INDEED IN THIS GREAT CHRISTIAN CHURCH 
HERE BEFORE ME A LITTLE BRASS PIN 
EVERY YEAR ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF JUNE SUMMER SOLSTICE AT MIDDAY 
A RAY OF LIGHT ENTERS THIS CHURCH THROUGH A HOLE UP THERE ON THE LEFT 
AND THAT RAY OF LIGHT EXACTLY STRIKES THIS BRASS PIN 
AND I SHOULD SAY THE HOLE IN THE WINDOW SHOWS AN IMAGE OF SAINT APOLLINAIRE 
APOLLO THE SUN GOD 
SO ONE SEES HERE CONTINUATION OF AN ANCIENT PAGAN TRADITION 
A TRADITION FOR WORSHIPPING NATURE 
WORSHIPPING NATURE IN THE PERSON OF THE SUN 
THE MORE I LOOK AROUND THE MORE I SEE IMAGES THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY CHRISTIAN 
STONE CARVINGS ON THE DOORS DEPICT SIGNS FROM THE ZODIAC 
OTHERS SIMPLY SHOW THE WORLD OF MAN 
A HUGE BEETLE WITH A HUMAN HEAD REMINDS ME OF AN EGYPTIAN SCARAB 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CATHEDRAL IS A MARBLE LABYRINTH 
WHICH HAS NO CHRISTIAN ORIGINS AT ALL 
PILGRIMS IN THE MIDDLE AGES WOULD STAND HERE AND THEN WALK THE LABYRINTH 
TO DO THIS THEY WOULD TAKE THEIR SHOES OFF 
AS IN A MOSQUE SO THE SHOES GO OFF 
AND I ENTER THE LABYRINTH 
WHICH FOR ME 
WHEN I REACH ITS CENTRE REPRESENTS THE END OF MY JOURNEY 
THE END OF MY PILGRIMAGE AROUND THE WORLD LOOKING AT THE GREAT TREASURES THAT MAN HAS CREATED 
AS WITH SO MANY OF MY TREASURES 
CHARTRES IS A MONUMENT TO HUMANITY'S NEED TO INTERACT WITH A DIVINE PRESENCE 
A PRESENCE WE SENSE BUT CANNOT SEE 
THROUGH THE CENTURIES DIFFERENT CIVILISATIONS 
UNKNOWN TO ONE ANOTHER HAVE CREATED BUILDINGS TO WORSHIP THIS MIGHTY PRESENCE 
THEY FILL THESE BUILDINGS WITH OBJECTS IN AN ATTEMPT TO PERSONIFY AND HONOUR IT 
I'VE HEARD SO MANY DIFFERENT VOICES ALL SPEAKING THE SAME LANGUAGE 
WELL I'VE REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE LABYRINTH 
AND WHAT DO I FEEL 
HAVING TRAVELLED THE WORLD I'VE BEEN AWARE OF MANY OTHER RELIGIONS 
SOCIAL CONCERNS SACRED CONCERNS 
I'VE SEEN THOSE REFLECTED IN THE FABRIC THE DETAIL OF THIS GREAT CHURCH 
IT'S A FUSION 
THERE IS A UNIVERSAL RELIGION 
THAT MANKIND IS BIGGER THAN ONE RELIGION AND ALL RELIGIONS ARE 
IN THEIR ESSENTIAL PARTS RELATED ALL QUESTING THE SAME THING AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHY WE ARE HERE 
WHERE IS MANKIND GOING 
AND SO THIS GREAT CATHEDRAL I DO SEE IN A FRESH LIGHT 
THE MARRIAGE OF ALL THAT IS MARVELLOUS IN MANKIND AND IN THE WORLD 
THAT AS I STAND HERE 
WHERE THESE MILLIONS OF PILGRIMS HAVE STOOD THEY'VE HAD ENLIGHTENMENT 
I FEEL I ALSO 
HAVE GAINED ENLIGHTENMENT 
THAT THAT AND THAT 
AND THAT'S MY BLESSING 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
CERTAINLY ENDING THE JOURNEY IN SOME STYLE 
UM GETTING THE FERRY TOMORROW FROM CALAIS TO DOVER 
THIS CHARMING HOTEL I'VE BEEN FOUND IS UM 
ABOUT FORTY K. M. FROM CALAIS AND UM 
NOT MUCH BY WAY OF STAFF TO HELP 
IT'S GONE INCREDIBLE 
AH NO HERE WE GO 
THE HOTEL 
UM CLAIMS TO BE DECORATED IN THE ENGLISH STYLE 
WHICH SEEMS TO ME LEAVING A FEW OLD RIDING BOOTS AROUND THE PLACE 
INCREDIBLE REALLY UM 
FIVE MONTHS OF HOTELS THIS IS MY LAST ONE 
AH THERE YOU GO LOOK 
HUNTING SEASON 
CLEARLY THE ENGLISH STYLE 
WHAT DO WE HAVE OH I SAY 
SPLENDID 
AND I FEEL SITTING HERE WITH MY CHAMPAGNE MY LITTLE PLASTIC GLASS 
IN THIS ROOM DECORATED IN THE ENGLISH STYLE 
THAT I'M ENTERING BACK INTO THE REAL WORLD 
GOD HELP ME 
M. M. M. LOVELY 
THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER 
AN IMAGE THAT FOR CENTURIES HAS GREETED RETURNING TRAVELLERS HOME 
BUT HOME WILL SEEM A VERY SMALL PLACE FOR ME AT LEAST FOR A WHILE 
IT'S WORRYING WILL I FIT IN AGAIN 
REJOIN THE RAT RACE 
I'VE SEEN THE REMAINS OF GREAT CIVILISATIONS' RISE AND FALL 
STAGGERING EVIDENCE OF MANKIND'S GREAT POWER TO CREATE 
BUT WHAT'S CLEAR TOO LOOKING AT THESE MONUMENTS IS THAT IF THEY'RE TO SURVIVE 
TO SURVIVE THE DESTRUCTIVE POWERS OF MAN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THEM
