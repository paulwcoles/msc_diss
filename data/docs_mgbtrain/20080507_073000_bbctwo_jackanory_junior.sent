THIS IS ME MIRA MORRIS 
AND THIS IS MISS PORTER MY TEACHER 
SHE LOOKS QUITE ORDINARY DOESN'T SHE 
BUT SHE'S NOT NOT A BIT OF IT

BUT WATCH OUT SOMETIMES SHE CAN BE A BIT OF A DRAGON 
FOR SOME REASON HANNAH JOSIE AND NICOLE AND ALL THE OTHERS AROUND ME 
BURST OUT LAUGHING 
AH WHAT'S SO FUNNY MISS PORTER CALLED ACROSS THE CLASSROOM 
NOTHING THE LAUGHTER STOPPED AT ONCE 
HANNAH JOSIE NICOLE AND I SAT AT OUR TABLE 
AS THE MID MORNING BELL SOUNDED 
YIPPEE IT WAS TIME TO GET OUT OUR BREAK BOXES AND I WAS STARVING 
OH NO HANNAH EXCLAIMED YOU'VE GOT CRISPS 
HIDE THEM HIDE THEM JOSIE URGED 
WHAT'S THE MATTER I ASKED BUT I DIDN'T GET ANY FURTHER 
MISS PORTER SUDDENLY SPRANG TO HER FEET EYES WIDE AND STARING 
JOSIE TRIED TO SNATCH MY CRISPS BUT I SNATCHED THEM BACK 
EXCUSE ME I SAID IF YOU WANT A CRISP ASK FIRST 
I DON'T WANT THEM BUT THE MONSTER CRISP GUZZLER DOES JOSIE TOLD ME 
THE WHO ME MISS PORTER APPEARED FROM NOWHERE 
TO SQUAT DOWN AT MY CHAIR A LITTLE NICKNAME MY CLASS HAS FOR ME 
THEY CALL ME THAT BECAUSE I LOVE CRISPS SO MUCH 
THE WHOLE CLASS GASPED IN HORROR 
YOU DON'T MIND IF I HAVE ONE CRISP DO YOU MIRA ASKED MISS PORTER 
I SHOOK MY HEAD SLOWLY 
NO MISS PORTER 
I REALLY AM A MONSTER CRISP GUZZLER I'M AFRAID 
LAUGHED MISS PORTER AND SHE POPPED THE CRISPS INTO HER MOUTH 
AND THEN IT HAPPENED 
NOT JUST HER FACE BUT HER WHOLE BODY BEGAN TO CHANGE 
SHE GREW CRINKLY AND WRINKLY AND SHE STARTED SPROUTING SCALES 
ALL OVER HER ARMS AND HER LEGS AND HER FACE 
HER EARS GREW UP AND HER NOSE GREW OUT AND HER TEETH GREW DOWN 
AND ENORMOUS WINGS APPEARED FROM NOWHERE 
AND SHE HAD THE LONGEST TAIL I'VE EVER SEEN ON ANY CREATURE 
DELICIOUS SHE LICKED HER LIPS 
CAN I HAVE A COUPLE MORE 
I WAS STARING SO HARD THAT MY EYES WERE BEGINNING TO HURT 
MISS PORTER WASN'T A WOMAN ANY MORE 
MY TEACHER HAD TURNED INTO A DRAGON 
MIRA WE WARNED YOU NOT TO GIVE HER ANY CRISPS NICOLE SNAPPED 
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME MISS PORTER EATS THEM 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER TO SCREAM OR BURST OUT LAUGHING 
I PULLED MY CHAIR AWAY FROM MISS PORTER THE DRAGON 
I HARDLY DARED TO BREATHE 
SUPPOSE THAT WHEN SHE WAS A DRAGON SHE TURNED INTO A GIRL EATER 
IT'S O. K. MIRA I WON'T HURT YOU I PROMISE MISS PORTER SAID 
I CAN'T HELP BEING A DRAGON 
YOU WOULDN'T BE ONE IF YOU STOPPED EATING CRISPS HANNAH POINTED OUT 
H. H. HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO STAY A DRAGON MISS PORTER I ASKED 
MISS PORTER SHRUGGED HER DRAGON SHOULDERS NO IDEA 
IT MIGHT BE FIVE MINUTES IT MIGHT BE FIVE HOURS 
I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING 
MISS PORTER HIDE THE HEADMISTRESS IS COMING YELLED BARRY 
OH DEAR IF MRS. SPRAT CATCHES ME LIKE THIS SHE WILL SACK ME 
MISS PORTER LOOKED AROUND DESPERATELY FOR SOMEWHERE TO HIDE 
BARRY HURRIED BACK TO HIS DESK ONLY JUST IN TIME 
THE DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN AND THERE STOOD MRS. SPRAT 
WHERE'S MISS PORTER SHE ASKED NO ONE IN PARTICULAR 
ERR SHE JUST STEPPED OUT FOR A MOMENT HANNAH REPLIED 
STEPPED OUT WHERE ASKED THE HEADMISTRESS 
ER SHE DIDN'T SAY HANNAH RUSHED ON SORRY 
I HAD TO FIGHT TO LOOK AT MRS. SPRAT AND NOT WHAT WAS GOING ON ABOVE HER 
MISS PORTER WAS FLOATING RIGHT ABOVE HER HEAD 
SHE PLACED ONE FINGER OVER HER SCALY LIPS 
AND SIGNALLED TO US NOT TO GIVE THE GAME AWAY 
SHE SHOULDN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE I'LL GO AND FIND HER IMMEDIATELY 
IF SHE COMES BACK TELL HER I WANT TO SEE HER SAID MRS. SPRAT 
WE ALL NODDED MRS. SPRAT LEFT THE CLASSROOM 
MISS PORTER FLOATED DOWN HER TAIL UNCURLING 
THAT WAS TOO CLOSE THANKS FOR NOT GIVING THE GAME AWAY SHE BEGAN 
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT 
OH CLASS COULD YOU TELL 
MRS. SPRAT ENTERED THE ROOM AND STARED AT MISS PORTER THE DRAGON 
I HELD MY BREATH WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NOW 
I WARNED YOU WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU TURNED INTO A DRAGON AGAIN 
SAID MRS. SPRAT YOU WILL WORK UNTIL I FIND SOMEONE TO REPLACE YOU 
YOU WILL NO LONGER BE WELCOME AT MY SCHOOL YOU ARE DISMISSED 
MRS. SPRAT SLAMMED OUT OF THE CLASSROOM 
WE ALL STARED IN HORROR 
JUST LIKE THAT MISS PORTER HAD LOST HER JOB 
AND I FELT WORSE THAN ANYONE BECAUSE IT WAS ALL MY FAULT 
THE REST OF THE WEEK FLEW BY AND WE DIDN'T WANT IT TO 
EVEN THE PROSPECT OF A TRIP TO THE SEASIDE DIDN'T CHEER US UP 
EVERYBODY WAS VERY AWARE THAT FRIDAY WAS OUR LAST DAY WITH MISS PORTER 
WE GOT A SURPRISE WHEN WE CLIMBED INTO THE COACH ON FRIDAY MORNING 
MRS. SPRAT THE HEADMISTRESS WAS OUR DRIVER 
I'M COMING TO MAKE SURE NONE OF YOU SHE GLARED AT MISS PORTER 
NONE OF YOU GETS UP TO ANY MISCHIEF WITH THAT WE SET OFF 
WHEN WE GOT THERE THE BEACH AND THE SEA COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE PERFECT 
BUT I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE MOPING AROUND 
CHEER UP CLASS MISS PORTER TRIED HER BEST TO MAKE US SMILE 
SHE PULLED SILLY FACES AND TRIED TO JUGGLE WITH SHELLS AND SEAWEED 
WE DID LAUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN A. 
LONG SMELLY PIECE OF SEAWEED FELL ON MISS PORTER'S HEAD 
BUT IT DIDN'T LAST LONG THIS WAS OUR VERY LAST DAY WITH OUR TEACHER 
I WAS GOING TO MISS HER 
IF ONLY WE COULD CHANGE MRS. SPRAT'S MIND I SAID TO MY NEW FRIENDS 
WE WALKED ALONG THE BEACH LOOKING IN ROCK POOLS AND WATCHING CRABS 
WE ATE OUR LUNCH AND MADE SANDCASTLES 
UNTIL ALL TOO SOON IT WAS TIME TO GO HOME 
BACK IN THE COACH I LOOKED AROUND FOR MY LUNCHBOX 
OH NO MISS PORTER I'VE LEFT MY LUNCHBOX OVER BY THE ROCK POOL 
I CAN SEE IT FROM HERE CAN I GO AND GET IT PLEASE 
HURRY UP SAID MISS PORTER GO STRAIGHT THERE AND STRAIGHT BACK 
I COULD SEE THE WHITE FOAMY CREST OF THE SEA BREAKING ON THE BEACH 
I RAN TO THE ROCK POOL WHERE I'D LEFT MY BOX 
IT WASN'T THERE I COULD SEE A BIG SEAGULL DRAGGING IT ALONG THE BEACH 
THAT'S MINE I CRIED AND STARTED RUNNING AFTER IT 
WHEN AT LAST I REACHED IT I PICKED IT UP AND DUSTED OFF THE SAND 
THE TIDE WHICH HAD SEEMED SO GENTLE WAS GALLOPING UP THE BEACH 
AND IT WAS ONLY A FEW METRES AWAY 
I TURNED AND RAN 
JUMPING ON TO ONE ROCK THEN THE NEXT ONE HIGHER UP THEN THE NEXT 
THE TIDE CRASHED ON UP THE BEACH I SCREAMED AGAIN 
ALL AROUND ME THE WATER WAS GETTING HIGHER AND HIGHER 
IN THE DISTANCE I COULD SEE MY CLASSMATES POINTING AT ME 
MISS PORTER JUMPED OUT OF THE COACH AND CAME RACING TOWARDS ME 
MRS. SPRAT AND THE OTHERS SPRINTED OUT OF THE COACH BEHIND HER 
HELP SOMEONE HELP I YELLED 
I'LL GET HER SAID MRS. SPRAT AND SHE PULLED OFF HER JACKET AND SHOES 
MISS PORTER PULLED HER BACK THE TIDE IS TOO FAST 
AND THE CURRENT IS TOO STRONG YOU'D BE SWEPT AWAY 
DO SOMETHING HELP I SCREAMED 
THE WATER WAS LASHING HIGHER UP THE ROCKS 
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY CRISPS MISS PORTER CALLED OUT SUDDENLY 
NO EVERYONE SHOOK THEIR HEADS 
I'LL GET YOU SOME MRS. SPRAT SAID 
SHE LIFTED UP HER FLOWERY SKIRT AND SPRINTED TOWARDS THE GIFT SHOP 
AND ALL THE TIME THE WATER AROUND ME WAS RISING AND RISING AND RISING 
ONLY A COUPLE MORE CENTIMETRES AND IT WOULD REACH ME 
MRS. SPRAT RACED BACK WITH HER ARMS FULL OF CRISPS 
MISS PORTER GRABBED THE NEAREST BAG AND TORE IT OPEN 
TILTING HER HEAD BACK SHE LET THE CRISPS FALL INTO HER MOUTH 
HURRY I SHOUTED THE SEA CHARGED AGAINST THE ROCKS I WAS STANDING ON 
SPRAYING UP ONTO MY SOCKS AND SKIRT 
I WATCHED MISS PORTER'S SHOULDERS BEGIN TO HEAVE UP AND DOWN 
SHE RUBBED HER GROWING NOSE WINGS SPROUTED OUT OF HER BACK 
THE LONGEST TAIL OF ANY ANIMAL ANYWHERE WHIPPED UP AND DOWN 
QUICK I YELLED WASTING NO MORE TIME 
MISS PORTER FLEW OVER AND LOWERED HER TAIL 
MIRA GRAB HOLD QUICK SHE SAID 
SHE DIDN'T NEED TO TELL ME TWICE I GRABBED HOLD OF HER TAIL 
JUST IN TIME TOO THE TIDE CRASHED OVER WHERE I'D BEEN STANDING 
ONLY A SECOND BEFORE I HELD ON TIGHT AS WE FLEW OVER THE SEA 
MISS PORTER'S TAIL WAS VERY WARM BUT SCALY AND ROUGH 
WHICH WAS JUST AS WELL OR I'D HAVE SLID OFF INTO THE SEA BELOW 
MISS PORTER FLEW UP THE BEACH TO WHERE IT WAS SAFE 
SHE MADE SURE MY FEET WERE ON THE GROUND BEFORE SHE LANDED 
HOORAY FOR MISS PORTER THE CLASS CHEERED 
MRS. SPRAT WASN'T MISS PORTER WONDERFUL ASKED HANNAH HOPEFULLY 
YEAH YEAH SHE WAS 
MRS. SPRAT SMILED AT HANNAH BEFORE TURNING TO MISS PORTER 
PERHAPS I WAS RATHER TOO HASTY IN TELLING YOU TO LEAVE 
YOU MAY HAVE YOUR JOB BACK BUT ONLY IF YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF 
NO MORE TURNING INTO A DRAGON DURING SCHOOL HOURS 
NO MORE CRISPS PROMISE I PROMISE SAID MISS PORTER 
ADDING UNDER HER BREATH I PROMISE I'LL TRY 
MISS PORTER CAN I HAVE A RIDE PLEASE BARRY PLEADED 
I DON'T THINK MRS. SPRAT WOULD BE TOO HAPPY ABOUT THAT SAID MRS. PORTER 
WELL WE'VE GOT ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE WE HAVE TO SET OFF 
SO WHY NOT MRS. SPRAT SURPRISED US ALL BY SAYING 
MISS PORTER GAVE EVERYONE IN THE CLASS A RIDE ON HER BACK 
OVER THE SEA AND ALONG THE BEACH UNTIL THE CRISPS WORE OFF 
AND SHE TURNED BACK INTO OUR TEACHER 
WHEN WE GOT BACK TO THE COACH WE'D HAD THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME EVER 
WE SANG SONGS ALL THE WAY HOME 
EVEN MRS. SPRAT JOINED IN IT WAS TERRIFIC 
I DIDN'T MIND GETTING WET IF MISS PORTER COULD STILL BE OUR TEACHER 
MISS PORTER HAD A SECRET THAT ONLY THE OTHERS IN MY CLASS 
AND THE HEADMISTRESS KNEW AND THAT WAS THE WAY IT WAS GOING TO STAY 
SO WATCH OUT FOR CRISP GUZZLING TEACHERS WON'T YOU 
SEE YOU LATER
