IN THIS PROGRAMME I'M VISITING DIFFERENT PLACES 
TO DO DIFFERENT WRITING 
ALL TO DO WITH THE WEATHER 
HERE I AM ON THE CARIBBEAN ISLAND GRENADA AND IT'S POURING WITH RAIN 
I SUPPOSE THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO WHEN IT'S RAINING LIKE THIS 
EXCEPT MAYBE LOOK AT IT OR TAKE A PICTURE OF IT 
OR PERHAPS WE COULD MEASURE IT 
ONE THING WE CAN DO IS WRITE ABOUT IT 
SO HOW DO WE DESCRIBE IN WORDS WHAT WE SEE FROM UP HERE 
HOW DO WE DESCRIBE THE WEATHER 
FIRST WHAT DO WE SEE 
WELL THERE'S THE RAIN AND THE TREES 
I CAN SEE THE LEAVES ON THE TROPICAL PLANTS 
I CAN SEE A HOUSE 
WITH A TIN ROOF 
I CAN SEE A GUTTER FULL OF RAINWATER 
I CAN SEE A PUDDLE ON THE PAVEMENT 
I CAN SEE THE RAIN ON THE ROAD 
WHAT DO WE HEAR 
I CAN HEAR DRIPPING 
AND DRIBBLING 
I CAN HEAR POURING 
AND HAMMERING 
I CAN HEAR GUSHING AND GURGLING 
I'VE MANAGED TO JOT DOWN SOME REALLY USEFUL WORDS 
BUT THEY NEED MORE WORK TO TURN THEM INTO A DESCRIPTION HAVE A GO 
THIS IS WHAT I CAME UP WITH 
FROM THE VERANDA OF THE HOUSE 
NEXT TIME YOU'RE CAUGHT IN THE RAIN DON'T JUST LOOK AT IT 
WRITE ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN SEE 
NEXT SOME DIFFERENT WEATHER FOR YOU TO DESCRIBE IN SNOWY LAPLAND 
WITH SOME WORDS TO HELP YOU 
IT'S BACK TO TROPICAL GRENADA FOR MY NEXT TASK 
TO WRITE ABOUT A DAY IN THE LIFE 
THIS IS TEDDY VICTOR AND HE'S A NUTMEG FARMER 
TEDDY'S LIFE IS SO DIFFERENT FROM MINE I'M GOING TO WRITE ABOUT IT 
O. K. SO IT'S ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND TEDDY'S PICKING NUTMEGS 
THESE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS I SPOTTED DURING TEDDY'S DAY 
IT'S FIVE THIRTY A M. AND TEDDY AND HIS WIFE ARE HAVING BREAKFAST 
AT SEVEN A M. TEDDY DRIVES TO WORK 
HI 
IT'S FOUR A M. AND TEDDY VICTOR'S DAY STARTS 
IT'S EIGHT P. M. AND TEDDY'S DAY IS OVER AND HE'S RELAXING WITH HIS WIFE 
THAT'S COREEM 
SHE TAUGHT IN THE ISLAND THIS YEAR 
AFTER TEDDY HAS PICKED THE NUTMEGS 
HE HAS TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE RECEIVING STATION 
IF I WANT TO WRITE ABOUT TEDDY'S DAY SO IT MAKES SENSE 
I NEED TO PUT EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT ORDER 
THESE ARE THE THINGS 
I SAW TEDDY DOING DURING HIS DAY 
BUT WHAT HAPPENED FIRST WHAT HAPPENED LAST 
AND WHAT HAPPENED IN BETWEEN WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THAT'S BETTER 
HE GETS UP HAS HIS BREAKFAST 
DRIVES TO WORK HARVESTS NUTMEGS 
PREPARES THEM FOR THE FACTORY 
AND FINISHES THE DAY RELAXING WITH HIS WIFE 
THAT'S ALL IN THE RIGHT ORDER 
BUT IT'S STILL NOT A PROPER PIECE OF WRITING 
TO HELP US WRITE ABOUT THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN ORDER LIKE TEDDY'S DAY 
THERE ARE SPECIAL WORDS AND PHRASES WE CAN USE 
YOU HAVE A GO AT USING THEM 
HOW ABOUT THIS 
FROM THE ISLAND OF GRENADA TO SOUTHERN SPAIN 
SO YOU CAN WRITE ABOUT A DAY WITH ANTONIO THE FISHERMAN 
IT'S ALREADY IN THE RIGHT ORDER 
NO FISH TODAY FOR ANTONIO 
FOR MY NEXT TASK I'M GOING TO WRITE SOME INSTRUCTIONS 
THIS IS DEATH VALLEY AND I'M SET TO GO INTO THE DESERT 
BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE DRIEST PLACES IN THE WORLD 
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE SAFE 
I'VE GOT ALL THIS KIT SO I SHOULD BE O. K. 
BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING I'VE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING YES YOU HAVE 
I'M DALE HOWSLEY ONE OF THE PARK RANGERS HERE ANDY NICE TO SEE YOU 
YOU NEED SOME MORE WATER FIRSTLY 
AND YOU NEED TO CHECK THIS VEHICLE BEFORE YOU GO 
MAKE SURE IT HAS PLENTY FUEL AND COOLANT 
A GOOD SPARE TYRE AND TOOLS 
LAST BUT NOT LEAST BE SURE NOT TO TOUCH ANY OF THE RATTLESNAKES 
MOUTHS 
I'D BETTER WRITE THAT DOWN AS A LIST OF INSTRUCTIONS 
THINGS TO DO BEFORE GOING INTO THE DESERT 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET INSTRUCTIONS IN THE RIGHT ORDER SO LET'S SEE 
I THINK PLANNING THE ROUTE COMES FIRST 
THEN MAKING SURE I'VE GOT THE RIGHT CLOTHES FOR THE HOT WEATHER 
I THINK CHECKING THE CAR'S O. K. COMES NEXT 
THEN I NEED TO TAKE PLENTY OF DRINKING WATER FOR THE TRIP 
HI HEADING OUT TO BADWATER I'LL BE BACK ABOUT THREE P. M. 
THEN I NEED TO TELL PEOPLE WHERE I'M GOING 
I'M READY BUT I'M SURE THE RANGER SAID SOMETHING ELSE 
THESE AIN'T PROPER INSTRUCTIONS UNTIL THEY TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO 
FOR THIS WE NEED THE ORDERING TENSE 
WHICH GIVES PEOPLE AN ORDER TO DO SOMETHING 
YOU HAVE A GO 
THIS IS MY VERSION 
HI HEADING OUT TO BADWATER 
BYE 
HERE THIS SHOULD BE USEFUL STAYING SAFE AND SOUND 
AH THESE SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS HAVE DONE THE JOB FOR US 
ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE HERE 
CARRY PLENTY OF WATER 
STAY ON THE ROADS DON'T DISTURB THE WILDLIFE 
ALL GOOD ADVICE IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO EXPLORE A PLACE LIKE THIS 
REMEMBER GOOD INSTRUCTIONS CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE 
I'M SURE THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE 
DON'T FORGET DON'T TOUCH THE RATTLESNAKES 
FOR MY FINAL PIECE OF WRITING 
I'M IN SOUTHERN SPAIN TO WRITE A BROCHURE 
THIS IS THE SPANISH HOLIDAY RESORT OF TORREMOLINOS 
THOUSANDS COME HERE TO ENJOY THE SUN AND THE SEA 
HOW WOULD YOU PERSUADE SOMEONE TO COME TO THIS PART OF SUNNY SPAIN 
FIRST LET'S SEE WHAT THERE IS THAT MAKES PEOPLE ENJOY COMING HERE 
WELL FOR A START 
THERE'S A NICE LONG BEACH FOR SUNBATHING 
THE SEA LOOKS NICE FOR SWIMMING 
THERE ARE SOME NICE HOTELS AND APARTMENTS 
THERE ARE NICE RESTAURANTS AND SHOPS 
AND LOTS OF NICE PEOPLE HELLO HOW ARE YOU 
AND THE WEATHER'S NICE AS WELL 
BUT THAT'S A LIST OF THINGS AND WE NEED MORE WORDS THAN JUST NICE 
TO MAKE TORREMOLINOS SOUND WORTH VISITING 
HOW ABOUT 
YOU HAVE A GO AT USING THESE DESCRIBING WORDS 
TO WRITE YOUR BROCHURE ABOUT TORREMOLINOS 
THIS IS WHAT I CAME UP WITH 
WELL I'M CERTAINLY PERSUADED BY THAT TIME TO ENJOY MYSELF
