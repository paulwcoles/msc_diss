REPORTS SAY NINE HUNDRED STUDENTS HAVE BEEN 
BURIED BY THE QUAKE WHICH HAVE LEFT 
OVER ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE DEAD 
GORDON BROWN'S PREMIERSHIP IS 
CALLED INTO QUESTION BY A SENIOR 
LABOUR BACKBENCHER 
I WOULD BE VERY 
SURPRISED IF HE IS STILL THE LEADER 
OF THE LABOUR PARTY 
POLICE INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JIMMY MIZEN SAY AN 
EYEWITNESS HAS COME FORWARD 
TURNING UP THE HEAT BRITISH GAS 
WARNS OF BILL HIKES AS WHOLESALE 
GAS PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE 
HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW THE 
NATIONAL TRUST HAS PLANS TO FIND 
OUT OUT SHOCKING NEW FIGURES ON THE NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY FIVE KILLED IN THE 
CAPITAL CAPITAL THE LATEST CAMPAIGN BY LONDON 
MOTHERS FOR MORE TOLERANCE OF 
BREAST FEEDING IN PUBLIC 
GOOD AFTERNOON IT'S FEARED UP TO 
NINE HUNDRED STUDENTS MAY BE BURIED IN THE 
RUBBLE OF THEIR SCHOOL AFTER 
POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE HIT SOUTH 
WESTERN CHINA THE QUAKE WITH A 
MAGNITUDE OF SEVENTY EIGHT STRUCK SICHUAN 
PROVINCE AND SENT TREMORS ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY AND TO OTHER PARTS OF 
EASTERN ASIA EARLY REPORTS SAY 
MANY PEOPLE ARE FEARED DEAD 
THE EARTHQUAKE WAS FELT BY OFFICE 
WORKERS IN TALL BUILDINGS MANY 
HUNDREDS OF KILOMETRES AWAY IN 
BEIJING 
THAT THE WIND OR WHAT BEIJING IT HAS TO BE AN EARTHQUAKE IT IS 
SO LONG 
SOME TOWER BLOCKS SWAYED 
FOR MORE THAN TWO MINUTES 
BUILDINGS WERE EVACUATED AND SOON 
THOUSANDS OF OFFICE WORKERS 
GATHERED ON THE STREETS 
WE WERE 
TONNE FIFTEENTH FLOOR AND THE BUILDING 
WE WERE ON THE FIFTEENTH FLOOR AND THE 
BUILDING STARTED SHAKING QUITE A 
LOT 
IT WAS CLEAR THAT A POWERFUL LOT EARTHQUAKE HAD OCCURRED ON THE 
EASTERN EDGE OF THE TIBETAN PLATEAU 
THE CLOSEST LARGE POPULATION CENTRE 
BEING HERE CHENGDU WITH TEN 
MILLION PEOPLE BECAUSE OF 
COMMUNICATIONS PROBLEMS IT TOOK 
SOME TIME FOR EVIDENCE TO EMERGE OF 
HOW MUCH IMPACT THE EARTHQUAKE HAS 
HAD THESE ARE THE LATEST PICTURES 
FROM CHENGDU SHOWING CASUALTIES 
BEING RECEIVED THERE ARE NOW 
WORRYING REPORTS OF LARGE NUMBERS 
OF STUDENTS TRAPPED AND ALSO OF 
ROWS OF HOUSES COLLAPSING NEAR THE 
EARTHQUAKE'S EPICENTRE THE 
EARTHQUAKE STRUCK DURING ONE OF THE 
BUSIEST PARTS OF THE WORKING AND 
SCHOOL DAY AND THERE WAS CONCERN 
FOR AREAS WHERE BUILDINGS ARE OLDER 
CHINA'S PRESIDENT HU JINTAO HAS 
CALLED FOR ALL OUT EFFORTS TO 
RESCUE VICTIMS AND TROOPS HAVE BEEN 
DISPATCHED HERE THE AUTHORITIES 
PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM RETURNING TO 
BUILDINGS FOR A TIME TO ALLOW ANY 
DAMAGE TO BE ASSESSED AND FOR FEAR 
OF FURTHER TREMORS THESE PEOPLE 
MAY BE SAFE BUT FEARS WILL 
INEVITABLY GROW FOR THOSE CLOSE TO 
THE EPICENTRE ITSELF 
LET'S GET AN UPDATE FROM OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IN BEIJING QUENTIN 
SOMERVILLE WHAT IS THE LATEST THE THE LATEST WE ARE HEARING IS NINE HUNDRED OF 
THOSE ARE SCHOOL CHILDREN TRAPPED 
AFTER THEIR HIGH SCHOOL COLLAPSED 
WE HAVE HAD A CONFIRMATION OF FOUR 
CHILDREN KILLED AT ANOTHER 
COLLAPSED SCHOOL A PRIMARY SCHOOL 
THIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL 
EARTHQUAKE TO HIT THIS PART OF 
CHINA IN OVER THIRTY YEARS SO POWERFUL 
WE FELT IT HERE IN BEIJING CHINA 
IS THROWING EVERYTHING IT HAS AT IT 
THE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY HAS 
BEEN DEPLOYED IN THE PAST HALF AN 
HOUR THE PRIME MINISTER WEN 
JIABAO HAS ARRIVED ON THE SCENE 
TOO WE ARE EXPECTING EVEN HIGHER 
CASUALTY FIGURES THIS IS A MAJOR 
EARTHQUAKE TO STRIKE THIS PART OF 
CHINA CHINA HERE IT'S BEEN ANOTHER DAY OF 
WRANGLING IN THE LABOUR PARTY RANKS 
THE PRIME MINISTER FACED MORE 
PERSONAL ATTACKS THIS MORNING THIS 
TIME FROM FORMER MINISTER FRANK 
FIELD HE SAID HE WOULD BE 
SURPRISED IF GORDON BROWN WAS IN 
CHARGE BY THE NEXT ELECTION AND HE 
MAY BE OUSTED BEFORE THE END OF THE 
YEAR YEAR HE'S PRIME MINISTER UNDER ATTACK 
ALL HE CAN DO IS GET ON WITH THE 
JOB SO TODAY A MAJOR SPEECH ABOUT 
CARE FOR THE ELDERLY MR. BROWN 
WANTS BIG SHAKE UP OF THE SYSTEM 
AND A NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT HOW TO 
PAY THE SOARING COSTS MEASURES MEASURES WHICH EXCEED IN SUPPORTING FRAIL 
PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES WILL HELP WE 
CAN AND MUST LOOK TO GIVE PEOPLE 
THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE SUPPORT TO 
SAVE FOR THEIR OLD AGE IN A WAY 
THAT ENSURES THEM AND PROTECTS THE 
HOUSES AND THEIR INHERITANCE ONE ONE OPTION IS TO FOLLOW SCOTLAND'S 
EXAMPLE WHERE THE ELDERLY ARE 
ENTITLED TO FREE PERSONAL CARE PAID 
OUT OF GENERAL TAXATION BUT IT WILL 
BE AT LEAST SIX MONTHS BEFORE MR. 
BROWN'S PLANS ARE FINALISED AND 
WHILE HE CONCENTRATES ON POLICY 
OTHERS HAVE A DIFFERENT AGENDA 
SOME ARE TRYING TO SELL THEIR 
AUTOBIOGRAPHIES AND STORIES ABOUT 
MR. BROWN'S HOT TEMPER AND PRICKLY 
CHARACTER GET THE BEST HEADLINES 
OTHERS ARE UNHELPFULLY PREDICTING 
HE WILL BE DITCHED AS LABOUR LEADER 
BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION 
WITH THIS 
BUDGET COMING UP WITH THE TEN P. CUT 
IN THE FIRST RATE OF TAX WHICH HAS 
CAUSED ANGER NOT OF THE LIKE I HAVE 
SEEN ON THE LABOUR BACKBENCHERS 
EVER BEFORE IF WE DON'T GET A 
SATISFACTORY DEAL I THINK THERE IS 
ENOUGH MEMBERS ON THE LABOUR 
BACKBENCHES WHO WILL WITH OTHERS 
BLOCK THE BUDGET GOING THROUGH AND 
THAT WILL MAKE HIS POSITION 
INTOLERABLE AT THAT STAGE MR. MR BROWN'S FRIENDS ACKNOWLEDGE THE 
KNIVES ARE OUT THEIR ARE URGING 
COLLEAGUES TO STOP THE CHARACTER 
ASSASSINATION 
GORDON IS A VERY ASSASSINATION STRONG PERSONALITY HE WILL PUT ALL 
THIS TO ONE SIDE HIS INTEREST IS 
NOT IN THIS TITTLE TATTLE THESE 
TRUE CONFESSIONS HE IS INTERESTED 
IN HOW DO WE GRAPPLE WITH THESE 
ISSUES LIKE REDUCING CRIME LIKE 
TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY 
AND SECURITY AND PENSIONS THAT IS 
WHAT HE IS IN POLITICS FOR DOWNING DOWNING STREET INSISTS MR. BROWN WON'T BE 
DISTRACTED FROM HIS JOB BUT HE 
FACES ANOTHER TEST WITH VOTERS NEXT 
WEEK IN THE CREWE BY ELECTION 
LET'S GET MORE FROM OUR POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE AS 
MUCH AS DOWNING STREET WOULD LIKE 
EVERYONE TO MOVE ON AND TALK ABOUT 
POLICY INITIATIVES AS WE HAVE 
HEARD THE HEADLINES STILL FOCUSING 
VERY MUCH ON THE PERSONAL AND THAT 
TEN P. TAX RATE HOW DAMAGING IS ALL 
OF THIS FOR GORDON BROWN 
WELL ALL 
THE MEMOIRS THAT CAME OUT OVER THE 
WEEKEND A LOT OF IT IS HISTORICAL 
IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS RESONANCE 
HERE IN WESTMINSTER SECONDLY 
FRANK FIELD IS ONE M. P. HE'S A 
MAVERICK THE VIEW AMONGST A LOT OF 
LABOUR M. P.'S IS THAT HE'S OVERREACHED 
HIMSELF HERE HE'S ALLOWED HIS 
CRITIQUE OF THE PRIME MINISTER TO 
MOVE FROM POLICY TO PERSONALITY AND 
AS A RESULT HE'S UNDERMINED HIS 
CASE THAT SAID I THINK THE 
CRITICISM COMES IN TWO FORMS ONE 
IS THE CHARACTER ASSASSINATION 
YESTERDAY JOHN PRESCOTT SAID THAT 
THE PRIME MINISTER WAS PRICKLY 
ANNOYING TODAY FRANK FIELD SAYS HE 
IS NOT HAPPY IN HIMSELF IF THAT 
HAS A RESONANCE WITH THE WIDER 
ELECTORATE THAT COULD BE DAMAGING 
THE SECOND DAMAGE IS SIMPLY THE 
FACT THAT ALL OF THIS STUFF CROWDS 
OUT ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT 
ANNOUNCEMENT 
WHAT CAN HE DO TO ANNOUNCEMENT TURN IT AROUND 
THE STRATEGY IS 
CLEAR THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
SPOKESMAN SAYS HE IS NOT GOING TO 
BE DISTRACTED HE WILL GET ON WITH 
THE ISSUES THAT MATTER TO HIM 
TODAY WE HAVE HAD THE SPEECH ON 
SOCIAL CARE ON WEDNESDAY WE WILL 
HAVE THE GOVERNMENT'S LATEST 
LEGISLATIVE PLANS WE HAVE MORE 
PROPOSALS LATER IN THE WEEK SO 
THEY WILL BOMBARD US WITH POLICY 
THE PROBLEM THE PRIME MINISTER HAS 
IS THERE ARE PEOPLE WITHIN THE 
LABOUR PARTY WHO THINK THEIR OWN 
AGENDA OUR THEIR OWN BOOKS ARE 
MORE IMPORTANT THAN PARTY UNITY AND 
AT THE MOMENT THAT IS MAKING IT 
VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
TO GET ITS MESSAGE ACROSS 
A VERY WELL LIKED GENTLE STUDENT 
WHO ALWAYS TRIED HIS BEST THE 
WORDS USED BY A HEAD TEACHER THIS 
MORNING TO DESCRIBE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD 
JIMMY MIZEN WHO WAS MURDERED IN 
SOUTH EAST LONDON ON SATURDAY 
MORNING EARLIER POLICE SAID AN 
EYEWITNESS HAS COME FORWARD BEN 
ANDO IS OUTSIDE THE TEENAGER'S 
SCHOOL SCHOOL YES THEY HAD ARRIVED THE 
YOUNGSTERS HERE FOR LEAVING MASS 
AS THEY PREPARED TO GO ON TO SIXTH 
FORM INSTEAD IT TURNED INTO 
SERVICE OF REMEMBRANCE FOR JIMMY 
MIZEN HIS FRIENDS FOUND THEMSELVES 
ASKING WHY HE DIED ACROSS THE 
SCENE FORENSIC OFFICERS AND SCENES 
OF CRIMES OFFICERS HAVE BEEN TRYING 
TO ESTABLISH HOW HE DIED 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS LAST DAY AT 
SCHOOL BUT FRIENDS OF JIMMY MIZEN 
WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING 
FORWARD TO THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS 
FOUND THEMSELVES MOURNING A FRIEND 
WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING 
FORWARD TO THE REST OF HIS LIFE 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JIMMY DIED AFTER AN 
ALTERCATION AT A BAKERY ON SATURDAY 
A LEAVERS' MASS BECAME SERVICE OF 
REMEMBRANCE ATTENDED BY HIS PARENTS 
WE HAVE SEEN ANOTHER SIDE TO JIMMY 
THAT WE DIDN'T APPRECIATE AND IT 
WAS RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES HE WAS A 
DEAR SWEET YOUNG MAN AND WE LOVED 
HIM DEARLY ON THE NIGHT OF HIS 
BIRTHDAY HE WAS GOING OUT WITH 
SOME FRIENDS WE CUDDLED HIM 
NOTHING UNUSUAL SAID WE LOVED HIM 
AND THAT IS GREAT THAT IS A GREAT 
MEMORY FOR ME 
POLICE ARE STILL 
TRYING TO ESTABLISH HOW JIMMY DIED 
AT THE BAKERY JUST A SHORT DISTANCE 
FROM HIS HOME IT WAS MID MORNING 
ON SATURDAY THAT JIMMY DECIDED TO 
BUY HIS FIRST LOTTERY TICKET AND 
MAYBE A SANDWICH FOR LUNCH HE 
WALKED THE THREE HUNDRED YARD DISTANCE FROM 
HIS HOME ON TO LEE HIGH STREET AND 
UP TO THE THREE COOKS BAKERY THAT 
IS WHERE JIMMY MET HIS BROTHER AND 
THEN WENT INSIDE TO BUY SOMETHING 
TO EAT JIMMY WAS CUT ON THE NECK 
BY BROKEN GLASS AFTER YOUTH RAN 
INTO THE BAKERY SMASHING CABINETS 
POLICE SAY THE YOUTH HAD EARLIER 
CHALLENGED JIMMY TO A FIGHT BUT HAD 
REFUSED 
THE POLICE HAVE HAD ONE REFUSED BIG LEAP FORWARD IN THAT A CRUCIAL 
WITNESS WHO WAS INSIDE THE BAKERY 
HAS COME FORWARD AND IS SPEAKING TO 
DETECTIVES LATER ON WE ARE HOPING 
POLICE WILL NOT ONLY GIVE US A 
BETTER DESCRIPTION OF THE YOUTH 
INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT BUT ALSO 
PERHAPS A BIT MORE OF A COMPLETE 
ACCOUNT OF HOW JIMMY CAME TO SUFFER 
THAT FATAL NECK INJURY 
MORE AID HAS FINALLY REACHED BURMA 
TODAY AFTER THE FIRST AMERICAN AID 
PLANE LANDED IN RANGOON NINE DAYS 
AFTER THE CYCLONE STRUCK IT'S 
TAKEN A WEEK OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
THE BURMESE MILITARY GOVERNMENT FOR 
THE FLIGHT TO GO AHEAD TWO MORE 
ARE SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW ONE AID 
AGENCY TOLD THE B. B. C. UP TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
PEOPLE ARE NOW GETTING HELP BUT 
THE UNITED NATIONS SPOKESMAN SAID 
THERE STILL AREN'T ENOUGH BOATS 
TRUCKS AND HELICOPTERS FOR THE 
SCALE OF RELIEF OPERATION NEEDED 
A SINGLE AMERICAN CARGO PLANE GETS 
READY TO LEAVE FOR RANGOON THIS 
MORNING LOADED WITH RELIEF 
SUPPLIES IT'S TAKEN DAYS OF 
NEGOTIATING TO GET THIS OFF THE 
GROUND AND IT IS STILL NOT CLEAR 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE AID WHEN IT 
ARRIVES ON BOARD AMERICAN 
OFFICIALS ARE HOPING THEY CAN 
PERSUADE THE BURMESE MILITARY TO 
ACCEPT MUCH MORE BUT THERE ARE NO 
GUARANTEES 
JUST TAKING IN ALL THE GUARANTEES SUPPLIES YOU NEED AND DUMPING THEM 
ON THE GROUND IN THE AIRPORT 
DOESN'T DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD IF YOU 
DON'T HAVE THE NETWORK TO PULSE IT 
OUT TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE SO THEY 
ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED YOU HAVE 
TO HAVE THE ASSISTANT WORKERS TO 
DISTRIBUTE IT 
INSIDE BURMA SOME 
SIGNS OF PROGRESS UNITED NATIONS 
FOOD SUPPLIES FINALLY REACHING SOME 
OF THE MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
OF SURVIVORS A FRACTION OF WHAT IS 
REQUIRED BUT ROUGHLY HALF OF THOSE 
IN NEED ARE GETTING SOME HELP THE THE WHOLE EFFORT HAS SHIFTED GEARS AND 
PROBABLY WE HAVE DOUBLED THE NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN REACHED IN 
THE LAST TWO DAYS SO MUCH MORE IS 
GETTING OUT THERE TO PEOPLE WHO 
NEED IT 
FOR FOREIGN RESCUE TEAMS 
THOUGH THE FRUSTRATION KEEPS 
GROWING BURMESE EMBASSYS REFUSING 
TO GRANT VISAS 
THERE WAS A WOMAN 
FROM FRANCE ASKING FOR A VISA AND 
THEY SAY YOU CAN COME IN THREE 
DAYS SO FOR HUMANITARIAN HELP NO 
VISA BUT FOR TOURISTS IT IS O. K. IN IN THE DISASTER ZONE TODAY MANY 
FAMILIES ARE STILL WAITING FOR AID 
OBLIGED TO DRINK CONTAMINATED WATER 
RAISING FEARS OF A NEW WAVE OF 
DISEASES AND DEATH NOW BURMESE 
OFFICIALS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT SOME 
PARTS OF THE DELTA HAVE STILL NOT 
BEEN REACHED AT ALL TEN DAYS AFTER 
THE CYCLONE 
BRITAIN'S BIGGEST BANK H. S. B. C. HAS 
ANNOUNCED MORE BIG LOSSES AS A 
RESULT OF ITS EXPOSURE TO THE U. S. 
SUB PRIME MARKET THE LOSSES COME 
ON TOP OF BILLIONS OF POUNDS OF 
WRITE OFFS ALREADY ANNOUNCED HUGH 
PYM IS HERE TO EXPLAIN MORE 
YES MORE BANKING BAD DEBTS ARE 
COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK ONCE 
AGAIN THE RESULT OF THE U. S. HOUSE 
PRICE SLUMP AND HOMEOWNERS 
DEFAULTING ON THEIR LOANS H. S. B. C. IS 
WRITING OFF ANOTHER ONE POINT SIX BILLION 
ITS TOTAL LOSSES NOW STAND AT NINE 
BILLION RBS HAS REVEALED LOSSES OF 
SIX POINT TWO BILLION AND BARCLAYS ONE POINT SEVEN 
BILLION THOUGH BOTH MAY HAVE MORE 
TO SAY WITH RESULTS OUT LATER THIS 
WEEK EXPERTS SAY H. S. B. C. 
HAVE 
AMERICAN PROBLEMS BUT INCOME FROM 
OTHER ECONOMIES WILL HELP OFFSET 
THAT 
IN CONSUMER FINANCE CREDIT THAT CARDS THAT IS WHERE THINGS ARE 
LOOKING BAD IN THE U. S. IN FACT THE 
U. S. IS IN A DE FACTO RECESSION H. S. B. C. 
WILL SUFFER FROM THAT IT IS A 
GLOBAL BANK 
BANK LOSSES HAVE AN 
IMPACT ON MORTGAGES LENDERS ARE 
LESS WILLING TO ADVANCE FUNDS SO 
COSTS ARE STILL RISING THE AVERAGE 
DEAL AVAILABLE IS SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THREE PER CENT UP A BIT 
ON WHERE IT WAS LAST WEEK SO LIFE 
IS NOT GETTING ANY EASIER FOR 
PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A NEW MORTGAGE 
LENDERS HAVEN'T GOT THE MONEY SO 
THERE IS LACK OF FUNDS OUT THERE 
BUT SECONDLY THEY ARE GETTING 
MORE AND MORE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE 
RISK THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE L. 
THINK IT'S THE SECOND THING WE ARE 
SEEING BITING DAY BY DAY NOW 
THE COST OF MORTGAGES IS A WORRY 
FOR SOME HOUSEHOLDS SO TOO 
PRICES OF EVERYDAY ITEMS THERE 
WERE FIGURES OUT TODAY FOR 
WHOLESALE PRICES THAT IS ON GOODS 
AND PRODUCTS LEAVING THE FACTORIES 
THEY SHOW AN ANNUAL INCREASE OF 
SEVEN POINT FIVE PER CENT A RECORD HIGH THE FEAR IS 
THAT FLOWS THROUGH TO PRICES IN THE 
SHOPS AND FOR FOOD THEY'RE ALREADY 
RAISING RAPIDLY 
IT'S NOT JUST FOOD MORTGAGES AND 
ENERGY BILLS COULD BE ON THE RISE 
AGAIN AFTER THE OWNERS OF BRITISH 
GAS SAY WHOLESALE PRICES HAVE RISEN 
AGAIN THIS YEAR 
CENTRICA SAYS IT WILL DELIVER 
REASONABLE MARGINS IN ITS RETAIL 
BUSINESS BUSINESS ALAN ASHER JOINS US NOW 
WE MIGHT NOT LIKE THE PRICE RISES 
MR. ASHER BUT ARE THEY INEVITABLE 
IN YOUR VIEW GIVEN THE INCREASE IN 
THE WHOLESALE PRICE OF GAS 
CERTAINLY WHOLESALE GAS PRICES ARE 
GOING UP BUT LET'S REMEMBER THAT 
CENTRICA IS ALSO MAJOR GAS 
PRODUCER IT'S NOT BUYING ALL OF 
ITS GAS ON THE MARKET IT'S NOT 
FAIR TO SAY THAT ALL OF THE RISK 
HAS TO BE PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS 
IN OTHER INDUSTRIES RETAIL THEY 
WILL CUT THEIR MAR GRINS AND GET 
MORE EFFICIENT IN THIS CASE THEY 
CAN PASS IT ON BECAUSE IT'S NOT 
COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY 
WHAT SHOULD 
HAPPEN THEN IN YOUR CREW VUE TO 
STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING TWO TWO THINGS CERTAINLY FOR THE 
WHOLESALE MARKET WE HAVE TO GET 
THAT SORTED OUT OF COURSE THAT IS 
A REGULATORY GOVERNMENT ISSUE FOR 
ORDINARY CONSUMERS ESPECIALLY 
THOSE IN FUEL POVERTY THE 
RETAILERS HAVE JUST GOT TO STOP 
EXPLOITING THE VERY POOREST YOU 
KNOW THEY SOMETIMES CHARGE UP TO 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY AL YEAR MORE FOR THOSE ON PRE 
PAYMENT METERS THAN THEY DO FOR 
THOSE ON CREDIT METERS THAT HAS TO 
BE REBALANCED 
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU 
ARE SAYING THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT 
DOING ENOUGH TO PROTECT THE 
CONSUMER 
CERTAINLY NOT TEN CONSUMER CHARITIES JUST TWO WEEKS AGO 
CRITICISED THE GOVERNMENT NOT FOR 
NOT SPENDING MORE THEY ARE DOING 
SOME BUT NOT PUTTING ENOUGH 
PRESSURE ON SUPPLIERS TO CARE FOR 
THOSE IN SOCIETY WHO HAVE FEWER 
CHOICES THEY CAN'T SWITCH THEY 
DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY THEY ARE 
STUCK WITH OLD TECHNOLOGY AND ARE 
BEING BADLY EXPLOITED BY SUPPLIERS 
AS WE KNOW THE PROBLEM WON'T GO 
AWAY MORE ON THIS TO COME MR. 
ASHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IT'S ONE EIGHTEEN P. M. OUR TOP STORY A 
MASSIVE RESCUE OPERATION UNDER WAY 
AFTER A POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE STUCK 
SOUTH WEST CHINA 
COMING UP A HEADACHE FOR FACEBOOK 
ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO USE THE SITE 
BEING DUPED INTO TAKING OUT EASY 
LOANS LOANS LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON 
JOY FOR ROY HODGSON'S MEN AS THEY 
KEEP THEIR PLACE IN THE TOP FLIGHT 
AND MESSING ABOUT ON THE RIVER WE 
MEET THE WOOLWICH FERRYMEN 
NEW CONTROVERSIAL CHANGES TO 
FERTILITY LAWS START BEING DEBATED 
BY M. P.'S TODAY IN THE COMMONS 
SUPPORTERS SAY THEY'RE ESSENTIAL TO 
HELP WITH MEDICAL RESEARCH INTO 
DISEASES SUCH AS ALZHEIMER'S AND 
CANCER BUT MANY M. P.'S ARE DEEPLY 
OPPOSED TO THE MEASURES WHICH WOULD 
GO THE GO AHEAD TO ANIMAL EMBRYOS 
OUR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT FERGUS 
WALSH HAS MORE DETAILS 
DO THESE IMAGES SHOCK YOU THEY'RE 
EMBRYOS CREATED IN NEWCASTLE BY 
SCIENTISTS WHO MIXED HUMAN AND 
ANIMAL D. N. A. THEY'RE SO CALLED 
HYBRID EMBRYOS AND ARE DESTROYED 
WHEN STILL SMALLER THAN A PINHEAD 
IN THE HOPE OF IMPROVING OUR 
UNDERSTANDING OF A RANGE OF 
DISEASES LEADING MEDICAL CHARITIES 
SUPPORT THIS RESEARCH NOW M. P.'S WILL 
GET A CHANCE TO VOTE WHETHER IT 
SHOULD CONTINUE 
ANOTHER KEY ISSUE IS SAVIOUR 
SIBLINGS BY SELECTING COMPATIBLE 
EMBRYOS DURING I. V. F. IT MEANS 
UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD CAN BE TAKEN 
FROM A NEWBORN BABY AND USED TO 
TREAT SICK SIBLING IT WORKED FOR 
CHARLIE WHITTAKER CURED BY HIS 
INFANT BROTHER JAMIE IS IT 
ETHICAL M. P.'S REPRESENTING OPPOSING 
VIEWS SAY THE ISSUES IN THE BILL 
ARE CRUCIAL TO SOCIETY 
IF WE ARE STARTING TO USE EMBRYOS 
TO PRODUCE POSSIBLE SPARE PARTS FOR 
CONSENTING ADULTS SUCH AS 
OURSELVES AND PEOPLE THAT ARE 
ALREADY BORN WE ARE 
DIFFERENTIATING THAT THOSE WHO ARE 
BORN AND THOSE YET TO BE BORN I'M 
AFRAID THAT AND BELIEVE THAT LIFE 
STARTS AT CONCEPTION 
IT'S A 
BALANCE OF ETHICS IS THERE A 
COALITION OF PATIENT GROUPS 
DOCTORS SCIENTISTS AND POLITICIANS 
WHO BELIEVE THAT IT'S ETHICALLY 
ACCEPTABLE TO USE EMBRYOS FOR 
MEDICAL RESEARCH WE HAVE SINCE 
NINETEEN NINETY THIS BILL IS A NECESSARY 
UPDATING OF THE PROVISIONS THAT 
HAVE BEEN USED IN THIS COUNTRY FOR 
NEARLY THE LAST TWENTY YEARS 
THEN THERE IS ABORTION THE TIME 
LIMIT IS TWENTY FOUR WEEKS BUT THERE WILL 
BE AMENDMENTS TO REDUCE IT TO TWENTY 
WEEKS AND EVEN LOWER 
WHERE DOES LIFE BEGIN AND WHAT ARE 
THE RIGHTS OF THE EMBRYO AND THE 
UNBORN CHILD THESE ARE HUGE 
PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS IT'S BEEN 
NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE M. P.'S HAVE HAD 
A CHANCE TO CHANGE THE LAW ON KEY 
ISSUES NEXT WEEK THEY WILL GET A 
FREE VOTE IT WILL MEAN PUTTING 
CONSCIENCE BEFORE PARTY POLITICS 
MICHAEL STONE WHO TWENTY YEARS AGO 
OPENED FIRE ON REPUBLICAN FUNERAL 
IN BELFAST HAS GONE ON TRIAL FOR 
THE ATTEMPTED MURDERS OF GERRY 
ADAMS AND MARTIN MCGUINNESS THE 
PROSECUTION HAS ALLEGED HE PLANNED 
TO SLIT THE THROATS OF THE SINN 
FEIN LEADERS WHEN HE TRIED TO BREAK 
INTO STORMONT IN TWO THOUSAND SIX STONE CLAIMS 
HIS ATTACK WAS PERFORMANCE ART AND 
DENIES THE CHARGES 
THE SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE FACEBACK 
IS BEING ACCUSED OF LAY LOWING 
YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE UNFAIRLY 
TARGETED BY COMPANIES OFFERING EASY 
LOAN THE DEBT CHARITY CREDIT 
ACTION SAYS THEED VERTS BREAK THE 
LAW BECAUSE THEY DON'T GIVE DETAILS 
OF INTEREST RATES AND HAVE 
COMPLAINED TO THE OFFICE OF OF FAIR 
TRADING ERROR ERROR REPORTS 
BORROWING MONEY IS BECOMING HARDER 
BUT SOME FRINGE LENDERS ARE FAR 
TARGETING YOUNG PEOPLE IN NEED OF 
CASH LOG ON TO FACEBOOK THE 
SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE AND YOU ARE 
LIKELY TO FIND A RASH OF ADVERTS 
FROM FIRMS OFFERING LOANS 
WHAT CAN 
SEE HERE IS A NUMBER EXAMPLES OF 
THE TYPE OF ADVERT WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT 
ACT CHARITY SAYS AT VERTS ABOUT LIKE THIS ARE NOT UPFRONT ABOUT 
THEIR TRUE COSTS YOU WILL HAVE TO 
DIG DEEP FOR INSTANCE TO FIND THE 
STARTLING INTEREST RATE THIS FIRM 
CHARGES 
THE ADVERTS WE ARE FINDING CHARGES ON FACEBOOK DON'T CONTAIN THE 
INFORMATION YOU SHOULD HAVE 
INTEREST RATES ARE NOT BEING 
CLEARLY DISPLAYED PEOPLE SIGNING 
UP FOR THIS KIND OF CREDIT WON'T BE 
AWARE OF HOW MUCH IT WILL COST THEM 
THE COST IS GENERALLY VERY HIGH IF 
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION 
THEY NEED BECAUSE THE ADVERTS ARE 
NOT DISPLAYING IT WE THINK THAT 
IS A PROBLEM 
THERE ARE STRICT 
RULES GOVERNING ADVERTISING CREDIT 
THEY APPLY TO A WEBSITE LIKE 
FACEBOOK AS TO TRADITIONAL MEDIA 
LIKE T. V. AND NEWSPAPERS BASED IN THE 
U. K. THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING HERE 
SAYS IT'S GOING TO HAVE A LOOK AT 
THESE ADVERTS 
THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY SAYS ITS 
FACEBOOK ADVERTS WERE PLACED BY A 
BROKER AND IT'S ORDERED THE FIRM TO 
TAKE THEM DOWN FACEBOOK TOLD US 
IT'S INVESTIGATING THE 
ADVERTISEMENTS IN QUESTION AND IT 
PORNTED OUT ITS ADVERTISERS ARE 
REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE SITE'S 
GUIDELINES FOR APPROPRIATE 
ADVERTISING AND TO MEET LOCAL LAWS 
AND REGULATIONS 
IT ATTRACTS AN AUDIENCE OF YOUNG 
PEOPLE WHO MAY BE DESPERATE FOR 
CASH BUT THE CREDIT ACTION CHARITY 
WILL HOPE THAT USERS ARE WARY OF 
EASY MONEY 
FOR EVERY BUDDING EXPERT OUT THERE 
WHO THINKS THEY KNOW A THING OR TWO 
ABOUT WHAT GROWS IN THE GARDEN 
HERE'S A REAL CHALLENGE THE 
NATIONAL TRUST IS CARRYING OUT A 
HUGE SURVEY OF EVERY PLANT GROWING 
AT MORE THAN EIGHTY OF ITS PROPERTIES 
IN ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN 
IRELAND THE AUDIT WILL TAKE THREE 
YEARS IT'S HOPED SOME NEW AND 
EXOTIC SPECIES WILL COME TO LIGHT 
JON KAY IS AT KILLERTON HOUSE IN 
EXETER WHERE COUNTING HAS BEGUN 
WHAT A LOVELY JOB YOU HAVE TODAY 
JON 
IT REALLY IS PEOPLE COME OVER JON HERE FROM THE SOUTH WEST TO SEE 
THIS INCREDIBLE WISTERIA AT THIS 
TIME OF THE YEAR THIS IS WISTERIA 
SINENSUS THE NATIONAL TRUST KNOWS 
ITS IDENTITY BUT THEY ONLY HAVE 
FORMAL RECORDS FOR ABOUT FIVE PER CENT OF ALL 
OF THE PLANTS AT THEIR VARIOUS 
PROPERTIES THEY'RE STARTING THE 
U. K.'S BIGGEST EVER PLANT HUNT AND 
FRANKLY THEY COULDN'T HAVE PICKED A 
MORE GLORIOUS DAY TO START IT 
BURSTING TO LIFE IN THE SUNSHINE 
THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME OF YEAR TO 
TAKE STOCK OF WHAT'S IN YOUR GARDEN 
BUT FOR THE NATIONAL TRUST IT'S 
GOING TO BE A MAMMOTH TASK 
IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST THREE YEARS 
TO RECORD AND PHOTOGRAPH EVERY 
SINGLE PLANT 
WELL IF IT WAS THIS 
RHODODENDRON WE WERE GOING TO BE 
SURVEYING 
ALONG WITH THEIR SURVEYING PRUNING SHEARS GARDENERS LIKE KATE 
TEWKE HAVE SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY TO 
PLOT THE EXACT LOCATION OF EACH 
TREE BUSH AND BEDDING PLANT THEY 
CARE FOR BUT WHY BOTHER 
IT IS 
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WE FULLY 
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS WE ARE 
LOOKING AFTER IN THE HOUSES THEY 
RECORD EVERY LAST DETAIL OF WHAT 
THEY OWN RIGHT DOWN TO THE LAST 
THIMBLE HERE IN THE GARDEN WE 
DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF ALL OF THE PLANTS 
WE LOOK AFTER 
IT'S SUCH HUGE TASK THAT THE 
OFFICIAL GARDENING TEAMS WILL BE 
GETTING HELP FROM AN ARMY OF 
NATIONAL TRUST VOLUNTEERS TO HO ARE 
MORE USED TO SERVING CREAM TEAS 
THAN ORDERING PLANTS WHAT EXCITES 
THEM MOST OF ALL IS FINDING SPECIES 
THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT LIKE 
THIS EXOTIC PLANT RECENTLY 
DISCOVERED IN CORNWALL BROUGHT 
BACK FROM AUSTRALIA BY VICTORIAN 
ADVENTURERS AS WELL AS BEING 
RECORDED AND PHOTOGRAPHED EXPERTS 
WILL TAKE CUTTINGS FROM SPECIES 
LIKE THIS AND PROPAGATE THEM A AT A 
NEW PLANT CENTRE IN DEVON 
THAT'S WHY THE INFORMATION MATTERS 
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WITH THE 
INFORMATION F. WE CAN WRITE IT DOWN 
IT'S THERE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS 
AND THEN THEY CAN APPRECIATE THE 
PLANTS RATHER THAN SEEING THEM AT 
FACE VALUE 
THE TRUST TRIED DO A 
NATIONAL PLANT SURVEY IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
BUT GAVE UP BECAUSE IT WAS TOO 
COMPLEX THIS TIME WITH THE HELP 
OF TECHNOLOGY THEY HOPE THEY CAN 
FINISH THE JOB 
THEY'VE STARTED HERE TODAY AT 
KILLERTON HOUSE OUTSIDE EXETER SEVENTY NINE 
MORE NATIONAL TRUST PROPERTIES TO 
FOLLOW OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS OR 
SO BRINGING THE TOTAL OF PLANTS 
THAT THEY HOPE THEY WILL KNOW ABOUT 
TO ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL THEY'VE 
STARTED WORK HERE THEY WILL START 
WITH THE TREES THE BUSHES THE 
HEDGES MAKING THEIR WAY INTO THE 
HERBACEOUS BORDERS APPARENTLY 
THEY'RE EVEN GOING TO AUDIT SOME OF 
THE WEEDS OR WILD FLOWERS AS 
THEY PREFER TO CALL THEM HERE 
JON THANK YOU VERY MUCH NICE DAY 
TO START LET'S SEE IF THAT WEATHER 
WILL CONTINUE KIRSTY AND I HAVE 
BEEN DISCUSSING TAN LINES WE'LL WE'LL SAY NO MORE ON THAT 
WHAT CAN WE 
EXPECT TO COME KIRSTY 
THE BURNING 
QUESTION IS WILL WE HOLD ON TO THE 
SUNSHINE YES THIS AFTERNOON 
THERE'S MORE SUNSHINE BUT AFTER 
THAT THERE IS A CHANGE COMING 
LATER ON THIS WEEK 
LATER ON THIS WEEK 
THIS AFTERNOON IT'S LOOKING SUNNY 
AND WARM MUCH OF THE COUNTRY 
ENJOYING CLEAR SKIES A FEW 
EXCEPTIONS HERE AND THERE L. WILL 
GET TO THOSE IN A LITTLE BIT FOR 
NOW WE WILL FOCUS ON THE WARM DRY 
SUNNY WEATHER TEMPERATURES ALREADY 
HAVE NUDGED TWENTY SIX CELSIUS IN PLACES 
MAYBE THE ODD SHOWER UP IN THE 
NORTH WEST AND YOU WILL NOTICE IT 
WILL BE COOLER AROUND THE EAST 
COAST WE STILL HAVE A BIT OF LOW 
CLOUD AND MISTINESS HERE 
TEMPERATURES IN STRUGGLING IN 
NEWCASTLE OVERNIGHT TONIGHT WE 
WILL SEE LOW CLOUD AND MIST AND FOG 
ROLLING IN OFF THE NORTH SEA FROM 
THE WASH NORTHWARDS 
OTHERWISE IT'S DRY OVERNIGHT 
TONIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL BE NINE 
TO TWELVE DEGREES CELSIUS 
AS WE HEAD INTO TOMORROW WE WILL 
SEE SOME LOW CLOUD AROUND IN THE 
MORNING ACROSS EASTERN AREAS BUT 
FURTHER WEST IT'S A CRACKING START 
IT WILL BE DRY AND SUNNY THE WIND 
IS SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT 
BE A LITTLE BIT BREEZIER ACROSS 
ENGLAND AND WALES 
THE EASTERLY WINDS WILL STRENGTHEN 
A LITTLE 
ANOTHER DRY SUNNY STORY FOR MOST 
OF US IT LOOKS BETTER FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND SCOTLAND TOMORROW WE 
DID SEE THE ODD SHOWER TODAY L. 
DON'T THINK WE WILL SEE THAT 
TOMORROW IT WILL BE A DRY STORY 
HERE WITH GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE 
BUT EASTERN SCOTLAND FROM 
ABERDEENSHIRE THROUGH FIFE IN 
TOWARDS NORTHUMBERLAND AND IN 
EASTERN ENGLAND WE WILL SEE A DULL 
AND GREY START TO THE DAY 
HEAD TO THE SOUTH EAST AND EAST 
ANGLIA WE HAVE THE EASTERLY BREEZE 
AND SOME SUNSHINE TO START THE DAY 
THAT CLOUD WILL BREAK UP AS THE DAY 
GOES ON SO MOST OF US WILL BECOME 
SUNNY IF YOU DON'T START THAT WAY 
THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE VERY
