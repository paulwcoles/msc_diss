OFFICIALLY IN TRAINING MASTER 
MINDED WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIM I I DON'T USUALLY GET EMOTIONAL ABOUT

THE HILL AT CHELTENHAM I THINK 
HE'S ONE OF THE HORSES I'VE EVER 
SEEN SEEN YES WE HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD RACES

IT'S JUST AS GOOD THIS AFTERNOON 
LET'S CHECK OUT THE DETAILS MASTER MINDED IS A RED HOT

NON RUNNERS DON'T BACK THESE 
MONET'S GARDEN RAN YESTERDAY 
ARDAGHEY IS A NON RUNNER BECAUSE HE 
IS IN THE NATIONAL FIELD TOMORROW 
A HIVE OF ACTIVITY IN THE BETTING 
RING BUT IT HAS BEEN RELATIVELY 
QUIET IN THE OFFICES THIS MORNING 
PUNTERS GOT THEIR FINGERS BURNT 
WITH KAUTO STAR IN ONE RACE AND 
THE FAVOURITE LOSING IN THE FIRST 
RACE RACE THE BEST EACH WAY HORSE OF THE DAY 
IS SOUFFLEUR AND PLENTY OF HORSES

EVENS AT ELEVEN TO TEN SHOT 
YES HAVE YOU TO GO AFTER THE

ALL ABOUT THE COLOURS OF THE HATS 
OF THE LADIES 
DAN WALKER IS TALKING TO THE L. V. E. R. 
POOL LADIES THIS AFTERNOON BUT I 
DON'T THINK HE'LL SUR VIVE

SIX TO FOUR FOR HIM TO COLLAPSE 
THIS IS WHAT LADIES DAY IS ALL 
ABOUT THESE ARE ALL FRIENDS ELEVEN OF 
THEM A FULL FOOTBALL TEAM FROM 
DINGLE IN LIVERPOOL WHAT MAKES 
LADIES DAY AT THE GRAND NATIONAL SO

CONFUSED WITH SAINT TROPEZ THIS IS 
WHAT LADIES DAY IS ALL ABOUT 
PLENTY OF FLESH ON DISPLAY THERE

CONCENTRATING ON NOW SNOO AND I 
THINK TWO OF THE BEST LOOK ARE IN 
THE NEXT RACE ALBERTAS RUN HE IS 
GORGEOUS 
YES GIVE HIM A SUMMER GORGEOUS OUT ON GRASS AND HE'LL LOOK WELL 
THIS IS BIG BUCK'S HE RAN NICELY 
AT CHELTENHAM OVER TWENTY FIVE THAT'S THE 
FIRST TIME WE'VE BEEN FURTHER THAN 
TWO MILES THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE IS A BIT OF A STEP 
UP BUT IT MIGHT SUIT HIS RUNNING 
AND WORD ON KAUTO STAR HOW IS HE 
THIS MORNING 
HE IS FINE LOOKING 
AT IT ON REFLECTION HE SIMPLY 
DIDN'T JUMP WELL ENOUGH AND THE 
MISTAKE AT THE SECOND LAST LOST HIM 
THE RACE HE'S GOT AWAY WITH IT 
BEFORE BUT DIDN'T YESTERDAY AND 
HE JUMPED SLOPPYLY 
AND UP IN THE COMMENTARY BOX IS 
RICHARD AND IAN YES THE THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE IS 
SO EXCITING 
IT IS WHAT I FIND 
BECAUSE I'M OUT IN THE COUNTRY FOR 
THIS RACE IS THE PACE IS SO MUCH 
DIFFERENT EYE FOX HUNTERS THEY GO 
SLOWLY TODAY WILL BE A LOT FASTER 
AND TOMORROW WILL BE EVEN FASTER 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE 
FURTHER TO GO AND A LOT MORE HORSES 
LET'S CATCH UP THE RUNNERS AND 
RIDERS FOR THE FIRST RACE EIGHT RUN IN THE FIRST AND THEY ARE 
AT THE HOST 
POST A VERY SOLID FAVOURITE 
ALBERTAS RUN RUN ALBERTAS RUN SMASH HORSE WHO WON 
AT SHELTHAM AND BEAT ROLL ALONG 
THERE A LOVELY LOVELY PROGRESSIVE 
HORSE 
HE IS AND HE WINS A LOT OF HORSE RACES HE'S ALREADY WON FOUR OF HIS 
FIVE STARTS THIS SEASON 
HE IS THE ONE THEY HAVE TO BEAT 
BUT WE SAW A COUPLE YESTERDAY WHO 
WON AT CHELTENHAM BUT DIDN'T WIN 
HERE 
AND BATTLE CRY IS BY THE SAME HERE STALLION YES THE FORM IS IN THE BOOK BUT 
THERE IS NO REAL REASON SHOULD 
ALBERTAS RUN COME TO FORM WHY 
BATTLECRY WON'T FINISH AHEAD OF HIM 
THIS IS CORBIER ERIC'S CHARM'S WHO WON THIS ONE DRIFTED IN THE BETTING I 
WAS SURPRISED ABOUT THAT HIS 
TRAINER SAYS THEY'RE GOING TO TRY 
AND RIDE HIM CLOSER TO THE PACE SO 
HE COULD BE CLOSE TO ALBERTAS RUN 
AND HE WILL BE FRESHER HE HE CERTAINLY WILL BIG BUCK'S IS IN 
THE STEWART FAMILY COLOURS THERE 
THIS HORSE IS GOING UP IN TRIP FOUR 
THAT SUIT HIM 
WE DON'T KNOW THE 
TRAINER HAS A LOT OF GOOD HORSES 
SO WE HAVE TO TRUST HIM HE'S AN 
INTERESTING ONE BECAUSE OF THE 
INCREASE IN TRIP THERE IS A 
POSSIBILITY OF HIM IMPROVING HE 
HAD A LOT OF BAD LUCK AT CHELTENHAM 
BUT HE IS A VERY BIG REASONER 
THEY'RE COMING IN AND THEY'RE NOT 
GOING TO HANG AROUND THEY'RE 
OFF AND RUNNING SETTING OFF ON THIS THREE MILES ONE TRIP

DOWN THE BACK TOWARDS THE LAST 
PLAIN FENCE ON THE FAR SIDE AND 
IT'S BATTLECRY WHO CLEARS IT WELL 
HE'S ABOUT TWO LENGTHS CLEAR OF 
ALBERTAS RUN WHO IS LOOMING UP AS 
THE DANGER FOLLOWED BY JOE LIVELY 
BEHIND THEM ROLL ALONG IS BEING 
KICKED ALONG OUT WIDE ON THE TRACK 
STARZAAN IS TRYING TO GET INTO IT 
FROM CEDRUS LIBANI AND BIG BUCK'S 
TACKING ON TO THE REAR OF THAT 
GROUP THEY COME TOWARDS FOUR OUT 
AND MONZON HAS TAILED OFF 
BATTLECRY LEADS LANDS FULL OF 
RUNNING FROM ALBERTAS RUN AND JOE

STRAIGHT ON THE FAR SIDE IT'S 
BATTLECRY FOR PADDY BRENNAN HE 
COMES TO THE THIRD LAST AND JUMPS 
IT MAGNIFICENTLY AND LANDS FULL OF 
RUNNING BY TWO LENGTHS TO ALBERTAS 
RUN GIVING CHASE THIRD JOE LIVELY 
FOLLOWED BY BIG BUCK'S FROM 
STARZAAN HE TOOK OFF TOO EARLY AT 
THE OPEN DITCH BATTLECRY BUT STILL 
LANDED IN TACT BIG BUCK'S IS NOW 
COMING AS THE DANGER BIG BUCK'S 
LOOMS UP NOW WITH ONE LEFT TO JUMP 
AS BATTLECRY IN THE CENTRE AND BIG 
BUCK'S ON THE NEAR SIDE THEY'RE 
CLEAR OF JOE LIVELY ONE LEFT TO 
JUMP A BETTER JUMP BY BIG BUCK'S 
WHO LANDED FULL OF RUNNING ON THE 
NEAR SIDE BATTLECRY SETTLES DOWN 
TO FIGHT IT OUT BUT BIG BUCK'S IS 
COMING HOME THE STRONGER AND RUBY 
WALSH GETS ON THE WINNER HERE HE 
WINS WELL BY TWO OR THREE LENGTHS 
A FIGHT FOURTH BETWEEN ROLL ALONG 
AND JOE LIVELY 
AND JOE LIVELY HAS JUST BUCKED AND 
JOE TIZZARD HAS GONE OUT OF THE 
SIDE DOOR 
MONZON HAS FINISHED LAST CEDRUS 
LIBANI HAS PARTED COMPANY WITH 
DENIS O'REGAN BUT BOTH UP ON THEIR 
FEET IN FRONT OF THE STANDS SO THE 
WINNER IS BIG BUCK'S RIDDEN BY 
RUBY WALSH TRAINED BY PAUL 
NICHOLLS SECOND IS BATTLECRY 
WELL THAT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY RUN 
BECAUSE THIS HORSE MADE A FEW 
MISTAKES DOWN THE BACK STRAIGHT AND 
ALMOST DROPPED OUT SECOND TO LAST 
COMING TO THE LAST BATTLECRY WHO 
MADE A MISTAKE AT THE SECOND LAST 
MEETS THE LAST REALLY WELL BUT SO 
TOO BUS BIG BUCK'S AND HAS THE 
MOMENTUM PAUL NICHOLLS WAS GOING 
NUTS SCREAMING ON THIS HORSE HE 
THINKS A LOT OF HIM AND ALWAYS HAS 
DONE AND RUBY WALSH IS ON THE 
WINNERS' BOARD AGAIN AND A MUCH 
HAPPIER FACE THAN YESTERDAY 
IT WAS 
AN EXCITING RACE CLARE HE MADE 
MISTAKES AND HADN'T TRAVELLED 
PARTICULARLY WELL BUT TURNING INTO 
THE STRAIGHT HE TURNED BACK ON TO 
THE BRIDLE AND AS YOU CAN SEE 
PAUL AND ANTHONY GETTING VERY 
EXCITED 
ANTHONY BOUGHT THE HORSE EXCITED AND SOLD IT TO THE STEWART FAMILY 
AND THIS IS A HORSE THEY KNOW IS 
GOING TO BE SENSATIONAL BUT THE 
QUESTION MARK WAS WHETHER HE WOULD 
STAY AND HE DID 
YES THE GROUND 
MUST HAVE BEEN A BIT TAKE TODAY 
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T REALLY FINISH 
THIS WAS THE ONLY HORSE WHO CAME 
FROM BEHIND HE MISSED ONE DOWN THE 
BACK BUT A LOVELY LOVELY HORSE 
FOR THE FUTURE AND THE FAVOURITE 
ALBERTAS RUN RAN A BIT FLAT JUMPED 
REASONABLY WELL BUT DIDN'T FIND 
ANYTHING ON THE HOME STRAIGHT THE THE WINNING OWNERS ARE WITH RISHI 
THIS IS A FANTASTIC MOMENT FOR YOU 
YOU HAD YOUR FIRST WIN AT THE 
CHELTENHAM FESTIVAL AND NOW TODAY 
YES IT'S MARVELLOUS FANTASTIC FOR 
PAUL TO GET THE HORSE HERE AFTER 
CHELTENHAM WE'RE DELIGHTED PAUL PAUL THIS IS A HARASS WE KNOW YOU'VE 
ALWAYS THOUGHT A LOT OF AND HE'S 
GRADUALLY STEPPED UP IN TRIP AND 
WON TODAY YES HE'S HUGELY THIS IS TERRIFIC LIVERPOOL HAVE 
DONE THIS SO WELL L. JUST FEEL A 
LITTLE SORRY FOR THE YOUNG LADIES 
WALKING AROUND WITH KNOW CLOTHES 
ON ON HE IS RIGHT BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU 
IT IS PRETTY COLD HERE AND YOU 
WOULDN'T KNOW FROM SOME OF THE 
OUTFITS BUT THE JOCKEYS ARE WARMED 
UP NOW BATTLECRY MEASURED THE 
FENCES ALMOST TOO CAREFULLY EARLY 
ON BUT ON THE SECOND TO LAST HE 
MAKES A SIMILAR MISTAKE THAT KAUTO 
STAR LEFT YESTERDAY 
YES KAUTO 
STAR LEFT A HOLE IN THE FENCE 
YESTERDAY THERE IS A LOT OF LEAF 
IN THOSE FENCES AND THEY DON'T STOP 
THE HORSES THAT WAY LIKE THEY 
MIGHT HAVE DONE A COUPLE OF YEARS 
AGO 
THE DANCE WAS A QUARTER OF A AGO LENGTH AND NINE THAT'S OFFICIAL 
AND A MUCH HAPPIER MAN TODAY RUBY 
WALSH HIS FIFTY EIGHTH WINNER THIS SEASON 
IN BRITAIN COULD IT BE THE START 
OF A BIG DAY FOR HIM AND ALSO PAUL 
NICHOLLS NICHOLLS THEY HAVE SOME GREAT CHANCES AND 
HERE IS HE RUBY HE'LL BE WARING 
THOSE COLOURS LATER ON IN GWANAKO 
IN THE JOHN SMITH'S TOPHAM TROPHY 
IT WILL 
BE INTERESTING TO 
GWANAKO ANOTHER IMPORT GETS ON 
BUT THIS IS A FIVE YEAR OLD BIG 
BUCK'S AND YOU WOULD 
THINK IN 
THEORY HE 
IS GOING TO GET 
BETTER 
THEORY HE IS GOING TO GET BETTER AS HE GETS OLDER AND STRONGER KNOWS 
THE WINNERS' 
KNOWS THE WINNERS' ENCLOSURE ALREADY 
AT AINTREE AND 
IMPORTANT O. K. 
THAT'S THE 
ON BOARD LET'S 
CHECK THE WINNERS 
ON BOARD LET'S CHECK THE WINNERS WITH JOHN BOOKMAKERS ARE LAUGHING ONCE AGAIN 
AS THE FAVOURITE GETS TURNED OVER 
THE HORSE IS CALLED BIG BUCK'S NOT 
BECAUSE HE COST A LOT OF MONEY BUT 
BECAUSE HE IS OUT OF A MARE CALLED 
BUCKS SKA HE IS BIG WE HAVE BEEN 
ASKED WHY THE HORSES HAVE A SHEEP 
SKIN NOSE BAND ON AND IT IS 
BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM LOOK DOWN AT 
THE JUMPS 
HE IS NOT A CONSISTENT 
JUMPER ALL ALONG AND THIS ONE HE 
CLIMBS OVER IT 
AND BATTLECRY 
LEAVING THEM A MERRY DANCE AND 
JUMPING ON THE WHOLE WELL IF NOT 
SLIGHTLY BIG 
YES HE'S MADE A 
COUPLE OF MISTAKES ALL AROUND AND 
ON THE SECOND LAST HE STANDS OFF 
JUST MILES TOO FAR FROM THE FENCE 
OH JUST SNATCHED THERE HE WAS IN 
TWO MINDS AND DIDN'T GO CLOSE AND 
SNATCHED AT IT BUT THE ONE THING 
WE HAVE SEEN IT IS PRETTY EVIDENT 
IS THAT THE FENCES ARE MUCH SOFTER 
THESE DAYS WITH A LOT OF LEAF IN 
THE BIRCH AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE 
I'M AN OLD JOCKEY BUT IT IS FOR 
HEALTH AND SAFETY 
YES AND THE SECOND THOUGH A LOT 
OF CREDIT TO HIM HE'S PLUGGED ON 
THERE AND MADE A FEW BAD MISTAKES 
ON THE WAY ROUND BUT HE KEEPS ON 
HIS FEET 
AND ALBERTAS RUN BACK IN 
THIRD IS A SHADE DISAPPOINTING 
SEEING IT FROM THE OPPOSITE ANGLE 
BOTH JOCKEYS HAVE THE WHIPS IN THE 
CORRECT HAND THERE TO KEEP THEIR 
HORSES OFF EACH OTHER RUBY HITTING 
A HORSE WHERE IT SHOULD BE HIT 
DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE HIND QUARTERS 
WHERE THE HIDE IS THICKEST THAT IS THE SMILE OF VICTORY IT'S 
A GOOD FEELING THE HORSE ENJOYED 
IT TOO PRICKING HIS EARS AFTER HE 
CROSSED THE LINE 
I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T BEEN WATCHING 
RACING REGULARLY FOR THE LAST FIVE 
OR SIX YEAR BUS HOW GOOD A JOCKEY 
IS RUBY WALSH 
HE IS ONE OF BEST 
HI THE PLEASURE OF RIDING AGAINST 
HIM FOR ONLY A COUPLE OF YEARS

SO FOCUSED SO DETERMINED 
CERTAINLY RUBY HAS THAT AS WELL DO DO YOU NOTICE A CHANGE IN ATTITUDE I 
KNOW YOU WERE FOCUSED AND SO WAS

IT PROBABLY DID IN HIND 
SIGHT THE FENCE DIDN'T SEEM TO 
STOP HIM MUCH HE DID LOSE A LOT OF 
MOMENTUM HE LANDED ON THE FENCE 
HE DID LOSE SOME MOMENTUM IF HE 
PINGED THAT HE WOULD HAVE LANDED A 
LENGTH AND A HALF IN FRONT AND IT 
MIGHT HAVE GIVEN HIM THE EMPHASIS 
TO COME AFTER HIM 
THIS IS GOING 
THE LAST YOU CAN SEE HIM PRICK HIS 
EARS WAS THERE A LITTLE LEFT IN THE 
TANK 
NO THAT IS ALWAYS HIM HE TANK LOOKS AT EVERYTHING HE LOOKS AT 
CAR SIGNS HE IS A VERY ALERT HORSE 
I WOULD SAY I GAVE EVERYTHING HE 
HAD BUT HE WAS JUST CHINNED YOU YOU CAN SEE HERE AFTER THE RACING THEY 
HADN'T CALLED THE RESULT AT THIS 
STAGE BUT YOU WERE DISAPPOINTED 
WERE YOU DISAPPOINTED FOR THE HORSE 
OR YOURSELF 
BOTH L. WOULDN'T SAY 
EVERYONE GETS INSTRUCTIONS EVERY 
DAY OF THE WEEK BUT YOU HAVE TO 
CARRY THEM OUT AND DO WHAT YOU 
THINK IS RIGHT ON THE DAY THE 
TRAINER IS ON THE STAND THERE IS 
NOTHING HE CAN DO DOWN WHEN THE 
RACE STARTS L. SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN 
HIM ON L. KNEW WHEN I PULLEDED UP I 
WAS BEAT L. KNEW IT WAS RACE I 
FELT I COULD HAVE WON 
YOU FELT YOU 
COULD HAVE WON YOU STILL HOLD HIM 
IN HIGH REGARD 
HE HAS BEEN WONDERFUL HORSE TO ME

BEST PERFORMANCE MUCH HE IS BETTER 
HORSE THAN OUR VIC L. SUPPOSE IN 
THE KING GEORGE WE ASKED HIM TO 
OPEN UP AND HE HAS YESTERDAY HE 
DIDN'T HE GOT IDLE AND GOT CHINNED

THIS HORSE IS THE HIGHEST RATED IN 
ENGLAND AND IRELAND AT THE MOMENT 
MASTERMINDED WE SEE HIM HERE AT 
CHELTENHAM HE LOOKS FAST 
THIS WAS AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE 
MUCH I ALMOST HOPE IT WASN'T TOO 
GOOD TO BE TRUE THE EASE HE DID IT 
WITH WAS EXCEPTIONAL HE QUICKENED 
UP AT THE SECOND LAST AWAY HE WENT 
TO THE LINE THERE IS NOTHING TO 
SUGGEST HE SHOULDN'T GET THE TRIP

HAS BEEN LED INTO THE RACE AND HE 
IS LESS THAN A LENGTH AND A HALF 
MAYBE BEHIND THE LEADER WITH TWO 
FURLONGS TO RUN BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE 
THE ABILITY TO GO ON THE WINNER 
HE HAS WON A FEW RACES BUT HE HAS 
IMPROVED TWENTY ONE A STONE AND A HALF 
MORE THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN 
WE MUST 
MENTIONED TAZBAR L. THOUGHT HE WAS 
NEVER GOING TOO WELL WE WERE O. K. 
FOR A WHILE WITH HIM PHILIP TOOK HIM A LIKELY WIDE FOR 
THE HURDLES BUT HE DIDN'T GO TO 
CHELTENHAM AND IT'S PAID OFF THAT THAT SHOT SHOWED US IT LOOK EASIER THAN 
FROM THE FAR COVERAGE DIDN'T IT 
YES THIS HORSE HAS RUN GREAT 
RACE HE OBVIOUSLY GOT LITTLE 
TIRED GONE TO LUNCH HAVING MADE 
ALL THE PACE HERE'S PADDY COMING IN A VERY 
SUCCESSFUL YOUNG RIDER HIS NINETY TWO E. N. E. D. 
OF THE CAMPAIGN INTERESTING THAT 
NIGEL TWISTON DAVIES HAS FOUR 
RUNNERS TOMORROW L. SPOKE TO HIM 
DURING THE WEEK AND HE SAID HE 
THINKS THEY ARE ALL VERY WELL 
THERE IS HE ON THE RIGHT OF THE 
PICTURE JUST WALKING BEHIND AND A 
MAN WHO HAS TWICE TASTED QUESTIONS 
HERE AT AINTREE IN THE NATIONAL 
WINNING WITH EARTH SUMMIT WHEN THE 
GROUND WAS VERY MUDDY INDEED AND 
BINDAR ERIC'S CHARM A GREAT 
STAYING CHASER A FANTASTIC AND 
CLEVER JUMPER ON HIS DAY O. K. 
PETTIFOUR IS THE WINNER OF RACE 
NUMBER TWO LET'S CHECK THE FULL 
DETAILS WITH JOHN IF YOU WERE IMPRESSED WITH THAT 
WINNER HE'S A FORTY TO ONE QUOTE FOR NEXT 
YEAR'S HURDLE L. THINK THAT IS A 
VERY GOOD QUOTE I'M WITH THE 
WINNING TRAINER YOU WENT CLOSE 
WITH BATTLECRY IN THE RACE AND I 
SAW SOME FRUSTRATION THERE AND I 
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNDER 
PRESSURE HERE AGAIN 
YES IF WE 
WERE SECOND AGAIN IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN TOO MUCH L. THOUGHT SOMETHING 
MIGHT GO WRONG BUT IT DIDN'T A A TERRIFIC BATTLE WITH GONE TO LUNCH 
BOTH JOCKEYS RAN FANTASTIC RACES 
I'M SURE YOU WOULD AGREE 
OH YES 
HE DID A VERY CLEVER TACTIC GETTING 
AWAY FROM US 
ONE THING I'VE 
NOTICED ABOUT PETTIFOUR IS 
IMPROVEMENT IS THE CLEAREST 
HALLMARK OVER THE LAST THREE RACES 
OH YES HE'S HAD FIVE RACES AND 
YES HE KEEPS IMPROVING WE CAN'T 
ASK FOR ANY MORE THAN WHAT HE DOES 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING IT 
HEAR FROM PADDY BRENNAN WELL DONE 
I'M DELIGHTED WHAT TOUGH HORSE 
HE'S ON HIS THIRD RUN OVER HURDLES 
AND WON HIS LAST TWO BUT HE'S SO 
TOUGH HE MISSED ONE OF THEM BADLY 
AND YOU MUST HAVE BEEN A WORRIED 
MAN WITH MCCOY DRIVING UP ON YOUR 
OUTSIDE 
OH HE BEATS ME EVERY DAY OUTSIDE OF THE WEEK AND I'M ON THE BABY 
BUT HE LOVES THE CROWD I'D JUST 
LIKE TO THANK DAVID HE NEVER 
KNOCKED HIM ABOUT AND GAVE HIM A 
LOVELY EDUCATION AND IT'S DOWN TO 
PEOPLE LIKE THAT IT'S A TEAM GAME 
AND I'M JUST LUCKY TO BE A PART OF 
IT IT WAS A TACTICAL RACE BUT 
YOU'LL FIND IN TIME THE BEST HORSE 
WON 
IRISH RAPTOR 
I'M REALLY WON LOOKING FORWARD TO RIDING HIM I'LL 
PROBABLY JINX MYSELF BECAUSE HE'S 
LIKE RIDING OVER HURDLES BUT HE 
LOVES THE GROUND SO I'M JUST GOING 
TO GO OUT AND ENJOY IT AND GET 
ROUND 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE NATIONAL ROUND I'M JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO RIDING 
IT THERE'S PROBABLY A FEW HORSES 
WITH A BETTER CHANCE BUT IF WE 
HAVE THE LUCK WE HAD TODAY YOU 
NEVER KNOW 
IT WILL BE PADDY 
BRENNAN'S THIRD RIDE IN THE GRAND 
NATIONAL AND HE'S BEEN UNSEATED 
ONCE AND FELL THE SECOND TIME SO 
HE WILL BE HOPING TO GET ROUND 
WELL WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET 
UNDER THE COVERS OF AINTREE AND DAN 
WALKER IS THE MAN TO DO IT 
IMAGINE THE SCENE ON GRAND NATIONAL 
DAY ALISTAIR STEWART LIVES HERE 
AND WE CALL HIM THE JUDGE HERE HE 
ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 
TIME THIS IS A BIT POKEY I 
EXPECTED IT TO BE NICER THAN THIS 
BUT THAT VIEW IS SOMETHING ELSE L. 
SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY YOU SIT UP HERE 
HOW DO YOU MAKE THE FINAL DECISION 
IF THERE IS IS A PHOTO FINISH I I LEARN THE COLOURS OF EVERY HORSE IN 
EVERY RACE AND I CAN GENERALLY 
ANNOUNCE THE RESULT AS SOON AS THE 
FIRST FOUR CROSS THE LINE 
WE HAD A 
TIGHT FINISH YESTERDAY KAUTO STAR 
AND OUR VIC RIGHT UP THERE TOGETHER 
HOW EASY WAS THAT TO MAKE THAT 
DECISION 
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY DECISION CLOSE SO I CALLED AL PHOTO FINISH 
AS SOON AS THE COMMENTATOR AS 
FINISHED SPEAKING AND THE PHOTO 
CALL WAS BROUGHT UP AND IT SHOWED 
THAT OUR VIC WON BY A NOSE WHICH 
WAS THE SHORTEST DISTANCE AND I 
WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT 
WITHIN TWENTY SECONDS 
ARE YOU ALLOWED 
TO BET ON THE GRAND NATIONAL SADLY SADLY NO NO SO HE CANNOT PLACE BET AND NO 
ONE QUESTIONS THE JUDGE 
THAT IS HOW THE JUDGE DOES HIS JOB 
BUT SOMEBODY CALLING TIME ON HIS 
JOB IS JOCKEY TONY DOBBIN WHY HAVE 
YOU DECIDED TO CALL IT QUITS I'VE I'VE BEEN THINKING THREE IT FOR A WHILE I'M 
THIRTY SIX NEXT MONTH 
YOU DON'T LOOK IT 
YEAH RIGHT 
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR 
WHILE AND NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT 
YOU'VE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND 
NOW IS THE TIME WHEN YOU WILL BE 
REFLECTING AND LORD GYLLENE WILL 
FIGURE VERY HIGHLY FOR YOU YES YES IT'S EVERY YOUNG JOCKEY'S DREAM TO 
WIN A NATIONAL AND I WAS LUCKY 
ENOUGH TO DO IT AINTREE IN 
PARTICULAR HAS BEEN VERY VERY GOOD 
TO ME I'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO 
RIDE FIVE WINNERS OVER THE NATIONAL 
FENCES SO AINTREE MEANS A LOT TO 
ME 
WHEN YOU THINK BACK TO SOME OF ME THE OTHER GREAT HORSES YOU HAVE 
RIDDEN ONE MAN WOULD BE ANOTHER 
NAME TO GO TO THE TOP OF THE LIST 
YES ONE MAN I WAS LUCKY NEGATIVE 
TO GET JOB WITH GORDON RICHARD 
AND I WAS ONLY TWENTY ONE AT THE TIME IT 
WAS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY AND I 
LEARNT A HELL OF A LOT THERE AND 
I'VE BEEN WITH HIM EVER SINCE 
WAS THE TOP RATED CHASER FOR A GOOD 
FEW YEARS IT'S LOVELY TO BE 
SORNTED WITH HIM AND HORSES LIKE 
THE GREY MONK TO THIS DAY I'LL SAY 
HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST WHO ARES 
I'VE RIDDEN HE WAS JUST A BIT SOFT 
I'VE BEEN VERY LUCKY WITH MY JOB 
AND RACING IN GENERAL IS SOMETHING 
THAT YOU WILL NOT LOSE TOUCH WITH 
I'M SURE BECAUSE THE COMRADERIE 
YOU'VE BUILT UP YOU WON'T WANT TO 
LET GO 
NO IT WILL NEVER LET GO 
RACING IS A VERY CLOSE THING AND 
I'LL STILL SEE ALL THE LADS AND 
THAT MY GIRLFRIEND ROSE HAS GONE 
INTO TRAINING NEXT YEAR AND I'LL DO 
THAT WITH HER THAT'S WHY I'M 
STOPPING NOW I'M GOING TO WORK FOR 
KEVIN RYAN FOR THE SUMMER AND THEN 
WORK ELSEWHERE FOR A COUPLE OF 
WINTERS AND GAIN EXPERIENCE 
THERE'S A PURPOSE BUILT YARD GOING 
TO BUILT AND IT'S GOING TO BE AN 
AMAZING PLACE SO IT'S VERY 
EXCITING L. FEEL NOW LIKE I DID TWENTY 
YEARS AGO WHEN I WANTED TO BECOME A 
JOCKEY 
SO TRAINING IS A JOCKEY POSSIBILITY 
OH IT'S DEFINITELY POSSIBILITY GOING TO HAPPEN FROM ROSE'S POINT 
OF VIEW AND I'M GOING TO HELP HER 
AND HOPEFULLY SUCCESS WILL COME TO 
US AS TRAINERS 
AND WHAT ABOUT 
SATURDAY YOU'RE STILL NOT DONE 
WITH TOMORROW YOU RIDE POINT 
BARROW IN THE GRAND NATIONAL AND HE 
WAS FAVOURITE LAST YEAR 
HE WAS 
AND HE HAS A BIT OF CLASS BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY HE CAME DOWN AT THE 
FIRST HE'S BEEN A BIT IN AND OUT 
THIS YEAR BUT HE HAS THE FORM HE 
RAN WELL IN A HURDLE RACE RECENTLY 
AND HE WASN'T FAVOURITE LAST YEAR 
FOR NO REASON I'M DELIGHTED TO 
RIDE HIM AND I'D LOVE TO GO OUT 
WITH A BANG 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOR TALKING TO US AND WE WISH YOU 
ALL THE BEST IN YOUR FUTURE BUT

MEANWHILE WE JOIN 
THE CELEBRATORY SCENES AFTER THE 
WIN OF PETTIFOUR 
AND CITROEN U. K. THE SPONSORS OF 
THIS RACE GIVING THE TROPHY TO 
PADDY BRENNAN I'M JOINED BY A 
BEST SELLING NOVELIST JILLY COOPER 
BASING A BOOK ONCE AGAIN ON RACING 
I LIKE THIS WORLD I LOVE IT I'M 
BESOTTED BY IT 
AND WHAT IN 
PARTICULAR MAKES IT SUITABLE FOR 
TELLING STORIES 
THE HORSES THE 
HORSES ALWAYS MAKE BEAUTIFUL 
STORIES BECAUSE THEY'RE SO HEROIC 
AND BEAUTIFUL BUT THE JOCKEYS ARE 
SO BRAVE AND THE SECRET OF A 
ROMANTIC HERO IS SOMEBODY WHO IS SO 
BRAVE AND THEY'RE SO MERRY THEY 
MAKE JOKES BEFORE THEY GO OUT AND 
RIDE AND THEY COME IN AND JOKE WHEN 
THEY LOSE 
THERE IS A FAIR BIT OF 
RUMPY PUMPY IN YOUR BOOKS IS THERE 
ANYTHING PARTICULARLY WITH PEOPLE 
ASSOCIATE ASSOCIATED WITH HORSES 
THAT MAKES THEM LIKE THAT 
I READ 
SOMEWHERE THAT THE MOMENT A JOCKEY 
HAS A DRINK HE DROPS HIS TROUSERS 
AND I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THEY 
DON'T EAT ALL DAY SO ONE GIN AND 
TONIC WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO SIX 
FOR US SO THEY GET A BIT CARRIED 
AWAY 
AND DO THINK THEY ARE AWAY ADDICTED TO ADRENALINE 
YES AND IF 
YOU WIN YOU WANT TO CELEBRATE AND 
IF YOU LOSE YOU WANT TO BE CHEERED 
UP SO YOU GRAB A LOVELY GIRL 
AND THERE ARE LOT OF LOVELY GIRLS 
HERE TODAY WHAT HAVE YOU MADE OF 
IT 
WELL RICHARD DUNWOODY HAS JUST IT COME BACK FROM THE NORTH POLE 
HASN'T HE WELL I THINK SOME OF 
THESE GIRLS COULD TEACH HIM A LOT 
ABOUT KEEPING WARM BECAUSE IT IS 
SO COLD AND SOME OF THEM ARE NOT 
WRAPPED UP 
SO TAKE LOOK AND SEE WHAT TAKES YOUR FANCY 
RICHARD AND MYSELF ARE HERE THE 
HORSES 
ARE JUST 
COMING IN TORE THE 
TRACK THIS IS MISTER MCGOLDRICK 
HE LOOKS FINE AND COME OUT OF HIS 
RACE AT CHELTENHAM WELL ENOUGH BUT 
ALL EYES ARE ON MASTER MINDED 
WE SEE HIM HERE NOW AND HE'S 
BEAUTIFUL HORSE L. WAS SAYING TO 
YOU THIS MORNING RICHARD HOW 
GOOD LOOK HE IS HE IS I'M REALLY REALLY IMPRESSED WITH 
THIS HORSE DAN IS WALKING AROUND 
WITH HEM L. LOVE HIM HE'S A GREAT 
SORT AND AS I SAID EARLIER IN THE 
PROGRAMME ONE OF THE BEST 
PERFORMANCES I'VE SEEN FROM A HORSE 
AND LET'S HOPE HE REPEATS IT TODAY 
I HOPE SO 
THEY HAVE BEEN RAVING 
ABOUT THIS HORSE EVER SINCE THE 
PERFORMANCE HE PUT UP TO WIN THE 
QUEEN MOTHER CHASE AT CHELTENHAM L. 
HAVE NEVER SEEN A HORSE COME INTO 
THE LAST RACE GOING AS FAST AS HE 
DID HE TRAVELS AT SPEED AND 
MEASURES HIS FENCES WELL AND HE 
JUST BURNT OUT THE OPPOSITION 
REMEMBERING THAT VOY POR USTEDES IS 
A CHAMPION CHASEER HIMSELF AND HE 
LEAVES HIM STONE COLD ABSOLUTELY 
POWERING OVER THESE HE IS AN 
AMAZING HORSE AND MUST BE AN 
INCREDIBLE SENSATION FOR RUBY WALSH 
TO RIDE HE NEVER LOSES A SECOND 
OVER THE FENCES A REALLY GOOD 
FEELING FEELING I'M WITH MASTER MINDED'S OWNER 
CLIVE SMITH CLIVE RICHARD 
DUNWOODY SAID TO ME EARLIER THAT 
MASTER MINDED IS THE BEST HORSE 
HE'S EVER SEEN 
I MUST SAY I'M 
PRETTY IMPRESSED MYSELF I'VE JUST 
BEEN LOOKING AT HIM AND I THINK HE 
IS SHRENDED L. 
HAD A SPLENDID L. HAD A PHOTOGRAPH SHOWN TO ME OF 
WHEN HE FIRST ARRIVED AT THE YARD 
AND HE HAS COME ON A BOMB AND AND RICHARD SAID HE WAS BLOOMING AND I 
THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A FIGURE OF 
SPEECH BUT HE IS 
YES HE IS 
MARVELLOUS 
AND KAUTO STAR WHAT MARVELLOUS DID YOU MAKE OF IT 
PAUL NICHOLLS 
AND I WERE TALKING YESTERDAY AND HE 
SAID IT WAS DOWN TO THAT ONE JUMP 
WHERE HE TOOK OFF L. HAVEN'T SEEN 
THE JUMP IT WAS JUST A BIG MISTAKE 
AND THAT COST US THE RACE SO THERE 
WE ARE THAT'S RACING 
LET'S HOPE 
THERE ARE NO SUCH MISHAPS WITH 
MASTER MINDED 
I KNOW AFTER BEING 
SO IMPRESSIVE AT CHELTENHAM ONE 
WONDERS WHAT CAN HAPPEN NEXT BUT 
LET'S HOPE IT WORKS OUT 
WELL JUST 
BECAUSE THE FAVOURITE IS GOING TO 
START AT PROHIBITIVE ODDS DOESN'T 
MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE A BET BECAUSE 
YOU CAN FIND BOOKMAKERS YOU'RE 
BETTING WITHOUT FORTY FIVE IS THAT THE THE FAVOURITE IS A SHORT PRICE 
VIRTUALLY A CERTAINTY OR THE 
CLOSEST THING WE CAN GET SO WE 
TAKE THE FAVOURITE OUT AND HAVE A 
RACE WITH THE OTHER RUNNERS IF 
YOUR HORSE WINS YOU WIN AND IF 
YOUR HORSE FINISHES SECOND TO 
MASTER MINDED YOU GET SOME MONEY 
WITH IT 
SO THIS IS THE IDEAL BET 
FOR AVERAGE PEOPLE TO GO ON A BET 
THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING 
YES I THINK SO FROM MY POINT OF 
VIEW WE DO IT EVERY RACE WE 
ALWAYS TAKE WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE 
THE BEST HORSE IN EVERY RACE OUT 
SO IF YOU FANS EANOTHER HORSE 
WITHOUT AND IF YOU COME IN NEXT 
YOU WIN IN FACT IT'S VERY HARD TO 
LOSE 
SO HUNT OUT SOMEBODY LIKE LOSE JOHN JOHN WE'RE HAVING A GOOD LUCK AT THE 
HORSES IN THE RING RICHARD THE 
BETTING SUGGESTS IT IS A ONE HORSE 
RACE BUT OTHERS LOOK FANTASTIC 
TWO OTHER CHAMPION CHASEERS IN THE 
RACE AND NEWMILL LOOKS WELL AND ON 
HIS TOES L. THINK HE WILL BE CLOSE 
TODAY BUT HAS IT ALL TO DO VOY POR 
USTEDES SHOULD CHASE UP THE 
FAVOURITE BUT HE'S NOT AS 
IMPRESSIVE AS THE FAVOUR BUT HE 
SHOULD GIVE HIM FIVE CLOSER RUN TODAY 
FOR HIS MONEY 
I THOUGHT VOY POR 
USTEDES LOOKED A FRACTION DRY IN 
HIS COAT AND TAMARINBLEU WARES 
BLINKERS BUT LOOKS GOOD IN THE 
PADDOCK WITH ME NOW IS THE OWNER 
OF MISTER MCGOLDRICK THE HORSE IS 
NAMED AFTER HIS HEART SURGEON WHO 
SAVED HIS LIFE 
IS THAT NEWS L. 
DIDN'T REALISE THAT 
WELL IT IS 
NEWS THAT YOU ARE STILL ALEAVE AND 
HE WON AT CHELTENHAM AT SIXTY SIX TO ONE HE HE DID AND SOME OF US GOT ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX ON THE 
TOTE AND ANOTHER FRIEND GOT ONE HUNDRED TO ONE 
ON THE BOOKMAKER SO IT WAS A GOOD 
DAY 
AND IT WOULD BE AN EVEN BIGGER DAY SHOCK IF HE WON TODAY WOULD IT 
WELL IT CAN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN 
CHELTENHAM AND TODAY IF HE RUNS 
ANYTHING LIKE AS WELL AS HE DID WE 
MIGHT RUFFLE ONE OR TWO FEATHERS 
BUT ON PAPER THERE ARE THIRTEEN TIPS 
TIPPING MASTER MINDED AND WE'RE 
RAG ONCE AGAIN BUT WE MIGHT GET 
FIFTY TO ONE OUT ON THE COURSE SO THERE WE 
GO 
I'LL LET YOU GO AND FIND IT GO THE HORSES ARE GETTING IN ORDER TO 
PARADE FOR THIS RACE 
THIS FRIDAY MEETING AT AINTREE HAS 
BECOME SO POPULAR THERE IS AN 
ENORMOUS CROWD HERE AND THE SUN IS 
OUT AND THEY WILL REALLY ENJOYING 
IT IT IT IS ONE OF THE REAL FUN RACING 
DAYS OF THE YEAR ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST DAYS ALL BUILDING UP TO 
TOMORROW'S JOHN SMITH'S GRAND 
NATION GRAND NATIONAL 
A HUGE CROWD IN FRONT OF THE STANDS 
AND PLENTY BEHIND AS WELL BUT THAT 
GIVES YOU SOME IDEA OF THE CROWD 
FIGURES FOR YOU THIS NEXT RACE IS 
THE JOHN SMITH'S MEDICALING CHASE 
MELLING CHASE IT IS OVER TWO 
AND A HALF MILES AND IT WILL AN 
TEST FOR MASTER MINDED WHO HAS TO 
GO AN EXTRA HALF MILE TODAY IF 
BOOKIES WERE SETTING UP BOARDS THEY 
WOULD BE BETTING AGAINST HIM 
GETTING IT 
LET'S LOOK AT THE RUNNERS AND 
RIDERS THEY ARE THE SIX RUNNERS MONET'S GARDEN DOES NOT GO IN THIS THREE HUNDRED TEN MASTER MINDED IS A FAVOURITE AT TWO TO FIVE 
ONE RECORDED BET OF FIFTY THOUSAND HAS 
BEEN PUT ON NEWMILL WAS BACKED IN AT ONE HUNDRED TO ONE THIS MORNING WELL WE HAVE ANOTHER BONUS HERE 
TONY MCCOY HAS JOINED ME TONY YOU 
WOULD LOVE TO BE ON MASTER MINDED 
YES MYSELF AND RICHARD COULD ALL 
GET UP ON HIM AND HE'D BE GOOD 
ENOUGH TO WIN WITH THE FOUR OF US 
I'M STILL NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE 
GIVEN HIM NOT A HANDICAP BUT A 
RATING OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY STRAIGHTAWAY I'D 
HAVE LIKED TO SEE HIM A FEW MORE 
TIMES 
AND RICHARD DUNWOODY YOU TIMES LIKED HIM IN THE PADDOCK NEWMILL 
YES AND HE IS STILL ON HIS TOES 
I'M HOPING FOR BETTER RUN FROM 
HIM TODAY 
BUT HE HAS A HUGE PRICE 
AT THIRTY TWO TO ONE TAMARINBLEU TONY YOU 
KNOW HIM A FEW TIMES YOU'VE RIDDEN 
HIM 
YES GREAT CREDIT TO THE PIPES HIM HE'S WON A VICTOR CHANDLER AND 
SEVERAL CHASES 
AND VOY POR USTEDES 
YOU 
THOUGHT HE LOOKED WELL L. THOUGHT HE LOOKED A LITTLE DRY IN 
HIS COAT BUT CAN HE REVERSE PLACES 
WITH MASTER MINDED 
NO I DON'T 
THINK SO HE MIGHT BE CLOSER TO HIM 
BUT HE HAS IT ALL TO DO TODAY 
AND AT THE BOTTOM YES MY LORD 
YES SIR TONY YOU'VE RIDDEN HIM 
YES I 
CHASE A COUPLE OF 
YES I WON A CHASE A COUPLE OF SUMMERS BACK AT MARKET RASEN AND 
HE'S GOOD 
BUT WE'RE ALL AGREED 
THAT MASTER MINDED CAN'T BE BEATEN 
HE'S AS GOOD AS YOU GET REALLY HE HE LOOKS FANTASTIC IN THE RING AND DAN 
SKELETON HAS A LOT TO DO WITH PAUL 
NICHOLLS' TEAM AND HE'S AT THE 
HEAD KEEPING HIM CALMMENT HE HAD AN 
EASY RACE AT CHELTENHAM BUT HIS 
COAT IS REALLY GLEAMING LET'S HAVE 
ANOTHER LOOK AT THE RACE AT 
CHELTENHAM I NEVER EXPECTED A 
HORSE TO GO OUT AND WIN THE QUEEN 
MOTHER STAKES BY NINETEEN LENGTHS 
YES I 
WAS SPEAKING TO RUBY TODAY AND HE 
SAID HE NEVER PUTS HIS HEAD DOWN 
AND HE KEEPS GREAT BALANCE WHEN 
YOU LOOK AT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN 
THE FIRST AND SECOND YOU HAVE TO 
SAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE OTHERS 
TO TURN THE TABLES ON HIM 
I SAW 
TED WALSH LATER THAT DAY AND HE 
SAID RUBY WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE IT 
A TEST OF STAMINA SO THAT TWIST 
MAGIC WOULD NOT BEAT HIM BECAUSE 
HE'D HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO 
AND RUBY CHOSE THIS HORSE 
SHINDLER'S IS HUNT MADE IT THAT DAY 
AND HE WENT OUT TO GET ONE HUNDRED GRAND 
THAT DAY AND I THINK J. P. MCMANUS 
HAD AN OPTION TO BUY HIM BEFORE HE 
WENT TO CLIVE SMITH 
THAT WAS 
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME RICHARD RICHARD DUNWOODY SAID YOU THOUGHT IT WAS 
THE BEST HORSE YOU'VE EVER SEEN 
THAT'S RIGHT EVEN AFTER RIDING 
DESERT ORCHID AND ALL THOSE HORSES 
BUT THE WAY HE LENGTHENED INTO THE 
STRAIGHT IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE BUT 
THE TIMING OF THAT RACE BACKS IT UP 
THEY WERE GOING SIMILAR PACE TO 
THE BUMPER 
WILL TACTICS PLAY A 
PART IN IT TODAY BECAUSE OF THE 
DISTANCE 
YES MISTER MCGOLDRICK DISTANCE HAS MADE THE RUNNING IN THE PAST 
AND TAMARINBLEU HAS DONE HE MADE 
IT IN THE BOIL'S GOLD CUP 
IF YOU 
WERE TRYING TO EXPOSE A LITTLE 
WEAKNESS AT ALL IN MASTER MINDED 
YOU WOULD HOPE IT MIGHT BE THE TRIP 
BUT HE WON A GOOD CHASE AT SANDOWN 
SO I THINK HE'LL STAY WELL ENOUGH 
VOY POR USTEDES IS THE ONLY ONE FOR 
CERTAIN WHO WON'T MAKE THE RUNNING 
HE'LL TRY AND SIT BEHIND HIM AND 
STALK HIM AND TRY AND GET PAST HIM 
YES I THINK VOY POR USTEDES ARE 
SICK THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE ON 
MASTER MINDED BUT HE IS A GOOD 
HORSE IN HIS OWN RIGHT BUT YOU 
NEVER KNOW IT'S A HORSE RACE AND 
IT'S NOT ONE HORSE RACE BECAUSE 
THESE OTHERS ARE VERY VERY GOOD 
WE'VE HAD TWO FAVOURITES BEATEN 
ALREADY TODAY HOW SHORT A PRICE IS 
FAVOURITE MASTER MANUFACTURE 
MASTER MINDED 
HE'S PRETTY SHORT WE TOUCHED ON TAX EARLIER WE TOUCHED ON TAMARINBLEU EARLIER 
AND HE'S HAD GREAT SEASON BUT HE 
HAS BEEN MORE CONCENTRATED THIS 
YEAR 
YES HE HAS BEEN RIDDEN MORE YEAR AGGRESSIVELY AS WELL OVER CHASES 
HE WAS DROPPED INTO THE RACES AND 
HE WAS A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE 
WHEN HE WON THE VICTOR CHANDLER AS 
WELL 
AND TOM SCUDAMORE IS HAVING A WELL GREAT SEASON AS WELL 
YES HE IS 
DOING WELL HIS RIDING HAS IMPROVED 
THROUGHOUT AND HE'S VERY LUCKY TO 
HAVE GREAT PEOPLE TO RIDE FOR 
MISTER MCGOLDRICK LEFT SUE SMITH 
FOR A WHILE BUT HAS NOW GONE BACK 
TO HER AS A TRAINER 
AND THERE IS 
NO ONE RIDING BETTER THAN DOMINIC 
ELSE WORTH HE'S BEEN A GREAT 
SERVANT TO SUE SMITH HE USED TO DO 
A LOT OF WINNING AROUND HAYDOCK AND 
WETHERBY WAS HIS COURSE BUT AT 
CHELTENHAM HE JUMPED FROM FENCE TO 
FENCE AND KEPT GOING AND THIS 
HORSE DOES A GOOD GALLOP DOMIC DOMIC RIDES SIMON IN TOMORROW'S GRAND 
NATIONAL NATIONAL YES SIR THIS HORSE IS COMING BACK 
TO FORM BUT IT WOULD BE A MAJOR 
SHOCK IF HE WERE TO WIN THIS THE 
JOCKEYS ARE CIRCLING AND THEY WON'T 
HANG AROUND YES A SHORT RUN TO 
THE FIRST OBSTACLE 
THEY'RE COMING IN AND THEY'RE OFF 
AND RUNNING SETTING OFF ON THE

POWER BARRY SIMPSON THERE IS 
PAUL NICHOLLS CONGRATULATING THE 
RIVAL TRAINER ALAN KING THERE IS 
VOY POR USTEDES EIGHTEEN LENGTHS AND THE 
SAME THE DISTANCES A TURNAROUND OF 
THIRTY SEVEN LENGTHS FROM THEIR MEETING AT 
CHELTENHAM IN THE QUEEN MOTHER 
CHAMPION CHASE THIS WAS OVER TWO 
AND A HALF MILES TODAY BUT IT WAS 
THAT MISTAKE AT THE SECOND LAST AND 
VOY POR USTEDES HAS BEEN A MOST 
CONSISTENT HORSE HAS CAPITALISED 
AND HAS COME HOME A VERY EASY 
WINNER WINNER YOU MAY ASK HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN 
DIFFERENT COURSE DIFFERENT DAY 
DIFFERENT PACE TO THE RACE 
DIFFERENT FENCES AS WELL MASTER 
MINDED NEVER REALLY TRAVELLING THAT 
COMFORTABLY WHEN HE STANDS OFF 
HERE HE DROPS HIS HINDQUARTERS IN 
LOSES MOMENTUM BUT A. P. MCCOY IS 
WATCHING THIS WHAT DID HE SAY TO 
YOU 
HE CAME OUT TO SAY RUBY WAS YOU RIDING THE HORSE MUCH HANDIER THAN 
HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE SO HENCE HE 
WASN'T TRAVELLING THAT WELL 
KNOWING THE WAY RUBY RIDES HE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUR OR FIVE 
LENGTHS OFF HIM AT THE CROSS FENCE 
WHETHER HE DID OR DIDN'T STAY I 
DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE WON AT 
THE CROSS FENCE L. THINK THAT HE 
OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T GIVE RUBY THE SAME 
FEELING AS HE DID AT CHELTENHAM 
THIS HORSE VOY POR USTEDES WAS 
TRAVELLING BEAUTIFULLY FOR ROBERT 
THORNTON CHOCOLATE ON BOARD ALAN 
KING THE TRAINER QUITE NICE FOR 
HIM TO BE IN FRONT HERE IS RISHI 
DELIGHTED WITH THAT SUCCESS FROM 
VOY POR USTEDES DESPITE THE 
MISTAKE OF MASTER MINDED AT THE 
SECOND TO LAST THERE WAS ALWAYS 
GOING TO BE A PROPER RACE ON MOST MOST DEFINITELY MASTER MINDED IS A 
PROPER TWO MILER AND WE HAVE ALWAYS 
FELT ALL SEASON VOY POR USTEDES 
MIGHT BE BETTER OVER FURTHER AND 
THAT IS PROVEN TODAY L. AM SO 
PLEASED FOR THE HORSE L. FELT ALL 
SEASON HE'S NEVER HAD THE CREDIT 
HE DESERVES 
YOU HAVE GONE TO A LOT 
OF RACES GOT BEATEN ONCE OR TWICE 
ONE THING THE HORSE HAS ALWAYS DONE 
IS TRY IN EVERY RACE HE HAS RUN 
EXACTLY I THINK WE HAVE PROBABLY 
BEEN ASKING HIM TO DO THE 
IMPOSSIBLE HE NEEDS THE TRIP TO 
ME HE WILL CONTINUE AT TWO AND A 
HALF AND PROBABLY KING GEORGE NEXT 
YEAR 
IT IS NICE TO GET ONE OVER YEAR PAUL NICHOLLS 
OF COURSE IT IS 
PAUL WAS THE FIRST TO COME UP AND 
SAY WELL DONE AND THAT MEANS A 
LOT I WAS FURIOUS AT NEWBURY WHEN 
I GOT BEAT PLEASED FOR THE HORSE 
GREAT SPIRIT BETWEEN THE TWO OF 
YOU 
OF COURSE THERE IS 
THEY ARE YOU GREAT RIVALS BUT ALSO GOOD FRIENDS 
AND IF YOU ASK PAUL NICHOLLS WHO HE 
THINKS IS THE MAJOR THREAT TO HIM 
AS CHAMPION IT IS OF COURSE ALAN 
KING THERE'S RUBY TALKING TO PAUL 
NICHOLLS CLIVE SMITH IN THE 
FOREGROUND THERE'S THE WINNER AT 
FIVE TO ONE VOY POR USTEDES A WINNER OF 
THE ARKLE TROPHY AND ALSO A WINNER 
OF THE QUEEN MOTHER CHAMPION CHASE 
BEATEN BY MASTER MINDED THERE IS 
SIR ROBERT OGDEN ON THE RIGHT 
LEADING IN VOY POR USTEDES CHOC 
THORNTON IN FRONT OF THIS VERY 
LARGE CROWD THERE THE WINNING 
CONNECTIONS HE'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY 
VERY CONSISTENT VOY POR USTEDES 
IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT HIS FORM 
FIGURES I DON'T THINK HE HAS EVER 
BEEN OUT OF THE PLACINGS EXCEPT FOR 
WHEN HE'S NOT COMPLETED THE COURSE 
THAT WAS AT NEWBURY IN THE GAME 
SPIRIT BUT WENT ON TO WIN AT 
CHELTENHAM AS WE ARE SEEING QUITE 
REGULARLY IT IS VERY HARD TO 
REPEAT THOSE CHELTENHAM TRIUMPHS 
HERE AT AINTREE A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
LATER WHETHER IT IS THE DIFFERENT 
COURSE OR WHETHER IT'S WHAT IT 
TAKES OUT OF HORSES AT CHELTENHAM 
THOSE DEMANDING RACES WHATEVER IT 
IS IT IS VERY VERY HARD TO WIN AT 
BOTH THESE MAJOR FESTIVALS IN THE 
ONE YEAR LET'S HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE 
FINAL FOUR FENCES FROM THE 
HELICOPTER AND YOU WILL GET GOOD 
SENSE OF HOW THE HORSES ARE 
TRAVELLING AND HOW THEY QUICKEN UP 
TAMARINBLEU IS ABOUT TO GET LEFT 
WELL BEHIND AND YOU CAN SEE RUBY 
WALSH MOVING UP ON THE OUTSIDE AND 
THIS IS YOU THOUGHT IT EARLIER 
THAN THIS A. P. THIS IS WHERE YOU 
THINK IF HE WAS TRAVELLING WELL HE 
WOULDN'T HAVE NEEDED TO DO THIS 
KNOWING RUBY HE WAS GETTING CLOSE 
ENOUGH ON A HORSE THAT WAS THAT 
IMPRESSIVE LAST TIME THAT HE 
OBVIOUSLY HAD A SLIGHT WORRY THAT 
HE WASN'T GOING THAT WELL HE 
DIDN'T WANT TO BE LETTING VOY POR 
USTEDES OUT OF HIS REACH RUBY SAID 
HE DIDN'T STAY AND HE PROBABLY 
DIDN'T I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS 
TRAVELLING AS WELL EVEN JUST AFTER 
TWO MILES TODAY SO HE WAS WELL BEAT 
FROM THE LAST DITCH 
WE CAN SEE 
VERY CLEARLY HOW VOY POR USTEDES 
QUICKENS AWAY FROM THAT SECOND LAST 
I KNOW MASTER MINDED MADE A MISTAKE 
BUT VOY POR USTEDES IS PRETTY 
IMPRESSIVE 
HE'S MADE A MISTAKE IMPRESSIVE MASTER MINDED AT THE SECOND LAST 
IT'S STOPPED HIS MOMENTUM L. THINK 
SOMETIMES HORSES THAT COME OVER 
FROM FRANCE CAN PEAK AND THEY CAN 
GO OFF VERY QUICKLY AS WELL L. KNOW 
HE PROBABLY HASN'T GOT THE TRIP AS 
WELL SO CERTAINLY RUN WELL BELOW 
HIS FORM 
LET'S PAY CREDIT TO VOY 
POR USTEDES ALAN KING WATCHING 
HE'S A HORSE THAT'S WON HIM A 
CHAMPION CHASE BEFORE DESERVES A 
VICTORY IN ANOTHER GRADE ONE HE IS 
ONCE AGAIN THE CHAMP 
YOU LIKE WATCHING YOUR BOSS GETTING 
A BIT REVVED UP 
GOOD TO SEE HE IS 
VERY PASSIONATE AND HE SHOWED IT 
THERE 
YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT YOU THERE WOULD TURN THE TABLES WITH MASTER 
MINDED 
YOU ARE CONFIDENT MINDED HOPEFULLY IF HE DIDN'T GET THE 
TRIP WE WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE 
THERE'S GOING TO BE EXCUSES FROM 
MASTER MINDED BUT WE HAVE TOOK 
ADVANTAGE 
HE JUMPED SUPER COULD ADVANTAGE THIS BE HIS BEST TRIP BETTER THAN 
TWO 
IT COULD WELL BE HE'S A BIT TWO OLDER NOW BUT TODAY WITH THE 
GROUND IT'S THE FIRST TIME HE 
JUMPED VERY WELL TODAY L. MISSED 
THE CROSS FENCE AND THAT WAS ALL 
HE FELT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE 
PAK JACK IN THE NEXT HE IS WELL 
FANCIED 
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT ALL FANCIED THE BOYS TELL ME HE IS A GOOD RIDE 
HOPEFULLY I WILL GET A GOOD RIDE 
WELL DONE 
THANK YOU 
I HAVE SPOKEN TO PAUL NICHOLLS AND 
RUBY WALSH ABOUT MAMMA MIA RUBY 
WALSH SAID HE DIDN'T STAY AND I 
SPOKE TO PAUL NICHOLLS AFTER THE 
RACE RUBY WALSH ABOUT MASTER 
MINDED HE WAS RUNNING ON EMPTY AND 
HE WOULDN'T GET HOME OVER TWO AND 
A HALF MILES SO NO EXCUSES FOR 
MASTER MINDED OTHER THAN HE DIDN'T 
STAY THE TRIP TODAY L. SPOKE TO TOM 
SCUDAMORE WHO RODE TAMARINBLEU AND 
HE SAID HE RAN A TERRIFIC RACE 
JUST BEATEN BY TWO OUTSTANDING 
HORSES HORSES THE VERY IMPRESSIVE VOY POR USTEDES 
WINS AT FIVE TO ONE ALLFIRST T. THREE FAVOURITES ALL 
BEATEN IF YOU ALL FIRST THREE 
FAVOURITES ALL BEATEN ANDREW THORNTON HAS BEEN WITH US 
FOR TWO DAYS WE WILL BE SAYING 
GOODBYE IN A MINUTE WANT HIS 
OPINION ON THIS THE BIG CHANGING 
POINT IT WAS TWO AND A HALF MILES 
WAS THE SECOND LAST THIS HORSE 
STANDS OFF AS FAR AS I HAVE EVER 
SEEN A HORSE 
EXACTLY THE PETROL 
WAS RUNNING OUT AT THIS STAGE HE'S 
JUST ABOUT THE HIT THE BRICK WALL 
IF HE HAD STAYED THE TRIP HE WOULD 
HAVE CLEARED THAT FENCE IT WAS THE 
FACT THAT THE HORSE IS JUST 
STARTING TO GET TIRED AND NOW CHOC 
HAS GOT HIM BEAT VOY POR USTEDES 
STAYED A LOT BETTER IT IS GREAT TO 
SEE TWO GREAT HORSES COMING BACK 
AND TAKING EACH OTHER ON AGAIN 
AFTER CHELTENHAM 
AT CHELTENHAM 
THE WINNER THE WINNER HERE LET'S 
LOOK AT THIS OH THAT IS 
INCREDIBLE I THINK THE HORSE 
WINDED HIMSELF WHEN HE LANDED L. 
KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU HE PROBABLY 
DIDN'T STAY L. FEEL THE EFFORT OF 
THAT AND STUMBLING ON THE LANDING 
HE WINDED HIMSELF 
HE MAY WELL HAVE 
DONE I FEEL GOING TO THE FENCE 
RUBY WAS GETTING ANIMATED HE 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELLING ALL 
OVER THE OTHER HORSE HE BLATANTLY 
HASN'T GOT HOME VOY POR USTEDES 
HAS ENJOYED EVERY INCH OF STEPPING 
UP FROM TWO MILES TO TWO AND A HALF 
LET'S HOPE THEY COME BACK NEXT YEAR 
LET'S HOPE WE SEE YOU COME BACK 
TOMORROW VOY POR USTEDES WAS 
FAVOURITE TO WIN THE CHAMPION CHASE 
AT CHELTENHAM AND IT WAS NINETEEN LENGTHS 
TURNAROUND PLUS TODAY'S DISTANCE

ROBERT OGDEN AND ALAN KING ROBERT 
THORNTON GETTING A HUGE ROUND OF 
APPLAUSE AND GREAT TRIUMPH FOR 
THEM AND THAT TROPHY PRESENTATION 
BEING MADE BY THE SALES DIRECTOR 
FOR JOHN SMITH'S L. HAVE A QUESTION FOR RICHARD DUNWOODY IN THE LAST 
THIRTY YEARS HOW MANY CHAMPION JOCKEYS 
HAVE WON 
NATIONAL NOT 
NOT TOO MANY CLARE

I SUPPOSE THAT MUST BE MYSELF THAT THAT IS YOU JONJO O'NEILL DIDN'T PETER 
SCUDAMORE DIDN'T JOHN FRANCOME 
DIDN'T AND THE CHAMPION JOCKEY FOR 
THE LAST TWELVE YEARS HAS BEEN A. P. MCCOY 
AND HE HAS YET TO WIN IT RICHARD

CHECK THE RUNNERS AND RIDERS FOR 
THIS RACE THIS TWO MILE HURDLE 
IT'S THE LITTLEWOODS DIRECT IMAGINE 
APPEAL TOP NOVICES' HURDLE THEY ARE THE RUNNERS FOURTEEN OF THEM

FELLA HADN'T RAN FROM NOVEMBER HE 
LOOKED LIKE HE WOULD IMPROVE BIT 
HE WAS QUICK ENOUGH TO WIN OVER 
MILE AND A HALF LAST SUMMER ON 
QUICK GROUND HE HAS PLENTY OF PACE 
I KNOW TONY MCCOY IS LOOKING 
FORWARD TO RIDING HIM 
WE HAVE TO 
POINT OUT TONY MCCOY DIDN'T RIDE

CHOSE TO RIDE BINOCULAR THERE ARE 
OTHER HORSES IN HERE WHO COME IN 
WITH A BIG CHANCE AND THIS IS ONE 
OF THEM PIERROT LUNAIRE HAS FORM 
WITH BINOCULAR SO THAT TIES IN 
WITH CAPTAIN CEE BEE AND YOU HAVE 
TO REMEMBER THIS IS ONLY A FOUR 
YEAR OLD THERE ARE THREE FOUR 
YEAR OLDS IN THIS RACE SO HE GETS A 
WEIGHT ALLOWANCE 
A GREAT WEIGHT 
ALLOWANCE FOR PIERROT LUNAIRE AND 
RUBY WALSH RUBY HACKING DOWN THERE 
HE IS LIKE HE IS GOING OFF HUNTING 
ONLY A FOUR YEAR OLD A CRACKING 
RUN AGAIN WITH BINOCULAR AT KEMPTON 
JUST GOT BEAT BY BINOCULAR 
BINOCULAR HAS PROBABLY IMPROVED A 
LOT SINCE THEN THIS FELLA IS A 
GOOD TOUGH HORSE 
THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT RUBY DOES THAT MOST DON'T DO

FOR PEOPLE AT HOME THAT ARE 
THINKING WHAT'S HE DOING HORSES

CHAMPION HURDLER

HE HAS WORKED WITH CELESTIAL HALO 
THE FORM WITH BINOCULAR AND HE IS 
ON A ROLL 
YOU ARE ON A ROLL IT'S IT'S GREAT WE HAVE LEARNT A BIT WITH A 
FEW OF THEM 
HOW HARD IS IT TO KEEP 
THE HORSES GOING FROM WAY BACK IN 
SEPTEMBER SLASH OCTOBER TO NOW IN APRIL 
A GREAT TEAM EFFORT AND A LOT OF 
HARD WORK HORSES ALWAYS RUN WELL 
IN THE SPRING WHEN IT WARMS UP SO 
LONG MAY IT LAST

RUBY WALSH THIS AFTERNOON TONY

WHEN WINNING AT CHELTENHAM HERE 
THEY ARE COMING BACK UP TO THE

ENJOYING EVERY MOMENT OF IT 
MILKING IT IT REALLY HAS BEEN A GREAT 
AFTERNOON FOR THIS PIERROT LUNAIRE 
WHO IS A FOUR YEAR OLD CARRIED TEN 
STONE EIGHT TODAY SO GETTING A 
SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT ALLOWANCE A 
GOOD PROSPECT THERE IS NO DOUBT 
HIS JUMPING HAS REALLY IMPROVED 
FOR RUBY IT IS HIS SIXTIETH WINNER IN 
BRITAIN THIS YEAR HE HAS RIDDEN A 
STACK OF WINNERS IN IRELAND AS WELL 
IT IS PAUL NICHOLLS' ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOURTH AND YET 
MORE PRIZE MONEY HE IS CAREERING 
THROUGH THAT THREE MILLION BARRIER 
HE'S ABSOLUTELY UNSTOPPABLE AT THE 
MOMENT ONLY A FEW SEASONS AGO IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY RESPECTABLE ON 
THE FLAT SO A BIG PERFORMANCE 
LET'S CHECK THE RESULT NOW FOR THIS 
LITTLEWOODS DIRECT IMAGINE APPEAL 
TOP NOVICES' HURDLE WITH JOHN 
ANOTHER TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSIVE 
PERFORMANCE FROM NICHOLLS AND WALSH IF YOU FANCY THAT HORSE FOR NEXT 
YEAR'S CHAMPION HURDLE HE IS SIXTEEN TO ONE 
WITH HILLS 
HERE IS THAT MOMENT 
WHERE THE WINNING CONNECTIONS HAVE 
THEIR PHOTO AS SOON AS HE IS 
FINISHED RUBY WILL REFLECT ON 
WHAT'S BEEN ANOTHER MAGNIFICENT DAY 
FOR HIM AND THE PAUL NICHOLLS' TEAM 
RUBY REFLECT ON WHAT HAS BEEN A 
REALLY FANTASTIC DAY L. L. KNOW MASTER 
MINDED GOT BEAT IT'S BEEN ANOTHER 
GREAT DAY 
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE 
THOUGHT MASTER MINDED WOULD HAVE 
BEEN THE ONE THAT GOT BEAT REALLY 
GUTSY 
HIS JUMPING WAS REALLY GOOD GUTSY A SMASHING LITTLE HORSE 
WELL DONE 
THANKS AN EASY VICTORY FOR THE FOUR YEAR 
OLD HE ONLY HAD TEN STONE EIGHT NOW 
WHAT NORMAN AND I WANT TO DO HERE 
IS TO SEE EXACTLY HOW CARBERRY 
STOLE TEN LENGTHS AT THE START HE 
IS ON THE GREY HORSE THIS IS 
MARSAM WATCH HIM HE IS IN THE 
YELLOW COLOURS THE HORSE LOOKING 
TOWARDS US BUT JUST SEE THEY ARE 
WAITING FOR LAZY DARREN TO COME IN 
BINGO TEN LENGTHS 
BY THE TIME HE 
GETS TO THE FIRST HURDLE HE IS TWELVE 
LENGTHS CLEAR THIS IS WHERE WE 
LOSE PIGEON ISLAND HE'S BEEN SUCH 
A BRAVE HORSE ALL SEASON SORRY TO 
SEE HIM HAVE A NASTY FALL L. 
BELIEVE HE GOT UP O. K. SO DID PADDY 
BRENNAN MARSAM GOING ALONG THE 
GREY HORSE IN THE GREEN COLOURS 
BEHIND THE WHITE CAP IN THE MIDDLE 
THERE HE GOES STOOD A LONG WAY OFF 
THE HURDLE CAUGHT THE TOP OF IT 
HORSE JUMPED UP REAL QUICK THEN 
AROUND INTO THE STRAIGHT SALFORD 
CITY AND NINA CARBERRY IN FRONT 
TONY MCCOY PUSHING ALONG CAPTAIN 
CEE BEE ON THE OUTSIDE HE'S FLAT 
FROM CHELTENHAM THIS IS DOWN TO 
THE SECOND LAST 
IT CERTAINLY IS 
WHAT IS SO IMPRESSIVE ABOUT THIS 
YOUNG HORSE HE SONL FOUR IS THE 
AMOUNT OF SPEED THAT HE SHOWED AND 
HOW QUICKLY THE GAP ELONGATED 
BETWEEN THEM THE OTHER FOUR YEAR 
OLD LAZY DARREN IN THE LIGHT 
COLOURS TONY DOBBIN RETIRING NEXT 
THURSDAY BATTLES TO BE THIRD LOOK 
HOW THAT GAP OPENS 
A BIG WEIGHT 
DIFFERENCE A DECISION BY PAUL 
NICHOLLS TO MISS CHELTENHAM WITH 
THIS HORSE AIMING FOR HERE A 
REALLY GOOD PERFORMANCE L. THOUGHT 
BINOCULAR IMPROVED A LOT AFTER 
KEMPTON BUT MAYBE THIS FELLA HAS 
ALSO IMPROVED THERE IS THE FACE OF 
A VERY HAPPY MAN

THINKING ABOUT HIS TEN PER CENT AT ALL 
THERE IS PADDY BRENNAN PIGEON

FALL ON CROZAN RODE KHYBER KIM AND 
THE WHOLE OF HIS FACE IS HORRID
