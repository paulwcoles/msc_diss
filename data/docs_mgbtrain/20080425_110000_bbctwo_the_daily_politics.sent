POLITICS ON FRIDAY MOTORISTS ARE 
ASKED NOT TO PANIC BUY PETROL IN 
SCOTLAND AS A STRIKE AT THE 
GRANGEMOUTH OIL REFINERY FORCES B. P. 
TO BEGIN SHUTTING DOWN A CRUCIAL 
NORTH SEA PIPELINE THE ENERGY 
MINISTER JOINS US LIVE 
ALSO TODAY WITH LESS THAN A WEEK 
TO GO BEFORE THE LOCAL ELECTIONS WE 
HAVE THE LATEST IN OUR SERIES OF 
INTERVIEWS WITH THE PARTIES TODAY 
THE GREENS ARE IN THE DAILY 
POLITICS SIGHTS 
WE REPORT FROM THE NORFOLK BROADS 
ON A POSSIBLE PLAN TO COPE WITH THE 
EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE BY 
ABANDONING MUCH OF THE NATIONAL 
PARK TO THE RISING SEA 
AT THE END OF A PUNISHING WEEK FOR 
THE PRIME MINISTER WE ASK HOW 
GORDON BROWN CAN BOUNCE BACK ONE 
POLL PUBLISHED TODAY PUTS LABOUR EIGHTEEN 
POINTS BEHIND THE TORIES 
OF COURSE GILES WILL HAVE ALL THE 
TOP STORIES OF THE WEEK IN OUR 
POLITICAL POPS 
WITH ME TODAY ARE SOME DAILY 
POLITICS REGULARS ZOE WILLIAMS OF 
THE GUARDIAN AND THE BROADCASTER 
NICK FERRARI WELCOME LET'S KICK 
OFF WITH OUR TOP STORY TODAY WHICH 
IS THE STRIKE AT GRANGEMOUTH OIL 
REFINERY THE ACTION OVER PENSIONS 
IS DUE TO START ON SUNDAY BUT IT'S 
ALREADY CAUSING HEADACHES NORTH OF 
THE BORDER THIS MORNING B. P. 
CONFIRMED THAT IT WOULD SHUT DOWN A 
NORTH SEA PIPELINE IF THE STRIKE 
GOES AHEAD THE S. N. P. GOVERNMENT IN 
SCOTLAND INSISTS THAT THERE IS 
AMPLE AND SUFFICIENT PETROL AND 
DIESEL STOCKS IT IS ASKING 
MOTORISTS TO AVOID PANIC BUYING AT 
PETROL STATIONS I HAVE BEEN 
SPEAKING TO THE B. B. C.'S FIONA TROTT 
I ASKED HER TO EXPLAIN FIRST WHAT 
EFFECT THE STRIKE IS HAVING WELL WELL YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD TODAY BY 
THAT MASSIVE DECISION THAT WAS MADE 
BY B. P. TO CLOSE THE PIPELINE WHICH 
BRINGS AT LEAST A THIRD OF 
BRITAIN'S OIL FROM OUT IN THE NORTH 
SEA BRINGING THAT ASHORE THEY ARE 
HAVING TO DO THAT BECAUSE 
GRANGEMOUTH CAN'T SUPPLY IT WITH 
THE ELECTRICITY AND STEAM IT NEEDS 
TO PROCESS THAT OIL THAT WILL COST 
THE ECONOMY FIFTY MILLION A DAY ON 
THE ROAD WE ARE HEARING FROM 
PEOPLE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY THAT PETROL PRICES ARE 
AVERAGING ONE POINT ONE OH PER LITRE HERE 
TODAY WE HEARD IN ORKNEY THAT 
SOMEBODY HAS HAD TO PAY ONE POINT THREE OH A 
LITRE FOR DIESEL 
WHAT IS THE S. N. P. 
SAYING ABOUT THIS IT IS SOMETHING 
OF A CHALLENGE FOR THEM TO DEAL 
WITH 
FUNNILY ENOUGH ON MONDAY WITH THE S. N. P. ARE DUE TO RAISE THE ISSUE 
OF OIL PRICES IN WESTMINSTER IT 
WANTS AN AMENDMENT TO THE FINANCE 
BILL SO IF OIL PRICES GO ABOVE THE 
BENCHMARK LEVEL THEY WANT THAT TO 
BE OFFSET BY FUEL DUTY THE FIRST 
MINISTER IS ALREADY ENCOURAGING 
PEOPLE TO TRY AND GET BACK AROUND 
THE TABLE TO AVOID THIS STRIKE RAISING THIS ISSUE OF THE COST 
ARE RAISING THIS ISSUE OF THE COST OF PETROL IN WESTMINSTER ON MONDAY 
THEY ARE PLANNING AN AMENDMENT TO 
THE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCE BILL THE 
BUDGET LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD TRY 
TO FIX THE PRICE OF PETROL BY 
ENSURING THAT ANY INCREASES IN THE 
COST OF A BARREL OF OIL WOULD BE 
OFFSET BY THE REDUCTION OF THE FUEL 
TAX IT LOOKS LIKE THE HIGH COST OF 
PETROL IS MOVING RAPIDLY UP THE 
POLITICAL AGENDA ON TUESDAY THE 
PROTESTERS FROM THE FUEL BLOCKADE 
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ARE GOING TO BE 
DRIVING IN A CONVOY OF TRUCKS TO 
WESTMINSTER TO VOICE THEIR ANGER AT 
THE PRICES AT THE PUMPS EIGHT 
YEARS AGO WHEN THAT LAST FUEL 
PROTEST TOOK PLACE THE COST OF A 
LITRE OF UNLEADED FUEL WAS EIGHTY TWO P. NOW 
SIT ONE POINT OH NINE SIXTY FIVE P. OF THAT OR FIFTY NINE PER CENT IS 
MADE UP OF TAXES THAT IS SIXTEEN PER CENT FOR 
VAT AND FORTY EIGHT P. FOR FUEL DUTY AND THIS 
IS SET TO RISE OF COURSE FURTHER IN 
THE AUTUMN WHEN ANOTHER TWO P. OF DUTY 
IS ADDED IN OCTOBER SO IS THE 
PRICE OF PETROL GOING TO BE THE 
NEXT HEADACHE FOR GORDON BROWN WE 
HAVE BEEN JOINED BY THE ENERGY 
MINISTER MALCOLM WICKS WE WILL 
GET ON TO THAT QUESTION IN MOMENT 
FIRST THE GRANGEMOUTH STRIKE AND B. P. 
CONFIRMING SIT GOING TO START 
SHUTTING DOWN ITS PIPELINE WHICH 
TAKES OIL FROM THE PLATFORMS TO THE 
REFINERY THAT IS GOING TO HAVE A 
MAJOR IMPACT A THIRD OF THE U. K.'S 
OIL 
THIS 
IS A SERIOUS ISSUE THERE OIL IS STILL ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO GO 
BEFORE THE FINAL DECISION HAS TO BE 
MADE TO CLOSE DOWN THE PIPELINE TO 
THE NORTH SEA WHAT WE ARE SAYING 
OF COURSE WE ARE AT ONE WITH THE 
SCOTTISH EXECUTIVE ON THIS IS THE 
TWO SIDES WHO ARE HAVING A 
DISCUSSION AN ARGUMENT ABOUT 
PENSIONS HAVE GOT TO RETURN TO THE 
NEGOTIATING TABLE ACAS ARE THERE 
TO ACT AS UMPIRE AND WE HOPE TO SEE 
THIS RESOLVED AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE 
DO YOU HAVE SYMPATHY WITH POSSIBLE THE STRIKERS 
NO I UNDERSTAND THE 
ISSUE OF PENSIONS L. WANT TO MAKE 
SURE ENERGY CONTINUES TO FLOW THAT 
IS WHY WE WANT NEGOTIATIONS AND A 
SETTLEMENT WHAT I DO WANT TO DO 
HOWEVER IS ASSURE PEOPLE THAT 
ACTUALLY DESPITE THIS THERE IS NOT 
A BIG PROBLEM ABOUT SUPPLY EITHER 
OF GAS OR OIL OR PETROL WE HAVE 
ALREADY ENACTED AS FROM MONDAY A 
NATIONAL AGREEMENT WE HAVE WITH ALL 
THE OIL COMPANIES TO MAKE SURE 
THERE IS ADEQUATE SUPPLY IN 
SCOTLAND O. K. IN AN INDIVIDUAL 
GARAGE A FORECOURT THERE MAY BE 
IT MAY RUN OUT FOR A FEW HOURS 
THERE WILL BE PROBLEMS 
YOU CAN'T 
GUARANTEE TO MOTORISTS THAT THEY 
WILL BE ABLE TO GET PETROL IT IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO THINK THE 
GOVERNMENT CAN GUARANTEE EVERY 
FORECOURT ALWAYS HAS THE PETROL 
WHEN YOU WANT IT IT IS NOT A 
QUESTION OF SUPPLY IT IS MORE A 
QUESTION OF LOGISTICS IF PEOPLE DO 
PANIC BUY OF COURSE IT WOULD BE 
SILLY IF THEY DID A FORECOURT 
MIGHT RUN OUT THERE IS THE SUPPLY 
THERE THERE IS NOT A SUPPLY 
PROBLEM IN BRITAIN 
IF THE STRIKE 
IS OVER WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS 
THEN YOU ARE HAPPY YOU ARE HAPPY 
THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO SEE A 
REPEAT OF WHAT HAPPENED EIGHT YEARS 
AGO WHEN PEOPLE WERE QUEUING UP AT 
PETROL STATIONS 
I DON'T THINK WE 
ARE IN THAT SITUATION IT IS A VERY 
COMPLEX PLANT AT GRANGEMOUTH A 
SERIES OF PLANTS AFTER A COUPLE OF 
DAYS YOU CAN'T JUST TURN THE SWITCH 
ON TUESDAY MORNING AND ALL IS UP 
AND RUNNING WHICH IS WHY WE ARE 
URGING THE TWO SIDES TO GET 
TOGETHER AND COME TO A SENSIBLE 
AGREEMENT ABOUT THE DISPUTE BEFORE 
THEM 
THIS IS FEEDING INTO A TIME THEM WHEN WE ARE ALREADY SEEING 
EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES FOR PETROL AT 
THE PUMPS LAST TIME THERE WAS A 
FUEL BLOCKADE PRICES WERE EIGHTY TWO P. A 
LITRE NOW THEY ARE ONE POINT OH NINE A LITRE 
THIS IS FUEL TO THE FIRE TO 
PROTESTERS 
YES IT'S A DIFFICULT PROTESTERS ISSUE I WISH THAT OIL PRICES WERE 
LOWER THAN THEY ARE YOU HAVE TO 
UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT THIS IS A 
GLOBAL ISSUE IT IS NOT JUST 
HAPPENING IN BRITAIN OR JUST IN 
EUROPE THERE IS A HUGE GLOBAL GRAB 
FOR ENERGY GOING ON BECAUSE OF THE 
GREAT ECONOMIES OF CHINA AND INDIA 
REALLY MOVING THEY NEED MORE 
ENERGY THE PRICE OF A BARREL OF 
OIL WHEN TWO YEARS AGO I TALKED 
ABOUT A PSYCHOLOGICAL BARRIER SEVENTY DOLLARS 
FOR A BARREL NOW IT IS ALMOST 
APPROACHING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS 
I DON'T SUPPOSE 
MOTORISTS CARE WHY IT IS HAPPENING 
WHETHER IT IS GLOBALLY OR NOT THEY 
ARE PAYING A LOT MORE AT THE PETROL 
PUMP AND THAT IS DOWN TO TAXES 
WILL YOU CONSIDER DELAYING THAT 
EXTRA INCREASE IN FUEL DUTY IN THE 
AUTUMN 
YOU SAY THEY DON'T CARE AUTUMN THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT ARE 
THE FACTORS BEHIND THIS BECAUSE WE 
NEED TO MAKE AN INTELLIGENT 
ASSESSMENT OF THIS L. THINK WHAT 
THE S. N. P. ARE SAYING IS THAT SOMEHOW 
YOU ARE ALWAYS ADJUSTING THE TAX 
WITH THE RISING PRICE THAT IS NOT 
THE REAL WORLD IF ONE DAY IT IS 
SEVENTY DOLLARS AND THE NEXT DAY IT IS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS 
THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE 
CONSUMER I'M NOT A TAX MINISTER 
I'M NOT FROM THE TREASURY THE THE NSP'S PROPOSAL IS NOT FOR THE REAL 
THE SNP'S PROPOSAL IS NOT FOR THE 
REAL WORLD WOULD YOU AGREE WE WE HAVE THE MOST EXPENSIVE PETROL IN 
THE WHOLE OF THE WORLD HOW COME 
IT IS CHEAPER IN EUROPE WHY IS 
THAT 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT TAX THAT REGIMES IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WE WE PAY THE MOST THAT IS WHY THE S. N. P. 
IDEA HAS SOME MERIT THERE ARE 
PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS A CAR IS NOT 
A LUXURY THEY HAVE TO GO POST 
OFFICES ARE BEING CLOSED THE ONLY 
WAY THE OLD FOLK CAN GET THEIR 
PENSIONS IS TO GET INTO A CAR I I ALSO NOTICED THAT SOME OF THESE 
SAME PEOPLE INCLUDING THE S. N. P. 
BECAUSE I HEAR THEM IN WESTMINSTER 
WANT US TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON THIS 
IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SERVICES TAX 
REVENUES ARE TO PAY FOR PUBLIC 
SERVICES 
WHY SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT SERVICES BENEFIT FROM OIL PRICES GOING UP 
IF THE S. N. P. COME ALONG WITH THEIR 
PROPOSALS ABOUT REDUCTIONS FOR 
HEALTH SERVICES OR SCHOOLS NO NO WHY SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT BENEFIT 
FROM OIL PRICES GOING UP 
BECAUSE A 
TAX IS ON A PRICE OR IT'S AN AN 
INCOME 
YOU HAVE ALREADY GOT YOUR INCOME TAX 
ZOE I WOULD LIKE TO GET YOU TAX YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHAT PUBLIC 
SERVICES YOU WANT TO CUT BY THE WAY 
ONLY IN THE OIL 
IT WOULD MAKE A 
MOCKERY TO REDUCE OUR ENERGY USAGE 
IF THE FIRST THING WE ARE GOING TO 
DO IS TAKE THE TAX OFF THE PETROL 
THAT IS RIDICULOUS 
I'M TALKING 
ABOUT INCREASING WHY SHOULD THE 
GOVERNMENT TAKE INCREASES WHEN 
PETROL GOES UP 
THE GOVERNMENT 
TAXES IT ALL PARTIES SAID WE 
WILL TAX PETROL AT THIS RATE IT IT IS LIKE SIXTY FIVE P. IN EVERY LITRE NOT NOT ONLY DO WE USE THAT MONEY FOR 
PUBLIC SERVICES THIS IS MEANT TO 
BE A. 
WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME 
THE FINAL WORD TO YOU 
ONE WAY TO 
SQUARE THIS CIRCLE IS TO BRING ON 
FORMS OF TRANSPORT LIKE THE HYBRID 
CAR SO WE CAN USE OUR MOTOR CARS AS 
MUCH AS WE WANT BUT WITHOUT ALWAYS 
CONSUMING THE OIL AND THE PETROL 
THAT COSTS SO MUCH THIS RISING 
PRICE IS GOING TO BRING FORWARD 
THOSE TECHNOLOGIES THAT IS THE WAY 
IN WHICH YOUR TWO GUESTS MAY START 
TO AGREE ON SOMETHING 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US 
THANK YOU 
LATER THIS YEAR THE GOVERNMENT 
WILL RECEIVE A REPORT FROM NATURAL 
ENGLAND THE BODY THAT'S CHARGED 
WITH LOOKING AFTER ENGLAND'S 
COUNTRYSIDE THAT REPORT IS LOOKING 
AT THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON 
OUR COASTAL AREAS AND THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT BEAUTY SPOTS LIKE 
THE NORFOLK BROADS MIGHT BE LOST TO 
THE RISING SEA ONE OPTION IS TO 
COMPLETELY ABANDON A SECTION OF 
THAT COASTLINE AND MOVE THE SEA 
DEFENCES FURTHER INLAND THAT IS A 
MOVE WHICH HAS ALREADY SPURRED THE 
HEAD OF BRITAIN'S ARMY TO SAY THAT 
HE WON'T GIVE UP THE BROADS WITHOUT 
A FIGHT GILES HAS GOT HIS FEET WET 
BY WADING IN THE SEA HAS IMMENSE 
POWER IT CAN SHRED WOOD AND METAL 
CLAW AWAY HOMES AND BUILDINGS EVEN 
AT PEACE IT CAN SEEP INLAND 
COMBINING THAT WITH AN INEXORABLE 
RISE IN SEA LEVEL NATURAL ENGLAND 
HAS DRAWN UP FOUR PLANS FOR THE 
FUTURE OF ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S 
BIGGEST NATURAL ATTRACTIONS T. 
NORFOLK BROADS 
WE ARE BEHAVING 
RESPONSIBLY BY TRYING TO ASSESS 
WHAT THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGES 
WILL BE ON THE BROADS THEN TRYING 
TO ESTABLISH HOW BEST WE COULD COPE 
WITH THE BIG IMPACT THAT CLIMATE 
CHANGE POSES 
RESPONSIBLE OR NOT 
TWO OF THE PLANS HAVE PROVOKED A 
FIERCE LOCAL REACTION ONE IS TO DO 
NOTHING ABOUT THE DILAPIDATED 
COASTAL DEFENCES OR TWO ARGUABLY 
MORE CONTROVERSIAL A PLANNED 
ABANDONMENT OR EMBAYMENT OF TWENTY FIVE 
SQUARE MILES TO THE SEA AN AREA 
CONTAINING HUNDREDS OF HOMES SIX 
VILLAGES FIVE CHURCHES FOUR FRESH 
WATER LAKES AND A MARSH HARRIER IN 
A REED BED 
THESE BROAD ALSO CHANGE 
AND THEY WILL CHANGE FOREVER WE 
CAN'T MAINTAIN THEM AS THEY ARE WE 
COULD BE SEEING UP TO JUST SHORT OF 
A METRE RISE IN SEE LEVEL 
UNPRECEDENTED IN RECENT HISTORY OR 
POSSIBLY IN HUMAN HISTORY EVERYONE EVERYONE KNOW IT IS STORY OF THE KING WHO 
TRIED TO STOP THE WAVES BUT OVER 
HISTORY THE POINT OF HIS ACTION 
HAVE BEEN LOST HE WAS TRYING TO 
PROVE THAT EVEN BEING THE MOST 
POWERFUL MAN IN THE LAND HE 
COULDN'T CONTROL NATURE NATURAL 
ENGLAND SAY THE POINT OF THEIR 
RESEARCH IS TO DO EXACTLY THE SAME 
EQUALLY THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE PLACE 
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE STRENGTH OF 
FEEL F. G. YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE FOR 
WHOM THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY IN THE 
LAND IS SAYING IT COULD BE 
ABANDONED TO BEING UNDER WATER IF 
THEIR GRAND CHILDREN WANT TO ENJOY 
IT THEY MAY NEED TO BRING A PAIR OF 
THESE 
THIS IS PURELY POLITICS AT THESE WORK TO SAY THAT IT IS NOT 
POSSIBLE TO DEFEND TO DEFEND AN 
AREA FROM THE SEA SIMPLY IS NOT 
TRUE SOMEONE IN WESTMINSTER WILL 
MAKE THE DECISION THAT THE 
BUSINESSES FARMS HOMES AND 
ECOSYSTEMS UP THERE AREN'T WORTH 
SAVING AND THAT'S THE DECISION 
WHICH WILL BE MADE IT WILL BE A 
FINANCIAL ONE 
MONEY IS KEY 
NATURAL ENGLAND'S EMBAYMENT PLAN IS 
ACCUSED OF BLIGHTING HOUSE AND LAND 
VALUES GOVERNMENTS USE A NINETEEN FORTY NINE ACT 
WHICH ABSOLVES THEM FROM 
COMPENSATING FOR LOSS TO THE SEA 
LOCALS FEEL THEY ARE EXPENDABLE 
THERE ARE PLACES IN THE COUNTRY 
THAT HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS THE 
FACT THAT IT'S FAIRLY SMALL PIECE 
OF NORFOLK WITHOUT TOO MANY VOTERS 
MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT 
WHAT IS AN ACCEPTABLE PRICE TO PAY 
FOR SEA DEFENCE 
WHAT'S AN 
ACCEPTABLE PRICE TO SAY FOR A SICK 
BANK WHAT IS AN ACCEPTABLE PRICE 
TO PAY FOR AFGHANISTAN OR IRAN OR 
IRAQ IT'S A POLITICAL DECISION 
FORTUNATELY I'M A BOATBUILDER SOON SOON SOMEONE WILL MAKE THE DECISION AND 
NOT JUST OVER NORFOLK WHAT THEY 
DECIDE MIGHT DETERMINE THE NUMBER 
OF THE FIRST CLIMATE CHANGE REFUGEES REFUGEES GILES DILNOT ZOE AND NICK WERE 
WATCHING THAT FILM ZOE AS ROBIN 
RICHARDSON THERE SAID THIS IS 
PURELY A POLITICAL DECISION WOULD 
YOU AGREE 
ONLY IN SO FAR AS 
EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE IN THE END 
IF YOU ARE GOING TO SAY WE CAN 
THROW ANY MONEY IN THE WORLD AT 
THIS IT CAN BE SOLVED 
EVERYTHING'S GOT A FINITE AMOUNT OF 
MONEY 
DO YOU THINK IT IS WORTH MONEY SAVING AT ANY PRICE 
WE HAVE TO DO 
MORE IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THE 
GOVERNMENT ARE RELYING ON A PIECE 
OF LEGISLATION THAT WAS BROUGHT IN 
AFTER WORLD WAR TWO TO MAKE SURE 
THESE PEOPLE GET NOTHING AS THEIR 
HOUSES THEIR BUSINESSES SLIDE INTO 
THE 
WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS THE DEFENDING THE LAND WHICH WILL BE 
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE IN COMPENSATING 
THERE MUST BE A WAY OF DOING THIS 
HAVEN'T THE DUTCH BEEN DOING THIS 
FOR YEARS 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A METRE AND A 
METRE AND A HALF HERE 
IF THE SEA 
LEVEL IS RISING THERE IS NO POINT 
STAMPING YOUR FEET SAYING I WON'T 
HAVE IT 
I CAN EMPHASISE WITH THAT 
HE SEES ALL THE MONEY SPENT ON 
AFGHANISTAN IRAQ MEANWHILE THERE 
IS HIM AND HIS BUSINESS PRO RA TA 
IT IS NOT MUCH MONEY BUT AT ANY 
PRICE THESE ARE THESE PEOPLE'S 
LIVELIHOODS THEIR LIVES 
THAT IS 
ONE PART OF VERY LARGE COASTLINE 
PRESUMABLY THIS THING IS HAPPENING 
ALL THE WAY ALONG THE COAST F. YOU 
DO IT FOR NORFOLK WHERE DOES THE 
BILL END 
IT GOES ON FOR EVER AND 
EVER YOU ARE RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT 
KING CANUTE YOU HAVE TO TRY 
ANYTHING ANYBODY ANYONE WHO HAS 
KIDS GO INTO MARINE CONSTRUCTION 
YOU WANT THEM TO STUDY THAT AT 
UNIVERSITY A LOT OF MONEY TO BE 
MADE BUILD DAMS 
NEXT WEEK IS THE 
MAYORAL ELECTION 
IT WILL BE SEEN AS THE FIRST 
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO REGISTER 
THEIR VERDICT ON GORDON BROWN AS 
PRIME MINISTER THEY ARE A BIG TEST 
FOR ALL OF THE PARTIES AS ANY 
CHANGE IN THE UM NUMBER OF 
COUNCILERS WILL BE USED TO JUDGE 
THEIR STANDING L. WILL SPEAK TO ONE 
OF THE GREEN PARTY'S MAIN SPEAKERS 
IN A MOMENT FIRST WE HAVE SOME 
DETAILS OF THE CHALLENGES FACING 
THE GREENS THEY HAVE DESCRIBED THE 
ELECTIONS AS THE FIRST STEPS ON THE 
ROAD TO WESTMINSTER A LOT OF 
PARTIES SAY THAT DON'T THEY THEY 
HOPE DOING WELL NEXT WEEK WILL 
TRANSLATE INTO M. P.'S P. WHERE ARE THEY 
STARTING FROM PRETTY LOW BASE AT 
THE MOMENT THEY HAVE ONE HUNDRED TEN 
COUNCILLORS THAT IS OUT OF TWENTY ONE THOUSAND 
POTENTIAL COUNCILLORS IN ENGLAND 
AND WALES THEY ARE START FROM A 
LOW BASE IN TERMS OF THE VOTE IN 
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE LAST ELECTIONS THREE PER CENT THEIR 
VOTE WAS THEIR HIGH WATERMARK 
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WAS FIFTEEN PER CENT HOW ABOUT ELSEWHERE 
THEY HAVE TWO MEPS TWO GREATER 
LONDON AUTHORITY MEMBERS AND THEY 
HAVE TWO M. S. P.'S IT IS GOING TO BE 
DIFFICULT THEY THINK NEXT WEEK 
THEY WILL GET BIG GAINS THEY WILL 
FOCUS ON NORWICH DISTRICT COUNCIL 
THE ONE WHICH CONTROLS THE BROADS 
IF THEY DO WELL THERE THEY COULD 
BECOME THE SECOND PARTY THERE AND 
THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION THEY SAY 
THEY WILL MAKE BIG GAINS NEXT WEEK 
WHAT BASIS HAVE THEY GOT TO MAKE 
THOSE CLAIMS L. WILL PUT TO A 
MEMBER OF THE GREENS NOW THREE PER CENT OF THE 
VOTE LAST YEAR IT IS AN UPHILL 
TASK WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE GREEN 
PARTY WHICH IS SO DISTINCTIVE THESE 
DAYS WHEN ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES 
ARE TAKING ON A SLIGHTLY GREEN HUE 
I THINK WHAT IS DIFFERENT IS THE 
GREEN PARTY DELIVERS YES THE 
OTHERS MAY TALK GREEN RHETORIC BUT 
THEY ARE NOT DELIVERING GREEN 
POLICIES LOOK AT THIS GOVERNMENT 
WHICH SAYS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS 
THE GREATEST THREAT AND THEN GIVES 
THE BIGGEST EXPANSION TO HEATHROW 
THAT WE COULD HAVE IMAGINED LET'S 
PUT THOSE INTO PERSPECTIVES YES 
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THREE PER CENT F. YOU LOOKED 
A ALL THE SEATS WE DID NOT HAVE 
ENOUGH MONEY TO CONTEST ALL THE 
SEATS IF YOU LOOK AT PLACES LIKE 
BRIGHTON WE DOUBLED OUR COUNCILLORS 
FROM SIX TO TWELVE WE GOT THIRTY PER CENT OF THE 
VOTE AHEAD OF ALL THE OTHER PARTIES 
IF YOU LOOK AT PLACES LIKE 
LANKASSTER WE DOUBLED OUR NUMBERS 
FROM SEVEN ALMOST DOUBLED UP TO 
THIRTEEN WITHIN NOR WIN WE WERE WITHIN 
ONE VOTE OF BECOMING THE OPPOSITION 
TO GET VOTES LIKE THAT ON A FIRST 
PAST THE POST SYSTEM DEMONSTRATES 
PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH THE OTHER 
PARTIES THAT ALTERNATIVE IS 
GREEN ONE 
ONE OF YOUR KEY 
COMMITMENTS IS YOU WANT PEOPLE TO 
USE LOCAL SHOPS MORE L. CAN NOT 
HELP BUT THINK YOUR TIMING ON THIS 
ONE IS PRETTY POOR GIVEN WE HAVE 
SEEN WORLD FOOD PRICES GO UP BY EIGHTY PER CENT 
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS 
SUPERMARKETS OFFER CHEAPER FOOD TO 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO 
PAY THE MORE LOCAL SHOP PRICES 
SURELY THAT IS A BIT OF AN 
UNREALISTIC COMMITMENT 
WELL I 
THINK THE ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND YOUR 
QUESTION ARE WRONG SUPERMARKETS 
ARE NOT ALWAYS CHEAPEST THEY HAVE 
SOME CHEAP LOSS LEADERS 
FOR THE 
BREAD FOR THE MILK NOR THE BASICS 
THAT PEOPLE MAKE UP THEIR MAIN 
WEEKLY SHOPPING WITH THEY ARE 
CHEAPER 
NOT NECESSARYRY ON CHEAPER VEGETABLES NOT EVERYBODY CAN GET 
TO THEM IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 
ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE NUTRITIOUS 
FOOD THEN HAVING OUT OF TOWN 
SUPERMARKETS IS A SILLY WAY WE 
NEED TO REJUVENATE OUR LOCAL HIGH 
STREETS THAT IS WHAT THE GREENS 
ARE DOING THEY ARE ENCOURAGING 
MORE LOCAL SHOPS TO THRIVEVY BEEN 
LISTENING TO THE DISCUSSION ON OIL 
PRICES AT A TIME WHEN THEY ARE 
GOING EVER UP WARDS WE NEED TO 
RELOCALISE OUR ECONOMIES AND NOT 
BASE IT ON A SUPERMARKET SYSTEM 
WHICH HAS HUGE AMOUNTS OF PACKAGES 
TRANSPORT ALL THINGS WHICH ARE 
OIL INTENSIVE F. YOU WANT TO LOOK AT 
THE ECONOMY WE NEED AT A TIME WHEN 
OIL PRICES ARE GOING UP I WOULD 
ARGUE WE ARE IN TUNE WITH THE TIMES 
SMALLER SHOPS MORE LOCAL IS THE 
WAY WE NEED TO GO 
TESCO'S CAR WON 
FOOTPRINT LABELLING SCREAM 
WOULDN'T IT BE MORE PRODUCTIVE 
WORKING THEM RATHER THAN PAINTING 
THEM AT THE ENEMY ALL THE TIME I I DON'T THINK WE ARE PAINTING THEM AS 
THE ENEMY ALL THE TIME THEY ARE AN 
UNSUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION SYSTEM 
OVER TIME IN THE SHORT TERM IT IS 
GOOD THAT TESCOS IS DEMONSTRATING 
HOW BIG ITS CARBON FOOTPRINT IS ON 
DIFFERENT PRODUCTS SOME 
SUPERMARKETS STOCK MORE FAIR TRADE 
PRODUCTS IF WE LOOK AHEAD TWENTY TO THIRTY 
YEARS I THINK THE MODEL WE WILL 
NEED IS ONE WHICH IS LESS OIL 
DEPENDANT THE FACT IS THAT ALL OF 
THIS DISCUSSIONING IS HAPPENING IN 
THE CONTEXT OF OIL PRICES WHICH 
WILL NOT COME BACK DOWN OVER TIME 
THEY WILL KEEP GOING UP BECAUSE 
ESSENTIALLY WE ARE PASSING THE 
POINT OF OIL PRODUCTION WE NEED TO 
START RE THINKING SOME OF OUR 
DEPENDANTS ON UNSUSTAINABLE 
PRODUCTION METHODS 
NICK HAS 
CAROLINE LUCAS PERSUADED YOU TO 
VOTE KPWREEN JO UNFORTUNATELY NOT 
NEVER WILL DO VOTING GREEN IS A 
LUXURY IT IS LIKE WATCHING 
TELEVISION SAYING I WATCH

THE DAILY POLITICS AND SIMPSONS 
THE MINUTE THEY GET IN THEIR 
BALLOT BOX THEY THINK ABOUT THEIR 
PURSE RSSH IF IT WAS A COMPELLING 
ARGUMENT WE WOULD HAVE A LOT OF 
GREEN M. P.'S THE TRUTH IS THEY NEVER 
BREAK THROUGH 
CAN I REPLY TO THAT 
I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT THERE ARE 
GREENS ON ALL KINDS OF GOVERNMENT 
THROUGHOUT EUROPE THERE WAS A 
GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER WHO WAS 
FROM THE GREEN PARTY WE BREAK 
THROUGH WHEN WE HAVE A PARTY 
FUNDING SYSTEM WHICH ENABLES 
SMALLER PARTIES TO BREAK THROUGH 
IT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING WE 
ARE HAVING THEM RESPONSIVE TO US 
WHO INFLUENCED THE GREEN PARTY AS 
IF IT WAS NOT THE GREEN PARTY YOU 
ACT AS IF THEY ARE POINTLESS THEY 
CHANGE THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE 
WITHOUT ANY FUNDING 
YOU CANNOT 
BLAME THE LONDON MAYORAL 
CANDIDATE UKIP AND BEAT THEM 
LAST TIME LET'S GIVE THEM THE 
RELEVANCE WHEN PEOPLE VOTE THEY 
ARE ABOUT SIXTH 
WE MUST MOVE ON 
CAROLINE LUCAS WE HAVE RUN OUT OF 
TIME THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IN 
BRUSSELS THANK YOU LET'S GET OUR 
WEEKLY RUN DOWN OF YOUR STORIES OF
