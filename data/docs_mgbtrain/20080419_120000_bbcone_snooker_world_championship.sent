NORTH OF THE BORDER AGAIN

WON SIX FRAMES ON THE TROT A A REMARKABLE COMEBACK HE WILL BE 
FEELING ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC INSIDE

IT WAS A 
ROLLER COASTER OF EMOTIONS FROM 
THE VERY FIRST DAY L. THOUGHT MARK 
WAS GOING TO COME BACK THAT MAY AND 
THEY DID NOT THINK I HAD ANYTHING 
LEFT TO GIVE BUT I MANAGED TO WIN 
THE LAST TWO OR THREE GAMES IN 
QUICK SUCCESSION

CONFIDENT AT THE MOMENT 
IT WAS A 
RELIEF TO WIN IT AGAIN

POINT IT LOOKED AS IF MATT WAS 
GOING TO COME BACK AND WHEN IT IT 
HAS A QUESTION I HAVE BEEN ASKED A 
LOT WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE IT IF

PERRY IN ROUND ONE HOW WILL HE AND 
THE OTHERS FARE THIS YEAR 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HAS GOT A GOOD 
CHANCE OF WINNING SURELY SOMEONE 
WHO IS THAT TALENTED CANNOT LOSE 
AGAIN 
I HAVE A SNEAKY FEELING FOR AGAIN STEPHEN MAGUIRE AND AN OUTSIDER 
JAMIE COPE 
O'SULLIVAN WILL WIN 
BECAUSE HE HAS ONE OTHER 
TOURNAMENTS 
IT IS ALL ABOUT TOURNAMENTS DAIMLER 
TWO PLAYERS THAT HAVE BEEN DAIMLER QUIET ALL SEASON NEIL ROBERTSON IS 
ONE OF THEM THE AUSTRALIAN AND 
DING JUNHUI 
SHAUN MURPHY HAD A 
GREAT SEASON AND WILL DO VERY WELL 
HEARS FROM ROTHERHAM HIGGINS HIGGINS BECAUSE HE WON IT LAST YEAR SHAUN SHAUN MURPHY HAS BEEN A VERY CONSISTENT 
EVERYWHERE HE HAS GONE A HE HAS 
PLAYED TO A HIGH STANDARD LOADS OF 
SEMI FINALS HE WON THE MALTA CUP 
AS WELL NEIL ROBERTSON IS COMING 
INTO FORM 
BUT SELBY COULD WIN IT 
THE HAS HAD A VERY GOOD SEASON HE 
HAD A GOOD SEASON LAST YEAR 
SELBY I WOULD LIKE MATTHEW STEVENS 
TO WIN THERE 
I FELT MAGUIRE OR 
MURPHY MIGHT WIN 
ROBINSON WILL DO 
IT I HAVE COME TO WATCH HIM 
PLENTY OF OPINIONS THERE IF HE 
WOULD LIKE TO BACK THOSE OPINIONS 
WITH SMALL WAGER THIS IS HOW THE 
MARKET IS FOR THIS YEAR'S 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
NOTICE DOWN THERE IT IS SEVEN TO FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
BREAK TO BE MADE IN THE TOURNAMENT 
YOU CAN BACK THEM INDIVIDUALLY 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN MIGHT BE A BIT 
BIG TO MAKE ONE FOR SEVEN OVER THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS HE CAN BACK 
THESE PLAYERS TO WIN THEIR 
INDIVIDUAL QUARTER JOHN HIGGINS IS 
A FIVE TO TWO SHOT RONNIE IS EIGHT TO ELEVEN MAGUIRE 
IS ELEVEN TO WAIT HE WOULD I HAVE MY 
BET ON IT LOOKS TOUGH FOR ME IT 
SPLINTERS AND I'M GOING TO SIT ON 
THE FENCE AGAIN 
THEY CHANGED THEIR JOHN PARROTT 
NOW YOU KNOW WHO IS HERE AND HE IS 
FANCIED LET'S TELL YOU WHAT IS 
COMING UP ON THE OPENING DAY OF THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
A THE MAN IN POSSESSION OF THE 
TROPHY STATUS OF AN THIS YEAR THAT 
IS JOHN HIGGINS THE MAN WHAT IS 
START AGAINST CRIZZLE SPECIALIST 
MATTHEW STEVENS 
I WILL BE 
COMMENTATING AND IT IS AL NERVOUS 
TIME FOR THE DEFENDING CHAMPION IN 
MATTHEW STEVENS HE HAS GOT A TOUGH 
OPPONENT HE HAS NOT BEEN GOING 
THROUGH THE BEST OF TIMES RECENTLY 
AND HAD TO QUALIFY TO GET HERE BUT 
REMEMBER TWICE HE HAS BEEN IN THE 
FINAL 
IF THE MELBOURNE MACHINE FINAL NEIL ROBERTSON HAS BEEN MISFIRING 
THE SEASON BUT WHO WILL SEE OF THE 
FLAMBOYANT FOZZIE HAS TUNED UP IN 
TIME FOR THE BIG ONE FACING HIM IS 
NIGEL BOND HE CAN TAKE MORE THAN A 
QUANTUM OF SOLACE FROM HIS RECORD 
HERE 
I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF HERE COMMENTATING ON THIS GAME IT IS A 
TOUGH ONE TO CALL THE FACT THAT IT 
IS JAMIE COPE FIRST TIME HERE 
MEANS HE WILL HAVE IT ALL TO DO 
AGAINST THE EXPERIENCED PETER EBDON 
IT HAS BEEN A GREAT SEASON FOR MARK 
SELBY AND OTHERS AND WE WILL BE 
LOOKING BACK AGAINST OVER THE 
WHOLE STICKER CAMPAIGN SINCE AUGUST 
WHEN THE DRAW WAS MADE FOR THE 
FIRST ROUND SOME FIVE WEEKS AGO 
THERE WAS ONE TIE IN PARTICULAR 
WHICH HAD EVERYONE RUBBING THEIR 
HANDS WITH ANTICIPATION EVERYWHERE 
EXCEPT PERHAPS THE TWO PLAYERS 
INVOLVED JOHN HIGGINS AND MATTHEW 
STEVENS 
IT IS A FANTASTIC MATCH FOR THE 
PUBLIC TO WATCH BUT IT IS NOT SO 
GREAT FOR US AS SOON AS WE GET OUT 
THERE IT IS GOING TO BE A GREAT 
MATCH AND ONE AM LOOKING FORWARD TO 
IT IS A VERY TOUGH DRAW CONSIDERING 
YOU EXPECT MATTHEW TO BE THE TOP SIXTEEN 
HE WOULD NEVER EXPECTING TO BE A 
QUALIFIER IT SO HAPPENS THIS YEAR 
HE IS A QUALIFIER IT IS VERY 
TOUGH DRAW 
JOHN IT PROBABLY DIDN'T 
WANT TO DRAW ME BUT NOW IT IS DONE 
IT DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH WE HAVE 
HAD SIX WEEKS TO THINK ABOUT IT AND 
BOTH OF US WOULD HAVE PREPARED WELL 
I BET WE ARE BOTH LOOKING FORWARD 
TO IT 
IN A WAY I'M GLAD I'M 
PLAYING SOMEONE LIKE MAFIA L. KNOW 
I HAVE TO BE FULLY FOCUSED AND PLAY 
WELL LIKE MATTHEW IF I DON'T 
PLAY WELL I COULD EASILY BE USED 
TO MATHIEU THE PROBLEM IN A WAY 
I'M GLAD I'M PLAYING MATTHEW 
BECAUSE IT WILL FOCUS ME TO PLAY 
BUT BEST SNOOKER MATTHEW AFTER AFTER THE BIG BUILDER'S AFTER THE BIG 
BUILD UP THE PLAYERS HAVE BEEN 
CALLED INTO THE ARENA 
POISED IN THE COMMENTARY BOX THIS 
MORNING WERE JOHN VIRGO AND CLIVE 
EVERTON BEST OF NINETEEN FRAMES IT IS 
A LONG HAUL THIS IS THE FIRST OF 
THE TWO OPENING SESSIONS STEVENS 
TOOK THE FIRST HIGGINS RESPONDED 
AND THIS IS THE THIRD 
THAT WAS CLOSE BUT IT DIDN'T 
GOING THIS WILL BE SOME KIND OF 
SHOT IT DIDN'T GO IN 
THE BLACK ISN'T AVAILABLE THE PINK 
IS POSSIBLY AVAILABLE INTO THE 
OPPOSITE CORNER THE HARDER YOU HIT 
IT THE LESS BE CUE BALL BALL 
BOUNCED OFF THE TOP CUSHION THE 
LESS GOOD CUE BALL WILL BOUNCE NOT A BAD EFFORT 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE POTTING ANGLE 
OF THIS BLACK 
NICELY DONE AND THE CAN AND WORKED 
OUT WELL TOO THE CANNON 
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN ENOUGH FROM 
STEVENS TO CONFIRM THAT HE IS A 
GENUINE THREAT TO THE DEFENDING 
CHAMPION 
IT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT 
HIGGINS COULD SUFFER AS DEFENDING 
CHAMPION THE SAME FATE THAT JOHN 
SPENCER TERRY GRIFFITHS STEVE 
DAVIS DENNIS TAYLOR STEPHEN 
HENDRY AND GRAEME DOTT HAVE ALL 
SUFFERED 
HE WOULD HAVE HAD A SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT ANGLE ON THE BLACK BUT 
FOR THAT KICKED 
YOU COULD CLEARLY SEE THE CUE BALL 
AND THE OBJECT BALL THE PROBLEM IS 
THIS RED NEAR THE TOP CUSHION DECENT SHOT DECENT SHOT 
HE NEEDS REDS IN THE OPEN IF HE IS 
GOING TO CLINCH IT THIS VISIT HE 
WILL SETTLE FOR THAT A LITTLE 
UNLUCKY ACTUALLY THAT RED DRIFTED 
ON SEE THE BACKSPIN 
HE CERTAINLY BROUGHT THREE MORE 
REDS INTO PLAY 
THAT'S NINE RATES THE NINTH BLACK 
COMING UP REDS 
HAD HE BEEN SOLELY CONCERNED WITH 
PURSUING MAXIMUM HE MIGHT HAVE 
RISKED GOING INTO THE BUNCH ARE 
THERE HE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE OF 
WINNING THE FRAME FIRST THIS ROAD 
WOULD BE ENOUGH THIS RED 
WITH HIGGINS ALREADY MEETING THREE 
SNOOKERS STEVENS CAN DEVOUT 
HIMSELF TO A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN ATTEMPT 
THE FRAME IS SAFE SO NOTHING TO 
LOSE 
IT IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOR A MAXIMUM AND 
TEN THOUSAND FOR BREAK PRICE UNLESS 
BOTH PRIZES NEED TO BE SHED NEED 
TO BE SHARED 
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT 
STRAIGHT ON THIS BLACK BUT IT IS 
O. K. 
THE BIG PROBLEM IS THE RED JUST 
PART THE RIGHT MIDDLE JUST PAST 
IT COULD BE THE FIRST CENTURY OF 
THIS YEAR'S CHAMPIONSHIP 
SURELY IT 
WILL BE 
ONLY HIS FIFTH CENTURY OF THE SEASON 
HE IS ALREADY HAVING A LOOK AT THIS 
RED HE IS LOOKING TO SEE THE 
POSSIBILITIES OF IT GOING DOWN THE 
CUSHION 
AS WE SAID NOTHING TO LOSE AND 
EVERYTHING TO GAIN WILL HE TRY TO 
DISTURB THIS RED OR WILL HE DROPPED 
TO THE SIDE CUSHION L. DON'T KNOW WILL HE DROPPED 
HE MISSES THE BLACK BUT HE FLICKS 
IT GROUPS IT 
I THINK HE IS TOO CLOSE TO THE 
CUSHION THE RED HE WILL GET THE 
DOUBLE KISS AFTER THAT BLACK JUST 
HEATED AND HOPE JUST TO HIT IT 
IT IS TOO TIGHT YOU GET THE DOUBLE 
KISS 
GREAT ATTEMPT 
MAGNIFICENT ATTEMPT AT A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN COMES 
TO AN END HE GETS ONE HUNDRED TWELVE AND LEEDS 
THERE IS A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND BONUS FOR A 
MAXIMUM BREAK THE LAST ONE WAS 
MARK WILLIAMS THREE YEARS AGO BUT 
AT LEAST WE GOT OUR FIRST CENTURY 
AND NOW WE GO TO FRAME FOUR 
MATTHEW IS MARGINALLY AHEAD 
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL YOU 
DON'T MAKE CONTACT WITH THE YELLOW 
COMING ROUND TO TWO CUSHIONS 
HE JUDGED IT PRETTY WELL BUT ONCE 
AGAIN NOT TIED ON THE BAULK 
CUSHION SO NOT THE PERFECT SAFETY 
NOT TIGHT 
AND THERE WAS NO BAULK 
COLOUR TO HIDE BEHIND 
TERRIFIC POT THAT FROM JOHN AND 
WE NOTE THE GRINGOS OF THE BLUE 
WE KNOW THAT THE GREEN GOES OFF OF 
THE BLUE AND THE LAST OF THE EASY REDS 
IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT HE GOT A 
GOOD ANGLE ON THE COLOUR 
HE COULD BE ON NOTHING HERE END OF 
BREAK HE HAS AN ELEVEN POINT LEAD AND 
A SAFETY TO COME 
HE WAS PROBABLY HOPING HE COULD 
HAVE KISSED THE RED HE DRIFTED BY 
IT WAS ALWAYS GOING 
TO BE DIFFICULT TO WIN THE FRAME AT THAT THERE IS 
IT IT IS A GOOD SAFETY SHOT TO 
FINISH WITH TO WIN THE FRAME AT 
THAT VISIT SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR ME 
HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET MUCH 
PLACE IN THE RED HE IS PLAYING 
MUCH PACE THE WORST POSSIBLE 
SCENARIO BUT I COULD NOT BEING THE 
VALUE SHOT WHATSOEVER IT COULD 
HAVE COST IN THE FRAME EVEN IF IT 
DOESN'T KISS THE BLACK HE IS NOT 
GOING TO COVER THAT RED BECAUSE HE 
WAS SO CLOSE TO THE RED HE COULD 
NOT INJECT ENOUGH PACE HE SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT THAT RED WAS 
GOING TO RUN INTO THE BLACK JOHN 
NEEDS A NICE KISS HERE CAN HE GET 
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUE BALL 
PLAYING FOR THE BLUE JUST ABOUT 
IT'S IN AND HE IS ON THE RED AND 
NOW THERE SHOULD BE NO QUESTION RED PINK YELLOW WOULD BE ENOUGH 
SO THE YELLOW TO GO TWENTY SIX POINTS 
AHEAD WITH ONLY TWENTY FIVE REMAINING 
TWICE MATTHEW STEVENS HAS BEEN THE 
ODD FRAME IN FRONT BUT FOR THE 
SECOND TIME JOHN HIGGINS IS 
LEVELLING THE MATCH 
THE HIGHLIGHT SO FAR THE FOURTEEN REDS 
FOURTEEN BLACKS FROM STEVENS IN THE THIRD 
FRAME HIGGINS TAKES THE FOURTH IT IS 
TWO TO TWO AT THE MIDSESSION INTERVAL 
THAT WAS THE LONGEST FRAME OF THE 
MATCH SO FAR AT ONLY TWENTY TWO MINUTES 
WHEN THEY CAME BACK THEY KNEW THAT 
THEY HAD FIVE MORE FRAMES IN THIS 
OPENING SESSION AHEAD OF THEM 
IF JOHN GET SAID THE EXTENSION AND 
DROPS IT INTO THE LEFT CORNER AND 
REMAIN ON THE BLACK TO THE OPPOSITE 
CORNER IN THIS INSTANCE MAYBE 
THE FIVE TO FOUR LOOKS THE BOOKIES ALWAYS 
GET IT RIGHT DON'T THEY 
HE HAS A NICE ANGLE ON HIS BLOOD TO 
DISTURB THE REDS HE WANTS TO CLEAR 
THE BLACKSPOT IF HE CAN L. THINK HE 
HAS JUST ABOUT GOT AN ANGLE ON THIS 
BLACK 
AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY INCH PERFECT 
GOOD SHOT 
BEFORE THE INTERVAL THOSE LADS 
WERE WEARING AT DUNDEE UNITED'S 
SHIRTS WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE 
INTERVAL TO SWITCH THEIR ALLEGIANCE 
TO COVENTRY CITY 
JUST FOOTBALL 
LOVERS AREN'T THEY IN THE 
MEANTIME WE HAVE SEEN MATTHEW 
STEVENS ALREADY IN THESE FIRST FOUR 
FRAMES GET FOURTEEN REDS FOURTEEN BLACKS THIS 
IS A REASONABLE CHANCE FOR JOHN 
HIGGINS THERE IS NOT A SAFE RED 
HIGGINS HAS MADE FIVE MAXIMUM IS IN 
COMPETITION MAXIMUMS 
I THINK JOHN IS WELL AWARE OF THE 
POSSIBILITIES HERE AS WE KNOW 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOR THE MAXIMUM IS GOING 
TO GET YOUR ATTENTION 
YOU CAN SEE THE PROBLEM WITH THE 
CRUCIBLE A TO TABLE SITUATION 
NOISE COMING FROM THE OTHER TABLE 
INCH PERFECT AGAIN THAT WAS A GOOD 
SHOT BECAUSE THAT HAS CLEARED A 
PATH 
DID NOT GET THE BEST OF CONTACT 
THERE WHEN HE POTTED THE BLACK 
THERE WAS A SLIGHT BOUNCE HE 
WANTED TO THROW THE CUE BALL A 
LITTLE BIT WIDER 
HE DIDN'T PLAY FOR THE RED THE 
GAME IS MORE IMPORTANT 
JUST ONE MORE RED NEEDED TO SECURE 
THE FRAME 
HE IS GOING TO GO IN FRONT NOW FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN THE MATCH ALWAYS 
A LOT OF PRESSURE ON A DEFENDING 
CHAMPION HE DID IT WILL CALL A 
COUPLE OF FRAMES AGO CLIVE OF 
WINNERS TO HAVE GONE OUT IN THE 
FIRST ROUND BUT JOHN HIGGINS LOOKS 
IN GOOD FORM HE WILL CERTAINLY BE 
FEELING A LOT MORE RELAXED THAN HE 
WAS AT THE START OF THE MATCH HE 
MAY PLAY THE ONE TO THE RIGHT 
CENTRE NOW THE RED TO THE RIGHT 
CENTRE NOT THAT EASY TO CONTROL 
BUT THE FRAME IS OVER HE IS GOING 
TO PLAY THE WANT OF THIS LEFT 
CORNER THE ONE TO THIS LEFT 
CORNER 
NO CENTURY BUT EIGHTY THREE MORE THAN ENOUGH 
TO PUT JOHN HIGGINS IN FRONT FOR 
THE FIRST TIME HE LEADS MATTHEW 
STEVENS BY THREE TO TWO 
AND THE 
REIGNING CHAMPION LEAVE IT A LITTLE 
MORE DAYLIGHT BETWEEN HIMSELF AND 
THE WELSHMAN TAKING THE NEXT FRAME 
AS WELL THAT WE GO INTO FRAME 
SEVEN NOW AT STEVENS IS SIX POINTS 
BEHIND IN THIS ONE 
THAT KISS ON THE GREEN MAY NOT HAVE 
HELPED MATTHEW FOUL 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM HE TRIED FOUL TO PINCH A BIT THERE DID JOHN NOT NOT CALAMITOUS THOUGH BECAUSE THE 
REMAINING RED IS NOT POSSIBLE 
PORTABLE 
THE ONLY THING IS YOU PORTABLE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR HAND ON THE 
TABLE PLAYING THE FIRST SAFETY 
SHOT THE WAY THE BALL SO SITUATED 
A BIG TARGET FOR PLAYING SNOOKERS 
IT IS IMPORTANT NOW BUT IF YOU 
DON'T GET THE SNOOKER YOU GET THE 
RED SAFE APART FROM THE BLACK ALL 
THE OTHER BALLS ARE IN THE OPEN 
IS HE HAVING A LOOK AT THE CROSS 
DOUBLE TO THE RIGHT CENTRE IT IS A 
RISKY SHOT TO TAKE ON HE OBVIOUSLY 
DOESN'T FEEL AS IF HE CAN PLAY THE 
CUE BALL IN BEHIND THE YELLOW BLUE 
GREEN OR BROWN 
RISKY BECAUSE ONCE THEY DON'T GO 
IN THOSE CROSS DOUBLES YOU DON'T 
KNOW WHERE THEIR CUE BALL OR THE 
RED ARE THEY TO FINISH IT TURNS 
OUT NOW THAT HE HAS LEFT A POT ON 
FOR JOHN PITHY KNOCKS THIS IN 
IF HE KNOCKS THIS THEN HE SHOULD 
TAKE THE FRAME 
STEVEN SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE HAD THE 
CUE BALL BACK AT PAUL COOKE BAULK 
THERE WAS AN OLD SAYING THAT 
PROFESSIONALS DIDN'T PLAY DOUBLES 
AND FOR THAT REASON IF YOU MISS 
THE DOUBLE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE 
THE RED IS GOING TO FINISH UP 
HE HAS NOW WON FOUR CONSECUTIVE 
FRAMES TO LEAD BY FIVE TO TWO THIS MATCH 
IS STARTING TO SLIP AWAY FROM 
STEVENS STEVENS IT WAS THAT CROSSED DOUBLE ATTEMPT 
WHICH COST HIM DEAR ME IN THAT 
FRAME AND HE MUST BE A LITTLE BIT 
CONCERNED HERE BECAUSE STEVENS HAS 
NEVER LOST A FIRST ROUND MATCH AT 
THE CRUCIBLE HE DOES NOT WANT TO 
FIND HIMSELF TOO FAR BEHIND 
REMEMBER THE FIRST TO TEN WILL GO 
THROUGH INTO FRAME EIGHT NOW 
THIS IS ANOTHER EXCELLENT 
OPPORTUNITY ILIE ON THE FRAME IN THE ON IN THE FRAME 
YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER JOHN THAT 
THE BRAQUE BLACK TURNS OUT TO BE 
THE FIVE TO FOUR FAVOURITE TO BE THE FIRST 
COLOUR POTTED IN THE FRAME THINK 
IT HAS BEEN POTTED FIRST IN ABOUT 
FOUR OF THE FRAMES 
YES I THINK IF 
IT TAKES A COUPLE OF SAFETY SHOTS 
BEFORE THE FIRST RED HAS POTTED 
THE BLACK DOES BECOME FAVOURED A 
FAVOURITE 
HE HAS PLAYED IT NICELY AS LONG AS 
HE IS NOT TOO STRAIGHT ON THIS 
PLAQUE SECOND LOOK HE IS PROBABLY 
STRAIGHT ENOUGH ON THIS BLACK 
YES HE COULDN'T DO A LOT WITH THE 
CUE BALL SO THERE WERE TWO WAYS 
OF PLAY THAT YOU COULD PLAY THE 
RUN THROUGH OR DIG DOWN AND SCREW 
BACK BUT THAT MADE THEIR BLACK 
MORE DIFFICULT SO HE TOOK EASIER 
OPTION HE MADE CERTAIN OF THE 
BLACK AND HE IS ON THIS RED TO THE 
RIGHT MIDDLE 
NOW A PERFECT ANGLE ON THE BLUE AND 
I AM CERTAIN I CANNOT SEE ANY RED 
THAT IS EASY TO GET ON SO I THINK 
THEY CAN THEN ON THE PINK HERE 
BRING THAT THE REDS IN TO PLAY IS 
THE ORDER OF THE DAY BRING THE 
REDS INTO PLAY 
THERE APPEARS TO BE NO PROBLEM 
ABOUT GETTING ON THE BLACK TO THE 
OTHER CORNER THEY FRAME WINNING 
OPPORTUNITY A FRAME WINNING 
OPPORTUNITY 
ON FORTY ONE HIGGINS MADE TO CARRY SHOT 
CHOICES HE RODE ABSOLUTELY SURE OF 
THE BLACK HE MADE ABSOLUTELY 
SURE OF THE BLACK RATHER THAN 
PLAYING IT MORE ADVENTUROUSLY 
POSSIBLY OPENING OF THE BUNCH BUT 
IN DOING IT PLAYING THE SHOT THAT 
WAY HE WAS ALWAYS LIKELY TO READ 
END THE BLACK SEQUINS BUT HE TOOK 
THE BLUE AND IS GOING TO WIN THE 
FRAME WELL AS IF HE HAD BEEN 
DAZZLED BY THE PROSPECT OF A ONE 
FOR SEVEN HE MIGHT NOT BE IN THIS 
HAPPY POSITION ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
IT IS TWICE HE HAS BIT THE BULLET 
ISN'T IT HE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT 
WINNING THE FRAME IS AND AS WE SAID 
AT THE START OF THIS MATCH THERE 
IS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE 
DEFENDING CHAMPION 
NOW HE HAS GOT A LOVELY RHYTHM 
GOING AND WHEN HE GETS CHANCES IT 
HE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF THEM 
A BIT CARELESS THERE BUT HE 
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IF THE FRAME HAD 
STILL BEEN IN THEIR BALANCE A 
BREAK OF EIGHTY FIVE THE INCREASE IS HIS 
NEED TO SIXTY 
THESE MEN HAVE MET IN 
THE QUARTER FINAL AND THE SEMI 
FINAL IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP HERE BUT 
NEVER IN THE FIRST ROUND AND IT 
SEEMS TO HAVE CONCENTRATED JOHN 
HIGGINS HIS MIND CAN HE PUSH HIS 
ADVANTAGE EVEN FURTHER IN THE LAST 
FRAME OF THE SESSION SURELY HE HAS LEFT SOMETHING 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW HE WOULD 
LOVE TO HAVE THE PINK BEEN PLAY 
HERE MAYBE HE CAN DO CANNON ON TOP 
OF THE PINKS THE PINK IN AN 
EFFORT TO BRING THE PINK INTO PLAY 
THE BLACK WAS NEAR THE TOP CUSHION 
KEEPING HAVING TO GO FOR THE BLUE 
AND BAULK COLOURS IS NEVER THE 
IDEAL THING TO DO 
THIS IS GOING TO BE HIS FIFTH BREAK 
OVER FIFTY THIS MORNING TWO OF THOSE 
HAVE BEEN OVER EIGHTY 
IT IS HIS NINTH OVER THIRTY PRETTY HEAVY 
SCORING NINETY FOUR PER CENT POT SUCCESS RATE 
BUT THE MOST OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE PLAYERS HAS BEEN ON THE 
SAFETY SUCCESS RATE HIGGINS NINETY THREE 
BUT STEVENS ONE IN THREE OF HIS 
SAFETY'S HAVEN'T TURNED OUT NOT TO 
BE SAFE 
I THINK THAT IS THE 
IMPORTANT STATISTIC EVERYBODY 
LOOKED AT THIS WHEN THE DRAW WAS 
MADE AND SAID THIS WAS A MATCH THAT 
COULD HAVE GONE EITHER WAY 
BUT JOHN HIND BUT JOHN HIGGINS 
HAS DICTATED MATTERS FROM THE FOURTH 
FRAME ONWARDS 
HIGGINS THOUGHT THAT WAS WORTH A GO 
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY 
IT IS VERY RARE INDEED THAT HIGGINS 
PLAYS A ROLL SHOT A WRONG SHOT 
OR SHOT THAT WE PUNDITS WOULD 
CONSIDER A LONG SHOT 
NOT SO MUCH 
OF THE WE 
HE HAS SHOWN THAT TYPE OF FORM THAT 
MAKES HIM FEARED BY EVERYBODY WHEN 
HIS SAFETY IS GOOD AND WHEN HE 
GETS IN HE SCORES HEAVILY HE IS A 
MATCH FOR ANYONE IN THE GAME 
SO FAR HIS DEFENCE OF THE TITLE IS 
GOING TO PLAN 
HE JUDGED IT BETTER THE SECOND TIME 
FIFTY SIX POINTS IN THE LEAD BUT THE WAY 
THE BALLS ARE SITUATED IT WILL 
BE A BIG ASK YOU NEED A COUPLE OF 
VISITS A COUPLE OF GOOD CHANCES 
JOHN HIGGINS OF COURSE JUST NEEDS 
ONE MORE CHANCE 
STEVENS CAUGHT THAT TOO THICK 
WHICH IS WHY HE HAS BROUGHT THAT 
RED DOWN INTO POT BALL POSITION POTTABLE POSITION 
INCH PERFECT ON THE BLUE HE IS 
GOING TO TAKE A FIRE FRAME 
ADVANTAGE INTO THIS EVENING'S 
SECOND SESSION FIVE FRAME FIRST TO 
TEN REMEMBER 
STEVENS HAS GONE OFF A BIT 
PARTICULARLY IN THE SAFETY 
DEPARTMENT AND HIGGINS HAS PLAYED 
EXTREMELY WELL 
HE HAS PUT TOGETHER A RUN OF WHAT 
IS GOING TO BE SIX STRAIGHT FRAMES 
TO ACCUMULATE AN OVERWHELMING 
ADVANTAGE TO CARRY INTO THE EVENING 
SESSION 
JOHN HIGGINS LEADS MATTHEW STEVENS 
BY SEVEN FRAMES TO TWO AT LUNCH AND 
THEREFORE NEEDS ONLY THREE OF THIS 
EVENING'S TEN FRAMES TO GO THROUGH 
TO THE LAST SIXTEEN 
THEY ARE COMING BACK FOR DINNER 
TIME THAT IS SURPRISE SCORELINE 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THE PROSPECT 
OF PLAYING MATTHEW WILL BE IN 
HIGGINS'S MIND 
IT MAY HAVE DONE 
HIM A FAVOUR YOU THINK THAT IS A 
STINKER BUT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO 
BE PLAYING YOUR BEST AND IT HAS 
CONCENTRATED HIM 
IT IS TWELVE YEARS 
STEVE SINCE A CHAMPION HAS 
SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED THE TITLE HE 
IS THAT ONE OF THE REASONS HIGGINS 
HAS SLIPPED IN THE BETTING STAKES 
POSSIBLY HE ELEVEN TO ONE FOR THE WORLD 
CHAMPION IT IS QUITE A BIG PRIZE 
IT MAY REFLECT HOW MANY TOURNAMENTS 
HE HASN'T WON THIS YEAR GENERALLY 
WE ARE LOOKING AT SO MANY PLAYERS 
WHO HAVE HAD GOOD SEASONS MAGUIRE 
AND SELBY AND SHAUN MURPHY AND 
RONNIE IS ALWAYS IN THE MIX BUT 
PERHAPS PEOPLE HAVE DISCOUNTED JOHN 
HIGGINS AND HOW CAN YOU DISCOUNT 
SUCH GOOD PLAYER 
LOTS OF PEOPLE 
IN HERE WE WILL SPEND A FAIR BIT 
OF TIME JOHN IS ALWAYS CHATTING 
PEOPLE UP I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT 
CHATTING TO PEOPLE HE'S GOT SOME 
FRIENDS 
YES WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF FRIENDS THAT 
I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT THAT QUITE SURPRISED BY THE SCORELINE 
YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE CLOSER YES YES WHAT ABOUT THE PLAYERS THEMSELVES 
DID THEY LOOK CONTROL NERVOUS DID 
YOU SEE ANY CHANGES 
YES IN 
MATTHEW STEVENS AS HIGGINS WAS 
GETTING FURTHER AHEAD YOU SAW HIM 
GETTING NERVOUS BUT HIGGINS 
REMAINS CONTROLLED 
DID YOU ENJOY 
THAT DAVID 
FOR YES 
THE SCORELINE 
IS A MASSIVE CONTROL SURPRISE 
YES ESPECIALLY AFTER THE START 
FROM MATTHEW'S BUT THAT CROSS ON 
THE SAFETY MIGHT BE THE ONE THAT 
YOU LOSE AT THE END OF THE DAY HE HE LOST MOMENTUM 
YES HE WAS REALLY 
DOING WELL AND THEN THE CROSS 
DOUBLE HE HAS BEEN OVERPOWERED 
SINCE THEN 
ANY WAY BACK FOR 
MATTHEW 
IF HE CAN WIN THE FIRST MATTHEW TWO TONIGHT IT MIGHT MAKE THE 
EVENING SESSION MORE INTERESTING 
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WITH THIS GAME 
VALUE FOR MONEY REQUIRED FOR THE 
PAYING PUBLIC THIS IS ONE OF SEVEN 
MAJOR TOURNAMENTS ON THE SNOOKER 
CIRCUIT FOR EAT SEASON AND IT IS A 
SEASON THAT BEGAN THIS TIME BACK IN 
LATE SUMMER IN CHINA 
HE IS CERTAINLY MAKING A BID FOR 
MAN OF THE SEASON STEVE MCQUIRE 
AND SELBY AND SHAUN MURPHY HE HAS 
BEEN IN FIVE OR SIX SEMI FINALS AND 
WON A TITLE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN THE 
U. K. TITLE AND THIS BOILS DOWN TO 
THE FACT THAT WE STILL DON'T KNOW 
WHO WILL BE WORLD NUMBER ONE IN THE 
RANKINGS NEXT SEASON IT WILL BE 
INTRIGUING 
YES CONSISTENCY COMES INTRIGUING INTO THE EQUATION YOU CAN BE PROUD 
IF YOU ARE CONSISTENT YOU'D LOVE 
TO BE WORLD CHAMPION AND NO ONE BUT 
IT IS DURING THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD 
PLAYERS IN THE GAME THAT THE 
BARRIERS ARE BLURRED 
A RONNIE SAID 
SOMETHING I REMEMBER HE SAID THE 
OLDER PLAYERS ARE HAVING TO COME 
STOPPERS ALMOST THEY ARE IN FEAR 
OF THE YOUNG GUYS LIKE SELBY AND 
MURPHY COMING THROUGH THE RANKS 
DO YOU SENSE THAT 
IT IS THE CIRCLE 
OF LIFE IT IS THE WAY THINGS WORK 
OUT IF A PHENOMENAL ACHIEVEMENT 
FOR HIM AT HIS AGE TO BE A TOP SIXTEEN 
PLAYER I AM FORTY FOUR AND FIND IT 
DIFFICULT TO HANG ABOUT THE 
STANDARDS HAVE GOT HIGHER AND 
HIGHER THROUGH THE YEARS AND NOW I 
SAID BEFORE I COULD NOT PICK A 
WINNER AND I STILL CAN'T IT IS 
VERY COMPETITIVE SELBY O'SULLIVAN 
MAGUIRE EBDON DOHERTY MURCIA AND 
OTHER PLAYERS I HAVEN'T MENTIONED 
MURPHY MARCO FU IS DANGEROUS 
THERE ARE EIGHT OR TEN OR TWELVE PLAYERS 
OUR RANKING LIST AS IT STANDS IS 
USUALLY ONE YEAR OUT OF DATE WITH 
WHO THE BEST PLAYERS ARE IF WE 
HAVE A ONE YEAR RANKING THIS 
YEAR'S ALL OF A SUDDEN THE TOP SIXTEEN 
IS SWITCHING VERY QUICKLY LET'S LET'S GET INTO THE MYSTERIES OF THE 
RANKING SYSTEM IT IS TOO EARLY 
MAN OF THE SEASON LAST TIME AROUND 
WAS IN FACT AUSTRALIA'S NEIL 
ROBERTS AND HE MADE A REAL FIST FOR 
GLORY WITH TWO WORLD RANKING TITLES 
THE ONLY FELLOW TO DO THAT LAST 
SEASON AND HE MADE HISTORY IN 
ABERDEEN TO BECOME THE FIRST 
AUSTRALIAN THE MAN FROM MELBOURNE 
TO WIN A WORLD RANKING TITLE AND 
YOU FOLLOWED THAT WITH VICTORY AT 
THE WELSH OPEN MANY EXPECTED HIM 
TO MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS THIS TERM 
BUT AS HE ADMITS IT HASN'T REALLY 
HAPPENED FOR THE FLAMBOYANT AUSSIE 
THE FIRST THIRD OF THE SEASON EACH 
TOURNAMENT I CAME UP WITH A 
DIFFERENT REASON OR EXCUSE I GUESS 
AT THE END OF THE DAY IT HAS JUST 
BEEN DOWN L. TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE 
PEDAL IN TERMS OF PRACTISING REALLY 
HARD I WAS STILL PRACTISING BUT NO 
WAY NEAR AS HARD AS LAST SEASON 
THE BELIEF IS STILL THERE L. 
BELIEVE I CAN WIN THIS TOURNAMENT 
BUT WHEN YOU WARM WINNING MATCHES 
CONSISTENTLY ALL THE TIME OR 
WHEN YOU ARE WINNING MATCHES 
CONSISTENTLY YOU TEND TO BE MORE 
FEARLESS AND ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT 
MISSING BECAUSE YOU WERE JUST 
WAITING FOR THE GUIDE TO MAKE ONE 
MISTAKE AND CLEAR THE TABLE L. 
THINK I HAVE A GOOD A CHANCE AS 
ANYONE ELSE THE PRESSURE WOULD BE 
ON ME AS MUCH AS THE LIKES OF MERCY 
MAGUIRE AND SELBY AND RONNIE 
SHAUN MURPHY IT WILL BE NICE TO 
SNEAK MY WAY THROUGH L. AM REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
HIS OPPONENT NIGEL BOND FIRST 
DROVE UP THE ROAD FROM DERBY TO THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO TWO QUARTER 
FINALS RUN UP TO STEPHEN HENDRY 
AND SEMI FINALS IN NINETY SIX HE HAS NEVER 
MADE IT PAST ROUND TWO SINCE BUT HE 
IS AS ENTHUSIASTIC FOR PLAYING AS 
EVER EVER ROBINSON'S BED TO AN EARLY THREE TO ONE 
ADVANTAGE WE JOIN THEM IN FRAME 
FOUR ROBINSON SPARED 
I TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE SEEN THESE 
STAY OUT BEFORE ON TABLES 
JUST SHOWS ONE LITTLE CARELESS 
SHOT HOW COSTLY IT CAN BE NIGEL 
WAS ON A BREAK OF FORTY EIGHT HE LED BY A 
CONSIDERABLE MARKET MARGIN AND 
NOW THAT COULD AMOUNT TO NOTHING 
BECAUSE ROBERTSON IS FAVOURITE TO 
WIN THIS FRAME HE IS TWENTY SIX BEHIND BUT 
WHERE THE BALLS ARE YOU WOULD 
EXPECT HIM TO COME CLOSE 
HE WAS LITTLE BIT UNLUCKY ON THE LAST SHOT HE HAS ONE MORE GOOD POSITIONAL 
SHOT TO PLAY IF HE CLEARS THE RED 
TO THE LEFT OF THE PINK THE OTHER 
TWO WILL POT 
HE IS A BIT STRAIGHT ON THIS BLACK 
VERY SLIGHT ANGLE 
THAT WAS WHY HE HAD TO PUT A BIT 
MORE INTO THAT BUT NO PROBLEM 
THERE AT ALL HE HAS ALL THE CUE 
POWER IN THE WORLD HE IS LOOKING 
AT THE ONE ACROSS THE CUSHION 
WHICH IS MORE DIFFICULT THIS WOULD 
BE A BRAVE ONE TO TAKE ON BECAUSE 
THE OTHER ONE IS EASY ALL CREDIT 
IF HE PLAYS THIS THIS IS THE ONLY 
REMOTELY DIFFICULT SHOT HE HAS GOT 
I THINK I WOULD RATHER BE ON IT 
EASIER THAN THIS NEIL 
HE NOW BECOMES FAVOURITE TO WIN THE 
FRAME 
YOU HAVE TO ADMIRE THE WAY FRAME HE PLAYS LIKE YOU I WOULD HAVE 
WORRIED ABOUT THAT LATER 
AGAIN I HAVE SEEN SHOTS LIKE THAT 
RATTLE AND STAY OUT 
EARLY INDICATIONS ARE THE POCKETS 
ARE ACCEPTING THE BALLS WELL 
SOMETIMES IT CHANGES AFTER A FEW 
DAYS WHEN THE CLOTHS GET A LITTLE 
BIT OLDER THE BALLS DON'T SLIDE IN 
QUITE AS COMFORTABLY 
THIS FRAME 
WILL HURT NIGEL MORE THAN ANY OTHER 
FRAME OF THE MATCH SO FAR THE FACT 
HE COULD HAVE WON FRAME THREE WILL 
HAVE HEARD BUT THIS WILL HURT 
WHEN YOU LOSE FRAMES YOU DEFINITELY 
SHOULD WIN THEY HURT A LOT 
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD SHOT YOU SAW 
THE ANGLE HE WAS VIRTUALLY 
STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK TO BE HONEST 
AND HE CREATED AN ANGLE YOU TRY 
THAT IN YOUR CLUB THE SHOT HE JUST 
PLAYED THERE AND A LOT OF TIMES 
YOU WILL MISS THE BLACK OTHER 
TIMES YOU WILL COME WELL SHORT 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE BEST SHOTS IN 
THE MATCH 
THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING 
IT WAS SO STRAIGHT 
THAT WAS A SENSIBLE SHOT HE DID 
NOT PLAY ON A HIGH COLOUR HE WANTS 
IT MAKE HE WANTS IT TO BE EASY TO 
GET FROM FINAL COLOUR TO YELLOW I I THOUGHT HE CUED WELL IN THE FIRST 
FOUR FRAMES 
GENERALLY SPEAKING HE IS A PLAYER 
THAT IS COMING BACK TO FORM 
HE NEEDS UP TO AND INCLUDING THE 
BLUE 
THIS PUTS HIM EIGHTEEN IN FRONT BUT TO BE 
ABSOLUTELY SURE HE NEEDS THE BLUE 
NIGEL HAS TO START TO CONSIDER HOW 
TO STAY IN THE MATCH BY WINNING AT 
LEAST TWO OF THE REMAINING FRAMES 
NEIL ROBERTSON TRAILED BY FORTY EIGHT 
POINTS TO ZERO BUT IN TWO VISITS HE 
NOW LEADS 
IT IS THE FIRST TIME THESE MEN HAVE 
MET AND THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE 
PLAYED EACH OTHER IN LONGER 
FRAMES FORMAT ROBERTS AND IT IS 
LOOKING VERY FLUID 
NEIL ROBERTSON 
QUITE A LONG WAY OUT ON THAT ONE 
ONE OF THE FRAMES WHERE THE BALLS 
HAVE GONE SLIGHTLY TRICKY 
IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT 
DISHEARTENING FOR A PLAYER WHEN 
THE BALLS ARE AWKWARD YOU HAVE TO 
ADAPT YOUR GAME ACCORDINGLY 
EXCELLENT SHOT HE DESERVES TO BE 
ON SOMETHING THERE HE PLAYED THAT 
REALLY WELL YOU GENERATE SO MUCH 
MORE TOP SPIN WITH THAT SHOT WATCH 
THE WAY THE OF WHY IT TAKES OFF HE 
HIT THEM VERY NICELY INDEED THE 
WHITE TAKES OFF 
A GOOD LITTLE SHOT USING THE TWO 
REDS TO SLOW THE CUE BALL DOWN THE 
PINK SPOT IS AVAILABLE BUT I DON'T 
KNOW IF IT WILL BE POTTABLE 
HE WILL TRY AND WIN THE FRAME OF 
JUST PINK AND BLUE IN PLAYING THIS 
RED HE WANTS TO TRY TO LEAVE AN 
ANGLE OF THE PINK JUST TO PUSH INTO 
THOSE TWO REDS CAN HE POT THE RED 
AND GET THAT ANGLE L. DON'T THINK HE CAN 
I WASN'T AWARE THE PINK WOULD BE 
AVAILABLE INTO BOTH POT POCKETS 
THAT DIDN'T QUITE GO FAR ENOUGH BUT 
L. STILL THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT IT'S 
BEEN A GOOD BREAK IT IS GRADUALLY 
GETTING TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN 
IN THE FRAMES 
IT HAS BEEN A WELL CONSTRUCTED 
BREAK IT ALL STARTED HAPPENING FOR 
HIM WHEN HE WENT INTO THE PACK AT 
SPEED 
NIGEL HAS HAD TO SIT OUT A GOOD 
BREAK HERE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
HE THOUGHT IT WAS OVER AS WELL 
BUT THERE IS MORE TO COME IT WILL 
BE A GOOD CENTURY IT EVEN THOUGH 
HE GOT THAT FLUKE 
IT ENDS AT EIGHTY BUT A VERY GOOD BREAK 
IT WAS HE IS NOW FIVE TO ONE UP OVER NIGEL 
NIGEL A LITTLE SHAKEN BUT NOT 
STIRRED BUT FORTY TWO YEAR OLD BOND 
PRODUCED THIS LOVELY CLEARANCE IN 
THE NEXT FRAME THIS WAS A BREAK OF 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE TO REDUCE ARREARS IF YOU 
THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO INCREASE 
HIS MOMENTUM HE HAD OTHER THINGS 
COMING ROBERTSON IT RAINED ON HIS 
PARADE WE ARE NOW INTO THE LAST OF 
THE SESSION BORN TO PLAY WANT 
TO PLAY 
JUST MAKING SURE OF THE BLUE 
DIDN'T WANT TO GO TOO FAR WITH THE 
CUE BALL IT IS WHY HE MISSED IT I 
SUPPOSE IT IS A SCRAPPY FRAME 
THERE 
IT IS ONE THAT NIGEL HAS TO WIN NOW IT WAS A HORRIBLE KICK BUT LUCKILY 
FOR NEIL HE DIDN'T TAKE ANY PACE 
OUT OF THE CUE BALL NORMALLY WHEN 
YOU GET A KICK LIKE THAT THE BLACK 
COULD FLY TOWARDS THE JAWS THIS BLACK PUTS HIM FORTY FOUR IN FRONT 
IN IT GOES AND THIS IS A SESSION 
THAT THE SCORELINE DOES NOT TELL 
THE FULL STORY OFF NIGEL BOND 
WOULD FEEL DISAPPOINTED THAT HE HAS 
NOT GOT AT LEAST TWO MORE FRAMES 
ALTHOUGH ROBINSON HAS MADE BREAKS 
OF FIFTY AND A BATH IN ALL THE FRAMES 
HE HAS ONE NEIL ROBERTSON 
NIGEL BOND GLANCES AT THE SCORE 
BOARD IS HE GOING TO CARRY ON HE 
IS BUT WITHOUT THE THREE OR FOUR 
SNOOKERS HE NEEDS NEIL ROBERTSON 
WILL GO INTO THE NEXT SESSION 
LEADING SEVEN TO TWO 
THAT RATHER TIES UP THIS MORNING'S 
SESSIONS FOR YOU MEANWHILE WE 
HAVE GOT ANDREW DOING THE COACHING 
HERE AND DOING A STERLING JOB HE 
HAS GOT ALL COMERS THERE IT IS 
GOOD TO SEE THE YOUNGSTERS COMING 
DOWN IN TERMS OF YOUNGSTERS WE 
HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT NEIL 
ROBERTSON WAS A FELLOW THAT HAD A 
HUGE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL AFTER HIS 
SEASON LAST TIME HE HAS ONLY WON 
FIVE OUT OF THIRTEEN MATCHES THAT HAS 
SURPRISED A LOT OF PEOPLE 
YES BUT 
IN DEFENCE OF ALL THE PLAYERS THE 
SEASON IS NOT THAT LONG ONLY SEVEN 
TOURNAMENTS IN A YEAR IF YOU START 
TO DO BADLY TO SAY IT IS A BAD 
SEASON WELL IT IS A BAD SIX OR 
SEVEN TOURNAMENTS NEIL ROBERTS HAS 
NOT LOST HIS ABILITY OVERNIGHT HE 
IS PERHAPS JUST TRY TO GET BACK TO 
WHERE HE WAS LAST SEASON 
HE IS 
FANCIED BY SOME AS A BIT OF AN 
OUTSIDER FOR THE TITLE 
HE IS SIXTEEN TO ONE 
SOMETIMES HAVING A SEASON LIKE HE 
HAD LAST YEAR IT BRINGS PRESSURE 
HE HAS GOT HIGH EXPECTATION HE HAS 
HAD A FEW BAD RESULTS IT IS HARD 
TO GET BACK THE ONE THING YOU CAN 
SAY IS THAT HE IS FRESH HE IS NOT 
MENTALLY WORN OUT BY ALL THE 
TOURNAMENTS HE HAS PLAYED IN SO IT 
MIGHT BE THAT THIS NEXT FORTNIGHT 
HE CAN PUT EVERYTHING INTO IT 
IN A 
GENERAL SENSE HE IS NOT SHORT OF 
CONFIDENCE 
IF HE GETS IN FRONT IN CONFIDENCE THIS MATCH AGAINST NIGEL BOND HE 
LOOKS THE REAL DEAL NIGEL IS 
UNLUCKY THE FIRST FRAME CAN MAKE A 
BIG DIFFERENCE NIGEL POTTED A RED 
AND A REDWOOD IN THE POCKET THAT 
SEALED NIGEL'S FATE FOR THE REST OF 
THE DAY 
HE HAS A BIG FIGHT ON HIS 
HANDS TOMORROW ONE PLAYER I LAID 
YOU GENTLEMEN ARE LOOKING FORWARD 
TO IS A PLAYER WHO IMPRESSED US IN 
DECEMBER JAMIE COPE FOREIGN YOUNG 
MAN FROM STOKE HE ALREADY HAS A 
FEARSOME REPUTATION HE IS THE 
SHOTGUN BECAUSE OF HIS STYLE SO IT 
DOES SEEM STRANGE THAT THIS IS THE 
FIRST TIME HE HAS MANAGED TO 
QUALIFY FOR THE CRUCIBLE 
I HAVE BEEN HERE TO WATCH A COUPLE 
OF TIMES IT IS A GOOD ATMOSPHERE 
IN THERE L. FELT GREAT ARRIVING I 
HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO IT FOR 
A WHILE IT IS DIFFERENT FEELING 
KNOWING WHAT HAS GONE HERE OVER THE 
YEARS I CAN'T WAIT TO GO OUT THERE 
YOU SET YOURSELF A TARGET JUST AS 
A TREAD ON THE FIRST MATCH SETTLE 
DOWN QUICKLY AND PLACE IN GOODS AND 
SNOOKER 
WE HAVE GOT HIM UP AGAINST A FORMER 
CHAMPION PETER EBDON 
WE HAVE GOT A WILY MATCHPLAY 
AGAINST A FEARLESS POTTER IT IS 
GOING TO BE FASCINATING HOW WILL 
JAMIE COPE 
GOOD AFTERNOON YOU JOIN US THERE 
AS JIMMY MISSED A TRICKY RED INTO 
THE MIDDLE POCKET JAMIE UP 
UNTIL THEN HE LOOKED IN TERRIFIC 
FORM IT WAS A GREAT START BUT HE 
WILL BE DISAPPOINTED HE DIDN'T 
SCORE MORE FROM THAT 
THE WAY JIMMY PLAYED THAT POT HE 
WAS NICELY ON THE BLACK PETER 
EBDON'S OPENING ATTEMPT WAS A MILE 
AWAY FROM THE POCKET 
TRYING TO GET THE SNOOKER IN BEHIND 
THE BLACK 
NOT A LOT ON FOR JAMIE HERE IF HE 
GOES INTO THE BAULK AREA HE HAS 
ONE TO THE RIGHT OF THE GREEN 
HE COULD HAVE PUT HIMSELF IN A BIT 
OF TROUBLE HERE HE WAS TRYING TO 
GET TIGHT ON THE CUSHION IT WASN'T 
EASY SAFETY SHOT FOR PETER EBDON 
IF HE CAN GET THE WHITE TIGHT ON 
THE CUSHION SOMEWHERE BEHIND THE 
BLACK IT WILL BE ADVANTAGE EBDON 
I AM NOT SAYING IT WAS THE WRONG 
SHOT HE PLAYED BUT IN THE LEAD IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS PETER PETER HAS PLAYED A PRETTY POOR SHOT THERE 
STILL TRYING TO GET USED TO THE 
PACE OF THE TABLE 
THAT WAS A HALF ATTEMPT YOU WOULD 
HAVE TO SAY SEEING WHERE HE HAS 
PLACED THE CUE BALL PETER MIGHT BE 
FORCED INTO TAKING THIS RED ON HE 
WILL HAVE A LITTLE THINK AND IF HE 
DOESN'T SEE A SAFETY SHOT HE MIGHT 
RISK THIS 
HE WOULD MUCH RATHER PLAY THE 
SAFETY SHOT BUT IT MAY HAVE TO BE 
THE RISKY POT 
THAT IS PRETTY GOOD IN FACT IT IS 
VERY GOOD 
NOW JIMMY IS IN TROUBLE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN THIS FRAME JAMIE 
HE FEELS THE BAULK CUSHION IS THE 
BEST PLACE TO TRY AND LEAVE THE CUE 
BALL HE HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL HERE 
HE IS NOT GUARANTEED TO GET THIS 
SAFE 
WITH ALL THE REDS UP THE OTHER END 
OF THE TABLE THE FORTY ONE ADVANTAGE IS 
QUITE A LEAD IF PETER GETS IN HE 
WILL HAVE TO BE TAKING BAULK 
COLOURS 
HE WOULD VIRTUALLY NEED COLOURS EVERY RED 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE JUST PLAYED 
THE SAFETY SHOT THERE WHETHER 
STARTED THE LAST SEASON VERY WELL 
AND JUST LOST HIS WAY A LITTLE BIT 
THIS SEASON JAMIE COPE VERY 
IMPRESSED WITH HIM WHEN HE GOT TO A 
COUPLE OF RANKING FINALS LIKE A 
LOT OF THE YOUNG GUNS HE TENDS TO 
PUSH THE BOAT OUT A BIT MORE THAN 
MOST MAYBE ONE REASON WHY HE LOSES 
A FEW MATCHES HE SHOULDN'T DO BUT 
HE IS DEFINITELY A STAR OF THE 
FUTURE 
I LOVE THE WAY HE PLAYS HE FUTURE IS A FANTASTIC POTTER VERY 
EXCITING TO WATCH AND I THINK HE 
IS THE ONLY PLAYER THAT HAS MADE A 
COMPLETE MAXIMUM BREAK ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE IN 
PRACTICE 
HE MAY HAVE A PATH THROUGH TO THE 
RED IN THE LEFT CORNER POCKET HE 
HAS GOT AN EASY SAFETY SHOT ON BUT 
IF ANYTHING HE WILL TAKE IT ON 
THESE TABLES LOOK TO BE PLAYING 
BEAUTIFULLY LOOK AT THAT SHOT HE 
HAS HARDLY HIT ITS OF COURSE YOU 
NEED THE CUE ACTION TO CALL THAT 
SHOT OFF PAUL THAT SHOT OFF 
NOT A BAD WAY TO START TO WIN YOUR 
FIRST EVER FRAME AT THE CRUCIBLE 
THEATRE IT LOOKS AS IF HE'S GOING 
TO DO THAT 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
STATISTICS OF FIRST TIME PLAYERS AT 
THE CRUCIBLE VERY FEW HAVE WON 
THEIR OPENING FRAME AND VERY FEW 
HAVE WON THEIR OPENING MATCH OVER 
THE YEARS CAN WIN YOU HAVE GOT A 
ROOKIE I THINK ONLY ABOUT TEN PER 
CENT OF PLAYERS HAVE WON THEIR 
OPENING MATCH 
THIS GUY COULD GO ON TO THE 
QUARTER FINALS HE IS GOOD ENOUGH 
HE JUST LET HIMSELF RUN SLIGHTLY 
OUT OF POSITION 
HE HAS PLAYED THAT PERFECTLY LOOK 
WHERE THE WHITE HAS FINISHED 
HE IS NOT OVER THE WINNING LINE YET 
AND HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF HAMPERED 
HE NEEDS RED COLOUR RED TO BE 
SURE OF THIS OPENING FRAME 
THIS FRAME IS STILL ALIVE 
THAT WAS 
A BIT OF A NERVY ONE FROM JAMIE 
THERE HE KNEW THAT WOULD HAVE 
CLINCHED THE FRAME FOR HIM 
IT IS A VERY BIG ASK FOR PETER 
EBDON SIXTY TWO BEHIND 
HE COULD DO WITH GETTING ON HIGHER 
VALUE COLOURS 
THAT IS NOT BAD THE GREEN IS O. K. 
FOR HIM 
THIS IS THE RED THAT WILL CERTAINLY 
GET HIM INTO OPEN PLAY BY A 
STAGGERING BACK BY SCREWING BACK 
NOT A GOOD CONTACT THE CUE BALL 
BOUNCED 
MIGHT JUST WORK TO HIS BOUNCED ADVANTAGE HE HAS GOT AN ANGLE ON 
THE BROWN IF HE WANTS TO TAKE IT ON 
AND FREE THE DIFFICULT RED THAT IS 
BY THE SIDE CUSHION THERE IT IS A 
DISTINCT POSSIBILITY 
I LIKE THAT 
SHOT I THINK THAT IS WHAT HE WILL 
PLAY 
JUST PUSHED IT A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR 
SLIGHTLY EASIER THERE AND THE RED 
WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER THE MIDDLE 
POCKET IT DOES HELP THAT IT IS NOT 
AS DIFFICULT AS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY 
IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT FRAME THE 
OPENING FRAME IT SOMEHOW PETER 
COULD CLAW HIS WAY BACK AND WIN IT 
AFTER THE START HE HAD WOULD PAVE 
THE WAY FOR HIM TO SETTLE DOWN 
SIMILAR SCENARIO HERE HE COULD 
PLAY THE BROWN 
THAT IS TWICE HE HAS PLAYED A 
CANNON AND BOTH TIMES HAVEN'T 
WORKED IT WILL CUT THIS ONE BUT 
IT IS TOUGH 
I THINK HE MIGHT BE O. K. 
HE COULD FINISH ON THE BLACK HE HAS GOT TO START PUTTING THE 
HIGHER VALUE COLOURS WITH THE 
DEFICIT 
TO GET ONTO THE BLACK HE DEFICIT IS GOING TO HAVE TO SCREW IT 
HOPEFULLY HE WILL STRAIGHTEN IT UP 
A LITTLE BIT IT JUST OVERRAN IT 
SLIGHTLY HE COULD MISS THIS 
THAT IS A POSSIBILITY THE POT IS 
THE ALL IMPORTANT THING 
A BIT UNLUCKY YOU KNOW HE ALMOST 
BROUGHT THAT INTO PLAY 
WHAT A 
GREAT EFFORT IF HE DID GET THAT 
KISS HE WOULD HAVE GONE FAVOURITE 
TO WIN THE FRAME HE IS STILL 
SECOND FAVOURITE NOW WHERE THE 
BALLS OFF BUT WHAT AN EFFORT THAT 
WAS 
IT IS ONE OF THOSE SHOTS THIS ONE 
WHERE IT TEN OUT OF TEN COMEDY WOULD 
POT IT IF YOU WERE NOT HAVE 
WORRIED ABOUT LEAVING THE OTHER ONE 
IN THE MIDDLE 
HE NEEDS TO STAY ON THE PINK OR 
BLACK HERE HE COULD AFFORD TO TAKE 
THE BLUE OFF THIS RED BUT THEN HE 
WOULD NEED A BLACK WITH THE LAST 
REMAINING RED L. THINK HE WOULD SETTLE FOR JUST POTTING THIS ONE 
THE WAY HE PLAYED IT NOW THIS RED 
IS POTTABLE IN THE MIDDLE JAMIE 
NEEDS IT AS FRAME BALL HE MIGHT 
DROP THIS IN ABSOLUTELY DEAD WEIGHT 
BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT IF HE MISSES 
IT IT WILL BE TOUGH TO CLEAR 
HE HAD A QUICK GLANCE ROUND AT THE 
SCOREBOARD AND HE KNOWS HE IS 
VIRTUALLY SAFE NOW IN THIS OPENING 
FRAME 
WITH IT BEING THE OPENING FRAME 
PETER WILL CARRY ON BUT A GOOD 
START FOR THE YOUNG MAN 
THAT WAS A JAMIE COPE SPECIAL THAT 
IS THE TYPE OF THING THIS YOUNG MAN 
DOES TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT IS 
AN INDICATION THAT HE HAS SETTLED 
HERE HE DID LOSE A FIVE WANT TO PETER 
IN CHINA ARE NOT SO LONG AGO BUT I 
THINK THE YOUNG PLAYER IS UP FOR 
THIS ONE HE HAS A LOT OF SUPPORT 
HERE 
WHEN THE PLAYERS WERE INTRODUCED 
HE GOT A BIG ROAR FROM HIS PALS TO 
HAVE TRAVELLED FROM STOKE TO WATCH 
HIM PLAY VIEWERS AT HOME WILL 
ENJOY WATCHING HIM PLAY 
IT HAS BEEN A VERY GOOD OPENING 
FRAME A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS FROM 
BOTH PLAYERS BUT THAT EARLIER 
BREAK OF FORTY ONE PAGE OF THE WAY TO GIVE 
JAMIE COPE THE OPENING FRAME 
PAVED THE WAY 
THAT WAS AN INTERESTING OPENING 
FRAME PETER LOOKED LITTLE BIT 
SHAKY IN FACT HIS FIRST ATTEMPT TO 
POT THE RED THIS WAS THE ONE HE 
MISSED IT BY A LONG WAY THAT CAN 
HAPPEN IN YOUR OPENING FRAME BUT 
VERY DIFFICULT TO CALL THIS ONE L. 
THINK THE YOUNG MAN ON THE RIGHT IS 
GOING TO HAVE GOOD WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP HERE 
THE REFEREE ALAN CHAMBERLAIN JUST 
COMPLETING THE SET UP OF THE BALLS 
PETER EBDON BREAKS OFF IN THE 
SECOND FRAME AND HE KNOWS HE HAS 
GOT A YOUNG MAN IN FORM ALTHOUGH 
PETER DID BEAT JAMIE COPE ENTIRE 
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO IN CHINA 
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO SO HE WILL 
KNOW A LOT ABOUT JAMIE HE HAS BEEN 
ON THE SCENE FOR A FEW YEARS HE 
WILL KNOW WHAT A GREAT POTTER HE IS 
BUT MAYBE PETER CAN BRING HIS 
EXPERIENCE AND MATCH PLAYED TO THE 
TABLE WHICH WILL SLOPE JAMIE DOWN 
SLOWLY JAMIE DOWN 
EXCELLENT SAFETY SHOT FROM JAMIE 
AND THAT IS WHAT HE HAS TO DO IF HE 
IS GOING TO WIN THIS MATCH COMPETE 
WITH PETER IN THE SAFETY DEPARTMENT 
THE KEY FOR ME IN THIS MATCH IS HE 
WILL HAVE TO COMPETE WITH EBDON IN 
ALL DEPARTMENTS SHOULD HE GO ON TO 
WIN THIS MATCH WILL STOP THIS IS A 
RISKY ONE 
HE GOT AWAY WITH THAT BUT HE WAS A 
LONG WAY OFF THAT ATTEMPT ALSO HE 
HAS DONE WELL FOR THE WHITE TO 
FINISH UP IN THAT POSITION IT 
COULD HAVE GONE ANYWHERE 
THAT WAS ANOTHER JAMIE COPE SPECIAL 
FANTASTIC LONG POT THAT GOOD 
BRIDGING ON THE CUSHION 
HE WILL HAVE TO CONCENTRATE ON PINK 
AND BLUE LOOK WHERE THE WHITE IS 
GOING HE WILL HAVE TO CONCENTRATE 
ON TRYING TO GET OUT OF TROUBLE 
UNLESS HE CAN PASS THE PINK IS HE 
O. K. HE MIGHT JUST BE 
BUT LOOK AT THE BLACK SURROUNDED 
WITH REDS 
I THINK HE HAS RUN OUT OF POSITION 
HE HAS EVER DONE THAT L. L. DON'T 
THINK THERE IS A POT ON FOR HIM 
OVER DONE THAT 
THAT WAS A BIT CARELESS FROM JAMIE THAT LITTLE FLICK ON THE BROWN HAS 
GIVEN PETER EBDON A SLIGHTLY BIGGER 
TARGET HE CAN SPLIT THE THREE REDS 
IT IS ALL ABOUT FRACTIONS THIS 
GAME THAT WAS A BIG TARGET HE 
DIDN'T GET IT THOUGH 
NOT QUITE THE SNOOKER ONE RED THAT 
JIMMY CAN HIT JAMIE 
NOT A LOT OF VALUE IN ATTEMPTING TO 
POT THIS 
THAT LOOKED VERY CLOSE EBDON'S 
ATTEMPT 
THE BOY IS IN FORM AT THE MOMENT 
HE IS KNOCKING EVERYTHING IN THAT 
IS THE ONLY PROBLEM IF YOU PLAY A 
POT TO NOTHING IF YOU GET THE SHOT 
YOU GET A GOOD WHITE DIDN'T GO THROUGH THAT VERY NICELY 
IT HAS GONE VERY AWKWARD THIS 
FRAME IT IS EARLY TO SAY BUT JAMIE 
DOESN'T WANT TO GET TIED DOWN IN 
THIS SORT OF GAME 
IT IS JUST THE WAY THE FRAME HAS 
GONE PETER DOESN'T MIND DOING A 
BIT OF GRINDING HE IS QUITE A 
PROLIFIC BREAK BUILDER 
CAN HE GET THROUGH TO THIS RED HE 
HASN'T KNOCKED IN LONG ONE IN YET 
PETER IN LONG ONE HE'S USUALLY 
PRETTY GOOD AT THIS TYPE OF SHOT 
HE DOESN'T HAVE A DECENT ANGLE ON 
THE GREEN OR YELLOW TO GET PERFECT 
ANGLE SO HE WILL HAVE TO PLAY WITH 
PACE 
LOOK AT THE PACE HE HAD TO PUT IN 
TO GENERATE THE TOP SPIN THAT WAS 
AN EXCELLENT SHOT A LITTLE BIT 
UNLUCKY HE GOT TOO MUCH INTO IT 
HE HAS GOT THE POT ON BUT IT IS ALL 
ABOUT THE WHITE BALL IT IS HEADING 
TOWARDS THE CLUSTER OF REDS THAT 
ARE COVERING THE BLACK THIS IS HIT AND HOPE TIME 
IT IS NOT BAD FROM PETER EBDON'S 
POINT OF VIEW HE MAY HAVE PUSHED A 
PLANT ON AND LEFT A POT ON BUT THE 
RED INTO THE LEFT CORNER IT WILL 
CANNON INTO OTHER REDS IT WILL 
CERTAINLY DISTURB THINGS 
IT HAS TURNED OUT VERY NICELY THAT 
IS AN EXCELLENT SHOT THE SPIN TOOK 
HOLD THE CUE BALL 
THAT APPEARED TO FLY OFF THE 
CUSHION A LITTLE BIT THERE JAMIE JAMIE JUST STOPPED IN HIS TRACKS AND 
MOMENT A MOMENT 
IF HE POTS THE YELLOW HE HAS TO 
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T CANNONED THE 
BROWN 
THAT WAS VERY CARELESS I THINK HE 
WAS THINKING MORE ABOUT THE CANNON 
ON TO THE BROWN HE SHOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT ABOUT THE YELLOW 
THINGS ARE STILL AWKWARD WITH THE 
BLACK AND REDS ANYTHING ABOVE ZERO FROM HERE WILL BE GOOD 
I DIDN'T FANCY THAT MYSELF IT WAS 
THE RIGHT SHOT TO PLAY BECAUSE IT 
WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM THE CHANCE TO 
SCORE HEAVILY 
AS IT HAS TURNED OUT 
IT HAS GIVEN JAMIE COPE A TERRIFIC 
CHANCE 
HE WILL HAVE TO DO IT MOSTLY OF THE 
PINK OFF THE PINK 
HE IS QUITE A TALL LAD JAMIE HE 
HAS JUST OVER DONE IT AGAIN 
THE PLAYERS ALL SEEN FIT THESE DAYS 
A BIT LIKE OURSELVES 
THE SAME 
AMOUNT OF LETTERS BUT A DIFFERENT 
MIDDLE ONE 
THE HE DIDN'T HIT THAT VERY WELL 
HE WANTED TO BE ANOTHER EIGHTEEN INCHES 
FURTHER UP THE TABLE THAT IS A 
SIGN OF A LITTLE BIT OF ANXIETY 
WHEN YOU DON'T FOLLOW THROUGH AS 
YOU INTEND 
IT IS AMAZING WHEN YOU RUN SLIGHTLY 
OUT OF POSITION 
IF PETER CAN GET THROUGH TO THE RED 
TO RIGHT OF THE PINK IT MAY BE 
WORTH PLAYING THE POT HE COULD 
PLAY AS A SHOT TO NOTHING ALL WITH 
THE BROWN BEING AS IT IS 
PETER EBDON IS ACTUALLY COLOUR 
BLIND HE JUST SAID TO ALAN 
CHAMBERLAIN IS THAT THE RED OR THE 
BROWN CHAMBERLAIN SAID THAT IS 
THE BROWN L. DON'T KNOW WHETHER 
VIEWERS ARE AWARE THAT EBDON IS 
COLOUR BLIND HE WAS JUST CHECKING 
IT WASN'T THE BROWN 
THAT THE GREAT THING FOR BUDDING 
SNOOKER PLAYERS ALWAYS LOOK FOR 
THINGS ABOUT THAT THINGS LIKE 
THAT HE WAS SURE TO BE ON THE 
BLACK IF HE GOT THE KISS RIGHT AND 
IF HE MISSED BECAUSE THE WHITE 
WOULD HAVE GONE ON TO THE BROWN SO 
THERE ALWAYS TIMES IN BREAK 
BUILDING 
THIS SHOT IS MADE A LITTLE EASIER 
OF THE FACT THAT THE RED IS OVER 
THE CORNER HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE EASY BROWN 
GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT 
NOW BECAUSE OF THE POSITIONAL SIDE 
OF THE SHOT IS IMPORTANT TO GIVE 
HIM A CHANCE TO GET TO ONE OF THE 
THREE DIFFICULT REDS HE IS 
GOING 
TO HAVE TO TRY TO GET 
ON THE ONE UP TO THE LEFT OF THE 
BLUE AND THE YELLOW THINK HE HAS A SLIGHT ANGLE ON THE PINK THAT WAS LIKE A PUNCH SHOT 
IDEALLY HE WOULD LIKE TO GET ONTO 
THE BLUE AND TRY TO CANNON THAT TWO 
REDS BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE THE ANGLE 
BUT TWO REDS 
I SUPPOSE YOU CAN HAVE SECOND BEST 
YOU CAN PUT JAMIE IN ALL SORTS OF 
TROUBLE HE DID NOT SEEM TO GET ANY 
SCREW IN THAT 
I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN GO TWICE HE 
MIGHT HAVE TO GO OFF A COUPLE OF 
CUSHIONS 
HE'S TRYING TO GET IN BEHIND THE 
REDS OFFERED THREE CUSHIONS OFF 
OR THREE CUSHIONS 
ONCE YOU HAVE CALLED A MISS IN THAT 
SITUATION HE'S GOT TO KEEP CALLING 
IT SUPPOSE THE REFEREE IS RIGHT 
GOOD SHOT THAT PETER DOESN'T WANT 
TO MOVE THE RED TOO FAR IT WILL 
MAKE THE OTHER ONE POTTABLE HE HAS 
TO BE CAREFUL HERE THAT COULD HAVE 
COST HIM THE FRAME 
IT IS A FOUL 
IT IS A MISS IT IS A FREE BALL HE 
HAS THE LOT 
PETER WAS TRYING TO NUDGE THE RED 
SO HE WOULDN'T LEAVE A POSSIBLE POT 
ON IF HE DIDN'T GET THE SNOOKER 
PLENTY OF ADVANTAGE PLAYING THE 
BROWN INTO THE BLACK POCKET THERE 
IS NO POINT IN PLAYING ANYTHING 
OTHER THAN POT 
HE COULD ALWAYS TAKE THE BROWN INTO 
THE MIDDLE POCKET AND TRY TO LEAVE 
AN ANGLE ON THE COLOURS BUT IT IS 
FAR FROM EASY 
WHAT A HEAVY CONTACT THAT WAS WHAT 
A KICK 
I HAD THE PLEASURE OF DOING THE 
MORNING MATCH TODAY WITH NEIL 
ROBERTSON AND NIGEL BOND I DON'T 
THINK WE HAD ONE KICK WE'VE 
ALREADY HAD TWO THIS AFTERNOON 
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN THERE IS NO 
REASON THESE TABLES SHOULDN'T BE 
ABSOLUTELY LEVEL BECAUSE WE HAVE A 
NEW FLOOR IN THE CRUCIBLE IT IS 
EASIER TO GET THE TABLE THEREFORE 
BECAUSE FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN IT WAS ON A 
SPRUNG FLOOR AND THEY HAD SPECIAL 
JACQUES BUT IT IS A COMPLETELY NEW 
FLOOR SO NO REASON WHY THE TABLE 
SHOULD NOT BE LEVEL 
WHY DIDN'T 
THEY HAVE FRED'S WHY WAS IT JUST 
JACKS 
WE DID HAVE A GREAT JACK A 
DELIGHTFUL COMMENTATOR 
WHAT A GOOD 
EFFORT A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF PACE 
BUT THIS HAS PUT JAMIE IN TROUBLE 
THAT BROWN IS NOT COMPLETELY 
BLOCKING THE CORNER POCKET 
IT IS DEBATABLE AS TO WHETHER IT 
WOULD HIT THE CUSHION GOING OFF THE 
BROWN HE WOULD HAVE TO BE VERY 
PRECISE HE'S COMING TO HAVE A LOOK 
IT IS RISKY 
HE WOULD HAVE TO REALLY HIT THE 
CORNER OF THE POCKET ON THE RIGHT 
SIDE FOR IT TO GO IN OFF THE BROWN 
NEVER GOING TO GET THAT FROM THAT 
DISTANCE WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT 
WAS POSSIBLY THE WRONG CHOICE OF 
SHOT THERE 
I LOVED WATCHING HIM 
PLAY BUT HE THROWS SO MANY FRAMES 
AWAY BY LOVE WATCHING HIM FROM 
ALMOST NOT BEING PATIENT AT ALL IF 
HE HAD PLAYED THAT SHOT ONE HUNDRED TIMES 
HE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY GOT IT ONCE 
DOWN THE CUSHION IT WAS FIFTY FIFTY 
FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE IT 
WAS MASSIVE ODDS AGAINST 
ONE THING YOU DON'T DO AGAINST 
PETER EBDON ONCE AGAIN HE HAS 
LOST THE WHITE I'M AFRAID HE'S 
TWITCHING AT THE MOMENT 
JAMIE COPE MAY GET ANOTHER BITE AT 
THE CHERRY 
ARE YOU SAYING THAT WAS 
THE CRUCIBLE TWITCHED THERE HAVE 
BEEN A FEW OF THOSE DOWN THE YEARS 
IF I COULD HAVE A TENNER FOR 
EVERYONE PUT ME DOWN FOR ABOUT SEVENTY 
IS THAT ALL 
THAT'S ONE THING ABOUT EBDON 
WHATEVER SHOT HE PLAYS HE WILL 
GIVE ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT ON THE NEXT SHOT SOME 
PLAYERS WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED GET 
OUT QUICKLY 
HE TAKES HIS TIME HE DIDN'T GET NEAR THE RED HE 
TRIED TO COME OF TWO CUSHIONS AND 
HIT THE RED FROM BEHIND TO COME 
OFF 
HE PLAYED IT WELL IN FACT HE MAY 
HAVE GOT A SNOOKER PERFECTION 
MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO PLAY THIS WORLD 
DENNIS 
YOU CAN GO DOWN THE LEFT DENNIS SIDE NOT THE RIGHT SIDE BECAUSE OF 
THE GREEN AND BROWN 
PLAYED ACE 
WORTH IT 
IF HE POTS IT HE WILL FINISH ON 
BLACK OR BLUE ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO 
JUDGE THE ANGLE RONNIE'S ORNETTE 
THESE JUDGE THE ANGLE ON THESE 
JAIME HAS TRIED TO GIVE PETER A 
LIFELINE IN THIS FRAME ON A COUPLE 
OF OCCASIONS HE HAS EVERY CHANCE 
NOW OF SECURING THE FRAME VERY 
RARELY AGAINST SOMEONE OF PETER'S 
CLASS WOULD YOU GET THREE OR FOUR 
CHANCES BUT THAT HAS HAPPENED IN 
THIS GAME 
A DEAD STRAIGHT ON THE GREEN WOULD 
BE PERFECT HE LOOKED AT THE SCORE 
BOARD LA MIKE THERE 
HE PLAYED TO LEAVE THE BROWN IN THE 
LEFT MIDDLE POCKET AND HE UNDERHIT 
THAT THAT WAS SIGN OF TENSION 
JAMIE HOW MANY CHANCES DO YOU WANT 
TO WIN THE FRAME 
FOR ME HE TOOK 
TOO LONG OVER THAT HE NORMALLY 
DOESN'T DO THAT 
THAT WILL BE A BLOW ALTHOUGH IT IS 
THE BEST OF NINETEEN IF HE GOES TO ZERO UP 
HE WILL SETTLE DOWN 
BUT HE IS NOT CUEING WELL HERE 
PETER 
IN FAIRNESS THE PACE THAT PETER JAMIE PLAYED THE BROWN HE WAS A 
LITTLE FORTUNATE NOT TO HAVE LEFT 
THE BROWN EASIER FOR PETER L. DON'T 
THINK HE HAS POTTED ONE LONG BALL 
IN THE OPENING FRAME AND A HALF 
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT THIS IS ONE 
OF THOSE WHERE DE DO NOT WANT TO 
HIT IT ON THE WAY DOWN YOU DO 
NOT WANT TO HIT IT 
A SIMILAR ONE 
TO THE WHY HE HIT ON THE RED WHERE 
HE ENDED UP GETTING THE SNOOKER 
I THINK THAT WAS THE WRONG CHOICE 
HE SHOULD HAVE COME OFF TWO 
CUSHIONS THERE L. THINK JAMIE MIGHT 
JUST LEAVE THEM AS THEY ARE WITH 
THE PINK GOING SAFE 
WHAT IF HE MISSES THE SNOOKER AND 
GOES TWENTY THREE IN FRONT WHAT DO YOU DO 
HE IS LOOKING AROUND AT THE 
SCOREBOARD NOW THE PINK IS SAFE 
BUT I THINK IF HE PUTS PETER BACK 
IN HE WILL MOST PLAY THIS SWERVE 
SHOT HE WILL GO THE OTHER WAY IF IF HE HITS THE BROWN HE MAY LEAVE THE 
BROWN ON SO MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE 
THE BALLS REPLACED 
THAT IS WHAT HE 
HAS DECIDED AFTER THINKING LONG AND 
HARD ABOUT IT WE WILL FIND THAT 
VERY SHORTLY IF IT WAS THE RIGHT 
WRIST BECAUSE THE PINK WAS 
PERFECTLY SAFE IF PETER EBDON DOES 
ESCAPE AND GET IT SAFE IT IS THE 
WRONG CHOICE 
IF THERE WAS ONLY SIXTEEN 
IT IN IT I WOULD HAVE LEFT THE 
PINK WHERE IT IS BUT THE FACT THAT 
THERE IS NINETEEN IN IT I THINK THERE IS 
MORE ADVANTAGE IN HAVING THEM 
REPLACED 
HE IS COMING OFF THE TWO CUSHIONS 
THIS TIME LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
THE SITUATION NOW IS IF HE TRIES 
TO POT THIS BROWN AND MISSES IT HE 
CAN CLEAR UP 
IT IS A RELATIVELY EASY SAFETY SHOT 
FOR PETER IF HE PLAYS IT THEN 
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE WHERE IF HE 
JUST PLAYS THE POT JAMIE COPE WILL 
PEEVE PETER KNEW THAT WAS A 
PIVOTAL POINT HE HAS NOT MADE JANE 
WE SUFFER 
JAMIE PETER EBDON 
KNOWS THAT NORMALLY HE WOULD KNOCK 
THIS BROWN IN BUT LET'S SEE HOW HE 
DOES STRAIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
POCKET LOOKS LIKE TO JUST ZERO TO 
ME TWO TO ZERO 
PETER EBDON KNEW HE WAS 
IN FOREIGN MATCH HE IS DEFINITELY 
IN FOR A MATCH NOW 
I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE SHOT 
THERE IS TWENTY THREE THE DIFFERENCE HE 
NEEDS SNOOKER TO TIE WOULDN'T PUSH THE BLUE OVER THE POCKET 
THE BLACK IS PERFECTLY PLACED IF HE 
DOES GET A CHANCE PETER EBDON TO 
GET THE SNOOKER IN BEHIND 
IF THAT BLUE HAD STAYED OVER THE 
POCKET HE COULD HAVE POTTED THE 
BLUE 
HE CAN'T SEE THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF 
THE BLUE AS WE LOOK SO IT IS NOT 
ON 
WHAT A DRIVE THIS IS WHAT AN 
EFFORT UNLUCKY THAT WAS BRILLIANT 
THAT WAS SUCH A GOOD SHOT 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY TOUGH 
SNOOKER TO HIT IF HE HAD GOT TYPE 
IN BEHIND THE BLACK TIGHT YOU 
ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE IF YOU RISK 
POTTING THE BLUE 
I STILL WOULDN'T 
MIND PUTTING THE BLUE HERE HE MAY 
BE TRYING TO GET IN BEHIND THE 
BLACK AGAIN NO HE IS POTTING THE 
BLUE HE ONLY GETS ONE CHANCE BUT 
HE ONLY NEEDS ONE SNOOKER TO WIN 
RATHER THAN TIGHT HE COULD SCREW 
IN BEHIND THIS BLACK IT IS A 
DELICATE SHOT BUT IT IS ON 
GOOD EFFORT 
THE REASON ARE DENNIS 
SAID THAT YOU ONLY GET ONE CHANCE 
BECAUSE JAMIE CAN NOW ROLL THE PINK 
DEAD WEIGHT PUSH IT RIGHT OVER THE 
POCKET 
WHERE THE BLACK IS IT IS NOT BAD 
TO GET A SNOOKER L. WOULD ALMOST 
RATHER HAVE IT THERE THAN ON ITS 
SPOT 
ABSOLUTELY NEARER THE SPOT CUSHION IS BETTER 
HE WILL STILL BE A BIT ANXIOUS 
JAMIE BECAUSE HE KNOWS THIS FRAME 
AS FAR FROM OVER THIS IS WEIGHT HE 
IS TAKING A BIT OF TIME THIS IS 
WHY 
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS HE IS GOING TO 
BE UNLUCKY WHAT A GREAT SHOT 
DOESN'T WANT THE PINK TO GO IN CAN 
YOU BELIEVE IT EVEN AT PETER EBDON 
HAS TO SMILE THAT WAS SO UNLUCKY 
CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT HAS JUST 
HAPPENED 
ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING HAPPENED SHOTS I HAVE EVER SEEN AT THE 
CRUCIBLE JAMIE COPE GOES TO DO ZERO 
IN FRONT 
I THINK THAT PROBABLY SUMS UP THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE THAT SHOT 
AND AN EARLIER SITUATION THE KEY 
TO THIS MATCH HIS TACTICAL 
INEXPERIENCE AND THE WILY OLD HEAD 
OF PETER EBDON WHAT DO THIS 
INCIDENT EARLIER ON TELL YOU THE THE DISCUSSION WE WERE HAVING EARLY ON 
IS WHEN A JAMIE COPE DECIDED TO 
REPLACE THE BALLS WHEN THE PINK WAS 
ON THE SIDE CUSHION JAMIE THAT 
EFFECTIVELY HAS THE PINK BALL SAFE 
HE ONLY NEEDS ONE OF THE BALLS HE 
WAS HOPING THAT PETER EBDON WOULD 
GET OUT OF THE SNOOKER NEXT TIME 
AND LEAVE THE BROWN ONE WE WERE 
BOTH TALKING IN THE STUDIO AND 
WHEN HE PUT IT BACK WE WERE 
EXASPERATED 
A FEW MISSES AS EXASPERATED SNOOKER WHEN HE IS TWENTY THREE IN FRONT BUT 
THERE IS NO WAY HE'S GOING TO MISS 
THAT SNOOKER IF HE HITS IT FROM 
BEHIND FERRIS GOT A CHANCE IN A 
MILLION I WOULD HAVE BEEN ASKING TO 
PUT THE BALLS BACK THAT PINK IS 
YOUR INSURANCE POLICY L. WAS 
SURPRISED THAT HE START COME BACK 
IN TO BAT 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
WAS A STEAM ROLLER OF A PLAYER 
JAMIE IT WAS MAYBE HE LOSES FRAMES 
TACTICALLY WHAT A GREAT TRY THAT 
WAS AT THE END HE WAS SO UNLUCKY 
BUT HE LOOKS A BIT SHOCKED HE HAS 
NOT HAD A GREAT SEASON PETER IF 
HE GETS OFF TO A BAD START HE MAY 
HAVE TO BE DIGGING HIMSELF OUT OF A 
WHOLE 
A REAL CONTRAST IN STYLES L. WHOLE I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE PLAYED BEFORE 
IN CHINA THEY PLAYED COUPLE OF 
WEEKS AGO BUT I DON'T REMEMBER 
THEM PLATE TOO MUCH BEFORE PETER 
WILL WANT TO STAMP HIS AUTHORITY ON 
HIM BUT I DON'T THINK JAMIE COPE 
IS THE TYPE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING 
HE IS DESPERATELY UNLUCKY THERE 
PETER ONE OF THE BEST SHOTS WE 
HAVE SEEN TODAY 
HOW WARY WHEN A 
PLAYER LIKE PETER EBDON BE BECAUSE 
YOU HAVE TO JUST LOOK BACK TO THE 
U. K. CHAMPIONSHIPS WHEN IT THIS 
FELLOW STEAMROLLERED HIGGINS IN THE 
FIRST ROUND HE DOES HAVE A 
REPUTATION 
WHEN YOU'RE NOT PLAYING REPUTATION WELL YOURSELF PLAYER LIKE JAMIE 
COPE IS THE LAST PLAYER YOU WANT TO 
PLAY YOU CANNOT PLAY YOURSELF INTO 
THE GAME 
WE ARE BACK INTO FRAME 
THREE 
VERY INTERESTING AS 
ALWAYS FROM OF THE BOYS IN THE 
STUDIO HE WAS REMARKABLY UNLUCKY 
THERE AT THE END OF THAT FRAME 
PETER EBDON HE WILL HAVE FORGOTTEN 
ABOUT THAT VERY EXPERIENCED 
CAMPAIGNER BUT HE HAS GOT TO START 
PLAYING A BIT BETTER HE IS NOT 
CUEING ALL THAT WELL AT THE MOMENT 
ANOTHER MISTAKE FROM PETER EBDON 
THE BLACK AND PINK ARE SAFE PLENTY 
OF REDS ARE AVAILABLE THE BLUE IS 
AVAILABLE 
JAMIE HASN'T QUITE SETTLED YET HE 
HAS FINISHED THE WRONG SIDE OF THE 
BLUE THERE 
HE HAS GOT PLENTY OF CUE POWER 
THIS YOUNG PLAYER HIS IDEA HE 
WOULD BE TO GET ONTO A RED AND GET 
ONTO THE BLUE IN SUCH A WAY THAT HE 
COULD CANNON THE PINKS AND REDS OUT 
HE ONLY HAS THE BLUE AND BAULK 
COLOURS TO WORK WITH AT THE MOMENT 
LET'S SEE HOW HE GETS ON THE BLUE 
THIS TIME THIS MIGHT BE THE CHANCE 
TO GO INTO THE PINK AND REDS JUST 
MAKING SURE THERE IS NO PLANT ON 
THIS COULD FREE THE PINK AND A FEW 
REDS 
THERE IS NO NEED TO PLAY A CANNON 
HERE WITH A MILLION REDS IN OPEN 
PLAY BUT IF YOU WANTED TO PLAY 
CANNON THERE AT JUST TO BRING THE 
BLACK INTO PLAY BECAUSE BLACK AND 
PINK AT THE MOMENT A AWKWARD R. 
AWKWARD 
THAT COULD BE A GREAT SHOT LEAVE 
THE PINK IN THE MIDDLE THAT WOULD 
OPEN THE PINK FOR THREE OF THE TOP 
FOUR POCKETS 
THAT IS NOW I A FRAME WINNING 
CHANCE 
JUST SHOWS YOU HOW WELL CHANCE THESE YOUNG PLAYERS THINK THESE 
DAYS HE SPOTTED THAT A FEW SHOTS 
AGO 
IT USES AN INTERVIEW JAMIE COPE 
AND WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT FIVE TO ONE 
DEFEAT ENTIRE HE SAID HE WAS 
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING 
PETER HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE EVEN 
THOUGH IT IS HIS FIRST TIME HE WAS 
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT WHAT 
A START PETER EBDON HAS GOT A LOT 
TO THINK ABOUT SO EARLY ON IN THIS 
MATCH 
YOU CANNOT REALLY WIN A MATCH MATCH IN THE FIRST SESSION BUT YOU 
CAN CERTAINLY LOSE IT PETER EBDON 
WILL KNOW THAT HE HAS TO WIN AT 
LEAST THREE FRAMES OF THE SESSION 
STILL A CHANCE THAT HE COULD WIN AT 
THE REMAINING SIX BUT WHEN YOU'RE 
ARE THREE TO ZERO BEHIND YOU'RE ARE HAPPY TO 
GET OUT OF IT NO WORSE THAN FIVE TO FOUR 
ONCE AGAIN THAT CUE ACTION EVERY 
TIME I LOOK AT JAMIE COPE I THINK 
OF RAY REARDON HE HOLDS THE CUE 
ALMOST IDENTICALLY TO THE WAY THE 
GREAT RAY REARDON DID IT TOOK HIM 
TO SIX WORLD TITLES AND HIS FROM 
THE SAME PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT 
RAVE LIFTING FOR MANY YEARS STOKE 
THAT RAY REARDON LIVED IN 
PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SAY IT NOW HE 
IS TAKING RED INTO THE RIGHT 
CORNER THIS IS IF THE BUTT OF THE 
CUE IS CUPPED IN THE PALM OF HIS 
HAND THE BLACK IS IN PLAY NOW THIS COULD BE A BIG ONE 
A POSSIBLE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX AVAILABLE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE HIS 
HIGHEST MADE SO FAR BY NIGEL BOND 
THIS WILL MAKE THE FRAME IT SAFE 
AND HE WILL KNOW THAT HE CAN PLAY 
WILL LEAD THREE TO ZERO THEY HE CAN 
CONCENTRATE ON A BIG BREAK 
YEAR ON YEAR WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT 
CRUCIBLE NERVES WHEN A PLAYER CAN 
SIT FOR THE FIRST TIME COMES 
HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME LOOKED A 
BIT EDGY IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF 
FRAMES BUT LOOKS COMFORTABLE NOW 
A VERY GOOD CHANCE NOW OF MAKING 
HISTORY FIRST CENTURY BREAK AT THE 
CRUCIBLE THEATRE HIS VERY FIRST 
CENTURY BREAK 
IS THAT HEAVY CONTACT GOING TO 
SPOIL THE CENTURY BREAK THAT IS 
UNLUCKY BECAUSE HE HAS FINISHED IN 
NO MAN'S LAND 
VERY UCKY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
A CERTAIN CENTURY BUT MORE 
IMPORTANTLY OF TERRIFIC EIGHTY SIX BREAK 
WHAT A START FOR JAMIE COPE THE 
YOUNG PLAYER WHO IS AN AMAZING 
BREAK BUILDER THE ONLY PLAYER EVER 
TO HAVE MADE EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE 
OBVIOUSLY A 
FREE BALL NEEDED FIRST HE DID IT 
IN A PRACTICE GAME IN STOKE HE 
POTTED A RED GOT ON THE BLACK SO 
A SIXTEEN RED AND SIXTEEN BLACK AND WE ARE 
SEEING TODAY THAT HE IS A GREAT 
BREAK BUILDER A GREAT SINGLE BALL 
POTTER THE THING THAT WORRIES ME 
TODAY IS NOT THAT JAMIE IS PLAYING 
VERY WELL ON HIS DEBUT IT IS HOW 
APPREHENSIVE PETER EBDON LOOKS 
PETER HAS NOT SETTLED AT ALL 
SOMETIMES WHEN HE GOES BEHIND LIKE 
THIS HE PRODUCES HIS BEST SNOOKER 
BUT HE 
NOT LOOK HIS BEST AT 
THE MOMENT HE HAS TO START GETTING 
GOING SING 
THE THREE FRAMES WE 
HAVE SEEN PETER EBDON COULD HAVE 
WON TWO OF THEM IN FAIRNESS TO BE 
SITTING IN YOUR CHAIR THREE TO ZERO BEHIND 
WHEN YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE WON A 
COUPLE IS VERY FRUSTRATING BUT HE 
HAS A CHANCE TO PUT THINGS RIGHT 
HE IS COMING TO THE TABLE THE LAST 
SESSION BEFORE THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL 
NOT THE BEST BREAK OFF SHOT FROM 
PETER HE HAS BROUGHT RED UP 
JIMMY CAN GET THROUGH TO IT 
JAMIE 
WHAT SORT OF ANGLE HAS HE GOT ON 
THIS RED HE JUST PUT BIT OF 
QUICK WENT ON THERE HE MAY HAVE 
GOT AWAY WITH IT 
HE IS USUALLY PRETTY SMOOTH JAMIE 
JUST WATCH HIS CUE ACTION HE WAS 
ALL OVER THE PLACE THERE THAT IS A 
SIGN OF TENSION 
THE PRESSURE SOMEONE LIKE JAMIE 
COPE PUTS ON YOU YOU KNOW YOU HAVE 
GOT TO GET THE SAFETY SHOT RIGHT 
OTHERWISE HE CAN KNOCK THAT TYPE OF 
SHOT IN 
EVEN THOUGH HE DID NOT MEAN TO 
FLICK THE GREEN HE STILL GENERATED 
ENOUGH PACE IN THE CUE BALL SO THAT 
THE KISS DID NOT SMOKE THE WHITE 
DOWN L. DON'T THINK HE CAN AVOID 
THE KISS ON THE RED BELOW THE RED 
HE WANTS TO PLAY WHICH MEANS HE IS 
NOT BOUND TO GET ON TO A COLOUR 
IF HE IS ON THE BLACK THAT IS A 
FANTASTIC SHOT NOT ONLY DID HE 
HAVE TO POT THE RED AND GET THE 
HALF BALL KISS ON THE RED THAT WAS 
THE BEST SHOT HE PLAYED ALL DAY 
VERY WELL PLAYED THIS A CHANCE FOR 
HIM TO SETTLE 
BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED TO LEAVE HIMSELF 
ON THE BLACK THERE BUT THIS IS A 
BIT AWKWARD 
HE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS 
IT LOOKS LIKE HE CAN ONLY REALLY 
PLAY THE SCREW BACK 
HE HAS TRIED TO MAKE SOMETHING 
HAPPEN AND I ALWAYS THINK IT IS 
GOOD PLATE WHEN A PLAYER TRIES TO 
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN BECAUSE 
SOMETIMES YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN 
LUCK COULD PLAY 
HE WAS NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHERE 
THE KIDS WOULD COME BUT HE KNEW 
THAT WHATEVER KISS HE GOT HE WOULD 
BE ON TWIST OF REDS CHOICE OF 
REDS EBDON HAS NOT MADE A BREAK 
OVER THIRTY YET 
PETER IS HAVING TO CALL ON ALL HIS 
EXPERIENCE HERE SIXTEEN TIMES HE HAS 
PLAYED AT THE CRUCIBLE ON SIX 
OCCASIONS HE HAS GONE OUT AT THE 
FIRST ROUND HERE BUT HE KNOWS THE 
IMPORTANCE OF THIS FRAME BEFORE THE 
MID SESSION INTERVAL THE POT 
LOOKS TO BE ON THE PLANT 
ON REFLECTION OF THE OPENING FOUR 
FRAMES I THINK THREE TO ONE WOULD BE JUST 
ABOUT A FAIR RESULT JAMIE COPE HAS 
MISSED A COUPLE OF BALLS THAT 
PERHAPS YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO WIN A 
FRAME IF YOU MISS PETER EBDON UP 
UNTIL NOW HAS NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE 
OF JAMIE'S MISSES 
THIS IS ANOTHER KEY SHOT HE HAS 
GOT TO BE CAREFUL THAT THE RED DOES 
NOT COME IN LINE OF THE CUE BALL 
IF HE DOES GET ON TO THE BLACK IT 
SHOULD BE FRAME OVER L. THOUGHT HE 
COULD SEE THIS RED IN THE MIDDLE 
OBVIOUSLY NOT PETER EBDON WAS LIKE 
HIGHEST BREAK SO FAR IS NOT 
NECESSARILY GOING TO WIN HIM THE 
FRAME 
A LITTLE BIT OF NOISE COMING FRAME FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARENA 
THAT MATCH HAS REACHED THE 
RECESSION INTERVAL ALWAYS A 
LITTLE BIT OFF PUTTING 
MEANWHILE JAMIE HAS STOCKWELL UP 
FOR PETER EBDON STUCK ONE UP NOW 
A GREAT CHANCE TO GO ONE AND SECURE 
HIS FIRST FRAME 
THE FRAME IS NOW ALL THIS SLEAZE 
SAFELY IN THE BIKE AND I AM SURE 
PETER EBDON WILL BE BREATHING A 
SIGH OF RELIEF THIS FRAME IS NOW 
SAFELY IN THE BACK 
PETER STARTS TO 
PRODUCE HIS BEST SNOOKER WHEN THE 
HE IS UNDER PRESSURE 
A PIECE OF CAKE THIS GAME HE DID 
VERY WELL WITH THAT 
PETER EBDON GOES INTO THE INTERVAL 
WITH A LITTLE BIT ON HIS MIND I AM 
SURE JAMIE COPE LEADS BY THREE 
FRAMES TO ONE 
I AM SURE THAT IS A LITTLE BIT OF 
RELIEF FOR PETER EBDON THERE WHAT 
HAVE BEEN YOUR OBSERVATIONS ABOUT 
THE MATCH SO FAR AND IN PARTICULAR 
THE WAY PETER EBDON RESPONDED WE WE KNOW PETER EBDON WILL ALWAYS GIVE 
HIS BEST AND HE WILL TRY HIS HEART 
OUT FLIGHT OF THE END BUT IT HAS 
BEEN APPARENT IN THE FIRST SESSION 
THAT PETER EBDON IS NOT THE PLAYER 
IN FORM OF COURSE HE CAN PLAY HIS 
WAY TO FORM AND IT IS THE BEAUTY OF 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
IT IS 
INTERESTING BECAUSE HE DID NOT SEE 
JAMIE IN A MATCH THIS LENGTH HOW 
MUCH YOU THINK THERE'S A GOING TO 
PLAY A PART FOR THIS YOUNG MAN HE 
SEEMS FEARLESS 
I DON'T THINK IT 
COMES INTO THE EQUATION HE PLAYS 
IN A REFRESHING MANNER GOES UP 
SEES THE BALL AND IF IT IS POSSIBLE 
HE GOES FOR IT PETER HAS GOT 
HIMSELF ON THE BALL WILL GO AWAY 
AND HAVE CUP OF TEA REFLECT ON 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WILL SETTLE 
DOWN 
PETER IS ONE OF THE SENIOR DOWN MEMBERS OF THE TOUR NOW OBVIOUSLY 
YOU ARE AS WELL STEVE HE IS THIRTY SEVEN 
NOW I BELIEVE AND THERE WAS AN 
INTERESTING START THAT I HEARD 
ABOUT AND THAT WAS THAT NO ONE 
OVER THE AGE OF THIRTY ONE HAS WON THE 
WORLD TITLE SINCE JOE JOHNSON TWENTY TWO 
YEARS AGO STATISTIC 
THE GAME IS 
A HIGH PRESSURED AND THEY HAVE A 
CONTROLLING GAME AND IF YOU ARE NOT 
BE IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF YOUR BODY 
AND POSSIBLY A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD IS NOT 
IN CONTROL AS MUCH AS A TWENTY YEAR OLD 
BUT IT IS A GAME WHICH IS TOUGH ON 
AND IS IN THAT DEPARTMENT PERHAPS 
IT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY L. DO 
THINK THAT A PLAYER LIKE PETER 
EBDON WHO HAS KEPT HIMSELF IN 
DECENT NICK HE IS NOT OVER THE 
WHOLE THEY ARE GOING DOWN THE GYM 
NOT MUCH YOU PLAYING THIS WEEK NO NO TURNING UP 
THE PROOF WILL BE IN 
THE PUT IN GOOD LUCK WITH THAT ONE 
WHAT IS ALWAYS AMAZING THIS TIME OF 
YEAR FOR THE LIKES OF STEPHEN JOHN 
AND MYSELF AND RAY WHEN HE IS HERE 
ARE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SPEAK 
TO US IN THE STREET ABOUT CIRCA IT 
IS LIKE A FEVER THEY ARE NOT SO 
SECRET ADDICTION AT THIS TIME OF 
THE YEAR IT IS NOT JUST THE PEOPLE 
OF SHEFFIELD WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING 
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE ABOUT 
THEIR SECRET LOVE OF SNOOKER 
AS A GAME TO WATCH I THINK IT HAS 
GOT A PARTICULAR DRAMA TENSION AND 
EXCITEMENT AS THE GAME TO PLAY IT 
HAS AWKWARD MEMORIES FOR ME AM TERRIBLE 
A VERY RELAXED DISPOSITION DID I 
SAID NOT TOO LONG KNOWS VERY 
STEADY HANDS 
I LOVE WATCHING 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN PLAY RIGHT OR 
LEFT HANDED THE PRODIGIOUS TALENT 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AND 
WHAT GOES ON IN HIS HEAD EITHER 
YES THAT MAN WITH GLASSES DENNIS DENNIS TAYLOR 
IN SNOOKER IN A WAY YOU TAYLOR HAVE THE OPPOSITION BUT YOU'VE ALSO 
GOT THE BALLS AND THEY ARE YOUR 
OPPOSITION AS WELL YOU CANNOT 
CONTROL THEM ALL THE TIME YOU HOPE 
YOU'VE GOT IT RIGHT YOU TACTICS 
RIGHT BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN 
A BIG BREAK IS 
LIKE A GIRL WALKING PAST WITH A 
SHORT SKIRT YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK 
WHEREAS A TACTICAL BATTLE WOULD BE 
WHAT I MARRY HER 
NICE ONE L. HAVE 
TO SAY HAVE HAD SUCH A BIG GIRL 
DOING THOSE INTERVIEWS 
WILL 
TO SEE THEM THROUGHOUT THE 
WEEK DAYS HERE IN OUR AFTERNOON 
SESSIONS A REAL GIGGLE WASN'T IT 
JOHN 
DID YOU DO THIS DID THERE JOHN I DID THERE IS ONE A CRACKER COMING UP I I CANNOT REVEAL ANY MORE ABOUT IT IT 
IS A LONG THE LINES OF PHIL 
MICKELSON AT THE MASTERS LAST WEEK 
APPARENTLY I WAS SITTING ON HIM HE 
DID KNOW I'M A MARRIED DON'T YOU 
HE SAID BACK TO THE SNOOKER AND 
HAVE GONE TABLE ONE THIS AFTERNOON 
WE'VE GOT THE MASTERS COULD RUN UP 
PLAYING JOE SWAIL 
THESE TWO ARE BOTH MADE THE SEMI 
FINALS IN THE PAST L. BELIEVE JOE 
SWAIL HAS BROUGHT A BUSLOAD OF 
SUPPORTERS WITH HIM FROM BELFAST 
WE ARE GOING TO JOIN WITH JOE SWAIL 
HAVING WON TWO OR OF THE FIRST 
THREE FRAMES JOE SWAIL IS TRAILING 
BY ELEVEN POINTS 
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY I COULD SEE 
YOU COULD COME OFF THE LEFT AND SON 
OF THE TABLE BUT THE BLUE IS UNDER 
WAY MAYBE THE BLACK THAT IS ONE 
OF THESE THAT IF YOU PLAYED WITH 
PACE LIKE YOU'RE EXPECTED TO 
HIM TO THERE IS EVERY CHANCE HE 
WOULD LEAVE A FREE BALL THERE IS 
PLENTY OF ROOM AROUND THIS FREE RED 
IS HE GOING ONE CUSHION OR TWO 
CUSHIONS HE IS GOING OVER TO 
CUSHIONS WITH THAT THIS THIS RULE 
THE REFEREE IS GOING TO KEEP 
CALLING IT UNTIL HE HITS IT YOU YOU LIKE THE MISTRAL JOHN 
LOVE IT THEM THIS RULE HE MISSED THE RED 
JOHN 
IF YOU HAVE A LOOK HE DIDN'T JOHN HIT RIGHT ACROSS MY LIFE MILE 
LINE 
NO HE WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT OFF 
BUT HE SHOULD HIT IT THIS TIME 
FOUL AND AMIS 
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN SITUATIONS 
LIKE THIS THAT THE REFEREE GET HIS 
CUE BALL BACK WHERE IT WAS L. DON'T THINK IT WAS THE LAST TIME 
HE EXPECTED TO TO BE HIT THIS TIME 
WOULDN'T SHE THIS IS IT IS HE 
GOING TO LEAVE A FREE BALL 
OBVIOUSLY NO FREE BALL HOW COSTLY 
IS THIS IT HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED 
THE NATURE OF THE GAME HASN'T IT 
YES THIS IS WHAT WE DON'T LIKE 
ABOUT THE RULE IT PUT SAY PLAY IN 
A POSITION THIS IS HIS FOURTH ATTEMPT 
HE WAS TWENTY THREE POINTS BEHIND BEFORE THIS 
HE HAS HIT IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY 
NOW HE IS IN A SITUATION WHERE 
STEPHEN LEE JUST NEED THIS RED 
UNDERCOVER AND THERE WILL BE ALL 
SQUARE AT THE MIDSESSION INTERVAL 
STEPHEN LEE JUST NEEDS THIS RED 
AND A COLOUR 
THERE ARE TWO POINTS 
OF VIEW ABOUT THE RULE FROM 
STEPHEN THESE POINT OF VIEW HE 
PLAYED A VERY GOOD SHOT TO GET THE 
SNOOKER BUT FROM A JOE SWAIL IS 
POINT OF VIEW HE GOT SO CLOSE ON 
THE THREE TIMES IN MR. THERE ARE 
THREE TIMES HE MISSED IT A BUT IT 
HASN'T COST IN THE FRAME YET L. EXPECTED STEPHEN LEE TO MAKE THAT 
IT'S A TRICKY WIND THERE THIS 
ISN'T IT IT'S A TRICKY ONE 
THE PINK AND BLACK ARE PERFECTLY 
PLACED UNLUCKY HE JUST NEEDED TO 
CATCH IT A LITTLE BIT THINNER HE 
WOULD HAVE HAD THE BLUE IN THE 
BOTTOM RIGHT FOR AN EASY ONE IN THE 
CENTRE A TOUGH CALL THIS ONE YES YES BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE OF 
CLEARING OUT TO WIN A FRIEND YOU 
ARE ALWAYS TEMPTED TO DO IT OR 
AREN'T YOU TO PUSH THE BOAT OUT 
THE HE COULD TAKE THE BLUE IN THE 
LEFT CORNER BUT IT IS VERY CHANCY 
THAT 
A VERY GOOD SHOT I THINK IT IS THE 
RIGHT CHOICE TO TURN THE POT DOWN 
BY THINK HE HAS SNOOKERED STEPHEN 
LEE 
IT'S A BIG FRAME AT NOW THIS LEE ISN'T IT BOTH PLAYERS HAVE HAD 
CHANCES THEY PUT A LOT OF EFFORT 
INTO IT THEY ARE NOW COMING UP TO 
THE THIRTY SEVENTH MINUTE OF THIS FRAME BIG 
BIG FRAME 
NOT EASY TO PLAY A POSITIVE SAFETY 
SHOT THERE FROM STEPHEN LEE BUT HE 
DID THE RIGHT THING TO MAKE SURE 
THE BLUE WAS SAFE 
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STEPHEN 
TO PLAY THERE ARE SIMILAR SO SHOT 
TO PLAY THERE SIMILAR SHOT TO THE 
ONE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT CUSHION 
FIRST 
STEPHEN LEE I THINK WILL TAKE 
THAT 
HE IS HAVING A GO IT WAS A TOUGH 
SHOT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE 
PINK FOE SO I SUPPOSE YOU CANNOT 
CRITICISE HIM FOR TAKING IT ON 
BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY OF THE CUE 
BALL TO THIS TOP CUSHION THAT IS 
WHAT MADE IT DIFFICULT IF HE COULD 
HAVE GOT HIS UNDER THE TABLE WE 
WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN QUESTION TO 
GOING FOR IT NINE POINTS THE LEAD 
JUST THIS BLUE NEEDED FOUR STEPHEN 
STEPHEN LEE HAS TAKEN THAT FRAME 
AND THEY ARE ALL LEVEL AT THE 
MIDSESSION INTERVAL 
MEANWHILE WE WILL FAST FORWARD 
LIVE NOW AND THERE IS JAMIE COPE 
AND PETER EBDON THE YOUNGSTER IS A 
LEADING THREE TO ONE AS THEY COME BACK IN 
AND WE WILL HAND YOU BUT THEY ARE 
CAPABLE HANDS OF DENNIS AND WILLIE 
A VERY IMPORTANT FRAME THAT WAS 
BEFORE THE MIDSESSION INTERVAL 
FRAME FIVE JAMIE COPE TO BREAK 
DEAN REYNOLDS HAS PLAYED HERE IN A 
FEW OCCASIONS HE IS A GOOD LEFT 
HANDER FROM GRIMSBY L. WONDER IF HE IS HERE TO WATCH JAMIE COPE NICE TO SEE HIM HERE 
HE IS HAVING TO TAKE A MORE 
DIFFICULT BRIAN TO GET UP TO THE 
NEXT POSITION POSITIONAL SHOT 
BRIAN 
THE ONE AT THE BACK OF THE BUNCH 
TO THE RIGHT JUST PASSES INTO THE 
CORNER THERE IT IS WELL PLAYED 
IF HE TAKES THE BROWN HE MAY BE 
GOING INTO THE BUNCH FOUL 
DIDN'T QUITE GET THE SIDE ON THE 
WIDE HE WANTED TO SWING IT INTO 
THE BUNCH BUT HE HASN'T LEFT 
ANYTHING HE IS LOOKING MORE 
CONFIDENT WILLY ISN'T HE 
IT IS 
AMAZING WHAT THAT INTERVAL HAS DONE 
FOR HIM HIS DEMEANOUR HAS TOTALLY 
CHANGED 
THIS IS A DIFFICULT POT BUT THERE 
IS A GAP BETWEEN THE BLACK AND THE 
OTHER RED WHICH SHE WILL HAVE TO 
FIND HE FOUND THE GAP HE FOUND 
THE POT AND HE FOUND COLOUR 
WE KEEP SAYING WHEN YOU PLAY THE 
LONG MARCHES YOU SET YOUR STALL 
OUT AND PLAY THEM IN SETS OFF FOR 
YOU SAID YOU STALL OUT TO TRY AND 
WIN THEM THREE TO ONE YOU SET YOUR STALL 
ANYTHING ELSE IS A BONUS THAT HAS 
CERTAINLY OPENED THINGS UP HERE FOR 
JAMIE COPE AND HE HAS GIVEN HIMSELF 
A GOOD CHANCE 
HE HAS GOT ONE OF MIDDLE BUT IT HAS 
NOT WORKED OUT AS HE WOULD HAVE 
LIKED WHENEVER YOU ARE PLAYING A 
BALL INTO THE MIDDLE WITH LOTS OF 
LOOSE READ IT PUTS MORE PRESSURE 
ON THE POT AND LEAST REDS YOU 
CANNOT PERMIT YOU CANNOT TAKE 
LIBERTIES WITH THESE REDS 
THE CROWD CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGED 
THAT EXCELLENT POSITIONAL SHOT TO 
GET HIMSELF ON THE BLACK HE IS 
LOOKING VERY GOOD I MUST SAY HE 
SEEMS TO HAVE SETTLED 
HE WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED NOT TO 
GET TO WIN THE FRAME FROM THIS IS 
IT THIS VISIT 
A RED UNDER BLACKWOOD LEAVE PETER 
NEEDING SNOOKER NEEDING SNOOKER LOOKS LIKE FOUR TO ONE THE TO ME NOW 
JAMIE LOOKS LIKE HE COULD BE ON THE 
WAY HERE WE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE 
THIS FOR NOW BUT COVERAGE OF THIS 
MATCH AND THE OPENING DAY OF THAT 
CHAMPIONSHIP CONTINUES ON B. B. C. TWO 
IN A MATTER OF MOMENTS UNTIL THEN 
THE VARIOUS FOOTBALL TITLE RACE IS 
BOILING UP NICELY AND THE GOALS ON 
HEADLINES FROM THIS AFTERNOON'S 
MATCHES WILL FOLLOW SHORTLY COOL 
CO OVER ON B. B. C. TWO UNTIL THEN
