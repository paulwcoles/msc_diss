GOOD AFTERNOON FROM THE CRUCIBLE 
DAY BY DAY FRAME BY FRAME THIS 
WORLD SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIP IS 
MAKING PROGRESS THE BALL'S ARE 
CONTINUALLY BEING A RE RACKED FOUR 
OF THE FIRST ROUND MATCHES WENT TO 
A FINAL DECIDER THE WINNERS OF 
THOSE ARE ALL IN ACTION TONIGHT 
ALI CARTER PETER EBDON STEPHEN 
HENDRY AND DING JUNHUI 
IT IS AMAZING HOW MANY YOU DO GET 
IN THE FIRST ROUND THE MOST 
PROFESSIONALS WILL TELL YOU THE 
FIRST ROUND OF THE CRUCIBLE IS THE 
TOUGHEST ROUND 
WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO A DECIDING 
FRAME THERE IS NO WAY TO GO NO 
MARGIN FOR ERROR EVERYTHING IS 
RIDING ON IT AND THE STAKES ARE 
THE BIGGEST IN SNOOKER 
CARTER IS QUIETLY GOING THROUGH 
ANGUISH THE PLAYER IN FRONT CAN 
GET EXCESSIVELY ANXIOUS ABOUT 
POSSIBLY THROWING IT AWAY THE 
PLAYER BEHIND DIGS THAT EXTRA 
DEGREE DEEPER 
THAT IS WHAT THE CRUCIBLE DOES 
EVEN PLAYERS LIKE HENDRY HIGGINS 
THE GREATEST PLAYERS WE HAVE SEEN 
FEEL THE PRESSURE MORE HERE AT THE 
CRUCIBLE 
IF YOU CAN GET OVER THE CRUCIBLE LINE TEN TO NINE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW 
IT HAPPENS 
IF YOU COME THROUGH A TEN TO NINE YOU GO 
INTO THE NEXT ROUND FEELING TWO 
THINGS ONE YOU CAN COPE WITH 
ANYTHING AND TWO THAT IS BONUS 
THAT MAY BE THE CASE WITH STEPHEN 
HENDRY 
DING JUNHUI IS GO TO TAKE A LOT OUT 
OF THAT MATCH HE HAS PROVED TO 
HIMSELF THAT HE CAN PLAY HERE UNDER 
PRESSURE IT IS THE FIRST TIME HE 
HAS GOT TO THE SECOND ROUND HERE 
EBDON TENSE TO PRODUCE HIS VERY 
BEST WHEN HE IS BEHIND RATHER THAN 
WHEN HE'S IN FRONT IN THE DECIDING 
FRAME WE SAW THE VALUE OF 
EXPERIENCE 
A I DID FEEL A BIT EXPERIENCE SORRY FOR BARRY HAWKINS THE OTHER 
DAY AGAINST ALI CARTER HE WAS THE 
MAN ON THE CREST OF A WAVE BUT 
THEN PLAY WAS SUSPENDED FOR TWO 
AND A HALF HOURS 
A PLAYER'S STEEL IS STRENGTHENED IN 
THE HEAT OF THE CRUCIBLE IF YOU 
SURVIVE A VERY CLOSE MATCH IT 
GIVES YOU SUCH LIFT YOU HAVE 
BEEN THROUGH THE BUYER AND SURVIVED 
THE FIRE 
YOU CANNOT BEAT THE 
DECIDING FRAME 
I KNEW YOU WOULD 
TURN THE CONVERSATION ROUND TO THAT 
FINAL DECIDERS YOU HAVE TO BE 
OPTIMISTIC YOU HAVE TO BE QUITE 
AGGRESSIVE USE YOUR ADRENALIN 
THAT CAN WORK TO YOUR ADVANTAGE 
DON'T BE TOO DOWNHEARTED IF YOUR 
OPPONENT GET OFF TO A GOOD START 
WE HAVE OFTEN SEEN A PLAYER 
SNATCHED DEFEAT FROM THE JAWS OF 
VICTORY THE LAST FRAME CAN BE 
BIZARRE HOW DID YOU APPROACH TO 
THE LAST FRAME 
I ALWAYS GO BACK TO 
THE GREAT JOE DAVIS WON IT IN THE 
NINETEEN SEVENTIES I SPENT FIFTEEN MINUTES ASKED 
HIM FOR SOUGHT ADVICE HE SAID 
PLAY THE PERCENTAGES HE SAID PLAY 
THAT THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER USE 
THE PERCENTAGES BUT AS YOU KNOW 
YOU JUST WANT TO GET A CHANCE IN 
THE LAST FRAME YOU DON'T WANT TO 
GO THROUGH FOUR ANYTHING SILLY JUST JUST ONE CHANCE IS IT ALL YOU NEED 
HEARTED I MISSED THAT BLACK 
PRESSURE THAT IS THE WORD YOU'RE 
LOOKING FOR 
AND NO ONE HAS ONE 
MORE FINAL PRINT SUCH AS THAT JOHN 
PARROTT OFF WE GO THIS IS THE 
STATE OF PLAY FIRST 
TO THIRTEEN GOES THROUGH TO THE LAST EIGHT ONE FORMER WORLD CHAMPION IS GOING TO THE QUARTER FINALS ANOTHER IS GETTING KNOCKED OUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE CHAMPION SHAUN MURPHY PLAYS 
ALI CARTER MARK KING IS HOPING TO 
REACH HIS FIRST WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
QUARTER FINAL AT EXPENSE OF 
ANOTHER FORMER CHAMPION THE EVENTUAL SECOND ROUND THE 
WINNERS WILL FORM THE QUARTER FINAL 
LINE UP 
WE'RE GOING TO START WITH WHAT IS 
STEPHEN HENDRY'S SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY EIGHTH MATCH 
HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE 
BY COMPARISON BUT CHINA'S DING 
JUNHUI IT IS ONLY HIS THIRD MATCH 
INSIDE SNOOKER'S MOST FAMOUS ARENA 
TODAY I WILL BE DOING THE SECOND 
SESSION OF THE PETER EBDON VERSUS 
MARK KING MATCH PETER LEADS OF FIVE TO THREE 
IT WILL BE VERY TIGHT IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT CONCLUSION 
OF THIS NEXT ONE IS 
I'M LOOKING 
FORWARD TO COMMENTATING ON THE 
MATCH BETWEEN HIGGINS' AND DAY 
HIGGINS IS THE DEFENDING CHAMPION 
RYAN DAY IS A REAL UP AND COMING 
PLAYER NINTH IN THE WORLD ALSO ALSO SHAUN MURPHY'S SECOND ROUND MATCH 
WITH ALI CARTER BREAKS OFF ACTION 
TO FOLLOW IN A FEW HOURS' TIME IN 
THE RUN UP TO THE TOURNAMENTS 
SHAUN MURPHY WAS GIVING OUT 
COACHING TIPS TO COMMUTERS WITH 
JOHN 
AND WE WILL HEAR FROM A FORMER 
CHAUFFEUR DEEP SHEFFIELD 
WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL SNOOKER FAN 
MARK BRIGHT 
I WAS NEVER ANY GOOD 
AT IT IT WAS FOR BALL FOR ME BUT 
WE USED TO GO DOWN TO WILLIE 
THORNE'S SNOOKER CENTRE ALL THE 
TIME A PACKED AFTERNOON OF 
TIME FEATURES A DISCUSSION ON THE WAY 
FIRST UP STEPHEN HENDRY VERSUS 
DING JUNHUI 
AND HIS OPPONENT WINNER OF AN 
OUTRAGEOUS THIRTY SIX RANKING EVENT TITLES 
FIVE TIME A U. K. CHAMPION SEVEN TIMES A 
WINNER HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE THE 
PRIDE OF SCOTLAND STEPHEN HENDRY 
IN THE FIRST FRAME THERE IS NO 
SCORE 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A 
LOT WORSE GOING IN OFF NOT THE 
END OF THE WORLD HE HAS LEFT A 
LONGISH RED FOR STEVEN BUT NOTHING 
EASY 
SLIGHTLY HIT THE WRONG SIDE OF IT 
BUT THE IN OFF WASN'T BAD 
NEEDS TO MISS THE GREEN IF IT DOES 
THIS IS THE FIRST CHANCE HENDRY 
UNDOUBTEDLY THE GAME'S GREATEST 
EVER BREAK BUILDER 
HE CAN STOP THINKING OF A SIZEABLE 
BREAK START 
I THINK TO BE FAIR HENDRY HAS TO 
LEAD IN THIS MATCH TO GIVE HIMSELF 
A BIT MORE CONFIDENCE AND ALSO PUT 
DING JUNHUI UNDER PRESSURE IF DING 
JUNHUI DOES IN FRONT IT WILL BE 
TOUGHER FOR STEPHEN 
HE WILL BE ON THE BLACK AFTER THIS 
AND THE PINK WILL BE IN PLAY 
A NICE LITTLE SHOT GIVEN THE 
SPREAD OF THESE REDS THE COUPLE A 
ROUND UP BLACK ARE A LITTLE BIT OF 
INCONVENIENCE HE WOULD LIKE TO GET 
THOSE CAUGHT OUT OF THE WAY 
NOT A DEFINITE A FRAME WINNER JUST 
YET BUT THOSE TWO REDS ARE THE 
ONLY STUMBLING BLOCK 
BUT THESE ARE AS PERFECT AS YOU 
COULD HAVE THEM THAT IS THE FIRST 
MISTAKE THAT IS VERY POOR SHOT 
DEPENDS WHAT KIND OF ANGLE HE HAS 
GOT ON THIS RED WE HAVE SEEN THIS 
WEEK IF THEY CATCH THE NEAR JAW 
THESE ARE NOT EASY 
I THINK WHAT HAPPENED WAS HE DID 
NOT POTTED CLEANLY THIS BLACK 
HE DID NOT POT IT CLEANLY 
HE IS TAKING A SLIGHTLY MORE 
DIFFICULT POT WHICH GIVES HIM MORE 
POCKET TO A MAD GOOD RECOVERY 
WAR POCKET TO AIM AT 
A SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT POT BUT 
MORE POCKET TO AIM AT BACK IN 
PRIME POSITION 
SO EARLY IN THE MATCH BUT STEPHEN 
HENDRY LOOKS UP FOR THIS TASK L. AM 
SURE HE TOOK A LOT OF CONFIDENCE 
OUT OF HIS WIN AGAINST MARK ALLEN 
HE WAS REALLY TESTED IN THAT MATCH 
AT TIMES IT SEEMED ALMOST 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO WIN THE WAY 
THE MATCH HAD DEVELOPED 
THE OTHER THING ABOUT STEPHEN 
HENDRY HE'S AT THE STAGE OF THE 
CAREER WHICH STEVE HAPE STEVE 
DAVIS GOT TO HE IS WINNING ALL THE 
TIM PEOPLE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE TO 
BEAT HIM 
YOU JUST GET THE FEELING PEOPLE 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM START WINNING 
AGAIN IT IS THE WAY IT IS 
YOU CAN NEVER TAKE AWAY THE FACT 
THAT HE IS JUST AN AMAZING SNOOKER 
PLAYER 
IT HAS TO BE SAID IF HE HAD BEEN 
INCLINED TO PLAY BIT MORE SAFETY 
HE WOULD STILL BE A WINNER BUT IT 
TENDS TO TRY AND PLAY EXACTLY THE 
SAME GAME AS HE DID WHEN HE WAS 
WERE ALL THOSE TITLES L. MENTIONED 
EARLIER ON IT CATCHES UP WITH YOU 
SOMETIMES YOU CANNOT KEEP KNOCKING 
THEM IN 
BUT IN THE BALLS HE IS STILL UP 
THERE WITH THE BEST 
HE DOESN'T 
MIND MAKING A CENTURY DOES HE SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN 
HE HAS MADE IN PROFESSIONAL 
TOURNAMENT PLAY OBVIOUSLY HE HAS 
MADE THOUSANDS ON THE PRACTICE 
TABLES WHO IS TO SAY THEY WILL BE 
ANOTHER ONE HERE 
HE HAS GOT THE NATURAL ANGLE TO 
PLAY THE ONE ALONG THE CUSHION BUT 
I DOUBT HE IS GOING TO ENTERTAIN 
THAT 
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY PLAYED 
IT WAS A CUEING SHOT COULD HAVE 
GONE WRONG 
THIS WILL BE FRAME BALL THIS WILL BE THE RED I THINK THAT 
DETERMINES WHETHER HE MAKES A 
CENTURY 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER DING JUNHUI 
HAS A DIFFERENT WAY OF BUT 
MEDITATING HE VERY RARELY WATCHES 
HIS OPPONENT PLAYED HIS OPPONENT 
PLAYED HE MIGHT BE HAVING A NAP 
YOU NEVER KNOW 
IT WILL NOT DO HIM ANY HARM 
WATCHING SOMEONE LIKE STEPHEN 
HENDRY I KNOW HE IS ONE OF THE 
BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD DING 
JUNHUI BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS LEARN 
WATCHING GENIUS PLAY HE HAS NOT 
NOT WATCHED ONE SHOT IN THE LAST 
FORTY POINTS 
IT IS HIS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEENTH A CENTURY IN HIS 
CAREER A TERRIFIC START TO THE 
MATCH 
NOT EVEN A RAISED THE MATCH EYEBROWS FROM DING JUNHUI L. AGREE 
WITH YOU TO WATCH AN OPPONENT PLAY 
IT IS THE FIRST FRAME YOU WANT TO 
KNOW HOW THE CUSHIONS ARE HOW FAST 
IT IS COMING OFF THE CUSHION HE HE CANNOT EXACTLY CONGRATULATE STEPHEN 
ON THE BREAK HE HAS NOT SEEN ANY 
OF IT 
WHAT A START TO THE MATCH FROM 
STEPHEN HENDRY HE MEANS BUSINESS 
THE THINKING IS THAT HE COULD NOT 
GET PAST THE HIGHEST BREAK TEN THOUSAND 
PRIZE FOR THE HIGHEST BREAK THE NEXT TWO OF FRAMES WERE SHARED 
OBVIOUSLY DING JUNHUI HAS TO PLAY 
THE BLACK ANY OTHER COLOUR AND 
THE BLACK IS COVERING THE POCKET 
HE IS ON A RED SO IT IS NOT ALL 
BAD 
HE LOOKS SO CAREFREE TODAY BAD DING JUNHUI 
I JUST CANNOT PUT MY FINGER ON HIS 
DEMEANOUR TODAY AT THE MOMENT THE 
GOOD RESULT THAT THOUGH HE WILL 
BE DISAPPOINTED NOW IF HE DOES NOT 
WIN THE FRAME 
I JUST WONDER MAYBE WITH DING 
JUNHUI MAYBE BE ASKED A LOT OF HIM 
HE IS TWENTY ONE JUST BABY IN THE GAME H. E. HAS BEEN AROUND FOR SIX YEARS HE PLAYED AS WILD CARD AT FOURTEEN 
BUT IT IS NOT EASY PLAYING A SPORT 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD 
MOST OF THE TIME AND HE HAS GOT 
HIS BEST YEARS AHEAD OF HIM AS SNOOKER PLAYER 
THE ODD BIT OF TEMPERAMENT IT IS 
JUST HIS AGE I SUPPOSE THAT WILL 
TEST HIS TEMPERAMENT L. CANNOT 
BELIEVE YOU MISSED THAT HE 
MISSED THAT 
IN THE LAST TEN OR SO YEARS I HAVE 
BEEN COMMENTATING QUITE REGULARLY 
YOU CAN SEE DIFFERENT THINGS IN 
DIFFERENT PLAYERS WENT YOU KNOW 
THEY ARE NOT RIGHT L. DON'T THINK 
HE IS RIGHT TODAY THIS IS A BIG 
CHANCE FOR STEPHEN HENDRY YOU 
CANNOT WIN THE MATCH IN THE FIRST 
SESSION BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY LOSE 
IT 
THIS FRAME LOOKS AS THOUGH IT MAY 
HAVE GONE STILL A BIT OF WORK TO 
DO HERE FOR STEPHEN HENDRY JUST 
DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT TODAY 
THAT HAS GONE A BIT HIGH A LITTLE 
RUEFUL SMILE ON STEPHEN HENDRY'S 
FACE HE KNOWS THAT THIS IS NOW 
QUITE A TRICKY ONE IT IS MORE 
DIFFICULT THAN THE BLACK HE JUST 
MISSED IN THE SAME POCKET BY A 
WIDE MARGIN 
THAT IS A GOOD SHOT AND HE HAS GOT 
AN ANGLE ON THIS 
THIS WILL BE A BODY BLOW TO DOING 
DING JUNHUI 
HIS MANAGEMENT TEAM WHAT TOLD HIM 
THAT HE'S NOT PLAYING GREAT BUT 
THINGS CAN CHANGE STEPHEN HENDRY 
IS NOT PLAYING GREAT EITHER JUST 
STAY IN THE MATCH THE HIGHEST 
BREAK TWENTY SIX SO FAR 
STEPHEN JUST PULLING OUT OF THAT 
SHOT AT THE LAST SECOND THE BROWN 
WILL LEAVE EIGHTEEN POINTS THE DIFFERENCE 
HE CHANGED HIS WAY OF PLAYING THAT 
I THINK HE KNOWS THE SCORES HE 
WILL BE PLAYING ON THE PINK WITH 
ANY GREAT IMPORTANCE THIS IS FRAME 
BALL SNOOKER'S I. NEEDED NOW 
DING JUNHUI CONCEDES STEPHEN 
HENDRY WINS THE FRAME 
AS USUAL WE ARE IN THE CUE ZONE A 
LOT OF PEOPLE GATHERED TO PLAY 
SNOOKER GOOD AFTERNOON WHAT DO 
YOU FEEL ABOUT DING JUNHUI'S 
TEMPERAMENT 
I THINK THE JURY IS TEMPERAMENT STILL OUT ON IT IN A MATCH 
SITUATION UNLIKE RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN'S TEMPERAMENT NOBODY IS 
QUESTIONING HIS TEMPERAMENT HAVING 
THE BIG OCCASION AS YET HE HAS 
NOT PROVED HIMSELF FULLY AT THE 
CRUCIBLE ALTHOUGH IT WAS A GOOD 
WIN OVER MARCO FU THIS LOOKING 
DOWN IT IS AN INTERESTING THING 
NECESSARILY WRONG BUT THE ADVICE 
TO YOU IT WAS 
JOHN SPENCER ALWAYS 
HAD TO LOOK AT THE OPPONENT BUT HE 
SAID THE OPPOSITE TO ME HE SAID 
NOT TO LOOK AT THE TABLE NOT TO 
LOOK AT YOUR OPPONENT LET THE 
WORLD GO BY WE DO THAT IS YOUR 
CHANCE SO THERE IS TWO VIEWS ON 
THAT HE LOOKS STRANGELY SUBDUED 
HE IS TWENTY ONE BUT HE HAS PLAYED SOME 
FANTASTIC SNOOKER THIS YEAR 
CERTAINLY GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN AT THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
IT IS 
INTERESTING I AM NOT MEDICALLY A 
F. A. OF THE SITUATION BUT WE CAN SEE 
WHEN WE GET CLOSE UP BUT HIS RIGHT 
EYE TWITCHES INVOLUNTARILY L. 
DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT IS ALL THE 
TIME OR ONLY IF HE GETS UNDER 
PRESSURE IF YOU HAVE GOT IT AT 
WHICH IN YOUR EYE AS YOU WILL KNOW 
IF IT HAPPENS TO YOU IT CAN AFFECT 
YOUR EYESIGHT IF YOU'RE A SHOT AND 
THAT HAPPENS THAT WOULD BE VERY 
UNNERVING IF HE GETS IT SOMETIMES 
AND NOT OTHERS THAT MAY BE 
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT 
BACK TO 
THE ACTION 
IT IS A TOUCHING BALL I'M NOT SURE 
IF THAT IS ANY USE TO HIM 
OH THAT IS A SHOCKER THAT'S AN 
AWFUL SHOT 
HE IS JUST NOT CONCENTRATING AT THE 
MOMENT 
THIS IS MINI CRISIS FOR DING STILL SOME WORK TO DO THIS IS NOT BARRED BECAUSE IT 
DEPENDS WHETHER PINK GOES BAD 
THIS WILL BE ANOTHER DIFFICULT SHOT 
IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THOSE FRAMES 
WHERE EVERYTHING HAS GONE DIFFICULT 
FOR BOTH PLAYERS 
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT I THOUGHT HE 
WAS GOING TO STAY ON THE BAULK LINE 
WHICH WAS GOING TO BE A TOUGH SHUT 
TOUGH SHOT ON THE GREEN GREEN OR 
BROWN AS LONG AS HE MISSES THE 
CASE ON THE BLUE THAT THE ONLY 
THING THAT CAN GO WRONG HERE THE 
KISS 
HAS HE MISSED THE BLUE I REST MY 
CASE 
HE HAS DONE THIS HIT THAT BY THE 
PROVERBIAL MILE NEITHER PLAYER IS 
AT THE RACES AT THE MOMENT 
IT HAS 
BEEN A HORRIBLE FRAME OF SNOOKER 
IT HAS NOT ALL BEEN BAD PLAY THE 
BALLS HAVE JUST RUN HORRIBLY FOR 
BOTH OF THESE TWO 
ANOTHER HALF A CHANCE FOR DING 
JUNHUI THAT'S BETTER 
A VERY VERY NICE SHOT TO SCREW UP 
FOR YELLOW OR BROWN EVEN THIS IS 
NOT PERFECT THE NATURAL SHOT 
YELLOW TO COME UP FOR THE RED NEAR 
THE BLACK BUT HE IS GOING TO PLAY 
THE DEEP SCREW THAT IS NOWHERE 
NEAR WHAT A STRANGE GAME 
IN THE END I THINK THAT WAS A 
LITTLE UNLUCKY HE DID DECIDED TO 
TAKE THE RISK AND I THOUGHT IT WAS 
IN WHEN HE HIT IT 
PURPOSELY NOT PLAYING TO BRING THE 
BLUE IN TO PLAY BECAUSE HE DOES NOT 
NEED IT 
WELL HENDRY WILL BE ABSOLUTELY 
AMAZED AND DELIGHTED THAT HE HAS 
BECOME A FIVE TO ONE IN FRONT AFTER HAVING 
HAD THREE OR CHANT THREE OR FOUR 
CHANCES IN THE FRAME HE COULD RUN 
AWAY WITH THIS MATCH 
HENDRY NOT DOING IT BUT DANGER AND 
WE CERTAINLY NOT DOING IT HE HAS 
NOT MADE ANY SIZABLE BREAKS AT ALL 
HENDRY LEADS THE MATCH BY FIVE ONE 
DAMAGE LIMITATION REQUIRED IN FRAME 
THE FINAL FRAME OF THE 
OPENING SESSION 
THAT WAS A MILE AWAY IT HAS BEEN 
AN ENTERTAINING SESSION OF SNOOKER 
BUT NOT ALL OF IT HAS BEEN GOOD 
THAT WAS NOT CLOSE AT ALL 
IDEALLY HE WOULD LIKE TO GET THE 
BROWN OF THE NEXT RED HE HAD A 
QUICK GLANCE TO SEE IF THE PINK 
WOULD POT THE TWO REDS ABOVE THE 
BLACK ONCE HE GETS IN TO ONE OF 
THOSE WE WILL SEE WHAT HE HAS GOT 
IN THE TANK THIS IS THE KEY SHOT 
HE HAS PLAYED THAT GREAT JUST 
WONDERING WHETHER HE CAN PLAY INTO 
THE BUNCH TO LOOSEN A FEW THINGS UP 
THE BROWN AND THE MINUTE IS IN THE 
WAY AT THE MINUTE 
HE DESERVED A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD 
FORTUNE 
GOOD SHOT WELL DONE 
YEAH THAT 
WAS ANOTHER GOOD SHOT IT IS LATE 
IN THE DAY BUT IF HE CAN SOMEHOW 
WIN THIS FRAME FOR SIX TO TWO HE COULD 
REGROUP AND HE WOULDN'T BE OUT OF 
THE MATCH 
THAT WAS ANOTHER GOOD SHOT ALL OF 
A SUDDEN HE LOOKS LIKE HE IS IN 
THE FLOW HE IS REMARKABLE PLAYER 
IN THAT HE CAN GO FROM ONE TO THE 
OTHER SO QUICKLY 
HE IS A LITTLE BIT IN TROUBLE THERE HE IS ASKING FOR THE CUE BALL TO BE 
CLEANED AT LEAST HE IS TAKING BIT OF A BREATHER 
IT HELPS HERE THAT THE PINK GOES ON 
TO THE BLUE SPOT IT GIVES HIM 
LOT MORE ROOM THIS IS BY FAR AND 
AWAY THE HIGHEST BREAK OF THE MATCH 
FOR HIM SO FAR 
THE FRAME IS JUST ABOUT SECURED HE 
WOULD PROBABLY LIKE TO CARRY ON NOW 
WOULD PROBABLY LIKE TO CARRY ON NOW ACTUALLY HE LOOKS LIKE HE HAS GOT 
A BIT OF RHYTHM IN HIS GAME HE 
THRIVES ON GETTING A RIBBON IN HIS 
GAME HE IS UNSTOPPABLE WHEN IT IS 
WHEN HE IS AT HIS BEST 
I'M GLAD THIS PACKED AUDIENCE HAS 
SEEN DING PLAY LIVE OTHERWISE 
WHAT THEY WOULD SAY WHAT IS THE 
FUSS ABOUT HE CAME OUT HERE TODAY 
LIKE HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT DAY IT 
WAS THIS CENTURY I DON'T THINK 
UNLESS HE KNOCKS A COUPLE OF 
MIRACLE ONES IN AT LEAST HE HAS 
PROVEN HE IS NOT GOING TO LIE DOWN 
AND THAT WAS KEY 
STEPHEN HENDRY WILL BE PLEASED WITH 
THAT SESSION NEITHER PLAYER WERE 
AT THEIR BEST DING JUNHUI TRAILS 
BY SIX TO TWO TO THE SEVEN TIMES WORLD 
CHAMPION 
WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT STEVE 
FANTASTIC SESSION FOR STEPHEN 
HENDRY WHEN THE BOOKMAKERS DAY 
MADE DING JUNHUI TWO TO ONE ON FAVOURITE 
WHEN COULD YOU GET STEPHEN HENDRY 
AT TWO TO ONE IN THE MATCH AT THE 
CRUCIBLE NORMALLY STEPHEN HENDRY 
WOULD BE IN HIS NORMAL PHASE NOT 
UP TO SCRATCH BUT WILL HAVE A 
SUDDEN HE LOOKED OUT HE'S HE'S FORGOTTEN ALL YOUR STUFF COME UP AS 
HE HE'S FORGOTTEN WHAT HE WANTED 
BUT GOT THIS ONE THOUGH IT DID YOU 
GET MY SANDWICHES WELL 
I WANT IS 
SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AS AS TO DING HE LOOKS STRANGELY SUBDUED 
TO ME FOR HIM TO PLAY SEVEN FRAMES 
OF SNOOKER AND TO MAKE HIS HIGHEST 
BREAK OF TWENTY SIX HE WOULD NEVER BELIEVE 
THAT WAS RIGHT STEPHEN IS DOING 
WHAT HE HAS GOT TO DO HE HAS NOT 
BEEN AT HIS BEST TODAY BUT HE WILL 
BE DELIGHTED WITH SIXTY TWO 
THE OTHER DAY 
YOU FELT STEPHEN WAS JUST ONE 
RESULT AWAY FROM RETURNING TO 
SOMETHING LIKE HIS BEST JUST JUST BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU AN ADDED BOOST 
OF CONFIDENCE HE HAS NOT BEEN AT 
HIS BEST TODAY BUT HE WILL BE 
DELIGHTED FOR A SIX TO TWO 
STEVENS SAID 
THE OTHER DAY HE IS DETERMINED HE 
HAS GREAT DETERMINATION 
I FEEL 
THE CHINESE PRESS ASKING WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED TO DING THAT IS SNOOKER 
IN THREE SESSIONS IT COULD EASILY 
BE DING DO IT IS STEPHEN IN THE 
NEXT SESSION 
LET'S DO SOMETHING 
ELSE NOW SO THE GUYS CAN HAVE 
SOMETHING TO EAT AND THE SANDWICHES 
LET'S TURN OUR ATTENTION TO A 
PLAYER WHO ALREADY HAS COUNTLESS 
MEMORIES OF HIS LIFE IS BURKA 
PLENTY MORE TO COME NO DOUBT FROM 
PETER EBDON 
I WAS BORN AT THE ROYAL FREE 
HOSPITAL IN ISLINGTON IN LONDON L. 
WENT TO HIGHBURY GROVE SCHOOL L. 
DID LATIN AND ANCIENT GREEK AND 
THAT SORT OF STUFF IT DID NOT 
INTEREST ME TO BE HONEST HAD 
TRIALS FOR LONDON SCHOOLBOYS AS A 
LEG SPINNER I ENJOYED PLAYING 
CRICKET I SWAM FOR LONDON LIFE 
SAVING TEAM WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED 
IN SERVING AS SOON AS I STARTED 
PLAYING SNOOKER AND YOU ARE WANTED 
TO DO THAT L. BURNT 
MY BRIDGES AS MY DAD SAID A FRIEND OF MY FATHERS 
TOOK ME TO THE LOCAL SNOOKER CLUB 
JUST BEFORE I TURNED FOURTEEN HAD ONE 
OR TWO FRIENDS AT THE TIME WHO WERE 
VERY GOOD SNOOKER PLAYERS THEY HAD 
ABILITY WE STARTED PLAYING IN 
JUNIOR TOURNAMENTS TOGETHER WE 
BECAME JUNIOR MEMBERS AT KING'S 
CROSS SNOOKER CLUB THERE WERE SOME 
FANTASTIC AMATEURS AND THEIR SOME 
OF THEM WENT ON TO DO WELL AS 
PROFESSIONALS I DON'T THINK I WAS 
PARTICULARLY GOOD WHEN I FIRST 
STARTED I MIGHT HAVE MADE A SIXTY 
BREAK WITHIN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS 
I THINK I MADE MY FIRST MAXIMUM AT 
FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN BEFORE I KNEW IT I WAS 
REPRESENTING ENGLAND ON A JUNIOR 
LEVEL AND THEN SENIOR LEVEL ONE OF 
THE WORLD UNDER TWENTY BY ONE OF THE 
WORLD AND TWENTY ONE CHAMPIONSHIP IN 
AUSTRALIA IN NINETEEN NINETY TURNED PRO THE 
FOLLOWING YEAR WANT EIGHT OR TEN 
MATCHES TO QUALIFY FOR THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP I LOST TO TERRY 
GRIFFITHS IN THE QUARTER FINALS 
PLAYED WELL AGAINST HIM HAD A FEW 
CENTURIES HAD STEVE DAVIS THE 
FIRST ROUND HE WAS MY IDOL FOR THE 
YEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN PLAYING 
SNOOKER I CAME IN QUITE ATTACKING 
QUITE FAST FAST FAST CERTAINLY 
NOT AS SLOW AS I HAVE BECOME 
THROUGH EXPERIENCE REMEMBER 
PLAYING JOHN PARROTT ONE DAY AND 
PLAYING VERY WELL AGAINST HIM IN MY 
EARLY CAREER A FIGURE WALKED OFF 
THE TABLE HAVING MADE JUST FROM 
MEMORY SOMETHING LIKE AND EIGHTY A 
COUPLE OF SIXTIES A COUPLE OF FIFTIES AND 
ABOUT THREE OF FOUR FORTIES L. GOT BEAT 
FIVE TO ONE EVERY TIME I MADE A FIFTY OR SIXTY 
I WENT FOR THAT ONE BALL TOO MANY 
AND JOHN PARROTT CLEARED UP IN 
THAT ONE MATCH MORE THAN ANY OTHER 
I CAN REMEMBER I THOUGHT I CANNOT 
KEEP DOING THIS THAT IS ABOUT 
FINDING THE BALANCE RISK AND 
REWARD I'VE ALWAYS DESPERATELY 
WANTED TO BE WORLD CHAMPION AS 
YOU GET LITTLE BIT OLDER I THINK 
YOUR PRIORITIES CAN CHANGE HAVE 
ALWAYS BEEN A FAMILY MAN MY DESIRE 
TO SUCCEED IS STILL AS STRONG AS 
EVER I SEE MYSELF ACHIEVING THINGS 
IN THE GAME THAT IF I WERE NOT 
ABLE TO SEE I WOULD PUT MY CUE 
AWAY TODAY WHAT YOU PUT IN IS WHAT 
YOU GET OUT IF YOU WANT IT BAD 
ENOUGH YOU'VE GOT TO BE PREPARED 
TO PAY THE PRICE IN ADVANCE 
OTHERWISE YOU WILL NOT ACHIEVE 
WHAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE 
THE TWO THOUSAND TWO WORLD CHAMPION PETER IS 
UP AGAINST ESSEX BASED MARK KING 
IN THE SECOND ROUND MARK HAS NEVER 
GOT FURTHER THAN THIS STAGE OF THE 
TOURNAMENT FIVE TO THREE TO PETER WAS THE 
OVERNIGHT SCORE IT IS MARK TO PLAY 
THANKS TO A BREAK IN FRAME NINE 
COMMENTARY BY TERRY GRIFFITHS AND 
JOHN VIRGO 
AND PETER NOW GOT A 
CHANCE TO BRIDGE THE GAP 
HE HAS 
NOT POTTED A BALL YET HE'S HAD A 
FEW HALF CHANCES EXPECT HIM TO POT 
ONE HERE AND SCORE A FEW 
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO 
CALL THE SHOTS WITH PETER EBDON IN 
THE COMMENTARY BOX 
HE IS SOMEONE 
YOU REGARD AS A STEADY TYPE OF 
PLAYER HE PLAYS SOME VERY 
AGGRESSIVE SHOTS SOMETIMES L. 
REMEMBER ONE YEAR WHEN HE PLAYED 
JIMMY WHITE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP AND 
JIMMY HAD HIM IN ALL KINDS OF 
TROUBLE HE POTTED A GREEN WHICH I 
DON'T THINK ANYONE I HAVE EVER SEEN 
PLAYING THIS GAME WE HAVE GONE FOR 
LN IT WENT CLIPPED THE END RED OF 
THE CUSHION AND FINISHED UP BEATING 
JIMMY 
HE LOOKS INCH PERFECT TO ME ON 
THIS RED 
HE WILL NOT PLAY FOR THE PINK NOW 
THE BLUE IS A NATURAL TO BLOW TO 
DROP ON TO THE YELLOW A BIG FRAME 
THIS IT IS A BIG MOMENT IN THAT 
MATCH TERRY I AGREE I. N. D. THE 
MATCH 
IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE HE GOT PAST 
THE BAULK LINE HE HAS OVERDONE 
THAT HE CAN'T REACH THIS SO HE HAS 
TO USE THE REST IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT SHOT NOW 
I THINK THE PROBLEM HERE IS PINK TO 
BLACK 
IT IS THE ONE JOHN CALLED I DON'T 
THINK OF PETER EBDON COULD HAVE 
PLAYED THE BETTER PLAYED IT 
BETTER 
JUST RUN A BIT TOO FAR HE STILL 
HAS THE CHANCE OF A POT BUT IT IS 
AT SAINT ONE FOR A BIG BIG FRAME 
IT IS THERE ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC 
FORM PETER EBDON HE CLEARS UP WITH 
A BREAK OF SEVENTY THREE WHAT MUST MARK KING 
BE THINKING HE LOOKED HOME AND DRY 
PETER EBDON NOW LEADS BY SIX FRAMES 
TO THREE 
IN THE NEXT FRAME PETER HAS THE 
HEFTY LEAD FIFTY POINTS UP 
THAT WAS FRAME BALL HE WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE MISSED IT SO 
MARK KING YOU HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE 
THREE REDS THREE BLACKS ALL THE 
COLOURS TO WIN BY ONE POINT 
MARK KING HAS TO CONTEND WITH THE 
RED ON THE SIDE CUSHION BEING 
LEFT HANDED HE WOULD HAVE DO 
PLAYED WITH THE REST PLAY IT 
WITH THE REST 
HE JUST BOUNCED OFF THE CUSHION 
QUICKER THAN IT WENT ON 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE DEAD STRAIGHT 
THAT IS O. K. 
HE JUST HAS A SLIGHT 
ANGLE HERE DO YOU MAKE THE RED 
MORE DIFFICULT TO BY PACE NO 
HE PLAYED IT WELL THIS BLACK AND 
THE SIX REMAINING COLOURS TO PUT TO 
RIGHTS THE FRAME HE SHOULD HAVE WON 
THE FIRST ONE THIS MORNING HE 
SHOULD HAVE LOST THIS POOR SHOT 
ANYTHING BUT KISSING THE PINK 
TREMENDOUS RECOVERY SHOT THERE HE 
WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE 
POSITION HE PLAYED FOR THE YELLOW 
PETER EBDON MISSED A BIG CHANCE IN 
THIS FRAME HE HAD THREE 
COMFORTABLE REDS TO CLINCH IT MARK 
KING SHOULD HAVE WON THE FIRST 
FRAME THIS MORNING HE LOST IT 
THAT HAS WENT TOO FAR BUT YOU 
COULDN'T REALLY SAY HE MISSED AS 
MANY COULD CHANCES AS PETER EBDON 
HAS MISSED IN THIS FRAME THIS WILL 
HURT PETER IF MARK CAN POT THIS 
BLUE PINK AND BLACK THE POT ON 
THE BLUE ISN'T DIFFICULT IT IS 
JUST JUDGING THE PACE OF THE CUE 
BALL ROUND THE TWO CUSHIONS FOR THE 
PINK 
MIDDLE OR BOTTOM POCKET POSITION 
IS MUCH EASIER IN THE LEFT CORNER 
BUT THE POT IS MORE DIFFICULT 
BIG DECISION BIG SHOT IN A BIG 
FRAME 
WELL JUST POT A BIT OF STUN ON 
THAT WHEN HE NEEDED MORE PLAIN BALL 
IT HAS TAKEN THERE RUN OUT OF THE 
CUE BALL TAKING A FOUGHT OUT THE 
PACE A FAULT FOOT 
THE POT WAS TOO THIN A GREAT 
CHANCE TO PINCH THIS FRAME PINCH 
IS THE OPERATIVE WORD HE HAS 
FAILED AT THE LAST 
HURDLE WILL 
HE 
GET A BETTER CHANCE 
I COULD GUESS WHAT HE PLAYED BUT IT 
WOULD BE I GUESS IT WAS SO BAD I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT HE PLAYED 
I THINK 
HE PLAYED POT STRANGE AS IT MAY 
SEEM HE SHOULD HAVE WON THIS FRAME 
THIS IS A BONUS FRAME FOR MARK KING 
YOU COULD SAY THE REVERSE ABOUT THE 
OPENING FRAME 
THE FRAME TOOK OVER FORTY MINUTES 
MARK KING NOW TRAILS SIX FRAMES TO 
FOUR 
HE HAS GOT THE SNOOKER AGAIN ONCE 
AGAIN NOT A DIFFICULT SNOOKER BUT 
HIS TIS THE OLD PROBLEM 
CAN HE 
HIT 
IT AND GET IT SAFE TWENTY SEVEN POINTS 
BEHIND PETER EBDON ONLY NEEDS THIS 
RED AND ONE COLOUR THIS IS THE 
LAST FRAME BEFORE THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL 
FOUL AND A MISS INTERVAL WHO PUT THE BLUE THERE SAID MARK 
KING THINK HE WAS THERE WHEN HE 
HIT THE CUE BALL HE COULD HAVE 
COME DOWN THE TABLE AND BEEN 
CERTAIN TO HIT THE RED HE HAS 
GIFTED THIS FRAME 
THE PROBLEM WAS 
HE WAS CUEING OVER THE YELLOW SO 
DIFFICULT TO JUDGE ANGLES AND PACE 
WHEN YOU PLAY OVER THE TOP OF OTHER 
BALL ANOTHER BALL THAT BLUE HAS COST HIM THE FRAME 
ANOTHER SHOT HE GOT WRONG 
I AM 
MAKING A NOTE OF HOW MANY WE DID 
WRONG AND RIGHT WITH PETER'S SHOT 
SELECTION 
IT IS LIKE YOUR BANK SELECTION STATEMENT JOHN A BIT HEAVY ON ONE 
SIDE 
BARRING SNOOKERS PETER EBDON WILL 
GO EIGHT TO FOUR IN FRONT 
THERE WAS A CHANCE THERE IT IS 
UNUSUAL FOR A PLAYER TO PLAY ON 
WHEN HE REQUIRES FOUR SNOOKERS YOU 
NEVER KNOW 
HE PLAYED WITH TOP SPIN AND SIDE TO 
GET BEHIND THE BLACK IT WAS VERY 
AMBITIOUS 
THAT IS ENOUGH MARK HAS CONCEDED 
ANOTHER LONG FRAME FORTY ONE MINUTES 
GOES TO PETER EBDON 
THE NEXT TWO FRAMES WERE SHARED AT 
NINE TO FIVE TO PETER WE MOVE TO FRAME FIFTEEN 
HE IS FIFTY POINTS BEHIND 
JOHN YOU SAID THIS IS A HARD 
CHANCE FOR HIS OPPONENT AND IT IS 
BUT HE HAD A COULD CANNON TO PLAY 
OFF THE BLACK 
HE ALMOST GOT THREE OF THEM INTO 
PLAY HE HAS TWO INTO PLAY OF THE 
DIFFICULT FOR ME 
THIS IS A TRICKY 
SHOT USING THE REST WITH A THIN 
CONTACT THE CUE BALL COULD BE 
RUNNING FREE 
THAT IS PRETTY GOOD NOT THE 
PERFECT ANGLE ON THE BLUE BUT HE 
WOULD SETTLE FOR THAT THIRTY FIVE POINTS 
BEHIND HE DOESN'T HAVE TO PLAY THE 
BLUE 
HE COULD PLAY THE GREEN HE IS MAPPING OUT WHAT HE SEES AS A 
CLEARANCE HERE NOW HE PLAYED THAT 
WELL HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH ANGLE HE 
CAN'T REALLY GET THIS RED BACK ON 
THE LEFT HAND CUSHION INTO PLAY THE 
NORMAL WAY WHICH IS OFF THE BOTTOM 
CUSHION AND KISS IT OUT BECAUSE 
THE PINK IS IN THE WAY SO WILL HE 
PLAY FOR THE GREEN OR IF HE IS 
STRAIGHT ON THE BLUE HE SHOULD 
PLAY THAT 
HE HAS POINTS TO SPARE 
HE IS THIRTY BEHIND 
I SUPPOSE PASS STRAIGHT GREEN IT 
IS A BONUS IF HE CAN CANNON THE RED 
SO TWENTY SIX POINTS IN THE FRAME THIRTY FIVE LEFT 
ON THE TABLE PETER IS RIGHT BACK 
IN IT IF HE MISSED 
THE CANNON ON 
IT WAS NEVER DONE TO BE POTTABLE L. 
THOUGHT HE PLAYED FOR THE YELLOW 
HE PLAYED IT SHORT OF PACE AND LEFT 
HIMSELF STRAIGHT GREEN 
MARK KING HAS DONE I FIFTY FIVE IN THIS 
FRAME HE WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED TO 
LOSE IT THAT IS A GOOD SAFETY 
ALWAYS DO THE OBJECT BALL SAFE 
FIRST 
VERY FORTUNATE HE PLAYED THAT RED 
ON TO THE LEFT TOP CUSHION AND MISS 
IT IS TOTALLY MISHIT IT TOTALLY 
THAT HAS BROUGHT THE BROWN INTO 
PLAY OFF THE CUSHION IT WAS PRETTY 
TIGHT AGAIN THAT HIS ADVANTAGE TO 
PETER EBDON THERE MARK KING DIDN'T 
WANT TO BRING THE BROWN OUT 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I CAN'T 
BELIEVE HE HAS PLAYED THAT AGREED 
SHOT AND THE KISS ON THE BROWN 
YES SOMETIMES IT IS HARD TO WORK 
OUT WHAT PETER IS GOING TO PLAY 
THERE IS NOTHING MARK CAN DO NOW 
THE DIFFICULTY THERE WAS THE PACE 
TO GET ON THE YELLOW BUT HE PLAYED 
IT PERFECTLY WE HAVE A NEW 
FAVOURITE FOR THIS FRAME THIS 
ISN'T THE FIRST FRAME THIS MORNING 
THAT MARK KING HAS HAD CHANCES TO 
WIN AND LOST NAIL BITING TIMES 
IT WILL BE THE LAST FRAME OF THIS 
SESSION WE ARE PLAYING ONE SHORT 
BECAUSE THE NEXT MATCH IS AT TWO THIRTY P. M. 
HE HAD A KICK THERE AMAZING WELL 
YOU CAN'T DO THING ABOUT THAT AT 
SUCH CRUCIAL TIME IT HAS ALMOST 
TOTALLY STOPPED PETER EBDON IN HIS 
TRACKS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN TEN TO FIVE IN 
FRONT WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT THESE 
KICKS 
IT IS JUST THAT FULLY KICKS UNLUCKY DREADFULLY UNLUCKY A 
FEW MOMENTS AGO MARK KING WAS 
SLUMPED IN HIS CHAIR JUST THE BROWN WAS NEEDED 
IT WILL BE A RELIEVED MARK KING 
BOTH PLAYERS HAVE MADE MISTAKES IF 
ONE PLAYER COULD FIND HIS GAME 
THAT COULD BE THE MAN WHO WINS THIS 
MATCH BOTH PLAYERS WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED THEY SHAKE HANDS 
MARK KING WILL BE RELIEVED IT 
LOOKED AS THOUGH HE WAS GOING TO FORTY FIVE 
BEHIND BUT HE WILL BE HAPPY TO BE 
ONLY THREE BEHIND AT THE END OF 
THIS SESSION 
THOSE SEVEN FRAMES TOOK TWO AND 
THREE QUARTER HOURS 
MARK BE 
THREE QUARTER HOURS MARK WILL BE RELIEVED BUT ALSO AN UPHILL 
STRUGGLE FOR HIM AGAINST A PLAYER 
LIKE PETER EBDON WHO DOESN'T GIVE 
YOU THINGS VERY EASILY FRAMES 
IT WILL STILL BE AN UPHILL BATTLE 
BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE HE HE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO BE NINE TO SIX BECAUSE 
THAT KICK ON THE GREEN WAS GOING TO 
MAKE IT TEN TO FIVE IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
GET PETER EBDON BACK IT IS 
ADDITIONAL SNOOKER TOUGH TO PLAY 
IN ATTRITIONAL BUT HE HAS TO DO 
IT 
MARK KING HAS SO MUCH IT ENTHUSIASM HE CLEARLY LOVES BEEN 
HERE AND WANTS TO DO WELL BEING 
HERE YOU FEEL BIDDER EBDON KNOWS 
HIS WAY AROUND THE CRUCIBLE 
HE IS 
ONE OF THE BEST DISJOINTED SNOOKER 
PLAYERS HE CAN PLAY SCRAPPY STUFF 
BUT MARK KING KNOWS FOR THE SCRAP 
AS WELL SOME PLAYERS LOSE THEIR 
FLOW COMPLETELY AGAINST PETER EBDON 
MARK WON'T DO THAT BUT IT WOULD BE 
NICE FOR HIM TO WIN THE FIRST FRAME 
AND BE NINE TO SEVEN 
THIS EVENING THE FIRST 
FRAME COULD SET THE AGENDA 
AND IF 
HE WON A COUPLE OF GAMES IN ONE 
VISIT MARK BUT PETER IS STRONG 
FAVOURITE 
ALSO HER BE TO WIN FAVOURITE THROUGH IS DEFENDING CHAMPION JOHN 
HIGGINS BUT HE HAS TO BEAT THE 
WELSHMAN RYAN DAY 
WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY 
MAKES THIS IS STILL A PLACE WE GET 
A BUZZ HERE 
THIS ARENA IS VERY INTENSE IT IS 
DEFINITELY BEST VENUE L. HAVE A 
TOUGH MATCH AGAINST JOHN HIGGINS 
HE IS HE 
MATTHEW IN THE FIRST MATCH L. WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
JOHN AND RYAN RELAXED AGAIN END 
OF THE OPENING SESSION JOHN GOT 
THE PERFECT START A BREAK OF NINETY SIX IN 
THE OPENING FRAME WHEN MY AND 
MISSED THIS SIMPLE BLACK JOHN 
CLEARED UP TO LEAD TWO TO ZERO RYAN 
JOHN ALSO ONE FRAME THREE AND THAT 
TREMENDOUS SHOT SET THE STAGE FOR A 
BREAK OF SEVENTY NINE AND A FOUR TO ZERO LEAD RYAN 
GOT ON THE SCOREBOARD IN FRAME FIVE 
WITH SIXTY ONE ONE BECAME TWO WHEN JOHN 
WENT IN OFF IN FRAME SIX HE 
CAME FIGHTING BACK IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TWO 
TO JOHN HIGGINS IN THE FINAL FRAME 
BUT THE WELSH MAN STOOD TALL AND 
JOHN WILL TAKE A FIVE TO THREE LEAD INTO THE 
SECOND SESSION 
JOHN ONE FRAME NINE NOW LET'S GO 
LIVE AND GOOD AFTERNOON TO NEAL 
FOULDS AND CLIVE EVERTON 
GOOD AFTERNOON NO 
SIGNIFICANT SCORING YET IN THIS 
FRAME A GOOD LONG RED FROM RYAN 
DAY 
NOT TEMPTED TO ATTEMPT THE YELLOW 
THERE WAS THE AVAILABILITY FOR A 
NASTY SNOOKER 
IT WAS VERY WELL 
JUDGED HE IS SO TIGHT BEHIND THE 
GREEN JOHN WAS CUEING DOWN TO GET 
IN THE REDS HE HAS LEFT THE RED HE 
WAS STRIKING 
THE ONE TO THE CENTRE MIGHT 
INTEREST HIM 
A BIT HAMPERED FOR THE BLACK BY 
THE RED 
THE REFEREE COMES FROM WATER 
MORTAR 
HE MANAGED TO GET THE NECESSARY 
SPIN ON THE BALL 
BUT PLAYERS MADE MISTAKES IN THE 
FIRST FRAME THIS AFTERNOON BOTH 
PLAYERS PERHAPS EXCESSIVELY 
ANXIOUS TO MAKE GOOD START 
CERTAINLY RYAN DAY COULD NOT AFFORD 
A BAD START LIKE YESTERDAY WHEN 
JOHN MACRO JOHN RATTLED OFF FOUR 
FRAMES BEFORE HE EVEN GOT GOING 
RYAN DAY'S POT SUCCESS RATE IS A 
VERY LOW HALFWAY THROUGH IT 
YESTERDAY EVENING IT WAS IN THE 
LOW SEVENTIES 
THAT IS O. K. HE IS ON THE RED ALL 
RIGHT 
THAT IS A GOOD SHOT AS WELL HE'S A 
VERY GOOD PLAYER WHEN HE GETS GOING 
HE GETS A LOT OF WORK ON THE BALL 
FOR LITTLE EFFORT REALLY THAT IS 
THE SIGN OF A CLASSY PLAYER 
HE STANDS SEVENTH IN THE 
PROVISIONAL WORLD RANKINGS 
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FINISHED 
STRAIGHTER ON OR RED TO RIGHT 
MIDDLE 
GOOD RECOVERY BUT STILL NOT IN 
PRIME POSITION AND THE REMAINING 
REDS FAR FROM IDEALLY SITUATED 
CUEING DOWN ON THE CUE BALL THERE 
WAS TO REASON WHY HE MISSED THAT 
HE WILL NOT MIND WHERE THE CUE BALL 
FINISHED 
A SMILE OF RELIEF FROM DAY HE WAS 
EXPECTING TO LEAVE HIGGINS' A RED 
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS HE HAS LEFT 
RYAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET HIS 
HAND AT THE TABLE 
LONG POTTING IS NORMALLY HIS 
STRENGTHS BUT NOT THAT TIME 
THIS IS JUST A QUESTION OF WHERE 
THE CUE BALL WILL GO HE HAS 
CONTROLLED IT WELL HE IS PERFECT 
ON THE BLACK JUST A QUESTION NOW 
OF WHAT ELSE DOES WHAT ELSE DOES 
HE PLAYED THE LITTLE CANNON THAT 
HAVE STARTED TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN 
NOW HE MAY PLAY A LITTLE CANNON 
HERE ON THE RED ABOVE AND HOLD FOR 
THE YELLOW 
I JUST FEEL THAT WHAT HE WILL DO 
WHEN THE BALLS ARE REPLACED IS 
FOR THE RED ABOVE THE WHEN HE IS 
PLAYING 
IF HE CAN GET ANYWHERE IN BEHIND 
THEM THEN HE'S GOING TO HAVE SOME 
KIND OF SHOT HE COULD PLAY ON THE 
ONE ALONG THE CUSHION 
THAT LOOKS OFF STRAIGHT AS WELL 
WHICH IS GOOD 
YOU GET THE FEELING THE FRAME IS 
GOING TO REVOLVE AROUND THE RED 
DOWN THE TABLE 
HE'S A LITTLE BIT OF STRAIGHT AGAIN 
OFF STRAIGHT AGAIN HE WOULDN'T 
WANT TO COME TO THE RIGHT OF THE 
BLACK TO GET ON THIS BUT YOU MIGHT 
HAVE TO 
IF HE COMES TO THE RIGHT 
OF THE BLACK THE RED ON THE 
CUSHION HAS GOT FURTHER TO TRAVEL 
TO THE RED OTHER CORNER 
BUT HE JUST CRAWLED THE CUE BALL 
PAST THE BLACK TO LEAVE IT TO THE 
NEARER CORNER 
BEAUTIFUL SHOT THAT HE'S A LITTLE 
DISTRACTED SOMEONE WAS LOOKING AT 
THE PROGRAMME IN THE FRONT ROW 
THERE 
IT IS STARTING TO LOOK OMINOUS FOR 
DAY 
HE WANTED TO BE STRAIGHT AND HE IS 
NOT SO AND TWO CHOICES LOT OF 
RIGHT HAND SIDE WHICH IS NEVER 
FIND ON THESE CLOTHS OR ALL AROUND 
THE TABLE L. THINK IT IS GOING TO BE THE LATTER 
HE HAS AVOIDED ALL THE HIGH COLOURS 
BUT HE IS A LONG WAY AWAY THIS 
MEANS IF HE POTS THIS GREEN WHICH 
IS TRICKY HE WILL WIN THE FRAME 
HIGGINS DISAPPOINTED NOT TO CLEAR 
UP BUT RELIEVED THAT THE GREEN HAS 
NOT FINISHED IN A POTTABLE POSITION 
HE HOPED TO GET IN BEHIND THE BROWN 
MORE WORRY IS THE GREEN CAN DON'T 
GET TO IT L. RECKON HE CAN CAN 
JOHN GET TO IT HE HAS BEEN GIVEN A 
SECOND CHANCE VERY QUICKLY THERE 
IS A LONG WAY FROM CUE BALL TO 
GREEN BUT I THINK WHEN WILL BE 
CONCERNED I THINK RYAN DAY WILL 
BE CONCERNED 
JUST A BIT TOO THICK MUCH TO DAY'S 
RELIEF MAXIMUM DISTANCE INVOLVED 
AND THAT CORNER TO CORNER ALMOST 
THIRTEEN FEET 
THEY COULD WELL BE A REPRIEVE FOR 
RYAN DAY THERE COULD WELL BE 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF WORK STILL 
LEFT TO DO IT WASN'T THE BEST OF 
SHOTS AS IT HAPPENS BUT HE MIGHT 
BE O. K. AND ONLY THE PINK NEEDED AT THE END DAY REDUCES HIS ARREARS 
THE GREATEST PERFORMANCE IN MY 
CAREER WOULD HAVE TO BEAT MY FIRST 
EVER WORLD TITLE THAT WOULD 
PROBABLY HAVE TO GO DOWN AS MY 
GREATEST PERFORMANCE BEATING KEN 
IN THE FINAL HE WAS THE DEFENDING 
CHAMPION I THINK YOU REALISE HOW 
HARD IT CAN BE TO WIN AT THE WORLD 
TITLE WHEN HE FIRST WON IT YOU 
THINK THAT WAS BUT HARD AS PART 
BUT THE HARD PART IS TRYING TO 
EMULATE IT IT TOOK ME KNOWING 
YEARS TO DO THAT IT TOOK ME NINE 
YEARS I HAVE BEEN PRACTISING SINCE 
I WAS NINE I'M THIRTY TWO NIL THIRTY TWO NOW 
WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE THE ELATION OF 
WINNING A TOURNAMENT IT GETS YOU 
OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING 
I HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF HIGH POINTS 
IN MY CAREER SO FAR THE BEST WAS 
REACHING THE FINAL OF THE MALTA CUP 
LAST SEASON FEEL LIKE I'M 
CAPABLE OF GOING ON AND WINNING 
TOURNAMENT THERE NOW MY 
STRENGTHS ARE LONG POTTING AND 
BREAK BUILDING IN THE LAST FEW 
SEASONS I HAD TO WORK ON THE 
SAFETY ASPECT OF THE GAME WHEN I'M 
PRACTISING I PLAY AGAINST PLAYERS 
MORE THAN THAT SOL PRACTICE IT 
FIRED NOT GOT AGAIN LINED UP I 
TEND TO WORK ON SAFETY NOT GOT A 
GAME LIKE THAT AT THE END OF THE 
DAY IT IS ALL ABOUT WINNING YOU 
MAY HAVE TO TAKE A WINNING EVEN IF 
YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED WELL 
JOHN HIGGINS RESUMED A FIVE TO THREE UP THIS 
AFTERNOON AND HE IS STILL TWO UP 
HAS HE LEFT A POSSIBLE RED TO FOUR 
CORNER TOO FAR CORNER IT HAD A LONG WAY TO TRAVEL 
HE LEFT THAT ONE TO MIDDLE HE CAN NUDGE A FEW REDS IN THE PACK 
IF HE WANTS TO DON'T THINK HE 
WILL GO INTO THEM ALL THAT FIRMLY 
JUST DEVELOP ONE OR TWO PUSH A FEW 
INTO PLAY LOOSEN THE PACK 
JOHN HIGGINS CAME TO THE CRUCIBLE 
BUT HAVING REACHED A SINGLE SEMI 
FINAL THIS SEASON NOT HAVING 
BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE GOT HIMSELF 
RIGHT 
I DON'T THINK MANY PEOPLE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT JOHN IN THE BUILD UP 
NOT BECAUSE HE IS NOT A GREAT 
PLAYER BUT BECAUSE DEFENDING 
CHAMPIONS HAVE NOT COME BACK AND 
WON AGAIN OR TWELVE YEARS AGO IT LAST 
HAPPENED THAT WAS A SLIGHTLY DODGY 
CONTACT THE BLACK LEFT THE BED OF 
THE TABLE THERE 
NOBODY OVER THE AGE OF THIRTY ONE HAS WON 
THE WORLD TITLE SINCE JOY JOHNSON 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX JOE JOHNSON 
A LOT OF PLAYERS ALL TURNED PRO 
AROUND THAT TIME PROBABLY THE BEST 
OF BATCH OF NEWCOMERS EVER RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN MORE WILLIAMS HIGGINS 
HIGGINS IS THIRTY THREE NEXT MONTH HE 
APPEARS TO HAVE OVERRAN HIS 
INTENDED POSITION 
YOU DO NOT SEE 
HIM DO THAT VERY OFTEN GIVE THE 
TABLE A BASH IT IS NOT SOMETHING 
JOHN DOES HE WAS ENRAGED BY THAT 
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN IT 
JOHN HIGGINS PUNCHED THE TABLE 
BEFORE NO 
MICHAEL HOLT A PRODUCE POOR PLAYER 
BUT NOT THE QUALIFIER ADDED THAT 
ONCE IN A QUALIFYING POSITION AND 
ENDED UP IN DERBY GENERAL HOSPITAL 
HE GOT A BROKEN FINGER 
I THINK HE 
MISSED THE NEXT TOURNAMENT OVER IT 
AS WELL 
BUT IF YOU PUNCHED A SNOOKER TABLE 
THERE IS ONLY ONE WINNER I ALWAYS 
THINK 
HE'S LOOKING AT THAT RED THAT IS 
POTTABLE AND HE'S LOOKING IF HE 
CAN HEAD THROUGH THE GAP HEAD TO 
THE BAULK AREA HE GOT THE GAP 
UNFORTUNATELY THE POT DID NOT GO 
IN 
HE HAS NOT LEFT AN EASY RED ON 
THOUGH 
I THINK HE JUST PLAYED THE CUE BALL 
THERE L. THINK HE'S O. K. L. DON'T 
BELIEVE THAT WILL CUT ALTHOUGH 
JOHN IS HAVING A LITTLE LOOK 
COULD BE A STALEMATE ALTHOUGH JOHN 
HIGGINS LEADS BY FORTY THREE POINTS SO HE 
PROBABLY WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN 
DAY TOOK A BIT OF A CHANCE TRYING 
TO GET THE RED AWAY BUT HE HAS 
LEFT THE RED ON TO RIGHT MIDDLE 
HE PLAYED IT DEAD WEIGHT TRIED TO 
HOLD HOLD UP OF THE BLUE 
HOLDER OF THE BLUE 
PERFECT IF HE IS DEAD STRAIGHT 
ANYWAY 
IN REACHING SEVENTH PLACE IN THE 
PROVISIONAL RANKINGS HE HAS 
REACHED TWO WORLD RANKINGS FINALS 
BUT NOBODY REALLY MAKES THEIR NAME 
UNTIL THEY HAVE MADE AN IMPACT AT 
THE CRUCIBLE 
HE HAD A GOOD CHANCE TO SEW IT IN 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR TO DO SO HE MISSED A PINK 
THAT WAS EFFECTIVELY MATCH BALL 
AND LOST TEN TO NINETY TWO JOHN HIGGINS 
THAT TWO THOUSAND SIX HE LED RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
NINE TO SEVEN GOING INTO THE FINAL SESSION 
OF THEIR SECOND ROUND MATCH HE 
ALSO LED TEN TO NINE BUT LOST THIRTEEN TO TEN 
SO HE STILL AWAITING HIS FIRST 
REALLY BIG WING AT THE CRUCIBLE 
HE IS STILL AWAITING 
PLAYED A GOOD SHOT THERE HE IS 
PERFECT ON THIS 
NO OTHER REDS HAVE SPLIT WELL HE 
IS DEFINITELY ON ONE ABOVE THE PINK 
HE HAD THE PERFECT ANGLE TO GO INTO 
THEM 
THIS IS A BIT TOO CLOSE TO THE REDS 
NOT THE GREATEST OF SHORTS THAT 
SHOT 
I DO BELIEVE THAT AT LEAST TWO RED 
WILL POT INTO THE RIGHT CORNER SO 
IF HE CAN GET TO THE LEFT OF THE 
TABLE DUE GET THE FEELING HE IS O. K. 
TWO OF THOSE GO MAYBE EVEN THREE 
OF THEM 
THIS WILL BE A VERY IMPORTANT 
CLEARANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 
MATCH 
IN A FRAME THAT HE LOOKED LIKE HE 
MIGHT LOSE AT ONE POINT JUST 
CHECKING OUT HIS ANGLE THERE ON THE 
BLACK AT WORST HE COULD PLAY 
THEIR RED TO THE LEFT CENTRE BUT 
HE WILL NOT REALLY WANT THAT 
HE HAS HAD TO PLAY SECOND BEST SHOT 
REALLY 
I THINK HE IS POSSIBLY THINKING 
ABOUT RUNNING THROUGH ONTO THE PINK 
THAT IS PRETTY STRAIGHT THIS TIME 
HE HAS TO GO IN AND OUT OF BAULK 
THAT IS A BEAUTY THAT IS A REALLY 
GOOD SHOT 
IF HE MAKES SURE OF THE BRAN 
HIGGINS WILL NEED A SNOOKER THE 
BROWN 
SO DAY HAS ONE OR TWO OF THE FIRST 
THREE FRAMES THIS AFTERNOON HAS WON A PRETTY GOOD EFFORT FROM FOUR TO ZERO DOWN 
STEVE WE WERE TALKING DURING THAT 
FRAME AND YOU COULD MAKE AN 
ARGUMENT FOR EVERY FRAME BEING 
VITAL IN TERMS OF ITS SWINGING THE 
VITAL IN TERMS OF ITS SWINGING THE SCORE SUDDENLY HE WON A FRAME AND 
YOU FEEL AS IF YOU ARE BACK IN THE 
GAME 
EFFECTIVELY EVERY FRAME IS GAME IT TO US EIGHTY TWO FRAME SWING THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF RYAN DAY BEING ABLE 
TO CLEAR UP WHEN GIVEN A CHANCE IS 
ALL THE SUDDEN STARTING TO EAT AWAY 
AT JOHN HIGGINS JOHN HIGGINS 
STARTED OFF SOME KEYS WITH LAST 
NIGHT AND ALL THE SUDDEN RYAN DAY 
WITHOUT PLAYING ANYTHING TOO WELL 
GOT BACK IN THE MATCH JOHN IS NOW 
A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATED AS IS SO 
WITHOUT BAN ON A TABLE CAN YOU 
EVER A MAN HAD AN DO THAT 
I CAN 
ONLY REMEMBER ONCE OF THAT 
HAPPENING THIS IS A SERIOUS THUMB 
LISTEN THAT HE IS NOT VERY HAPPY 
THERE HE GOT A BIG BOUNCE OF THE 
TOP CUSHION HE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT 
THESE NEXT FEW FRIENDS ARE HE WAS 
TRYING TO PRESS AHEAD THERE MAKE A 
GOOD BREAK TO GET THAT BACK OPEN 
AGAIN AND RYAN HAS MADE A FABULOUS 
BREAK YES EIGHTY TWO IT WAS 
HE HAS GOT A HALF CHANCIER HE IS 
ANOTHER ONE WHO ONCE HE HAS GOT 
INTO HIS STRIDE IS EXTREMELY 
DANGEROUS 
I WONDER IF HE WAS DANGEROUS HEARTENED AT ALL BY THE FACT JOHN 
BANGED THE TABLE IN THE LAST GAME 
IT MAY HAVE GIVEN HIM A BOOST HERE 
IS THE LAST SHOT NICELY STRUCK 
TWO THINGS ABOUT THAT YOU SEE A 
PLAYER WHO BANGS THE TABLE FOR US 
BY AS THE TABLE FIRST THING IT 
HURTS AND THE SECOND IT GIVES THE 
OTHER GUY A CLUE AS TO HOW YOU ARE 
FEELING 
HE GOT IN CLOSE TO THE BLUE THERE 
AND WITH THE ANGLE HE HAS HE 
CERTAINLY COULD GO INTO THE RED 
THE REDS 
THEY BIT OF A DODGY ONE HAVING TO 
ROLL IT FROM VERY NEAR THE SIDE 
RAIL L. THINK IT WAS ALSO FAIR TO 
SAY THAT RYAN DAY IS LESS HAPPY 
WITH THE ROLLING THE BALL AND SOME 
PLAYERS ARE OF THAN SOME PLAYERS 
ARE HIS FELLOW WELSHMAN MARK 
WILLIAMS FOR INSTANCE HAS NO 
PROBLEM WITH THAT SORT OF SHOT 
I DON'T THINK HE WENT INTO THESE AS 
WELL AS HE COULD HAVE DONE THEY 
COULD HAVE SPLIT BETTER THAN THAT 
ALL HE HAS GOT IS A SAFETY SHOT NOW 
HE HAS NOT PLAYED A VERY GOOD SHOT 
THAT IS A WEAK SAFETY IN FACT HE 
HAS NOT EVEN REACHED THE BALL 
CLIMBED THERE THE BAULK LINE 
ONE THING JOHN WILL BE FULLY AWARE 
OF AND HE IS A GREAT SAFETY PLAYER 
YOU CANNOT LET SOMEONE LIKE RYAN 
DAY GET HIS HANDS ON THE TABLE BUT 
THEN AGAIN RYAN CANNOT MISS THOSE 
THAT'S TWO SHOTS INTO THAT POCKET 
IN THIS FRAME 
HAVING MISSED THE 
BLACK HE IS ON A LUCKIER THAN OF 
THE BALL SO THAT HIGGINS ISN'T LEFT 
ANYTHING BUT IT IS STILL A BAD MISS 
DAY MAYBE SENSING THAT HE IS 
GETTING RIGHT BACK INTO THIS JUST 
PERHAPS GOT A BIT AHEAD OF HIMSELF 
HER THINK JOHN HAS JUST LOST SOME 
CONCENTRATION TWO OR THREE NOT SO 
GOOD SHOTS IN A ROW NOW I THINK 
JOHN WELL WORKED OUT 
IT WAS A GOOD DOUBLE THIS I THINK 
THERE MAY BE A PLANT ON 
HE WOULD LIKE TO BE A LITTLE BIT 
FURTHER UPON THIS HOW DOES HIS 
PLANT SHAPE UP NOT QUITE ON SO HE 
HAS GOT TO MAKE IT HE HAS GOT TO 
HIT THE FIRST RED AS YOU CAN SEE 
ABOUT THEIR ONTO THE SECOND ONE HE 
WILL GO UP FOR THE BLUE 
DID NOT IN THE FIRST READ FAR 
ENOUGH TO THE LEFT JAW DID NOT 
AIM FOR THE FIRST READ FAR ENOUGH 
TO THE LEFT JAW 
THIS IS A DODGY LITTLE SPELL FOR 
HIGGINS HE HAS HARDLY HAD ONE RIDE 
FOR THE LAST TEN MINUTES OR SO YEAH YEAH THAT WAS THE OPPOSITE TO THE LAST 
TWO THIS SERIES OF BAD SHOTS A 
SERIES AT THE MOMENT RYAN DAY HAS 
NOT QUITE TAKEN FULL ADVANTAGE 
JOHN HAS LOST HIS WAY A LITTLE BIT 
HE WAS ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING IN THE 
LAST FRAME WHERE HE BASHED BUT 
TABLE AS WE HAVE SEEN A COUPLE OF 
TIMES AND SINCE THEN HE SEEMS TO 
HAVE MADE A LOT OF SAFETY ERRORS 
WHICH IS NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL IT IS 
A VERY STRONG PART OF HIS GAME 
THEY COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER 
CHANCE THAN THIS TO LEVEL THE MATCH 
AT SIX TO SIX DAY COULDN'T ASK 
I THINK HE COULD I THINK IF HE 
COULD GET ON TO WAIT COLOUR HERE 
HE IS VERY CLOSE TO WINNING THE 
FRAME IT IS FRAME HE HAS HAD TWO 
OR THREE CHANCES IN IT WENT REALLY 
MATTER IF HE CAN GO ON TO ME GO 
ON TO WIN IT L. THINK HE WILL NOW HE ONLY NEEDS THIS RED 
IT IS GOING TO BE A GOOD INTERVAL 
FOR HIGGINS COMING UP IT WILL GIVE 
HIM A CHANCE TO REGROUP 
THIRTY SIX AND THE FRAME RYAN DAY JOHN JOHN HIGGINS IS STILL ANNOYED 
WHAT HAPPENED THERE DID HE HIT THE 
TABLE AGAIN 
IT WAS STRANGE BUT HE 
IS SHOWING FRUSTRATION JOHN 
HIGGINS IT IS UPSETTING FOR JOHN 
HIGGINS FANS 
HERE IT IS LET'S 
HAVE A LOOK 
HE PUT THE BALL IN THE 
POCKET WITH HIS HAND 
NOT THE 
NORMAL IS IT FROM JOHN 
SIGN OF 
TEMPERAMENT SHALL WE SAY HE IS 
OBVIOUSLY NOT HAPPY BUT RYAN DAY 
IS PLAYING GOOD STUFF 
ITS CREDIT 
IS IT SHOWS HOW MUCH HOW IMPORTANT 
IT IS TO EVERYONE 
FROM FOUR TO ZERO IN 
FRONT JOHN HIGGINS WOULD HAVE 
EXPECTED TO FORGE AHEAD HE HAD 
RYAN DAY COLD AND THIS MATCH AND 
ALL OF A SUDDEN RYAN DAY HAS WON 
SIX OUT OF THE LAST EIGHT FRAMES A 
SUPERB RECOVERY 
WHAT ARE YOUR 
OBSERVATIONS ABOUT RYAN DAY HE HAS 
CHARGED AT THE WORLD RANKINGS HE HE IS A PLAYER WHO IS READY TO WIN HE 
HAS BEEN IN A FINAL IN CHINA A 
FINAL IN WATER HE IS A PLAYER WHO 
IS BUBBLING UNDERNEATH AND EXPECTED 
HIM TO 
CLOSE IT SOON BUT HE IS A 
PLAYER WE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO 
LIFT THE TROPHY SOON 
IT IS 
APPEARING THAT IT IS GOING TO BE 
MORE DIFFICULT TO CALL THAN WE 
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
WHEN I SAW THE 
WAY JOHN HIGGINS KENWRIGHT IN THE 
FIRST SESSION OF LAST NIGHT I 
THOUGHT I HAVE GOT THIS WRONG WHEN 
YOU GET TO PLAYERS COLLIDING WHO 
WAS PLAYING PRETTY GOOD STUFF IT 
IS HARD TO JUDGE AND THE SESSIONS 
ARE SPLIT EIGHT AND NINE WHATEVER HAPPENS 
IN ONE SESSION IS NOT ALWAYS WHAT 
IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT ALL 
OF A SUDDEN NOW IT LOOKS AS THOUGH 
IT WOULD BE A CLIFFHANGER IN THE 
END 
TIME TO POP DOWN TO SHEFFIELD END TRAIN STATION BECAUSE IN THE RUN UP 
TO THEIR TOURNAMENT JOHN AND SHAUN 
MURPHY WHERE COACHING THE COMMUTERS HELLO 
I'M NATALIE 
NICE TO MEET HELLO YOU WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW 
BUT THIS IS PRETTY HARD FOR 
AMATEURS 
IT IS TRICKY BUT OF THE AMATEURS BRIDGES'S HEART THANKS FOR THAT ALTHOUGH THE BRIDGE 
IT LOOKS EASY IT IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IF IT IS 
WOBBLY ON NOT STABLE THE CUE MOVES 
READINESS THE SHOT THE GENERAL 
IDEA IS TO GET IT AS STABLE AS 
INCOME THE OLD METHOD HE'S TO BE 
TO PUT THEIR HAND FLAT SPREAD THE 
FINGERS THIS IS THE HARDEST PART 
YOU RAISE THE KNUCKLES UP BUT 
WITHOUT BENDING YOUR FINGERS THIS 
FORMS A STABLE BASE THEN YOU BRING 
THE FAMINE TO CREATE THE V. 
THIS IS 
THE BIT THAT MOST PEOPLE COME 
UNSTUCK WITH THEY SAY I CANNOT 
MOVE MY THUMB RAY REARDON HAS A 
FUNNY THUMB AND CANNOT DO IT IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO GET A DECENT BRIDGE 
BUT YOUR HAND THEIR NYSTRAND FLAT 
SPREAD YOUR FINGERS PUT YOUR 
HAND THERE MY SON FLAT THAT'S NOT 
BAD HELD AT LIKE THAT FOR TWELVE HOURS 
SOLID AND YOU SHOULD BE O. K. O. K. 
THAT'S NOT BAD 
A LOT OF PEOPLE SCREW WITH A THUMB 
OVER ORDER NOT GET THE PADS ON 
THEIR THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD WHAT 
YOU DID DO IT AGAIN YOU CAN STICK THIRD CUE THROUGH 
THERE CAN YOU DO IT YEAH THAT'S YEAH THAT'S PRETTY DECENT JUST HIT THE CUE 
BALL NOW HE POTTED THE BLACK AS 
WELL MARVELLOUS THAT WILL BE TWENTY FIVE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU 
ONE DAY I MIGHT JUST SURPRISE JOHN 
PARROTT THE BRIDGE AND IS 
DEFINITELY IMPROVING A BRIDGE 
HAND TIME FOR SHAUN MURPHY TO PUT 
HIS KNOWLEDGE TO GOOD USE 
THE FIRST YEAR I CAME HERE I 
PLAYED PAUL HUNTER HE PLAYED WELL 
AGAINST ME L. L. MANAGED TO RECOVER TO 
NINE TO FIVE AND ENDED UP LOSING TEN TO FIVE LAST 
YEAR WAS BY BREAKTHROUGH REALLY 
GOT THROUGH TO THE QUARTER FINALS 
UNLUCKY NOT TO GET TO THE SEMI 
FINALS AS PIPPED TO THE POST BY 
MARK SELBY MY FIRST MATCH AGAINST 
BARRY HAWKINS WE ARE GOOD FRIENDS 
I DID NOT PLAY PARTICULARLY WELL IN 
THAT PLAYING IN THAT GAME NOR 
DID HE WAS THREE TO ZERO DOWN AND HE 
DIDN'T DO MUCH AT ALL IT TURNED 
AROUND A LITTLE BIT BEFORE WE KNEW 
IT IT WAS NINE TO NINE BUT THAT POINT IN 
TIME I PROBABLY DIDN'T THINK I WAS 
GOING TO WIN WHEN I GOT CALLED OFF 
IT WAS TO MY ADVANTAGE WE BOTH HAD 
CHANCES IN THE DECIDER AND WAS 
LUCKY TO CAPITALISE AND WIN SEAN 
IS VERY CONFIDENT AT THE MOMENT 
THAT IS HIS GREAT STRENGTH HE HAS 
WON LOTS OF MATCHES HE HAS WON 
TOURNAMENTS HE IS VERY HAPPY IN 
HIS PERSONAL LIFE I WOULD IMAGINE 
HE HAS GOT EVERYTHING GOING FOR HIM 
HE IS YOUNG YOUNGER THAN ME HE 
HAS GOT IT ALL ON HIS SIDE AT THIS 
POINT IN TIME THE ATMOSPHERE HERE 
AND THE TWO TABLE SET UP I'VE BEEN 
LUCKY ENOUGH I HAVEN'T BEEN LUCKY 
ENOUGH TO GET DOWN TO THE ONE TABLE 
SET UP AS YET WILL TRY AND GET THERE 
SHAUN MURPHY THE WORLD THERE CHAMPION IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE MOST 
CONSISTENT PLAYER ON THE CIRCUIT SO 
FAR THIS SEASON LET'S JOIN THIS 
MATCH AND THE VERY FIRST FRAME 
ONLY ONE BALL POTTED AND THEIR 
COMMENTATORS ARE DENNIS TAYLOR AND 
WILLIE THORNE THE COMMENTATORS 
ARE 
I THINK TO WIN THIS MATCH ALI 
CARTER NEEDS TO GET OFF TO WAY GOOD 
START GOOD START THIS IS A BETTER OPPORTUNITY 
DIDN'T GET THE REQUIRED SCREW ON 
THE CUE BALL TO GET BACK TO THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE BLUE HE HAS TO 
POWER THIS ONE IN NOW NO POINT IN 
RUNNING IN BECAUSE THERE IS NO RED 
AVAILABLE EITHER SIDE OF THE PINK 
SPOT 
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO KISS THE 
BROWN THERE THERE A BIT CLOSE 
TO THE CUSHION THOUGH AT LEAST HE 
HAS GOT A SHOT AT THE POT THE THE BROWN MAYBE THE BALL HE DECIDES TO 
GO ON NOW 
THE GREEN IS STILL A POT BUT A LOT 
TO DO THE CUE BALL THE BLUE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN PERFECT A LOT TO DO 
WITH THE CUE BALL WELL PLAYED 
HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL HE COULDN'T QUITE GET INTO THE CUE 
BALL THAT IS THE KEY IN THIS 
FRIEND IT IS THOSE TWO REDS WHICH 
ARE STOPPING THE PERFECT POSITION 
FOR THE BLACK THIS IS GOOD 
EFFORT FOR ALI CARTER IT IS A BIG 
MATCH FOR HIM OF COURSE HE HAS 
BEEN A BIG IMPROVER ALI CARTER 
OVER THE YEARS IT HAS BEEN SAID IN 
CERTAIN AREAS HE SOMETIMES LETS 
FRAME WINNING LEADS DISAPPEAR IN 
MATCHES BUT HE IS WONDERFUL 
BREAKER A LITTLE CANNON HERE TO 
STAY ON THE BLACK A VERY GOOD 
SCORER GREAT CUE ACTION 
AND NOW HE HAS DEVELOPED THESE INTO 
A CHANCE TO WIN THE FRAME AT THIS 
VISIT 
JUST TWO OR THREE SHOTS AWAY FROM 
WINNING THE FRAME BUT HIS KEY WHEN 
YOU'RE PLAYING THE OPENING GAME OF 
A MATCH TO KEEPER OPPONENT SAT IN 
HIS CHAIR HE NEED TO TRY AND MAKE 
SURE YOU KEEP YOUR OPPONENT SAT 
DOWN STOP HIM GETTING IN THE TABLE 
TIME ANY TABLE TIME 
THIS IS JUST THE START THAT ALI 
CARTER WAS LOOKING FOR HE IS A 
TERRIFIC PLAYER 
THE FRAME IS SAFE BUT HE WANTS TO 
TRY AND SEE IF HE CAN KEEP THE 
BREAK GOING 
ALI CARTER WILL TRY HIS HEART OUT 
TO MAKE A CENTURY AT THE CRUCIBLE 
IT IS ALWAYS A THRILL 
HE NEEDS SOME SORT OF ANGLE ON THIS 
RED 
HIS HIGHEST BREAK HIS ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR AND HE 
MADE THAT LAST YEAR 
HE HAS HAD EIGHT CRUCIBLE CENTURIES 
HE HAS HAD EIGHT CENTURIES THIS 
SEASON 
HE DESERVES A CENTURY THIS HAS 
BEEN A TOP CLASS BREAK 
THAT IS A SHAME 
IT IS SO UNLUCKY 
BUT WHAT A START FOR ALI CARTER 
YOU CAN'T DO BETTER THAN WIN THE 
FRAME IN ONE VISIT 
A GOOD START BY ALI CARTER HE IS 
THIRTEEN BEHIND IN FRAME TWO 
WELL THAT HE IS ONE OF THE BEST 
FLUKE AS YOU WOULD EVER WISH TO SEE 
INCREDIBLE HE IS PLAYING SAFETY 
SHOT HERE YOU NEVER SEE THIS AGAIN 
I PROMISE YOU THAT IS ONE OF THE 
ALL TIME GREAT FLUKES 
OH DEAR ALI THAT IS REALLY A BAD 
MISTAKE HE PROBABLY FELT 
EMBARRASSED ABOUT THE FLUKE HE HE MISJUDGED THE SCREW SHOT L. WOULD 
STILL HAVE A GO AT THIS RED INTO 
THE RIGHT CORNER AND STUN OVER FOR 
THE BLUE IF HE MISSES IT COULD GO 
BEHIND THE PINK OR BLACK 
NOW CAN HE SCREW STRAIGHT DOWN 
ODYSSEY AT THE USER CUSHION 
ODYSSEY HAVE TO USE THE CUSHION 
HE NEEDS UP TO AND INCLUDING THE 
PINK TO BE SURE IT IS A BID BODY 
BLOW FOR SHAUN HE WAS IN THE BALLS 
QUITE NICELY EARLIER ON HE MISSED 
THE RED TRYING TO GET TOP SIDE OF 
THE PINK HE PLAYED BRILLIANT 
SAFETY SHOT BEFORE ALI GOT THE 
FLUKE CAN'T BELIEVE THAT CUT WENT IN AT THAT PACE 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO HIT THIS TOO 
HARD 
THAT WAS A BIT HARD I THINK IT IS 
CARELESS 
IF HE POTS THE BLUE HE WILL ONLY 
BE THIRTEEN IN FRONT 
WELL PLAYED SO A LONG STRAIGHT 
PINK TO TAKE THE SECOND FRAME AFTER 
THAT OUTRAGEOUS FLUKE 
THEY ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT 
THOSE SHOTS BUT THAT FRAME WILL 
HURT MURPHY CARTER LEAD TWO TO ZERO 
WELL PLAYED ALI CARTER MORE LATER 
NOW LET'S RETURN TO THE JOHN 
HIGGINS RYAN DAY MATCH JOHN 
HIGGINS HAS MET A GOOD LEAD BE 
SURRENDERED HE HAS SHOWN HIS 
FRUSTRATION BUT RYAN DAY IS 
CHIPPER THE PLAYERS ARE BACK IN 
THE ARENA SO FROM THE CUE ZONE 
BACK INSIDE THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE 
FRAME THIRTEEN IS UNDER WAY NEAL FOULDS 
AND CLIVE EVERTON ON IN THE 
COMMENTARY BOX 
I DON'T THINK SHAUN 
MURPHY HAS CALMED DOWN HE HAS 
MISSED THAT RED IT HAS ADDED TO 
HIS FRUSTRATIONS BUT SNOOKER IS 
THERE VERY CHARACTER FORMING GAME 
YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO COPE WITH 
FRUSTRATION FOR WHATEVER FORCE IT 
COMES FROM WHATEVER SOURCE IT 
COMES 
IN LAST FRAME BEFORE THE INTERVAL 
MURPHY MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES AND 
HE WAS CLEARLY FEELING VERY THE 
ANGRY INDEED VERY ANGRY INDEED 
THAT WAS A PUSH SHOT 
HE CALLED IT ON HIMSELF THAT AT 
LEAST TWICE THE 
CUE 
IT JUST DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT DID IT 
ALWAYS A DANGER PLAYING A FULL BALL 
SHOT WITH PACE WITH THE CUE BALL 
AND OBJECT BALL ARE CLOSE TOGETHER 
DIFFICULT TO TIME IT 
NOT AN EASY RED THAT BUT NO SIGN 
THAT HIGGINS IS GETTING HIMSELF 
TOGETHER AGAIN 
EARLY IN THE MATCH HIGGINS'S POT 
SUCCESS WAS NINETY SEVEN PER CENT AND THE 
ONES HE MISSED WERE AFTER HE HAD 
SECURED THE FRAME 
DAY HAD HIT HAD HIS OWN 
FRUSTRATION LAST NIGHT THE THING 
HAPPENED WHEN HE CAME INTO THE 
ARENA FOR HIM LIKE PLAYING 
CHAMPAGNE SNOOKER AND THEN BEING 
UNABLE TO 
GET THE 
CORK OUT OF THE 
BOTTLE WHEN HE WAS FOUR TO ZERO DOWN HE 
DID DID IN AND WON THREE OF THE 
REMAINING FOUR FRAMES HE DID DIG 
IN 
HE MIGHT BE PLAYING TWO CUSHIONS 
IT ISN'T A NICE SHOT THE BLACK IS 
IN THE WAY OF COMING ROUND OFF TWO 
CUSHIONS AND THE MIDDLE POCKET IS 
IN THE WAY OF ROLLING UP TO THEM 
OFF ONE OFF ONE CUSHION 
HE MIGHT BE LOOKING TO SEE IF A RED 
WILL POT INTO LEVEL CENTRE THE 
LEFT CENTRE 
THAT HAD TO BE JUDGED JUST RIGHT 
FOUL AND A MISS A VERY DELICATE LITTLE SHOT THIS 
HE HAD TO GET THE PACE RIGHT 
OTHERWISE HE WILL PUSH RED ON L. L. 
THINK RYAN MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THE 
RED INTO THE CENTRE 
A TRICKY LITTLE SHOT IT WAS 
AWKWARD CUEING 
THIS IS A BIG FRAME 
NOW RYAN HAS HAD A COUPLE OF 
CHANCES BUT HE KNOWS THAT IF JOHN 
WINS THIS FRAME HE WILL BE BACK IN 
ACTION AGAIN AT THE MOMENT HE HAS 
GOT THE HUMP OUT THERE YOU CAN SEE 
THAT 
HIGGINS'S DISSATISFACTION AROSE 
INITIALLY FROM LOSS OF POSITION 
HE WAS PLAYING FOR THE BLACK RED 
BUT THE CUE BALL FLEW OFF THE 
CUSHION THEN AFTER MAKING 
COUNTLESS MISTAKES IN THE NEXT 
FRAME IN THE NEXT FRAME HE LEFT 
THE ARENA IN HIGH DUDGEON ONE 
MIGHT SAY 
I THOUGHT THE INTERVAL 
WOULD COME TO HIS RESCUE HE LOOKS 
MARGINALLY MORE CALM 
WHAT HAS RYAN LEFT THIS TIME IT 
WAS ANOTHER BAD SHOT THERE ARE 
FIVE BALLS STOPPING HIM FROM 
GETTING TO THAT ONE 
A MISJUDGED SAFETY FROM HIGGINS' 
THESE ARE WORRYING MOMENTS FOR JOHN 
THIS IS NOW A WONDERFUL CHANCE A 
LOVELY KIDS IT COULD BE THAT RYAN 
MIGHT TAKE THE LEAD THAT WOULD BE 
A HUGE BLOW PSYCHOLOGICALLY FOR THE 
DEFENDING CHAMP THE FORMER 
CHAMPION 
RYAN DAY'S REVIVAL STARTED BEFORE 
JOHN HIGGINS'S FRUSTRATIONS 
WELL JUST WHAT YOU NEED A NICE 
SMELLY SOCK BY YOUR HERE EAR 
ALL THOUGH I HAVE NO EVIDENCE THE 
SOCK IS SMELLY 
YOU DON'T GET MUCH 
PRIVACY OUT THERE AS A PLAYER THIS 
IS THE ONLY VENUE WAY YOU HAVE DO 
SIT NEXT TO THE PLAYER WHO MIGHT BE 
BEATING YOU 
HE PLAYED UP ON THE BLACK THIS IS 
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY THERE IS ONE 
MORE RED ON 
FINDING A WAY TO THE REDS ON THE 
LEFT OF THE TABLE IS ALL HE NEEDS 
REALLY 
HE PLAYED TO CREEP IN BEHIND THE 
RED L. THINK HE CAN JUST SEE ENOUGH 
OF THIS RED TO POTTED IT IS VERY 
TIGHT THAT WILL FREE UP THE OTHER RED JUST THIS RED THEN 
HE HAS TAKEN THIS WELL THERE WERE 
QUITE A FEW ON WHEN HE CAME TO THE 
TABLE BUT HE STILL HAD TO GET THEM 
SO MORE TROUBLE FOR JOHN HIGGINS 
DAY LEADS BY SEVEN FRAMES TO SIX 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE THE CROWD WERE 
FEW MOMENTS 
I HAVEN'T SEEN JOHN 
RESTRICTED FOR SO LONG USUALLY HE 
LET IT GO AS MOST PLAYERS DO HE 
DOES LOOK TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY 
ROCKED BY WHAT HAS HAPPENED IT 
DEPENDS ON YOUR OPPONENT IF YOUR 
OPPONENT PUNISHES YOU IT WOULD BE 
TWICE THE SITUATION 
I THINK RYAN 
IS THINKING IF I CAN DO MY 
BUSINESS I COULD GET A GOOD LEAD 
WHEN YOU GET THE HUMP HOW CAN YOU 
CONCENTRATE 
USUALLY SNOOKER CONCENTRATE PLAYERS ARE USED TO THIS SITUATION 
AND JUST LET IT GO THEY 
CONCENTRATE ON NO THE NEXT SHOT 
USUALLY 
THE CONCENTRATION 
YOU NEED 
ON THE GAME IT EXORCISES ALL OF IT 
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU GET THE HUMP IT 
CAN BRING THE BEST OUT OF YOU 
BECAUSE YOU'RE ANGRY HOW DO YOU 
WHAT THE BALANCE 
THAT IS DOWN TO 
THE INDIVIDUAL BUT HE HAD AN 
INTERVAL HE HAD A CHANCE TO BLOW 
IT ALL AWAY HE COULD JUST GO BLAST 
AND COME BACK OUT AND FOCUS COULD COULD IT BE THE CUSHIONS THE CONDITIONS 
IS HE AND FU WITH HIMSELF AND 
THE WITH HIMSELF ANGRY 
IT IS A 
TURNAROUND 
IT IS INTERESTING HOW TURNAROUND CERTAIN THINGS CAN GET TO YOU 
THERE IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THERE 
HE NEEDS TO GET A GRIP BACK ON THIS 
MATCH 
WHAT IS CLIVE'S READING ON MATCH THIS 
I THINK MOST PLAYERS 
ARE PHILOSOPHICAL IF FOR EXAMPLE 
THERE OPPONENT HAS A FLUKE AND 
CLEARS UP BUT I THINK THE SOURCE 
OF HIS FRUSTRATION TODAY IS 
BUSINESS ACTION WITH THE CAN DO 
IS DISSATISFACTION WITH THE 
CUSHIONS THAT ISN'T GOING TO 
CHANGE BECAUSE THE CUSHIONS STAY 
THE SAME L. L. THINK HE IS STILL 
SMOULDERING ABOUT THE FACT THAT 
CONDITIONS AREN'T PERFECT AND NOT 
AS GOOD AS HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO 
EXPECT 
THE ONE JOHN PUNCHED MIGHT EXPECT BE LOWER THAN IT WAS ORIGINALLY IT HAS A BIGGER BOUNCE TO 
LEAVE THE 
CUE BALL OUT 
OF BAULK 
AFTER THE 
JOHN HIGGINS SAFETY 
IT RETURNED TO THE BAULK CUSHION 
BUT GATHERS PACE 
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE DO 
ACCEPT THAT HIS OPPONENT IS PLAYING 
THE SAME QUESTIONS THEY BOTH KNOW 
WHAT THEY ARE LIKE NOW SO THEY 
HAVE NOT TO JUST COMPLETELY 
THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT THE SITUATION 
LET'S SAY ARE JUST COMPLETELY 
HE COULDN'T SEE THAT RED TO POT IT 
BUT SHOULD HAVE DONE BECAUSE POSITIONAL SHOT WAS EASY ENOUGH 
EVEN THAT ONE DIDN'T EXACTLY STOP 
QUICKLY 
THAT IS WHAT HIGGINS WANTED A 
MISJUDGED SAFETY FROM DAY TIME TO 
REASSERT HIMSELF 
HE HAD TO PLAY A GOOD SHOT TO GET 
ON A COLOUR AND HE HAS 
ONCE AGAIN HE HAS GONE TOO FAR BY 
A MILE THIS WAS ANOTHER BOUNCY ONE 
I DON'T LIKE TO GO ON ABOUT IT BUT 
THAT WENT QUICKER THAN HE THOUGHT 
HIS EXPRESSION TOLD US EVERYTHING 
WE NEEDED TO KNOW THIS IS TRICKIER 
INTO THE CENTRE HE WAS BRIDGING 
OVER THE RED THIS IS A CRITICAL MOMENT FOR JOHN 
THIRTY OR FORTY HERE WOULD MAYBE CALM HIM 
DOWN 
THIS COULD BE A KEY SHOT IT IS A 
GOOD SHOT THIS HAS POTENTIAL THE 
BALLS ALL IN OPEN PLAY 
IF HE CAN REMOVE THE REDS CAN JUST 
IN THE AREA ROUND THE BLACK HE 
WOULD BE FINE BUT IT IS THE SAME 
OLD STORY HE CAN'T BELIEVE HOW 
QUICKLY IT SHOT OFF THE CUSHION 
WELL FACED WITH AN OPERA SHOT 
EITHER WAY AWKWARD SHOT IT IS 
FRUSTRATING FOR HIM I MUST 
ACKNOWLEDGE AND IT SHOULDN'T 
REALLY BE HAPPENING 
NO BUT AS YOU 
SAID RYAN SEEMS TO BE COPING WITH 
IT WELL HE SEEMS TO HAVE FOUND A 
WAY OF ADJUSTING BETTER JOHN HAS 
CLEARLY GOT HIMSELF IN TROUBLE HE 
IS OUT OF POSITION 
IT IS AN EXCELLENT RECOVERY AT 
WORST HE IS ON 
THE PINK L. THINK THE BLACK IS COVERED BUT THE PINK WILL DO 
HE WOULD LIKE TO BE STRAIGHT ON 
THIS RED TO HOLD FOR THE BLACK 
A GOOD SHOT THAT SO THERE A 
LITTLE CRISIS IN THIS BREAK IS OVER 
THE LITTLE CRISIS 
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT EFFORT FROM 
JOHN HIGGINS 
HIGGINS WAS IN AND CARRIED OWN 
CHARACTERISTICALLY BLACK HUMOUR 
BUT HE HAS SETTLED IT LOOKS AS IF 
HE'S GOING TO CLINCH THE FRAME AT 
THIS VISIT 
A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK 
TO DO THEN THIS IS FRAME BALL 
WELL DONE I THINK HE HAS MADE A 
CONSCIOUS EFFORT SINCE HE LOST 
POSITION TO TRY AND AVOID USING 
THE CUSHIONS WERE POSSIBLE WHERE 
POSSIBLE THAT IS ANOTHER WAY OF 
PLAYING 
AND NOW AFTER ALL HIS PROBLEMS HE 
CAN MAKE CENTURY 
WHICH WOULD BE THE MARK OF A 
CHAMPION ESPECIALLY WHEN HE HAD AN 
AWKWARD RED WITH THE SPIDER 
BRIDGING OVER ABOUT SIX REDS 
A ONE HUNDRED BREAK I TELL YOU WHAT HE IS 
CURRENTLY THE WORLD CHAMPION 
WOULD HAVE BEEN A TWO OF PRINCE 
BEHIND IF HE HAD LOST THIS FRAME 
WOULD HAVE BEEN TWO OF FRAMES 
BEHIND 
SO IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT HE 
OVERCAME HIS FRUSTRATIONS 
LEFT HIMSELF A BIT THIN ON THE 
GREEN FOR THE CENTURY BUT THAT 
DOESN'T MATTER 
RELIEVED TO BE LEVEL BUT I THINK 
IT IS PRETTY CERTAIN NOW IT IS THE 
CUSHIONS THEY ARE NOT HAPPY THERE THERE WAS ASSURED THEIR WED JOHN PLAYED 
THE DROPPING ON THE BLACK AND HE 
HAS GOT A SHOT ON THE REDS THERE 
IS NO WAY HE IS ABOUT SIX INCHES 
OF POSITION YOU CAN SEE WHY HE'S 
GETTING A BIT FRUSTRATED IT SEEMS 
TO HAVE TO SPREAD A BIT 
WHY IS 
THIS HAPPENING TODAY 
DIFFICULT TO 
SAY THAT ALL BRITAIN'S BAULK 
CUSHION STARTING TO BOUNCE IS THAT 
PLAYERS LOSE JUDGMENT IN THE PACE 
PERHAPS IT IS A BIT DAMP THAT IS 
NOT THE CASE AT THE CRUCIBLE THE 
CLOTH START OFF WITH A SHEEN ON IT 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN STOPS TO WEAR 
OUT EFFECTIVELY OF THE RUBBER 
START TO COME APART L. THINK JOHN 
HIGGINS DID WELL THERE TO HAVE A 
SENSE OF HUMOUR 
HER DIFFICULT IS 
IT TO ADAPT 
WHEN YOU GET TOUCH 
SHOT YOU'RE PLAYING A SHOT NOT 
KNOWING WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO GET 
A BIGGER BOUNCE OR YOU PLAY IT 
ANOTHER TIME AND IT WILL GO DEAD 
ON YOU THERE IS THE CONSISTENCY 
THERE IS NO CONSISTENCY WE ALSO 
HAVE TABLE HE DOES SOMETIMES THE 
TEMPERATURE GETS A BIT WARM 
THAT WAS A BIT OF A SLASHED FROM 
DAY 
THEY HAD A BIT OF A CHAT BETWEEN 
FRAMES THE PAIR OF THEM THAT IS 
QUITE UNUSUAL THAT WAS TO MISS 
THE TROUBLE WAS HE HIT IT HALF 
BALL AND HE SENT THE RED THAT HE 
HAD ATTEMPTED FLYING INTO THE BUNCH 
IF HE IS STRAIGHT ON THE RED TO THE 
BOTTOM LEFT IT IS PRETTY GOOD HE 
CAN RUN THROUGH ON THE BLACK 
HIGGINS'S MISADVENTURES HAVE NOT 
AFFECTED HIS PUTTING VERY MUCH 
HE'S POTTING 
HIS POT SUCCESS HIGHLIGHT THAT HE 
HAS NOT PLAYED BADLY BY ANY MEANS 
JUST A FEW POSITIONAL SHOTS HAVE 
GONE WRONG RATHER THAN OBVIOUS 
POTS 
JOHN NOT INTERESTED IN GOING INTO 
THE CLUSTER HE IS JUST BUILDING A 
BIT OF CONFIDENCE BACK 
THERE WASN'T A HIGH PERCENTAGE SHOT 
GOING INTO THEN THERE GOING INTO 
THEM THERE 
HE HAS MANAGED TO TURN HIS IT WENT 
INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE WHICH IS 
ALWAYS GOOD SIGN TURN HIS ANNOYANCE INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE 
PLAYING INTO THE PACK OF REDS HE 
MIGHT GO ROUND TWO CUSHIONS HERE 
I THINK HE WENT ONE CUSHION A 
LITTLE TOO MUCH OF AN ANGLE ON THE 
BLUE FOR THAT L. THOUGHT THIS WAS 
NOT STRAIGHT ENOUGH FOR THE SHOT 
PERSONALLY NOT A BAD START THOUGH TO THE 
OF THE SESSION 
ATTEMPTED THE RED AND GLAD TO SEE 
THAT THE BLACK COVERS IT 
WHOEVER WINS THIS FRAME OR THE 
LAST IT IS GOING TO BE INTERESTING 
FINISH 
JOHN BEEN A CAGEY HERE HE KNOWS HE 
DOES NOT REALLY WANT TO GO INTO THE 
PACK OF REDS THE FIFTY FOUR LEAD IS A GOOD 
ONE WITH ALL THE COLOURS ON THEIR 
SPOTS OR NEAR THEIR SPOTS THE 
REDS ARE STILL WIDE OPEN 
JOE WILL NOT WANT TO GO INTO THE 
PACK EITHER JOHN 
THEY WANTED TO 
COVER THE ISOLATED RED 
HE HAS ACTUALLY GOT A NICE ANGLE ON 
THE BLUE HERE BUT I DO NOT THINK 
HE IS INTERESTED HE 
BEHIND THE BLUE BUT I DO NOT THINK 
THIS IS THE CONCERN HE WOULD LIKE 
TO KILL A COLOUR KILL THE GREEN 
PERHAPS THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL IT 
WHEN YOU PUT BALL SAFE 
THAT IS GOING TO MAKE IT MORE 
DIFFICULT FOR DAY TO CLEAR UP FOUL AND A MISS 
ALTHOUGH THERE IS A VERY LITTLE 
DISTANCE BETWEEN CUE BALL AND RED 
THE ONE THAT DAY NUDGED OUT HIS 
POTTABLE 
AND AT AN ANGLE NO REAL RISK OF A 
PUSH SHOT 
HE JUST CHECKED THE SCORES HE WILL 
KNOW THAT IF HE POTS THIS RYAN DAY 
CAN ONLY TIE THE FRAME SO HE JUST MADE SURE OF IT 
NOW IT MEANS THAT WHEN THEY WILL 
NEED AN EXTRA BALL TO WIN THE FRAME 
THE RE SPOTTED BLACK BUT HE IS AN 
AWFUL LONG WAY OFF 
JUST A GLIMMER OF HOPE IN THIS 
FRAME NOTHING MORE FIRST GET YOUR FIVE BLACKS 
THAT IS A GOOD START THAT IS WELL 
JUDGED THE RED WILL POT TO THE 
LEFT CENTRE 
HE WILL HAVE TO TAKE BLACKS WITH 
ALL OF THESE REMAINING FOUR REDS 
THAT IS MAST THAT IS A MASTER 
HE NEEDED A SHAKE A SHADE OVER 
RIGHT TO CANNON THE BUT AS HE 
WANTED TO BUT HE GOT TOO MUCH SPIN 
ON 
LEAVING THE LAW RED BUT WHICH 
HIGGINS CLINCHES THE FRAME THE 
LAW RED THE LAW RED 
COMES A TIME WHEN YOU JUST HAVE TO 
GET ON WITH THE GAME HE WILL NOT 
BE BEHIND OVERNIGHT HE IS BACK IN 
BUSINESS 
SOMETIMES A LITTLE BIT OF 
FRUSTRATION IF YOU TAKE IT OUT ON 
YOURSELF OR ON THE TABLE IN 
JOHN'S CASE IT CAN TAKE AWAY ALL 
THE FRUSTRATIONS HE MAY HAVE DONE 
THAT EVENTUALLY HERE HE IS 
MOTORING AGAIN 
BETTER OUT THAN IN 
IN TERMS OF FRUSTRATION INSTEAD OF 
JUST LETTING IT'S ENOUGH LETTING 
IT SIMLA JOHN HIGGINS REGAINS THE LEAD 
DURING THAT FRAME WE WERE HAVING A 
DISCUSSION ABOUT CLOTH ARE 
GENERALLY THEY ARE GOING TO CHANGE 
THE CLOTH ON BOTH TABLES TOMORROW 
NIGHT THAT IS A SCHEDULED CHANGE 
BUT A LOT OF THE PLAYERS HAVE BEEN 
AIRING CONCERNS 
APPARENTLY SO IT 
DOES DRAG DOWN THE STANDARD OF PLAY 
I PLAYED ON DAY THREE NEVER SAW A 
PROBLEM BUT THE CLOTHS THEY ARE 
VERY THIN WE HAVE THE FARCES 
CONDITIONS WE HAVE EVER HAD IN THE 
GAME AND WON THE RUBBER BEHIND THE 
CLOTHS COMES INTO PLAY WELL DID DID THE PLAYER NOT WANT PLAYERS NOT 
WANT A FAST CLOTHS 
YES THEY GET 
SHAVED A COUPLE OF TIMES THEY GO 
DOWN TO HAVING A NAP ON THE WHAT'S 
THE WEATHER BALLS JUST GO DEAD 
STRAIGHT THEY HAVE ASK FOR THOSE 
CONDITIONS ASKED SOMETIMES IT 
GOES OVER THE AGE IT IS GOOD VERY 
WARM IN THERE 
DOES THAT NOT 
COME WITH THE TERRITORY 
YES IT 
DOES WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MASTERS 
THEY WANT FAST GREENS THEY LIKE TO 
HAVE FAST GREENS THEY ARE 
PERFECTLY SMACK SNOOKER ALL OF A 
SUDDEN IT GETS TO THE SCARY STAGE 
WHEN THE CUSHIONS DO NOT MATCH THE 
CLOTH SUCH A SPEECH IF THEY PLAY 
FASTER THAN THE CLOTH BECAUSE THE 
RUBBER IS STARTING TO BOUNCE BUT 
THE PLAYERS FEEL THEY ARE PLAYING 
ON A PINBALL MACHINE IF THE BALL 
HITS THE ROBBER WITHOUT THE LIGHTS 
ON IT JUST ABOUT TO SOFTLY OFF THE 
RUBBER WHEN IT IS OPERATING THE 
BALLS ARE FLYING AROUND ALL OVER 
THE PLACE IT IS A BIT SIMILAR THE THE PINBALL WIZARD WHATEVER THE 
CONDITIONS THIS IS DEVELOPING INTO 
A CRACKING MATCH 
IT IS A GOOD 
MATCH JOHN WILL BE PLEASED WITH 
HIMSELF HE HAS GOT HIS COMPOSURE 
BACK HE IS HAVING A BIT OF A LAUGH 
ABOUT THINGS HE'S A CHAMPION HE 
HAS PLAYED TWO VERY GOOD FRIENDS 
DO YOU NOT THINK IT IS GREAT WHEN 
YOU SEE PLAYERS GET FRUSTRATED BUT 
WEATHER THE STORM AND COME BACK 
IT IS PART OF BEING A PROFESSIONAL 
SNOOKER PLAYER THAT IS WHY JOHN 
HIGGINS HAS WON SO MUCH 
THERE ARE INNUMERABLE CHALLENGES IN 
CHAMPIONSHIP SNOOKER SOMETIMES IT 
IS A TRICKY POSITION SOMETIMES AN 
UNEXPECTED ONE 
WE HAVE SEEN JOHN HIGGINS COPE WITH 
IMMENSE FRUSTRATION THIS AFTERNOON 
NEEDED A MUCH DINNER SAFETY THERE 
THOUGH MUCH THINNER SAFETY 
VERY POSITIVELY PLAYED JUST ABOUT 
EVERY RED SEEMED TO MOVE HEARING 
THE CLUSTER HERE IT IN THE 
CLUSTER 
HE DID NOT WANT TO FLICK ON THE 
FIRST RED IT CHANGED THE COURSE OF 
THE CUE BALL 
DIDN'T JUDGE THE IN AND OUT OF 
BAULK SHOT AS WELL AS HE WANTED 
THOUGH 
ON THE BLACK ACTUALLY 
HE 
HAS LOOKED AT IT HE PUTS A LOT OF 
THESE RYAN DAY POTS IT IS ONE 
OF HIS TRADEMARK SHOT THIS IS A 
FIDDLY SHOT TO PLAY HE HAS GOT 
THIN CUT INTO ABOUT THREE QUARTERS 
OF A POCKET 
IT WASN'T ONE OF THOSE THAT WILL GO 
OFF THE NEAR JAW BECAUSE THE RED 
WAS IN THE WAY 
HE HAS JUST HAD THE CUE BALL 
CLEANED HE IS A BIT STRAIGHT ON 
THAT RED HE MAY HAVE LOOK AT 
DIFFERENT SHOT IT IS HARD TO SEE 
HOW HE CAN GET THE CUE BALL AWAY 
FROM THERE 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THAT RED WAS 
JUST OFF STRAIGHT WRONG SIDE 
BUT HE HAD NO PROBLEM WITH THE 
ALTERNATIVE 
HE HAS GOT LOTS OF CHOICES NOW THE 
REDS ARE EVERYWHERE 
HE HAS GOT A NICE ANGLE ON THE RED 
THIS TIME 
DIDN'T PLAY IT WELL THOUGH HE IS 
MEANT TO COME LOT FURTHER UP THE 
TABLE HE NEEDS TO STOP THE CUE 
BALL FROM GOING TO FOLLOW UP 
GOING TOO FAR UP 
THERE WAS AN NATURAL CANNON ONTO 
THE RED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL 
GOLDEN CHANCE TO WIN THE FRAME AND 
ADJOURN FOR THE DAY AT EIGHT TO EIGHT 
SO MANY REDS ON STILL BUT ANYWHERE 
IN THAT PERIOD HE WAS SURE TO BE 
ON SOMETHING ANYWHERE IN THAT 
AREA 
JOHN HIGGINS WILL BE AWARE WHAT A 
DANGEROUS PLAYER HE IS HE IS NOW 
SCORING ON PAR WITH JOHN THERE 
HAS BEEN DECENT BREAKS FROM BOTH 
PLAYERS IN THIS SESSION HE HAD A 
KICK THERE HE STILL NEEDS RED 
AND A COLOUR THANKFULLY FROM HIS 
PERSPECTIVE HE IS ON THE ONE TO 
THE MIDDLE 
THE GREEN TO GO SIXTY EIGHT IN FRONT AND 
SIXTY SEVEN ON THE TABLE 
NOW A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THE 
FRAME BEYOND DOUBT 
RYAN DAY RESUMED FIVE TO THREE DOWN THIS 
AFTERNOON HE DROPPED FURTHER BEHIND TO SIX TO THREE 
BUT HE WON FOUR CONSECUTIVE FRAMES 
TO LEAD SEVEN TO SIX HE LOST THE NEXT TWO 
TO FALL BEHIND AGAIN 
BUT HE HAS NOW EFFECTIVELY LEVELLED 
THE MATCH 
HE PROBABLY THOUGHT OVER NIGHT THAT 
HE NEEDED TO WIN THIS SESSION SO 
HE HAS DONE THAT ALL TO PLAY FOR 
THE SPECTATORS WOULD HAVE LIKED HIM 
TO FINISH WITH A CENTURY BUT HE IS 
QUITE HAPPY WITH NINETY THREE AFTER TWO OF 
THE THREE SESSIONS IT IS EIGHT EIGHT 
OVERNIGHT 
THE FINAL FRAME IS TOMORROW MORNING 
EIGHT TEN AM START AT TEN A M. START YOUR 
ASSESSMENT OF THE SESSION OVERALL 
FANTASTIC RYAN DAY WILL BE 
THINKING THAT GOING IN NINETY SEVEN WOULD BE 
THAT BAD BUT TO GET OUT AT EIGHTY EIGHT 
FANTASTIC IF HE LOOKS AT IT IN THE 
COLD LIGHT OF DAY ALL TO PLAY FOR 
JOHN HIGGINS SHOWED FRUSTRATION 
THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT THE CONDITION 
OF THE TABLE HE HAS WEATHERED THE 
STORM GOT BACK AND RYAN DAY HAS 
FOUGHT BACK 
RYAN LOOKS LIKE A TOURNAMENT WINNER 
WAITING TO HAPPEN HIGGINS LOOKS AS 
THOUGH HE WILL GET BACK TO HIS BEST 
FORM IT WAS A RECIPE FOR A GOOD 
MATCH AND THAT IS WHAT THEY GOT 
SHED SOME LIGHT FOR US ON THE ISSUE 
OF THE CLOTH THE CUSHIONS AND HER 
BOUNCY THEY ARE 
I WILL SHOW YOU 
HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE IT WILL 
MAKE IF THE CUSHION BOUNCE IS 
STRONG TO THE NORMAL BOUNCE BY 
WILL RECREATE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS 
LET'S SAY IT IS A BRAND NEW CLOTH 
IT HAS A LOVELY SHEEN ON IT IT IS 
AS FLUFFY AND AS CUSHIONED AS IT 
COULD POSSIBLY BE L. WILL WROBEL 
I WILL ROLL THE WHITE BALL ON TO 
THE CUSHION AND IT WILL COME BACK 
TO THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE 
THEY ARE AT STAKE ARE FEW MORE DAYS 
IN IS HIS DAY SEVEN THE CLOTH IS 
WEARING OUT SLIGHTLY THERE IS LESS 
OF A CUSHIONING EFFECT AND THERE IS 
MORE FRICTION INVOLVED L. HAVE 
CHEATED A BIT BY HAVE LOADED THE 
CUSHION UP WITH CHALK THERE IS 
MORE FRICTION BECAUSE OF THAT THAT 
SAME SHOT ROUGHLY THE SAME POWER 
ON IT IT HAS GONE ANOTHER FOR IT 
IT IS SIDE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL 
DIFFERENT SITUATIONS ATMOSPHERIC 
CONDITIONS IT IS A SNOOKER 
PLAYER'S NIGHTMARE 
FASCINATING BUT 
IF WE GO BACK IN TIME AND WE HAVE 
GOT CLIFF THORBURN'S ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
AGO 
WHAT DOES THIS SUGGEST DON'T AGO DON'T LOOK AT THE FLICK HE GETS BUT LOOK 
AT THE FINGERMARKS BUT AT THE 
BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER AND FRITES 
NEAR THE CUE BALL AS WELL YOU CAN 
SEE HOW MUCH THICKER THE COFFERS 
HE DID SAY FLUKE FAIR THE ACTUAL 
FINGERMARKS AND THE COSTS ARE SO 
MUCH THICKER THEY ARE MORE 
PREVALENT YOU CAN SEE THAT THE 
CLOTH IS THICKER 
THAT SUGGESTS 
THAT THE PLAYERS DID WANT FASTER 
CLOTHS DOWN THE YEARS SO THERE IS A 
CLIFF WITH FINGERMARKS EVERYWHERE 
PLAYERS DEMAND FASTER TABLES THEY 
HAVE GOT WHAT THEY WANT BE CAREFUL 
WHAT YOU WISH FOR 
ABSOLUTELY HERE 
IS ANOTHER CLIP FROM CLIFF THORBURN 
THIS IS A SAFETY SHOT IT IS COMING 
DOWN THE TABLE IT'S NOT EVEN GET 
INTO THE YELLOW SPOT YOU CAN SEE 
THE DIFFERENCE COMPLETELY THEY 
HAVE ASKED FOR THE SHAVED CLOTHS 
THEY HAVE GOT THEM THERE IS 
PROBABLY AN ARGUMENT FOR GOING BACK 
TO WEIGH SLIGHTLY THICKER CLOTH 
NOW WHATEVER THE CLOTH IS GOING TO 
BE IT IS THE SAME FOR BOTH PLAYERS 
ABSOLUTELY AS IS UP TO YOU TO GET 
USED TO THE CONDITIONS THERE MAY 
BE A CASE FOR HAVING A SLIGHTLY 
THICKER CLOTH 
EVERY AFTERNOON THIS 
WEEK WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM A 
VARIETY OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT 
THEIR GREAT AFFECTION FOR THE GAME 
OF SNOOKER IT IS A FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON WE WILL HEAR FROM A 
WEDNESDAY STRIKER MARK BRIGHT 
WHEN I PLAYED FOR LEICESTER CITY'S 
IN THE EIGHTIES AND GARY LINEKER WAS 
THERE HE IS QUITE GOOD ACTUALLY 
THE REST OF THE BOYS USED TO GHOST 
DOWN STRAIGHT AFTER TRAINING HAVE 
LUNCH AND PLACE IT AFTER ALL 
AFTERNOON I WAS NEVER ANY GOOD IT 
WAS FOOTBALL FOR ME WE USED TO GO 
DOWN TO WILLIE THORNE SNOOKER 
CENTRE ALL THE TIME ALL THE 
PLAYERS DID YOU CAN BE SITTING 
DOWN FOR HALF AN HOUR AND WATCHING 
YOUR OPPONENT POT BALL AFTER BALL 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE MISSES FROM 
SITTING DOWN STILL RELAXING 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET UP CONCENTRATE 
FOCUS IN MY INDUSTRY FOOTBALL IT 
IS NINETY MINUTES AND YOU ARE INVOLVED 
ALL THE TIME YOU ARE INVOLVED WITH 
IT BUT THIS IS SO STOP AND START 
YOU MIGHT MISS AN EASY RED AND HAVE 
TO SIT BACK DOWN AND WAIT YOU 
MIGHT NOT GET ANOTHER CHANCE IT IS 
A SPECIAL PLACE THE ATMOSPHERE 
BILLS AND YOU COULD FEEL THE 
INTENSITY IN THERE ONE YEAR I 
THINK IT WAS NINETEEN NINETY FOUR PAUL INCE CAME 
OVER AND WE WENT DOWN THERE AND 
WHAT THE PLAYERS I TO DO HIS MIX OF 
THE OTHER PLAYERS GO BACKSTAGE 
WATCH THEM PRACTICE CHAT AND 
BANTER IT IS SO RELAXED WOULD 
NOT BE LIKE THAT BEFORE A GAME OF 
FOOTBALL THAT IS WHAT THEY DO 
THEY SWITCHED THEIR CONCENTRATION 
ON AND OFF BEEN IN SHEFFIELD FOR 
FOUR YEARS AND SING IT ON THE 
TELEVISION AND KNOWING IT IS DOWN 
THE ROAD YOU GO DOWN THERE AND 
WATCH IT IT IS A VERY SPECIAL 
PLACE I ADMIRE STEVE DAVIS SO MUCH 
FOR WHAT HE ACHIEVED HENDRY CAME 
ALONG AND IT SEEMED LIKE HE 
COULDN'T LOSE THINK IT WAS NINETY FOUR 
HE PLAYED JIMMY WHITE AND I HAVE 
MET JIMMY WHITE BEFORE IN THE 
BRISTOL SNOOKER CENTRE L. THINK HE 
IS THE FANS' FAVOURITE SO EVERYBODY 
ROUTES FOR HIM ON OCCASION 
EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT IS NEVER IN 
THE BACK BUT YOU ALWAYS THINK THIS 
IS HIS CHANCE THIS IS HIS MOMENT 
THE MOMENT WAS WHEN HE MISSED THE 
BLACK OFF A SPOT AND THERE WERE BIG 
GROANS FROM THE AUDIENCE STEPHEN 
HENDRY CAME BACK CLAWED IT BACK 
AND WENT ON TO WIN ADD THEM AT 
THAT MOMENT HE THOUGHT IS HE EVER 
GOING TO WEAR IT ADMIRATION FOR 
STEPHEN HENDRY BUT FOR A JOURNEY 
JUST THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY FOR 
JIMMY IF I AM IN AND I CAN GET IT 
AND ALWAYS TRY AND WATCH IT BUT NOT 
AS MUCH AS I USED TO OBVIOUSLY 
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS KIDS TAKE 
YOUR MIND OF CERTAIN THINGS L. WILL 
BE WATCHING 
LET'S GET BACK TO THE 
SHAUN MURPHY SLASH ALI CARTER MATCH THE 
WINNER GOES THROUGH TO THE QUARTER 
FINALS OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP LET'S 
PICK IT UP IN FRAME THREE WORLD NO 
THREE SHAUN MURPHY POTENTIALLY 
NUMBER ONE FOR NEXT SEASON THE 
MOST CONSISTENT PLAYER AND A 
CIRCUIT THIS SEASON AGAINST ALI 
CARTER CHAMPION FROM THREE YEARS 
AGO LET'S GO TO FRAME THREE 
COMMENTARY BY DENNIS TAYLOR AND 
WILLIE THORNE 
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS BUT EVERY 
TIME YOU PLAY A PLANT YOU NEVER 
SEEM TO GET THE WHITE IN A NICE 
POSITION HE CONCENTRATES SO MUCH 
ON THE PLANT HE HAS LEFT THE WHITE 
DRIFT TOWARDS THE CUSHION THIS IS 
A TOUGH BROWN HE IS FACED WITH 
HE PLAYED IT WELL THAT'S UNLUCKY 
IF HE SLIPS PAST THE BLUE HE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN PERFECT SLIPPED 
HE IS 
VERY UNLUCKY THERE ISN'T IT 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT CASE HE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN ON BOTH REDS 
KISS 
ALI CARTER PORT SAID AND WITH THAT 
SHOT EVEN THOUGH HE IS FORTY NINE BEHIND 
HE IS JUST ABOUT THE FAVOURITE TO 
WIN HIS FRAME IT IS ALL ABOUT THE 
RED NEXT TO THE YELLOW AT THE 
MINUTE DOES THE RED NEXT TO THE PINK POT 
HE PUT THE WHITE IN A POSITION 
WHERE HE WOULD HAVE HAD A CHOICE OF 
RED IT IS THE SORT OF THING YOU 
ALWAYS DO 
WHAT WOULD YOU BE THINKING ON THE 
LAST RED TO NOW DENIS WOULD YOU 
LIKE HIM TO GET THE BLUE TO MOVE 
THE RED 
YEAH I WOULD DEFINITELY 
BE PLAYING OF THE BLUE IF I GOT 
THAT FAR BECAUSE TO GET ON THE 
BROWN UP TO LEAVE AN ANGLE TO 
DEVELOP THAT RED WOULD BE VERY 
DIFFICULT 
HE HAS GOT A COUPLE OF POTS TO 
NEGOTIATE THE PLAN OF ATTACK WOULD 
BE BLACK THIS RED AND THEN 
HOPEFULLY GET ON THE BLUE IF YOU 
DO NOT CANNON THE YELLOW AND RED 
YOU SLIP PAST IT THEN YOU CAN PLAY 
THE STICKER HE HAS GOT FEW TO 
NEGOTIATE BEFORE HE GETS THAT 
SITUATION THEN YOU CAN PLAY THE 
SNOOKER 
IT IS AWKWARD TO GET THERE FROM THE 
PINK BECAUSE THE MIDDLE POCKET IS 
IN NO WAY TO TRY TO DISTURB THE RED 
I THINK THE PLAN NOW WILLIE WOULD 
BE TO MAKE SURE OF THE PINK AND 
THEN PLAYED A SNOOKER IN BEHIND THE 
YELLOW 
WOULD YOU BE TRYING TO GET YELLOW THE CUE BALL ON A SEMI CIRCLE OF 
THE DEAL LINE IF HE DOES THAT HE 
HAS TO AVOID BECAUSE ON THE BLUE 
AND THE KISS ON THE GREEN 
I THINK THAT WAS A NEGATIVE CHOICE 
THERE THE ONLY REASON I SAY THAT 
IF SHAUN MURPHY GETS THE RED SAFE 
HE MAY HAVE MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO WIN THE FRAME IN THE NEXT VISIT 
WHEREAS THE PINK IS SO A CERTAINTY 
I THINK THE SWERVE SHOT HE WOULD BE 
AS EASY AS ANYTHING THE SWERVE 
SHOT HERE WOULD BE AS EASY AS 
ANYTHING 
THE SWERVE WAS THE RIGHT SHOT BUT 
HE JUST DIDN'T GET ENOUGH ON IT 
AND WITH THESE THINNER CLOTHS 
YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE 
BIT MORE 
I THINK THAT RED WAS JUST PAST THE 
YELLOW WASN'T IT THAT MAKES A 
DIFFERENCE ON THIS SHOT L. DON'T 
KNOW WHETHER THE REFEREE WILL ASK 
FOR THE STILL SHOT 
THAT IS WHERE 
IT WAS LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT WHERE 
IT IS NOW IT'S ONLY A FRACTION OUT 
THAT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON NOW 
SO A LITTLE BIT MORE SWERVE 
BECAUSE IF HE HITS THE RIGHT SIDE 
OF THE RED HE WILL GET ITS SAY 
THAT'S NOT BAD HE WILL GET IT 
SAFE 
AND THIS IS A CHANCE FOR SHAUN 
MURPHY L. THINK IT WAS A BIT TOO 
RISKY TO TAKE THE POT THE WAY HE 
WAS BRIDGING OVER THE YELLOW THERE 
HE HAS OVER SCREWED THAT THIS IS A 
TEST OF YOUR NERVE 
HE CUED THAT BEAUTIFULLY HE REALLY 
DID A QUICK LOOK AT THE SCOREBOARD 
AND ALI CARTER FEARS THE WORST NOW 
HE DID HAVE THE CHANCE HE CAME 
BACK WITH A BREAK OF FORTY FOUR AND FOR ME 
PLAYED THE WRONG SHOT HE PLAYED 
THE SNOOKER AND THE BLANK BLACK 
HE COULD HAVE POTTED THE PINK AND 
PUT 
SHAUN MURPHY IN TROUBLE SHAUN MURPHY STARTED WITH A BREAK 
OF FORTY NINE AND ALI CARTER RESPONDED WITH 
A BREAK OF FORTY FOUR HE LOOKED IN GOOD 
SHAPE TO TAKE THE FRAME BUT THAN 
THIRTY THREE HAS GIVEN SHAUN MURPHY THE FRAME 
HE HAS GOT ONE ON THE BOARD BUT IT 
IS TWO TO ONE TO ALI CARTER 
MY CAREER HAS BEEN TO TWO STAGES IF 
YOU LIKE THE BIGGEST INFLUENCE UP 
UNTIL BECOMING PROFESSIONAL WAS 
MY DAD HE MADE SO MANY SACRIFICES 
HE HAD ME IN TRAINING SINCE THEN 
MY BIGGEST INFLUENCE HAS BEEN MY 
WIFE CLAIRE SHE IS A PART OF 
EVERY DECISION THAT TIMEX I MAKE 
SHE IS THERE BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOSE 
YOU NEED HARD AND WHEN YOU LOSE 
WIN 
YOU NEED SOMEONE TO 
CELEBRATE WITH AT BEST STRENGTHS 
WOULD PROBABLY BE THAT I ATE 
NOTHING NO ONE I AM BEATEN AND I AM 
QUITE GOOD AT WINNING MATCHES L. 
NEVER SAY NEVER AND I NEVER SAY DIE 
I ALWAYS THINK I CAN WIN BIGGEST 
WEAKNESS IS ONE I DO GET TO THE 
FINAL HURDLE AND PROBABLY JUST 
RELAX THAT A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH 
AND SOMETIMES LOSE TOO MANY 
WHERE I SHOULD HAVE WON 
ON WE GO WITH FRAME FOUR AND AFTER 
TEN MINUTES ONLY THREE BALLS HAVE 
BEEN POT OF HAVE BEEN POTTED 
THE YELLOW IS THERE TO GET HIM BACK 
UP TO THE REDS 
MID SESSION INTERVAL COMING UP 
AFTER THIS FRAME BEST OF TWENTY FIVE OVER 
THREE SESSIONS A TRAINED TO BE 
PLAYED IN A SESSION EIGHT FRAMES 
TO BE PLAYED IN THIS SESSION 
TO BE FAIR HE DIDN'T GET ENOUGH 
SCREW TO DEVELOP THE FOR REDS FOUR 
HE KNOWS THE BROWN COULD WIN HIM 
THE FRAME VERY GOOD 
NOT THE TALLEST OF PLAYERS ALI 
CARTER COULDN'T QUITE STRETCH 
AROUND TO REACH THAT WHAT WOULD HE 
BE ABOUT FIVE F. T. SEVEN 
IF HE HAD STOPPED A LITTLE SHORT OF 
THEIR HE COULD HAVE POTTED THE 
BLACK AND DEVELOPED THE REDS L. AM 
NOT SURE IF HE CAN STILL DO THAT 
POSSIBLY 
PLAYED IT WELL YOU CANNOT HIT THAN 
ANY BETTER THAN THAT YOU CANNOT 
HIT THEM HE GOT THROUGH THEM SO 
WELL 
IT IS A GREAT SHOT TO HAVE IN WELL YOUR ARMOURY THAT ONE 
A COUPLE OF DIFFICULT REDS THERE 
WHICH ALI CARTER WILL HAVE TO 
NEGOTIATE HE IS ALREADY THINKING 
ABOUT THEM THE ONE NEXT TO THE 
BLUE IS NOT ALL THAT BAD IT WILL 
GO INTO THE CORNER POCKET HE WOBBLED THAT ONE A LITTLE BIT THAT LOOKS GOOD TO ME 
LOOKING AT THE SCOREBOARD FOUGHT 
IN A DIFFERENCE SO THE PINK WILL 
ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE BUT IT IS JUST 
A NATURAL SHOT TO GO OVER AND MOVE 
THE RED 
SO THIS IS A GREAT START FOR ALI 
CARTER UP AGAINST THE FORMER WORLD 
CHAMPION AND TO BE FAIR HE COULD 
HAVE WON ALL FOUR FRAMES SO SHAUN 
MURPHY HAS A LITTLE BIT TO THINK 
ABOUT DURING THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL 
YES I AM SURE HE WAS INTERVAL AWARE THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE IN 
FOR A TOUGH MATCH BUT I HAVE BEEN 
IMPRESSED BY THE WAY ALI CARTER HAS 
STARTED THIS MATCH HE SAID THERE 
WHICH IS UNUSUAL CONSIDERING LAST 
SHE WAS THE FIRST TIME HE GOT TO 
THE QUARTER FINAL STAGES THAT WILL 
NOT WORRY HIM TOO MUCH SHAUN 
MURPHY I AM SURE REALISES THAT THE 
FRAME HAS GONE BEYOND DOUBT AND 
BARRING SNOOKERS IT WILL BE ALI 
CARTER THAT TAKES THE LEAD 
ON WE 
GO TO FRAME FIVE SHAUN MURPHY IS 
NINETEEN BEHIND HE HAS BEEN THE MOST 
CONSISTENT PLAYER ON THE CIRCUIT 
THIS SEASON BUT IS IN SOME OF 
TROUBLE THIS AFTERNOON HE IS 
LINING UP A PLANT IN THIS FRAME 
HE DESERVED TO FINISH ON A COLOUR 
AND IT COULD NOT HAVE TURNED OUT 
BETTER 
YES GREAT SHOT WASN'T IT BETTER IF HE PLAYS THE BLOW HE COULD DO 
WITH NOT MAKING ANY CONTACT WITH 
THESE REDS THE BLUE 
THAT IS A BAD MISS FROM SHAUN 
MURPHY HE WILL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL 
HERE HE CANNOT BENTE HE CANNOT 
AFFORD TO BE MISSING THOSE CHANCES 
THAT IS AT THE TYPE OF SHOT THAT 
SAPS A BIT OF YOUR CONFIDENCE 
HIS OPPONENT HAS PLENTY OF 
CONFIDENCE 
THERE ARE COUPLE OF SAVE EVENTS 
BUT ALI CARTER MAY HAVE THE FRAME 
SAFE BY THEN OF SAFE REDS 
HE STILL LOOKED PRETTY COOL SHAUN 
BUT HE WILL BE GETTING A LITTLE 
CONCERNED 
SO PINK OR BLUE OFF THIS EASY RED 
AND SHAUN MURPHY WILL NEED A 
SNOOKER JUST GETTING HIS LITTLE 
EXTENSION IS HE THAT IS PURELY 
BECAUSE OF THE RED ON THE CUSHION 
HE HAS TO JUST LEAN OVER THAT 
THAT PINK GOING IN MEANS REGARDLESS 
OF WHAT HAPPENS ALI CARTER CAN'T 
LOSE THIS SESSION EIGHT FRAMES TO 
BE PLAYED 
I THINK SHAUN MURPHY WILL STAY IN 
HIS SEAT HE SIGNALS TO THE REFEREE 
JAN VERHAAS BUT HE HAS HAD ENOUGH 
THIS IS A GOOD EFFORT THERE ISN'T 
MUCH ROOM TO GET IN BEHIND THE 
GREEN BUT I TELL YOU WHAT YOU 
WON'T SEE A BETTER SAFETY SHOT THAN 
THAT HE IS GOING TO SOMEHOW HAVE 
TO TRY AND NESTLE ON A RED BUT 
THAT WAS SOME SHOT THERE 
THAT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION 
FOR ALI CARTER AND HE NEEDED TO 
LAND ON THAT AND THAT SMILE TOLD 
YOU HE STUCK THE RED UP 
SO THIS IS THE THIRD CHANCE FOR 
SHAUN MURPHY AND HE HAS BEEN 
PRETTY FORTUNATE THIS FRAME SO HE 
HAS TO WRITE HIS GOOD LUCK AND 
KNOCK A FEW IN RIDE 
THE BLACK SPOT IS COVERED BY THE 
RED SO HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY 
ABOUT THE PINK SPOT WHICH IS NO 
PROBLEM CONSIDERING WHERE THE BALLS 
ARE 
HE WOULD HAVE TO DO SOMETHING 
PRETTY CARELESS BUT HAVING SAID 
THAT HE HAS MISSED A COUPLE OF 
EASY POTS IT IS TIME TO GO TO WORK 
SHAUN 
IF HE WAS FOUR TO ONE IN FRONT YOU WOULD 
SAY THIS WAS A CERTAINTY FOR SHAUN 
TO GO FIVE TO ONE IN FRONT BUT AS LONG AS 
HE IS CAREFUL YOU WOULD EXPECT HIM 
TO MAKE IT FOUR TO TWO 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE TWO REDS NEAR 
THE PINK SPOT HE WAS THINKING TWO 
OR THREE SHOTS AHEAD 
EVENTUALLY WITH THOSE REDS HE 
WOULD DO WITH THE RIGHT WHITE 
SITTING WHERE THE PINK IS 
THAT IS CLEVER BECAUSE OF THE 
SITUATION WITH THE PINK IT IS A 
CHANGE OF PLAN 
ELEVEN IN FRONT BLACK WILL BE EIGHTEEN 
HE NEEDS TO TWO REDS 
SHAUN'S POT 
SUCCESS RATE IS AT EIGHTY NINE PER CENT YOU 
NORMALLY NEED AT LEAST NINETY TO BE IN 
THE LEAD AND HIS 
SAFETY HASN'T 
BEEN UP TO SCRATCH DID TODAY UP 
TO SCRATCH TODAY 
LOOKING AT THE SCOREBOARD THE 
YELLOW IS THE EASIER POT TO GET TO 
THE RED 
SO PINK OR BLACK OFF THIS LAST RED 
THERE IS TOUCH OF PRESSURE ON THIS ONE 
SMOOTH CUEING WAS REQUIRED THERE 
WHITE IN THE HEART OF THE POCKET 
RIGHT IN THE HEART 
THAT WAS A 
FRAME BALL SO NO HEROICS FROM 
BLACK TO YELLOW JUST MADE YOURSELF 
A LONG POT 
IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE BLESSED WITH 
A GOOD TEMPERAMENT THAT IS WHAT 
THIS MAN HAS GOT SHAUN HAS HELD 
UNTIL TOGETHER BUT HE DIDN'T DO IT 
AT THE FIRST VISIT IN THIS FRAME 
AND THAT IS WHY YOU NEED TO AT THIS 
STANDARD THE BREAK OF FIFTY THREE COMES TO 
AN END BARRING SNOOKERS CARTER 
WILL LOSE THIS FRAME AND MURPHY 
WILL CLOSE THE GAP TO TWO 
IN FRAME SEVEN ALI CARTER AFTER 
FORTY FOUR POINT LEAD 
SHAUN MURPHY TRIED 
TO RUN UP BEHIND THE BROWN AND 
DIDN'T DO SO HE LOST THE ADVANTAGE 
THE BLACK LOOKED TO THIN THE PINK 
LOOKS TRICKY INTO THE MIDDLE 
ALI CARTER WILL NEVER GET A BETTER 
CHANCE THAN THIS TO WIN ANOTHER 
FRAME JUST THREE REDS AND THE 
COLOUR SEEDED NO PROBLEM THREE 
COLOURS INDEED NEEDED ALI 
CARTER SEEMS TO BE CERTAIN TO TAKE 
AT LEAST THEY TWO FRAME LEAD INTO 
TOMORROW'S SESSIONS 
THAT IS THE FRAME BALL HE HAS 
OVERSCREWED IT BUT HE IS ENOUGH 
AHEAD HE CAN JUST ROLL THIS INTO 
THE MINUTE MIDDLE POCKET 
A LOT TO THINK ABOUT NOW FOR THE 
FORMER WORLD CHAMPION 
HE HAS LOOKED VERY GOOD IN THIS 
OPENING SESSION ALI CARTER HIS 
HIGHEST BREAK WAS IN THE OPENING 
FRAME NINETY SEVEN BUT HE HAS BEEN PRETTY 
CONSISTENT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE SCORELINE 
HE TRIED A VERY VERY HARD GREEN 
BUT THERE WAS VERY COMFORTABLE 
FRAME FOR ALI CARTER BREAKS OF FORTY FIVE 
AND FORTY ONE HE EXTENDS HIS LEAD TO FIVE TO TWO 
IN THE FINAL FRAME ALI CARTER IS 
TO PLAY NO SCORE 
ALI IS LOOKING AT THE RED NEXT TO 
THE BLACK BUT IT ISN'T AVAILABLE 
PINK IS AVAILABLE INTO RIGHT CORNER 
OR LEFT MIDDLE THE ONLY PROBLEM IF 
HE PLAYS FOR THE PINK IT MAY BE 
TIED UP BECAUSE IT LOOKS AS IF 
THERE BLACK SPOT IS TIED UP AND THE 
PINK SPOT ALSO 
YEAH THERE IS A RED VIRTUALLY ON 
THE LITTLE CROSS THAT IS WHAT THEY 
USED TO MARK THE TABLES IN YOUR 
CLUB YOU HAVE A BIG BLACK SPOT TO 
BE SHOULD TABLES ALSO HAVE 
ALWAYS HAVE A CHALK MARK 
CHAMPIONSHIP TABLES 
HE TRIED TO 
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN WHICH THESE 
YOUNG PLAYERS DO ALL THE TIME IF 
THE PINK GOES INTO THE ON HIS OWN 
SPOT IT WILL BE IN THE AVAILABLE 
TO THE RIGHT CORNER OR LEFT MIDDLE 
HE CAN WIN THE MIDDLE THE FRAME 
WITH THESE PINKS HE IS ON IT NICELY 
A VERY COMPACT PLAYER ALI CARTER 
A NICE STYLE NOT A LOT CAN GO 
WRONG IT IS LIKE WATCHING IAN 
WOOSNAM PLAY GOLF HE IS ONLY SMALL 
NOT MUCH CAN GO WRONG WITH THE 
SWING ALI IS LIKE THAT VERY 
COMPACT 
HE IS A VERY DANGEROUS PLAYER HE 
SCORES HEAVILY NOT SOMEBODY YOU 
WANT TO DRAW IN THE FIRST ROUND HE 
SEEMED TO GO IN SPELLS WHERE HE 
PLAYS GREAT AND SUDDENLY DISAPPEARS 
HE HAS COVERED WITH ILL HEALTH 
SUFFERED WITH ILL HEALTH HE HAD A 
FEW STOMACH OPERATIONS AND IT IS 
NICE TO SEE HIM BACK FIGHTING FIT 
AND MAYBE THE CONSISTENCY WILL COME 
BACK THERE 
HE CAN PUT THIS PROPERLY 
THAT IS PROPERLY PRACTISE 
HE 
HE SUFFERED FROM CROHN'S DISEASE BUT 
HE'S BACK TO NORMAL 
THAT SEEMED TO 
FLY OFF THE CUSHION BUT IT HAS 
DONE HIM A FAVOUR HE NOW HAS THE 
PINK TO GO AN ANGLE OFF THE PINK 
TO GO INTO THE REDS IF HE WANTS TO 
WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING WELL WHEN YOU 
SPLIT THE REDS LIKE THAT YOU 
ALWAYS SEEM TO GET NICE RUN HE 
HAS BEEN PLAYING WELL AND THAT 
WENT OUT VERY NICELY 
WHAT A SESSION THIS COULD BE IF 
SOMEONE HAD TOLD ALI CARTER HE 
WOULD BE LEADING SIX TO TWO AFTER THE 
FIRST SESSION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
MORE THAN DELIGHTED SHAUN MURPHY 
MUST BE IN A BIT OF SHOCK HE IS 
QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING THIS ALI 
CARTER HE BEAT STEPHEN HENDRY LAST 
YEAR AT THIS STAGE 
HE STARTED THE MATCH WITH A BREAK 
OF NINETY SEVEN WHICH IS THE HIGHEST SO FAR 
HE MAY FINISH THE SESSION WITH ONE 
HIGHER THAN THAT 
HE IS LEAVING HIMSELF LOW ON THE 
BLACK TO FLICK THE LEFT OF THE REDS 
OUT PERFECT TO THE INCH WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED THAT ONE 
HE HAS HAD TWENTY CENTURY BREAK SO AT 
THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE THAT IS 
PRETTY GOOD IN FACT IT IS EIGHT 
CENTURIES TWENTY CENTURIES THIS SEASON 
IT WILL BE TOUGH TO GET THE CENTURY 
HERE BUT IT WOULD BE A NICE WAY TO 
FINISH THE SESSION 
TWO REDS TWO 
BLACKS HE HAS A CHANCE TO DO IT 
HE JUST HAS TO THINK TWO MORE 
SESSIONS TO PLAY IF I CAN SHARE 
THEM I AM THROUGH 
SHAUN MURPHY 
NEEDS TO WIN THE SESSION FIVE THE NEXT 
TIME TO GO BACK IN THE MATCH FIVE TO THREE 
WHAT A SHAME NOT A TOTAL CLEARANCE 
BUT ALI CARTER PLAYED THE BETTER 
SNOOKER THIS AFTERNOON LEADS SIX TWO TWO WELL PLAYED ALI CARTER 
OVERALL WE ARE ABOVE AVERAGE FOR 
THIS STAGE OF THE TOURNAMENT FOUR 
CENTURY BREAKS 
IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO WALLOW TO SEE IF THE 
BREAK SO CARRY ON TOMORROW IT 
DIDN'T PUT THAT THERE WERE PROBLEMS 
WITH THE CUSHION ON THE OTHER TABLE 
THE HIGHEST BREAK 
IS QUITE LOW IT IT IS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO WHICH IS AFTER A WEEK'S 
PLAY A BIT LOW BUT MAYBE A FEW OF 
THEM HAVE BEEN PUSHING THE BOAT OUT 
TO MAKE THEIR ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BECAUSE THERE IS 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOR IT 
ALI CARTER HAS 
BEEN GETTING FURTHER TWO 
TOURNAMENTS AND AFTER THE WIN 
AGAINST BARRY HAWKINS IT MAY HAVE 
HELPED HIM OUT 
JOHN HIGGINS WAS 
SHOWING FRUSTRATION THIS AFTERNOON 
HE WAS FOUR TO ZERO UP AND SURRENDERED THE 
LEAD JOHN REACTED HE THINKS THERE 
IS TO WHICH SPRING IN THE CUSHIONS 
TOO MUCH SPRING WE HAVE AN E. 
MAIL FROM EMMA CRAVEN JOHN HIGGINS 
HAS BANNED THERE TABLE SHOULD HE 
BE REPRIMANDED BANGED 
IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT THE 
PUNISHMENT WOULD BE TO LOSE A 
FRAME WOULD BE HARSH 
THERE WERE 
THERE THEY JUST HAVE A QUIET WORD 
IN YOUR AREA AND TELLS YOU TO 
DOWN L. SAW THE KILLER DO IT ONCE 
MICHAELA 
THE THERE FOR THE 
DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK IT WAS A 
PROBLEM 
I DON'T THINK IT WILL PROBLEM CARRY ON HE WILL BE ALL RIGHT THE THE FASCINATING THING IS WATCHING A 
PLAYER UNDER PRESSURE 
THAT IS IT 
BUT NOT FOR LONG HAZEL IRVINE IS 
HERE AT SEVEN P. M. WHEN STEPHEN HENDRY AND 
DING JUNHUI RESUME THEIR SECOND 
ROUND MATCH
