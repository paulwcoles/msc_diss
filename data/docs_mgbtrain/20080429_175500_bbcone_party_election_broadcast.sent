I'LL BE BACK AT ONE THOUSAND P. M. ENJOY YOUR EVENING 
AND NOW A PARTY ELECTION BROADCAST 
BY THE LABOUR PARTY FOR THE LONDON 
ELECTIONS 
WHAT I FIND SO SPECIAL ABOUT LONDON 
MORE THAN ANY OTHER CITY IN THE 
WORLD IS THE PEOPLE 
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE 
THE WHOLE WORLD IS HERE 
IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT BRING THE 
DRIVE AND THE ENERGY 
IT IS JUST A PLACE WHERE ALMOST 
ANYTHING IS GOING ON AT ANY TIME OF 
THE DAY YOU HAVE EVER FAITH YOU 
HAVE PEOPLE FROM EVERY NATION 
LIVING HERE IT'S A REAL MONTH OLD 
FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT 
HOWEVER DIVERSE AND DIFFERENT 
NATIONS ARE THEY CAN LIVE SIDE BY 
SIDE AS LONG AS THEY RESPECT EACH 
OTHER OTHER IF YOU ASKED ME TO DEFINE MYSELF 
I'D SAY I'M A LONDONER 
LONDON IS EQUAL WITH NEW YORK AS AN 
ECONOMIC POWER PEOPLE ARE COMING 
IN AND OUT OF LONDON EVERYONE 
NEEDS TO BE HERE AND THEY'RE DOING 
ALL OF THEIR TRADING AND COMPETING 
WE HAVE MORE JAPANESE BANKS IN 
LONDON THAN YOU HAVE IN TOKYO 
TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THERE WAS NOT A 
SINGLE JOB ANYWHERE HERE NOW THERE 
IS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND CROSSRAIL OPENS YOU 
WILL HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
SIXTEEN BILLION 
WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT 
I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE REPUTATION 
LONDON HAS GOT NOT JUST THE 
CULTURAL IMPACT WE ARE HAVING BUT 
WE ARE LEADING THE WORLD ON CLIMATE 
CHANGE CHANGE WHAT IS REALLY REMARKABLE HERE IS 
THAT EVERYONE WILL BE GETTING OFF 
THE EUROSTAR OPPOSITE THE NICEST 
LITTLE WILDLIFE PARK ANYWHERE IN 
CENTRAL LONDON 
ALL RIGHT KEN 
HELLO HELLO ALL RIGHT 
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
YOU 
I'M ON MY WAY 
TO GET SOMETHING YOU TO EAT 
THIS MAN HAS CHANGED MY 
LIFE AS A DISABLED PERSON THE 
OTHER THING I LIKED ABOUT THE MAYOR 
YOU USE THE TRANSPORT YOURSELF 
HAVE A GOOD DAY BYE BYE EGGS SUNNY SIDE UP HAVE YOU GOT 
ANY MUSHROOMS THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE OLYMPICS 
IS THAT NO ONE EXPECTED US TO WIN 
LONDON LONDON WE'VE NOW STARTED ON THE SITE FOR 
THE STADIUM BEFORE THE GAMES IN 
BEIJING HAVE EVEN BEGUN IT IS THE 
BEST CHANCE THE EAST END HAS HAD 
FOR FORTY YEARS TO SHARE IN THE 
GENERAL PROSPERITY OF THE REST OF 
LONDON LONDON ONE OF OUR REAL PROBLEMS IS THE WAY 
THE HOUSING MARKET HAS GONE MAD 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN THE 
MAYOR'S OFFICE FOUR BILLION TO SPEND 
BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOMES IT'S A 
REAL CHANCE TO MAKE AN IMPACT ON 
HOMELESSNESS AND OVERCROWDING 
I BELIEVE WE HAVE TURNED THIS CITY 
AROUND FOR INSTANCE THERE IS MORE 
POLICE ON THE STREETS L. THINK 
THERE IS A REAL FEELING OF OPTIMISM 
LONDON'S IN A VERY STRONG POSITION 
BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE TOO 
MANY MISTAKES AND SUDDENLY LONDON 
WOULD BE IN A PRETTY CATASTROPHIC 
DECLINE DON'T STAND UP I'M ONLY 
THE MAYOR I'M NOT ROYALTY THIS 
HAS BECOME A REALLY SERIOUS AND 
IMPORTANT JOB YOU HAVE BUDGET OF 
ABOUT THIRTEEN BILLION NEXT YEAR TO 
SPEND YOU NEED TO GET IT RIGHT 
THEY DON'T MAKE HIM MAYOR I WILL 
GO MAD 
A QUESTION OF WHO IS MAYOR MAY EVEN 
BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHO WILL RUN 
THE GOVERNMENT SO MUCH THAT THE 
MAYOR DOES DIRECTLY IMPINGES ON 
YOUR DAILY LIFE YOU HAVE TO ASK 
CAN THEY RUN AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX 
MACHINE WITH ME EVERYBODY KNOWS 
WHAT THEY'RE GETTING IT'S ON THE 
TIN NO ONE CAN SAY AT THIS 
ELECTION IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO GETS 
IN IT WILL COMPLETELY DETERMINE 
WHAT SORT OF LONDON WE HAVE IN THE 
FUTURE
