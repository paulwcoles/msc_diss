THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE AND SOME SCENES WHICH SOME VIEWERS MAY FIND UPSETTING 
SIX YOUNG ATHLETES HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE OF A LIFETIME 
TO TRAVEL THE WORLD AND COMPETE AGAINST THE MOST REMOTE TRIBES ON EARTH 
ON THEIR OWN TERMS 
I AM REALLY BRICKING IT 
OH SHIT 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE'RE GOING 
ALL SIX MEN ARE MASTERS IN THEIR CHOSEN FIELDS 
COVERING THE HEAVY LIFTING BRAD BRINGS THE BRAWN 
YEAH I'M A STRONG MAN 
EVERY COMPETITION YOU ARE YOU'RE A ONE MAN ARMY 
OXFORD GRADUATE RICHARD IS ENGLISH GRIT 
ER I LOVE TO WIN I HATE LOSING 
JASON'S A CHAMPION B. M. X. SPRINTER WHO'S FOUGHT HIS WAY TO THE TOP 
YOU KNOW THEY GOT THE OLD PHRASE CAN'T BEAT 'EM JOIN 'EM I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IN THAT 
CAN'T BEAT 'EM YOU CHEAT 
MARK'S ALL TECHNIQUE 
A SALSA DANCER WITH A PUNCH 
I'M PRETTY GOOD AT EVERYTHING I DO 
COREY'S A HARVARD EDUCATED SCIENTIST 
I USE MY BRAIN BEFORE MY MUSCLE 
AND A TOP ENDURANCE ATHLETE 
CONQUER 
AND RAJKO'S A FITNESS GURU WITH A BODY HONED TO PERFECTION 
I WANT TO ACHIEVE MY OPTIMUM AS A PHYSICAL BEING 
OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS ALL SIX WILL BE PUT THROUGH HELL 
BUT WILL THEIR WESTERN SKILLS COUNT FOR ANYTHING I CAN'T BREATHE 
AS THEY'RE HURLED INTO A WORLD OF TRIBAL SPORT AND RITUAL 
UNLIKE ANYTHING THEY'VE EVER SEEN 
COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BE THE LAST MAN STANDING 
OUR ATHLETES ARE IN MONGOLIA ONE OF THE MOST BARREN LANDSCAPES IN THE WORLD 
HERE THERE'S NOTHING I HAVEN'T SEEN A SINGLE LIVING THING 
GETTING HERE MEANS HITCHING A CAMEL FOR SEVEN HOURS 
IT'S BOILING HOT IT'S ROCKY 
I MEAN IT'S IT'S KIND OF LIKE ANOTHER PLANET REALLY 
THEY'RE ON THE FOURTH LEG OF A CONTEST THAT'S TAKING THEM ACROSS THE GLOBE 
IN BRAZIL THEY TOOK ON KALAPALO WRESTLERS AND BIG LAD BRAD CAME OUT ON TOP 
THAT'S RIGHT I'M BRAD 
AGAINST ZULU STICK FIGHTERS BRUMMIE MARK UNLEASED HIS MARTIAL ARTS EXPERTISE TO SEIZE THE PRIZE 
AN AGONISING ENDURANCE RACE IN MEXICO SHREDDED OUR ATHLETES' FEET 
BUT RAJKO PUT MIND OVER MATTER AND BLISTERS TO CLAIM VICTORY 
ARGH 
IN INDIA JASON GRABBED HIS FIRST TITLE 
KICK FIGHTING HIS WAY TO THE TOP AGAINST THE HEADHUNTERS OF NAGALAND 
RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T KNOW IT BUT ON THE MONGOLIAN STEPPE 
OUR ATHLETES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GET TO GRIPS WITH THE HARSH REALITY OF NOMADIC LIFE 
I PROBABLY GOT ABOUT THREE HOURS SLEEP AND I FEEL ROUGH 
THEY'LL HAVE TO KILL FOR THEIR SUPPER 
AND DO A SPOT OF BALL BREAKING UGH 
GOING TO REACH IN GRAB A NUT AND YANK IT OUT 
TRAINING WILL BRING AGONY AND RAGE 
DON'T SPIT ON ME NO MORE 
BECAUSE THEY'VE JUST TEN DAYS 
TO PREPARE FOR A CONTEST THAT'S BARELY CHANGED SINCE THE DAYS OF GENGHIS KHAN 
MONGOLIAN WRESTLING 
AFTER A BUTTOCK BATTERING RIDE OUR ATHLETES ARRIVE AT A NOMAD SETTLEMENT IN NORTH WEST MONGOLIA 
FIRST TO MEET THEM IS GOAT HERDER GAMBOLT 
JASON AND RAJKO I CAN'T FEEL MY BUM AT ALL 
FOR THE NEXT TEN DAYS THEY'LL LIVE WITH THREE SEPARATE FAMILIES 
RAJKO AND JASON ARE MOVING IN GAMBOLT'S PLACE 
RAJKO 
RAJKO YEAH GAMBOLT 
GAMB 
SUNJIT

LONDON LONDON 
FLORIDA FLORIDA 
AMERICA FLORIDA FLORIDA 
BRAD AND RICHARD ARE BUNKING UP WITH HORSEMAN JAJA AND HIS FAMILY 
TASTES GOOD THERE'S NO OBLIGATION 
THERE'S NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD BE SO KIND TO US 
IF ANYTHING I'M AMAZED THEY DON'T FEEL RESENTFUL THAT WE'RE JUST 
BARGING IN THERE AND TAKING QUITE A LOT OF THEIR PRECIOUS SPACE 
COREY AND MARK ARE STAYING AT THE HOME OF A SUPERSTAR 
A LOCAL WRESTLING LEGEND SIMPLY CALLED STRONG 
WRESTLING THAT'S YOU 
OH IT'S GOOD I KNEW WE'D BE WRESTLING 
SIX 
SIX O'CLOCK SIX 
O. K. TRAINING BEGINS AT SIX 
SHIT WE'VE GOT TO BE UP EARLIER THAN SIX 
SIX O. K. 
YOU MAKE IT LOOK SO AGGRESSIVE IT'S STARTING TO SCARE ME 
JUST LOOK AROUND 
JUST ABSOLUTELY LOOK AROUND 
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE 
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE 
IT'S SIX A M. AND WRESTLING COACH STRONG HAS ALREADY STARTED TRAINING 
THE CAT THAT'S DOING THE TRAINING HIS NAME TRANSLATES INTO STRONG 
HE'S FIFTY YEARS OLD VERY ATHLETIC AGILE 
IN JUST TEN DAYS STRONG'S GOT TO GET THEM READY FOR THIS 
IT'S CALLED NAADAM THE BIGGEST SPORTING FESTIVAL OF THE YEAR 
ALL THE REGION'S TOP WRESTLERS WILL BE HERE AND THEY WON'T 
BE GOING EASY ON THE FOREIGNERS THE AIM IS TO THROW YOUR OPPONENT 
YOUR FEET AND HANDS CAN TOUCH THE GROUND BUT IF ANYTHING ELSE HITS THE DIRT YOU LOSE 
IF THAT SOUNDS SIMPLE REMEMBER THAT THE LOCAL LADS STARTED TRAINING AS SOON AS THEY COULD WALK 
STRONG WILL HAVE QUITE A JOB TURNING OUR ATHLETES INTO MONGOLIAN WRESTLERS 
ESPECIALLY WHEN BRAD THINKS HE'S HULK HOGAN 
TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD STRONG MAN BRAD IS THE ONLY MARRIED ATHLETE 
AND HE'S A FATHER SINCE MY LITTLE ONE HAS BEEN BORN I'VE DEFINITELY BECOME A DIFFERENT PERSON 
NOW ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS MAKE THE FAMILY PROUD 
OH YEAH HE'S MY ACTION HERO 
BRAD WAS KING WHEN OUR ATHLETES FIRST TRIED WRESTLING IN BRAZIL 
THAT'S RIGHT I'M BRAD 
BUT WHEN IT HASN'T BEEN ABOUT STRENGTH HE'S REALLY SUFFERED 
IN MONGOLIA THOUGH BRAD IS EXPECTING HIS AWESOME STRENGTH TO PROVIDE A SECOND WIN 
BUT WITH TECHNIQUE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS MIGHT NOT BE AS EASY AS HE THINKS 
I THINK WE NEED TO LEARN SOME OF THESE MOVES BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'LL GET SCREWED 
WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL GIVING IT ALL OUR ENERGY 
BUT ONCE SOMEONE GETS YOU IN POSITION YOU'RE FINISHED 
FITNESS GURU RAJKO IS THE MOST INSTINCTIVE ALL ROUND ATHLETE OF THE GROUP 
AS WELL AS AN IMPRESSIVE PHYSIQUE HE'S JUST AS PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH OF MIND 
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN WIN UNLESS YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN WIN 
SO IT ALL STARTS IN THE MIND AND THE MIND'S A POWERFUL THING 
IN MEXICO HIS MENTAL STRENGTH HELPED HIM OVERCOME SEARING PAIN 
TO EARN HIM HIS FIRST WIN IN THE ENDURANCE RACE 
HE HASN'T DONE BADLY AT FIGHTING EITHER JUST MISSING OUT IN EVERY OTHER EVENT SO FAR 
I CAME THAT CLOSE TO WINNING AND IT WAS FRUSTRATING COS IT WAS THAT CLOSE 
IF ANYONE'S GOING TO GIVE BRAD A RUN FOR HIS MONEY IN MONGOLIA IT'S RAJKO 
BUT ALREADY STRONG'S TRAINING REGIME IS BATTERING THE ATHLETES 
INCLUDING BRAD 
AFTER THE ADRENALINE WENT AWAY I REALISED MY FINGER STARTED HURTING 
AND I LOOKED AT IT AND I THINK I BROKE IT 
I SHOWED IT TO 
STRONG AND HE JUST WANTED TO PULL IT BACK INTO PLACE 
BUT BRAD'S NOT THE ONLY ONE STRUGGLING 
MARK'S TWISTED HIS NECK AND HAS TO SIT OUT THE REST OF THE TRAINING SESSION 
WHILST THE REST OF THEM GET A DIFFERENT KIND OF EARLY BATH 
IF THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS BAD IT'S ONLY BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THE NEW UNIFORMS 
WE PUT IT ON OH PURPLE MY FAVOURITE 
THANKS SO MUCH 
ON NOW 
OH I DID GET THE PINK PANTIES 
THEY PUT US IN THIS THIS FUNKY ASS 
I DON'T KNOW LITTLE SALSA BIKINI LOOKING THING 
IT'S RIDICULOUS 
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO I'M IN PINK PANTIES AND A TOPLESS SHIRT 
AND LET'S WRESTLE WITH A BUNCH OF DUDES 
I CAN'T GET MEAN IN THIS 
THE THING IS IT'S A REAL MANLY SPORT RIGHT 
AND IT IS A REALLY REALLY ROUGH SPORT 
AND THEN THEY DRESS LIKE THAT 
I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING 
THAT'S NICE THANK YOU THANKS A LOT 
I FEEL TWELVE AGAIN 
IT'S FLAMING PINK 
LOOKING SPLENDID IN THEIR NEW OUTFITS LIGHTWEIGHT RICHARD TAKES ON RAJKO 
YOU GOT ME 
WELL DONE RICH 
I DON'T THINK I'M A NATURAL WRESTLER 
ALTHOUGH TO BE HONEST I'M SECRETLY QUITE QUITE PLEASED 
WITH MYSELF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST GET THROWN ALL OVER THE PLACE AND I MANAGED TO 
YOU KNOW IF NOT TRIUMPH OVER ANYONE I MANAGED TO HOLD MY OWN 
RICHARD MAY BE HOLDING HIS OWN 
BUT JASON ISN'T 
SO STRONG DECIDES TO GIVE HIM A QUICK PICK ME UP 
COME ON MAN DON'T SPIT ON ME NO MORE 
STOP IT 
IT'S PISSING ME OFF 
THE WORST THING I HATE IN MY WHOLE LIFE IS SOMEONE SPITTING ON ME 
DUDE I ALMOST FREAKING FLIPPED MY WAD 
I ALMOST HAD TO WALK AWAY I WAS GETTING SO FUCKING PISSED OFF 
TREE SURGEON AND BIKE RACER JASON KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GET ANGRY 
MY DAD TAUGHT ME ALWAYS PHYSICAL IS LIKE LAST RESORT 
BUT I MEAN I AIN'T GOT NO PROBLEM GETTING PHYSICAL 
BUT IN BRAZIL JASON WAS FRANKLY A BIT USELESS AND HIS TEMPER'S NEVER BEEN FAR FROM BOILING OVER 
WHO THE FUCK KNOWS THE RULES AROUND HERE 
I WAS FUCKING PISSED LIKE I WANTED TO RIP SOMEBODY'S HEAD OFF 
BUT CELEBRATING HIS TWENTY FIRST BIRTHDAY IN MEXICO JASON DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO START GROWING UP 
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DO I REALLY WANT TO DO IN LIFE 
A NEWFOUND COMMITMENT IN NAGALAND SAW JASON TAKE ON ARCH RIVAL RAJKO IN A KICK FIGHTING FINAL 
AND WIN 
NOW STRAIGHT FROM A FIRST VICTORY JASON'S CONFIDENCE IS HIGH 
OUT ON THE MONGOLIAN WASTELAND JASON SQUARES UP TO RAJKO AGAIN 
RAJKO ENDED UP MAKING FUN OF ME ABOUT SOMETHING I WAS SAYING 
I TOOK IT A LITTLE HARSHLY AND WE STARTED WRESTLING AND IT GOT A LITTLE ROUGH 
AND I ENDED UP KNOCKING THE AIR OUT OF HIM PRETTY BAD 
IN MY VERY FINAL FIGHT JASON MANAGED TO TWIST ME AND THREW ME OVER 
BUT JUST TO REALLY PUT THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN HE CAME DOWN ON 
ON ME WITH ALL HIS WEIGHT RIGHT INTO MY CHEST LIKE RIGHT ABOUT HERE 
SO JASON 
GET READY TO EAT THE DIRT 
COS ALL'S I KNOW IS I'M GONNA BEAT YOUR ASS 
THIS IS ME RAJKO AGAIN 
I JUST CAN'T BEAT JASON 
I JUST CAN'T BEAT JASON NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I'VE BET HIM 
FOR SOME REASON I ALWAYS END UP ON MY KNEES 
SUCKING BOLLOCKS 
I DON'T KNOW WHY 
LET ME THINK THROUGH MY MIND DICTIONARY REAL QUICK 
OH THAT'S THE WORD 
HE'S MAGNIFICENT 
IT'S DAY TWO AND WITH ALL THE ATHLETES BACK ON THEIR FEET 
STRONG DECIDES TO TEST THEIR ENDURANCE 
WITH A LITTLE JOG THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS 
AND THEN SOME WEIGHTS 
STRONG CAME UP AND PRESENTED US EACH WITH A STONE TO LIFT AS PART OF THE TRAINING 
AND THESE STONES WERE TERRIFYINGLY BIG 
THE OTHERS ALL DID THEIR SETS OF TEN 
AND SO IT CAME DOWN TO ME AND I REALLY FELT FOR THE FIRST TIME A VERY INTENSE PRESSURE 
OXFORD SPORTSMAN RICHARD HAS A DEGREE IN THEOLOGY 
AND A LITTLE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY 
THIS IS WHERE I LIVE 
HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY CROQUET CLUB 
I'M GOING TO BE IN WAY OUTSIDE MY COMFORT ZONE 
AND SO FAR IT'S CERTAINLY GOT PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE 
IN BRAZIL THE LOCALS RIPPED HIS LEGS TO SHREDS 
WITH PIRANHA TEETH AND GOT A THANK YOU FOR THEIR TROUBLE 
I'VE LIVED MY LIFE IN A VERY SECURE WORLD 
BUT I'M VERY VERY KEEN TO SHOW FROM THE OUTSET THAT 
YOU KNOW I'M SOMEONE THAT CAN ROUGH IT WITH THE BEST OF THEM 
I JUST TOLD MYSELF YOU'VE GOT TO LIFT THIS 
YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT TEN TIMES NO MATTER IF IT FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BREAK YOUR BACK 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO GET THAT TENTH ONE OUT AND YOU KNOW GET IT SORT OF REGISTERED 
COME ON COME ON 
COME ON RICH COME ON 
SIX GOOD LAD SEVEN 
EIGHT 
COME ON SON NINE 
ONE MORE ONE MORE 
ONE MORE 
GOOD LAD 
AFTER A TOUGH MORNING OF TRAINING THE AFTERNOON IS DEVOTED TO CHORES 
BRAD AND RICHARD'S TRIBE DAD JAJA WANTS THEM TO SORT OUT LUNCH 
UNFORTUNATELY AT THE MOMENT LUNCH STILL HAS A PULSE 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT ISN'T VERY PRETTY 
THE SHEEP IS STILL ALIVE 
AS JAJA RIPS THE MAIN ARTERY FROM ITS BEATING HEART 
ARE YOU SERIOUS 
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE 
LET GO 
BACK UP 
IT'S DEAD 
GAME OVER 
IT DEFINITELY RATTLED ME A LITTLE BIT 
AND AND CERTAINLY WHEN 
HE DRAGGED THE LADLE THROUGH THE INSIDE OF HIS RIBCAGE 
AND THE NOISE THAT IT MADE 
ALONG WITH THE CONTINUING PULSE IN THE VEINS OF THE DEAD SHEEP 
IT WAS A GRIZZLY EXPERIENCE BUT ONE I'LL REMEMBER FOR A LONG TIME 
RICHARD AND I SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY 
I'M MORE OF A REALIST 
THE THING IS IT DIDN'T BOTHER ME AS MUCH AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD 
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT MYSELF 
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO LEARN 
BUT I GOT TO THINK IF YOU'VE GOT TO FEED YOUR FAMILY 
YOU'VE GOT TO DO WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO 
I WAS TELLING RICH YOU KNOW HE SEEMED KIND OF BOTHERED BY IT 
BUT FROM THE TIME WE GOT HERE WE GOT GIGGED UP WE GOT SOME LAMB 
SO IT DEFINITELY MAKES ME APPRECIATE MY FOOD A LOT MORE 
THAT I CONSISTENTLY INGEST 
I'M ALWAYS EATING I'M ALWAYS EATING MEAT 
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS STRONG'S TRAINING SESSIONS CONTINUE TO TEST THE ATHLETES 
EVEN MORE THAN THE HAUTE CUISINE 
MY FREAKING NECK HURTS MY ANKLES HURT MY KNEES HURT 
HIGH ALTITUDE NO FOOD 
JUST WOKEN UP TIRED 
AND WHEN THE ATHLETES AREN'T TRAINING THEY'RE WORKING 
I PROBABLY GOT ABOUT THREE HOURS' SLEEP AND I FEEL ROUGH 
TWO DAYS AFTER GETTING DUMPED IN TRAINING 
RAJKO'S STILL FIGHTING THROUGH THE PAIN 
BUT BIG MEN BRAD AND JASON ARE LOOKING GOOD 
I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR LOOKS IT'S ALL ABOUT WINNING 
NOTHING ELSE 
TODAY IS A REST DAY 
IT'S GONE NINE AND JASON AND RAJKO ARE SLEEPING LIKE DEAD SHEEP 
MARK AND COREY ARE GOING FOR A DRIVE WITH STRONG 
MEANWHILE RICHARD AND BRAD ARE ABOUT TO GET A COOKED BREAKFAST 
YEAH IT'S THE HEAD OF THAT SHEEP 
I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS TO BE MY BREAKFAST 
I THOUGHT IT WAS MORE YOU KNOW LUNCH OR MAYBE MAYBE DINNER 
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPICE UP YOUR BREAKFAST THIS IS A PERFECT WAY 
A GOOD RACK OF TEETH AND SOME TONGUE IN THERE 
SURPRISING 
HAVING FINALLY EMERGED FROM BED RAJKO AND JASON HEAD FOR THE BATHROOM 
WHO WOULD HAVE KNEW I TOOK A POO IN MY GOOLY OOH 
THIS WILL BE OUR FIRST TIME 
FIRST TIME TOGETHER 
THIS IS TOO GAY MAN I CAN'T SHIT NEXT TO YOU 
NOW LOOK SEE THAT BIG ROCK 
O. K. YEAH YOU SHIT ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROCK I'LL SHIT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROCK 
MAYBE WE'LL PUT ANOTHER ROCK ON TOP OF THAT 
NEED TO GET SOME GOOD WIPING ROCKS FIRST 
I PUT ONE ASS CHEEK ON THE SIDE OF THE ROCK AND I SIT DOWN 
AND THEN I TUCK MY WIENER BEHIND ME SO I DON'T PISS ON MY CLOTHES 
AND AFTER YOU'RE DONE 
YOU JUST TAKE A ROCK SEE THAT'S NOT THAT BAD 
DON'T WIPE WITH SOMETHING WITH A JAGGED EDGE COS IT DON'T FEEL GOOD 
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE ON A DOWNHILL BECAUSE IT COULD ROLL INTO YOUR SHOE AFTER YOU'VE RELEASED 
SO THIS IS TOO TOO MUCH OF A SLOPE HERE 
OH THIS IS OUTER MONGOLIA MAN YOU GOT TO TAKE A SHIT OUT ON ROCKS 
SO I GUESS IF PEOPLE WANT TO SEE ME TAKING A SHIT HERE I AM 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY MARK AND COREY ARE ABOUT TO FIND OUT WHERE STRONG'S TAKING THEM 
IT'S HERE A PRACTICE TOURNAMENT 
WHERE SOME OF THE LOCAL TOUGH GUYS HAVE COME TO WARM UP 
BEFORE THE NAADAM NOW JUST THREE DAYS AWAY 
YOU SEE HOW UPRIGHT THEY ARE AND YET THEY'RE STILL LOW DOWN 
LIKE THEY'RE STRAIGHT LEGGED BEND FROM THE WAIST 
SEE HOW QUICK THEY ARE 
YEAH 
COREY AND MARK ARE SUPPOSEDLY HERE TO STUDY THE MOVES 
BUT WHAT MARK DOESN'T KNOW IS THAT STRONG HAS COME UP WITH A SUDDEN BRIGHT IDEA 
I'M NOT EXPECTING TO WIN SO I'M JUST GOING TO GO OUT AND ENJOY THE EXPERIENCE 
I'M NOT GOING TO EXPERIENCE ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER AGAIN SO BOLLOCKS TO IT 
WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT 
TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD BRUMMIE MARK IS THE DARK HORSE OF THE GROUP 
IF THE OTHER LADS PERCEIVE ME 
AS AN UNDERDOG BRING IT ON I'M FULL OF SURPRISES 
HE HAS A PASSION FOR SALSA DANCING 
PEOPLE THINK I'M A LITTLE BIT OF A WOMANISER BUT NOT IN A BAD WAY 
I'M VERY POLITE I TREAT PEOPLE THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE TREATED 
UNLESS HE'S IN THE RING IN ONE ON ONE COMBAT 
I THINK I'LL BE THE FAVOURITE BECAUSE OF THE KICK BOXING 
SPEED CONTROLLED AGGRESSION WITH THE SALSA FOOTWORK AND BALANCE 
IT PROVED A PERFECT COMBINATION IN SOUTH AFRICA 
WHERE HE SCORED A VICTORY AT VICIOUS ZULU STICK FIGHTING 
I'M JUST SPEECHLESS ABSOLUTELY SPEECHLESS 
AND HE WAS FAVOURITE TO WIN AGAIN IN NAGALAND 
AGAINST KICK FIGHTING HEADHUNTERS UNTIL THIS 
I'VE REALLY SMASHED THE BACK OF THE HEEL AND NOW I'VE GOT 
EXCRUCIATING PAIN THROUGH THE WHOLE OF MY FOOT AND MY ANKLE 
SO CAN HE COME BACK FROM INJURY TO SHOW OFF HIS FIGHTING SKILLS ONCE MORE IN MONGOLIA 
SALSA HANDS 
AS IT TURNS OUT HIS DANCING SKILLS MIGHT BE QUITE HANDY AS WELL 
THIS IS THE TRADITIONAL MONGOLIAN EAGLE DANCE 
A CRUCIAL PART OF ALL PRE FIGHT BUILD UPS 
ENOUGH FLAPPING TIME TO WRESTLE 
TO EVERYONE'S SURPRISE INCLUDING HIS MARK WINS 
TIME TO CELEBRATE 
PRETEND TO BE AN EAGLE 
THE CEREMONIAL PORK PIE HAT 
AND A HANDFUL OF CHEESE 
WHICH AS TRADITION DEMANDS HE LOBS AT A GRATEFUL AUDIENCE 
I'M ABSOLUTELY ECSTATIC MY FIRST EVER FIGHT AND I WIN IT 
MAN THAT'S WHAT COMPETITION'S ABOUT 
THAT IS WHAT COMPETITION'S ABOUT 
I'M TRYING TO GET MY BREATH COS IT'S HARD BLOODY WORK 
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT THESE NEXT FEW DAYS IF THEY GO ON LIKE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PAY OFF 
I'VE GONE IN THERE ON MY FIRST FIGHT AND I'VE WON IT 
THANK YOU 
IN ONE EAGLE SWOOP MARK HAS TURNED PROFESSIONAL 
HIS UNDERSTANDING OF TECHNIQUE GIVES HIM A REAL CHANCE 
AGAINST THE BIG BOYS EARLY FAVOURITES BRAD AND JASON 
AND HE'S EARNED A CASH PRIZE TO BOOT THREE HUNDRED FORTY TUGRIK 
THAT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN P. 
WHEN WE FIGHT NOW TOMORROW WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT'S PROPERLY DONE 
DON'T GO HAMMER AND TONG 
COS THEY'LL KILL YOU 
YOU JUST WAIT JUST WAIT BE PATIENT 
FEEL A LOT BETTER SEEING THAT COS WE DEFINITELY HAD THE BEST TRAINER 
EVERYBODY THERE RESPECTS HIM LIKE HE'S A KING 
YEAH HE KNOWS EVERYBODY 
HE WAS PROBABLY BANGING IN HIS PRIME MAN 
IT'S ONLY TWO DAYS UNTIL NAADAM 
AND STRONG HAS DECIDED IT'S TIME TO STEP THINGS UP A NOTCH 
HE'S CALLED IN EX CHAMPION BAATAR TO SORT THEM OUT 
HIS NAME MEANS HERO 
HE'S LIKE ONE OF THEM LIKE WHEN YOU WATCH THE OLD SCHOOL KARATE FILMS 
THE BRUCE LEE FILMS AND YOU'VE GOT THE THE OPPONENT THE EVIL GUY MAN 
IT'S HIM HE'S GOT A GOOD FIGHTING FACE UNLIKE ME WHO HAS A VERY MILKY BAR KID FACE 
DOESN'T HELP AT ALL 
HE LOOKS OLD MAN HE LOOKS MEAN 
HERO IS FIFTY EIGHT YEARS OLD 
BUT HE'S NOT SHY ABOUT GETTING HIS KIT OFF 
AND BY GOD HE CAN EAGLE DANCE WITH THE BEST OF THEM 
I'M A TECHNIQUE ATHLETE NOT LIKE BRAD 
I'VE BEEN THROUGH COLLEGE SO I'VE GOT THE DISCIPLINE IF I WANTED TO LOOK LIKE HIM I WOULD 
TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD HARVARD INTELLECTUAL COREY LOVES NATURE 
I WAS BORN IN ALASKA AND AS A RESULT THE MOUNTAINS AND NATURE ARE MY HOME 
THAT'S WHAT I CONNECT TO AND THAT HAS MADE ME EVERYTHING THAT I AM TODAY 
UNFORTUNATELY TODAY HE'S A LOSER 
INJURED IN MEXICO BEATEN IN NAGALAND AND NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO FIGHT IN AFRICA 
I WAS ACTUALLY SCARED FOR MY OWN LIFE 
MORE WORRYINGLY THE LAST TIME HE WRESTLED IN BRAZIL THEY NEARLY BROKE HIS NECK 
IT JUST SEEMS UNNECESSARY 
NOW HE HAS ANOTHER CHANCE TO DO ALASKA PROUD 
I LOVE TECHNIQUE SPORTS AND THIS IS DEFINITELY A TECHNIQUE SPORT 
ORIGINALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ALL MUSCLE SPORT SO I GOT MILES MORE CONFIDENCE NOW DEFINITELY 
WITH HIS CONFIDENCE SKY HIGH 
COREY GETS TO TAKE ON A MAN ALMOST THREE TIMES HIS AGE 
HE LASTS FIVE SECONDS 
OH DEAR 
BUT STRONG'S REGIME ISN'T ENTIRELY GOING TO WASTE 
AS THE FIGHTING GOES ON THE GUYS ARE ALL LEARNING THAT MASTERING THE TECHNIQUE PAYS OFF 
HERO'S QUIETLY IMPRESSED WITH JASON AND MARK 
LESS SO WITH BRAD 
EVEN LITTLE RICHARD IS PERFECTING A FEW MOVES 
WHICH LEAVES BIG GUY RAJKO 
DESPERATE TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON HERO 
WELL DONE RAJKO OH FUCK 
IT'S THAT INJURY HE GOT AGAINST JASON 
I WAS HOPING TO REST TODAY BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO REST 
WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T SEE YOUR INJURY AND WHEN THE 
WHEN THE DUDE'S EGGING YOU ON 
YOU KNOW I HATE MAKING EXCUSES AS WELL 
NAADAM IS THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW 
AND IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR RAJKO 
MAN THE PRACTICE WE HAD TODAY WAS JUST MAGNIFICENT 
WE WERE LEARNING SOME FREAKING AWESOME HOLDS AWESOME TRIPS 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE THE LINGO FOR IT 
BUT ALL THE MOVES WE WERE DOING WERE PRETTY GOOD SMOOTH AS ICE 
RAJKO AGAIN COULD NOT HANDLE IT BECAUSE HIS SIDE WAS HURTING BOO HOO HOO 
THE ATHLETES HAVE BEEN LIVING AS NOMADS FOR A WEEK 
BUT THE MONOTONY OF LIFE HERE IS ALREADY TAKING ITS TOLL 
I SUPPOSE IT'S JUST BEEN A BIT LONG OF HAVING HOT MILK AND TEA AND LAMB 
WAKING UP IN THE MORNING HOT MILK TEA LAMB 
LUNCH HOT MILK BREAD HOT MILK BREAD HOT MILK BREAD 
GODDAMN I WANT SOME VEGETABLES 
A BIT MORE HOT MILK AND BREAD 
BREAD HOT MILK BIT OF LAMB HOT MILK BREAD 
BREAD HOT MILK BREAD BREAD 
BUT FOR RAJKO AND JASON GOAT HERDER GAMBOLT IS ABOUT TO BREAK THE MONOTONY 
THE NOMADS ENSURE THE QUALITY OF THEIR FLOCKS BY ONLY ALLOWING THE BEST RAMS TO BREED 
AND IF A YOUNG MALE DOESN'T MAKE THE GRADE THERE'S BAD NEWS IN STORE 
CHAPS LOOK AWAY NOW 
WHY AM I LAUGHING OH YOU FUCKER 
HE'S LOOKING YOU RIGHT IN THE EYE SAYING NO RAJKO LET ME GO 
OH MY GOD 
WHAT ARE WE DOING 
SHEEP BLEAT 
I'M JUST GOING TO REACH IN GRAB A NUT AND YANK IT OUT 
O. K. 
HOLD HIM 
I FEEL BAD FOR THIS SHEEP 
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS 
THERE YOU GO 
ARGH 
WHY YOU LAUGHING AT ME MAN THIS SHIT AIN'T FUNNY 
YOU ALL RIGHT YEAH I JUST FEEL A BIT WEIRD 
I DON'T KNOW WHY I THINK I DON'T LIKE 
CAUSING SUFFERING TO ANYTHING 
I HEAR YOU 
JUST LIKE RIPPING OUT THE TESTICLES OF AN ANIMAL DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT 
AND I KIND OF FELT SICK AND I EVEN FELT A LITTLE BIT EMOTIONAL 
AND I OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T WANT TO SHOW IT 
BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MISINTERPRETED BY ESPECIALLY THE LOCAL GUYS 
AND IT STRANGELY ENOUGH MADE ME EVEN QUESTION 
WHETHER I WANTED TO EAT MEAT 
BUT NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO CONSIDER GOING VEGETARIAN 
BECAUSE TONIGHT GAMBOLT'S FAMILY ARE ENJOYING A MONGOLIAN DELICACY 
TESTICLE SOUP 
COME ON JUST EAT IT 
IF YOU EAT IT I'LL EAT IT 
WE'LL BOTH STICK A BIG FAT TESTICLE IN OUR MOUTH AT THE SAME TIME 
NO 
IF IT WAS LIFE AND DEATH I'D EAT IT BUT IT'S NOT SO 
NO SORRY 
I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE ACTUALLY PISSED HIM OFF 
I CAN'T 
BY REFUSING THIS LOCAL DELICACY BOTH GUYS OFFEND THEIR HOST 
NAADAM IS JUST A DAY AWAY 
AND STRONG HAS CALLED OUR ATHLETES TOGETHER FOR ONE LAST TIME 
THERE'S NO MORE TIME TO LEARN 
AND ALL STRONG CAN HOPE IS THAT THEY LISTEN TO HIS LAST WORDS OF ADVICE 
THE GUY WHO'S TRAINING US IS REAL YOU KNOW SERIOUS 
AND HE TAKES A LOT OF PRIDE IN US SO I WANT TO SHOW THAT BACK TO HIM 
SO NOW WHEN I WEAR THIS COSTUME EVEN THOUGH I MIGHT LOOK FUNNY IN AMERICA I'M A BAD ASS IN MONGOLIA 
WE HAVE TAKEN IT VERY VERY SERIOUSLY 
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF NO ONE GOT PAST AT LEAST THE THIRD OR FOURTH ROUND 
BECAUSE IT WOULD UNDERMINE THE HARD WORK THAT'S BEEN PUT IN OVER THE LAST WEEK 
BUT ONE ATHLETE MIGHT NOT MAKE THE TOURNAMENT AT ALL 
OUR TRAINER STRONG HE COMPLETELY DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT I WAS INJURED 
AND HE WAS SAYING OH STOP CRYING 
IT WAS REALLY ANNOYING AND I STARTED THINKING AM I BEING A WIMP HERE 
MAYBE IT ISN'T EVEN SERIOUS AND I'M JUST MAKING A BIG DEAL 
AND THAT'S IT TRAINING'S OVER 
THE NEXT TIME THEY FIGHT IT'LL BE FOR REAL 
IT'S THE DAY OF NAADAM 
THIS TOURNAMENT HAS BARELY CHANGED SINCE GENGHIS KHAN'S TIME 
AND THE LOCALS TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY 
IT'S A KNOCK OUT COMPETITION 
OUR ATHLETES COULD BE DRAWN AGAINST EACH OTHER OR A PAST CHAMPION 
COREY AND RICHARD HAVE STILL TO WIN AN EVENT 
WHILE FOR RAJKO BRAD MARK AND JASON VICTORY HERE WOULD GIVE AN OUTRIGHT LEAD 
WINNING IS THE BEST FEELING ANYONE WILL EVER EXPERIENCE 
UNFORTUNATELY MOST PEOPLE DON'T EXPERIENCE WINNING 
I'M A STRONG MAN WHATEVER LIES BEFORE US WE HANDLE IT MAN UP WE ENDURE PAIN' 
WHEN IT COMES TO SINK OR SWIM 
I AIN'T THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT'S GONNA SINK IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING 
BATTLE COMMENCES AS RICHARD IS SENT INTO THE ARENA 
TEN DAYS' TRAINING AGAINST A GUY WHO'S DONE THIS ALL HIS LIFE 
WHEN YOU'RE MADE TO FIGHT ONE ON ONE WITH A GUY IN FRONT OF MAYBE THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE IT'S GOT TO BE DAUNTING 
HOLD ONTO HIM THAT'S IT THAT'S IT 
THERE YOU GO 
ONE ATHLETE IN AND ONE DOWN 
IT'S JUST A BIT GUTTING THAT I DIDN'T GET ANY FURTHER 
YOU KNOW IT'S A BIG EXCITING DAY AND TO HAVE IT ALL DONE THAT QUICKLY IT'S A BIT OF A KICK IN THE TEETH 
NEXT IT'S RAJKO'S TURN 
HE'S GOING TO NEED ALL HIS MENTAL STRENGTH TO OVERCOME THE INJURY THAT'S DOGGED HIM THE WHOLE WEEK 
I'M GOING TO GIVE IT A GO BUT I HAVE TO BE REALLY WARM 
IF I'M SWEATING WHEN I GO IN I THINK I'LL BE O. K. 
BUT IF IT HURTS I'LL WALK OUT 
AT THE MOMENT RAJKO THINKS HIS INJURY MIGHT JUST BE BRUISING 
HE'LL LATER DISCOVER IT'S ACTUALLY TWO BROKEN RIBS 
THE SLIGHTEST PRESSURE ON HIS RIGHT SIDE WILL BE AGONY 
AND SADLY HIS OPPONENT ONE OF THE TOURNAMENT FAVOURITES KNOWS IT 
I WAS ANXIOUS AS I WENT OUT THERE 
AND I THINK I EVEN WALKED OUT THERE KIND OF HOLDING MY RIBS 
AND HE KNEW I WAS INJURED 
AND I COULD TELL HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO HURTING ME 
OH COME ON COME ON COME ON 
THAT IS SOME SERIOUS PAIN 
I'M JUST FRUSTRATED THAT'S IT 
ANGRY WITH BEING INJURED 
AND FRUSTRATED AT KNOWING I COULD DO MUCH BETTER 
TIME FOR COREY TO FIGHT 
AND AS USUAL HE'S NOT EXACTLY SHORT OF CONFIDENCE 
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIGHTING SEVENTY PER CENT AND FIGHTING ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
AND I HAVEN'T FOUGHT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT YET BECAUSE THERE'S NO POINT IN HURTING MY FRIENDS' 
PAY ATTENTION YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE WHAT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT LOOKS LIKE 
COME ON BABY MAKE YOUR MOVE 
NO STAY THERE STAY THERE 
SHIT 
WITH THREE DEFEATS IN A ROW 
THIS IS THE WORST OUR ATHLETES HAVE DONE IN ANY LOCATION SO FAR 
I WENT FOR MY MOVE TOO SOON 
I SHOULD HAVE WAITED TILL I GOT A LITTLE MORE DESPERATE AND THEN GONE FOR IT AND GOT MYSELF OFF BALANCE 
HE KNEW I WAS GOING TO GO FOR IT COS HE KEPT PUTTING HIS KNEES OUT THERE 
HOPING I WOULD DO IT COS I THINK HE WAS GETTING TIRED OF HIS ARMS BEING PULLED ON 
SO BUT 
FRUSTRATING 
HE DIDN'T DESERVE TO WIN THAT ONE NO 
BUT HAVING WON A FIGHT AT THE PRACTICE COMPETITION THERE ARE HIGH HOPES FOR MARK 
I THINK MARK'S GOING TO GET IT MARK'S SEEN A FEW FIGHTS HE KNOWS HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING DOWN 
SAW HOW RICH WENT DOWN SAW HOW I WENT DOWN HE'S JUST GOT TO WAIT 
WAIT LONGER THAN HE THINKS HE NEEDS TO WAIT 
TAKE YOUR TIME BUDDY TAKE YOUR TIME YOU GOT ALL DAY 
DAMN IT 
HE HAD THAT 
I CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT 
THAT WAS SHIT I'M NOT EVEN OUT OF BREATH 
SHIT 
SHIT 
IT'S ONLY THE FIRST ROUND AND ALL STRONG'S WORK IS UNRAVELLING 
BUT NOW THE BIG MAN STEPS UP 
EVERYBODY'S OUT SO FAR SO IT'S LEFT ON ME 
I THINK THEY THINK IT'S A JOKE THAT WE CAME IN HERE 
AND THOUGHT WE COULD DO SOMETHING SO I GOTTA SHOW 'EM WE CAN 
AND I GOT ELDERS WALKING UP TO ME TELLING ME THEY GOT THEIR MONEY ON ME 
THAT MEANS A LOT 
BRAD PSYCHES HIMSELF UP 
AS STRONG MAKES A FEW LAST MINUTE ADJUSTMENTS TO HIS OUTFIT 
GO ON BRAD 
THEY NEEDN'T HAVE WORRIED 
MY FIRST FIGHT I WAS GOING AGAINST A TWELVE YEAR OLD 
WELL HE WAS AT LEAST SIXTEEN BUT HE LOOKED LIKE A TWELVE YEAR OLD 
SO I DON'T EVEN REALLY CONSIDER THAT A MATCH 
A SLIGHT MISMATCH PERHAPS 
BRAD'S EASILY THROUGH 
SO EASILY IN FACT THAT THE JUDGES PUT HIM STRAIGHT INTO HIS SECOND ROUND FIGHT 
THIS TIME AGAINST SOME MORE SERIOUS COMPETITION 
BRAD BRAD BRAD 
THE GUY I WON AGAINST NEXT MY SECOND ROUND IS THE SAME CAT WHO BEAT COREY 
SO YOU KNOW THIS CAT IS SERIOUS 
KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE HIS BUSINESS MAN UP LET'S DO SOMETHING 
OUR ATHLETES CELEBRATE BRAD'S SECOND VICTORY 
BUT BRAD'S OPPONENT BEGS TO DIFFER 
HE CLAIMS BRAD HIT THE DIRT FIRST NO NO NO NO NO 
NO NO 
THAT'S SHOCKING WHAT'S THE RULE 
HIS KNEE WENT DOWN 
FORTUNATELY MARK'S NOT THE ONLY ONE 
WHO SAW THE OPPONENT'S KNEE GO DOWN FIRST 
AND AFTER A BIT OF DEBATE THE JUDGES GIVE IT TO OUR MAN FROM OKLAHOMA 
WHO CELEBRATES WITH A BIT OF FLAPPING 
LAST LITTLE CAT WAS GOOD HE WAS QUICK 
FOR A SECOND I THOUGHT HE HAD ME BECAUSE I KNOW HE WENT DOWN FIRST 
BUT THE WAY HE ACTED HE THOUGHT HE TOOK IT GOT A LITTLE PARANOID 
NOW THE PRESSURE'S ON JASON 
IF HE DOESN'T BEAT HIS OPPONENT BRAD WILL HAVE WON THE ATHLETES' COMPETITION 
NOBODY SCARES ME AND I DON'T EVER ENTER THE RING KNOWING I'M GOING TO GET BEAT 
I ALWAYS ENTER IT THINKING I'M GOING TO WIN EVERY TIME 
PINK PANTIES ALL THE WAY WHOO 
COME ON JAY IT'S YOU FLYING THE FLAG NOW MATE 
AFTER FIFTEEN EXTRAORDINARY MINUTES 
JASON'S EPIC BOUT IS STILL GOING ON 
JASON'S GOING TO GET THROUGH ON THIS ONE YEAH HE'S GOING TO WIN 
YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME ALL DAY LONG 
YANK ON IT DEATH GRIP 
FUCK 
HE'S DOWN 
THE FIFTH OF THE SIX ATHLETES TO GO OUT WITHOUT A WIN 
FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT I GUESS 
I'M NOT HAPPY 
I'M ANGRY 
AND DISAPPOINTED 
WHATEVER THEY TOOK ME OUT MAN 
AIN'T NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT THAT 
WITH TWO WINS TO HIS NAME BRAD IS THE LAST MAN STANDING 
BUT THE DAY ISN'T OVER YET 
THERE WAS NO DOUBT TO ME THAT I WAS GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY 
AND I WON AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I EXPECTED TO DO 
THE ATHLETES' COMPETITION IS IN THE BAG 
BUT IF BRAD WINS HIS NEXT ROUND 
HE BECOMES AN OFFICIALLY RANKED MONGOLIAN WRESTLER 
AND GAINS THE RATHER EXCELLENT TITLE OF ELEPHANT 
IT'S GOING TO BE BASICALLY THE LUCK OF THE DRAW BUT IT DOESN'T COME DOWN TO THAT 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO I GET MATCHED UP AGAINST I'M GOING TO END UP TAKING HIM 
WORRYINGLY HIS QUARTERFINAL DRAW IS AGAINST THE TOURNAMENT FAVOURITE 
BUT AT LEAST NOW BRAD HAS THE BENEFIT OF HIS OWN TEAM OF SUPPORTERS 
BRAD GO ON BRAD 
PATIENCE PATIENCE 
AS IT TURNS OUT BRAD'S LOST TO THE EVENTUAL OVERALL WINNER 
SO NO SHAME THERE 
AND BRAD HAS SAVED THE DAY FOR THE ATHLETES AND THEIR COACH STRONG 
ALL OF US HAVE COME HERE AND PUT OURSELVES THROUGH HELL BASICALLY 
TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THIS COMPETITION 
I HAD SOMETHING TO PROVE NOT ONLY TO MYSELF BUT I HAD SOMETHING TO PROVE TO THE TRAINER 
BRAD IS THE LAST MAN STANDING 
NEXT TIME ON LAST MAN STANDING 
I'VE NEVER BEEN TOUCHED SO MUCH IN MY LIFE 
OUR ATHLETES TRAVEL TO A TROPICAL PARADISE FOR AN UNUSUAL GAME OF CRICKET 
THIS IS BATTLE THIS IS WAR 
THE NOISE THAT PIG MADE 
BLOOD CURLING 
IT'S REALLY WEIRD MAN THIS PLACE IS WEIRD 
JUST SEEMED LIKE A BAD SCENE OUT OF A BLAIR WITCH PROJECT 
I'M TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT MAGIC I JUST WANT TO FREAKING GO HOME 
IT MIGHT BE THAT I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE 
WE'RE IN POMPEII AND IT'S VOLCANO DAY 
YOU SAVE PEOPLE NOT THIS TIME 
SHOW YOURSELF I MUST MAKE THE MOST TERRIBLE CHOICE 
DONNA DOCTOR
