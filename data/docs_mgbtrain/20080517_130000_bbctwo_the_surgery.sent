I HAVE LOADS OF GUY MATES 
I WOULD NEVER DREAM OF DOING ANYTHING WITH THEM THEY'RE LIKE MY BROTHERS 
NO THEY AIN'T 
GO AHEAD 
NO THEY'RE NOT HER BEST GUY MATE ARE YOU NOT GOING OUT WITH HIM NOW 
HELLO AND WELCOME I'M JEFF LEACH AND THIS IS SURGERY 
THE SHOW THAT KNOWS WHO ITS FRIENDS ARE 
SIT YOURSELVES DOWN RELAX 
SO TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FRIENDSHIPS 
AND ASKING THAT AGE OLD QUESTION 
CAN GUYS AND GIRLS EVER REALLY JUST BE FRIENDS 
OR AT SOME POINT DOES SEX ALWAYS COME INTO IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YES NO 
MIXED VIEWS THERE 
SO GUYS AND GIRLS JUST FRIENDS 
IS IT ACTUALLY POSSIBLE 
I SENT OUT OUR AFRO DIZZY DOUBLE ACT TO KISS THE UNCERTAINTY GOOD BYE 
HI I'M POPPY AND I'M KAT 
WE'RE IN TWO MINDS AS TO WHETHER GIRLS AND GUYS CAN BE FRIENDS 
I THINK THEY CAN HAVE A PLATONIC RELATIONSHIP 
WITHOUT FANCYING EACH OTHER 
I HAVE LOADS OF GUY FRIENDS AND THERE'S NO HIDDEN AGENDA 
MAYBE BUT CALL ME A CYNIC I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO MAINTAIN 
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ONCE ONE PERSON HAS FALLEN FOR THE OTHER 
HERE'S WHAT YOU THOUGHT 
CAN GUYS AND GIRLS BE MATES 
YEP IF YOU SHARE THE SAME INTERESTS AND THAT AND NOT FANCY EACH OTHER 
YOU CAN BE AS GOOD FRIENDS WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX 
NO MAYBE NO WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
NO END OF 
WHY NOT TEMPTATION OBVIOUSLY IT'S SEX 
IT'S EASIER TO GET ALONG WITH GUYS THAN IT IS TO GET ALONG WITH GIRLS 
EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T FANCY EACH OTHER 
SOMEWHAT YOU'D WANT TO IMPRESS THEM 
I HAVE A LOT OF BOY FRIENDS 
BOYS THAT ARE FRIENDS YEAH I KNOW 
NOT TO BE SHALLOW BUT IF A GIRL ISN'T PARTICULARLY GOOD LOOKING 
THEN YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ALL RIGHT I DON'T WANT TO KNOW HER 
JUST COS SHE'S NOT ATTRACTIVE TO YOU 
I LIKE FLIRTING HAVING A BIT OF FUN 
DO YOU RECKON YOU FLIRT 
EVEN IN PURELY PLATONIC LIKE FRIENDSHIPS WITH GIRLS 
I THINK MOST GUYS WANNA KNOW THAT GIRLS LIKE THEM 
EVEN IF THEY DON'T LIKE THEM 
THEY WANT TO FLIRT WITH THEM TO GET THEM TO LIKE THEM 
JUST SO THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SAY SHE LIKES ME 
SO HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN A FRIENDSHIP 
AND THEN REALISED THAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY FALLING FOR HIM 
YEAH 
WELL I DIDN'T WANT TO RUIN THE FRIENDSHIP 
A FRIEND TOLD HIM THAT I LIKED HIM AND THEN HE STOPPED TALKING TO ME 
OH NO 
THERE'S THE GOOD OLD ONE WHERE YOU FANCY SOMEONE 
YOU START OFF BEING FRIENDS BUT IT ALWAYS BLOSSOMS INTO SOMETHING MORE 
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT THAT'S WHEN IT GETS MORE DIFFICULT 
OR YOU GET TOTALLY DENIED 
SO WHAT DO WE RECKON GUYS AND GIRLS 
CAN PEOPLE EVER BE FRIENDS WITHOUT IT GOING FURTHER 
WHAT DO YOU THINK LAURA NO WAY DEFINITELY 
I DON'T THINK THEY CAN HAVE A PLATONIC RELATIONSHIP 
WITHOUT ONE GETTING FEELINGS FOR THE OTHER 
OR ONE OF THEM WANTING MORE FROM THE RELATIONSHIP 
SO IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO JUST BE FRIENDS 
NO NO YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT 
NO ARE YOU AGREEING 
NO OF COURSE I AGREE 
THERE'S ALWAYS A BOY IS ALWAYS ATTRACTED TO A GIRL 
THEY DON'T JUST START TALKING TO A GIRL THEY DON'T LIKE 
CARRY ON EXPLAIN THAT 
IF THEY DO IT'S COS THEY ARE ATTRACTED 
IF NOT BY LOOKS THEN PERSONALITY 
YOU LIKE THE SAME THINGS SO YOU START TALKING YOU'RE ATTRACTED 
WAIT I'M TALKING 
WAIT HE'S TALKING 
OOH 
BETTER LET HIM FINISH NOW GO AHEAD 
YOU ARE ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER WHETHER IT BE PERSONALITY OR LOOKS 
AND YOU START TALKING THEN THE BOY DOESN'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS 
HE'S JUST BEING FRIENDS SO YOU'LL PROGRESS TO BECOME A GIRLFRIEND 
SO YOU THINK IT'S JUST THE START OF SOME SORT OF SEXUAL THING 
START YEAH 
YOU DON'T AGREE 
NO I DON'T AGREE AT ALL WHAT DO YOU THINK SHEILA 
I THINK THAT YOU CAN JUST BE FRIENDS 
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE A BOY OR A GIRL 
HAVE YOU GOT PLENTY OF FRIENDSHIPS WITH GUYS YEAH I DO 
AND IT'S PLATONIC 
YEAH I WOULD NEVER DREAM OF DOING ANYTHING WITH THEM 
THEY'RE LIKE BROTHERS 
NO THEY'RE NOT 
GO AHEAD 
NO THEY'RE NOT HER BEST GUY MATE ARE YOU NOT GOING OUT WITH HIM NOW 
NO 
OOH BEEN DROPPED IN IT DROPPED IN IT 
IS THAT RIGHT CAN I SAY SOMETHING 
OF COURSE MY SWEET 
I WHATEVER I STARTED 
WE'VE GOT A GOOD POINT WELL MADE 
LISTEN TO ME I'LL ARGUE MY POINT 
I STARTED GOING OUT WITH HIM 
IT'S ONE GUY PEOPLE DO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS 
EVERY OTHER GUY THAT I'M MATES WITH I'D NEVER DREAM OF IT 
O. K. SO THAT WAS JUST A ONE OFF CASE 
BUT YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT THAT AT THE BEGINNING 
YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT OH I'LL NEVER GO OUT WITH ANY OF THEM 
NO THERE WAS AN ATTRACTION 
IF IT HAPPENED ONCE IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN 
LET ME COME OVER TO YOU MY FRIENDS 
LET ME JUMP IN HERE 
IT DEPENDS ON THAT PERSON'S PERSONALITY 
BECAUSE I FOR ONE DON'T LOOK AT LOOKS 
BUT 
YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM 
SO I WOULD BE ATTRACTED BY HER PERSONALITY 
AND THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH SINCE CHILDHOOD I LIKE 
AWWWWWW 
DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT HE'S SAYING 
HE'S GOT A POINT BUT I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE PERSON 
IF YOU HAVE A CHILDHOOD FRIEND A GIRL 
IF I GOT ATTRACTED TO HER I'D FEEL A BIT WEIRD 
SORRY BUT GIRLS DO HAVE FEELINGS AS WELL 
AND GIRLS DO ALSO WANT THINGS AS WELL 
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING 
NO EXCUSE ME WHAT IS AN AREA THAT 
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY THAT BOYS ALWAYS WANT SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE 
FEMALES AS WELL DO HAVE SENSES 
THEY HAVE DESIRES 
THEY HAVE WANTS AND NEEDS LET ME COME OVER TO THIS SIDE 
LADY WITH HER HAND UP 
WELL I WAS GONNA SAY 
I THINK THAT WHAT EVERYONE ELSE HAS BEEN SAYING IS A BIT RUBBISH 
COS YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE FRIENDS INNIT 
ME AND MY BEST FRIEND WE WENT TO THE SAME SCHOOL 
WE AREN'T SEXUALLY ATTRACTED 
HAVE YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND AS WELL 
YEAH HE'S NEXT TO ME 
WHICH ONE THAT'S MY BOYFRIEND 
SO THIS IS THEM BOTH 
AND WE'RE JUST FRIENDS WE'VE GOT THE SAME INTERESTS 
WE LIKE THE SAME THINGS BUT THERE'S NO SEXUAL 
YOUR TRAINERS ARE DIFFERENT YOU'RE LYING 
LIES NO NO NO WE BOTH 
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ARE YOU TWO FRIENDS 
THAT'S MY BEST MATE YOU TWO WERE BOYS BEFORE NO NO 
WE WERE FRIENDS FIRST NOT EVEN THAT 
I KNEW HER BEFORE THEY GOT TOGETHER 
IS HE JEALOUS OF YOU TWO BEING SO CLOSE ARE YOU 
NO NO NOT AT ALL 
NO PROBLEMS I TRUST THEM 
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN I DO WISH SHE'D COME TO ME WITH SOME PROBLEMS 
RELATIONSHIP ISSUES BUT APART FROM THAT I DON'T MIND 
SO SHE GOES TO HIM WITH PROBLEMS RATHER THAN TO YOU 
YEAH SOME RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS 
AND HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE SHE DOESN'T TRUST YOU 
IT DOES ANNOY ME SOMETIMES BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY 
A LOVE TRIANGLE 
GO AHEAD GO AHEAD 
SO COMING OVER TO YOU HANG ON A SECOND GUYS WAIT ONE SECOND

GOOD FOR YOU BUT IF A GUY

MAYBE NOT FOR YOU BUT FOR GUYS IT'S WORSE 
I'M NOT GETTING INVOLVED IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP 
BUT IT'S SO OBVIOUS I SEE YOU LOOKING AT HER 
HE'S CHECKING HER OUT 
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU'VE SAT NEXT TO ME YOU'VE SEEN ME 
IT'S THE BODY LANGUAGE AND YOU'VE SEEN ME 
GUYS ALL RIGHT GUYS HANG ON A SEC 
HOW DOES THEIR FRIENDSHIP MAKE YOU FEEL 
DO YOU TRUST HER IMPLICITLY WITH NATHAN

WHAT SO YOU CAN HONESTLY SAY 
THAT YOU'VE NEVER FELT SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO YOUR MATE NOTHING 
NEVER EVER 
HANG ON A SEC

GO AHEAD 
YOU TWO CAN BE FRIENDS LIKE AND SHARE STUFF WITH EACH OTHER 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S GOT TO GO TO A CERTAIN LEVEL 
COS THIS IS MY GOOD GIRL FRIEND HERE BUT STILL 
LET'S CLARIFY FRIENDS YEAH 
YEAH I'VE A GIRLFRIEND WHICH I LOVE 
OH WHAT ARE YOU LIKE YOU JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT ON T. V. 
WAIT HE'S SAID IT ON T. V. 
LET ME EXPLAIN MYSELF 
YOU'RE ALWAYS DOING THAT 
NAH LISTEN SHE HAS BOYFRIENDS YEAH 
AND SHE CAN TALK TO THEM 
BUT SHE HAS TO COME TO ME FIRST ABOUT THE PROBLEMS NO NO NO 
YEAH YEAH 
HE GETS UPSET WHEN SHE GOES TO HIS BOY FRIENDS 
SAME WAY SHE DOESN'T KNOW I'M EVEN HERE WITH HIM 
REVELATION 
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID THAT'S WHAT HE SAID 
ALL RIGHT HANG ON A SEC 
GO AHEAD 
MY GIRLFRIEND DOES KNOW SHE'S HERE REALLY LIES SHE DOES NOW LIES 
SHE DOES YEAH ALSO I ADMIT 
IT SHOULDN'T GO ON LIKE THAT IT SHOULDN'T 
IT SHOULDN'T DO YOU HAVE FEELINGS THEN 
NO SHE'S MY FRIEND MAN I LOVE HER LIKE MY SISTER 
BUT YOU SAID IT HAS TO GO TO A CERTAIN LEVEL LIKE IN THIS CASE 
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEY'RE POSSIBLY NOT JUST FRIENDS ARE YOU THE SAME 
YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER INNIT I UNDERSTAND 
BUT I'VE GOT TO SHOW MY GIRLFRIEND 
MORE AFFECTION THAN I SHOW MY FRIEND 
BUT ARE YOU DO YOU FEEL SHE SHOWS YOU MORE AFFECTION 
BUT STILL YEAH YOU'VE GOTTA TELL HIM STUFF OR HE'LL FEEL LEFT OUT 
LET'S ASK THE REASON WHY DO TELL NATHAN CERTAIN THINGS 
THAT YOU FEEL YOU CAN'T TALK TO YOUR BOYFRIEND ABOUT 
COS THERE'S CERTAIN PROBLEMS THAT I DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER I'M BEING PARANOID OR WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY A PROBLEM 
NATHAN WILL HIGHLIGHT IT TO ME FROM A MALE PERSPECTIVE 
TELL ME WHETHER I'M EXAGGERATING OR WHETHER IT IS ACTUALLY A PROBLEM 
COS OFTEN HE'LL SAY NO HE DOESN'T THINK THAT 
HE'S JUST CHILLING BACK PLAYING PLAYSTATION 
AND YOU ARE STRESSING OUT HERE FOR NOTHING 
YOU KNOW WHERE'S ALEX 
ALL RIGHT ALEX ALL RIGHT 
HOW'RE YOU DOING I'M O. K. THANKS 
YOU LIKE SNOGGING MATES DON'T YOU 
A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT 
WHO'RE THE MATES YOU SNOGGED 
BOTH OF THEM 
IT'S NOT NASTY HOW IS THAT NASTY 
HANG ON CHILL OUT 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT IF THEY'RE BOTH CONSENTING 
ALEXANDER HANG ON A SECOND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
BUT THESE TWO BOYS YEAH 
THEY GO TO MY COLLEGE RIGHT 
AND YOU'RE ALL MATES YEAH WE'RE ALL PART OF THE SAME GROUP OF MATES 
IT'S NOT A LOVE TRIANGLE 
THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIPS 
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS 
WHEN YOU GO OUT YOU HAVE A SNOG 
THAT IS IT 
HANG ON A SEC GUYS LET'S HEAR HER OUT 
THAT'S IT YEAH SAM IS MY BEST FRIEND 
SO IS LEE I CAN TELL SAM ANYTHING HE'S GOT A GIRLFRIEND NOW 
BUT SO YOU DON'T SNOG ANYMORE NO NOT ANY MORE 
IF IT'S A FRIENDSHIP YOU SHOULDN'T GO TO 
THERE'S BASICALLY A STOP POINT WHERE IT'S LIKE NO O. K. WHY 
WHO SETS THAT LINE 
NO GOOD QUESTION WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT 
I THINK IF YOU LIKE SOMEONE GO FOR IT 
IF YOU DON'T NO 
YOU AGREE I 
NO GO AHEAD WHY 
RIGHT O. K. IF YOU SEE A GIRL YOU SEE A BOY DOWN THE STREET 
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE FRIENDS YOU WOULDN'T IF THEY'RE UGLY 
AND THEN YOU SEE IF YOU'VE GOT A CONNECTION 
THEN YEAH YOU MIGHT BECOME BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND IF NOT 
THEN YOU'RE GONNA BE FRIENDS 
WELL WE'VE GOT LOTS OF DIFFERENT IDEAS LOTS OF DIFFERENT THOUGHTS 
HANG ON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
SO WHETHER YOU STARTED OFF AS MATES THEN BECAME DATES 
OR YOU SKIPPED MATE AND WENT STRAIGHT FOR DATE 
AND YOU'RE TRYING AT YOUNG LOVE CAN IT LAST THE DISTANCE 
IS THE PERSON YOU'LL SPEND YOUR LIFE WITH 
REALLY GONNA BE SOMEONE YOU MET IN YOUR TEENS 
CAN TEEN ROMANCE LAST 
NO YES ARGH 
WELL POPPY AND KAT WENT TO FIND OUT JUST THAT 
WHEN I FALL IN LOVE IT'LL BE FOREVER SIGH 
WHAT WITH YOURSELF 
FUNNY ANYWAY WE'RE IN BRISTOL TALKING ABOUT ALL THINGS CUPID 
AND WHETHER TEEN ROMANCE CAN ACTUALLY LAST 
I THINK YOU CAN BE EIGHT AND FALL IN LOVE BUT NOT FOREVER 
I THINK YOU CAN FIND THE ONE NOW IF YOU WANT 
NO WAY I THINK I'M MUCH TOO YOUNG 
MAYBE LATER ON IN LIFE LIKE WHEN I'M FIFTY 
ENGAGED NOT MARRIED 
WHAT'S THE POINT OF THAT 
I WON'T PAY OUT FOR A MARRIAGE 
IF YOU CAN FIND THE RIGHT PERSON FROM SUCH A YOUNG AGE 
AND BE ABLE TO STAY WITH THEM FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME 
THEN I THINK SOMETHING CAN LAST 
I'VE GOT MATES IN RELATIONSHIPS BUT I DON'T THINK IT CAN LAST 
THEY'LL GO DOWN TOWN AND TEMPTATION WILL TAKE OVER 
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN PROPERLY LOVE SOMEONE AT YOUR AGE 
OR DO YOU THINK IT'S JUST LUST 
IF YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE THEN YOU FALL IN LOVE 
THEN YOU CAN PROPERLY LOVE THEM 
PROBABLY LUST BUT THEN IF YOU'RE WITH THEN FOR A YEAR OR SOMETHING 
IT COULD BECOME LOVE THEN 
IT'S ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF THE BOND 
IT'S JUST FUN INNIT SOMETHING BETTER TO DO 
I THINK IF YOU WERE REALLY TRULY IN LOVE 
AND YOU COULD LAST FOREVER THEN YEAH I THINK YOU COULD DO IT 
SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN CAN TEEN ROMANCE LAST 
WHAT DO YOU THINK SOPHIE 
I THINK IT CAN COS ME AND TIM HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR NINE MONTHS NOW 
AND I CAN'T SEE MYSELF BEING WITHOUT HIM 
HANG ON A SEC 
I THINK IT CAN BECAUSE ME AND MY BOYFRIEND 
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR TWO YEARS 
AND WE LIVE TOGETHER AND I'M EIGHTEEN AND HE'S NINETEEN 
AND WE LIVE TOGETHER A COMMITMENT WHICH IS A STEP FURTHER 
THAN MOST PEOPLE OUR AGE ARE AT 
HANG ON A SECOND I'LL COME TO YOU WITH THE MICROPHONE MY LOVE 
GO DON'T YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE TOO YOUNG FOR ALL OF THAT STUFF 
HOW OLD ARE YOU YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE TOO YOUNG AT THIS AGE 
YEAH WHY ARE YOU SETTLED DOWN NOW THERE'S YEARS TO DO THAT HAVE FUN 
HANG ON A SEC WE'LL GO BACK TO THE COUPLE 
HANG ON HANG ON A SEC GUYS 
TIM HAVE YOU HAD RELATIONSHIPS BEFORE THIS 
YEAH I'LL ADMIT I'VE BEEN A BIT OF A PLAYER I'VE SCOUTED 
I'VE DONE WHAT I WANT YEAH 
ALL RIGHT HANG ON 
THAT WASN'T THE PATH THAT I WANTED TO TAKE YOU KNOW 
I WANTED A GIRL I COULD GO BACK TO 
AND SOMEONE I COULD TURN TO 
BE COMMITTED TO HER 
WHEN I WAS GOING OUT CHECKING NEXT GIRL EACH WEEK 
SHE WASN'T THERE THE DAY AFTER IF I MET A GIRL I REALLY LIKED 
AND IT WOULD JUST BE A ONE NIGHT STAND 
AND I'D WONDER WHY NOT BE WITH SOMEONE YOU LOVE 
SO BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE 
OF PLAYING THE FIELD A LITTLE BEFOREHAND 
NOW YOU'RE READY TO COMMIT TO HER 
EXPERIENCE WHAT YOU'VE STARTED DATING WHEN YOU WERE SIXTEEN FOURTEEN MAYBE 
TWO YEARS AND THEN A LONG RELATIONSHIP 
JUST COME UP HERE GO AHEAD MATE 
I'D SAY THAT EVERYTHING WE DO IS RELATED TO 
HANG ON GUYS GO AHEAD 
EVERYTHING YOU DO IS RELATED TO ATTRACTION TO SOMEONE ELSE 
SOMEONE YOU THINK'S NICE AT THE TIME 
DO YOU THINK TEEN ROMANCES CAN LAST THOUGH NO I DUNNO 
I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY MORE LUST THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
CAN I ASK SOPHIE TIM'S HAD THIS EXPERIENCE BEFORE YOU HOOKED UP 
HAVE YOU DONE THE SAME THING NO 
YOU HAVEN'T SO IS THIS YOUR FIRST PROPER RELATIONSHIP YEAH 
AWW THAT'S LOVELY 
I MEAN ARE YOU WORRIED 
EVERYONE'S GONNA HAVE A BIG HUG AT THE END 
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT TIM AND HIS HISTORY THEN 
DOES THAT MAKE YOU WORRY AT ALL THAT HE MIGHT PLAY AROUND IN FUTURE 
SOMETIMES IT DOES OR ATTRACTED TO OTHER GIRLS 
COS HE'S STILL QUITE YOUNG HE'S GOT GIRLS THAT ARE FRIENDS 
BUT I THINK I CAN TRUST HIM 
IT'S JUST YOU THINK YOU CAN YEAH I CAN TRUST HIM 
YOU CAN YEAH 
LET ME JUST COME UP TO THIS YOUNG LADY GO AHEAD 
I DON'T WANT A LAUGH I WANT A COMMENT 
TO HAVE PROPER SERIOUS RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE 
WAIT I HAVEN'T FINISHED YET 
IF I MET SOMEONE RIGHT NOW YEAH 
AND THEY WERE ALL I'M NOT DOING TO GO TO UNI I DON'T WANT NO DEGREE

GO AHEAD WELL YOU COULD HAVE A LONG RELATIONSHIP OF COURSE 
BUT YOUR MISSING OUT ON THINGS A TEENAGER SHOULD BE DOING 
AND WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS 
MY SISTER'S SEVENTEEN SHE'S BEEN WITH HER BOYFRIEND BUDGE UP 
WANNA SIT ON MY LAP IT'S NOT THAT SHOW 
FOR TWO YEARS AND THEY'VE JUST HAD A BABY 
AND SHE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE SHE'S MISSING OUT SHE IS HAPPY

WAIT ONE SECOND YOU DID MISS OUT ON THE END OF THAT 
SHE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE SHE'S MISSING OUT AT ALL 
SHE'S HAPPY IT'S WHAT SHE WANTS 
THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS 
SHE HASN'T HAD TIME TO EXPERIENCE ANYTHING ELSE 
SHE HASN'T HAD THE TIME SO SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT 
GUYS DON'T TALK OVER EACH OTHER FOR A SEC 
GO AHEAD RESPOND TO THAT 
SHE'S NOT THE TYPE TO GO OUT CLUBBING 
WE'LL JUST DOWN HERE TOO 
GO AHEAD 
LET ME GET IN HERE 
LOT OF RUNNING AROUND 
I THINK TEENAGE RELATIONSHIPS CAN LAST BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE 
WHO ARE IN THEIR THIRTIES AND THEY MET WHEN THEY WERE FOURTEEN 
AND THEY'RE STILL TOGETHER 
BUT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT SIDES TO IT 
BECAUSE ONE COUPLE THAT I KNOW ARE REALLY HAPPY AND THE OTHER ONE 
SHE'S LIKE I REGRET IT I LOVE HIM 
BUT THERE'S OTHER STUFF I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE 
HE DIDN'T HOLD ME BACK 
BUT I COULDN'T DO ALL I WANTED TO DO BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP 
WE'LL COME TO YOU BUDDY CAN TEEN RELATIONSHIPS CAN LAST I DUNNO 
THESE DAYS IF SOMEONE MAKES OUT WITH SOMEONE ONE NIGHT SUDDENLY 
THEY'RE IN LOVE WITH THEM 
I REALLY LOVE YOU PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS 
IT'S ALL LUST AND INFATUATION THAT'S ALL IT IS 
GO AHEAD 
IT NEVER LASTS 
YOU DON'T KNOW IT NEVER LASTS 
WELL SOMETIMES IT DOES BUT THAT'S ONLY A FEW TIMES 
IT CAN YOU THINK IT CAN 
MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE THEY WERE SEVENTEEN AND ARE STILL HAPPY 
AWW 
SO A CASE IN POINT IT CAN HAPPEN 
IT DEPENDS ON THE PEOPLE 
IF PEOPLE AT SEVENTEEN WANT TO GET TOGETHER AND STAY TOGETHER 
THEN IT'S THEIR CHOICE TO DO THAT 
IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE MORE 
GET MARRIED LATER IN LIFE THEN YOU CAN DO THAT 
SO IT'S UP TO PERSONAL OPINIONS REALLY 
GUYS THAT'S ALL FROM ME 
AND THIS LOVED UP BUNCH OF STUPID CUPID'S SORRY 
SO TODAY'S SHOW HAS SHOWN ME THAT 
YOU NEED TO LOVE YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT
