HELLO AGAIN FROM THE CRUCIBLE AS 
WE ROUND UP A TEN OF THIS EIGHTY TAKE 
COM WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP GET READY 
FOR DRAMA EXCITEMENT THE LOT 
FIRST INTO THE SPOTLIGHT NOT FOR 
THE FIRST ROUND RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
PLAYING FOR A PLACE IN THE QUARTER 
FINALS HE NEEDED ONE FRAME TO WIN 
HIS MATCH WITH MARK WILLIAMS 
DENNIS TAYLOR AND WILLIE THORNE 
WERE IN THE COMMENTARY BOX THIS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT DOTT WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
FANTASTIC IF THE BLACK GOES IN 
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY HE WILL SCORE 
HERE BUT IT IS A TRICKY LITTLE 
BLACK 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HE HAS POTTED 
POTTED ONE BLACK DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
RONNIE WILL HAVE IN HIS MIND HE 
WILL BE TRYING TO STAY ON THE BLACK 
HERE 
I THINK OF IT WASN'T THE HERE LAST FRAME OF THE MATCH I WOULD 
AGREE WITH YOU BUT TO WIN THE 
MATCH AS WELL THESE BALLS ARE 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
HE SLIGHTLY UNDERHIT IT THE RED IN 
THE MIDDLE IS NOT BAD IF HE CAN CUE 
IT 
NICELY I 
AM 
NOT SURE 
IF 
HE CAN 
CUE IT EASILY TO STUN ON FOR THE 
BLACK 
WE WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT BLACK HIS INTENTIONS ARE THE WAY HE PLAYS 
THIS SHOT 
HE'S HITTING THE BALL SO WELL WHEN 
YOU ARE CUEING AT YOUR VERY BEST 
EVEN IN YOUR OWN MIND YOU 
SOMETIMES GENERATE MORE SPIN THAN 
YOU MEAN TO BECAUSE HE IS DOING SO 
WELL HE IS GETTING SO MUCH 
MOVEMENT ON THE CUE BALL THAT HE 
SOMETIMES MOVING OUT OF POSITION 
BECAUSE HE IS JUST TOO GOOD 
THIS WILL BE THE FOURTH BLACK COMING 
UP STEPHEN HENDRY HAS MADE EIGHT 
MAXIMUM BREAKS IN COMPETITIVE PLAY 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HAS MADE EIGHT 
MAXIMUM BREAKS IN COMPETITIVE PLAY 
HE MIGHT BE AFTER ANOTHER RECORD 
THE REASON HE HAS TAKEN THE RED AT 
THE BOTTOM OF THE BUNCH IS BECAUSE 
IT GIVES HIM MORE TARGETS HE KNOWS 
HE HAS GOT ONE TO THE LEFT AND ONE 
TO THE RIGHT 
THIS IS KEY IF THIS 
WORKS OUT HE HAS STUCK ON THEM BUT 
HE HAS STILL GOT ONE TO THE MIDDLE 
HAS HE GOT A BIT OF ANGLE TO TRY 
AND GET BACK TO THE BLACK OFF THIS 
ONE GET BACK TO THE 
THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF ANGLE BUT 
HE MADE IT 
THERE IS A BUZZ GOING ROUND THE 
CRUCIBLE THEATRE THEY KNOW WHAT IS 
HAPPENING HERE JUST A LITTLE BIT 
TOO FAR MAY HAVE TO GET THE 
EXTENSION OUT HERE AND PLAY A 
DELICATE LITTLE SHOT JUST TO DROP 
ON THE BLACK IT SHOULDN'T BE A 
PROBLEM WELL MARK IS JUST 
WONDERING HOW MANY HE IS GOING TO 
SCORE HERE 
HE HAS JUST CLICKED THAT RED WE 
CAN SEE THE CROWD HOPING THEY ARE 
GOING TO WITNESS A BIT OF HISTORY 
HE HAS JUST FLICKED THE RED TO 
COVER BOTH OF THOSE REDS UP INTO 
ONE POCKET SO HE STILL GOT ONE 
MORE KISSED TO PLAY AT SOME STAGE 
HE HAS STILL GOT THIS IS 
PHENOMENAL PLAYER 
JUST ONE MORE 
RED IT HAS TO BE SAID TO MARK 
MAKE TO KNOCK MARK WILLIAMS OUT 
OF THIS WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP AND 
THAT WILL SEND MARK TO THE 
QUALIFYING SCHOOL IT WILL TAKE HIM 
OUT OF THE TOP SIXTEEN 
THIS IS THE KEY 
ONE MARK WILLIAMS NOW KNOWS IT IS 
ALL OVER L. AM SURE HE WILL NOW 
WISH RONNIE A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN HE WILL NOT LIKE 
TO GET BEATEN BUT HE WILL NOT 
BEGRUDGE THE WAY HE IS PLAYING WHEN WILL HE PLAY THE CANNON 
HE WANTED TO GO A LITTLE FURTHER 
AND HE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO FREE ONE 
NEXT TO 
THE 
PINK THAT 
IS THE 
KEY 
HE HASN'T GOT THE 
ANGLE HERE 
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER IT 
POTS YOU KNOW HE MAY NOT HAVE TO 
PLAY THE CANNON 
IT LOOKS TIGHT 
FROM THAT ANGLE 
THERE IS ANOTHER 
EXAMPLE OF PLAYING FOR TWO REDS AT 
ONCE THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE GOT TO 
DO IN THIS SITUATION HE HAS TRIED IT WHAT A SHOT 
THAT IS ONE OF THE BEST POSITIONAL 
SHOTS I HAVE EVER SEEN 
TO GENERATE 
THE ANGLE HE DID TO GET THE CANNON 
AND TO CONTROL ITS WELL HE 
DESERVES ONE NOW AND TO CONTROL 
IT 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND AVAILABLE FOR THE MAXIMUM 
THIS COULD BE THE LAST WORRYING 
SHOT HE IS PERFECT 
FOUR COLOURS TO BEAT STEPHEN 
HENDRY'S RECORD THAT HE JOINED THE 
HOLES WITH STEPHEN AT THE MOMENT 
THIS WILL BE HIS NINTH MAXIMUM BREAK 
THAT HE HORSE WITH STEPHEN TO TO QUOTE JACK HARMAN GOOD LUCK SON 
BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN FLAWLESS 
THIS PLACE WILL ERUPT IF THIS BLACK 
DISAPPEARS THIS HAS BEEN 
UNBELIEVABLE PLAY HAS STOPPED ON 
THE OTHER TABLE HE'S DONE IT WHAT 
AN UNBELIEVABLE BREAK THAT WAS 
PROBABLY HIS BEST MAXIMUM HE HAS 
EVER GOT THAT WAS UP THERE WITH 
THE VERY BEST 
IT JUST DOESN'T GET 
ANY BETTER THAN THAT THAT IS THREE 
OF HIS MAXIMUM BREAKS THE MAN IS A 
TOTAL GENIUS 
THAT WAS THE BEST ONE YOU HAVE EVER 
DONE HOW ABOUT WHEN YOU BOUNCED IT 
AND FLICKED THE RED YOU MOVE THE 
RED AWAY TO GIVE THE ROOM TO GET TO 
THE BLACK THERE WAS A PYRAMID OF 
SIX THAT GAVE YOU ROOM TO PLAY THE 
NEXT ONE FANTASTIC 
THAT WAS SOMETHING 
NOTHING CAN COMPARE TO ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THE 
ADRENALINE THE FEELING AND THE 
BLOOD JUST PUMPING AROUND MY HEART 
AND MY BODY IT STILL IS L. HAVE 
CALMED DOWN A BIT BECAUSE I HAVE 
HAD A FEW ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVENS AND WHEN YOU GET TO 
A CERTAIN STAGE YOU ARE 
DISAPPOINTED IF YOU DON'T MAKE THEM 
BUT ACTUALLY DO IT AND YOU KNOW 
IT IS GREAT GREAT FEELING MY 
MISSUS RECKONS I. AND THE TIGHTEST 
MAN ON THE PLANET L. L. DON'T THINK IT 
IS TRUE L. MIGHT BUY MYSELF 
BENTLEY CONVERTIBLE L. HAVE 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND HOPEFULLY NOBODY WILL GET 
ANOTHER ONE MIGHT GET BED 
BEFORE THE SUMMER JUST TO FLOAT 
ABOUT IN AND I MIGHT GET 
MYSELF A 
NEW PAIR OF RUNNING TRAINERS 
WILL GET MY SHOPPING THIS OUT LATER 
I AM GOING TO BUY MYSELF SOME 
PRESENTS LATER 
RONNIE HAS IT THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVENS THE BONUS HE 
HAS LEARNT IS JUST UNDER HALF A 
MILLION POUNDS ACTION NOW TO SEE 
YOU WOULD PLAY RONNIE IN THE 
QUARTER FINALS JOE SWAIL ALL LIANG 
WENBO IT WAS NINE TO SEVEN TO THE TWENTY ONE A LOT 
CHINESE PLAYER GOING TO THE FINAL 
SESSION THIS WAS A CLASSIC CASE OF 
YOUTH VERSUS EXPERIENCE CRUCIBLE 
DEBUT FOR LIANG SWAIL WAS MAKING 
COMMENTARY ONCE AGAIN FROM DENNIS 
AND WILLIE 
IDEALLY DENNIS HE IS LOOKING AT 
THE SCORE BOARD IF HE TAKES THE 
BLACK HE ONLY NEEDS THE BLUE THAT 
MEANS BLUE TO PINK WILL 
NOT BE 
A 
PROBLEM 
IF HE 
GETS ON THE YELLOW 
HERE AND 
NOT THE 
BACK 
IT IS 
A 
TOUGH SHOT 
TO PLAY 
HE 
WILL NEED 
BLUE TO PINK AS WELL 
JOE DOESN'T 
WANT TO LOOK IT HAS BEEN SUCH A 
COMEBACK 
IS THERE YOU ARE COMING BACK ONTO 
THE BLACK SPOT IS THE YELLOW 
COMING BACK 
THAT WAS JOE'S MISS THAT WAS MY MISTAKE ON THE 
SCOREBOARD HE CAN GET AWAY WITH IT 
WITH JUST THE BLUE HE HAS TO BE 
TOP SIDE OF THE BROWN TO MAKE THE 
BLUE A CERTAINTY LIKE JOE'S LAST 
SHOT YOU DON'T NEED A TRICKY SHOT 
ALONG THE CUSHION 
HE CUED IT VERY SMOOTH THE UNDER 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE PERFECT 
ANGLE TO DROP IN BEHIND THE BLUE 
TWO OF THE BIGGEST SHOTS HE HAS 
EVER PLAYED IN HIS LIFE JUST THE BLUE NEEDED 
AND IT'S THERE THAT'S WHAT IT 
MEANS TO THIS YOUNG CHINESE PLAYER 
HE RAISES HIS FIST IN THE AIR WHAT 
A PERFORMANCE FROM THIS YOUNG 
ROOKIE CARRYING THE FLAG FOR CHINA 
THE PINK ISN'T IN BUT SURELY 
THAT'S ENOUGH TO TAKE THIS YOUNG 
PLAYER THROUGH TO THE CORNER FOR 
A QUARTER FINAL THIS YEAR'S WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
YES IT WAS A LITTLE CHAMPIONSHIP BIT OF A PREMATURE CLENCH OF THE 
FIST THERE BECAUSE ONLY ONE 
SNOOKER NEEDED 
YES THE BLACK IS A BIT AWKWARD FOR 
JOE TO GET THE SNOOKER NOT HARD 
ENOUGH 
WELL HE DID GET THE SNOOKER IN THE 
END BUT IT IS AN EASY ESCAPE 
BUT I AM WITH YOU WILLIE IT WAS A 
BIT 
PREMATURE 
TO THROW THAT FIST UP 
IN THE AIR THIS HAS GOT A CHANCE 
ANOTHER TWO INCHES AND THIS WOULD 
HAVE BEEN TIGHT BEHIND THE BLACK 
AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HIT 
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE JOE CAN'T 
BELIEVE IT STEWARDS IF 
YOU CAN SEE THAT PERSON SHOUTING 
WE WILL HAVE HIM OUT PLEASE HIS HIS REACTION ON HIS FACE AS HE LEANS ON 
THE TABLE THERE L. DON'T THINK JOE 
CAN RISK THE POT BECAUSE IT WILL 
THROW WIDE AND HE MIGHT CATCH THE 
JAWS OF THE CORNER PLAYING IT SLOW 
YOU WON'T CATCH THE JAWS HE 
WON'T 
YES DBV TOOK THE POT ON HE WON'T WOULD BE CLOSE ENOUGH IF HE TOOK 
THE POT ON HE HAS PLAYED IT 
PERFECTLY 
THE COMEBACK KID IS NOT FINISHED 
YET 
I THINK IT IS ON 
THE PINK CUP'S 
AND I THINK HE CAN GET ENOUGH ON 
THE CUE BALL TO STOP THE WHITE FROM 
GOING IN THE CORNER POCKET THIS IS 
QUITE AMAZING 
WHAT A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM THIS 
COULD BE 
IT IS ONE OF THOSE WHERE 
YOU WOULD LIKE TO PLAY THE STUN 
SHOT HE WANTS THE WHITE CLEANING 
THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE CRUCIBLE 
THEATRE LIANG WENBO HAD ONE FOOT 
IN THE QUARTER FINAL HE DOESN'T 
WANT TO LOOK NOW 
HE'S NOT FINISHED YET JOE SWAIL 
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE THE YOUNG 
CHINESE PLAYER THOUGHT 
THE QUARTER 
FINAL HE 
RAISED 
FIST BUT 
IT IS NOT OVER YET JOE 
SWAIL TAKES THE FRAME AND IT IS NOW 
TWELVE TO ELEVEN TWELVE TO ELEVEN ANSON SOCIALLY JOE TO 
GO TO FINAL FRAME DECIDER THE 
GUTSY PRO FROM NORTHERN IRELAND 
NEVER KNOWS WHEN HE IS BEATEN WHAT 
A CLIMAX TO A GREAT MATCH 
THE LAST THREE FRAMES WOULD HAVE 
WEAKENED A LOT OF PEOPLE 
ONCE AGAIN PUNCHING THE SHOT IN 
THAT IS THE WAY HE PREFERS TO PLAY 
THEM 
WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR THE 
LAST THREE FRAMES BUT HE HASN'T 
SCORED ENOUGH POINTS IN THE LAST 
THREE FRAMES HE HAS ALWAYS BROKEN 
DOWN AROUND IN FRONT BUT THE 
PRESSURE HE MUST BE UNDER AT THE 
MOMENT WELL THERE IT SHOWS YOU 
HE DROPPED HIS CHALK HE LOOKS 
PRETTY CALM JOE SWAIL HAS MADE A 
REMARKABLE COMEBACK ONCE AGAIN AT 
THE CRUCIBLE THIS IS THE KEY SHOT 
I THINK HE SHOULD PLAY FOR THE TWO 
REDS AT THIS STAGE JUST TRY AND 
GET A FIFTY POINTS LEAD 
DEPENDING ON THE ANGLE HE MAY BE 
ABLE TO JUST FORCE IT OVER ANYWHERE 
NEAR THE CIRCLE HE CAN SCREW BACK 
AND LEAVE THE TWO REDS INTO THE 
SAME POCKET 
I THINK IT WAS EASIER TO LEAVE THE 
REDS FOR THE MIDDLE POCKET 
I THINK WE HAVE BEEN HERE SOMEWHERE 
BEFORE AND THE LAST HOUR A FORTY 
LEAD WELL THERE THE THIRTY FOUR THIS 
TIME IF FORTY POINT LEAD WELL THIRTY FOUR 
THIS TIME 
HE HAS PLAYED AN EXCELLENT SAFETY 
SHOT WELL PLAYED ON THE THE 
UTMOST PRESSURE THAT IS VERY GOOD 
WONDER UNDER 
I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT BE GOING 
OVER THAT SIDE OF THE ARENA IT IS 
DARK OVER THERE WHEN YOU WALK OUT 
OF THE DARK BACK INTO THE BRIGHT 
LIGHTS HE HAS GIVEN HIS CUE A 
LITTLE KISS IS IT GOING TO WORK 
FOR HIM CUE 
THAT IS TERRIFIC AND HE LOOKS 
PRETTY CALM AND COOL OUT THERE HOW 
DOES HE DO IT ON BUT THIS PRESSURE 
UNDER THIS PRESSURE HIM 
HE HAS THE OPTION OF TWO REDS HE 
HAS GOT OPTIONS BLESSED WITH 
WONDERFUL CUE POWER JOE SWAIL HE 
HAS PLAYED FOR THE RED IN THE 
CORNER OR IN THE MIDDLE HE HAS THE 
CHOICE OF TWO IT WILL BE THE ONE 
IN THE QUARTER HE PLAYS BACK IN 
THE CORNER 
JUST NEEDS TO SCREW BACK THREE OR 
FOUR INCHES 
WHATEVER HAPPENS HE IS BACK IN THE 
FRAME THIS IS THE BIG SHOT COMING UP 
HE HAS NOT SPLIT THE REDS I 
THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE SPLIT THEM 
PERFECTLY 
HE WANTED TO CATCH IT A LITTLE BIT 
FULLER THE WHITE WOULD NOT HAVE 
SLIPPED 
THE YELLOW AND PINK ARE NOT BADLY 
PLACED LOOKS PRETTY GOOD THIS IT 
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE SHOT THEY 
GET JOE SWAIL SOMEHOW INTO THE 
QUARTER FINAL THAT GETS JOE 
SWAIL SOMEHOW IT TO THE QUARTER 
FINAL 
HE DOES PLAY SOME STRANGE SHOT THE 
BOYS BOYS I THINK TO BE FAIR TO HIM THAT 
TIME HE DID TRY TO LAND ON THE ONE 
NEAR THE CUSHION BUT JUST MISSED 
JUDGED IT SLIGHTLY BACK MISSED 
JUDGED MISJUDGED IT 
HE CAN TRY TO GET IN BEHIND THE 
YELLOW AND PINK AGAIN HERE 
I THINK HE WANTS TO HAVE A GO AT 
THIS ONE HE HAS PAUL OF SOME 
INCREDIBLE POT UNDER PRESSURE THIS 
WILL BE ANOTHER PULLED OFF SOME 
INCREDIBLE POTS UNDER PRESSURE NOT 
THIS TIME DID NOT QUITE CUE THAT 
I DO NOT THINK HE INTENDED TO LEAVE 
THE WHITE AS CLOSE TO THE CUSHION 
AS THIS 
IF HE DECIDES TO PLAY THIS CUT BACK 
INTO THE CORNER THE WHITE WILL BE 
RUNNING FREE 
HE DOES LIKE TO PUT ALL OF HIS EGGS 
IN ONE BASKET HE HAS BEEN A BRASH 
THE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR TO THIS 
TOURNAMENT BUT THIS COULD BE A 
REAL BIG SCAR ON HIS CONFIDENCE FOR 
FUTURE MATCHES HE HAS GOT TO LEARN 
TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT TIME AND THE 
WRONG TIME TO PLAY SHOTS L. DO NOT 
BLAME HIM FOR TAKING A SHOT ON BUT 
PLAYED IN AND OUT OF BAULK OR 
SOMETHING 
HE HAS GOT A CHANCE OF THE BROWN 
IF HE IS DEAD STRAIGHT HE CAN GET 
BACK FOR THE RED THAT IS NEAR THE 
YELLOW AND PINK IF HE HAS GOT 
BETTER ANGLE HE CAN GET UP FOR THE 
ONE NEAR THE PINK SPOT 
HAS HE GOT THE SIDE ON IT HE IS A 
BIT FURTHER AWAY FROM IT THAN HE 
INTENDED IT IS STILL THERE AND HE 
CAN AVOID THE CANNON AND GET ON THE 
BLACK THINK HE CAN EVEN IF HE 
CATCHES ONE OF THE REDS HE WILL 
STILL FINISH ON THE BLACK ANOTHER 
BIG SHOT 
FABULOUS SHOT HE FLOATED IT IN IT 
COULD BE A FRAME AND IT COULD BE A 
MATCH WINNER 
HE HAS GONE A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR 
HAS HE NO HE IS O. K. THE COMEBACK 
JOE HAD AGAINST JOHN PARROTT WAS 
VERY SPECIAL TWELVE TO WAIT TO WIN THIRTEEN 
TWELVE TWELVE TO EIGHT THINK THIS 
WOULD BE EVEN MORE SPECIAL THE 
WHITE FLEW OFF THE BACK CUSHION 
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
WITHOUT THE BOUNCE HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN SOMEWHERE NEAR THAT WHITE I 
HAVE PUT UP AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
IN PERFECT POSITION 
THE SAVING GRACE HERE IS THIS RED 
IS DEAD STRAIGHT 
I THINK I WOULD DEFINITELY BE 
TEMPTED TO PLAY THE ONE WITH THE 
REST IT TAKES THE PRESSURE OFF IF 
HE STOPS THE CUE BALL DEAD 
EVEN THE TWO ON THE PINK SPOT HE 
WOULD HAVE NEEDED THE REST THIS IS 
DEFINITELY THE CORRECT SHOT 
THAT WAS SUCH A HARD CHANCE LIANG 
WENBO ALL HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE 
THIS COULD BE IT WILL HAVE ONE 
LAST CHANCE THIS COULD BE IT 
HE IS GOING TO NEED THE REST ALSO 
HE IS LEFT HANDED BUT I STILL DO 
NOT THINK HE CAN REST HE CAN 
STRETCH ACROSS HE WILL BE FULLY 
STRETCHED TO GET TO THIS 
IF THIS GOES IN IT IS ALL ABOUT THE 
RED THAT IS TIGHTEN THE BACK 
CUSHION TIGHT UPON THE BACK 
CUSHION 
WELL HE HAS GOT AN ANGLE AND IF HE 
CAN GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE CIRCLE HE 
WOULD BE PERFECTLY PLACED HE IS ON 
THE SAME LINE 
HE IS GOING TO NEED THE YELLOW AS 
WELL HOW DOES HE GET FROM BLACK TO 
YELLOW 
I THINK HE IS GOING TO DO WHAT HE 
SAID BEFORE THE SESSION HE IS 
GOING TO TAKE ONE BALL AT TIME 
JOE SWAIL WHAT A COMEBACK HE HAD 
ME IT 
AND HE MAY STILL GET THE ONE LAST 
CHANCE 
THIS IS THE KEY HE IS NOW HAVING 
THE RED CLEANED HE IS JUST GOING 
TO DROP THIS IN WHAT A MATCH CAN 
THIS YOUNG CHINESE PLAYER PAUL THIS 
OUT OF THE FIRE AFTER LOSING FOUR 
IN A ROW IF HE DOES IT WOULD BE 
QUITE REMARKABLE 
IT IS ONE OF THOSE SHOTS WORRY 
WERE IF HE HAD NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE 
RED HE WOULD HAVE AT THE SNOOKER 
BEHIND THE BLACK IT IS THEIR IT 
IS THERE 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT HE WANTS 
TO GET AS CLOSE TO THE YELLOW AS 
POSSIBLE AND HE CAN AVOID THE 
MIDDLE POCKET 
THE GOOD NEWS IS JO 
CAN ONLY TIE AT THE MOMENT 
I DO NOT THINK HE WILL WAIT HIS ARM 
IN THE AIR THE YELLOW GOES IN L. 
THINK HE WILL GIVE IT ANOTHER 
COUPLE OF SHOTS THE YOUNG BOY 
WHATEVER HAPPENS YOU HAVE GOT TO 
TAKE YOUR HAT OFF TO HIM HE HAS 
BEEN A BREATH OF FRESH AIR TO THIS 
TOURNAMENT TOURNAMENT HE IS STILL OVER ON THE OTHER TABLE HE HAS MISSED THAT 
SURELY BE COULD NOT HAVE A RE 
SPOTTED BLACK HAS HE GOT THE 
SNOOKER IT MUST BE 
YES LOOK AT THAT 
A SWERVE IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE L. KNOW 
IT IS A HORRIBLE SHOT TO PLAY BUT 
GOING IN BEHIND IT I AM NOT TOO 
SURE WHETHER THE CAN GET THE YELLOW 
IF HE TRIED TO SWERVE IT AROUND AND 
POTTED THE YELLOW WITH THE WHITE 
BEHIND 
I THINK HE WILL DO REALLY WELL TO 
GET THE A LA PAST THE BAULK LINE 
THE YELLOW HE IS PLAYING CUSHION FIRST GREAT SHOT 
THE WAY THE CROWD ARE REACTING YOU 
WOULD THINK THIS IS THE FINAL OF 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP THAT IS A 
GREAT SHOT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
I SUPPOSE IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF 
PRESSURE OFF THE SHOT THE FACT HE 
WAS TWENTY SEVEN IN FRONT 
IF HE CAN SEE ENOUGH OF THE RIGHT 
SIDE OF IT NO HE CANNOT 
YOU ARE KIDDING ME THAT SNOOKER 
WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS FOR SOMEBODY 
OF HIS CLASS THAT WAS PURE TENSION 
THAT MADE HIM MISS THAT IT WAS ON 
MISS A BALL UNMISSABLE THERE 
ARE MORE TWISTS AND TURNS IN THIS 
THAN I HAVE EVER SEEN IN A MATCH 
EVEN THOUGH HE IS TWENTY SEVEN POINTS IN 
FRONT ALAN CHAMBERLAIN IS ENTITLED 
TO CALL THE MISS UNDER THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN 
THE PLAYER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT 
THERE IT WAS NOT IN HIS FAVOUR TO 
MISS THE SNOOKER 
THE REFEREE CAN DO IT WITH 
DISCRETION HE DOES NOT HAVE TO 
CALL THE MISS IF HE HITS IT WERE 
THEY GOING TO FINISH 
JOE SWAIL HAS HAD A LITTLE LOOK AT 
THE REFEREE JOE SWAIL IS 
SUGGESTING THE BALLS WERE NOT IN 
THE RIGHT POSITION HE SHOULD HAVE 
DONE THAT BEFORE YOU CANNOT DO IT 
ONCE THE SHOT HAS BEEN PLAYED 
FAIR COMMENT JOE SWAIL PROBABLY 
SHOULD HAVE ASKED THAT IS A STRANGE ONE 
WE CAN SHOW YOU WHERE THEIR WORK 
FIRST TIME WERE THEIR WAR 
ALAN HAS CAUSED A PROBLEM FOR 
HIMSELF THERE HE SHOULD HAVE 
LOOKED AT THE MONITOR AND NATURE OF 
THE BALLS WERE EXACTLY AS THEY WAR 
MADE SURE OF THE BALLS WERE 
EXACTLY AS THEY WERE POSITIONED 
BEFORE 
THIS IS A TRICKY SHOT TO PLAY HE 
NEEDS THE YELLOW AND GREEN HE LOST 
THE FRAME NEEDING A SNOOKER HE WAS 
TWENTY SEVEN IN FRONT WITH TWENTY SEVEN ON IT IS DEEP 
BREATH TIME 
HE HAS POTTED THE GREEN BELIEVE IT 
OR NOT AND THE WHITE HAS COME 
ROUND ON THE YELLOW WHAT AN 
AMAZING MATCH THIS IS TURNING OUT 
TO BE BOTH PLAYERS MUST BE IN BITS 
AT THE MOMENT HE FORCES LITTLE WRY SMILE 
BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THIS 
IS FAR FROM EASY 
ESPECIALLY AS HE NEEDS TO FINISH 
HIGH ON THE GREEN BECAUSE THE PINK 
IS IN THE WAY HE NEEDS TO COME TOP 
SIDE OF THE GREEN HE IS O. K. IS 
FOURTEEN POINTS BEHIND HEANEY IS A LOT 
HE NEEDS THE LOT 
WELL I SAID ANYTHING CAN BE MISSED 
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE 
PRESSURE ON BOTH PLAYERS IS QUITE 
AMAZING AND IT IS NOW ONE OF THOSE 
MATCHES WILLIE THAT YOU DO NOT 
WANT TO SEE EITHER PLAYER LOOSE 
A I HAVE NEVER WISHED FOR A DRAW AT 
THE CRUCIBLE BUT THIS ONE DESERVES 
TO BE ONE 
MEET THE BLUE HE NEEDS THE BLUE 
AND HE HAS GOT TO PLAY IT WITH LOTS 
OF POWER TO SCREW THE WHITE BACK 
EARLIER IN THE WEEK THIS WOULD HAVE 
BEEN A CERTAINTY DO NOT DO IT JUST YET 
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE WHAT A MATCH 
THE YOUNG MAN LEAD BY TWELVE TO EIGHT 
JOE SWAIL HAD A MAGNIFICENT 
COMEBACK 
THIS TIME IT SURELY HE HAS GOT TO 
BE IN THE QUARTER FINALS TWO 
SNOOKERS NEEDED 
I HAVE SEEN SOME TENSE FINISHES 
HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE L. 
HAVE SEEN THEM FINISH AT TEN MINUTES 
TO FOUR IN THE MORNING BUT JOE 
SWAIL CAN BE PROUD OF HIMSELF 
LIANG WENBO DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO 
DO AT THE MOMENT 
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE LIANG WENBO 
JOHN'S WITH JOY YOU HAVE GOT TO 
GIVE GREAT CREDIT TO JOE SWAIL IT 
WAS A REMARKABLE FIGHTBACK BUT HE 
DID NOT QUITE MAKE IT 
CONGRATULATIONS AND A STANDING 
OVATION FOR BOTH PLAYERS THE YOUNG 
CHINESE PLAYER GOES THROUGH TO THE 
QUARTER FINAL AT LONG LAST FIFTEENTH 
THIRTEEN TWELVE 
ANOTHER PLAYER THROUGH TO THE 
QUARTER FINALS IS STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
OF SCOTLAND HE WON THE HE WON 
THE FIRST SESSION OF HIS MATCH 
AGAINST NEIL ROBERTSON ROBERTSON 
FORCED HIS WAY BACK AND STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE GOT THE TWO FRENZY IT NINE TO ZERO 
AHEAD I KNEW HE WAS GREAT TO BE IN 
THE NEXT ROUND AND HAVE THINK 
IT WAS A LOT HARDER TO BUILD MYSELF 
UP FOR THE MATCH THAN WHAT IT 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RESULT IS A 
RESULT RESULT REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF IT 
WAS DEFINITELY A GREAT CHANCE AND I 
THOUGHT I WAS IT IS SOME REALLY 
GREAT FORM WITH THE DRAW OPENING 
UP A LITTLE BIT AS WELL I THOUGHT 
I HAD A GOOD CHANCE OF GETTING TO 
THE FINAL 
IT IS HARD NOT TO LOOK FURTHER 
AHEAD BUT I THINK THAT IS THE 
SCHOOLBOY ERROR IF YOU START 
THINKING ABOUT THE ROUND AFTER OF 
THE NEXT ONE 
IT WAS THE MATCH BETWEEN JOE PERRY 
AND STUART BINGHAM THAT DECIDED WHO 
STEPHEN WOULD MEET IN THE LAST 
EIGHT JOE PERRY RAN OUT A THIRTEEN EIGHT 
WINNER WINNER I FELT LIKE I WAS IN CONTROL OF MY 
EMOTIONS L. DO NOT WANT TO FALL 
INTO THE MOOD I WAS IN IN THE FIRST 
SESSION WORRY DID NOT CARE WHAT 
HAPPENED L. WANTED TO STAY FOCUSSED 
LIKE IT MADE EVERYTHING HOPEFULLY 
THAT IS HOW I PLAYED I'M REALLY 
HAPPY WITH HOW I AM PLAYING IF 
CHANCES WAY THERE THINK I AM 
PLAYING WELL ENOUGH TO TAKE THEM 
LONG MAY IT CONTINUE 
ALL FOUR QUARTER FINALS BREAK OFF
