FRONTLINE AFGHANISTAN CAN THE 
BRITISH HOLD ON TO THE VITAL TOWN 
OF MUSA QALA 
TONIGHT IS NATO WINNING THE WAR 
IN AFGHANISTAN AND HOW ARE THEY 
HOLDING ON TO GROUND GAINED FROM 
THE TALEBAN MARK URBAN HAS SPENT 
NINE DAYS WITH BRITISH SOLDIERS IN 
HELMAND PROVINCE WE HAVE 
EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO THIS CRUCIAL 
BATTLEGROUND O. THE TALEBAN SEEM TO BE 
SWITCHING TACTICS TOO MORE 
TOWARDS BOOBY TRAPS AND HIT AND RUN 
ATTACKS ATTACKS WE COUNTED THEM ALL IN AND WE'RE 
COUNTING THEM ALL BACK OUT IS THE 
IMMIGRATION PICTURE GETTING 
CLEARER CLEARER MORE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE 
BREATHTAKING INHUMANITY OF THE 
AUSTRIAN FATHER OF FOURTEEN 
AND TONIGHT IT'S THE TORIES' 
ELECTION SUPREMO'S TURN TO TELL US 
WHY HE THINKS HIS PARTY'S ON TRACK 
GOOD EVENING TONIGHT A NEWSNIGHT 
EXCLUSIVE THE INSIDE STORY OF THE 
BRITISH MISSION IN MUSA QALA THE 
BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF THE AFGHAN 
TOWN AND THE SURROUNDING AREA HAS 
COME TO EPITOMISE THE TRIAL OF 
STRENGTH BETWEEN THE BRITISH ARMY 
AND ITS TALEBAN ENEMY IN HELMAND 
PROVINCE MUSA QALA IS IN THE 
SOUTH WESTERN PROVINCE OF HELMAND 
BRITISH FORCES TOOK RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR THE AREA IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND SIX 
BUT THEY FACED FIERCE FIGHTING FROM 
THE TALEBAN AND WERE FORCED TO 
LEAVE THAT OCTOBER IN FEBRUARY 
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN SEVERAL HUNDRED TALEBAN 
FIGHTERS TOOK CONTROL OF MUSA QALA 
TOWN BRITISH TROOPS ONLY REGAINED 
CONTROL OF THE AREA LATE LAST YEAR 
AND HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO HOLD ON 
TO IT EVER SINCE OUR DEFENCE 
EDITOR MARK URBAN SPENT NINE DAYS 
WITH THE BRITISH TROOPS TRYING TO 
WIN OVER SUSPICIOUS LOCALS IN A 
TOWN WHERE THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF 
SUPPORT FOR THE TALEBAN 
THE TRIP INTO MUSA QALA BAZAAR IS 
NOT ONE FOR THE NERVOUS SHOPPER 
IN THE WEEKS FOLLOWING THE BRITISH 
ARMY'S CAPTURE OF THIS TOWN FROM 
THE TALEBAN THEY HAVE COME UNDER 
ATTACK MANY TIMES THE FEEL OF 
SUICIDE BOMBERS MEANS THAT SOLDIERS 
WANT TAKE CHANCES WILL NOT TAKE 
CHANCES 
CAN WE GET SOME POLICE UP THEIR 
EVERYONE IS TENSE THERE AS FOR 
LOCAL PEOPLE CAUGHT IN THIS TRAIN 
OF VIOLENCE MOST DO NOT EVEN 
ACKNOWLEDGE THE UNIVERSAL AFGHAN OR 
MUSLIM GREETING IS THIS HATRED OR 
FEAR OR IT IS NOT CLEAR FEAR 
AFTER MANY ATTEMPTS I FOUND A 
COUPLE OF FRUIT SELLERS WILLING TO 
TALK A LITTLE 
NOW IN THE BAZAAR 
IT'S O. K. BUT OUTSIDE IT'S NOT SAFE 
NO IT'S NOT GOOD 
THERE IS NO SECURITY I DON'T KNOW 
WHO IS A CRIMINAL AND WHO IS 
RESPECTABLE IT'S CHAOS 
THAT IS THE KEY MESSAGE HERE WHILE 
THE TOWN CENTRE IS UNDER A FORM OF 
CONTROL THE BADLANDS BEGIN JUST A 
FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY THAT IS 
WHERE THE TALEBAN MOVE BY KNIGHT 
AND THREATEN ANYONE WHO CO OPERATES 
WITH THE BRITISH 
BACK THROUGH THE POPPY FIELDS TO 
THE DISTRICT CENTRE A SMALL HAVEN 
OF NATO AND AFGHAN GOVERNMENT 
AUTHORITY THE IMPRESSION I GET 
CLEARLY IS OF A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE 
ARE UNCERTAIN BIDING THEIR 
TIME 
AND CLEARLY NOT WISHING TO BE 
OVERLY FRIENDLY OR WELCOMING 
TOWARDS THE PEOPLE WE ARE WITH 
THAT'S HOW IT GENERALLY IS IN ALSO 
COLOUR 
WHEN YOU WANNA WITH PEOPLE COLOUR THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN 
ABOUT ANY THREATS THERE MIGHT BE 
ABSOLUTELY THE SUICIDE BOMBING IS 
THE ABSOLUTE PRIORITY THREAT IN THE 
CENTRE OF WAS THE COLOUR IT'S JUST 
WAS A COLOUR 
AS FOR WHAT IS AT 
STAKE HERE BRITISH COMMANDERS HAVE 
NOW DECREED THAT THEIR ENTIRE 
STRATEGY FOR HELMAND COULD STAND OR 
FALL BY WHAT HAPPENS IN WATERCOLOUR 
AS LONG AS MR. COLLETT EXISTED IN 
THE STATE THAT IT WAS WHICH WAS 
HEAVILY TALEBAN A NEXUS BETWEEN 
THE TALEBAN AND OTHER GROUPS AS 
LONG AS MUSA QALA EXISTED WE 
COULD NOT SECURED THE AREA AT ALL 
IT WAS ICONIC FOR ALL THE WRONG 
REASONS IT IS NOW ICONIC FOR ALL 
THE WHITE REASONS AND IT'S SIMPLY 
GOT TO SUCCEED 
THE ARMY HAS PLENTY 
OF HISTORY IN THIS PLACE ALL FOR 
RIGHT REASONS 
PREVIOUSLY THE ARMY HAD TO LEAVE 
MUSA QALA AFTER WEEKS OF INTENSE 
FIGHTING FOR SOME MEN THERE ARE 
DIFFICULT MEMORIES OF WHAT HAPPENED 
BEFORE HERE 
THE TALEBAN ESCORTED 
US OUT OF AREAS WHICH THEY KNEW WAS 
SAFE FOR US BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR 
DEAL AS SOON AS THE LAST VEHICLE 
LEFT THE MAIN COMPOUND THEY MOVED 
BACK IN IT WAS VERY DEPRESSING FOR 
THE LADS BECAUSE THEY HAD FOUGHT 
AND PEOPLE HAD DIED THERE GOOD 
FRIENDS OF MINE DIED THERE FOR 
NOTHING REALLY 
THAT DAY WE WOULD 
HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO GET OUT OF IT 
BASICALLY WE HAVE TO TRUST THE 
TALEBAN WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING 
THAT ANY BRITISH SOLDIER WOULD EVER 
DO BUT WE HAVE TO TRUST THEM WITH 
OUR LIVES 
THE RANGERS ARE BACK IN MUSA QALA 
AS MENTORING TEAM FOR THE AFGHAN 
ARMY THEIR COMMANDER REALISED SOON 
AFTER GETTING HERE THAT MUCH HAS 
CHANGED SINCE NATO AND AFGHAN 
FORCES RETOOK THE TOWN BACK IN 
SEPTEMBER IN DECEMBER 
HOW RING HAD SOLDIERS WHO HAD BEEN 
IN MUSA QALA IN TWO THOUSAND SIX HAVING HAD 
SOLDIERS WHO HAD THEIR OWN STORY 
THERE WAS THAT SENSE OF 
APPREHENSION AND NOW ACTUALLY 
BEING HERE AS WE ARE SITTING HERE 
YOU CAN HEAR THE BIRDS SINGING 
IT'S RELATIVELY QUIET 
QUIET IN MUSA QALA HAS ITS OWN 
MEANING 
THERE ARE STILL INCIDENTS HERE MOST 
DAYS AS BOTH SIDES ADJUST TO NEW 
REALITIES A LONG STRUGGLE IN 
WHICH BRITISH TROOPS ARE TRYING TO 
EXTEND THEIR CONTROL AND THE 
TALEBAN TO THWART THEM OVER THE 
COURSE OF A WEEK WE WATCHED THAT 
CONTEST 
ONCE WE GET UP TO HERE WE WILL 
BREAK OFF ONTO THIS ROUTE UP HERE 
AND WE WILL GO TO THE CONTROL BASED 
SITE SITE FRIDAY MAJOR DAVE KENNY AND 
ANOTHER COMMANDER GO OUT TO PATROL 
BASE NORTH IT IS NOT MUCH MORE 
THAN A KILOMETRE OR FROM THE 
BIZARRE THESE ARE THE OUTSKIRTS 
WHERE THE FRUIT SELLER SAID 
SECURITY WAS PROBLEM 
WE'RE JUST HEADING TO THAT ENTRANCE 
WE WILL MOVE ON UP NOW 
A TEAM OF SIX SOLDIERS OPERATE FROM 
HERE WITH ABOUT FIFTY AFGHANS 
BUT NOW THEY ARE ABOUT TO MOVE TO 
A NEW BASE SEVERAL HUNDRED METRES 
FURTHER FORWARD AND THE ENGINEERS 
ARE PUTTING THE FINISHING TOUCHES 
TO IT THERE IS JUST ONE PROBLEM 
I THINK WE ALL THOUGHT THIS WOULD 
BE MUCH FURTHER UP THEIR THE THE OFFICERS ARE WONDERING IF THE BASE 
HAS BEEN PUT IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
THERE 
A WE NEED TO BE ON THE 
HIGH GROUND TO BE ABLE TO SEE TO 
THE NORTH WE NEED TO BE UP TO 
PROTECT OURSELVES AS WELL WE 
NEED THE ISSUE FOR ME NOW AND FOR 
THE AFGHAN NATIONAL ARMY SOLDIERS 
IS GETTING FROM THERE TO HEAR JUST JUST ABOVE THE NEW BASE ARE TWO OUTPOSTS 
WHICH THE SAPPERS WORK TO FINISH 
HERE THIS IS THE OBVIOUS PLACE FOR 
A BASE SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN THE 
ROYAL IRISH ARRIVED HERE THEY 
DISCOVERED A LARGE BOOBY TRAPPED 
BOMB LAID BY THE TIME THE BACK 
LAID BY THE TALEBAN THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW ROUTES TO 
THE NORTH OF MUSA QALA SYMBOLISES 
WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE MOMENT THE 
BRITISH AND THEIR AFGHAN MILITARY 
ALLIES ARE TRYING TO INCREASE THE 
AREA UNDER THEIR EFFECTIVE CONTROL 
BY BUILDING NEW BASES AND POSITIONS 
FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT BUT OF 
COURSE THE TALEBAN DON'T LIKE THAT 
AT ALL 
WHAT WE WANT IS PROTECTIVE 
ACCOMMODATION FOR A SECTION OF 
PEOPLE 
BACK FROM THEIR VISIT PEOPLE MAJOR DAVE KENNY AND THE OTHERS 
MEET TO DECIDE WHETHER ANYTHING CAN 
BE DONE TO MOVE THE NEW BASE AND 
WHETHER THEY SHOULD WORK TOGETHER 
WITH PLANNED AFGHAN POLICE AND ARMY 
POSTS 
I WOULD NOT PUT THEM IN THE POSTS SAME ACCOMMODATION AT THE MOMENT L. 
DON'T THINK THEY ARE READY FOR THAT 
CIVILIANS ARE THERE TOO A 
STABILISATION ADVISER DISPATCHED 
FROM WHITEHALL TO BOOST THE NON 
MILITARY SIDE OF THIS EFFORT N. ON A DAILY BASIS PEOPLE COMING HERE 
SAYING WHAT ABOUT THE 
ACCOMMODATION 
TWILIGHT IS THE TALEBAN'S FAVOURITE 
TIME FOR ACTION 
NEWS COMES IN OF A CONTACT BREAKING 
UP A MEETING 
MAJOR DAVE KENNY'S MEN AND THE 
AFGHAN SOLDIERS WE VISITED EARLIER 
ARE UNDER ATTACK 
CONFIRM WHAT YOU ARE ENGAGING 
OVER 
IT IS DARK OUTSIDE BUT OVER SOME TROOPS ARE REQUESTING 
PERMISSION TO ENGAGE AFGHANS THEY 
CAN SEE 
BECAUSE THEY ARE UNABLE TO 
POSITIVELY IDENTIFY MEN WITH 
WEAPONS PERMISSION IS REFUSED 
IT TAKES NEARLY TEN MINUTES TO GET 
MORTARS TO FIRE ELIMINATING ROUNDS 
AND IN THAT TIME THE ENEMY HAS 
MELTED BACK INTO THE DARKNESS 
ILLUMINATING THIS IS QUITE 
DIFFERENT TO THE HEAD ON 
CONFRONTATIONS OF TWO THOUSAND SIX BUT IT IS 
CLASSIC GUERRILLA WARFARE 
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO TODAY IS TO 
HEAR YOUR VIEWS OF THE RECENT 
TALEBAN ACTIVITY 
THE WEEKLY SECURITY COUNCIL IS 
CONVENED THE LOCAL SECURITY 
COMMANDERS NEED TO AGREE TO THE 
IDEA FOR THE NEW BASE 
SATELLITE STATION NORTH WHICH IS 
BEING CONSTRUCTED NOW IT'S MOVING 
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE 
THESE AFGHAN PARTNERS ARE VITAL TO 
THE BRITISH PLAN HERE BUT NOBODY 
KNOWS HOW FAR LOCAL POWER BROKERS 
COMMUNE QUAIT THEIR TALIBAN 
NEIGHBOURS OR WHETHER THEY MIGHT BE 
KEEPING THEIR OPTIONS OPEN 
THE TALIBAN DIDN'T ASK ME TO CHANGE THEM THEY SAID I HAVE 
TO GET OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT THEY 
SAID THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE OVER 
THE COUNTRY AND FIGHT AGAINST THE 
NATIONAL ARMY AND THE FOREIGNERS 
THEY ASKED ME BEFORE TO JOIN THEM 
BUT I REFUSE 
EVENING AND THE IRISH RANGERS GET A 
COMMUNAL MEAL GOING THE DINNER 
DINNER TIME ROUTINE IS SOMETIMES 
INTERRUPTED INTERRUPTED CHANNEL ONE 
WHEN ROCKETS ARE FIRED NEAR THE 
BASE THE SOLDIERS STAND TO 
WAS THAT A CHINESE ROCKET 
WE WERE 
SITTING DOWN HAVING A DISCUSSION A 
BIT OF BANTER LIKE WE NORMALLY DO 
WE HEARD WHIZZING WHICH WE THOUGHT 
WAS A ROCKET THEN EVERYONE GOT THE 
BODY ARMOUR AND WEAPONS TOGETHER 
AND STAND TO WE HEARD THE SIREN SO 
SOMETHING HAD GONE OFF 
SATURDAY MORNING AND SOME FARMERS 
LIVING AROUND THE NEW PATROL BASE 
TURN UP ASKING FOR COMPENSATION 
TWO GET AN IMMEDIATE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
SOLDIERS ARE MOVING INTO THEIR 
HOMES 
THE OTHER THREE BARGIN WORRIED 
THAT THE NEW BASE WILL PUT THEM IN 
THE FIRING LINE 
THE TWO COMPOUND OWNERS RIGHT NEXT 
TO THE NEW BUILD THEY SHOULD GET 
SLIGHTLY MORE OF A GOODWILL PAYMENT 
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH IS AGREED THESE 
NEGOTIATIONS AND THE CO OPERATION 
OF THE TOWN COUNCIL ARE SIGNS OF 
SOME PROGRESS 
WE ARE STARTING TO 
GENERATE SOME FORM OF LOCAL 
OWNERSHIP OVER THE STABILISATION 
PROCESS WE HAVE A DISTRICT GOVERNOR 
INSTALLED AN EXECUTIVE SUREER WHO 
ARE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND 
ARBITRATE WITH THE POPULATION 
SECONDLY WE ALSO HAVE SOME FORM OF 
GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATION WE ARE 
TRYING TO ENCOURAGE GOVERNMENT IN 
KABUL TO SET UP SHOP AS IT WERE 
IN THE BATTLE FOR ALLEGIANCES HERE 
THE TALIBAN BROADCAST TO EVERYONE 
INCLUDING THE AFGHAN OFFICERS OFTEN 
LISTENING IN TO THEIR 
COMMUNICATIONS THE CHATTER PROMISE 
AS MAJOR UPSURGE OF ACTIVITY AS THE 
POPPY HARVEST COMES IN SOON THE 
TALIBAN ARE FAR FROM SPENT FORCE 
LOCAL PEOPLE KNOW IT 
WE ARE STILL 
LOOKED UPON AS PERHAPS THE OUTSIDER 
MAYBE THE ENEMY FOR MANY IT'S NOT 
GOING TO BE A QUICK PROCESS 
CHANGING THAT L. THINK IF YOU COME 
FROM THIS PART OF AFGHANISTAN THIS 
PART OF HELMAND THIS IS TALIBAN 
THIS IS TALIBAN COUNTRY MONDAY MONDAY AFGHAN SOLDIERS MOVE INTO THE 
HOMELY SURROUNDINGS OF ONE OF THE 
COMPOUND'S VACATED NEAR THEIR NEW 
PATROL BASE 
THE ROYAL IRISH REGIMENT MEN TORS 
ENTER THE DUSTY SURROUNDINGS OF 
THEIR NEW BUILD MITT THEY ARE 
UNDER NO ILLUSIONS 
THE 
DIFFICULTY OF THEIR MISSION HERE 
TRYING TO PUSH SECURITY FORWARD 
METRE BY METRE FOR RANGER PHILLIP 
GILLESPIE THE SACRIFICE OF HIS 
FRIENDS HERE TWO YEARS AGO HAS MADE 
THIS CONFLICT VERY PERSONAL 
I LOST THREE GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE 
OUT HERE LAST TIME L. CAME BACK FOR 
MYSELF BUT DEFINITELY AS WELL FOR 
THEM GUYS BECAUSE THERE IS 
DEFINITELY ONE OWED SO THERE IS I 
LIKE MY JOB I REALLY DO THE ARMY 
IS GREAT SO IT IS I WANTED TO 
COME OUT HERE AND GET THEM BACK TO 
BE HONEST 
MANY VETERANS OF THE TWO THOUSAND SIX FIGHTING 
HAVE BEEN FLOWN IN TO HELMAND IN 
RECENT WEEKS AS PART OF THE ARMY 
SIX MONTHLY TROOP ROTATION CHINOOK HELICOPTERS 
IN 
CHINOOK HELICOPTERS FERRY IN SUPPLIES MOST DAYS THE MORE THE 
TALIBAN RESORT TO HIT OR RUN 
ATTACKS OR ROADSIDE BOMBS THE MORE 
DEPENDANT THE ARMY BECOMES ON THE 
CHINOOKS 
FOR THE ROYAL IRISH RANGERS BASED 
HERE THEY PROVIDE ALL MANNER OF 
SUPPLIES AND THE LINK WITH HOME PAY SLIPS ARE NOT ALWAYS WELCOME 
I WOULDN'T EVEN GET OUT OF BED FOR 
EIGHT HUNDRED 
BACK AT THE NEW PATROL ASE EIGHT HUNDRED AND REINFORCEMENTS ARE IN FOR AN 
OPERATION THEY WILL ADVANCE FOR 
TWO KILOMETERS TO THE NORTH A SHOW 
OF FORCE INTO TALIBAN TERRITORY 
TUESDAY THE HOUR FOR THE OPERATION 
APPROACHES 
WE WILL BE MOVING NORTH APPROACHES THE OFFICER LEADING IT GIVES HIS 
FINAL BRIEFING 
TO THE WEST OF THE 
MAIN URBANISED AREA IS ROUTE BLACK 
AT LAST WE ARE ON OUR WAY 
THE RECEPTION SEEMS FRIENDLY ENOUGH 
AT FIRST MORE SO THAN IT WAS IN 
THE BIZARRE 
BUT THE SENSE IS ALWAYS THERE OF AN 
ENEMY OBJECT SERVING BIDING HIS 
TIME 
THEY ARE WATCHING OUR MOVES TIME AS WE MOVE ALONG WHEN THE LOCALS 
APPROACH THEY WILL TELL US IF THERE 
IS SOMETHING AHEAD OF US THAT IS A 
GOOD RELIABLE SIGN OF INTELLIGENCE 
FOR US 
THEIR AIR CONTROLLER FINDS 
SOLACE FROM AN UGLY CALL SIGN A 
GUNSHIP HELICOPTER THAT HAS ITS OWN 
CHIC PILOT SEXY VOICE MAN RANGER GILLESPIE HAS PICKED UP AN 
AFGHANISTAN PHRASE THE SHARK IN 
THE SKY 
THE SHARK IN THE SKY WHEN 
THE SHARK IS IN THE SKY THEY DON'T 
COME OUT 
AS WE PUSH AHEAD THE AFGHAN COMPANY 
COMMANDER GLEANS MUCH FROM LOCAL 
PEOPLE THE TALIBAN HAVE MOVED AWAY 
ONE YOUTH IS ARRESTED ACCUSED OF 
TIPPING OFF TWO GUERRILLAS BEFORE 
WE ARRIVED 
THE PATROL STOP AS COUPLE OF 
KILOMETERS FORWARD OF ITS NEW BASE 
IT HAS MADE ITS POINT 
THIS IS 
REALLY PRETTY MUCH THE LIMIT OF 
WHERE WE WILL GO TODAY IN 
PATROLLING TERMS IT REPRESENTS THE 
EXTENT REALLY OF HOW FAR TALIBAN 
TERRITORY HAS BEEN BITTERN INTO BY 
BRITISH TROOPS IN THIS AREA 
CLEARLY TODAY THE PRESENCE OF THE 
HELICOPTER AND VERY LARGE NUMBERS 
OF TROOPS HERE HAS KEPT THEM AT 
CHECK SO FAR AT LEAST L. THINK 
EVERYBODY IS WONDERING WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN AFTER THE POPPY WHICH 
SURROUNDS US HERE IS HARVESTED AND 
THE TALIBAN HAVE MORE MONEY IN 
THEIR POCKETS 
OUR JOURNEY BACK TAKES US ONCE MORE 
THROUGH FIELD AFTER FIELD OF POPPY 
BRITAIN'S PLAN IS TO RELY MORE ON 
THE AFGHANS THE AFGHANS RELY SO 
MUCH HERE ON OPIUM ITS INFLUENCE 
MUST PERMEATE EVERYWHERE POPPY POPPY GROWS OUT HERE LIKE GRASS IF THEY 
DON'T SORT OUT THAT SIDE OF IT THAT 
WILL FUND THE TERRORIST THE 
TALIBAN IT WILL BE A NEVER ENDING 
CYCLE 
AS THE PATROL NEARS ITS BASE CYCLE THERE IS SATISFACTION THAT THEY 
HAVE MADE THEIR PRESENCE FELT IN 
DISPUTED TERRITORY 
SOMETHING LIKE TWO HUNDRED BRITISH AND 
AFGHAN TROOPS HAVE BEEN OUT ON THE 
OPERATION THE TALIBAN HAVE DONE 
WHAT WISE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS DO 
WAIT FOR A MOMENT WHEN THE ODDS ARE 
BETTER 
IT'S TIME TO TAKE STOCK FOR MANY 
SOLDIERS SERVING THIS IS THEIR 
SECOND TOUR OF HELMAND FEW IMAGINE 
EITHER THAT IT WILL BE THEIR LAST 
OR THAT THEY CAN EXPECT TO SEE 
RAPID PROGRESS 
SOMEONE QUESTIONED IN THE MEDIA IT 
WOULD BE MEASURED IN DECADES NOT 
YEARS OUR COMMITMENT TO 
AFGHANISTAN AS IT HAS BEEN IN 
OTHER COUNTRIES NOTIBLY BOSNIA WE 
WERE THERE FOR AT LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS 
FEEL CERTAIN WE WILL BE THAT I 
WILL BE BACK IN AFGHANISTAN AGAIN 
JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT SORT OF ROLE 
WE WILL BE DOING THEN MUCH I HOPE 
THAT IT WON'T BE IN QUITE A 
CONNECTIC ROLE THAT QUITE A LOT OF 
BRITISH ARMY IS INVOLVED WITH 
TASKED WITH HELMAND AT THE MOMENT 
IN MY VIEW NOT MANY HEARTS AND 
MINDS HAVE BEEN WON HERE MOST 
PEOPLE ARE STILL WAITING TO SEE 
WHAT THE TALIBAN WILL DO AFTER THE 
HARVEST WHEN THEY HAVE MONEY AND 
MUCH MORE POWER AND DESPITE THE 
TALK ABOUT DELIVERING MORE NON 
MILITARY CIVILIAN AID 
RECONSTRUCTION AND ALL THE REST OF 
IT HERE IT IS STILL THE CASE THAT 
THE BRITISH AND NATO EFFORT IS VERY 
MUCH GEARED TOWARDS SECURITY AND 
MILITARY OPERATIONS 
WE ARE OUT OF MUSSA CALAIS FOR NOW 
ANY WAY FLYING SAFELY ABOVE THE 
ROADSIDE BOMBS BUT THE TOWN WILL 
BE PIVOTAL IN THE STRUGGLE FOR 
HELMAND INLET MONTHS AHEAD WITH ITS 
NEW TACTICS THE TALIBAN CAN 
CONTINUE TO DAMAGE THE BRITISH AT 
FAR LOWER COST TO THEM SELVES AS 
FOR THE BRITISH IT'S A MATTER OF 
HOW MUCH PAIN THEY ARE WILLING TO 
BEAR IN ORDER TO TRY AND WIN OVER 
THE LAND AND PEOPLE BELOW MARK 
URBAN REPORTING WE HAVE TWO MORE 
FILMS IN OUR FRONT LINE AFGHANISTAN 
SERIES NEXT WEEK WE IMMEDIATE 
SUICIDE BOMBERS SENT FROM PAKISTAN 
TO KILL IN AFGHANISTAN HE REVEALS 
NEW DETAILS OF THE SECRET WAR TO 
COUNTER THEM WE ALMOST BECAME PART 
OF A SUICIDE BOMBING OURSELVES 
BECAUSE A FEW MOMENTS AGO AS WE 
WERE COMING UP THIS ROAD WE 
NOTICED A COMOTION AND IN FACT A 
MAN COMMOTIONS A MAN IN A 
SUICIDE BOMBING VEST HAD BEEN 
OVERPOWERED 
THIS KID CAME IN WITH A BULLET 
WOUND IN HIS HEAD AS I WAS 
ADJUSTING HIS BANDAGES MY HAND WENT 
INTO HIS BRAIN 
THAT IS COMING UP NEXT WEEK THEY 
CALL THEM THE RYANAIR GENERATION 
THEY ARE CHANGING THE PICTURE OF 
IMMIGRATION NEW EUROPEAN MIGRANTS 
MAINLY POLES WHO COME TO THIS 
COUNTRY TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK AND 
HEAD HOME WHEN THEY START TO MISS 
IT WHAT IMPACT ARE THEY HAVING ON 
BRITAIN CAN WE QUANTIFY IMMIGRATION 
NUMBERS WHEN WORK PERMITS ARE FLUID 
A NEW STUDY BY THE IPPR DUE OUT 
TOMORROW SUGGESTS A MILLION HAVE 
COME HERE SINCE BORDERS OPENED IN 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR HALF A MILLION OF THOSE HAVE 
ALREADY RETURNED ALREADY RETURNED HOME 
FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS ANECDOTAL 
EVERYONE KNEW A POLISH PLUMBER OR A 
NEW DEL KA TESANT A WAVE OF 
IMMIGRATION HAD CREPT UP ON US 
UNAWARES THE GOVERNMENT WAS 
DERIDED FOR HAVING PREDICTED THAT 
THE POPULATION WOULD INCREASE BY 
THIRTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE 
EAST WARD EXPANSION OF THE E. U. NO 
ONE KNEW THE REAL FIGURES THE IPPR 
SAYS IT HAS PRODUCED THE MOST 
DEFINITIVE PICTURE WE WILL HAVE IT 
ESTIMATES A MILLION WORKERS ARRIVED 
IN THE U. K. BETWEEN MARCH TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND 
DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SURPRISING 
RESULTS RESULTS POLAND'S TWO MOST POPULAR BEERS 
HARDLY KNOWN IN THE U. K. BEFORE TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
ARE CONSUMED HERE AT THE RATE OF FORTY FOUR 
MILLION PINTS A THEY FANNED 
OUT WIDER THAN ANY INCOMERS SINCE 
THE ANGLO SAXONS TWO AND A HALF 
YEARS AGO NEWSNIGHT FOUND THEY GOT 
OFF IN A TOWN WHERE MOST PEOPLE 
ONLY CHANGE CREWE 
FOR ADAM KOLASINSKI ONE OF THREE THOUSAND 
NEW ARRIVALS IN A TOWN OF FIFTY THOUSAND 
LIFE IN SOUTH CHESS HRSHIRE WAS THE 
ANSWER TO HIS PRAYERS HE HAD TO GO 
FROM COMPUTING TO MAKING PIZZAS 
I I I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR WORK FOR 
THREE MONTHS WITHOUT ANY RESULTS L. 
WAS SEARCHING IN POLAND L. SENT ONE 
APPLICATION TO ENGLAND ALMOST BY 
ACCIDENT THAT WAS THE ONLY PLACE I 
GOT A POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM THE THE INCOMERS WERE WELCOMED THEY DID 
JOBS NO ONE ELSE WOULD IN CATERING 
FOOD PROCESSING AND OTHER 
INDUSTRIES THEY WERE POLITICAL 
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
THE INFLUX OF EAST EUROPEANS HAS 
REIGNITED THE DEBATE ON IMMIGRATION 
FOR TWO PARTICULAR REASONS IT 
AFFECTED MANY AREAS THAT HAD RARELY 
SEEN IMMIGRANTS BEFORE BECAUSE 
MOST EAST EUROPEANS ARE WHITE IT 
HAS ENABLED PEOPLE TO DISCUSS 
IMMIGRATION WITHOUT FEARING THEY 
MIGHT BE ACCUSED OF RACISM FOUR 
YEARS ON THE WAVE HAS PEAKED THE 
IPPR FOUND THAT WILL ARRIVALS ARE 
TAILING OFF HALF OF ALL THOSE WHO 
CAME HAVE ALREADY GONE BACK 
SOME ARE TEMPTED BACK BY EXPANDING 
ECONOMIES AT HOME FAR EAST EARN 
INVESTMENTS FOR EXAMPLE WILL CREATE 
THOUSANDS OF HIGHLY SKILLED JOBS 
AND NEW SITES LIKE THIS IN POLAND 
AS THE LOCAL CURRENCY GAINS VALUE 
AGAINST THE POUND MONEY SENT HOME 
FROM BRITAIN IS WORTH FAR LESS 
IN A LEAFY SUBURB OF SOUTH LONDON 
ONE YOUNG POLE WHO ARRIVED THREE 
YEARS AGO TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE HERE 
WAS PACKING UP HIS LIFE AGAIN TODAY 
TO TRY HIS LUCK BACK HOME WE 
HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED HIM BECAUSE HE 
HAS NOT TOLD THE CITY FIRM THAT HE 
WORKS IN IT HE IS GOING IF HE 
DOESN'T FIND A JOB IN POLAND HE 
WILL BE BACK AFTER A SHORT HOLIDAY 
HIS WIFE HAS GONE TAKING HIS YOUNG 
SON AND HE WANTS TO BE WITH HER 
SHE MISSES HER FAMILY SHE GOT 
QUITE GOOD RELATION WITH HER 
SISTERS AND PARENTS BASICALLY 
WE'VE GOT ALSO REALLY NICE JOB 
OPPORTUNITIES UP THERE SHE CAME 
BACK AFTER AFTER THREE WEEKS YOU 
GET REALLY NICE JOB 
RIGHT NOW I'M NOT BEING BOMBARDED 
BUT LET'S SAY I'VE GOT POSSIBILITY 
TO FIND DECENT JOB FOR ME RIGHT 
NOW IT'S JUST CASE OF TIME TO FIND 
SOMETHING WHICH WILL BE MUCH MORE 
SPECTACULAR EVEN THAN WHAT I'M 
DOING HERE 
PROPORTION OF THE 
SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND EAST EUROPEANS NOW HERE 
WILL STAY PERMANENTLY THEY WILL 
INCLUDE ADAM KOLASINSKI AND HIS 
FAMILY IN CREWE AFTER FOUR YEARS 
HIS WAGE HAS GONE UP FROM FIVE POINT TWO FIVE TO 
EIGHT POINT FOUR FOUR AND HE IS BUYING HIS FIRST 
HOUSE IN SOME PARTS OF BRITAIN 
EMPLOYERS MAY BE BEGINNING TO WORRY 
ABOUT LOSING CHEAP LABOUR ADAM 
SAYS THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF POLES 
HE WORKS AND HIS BRITISH 
DREAM IS NOT OVER YET 
BACALAUREATE BY POPULAR DEMAND ARE 
DANNY SRISKANDARAJAH FROM THE IPPR 
AND SIR ANDREW GREEN OF MIGRATION 
WATCH U. K. WELCOME TO YOU BOTH 
THE SCALE OF THE IMMIGRATION THAT 
HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FOUR 
YEARS AND IT IS CLEARLY STAGGERING 
ONE MILLION PEOPLE OVER FOUR YEARS 
BUT THE POINT IS THAT JUST AS WE 
ARE COMING TO TERMS WITH THAT 
IMMIGRATION I THINK WE RISK 
LOSING SITE OF THE FACT THAT WE MAY 
HAVE SEEN THE FLOODGATES OPEN BUT 
WE ARE SEEING TURNSTILES THAT 
RETURN MIGRATION AMONGST THESE 
PEOPLE HALF HAVE GONE BACK AND 
BEFORE WE KNOW IT MANY OF THOSE 
POLES WHO ARE DOING THE JOBS THAT 
WE HAVE GOT USED TO MAY DISAPPEAR 
WE KNOW WHERE YOU STAND THIS IS 
WHAT YOU ARE EMPHASISING THAT HALF 
OF THEM ARE GOING IS THAT THE 
MESSAGE YOU WANT TO PUT ACROSS 
THAT'S ONE OF THE MESSAGE WE ARE 
SEEING A DIFFERENT TYPE OF MI 
GRAILTION THE A MIGRATION THE 
ASSUMPTION IS THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE 
HERE AND THEY BRING THEIR FAMILIES 
AND THEY SETTLE FOREVER THINK WE 
ARE SEEING SUPER MOBILITY A LOT 
MORE FLUID MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE 
SIR ANDREW IT IS NOT A 
CONVENTIONAL VIEW OF MIGRATION IT 
IS NOT PEOPLE SNEAKING IN THE DOOR 
AND STAYING THERE THEY ARE POPPING 
OVER AND MAKING MONEY LIKE YOU 
MIGHT MOVE BETWEEN CITIES AND THE 
U. K. AND THEY ARE GOING BACK AGAIN 
THAT'S BECOMING TRUE OF EAST 
EUROPEANS THERE ARE ONLY ONE OF 
FIVE OF FOREIGN MIGRANTS MOST OF 
THEM TEND TO STAY 
I AGREE WITH THE CONCLUSION THEY 
ARE RIGHT AND EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT 
BUT FOR A WIDER REASON AND THE 
REASON IS THIS AS PEOPLE STARTING 
TO HOME THEY WILL COUNTERBALANCE 
THOSE WHO ARE COMING IN AND IT WILL 
COME INTO BALANCE AND WE WILL BE IN 
THE SAME SITUATION AS WE ARE WITH 
POLES AS WE ARE WITH GERMANS AND 
FRENCH FRENCH EXCEPT SOME OF THE POINTS THE THE REALLY SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT 
POINT IS THIS THOSE WHO MAY THERE 
IS NO POINT IN IMMIGRATION CONTROL 
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CONTROL EUROPEANS 
HAVE GOT IT WRONG 
THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT WILL COME 
INTO BALANCE AND THE PEOPLE FROM 
OUTSIDE THE EUROPE WHO YOU CAN 
CONTROL TB CONTROLLED AND SHOULD BE 
I WANT TO STICK TO THIS POINT WHICH 
IS IF THE REPORT IS CORRECT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT IMPROVED ECONOMIC 
CONDITIONS BRITAIN STOPS BECOMING 
AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO COME TO IF 
POLAND IS BETTER AND IF OUR OWN 
POUND IS WEAKER THAT IS GOING TO 
BALANCE OUT 
YES PRECISELY IT IS A BIG SUCCESS 
ECONOMICALLY IN BRINGING UP SO SO YOU WILL CROSS IT OFF THE LIST THE THE EUROPEAN MIGRATION DOESN'T MATTER 
BECAUSE IT WILL BALANCE OUT WHAT 
DOES MATTER IS THE MIGRATION FROM 
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE YOU 
HAVE HUGE NUMBERS OF YOUNG PEOPLE 
WITH NO JOBS VERY GREAT PRESSURE 
TO COME HERE PEOPLE WHO DO STAY 
SO IN A SENSE YOU MISSED THE POINT 
THIS SURVEY DOESN'T COVER ANYTHING 
BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A 
FLEXIBLE SENSE OF IMMIGRATION FROM 
EASTERN EUROPEAN S. N. P. 
I FIND IT SAD 
HERE WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF SOMETHING 
DIFFERENT GOING ON AND SIR ANDREW 
RESORTS IT TALKING ABOUT A TWENTIETH 
CENTURY STYLE MIGRATION ABOUT THIRD 
WORLD MIGRANTS 
I AM AGREEING WITH YOU 
IF EUROPE 
ISN'T A PROBLEM IT DOESN'T MEAN 
THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM HAS GONE 
AWAY AWAY I THINK IF WE SCRATCHED THE SURFACE 
ABOUT ALL THE MIGRATION WE ARE 
SEEING AROUND THE WORLD OR 
AMERICANS GOING ELSEWHERE FOR A FEW 
YEARS WE ARE SEEING PATTERNS OF OF 
MOCT THAT ARE MOCT THAT ARE 
DIFFERENT SOME OF OF THOSE PEOPLE 
BELIEVE THAT SOMEHOW THERE IS A 
CATEGORY OF IMMIGRANTS HE TALKS 
ABOUT THIRD WORLD IMMIGRANTS WHO 
ARE DIFFERENT WHO BEHAVE 
DIFFERENTLY DIFFERENTLY IF YOU LOOK AT IT ROUGHLY EIGHTY PER CENT OF 
PEOPLE FROM THE THIRD WORLD WHO 
COME HERE AS IMMIGRANTS STAY TWENTY PER CENT 
OF PEOPLE FROM SAY AMERICA AND SO 
ON STAY THAT'S A FACT 
THE CULTURAL CULTURAL CHANGES ARE 
STILL GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT HERE 
WELL THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
SIGNIFICANT WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE IS MIGRATION BROUGHT INTO 
BALANCE SO THAT THE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE COMING IS ABOUT THE SAME AS 
THE NUMBER OF LEAVING THAT WILL 
TAKE THE PROSHURE OFF PRESSURE 
OFF OUR POPULATION THE PRESSURE OF 
HOUSING AND PUBLIC SERVICES 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT PRESSURE OFF 
WHERE THE JOBS HAVE BEEN FILLED 
THEY SAY THAT WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY 
ILLITERATE ILLITERATE BUT IN TERMS OF THE JOBS FILLED 
THERE WILL ABGAP 
WELL WHAT THEY 
SAID WAS THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO 
THE RESIDENT POPULATION WAS NOT 
SIGNIFICANT CERTAINLY SOME 
EMPLOYERS WILL FEEL IT BECAUSE 
THEY WILL LOSE CHEAP LABOUR BUT IN 
A WELFARE STATE THERE IS NO SUCH 
THING AS CHEAP LABOUR 
DANNY THE LAST TIME WE MET WE WERE 
TALK BEING MEDIA INTERPRETATIONS OF 
THIS STORY HERE WE ARE ON THE EVE 
OF YOUR REPORT BEING PUBLISHED 
WHAT IS YOUR ANTICIPATION OF THE 
HEADLINE TOMORROW L. WOULD LIKE 
THIS FROM BOTH YOU AS A WAY TO END 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE HEADLINE WILL 
BE ON THIS 
THERE WILL ABLOT OF 
TALK ABOUT HOW WRONG THE GOVERNMENT 
GOT THE ESTIMATE AMIDST THE 
COVERAGE WE WILL SEE THE REAL 
REALISATION THAT WE WILL SEE 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND TALKING 
ABOUT MATCHING THE NUMBERS IN 
MATCHING THE NUMBERS OUT 
CAN WE DO HEADLINE 
IN ANSWER TO 
YOUR QUESTION THE GOVERNMENT WRONG 
BY A FACTOR OF TEN HE IS RIGHT ON 
THAT BUT ALSO I HOPE THEY WILL SAY 
THIS SHOWS THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT 
EUROPEAN IMMIGRATION IF THERE IS A 
PROBLEM AND WE THINK THERE IS THEN

POLITICIAN TO TALK TO USMENT 
TONIGHT I AM JOINED BY THE 
CONSERVATIVE'S ELECTION STRATEGIST 
ERIC PICKLES 
HERE IS OUR GUIDE TO HOW THE LOCAL 
ELECTION BATTLEGROUND LOOKS FOR THE 
TORIES 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE LAST LOCAL ELECTIONS IN 
WHICH THIS YEAR'S SEATS WERE FOUGHT 
THE CONSERVATIVES REACHED HIGH 
WATER MARK SO THEY CLAIM THIS TIME 
AROUND A NET GAIN OF ANYTHING MORE 
THAN ONE HUNDRED COUNCILLORS WOULD BE A 
CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION IN 
GEOGRAPHICAL TERMS THE 
CONSERVATIVES NEED TO MAKE GAINS IN 
URBAN AND NORTHERN AREAS WHERE THEY 
ARE WEAK 
COUNCILS WHERE THEY WANT TO BE SEEN 
TO BE MAKING STRIDES ARE BIRMINGHAM 
BURY AND WOLVERHAMPTON 
AND IN THE SOUTH MAIDSTONE 
READING AND SOUTHAMPTON 
AND THEY WANT BORIS TO BE MAYOR IN 
LONDON HOW TO TRANSLATE LOCAL 
ELECTION INTO A COUNTRYWIDE PICTURE 
ELECTION INTO A COUNTRYWIDE PICTURE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE CONSERVATIVES SHARE WAS 
THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT TWELVE PER CENT AHEAD OF LABOUR THEY WENT 
ON TO LOSE THE GENERAL ELECTION 
YEAR LATER 
IN THE LAST TWO LOCAL ELECTION THEY 
HAVE ACHIEVED FORTY PER CENT WHICH WOULD BE IN 
LINE WITH OPINION POLLS THEY WILL 
WANT TO ACHIEVE A PROJECTED SHARE 
OF FORTY PER CENT THIS TIME TO BE IN 
POLL POLL POSITION TO WIN GENERAL ELECTION ELECTION WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THEY ARE 
CAMPAIGNING ON IT IS THE 
ENVIRONMENT WILL THEIR VOTE BLUE 
GO GREEN SLOGAN TRANSLATE INTO 
VOTES IN THE HEARTLANDS OF THE 
NORTH AND URBAN AREAS THEIR TEST 
TEST WILL BORIS JOHNSON BE ACCEPTED 
AS THE FIRST CONSERVATIVE MAYOR OF 
LONDON 
ERIC PICKLES IS THE SHADOW LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT MINISTER THANK YOU 
FOR JOINING US 
PLEASURE PLEASURE IF THE POLLS ARE RIGHT YOU ARE IN 
A GREAT POSITION YOU SHOULD BE 
DOING FANTASTICALLY WELL ON 
THURSDAY HOW MANY COUNCILLORS IS 
THAT 
GORDON BROWN IS A LUCKY MAN THAT BECAUSE THIS IS A TINY SET OF THAT 
ELECTIONS THERE WILL THERE WILL 
ONLY BE SHORT OF THREE THOUSAND SEATS UP IN 
ENGLAND LAST YEAR IT WAS ELEVEN THOUSAND 
RELATIVELY MODEST GAINS OF EIGHTY TO 
ONE HUNDRED WOULD BE AN ACHIEVEMENT 
EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED 
YES WHEN I STARTED 
PLANNING THIS A YEAR AGO PLEASE 
DON'T LAUGH AT ME I WORKT ON THE 
ASSUMPTION THAT LABOUR WOULD BE 
HAVING NET GAINS OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED 
THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION 
WILLIAM HAGUE IS TALKING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED 
GAINS YOU SAY YOU WILL BE 
SATISFIED WITH EIGHTY 
TWO HUNDRED GAINS WILLIAM HAS NOT SAID TWO HUNDRED 
GAINS GAINS LET'S EXAMINE WHAT TWO HUNDRED GAINS MEANS 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THAT WAS LABOUR'S WORST 
ELECTION DEFEAT TWO HUNDRED REPRESENTS 
OVER A QUARTER OF THE SEATS THEY 
ARE DEFENDING THAT WOULD BE MELT 
MELT DOWN FOR THEM 
WHAT SHARE WHAT PROJECTED SHARE OF 
THE NATIONAL NATIONAL VOTE ARE YOU 
AIMING FOR THIS TIME 
I DON'T 
DEMERE FROM YOU IN ANYWAY IT WILL 
BE FORTY EVEN ABOVE FORTY PER CENT 
YOU THINK AROUND FORTY PER CENT 
YES AROUND 
FORTY PER CENT MAYBE HIGHER 
LAST YEAR IT WAS FORTY PER CENT AND THE YEAR 
BEFORE IT WAS ABOVE FORTY PER CENT AND NOW WE 
ARE LOOKING AT LABOUR AT THEIR 
LOWEST EBB FOR YEARS THEY ARE MOST 
UNPOPULAR FOR YEARS AND YOU DON'T 
THINK YOU CAN DO BETTER 
THE YEAR 
BEFORE IT WAS PER CENT AND LAST YEAR IT WAS 
THIRTY NINE PER CENT THIRTY NINE PER CENT YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT AT THE TIME IT 
WAS FORTY PERCENT 
YOU CORRECTED US 
WHAT I SAID THIS EVENING I I THINK 
IT WILL BE ABOVE FORTY PER CENT 
HOW ABOVE FORTY PER CENT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I THINK IT WILL 
BE ABOVE FORTY 
I'M NOT GOING TO GET MUCH FROM YOU 
I AM HERE TO TWO 
THE POSITION LABOUR WERE IN TWO 
YEARS BEFORE THEIR LANDSLIDE 
VICTORY THEY HAD NINETY SEVEN PER CENT EITHER YOU 
ARE YOU ARE TRYING TO DOWNGRADE 
EXPECTATIONS OR DO YOU BELIEVE YOU 
WILL GET ABOVE FORTY YOU ARE IN 
TROUBLE 
A COUPLE OF THINGS ARE TROUBLE DIFFERENT TEN YEARS AGO WHAT WE 
WOULD CALL THE OTHERS PEOPLE LIKE 
BRITISH NATIONAL PARTY U. KIP A 
REVIVAL IN THE RESIDENTS IT IS 
DIFFICULT FOR A PARTY TO GET FORTY SEVEN PER CENT 
PARTICULARLY WHEN THE VOTING SYSTEM 
NOW ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES SMALLER 
PARTIES PARTIES YOU CAN SEE THAT LABOUR IS IN 
TROUBLE AND YET YOU ARE FAILING TO 
CAPITALISE PEOPLE AREN'T TURNING 
TO THE TORIES AS THEIR SALVATION 
IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD NIGHT FOR 
US ON THURSDAY NIGHT YES THEY DID 
GET FORTY PER CENT ONLY FOR A BRIEF PERIOD 
BUT EVEN I I ARE NOT SUGGESTING IF 
THERE WAS AN ELECTION TOMORROW WE 
WOULD HAVE A MAJORITY OF TWO HUNDRED 
YOU CAN TALKING TO PEOPLE YOU ARE 
KNOCKING ON DOORS 
WHEN PEOPLE ANSWER THE DOOR AND SAY 
WHAT CAN THE TORIES DO FOR ME 
THAT'S YOUR ANSWER GENERALLY GENERALLY SPEAKING BEFORE WE GET TO THAT 
POINT WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEM 
SAYING HOW BAD LABOUR HAS BEEN AND 
HOW MUCH THE PRIME MINISTER 
BETRAYED THEM OVER TEN PENCE 
A PROTEST VOTE IS VERY WELL 
OUR COUNCILS HAVE A BETTER RECORD 
OF KEEPING STREETS CLEAN OF HAVE A 
BETTER RECORD OF RECYCLING OUR 
STREETS ARE ARE SAFER AND OUR 
COUNCIL TAX IS A LOT LOWER THAN 
EITHER THE LABOUR OR THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS THAT'S IN THE A BAD 
RECORD TO FIGHT ON 
WHY DOESN'T ANYONE IN LIVERPOOL IN 
GATES HEAD IN NEWCASTLE SEEM TO 
BELIEVE THAT LOOK 
YOU WERE LOOK LEADINGER OF BRADFORD COUNCIL 
DURING THE LAST TORY GOVERNMENT AND 
YOU CAN'T GET CONTROL OF THAT IF 
YOU CAN'T GET CONTROL OF THAT 
WHERE ARE YOU 
THE CONSERVATIVES 
ARE LEADING BRADFORD COUNCIL NOW 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE IN IN THE NORTH 
OF ENGLAND WE WILL DO VERY WELL IN 
NORTH TYNESIDE WE HAVE TRACTION IN 
SUNDERLAND WE WILL HAVE A 
REASONABLE NUMBER OF COUNCILLORS 
YOU LOOK ACROSS THE NORTH WEST 
AROUND MANCHESTER THE BOLTONS WE 
ARE DOING THE TRAFFORDS WE ARE WE 
ARE DOING WELL AND FOR THE FIRST 
TIME EVER WE MANAGED TO PUT 
CANDIDATES ONE PER CENT INN YORKSHIRE AND WE 
ARE FIELDING MORE CANDIDATES THAN 
THE LABOUR PARTY 
HOW DOES THE TRACTION WORK WHAT DO 
THEY PICK UP WHEN THEY LOOK AT 
DAVID CAMERON THEY LOOK AT GEORGE 
OSBOURNE AND BORIS JOHNSON AND THEY 
SAY THESE GUYS DON'T REALLY 
REPRESENT US DO THEY THEY ARE 
BOYS IN THE WHITE TIE YOU MUST 
WINCE WHEN YOU SEE THAT PICTURE 
AGAINMENT 
I AM PURE WORKING CLASS AGAINMENT I HAVE THE PEDIGREE THAT MOST 
LABOUR LABOUR WOULD DIE TO HAVE 
THE REASON WE ARE COMING BACK IN 
THE NORTH WE HAVE GOT PEOPLE 
PREPARED TO JOIN NOW WE HAVE REAL 
TRACTION OUR MEMBERSHIP IS YOUNG 
UP THERE 
COME ON ERIC WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN 
YOU SEE THE THREE TOGETHER YOUR 
SINK ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR NOT ON A DOOR 
HAS ANYBODY RAISED THAT IT IS BY 
LABOUR OBSESSIVES AND JOURNALIST 
FROM A PRIVILEGED BACKGROUND WHO 
ARE OBSESSED BY IT 
WHAT ABOUT BORIS IF YOU DON'T WIN 
THE MAYORAL ELECTION HOW DAMAGING 
WOULD THAT BE 
I AM NOT 
CONTEMPLATING NOT WINNING THE 
MAYORAL ELECTION YOU HAVE SEEN THE 
POLLS AND I HAVE SEEN THE POLLS 
AND IT IS VERY CLOSE AND IT WILL 
DEPEND ON US GETTING OUR VOTE OUT 
AND LABOUR GETTING THEIR VOTE VOTE 
OUT OUT YOU MUST BE CONTEMPLATING BORIS 
JOHNSON BECOMING THE MOST SENIOR 
TORY IN THE COUNTRY 
I LOOK FORWARD 
TO HIM HAVING THE NUMBER ONE JOB IN 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IT WILL BE 
GOOD FOR LONDON BECAUSE WE WILL 
HAVE A MAYOR THAT WILL LOOK TOWARDS 
RUNNING THE WHOLE OF LONDON LONDON 
RATHER THAN PICKING FIGHTS WITH 
PEOPLE WITHIN LONDON

FRONT PAGES 
LET'S TAKE YOU BRIEFLY THROUGH THE FRONT PAGES 
FRONT PAGES THE TELEGRAPH HAS ENGLISH NOT THE 
FIRST LANGUAGE FOR EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND 
PEOPLEMENT ANOTHER TAKE ON THE IM

MORE ON THE WEBSITE 
FROM ALL OF US ON THE THE PROGRAMME 
A VERY GOOD NIGHT BYE BYE 
GOOD EVENING TUESDAY HAS ENDED ON 
A WET NOTE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
PARTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES AND IT 
LOOKS AS THOUGH AS WE THROW 
OURSELVES INTO WEDNESDAY SOME OF 
THAT RAIN IS GOING TO WORK ITS WAY 
FURTHER NORTH 
SO MAKE THE MOST OF THE DRY WEATHER 
IN THE NORTH WEST OF SCOTLAND AND 
THE RAIN WILL ALWAYS BE CLOSE BY TO 
THE EASTERN SIDE OF NORTHERN 
IRELAND FOLLOWING ON BEHIND THE 
PERSISTENT RAIN IT WILL BE SHOWERS 
RATHER THAN ANYTHING MORE 
PERSISTENT PERSISTENT ALTHOUGH IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SOME OF 
THE SHOWERS WILL BE HEAVY 
PROLONGED AND MIGHT CONTAIN THE ODD 
RUMBLE OF THUNDER 
YOU SEE HOW WIDESPREAD THEY BECOME 
AS YOU MOVE INTO THE SOUTH WEST 
THE TAIL END OF THE SAME FRONT THAT 
BROUGHT YOU RAIN ON TUESDAY IS 
STILL THERE ACROSS DEVON AND 
CORNWALL AND THE RAIN IS CLOSE BY 
TO THE WESTERN SIDE OF WALES TOO 
AND INTO NORTHERN IRELAND THE RAIN 
JUST AFFECTING THE FAR EAST OVER 
TOWARDS THE WEST SOMETHING DRIER 
AND BRIGHTER 
INTO THE SECOND PART OF THE WEEK 
LOW PRESSURE IS VERY MUCH THE 
DOMINANT THEME THINGS LOOKING 
UNSETTLED ACROSS THE NORTHERN PARTS 
OF THE BRITISH ISLES AND FURTHER 
SOUTH THE SHOWERS BECOMING LESS 
INTENSE AS WE MOVE INTO THURSDAY 
BUT THEY WILL BE FEATURE OF THE 
WEATHER RAIN HANGING ON IN THE 
WESTERN SIDE OF SCOTLAND THERE 
PEGGING THE TEMPERATURES BACK BUT 
FURTHER SOUTH WE MIGHT MAKE FOURTEEN
