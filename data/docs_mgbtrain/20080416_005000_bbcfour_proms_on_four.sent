HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
FOR B. B. C. FOUR'S LAST PROM OF THE SEASON 
WE'VE JUST ONE WORK TONIGHT MAHLER'S MONUMENTAL MUSICAL JOURNEY 
FROM DARKNESS INTO LIGHT 
HIS SYMPHONY NO SEVEN IN E. MINOR 
ON STAGE THE SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY 
AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR MUSIC DIRECTOR AND CONDUCTOR 
MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS JOINING ME KATHRYN KNIGHT THE PUBLISHING DIRECTOR OF FABER MUSIC 
KATHRYN A WARM WELCOME MAHLER'S SEVENTH SYMPHONY HAS AN INTERESTING STORY BEHIND ITS GENESIS HASN'T IT 
IT DOES IT WAS ACTUALLY WRITTEN ON THE BACK OF HIS COMPLETION 
OF THE SIXTH SYMPHONY SO HE STARTED WRITING IT IN NINETEEN OH FOUR 
WITH TWO OF THE CENTRAL MOVEMENTS 
THE TWO NACHTMUSIK OR NIGHT MUSIC 
SO THINGS WERE STARTING OUT VERY VERY WELL 
WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE SYMPHONY THE FOLLOWING YEAR HOWEVER 
HE FOUND THAT HE HAD THESE TWO MOVEMENTS 
AND HE WASN'T QUITE SURE HOW TO TAKE IT FORWARD 
THE STORY IS THAT THE FIRST MOVEMENT 
AND REALLY THE SORT OF MOTIF THAT RUNS THROUGH THE WHOLE OF THE WORK 
CAME TO HIM WHILST HE WAS AWAITING A BOAT TO TAKE HIM ACROSS AN ALPINE LAKE 
AND HE HEARD THIS RHYTHM B. A. D. A. D. A. DAH 
WHICH WAS THE OPENING THE INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST MOVEMENT 
AND REALLY THAT RHYTHMIC ELEMENT STRUCTURES THE WHOLE OF THE WORK 
YOU'RE CLEAR RIGHT FROM THE START I MEAN IT'S A LOVELY STORY THAT THERE HE WAS AWAITING A BOAT 
TO ROW HIM ACROSS THE LAKE AND THIS MOTIF THIS COLOUR 
THIS SOUND WORLD JUST CAME TO HIM HE SET GREAT STORE BY THOSE EXPERIENCES DIDN'T HE VERY MUCH 
AND CERTAINLY NATURE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO HIM THESE INFLUENCES 
SO THROUGHOUT YOU HEAR THESE WONDERFUL SOUNDS 
THE NIGHT MUSIC IS A VERY EVOCATIVE SOUND WORLD 
THE SYMPHONY IS UNCONVENTIONAL BECAUSE IT'S GOT FIVE MOVEMENTS RATHER THAN THE USUAL FOUR 
AND YOU'VE GOT A NACHTMUSIK AS THE SECOND AND THE FOURTH MOVEMENT AND THEY'RE IMMENSELY EVOCATIVE 
IMMENSELY EVOCATIVE INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT AS WELL 
THE SECOND MOVEMENT IS A SORT OF WHISTLING WHIRRING SOUNDS OF THE NIGHT 
THE SOUND OF RUSTLING OF FOUNTAINS AND THE NIGHT WIND 
WONDERFULLY EVOCATIVE FANTASTICALLY ORCHESTRATED 
AND OF COURSE HE WAS AN AMAZING ORCHESTRATOR WITH LOVELY COLOURS 
THE FOURTH MOVEMENT HOWEVER IS A VERY DIFFERENT SORT OF NIGHT MUSIC 
IT'S A SERENADE WONDERFUL SOUNDS 
AND OF COURSE THIS IS WHERE HE USES UNUSUALLY USES A MANDOLIN AND A GUITAR 
THESE TWO HAVING TO SIT THERE UNTIL THE FOURTH MOVEMENT BEFORE THEY EVEN START PLAYING 
A VERY SIMPLE FOLK LIKE SONG 
THERE'S ONE CLASSIC PASTORAL MOMENT WHERE HE USES A BUNCH OF COW BELLS 
PLAYING VERY DISTANTLY AND TONIGHT THEY'RE IN ONE OF THE BALCONIES OF THE ALBERT HALL 
SUGGESTING WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S SAID THAT THE COW BELLS ARE MEANT TO REPRESENT A LONELINESS 
BUT IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME HE'D USED COW BELLS 
HE'D USED THEM IN HIS SIXTH SYMPHONY AS WELL AND WAGNER DID BEFORE HIM ABSOLUTELY 
THE SIXTH SYMPHONY NOT ONLY HAD A COW BELL BUT ALSO A HAMMER 
AND THE FIFTH SYMPHONY HAS A WHIP AS WELL 
SO HE WAS RATHER PRONE TO USING SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE ORCHESTRA 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CENTRAL SCHERZO MOVEMENT 
IT'S A WONDERFUL RUMBUSTIOUS DANCE IN MANY WAYS 
AND YET ALWAYS WITH THAT KIND OF MAHLERIAN RESTRAINT IT NEVER GETS CAUSTIC NO 
AND THE CENTRAL MOVEMENT IS PHENOMENAL THIS WONDERFUL MACABRE WALTZ 
AGAIN INCREDIBLY MASTERFUL 
BUT VERY VERY EVOCATIVE 
THE THREE CENTRAL MOVEMENTS ARE VERY POWERFUL AS A SET OF THREE 
AND OF COURSE THERE'S THE FINALE IT'S A RONDO FINALE 
A THEME THAT COMES ROUND AND ROUND SEVERAL TIMES 
THAT MOVEMENT IS THE REASON WHY THIS SYMPHONY IS VIEWED AS THE MOST PROBLEMATIC OF MAHLER'S WORKS 
IT'S TRUE TO SAY YEAH I THINK THAT'S RIGHT NOT BY EVERYBODY 
INDEED SCHOENBERG IT WAS FOR HIM IT WAS THE LAST MOVEMENT 
THAT INSPIRED HIM PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER WORKS THAT MAHLER WROTE 
IT WAS LIKE HIS GATEWAY INTO MAHLER'S MUSIC THAT'S RIGHT 
IT WAS REALLY QUITE DIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING ELSE HE WROTE 
TONALITY WISE HE WAS CHALLENGING I THINK HIS AUDIENCE IN MANY MANY WAYS 
THEY WERE HEARING THINGS THEY'D NEVER HEARD BEFORE 
THAT'S A PERTINENT POINT PEOPLE THINK OF HIM AS ONE OF THE LAST GREAT ROMANTICS IF NOT THE LAST 
BUT SO MUCH OF HIS MUSIC IS NOT BACKWARD LOOKING AT ALL IT'S VERY COSMOPOLITAN AND SPICY ABSOLUTELY 
AND THE INSTRUMENTATION INCREDIBLE UNUSUAL TEXTURES WE HAVE COUNTER MELODIES ON TOP OF EACH OTHER 
AND OF COURSE THE OTHER THING THAT ONE FORGETS ABOUT MAHLER 
WITH THIS FIVE MOVEMENT WORK 
AND WITH THE DIFFICULTIES THE AUDIENCE HAD 
IT'S JUST THE SHEER SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE THING ABSOLUTELY VAST 
I MEAN EIGHTEEN MINUTES OF FANTASTIC SYMPHONIC WRITING 
AND UM HE WROTE TEN SYMPHONIES IN EFFECT HOW ON EARTH HE HAD 
HE HAD A WEALTH OF IDEAS AND OF COURSE FAMOUSLY FOR HIM 
THE SYMPHONY WAS EVERYTHING IT SHOULD ENCAPSULATE THE WORLD 
AND YOU DO HEAR IT IN THIS SOME WONDERFUL PASTORAL SOUNDS DANCES 
EVERYTHING THESE FANFARES 
HE'S QUITE A MAGPIE LIKE COMPOSER LIKE ALL THE GREAT COMPOSERS 
THAT HIS MUSIC OFTEN IF NOT DIRECTLY QUOTES FROM REFERS TO LITTLE TOUCHES OF BEETHOVEN 
EVEN ELEMENTS OF BIZET'S CARMEN IN A COUPLE OF PLACES ABSOLUTELY AND THE DANCE LIKE MOTIFS HE USES 
BUT ALSO UM YOU HAVE IN THE LAST MOVEMENT 
VERY MUCH THAT IS REMINISCENT OF WAGNER AS WELL 
BUT ALSO THE MOTIF LIKE IDEAS HE USES FOLLOWING THE GREAT MASTERS OF THAT FORM 
LIKE BERLIOZ WITH THAT FATE MOTIF HE ALSO USES IN THE SIXTH SYMPHONY 
THE FLATTENING OF THE CHORD VERY VERY WONDERFUL WRITING 
KATHRYN KNIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
APPLAUSE NOW FOR MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS COMING ON STAGE 
TO CONDUCT HIS OWN SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY IN MAHLER'S SEVENTH SYMPHONY 
AN ALMOST RECKLESS MIX OF EVERY MUSIC MAHLER COULD IMAGINE 
FROM SOPHISTICATION TO UTTER NAIVETY 
OF COURSE AS HE SAID HIMSELF A SYMPHONY HAD TO BE LIKE THE WORLD 
IT MUST EMBRACE EVERYTHING 
MAHLER'S SEVENTH SYMPHONY 
PERFORMED BY THE SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY 
LED BY ALEXANDER BARANTSCHIK 
AND CONDUCTED BY MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS 
AN ORCHESTRA AND CONDUCTOR I'M SURE YOU'D AGREE 
WHO ABSOLUTELY HAVE THIS MUSIC IN THEIR BLOODSTREAM 
APPLAUSE THERE FOR THE PRINCIPAL HORN OF THE SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY ROBERT WARD 
AND THERE'S THE WHOLE HORN SECTION ON THEIR FEET

IS ALSO THE PRINCIPAL TROMBONE OF THE ORCHESTRA MARK H. LAWRENCE 
THERE'S THE WHOLE WOODWIND CHORUS ON THEIR FEET 
YEAH BIG APPLAUSE THERE FOR THE TIMPANIST DAVID HERBERT 
IT'S INCREDIBLE TO THINK NOW HOW LONG MAHLER'S MUSIC 
TOOK TO BECOME TRULY ACCEPTED ACROSS THE WORLD 
HE WAS MUCH MORE CELEBRATED AS A CONDUCTOR THAN AS A COMPOSER 
IN HIS LIFETIME HIS MUSIC BEING DISMISSED BY MANY AT THE TIME 
AS TOO EXTREME TOO PACKED FULL OF EXTREME EXPRESSION 
FRANZ SCHMIDT AT THE TIME DESCRIBED HIS SYMPHONIES AS CHEAP NOVELS 
BUT AS MAHLER PROPHETICALLY SAID MY TIME WILL COME 
SO FROM ALL OF US HERE AT THE ALBERT HALL 
A VERY GOOD NIGHT
