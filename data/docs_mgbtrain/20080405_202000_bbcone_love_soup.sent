I COULDN'T WALK FOR WEEKS YOU'RE SUCH A SLAG 
I KNOW I'M GONNA CHECK THE PASTA 
ALLY'S HERE I'LL GET IT 
SORRY IT'S BEEN ONE OF THOSE DAYS 
HONESTLY I MAY HAVE TO KILL MYSELF 
AND HOW WAS THE FLAT TERRIBLE ABSOLUTE DUMP 
OH GOD I'M NEVER GONNA FIND ANYWHERE IN LONDON AT THIS RATE NOT ANYWHERE I CAN AFFORD 
I SHALL END UP RENTING OUT MY PLACE IN BRIGHTON TO SAVE ON TRAIN FARES AND LIVING IN A SEPTIC TANK

IS YOU COME OVER ALL THE WHILE AS SO NEGATIVE 
OH GOD ONE SUPPOSE I DO 
O. K. SO WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE NOT SURE HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS BLOKE GARY 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
OH I DON'T KNOW IT'S THAT SAME OLD THING 
THE MORE YOU GET TO KNOW SOMEONE AND EVERYTHING THAT MAKES THEM TICK 
IF YOUR SENSE OF HUMOUR'S OUT OF KILTER YOU'RE IN TROUBLE 
WHAT WITH THAT AND HIS UNNATURAL FETISH FOR CARS 
NOT SINCE WE STUDIED THE MOTIVATION OF EMMA WOODHOUSE AT SCHOOL 
HAVE I HAD LESS INTEREST IN WHAT GOES ON UNDER A BONNET 
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE REACTION I GOT WHICH PROVES MY POINT 
YOU SAY ALL OF THAT BUT YOU DO HAVE A TENDENCY MISS CHENERY 
TO BE ON THE FUSSY SIDE IF I MAY BE SO BOLD 
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET ANYWHERE WITH ANYONE 
IF YOU DON'T GIVE IT TIME AND WORK AT IT A PROPOS OF WHICH 
OH GOD WHAT'S THIS 
WELL THE OTHER DAY WE DREW UP A LIST OF NAMES OF GUYS IN THE STORE WHO MIGHT HAVE SOME POTENTIAL 
I CROSS CHECKED WITH MARCIA IN THE PHARMACY TO SEE WHO'D CASHED IN A PRESCRIPTION FOR WHAT 
IN THE LAST YEAR TO MAKE SURE THEY'VE GOT A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH 
I BEG YOUR PARDON YOU GOT ONE OF THE CHEMIST'S ASSISTANTS TO LOOK UP THEIR CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS 
THERE'S MIKE WHO WORKS IN THE SHOE DEPARTMENT WHO I KNOW IS SINGLE 
NOW HE HAS BEEN ON STREPTOMYCIN TETRACYCLINE AND ONLY LAST TUESDAY A COURSE OF AMPICILLIN 
THAT'S THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANTIBIOTICS SO 
SOMETHING'S TAKING A LONG WHILE TO CLEAR UP THERE 
WHAT ABOUT THAT GUY IN CHINAWARE NEVILLE CAULDWELL 
HE LOOKS YOUR TYPE AND SMILES WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH 
AND SINCE MARCH HAS BEEN ON A REPEAT ORDER FOR PROZAC LIKE YOU 
RIGHT TWO LATENT DEPRESSIVES I SUPPOSE THAT COULD WORK 
IT DEPENDS WHETHER WHAT AM I DOING LISTENING TO THE PAIR OF YOU 
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN EVERYONE'S PRIVATE MEDICAL HISTORY 
OR WHICH MALE EMPLOYEE IN THE STORE HAPPENS TO SUFFER FROM ANAL ITCHING 
AH NOW THERE YOU'D BE SURPRISED REALLY WHO 
I TELL YOU WHO I COULD GO A BUNDLE ON IS THAT GREEK BLOKE ILEUS 
WHO'S DOING THE COOKING DEMOS IN THE LOBBY 
MM A BIT ON THE SWARTHY SIDE

AND LISTEN THAT'S SOMETHING MARCIA TOLD ME YESTERDAY I FORGOT TO SAY 
WHEN ANTONIA SAID SHE'D GONE TO GET SOMETHING FOR HER HEADACHE 
AND WAS OFF THE COUNTER FOR HALF AN HOUR 
I HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT SHE NEVER WENT ANYWHERE NEAR THE PHARMACY DEPARTMENT 
COURSE NOT COS SHE WENT OUTSIDE FOR A FAG AS WE ALL KNOW PERFECTLY WELL 
I'VE TOLD A FEW FIBS BUT SHE IS OUTRAGEOUS 
SOME OF THE TALES SHE COMES OUT WITH I KNOW 
SHE'S BEEN A REAL PROBLEM THAT ONE EVER SINCE SHE STARTED BUT 
LEAVE IT WITH ME 
THANKS THAT'S GREAT COME BACK ANY TIME WE HAVE SO MUCH FOOD

I'M REALLY SORRY ONLY I WAS COMING OFF THE TUBE AND THERE 
WAS THIS OLD FELLA FELL HEAD FIRST DOWN THE ESCALATOR 
AND HIS FOREHEAD WAS ALL GASHED OPEN HE WAS BLEEDING EVERYWHERE 
SO I HAD TO STAY THERE AND HELP 
OH RIGHT FINE 
WELL YOU HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB THERE THEN 
I MEAN IT WAS SO TRAGIC 
MANAGING ALL THAT WITHOUT GETTING A SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD ON YOUR DRESS 
WELL YEAH BUT 
THAT'S THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH 
I'D HARDLY MAKE A THING LIKE THAT UP 
RIGHT COS IT'S LIKE LAST NIGHT 
WHEN I LET YOU LEAVE EARLY BECAUSE YOUR SISTER HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO TWINS 
AND I DID APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN WHEN I ASKED YOU THIS MORNING 
HOW CHARLOTTE AND JESSICA WERE YOU COULDN'T QUITE PLACE THE NAMES 
OH T. C. H. 
I KNOW COS I'D HAD SUCH A SLEEPLESS NIGHT WITH THESE PEOPLE I'VE GOT LIVING NEXT DOOR TO ME NOW 
DID I NOT TELL YOU ABOUT THAT 
THIS FAMILY OF ASYLUM SEEKERS FROM ALBANIA 
LOOK ANTONIA 
I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO A LECTURE ON THE MORAL ISSUE BUT YOU MIGHT JUST WANT TO 
CONSIDER THE WISDOM OF TROTTING OUT BARE FACED LIES TO YOUR COLLEAGUES 
BECAUSE IT'LL GET TO THE POINT WHERE NO ONE WILL TRUST YOU 
OR TAKE A SINGLE THING YOU SAY SERIOUSLY DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING 
NOW FOR GOODNESS SAKE PLEASE TRY AND BUCK YOUR IDEAS UP 
AND GO AND SORT THIS ONE OUT WHILE I POP ROUND THE CORNER FOR A SANDWICH 
O. K. PUT IN BRAD PITT I'M SURE THEY DID A COMMERCIAL TOGETHER 
O. K. HOW WE DOING OVER HERE THEN NO REALLY 
ALL RIGHT THEN TRY GOOGLING ANGELINA JOLIE LIKES AND DISLIKES ALL DAY BODY LOTION 
HOW YOU DOING NOW ALLY STILL A BIT FRAGILE O. K. EVERYONE 
HERE'S THE COMPLETE LOWDOWN AS FAR AS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER FROM ALL MY SOURCES 
HER NAME WAS GERALDINE PROSSER 
AGED FIFTY THREE AND SHE WORKED IN GARDEN FURNISHINGS 
NEVER MARRIED UNATTACHED NEVER HAD A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP AND LIVED ALONE WITH HER PET LABRADOR 
AND APPARENTLY HAD BEEN SUFFERING WITH SERIOUS EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
AS PER SUCCESSIVE COURSES OF PRAMINIL TRYPTOPHAN AND PYRIDOXINE 
SHE'D BEEN OUT TO THAT SANDWICH BAR NEXT DOOR FOR AN EGG ROLL 
AND WHEN SHE GOT BACK SHE FOUND IT WAS ALL DRIED UP AND HARD INSIDE 
AND THAT TIPPED HER OVER THE EDGE LITERALLY 
TELL ME ABOUT IT I HAD A PRAWN BAGUETTE THERE LAST WEEK 
AND THE BREAD I'M NOT KIDDING WAS AS HARD AS ROCK IT WAS SO DOCTOR 
OH NO HANG ON GERALDINE PROSSER 
WAS SHE THAT ONE WITH THE GLASSES AND A FACE LIKE A WET WEEK 
OH GOD AND I TOLD HER TO SOD OFF 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN 
LAST WEEK WHEN I WAS UP THERE 
I'D JUST PUT MY BAG DOWN ON ONE OF HER PINE TABLES TO GET OUT A TISSUE 
AND SHE SAID WOULD I KINDLY REMOVE IT COS IT MIGHT SCRATCH THE WOOD 
I WAS JUST IN A REALLY FOUL MOOD THAT DAY WITH MY HAY FEVER AND EVERYTHING AND 
YOU DON'T THINK THAT AFFECTED ANYTHING IT WASN'T A VERY NICE THING TO SAY 
OH DON'T NOW I FEEL TERRIBLE 
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS ABOUT TO TOP HERSELF DID I 
OOH AND I'LL TELL YOU ANOTHER THING THAT MAY OR NOT BE OF INTEREST 
BUT YOU KNOW THEY RECKON THERE'S BEEN A BIG INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF PILFERING ON CERTAIN COUNTERS 
THE WORD IN SECURITY IS MANAGEMENT HAVE HAD ENOUGH 
AND THEY'RE BRINGING IN THIS PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON IF SHE WAS THE THIEF AND SHE'D JUST FOUND OUT THIS GUY WAS ON TO HER 
I DUNNO ABOUT THAT 
FROM WHAT THEY'RE SAYING JUST SOUNDS LIKE SHE WAS REALLY LONELY POOR SOD 
AND YOU SEE ALLY THAT'S LIKE I KEEP SAYING TO YOU 
YOU JUST SIT AROUND WAITING FOR THIS NONEXISTENT MR. PERFECT 
NEXT THING WE'RE ALL OUT THERE SCRAPING YOU OFF THE TARMAC WITH A PENKNIFE 
REMIND ME NOT TO ASK FOR YOU NEXT TIME I RING THE SAMARITANS 
YOU DON'T HALF TELL IT LIKE IT IS WELL YOU KNOW I'M JUST SAYING I KNOW 
IF I DON'T LOWER MY SIGHTS AND GET HITCHED UP THEY SHOULD WIRE ME UP TO THE NATIONAL GRID 
THANK YOU I SHALL GIVE THOSE WORDS CAREFUL CONSIDERATION TOMORROW ON MY DAY OFF 
IN THE MEANTIME DO YOU MIND IF WE JUST DROP THE SUBJECT NOW PLEASE 
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY 
I CAN'T BELIEVE I TOLD HER TO SOD OFF 
HELLO

YES I AM ABSOLUTELY SURE 
WELL HAVE YOU TRIED LOOKING RIGHT AT THE BACK BEHIND THE BODY CREAMS 
NO PROBLEM MILLY YES YOU TOO BYE 
HELLO 
ERM 
WELL JUST ASK YOURSELF ANTONIA IS IT LIKELY THAT ANY PRODUCT WOULD BE PRICED AT SIXTY SIX POINT EIGHT ONE 
I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT A MISSING POUND SIGN PROBABLY 
AND IF YOU TURN THE BOX THE OTHER WAY UP YOU'LL BE A LOT NEARER THE MARK 
IT'S GOT SOMETHING CALLED POTASSIUM SORBATE AS WELL APPARENTLY 
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THE OTHER WEBSITE ON DANGEROUS ADDITIVES SEE WHAT IT SAYS 
HIYA WHAT GOODIES HAVE YOU GOT FOR US TODAY TODAY I HAVE KALAMATA OLIVES 
OH 
HAS IT GOT A SKULL BY IT OR A TOILET SEAT 
HELLO 
NO THERE'S AN AFTERSHAVE AND AN AFTERSHAVE BALM 
BUT THE PRE ELECTRIC OIL ONLY COMES IN A SPECIAL PROMOTIONAL GIFT SET 
I DID GO THROUGH ALL THIS WITH YOU LAST WEEK CLEO 
I KNOW SORRY TO HAVE DISTURBED YOU 
HAVE A GOOD DAY OFF AND TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT WORK 
YES I'M CERTAINLY TRYING 
YEAH BYE 
VERY TASTY AND FRESH THIS MORNING 
BET HE WAS 
WHAT'S THIS THEN WHO'S OSCAR 
IT WAS ON THIS CARD ON THE STAFF NOTICE BOARD 
I JUST SCRIBBLED IT DOWN 
ASKING IF ANYONE CAN FIND A GOOD HOME FOR HER DOG 
THAT WOMAN MISS PROSSER WHO 
WHAT YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY THINKING OF 
NO AFTER WHAT I SAID TO HER THAT DAY I JUST FEEL I DON'T KNOW OBLIGATED SOMEHOW 
I'LL GIVE ALLY A RING SEE WHAT SHE THINKS 
SORRY IS THIS SEAT TAKEN 
OH NO PLEASE GO AHEAD I WAS JUST OFF ACTUALLY 
OH DEAR REALLY 
NOT MY DAY IS IT 
THIS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE FOR ANYONE WHO'S NOT HEARD IT YET 
DO YOU WANT TO TELL THEM OR SHALL I 
I DECIDED IN THE END 
ALL RIGHT THEN I'LL TELL THEM 
SHE MADE THE DECISION TO TAKE ON THIS DOG THIS POOR WOMAN LEFT BEHIND WHO JUMPED OUT THE WINDOW 
WHOSE NAME FOR YOUR RECORDS IS OSCAR 
ONLY OSCAR WHEN SHE MEETS HIM DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO KNOW 
SHE HAS GREAT TROUBLE BONDING WITH HIM 
SO I SUGGESTED FIND OUT WHAT PERFUME SHE USED TO WEAR 
COS THEY'RE VERY BIG ON SCENT OBVIOUSLY ANIMALS 
FAST FORWARD TO YESTERDAY AFTERNOON 
SHE'S DOUSING HERSELF WITH RIVE GAUCHE NO PROBLEM 
NOW OSCAR'S HER BIGGEST FRIEND HE'S ALL OVER HER 
GETS HIM HOME LAST NIGHT AND 
OH GO ON YOU BETTER FINISH IT COS IT JUST CRACKS ME UP EVERY TIME 
WELL I'D LEFT HIM IN THE KITCHEN 
HAVING SOME BISCUITS AS I THOUGHT WHILE I WENT TO HAVE A SHOWER 
ONLY JUST BEFORE I GOT IN I'D DROPPED THIS CONTACT LENS ON THE FLOOR IN THE BEDROOM 
WOULD YOU SAY HE WAS BONDING A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN YOU'D HAVE LIKED AT THAT POINT 
YES ALL RIGHT WHEN YOU'VE ALL FINISHED GIGGLING AND GUFFAWING 
I SUPPOSE I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE AM I WHO FINDS THIS ALL DEEPLY SAD AND TRAGIC 
I THINK YOU PROBABLY ARE ACTUALLY MILL I'M SO SORRY 
I MEAN THAT THIS WAS VERY POSSIBLY THE ONLY PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP 
THIS POOR WOMAN EVER HAD IN HER WHOLE LIFE 
THAT SHE WAS SO LONELY AND DESPERATE FOR A BIT OF LOVE AND ATTENTION 
THERE'S A BIT OF LOVE AND ATTENTION AND THERE'S BEING ROGERED BY A DOG 
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THERE'S A SUBTLE DISTINCTION 
WE'RE JUMPING TO SOME WILD CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HER PRIVATE LIFE 
BASED ON ONE BRIEF FRISKY MOMENT 
GOD THE MINDS YOU PEOPLE HAVE GOT 
EXCEPT I NOTICE THERE'S BEEN NO FURTHER ATTENTION SINCE I WASHED ALL THAT RIVE GAUCHE OFF EXPLAIN THAT 
THERE'S STILL TIME FOR YOU TO AVOID THAT SAME FATE 
IF YOU START GETTING YOUR ACT TOGETHER 
WHEN ARE YOU SEEING THIS TOM YOU MET IN THE CAFE 
OH WELL NOTHING'S BEEN ARRANGED AS I SAID 
I MEAN I GAVE HIM MY NUMBER BUT 
CHANCES ARE I'LL NEVER HEAR FROM HIM AGAIN 
HE DID SEEM QUITE INTERESTED IN ME I'LL GRANT YOU ONCE WE GOT CHATTING BUT HOW DO YOU EVER KNOW 
HE WAS PROBABLY JUST ON STRONG MEDICATION 
ANYWAY WHAT TIME IS IT 
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD REALLY BE SHOOTING OFF IN A MIN OH HELLO 
ALLY DO YOU KNOW ILEUS AND CRAIG WHAT YOU DRINKING GUYS I'M IN THE CHAIR 
THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE 
UNFORTUNATELY 
ANTONIA IS IT 
I WONDER IF I COULD ASK TO SEE THE CONTENTS OF YOUR PURSE 
WHAT FOR 
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A REPORT THAT JUST AFTER CLOSING TIME TONIGHT 
WHEN YOU WERE ON YOUR OWN AT THE COUNTER YOU OPENED THE TILL AND POCKETED A FIFTY NOTE 
OH THIS IS A WIND UP 
YOU LOOKED AROUND TO BE SURE THERE WAS NO ONE WATCHING 
BUT I COULD SEE VERY CLEARLY FROM BEHIND THE PILLAR NEAR THE DOOR 
YOU ARE JOKING WHEN DID YOU 
LOOK I DON'T KNOW WHEN HE PUT THAT IN THERE OR HOW BUT 
I'D NEVER TAKE MONEY FROM THAT TILL 
D'YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT 
COS HE TRIED TO MAKE A MOVE ON ME DIDN'T HE 
LAST NIGHT IN THE CAR PARK AND I WASN'T HAVING ANY OF IT 
SO NOW THIS IS HOW HE'S GETTING HIS OWN BACK 
NOW SHE IS BEING RIDICULOUS 
HE HAD ME PINNED TO THE CAR 
I MEAN FOR GOD'S SAKE YOU DO BELIEVE ME 
I THINK IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN 
YOU TOLD ME THIS CLEO HER WORD CAN NEVER BE TRUSTED 
RIGHT 
WELL THANK YOU GUYS 
TIME LIKE THIS YOU REALLY FIND OUT WHO YOUR FRIENDS ARE 
HELLO HELLO I TRIED 
HELLO 
OH HI 
NO NO I MEAN WHAT'S TOO LATE 
NO I WAS JUST OH REALLY 
ME TOO WE'VE HAD SOME RIGHT RUCTIONS TODAY 
WITH THAT NEW GIRL I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT 
THAT'S ALL BLOWN UP NOW INTO A REAL CRY WOLF SITUATION AND 
HAS IT 
I'LL BET 
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR LINE OF WORK THEN TOM I DON'T THINK YOU EVER GOT ROUND TO MENTIONING 
NO 
NO NO I'M STILL HERE YES 
JUST ABOUT 
ARE YOU MAKING THAT UP I AM NOT MAKING IT UP THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME LAST NIGHT 
WHAT HE ACTUALLY DOES FOR A LIVING 
I MEAN 
JUST WHEN IT ALL SEEMED TO BE INCH PERFECT AND I WAS DARING TO GET MY HOPES UP 
ALL RIGHT WELL LOOK THE THING IS NOT TO PANIC 
COS WHAT HAVE WE BEEN SAYING ALL WEEK THAT SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TRY AND GO FOR THE POSITIVES 
EVEN WHEN THINGS DO LOOK A BIT DODGY 
YES THAT'S GOOD ADVICE COMING FROM YOU 
I NOTICE RELATIONS WITH MR. KEBABS HAVE GONE DISTINCTLY COOL AFTER LAST NIGHT 
THAT'S DIFFERENT YOU HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE AT SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
THE AWFUL THING IS SHE GETS THE HEAVE HO WHILE HE JUST GETS AWAY WITH IT 
BECAUSE SHE'D ALREADY COOKED HER GOOSE HADN'T SHE BEFOREHAND 
EXACTLY AS I PREDICTED 
SO YOU TWO BE WARNED 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MONKEY AROUND WITH THE TRUTH 
OR THEN AGAIN COS I HATE TO SEE INNOCENT PEOPLE MALIGNED AS MUCH AS YOU DO 
WELL BUGGER ME 
SO I THINK JUSTICE WAS ACTUALLY DONE IN THE END WOULD YOU SAY 
OH GOD 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING NOW 
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE BOTH THINKING 
ILEUS 
THE UNDERCOVER DETECTIVE 
SHIT 
IF THERE'S ONE THING I'VE LEARNT IN LIFE IT'S GO WITH YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
PEOPLE GIVE OFF I THINK A KIND OF AURA THAT YOU EITHER RESPOND TO OR YOU DON'T 
I KNOW EXCEPT HER AURA STRANGELY ENOUGH WAS VERY GOOD 
ONCE YOU GOT PAST ALL THE TALL STORIES 
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WITH A BIT OF TIME AND PATIENCE I COULD HAVE TURNED HER AROUND BUT 
JUST SHOWS I SUPPOSE I'M NO JUDGE OF CHARACTER 
NOT TO SAY WE DON'T HAVE TO BE ECONOMICAL WITH THE FACTS SOMETIMES FOR SHEER SELF PRESERVATION 
I DO SAIL A BIT CLOSE TO THE WIND 
YE E. S. THAT WAS A BIT OF A JOLT WHEN YOU SAID THAT 
AND SO THIS IS ONE OF YOUR 
TOP OF THE RANGE MAGICIAN'S STAGE PLATFORMS 
COMPLETE WITH ANGLED MIRRORS IN THE BASE AND FULLY FUNCTIONING TRAPDOOR 
CONSTRUCTED AND CHECKED ON SITE 
THEN BOXED AND SHIPPED IN KIT FORM FOR EASY ASSEMBLY TO EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE 
FROM AFRICA TO CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE FAR EAST 
AS YOU SEE WE HAVE A TIGHT LITTLE WORKFORCE HERE OF THREE 
AMAZING THAT IS A GREAT SALES PITCH TOM 
I COULD ALMOST IMAGINE YOU BELIEVE IT 
WELL THE ART OF THE ILLUSIONIST ISN'T IT MISDIRECTION 
OBVIOUSLY IF A CUSTOMER CHOOSES TO IGNORE MY ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS 
AND SOMEHOW FINDS AN ALTERNATIVE USE FOR THE PRODUCT 
THE BLAME CAN'T BE LAID AT YOUR DOOR 
O. K. LISTEN 
I ALMOST DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU BUT THAT WOULD HARDLY HAVE GOT US OFF TO A GOOD START WOULD IT 
KEEPING SECRETS FROM EACH OTHER 
YOU GO WHERE THE MARKETS ARE ALICE 
HOW DO I TELL OTHER SOCIETIES HOW TO RUN THEIR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS 
IF YOU DICTATE TO A DICTATOR DOES THAT MAKE YOU ONE AS WELL 
IT'S A REAL MORAL MAZE 
MEANWHILE 
THIS IS HOW YOU GET ROUND THE EXPORT REGULATIONS 
MOST INGENIOUSLY IT HAS TO BE SAID 
NOW IF YOU LOOK ON AMAZON UNDER AVERAGE CUSTOMER REVIEW HOW MANY STARS DO THEY GIVE IT 
O. K. THEN GO TO ROTTEN TOMATOES DOT COM AND JUST READ ME A SELECTION OF THE REVIEWS JUST SO I GET AN IDEA 
COS I'M NOT GONNA WATCH IT IF IT'S CRAP AM I 
AND SO IT WAS THE OLD OLD ETHICAL DILEMMA I'M AFRAID 
DID I WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH A MAN 
WHO SELLS FLAT PACK SCAFFOLDS TO THE KANGAROO COURTS OF THE WORLD 
YOU SEE THAT IS SUCH A SHAME 
I'D HAVE PUT MONEY ON YOU GETTING A QUICK ONE IN THERE AT LEAST 
HOW DO YOU KNOW I DIDN'T DID YOU 
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS 
ERM CLEO WHOOPS A DAISY I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT 
THIS WOULDN'T BY ANY CHANCE INDICATE A SLIGHT THAW IN ANGLO GREEK RELATIONS AT ALL 
THAT'S A BIT OF A SORE POINT WITH HER AFTER ALL THE FUN AND GAMES AT LUNCHTIME COS 
DO YOU WANT TO TELL HER OR SHALL I 
AFTER WHAT WE SAW ON THOSE PICTURES 
ALL RIGHT I'LL TELL HER 
SOON AS SHE'D WORKED OUT THIS GUY'S ONLY POSING AS A FOOD REP AS PART OF THIS SURVEILLANCE OPERATION 
SHE WAS STRAIGHT BACK IN THERE 
DRIBBLING MOUSSAKA EVERY TIME SHE CAME BACK 
BUT THEN SHE COMPLETELY OVERCOOKS IT 
STARTS RAZZING HIM ABOUT HIS CRAP ACCENT 
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A BIT HARRY ENFIELD AND AS FOR THAT MOUSTACHE 
WHICH SHE GRABS HOLD OF AND STARTS TRYING TO PULL OFF 
SHE'S GOT THE POINT I WONDER YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE SCREAMS 
AT WHICH POINT THESE THREE COPPERS APPEAR AND GO OVER 
TO THOSE TWO WOMEN IN THE FOOD HALL AND MARCH THEM OFF TO THE MANAGER'S OFFICE 
THEY WERE THE ONES WHO'D BEEN LIFTING ALL THAT EXPENSIVE GEAR FOR MONTHS 
AND NOW THEY'VE FINALLY BEEN RUMBLED 
YOU THINK THIS IS ALL DOWN TO YOUR FRIEND 
SADLY I'VE GOT THE DISTINCT FEELING WE'VE ALL BEEN BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE THERE 
DOES HE REALLY CUT IT AS THIS SUPER DUPER PRIVATE DETECTIVE 
WHO'S BEEN WORKING UNDERCOVER TO TRY AND INFILTRATE WHAT IS IT 
OH I HAVE GOT TO BE DREAMING THIS NOW 
SURELY 
ALICE HI 
LOOK GOD 
WELL 
CONGRATULATIONS THEN 
I SUPPOSE THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL A CORKSCREW ENDING 
UNFORTUNATELY THESE THINGS TAKE A LONG TIME TO SET UP 
AND A LOT OF VERY DEVIOUS GROUNDWORK 
BEFORE I COULD GAIN THEIR CONFIDENCE ENOUGH TO GET ALL THE EVIDENCE WE NEEDED 
FOR WHICH MANY APOLOGIES 
AND ESPECIALLY ALL THAT CAR PARK STUFF WHICH JUST SEEMED TO BE THE RIGHT THING TO THROW IN AT THE TIME 
I MEAN POOR OLD ILEUS BLESS HIM BUT 
ANYWAY MISSION COMPLETED AND I HOPE YOU'LL ALL BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THIS 
I REALLY ENJOYED WORKING WITH YOU 
THE TRUTH IS I'M JUST NOT A DOG PERSON 
AND WITH MY BROTHER AND HIS FAMILY HAVING JUST MOVED OUT TO THE COUNTRY 
THEY'LL ENJOY ALL THAT GOING FOR WALKS ON THE HILLS AND EVERYTHING 
SO ALL BEING WELL THEY'LL PICK HIM UP THIS WEEKEND 
BEFORE HE HAS A CHANCE TO GET TOO ATTACHED TO ME SO TO SPEAK 
SO WHAT D'YOU THINK MILL LET HIM HAVE A BIT OF A RUN AROUND NOW 
GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO STRETCH HIS LEGS WHY NOT 
OH GOD 
YEAH I BELIEVE IT IS THEY'VE GOT REALLY GOOD DEALS 
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU YOU'RE SO TETCHY LATELY 
OH WELL THAT'S NOT NICE IS IT 
IN A PUBLIC PLACE AT LUNCHTIME OSCAR YOU LITTLE TERROR 
BEHAVE YOURSELF 
YOU THINK WE SHOULD LEND A HAND 
HE SEEMS TO BE MANAGING ALL RIGHT ON HIS OWN 
WHEN SHE CAME IN THE STORE AGAIN THIS MORNING AND YOU WENT OUT SPRAYING ALL AND SUNDRY MM HMM 
I DIDN'T BY ANY CHANCE SEE A BOTTLE OF RIVE GAUCHE IN YOUR HAND AT ANY POINT 
DO YOU WANT THE HONEST ANSWER TO THAT 
YOUR USUAL RESPONSE WILL BE FINE 
ABSOLUTELY AND MOST DEFINITELY NOT 
FAIR ENOUGH THEN SHALL WE BE GETTING BACK 
GET OFF ME GET THIS MUTT OFF ME 
STOP IT HELP ME 
YOU GOT ME BEGGING YOU FOR MERCY
