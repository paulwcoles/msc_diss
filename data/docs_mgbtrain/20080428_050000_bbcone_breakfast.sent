WORLD WORLD FOR THE FIRST TIME BRITISH 
SCIENTISTS HAVE MANAGED TO REVERSE 
BLINDNESS USING GENE THERAPY TO 
REGENERATE LIGHT DETECTING CELLS 
BEHIND THE RETINA 
SIX MONTHS AGO STEPHEN COULD HARDLY 
SEE IN THE DARK NOW THANKS TO A 
PIONEERING OPERATION HIS SIGHT HAS 
BEGUN TO IMPROVE SCIENTISTS HERE 
ARE ASSESSING STEPHEN'S VISION BY 
MAKING HIM WALK THROUGH THIS DIMLY 
LIT MAIZE MAZE THIS IS WHAT HE

OPERATION HE KEEPS BUMPING INTO 
THE WALLS IT TAKES HIM ONE MINUTE 
SEVENTEEN SECONDS TO GET TO THE END SIX

GENES HAVE HEALED THE DYING CELLS

WHEN I 
GO TO SAINSBURY'S WITH MY MUM I 
CAN TAKE THE TROLTKWRI BACK FOR HER 
YOU'D LIKE TO HELP YOUR MUM MORE 
YEAH 
IT'S EARLY DAYS FOR THE YEAH RESEARCH BUT THE SCIENTISTS 
INVOLVED HOPE THAT GENE THERAPY 
COULD BE USED TO TREAT A WIDE RANGE 
OF SIGHT DISORDERS 
POLICE IN AUSTRIA ARE INVESTIGATING 
WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARY 
AND SHOCKING STORY OF ABUSE 
THEY'VE ARRESTED A SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD MAN 
WHO'S ACCUSED OF KEEPING ONE OF HIS 
DAUGHTERERS CAPTIVE IN A CELL CAR 
FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS AND HAVING SEVEN 
CHILDREN ARE HER 
BEHIND THIS DOOR LIES A SHOCKING 
STORY OF ALLEGE ADD BUES THE 
VICTIM TOLD POLICE SHE WAS HELD 
PRISONER IN A CELLER REPEATEDLY 
SEX LAY BUEZED SHE SAYS BY HER 
FATHER FOR YEARS HE'S NOW UNDER 
ARREST ACCUSED OF ABDUCTION AND 
FATHERING HER SEVEN CHILDREN IT'S 
UNDERSTOOD ONE BABY DIED POLICE 
SAY THREE OF THE CHILDREN LED 
RELATIVELY NORMAL LIVES LIVING 
UPSTAIRS WITH JOSEF AND HIS WIFE 
SHEUALS REPORTEDLY UNAWARE OF WHAT 
WAS HAPPENING THE OTHERS WERE KEPT 
CAPTIVE IN THE BASEMENT POLICE 
GAINED ACCESS AFTER JOSEF GAVE A 
SPECIAL CODE 
THERE IS A VERY VERY SMALL DOOR HAVE YOU TO BEND YOUR 
HEAD BEHIND THAT THERE'S A NARROW 
CORRIDOR AND ROOMS THAT WERE USED 
FOR SLEEPING WHERE YOU COULD COOK 
ON SMALL HOT PLATES 
DETAILS IN THE 
CASE EMERGED AFTER ONE OF THE 
CHILDREN NINETEEN YEAR OLD KIR STEN WAS 
TAKEN TO THIS HOSPITAL A WEEK AGO 
DOCTORS APPEALED FOR HER MOTHER TO 
COME FORWARD AT THAT POINT JOSEF 
DECIDED TO RELEASE HER AND TWO 
OTHER CHILDREN'S THE CASE HAS 
BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES OF NATASCHA 
KAMPUSCH WHO WAS LOCKED IN A HOUSE 
IN AUSTRIA FOR EIGHT YEARS N. A 
SMALL QUIET TOWN OF AMSTETTEN 
THEY'RE IN SHOCK THIS NEIGHBOUR 
CAN'T BELIEVE NO ONE NOTICED 
ANYTHING FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS AT THE SCENE 
OFFICERS ARE CONTINUING THEIR 
SEARCH OF THE HOUSE AND CELLAR 
THEY'RE CARRYING OUT D. N. A. TESTS ON 
JOSEF TO FIND OUT IF HE IS THE 
FATHER OF THE SIX CHILDREN 
LEAVING YOUR CHILDREN WITH A NEW 
NANNY OR CHILD MINDER CAN BE A BIT 
WORRYING BUT IT SEEMS MANY PARENTS 
ARE DECIDING NOT TO LEAVE ANYTHING 
TO CHANCE SALES OF HIDDEN CAMERAS 
SO CALLED NANNY CAMS ARE ON THE 
INCREASE EBAY SAY THEY'RE SELLING 
HUNDREDS EVERY MONTH AND ANOTHER 
ONLINE RETAILER SAYS SALES OF THE 
CAMERAS HAVE GONE UP BY FIFTY PER CENT OVER 
THE LAST YEAR 
RETURN TO WORK AND LEAVING YOUNG 
CHILDREN IN THE CARE OF OTHERS CAN 
BE AN ANXIOUS TIME BUT THE LATEST 
TECHNOLOGY MEANS PARENTS CAN KEEP 
AN EYE ON THEIR CHILDREN FROM A 
DISTANCE AT THIS NURSERY IN NORTH 
LONDON THEY'RE INSTALLED VIDEO 
CAMERAS WHICH CONSTANTLY RECORD 
WHAT'S GOING ON 
HE'S AT THE TABLE 
EATING CAKE THERE HE IS 
AT HOME 
OR WORK PARENTS CAN LOG ONTO A 
SECURE WEBSITE AND SEE HOW WELL 
THEIR CHILDREN ARE BEING TREATED I I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE HOW HE 
ADJUSTED IN HIS NEW ENVIRONMENT IT 
WAS WONDERFUL TO WATCH HIM AND SEE 
HE'S O. K. 
THIS CAMERA HAS BEEN 
FITTED INTO ALL THESE ITEMS SOME SOME PARENTS HAVE BEGUN TAKING THIS TO A 
NEW LEVEL SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING AFTER THEIR 
CHILDREN THEY'RE INSTALLING 
CAMERAS HIDDEN IN CLOCKS OR TOYS IN 
THEIR HOMES 
IF YOUR CHILD'S NOT 
YET AT SCHOOL AND YOU'VE EMPLOYED 
SOMEONE TO LOCK AFTER YOUR CHILD AT 
HOME THEN THAT CHILD BECOMES MAYBE 
LESS HAPPY THE BEHAVIOUR CHANGES 
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT'S A 
PARANOID PERSON WANT TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THE PERSON LOOKING AFTER THEIR 
CHILD CAN BE TRUSTED 
THE TREND FOR 
INSTALLING NANNY CAMS BEGAN IN THE 
U. S. THESE MUCH PUBLICISED IMAGES 
APPEAR TO SHOW A NANNY NEGLECTING A 
BABY SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING 
AFTER THE TECHNOLOGY SEEMS TO BE 
BECOMING MORE POPULAR HERE THE 
IMAGES FROM THESE CAMERAS CAN BE 
RECORDED FOR PARENTS TO WATCH WHEN 
THEY GET HOME OR CAN BE VIEWED LIVE 
VIA A COMPUTER OR A MONITOR 
LEGALLY WE'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE 
HIDDEN CAMERAS IN OUR HOMES AND 
WHAT THEY RECORD CAN BE USED TO 
PROSECUTE BAD CARERS BUT THOSE WHO 
REPRESENT NANNIES SAY THEY'RE 
CONCERNED 
YOU SELECT A FULLY CONCERNED TRAINED NANNY WHO'S BEEN FULLY 
VETTED YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE CONCERNS 
OR NEED THESE CAMERAS OR NEED TO 
SPY ON PEOPLE WHILE THEY'RE WORKING 
SOME OF THESE PARENTS WOULDN'T BE 
HAPPY IF THEY WERE BEING WATCHED 
WHILE DOING THEIR WORK 
THE CAMERAS 
DON'T PROTECT CHILDREN AND THE 
IMAGES THEY RECORD CAN DISTORT 
WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING DESPITE 
THIS MANY PARENTS SEEM KEEN 
TOMORROW BRACE ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY 
WHICH THEY FEEL GIVES THEM PEACE OF 
MIND MIND BRITAIN'S VOTING SYSTEM IS OPEN TO 
LARGE SCALE FRAUD AND FALLS SHORT 
OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS 
ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT THE 
JOSEPH ROWNTREE REFORM TRUST CLAIMS 
MEASURES TO INCREASE TURNOUT ARE 
PUTTING THE INTEGRITY OF THE

SAYS IT HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS 
TO STOP FRAUD 
DELIVERIES OF FUEL HAVE BEGAN 
ARRIVING BY SEA AT THE GRANGEMOUTH 
OIL REFINERY THE STOPPAGE IS 
ENTERING ITS SECOND DAY IT APPEARS 
ONLY A HANDFUL OF SCOTLAND'S 
FILLING STATIONS HAVE RUN OUT OF 
FUEL LORNA GORDON IS THERE FOR US 
TODAY TODAY WE ARE HALF WAY THROUGH THIS STRIKE

COMPETITIVE IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY

GOOD FOR MAN U. IS IT 
NOTHING IS 
WHEN YOU LOSE IT'S A WEE TIGHT FOR 
EVERYONE SCOTLAND RANGERS AND 
CELTIC NOW MANCHESTER UNITED AND 
CHELSEA IT WILL GO DOWN TO THE 
WIRE WIRE A MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH IN THE 
TREATMENT OF BLINDNESS MAY OFFER 
HOPE TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE HEREDITARY EYE COMPLAINTS 
DOCTORS SUCCESSFULLY INJECTED 
HEALTHY GENES INTO THE EYES OF SEVENTEEN 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD STEPHEN HOWARTH PALLAB 
GHOSH ASKED HOW THE TREATMENT HAS 
CHANGED HIS LIFE 
IT HAS MADE LIKE 
BECAUSE I PLAY GUITAR IT HAS MADE 
THE FRET BAR A BIT CLEARER THAN 
WHAT IT USED TO BE WE DO GIGINGS 
AT COLLEGE OCCASIONALLY INSTEAD OF 
JUST STANDING STILL IN ONE PLACE 
BECAUSE I COULDN'T SEE TO MOVE 
AROUND I TEND TO MOVE AROUND MORE 
NOW THAN WHAT I USED TO WHAT I 
WANT TO DO ONE THING I'M AIMING 
FOR IS TO GET A JOB IN A MUSIC 
STUDIO A PRACTICE ROOM SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT EVENTUALLY MOVE OUT GET 
MY OWN PLACE 
IT MUST HAVE GIVEN 
YOU A REAL BOOST TO YOUR 
CONFIDENCE 
IT'S GOOD BECAUSE I CONFIDENCE USED TO BE DEAD SHY LIKE SILENT 
NOW THAT I'VE GOT CONFIDENCE TO 
WALK AROUND ON MY OWN PROFESSOR PROFESSOR JOHN MARSHALL IS A LEADING EYE 
SPECIALIST AND SOPHIE MONTGOMERY IS 
AN ARTIST WHO IS PARTIALLY SIGHTED 
DUE TO A GENETIC CONDITION THIS 
SEEMS SOMETHING QUITE REMARKABLE 
YES I'VE BEEN CHAIRMAN OF THE 
MEDICAL ADVISORY BOARD OF THIS 
PATIENT GROUP FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS FOR THIRTY FIVE 
YEARS I'VE ESSENTIALLY WATCHED MANY 
OF MY FRIENDS GO BLIND THIS 
TREATMENT OFFERS THE FIRST REAL 
SCIENTIFICICALLY BASED HOPE FOR 
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FAMILIES IN THE U. K. 
HOW DOES 
IT WORK 
WELL ALL THESE GENETIC 
DISORDERS ARE RELATED TO FAULTY 
GENES FOR SOME REASON THE GENES 
MESS UP THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CELL 
IT'S LIKE AN AREA IN A RECIPE 
SAYING A CUP OF SALT INSTEAD OF A 
PINCH OF SALT FOR SOME REASON THAT 
CHEMICAL ERROR KILLS THE CELLS AND 
ROBS THESE INDIVIDUALS OF THE 
ABILITY TO SEE THIS TREATMENT 
REPLACES THE DEFECTIVE RECIPE AS 
IT WERE WITH THE REAL RECIPE IT 
SWITCHES THE CELLS BACK ON AGAIN 
SOPHIE YOU HAD LATE ONSET R. P. 
GENETIC BLINDNESS HOW DOES THAT 
AFFECT YOU 
AT MOMENT I'M AFFECTED 
PARTICULARLY IN THE DARK L. THINK 
BASICALLY YOU USE YOUR RODS MORE 
WHEN IN LOW LEVEL LIGHT AND IT'S 
THE RODS THAT START GOING FIRST 
I'VE LOST A LOT OF MY PERIPHERAL 
VISION AT THE MOMENT I'VE REALLY 
GOT MAINLY CENTRAL VISION LEFT 
THIS COULD HAVE HUGE IMPACT ON 
YOU THIS PROGRESS AND ALSO YOUR 
CHILDREN 
HUGE ACTUALLY MY BIGGEST CHILDREN MOTIVATION IS MY CHILDREN I'VE GOT 
FOUR CHILDREN THEY STAND A FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. 
CHANCE OF GETTING THE CONDITION L. 
WOULD DEARLY LIKE TO SAVE THEM FROM 
HAVING TO GO THROUGH THIS L. CAN'T 
DRIVE FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN I LOST 
MY ABILITY TO DRIVE ABOUT NINE 
YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS FIRST 
DIAGNOSED I'VE GOT TOO MANY BLIND 
SPOTS 
YOU'RE AN ARTIST I MEAN SPOTS THAT 
I'M A PAINTER SO THERE'S A THAT CERTAIN IRONY YES 
HOW HAS IT 
AFFECTED YOUR WORK 
IT'S DIFFICULT 
TO KNOW AT THIS STAGE IT'S I MEAN 
IT WILL CERTAINLY EVOLVE IN A 
DIFFERENT WAY TO IT MIGHT HAVING 
EVOLVED HAD I NOT HAD THIS PROBLEM 
I MEAN CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF 
CONTRASTS AND SUBTLETIES AND THE 
WAY I PERCEIVE COLOUR I THINK THAT 
WILL ALL CHANGE ALSO WORKING ON A 
VERY BIG SCALE IS ANOTHER ISSUE TOO 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I CAN ONLY SEE 
PART OF A PICTURE L. WON'T BE ABLE 
TO SEE THE WHOLE THING SO YES 
AND OBVIOUSLY I MEAN THE BIGGEST 
FEAR IS REALLY GOING COMPLETELY 
BLIND 
JOHN THIS WILL HOPEFULLY BLIND HELP PEOPLE WITH GENETIC BLINDNESS 
DOES IT GET US CLOSER TO A CURE FOR 
BLINDNESS AS A WHOLE WELL WELL BLINDNESS CAN OCCUR FOR MANY 
DIFFERENT REASONS IN DIFFERENT 
PARTS OF THE EYE BUT IT'S 
INCREASINGLY CLOR THAT THE GENETIC 
MAKE UP OF INDIVIDUALS IS A VERY 
STRONG ELEMENT IN PRE DISPOSITION 
AND THE RATE AT WHICH THEY LOSE 
THEIR VISION THE MAJOR CAUSE OF 
BLINDNESS IN THE WHOLE OF THE 
WESTERN WORLD IS SOMETHING CALLED 
AGE RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION 
THIS AFFECTS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WE 
KNOW THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT GENETIC 
COMPONENT SO THIS POTENTIALLY 
OPENS UP THE WAY TO TREAT MANY 
DIFFERENT BLINDING CONDITIONS IT 
INVOLVES MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
WORLDWIDE 
PROFESSOR JOHN MARSHALL WORLDWIDE SOPHIE MONTGOMERY THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH MUCH LET'S LOCK AT THE TIME SIX HUNDRED FORTY THREE THESE 
ARE THE MAIN STORIES THIS MORNING 
THERE'S HOPE FOR MILLIONS WHO'VE 
LOST THEIR SIGHT AS BRITISH 
DOCTORS USE GENE THERAPY TO REVERSE 
ONE FORM OF BLINDNESS 
AUSTRIAN POLICE ARE QUESTIONING A 
MAN WHO ALLEGEDLY HELD THINKS 
DAUGHTER CAPTIVE IN THE CELLAR FOR 
TWENTY FOUR YEARS AND FATHERED SEVEN 
CHILDREN WITH HER 
COMING UP LATER THESE LITTLE 
PIGLETS ARE SELLING FOR ONE THOUSAND EACH 
WE'RE NOT TELLING PORKIES JOHN 
TELLS US WHY 
THEY MAY BE TINY 
ONLY ABOUT A FIFTH OF THE SIZE OF A 
NORMAL PIG BUT INTEREST IN THEM 
WORLDWIDE IS HUGE THEY'RE GETTING 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND HITS ON THEIR WEBSITE EVERY 
DAY WHO COULD RESIST SUCH A CUTE 
FACE 
WHEN HE SAID THAT I THOUGHT HE 
MUST BE TALKING ABOUT CAROL 
GOOD 
MORNING WELL THIS MORNING IT'S NOT 
A BAD START TO THE DAY IT DOESN'T 
FEEL COLD FOR MOST OF US ARE THERE 
ONE OR TWO EXCEPTIONS FOR MANY 
PARTS OF THE K. U. N. TRIT FORECAST IS 
ONE OF SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS SOME 
OF THE SHOWERS COULD BE HEAVY WITH 
HAIL AND THUNDER MIXED IN ON THE 
RADAR PICTURE WHICH GOES BACK 
ABOUT TWELVE HOURS YOU CAN SEE THE 
RAIN WE HAD IN THE NORTH EAST OF 
ENGLAND THAT CAUSED LOCAL FLOOD 
ANYTHING YORKSHIRE IT HAS MOVED 
INTO SCOTLAND IT'S POTENT IN THE 
NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND AT THE 
MOMENT BY NINE A M. THAT RAIN WILL 
STILL VERY MUCH BE WITH US WITH 
SNOW ON THE HIS QUITE HILLS 
ACROSS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND QUITE A 
LOT OF CLOUD WITH SHOWERS MOVING 
INTO THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND SOME 
BREAKS IN THE CLOUD INTO THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AGAIN SOME 
SHOWERS AROUND AND THE SOUTH WEST 
OF ENGLAND AND WALES CONTINUING 
WITH THE SHOWERS THROUGH THE DAY 
AND SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY FORMING 
LINES OF SHOWERS SO THEY WILL BE 
SLOW MOVING THE WIND NOT AS STRONG 
AND COMING FROM A DIFFERENT 
DIRECTION SHOWERS TOO ACROSS 
NIERPLD NOT JUST THIS MORNING BUT 
AS WE GO THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
DAY SO SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS FOR 
MOST IS THE FORECAST IF YOU'RE IN 
THE SUNSHINE WITH THE WINDS BEING 
LIGHT IT WON'T FEEL TOO BAD NOT 
AS WARM AS THE WEEKEND OF COURSE 
WHEN WE HIT TWENTY TWO CELSIUS TODAY THE 
MAXIMUM IS ABOUT SIXTEEN THE RAIN IN 
SCOTLAND WILL BE HEAVY ESPECIALLY 
ACROSS ABERDEENSHIRE AND MURRAY 
THAT RAIN MOVES NORTHWARDS THROUGH 
THE NIGHT EVENTUALLY CLEARING THE 
NORTHERN ISLES BEHIND IT A DRIER 
PICTURE THE SHOWERS DYING AWAY BY 
DAWN THE CLOUD WILL BE ENCROACHING 
IN THE SOUTH WESTERN CORNER 
THROUGH THE MORNING THAT WILL BE 
FOLLOWED BY HEAVY RAIN HEAVY RAIN 
THROUGH THE SOUTH WEST EDGING OVER 
TO THE SOUTH EAST THAT WILL BE 
ACCOMPANIED BY GUSTY WINDS AS WELL 
IT WILL FEEL MUCH COOLER IN THE 
SOUTH THAN IT HAS OF LATE FOR THE 
REST OF US ANOTHER DAY OF SUNSHINE 
AND SHOWERS YOU BUT BRIGHTER IN THE 
NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND COMPARED TO 
TODAY 
HELLO GOOD MORNING EVERYONE 
ANOTHER BIG BANK IS ABOUT TO LINE 
UP AND TELL US IT NEEDS BILLIONS 
FROM ITS SHARE SHAREHOLDERS IT 
IS HBOS WE KNOW THERE ARE LOT OF 
VIEWERS WHO HAVE HALIFAX SHARES 
WHEN IT CHANGED FROM A BUILDING 
SOCIETY TO A BANK MANY YEARS AGO 
IF YOU HAVE SHARES THE CHANCES ARE 
YOU WILL GET LETTER SOON TO 
INVITE YOU TO BUY NEW SHARES IN THE 
COMPANY THESE NEW SHARES YOU WILL 
GET AT A DISCOUNT THEY WILL BE AT 
A LOWER PRICE THAN THE CURRENT 
MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES F. YOU 
DON'T TAKE UP THE RIGHTS TO BUY 
THOSE SHARES THOSE RIGHTS WILL BE 
PASSED ON TO SOMEONE ELSE LET'S 
SPEAK TO BRIAN CAPLAN FROM THE 
BANKER MAGAZINE YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
BUY THESE NEW SHARES BUT THEY WILL 
BE AT A CHEAP PRICE THAT IS RIGHT 
BE AT A CHEAP PRICE THAT IS RIGHT 
IT IS A CONVENTIONAL WAY TO RAISE 
MONEY IN THE MARKETS YOU ARE 
OFFERED THEM AT AN ATTRACTIVE 
DISCOUNT USUALLY IT IS ATTRACTIVE 
TO BUY THEM YOU TAKE A VIEW ON THE 
FUTURE SHARE PRICE OF THE COMPANY 
IT IS THOUGHT THEY WILL TRY AND 
RAISE FOUR BILLION 
THEY ARE BEING 
CAUTIOUS HBOS'S CAPITAL DOES NOT 
LOOK TOO BAD AT THE MOMENT IT IS 
ABOVE THE REGULATORY MINIMUM THEY 
ARE PREDICTING SINGLE DIG GET FALLS 
IN THE HOUSE PRICES IN THE 
IS THE BANK MOST EXPOSED TO THE 
HOUSING MARKET 
THIS IS OUR OLD 
FRIEND PRUDENCE THEY ARE FATTENING 
UP THAT CUSHION INSTEAD OF HARD 
TIMES AHEAD 
THEY FACE A DILEMMA 
THEY COULD TRY AND RIDE IT OUT LIKE 
BARCLAYS HAVE THEY FACE THE RISK 
THEY MIGHT HAVE TO COME BACK TO 
MARKETS LATER WHICH WILL MAKE THEM 
MORE UNPOPULAR 
IS FOUR BILLION 
ENOUGH THERE WAS A BIT IN THE 
PAPERS SAYING THEY MIGHT HAVE TO 
ASK UP TO ELEVEN BILLION 
THAT IS 
CORRECT THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE 
MARKETS IN SUCH VOLATILE CONDITIONS 
AND DETERIORATING THE ASSETS HBOS 
HOLD THEY ARE BEING REVALUED ALL 
THE TIME WHETHER IT IS ENOUGH 
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE 
THANK YOU THEY 
ARE EXPECTED TO CUT THE VALUE OF 
INVESTMENTS THEY HAVE MADE IN 
THINGS LIKE AMERICAN MORTGAGE DEBT 
THAT COULD LEAD TO LOSSES OF THREE 
BILLION THANK YOU FOR MOST PEOPLE 
READING THE SUNDAY PAPERS IS A TIME 
TO RELAX AND UNWIND FOR THE PRIME 
MINISTER IT WAS ANYTHING BUT HE 
CAME IN FOR A MAULING I THINK YOU 
WOULD SAY AT THE HANDS OF A FORMER 
DONOR AND CLOSE ALLIE LORD LEVY 
THIS OVER THE TUFPLT TURN ON THE 
TEN P. ROW AND DETENTION OF TERROR 
SUSPECTS POLLS SHOW GORDON BROWN'S 
POPULARNESS IS SLIDING HOW IS THIS 
LOOKING AHEAD OF THE LONDON MAYORAL 
ELECTIONS KEVIN MAGUIRE AND ANDREW 
PIERCE JOIN US THERE IS A BIG 
STORY ABOUT LORD LEVY SAYING TONY 
BLAIR SAYS GORDON BROWN WILL NEVER 
WIN AGAINST DAVID CAMERON DO YOU 
THINK HE WILL BE WOUNDED BY THAT 
IT IS DAMAGING IT ADDS TO THE 
IMPRESSION THAT PEOPLE IN THE 
LABOUR PARTY THINK THEY HAVE A LONG 
ONE LEVY WAS IMMENSELY CLOSE TO 
GORDON BROWN YOU TEND TO THINK P. 
THAT IS WHY BLAIR HUNG AROUND SO 
LONG DESPERATE TO FIND ANYONE BUT 
GORDON WE KNOW CHERRY WAS THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE ANYONE BUT GORDON 
CLUB NOW WE HAVE FURTHER EVIDENCE 
THAT TONY BLAIR DID NOT TRUST 
GORDON BROWN DO TO THE JOB LOOKING 
AT THE POLLS IT LOOKS LIKE HE MIGHT 
BE RIGHT 
IT TUNES WITH THE TIME L. 
CAN IMAGINE BLAIR SAYING THAT AT 
SOME POINT L. CAN IMAGINE HIM 
SAYING THE OPPOSITE ON OTHER 
OCCASIONS THEY WERE LIKE LOVERS AT 
TIMES WHO USED TO HAVE THESEIVES 
JUST THE THOUGHT 
AS A LABOUR M. P. 
SAID TO ME IF YOU WOULD PICK YOUR 
ENEMIES LORD CASHPOINT WOULD BE A 
PICK HE WAS MIXED ONE ALL THOSE 
ALLEGATIONS OF SLEAZE 
COULD IT BE 
THE OTHER STUFF WHICH COULD BE 
DAMAGING IN THE LONG RUN LIKE THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX BAND WHICH 
TURNED AROUND AND BIT EVERYONE ON 
THE BUM WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED NOT 
MANY SAID IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM 
BUT WHEN IT CAME INTO THE PAY 
PACKETS 
GORDON BROWN WANTED TO PACKETS HAVE A TWO P. IN THE ONE CUT PEOPLE NOW 
HAVE IN THEIR PACKETS YOU WOULD 
NEVER KNOW IT THAT WENT TO THE 
HEART OF WHAT GORDON BROWN IS 
SUPPOSED TO STAND FOR HELPING THE 
POOR IT WITH TUZ POOREST HURT BY 
IT LABOUR M. P.'S ARE LOOKING AT AND 
THINKING WHAT DO WE STAND FOR 
GORDON NOT TONY BLAIR IS ATTACKING 
THE POOREST PEOPLE AND FOR GORDON 
THEN HE WAS IN AMERICA SAYING 
THERE WAS NO PROBLEM THEN HE MAKES 
ONE OF THE WORST PERFORMANCES AT 
PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS TRYING 
TO DEFEND IT 
THE PERCEPTION AMONG 
A LOT OF PEOPLE IS YOU HAVE A PRIME 
MINISTER STUMBLING FROM ONE CRISIS 
TO ANOTHER 
HE IS FRANK SPENCER 
THE TORY BOY IS WRONG ON THAT T. IT 
IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT HE MISSED 
THAT CORE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 
LOWER PAID POORER WORKERS WHO IF 
GORDON BROWN HAS AN INNER CORE 
HELPING THEM IS WHAT HE IS ALL 
ABOUT YES THERE ARE A SERIES OF 
PROBLEMS COMING ALONG TEN P. TAXES 
THERE HE SEEMS TO HAVE LOST HIS 
TOUCH HE DOES NOT LOOK COMPETENT T. 
ECONOMY IS RUNNING INTO TROUBLE HE 
WILL HAVE BIG PROBLEMS ON HIS PLANS 
TO EXTEND TRIAL DETENTION WITHOUT 
TRIAL FOR FORTY TWO DAYS EVERYTHING WILL 
FOCUS ON WHETHER KEN LIVINGSTONE 
WINS AGAIN IN LONDON IF HE DOES 
LABOUR WILL ARGUE LOOK CAMERON 
KAPLG IS TOT WIN AFTER ALL THOSE 
PROBLEMS OF GORDON BROWN WE HAVE 
MENTIONED OF COURSE IF KEN 
LIVINGSTONE LOSING AND BORIS 
JOHNSON WINS THEN I SUSPECT 
THERE'LL BE A ROT MORE PANIC ON 
THOSE LABOUR BENCHES

MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ROUND THE WORLD 
FOR THE FIRST TIME BRITISH 
SCIENTISTS HAVE MANAGED TO REVERSE 
BLINDNESS USING GENE THERAPY OUR 
SIGN CORRESPONDENT PALLAB GHOSH HAS 
HAD EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO THAT TRIAL 
SIX MONTHS AGO STEPHEN HOWARTH 
COULD HARDLY SEE IN THE DARK NOW 
THANKS TO A PIONEERING OPERATION 
HIS SIGHT HAS BEGUN TO IMPROVE 
SCIENTISTS HERE ARE ASSESSING 
STEPHEN'S VISION BY MAKING HIM WALK 
THROUGH THIS DIMLY LIT MAZE THIS 
IS WHAT HE WAS LIKE SHORTLY AFTER 
HIS OPERATION HE KEEPS BUMPING 
INTO THE WALLS IT TAKES ONE MINUTE 
SEVENTEEN SECONDS TO GET TO THE END BUT 
SIX MONTHS LATER JUST LOOK AT THE 
TRANSFORMATION STRAIGHT THROUGH IN 
JUST FOURTEEN SECONDS 
SOCIAL LIFE REALLY 
HAS IMPROVED NOT MUCH BUT SLIGHTLY 
I CAN DO MORE THAN WHAT I USED TO 
LIKE AT NIGHT I'VE GOT MORE SELF 
CONFIDENCE 
STEPHEN'S EYE SIGHT WAS CONFIDENCE FAILING BECAUSE OF A FAULTY GENE 
SURGEONS AT MOOR FIELDS HOSPITAL 
INJECTED GOOD COPIES OF THE GENE 
INTO THE BACK OF THE EYE THE GENES 
HAVE HEALED THE DYING CELLS AND 
IMPROVED STEPHEN'S SIGHT FOLLOWING 
THEIR SUCCESS WITH STEPHEN THE 
RESEARCHERS HOPE TO TRY OUT THEIR 
GENE THERAPY ON CHILDREN THEY HOPE 
IT WILL HELP THEM TOO SO THEY CAN 
GROW UP AND LEAD THEIR LIVES TO 
THEIR FULL POTENTIAL ABDULLAHI IS 
ELEVEN HE HOPE THAT'S HE'LL BE PICKED 
FOR THE NEXT PHASE OF THE TRIAL SO

BACK FOR HER 
YOU'D LIKE TO HELP 
YOUR MUM A BIT MORE YEAH IT'S YEAH IT'S EARLY DAYS FOR THE RESEARCH BUT 
THE SCIENTISTS INVOLVED HOPE THAT 
GENE THERAPY COULD EVENTUALLY BE 
USED TO TREAT A WIDE RANGE OF SIGHT 
DISORDERS DISORDERS POLICE IN AUSTRIA ARE INVESTIGATING

EXPLAINING YOUR ACTIONS ANG FROM 
THE PUBLIC

OF WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IT'S SO 
PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND PROPERLY 
THIS ISN'T ABOUT A TRADE UNION 
INITIATIVE IT'S ABOUT A DEMAND BY 
AN EMPLEEEE THAT WE ACCEPT THE 
CLOSING OF PENSION SCHEME 
WE HAVE 
SEEN TANKERS LEAVING THIS MORNING 
TRYING TO SPREAD THE FUEL 
THROUGHOUT SCOTLAND THERE HAVE 
BEEN DIFFICULTIES 
THAT'S FINE 
THEY'RE LEAVING BECAUSE WE'VE 
AGREED THAT ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES 
SHOULD GET OUT DURING THIS PERIOD 
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO HIT THE 
VULNERABLE OR THE PEOPLE OF 
SCOTLAND THE STRIKE'S WITH INEOS 
WHAT'S STANDING IN THE WAY OF 
NEGOTIATIONS 
WE'RE GOING 
TO BACK NEGOTIATIONS TO WORK TOMORROW WE WANT TO 
NEGOTIATE WE WON'T GIVE IN ON THIS 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ESCALATE IT BUT

THE GATES FIVE SEVENTY NINE A M. TOMORROW 
LEAVING YOUR CHILDREN WITH A NEW 
NANNY OR CHILD MINDER CAN BE 
WORRYING SO IT SEEMS MANY PARENTS 
ARE DECIDING NOT TO LEAVE ANYTHING 
TO CHANCE SALES OF HIDDEN CAMERAS 
NANNY KAPLDZ ARE ON THE CIENESS 
EBAY SAY THEY'RE SELLING HUNDREDS 
EACH MONTH ANOTHER ONLINE RETAILER 
SAY SALES HAVE GONE UP BY FIFTY PER CENT OVER 
THE PAST YEAR 
RETURN TO WORK AND LEAVING YOUNG 
CHILDREN IN THE CARE OF OTHERS CAN 
BE AN ANXIOUS TIME THE LATEST 
TECHNOLOGY MEANS PARENTS CAN KEEP 
AN EYE ON THEIR CHILDREN FROM A 
DISTANCE AT THIS NURSERY IN NORTH 
LONDON THEY'VE INSTALLED VIDEO 
CAMERAS WHICH CONSTANTLY RECORD 
WHAT'S GOING ON 
HE'S AT THE TABLE 
EATING CAKE 
AT HOME OR WORK 
PARENTS LIKE ODETTE CAN LOG ON TO A 
SECURE WEBSITE AND SEE HOW WELL 
THEIR CHILDREN ARE BEING TREATED I I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE HOW HE 
ADJUSTED IN HIS NEW ENVIRONMENT IT 
WAS WONDERFUL TO WATCH HIM AND SEE 
THAT HE'S O. K. 
THIS VIDEO CAMERA 
HERE HAS BEEN FITTED INTO ALL OF 
THESE ITEMS 
SOME PARENTS HAVE 
BEGUN TAKING THIS TO A WHOLE NEW 
LEVEL SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
PEOPLE LOOKING AFTER THEIR CHILDREN 
THAT THEY'RE INSTALLING CAMERAS 
HIDDEN IN CLOCKS OR TOYS IN THEIR 
HOMES 
IF YOUR CHILD'S NOT YET AT HOMES SCHOOL AND YOU'VE EMPLOYED SOMEONE 
TO LOCK AFTER YOUR CHILD AT HOME 
AND THEN THAT CHILD BECOMES LESS 
HAPPY THE BEHAVIOUR CHANGES YOU 
KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT'S A 
PARANOID PERSON WANT TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THE PERSON LOOKING AFTER THEIR 
CHILD CAN BE TRUSTED 
THE TREND FOR 
INSTALLING NANNY CAMS BEGAN IN THE 
U. S. THESE MUCH PUBLICISED IMAGES 
APPEAR TO SHOW A NANNY NEGLECTING A 
BABY THE TECHNOLOGY SEEMS TO BE 
BECOMING MORE POPULAR HERE THE 
IMAGES FROM THESE CAMERAS CAN BE 
RECORDED FOR PARENTS TO WATCH WHEN 
THEY GET HOME OR VIEWED LIVE VIA 
COMPUTER OR MONITOR LEGALLY WE'RE 
ALLOWED TO HAVE HIDDEN CAMERAS IN 
OUR HOMES AND WHAT THEY RECORD CAN 
BE USED TO PROSECUTE BAD CARERS 
BUT THOSE WHO REPRESENT NANNIES SAY 
THEY'RE CONCERNED 
YOU SELECT A 
FULLY TRAINED NANNY WHO'S BEEN 
FULLY VETTED YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE 
CONCERNS OR NEED THESE CAMERAS YOU 
SHOULDN'T NEED TO SPY ON PEOPLE 
WHILE WORK I'M SURE SOME OF THESE 
PARENTS WOULDN'T BE HAPPY IF THEY 
WERE BEING SPYED ON WHILE THEY WERE 
WORKING 
THE CAMERAS DON'T PROTECT WORKING CHILDREN AND THE IMAGES THEY RECORD 
CAN DISTORT WHAT'S ACTUALLY 
HAPPENING DESPITE THIS MANY 
PARENTS SEEM KEEN TO EMBRACE ANY 
NEW TECHNOLOGY WHICH THEY FEEL 
GIVES THEM PEACE OF MIND 
WE'RE DISCUSSING THAT STORY AT 
SEVEN FORTY A M. IF YOU USE NANNY CAMS AND 
YOU THINK THEY WORK LET US KNOW 
BRITAIN'S VOTING SYSTEM IS OPEN TO 
LARGE SCALE FRAUD AND FALLS SHORT 
OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS A NEW 
REPORT BY THE JOSEPH ROWNTREE 
REFORM TRUST SAYS POSTAL VOTING AND 
ELECTRONIC VOTING IS INCREASING THE 
RISK THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S 
TAKEN STEPS TO TRY TO AVOID FRAUD 
THE MAJOR FOUR SUPERMARKETS SAY 
THEY'RE HAPPY TO HELP WITH ALLEGED 
PRICE FIXING THE ALLEGATIONS ARE 
THOUGHT TO CENTRE ON THE STORES 
SWAPING INFORMATION ON PRICES ON 
HEALTH AND BEAUTY RO DUCTS AS WELL 
AS GROCERIES 
ALL SUPERMARKETS COMPETE WITH WITH 
THE OTHER JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE 
COMPETITIVE IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY 
COULDN'T BE MORE COMPETITIVE JUST 
BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPETING IT 
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT 
PRICES ARE AS LOW AS THEY MIGHT BE 
SO COMPETITION IS RELATIVE THING 
YOU SPEND MONTHS WAITING FOR A TURT 
AM AND THEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM COME 
ALONG THESE ENDANGERED OLIVE 
RIDLEY TURTLES HATCHED ON I BEACH 
IN EASTERN INDIA ONE OF THE 
WORLD'S LARGEST NESTING GROUNDS 
DESPITE LOCAL EFFORTS TO HELP THE 
BABIES ONLY ONE OUT OF EVERY 
THOUSAND NORMALLY REACHES ADULTHOOD 
ONLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OF THOSE TURTLES THERE 
WILL MAKE IT THOSE ARE THE 
MORNING'S TOP STORIES LET'S TELL 
YOU WHAT'S COMING UP WE'RE LIVE 
FROM THE NORFOLK BROADS WHERE 
RESIDENTS ARE WORRIED THEIR HOMES 
ARE BEING SURRENDERED TO THE SEA 
FIRST THOUGH KIM COOLING WAS SO 
UPSET BY THE STRAY DOGS SHE SAW 
WHEN ON HOLIDAY IN SRI LANKA SIXTEEN 
YEARS AGO SHE SET UP A CHARITY TO 
FIND THEM LOVING HOMES IN THE U. K. 
SHE'S JUST RETURNED FROM HER LATEST 
TRIP ONE OF THE PUPPIES SHE 
RESCUED MILLY NIPPED HER IN 
QUARANTINE THAT PUPPY TURNED OUT 
TO HAVE RABIES KIM'S HERE NOW 
LOOKING ALL RIGHT WHAT HAPPENED 
I'D LIKE TO SAY TO START WITH THAT 
OUR U. K. REGISTERED CHARITY WHICH WAS 
SET UP LAST YEAR WAS SET UP TO 
ACTUALLY HELP THE ANIMALS IN SRI 
LANKA CHARITY FUNDS HAVE NEVER 
BEEN USED TO IMPORT A DOG INTO THIS 
COUNTRY BASICALLY THE SITUATION IN 
SRI LANKA FOR THE ANIMALS IS DIRE 
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU 
WELL WE DID 
BRING SOME DOGS BACK ON THIS TRIP 
ONE OF THEM WAS MILLY WHO WAS 
SCREENED IN SRI LANKA BY VARIOUS 
VETS WE HAD HER BLOOD TESTED AND 
VARIOUS BLOOD TESTS ACTUALLY SHE 
WAS GIVEN A HEALTH CERTIFICATE SHE 
WAS INOCULATED AGAINST RABIES IT IT TURNED OUT SHE DID HAVE RABIES SHE SHE WAS HARBOURING THE DISEASE SHE 
BECAME ILL FORTY EIGHT HOURS BEFORE SHE DIED 
AND BIT YOU IS THIS MILLY YES YES SHE NIPPED ME ON MONDAY I WENT TO 
SEE HER AND SHE WAS FINE AND 
PLAYING WITH THE OTHER PUPS ON 
WEDNESDAY HER DEMEANOUR CHANGED AND 
SHE BECAME QUITE SNAPPY SHE HAD 
PROBLEMS WALKING HER LEGS SEEMED 
TO BE WEAK L. ACTUALLY ALERTED THE 
VETS TO HER AS I SAY SHE REALLY 
SORT OF WENT DOWN HILL FROM THAT 
AND SHE DIED FRIDAY ALL ANIMALS 
WHO DIE IN QUARANTINE THEY ARE 
DECAPITATED THEIR HEADS GO TO 
DEFRA AND THE BRAINS ARE EXAMINED 
FOR RABIES IT'S A MANDATORY 
REQUIREMENT THEN THAT EVENING WE 
HEARD THAT SHE HAD TESTED TESTED 
POSITIVE 
HOW ARE YOU 
I'M FINE POSITIVE WAS ALSO VACCINATED AGAINST RABIES 
BECAUSE I WORK WITH STREET ANIMALS 
I'VE DONE SELF FUNDED WORK FOR MANY 
YEARS HELPING THE STRAYS IN SRI 
LANKA BUT I HAVE NEEDED BOOSTER 
SHOTS 
EXPLAIN TO US THEN WHY SHOTS THESE DOGS WERE BROUGHT BACK YOU 
SAY YOU DON'T NORMALLY BRING THEM 
BACK TO THIS COUNTRY IS THAT 
RIGHT 
OUR CHARITY WAS SET UP TO RIGHT ACTUALLY GET A BASE OUT IN SRI 
LANKA TO CARRY OUT A RABIES 
VACCINATION PROGRAMME ALSO TO 
STERILISE STRAYS BECAUSE THERE'S 
DYING STRAYS EVERYWHERE ON THE 
STREETS IN SRI LANKA THERE'S 
PUPPIES DUMPED ON RUBBISH TIPS WITH 
THEIR EYES PECKED OUT BY CROWS 
IT'S A HORROR FOR ANY ANIMAL LOVER 
WE HAVE WE HAVE NOWHERE TO TAKE 
THESE ANIMALS TO WE FOUND MILLY IN 
THE MIDDLE OF ROAD WE DIDN'T WANT 
TO RUN HER OVER WE PICKED HER UP 
BUT THEN YOU HAVE AN ANIMAL THAT 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH 
THERE'S NO FACILITIES TO TAKE THESE 
ANIMALS TO TO ENSURE THEY HAVE A 
LIFE YOU'RE FACED WITH A VERY 
VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION THAT DO 
YOU PUT THESE ANIMALS TO SLEEP DO 
YOU LEAVE THEM ON THE STREETS THIS THIS HAS EXPOSED THE RISKS THAT YOU'RE 
RUNNING AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE FACING 
THERE WAS NO RISK BECAUSE THE 
ANIMAL DIED IN QUARANTINE WE HAVE 
SIX MONTHS QUARANTINE IN THIS 
COUNTRY TO PREVENT RABIES 
QUARANTINE IS ALL ABOUT RABIES 
NOTHING ELSE CONTAINING AN ANIMAL 
IN ISOLATION FOR SIX MONTHS TO SEE 
IF THEY SHOW ANY SIGNS WHAT WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THE DOGS ONCE YOU'VE 
LOOKED AFTER THEM 
THEY ALL HAVE 
HOMES I HAVE THREE RESCUED STREET 
DOGS WITH ME IN LONDON TWO HAD 
THEIR TAILS HACKED OFF 
SOME YOU 
BRING BACK SOME YOU LEAVE 
WE HELP 
A LOT OF DOGS OUT THERE BUT THE 
PUPPIES ARE VERY VULNERABLE THEY 
REALLY DON'T YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T 
SURVIVE WITHOUT THEIR MUMS 
ARE YOU 
GOING TO CARRY ON BRINGING DOGS 
BACK 
WE PLAN IF WE HAVE MORE BACK FUNDS TO ACTUALLY HELP THE ANIMALS 
OUT THERE WE WENT OUT THERE ON 
THIS TRIP TO LOOK FOR LAND SADLY 
WE'RE STILL SHORT OF FUNDS FOR OUR 
CLINIC WE WENT ON THIS TRIP TO 
LOOK FOR LAND FOR OUR PROJECT WHICH 
IS URGENTLY NEEDED 
FOR THE TIME 
BEING YOU WON'T BE BRINGING ANY 
MORE DOGS BACK 
WE DIDN'T PLAN TO 
ANY WAY OUR CHARITY HAS NEVER 
IT'S FOCUSED ON HELPING THE AN 
MILLIONS IN SRI LANKA THANK YOU

SINKING SEA LEVELS ARE RISING 
LARGE AREAS COULD BE SUBMERGED 
BEFORE THE TURN OF THE CENTURY ONE 
SUCH AREA IS THE BOUFL NORFOLK 
BROADS ONE ENTREPRENEUR HAS COME 
UP WITH AN ASTONISHING SCHEME TO 
BUILD A GIANT BARRIER ACROSS THE 
WASH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING 
AT THE MOMENT WE ARE AT HICKLING 
BROAD COME THE SUMMER THERE'LL BE 
HUNDREDS OF THESE SEA BOATS UP AND 
DOWN ALL THE READS YOU CAN SEE IS 
A NATURE RESERVE BEYOND THOSE 
HOMES IS THE NORTH SEA THE ALL 
IMPORTANT SEA DEFENCES IT IS THE 
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THEIR FUTURE 
WHICH HAS PEOPLE WORRIED THEY ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT THE VALUE OF THEIR 
HOMES BUSINESSES AND WORRIED ABOUT 
THIS BEAUTIFUL HABITAT BOATS AND 
BROADS HAVE BEEN INTERTWINED FOR 
CENTURIES ALL PART OF A WATER 
WHICH IS LOOKING UNSETTLED THE 
TOURIST INDUSTRY FLOATS ABOUT IT A 
DELICATE ECO SYSTEM AND HOMES SIT 
BESIDES IT BUT NOW ALL COULD BE 
LOST BENEATH IT 
BY SAYING YOU WILL 
DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN FIFTY Y. O. I. R. S. 
YOU HAVE TAKEN ONE THOUSAND PROPERTY WHICH 
WERE FREEHOLD AND MADE THEM 
LEASEHOLD THIS HAS A SIGNIFICANT 
EFFECT ON THEIR MARKET VALUE ALL ALL THE CONTROVERSY IS OVER THESE SEA 
DEFENCES THEY WILL BE MAINTAINED 
OH TER NEXT FIFTY YEARS THSMS PART OF 
THE WORLD WILL LOWER BY TEN SENTI 
METDERS SEA LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO 
RISE BY ONE METRE ONE SCENARIO 
SAYS LET THIS GO SURREND SURRENDER 
ALL THAT LAND TO THE SEA 
WE CANNOT 
GO ON DEFENDING AREAS FOR EVER BIG 
SEA DEFENCES WILL NOT PROTECT THE 
BROADS THEY WILL CHANGE WE HAVE 
TO MANAGE THAT WE HAVE TO BE AWARE 
OF WHAT THOSE CHANGES ARE AND 
MANAGE THAT AND LOOK AT HOW BEST 
TO ADAPT 
IF HOMES AND BUSINESSS 
ARE UNDER WATER HOW CAN THEY ADAPT 
TO THAT LY 
NOT ANSWER THAT THEY THEY HAVE SEEN THE DAMAGE FLOODING CAN 
DO HERE BEFORE IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT THE SEA 
RETREATED BUT IF IT RETURNED FOR 
GOOD SIX VILLAIPLGS HUNDREDS OF 
HOMES AND NORFOLK'S BIGGEST BROAD 
WOULD BE LOST UNDER WAUSH WATER 
WHAT HAPPENS FOR COMPENSATING FRESH 
WATER HABITAT THAT HAS TO BE 
RECREATED THAT IS NOT EASY THE 
WHOLE THINGS NEEDS A COMPLEX LOOK 
AT ONE FINDS THE COSTS MIGHT NOT 
BE TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE COSTS OF 
DEFENDING THE EXISTING LINE FOR AS 
LONG AS POSSIBLE 
THE FUTURE HERE 
LOOKS TO BE A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN 
CLIMATE CHANGE AND COST WELL 
NATURAL ENGLAND SAY THERE ARE FOUR 
OPTIONS FOR THIS AREA THE FIRST 
ONE DO NOTHING THE SECOND HOLD 
THE LINE MAINTAIN THE SEA DEFENCES 
OVER THERE THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE 
HERE WANT THEY SAY THEY DO IN 
HOLLAND WHY NOT HERE THE THIRD IS 
LET A BIT OF THE LAND GO THE 
FOURTH ONE IS MOVE THE DEFENCES 
INLAND THAT WAY AND SURRENDER ALL 
THIS AREA WHY IS THAT PART OF THE 
BROADS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS

EVIDENCE OF HOW WELL THEY'RE CARED 
FOR SHE'S NOT ALLOWED TO EAT THAT 
IT'S THOSE KIND OF CONCERNS WHICH 
HAVE LOAD TO AN INCREASE IN SALES 
OF SO CALLED NANNY CAM TECHNOLOGY 
CAMERAS TO USE IN THE HOME WITH US 
ARE DAMION QUEVA FROM FATHERS 
QUARTERLY MAGAZINE AND MORAG 
CUDDEFORD JONES WELCOME TO YOU 
BOTH APPARENTLY SALES INCREASING 
BY FIFTY PER CENT HUNDREDS BEING SOLD WE'RE 
TOLD ON EBAY WOULD YOU DO IT NO NO I HAVE A CHILD MINDER WHOM I TRUST 
INPLACE ITALY THERE'S NO WAY I 
MEAN HOW DO YOU START A 
RELATIONSHIP YOU'RE HAVING A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR CHILD CARER 
THEY'RE LOOKING AFTER THE MOST 
PRECIOUS THING IN YOUR LIFE YOU 
NODE A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH 
THEM HANDING OVER A CHILD AND 
ASSUMING THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT 
BECAUSE YOU CAN WATCH THEM FROM 
AFAR YOU'RE ABDICATING ALL 
RESPONSIBILITY YOU NEED TO DO 
RESEARCH INTO WHO IS LOOKING AFTER 
YOUR CHILDREN AND BE SAFE IN THE 
NORTH THAT YOU TRUST THAT PERSON 
DAMIEN YOU DON'T USE ONE BUT 
YOU'D THINK ABOUT IT 
I DEFINITELY 
WO I DON'T BELIEVE IN SPY CAMERAS 
I DO BELIEVE IF YOU CAN LET THE 
NANNY KNOW I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH 
PARENTS CHECK ANYTHING ON THEIR 
CHILDREN VIA CAMERA 
IT'S ALL RIGHT 
AS LONG AS YOU TELL THEM THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT 
YOU SAY O. K. WE'RE HIRING YOU RIGHT WE DON'T REALLY TRUST YOU 
ABSOLUTELY YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE 
WITH YOUR CHILDREN ESPECIALLY WITH 
A BABY THEY CAN'T TELL YOU IF 
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG IF IT WAS 
TO SAVE MY CHILD A SERIOUS INJURY 
NOT JUST NANNY BUT BULLYING OR 
OTHER CHILDREN THAT MAY DAMAGE YOUR 
CHILDREN AND ANY PARENT OUT THERE 
WITH CONCERN I DON'T PERSONALLY 
HAVE PROBLEM THE TECHNOLOGY IS 
THERE USE IT 
HERE'S THE 
TECHNOLOGY WE WILL SHOW SOME OF 
THE NANNY CAMS HERE WITH THIS FOR 
EXAMPLE JUST IN THERE YOU HAVE A 
TINY CAMERA IN THERE L. DON'T KNOW 
WHERE THEY ARE IN THE OTHERS ONES 
IF YOU'RE SAYING I HAVE A CAMERA 
AND IT'S THERE THEN IF THEY ARE UP 
TO NO GOOD THEY WON'T DO IT IN 
FRONT OF THAT 
IT'S LIKE BIG 
BROTHER YOU FORGET A CAMERA'S 
THERE IF YOU TELL THEM THAT WE 
HAVE A CAMERA AND TWO THREE MONTHS 
DOWN THE ROAD THEY GET ON WITH IT 
ANY WAY 
IT'S O. K. SO LONG AS YOU 
TELL THEM FIRST 
IT'S O. K. IF YOU 
TELL THEM FIRST I SUPPOSE IF YOU 
ARE REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT LEAVING 
YOUR CHILD FOR THE FIRST TIME AND 
HAVING THIS TRUST AND SAYING I'M 
HAVING TROUBLE WEANING MYSELF OFF 
MY CHILD L. REALLY WANT TO LOOK IN 
ON THEM WHILE I'M AT WORK FOR THE 
FIRST WEEK L. CAN UNDERSTAND HOW 
THAT MIGHT HAPPEN WE HAVE TO TRUST 
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING AFTER 
OUR CHILDREN ALSO WE HAVE TO TRUST 
OURSELVES WE'VE LOOKED AFTER OUR 
CHILDREN WE'VE MADE THE RIGHT 
CHOICE WHEN I WAS LOOKING INTO 
EMPLOYING MY CHILD MINDER I 
CHECKED THROUGH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY 
I FOUND OUT WHO SHE HAD LOOKED 
AFTER BEFORE SHE WAS WELL THOUGHT 
OF SHE'S EXCELLENT L. HAVE NO 
PROBLEMS LEAVING MY CHILD ALL DAY 
WITH HER TO BE SO NERVOUS ALL THE 
TIME THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE YOUR 
CHILD ALONE FOR A MINUTE L. WORK FORTY 
MILES AWAY FROM MY HOME IF I WERE 
TO WATCH MY CHILD BEING SLAPPED OR 
HIT OR SPOKEN TO VERY BRUSQUELY ETC 
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT L. KBT BE 
THERE AT THE TIME 
NEEDLESS TO SAY 
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING LATER ON 
THERE ARE A LOT OF NURSERIES THAT 
NOW HAVE A CAMERA TO CHECK ONLINE 
TO SEE HOW YOUR CHILDREN ARE 
PROGRESSING 
YOU CAN'T MONITOR PROGRESSING EIGHT TO TEN HOURS 
YOU DON'T WANT 
TO NECESSARILY SOME PARENTS WANT 
TO CHECK EVERY NOW AND AGAIN 
PARENTS WANT TO MAKE SURE THEIR 
CHILDREN ARE BEING LOOKED AFTER THE 
WAY THEY WANT THEM TO BE IT'S NO 
GOOD DISCOVERING FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS LATE 
THRER WAS SOMETHING UNTORD GOING ON 
THIS IS NOT JUST TARGETED AT 
NANNIES IT COULD BE TARGETED AT 
OTHER CHILDREN SIBLINGS A FAMILY 
MEMBER THERE ARE OPPORTUNISTIC 
MOMENTS FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF YOUR CHILDREN 
A TEXT 
ISN'T NANNY CAM A WAY TO CASH IN 
ON COLLECTIVE PARANOIDA ANOTHER 
ONE HERE'S A THOUGHT WHY DON'T 
THE PARANOID PARENTS INSTALLING 
NANNY CAMS LOOK AFTER THE CHILDREN 
THEMSELVES 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO THEMSELVES WATCH THEM TEN HOURS A DAY YOU 
MIGHT AS WELL BE THERE TO WATCH 
THEM 
THERE ARE A LOT OF PARENTS THEM WHO FEEL LIKE THAT THEY DO STAY AT 
HOME THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE THAT THE 
PEOPLE CARING FOR YOUR CHILD AREN'T 
GOING TO TREAT THEM THE WAY YOU 
WANT TO 
IF YOU CHECK THE 
REFERENCES DO THE RESEARCH AND 
MAKE SURE YOU ABSOLUTELY TRUST 
WHAT ON EARTH DID WE DO IN THE DAYS 
BEFORE THESE CAMERAS CAME IN 
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S THE POINT IF 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE INDUSTRY 
THIS IS THE MAJORITY IF NOT ALL OF 
NANNIES WONDERFUL IF YOU CHECK 
OUT REFERENCES AND CHECK WITH THE 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THERE ISN'T 
REALLY A NATIONAL BODY THAT YOU CAN 
GO THROUGH ONLY THROUGH YOUR LOCAL 
AUTHORITY THERE ARE OFSTED HAVE A 
CHILD MINDING THING THAT YOU CAN 
REGISTER WITH 
CHILD MINDERS HAVE 
TO GO THROUGH STRINGENT TESTS IN 
ORDER TO GET ON THE LIST 
IT'S FOR 
THOSE ONE OR TWO INSTANCES THAT 
HAPPEN 
HERE'S ONE VIEWER IF CHILD HAPPEN CARERS HAD NOTHING TO HIDE A CAMERA 
MAKES NO DIFFERENT IT'S NOT YOUR 
AVERAGE WORK PLACE WHERE YOU CAN BE 
MONITORED 
I DON'T THINK IT'S MONITORED RIGHT TO INSIST THAT YOU'RE 
WATCHING SOMEONE TWELVE HOURS A DAY OR 
HOWEVER LONG THEY'RE THERE 
YOU ARE SAYING IT IS PART OF LIFE 
SHOPPING MALLS EVERY WHERE WE GO 
WE ARE CONSTANTLY WATCHED ANY WAY 
THE CAMERA IN THIS ONE IS IN THE 
TUMMY WHEN IT IS TURNED ON IT 
WOULD GLOW IS IT THIS ONE HERE IS 
IN THE MOUTH IF YOU IMAGINE 
NANNIES PEERING AT EVERY LAST TOY 
ON THE MANTELPIECE IS THIS THE 
BUN IT IS SO SMALL WHO IS THE 
RANGE OF IT YOU WOULD NOT GET A 
WHOLE ROOM YOU GET A TINY 
SNAPSHOT 
THESE DAYS THEY CAN BE IN SNAPSHOT DIFFERENT COLOURS THEY ARE VERY 
SOPHISTICATED SOPHISTICATED THANK YOU LET US KNOW YOUR THOUGHT 
IT SAYS PAL ON THE BACK WHICH IS 
ANOTHER THING YOU HAVE TO LOCATE 
THIS IS BREAKFAST THERE IS HOPE 
FOR MILLIONS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR 
SITE AS DOCTORS REVERSE ONE FORM OF 
BLINDNESS AUSTRIAN POLICE ARE 
INVESTIGATING A MAN WHO ALERGEEDLY 
HELD HIS DAUGHTER CAPTIVE FOR TWENTY SEVEN

IS WHITBREAD IT OWNS COSTA AND 
OTHERS LIKE THE HOTEL CHAIN 
PREEMYEER INN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
IS ALAN PARKER YOU ARE INTERESTING 
TO TALK TO AT THIS MOMENT BECAUSE 
THERE ARE THREE BIG THINGS GOING ON 
IN THE ECONOMY ALL ASKING YOU THE 
FIRST 
IS RISING FOOD PRICES THAT THAT IS A CHALLENGE WE HAVE AN EIGHT PER CENT THAT COST 
INCREASE IN FOOD NOW T. STEPS WE 
HAVE TAKEN ARE IN PRODUCING 
DISCOUNTS CONTROLLING LABOUR 
BETTER AND CONTROLLING OVERHEADS 
IT IS A CHALLENGE WE RECOGNISE 
THAT 
IF THE COST OF YOUR MILK IS THAT GOING UP IN COSTA THAT PUTS AN 
INCREASE ON THE AMOUNT TO KEEP THE 
BUSINESS GOING ARE YOU PASSING IT 
ON TO CONSUMERS WITH HIGHER BILLS 
OR SOME SPLIT 
WHAT WE WANT TO DO 
IS JUST OPERATE OUR BUSINESSES MORE 
EFFICIENTLY AND KEEP OUR PRICES THE 
SAME AS WE ARE AT THE MOMENT WE 
ARE TAKING COSTS OUT OF THE 
BUSINESS IN OTHER AREAS 
OFF THE 
TOP OF YOUR HEAD HOW MUCH HAS YOUR 
FOOD BILL RISEN THIS YEAR 
IT WILL 
BE GOING UP EIGHT PER CENT WHICH IS WELL OVER 
ONE HUNDRED MILLION 
THE OTHER THING IS 
THE GENERAL SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY 
WHEN THAT HAPPENS PEOPLE WATCH THE 
PENNYS THEY PROBABLY SPEND LESS 
EATING OUT IN RESTAURANTS THAT IS 
THE OTHER BIG THING ARE YOU 
EXPECTING A TOUGH YEAR OUR OUR RESTAURANTS BENEFIT FROM BEING NEXT 
DOOR TO PREMIER INNS WE HAVE A 
SEMI CAPTIVE MARKET WITH OUR 
PREMIER INN GUESTS FIFTY PER CENT EAT IN OUR 
RESTAURANTS WE FELL RESILIENT IN 
OUR RESTAURANT BUSINESS YOU YOU MENTION HOTELS THERE WAS A TALK OF 
A MERGER WITH TRAVEL LODGE

A DISCUSSION WITH THE DUB BAY

AGO STEPHEN HUMMUS COULD HARDLY 
SEE IN THE DARK THANKS TO A 
PIONEERING OPERATION HIS SITE HAS

THIS IS WHAT HE WAS LIKE SHOREY 
AFTER HIS OPERATION HE KEEPS 
BUMPING INTO THE WALLS SHORTLY 
IT TAKES HIM ONE MINUTE AND SEVENTEEN 
SECONDS TO GET TO THE END LOOK AT 
THE TRANSFORMATION STRAIGHT 
THROUGH IN FOURTEEN SECONDS 
I CAN DO 
MORE THAN WHAT I USED TO AT NIGHT 
I HAVE GOT MORE SELF CONFIDENCE 
STEPHEN'S EYESIGHT WAS FAILING 
BECAUSE OF FAULTY GENE SURGEONS 
INJECTED GOOD COPIES OF THE GENE

IMPROVED STEPHEN'S SIDE FOLLOWING 
THEIR SUCCESS THE RESEARCHERS HOPE 
TO TRY OUT THEIR GENE THERAPY ON

TOPPED UP AGAIN WE HAVE SEEN THAT 
TWO TANKERS HAVE ARRIVED IN

AREAS LIKE THIS IN THE SCOTTISH 
BORDERS PEOPLE ARE TAKING HEED OF 
THE WARNING NOT TO FILL UP TO MATCH 
AT THIS PARTICULAR STATION THEY 
ARE BEING LIMITED TO IT ONLY BUYING 
TWENTY OFF YOUR AT A TIME TOO MUCH 
FOR AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE CAREFUL

BELIEVE THAT AS SUPPLIES FINISH AND 
SUPPLIES ARE COMING IN FROM SEE 
ANDY'S REACH THE PETROL STATIONS IN 
SCOTLAND THINGS CAN RETURN TO 
NORMAL AND THESE LEAVING YOUR 
CHILDREN WITH A NEW NANNY CAN BE 
WORRYING MANY PARENTS HAVE DECIDED 
NOT TO LEAVE ANYTHING TO CHANCE IF 
SALES OF HIDDEN CAMERAS ARE ON THE 
INCREASE EBAY SAY THEY ARE SELLING 
HUNDREDS EVERY MONTH SALES OF THE 
CAMERAS HAVE GONE UP BY FIFTY PER CENT OVER 
THE LAST YEAR RETURNING TO WORK 
AND LEAVING YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE 
CARE OF OTHERS CAN BE AN ANXIOUS 
TIME THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY MEANS 
PARENTS CAN KEEP AN EYE ON THEIR 
CHILDREN FROM A DISTANCE AT THIS 
NURSERY IN NORTH LONDON THEY HAVE 
INSTALLED VIDEO CAMERAS WHICH 
CONSTANTLY RECALL WHAT IS GOING ON 
AT HOME OR WORK PARENTS CAN LOG ON 
TO A SECURE WEBSITE AND SEE HOW 
WELL THEIR CHILDREN ARE BEING 
TREATED 
I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE TREATED HOW HE DIGESTED IN HIS NEW 
ENVIRONMENT IT WAS WONDERFUL TO 
SEE THAT HE WAS O. K. BUT JUST DID 
SOME PARENTS HAVE BEGUN TAKING US 
TO HALT NEW LEVEL SO CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING 
AFTER THEIR CHILDREN THEY ARE 
INSTALLING HIDDEN CAMERAS IN THEIR 
HOME 
THE IF YOUR CHILD IS NOT YET HOME AT SCHOOL AND YOU HAVE EMPLOYED 
SOMEONE TO LOOK AFTER YOUR CHILD AT 
HOME AND THAT CHILD BECOMES LESS 
HAPPY THE BEHAVIOUR CHANGES I DO 
NOT THINK THAT IS A PERSON WANTING 
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSON 
LOOKING AFTER THEIR CHILD CAN BE 
TRUSTED 
THE TREND FOR INSTALLING TRUSTED NANNY CAMS BEGAN IN THE U. S. THESE 
MUCH PUBLICISED IMAGES APPEARED TO 
SHOW A NANNY NEGLECTING A BABY SHE 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AFTER 
TECHNOLOGY SEEMS TO BE BECOMING 
MORE POPULAR HERE THE IMAGES CAN 
BE RECORDED FOR PARENTS TO WATCH 
WHEN THEY GET HOME OR THEY CAN BE 
VIEWED LIVE ON A COMPUTER OR 
MONITOR LEGALLY WE ARE ALLOWED TO 
HAVE HIDDEN CAMERAS IN OUR HOMES 
WHAT THEY RECORD CAN BE USED TO 
PROSECUTE BAD CARERS THOSE WHO 
REPRESENT NANNIES SAY THEY ARE 
CONCERNED 
YOU SELECT A FULLY CONCERNED TRAINED NANNY AND YOU SHOULD NOT BE 
CONCERNED YOU SHOULD NOT NEED TO 
SPY ON PEOPLE WHILE THEY ARE 
WORKING WHEN SURE SOME OF THESE 
PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE HAPPY BEING 
SPIED ON WHEN THEY DID THEIR WORK 
THE CAMERAS DO NOT PROTECT CHILDREN 
DESPITE THIS MANY PARENTS SEEM 
KEEN TO EMBRACE ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY 
THAT THEY FEEL GIVES THEM PEACE OF 
MIND FOLK OF THE VOTING SYSTEM 
IS SUBJECT TO LARGE SCALE FRAUD 
MEASURES SUCH AS POST OP AND 
ELECTRONIC VOTING ARE INCREASING 
RISKS THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT HAS 
TAKEN STEPS TO STOP FRAUD THE BIG 
SUPERMARKETS SO THEY ARE HAPPY TO 
HELP OVER THE FACT THAT STORES HAVE 
BEEN ALLEGEDLY SWAPPING INFORMATION 
OVER PRICES FOR HEALTH AND BEAUTY 
PRODUCTS AND GROCERIES THE THE SUPERMARKETS COMPETE JUST BECAUSE 
THEY ARE COMPETITIVE IT DOES NOT 
MEAN THEY CANNOT BE MORE 
COMPETITIVE JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE 
COMPETING IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT 
PRICES ARE AS LOW AS THEY MIGHT BE 
YOU SPENT MONTHS WAITING AND THEN 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND COME ALONG AT ONE TIME THE 
TURTLES ARRIVED ON BEACH IN 
EASTERN INDIA DESPITE EFFORTS TO 
HAVE LITTLE ONES ONLY ONE IN EVERY 
ONE THOUSAND NORMALLY REACHES ADULTHOOD 
FROM ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BABY TURTLES ONLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
MAKE IT APPARENTLY THAT IS BETTER 
THAN THEY USED TO BE THEY USED TO 
GET SUFFOCATED BY THE SOUND SAND 
IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS JOANNA 
LUMLEY WILL BE HERE TO TELL US 
ABOUT THE WINNERS AND LOSERS AT THE 
GOOD EGG AWARDS FIRST OUR MAIN 
STORY IS THAT DOCTORS HERE RESTORED 
SIGHT TO REPLIED SEVENTEEN NOT WANT TO 
EXTEND TRIALS OF THEIR TECHNIQUE TO 
COVER OTHER HEREDITARY EYE 
CONDITIONS SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD IT 
INVOLVES INJECTING HEALTHY GENES 
INTO THE BACK WHEN I BALL OUR 
SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT SPOKE TO 
STEPHEN HOWARTH EYEBALL 
I PLAY 
GUITAR IT HAS MADE THINGS A BIT 
CLEARER WE DO PEEKS AT COLLEGE 
OCCASIONING INSTEAD OF STANDING 
STILL IN ONE PLACE I TEND TO MOVE 
AROUND MORE WHAT I WANT TO DO ONE 
THING I AM LEARNING FOUR IS TO GET 
THE JOB IN THE MUSIC STUDIO 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT EVENT 
EVENTUALLY MOVE OUT AND GET MY OWN 
PLACE THEN 
THE MUST HAVE GIVING 
YOU A BOOST IN YOUR CONFIDENCE IT IT IS GOOD L. USED TO BE SHY AND 
SILENT I HAVE GOT CONFIDENCE TO 
WALK AROUND ON MY OWN PROFESSOR PROFESSOR JOHN MARSHALL IS A LEADING EYE 
SPECIALIST GOOD MORNING THIS IS A 
REALLY IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH THIS THIS IS THE FIRST SCIENTIFIC KEEP 
PROVING TREATMENT FOR INHERITED EYE 
DISEASES IT REPRESENTS A MAJOR 
BREAK FREE HOW 
DO S. 
IT WORK 
BREAK FREE BREAKTHROUGH 
TWO THE GROUP HAS BREAKTHROUGH DEVELOPED TWO THINGS THEY HAVE 
DEVELOPED GENES WHICH THEY HAVE PUT 
INTO A VIRUS TAKING THE OWN 
VIRUS'S D. N. A. WAFERS OF A HAVE 
DEVELOPED SURGICAL TECHNIQUES TO 
INTRODUCE THESE INTO THE BACK OF 
THE EYE BEHIND THE RETINA IN 
ORDER TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE 
GENES THAT WERE PRESENT IN THE 
INDIVIDUAL'S EYES AS A CONSEQUENCE 
THE INDIVIDUALS CAN SEE 
YOU HEAR 
THIS AND YOU THINK THIS IS VERY 
GOOD NEWS FOR YOU AND YOUR 
CHILDREN YOU HAVE GOT A GENETIC 
CONDITION WHICH CAUSES BLINDNESS 
WE HAVE A DOMINANT GENE IN OUR 
FAMILY WHICH MEANS IT IS PASSED 
DOWN TO EVERY GENERATION MY 
CHILDREN STAND A FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. CHANCE OF 
GETTING THE CONDITION MY BIGGEST 
MOTIVATION OF IN TERMS OF GETTING 
INVOLVED IN THE CHARITY AND FUND 
RAISING IS FOR THAN THEM DO 
NOT WANT THEM TO GO THROUGH THE 
SAME AS THE REST OF MY FAMILY HAVE 
BEEN THROUGH HOW 
IT AFFECT 
BEEN THROUGH YOUR WORK YOU ARE AN ARTIST THESE 
ARE RECENT PAINTINGS 
THEY ARE 
QUITE RECENT AT THE MOMENT I CAN 
STILL PAINT THE CONDITIONS UNDER 
WHICH I PAINT IS THE CRITICAL BIT 
REALLY I CANNOT SEE IN LOW LIGHT 
AND I CANNOT SEE IN BRIGHT LIGHT 
IF THE LIGHT IS NOT EXACTLY RIGHT 
THEN I CANNOT WORK THAT GETS 
INCREASINGLY HARDER AND HARDER AS 
THE YEARS GOODBYE 
HOW LONG COULD 
IT BE BEFORE PEOPLE LIKE SOPHIE 
FEEL THE BENEFITS 
I SHOULD 
EMPHASISE THE NEXT STAGE OF THIS 
PARTICULAR TREATMENT IS TO TREAT 
YOUNG CHILDREN THE DISEASE THAT 
THE GROUP TREATED RESULTS IN BLIND 
NESS BY THE THIRD DECADE OF LIFE 
APPLY TO US THE NEXT STAGE IS TO 
TREAT YOUNG CHILDREN WE NEED TO 
ADDRESS OTHER DISEASES WITHIN THE 
GROUP OF INHERITED DISEASES WE 
SHOULD LOOK TO THE YOUNG CHILDREN 
BEING TREATED 
BY THE END OF THIS 
YEAR 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE YEAR TRIAL WOULD EXTEND TO YOUNGER 
CHILDREN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
YEARS WE WILL SEE AN EVER 
INCREASING EXPANSION IN GENE 
THERAPY OF THIS SORT 
YOU COULD TREAT SOPHIE'S CHILDREN 
AND STOP THEM DEVELOPING THE 
DISEASE 
SOPHIE HAS A PARTICULAR DISEASE PROBLEM IN HER CASE IT'S THE 
DOMINANT GENE SHE HAS ONE GOOD 
GENE AND A BAD GENE THAT'S A 
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CASE IN WHICH 
WE HAVE TO KILL THE EFFECT OF THE 
BAD GENE BUT THERE'S A GROUP 
WORKING ON THAT PROBLEM 
HOW MUCH 
LONGER DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE 
TO PRODUCE WORK LIKE THIS 
I DON'T 
KNOW FUNNILY ENOUGH PRIESTSLY I 
TOOK RATHER A LEISURELY APPROACH TO 
PAINTING PREVIOUSLY NOW THERE'S 
A SENSE OF URGENCY L. DON'T KNOW 
WHAT THE TIMESCALE IS IT IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE L. DO 
FEEL I DO FEEL UNDER PRESSURE TO 
PRODUCE 
GET AS MUCH WORK DONE AS PRODUCE YOU CAN YES WONDERED JOHN A YES LOT OF PERSON LISTENING WOULD HAVE 
AGE RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION 
IS IS THIS SOMETHING THAT COULD A 
PLY TO THAT 
AGE RELATED MACULAR 
DEGENETIC DEGENERATION IS 
RELATED TO AGE WE KNOW THERE ARE 
RISKS IF YOU ARE A SMOKER THERE'S 
A RISK THE FACT THAT THIS TRIAL 
HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL WILL CERTAINLY 
HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR AGE RELATED 
MACULAR DEGENERATION 
STILL TO COME SURRENDERED TO THE

THE TROUBLE IS THIS PART OF THE 
WORLD OVER THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED YEARS WILL 
LOWER BY TEN CENTIMETRES AND SEA 
LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO RISE BY A 
METRE ONE SCENARIO SAYS LET THAT 
GO AND SURRENDER THAT LAND TO THE 
SEA 
WE CAN'T GO ON DEFENDING AREAS SEA FOREVER BIG SEA DEFENCES WON'T 
PROTECT THE BRAUDS FROM SALINE 
INTRUSION WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW 
TO BEST TO THE CHANGES 
IF HOMES 
AND BUSINESSES ARE UNDER WATER HOW 
CAN YOU ADAPT 
I'LL NOT ANSWER THAT 
IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT THE SEA RETREATED F. IT 
RETURNED FOR GOOD SIX VILLAGES

THEY WANT KIDS BETWEEN ELEVEN TO THIRTEEN TO 
COME UP WITH LOCAL ECOLOGICAL 
CAMPAIGNS GREEN CAMPAIGNS IN THEIR 
LOCAL AREA TO PROMOTE MARKET AND 
GET IN THE MEDIA AND MAKE EVERYONE 
A LITTLE MORE AWARE ABOUT THE 
ENVIRONMENT AND STUFF I'M INVOLVED 
WITH MY OTHER HEAD IS EDITORIAL 
DIRECTOR OF KIDS NEWS WE HAVE BEEN 
STRUCK BY HOW MANY KIDS ARE IN TUNE 
WITH THE ENVIRONMENT L. TESTED ONE 
OF MY SONS YESTERDAY WHO IS TEN 
HE SAID THEY HAVE A KID IN THEIR 
CLASS WHO IS THE GREEN UNICORN THE 
POINT MAN FOR ENVIRONMENT STUFF 
PEOPLE GO TO HIM FOR INFORMATION 
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH I 
THOUGHT WAS STRIKING CERTAINLY 
LEFT ME FAR BEHIND SO I HOPE THAT 
WE CAN EDUCATE KIDS THAT THEY GET 
ENERGISED BY THIS COMPETITION I'M 
JUDGING IT TO SEE WHICH SCHOOL 
PRODUCES WE THINK THE BEST LOCAL 
IDEA I CONGRATULATE EMPIRE IT IS 
A GOOD CAMPAIGN 
IT'S GOING TO BE 
THEIR WORLD THEY WILL HAVE TO LIVE 
WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE MESS 
THAT PREVIOUS GENERATIONS HAVE MADE 
I'M FATHER OF THREE I AM

OF THIS STUFF IS AT BEST HAS BEEN 
MINIMAL THEIRS IS MUCH KEENER 
MORE SHORP KIDS ARE ENERGISED ON 
THIS IT'S ALL ABOUT PEOPLE SAID 
TO ME HOW GREEN ARE YOU THE 
REALITY IS I GO TO AMERICA LOT 
MY CARBON FOOTPRINT IS PRETTY 
APPALLING I'VE STARTED BECAUSE OF

LOCAL FLOOD AGO CROSS PARTS OF 
YORKSHIRE MOVE UP ACROSS SCOTLAND 
AND CURRENTLY WE HAVE SEVERE 
WEATHER WARNING FOR PARTS OF

OF ENGLAND THROUGH THE COURSE OF 
TOMORROW YOU'LL NOTICE THE CLOUD 
SPREADS OVER SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND

LATE FOR THE REST OF THE BRITISH 
ISLES IT'S SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS 
AND VARIABLE AMOUNTS OF CLOUD BUT 
A BRIGHTER DAY FOR THE NORTH EAST 
OF SCOTLAND TOMORROW COMPARED TO 
WHAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY 
WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR BREAKFAST 
HOW DOES THIS LOOK MARMITE AND ICE 
CREAM OR WHAT ABOUT FRYED EGGS 
WITH M. M. M. JUST A LITTLE DAB OF 
MINT SAUCE THEY ARE ONE OF THE 
WEIRD AND WONDERFUL THINGS THAT 
PREGNANT MUMS HAVE GOT CRAVINGS FOR 
ALONG WITH COOL TOOTHPASTE AND 
MINT AND MORTAR FOOD CRAVINGS IN 
PREGNANCY ARE MORE COMMON THREE 
QUARTERS EXPERIENCE THEM COMPARED 
TO THREE IN TEN FIFTY YEARS AGO WHY 
ARE OUR TASTE BUDS SO HAYWIRE WE 
HAVE THREE MUMS 
AND OF COURSE SIAN L. WILL SIT BACK 
RELAX AND LET YOU ALL TALK ABOUT IT 
IF I MAY START WITH YOU WHY HAVE 
THE NUMBERS GONE UP 
I DON'T THINK 
THEY HAVE WE HAVE RUNG OLDER 
RELATIVES ALL OUR OLDER RELATIVES 
HAD CRAVINGS WE DID NOT HAVE THE 
INTERNET TO COLLECT THE DATA GO 
BACK A FEW GENERATIONS WE WERE NOT 
IN THE LAND OF PLENTY AS WE ARE NOW 
MY MOTHER HAD CRAVINGS BUT SHE 
COULD NOT INDULGE IN THEM SHE HAD 
HAD RATIONING GOING ON IT HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN WOMEN WHO HAVE 
PREGNANT HAVE ALWAYS HAD A TASTE IN 
THEIR CHANGE BUDS THEY HAVE SOME 
CRAVINGS SOME MORE BIZARRE THAN 
OTHERS 
ANY FOR YOU 
JELLY BABIES OTHERS THE NEWSAGENT NEXT DOOR TO THE 
SURGERY WOULD ONLY SELL ME ONE DOOR 
A DAY BECAUSE HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT 
THE STATE OF MY TEETH 
ICE SEEMS TO 
BE A TOP ONE ICE 
WE SPOKE ABOUT ICE THIS EARLIER ICE COOL BRICK DUST 
COAL BRICK DUST 
I HAD ALWAYS HEARD IT WAS PERHAPS A 
SIGN OF IRON DEFICIENCY A LOT OF 
MUMS ON NETMUMS SAID ONE CRAVED 
COAL AND BRICK DUST SHE IS FUNNY 
SHE WOULD GET A KICK OUT OF 
WATCHING DIY PROGRAMMES 
WHEN I WAS 
PREGNANT WITH OUR SECOND CHILD WE 
HAD OUR RENDER REDONE I WOULD CHIP 
IT OFF AND EAT IT 
A LOT OF WOMEN 
WHO ARE PREGNANT FIND IT VERY 
DIFFICULT TO EAT ANYTHING BECAUSE 
YOU FEEL SEASICK ALL THE TIME MANY 
MEN WATCHING WILL WONDER IT IS 
LIKE FEELING SEASICK OR CAR SICK 
ICE COLD FIZZY DRINKS ARE VERY GOOD 
GING GERRY THINGS ARE GOOD THE 
SENSE OF SMELL IT IS RELATED L. 
COULD SMELL MARMITE FOUR MILES AWAY 
ONLY WHEN PREGNANT COULD NOT SMELL 
IT AS SOON WITHOUT FEELING SICK 
WHERE IS THE SCIENCE 
PEOPLE HAVE 
LOOKED TO SEE WHY WOMEN CRAVE 
PARTICULAR FOODS THE ANSWER IS 
THERE ISN'T IF YOU ARE CRAVING 
THINGS TO EAT WITH METAL IN IT 
DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE AN IRON 
DEFICIENCY YOU GO FOR FOODS YOU 
DIDN'T GO FOR THAL YOU DIDN'T 
BEFORE IT IS ALL TO DO WITH 
HORMONES THE REASON YOU GO FOR 
COAL OR MORTAR NO ONE KNOWS 
MARMITE I CAN UNDERSTAND ANY YEAST 
EXTRACT HAS VITAMIN B. IN 
IF YOU 
ARE FEELING SICK VITAMIN B. IS GOOD 
FOR HELPING THAT 
THERE IS NO 
SCIENCE IN IT PEOPLE ARE NOT 
DEFICIENT IN WHAT THEY CRAVE FOR FOR INSTANCE THE MUM WHO CRAVED COAL 
SAID SHE WAS PRESCRIBED IRON TAB 
LETS AND HER CRAVING STOPPED L. 
WOULD NEVER ARGUE WITH A DOCTOR 
HERE IS A MESSAGE FROM VIEWER 
SAYING MY MUM CRAVED MINT SAUCE 
AND CHEESE ON CRACKERS NOW I AM 
ALLERGIC TO CHEESE AND PRODUCTS 
CONTAINING VINEGAR 
IT SHOWS YOU 
THE CHANGE THAT HAPPENS L. KNOW YOU 
LOOK PREGNANT PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
STRAIGHT HAIR GO CURLY STRANGE 
THINGS HAPPEN IT IS AN ENORMOUS 
CHANGE THE WHOLE CRAVING THINGS 
AND SMELLING THINGS DIFFERENTLY IS 
A WAY A REALISING THIS MASSIVE 
CHANGE IS HAPPENING IN YOUR LIFE 
IT MAKES YOU AWARE OF THAT I I WONDER IF YOU EAT A LOT OF ONE 
THING THE BABIES END UP LIKING IT

OF LUCK LAST WEEK WAS 
CONTROVERSIAL ENOUGH WHEN ANDREW 
SAID IT WAS THE HARDEST DECISION HE 
EVER HAD TO MAKE YOU SURVIVED THAT 
ONE THIS WEEK STORMING OFF THE SET 
IT WAS SUCH SHOCK TO ME L. WAS 
NOT EXPECTING THAT AT ALL JUST TO 
HAVE HIS SUPPORT IS AN AMAZING 
THING 
WHY WAS HE SO ANGRY HE KEPT THING SAYING I AM VERY ANGRY WITH THIS 
DECISION THEN HE WALKS OFF WHAT 
MADE HIM SO CROSS 
I THINK HE WAS 
CROSS THAT THE FACT THAT NIAMH AND 
I HAD BEEN IN THE BOTTOM TWO HE 
COULDN'T BELIEVE IT HE WAS ANGRY 
WITH THE NATION FOR VOTING US INTO 
THE BOTTOM TWO IF THEY DID NOT 
LIKE OUR PERFORMANCES 
DID HE SPEAK 
TO YOU AFTERWARDS

CHANCE TO SPEAK TO HIM NO L. DIDN'T 
HE DID SAY I WOULD DO DIDN'T ANYTHING TO HELP YOU IN THE FUTURE

WILLING TO TAKE TIME OUT TO HELP ME 
IN MY CAREER AM SO GRATEFUL

ILL JUST THE KNOCKS AND IN THAT 
RESPECT I DIDN'T THINK I HAD GIVEN 
MY BEST AT ALL

OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING ELSE 
CASTING AGENCIES AROUND THE 
COUNTRY COUNTRY WHO KNOWS
