ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION SAY PRESIDENT 
MUGABE IS PREPARING FOR WAR AGAINST 
HIS OWN PEOPLE THEY SAY ROBERT 
MUGABE IS PREPARING A MILITARY 
CRACKDOWN TO HOLD ON TO POWER THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH HEADS FOR LONDON AS 
GORDON BROWN DEFENDS HIS DECISION 
TO WELCOME IT TO DOWNING STREET 
AND ON A BIG DAY OF SPORT COMPLY 
OR DIE ROMPS HOME IN THE GRAND 
NATIONAL NATIONAL AND PORTSMOUTH ARE THROUGH TO THE 
F. A. CUP FINAL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
ALMOST SEVENTY YEARS 
HELLO A VERY GOOD EVENING TO 
ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION LEADER HAS 
SAID HE FEARS PRESIDENT ROBERT 
MUGABE IS PREPARING FOR WAR AGAINST 
HIS PEOPLE IN AN ATTEMPT TO CLING 
ON TO POWER SPEAKING AT A NEWS 
CONFERENCE THE M. D. C. LEADER MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI INSISTED HE WAS THE 
CLEAR WINNER OF LAST WEEK'S 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND SAID HE 
WAS PREPARING FOR POWER THE B. B. C. IS 
BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE BUT ORLA 
GUERIN HAS THIS REPORT FROM 
NEIGHBOURING SOUTH AFRICA 
ONE WEEK AFTER THE ELECTIONS AND 
ZIMBABWE IS STILL WAITING AND STILL 
WONDER WE AREING WHAT COMES NEXT 
THE STREETS ARE CALM BUT NOT FOR 
LONG SAYS THE OPPOSITION IT 
CLAIMS THE RULING PARTY IS GETTING 
READY FOR BATTLE 
ZANU P. F. IS 
PREPARING A WAR ON THE PEOPLE SUCH 
AS WE HAVE WITNESSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND 
TWO THOUSAND TWO AFRICAN LEADERS SURELY MUST 
NOW SAY NO TO MUGABE IN THE SAME 
WAY THAT ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE HAVE 
SAID NO TO HIM 
BUT NO SIGN OF 
THAT FROM MUGABE'S NEXT DOOR 
NEIGHBOUR TABY MBEKI LOOKING 
RELAXED ON BRITISH SOIL TODAY 
THE SOUTH AFRICAN LEADER WANTS THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO KEEP ON 
WAITING FOR THE RESULTS GORDON 
BROWN WANTS AN END TO THE DELAYS 
WE'LL SEE WHAT COMES OUT BUT BOTH 
TSVANGIRAI AND MUGABE HAVE SAID IN 
THE EVENT THAT NOBODY HAS THE 
MAJORITY THAT IS NEEDED TO BE 
ELECTED THEY'RE QUITE READY FOR A 
SECOND ROUND 
I THINK THE IMPORTANT 
THING IS THAT THE RESULTS HAVE TO 
BE PUBLISHED THEY CAN NO LONGER BE 
DELAYED AND THE ELECTIONS HAVE TO 
BE SEEN TO BE FAIR AND THAT IS THE 
UNITED VIEW OF EVERYBODY HERE BUT BUT ROBERT MUGABE PROBABLY IS NOT 
LISTENING HE HAS HAD A CAREFULLY 
CHOREOGRAPHED SHOW OF SUPPORT FROM 
HIS PARTY PUBLICLY AT LEAST THE 
RULING PARTY IS BACKING HIM ALL THE 
WAY IN A PRESIDENTIAL ONE OFF 
MANY ZIMBABWEANS FEAR THE WORST IS 
YET TO COME PRESIDENT MUGABE IS 
KEEPING HIS SECURITY FORCES ON THE 
STREETS IN THE PAST HE HAS NOT 
HESITATED TO USE THEM AGAINST THE 
OPPOSITION AND IF THERE IS ANOTHER 
VOTE HE WON'T WANT TO LEAVE MUCH TO 
CHANCE WE CAN TALK TO ORLA NOW 
LIVE IN JOHANNESBURG A REAL 
RATCHETING UP OF THE RHETORIC FROM 
THE 
OPPOSITION TODAY THE THE OPPOSITION ARE TURNING UP THE HEAT 
AND SO IS PRESIDENT MUGABE FIRST 
OF ALL THE OPPOSITION M. D. C. AT THAT 
NEWS CONFERENCE ANNOUNCING ONCE 
AGAIN THAT IT WAS NOT JUST THE 
CLEAR WINNER AT THE ELCTIONCTION 
BUT IT WAS NOW PREPARING AND HAVING 
DISCUSSIONS AND GETTING INTO A 
GOVERNMENT OF HEALING FOR ZIMBABWE 
THAT IS A DIRECT CHALLENGE TO 
PRESIDENT MUGABE WHAT THE M. D. C. IS 
DESPERATELY TRYING TO DO I THINK 
IS TO CREATE SOME FACTS ON THE 
GROUND AND TRY TO KEEP PUSHING ITS 
CLAIM OF VICTORY THEY WENT AGAIN 
TODAY TO COURT THEIR LAWYERS WERE 
BLOCKED BY ARMED POLICE ON THE 
STEPS NOT EVENLY ABLE TO GET IN ON 
THEIR FIRST ATTEMPT THEY GOT IN 
LATER BUT THEY STILL DID NOT GET 
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS 
THAT THE WORLD AND ZIMBABWE HAVE 
BEEN WAITING FORO SEVEN DAYS THE 
FEAR IS THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE IS 
MAKING PREPARATIONS OF HIS OWN 
MOBILISING WAR VETERANS AND 
MILITIAS AND MAKING IT CLEAR HE 
DOES INTEND TO GO OUT FIGHTING 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH IS DUE TO ARRIVE 
IN THE U. K. IN JUST OVER TWO HOURS' 
TIME ON THE LATEST STAGE OF ITS 
RELAY AROUND THE WORLD THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAS DEFEND HIS DECISION TO 
RECEIVE THE TORCH IN DOWNING STREET 
TOMORROW DESPITE CRITICISM OVER 
CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD AND ITS 
CRACKDOWN ON TIBET 
ON ITS WAY TO BRITAIN THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH WAS CARRIED THROUGH SAINT 
PETERSBURG TODAY AMID 
DEMONSTRATION FOR SUPPORTERS OF 
TIBET AGAINST BEIGEAGE CAMPAIGNERS 
WHO SAY THE TORCH IS TAINTED BY 
CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD ARE 
PLANNING PROTESTS ALONG THE ROUTE 
IN LONDON AS WELL GORDON BROWN IS 
UNDER FURTHER PRESSURE NOT TO 
RECEIVE THE FLAME IN DOWNING STREET 
WITH SUGGESTIONS THAT THE FRENCH 
PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY 
BOYCOTTING THE OPENING CEREMONY OF 
THE GAMES BUT THE PRIME MINISTER 
SHOWS KNOW SIGN OF BACKING DOWN 
THE DALAI LAMA HIMSELF SAYS HE DOES 
NOT WANT TO SEE A BOYCOTTING OF THE 
OLYMPICS AND THAT IS WHY AM SAYING 
THAT AS HOST COUNTRY OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
OLYMPICS WE WILL REEV IT AS MANY 
OTHERS WILL DO SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE 
RECEIVE 
GORDON BROWN KNOWS THAT THE 
OLYMPICS TO BE A GOOD PLACE TO PUT 
PRESSURE ON CHINA OVER HUMAN RIGHTS 
BUT CAMPAIGNERS ARE PUTTING HIM 
UNDER PRESSURE OVER RECEIVING THE 
TORCH 
HE SHOULDN'T RECEIVE THE 
TORCH TORCH THE TORCH IS ASSOCIATED WITH 
SPORT AND WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH 
THAT BUT HE IS ASSOCIATING HIMSELF 
WITH A TORCH THAT IS USED AS A 
PROPAGANDA TOOL A 
FEW PEOPLE WHO 
WERE GOING TO CARRY THE TORCH HAVE 
PULLED OUT BUT ONE OLYMPIC 
MEDALLIST EXPLAINED WHY HE WAS 
TAKING PART 
I HAVE A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE 
OLYMPICS FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS IF 
YOU BOYCOTT ON A MASS BASIS ON A 
REGULAR BASIS THEN OF COURSE THE 
OLYMPICS THEMSELVES WILL BE DAMAGED 
ACTIVISTS PROTESTING AT CHINA'S 
SUPPRESSION OF TIBET'S INDEPENDENCE 
MOVEMENT ABSEILED FROM WESTMINSTER 
BRIDGE TO UNFURL A BANNER TODAY 
THEIR FAIL EURO TO PERSUADE THE 
PRIME MINISTER WON'T DETER FURTHER 
PROTESTS TOMORROW THERE HAVE BEEN 
MORE PROBLEMS AT HEATHROW'S 
TERMINAL FIVE DESPITE A PROMISE THAT 
THERE WOULD BE NORMAL SERVICE AT 
THE TERMINAL FOR THE FIRST TIME 
TODAY TWELVE SHORT HAUL DESTINATIONS 
FLIGHTS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED TODAY 
AND THE DAY'S BIG SPORTING NEWS 
THERE WAS TO BE NO FAIRYTALE FOR 
THE MCCAIN FAMILY AT AINTREE ALL 
THE TALK WAS WHETHER DONALD MCCAIN 
COULD FOLLOW IN HIS FATHER'S 
FOOTSTEPS WITH THE SUCCESS WITH RED 
RUM AND GUIDE CLOUDY LANE TO 
SUCCESS AT AINTREE A CLOUDY DAY AT 
AINTREE NEVER DETERS THE FAITHFUL 
OR THE FASHIONABLE AND EVERYBODY 
THOUGHT THAT CLOUDY LANE COULD 
PROVIDE A SILVER LINING CLOUDY CLOUDY LANE DEFINITELY 
CLOUDY LANE IT

FOUR CLUBS NOT SO 
THE 
SEASON OF SURPRISES THE YEAR OF 
THE UNDERDOG WHEN BEING FAVOURITE

PORTSMOUTH FOUND THAT OUT IN THE 
EARLY STAGES AS WEST BROM LAID 
SIEGE TO DAVID JAMES'S GOAL BUT 
WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PREMIER LEAGUE 
AND CHAMPIONSHIP TAKING YOUR 
CHANCES THIS WAS PORTSMOUTH'S 
FIRST OF THE MATCH THERE WAS A 
SUSPICION OF HANDBALL FROM MILAN 
BAROS BUT HIS SHOT WAS SAVED BUT 
THEN IT WENT STRAIGHT TO KANU AND A 
FORMER ALBION PLAYER THEN ALBION 
SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST EQUALLISED 
BUT PORTSMOUTH'S FANS HAVE LONG 
SUSPECTED THAT THEIR NAME IS ON THE 
CUP THIS YEAR AND THEY'VE MADE IT 
THROUGH TO THE FINAL

TO MAKE IT THROUGH TO A FINAL AND 
FULL MARKS TO WEST BROM THEY
