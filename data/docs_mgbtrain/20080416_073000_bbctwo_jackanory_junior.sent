THIS IS JACKANORY JUNIOR 
HELLO I'M LEE 
THIS IS THE STORY OF A MAN WHOSE HOUSE WAS INVADED BY ELVES 
YES THAT'S ONE OF THEM 
THE STORY IS CALLED BOB AND THE HOUSE ELVES 
BOB WAS A BUILDER AND A VERY HAPPY MAN 
HE LIVED IN A LITTLE MESSY HOUSE THAT SUITED HIM JUST FINE 
MOST NIGHTS HE ATE BAKED BEANS OUT OF A TIN AND WATCHED T. V. 
ON SATURDAYS HIS MATES CAME ROUND FOR CARDS AND THEY ORDERED PIZZA 
ONE THURSDAY MORNING BOB WOKE UP AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS AS USUAL 
HE KNEW AT ONCE THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG 
SOMEONE HAD CLEANED HIS KITCHEN 
NOTHING LOOKED THE SAME EVEN THE KETTLE 
SOMEONE HAD WASHED THE WINDOWS HE COULD SEE STRAIGHT THROUGH 
HE COULD SEE HIS GARDEN AND THE SUN AND HIS NEW NEIGHBOUR LILY SWEET 
HANGING OUT HER CLOTHES 
AND ON THE TABLE INSTEAD OF THE CORNFLAKES BOX 
WAS A DAINTY PLATE OF FAIRY BREAD AND A FLOWER IN A VASE 
WHAT'S THIS SAID BOB AMAZED 
HE SAT DOWN AND ATE SOME FAIRY BREAD TO SETTLE HIS NERVES 
THEN HE GOT A FRIGHT 
THREE TINY CREATURES SKITTERED FROM BEHIND THE FRIDGE 
CRIKEY SAID BOB SO THAT'S IT I GOT ELVES 
THE NEXT DAY WHEN BOB WOKE UP THE HOUSE WAS HORRIBLY CLEAN AND BRIGHT 
THERE WERE FLOWER PETALS IN THE BATH AND FAIRY DUST IN THE CORNFLAKES 
AND ELVES WERE EVERYWHERE 
CRIKEY THIS IS AWFUL GROANED BOB 
BUT THINGS GOT WORSE AND WORSE 
THE ELVES HAD CLEANED HIS WALKING BOOTS 
WASHED HIS SHORTS AND POLISHED HIS HARD HAT 
HE HAD TO GO TO WORK ALL CLEAN HIS MATES JUST LAUGHED AND LAUGHED 
THAT NIGHT BOB STOMPED INTO HIS HOUSE 
DETERMINED TO CLEAN OUT ALL THE ELVES 
BUT WHILE HE'D BEEN AWAY THINGS HAD GOT OUT OF HAND 
CRIKEY IT'S A PLAGUE HE SAID 
TOMORROW NIGHT HIS MATES WERE COMING ROUND FOR CARDS 
HE HAD TO GET RID OF THE ELVES BY THEN BUT HOW 
BOB KNEW HE NEEDED HELP HE ATE SOME FAIRY BREAD TO SETTLE HIS NERVES 
AND THEN HE HAD A BRIGHT IDEA 
ON SATURDAY MORNING BOB WENT TO THE CHEMIST'S SHOP 
CAN I HELP YOU SIR 
BOB WENT RED I GOT AN ELF PROBLEM HE SAID IN A LOW LOW VOICE 
WHAT HEALTH PROBLEM DO YOU HAVE 
NOT HEALTH ELF SAID BOB GOING EVEN REDDER 
I GOT ELVES AT HOME 
HEY LEANNE THIS MAN'S GOT ELVES WE GOT ANYTHING FOR THAT

HE SAID ELVES 
BOB WISHED THAT HE COULD DISAPPEAR 
I'M SORRY WE'RE OUT OF ELFRID THERE'LL BE MORE IN ON TUESDAY 
TUESDAY'S MUCH TOO LATE GROANED BOB AND CREPT AWAY 
AT HOME BOB ATE SOME FAIRY BREAD 
TO SETTLE HIS NERVES 
THEN HE HAD A BRIGHT IDEA 
I KNOW HE SAID 
I'LL GET A BOOK THERE'S BOOKS ON EVERYTHING 
THERE MUST BE ONE TO DEAL WITH THIS 
SO HE WENT TO THE LIBRARY HE'D NEVER BEEN BEFORE 
BEHIND THE COUNTER WAS A LADY IN A BRIGHT GREEN DRESS 
SHE TURNED ROUND AND SAW HIM 
HELLO BOB SHE SAID WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU 
IT WAS LILY SWEET THE LADY WHO'D JUST MOVED IN NEXT DOOR 
BOB WENT VERY VERY RED YOU GOT ANY BOOKS ON ELVES 
HE ASKED IN A LOW LOW VOICE 
YES WE HAVE LOTS OF BOOKS ON THE SHELVES LILY SAID 
WHAT SORT OF BOOK DID YOU WANT 
NOT SHELVES ELVES SAID BOB GOING EVEN REDDER 
OH ELVES SAID LILY SWEET BUT SHE SMILED 
SHE WENT AWAY AND CAME BACK WITH A BIG THICK BOOK 
IT HAD A PICTURE OF ELVES FAIRIES AND PIXIES ON THE FRONT 
BOB THANKED LILY LEFT THE LIBRARY AND CREPT OFF HOME 
TRYING TO HIDE THE BOOK UNDER HIS COAT 
IT WAS THE MOST EMBARRASSING WALK OF HIS LIFE 
WHEN BOB GOT HOME THE ELVES WERE WORSE 
HE ATE SOME FAIRY BREAD TO SETTLE HIS NERVES THEN HAD A BRIGHT IDEA 
HE PITCHED HIS TENT IN THE LIVING ROOM AND ZIPPED HIMSELF INSIDE 
THEN HE READ THE BOOK IN PEACE ALL AFTERNOON 
AT SIX HUNDRED FIVE HE YELLED BINGO HE'D FOUND WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR 
THERE IT WAS IN BLACK AND WHITE ON PAGE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN 
A RECIPE GUARANTEED TO BANISH ELVES FROM HOUSES BOATS AND CARAVANS 
TOMATO SAUCE A CUBE OF ICE A SLICE OF MOULDY CHEESE 
THREE SNIPS OF DIRTY FINGERNAILS AND TWENTY TWO BAKED BEANS 
SOUNDS SIMPLE ENOUGH SAID BOB 
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BAKED BEANS CRIKEY HOWLED BOB I'M ALL OUT 
HE GRABBED HIS WALLET AND RAN OUTSIDE 
BUT WHEN HE GOT TO THE CORNER SHOP IT WAS SHUT 
OPEN UP HE YELLED AND BEAT ON THE DOOR BUT NO ONE WAS THERE 
BOB TRAILED HOME IN DESPAIR 
TWENTY TWO BAKED BEANS HE MUTTERED AS HE WALKED THAT'S ALL I WANTED 
BACK IN HIS HOUSE BOB ATE SOME FAIRY BREAD TO SETTLE HIS NERVES 
THEN HE THOUGHT OF HIS NEIGHBOUR LILY SWEET 
DO LADIES LIKE HER EAT BAKED BEANS HE WONDERED IT WAS WORTH A TRY 
BOB WENT NEXT DOOR AND KNOCKED 
LILY ANSWERED THE DOOR WHEN SHE SAW HIM SHE SMILED 
HELLO BOB SHE SAID WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU 
BOB WENT RED I WAS JUST WONDERING HE MUMBLED 
IF YOU HAVE ANY BAKED BEANS AT ALL 
I'M VERY SORRY BUT I DON'T SAID LILY SWEET 
OH NO GROANED BOB AND CLUTCHED HIS HEAD 
IT'S A RECIPE SEE TOMATO SAUCE A CUBE OF ICE 
A SLICE OF MOULDY CHEESE THREE BITS OF DIRTY FINGERNAIL 
AND TWENTY TWO BAKED BEANS 
A STRANGE EXPRESSION APPEARED ON LILY'S FACE 
BUT ISN'T THAT THE RECIPE FOR GETTING RID OF ELVES 
BOB WENT EVEN REDDER AND HUNG HIS HEAD 
YEAH HE CONFESSED IT WAS IN THAT BOOK I GOT FROM THE LIBRARY 
LILY CLASPED HER HANDS SO DO YOU HAVE ELVES BOB IN YOUR HOUSE NOW 
BOB KNEW HE COULDN'T LIE TO LILY SHE HAD SUCH KIND GREY EYES 
YEAH HE MUTTERED A WHOLE MOB OF 'EM 
THEY'RE DRIVING ME BONKERS AND I CAN'T GET RID OF 'EM 
HE TURNED TO GO BACK HOME NO LILY CRIED DON'T GO 
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT YOUR FAULT BOB SAID HE WAS ASTOUNDED 
OH YES SAID LILY VERY UPSET 
I HAD ELVES AT MY LAST HOUSE THEY MUST HAVE MOVED WITH ME 
LILY SHOOK HER HEAD 
BUT I HAD NO IDEA THEY'D SPREAD INTO YOUR PLACE SHE SAID 
THEY MUST HAVE FOUND A HOLE 
AND ALL THIS TIME THEY'VE BEEN WORRYING YOU I FEEL TERRIBLE 
IF ONLY I'D KNOWN WHY YOU WANTED THAT BOOK CRIED LILY 
I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT RECIPE DOESN'T WORK 
WHAT YELLED BOB DOESN'T WORK 
HE WENT VERY VERY RED THIS TIME IT WASN'T BECAUSE HE WAS EMBARRASSED 
IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS FURIOUS 
YOU MEAN I READ THAT BOOK IN A TENT 
FOR THE WHOLE AFTERNOON FOR NOTHING HE SHOUTED 
LILY NODDED BOB KNEW WHEN HE WAS BEATEN 
THEN I'VE HAD IT LIL HE SAID I'VE SHOT ME BOLT 
IN HALF AN HOUR ME MATES ARE COMING ROUND FOR CARDS 
THEY SEE THOSE ELVES AND I'LL NEVER LIVE IT DOWN 
OH WELL HE STRAIGHTENED HIS SHOULDERS 
THAT'S LIFE 
LILY LOOKED CONFUSED 
BUT IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE THE PROBLEM 
WHY NOT ASK YOUR ELVES TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY FOR A WHILE SHE SAID 
ASK THEM BOB WAS ASTOUNDED ALL OVER AGAIN 
I'VE SHOUTED TILL I'M BLUE IN THE FACE 
BUT SHOUTING WON'T DO ANY GOOD SAID LILY 
ELVES NEVER LISTEN WHEN YOU SHOUT 
YOU HAVE TO SPEAK SOFTLY AND POLITELY TO THEM 
OR WRITE THEM A NOTE THEY LOVE NOTES 
I'M NOT MUCH OF A ONE FOR WRITING NOTES BOB MUMBLED GOING RED AGAIN 
I'LL HELP YOU THEN LILY SAID 
SO LILY AND BOB WENT INTO HIS HOUSE AND SHE HELPED HIM TO WRITE THE NOTE 
THE NOTE SAID 
DEAR ELVES WOULD YOU PLEASE LEAVE THIS HOUSE FROM SIX FIFTY P. M. UNTIL TWO A M. 
I AM EXPECTING GUESTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOURS SINCERELY BOB 
THEY PUT THE NOTE ON THE FRIDGE WHERE ALL THE ELVES COULD SEE IT 
AND FIVE MINUTES LATER THERE WASN'T AN ELF IN SIGHT 
IT'S LIKE MAGIC SAID BOB IT'S JUST POLITE SAID LILY 
I'D BETTER GO YOUR FRIENDS WILL BE HERE BOB TOOK HER TO THE DOOR 
TOMORROW COULD YOU HELP ME 
WRITE A NOTE TO TELL THEM TO GO AWAY FOR GOOD HE ASKED 
LILY LOOKED DOUBTFUL 
I COULD I SUPPOSE BUT ARE YOU SURE YOU REALLY WANT THAT BOB 
I KNOW THEY'RE A BIT OF A NUISANCE SOMETIMES BUT I LIKE HAVING THEM 
THEY DO ALL THE HOUSEWORK THEY MEND MY CLOTHES 
AND THE FAIRY BREAD GIVES ME BRIGHT IDEAS 
BOB FROWNED IN THOUGHT 
CRIKEY YOU MIGHT HAVE A POINT THERE LIL HE SAID AT LAST 
I HAVE HAD A FEW BRIGHT IDEAS LATELY 
AND I'D BE HAPPY NEVER TO PICK UP A BROOM AGAIN 
HOUSEWORK'S A PAIN IN THE NECK 
I AGREE SAID LILY SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO 
BUT BOB DIDN'T QUITE KNOW NOW HE HAD ANOTHER PROBLEM 
HE WANTED THE ELVES TO GO BUT HE WANTED THEM TO STAY AS WELL 
BOB'S MATES ARRIVED SO BOB AND LILY COULDN'T TALK ANY MORE 
BUT AFTER HIS MATES LEFT BOB THOUGHT ABOUT HIS PROBLEM QUITE A LOT 
HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT SO MUCH HE COULDN'T SLEEP 
AT TWO A M. THE ELVES CAME BACK 
THEY CLEANED UP THE GLASSES AND PIZZA BOXES 
THEY SWEPT THE FLOOR AND WASHED UP AND PUT THE FAIRY BREAD ON THE TABLE 
BOB MADE HIMSELF A CUP OF TEA 
SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND ATE SOME FAIRY BREAD TO SETTLE HIS NERVES 
THEN HE HAD A BRIGHT IDEA 
WITHOUT EVEN WAITING FOR LILY SWEET HE WROTE THE ELVES A NOTE 
DEAR ELVES THANKS FOR ALL YOUR WORK AND THE FAIRY BREAD 
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN MY HOUSE PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING RULES 
PLEASE DON'T CLEAN MY WORKING BOOTS OR POLISH MY HARD HAT 
PLEASE DON'T MAKE THE HOUSE TOO TIDY IT MAKES ME NERVOUS 
PLEASE NOTE I LIKE TUNA SANDWICHES OR CHEESE OR PEANUT BUTTER 
NOT FAIRY BREAD OR CAKES 
PLEASE LEAVE THE HOUSE BETWEEN SEVEN P. M. AND TWO A M. ON SATURDAY NIGHTS 
BECAUSE I HAVE GUESTS THEN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOURS SINCERELY BOB 
BOB PUT THE NOTE ON THE FRIDGE 
AND WENT TO BED 
AND AFTER THAT THERE WAS NO MORE TROUBLE 
NOW BOB WASN'T SHOUTING THE ELVES BECAME QUIET AND EASY TO LIVE WITH 
AND THE SATURDAY CARD NIGHTS WERE A GREAT SUCCESS 
BOB'S MATES LIKED THE TIDIER HOUSE 
AND OF COURSE BOB AND LILY SWEET SAW A LOT OF ONE ANOTHER 
THEY HAD PLENTY IN COMMON 
ELVES AND BAKED BEANS AND NOT LIKING HOUSEWORK FOR A START 
THEY HAD LUNCH TOGETHER ON SUNDAYS 
THEN THEY'D GO FOR A WALK IN THE PARK WHILE THE ELVES CLEANED UP 
BOB WASN'T MUCH OF A ONE FOR TALKING ABOUT HIS FEELINGS 
BUT AFTER LUNCH ONE SUNDAY HE KNEW THE TIME HAD COME 
HE'D WORKED OUT JUST WHAT TO SAY 
HE ATE A LAST PIECE OF FAIRY BREAD TO SETTLE HIS NERVES 
HE TOOK LILY'S HAND ACROSS THE TABLE 
LIL HE SAID IN A LOW LOW VOICE 
YOU'RE A SPECIAL LADY HOW ABOUT WE GET HITCHED 
AND LILY SAID THAT WAS THE BRIGHTEST IDEA HE'D EVER HAD 
SO THEY GOT MARRIED 
AND BOB MADE THEIR TWO LITTLE HOUSES INTO ONE BIG ONE 
THE ELVES WERE VERY PLEASED 
THE RENOVATIONS MADE A LOT OF MESS SO THEY HAD PLENTY OF WORK TO DO 
AND BESIDES BEING ELVES 
THERE WAS NOTHING THEY LIKED BETTER THAN A STORY WITH A HAPPY ENDING 
BYE FOR NOW
