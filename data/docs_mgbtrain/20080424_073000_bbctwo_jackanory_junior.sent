THIS IS JACKANORY JUNIOR 
HELLO I'M DANIELA 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A UNICORN IS 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MYSTERIOUS HORSE WITH A HORN ON ITS NOSE 
SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT UNICORNS DON'T EXIST 
OTHERS BELIEVE THEY DO WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THIS STORY IS CALLED THE PRINCESS AND THE UNICORN 
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A PRINCESS CALLED LILY 
HER FAVOURITE ANIMAL WAS A UNICORN 
HER FATHER THE KING GAVE LILY A TIRED SMILE 
THERE ARE NO UNICORNS ANY MORE HE SAID 
UNICORNS WOULD BE FUN TO CHASE 
SAID HER ELDER BROTHER HAROLD WHO SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME HUNTING 
UNICORNS ARE JUST STORIES SAID HER OTHER BROTHER GERALD 
WHO SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME READING 
YOU'VE GOT CANDLE WAX IN YOUR HAIR AGAIN GERALD SAID LILY 
AND I'D BET A UNICORN WOULD CHASE YOU HAROLD 
THEN ONE AUTUMN DAY THE KING FELL ILL 
NO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS WRONG THE PALACE DOCTORS SHOOK THEIR HEADS 
MAYBE IT WAS HIS HEART OR HIS SOUL THAT WAS SICK 
GO AWAY SAID THE KING AND HE PULLED THE SILK SHEETS OVER HIS HEAD 
THE NEXT DAY THE CHIEF MINISTER OFFERED TWENTY GOLD COINS 
TO ANYONE WHO COULD CURE THE KING 
SOON HALF THE KINGDOM WERE QUEUING TO TRY THEIR LUCK 
IT TOOK WEEKS FOR THEM ALL TO TRY THEIR CURES 
AND NO ONE WAS LEFT TO WORK IN THE FIELDS 
EVENTUALLY RAIN RUINED THE WHEAT CROP 
AND A PLAGUE OF MICE BEGAN TO EAT WHAT WAS LEFT 
NEXT CALLED GERALD A DOCTOR IN PIN STRIPED ROBES STEPPED FORWARD 
MY MIRACLE MIXTURE HAS CURED MILLIONS HE ANNOUNCED 
JUST PLASTER IT ON THE ROYAL BALD PATCH 
TRIED IT SAID HAROLD DIDN'T WORK NEXT 
A YOUNG WOMAN SMILED NERVOUSLY 
AND SAID TIE THESE BUTTERCUPS UNDER HIS CHIN 
I'M GOING TO SPLIT THE REWARD WITH HER WHAT'S HALF OF TWENTY 
BUT BUTTERCUPS DIDN'T CURE THE KING EITHER THE NEXT MORNING 
AN OLD WOMAN DRESSED IN BLACK LIMPED FORWARD 
I KNOW WHAT THE KING NEEDS SHE SAID 
HER SHAWL IS TATTY HAROLD WHISPERED TO GERALD 
LOOK AT HER HAIR CHIN 
SHE SMELLS SAID GERALD WRINKLING HIS NOSE OW 
SORRY GERALD WAS THAT YOUR TOE SAID LILY 
THIS WAY GRANDMOTHER 
THE ONLY THING THAT MIGHT CURE THE KING SAID THE OLD WOMAN 
IS A UNICORN 
THE KING TURNED OVER AND SAT UP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE DAYS 
YOU'RE ONE OF THE WISE WOMEN HE SAID 
BUT I BANISHED ALL THE WISE WOMEN FROM THE KINGDOM 
YES YEARS AGO SAID THE OLD WOMAN WHEN THIS ONE WAS BORN 
SHE NODDED AT LILY AND THE QUEEN DIED 
YOU BLAMED US ALTHOUGH WE DIDN'T CAUSE HER DEATH 
WE JUST COULDN'T HELP HER 
I STILL MISS HER SAID THE KING I WANT TO BE WITH HER 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR KINGDOM SAID THE OLD WOMAN 
I'M TOO TIRED TO CARE ABOUT IT SAID THE KING 
WHAT YOUR KINGDOM NEEDS IS A UNICORN TO RESTORE IT SAID THE OLD WOMAN 
TO BRING THE OLD MAGIC BACK TO THE LAND 
AND TO MAKE MY FATHER BETTER ASKED LILY PERHAPS SAID THE OLD WOMAN 
IF HE REALLY WANTS TO BE OH YES SAID LILY 
WHERE CAN WE FIND A UNICORN 
IN THE LAND BEYOND THE SUNSET SHE SAID 
ONLY THE BRAVEST AND MOST LOVING CAN BRING ONE BACK 
AND ONLY THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THEM CAN FIND THEM 
IF MY KINGDOM NEEDS A UNICORN SAID THE KING 
THEN WHOEVER BRINGS ME THE UNICORN WILL BE THE NEW RULER 
HAROLD PUFFED OUT HIS CHEST 
I'M THE ELDEST AND THE BRAVEST I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID 
AND I'LL BE BACK WITH A UNICORN THE VERY NEXT DAY 
SO THE NEXT MORNING HAROLD SET OUT ON HIS BIG BLACK HORSE 
THROUGH THE FOREST TOWARDS THE LAND BEYOND THE SUNSET AFTER A WEEK 
HE WAS STILL NOT BACK AND THE KING WAS GETTING WORSE 
I'VE READ EVERYTHING ABOUT UNICORNS SAID GERALD 
EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T EXIST 
I'LL GO TOMORROW AND I'LL BE BACK WITH A UNICORN THE VERY NEXT DAY 
SO THE NEXT MORNING GERALD SET OUT ON HIS WHITE HORSE 
THROUGH THE FOREST TOWARDS THE LAND BEYOND THE SUNSET 
THE FIRST FEW SNOWFLAKES WERE SWIRLING DOWN 
AFTER A WEEK HE WAS STILL NOT BACK 
AND THE KING'S EYES WERE MORE SUNKEN THAN EVER 
LILY STOOD UP FROM HIS BEDSIDE I'LL GO SHE SAID 
YOU CAN'T GO SAID HER FATHER YOU'RE A GIRL 
GIRLS CAN BE BRAVE SAID LILY AND I BELIEVE IN UNICORNS 
HER FATHER HAD NOTHING MORE TO SAY FOR A MOMENT 
THEN HE SAT UP IN BED YOU'D BETTER TAKE THIS HE SAID 
AND REACHED UNDER HIS PILLOW 
HE OPENED UP A CRIMSON SILK WRAPPING BROUGHT OUT A DRIED WHITE ROSE 
AND KISSED IT YOUR MOTHER GAVE ME THIS HE SAID 
YOU'LL KNOW WHEN TO USE IT I BELIEVED IN UNICORNS ONCE MYSELF 
AND HE LAY BACK AND CLOSED HIS EYES 
SO THE NEXT MORNING LILY KISSED HER FATHER GOODBYE 
I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS I CAN SHE SAID 
THEN SHE WRAPPED HERSELF UP TIGHTLY AND SET OUT ON FOOT 
THROUGH THE FOREST TOWARDS THE LAND BEYOND THE SUNSET 
LILY HADN'T GONE FAR BEFORE SHE SAW AN OLD WOMAN BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
GREETINGS GRANDMOTHER SAID LILY 
IS THIS THE WAY TO THE LAND BEYOND THE SUNSET 
IT IS SAID THE OLD WOMAN 
AND HAVE YOU SEEN MY BROTHERS RIDING THIS WAY LILY ASKED 
DO YOU MEAN THE FELLOW IN GREEN ON THE BIG BLACK HORSE 
THAT SHOUTS OUT OF THE WAY AND THE CHAP IN MAUVE ON THE WHITE HORSE 
WITH HIS NOSE IN A BOOK WHO NEARLY RIDES FOLK DOWN SAID THE OLD WOMAN 
OH DEAR SAID LILY THEY'RE MY BROTHERS I'M SORRY THEY WERE RUDE 
WOULD YOU LIKE ONE OF MY WHEAT CAKES 
THANK YOU SAID THE OLD WOMAN 
TAKE THIS IN EXCHANGE 
AND SHE GAVE LILY A WHITE ROPE FINE AS COBWEBS 
FOLDED UP INTO A WALNUT SHELL 
YOU WILL KNOW WHEN TO USE IT SAID THE OLD WOMAN 
THANK YOU GRANDMOTHER SAID LILY 
SHE SLIPPED THE WALNUT SAFELY INTO HER UNICORN SHAPED PURSE 
LATER THAT FROZEN AFTERNOON AS LILY WALKED SHE HEARD GROWLING 
AHEAD OF HER SHE SAW A WHITE BEAR BY THE ROADSIDE 
LILY'S HEART FLIP FLOPPED 
BUT SHE NOTICED THE BEAR WAS LICKING A FRONT PAW SO SHE WENT UP TO IT 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR PAW SHE SAID 
A HUNTER IN GREEN CAMPED HERE TWO WEEKS AGO HE LEFT A TRAP 
SAID THE BEAR HOLDING UP HIS PAW 
LILY SAW A CRUEL WIRE BURIED IN THE SWOLLEN FLESH 
LAST WEEK ANOTHER MAN RODE BY ON A WHITE HORSE 
BUT HE LOOKED STRAIGHT THROUGH ME 
AND SAID THERE ARE NO BEARS IN THIS FOREST THEN HE RODE AWAY 
OH DEAR SAID LILY YOU'VE MET MY BROTHERS TOO SHOW ME YOUR PAW 
HER SCISSORS WEREN'T STRONG ENOUGH SO LILY TOOK OUT THE POCKET KNIFE 
BE BRAVE SHE SAID TO THE BEAR AND CUT THE WIRE 
THE BEAR ROARED WITH PAIN 
LILY CLOSED HER EYES SO SHE WOULDN'T SEE HERSELF BEING EATEN 
THAT'S BETTER SAID THE BEAR AND LILY OPENED ONE EYE 
THE BEAR WINKED BACK 
NOW TAKE THREE HAIRS FROM MY NECK FUR HE SAID 
YOU'LL KNOW WHEN TO USE THEM 
LILY BOUND UP THE BEAR'S PAW AND PUT THE THREE HAIRS SAFELY IN HER POCKET 
THEN SHE WENT ON WALKING WEST 
BUT WHEN THE ORANGE SUN WENT DOWN THE SUNSET WAS AS FAR AWAY AS EVER 
I'LL NEVER GET THERE SHE THOUGHT AND I'M SO TIRED 
AS SHE SPOKE SHE FELT THE BEAR'S HAIRS TICKLE IN HER POCKET 
WHEN SHE PULLED THEM OUT THEY RIPPLED 
AND GREW INTO A WHITE BEARSKIN JUST RIGHT TO WARM A COLD PRINCESS 
I WISH I WAS IN THE LAND BEYOND THE SUNSET SHE SAID SLEEPILY 
THEN SHE SNUGGLED INTO THE BEARSKIN AND CLOSED HER EYES 
SHE DIDN'T EVEN FEEL HERSELF START TO RISE 
THE NEXT MORNING LILY AWOKE IN A DIFFERENT LAND 
THE GRASS WAS SHORT GREEN AS VELVET 
IT WAS EMBROIDERED WITH STRANGE FLOWERS 
AND EVERYTHING SPARKLED WITH DEW 
THIS IS MAGICAL WHISPERED LILY 
I MUST BE IN THE LAND BEYOND THE SUNSET 
SHE LEAPT UP AND THERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER WAS A UNICORN 
ITS CURVED FLANKS GLEAMED AND YES 
ITS SPIRAL HORN SHONE AS IF IT WAS MADE OF PURE SILVER 
WILL YOU COME WITH ME TO SAVE MY FATHER ASKED LILY 
BUT THE UNICORN JUST LOOKED AT HER WITH ITS SOFT EYES 
SUDDENLY LILY FELT THE DRIED WHITE ROSE IN HER POCKET FLUTTER AND SWELL 
AS SHE TOOK IT OUT SHE SAW THAT THE ROSE WAS FRESH AGAIN 
SHE HELD IT OUT IN HER HAND TO THE UNICORN 
THE UNICORN SNIFFED IT DEEPLY AND THEN LOWERED ITS HEAD TO LILY 
SHE OPENED HER WALNUT SHELL TOOK OUT THE ROPE 
SLIPPING IT OVER THE UNICORN'S HEAD 
THEN SHE LED THE UNICORN DOWN TO THE SEA 
THERE THE WALNUT SHELL GREW BIG ENOUGH TO BE A BOAT 
AND LILY LED THE UNICORN ABOARD 
BACK OVER THE SEA OF SLEEP SHE JOURNEYED 
THE NEXT MORNING LILY LED THE UNICORN THROUGH THE FOREST 
UNTIL SHE SAW HER FATHER'S CASTLE 
THERE ON THE EDGE OF THE FOREST SHE SAW HER BROTHER HAROLD 
WHEN HE SAW LILY HE SHOUTED 
GOOD GIRL STEP TO ONE SIDE I'LL SHOOT THE BEAST 
NO CRIED LILY DON'T YOU DARE 
SHE FLUNG HER ARMS AROUND ITS NECK UNTIL HER BROTHER LOWERED HIS BOW 
OUT LIMPED A WHITE HORSE WITH ITS HEAD DROOPING 
GERALD SITTING ON ITS BACK SNAPPED HIS BOOK SHUT 
WELL DONE LILY HE CALLED 
I'LL TAKE IT NOW I KNOW ALL ABOUT UNICORNS 
HE RODE CLOSE BUT THE UNICORN FLASHED ITS EYES AT HIM AND SNORTED 
YOU'D BETTER LEAD IT YOURSELF SUGGESTED HAROLD LILY DID 
THE UNICORN STEPPED CAREFULLY AS IF IT WAS USED TO PALACES 
AT EVERY STEP THE MARBLE FLOOR RANG LIKE A BELL 
LILY HARDLY NOTICED ALL SHE COULD THINK ABOUT WAS HER FATHER 
WERE THEY TOO LATE 
THERE LAY HER FATHER EYES CLOSED 
WE'RE BACK FATHER SAID LILY 
HERE'S THE UNICORN LILY HELD HER BREATH 
UNTIL SHE SAW THE CORNERS OF HER FATHER'S MOUTH CURVE 
WHEN THE SMILE REACHED HIS EYES THEY OPENED SLOWLY 
LILY HE SAID DID YOU REALLY FIND A UNICORN 
YES FATHER SHE WHISPERED 
LOOK HOW HE SHINES 
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE A UNICORN THANK YOU SAID THE KING 
HE HELD LILY IN A LONG HUG 
OH FATHER SHE SAID 
IT'S ALL RIGHT CHILD HE SAID STROKING HER HAIR 
I'M READY TO GO YOU'LL MAKE A FINE RULER 
LEAVE HIM NOW SAID THE CHIEF MINISTER 
LILY LED THE UNICORN TO THE PALACE GARDENS 
AS IT ENTERED THE SNOW MELTED AWAY FROM THE GRAVE IN THE MIDDLE 
LEAVES SPRANG FRESH AND GREEN AROUND IT 
BLUEBELLS PUSHED THEIR WAY UP 
LILY WAS TOO SAD TO SMILE 
THEN SHE FELT THE UNICORN'S HORN NUDGE HER 
LILY FLUNG HER ARMS AROUND ITS SOFT NECK AND WEPT 
SHE SAW THE CHIEF MINISTER IN FRONT OF HER HOLDING A CRIMSON ROBE 
HAROLD AND GERALD WERE STANDING BEHIND HIM 
THEY ALL KNELT AND SAID LONG LIVE THE QUEEN 
LILY LOOKED AT THE UNICORN STANDING NEXT TO HER MOTHER'S GRAVE 
AND KNEW THAT NO ONE COULD STOP THE TURNING OF THE SEASONS 
NOT EVEN A KING'S DAUGHTER ALL THE BELLS OF THE KINGDOM WERE TOLLING 
LILY STOOD AND WATCHED THE UNICORN WALKING THROUGH THE GARDENS 
WHERE ITS HOOVES TOUCHED FLOWERS SPRANG 
PEOPLE POINTED AND WHISPERED LILY RAISED HER HAND 
GOODBYE SHE CALLED THANK YOU 
SHE KNEW THE UNICORN HAD HEARD BEFORE IT WALKED AWAY 
TOWARDS A LAND BEYOND THE SUNSET 
THEN LILY TURNED TO HER BROTHERS 
HAROLD SHE SAID WE SHOULD ONLY HUNT ANIMALS FOR FOOD 
AND LOOK AT PLANTING NEW CROPS 
HAROLD SHRUGGED AND THEN HE NODDED 
WATCH IT SAID LILY TO HER ELDEST BROTHER AND HUGGED HIM 
YOU'RE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND FORESTS NOW 
GERALD SHE SAID TO HER OTHER BROTHER 
I WANT EVERY CHILD TO BE GIVEN A BOOK TO MARK THIS DAY 
YOU'RE THE NEW MINISTER FOR EDUCATION 
THEN SHE TURNED TO THE CHIEF MINISTER 
THE PALACE GARDEN NEEDS ROSES IN CASE WE NEED A UNICORN AGAIN 
OF COURSE YOUR MAJESTY HE SAID AND BOWED 
LILY LOOKED AT THE FRESH SPRING FLOWERS 
SPARKLING IN THE SUN AND SMILED 
BYE FOR NOW
