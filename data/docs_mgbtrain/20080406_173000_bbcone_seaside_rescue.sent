AS CLOSE TO THE CARAVAN AS WE CAN AVOIDING THE POWER LINES AND WE'RE JUST HAVING TO BE ULTRA CAREFUL 
IT'S FIVE A M. THE TWENTY FIRST JULY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
COAST GUARD RESCUE HELICOPTER WHISKY BRAVO HAS BEEN TASKED TO A NATIONAL DISASTER 
WE'RE HEADING OFF TOWARDS TEWKSBURY 
THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN LASHED BY TORRENTIAL STORMS 
IN SOME AREAS TWO MONTHS' WORTH OF RAIN HAS FALLEN IN JUST TWELVE HOURS 
THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST EMERGENCIES BRITAIN HAS FACED IN PEACETIME 
THE RESCUE INVOLVES ALL THE EMERGENCY SERVICES 
WHAT A SHAME 
WHAT A MESS 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE RIVERS ARE AT IS THAT THE RIVER JUST DOWN HERE 
INSTEAD OF PATROLLING THE SOUTH COAST WHISKY BRAVO IS COMING INLAND 
A PRETTY BAD SITUATION AS WE UNDERSTAND 
BUT OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN WE ARRIVE THERE 
EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY THE RNLI AND COAST GUARD ARE ON HAND 
TO KEEP THE BRITISH PUBLIC SAFE FROM THE PERILS OF THE COAST 
THE SUMMER IS THEIR BUSIEST TIME BUT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IS TESTING THE RESCUE SERVICES TO THE LIMIT 
VERY ROUGH SEAS TODAY VERY MESSY SURF 
PROBABLY THE WORST START TO JULY I CAN REMEMBER 
WE'VE GOT HOWLING SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS 
MASSIVE SURF PROBABLY SIX F. T. OR SEVEN F. T. WAVES COMING IN 
THE MET OFFICE HAVE ISSUED A WARNING TODAY NOT ONLY OF HEAVY RAIN BUT OF GALE FORCE WINDS AS WELL 
IT JUST SEEMS TO BE THE WAY THAT THE SEASON'S PANNING OUT 
THE WEATHER IS A BIT TEMPERAMENTAL 
IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO TRAVEL THIS EVENING BASICALLY I THINK I'D FORGET IT 
WHISKY BRAVO'S FIRST LOCATION IS A CARAVAN PARK IN WARWICKSHIRE 
WHISKY BRAVO IS NOW ON SCENE AT THE CARAVAN PARK 
THE RIVER AVON IS FIVE TIMES ITS NORMAL HEIGHT 
THE RESIDENTS AREN'T HOLIDAY MAKERS THEY LIVE HERE 
I'VE GOT A WOMAN DOWN HERE O. K. 
TWO DOWN HERE AT ONE O'CLOCK 
ONE ON THE NOSE AS WELL YEAH O. K. 
SO MANY HAVE DEFIED ALL CALLS TO EVACUATE 
RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE READY THEN PLEASE 
HANDBRAKES ARE OFF

JUST DOWN THERE FORWARD AND RIGHT 
THE WINCH MAN IS DAVE PEEL 
STEADY STEADY STEADY STEADY 
THE RIVER IS STILL RISING IT WILL BE INSIDE THIS CARAVAN IN MINUTES 
HELLO 
I ASSUME YOU WANT THE DOGS TO GO WITH YOU

I'LL WANT YOU IN THE AIR WITH THIS DOG AND THE ALSATIAN WHEN THE ALSATIAN COMES UP 
ARE THERE MORE PEOPLE OVER THERE 
THERE'S ONE LADY ON THE CORNER AND SHE'S GOT TWO DOGS AS WELL O. K. 
A BAG THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE USED TO AIRLIFT BABIES IS GOING TO BE VERY BUSY LIFTING DOGS

NOT REALLY I THINK IF WE GET TIME YEAH O. K. YEAH 
HE COULDN'T CLOSE THE DOOR BUT THAT'S JUST TOO BAD 
NO THAT'S ALL RIGHT 
O. K. 
THE FIRST CASUALTIES ARE SAFE AND DRY BUT THERE'S NO RESPITE FOR WHISKY BRAVO 
IT'S STARTING TO SMELL ROUND HERE IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT 
RIGHT ANYWHERE AROUND HERE I THINK 
LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE ON THE STERN OF THIS BOAT 
YEAH THERE'S A CHAP THERE 
PERRANPORTH IN CORNWALL 
BEFORE THE BEACH OPENS TO THE PUBLIC THE LIFEGUARDS VOLUNTEER FOR AN EXTRA SHIFT 
IT'S THE ANNUAL SURF ROWER'S COMPETITION 
AND LIFEGUARD SIMON CRAYFORD IS NO STRANGER TO THE SPORT 
THESE BOATS WERE THE ORIGINAL RESCUE BOATS IN AUSTRALIA 
SO THAT'S WHERE THE SPORT SIDE OF IT CAME FROM 
ALL THE CREWS THAT WERE USING THEM AS THEIR RESCUE TOOLS LIKE WE USE A JET SKI OR R. B. NOW 
WANTING TO IMPROVE THEIR SKILLS AND PUSH EACH OTHER SO YEAH 
GOT A LOT OF HISTORY IN THIS SPORT IT'S GOOD 
WITH ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY KILOS OF BOATS TO STEER THROUGH CHOPPY WATERS 
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE RACE CLAIMS ITS FIRST CASUALTY 
SOMEONE'S HURT HERSELF 
DONE HER BACK IN AND BLEEDING 
HAVE YOU SEEN THE STATE OF YOUR BACK 
IT'S A GRAZE 
RIGHT WE'LL TAKE YOU INTO THE FIRST AID ROOM AND GET YOU WARM THANK YOU 
THIS IS RESCUE WHISKY BRAVO WE ARE ON SCENE AT THE BARGE 
IN FLOOD WATERS A BOAT MAY SEEM THE SAFEST PLACE TO BE 
BUT BELOW THE SURFACE THERE ARE MANY DANGERS THAT COULD SINK THE VESSEL 
ALL THE COUPLE CAN DO IS WATCH AS THEIR HOME AND POSSESSIONS DRIFT ON BY 
I'M SURPRISED THE DOG DIDN'T BITE DAVE ACTUALLY 
HE'S BEEN VERY GOOD WITH THE DOGS 
ALL THOSE RESCUED ARE TAKEN TO A TEMPORARY REFUGE 
THE VILLAGE PUB 
CASUALTIES ARE NOT SO MUCH BEING PICKED UP AS PATCHED UP ON PERRANPORTH BEACH 
IT'S HARD TO BREATHE I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN WHACKED HARD ON ONE SIDE 
IT'S JUST IF I CAN JUST IF SOMEONE CAN TWIST 
THANK YOU 
IN THE SECOND RACE SIMON HAS BEEN PERSUADED TO HAVE A GO HIMSELF 
BIT NERVOUS HAVEN'T DONE IT FOR A WHILE SO 
HA HA 
CONDITIONS ARE GETTING A BIT WORSE WESTERLY GALES ARE COMING IN THIS RAIN SQUALL HAS COME 
SO I THINK THIS ONE COULD BE A LITTLE BIT ENTERTAINING NOW 
THIS IS THE MEN'S RACE AND THAT ALONE SPELLS TROUBLE 
UH OH 
ALL RIGHT 
THE WAVE JUST SWEPT US BACKWARDS THE NOSE WAS RIGHT UP IN THE AIR SO THE WIND TURNED IT 
AND THEN IT FILLED UP WITH WATER AND THEN WE WERE JUST GOING BACKWARDS 
AND WE JUST HAD TO JUMP OUT AND LUCKILY THE LIFEGUARDS WERE THERE 
SURPRISED MY HEAD'S STILL ON

WINCH OPERATOR MICK ROUSEL IS MAKING HIS OWN RECORD OF THE DRAMATIC LANDSCAPE 
THERE'S ANOTHER TWO PEOPLE DOWN HERE IN THIS CARAVAN AS WELL 
GOT SOME PYLONS JUST COMING THROUGH THIS VILLAGE 
WORKING THIS FAR INLAND PRESENTS ITS OWN DIFFICULTIES 
ALL AROUND ARE POWER LINES AND THEY'RE RUNNING 
PARALLEL TO THE CARAVANS THEY ARE FEEDING THE CARAVANS 
NOW THESE LINES ARE LIVE 
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE WINCHING TO A NARROW AREA AND WE WANT TO GET 
AS CLOSE TO THE CARAVAN AS WE CAN AVOIDING THE POWER LINES AND WE'RE JUST HAVING TO BE ULTRA CAREFUL 
AND MAKING SURE THAT DAVE GETS EXACTLY WHERE WE INTEND TO PUT HIM
