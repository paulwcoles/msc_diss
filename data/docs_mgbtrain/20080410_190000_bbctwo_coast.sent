WE'VE CROSSED THE IRISH SEA TO BEGIN THE SCOTTISH LEG OF OUR EPIC JOURNEY 
AROUND THE ENTIRE COAST OF THE U. K. 
SO FAR WE'VE TRAVELLED ALONG THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF ENGLAND ROUND WALES 
NORTH FROM LIVERPOOL AND AROUND THE COAST OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
UNCOVERING THE STORIES THAT HAVE SHAPED US AS AN ISLAND NATION 
THIS PART OF OUR GRAND TOUR TAKES US AROUND THE JAGGED WEST COAST OF SCOTLAND 
NOWHERE ELSE IN THE U. K. IS THERE SUCH AN INTRICATE TANGLE 
OF ISLANDS LOCHS AND SOUNDS 
AND IT'S THIS CHAOS OF ISLANDS AND INLETS THAT HAS SHAPED LIFE HERE ON THE ROCKY WEST 
DONNING THEIR SOU'WESTERS AND HOPPING AROUND WITH ME IS OUR USUAL TEAM OF EXPERTS 
HISTORIAN NEIL OLIVER JOINS THE ROYAL NAVY TO FIND OUT 
WHY THIS STRETCH OF COAST IS HOME TO THE U. K.'S ENTIRE NUCLEAR ARSENAL 
ZOOLOGIST MIRANDA KRESTOVNIKOFF GOES ON THE HUNT FOR MINKE WHALES OFF THE ISLAND OF RHUM 
ANTHROPOLOGIST ALICE ROBERTS WITNESSES THE RE BIRTH OF GLASGOW SHIPBUILDING 
AS ELEVEN THOUSAND TONNES OF STEEL IS CHEERED DOWN THE SLIPWAY 
AND WHILE I DISCOVER HOW THE SCOTTISH KING JAMES V. CRUSHED THE MIGHTY CLANS OF THE WESTERN ISLES 
LAUNCH MARK HORTON GETS A CRASH COURSE IN GERMAN ROCKET SCIENCE ON THE ISLAND OF SCARP 
WELCOME TO THE WEST COAST OF SCOTLAND 
THIS NEXT LEG OF OUR JOURNEY TAKES US FROM THE FIRTH OF CLYDE TO THE OUTER HEBRIDES 
AS THE SEAGULL FLIES IT'S ONLY THREE HUNDRED MILES BUT ADD IN THE DOZENS 
OF ISLANDS ANCHORED OFF THIS RUGGED COASTLINE AND WE ARE TALKING THOUSANDS OF MILES 
LIFE ON THE WEST COAST IS GOVERNED AS MUCH BY THE SEA AS BY THE LAND 
SO WHAT BETTER WAY OF GETTING TO KNOW ITS GEOGRAPHY THAN ON THIS CLASSIC SCOTTISH SAILING KETCH 
SKIPPER ANDREW RITCHIE HAS HAD A LIFELONG LOVE AFFAIR WITH THIS STRETCH OF COAST 
WHAT MAKES THIS SUCH A GREAT PLACE TO SAIL ANDREW 
I'VE SAILED IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD AND I STILL THINK 
THE WEST COAST OF SCOTLAND IS THE FINEST SAILING AREA IN THE WORLD 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE WEST COAST THE FRESHNESS OF THE AIR 
YOU'VE GOT SANDY SHORES AND ROCKY SEA CLIFFS THAT COME DOWN 
YOU'VE GOT THE MOUNTAINS OF SKYE THAT COME UP TO THE SEA 
THE VARIETY OF SAILING IS BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD 
IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE MOST HAZARDOUS ISN'T IT 
IT HAS ITS PLACES AND IT HAS ITS MOMENTS 
THE ATLANTIC SHORE WIND CAN GET UP IN NO TIME AND YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF 
IN A LOT HEAVIER WEATHER THAN YOU ORIGINALLY EXPECTED 
ONE OF ONE OF THE GREAT ADVANTAGES OF SAILING ON THE WEST COAST 
IS THAT THE COAST IS SO JAGGED THERE'S ALWAYS SOME PLACE YOU CAN GET SAFE ANCHORAGE 
AND YOU CAN GET UNDER COVER WITHIN A SHORT SAILING TIME 
SO FAR MY EXPERIENCE OF SCOTLAND'S WEST COAST HAS BEEN WINDSWEPT AND CAREFREE 
BUT NOWHERE IN THE BRITISH ISLES HAS SO MUCH HEAVY METAL BEEN PUT TO SEA THAN HERE ON THE RIVER CLYDE 
FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS IF IT WAS PLOUGHING OF THE WORLD'S GREAT SEA LANES CHANCES ARE IT WAS BUILT HERE 
SAILING AND BOAT BUILDING HAS BEEN PART OF THE CULTURE AROUND HERE FOR CENTURIES 
AND NOWHERE IS THAT LEGACY MORE EVIDENT THAN ON THE RIVER CLYDE 
FOR GENERATIONS THE RIVER CLYDE LAY AT THE HEART OF GLASGOW'S PROSPERING ECONOMY 
WITH A MASSIVE SHIPBUILDING HERITAGE THAT SAW HUGE IRON CLAD VESSELS 
SAIL TO THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE WORLD 
TO BE CLYDE BUILT WAS SEEN AS A MARK OF QUALITY CRAFTSMANSHIP AND RELIABILITY 
BUT DECADES OF FIERCE FOREIGN COMPETITION SPELT THE END OF GLASGOW'S GOLDEN AGE OF SHIPPING 
THE DOCKYARDS SLID INTO DECLINE DISUSE AND NEGLECT 
BUT SOME REFUSE TO DIE 
TODAY IT'S NO WONDER THAT ANY NEW SHIP IS MET WITH JUBILANT CELEBRATION 
ALICE ROBERTS IS QUAYSIDE AS GLASGOW'S MOST FAMOUS INDUSTRY TRUMPETS ITS LATEST CREATION 
AT THIS DOCK IN GOVAN AMIDST A WAVE OF POMP AND CEREMONY 
THEY'RE ABOUT TO NAME AND LAUNCH THE ROYAL FLEET AUXILIARY'S NAVY SUPPORT SHIP CARDIGAN BAY 
ELEVEN THOUSAND TONNES MUST SLIP MAJESTICALLY ONTO THE RIVER CLYDE 
THE CARDIGAN BAY IS THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY FIRST VESSEL TO BE LAUNCHED FROM THIS DOCK IN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS 
FOR THE WORKERS WHO HAVE SPENT THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUILDING HER LAUNCH DAY IS A MOMENTOUS OCCASION 
IT IS ALSO A NERVE JANGLING ONE 
ONLY LAST YEAR THE CARDIGAN'S SISTER SHIP HIT TROUBLE LITERALLY 
WHEN SHE SLID DOWN THE SLIPWAY STRAIGHT INTO A CONCRETE WALL 
IT WAS AN EMBARRASSING DENT TO THEIR PRIDE AND ONE THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN 
CO ORDINATING THIS LAUNCH IS SCOTT JAMIESON 
NOW ON THE LAUNCH OF THE SISTER SHIP THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM 
WHEN YOU LAUNCH A SHIP THIS SIZE 
THERE ARE A LOT OF VARIABLES AND IT IS A VERY COMPLEX PROCESS 
THE DIRECTION WASN'T QUITE RIGHT AND SHE TRAVELLED FURTHER THAN WE WANTED HER TO 
HOW MUCH FURTHER 
SHE MADE SLIGHT CONTACT WITH THE OPPOSITE END OF THE RIVER 
BUT IT WASN'T THAT BIG A DEAL VERY MINOR DAMAGE 
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IT WON'T HAPPEN THIS YEAR 
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING GOES SMOOTHLY YEAH 
SCOTT I HAVE TO SAY I AM EVER SO SLIGHTLY NERVOUS BEING UNDERNEATH THOUSANDS OF TONS OF SHIP 
SO WHAT'S STOPPING HER SLIDING DOWN 
WE HAVE FOUR HYDRAULIC RAMS WHICH PUSH AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE SHIP AND HOLD HER IN POSITION 
HALF AN HOUR BEFORE WE LAUNCH THE SHIP WE START TO TAKE THESE AWAY 
WE'LL PRESS THE BUTTON THAT RELEASES THE TRIGGERS AND SHE'LL START TO SLIDE INTO THE CLYDE RIGHT 
I THINK I NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE 
LAST YEAR ONE OF THE FOUR DRAG CHAINS THAT SLOW THE SHIP DOWN SNAPPED FREE 
IT WAS ENOUGH TO SPELL DISASTER 
THIS YEAR THE LAUNCH TEAM ARE TAKING NO CHANCES AND ARE ATTACHING TWO EXTRA SIXTY TONNE DRAG CHAINS 
SO THERE'LL BE THREE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SHIP 
WITH ONLY A FEW HOURS TO GO THE FINAL PREPARATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT 
GLASGOW'S PASSION FOR BIG SHIPS STILL BURNS BRIGHT AND LAUNCH DAY IS ALWAYS A CARNIVAL 
CAN I ASK YOU HAVE YOU ANY FAMILY CONNECTIONS WITH THE SHIP 
MY COUSIN JOHN WORKED ON IT 
OH REALLY IS HE UP THERE ON DECK HE'S ON THERE NOW 
HAVE YOU SEEN A SHIP LAUNCHED NO THIS IS MY FIRST TIME 
IS IT A BIG DAY FOR GLASGOW 
YES VERY BIG WHY IS IT SO BIG 
WELL TRADITION 
A GLASGOW TRADITION 
SHIPBUILDING ON THE CLYDE SECOND TO NONE IN THE WORLD 
WE USED TO DO THIS TWICE A MONTH REALLY SHIPS THIS SIZE 
THAT'S A SMALL ONE BY THE WAY RIGHT BUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THEY STILL BUILD THEM HERE 
AS THE CROWDS LINE UP AND THE V. I. P.'S ARRIVE IT ALL LOOKS PERFECT 
LADY STANHOPE IS GETTING READY TO NAME THE SHIP AND LAUNCH HER AND UNDERNEATH THE SHIP 
THE LAST MINUTE CHECKS ARE BEING HELD TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING GOES SMOOTHLY 
BUT BELOW THE SHIP IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY THE LAUNCH WAS SCHEDULED FOR HIGH TIDE 
WHICH SHOULD HAVE GUARANTEED A HEALTHY THREE METRES OF WATER TO CARRY HER MASSIVE BULK 
BUT STRONG NORTHERLY WINDS HAVE BLOWN THE TIDE BACK OUT TO SEA 
THE RESULT THE CLYDE IS NOW TOO SHALLOW TO LAUNCH THE SHIP SAFELY 
THE SHIP IS NAMED BUT THE ACTUAL LAUNCH IS POSTPONED TILL TOMORROW 
I NAME THIS SHIP CARDIGAN BAY 
MAY GOD BLESS HER AND ALL WHO SAIL IN HER 
IT'S THE MORNING AFTER THE NAMING CEREMONY AND THE LAUNCH IS BACK ON TRACK 
WITH ONLY HALF AN HOUR TO GO THE BURNER IS CALLED IN TO REMOVE THE FOUR SUPPORTING SPURS 
FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE WEIGHT OF SHIP HAS BEEN HELD BACK BY THE STEEL GIRDERS 
ONCE GONE THERE'LL BE NO STOPPING HER SLIDING INEXORABLY INTO THE WATER THERE'LL BE NO TURNING BACK 
SHE'S MOVING COME ON GET HER MOVING 
THE SHIP IS READY TO LAUNCH 
ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA BY RICHARD STRAUSS 
THREE CHEERS FOR THE CARDIGAN BAY HIP HIP HOORAY 
HIP HIP HOORAY HIP HIP HOORAY 
IT'S A SUCCESS THAT HAS GIVEN THE CLYDE ITS FIRST REAL TASTE OF OPTIMISM IN DECADES 
THOUGH NOBODY EXPECTS SHIPBUILDING TO REGAIN ITS PRE WAR LEVELS THE ORDER BOOKS ARE NOW BULGING 
AND THIS BIT OF SCOTTISH COAST LOOKS LIKE ITS GOING TO BE BUSY FOR A WHILE YET 
DESPITE THE DECLINE IN SHIPBUILDING THE CONNECTION WITH THE SEA REMAINS STRONG 
THE BIGGEST EMPLOYER ALONG THE WEST COAST IS THE ROYAL NAVY 
HER MAJESTY'S NAVAL BASE HERE AT FASLANE IS THE LARGEST MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT IN SCOTLAND 
IT EMPLOYS A WORKFORCE OF MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND 
THE NAVY'S PRESENCE HERE DATES BACK TO THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
THE DEPTH OF THE LOCHS AND THEIR READY ACCESS TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN 
MAKE THIS AN OBVIOUS CHOICE FOR OUR MOST IMPORTANT SUBMARINE BASE 
AND SINCE THE SIXTIES THAT NO LONGER MEANS JUST TORPEDOES BUT INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES 
EACH OF THESE BOATS IS CAPABLE OF DELIVERING MORE DESTRUCTIVE POWER 
THAN WAS UNLEASHED IN THE WHOLE OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
FASLANE STANDS GUARD OVER BRITAIN'S ENTIRE NUCLEAR ARSENAL 
A FORCE THAT COMPRISES FOUR TRIDENT SUBMARINES 
OUR HISTORIAN NEIL OLIVER HAS BEEN GIVEN PRIVILEGED ACCESS 
TO JOIN THE CREW OF TRIDENT SUBMARINE H. M. S. VANGUARD 
AS WE'RE ESCORTED OUT THE SUBMARINE HAS TO NEGOTIATE THE SHALLOW WATERS OF LOCH GARELOCH 
NAVIGATING A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY METRE LONG SIXTEEN THOUSAND TONNE NUCLEAR SUBMARINE IS NO EASY FEAT 
OVERSEEING THIS TRICKY MANOEUVRE IS CAPTAIN JAKE MOORES 
WE'VE JUST LEFT THE GARELOCH AND COMING DOWN 
THE RHU NARROWS WHERE WE HAVE FORTY YARDS OF CLEAR WATER EITHER SIDE 
AND THIRTY FIVE METRES OF CLEAR WATER UNDERNEATH THE SUBMARINE 
AS THE SUBMARINE IS OVER ONE HUNDRED YARDS LONG 
THERE ISN'T A LOT OF SPACE TO TURN HER AS WE COME THROUGH THE NARROWS AND OUT HERE INTO THE CLYDE 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT FASLANE THAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL 
FASLANE'S IN A UNIQUE POSITION WITHIN THE U. K. 
IT'S A DEEP WATER HARBOUR THAT'S WELL PROTECTED WITH A DIFFICULT NAVIGATIONAL ENTRANCE AND EXIT 
AND ALSO IT PROVIDES EASY ACCESS TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND QUICK ACCESS TO GET OUT TO DEEP WATER 
IN ADDITION THE LOCHS IN THE AREA PROVIDE US WITH DEEP WATER 
WHERE WE CAN CONDUCT TRIALS AND TRAINING WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TOO FAR 
IT'S BEEN OVER THREE YEARS SINCE H. M. S. VANGUARD WAS LAST ON PATROL 
AS THE OLDEST OF THE U. K.'S FOUR TRIDENT SUBMARINES 
SHE WAS TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE IN TWO THOUSAND ONE FOR A COMPLETE OVERHAUL 
BUT BEFORE SHE CAN RESUME PATROL DUTY BOTH THE CREW AND THE SUBMARINE MUST SURVIVE A SERIES OF DRILLS 
I'VE JOINED THE CREW AT THE START OF A GRUELLING SET OF SEA TRIALS 
THAT WILL TEST THE SHIP AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HER MEN TO THE LIMITS 
FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS CAPTAIN MOORES HAS BEEN PREPARING HIS CREW FOR THE FIRST OF THOSE TESTS 
READY TO DIVE DIVING NOW 
THEIR UNDERWATER PATROLS LAST THREE MONTHS DURING WHICH TIME 
NO ONE SEES ANYTHING OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD NOT EVEN DAYLIGHT 
WITH SUCH A VAST ARRAY OF COMPLEX EQUIPMENT A LOT CAN GO WRONG 
AND THE CREW MUST SORT OUT ANY EMERGENCY THEMSELVES BUT THE FEAR THAT HAUNTS EVERY SUBMARINER IS FIRE 
WHICH HUNDREDS OF FEET BELOW THE SURFACE CAN QUICKLY TURN LETHAL 
THREE MEN HAVE BEEN AIRLIFTED FROM A CANADIAN SUBMARINE STRANDED 
LAST YEAR A CREWMAN DIED AND EIGHT OTHERS WERE INJURED ON BOARD THE CANADIAN SUBMARINE 
THE CHICOUTIMI WHEN A FIRE CRIPPLED HER AND LEFT HER ADRIFT IN OPEN SEAS 
NO WONDER THEY TAKE THESE DRILLS IN SUCH DEADLY EARNEST 
TO MAKE SURE THE CREW ARE UP TO SCRATCH 
THE NAVY'S OWN TEAM OF INSPECTORS PLANT A SERIES OF SIMULATED FIRES THROUGHOUT THE SUBMARINE 
ASSESSMENT DAY THERE'S A REAL SENSE OF TENSION RUNNING RIGHT THROUGH THE SHIP IT'S VERY EXCITING 
SHUT BULKHEAD DOORS 
EMERGENCY STATIONS SHUT BULKHEAD DOORS 
GO GO 
AS SOON AS ANY EMERGENCY OCCURS THE OFFICERS' MESS RAPIDLY TRANSFORMS INTO DAMAGE CONTROL 
THE HEADS OF EVERY DEPARTMENT ARE HERE FROM THE CHIEF WEAPONS ENGINEER TO THE CHIEF MEDIC 
DOC ANY INFORMATION ON CASUALTIES 
THIS IS THE NERVE CENTRE DURING ANY CRISIS 
MEANWHILE IT'S THE CREW'S JOB TO TACKLE THE FIRE 
ELECTRICAL FAILURE 
THE PACE OF THE DAY IS RELENTLESS 
WITH ONE FIRE UNDER CONTROL THE TEST TEAM SET OFF OTHERS 
IN SUCH CONFINED SPACES SPEED AND TEAMWORK ARE ESSENTIAL 
THE FIRE IS OUT THE FIRE IS OUT 
THE SUBMARINE WAS STRUCK BY A SUBMERGED CONTAINER 
VARIOUS INCIDENTS HAVE OCCURRED THROUGHOUT THE SUBMARINE INCLUDING TWO FIRES WHICH ARE OUT THAT'S ALL 
ALTHOUGH THE DRILLS AND TESTS ARE NOW OVER THE CREW CAN NEVER RELAX 
IS IT POSSIBLE AT ALL TO GET AWAY FROM THE DAY JOB 
WHILE YOU'RE ON ACTIVE SERVICE I MEAN CAN YOU SWITCH OFF AT ALL 
NO WHILE WE'RE AT SEA YOU CAN'T SWITCH OFF 
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG YOU'RE IN AN ENCLOSED ENVIRONMENT UNDERWATER 
AND YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH IT VERY QUICKLY OTHERWISE THERE COULD BE PROBLEMS 
THAT'S WHY WE TRAIN SO CAREFULLY FOR IT 
WELL THEY'VE PASSED THE FIRST BIG MILESTONE 
BUT FOR THE CREW THIS IS JUST THE START OF A LONG PROCESS 
FOR THEM IT'S MORE PRACTICE MORE ASSESSMENT MORE PRACTICE MORE ASSESSMENTS 
FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS UNTIL THIS SHIP IS FINALLY DECLARED FULLY OPERATIONAL 
THE LOCHS SO PERFECT FOR SUBMARINE TRAINING AND THE TANGLE OF ISLANDS AND INLETS ON THE WEST COAST 
HAVE BEEN THREE THOUSAND MILLION YEARS IN THE MAKING 
EVERYTHING AROUND HERE HAS BEEN SHAPED BY HEAT AND BY ICE 
THESE ANCIENT VOLCANIC ROCKS HAVE BEEN SCOURED INTO DEEP TROUGHS AND MOUNTAINS 
BY THE GLACIERS OF THE LAST ICE AGE IT'S A LANDSCAPE THAT'S CHANGING ALL THE TIME 
WHEN THE ICE MELTED THE WATER FLOODED IN 
SO THOSE AREN'T ISLANDS BUT THE TOPS OF SUBMERGED MOUNTAINS 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO BE MOVED BY THE SHEER SCALE OF THIS PLACE 
AND THE UNBELIEVABLE FORCES THAT FORMED IT 
THE RIVERS OF MOLTEN ROCK THE CATARACTS OF ICE THE TORRENTS OF WATER 
THEY'VE ALL CREATED A NATURAL SPECTACLE THAT JUST CANNOT FAIL TO UNLEASH THE HUMAN IMAGINATION 
THE ISLAND OF STAFFA THROWN UP BY THE SAME VOLCANIC ACTIVITY THAT CREATED THE GIANT'S CAUSEWAY 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND HAS LURED TRAVELLERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
GERMAN COMPOSER FELIX MENDELSSOHN VISITED STAFFA IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY NINE 
THE EXPERIENCE INSPIRED HIS HEBRIDEAN OVERTURE 
FINGAL'S CAVE OVERTURE BY FELIX MENDELSSOHN 
OTHER ARTISTS CAME HERE SIMPLY TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL 
SIXTY YEARS AGO GEORGE ORWELL WENT OUT TO THE REMOTE ISLAND OF JURA TO WRITE HIS CAUSTIC SATIRE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR 
SECLUDED JURA MAY BE BUT TRANQUIL IT IS NOT 
ORWELL'S OWN EXPERIENCES OF JURA INCLUDED A CLOSE CALL 
WITH ONE OF THE COAST'S MOST FEROCIOUS BLACK SPOTS THE GULF OF CORRYVRECKAN 
THE STRETCH OF WATER BETWEEN THE ISLANDS OF JURA AND SCARBA 
IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS IN THE BRITISH ISLES 
WITH CURRENTS REACHING SPEEDS OF UP TO SIXTEEN KNOTS IT WAS ONCE CLASSED AS UN NAVIGABLE BY THE ROYAL NAVY 
ON A QUIET DAY IT CAN BE DECEPTIVELY CALM BUT WHEN TIDES AND WINDS CONSPIRE 
THIS WATER TRANSFORMS INTO ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST FEARSOME SIGHTS 
THE CORRYVRECKAN WHIRLPOOL 
THE WHIRLPOOL'S AWESOME POWER HAS BECOME A DAILY DRAW FOR THRILL SEEKERS 
ARCHAEOLOGIST MARK HORTON DISCOVERS WHAT LIES BENEATH 
SO WHERE ARE WE WE'RE HEADING INTO THE CORRYVRECKAN STRAIGHT AHEAD 
I'VE HITCHED A LIFT WITH LOCAL TOUR BOAT OPERATOR DAVID AINSLEY 
TO FIND OUT WHAT CAUSES THIS MAELSTROM 
WE HAVE JURA ON OUR LEFT HAND SIDE 
TWICE A DAY IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE TIDE EBBING IN AND FLOWING OUT 
THE WHIRLPOOL LIES DORMANT ALLOWING US A BRIEF MOMENT TO GLIMPSE WHAT LIES BENEATH 
A HUGE UNDERWATER MOUNTAIN KNOWN AS THE PINNACLE 
NOW WE'RE SITTING ON TOP OF THE FAMOUS PINNACLE 
THE PINNACLE THAT FUELS ONE OF THE LARGEST WHIRLPOOLS IN THE WORLD 
WE'RE JUST GOING UP OVER THE TOP FIFTY FORTY THAT'S THE PEAK 
WE'RE PRETTY WELL ON TOP OF IT NOW THIS ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY METRE PINNACLE 
TALLER THAN THE BLACKPOOL TOWER 
LIES WAITING IN THE PATH OF THE TIDE 
WHEN THE TIDE FLOODS IN THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER 
SQUEEZING THROUGH THIS NARROW GULF IS DEFLECTED BY THE PINNACLE 
AND IS FORCED DOWN THIS HUGE UNDERWATER MOUNTAINSIDE 
WHERE IT ACCELERATES JUST LIKE A WATERFALL 
BUT THE WATER FLOWING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PINNACLE TRAVELS MUCH SLOWER 
AND IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO CURRENTS THAT CAUSES IT TO SWIRL 
THE ONLY WAY TO SEE THIS PINNACLE IS TO DIVE INTO THE MAELSTROM 
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS DIVES IN BRITAIN 
AND ONE WHICH ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE HAVE UNDERTAKEN 
DAVID AINSLEY IS ONE OF THOSE BRAVE FEW 
IF IT IS SUCH A DANGEROUS DIVE WHY WOULD YOU DIVE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
I THINK DIVERS AND MOUNTAINEERS HAVE VERY MUCH THE SAME UM 
AMBITIONS AND SO ON 
IT'S REGARDED AS ONE OF THE PINNACLES IF YOU LIKE OF DIVING IN BRITAIN BECAUSE IT'S THERE YES 
WHAT'S IT ACTUALLY LIKE DOWN THERE 
THE TIDE HITS THE PINNACLE AT THE END OF THE FLOOD TIDE AND IT ACTUALLY PUSHES UP 
SO YOU HAVE TO HAUL YOURSELF DOWN WITH THE TIDE FLOWING INTO YOUR FACE LIKE A RIVER 
THE BIGGEST RISK IS GETTING TAKEN DOWN IN THE DOWN CURRENTS 
THE TOP OF THE PINNACLE IS AT THIRTY METRES AND IT GOES STRAIGHT DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED METRES 
WHEN THE TIDE TURNS IT'S LIKE AN UNDERWATER WASHING MACHINE DOWN THERE 
ROCKS TRAPPED IN THE SWIRLING WATERS SCOUR OUT HOLLOWS IN THE ROCK FACE 
IT'S CHILLING EVIDENCE OF WHAT A DANGEROUS PLACE THIS IS 
IT'S A BIT LIKE WHEN A TYPHOON PASSES OVERHEAD AND YOU CAN FEEL THE TIDE PULLING YOUR FINS OFF THE ROCKS 
TUGGING YOU DOWNWARDS TO THESE DEPTHS WELL YES 
HOW LONG DOES ONE ACTUALLY DIVE ON THE PINNACLE HALF AN HOUR 
YOU'RE LUCKY IF YOU GET FIVE MINUTES TEN MINUTES MAXIMUM HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN TIME'S UP 
THE END OF THE DIVE IS WHEN THE DOWN CURRENTS START 
SO NORMALLY ON A DIVE YOUR BUBBLES GO UP TO THE SURFACE 
AS YOU'RE DIVING YOU'LL FIND YOUR BUBBLES START STAYING WITH YOU 
THEN THE BUBBLES WILL GO DOWN OVER THE SIDE OF THE CLIFF 
AND WE'VE BEEN THERE LOOKING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE CLIFF WITH OUR BUBBLES GOING DOWN 
AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE OVERSTAYED YOUR WELCOME YOU GET THE HELL OUT YOU GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE 
FOR EVERY DANGER THROWN UP BY THE JAGGED WEST COAST 
THERE ARE JUST AS MANY NATURAL HARBOURS AND SAFE PASSAGES 
AND IT IS THESE SAFE ROUTE WAYS THAT LINK THE ISLANDS RATHER THAN SEPARATE THEM 
ALONG THE WEST COAST THE SEA HOLDS PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES TOGETHER 
AND AT ITS HUB LIES THE PORT OF OBAN 
FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS THIS FISHING TOWN HAS BEEN A TOURIST ATTRACTION IN ITSELF 
BUT FOR MANY TRAVELLERS THEIR VIEW OF THE TOWN IS OFTEN FROM THE FERRY AS IT LEAVES THE TERMINUS 
BECAUSE IT'S SO CLOSE TO THE INNER AND OUTER HEBRIDES 
OBAN CAN JUSTIFIABLY CLAIM TO BE THE GATEWAY TO THE ISLES 
FROM HERE YOU CAN TAKE YOUR PICK OF TWENTY TWO ISLAND DESTINATIONS THAT PEPPER THE WEST COAST 
THOUGH FEW ARE AS RAINBOW COLOURED AS TOBERMORY MORE FAMILIAR TO THE UNDER SIXES AS BALAMORY 
BALAMORY 
WHAT'S THE STORY IN BALAMORY WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW 
I'M DONALD MACLEAN PAINTER AND DECORATOR 
I WAS BORN IN TOBERMORY I'VE LIVED HERE ALL MY LIFE 
CHOOSING OUR COLOURS WITH SPENCER WE SHOULD GO 
BALAMORY WAS FILMED IN TOBERMORY 
IT'S GOT A LOT OF CHARACTERS IN IT 
SPENCER THE PAINTER WHO I'VE BEEN CALLED AFTER A FEW TIMES 
KIDS SHOUTING DAD THERE'S SPENCER 
I TELL THEM SPENCER'S ON HOLIDAY I'M JUST STANDING IN FOR HIM 
THE COLOURS WERE STARTED OFF BY A FORMER PROVOST OF TOBERMORY BOBBY MACLEOD 
HE DECIDED HE WOULD DO ONE BUILDING RED ONE YELLOW AND ONE BLUE 
HE WAS TOLD TO CHANGE IT BACK BUT HE NEVER 
THAT STARTED OFF THE TREND OF ALL THE DIFFERENT COLOURS WHICH I THINK IS VERY NICE 
I'M HAVING MY PIECE NOW WHILE JUNIOR'S DOING THE WORK 
DON'T MISS ANY BITS 
NOT ALL VISITORS HEAD TO MULL FOR THE COLOURFUL SCENERY 
OTHERS ARE DRAWN BY THE SPECTACULAR WILDLIFE 
THE WATERS NORTH OF TOBERMORY UP TOWARDS THE ISLANDS OF EIGG AND RHUM ARE TEEMING WITH MARINE LIFE 
ZOOLOGIST MIRANDA KRESTOVNIKOFF TEAMS UP WITH LOCAL WHALE EXPERT 
BRENNEN FAIRBAIRNS FOR A CLOSE UP VIEW OF THE ELUSIVE MINKE WHALE 
I'VE DONE A BIT OF WHALE WATCHING 
BUT I DIDN'T APPRECIATE WHAT A WHALE WATCHING HOT SPOT THIS IS 
THERE'S A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF SPECIES HERE WE SEE ALMOST A THIRD OF THE WORLD POPULATION 
OF WHALES AND DOLPHINS HERE AROUND THE U. K. COAST AMAZING DIVERSITY 
MORE COMMON ONES WE SEE MINKE WHALES WE SEE LOTS OF DOLPHIN SPECIES 
RISSOS BOTTLE NOSED DOLPHINS COMMON DOLPHINS 
PORPOISES HARBOUR PORPOISES JUST TO NAME A FEW OF THE ONES WE SEE 
AND WHY HERE WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT THIS LOCATION 
THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS REALLY BUT THE MAIN REASON IS THAT WE CATCH THE EDGE OF THE GULF STREAM 
AND THAT BRINGS WARMER RICHER WATER INTO THIS COLDER SEA 
BRINGS IN NUTRIENTS WHICH HELPS TO ACCOUNTS FOR MASSIVE PLANKTON BLOOM EVERY YEAR 
AND THAT BRINGS IN ALL THE PREDATORS UP THE FOOD CHAIN FROM THERE OF COURSE LEADING UP TO THE WHALE 
AND BECAUSE THE WHALES' FOOD COMES IN SO CLOSE TO SHORE 
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THESE FANTASTIC ANIMALS' 
ONE IN FRONT ONE O'CLOCK 
OH YES REALLY CLOSE THERE'S ANOTHER ONE 
MINKE WHALES MIGRATE HERE FROM THE TROPICS TO SPEND THE SUMMER MONTHS FEEDING IN THESE RICH WATERS 
BUT NO ONE REALLY KNOWS IF THEY STAY AROUND THE SCOTTISH COAST ALL SUMMER 
OR IF THEY KEEP MOVING FURTHER NORTH WHERE THEY COULD BE IN DANGER FROM AN ALL TOO FAMILIAR THREAT 
SOME NATIONS STILL HUNT MINKE WHALES WHICH IS THE MAIN WHALE WE SEE 
NORWAY AND ICELAND WHICH HAVE RESUMED WHALING 
AND BECAUSE SO LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT MINKE WHALES 
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE WHALES WE ARE SEEING HERE 
ARE THE SAME ONES THAT ARE BEING KILLED UP OFF THEIR SHORES 
SO REALLY SO MUCH NEEDS TO BE LEARNED ABOUT THESE WHALES REALLY 
IN ORDER TO FIND OUT MORE BRENNEN AND HIS TEAM ARE PHOTOGRAPHING THE WHALES 
SO THEY CAN SPOT ANY MARKINGS WHICH HELP IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS 
THEY'VE COMPILED A CATALOGUE OF THE MINKE WHALES THEY SEE HERE EACH YEAR 
WE'RE TRYING TO BASICALLY GET PHOTO I. D. SHOTS OF THE WHALE 
WE HAVE UPWARDS OF EIGHTY ANIMALS NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN BACK MORE THAN ONE YEAR IN A ROW 
MINKE WHALES BEING THE SMALLEST NOBODY WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THEM 
BUT NOW BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING HUNTED THEY'RE GETTING MORE ATTENTION WHICH IS GOOD 
ANOTHER REASON WE KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT THESE WHALES 
IS BECAUSE THEY'RE FAST AND ELUSIVE WHICH MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW THEM AND GET PHOTOGRAPHS' 
YOU SEE THEM ONCE THEN YOU FOCUS ON THEM AND THEN THEY'RE GONE 
IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT MINKE WHALES 
EXCELLENT THAT'S A GOOD SHOT 
IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH FOR IDENTIFICATION 
YES WE CAN ADD THAT TO OUR CATALOGUE FANTASTIC 
WHAT IS THAT TERRIBLE SMELL 
IT'S MINKE WHALE BREATH REALLY YEAH IT SMELLS LIKE ROTTING FISH 
IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING HOW LITTLE YOU SEE OF THE WHALES FROM THE SURFACE 
SO WE'RE GOING TO USE AN UNDERWATER CAMERA 
SO WE CAN APPRECIATE THE TRUE SIZE AND BEAUTY OF THESE ANIMALS 
AND THE BEST WAY TO FIND WHALES IS TO FIND A SHOAL OF FISH 
STICK WITH THEM AND HOPE A WHALE COMES IN 
I CAN SEE THE FISH YEAH 
YOU CAN JUST START TO SEE THE BAIT BALL HERE THERE'S BIRDS FEEDING HERE 
YOU SEE THE RAZORBILLS AND THE GUILLEMOTS DIVING IN FROM THE SURFACE 
AND THEY SEEM TO BE KEEPING THE FISH TOGETHER IN THAT BIG BALL 
WE'RE EXPECTING A MINKE WHALE TO COME IN AND SCOOP UP THE LOT THAT'D BE GREAT 
IT'S ALMOST THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF BIRDS WORKING COLLECTIVELY TOGETHER 
THERE'S A WHALE COMING IN A WHALE COMING THIS WAY OVER HERE AT NINE O'CLOCK 
YOU GOT THE WHALE THERE MIKE GOT IT GOT IT HERE YEAH 
BEAUTIFUL ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL EXCELLENT REALLY SLEEK 
IT'S HARD TO KEEP UP WITH THEM THEY KEEP SWIMMING THROUGH FRAME REALLY QUICKLY 
WHOA BLIMEY 
I HAVE TO SAY IT'S SPECTACULAR FROM HERE VERY STREAMLINED 
YOU DON'T APPRECIATE WHEN YOU SEE THEM ON THE SURFACE 
JUST HOW STREAMLINE THEY ARE COS YOU SEE SO LITTLE OF THEM 
YEP IT'S COMING CLOSER IT'S COMING RIGHT UNDERNEATH US 
FANTASTIC THIS IS EXCELLENT THAT'S SO CLOSE 
REALLY CLOSE SO HOW LONG IS THIS INDIVIDUAL WE'VE GOT HERE 
PROBABLY ABOUT NINE METRES 
AND HOW HEAVY PROBABLY ABOUT TEN TONS 
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE THEM UNDERWATER BECAUSE YOU DON'T APPRECIATE 
WHAT SIZE OR SHAPE THEY ARE WHEN YOU SEE JUST A DORSAL FIN 
IT'S GREAT TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN SEE THESE WHALES AND DOLPHINS AROUND OUR COASTLINE 
BUT ONCE THEY LEAVE THE SAFETY OF THESE SHORES 
THEY COULD BECOME PART OF THE ONE THOUSAND MINKE WHALES KILLED THROUGH HUNTING EACH YEAR 
THIS MAKES BRENNEN'S RESEARCH WORK EVEN MORE INVALUABLE 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THE KNOYDART PENINSULA 
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE ROAD OR RAIL TRACK THE WHOLE WAY FROM LOCH HOURN UP HERE 
TO LOCH NEVIS DOWN HERE 
IT'S KNOWN AS SCOTLAND'S LAST WILDERNESS 
THE PLACE PERFECT FOR A QUIET LIFE 
MY NAME IS FRANCIS CORMEY NORMALLY CALLED FRANK OR FRANKIE 
AND I LOOK AFTER THIS CHURCH WHICH IS A BACKPACKER'S PLACE 
AND WHAT I'M DOING NOW IS MAKING THESE BLOODY STICKS 
AND I SELL THEM TO THE TOURISTS 
I DON'T LIKE DOING THAT 
I'D SOONER MAKE A STICK FOR SOMEBODY WHO WANTS A STICK ACTUALLY FOR NOTHING 
ONE OF THESE PHIL PHILA 
WELL THAT LONG WORD THAT MEANS A KINDLY SOUL 
I'VE JUST SAWED A HOLE IN MY TROUSERS 
THERE IT'S THERE YOU SEE IT 
OH IT'S IT'S FALLEN OFF 
OCH I SWEAR A LOT I ENJOY SWEARING ACTUALLY 
THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CEILIDHS IN THE CHURCH 
I'VE GOT A LITTLE HOUSE AT THE END THERE WITH A DOUBLE BED UPSTAIRS 
JUST IN CASE BY CHANCE I GET LUCKY 
IT'S A SPECIAL PLACE THIS YOU WON'T GET MANY MANY PLACES IN SCOTLAND NOW 
THAT'S LIKE THIS PLACE I ACTUALLY LOVE IT UP HERE 
BUT IT 
FORTY YEARS AGO I WOULDN'T HAVE CONTEMPLATED STAYING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS 
YOU HAVE TO WANDER A BIT IT'S LIKE THAT FILM THE WANDERING STARS THING 
MY WANDERING STARS LANDED HERE 
FOR CENTURIES HUGE SWATHES OF SCOTLAND 
WERE AS ISOLATED AND AS INACCESSIBLE AS KNOYDART 
AND MUCH OF THE WESTERN COAST WAS CONSIDERED TO BE FIRMLY BEYOND THE PALE 
NOT ONLY WERE ITS CRAGGY ISLANDS DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS TO REACH 
BUT THEY WERE POPULATED BY VIOLENT WARRIOR CLANS 
THIS WAS THE DOMAIN OF THE LORDS OF THE ISLES 
CLAN CHIEFS WHO THUMBED THEIR NOSE AT THE KING IN EDINBURGH 
THE LORDS PROTECTED THEIR REALM FROM CASTLES BUILT IN KEY STRATEGIC COASTAL LOCATIONS 
SAFE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT CONTROL OF THE WATERWAYS MADE THEM IMPREGNABLE 
BUT IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THE SCOTTISH KING JAMES V. 
DECIDED THAT IT WAS TIME TO BRING THESE REBELLIOUS LORDS TO HEEL 
I'VE COME TO EILEAN DONAN CASTLE TO LEARN WHY IT WAS SO HARD 
FOR THE SCOTTISH MONARCH TO DISLODGE THE LORDS OF THE ISLES 
IT'S CURIOUS IN THIS DAY AND AGE TO THINK OF A MONARCH WHO WASN'T IN CONTROL OF HIS OWN LAND 
VERY MUCH THIS WAS PART OF JAMES' BACK YARD AND HE DIDN'T RUN IT 
THE LORDS OF THE ISLES RAN IT 
THE MACDONALDS AND THE MACLEODS ON THE ISLE OF SKYE 
THE MACLEANS DOWN TOWARDS DUART AND ALL THESE CLANS HELD THEIR OWN TERRITORIES FIERCELY AUTONOMOUS 
IN TOTAL CONTEMPT OF KING JAMES OR ANY OTHER MONARCH FOR THAT MATTER THIS WAS THEIR LAND 
AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN TOO IMPRESSED WITH A MONARCH 
SEEMING TO WANT TO RULE OR GOVERN THEM 
THE KING WAS KEPT AT BAY BY TWO HUNDRED MILES OF ALMOST IMPASSABLE TERRAIN SEPARATING THE ISLES FROM EDINBURGH 
TO AN OUTSIDER THIS IS PRETTY FORMIDABLE GEOGRAPHY 
HOW DID THE LORDS USE THIS TO THEIR ADVANTAGE SIMPLY BY USING THE SEA 
THE SEA IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE CLAN CULTURE BECAUSE THESE SEA LOCHS 
THESE FJORDS ARE THE MARINE MOTORWAYS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD 
YOU MUST COMMAND THE SEA THE SEA IS THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE LORDS OF THE ISLES 
THE KING WAS TOTALLY DISADVANTAGED 
HE COULDN'T MARCH TO THE WESTERN ISLES SO ANY PUNITIVE RAID WOULD HAVE TO BE BY SEA 
FINE BUT HOW ON EARTH WOULD HE FIND HIS WAY THROUGH THE LETHAL LABYRINTH THAT WAS THE WEST COAST 
THERE WERE NO ACCURATE MAPS 
UNDAUNTED HE DECIDED TO COMPILE ONE OF HIS OWN 
A ROUTE MAP TO THE BACK DOOR OF HIS OWN KINGDOM 
AUTHORED BY HIS FOREMOST NAVIGATOR ALEXANDER LINDSAY 
THE DOCUMENT GAVE JAMES HIS OWN DEFINITIVE ROUTER OR RUTTER AS IT BECAME KNOWN 
INFORMATION REALLY WAS POWER 
SUCH A PLAN SUCH A ROUTE WOULD BE A PRIZED PIECE OF INFORMATION 
NOT ALL THE LORDS OF THE ISLES KNEW OF THE DETAILS OF EVERYONE ELSE'S TERRITORY 
BUT TO KNIT IT ALL TOGETHER THE COMPLETE INTELLIGENCE OF THE WEST HIGHLANDS 
WAS A POWERFUL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT A POWERFUL DOCUMENT 
ARMED WITH THE RUTTER AND A FLEET OF WARSHIPS JAMES WAS READY FOR BATTLE 
HAVING ROUNDED THE EAST AND NORTH COASTS JAMES ADVANCED INTO THE VERY HEART OF CLAN TERRITORY 
TO DUNVEGAN WHERE HE CAPTURED THE CHIEF OF CLAN MACLEOD 
NEXT STOP MULL AND ISLAY 
STRONGHOLDS OF THE MACLEANS AND MACDONALDS 
IT WAS HERE THE RUTTER REALLY PROVED ITS WORTH 
DIRECTING THE FLEET TO A VITAL SHORT CUT 
FROM BURNT ILAND TO KILARK 
SOUTH EAST TO SOUTH FIVE MILE 
KILARK IS A NARROW PASSAGE 
AND BETWIXT IT AND KYILRA IS A GOOD ROUTE 
NO ONE KNOWS BETTER THAN LOCAL SAILOR DAVID CROY 
HOW POWERFUL A TOOL THE RUTTER WOULD HAVE BEEN 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN AGE BEFORE G. P. S. OR ADMIRALTY CHARTS 
THEY'D HAVE BEEN NAVIGATING IN THOSE DAYS BY FOLLOWING SHORE FEATURES 
THE INTERESTING THING IS WE CAME DOWN ON THE BEARING OF SOUTH EAST 
YOU JUST COULD NOT SEE THE KYLEAKIN ENTRANCE IT WASN'T VISIBLE WAS IT 
THE OTHER THING IS YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF WHAT YOU THINK COULD BE AN ENTRANCE 
AND CERTAINLY OVER HERE JUST BEHIND THE SAIL THAT COULD LOOK LIKE THE KYLEAKIN ENTRANCE 
IT'S EASY FOR US NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SKYE BRIDGE TELLING US WHERE TO GO 
BUT IF YOU TAKE THE SKYE BRIDGE OUT OF THE SHORELINE YOU CAN'T SEE THAT WAY THROUGH 
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE THE DARK FLANK OF THE MOUNTAIN 
THE RUTTER ALSO GAVE JAMES VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT DANGEROUS TIDES AND SHALLOW CHANNELS 
WITHOUT THIS KNOWLEDGE HIS WARSHIPS COULD EASILY HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES STRANDED IN HOSTILE WATERS' 
IF YE WILL LIE BETWIXT THE BRUNT ISLANDS AND KYLARK 
HOLD THE EAST SIDE AND YE SHALL FIND EIGHTY FATHOMS 
KYLE RHEA IS A NARROW PASSAGE IN WHICH IS A DANGEROUS TIDE 
HOW DID THOSE HIGH AND LOW TIDES AFFECT PASSAGE UP AND DOWN THIS TRICKY COAST 
WELL ONE OF THE THINGS IS WE'VE GOT A MASSIVE BODY OF WATER 
THAT'S WANTING TO GET THROUGH QUITE A NARROW CHANNEL HERE WHICH CAUSES BIG TIDES 
IF WE WERE ROWING FORWARD AT SAY THREE KNOTS WITH FOUR KNOTS OF TIDE GOING AGAINST US IT WOULD BE 
WELL WE'D GO FORWARD THREE BUT BACK FOUR 
SO YOU'RE LOSING GROUND BECAUSE YOU GOT THE TIDE WRONG YEAH 
SO JAMES COMING DOWN HERE WITH HIS ARMADA OF MUCH BIGGER SHIPS THAN THIS 
WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO KNOW JUST WHEN TO TRY TO DO THAT 
BECAUSE TO GET IT WRONG HE'D JUST RUN THOSE SHIPS ON TO ROCKS RIGHT 
IT WAS ALL OVER FOR THE CLANS 
WITH THEIR INACCESSIBLE ISLAND BASES PENETRATED 
THEY WERE EASY MEAT FOR JAMES WHO DRAGGED THE MOST TROUBLESOME CLAN CHIEFS BACK TO EDINBURGH 
WHERE HE HELD THEM THERE AS HOSTAGES TILL HIS DEATH IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY TWO 
THE LASTING IMPACT OF LINDSAY'S RUTTER AND JAMES' EXPEDITION 
IS THAT THE WESTERN ISLES WERE OPENED UP TO THE REST OF SCOTLAND 
NO LONGER SEPARATE FIEFDOMS NO LONGER BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE CROWN 
BACK IN EDINBURGH JAMES ADDED INSULT TO INJURY 
BY CLAIMING THE TITLE LORD OF THE ISLES FOR HIMSELF AND FOR THE MONARCHY 
SO THE CURRENT LORD OF THE ISLES IS NO WEST COAST CHIEFTAIN BUT PRINCE CHARLES 
ROYALTY HAS ALWAYS HAD A STRONG CONNECTION WITH THE HIGHLANDS 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE MOUNTAINEER SIR HUGH MUNRO CATALOGUED EVERY PEAK OVER THREE THOUSAND FEET FOR QUEEN VICTORIA 
I'M SURE SHE HAD NO INTENTION OF CLIMBING ALL OF THEM 
THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR TWELVE OF THEM HERE ON SKYE 
AND THE PRACTICE OF CLIMBING THEM ONE BY ONE AND KEEPING A LIST IS CALLED MUNRO BAGGING 
IT'S A BIT LIKE TRAIN SPOTTING ONLY WETTER AND COLDER AND A BIT MORE EXERTING 
THE PERSON WHO INTRODUCED ME TO THE MOUNTAINS WAS MY DAD 
HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO USE A MAP AND A COMPASS 
AND I'VE BEEN CLIMBING AND WALKING IN PLACES LIKE THIS EVER SINCE 
FROM HERE ON SKYE WE'RE TRAVELLING FURTHER WEST TO THE OUTER HEBRIDES 
THE TINY ISLAND OF BARRA IS THE ONLY PLACE IN THE WORLD 
TO USE ITS BEACH AS A RUNWAY FOR SCHEDULED AIRLINE FLIGHTS 
THE KIND OF AIRLINE FOOD YOU'LL GET HERE IS SLIGHTLY MORE UNUSUAL 
THE MENU AT BARRA'S CASTLEBAY HOTEL INCLUDES COCKLES FROM THE AIRPORT 
COLLECTED FROM THE BEACH BY LOCAL BOY ANGUS JOHN 
I'M ANGUS JOHN MACLEOD AND I'M FROM THE ISLE OF BARRA 
THAT'S THE SERVICE PLANE IT LANDS OVER THERE 
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS WHOLE PLACE UNIQUE YOU KNOW 
A SERVICE PLANE ACTUALLY LANDS HERE IT'S A CORNED BEEF CAN WITH WINGS I CAN'T STAND FLYING ON IT 
PUTTING A RAKE IN THE GROUND AND TAKING OUT COCKLES AND PUTTING IT INTO A BUCKET'S NOT EXCITING 
BUT AT LEAST YOU'RE IN THE FRESH AIR YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING 
IT'S AN HONEST DAY'S WORK ALL YOU DO IS PUT THE RAKE IN 
PULL IT OUT AND TRY AND GET THEM OUT FROM UNDER IT YOU KNOW 
AND THEN ONCE THEY GET ABOVE IT JUST PICK THEM UP AND CHUCK THEM IN THE BUCKET 
THAT'S MY GRANDFATHER CALLUM 
HE'S SEVENTY FIVE THIS YEAR AND THE GUY STILL WORKS LIKE A TROJAN 
HE'S A MACHINE I'M SURE OF IT 
EVEN MY DAD AND HE'S A FIT FELLA HE'LL NOT KEEP UP WITH HIM 
THERE'S NOT MANY PEOPLE THAT CAN I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DOES IT 
THE COCKLES THAT WE HAVE PICKED WILL GET TAKEN TO MAINLAND EUROPE 
DOWN TO FRANCE AND DOWN TO SPAIN 
THERE'S A GOOD FEW TONNES GO OUT OF HERE EVERY WEEK 
SO THEY MUST BE PRETTY FOND OF THEIR COCKLES DOWN IN PORTUGAL 
I DON'T LIKE COCKLES MY MUM AND DAD LIKE THEM 
MY DAD WILL SOMETIMES TAKE A BUCKET HOME 
EITHER CURRY THEM OR COOK THEM IN GARLIC BUTTER YOU KNOW 
THAT'S WHEN I SHOOT OUT THE HOUSE I DON'T LIKE THEM AT ALL 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS FOR THE WESTERN ISLES IS THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE LEAVING THE ISLANDS 
DURING THE LAST FORTY YEARS THE POPULATION HAS DROPPED BY A FIFTH 
AND TWELVE ISLANDS HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY ABANDONED 
SCARP AROUND SIXTY MILES NORTH OF BARRA 
IS THE MOST RECENTLY DESERTED ISLAND 
IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES IT WITNESSED AN INGENIOUS ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION 
AN EXPERIMENT IN AIR MAIL THAT WAS TO MAKE HISTORY 
NOT WITH AIRCRAFT BUT BY ROCKET 
THE GERMAN INVENTOR HERR ZUCKER VISUALISES A CROSS CHANNEL ROCKET MAIL SERVICE 
ONE TWO THREE 
AND NOW SEVENTY YEARS LATER WE'LL TRY TO RE CREATE AN AUDACIOUS PLAN 
TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THOSE ISLANDS 
AND JOINING ME ON THIS MISSION IS MARK HORTON 
BACK IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES SCARP WAS HOME TO A THRIVING COMMUNITY 
WHO SURVIVED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CROFTING THE LAND AND FISHING THE LOCAL SEAS 
THEN THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEM FACING THE ISLANDERS WAS MAINTAINING A LINK WITH NEARBY HARRIS MAINLAND 
ON A CLEAR CALM DAY THE JOURNEY IS JUST A SHORT BOAT TRIP AND TAKES LITTLE MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES 
BUT WHEN THE WEATHER IS BAD THIS WATERWAY MIGHT AS WELL BE A HUNDRED MILES WIDE 
BECOMING COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSS 
ONE PERSON WHO KNOWS ONLY TOO WELL THE DIFFICULTIES OF LIVING ON SCARP 
IS DONALD JOHN MACINNES WHOSE FAMILY WAS ONE OF THE LAST TO LEAVE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE 
HARRIS DOESN'T SEEM PARTICULARLY FAR OFF 
NO IT DOESN'T JUST ON OUR DOORSTEP 
BUT DECEPTIVELY FAR THOUGH WHEN YOU HAVE TO GET ACROSS 
IN QUITE TOUGH TIDES AND ROUGH WEATHER 
WE'RE RIGHT OUT IN THE ATLANTIC HERE 
YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFICULTIES WHEN YOU LOOK ON THINGS LIKE THE SCHOOL REGISTER FOR INSTANCE 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ENTRY FROM DECEMBER FOURTEENTH NINETEEN SEVENTEEN 
ONLY TODAY DID A FEW MEN VENTURE TO TAKE A BOAT TO HUSHINISH AND THENCE TO AMHUINNSUIDHE 
BUT IT WAS A RISK AND FAR TOO STORMY FOR WOMEN TO VENTURE 
THEY HAVE JUST RETURNED TO HUSHINISH BUT CAN'T GET HOME 
SUCH IS SCARP 
AND THAT'S THE STORY OF IT SO NEAR AND YET SO FAR 
THE PROBLEMS OF GETTING TO AND FROM THE ISLAND 
WERE TO BRING SCARP SPECTACULARLY TO THE INTERNATIONAL LIMELIGHT 
IN JANUARY NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR CHRISTINA MACLENNAN WAS EXPECTING TWINS 
THE FIRST BABY A GIRL MARY ARRIVED ON THE THIRTEENTH 
THE SECOND BIRTH RAN INTO TROUBLE AND BECAUSE OF APPALLING WEATHER 
THE DOCTOR COULD NOT BE REACHED ON THE MAINLAND 
CHRISTINA AND HER UNBORN BABY WERE IN DANGER 
SO STILL IN LABOUR SHE WAS TRANSPORTED BY BOAT AND BUS TO STORNOWAY 
THE TWINS MARY AND JESSIE WERE BORN TWO DAYS AND FIFTY MILES APART ON SEPARATE ISLANDS 
THIS NEAR TRAGEDY SHOWED COMMUNICATION HAD TO BE MADE MORE RELIABLE 
THE DRAMATIC STORY REACHED TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD GERMAN INVENTOR GERHARD ZUCKER 
HE THOUGHT HE HAD THE ANSWER ROCKETS 
SO HE SOLD THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POST OFFICE ON HIS VISION OF A ROCKET MAIL SERVICE 
THAT COULD DELIVER LETTERS AND FOOD AND EVEN MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO ISOLATED COMMUNITIES LIKE SCARP 
THE AUTHORITIES WERE INTRIGUED AND THEY INVITED HIM UP HERE TO SHOW THEM WHAT HE COULD DO 
BY JULY HE WAS IN TARBERT PREPARING FOR HIS BIG EXPERIMENT 
ZUCKER'S PLAN WAS TO FIRE HIS MAIL ROCKET FROM SCARP 
ACROSS THE HALF MILE STRETCH OF WATER AND HOPEFULLY LAND ON HARRIS 
TO APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGE FACED BY ZUCKER 
WE'RE GOING TO RECREATE HIS EXPERIMENT 
USING SURVIVING BLUEPRINTS HELD BY THE POST OFFICE MUSEUM 
OUR MODERN ROCKETEER JOHN BONSOR GIVES MARK HORTON A CRASH COURSE IN ROCKET SCIENCE 
JOHN THIS IS WHAT A ROCKET REALLY SHOULD LOOK LIKE 
I MEAN IT'S STRAIGHT OUT OF FLASH GORDON OR JULES VERNE 
YES IT'S VERY MUCH A NINETEEN TWENTIES NINETEEN THIRTIES CLASSICAL ROCKET DESIGN 
SO HOW HEAVY IS IT 
FOUR KILOGRAMS INCLUDING THE MAIL THE MAIL'S IN THE FRONT HERE 
IT'S IN THREE COMPARTMENTS AT THE FRONT SO THE MAIL'S IN THERE 
TO GET THIS MAIL IN THE AIR IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT 
THAT'S WHY WE NEED SO MANY MOTORS LARGE ONE IN THE CORE THAT'S THE MAIN MOTOR 
AND THEN THE EIGHT SMALLER ENGINES TAKE OVER WHEN THE MAIN ONE STARTS TO RUN OUT OF THRUST 
TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE RANGE DO YOU THINK IT WILL WORK I BELIEVE IT WILL 
TWENTY EIGHTH JULY NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR LAUNCH DAY HAD ARRIVED ON SCARP 
IT WAS A MOMENTOUS OCCASION AND THE TINY ISLAND BUZZED WITH V. I. P.'S AND DIGNITARIES 
WHO HAD TRAVELLED FROM AS FAR AFIELD AS LONDON TO WITNESS THE GREAT POSTAL EXPERIMENT 
ALSO THERE ON THE DAY WAS FOURTEEN YEAR OLD JOHN ANGUS MACLEOD 
WHAT WAS THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE HERE ON THE DAY OF THE LAUNCH 
WELL NOWADAYS I WOULD PROBABLY SAY IT WAS ELECTRIC 
THOUGH WE DIDN'T HAVE ELECTRICITY ON THE ISLAND THEN 
GIVEN THAT YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE A ROCKET FIRED WELL MORE OR LESS AT YOU 
WAS ANYBODY WORRIED ABOUT WHERE IT WOULD LAND 
WELL I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED MYSELF 
COULD HE GET IT STRAIGHT ON TO THAT BEACH OVER THERE 
THAT'S WHERE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO LAND MAKE A SOFT LANDING 
SO IT WAS JUST TO MAKE A SMOOTH CURVE ACROSS TO THAT BEACH THERE YES TO THAT BEACH THERE 
TO PROVE ITS WORTH AS A POSTAL MISSILE ZUCKER PACKED THE ROCKET WITH ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED LETTERS 
AND FOR THE BIG DAY HE HAD PERSUADED THE POST OFFICE TO ISSUE SPECIAL ROCKET MAIL COMMEMORATIVE STAMPS 
BECAUSE HE FIGURED THAT STAMP COLLECTORS WOULD PAY A SMALL FORTUNE 
FOR A LETTER THAT HAD BEEN DELIVERED BY A ROCKET 
THIS IS ONE OF THE ACTUAL LETTERS THAT WENT IN THAT NOSE CONE 
COMPLETE WITH THE ORIGINAL STAMP 
THERE WAS INTEREST IN THIS FROM ALL OVER BRITAIN 
SO ZUCKER'S PLAN WAS BEAUTIFUL AND SIMPLE 
SEND THE ROCKET OVER HAVE THE LETTERS GO ON THEIR WAY 
SO IN ONE STROKE HE WOULD SHOW THAT ROCKET MAIL WORKED 
AND TURN A PROFIT FOR HIMSELF ON THE SIDE 
BUT THE SINGEING ON THE ENVELOPE TELLS ITS OWN STORY 
ONE TWO THREE 
IT HAD TAKEN ZUCKER TWO YEARS OF HARD WORK TO DESIGN AND BUILD HIS ROCKET 
BUT IT WAS ALL OVER IN A MATTER OF SECONDS 
THE ROCKET DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT OFF THE RAMP 
IT EXPLODED BLASTING THE MAIL ALL OVER THE ISLAND LIKE CONFETTI 
LATER IT WAS RECOVERED BY THE POSTMASTER AND ULTIMATELY DELIVERED BY MORE CONVENTIONAL MEANS 
NOT ALLOWED TO IMPORT HIS USUAL ROCKET FUEL FROM GERMANY 
ZUCKER HAD BEEN FORCED TO USE FIREWORK GUNPOWDER WHICH WAS FAR TOO VOLATILE 
THE RESULT WAS IT EXPLODED 
BUT WAS THE DESIGN ALSO AT FAULT 
OUR MODERN ROCKETEERS PUT IT TO THE TEST 
THIS TIME USING A MUCH MORE STABLE PROPELLANT 
O. K. NEIL WE'RE PREPARING FOR LAUNCH O. K. MARK GOOD LUCK 
THANKS 
FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE 
LAUNCH 
MARK I'VE FOUND IT FANTASTIC 
I'M JUST GOING TO LOOK AT IT IT SEEMS INTACT THOUGH 
OUR ROCKET FLEW AT OVER TWO HUNDRED M. P. H. 
AND EASILY COVERED THE HALF MILE DISTANCE BETWEEN SCARP AND HARRIS' 
LOOKS LIKE A PROP FROM DAN DARE 
HI NEIL MARK WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IT'S ALL THERE ALL IN ONE PIECE 
THREE TWO ONE 
LAUNCH 
ALTHOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING STRAIGHT OUT OF A COMIC BOOK 
ZUCKER'S ROCKET DESIGN ACTUALLY WORKS 
YOU'RE A GENIUS JOHN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED I THINK 
BUT FOR POOR ZUCKER THINGS ONLY GOT WORSE 
ON RETURNING TO GERMANY HE WAS PROMPTLY IMPRISONED 
FOR SMUGGLING WEAPON TECHNOLOGY OUT OF THE REICH 
BECAUSE WHILE HE'D BEEN AWAY DEVELOPING PEACEFUL USES FOR THE TECHNOLOGY 
THE NAZIS HAD BEEN AT WORK ON A TOP SECRET ROCKET PROGRAMME 
THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY DELIVER THE INFAMOUS V. ONE AND V. TWO ROCKETS 
THAT WOULD BRING SUCH TERROR TO THE SKIES OVER LONDON 
AFTER THE WAR ZUCKER EVER THE SHOWMAN KEPT PLUGGING AWAY 
BUT BY NOW HE WAS JUST A SIDESHOW EARNING A FEW QUID 
FIRING ROCKET MAIL BEARING HIS OWN COMMEMORATIVE STAMPS 
WE'RE COMING TO THE END OF OUR ISLAND HOPPING JOURNEY ALONG THE WEST COAST 
THAT FIFTY M. FANG OF ROCK THERE IS CALLED THE OLD MAN OF STORR 
AND IT'S A MEASURE OF HOW REMOTE THIS REGION IS 
THAT IT WASN'T CLIMBED UNTIL NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE 
TWO YEARS AFTER SHERPA TENZING AND EDMUND HILARY FIRST CLIMBED MOUNT EVEREST 
I'VE BEEN COMING TO THESE MOUNTAINS SINCE I WAS A TEENAGER AND I'M DRAWN BACK YEAR AFTER YEAR 
BY THE SPACE THE ISOLATION AND THE THEATRICAL BEAUTY OF THESE MOUNTAINS ABOVE THE SEA 
FROM HERE WE'RE HEADING BACK TO THE MAINLAND OVER THERE 
FOR THE NEXT LEG OF OUR JOURNEY ALONG THE NORTH COAST OF SCOTLAND WHERE LIFE GETS EVEN TOUGHER 
WE'LL BE EXPLORING LIFE ON THE EDGE FROM CAPE WRATH TO DUNNETT HEAD 
ALONG THE WAY WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE NOTORIOUS HIGHLAND CLEARANCES 
WE LOOK AT THE LEGACY OF BRITAIN'S EXPERIMENTAL NUCLEAR POWER STATION DOUNREAY 
AND WE SEE HOW THE COASTGUARD COPES WITH BATTLING EXTREME ELEMENTS 
ON THIS REMOTE AND ISOLATED STRETCH OF COAST 
THE TARGETS CHANGE THE TERROR DOES NOT 
THE BLOODY HISTORY OF FORTY YEARS OF TERRORISM
