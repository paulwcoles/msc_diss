HELLO AND WELCOME TO GCSE BITESIZE 
A SERIES DESIGNED TO GIVE YOU THE EDGE WHEN SITTING YOUR GCSES 
THIS IS THE FIRST OF TWO PROGRAMMES 
DESIGNED TO IMPROVE YOUR KNOWLEDGE 
AND CONFIDENCE FOR YOUR DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY GCSE 
THE PROGRAMMES WORK TOGETHER AND YOU'LL NEED TO WATCH THEM BOTH 
FOR THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED FOR YOUR OWN OPTION 
THIS IS IS D. AND AMP T. ONE 
ONCE YOU'VE RECORDED THE PROGRAMMES YOU CAN EITHER PLAY THEM BACK 
IN BITESIZE CHUNKS OR IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GO FOR IT 
YOU COULD SIT DOWN AND TACKLE THEM IN ONE GO 
THE PROGRAMMES STAND ALONE SO YOU'LL GET SOME REALLY USEFUL INFORMATION FROM THEM 
THERE'S ALSO A BOOK AND IF YOU GO TO OUR WEBSITE 
YOU'LL FIND THE KEY CONTENT FOR YOUR SYLLABUS 
QUESTIONS TO PRACTISE AND ANIMATIONS TO HELP WITH DIFFICULT CONCEPTS 
THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME WE'LL GIVE YOU EXERCISES TO DO 
JUST PAUSE THE PROGRAMME WHEN YOU SEE THIS SIGN 
AND FINALLY WATCH OUT FOR OUR CHECKLISTS WHICH WILL GIVE YOU A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH 
TO HELP YOU IMPROVE YOUR GRADE 
IN DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY ALL THE FOCUS AREAS ARE ASSESSED ON TWO FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS 
YOU'LL BE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND AND APPLY BOTH THESE VITAL SKILLS 
WHETHER YOU'RE MAKING A CAKE BUILDING AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT 
OR ANSWERING A QUESTION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY IN YOUR EXAM 
YOUR COURSEWORK ACCOUNTS FOR THE LARGEST CHUNK OF THE MARK SIXTY PER CENT 
AND YOUR MARK DEPENDS ON HOW WELL YOU CAN DESIGN AND MAKE A PRODUCT 
A WRITTEN EXAM MAKES UP THE REST OF THE MARKS 
AND YOU'LL BE TESTED ON YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING 
OF THE DESIGNING AND MAKING PROCESS 
THIS FIRST PROGRAMME WILL START BY TAKING YOU THROUGH 
THE PROCESSES YOU NEED TO DESIGN AND MAKE ANY PRODUCT EFFECTIVELY 
YOU NEED THESE SKILLS NO MATTER WHAT OPTION YOU'RE STUDYING 
IF YOU'RE DOING THE PRODUCT DESIGN OPTION 
THEN THIS IS ESSENTIAL VIEWING AS ARE ALL THE SECTIONS OF PROGRAMMES ONE AND TWO 
THE SECOND PART OF THE PROGRAMME WILL ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING NEEDED 
FOR THE FOCUS AREAS GRAPHIC PRODUCTS AND FOOD TECHNOLOGY 
PROGRAMME TWO WILL GO ON TO LOOK AT THE FOCUS AREAS 
RESISTANT MATERIALS 
ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS AND CONTROL 
AND TEXTILE TECHNOLOGY 
THE PROGRAMMES WORK TOGETHER AND YOU'LL GAIN MARKS IF YOU CAN SHOW A BROAD AWARENESS 
OF ALL THE FOCUS AREAS 
SO WHICHEVER FOCUS AREA YOU'RE STUDYING KEEP WATCHING BECAUSE OUR CASE STUDIES 
OFFER REAL LIFE SOLUTIONS TO DESIGN CHALLENGES 
AND HERE'S A TASTE OF WHAT'S COMING UP 
SO LET'S GET GOING 
YOU MIGHT KNOW A LOT ABOUT YOUR CHOSEN FOCUS AREA 
BUT YOU MUST COMBINE THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH SOLID UNDERSTANDING 
OF THE DESIGNING AND MAKING PROCESS 
AND WHETHER IT'S A SOUFFLE OR A BICYCLE 
THIS PROCESS STAYS THE SAME 
THE KEY TO THE FIRST PART OF THE PROCESS 
IS TO DRAW UP A DETAILED BRIEF AND SPECIFICATION 
WHEN YOU SET ABOUT DECIDING ON A BRIEF FOR YOUR COURSEWORK PROJECT 
THE REAL MARKS TO BE WON ARE WHEN YOU DESIGN TO A GENUINE NEED 
YOUR BRIEF IS YOUR STATEMENT OF INTENT WHAT YOU AIM TO DO 
IT SHOULD BE CONCISE AND SET THE SCENE 
AND IT SHOULD NEVER DESCRIBE THE OUTCOME 
YOUR SPECIFICATION GOES ON TO DESCRIBE ALL THE THINGS THAT THE FINAL PRODUCT 
MUST BE ABLE TO DO OR BE 
IN YOUR EXAM YOU'RE OFTEN ASKED TO THINK ABOUT KEY CONSIDERATIONS 
FOR YOUR SPECIFICATION YOU SHOULD CONSIDER 
THE CONTEXT WHERE AND HOW THE PRODUCT WILL BE USED 
AND HOW WILL THIS EFFECT THE MATERIALS YOU SELECT 
THE PRIMARY FUNCTION HOW WILL IT WORK AND WHY 
SECONDARY FUNCTIONS SUCH AS QUALITY RELIABILITY AND SAFETY 
AESTHETICS SUCH AS SIZE AND SHAPE AS WELL AS GENERAL STYLING 
LIKE THE FEEL COLOUR OR TEXTURE 
AND FINALLY THE SCALE OF PRODUCTION 
THERE ARE FIVE TYPES 
ONE OFF WHEN ITEMS ARE INDIVIDUALLY PRODUCED LIMITED EDITIONS 
WHEN A SET QUANTITY AND NO MORE ARE PRODUCED 
BATCH PRODUCTION WHEN A SMALL NUMBER OF IDENTICAL ITEMS ARE MADE 
REPETITIVE BATCH WHERE PRODUCTION RUNS ARE REPEATED AS NEEDED 
FOR EXAMPLE WITH SEASONAL PRODUCTS 
AND CONTINUOUS MASS PRODUCTION 
WHEN THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS ARE MADE ALL YEAR ROUND 
WHATEVER THE SCALE OF PRODUCTION 
THERE ALWAYS NEEDS TO BE A DESIGN BRIEF AND SPECIFICATION 
HERE'S A BRIEF FOR THE NEW PERSIL TRAVEL PACK 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME AND NOTE DOWN THIS BRIEF 
NOW WATCH THIS CLIP ON THE PERSIL TRAVEL PACK 
THEN STOP THE PROGRAMME AND WRITE A DESIGN SPECIFICATION FOR IT 
I THINK AT THIS STAGE WE SHOULD TRY AND KEEP THE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AS WIDE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN 
THE CONSUMERS VERY QUICKLY WILL SIFT OUT THE KEY POINTS TONIGHT 
IF WE LOOK AT THE LAUNDRY PART THE WASHING PART OF IT WE HAVE A LIQUID OR A POWDER ALTERNATIVE 
THERE'S PLUSES AND MINUSES TO THOSE 
SECURITY OF OPENING AND CLOSING IS VITAL YOU LOOK AT THINGS WITH A SCREW TOP NOT JUST A FLIP 
WHICH IS GOING TO LEAK IN TRANSIT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FACTOR WHEN MAKING A PURCHASE DECISION 
ALSO THE STRENGTH OF THE PACK ITSELF SO IF YOU SQUASH THINGS ON TOP OF IT 
IT'S NOT JUST THE CLOSING IT'S THE WHOLE PACK THAT I'D FEEL HAPPY TAKING 
SO HOW DID YOU GET ON 
YOUR SPECIFICATION SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING 
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO PRESENT YOUR SPECIFICATIONAS A LIST 
THIS IS CLEAR AND PROVIDES A GOOD CHECKLIST TO MAKE SURE YOU'VE COVERED EVERYTHING 
WHEN YOU'RE DEVELOPING YOUR IDEAS 
ONCE YOU'VE DECIDED ON YOUR BRIEF AND DRAWN UP YOUR SPECIFICATION 
THE NEXT STEP IS TO GENERATE A WIDE RANGE OF INITIAL DESIGN SOLUTIONS 
WHETHER YOU'RE DESIGNING SOMETHING FOR YOUR COURSEWORK OR IN AN EXAM 
A KEY TO SUCCESS IS TO GENERATE AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF INITIAL IDEAS 
THIS CAN BE DAUNTING BUT A GOOD STARTING POINT IS TO EVALUATE OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS 
THIS IS WHAT THE TEAM OF DESIGNERS WORKING ON THE PERSIL TRAVEL PACK PROTOTYPE DID 
WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING 
WRITE DOWN HOW THEY USE RESEARCH TO HELP THEM GENERATE IDEAS 
ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY COMMUNICATE THEIR IDEAS 
KEEP BOTH PRODUCTS IN BOTTLES FOR THE MOMENT ALL RIGHT 
AND JUST GO THROUGH WE TALKED ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT CLOSURES YES 
AND EXPOSE THE CLOSURES 
ONE'S GOING TO BE A FLIP TOP YES A FLIP TOP AND ONE'S GOING TO BE A SCREW CAP 
YOU CAN PUT SOME DEVICE ON THE TOP 
WE'VE GOT TWO TUBES YES 
WHAT WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH IS HOW DO YOU ELEVATE THE PRESENTATION OF A TUBE 
RATHER THAN JUST A ROUND BODY CLOSED SEAL HOW DO YOU COLLATE THEM WITHOUT JUST SAYING 
HERE'S A MULTI BUY OF TWO TUBES LET'S MAKE TWO TUBES WORK BETTER 
WE COULD HAVE A FLIP TOP WITH SOME LOCKING DEVICE ON SO WE'RE GIVING THE FLIP TOP SOME ADDED VALUE 
AND EXPRESSING ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT SECURITY AND IT NOT OPENING IN YOUR SUITCASE 
YOU COULD HAVE A FLIP TOP THAT LOCKED OVER A HINGE THAT LOCKS 
O. K. SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE TUBE IS A GREAT IDEA 
THE SACHET IS A GREAT IDEA 
AND IS IT THE ONE AT THE BOTTOM YES WELL THE BOTTLE THE BOTTLE 
SO WE'VE GOT OUR THREE FRONT RUNNERS 
WHICH WE'LL SPEND SOME TIME WORKING UP 
NEVER MIND SOUP AND WASHING UP LIQUID LET'S COME BACK TO TRAVEL WASH 
I'VE GOT SOME THINGS I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU 
SHE'S GOING FOR IT HERE WE GO THE FIRST ONE 
IT'S TWO TUBES WHICH ARE CLIPPED TOGETHER 
AND COULD BE SNAPPED APART 
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'D WANT TO CARRY THAT WITH YOU 
WHY NOT TAKE THE SACHETS OUT AND SPREAD THEM AROUND YOUR CASE 
IF I BOUGHT IT SAY A WEEK BEFORE WE WENT AWAY I'D PUT THAT IN THE BAG AND FORGET IT WAS THERE 
I WOULDN'T BE BOTHERED UNDOING IT AND TAKING ALL THE SACHETS OUT THERE'S ANOTHER DIAGRAM 
THIS PLASTIC SORT OF TRAY 
BRINGING THEM THE ACTUAL PACK TO SHOW THEM THAT WAS USEFUL 
THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS NOVEL TO BE ABLE TO CLIP THAT IN LIKE THAT 
I'M NOT SURE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS USEFUL 
WELL ACTUALLY FASTEN TOGETHER AND LOCK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
SO MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ONE NUMBER THREE WAS THE BOTTLE 
IT DOESN'T LOOK AS ATTRACTIVE WHAT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE ABOUT IT IT LOOKS BULKY CHUNKY LOOKING 
IT IS CHUNKY YES THE OTHER'S MUCH NICER TO LOOK AT 
THE FACT THAT WE'VE PICKED UP SOME OF THE BRANDING STYLE WAS A NEGATIVE 
THEY SAID DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE BRAND WORRY ABOUT MY SUITCASE 
I EXPECTED THIS TO END UP FLAT BUT IT'S STILL HANGING UPSIDE DOWN 
I'M NOT TRYING TO PUT YOU OFF IT BUT IT'S VERY SEARCHING WE'RE BUILDING A PROBLEM INTO THE DESIGN 
IT'S GOING TO MAKE THE FIT OF THE CAP MUCH MORE CRUCIAL 
YOU'LL HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THIS AND TELL ME THE ADVANTAGES OF IT 
IS THIS REALLY GOING TO STOP IT DO YOU NEED TO GET ROUND IT NOW THERE ARE WAYS OF GETTING ROUND IT 
BUT WE NEED TO BEAR IN MIND ALL THE WAY THROUGH THERE IS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM WAITING THERE 
DID YOU NOTICE HOW THEY DEVELOPED THEIR INITIAL IDEAS 
FIRST THEY COMPARED AND ANALYSED OTHER PRODUCTS CONSIDERING THEIR PROS AND CONS 
THEN THEY CONDUCTED MARKET RESEARCH TO FIND OUT THE NEEDS OF CONSUMERS 
USING THIS RESEARCH THEY PRODUCED CONCEPT DRAWINGS AND MODELS AND GOT CONSUMERS TO EVALUATE THEM 
THEY GOT ADVICE FROM MANUFACTURERS ON THE BEST PRODUCTION PROCESSES 
AND FINALLY THEY CONSIDERED THE MATERIALS FUNCTION 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT 
IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN RESEARCHING 
AND DEVELOPING A PRODUCT TO CONSIDER THE ERGONOMICS OF THE DESIGN 
THIS IS THE HUMAN FACTOR THE INTERACTION BETWEEN USER AND PRODUCT 
TO DO THIS DESIGNERS OFTEN USE ANTHROPOMETRIC DATA 
THE DATA DERIVED FROM HUMAN DIMENSIONS 
THESE ARE USED AS A GUIDE DURING THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT HOW THEY COMMUNICATED THEIR IDEAS 
THEY MOSTLY CONVEYED THEM GRAPHICALLY WITH DRAWINGS AND NOTES 
YOU WILL NEED TO USE SKETCHES WITH ANNOTATIONS YOURSELF 
USE THEM TO SHOW THE EXAMINER HOW YOU THINK PRODUCTS SATISFY 
THEIR DESIGN SPECIFICATION 
LOOK AT THE WEBSITE FOR MORE ON DRAWING TECHNIQUES 
OFTEN THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING A PRODUCT CAN TAKE YEARS 
FROM THE FIRST IDEA TO THE FINISHED PRODUCT 
AS IT'S BEING REFINED AND DEVELOPED FURTHER 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CLIP COMING UP 
WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING MAKE A NOTE OF THE DEVELOPMENT STAGES INVOLVED 
MY NAME'S ALEXANDER TAYLOR I'VE BEEN DESIGNING FOR FOUR YEARS NOW 
MY STUDIO WHICH IS AT THE BACK OF A SHOP 
GIVES ME A REALLY GOOD AND UP TO DATE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING 
AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE ATTRACTED TO FROM A DESIGN POINT OF VIEW 
YOU NEED TO SET YOURSELF BRIEFS ESSENTIALLY 
TO DESIGN SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY FOR A SITUATION OR A LAUNCH 
I HADN'T DESIGNED A LAMP SO I THOUGHT I'LL SET MYSELF A BRIEF 
AND ESSENTIALLY IT WAS DESIGN A SMALL TABLE LAMP 
THERE'S A LOT OF LIGHTING OUT THERE SO TO TRY AND BE ORIGINAL I DID RESEARCH ON THE MARKET 
I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GO OUT AND SOURCE THREE DIFFERENT COMPANIES TO MAKE THIS 
I DON'T WANT TO FIND SOMEONE TO CUT THE WOOD FOR ME AND FINISH IT 
I WANNA REALLY FIND SOMEONE THAT'S GONNA TURN AND CLEAN UP THE METAL WORK FOR ME 
THEN I'VE GOTTA GO TO A SHADE MANUFACTURER AND GET A SHADE PRODUCED 
LET ALONE SOURCING THE FABRIC 
THAT GOT ME THINKING AS TO COULD I CREATE SOMETHING FROM A SINGLE MATERIAL 
AND ULTIMATELY A SINGLE FLAT SHEET OF MATERIAL 
WHAT I STARTED WITH WAS THE BASIC NET FOR A BOX 
WHICH MIGHT GIVE ME THE SHADE OF THE LAMP 
AT THIS STAGE YOU DON'T NEED WANNA REALLY BE CONSIDERING EXACT DIMENSIONS 
AND REALLY THINKING ABOUT SCALE TOO MUCH 
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE SCALE IN YOUR MIND WHAT'S THAT IN BETWEEN PROCESS 
THAT GAVE ME A SHADE SO 
NO EXPENSE AT THE MOMENT 
ANOTHER SHEET OF PAPER 
ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT FROM ONE PIECE 
I'M GONNA JUST CUT 
WHAT I THINK A STAND COULD BE LIKE 
AND MAYBE 
AN ACTUAL BASE 
IF THOSE TWO WERE TO BE PUT TOGETHER 
THIS MIGHT START TO WORK AS A LAMP 
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO STABILITY THERE 
AND IT'S OFFSET AS WELL THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE SO FAR AS THE BASE 
AND THEN THE SHADE IS OVER TO ONE SIDE 
BUT THAT'S EASILY REMEDIED SIMPLY BY ADDING ANOTHER FOLD THERE 
IT SORT OF SITS IN THE CENTRE IT'S IN THE CENTRE 
NOW I NEED TO CONSIDER HOW CAN I FOLD THE FOOT BACK 
IF I WAS TO CUT A NEGATIVE 
SO BY SIMPLY PUTTING ANOTHER FOLD IN THERE AND FOLDING IT BACK ON ITSELF 
THEN THAT ALSO BRINGS A FULL BASE 
THE NEXT STAGE IS TO ACTUALLY GO TO THE COMPUTER 
AND WE CAN WORK WITH THE DRAWING 
ONCE I HAD THE DRAWING ON THE MACHINE 
I'LL BE ABLE TO FIRE IT OFF TO A LASER CUTTER 
THAT ACTUALLY TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES 
GAVE ME MY FIRST LAMP 
ALTHOUGH IT ACTUALLY DID CREATE THE FORM AND GAVE IT SOME STRUCTURE 
IT BECAME OBVIOUS THERE WERE CERTAIN ISSUES INVOLVED 
WITH ACTUALLY GOING ON TO CONSIDERING A PRODUCTION VERSION IN PERSPEX 
NOT ONLY DID IT TAKE ME ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO FOLD IT UP 
LINE BENDING ACROSS CERTAIN SECTIONS OF IT 
WAS GONNA CAUSE DISTRESS IN THE MATERIAL OR BEND PARTS OF THE MATERIAL 
WHICH BASICALLY DIDN'T WANT TO BE BENT 
ALEXANDER TURNED TO METAL FIRST BRASS 
THIS LOOKED GOOD COMBINING A TRADITIONAL MATERIAL WITH A CONTEMPORARY DESIGN 
BUT WAS WOBBLY AND TIME CONSUMING TO MAKE 
TAKING THIRTY MINUTES TO CLEAN EACH LAMP 
NEXT HE CHOSE STEEL 
CREATING PERFORATIONS SO HE COULD BEND THE PROTOTYPE HIMSELF 
STILL NOT SATISFIED HE FOUND IT TOO CLUNKY HE TRIED ALUMINIUM 
WHICH HE ANODISED 
HE HAD A BATCH IF TWO HUNDRED MADE UP AND ADDED A TRADITIONAL STYLE TWISTED CABLE 
ALL THAT HARD WORK PAID OFF 
THE FOLD LAMP WAS SELECTED BY A PRESTIGIOUS BRITISH MANUFACTURER 
ALEXANDER TAYLOR STARTED HIS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 
BY SETTING HIMSELF A BRIEF TO DESIGN A SMALL TABLE LAMP 
THAT COULD BE MADE FROM A SINGLE FLAT SHEET OF MATERIAL 
IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THIS DESIGN ALEXANDER MADE A SERIES OF MODELS 
HIS FIRST FAIRLY ROUGH MODEL WAS MADE OUT OF PAPER 
HE USED THIS TO WORK OUT THE OVERALL SHAPE OF THE LAMP 
HE BEGAN BY MAKING THE SHADE THEN ADDED A STEM AND BASE TO SUPPORT IT 
ALONG THE WAY HE MODIFIED AND ADAPTED HIS IDEAS TO MAKE THE DESIGN WORK 
HE NEEDED TO MAKE IT MORE STABLE SO PUT A BEND IN THE STEM 
AND FOLDED BACK PART OF THE BASE 
THIS CREATED A NEGATIVE SHAPE AND MADE THE WHOLE DESIGN MORE BALANCED AND STABLE 
NEXT HE USED C. A. D. COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN TO DRAW THE NET 
THIS NET COULD BE OUTPUT TO A LASER CUTTER TO PRODUCE A PROTOTYPE 
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF COMPUTER AIDED MANUFACTURE CAM 
HIS FIRST VERSION OF THE LAMP WAS MADE OUT OF AN ACRYLIC 
THIS REQUIRED A HEATED LINE BENDER 
TO CREATE THE FOLDS WHICH CAUSED PROBLEMS AT THE POINT WHERE THE BULB HOLDER FITS INTO THE STEM 
HIS PROTOTYPE IN BRASS BROUGHT A TRADITIONAL APPEARANCE TO THE LAMP 
BUT WAS VERY TIME CONSUMING TO CLEAN AND THEREFORE NOT COST EFFECTIVE 
HE DISMISSED HIS STEEL VERSION AS IT WAS TOO CLUNKY 
AND FINALLY CHOSE TO USE ALUMINIUM WITH AN ANODISED FINISH 
WHEN YOU'RE DESIGNING ANY PRODUCT YOU'LL NEED TO DEVELOP YOUR DESIGN BY MODELLING 
YOU CAN COPY ALEXANDER'S STRATEGIES TO GET YOUR DESIGN RIGHT 
THESE SHOULD INCLUDE CARD MODELS TEST PIECES 
MOCK UPS AND PROTOTYPES 
COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN AND COMPUTER AIDED MANUFACTURE 
WILL ALSO HELP YOU DEVELOP IDEAS AND PRODUCE YOUR FINAL PRODUCT 
FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THESE ON THE WEBSITE 
COMING IS A CLIP SHOWING HOW THE LAMP WAS DEVELOPED FOR HIGH PRODUCTION 
MAKE NOTES ON THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE 
IT REQUIRED AN EXPERT MANUFACTURER TO TAKE ALEXANDER TAYLOR'S FOLD LAMP INTO THE HIGH STREET 
MY NAME IS MARK HOLMES I'M DESIGN DIRECTOR OF ESTABLISHED AND SONS 
ESTABLISHED AND SONS IS A BRITISH BASED FURNITURE MANUFACTURING COMPANY 
WE ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN MANUFACTURING IN THE U. K. 
AND ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN NURTURING THE BEST OF BRITISH BASED DESIGN TALENT 
WE SAW THE FOLD LIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME A FEW YEARS AGO 
AND ALEX FOR US HAS A VERY DISTINCT DESIGN PERSONALITY 
HE DESIGNS IN A VERY MODEST BUT CLEVER WAY 
HE DESIGNS GREAT PRODUCTS FOR VOLUME PRODUCTION 
THE OBVIOUS QUALITIES OF THE FOLD LIGHT ARE ITS ABILITY TO BE PRODUCED IN VOLUME 
AND THE ACTUAL QUITE BEAUTIFUL FORM WHICH DERIVES OUT OF A QUITE TIGHT DESIGN BRIEF 
SO THIS IS THE LAMP AS IT WAS FIRST PRESENTED TO US 
ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T LOOK RADICALLY DIFFERENT TO THE LIGHT WE'RE PRODUCING NOW 
THERE ARE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE DETAIL WHICH HAD TO BE CHANGED IN ORDER FOR IT TO GO INTO VOLUME PRODUCTION 
THE THING WE HAD TO CHANGE WAS THE FACT THAT THIS IS ANODISED 
WHICH IS ALTHOUGH A BEAUTIFUL FINISH 
UNFORTUNATELY A PRE TEMPERAMENTAL FINISH 
WE CAN'T BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE CONSTANTLY HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE REJECTS 
SO WE ADOPTED A UM 
AN APPROACH WHICH INVOLVED POWDER COATING 
WHEN YOU ANODISE THE ALUMINIUM IT STIFFENS THE MATERIAL UP 
SO THEREFORE WITH POWDER COATING 
IT ACTUALLY REMAINED QUITE SOFT AS A MATERIAL 
WITH THAT IN MIND WE DECIDED TO PRODUCE THE LIGHTING 
IN THE SMALLER VERSION AS YOU CAN SEE NOW IN STEEL IT BEING A MORE RIGID MATERIAL TO WORK WITH 
IN DOING THAT WE ALSO ACHIEVED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEIGHTINESS 
WHICH WE FOUND QUITE AN ATTRACTIVE FEATURE OF THE NEW REVISED PRODUCT 
SECONDLY IT WAS DOWN TO FOLD DETAILS 
THE DETAILING MAKES THE DIFFERENCE 
IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU DEVELOP A PRODUCT THAT GOES THROUGH MANY STAGES 
MANY PROTOTYPES ARE POTENTIALLY MADE 
AND THERE'S OFTEN NOT A LOT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EACH ONE OF THOSE PROTOTYPES 
BUT IT'S ALL PART OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE PRODUCT AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE PRODUCT FROM CONCEPT 
TO ENTERING THE MARKET 
AT THE SAME TIME AS CHANGING THAT ON THE PROFILE 
TO TAKE OFF WHERE THIS PIECE OF MATERIAL CATCHES THE SHADE 
YOU CAN HEAR IT CATCHING THERE 
IT'S QUITE SIMPLY A CASE OF BRINGING THIS LINE AND CUTTING ACROSS HERE 
AND TAKING THAT MATERIAL AWAY IT ACTUALLY HELPS COME OUT OF THE BASE OF THE LAMP ANYWAY 
I INITIALLY SHOWED THE LAMPS WITH SIX DIFFERENT COLOURS OF CABLES 
NOW ALTHOUGH IT'S NICE TO HAVE THAT CHOICE IN AN ACTUAL RETAIL ENVIRONMENT 
FROM A PRODUCTION POINT OF VIEW YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HOLDING STOCK OF SIX DIFFERENT COLOURS OF CABLES 
YOU WANNA TRY AND HOLD SOMETHING BACK AND WITH A PRODUCT LIKE THIS 
ITS LIFESPAN IS ACTUALLY EXTENDED 
BY THE FACT THAT IT CAN BE PROVIDED AND SPECIFIED 
IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS FOR MANY MORE YEARS TO COME 
THEIR DISCUSSIONS LEAD TO A SUBTLE TRANSFORMATION IN THE DESIGN 
FROM ALEXANDER'S VERSION TO THE FINAL VERSION OF THE FOLD LAMP 
THIS IS WHERE THE SHADE FOLD HAS CHANGED 
AND THIS SECTION SUPPORTING THE BULB HOLDER HAS BEEN REDUCED 
I PERSONALLY LIKE TO GO AND SEE WHERE THINGS ARE MADE 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN SPRINGBOARD IDEAS 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR PRODUCT IS MADE 
SO PART OF THAT PROCESS IS TO GO AND VISIT THE PEOPLE MAKING THEM 
HOW'S THIS ONE GOING FINE 
THIS IS THE FOURTH FOLD THAT YOU'RE DOING 
TRYING TO GET ACROSS THE STANDARD THAT YOU'RE AFTER IS VERY IMPORTANT 
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MARKET YOU'RE TRYING TO HIT BECAUSE 
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT THEY'RE USED TO MAKING 
AND IT'S UP TO US TO GO AND HELP THEM OUT THERE AND EDUCATE THEM AS TO WHAT QUALITY WE'RE AFTER 
BASED ON THE AGREED CAB DESIGN 
NETS ARE ARRANGED IN THE MOST ECONOMICAL WAY 
TO GET THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OUT OF A SINGLE SHEET OF STEEL 
THE GEM CODES CONTROL THE LASER CUTTER WHICH CUTS OUT THE NETS 
ALTHOUGH MISTAKES ARE UNLIKELY CHECKING IS STILL IMPORTANT 
THE NET IS THEN COLD BENT SEVEN TIMES IN A BENDING PRESS 
AND CHECKED AFTER EVERY FOLD 
WITH THE FINAL FOLD THE LAMP TAKES SHAPE 
AFTER BEING CLEANED IT'S READY TO BE POWDER COATED IN A RANGE OF COLOURS 
HEATING MELTS THE POWDER COATING WHICH FIXES IT TO THE SURFACE 
CREATING A DECORATIVE AND PROTECTIVE FILM COATING 
ALL THE COMPONENTS THEN COME TOGETHER THE ELECTRIC CABLES WITH SWITCHES AND PLUGS 
AS WELL AS THE BULB HOLDER 
FROM HERE IT'S PLACED IN ITS BOX READY TO BE SOLD 
NOW HERE'S THE PROCESS AS A SEQUENCE DIAGRAM 
I'M VERY PROUD OF THE LIGHT I THINK WE ALL ARE AS A COMPANY 
THE DESIGN HAS BECOME ICONIC IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME 
THEY ARE SELLING INCREDIBLY WELL IN THE STORES 
AND THEY'RE A GREAT REPRESENTATION OF ALEX'S WORK AS A DESIGNER 
IT ACTUALLY FULFILS THE BRIEF AND MORE ACTUALLY 
IT'S STILL FOLLOWED FROM ONE SHEET OF MATERIAL IT'S MOVED ON TO A SUPERIOR POWDER COATED FINISH 
IT'S MOVED FROM ALUMINIUM TO STEEL BUT THAT'S HELPED THE PRODUCT AS WELL 
THE COMBINATION OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND CHANGES HAS REALLY MADE THE LAMP 
WHAT IT IS AND I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULT OF THE FOLD LAMP 
THAT CLIP SHOWED HOW AN EXPERT BRITISH MANUFACTURER 
DEVELOPED ALEXANDER'S DESIGN AND CAME UP WITH A MANUFACTURER'S SPECIFICATION 
SO IT COULD BE PRODUCED IN A HIGHER VOLUME 
TO MAKE SURE THE LAMP WOULD BE MADE WITH A CONSISTENT FINISH 
THEY DECIDED TO POWDER COAT THE LAMP RATHER THAN ANODISE IT 
SO THEY WERE LESS LIKELY TO GET DEFECTS 
ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS TO THE ACTUAL MATERIAL 
FROM ALUMINIUM TO STEEL THIS ADDED WEIGHT WHICH ALEXANDER AND MARK AGREED WAS DESIRABLE 
THEY ALSO MODIFIED THE NET 
THEY SLIGHTLY ADAPTED SOME OF THE FOLDS AND REDUCED THE SECTION 
THAT LINKED THE SHADE TO THE STEM AND BULB HOLDER 
THIS STOPPED THE RISK OF THE LAMP BEING DAMAGED DURING TRANSPORTATION 
AS WELL AS ALLOWING MORE LIGHT TO BE DIRECTED FROM THE BOTTOM 
IN THAT CLIP YOU SAW THE DETAILS OF THE FINAL DESIGN SOLUTION 
AND HOW THAT WAS TRANSFORMED INTO THE MANUFACTURED PRODUCT 
IN YOUR EXAM AND COURSEWORK IT'S CRUCIAL THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO EXPLAIN 
HOW A PRODUCT IS ACTUALLY MADE COMMERCIALLY MANUFACTURED 
SO WHERE DO YOU START 
WELL FIRST 
THIS IS WHERE YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING 
OF YOUR FOCUS AREA IS VITAL 
IN THE FOLD LAMP CLIP 
YOU SAW HOW THE MANUFACTURERS DECIDED ON A PRODUCTION PLAN 
SO IT COULD BE MADE EFFICIENTLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY 
THE SEQUENCE DIAGRAM SHOWED ALL THE STAGES OF THE LAMP'S MANUFACTURE 
IN THE EXAM AND IN YOUR COURSEWORK 
YOU'LL NEED TO 
IF YOU DON'T PLAN YOUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULE PROPERLY 
YOU'LL LOSE MARKS 
SO YOU NEED TO IDENTIFY 
YOU ALSO NEED TO CONSIDER HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES 
AND CARRY OUT RISK AND HAZARD ASSESSMENTS 
QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS ARE ESSENTIAL 
AND ARE MADE AT CRITICAL STAGES OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS 
TO ENSURE THE PRODUCT REACHES ITS DESIRED QUALITY 
AND CONFORMS TO BRITISH STANDARDS 
FINAL QUALITY ASSURANCE IS GIVEN WHEN A PRODUCT IS OF THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARD 
MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN QUALITY ASSURANCE 
AND QUALITY CONTROL 
AS YOU WATCH THE CLIP COMING UP MAKE A NOTE OF THE 
THE CLIP INVOLVES A NEW SMART MATERIAL CALLED ELECTRO LUMINESCENT INK 
LIKE ALL SMART MATERIALS IT REACTS TO ITS ENVIRONMENT 
IN THIS CASE CHANGES COLOUR AND GROWS BRIGHTLY WHEN A CURRENT IS APPLIED TO IT 
YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT SMART MATERIALS ON THE WEBSITE 
THIS IS THE CLEAN ROOM OF AN ELECTRONICS FACTORY IN CAERPHILLY 
AND CHRIS FRYER IS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE COMPANY WHAT'S GOING ON HERE 
HERE WE'RE PRINTING INKS ON TO A PLASTIC FILM 
WE PRINT ELECTRICAL INKS 
AND INKS THAT EMIT LIGHT 
THEY GLOW WHEN YOU PUT AN ELECTRIC FIELD ON THEM 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE FAR END OF THIS MACHINE 
WHAT'S SO REVOLUTIONARY ABOUT THIS PRODUCT 
BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY'S ALL PRINTED EVERY LAYER ON IT IS PRINTED 
THESE CAN BE MANUFACTURED VERY CHEAPLY 
WHICH MEANS WE CAN USE IT ON DIFFERENT PRODUCTS 
THIS LOOKS LIKE A FANCY ELECTRONICS PLANT IT'S PRINTED ELECTRONICS 
THIS IS WHAT COMES OUT THE OTHER END 
THIS IS THE FIRST STAGE OF THE PROCESS ANY THE WISER 
NO FOLLOW ME 
THIS IS ANOTHER BIT OF THE FACTORY 
CHRIS WHAT IS THIS THIS CUTS OUR PRODUCT OUT WITH A SIMPLE STAMP PROCESS 
A LOT OF OUR COMPETITORS USE GLASS TO MAKE THEIR PRODUCTS ON 
BUT OURS IS PLASTIC SO IT'S MUCH EASIER AND QUICKER TO CUT OUT 
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT NOW 
LET'S GO ON TO THE NEXT STAGE 
SO THIS IS ONE OF THE FINAL BITS OF PRODUCTION CHRISTINE WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
I'M TESTING THE PRODUCT TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS 
WHAT'S THIS PICTURE HERE 
THESE ARE THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS THAT LIGHT UP 
AND THE BOXES ARE RED IF THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS 
IT'LL LIGHT UP AND SHOW ME HOW MANY PROBLEMS DO YOU GET VERY FEW 
CHRIS PUT US OUT OF OUR MISERY WHAT IS THIS THING THAT WE SAW CHRISTINE TESTING 
IT'S A FLEXIBLE PLASTIC DISPLAY PRODUCT 
WE PUT IT INTO PRODUCTS LIKE THIS 
AND THIS IS A REMOTE CONTROL 
SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS LIGHT UP THE BUTTONS THAT DO SOMETHING AT ANY TIME 
THAT'S HOW IT MAKES TECHNOLOGY SIMPLER TO USE 
INSTEAD OF A FOREST OF BUTTONS YOU HAVE ONLY THE BUTTONS YOU NEED AT THE TIME 
IF YOU'RE CONTROLLING YOUR VIDEO RECORDER THEN YOU NEED YOUR FAST FORWARD AND YOUR REWIND BUTTONS 
PLAY AND STOP SAY YOU'RE USING YOUR T. V. 
AND YOU DON'T NEED ANY OF THOSE BUTTONS IT TURNS THEM OFF 
O. K. BUT WE'VE ALL SEEN SMALL SCREENS LIKE THIS ON MOBILE PHONES 
AND WE'VE ALL SEEN TOUCH SCREEN TECHNOLOGY SO WHAT'S SO REMARKABLE ABOUT YOUR PRODUCT 
THERE'S A FEW KEY FEATURES YOU CAN PRESS BUTTONS THROUGH IT 
IT'S BENDY 
WHEN YOU PRESS THESE BUTTONS YOU STILL GET A CLICK BEHIND THEM 
IN THAT CLIP YOU SAW HOW THE WORKING ENVIRONMENT WAS ORGANISED 
AND HOW THE PRODUCT MOVED FROM STAGE TO STAGE 
THE PRODUCTION PROCESS 
FIRST CAME THE PRINTING STAGE 
THEN IT MOVED ON TO BE STAMPED 
NEXT IT WENT THROUGH QUALITY CONTROL 
BEFORE BEING ASSEMBLED AND FINALLY TESTED 
HEALTH AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS ARE AN ESSENTIAL FOR EVERY COMPANY 
YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOTTED EVERYONE WORE CLEAN PROTECTIVE CLOTHING 
TO PROTECT TRAINED OPERATORS FROM THE CHEMICALS USED IN THE PROCESS 
THE AIR CONDITIONING CONTROLLED THE LEVEL CHEMICALS IN THE AIR 
IN ALL MANUFACTURING SITUATIONS QUALITY CONTROL INSPECTIONS 
TEST AND MONITOR THE QUALITY ACCURACY AND FITNESS FOR PURPOSE OF A PRODUCT 
IN THIS CASE THE ELECTRO LUMINESCENT INKS USED IN THE DISPLAY 
ARE TESTED TO SEE IF THEY WORK CORRECTLY 
BEFORE BEING PASSED ON FOR FINAL ASSEMBLY 
SEQUENCE DRAWINGS OR FLOW CHARTS ARE THE BEST WAY 
TO EXPLAIN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS 
THERE'S MORE ON FLOW CHARTS IN THE SYSTEMS AND CONTROL SECTION 
OF PROGRAMME TWO 
AND DON'T FORGET YOU CAN SEE MANY EXAMPLES OF PRODUCTION PROCESSES 
THROUGHOUT THE TWO DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMMES 
PRODUCING YOUR END PRODUCT SUCCESSFULLY 
ISN'T THE END OF THE STORY 
THERE'S ONE FINAL STAGE TO THE PROCESS 
YOU STILL NEED TO EVALUATE THE PRODUCT 
PRODUCT EVALUATION IS NOT JUST SOMETHING YOU DO AT THE END OF YOUR PROJECT 
YOU HAVE TO EVALUATE AT EVERY STAGE OF THE PROCESS 
YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE PRODUCTS IN YOUR EXAM 
WHEN YOU ANALYSE ANY PRODUCT 
THE KEY IS TO EVALUATE IT AGAINST ITS BRIEF AND SPECIFICATION 
HOW WELL HAS IT MET ITS AIMS 
AND HOW WELL DOES IT DO ITS JOB 
SUGGEST MODIFICATIONS IF YOU CAN 
AND IDEALLY TEST THE PRODUCT IN ITS INTENDED SETTING 
TRY TO BE OBJECTIVE 
DON'T LET YOUR PERSONAL TASTES SWAY YOU 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS NEXT SEQUENCE 
WHICH SHOWS HOW THE RADOX SHOWER GEL CONTAINER WAS REDESIGNED 
NOTE HOW THE PRODUCT DEVELOPER ANALYSES THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE DESIGN 
THEN ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS 
THESE GREEN BOTTLES ABOUT TO BE FILLED WITH SHOWER GEL 
HAVE BEEN NEWLY REDESIGNED TO HELP KEEP THE PACKAGE A BRAND LEADER 
IN THE CASE OF THE OLD PACK 
BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH FORCE 
WHEN IT STRETCHED BACK OUT TO ITS ORIGINAL SHAPE 
WE ENDED UP WITH A PACK 
HAVING THE AIR SUCKED OUT OF IT AS YOU PUMPED THE GEL 
SO LITERALLY AS YOU DO THAT PRODUCT AND AIR COMES OUT 
BUT THE AIR DOESN'T COME BACK IN AND YOU END UP EVENTUALLY 
AT THE END WITH THIS MUCH GEL LEFT IN IT 
THE WHOLE THING IS FLAT LIKE A TUBE OF TOOTHPASTE 
AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THE LAST INCH OR SO OUT OF THIS PACK 
IF WE COULD ALLOW THE AIR TO COME BACK IN THROUGH HAVING IT SPRING BACK OUT 
THEN WE COULD USE THE AIR LIKE A PISTON TO PUSH THE REMAINING GEL OUT 
THAT IS THE PRINCIPLE BEHIND THE NEW PACK 
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN WITH THAT ONE I'VE SQUEEZED IT ONCE AND I'VE GOT A HUGE DENT IN IT 
WITH THIS ONE IF I SQUEEZE IT IT POPS BACK QUITE WELL 
DESPITE THE VALVE TRYING TO STOP IT 
ANOTHER FEATURE WE'VE MADE WHICH WILL BE INVISIBLE 
WAS THAT WE'D MOVE THE NECK 
THE OLD PACK'S NECK IS OFF CENTRE 
BECAUSE OF THE VALVE ON THE PREVIOUS CAP THIS ONE 
IT WAS OFF CENTRE 
WE'VE MADE A COUPLE OF IMPROVEMENTS TO BOTH CAP AND BOTTLE 
TO GIVE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS 
ON THE NEW PACK WE'VE MADE THE NECK BIGGER 
IT'S A QUITE HUGE DIFFERENCE AND IT'S CENTRED 
THE LOGIC FOR THAT IS THE GEL WE FILL IS QUITE THICK 
AND WHEN WE FILL AT THE SPEEDS WE FILL AT THE GEL IS UNDER PRESSURE 
SQUIRTED IN THROUGH THIS HOLE SO THE WIDER THE HOLE 
THE MORE GEL YOU CAN GET IN AT SPEED AND 
IF IT'S IN THE CENTRE IT'S EASIER TO DESIGN THE MACHINERY TO CENTRE THE BOTTLE UP AND WHOOSH 
THE OLD CAP WAS A LOOSE FLOPPY HINGE 
WASN'T FRIENDLY FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH ARTHRITIC HANDS 
COS SOME OF THEM WERE DIFFICULT TO GET OPEN 
A CRITICISM WE SAW IN OUR TRADE MAGAZINE WAS THAT WHEN IT'S HANGING LIKE THAT 
UNLESS YOU'VE SPOTTED THERE'S A LATCH TO GET IT OUT THE WAY 
IT HANGS IN THE WAY OF THE VALVE 
AND YOU END UP DRIBBLING GEL ALL OVER IT AND HAVE A RIGHT MESS 
YOU HAVE TO RINSE IT 
WITH THE NEW ONE CHANGE THE OPENING FRONT TO BACK 
TO GO WITH THE CENTRED NECK ALSO OUT A LIGHT HINGE ON IT 
SO IT OPENS WITH A SPRING SO IT HANGS WELL AND TRULY OUT THE WAY 
WHAT I'M DOING IS CHECKING OFF THE OUTER DIMENSIONS 
THE EASIER DIMENSIONS TO MEASURE OF THE ACTUAL MOULDINGS VERSUS 
THE DRAWING THAT WE DID THREE SLASH FOUR MONTHS AGO 
THE MOULD HAS BEEN MANUFACTURED TO THESE DIMENSIONS 
THE PLASTIC THAT FLOWS INTO IT IS LIKE ANY MOULDING 
IT DOES SUBTLY DISTORT AND SHRINK AS IT COMES OUT THE MOULDING AND COOLS DOWN 
WE KNOW THAT BETWEEN CLEAR AND COLOURED CAPS 
THE RATE AT WHICH THE PLASTIC SHRINKS AS IT COMES OUT THE MOULD 
IS SUBTLY DIFFERENT 
WHAT WE'VE GOT ON THE NEWER CAP UNLIKE ITS PREDECESSOR 
IS WE PUT A BACK UP SEAL IN SO THAT EVEN IF IN A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE THAT THE VALVE WAS SOMEHOW DAMAGED 
OR THE VALVE WAS EVEN MISSING A FREAK IT CAME THROUGH THE MACHINE WITHOUT HAVING ONE FITTED 
THERE'S STILL A SEALING RING ON THE INSIDE OF THIS LID 
AND ON THE CORRESPONDING SURFACE OF THE BODY SO THAT WHEN IT'S ON THE ACTUAL BOTTLE 
AND YOU SEAL IT THEORETICALLY IF I'M RIGHT 
WHEN I SQUEEZE THIS IT'LL POP OPEN WITH A BANG 
BECAUSE THE AIR WILL COMPRESS AND SUDDENLY BURST THE CAP OPEN 
IF I'M WRONG IT'LL GO SSSS AND WE'LL FIND OUT THE HARD WAY SO LET'S GIVE IT A GO 
THERE YOU GO PERFECT 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR THAT BUT WHAT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE 
IS WE'VE CRACKED THE PANELLING PROBLEM THERE'S A TICKING 
THAT'S LITTLE BUBBLES SUCKING BACK INTO THE BOTTLE SO EACH TIME I SQUEEZE 
YOU CAN HEAR THE AIR POPPING BACK AND IT'S THE VALVE POPPING IN AND OUT 
THAT IS REALLY GOOD NEWS WE DESIGNED A SPRING ON THE FRONT OF THE BOTTLE THAT WOULD DO THAT 
IT WOULD PULL THE BOTTLE BACK INTO SHAPE PULL AIR IN AND AS THE BOTTLE BECOMES LOWER ON ITS CONTENTS 
AIR PUSHES THE SHOWER GEL OUT TOWARDS THE BOTTOM AND YOU GET THE WHOLE LOT OUT 
SO A FINAL TEST WHAT'S IT LIKE DISPENSING THE GEL 
BY THE LOOKS OF IT PRETTY GOOD THE GEL IS SCISSORED AS THE RUBBER VALVE CLOSES 
SO IT DOESN'T STRING IF YOU'VE EVER TRIED THIS STUFF I'LL SHOW YOU FROM THE BOTTLE 
WITHOUT A VALVE 
IT STRINGS AND STRINGS AND STRINGS 
AND WHAT THE VALVE DOES 
THE VALVE RELAXES BACK CLOSES AND SNIPS THE GEL 
SO HOW DID YOU GET ON 
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTICED THESE POINTS 
THE OLD CONTAINER DIDN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ACTION 
OF AIR AND GEL BEING SQUEEZED FROM THE CONTAINER TOGETHER 
THE BOTTLE BECAME COMPRESSED AND GEL REMAINED STUCK INSIDE 
THE NEW BOTTLE WAS DESIGNED TO POP BACK INTO SHAPE TO ALLOW AIR BACK IN 
TO PUSH ALL THE GEL OUT 
THIS BENEFITS THE CONSUMER 
THE OLD BOTTLE HAD AN OFF CENTRE NECK THIS WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE MANUFACTURERS TO FILL EFFICIENTLY 
THE NEW LARGER CENTRED NECK ALLOWED A FASTER INJECTION OF GEL AND MORE EASILY DESIGNED MACHINERY 
THIS WAS A BENEFIT FOR THE MANUFACTURERS AS THEY COULD PRODUCE THE FINISHED PRODUCT MORE QUICKLY 
THE ORIGINAL LOOSE FLOPPY HINGE WAS DIFFICULT FOR SOME PEOPLE TO OPEN 
AND ONCE OPEN OFTEN HUNG DOWN GETTING COVERED IN GEL 
THE NEW BOTTLE HAD A SIMPLER FRONT TO BACK FLAP 
WITH A LIVE HINGE WHICH AUTOMATICALLY HANGS OUT OF THE WAY 
CONSUMERS WOULD BENEFIT FROM INCREASED EASE OF USE 
FINALLY THE NEW CONTAINER HAD A NEW SEALING RING AS BACK UP FOR THE VALVE 
THIS MADE IT MORE SECURE FOR THE CONSUMER 
SO YOU SHOULD EVALUATE YOUR PRODUCTS IN TERMS OF 
THE AESTHETICS SUCH AS THE APPEARANCE TASTE SMELL OR FEEL 
HOW WELL IT PERFORMS ITS INTENDED FUNCTION 
CALLED FITNESS FOR PURPOSE 
THE ERGONOMICS IS IT COMFORTABLE AND SAFE TO USE 
AND FINALLY HAVE THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS 
SUCH AS HEALTH AND SAFETY AND BRITISH STANDARDS BEEN MET 
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT 
HERE'S OUR FIRST CHECKLIST TO RECAP 
WHEN YOU SET ABOUT DESIGNING AND MAKING A PRODUCT 
MY LITTLE TIP IS TO DO AS MANY PAST PAPERS AS POSSIBLE 
WHEN I WAS SITTING MY EXAMS I DID AS MANY AS I COULD 
TRUST ME IT'S THE BEST WAY TO PREPARE 
THAT'S THE END OF OUR DESIGNING AND MAKING SECTION 
CHECK OUT OUR WEBSITE FOR MORE INFORMATION AND EXERCISES 
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE FOCUS AREAS 
FIRST AN AREA YOU'LL NEED TO BE AWARE OF 
GRAPHIC PRODUCTS 
WHATEVER YOUR FOCUS AREA YOU NEED TO DEMONSTRATE 
AN ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE YOUR IDEAS THROUGH GRAPHICS 
SO CHECK THIS SECTION OUT 
STUDENTS STUDYING GRAPHIC PRODUCTS WILL NEED TO SHOW THEIR ABILITY TO 
THEY'RE OFTEN MADE OF PAPER AND CARD BUT THEY CAN BE PLASTIC LAMINATES OR EVEN ALUMINIUM FOIL 
THE COURSE WILL BE ASSESSED THROUGH COURSEWORK 
AND IN A FINAL EXAMINATION 
AS GOOD DESIGN IS THE KEY TO SUCCESSFUL GRAPHIC PRODUCTS 
WE'LL LOOK AT THIS IN DETAIL BUT DRAWING SKILLS ARE ALSO CRUCIAL 
SO WE'LL FOCUS ON THESE SKILLS AND ALSO FIND OUT ABOUT MANUFACTURING GRAPHIC PRODUCTS 
AS WELL AS GRAPHIC MECHANISMS 
AND ADVERTISING 
THIS IS AN AWARD WINNING DESIGN FOR A VERY COMMON GRAPHIC PRODUCT 
THE POSTER 
WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING TRY TO IDENTIFY THE KEY TO GOOD POSTER DESIGN 
HERE WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS LOST PROPERTY 
BUT I THINK THEY DO IT IN A REALLY SIMPLE WAY 
THEY'VE GOT THE DOTTED LINE YOU'VE LOST YOUR RING 
YOU'VE LOST YOUR TEDDY BEAR AND IT SAYS QUITE CLEARLY 
IF YOU'VE LOST SOMETHING RING UP THIS NUMBER 
IT TAKES YOU IN I THINK THAT'S A POWERFUL IMAGE YEAH 
SO THE STRIKINGLY SIMPLE POSTERS FOR SOUTH EASTERN TRAINS WERE THE JUDGES' FIRST CHOICE 
FOR THE SHORT LIST 
THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWENTY POSTERS IN THE SERIES 
COVERING TOPICS LIKE LEAVES ON THE LINE TO MINDING THE GAP 
PREVIOUSLY IN THE RAILWAYS IF THEY HAD A POSTER ABOUT LOST PROPERTY 
OR DON'T GO ON THE TRACK 
THEN IT WOULD LOOK LIKE A SCARY CHARITY AD 
AND WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WAS A RETURN TO OLDER VALUES 
DO SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD 
WHERE PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND LIKE THAT AND ALSO IF THEY WERE SITTING ON THE TRAIN 
YOU COULD READ THEM FROM THE TRAIN AND STILL UNDERSTAND THEM 
THESE ARE TWO OF THE FIRST THEY ASKED US TO DO 
AND THEY ASKED US TO DO LOST PROPERTY 
THEY'VE GOT THAT KIND OF HAND DRAWN QUALITY WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THAT AND NOT SOMETHING MORE SOPHISTICATED 
WE DIDN'T WANT THEM TO LOOK SCARY OR OVER DESIGNED SO WE'D DRAW THEM VERY SMALL 
AND THEN WE BLEW THEM UP MASSIVE AND THE ONES THAT WORKED REALLY WELL TOOK ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO DO IF THAT 
WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THEY STARTED TO ASK US TO DO MORE SERIOUS THINGS 
AND THESE ARE TWO QUITE SERIOUS POSTERS BUT THEY'RE COUCHED IN QUITE A HUMOROUS WAY 
THERE'S A VERY SCARY THING THAT CAN HAPPEN CERTAIN FREIGHT TRAINS CAN COME THROUGH A STATION 
AND THEY CAN BLOW PUSHCHAIRS INTO THE AIR 
SO MOTHERS MIGHT FIND THAT THEIR PUSHCHAIRS ARE GOING UP OVER THEIR HEADS 
SOUNDS TERRIFYING 
IT IS AND WE SAID WE CAN'T DO A POSTER OF THAT 
COS NO MOTHERS WOULD COME ON THE STATION WITH THEIR BABIES 
SO WE DID A POSTER THAT SHOWS A MAN LOSING HIS WIG 
AND PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT THIS AND GO OH THAT'S FUNNY 
THEN THEY WOULD READ THE COPY AND SEE THE POINT ABOUT PUSHCHAIRS EVEN WIGS BEING THROWN INTO THE AIR 
YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOTTED THAT THE KEY TO GOOD POSTER DESIGN IS ABOUT KEEPING IT SIMPLE 
PRESENTING INFORMATION CLEARLY AND MAKING IT QUICK AND EASY TO READ 
MAKE SURE YOU USE A GOOD MIXTURE OF IMAGES TEXT AND COLOUR 
SO THAT IT'S REALLY EYE CATCHING 
THIS HOLDS TRUE FOR ALL YOUR GRAPHIC WORK 
FOR ALL GRAPHIC PRODUCTS YOU'RE DESIGNING SOMETHING FOR A PURPOSE 
SO YOU WORK TO A SPECIFICATION 
A SET OF CRITERIA ON WHICH THE DESIGN IS BASED 
IN THE COMMERCIAL WORLD THE SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED BY CLIENTS 
THE FILM COMING UP FOLLOWS THE DESIGN OF DEVELOPMENT 
OF CARDBOARD PACKAGING FOR A BUNCH OF FLOWERS 
SEE HOW WELL YOU THINK THE DESIGN FITS THE SPECIFICATION 
DURING THIS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK 
AT THE VITAL DRAWING SKILLS TOO 
I'M DANIELLA CREED THE HEAD OF MARKETING AT BUNCHES FLORAPOST 
WE'RE BASED IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE IN THE MIDLANDS 
AND WE SEND FLOWERS BY POST THROUGHOUT THE U. K. 
AND HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS 
AT THE MOMENT WE SEND OUT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BOUQUETS A YEAR 
FIRSTLY WE RECEIVE OUR ORDERS IN THE CALL CENTRE 
AND THEY ARE RECEIVED EITHER THROUGH THE POST OVER THE PHONE 
OR OVER THE INTERNET 
THE RELEVANT STAFF PACK THESE FLOWERS 
AND PUT THE LABEL ON THE TOP OF THE BOX 
THE BOXES ARE PUT IN A TROLLEY WHICH ROYAL MAIL THEN COLLECTS UP 
EITHER AT TWELVE O'CLOCK OR FIVE O'CLOCK 
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE BUSINESS WE RECEIVE ORDERS 
AND SEND FLOWERS OUT IN A BOX 
FOR EVERY BOUQUET THAT BUNCHES SEND OUT 
THEY NEED A BOX TO PUT THE FLOWERS IN 
IT'S UP TO THE BOX TO PROVIDE THE FUNCTION OF PROTECTING THE FLOWERS 
MAKE SURE THERE'S MINIMAL MOVEMENT SO THE FLOWER HEADS DON'T DAMAGE 
SO WHEN THE FLOWERS ARRIVE THE CUSTOMER'S DELIGHTED 
IS OVERWHELMED WITH THEIR BIG BEAUTIFUL BOX 
THEN OPEN IT AND THERE'S FLOWERS IN PERFECT CONDITION 
WHICH IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT OUTER PACKAGING IT'S CRITICAL 
ALL THE BOXES ARRIVE FLAT PACKED AND ARE MADE UP ON SITE 
THEY'RE DESIGNED TO A PRECISE SPECIFICATION 
DEPENDING ON WHICH FLOWERS THEY'RE TRANSPORTING 
BUNCHES ARE DEVELOPING A NEW PREMIUM RANGE THE PLATINUM COLLECTION 
THESE WILL BE EXTRA SPECIAL HAND TIED BOUQUETS 
AND THE PACKAGING WILL BE CRUCIAL 
THE BOX THAT THEY ARRIVE IN HAS GOT TO LOOK EXPENSIVE 
AND HAS GOT TO DISPLAY THE FLOWERS 
IN A WAY THAT MAKES THEM LOOK WORTH THEIR MONEY 
THEY ARE A GIFT AND HAVE GOT TO BE PRESENTED AS A BEAUTIFUL GIFT 
DANIELLA EXPLAINED THAT THE DESIGN AND FUNCTION OF THE BOX WAS CRUCIAL 
TO THE SUCCESS OF HER NEW RANGE OF FLOWERS 
MOST IMPORTANTLY THE BOX HAS TO PROTECT THE FLOWERS 
SO THEY ARRIVE AT THEIR DESTINATION IN PRISTINE CONDITION 
IT HAS TO BE CONVENIENT SO THE FLOWERS COME OUT EASILY 
AND DURABLE THE MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE BOX 
NEED TO WITHSTAND THE JOURNEY 
THE LOOK OF THE BOX IS CRUCIAL 
IT'S A SPECIAL GIFT SO IT NEEDS TO LOOK SPECIAL 
IT HAS TO KEEP WITHIN THE STYLE OF THE BUNCHES BRAND 
BUT ENHANCE IT 
ALSO TODAY DESIGNERS HAVE TO TAKE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES SERIOUSLY 
ALL OF BUNCHES' BOXES ARE PRODUCED BY MONDI PACKAGING 
WHO SPECIALISE IN MAKING AND DESIGNING CARDBOARD BOXES 
HEAD DESIGNER MIKE RAPKINS 
IS DESIGNING A BOX TO DANIELLA'S SPECIFICATION 
IT'S UP TO HIM TO ENSURE THE BOX SUPPORTS THE FLOWERS 
AND THAT THEY CAN BE EASILY REMOVED 
THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS BOX IS ACTUALLY IN THE FITTING 
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE HEAD OF THE FLOWERS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 
CONSEQUENTLY AS I VISUALISE IT 
IT'S GOING TO BE A SERIES OF CONES THAT WE'VE GOT TO MAKE 
AND FIND WHICH ONE ACTUALLY DOES THE JOB BEST 
MIKE LIKE ALL DESIGNERS STARTS WITH A FREEHAND SKETCH 
THE BOX 
HAS A BASE FITTING 
WHICH CENTRALISES THE STEM 
THERE IS A CONICAL FITTING 
THAT DESCENDS FROM THE TOP EDGE OF THE BOX 
AND FORMS A CONE WHICH 
IF THE BUNCH OF FLOWERS IS TAKING UP THIS SHAPE 
ACTUALLY WORKS VERY WELL 
ALL DESIGNERS START OFF WITH FREEHAND SKETCHES 
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU'LL NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO FOR YOUR EXAM 
YOU'LL ALSO NEED TO TURN THOSE SKETCHES INTO TECHNICAL DRAWINGS 
SHOWING SCALE AND DIMENSIONS 
AND BOTH ISOMETRIC 
AND ORTHOGRAPHIC PROJECTIONS 
AN ISOMETRIC PROJECTION IS A THREE D. PICTORIAL DRAWING TECHNIQUE 
WHICH IGNORES PERSPECTIVE BUT ALLOWS YOU TO PRODUCE ACCURATE DRAWINGS 
OF OBJECTS TO SCALE 
TO DRAW THESE YOU MUST USE THE THIRTY DEGREE ANGLE 
ON THE SIXTY THIRTY T. H. S. SET SQUARE OR ISOMETRIC GRID 
FOR ISOMETRIC DRAWING A THIRTY DEGREE ANGLE IS USED FOR HORIZONTAL EDGES 
AND A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE FOR VERTICAL EDGES 
HERE'S ONE FOR THE FLOWER BOX DESIGN 
THE NEAREST EDGE OF THE DRAWING IS DRAWN FIRST 
AND THEN LINES ARE DRAWN BACK AT THIRTY DEGREES 
IGNORING PERSPECTIVE 
THIS WAY IT SHOWS DIMENSIONS ACCURATELY 
AND IN CORRECT PROPORTION TO EACH OTHER 
MAKING IT EASY TO DRAW THE PROJECTION TO SCALE 
FROM THIS YOU CAN PRODUCE EXPLODED VIEWS 
ASSEMBLY DRAWINGS WHICH SHOW HOW ALL THE PARTS FIT TOGETHER 
THE DRAWING YOU WORK FROM IN ORDER TO PRODUCE YOUR PRODUCT 
IS KNOWN AS A WORKING DRAWING 
THE IDEAL TYPE IS AN ORTHOGRAPHIC PROJECTION 
THIS SHOWS COMPLEX OBJECTS IN THREE TWO D. DRAWINGS 
THEY USUALLY CONSIST OF A FRONT VIEW A SIDE VIEW AND A PLAN VIEW 
THIS EXAMPLE IS CALLED A THIRD ANGLE PROJECTION 
IN THESE THE VIEW YOU SEE FROM THE RIGHT OF THE ORIGINAL OBJECT 
IS DRAWN ON THE RIGHT 
WHAT YOU SEE FROM ABOVE IS DRAWN ABOVE 
DIMENSIONS MUST ALSO BE INCLUDED 
AND ARE ALWAYS IN MILLIMETRES 
THERE ARE STRICT CONVENTIONS ON WHERE THESE MUST BE WRITTEN 
CHECK OUT THE WEBSITE TO BRUSH UP ON THESE 
AS WELL AS THE THIRD ANGLE ORTHOGRAPHIC PROJECTION 
THERE'S ALSO A FIRST ANGLE ORTHOGRAPHIC PROJECTION 
THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE THIRD ANGLE DRAWING 
AS IT INCLUDES ALL THE DIMENSIONS NECESSARY 
AS WELL AS A SIDE VIEW AN END VIEW AND A PLAN 
BUT THEY'RE LAID OUT DIFFERENTLY 
AGAIN ON THE BITESIZE WEBSITE 
YOU'LL FIND ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THESE 
ONCE YOU'VE COMPLETED YOUR TECHNICAL DRAWINGS 
IT'S TIME TO START MODELLING YOUR DESIGN AND MAKE A PROTOTYPE 
TODAY THIS IS OFTEN CARRIED OUT USING C. A. D. COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY USE AT MONDI PACKAGING 
AS YOU WATCH EVALUATE HOW WELL THIS PRODUCT MEETS ITS SPECIFICATION 
MIKE TRANSFORMS HIS INITIAL SKETCHES INTO COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN C. A. D. 
IT BECOMES A NET A TEMPLATE FOR CUTTING OUT THE CARDBOARD BOX AND ITS FITTINGS 
THIS IS THE FLOWER SUPPORT CONE SECTION 
RED LINES INDICATE CUT LINES 
WHILE GREEN LINES STAND FOR THE CREASES 
INCORPORATED WITHIN THE DESIGN 
ARE WHAT WE WOULD TERM KICK OUT AREAS 
THAT ACTUALLY SOFTEN THE CONE IN THE CORNERS 
AGAIN GIVING EXTRA PROTECTION AND SUPPORT TO THE HEAD OF THE FLOWERS 
THE LOCKING OF THE TWO FLOATING SIDES WE'VE GOT HERE 
AND THIS IS GOING TO BE THE DOUBTFUL AREA 
WE NEED TO CHECK THAT THAT'S GONNA WORK PROPERLY 
ONCE HE'S HAPPY WITH THE DESIGN 
IT GETS SENT THROUGH TO A PROTOTYPE CUTTING MACHINE 
THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW IF IT WILL WORK IS TO TEST IT 
THE LOCKING SECTION 
NEEDS A SMALL ADJUSTMENT 
THAT IS MUCH BETTER YEAH 
THESE HAND HOLES INSIDE THE CONE 
WILL MAKE IT EASY TO HANDLE THE FLOWERS 
THAT FILM SHOWED JUST HOW VALUABLE C. A. D. IS TO DESIGNING ANY PRODUCT 
IT TRANSFORMED DRAWINGS INTO ACCURATE PROTOTYPES 
THEN MODIFICATIONS WERE EASILY MADE 
ONCE COMPLETED THE DRAWINGS WERE SAVED ON THE COMPUTER 
ULTIMATELY THE WHOLE PROCESS WAS QUICK AND EFFICIENT 
MAKING IT EXTREMELY ECONOMIC 
OF COURSE DESIGNING THE BOX IS ALL ABOUT MEETING THE SPECIFICATION 
THAT MONDI WAS GIVEN BY DANIELLA 
HERE'S A REMINDER 
HAVE YOU NOTICED HOW MUCH OF DANIELLA'S SPECIFICATION 
HAS BEEN ACHIEVED SO FAR 
THE NEXT STAGE OF THE PRODUCT'S DEVELOPMENT IS GRAPHIC DESIGN 
TAKE NOTES ON HOW WELL THIS FULFILS THE SPECIFICATION 
NOW THE BOX IS COMPLETE EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS ITS GRAPHIC DESIGN 
IT NEEDS TO KEEP BUNCHES' CORPORATE STYLE 
BUT ALSO LOOK LIKE A SPECIAL GIFT 
MARK IS MONDI PACKAGING'S GRAPHIC DESIGNER 
THIS IS GOING TO BE A TWO COLOUR JOB 
UNLIKE AT THE MOMENT WHERE THEY DO A ONE COLOUR 
THE COLOURS THAT WE'VE CHOSEN 
ARE AS I SAY THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY WHICH IS A CORPORATE 
AND WE'VE CHOSEN A GREY 
THIS WILL GIVE A NICE PATTERN IN THE BACKGROUND 
BUT WILL NOT OVERPOWER THE CORPORATE COLOURS 
THE CUSTOMER HAS COME UP 
WITH AS I SAY THE BACKGROUND 
SHE LIKES THE IDEA OF ROSES OR FLOWERS 
AS A CARPET 
SO USING THAT IDEA 
WE'LL TAKE SOME PICTURES MAYBE DRAG SOMETHING OFF THE INTERNET 
AND SEE WHAT WE CAN COME UP WITH 
RIGHT I'M HAPPY WITH THE LAY OUT AS IT IS NOW 
NOW I'M GOING TO GO INTO ADOBE PHOTOSHOP 
BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT I'M IN ILLUSTRATOR 
AND WORK ON THE FLOWER BACKGROUND 
RIGHT I'M HAPPY WITH THAT 
SO I'M NOW GONNA DROP THE PATTERN INTO THE ILLUSTRATOR FILE 
AND WE'LL SEE HOW IT LOOKS 
O. K. WE'VE HAD CONFIRMATION BACK FROM DANIELLA 
SHE'S HAPPY WITH THE DESIGN 
SO WE'RE GONNA RUN WITH THIS ONE 
TO THIS END WE'VE PRODUCED A SAMPLE BOX HERE 
WHICH SHOWS IT IN ALL ITS GLORY 
MARK WAS GIVEN SOME IDEAS BY DANIELLA 
OF HOW SHE'D LIKE THE GRAPHIC DESIGN ON THE BOX TO LOOK LIKE CARPET 
MARK ALSO ALREADY HAD THE BRAND IMAGES TO USE 
WHICH HE COULD ADAPT TO THIS NEW PRODUCT 
HE TURNED TO THE INTERNET TO FIND THE IMAGE HE WANTED TO USE 
IT'S A GREAT SOURCE OF STILLS AND GRAPHIC IMAGES 
BUT BEWARE SOME OF THESE ARE OWNED BY A PERSON OR A COMPANY 
THEY HAVE A COPYRIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO PAY TO USE THEM 
ALTERNATIVELY YOU COULD TAKE YOUR OWN PHOTOS WITH A DIGITAL CAMERA 
THEN YOU'LL OWN THE COPYRIGHT 
ONCE MARK HAD FOUND THE STILL HE WANTED 
HE ADAPTED IT USING EFFECTS IN ADOBE PHOTOSHOP 
IT'S AN EXTREMELY FLEXIBLE TOOL 
HE MADE THE IMAGE GREY MATCHING THE COLOUR HE'D AGREED WITH DANIELLA 
THEN RESIZED AND DUPLICATED IT 
DO YOU THINK THE FINISHED BOX FITTED ITS SPECIFICATION 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME AND MAKE NOTES 
ON HOW WELL MONDI MET THE SPECIFICATION THEY WERE GIVEN 
THE FIRST CONSIDERATION WAS PROTECTING THE FLOWERS 
THIS MONDI ACHIEVED BY DESIGNING A CONE SHAPED INNER SECTION 
THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE FLOWERS IN TRANSIT 
THE HAND HOLES THEY PUT IN WOULD MAKE THE FLOWERS EASY TO TAKE OUT 
THE POP OUT CORNERS OF THE CONE MADE IT STRONGER 
MARK THE GRAPHIC DESIGNER KEPT TO BUNCHES' EXISTING STYLE 
USING THE SAME TYPEFACE AND COLOUR FOR THE WRITING 
BUT HE ENHANCED IT HE MADE THE BOX LOOK LIKE SOMETHING SPECIAL A GIFT 
EXACTLY WHAT DANIELLA ASKED FOR 
AND DID YOU SPOT THE RECYCLED PRODUCT SYMBOL 
THE BOX WILL BE MADE OUT OF RECYCLED CARDBOARD 
IT'LL BE PRODUCED USING A PROCESS CALLED CAM 
COMPUTER AIDED MANUFACTURE 
TAKE A LOOK AT THE SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS SECTION 
OF DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY TWO 
TO SEE THIS IN ACTION 
THERE'S A FILM ABOUT A SIMILAR MACHINE 
TO THE ONE THAT WILL BE USED TO PRODUCE THIS BOX 
AS WELL AS CARDBOARD AND PAPER PRODUCTS 
THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF PACKAGING THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT 
THEY INCLUDE PLASTICS IN VARIOUS FORMS 
AND OCCASIONALLY METALS 
TO MAKE DRINK CANS BUT ALSO IN FOOD PACKAGING 
WATCH THIS CLIP 
ABOUT A COMPANY THAT PRODUCES ALUMINIUM TOPS FOR YOGHURTS 
TAKE NOTES ON THE PRODUCTION PROCESS AS YOU WATCH 
IT ALL STARTS IN THE COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN UNIT 
WHICH WAS SET UP A YEAR AGO 
THEY'RE USING APPLE MACS TO GENERATE DESIGNS 
CUSTOMERS CAN SEND THEIR DESIGNS DIRECT ON AN I. S. D. N. LINE 
THE BUSINESS HAS INCREASED FROM ONE MILLION TURNOVER TEN YEARS AGO 
TO FIFTEEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LAST YEAR 
THE DESIGN AS YOU CAN SEE HERE ENDS UP ON A PROOF 
IF THAT'S ACCEPTED IT'S MADE INTO A FLEXIBLE POLYMER PLATE 
READY FOR THE PRINTING PROCESS WHICH HAPPENS DOWNSTAIRS 
THEIR STAPLE PRODUCT IS ALUMINIUM 
IT'S BROUGHT IN FROM HOLLAND AND ITALY 
AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE PAYING AROUND THREE THOUSAND A TONNE 
HERE YOU CAN SEE THE PRINTING PROCESS 
THE COLOURS THERE ON THE FLOOR 
THAT ARE GOING ONTO THIS PARTICULAR STRIP OF ALUMINIUM 
IT'S KNOWN AS A FLEXOGRAPHIC PROCESS 
YOU END UP WITH A RAISED IMAGE 
WHICH IS THEN ETCHED ONTO THE ALUMINIUM 
ONE COLOUR IS APPLIED FOR EACH OF THE BAYS THAT YOU CAN SEE HERE 
BUT THE STRIP OF ALUMINIUM RUNS THROUGH TOO QUICKLY 
TO CHECK THE DESIGN BY EYE BY THE NAKED EYE 
HERE YOU CAN SEE A STROBING MACHINE 
THAT SLOWS THE IMAGE DOWN SO IT CAN BE CHECKED 
IT'S BACKED UP BY A COMPUTER SCREEN 
WHICH SHOWS THAT THE PRINTING MACHINERY 
IS ACTUALLY HITTING THE RIGHT TARGET 
THE COMPANY IS THE MARKET LEADER IN THE PROCESS 
THEY HAVE AROUND SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE MARKET IN THE U. K. 
THE PRINTED PRODUCT ENDS UP BACK ON AN ALUMINIUM REEL 
READY TO BE TAKEN NEXT DOOR 
HERE NEXT DOOR YOU CAN SEE THE PUNCHING OUT MACHINES 
THE END USE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS 
ARE GENERALLY YOGHURTS CREAMS AND DESSERTS 
THE BY PRODUCT OF WASTE ALUMINIUM IS VERY IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE THEY CAN GET PAID 
ANYTHING UP TO FIVE HUNDRED A TONNE WHEN IT'S SOLD ON 
THE SPECIALITY OF THE BUSINESS IS THEY CAN DO SHORTER RUNS 
AROUND FORTY THOUSAND TOPS FOR PRODUCTS WITH A LIMITED MARKET LIFE 
HERE IS SOME OF THE WORKFORCE PACKING UP 
THEY EMPLOY ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY PEOPLE IN TOTAL 
THE ALUMINIUM YOGHURT TOPS WERE DESIGNED USING C. A. D. 
COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN 
THE DESIGNS WERE THEN SENT VIA I. S. D. N. TO THE FACTORY 
AT THIS POINT THERE WAS CAREFUL STOCK CONTROL 
TO MAKE SURE SUFFICIENT MATERIALS WERE AVAILABLE 
THE TOPS WERE PRINTED BY FLEXOGRAPHY 
WHERE A CYLINDRICAL PLASTIC POLYMER OR RUBBER PLATES 
PRINT ONTO THE METAL FOIL 
DIFFERENT COLOURS WERE PRINTED USING SEPARATE PLATES 
THE PRINTING OF THE LIDS HAD TO MEET QUALITY CONTROL DEMANDS 
QUALITY CONTROL IS A SERIES OF CHECKS CARRIED OUT ON A PRODUCT 
TO ENSURE IT ACHIEVES A SPECIFIC STANDARD 
IN THIS CASE 
IT INVOLVED USING A STROBE LIGHT AND A COMPUTER 
TO MONITOR THE REGISTRATION MARKS OF EACH COLOUR 
IN THE OVERLAY PRINTING PROCESS 
A DIE CUTTING MACHINE PUNCHED OUT BATCHES 
OF FORTY THOUSAND ALUMINIUM DISCS AT A TIME 
FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY ALL THE EQUIPMENT HAD GUARDS 
AND THE MACHINISTS WORE PROTECTIVE CLOTHING 
IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT THE PRODUCT MET QUALITY ASSURANCE 
THIS MADE SURE THAT QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS 
WERE MET THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS 
THE PRODUCT HAD TO MEET THE BRITISH STANDARD 
MANUFACTURERS WHO MEET THIS 
ARE AWARDED THE BRITISH STANDARD KITEMARK 
THE KITEMARK TELLS THE CONSUMER 
IT HAS BEEN TESTED AGAINST THE NATIONALLY RECOGNISED STANDARD 
AN IMPORTANT ACT TO REMEMBER IS THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT 
THIS TRIES TO PREVENT THE SALE OF HARMFUL OR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS 
GRAPHIC MECHANISMS ARE AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF GRAPHIC PRODUCTS 
ALL MECHANISMS TRANSFER MOTION 
THEY CAN EITHER USE LINEAR MOVEMENT IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
OR ROTARY MOTION IN A CIRCLE 
AN OSCILLATING OR SWINGING MOTION 
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AROUND A PIVOT 
THESE ARE POPULAR IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS 
HERE'S A PULL TAB MECHANISM IN USE 
AS THE PULL TAB IS PULLED 
THE CHARACTER MOVES ALONG ON HIS BICYCLE 
THE PICTURE WORKS USING LEVERS AND LINKAGES 
THE SLIDE WHICH THE CHILD PULLS 
LINKS TO THE END OF A LEVER WITH A LOOSE PIVOT 
A GROOVE ALLOWS THE SLIDE END TO ADJUST 
PUSHING THE BOTTOM SLIDE IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
HIDDEN BY A LINKAGE THERE'S A SECOND GROOVE AT THE TOP 
WHICH ALLOWS THE TOP SLIDE TO LIFT UP AND DOWN SLIGHTLY 
WHY NOT HAVE A GO AT DESIGNING A MECHANISM FOR THIS PAGE 
THIS PULL TAB WORKS USING A SLIDE WHICH THE CHILD PULLS 
THIS IS JOINED BY A LOOSE LINKAGE 
TO A ROUND PIECE OF CARD WITH A FIXED PIVOT IN THE CENTRE 
THE CHARACTER'S ARM IS ATTACHED TO THIS PIECE 
WHEN THE SLIDE IS PULLED 
THE ARM ROTATES ON THIS CIRCULAR PIECE OF CARD 
ONE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF ALL GRAPHIC PRODUCTS IS ADVERTISING 
THIS COMMUNICATES AN IMAGE FOR A PRODUCT 
AND ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO BUY THE PRODUCT 
WHICH INCREASES SALES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY PROFITS 
ADVERTISING ALSO ENHANCES THE AESTHETICS OF THE PACKAGING 
A SIMPLE WAY OF DOING THIS IS TO ADD A LOGO 
THIS GIVES THE PRODUCT A DISTINCTIVE LOOK OR IMAGE 
THE NEXT CLIP LOOKS AT THE DESIGN OF THE LOGO FOR THE CLUB CREAM 
WHEN CREAM STARTED FOUR YEARS AGO 
IT WAS SIMPLY A SATURDAY NIGHT OUT AT A CLUB IN LIVERPOOL 
SINCE THEN IT'S EXPANDED INTO A MINI EMPIRE 
WITH A RANGE OF MERCHANDISE CLOTHING A BAR 
AND NOW THIS SERIES OF SPECIALLY PACKAGED CLUB C. D.'S 
THE PACKAGING WAS JUST DREAMT UP 
AGAIN OUT OF HAVING SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
BEING FIRST AND HAVING SOMETHING NEW WHICH HADN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE 
UM BUT ALSO QUITE FUNKY 
YOU KNOW TO REPRESENT THE REAL SORT OF 
YOU KNOW THE COLOURFUL SIDE 
USUALLY IT'S DAVID BOWIE AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT 
WHO HAVE SPECIAL PACKAGING 
SO WE THOUGHT IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM WHY NOT FOR US 
PLUS IT'S GOOD FOR THE BEACH 
WHEN WE WERE ORIGINALLY BRIEFED 
DARREN WANTED SOMETHING REALLY CORPORATE 
SO WE WENT AWAY AND BASICALLY LOOKED AT THE LOGOS WE REALLY ADMIRED 
WE WANTED SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY QUITE MINIMAL 
REALLY SMOOTH A REALLY STRONG UNIT 
WE EVENTUALLY CAME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST A CROSS BETWEEN 
THE BLACK AND WHITE YIN YANG LOGO 
AND A JAPANESE CAR MANUFACTURER'S LOGO 
IT'S REALLY CORPORATE AND IT CAN LAST FOR YEARS 
WE WANTED TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME 
BUT ALSO LOOKED QUITE FUTURISTIC 
WE DELIBERATELY DESIGNED THIS 
SO IT WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING TOO SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CREAM 
IT'S REALLY UP TO THE PUBLIC TO TAKE THIS HOME 
AND MAKE THEIR OWN MIND UP 
WE DIDN'T HAVE A PARTICULAR MESSAGE 
THAT WE WANTED PEOPLE TO THINK WHEN THEY GOT THIS 
CERTAINLY NOTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT CREAM 
WE DECIDED THAT 
IF WE CAME UP WITH SOMETHING REALLY TACTILE 
THAT FELT REALLY NICE AND ORGANIC 
IT'D BE QUITE A NICE CHANGE 
FROM THE NORMAL REALLY HARD PLASTIC C. D. CASES THAT YOU GET 
SO WE WENT DOWN THE ROUTE OF LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS QUITE SOFT 
AND FELT REALLY TACTILE 
BORN SLIPPY BY UNDERWORLD 
IT STANDS OUT FROM THE REST SO MUCH 
IT'S REALLY TOUCHABLE AND REALLY SEXY 
GORGEOUS 
AS YOU'LL HAVE NOTICED 
THE CREAM LOGO FULFILLED A NUMBER OF THE KEY PURPOSES OF ADVERTISING 
THE BRIGHTLY COLOURED TACTILE PLASTIC WITH MINIMAL INFORMATION 
GRABS ATTENTION BY BEING DIFFERENT AND UNUSUAL 
BUT IT ALSO CREATES AN IMAGE 
MINIMAL CORPORATE AND SEXY 
THIS GIVES THE CLUB A DISTINCTIVE BRAND IDENTITY 
WHICH APPEALS TO THE TARGET MARKET IN THIS CASE YOUNG ADULTS 
IT'S EVEN PRACTICAL IF YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR C. D.'S TO THE BEACH 
THAT'S ABOUT IT FOR GRAPHIC PRODUCTS 
SO TO SUM UP HERE'S OUR CHECKLIST 
MAKE SURE YOU'RE ABLE TO USE A RANGE OF APPROPRIATE DRAWING TECHNIQUES 
SUCH AS PLANOMETRIC ISOMETRIC AND EXPLODED DRAWINGS 
ENHANCE YOUR DRAWINGS WITH DETAILS 
LIKE THICK AND THIN LINES LIGHT AND SHADE AND TEXTURE 
PRESENT YOUR FINAL DESIGN SOLUTIONS AS WORKING DRAWINGS 
WITH ACCURATE DIMENSIONS AND A PARTS LIST 
BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE NAME AND DRAW BASIC GEOMETRICAL SHAPES 
SUCH AS TRIANGLES QUADRILATERALS HEXAGONS AND ELLIPSES 
UNDERSTAND HOW COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN C. A. D. 
AND COMPUTER AIDED MANUFACTURE CAM ARE USED IN INDUSTRY 
UNDERSTAND THE FUNCTION AND MARKETING STRATEGIES 
BEHIND PACKAGING 
FOR EXAMPLE PROTECTION 
EASE OF TRANSPORTATION STORAGE 
DISPLAY AND TO GIVE CONSUMER INFORMATION 
KNOW THE BASIC TECHNIQUES USED TO MAKE GRAPHIC PRODUCTS 
LIKE PRINTING PROCESSES CARD CUTTING AND ASSEMBLY 
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW ADVERTISING IS USED 
TO INFORM INFLUENCE AND PERSUADE PEOPLE 
TO BUY ONE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS RATHER THAN ANOTHER'S 
NEVER BURN THE MIDNIGHT OIL 
YOU GET TIRED YOU GET EXHAUSTED 
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS NOTHING SINKS INTO YOUR HEAD 
THAT'S THE END OF GRAPHIC PRODUCTS 
YOU SHOULD BE FEELING MORE CONFIDENT 
ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO DRAW AND MODEL YOUR IDEAS 
AND USE COMPUTER GRAPHICS PACKAGING AND ADVERTISING 
NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO THE SECOND FOCUS AREA FOOD TECHNOLOGY 
FOOD PROVIDES THE ENERGY AND NUTRIENTS WE NEED TO MAINTAIN HEALTHY BODIES 
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ENERGY AND NUTRIENTS 
ARE NEEDED ACCORDING TO THE AGE GENDER AND LIFESTYLE OF A PERSON 
ALL FOOD PROVIDE ENERGY BUT SOME FOODS PROVIDE A LOT MORE THAN OTHERS 
WHAT'S MORE DIFFERENT FOODS PROVIDE DIFFERENT TYPES OF NUTRIENTS 
THESE NUTRIENTS HAVE DIFFERING FUNCTIONS 
FIBRE AND WATER ARE NOT GROUPED AS NUTRIENTS BUT ARE ALSO ESSENTIAL 
TO OUR DIETS WHEN WE GO TO A SUPERMARKET 
MOST OF US CHOOSE FOOD WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING NUTRITION 
AND ITS EFFECTS ON THE BODY DOES THAT MATTER 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU THINK ABOUT NUTRITION WHEN YOU BUY FOOD 
MIKE DOESN'T AND WE'RE OFF TO PUT HIS DIET TO THE TEST 
HE IS AN AMERICAN AFTER ALL 
WHAT SORT OF FOOD DO YOU LIKE EATING 
ANYTHING WITH A LOT OF SAUCE ON IT I HEAR YOU YEAH 
I LIKE TO BURY IT IN SAUCE DO YOU POUR IT ON I AM THE CONDIMENT KING 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF THE LACK OF SALAD DRESSINGS 
I LIKE IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD STRAIGHT IN 
A BAD DIET CAN ACTUALLY WEAR OUT YOUR INTERNAL ORGANS FASTER THAN HEALTHY LIVING 
AND THAT AFFECTS THE WAY YOU AGE 
STICKY BARBECUE MARINADE 
THAT'S SOMETHING I'D DRINK 
TAKE SOME PASTA AND POUR THIS ALL OVER IT M. M. M. 
MIKE MIKE IT'S THE MARRIAGE OF FLAVOURS OH MY GOD 
BE STILL MY BEATING HEART THIS WAS NEVER INTENDED FOR THAT 
THE TEST I'M TAKING WITH MIKE WILL TELL US IF OUR DIET IS AFFECTING THE BIOLOGICAL AGE OF OUR BODIES 
FIRST WE'LL COMPARE WHAT WE EAT 
O. K. MIKE NOW WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT UP 
AND BUY FOOD FOR A WEEKEND AS IF WE'RE JUST COOKING FOR OURSELVES O. K. BREAKFAST LUNCH AND EVENING 
AND SEE IF THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU GO FOR AND WHAT I GO FOR I'M SURE THERE WILL BE O. K. 
LET'SROLL 
I WANT TO GET SOME FRUIT 
EXOTIC FRUITS DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE FRESH FRUIT YEAH RIGHT 
HERE WE GO THIS IS WHERE I GET EXCITED ALL THESE HERBS AND THINGS 
I'M NO SAINT BUT I PAY ATTENTION TO THE FOOD I EAT AND I HOPE MY BIOLOGICAL AGE WILL BE MY REAL AGE

AND THEN GRILLED CHICKEN AND BAM SOMETHING LIKE THAT INSTANT GRATIFICATION 
HERE ARE THE TWO LISTS 
MIKE WANTS INSTANT TASTE FROM LOTS OF SAUCES 
WITHOUT THE NEED FOR MUCH PREPARATION FROM HIS FOODS 
JOHN'S LIST LOOKS HEALTHIER 
HE SEEMS TO BE MAKING SURE HE HAS A BALANCED DIET 
TAKING ON BOARD THE FIVE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES A DAY MESSAGE 
BUT WHAT LONG TERM EFFECT ARE THESE DIETS HAVING 
WATCH THIS CLIP TO FIND OUT 
THE WAY NUTRITION WORKS IS TWO FOLD IT GIVES US FUEL AND BASE SUBSTRATES 
FOR MAKING THE BODY FUNCTION WELL 
IF YOU EAT BADLY YOU'RE MAKING YOUR BODY WORK HARDER AND AGE QUICKER 
CHRONOLOGICAL AGE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN MEASURE YOU'RE BORN AND EACH YEAR YOU GET OLDER 
BUT WE ALL KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING OR BEHAVING YOUNGER OR MUCH OLDER THAN THEIR CHRONOLOGICAL AGE 
THIS PARTICULAR SCAN MEASURES TWELVE BIOLOGICAL MARKERS WHICH WE KNOW DECLINE WITH AGE 
IT'S A SLIGHTLY MORE FUN PART OF THE MEDICAL BIT 
YOU'RE A NICE GUY AND EVERYTHING YEAH YEAH BUT YOU ARE ALL NAMBY PAMBY EAT THIS EAT THAT 
DON'T DO THIS DON'T DO THAT I THINK I CAN KICK YOUR BUTT 
THROUGHOUT THE TEST THE TONE WILL GO ON AND OFF 
THE MACHINE TESTS TWELVE BODILY FUNCTIONS THAT ARE KNOWN TO DECLINE WITH AGE 
LIKE OUR REACTION TIMES AND THE SENSITIVITY OF OUR EYES AND EARS 
IT TESTS HOW SENSITIVE WE ARE AT FEELING VIBRATIONS 
THE CAPACITY OF OUR LUNGS AND OUR MEMORY 
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO BEAT JOHN ON THE MEMORY TEST NOR THE LUNG CAPACITY TEST 
IF I COME OUT AS HAVING A MASSIVELY ELEVATED BIOLOGICAL AGE COMPARED TO HOW OLD I AM 
I'M NOT GOING TO BE A HAPPY CAMPER AT ALL 
THE RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH DETAILED BLOOD TESTS WHICH COVER LIVER AND KIDNEY FUNCTION 
AS WELL AS CHOLESTEROL LEVELS AND ANY MINERAL DEFICIENCIES 
ALCOHOL MAKE A GUESS PLENTY OH YEAH 
UNLIKE THE FITNESS TEST WE ALSO GIVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WE EAT 
AND ANSWER DETAILED QUESTIONS COVERING FOOD RELATED PROBLEMS LIKE INDIGESTION AND FLATULENCE 
THE TEST RESULT WILL JUST COME OUT WITH A NUMBER SO YOU NEED TO TAKE IT ALL WITH A PINCH OF SALT 
I USE IT AS A MOTIVATIONAL TOOL 
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY THOROUGH WORKOUT 
AND THE TEST WILL GIVE US A GOOD INDICATION AS TO OUR OVERALL NUTRITIONAL HEALTH 
MOMENT OF TRUTH MIKE 
I WANNA LEAVE 
O. K. SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THE BIOLOGICAL AGES MIKE YOU ARE THIRTY SEVEN YEARS OLD 
YOU'VE COME OUT AS A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD YOU ARE THE SAME FUNCTIONAL AGE AS YOU ARE BIOLOGICALLY I KNEW IT 
FANTASTIC TOP WORK BUDDY 
JOHN YOU ARE FORTY TWO YEARS OLD YOU'VE COME OUT SLIGHTLY OLDER AT FIFTY NO 
OUCH 
O. K. LYNETTE GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT MIKE HOW COME I'M FIFTY YEARS OLD ACCORDING TO YOUR TEST 
THAT'S A VALID QUESTION YOU'VE CHANGED LOTS OF HABITS 
AND YOU WOULD BE EXPECTING SOMETHING GOOD TO SHOW UP ON THIS 
SO FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY THAT THE AGE SCAN ONLY MEASURES CERTAIN BODILY PARAMETERS 
AND THERE ARE SOME WHERE YOU DIDN'T DO WELL 
AND THERE ARE SOME WHICH YOUR LIFESTYLE HAS AN IMPACT ON 
IT SEEM ALL THOSE YEARS OF BEING A PUNK ROCKER HAVE FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH ME 
MY HEARING AND REACTION TIME WASN'T GREAT AND THOUGH I GAVE UP SMOKING YEARS AGO IT MAY HAVE AFFECTED ME 
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE MY DIET'S THAT BAD 
I WOULD SAY YOUR LIFESTYLE'S BETTER THAN MIKE'S BUT IT'S NOT PERFECT 
MIKE MAY HAVE SCORED WELL ON THE AGE SCAN BUT HE'S IN FOR A SHOCK WITH HIS DIET AND BLOOD TEST RESULTS 
MICHAEL YOUR DIET TO QUOTE MY NUTRITIONIST THE WORST HE HAS SEEN IN MONTHS 
YOUR GUT ISN'T WORKING WELL IT'S NOT BEING EFFICIENT ANY MORE 
AND SO YOU'RE SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL A CHRONIC MALNUTRITION 
THAT'S SERIOUS POOR DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION ARE COMPROMISING THE LITTLE NUTRITION MIKE IS GETTING 
HE'S IN BIG TROUBLE IF HE DOESN'T CHANGE FAST AND IT GETS WORSE 
THERE'S A LOT OF ALCOHOL IN YOUR DIET IN THE WORST WAY POSSIBLE BINGE DRINKING 
YOU'RE DRINKING ALCOHOL INSTEAD OF EATING 
THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR YOUR BODY AND IT'S BEGINNING TO SAY I'VE HAD ENOUGH THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
ALCOHOL'S EMPTY CALORIES IT USES UP A LOT OF VITAMINS AND MINERALS 
IN ORDER TO DETOXIFY THE BODY SO YOU'RE KIND OF LEECHING YOUR BODY 
YOU ARE SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR AN EARLY HEART ATTACK GOUT 
OTHER NUTRITIONAL PROBLEMS A GUT DISORDER 
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE LATER ON 
JOHN EVEN IF YOUR DIET IS NOT PERFECT YOUR GUT IS WORKING FINE 
THAT CLIP SHOWED THE DIFFERING DIETS WERE HAVING A SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM EFFECT 
MIKE'S HIGH CHOLESTEROL HARD TO DIGEST DIET 
IS DAMAGING HIS BODY 
NOW YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF DIFFERENT DIETS 
YOU CAN EXPLORE HOW EACH NUTRIENT CAN HELP MAINTAIN HARMONY WITHIN THE BODY 
THE MOST COMMON SOURCES OF STARCHY FOODS ARE POTATOES 
RICE AND GRAINS USED TO MAKE PASTA AND BREAD 
THESE FORM THE BASIS OF DIETS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 
SUGARS LIKE GLUCOSE AND SUCROSE 
ARE ANOTHER QUICK RELEASE ENERGY SOURCE 
FATS PROVIDE US WITH SLOW RELEASED ENERGY INSULATION 
AND TRANSPORT FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS AROUND THE BODY 
NEVER MAKE THE MISTAKE OF SUGGESTING THAT FATS SHOULDN'T BE EATEN AT ALL 
AS THEY'RE ESSENTIAL FOR THE HEALTHY FUNCTIONING OF THE BODY 
THEY'RE FOUND IN DAIRY PRODUCTS FISH MEAT SEEDS AND NUTS 
FATS FALL INTO TWO GROUPS 
THERE ARE SATURATED FATS WHICH ARE MOSTLY DERIVED FROM ANIMALS 
FOR EXAMPLE BUTTER AND LARD OR SUET 
AND MONO UNSATURATED AND POLY UNSATURATED FATS 
WHICH ARE FOUND IN VEGETABLE OILS OLIVE OIL AND SPREADS 
CHILDREN NEED TEN ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS WHILE ADULTS ONLY NEED EIGHT 
FOODS CONTAINING ALL TEN ARE KNOWN AS HIGH BIOLOGICAL VALUE PROTEINS 
SUCH AS MEAT FISH EGGS MILK AND SOYA BEANS 
PLANT FOODS LIKE PULSES NUTS AND CEREALS 
ONLY HAVE SOME OF THEM AND ARE KNOWN AS LOW BIOLOGICAL VALUE PROTEINS 
BEANS ARE A GOOD SOURCE OF PROTEIN PARTICULARLY FOR VEGETARIANS 
AND THERE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY RANGE AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND VARIETIES 
GROWN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 
THIS BEAN MAP GIVES YOU SOME IDEA 
THE SOYA BEAN IS ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL 
MANY PRODUCTS ARE NOW DERIVED FROM THE SOYA BEAN 
BECAUSE OF ITS NUMEROUS BENEFITS 
THE SOYA BEAN HAS AN INCREDIBLE ABILITY 
TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO A SAUCE A SOUP OR EVEN A BEAN CURD 
IT'S SOMETHING WESTERN CONSUMERS ARE FINALLY RECOGNISING 
IN THE PAST SOYA PRODUCTS USED TO BE CONSIDERED CRANKY AND PEOPLE DIDN'T BUY THEM 
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY DEVELOPMENTS IN MAKING SOYA PRODUCTS TASTIER 
MANUFACTURERS ARE RESPONDING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLERGIC TO MILK 
AND WANT AN ALTERNATIVE THAT IS SOYA BASED 
WE DO HAVE CALCIUM ENRICHED DRINKS AND FLAVOURED DESSERTS WHICH ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY USED TO BE 
MANY SUPERMARKETS STOCK A RANGE OF PRODUCTS FROM BURGERS TO SAUSAGES 
TO SHEPHERD'S PIES MADE WITH TEXTURED VEGETABLE PROTEIN 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT SOYA PROTEIN ACTUALLY REDUCES BLOOD CHOLESTEROL 
THIS HAS BEEN RESEARCHED FOR OVER EIGHTY YEARS 
WHEN YOU REDUCE BLOOD CHOLESTEROL YOU REDUCE YOUR RISKS OF CARDIO VASCULAR DISEASE 
WHEN WE LOOK AT COUNTRIES LIKE JAPAN AND CHINA 
CONDITIONS SUCH AS MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS OR BREAST CANCER 
ARE VIRTUALLY NON EXISTENT THE SOYA ACTIVE INGREDIENT 
WHICH IS CALLED SOYA ISOFLAVONES ARE VERY SIMILAR TO OESTROGEN 
WHEN POST MENOPAUSAL WOMEN ARE STUDIED IN THE U. K. 
WHERE SOYA MILK FOR EXAMPLE HAS BEEN ADDED TO THEIR DIETS 
THERE ARE FEWER SYMPTOMS LIKE HOT FLUSHES 
THERE MAY BE A CORRELATION BETWEEN THESE CONDITIONS IN THOSE COUNTRIES IN THE EAST 
AND THE AMOUNT OF SOYA THEY EAT 
IN THAT CLIP YOU SAW HOW EATING SOYA HAS REDUCED CERTAIN HEALTH RISKS 
SUCH AS CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS IN COUNTRIES LIKE JAPAN AND CHINA 
ALSO RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT BREAST CANCER IS NOT AS PREVALENT 
IN EASTERN COUNTRIES WHERE SOYA FORMS PART OF MOST PEOPLE'S DIET 
IN THESE COUNTRIES CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MENOPAUSE 
SUCH AS HOT FLUSHES ARE ALSO REDUCED 
FOR YOUR GCSE YOU NEED TO KNOW THE FUNCTION OF MINERAL SALTS AND VITAMINS 
AS WELL AS THE FOODS IN WHICH YOU CAN FIND THEM 
SO HOW DID YOU DO WELL 
CALCIUM IS NEEDED FOR BONES AND TEETH 
AND IS FOUND IN MOST ANIMAL PRODUCTS 
IRON IS NEEDED TO REPLACE RED BLOOD CELLS 
TO AVOID SUFFERING FROM ANAEMIA AND IS FOUND IN LARGE QUANTITIES IN MEAT AND EGGS 
SODIUM CHLORIDE COMMONLY KNOWN AS SALT 
IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN THE CORRECT LEVELS OF SODIUM IN BODY FLUIDS 
BUT TOO MUCH SALT IS BAD FOR YOU AS IT CAUSES HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE 
NOW HAVE A GO WITH VITAMINS 
VITAMIN A IS NEEDED FOR GOOD EYESIGHT AND HEALTHY SKIN 
AND IS FOUND IN ANIMAL PRODUCTS LIKE MILK AND FISH IT'S FAT SOLUBLE 
VITAMIN D. HELPS ABSORB CALCIUM AND PHOSPHOROUS 
WHICH IS NEEDED FOR BONES AND TEETH 
IT'S FOUND IN MANY ANIMAL PRODUCTS LIKE MILK FISH AND EGGS 
IT'S ALSO FAT SOLUBLE 
AMONGST THE B. GROUP 
ALL B. VITAMINS ARE WATER SOLUBLE AND FINALLY 
VITAMIN C. IS WATER SOLUBLE 
ONCE YOU'VE SELECTED YOUR INGREDIENTS 
YOU NEED TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR UNDERSTANDING 
OF HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER CORRECTLY 
BECAUSE THEY CAN ALSO CHANGE THE FOOD'S STRUCTURE 
FOODS CAN BE MADE MORE INTERESTING NUTRITIOUS OR PALATABLE 
BY MIXING OR TREATING THEM IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
THE NEXT STAGE IS TO MAKE UP YOUR RECIPE TO MANUFACTURE IT 
IN THE COMMERCIAL WORLD CAM COMPUTER AIDED MANUFACTURE 
CONTROLS MUCH OF FOOD PREPARATION 
WEIGHING AND MEASURING IS DONE WITH DIGITAL SCALES OR MIXERS 
WHICH USE SENSORS TO DETECT WHEN THE SPECIFIED WEIGHT IS REACHED 
CAM ALSO CONTROLS TEMPERATURES 
FOR EXAMPLE IN OVENS FRIDGES FREEZERS 
AND EVEN COOLING TUNNELS WHICH TRANSPORT FOOD 
CAM ALSO CONTROLS OTHER ASPECTS OF FOOD PREPARATION 
SUCH AS PORTION SIZES TIMINGS 
P. H. LEVELS HOW ACIDIC OR ALKALINE IT IS 
MOISTURE SPEED OF MACHINERY FOR EXAMPLE IN MIXERS 
LIGHT LEVELS AND METAL DETECTORS 
MAKING SURE THAT METAL HASN'T FALLEN INTO A PRODUCT BY ACCIDENT 
THERE ARE SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF CAM IN USE AT THIS CAKE FACTORY 
MEMORY LANE IN CARDIFF MAKE CAKES OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES FOR SUPERMARKETS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
THE MAIN THREE INGREDIENTS ARE STILL THERE SUGAR EGG AND FLOUR 
WE'RE LOOKING AT FIFTY TONNES OF FLOUR SIXTY TONNES OF SUGAR 
AND THIRTY TONNES OF EGG A WEEK 
THE HOUSEWIFE WOULD MAKE IT WITH ONE THIRD EACH EGG FLOUR AND SUGAR 
OURS NEEDS TO HAVE A LIFE OF FORTY TWO DAYS 
SO WE ADD GLYCERINE WE PUT MORE SUGAR IN AND ADD PRESERVATIVES 
IF I KNEW YOU WAS COMING I'D HAVE BAKED A CAKE 
HOW D'YOU DO HOW D'YOU DO HOW D'YOU DO 
THE HOUSEWIFE WOULD ADD THE INGREDIENTS GRADUALLY OVER A PERIOD OF TIME 
WE TAKE ALL THE INGREDIENTS AND PUT THEM TOGETHER IN A NICE SLURRY 
WE PASS THEM THROUGH THIS MACHINE WHICH ADDS AIR UNDER PRESSURE AND WHISKS IT INSIDE 
LIKE A HOUSEWIFE WOULD BUT IT'S INSIDE THE HEAD AND UNDER PRESSURE 
THE DIFFERENCES CAN BE SEEN 
A DEAD MIXTURE OF INGREDIENTS AND A NICE FLUFFY CAKE BATTER 
THAT'S WHAT THE HOUSEWIFE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR IN HER MIX 
THE BATTER IS PIPED THROUGH INTO THE DEPOSITING MACHINE 
IF WE'D KNOWN YOU WERE COMING WE'D HAVE BAKED A CAKE 
HOW D'YOU DO HOW D'YOU DO 
HERE THE BATTER IS TRANSFERRED TO THE TINS AND THEN INTO THE OVEN 
WE WORK TO GIVE A GRADUAL BAKE 
MEANING THE OVEN BUILDS UP SLOWLY SO WE GET A NICE EVEN RISE 
AND THEN WE SET IT AT THE BACK OF THE OVEN 
WE MAKE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND AN HOUR WHICH IS SOMETHING IN THE ORDER OF FIVE MILLION A YEAR 
IF WE'D HAVE KNOWN YOU WERE COMING 
WE'D HAVE BAKED A CAKE HOW D'YOU DO HOW D'YOU DO 
THE SPONGES ARE SPLIT AND CREAMED OR JAMMED DEPENDING ON THE VARIETY 
AND THEN TOPPED WITH CREAM AND COCONUT 
WE PLACE THE CHERRY ON THE TOP BY HAND SO A LOT OF THOUGHT 
GOES INTO WHAT THE CUSTOMER ACTUALLY WANTS AND APPRECIATES 
WE TRY TO MAKE THE CAKE AS INDULGENT AS POSSIBLE SO IT'S A REAL TREAT 
WE USE TWENTY TONS OF CHOCOLATE AND ABOUT FIFTEEN TONS A WEEK OF JAM 
WHICH IS QUITE A LOT AND TOO MANY CHERRIES TO COUNT 
WRITE DOWN THE DIFFERENT USES OF CAM COMPUTER AIDED MANUFACTURE 
NOTING THE MACHINE CONTROLLED AND ITS TASK 
WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY STORES IN THE U. K. AND IRELAND 
THE DOMINO'S PIZZA GROUP IS A MASTER FRANCHISE 
IT SUPPORTS ITS FRANCHISEES WITH A NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS 
INCLUDING DOUGH PRODUCTION INGREDIENTS AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASING 
AND TRAINING OPERATIONS 
THIS IS DONE BY A TEAM OF OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY STAFF 
ONE OF DOMINO'S PIZZA GROUP'S PRIMARY SUPPORT FUNCTIONS TO ITS FRANCHISEES 
IS ITS MANUFACTURE OF DOUGH BALLS WHICH WILL FORM PIZZA BASES 
PRODUCING NINETY THOUSAND DOUGH BALLS A DAY 
THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS IS SPLIT INTO THREE AREAS 
THE FIRST ONE IS WASHING THE EQUIPMENT WHICH THE DOUGH GOES INTO 
THE SECOND AREA IS THE MANUFACTURE OF THE DOUGH PRODUCT 
AND THE THIRD AREA IS THE CHILLED AREA WHERE THE DOUGH WILL BE STORED 
READY TO BE SHIPPED AND LOADED 
THE DOUGH PREPARATION AREA 
IS WHERE THE MANUFACTURERS OF DOUGH PRODUCTS WEIGH THE INGREDIENTS 
WE MIX THOSE TO MAKE THE DOUGH PRODUCTS 
THEY ARE THEN PUT INTO A DIVIDER 
WHICH PORTIONS THE DOUGH TO THE DIFFERENT SIZES READY FOR THE STORE 
EACH STAGE THAT'S USED THE EQUIPMENT IS APPROPRIATE 
BECAUSE WE NEED TO PRODUCE THE PRODUCT 
THE SCALES ARE THERE FOR WEIGHING INGREDIENTS 
THE MIXERS ARE THERE TO MIX THE DOUGH TO THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY 
THE DIVIDER IS IN PLACE SO THAT WE PORTION THE CORRECT SIZES 
FOR THE PRODUCT THAT WE'RE MANUFACTURING 
AND THE MOULDER AND THE ROUNDERS ARE THERE TO SHAPE THE DOUGH 
READY TO GO INTO THE TRAYS 
THE CRITICAL CONTROL POINTS IN THE PROCESS ARE 
THE TEMPERATURE OF THE PRODUCT 
THE RIGHT VOLUME OF INGREDIENTS AND WEIGHTS 
THE PLACEMENT WHICH IS PRESENTATION FOR THE CUSTOMER 
FOR THEM TO EASILY HANDLE THE PRODUCT 
AND EACH STAGE IS CRITICAL TO THE END PRODUCT ITSELF 
IN THE PREPARATION AREA 
THE WASHING OF THE DOUGH BALL TRAYS AND THE CONVEYOR BELT 
ARE BOTH CONTROLLED BY CAM COMPUTER AIDED MANUFACTURE 
AS IS THE WHOLE PROCESS OF DOUGH MANUFACTURE 
FIRST THE COMPUTER CONTROLS THE WEIGHING MACHINE 
USING METRIC SCALES IT ENSURES SIZE PORTION CONTROL 
SO THAT THE MAIN INGREDIENTS PRECISELY MATCH THE RECIPE 
THE MIXER MAKES SURE THE DOUGH BALLS ARE THE CORRECT CONSISTENCY 
A DOUGH DIVIDER SPLITS THE MIXTURE INTO PRE DETERMINED PORTION SIZES 
FINALLY A MOULDER SHAPES THE DOUGH BALLS ONTO TRAYS 
THESE ARE PLACED IN A TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED CHILLED STORAGE AREA 
TO AWAIT SHIPPING AND LOADING 
FOOD MANUFACTURE IS ABOUT PRODUCING FOOD THAT IS 
MICRO ORGANISMS ONLY NEED WARMTH MOISTURE AND FOOD TO FEED OFF 
IN ORDER TO MULTIPLY RAPIDLY 
THERE ARE THREE MAIN TYPES OF MICRO ORGANISMS 
YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT 
COMING UP IS A CLIP ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY 
AT A DOMINO'S PIZZA MANUFACTURING PLANT 
AND KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED 
AS NOT ALL OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY MENTIONED 
IN THE PRODUCTION OF DOUGH BALLS FOR ITS THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FRANCHISE STORES 
DOMINO'S PIZZA GROUP HAS A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY AND IN HOUSE HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS 
THAT MUST BE MET 
ALL THE GUYS WHO WORK IN PRODUCTION HAVE TO WEAR A CLEAN GARMENT EVERY DAY 
THEY HAVE TO WASH THEIR HANDS WHERE DIRECTED AND WEAR HAIR COVERINGS 
AND IF THEY'VE GOT BEARD GROWTH THEY NEED TO COVER THAT AS WELL 
IF THEY HAVE A CUT THEY HAVE TO USE A BLUE METAL DETECTABLE PLASTER 
NO JEWELLERY IS TO BE WORN AT ALL APART FROM A PLAIN BAND 
THEY ALL WEAR SAFETY WELLINGTONS TO PROTECT THEM 
THE TRAYS OF DOUGH PASS THROUGH A METAL DETECTOR 
AND WE HAVE TO CHECK THAT EVERY HOUR WITH SPECIAL TEST PIECES 
WITH THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF METAL IN THEM WE CHECK THAT EVERY HOUR 
IF ANYTHING SHOULD BE DETECTED 
THE BELT ON THE METAL DETECTOR STOPS COMPLETELY 
AND WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT TRAY OUT PUT IT INTO ANOTHER ONE 
AND PUT IT THROUGH AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO METAL IN THERE AT ALL 
HEALTH AND SAFETY IS ALSO A REQUIREMENT IN DELIVERY 
WE START WITH RISK ASSESSMENT 
RISK ASSESSMENT IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY HAZARDS 
AND LOOK AT WAYS TO CONTROL THAT HAZARD 
HAZARDS CHANGE ALL THE TIME THEY CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS A MARK IN THE ROAD 
OR AS SILLY AS A NIGHTCLUB THAT HAPPENS TO EMPTY WHEN WE DELIVER 
AND WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM 
DUE TO THE DOUGH BEING A LIVE PRODUCT THERE ARE CERTAIN SPECIFICATIONS THAT MUST BE MET 
FOR THE DELIVERY VEHICLES 
THE VEHICLES MUST BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A TEMPERATURE SO WHEN WE SPECIFY THE SPECIFICATION FOR THE LORRY 
WE'LL ASK FOR FRIDGES FOR INSULATED BODIES FOR TAIL LIFTS TO HELP DELIVERIES 
TO ASSESS THE DOUGHBALL MAKING PROCESS INITIALLY 
DOMINO'S PIZZA CARRIED OUT A RISK ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS 
AND WORK OUT WHAT HEALTH AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS THEY NEEDED TO TAKE 
THEY DECIDED THEY NEEDED TO 
WHICH CAN EASILY BE SEEN IF THEY FALL OFF 
WHICH CAN EASILY BE HYGIENICALLY CLEANED 
TO MAKE SURE NO METAL HAS FALLEN INTO DOUGH 
AS DOUGH IS A LIVE PRODUCT CONTAINING YEAST 
ITS STORAGE HAS TO MEET CERTAIN SPECIFICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE 
WITHIN THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR A FRIDGE 
FOR DELIVERY PURPOSES 
TEMPERATURE CONTROL IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF FOOD SAFETY THAT DOMINO'S PIZZA HAD TO CONSIDER 
LOOK AT THESE TEMPERATURES ON SCREEN 
THEY'RE CRITICAL TEMPERATURES YOU'RE EXPECTED TO KNOW FOR YOUR EXAM 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME AND WRITE WHY THEY'RE SIGNIFICANT 
HOW DID YOU GET ON 
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THESE BY HEART 
SO NOW YOU'VE GOT A HANDLE ON THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE PROPERTIES AND SOME TECHNIQUES FOR PREPARING FOOD 
YOU'RE READY TO TAKE A LOOK AT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
NEW PRODUCTS FOR THE CONSUMER ARE DEVELOPED FOR DIFFERENT REASONS 
THE NEXT CLIP LOOKS AT HOW A SUPERMARKET CREATES A NEW DISH TO RESPOND TO THESE CONSUMER TRENDS 
AS YOU WATCH PAY ATTENTION TO THE STAGES INVOLVED 
HELLO I'M JULIA GOOD I'M A BUYER AT SAINSBURY'S 
SUPERMARKETS STOCK A HOST OF EXCITING PRODUCTS 
AS BUYERS WE'RE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT TO CREATE AND DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS 
IDEAS FOR NEW PRODUCTS CAN COME FROM A HOST OF DIFFERENT SOURCES 
ONE OF MY FAVOURITES IS VISITING RESTAURANTS 
TODAY WE'RE AT THE BOMBAY BRASSERIE TO MEET ASHOK FROM NOON PRODUCTS A SUPPLIER FOR OUR READY MEALS 
ASHOK HI HOW ARE YOU 
WOW THIS LOOKS GOOD WHAT HAVE YOU ORDERED 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR BEST PRODUCT QUALITY AT THE BEST PRICE 
A PRODUCT THAT FILLS OUR MARKET ASPIRATIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE FEEL OUR CUSTOMERS ARE LOOKING FOR 
THIS LOOKS GREAT VEGETABLE BIRYANI 
I THINK IT'S GOT GOOD COLOUR 
I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE THE BRIEF I HAD 
THIS IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR A VEGETARIAN ITEM 
A COMPLETE MEAL IN ITSELF YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE ENOUGH MOISTURE IN IT 
GOOD QUALITY OF VEGETABLES WOULD IT BE EASY TO REPLICATE THIS NO PROBLEM 
O. K. 
MAKE IT AS GOOD AS IT IS HERE 
IT'S GOOD VERY NICE YES 
NOW SAINSBURY'S HAVE DECIDED TO INCREASE THE RANGE OF THEIR INDIAN MEALS 
WE HERE AT NOON PRODUCTS IN OUR DEVELOPMENT KITCHEN 
ARE GOING TO PRODUCE A VEGETABLE BIRYANI FOR THEM 
WHEN I START ON A DISH I'LL GO INTO MY DEVELOPMENT KITCHEN START WORKING ON A RECIPE 
I HAVE A RANGE OF SPICES AVAILABLE TO ME 
IN INDIAN FOOD YOU HAVE CORIANDER POWER TURMERIC 
CHILLI POWDER EACH SPICE WILL GIVE YOU 
A COLOUR A FLAVOUR 
A TASTE 
BASED ON THAT I WILL MAKE A SAUCE 
WHEN I'M HAPPY WITH THE RECIPE 
I WILL PRESENT THE SAMPLES TO SAINSBURY'S 
NOW LET'S SEE HOW DOES IT TASTE 
WHAT WE EXPECT FROM A VEGETABLE BIRYANI 
IN TERMS OF THE VEGETABLE MIX 
THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE SPICES FRESH INGREDIENTS 
THE RIGHT SEASONING LEVEL 
SPICE LEVEL IS GOOD TEXTURE OF THE VEGETABLES IS GOOD 
EXCELLENT NICE ROUNDED FLAVOUR 
IT'S EXCELLENT WELL DONE GOOD 
WHEN SAINSBURY'S ARE HAPPY AND WE ARE HAPPY 
WE'LL SCALE UP ALL THE INGREDIENTS ALL THE SPICES VEGETABLE 
AND PUT IT INTO PRODUCTION 
SO NOW THE PRODUCT'S BEEN SAMPLED AND APPROVED 
AND HERE IT IS ON THE SHELF 
FIRST THE SAINSBURY'S BUYER LOOKED FOR SUITABLE DISHES 
BY VISITING RESTAURANTS TO SAMPLE THEIR RANGE 
A DISH WAS CHOSEN TO COMBINE VEGETARIAN FOOD AT A REASONABLE PRICE 
ONCE APPROVED THE RECIPE WAS DEVELOPED INTO A FINAL PRODUCT 
WORKING ON THE SPICES FLAVOUR AND COLOUR THEN PRESENTING IT BACK TO SAINSBURY'S 
THE FOOD WAS SAMPLED AGAIN FOR TASTE COLOUR TEXTURE NUTRITION AND INGREDIENT QUALITY 
WHEN SATISFIED THE RECIPE WAS SCALED UP FOR MASS PRODUCTION 
YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT C. A. D. IN THE GRAPHIC PRODUCT SECTION 
OF THIS PROGRAMME 
TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS FOR THE COMMERCIAL MARKET 
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A GO ON YOUR OWN 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME AND HAVE A GO AT SCALING IT UP 
SO HOW DID YOU GET ON 
THIS IS THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS FOR A BATCH COOKING OF ONE HUNDRED CAKES 
FROM THIS IT'S EASY TO SCALE IT UP TO PRODUCE HUNDREDS 
OF CAKES IN VARIOUS FLAVOURS 
O. K. SO THAT'S IT FOR FOOD TECHNOLOGY 
TO SUM UP HERE'S OUR CHECKLIST OF POINTS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER 
FOR YOUR COURSEWORK AND EXAM 
AND THERE YOU GO 
YOU SHOULD NOW BE FEELING MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT 
YOUR GENERAL DESIGNING AND MAKING SKILLS AND 
THE KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED FOR GRAPHIC PRODUCTS AND FOOD TECHNOLOGY 
YOU'RE NOW READY TO MOVE ON TO DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY TWO 
WHICH WILL LOOK AT THE FOCUS AREAS 
WE'LL ALSO BE LOOKING AT THE BASICS OF MECHANISMS 
AND SYSTEMS AND CONTROL THAT YOU'RE ALL EXPECTED TO KNOW FOR YOUR EXAM 
HERE'S A QUICK TASTE OF OUR CASE STUDIES 
WHICH OFFER USEFUL AND TRANSFERABLE SKILLS 
TO GIVE YOU THE FULL ROUND UP OF KNOWLEDGE YOU'LL NEED 
FOR YOUR DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY GCSE 
DON'T FORGET THAT THE BOOK WILL ALSO PROVIDE YOU WITH REVISION EXERCISES 
AND IF YOU HAVEN'T FOUND IT ALREADY 
HERE'S REMINDER OF THE ADDRESS FOR THE GCSE BITESIZE WEBSITE 
OH AND FINALLY GOOD LUCK IN YOUR EXAM
