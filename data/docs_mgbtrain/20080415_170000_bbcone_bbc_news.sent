OFFENDER ALL PERVERTING THE COURSE 
OF JUSTICE RHYS WAS SHOT DEAD ON 
HIS WAY HOME FROM FOOTBALL PRACTISE 
LET'S JOIN MARK SIMPSON NOW WHO IS 
IN CROXTETH 
GEORGE PERHAPS THE MOST STRIKING 
THING TONIGHT WAS THE SHEER SCALE 
OF THAT POLICE OPERATION HERE THIS 
MORNING LET'S TAKE LOOK AT 
LIST OF THE PEOPLE ARRESTED THIS 
MORNING A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD TWO SIXTEEN 
YEAR OLDS TWO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS FOUR 
PEOPLE IN THEIR TWENTIES ONE IN THEIR

PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED THE YOUNGEST 
WAS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOY THE OLDEST 
A FIFTY FOUR YEAR OLD WOMAN ALL TWELVE ARE 
BEING QUESTIONED IN CONNECTION WITH 
THE KILLING OF SCHOOLBOY RHYS JONES 
THE FIRST THING I HEARD WAS THE 
BASHING ON THE DOOR AND PEOPLE 
SHOOTING POLICE POLICE I LOOKED 
OUT THE WINDOW SAW THEM RUSHING IN 
I LOOKED OUT A HALF HOUR LATER AND 
THEY WAS TAKING THE YOUNG LAD AWAY 
THIS AN UNMARKED POLICE CAR RHYS RHYS JONES WAS ELEVEN YEARS WHOND HE WAS 
SHOT DEAD HIS PARENT STEPHEN AND 
MELANIE WON SUPPORT AND SYMPATHY 
FROM ACROSS LIVERPOOL AND 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY BUT FROM 
THE START THEY MADE IT CLEAR ALL 
THEY REALLY WANTED WAS JUSTICE 
SOMEONE NOES WHO'S DONE IT AND I 
KNOW PEOPLE MUST BE FRIGHTENED BUT 
THEY'VE GOT TO THINK THAT THEY 
CAN'T LEAVE THIS KILLER OUT THERE 
IT COULD BE THEIR SON IT COULD BE 
THEIR BROTHER NEXT TIME BECAUSE IT 
WILL HAPPEN AGAIN IF HE'S NOT 
CAUGHT IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN RHYS RHYS WAS SHOT DEAD LESS THAN A MILE FROM 
HIS HOME ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF 
LIVERPOOL HE WAS KILLED IN A PUB 
CAR PARK ON HIS WAY HOME FROM

ATICAL EVERTON SUPPORTER AND A 
WEEKEND AFTER HIS DEATH HIS FAMILY 
WERE GUESTS OF HONOUR AT THE TEAM 
STADIUM HIS FUNERAL HIGHLIGHTED 
THE NATIONAL OUTRAGE AT THE BRUTAL 
DEATH OF SOMEONE SO YOUNG SOON 
AFTERWARDS THIS C. C. T. V. IMAGE WAS 
RELEASED OF A SUSPECT ON A BIKE 
NEAR WHERE RHYS WAS SHOT THEN IN A 
RADIO INTERVIEW IN NOVEMBER 
MERSEYSIDE'S CHIEF CONSTABLE 
SUGGESTED HE KNEW WHO THE KILLER 
WAS 
IF THE N. WHO DID IT IS WAS LISTENING NOW WE'RE CONFIDENT WE 
KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND WE'RE IN THE 
PROCESS OF BUILDING A CASE AGAINST 
YOU SO PEOPLE HAVE TO JUDGE US BY 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DEVELOP OVER 
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS TWO TWO MONTHS AGO POLICE SAID THEY'D 
IDENTIFIED THE TYPE OF BICYCLE USED 
BY THE KILLER AND ANNOUNCED THEY'D 
ALSO FOUND THE MURDER WEAPON BUT 
IT WASN'T UNTIL TODAY THAT 
DETECTIVES SUDDENLY DECIDED TO MOVE 
ARRESTING TWELVE PEOPLE IN ONE 
MORNING MORNING RHYS' FAMILY HAVE DESCRIBED THE 
PAST EIGHT MONTHS AS A LIVING 
NIGHTMARE SO HOW ARE THEY COPING 
TODAY 
O. K. THEY HAVE THEIR DOWN TODAY PERIODS AS EVERYBODY HAS BUT WHEN 
YOU'RE WITH THEM THERE'S SUCH A 
CALMNESS ABOUT THEM AND SUCH A LOVE 
RHYS HAS BEEN A PART OF A VERY 
WONDERFUL LOVING FAMILY 
ONE OF 
THE PROBLEMS FOR POLICE HAS BEEN 
PERSUADING SOME LOCAL PEOPLE TO 
PASS ON WHAT THEY KNOW DETECTIVES 
HOPE THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE 
WELL TONIGHT GEORGE THOSE 
DETECTIVES ARE STILL TALKING TO 
THOSE TWELVE PEOPLE L. THINK IT'S A BIT 
PREMATURE TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED 
HERE TODAY AS A BREAKTHROUGH BUT 
POTENTIALLY POTENTIALLY IT'S VERY 
VERY SIGNIFICANT INDEED 
THANK YOU 
CHARTERED SURVEYORS HAVE JUST 
ISSUED THEIR GLOOMIEST PROPERTY 
WARNING FOR THIRTY YEARS A RECORD 
NUMBER SAID HOUSE PRICES HAD FALLEN 
LAST MONTH IT'S YET ANOTHER SIGN 
OF A FINANCIAL CRISIS GRIPPING THE 
COUNTRY GORDON BROWN MET TOP 
BANKERS TODAY TO TRY TO FIND 
SOLUTIONS OUR ECONOMICS 
CORRESPONDENT HUGH PYM REPORTS 
JOHN VARLEY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF 
BARCLAYS ONE OF THE LEADING BANK 
BOSSES ON THE WAY TO NUMBER TEN 
DOWNING STREET TODAY SIR FRED 
GOODWIN OF ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND 
AND MICHAEL GEOGHAN OF H. S. B. C. WERE 
THERE TOO THEIR AGENDA TO TELL 
THE PRIME MINISTER WHO COULD BE 
DONE TO LOOSEN THE GRIP OF THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH THEY WANT THE 
AUTHORITYS TO RELAX THE RULES 
MAYBE BUYING DEVALUED ASSETS FROM 
THE BANKS TO GET MORE CASHFLOWING 
AROUND THE SYSTEM AND TO MAKE IT 
EASIER TO LEND MONEY TO HOME BUYERS 
AND COMPANIES 
THE BANKS ARE ASKING 
FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS IN TWO WAYS 
FIRST THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AN 
INFUSION OF MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM 
IN OTHER WORDS MONEY INTO THE 
BANKING SYSTEM AND SECONDLY 
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
TO ACTUALLY PURCHASE PRODUCTS THE 
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT TO DO 
EITHER BECAUSE IN BOTH CASES IT 
PUTS THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY AT 
SIGNIFICANT RISK 
PROBLEMS IN THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET ARE ADDING TO 
PROBLEMS IN THE HOUSING MARKET 
SURVEYORS SAY THEY'RE GLOOMIER 
ABOUT HOUSE PRICES THAN AT ANY TIME 
SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THOSE IN SCOTLAND ARE 
THE MOST UPBEAT IN THE EAST 
MIDLANDS THE MOST PESSIMISTIC WE WE FEEL VOLUME SALES HAVE FALLEN BY 
THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY PER CENT FROM THEIR PEAK LAST MARCH 
WHICH WAS A PARTICULARLY BUSY TIME 
IN THE MARKET HOUSE PRICES AT THIS 
STAGE APPEAR TO HAVE FALLEN BETWEEN 
FIVE AND SEVEN PER CENT ACROSS THE BOARD AND 
OBVIOUSLY THE DIFFERENT SECTORS 
SHOW SLIGHT DIFFERENT LEVELS 
BETWEEN THE BOTTOM AND THE TOP END 
ONE ESTATE AGENTSY CHAIN ANNOUNCED 
TODAY IT WAS CLOSING SOME BRANCHS 
IN SOUTH WALES THE DECISION 
BLAMED ON THE CREDIT CRUNCH AND 
WHILE CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN DENTED IN 
THE HOUSING MARKET THERE ISN'T 
MUCH TO CHEER CONSUMERS UP 
ELSEWHERE MANY OF THEIR BILLS ARE 
RISING PETROL FOR EXAMPLE WITH 
OIL PRICES REACHING RECORD HIGHS 
FOOD IS ANOTHER PROBLEM PRICES OF 
MANY GOODS ARE RISING AT THE TILLS 
BECAUSE OF COST PRESSURES IN 
AGRICULTURE AROUND THE WORLD A 
RECENT SURVEY FOR LEADING 
SUPERMARKET OWN BRANDS UNDERLINES 
THE POINT A LOAF OF SLICED WHITE 
BREAD FOR EXAMPLE WAS FIFTY FOUR P. A YEAR 
AGO NOW IT'S FIFTY NINE ORANGE JUICE WAS 
SEVENTY TWO P. NOW IT'S EIGHTY EIGHT A PACK OF BUTTER 
WHICH WAS FIFTY EIGHT P. TWELVE MONTHS AGO HAS 
GONE UP TO NINETY FOUR ALL OF THAT MEANS 
INFLATION IS STILL RUNNING ABOVE 
TARGET TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IT'S ANOTHER SOURCE 
OF IRRITATION FOR CONSUMERS AND A 
BIG ECONOMIC HEADACHE FOR THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND AND THE PRIME MINISTER 
LET'S GET MORE NOW FROM OUR 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT LAURA 
KEUNSSBERG WHO JOINS US FROM 
DOWNING STREET WE SAW THOSE 
BANKERS TROOPING INTO NUMBER TEN 
BEHIND YOU EARLIER TODAY MEAN 
THAT COULD ADD TO THE SENSE OF 
CRISIS COULDN'T IT 
WELL GEORGE 
DOWNING STREET INSISTS IT WAS NOT A 
CRISIS MEETING TODAY AND WHILE THE 
PRIME MINISTER NOW SAYS HE IS AWARE 
OF PEOPLE'S FEARS AND CONCERNS THE 
MESSAGE FROM HERE IS VERY MUCH 
DON'T PANIC BUT HE MIGHT TRY 
HAVING DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING 
SOME OF HIS OWN SIDE OF THAT ONE 
NORMALLY LOYAL M. P. TODAY SAID THE 
GOVERNMENT'S ILL PREPARED TO DEAL 
WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS DAVID 
BLUNKETT THE FORMER LABOUR HOME 
SECRETARY TOLD THE B. B. C. HE THOUGHT 
THEY'D GOT IT WRONG ON THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE AND 
ONE OF GORDON BROWN'S OWN MINISTERS 
LORD JONES HAD TO SWEAR LOYALTY TO 
THE PRIME MINISTER AFTER IT WAS 
REPORTED HE'D BEEN TALKING TO 
BUSINESSMEN ABOUT LEAVING THE 
GOVERNMENT BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION 
BUT GORDON BROWN'S MESSAGE WAS THE 
SAME AND HE INVITED CAMERAS IN TO 
REASSURE PEOPLE THAT HE CAN SHELTER 
THE U. K. FROM THE WORST OF THE 
ECONOMIC STORM 
WE'VE GOT TO SHOW 
PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR 
HOMES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED 
ABOUT MORTGAGES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT THEIR JOBS THAT WE 
CAN ENSURE THAT THE ECONOMY IS SAFE 
FOR THEM OVER THESE NEXT FEW MONTHS 
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ENGAGING IN 
FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE BANKS 
AND BUILDING SOCIETIES 
SO STEADY 
AS SHE GOES FROM GORDON BROWN BUT 
WHAT ABOUT THE OPPOSITION WHAT ARE 
THEY SAYING 
THEY AREN'T BUYING IT 
BOTH THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS AND 
THE CONSERVATIVES SAY THAT GORDON 
BROWN CAN'T BLAME WHAT'S HAPPENING 
IN THIS COUNTRY ON GLOBAL PROBLEMS 
IN THE ECONOMY THEY SAY HE MUST 
TAKE SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITY TOO 
WE HAVE TO PUT OUR OWN HOUSE IN 
ORDER WE SHOULDN'T BE PUTTING UP 
TAXES ON LOW PAID PEOPLE AND 
PUNISHING THEM FOR THE MISTAKES OF 
THE GOVERNMENT AND WE DO NEED 
ACTION TO HELP FIRST TIME BUYERS 
AND TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHO'S 
RESPONSIBLE FOR BANKING REGULATION 
IN THE U. K. AND HOW THAT NEEDS TO 
CHANGE AND THAT'S PART OF THE 
CLEAR ECONOMIC PLAN WE HAVE PUT 
FORWARD 
I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL FORWARD GORDON BROWN IS CLEAR WITH THE 
BANKS THERE CAN BE NO BLANK CHEQUES 
FOR THEM AND THEY HAVE A HEAVY 
RESPONSIBILITY TO BEAR IN FROM 
WHAT'S HAPPENED IN RECENT WEEKS 
ALL OF THIS WITH JUST WEEKS TO GO 
TO THE ALL IMPORTANT ELECTIONS THE 
PRIME MINISTER IS OFF TO THE UNITED 
STATES TO DISCUSS THE ECONOMIC 
PROBLEMS THERE 
THE SHOP WORKERS' UNION USDAW HAS 
CONFIRMED THAT THE MERSEYSIDE CHAIN 
ETHEL AUSTIN IS GOING INTO 
ADMINISTRATION THE CHAIN WHICH 
WAS FOUNDED IN LIVERPOOL IN NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR 
HAS MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED SHOPS AROUND THE 
COUNTRY AND EMPLOYS OVER THREE THOUSAND 
PEOPLE NATIONWIDE AROUND SEVENTY PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THREE SEPARATE 
BOMB ATTACKS ACROSS IRAQ THE MOST 
DEVASTATING ATTACK WAS NEAR COURT 
BUILDING IN THE CITY OF BAQUBAH A 
CAR EXPLODED KILLING FIFTY THREE PEOPLE 
THREE DIED IN CENTRAL BAGHDAD WHEN 
A CAR BOMB TARGETED POLICE PATROL 
AND THIRTEEN MORE PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN A 
SUICIDE BOMBING AT A REST FLAUNT 
RAMADI RAMADI THE TWO BRITISH SERVICEMEN KILLED 
IN AFGHANISTAN ON SUNDAY HAVE BEEN 
NAMED SENIOR AIRCRAFTSMAN GRAHAM 
LIVINGSTON FROM THE R. A. F. REGIMENT 
AND SENIOR AIRCRAFTSMAN GARETH 
KIRKWOOD FROM THE ROYAL AUXILIARY 
AIR FORCE DIED WHEN THEIR VEHICLE 
HIT A LANDMINE IN KANDAHAR PROVINCE 
TWO OF B. A.'S MOST SENIOR EXECUTIVES 
HAVE PAID THE PRICE FOR THE CHAOS 
AT TERMINAL FIVE THEY'RE LEAVING THE 
COMPANY BUT PASSENGERS TRAVELLING 
THROUGH THE TERMINAL ARE STILL NOT 
IN THE CLEAR SIX LEADING INSURANCE 
COMPANIES HAVE SAID THAT IN THE 
FUTURE THEY'LL NOT COVER LOST 
LUGGAGE AT TERMINAL FIVE OUR 
TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT TOM SYMONDS 
IS AT HEATHROW NOW TOM 
WELL GEORGE THREE WEEKS ON AND 
B. A. IS STILL DEALING WITH THE FALL 
OUT FROM THOSE DIFFICULT DAYS AT 
TERMINAL FIVE NOW TONIGHT IT'S 
REFUSING TO CONFIRM THAT IT HAS 
SACKED THESE TWO EXECUTIVES THOUGH 
I UNDERSTAND THEY WERE GIVEN THEIR 
EFFECTIVELY MARCHING ORDERS 
YESTERDAY AND THAT THEY HAVEN'T 
BEEN AT WORK TODAY SO THE PROCESS 
OF RECOVERY FOR B. A. GOES ON NOT 
HELPED IT SEEMS BY THIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY INSURANCE COMPANIES 
TERMINAL FIVE DAY ONE AND BRITISH 
AIRWAYS IS IN MELT DOWN 
WHY HAS 
YOUR OPERATION GONE DOWN IT IT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING 
SO IT CAN'T TELL US AT THE CENTRE 
OF THE CHAOS SENT OUT TO BEBACK S. 
PUBLIC FACE WAS SENIOR MANAGER 
GARETH KIRKWOOD UNTIL TODAY'S 
ANNOUNCEMENT BRITISH AIRWAYS' 
DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS HE HAS BEEN 
WITH THE AIRLINE TWENTY TWO YEARS NOW HE'S 
PAID THE PRICE FOR ITS FAILURES B. A. 
ADMITS STAFF WEREN'T PROPERLY 
TRAINED IN WHAT TO DO OR WHERE TO 
DO IT IN THE EARLY DAYS OF T. FIVE EVER 
SINCE CHIEF EXECUTIVE WILLIE WALSH 
HAS AVOIDED BLAMING THE DIRECTORS 
INSTEAD HE'S SAID THIS I'M I'M ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY YOU KNOW 
THE BUCK STOPS WITH ME AND I'M 
DETERMINED TO MAKE THIS WORK BUT BUT WITH BRITISH AIRWAYS AND WALSH FOR 
SOME OBJECTS OF DERISION THIS 
TONGUE IN CHEEK COMPUTER GAME IS 
DOING THE ROUNDS ON THE INTERNET 
HE'S UNDER BIG PRESSURE B. A. 
SHAREHOLDERS ARE ASKING FOR HIS 
PERSONAL ASSURANCE IT WILL ALL BE 
ALRIGHT 
IN THE NEXT MOVE THE ALRIGHT LONG HAUL FLIGHTS FROM TERMINAL FOUR 
TO FIVE DOESN'T GO SMOOTHLY AS WILLIE 
WALSH HAS INDICATED IT WILL THEN 
HIS REPUTATION WILL BE DAMAGED AND 
IT'S POSSIBLE WE MAY SEE A NEW 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE COMPANY AT 
THAT POINT 
AND TODAY ANOTHER SIGN 
OF THE LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN B. A. 
WITH DID BAGGAGE MOUNTAIN IN MIND 
SOME BIG INSURANCE COMPANIES SAID 
THEY WON'T ISSUE NEW POLICIES 
COVERING BAGS LOST AT TERMINAL FIVE 
THEY INCLUDE CHURCHILL DIRECT LINE 
AND PRIVILEGE INSURANCE THEIR 
PASSENGERS CAN STILL CLAIM FROM THE 
AIRLINE UNDER INTERNATIONAL 
AGREEMENTS LITTLE COMFORT FOR 
THOSE LIKE ALEX BATS WHO ARE STILL 
WAITING FOR THEIR BAG 
I FIND IT 
OUTRAGEOUS THE FACT THAT WE DIDN'T 
HAVE OUR LUGGAGE FOR THE TRIP AND 
WE HAVEN'T HAD OUR LUGGAGE BAG 
THREE WEEKS AFTER OUR TRIP UM 
AND THAT WE CAN'T GET COMPENSATION 
FOR THAT IS JUST WELL INCREDIBLY 
FRUSTRATING 
AT LEAST THE LAST WEEK FRUSTRATING OR SO AT T. FIVE HAS BEEN HITCH FREE 
AND PASSENGERS ARE AT LAST STARTING 
TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF THIS FOUR 
BILLION INVESTMENT 
WHICH REALLY ALLOWS BRITISH AIRWAYS 
TO CONCENTRATE ON THE NEXT BIT OF 
THIS CHALLENGE AS YOU HEARD THERE 
MOVING FLIGHTS FROM TERMINAL FOUR INTO 
TERMINAL FIVE INSTEAD OF THAT BEING 
DONE IN ONE BIG BANG THERE IS 
GOING TO BE A PHASE IN OF THAT MOVE 
OF FLIGHTS PLANES AND PASSENGERS 
INTO THE NEW TERMINAL MANY PEOPLE 
WATCHING WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE 
LAST MONTH HAVE SAID THAT'S HOW IT 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE FROM THE 
FIRST FIRST TOM THANK YOU 
AND THE TIME IS COMING UP TO A 
QUARTER PAST SIX HUNDRED OUR TOP STORY 
TONIGHT TONIGHT TWO PEOPLE ARE ARRESTED IN 
CONNECTION WITH THE SHOOTING OF ELEVEN 
YEAR OLD RHYS JONES FROM CROXTETH 
AND COMING UP WE VISIT THE 
JAMAICAN PARADISE THAT GAVE BIRTH 
TO THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS SECRET 
AGENT AGENT LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON 
WHY TOO MUCH TESTOSTERONE ON THE 
TRADING FLOOR COULD BE CAUSING 
UNCERTAINTY IN THE CITY

BAILEY NOW NICK TALK US THROUGH 
WHAT HAPPENED IN COURT TODAY

THE MAIN CHARACTERS APART FROM THE 
TWO DEFENDANTS THEMSELVES ARE BEING 
REFERRED TO AS LETTER OF THE 
ALPHABET TO PROTECT THEM THAT IS 
STANDARD IN CASES OF BLACKMAIL THE 
VICTIM OF THE ALLEGED BLACKMAIL IS 
REFERRED TO AS WITNESS A HE IS A

DEFENDANTS GOT HOURS AND HOURS OF 
VIDEO AND AUDIO TAPE OF WITNESS D. 
MAKING VARIOUS ALLEGATIONS MARK 
ELLISON FOR THE PROSECUTION SAID 
IN RELATION TO THAT LAST ALLEGATION 
THE ONE OF COURSE WHICH HAS 
ATTRACTED ALL THE HEADLINES COUNSEL 
SAID THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT THAT 
ALLEGATION HAD BEEN SLICED TOGETHER 
FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TAPE 
THE TWO DEFENDANTS TOOK THEIR STORY 
AND TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO SALE IT 
TO THE NEWS OF THE WORLD THE MAIL 
ON SUNDAY THE SUN AFTER THAT THEY 
APPROACHED WITNESS A.'S OFFICE 
DIRECTLY THE TWO MEN DENY ALL THE 
CHARGES T. TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO LAST 
A MONTH THANK YOU 
A MAN AND A WOMAN HAVE BEEN KILLED 
AFTER BEING HIT BY A TRAIN NEAR 
HARLOW IN ESSEX IT HAPPENED JUST 
BEFORE EIGHT HUNDRED A M. ON THE LINE FROM 
CAMBRIDGE TO LONDON DO WE KNOW HOW 
THESE PEOPLE CAME TO BE ON THE 
TRACK ON THE LINE 
WELL WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE 
STATION HAS RE OPENED THIS EVENING 
AFTER POLICE HAVE SPENT THE DAY 
RECOVERING THE BODIES OF THE MAN 
AND THE WOMAN FOUND JUST ON THE 
TRACK BEHIND ME THERE STILL 
REMAINS A LOT OF MYSTERY 
SURROUNDING THEIR DEATHS POLICE 
THINK THEY COULD BE BOYFRIEND AND 
GIRLFRIEND THEY SAY THEY FOUND 
C. C. T. V. WHICH SAW THE PAIR PULLING AT 
EACH OTHER ON THE SOUTH BOUND TRACK 
THE TRACK CLOSEST TO ME THEY SAY 
THEY THINK THE MAN COULD HAVE BEEN 
TRYING TO PULL THE WOMAN OFF THE 
TRACK THAT IS A STORY WHICH HAS 
BEEN BACKED UP BY ONE WITNESS WHO 
SAID SHE HEARD RAISED VOICES JUST 
MOMENTS BEFORE NOW WE STILL DON'T 
KNOW WHO THEY ARE THEY HAVE NOT 
BEEN FORMALLY IDENTIFIED WE KNOW 
THAT RELATIVES HAVE BEEN COMING TO 
THE STATION HERE TODAY TO TALK TO 
POLICE NOW THIS ALL HAPPENED JUST 
BEFORE EIGHT HUNDRED A M. THIS MORNING T. DRIVER 
OF THE NATIONAL EXPRESS TRAIN TO 
LONDON SAID HE SAW TWO PEOPLE ON 
THE TRACK HE SAID HE TRIED TO 
BRAKE HE SOUNDED THE HORN THE 
TRAIN CARRIED ON FOR FIVE HUNDRED METRES 
WHERE IT REMAINED FOR TWO AND A 
HALF HOURS IT WAS PACKED 
COMMUTER TRAIN THE POLICE SPENT 
THEIR TIME TALKING TO PASSENGERS 
TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY SAW 
THEY SPOKE TO THE DRIVER WHO THEY 
SAY HAS BEEN DEEPLY DISTRESSED AND 
SADDENED BY THIS 
POLITICIANS HAVE WADED INTO THE 
CONTROVERSY OVER STICK THIN MODELS 
ON CAT WALKS MAGAZINES AND 
WEBSITES THEY ARE CONSIDERING A 
NEW LAW WHICH WOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL 
TO PROMOTE EXTREME THINNESS AS 
EMMA JANE KIRBY REPORTS FROM PARIS 
THERE IS AN ARGUMENT OVER WHETHER 
THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN MEDIA 
IMAGES AND EATING DISORDERS 
TALL GORGEOUS AND OF COURSE 
EXTREMELY SLIM IN THE MODELING 
WORLD OF FRANCE BEAUTY AND 
THINNESS STILL GO HAND IN HAND 
THIS MODEL IS PERFECTLY HEALTHY 
BUT THE WORRY IS THAT OTHER GIRLS 
WILL STARVE THEMSELVES TO TRY AND 
BE LIKE HER IN A FASHION CAPITAL 
LIKE PARIS LOOKING GOOD AND BEING 
SLENDER REALLY MATTERS BUT WITH UP 
TO FORTY THOUSAND ANOREXICS IN FRANCE MANY 
POLITICIANS NOW FEEL THAT ANYONE 
WHO PROMOTES IMAGES OF EXTREME 
THINNESS SHOULD BE PROSECUTED 
M. P.'S SAY IT IS IMPORTANT TO GIVE A 
STRONG SIGN TO SOCIETY THAT THIS 
SKINNY CULTURE HAS GONE TOO FAR 
PEOPLE WHO DO THAT THEY CAN GO TO 
JAIL FOR TWO YEARS AND THEY WILL 
PAY TWENTY THOUSAND EURO PENALTY 
AT THIS 
TOP PARIS MODLING AGENCY WHICH USED 
TO REPRESENT THE FRENCH PRESIDENT'S 
WIFE CARLA BRUNI THE DIRECTER HAS 
SIGNED A CHARTER TO PROMOTE HEALTHY 
BODY IMAGES SHE FEELS THAT IS 
ENOUGH 
THE MODELING BUSINESS IN ENOUGH FRANCE IS REALLY REGULATED ALREADY 
AND I CONCERNING OUR FIELD I 
DON'T THINK WE NEED ADDITIONAL LAWS 
OR REGULATIONS 
THE LAW IS ALSO 
AIMED AT WEBSITES WHICH PROMOTE 
ANOREXIA AND WOULD AFFECT FASHION 
SHOWS AND GLOSSY MAGAZINES WE WE CHANGED THIS ONE BECAUSE HER ARM 
WAS TOO SKINNY 
YOU MADE HER FATTER 
FOR THE MAGAZINE YES 
THIS EDITOR YES BELIEVES REAL WOMEN SHOULD BE SHOWN 
ON THE FRONT COVERS 
IT IS A CRIME 
TO PUSH THE NEW GENERATION IN THIS 
WAY IT IS NOT NECESSARILY TO BE 
SKINNY TO BE BEAUTIFUL 
IF THE 
UPPER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT APPROVES 
THE BILL THEN PROMOTING EXCESS 
SIEVE THINNESS IN FRANCE WILL SOON 
BECOME A CRIMINAL OFFENCE 
THE OPPOSITION PARTY IN ZIMBABWE 
CALLED ON PEOPLE TO WALK OUT IN A 
NATIONWIDE STRIKE TODAY IN PROTEST 
OVER THE RECENT ELECTION WHICH 
THEY CLAIM WAS RIGGED BY PRESIDENT 
MUGABE MANY PEOPLE IGNORED THE 
CALL THOUGH WITH SCORES OF SHOPS 
AND BUSINESSES REMAINING OPEN AS 
USUAL ARMED POLICE AND SOLDIERS 
WERE ON HIGH ALERT FOR ANY POSSIBLE 
DISTURBANCES HERE THE TRADE 
MINISTER LORD JONES SAYS HE WILL 
CONTINUE TO GIVE GORDON BROWN ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
SUPPORT DESPITE CONFIRMING HE WILL 
QUIT BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION 
THERE HAD BEEN CLAIMED THAT THE 
FORMER C. B. I. CHIEF WANTED TO STAND 
DOWN BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BACK 
LABOUR A NINETY THREE YEAR OLD DRIVER WHO 
HAD NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT IN SEVENTY SIX YEARS 
HAS CAUSED SIXTY THOUSAND WORTH OF DAMAGE 
TO TWO PORSCHE CARS JACK HIGGS'S 
FORD FIESTA HIT A PORSCHE CARRERA 
AND THEN FLIPPED OVER ON TO A 
PORSCHE NINE TO ELEVEN AT A SHOWROOM IN THE 
VEAL OF MID GLAMORGAN HE SWEEPING 
UP SOME OF THE BROKEN GLASS WHEN 
THE OWNER ARRIVED

THERE WERE PEOPLE MILLING AROUND 
IT WAS CHAOS THERE WAS A FIESTA 
UPSIDE DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

INTELLIGENCE ONE OF THE 
INSPIRATIONS FOR BOND HE ALSO FELL 
IN LOVE WITH JAMAICA AFTER 
ATTENDING A SUBMARINE WARFARE 
CONFERENCE ON THE ISLAND THE 
CARIBBEAN EVEN PROVIDED HIM WITH 
NAME FOR HIS HERO 
I WANTED A 
REALLY FLAT QUIET NAME ONE OF MY

FINAL YEARS HIS CREATION TOOK ON A 
NEW LIFE AS BOND MOVED FROM THE
