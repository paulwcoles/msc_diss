HELLO WELCOME TO AUGUSTA FOR DAY 
THREE OF THE MASTERS AT THE 
HALFWAY STAGE TWO YOUNG GUNS WITH 
STRANGE NAMES LEAD THE WAY BUT NOT 
FAR BEHIND OUR FOUR ENGLISHMAN AND 
THE BEST TWO PLAYERS IN THE WORLD 
I MADE A LOT OF PUTTS TODAY THAT 
WAS FANTASTIC IT WAS ABSOLUTELY 
AWESOME 
IT IS VERY EXCITING THE AWESOME ANYTHING KEEPING ME IN CHECK IS MY 
FITNESS LEVEL 
I FULLY BELIEVE IN 
MY ABILITY ON THE GOLF COURSE IF I 
PLAY LIKE I HAVE DONE IN THE LAST 
TWO DAYS I WILL GIVE MYSELF A 
CHANCE 
NOT DISAPPOINTED L. THOUGHT CHANCE I PLAYED VERY WELL I WAS CHANCE VERY 
HAPPY TO GET IN THE HOUSE FOUR 
UNDER PAR IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER 
BEEN IN TWO ROUNDS 
I DID PLAY VERY 
SOLIDLY OVER THE FIRST FULL DAY I I AM DELIGHTED WITH THAT IT IS A 
GOOD COMEBACK ADDED PUT ME IN A 
GOOD SPOT 
YOU HAVE GOT TO STAY 
PATIENT ON THIS GOLF COURSE 
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN 
AFTER TWO GLORIOUS DAYS THE 
WEATHER HAS TAKEN A TURN FOR THE 
WORSE HERE AT AUGUSTA THE RAIN 
DAMPENED THE GOLF COURSE SOMEWHAT 
AND THE THREAT OF A STORM PRODUCED 
A DELAYED JUST AFTER ONE P. M. OF AROUND 
FIFTY MINUTES DELAY BUT THE SKIES 
HAVE BRIGHTENED AND WE ARE HOPEFUL 
OF NO FURTHER DELAYS 
HERE WITH US IN THE STUDIO ARE KEN 
BROWN AND SAM TORRANCE WE WILL 
HEAR FROM THEM SOON LET'S GIVE YOU 
A FLAVOUR OF THE DAY SO FAR THE 
DEFENDING CHAMPION ZACK JOHN SIMM 
TWO OVER PAR AT THE START OF PLAY 
BIRDIED THE SECOND THIRD AND 
SIXTH 
AND HAD ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AT NINE 
ZACH JOHNSON 
STRUCK IT NICELY 
IT IS THERE 
HE WENT TO TWO UNDER 
PAR FOR THE TOURNAMENT NICK 
DOUGHERTY STARTED ONE UNDER BUT HAD 
A CHANCE TO IMPROVE THAT AT THE 
THIRD 
DOWNHILL A LITTLE BIT THIRD SPEEDY HE HAS DONE IT WELL DONE 
HE WAS STILL TWO UNDER WHEN HE 
STOOD ON THE SIXTH TEE NICELY STRUCK A SPARKLING SHOT UNLUCKY AFTER 
THAT SUBLIME SHOT HE WILL GO TO 
MINUS THREE TIGER WOODS NEEDED TO 
GET GOING ON MOVING DAY THIS WAS 
HIS SECOND TO THE PAR FIVE SECOND 
HE NEEDS A BIG HIGH DRAW HE FUNDED 
DOWNHILL HE IS OFF AFTER IT AND 
WHY NOT THAT WOULD BRING LIKE THAT LED TO A BIRDIE FOR TIGER TO 
NEED HIM TO TWO UNDER PAR WHICH IS 
WHERE HE REMAINS AFTER EIGHT HOLES 
PAUL CASEY STARTED THE DAY ON FOUR 
UNDER PAR HE PARRED THE FIRST AND 
MOMENTS AGO ON THE SECOND THIS WAS 
FOR A BIRDIE IN AT THE BACK DOOR CASEY FIVE UNDER PAR WE WILL GET OUT TO LIVE GOLF AS 
SOON AS WE CAN TO CATCH THE 
LEADERS ON THE FIRST GREEN 
FORTUNATELY IT HAS BRIGHTENED UP 
IT WAS HEAVY RAIN SO THE WHOLE 
COURSE GOT FLOODED OVER IT WILL BE 
A LOT LONGER WHICH SHOULD SUIT THE 
LONGER HITTERS WE WILL SEE SOME 
PLAYERS SUFFERING WITH TOO MUCH 
BACKSPIN 
THE PLAYERS HAD STARTED BACKSPIN BEFORE THE RAIN CAME SO THEY COULD 
NOT ADAPT AND IT IS PRETTY SOGGY AL 
THERE 
A FRACTION MORE WIND TODAY THERE NOT MUCH OUT THERE IT MIGHT GET 
UP LATER THIS AFTERNOON WHEN THE 
LEADERS ARE ON THE BACK NINE TIGER TIGER WOODS HAS STILL NOT MADE A CHARGE 
HE WILL NEED A BIT MORE THAN THAT 
I AM GLAD WE CAME HERE FOR THIS 
WEEK IT WAS WORTH IT TO SEE THIS 
SECOND SHOT ON THE SECOND IT WAS 
MAGNIFICENT SIXTY OR SEVENTY YARDS IT 
CAME DOWN LIKE AN OLD DOG IN FRONT 
OF THE FIRE 
HE GOT A HUGE BREAK 
THIS MORNING BECAUSE HE WAS JUST 
ABOUT TO TEE OFF AT ONE TEN P. M. AND THE 
HEAVENS OPENED HE COULD HAVE BEEN 
STARTING ABSOLUTELY SOAKED BUT HE 
DID NOT HAVE TO START THE OTHER 
PLAYERS HAVE GONE OUT BEFORE HIM 
AND HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY SODDEN 
OTHER CHALLENGERS AT THIS STAGE 
WHO WE ARE YOU EXPECTING TO MAKE CHARGE 
MICKELSON HAS TO MAKE A CHARGE CHARGE HE WAS IN A SIMILAR 
POSITION GOING INTO THE THIRD ROUND 
STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH HIS 
PUTTING IN RECENT WEEKS BUT HE HAS 
BEEN WORKING HARD OUR TWO BOYS 
CASEY IS A GOOD STRONG PLAYER HE 
HAS GOT A CHANCE 
A COUPLE OF EARLY 
CHALLENGERS FOR THE SHOT OF THE DAY 
COMPETITION IF WE HAD ONE THIS IS FOR AN EAGLE NICLAS FASTH 
HOW ABOUT THAT 
THAT IS HOW YOU DO 
IT THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW MUCH 
BACKSPIN YOU CAN GET ON THE BALL 
THIS IS ALLENBY ON THE ELEVENTH 
IT IS 
BACK LEFT AH UP WOW 
IT WAS THE 
TENTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WELCOME H. D. VIEWERS THOSE OF YOU 
WHO HAVE NOT GOT IT GET IT QUICK 
SPECTACULAR PICTURES HERE IF YOU 
GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IT HAVE 
A LITTLE LOOK LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT 
THE PAIRINGS WHICH WILL BE 
FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE AFTERNOON 
WE WILL BE WATCHING TIGER WOODS HE 
IS PLAYING ALONGSIDE ANDRES ROMERO TWO EUROPEANS TOGETHER 
MIKE WEIR THE FORMER CHAMPION WHO 
HAS HAD AN EARLY BIRDIE 
A POSSIBLE RYDER CUP MATCH IN A FEW 
MONTHS' TIME THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE WAITING FOR SOME LIVE PLAY HERE IS TREVOR 
IMMELMAN AT SECOND A LITTLE BIT OF 
RIGHT TO LEFT TO CATCH THE SLOPE 
HE NEEDS EVERY INCH HE CAN CATCH 
TODAY AND THAT IS BOUNDING ON 
DOING QUITE WELL 
NOT BAD AT ALL 
IT IS QUITE AMAZING THE DIFFERENCE 
JUST THAT LITTLE BIT OF RAIN WE HAD 
THIS MORNING L. DIDN'T THINK WE HAD 
TOO MUCH BUT THERE WAS WATER LYING 
EVERYWHERE THEY USED THE SYSTEM TO 
GET THE WATER AWAY FROM THE GREENS A SHORT BUT A PRETTY GOOD AMATEUR CAREER HE EXPANDS IT AWAY THAT 
IS GOOD SOME NICE PAIRINGS TODAY TIGER WAX ONE UP TO THE NIGHT THAT IS SHORT NINTH IT ENDED UP NOT BAD 
NOT GOOD BY HIS STANDARDS BAD THOUGH ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT A VERY 
DIFFICULT CHIP PRETTY GOOD DEFENCE SO FAR FOR ZACH 
JOHNSON IT IS NOT UNDER YET TWO 
UNDER PAR A LOT BETTER THAN MOST 
PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE WERE 
EXPECTING I THOUGHT SOME PEOPLE 
HAD BEEN QUITE UNKIND TO HIM THIS 
WEEK BUT HE IS DOING A GREAT JOB MICKELSON WITH ONE OF THESE LITTLE 
PITCHES AT THE MASTERS HIS THIRD 
SHOT AND THIS TO HIM WOULD BE 
THOUGHT OF AS A RELATIVELY SIMPLE 
SHOT SLIGHTLY UP HILL PITCHING TO 
THE GREEN WHICH IS SLOPING TOWARDS 
HIM SO I FANCY THIS WILL BE PRETTY 
BOLD HE MAY EVEN BE ANTICIPATING SOME 
REVERSE SPIN ON THE SECOND OR THIRD 
BOUNCE LIKE THAT 
HE HAS GOT SOME 
TOUCH HASN'T HE SOME LITTLE TOUCH THERE HE MUST 
HAVE BEEN FIFTY YARDS AWAY A SUPER 
SHOT HE HAS EVEN EXPANDED HIS REPERTOIRE 
QUITE A WHILE AGO HE WOULD HAVE 
TAKEN THAT WAY UP IN THE AIR AND 
TRIED TO LAND IT IN THE HOLE HE 
SQUEEZED IT OUT A LITTLE LOWER 
CHASING IT UP THE SLOPE HE IS 
STILL GETTING THAT'S BEEN THREE 
LEFT HANDERS IN THE FIELD WHICH IS 
FAIRLY RARE THAT SPIN HE HAS 
ALWAYS GOT LITTLE MYSTICAL SMILE 
AS IF HE HAS GOT SECRET THOUGHT SOMETHING THAT ONLY HE KNOWS A BIRDIE PUTT ON THE FIFTH HE HAS A 
GOOD RECORD HERE RETIEF GOOSEN A 
GREAT PUTTER OFF FAST GREENS HE 
HAD A GOOD TOURNAMENT A FEW WEEKS 
AGO HIS FIRST GOOD ONE IN A LONG 
TIME HE IS BACK IN FAMILIAR 
TERRITORY VERY STILL AT 
THE MOMENT A HEAVY ATMOSPHERE HITTING THE BALL NICELY AND THAT NEEDS TO COME IT IS TRYING HE HAS GOT HIS CHEF'S TROUSERS ON TODAY TARGET WITH THE FLAG OUT TIGER IT LOOKS LIKE THE PUTTER VERY DIFFICULT TO PUTT THROUGH THIS FRINGE IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL BUT IT CAN GRAB THE BALL AND SHOOT IT IN ANY DIRECTION I THINK WE HAVEN'T NEARLY GOT THE 
TOP MAN THE TOP TIGER WOODS TODAY 
HE HAS LOOKED LITTLE DISENCHANTED 
THERE BUT HE HAS ALREADY PLAYED A 
TWO WAR THREE CRACKING SHOTS HE 
HAD A VERY GOOD PUTT AT THE FIRST 
HE HAS HAD THREE OR FOUR HOLES WITH 
PUTTS OF UNDER TWELVE FEET NONE OF 
THEM HAVE GONE IN BUT YOU NEVER 
KNOW I THINK HE HAS ONLY HAD FOUR 
BIRDIES FOR THE ENTIRE TOURNAMENT 
ONE EAGLE WHICH IS UNUSUAL AUGUSTA HAS BEEN KIND TO LEFT HANDERS IN PREVIOUS YEARS SIX LEFT HANDERS HIT OFF AT THE 
START OF THE WEEK ONLY THREE LEFT 
THIS IS BRANDT SNEDEKER THE SECOND 
HE IS A BIT TIGHT TO THE TREES HE 
IS JUST PRODDING THIS DOWN THE 
BOTTOM HE IS TUCKED UP BEHIND 
THE TREES ON THE RIGHT HE HAS GOT SOMETHING 
WITH BIT OF AHEAD ON IT 
IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO HIT THE BIG HOOK HERE 
TOO HE IS ON A DOWNHILL SLOPE 
WHICH TENDS TO GET YOU FORWARD AND 
MORE LIKELY TO BLOCK A SHOT ON A 
DOWN HILL SLOPE 
HE IS AIMING 
PROBABLY AT THE RIGHT OF THE BUNKER 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FAIRWAY IT WOULD HAVE GONE ALL THE WAY IT 
FLEW INTO THE BUNKER PLENTY OF 
STRENGTH TO REACH BUT VERY 
DIFFICULT TO GET NEAR THE FLAG HE HE MADE THE COMMENT IN THE PAPER THIS 
MORNING HOW COMFORTABLE HE IS ON 
THIS GOLF COURSE TREVOR IMMELMAN HAS BEEN A GOOD 
PLAYER FROM VERY EARLY AGE L. 
REMEMBER WATCHING HIM PLAY IN OUR 
AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP HE IS STILL 
ONLY IN HIS LATE TWENTIES HE GETS A LITTLE BIT FASTER ON 
OCCASION BUT HE LOOKS VERY 
COMPETENT AND SOLID A THREE WOOD TRYING TO HIT A LOW SNIPE TOOK BOOK BEAUTIFUL DOWN ON THE FLAT UNDULATIONS ARE 
DIFFICULT TO SPOT 
A THE TENTH IS A 
BIG ELEVATED TEE IT DROPS ONE HUNDRED TEN FEET 
IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE CONDORS 
AS WE LOOK DOWN THE HOLE THE TEE 
SHOT IS VERY MUCH DOWN THE HILL 
WITH A TILTING FAIRWAY FROM RIGHT 
TO LEFT IF YOU HIT IT DOWN THE 
MIDDLE WITH A LITTLE DRAW IT KICKS 
DOWN THE LEFT THE SECOND OVER 
THIS BUNKER JUST DECEIVES YOU A 
BIT DECEPTIVE THE LENGTH INTO THE 
GREEN SET UP ON A LITTLE PINNACLE 
A BIG SLOPE FROM BACK RIGHT TO 
FRONT LEFT 
HE HAS PLAYED THE 
HARDEST HOLE OF THE WEEK SO FAR 
VERY TOUGH WE HAVE SEEN A TWO FROM 
ROBERT ALLENBY BUT YOU'RE VERY 
HAPPY TO MAKE A PAR FOUR 
YOU DON'T 
GET THE RUN OF THE DRIVE THAT IS 
WHY IT IS PLAYING SO HARD JUST A SMALL PLATEAU ON THE BACK 
RIGHT HAND SIDE WHERE THE FLAG IS 
BEAUTIFUL SHOT YOU HAVE GOT NO 
IDEA WHAT GOOD SHOT THAT IS 
IMAGINE TRYING TO HIT SIX IRON ONTO YOUR DINNER TABLE JUSTIN ROSE WITH AN IMPOSSIBLE SHOT 
WELL DONE JUSTIN YOU HAVE HAD 
ENOUGH AGGREGATE IN OVER THIS 
CORNER OF THE COURSE AGGRAVATION 
A BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE FOR YOU HE FINISHED THREE TO THREE IT IS GREAT TO SEE HIM PLAYING THE 
WEEKEND HE HAS BEEN VERY EXCITED 
ABOUT SOME OF THAT SWING CHANGES HE 
HAS MADE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF 
WEEKS DISAPPOINTING DAY THOUGH 
YOU EXPECTED MORE THAN THAT CHASED IT UP NOT ANOTHER VERY WELL PLAYED SHOT UNDER THE HOLE FOURTEEN FEET YOU CAN'T 
DO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT 
HE HAS 
HIT THE BALL WITH MORE AUTHORITY 
TODAY A HARD SHOT PLAYING THE UPSLOPE WET SAND HE 
IS THERE FOR THREE TWO PUTTS FOR A 
PAR GOOD TWO FOR WESTWOOD THREE UNDER PAR 
YOU HAVE SPOTTED ONE OR TWO THINGS 
THAT DO NOT SUIT TIGER WOODS HE HE HAS GOT A SPECIAL BALL A LITTLE 
SOFTER THAN HE USUALLY USES HE HAS 
SACRIFICED A BIT OF DISTANCE BUT ON 
A DAY LIKE TODAY ANY EXTRA SPIN ON 
THE BALL PARTICULARLY WITH YOUR 
SHORT IRONS 
THE BALL IS LIKELY TO 
COME SPINNING BACK HERE IS A 
CLASSIC EXAMPLE A LITTLE THREE 
QUARTER SHOT BECAUSE THE BALL IS 
THAT BIT SOFTER HE MAY STRUGGLE AT 
TIMES FASCINATING BACK TO LIVE PLAY WELL THAT IS THE WAY TO GET A FOUR AN INTERESTING YOUNG FELLOW HE HAS 
ACTUALLY GOT A SMILING FACE IS 
THAT BUT TWO SHOT PENALTY 
IT HAS 
BEEN UNUSUAL L. THINK SOME OF THE 
PLAYERS WILL RELISH THE SOFTER 
GREENS THE PRIDE OF WOBURN HE REPRESENTS THE CLUB THEY WILL BE SITTING DOWN TONIGHT 
WITH HOT MUG OF NEED 
WILL ALEX B. 
THEY'RE TELLING STORIES PROBABLY PROBABLY BE THERE DON'T MISS IT IT IS ONE OF THE ANNOYING THINGS 
WHEN YOU PLAY A BETTER SHOT THAN 
THE ONE THAT DOES NOT GET THE 
BIRDIE IN MATCH PLAY THAT WOULD 
ANNOY YOU WANT ENORMOUSLY SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT FOR THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND 
THE NUANCES OF GOLF IN NEVILLE PLAY 
BUT IN MATCH PLAY THAT WOULD BE A 
BODY BLOW NAGEL PLAY HERE IS A THOUGHT WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE 
WE SAW BRUNSON EDITOR ONE YESTERDAY CHIP IT FROM THE TOP TEAR IT IS PROBABLY THE SHOULDER AT THE 
SIDE OF THE GREEN JUST PINCHING IT 
A LITTLE BIT AND IF HE TRIES TO 
PUTT IT HE MAY TRY TO TAKE IT OVER 
THE FRINGE THIS WAY HE WILL BE 
ABLE TO PUT SOME SPIN ON IT AND TRY 
TO GET A LITTLE MORE CONTROL BUT 
HE HAS KNOCKED THAT OVER HE WOULD 
HAVE HAD TO PUTT THAT WAY UP ON THE 
FRINGE HE TRIED TO PULL OFF A MINOR 
MIRACLE THERE HE DID NOT DO IT 
WASH THE GREEN HERE HE JUST 
CLIPPED IT 
EVEN THE GREAT MESS IT UP 
YESTERDAY A MORE SUCCESSFUL 
ATTEMPT BRANDT SNEDEKER ON THE 
SIXTH 
HE HAS GONE DOWNHILL THERE SIXTH THAT WAS FANTASTIC THE STREET HIM 
TREAT HIM 
THE MASTER OF THE SHOT 
QUITE SURPRISING TO SEE HIM CATCH 
IT A BIT FAT 
YES BUT THEY ARE 
NORMALLY PLAYED WITH A BIT OF GRASS 
UNDER THE BALL 
IT IS A NEW JOINT 
LEADER ON THE THIRD TEE WITH AN IRON ONE OR TWO OF THE 
PLAYERS HAVE A CUT WITH THE DRIVER 
TRY TO GET AS CLOSE AS THEY CAN HE 
IS TAKING A MORE CANNY APPROACH STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN TWO VERY SWEET IRONS GOOD POSITION ONE OF THE EASIER PUTTS HE CAN GET ON 
THIS GREEN YES THREE UNDER PAR TIGER WOODS FIGHT BACK WE HAVE SEEN HIM DO SOME MAGIC ON THIS BACK NINE WHAT WAY TO START 
PLAYING THE MOST DIFFICULT HOLE SO 
FAR AND HIT A NICE TEE SHOT A 
GOOD SECOND AND ROLLS ONE IN HE WILL TRY TO SALVAGE HIS PAR HOW ABOUT THAT THAT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN AT UNFORCED ERROR TO MAKE FIVE 
ON THE THIRD HOLE BUT HE MAKES A 
MONSTER KERWOOD PUTT LEFT TO RIGHT 
TO STAY SIX UNDER CURLING PUTT THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE JUST JOINING 
US HE HAD AN IMPOSSIBLE BUNKER 
SHOT AT THE LAST HOLE AND HE HOLED 
IT OUT OF THE BUNKER NOW HE HAS A 
WONDERFUL CHANCE OF ANOTHER THREE 
I FEEL SORRY FOR HIM HE LED A GAME 
FOR THE THIRD TIME AFTER THE FIRST 
ROUND THINGS ARE WARMING UP A BIT NOW PUTTS AND CHIPS GOING IN EVERYWHERE HE WAS GOING ALONG STEADILY 
YESTERDAY UNTIL HE TOOK EIGHT AT 
THE FIFTEENTH BUT NOW HE HAS GONE TWO 
THREE GETTING BACK INTO THE REALMS 
OF RESPECTABILITY HAVE BEEN WORSE 
THAN A FOUR UP THE LAST AND A GOOD 
ROUND TOMORROW THE REPLAY OF ROBERT KARLSSON'S PUTT AT THE NINTH THE EUROPEANS ARE DOING WELL AT THE MOMENT CAN HE EMULATE PHIL MICKELSON ISN'T THAT AMAZING PAUL CASEY AT THE FIFTH FOR A 
BIRDIE HE IS FIVE UNDER AT THE 
MOMENT ALL THE WAY THAT LITTLE BIT OF RAIN HAS TAKEN 
SOME OF THE STING OUT OF THE GREENS 
THE PLAYERS FEEL FREE TO STROKE IT 
STROKE AT A BIT MORE FREELY YES YES THAT WAS SWEET BACK TO THE THIRD THE FINAL PAIR 
AFTER PLAYING CONSERVATIVELY UP THE 
FAIRWAY WE HAVE SEEN THE BALL SPIN BACK 
VICIOUSLY WHEN PITCHED UP NEAR THE 
FLAG TIGER WOODS DID WE HAVE SEEN 
A COUPLE OF OTHERS DO THE SAME THAT HAS HELD ITS GROUND O. K. NOT BRILLIANT BUT NOT BAD THE APPLAUSE TELLS IT ALL WILL THIS BE QUICK OR WILL HE HE'S DOWN HE WAS QUICK THE QUEEN MIGHT TAKE IT AWAY THE GREEN NO GREAT SHOT THEY PUT THE TEE 
FORWARD A BIT TODAY ON THIS FOURTH 
HOLE IT IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT CLOSER 
PAUL CASEY IS MOVING UP EVERYTHING 
IS GOING ALONG QUITE NICELY FOR THE 
LEADERS AT THE TOP OF THE TABLE 
BUT WHAT OMINOUSLY TIGER WOODS HAS 
SLIPPED INTO VIEW RATHER 
OMINOUSLY HE LOOKS A DIFFERENT 
PLAYER TODAY THAN THE PREVIOUS TWO 
YOU SEE MANY DRAMATIC CHANGES OVER 
THE SECOND NINE HOLES PEOPLE 
COMING FROM SIX OR SEVEN BEHIND 
HOME IN THIRTY DOING INCREDIBLE THINGS 
IAN WOOSNAM MANY THOUGHT ANGEL 
CABRERA WOULD DO BETTER THIS WEEK 
BUT HE WILL NOT WIN SANDY LYLE AND KJ CHOI POPPING UP 
THE FIELD AT THE MOMENT PROPPING 
UP I THOUGHT RETIEF GOOSEN WOULD DO 
VERY WELL I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE 
HIM PLAYING NICELY WHEN HE IS IN FULL FLOW HE LOOKS 
VERY ERROR VERY ELEGANT JUSTIN JUSTIN ROSE HE MUST HAVE PULLED IT A BIT AND 
CAUGHT THE TREE BECAUSE THAT WAS 
FROM A LONG WAY BACK ON THE EIGHTEENTH LOOKING BACK ON THE THIRTEENTH FAIRWAY THERE ARE VERY FEW STANDS HERE PHIL MICKELSON WAS UNLUCKY NOT TO 
GET A BIT OF BACKSPIN ON THAT SHOT 
INTO THE GREEN ALWAYS GOOD TO GET TO THREE ON THIS DIFFICULT FOURTH A LONG BIRDIE CHANCE FOR TREVOR IMMELMAN A BIG SWING FROM THE LEFT TWO PUTS WOULD BE GOOD PUTTS A BIT MORE SPEED IT WAS THERE THE RAIN HAS TAKEN A BIT OF STING 
OUT OF THE GREEN IT HAS MADE IT A 
BIT MORE COMFORTABLE 
YES THEY CAN 
TAKE A BREATH THE DAY TODAY 
THEY ARE NOT SCARED OF THE BALL 
FINISHING FOUR OR FIVE FEET PAST IT IS HARD WHEN YOU HAVE PLAYED ALL 
WEEK LITTLE TENTATIVE IN YOUR MIND HE BARELY TOUCHED THAT GOOD LINE GOOD START HE LOOKS VERY COMFORTABLE BRANDT 
SNEDEKER AS PETER SAID HE LOOKS 
LIKE HE IS ENJOYING HIMSELF THE 
RELIEF 
IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE RELIEF IF YOU CAN SET OUT TO ENJOY IT 
LOOKING BACK UP THE HILL AT THE 
ELEVENTH THE FLAG TODAY IT IS AT THE BACK 
LEFT IN THE MOST DANGEROUS 
POSITION TIGER WOODS OPTS FOR THIS SAFE ONE 
ANDERS ROMERO HAS PLAYED A CRACKING 
SHOT FIFTEEN FEET AWAY REMEMBER THIS ONE THE CLUB BROKE BUT NO BONES 
THAT WAS BAD THAT THAT 
HE HAS HAD A BEAUTIFUL THREE AT THE 
TENTH HE IS LOOKING TO DO THE BEST HE CAN 
TODAY AND THERE IS HIS FAITHFUL 
CADDIE NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS LEE WESTWOOD 
BUT NOT BAD AT ALL 
YES NO 
BACKSPIN TOO BUT MAKES A BIG 
DIFFERENCE NEVER AT IT THE FINAL GROUP UP THERE ON THE LEFT 
LOOKING AT THE FLAG POSITIONS LEFT THEY HAVE PUT THEM INTO THE CORNERS 
I DID NOT THINK I HAVE SEEN EIGHTEEN 
FLAGS SO CLOSE TO THE EDGES FOR A 
LONG TIME 
THAT HAS BECOME THE NORM 
THESE DAYS ON DETOUR THE FLAGS 
CLOSER TO THE EDGE ON AT THE 
DETOUR THAT LOOKS LIKE A THREE 
IRON ANYTHING ON THE SURFACE HERE IS A GOOD SHOT A REALLY TOUGH PAR THREE SOME CHEERS GOING ON AUGUSTO HAS COME TO LIFE AUGUSTA THIS FIFTH IS A REALLY GOOD PAR 
FOUR FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE YARDS WILL IT HOLD JUST 
TRICKLES INTO THE FLIMSY ROUGH THE FLAG HIS WAY BACK HIS WAY BACK IS WAY BACK GOOD ONE IAN POULTER ON THE FIFTH A 
DIFFICULT PUTT FROM DOWN ON THE 
BOTTOM LEVEL QUITE GOOD STILL 
ABOUT FIVE FEET NOT BAD FROM WHERE 
HE WAS THIS LOOKS MORE FAMILIAR THE FLAG IS THIRTY FIVE YARDS UP THE GREEN IT JUST GRAB TOO SOON JUSTIN ROSE FOR A PAR TO FINISH AT THREE OVER GOOD FOUR TWO THREE FOUR FINISH VERY 
GOOD APART FROM FOUR HOLES HE HAS 
PLAYED WELL BUT THOSE FOUR HOLES 
HAVE BEEN VERY COSTLY TIGER WOODS AND ELEVEN A BIG SWING RIGHT TO LEFT HE HAS OVERDONE IT BY A DISTANCE BRANDT SNEDEKER LANDED ON THE TOP 
HERE EXCELLENT HAY HAS LANDED IT 
RIGHT ON TOP OF B. T. R. IT KILLED THE 
FORWARD MOMENTUM STEADY THAT IS NOT VERY TASTY TWO HUNDRED FORTY YARDS THIS HOLE IAN POULTER FOR PAR WELL DONE HE IS PUTTING WELL THIS WEEK ABOUT TIME HE STEPPED UP TO BE 
PLAYED A GOOD MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIP 
THE PLATE WELL DONE HE STARTS HOME THREE FOUR A VERY INTERESTING SETTING AROUND THE TWELFTH TEE WHEN THE SPECTATORS 
ON UP HERE IT IS A HUGE EXPANSE OF 
BEAUTIFULLY MOWN GRASS YOU DO NOT 
ACROSS ANY TREES OR SHRUBS OR 
OUTCROPS OF ROCK OR ANYTHING GOING 
UP TO THE TEE IT IS JUST A SIMPLE 
WALK UP TO THE HIGH GROUND HE MUST HAVE HIT IT INTO THE RAE'S CREEK

CASEY HE IS ONE SHOT BEHIND THE 
LEADER IT JUST DID NOT MAKE IT IT FED BACK DOWN AT THE BOTTOM PAUL CASEY HAD THREE BIRDIES IN THE OPENING SEVEN HOLES LEE WESTWOOD AND TIGER WOODS ARE STARTING TO MAKE A MOVE THAT IS A BEAUTY EXCELLENT SHOT 
FROM SNEDEKER HE WAS ROOKIE OF THE 
YEAR LAST YEAR HE WON HIS FIRST 
EVENT IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS PUTTED IT NOT 
AS FORTUNATE AS ON THE FIRST HOLE 
OF THE TOURNAMENT IT IS SO VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE BIRDIES ON THESE FRONT LINES THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT 
PUTT ON FIVE HE IS AIMING SO FAR RIGHT THAT IS INCREDIBLE ANOTHER TOUGH PUTT FOR PAR HE IS FEELING THE 
CRUNCH AT THE MOMENT 
IT IS AMAZING 
HOW IT CAN COMPOUNDED SELF HE 
MISSED THAT SHOT ON TWO PULLED THE 
WEDGE ON THREE THE POOR TEE SHOT 
ON FULL FOUR FOUR TWO A LITTLE BIT AGGRESSIVE HE REALLY CANNOT AFFORD TO MISS HIS OPPORTUNITIES 
SNEDEKER SHOULD TAP OPPORTUNITIES THAT IN FOR PAR WELL DONE FLESCH REMAINS AT SEVEN 
UNDER PAR ONE BEHIND SNEDEKER TWO 
UNDER FOR HIS ROUND TODAY THIS IS A TOUGH SHOT IT IS NOT TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM THE PIN IS AT THE BACK GREAT PUTT WELL DONE IT IS AN AMAZING GOLF COURSE WHEN 
IT STARTS TO SLIDE IT JUST CAN 
CONTINUE HE DOES NOT SEEM FACE THAT WELL PHASED AT ALL BACK TO THIRTEEN TOUGH STANCE HUGE TEE SHOT THOUGH THE NOT TOO BAD HALF A CLUB SHORT 
BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT OVER THE 
DUNES THE A COUPLE UNDER TODAY AND 
HE IS MOVING UP A COUPLE HE IS PUTTING WELL ISN'T SHE THIS WEEK ISN'T HE DANGEROUS PIN EXCELLENT DEFINITELY A FRIENDLY 
BOUNCE THAT IS THE SIDE TO HIT IT 
ON ANYTHING LEFT IS ALL THE WAY 
DOWN TO THE FRONT OF THE GREEN VERY GOOD BALL STRIKING THAT IS NOT BAD A GREAT CHANCE OR 
ANOTHER BIRDIE FOR PAUL CASEY 
THREE UNDER ALREADY TODAY THAT WAS VERY LUCKY SIX INCHES 
LEFT OF THAT HE WAS FORTY FOOT 
FURTHER AWAY GOOD BOY IT IS A GREAT COMEBACK 
AFTER MAKING A TRIPLE BOGEY AT SEVENTEEN 
LAST NIGHT A WONDERFUL ROUND OF SIXTY EIGHT 
FROM ZACH JOHNSON THE DEFENDING 
CHAMPION VERY GOOD STUFF HE STILL 
HAS A CHANCE TIGERISH THREE UNDER FIVE SHOTS BEHIND TIGER IS THREE UNDER HE HAS HAD 
THE BALL A LONG WAY FROM THE HOLE QUITE A BIT THIS WEEK 
YESTERDAY TEN OR ELEVEN TODAY ON ELEVEN 
HE 
HAS NOT HIT IT CLOSE YET BUT THREE UNDER PAR FOR WHERE HE HAS BEEN ON THE GREENS I THINK IS 
QUITE GOOD 
OBVIOUSLY DEPENDING ON 
THE LEADERS BUT IF HE GETS A COUPLE 
MORE BIRDIES HE WILL BE RIGHT 
THERE NOT FAR AWAY JUST A FRACTION FIRM THIS PUTT WOULD BE EASY TO HOLE MAKE THIS TO TAKE THE LEAD HE CAN BE VERY AGGRESSIVE NEVER GAVE IT ENOUGH HE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL STOP A BEAUTY HE LEFT IT SHORT HE IS VERY QUICK ISN'T HE LEADING THE MASTERS SECOND HERE ON 
TOUR WHAT A THRILL FOR SNEDEKER 
SECOND YEAR STRAIGHT IN KEN BROWN IS BACK IN 
THE BOX 
JUST TIPTOEING HIS 
TIGER WOODS IF HE CAN BUILD UP A 
PAR FIVE HE WILL BE RIGHT IN THE 
MIX GOOD EFFORT HE JUST STARTED IT OUTSIDE THE HOLE A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HIM IT IS JUST THE PAR HE REMAINS SEVEN UNDER ONE BEHIND SNEDEKER LEADS BY ONE JUST A BIT OF MOISTURE ON THE 
GREENS NOT AS QUICK NOT QUITE AS 
QUICK AS THEY HAVE BEEN THIS IS TO GET INTO THE RED CABIN BIRDIE FOR HARRINGTON HE 
GOES BACK TO LEVEL PAR TAP IN 
BIRDIE ZACH JOHNSON HAS HAD THE BEST SCORE OF THE DAY JUSTIN ROSE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY 
SHOT ON SIXTEEN BUNKER SHOT DOWN THE 
ALLIANCE PITCH IT IN HIT THE FLAG AND IN 
SHE WENT FOR A TWO IF THEY HAD 
MISSED IT SHE WOULD HAVE GONE ALL 
THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE 
GREEN AND POSSIBLY INTO THE WATER 
SEVENTY THREE TODAY I THINK THE HIGHLIGHT 
MUST HAVE BEEN THE HOLE BUNKER SHOT 
AT THE SIXTEENTH PUNCHING THE AIR AFTER 
THAT ONE 
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
ACTUALLY PUNCHING THE AIR RATHER 
THAN CELEBRATING IT HAS BEEN A 
FRUSTRATING COUPLE OF DAYS THAT 
WAS DEAD YOU WOULD HAVE MORE 
CHANCE OF HITTING IT IN THE WATER 
THAN MAKING IT UP AND DOWN AS A 
WHOLE IT WAS A NICE BREAK THEY 
ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN L. HAVE 
KNOCKED IT ON THE PAR FIVES HAD A 
THREE PUTT SHOOT MYSELF IN THE 
FOOT 
HOW DID YOU COME TO TERMS FOOT WITH IT OVER YOUR DINNER LAST 
NIGHT 
IT DOES HAPPEN TO ME BEFORE NIGHT IT 
IS JUST THE WAY THE 
GAME IS IT IS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I FELT THE GAME WAS THERE TECHNICALLY 
EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER AND I HIT 
SOME GOOD IRON SHOTS BUT DID NOT 
GET THE SCORE TO COME OUT AND HAVE 
THE GAME AND NOT BE ABLE TO TURN IT 
INTO A GOOD SCORE WAS THE HARD PART 
SO HOW HARD IS IT TO BE ABLE TO 
TAKE THE NECESSARY RISKS ON THIS 
GOLF COURSE WELL STALL THE TIME 
KNOWING THAT ONE TINY MISTAKE CAN 
BLOW YOUR CHANCES WHILST ALL THE 
TIME KNOWING 
THIS GOLF COURSE 
REALLY TEASES YOU WHEN YOU PLAY 
WELL YOU THINK WHAT IS THE FUSS 
ABOUT IT IS RELATIVELY EASY BUT 
IF YOU GET GOING AT THE WRONG TIME 
YOU LOSE YOUR PATIENCE IT IS 
AMAZING HOW IT BITES YOU THAT IS 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE GOLF 
COURSE AND WHITE HAS CREATED SO 
MUCH DRAMA OVER THE YEARS WHY IT THAT IS A GREAT SAVE HE HAS GOT A 
COUPLE OF BEAUTIES HE HOLED ONE ON 
SIX FOR PAR YARD AND I HAVE TO THE RIGHT AND HE 
IS UP AGAINST THE PIN YARD AND A 
HALF THIS BOY HITS IT A LONG WAY AND WHAT A SHOT OF THIS GUY COMMITTED THREE HUNDRED FIFTY YARD ON FLY YOU WERE BEGGING IT TO RUN A LITTLE FURTHER HE HAS MISSED IT BUT IF YOU'RE 
GOING TO MISS IT THAT IS THE BEST 
TO MISS 
THE BUSINESS THAT SHOULD 
HAVE GONE RIGHT DOWN TO 
THE HOLE THAT IS A TREACHEROUS PUTT A YARD FURTHER A LITTLE BIT OF BREEZE OCCASIONALLY PICKS UP NO A COMEDY OF HE COMMITTED THREE HUNDRED FIFTY YARDS BUT HE DID NOT MANAGE TO GET THAT ONE HUNDRED TWELVE FEET JUST A LITTLE TRICKLE DOWN BER NOT MILES AWAY BUT NOT IT MUST BE PINPOINT ACCURATE YOU HAVE TO HIT IT BETWEEN THE EDGE OF THE GREEN AND THE PIN OR A DRIFTS OFF DOWN THE RIGHT HAND SIDE A LITTLE EARLIER TODAY I WAS DOWN 
AT THE FOURTEENTH THE CROWDS ARE 
STARTING TO GATHER THE BEAUTIFUL 
VIEW ACROSS THE THIRTEENTH WITH FOUR BIG 
WIDE BUNKERS AND I AM ON THE FOURTEENTH 
FAIRWAY THE DOGLEG HOLE FROM 
RIGHT TO LEFT VERY AWKWARD TEE 
SHOT THERE IS NO BUNKER BUT IT IS 
NOT EASY THE FAIRWAY WANTS TO 
KICKING IN THE RIGHT HAND ROUGH 
BIG SLOPE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT WHEN 
YOU ARE PLAYING A SECOND SHOT AND 
YOU WANT TO HIT A BIG HIGH FADE IF 
YOU CAN IT IS AWKWARD FROM THIS 
SITUATION YOU AUTOMATICALLY SWING 
A BIT MORE UPRIGHT AND THE TENDENCY 
OF THE BALL IS TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT 
YOU HAVE TO GUARD AGAINST THAT YOU 
HAVE TO BE PINPOINT ACCURATE AND 
FEED THE BALL IN FROM SLIGHTLY TO 
THE LEFT OF THE PIN MAKE THE CLUB 
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE BEND THE KNEES 
A BIT MORE AND REMEMBER IT WILL CUT I HAVE JUST SLIGHTLY OVERDONE IT 
BUT HERE IS HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO 
DO IT WITH TIGER WOODS OH MY GOODNESS TIGER WOODS HAVE 
WE ARE SORRY TO CONFUSE YOU THAT 
WAS A FEW YEARS AGO THAT WAS NOT 
TODAY BUT THAT IS WHAT KEN WAS 
TALKING ABOUT WE ARE MOVING INTO AMEN CORNER SNEDEKER IS IN THE BUNKER THERE IS 
A CHANCE FOR IMMELMAN FOR BIRDIE 
ONE BEHIND AS SOON AS HE STRUTTED IT DIVED 
RIGHT STRIKE IT ALL PAR SO FAR 
BUT HE HAS HAD A GOOD WEEK ON THE 
GREENS SO FAR A HOT WEEK FIVE 
UNDER YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO SQUEEZE 
SOMETHING OUT OF THE PAR FIVES BACK DOWN THE NINTH FAIRWAY PERFECT 
TEE SHOT FROM PAUL CASEY 
WHAT IS 
HE FACING 
HE IS ON A DOWN SLOPE 
SLIGHTLY LEFT TO RIGHT LOOKS LIKE 
AN EIGHT OR NINE IRON BEAUTIFUL SHOT FROM PAUL CASEY HE 
HAS BEEN EXEMPLARY TODAY THREE 
UNDER ALREADY ON THE ROUND HERE IS 
THE D. DAY IS THE LEADER THE MAY NOT HAVE HAD A PERFECT LIFE WE ARE WATCHING THE SEVENTY SECONDS MASTERS SPONSORED BY RELAX SEVENTY SECOND SHAME ALL THAT GOOD WORK HE HAS 
GONE ONE UNDER FOR THE DAY AND THAT 
WILL HAVE HEARD HAVE HURT VERY EASY TO LEAVE IT A FOOT SHORT TREVOR IMMELMAN TO TIE THE LEAD HIS HEAD CAME UP AS SOON AS HE HIT 
IT HE JUST PULLED IT HE REMAINS 
ONE OVER FOR THE DAY SOMETIMES YOU HAVE GOT TO HANG 
TOUGH MAKE FEW PARS DON'T LET THE SH SOLDERS GROUP SHOULDERS ANOTHER CHANCE TO SEE PHIL MICKELSON'S EXQUISITE SHORT GAME HOW UNLUCKY IS THAT THAT IS 
RIDICULOUS SO UNLUCKY IF IT 
MISSES THE PIN IT SCREWS BACK BUT 
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IT PICTURES A FOOT SHORT OF THE 
HOLE THE PERFECT GOLF SHOT 
UNLUCKY YOU HAVE TO GET ON WITH IT 
NOTHING YOU CAN DO OF ALL THE LEADING PLAYERS IT IS 
PROBABLY PAUL CASEY AND FILL MY 
COUNCIL WHO HAVE LOOKED THE 
SOUNDEST FROM TEE TO GREEN PHIL 
MICKELSON GOOD BOY OUT IN THIRTY TWO PAUL CASEY 
LEADS THE THE MASTERS A WONDERFUL FRONT LINE FOUR BIRDIES IAN WOOSNAM FOR A BIRDIE AT THE 
LAST THE ROUND OF SEVENTY SIX IAN WOOSNAM 
SIX OVER PAR A TOUGH SPOT FOR PADRAIG HARRINGTON HERE IT IS SO HARD TO GET IT UP TO THE 
HOLE HERE HE WILL BE QUITE HAPPY 
WITH THE THREE HERE HE IS HAVING 
TO GO BACK TO LEVEL ONE UNDER 
TODAY THAT LOOKS PRETTY USEFUL COMING 
OUT OF THE TREES AT THE ELEVENTH THIS 
COULD BE NICE A LITTLE UNLUCKY 
FROM WHERE HE WAS HE HAS GOT A 
RELATIVELY EASY CHIP RIGHT UP THE 
FULL LENGTH OF THE GREEN PAUL 
CASEY OUT IN THIRTY TWO EQUALS THE BEST 
FRONT LINE OF THE WEEK SO FAR PIPE 
WITH BRANDT SNEDEKER WHO IS 
HANGING ON WELL HE IS BEHIND THE TREES IT LOOKS 
FINE HE IS ON THE FAIRWAY BUT 
BETWEEN HIM AND THE FAIRWAY THERE 
WILL BE SOME TREES IN THE WAY L. 
THINK HE WILL STILL GO FOR THE 
GREEN A BIG HOOK ON THE FOUR IRON WHEN IT WAS RAINING EARLIER THE 
WATER WAS FLOODING OFF THAT LITTLE 
SECTION IT WAS RIGHT IN A LITTLE 
VALLEY OH DEAR 
THAT IS A TOUGH ONE BACK 
A LITTLE CHIP AND RUN FOR LEE WESTWOOD HE IS IN A GOOD POSITION THAT DID NOT DESERVE TO BE A SIX THAT IS VERY SAD THAT IS A SHAME A BEAUTIFUL THIRD SHOT AND IT HITS 
THE OPEN THE PIN IT IS IN THAT 
IS AS SIX FOR PHIL MICKELSON IT IS AN AGGRESSIVE PUTT HE HITS 
IT PRETTY FIRM HE JUST PULLS IT A 
FRACTION THAT IS A BIT OF A 
SETBACK FOR PHIL MICKELSON HE IS 
FOUR BEHIND NOW HE LOOKED SO GOOD 
AT 
THE START STEVE FLESCH POPS IT IN OH DEAR DEAR DEAR THAT IS MAYBE THE WORST SHOT HE HAS HIT IN HIS 
LIFE IT WAS AN AWKWARD STANCE 
RIGHT ON THE DOWNSLOPE THAT WAS 
PRETTY AVERAGE TO SAY THE LEAST 
THAT WAS A FEW MOMENTS AGO A 
TRICKY LITTLE PITCH TO CONTROL THE 
SPIN HE HAS GOT TO BE PINPOINT IT MIGHT COME BACK A LITTLE UNLUCKY 
THE WIND IS BLOWING THE UNLUCKY FLAG JUST KEEPING IT UP THAT HILL 
HE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE DID NOT 
GET APPLAUSE L. DON'T THINK IT IS A SHANK I DON'T KNOW OH DEAR HE JUST GOT IN FRONT OF IT HE SLICED IT THEY SAKE THE SHANK IS THE NEAREST 
THING TO BE PERFECT SHOT L. HAVE 
NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY SAY 
HE LOOKS LIKE HE IS EYEING UP HIS 
QUARRY HE HAS GOT TO LOOK THIS TWENTY FIVE 
OR THIRTY YARDS HE HAS GOT TO START RIGHT OVER THE 
GRANDSTAND IT IS THE SIXTY YARD HOOK 
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS GETTING IT 
UP IN THE AIR AND KEEPING IT IN THE 
AIR IT IS EASY TO HER KIT ALONG 
THE GROUND BUT WHEN YOU HAVE GOT 
TO HIT IT IN THE AIR 
THE AREA HE 
IS LANDING IT ON HOW DEEP IS IT 
SIXTEEN PACES TO THE BACK OF THE GREEN 
BUT IT IS A BIT SOFTER 
IS THIS A 
MISTAKE THIS IS DANGEROUS IT WENT TO THE FLAT OF THE BUNKER 
AND DID NOT PLUG UP THE FACE BUT 
IF YOU MISS THE GREEN THAT GIVES 
YOU THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO GET 
DOWN ONE OF THE BEST ANYWAY HE 
IS PLAYING WITH ANDRES ROMERO RIGHT DOWN ON THE FLAT THE PERFECT TEE SHOT LOVELY RHYTHM A GOOD STRIKE THAT IS NOT BAD NOT BAD AT ALL THE 
TOUGHEST ON THE COURSE SO FAR THIS 
WEEK THE STORY OF HIS WEEK HE HAS 
PLAYED VERY SOUNDLY FROM TEE TO 
GREEN AND JUST ONE OR TWO 
OPPORTUNITIES HAVE SLIPPED BY ON 
THE GREENS THREE UNDER STILL IN TIE FOR EIGHTH POSITION WELL DONE HE NEVER GIVES UP THAT 
MAN HE WILL TRY AND ALL THE BITTER 
END A GREAT COMPETITOR UNTIL PAUL CASEY HAS BEEN LOSING 
CONFIDENCE ALL WEEK THIS IS HIS 
FOURTH APPEARANCE LOSING GOOD TRY FORTY FIVE MINUTES LATE IN STARTING AFTER 
HEAVY PERIOD OF RAIN WE WILL BE 
FINISHING LATER THAN ANTICIPATED 
IT IS A MATTER OF NOT HITTING THIS 
TOO HARD PRETTY WELL PLAYED UNDER THE CUT HE HAS GOT A GOOD STRIKE ON IT NO 
WAY SHORT A DIFFICULT ANGLE 
THE TREES THERE COMING OUT OF THE 
ROUGH HE DIDN'T QUITE GET ENOUGH 
OF IT HE IS GOING ALONG NICELY 
TWO UNDER PAR FOR THE DAY SEVEN 
UNDER FOR THE TOURNAMENT ONE SHOT 
BEHIND PAUL CASEY AND BRANDT 
SNEDEKER IT HAS JUST CLUNG RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE PRECIPICE WHAT A FANTASTIC SHOT FROM THE 
YOUNG MAN HE IS MATCHING TIGER 
WOODS BLOW FOR BLOW WOODS IS IN 
THE FLAT OF THE BUNKER BUT HE IS 
GOING STRAIGHT DOWN THE CURLING 
RINK HERE NICELY DONE FROM TIGER PAST THE PIN BACK UP THE SLOPE MAGNIFICENT AN EXCELLENT SHOT FROM 
TREVOR IMMELMAN GREAT CHANCE TO 
GET THE SHOT BACK ONE OVER TODAY 
JUST ONE BEHIND CAN HE READ THE PUTT THERE IS A 
SLOPE TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF HIM 
WHICH ALWAYS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO 
SEE THE LINE WHICH WILL INFLUENCE 
THE PUTT I LIKE THE WAY HE PLAYS HE IS VERY 
BRISK THE BALL IS ON ITS WAY 
STRAIGHTAWAY 
HE HAS DONE IT THAT IS THE PERFECT WAY TO PLAY THE OPENING EIGHT HOLES YOU CAN SEE THE RELIEF IN HIS FACE HE IS ENJOYING THIS NO WONDER TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF AGE FROM NASHVILLE WELL DONE TREVOR IMMELMAN JOINS CASEY ON EIGHT UNDER PAR ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL HE LET IT 
SKIP FORWARD NOT THE LONGEST OF 
HITTERS BUT HE HAS HAD A BIT OF A 
RESURGENCE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF 
YEARS THERE IS A SMALL GAP AT THE 
TOP OF THE LEADERBOARD THIS IS FOR BIRDIE ON FIFTEEN OVER THE YEARS THIS IS WHERE HE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEADLY THAT WAS A POOR ONE JUST A PAR YOU CAN SEE THAT HAS 
ANNOYED HIM WHAT A SEASON HE HAS 
HAD THOUGH THAT IS UNFORTUNATE FOR WESTWOOD I 
CAN TELL YOU THAT NICK DOUGHERTY 
HAS DROPPED ONE AS WELL HE IS BACK 
TO PLUS ONE AFTER FOURTEEN PAUL CASEY TRYING TO ROLL THIS ONE WITHIN A COUPLE FEET A LITTLE KERR THERE PAUL CASEY 
WENT TO SCHOOL IN ARIZONA WHERE HE 
BROKE A COUPLE OF RECORDS FIRM IT IS JUST NOT HAPPENING FOR PHIL MICKELSON 
HE IS OUT ON ONE OVER PAR HE TRAILS BY FIVE THESE ARE THE ONES THAT TEST YOUR NERVES WELL DONE WELL DONE PAUL CASEY HE SPENDS MOST HIS TIME IN 
SCOTTSDALE HE ALSO HAS A HOME IN 
WEYBRIDGE HE IS ONE SHOT AHEAD OF TIGER WOODS 
TODAY THIS IS NOT GOOD OH DEAR 
THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE ALTHOUGH WE DID 
SEE JUSTIN ROSE HOLE IT FROM THERE 
HE IS DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT ONE 
IT IS THE ONE PLACE YOU CANNOT HIT 
IT WHEN THE PIN IS ON THE RIGHT SO 
EASY TO MAKE DOUBLE BOGEY FROM 
THERE 
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE GOT SIX THERE OR SEVEN YARDS TO AIM AT MORE THAN 
THREE YARDS LEFT OF THE PIN YOU GO 
DOWN TO THE LOWER LEVEL WHERE 
PATRICK HARRINGTON WAS THIS CLOSE 
TO THE FLAG YOU PROBABLY HAVE AN 
AREA OF FOUR YARDS BY FOUR YARDS TO 
LAND THE BALL IN PADRAIG 
HARRINGTON NO IT HAS GONE A YARD TO THE 
RIGHT PERFECT YOU CANNOT REALLY 
PLAYER MUCH BETTER SHOT THAN THAT 
IT 
IS ONLY THERE ONCE WEEK THAT IS WHY YOU SEE TIGER'S REACTION HE THINKS IT IS PERFECT BUT NO WE MAKE NO APOLOGIES FOR SHOWING YOU THIS AGAIN OH MY GOODNESS IN YOUR LIFE HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT WHO SAYS GOLF IS NOT EXCITING WELL DONE WHAT A GREAT FINISH 
BIRDIE PAR BIRDIE BIRDIE TWO 
UNDER PAR TIED TWELFTH EXCELLENT 
GETTING LOWER EVERY DAY A LONG WAY BACK IAN POULTER IT IS ANOTHER ONE HE HAS DONE IT AGAIN THAT IS TWO SHANKS RUNNING THAT IS AWFUL 
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE HE HAS AWFUL GOT TO PITCH IT IN THE FRINGE AND 
TRICKLE IT DOWN TO WHERE TIGER IT 
IS OF COURSE YOU HAVE GOT THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN A LITTLE EASIER I SUPPOSE HE IS 
ON THE UPSLOPE SO HE MIGHT BE ABLE 
TO GET A TOUCH OF GRAB ON IT BUT 
TOUGH HE PULLED IT 
A BIT THAT IS PRETTY 
AVERAGE IT WAS ONLY NOT HIS BEST SHOT IT HAS GOT TO GET THE BREAKS ON 
OTHER WISE IT MIGHT GO INTO THE 
WATER O. K. HE KNEW AS SOON AS HE STRUCK THE 
TEE SHOT THAT HE WAS IN TROUBLE 
JUST A BIT GREEDY WITH THE SECOND THAT IS NOT BAD ANY SPIN ON THAT 
BALL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN THE 
FAIRWAY BUT IT IS O. K. THESE BOYS 
AT THE TOP THEY HAVE GOT A CHANCE 
TO RUN AWAY WITH THIS THE WAY THE BALL WAS LYING IT 
DIDN'T LOOK TOO INVITING THAT WAS 
DEFINITELY A LOOSE ONE IT IS WHEN 
THE BALL IS STRUCK WHERE THE SHAFT 
MEET THE CLUB FACE IT GOES OFF ON 
A FUNNY ANGLE AND ON THE NEXT HOLE 
A LONG IRON VERY RARELY DO YOU 
SHANK A LONG IRON AND ANOTHER ONE 
A LITTLE QUICK WITH THIS WIN A 
LITTLE ANXIOUS AND SUDDENLY 
OFFERING THE SOCKET WITH THE CUP OF 
THE BALL THE SWING THAT FOR A DOUBLE BOGEY WHICH IS NOT TOO INVITING WAYNE GRADY IS JOINING US IN THE BOX 
IT HAS BEEN AN EXCITING DAY SO BOX FAR THE GREENS AS WE HAVE ALREADY 
SAID SOFTENED BY EARLY RAIN 
PLAYERS WILL BE A LITTLE MORE 
AGGRESSIVE WITH THE PUTTER WE HAVE 
SEEN SOME GREAT PUTTS WE HAVE SEEN 
SOME MAGIC GOLF AND WE HAVE SEEN 
THIS MAN CREEP UP THE LEADERBOARD 
JUST LOOKING BACK TO THE RIGHT 
THAT IS THE FIFTEENTH GREEN JUST WAITING 
FOR WHOEVER IT IS ON THE GREEN TO 
PLAY OR MAKE SURE NO ONE IS GOING 
TO BE PUTTING GREAT EFFORT TIGER IS ONLY FOUR OR 
FIVE BACK WITHOUT DOING VERY MUCH 
AT ALL HE STARTED THE WEEK AS A 
PROHIBITIVE FAVOURITE WITH THE 
BOOKMAKERS 
ALL THE PEOPLE AHEAD OF BOOKMAKERS HIM WHO HAVE NOT WON A MAJOR YET 
WILL BE FEELING NERVY 
I LIKE THE 
LOOK OF THIS GUY HE HAS GOT HIS 
SPREE SHOT ROUTINE IT IS ALL 
MOVEMENT HE DOESN'T GET STUCK OVER 
THE BALL THREE PROBABLY GOT CAUGHT UP A LITTLE BIT 
OUT OF THE FIRST CUT THAT IS A 
DIFFICULT PUTT FOR CASEY HE HAS BEEN DRIVING LONG AND 
STRAIGHT THIS WEEK HE HAS DRIVEN 
THE BALL THE BEST IN THE FIELD BUT 
HE JUST NEEDS TO FIND LITTLE BIT 
OF INSPIRATION ON THE GREENS IF HE 
IS GOING TO TAKE THIS MASTERS THREE UNDER FOR THE DAY A BIT OF A HIT AND HOPE HE IS JUST UNRAVELLING A BIT AFTER THAT BOGEY ON EIGHT HE DUMPED IN THE WATER YESTERDAY A GOOD RESULT FOR A REALLY GOOD PLAYER I GET 
MATE I GET NERVOUS WATCHING HIM 
PLAY BUNKER SHOT BUNKER SHOTS IAN POULTER'S HEAD WILL BE SPINNING AFTER THOSE LAST TWO IRON SHOTS HE WAS FIVE UNDER 
AS HE PLAYED 
THE EIGHTH NOW HE IS BACK TO TWO UNDER HE ALWAYS SEES SOME DRAMA HERE YOU ALWAYS SEE HE HAS NOT TURNED IT OVER AS MUCH AS HE NEEDS TO THAT HAS HUNG UP ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IT IS NOT ALL 
THAT BAD BUT IT LEAVES A LONGER 
SHOT ON TO THE DIFFICULT TENTH HOLE 
WE HAVE SEEN ONE OR TWO BALLS WITH 
A BIT OF MUD ON THEM COMING FROM 
THAT SORT OF HEIGHT SOMETIMES THEY 
GET A BIT OF MUD ON THE BALL 
TREVOR IMMELMAN HAS BEEN DRIVING 
LIKE A DREAM LIKE LEWIS HAMILTON IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET INTO THE 
PERFECT SPOT YOU NEED A RIGHT TO 
LEFT DRAW WHAT COULD A ROUND THE 
CORNER OF THE DOGLEG WORK IT 
ROUND ONLY GOING WITH THREE WOOD AN EXCELLENT TEE SHOT HE IS ALL 
THE WAY DOWN ON THE FLAT THAT IS 
HUGE YOU HAVE HEARD GARY PLAYER SAY HOW 
MUCH HE THINKS TREVOR IMMELMAN'S 
SWING LOOKS LIKE BEN HOGAN BEN 
HOGAN WAS PROBABLY THE BEST STRIKER 
OF THE GOLF BALL EVER BOTH SMALL 
WHEN NEAT TIDY SMALL MEN THIS 
MOTION HERE IS VERY SIMILAR HOW 
THEY DRIVE FORWARD VERY EFFICIENT 
THE EXTENT THROUGH THE BALL THAT THAT IS ABOUT AS CLOSE TO BEN HOGAN AS 
MY SWING IS TO YOUR WAS NOTHING 
LIKE IT YOURS L. DO NOT KNOW HOW THEY COME UP WITH THOSE COMPARISONS I SAY ON THE LITTLE LEDGE WITH A FAIRWAY AS WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY TIMES A 
BEAUTIFUL PITCH FROM PHIL MICKELSON 
HE HAD A FEW GOOD BREAKS IN THE 
FIRST ROUND PLAYED REALLY SOLID 
YESTERDAY PRETTY WELL JUDGED BUT AN AWKWARD 
ONE DOWN HILL LEFT TO RIGHT 
NOBODY LIKES THOSE TOO MUCH TWO LEFT HANDERS PLAYING TOGETHER TODAY A FINE SHOT FROM STEVE FLESCH IN STREET THREE PUT IT'S A NASTY THREE PUT BACK IN THE BOX PETER ALLISS IT IS ME AM GETTING QUITE EXCITED I THINK IT IS ALL THIS PUTTING THE 
HE'S GETTING TWITCHY THAT IS 
GETTING BE TWITCHY EVERYTHING IS 
TIGHTENING UP A BIT AS WE HAD TO 
WHAT SUNDAY EVENING PHIL MICKELSON 
WAS GOING ALONG NICELY BUT A GOOD 
MOMENT HERE ALL THE WAY LEE WESTWOOD COULD DO WITH A PUTT TO GO IN OH DEAR PUTTING IS SO FRUSTRATING YOU NOT 
YOU'RE NOT FEELING CONFIDENT YOU 
DO NOT ACCELERATE THE PUTTER 
THROUGH 
LET'S SEE IF IAN POULTER THROUGH CAN GET THIS ONE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF 
THE CLUB FACE HE HAS HAD A COUPLE 
OF SHOCKERS 
HE HAS GOT A WOOD IN 
HIS HAND THAT IS A GOOD RESULT THERE ROBERT KARLSSON YES FOUR UNDER PAR FOR ROBERT KARLSSON A TERRIFIC BOOK PUTT A GREAT CHEERS RINGING OUT NOW THE 
EUROPEAN CONTINGENT ON MAKING AS 
GOOD A SHOWING AT THIS MOMENT AS 
THEY HAVE DONE FOR A YEAR OR TWO 
WATCH THIS LITTLE SHIMMY MAKING HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WATCH THIS THERE YOU GO HE DOES NOT HANG ABOUT A CLEAN 
SWIPE THROUGH THE BALL NICELY ON 
TO THE TARGET IF IT STICKS IT 
DOES HOW ABOUT THAT A MASSIVE TEE SHOT FROM TIGER WOODS HE LIKES IT AND MY GOODNESS HE 
HIT IT STONE DEAD YESTERDAY AND 
NEARLY IN THE CUP AGAIN TODAY HE IS TIPTOEING UP THE LEADER BOARD HE IS A LITTLE HAPPIER THAN 
YESTERDAY YESTERDAY HE HIT A 
PERFECT TEE SHOT TO HERE A 
BEAUTIFULLY BALANCED WEDGE TO THE 
SECOND AND AN IDEAL RESULT AND TODAY IT NEARLY WENT IN OF THOSE CHEERS THE REST OF THE 
FIELD WILL THIN WHO IS THAT THEY 
ARE SPECIAL LOUD CHEERS YES HE HAS GOT THE EIGHTEENTH HOLE TO PLAY 
YET WE HAVE SEEN LOTS OF DRAMA AS 
THERE DRAMAS BUT TIGER DOES NOT 
TOO MANY SILLY THINGS HE DOES 
NOT DO MANY SILLY THINGS EXCELLENT STRAIGHT OVER THE TOP OF THE FLAG THIS AWKWARD SHOT WITH THE BALL BELOW YOUR FEET SO UNLUCKY JUST SKIPPED FORWARD A FRACTION IT IS A BEAUTIFUL SPOT THAT IS THE WAY YOU DO AT THE MASTERS YOU DO AT THE MASTERS YOU DO IT AT THE MASTERS WILL HE UNLEASH ONE HE DID 
YESTERDAY AND DISTURB THE WILDLIFE 
ON THE RIGHT HE MAY HAVE DONE IT 
AGAIN IT CLIPPED A TREE THERE IT 
GOES DOWN IN THE FOREST 
SOMETHING'S KURD THE SOMETHING 
STIRRED 
IT IS A TIGER HE IS ON THE PINE NEEDLES A BIG MOMENT HERE THREE FOR PAUL CASEY HE STARTED THE BACK NINETY FOUR FIVE THREE THE BACK NINE FOUR FIVE THREE IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW WELL YOU 
PLAYED THIS BECAUSE I OCCASIONALLY 
YOU WOULD DRIFT OFF THE FAIRWAY AND 
FIND YOUR BALL IN THE PINE NEEDLES 
YOU GET A DECENT LIE MOSTLY BUT 
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE CAREFUL OF TWO 
THINGS IF YOU GO ROUND THE CLUB 
THE BALL CAN EASILY MOVE ALSO BE 
CAREFUL OF HOW YOU TAKE YOUR STANCE 
YOU TAKE A FULL SWING IT IS EASY 
TO USE YOUR FOOTING THE CAREFULLY 
DO NOT SLIP YOU CAN MOVE THESE 
AWAY AS LONG AS THE BALL WILL NOT 
MOVED BUT YOU CAN OCCASIONALLY 
COME TO REST AGAINST ONE OF THOSE 
WHICH IS HORRIBLE 
I DO NOT WANT THE BALL TO MOVE SO I WILL NOT ROUND THE CLUB L. WANT A 
PROPER FIRMER STANCE DO NOT BE 
AMBITIOUS NOT TOO BAD IDEALLY YOU WANT TO 
AVOID THE PINE NEEDLES BUT IF YOU 
DO PLAY WITH CAUTION 
YOU ARE WISE 
BEYOND YOUR YEARS VERY WELL JUDGED YOU LARGEST BACK IN TIME TO WATCH 
IAN POULTER YOU ARE JUST BACK IN 
TIME 
I AM SURE HE IS GLAD HE IS TIME HITTING A WOOD INTO THIS GREEN A 
GOOD SPEED ON IT 
HE IS STILL IN IT HE JUST HAS NOT HAD THE PUTTS GO IN HE HAS NOT HAD ANY GOOD FORTUNE ON THE GREENS THIS TO TIE FOR THE LEAD WILL IT REACH NO HE JUST CANNOT 
BELIEVE HE COULD LEAVE AT SHORT A 
GOOD SOLID FOUR LEVEL PAR TODAY 
NOTHING DISASTROUS PLENTY OF TIME 
PLAYING WELL ONE SHOT BEHIND IT IS DIFFICULT WHEN YOU HAVE GOT EVERYTHING IN YOUR MEMORY BANK THAT WAS VERY FORTUNATE JUST SEEMED TO MISHIT IT LITTLE BIT LEE WESTWOOD HOPEFULLY POLISHING THIS OFF HE IS HAVING A BAD RUN TIGER WOODS WAS IN HERE YESTERDAY 
BUT HE HAS GOT A GAP THERE THIS 
COULD BE A CLASSIC HE WILL TRY TO 
RUN IT THREW EVERYTHING 
THE BRANCH 
IS A DANGEROUS HYDE AT THE FAIRWAY 
IT WILL BE A MIRACLE IF IT COMES 
THROUGH HERE IT WHEN STOPPED IT 
WENT HIGH IT A BIT OF BONN DANCING FROM DOWN FOR GOOD MEASURE HE IS GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY HE 
MAKES A FEW BOB TO 
HE HAD US 
FIELD BASHFUL WE THOUGHT HE WAS 
GOING LOWER FROM MILES RIGHT HE THUMPED IT 
INTO THE AIR AND OVER THE TOP IT 
CAME IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE GONE 
INTO THE HOLE NO PENALTY AND HE 
KNOCKED IT IN A SIMPLE PAR FOUR HERE HE WAS TODAY WATCH THIS MOVE SAM CAN PROBABLY DO THAT WITH A KILT ON 
THAT WAS ZACH JOHNSON FINISHING OFF 
ON EIGHTEEN EARLIER TODAY WITH A SIXTY EIGHT A 
GOOD EFFORT FROM THE DEFENDING 
CHAMPION HE SPOKE TO HAZEL 
VERY WELL PLAYED THE BEST ROUND 
YOU EVER SHOT HERE CAN YOU COMPARE 
THE VERY FACT THAT YOU HAVE COME 
HERE AS THE MASTERS CHAMPION THE 
DEFENDING CHAMPION IS IT'S A REAL 
THIS YEAR IS IT'S REAL 
A YES 
THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN SO 
REAL IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT IS 
YOUR FIRST TIME ORDER OF FORTY FIFTH TIME 
WHETHER YOU WILL WIN OR MISS THE 
CUT IT IS NICE TO BE HERE COMPARE COMPARE THE PRESSURES WITH DEFENDING YOUR 
TITLE WITH CHALLENGING LAST YEAR I I AM NOT LOOKING TO DEFEND IT I AM 
JUST TRYING TO GO ABOUT MY BUSINESS 
I PUT LAST YEAR BEHIND ME AND I AM 
PLAYING IN THIS YEAR 
AN EXCELLENT 
ROUND TODAY WELL PLAYED A FAIRLY GOOD COSMOPOLITAN FIRST 
PAGE PLAYERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD 
JOCKEYING FOR POSITION NICK DOUGHERTY HAS HAD A FEW 
STUMBLES THE MIDDLE OF THE ROUND 
COST HIM A FEW SHOTS SEVENTY TWO IS THE HIGHEST ROUND OF THE DAY GOING A BIT LEFT THAT WAS A GOOD BREAK THAT WAS GOING INTO THE JUNGLE 
HE IS DRIVING THE BALL BEAUTIFULLY ANOTHER LOVELY DRIVE IT IS HIS FORTIETH MASTERS APPEARANCE IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE FOURTEENTH HE'S TELLING IT TO GET DOWN ALREADY NOT BAD I AM JUST HAPPY TO SEE IT GO SOMEWHERE STRAIGHT TIGER WOODS A SLOW PUT UP HERE GOOD CALL I USED TO PLAY THE GREENS WERE MUCH SLOWER THEM HE HAD TO FIND THE BALL BEFORE YOU COULD GO OUT AND COMPETE YOU CAN SEE THE MARKER JUST LEFT 
OF THE HOLE THAT IS A GREAT SECOND 
SHOT FOR HIM IS THIS FOR A PAR A ROUND OF SIXTY EIGHT 
HE WILL BE VERY CROSS IF THIS A NOT 
GOING THIS 
NOT GO IN HE IS USUALLY SO GOOD AT THIS SORT 
OF PUTT UNDER THESE SORT OF 
CONDITIONS A LITTLE BIT OF 
MOVEMENT ON THIS BUT IF HE HOLES 
THIS IT WILL PUT THE FRIGHTENERS 
ON A FEW OF THEM BECAUSE HE HAS 
COME FROM WAY DOWN THE FIELD HE WILL END THE DAY ON FIVE UNDER 
FOR THE THREE ROUNDS PLAYED AND 
WHO KNOWS HE MIGHT ONLY BE TWO OR 
THREE SHOTS BEHIND COME THE CLOSE 
OF PLAY BUT THIS HAS TO GO IN IN IT GOES IT IS ALMOST INEVITABLE THERE IS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT HIM ONE BIRDIE GOING OUT THREE COMING 
HOME A VERY WELL CONSTRUCTED ROUND 
OF GOLF HE IS STILL FAVOURITE WITH THE BOOKMAKERS TO WIN JUST A LITTLE SHY FOURTH THE LEFT FOUR FEET LEFT ABOUT WHERE LEE WESTWOOD WAS 
YESTERDAY MUCH MORE GREEN TO WORK 
WITH TODAY OH NO A DOUBLE BOGEY BACK ON SIXTEEN AND THEN THAT PUTT 
HE NEEDS SOMETHING GOOD TO HAPPEN HE HAS HAD A FEW EXTRA PUT ON THE GREEN STEADY JUST A BIT AGGRESSIVE HE HAS HAD A TOUGH TIME THE LAST FEW HOLES VERY LUCKY TWO GOOD BREAKS IN A 
ROW THE FIRST BLEMISH AS WE HAVE 
SEEN FROM HIM ALL DAY HE HAS 
PLAYED QUITE SOLIDLY BLEMISHES LOOKING UP FROM BEHIND THE THIRTEENTH GREEN PAUL CASEY QUITE A WAY BACK THAT WAS A BIT OF A PUSHY ONE AND IT HAS WORKED BEAUTIFULLY THE CADDIE'S CLUB IS CELEBRATING 
ITS CENTENARY THIS YEAR ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
OF GOLF AT WINDY HILL L. WONDER 
WHAT THEY CALL IT BAD WIDE THEY 
CALL IT THAT WHY NO TIME FOR HEROICS YET QUITE SHELTERED THERE WHERE HE IS 
YOU DO NOT FEEL THE WIND FLAGS 
BLOWING LEFT TO RIGHT THAT 
GENERALLY MEANS THE WIND IS OFF TO 
THE RIGHT HE DOES SWING IT BEAUTIFULLY THIS BOY THIS SHOULD CATCH THE GREEN THAT WILL BE A TOUGH ONE OVER 
CAUTIOUS BUT IT IS THE CORRECT 
SIDE TO MISS IT ON YES THEY ARE PEPPERING THE FLAG TODAY 
IT IS QUITE A FUN COURSE TO TODAY PLAY IF YOU HIT SHOTS ONTO THE 
GREENS AND THEY STAY THERE WELL DONE HE NEEDS TO SETTLE HIMSELF NOW A COUPLE OF PAR FIVES COMING UP AFTER THAT ENORMOUS THREE WOOD OVER 
THE BACK OF THE GREEN A DANGEROUS 
PITCH BACK TO THE FIFTEENTH GREEN FOR 
LEE WESTWOOD BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED I FANCIED THERE WILL BE A FEW 
CHANGES AT THE TOP BEFORE WE UP SHOP FOR THE NIGHT QUITE A NUMBER OF PLAYERS HAVE LET 
THIS AFTERNOON'S PLAYED SLIP 
THROUGH THEIR FINGERS PHIL 
MICKELSON PARTICULARLY LEE WESTWOOD IS STRUGGLING HE HAS 
HAD SOME GOOD SHOTS BUT MISSED A 
SERIES OF SMALL PUTS ZACH JOHNSON AND BOO WEEKLEY HAVE 
GONE UP THE LEADERBOARD 
CONSIDERABLY WITH THOSE GOOD ROUNDS A VERY GOOD EFFORT FROM JEEV MILKHA SINGH 
IT WAS A DAY WHERE YOU CAME SO 
CLOSE TO STOP YOU TALK ABOUT 
PATIENTS HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS 
AND IT REALLY SEEMED TO TEST YOUR 
PATIENCE TODAY 
IT REALLY DID 
TODAY WAS PROBABLY THE HIGHEST 
SCORE I COULD HAVE SHOT L. HIT THE 
BALL WELL ALL DAY L. DID NOT QUITE 
HAVE THE RIGHT SPEED OR RIGHT LINE 
YOU HAVE 
TO PAY THE PRICE YOU CAME TO THE SEVENTEENTH A BRILLIANT SECOND SHOT FIRST I CAN READ THAT ONE 
THAT WAS NOT TOO BAD IT WAS 
STRAIGHT IN FROM THERE 
EIGHTY EIGHT THE TEE 
SHOT INTO THE TREES AND THEN YOUR 
SECOND SHOT EIGHTEEN 
EITHER YOU ARE MAKING X. OR FOUR 
I TRY TO MAKE FOUR 
DID YOU DO WHAT 
YOU WANTED TO DO TO MAKE TO 
MAINTAIN CONTACT 
I HAVE PUT MYSELF 
RIGHT BACK INTO THE TOURNAMENT 
THIS IS AS HIGH HIS SCORE AS I 
COULD HAVE SHOT TODAY L. AM STILL 
RIGHT THERE 
GREAT PLAYING TODAY 
GOOD LUCK TOMORROW YES PAUL CASEY IS ONE SHOT BEHIND BRANDT SNEDEKER HE DOES NOT WASTE MUCH TIME IT IS 
RATHER REFRESHING 
IF THEY HAD A 
BUNCH OF HIM OUT ON DETOUR THEY 
WOULD NOT BE TOO GOOD FIELDS LIKE 
THEY ARE THE TOUR PRETTY WELL DONE VERY DIFFICULT TO JUDGE HE JUST MISSED THERE'S A GREAT START LEFT HANDERS 
HAVE WON THREE OF THE LAST FIVE 
MASTERS ON BALANCE I SUPPOSE 
HIS TEE SHOT CLATTERED INTO THE 
TREES THEN CLATTERED BACK INTO 
PLAY HIS SECOND SHOT STOPPED SHORT 
OF THE WATER ON BALANCE THIS 
MIGHT BE MORE OR LESS FAIR HE WILL 
NOT THINK SO OF COURSE 
TIGER IS 
PICKING UP SHOTS WITHOUT EVEN 
HITTING THEM 
THAT MIGHT CHANGE 
AGAIN BEFORE WE CLOSE UP SHOP FOR 
THE NIGHT LEE WESTWOOD AND IAN POULTER HAVE 
GOT TO HANG ON NOW WESTWOOD GOT 
HIS BIRDIE THEY JUST HAVE TO GET ANOTHER 
BIRDIE IF THEY CAN BEFORE THEY 
CLOSE FOR THE NIGHT GREAT PUTT FROM IMMELMAN VERY SOLID IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE 
DOESN'T IT 
IT ALL STARTED AT THE 
EIGHTH HOLE FOR HIM HE PITCHED IT IN 
FROM THE THIRD SHOT INTO THE GREEN 
HIT THE FLAG AND NOTHING HAS GONE 
RIGHT FOR MICKELSON SINCE THEN ONE OF 
THE MOST IMPORTANT SHOTS OF THE DAY THE TWELFTH HOLE DESCRIBED 
BY JACK NICKLAUS AS THE BEST PAR 
THREE IN CHAMPIONSHIP GOLF NOT A 
GREAT DEAL OF BREEZE OUT THERE TO 
DEAL WITH BUT ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM 
THINKING HIT IT JUST LEFT OF THE FLAG GOING 
NOWHERE TO THE RIGHT OF THE FLAG 
JUST A BEAUTIFUL GOLF HOLE I AM NOT QUITE SURE WHERE I WOULD 
PUT IT BUT I WOULD PUT IT AT THE 
GREATEST PAR THREE IN CHAMPIONSHIP 
GOLF 
TO PLAY IT PETER IS JUST GOLF FANTASTIC TODAY IT IS NOT THAT 
HARD BUT WHEN THE GREENS ARE A 
LITTLE FIRM AND THE WINDS ARE 
SWIRLING TO PICK THE RIGHT CLUB 
AND HITTING IT 
YOU TRY THE 
POSTAGE STAMP ON A WINDY DAY YOU YOU ONLY PLAY THAT ONCE EVERY TEN YEARS 
WE GET TO PLAY THIS ONCE A YEAR I USED TO PUCKER UP ON THIS EVERY TIME IT IS A FUN HOLE TO PLAY WE TEND IS THAT THEN WHICH END THEY RUB THEIR ON THAT GREEN SWARD 
LOOKING DOWN OVER THE STILL WATERS 
THEY ARE UP THERE HE HAS PLAYED 
SOME NICE STUFF TODAY HE GOES FOR 
THIS PATIENT ROUTINE EVERY TIME 
LOOKING AT THE GROUND SEEING 
LITTLE SPOT ALONG THE LINE THEN 
WALKS UP TO THE TARGET EXCELLENT SHOT FROM IMMELMAN BLUE 
AND GREEN SHOULD NEVER BE SEEN 
EXCEPT ON THE BACK OF AN IRISH 
QUEEN MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT CONNOTATIONS 
THESE DAYS 
AN OLD SAYING SIR 
TERRY WOGAN TOLD ME THAT HE HAS UMPTEEN LITTLE PRACTICE SWINGS DOZENS HE JUST DROPPED HIS FIRST SHOT OF THE DAY LEADING THE MASTERS THAT IS AWKWARD IT IS ON THE 
DOWNSLOPE RIGHT ON THE EDGE THAT 
WILL BE A VERY TRICKY CHIP FOR HIM 
JUST A LITTLE CINK IN THE ARMOUR BEAUTY THAT WAS A BIG DRIVE GOOD HIT FROM 
PAUL CASEY HAVE YOU SEEN HIS ARMS 
THEY ARE TREMENDOUS THIS IS THE FINAL PAIR MARCHING UP 
TO THE TWELFTH GREEN PLAY WAS DELAYED 
FOR THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR 
EARLIER ON ARE DUE TO A VERY HEAVY 
STORM GOING THROUGH HERE BUT SUCH 
AS THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM HERE IT 
DISAPPEARED VERY QUICKLY SUCH IS LOVELY TOUCH IT IS NOT THE DAY YOU WANTED HE PICKED THAT CLEAN WHAT A SHAME HE WAS FOUR UNDER PAR 
COMING TO THE HOLE HE WILL HAVE 
THAT TO FINISH AT THREE UNDER ONLY A PAR WHAT A DEVASTATING WAY TO FINISH 
BACK TO TWO UNDER ADD FOUR UNDER 
HE IS STILL WITHIN STRIKING 
DISTANCE THAT MIGHT JUST END ANY 
HOPES HE HAS THE BIG SWEDE SIX 
FOOT FIVE SHOULD BE PERFECT FOR 
ROUND HERE THAT IS A TERRIBLE MISJUDGMENT FOR 
HIM IF HE DOES NOT GOOD DEED CHIP 
RIGHT IT WILL GO FIFTY FEET PAST VERY NICE ALMOST PERFECT IF THESE GUYS KNOW TIGER HAS 
FINISHED AT FIVE THEY WILL BE 
DESPERATE TO MAKE SOME MORE BIRDIES 
WHEN YOU THINK OF HOW THINGS CAN 
CHANGE AROUND IT WOULD NOT NEED 
TOO MUCH TO HAPPEN FOR TIGER TO 
MAYBE BEEN NOT LEADING THE 
TOURNAMENT BUT HE COULD BE VERY 
CLOSE TO THE TOP WHEN PLAY FINISHES 
TODAY NICE UP AND DOWN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BAD BOGEY THAT HAS HAPPENED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE TODAY JIM FURYK FINISHED ONE OVER TODAY SEVENTY THREE THIS IS A BIG PUTT FOR SNEDEKER BOGEY BOGEY FOR SNEDEKER HE GOES 
BACK TO SEVEN UNDER PAR AND ONE 
BEHIND CASEY AND IMMELMAN JUST LOOK AT THE STRENGTH IN THOSE ARMS YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE THERE THAT 
IS JUST A KNOCK TO THE BOTTOM OF 
THE HILL AND PITCH UP AND HOPE 
FOREHEAD PUTT THAT IS A WONDERFUL SHOT EXCELLENT 
SHOT FROM FLESCH HE IS ONLY ONE 
BEHIND IT IS ALL HOTTING UP NICELY 
ENGLISHMEN AT THE TOP OF THE 
LEADERBOARD THREE WOOD FOR IMMELMAN THIS IS A 
VERY DAUNTING DRIVE YOU HAVE TO 
HIT IT PRETTY FASTER YOU CAN SEE 
THE GREEN PRETTY FAST SO YOU CAN 
SEE THE GREEN THAT LOOKS ANOTHER SPANKING DRIVE WELL YOU CAN JUST SEE THE GREEN WONDERFUL EFFORT THAT IS A 
GUARANTEED BIRDIE AND IT LOOKS LIKE 
A THREE WAY TIE AT THE TOP 
IMMELMAN FLESCH AND CASEY EIGHT 
UNDER PAR A SOUTH AFRICAN AN 
ENGLISHMAN AND AN AMERICAN IT WAS A GOOD HIT BUT YOU COULD SEE HOW QUICKLY IT STOPPED TIGER WOODS HAD TO DO ONE HUNDRED INTERVIEWS AFTER HIS GREAT ROUND 
HOW MUCH HOPE HAS 
THAT GIVE NEW OF GETTING THE FIFTH 
GREEN JACKET 
I HAVE PUT MYSELF 
INTO THE GAME 
IN TERMS OF SIXTY EIGHT YOUR 
BEST ROUND FOR THREE YEARS WHAT 
DID YOU DO PARTICULARLY WELL 
I HIT 
THE BALL GREAT ALL DAY L. HIT GOOD 
SHOT AFTER A GOOD SHOT THE IRONY 
POOR ONE WAS ON THE EIGHTEENTH TEE THE 
ONLY THAT WAS A BETTER STRIKE HE HAS 
HAD A COUPLE OF SCARY ONES AT THE 
NINTH AND TENTH A BEAUTIFUL PUTT IT HAS BEEN A 
FRUSTRATING DAY FOR HIM OR TWO SHOTS WERE OUT OF CHARACTER THAT IS OKAY HE IS JUST KNOCKING 
IT DOWN THE FAIRWAY THAT IS AN 
EXCELLENT SHOT HE GOT IT RIGHT 
DOWN THE LEFT CORNER GOOD 
DISTANCE FROM THE GREEN WELL 
PLAYED A POOR TEE SHOT BUT HE HAS 
PUT HIMSELF BACK IN PRIME POSITION A VERY DAUNTING SHOT OVER THE POND 
WITH THESE LITTLE SLIVER OF GREEN 
ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE THIS GIVES 
YOU THE BEST CHANCE OF SPINNING THE 
BALL GETTING IT CLOSE TO THAT FLAG 
EIGHTY FIVE YARDS SOME SPLENDID GRAPHICS 
HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED BY THE 
AMERICANS WATCH THIS ONE COMING UP 
NEXT IT IS VERY EASY TO SPIN THE 
BALL BACK INTO THE WATER AND THIS 
IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE BALLS 
LANDING DIFFERENT SPOTS YOU NEED 
SIXTEEN EYES BUT IT IS INTERESTING IF 
YOU CARRY A LITTLE TOO FAR IT 
BOUNDS OVER THE BACK OF THE GREEN STEVE FLESCH IS THE JOINT LEADER 
HE GOT BIT OF BOUNCE ON THAT ONE 
AND INTO THAT LITTLE BIT OF FLIMSY 
STUFF THERE ARE OVER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AZALEAS ON 
THIS HOLE THAT IS WHY THEY CALL IT 
THE AZALEA A MAGNIFICENT SPLASH OF 
COLOUR 
HE IS TAKING ON THE BIG ONE COLOUR HERE HE'S DEFINITELY GOING FOR IT 
HE IS A LONG WAY BACK IT IS JUST A LAY UP PETER WAS TALKING ABOUT THE AZALEAS 
ON THIS TREE AND KENNY HAS BEEN IN 
THERE THERE ARE SOME 
THERE 
SPLENDID THERE SPECIMEN TREES ONE OR TWO ARE VERY 
SPECIAL THEY PUT THESE LIGHTNING 
CONDUCTORS ON RIGHT UP TO THE TOP 
OF THIS TREE TO SAVE THOSE IN 
STRATEGIC POSITIONS THERE ARE A 
FEW OTHERS THAT ARE MORE RECENT 
INTRODUCTIONS THEY DO NOT HAVE THE 
CONDUCTOR BUT THIS TREE MUST HAVE 
BEEN HERE FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS YOU CAN 
SEE WHETHER WOULD PACKERS HAVE BEEN 
WHERE THE WOODPECKERS WHEN PETER 
FIRST PLAYED HERE THIS WAS 
PROBABLY A STRIPLING 
YOU LITTLE 
MONKEY MIND YOU YOU ARE RIGHT 
MOMENT A FIVE WOULDN'T BE TOO BAD WITH THE SAND WEDGE HE HAS PUT IT 
OVER THE BACK 
SOMEONE SAID HE HAS 
LEARNT TO CONTROL HIS ADRENALIN L. 
THOUGHT THAT WAS A MOST INTERESTING 
THING TO SAY HOW YOU CONTROL YOUR 
ADRENALIN I DO NOT KNOW PERHAPS 
THERE IS A PILL FOR IT NOW 
BUT IT 
WAS A PROFESSIONAL MISS IT IS A 
TRICKY UP AND DOWN A LITTLE LONG 
AND SHORT ON THE FIFTEENTH 
YOU ARE 
RIGHT IF HE DOES NO WORSE THAN 
POOL SHOTS FROM THERE IT WILL BE 
OKAY BUT IF HE TAKES THREE YOU GO 
TO THE NEXT TEE HOT UNDER THE 
COLLAR 
OVER THE SARAZEN BRIDGE COLLAR PUT THERE TO COMMEMORATE JEAN 
SARAZIN YES HE HAS TURNED INTO THE WATER 
THAT WAS REALLY UNNECESSARY IF YOU 
LOT GOING TO LAY UP LAY UP THERE 
IT IS SAD SIGHT 
WE HAVE SEEN A 
FEW IN THERE OVER THE YEARS THAT IS A GOOD ONE THE TAP IN FOR PAR HE STARTED THE DAY AT FIVE UNDER 
SO TWO UNDER 
PLAYING ALONG WITH 
STEVEN HAYNES TODAY HE IS ONE 
UNDER WE HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF HIM QUITE A TRICKY LITTLE BIT OF GREEN 
FOR LEE IT IS WEEK OF WHAT MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN 
IT IS NOT BAD ALTHOUGH 
HE HAS THAT HALF A DOZEN SHOTS 
DRIFT AWAY LET THAT IS UNLUCKY WHAT A KICK 
THAT GOT THAT WAS REALLY UNLUCKY 
NOT TOO BAD A CHIP FROM THERE IT 
SHOULD NOT BE TOO TRICKY HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO HIT IT WITH ONE BOUNCE INTO THE PIN NEARLY IT SOUNDED SLIGHTLY MISHIT 
DIFFICULT TO TELL 
STUART SINK 
PLAYING WITH PAUL CASEY TODAY 
THREE UNDER FOR THE TOURNAMENT OUR 
AMERICAN FRIENDS HAVE NOT SHOWN 
MUCH OF HIM HE IS TIED FOR SIXTH AT 
THE MOMENT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOOK AT HIM NOW THAT IS A FOUR HE IS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE LOOKING TO THE RIGHT OF THE THIRTEENTH 
TREVOR IMMELMAN HAS AN INTERESTING 
LAY UP THAT IS VERY GOOD I SAY THAT WAS 
INCH PERFECT VERY NEARLY 
TREMENDOUS SHOT HE SENDS IT IN LOW 
WITH LOTS OF CHECK THAT IS A DROPPED SHOT UNTIL THIS POINT IT WAS A TERRIFIC 
ROUND OF GOLF HE WAS HITTING ALL 
THE GREENS LOOKING IN FULL CONTROL A LITTLE FIRM IT IS NOT GREAT BUT 
IT IS PUTT FOR PAR TWO PLAYERS 
TIED AT THE TOP TREVOR IN NORMAN 
WITH A TAP IN TO GO NINE UNDER 
TREVOR IMMELMAN HE HAS LOTS OF PREPARATORY SWINGS 
AND SOMETIMES HE JUST GOES UP AND 
GIVES IT A WHACK VERY QUICKLY I THINK THESE GREENS ON A QUICK ARE NOT QUICK ONE WONDER WHAT TIGER IS THINKING WE DID SAYING IT WASN'T BEYOND THE 
REALMS OF POSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD 
BE LEADING THE TOURNAMENT WITHIN AN 
HOUR OR SO WE WILL BE STAYING ON TILL THE END 
OF PLAY A LITTLE LATER THAN 
ANTICIPATED DUE TO THE BREAK IN 
PLAY FOR RAIN A TIMELY BIRDIE FOR 
PHIL MICKELSON 
TWO OVER FOR TODAY 
THREE UNDER FOR THE TOURNAMENT 
FIVE BEHIND TREVOR IMMELMAN HAS DOUBLED HIS LEAD FROM THE START OF THE DAY TREVOR IMMELMAN LEADS 
AT NINE UNDER AT THE MOMENT TWO SHOTS AHEAD OF CASEY THAT IS NOT GOOD THREE IN A ROW DROPPED A BIRDIE FOR TREVOR A TWO SHOT LEAD IT IS AMAZING HOW IT CHANGES EVERY 
MINUTE IT SEEMS TO CHANGE PAUL 
CASEY WITH THE BOGEY ON FIFTEEN HERE HE 
IS ON SIXTEEN THAT IS A MAGNIFICENT SHOT THEY DON'T COME MUCH BETTER THAN THAT BACK TO THREE UNDER FOR RETIEF 
GOOSEN HE SEEMS TO HAVE FOUND BIT OF FORM IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO JUST A TOUCH TOO MUCH THE CADDIE SAID 
GOOD BALL THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME IT IS NOT A 
LONG ONE BUT IT IS ON THE FAIRWAY 
HE NEEDS TO SETTLE DOWN WELL DONE HE STANDS ALONE IN 
SECOND SPOT FOUR UNDER TODAY SO 
FAR 
THAT WAS A GREAT TWO AFTER FIFTEEN FAR WHAT THE GREAT TEE SHOT VERY IMPRESSIVE IT CAME OUT LIKE A 
RIFLE SHOT LOOK AT THE RUN 
PERFECT I THINK OF ALL OF THE 
ASPECTS OF HIS GAME THIS WEEK SO 
FAR HIS DRIVING HAS BEEN MOST 
IMPRESSIVE IT IT HAS BEEN A 
SPLENDID EXHIBITION OF DRIVING THAT IS A PERFECT TEE SHOT FROM STEVE FLESCH TWO BEHIND YOU COULD SEE THE COLOUR OF THE 
GRASS THAT IS THE WAY IT HAS BEEN 
CUT 
ONE OF THE GREAT SIGHTS IS TO SEE 
THE MOWERS OUT THEY ALWAYS START 
AT THE GREEN END AND WORK THEIR WAY 
BACK TO THE TEE IT LOOKS DARK THAT 
WAY SHINY THIS WAY THIS IS A BIG 
INFLUENCE ON HOW FAR THE BALL GOES 
ONLY THREE PLAYERS AVERAGE OVER THREE HUNDRED 
YARDS NICK WATNEY IS THE LONGEST 
THERE IS ALMOST GRAIN ON THE 
GRASS LIKE PILE ON THE CARD WAY 
THE CARPET HERE AT AUGUSTA THEY 
HAVE GOT FEW LITTLE TRICKS AND 
THIS IS ONE OF THEM TO MAKE A 
COURSE PLAY THAT LITTLE BIT LONGER THAT IS JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR 
ORDERED SNEDEKER HAS DROPPED THREE 
SHOTS IN A ROW HE HAS GONE LEFT IT IS AN INSULT 
TO THE ROUGH TO CALL THAT ROUGH 
BUT HE IS JUST OFF THE FAIRWAY HE 
SHOULD BE IT IS A BEAUTY A BEAUTIFUL SHOT 
FROM THE LEADER TWO EXCELLENT IRON 
SHOTS INTO FOURTEEN FROM TREVOR IMMELMAN 
AND SNEDEKER NICELY JUDGED FROM IAN POULTER WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE A COUPLE OF 
CAMERAS AND FACILITIES DEVOTED TO 
THE B. B. C. IT CHECKS THERE ARE THESE LITTLE FACILITIES 
WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO SHOW YOU SOME 
OF THE SHOTS THE AMERICAN AUDIENCE 
DO NOT SEE WE HOPE YOU ENJOY 
SEEING SOME OF OUR PLAYERS PERHAPS 
MORE FAMILIAR TO US THAN THEY ARE 
TO THE UNITED STATES' AUDIENCE 
THAT IS 
THE PLAN ANYWAY IN A HORSE RACE YOU DO NOT LOOK AT THE ONES BACKED IN TWELFTH OR FOURTEENTH 
SPOT WHILE THE LEADERS ARE RUNNING 
AWAY 
THAT IS 
WHERE MINE NORMALLY AWAY IS YOU KNOW AS SOON AS YOU HAVE HIT IT WHERE IT IS GOING TO FINISH I I STILL THINK YOU ARE BETTER DOWN 
THERE THAN IN THE BUNKER OR TO THE 
RIGHT VERY NICELY DONE IT JUST GIVES YOU 
A BIT OF LANDING AREA IF YOU'RE 
COMING MORE CROSS THE GREEN NOT 
THE LONGEST OF HITTERS HE DECIDED 
TO LAY UP AFTER A GOOD TEE SHOT 
LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE SUN FROM 
THE TOP OF THE HILL IT CAN MAKE IT 
A DIFFICULT SECOND GOOD BOY TIED FOR THIRD SNEDEKER AN EXCELLENT PUTT HE IS STILL RIGHT THERE TWO BEHIND NOT TOO MUCH SPIN COME TO DADDY 
BEAUTIFUL DEGREES OF LOFT I THINK HE LIKED IT A WONDERFUL SHOT DEAD CENTRE TWO UNDER TODAY TEN 
UNDER TWO AHEAD OF PAUL CASEY 
THREE AHEAD OF STEVE FLESCH VERY 
TASTY THE TREES ARE IMPEDING HIM A LOT NO NO NO TOO MUCH THAT IS THREE 
TIMES PETER SAID HE HAS TO 
LEARN TO CONTROL HIS ADRENALIN HE 
IS VERY PUMPED UP 
VERY POPULAR 
ALL OVER THERE MIGHT DID STATES 
THE UNITED STATES HE IS TOO LOW THREE BEHIND HE IS 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTH IN WORLD A MASTERFUL DISPLAY OF DRIVING HE PULLED IT A FUNNY DAY HE HAS HAD ON THE GREENS TODAY WELL HOLED NOT HIS BEST DAY UP AND DOWN 
YOU HAD US GOING OUT 
THERE AT THREE UNDER FOR THE 
TOURNAMENT WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE 
TO BE IN THE THICK OF IT 
I DIDN'T 
REALLY NOTICE IT IS NOT MY CONCERN 
THIS WEEK L. AM TRYING TO ENJOY 
DOING WHAT I AM DOING AND BEING 
HERE IN THE AUGUSTA NATIONAL 
PLAYING IN MY FIRST MASTERS IT WAS 
A GOOD START A COUPLE OF GOOD 
BIRDIES EARLY ON BUT I DID NOT HIT 
THE BALL THE WAY I WANTED TO EVERY 
TIME I HIT A BAD SHOT I ENDED UP 
IN TROUBLE THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS 
AROUND HERE IF YOU HIT IT THAT WAY 
YOU EXPECT TO BE PUNISHED L. DIDN'T 
PUTT VERY WELL ALL IN ALL THAT 
ADDS UP TO ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR UNFORTUNATELY 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE TO 
ACHIEVE SEVENTY FOUR IS PRETTY GOOD AND FOR 
THE REST OF MY CAREER PLAYING IN 
THE MASTERS IF I SHOTS EVERY FOUR 
SEVENTY FOUR EVERY TIME I HAD A BAD DAY I 
WILL HAVE DONE WELL 
IT HAS BEEN AN 
EXCEPTIONAL START WHEN YOU SEE 
PAUL CASEY GOING SO WELL WERE YOU 
AWARE OF HIS MOVEMENTS 
TO BE 
HONEST I WAS NOT PAY MUCH 
ATTENTION YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO BE 
THINKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE NOT 
THAT YOU WOULD ANY WAY IF THAT IS 
WHAT YOU NORMALLY DO YOU CANNOT DO 
IT HERE BECAUSE THEY WILL CATCH YOU 
UP YOU NEED TO BE FULLY ON BOARD 
WITH WHAT IS GOING ON THE FACT 
THAT PAUL IS DOING WELL IS SUPERB 
HE IS A BIG HITTER WITH A NICE 
TOUCH ON THE GREENS IT IS A COURSE 
THAT WILL SUIT HIM AND I IMAGINE HE 
LIKES IT L. HOPE HE CAN FLY THE 
FLAG FOR ITS 
I HOPE YOU WILL GIVE 
US A RUN LIKE YOU DID ON THE BACK 
NINE YESTERDAY THERE IS A VERY GOOD 
CHANCE PHIL MICKELSON WILL BE 
PLAYING WITH TIGER WOODS TOMORROW IT WAS NEVER ONLINE IT IS A THREE SHOT LEAD FOR A MOMENT THAT IS A SHOCKER YOU JUST DON'T 
GO THERE THAT WILL TEST SHORT GAME WIZARD TREVOR IMMELMAN WILL BE THINKING 
DO I GO FOR THE GREEN OVER THE 
POND PLEASE FIND DRY LAND OR BE 
WIND MAY AT DO I LAY OUT HIS CLUBS SEEMED TO BE COMING ROUND 
IT WAS NEVER GOING ANYWHERE ELSE 
HIS CLUB A NICE GENTLE RHYTHMICAL ACTION 
FROM STEVE FLESCH A CLASSIC SHOT 
A LITTLE BIT OF DRAW SPIN HOLDING 
UP ON THE TOP LEVEL THIS COURSE HELPS LEFT HANDERS 
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO HIT LOT FROM RIGHT TO LEFT A MUCH LOWER TRAJECTORY LOOK AT THAT 
AND IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAT LEFT HANDED PHIL MICKELSON WILL BE JOINING US 
IN SCOTLAND LATER THIS YEAR 
PLAYING FOR US IN LOCH LOMOND 
JOINING US FOR THE B. B. C. 
BOB DIAMOND 
WILL BE INTERESTED IN WATCHING HIM 
HE IS A SUPPORTER OF PHIL 
MICKELSON'S I'M SURE HE WOULD BE 
FAR AWAY SUPPORTING HIS MAN TWO TWO BIG MOMENTS PARTICULARLY FOR OUR 
LEADER TREVOR IMMELMAN WOODS WAS A GOOD TWENTY YARDS FURTHER 
LEFT OF HIM AND HE HAS HAD GONE AT 
IT HAD AGO IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GO AT IT YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE A GO AT IT THIS IS WHERE JUSTIN ROSE CAME 
ADRIFT YESTERDAY HE PLAYED TO 
THERE HE HIT IT TOO HEAVY PUT IT 
IN THE WATER WENT TO THE GREEN AND 
TOOK EIGHT THE TOURNAMENT IS GETTING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM MICKELSON HE HAS GOT 
TO GIVE THAT SOME STICK TO GET UP THE HILL HE HAS NOT DONE 
IT HE HAS BEEN VERY LUCKY 
SOMETIMES THEY DO PLAY THAT QUICK HE IS A WALKING MONEY MACHINE THIS FELLOW YOU NEED GOOD NERVES FOR THIS SHOT YOU HAVE REALLY GOT TO ZIP IT VERY TIGHT FAIRWAYS AS WELL YOU HAVE GOT TO BE PRECISE A LITTLE SLIDER OF A PUTT NEW TERRITORY FOR TREVOR IMMELMAN 
PROTECTING THE LEAD IN A MAJOR 
CHAMPIONSHIP HE IS OKAY A VERY LITTLE PITCH HE HAS GOT HE 
CAN SAVE A SLIGHTLY THE RIGHT OF 
THE PINS BUT THIS IS ANOTHER 
TINGLE YOU WANT TO FIND DRY LAND THAT IS IN THE WATER IT IS TRYING TO STOP ALL THE WHICH 
DOCTORS IN THE WORLD HAVE BEEN 
WORKING ON IT AND THEY COME UP 
TRUMPS IT 
IS YOUR LUCKY DAY BUY LOTTERY TICKET IT HAS RELEASED NICELY JUST TWELVE OR FOURTEEN F. T. FOR THE BIRDIE LOOK AT HIS EYES PLAED CYMRU WOW IT REALLY MAKES YOU CROSS IT IS A FIVE THAT SAME MIXED BAG THE FOURTH SHOT FOR OUR LEADER THE BALL IS ALMOST OSCILLATING IT IS QUITE INCREDIBLE IT STOPPED THERE IT DID NOT NEED MUCH MORE TO TAKE IT IN THE WATER STRUGGLING YOU THINK ABOUT ONE IN 
TWENTY WOULD HAVE GOT SNAGGED UP MAYBE 
A BIT OF MOISTURE ON THE BANK THE 
VERY LUCKY IT REALLY SIT BACK DOWN THE GREEN 
KEN FREDDY COUPLES AT THE TWELFTH 
REMEMBER THAT HE WAS STUCK ON THE 
BANK GOT IT UP AND DOWN AND WENT 
ON TO WIN NOBODY HAS BEEN FIRED IT HERE YET HERE OF GREAT BIRDIE PUTS THE PRESSURE 
BACK ON IMMELMAN 
IMMELMAN'S THREE 
SHOT LEAD IS NOW TWO SNEDEKER WAS ROOKIE OF THE YEAR 
LAST YEAR WHEN THE WIND AND 
TOURNAMENT HE MADE MORE MONEY THAN ANYBODY 
COMING ON TO THE TOUR FROM THE 
NATIONWIDE TOUR HAS DONE IN THEIR 
FIRST YEAR SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY FIVE 
MILLION HE MADE LAST YEAR WELL DONE 
THAT IS A GREAT SAVE THAT IS ONE GREAT SAVE WHAT A HOLE THAT FIFTEENTH IS PRETTY GOOD LANDED SOFTLY DESPITE 
THE ROUGH AND THE DUSTY BREEZE 
THREE UNDER FOR THE ROUND SEVENTY EIGHT IS THE HIGHEST SCORE TODAY 
STILL A COUPLE OF HOLES TO GO ROUND 
THINGS CAN HAPPEN IT IS DOWN THE BOTTOM ONE OF THE BRADY BUNCH HE LOOKS 
VERY CHEERFUL HE DOES NOT LOOK 
LIKE HE IS UNDER PRESSURE BUT HE IS THIS PIN KIND OF SUITS HIM 
DANGEROUS THERE IS THERE IS 
ANOTHER LOOK DANGEROUS ONE ON THE 
RIGHT ANOTHER DANGEROUS ONE BOTTOM LEFT IT'S ALL RIGHT IT IS FUNNY HE HIT THAT TWENTY YARDS 
LEFT OF SNEDEKER AND HE IS NEARER 
THE HOLE A GREAT DAY FOR CASEY HIS AVERAGE IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE HIS DRIVE IS NOT THE LONGEST NEW AREA TO THE LEFT OF THE SIXTEENTH 
HAS BEEN CLEARED OF SOME OF THE 
TREES THAT IS A NICE SPOT DOWN THERE IN SHE GOES BEAUTIFUL PACE I LOVE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO 
THEM WE WILL HAVE ALL THAT 
TOMORROW THAT IS THREE IN A ROW WE HAVE SEEN FROM THAT AREA STEWART JINK WAS PLAYING ALONGSIDE PAUL CASEY TODAY STEWART CINK TREVOR IMMELMAN WILL BE KEEPING A GOOD EYE ON THIS PUTT THAT'S ALL RIGHT A LONG WAY AWAY UP THE HILL THE MIDDAY RAINS TO THE LOT OF 
STING OUT OF THE GREENS IN TERMS OF 
PACE TOOK A LOT THEY CAN BE 
MUCH QUICKER AT THE WEEKEND THAT 
GREEN TEAMS RATHER THAN THAT YELLOW 
LOOK THEY SOMETIMES HAVE GREEN 
TINGE IT IS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS IN 
GOLF YOU HAVE PLAYED ALL DAY ON 
LIGHTNING FAST GREENS AND THEN ALL 
OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE A SLOW ONE 
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD LOOK AT YOUR 
ROUND IN TWO WAYS YOU LET A FEW 
AWAY AND THERE WAS ANOTHER 
WONDERFUL SIXTY NINE BACKING UP YESTERDAY'S 
SIXTY NINE 
ANOTHER WONDERFUL SIXTY NINE AM SIXTY NINE HAPPY WITH THAT L. AM SURE I MADE A 
COUPLE OF MISTAKES BUT IF YOU 
MANAGE TO PLAY PERFECT ROUND OF 
GOLF AND GET THROUGH THIS COURSE 
WITHOUT A BOGEY THAT IS AN 
INCREDIBLE THING L. WILL NOT DWELL 
ON THAT I AM HAPPY WITH TODAY L. 
NEED 
TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT L. NEED TO GO EVEN LOWER THAN TREVOR TOMORROW 
THE GAME LOOKS PRETTY TOMORROW GOOD TOMORROW FULL SWING RHYTHM 
WHAT IS YOUR GAME PLAN 
BACK UP I 
WAS GOING TO ASK YOU THAT IT'S 
JUST MORE OF THE SAME IT'S ROUTINE 
NOT DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAT 
IS THE GAME PLAN FOR TOMORROW L. 
HAVE THEIR WAY OF PUTTING MYSELF 
AROUND THIS GOLF COURSE WHICH I 
REALLY LIKE THE WIND WILL BE AT I 
WILL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITIES WHEN I 
GET THEM L. HAD A LOT OF GOOD GOLF 
SHOTS WHEN THE WIND PICKS UP A TRY 
AND HIT SHOTS AND MOVE IT AROUND IN 
THE WIND IF I CAN DO IT LIKE YOU 
DID TODAY THERE IS NO REASON I 
CANNOT MAKE SOME BIRDIES 
CONGRATULATIONS MAYBE ANOTHER 
WONDERFUL ROUND WILL BE ALL YOU 
NEED 
I HOPE SO IF TREVOR NEED CONTINUES TO PLAY LIKE HE IS NOW IT 
WILL BE DIFFICULT BUT I WILL WORRY 
ABOUT MYSELF ONE SHOT AT A TIME THAT SHOULD BE O. K. HE HAS MISSED 
THE FAIRWAY I THINK WILL BE O. K. FOR A SHOT ON TO THE GREEN IAN POULTER THUMPED THE 
LAST THREE OVER HE HAS GOT TO GET 
DOWN IN TWO FROM THE GREEN SIDE 
BUNKER THAT FOR SEVENTY FIVE A NUMBER OF BRITISH PLAYERS GOING 
WELL LEE WESTWOOD IS ONE OF THEM 
HE HAD FEW PROBLEMS WITH THE 
PUTTER TODAY BUT STILL MANAGED TO 
SECURE FOUR BIRDIES FOR SEVENTY THREE A LITTLE EARLIER HE SPOKE TO HAZEL 
SUM UP YOUR DAY YOU GOT IT OUT TO 
FOUR UNDER LOOKED LIKE IT WAS 
GOING WELL 
I HAD TO MAKE MORE 
BIRDIES THE BIRDIES I MADE WERE 
TAP INS I THREE PUTTED THREE TIMES 
ONE OF THEM FROM FIFTEEN FEET L. AM NOT 
MAKING ANY LONG PUTTS 
IS THERE ANY 
WAY TO REMEDY THAT QUICKLY L. 
SUPPOSE THIS COURSE NOT BE 
CONFIDENT AND OF YOU KNOCKS THE 
CONFIDENCE AND DROP YOU 
I HAVE HAD 
ONE OR TWO ROUNDS DURING THE WEEK 
WHERE I HAVE ROLLED A COUPLE OF TWENTY 
FOOTERS IN BUT THAT HAS BEEN 
DECENT FOR ME YOU CANNOT WIN GOLF 
TOURNAMENTS NOT PUTTING WELL WHAT WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR TOMORROW WE YOU GO 
TO THE PUTTING GREEN NOW 
I HAVE 
BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT FOR FIFTEEN 
YEARS AND I STILL HAVE NOT GOT MY 
FINGER ON IT YOU JUST KEEP GOING 
TO BACK TO THE PUTTING GREEN AND 
TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS BUT THIS 
ONE HAS GONE I THINK L. L. A NINE 
BEHIND THAT IS TOO FAR BACK IT 
FEELS LIKE ONE HAS GOT AWAY 
BECAUSE I SHOULD BE STILL IN DOUBLE 
FIGURES IT IS A GAME WITHIN A GAME A GOOD FINISH FROM IAN POULTER BUT IT IS A ROUND OF SEVENTY FIVE TWO UNDER EIGHT BEHIND AT 
THE MOMENT HIS HIGHLIGHT WAS A HOLE IN ONE AT THE SIXTEENTH HE BELTED IT OUT TO THE RIGHT IT CAME OFF THE HILL NICELY HOMED IN LIKE THAT A BIG CHEER HE'S A BIG ARSENAL SUPPORTER STEVE FLESCH SECOND SHOT IT WAS 
NOT A GREAT LIE A GREAT SHOT THAT 
IS THE SHOT OF THE DAY FIRST STOP 
THAT WAS MAGNIFICENT HE IS ONLY 
THREE BEHIND IT HAS STAYED PUT THAT IS NOT A MILLION MILES AWAY STEVE FLESCH WILL HAVE A PUTT FOR A SIXTY NINE I SAID THIS WAS THE SHOT OF THE DAY 
BUT I HAVE JUST REMEMBERED TIGER 
WOODS'S THREE WOOD AT THE SECOND 
THAT WAS MAJESTIC HE HAS PLAYED 
BEAUTIFULLY TODAY IF YOU GET ONE SKIDDING IT CAN 
JUST RUN AWAY FROM YOU IT IS EASY 
TO SKID ONE OVER THE BACK OF THE 
GREEN HE IS VERY METICULOUS IT IS NOT BAD IT LOOKED FOR A 
MOMENT AS IF IT WOULD STOP STONE 
DEAD AND RUN BACKWARDS BUT HE IS 
O. K. I THINK THIS SHOT WAS AS GOOD AS IT GETS LOOK AT THAT THEIR MAGNIFICENT SHOT FROM TIGER WOODS TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN YARDS YOU HAVE GOT TO BE GOOD TO DO THAT BACK TO THE FINAL PAIR ON THE SEVENTEENTH THE PLAYERS PLAY THE PRACTICE 
ROUNDS THEY MARK WHERE THE SLOPES 
ARE HE HAS PLAYED A FEW PRACTICE 
ROUNDS WITH JUSTIN ROSE AND IAN 
POULTER A FEW WEEKS BEFORE PLAYING 
THE TOURNAMENT IT IS UPHILL RIGHT 
TO LEFT THE LAST FIVE FEET OR SO 
OF DOWN THE OTHER SIDE NOT QUITE BUT THAT WAS VERY NICELY 
DONE FIRST OF VERY GOOD POACHED THERE VERY GOOD TOUCH THERE FOUR AT 
THE LAST FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR AT THE LAST FOR SEVENTY HERE IT COMES IT WILL NOT GET TO THE HOLE IT WILL NOT BE TOO FAR 
AWAY THOUGH IT ALL WENT WRONG AT 
THE AGE EIGHT THE SMILE WAS STILL THERE FOUR AT THE LAST FOR SEVENTY ONE IT IS A GOOD PAR SEVENTY SIX FOR PHIL 
MICKELSON HE WILL BE BITTERLY 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT EIGHT SHOTS BEHIND STEVE FLESCH HAS A PUTT FOR SIXTY NINE IT 
WOULD TAKE HIM TO EIGHT UNDER 
SHOULD IT GOING GO IN AND IT DOES SEVENTY TWO SIXTY SEVEN SIXTY NINE WARM APPLAUSE FOR STEVE FLESCH ON THE EIGHTEENTH TEE BRANDT SNEDEKER 
HE NEEDS A BIRDIE IF HE WANTS TO BE 
IN THE LAST MATCH TOMORROW EIGHT UNDER 
PAR TIED WITH STEVE FLESCH TWO BEHIND TREVOR IMMELMAN IN NASHVILLE BOY NATIONAL BOY A NASHVILLE BOY THE SAME ROUTINE EVERY TIME MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE YARDS UPHILL AT THE EIGHTEENTH 
A VERY LONG PAR FOUR A FEW THINGS FOR YOU TOMORROW IT ALL STARTS WITH THE LONDON MARATHON 
BUT IF IT IS GOLF YOU WHAT AFTER 
OF COURSE THE MASTERS 
AS FOR THE LEADER BOARD TREVOR 
IMMELMAN HAS BEEN AT THE TOP FOUR 
QUITE A CONSIDERABLE TIME HE IS PLAYING BEAUTIFULLY 
IT WAS A DAY YOU PROPEL YOURSELF UP 
THE LEADER BOARD THE CO LEADER AT 
ONE STAGE WHAT WAS THE KEY TO 
THAT 
THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION I AM THAT NOT TOO SURE THE TEE SHOT ON ONE 
WAS NOT TOO GOOD L. DID NOT MAKE 
THE PUTT BUT IT FELT LIKE I HAD 
GOT AWAY WITH ONE WHEN I GOT THE 
OPPORTUNITY IS OPPORTUNITIES 
LATER ON THE PUTTS WENT IN AND 
THEY HAVE NOT REALLY SO FAR SO I 
AM FORTUNATE IT SHOWS HOW QUICKLY 
QUICKLY YOU CAN JUMP UP THE 
LEADERBOARD THIS IS A TOUGH GOLF 
COURSE 
CAN YOU WIN BE GREEN JACKET 
WITHOUT STATING THE OBVIOUS I AM 
THREE BEHIND TREVOR L. CANNOT WORRY 
ABOUT HIM OR ANYONE ELSE ARE THERE 
I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY OWN GAME 
I HAVE TO TRY TO MAKE BIRDIES 
CONTINUE TO PLAY THE GOOD GOLF I 
HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT IS AS SIMPLE 
AS THAT TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE 
ENTERTAINING THE WIND WILL PICK UP 
AND PEOPLE TALK ABOUT PATIENTS AND 
NOT TRYING TO FORCE IT AROUND A 
GOLF COURSE AND I THINK THAT WILL 
BE KEY PATIENCE L. THINK IT IS 
ABOUT HITTING THE GOLF BALL ON THE 
WIND KEEPING IT BELOW THE HOLE AND 
GIVING MYSELF OPPORTUNITIES WHICH 
IS WHAT I DID TODAY IF BOGEYS DO 
HAPPEN WHICH THEY DID TODAY THEN 
I KNOW I CAN BOUNCE BACK AND MAKE 
BIRDIES AND HOPEFULLY I WILL MAKE 
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE TOMORROW 
BUT WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS L. AM 
ONLY IN CONTROL OF MY OWN GAME NOT 
ANYONE ELSE'S AND SO SAY ALL OF US A BIT OF INDECISION THE CADDIE 
SAYS HE LIKES IT AND THAT IS ENOUGH 
FOR HIM YOU HAVE TO TRUST YOUR 
CADDIE I RECKON THEY HAVE SETTLED 
ON A SIX IRON A GOOD SHOT A GOOD CADDIE THEY 
ARE ALWAYS GOOD THE OLD CADDIES 
DIFFERENT CLASS TODAY ONLY IN APPEARANCE HE REALLY DOES GRIND BIT OUT IT TWO SHOTS AHEAD AND HE IS NOT 
HAPPY ABOUT SOMETHING MAYBE HE 
CANNOT GET TO THE BALL CLEANLY 
ENOUGH HELLO HELLO HELLO SWEET AS A NUT THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT DAY FOR 
TREVOR IMMELMAN L. THINK IT IS EVEN 
HARDER ON THE THIRD DAY TO MAINTAIN 
YOUR POSITION IF YOU'RE LEADING AN 
ODD MIXTURE OF GOOD AND BAD AND 
UNFORCED ERRORS AND MISTAKES BUT 
HE REALLY HIT THIS VERY CRISPLY HE 
SEEMED TO BE WORRIED IT WAS GOING 
TOO FAR IT JUST LANDED ON TOP OF 
THE RIDGE IT LOOKED FOR ONE MOMENT 
AS IF IT MIGHT HAVE GONE IN THE 
HOLE THIS WAS PRETTY GOOD AS WELL TWO GOOD ONES THERE THE WAY THEY WORKED THE DROP FIRST 
IN HIS LAST OUT FLESCH WAS IN THE 
CLUBHOUSE FIRST TIGER COULD BE TWO OR THREE BRUCE 
FROM THE END TOMORROW GROUPS 
TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY WHILE THEY GET READY TO PUTT LET'S HAVE QUICK WORD WITH IAN POULTER 
YOU STARTED WITH SUCH GREAT HOPE 
THIS MORNING BUT IT WAS NINE AND TEN 
WHICH UNDID YOU SAW STOCK IT IS 
SHAME REALLY 
I GOT TWO BAD LIES 
REALLY ONE DID YOU THE MOST 
SEVERE PART WAS THE DOWNSLOPE L. AM 
TRYING TO STUB ACROSS IT A NINE 
IRON IT WAS JUST A HORRIBLE SHOT 
REALLY IT DIDN'T COME OUT TOO WELL 
I MADE A BOGEY THERE AND I GOT A 
HUGE CLUMP OF MUD ON MY BALL ON THE 
TENTH AGAIN THE BALL IS OVER MY 
FEET THE WIND IS OFF THE RIGHT I 
AM TRYING TO CHOKE DOWN MY FOREARM 
AND CUT IT IT THE IT IS A RECIPE 
FOR DISASTER IT DIDN'T COME OFF 
VERY WELL I MADE DOUBLE AND AS SIXTEEN 
PAST BE SIXTEEN PAST YES WHAT A BOY SEVENTY FOUR SNEDEKER NINE 
UNDER PAR AND HE WILL BE IN THE 
LAST GROUP TOMORROW WHAT A GREAT 
DAY FOR HIM HE HAD THAT BAD SPELL 
THREE BOGEYS ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN AND THREE 
BIRDIES AFTER THAT 
A GREAT FINISH 
A GREAT ROUND 
JUST TREVOR IMMELMAN 
LEFT ON THE COURSE AND HE IS VERY 
CLOSE HE IS WHAT TWENTY INCHES AWAY 
AND HE IS CERTAINLY NOT TREATING IT 
WITH DISDAIN THERE IT IS TWO THREES TO FINISH FOR 
THOSE TWO BOYS AND A GOOD ROUND OF 
GOLF FROM BOTH OF THEM AN 
EXCELLENT BIT OF PLAY WILL STOP 
TIGER WOODS AT FIVE UNDER 
HE FINDS 
HIMSELF SIX BEHIND GOING INTO THE 
FINAL ROUND PLAY A TERRIFIC 
ROUND FROM TREVOR IMMELMAN SOME OF 
THE BEST DRIVING I HAVE SEEN FOR 
POWER AND ACCURACY 
INTO THE LITTLE CABIN WHERE THEY 
CHECK THE SCORE CARDS THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE TURNING 
POINT HIS PITCH UP TO THE FIFTEENTH L. 
THOUGHT THIS WAS DEFINITELY GOING 
INTO THE WATER IT ZIPPED SO 
QUICKLY SEEMED TO HESITATE AND IT 
CERTAINLY STARTED TO GO AGAIN AND 
AGAIN AND THEN IT STOPPED THAT WAS PROBABLY HIS BEST BREAK OF 
THE DAY EVEN THOUGH IT LOOK LIKE 
IT WAS ON THE MOVE 
THE BEST BREAK 
OF HIS LIFE 
IT WILL BE IF HE WINS 
TOMORROW HE WILL REMEMBER THAT 
SHOT FOREVER MORE A GOOD MIXED 
BAG OF PLAYERS ON THE LEADER BOARD 
TOMORROW WE ARE IN FOR A SPANKING 
DAY 
HAVE SEEN SOME 
WONDERFUL STUFF THOSE TWO YOUNG 
PLAYERS HANDLED THEMSELVES WELL 
CERTAINLY SNEDEKER STARTED OFF 
WELL HAD TROUBLE AND FINISHED 
WELL TREVOR HE HAS PLAYED 
SUPERBLY HE DROVE IT WELL HANDLED 
IT AT THE END A COUPLE OF BIRDIES 
HE WILL BE HARD TO TOSS THAT 
BIRDIE ON THE LAST IS VERY 
IMPORTANT ONE MORE SHOT AWAY FROM 
TIGER 
BOTH ARE LIVING UNDER TIGER PRESSURE A COUPLE OF DAYS OF BEING 
RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE LEADERBOARD 
IT MUST BE WEARING AFTER A WHILE 
THEY HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN TOMORROW 
IT IS THE HARDEST THING YOU CAN DO 
TO LEAD ALL THE WAY TREVOR HAS 
DONE IT ALL THE TIME IT IS GOING 
TO BE BIG NIGHT FOR THEM TONIGHT 
THEY WILL HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING 
HOW SHOULD THEY FACE TOMORROW DOES 
TRY TO PLAY MORE OF THE SAME BE 
RELAXED OR BE AGGRESSIVE 
THAT IS 
ALL THEY CAN DO THEY HAVE BEEN 
PLAYING WELL DOING WHAT THEY HAVE 
DOZENS IF THEY GO OUT AND DO THE 
SAME THING AS THEY HAVE THE LAST 
FEW DAYS I KNOW IT IS EASY TO SAY 
BUT THAT IS ALL YOU CAN DO YOU 
CANNOT GO AND REINVENT THE WHEEL 
WE HAVE SEEN SOME TERRIFIC STUFF 
MAGNIFICENT 
TREVOR IMMELMAN HAS MAGNIFICENT STRUCK THE BALL BEAUTIFULLY MAGNIFICENT ALL 
WEEK 
THIS IS AT THE THIRTEENTH THIS IS 
HIS THIRD IT COMES UP SOLO BUT 
WITH A LOT OF SPIN IT IS A 
BEAUTIFUL SHOT 
THAT IS CONTROLLED 
IT CERTAINLY IS 
THE FOLLOWING HOLE 
AT BEAUTIFUL TEE SHOT HE HOPED 
THE TREE LINE SET HIMSELF UP WITH 
THE WEDGE ABOUT TWELVE FEET LEFT OF 
THE FLAG YOU CAN SEE THE GREEN IS 
A LOT MORE RECEPTIVE AFTER THAT 
MORNING RAIN HE WOULD GO ON TO 
MAKE THAT HE FOLLOWED SNEDEKER 
WHO MADE BIRDIE BEFORE HIM THAT 
WAS A GOOD PUTT TO BACK UP HE HE FINISHED OFF IN SOME STYLE WHAT 
ABOUT THIS 
SNEDEKER PUT ONE UP 
THERE AND HE KNEW IT WAS CLOSE FROM 
THE APPLAUSE HE IS CALLING FOR IT 
TO GET DOWN BUT IT IS JUST A 
MAGNIFICENT SHOT IT RELEASES A 
LITTLE BIT 
WE LIKE THOSE 
A STROKE 
OF GOOD FORTUNE WE SAW IT JUST 
BEFORE AT FIFTEEN HAVE YOU SEEN BALL 
STOP LIKE THAT 
I THOUGHT IT WAS IN THE WATER L. 
HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE STOP THERE 
THAT COULD BE HIS FRED COUPLES 
MOMENT 
THERE IS A LOT OF GOLF TO MOMENT GO BUT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT 
DIFFERENCE BECAUSE HE HAS TO TAKE 
THE BALL BACK THE OTHER SIDE HE HE MADE FIVE AND IT WAS A POTENTIAL 
OR SIX AT THE BEST IF HE HAD GONE 
IN THE WATER 
IT IS A SCARY SHOT 
THIS AT THE BEST OF TIMES 
IT IS 
THE ONE THING YOU CANNOT GET ON THE 
TELEVISION IS HOW STEEP THE SLOPES 
ARE HE DOES NOT GIVE IT ENOUGH HE 
DOES NOT GET IT FAR ENOUGH THROUGH 
THE AIR THE GUYS SPIN THE BALL SO 
MUCH THESE DAYS AND AS SOON AS IT 
STARTED TO GO BACK 
YOU WERE 
TELLING ME IT WAS IN THE WATER HERE 
AND HERE AND EVEN NOW WHEN IT 
STARTED TO SLOW DOWN 
I STILL 
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING IN 
THAT HAS 
DEFIED GRAVITY 
IT HAS 
THE RAIN 
SAVED IT 
WE WILL GIVE THAT BANK 
AND EXTRA CUT TOMORROW MORNING 
PAUL CASEY TIGER WOODS STILL IN 
CONTENTION A BIT FURTHER BEHIND 
THAN THEY THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE 
CASEY PLAYED REALLY WELL TIGER HAS 
DONE NOTHING ALL WEEK HE IS IN A 
GOOD POSITION 
DID HE PLAY BETTER 
TODAY 
HE DID BUT HE WAS HELPED BY TODAY THE SOFT GREENS THERE IS A LOT OF 
GUYS IN FRONT OF HIM FOUR GUYS AND 
A LONG WAY TO GO 
FINAL THOUGHTS I DON'T THINK 
ANYONE BILLOWED TIGER HAS A CHANCE 
TOMORROW BELOW 
A SIX HORSE 
RACE 
IT IS A COLD AND WINDY DAY RACE TOMORROW SO IT WILL BE A DIFFICULT 
DAY 
EVEN FOR TIGER HE WILL NEED A DAY FAST START 
WE WILL SEE WHAT THEY 
WILL DO WITH PIN PLACEMENTS 
TOMORROW 
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE TOMORROW WINDY AS WELL 
THAT'S IT FROM US HERE AT AUGUSTA 
MASTERS UNTIL TOMORROW OF COURSE 
IT SHOULD BE TASTY
