APPEARED IN PUBLIC FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE SATURDAY'S ELECTIONS HE 
WAS SEEN ON STATE TELEVISION AS 
SPECULATION ABOUT THE RESULT OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CONTINUES 
SENIOR MEMBER OF MR. MUGABE'S ZANU 
P. F. PARTY INSISTS HE WILL CONTEST A 
SECOND ROUND OF VOTE F. G. THERE IS NO 
CLEAR WINNER THE B. B. C. IS BANNED 
FROM REPORTING FROM ZIMBABWE OUR 
WORLD AFFAIRS EDITOR JOHN SIMPSON 
IS THERE TONIGHT WE CAN JOIN HIM 
NOW WELL FIVE DAYS LATER THERE IS 
STILL NO RESULTS FROM THE 
PRESIDENTAL ELECTION AND IT LOOKS 
PRETTY CLEAR THAT WHAT PRESIDENT 
ROBERT MUGABE IS LOOKING FOR IS A 
RUN OFF ELECTION IN JUST OVER TWO 
WEEK'S TIME AGAINST HIS CHIEF RIVAL 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI OF THE M. D. C. THAT 
SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR WHAT IS LESS 
CLEAR ALL SORTS OF RUMOURS FLYING 
AROUND TONIGHT ABOUT ARRESTS AND 
THE SURROUNDING OF A HOTEL AND SO 
FORTH IN HARARE SOME OF IT TRUE 
SOME OF IT NOT WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY 
CLEAR IS THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS 
STARTED HIS FIGHT BACK IT WAS HIS 
FIRST OFFICIAL APPEARANCE SINCE THE 
ELECTION LAST SATURDAY AS ROBERT 
MUGABE GREETED SENIOR MEMBERS OF A 
FAEM OF AFRICAN ELECTION OBJECT 
SERVERS HE DIDN'T SOUND LIKE AL MAN ACCEPTING DEFEAT 
WE BELIEVE WE DON'T CHEAT HE IS SAYING AS FOR 
THE OPPOSITION HIS OFFICIALS 
WEREN'T GIVING UP EITHER WE ARE 
VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE'VE GOT THE 
NUMBERS WHEN IT COMES TO RERUN WE 
ARE READY FOR THAT SECOND ROUND WE 
ARE CONFIDENT THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE 
WILL WIN THIS TIME 
THE ELECTORAL 
TIRKS COMMISSION HAS UNTIL TOMORROW 
TO ANNOUNCE THE PRESIDENTAL RESULT 
BOTH B. T. THERE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTION 
IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN UNTIL MONDAY 
ZANU P. F. LEADERS MEET TOMORROW TO 
PLAN THEIR 
STRATEGY EVERYONE WILL 
BE WAITING TO SEE WHAT MR. MUGABE 
DOES IT IS ASSUMED HE WILL CHAIR 
THE MEETING IF A RUN OFF ELECTION 
IS CALLED THE LAW SAY THIS IS MUST 
TAKE PLACE WITHIN THREE WEEKS IT 
COULD MEAN THE INDEPENDENT 
CANDIDATE SIMBA MAKONI WOULD BE A 
KING MAKER IF HE SIDES WITH THE 
M. D. C. MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS LIKELY TO 
WIN IF HE PREFERS ZANU P. F. ROBERT 
MUGABE MIGHT CLING ON TO POWER 
THERE HAS BEEN TENSION IN THE 
CENTRE OF HARARE TODAY EVEN THOUGH 
THERE HAS BEEN LESS OF A SECURITY 
PRESENCE HERE THE POLICE RAIDED A 
GUEST HOUSE WHERE FOREIGNERS ARE 
STAYING THEY PICKED UP MEMBERS OF 
AN AMERICAN GROUP HELPING THE M. D. C. 
COLLATING THE ELECTION RESULTS 
MAYBE THE PLAN IS TO ACCUSE THE M. D. C. 
YET AGAIN OF BEING THE DUPES OF 
FOREIGN POWERS THE GOVERNMENT'S 
MAIN MOUTH PIECE THE HERALD WAS 
DOING THE SAME THIS MORNING PEOPLE 
AREN'T NECESSARILY CONVINCED I I THINK IT IS TIME FOR A CHANGE WE 
NEED A CHANGE 
BASICALLY THE 
ECONOMY IS SO LOW WE ARE HOPING 
FOR SOMETHING I MEAN WHICH 
REVIEFS THE ECONOMY 
IF THIS IS 
PART OF A FIGHT BACK BY ROBERT 
MUGABE CAN HE ENTIRELY TRUST HIS 
OWN SUPPORTERS THIS IS THE 
HEADQUARTERS OF ZANU P. F. ROBERT 
MUGABE'S POLITICAL PARTY LIKE HIM 
IT'S BEEN IN POWER FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS 
AND SHES LIKE HIM IT NOW FACES THE 
POSSIBILITY OF LOSING POWER 
TOMORROW IT'S TOP LEADERSHIP WILL 
BE MEETING AT THIS BUILDING TO 
DECIDE WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO 
THE LEADERSHIP IS CALLED AFTER THE 
OLD SOVIET DAYS THE POLITBURO EACH 
MEMBER MUST BE GETTING NERVOUS 
ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN L. 
SPOKE TO A SENIOR FIGURE IN ZANU P. F. 
ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PARTY 
LEADERSHIP WAS STILL BEHIND ROBERT 
MUGABE YOU WOULDN'T PUT ALL YOUR 
EGGS IN ONE BASKET CHANGE IS IN 
THE AIR CAN YOU FEEL HERE THE 
QUESTION IS WILL ROBERT MUGABE 
ACCEPT DEFEAT TAMELY AND STEP 
ASIDE ALL THIS EVIDENCE OF A FIGHT 
BACK TONIGHT SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT 
THE ANSWER WILL BE NO JOHN YOU 
ARE REFERRED THERE TO REPORTS OF 
RAIDS AND ARRESTED THERE WERE 
REPORTS EARLIER THIS EVENING THAT 
THE M. D. C. LEADERSHIP HAD GONE INTO 
HIDING WHAT IS THE LATEST YOU HAVE 
ON THAT SET OF REPORT THAT IS WE 
HAVE TONIGHT 
WELL TSVANGIRAI 
SPOKESMAN TOLD US JUST ABOUT HALF 
AN HOUR AGO THAT IT WASN'T TRUE 
THAT HIS BOSS FOR INSTANCE HRKS 
GONE INTO HIDING OR OTHER MEMBERS 
OF THE LEADERSHIP HAD HE STPAID 
THEY HAD HE WOULD HAVE GONE INTO 
HIDING TOOFPLT A SECOND JOURNALIST 
HAS BEEN ARRESTED THERE IS SOME 
TRUTH IN SOME OF THESE THINGS SOME 
NOT I THINK PROBABLY THE FURTHER 
AWAY YOU GET FROM HARARE SHES AS 
YOU GET TO THE SPOKESMAN AND ALL 
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BASED ABROAD 
FOR THE M. D. C. SO THE STORIES TEND TO 
RATHER GATHER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF 
STRENGTH NEVERTHELESS IT DOES 
LOOK PRETTY CLEAR THAT ROBERT 
MUGABE HAS DECIDED TO TAKE ACTION 
AGAINST PERHAPS SOME PARTS OF THE 
M. D. C. AND IN ORDER TO AS I SAID IN 
THE REPORT I THINK TO TRY TO 
SMEAR THE M. D. C. WITH BEING INFLUENCED 
AND PAID FOR BY FOREIGNERS L. THINK 
THAT WE CAN BE CERTAIN ABOUT THAT 
NO DOUBT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
THINGS ARE GOING TO GET WORSE 
PEOPLE HERE CERTAINLY THINK SO 
MANY THANKS

MILITARY ZONE 
IN LONDON'S 
TRAFALGAR SQUARE I MET ONE OF 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHINESE STUDENTS IN BRITAIN 
HE HAS BEEN RALLYING SUPPORTERS IN 
FAVOUR OF SUNDAY'S TORCH RELAY IT IT IS SOMETIMES VERY HARD TO SEPARATE 
POLITICAL ISSUES FROM OLYMPIC GAMES 
ESPECIALLY WHEN IN THE POLITICAL 
ISSUES ARE ARTIFICIALLY DISTORTED 
AND EXAGGERATED HOW TIBETAN CRISIS 
IN MY OPINION IS GREATLY 
EXAGGERATED 
BLAME THE MEDIA SAYS EXAGGERATED THIS PRO BEIJING LONDON NEWSPAPER 
IT ACCUSES THE B. B. C. OF 
MISUNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION IN 
TIBET TIBET NOT SURPRISINGLY THE CHINESE 
EMBASSY IS TAKING A CLOSE INTEREST 
IN SUNDAY'S OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY 
THIS IS AFTER ALL THEIR SHOWCASE 
YEAR WHEN IT COMES TO SECURITY 
IT'S NOT THEM BUT THE METROPOLITAN 
POLICE WHO WILL BE SAFEGUARDING THE 
PASSAGE OF THE FLAME THROUGH LONDON 
AND OF HUNDREDS OF EXPECTED 
DEMONSTRATORS DEMONSTRATORS THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF PROTEST 
WEBSITES ON THE INTERNET THE 
POLICE WARN THEY WILL HAVE CHINESE 
INTERPRETERS ON HAND ON SUNDAY IN 
CITEFUL BAN YERSTIERS WILL BE CON 
DEPIS INDICATED DURING THE DAY 
CHINESE LEADERS WITH THE TARGETS OF 
SEVERE CRITICISM FROM THE WORLD 
COMMUNITY AFTER A PROM DANT

BEIJING OLYMPICS THIS MORNING HIS 
LAWYER CAME TO COURT TO HEAR HIS 
CLIENTS SENTENCE 
HIS LAWYER IS ABOUT TO GO INTO THE

TO HAVE TO WAIT HERE AND THEN FIND 
OUT WHAT THE LAWYER SAYS WHEN HE 
COMES OUT OF THE COURT AFTER THE 
VERDICT WHEN CHINA BID FOR THE 
OLYMPICS SEVERAL YEARS AGO IT 
PROMISED GAMES WOULD HELP THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
OUTSIDE THE COURT TODAY THAT 
PROMISE SEEMED TO BE FORGOTTEN 
AFTER TWENTY MINUTES HIS LAWYER COMES 
BACK OUT 
HE DIDN'T SEE SINGLE WORD DURING 
THE HEARING THE LAWYER SAYS 
HE WAS SENTENCED TO THREE AND A 
HALF YEARS IN JAIL 
THEN A WOMAN NEARBY STARTS TO CRY 
OUT THESE PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE 
FOR US TO HEAR THEIR OWN CASES MY 
SON WAS KILLED THIRTEEN YEARS AGO WE 
HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY JUSTICE 
AFTER THE VERDICT HIS WIFE IS 
OVERWHELMED 
AWAY FROM THE CROWD HER MOTHER 
HOLDS THE BABY WILL YOUR HUSBAND 
AND YOU CARRY ON CAMPAIGNING OR 
WILL YOU NOW STOP 
THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THING AT THIS MOMENT FOR 
ME IS HOW TO SURVIVE AND HOW TO GET 
MY HUSBAND BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
BUT THAT WILL BE HARD HE IS IN 
JAIL HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER NOW GO 
BACK UNDER HOUSE ARREST THE 
COMMUNIST PARTY HAD HOPED TO 
SILENCE HIM INSTEAD IT HAS MADE 
HIM AND HIS FAMILY SYMBOLS OF A 
BROKEN OLYMPIC PROMIES PROMIES 
THE IMAGES WHICH SHOW HOW A 
COOLING OCEAN CURRENT IS SET TO 
CAUSE GLOBAL TEMPERATURES TO FALL 
THIS YEAR 
LABOUR'S KEN LIVINGSTONE WHO IS 
RUNNING FOR A THIRD TERM AS MAYOR 
OF LONDON SAYS HIS CAMPAIGN WILL 
NOT BE AFFECTED BY REVELATION THAT 
IS HE HAS FIVE CHILDREN BY THREE 
DIFFERENT PARTNERS HE INSIST THAT 
IS VOTERS HAVE NEVER TAKEN AN 
INTEREST IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE KEN 
IS IN A TOUGH BAT WELL 
THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE BUDGET 
WHOSE PRIVATE LIFE HAS BEEN 
HEADLINE NEWS IN RECENT YEARS 
FOR MORE THAN FOUR DECADES KEN 
LIVINGSTONE HAS BROUGHT A DASH OF 
COLOUR TO THE GREY PALETTE OF 
BRITISH POLITICS A MAVERICK 
COUNCIL LEADERS METROPOLITAN 
POLICE AND MAYOR HE SURROUNDED 
HIMSELF WITH QUESTIONABLE CRONIES 
AND CON SORTED WITH CONTROVERSIAL 
ISLAMIC CLERICS AND UNFASHIONABLE 
FOREIGN LEAD ERSZ CONSISTENTLY HE 
HAS REFUSED TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT 
HIS PRIVATE LIFE IT HAS BEEN KNOWN 
HE HAS TWO CHILDREN WITH HIS 
CURRENT PARTNER IT HAS EMERGED HE 
ALSO HAS TWO OLDER DAUGHTERS FROM 
ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP AND A SON FROM 
OTHER IT IS ALL HE SAYS NOTHING 
TO DO WITH US 
I DON'T THINK 
ANYBODY IN THE CITY IS SHOCKED 
ABOUT WHAT CONSENTING ADULTS DO AS 
LONG AS YOU DON'T INVOLVE CHILDREN 
ANIMALS AND VEGETABLES THEY LET 
PEOPLE TO GET ON TO LIVE THEIR OWN 
LIFE IN THEIR OWN WAY THERE IS A 
DIFFERENT BETWEEN PRIVATE AND 
SECRET IF I HAVE SECRETS THAT MY 
FAMILY OR CLOSE FRIENDS DIDN'T KNOW 
ABOUT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER MATTER 
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
PRIVATE AND SECRET THE MEDIA HAS 
TO UNDERTAN THAT 
THIS CONTEST HAS 
YET TO GET UGLY PLFPLT 
LIVINGSTONE'S RIVAL BUDGET WHO WAS 
SACK FRDS THE CONSERVATIVE 
FRONTBENCH FOR LIE BEING AN AFFAIR 
TONIGHT REFUSED TO MAKE ANY COMMENT 
ABOUT THIS NOTHING TOO FROM THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE BRIAN 
PADDICK WHO WAS UNTIL RECENTLY 
BRITAIN'S HIGHEST PROFILE GAY 
POLICEMAN IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW 
WHAT IMPACT THIS COULD HAVE THE 
CHARACTER OF A CANDIDATE COULD MAT 
NER A ELECTION THAT HAS BEEN 
DOMINATED MORE BY PERSONALITY THAN 
POLICY IT COULD BE IRRELEVANT IN A 
MODERN METROPOLITAN CITY THAT HAS 
SEEN FAR WORSE GLOBAL TEMPERATURES 
ARE SET TO DROP THIS YEAR DESPITE 
THE FEAR ABOUTS CLIMATE CHANGE THE 
CONFIRMATION CAME TODAY FROM THE 
WORLD'S LEADING METEOROLOGISTS WHO 
SPOKE TO THE B. B. C. THE GENERAL TREND 
OF GLOBAL WARMING REMAINS UPWARDS 
IN CHINA IT'S BEEN A FEROCIOUS 
WINTER ONE OF THE TOUGHEST ON 
RECORD SCIENTISTS THINK THAT THE 
COOL PACIFIC CURRENT HAS DRIVEN 
DOWN THE TEMPERATURE SENDING GLOBAL 
WARMING TEMPORARILY INTO REVERSE 
IN AUSTRALIA IT IS BLAMED FOR 
SEVERE FLOODING IN AREAS THAT WERE 
PREVIOUSLY STRICKEN BY DROUGHT 
WEATHER EXPERTS HAVE BEEN PLOTTING 
OCEAN TEMPERATURES ON A COMPUTER 
MAP MAP THIS ANIMATION MADE FOR B. B. C. NEWS 
SHOWS THE BLUE TONGUE OF LA NINA 
SPREADING ACROSS THE PACIFIC OVER 
THE PAST YEAR OR SO IT IS ONE OF 
TWO DISRUPTIVE CURRENTS IN THE 
PACIFIC THE OTHER IS THE ELNINO 
CURRENT THAT WARMS THE WORLD THIS 
IS HOW IT HAS SUPER HEATED THE 
OCEAN IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT TO DRIVE GLOBAL 
TEMPERATURES TO RECORD LEVELS BOTH 
CURRENTS ARE ENTIRELY NATURAL SO 
HOW MUCH LONGER WILL THIS YEAR'S LA 
NINA EVENT BRING COLD WEATHER TO 
THE PACIFIC REGION 
IT'S AN 
INTENSIVE EVENT THIS YEAR THE 
STRONEST WE HAVE HAD FOR TWENTY YEARS 
WE EXPECT IT TO CONTINUE THROUGH 
INTO SUMMER BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A 
STRONG EVENT 
SO IT WILL COOL THE 
WORLD A LITTLE HOW WILL THAT WILL 
AFFECT LONG TERM TRENDS AS CAN YOU 
SEE THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY RISE 
THIS CENTURY GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS 
SAY IT IS MAINLY DUE TO GREENHOUSE 
GASES HERE IS THE PEAK OF THE 
TEMPERATURE 
TEMPERATURE TREND PROTJECTED DIP 
CAUSED BY THE COOLING CURRENT WILL 
STILL SEE TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE 
THE AVERAGE FOR THE PAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT CLIMATE CHANGE YOU 
SHOULD NOT LOOK AT ANY PARTICULAR 
YEAR YOU SHOULD LOOK AT TRENDS OVER 
PRETTY LONG PERIOD THE TREND OF 
TEMPERATURE GLOBELY IS STILL VERY 
MUCH INDICATIVE OF WARMING 
IT IS PART OF WHAT WE CALL 
VIABILITY THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AND 
THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN COOLER AND 
WARMER YEAR WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR 
CLIMATE CHANGE IS THAT THE TREND IS 
UP 
A MINORITY OF SCIENTISTS WOND UP FER THE CURRENT STABILISING OF 
WORLD TEMPERATURES MEANS THAT 
CLIMATE CHANGE HAS PEAKED THAT THE 
WORLD IS MORE RESILIENT THAN WE 
THOUGHT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF 
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THOUGH THAT AS 
WE KEEP INCREASING GREENHOUSE GASES 
SO TEMPERATURE WILL CONTINUE TO 
RISE AFTER THIS YEAR'S MINOR DIP 
NATO LEADERS HAVE PROMISED TO SEND 
ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND TROOPS AND EIGHTEEN 
HELICOPTERS TO AFGHANISTAN FRANCE 
AND THE UNITED STATES WILL SUPPLY 
THE EXTRA SOLDIERS AND COUNTRIES 
NOT PROVIDING TRIPS HAVE PLEDGED TO 
PAY INTO A NEW FUND TO SUPPORT THE 
MILITARY EFFORT NOT PROVIDING 
TROOPS NATO LEADERS ALSO ENDORSED 
AMERICAN PLANS FOR A MISSILE SHIELD 
IN EUROPE BUT TURNED DOWN 
MEMBERSHIP FOR THE UKRAINE AND 
GEORGIA FOR THE TIME BEING 
THE PRIME MINISTER IS SAID TO BE 
DETERMINED TO TIGHTEN THE LAW ON 
CANNABIS AGAINST THE ADVICE OF AN 
INDEPENDENT PANEL OF EXPERTS B. B. C. 
NEWS HAS BEEN TOLD THAT THE PANEL 
THE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE MISUSE 
OF DRUGS DECIDED THAT CANNABIS 
SHOULD REMAIN AS A CLASS C. DRUG 
BUT SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS INSIST 
THAT CANNABIS MUST BE UPGRADED TO 
CLASS B. TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT IT 
IS ILLEGAL AND DANGEROUS MARK 
EASTON AS MORE DETAILS 
IT MIGHT COME AS A SURPRISE BUT 
SINCE CANNABIS WAS DOWNGRADED 
GOVERNMENT FIGURES SUGGEST A 
SIGNIFICANT FALL IN ITS USE IN 
TWO THOUSAND THREE JUST BEFORE DOWNGRADING ELEVEN PER CENT 
OF ADULTS REPORTED USING THE DRUG 
LAST YEAR IT WAS EIGHT PER CENT AMONG YOUNGER 
PEOPLE SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS REPORTED 
USE FELL FROM TWENTY FIVE PER CENT DOWN TO TWENTY ONE PER CENT THAT 
IS STILL ONE IN FIVE AND MANY MORE 
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BEING TREATED FOR 
CANNABIS PROBLEMS PARTICULARLY USE 
OF THE POWERFUL SKUNK FORM OF THE 
DRUG DRUG CANNABIS CONTAINS TWO KEY 
INGREDIENTS T. H. C. AND CANNABINOIDS 
SKUNK UNLIKE TRADITION OF CANNABIS 
HAS HIGH LEVELS OF T. H. SEE A RECENT 
B. B. C. DOCUMENTARY COMPARED THE 
EFFECTS OF EACH T. H. C. INJECTED 
WITH A MIXTURE PRESENTER NICKY 
TAYLOR BECAME RELAXED AND GIGGLY 
BUT A DOSE OF PURE T. H. SEE MADE HER 
FEEL PERSECUTED AND SUICIDAL T. H. C. 
IT IS JUST SO DEPRESSING YOU WOULD 
WANT TO TOP YOURSELF 
BOBBY IS 
RECOVERING FROM ADDICTION TO SKUNK 
CANNABIS AND BELIEVES IT IS MUCH 
MORE HARMFUL THAN PEOPLE REALISE I I REALLY LOST THE PLOT AND STARTED 
HEARING VOICES HAD TO BE SECTIONED 
I DON'T THINK EVERYONE GOES THAT 
WAY BUT IN MY OPINION IT 
DEFINITELY HAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL 
EFFECT ON SOMEONE WHO USES IT 
HEAVILY DEFINITELY 
NEW RESEARCH 
THOUGH PRESENTED TO THE BODY WHICH 
HAS BITERS ADVISES GOVERNMENT ON 
DRUG CLASSIFICATION FINDS THAT WHEN 
CANNABIS USE WAS GOING OUT 
SCHIZOPHRENIA RATES WERE GOING DOWN 
IT IS THOUGHT THIS EVIDENCE WAS 
CRITICAL IN ADVISERS DECIDING 
AGAINST RECLASSIFYING CANNABIS THE THE CONTINUING POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP 
AROUND CANNABIS RECLASSIFICATION IS 
A DISTRACTION FROM THE BIGGER 
ISSUES AROUND HOW WE DEAL WITH 
PROBLEMATIC DRUG USE CURRENTLY CURRENTLY DRUGS INCLUDING HEROIN AND ECSTASY 
ARE CLASS A CLASS B. INCLUDES 
AMPHETAMINES AND CANNABIS IS IN 
CLASS C. LAST YEAR INDEPENDENT 
EXPERTS COMPARED DRUGS ON THE HARM 
THEY CAUSE UNDER THAT RATING 
SYSTEM ECSTASY MOVED DOWN THE 
SCALE WHILE LEGAL DRUGS ALCOHOL 
AND TOBACCO ARE REGARDED AS MORE 
HARMFUL THAN CANNABIS 
GIVEN THE 
CHANGING NATURE OF THE STOCK OF 
CANNABIS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY 
AND THE GREATER DAMAGE IT APPEARS 
TO BE DOING TO PEOPLE WHO USE IT 
THERE IS A STRONGER CASE FOR 
SENDING OUT A SIGNAL THAT CANNABIS 
IS NOT ONLY ILLEGAL BUT 
UNACCEPTABLE 
GORDON BROWN'S VIEW UNACCEPTABLE THAT CANNABIS SHOULD BE 
RECLASSIFIED IS SHARED BY MANY 
POLICE OFFICERS BUT IT SEEMS 
INEVITABLE THAT HE WILL BE AT ODDS 
WITH HIS OWN GOVERNMENT'S EXPERT 
ADVICE PROMPTING A NEW DEBATE ON 
THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE THE HARM 
DRUGS CAUSE 
THE MODEL KATE NAOMI CAMPBELL WAS
