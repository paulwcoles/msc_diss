SHOUT SHOUT UP WITH YOUR SONG 
CRY WITH THE WIND FOR THE DAWN IS BREAKING 
MARCH MARCH SWING YOU ALONG 
WIDE BLOWS OUR BANNER AND HOPE IS WAKING 
FIRM IN RELIANCE LAUGH OUR DEFIANCE 
LAUGH IN HOPE FOR SURE IS THE END 
MARCH MARCH MANY AS ONE 
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER AND FRIEND TO FRIEND 
ENGLAND ARISE NOW LONG THE NIGHT IS OVER 
LIGHT IN THE EAST BEHOLD THE DAWN APPEARS 
A BIG FAMILY THE KENNEYS 
ELEVEN OF US I'M THE FIFTH 
WE LIVE IN A VILLAGE IN THE VALLEY 
SUNDAY AFTERNOONS WE GO FOR LONG WALKS 
SOMETIMES PEOPLE THOUGHT WE WERE A SUNDAY SCHOOL OUTING 
SO MANY OF US 
WE'D WALK FOR MILES TO SEE THE FIRST SPRING FLOWER 
AND IN THE EVENINGS MY MOTHER WOULD READ TO US 
SOMEHOW THE STORIES WERE ALWAYS ABOUT THE POOR PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN LONDON 
THE ALLEY INTO WHICH HE TURNED MIGHT FOR FILTH AND MISERY 
HAVE COMPETED WITH THE DARKEST CORNER OF THIS ANCIENT SANCTUARY 
IN ITS DIRTIEST AND MOST LAWLESS TIME 
THE HOUSES VARYING FROM TWO STOREY TO FOUR 
WERE STAINED WITH EVERY INDESCRIBABLE HUE THAT LONG EXPOSURE TO THE WEATHER 
DAMP AND ROTTENNESS COULD IMPART TO TENEMENTS 
COMPOSED ORIGINALLY OF THE ROUGHEST AND COARSEST MATERIALS 
THE WINDOWS WERE PATCHED WITH PAPER AND STUFFED WITH THE FOULEST RAGS 
THE DOORS WERE HANGING FROM THEIR HINGES 
POLES WITH LINES ON WHICH TO DRY CLOTHES PROJECTED FROM EVERY CASEMENT 
AND SOUNDS OF QUARRELING AND DRUNKENNESS ISSUED FROM EVERY ROOM 
I THINK IT WAS MY MOTHER'S IDEA MY SISTER AND I JOINED THE CHOIR 
WELL IT WASN'T MY IDEA I CAN'T SING 
POVERTY AND SCORN 
FIGHTING IN VAIN FOR FREEDOM YOUR GREAT MOTHER 
RISING REFRESHED IN EACH NEW RISING MORN 
COME AND SWELL THE SONG 
SILENT NOW SO LONG 
ENGLAND IS RISEN AND THE DAY IS HERE 
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THAT WAS SPLENDID 
YOU'VE EARNED A SHORT REST WHILE I TRY TO REMEMBER WHERE I'VE PUT THAT NEW MUSIC 
OH I AM TIRED 
OH ANNIE ARE YOU FREE NEXT THURSDAY EVENING NEXT THURSDAY 
OH MR. BALFOUR'S PROMISED TO TAKE ME TO THE MIDLAND HOTEL FOR DINNER 
TORY PRIME MINISTERS ALWAYS LET YOU DOWN YOU KNOW THAT IS IT SOMETHING EXCITING 
WELL JANE'S INVITED US TO A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COUNCIL 
WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THAT THEY'VE GOT TWO GUEST SPEAKERS COMING 
TERESA BILLINGTON AND CHRISTABEL PANKHURST TALKING ABOUT WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE 
CHRISTABEL IS THAT MISS PANKHURST'S DAUGHTER 
I HEARD HER MOTHER SPEAK ONCE I NEVER UNDERSTOOD A WORD SHE SAID 
BACK TO WORK PLEASE 
I'LL COME IF IT DOESN'T RAIN 
RIGHT 
WE'LL SING THE PATRIOT'S HYMN 
NOW WE HAVE BEEN ACCUSED NOT WITHOUT REASON 
OF BEING A MIDDLE CLASS ORGANISATION PURSUING MIDDLE CLASS AIMS 
LET ME DENY THAT ACCUSATION HERE AND NOW 
THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER BATTLE ON A MUCH LARGER BATTLEFIELD 
CONSIDER THE AVERAGE MIDDLE CLASS LADY OF LEISURE 
SHE IS WARM SHE IS COMFORTABLE AND WELL FED 
SHE HAS A HUSBAND TO WORK FOR HER 
SERVANTS TO SAVE HER FROM SOILING HER HANDS 
TELL HER SHE IS DISENFRANCHISED AND SHE'LL WONDER WHAT THE WORD MEANS AND BE MUCH TOO POLITE TO ASK 
CONSIDER THE WORKING CLASS WOMAN 
SHE BRINGS UP HER OWN CHILDREN LOOKS AFTER HER HUSBAND 
CLEANS THE HOUSE AND VERY LIKELY WORKS A LONG SHIFT AT THE MILL AS WELL 
ISN'T THIS THE WOMAN WHO IS ENTITLED TO A SAY IN HOW THE WORLD HER WORLD IS ORGANISED 
IN THE VOICE OF THE POET 
WE'RE FAR TO LOW TO VOTE THE TAX BUT WE'RE NOT TOO LOW TO PAY 
IN THE PAST WE HAVE SAID TO OUR GOVERNMENTS 
ARE YOU IN FAVOUR OF WOMEN HAVING THE VOTE 
AND THEY SMILE NOD THEIR HEADS GRAVELY AND AGREE 
YES THEY ARE IN 
FAVOUR BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE OTHER MORE PRESSING PROBLEMS 
AN ELECTION TO WIN OR A WAR TO FIGHT AND WOMEN MUST TAKE THEIR TURN 
THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR SOMETIME NEVER 
AND SO WE HAVE CHANGED THE QUESTION 
NOW THE QUESTION IS 
WILL YOU GIVE US THE VOTE 
AND WE WILL DEMAND THE ANSWER 
YES 
MISS PANKHURST YES 
I JUST WANTED TO SAY HOW MUCH I ENJOYED YOUR SPEECH 
I'M NOT SO MUCH CONCERNED WITH ENJOYMENT 
DID YOU AGREE WITH ME EVERY WORD 
WHAT CAN YOU DO TO HELP US HELP YOU 
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN PEOPLE WHO SMILE NOD THEIR HEADS BRAVELY AND WALK AWAY 
YOU SAID THAT IN YOUR SPEECH WE'RE THE NEW KIND OF POLITICIAN 
WE SAY THE SAME THINGS UP THERE AND DOWN HERE 
I'M A MILL WORKER AND I'M ACTIVE IN THE TRADE UNION 
THERE'S NO REASON WHY I COULDN'T ORGANISE SOME MEETINGS 
SEVERAL MEETINGS IF YOU LIKE 
WITH FACTORY WOMEN WORKING WOMEN 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME DEAR ANNIE ANNIE KENNEY 
ANNIE TO YOUR FRIENDS 
I AM CHRISTABEL TO MINE

CHRISTABEL TELLS ME YOU'RE GOING TO WORK MIRACLES FOR US ON THE FACTORY FLOOR I SHALL DO ME BEST 
MY SISTER SYLVIA HELLO ANNIE HOW DO YOU DO MISS PANKHURST 
SYLVIA SYLVIA'S MOVED TO LONDON SHE'S ONLY HOME FOR THE WEEKEND 
TERESA BILLINGTON WHO YOU MET THE OTHER EVENING

TOTAL LACK OF RESPECT 
COME AND SIT DOWN I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO MEET ANNIE KENNEY 
WELL NOW 
TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF 
EVERYTHING EVERYTHING 
SHALL I LEAVE OUT THE RUDE BITS 
THANK YOU 
WE'RE A BIG FAMILY THE KENNEYS 
ELEVEN OF US AND I'M THE FIFTH 
WE LIVE IN A VILLAGE IN THE VALLEY 
WHEN WE GO WALKING ON SUNDAYS SOMETIMES WE'RE MISTAKEN FOR 
IS THAT WHERE YOU WORK 
BY THOSE CHIMNEYS YEAH 
STARTED PART TIME WHEN I WAS TEN FULL TIME THIRTEEN 
SWEATED LABOUR AS SYLVIA WOULD SAY 
IT DID GET A BIT WARM SOMETIMES 
SO YOU STARTED WORK IN THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT 
OH I JUST TALK TOO MUCH WHEN THE GIRLS WANTED A SPOKESWOMAN THEY PICKED ONE THAT TALKS TOO MUCH 
SENSIBLE PEOPLE KEEP QUIET AND WALK AWAY NOT ME 
THE MOUTH FLIES OPEN WORDS TUMBLE OUT IT CAN BE A NUISANCE SOMETIMES 
YOUR MOTHER SOUNDS LIKE A MARVELLOUS WOMAN 
SHE WAS 
I'M SORRY 
YES SHE DIED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 
I MISS HER A LOT 
WE WERE VERY CLOSE 
LIKE YOU AND YOUR MOTHER I THINK 
IT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO DO SOMETHING 
IT WAS A STRUGGLE BRINGING UP ELEVEN OF US IT'S ALWAYS A STRUGGLE 
I LOVE THAT STORY ABOUT HER READING TO YOU ON SUNDAY EVENINGS 
THAT WASN'T A STORY THAT WAS TRUE 
AND SHE ENCOURAGED US TO READ 
WE HAD A HOUSE FULL OF BOOKS 
THERE WAS TOM PAINE AND CARPENTER 
FLATCHFORD AND WALT WALT WHITMAN WE'VE GOT THE SAME BOOKS 
I CAN RECITE GREAT CHUNKS OF POETRY IF NOBODY STOPS ME 
NOBODY'S STOPPING YOU 
HEY DO YOU KNOW THE GREAT CITY 
I LIVE IN IT IT'S CALLED MANCHESTER 
MANCHESTER NEAR OLDHAM WE SAY 
WALT WHITMAN'S GREAT CITY 
WHERE WOMEN WALK IN PUBLIC PROCESSIONS IN THE STREETS 
THE SAME AS MEN 
WHERE THEY ENTER PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES 
THERE THE GREAT CITY STANDS 
IT'S MY FATHER'S FAVOURITE POEM 
AND THAT ONE YOU QUOTED AT THE TRADES COUNCIL I KNOW HUNDREDS OF VERSES OF THAT ONE WHICH ONE 
DOWN DOWN WE GO SO VERY VERY LOW TO THE DEPTHS OF THE DEEP SUNK MINE 
AND WE GATHER THE PROUDEST GEMS THAT GLOW 
WHEN THE CROWN OF THE DESPOT CHIMES 
AND WHEN HE LACKS UPON OUR BACKS FRESH LOADS HE DEIGNS TO LAY 
WE'RE NOT TOO 
NO WE'RE FAR TOO LOW TO VOTE THE TAX 
BUT WE'RE NOT TOO LOW TO PAY 
HEY AND THAT ONE ABOUT THE WEAVERS 
WE'RE LOW WE'RE LOW WE'RE VERY VERY LOW 
BUT FROM OUR FINGERS GLIDE THE SILKEN FLOW 
AND THE ROBES THAT GLOW 
ROUND THE LIMBS OF THE SONS OF PRIDE 
AND WHAT WE GET AND WHAT WE GIVE WE KNOW AND WE KNOW OUR SHARE 
WE'RE NOT TOO LOW TO WEAVE THE CLOTH 
BUT TOO LOW THE CLOTH TO WEAR 
I COULD GO ON FOR EVER IT'S MY CHRISTMAS RECITATION 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
WE'RE NOT REALLY TOO LOW TO WALK IN THE GREAT CITY ARE WE 
WHAT A FUNNY GIRL YOU ARE I KNOW 
SOME PEOPLE SAY SO AND I HIT 'EM 
EVERY TIME WE GO WALKING WE MUST TAKE A NOTEBOOK AND PENCIL 
AND WRITE DOWN ALL THE IMPORTANT IDEAS WE DISCUSS DO YOU AGREE 
DON'T HAVE MANY IDEAS OF ME OWN 
MOSTLY OTHER PEOPLE'S 
YES I AGREE 
ONE THING YOU COULD WRITE DOWN WHEN YOU GET YOUR NOTEBOOK 
WHAT DATES 
DATES OF THE MEETINGS I'M ORGANISING 
I'M SPEAKING FOR THE WOMEN WHO WORK IN THE MILL 
THE WEAVERS THE CARD ROOM WORKERS RINGSPINNERS WINDERS 
WOMEN WHO WORK TEN HOURS A DAY AND THEN GO BACK AND LOOK AFTER THEIR HUSBANDS 
THEIR HOME AND A HOUSE FULL OF CHILDREN 
WOMEN WHO WORK IN THE SWEATED HOME TRADES 
FOURTEEN HOURS A DAY FOR SIX SHILLING A WEEK 
THIS IS THE WORLD THAT MEN HAVE MADE FOR US AND THIS IS THE WORLD WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE 
WHEN WE GET THE VOTE QUESTION MISSUS 
I'LL ANSWER ANY QUESTION WHAT ABOUT HORSES 
WHAT ABOUT HORSES WHY SHOULDN'T HORSES HAVE THE VOTE THAT HORSE OF YOURS TALKS MORE SENSE THAN YOU DO 
AYE AND HE WORKS A LOT HARDER THAN YOU DO AND HE DRINKS LESS 
I TELL YOU WHAT MISSUS IF I WERE MARRIED TO YOU I'D PUSH YOU OFF BLACKPOOL TOWER 
I TELL YOU WHAT MISTER 
IF I WERE MARRIED TO YOU I'D JUMP OFF BLACKPOOL TOWER 
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE DAYS 
OH MY GOODNESS ANNIE 
GOOD MORNING 
ANNIE I HEAR GREAT THINGS OF THE WORK YOU'RE DOING 
DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ IN THE PAPERS I DON'T I BELIEVE WHAT MY DAUGHTER TELLS ME 
ANNIE'S WONDERFUL OH GO ON I'M ORDINARY 
CHRISTABEL'S USUALLY RIGHT 
WELL OLDHAM WASN'T VERY WONDERFUL 
WHAT HAPPENED AT OLDHAM I ORGANISED THIS BIG MEETING FOR CHRISTABEL 
SENT OUT PAMPHLETS CHALKED ON PAVEMENTS DID ALL THE USUAL THINGS 
I EVEN GOT MR. CHATTERTON TO LET THE CHOIR COME ALONG AND SING 
GET 'EM IN A GOOD MOOD FOR CHRISTABEL'S SPEECH 
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE CHOIR THERE'D HAVE BEEN NO ONE THERE 
ANNIE'S EXAGGERATING AS USUAL 
IT'S HER ONLY WEAKNESS SHE LIKES TO MAKE UP GOOD STORIES 
IT WAS NEARLY TRUE THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE THERE BESIDES THE CHOIR 
THERE WERE TWO FRIENDS OF MY SISTERS AND A TABBY CAT THAT CHASED IN A MOUSE 
DIDN'T SEE THE MOUSE DID YOU MOUSE I'M GLAD I WASN'T THERE 
IT'S A HARD LIFE IN OLDHAM THERE WON'T BE ROOM FOR A MOUSE AT THE FREE TRADE HALL 
EXCEPT ON THE PLATFORM 
FREE TRADE HALL WE'RE NOT HOLDING A MEETING AT THE FREE TRADE HALL ARE WE 
NOT US THE LIBERALS 
WINSTON CHURCHILL AND SIR EDWARD GREY ROUSING THE ELECTORATE READY FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION 
I SHAN'T GO TO THAT I'VE HEARD ALL THAT BEFORE WE ALL HAVE 
YOU'RE GOING ANNIE AND SO AM I 
IS IT COMPULSORY 
WELL YOU SEE SOMEBODY HAS TO ASK THE QUESTION 
IF YOU ARE ELECTED WILL YOU DO YOUR BEST TO MAKE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE A GOVERNMENT MEASURE 
THAT'S A VERY CUNNING QUESTION 
IS IT IF WINSTON CHURCHILL SAYS YES THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE COMMITTED 
AND THEN IF HE SAYS NO THE LIBERAL WOMEN WILL WANT TO KNOW THE REASON WHY OH 
IS THAT YOUR QUESTION 
WELL SAY THEY IGNORE IT OR REFUSE TO ANSWER 
WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM ANSWER 
YOU MEAN WE ASK A QUESTION AND THEN WE WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
THINK FAST THAT'S WHY WHY WE'RE GOING 
NOT FRIGHTENED ARE YOU 
IF I CAN HOLD MEETINGS AT FACTORY GATES A FEW LIBERALS DON'T WORRY ME 
BUT YOU KNOW THE REASON ANNIE 
I'M A WORKING WOMAN TOO 
I KNOW YOU'RE THE BREADWINNER MRS. PANKHURST 
MY EMPLOYERS HAVE THREATENED THAT IF I CONTINUE WITH MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES THEY'LL DISMISS ME 
UNHAPPILY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME BLITHELY TO IGNORE THAT THREAT 
NO SHOUTING FROM THE GALLERY AT THE FREE TRADE HALL 
PRECISELY 
I DON'T MIND 
I'LL SHOUT AT ANYBODY THANK YOU 
NEXT QUESTION PLEASE 
IF YOU ARE ELECTED WILL YOU DO YOUR BEST TO MAKE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE A GOVERNMENT MEASURE 
MAY WE HAVE THE NEXT QUESTION PLEASE 
YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED OUR QUESTION 
IF YOU ARE ELECTED WILL YOU DO YOUR BEST TO MAKE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE A GOVERNMENT MEASURE 
GENTLEMAN AT THE BACK OF THE HALL DOWNSTAIRS 
IF YOU ARE ELECTED WILL YOU DO YOUR BEST TO MAKE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE A GOVERNMENT MEASURE 
MAY WE HAVE YOUR QUESTIONS WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF 
WHAT IS THE LIBERAL PARTY FRIGHTENED OF IF ELECTED WILL YOU MAKE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE A GOVERNMENT MEASURE 
HOW ARE YOU PREPARED TO SEE THIS HAPPENING IN YOUR COUNTRY 
MISS KENNEY AND MISS PANKHURST ARE CHARGED WITH DISORDERLY BEHAVIOUR IN A STREET 
AND MISS PANKHURST IS ALSO CHARGED WITH ASSAULTING THE POLICE WICKED WOMAN 
IT IS KNOWN THAT A MEETING WAS HELD LAST NIGHT AT WHICH MANY SPEAKERS WERE GIVING THEIR VIEWS 
THE DEFENDANTS HAD EVIDENTLY SET OUT WITH A FIRM INTENTION OF CREATING A DISTURBANCE 
DURING THE MEETING THE DEFENDANTS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ANXIOUS TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE SPEAKERS 
AND AT ONE PERIOD OF THE MEETING ONE OR BOTH OF THE DEFENDANTS 
MOUNTED THE SEAT UPON WHICH THEY WERE SITTING AND YELLED AND SHRIEKED TO THE UTMOST OF THEIR ABILITY 
IT MUST'VE BEEN YOU I WAS FRIGHTENED OF WILL YOU BE QUIET 
THE SHRIEKING AND SHOUTING BECAME SUCH THAT THE ATTENDANT EJECTED THEM 
THE DEFENDANTS WERE THEN TAKEN TO AN ANTE ROOM AND ASKED TO RESTRAIN THEMSELVES 
MISS PANKHURST SPAT IN THE FACE OF SUPERINTENDENT WATSON AND ALSO STRUCK HIM 
THEY WERE THEN PUT OUT INTO THE STREET AND ASKED TO GO AWAY QUIETLY 
BUT THEY REFUSED AND BEGAN TO SCREAM AGAIN 
AND CAUSED A LARGE CROWD TO COLLECT 
THE POLICE BECAME DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN TO THE POLICE STATION 
IF THE EVIDENCE IS TRUE 
THE DEFENDANTS BEHAVED MORE LIKE WOMEN FROM THE SLUMS 
IN SPITE OF THIS THERE IS NO DESIRE THAT A HEAVY PENALTY SHOULD BE INFLICTED 
BUT THE MAGISTRATES WILL BE ASKED TO TAKE SUCH MEANS AS TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE OF SUCH A SCENE 
MURMURS OF AGREEMENT 
I HAVE NO INTENTION OF DENYING THE MAIN POINTS MADE BY THE PROSECUTION 
IN DEFENCE OF MY ACTIONS I BELIEVE THEY WERE JUSTIFIED 
BECAUSE OF THE TREATMENT I RECEIVED AT THE HANDS OF SIR EDWARD GREY 
AND OTHER SPEAKERS AT THE FREE TRADE HALL 
AT THE TIME I ASSAULTED THE POLICE OFFICERS 
I WAS UNAWARE THAT THEY WERE POLICE OFFICERS 
I THOUGHT THEY WERE LIBERALS 
MY DEEPEST REGRET IS THAT ONE OF THE MEN I ASSAULTED WAS NOT SIR EDWARD GRAY HIMSELF 
I SPAT IN THE OFFICER'S FACE BECAUSE MY ARMS WERE HELD AND I COULD NOT HIT HIM 
I ATTENDED THE MEETING TO PROTEST IN A PROPER DEMOCRATIC WAY AGAINST THE POLITICAL POSITION OF WOMEN 
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN OBTAIN JUSTICE 
WE SHALL BE HEARD OF AGAIN GENTLEMEN AND OFTEN 
WHEN WE HAVE THE VOTE WE SHALL NOT COME HERE 
SO LONG AS MEN LIKE SIR EDWARD GREY AND HIS LIBERAL PARTY WILL NOT ALLOW US 
PLEASE CONFINE YOURSELF TO THE CHARGES WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH MISS PANKHURST 
POLITICAL SPEECHES ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THIS COURT 
AND VERY PROPERLY TOO 
VERY WELL 
I HAVE NO COMPLAINT TO MAKE AGAINST THE POLICE 
THE ASSAULT WAS INTENDED FOR UNRULY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 
WHO WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN MY POINT OF VIEW 
I STAND BY MY EVERY ACTION AND SHALL DO THE SAME AGAIN 
THANK YOU MISS PANKHURST 
CHRISTABEL WAS ABSOLUTELY SPLENDID 
SHE IS NEVER ANYTHING LESS 
I SUPPOSE NOT 
I WONDER WHETHER ANNIE 
ANNIE WILL ALSO BE ABSOLUTELY SPLENDID 
I AM A MILL WORKER A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LOCAL CARD ROOM HAND ASSOCIATION 
I AM CURRENTLY ASSISTING IN THE ORGANISATION OF WORKING WOMEN FOR THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY 
I WENT TO THAT MEETING ON BEHALF OF THOSE WOMEN TO ASK A CERTAIN QUESTION OF SIR EDWARD GREY 
WE'RE NOT CONCERNED WITH SIR EDWARD GREY 
I AM VERY CONCERNED WITH SIR EDWARD GREY 
IF IT WERE NOT FOR SIR EDWARD GREY I WOULD NOT BE STANDING HERE NOW 
PLEASE LIMIT YOUR REMARKS TO THE CHARGES 
WHAT AM I CHARGED WITH I HAVE FORGOTTEN OBSTRUCTING THE POLICE 
I MIGHT HAVE OBSTRUCTED SOME PEOPLE AND THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN POLICEMEN 
ON THE OTHER HAND I WAS OBSTRUCTED 
I WAS TREATED VERY ROUGHLY AND I WAS HUSTLED OUT OF THAT HALL 
BY WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POLICEMAN BUT I HAD NO WAY OF TELLING 
IN ANY CASE I HAVE NO REGRETS ABOUT ANYTHING I DID 
I WAS THERE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WORKING WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY QUITE RIGHT TOO 
YOU HAVE HAD YOUR SAY MISS PANKHURST AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH 
HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO ADD MISS KENNEY 
I WOULD DO IT ALL AGAIN IF NECESSARY 
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS MR. BELL 
NO SIR YOU MAY STAND DOWN MISS KENNEY 
WELL DONE THANK YOU I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO TO US 
DEPORTATION I SHOULD THINK 
THEY ARE GOING AWAY TO DECIDE 
WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE READY FOR THEM 
MISS PANKHURST CARRICK EVENING CHRONICLE MAY I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU 
SO LONG AS YOU WRITE DOWN EXACTLY WHAT I SAY 
AND THAT WE THINK IT IS ALL SIR EDWARD GREY'S FAULT 
RIGHT 
MISS PANKHURST WILL BE FINED TEN SHILLINGS FOR ASSAULTING THE POLICE 
WITH THE ALTERNATIVE OF SEVEN DAYS' IMPRISONMENT 
MISS PANKHURST AND MISS KENNEY WILL BE FINED FIVE SHILLINGS EACH FOR OBSTRUCTING THE POLICE 
WITH THE ALTERNATIVE OF THREE DAYS' IMPRISONMENT 
IN THE CASE OF MISS PANKHURST THE SENTENCES WILL BE CONCURRENT 
I SHALL PAY NO FINE 
HAVE YOU ANY GOODS TO DISTRAIN UPON 
NO I THINK NOT MISS KENNEY 
I REFUSE TO PAY THE FINE AND I HAVE NO GOODS 
YOU BOTH KNOW THE ALTERNATIVE 
ANNIE HELLO JESSIE LOVE IT IS GOOD OF YOU TO CALL 
WE DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT UNTIL WE READ IT IN THE PAPER 
IT IS ALL RIGHT IT IS PAINLESS AND THEY CAN'T EAT YOU 
WE WERE WORRIED ANNIE NO NEED I AM A REGULAR OLD LAG 
WAS THERE A LOT IN THE PAPERS PAGES AND PAGES GOOD 
ANNIE LOVE I BROUGHT SOME MONEY TO PAY THE FINE 
I DO NOT WANT YOU TO PAY THE FINE I THOUGHT I HAD BETTER ASK YOU FIRST 
GOOD GIRL YOU GIVE THAT MONEY TO THE WSPU THEY NEED IT 
IT SAID IN THE PAPER THAT WINSTON CHURCHILL WANTED TO PAY THE FINE 
SAVE THE HONOUR OF THE LIBERAL PARTY AND HIS NEXT SEAT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION 
IF WE HAD GONE AWAY QUIETLY AND PAID THE FINE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING IN THE PAPERS 
PERHAPS A FEW PARAGRAPHS THIS WAY THE PRISON WAY AYE 
WHAT IS IT REALLY LIKE 
IT IS STRANGE REALLY 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ONLY IN HERE FOR THREE DAYS THAT IS WHAT THEY TELL YOU YOU FRET 
YOU WONDER IF THEY WILL FORGET WHAT THEY SAID 
THAT IS THE WORST PART JESS YOU FEEL FORGOTTEN 
YOU WONDER IF THEY WILL REMEMBER AT THE END OF THREE DAYS TO LET YOU OUT 
WHEN YOU SEE THOSE OTHER WOMEN 
YOU KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE 
THEY MAKE YOU GO TO CHAPEL TELL YOU HOW WICKED YOU ARE 
THERE IS HELLFIRE AND DAMNATION WAITING FOR YOU IF YOU DO NOT REPENT 
BUT WE'RE ALL WOMEN REALLY 
SAD AND LOST MOST OF THEM 
WHEN THEY LOCK YOU UP IN YOUR CELL THAT IS WHEN YOU FEEL FORGOTTEN 
BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN WITH THE OTHERS YOUR SISTERS IT IS MUCH EASIER 
IF I HAD ANY DOUBT ABOUTS THE MOVEMENT I HAVE NOT NOW 
HOW ABOUT YOU 
ME YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY LOVE THOSE WHO ARE NOT WITH US 
I KNOW THE REST 
I AM NOT FRIGHTENED OF GOING TO PRISON IF YOU'RE NOT 
YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE MY PET 
NOT PET SISTER 
HELLO MOTHER 
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY 
A LONDON DAY 
YOU'RE VERY LATE THE MEETING WAS THIS AFTERNOON 
THE MEETING AS BAD AS THAT 
IT HAS BECOME AN ANNUAL RITUAL ONCE A YEAR THE SUFFRAGE SOCIETIES 
AND ORGANISATIONS CONVERGE UPON LONDON IN THEIR COATS OF MANY COLOURS 
AND THEY COORDINATE POLICY AND THEY GO AWAY AGAIN AND THE YEARS GO BY AND NOTHING HAPPENS 
YOU WERE OPTIMISTIC THIS MORNING 
YES MORNING IS THE TIME FOR OPTIMISM 
YES I WAS OPTIMISTIC 
THIS YEAR I THOUGHT I HOPED 
THERE HAS BEEN NEW SPIRIT IN THE YEAR WE SEEMED TO BE GAINING MOMENTUM 
STIFFEN THE SINEWS SUMMON UP THE BLOOD 
OH WE SAT AROUND THAT TABLE AND TOLD EACH OTHER WHAT WE'D BEEN DOING 
AND WE PASSED RESOLUTIONS CONGRATULATING EACH OTHER 
AND SEVERAL PEOPLE MADE SPEECHES SAYING NOW IS THE TIME FOR PATIENCE 
THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES WITH THE OTHER SIDE 
THE TIDE OF HISTORY IS WITH US 
AND I REALISED JUST HOW WRONG THEY ALL WERE 
WELL I HOPE YOU TOLD THEM SO 
I DID I TOLD THEM YOU WILL WAIT FOREVER IF YOU'RE RELYING 
ON PATIENCE AND POLITE LETTERS AND CAREFULLY WORDED PETITIONS 
YOU'LL WAIT FOREVER IF YOU RELY ON THE GOODWILL AND UNDERSTANDING OF POLITICAL LEADERS 
I TOLD THEM I WILL NOT WAIT FOR EVER I WANT ACTION NOW 
AND THEN I WALKED OUT 
I HOPE YOU'RE STILL ON SPEAKING TERMS 
OH I WAS VERY CIVIL EXTREMELY POLITE 
WHERE DID YOU GO I WENT TO SEE KEIR HARDIE 
WE WORKED CAREFULLY THROUGH A LIST OF THE FOURTEEN HONOURABLE GENTLEMEN 
WHO WANT TO BRING PRIVATE MEMBER'S BILLS THIS SESSION 
WHICH ONE WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO GIVING UP HIS BILL IN FAVOUR OF THE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE BILL ANY SUCCESS 
I THINK SO BAMFORD SLACK 
HE'S A SUPPORTER 
AND HE MIGHT WELCOME A CHANCE TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY 
WE'VE HAD PRIVATE MEMBER'S BILLS BEFORE ALL THROWN OUT 
I KNOW AND THEY WERE ALL BASED ON THE BILL YOUR FATHER DRAFTED OH MY DEAR GOD WHEN WAS IT 
TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR FATHER WOULD WANT US TO DO 
WOULD HE EXPECT US TO WAIT PATIENTLY WOULD HE WANT US TO DEMAND ACTION 
NO QUESTION WE DEMAND 
PERHAPS WE SHOULD DEMAND MORE THAN A PRIVATE MEMBER'S BILL 
DO I PREACH 
YES DO YOU MIND WOULD IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IF I DID NO I SUPPOSE NOT 
WE SHOULD MAKE ENOUGH NOISE TO PERSUADE THE LIBERALS 
TO PUT WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE INTO THEIR ELECTION PROGRAMME 
KEIR HARDIE'S GOING TO TALK TO ASQUITH ABOUT IT 
POOR MAN 
WHICH ONE 
NOT SURE 
BUT I HAVE THE GREATEST SYMPATHY WITH THE WOMEN'S CAUSE YOU KNOW THAT 
LIBERAL SYMPATHY LIKE YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE UNEMPLOYED FOR THE SICK FOR THE HUNGRY AND THE DISPOSSESSED 
I'VE HEARD THIS SPEECH MUST I LISTEN TO IT HERE IT'S THE SYMPATHY OF THE HANGMAN FOR HIS VICTIM 
I HAVE THE GREATEST SYMPATHY HE SAYS PULLING THE LEVER 
I'M CONCERNED WITH REASON NOT EMOTIONALISM 
THERE IS A GREAT AND MIGHTY CHASM THAT LIES BETWEEN SYMPATHY AND ACTION 
HOW CAN THE LIBERALS BE PERSUADED TO LEAP ACROSS IT 
NOT BY STRIDENT FEMALE AGITATION 
WE FIND THAT VERY IRRITATING MY HEART BLEEDS FOR YOU 
IN ANY CASE YOU KNOW THE ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS 
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT TO ME 
I HAVEN'T HAD YOUR EDUCATIONAL PRIVILEGES 
IT'S TRUE WE ARE DRAWING UP OUR ELECTION PROGRAMME 
WE MAKE OUR LIST ON MANY OF THE PEOPLE YOU MENTIONED 
THE SICK THE UNEMPLOYED THE HUNGRY AND THE DISPOSSESSED I'M SURE THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE ON YOUR LIST 
I'M SURE THEY WILL BE WE ASSESS THE PRIORITIES THE CLAIMS ON OUR ATTENTION 
AND ARRANGE THEM IN THE ORDER THAT WILL WIN YOU VOTES 
WE NEED VOTES CAN YOU MANAGE WITHOUT VOTES 
TELL ME WHERE DOES WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE COME ON YOUR LIST OF PRIORITIES 
NOWHERE IT DOESN'T QUITE FIT ON THE LIST 
BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T WIN YOU VOTES 
BECAUSE IT IS AND WAS AN ISSUE THAT IS THE CONCERN OF A TINY ALBEIT NOISY MINORITY 
I DON'T BELIEVE THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION WANTS WOMEN TO HAVE THE VOTE 
I BELIEVE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN CARE ENOUGH TO DEBATE THE ISSUE 
YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH THAT THE PARLIAMENTARY TRADITION 
IS THAT ANY LEGISLATION SHOULD REFLECT A CONSENSUS VIEW AMONG THE PEOPLE 
AND YOU REFUSE TO BE DIVERTED FROM YOUR DUTY BY AGITATORS AND EXTREMISTS WHY SHOULD WE BE 
I'M SURE WE WILL MAKE PARLIAMENTARY TIME AVAILABLE 
FOR ANY MEMBER WHO CARES TO INTRODUCE A PRIVATE MEMBER'S BILL 
WHICH THE BACKWOODSMEN WILL THROW OUT THE SAME WAY THEY THROW OUT EVERY OTHER BILL 
THERE HAVE TO BE SAFEGUARDS IN PROCEDURE TO PREVENT RECKLESS LEGISLATION PRECISELY 
LIKE GIVING PEOPLE THE SIMPLE DEMOCRATIC RIGHT TO CAST A VOTE FOR THE CANDIDATE OF THEIR CHOICE 
HARDIE I ASSURE YOU MY SYMPATHY IS GENUINE 
BUT YOU MUST KNOW THAT POLITICS IS LARGELY A QUESTION OF TIMING 
THE TIME IS NOT YET RIGHT 
THE FEELING AMONG THE PEOPLE 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT PEOPLE 
WHEN DO YOU EVER MEET ANY PEOPLE 
LIKE THE PEOPLE OF THE CLYDE OR THE PEOPLE OF THE WELSH VALLEYS TELL ME 
DO THE WELSH MINERS SUPPORT YOU AND MRS. PANKHURST 
THEY WOULD LIKE A VOICE IN THE WAY THEIR COUNTRY IS RUN BUT THAT'S THE REAL OBJECTION ISN'T IT 
IF YOU EXTEND THE FRANCHISE EVEN A MODEST AMOUNT LET'S SAY TO WOMEN 
HOUSEHOLDERS OVER THE AGE OF THIRTY DOCTOR PANKHURST'S RECOMMENDATION 
THEN SEVERAL MILLION MEN WILL ALSO DEMAND THE VOTE PERHAPS EVERY MAN OVER TWENTY ONE IRRESPECTIVE OF PROPERTY 
THE VOTE IS A PRIVILEGE IT MUST BE EARNED 
NOT A PRIVILEGE A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT 
YOU SEE WE DISAGREE 
A GREAT AND MIGHTY CHASM 
HOW DO WE CROSS IT 
IN THE PROPER DEMOCRATIC WAY YOU HAVE A CASE 
YOU MUST PROVE THAT CASE BY REASONED ARGUMENT AND PEACEFUL PERSUASION BUT NOT BY MILITANT AGITATION 
GENTLE PERSUASION ALLIED TO PATIENCE 
YOU RECOMMEND PATIENCE 
THE GREAT BRITISH VIRTUE 
IT ASTONISHES ME THAT YOU PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE THAT 
ANNIE ANNIE 
ANNIE ANNIE OVER HERE ANNIE 
OH ANNIE 
DON'T MIND IF I EAT WHILE WE TALK DO YOU NOT AT ALL 
ONLY SAID IT FOR POLITENESS' SAKE 
I'M SO HUNGRY I'D EAT EVEN IF YOU DID OBJECT 
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE A CUP OF TEA 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SAY 
WELL IF YOU COULD JUST TELL US ABOUT YOUR PRISON EXPERIENCES MISS KENNEY 
WELL WE WERE VERY WELL TREATED I'D LIKE YOU TO SAY THAT 
NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TREATMENT 
WE DID HAVE TO WEAR PRISON CLOTHING 
THEY GAVE US NICE WARM UNDERWEAR OR SHOULDN'T I SAY THAT 
SAY WHATEVER YOU LIKE THEY GAVE ME A LOVELY PAIR OF BOOTS ONE WAS TOO BIG AND THE OTHER TOO SMALL 
EVERYBODY HAD TO TAKE A BATH BUT MISS PANKHURST AND MYSELF THEY THOUGHT WE WERE CLEAN ENOUGH 
WHAT ABOUT THE FOOD THE FOOD WAS LOVELY IF YOU LIKE BROWN BREAD AND PORRIDGE 
THREE TIMES ON SUNDAY WE HAD BROWN BREAD AND PORRIDGE AM I GOING TOO FAST FOR YOU 
NO YOU'RE DOING FINE 
AND ON SUNDAY WE HAD TO GO TO CHAPEL WHERE THEY TELL YOU YOU MUSTN'T STEAL YOU MUSTN'T LIE 
YOU MUSTN'T DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS YOU DON'T DO IT'S FUNNY EXCEPT YOU MUSTN'T LAUGH BUT NO COMPLAINTS 
DON'T FORGET TO PUT THAT 
I WON'T FORGET 
WELL ER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME MISS KENNEY 
YOU HAVEN'T ASKED ME IF I'M WILLING TO GO BACK TO PRISON 
I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT 
GOOD 
I'M GLAD GOOD MORNING MISS KENNEY GOOD MORNING ENJOY YOUR BREAKFAST THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I'LL SHOW YOU OUT 
THANK YOU FOR COMING AND SO EARLY 
YOU'VE NO IDEA OF THE FUSS YOU'VE CAUSED 
GOOD FUSS OR A BAD FUSS 
VERY GOOD LOTS OF LETTERS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
GOOD PROTEST MEETINGS 
THERE'S ONE AT THE FREE TRADE HALL ON SATURDAY 
KEIR HARDIE'S GOING TO SPEAK 
THE BRAVE LITTLE MILL GIRL HAS WON THE HEARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
I BEG YOUR PARDON THAT'S WHAT ONE OF THE PAPERS SAID 
ONE THAT'S ON OUR SIDE OF COURSE 
ISN'T IT EASY TO GET INTO THE NEWSPAPERS 
I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO BE A MILL GIRL TESS 
IT'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF 
NOBODY WANTS TO BE A MILL GIRL 
YOU GET PUSHED INTO IT YOU'VE GOT NO CHOICE 
ISN'T THAT WHAT THE BATTLE'S ALL ABOUT 
WOMEN HAVING THE CHOICE 
COURSE YOU'RE RIGHT WHERE WOULD I BE IF THERE WEREN'T PEOPLE AROUND ME 
TELLING ME WHAT TO THINK ALL THE TIME GOT ANY MORE BACON 
WE HAVE A LIBERAL GOVERNMENT WITH A MASSIVE MAJORITY 
AND LABOUR JUST WON TWENTY NINE SEATS THAT HELPS US DOESN'T IT 
AND KEIR HARDIE'S INTRODUCING A PRIVATE MEMBER'S BILL 
HE'LL STILL NEED GOVERNMENT SUPPORT BEHIND THE SCENES 
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO CARRY ON MAKING A NUISANCE OF OURSELVES 
IS THAT ENOUGH 
DID YOU ENJOY YOUR TRIP TO LONDON 
I KEPT GETTING ON THE WRONG BUS BUT YES I DID LIKE IT MADE 'EM ALL LAUGH AT THE ALBERT HALL 
YOU MADE THEM LAUGH IT WAS THE USUAL THING 
TESS AND I TRIED TO ASK OUR QUESTION AND THEY WOULDN'T ANSWER 
SO WE GOT UP AND UNFURLED OUR BANNERS THEN THEY ALL LAUGHED WHY 
GUESS WHOSE BANNER WAS UPSIDE DOWN 
NOW WHAT ARE YOU WRITING 
WE MUST ATTACK THE PROBLEM AT ITS HEART 
IT'S NECESSARY FOR US TO FORM A LONDON COMMITTEE 
OF THE WOMEN'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL UNION A PERMANENT LONDON ORGANISATION 
YES YOU COULD GO TO LONDON WHEN YOU FINISH YOUR LAW STUDIES 
YOU COULD GO NOW ME 
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD ROUSE LONDON TO MILITANT ACTION 
DON'T SEE WHY NOT 
I'D NEED SOME MONEY 
HOW MUCH HOW MUCH TO ROUSE LONDON 
TWO SHOULD BE ENOUGH

WELL DONE FLORA THEY SAY

BY THE WAY ANNIE I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AND I'M ON YOUR SIDE

SHE SEEMS NICE SHE IS 
WELL SIT DOWN MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME I HAD A LONG SIT ON THE TRAIN 
I'LL WANDER ABOUT A BIT IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL 
THEY SHOULD BE BETTER NO THEY'RE LOVELY 
THANK YOU 
I DON'T WORK HARD ENOUGH 
YOU NEVER STOP WORKING SO YOUR MOTHER SAYS 
I DON'T WORK HARD ENOUGH AT PAINTING 
ALWAYS IN TROUBLE AT COLLEGE 
GIVE UP YOUR POLITICAL WORK CONCENTRATE ON YOUR STUDIES I TAKE NO NOTICE 
SAME FOR CHRISTABEL ESPECIALLY SINCE SHE'S BEEN TO PRISON 
COLLEGE AUTHORITIES DIDN'T LIKE THAT 
LAW STUDENTS SHOULDN'T GO TO PRISON THEY'VE BANNED HER FROM POLITICAL ACTIVITIES 
I SUPPOSE IT IS A BIT OF A CONTRADICTION IN THEIR EYES 
SHE'S A MARVELLOUS GIRL CHRISTABEL 
SO EVERYBODY TELLS ME 
THEY SAY YOU'RE MARVELLOUS TOO 
AND YOU'VE ACQUIRED A REPUTATION FOR QUICK THINKING I CAN SEE WHY 
I'LL HAVE TO IMPROVE ON MY THINKING 
OH WHY THE LAST TIME I CAME TO LONDON FOR THE ALBERT HALL MEETING I KEPT GETTING ON THE WRONG BUS 
SAW A LOT OF SIGHTS I DIDN'T MEAN TO 
TELL ME WHERE YOU WANT TO GO AND I'LL GIVE YOU VERY CAREFUL INSTRUCTIONS 
YES AND A SIGN ROUND MY NECK SAYING IF LOST PLEASE RETURN TO FORTY FIVE PARK WALK CHELSEA 
IF YOU'D LIKE 
I'M GOING TO SEE KEIR HARDIE IN THE MORNING 
THAT'S EASY THERE'S A WELL WORN PATH BETWEEN HERE AND KEIR HARDIE'S 
I THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE 
WHEN YOU'VE HAD A DAY TO SETTLE IN I'LL SHOW YOU SOME OF THE SIGHTS 
I'D LOVE TO SEE THE NATIONAL GALLERY I DON'T MEAN THOSE SIGHTS 
I MEAN THE SORT OF SIGHTS THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IN POLITE CIRCLES 
THE EAST END 
HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE FACES IN THE EAST END THAT'S THE REAL NATIONAL GALLERY 
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE SYLVIA ANNIE 
I KNOW YOU WORSHIP THE GROUND THAT CHRISTABEL PANKHURST WALKS ON AND NO DOUBT FOR GOOD REASON 
BUT SYLVIA'S SOWN THE SEEDS WHERE THEY'LL BRING FORTH THE FRUIT THAT YOUR MOVEMENT NEEDS 
YOU MEAN IN THE EAST END AMONG THE WORKING CLASSES CORRECT 
I'M NOT DENYING THE VALUE OF HAVING THE MIDDLE CLASSES ON YOUR SIDE 
OR EVEN THE OCCASIONAL ARISTOCRAT WITH A GUILTY CONSCIENCE AND A FEW SHILLINGS TO SPEND 
BUT IT'S THE AGE OF THE WORKING CLASS AND IT'S THEIR SUPPORT THAT WILL WIN THE DAY FOR YOU IN THE END 
I AGREE WITH YOU THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT MY CLOGS AND SHAWL 
DID YOU 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE RESOLVED NEVER TO WEAR THEM AGAIN 
I WAS 
BUT WE THOUGHT IF WE LOBBY PARLIAMENT AND MARCH ON DOWNING STREET 
THE CLOGS AND SHAWL WOULD LOOK MORE INTERESTING IN PHOTOGRAPHS IN NEWSPAPERS 
THAT'S WHAT WE THINK 
THAT'S WHAT CHRISTABEL THINKS 
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CHRISTABEL 
DON'T HAVE MANY IDEAS OF ME OWN 
ANNIE JUST A WEE WARNING ESPECIALLY NOW YOU'RE IN LONDON 
DON'T LET ANYBODY PATRONISE YOU 
WHO WOULD DO THAT ANYBODY 
BELIEVE ME ANNIE I KNOW 
ANY SON OR DAUGHTER OF THE WORKING CLASS WHO SHOWS THE BRAINS 
AND INTELLIGENCE TO MOVE AMONG THE LORDS AND MASTERS LIKE YOU LIKE ME 
GIVE THE LORDS AND MASTERS HALF A CHANCE THEY'LL TURN YOU INTO A PERFORMING MONKEY 
I'VE SEEN IT IN MY OWN PARTY 
THE NEW LABOUR MEMBERS THEY ENJOY THE PATRONAGE THE DINING AND WINING 
AND IT DESTROYS THEM IN THE END THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S HAPPENING 
DON'T LET OTHER PEOPLE PULL THE STRINGS ANNIE 
KEEP A TIGHT HOLD ON THE STRINGS 
THAT WAY YOU'LL KEEP A TIGHT HOLD ON YOUR OWN SOUL 
I'LL DO MY BEST 
OH I'LL BACK YOU TO SURVIVE 
HERE NOW IT'S TIME I DID SOME WORK THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR 
OF A MR. AND MRS. PETHICK LAWRENCE I'VE HEARD A BIT ABOUT THEM 
WELL FREDERICK'S THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE CAMBRIDGE UNION BUT YOU MUSTN'T HOLD THAT AGAINST HIM 
HE MARRIED A GOOD WOMAN AND SAW THE LIGHT 
HE PUBLISHES THE LABOUR RECORD AND THE PAIR OF THEM RUN OUR MISSION FOR WORKING CLASS GIRLS 
THEY'RE GOOD ORGANISERS AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING YOU'LL NEED 
ORGANISATION TO GO WITH YOUR WORKING CLASS SUPPORT AND YOU'LL GET THAT 
FROM FREDERICK AND EMMELINE IF YOU CAN PERSUADE THEM TO CO OPERATE 
I'LL PERSUADE 'EM I GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING MRS. PANKHURST TRIED TO GET THEM INVOLVED AND THEY REFUSED 
SAID THEY WERE ALREADY TOO BUSY TOO MANY COMMITMENTS WHICH HAPPENS TO BE TRUE 
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO DO A FAIR BIT OF WORK 
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT 
WELL IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT ME TO DO THERE'S JUST ONE THING 
OH I KNOW I KNOW I'LL TELL YOU WHICH BUS TO CATCH 
SEE ON THAT ROAD THERE GET ON THE FIRST BUS THAT COMES ANY BUS 
MENTION MY NAME TO THE DRIVER TELL THEM WHERE YOU WANT TO GO AND YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT YOU'LL HAVE NO TROUBLE 
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT I DO I DO 
MISSISSIPPI KENNEY ANNIE KENNEY 
HAVE YOU YOUR CARD 
CARD THE PETHICK LAWRENCES ARE EXPECTING ME

I'LL SEE IF THEY'RE READY TO RECEIVE YOU 
ER MR. AND MRS. PETHICK LAWRENCE WILL SEE YOU NOW MISS KENNEY 
MISS ANNIE KENNEY HELLO MISS KENNEY HOW DO YOU DO MR. PETHICK LAWRENCE 
MY WIFE EMMELINE DELIGHTED TO MEET YOU MISS KENNEY 
I'M DELIGHTED TOO PLEASE DO SIT DOWN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THOSE ARE GREAT 
HAVE YOU FULLY RECOVERED FROM YOUR EXPERIENCES IN PRISON 
I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT IT HAPPENED SO LONG AGO GOOD 
NOW DON'T THINK ME RUDE MISS KENNEY 
BUT BEFORE YOU TELL US WHY YOU'VE COME WE'RE BOTH WELL ENOUGH INFORMED TO GUESS WHY YOU'VE COME 
I MUST ASK YOU TO BE REASONABLY BRIEF WE BOTH HAVE OTHER MEETINGS TO ATTEND 
WELL WE WANT YOU TO JOIN OUR MOVEMENT 
IT'S THE WOMEN'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL UNION 
MRS. PANKHURST ASKED US BEFORE 
AND WE DECLINED I KNOW THAT YES 
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WE'LL CHANGE OUR MINDS 
PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MINDS ALL THE TIME DON'T THEY AT LEAST I DO 
A YEAR AGO I WASN'T INTERESTED IN ANY OF THIS BUT I CHANGED MY MIND 
I CHANGED IT ENOUGH TO GO TO PRISON 
YES WELL THERE ARE A GREAT MANY GOOD CAUSES IN THE WORLD ALL GOOD ENOUGH TO GO TO PRISON FOR 
THERE JUST ISN'T TIME TO SUPPORT THEM ALL THAT'S WHAT WE TOLD MRS. PANKHURST 
BUT YOU AGREE IT'S A GOOD CAUSE OF COURSE THERE'S NO DISPUTE ABOUT THAT YOU'RE SYMPATHISERS 
WE BOTH ARE WE'VE GOT MORE SYMPATHY THAN WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH 
WE CAN PAPER THE WALLS WITH SYMPATHY 
THE PRIME MINISTER SAYS HE'S A SYMPATHISER BUT HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING 
I'M SORRY IF IT SOUNDS RUDE BUT I DIDN'T COME FOR YOUR SYMPATHY I CAME FOR YOUR SUPPORT 
YOU MUST REALISE THE EXTENT OF OUR PRESENT RESPONSIBILITIES 
I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY PEOPLE MR. KEIR HARDIE TOLD ME THAT 
WE RUN A CO OPERATIVE DRESSMAKING BUSINESS A HOLIDAY HOTEL FOR WORKING GIRLS 
THE ESPERANCE MR. KEIR HARDIE TOLD ME THAT TOO 
NOW THERE'S A BUSY MAN BUT HE'S A SUPPORTER 
WE RUN A WEST LONDON MISSION AND I PUBLISH A NEWSPAPER 
MY MOTHER SAID IF YOU WANT SOMETHING DOING GO TO A BUSY PERSON 
BUT THERE ARE LIMITS MISS KENNEY HOWEVER NOBLE YOUR INTENTIONS 
I'M SORRY I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY LIMITS 
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND RUDE BUT 
GO ON THOSE WHO AREN'T WITH US MUST BE AGAINST US 
TOLD YOU IT WAS RUDE 
PERHAPS I COULD DO SOMETHING FOR YOU IN RETURN WHAT 
I COULD TALK TO THE GIRLS IN THE HOSTEL I COULD TELL THEM ABOUT THE MOVEMENT 
OR I COULD TELL THEM ABOUT PRISON MY ADVENTURES IN STRANGEWAYS 
I COULD GO ON FOR ABOUT AN HOUR WITHOUT REPEATING MYSELF AND IT USUALLY GOES DOWN VERY WELL 
ASK ME WHAT SORT OF SUPPORT WE NEED 
I'LL BE BRIEF AND YOU WON'T MISS YOUR OTHER MEETINGS WHAT SORT OF SUPPORT DO YOU NEED 
WELL MR. KEIR HARDIE SAID YOU'D BE THE IDEAL PERSON TO BE 
THE FIRST NATIONAL TREASURER OF THE WOMEN'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL UNION 
THE NATIONAL TREASURER 
THE FIRST HE SAID YOU WERE VERY EFFICIENT AND BUSINESS LIKE 
WE'RE NOT EITHER WE CAN'T GET OUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND WE END UP IN PRISON HAVE YOU ANY FUNDS 
NOT REALLY THEY GAVE ME TWO TO COME TO LONDON WITH BUT THAT'S ALL GONE I THINK WE MIGHT BE IN DEBT 
HONORARY TREASURER WITH THE EMPHASIS ON HONORARY 
THE IDEA WAS THAT THE TREASURER WOULD RAISE FUNDS FOR THE CAMPAIGN 
YOU SEE IT'S ALL BEEN MRS. PANKHURST'S MONEY SO FAR 
SHE'S NOT A RICH WOMAN SHE'S AS POOR AS I AM BUT SHE WON'T ADMIT IT 
MR. HARDIE SAID YOU WERE VERY GOOD AT RAISING MONEY 
WHAT A TALKATIVE MAN HE IS 
PERHAPS SYLVIA COULD DONATE A PAINTING 
PAINTING 
IF YOU DECIDE TO HOLD A RAFFLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SHE COULD 
I KNOW I'M TALKING TOO MUCH AND THESE ARE DETAILS OF POLICY 
I HOPE YOU DON'T WANT AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER I WOULDN'T WANT TO RUSH YOU 
I'M SURE MR. KEIR HARDIE MUST HAVE SAID GIVE THEM TIME LET THE IDEA SIMMER 
HE DID SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
HE'S A MARVELLOUS MAN MR. HARDIE AND SO ELOQUENT VERY 
HOW MUCH TIME WILL YOU GIVE ME TO SIMMER 
THERE'S A MEETING TOMORROW NIGHT AT SYLVIA'S FORTY FIVE PARK WALK CHELSEA 
THAT'S WHERE I'M STAYING 
IF YOU JUST COME ALONG MEET SYLVIA AND THE OTHERS 
HEAR ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN PLEASE SAY YOU'LL COME 
WELL NO PROMISES 
I DIDN'T COME FOR PROMISES 
JUST SAY YOU'LL COME TO THE MEETING 
ALL RIGHT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MRS. PETHICK LAWRENCE THANK YOU BOTH 
I KNEW YOU'D HELP TOMORROW NIGHT WE CAN TALK ABOUT ME COMING TO THE HOSTEL 
AND TELLING THE GIRLS ABOUT PRISON WELL PERHAPS ONE THING AT A TIME 
I PREFER THREE OR FOUR BUT I'M NOT SENSIBLE 
I'LL BE QUIET AND LET YOU GET ON WITH YOUR BUSINESS 
SYLVIA'S TAKING ME TO THE EAST END THERE'S SO MUCH OF LONDON TO SEE ISN'T THERE THERE'S QUITE A LOT 
IT'S VERY EXCITING 
THE RESOLUTION IS THAT THE CENTRAL LONDON COMMITTEE OF THE WOMEN'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL UNION BE FORMED 
UNANIMOUS 
NEXT THE POST OF HONORARY SECRETARY 
I PROPOSE SYLVIA PANKHURST SECONDED 
ARE THERE ANY OTHER NOMINATIONS 
I THINK YOU'D BETTER WRITE UNANIMOUSLY 
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH I'LL DO MY BEST 
NEXT THE POSITION OF NATIONAL TREASURER 
I PROPOSE MRS. PETHICK LAWRENCE SECONDED 
PERHAPS MRS. PETHICK LAWRENCE ISN'T PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE NOMINATION 
IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS WE CAN ANSWER WHICH WILL HELP MAKE UP YOUR MIND 
WELL I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T ANY MONEY 
CORRECT 
HAVE YOU ANY PLACE IN MIND AS AN OFFICE A HEADQUARTERS 
WELL WE THOUGHT HERE YOU'RE MOST WELCOME 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR STUDIES SHE'LL DO THAT THROUGH THE NIGHT SAME AS SHE DOES AT THE MOMENT 
WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE LONDON ORGANISATION 
WE ARE THE LONDON ORGANISATION 
I SEE 
WELL HAVE YOU ANY ASSETS 
STAMPS STATIONERY 
A TYPEWRITER FLORA DRUMMOND SHE WORKS FOR THE OLIVER COMPANY IN MANCHESTER 
SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET US A TYPEWRITER 
BUT I THINK YOU'LL BE STARTING WITH A TOTALLY CLEAN SHEET MRS. PETHICK LAWRENCE 
I ACCEPT THE NOMINATION 
I THINK IT WILL BE CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED 
HOW WAS IT 
YOU ARE MARRIED TO THE FIRST NATIONAL TREASURER OF THE WOMEN'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL UNION 
YES I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE 
UNANIMOUS DECISION 
VERY LITTLE OPPOSITION 
GOOD 
HOW DO YOU FIND THEM AS AN ORGANISATION 
THERE ISN'T REALLY ANY ORGANISATION 
THEY ARE RECKLESS INNOCENT CHILDLIKE ALMOST 
ARE THEY RIGHT THEIR INTENTIONS I MEAN 
TOTALLY 
A JUST AND NOBLE CAUSE 
ALL THE REST IS PRACTICAL 
WELL WE CAN SOLVE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS 
WHAT ARE YOU WRITING 
JUST MAKING A LIST OF NAMES 
NAMES WHAT SORT OF NAMES 
PEOPLE WHO MIGHT GIVE OR LOAN MONEY TO YOUR CAUSE 
YOUR NAME'S AT THE TOP OF THE LIST 
ALWAYS IS 
I DID ENJOY THIS EVENING THE MEETING 
YEAH I REALLY THINK WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE 
YOU KNOW IF I'D HAVE THOUGHT A YEAR AGO 
I'D BE IN LONDON AND MEETING PEOPLE LIKE THE PETHICK LAWRENCES 
PETHICK LAWRENCES THEY ARE SPECIAL AREN'T THEY 
THEY'VE GOT MONEY AND A SOCIAL CONSCIENCE 
IT'S AN UNUSUAL COMBINATION IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THEY'VE GOT MONEY NO IT'S OURS 
YOUR FAULT AND MY FAULT WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
ANNIE YOU ARE HAPPIER THAN YOU WERE A YEAR AGO 
YOU FIND FULFILMENT IN THE WORK YEAH 
BUT YOU MUSTN'T MAKE THE MISTAKE IN THINKING THAT IT'S FOR YOUR BENEFIT 
YOU'RE NOT IMPORTANT 
I'M NOT IMPORTANT 
IT'S THE MISTAKE CHRISTABEL MAKES CHRISTABEL 
THE LOVELY LADY CHRISTABEL 
SHE'S FIGHTING FOR THE EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN 
BUT THE PERSON SHE'S REALLY EMANCIPATING IS HERSELF 
WATCH HER WHEN SHE'S MAKING A SPEECH 
OR WATCH IT WHEN SHE COMES OUT OF PRISON 
YOU'RE WATCHING AN EMANCIPATED WOMAN 
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM 
COME ON TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN 
WELL 
WHEN YOU WERE RELEASED FROM PRISON THERE WAS A RECEPTION COMMITTEE SMILES FLOWERS 
A CAB TO TAKE YOU TO A HEARTY BREAKFAST AND AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESS 
BUT THINK ABOUT THE OTHER WOMEN THE ONES WHO CREEP AWAY SILENTLY 
NO FLOWERS NO CABS PROBABLY NO BREAKFAST EITHER 
THEY'RE THE ONES ANNIE THE BATTLE IS FOR THEM NOT FOR US WE DON'T MATTER 
YOU MEAN LIKE THE WOMEN ON THE EMBANKMENT 
YES 
FOR CHRISTABEL THE MOVEMENT IS HER LIFE 
AND FOR YOUR MOTHER YES FOR HER TOO 
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH 
FOR ME IT HAS TO BE A SACRIFICE OF MY LIFE 
YOU'RE NOT LIKE YOUR MOTHER OR CHRISTABEL ARE YOU 
DIFFERENT BUT THE SAME 
DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THINGS BUT THE SAME PASSIONS 
WHEN I QUARREL WITH MY MOTHER 
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD US QUARREL HAVE YOU 
YOU CAN HEAR IT FOR MILES AROUND 
WE QUARREL BECAUSE WE SHARE THE SAME PASSIONS BECAUSE WE CARE 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE 
SIMPLE 
MY MOTHER AND CHRISTABEL TOO 
THEY DEVOTE THEIR LIFE TO THE MOVEMENT 
BUT THEY HAVEN'T HAD TO GIVE UP ANYTHING ELSE 
I HAVE 
IF I WAS SENT ON THIS EARTH TO DO ANYTHING IT WAS TO PAINT PICTURES 
I MAY NOT BE VERY GOOD AT IT YOU CAN'T TELL BUT IT'S A HARD JOB BEING A BAD ARTIST EVEN 
IT'S WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO ANNIE 
PAINT PICTURES 
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THE WOMEN ON THE EMBANKMENT 
PAINTING PICTURES SEEMS LIKE AN OBSCENITY 
JUST NOT IMPORTANT 
ONLY TO ME IT IS IMPORTANT 
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH 
HELLO LOVE 
COLD TONIGHT ISN'T IT

YOU WERE SENT TO LONDON TO ORGANISE POLITICAL ACTIVITY AND WHAT YOU DO 
WITHIN TWO WEEKS YOU BOOK THE BIGGEST HALL YOU CAN LAY YOUR HANDS ON 
YOU COMMIT US TO FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW WE HAVE NO MONEY 
AND I AM TOLD THAT I AM TO ADDRESS THIS 
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW LONG IT TAKES TO ORGANISE A SUCCESSFUL MEETING ON THIS SCALE 
IS IT TOO LATE TO CANCEL MUCH TOO LATE YES 
OUR FIRST LONDON MEETING 
IT NEEDED SIX WEEKS' PREPARATION AT LEAST 
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT OUR FRIENDS IN THE PRESS WILL BE SAYING IN A FEW DAYS 
LAST NIGHT MRS. PANKHURST ADDRESSED THE FIRST LONDON MEETING OF THE WOMEN'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL UNION 
SHE RECEIVED A LUKEWARM RECEPTION FROM AN AUDIENCE OF TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE MAINLY FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY 
YOU'RE BEING VERY UNFAIR EVERYBODY'S WORKED VERY HARD OF COURSE YOU HAVE WE ALL WORK HARD 
I'VE BEEN WORKING HARD FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS BUT I STILL WOULDN'T BE MAD ENOUGH TO THINK I COULD TAKE THE CAPITAL OF 
THE EMPIRE IN THREE WEEKS HOWEVER MANY PAVEMENTS I'D CHALKED ON 
I THINK YOU'RE WRONG MRS. PANKHURST I THINK THE HALL WILL BE FULL 
REALLY 
AND WHO WILL THIS AUDIENCE CONSIST OF 
ALL OUR SUPPORTERS FROM THE EAST END 
YOUR PEOPLE I DON'T OWN THEM 
AND YOU THINK THESE WOMEN WILL COME TO THE MEETING 
I BELIEVE THEY'LL COME WE'RE PAYING THEIR FARES AND WE'RE GONNA GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO EAT AND DRINK 
IF YOU'D SPENT MORE TIME OF YOUR PREPARATIONS 
WE COULD'VE GUARANTEED THAT HALL WOULD BE FILLED 
AND WITH PEOPLE OF INFLUENCE POWER 
NOT NECESSARILY PEOPLE YOU LIKE BUT PEOPLE WE NEED 
I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING IT FOR EVERYBODY 
ALL WOMEN GIVE THEM ALL SOME CHANCE SOME HOPE 
ANNIE 
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME 
I'M NOT QUESTIONING YOUR MOTIVES ANY OF YOU 
OR YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS 
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME SIDE 
IT'S PURELY A QUESTION OF TACTICS 
I'M DESPERATELY WORRIED 
IF THIS MEETING FAILS 
WE COULD BE PUBLICLY DISCREDITED BANKRUPT INTO THE BARGAIN 
EVEN HELD UP TO RIDICULE AND ALL THROUGH BEING IN TOO MUCH OF A HURRY 
BUT YOU KNOW THE RIGHT PEOPLE THE PEOPLE OF INFLUENCE COULDN'T YOU ASK THEM 
ANNIE I DON'T THINK THERE'S TIME 
ALL RIGHT 
I'LL TRY 
WELL WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO HAVEN'T WE YES WE HAVE 
LAURA TESS CAN YOU SPARE ME SOME SECRETARIAL ASSISTANCE 
CAN WE MOVE THIS DO YOU THINK I TALKED OUT OF TURN

I THINK THE BANNER'S BEAUTIFUL 
THANK YOU 
OH ANNIE I DO HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT 
ABOUT THE MEETING BEING A SUCCESS 
SYLVIA SO DO I 
I ORDERED TOO MUCH 
ALL WE CAN DO IS WAIT AND SEE 
SAY A QUICK PRAYER THAT MIGHT HELP DOES THAT LOOK ALL RIGHT 
LOOKS MARVELLOUS 
I HOPE SOMEBODY'S HERE TO SEE IT 
ARE WE READY TO OPEN THE DOORS YET 
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES 
IT'S VERY COLD OUT THERE IS THERE ANYONE TO OPEN THE DOORS TO 
I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T SEE BUT I CAN HEAR VOICES 
LET 'EM IN THEY MAY AS WELL WAIT IN THE WARM 
I'M WAITING TO HEAR MRS. PANKHURST APOLOGISE 
WHAT FOR THE WAY SHE BEHAVED 
ARE YOU STILL UPSET 
NO SENSE IN STAYING UPSET IS THERE 
BESIDES SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT EITHER WAY WE'VE GOT A MEETING MIGHT BE A GOOD ONE MIGHT BE A FLOP 
I'VE HAD BOTH IN MY TIME AND I'M STILL HERE 
YOU'D BETTER SAY ALL THAT IN YOUR SPEECH YOU'RE STILL HERE I PREFER CUTTING BREAD TO SPEECHES 
HERE YOU ARE YOU CAN DO BOTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
LADIES MADAM CHAIRMAN THIS IS THE FIRST MEETING 
TO BE HELD IN LONDON OF THE WOMEN'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL UNION 
LADIES MADAM CHAIRMAN THIS IS THE 
ANNIE YOU'VE WON 
SISTERS THIS IS THE FIRST PUBLIC MEETING 
TO BE HELD IN LONDON OF THE WOMEN'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL UNION 
NOW THAT MIGHT SOUND LIKE A LOT OF BIG WORDS TO MOST OF YOU 
AND SO THEY DID TO ME I PRACTISED THEM SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THE MEETING TO BE SURE OF GETTING THEM RIGHT 
I SHAN'T USE ANY MORE BIG WORDS 
I SHALL LEAVE THAT TO THOSE WHO ARE CLEVERER THAN I 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU WHAT THIS MOVEMENT MEANS TO ME 
IT ALL STARTED FUNNILY ENOUGH BECAUSE I USED TO SING IN A CHOIR 
IT WAS THROUGH THE CHOIR I MET THE PANKHURSTS 
AND THROUGH THEM THAT MY LIFE CHANGED 
WHENEVER I TRY TO EXPLAIN HOW MY LIFE HAS CHANGED 
I THINK OF A SONG WE USED TO SING IN THE CHOIR 
I SHAN'T SING IT TO YOU NOW BECAUSE I CAN'T SING 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU SOME OF THE WORDS 
THEY GO LIKE THIS 
FROM STREET AND SQUARE 
FROM HILL AND GLEN OF THIS VAST WORLD BEYOND MY DOOR 
I HEAR THE TREAD OF MARCHING ME THE PATIENT ARMIES OF THE POOR 
NOT ERMINE CLAD NOR CLOTHED IN STATE 
THEIR TITLE DEEDS NOT YET MADE PLAIN 
BUT WAKING EARLY TOILING LATE 
THE HEIRS OF ALL THE EARTH REMAIN 
AND IT FINISHES 
SOME DAY WITHOUT A TRUMPET CALL 
THE NEWS WILL O'ER THE WORLD BE BLOWN 
WHEN HERITAGE COMES BACK TO ALL 
THE MYRIAD MONARCHS TAKE THEIR OWN 
I AM ONE OF THE PATIENT ARMIES OF THE POOR AND SO ARE MOST OF YOU 
BUT WE ARE NOT CONTENT TO BE PATIENT ANY LONGER 
IT IS TIME TO TAKE BACK OUR HERITAGE 
IT IS TIME TO TAKE BACK OUR OWN 
AND I BELIEVE WE BELIEVE THE FIRST STEP MUST BE THE VOTE 
WE'VE ALL HEARD THE ANCIENT CRY 
NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION 
WELL I BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO ALTER THAT 
WHAT WE SHOULD SAY IS NO EXPLOITATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION 
NO SLUMS WITHOUT REPRESENTATION 
NO STARVATION NO OPPRESSION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION 
NO DEGRADATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION 
AND WHEN THE DAY COMES 
THAT THE WOMEN OF GREAT BRITAIN RECEIVE REPRESENTATION 
I PREDICT WE WILL LOOK AND WE WILL SEE 
THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE VANISHED 
THE SLUMS THE DEPRIVATION THE STARVATION 
AT THE VERY WORST WE CAN'T DO A WORSE JOB THAN OUR GENTLEMEN IN PARLIAMENT 
AND AT THE VERY BEST 
WE SHALL WALK EQUALLY WITH MEN 
AND WITH THEM TAKE POSSESSION OF OUR TRUE HERITAGE 
MY SISTERS I THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME 
ANNIE 
I APOLOGISE 
THERE'S NOTHING TO APOLOGISE FOR 
THE PEOPLE'S FLAG IS DEEPEST RED 
IT SHROUDED OFT OUR MARTYR'D DEAD 
AND ERE THEIR LIMBS GREW STIFF AND COLD 
THEIR HEARTS' BLOOD DYED ITS EV'RY FOLD 
THEN RAISE THE SCARLET BANNER HIGH 
WITHIN ITS SHADE WE'LL LIVE AND DIE 
THOUGH COWARDS FLINCH AND TRAITORS SNEER 
WE'LL KEEP THE RED FLAG FLYING HERE 
LOOK 
FIVE A DONATION FROM MRS. MONTE FIORE 
THAT MAKES NEARLY FIFTY IN DONATIONS AND PROFIT GOOD 
YES I AGREE MOST PEOPLE DO 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO LOBBY PARLIAMENT AGAIN TOMORROW LADY CARLISLE 
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT CAMPBELL BANNERMAN WILL RECEIVE A DEPUTATION IN THE NEAR FUTURE 
WE'D BE GRATEFUL IF YOU'D HAVE ANOTHER WORD WITH THE EARL OF LYTTON 
HE'LL RAISE THE QUESTION IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS 
THERE'S EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT MEMBERS FROM EACH OF THE PARTIES WILL AGREE TO PRESS FOR THE VOTE 
SOLIDARITY LADY CARLISLE YOU CANNAE BEAT SOLIDARITY 
TIRED JUST NEED FIVE MINUTES TO GET MY BREATH BACK 
DON'T WORRY 
IT REALLY HAPPENED 
MOTHER ALWAYS SAID YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR OWN STRENGTH UNTIL YOU TRY 
YOU EVEN GOT MONEY TO PAY SOME OF THE BILLS 
GOOD STILL GOT YOUR NOTEBOOK 
THERE'S MORE TO WRITE DOWN MORE EVERY DAY YES 
IT SAYS HERE 
LONDON WELL DONE CHRISTABEL 
THIS IS LONDON 
IN THE SUMMER WHEN I FINISH MY LAW STUDIES MOTHER'S SELLING UP IN MANCHESTER 
WE'RE MOVING DOWN HERE 
THE HEART OF THE EMPIRE 
OUR EMPIRE 
AND IT SAYS HERE 
SINGING THAT'S A FUNNY THING TO WRITE DOWN 
YOU SAID IN YOUR SPEECH TONIGHT YOU CAN'T SING I CAN'T 
YOU CAN SING ANNIE 
TONIGHT YOU DID 
I DID TAKE THEM ONCE OR TWICE 
DURING THE ODD SENTENCE IN THE SPEECH 
ME TALKING AND NOT SOMEONE ELSE THAT MAKES A CHANGE YOU SANG 
LOBBYING PARLIAMENT TOMORROW 
YES TONIGHT THE SONG TOMORROW WESTMINSTER 
THE DAY AFTER THE GREAT CITY 
LOOK 
ALL CHALK AND BREADCRUMBS 
COMRADES YE WHO HAVE DARED 
FIRST IN THE BATTLE TO STRIVE AND SORROW 
SCORNED SPURNED NOUGHT HAVE YE CARED 
RAISING YOUR EYES TO A WIDER MORROW 
WAYS THAT ARE WEARY DAYS THAT ARE DREARY 
TOIL AND PAIN BY FAITH YE HAVE BORNE 
HAIL HAIL VICTORS YE STAND 
WEARING THE WREATH THAT THE BRAVE HAVE WORN 
SHOUT SHOUT UP WITH YOUR SONG 
CRY WITH THE WIND FOR THE DAWN IS BREAKING 
MARCH MARCH SWING YOU ALONG 
WIDE BLOWS OUR BANNER AND HOPE IS WAKING 
FIRM IN RELIANCE LAUGH A DEFIANCE 
LAUGH IN HOPE FOR SURE IS THE END 
MARCH MARCH MANY AS ONE 
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER 
AND FRIEND TO FRIEND 
IS EVERYTHING O. K. EVERYTHING'S FINE 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BOY HE MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR 
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
HE'S FEEDING OFF HIS ANGER AND HIS GRIEF YOU CAN'T DO THIS 
FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE KEEPING HIM 
DAD DAD 
WAKING THE DEAD RETURNS NO
