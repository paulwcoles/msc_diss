SWING VOTERS THEIR WAY THE PRIZE 
THE MOST POWERFUL JOB IN LONDON 
WITH A BUDGET OF AROUND ELEVEN BILLION 
THE WINNER WILL HAVE THE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOW LONDON IS 
RUN OUR POLITICAL EDITOR TIM DONE 
VON HAS BEEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
WITH THEM THIS MORNING 
DO THEY THINK THEY CAN CHANGE 
OPINION IN THE LAST FEW HOURS I'M I'M NOT SURE ANY OF THE CANDIDATES CAN 
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE ON THE FINAL 
DAY BUT THERE ARE MANY VOTERS WHO 
WON'T HAVE COMPLETELY MADE UP THEIR 
MINDS YET THERE HAVE THAT 
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A LAST 
IMPRESSION TO CATCH A FEW EYES 
PERHAPS PERSUADE THE PERSON THAT IS 
NOT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SURE THAT YES IT IS 
WORTH VOTING FOR THAT MAN OR WOMAN 
AS MAYOR 
AS MAYOR 
AS MAYOR BORIS JOHNSON WAS UP EARLY THIS 
MORNING GREETING COMMUTERS INTO 
WATERLOO STATION 
I ASKED HIM WHAT IS HIS APPROACH TO 
HARD PRESSED COMMUTERS WITH THEIR 
HEADS DOWN IN THE RAIN 
HE SAID BREVITY IS THE ONLY WAY 
KEN LIVINGSTONE IN EAST LONDON HAS 
UNVEILED HIS FINAL CAMPAIGN POSTER 
DON'T VOTE FOR A JOKE HE SAYS 
HE IS STRESSING AGAIN THE VALUE OF 
CONTINUITY AND COMPETENCE TO GIVE 
HIM ANOTHER TERM BRIAN PADDICK FOR 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HAS BEEN OUT 
IN SOUTH WEST LONDON VISITING AN 
OLD PEOPLE'S HOME IT ISN'T OVER 
YET NONE OF THEM THINK THAT OF 
COURSE THEIR KEY MESSAGE GOES OUT 
TO THOSE UNDECIDED VOTERS 
TIM IS THERE ANY INDICATION HOW 
MANY VOTERS WILL TURN OUT 
NO NOT AT ALL BUT EVERYONE IS 
ANTICIPATING AFTER A FAIRLY LOW 
TURNOUT FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN IT WAS 
JUST THIRTY SIX PER CENT THAT THERE WILL BE MANY 
MORE PEOPLE TURNING OUT BECAUSE 
THIS CONTEST HAS BECOME SO CLOSE 
RIGHT UP TO THE WIRE IN FACT THE 
WEATHER COULD HAVE A CRUCIAL IMPACT 
BECAUSE IT IS INEVITABLE IF WE GET 
A REPEAT OF THIS AWFUL WEATHER 
TOMORROW THAT WILL DEPRESS VOTES 
IT'S NOT POLLSTERS WE NEED IT'S 
PETER COCKROFT 
WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE THREE 
MAIN CANDIDATES LIVE ON OUR 
PROGRAMME AT SIX THIRTY P. M. 
AN INQUIRY IS UNDER WAY AT A CARE 
HOME WITH WHERE A DEMENTIA PATIENT 
ACCIDENTALLY STRANGLED HIMSELF 
AFTER BEING LEFT UNSUPERVISED 
AN INSPECTION OF THE ALEXANDRA CARE 
CENTRE SAID SEVEN AREAS NEEDED TO 
BE IMPROVED 
MOTORISTS ARE FACING SECOND DAY 
OF TRAFFIC DISRUPTION AFTER A 
BUILDING COLLAPSED IN TOOTING BEC 
THE ROAD REMAINS CLOSED WHILST A 
CLEAN UP OPERATION TO REMOVE THE 
RUBBLE CONTINUES 
A GROUP OF M. P.'S HAS ACCUSED THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
ORGANISERS OF SPENDING MONEY LIKE 
WATER THE COMMONS SELECT COMMITTEE 
SAYS THE TREBLING OF THE ORIGINAL 
OLYMPIC BUDGET IS UNDERMINING 
PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE MANAGEMENT 
OF THE EVENT IT ALSO DOUBTS THAT 
ORGANISERS WILL RECRUIT THE 
ESTIMATED EIGHTEEN BILLION POUNDS FROM 
LAND SALES AFTER THE GAMES 
CAMERAS HAVE BEEN USED TO CATCH 
ROGUE ROAD USERS FOR YEARS NOW 
PARENTS WHO PARK ILLEGALLY OUTSIDE 
SCHOOL GATES CAN BE CAUGHT USING 
MOBILE C. C. T. V. IT COMES AFTER ANOTHER 
LONDON COUNCIL STARTED 
EXPERIMENTING WITH CHARGING PARENTS 
TO PARK OUTSIDE SCHOOLS 
THIS CAR IS ON SPECIAL SORT OF 
SCHOOL RUN NO CHILDREN TO DROP OFF 
INSTEAD IT'S SPYING ON THE CARS 
THAT ARE PARENTS ARE FILMED AND 
CAN BE FINED FOR STOPPING IN THE 
WRONG PLACE HARROW COUNCIL'S 
RESPONDING TO CONCERNS OF LOCAL 
SCHOOLS SCHOOLS WE HAVE A SLOT OF TEN MINUTES WHERE 
THERE ARE MANY MANY PARENTS 
DROPPING OFF THEIR CHILDREN 
HURRYING TO WHERE ARE THEY'RE GOING 
NEXT DROPPING CHILDREN ON THE 
YELLOW LINES NOT TURNING ENGINES 
OFF NOT PARKING PROPERLY CHILDREN 
LITERALLY OPENING DOORS AND JUMPING 
OUT OF CARS 
THIS IS THE SORT OF 
BEHAVIOUR THEY WANT TO STOP NO 
FINES TODAY FOR NOW JUST A 
DETERRENT TO TRY AND PREVENT THE 
DAILY CHAOS 
WE HAVE THE CAMERA 
WHICH EXTENDS UP IN THE AIR WE CAN 
PAN AROUND WITH IT 
THE PROCESS IS 
SIMPLE ONCE C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE IS 
CAPTURED A PHOTO AND FINE ARE SENT 
TO TROUBLEMAKERS HARROW COUNCIL 
DENIES MOTORISTS ARE BEING UNFAIRLY 
TARGETED 
THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL TARGETED HAS SENT OUT LEAFLETS THEY'VE SENT 
PARENTS AND TEACHERS OUT TO TRY AND 
PERSUADE PARENTS NOT TO BEHAVE IN 
THIS WAY BUT THEY'VE CONTINUED TO 
DO SO IT'S NOT BIG BROTHER WE ARE 
LOOKING AFTER THE MAJORITY 
THIS IS 
JUST A TRIAL AT THE MOMENT IF 
PARENTS KEEP BREAKING THE LAW THEY 
COULD FACE FINES OF UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
IF THEY PAY IN TIME IN THE 
MEANTIME THIS CAR CAN BE USED TO 
PATROL THINGS LIKE YELLOW BOX 
JUNCTIONS THE SCHOOL RUN'S FAST 
BECOMING A BATTLEGROUND SOME 
COUNCILS ARE CONSIDERING SCHOOL RUN 
PARKING PERMITS 
I'VE TRIED TELLING 
PARENTS HERE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T 
STOP THEY'VE BECOME ABUSIVE IT'S 
A REALLY GOOD IDEA 
IF PEOPLE DON'T 
PARK SAFELY SOMETHING HAS TO BE 
DONE ABOUT IT 
GO THIS IS TRIAL IS 
SUCCESSFUL THIS CAR COULD BECOME A 
REGULAR FEATURE IN HARROW AND 
BEYOND 
COULD THIS BECOME A FAMILIAR SIGHT 
ON THE STREETS OF LONDON AND HELP 
SOLVE SOME CONGESTION PROBLEMS THE 
COMMITTEE OF M. P.'S WANTS THE SEGWAYS 
TO BE ALLOWED IN CYCLE LANES ONE 
OF THE M. P.'S IS THE SHADOW TRANSPORT 
MINISTER IS ROBERT GOODWILL WHY DO 
YOU WANT THESE ON THE STREETS WHAT WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THE GOVERNMENT 
HAVE CONDEMNED THESE OUT OF HAND 
AND MAYBE CARRY OUT A PROPER 
APPRAISE ALOF WHERE THE VEHICLES 
COULD BE USED ON CYCLE WAYS OR 
FOOT PATHS L. SUSPECT NOT BUT ON 
THE ROADS THERE ARE MANY COUNTRIES 
AROUND THE WORLD THAT ARE USING 
THEM THE POLICE IN MIAMI USE THEM 
AND WE THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS 
BEING SHORT SIGHTED IN RULING OUT 
THIS POTENTIALLY GREEN VEHICLE 
WITHOUT DOING ALL THE WORK I'VE I'VE ACTUALLY HAD A GO ON ONE AND IT IS 
ACTUALLY QUITE DIFFICULT TO STEER 
ARE THEY REALLY SAFE ENOUGH TO BE 
ON THE ROADS OF LONDON 
I THINK 
WITH A BIT OF PRACTICE THEY ARE 
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD L. HAD A GO 
IN BLACKPOOL AND I SUSPECT UNLESS 
YOU ARE PRESIDENT BUSH YOU ARE 
GOING TO GET THE HANG OF IT THEY 
ARE ZERO CARBON AND THEY ARE VERY 
GREEN IF WE CAN GET PEOPLE OUT OF 
THEIR CARS IT WILL HELP THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
THEY ARE NOT REALISTIC ENVIRONMENT THE TOP SPEED IS THIRTEEN M. P. H. EVEN 
PUTTING THEM IN A CYCLE LANE IT 
WOULD BE DANGEROUS 
THOSE ARE SORT 
OF GEZ WE NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO 
GET THE ANSWERS TO AND THE 
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT HAVE THE 
RESOURCES TO DO THIS WORK THEY CAN 
LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE 
VEHICLES HAVE TAKEN HOLD A LOT OF 
AIRPORTS AROUND THE WORLD ARE USING 
THESE FOR THEIR STAFF TO GET AROUND 
THE AIRPORTS LONG WALKS BETWEEN 
THE GATES SO WE ARE NOT MAKING UP 
OUR OWN MINDS BUT WE ARE CONCERNED 
THAT GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY MADE UP 
ITS MIND AGAINST THEM AND 
POTENTIALLY TURNED ITS BACK ON A 
GREEN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF TRANSPORT 
WE MUST LIKE IT ROBERT GOODWILL 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FOOTBALL 
CHELSEA AIM TO REACH THE CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE FINAL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
THEIR HISTORY THE BLUES HOST 
LIVERPOOL TONIGHT IN THE SECOND LEG 
AVRAM GRANT'S SIDE ARE FAVOURITES 
AFTER A ONE TO ONE DRAW IN THEIR FIRST LEG 
AT ANFIELD DIDIER DROGBA HAS ONE 
OF THE LARGEST EGOS IN FOOTBALL 
GRANTED HE'S ONE OF THE WORLD'S 
FINEST STRIKERS BUT HE CAN BE A 
HANDFUL FOR OPPONENTS AND TEAM 
MATES ALIKE LIVERPOOL HAVE MADE 
SPECIAL POINT OF TARGETING DROGBA 
WITH TWO WORDS THEY BELIEVE HE IS A 
DIVER AND A CHEAT 
I WAS CLEAR AND 
WATCHING A LOT OF GAMES I THINK 
EVERYBODY CAN HAVE THE SAME 
CONCLUSION AND THE THE SAME IDEA 
DROGBA IS FANTASTIC PLAYER BUT HI 
WILL NOT SPEAK ABOUT THE PLAYERS OF 
LIVERPOOL AND I DON'T LIKE 
BECAUSE HE LOOKS SO POWERFUL AND 
THE DEFENDERS THINK THAT THERE IS 
OTHER WAYS TO STOP HIM BECAUSE HE 
IS MORE STRONGER THAN THEM TO TO REACH THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE HAS LONG 
BEEN CHELSEA'S OVERRIDING AMBITION 
JOSE MOURINHO NEVER DELIVERED AND 
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM THIS 
YEAR THERE IS ADDED SPICE 
MANCHESTER UNITED AWAIT CHELSEA IN 
THREE WEEKS' TIME FOR THE FIRST 
EVER ALL ENGLISH CUP FINAL AND IT 
IS IN MOSCOW 
WE HAVE SHOWN MANY 
TIMES IN THE LEAGUE OR IN THE CUPS 
SO I THINK THE MENTAL STRENGTH WE 
SURELY HAVE WE JUST NEED TO HAVE A 
LITTLE BIT OF LUCK 
CHELSEA HAVEN'T 
BEEN BEATEN IN THEIR LAST SIXTY SIX 
MATCHES AT STAMFORD BRIDGE AND 
LIVERPOOL HAVE FAILED TO SCORE ON 
THEIR PREVIOUS EIGHT VISITS 
ADVANTAGE CHELSEA THEN WE'LL FIND

STORY GREAT SWIRL OF CLOUD OVER 
BRITAIN AND YOU WILL NOTICE THE 
SWIRL IS CENTRED ON US WE HAVE GOT 
LOW PRESSURE SITTING RIGHT OVER 
TORCH LONDON AS IS USUAL IT WILL 
BE WET IT WILL STAY WET MORE 
OUTBREAKS OF RAIN PEGGING 
TEMPERATURES TO JUST TWELVE OR THIRTEEN 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT L. SUPPOSE 
THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THE SOUTH 
WESTERLY WIND WILL START TO BLOW 
THE HEAVIEST OF THE SHOWERS AWAY 
BUT THERE WILL STILL BE RAIN AT 
STAMFORD BRIDGE THIS EVENING WE'LL 
KEEP YOU UPDATED ON THE SCORE WE 
ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE RAIN 
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT L. THINK PROBABLY

NOW OR AS MUCH AS WE'LL HAVE THIS 
EVENING TEMPERATURES AT SIXES AND 
SEVENS ONCE AGAIN TOMORROW THE 
SHOWERS WILL GET GOING FOR THE 
VOTERS POLLING STATIONS OPEN AT

REPRESENTATIVES LOTS OF LOCAL 
COUNCIL ELECTIONS OUTSIDE LONDON

WE COULD HAVE THE SHOWERS GANGING 
UP ON A FEW PLACES TO GIVE US 
LONGER SPELLS OF RAIN AND LIKE THE 
ELECTIONS HERE I THINK THE WEEKEND
