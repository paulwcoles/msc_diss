MANKIND HAS CREATED BRILLIANT ARCHITECTURE ALL OVER THE WORLD 
BUILDINGS SHAPED BY OUR AMBITIONS OUR INSTINCTS 
OUR HOPES AND DREAMS 
SHARED HUMAN DESIRES THAT INSPIRED INCREDIBLE BUILDINGS 
THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW ARCHITECTURE HAS DEFINED THE WAY WE LIVE 
THE ARCHITECTURE OF TYRANNY AND POWER 
ARCHITECTURE TO LIFT THE HUMAN SPIRIT 
THE ARCHITECTURE OF DEATH AND RESURRECTION 
AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF PARADISE ON EARTH 
MY JOURNEY STARTS WITH MAN'S DREAM OF CREATING BEAUTY 
ON TOP OF THE WORLD THE BEAUTY OF A SIMPLE IGLOO 
IN THE FAR EAST THE BEAUTY OF A SACRED FACE 
THE BRILLIANT DECORATION OF A RUSSIAN PALACE 
THE DIVINE BEAUTY OF HUMAN PASSION 
PROCLAIMED ON AN INDIAN TEMPLE 
AND THE TERRIFYING BEAUTY OF A TOWERING FRENCH CATHEDRAL 
I'M IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE TRAVELLING TOWARDS THE NORTH POLE ACROSS A FROZEN WORLD 
THIS IS A VAST LIMITLESS LAND 
IT FEELS AS OLD AS THE EARTH ITSELF 
PURE UNCHANGING 
GOLLY BEING HERE IS LIKE BEING AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME 
I'VE COME TO CELEBRATE AN ANCIENT ELEMENTAL AND BEAUTIFUL STRUCTURE 
BUT BECAUSE TEMPERATURES IN THE ARCTIC ARE RISING FASTER 
THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IT'S A STRUCTURE THAT COULD SOON BE LOST FOREVER 
MY GUIDE IS ANDREAS SANIMUINAQ 
AND TOGETHER WE'RE GOING TO BUILD AN IGLOO 
A STRUCTURE THAT REVEALS THE ORIGIN OF ARCHITECTURE 
WHEN MAN FIRST CREATED SHELTER FROM HOSTILE WEATHER AND PROWLING BEASTS 
SO THIS IS GOOD SNOW 
YEAH VERY GOOD SNOW HERE 
THE IGLOO A CREATION OF THE INUIT CULTURE 
WAS USED AS A WINTER HOME AND SHELTER ON HUNTING EXPEDITIONS 
THE PEOPLE HERE STILL HUNT BUT FEW BUILD IGLOOS 
ANDREAS IS ONE OF THE LAST MEN TO KEEP THE TRADITION ALIVE 
USING KNOWLEDGE PASSED DOWN FROM HIS FATHER 
A LEGENDARY HUNTER 
IT'S BIG 
IT'S VERY BIG 
THAT'S AMBITIOUS 
THE BLOCKS ARE CUT FROM SNOW 
COMPACTED BY THE WIND TO THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY 
I MEAN HOW MANY BLOCKS DO WE NEED 
HOW MANY I DON'T KNOW GUESS 
MAYBE FIVE TEEN FIFTY 
FIVE OH FIFTY 
A LOT OF WORK O. K. THEY'RE HEAVY 
SO I TAKE ER 
FIFTY GOOD LORD 
AH RIGHT 
LONDON SEEMS SWEET AT THIS MOMENT 
DOES IT MATTER WHERE WE PUT THE FIRST BLOCK 
O. K. 
THE BLOCKS ARE LAID IN A CLOCKWISE DIRECTION 
FOLLOWING THE MOTION OF THE SUN 
AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE SKY FROM DAWN TO DUSK 
THE WAY IT WORKS IS VERY SIMPLE 
THIS PARTICULAR SORT OF DOME IS LIKE THE TOP OF AN EGGSHELL 
IT'S A SORT OF OVOID DOME NOT A SEMICIRCLE SO THAT THE FORCES 
THE WEIGHT OF THE BLOCKS AND THEY ARE HEAVY I CAN TELL YOU 
ARE TAKEN MORE OR LESS STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE GROUND 
THE TROUBLE WITH LOTS OF DOMES IS THEY THRUST OUTWARDS AND WANT TO FALL DOWN 
BUT THE IGLOO IS INCREDIBLY STRONG AND IT SUPPORTS ITS OWN WEIGHT 
AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS BESIDES WHEN IT'S COMPLETED 
BUT IT IS QUITE HARD WORK TO BUILD 
THE MIRACLE OF THE IGLOO IS THAT THE WEAKEST BUILDING MATERIAL POSSIBLE 
FROZEN WATER ACHIEVES STRENGTH THROUGH BRILLIANT ENGINEERING 
AFTER A COUPLE OF LAYERS OF BLOCKS THE WALLS START SLOPING INWARDS 
ANDREAS CUTS ONE INTO A WEDGE SHAPE 
A LOT OF INTUITIVE ENGINEERING SKILLS HERE WITH ANDREAS 
HE'S MAKING THIS STRUCTURE SORT OF PERFORM IN AN AMAZING WAY 
AS FAR AS I CAN UNDERSTAND IT 
THE BLOCKS START TO SPIRAL UP AT SOME POINT DOWN HERE 
AND EACH BLOCK IS CUNNINGLY SHAPED 
IT'S ALL HELD TOGETHER BY A GOOD BIT OF BASHING AND MANOEUVRING 
WHICH CREATES FRICTION WHICH SORT OF MELTS A BIT OF THE SNOW 
AND THEN THAT FREEZES AND IT ALL STAYS FIRM 
SO REALLY IT'S SORT OF BEING GLUED TOGETHER WITH ICE 
IGLOOS ARE IMMENSELY STRONG WHEN COMPLETED BUT CONSTRUCTING A DOME 
WITHOUT PROPS OR SCAFFOLDING IS A PERILOUS UNDERTAKING 
I'M REALLY BEGINNING TO WONDER ABOUT THIS IGLOO 
IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE IT'S ABOUT TO CAVE IN ON ME 
AND THE NEXT COURSE ABOVE THIS IS GONNA BE EVEN STEEPER VIRTUALLY HORIZONTAL 
CAN'T QUITE SEE HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK 
THE FINAL STAGES ARE HAZARDOUS 
PROBLEMATIC JOINS ARE FIXED WITH INTRICATE ICE CARPENTRY 
AND THE FAMILIAR SHAPE KEEPS ON GROWING 
THE DOME IS REGARDED AS ONE OF THE HIGH POINTS OF OUR ARCHITECTURAL CULTURE 
PARTICULARLY CELEBRATED AS A HALLMARK OF ROMAN ENGINEERING GENIUS 
YET IN THIS CULTURE ISOLATED REMOTE FROM OUR OWN 
THE DOME ALSO DEVELOPED TO MEET PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS AND DEMANDS 
IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT TWO CULTURES SO DIFFERENT 
SHOULD COME UP WITH THE SAME ARCHITECTURAL FORM 
DOGS DOGS AH 
WE'RE INTERRUPTED BY A HUNTER RETURNING TO HIS VILLAGE 
SO CAN I SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT HERE 
POLAR BEAR POLAR BEAR REALLY 
ARE THERE MANY POLAR BEARS AROUND HERE 
A LOT YES MANY 
MANY CAN I SEE 
WELL IT'S VERY SHOCKING ISN'T IT A POLAR BEAR SHOT 
I FEEL SHOCKED BUT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER 
THIS IS NOT SHOT FOR FUN IT'S NOT SHOT BY A TOURIST AS A TROPHY 
THIS CHAP'S A MEMBER OF ONE OF THE LAST TRUE HUNTING COMMUNITIES IN THE WORLD HE'S A LICENSED HUNTER 
THESE GUYS HAVE TO HUNT TO LIVE THAT'S IT 
SO THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO KEEP HIM AND HIS FAMILY ALIVE 
THE FOOD THE SKIN EATING AND SELLING 
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER 
BUT IT'S VERY MOVING THOUGH VERY MOVING 
THERE IT IS THIS WONDERFUL BEAST THE POLAR BEAR 
ITS PLAINTIVE EXPRESSION IS HEARTBREAKING 
OH I SEE 
BACK INSIDE ALL THAT REMAINS ARE THE FINISHING TOUCHES 
GOOD GOOD SO THAT'S HALF 
YEAH THAT'S IT 
SO YOU SPIN IT 
I SEE I SEE 
CUNNING 
IT'S THE KEYSTONE OR CAPSTONE 
FINE WELL DONE ANDREAS WELL DONE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH CONGRATULATIONS EXCELLENT 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL IGLOO 
TENSE AT MOMENTS BUT THANK GOODNESS WE'VE FINISHED IT 
IT LOOKS TERRIFIC INSIDE 
HERE WE ARE IT'S COMPLETE 
AN INCREDIBLE SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE OUR OWN IGLOO 
I MUST ADMIT EXTERNALLY IT LOOKS A TRIFLE PECULIAR 
A RATHER PERSONAL PIECE OF WORK 
MORE OF A CONE THAN A DOME 
A BIT LIKE A BEEHIVE BUT IT'S IMMENSELY STRONG 
I MUST SAY STANDING HERE CONTEMPLATING IT 
IT LOOKS LIKE A REALLY ANCIENT PIECE OF ARCHITECTURE 
THE FIRST BUILDING IN THE WORLD 
INSIDE THE DOME IS SUPERB SUBLIME 
IT WORKS 
THE IGLOO IS A WONDROUS MACHINE 
THE SNOW BLOCKS OF COURSE ARE COLD 
BUT WONDERFUL INSULATORS AND MY BODY IS HOT 
AND THIS HEAT MELTS THE SURFACE OF THE SNOW 
AND THE LIQUID WOULD RUN INTO THE CRACKS HERE FREEZE AND SEAL THEM 
SO THE WHOLE THING REALLY BECOMES A BUILDING OF ICE 
RATHER THAN SNOW EVENTUALLY MUCH STRONGER 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
THE IGLOO CONTAINS ALL THE BASIC IDEAS OF ARCHITECTURE 
IT'S A PRACTICAL SHELTER 
AND A MINIATURE MASTERPIECE OF ENGINEERING 
BUT ABOVE ALL THE IGLOO'S BEAUTIFUL 
BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE OF THE LOGIC 
THE CLARITY OF THE THINKING BEHIND ITS DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION 
BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE IT SEEMS SO SIMPLE 
YET IS ALSO SO COMPLEX IN ITS FUNCTION 
AND OF COURSE BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE OF ITS FORM 
THE CELESTIAL DOME THE SYMBOL OF THE SUN IN THIS ICY LAND 
THIS IS THE CITY OF LESHAN IN THE HEART OF CHINA'S SICHUAN PROVINCE 
SICHUAN IS FAMOUS THE WORLD OVER FOR ITS FIERY AND EXHILARATING FOOD 
GOSH THAT IS DELICIOUS BUT IT IS INDEED VERY SPICY HOT 
ALL THESE ARE CHILLIES 
BUT THERE'S NOT JUST FOOD FOR THE BODY IN LESHAN 
THERE'S ALSO FOOD FOR THE SOUL 
IN THIS CITY THERE'S AN OBJECT THAT FORMS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND THE SPIRITUAL 
AN OBJECT THAT USES BEAUTY AND SCALE TO INFLAME THE IMAGINATION 
TO OVERAWE THE SENSES 
LESHAN WAS ONCE A FISHING VILLAGE SURROUNDED BY TREACHEROUS WATERS 
THERE'S A LOCAL LEGEND THE WATER WAS CONTROLLED BY AN EVIL SPIRIT 
BUT IN THE EIGHTH CENTURY 
BUDDHIST MONKS CREATED A COLOSSUS TO CALM THE TORRENTS 
OVER THERE ACROSS THESE WATERS 
IS THE LARGEST STONE CARVED IMAGE OF THE BUDDHA FROM THE ANCIENT WORLD 
I'M AGOG TO SEE IT 
HERE HE IS THE GIANT BUDDHA AT LESHAN 
GOLLY HE'S ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS 
EVERYTHING ABOUT SUCH A VAST WORK OF ART 
MADE OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WITH SO MUCH EFFORT 
IS FULL OF MEANING THE POSTURE THE PROPORTIONS THE DETAILS 
THE SOLEMN AND SERENE EXPRESSION ON THE BUDDHA'S FACE 
THIS IS BEAUTY AT A TRULY SUBLIME SCALE 
CARVED OUT OF THE ROCK FACE 
THE BUDDHA IS OVER SEVENTY METRES HIGH AND TOOK NINETY YEARS TO COMPLETE 
AND IT REMAINS A WONDER 
A SCULPTURE SO LARGE THAT IT'S A WORK OF ARCHITECTURE 
THIS TOWERING COMPELLING SPIRITUALLY CHARGED BEAUTY 
DRAWS PEOPLE HERE IN THEIR THOUSANDS TOURISTS AND BELIEVERS 
THE BUDDHA LIVED AROUND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
FOR BELIEVERS THE BUDDHA BROUGHT TO HUMANITY THE KEY TO ENLIGHTENMENT 
THE WAY TO ESCAPE WORLDLY DESIRES AND REACH NIRVANA 
GRADUALLY THE BUDDHA THE WISE MAN AND GREAT TEACHER 
WAS WORSHIPPED AS A GOD AND AROUND ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
HE STARTED TO BE PORTRAYED NOT IN ALMOST ABSTRACT FORM 
AS A COLUMN OR AS A WHEEL BUT AS A HUMAN BEING 
I SUPPOSE THAT MADE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO IDENTIFY WITH HIM 
AND FROM THE VERY START THIS HUMAN PORTRAYAL OF BUDDHA WAS OFTEN ON A VAST SCALE 
CLEARLY IN BUDDHISM SIZE MATTERED 
THE BIGGER THE MORE BEAUTIFUL 
WHEN IT WAS FIRST CREATED 
THE BUDDHA WAS ENCLOSED BY AN IMMENSE WOODEN TEMPLE 
ONLY HIS FACE WAS LEFT EXPOSED 
MONKS WOULD HAVE SHELTERED UNDER THE BUDDHA'S SHADOW 
LIVING AND WORSHIPPING IN THESE SMALL CAVES IN THE CLIFF FACE 
SO THE BUDDHA WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHIN A TEMPLE AN ENCLOSED SPACE 
IMAGINE THE ATMOSPHERE 
THE CHANTING THE COLOURS THE GREAT IMAGE TOWERING ABOVE 
HERE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAT MEDITATING 
CONCENTRATING ON THE COLOSSAL SCALE OF THE IMAGE 
IT WOULD HAVE LIBERATED THEIR IMAGINATION 
AN INCREDIBLE MOVING EXPERIENCE 
FOR THEM SITTING HERE THE GREAT BUDDHA IN FRONT OF THEM 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LIVING BEING INCREDIBLE 
PILGRIMS WALK CLOCKWISE ROUND THE BUDDHA 
SEEKING A PATH TO ENLIGHTENMENT 
THE HUGE SIZE OF THE IMAGE REVEALS THAT HIS SPIRITUAL POWER IS WITHOUT LIMIT 
THE BUDDHA COMES IN MANY DIFFERENT FORMS 
AND THE LESHAN STATUE HAS A PARTICULAR MEANING 
AH THE HEAD OF BUDDHA AT LAST 
WE MEET FACE TO FACE 
IN FACT THIS COLOSSAL IMAGE OF BUDDHA 
IS A PARTICULAR MANIFESTATION OF THE BUDDHA 
IT'S MAITREYA A BUDDHA TO BE A BUDDHA OF THE FUTURE 
QUITE WHEN MAITREYA ARRIVES IS A MATTER OF DEBATE 
IT SEEMS HE'LL COME WHEN HE'S NEEDED 
WHEN THE OLD BUDDHIST FAITH IS ERODED 
WHEN THE WORLD IS COMING TO ITS END WHEN THE WORLD IS IN EXTREMIS 
WHEN PILGRIMS ASCEND THIS MOUNTAIN AND BEHOLD MAITREYA'S FACE 
THEY MUST FEEL THEY'VE ALREADY REACHED NIRVANA 
THIS IS A BEAUTY THAT COULD SAVE THEIR SOULS 
AS WITH A SACRED BUILDING 
EVERY DETAIL ON THE HEAD IS FULL OF MEANING 
THE EARS WITH THE LONG EARLOBES 
THAT REFLECTS AN ORIENTAL IDEA OF BEAUTY 
SIGNIFYING A DEVELOPED REFINED HUMAN BEING 
THE EYES WITH THEIR TRANSCENDENTAL GAZE 
THAT SHOWS THAT THE BUDDHA IS FULL OF BLISS 
COMPASSION UNDERSTANDING 
THE LITTLE COILED BUNS OF HAIR ON HIS HEAD EACH LIKE A LITTLE SHRINE 
A DIAGRAM IN ITSELF TO INSPIRE AND HELP MEDITATION 
ON THE TOP OFTHE HEAD IS THIS BUMP 
THE BUMP THAT REFLECTS THE POSSESSION OF A COSMIC BRAIN 
THAT'S THE ROUTE TO NIRVANA 
MONKS NO LONGER LIVE IN THE CLIFF FACE BUT THEY STILL WORSHIP HERE 
BUDDHISM WAS REPRESSED DURING CHINA'S CULTURAL REVOLUTION 
THIS TEMPLE LOCATED JUST BEHIND THE BUDDHA'S HEAD WAS SHUT DOWN 
BUT MONKS AND BELIEVERS HAVE RETURNED ONCE MORE TO PRAY FOR THE ARRIVAL OF MAITREYA 
SO MAITREYA'S THE BUDDHA OF THE FUTURE 
BUT WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN 
DOES THAT MEAN WE SHOULD HAVE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE 
MAITREYA IS SUPPOSED TO RETURN WHEN THE WORLD'S IN TORMENT 
AND PERHAPS THAT MOMENT IS NOW 
THE LESHAN BUDDHA IS SLOWLY BEING DEFACED BY POLLUTION 
THE BUDDHA RECEIVED A MAJOR FACELIFT IN TWO THOUSAND ONE 
AND IS NOW BADLY STAINED AGAIN 
THESE CHAPS ARE TRYING TO BRUSH AWAY THESE DARK STAINS 
THE TRACKS OF TEARS 
THE TROUBLE IS THE ACID RAIN IS SLOWLY REMORSELESSLY 
ERODING THE SANDSTONE 
WROUGHT FROM THE ENTIRE CLIFF FACE 
THIS GIANT FIGURE CREATES A SENSE OF AWE 
IT'S A PERSONIFICATION OF THE WONDER AND THE WISDOM OF NATURE 
FOR ME THE FANTASTIC GIANT BUDDHA 
IS EMBLEMATIC OF THE BEAUTY OF THE WORLD 
A WORLD THAT MAN NOW SEEMS SET ON DESTROYING 
THROUGH RUTHLESS EXPLOITATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES 
THROUGH GLOBAL WARMING THROUGH POLLUTION THROUGH ACID RAIN 
INCREDIBLY THE GIANT BUDDHA 
IS A WARNING FROM THE PAST TO THE PRESENT ABOUT THE FUTURE 
SAINT PETERSBURG IN THE DEPTHS OF WINTER 
IT'S RUSSIA'S MOST FASHIONABLE CITY 
EVEN WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS WAY BELOW ZERO 
THE CITY WAS FOUNDED BY PETER THE GREAT THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
BUT SAINT PETERSBURG IS ALSO THE TRIUMPH OF A GREAT WOMAN 
PETER'S DAUGHTER EMPRESS ELIZABETH I 
IT WAS HER TASTE FOR OPULENCE AND GRANDEUR THAT MADE SAINT PETERSBURG BEAUTIFUL 
SHE DRESSED UP THE CITY IN COLOURFUL AND EXTRAVAGANT BAROQUE ARCHITECTURE 
THAT EXPRESSED NATIONAL PRIDE 
AND I'VE COME TO SEE ELIZABETH'S MOST PERSONAL AND ORNATE CREATION 
IN NORTHWEST RUSSIA RISING FROM THE SNOW 
IS A HOT BLOODED BAROQUE MASTERPIECE 
IT'S RUSSIA'S OWN VERSAILLES A BUILDING IN WHICH BEAUTY 
IS USED AS A POLITICAL WEAPON AS AN EXPRESSION OF DIVINE MAJESTY 
THIS IS THE CATHERINE PALACE 
WHICH ELIZABETH NAMED AFTER HER BELOVED MOTHER 
THIS PALACE WAS DESIGNED IN THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTIES 
BY AN ARCHITECT WITH ITALIAN BLOOD BARTOLOMEO RASTRELLI 
THE BUILDING'S ENORMOUS LENGTH 
IS A GRAND DISPLAY OF IMPERIAL POWER AND ORDER 
BUT THIS INTIMIDATING SCALE 
IS ENLIVENED WITH EXUBERANT AND JOYFUL DETAILS 
RASTRELLI'S THE ARCHITECT BUT THIS BUILDING'S NOT ABOUT HIM 
HE WAS MERELY THE MEANS BY WHICH ELIZABETH EXPRESSED HER NATURE 
HER PASSIONS HER LOVES HER ASPIRATIONS 
THIS BUILDING'S AN ALMOST SHOCKINGLY PERSONAL PORTRAIT OF A MOST UNUSUAL WOMAN 
THE EXTERIOR OF THE CATHERINE PALACE 
IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST SENSATIONAL CLASSICAL COMPOSITIONS 
BUT THE REAL GLORIES ARE INSIDE 
THE PALACE IS ORGANISED AROUND THE GOLDEN ENFILADE 
AN AWE INSPIRING ROUTE THAT TOOK YOU TO THE IMPERIAL PRESENCE 
THE STRAIGHT ROUTE THROUGH ELIZABETH'S PALACE 
ORIGINALLY NEARLY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE METRES IN LENGTH 
WAS LIKE A TEST FOR THOSE GRANTED ADMISSION TO THIS MAGICAL WORLD 
THE HIGHEST IN THE LAND AND THOSE MOST IN FAVOUR WITH THE EMPRESS WOULD PENETRATE DEEPEST 
THE GRANDEST ROOM WAS THE COLOSSAL GREAT HALL 
WHERE ELIZABETH RECEIVED VISITORS WHILE SEATED ON HER THRONE 
THE VASTNESS OF THE HALL THE HUGE ARRAY OF MIRRORS AND GILDED FIGURES 
WERE DESIGNED TO BEWITCH THE SENSES AND CONFIRM HER GODLIKE STATUS 
THIS WASN'T ONLY ELIZABETH'S THRONE ROOM BUT ALSO HER PLAYROOM 
THIS BECAME THE CENTRE OF HER HEDONISTIC WORLD 
IT WAS HERE THAT SHE HELD HER FAMED METAMORPHOSES BALLS 
IN WHICH MEN DRESSED AS WOMEN AND WOMEN DRESSED AS MEN 
SUCH CROSS DRESSING IN PARTIES IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WASN'T UNUSUAL 
BUT MOSTLY PEOPLE WOULD WEAR MASKS 
BUT HERE BY ELIZABETH'S ORDERS NOBODY WORE MASKS 
PEOPLE WERE THEMSELVES BUT STRANGELY TRANSFORMED 
WHICH IS I SUPPOSE WHY THESE PARTIES WERE NOT VERY POPULAR 
WITH ELIZABETH'S COURTIERS AND NOBLES 
AND AS PRIVILEGED VISITORS MOVED DEEPER INTO THE PALACE 
THE DECORATIVE SCHEMES BECAME EVER MORE INGENIOUS 
THIS REALLY IS ONE OF THE STRANGEST ROOMS IN THE PALACE 
THE WALLS ARE COVERED BY OLD MASTER OIL PAINTINGS PURCHASED BY ELIZABETH 
BUT ORGANISED NOT BY SUBJECT STYLE ARTIST OR DATE 
BUT SIMPLY BY SIZE AND BY COLOUR 
THEY'RE RAMMED TOGETHER TO MAKE A SORT OF MOSAIC A SORT OF MASSIVE TAPESTRY 
THIS REALLY IS A TRIUMPH OF INTERIOR DECORATION 
AH NOW I CAN MEET ELIZABETH HERSELF 
THIS PORTRAIT SHOWS HER IN HER PRIME 
IT'S ALL TO DO WITH POWER AND WEALTH EXPRESSED THROUGH BEAUTY 
BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURE AND BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES 
AND WHAT OF THE WOMAN BENEATH ALL THIS POMP LOOK AT HER FACE 
IT LOOKS HOMELY SOMEWHAT EARTHY 
FAR FROM CRUEL AND ARROGANT SHE LOVED ARCHITECTURE 
AND SHE CREATED ONE OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR BUILDINGS IN THE WORLD 
I LIKE HER 
BUT ELIZABETH'S GREATEST TRIUMPH WAS THE INSTALLATION OF THE AMBER ROOM 
THE CROWNING ARCHITECTURAL GLORY OF HER REIGN 
THIS IS A ROOM WITH AN ALMOST MAGICAL QUALITY 
IT'S HAUNTED THE WESTERN IMAGINATION FOR CENTURIES 
IT'S BEEN REGARDED AS THE MOST ENIGMATIC AND BEAUTIFUL ROOM EVER CREATED 
IT'S BEEN CALLED THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD 
IT'S A HYMN TO THE BEAUTY OF NATURE 
BECAUSE ITS WALLS ARE COVERED WITH AMBER 
A VERY VALUABLE NATURAL MATERIAL 
THAT ANCIENTLY WAS THOUGHT TO BE SUNLIGHT PETRIFIED 
ENCOMPASS THE POWER OF THE SUN GOD 
AND WHAT A VERY APPROPRIATE MATERIAL FOR AN IMPERIAL PALACE 
AMBER MADE FROM FOSSILISED TREE RESIN WAS RARE AND EXPENSIVE 
THIS EXCLUSIVE MATERIAL WAS USED TO CREATE A RAREFIED AND FANTASTICAL WORLD 
BUT THESE ARE NOT THE AMBER PANELS INSTALLED BY ELIZABETH 
THIS AMBER ROOM A PERFECT COPY IS LESS THAN TEN YEARS OLD 
THE PALACE WAS A VICTIM OF FIGHTING DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
WHEN GERMAN SOLDIERS RETREATED AFTER THE SIEGE OF LENINGRAD 
THE BUILDING WAS LEFT A RUIN 
BUT AFTER THE WAR IT BECAME AN ISSUE OF NATIONAL PRIDE 
TO RESTORE ELIZABETH'S VISION OF BEAUTY 
THE RESTORATION IS AMBITIOUS 
THE DESIGNS MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES ARE AUTHENTIC 
BUT DOES THE SPIRIT OF ELIZABETH'S LOST PALACE REALLY LIVE AGAIN 
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO RESTORE LOST BEAUTY 
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO RESTORE THE CATHERINE PALACE 
AND SO THE BEAUTY OF THE CATHERINE PALACE LIVES AGAIN 
THE EASTERN COAST OF INDIA 
WHERE THE BEAUTY OF THE HUMAN BODY CAN BE A SACRED THING 
I'VE COME TO SEE A TEMPLE WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT 
AND RICHLY ORNAMENTED IN INDIA 
WHICH HAS DOMINATED THIS COAST ON THE BAY OF BENGAL FOR CENTURIES 
BUT DESPITE THE TEMPLE'S ARCHITECTURAL WONDER 
IT'S PUZZLED SHOCKED AND APPALLED PEOPLE 
IT'S BEEN CALLED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BUILDING IN THE WORLD 
AND ALSO THE MOST OBSCENE 
WHAT'S CERTAIN THOUGH IS THAT IT'S A SENSATIONAL MONUMENT TO THE POWER OF SEX 
THE TEMPLE WAS ONCE POSITIONED RIGHT ON THE BEACH 
BUT OVER THE CENTURIES 
THE LAND BETWEEN THE OCEAN AND THE TEMPLE GREW 
AND IT'S NOW STRANDED INLAND IN THE SMALL TOWN OF KONARAK 
THE TEMPLE WAS BUILT IN THE MID THIRTEENTH CENTURY BY A LOCAL HINDU KING 
IT'S DEDICATED TO THE SUN GOD SURYA 
BUT THERE ARE MORE UNUSUAL SCULPTURES HERE 
THE WALLS ARE COVERED WITH BEAUTIFUL IMAGES 
OF PEOPLE IN THE MOST INTIMATE EMBRACE 
THIS BUILDING HAS MORE GRAPHIC SEX ACTS DEPICTED ON IT 
THAN ANY OTHER TEMPLE IN INDIA 
THE WHOLE TEMPLE'S CONCEIVED AS THE MIGHTY CHARIOT 
ON WHICH THE SUN GOD SURYA IS DRAWN THROUGH THE SKY 
FROM DAWN UNTIL DUSK AND NUMBER IS ALL IMPORTANT HERE 
THE CHARIOT'S FURNISHED WITH TWENTY FOUR MASSIVE WHEELS 
WHICH REPRESENT THE TWENTY FOUR BRIGHT AND DARK MOONS OF EACH YEAR 
THE CHARIOT'S DRAWN BY SEVEN PRANCING STEEDS 
SYMBOLISING OF COURSE THE SEVEN DAYS OF THE WEEK 
THE TEMPLE'S NOT JUST A CELESTIAL VEHICLE IT'S ALSO A TIME MACHINE 
OR RATHER A MAGIC MACHINE OUTSIDE TIME 
ROLLING THROUGH ETERNITY AND ALL IS ORGANISED AROUND THE SUN 
THE MAIN DOOR FACES EAST TOWARDS THE RISING SUN 
WHICH BRINGS NEW LIFE WITH EVERY DAWN 
AND AS THE SUN MOVES AROUND THE BUILDING 
IT BRINGS TO LIFE ENERGISES ALL THE SCULPTURE ON THE TEMPLE 
AH THIS IS THE DANCE HALL 
THIS IS WHERE THE DEVADASIS THE TEMPLE DANCING GIRLS 
WOULD HAVE PERFORMED AND YOU CAN SEE THEM HERE 
CARVED ONTO THE ARCHITECTURE DANCING 
THIS ONE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE WITH A DRUM A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT 
RIGHT HERE THEY DANCED IMAGINE IT 
ORIGINALLY THIS WAS A ROOFED STRUCTURE DARK MYSTERIOUS MAGICAL 
AND THE GIRLS DANCING TO PLEASE THE GOD AND TO PLEASE THE BRAHMIN PRIESTS 
THESE GIRLS HAD A HIGH STATUS JUST BELOW THAT OF THE PRIESTS THEMSELVES 
BUT THEY MAY HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE RITES PARTICULAR AND PECULIAR TO THIS TEMPLE 
FOR CENTURIES THE SEXUAL IMAGES HAVE CONFUSED AND ALARMED PEOPLE 
ONE BRITISH COMMISSIONER DURING THE RAJ DENOUNCED THEM AS BEASTLY 
AND SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THE WHOLE PLACE WAS LEVELLED TO THE GROUND 
TODAY THE TEMPLE'S SWARMING WITH INQUISITIVE TOURISTS 
AND SCHOOLCHILDREN WHO SEEM A LITTLE MORE RELAXED 
BUT WHAT'S THIS SEXUAL IMAGERY ALL ABOUT 
THE MEANING OF THIS BUILDING HAS LONG PUZZLED PEOPLE 
BUT I BELIEVE SOME OF THE ANSWERS MUST LIE IN THE HINDU FAITH ITSELF 
WHEN THE TEMPLE WAS BEING CONSTRUCTED 
TANTRIC PRACTICES WERE GAINING STRENGTH IN NORTHEAST INDIA 
AND IN TANTRA THE IDEA IS THAT POWER CAN BE OBTAINED FROM NATURE 
AND CONTACT MADE WITH THE DIVINE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE BODY 
SEX PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE 
SEXUAL BLISS IS SEEN AS AKIN TO THE JOY THE ECSTASY OF ENLIGHTENMENT 
OF UNION WITH THE GOD SO A BUILDING LIKE THIS FULL OF SEXUAL IMAGES 
ARE REALLY IMAGES TO DO WITH DIVINE PRACTICES 
SEX ORGASM IS SEEN AS OPENING A WINDOW ONTO THE DIVINE 
THE BELIEF THAT SEXUAL ACTIVITY COULD LEAD TO SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT 
WAS PARTICULAR TO THE MORE RADICAL SCHOOL OF TANTRIC THINKING 
WHICH CHALLENGED MOST ESTABLISHED HINDU CONVENTIONS 
SO THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED THESE IMAGES HAD VERY SPECIFIC BELIEFS 
THEY BELIEVED IN THE SACRED NATURE OF BODILY FLUIDS 
AND ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ALL OF THIS BEGINS TO MAKE SENSE 
THESE ARE NOT JUST IMAGES OF PEOPLE SEEKING GRATIFICATION 
BUT IMAGES OF PEOPLE FEASTING ON DIVINE NECTAR 
THE STUFF OF LIFE THE STUFF OF IMMORTALITY 
FLUID IS CENTRAL TO THE HINDU CREATION MYTH 
IN WHICH LIFE SPRINGS FROM AN OCEAN OF M. ILK 
AND DURING SEXUAL ACTIVITY THE BODILY FLUIDS UNITE TO CREATE LIFE 
THEY ARE THE NECTAR OF IMMORTALITY 
THE WAYS IN WHICH THIS NECTAR WAS EXTRACTED AND DISTRIBUTED 
CAN ONLY LEAVE YOU LOST IN WONDER SUCH INVENTION SUCH GYMNASTICS 
SOME OF IT LOOKS REALLY HARD WORK 
HERE A WOMAN'S PRESENTING CERTAIN BODILY FLUIDS TO AN ALTAR 
ON WHICH BURNS A SACRED FLAME 
SUCH FLUIDS WERE VITAL OFFERINGS TO TANTRIC DEITIES 
AND ANIMALS WHICH ACCORDING TO HINDU BELIEF 
CONTAIN A SOUL ON A JOURNEY WERE NOT LEFT OUT 
HERE A THOUGHTFUL YOUNG LADY IS GIVING A DOG I BELIEVE 
A DIVINE MEAL 
THE FINAL MYSTERY OF THE SUN TEMPLE IS ITS END 
AFTER BEING A PLACE OF WORSHIP FOR MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS 
IT WAS ABANDONED 
ALREADY BY THE EARLY SEVENTEENTH CENTURY IT WAS A DESOLATE RUIN 
HALF BURIED IN THE SAND 
AND THE INTERIOR NOW IS SIMPLY FULL OF STONE 
WHY THIS HAPPENED WE DO NOT KNOW 
PERHAPS IT WAS A CYCLONE IN THE PAST THAT DAMAGED THE BUILDING 
MADE IT NO LONGER AUSPICIOUS FOR THE GOD 
PERHAPS LOCAL PEOPLE TURNED AGAINST IT 
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE GREAT KALASH 
THE GREAT POT ON THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID 
THAT SYMBOLICALLY CONTAINED AMBROSIA 
THE STUFF OF IMMORTALITY THAT POT HAS LONG GONE 
THIS TEMPLE IS NOW AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE 
IT'S A SLUMBERING GIANT 
THE SPIRITUAL POWER OF THE PLACE HAS BEEN REDUCED 
BUT IT'S FAR FROM LOST 
PEOPLE FLOCK HERE TO WONDER AT THE ARCHITECTURE AND THE SCULPTURE 
TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND THE TEMPLE'S MYSTERIES AND SECRETS 
WHAT THEY MAKE OF IT OF COURSE DEPENDS ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL NATURES 
TO THE PURE ALL IS PURE 
TO THOSE OF EVIL INTENTIONS ALL IS EVIL 
I SEE THE TEMPLE AS A GREAT TEMPLE OF JOY 
A TEMPLE TO THE POWER OF SEX 
THE TOWN OF ALBI IN THE HISTORIC REGION OF LANGUEDOC 
IT'S NOW THE PERFECT IMAGE OF A PEACEFUL FRENCH TOWN 
BUT IN THE MIDDLE AGES IT WASN'T PART OF FRANCE 
IT WAS A PLACE OF PERSECUTION AND TERROR 
FROM WHICH EMERGED A VISION OF POWERFUL SINISTER BEAUTY 
THIS IS ALBI CATHEDRAL 
PART HOUSE OF PRAYER PART FORTRESS 
IT WAS BEGUN IN THE LATE THIRTEENTH CENTURY BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
TO OPPRESS THE LOCAL POPULATION AND TERRIFY IT INTO SUBMISSION 
EVEN TODAY THE CATHEDRAL'S SCALE AND BROODING PRESENCE 
INSTILS AWE AND ASTONISHMENT 
THE BUILDING'S BOLD FUNCTIONAL FORMS 
GIVE IT AN ABSTRACT SCULPTURAL POETIC POWER 
AND THE MELLOW RED BRICKS ARE ABSOLUTELY SENSATIONAL 
ALBI WAS AT THE HEART OF ONE OF THE MIDDLE AGES' MOST SAVAGE CRUSADES 
AS CATHOLIC FORCES FROM NORTHERN FRANCE 
SOUGHT TO VANQUISH THE PEOPLE OF LANGUEDOC 
THE TOWN HAD EMBRACED THE CATHAR RELIGION 
WHICH BRANDED THE CHURCH OF ROME MATERIALISTIC AND SATANIC 
IN TURN THE POPE DECLARED THEM HERETICS 
AND A CATHEDRAL WAS BUILT TO SUPPRESS THE CATHAR RELIGION FOR EVER 
THE CATHEDRAL'S ALL ABOUT POWER WORLDLY POWER RATHER THAN SPIRITUAL 
IT'S A FORTRESS OF COURSE 
THE WALLS ARE INCREDIBLY THICK AT THEIR BASE 
TO STOP THEM BEING PIERCED BY BATTERING RAMS 
AND THE WINDOWS ARE HIGH AND NARROW 
SO THEY CAN'T BE ENTERED BY INTRUDERS 
THE INTERIOR'S NOW RICHLY DECORATED BUT ALL OF THIS IS LATER 
WHEN NEW THE INTERIOR WOULD HAVE BEEN GAUNT VAST SUBLIME 
RATHER INTIMIDATING I SHOULD THINK 
QUITE WHAT THE PEOPLE OF ALBI THOUGH ABOUT THIS INTERIOR IT'S HARD TO KNOW 
BUT SURELY THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED BY ITS VAST SCALE 
BY ITS BOLD SIMPLICITY BY ITS TERRIBLE BEAUTY 
IN A TRIUMPH OF MILITARY ENGINEERING 
ALBI'S HUGE WEIGHT IS CARRIED ON MASSIVE BUTTRESSES 
SET BETWEEN THE WINDOWS PROJECTING INTO THE BUILDING 
AND PIERCED ONLY BY A SERIES OF SMALL DOORWAYS 
HERE DEFENCE WAS ALL IMPORTANT 
THE OUTER WALLS ARE INCREDIBLY THICK AND STRONG TO KEEP OUT ATTACKERS 
AND THE BUTTRESSES USUALLY OUTSIDE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INSIDE 
AND HERE'S ONE OF THEM A MASSIVE PIECE OF CONSTRUCTION 
THESE BUTTRESSES HOLD UP MUCH OF THE VAULT ABOVE THE NAVE 
THE THINKING WAS IF THESE WERE OUTSIDE 
THEY COULD BE DEMOLISHED BY ATTACKERS AND THE WHOLE BUILDING WOULD COME TUMBLING DOWN 
THE CATHEDRAL HAS AN INCREDIBLY COMMANDING VIEW OVER THE TOWN 
THE RIVER AND THE SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE 
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY CASTLE LIKE ORIGINALLY 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE A GREAT CASTLE TOWER A KEEP 
BECAUSE DOWN THERE WERE WALLS AND TOWERS 
AND EVEN A GATEHOUSE WITH A DRAWBRIDGE ALL DEFENDING IT 
WHOEVER RULED THE CATHEDRAL RULED THIS LAND 
AS THE CATHEDRAL GREW TALL THE CHURCH LAUNCHED AN INQUISITION 
FORCING PEOPLE TO DECLARE THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO THE POPE OR BE EXECUTED 
BY THE EARLY FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
THE PERSECUTION OF CATHARS REACHED VIOLENT EXTREMES 
THE INQUISITION'S GRIP ON THE TOWN WAS NOW ABSOLUTE 
THE BODIES OF ALLEGED HERETICS WERE DUG UP DEFILED BURNT 
JUST TO LET THE PEOPLE HERE KNOW ABOUT THE PERILS OF DISOBEDIENCE 
TO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 
AND THEN THERE WAS THE PRESENCE OF THE CATHEDRAL 
A PERPETUAL REMINDER OF WHO WAS IN CONTROL 
THE CATHEDRAL CONTINUED TO EXPAND 
LONG AFTER THE INQUISITION HAD CRUSHED THE SPIRIT OF THE CATHARS 
BUT ONE PIECE OF DECORATION IS A REMINDER OF THE SAVAGE BEAUTY 
AT THE HEART OF ALBI CATHEDRAL 
NO DOUBT AS A FRIGHTFUL WARNING TO THE COMMUNITY 
THIS ASTONISHING PAINTING WAS UNVEILED IN THE ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTIES 
IT SHOWS THE JUDGMENT THAT CHRISTIANS BELIEVE WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE END OF TIME 
WHEN THE DEAD RISE UP FROM THEIR GRAVES 
AND ARE JUDGED AND CONSIGNED TO HEAVEN OR TO HELL 
THIS PAINTING IS AMAZING BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SHOW ANY OF THE PROMISES 
OF PARADISE SIMPLY THE TORMENTS THE SUFFERING OF THE DAMNED IN HELL 
AMAZING SCENES ARE BEING ENACTED HERE 
PEOPLE ARE BEING BROKEN ON THE WHEEL 
OTHER PEOPLE ARE BEING BOILED IN CAULDRONS 
AND ONE WOMAN IS BEING FORCED TO SWALLOW SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY HORRID 
IT LOOKS LIKE A SNAKE OTHERS ARE BEING SICK 
WHAT PEOPLE HERE MADE OF THIS I REALLY CANNOT IMAGINE 
THOUGH OF COURSE ANY CATHARS LINGERING IN THE COMMUNITY 
THIS WAS MEANT FOR THEM WASN'T IT 
IT WAS TO TELL THEM THIS IS THE FATE AWAITING THEM 
IF THEY DO NOT SURRENDER TO THE WILL OF THE CHURCH IN ROME 
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST INTRIGUING PERPLEXING AND FOR ME 
MOST ARCHITECTURALLY EXCITING BUILDINGS IN THE WORLD 
IT WAS CREATED TO OPPRESS AND TERRIFY PEOPLE YET IN ITS DESIGN 
THERE'S A PURITY A BOLD SIMPLICITY 
A CLARITY THAT LEADS TO BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT MOVES MY SOUL 
SO HERE WE CAN SEE GOOD COMING OUT OF EVIL 
AND MEAN INTENTIONS LEADING TO A MASTERPIECE 
I WANT YOU BACK BY THE JACKSON FIVE 
WHEN I AD YOU TO MYSELF 
I DIDN'T WANT YOU AROUND 
THOSE PRETTY FACES ALWAYS MADE YA 
STAND OUT IN THE CROWD 
THEN SOMEONE PICKED YOU FROM THE BUNCH 
ONE GLANCE WAS ALL IT TOOK 
NOW IT'S MUCH TOO LATE FOR ME 
TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK 
OH DARLIN' I WAS BLIND TO LET YOU GO 
BUT NOW SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU IN HER ARMS I WANT YOU BACK 
INTRODUCING THE JACKSON FIVE
