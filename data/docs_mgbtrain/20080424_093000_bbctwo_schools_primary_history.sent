HI I'M ALEX 
I'M SCOTTISH AND I'M GREEK TOO 
BUT I WASN'T ALWAYS PROUD OF THAT 
A WHILE AGO I STARTED TO LEARN ABOUT ALL THE THINGS 
THAT THE GREEKS HAD GIVEN US 
NO THEY DIDN'T GIVE US TALENT CONTESTS 
BUT THEY WERE GREAT STORYTELLERS 
ALEX YOU'RE NEXT 
GOOD LUCK POPPADOM 
THIS IS ALEXANDER PAPADOPOULOS AND HE'S GOING TO 
OH TELL US A STORY 
THAT'S UNUSUAL BUT OFF YOU GO 
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A BOY CALLED ALEX AND HE HATED THIS GIRL CALLED HELEN 
AND SO EVERY DAY HE'D THINK UP WAYS OF GETTING BACK AT HER 
FOR ALL THE AWFUL THINGS SHE DID TO HIM 
LIKE THROWING THINGS AT HIM AND CALLING HIM NAMES 
SO ONE DAY HE DECIDED TO SNEAK INTO HER BIN 
WHEN SHE WAS AT NETBALL SO THAT'S WHAT HE DID 
AND WHEN HELEN BROUGHT HER BIN IN THAT NIGHT AFTER NETBALL 
ALEX JUMPED OUT AND SCARED HER THE END 
YOU DIDN'T GET A SECOND AUDITION 
NO RHONA SAID MY STORY WAS PRETTY MUCH 
THE WORST ONE SHE'D EVER HEARD 
YOU USE ANY PROPS ANY WHAT 
WHAT ABOUT MUSIC 
NO IT'S A STORY AND IT'S OVER WITH 
WHAT A GREEK BOY DOESN'T GIVE UP 
YOU TRY HARDER MAKE IT PERFECT REMEMBER LOOK IN THE BOOK 
NO PAPOU NOT THIS AGAIN HONESTLY 
WHAT HAVE THE ANCIENT GREEKS GOT TO DO WITH MY STORY 
WHAT HAVE THE ANCIENT GREEKS GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING 
WHAT HAVE THE GREEKS GOT TO DO WITH STORYTELLING 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE ANCIENT GREEKS INVENTED STORYTELLING 
THEY CREATED PLAYS AND THEY MADE THEM INTERESTING TO LOOK AT 
MOST OF THEIR STORIES WERE BASED UPON MYTHS 
A MYTH IS A STORY ABOUT THE GODS 
AND A MYTH TEACHES YOU TO BE A GOOD PERSON 
YOU EVER HEAR THE ONE ABOUT ORPHEUS 
THE GODS HAD A POSTIE O. K. A MESSENGER CALLED HERMES 
WHEN HE WAS A BABY HERMES INVENTED AN INSTRUMENT THE LYRE 
USING COW GUTS AND A TORTOISE SHELL LOVELY 
HOWEVER THE COW BELONGED TO HIS BROTHER APOLLO 
AND HE HAD TO HAND THE LYRE OVER TO APOLLO AS PUNISHMENT 
APOLLO THEN GAVE IT TO HIS BOY ORPHEUS 
AND WO HO HO COULD HE PLAY 
HE COULD CALM MONSTERS WILD ANIMALS TREES 
WHAT HE COULDN'T CALM WAS A BUNCH OF WILD WOMEN 
WHO RIPPED HIM APART WITH THEIR BARE HANDS 
DIDN'T STOP HIM SINGING THOUGH 
WHAT DOES THAT STORY TEACH US NOT TO PLAY THE LYRE 
NOT TO KILL SOMEBODY ELSE'S COW MAYBE 
WHO CARES ANYWAY MY STORY'S NOT A MYTH 
NO BUT IT KIND OF REMINDS ME OF A FAMOUS OLD GREEK STORY 
HERE HAVE A LOOK IN HERE 
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND WHICH ONE YOUR STORY IS LIKE 
AND SEE IF IT GIVES YOU ANY IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE YOURS BETTER 
ONE TWO THREE AND ONE TWO THREE 
THAT'S HELEN AND HER COUSINS 
THEY GOT A SECOND AUDITION 
ANNA MARIA YOU'RE OUT OF STEP 
SO WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE ANCIENT GREEKS AND ENTERTAINMENT 
THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND 
AH WHO ARE YOU HANG ON YOU'RE SOPHOCLES 
THE FAMOUS GREEK PLAYWRIGHT WRONG 
I'M AESCHYLUS 
THE BEST GREEK PLAYWRIGHT 
WHAT'S THAT NOTHING 
SNUCK INTO HER GARDEN WHILE SHE WAS AT NETBALL 
HA HA BLAH BLAH 
JUMPED OUT AND SCARED HER HA HA HA 
WHAT WHAT'S SO FUNNY 
THIS ISN'T A COMEDY 
HMPH YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN 
YOU KNOW WE GREEKS PRACTICALLY INVENTED COMEDY 
GOOD TIMING GREAT JOKES NICE AND BRIGHT 
AND WHEN WE DID TRAGEDY WE MADE IT REALLY SAD AND HOPELESS AND DARK 
BUT YOUR STORY WELL 
IT'S NEITHER COMEDY OR TRAGEDY 
IT HAS NO TENSION NO EXCITEMENT 
PLUS IT'S NOT VERY ORIGINAL 
IT'S JUST LIKE A FAMOUS GREEK STORY 
LOOK IN THE BOOK 
THE STORY OF THE TROJAN HORSE 
NOW THE GREEKS WERE AT WAR WITH THE TROJANS 
BUT THEY COULDN'T GET INSIDE THE WALLS 
NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY TRIED 
SO THEY MADE A BIG PRETEND HORSE AND SOME OF THEM HID INSIDE 
AND THE TROJANS CAME OUT AND WHEELED THE HORSE 
INTO THE CITY AND WHAM BANGO WHAM BANGO 
HEY PRESTO THEN THE SOLDIERS GOT OUT AND SCARED THEM 
WELL THEY KILLED THEM ACTUALLY 
BUT MY STORY ISN'T LIKE THAT 
NEARLY THE SAME 
HIDING HER WHEELING YOU IN 
GETTING REVENGE IT'S THE SAME MORAL 
MORAL 
EVERY GOOD STORY HAS ONE 
IT'S THE TRUTH SOMETHING YOU LEARN TO MAKE YOU LIVE BETTER 
WHAT'S THE MORAL OF MY STORY 
IS IT THE SAME AS THE HORSE ONE 
THAT OUT FOR YOURSELF 
ANYWAY IT'S NOT YOUR STORY SO MUCH THAT'S THE TROUBLE 
IT'S THE WAY YOU SAY IT 
ONCE UPON A TIME NO 
PRETEND YOU'RE AT THE ORCHESTRA 
PLAYING THE VIOLIN 
NO THE ORCHESTRA IS LOOK INSIDE 
PART OF THE THEATRE 
THERE WAS COMEDY 
AND THERE WAS TRAGEDY 
BUT IF THE AUDIENCE DIDN'T LIKE WHAT THEY SAW 
THEN THERE WAS TROUBLE 
LUCKILY THOUGH THE THEATRE STAFF COULD HIT YOU WITH A BIG STICK 
IF YOU GOT TOO ROWDY 
WHICH IS A LOT HANDIER THAN A TORCH 
AS ANY CINEMA USHER WILL TELL YOU 
ANYWAY THE ORCHESTRA WAS SPECTACULAR 
A CIRCLE CUT INTO THE HILLSIDE 
IMAGINE STONE SEATS FOR THE IMPORTANT PEOPLE AT THE FRONT 
AND AT THE BACK FLOCKS OF PEOPLE ALL WATCHING YOU 
AND YOU AT THE FRONT GETTING READY TO PERFORM YOUR STORY 
YOU HAD TO BE VERY GOOD YOU KNOW 
SO YOU TRY AGAIN 
ADD AN INTERESTING VOICE 
ONCE UPON A TIME GOOD BETTER 
THAT'S YOU ACTING NOW MAKING YOUR STORY GRIPPING INTERESTING 
THAT'S HOW PLAYS DEVELOPED 
FROM STORIES BEING TOLD IN AN INTERESTING WAY 
AND IF YOU WANT TO BE MORE THAN ONE PERSON LIKE HELEN SAY 
THEN PUT ON A MASK A HELEN MASK 
SHE'S MEAN SHE'S TRAGIC SO PUT ON A DARK TRAGEDY MASK 
I'M HELEN AND I'M NASTY AND HORRIBLE AND UGLY 
NOW TAKE IT OFF AND YOU ARE YOU AGAIN 
THAT WAY YOU CAN BE MORE THAN ONE CHARACTER 
NOW LET'S SEE 
AH YES YOU NEED A CHORUS 
A CHORUS LIKE WHO PUT THE DOGS OUT WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF 
NO NO A CHORUS IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE 
WHO STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAGE 
AND TALK TO THE AUDIENCE AND DANCE 
THEY HELP THE AUDIENCE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON 
A BIT LIKE A HELP BUTTON ON A COMPUTER GAME 
SO A CHORUS GIVES THE AUDIENCE SOME INSIDE INFORMATION RIGHT 
AND AT THE END WHEN YOU HIDE USE A PROP A WHAT 
TO MAKE THE STAGE MORE INTERESTING TO LOOK AT 
NOBODY USED THEM BEFORE US GREEKS YOU KNOW 
ANYWAY I HAVE TO GO 
YOU DO THE REST YOURSELF 
DON'T FORGET THE MORAL 
THE MORAL THE MORAL 
WHAT'S THE MORAL 
I'M MEAN AND I'M UGLY 
PAPOU COULD YOU HELP ME GET A SECOND AUDITION SURE 
AND I NEED YOU TO BE MY CHORUS 
W. H. WHAT 
YEP THOSE GREEK PLAYS REALLY HAD SOMETHING 
CAN YOU WORK OUT THE MORAL OF THIS ONE 
THERE WAS ONCE A KING OF PHRYGIA 
OOH I LIKE LIMERICKS GO ON 
IT'S NOT A LIMERICK IT'S A FABLE 
AHEM THERE ONCE WAS A KING CALLED MIDAS 
WHOSE SCHEMES NEVER FAILED TO SURPRISE US 
HIS FOLLIES WERE ENDLESS SO HEAVEN DEFEND US 
FROM FOOLS OF THE LIKE OF KING MIDAS 
HEY WHO ARE YOU CALLING A FOOL 
WELL YOU HAVE A PEACEFUL KINGDOM A BEAUTIFUL WIFE 
A DEVOTED LITTLE SON ENOUGH TO EAT 
THAT'S NOT FOOLISH THAT 
IS HUMAN NATURE 
NOW THERE'S A FOOL IF WE'RE TALKING FOOLS 
YESTERDAY HE DRANK TWO FLAGONS OF WINE 
AND TODAY HE CAN'T EVEN TELL HIS HOOF FROM HIS HELBOW 
CAN'T EVEN FIND HIS WAY OUT OF MY GARDEN 
COME ALONG SILENUS LEAN ON ME 
I'LL POINT YOU IN THE DIRECTION OF OLYMPUS 
THIS PATH WILL TAKE YOU RIGHT HOME

BEING RICH MAKES ME HUNGRY AH CHIME 
OW OW I BROKE MY TOOTH

CHIME 
SUDDENLY MIDAS WAS RAVENOUS AND THIRSTY AS SAND 
HE TRIED EVERY WAY TO OUTWIT HIS WISH 
FROM HEAD TO FOOT HE HAD BEEN TARRED AND FEATHERED IN MAGIC 
WHEN HE WALKED THROUGH HIS GARDENS NOW 
THE FLOWER HEADS BANGED ABOUT HIS KNEES 
THEIR STIFF STEMS PRODDED HIM 
HIS CLOTHES CLANGED AROUND HIM LIKE A BELL AROUND ITS CLAPPER 
WELL DO SOMETHING CAN YOU CHIME 
OH ZEUS WHAT HAVE I DONE 
FATHER FATHER HAVE YOU SEEN THE HORSES 
NO SON DON'T COME NEAR ME 
THE STABLE DOORS ARE ALL GOLDEN NO SON NO NO 
CHIME NO O. O. O 
OH ZEUS SILENUS 
I TAKE IT BACK 
FORGIVE ME I DON'T WANT IT 
TAKE BACK YOUR GIFT 
SO YOU WISH YOUR WISH UNWISHED DO YOU MIDAS 
OH YES YES HE CALLED YOU A FOOL SILENUS 
THIS MAN WITH THE GOLDEN TOUCH 
THIS MAN IN HIS METAL PALACE 
WITH A GARDEN FULL OF METAL FLOWERS 
HE CALLED YOU A FOOL 
I'M SORRY 
I AM THE WORLD'S GREATEST FOOL 
I KNOW IT BUT I'VE LEARNED 
I PROMISE I WILL NEVER BE AS STUPID AGAIN IF YOU WILL ONLY 
THEN GO AND WASH YOURSELF IN THE RIVER 
YOUR GOLDEN SERVANTS TOO 
YOUR GOLDEN HORSES 
THE GOLDEN APPLE OF YOUR EYE 
AND DON'T FORGET TO WASH BEHIND YOUR EARS 
A PROPER FOOL THAT ONE 
AN EIGHTEEN CARAT FOOL 
A HALLMARKED MINT CONDITIONED 
GILT EDGED COPPER BOTTOMED FOOL 
THE CROWN KING OF FOOLS 
AND THE MORAL YOU'RE RIGHT 
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR 
IT WAS THE DAY OF THE SECOND AUDITIONS 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE POPPADOM 
I TOLD YOU IT'S TOO LATE 
THERE'S A FREE MEAL IN IT 
FOUR COURSES 
FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY 
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A GIRL NAMED HELEN 
HER FACE WAS COVERED WITH WARTS AND SORES THAT OOZED PUS 
MY NAME IT IS HELEN MY AIM NOT TO PLEASE 
MY NAME IT IS HELEN I HAVE AND I TEASE 
HELEN USED TO TEASE ALEX ALL THE TIME 
YOU STUPID GREASE BALL EVERY MORNING YOU FALL 
YOU SILLY WEE FOOL WITH A FACE LIKE A GHOUL 
SO THAT NIGHT WHEN HELEN WAS IN HER GARDEN 
EATING JUNK FOOD BELCHING AND NOT SAYING PARDON 
HE THOUGHT UP A PLAN CUNNING AND CLEVER 
TO MAKE HER STOP TEASING HIM FOREVER 
WHERE YOU BIN NOWHERE 
WHERE YOU WHEELIE BIN NOWHERE 
NO I MEAN WHERE IS YOUR WHEELIE BIN 
OH IT'S OVER THERE 
MY NAME IS HELEN I'M EVIL TO BE SURE 
I LIKE TO EAT WORMS AND THEN TO EAT MORE 
I LIKE TO BE AWFUL TO BOYS WHO ARE SAD 
WHERE IS HE THAT BRAT I NEED TO BE BAD 
ALEXANDER WHERE ARE YOU AHA 
AND SO NASTY HELEN RAN FAR FAR AWAY 
AND ONLY CAME BACK WHEN SHE WAS READY TO SAY 
I'M SORRY MY FRIEND FOR BEING SO MEAN 
LET'S DANCE TOGETHER LET OUR FRIENDSHIP BE SEEN 
SO WHAT MY FRIENDS IS THE MORAL OF THIS STORY THE WHAT 
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED ABOUT HOW TO BEHAVE DON'T WEAR MASKS 
NEVER OPEN WHEELIE BINS IN THE DARK 
IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE AND EASY TO FIND 
IF YOU'RE MEAN AND NASTY AND ALWAYS UNKIND 
IF YOU'VE SPENT ALL YOUR TIME MAKING OTHERS FEEL BAD 
THEN YOU'LL LOSE ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND FEEL LONELY AND SAD 
EQUAL FIRST WELL DONE 
ER THANKS 
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE SOME WORMS 
MAYBE SHE WASN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL 
AND THAT'S HOW I FOUND OUT WHY PAPOU IS SUCH A GOOD STORYTELLER 
HE GOT IT FROM THE GREEKS AND NOW I'M LEARNING IT TOO
