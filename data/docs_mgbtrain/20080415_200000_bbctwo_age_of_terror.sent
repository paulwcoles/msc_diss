THIS IS THE BLOODY HISTORY OF FORTY YEARS OF TERROR 
THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE 
WHEN I STARTED OUT AS A GREEN YOUNG REPORTER IN THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
I'D HARDLY EVER HEARD THE WORD TERRORISM 
HOLY FUCK 
TODAY WE ARE ALL POTENTIAL TARGETS 
OVER THE YEARS I'VE SEEN CHANGES IN THE CAUSES OF TERROR 
AND CHANGES IN THE WAY IT'S CARRIED OUT 
TODAY WE FEAR THE ISLAMIST SUICIDE BOMBER 
WE ARE AT WAR AND I'M A SOLDIER 
BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WE FEARED THE REVOLUTIONARY HIJACKER 
WE ARE GOING TO EXECUTE ALL THE PASSENGERS 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AN AIR FRANCE FLIGHT FROM TEL AVIV TO PARIS 
WAS STORMED BY FOUR HIJACKERS 
AT FIRST IT LOOKED LIKE A CLASSIC TERRORIST OPERATION 
BUT THIS WAS VERY DIFFERENT 
THE HIJACKERS FLEW THEIR HOSTAGES TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILES 
TO UGANDA'S ENTEBBE AIRPORT 
AND INTO A PERFECT STORM OF VIOLENCE 
AFRICA WA YAY 
REVENGE AND HEROISM 
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THOSE SIX DAYS AT ENTEBBE 
TRANSFORMED THE AGE OF TERROR 
IT NEVER HAPPENS TO YOU IT'S ALWAYS SOMEONE ELSE 
AND YOU NOD ANXIOUSLY THINKING 
IT'S TERRIBLE THAT TERROR RULES THE WORLD 
THEN YOU SIP YOUR COFFEE AND GO ABOUT YOUR DAILY AFFAIRS 
THIS IS THE C. B. S. SUNDAY NIGHT NEWS WITH MORTON DEAN 
GOOD EVENING 
AN AIR FRANCE JET WAS HIJACKED BY PALESTINIAN GUERRILLAS TODAY 
TWO MEN RAN FROM THE BACK OF THE PLANE AND THEY HAD HAND GRENADES 
AND THEY WERE JUST SHOUTING AND SHOUTING 
ON BOARD NINE AMERICANS SOME EIGHTY ISRAELIS AND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN OTHER PASSENGERS 
THE FIRST THING THAT I REALLY RECALL IS THE BLUE EYES OF MY TWO SONS 
AND THEY BOTH LOOK UP AS IF SAYING OH GOD WHY IT HAPPEN TO US 
ALL HELL BROKE THROUGH IN THE PLANE 
IT WAS VERY NOISY PEOPLE WERE RUNNING BACK AND FORTH 
SO I UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING VERY BAD IS HAPPENING 
AN HOUR AFTER THE HIJACKING ISRAELI AIR CONTROLLERS REALISED 
THE PLANE HAD DRAMATICALLY CHANGED ITS COURSE 
A DUTY OFFICER BURST INTO THE ROOM 
SHOUTING MUKI THERE'S BEEN A HIJACKING 
AN AIR FRANCE PLANE HAS BEEN HIJACKED FROM BEN GURION AIRPORT 
ISRAEL'S PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN WAS CONFRONTED WITH AN AGONISING DILEMMA 
HIS GOVERNMENT HAD AN IRON POLICY NEVER TO NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS 
RABIN'S ONLY ALTERNATIVE WAS TO AUTHORISE A RESCUE MISSION 
A MISSION HE KNEW MIGHT END IN THE SLAUGHTER OF THE HOSTAGES 
AND THE DETAILS OF THIS HIJACKING WERE STILL UNCLEAR 
HOW MANY HIJACKERS WERE THERE HOW WELL ARMED 
AND WHAT WERE THEIR DEMANDS 
THE JET WAS GOING FROM TEL AVIV TO PARIS WITH A STOP IN ATHENS 
THAT'S WHERE THE HIJACKERS APPARENTLY BOARDED THE PLANE 
AND SHORTLY AFTER TAKE OFF ORDERED IT TO LAND AT BENGHAZI LIBYA 
WHILE IN LIBYA ONE OF THE HOSTAGES A NURSE FROM MANCHESTER MADE A DRAMATIC DECISION 
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF I'M NOT DOING THIS 
I'M GETTING OFF THIS PLANE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER 
AND FROM THAT SECOND I WASN'T SCARED ANY MORE 
BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS GONNA DO IT 
THE OBVIOUS CHOICE WAS TO USE A MEDICAL CONDITION 
I DECIDED I COULD BE PREGNANT AND HAVE A THREATENED MISCARRIAGE 
TRICIA MARTEL'S FEIGNED MISCARRIAGE WORKED 
AND SHE WALKED FREE FROM THE PLANE 
ONE HOSTAGE WAS NOW RELEASED 
BUT OVER TWO HUNDRED REMAINED PRISONERS OF THE HIJACKERS 
IN TEL AVIV THE ISRAELI DEFENCE FORCE THE I. D. F. 
WAS PUT ON HIGH ALERT 
RABIN'S GOVERNMENT KNEW THAT PREVIOUS HIJACKS 
HAD ENDED IN BLOODY SHOOT OUTS AT ISRAELI AIRPORTS 
HE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE NO EXCEPTION 
BUT THEN CAME THE NEWS THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING 
AIR FRANCE FLIGHT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE WAS IN THE AIR AGAIN 
AND FLYING FAR AWAY FROM ISRAEL 
DEEP INTO THE HEART OF AFRICA 
WE HAD LANDED IN UGANDA AT THREE FIFTEEN IN THE MORNING IT WAS NOW TEN 
THE CAPTAIN WAS IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS SAYING THAT FOR MOST OF US 
THIS MUST BE OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT UGANDA 
UGANDA WA YAY 
WA YAY 
AFRICA WA YAY 
UGANDA WAS THE FIEFDOM OF ONE OF AFRICA'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL LEADERS 
HE WAS FLAMBOYANT RUTHLESS AND QUITE POSSIBLY MAD 
IDI AMIN DADA 
AFRICA MUST SPEAK FOR AFRICA 
AND HE WAS WAITING TO WELCOME HIS UNFORTUNATE VISITORS 
HE WAS FIELD MARSHALL IDI AMIN DADA HIS MAJESTY 
HE WAS SO HUGE 
BIG FACE BIG HEAD BIG HANDS 
EVERYTHING WAS SO BIG 
AND WITH ALL THIS UNIFORM ON HIM IT EVEN MADE HIM MORE FRIGHTENING 
HE WAS TRYING TO SPREAD HIS SMILES AND TO TELL US HOW HE LOVES ISRAEL 
FOR SOME YEARS AMIN AND ISRAEL HAD BEEN FRIENDS 
THE ISRAELIS HAD EVEN TRAINED HIS MILITARY 
DID YOU EVER MEET AMIN I DID 
I DID MEET HIM ONCE 
WHAT WAS HE LIKE 
HE WAS DRUNK 
HE WAS HOLDING A BOTTLE OF JOHNNIE WALKER I BELIEVE 
AND HE WAS DRINKING FROM THE BOTTLE SO HE WAS HAPPY 
SO WHEN AMIN SWAGGERED INTO THE HOSTAGES' LIFE 
WITH EXTRAVAGANT PROMISES THAT HE'D SECURE THEIR RELEASE 
MANY OF THEM BELIEVED HE WAS THEIR TICKET TO FREEDOM 
BUT THIRTEEN YEAR OLD HOSTAGE BENNY DAVIDSON WAS LESS CONVINCED 
I REMEMBER SPECIFICALLY THAT HE USED COUPLE OF TIMES THE WORD DEADLINE 
WHILE TALKING TO US AND I WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED BY IT 
I UNDERSTOOD ENGLISH AND DEADLINE MEANS DEADLINE 
THERE IS A REASON WHY A DEADLINE'S CALLED A DEADLINE 
IN THE ENTEBBE TERMINAL THE HOSTAGES WERE NOW PAWNS 
IN A LIFE AND DEATH POLITICAL GAME 
BUT THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY WAS NOW ARRIVING HOME 
WHEN TRICIA MARTEL LANDED IN LONDON 
SHE WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE ISRAEL'S SECRET INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
THE MOSSAD WITH VITAL INFORMATION 
SHE TOLD THEM ABOUT THE HIJACKERS 
THERE WERE TWO ARABS WHO ANNOUNCED THEY WERE FROM 
THE POPULAR FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE THE P. F. L. P. 
AND THERE WERE TWO GERMANS A MAN AND A WOMAN 
ALL WERE HEAVILY ARMED 
THE HIJACKING SEEMED TO BE THE WORK OF A NETWORK OF REVOLUTIONARY GROUPS 
KNOWN AS TERROR INTERNATIONAL 
EIGHT ARAB GUERRILLAS HELD NINE ISRAELIS HOSTAGE 
WHEN I FIRST BEGAN REPORTING TERRORISM IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
THE BLOODY IMPRINT OF TERROR INTERNATIONAL IN ITS VARIOUS GUISES 
SEEMED TO BE EVERYWHERE 
THEY MASSACRED ISRAELI ATHLETES AT THE MUNICH OLYMPICS 
BLEW UP HIJACKED PLANES IN JORDAN 
KIDNAPPED OIL MINISTERS AT OPEC 
AND SLAUGHTERED TOURISTS AT AIRPORTS IN ROME AND TEL AVIV 
BUT ITS REAL SPECIALITY 
WAS HIJACKING PLANES AND TAKING HOSTAGES 
TRADING INNOCENT LIVES 
FOR THE FREEDOM OF THEIR JAILED COMRADES 
THIS WAS THE HALLMARK OF THE FIRST DECADE OF THE AGE OF TERROR 
MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH SOMEONE 
WHO SHARED THE REVOLUTIONARY FERVOUR OF TERROR INTERNATIONAL 
WAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE IN A CALIFORNIA JAIL 
HER NAME WAS ANGELA DAVIS 
PRESIDENT NIXON BRANDED HER A TERRORIST 
I WILL NOT BE FREE UNTIL ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE FREE 
SHE WAS LINKED TO THE BLACK PANTHERS A RADICAL GROUP 
WHOM THE F. B. I. CALLED THE GREATEST THREAT TO THE INTERNAL SECURITY OF AMERICA 
THE WORLD LOOKED VERY DIFFERENT THEN 
AND SO DID I 
DO REVOLUTIONARIES LIKE YOURSELF HAVE TO DIE 
ANGELA DAVIS WAS PREPARED TO DIE IN THE STRUGGLE TO LIBERATE BLACK AMERICA 
THE FOUR HIJACKERS IN ENTEBBE WERE DRIVEN BY THE SAME BURNING COMMITMENT 
THEIR COMMON CAUSE WAS THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE 
THEIR COMMON ENEMY ISRAEL 
THE TWO GERMAN HIJACKERS WILFRIED BOESE AND BRIGITTE KUHLMANN 
WERE MEMBERS OF A TINY GROUP CALLED REVOLUTIONARY CELLS 
THEY AND THE TWO PALESTINIAN HIJACKERS WERE JOINED ON THE GROUND AT ENTEBBE 
BY THE LEADERS OF THE OPERATION 
JA'IL EL ARJA AND FAYEZ JABER 
NOW THE HIJACKERS MADE THEIR DEMANDS 
FIFTY THREE PRISONERS MUST BE RELEASED INCLUDING FORTY PALESTINIANS IN ISRAEL 
AND SIX COMRADES OF BOESE AND KUHLMANN IN GERMANY 
A DEADLINE WAS SET TWO P. M. THURSDAY 
THREE DAYS AWAY 
IDI AMIN SAID THERE IS A DEADLINE AND IF THE DEMANDS ARE NOT MET 
OR IF ISRAEL IS NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE 
AND TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT 
THEY WOULD START KILLING US 
FOR ONE OF THE PALESTINIAN HIJACKERS FAYEZ JABER 
THESE DEMANDS WERE PERSONAL 
AT THE TOP OF THE LIST OF PRISONERS THEY WANTED RELEASED 
WAS HIS COUSIN AND CHILDHOOD FRIEND ABDUL RAHIM 
HE WAS A SENIOR COMMANDER OF THE P. F. L. P. 
AND SERVING NINE LIFE SENTENCES FOR TERRORISM 
DID YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE RELEASED 
OH YES I HAD SO MUCH HOPE 
I ALMOST FELT LIKE I WAS OUT OF PRISON ALREADY 
IT WAS A POWERFUL FEELING 
IT WAS ALL HAPPENING SO FAR AWAY FROM ISRAEL 
SO I KNEW IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE ISRAELIS TO RESCUE THEM 
IT SEEMS TO MOST OF US THAT ISRAEL HAS NO MILITARY OPTION 
AND SO SHE'LL HAVE TO GIVE IN WITHOUT DELAY 
BECAUSE OF THE IMMENSE DISTANCE 
UGANDA ALMOST THE CENTRE OF AFRICA 
SOME IN THE ISRAELI MILITARY WERE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE FEASIBILITY OF A RESCUE OPERATION 
AND SOME OF ITS SOLDIERS KNEW UGANDA WELL 
I'D BEEN IN UGANDA TO TRAIN THEIR PARATROOPERS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE 
I'D EVEN BEEN TO VISIT THE ISRAELI COMMANDER AT THE AIRPORT 
SO I KNEW ENTEBBE 
ENTEBBE THE CAPITAL'S AIRPORT 
AND CROSSROADS OF MANY INTERNATIONAL AIRWAYS 
WE HAD TWO OPTIONS 
WE COULD EITHER GO THERE DIRECTLY BY PLANE 
OR WE COULD APPROACH VIA LAKE VICTORIA 
IT WAS ONLY ONE KILOMETRE FROM THE BEACH TO THE TERMINAL 
PEOPLE CAN COME AND STAY 
AND ENJOY ONE OF THE UNIQUE SIGHTS OF THE WORLD 
HERE YOU FIND THE LARGEST CROCODILES OF THE WORLD 
THE CROCODILES IN LAKE VICTORIA IMMEDIATELY RULED OUT 
THE POSSIBILITY OF PARACHUTING INTO THE WATER INTO THE LAKE 
WE CAN COPE WITH MANY THINGS 
BUT BATTLING WITH CROCODILES IS NOT ONE OF THEM 
BUT THE WILDLIFE WASN'T THE ONLY CHALLENGE THE ISRAELIS FACED 
THE HOSTAGES WERE BEING HELD 
IN A FAIRLY SMALL TERMINAL BUILDING 
AND THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY TERRORISTS READY TO PULL THE TRIGGER 
THEY COULD OPEN FIRE AND KILL THEM ALL IN JUST A FRACTION OF A SECOND 
WITH ONLY THREE DAYS TO COME UP WITH A RESCUE PLAN 
THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS SEEMED REMOTE 
THE HIJACKERS WERE IN CONTROL 
I ASKED THE GERMAN MAN WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO US 
HE SAID NO HARM WILL COME TO YOU 
THEY ARE NEGOTIATING AND YOU WILL BE RELEASED 
I ASKED HIM WHY HE A GERMAN WAS HERE 
AND HE MUMBLED SOMETHING ABOUT WORLD REVOLUTION AND THE NEED 
TO CHANGE THE WORLD BY FORCE TO HELP THE OPPRESSED AND THE WEAK 
THE SECOND DAY IN CAPTIVITY 
THE TWO HUNDRED TEN HOSTAGES WERE GRADUALLY COMING TO TERMS WITH THE BOREDOM 
THE SQUALOR AND THE UGANDAN CUISINE 
BUT THEN THE MOOD DARKENED 
THE GERMAN MAN AND WOMAN CAME IN FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE 
TO THE RECEPTION AREA 
THEY PUT DOWN THE BAG CONTAINING ALL OUR DOCUMENTS ON A SMALL TABLE 
THEY STARTED TO TAKE OUT OUR DOCUMENTS 
AND DIVIDE THEM INTO TWO PILES 
THE RIGHT HAND PILE CONTAINED ALL THE ISRAELI PASSPORTS 
THE ONE ON THE LEFT CONTAINED ALL THE PASSPORTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES 
ABU YAHID JOSEF 
THEY SAID WE WILL CALL THE NAMES AND THE NAMES THAT WE CALL GO TO THE OTHER ROOM 
RIFKA AND MICHAELA RABINOWICZ 
USI SARA RON AND BENJAMIN DAVIDSON 
AND AFTER THE SECOND OR THIRD NAME IT WAS EVIDENT 
THAT THEY'RE CALLING ONLY JEWS OR ISRAELIS 
NADIA ISRAEL 
ILAN HARTUV 
SHE WAS ANTI SEMITE YOU COULD HEAR IT IN THE THINGS SHE SAID 
DORA BLOCH 
WE HAD TO ASK PERMISSION TO GO TO THE TOILET 
SHE SAID ONLY PEOPLE LIKE YOU GO TO THE TOILET SO MUCH 
GABRIELA AND ABRAHAM RUBENSTEIN 
IT'S LIKE A NIGHTMARE 
I HAVE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT 
CALLING ISRAELI JEWISH NAMES GO TO THE OTHER ROOM 
AND DONE BY A GERMAN 
AFTER THE WORLD WAR WERE WITH ALL THESE MEMORIES THAT WE ALL HAD 
ZWIEBELSKI 
MICHAL BAJAFKSI 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE I I 
NO WORDS NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THAT 
ALL MY FAMILY GRANDPARENTS AUNTS UNCLES COUSINS YOUNG COUSINS BABIES 
ALL OF THEM WERE SENT TO TREBLINKA AND WENT BY THE GAS CHAMBERS 
AND THIS SUBJECT WAS INSIDE ME ALL THE YEARS AND I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND 
HOW CAN THEY DO IT AGAIN 
THAT YOUNG GERMANS WERE INVOLVED IN SUCH A POWERFULLY SYMBOLIC ACTION 
S. 
YET REVULSION FOR NAZISM WAS ONE OF THE FACTORS 
THAT HAD DRIVEN SOME TO VIOLENT REVOLUTION 
BY THE END OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WEST GERMANY WAS IN FERMENT 
THE POST WAR GENERATION WAS ANGRY 
ANGRY AT THE COUNTRY'S FAILURE TO CONFRONT ITS NAZI PAST 
ANGRY AT THE BLATANT CONSUMERISM OF THE GERMAN ECONOMIC MIRACLE 
ANGRY AT AMERICAN IMPERIALISM AND THE HORRORS OF VIETNAM 
THOUSANDS MARCHED IN PROTEST 
BUT SOME DID MORE THAN JUST MARCH THEY EMBRACED TERRORISM 
BRIGITTE KUHLMANN AND WILFRIED BOESE WERE FOUNDER MEMBERS 
OF AN UNDERGROUND GROUP CALLED REVOLUTIONARY CELLS 
BOESE WAS KNOWN TO HIS COMRADES AS BONNIE 
HE WAS A FRIENDLY GENEROUS PERSON 
HE LIKED TO LIVE 
HE WAS SITTING HOURS AND HOURS IN THE FRANCONIAN LITTLE RESTAURANTS 
WITH TYPICAL BRATWURST FROM NUREMBERG 
AND DRINKING WINE FROM FRANCONIA 
BRIGITTE OF COURSE WAS DIFFERENT FROM BONNIE 
SHE WAS LESS GENEROUS SHE WAS VERY DISCIPLINED 
AND SHE AWAITED FROM EVERYONE ELSE TO BE THE SAME WAY 
SHE WAS ALWAYS SAYING WE HAVE NOT MUCH TIME WE HAVE TO GO ON 
WE HAVE TO WORK WE HAVE TO DO THINGS 
AND NOT SITTING AROUND DRINKING FRANCONIA WINE 
SHORTLY BEFORE THE ENTEBBE OPERATION 
BRIGITTE KUHLMANN AND GERD SCHNEPEL WROTE A BOOK TOGETHER 
IT ENCAPSULATED THEIR VIEWS ON THE REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE 
URBAN GUERRILLAS ARE NOT JUST PEOPLE 
WHO ATTEND MEETINGS AND DEMONSTRATIONS 
BEING A GUERRILLA DEMANDS A TOTAL MERGING OF LIFE AND POLITICS 
EVERYBODY KNEW WE ARE IN A SITUATION 
WHERE FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER YOU CAN BE IN PRISON OR EVEN DEAD 
IT WAS AN ATMOSPHERE OF A LOT OF CLOSENESS BETWEEN THE PEOPLE 
AND ESPECIALLY OUR TWO FOUNDERS BONNIE AND BRIGITTE 
AND THEY WERE MORE THAN JUST CLOSE 
AT ONE STAGE BOESE AND KUHLMANN BECAME LOVERS 
BUT BY THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX KUHLMANN HAD TRANSFERRED HER AFFECTIONS 
BRIGITTE AND ME WERE AFTER SOME TIME KNOWING EACH OTHER 
WE WERE LOVERS WE WERE TOGETHER 
AND WE WERE ALSO STILL TOGETHER WHEN SHE WENT TO ENTEBBE 
MY LAST CONTACT WITH BRIGITTE WAS A FEW DAYS BEFORE THIS ACTION 
SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE COULD NOT BE REACHED 
AND WOULD NOT SHOW UP FOR SOME TIME BUT SEE YOU LATER 
AND SHE SAID GOODBYE TO SEE US IN A NOT DEFINED FUTURE YOU KNOW 
YESTERDAY WE HOPED THE NIGHTMARE WOULD SOON BE OVER 
AND WE WOULD CONTINUE OUR HOLIDAY 
THIS NOW SEEMS REMOTE AND UNREALISTIC 
THE JEWISH HOSTAGES CALLED THE AREA THEY'D BEEN MOVED TO 
THE ROOM OF SEPARATION 
AND THERE THEY AWAITED THEIR FATE YOUNG AND OLD TOGETHER 
YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT DEATH 
AND YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT HOW FRIGHTENED YOU ARE 
TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK 
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY AT LEAST FOR A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD 
YOU'RE GETTING USED TO LIVING IN CAPTIVITY 
SO YOU HAVE FRIENDS AND YOU PLAY WITH THEM AND YOU READ BOOKS 
YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE YOU HAVE TO PASS THE TIME 
AND YOU PLAY FOOTBALL 
YEAH WITH A COCA COLA CAN 
FOR THE JEWS AND ISRAELIS THE SENSE OF ISOLATION BECAME EVEN MORE ACUTE 
SUDDENLY THE HIJACKERS WERE LETTING ALL THE OTHER HOSTAGES GO HOME 
WE FELT VERY BAD ABOUT IT BEING LEFT BEHIND 
AND KNOWING THAT OUR DESTINATION OR OUR FATE IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT 
BECAUSE WE SAW THEM GOING IN THESE GROUPS 
ONE GROUP AFTER THE OTHER AND WE STOOD BEHIND 
THEN ONE OF THE JEWISH HOSTAGES WAS SINGLED OUT 
THEY CALLED MY NAME 
NACHUM DAHAN 
I REPLIED THAT'S ME RIGHT COME OVER HERE 
NACHUM DAHAN WAS THEN TOLD TO WRITE DOWN EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING IN ISRAEL 
HE SAID HE'D BEEN ON A KIBBUTZ 
BUT THE PALESTINIANS WERE CONVINCED HE HAD A MILITARY CONNECTION 
THEY TOOK ME ALONG A STRAIGHT CORRIDOR 
AND THEN THEY TURNED TO THE RIGHT INTO A GREY ROOM 
HE WAS A BIG MAN 
HUGE HANDS AND VERY CRUEL EYES 
HE CAME UP TO ME 
WITH HIS GUN 
AND PLACED IT AGAINST MY TEMPLE 
I COULD FEEL THE COLD METAL OF THE GUN 
I WONDERED IF I WOULD EVER SEE MY FAMILY AGAIN 
HE GRABBED ME LIKE A SACK OF POTATOES AND THREW ME TO THE GROUND 
AND THEN HE STARTED TO KICK ME 
I SAW THE HATRED IN HIS EYES 
HE SET ON ME AND I WAS SCREAMING SCREAMING 
THE PALESTINIANS' VICTIMISATION OF AN INNOCENT JEWISH HOSTAGE 
WAS ROOTED IN YEARS OF BITTERNESS AND DEPRIVATION 
THE CREATION OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT 
AND THE SUBSEQUENT ARAB ISRAELI WAR WERE THE SOURCE OF UNDYING HATRED 
FAMILIES LIKE THOSE OF THE TWO PALESTINIAN LEADERS IN ENTEBBE 
LOST THEIR LAND BECOMING STATELESS REFUGEES 
IN BLEAK CAMPS BEYOND ISRAEL'S BORDERS 
THE PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE WAS BORN 
HE WAS SO FULL OF LIFE AND ALWAYS LOVED PALESTINE 
EVEN WHEN HE WAS LITTLE 
HE USED TO LIKE BEING ACTIVE AND DEFENDING HIS COUNTRY 
HE ALWAYS FELT LIKE THIS 
FAYEZ AND I LIVED IN JERUSALEM WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN 
WE WITNESSED THE KILLING 
HAD BOMBS DROPPED ON US 
OUR NATION AND OUR PEOPLE 
FROM THAT DAY ON WE WERE INFLUENCED BY THESE EVENTS 
AND WHEN WE STARTED SCHOOL AND THEN BECAME YOUNG MEN 
WE BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT REVENGE 
BY NOW THE NON JEWISH HOSTAGES WERE ARRIVING IN PARIS 
WELCOMED BY THEIR RELIEVED AND GRATEFUL FAMILIES 
TERRIBLY DIFFICULT TERRIBLY FRIGHTENING 
WE WERE SURROUNDED CONTINUOUSLY BY HEAVILY ARMED GUARDS 
ON THEIR RETURN THEY TOLD THE WORLD 
ABOUT THE SEPARATION OF JEWISH AND NON JEWISH HOSTAGES 
THEY SAID THIS IS NOT HAPPENING TO US 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX FREE COUNTRY HERE THEY ARE GERMANS 
THEY'RE DOING THE SAME THING 
IT MADE ME VERY ANGRY 
AND READY TO KICK ASS AND TAKE NAMES 
THERE WERE NOW ONLY HOURS LEFT BEFORE THE HIJACKER'S DEADLINE 
IN ISRAEL THE HOSTAGES' FAMILIES WERE BESIEGING 
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT BEGGING THEM TO DO A DEAL 
TIME WAS RUNNING OUT AND THE FEAR ANXIETY AND FRUSTRATION 
OF THE RELATIVES OF THE ISRAELI HOSTAGES HELD AT ENTEBBE 
SPILLED OUT INTO AN ANGRY OUTPOURING OF EMOTION 
THEY DIRECTED THEIR RAGE AT A PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN 
WHO HAD COME TO ASSURE THEM THAT THE GOVERNMENT UNDERSTOOD THEIR DISTRESS 
BUT THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE DISTRAUGHT RELATIVES 
GIVE THE HIJACKERS WHAT THEY WANT THEY SCREAMED 
JUST LET OUR LOVED ONES COME BACK ALIVE 
PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN SAID 
GENTLEMEN I WANT TO FREE THE HOSTAGES 
HE TURNED TO THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE SHIMON PERES 
AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF MORDECHAI GUR 
AND SAID DO YOU HAVE A RESCUE PLAN THAT YOU CAN RECOMMEND 
THEY SAID THEY STILL HADN'T COME UP WITH A PLAN 
AND AT THAT POINT THE GOVERNMENT UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO GIVE IN TO THE TERRORISTS' DEMANDS 
THE PRIME MINISTER SAW A REPRESENTATIVE GROUP 
AND REVEALED THE GOVERNMENT HAD DECIDED TO NEGOTIATE 
WITH THE HIJACKERS TO SECURE THE RELEASE OF ALL OF THE HOSTAGES 
AND WAS READY TO RELEASE SOME TERRORISTS 
HELD IN ISRAELI JAILS IN RETURN 
THE REASON ISRAEL SOFTENED ITS LONG STANDING POLICY OF NO DEALS WITH HIJACKERS 
WAS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT FELT IT HAD NO CONTROL 
OVER THE SITUATION IN UGANDA 
THE ISRAELI MILITARY WERE DEAD SET AGAINST ANY DEAL 
BUT STILL HADN'T COME UP WITH A RESCUE PLAN 
THAT HAD ANY REALISTIC CHANCE OF SUCCESS 
DID YOU WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO DO THE DEAL 
NO HEAVEN FORBID 
WE HAD BEEN TELLING THE ENTIRE WORLD NOT TO GIVE IN TO TERRORISM 
BUT HERE WE WERE ABOUT TO GIVE IN TO IT OURSELVES 
THEN FROM ENTEBBE CAME DRAMATIC NEWS 
FROM B. B. C. WORLD SERVICE THIS IS LONDON 
ASHLEY HOUCHIN WITH THE NEWS 
THE DEADLINE AT ENTEBBE AIRPORT 
FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE HIJACKERS' DEMANDS 
HAS BEEN EXTENDED UNTIL ELEVEN HOURS GREENWICH MEAN TIME ON SUNDAY 
THE EXTENSION HAD BEEN REQUESTED BY IDI AMIN 
BECAUSE HE HAD TO MAKE A DIPLOMATIC TRIP TO MAURITIUS 
AS PRESIDENT OF THE ORGANISATION OF AFRICAN UNITY 
THE HIJACKERS HAPPILY COMPLIED WITH HIS REQUEST 
CONFIDENT THAT ISRAEL WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LAUNCH A RESCUE MISSION 
AMIN WAS SOMEONE THEY TRUSTED AND WITH GOOD REASON 
AMIN AND ISRAEL HAD ONCE BEEN ALLIES 
BUT BEFORE THE HIJACKING HAD FALLEN OUT 
AMIN WASN'T PAYING HIS BILLS 
SO AMIN FOUND A NEW FRIEND 
ENTEBBE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WAS CROWDED TO CAPACITY 
AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA 
AL HADJI GENERAL IDI AMIN DADA V. C. DSO M. C. 
AWAITED THE ARRIVAL OF PRESIDENT MUAMMAR AL GADDAFI 
OF THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF LIBYA WHO HAD COME FOR A THREE DAY STATE VISIT 
AMIN'S DEFECTION TO GADDAFI MARKED A NEW TWIST IN THE AGE OF TERROR 
GADAFFI WAS A PROMINENT SUPPORTER OF THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE 
AND NOW AMIN WAS TOO 
HE INVITED THE PALESTINIANS TO OPEN AN OFFICE IN THE UGANDAN CAPITAL 
AND HE EVEN OFFERED THEM A DES RES' 
THE FORMER ISRAELI EMBASSY 
ON THIS OCCASION COLONEL GADAFFI POINTED OUT 
THE ADVANTAGES OF AIR TRAVEL IN BRINGING NATIONS CLOSER TOGETHER 
AMIN WAS THE HIJACKERS' ACCOMPLICE NOT A NEUTRAL GO BETWEEN 
BUT BY FALLING INTO LINE WITH HIS DIPLOMATIC DIARY 
AND EXTENDING THE DEADLINE 
THEY GAVE THE ISRAELIS SOMETHING THEY DESPERATELY NEEDED TIME 
IN TEL AVIV ISRAEL'S DEFENCE FORCE WAS NOW FORMULATING A PLAN 
THAT WAS EVEN MORE AUDACIOUS THAN THE HIJACKING OF THE PLANE 
THE ARMY HAD A UNIT OF SPECIAL FORCES CALLED SAYERET MATKAL 
SPECIALLY TRAINED TO COMBAT TERRORISM 
THEY SHARED THEIR MOTTO WITH THE BRITISH S. A. S. WHO DARES WINS 
THIRTY OF THESE COMBAT HARDENED TROOPS AND OVER TWO HUNDRED INFANTRY 
WOULD FLY TO UGANDA IN FOUR TRANSPORT PLANES 
THEN LAND AT ENTEBBE UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS 
THE SPECIAL STRIKE FORCE WOULD THEN BURST INTO THE TERMINAL 
OUR UNIT WAS SUPPOSED TO STORM THE BUILDING 
KILL THEM AND SECURE THE BUILDING ITSELF 
UNTIL ALL THE ADDITIONAL FORCES HAD LANDED 
IT WAS A HIGH RISK STRATEGY 
SUCCESS RESTED ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE PILOT OF THE LEAD PLANE 
WE'D NEED TO OVERCOME A COUPLE OF THINGS 
ONE OF THEM WAS THE SURPRISE 
TO FLY TO AVOID ALL THE RADARS SO NOBODY WILL SEE US 
AND THE OTHER ONE WAS TO LAND 
TO EXPECT TO LAND ON A DARK RUNWAY WHICH IS NOT AN EASY EXERCISE 
AS IF LANDING WASN'T HAIRY ENOUGH 
THE STRIKE FORCE THEN HAD TO DRIVE ALMOST A MILE TO THE TERMINAL 
WITHOUT BEING SPOTTED BY THE UGANDANS 
MUKI BETSER HAD A BRAIN WAVE 
IN UGANDA MINISTERS INCLUDING IDI AMIN HIMSELF 
ARE USUALLY DRIVEN IN BLACK MERCEDES 
WHEN A UGANDAN SOLDIER IN UNIFORM SEES A BLACK MERCEDES APPROACHING 
HE STANDS TO ATTENTION AND SALUTES 
SO WE WENT TO THE MOSSAD THE SECRET SERVICES AND REQUESTED A BLACK CAR 
BUT THEY SENT US A WHITE ONE 
SO THE FIRST THING WE HAD TO DO WAS SPRAY IT BLACK 
THEY WOULD NEVER OPEN FIRE ON A VEHICLE LIKE THAT 
AND BY THE TIME THEY REALISED WHAT WAS GOING ON 
OUR FORCES WOULD HAVE STORMED INTO THE TERMINAL 
AND STRUCK AT THE TERRORISTS 
AS THE SPECIAL FORCES REFINED THEIR RESCUE PLAN 
THE HIJACKERS IN ENTEBBE HEARD THE NEWS 
THE ISRAELIS WERE PREPARING TO DO A DEAL 
AND RELEASE THEIR JAILED COMRADES 
JA'IL WAS HOLDING A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE 
AND HE SAID TO HIM DRINK 
AND HE REPLIED DRINK WHAT IS GOING ON 
AND JA'IL REPLIED WE'VE DONE IT 
ISRAEL HAS AGREED TO EXCHANGE TERRORISTS FOR HOSTAGES 
SO DRINK DRINK 
FRIDAY EVENING WAS A VERY SAD NIGHT 
WE HAVE TRADITIONS OF LIGHTING CANDLES ON FRIDAY EVENING 
SAYING SOME BLESSING DRINKING WINE 
BECAUSE OF THE SABBATH BECAUSE OF THE SABBATH YES 
INSTEAD OF CANDLES JUST TWO MATCHES JUST FOR FEELING THAT WE LIT CANDLES 
I NEVER LIT CANDLES BEFORE THAT 
SINCE THEN I LIT EVERY FRIDAY 
AS ISRAELIS PRAYED FOR THE HOSTAGES 
THEIR GOVERNMENT STILL HADN'T DECIDED 
WHETHER TO RISK A MILITARY RESCUE 
THE ASSAULT TEAM WAITED ANXIOUSLY FOR WORD FROM THE POLITICIANS 
IN ENTEBBE THE HIJACKERS WERE ALSO WAITING FOR WORD FROM TEL AVIV 
TO CONFIRM THAT ISRAEL HAD CAPITULATED 
THE DEADLINE WAS LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AWAY 
WHEN AMIN RETURNED FROM HIS CONFERENCE IN MAURITIUS 
THE MOOD WAS GLOOMY 
WHEN WE ARRIVED THERE THEN HE TELLS THE HOSTAGES IN HUSHED VOICE THAT 
GENTLEMEN I'VE TRIED MY LEVEL BEST TO SECURE YOUR RELEASE 
THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS BUT YOUR GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL 
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE COOPERATIVE 
AND THEREFORE WHATEVER IS GOING TO HAPPEN 
PLEASE DON'T BLAME ME 
IDI AMIN CAME AGAIN AFTER THIS CONFERENCE HE HAD IN MAURITIUS 
AND HE SAID THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE BROKE 
AND SINCE SUNDAY THE NEXT DAY THEY ARE STARTING TO KILL GROUPS OF US 
OF COURSE THE MOOD WAS TERRIBLE 
THE HOSTAGES FOR THEIR PART 
AT THAT MOMENT THEY LOOKED VERY MISERABLE 
AND SOME HAD STARTED BREAKING DOWN IN TEARS 
AND THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE EXECUTED BY THE HOSTAGE TAKERS 
AND AMIN DIDN'T SEEM TO BE REALLY EXPRESSING ANY SYMPATHIES FOR THAT 
ON THAT DESPERATE SATURDAY 
THE YOUNG BENNY DAVIDSON HAD A STRANGE PREMONITION 
WHETHER I WAS DELUSIONAL OR DREAMING DAYDREAMING OR NOT 
I DON'T THINK SO 
I HAD A GUT FEELING 
AND TOLD IT TO MY PARENTS YOU'LL SEE TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT 
THE I. D. F. WILL COME TO RESCUE US 
IF BENNY DAVIDSON'S PREMONITION WAS TO BECOME REALITY 
ISRAEL'S SPECIAL FORCES SHOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN STARTING UP THE ENGINES 
THE GOVERNMENT WAS STILL UNABLE TO REACH A DECISION 
THAT WAS THE PROBLEM 
SO I TELEPHONED THE PRIME MINISTER'S FIRST SECRETARY AND TOLD HIM 
THEY HAD TO DO SOMETHING OR WE'D HAVE TO CANCEL THE MISSION 
HE ASKED WHAT DID WE SUGGEST 
AND I SAID ALLOW US TO TAKE OFF 
YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER FOUR HOURS TO CONTINUE YOUR DEBATE 
AND THEN YOU CAN EITHER TELL US TO CARRY ON 
OR IF YOU WANT US TO RETURN THEN WE WILL RETURN 
WE TOOK OFF BUT WE STILL DIDN'T KNOW 
IF THE MISSION WOULD GO AHEAD 
THE GOVERNMENT STILL HADN'T REACHED A DECISION 
SOMEWHERE OVER ETHIOPIA WE RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE 
AUTHORISED GOOD LUCK 
THE RESCUE MISSION WAS FINALLY ON ITS WAY TO ENTEBBE 
BUT ONE OF THE HOSTAGES WAS MISSING 
A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD BRITISH WOMAN CALLED DORA BLOCH 
HAD CHOKED ON A PIECE OF MEAT 
SHE'D BEEN TAKEN TO HOSPITAL IN THE UGANDAN CAPITAL KAMPALA 
SHE SAID LOOK I'M NOT AFRAID AT ALL 
I LIVED ALL MY LIFE AND I WAS SO HAPPY AND I HAVE A VERY RICH LIFE 
THE ONLY THING I DO CARE ABOUT IS MY SON ILAN WHO IS HERE WITH ME 
I ASKED TO GO WITH HER 
BUT THE GERMAN WOMAN STARTED SHOUTING AT THE TOP OF HER VOICE 
OH BY NO MEANS CERTAINLY NOT IMPOSSIBLE 
YOU KNOW THERE IS A TIME THAT YOU'RE FLYING AND FLYING AND FLYING 
AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR WATCH 
AND YOU UNDERSTAND THERE IS NO WAY BACK ANY MORE 
BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH FUEL 
THEN WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT'S IT 
I REALLY DID NOT HAVE ANY FEAR OF BEING KILLED OR WOUNDED 
ABSOLUTELY ZERO NOTHING 
I WORRIED EXTREMELY MUCH ABOUT FAILURE 
I WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD AND SOMEBODY PUT THIS RESPONSIBILITY ON MY SHOULDER 
AND I WASN'T READY FOR IT 
THIS WAS THE WORST FLIGHT I EVER HAD IT WAS TERRIBLE 
I BECAME EXTREMELY SICK AND 
YOU THROW UP MAYBE TEN TIMES 
AND ALL THE FLOOR OF THE PLANE WAS COVERED 
WITH ALL THE THROW UPS OF ALL OF US 
BUT THE STRIKE FORCE COMMANDER YONI NETANYAHU 
SEEMED UNAFFECTED BY TURBULENCE OR TENSION 
I DID FIND HIM A REMARKABLY COOL MAN 
LATER IN THE AEROPLANE 
HE SURPRISED ME THAT I FOUND HIM SLEEPING 
HE SLEPT LIKE A BABY 
I SAID HOW THE HELL THIS GUY HAVE THIS NERVE TO SLEEP NOW 
HE'S GOT ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT CHANCE TO LIVE FROM THIS 
IN THE TERMINAL ONE HUNDRED FOUR HOSTAGES AND THEIR CAPTORS 
WERE NOW COUNTING THE HOURS TO THE SUNDAY DEADLINE 
SATURDAY EVENING 
QUIET 
VERY HOT AGAIN MOSQUITOES EVERYTHING 
AND MANY PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING ON THE MATTRESSES THERE 
BENNY WAS TRYING TO SLEEP CLOSE TO US 
AND RON MY BIG SON AND ME WITH ANOTHER COUPLE OF THE HOSTAGES 
WE WERE PLAYING CARDS 
TOWARDS MIDNIGHT THE ISRAELI PLANES APPROACHED ENTEBBE 
WE LANDED AND I DON'T KNOW WHY 
I KNEW THAT NOBODY HAD SPOTTED US I JUST KNEW IT 
TOTAL QUIET NOTHING WAS MOVING 
THE MOMENT THE WHEELS HIT THE GROUND I IMMEDIATELY LOADED THE GUN 
MY WEAPON IT WAS AN A. K. FORTY SEVEN A KALASHNIKOV 
AND IMMEDIATELY ONE OF MY FRIENDS SHOUTED ON ME 
YOU SHOULDN'T LOAD YOUR GUN WITHIN THE PLANE 
AND I TOLD HIM SHUT UP THIS IS A REAL WAR NO RULES ANY MORE 
I CONTINUED ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF THE RUNWAY 
TURNED RIGHT TO THE OLD TERMINAL WHERE THEY KEPT THE HOSTAGES 
AND GOT AS CLOSE AS I CAN WITHOUT MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE OF THE ENGINE 
I MEAN IT WAS LIKE A KILOMETRE AWAY OR SO AND STOPPED THE AEROPLANE 
THEN WHEN HE OPENED THE BACK DOOR YOU KNOW I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE 
TIGERS OR LIONS OR GIRAFFES OR WHATEVER IT IS ON THE AIRFIELD 
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING 
IT WAS A STANDARD AIRSTRIP LIKE IN ALL OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD 
I GAVE THE GREEN LIGHT TO THE MERCEDES 
THE TWO LAND ROVERS WITH THE SPECIAL FORCES 
WITH YONI AND MUKI AND OTHERS TO DRIVE FROM THE BACK 
AND I SAW THEM DRIVING QUIETLY DOWN THE ONE KILOMETRE TO THE TERMINAL 
I HEAR PLANES LANDING AND THEN I HEAR BOOT STAMPING 
SOME OF THE INFANTRYMEN WHO HAD BEEN DEPLOYED AROUND 
BEGAN SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER IN SWAHILI 
THAT MAYBE THE CHILDREN OF GOD ARE COMING 
THE CHILDREN OF GOD THE CHILDREN OF GOD 
THAT WAS THE JOKE AMONG SOLDIERS 
SOLDIERS USED TO TERM ISRAELI SOLDIERS OR ISRAEL 
AS THE CHILDREN OF GOD AS STIPULATED IN THE BIBLE 
THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE A MINUTE OR TWO OF DRIVING IN DARKNESS 
AND I SAW THIS GUARD RAISING HIS RIFLE 
AIMING IT TOWARD THE MERCEDES 
THE UGANDAN SOLDIER RAISES HIS WEAPON 
AND SHOUTS OUT ADVANCE 
ADVANCE JUST MEANT COME FORWARD I WANT TO IDENTIFY YOU 
I SAID TO YONI YONI LEAVE IT IT'S JUST ROUTINE 
BUT YONI INSISTED AND HE GAVE AN ORDER 
WITH SILENCERS ON THE ISRAELIS SHOT THE SENTRY BUT ONLY WOUNDED HIM 
SOMEONE FROM THE MERCEDES 
AND SOMEONE FROM THE LAND ROVER OPENED FIRE AT THE SAME TIME 
WITHOUT USING SILENCERS 
THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE WAS LOST 
I JUMPED FROM THE BACK OF THE LAST LAND ROVER 
AND I LOOKED TO THE LEFT I LOOKED TO THE RIGHT 
THERE WAS DARKNESS AND I DIDN'T SEE MY COMMANDER 
I SAW THAT AMIR HAD STARTED RUNNING TOWARDS THE TERMINAL 
I WASN'T ENTIRELY SURE WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HIS HEAD 
BUT I STARTED TO RUN AFTER HIM 
SOMEONE WAS IN THE TERMINAL SHOOTING OUTSIDE 
AND THIS SHOTS BROKE THE GLASS AND WAS SHOOTING AT ME 
YOU KNOW THE BULLETS ONE WAS HERE ONE WAS THERE 
BUT I WAS SO FOCUSED I DIDN'T HEAR THE SHOTS AT ALL 
I JUST SAW HIM SHOOTING 
I SHOT SOMETHING LIKE THREE OR FOUR SHOTS AND ALL OF THEM HIT HIM 
ONE AFTER ONE TAC TAC TAC 
I REMEMBER HEARING A NOISE 
THAT TO ME RESEMBLED 
A BOX OF GLASS BOTTLES DROPPING 
AND TO ME AS A KID 
ALL HELL BROKE THROUGH 
I GRABBED BENNY HE WAS HALF ASLEEP 
AND IN A SECOND THERE WAS SUCH A SHOOTING ALL AROUND 
THAT WE COULDN'T EVEN THINK WHERE IT COMES FROM 
AND WHAT PASSED MY MIND OF COURSE WAS THAT EVERYTHING IS 
THAT'S THE END OF IT 
I JUMPED INTO THE TERMINAL THROUGH THE DOOR 
SHOT HIM AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT HE WILL NOT RECOVER OR SO 
BUT HE WAS DEAD 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PER CENT 
AS I ENTERED THERE WERE TWO OF THEM 
A MAN AND A WOMAN SITTING ON THE LEFT OF THE DOOR 
AND BOTH OF THEM WERE AIMING THEIR WEAPONS AT AMIR'S BACK 
I SHOT THEM BOTH ONCE OR TWICE 
AND THEN KICKED THEIR WEAPONS AWAY FROM THEM 
THEY WERE ALREADY AIMING AT MY BACK 
FROM A DISTANCE OF SOMETHING LIKE TWO METRES OR SO 
WHAT A LUCK 
I WAS FRIGHTENED AS HELL 
I SIMPLY LAID ON THE GROUND 
MY MOTHER ON TOP OF ME MY FACE TO THE GROUND 
AND I HEARD BENNY PRAYING UNDERNEATH ME 
WITH ALL THIS SHOOTING AROUND 
ALL THIS NOISES AND SMELLS AND EVERYTHING 
AND SMOKE ALL OVER I HEARD BENNY PRAYING SHEMA YISRAEL 
SHEMA YISRAEL IS THE MOST KNOWN JEWISH PRAYER 
SHEMA YISRAEL 
EXCUSE ME 
SHEMA YISRAEL ADONAI ELOHEINU ADONAI ECHAD 
WHICH MEANS LISTEN ISRAEL THE LORD IS OUR KING 
AND THEN 
I DON'T RECALL THE REST OF THE PRAYER BUT 
THIS IS WHAT CAME TO MY MIND 
SUDDENLY A TERRORIST ON THE LEFT GOT UP 
WE SHOT HIM IN THE CHEST AND HE FELL DOWN DEAD 
AND THEN WAS A MINUTE OF QUIET 
THEY STOPPED THE SHOOTING SOMEHOW 
AND SOMEBODY SAID IN HEBREW LISTEN THERE ARE ISRAELI GUYS HERE 
AND I REMEMBER SEEING AN ISRAELI SOLDIER WITH A BIG GUN 
STANDING THERE LOOKING AT US 
AND SAID LISTEN GUYS WE CAME TO TAKE YOU HOME 
TOLD YOU IT'S A MOMENT I CAN'T DESCRIBE 
IT'S THIRTY ONE YEARS AND I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
A SOLDIER WITH A LOUDHAILER SHOUTED OUT IN BOTH HEBREW AND ENGLISH 
WE ARE THE I. D. F. STAY DOWN DO NOT GET UP 
YOU COULDN'T SEE A SINGLE HEAD THEY ALL STICK TO THE GROUND ABSOLUTELY 
EXCEPT ONE WHO JUMPED 
THE ONE WHO JUMPED WAS AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD FRENCH ISRAELI 
JEAN JACQUES MAIMONI 
I TRIED TO TELL HIM JEAN JACQUES VIENS ICI COME HERE 
BUT HE DIDN'T HEAR ME 
AND THEN I SAW HIM JUMPING SAYING THANKS FOR SAVING ME 
HE JUMPED UP AND ANYONE WHO DOES THAT IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION 
IS PUTTING HIMSELF AT GREAT RISK 
WE HAD MISTAKEN HIM FOR A TERRORIST AND KILLED HIM 
I REMEMBER PEOPLE WOUNDED DEAD AROUND ME SMELLS SMOKE 
SHOOTING OUTSIDE AND THIS SOLDIER SAID CALM DOWN AND COME WITH ME 
ONE OF THE HOSTAGES CAME UP TO ME AND HE SAID 
MY MOTHER IS AN ELDERLY WOMAN SHE HAD A CHOKING ATTACK 
AND SHE'S STILL IN THE HOSPITAL IN KAMPALA 
I TOLD HIM WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS NOW 
BUT WE'D DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM AS SOON AS WE GOT BACK TO ISRAEL 
I KNEW THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF GOING TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE SHE WAS 
AND GETTING HER OUT 
EVERYBODY WAS TELLING ME 
THAT AFRICANS ARE USUALLY VERY KIND TO OLD WOMEN 
I SAID YES AFRICANS ARE 
I'VE BEEN TO AFRICA I KNOW IT BUT NOT AN ANIMAL LIKE IDI AMIN 
AFTER WE HAD EVACUATED THE HOSTAGES 
I DID A LAST SWEEP OF THE TERMINAL 
I SAW THE TERRORISTS LYING THERE DEAD 
THE GERMAN WAS LYING NEXT TO THE GERMAN WOMAN 
HE HAD A SURPRISED EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE 
THE WOMAN'S FACE LOOKED VERY ANGRY HER FACE LOOKED FURIOUS 
THE TWO PALESTINIANS WERE LYING THERE AS IF THEY WERE ONLY ASLEEP 
THEY SEEMED COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS TO EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED 
DO YOU KNOW WHO THE TERRORIST WAS WHOM YOU SHOT 
YES I KNOW I THINK THERE IS A QUESTION WHETHER HE WAS THE GERMAN 
OR THE GERMAN WAS TO THE LEFT I THINK HE WAS A GERMAN BUT 
I WOULD PREFER TO THINK THAT HE WAS A GERMAN YOU KNOW WHY 
WHY BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY LONG UNSETTLED ACCOUNT WITH THE GERMANS 
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN I CAME BACK HOME 
AND I TOLD MY MOTHER WHO WAS A TEN YEARS OLD GIRL 
DURING THE HOLOCAUST IN EASTERN EUROPE 
NOT THE NICEST PLACE TO BE 
IT'S NOT THAT I'M PROUD THAT I KILLED SOMEONE 
REALLY I'M NOT PROUD OF KILLING SOMEONE 
BUT IN THIS SITUATION 
THAT A GERMAN WILL GIVE HANDS TO SOMEONE WHO IS HIJACKING CITIZENS 
I THINK HE DESERVED IT 
MUKI BETSER TRIED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH HIS UNIT 
WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY NEWS 
HAVE HOSTAGES TEAM INTACT NO CASUALTIES 
I RADIOED TO YONI OVER THE MOTOROLA 
THAT THE MISSION WAS COMPLETE 
BUT THEN THE COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER SCREAMED BACK OVER THE RADIO 
YONI'S BEEN HIT YONI'S HIT 
YONI NETANYAHU DIED A FEW HOURS LATER 
THE ONLY ISRAELI SOLDIER TO LOSE HIS LIFE 
THE BROTHER OF FUTURE PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU 
YONI BECAME A NATIONAL HERO 
IN BULK MY FEELINGS WERE POSITIVE 
WE HAD CARRIED OUT OUR PLAN AND FROM A MILITARY POINT OF VIEW 
IT HAD BEEN A SUCCESS 
BUT I HAD ALSO LOST A FRIEND 
WE HAD LOST YONI WE HAD LOST OUR COMRADE 
THIS WAS SO SAD A DIFFICULT FEELING 
WE CAME INTO LAND AND THE REAR RAMP GAPED WIDE 
WE WERE CONFRONTED BY A SEA OF FACES 
I WAS ENGULFED IN JOY AND LOVE 
CAN ANYONE UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE WORD HOME 
I JUST CAN'T EXPLAIN IT 
WHY DID YOUR BROTHER DIE 
FREEDOM FIGHTERS MARTYR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR COUNTRY 
THEY FIGHT TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY 
WHY WAS HE MARTYRED HE DIDN'T JUST DIE FOR HIS OWN SAKE 
HE DIED DEFENDING HIS COUNTRY 
AFTERWARDS I READ IN THE PRESS 
THAT FAYEZ JABER HAD BEEN RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE OPERATION AND WAS KILLED 
IT WAS A HUGE SHOCK TO ME 
HE WAS A CHILDHOOD FRIEND 
AS WELL AS BEING A FRIEND IN THE RESISTANCE STRUGGLE 
I WAS HURT AND UPSET IN EVERY WAY 
THE ISRAELIS HAVE DECLARED THAT THEY ACTED ALONE 
IN RESCUING THEIR HOSTAGES HELD BY HIJACKERS IN UGANDA 
PRESIDENT AMIN HAS SAID THE DEAD HIJACKERS 
WERE FIVE PALESTINIANS AND TWO GERMANS' 
MY FIRST REACTION OF COURSE WAS AT NIGHT WHEN I HEARD IT ON THE RADIO 
COMPLETELY BEING KNOCKED DOWN 
SAD DESPERATE THAT MY CLOSEST FRIENDS WERE DEAD 
AND MYSELF I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT LEAVING THE GROUP 
I SAID TO THE OTHERS WE HAVE NO CHANCE TO WIN THIS FIGHT 
THE ENEMY IS TOO STRONG 
WE HAVE TO FIND NEW WAYS TO RESIST 
THIS WAY OF DOING MILITARY RESISTANCE IS NOT THE CORRECT 
AND PROMISING WAY OF THE SONG WE SHALL OVERCOME ONE DAY 
BACK IN UGANDA DORA BLOCH'S FATE 
RESTED IN THE HANDS OF A THWARTED AND FURIOUS IDI AMIN 
WE KNOW THAT SHE WAS DRAGGED DOWN THE STEPS FROM THE FOURTH FLOOR 
AND THAT A DOCTOR AND NURSES HER GUARD WERE ALL KILLED BY THE 
WHO TRIED TO INTERVENE 
WERE ALL KILLED BY THE KILLER GANGS OF IDI AMIN 
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW SHE WAS KILLED 
NOT EXACTLY BUT I IMAGINE SHE WAS SHOT 
AND I DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE EXACT DETAILS 
DO YOU THINK THAT IDI AMIN 
WOULD HAVE AUTHORISED THE KILLING OF YOUR MOTHER 
WE'RE SURE 
WE'RE SURE THEY WOULDN'T KILL A FOREIGNER WITHOUT HIS AUTHORISATION 
I'M SURE THAT WHEN HE KNEW THAT THERE WAS A WOMAN LEFT AND 
HE GAVE THE EXPRESS ORDERS TO KILL HER 
THE RAID ON ENTEBBE WAS A VICTORY OVER TERROR 
BUT THERE WAS A PRICE 
FOUR ISRAELI CIVILIANS AND ONE SOLDIER DIED IN THE FIRE FIGHT 
MORE THAN TWENTY UGANDAN TROOPS WERE KILLED 
AND OF COURSE THE PALESTINIAN AND GERMAN HIJACKERS 
ENTEBBE WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF TERROR INTERNATIONAL 
A GOVERNMENT HAD HIT BACK AND HIT BACK HARD 
HIJACKING AND HOSTAGE TAKING FELL OUT OF FASHION FOR THE PALESTINIANS 
AND THE REVOLUTIONARY DREAMERS OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
BUT MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AFTER ENTEBBE 
THE UNRESOLVED PROBLEM OF PALESTINE 
PROVOKES EVER MORE VIOLENT RESISTANCE 
TODAY IT'S YOUNG SUICIDE BOMBERS 
AND ISRAEL RESPONDS WITH EVER MORE MERCILESS FIREPOWER 
DO YOU THINK THE PROBLEM OF PALESTINE CAN BE RESOLVED 
I HOPE SO THERE IS NO OTHER WAY 
WE HAVE NO WAY TO GO NOWHERE TO GO 
SO WE HAVE TO STAY HERE WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT 
AND I DO LIKE IT I LOVE MY COUNTRY VERY MUCH 
BUT IT HAS TO BE SOLVED WE CAN'T LIVE ALL THE TIME ON SWORDS 
IN THE DECADE AFTER ENTEBBE 
THE PROMOTION OF TERROR BY ROGUE NATIONS WOULD ESCALATE 
RAISING THE STAKES FOR BOTH TERRORISTS AND GOVERNMENTS 
AND MORE THAN EVER BEFORE IT WOULD BE INNOCENT CIVILIANS WHO SUFFERED 
THE AGE OF TERROR WAS ABOUT TO TAKE ON A SAVAGE NEW FORM 
THE NEXT PROGRAMME TEN DAYS OF TERROR 
LIBYA EXPOSED SECRETLY SUPPLYING ARMS TO THE I. R. A. 
AND CIVILIANS MASSACRED ON REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY IN ENNISKILLEN
