GET RID OF THE DOG OR GO AND FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO LIVE 
AND DUPLO AND ABBIE ARE THE SCOURGE OF THEIR CUL DE S. A. C. 
ONCE THEY'VE STARTED I JUST CANNOT CONTROL THEM 
IT'S ALL OF MY STRENGTH TO HOLD THEM BACK 
THE OWNERS OF THESE DOGS HAVE HAD ENOUGH 
IT'S TIME FOR DRASTIC ACTION 
DOG BORSTAL 
THIS IS THE LAST RESORT FOR BAD DOGS 
DOG BORSTAL HAS BEEN SET UP ON AN ISOLATED EX AIR FORCE BASE 
AND IT'S RUN BY THREE OF BRITAIN'S TOUGHEST TRAINERS 
THE DOG IS A DOG NOT A CHILD 
EACH TRAINER USES THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL METHODS 
DOG BORSTAL IS A DISCIPLINE REGIME 
I'VE NEVER MET A DOG I CAN'T TRAIN 
BUT TO REFORM BAD DOGS THEY HAVE TO TAKE ON THEIR OWNERS 
DOG IN THESE PEOPLE HAVE FAILED TO TRAIN THEIR DOGS 
OUR JOB IS TO MAKE THEM SUCCEED 
THE TRAINERS HAVE READ THEIR CASE NOTES NOW IT'S TIME TO FACE THE DOGS 
AT HOME IN THEIR IPSWICH BUNGALOW MIDDLE AGED TERRIERS DUPLO AND ABBIE 
LIVE IN DOMESTIC BLISS WITH THEIR OWNER BEV 
THIS IS WHERE THE DOGS ARE FED 
AT NINE A M. THEY HAVE THEIR FOOD IN HERE 
THEY'RE ALWAYS UNDER MY FEET WHEN I'M COOKING IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL 
THAT'S THE FAVOURITE SPOT OF DUPLO BY THE AGA 
HE JUST LOVES IT THERE 
THEY GO TO A SPECIAL BEAUTICIAN FOR A FULL PAMPERING OF THE NAILS THE HAIRCUT THEN IT'S BLOW DRIED 
JUST LIKE US LADIES REALLY THEY LOVE TO BE PAMPERED 
BUT DUPLO AND ABBIE HAVE A WILD SIDE 
NO WHAT'S THAT ABOUT 
LOOK YOU WERE NICE AND CALM 
AN ANTI SOCIAL HABIT SO BAD THAT THEIR OWNER BEV HASN'T WALKED THEM IN PUBLIC FOR SIX YEARS 
HERE'S WHY 
WHEN THEY MEET OTHER DOGS THEY JUST GO CRAZY 
THEY BARK AND PULL ON THE LEAD AND THEY'RE TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL 
THIS IS JUST SO EMBARRASSING 
I CAN'T WALK A FEW YARDS DOWN THE ROAD THAT THEY DON'T START 
JUST ONCE THEY'VE STARTED I CANNOT CONTROL THEM 
IT'S ALL MY STRENGTH TO HOLD THEM BACK 
I HAVE TO TURN AROUND AND COME HOME BECAUSE THE WHOLE WALK 
WOULD JUST BE A CONTINUATION OF WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY SAW THE DOG 
THEY WOULD THEN START TO PICK ON PEOPLE ON BIKES 
LADIES WITH BABIES IN BUGGIES ANYTHING THAT MOVED BASICALLY 
WE HAD THAT SET TO DIDN'T WE OH YES WITH THAT LABRADOR THAT WAS TERRIBLE WEREN'T IT 
WE BOTH CAME HOME IN FLOODS OF TEARS 
A REAL SITUATION WHERE YOU WISH THERE WAS A BIG HOLE IN THE GROUND 
THAT WOULD SWALLOW YOU UP AND THE DOGS AS WELL 
THAT WAS SIX YEARS AGO EASILY 
THAT IS THE LAST TIME THAT WE DID TAKE THEM OUT IN GENERAL PUBLIC 
DUPLO AND ABBIE WERE EXPELLED FROM LOCAL DOG TRAINING CLASSES FOR CAUSING HAVOC 
NOW THERE'S NOWHERE LEFT TO GO BUT DOG BORSTAL 
THEY'LL BE FACED WITH BORSTAL'S TOUGHEST INSTRUCTOR NICK MARTIN 
AND HE'S BEEN READING UP ON THEM 
IN MY CAREER AS A DOG TRAINER AND A DOG HANDLER 
I'VE SEARCHED FOR EXPLOSIVES I'VE SEARCHED FOR DRUGS AND I'VE TRAINED DOGS TO BITE PEOPLE 
I'M ABOUT TO TAKE A CHALLENGE AND TRAIN TWO YORKSHIRE TERRIERS TO BECOME REAL DOGS 
THIS COULD BE THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DONE 
JUST GET OUT OF THE CAR 
DOGS BARK 
JUST GRAB HOLD OF YOUR DOG 
DUPLO AND ABBIE'S OWNER BEV HAS BROUGHT DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE ALONG FOR MORAL SUPPORT 
THE TWO DOGS HAVE JUST ESCAPED WHICH ISN'T REALLY A GOOD START 
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WE'RE GOING TO GET THE DOGS OUT YOU'LL HOLD THE LEADS 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LET THE DOGS RUN AWAY WE DON'T WANT MISTAKES 
WE'VE GOTTA SHOW THE REST HOW IT'S DONE GRAB THE LEAD DON'T LET HIM JUMP OUT 
THE DOGS ARE NINE YEARS OLD IT'S CRUCIAL THAT THEY PASS A PHYSICAL 
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE UP TO NICK'S DEMANDING TRAINING STYLE 
NEXT THE RULES OF THE KENNEL BLOCK 
WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THAT DOOR THAT SAYS DOG IN 
EVERY TIME YOU GO IN WHILE YOU'RE ON THIS COURSE 
YOU'RE GOING TO SHOUT DOG IN AS LOUD AS YOU CAN 
COS THERE'S PEOPLE IN THERE THAT NEED TO HEAR IT 
SO BEFORE WE START LET'S HEAR YOUR DOG IN COMMAND 
DOG IN THAT'S GOOD 
SO OPEN THE DOOR GIVE YOUR SHOUT DOG IN 
WAIT GO THROUGH THE DOOR 
JUST WAIT THE OTHER SIDE FOR ME 
O. K. BEV OFF YOU GO MATE DOG IN 
GRAB YOUR BEDDING GO THROUGH THE DOOR 
NUMBER ONE STANDARD MILITARY KENNEL 
AND JUST GO IN I'M GOING TO FILL YOUR BOWLS UP PUT THAT IN YOUR BUCKET 
SO THERE'S A DOG OUT DOWN THE BOTTOM 
SO IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU GO OUT OF THAT DOOR TO WALK YOUR DOG GUESS WHAT THE SHOUT IS DOG OUT 
VERY GOOD WATCH THE DOGS WATCH THE DOGS LOOSE DOG BACK ON THE LEAD 
LADIES IF ONE OF YOUR DOGS GETS LOOSE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SHOUT 
DOG LOOSE LOOSE DOG OR JUST GET IT OUT QUICK LOOSE DOG 
THAT'S IT THEN TRY AND RECOVER YOUR DOG AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN O. K. 
IF ONE OF THE NUTTERS GETS LOOSE AND YOU HEAR LOOSE DOG 
GET IN A KENNEL GET OFF THE GROUND GET OUT BUT DON'T RUN O. K. 
I'LL BE WITH YOU I'LL PROTECT YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT 
DOGS BARK CHECK IT 
HANG YOUR LEADS UP 
QUIET 
GOOD BOYS 
O. K. BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU NORMALLY GO OUT 
SHOPPING OR WORK OR WHATEVER WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY SAY 
DO YOU SAY ANYTHING BEFORE YOU GO YES I DO WHAT DO YOU SAY BEV 
I USUALLY SAY BE GOOD DOGGIES MUMMY WON'T BE LONG 
O. K. JUST IMAGINE THIS 
YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE ME ON MY OWN AND JUST BEFORE YOU GO YOU SAY 
I'M GOING NOW 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE 
EVERYTHING'LL BE O. K. AND THEN YOU GO OFF 
HOW BAD DO YOU THINK THE DOG FEELS 
COS HE'S THINKING OH FUCKING HELL WHERE'S SHE GOING 
IMAGINE IF WE JUST TAKE A LITTLE WALK UP HERE NOW WE JUST SLOWLY WALK UP HERE NOW 
THEY DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE COMING BACK OR NOT DO THEY NO 
THEY MIGHT THINK SHE'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE OR SHE MIGHT NOT BE BACK IN A MINUTE 
HOW MUCH BETTER IS THAT FOR THE DOG 
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A MOTTO AT DOG BORSTAL IF YOU CAN'T CARRY IT FUCKIN' LEAVE IT BEHIND 
COME ON THEN AT DOG BORSTAL THE DOGS COME FIRST 
FOR THE OWNERS TEMPORARY HOUSING HAS BEEN LAID ON 
THERE YOU GO MATE THAT'S YOUR ACCOMMODATION 
WHERE AM I GOING TO PUT ALL MY STUFF 
IN THE CAR 
YOU'RE FUNNY YOU ARE NOT YET 
WE HAVEN'T STARTED TRAINING YET 
LOOK AT THAT LOOK 
JUST BROKE MY FINGERNAIL LOOK OH 
WE BROUGHT TOO MUCH WE REALISE THAT ALREADY 
THAT IS JUST LITERALLY FULL OF SHOES AND BOOTS 
OFFICIALLY TRAINING HASN'T STARTED YET BUT NICK IS ALREADY ASSESSING THE OWNERS 
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS ALLOCATE ZERO TO FIVE POINTS FOR MOST OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO 
THIS MORNING THEY SCORED TWO DOUBLE ZEROS AND THAT WAS GETTING THE DOG OUT OF THE CAR WHICH WAS A SHIT ZERO 
AND GETTING THEMSELVES OUT OF THE KENNEL WHICH WAS ANOTHER ZERO LOOSE DOG 
IF THAT HAPPENS TOMORROW WE COULD END UP WITH A BLOODBATH 
COS THOSE DOGS ARE GOING TO RUN AT THE NEAREST DOG AND FIGHT 
I'VE EVEN BROUGHT MY CURLERS 
BACK AT THE KENNEL BLOCK BORSTAL TRAINER ROBERT ALAYNE IS WAITING FOR HIS NEW CANINE OFFENDER 
GOOD GIRL GOOD GIRL 
DOGS IN 
AMBER IS A RHODESIAN RIDGEBACK FROM NEWCASTLE 
AMBER THINKS SHE'S A HUMAN 
I DON'T THINK SHE THINKS SHE'S A DOG 
I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT 
AS YOU CAN SEE SHE'S QUITE ATTACHED TO ME 
SHE SITS ON THE COUCH SHE EATS WHAT WE EAT 
IF I SIT IN THE BATH SHE'LL ACTUALLY JUMP IN WITH ME 
AND AMBER'S DEMANDS FOR ATTENTION DON'T STOP THERE 
SHE IS MY SHADOW IF SHE GOES OUT OF SIGHT FOR A MINUTE SHE'LL BE STRAIGHT BACK 
IF I GO UPSTAIRS SHE'LL HAVE TO COME UPSTAIRS WITH ME 
SEE YOU LATER WHEN AMBER DOESN'T GET THE ATTENTION SHE WANTS THERE'S HELL TO PAY 
WHEN WE DON'T PLEASE AMBER SHE GOES CRAZY 
AND SHE BARKS UNTIL SHE GETS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS 
HIYA GOOD GIRL 
I ONLY WENT OUT FOR FIVE MINUTES AND SHE STARTED BARKING 
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT SHE'LL CONTINUE THAT NOW UNTIL I GET BACK 
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE UPSET AND IT GETS ME UPSET 
THE LAST PLACE WE LIVED AT WE GOT A LETTER FROM THE LANDLORD BASICALLY SAYING 
UNLESS WE STOPPED THE DOG FROM BARKING THEY WOULD EVICT US FROM THE PROPERTY 
OR WE HAD TO GET RID OF THE DOG WITHIN TWO WEEKS 
WHICH FOR A BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEM IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO RECTIFY 
THE VET SUGGESTED A LAST COURSE OF OPTION WAS TO HAVE HER VOCAL CORDS CUT 
WHICH AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IS ABSOLUTELY BARBARIC 
IT DOESN'T CURE THE PROBLEM THE DOG STILL GETS UPSET IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE A NOISE 
BUT GIVING IN TO AMBER AND TAKING HER EVERYWHERE ISN'T AN OPTION EITHER 
SHE'S PRETTY UNCONTROLLABLE WITH ME 
SHE WILL PULL ME ALONG AND IF SHE WANTS TO GO AND SNIFF A TREE SHE SNIFFS THE TREE AND I GO TOO 
BUT SHE DOESN'T DO THAT WITH YOU NO NOT AT ALL SHE'LL WALK NICELY 
I JUST CHECK HER ONCE ON THE CHAIN AND THEN SHE'S FINE 
COME ON HELL OH GOD HER LEAD'S 
COME HERE STOP IT NO 
GOOD GIRL 
ER WE'VE HAD A BIT OF AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN PULLING THAT HARD SHE'S ACTUALLY BROKEN HER LEAD 
I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE I CAN'T DO ANYTHING 
I FEEL LIKE I'M A PRISONER TO MY OWN PET 
SHE'S RULING OUR LIVES COMPLETELY 
WE'RE AT A POINT NOW WHERE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HAVING A FAMILY 
AND I CAN'T HAVE THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOUR GOING ON IF I'M PREGNANT AND I'VE GOT A CHILD IN THE HOUSE 
I CAN'T SO THE DOG WOULD HAVE TO GO 
FOR AMBER DOG BORSTAL IS THE LAST CHANCE 
BEHAVIOURAL EXPERT ROBERT KNOWS THAT THIS WILL BE A TOUGH CASE 
THE LIKELIHOOD IS THE DOG WILL GET WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER 
HE HAS A THING CALLED A SEPARATION ANXIETY 
WHICH MEANS THE DOG ISN'T COPING AT ALL WITH BEING LEFT ON HER OWN 
JUST BE QUITE CONFIDENT JUST WALK OUT DON'T APOLOGISE TO HER 
IT FINDS IT HARD TO COPE BEING LEFT IN ITS OWN ENVIRONMENT 
SO IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO FIND IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT 
BEING LEFT IN A STRANGE ONE BUT IT'S A CURABLE PROBLEM 
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE HARDEST BIT 
THE FACT THAT AT NIGHT SHE'S GOING TO BE IN THE KENNELS WHEREAS NORMALLY SHE'S WITH ME 
O. K. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY DOGS DEVELOP SEPARATION ANXIETIES 
IS BECAUSE THE OWNER SPENDS SO MUCH TIME WITH THE DOG 
AND THE DOG LOSES THE ABILITY TO COPE 
SO I KNOW THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU WANT AND I KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHAT AMBER WANTS 
BUT IT WILL BE BEST FOR HER 
I'M NOT GOING TO LIKE IT ACTUALLY BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY 
MY DOG'S NOT HAPPY AND IT'S CAUSING SO MANY PROBLEMS THAT 
IF IT MEANS THAT I HAVE TO JUST BITE THE BULLET 
AND GET USED TO THE FACT THAT THE DOG'S NOT GOING TO NEED ME SO MUCH I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT 
DUPLO AND ABBIE ARE SETTLING IN WELL 
TRAINER NICK IS USED TO WORKING WITH POLICE DOGS BUT HE WON'T BE DILUTING HIS DISCIPLINED TRAINING METHODS 
THAT'S THE MANUAL THIS IS A STANDARD DOUBLE TRAINING LEAD 
COR IT'S SO HEAVY THESE ARE YOUR BRUSHES THAT'S YOUR GROOMING BOX 
IF I ASK YOU TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU DON'T DO IT RIGHT YOU GET PUNISHED 
NORMALLY IT'S PRESS UPS AND SIT UPS HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
I DON'T MIND THE SIT UPS BUT CAN I DO LADIES' PRESS UPS THAT'S NO PROBLEM AT ALL 
THIS ISN'T REALLY ABOUT PUNISHMENT 
IT'S ABOUT YOU THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH YOUR DOG AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
SO WHEN YOU GO OUT ON THE STREET YOU AUTOMATICALLY DO WHAT I'VE TRAINED YOU TO DO 
BACK AT THE KENNEL BLOCK THE LAST CANINE INMATE IS ARRIVING 
HELLO PAV I'M DEBBIE CONNOLLY IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU THANKS FOR COMING 
FETCH 
RIO IS A TWO YEAR OLD WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD COME ON 
GOOD BOY SIT HE'S DEFINITELY AN OBEDIENT DOG HE'S VERY CLEVER VERY INTELLIGENT KNOWS LOTS OF COMMANDS 
RIO MAY BE SMART BUT HE HAS A BLIND SPOT 
VISITORS 
WHEN HE'S SEEING RED HE'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO CALL OFF 
IF SOMEBODY TURNED UP AND HE DIDN'T KNOW THEM AND I WASN'T HERE HE'LL DEFINITELY BARK AT THEM 
HE PROBABLY WILL ATTACK STAY 
RIO'S OWNER PAV HAS TRIED EVERYTHING AND HE'S RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS 
GET DOWN WE DO ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD DO TOWARDS A DOMINANT DOG 
FLIP HIM OVER ON TO HIS BACK AND HOLD HIM THERE SO HE'S UPSIDE DOWN 
WE EAT FIRST HE EATS AFTERWARDS ALWAYS TRY AND WALK THROUGH DOORS BEFORE HIM 
WHEN I SEE THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOUR IT'S QUITE UPSETTING AND WORRYING 
BECAUSE I THINK HE COULD ATTACK SOMEBODY HE COULD BITE SOMEBODY AND END UP BEING PUT DOWN HIMSELF 
RIO'S OWNER PAV IS PINNING HIS HOPES ON A WEEK IN DOG BORSTAL 
RIO'S TRAINER WILL BE NO NONSENSE NORTHERNER DEBBIE CONNOLLY 
WHO'S BEEN DEALING WITH AGGRESSIVE DOGS FOR TWENTY YEARS 
RIO'S BROKEN THE LAW ACCORDING TO THE DANGEROUS DOGS ACT 
IT'S DANGEROUSLY OUT OF CONTROL IN A PUBLIC PLACE 
THAT IS ENOUGH TO BREAK THE LAW 
UNLESS I GET THAT THROUGH TO THESE PEOPLE AND THEY ACCEPT THAT 
UNLESS THEY DO WHAT I SAY AND GET THE IMPROVEMENTS 
THE DOG WILL HAVE TO BE SEIZED AND DESTROYED AND THEY RISK THAT EVERY TIME THEY WALK THIS DOG 
HE'S A GOOD BOY STAY 
THAT'S FINE 
COMING O. K. 
I SHOULD'VE BROUGHT A BACKPACK REALLY SHOULDN'T I 
SOME HAPPY PUNTERS HERE ALREADY OF COURSE 
THIS THIRD ONE HERE IS YOURS 
I CAN TELL YOU'RE IMPRESSED YEAH 
BUT THE OWNERS HAVE NO TIME TO R. LA X. 
BORSTAL RUNS TO A STRICT TIMETABLE 
THE DOGS MUST BE FED AT SIX P. M. SHARP 
FEEDS ARE SUPERVISED BY TRAINER ROBERT 
I THINK FOR A FIRST TIME IN A STRANGE KENNEL IT'S AS WELL AS CAN BE EXPECTED 
I THINK SOME ARE COPING BETTER THAN OTHERS 
RIO I THINK IS COPING QUITE WELL 
TEAR YOURSELF AWAY 
BUT AMBER WHO HATES TO BE SEPARATED FROM HER OWNER IS FINDING IT HARD TO SETTLE IN 
DON'T WORRY SHE'S NOT GOING TO WANT TO EAT IT DON'T WORRY 
LOTS OF DEEP BREATHS 
AND HER OWNER DEBS IS FINDING IT EQUALLY DIFFICULT 
DON'T WORRY JUST TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES DON'T WORRY 
IT'S GOING TO BE A LEARNING CURVE FOR BOTH OF YOU SO 
IT'LL COME WITH TIME O. K. 
SORRY PLEASE DON'T APOLOGISE DON'T APOLOGISE 
I'M ALL RIGHT I JUST DON'T LIKE SEEING HER LIKE THAT 
YEAH YEAH AND IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE USED TO 
EVERY DAY YOU COME HOME YOU PUT HER FOOD DOWN SHE EATS IT 
THIS IS ABOUT AS ALIEN AS IT GETS 
BUT LOOK AT IT AS A MEANS TO AN END O. K. 
THIS IS NOT HER LIFE IT'S ONE WEEK OF HER LIFE AND ONE WEEK OF YOURS 
BUT YOU'LL HOPEFULLY ENSURE THAT FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE AND FOR THE REST OF YOURS WITH HER 
YOU WON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM AGAIN I'M DOING IT FOR THE DOG 
AND FOR YOURSELF FOR YOU AS A GROUP 
NOW ROBERT IS REALLY CONCERNED 
THE REASON WHY AMBER HAS A PROBLEM BEING WITHOUT DEBBIE 
IS BECAUSE DEBBIE IS INADVERTENTLY MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR AMBER TO COPE WITH BEING WITHOUT DEBBIE 
I THINK I NEED TO FIRSTLY GET DEB TO A POINT WHERE SHE CAN COPE WITH BEING SEPARATED FROM AMBER 
OTHERWISE I THINK THE CHANCES OF SUCCEEDING ARE MUCH MORE SLIM 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS ARE GOING TO BE TOUGH 
DUPLO AND ABBIE HAVE BEEN EXPELLED FROM DOG TRAINING CLASSES IN THE PAST 
CAN NICK'S TOUGH TRAINING STYLE BREAK THEIR ATTITUDE 
IF THE DOG'S LOOKED AT YOU GIVE HIM THE FOOD IF THE DOG'S LOOKED AWAY DON'T GIVE HIM FUCK ALL 
NO NO I'M NOT ALL RIGHT STOP 
RIO'S AGGRESSIVE STREAK HAS EARNED HIM A PLACE IN BORSTAL 
CAN TRAINER DEBBIE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF HIS PROBLEMS 
NO NO 
I DO WORRY THAT THERE'S A SNEAKING ENJOYING OF AN AGGRESSIVE DOG 
I'M NOT ONE TO GET ANNOYED BUT IF THERE'S SOME IDIOT IN A GIMP OUTFIT CALLING YOU THIS THAT AND THE OTHER 
PAV YEAH GET UP NOW 
AMBER'S OBSESSION WITH HER OWNER IS DESTROYING THEIR FAMILY 
CAN BORSTAL BEHAVIOURIST ROBERT PUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP ON A NORMAL FOOTING IN JUST ONE WEEK 
I FEEL LEFT OUT SAT HERE MY DOG WOULD RATHER BE WITH ANYBODY THAT 
FEEDS IT THAN ME AT THE MOMENT I KNEW THAT'D FUCKIN' HAPPEN 
IF WE DON'T AGREE WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHY I'M WRONG 
IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF TRAINING 
LAST NIGHT RHODESIAN RIDGEBACK AMBER SPENT HER FIRST NIGHT APART FROM OWNER DEBS FOR YEARS 
I TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS QUITE BIZARRE THAT I DIDN'T HAVE AMBER WITH ME 
I'VE NOT REALLY SPENT A LOT OF TIME APART FROM HER 
NORMALLY SHE SLEEPS IN THE BEDROOM IN A BASKET AND IT WAS VERY WEIRD NOT HAVING HER AROUND 
BUT IT WAS ALSO QUITE NICE ACTUALLY 
DEBS IS THE FIRST TO SET OFF FOR THE KENNELS BUT THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE AN EMOTIONAL REUNION 
ROBERT HAS INSTRUCTED DEBS TO IGNORE AMBER 
ACT AS THOUGH SHE'S NOT THERE AND WE'LL REWARD HER WHEN SHE'S CALMER 
I KNOW THIS WILL BE REALLY TOUGH FOR YOU BUT SHE'S GOING MUM IT'S BEEN HELL WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN 
AND WHAT YOU'D PROBABLY NORMALLY DO IS BEND DOWN AND GO 
GOOD GIRL I FOUND IT REALLY AWFUL TOO 
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GIVE HER THAT SIGNAL O. K. O. K. 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING DESPERATE TO GO DOWN AND DESPERATE YEAH 
O. K. I'LL CUT YOU SOME SLACK GIVE HER A BIT OF FUSS 
O. K. I WANT YOU TO BE LOUD GOOD GIRL GOOD GIRL 
DON'T APOLOGISE AND SOUND WHINING 
GOOD GIRL LOTS OF VOCALS GOOD GIRL O. K. 
JUST SHOW ME HOW YOU WOULD NORMALLY WALK HER THE WAY IN WHICH IT WOULD NORMALLY GO 
COME HERE STOP 
GOOD GIRL STOP IT 
SHE'S BASICALLY SAYING I'M GOING THAT WAY KEEP UP OR I'M UNHAPPY 
YEAH AMBER'S COPING WELL WITH THE LACK OF ATTENTION IT'S HER OWNER WHO CAN'T RESIST CONTACT 
SEE WHAT HAPPENED THERE THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING 
SHE WAS MOOCHING AROUND AND YOU WENT JUST LET ME HAVE A LITTLE FIX 
AND AS SOON AS YOU DID SHE WAS JUMPING UP SAYING MUM MUM YEAH 
SOMETIMES IT'S THE SIGNALS YOU'RE GIVING THAT ENCOURAGE THAT BEHAVIOUR 
NOW SHE'S STARTED JUMPING UP WHICH SHE WASN'T DOING BEFORE 
DON'T LET HER TAKE YOU SLOW DOWN 
IF SHE STARTS TO ACCELERATE I WANT YOU TO SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT 
TERRIERS DUPLO AND ABBIE ARE DUE TO HAVE THEIR FIRST TRAINING SESSION WITH NICK 
BUT IT'S NOT A PROMISING START 
SORRY WE'RE TEN MINUTES LATE WHAT TIME DOES THIS SAY EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY 
WHAT TIME IS IT NOW TWENTY TO NINE 
FORTY ONE YOU OWE ME ELEVEN 
GO OVER THERE AND DO 'EM ELEVEN 
DOWN YOU GO 
THE THING IS IT'S NOT ABOUT PUNISHMENT IT'S ABOUT GETTING THEM INTO A REGIME 
TRYING TO GET THEM INTO I'VE GOTTA DO THIS I'VE GOTTA DO THAT 
AND NO MATTER WHO'S TALKING TO THEM OR WHAT'S HAPPENING THEY'VE GOTTA DEAL WITH THEIR DOGS 
DUPLO AND ABBIE HAVEN'T BEEN WALKED IN IPSWICH FOR SIX YEARS 
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO BADLY BEHAVED 
BUT THEY'RE AT BORSTAL NOW 
I WANT YOU TO MEET MY DOG 
SANDY HE DOES A GOOD WAIT DOES AN EXCELLENT DOWN BUT FUCK ALL ELSE 
RIGHT SO YOUR FIRST BASIC POSITION WOULD BE 
WITH THE DOG ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE IN THE SIT 
HOLDING THE LEAD LIKE THIS 
AND THEN IF THE DOG DOESN'T GO INTO THE SIT 
RUN YOUR HAND DOWN AS FAR AS IT CAN GO FOLD THE LEAD UNDERNEATH AND HOLD THIS PART UNDERNEATH 
YOU GO LEFT YOU GO RIGHT SIT WHEN YOU GET TO ABOUT HERE 
COS THEN YOU CAN REINFORCE IT STRAIGHT AWAY IF HE DOESN'T 
SO IN THE SIT FACING THE FRONT PLEASE 
HE'S NOT CONCENTRATING NOW IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
GET YOUR LEFT HAND DOWN 
FOLD IT OVER NOW LEFT HAND DRAG HIM ROUND 
UP AT THE FRONT GOOD BOY 
IT'S BETTER THAN WHEN HE GOT OUT THE CAR YESTERDAY INNIT 
NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO IS DO IT WALKING 
SO WE ALWAYS DO COMMAND ACTION AND THEN PRAISE 
THE COMMAND IS FAIRLY GENTLE HEEL 
AND WE ALWAYS STEP OFF WITH THE LEFT FOOT 
THAT GETS THEM INTO A REGIME OF LOOKING UP WHEN THEY SEE THAT THEY GO 
WAIT AND THEN I GO OFF 
SO GET READY AND FORWARD AND OFF YOU GO 
THAT'S IT KEEP GOING 
THAT'S IT ROUND THE POLE 
AND THEN BACK TO WHERE WE ARE 
NORMAL PACE FORWARD HEEL THAT'S A GREAT HEEL COMMAND 
THAT'S IT 
NOW TURNING ABOUT ABOUT TO TURN ROUND YOU GO 
IF I SAID HERE'S TWO GRAND GIRLS YOU'RE IN BOND STREET YOU'VE GOT HALF AN HOUR 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WALK LIKE THIS ARE YOU THAT'S A BETTER THING 
AT NINE YEARS OF AGE DUPLO AND ABBIE ARE THE OLDEST DOGS IN THIS WEEK'S INTAKE 
BUT IT LOOKS AS IF THEY MAY BE THE FASTEST LEARNERS 
THAT'S A GREAT TURN KEEP IT GOING 
LOOKING GOOD 
I THOUGHT I'D GET A RESULT BUT THE AGE OF THE DOGS 
THE TYPE OF DOGS THEY ARE I DIDN'T THINK IT'D BE THAT QUICK 
I WANT A PHOTO THAT LOOKS GOOD 
TWO HANDLERS IN THE SIT WITH BOTH THE DOGS 
NORMAL PACE FORWARD GOOD BOYS 
JUST KEEP THAT PACE GOING GREAT 
RIGHT CRUFTS IS IN MARCH AND WE CAN PISS 'EM OFF THE BOARD WITH THIS 
VETERANS WE WILL RULE THE WORLD 
GET READY HALTING IN THE SIT DON'T DO ANYTHING FOLD IT OVER 
AND HALT 
SIT SIT 
REALLY BRILLIANT WE DONE SO MUCH THE DOGS ARE SO MUCH MORE HAPPY 
THEY'RE FULL OF ENERGY 
AND NOW THEY'RE GOING TO GO AND LAY DOWN FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS 
I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE A LAY DOWN AS WELL 
HOLD ON HOLD ON HOLD ON 
GOT ALL YOUR KIT BEV 
LEFT YOUR KIT BEHIND 
THAT'S A FIVE PLEASE BUT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
PUT THE DOGS IN THE DOWN AND HOLD THE DOG 
DO YOUR LITTLE PRESS UP THINGS AND AND 
IF YOUR DOG GETS UP EVERY TIME IT GETS UP YOU DO ANOTHER PRESS UP 
THAT'S A GOOD UN 
AND AGAIN KEEP DOING IT 
THAT'S IT GET THE FOOD 
KEEP HIM IN THE DOWN 
FEED YOUR DOG GREAT 
O. K. WELL DONE GIRLS SEE YOU LATER 
WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD RIO IS THE BAD BOY OF THIS WEEK'S DOG BORSTAL INTAKE 
BEFORE TAKING HIM ON DEBBIE NEEDS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT RIO'S BACKGROUND 
WE KNEW WE WANTED A WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD 
WE WERE PREPARED TO TRAVEL MILES WE WERE READY TO GO TO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND TO GET ONE HOW DREADFUL 
BUT THEN WE SAW AN ADVERT FOR A BREEDER THAT WAS VERY LOCAL TO US 
A LOCAL PAPER 
IN THE LOOT IN THE LOOT OH O. K. 
RIO'S PARENTS WERE BOTH AGGRESSIVE WE COULDN'T GET CLOSE TO THEM 
IT'S THE CLASSIC MISTAKE YOU'VE GOTTA SEE THE DOG'S PARENTS AND SEE THE TEMPERAMENT THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY 
DID YOU BELIEVE AT THAT POINT THAT IF YOU LOVED HIM ENOUGH 
AND WERE NICE ENOUGH TO HIM 
THAT YOU COULD INFLUENCE HIM DESPITE HIS BREEDING 
YES I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA THAT HE'D GROW UP TO BE AN AGGRESSIVE DOMINANT DOG 
BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE REALLY SHOULDN'T YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE 
FOR SAFETY RIO WILL BE TRAINED INSIDE A TWO METRE HIGH SECURITY CAGE 
I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOME OBEDIENCE AS PAV GIVES HIM TWELVE COMMANDS 
ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND JUST WAITS TO SEE WHICH ONE THE DOG PICKS 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT HIS HANDLING OF THE DOG HOW HE GIVES COMMANDS AND WHAT HE DOES 
RIO SIT 
RIGHT GO AND CORRECT HIM 
YOU CAN SEE THAT HE IS TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO 
HE CAN HEAR YOU COS HIS BODY IS REACTING AND HE'S THINKING 
NOW I REALLY SHOULD DO THIS I'LL LIE DOWN INSTEAD 
IF RIO IS GOING TO BE A SAFE PET HE HAS TO LEARN TO DO EXACTLY WHAT PAV SAYS 
HE'S GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS HABIT OF DOING HALF A JOB 
GET IN FRONT OF HIM AND BLOCK HIS LINE OF VISION KEEP HOLD OF THE LEAD THAT'S IT 
KEEP CORRECTING HIM DON'T LET HIM LOOK AT THAT RIO SIT 
KEEP IT CLOSE TOGETHER RIO SIT GOOD BOY SIT 
RIO SIT GOOD BOY SIT GOOD BOY SIT GOOD BOY RIO 
WHEN I SAY RELEASE HIM GO O. K. RIO SIT GOOD BOY AND RELEASE HIM 
O. K. AND MAKE A BIG FUSS OF HIM 
YOU CAN MOVE NOW YOU CAN COME TO HIM THAT'S FINE 
YES WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO TO MOVE HIM GOOD LAD 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT HIM THROUGH SOME OF THESE COS HE'S JUST TAKING THE MICKEY 
I THINK IT WENT REALLY REALLY WELL 
I WAS REALLY HAPPY WITH THAT IN JUST THAT SHORT SPACE OF TIME I SAW A DEFINITE IMPROVEMENT IN RIO THERE 
AND YEAH I WAS REALLY HAPPY WITH THAT 
BUT DEBBIE IS LESS OPTIMISTIC 
THIS IS A HANDLER PROBLEM 
THE DOG IS NOT THE BEST BRED SHEPHERD IN THE WORLD HE'S TOO HIGHLY STRUNG HE'S TOO NERVY 
PICK THAT LEAD UP AND GIVE HIM A YANK TELL HIM TO STOP IT NO 
I NEED THE HANDLER TO CONCENTRATE ON 
IF I SAY THIS I'M GOING TO TO FOLLOW IT THROUGH RATHER THAN SHOUTING RANDOMLY 
DOG IN DOG IN 
IT'S THE END OF A LONG DAY'S TRAINING 
AND THE OWNERS MUST EXERCISE THEIR DOGS BEFORE THEY BED DOWN FOR THE NIGHT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE DOGS WON'T UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH THEM 
IT'S NICE TO BE WITH PEOPLE THAT KIND OF UNDERSTAND 
THAT DON'T MAKE YOU FEEL A BIT A BIT LIKE A FREAK REALLY 
THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE IT'S A REAL MIXED BUNCH 
TWO LADIES BEV AND CHARLOTTE I THINK 
THEY KEEP THEMSELVES TO THEMSELVES A LITTLE BIT 
AND THEY SEEM QUITE SERIOUSLY INTO WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
BUT I SUPPOSE IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH MICK YOU KNOW YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT TO DO THAT 
BEFORE BAD DOGS DUPLO ABBIE RIO AND AMBER CAN LEAVE BORSTAL 
THEY'LL HAVE TO PASS THEIR TRAINER'S TEST 
AND THEY ALL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN 
ARE WE TRAINING THIS DOG OR ARGUING 
I KNEW THAT WOULD FUCKIN' HAPPEN 
IF IT WAS YOUR KIDS IN THE PARK YOU'D BE FUCKING HAPPY IF I'D FUCKING DONE WHAT I JUST DID 
IT'S BEYOND A FUCKING JOKE 
IT'S AN EARLY START BUT THE DOGS ARE ALREADY WIDE AWAKE 
BACK AT HOME IN NEWCASTLE AMBER HAS ALMOST HAD HER OWNERS EVICTED 
BECAUSE SHE BARKS CONSTANTLY WHEN LEFT 
BUT ROBERT THINKS AMBER CAN CHANGE 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE COLDITZ 
O. K. NOW FOR A FEW MINUTES I WANT YOU TO ACT AS IF SHE'S NOT HERE 
NORMALLY WHAT YOU WOULD'VE PROBABLYDONE IS STROKED HER 
SO NOW SHE'S STEPPING IT UP A LITTLE BIT AND SAYING NO YOU WILL GIVE ME SOME ATTENTION 
NOW SHE SAYS O. K. CAN I HAVE SOME FROM YOU 
SEE HOW MUCH SHE NEEDS THOSE LITTLE FIXES ALL THE TIME 
I'M QUITE SURPRISED I DIDN'T NOTICE HOW MUCH SHE ACTUALLY KEEPS DOING THAT 
MOST OWNERS WHO HAVE A SEPARATION ANXIETY 
IF THEY START TO RECORD IT THEY'LL FIND THE AVERAGE DOG PROBABLY DEMANDS ATTENTION ONE THOUSAND TIMES A DAY 
ROBERT'S GOING TO BRIBE AMBER TO BE MORE INDEPENDENT 
IF SHE COMES TO DEBS FOR ATTENTION SHE GETS NOTHING 
IF SHE WALKS AWAY SHE GETS A TREAT 
WHENEVER I SAY NOW I WANT YOU TO CLICK THAT AND GIVE HER A TREAT 
NOW 
GIVE HER THE TREAT AMBER 
GOOD GIRL THERE YOU GO 
MAKE NO MORE CONTACT 
O. K. NOW 
CALL HER TO YOU AMBER AMBER 
GOOD GIRL O. K. WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO NOW 
IS TAKE YOUR CHAIR AND PUT IT AGAINST THAT WALL 
ROBERT WANTS TO REINFORCE AMBER'S SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE 
HE'S USING FOOD AS A LURE 
GOOD GIRL IT'S REALLY WEIRD SITTING HERE AND WATCHING YOU 
WATCHING SOMEBODY ELSE FEEDING YOUR DOG 
AND I'M BEING COMPLETELY IGNORED AND I FEEL LEFT OUT SAT HERE 
I FEEL LIKE MY DOG WOULD RATHER BE WITH ANYBODY THAT FEEDS IT THAN ME AT THE MOMENT 
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET HER TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER THAN YOU 
GETTING HER WEANED OFF YOU A BIT AND YOU A LITTLE BIT WEANED OFF HER 
CALL HER TO YOU DON'T CLICK IT JUST CALL HER AMBER 
COME HERE AMBER GOOD GIRL 
AMBER COME HERE AMBER COME HERE JUST GOT TO SNATCH ONE MORE 
AMBER GOOD MAKE A FUSS OF HER WHEN SHE COMES BACK COME HERE WHAT ARE YOU UP TO GOOD GIRL 
IT'S A REAL BREAKTHROUGH FOR AMBER BUT HER OWNER'S NOT SO SURE 
I FEEL A BIT SPLIT ABOUT IT ACTUALLY 
COS I'M QUITE PLEASED THAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS IN HER BEHAVIOUR 
AND SHE'S NOT QUITE AS CLINGY AND THAT'S QUITE LIBERATING 
BUT I DO FEEL QUITE BAD 
WELL I FEEL A BIT BETRAYED BY HER ACTUALLY COS WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER 
AND I KNOW I'VE CAUSED THE PROBLEM WITH THE DOG BUT AS LONG AS I DON'T LOSE THAT BOND COMPLETELY 
COME ON AMBER 
STAR PUPILS DUPLO AND ABBIE HAVE ALSO MADE PROGRESS TODAY 
WE HAD A WONDERFUL TRAINING SESSION WITH MICK 
AND I CAME OUT OF THERE TWO HOURS LATER AND FELT SO SO HAPPY 
I HAD SUCH A WONDERFUL TRAINING SESSION WITH HIM HE IS A GREAT GUY 
EXCELLENT SESSION BRILLIANT 
REALLY GOOD REALLY GOOD 
JUST KEEP THAT UP IT WENT REALLY WELL THEY WERE REALLY ATTENTIVE 
AND I THINK THAT IF THINGS CARRY ON GOING LIKE THIS THEN WE WILL BE WINNING CRUFTS NEXT YEAR HOPEFULLY 
DOG IN BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO MAKE IT OUT OF DOG BORSTAL FIRST 
TODAY THE TENT GOT FLOODED AND ALL OUR BAGS WERE AT THE FRONT OF THE TENT AND THEY NEARLY GOT SOAKED 
LUCKILY WE WERE HERE AT THE TIME 
IF WE'D BEEN OUT TRAINING WE WOULD'VE COME BACK 
AND EVERYTHING WOULD'VE BEEN SOAKED ALL OUR CLOTHES 
BUT LUCKILY WE GOT THEM ON THE BED SLEEP WELL NO NOT SPEAKING TODAY 
WE HAD A BIT OF A BAD START THIS MORNING 
WITH ONE OF THE SHOWERS COS ONE OF THEM WAS COLD 
NO I'M NOT ALL RIGHT 
THIS IS BEYOND A FUCKING JOKE 
I GOT IN THE BLOODY SHOWER THIS MORNING AT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY 
AND GOT MY HAIR FULL OF SHAMPOO AND THE WATER WENT COLD 
THIS IS A FUCKING JOKE 
I TELL YOU I'VE HAD ENOUGH 
YEAH IT WAS A BIT OUT OF THE BLUE BECAUSE I THOUGHT EVERYONE WAS HOLDING TOGETHER QUITE WELL 
I'M SO ANNOYED WITH MY FUCKING SELF COS I'M SUCH A TOUGH GUY AND NEVER LET ANYTHING GET ME BEAT 
NEVER NEVER 
WELL I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU HAD TO PULL THE SWITCH 
TO GET THE ELECTRICITY GOING IN THE SHOWER BLOCK 
MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY WERE COLD I DON'T KNOW 
CAMERA CREW CAMERA CREW AS WELL GO WITH THEM 
BUT AT BORSTAL DOGS COME FIRST AND THE KENNELS MUST BE CLEANED 
WITH SPIRITS LOW IN THE CAMP MICK AND HIS ASSISTANT PAT 
DECIDE TO PUT ON A PROTECTION TRAINING DISPLAY 
THIS DOG IS NOT A PET 
HE'S TRAINED LIKE A POLICE DOG TO ATTACK ON COMMAND 
IT'S THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF DOG CONTROL 
I WOULDN'T LIKE THAT DOING THAT TO ME 
BUT NOT EVERYONE IS IMPRESSED 
NO HE DEFINITELY SHOWED GOOD CONTROL OF THE DOGS AND EVERYTHING 
BUT IT'S ALL STUFF THAT I'VE SEEN BEFORE 
AND YOU KNOW MY DOG CAN DO ALL OF THAT AND MORE YOU'RE A BRAVE MAN 
BUT THE TRAINERS ARE LESS IMPRESSED WITH PAV'S BRAVADO 
WHAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT PEOPLE WHO PERSISTENTLY DESCRIBE THEIR DOG AS BIG AND BOLD AND A POLICE DOG 
IN THAT SITUATION IS THAT I DO WORRY THAT THERE'S A SNEAKING ENJOYING OF AN AGGRESSIVE DOG 
DEBBIE DECIDES THAT PAV NEEDS A REALITY CHECK A ONE ON ONE TRAINING SESSION WITH MICK 
HE DOESN'T HOLD THE LEAD RIGHT 
O. K. HE'S NOT DOING A MILITARY COURSE BUT IF HE'S SLOVENLY STROLLING ALONG ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON 
HE PROBABLY DOES THAT WHEN HE DOES HIS DOG TRAINING 
HE'S WATCHING THE THINGS WE DO AND HE THINKS HIS DOG COULD DO THOSE THINGS 
IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
MICK WILL GIVE YOU SOME FEEDBACK TODAY WHICH I THINK WILL HELP YOU 
COME ALONG SIDE ME TAKE THE DOG 
DO YOU THINK HE'LL MAKE ME DO ANY PRESS UPS HE MIGHT 
O. K. SO I'M GOING TO GO OVER THERE AND DO A LITTLE ROUND WITH HIM SEE WHAT HE CAN DO 
FROM NOW ON EVERY TIME YOU STEP OFF SAY CLOSE 
EVERY TIME YOU TURN TO THE LEFT YOU SAY CLOSE 
EVERY TIME YOU TURN ABOUT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY 
CLOSE YEAH AND THAT'S IT 
TURN HIM ROUND FACE HIM THE OTHER WAY 
DO IT EXACTLY THE SAME AS DEBBIE TAUGHT YOU NORMAL PACE FORWARD 
O. K. STOP 
WHAT COMMAND ARE YOU GOING TO USE WHEN YOU STEP OFF 
YOU TOLD ME TO ONLY USE ONE AND WHAT COMMAND WAS THAT CLOSE 
AND WHAT COMMAND DID YOU USE I DIDN'T USE ANY 
RIGHT THAT'S TEN YOU OWE ME GET READY 
HE SAID HE'D MAKE ME DO PRESS UPS I WASN'T GOING TO DO ANY PRESS UPS FROM THE BEGINNING 
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO DO PRESS UPS AND STUFF I CAME HERE TO GET MY DOG TRAINED 
ABOUT TURN CLOSE 
SAY THE WORD THEN DO THE TURN 
TAKE THE LEAD IN A LITTLE BIT IF HE LOOKS AT YOU SAY GOOD BOY 
IF HE DOESN'T LOOK AT YOU DON'T SAY FUCK ALL IF HE SNIFFS THE GROUND GET HIS HEAD UP READY ABOUT TURN 
CLOSE GOOD BOY SAY IT NICELY 
IT'S TOO DEEP CLOSE 
SAY IT NICELY NOT IN A FUCKING BIG MACHO BULLSHIT WAY 
CLOSE GOOD BOY THAT'S MUCH BETTER 
LOSE TWO OFF YOUR TEN FOR THAT IT WAS A GOOD FUCKING TURN GOOD BOY 
DON'T SMILE YOU'RE NOT THAT GOOD TURNING RIGHT RIGHT TURN CLOSE 
YOU KNOW QUITE EARLY ON IN THE TRAINING SESSION 
HE'S HURLING INSULTS AT ME AND STUFF AND SAYING 
YOU'RE A TOSSER THIS AND THAT AND DON'T TURN LIKE THAT WHAT'S THAT 
CAN YOU DO A DOWN YES 
RIGHT HALTING IN THE DOWN 
HALT 
DOWN 
LIKE THIS DOWN NOT DOW W. WN WHAT THE FUCK'S THAT 
SOME VIKING FUCKING BOLLOCKS 
DOW WN LET'S TAKE EUROPE 
WHY IS HE LAYING IN FRONT OF YOU LIKE THAT 
ASK HIM I DON'T KNOW 
COS YOU'RE A TOSSER THAT'S FUCKING WHY 
HE WENT THERE THEN YOU STEPPED OVER HIM 
AND DID YOU WALK DOWN THERE WITH YOUR LEAD THROUGH YOUR LEGS 
PROBABLY AT ONE POINT 
I'M NOT GOING TO CO OPERATE WITH HIM IF HE'S GOING TO BE CALLING ME NAMES AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
IT'S COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED REALLY 
I DIDN'T EVEN DO MUCH WRONG 
DOWN STILL HASN'T DONE IT NORMAL PACE FORWARD WRONG FOOT 
IF HE CAN'T CONTROL IT JUST WALKING IN A STRAIGHT LINE IN A FIELD 
THEN HOW'S HE GOING TO CONTROL IT WHEN THERE'S PEOPLE AROUND 
HE'S GOING TO GET IN A LOT OF TROUBLE KEEP GOING ABOUT TURN 
THAT'S PLUS FIVE KEEP GOING SO HOW MANY'S THAT 
FIVE PLUS TEN WHAT'S THAT 
THIS ISN'T A MATHS CLASS YEAH I DIDN'T COME HERE TO BE INSULTED KEEP FUCKING GOING 
RIO'S OWNER IS CLOCKING UP A BORSTAL RECORD SO FAR HE'S EARNED FIFTEEN PRESS UPS 
WHY ARE YOU GETTING UPSET I'M NOT GETTING UPSET I'M GETTING ANNOYED WITH YOU 
I'M NOT ONE TO GET ANNOYED BUT IF THERE'S SOME IDIOT IN A GIMP OUTFIT CALLING YOU THIS THAT AND THE OTHER 
MATE DON'T FUCKING START 
YOUR TRAINING'S GOOD BUT I DON'T WANT THE INSULTS I'M NOT DOING PRESS UPS 
O. K. LET'S JUST FORGET TALKING ABOUT BOLLOCKS AND LET'S DO SOME DOG TRAINING ARE YOU UP FOR THAT 
I'M TELLING YOU NOW IF IT WAS YOUR KIDS IN THE PARK AND HIS DOG WENT OVER AND NAILED THEM 
YOU'D BE FUCKING HAPPY IF I'D FUCKING DONE WHAT I JUST DID 
OTHERS AT DOG BORSTAL HAVE BEEN TRULY CONVERTED TO MICK'S WAY OF THINKING 
MICK IS A REAL HARD TASKMASTER BUT HE'S SO GOOD AT HIS JOB 
I'VE GOT A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR THE GUY 
WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO WORK WITH HIM BECAUSE HE'S REALLY GOOD WITH OUR DOGS 
TO ME THEY'RE THE TWO MOST COMMITTED PEOPLE HERE AND THEY KNOW WHY THEY'RE HERE 
AND I KNOW WHY THEY'RE HERE AND BETWEEN THE TWO OF US WE'RE GOING TO GET A RESULT 
AND IF THE ONLY RESULT I GET OUT OF THIS IS IS THEM TWO I'M HAPPY 
GO DOWN ON TO ONE KNEE GO DOWN ON TO ONE KNEE FOOD 
GOOD BOY 
BRING HIM BACK WHERE PEOPLE GO WRONG THEY DON'T DO ANY OF THIS 
THEY GO STRAIGHT TO THE PARK LET THEIR DOGS OFF AND THEY RUN OFF 
OH WHAT A SURPRISE COS THEY HAVEN'T TRAINED IT O. K. LET'S GO 
TURN AND FACE YOUR DOG CALL HIM 
COME COME 
BEV AND CHARLOTTE'S COMMITMENT TO MICK'S TRAINING STYLE IS PAYING OFF 
TURN GET DOWN ON TO ONE KNEE COME ON COME ON GOOD BOY 
THIS IS A GREAT SESSION 
WE ARE NO NONSENSE PEOPLE WE DON'T LIKE TO BE PUSSY FOOTED ABOUT 
I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE A GUY THAT TELLS US WHAT IT IS STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE 
HE WANTS THIS HE WANTS THAT WE KNOW WHERE WE STAND WE'LL DO IT 
THEY HAVE PUT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT INTO THIS 
THEY'RE ALWAYS ON TIME THEY'VE GOT THEIR KIT ON 
THEY'VE GOT THE MANUAL THEY'VE GOT THEIR TOYS THEY'VE GOT THEIR FOOD 
THEY'RE HERE FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR DOGS 
BUT EVEN FOR STAR PUPILS MICK'S STANDARDS NEVER SLIP 
WATCH THIS BOYS OFF YOU GO 
DON'T LEAVE YOUR KIT BEHIND DON'T LEAVE YOUR DIARIES BEHIND DO YOUR NOTES 
BORSTAL IS WINDING DOWN FOR THE DAY AND FOR AMBER'S OWNER 
REINFORCEMENTS HAVE ARRIVED IN THE FORM OF HER HUSBAND PAT 
AMBI 
AS A WING COMMANDER IN THE R. A. F. PAT SEEMS UNFAZED BY THE QUARTERS AT BORSTAL WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IT'S A TENT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT I. S. 
HAVE YOU FENG SHUI'D IT AS WELL I HAVE 
I THOUGHT SO I'VE REARRANGED IT 
NO ONE CAN AFFORD TO RELAX 
BAD DOGS DUPLO ABBIE RIO AND AMBER HAVE JUST ONE MORE DAY OF TRAINING 
BEFORE THEY SIT THE TRAINERS' FINAL TEST 
GET YOUR ARSE IN GEAR YOU'RE LATE 
THE PRESSURE IS ON 
IF WE DON'T AGREE WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHY I'M WRONG 
HE'S TEN YEARS OLD HE'S GOING DOWN NO 
OH NO AMBI I WAS WORRIED THAT SHE'D DECIDED SHE WAS GOING 
AND THEN WE'D END UP WITH A BIG FIGHT AND A DEAD DOG 
IT'S THE FINAL DAY OF TRAINING 
AND AMBER'S OWNER DEBS IS ANXIOUS TO SHOW HER HUSBAND THE PROGRESS THEY'VE MADE 
BE A GOOD GIRL BYE BYE 
AT HOME AMBER ALWAYS GETS HER OWN WAY EVEN OUT ON THE LEAD IT'S AMBER WHO'S IN CHARGE 
SHE WILL PULL ME ALONG IF SHE WANTS TO GO AND SNIFF A TREE SHE GOES AND SNIFFS A TREE AND I GO TOO 
SHE'S A BIG DOG AND NOTHING WOULD UPSET ME MORE THAN TO SEE HER IN A FIGHT WITH ANOTHER DOG 
DOG OUT 
TRAINER ROBERT IS PLANNING TO CONFRONT THESE FEARS HEAD ON 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT HOW AMBER BEHAVES WITH OTHER DOGS 
DEB HAS SAID THAT SOMETIMES WHEN AMBER IS OUT WITH HER 
IF SHE SEES ANOTHER DOG SHE MIGHT RUN AT THE OTHER DOG SHE LOOKS INTIMIDATING TO THE OTHER DOG 
SO I'VE GOT ONE OF OUR STAFF HERE WHO'S GOT HER DOG WITH HER 
AND SHE'S GOING TO WALK HER DOG AT A DISCREET DISTANCE AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
A BIT CLOSE TO THE OTHER DOG SO YOU'RE NOW WALKING HERE GOOD GIRL 
SO NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS SHE'S MOVING AWAY FROM THE OTHER DOG 
AMBER AND DEBS MANAGE A COUPLE OF CIRCUITS OF THE FIELD SUCCESSFULLY BUT THEN DISASTER STRIKES 
NO OH NO AMBI AMBI HERE CALL HER BACK AMBER 
COME HERE SHE'S ALL RIGHT TRUDIE SHE WON'T BE AGGRESSIVE AMBER COME HERE AMBI AMBI 
COME HERE AMBI AMBI COME 
COME O. K. GOOD GIRL STAY 
SHE'S JUST SNAPPED THE CLIP SHE NOW DOESN'T HAVE A COLLAR 
I THOUGHT WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS RIGHT 
IT'S ALL TOO MUCH FOR DEBS I KNEW THAT WOULD FUCKIN' HAPPEN 
SHE SHOOTS OFF TO SEE ANOTHER DOG AND I DON'T WANT HER TO BUT SHE DOES ANYWAY 
FIRSTLY YOU HAVE MADE PROGRESS 
I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT TOMORROW I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT DOING IT 
IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOOKING EVERYTHING SHE'S DONE RIGHT 
OR THE ONE THING SHE DIDN'T DO AS RIGHT AS SHE COULD 
SHE GAMBLED OVER THERE WAS NOTHING THREATENING ABOUT HER WHATSOEVER 
SO THE WORST SHE DID THE WORST SHE DID WAS TAKE TWO RECALL COMMANDS 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S BAD O. K. 
TELL ME IF YOU DON'T AGREE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T AGREE WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHY I'M WRONG 
I'LL FINISH THE SESSION AND DO AS YOU SAY AND WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES FROM THERE 
I WAS WORRIED SHE'D DECIDED SHE WAS GOING AND WE'D END UP WITH A BIG FIGHT AND I'D END UP WITH A DEAD DOG 
SHE HAD A REALLY BAD SESSION THERE FROM HER OWN PERSPECTIVE 
SO WE HAD A BIT OF A TALK BUT EVEN AS WE WERE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION 
SHE WAS ALREADY STARTING BY HERSELF TO PUT THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE 
AS SO SHE'D ALREADY STARTED TO RECOGNISE THAT THIS HADN'T GONE AS BADLY AS SHE THOUGHT IT HAD 
AT HOME IN IPSWICH DUPLO AND ABBIE ARE DELINQUENTS ON THE LEAD 
ONCE THEY'VE STARTED I JUST CANNOT CONTROL THEM 
IT TAKES ALL MY STRENGTH TO HOLD THEM BACK 
NORMAL PACE FORWARD HEEL 
THEY MAY BE GETTING ON A BIT BUT THESE TWO HAVE QUICKLY LEARNED THAT GOOD BEHAVIOUR EARNS REWARDS 
BUT CAN THEY KEEP IT UP WHEN OTHER DOGS ARE AROUND 
MICK IS CONVINCED THEY ARE READY SO HE'S BROUGHT IN PAT'S HIGHLY TRAINED SECURITY DOG TO DISTRACT THEM 
FORGET THIS OTHER DOG YOU'VE GOTTA DO THIS NEXT WEEK WALKING DOWN THE STREET 
HEEL HALT AND THEN SIT HALT 
WHEN HE GOES THROUGH IF THE DOG'S LOOKED AT YOU GIVE HIM THE FOOD 
IF THE DOG'S LOOKED AWAY DON'T GIVE HIM FUCK ALL 
GET READY COME AGAIN PAT 
THEY ARE BOTH DOING WELL BUT EVEN WITH THE PROMISE OF A TREAT DUPLO CAN'T QUITE CONTAIN HIMSELF 
O. K. IT'S JUST OLD FUCK FACE HERE HANG ON 
MICK'S DECIDED IT'S TIME TO TEACH DUPLO A LESSON 
WE'VE TRIED THE FOOD IT HASN'T WORKED HE'S TEN YEARS OLD HE'S GOING DOWN 
NO 
THROWING WATER AT HIM WON'T HURT DUPLO BUT HOPEFULLY IT WILL TEACH HIM TO DO AS HE'S TOLD 
BACK DOWN ABOUT TURN 
WALK PAST HIM WITH THE DOG ON THE OTHER SIDE KEEP GOING HALTING IN THE SIT 
HALT SIT 
GOOD BOY FOOD 
YEAH I THOUGHT THAT EXERCISE WAS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
THE DISTANCE THAT WE NORMALLY PUT BETWEEN OURSELVES AND ANOTHER DOG IS TWO ROAD WIDTHS APART 
AND THAT IS PUSHING IT 
AT RIO'S HOUSE VISITORS ARE NOT WELCOME 
BARKS VICIOUSLY 
DEBBIE KNOWS THAT THE KEY TO CONTROLLING THIS BAD DOG 
IS FOR HIS OWNER TO COMMAND HIS COMPLETE ATTENTION 
BUT SHE'S STILL WORRIED ABOUT PAV'S PROGRESS 
PAV'S READ A LOT OF INFORMATION AND A LOT OF BOOKS 
IT'S DIFFICULT COS YOU ASK EVERYBODY AND READ EVERYTHING 
BUT YOU CAN END UP TRYING TO USE FOURTEEN DIFFERENT METHODS AT ONCE 
DEBBIE WANTS TO HONE IN ON JUST ONE METHOD FOR CORRECTING RIO 
THIS IS A SET OF TRAINING DISCS WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE ARE LIKE LITTLE BRASS CYMBALS ON A KEY RING 
THESE AREN'T OBJECTS OF FEAR I'M JUST GOING TO DROP THEM NEAR HIM 
THE DISCS BECOME THE DISCIPLINE NOISE AND THE DOG UNDERSTANDS THAT THAT NOISE MEANS MOVE BACK 
WALK A FEW STEPS AND THEN ACTUALLY JUST STOP JUST DROP THEM NEAR HIM 
DON'T SPEAK PICK THEM UP 
DROP THEM NEAR HIS HEAD 
PAV'S USED GADGETS IN THE PAST BUT THEY HAVEN'T WORKED 
PICK THEM UP 
THAT'S GOOD AGAIN 
THAT'S VERY CLEVER TWO ATTEMPTS AND HE KNOWS HE HAS TO SHUT UP AND MOVE THAT'S NOT BAD 
NOW RIO HAS LEARNED THAT THE DISCS MEAN GET BACK 
PAV CAN USE THEM TO MAKE RIO GET AWAY FROM A DOOR NOW NOW 
GET BACK DON'T SHOUT QUITE SO MUCH 
SOUND FIRM BUT NOT SHOUTING JUST MAKE IT A GET BACK 
TURN TO FACE HIM GET BACK 
GOOD BOY HE WAITED FOR THAT ONE 
THIS TIME TRY IT ON VOICE AND GESTURE 
GOOD BOY GET BACK 
GOOD BOY WAIT CALL HIM IN COME 
GOOD BOY THAT WAS GOOD 
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A WAY TO GO 
BUT THIS DOG REALLY COULD INJURE SOMEBODY SERIOUSLY IF IT ACTUALLY GOT TO THE DOOR 
AND TO A PERSON KNOCKING ON THE DOOR BEFORE THE PERSON COULD EITHER CONTROL THE DOG OR RESTRAIN THE DOG 
SO BIG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TODAY 
TOMORROW ALL THE DOGS WILL FACE THEIR FINAL TEST 
GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
EARLIER RHODESIAN RIDGEBACK AMBER SNAPPED HER COLLAR AND ESCAPED IN A TRAINING SESSION 
AND OWNER DEBS IS STILL TRYING TO REBUILD HER CONFIDENCE 
IT WAS NOT ANYBODY'S FAULT 
AND IN FAIRNESS TO AMBER SHE CAME BACK WHEN SHE WAS CALLED AND SHE WOULD NOT NORMALLY DO THAT 
BUT THERE'S THIS MADWOMAN GOING AMBER WHERE ARE YOU COME BACK 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON TO THAT 
I RECKON I WOULDN'T PUT IT ON A CAT 
LOOK AT THAT WHO DID THAT COME OFF

DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY BONES YOUR DOG SHOULD HAVE 
SHE HAS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY HOW MANY TEETH DOES YOUR DOG HAVE 
FORTY TWO TEETH TWENTY AT THE TOP AND TWENTY TWO AT THE BOTTOM 
VERY GOOD WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN A PUBLIC PLACE WHAT MUST YOUR DOG ALWAYS BE WEARING 
A COLLAR WITH A NAMETAG 
O. K. THAT'S GOOD SEVEN MAIN REQUIREMENTS A DOG NEEDS 
FEEDING WATER PACK 
LEADERSHIP AFFECTION

COME ON LET'S GO AND DO IT GOOD BOY 
RIO'S TEST IS SIMPLE 
DEBBIE IS GOING TO KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND SEE IF RIO CAN STAY CALM

GOOD GOOD BOY 
I HAVE ALL MY FINGERS GOOD LAD 
IT WAS A RESULT IN TERMS OF A TRAINING ENVIRONMENT AND AS REAL AS WE COULD MAKE IT 
BUT HOW CONSISTENT PAV'S GOING TO BE AT HOME REALLY REMAINS TO BE SEEN 
BEFORE BORSTAL DUPLO AND ABBIE ACTED LIKE HOOLIGANS WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN FOR A WALK 
HAS ONE WEEK WITH MICK BEEN ENOUGH TO TURN THESE TWO LITTLE DEMONS INTO ANGELS 
READY TO GO 
OWNERS AND DOGS NORMAL PACE FORWARDS HEEL 
MICK'S ASSISTANT PAT IS PUTTING THEM THROUGH THEIR PACES 
TURNING ABOUT ABOUT TURN 
AND MICK'S MARKING EVERY MOVE THEY MAKE 
HALTING IN THE SIT HALT 
NORMAL PACE FORWARDS HEEL 
TURNING ABOUT 
ABOUT TURN HEEL 
HALTING IN THE SIT 
JUST FIVE DAYS AGO AMBER FOLLOWED DEBS EVERYWHERE AND SHE BARKED THE HOUSE DOWN WHENEVER DEBS LEFT HER 
HAS ROBERT'S TRAINING BROKEN THE SPELL OF AMBER'S OBSESSION 
SEE YOU LATER BYE OFF YOU GO 
PAT YOU'RE JUST SIMPLY TO HOLD ON TO THE LEAD 
I DON'T WANT YOU TO SAY OR DO ANYTHING TO HER 
SO WE SIMULATE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SHE'S AT HOME 
UP THE BANK AND ROUND THE BACK OF THAT BUILDING O. K. 
AMBER WILL STAY WITH PAT WHILST HER BELOVED DEBS WALKS TOTALLY OUT OF SIGHT 
FIRST THING SHE'LL DO IS SHE'LL STAND UP TO GET A BETTER SHE'LL STAND YES 
NOW OF COURSE FROM WHERE SHE IS SHE MUST ONLY JUST BE ABLE TO SEE THE TOP OF DEBBIE'S HEAD 
I EXPECTED HER TO STAND UP I'M AMAZED THAT SHE HASN'T AT LEAST STOOD UP YET 
SHE'S NOW BEHIND THE BUILDING SO SHE CAN'T SEE HER 
THIS IS INCONCEIVABLE FOR HER YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY 
ON MONDAY DEB COULDN'T HAVE GOT TWO FEET AWAY WITHOUT AMBER SAYING THAT'S TWO FEET TOO FAR 
SHE'S NOW BEEN OUT OF SIGHT PROBABLY FOR FORTY FIVE SECONDS A MINUTE 
AND AMBER HASN'T EVEN STOOD UP 
HOW GOOD IS THAT IT'S A HUGE LEAP FORWARD FOR THE DOG 
HUGE I'M SO PROUD OF MY TEAM 
HAVE A NICE DAY AT THE OFFICE DEAR YES THANK YOU 
DID YOU EAT THE SANDWICHES I MADE FOR YOU YES THEY WERE NICE 
TUNA YEAH I LIKE TUNA IT'S PRETTY COOL AS WELL 
DEB GIVE HER A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FUSS 
GOOD GIRL YES YOU ARE 
WHO'S BEEN A REALLY GOOD GIRL 
NOW I HOPE YOU CAN DO THAT AT HOME 
THAT'S THE ACID TEST I HOPE SHE CAN DO THAT AT HOME 
BUT LOOK AT HER NOW I KNOW SHE DOESN'T LOVE ME ANY MORE 
NO SHE DOES WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU TALK TO HER SHE WAS LIKE 
SO NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP 
WE'VE JUST MANAGED THE WAY THAT SHE BEHAVES SO IT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
ACROSS THE CAMP DUPLO AND ABBIE'S TEST IS NEARING ITS END 
TO SUCCEED THEY STILL HAVE TO WALK PAST DES THE STOOGE DOG WITHOUT LOSING CONTROL 
O. K. EXERCISE COMPLETE 
YAY GOOD GIRL 
THAT WAS TIGHT WEREN'T IT 
MICHELLE GOOD USE OF THE LEAD NICE LITTLE FOLD OVER 
NICE USE OF THE HAND AND THE SIT POSITION I GAVE YOU FIVE OUT OF FIVE 
BEVERLEY OVERALL OBEDIENCE TODAY WAS FIVE OUT OF FIVE 
LEFT RIGHT ABOUT TURNS FIVE OUT OF FIVE GOOD CONTROL ON THE LEAD EIGHTY FOUR PER CENT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'VE QUALIFIED THANK YOU 
AS MICK PREDICTED THIS WEEK'S STAR PUPILS PASSED WITH FLYING COLOURS 
YEAH I THOUGHT THEY WERE EXCELLENT IF I HAD PEOPLE LIKE THAT ON EVERY COURSE I EVER TOOK PET TRAINING 
OR WHATEVER TRAINING I'VE DONE UM YOU KNOW I'D BE REALLY HAPPY 
GREAT ATTITUDE TO THE TRAINING GREAT ATTITUDE TO THE WAY I TRAIN 
AND I THINK THEY MUST BE HAPPY WITH THEIR ACHIEVEMENT 
DUPLO AND ABBIE RIO AND AMBER HAVE SUCCESSFULLY GRADUATED FROM THEIR WEEK IN BORSTAL 
BUT TWO MONTHS DOWN THE LINE ARE THEY STILL REFORMED CHARACTERS 
WAIT 
GOOD DOGS 
DUPLO AND ABBIE'S BEHAVIOUR IS VASTLY IMPROVED AND THEIR DOGS NOW GO FOR A WALK EVERY DAY 
THEY'RE SO HAPPY WITH IT AND I'M SO HAPPY WITH IT AS WELL 
AND IT'S JUST GOING FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH 
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE THEM SO HAPPY AND THEY'VE GOT THAT SPARKLE IN THEIR EYE 
I THINK THE NEXT THING I MIGHT TRY ONE DAY IS TO LET ONE OF THEM OFF THE LEAD JUST TO SEE IF THEY COME BACK 
IN MILTON KEYNES THERE IS ONE DOOR THAT IS NOW MUCH SAFER TO KNOCK ON 
I WISH I'D COME ACROSS DEBBIE OR SOMEONE LIKE DEBBIE EARLIER 
I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY THAT SHE CHANGED HIM 
GOOD BOY GOOD DOG 
BUT IT'S UP TO ME TO MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T KIND OF LEAVE IT OR FORGET ABOUT IT 
OR SLIP INTO OLD ROUTINES 
BYE SEE YOU LATER 
AND IN NEWCASTLE AMBER'S OWNER IS NOW FREE TO COME AND GO AS SHE PLEASES 
SHE'S JUST A MILLION TIMES BETTER IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT AND I'M A LOT HAPPIER 
I'M NOT STRESSED I DON'T GET UPSET WHEN I LEAVE THE DOG 
AND THE DOG DOESN'T GET UPSET OR STRESSED WHEN I LEAVE IT NOW SO I'VE GOT A HAPPIER DOG 
WE'RE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH HER AND SHE'S MORE COMFORTABLE WITH US 
AND I THINK WE'RE ALL A LOT HAPPIER AS A RESULT 
EVERYBODY'S GETTING TOGETHER BLACK WHITE FAT THIN 
SEXY UGLY WELL MAYBE NOT UGLY
