IT'S BEEN A STRANGE SPRING THIS YEAR 
IT STARTED OUT VERY EARLY 
THEN WE HAD THAT BLAST OF WINTRY WEATHER OVER EASTER 
BUT IT'S HERE NOW AT BERRYFIELDS YOU CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR AS WELL AS SEE IT ALL AROUND YOU 
THE WORLD RENEWING REFRESHING ITSELF ALMOST BY THE MOMENT 
GARDENERS' WORLD HAS RENEWED ITSELF TOO 
WE'VE GOT NEW TITLES FRESH MUSIC JOE'S TAKING ON A NEW ALLOTMENT 
CAROL'S GOT A NEW PROJECT DOWN IN DEVON AND HERE AT BERRYFIELDS 
YES WE WILL BE DOING SOME NEW THINGS BUT ALSO JUST CELEBRATING 
EVERY WEEK THOSE ASPECTS OF GARDENING THAT NEVER CHANGE 
HELLO WELCOME TO GARDENERS' WORLD AND WELCOME TO THE SPRING GARDEN 
LOOKING AS GOOD AS I'VE SEEN IT 
THIS WAS MADE FIVE YEARS AGO AND EVERY YEAR IT'S GOT A BIT BETTER 
AND IT'S MORE GLORIOUS THAN EVER AND ALSO THIS IS ITS MOMENT 
THIS IS THE VERY PEAK OF THESE SPRING PLANTS 
AS WELL AS ESTABLISHED PARTS OF THE GARDEN LIKE THE SPRING GARDEN 
WE'VE GOT NEW PROJECTS THIS YEAR THE BOG GARDEN 
WHICH WE WANT TO DEVELOP THAT'S ON HOLD 
BECAUSE OF GREAT CRESTED NEWTS THAT ARE BREEDING THERE SO THAT'LL HAPPEN LATER THAN PLANNED 
WE'VE GOT THE NECTAR GARDEN THE ORCHARD WHICH WE'VE BROUGHT ON 
THE FRUIT CAGE MASSES TO DO 
AND I'LL BE HERE AT BERRYFIELDS HELPED BY ALYS WHO'LL ALSO HELP WITH MAINTAINING THE GARDEN 
AND WE'LL BE LOOKING AFTER BERRYFIELDS 
THE THINGS THAT OVER THE YEARS WE'VE DEVELOPED AS CAREFULLY AS WE CAN 
ENJOYING AND CHERISHING THEM AS WELL AS THE NEW PROJECTS 
ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME I TAKE A LOOK AT THE LONG BORDERS 
ASSESSING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND PLANTING SOME DELPHINIUMS 
TO INJECT SOME BLOOM INTO THE COLOUR SCHEME 
I'M ALSO PLANTING BLACK RED AND WHITECURRANTS INTO OUR FRUIT CAGE 
AND I'LL SOW THE SEEDS FOR OUR COSMOS TRIAL 
JOE IS STARTING HIS BIG ALLOTMENT ADVENTURE 
CAROL KICK STARTS HER GREEN GARDEN BY TAKING CUTTINGS 
FROM HER FAVOURITE PLANTS SHE'S GROWN HERE AT BERRYFIELDS 
I KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN GROWING THE SAME SWEET PEAS THAT WE HAVE 
THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT COMMEMORATE THE PRESENTERS OF GARDENERS' WORLD 
PERCY THROWER 
GEOFF HAMILTON IS NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE 
ALAN TITCHMARSH AND ALSO MONTY DON 
WHICH WAS INTRODUCED THIS YEAR 
AND THOUGH NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE SOME OF YOU HAVE GOT IT 
IT'S TIME FOR US TO PLANT THEM OUT HERE IN THE FORMAL GARDEN WHERE THEY'LL LIVE THROUGHOUT SUMMER 
I WOULD JUST SAY IF YOU HAVEN'T YET HARDENED OFF YOUR SWEET PEAS 
DON'T PLANT THEM OUT YET GIVE THEM TEN DAYS TO ACCLIMATISE 
IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT TO DO THAT 
AND IF YOU HAVEN'T SOWN ANY AT ALL IT'S NOT TOO LATE 
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO SOW THE SEEDS DIRECTLY INTO THE SOIL 
AND THE FLOWERING WILL BE A MONTH OR SO LATER 
ANYWAY WE'RE READY TO GET THEM INTO THE GROUND 
THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF SWEET PEAS 
IS THAT THEY NEED RICH SOIL AND LIKE LOTS OF MOISTURE 
SO I LIKE TO DIG A PIT AND THEN ADD PLENTY OF ORGANIC MATERIAL 
EXACTLY THE SAME AS IF YOU'RE GROWING RUNNER BEANS 
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A GENEROUS PLANTING HOLE 
BUT THE POINT IS NOT TO TAKE THE PLANTS 
BUT TO ACT AS A SUMP TO TAKE THE ORGANIC MATERIAL I'M PUTTING IN 
AND THAT WILL HOLD MOISTURE 
YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS ROUGH COMPOST MADE LARGELY FROM THE GRASS FROM THE MEADOW 
THAT DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL 
WHATEVER YOU'VE GOT GARDEN COMPOST MANURE EVEN OLD NEWSPAPER HELPS 
BECAUSE SWEET PEAS DO NOT LIKE TO GET TOO DRY 
AND THEY REALLY SUFFER I'M JUST PUTTING IN A GOOD LAYER LIKE THAT 
SO THE SOIL I'VE TAKEN OUT OF THE HOLE GOES BACK OVER 
AND IF IT MAKES A SLIGHT MOUND THAT DOESN'T MATTER 
BUT AS EVER WITH GARDENING WHAT HAPPENS UNDERGROUND 
IS PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT HAPPENS ABOVE GROUND 
THAT IS WHERE THE SUCCESS OF OUR SWEET PEAS WILL LIE 
NOW THE NEXT PHASE IS TO GIVE THE SWEET PEAS SOME SUPPORT 
THEY'RE CLIMBING PLANTS AND WILL GROW TO ABOUT FIVE TO SIX F. T. TALL 
AND THEY NEED SUPPORT ALL THE WAY UP THAT HEIGHT 
YOU CAN DO IT AGAINST TRELLIS ON WIRE ON BAMBOO 
WHAT I'M CHOOSING TO USE HERE 
ARE HAZEL COPPICE STICKS 
MAINLY BECAUSE I'M A FAN OF HAZEL I LOVE IT 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE MATERIAL IS 
BUT I'D SUGGEST IT'S A GOOD IDEA IF YOU USE SOMETHING SUSTAINABLE 
EITHER THAT YOU BUY LOCALLY FROM A LOCAL WOOD 
OR IDEALLY YOU CUT FROM YOUR OWN GARDEN 
IF YOU'VE GOT ANY NICE DECENT STRAIGHT STEMS FROM ANY PLANT 
OR PRUNING SAVE IT AND USE IT FOR SUPPORTING PLANTS 
SO THOSE ARE IN NICE AND FIRMLY 
AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET THEM REALLY FIRM 
AND THEN JUST TIE THEM UP AT THE TOP 
O. K. 
RIGHT THAT'S GOOD AND FIRM 
NOW I'M GOING TO START PLANTING MONTY DON 
AND I TELL YOU WHAT HE'S A BIT LANKY 
IF YOU'VE GOT PLANTS LIKE THAT AND I HAVE PINCHED THEM OUT ONCE 
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE PINCHED OUT BEFORE PLANTING 
IT MAY SEEM COUNTER INTUITIVE THAT YOU'RE THROWING AWAY HEALTHY GROWTH BUT YOU'RE NOT 
YOU'RE PUTTING THE ENERGY OF THE ROOTS INTO LESS TOP GROWTH 
AND YOU'LL GET A MUCH HEALTHIER PLANT AS A RESULT 
THERE YOU ARE NICE ROOT SYSTEM 
AND ALL I DO IS PLANT IT AT THE BASE 
AND I'LL PLANT JUST ON THE INSIDE THERE 
QUITE DEEP FIRM IT DOWN 
AND THAT WILL HAVE TO BE TIED IN AND TRAINED UP 
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT 
I'M IN THE GREEN GARDEN PLANTING THIS GREEN SWEET PEA FOR MONTY 
IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE SWEET PEAS MONTY'S PLANTING 
BECAUSE IT'S A SPECIES SWEET PEA FROM TURKEY LATHYRUS CHLORANTHUS 
IT'S FOUND ON THE BANKS OF STREAMS AND ALONG WAYSIDES AND WASTELANDS 
IT HAS DIFFERENT GROWING CONDITIONS IT GROWS IN VERY STONY ROCKY PLACES 
SO IT NEEDS WELL DRAINED SOIL AND A QUITE AIRY SUNNY LOCATION 
SO I'M HOPING IT'S GOING TO COVER THIS WALL IN A REALLY PRETTY WAY 
I'M JUST ADDING SOME GRIT INTO THE PLANTING HOLE 
JUST TO MAKE SURE I'VE GOT REALLY GOOD FREE DRAINING CONDITIONS 
AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL TAKE OFF 
IT WAS QUITE SLOW TO GERMINATE IN THE AUTUMN SO I THINK 
TO SOW IT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR YOU NEED TO BE PATIENT BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME TO COME 
ONCE UP IT'S A VERY STRONG GROWING PLANT SO IT SHOULD TAKE VERY QUICKLY 
MOST OF THESE I'VE PINCHED OUT SO THEY'RE SHORT AND STUBBY 
BUT I'VE LEFT ONE UN PINCHED OUT 
JUST TO SHOW YOU THAT AS THEY START TO GROW 
THEY WILL NEED TYING IN 
I LIKE TO USE A SOFT TWINE 
THAT DOESN'T DAMAGE THE TISSUE OF THE PLANT 
KEEP IT SUPPORTED ALL THE WAY UP PROBABLY FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS 
UNTIL THE TENDRILS WRAP THEMSELVES AROUND THE SUPPORT 
THAT'S THE SORT OF JOB YOU DO SLOWLY LISTENING TO THE RADIO 
THIS YEAR THERE ARE GOING TO BE CHANGES HERE AT GARDENERS' WORLD 
AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST IS THAT CAROL WILL BE EVERY BIT AS MUCH PART OF THE PROGRAMME AS BEFORE 
BUT NOT SO MUCH TIME AT BERRYFIELDS 
BECAUSE SHE'S BASING HERSELF FROM HER OWN GARDEN IN DEVON 
DOING WHAT SHE DOES BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE RAISE PLANTS 
AND ALSO DEVELOP A GARDEN THAT IS ENVIRONMENTALLY AND ECOLOGICALLY 
AS SOUND AS IT POSSIBLY CAN BE 
GARDENING'S AN EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS 
THIS PLOT WAS PRACTICALLY BARREN WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE THIRTY YEARS AGO 
BUT IT'S REALLY CHANGED SINCE THEN 
I'VE FILLED IT WITH PLANTS WHICH I'VE BEGGED BORROWED STOLEN 
WELL I'VE NEVER STOLEN THEM 
BUT I'VE LOVINGLY RAISED THEM MYSELF OVER THE YEARS 
FIRST OF ALL IT WAS A NECESSITY BUT NOW IT'S JUST SECOND NATURE 
THERE'S NOTHING DIFFICULT OR STRANGE 
OR OUTLANDISH ABOUT GROWING A GREEN GARDEN 
IT REALLY IS JUST A QUESTION OF EMULATING NATURE 
LOOKING AT THE WAY NATURE DOES THINGS OBSERVING THINGS AND GOING WITH THE FLOW 
YOU LOOK AROUND SEE WHEN THE SEEDS ARE RIPE AND PLUCK THEM FROM THE PLANT JUST AT THAT POINT 
SOW THEM STRAIGHTAWAY SO JUST GOING ALONG WITH THE WAY THAT THINGS WORK 
AND IT'S NOT AS THOUGH IT WAS SOMETHING NEW OR DIFFICULT AT ALL 
IT'S THE WAY WE'VE BEEN GARDENING FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
IT'S A VERY JOYOUS PROCESS 
BEING IN TUNE WITH THE SEASONS IS ESSENTIAL WHEN YOU GROW YOUR GREEN GARDEN 
IT'S AS CRUCIAL AS THE SOIL AND AS VITAL AS WATER 
SEVENTY PER CENT OF PONDS 
THAT USED TO BE A FEATURE OF EVERY VILLAGE YOU'D FIND THEM IN FIELDS THEY'VE GONE 
THAT'S WHY URBAN AND SUBURBAN GARDENS ARE THE PERFECT PLACES NOW 
TO KIND OF REPLACE THAT VANISHED HABITAT 
THIS IS A REALLY MOMENTOUS DAY 
I'M GOING TO MAKE A POND 
WHEN WE FIRST CAME HERE I MADE ONE FURTHER UP THE GARDEN 
THE KIDS LOVED IT THEY ABSOLUTELY ADORED IT 
THEY SPENT LOADS OF TIME THERE AND THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF FANTASTIC CREATURES THAT IT ATTRACTED 
I SUPPOSE IT'S A RATHER ODD SHAPED POND 
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE A GREAT CARROT 
IT'S GOING TO BE THIS LONG TRIANGULAR SHAPED POND 
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS TO FIT YOUR POND INTO THE SHAPE YOU'VE GOT 
THERE'S NO RULE BOOK ABOUT ALL PONDS HAVE TO BE KIDNEY SHAPED OR ROUND 
I'M SO LUCKY HERE BECAUSE I'VE GOT THIS WONDERFUL WATTLE FENCE 
AND THIS FABULOUS NATIVE HEDGE RUNNING RIGHT THE WAY DOWN HERE 
IT'S REALLY GOING TO LURE THINGS IN FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE AROUND 
I'VE HARDLY GOT ANY NEED TO DIG 
YOU CAN TELL JUST BY THE LOOK OF IT 
IT'S REALLY REALLY HEAVY CLAY 
BUT IT'S IDEAL FOR DIGGING OUT THIS POND 
LOOK AT THIS IT'S THE SORT OF STUFF 
THAT POTTERS COULD USE DIRECT IT'S COMPLETELY SOLID AND MOULDABLE 
PERFECT FOR DIGGING THIS POND 
WHENEVER YOU'RE INITIATING NEW PROJECTS OR CREATING NEW HABITATS 
IT'S IMPERATIVE TO RECYCLE MATERIALS IN OTHER PLACES 
THE GRAVEL FROM HERE CAN BE USED TO TOP UP PATHS ALL AROUND THE GARDEN 
THIS SEEMS TO ME THE MOST AMAZING OPPORTUNITY YES I THINK IT IS 
IT JUST SORT OF EMBODIES ALL THOSE 
ALL THOSE REASONS YOU GARDEN IT USES ALL THE WAYS YOU DO GARDEN 
THE THING THAT'S ALWAYS REALLY ENTHUSED ME IS THE WHOLE IDEA OF GROWING PLANTS 
I MEAN THE FACT THAT YOU CAN TAKE A SEED OR A CUTTING OR WHATEVER IT IS 
AND YOU CAN GROW YOUR WHOLE GARDEN THAT WAY 
I LOVE THE WAY YOU SAY THIS IS NOT A NEW FAD IT'S NOT TRENDY 
IT'S RIGHT AT THE CORE OF ALL GOOD GARDENING AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN 
IT'S THE WAY PEOPLE HAVE GARDENED FOR EVER 
IT'S JUST EMULATING NATURE REALLY JUST FOLLOWING WHAT HAPPENS 
YOU'LL BE GATHERING SOME STOCK HERE FROM BERRYFIELDS IF YOU LET ME 
ABSOLUTELY IT'S YOUR GARDEN TOO BUT YOU'LL BE PUSHED TO GET INTO THE POND 
I HAD HOPED I'D BE ABLE TO TAKE A FEW THINGS FROM HERE 
BUT I GATHER I'M NOT NO WE'RE NEWTED OUT 
ALL RIGHT THE NEWT POLICE HAVE SAID THE NEWTS ARE BREEDING WE CANNOT DISTURB THEM IN ANY WAY 
SO WE CAN'T GET AT IT YOU CAN'T GET AT IT BUT THERE IS ONE POND PLANT I CAN TAKE 
A LOVELY EUPHORBIA IN THAT GARDEN FROM SEEDS CUTTING AND DIVISION 
BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER THINGS TOO NO TAKE EVERYTHING AND KEEP COMING BACK TOO 
WELL I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ANYTHING FROM THE POND 
BUT THERE ARE STILL A FEW PLANTS ESPECIALLY IN THIS GARDEN FROM CUTTINGS SEED AND DIVISION 
WHICH WILL REALLY LEND THEMSELVES TO GROWING BESIDE MY POND 
IT'S EUPHORBIA PALUSTRIS 
AND PALUSTRIS JUST MEANS LIVING IN A STREAM 
SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO REALLY ENJOY LIFE BETTER BY MY POND 
BUT IT'S REALLY THRIVING IN HERE 
THE REASON I'M NOT JUST TAKING CUTTINGS FROM THIS IS 
IT'S GOT THIS VERY HARD SOLID KIND OF ROOT 
YOU'D HAVE TO TAKE A CHAINSAW TO IT 
ALSO YOU'VE GOT TO BE TREMENDOUSLY CAREFUL WITH EUPHORBIAS 
BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE THIS SAP WHICH IS A REAL SKIN IRRITANT 
LOOK AT THAT IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
THERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS TOO I WANT OUT OF HERE 
FOR A QUITE DIFFERENT PART OF THE GARDEN 
I'M LONGING TO HAVE SOME CUTTINGS OF THIS 
THIS DIANTHUS HAS ALREADY MADE A JOURNEY IT STARTED ITS LIFE 
IN THE COTTAGE GARDEN 
WE TOOK CUTTINGS AND TRANSPLANTED SOME OF THEM HERE 
THAT'S THE THING ABOUT DIANTHUS 
THEY'RE THOSE SORT OF PLANTS THEY'RE PASSED DOWN THROUGH GENERATIONS THROUGH CENTURIES 
THIS IS GOING TO BE IDEAL IN ONE OF THE HOT DRY PLACES IN MY GARDEN 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS 
OF TAKING DIANTHUS CUTTINGS AND YOU CAN DO AT ALMOST ANY TIME OF YEAR 
YOU CAN GET RIGHT IN THERE AND JUST DETACH A PIECE LIKE THAT 
NOW YOU CAN SEE THERE THERE'S A BIT OF THE STEM 
AND IT'S GOT THIS HEEL ON IT BUT IT'S RATHER LONG IT'S GOT SEVERAL JOINTS TO THIS BIT IT'S TOO LONG 
TAKE YOUR KNIFE A SHARP KNIFE AND CUT RIGHT UNDER ONE OF THESE LEAF NODES HIGHER UP 
PEEL A FEW LEAVES OFF AND DIBBLE THEM ROUND THE EDGE OF A POT 
OR YOU CAN DO THIS RATHER SPLENDID THING THESE ARE CALLED PIPINGS 
YOU GET THE PLANT AND JUST CAREFULLY PULL LIKE THAT 
IT COMES OUT AT THAT LEAF NODE 
YOU CAN TAKE THOSE LEAVES FROM AROUND THE BASE 
AND NIP OUT THE TOP AND THEN JUST DIBBLE THESE AROUND THE EDGE OF THIS POT OF 
IT'S VERY GRITTY COMPOST THIS AND IT'S IDEAL FOR THAT 
I'M SURE THOSE ARE GOING TO DO REALLY WELL WHEN THEY GET THEM HOME 
THE THIRD THING I WANT TO TAKE IS SEED 
I MUST FROM THIS GARDEN MUSTN'T I 
I'M GOING TO USE THIS RATHER SORRY LOOKING SPECIMEN 
IT'S AN IPOMOEA IT'S DEEP DEEP PURPLE 
I CAN REMEMBER WHEN ALL THESE FENCES RIGHT THE WAY ROUND 
WERE COVERED IN THESE SHEETS OF GREEN AND PURPLE MAGNIFICENT 
AND FORTUNATELY FOR ME THERE'S SOME LEFT 
IT WILL HAVE STORED ITSELF PERFECTLY HERE 
EVEN BETTER THAN TAKING IT IN THE AUTUMN AND PUTTING IT IN A PACKET 
AND YEAH IT'S ABSOLUTELY FULL OF THESE LOVELY BLACK SEEDS 
I'LL HAVE NO NEED TO SOAK THEM I'LL BE ABLE TO SOW THEM DIRECT 
I'M JUST GOING TO COLLECT AS MANY OF THOSE AS I CAN VERY GREEDILY 
THERE THEY ARE I'VE GOT MY SEED I'VE GOT MY DIANTHUS 
ALL I NEED IS MY EUPHORBIA AND I'M OFF 
AND OF COURSE WE'LL BE FOLLOWING CAROL'S ADVENTURES AS HER GARDEN AND HER PROTEGE'S GARDEN EVOLVE 
TALKING OF EVOLUTION THE LONG BORDERS WHICH TO ME ARE THE SPIRITUAL CENTRE OF BERRYFIELDS 
HAVE EVOLVED OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS 
THEY HAD A REVAMP A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THE PLANTS WERE TAKEN OUT AND IT WAS DOUBLE DUG THEN PUT BACK 
THE THEME HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF COLOUR SWELLING UP FROM A COOL START DOWN AT THE FAR END 
GETTING HOTTER AND WARMER AND MORE COMPLEX 
AND COMING TO A FIERY CULMINATION DOWN AT WHAT WE ALWAYS CALL THE HOT END OF THE LONG BORDERS 
BUT IT'S ALSO GOT TO LOOK GOOD COMING BACK THE OTHER WAY 
AND NOT TO BE TOO BLOCKY NOT TO BE TOO OBVIOUSLY DESIGNED 
IT SHOULD FEEL NATURAL AND THAT'S PART OF THE EVOLUTION OF A BORDER 
BUT IT IS A PROCESS OF CONSTANT CHANGE IT'S NOT A SINGLE PERFORMANCE 
IT CHANGES FROM WEEK TO WEEK AND ALSO AS PLANTS GROW THEY GET BETTER OR EVEN WORSE 
AND YOU NEED TO DIVIDE AND CHANGE THEM 
THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE WE'RE WAITING FOR ARE THE TULIPS 
IT'S BEEN HELD BACK BY THE WEATHER BUT AS SOON AS WE GET SUNSHINE THEY WILL BURST INTO COLOURS 
REALLY GOOD HOT COLOURS TOO 
THE ONE COLOUR THEY WON'T GIVE US AT ALL IS BLUE THERE ARE NO BLUE TULIPS 
IN FACT BLUE IS THE RAREST COLOUR IN THE WHOLE PLANT WORLD 
AND CERTAINLY WE'RE LACKING BLUE HERE IN THE LONG BORDERS 
I WANT TO ADD SOME THROUGHOUT THE YEAR I'LL START TODAY 
I CAN'T THINK OF ANY PLANT THAT YOU CAN GROW IN AN ENGLISH GARDEN 
THAT MORE SUCCESSFULLY ADDS BLUE THAN DELPHINIUM 
THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF DELPHINIUM BLUE AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT BLUES YOU CAN GET 
BUT ALL OF THEM HAVE THAT AMAZING SPIRE OF BLUE 
IN JUNE WHICH IS THEIR MONTH 
IT IS AS VARIED AS ALMOST PURPLE TO ALMOST WHITE REALLY 
DELPHINIUMS ONE WAY OR OTHER DO SEEM TO BE EPITOMISE BLUE 
I'LL PUT ONE GROUP AT THE BACK HERE COS THIS VARIETY MICHAEL AYRES WILL GROW ABOUT SIX FOOT 
I'VE NEVER SEEN THE POINT IN HAVING DWARF DELPHINIUMS 
YES YOU NEED TO STAKE THEM IF THEY'RE TALL BUT THAT'S THE POINT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO 
WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE THAT AND LET THEM BE A GREAT BLUE TOWER AS TALL AS THEY CAN GROW 
I'VE CHOSEN THIS VARIETY MICHAEL AYRES 
COS I WANT THAT PARTICULAR VIOLETY BLUE WITH A TOUCH OF THE BLACK BEE 
BUT IF YOU KNOW YOU'D LIKE A DELPHINIUM OR ANY PLANT 
BUT YOU'RE NOT CERTAIN WHAT YOU WANT OR WHAT'S AVAILABLE THEN THE ANSWER IS TO GO AND SEE IT AT ITS BEST 
WITH DELPHINIUMS THAT'S JUNE 
SO LAST JUNE WE WENT TO GODINTON HOUSE IN KENT 
WHERE THEY HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF DELPHINIUM 
ALL OF THEM LOVINGLY TENDED BY THE LOCAL DELPHINIUM SOCIETY 
DELPHINIUMS BECOME A WAY OF YOUR LIFE 
THEY ARE JUST LOVELY I LOVE THEM 
OH THEY ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL 
THEY'RE JUST SO STUNNING YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY WOW 
DELPHINIUMS GIVE YOU A HUGE RANGE OF COLOURS 
WE GET CRANBERRY COLOURS PINKS WHITES VERY NICE CREAMS PURPLES LIGHT BLUES CAMBRIDGE BLUES 
BUT NO REDS AND THERE ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE IN THE FUTURE 
HERE IS A VERY NICE MID BLUE CALLED MOLLY BUCHANAN WITH A DARK BEE 
THIS HAS THE RIGHT SHAPE 
IT'S NOT BIG AND AWKWARD IT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE 
AND IT'S A LOVELY GARDEN DELPHINIUM SO I'D RATE IT HIGHLY 
MANY PEOPLE WOULD DISAGREE WITH ME I CAN ASSURE YOU 
THERE ARE A MULTITUDE OF OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT IS THE BEST THE NICEST COLOUR ETC 
MOST PEOPLE GO FOR THE DEEP BLUE AND I'M A CULPRIT OF THAT AS WELL 
THIS PARTICULAR PLANT HERE THIS ZINGY BLUE OF A COLOUR 
IT'S FRILLY COMPARED TO SOME OF THEM WITH JUST A HINT OF WHITE THERE 
BUT IT IS A ZINGY BLUE I THINK YOU'D AGREE 
THIS ONE HERE TIDDLES UM IS SO PRETTY 
I LIKE IT BECAUSE OF THE COMPACTNESS OF THE FLOWERS 
AS YOU CAN SEE THE FRIGHT'S GOT THREE LAYERS 
AND THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE WHICH IS CALLED THE BEE 
YOU CAN'T SEE IT MUCH BECAUSE THAT'S THE SAME COLOUR AS THE FLOWER 
WHICH I THINK IS QUITE ATTRACTIVE 
I LOVE THIS ONE 
WE LOOK AFTER THE ROYAL GARDEN OF GODINTON HOUSE 
AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS AND THE WALLED GARDEN IS DEVELOPING ALL THE TIME 
SO EVERY YEAR THE DISPLAY GETS BETTER 
THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST YEARS WE'VE HAD 
PEOPLE SAY THEY'RE TOO BIG BUT THERE ARE WAYS YOU CAN MAKE DELPHINIUMS SMALLER 
WHEN THE SHOOTS COME OUT OF THE GROUND THERE ARE MASSES OF SHOOTS 
MANY DELPHINIUM GROWERS THIN THEM OUT TO MAKE THEM GROW TALL 
BUT IF YOU'VE NOT THINNED THEM THEY'LL GROW MUCH SHORTER AND YOU'LL HAVE MORE FLOWERS 
THE OTHER THING IS THE MORE YOU WATER THEM THE TALLER THEY WILL GROW 
THE MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION IS I CAN'T GROW DELPHINIUMS BECAUSE I HAVE SLUGS 
THEY DO EAT SOME OF THEM BUT A SLUG IS A PERSON YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE WITH AND YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT HIM 
THE TALLER VARIETY'S OBVIOUSLY AFFECTED BY THE WEATHER 
THEY JUST FALL OVER AND THERE'S NO WAY OF STANDING THEM BACK UP AGAIN 
THEY JUST SNAP AND EVERYTHING IS LOST REALLY 
WE ALL GET FRUSTRATIONS OVER THEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
BUT YOU GO BACK FOR MORE 
SOME YEARS YOU THINK WHY AM I BOTHERING WITH THIS 
BUT YOU GO AGAIN AND AGAIN COS YOU HAVE THIS THING ABOUT DELPHINIUMS 
I'M SADDENED TO SEE THAT THEY'RE SO UNDERREPRESENTED IN GARDENS AROUND THE COUNTRY 
A DELPHINIUM LIKES THE BEST SOIL AND THE BEST MULCH YOU CAN GET 
KEEP AWAY FROM A TREE GET LOTS OF SUNSHINE WATER THEM WELL 
DO WHAT YOU CAN AND THEY WILL REWARD YOU VERY RICHLY 
THE SLAG YOU JUST HAVE TO FIGHT AND YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE YOUR OWN WAY THAT YOU WISH TO DO THIS 
I WON'T TELL YOU WHAT I DO IT'S NOT NICE 
THAT IS ALL FIVE OF THESE MICHAEL AYRES DELPHINIUMS IN THE GROUND 
WHICH SHOULD INJECT EXTRA BLUE INTO THE BORDER 
IT'S TRUE THAT DELPHINIUMS SEEM TO BE THE FAVOURITE FOOD OF SLUGS AND SNAILS 
I'M GOING TO GET SOMETHING TO PUT ROUND EACH ONE 
TO TRY AND KEEP THEM AWAY FROM THEM UNTIL THEY GROW UP AND THEN THEY'LL BE FINE 
EACH WEEK WE WILL BE LOOKING AT A PEST OR A DISEASE AND FOCUSING IN ON IT 
SLUGS AND SNAILS HAVE TO BE THE FIRST BECAUSE THEY'RE TOP OF EVERYBODY'S PROBLEM 
A RECENT R. H. S. SURVEY FOUND THAT EACH WEEK I GET PEOPLE ASKING HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH SLUGS AND SNAILS 
WHILST I WAS AWAY LAST YEAR FILMING AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY GARDENS 
I KNOW THAT ALYS WAS TRYING ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT ORGANIC METHODS OF KEEPING THEM AWAY 
FROM OUR PRECIOUS PLANTS 
ARE YOU HUNTING FOR SLUGS YEAH LOADS ALREADY 
THIS IS WHY WHEREVER POSSIBLE I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT GROWING AS MANY VEGETABLES UNDER COVER 
OR IN SOME KIND OF PROTECTED AREA IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST WAY OF KEEPING SLUGS AND SNAILS AWAY 
YEAH THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU CAN COME OUT AND FIND WHOLE ROWS DECIMATED 
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT FEELING OF WAR 
WHOLE ROWS GONE YEAH 
I FEEL QUITE ANGRY ABOUT IT BUT THE COFFEE IS WORKING 
COFFEE DEFINITELY WORKS 
IT'S USED COFFEE GROUNDS THAT WE GET FROM A COFFEE SHOP 
AS LONG AS IT'S IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THICK IT JUST NEEDS TO BE QUITE WIDE 
MM HMM SO THEY GET ON IT AND THEN REALLY WANT TO GET OFF IT AGAIN BASICALLY 
AND BEER TRAPS WORK REALLY WELL 
WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS THAT COFFEE BEER TRAPS AND COPPER TO A DEGREE 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SEVERAL PRONGED ATTACK BUT I UNDERSTAND THE FEELING BETTER ABOUT SLUGS 
I MEAN THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I CAME OUT LAST YEAR AND EVERY SWEET PEA WAS COMPLETELY 
IT FELT REALLY PERSONAL WELL I AM NOW GOING TO USE SLUG PELLETS 
BUT BEFORE ANYBODY GETS TOO EXCITED AND RUSHES TO PENCIL AND PAPER 
THESE ARE SLUG PELLETS WHICH ARE CERTIFIED FOR ORGANIC USE 
AND WE'RE GOING TO USE THEM ROUND THE DELPHINIUMS 
BUT WHAT I'D SAY IS ONLY USE THEM IF YOU WOULD OTHERWISE BE USING NON ORGANIC SLUG PELLETS 
WHICH ARE VERY HARMFUL AND NOT A GOOD IDEA AT ALL 
SO RATHER THAN REACH FOR THEM PERHAPS YOU SHOULD GIVE THESE A GO 
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO AND I'LL REPORT BACK HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE 
NOW IT'S TIME TO JOIN JOE ON HIS NEW BIG ADVENTURE 
TAKE AN ALLOTMENT GROW SOME VEG WHERE NO DOUBT HE'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH SLUGS AND SNAILS 
BUT OF COURSE FIRST OF ALL HE HAS TO FIND HIS PLOT 
AH MORNING GOOD MORNING THANKS IT'S PACKED FULL ISN'T IT 
HEAVY THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHEERS 
THIS IS AN ORGANIC VEGY BOX 
WE GET IT EVERY WEEK BUT LOOK AT THIS STUFF 
I'VE BEEN A PROFESSIONAL GARDENER FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
AND REALLY I SHOULD BE GROWING IT MYSELF 
MONTY AND CAROL'S ENTHUSIASM FOR GROWING YOUR OWN IS INFECTIOUS 
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE DOING IT AND I'VE HAD A DABBLE IN THE CONTAINER VEG GARDEN AT BERRYFIELDS 
THIS IS MY FAMILY BY THE WAY HELLO 
BUT REALLY THE GARDEN IS A LITTLE BIT TOO SMALL 
AND ALSO IT'S A FAMILY GARDEN 
I DON'T WANT TO RIP UP THE PLANTING TO GET FRUIT AND VEG INTO HERE 
I CAN HAVE A FEW CONTAINERS BUT WE'VE GOT A FEW MOUTHS TO FILL 
IF I WAS GOING TO REPLACE THAT BOX I'D NEED TO HAVE QUITE A BIG SPACE SO THIS YEAR I'VE GOT AN ALLOTMENT 
I STARTED LOOKING FOR AN ALLOTMENT BEFORE CHRISTMAS BUT EVERYONE SEEMS TO WANT THEM THESE DAYS 
ESPECIALLY IN INNER CITY AREAS WHERE THERE'S A BIG POPULATION 
AND NOT A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF GREEN SPACE TO GO AROUND 
I REALLY WANTED ONE WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE BUT NOT EASY TO FIND 
I CAME AND LOOKED AT THIS SITE BECAUSE THIS SITE IS THE CLOSEST TO MY HOUSE WITH AVAILABLE PLOTS 
ACTUALLY THIS IS THE VERY ONE THAT I COULD'VE HAD 
THE KIDS WOULD'VE LOVED IT BUT IT JUST MAKES ME LAUGH IT'S LIKE AN OLD SHANTY TOWN 
IT'S GOT A BAR IN THE CORNER BARBECUE OVER THERE 
THE PLOT OF LAND HERE AND ANOTHER BIT OF LAND HERE 
THE THING THAT REALLY PUT ME OFF WAS THAT IT'S SO NEAR A REALLY BUSY ROAD 
YOU GET THE NOISE OF THE TRAFFIC ALL THE TIME I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE TO RELAX A BIT OF PEACE AND QUITE 
SO IT WASN'T QUITE RIGHT 
WHILST I WAS ON THE SITE I INVITED JEFF BARBER WHO'S THE ALLOTMENT MENTOR FOR NORTH LONDON 
TO TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE CURRENT SITUATION IN ALLOTMENT ALLOCATION 
IT HAS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO BEEN A STEADY INCREASE 
BIT BY BIT AND THERE HAS BEEN NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES 
IN THE TAKE UPS IN CERTAIN PARTS AND AREAS 
WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR ALLOTMENTS THESE DAYS 
IT'S A DIFFERENT GROUP NOW MUCH YOUNGER A MIDDLE GENERATION HAS GONE 
PEOPLE IN THEIR THIRTIES WITH YOUNG KIDS WHO ARE CONCERNED WITH WHAT THEY ARE EATING AND HOW IT'S PRODUCED 
AND A LOT OF WOMAN ARE GOING FOR IT AREN'T THEY THE MAJORITY OF NEW PLOTHOLDERS IN LONDON ARE WOMEN 
THERE'S ONE SITE IN HARROGATE WITH AN ALL FEMALE COMMITTEE 
BUT IF YOU GAVE ME ONE TIP O. K. AS A NEW ALLOTMENTEER 
WHAT WOULD IT BE 
TAKE IT EASY DO A BIT AT A TIME GO STEP BY STEP 
AND DON'T TRY AND RUSH THINGS BUT DO TRY AND GROW THINGS 
THAT IS THE MAIN AIM I LIKE THAT GOOD BIT OF ADVICE 
WELL I KEPT LOOKING FOR ANOTHER FEW WEEKS 
AND I FINALLY FOUND A SITE THAT HAD SOME SPARE PLOTS ON 
THAT I LIKED AND THIS IS IT 
I REALLY LIKE IT HERE 
IT'S NICE AND OPEN IT'S GOT A REALLY GOOD FELING ABOUT IT 
AND ALSO IT'S NICE AND QUIET 
IT'S SOMEWHERE I REALLY WANT TO COME ON THE WEEKENDS 
BRING THE KIDS UP HERE BRING CATHY UP HERE 
SO IT'S GOT LOTS OF THINGS GOING FOR IT 
THE TRANSPORT'S GOOD TOO 
I CAN CYCLE HERE IN ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES FROM HOME 
I CAN DRIVE HERE IN ABOUT TWENTY FIVE 
OR THERE'S A TRAIN AT THE END OF MY ROAD 
AND LITERALLY IT ENDS UP ABOUT FIVE MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD 
I CAN TAKE MY BIKE ON IT AS WELL SO I CAN GET HERE REALLY QUICKLY 
THAT'S IMPORTANT NOW I'VE BEEN HERE 
GRAFTING AWAY FOR THREE MONTHS NOW 
AND WELL THERE'S BEEN SOME UPS AND DOWNS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT 
I'M GETTING IN TO ALLOTMENT LIFE I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW IT YOU RIGHT NOW 
YOU CAN FOLLOW ME THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ON MY BRAND NEW ALLOTMENT 
OH JOE YOU TEASE I WANTED TO SEE THAT 
ANYWAY WE'VE GOT TO WAIT TILL NEXT WEEK 
WE SHALL BE FOLLOWING HIS PROGRESS WHEN HE REVEALS IT WEEK BY WEEK 
AND STILL TO COME ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
I SHALL BE SOWING SOME ANNUALS TO PROVIDE MORE COLOUR FOR THE LONG BORDERS 
ALSO BE SOWING THE COSMOS SEEDS FOR THE TRIAL 
SO IF YOU'RE TAKING PART GET A PENCIL OR EVEN GET YOUR SEEDS READY 
I SHALL BE PLANTING OUT THE NEW POTATOES THAT I CHITTED FIVE WEEKS AGO 
AND ALSO PLANTING A NEW VARIETY OF PEA THAT I'VE NEVER GROWN BEFORE 
BUT FIRST I'M GOING TO PLANT SOME CURRANTS 
IF YOU'VE NOT GROWN CURRANTS BEFORE YOU MIGHT THINK THEY'RE MUCH OF A MUCHNESS 
BUT THERE ARE REALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES I'LL POINT THEM OUT IN A MINUTE 
WHITE CURRANTS AND REDCURRANTS ARE SIMILAR 
BUT BLACKCURRANTS NEED TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY I'LL PUT THIS ASIDE 
WE'LL DO IT LATER I'VE GOT A WHITE VERSAILLES WHITE CURRENT 
AND A LAXTON'S NO ONE REDCURRANT 
NOW MOST PEOPLE KNOW REDCURRANT 
REDCURRANT JELLY YOU USE THEM IN SUMMER PUDDING 
IT'S A REALLY GOOD STANDBY FRUIT 
BUT NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE GROW WHITE CURRANTS 
WHICH YOU CAN THINK OF AS A SORT OF ALBINO VERSION OF A REDCURRANT 
TO BE TREATED IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY 
THIS SOIL HASN'T BEEN PREPARED EXCEPT FOR A GREEN MANURE 
ALTHOUGH I WILL MULCH THEM WELL SO THAT'S FINE 
NOW LET'S TAKE THIS OUT AS THE RAIN GETS HEAVIER 
NOW YOU'LL PLANT THAT QUITE DEEP 
SO WE GET GOOD GROWTH FROM LOW DOWN 
AND JUST PULL THE SOIL ROUND IT 
LUCKILY THE SOIL IS QUITE DRY AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S JUST ME THAT'S GETTING WET 
I'M GOING TO FIRM THAT IN RIGHT 
THAT'S IN THERE NOW 
FOR SPACING BETWEEN CURRANT BUSHES YOU NEED ROOM TO GET ROUND THEM 
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET AT THE GOOSEBERRIES PRUNE THEM PICK THEM 
SO I THINK A GOOD PACE IS WHAT YOU NEED 
IS THAT FOUR FOOT FIVE FOOT I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT I DO KNOW IS IT DOESN'T WANT TO BE ANY CLOSER THAN THREE FOOT 
HAVING PLANTED THESE 
I'LL PRUNE THEM A LITTLE BIT 
BECAUSE WHAT I WANT TO CREATE IS A GOBLET SHAPE FOR TWO REASONS 
ONE IS TO LET LIGHT AND AIR IN TO RIPEN THE FRUIT 
AND THE OTHER REASON IS THAT SAWFLY 
WHICH AFFLICT GOOSEBERRIES WHITE CURRANTS AND REDCURRANTS 
DON'T LIKE BEING EXPOSED THEY DON'T LIKE WIND AND AIR 
SO THE MORE OF THOSE THINGS I CAN LET IN 
THE LESS LIKELY THEY'RE GOING TO BE ATTACKED BY SAWFLY 
ALTHOUGH IT IS SOMETHING TO WATCH OUT FOR 
I CAN DO THAT BY TAKING OUT THIS RIGHT DOWN IN THERE 
TAKE THAT ONE OUT AND THIS ONE 
I'LL PUT THE LABEL ON ANOTHER STEM 
WHAT I'M LEFT WITH ARE BRANCHES 
FUNDAMENTALLY GROWING AWAY FROM EACH OTHER 
WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS TIP IT BACK A LITTLE BIT 
JUST TAKE THAT BACK 
SO WE HAVE 
STRONG OPEN GROWTH 
AND THAT'S A GOOD START 
NOW LET'S GO TO OUR BLACKCURRANT 
WHICH IS BEN SAREK BY THE WAY 
WHICH IS A REALLY GOOD VARIETY IF YOU'RE LIMITED IN SPACE 
IT'S SMALLER THAN MOST OTHER VARIETIES 
AND YET HAS MASES OF FRUIT AND IS VERY RELIABLE 
BLACKCURRANTS DIFFER FROM RED AND WHITE CURRANTS IN THREE MAIN WAYS 
THE FIRST IS THEY RESPOND VERY FAVOURABLY 
TO RICH SOIL AND LOTS OF FEED 
THE SECOND THING IS THEY FRUIT ON NEW WOOD 
WHICH LEADS TO THE THIRD DIFFERENCE THE PRUNING REGIME 
BECAUSE THESE FRUIT ON NEW WOOD 
YOU RENEW IT ALL THE TIME 
AND THAT PRUNING IS LARGELY DONE IN SUMMER AFTER FRUITING 
SO I SHALL PLANT THIS WITH PLENTY OF MUCK BENEATH IT 
HONESTLY YOU CAN'T GIVE IT TOO MUCH 
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IF YOU'VE GOT LIMITED COMPOST OR MANURE 
AND YOU WANT TO MULCH OR FEED YOUR FRUIT 
GIVE THE LION'S SHARE TO THE BLACKCURRANT 
WHATEVER'S LEFT OVER GIVE TO THE REST 
BECAUSE THEY WILL REPAY THAT FEEDING YOU'LL REALLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE 
RIGHT ONE MORE IN THERE 
NOW LET'S GET THIS PLANTED AND AGAIN THERE'S A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE 
BECAUSE BLACKCURRANTS CAN BE PLANTED DEEPER THAN RED OR WHITE CURRANTS 
THE REASON FOR THAT IS VERY SIMPLE BECAUSE ALL THE NEW GROWTH WILL COME FROM THE BASE 
ESSENTIALLY WE COPPICE IT 
SO EVERY TIME YOU PRUNE YOU PRUNE RIGHT DOWN TO THE GROUND 
THE LOWER THE GROWTH COMES FROM THE BETTER 
FIRM THAT IN LIKE THAT 
AND THEN BRING THE SOIL ACROSS 
SO WE'LL PULL THAT ROUND AND FIRM IT IN 
I WILL WATER IT IN ALONG WITH THE OTHERS AND THEN MULCH IT THICKLY 
NOW ANYBODY WHO'S WATCHED GARDENERS' WORLD AT ALL 
WILL KNOW THAT WE GARDEN HERE ORGANICALLY AND ARE PROUD OF THAT 
AND WE TRY TO KEEP THE GARDEN AS SUSTAINABLE AS POSSIBLE 
BUT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO MAKE A FEW COMPROMISES AND CONCESSIONS 
HOWEVER THE GARDEN DESIGNER TOBY BUCKLAND 
MAKES NO COMPROMISES AT ALL 
IN HIS QUEST TO RECYCLE TO RE USE MATERIALS 
AND TO CREATE GARDENS THAT ARE TRULY SUSTAINABLE 
LISTEN HERE 
I'M TOTALLY 
TOGETHER 
WHAT THRILLS ME ABOUT GARDENING IS SEEING THE POTENTIAL IN UNLIKELY THINGS 
THE POTENTIAL IN MATERIALS 
THINGS THAT YOU CAN FIND THINGS THAT YOU CAN GATHER TO GIVE YOUR GARDEN CHARACTER 
ALSO THE POTENTIAL IN USING PLANTS IN AN INNOVATIVE WAY 
THE PLANTS THAT REALLY THILL ME 
AREN'T JUST YOUR GRAND GRASSES 
THEY'RE THE LITTLE THINGS THAT 
EKE OUT THEIR EXISTENCE IN COAST WALLS IN SEA DEFENCES 
IN THE WALLS IN MY GARDEN 
A GREAT EXAMPLE IS RED VALERIAN IT'S REALLY CALLED CENTRANTHUS RUBER 
AND IT'S GOT THIS BEAUTIFUL SORT OF PINK BILLOWING FLOWER 
I JUST LOVE ITS TENACIOUSNESS 
IT CLINGS TO WALLS PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE'S LIME MORTAR 
THAT'S ONE OF THE INSPIRATIONS FOR THE PLANTING STYLE HERE 
YOU MIGHT THINK THAT A GARDEN THAT HAS SUSTAINABLE CREDENTIALS 
IS JUST FULL OF WELL TOILET BOWLS AND SINKS 
PLANTED IN A HUMOROUS WAY I DON'T THINK LIKE THAT 
I THINK IT HAS TO BE MORE SOPHISTICATED MORE THOUGHT THROUGH 
FOR EXAMPLE THE STONE IN THE WALL THAT I'M SITTING ON 
CAME FROM AN OLD SCHOOL OVER THE ROAD WHICH TURNED INTO HOUSES 
NOW I WENT TO THAT SCHOOL AS A BOY IT WAS MY FIRST SCHOOL 
MY FATHER WENT TO THAT SCHOOL HIS FATHER WENT TO THAT SCHOOL AS WELL 
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE WERE ALL TOLD TO COME TO THE FRONT OF OUR CLASS 
AND PUT OUR NOSES AGAINST THESE OLD BOULDERS FOR BEING NAUGHTY 
NOW BECAUSE THEY HAD NO USE FOR THEM IN THE DEVELOPMENT 
I GOT THEM FOR FREE AND I WAS ABLE TO BARROW THEM UP 
STICK THEM TOGETHER AND PUT THEM INTO THIS WALL THAT ACTUALLY HAS A MEANING FOR ME 
THAT'S WHY I LOVE IT 
THIS WILLOW HAS A BIT OF A STORY TO IT 
IT'S ACTUALLY FROM MY NEIGHBOUR'S GARDEN 
HE WAS COMPLAINING TO ME THAT THE SEED HEADS OF THIS GOAT WILLOW 
WERE SPREADING ALL OVER AND WANTED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT 
I SAID I'LL CHOP IT DOWN FOR YOU IF I CAN HAVE ALL THE THIN SHOOTS 
COS I'VE GOT PLENTY OF USES FOR THEM IN MY GARDEN 
BASICALLY WHAT I'M DOING IS EMULATING 
THOSE HIDEOUS PLASTIC WRAP AND WIRE PLANT SUPPORTS 
YOU GET IN THE GARDEN CENTRE THAT STAND OUT FROM YOUR BORDERS 
AND SHOUT OUT FROM THE PLANTS AND DETRACT FROM THEM 
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS MORE NATURAL IS MORE NATURAL AS WELL 
OF COURSE THIS WILLOW IS REALLY WET 
HE ONLY CUT IT THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY BUT AS IT DRIES 
IT STOPS BEING SO BENDY STARTS TO BECOME NICE AND RIGID 
NOW THAT SITS IN YOUR BORDER 
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PLANT SUPPORT MADE FROM YOUR NEIGHBOUR'S PRUNINGS 
IT'S AMAZING THE PLANTS THAT WILL SELF SEED AROUND YOUR GARDEN 
IF YOU GIVE THEM THE SORT OF THEATRE THE STAGE FOR THEM TO DO THEIR THING 
BEHIND THE APPLE TREE THERE 
I'VE GOT A CLASSIC CANARY ISLAND PLANT ECHIUM PININANA 
AND I'VE GOT DIFFERENT SPECIES OF ECHIUMS DOTTED AROUND THE GARDEN 
THAT FINGERS CROSSED WILL COME UP SURVIVE THEIR FIRST WINTER 
AND THEN PUT ON THESE MAGNIFICENT SPIKES OF FLOWERS 
AS SOON AS THEY DO THE SEED WILL DROP AND THEY'LL START SPRINGING UP 
IT'S SUSTAINABLE BECAUSE I DO LESS TO CREATE COLOUR 
AND ALSO GARDENS DROPPING SEED ABOUT 
IS GREAT FOR WILDLIFE THE BIRDS ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT 
IT MEANS I'M NOT SPENDING ANY MONEY DRIVING TO BUY BEDDING PLANTS 
PARTICULARLY IT'S LOOKING AFTER THE GARDEN FOR ME 
I SHOULD IMAGINE TO MANY GARDENERS 
JUST ALLOWING PLANTS TO SEED WILLY NILLY ALL OVER THE PLACE 
SOUNDS LIKE A CRAZY IDEA 
BUT FOR ME IT'S ALREADY WORKING ALREADY STARTING TO SHOW BENEFITS 
THIS NIGELLA FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE ONLY FLOWERS THAT WAS IN THIS GARDEN 
WHEN WE MOVED HERE TWO YEARS AGO IS ALREADY ON THE SPREAD 
IT'S MADE ITS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE BORDER 
LOOKING BEAUTIFUL THERE AMONGST THE GERANIUMS 
AND HERE IT IS ON THE SIDE OF THE STEP 
I COULD NEVER HAVE PLANTED IT THERE 
AND I COULDN'T HAVE FOUND A BETTER SPOT FOR IT MYSELF 
TOBY BUCKLAND WILL BE MAKING A SUSTAINABLE GARDEN 
FOR GARDENERS' WORLD LIVE AND IF YOU WANT TO GO AND SEE IT 
WE'RE ON BETWEEN JUNE ELEVENTH AND FIFTEENTH 
AND OF COURSE I WILL BE THERE WITH THE TEAM TOO 
FOR DETAILS OF HOW TO GET THERE OR HOW MUCH IT COSTS 
AND HOW TO GET YOUR TICKETS GO TO OUR WEBSITE 
NOW I SAID I WAS GOING TO GROW ANNUALS THIS YEAR TO ADD COLOUR TO THE LONG BORDER 
WE'VE DONE IT A LITTLE IN THE PAST BUT I WANT TO DO IT MORE THIS YEAR 
GET SOME REAL DEEP COLOUR 
THERE'LL BE LOTS BUT WE'VE STARTED THE PROCESS HERE 
WITH THIS LEONOTIS LEONURUS AND I SAW THIS 
GROWING AT KIRSTENBOSCH IN SOUTH AFRICA 
WHEN I WAS FILMING AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY GARDENS 
I'VE GROWN THIS FOR MANY YEARS AS AN ANNUAL THAT GROWS HUGELY TALL 
LIKE A SUNFLOWER WITH THIS BRILLIANT ORANGE COLOUR 
I'M ALSO GOING TO GROW ANOTHER ORANGE FLOWER 
WHICH IS TITHONIA ROTUNDIFOLIA TORCH 
TORCH IS THE BEST VARIETY TO GROW 
AND THIS HAS GOT A FAIRLY LARGE SEED 
IF YOU LOOK YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE ALMOST LIKE CLOVES 
NOW IF YOU HAVE SEED THAT BIG 
TAKE THE TROUBLE TO HANDLE THEM INDIVIDUALLY GROW THEM IN PLUGS 
THE ROOTS WILL NEED LESS DISTURBANCE 
AND IT'LL SAVE TIME AND TROUBLE LATER ON 
AND BOTH LEONOTIS AND TITHONIA ARE TENDER ANNUALS 
SO YOU SOW THEM NOW GROW THEM ON PROTECTED BY HEAT 
AND THEY'LL NEED SOME HEAT TO GERMINATE A WINDOWSILL WILL DO WITH A RADIATOR UNDERNEATH 
AND PLANT THEM OUT AFTER THE LAST FROST 
AFTER CHELSEA IS A GOOD RULE OF THUMB 
I'M ALSO GOING TO SOW SOME ANTIRRHINUM SOME SNAPDRAGONS 
WHICH ARE A HALF HARDY ANNUAL 
YOU CAN SEE THAT THESE SEEDS ARE VERY DIFFERENT INDEED 
I NEED MY GLASSES FOR THESE COS THEY'RE TINY 
THEY ARE LIKE POPPY SEEDS 
ABSOLUTELY MINUTE 
SO WHEN YOU SOW THEM JUST A PINCH 
I'VE GOT A SEED TRAY WITH BERRYFIELDS COMPOST IN THERE 
AND I'LL JUST TAKE A TINY PINCH AND SCATTER THEM OVER 
THE PROBLEM IS OF COURSE YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
WITH THE BEST GLASSES IN THE WORLD YOU CAN'T SEE TINY BLACK SEEDS AGAINST BLACK COMPOST 
SO DON'T TRY AND SOW TOO MANY 
JUST A LITTLE PINCH LIKE THAT 
NOW ANTIRRHINUMS NEED SOME LIGHT TO GERMINATE 
BUT THEY ALSO NEED A BIT OF PROTECTION 
SO I'M USING VERMICULITE 
JUST LIGHTLY SPRINKLING IT OVER 
WHICH WILL PROTECT THE SEEDS TO A DEGREE FROM DISTURBANCE 
BUT LET THE LIGHT THROUGH 
AND THEN RATHER THAN WATER THEM DIRECTLY ON TOP 
WHICH WITH A SMALL SEED CAN SPREAD THEM TO THE SIDE OF THE SEED TRAY 
I'M GOING TO PUT THEM IN A DISH OF WATER 
SO IT ABSORBS IT 
AND OF COURSE THE OTHER THING IS NOT TO FORGET TO LABEL IT 
AND OF COURSE THAT TECHNIQUE OF SOWING SEED 
APPLIES TO ALL VERY SMALL SEED LIKE TOBACCO PLANTS OR PETUNIAS 
ANYTHING YOU CAN'T HANDLE INDIVIDUALLY 
THE NEXT SEED I'M GOING TO SOW YOU CAN HANDLE INDIVIDUALLY 
IT'S THE COSMOS THAT SO MANY OF YOU HAVE GOT TO TAKE PART IN OUR COSMOS TRIAL 
WE GAVE AWAY FIVE THOUSAND PACKETS ONE THOUSAND OF FIVE DIFFERENT VARIETIES 
AND THE POINT OF THE TRIAL IS TO SEE WHICH CAN LAST LONGEST 
SEE WHICH CAN GO ON FLOWERING RIGHT INTO NOVEMBER AND BEYOND IF POSSIBLE 
NOW WE ALL KNOW IF YOU GROW COSMOS THAT THE WAY TO KEEP THEM LASTING 
IS TO DEAD HEAD THEM JUST KEEP PINCHING OFF THE FLOWERS AS THEY FADE AND THEY FORM NEW FLOWERS 
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO 
GROW THESE DEAD HEAD THEM AS THEY FADE AND THEN LET US KNOW WHICH ONE WENT ON FLOWERING LONGEST 
I SHALL START SOWING THEM NOW READY TO PLANT OUT IN THE END OF MAY BEGINNING OF JUNE 
ALONG WITH THE TITHONIA AND THE LEONOTIS 
I'M GOING TO START WITH PURITY WHICH IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE COSMOS 
SIMPLE PURE WHITE AND JUST LOVELY 
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THE COSMOS SEED UNLIKE THE ANTIRRHINUM 
IS PRETTY LARGE 
I'LL JUST PUT MY GLASSES ON BECAUSE 
LOOK THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE BITS OF ROSEMARY LEAF REALLY 
LIKE THAT SO THEY CAN BE HANDLED INDIVIDUALLY 
I'M GONNA PUT THAT BACK FOR A MOMENT AND I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND 
SOWING THESE EITHER IN SMALL UNITS LIKE THAT OR IN PLUGS INDIVIDUALLY 
BECAUSE THAT WILL RESTRICT THE AMOUNT OF HANDLING AND THEREFORE ROOT DISTURBANCE 
BECAUSE THEY WILL PROBABLY NEED PRICKING UP AND POTTING ON INTO A BIGGER CONTAINER 
SO ALONG HERE I'LL SIMPLY TAKE EACH ONE 
AND PLACE IT 
SO WE'VE GOT A GOOD GAP BETWEEN THEM 
THE BEAUTY OF THESE FIVE DIFFERENT COMPARTMENTS IS I CAN HAVE EACH OF THE FIVE DIFFERENT COSMOS VARIETIES 
GROWING SIDE BY SIDE 
SO IN A WAY THE TRIAL BEGINS FROM SEED SOWING 
JUST FOR THE MOMENT I'LL ONLY DO ONE ROW 
ALL THOUGH I WILL FINISH IT OFF LATER 
BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE ON THE SURFACE LIKE THAT 
JUST TAKE SOME MORE COMPOST 
AND SPRINKLE IT OVER THE TOP SO THEY'RE COVERED 
AND THEN GO ONTO THE NEXT ONE 
I KNOW I'VE ALREADY SAID THAT THE SPRING GARDEN LOOKS FANTASTIC 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE BULBS AND HELLEBORES THAT ARE LOOKING GREAT IT'S THE WOODY PLANTS TOO 
THE CHERRY IS COMING INTO BLOSSOM 
AND ALL THE DIFFERENT CHERRIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
AND THIS EXOCHORDA WHICH IS ONE OF THE FIRST PLANTS 
PLANTED HERE IN THE SPRING GARDEN BY RACHEL 
IS NOW REALLY COMING INTO IT'S OWN 
A FANTASTIC ARRAY OF WHITE BLOSSOM 
AND AS THESE EARLY SPRING FLOWERS FADE 
THE BATON WILL BE TAKEN ON BY SHRUBS LIKE THE LILAC BEHIND ME 
WHICH IS PACKED WITH BUD WHICH WILL COME INTO ITS OWN TOWARDS THE END OF SPRING 
NOW LILAC IS ONE OF THOSE PLANTS THAT IS VERY OLD FASHIONED 
IT'S NEVER BECOME FASHIONABLE AND TRENDY 
YET I GUESS MOST PEOPLE FEEL AFFECTIONATE TOWARDS IT 
ALTHOUGH IT DOES HAVE THE PROBLEM OF GROWING RATHER LARGE 
BUT DON'T BE PUT OFF IT'S CERTAINLY WORTH PLANTING 
AND THERE ARE LOTS TO CHOOSE FROM 
AND LIKE THE DELPHINIUM IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE FULL RANGE 
GO OUT THIS SPRING SEE AS MANY LILACS AS YOU CAN 
WELL WE DID THAT WE WENT OUT TO SEE LILACS AT THEIR VERY BEST 
AND WE ONLY HAD TO GO TO ONE GARDEN 
THAT WAS COLIN CHAPMAN'S GARDEN AT NORMAN'S FARM IN SUFFOLK 
WHERE HE HAS BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
OVER FIVE HUNDRED DIFFERENT CULTIVARS OF LILAC 
WHY LILACS LIKE THE ROSE THEY'RE PART OF OUR CULTURAL BEING 
YOU SEE THEY'VE GOT A LITERATURE OF THEIR OWN 
THEY'VE GOT A POETRY OF THEIR OWN 
THEY'VE GOT AN ARTFORM OF THEIR OWN 
THEY REMIND US OF OUR PARENTS THEY TAKE US BACK TO OUR GRANDPARENTS 
WHEN WE CAME HERE TWENTY THREE YEARS AGO 
WE FOUND THAT WE HAD A STREAM 
RUNNING THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE GARDEN 
SO I DECIDED TO CONSTRUCT A LILAC WALK 
DENSE AND FULL OF FOLIAGE IN THE SUMMER WHEN I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE STREAM 
BUT WHICH WAS AN OPEN TRACERY OF BRANCHES IN THE WINTER WHEN THE STREAM WAS LOOKING MAGNIFICENT 
AND SO FOUND I NEEDED ABOUT FORTY LILACS AND I'VE GOT THE KIND OF MIND THAT MUST HAVE FORTY DIFFERENT ONES 
NOT FORTY ALL THE SAME 
AND IT WAS THEN THAT I STARTED LOOKING AND FOUND THAT THERE WERE NOT FORTY LILACS AVAILABLE 
AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO 
SEARCH ELSEWHERE TO FULFIL THE LITTLE QUEST 
SO I JOINED THE INTERNATIONAL LILAC SOCIETY TO FIND OUT 
AND SO NOW TWENTY THREE YEARS LATER WE NOW HAVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED 
DIFFERENT CULTIVARS OF LILAC IN THIS COLLECTION 
AND THEY RANGE WORLDWIDE 
IF YOU MOVE AWAY FROM THE COMMON GARDEN LILAC 
I WOULD SAY THE ONES TO LOOK OUT FOR ARE THE INCREDIBLE LILAC CALLED MASSENA 
WHICH HAS FLOWERHEADS THAT ARE SO BIG 
THAT THEY LOOK LIKE CHEERLEADERS POM POMS 
IT'S A MAGNIFICENT WONDERFUL THING 
THERE'S ANOTHER LOVELY OLD ONE CALLED PAUL THIRION 
WHICH HAS BRILLIANT RED BUDS 
AND THOSE RED BUDS OPEN TO GIVE PALE LILAC DOUBLE FLORETS 
SO THAT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TWO COLOURS IS ABSOLUTELY EXQUISITE 
AND IT FLOWERS MUCH MUCH LATER THAN MOST OTHER LILACS 
SO IF YOU HAVE TWO LILACS SIDE BY SIDE LIKE MASSENA AND PAUL THIRION 
YOU GET THE EQUIVALENT OF SIX WEEKS' FLOWERING OUT OF THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER 
YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT I CHITTED SOME POTATOES ABOUT FIVE WEEKS AGO 
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO PUT THEM IN THE GROUND 
IN FACT GOOD FRIDAY WAS TRADITIONALLY THE TIME WHEN YOU PUT IN YOUR FIRST POTATOES 
BUT THIS YEAR IT WAS EXCEPTIONALLY EARLY AND EXCEPTIONALLY COLD 
AND I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT WORTH PUTTING ANYTHING INTO THE GROUND IF IT FEELS COLD BUT THIS IS FINE 
AND I TELL YOU WHAT JUST TO GET MY HANDS INTO THE SOIL OF THE VEGETABLE GARDEN 
MAKES ME FEEL THAT I'M EXACTLY WHERE I WANT TO BE 
NOW I'VE DUG A LITTLE TRENCH AND PUT SOME LEAF MOULD IN THE BOTTOM 
LEAF MOULD IS PRIMARILY TO RESIST SCAB IT DOES SEEM TO HELP 
BUT COMPOST WORKS WELL AND IT GIVES THEM A NICE SURFACE FOR THE ROOTS TO GO OUT INTO TO START WITH 
THIS IS A VARIETY CALLED EPICURE 
I DON'T REDUCE IT TO ONE TWO OR THREE IS FINE 
THIS GROUND HAS BEEN VERY WELL DUG 
POTATOES RESPOND DIRECTLY TO GOOD RICH SOIL 
NOW THE SPACING AGAIN IT IS NOT A SCIENCE 
THE CLOSER TOGETHER THEY ARE THE SMALLER THE POTATOES WILL BE AND EVENTUALLY THE FEWER YOU'LL GET 
I'D SAY ABOUT A FOOT IS PERFECT HERE 
CERTAINLY NOT CLOSER THAN NINE INCHES 
AND THE TRENCH IS ABOUT NINE INCHES DEEP 
WHAT THAT IS DOING IS IT'S PROTECTING THE TUBER FROM ANY FROST 
NOW POTATOES NEED COVERING UP BECAUSE THEY ARE TENDER 
AND ALSO TO PROTECT THEM FROM ANY AIR BORNE SPORES 
PARTICULARLY POTATO BLIGHT WHICH IS A REAL PROBLEM 
SO A GOOD THICK LAYER A RIDGE ABOVE THEM IS THE IDEA 
AND THEN THEY MAY NEED EARTHING UP LATER ON 
IF THEY GROW FAST AND THERE'S A RISK OF FROST 
WE'LL HAVE TO ADD MORE SOIL OVER THEM TO PROTECT THE FOLIAGE AS WELL AS THE TUBERS 
RIGHT I WILL DO THE SAME ON THE OTHER SIDE 
NOW GROWING YOUR OWN POTATOES IS WONDERFUL 
PARTICULARLY NEW POTATOES WHICH TASTE FANTASTIC FROM THE GROUND 
BUT THEY DO TAKE UP SPACE AND IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT SPACE YOU CAN'T DO IT 
HOWEVER THERE ARE A LOT OF VEGETABLES THAT CAN BE GROWN IN A CONTAINER 
I'M GOING TO GROW SOME PEAS IN THESE TWO OLD WASH TUBS 
THAT SHOULD PERFORM VERY WELL 
NOW THEY'RE QUITE BIG BUT THEY NEED TO BE FOR PEAS 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE LONG ROOTS AND THEY'RE VERY GREEDY AND VERY THIRSTY 
SO YOU NEED TO HAVE PLENTY OF SOIL THERE FOR THEM HOWEVER 
IF YOU'RE GROWING ANY KIND OF VEGETABLE IN A CONTAINER 
CHOOSE THE VARIETY CAREFULLY 
GO FOR A DWARF VARIETY ONE THAT ISN'T GOING TO NEED TOO MUCH ROOM 
AND THAT'LL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO THE SUCCESS 
I'VE GOT TWO DWARF PEAS HERE 
BOTH OF THEM HEIRLOOMS 
ONE FROM BRITAIN WHICH IS VERY WELL KNOWN 
IT'S CALLED LITTLE MARVEL TRIED AND TESTED 
THE OTHER IS AN AMERICAN HEIRLOOM WHICH HAS ONLY JUST BECOME AVAILABLE IN THIS COUNTRY CALLED HALF PINT 
NOW AN HEIRLOOM VARIETY SIMPLY MEANS IT'S OLD AND IT'S BEEN HANDED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION 
AN AWFUL LOT OF THESE GOT LOST BY THE WAY 
BUT THEY ARE BEGINNING TO COME BACK AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO PRESERVE THESE OLD VARIETIES 
THAT ARE FULL OF STORIES AND HISTORY 
A LOT OF THEM VERY LOCAL AND VERY PERSONAL 
AND A LOT OF THEM VERY GOOD TOO AND WORTH GROWING UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES 
SO WE'LL MAKE A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE AMERICAN HEIRLOOM AND THE BRITISH HEIRLOOM 
BETWEEN THE TRIED AND TESTED AND THE BRAND NEW 
SOWING PEAS COULDN'T BE EASIER 
I JUST PLACE THEM ON THE SURFACE AND THEN PUSH THEM UNDERNEATH THE SOIL 
ABOUT HALF AN INCH TO AN INCH DEEP 
WE SHOULD BE PICKING THOSE ROUND ABOUT THE END OF JUNE 
YOU CAN SOW PEAS AT ANY TIME IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS 
BUT IF YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO DO ONE THING THIS WEEKEND 
I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU PUT OUT YOUR ONION SETS 
THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S GETTING ON THEY NEED TO BE GOT IN THE GROUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
BUT ALSO BECAUSE ONIONS ARE GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE THIS YEAR 
APPARENTLY LAST YEAR WAS THE WORST ONION HARVEST EVER 
OVER FORTY THOUSAND TONNES WERE REJECTED AND GROWING YOUR OWN IS GOING TO BE THE CHEAP OPTION 
ONIONS GROW BEST IN WELL DRAINED SOIL IN A SUNNY SITE 
THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY JUST BABY BULBS 
BUT UNLIKE MOST BULBS THEY SHOULDN'T BE PLANTED DEEPLY 
I MAKE A HOLE WITH FINGER AND THEN PUSH THE BULB IN 
MAKING SURE THAT SOME OF IT IS CLEAR OF THE GROUND 
I'M PLANTING THEM IN A GRID NINE INCHES APART 
BUT THEY CAN BE PLANTED JUST AS WELL IN ROWS 
THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO KEEP THEM SPACED EVENLY 
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE EASY TO HOE BECAUSE THEY MUST BE KEPT WEED FREE 
RIGHT THOSE ARE IN THE GROUND 
THE ONLY THING TO WATCH WITH ONION SETS 
OR SHALLOT SETS FOR THAT MATTER 
IS THAT THE BIRDS SOMETIMES PULL THEM UP BEFORE THEY DEVELOP ROOTS 
THAT WILL ANCHOR THEM INTO THE GROUND IF THAT'S THE CASE JUST POP THEM BACK IN AGAIN 
NOW YOU CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT GARDENERS' WORLD IS LOOKING A BIT DIFFERENT 
TO GO WITH OUR NEW ONE HOUR TIME LENGTH 
AND WE THOUGHT WE'D GIVE YOU AN INSIGHT INTO HOW WE WENT ABOUT 
RECORDING THE REFRESHED THEME TUNE AND THE NEW TITLES 
THE JOURNEY BEGAN IN FEBRUARY WHEN THE TEAM WENT DOWN TO ANGEL STUDIOS 
TO WATCH THE RECORDING OF THE NEW THEME TUNE BY THE B. B. C. CONCERT ORCHESTRA 
THIS YEAR IS A VERY EXCITING YEAR FOR GARDENERS' WORLD 
BECAUSE WE'RE MOVING TO FILM ON NEW H. D. CAMERAS 
ER WE'RE MOVING TO ONE HOUR SHOWS FAR MORE THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS 
AND AS SUCH WE KNEW WE HAD TO RE RECORD OUR OPENING TITLES ON A NEW FORMAT 
AND IT SEEMED THE PERFECT TIME TO REARRANGE THE THEME TUNE 
UM WITH THE B. B. C. CONCERT ORCHESTRA 
WE KNEW THEY'D WORKED WITH OTHER B. B. C. THEME TUNES 
AND AT THE TIME THEY WERE DOING A PROJECT WITH WILL GREGORY 
THEY APPROACHED WILL AND ASKED IF HE'D RE ARRANGE THE GARDENERS' WORLD THEME AND HE SAID YES 
THEY'RE ONE OF THE FIVE ORCHESTRAS THE B. B. C. HAS 
THE B. B. C. CONCERT ORCHESTRA ARE USED TO PLAYING SOUNDTRACKS FOR T. V. 
IN RECENT YEARS WE WERE ON BLUE PLANET PLANET EARTH COAST WHICH HAS BEEN ON T. V. RECENTLY 
THAT'S US PLAYING 
THE ORCHESTRA LOVED DOING IT IT'S NEW MUSIC THINGS THEY HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE 
AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT FRIENDS AND FAMILY CAN HEAR THE MUSIC ON THE T. V. WHEN IT COMES OUT ON THE B. B. C. 
SO WITH THE THEME TUNE EXPERTLY RECORDED 
I SPENT THE DAY AT BERRYFIELDS WITH A SPECIALIST FILM COMPANY 
RECORDING THE NEW HIGH DEFINITION TITLES' 
NOW WE WILL BE SPENDING TWO DAYS TO DO FOUR SEQUENCES 
ONE FOR EACH SEASON 
AND THAT'S AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO MAKE AN ENTIRE GARDENERS' WORLD PROGRAMME JUST THOSE TITLES 
THAT'S IT WE'VE COME TO THE END OF OUR NEW LOOK GARDENERS' WORLD 
I HOPE YOU LIKED IT BUT I'D BE INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT YOU THOUGHT 
SO YOU CAN CONTACT US BY GOING TO OUR WEBSITE WHICH IS 
AND GO TO THE MESSAGE BOARD AND LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK 
AND ANYWAY WE'LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK FOR ANOTHER ONE HOUR PROGRAMME 
WHERE WE'LL FOCUS ON JOE'S NEW VENTURE ON HIS ALLOTMENT 
AND CAROL'S ADVENTURE DOWN ON HER GARDEN IN DEVON 
SO WE'LL SEE YOU THEN BYE BYE
