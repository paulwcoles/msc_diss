I'VE GOT TO TEST RAIN CLOTHING 
A WINTER HOLIDAY I LIKE IT NICE AND HOT 
THESE SANDALS CAN'T BE RIGHT FOR THIS SORT OF WEATHER 
MY TOES ARE STICKING OUT OF THEM AND THEY'RE GETTING FREEZING 
THIS IS MORE LIKE IT 
A NICE THICK WARM SOCK 
AND THESE BOOTS HAVE GOT LACES THAT GO RIGHT UP TO THE TOP 
AND RIDGED SOLES TO STOP ME SLIDING ABOUT IN THE SNOW 
OH I'M TOO HOT IN THIS COAT IT'S MADE OF WOOL AND IT'S REALLY THICK 
MUST BE GREAT IN WINTER BUT I'M MELTING HERE 
I'M GOING TO TAKE IT OFF IT CAN'T BE RIGHT FOR HOT WEATHER 
LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE IS IN THIS BOX 
HELLO 
THIS T. SHIRT IS MADE OF COTTON AND IT'S NICE AND THIN 
THESE SHORTS'LL HELP KEEP ME COOL 
IT SAYS ON THE LABEL THIS JUMPER IS MADE OF WOOL 
IT'S CERTAINLY NICE AND WARM WHICH IS WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW 
THESE SHOES DON'T SEEM RIGHT FOR THE RAIN 
THEY'RE NOT KEEPING MY FEET DRY AND IT'S NOT DOING THE SHOES MUCH GOOD 
AH 
THESE ARE A LITTLE MORE LIKE IT 
THEY'LL KEEP MY FEET COVERED RIGHT UP OVER THE ANKLE 
THESE SHORTS ARE NICE AND LIGHT BUT I FANCY SOME TREE CLIMBING 
AND THESE ARE TOO BAGGY THEY'LL CATCH ON THE BRANCHES 
AH 
OH I'LL NEVER GET INTO THESE 
OH LOOK THEY STRETCH 
THESE ARE MADE FROM NYLON AND LYCRA THIN MATERIAL BUT STRONG 
AND STRETCHY ENOUGH TO DO ANYTHING IN I'M GOING TO GET INTO THESE 
OH AH 
WELL THIS JUMPER'S NICE AND WARM BUT THE SNOW'S STICKING TO IT 
AND IT'S MAKING IT WET 
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING BETTER TO KEEP ME WARM AND DRY 
WELL THIS JACKET'S PADDED AND IT'S NICE AND LIGHT 
SO I CAN MOVE MY ARMS ABOUT FREELY 
IT'S MADE FROM POLYESTER WHICH IS A TYPE OF NYLON AND COTTON 
SO IF I FALL IN THE SNOW IT WON'T STICK TO ME 
THIS CAGOULE'S MADE OF WATERPROOF NYLON SO THE RAIN FALLS OFF 
AND THE HOOD KEEPS MY HEAD DRY BETTER GET THAT DRIED OFF 
AH H. H. H. 
OH AH OH OH MY 
THIS PARKING METER IS MADE OUT OF METAL HOW DO YOU KNOW 
IT'S ROCK SOLID 
THIS IS MADE OUT OF METAL TOO 
THIS WASTE BIN LOOKS LIKE METAL BUT IT'S ACTUALLY PLASTIC 
OH IT LOOKS LIKE MARBLE OVER THERE 
I CAN SEE JEWELLERY MADE OUT OF SILVER AND GOLD 
THIS IS MADE OUT OF PLASTIC 
AND THIS IS MADE OUT OF PLASTIC AND IT'S GOT A METAL CORD TOO 
EEH EEH 
HUH AGH 
OH 
FOR TREASURE FROM A WOODEN SHIP 
THERE MIGHT BE A SHIPWRECK HERE 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF ROCKS BUT THIS ROCK DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A ROCK 
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A ROCK WHEN IT'S HIT 
AND IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A ROCK 
SO IT'S TESTED WITH A MAGNET 
THE MATERIAL IS ATTRACTED TO IT SO IT MUST BE IRON OR STEEL 
THEY FIND ANOTHER LUMP OF SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ROCK 
IT FEELS MORE LIKE WOOD 
AND IT ISN'T ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET 
THEY FOUND THE WRECK OF AN OLD SHIP 
AND SOME INTERESTING THINGS 
A GLASS BOTTLE 
A SHIP'S SEXTANT 
A METAL CUP MAYBE SILVER 
AND A HEAVY METAL NECKLACE MAYBE GOLD 
DEE DEE DUM 
ONE TWO 
HEY OH AGH H. H. H. 
WHEREVER THERE ARE RIVERS YOU WILL FIND BRIDGES 
BRIDGES CAN BE BUILT FROM A RANGE OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS 
STONE 
CAST IRON 
BRICK 
THIS ONE IS MADE OUT OF STEEL 
BUT YOU CAN EVEN BUILD A BRIDGE OUT OF PLASTIC 
WHY PLASTIC 
WELL IT'S LIGHT 
THIS MAKES IT EASIER TO BUILD NO LARGE CRANES ARE NEEDED 
THEY CAN SIMPLY BE GLUED TOGETHER 
WHAT A BRIDGE NEEDS IS STRENGTH 
THE PLASTIC THAT'S USED IS REINFORCED WITH GLASS 
BY ITSELF GLASS IS VERY BRITTLE BUT MAKE IT INTO FIBRES 
COAT IT WITH PLASTIC AND A BEAM LIKE THIS IS STRONG AND FLEXIBLE ENOUGH 
TO SUPPORT ITS OWN WEIGHT TWO HUNDRED TIMES OVER 
IT SHOULD PERHAPS BE CALLED A GLASS BRIDGE 
BECAUSE OVER HALF OF IT IS GLASS 
WINTER IN SWEDEN 
COMPETITIONS ARE HELD TO MAKE SCULPTURES OUT OF SNOW 
EVERYONE'S GIVEN A HUGE BLOCK OF SNOW TO CARVE AND SHAPE 
THERE ARE SOME AMAZING RESULTS 
IMAGINE BUILDING SNOWMEN THIS BIG 
BUT EVERY YEAR IN SWEDEN A HOTEL IS BUILT OUT OF SNOW AND ICE 
SNOW IS BLOWN ONTO THE METAL FRAME WHICH IS THEN REMOVED 
INSIDE ICE PILLARS ARE CARVED WHICH PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE ROOF 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
EVERYTHING INSIDE IS MADE OUT OF ICE 
THE BEDS 
THE BAR 
EVEN THE GLASSES ARE MADE OUT OF ICE 
THERE ARE ICE TABLES 
AN ICE CHANDELIER AND THERE'S EVEN A CINEMA 
MY FAVOURITE SUBJECT IS MATHS GEOGRAPHY ENGLISH 
MY FAVOURITE SUBJECT IS 
SCIENCE 
I LIKE LEARNING SCIENCE COS YOU GET TO DO EXPERIMENTS 
SCIENCE DEFINITELY SCIENCE 
I MIGHT BE A SCIENTIST WHEN I GROW UP 
MAD PROFESSORS 
PLANTS AND POLLINATION SEED DISPERSAL 
I MADE A VOLCANO I ENJOYED DISSECTING MICE 
EXPLOSIONS ALL OVER THE PLACE 
HUMAN BODY SKELETON AND THE SKIN 
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE TEETH DID SO MUCH 
E. EQUALS M. C. SQUARED 
WE'VE BEEN DOING GRAVITY 
PUSHING A BALLOON INTO WATER AND FEELING WHAT THE FORCE WAS LIKE 
I'D ASK ISAAC NEWTON DID IT HURT WHEN THE APPLE FELL ON YOUR HEAD 
IT KEEPS YOU DOWN INSTEAD OF FLOATING AROUND IN THE SKY 
I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE BIG BANG THING
