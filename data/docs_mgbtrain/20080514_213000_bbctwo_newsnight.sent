CLIMB OUT OF IT OPPOSITION PARTIES 
POURED SCORN ON THEIR IDEAS THE 
GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND

THE GOVERNMENT FIRST MICHAEL CRICK 
REPORTS 
THERE'S NEWS THAT THE B. B. C. HAS 
PROPOSED A POLITICAL VERSION OF THE 
APPRENTICE WITH SIR ALAN SUGAR

TODAY'S REAL BOARDROOM DRAMA WAS IN 
THE CHAMBER OF THE COMMONS WITH MR. 
BROWN HIMSELF HAVING TO COME UP 
WITH WHEEZES TO AVOID BEING FIRED 
AGAINST RIVALS WHO THINK HE'S 
HOPELESS 
ISN'T THAT WHAT WE'RE HOPELESS SEEING A PRIME MINISTER PUTTING 
SHORT TERM DECISIONS IN FRONT OF 
THE NATIONAL INTEREST 
A LEB 
GOVERNMENT THE WORST PAID ARE 
WORSE OFF WHY DO THEY HAVE TO PAY 
FOR HIS INCOMPETENCE 
THEY'RE THE

FOR THE COMING SESSION AT A TIME 
WHEN FOOD AND FUEL PRICES ARE 
RISING AND MORTGAGES MORE DIFFICULT 
TO OBTAIN S. TO HELP FAMILY 
FINANCES AND IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS 
WE WILL SET OUT THE ELEMENTS OF OUR 
ECONOMIC PLAN AS WE STEER OUR 
ECONOMY SAFELY THROUGH THE CREDIT

FOOD PRICE RISES 
TODAY'S DRAFT 
QUEEN'S SPEECH PROPOSES EIGHTEEN BILLS IN 
ALL RANGING FROM CORONERS TO 
MARINE CONSERVATION AMONG THE 
HIGHLIGHTS A BANKING BILL TO 
PREVENT ANOTHER NORTHERN ROCK AND 
GIVE SAVERS GREATER PROTECTION AN 
IMMIGRATION BILL TO ENSURE NEW

CLAIMING INCAPACITY BENEFIT A 
POLICE BILL FOR ELECTED 
REPRESENTATIVES TO CONTROL THEIR 
LOCAL POLICE HALF THE BILLS WILL 
ONLY BE DRAFTS FOR DISCUSSION 
WHILE THE TORIES CLAIMED WHOLESALE 
THEFT 
THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF THEFT THINGS IN THIS STATEMENT THAT WE 
WELCOME NOT LEAST BECAUSE WE 
PROPOSED THEM WE WELCOME THE 
CONSTITUTION FOR THE N. H. S. THAT'S AN 
IDEA WE SET OUT LAST SUN R. JUNE WE 
WELCOME THE EXTENSION OF THE RIGHT 
TO FLEXIBLE WORKING WE ANNOUNCED 
THAT IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX 
NO FEWER 
THAN TWELVE OF MR. BROWN'S MEASURES HAVE 
BEEN NICKED FROM THEM THEY SAY 
WATCHING THIS PRIME MINISTER TALK 
ABOUT PERSONAL CHOICE TALK ABOUT 
GIVING PEOPLE MORE FREEDOM AND 
LETTING THEM HAVE THE CONTROL OVER 
THEIR LIVES IS COMPLETELY 
UNCONVINCING THE SUPREME LEADER 
JUST DOESN'T DO FREEDOM WON'T 
PEOPLE RIGHTLY CONCLUDE THAT IF YOU 
WNT A GOVERNMENT THAT GIVES YOU 
MORE FREEDOM CHOICE AND 
COMPETITION YOU MIGHT AS WELL VOTE 
FOR THE REAL THING 
BUT NEW LAWS 
DON'T ALWAYS ACHIEVE MUCH SAID NICK 
CLEGG 
MR. SPEAKER SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THIS CLEGG GOVERNMENT HAS PASSED SIXTY FIVE HOME 
AFFAIRS BILLS TODAY WE HAVE 
ANOTHER SIX MORE IF LEGISLATION 
WERE TO MAKE US SAFER WE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN THE SAFEEST NATION ON THE 
FACE OF THE PLANET YEARS AGO THE 
N. H. S. SHOVED FROM PILLAR TO POST IS 
GETTING A FOURTEENTH A FOURTEENTH REFORM BILL 
IN TEN YEARS 
LATER GORDON BROWN 
VISITED SOUTH LONDON TO START WHAT 
HE SAYS SHOULD BE A NATIONAL DEBATE 
ON HIS PROPOSED PROGRAMME WHICH 
INCLUDES MEASURES ON EDUCATION AND 
HOUSING RIGHTS TO BECOME AN 
APPRENTICE BELIEVE IT OR NOT AND 
GIVING AGENCY WORKERS THE SAME 
RIGHTS AS NORMAL STAFF 
YOU DON'T NEED ME TO TELL YOU THAT 
MOST OF THIS AND THE MEASURE ON 
AGENCY WORKERS ESPECIALLY SHOULD 
PLEASE LABOUR'S UNION FRIENDS AS 
TODAY COMBINED WITH YESTERDAY WAS 
DESIGNED TO APPEAL LABOUR VOTERS 
AND BACKBENCHERS 
PERHAPS IT'S THE SPRING WEATHER 
BUT CERTAINLY LABOUR M. P.'S ARE A LOT 
MORE CHEERFUL TODAY THERE'S NO 
LONGER THE SENSE OF FEAR HERE AT 
WESTMINSTER THAT THEY'RE ALL ABOUT 
TO BE FIRED BY THE VOTERS BUT 
THERE'S ALSO AN UNDERLYING 
RECOGNITION THAT MANY OF THE 
PROBLEMS STILL REMAIN MR. BROWN'S 
CREDABILITY AND COMPETENCE THE 
LACK OF VISION AND COORDINATION AND 
ABOVE ALL OF COURSE THE SHAKY 
ECONOMY 
WHATEVER ELSE YOU MIGHT ECONOMY SAY ABOUT GORDON BROWN HE'S A 
SERIOUS MAN FOR SERIOUS TIMES HE 
DOESN'T HAVE THE SILKY SKILLS OF 
BLAIR OR CAMERON IF YOU WANT THAT 
KIND OF THING YOU BETTER LOOK 
ELSEWHERE IF YOU WANT SOMEONE OF 
REAL SUBSTANCE PROBABLE LIT PERSON 
OF BIGGEST SUBSTANCE IN BRITISH 
POLITICS YOU GET THIS KIND OF 
PROGRAMME YOU GET THESE MEASURES 
I THINK THEY'RE THE RIGHT ONES 
GRAHAM STRINGER HAS LONG BEEN ONE 
OF MR. BROWN'S GREATEST CRITICS THE THE DRAFT QUEEN'S SPEECH IS COMPLICATED 
LOTS OF THINGS IN IT MAY APPEAL TO 
LABOUR VOTERS IT WILL TAKE A LONG 
TIME TO GET THROW THEM THREW TO 
THEM WHAT LABOUR M. P.'S HAVE THEIR 
FINGERS CROSSED ABOUT IS WHETHER 
YESTERDAY'S REDUCTION IN TAX FOR 
LOWER PAID PEOPLE IS REALLY GOING 
TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE 
LABOUR PARTY IS ON THEIR SIDE AGAIN 
AND IF VOTERS DELIVER ANOTHER SIR 
ALAN SUGAR STYLE VERDICT IN THE 
CREWE BY ELECTION WEEK ON 
THURSDAY THE GRUMBLING AGAINST MR. 
BROWN COULD START ALL OVER AGAIN 
ONLY THEN HE'LL ALMOST HAVE 
EXHAUSTED HIS LARDER OF GOODIES 
IT WAS A SPEECH HEAVILY FOCUSED ON 
MEASURES TO MEET AN ECONOMIC DOWN 
TURN BY COINCIDENCE THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND HAD ISSUED REPORT 
OUTLINING HOW BAD THAT MIGHT GET 
PAUL MASON IS HERE HOW BAD THE THE BEAUTY OF A BANK OF ENGLAND 
INFLATION REPORT IS IT GIVES YOU A 
TWO YEAR PREDICTION IF THIS IS THE 
START OF A TWO YEAR FIGHT BACK BY 
GORDON BROWN THE BANK'S REPORT 
TELLS US WHAT THE TERRAIN OF THAT 
FIGHT BACK LOOKS LIKE AND IT'S 
BUMPY WE'RE GOING TO LOOK NOW AT 
THE GROWTH FORECAST HERE'S HOW THE 
BANK DRAWS IT 
THE GROWTH FORECAST HERE'S HOW THE BANK DRAWS IT 
THERE'S A DROP OF GROWTH TO ONE PER CENT BY 
CHRISTMAS THE GOOD NEWS FOR GORDON 
BROWN IS IT BOUNCES BACK TO TREND 
BY THE TIME HE THINKS OF ELECTION 
IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND TEN THE BAD NEWS IS IT'S 
WAY OUT COMPARED TO THE 
GOVERNMENT'S OWN PREDICTION IF THE 
CENTRAL PREDICTION OF THE BANK IS 
RIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROBLEMS 
IN BALANCING THE PUBLIC FINANCES 
AND IS IT A RECESSION NO IT ISN'T 
THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK TODAY 
SOUNDED LIKE HE HAD RECESSION ON 
HIS MIND 
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT AT 
SOME POINT WE MAY GET ANOTHER 
QUARTER OF TWO OF NEGATIVE GROWTH 
RECESSION IS NOT THE CENTRAL 
PROJECTION AT ALL BUT CLEARLY 
FURTHER SHOCKS COULD PUSH US IN 
THAT DIRECTION 
WHAT ABOUT INFLATION 
THE INFLATION 
OUTLOOK IS TERRIBLE THE BANK'S OWN 
GRAPH WILL SHOW US THAT IT EXPECTS 
INFLATION TO RISE TO THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT BY LATE 
SUMMER 
SUMMER THAT'S THE CENTRAL 
PREDICTION IT MAY GO HIGHER THE 
BIT WHERE IT FALLS BACK ON THE 
GRAPH IS NOT BRILLIANT FOR 
CONASSUMESERS IT MEANS THAT THE 
HIGH PRICES OF THIS SUMMER ARE 
LOCKED IN AND PRICES RISE SLOWER 
MERVYN KING WILL HAVE TO WRITE TO 
THE CHANCELLOR SAYING WE'VE BROKEN 
THE RULES SORRY ABOUT THAT HE 
SAID TODAY LOOK WE'RE AT THE END 
OF THE NICE 
DECADE IF THERE'S 
GOING TO BE A DEBATE ABOUT THE 
GOVERNMENT LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 
ONE LOT OF ECONMISTS WOULD LIKE IS 
A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THESE RULES 
IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUALLY 
BUSTED THROUGH BOTH ON INFLATION AN 
THE GOVERNMENT'S TOUCHING THE TOP 
OF ITS CEILING ON BORROWING 
WHETHER THE RULES SHOULD BE 
RETHOUGHT 
WE CAN'T BE CERTAIN RETHOUGHT THAT'S AS BAD AS IT WILL GET IT IT MAY GET WORSE IF WE'RE TRYING TO 
PULL A THEME OUT OF AN ECONOMIC 
THEME OUT OF THE SPEECH TODAY ONE 
PHRASE STICKS IN MY MIND HE USED 
THE PHRASE ECONOMIC PLAN HE 
PROMISED TO UNVEIL ONE HE'S 
WRITTEN TO LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS 
TONIGHT PROMISING TO INTERVENE 
WHERE NECESSARY TO EASE THE PAIN OF 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH THE THEME THAT 
LABOUR WANTS TO COME OUT OF THAT 
SPEECH TONIGHT IS FAIRNESS WE'RE 
THE PARTY THAT'S GOING TO LOOK 
AFTER YOU IF IT ALL GOES WRONG 
ECONOMICALLY ONE SENIOR LABOUR 
FIGURE TOLD ME TONIGHT THEY WANT IT 
FAR CLEARER THEY WANT IT MORE 
COHERENTLY THAN AT PRESENT 
WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE SECRETARY 
OF STATE FOR INNOVATION 
UNIVERSITIES AND SKILLS JOHN DENHAM 
BY THE SHADOW MINISTER FOR WORK AND 
PENSIONS CHRIS GRAYLING AND VINCE 
CABLE IT'S HARD TO SEE THE 
OVERARCHING THEME OF ALL OF THIS 
THAT'S NOT TRUE IF YOU LOOK AT 
WHAT WE'RE DOING THERE'S A SERIES 
OF MEASURES TO TAKE US THROUGH AND 
THE FAMILIES OF THIS COUNTRY 
THROUGH THE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC 
TIMES THERE ARE A SERIES OF 
MEASURES IN THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT 
PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET 
THE JOB THAT'S WILL BE THERE IN THE 
FUTURE FROM TACKLING STANDARDS IN 
SCHOOLS TO GIVING PEOPLE BEST 
RIGHTS TO TRAINING 
WHAT'S THE BIG 
IDEA 
THE BIG IDEA IS TO GET IDEA THROUGH THE CURRENT ECONOMIC 
DIFFICULTIES AND TO CONTINUE TO 
BUILD A SOCIETY IN WHICH PEOPLE 
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WHICH 
THEY DO NOW IN GREATER NUMBERS THAN 
EVER BEFORE TO HAVE THE SKILLS OF 
THE JOBS FOR THE FUTURE AND TO 
ENJOY PUBLIC SERVICE THAT'S ARE 
RESPONSIVE TO WHAT PEOPLE WANT AND 
WHERE WE ARE CLEARLY TACKLING 
ANYTHING UNACCEPTABLE THAT IS A 
VERY GOOD THING FOR GOVERNMENT'S TO 
DO IT MAY NOT BE SPECTACULAR IT'S 
ADDRESSING WHAT THE FAMILIES OF 
THIS COUNTRY WANT 
YOU PRESUMABLY 
ARE CHUFFED YOU LIKE THIS BIG IDEA 
YOU SAY THAT TWELVE OF THESE BILLLES 
WERE YOUR IDEAS ANY WAY 
THE WELFARE REFORM ELEMENT WE PUT 
THAT FORWARD IN JANUARY THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL FOR THE NATIONAL 
HEALTH SERVICE WE SAW YESTERDAY AN 
EMERGENCY BUDGET TODAY WE HAVE A 
DRAFT QUEEN SPEECH SIX MONTHS 
BEFORE THE QUEEN SPEECH WE HAVE 
NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE 
WE HAVE HAD DRAFT QUEEN'S SPEECH 
BEFORE 
NOT IN MAY 
WE PROM SUSSED BEFORE IT LAST YEAR AS SOON AS GORDON 
CAME IN LAST YEAR WE SAID NEXT YEAR 
WE WILL DO IT EARLIER THERE IS 
NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS 
WE HAVE 
NINE MONTHS LEFT OF THE CURRENT 
SESSION IT FEELS LIKE A DAMAGE 
LIMITATION EXERCISE THIS IS A 
DESPERATE ATOFRPLT RESEIZE THE NEWS 
AGENCY HE PUT TOGETHER A MIX OF 
IDEAS TAKEN FROM THE CONSERVATIVES 
IDEA THAT PUT RIGHT THE BANKING 
REGULATION PROCESS HE GOT WRONG AND 
THINGS HE ANNOUNCED ALREADY HAD 
DOESN'T ADD UP TO A HILL OF BEANS 
ARE YOU PERSUADED BY IT 
THERE IS 
FAR TOO MUCH LEGISLATION 
THAT IS 
GOVERNMENTS GENERALLY 
THIS GOV 
SUSPECT ANAMORED OF NEW LEGISLATION 
AND NEW LAWS ARE ACTION SOME OF 
THE STUFF IS SENSIBLE MARINE 
CONSERVATION THE CORONERS BILL WE 
ARGUED FOR THIS 
ALL THE STUFF BU BU BUT IF YOU TAKE THE HOME OFFICE 
BILL THERE IS ANOTHER FIVE THE 
GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED THREE THOUSAND NEW 
CRIMINAL OFFENCES TWO FOR EVERY 
WORKING DAY OF PARLIAMENT THIS IS 
NOT WHAT PEOPLE HAVE LOOKING FOR 
IN TERMS OF LAW AND ORDER 
LEGISLATION INSTEAD OF ACTION TAKE TAKE SOMETHING SPECIFIC LIKE HOUSING 
MONEY IS BEING TALKED ABOUT HOW 
MANY HOUSES COULD BE BOUGHT WITH 
THAT MONEY 
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY 
ONE THOUSAND IT'S PEANUTS 
THE MEASURES 
TAKEN THAT OPEN UP THE SHARED 
OWNERSHIP MOD TOL LOADS OF PEOPLE 
WHO HAVEN'T HAD PREVIOUSLY IT HAS 
TO BE PUT TOGETHER WITH TWO OTHER 
THINGS 
A BIG SONG AND DANCE ABOUT THINGS THE MONEY SUFFICIENT TO BUY 
POSSIBLY TWO THOUSAND HOUSES 
YOU SIMPLY 
MUSN'T DISMISS OUT OF HAND THE EIGHT 
BILLION HOUSING PROGRAMME THAT THAT 
IS UNDER WAY WHICH HAS BEEN 
BLOCKED BY TORY COUNCILS UP AND 
DOWN THE COUNTRY THE MONEY BEING 
TAKEN TO INCREASE THE LIQUIDITY 
THERE FOR LENDERS IT'S NOT RIGHT 
TO TAKE OUT ONE MEASURES WHICH ON 
ITS OWN IS IMPORTANT BUT 
YOU TOOK 
IT OUT YOU ARE THE PEOPLE WHO SAID 
THERE IS GOING TO BE TWO HUNDRED MILLION 
FOR THIS 
IT'S RIGHT TO HIGHLIGHT 
THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION 
TAKE IT OUT YOU YOU CAN'T TAKE IT OUT OF THE CONTEXT OF 
THE REST OF IT IF YOU SAID THE 
ONLY THING THE GOV SUSPECT DOING ON 
HOUSING IS THAT IT WOULDN'T BE 
ADEQUATE 
THIS IS THE PROBLEM YOU ADEQUATE YOU ARE TACKLING THE HOUSING PROBLEM 
WE ARE GETTING BITS AND PIECES HERE 
AND THERE DESIGNED TO GET HEAD 
LEANS ON AN INDIVIDUAL DAY THERE 
IS NO OVERARCHING VISION THERE IS 
NO CLEAR END POINT NO SENSE OF REAL 
DIRECTION IT'S ABOUT SHORT TERM 
POLITICAL TACTICS 
THESE ARE TOL 
STOLEN IDEAS YOU WON'T VOTE AGAINST 
THEM HOW MANY BILLS WILL YOU 
SUPPORT 
WE WILL SUPPORT THE IDEAS SUPPORT WE BROUGHT FORWARD OURSELVES AND 
THE GOVERNMENT HAVE TAKEN 
TWELVE BILLS 
YOU WILL SUPPORT 
MY CONCERN IT'S IT'S NOT TRUE 
TWELVE OF THESE BILLS WILL 
YOU SUPPORT 
THE IDEA WE BROUGHT 
FORWARD OURSELVES 
THE RELIEF 
PERHAPS FOR CHRIS IS PLEASE IT'S PLEASE IT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE WEFPLT ACCEPT HE IS 
A BIG PROBLEM THE HOUSING SLUMP 
WILL HAVE ENORMOUS QUONSQUENSS THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS COME UP WITH A GOOD 
IDEA THAT THE PUBLIC SECTOR SHOULD 
BUY PROPERTY IN A COLLAPSING MARKET 
IN ORDER TO LET REPO KETION SESSION 
NOT TO GET OUT OF CONTROL GOOD 
CONCEPT REVERSES THE RIGHT TO BUY 
A LITTLE BIT AS YOU RIGHTLY SAID 
THE NUMBERS MEAN WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT ONE THOUSAND HOUSES OVER THE NEXT 
FEW YEARS CONTEXT WHERE NEXT YEAR 
THERE WILL WILL BE AT LEAST FIFTY THOUSAND 
REPOSSESSIONS IT'S TINY TINY DROP 
IN A BIG OCEAN 
ONE OTHER QUESTION 
IN THIS AREA OF ECONOMICS WHICH IS 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S COMMENTS 
TODAY ABOUT INFLATION ALL THESE 
GUIDELINES ABOUT THE LEVEL OF 
PUBLIC BORROWING AND THE INFLATION 
TARGET WAS SET BY THIS GOVERNMENT 
IN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU 
YOU THINK WILL IS A CASE NOW FOR 
REVISING THEM 
THE REAL TRIBUTE TO 
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE WE 
WERE PREPARED TO SET TIGHT TARGETS 
HANG ON MATE IS THERE A CASE FOR 
REVISING THEM PERSONALLY IT'S NOT 
MY RESPONSIBILITY I'M NOT 
PERSUADED THERE IS L. WILL TELL YOU 
WHY TEN YEARS AGO IF WE HAD THE 
DISCUSSION IT MIGHT BE THIRTY FIVE PER CENT PEOPLE 
WOULD HAVE SAID FANTASTIC THAT IS 
THE LOWEST WE HAVE HAD FOR AGES IT 
IS BECAUSE WE CAME IN ONE OF THE 
THINGS WE SET WAS A TIGHT 
DISCIPLINE HON WHAT WE WANTED TO 
ACHIEVE 
THAT IS NOT WHERE WE ARE 
NOW 
I DON'T THINK AT THE MOMENT NOW VINCE CABLE 
WHEN YOU ACCEDE YOUR 
TARGET YOU SAY LET'S GIVE UP ON IT 
YOU HAVE ANSWERED THE QUESTION 
COME ON 
THE RULES GORDON BROWN SET 
OUT ARE SOUND SMALL MODIFICATION 
YOU WOULDN'T CHANGE THEM 
A LITTLE 
INFLATION TAKE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
HOUSING 
WHAT WOULD YOU THREAT GO HOUSING TO TWO PER CENT NOW THE TARGET WHAT SHOULD 
IT BE 
BANK OF ENGLAND SHOULD LOOK 
AT HOUSE PRICES S. W. M. AS NORMAL 
INFLATION AND MAKES JUDGEMENT 
ACCORDLY 
WHAT IS THE FIGURE ACCORDLY CONVINCE 
PROVIDING THEY ARE CONVINCE INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THE PROBLEM 
IS NOT THE RULES NO POINT BLAMING 
THE RULES AND FRAME WORK THE WAY 
THEY ARE BEING OBJECT SERVED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT THE DAMAGE DONE 
YESTERDAY WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON 
THE TEN P. RATE WAS TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION WAS 
BROUGHT UP FROM NOWHERE DEFERED 
GOV IT WILL CREATE ENORMOUS 
PROBLEMS FOR THE FISCAL RULES AND 
THE ECONOMY 
WHAT WILL YOU DO YOU YOU DON'T DO 
NOT WHAT YOU DON'T DO 
WHAT YOU WOULD DO 
YOU DON'T CHANGE 
THE RULES YOU SET TEN YEARS AGO 
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND YOU DON'T SUDDENLY SAY 
BECAUSE TIMES ARE TOUGH YOU DON'T 
SUDDENLY SAY LET'S LET RIP LET'S 
LET EVERYTHING LOOSE 
ANOTHER THING 
YOU SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT ON YOU 
ARE A LOYAL ALLY THESE DAYS 
ABSOLUTELY THE REAL DIFFICULTY IS 
THEY SPENT THE MONEY IN THE GOOD 
TIMES IF YOU LOOK AT THE UNITED 
STATES WHERE THEY ARE DELIVERING 
SUBSTANTIAL TAX CUTS AT A TIME WHEN 
THEIR ECONOMY IS ON THE DOWN TURN 
WE HAVE NO MONEY IN THE KITTY THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS TO BORROW TO DELIVER 
THE CHANGES THEY DID YESTERDAY 
THEY HAVE NOTHING LEFT FOR THE BAD 
TIMES THAT IS THE CHALSWRENGE 
CHALLENGE WE HAVE NOW YOU CAN HEAR 
AN INTERVIEW WITH GORDON BROWN ON 
THE TODAY PROGRAMME THIS IS A 
TERRIBLE TIME FOR NATURAL DISASTERS 
TENS OF THOUSANDS DEAD IN CHINA 
TENS OF THOUSANDS MAYBE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
DEAD IN BURMA IN ONE CASE AN 
EARTHQUAKE AND ONE CASE CYCLONE 
IN THE CASE OF THE BURMESE SIGH CON 
CLONE REST OF THE WORLD MUST DRUM 
IT'S FINGERS THE MILITARY REGIME 
BLOCKS AID THAT COULD SAVE LIVES 
WHILE THE CASUALTIES MAY BE HIGHER 
THAN THOSE WHO DIED IN THE TSUNAMI 
THE APPEALED FOR DONATIONS FOR AID 
HAS RAISED A TEN F. T. OF THE SUM 
GATHERED FOR THAT CATASTROPHE WHY 
THIS REPORT CONTAINS SOME 
DISTURBING IMAGES 
ASTONISHINGLY LIVES ARE STILL BEING 
SAVED TWOFPLT DAYS AFTER THE 
EARTHQUAKE STRUCK CHINA'S MASSIVE 
RESCUE EFFORT CONDITIONS WELL 
RESOURCED AND EFFICIENT IT IS 
DEALING AS WELL AS ANY COUNTRY 
MIGHT THE SCALE OF THIS DISASTER 
IS STILL IMMENSE FORTY THOUSAND ARE DEAD 
MISSING OR BURIED UNDER THE RUBBLE 
FEW DOUBT THAT THE FINAL DEATH TOLL 
WILL BE MUCH HIGHER THE SECOND 
DISASTER TO HIT THIS REGION IN THE 
SPACE OF A FORTNIGHT 
THESE TWO 
DISASTERS PUT TOGETHER ARE 
EXCEPTION NAL THEMSELVES THE FACT 
THEY HAPPENED AT THE SAME TIME THE 
FACT THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
SKILLED SO ENORMOUS AND THE IMPACT 
WIDER IS PHENOMENAL PEOPLE HAVE TO 
REALISE THIS IS SOMETHING VERY 
SPECIAL AND VERY UNUSUAL 
TWELVE DAYS AFTER THE CYCLONE HIT BURMA 
BRITISH GOVERNMENT FIGURES SUGGEST 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE DEAD AND MISSING 
AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION HAVE BEEN AFFECTED 
TODAY WAS THE FIRST U. K. AID FLIGHT 
GIVEN PERMISSION TO ENTER OFFERS 
OF HELP FROM THE THAI GOVERNMENT 
ONE OF THE FEW FRIENDS OF THE 
REGIME WERE REJECTED WITH 
PREDICTIONS OF ANOTHER CYCLONE 
FORMING OFF THE BURMESE COAST THE 
SITUATION COULD NOT LOOK BLEAKER 
IT'S BECOMING CLEAR THAT THE DEATH 
TOLL IN BURMA AND CHIEN MAYBE AS 
HIGH THAT OF ASIA'S RECENT CALAMITY 
THE TSUNAMI OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE DISASTERS 
EMERGENCY COMMITTEE APPEAL FOR 
BURMA HAS RAISED SIX MILLION IN THE 
FIRST WEEK SIXTY MILLION WAS RAISED 
IN THE FIRST SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE 
TSUNAMI WHY THE DISPARITY DO WE 
SIMPLY CARE LESS IS THE SITUATION 
MORE COMPLICATED IN THE COMMONS 
TODAY THERE WAS FRUSTRATION THE 
GOVERNMENT HASN'T RESPONDED QUICKLY 
ENOUGH TO THE BURMESE CRISIS THE THE BEST STEP IS TO GET THE GOVERNMENT 
TO OPEN UP THE COUNTRY TO ALLOW THE 
AID AGENCIES IN L. DO THINK IT IS 
WORTH SETTING A DEADLINE BY WHICH 
WE SAY ENOUGH ISN'T THROUGH AND 
MORE SHOULD BE DONE YES OF COURSE 
THE EXPERTS SAY WITH DIRECT AID 
ONLY A FIFTH OF IT WILL GET THROUGH 
A FIFTH OF SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN 
ZERO PER CENT OF NOTHING 
THE KEY THING AT 
THE MOMENT IS TO PRESSURE THE 
REGIME BY ALL COUNTRIES IN ASIA 
UNITING WITH ALL OF US TO MAKE SURE 
AID GETS TO THE PEOPLE OF BURMA AS 
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
THIS CRISIS IS 
COMPETING WITH A SERIES OF PROBLEMS 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT HERE AT HOME 
SOME QUESTION WHETHER LABOUR'S 
FEVER FOR INTERVENING IN THE 
WORLD'S TROUBLE SPOTS IS SLIPPING 
AWAY 
THE LABOUR PARTY IS SPORN AWAY TORN GORDON BROWN AND DOUGLAS 
ALEXANDER WHO ARE ESSENTIALLY 
FOLLOWING LITTLEKM ENGLAND STRATEGY 
WHO DON'T REALLY WANT ANYTHING TO 
DO WITH ANY OF THIS ON THE OTHER 
HAND YOU CAN SEE DAVID MILIBAND IN 
THE FOREIGN OFFICE WHO IS A 
BLAIRITE WHO SAYS WE HAVE A DUTY TO 
PROTECT A DUTY TO INTERVENE IF 
SOVEREIGN STATES ARE COMMITTING 
BARRICHELLO ABG ACTS WE WANT TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT THE TENSIONS 
AROUND IRAQ AND KOSOVO WITHIN THE 
LEFT ARE COMING OUT AGAIN 
FOR THE 
MEDIA THE DISASTERS IN CHINA AND 
BURMA UNLIKE DURING THE TSUNAMI 
HAVE ALSO HAD TO COMPETE FOR COLUMN 
INITIALS AND AIR TIME WITH OTHER 
ISSUES CLOSER TO HOME MANY 
NEWSPAPERS HAVE NOT LED ON EITHER 
BURMA OR CHINA AT ALL OVER THE PAST 
ELEVEN DAYS THERE HAS NOT BEEN ONE 
FRONT PAGE STORY IN THE MAIL 
EXPRESS OR THE MIRROR THERE HAS 
BEEN ONE SUN FRONT PAGE ON BURMA 
THE TIMES HAS LEAD ON BURMA AND 
CHINA THREE TIMES WITH MORE 
PROMINENCE IN THE TELL KPWRAF 
TELEGRAPH AND INDEPENDENT AND 
GUARDIAN 
JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN GUARDIAN UNABLE TO GO EXPLORING FOR STORIES 
AS THEY LIKE FOR MANY IT IS A 
SECOND HAND STORY ANY WAY NOT MUCH 
TWIST TO IT THE TWISTS THAT ARE 
THERE PERHAPS AREN'T THE HUMAN SIDE 
THAT BUT THEY ARE POLITICAL SIDE 
THAT MANY PEOPLE WON'T GET THE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT FOR THE AID 
AGENCIES IS LESS MONEY FROM THE 
PUBLIC 
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THE PUBLIC AID WILL GET THROUGH IF YOU HAVE 
MEN MEN WITH GUN AS AT RANGOON 
AIRPORT CONFISCATING THE FOOD FROM 
THE FLIGHTS THAT ARE ALLOWED IN 
WHY GIVE MONEY THAT IS A SIMPLETON 
OF THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS WHAT 
DO YOU DO WITH A REGIME WHICH IS SO 
CON TEMPIOUS OF ITS OWN PEOPLE IT 
WON'T GIVE FOOD TO THE STARVING 
WHEN THAT FOOD IS ON OFFER FOR 
FREE 
IN CHINA 
THE RESPONSE FROM FREE THE AUTHORITIES MAY HAVE BEEN 
MARKEDLY DIFFERENT FROM BURMA BUT 
THE HUMAN TRAGEDIES FOR BOTH 
COUNTRIES ARE PAINFULLY SIMILAR 
WITH US IN THE STUDIO NOW BRENDAN 
GORMLEY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THEDIES 
ASTERS EMERGENCY COMMITTEE AND 
SIMON JENKINS THE NEWSPAPER 
COLUMNIST FROM THE GUARDIAN 
THE RESPONSE THE MONEY RAISED SIX 
MILLION AS AGAINST SIXTY MILLION 
TSUNAMI SO FAR WHY SO 
AFTER THE TSUNAMI SO FAR WHY SO SMALL 
FIRSTLY WE DON'T DO SMALL COMPARISONS EVERY CRISIS IS A 
TRAGEDY IN ITS OWN RIGHT WE AS THE 
DISASTERS EMERGENCY COMMITTEE ARE 
HAPPY TO HAVE WHATEVER THE BRITISH 
PUBLIC ARE WILLING TO GIVE US YOU YOU MUST ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION 
THOUGH 
YOU ARE RIGHT IF ONE THOUGH COMPARES WITH DARFUR OR BANGLADESH 
LAST YEAR WE ARE RAISING MORE THAN 
WE DID AT THIS TIME FOR THOSE TWO 
IF IT'S TRYING TO COMPARE WITH 
TSUNAMI WE ARE IN A COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT BALL GAME SEVEN 
COUNTRIES A LOT OF U. K. INTEREST IT 
WAS OUR KIT AND KIN ON HOLIDAY WE 
WERE SITLING ON OUR SOFAS ON BOXING 
DAY IT WAS A DIFFERENT SORT OF 
STORY 
HOW IMPORTANT IS MEDIA STORY COVERAGE 
HUGE ABSOLUTELY IT'S COVERAGE ALSO PICTURES AND I THINK AS WE 
HEARD IN THE CLIP THE PROBLEM IS 
IF THE PICTURES AREN'T THERE IT IS 
VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL THAT STORY 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO EXCLUED 
THE MEDIA IT'S RATHER EFFECTIVE 
ISN'T IT 
EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE GO 
BACK TO CROATIA TO KOSOVO THE 
PRESS WERE THERE THE PICTURES WERE 
ON THE TELEVISION WE EPBT WENT IN 
WE DIDN'T ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW 
MANY TROOPS MAY BE FACING US WE 
WENT IN HERE WITH ARE NOT GOING IN 
WHY BECAUSE THE MEDIA AREN'T 
THERE 
WHEN DAVID CAMERON STARTS THERE TALKING ABOUT PARACHUTING AID IN 
IS THAT A VIEW THAT YOU WOULD 
SUPPORT 
WELL I'M NOT LOGISTICAL SUPPORT EXPERT BROADLY SPEAKING I WOULD 
INTERVENE YES FORCIBLE FORCIBLE INTERVENTION IF NECESSARY FORCIBLE FORCIBLE MEANS GOING IN THE AMERICANS WERE 
RANGOON AIRPORT ON MONDAY SHIPS 
OFFSHORE TWO DOZEN HELICOPTERS 
MASSES OF AID THEY ARE SITTING 
WAITING AT SEA WHILE PEOPLE ARE 
DYING ASHORE L. CANNOT BELIEVE THIS 
GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE ADOPTED THIS 
ATTITUDE IF THIS WAS IN EUROPE OR 
EVEN IN AFRICA WE WENT ON SHORE IN 
SEE EAR YA ALONE IN THIS CASE WILL 
IS NO QUESTION OF TOPPLING THE 
REGIME WE ARE TWO THREE FOUR OH NINE TRYING TO 
ACHIEVE A POLITICAL GOAL WE ARE 
TRYING TO SAVE LIVES WE ARE 
COMPLETELY HAPPY ABOUT DOING IT IN 
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND KOSOVO 
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM IN BURMA DO DO YOU GET A SENSE THERE HAS BEEN A 
CHANGE OF ATTITUDE WITH A CHANGE OF 
PRIME MINISTER 
I DON'T THINK SO L. 
HAVE TO SAY I THINK THAT THE THE 
LIBERAL INTERVENTION IS AN 
OPPORTUNITYIST IDEOLOGY WE DO IT 
IN SOME PLACES AND NOT OTHER PLACES 
IN THIS PLACE NO BIG TELEVISION 
INTEREST A LONG WAY AWAY 
SOMETHING ABOUT BURMA SEEMS A 
DISTANT PLACE WE ARE LOOKING VERY 
DOUBLE STANDARD AT THE MOMENT 
CURIOUSLY THE FACT THAT CAN YOU 
SEE PICTURES OF THE CHINESE 
EARTHQUAKE AND YOU CAN SEE THE 
CHINESE AUTHORITIES BEHAVING IN A 
WAY WE HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM BEHAVE 
BEFORE THE CHINESE WHO ARE 
AFFECTED BY IT ARE HUMAN BEINGS 
LIKE THE REST OF US DOES AFFECT HOW 
YOU REGARD THAT VERY REGIME WHICH 
IS EQUALLY REPELLANT IN SOME OF ITS 
ASPECT 
SLUEPTLY SO THEY ARE ASPECT COPING THE BURMESE HAVE A SPECIFIC 
INTEREST IN NOT COPING THEY DON'T 
WANT ANYBODY THERE THIS THEORY ALL 
WE SHOULD DO IS PUT DIPLOMATIC 
PRESSURE ON THEM IS ABSURD IT 
WOULD HAVE NO FROM IMPACT AT ALL 
CAN YOU HAVE FORCIBLE HUMANITARIAN 
AID 
THERE ARE GOOD EXAMPLES WHERE AID NEGOTIATED ACCESS BACKED BY FORCE 
AND THE UN HAS WORKED NEGOTIATIONS NEGOTIATIONS HAVE FAILED IN THIS CASE SO FAR 
YES TO JUST IT IS A WERE TO DROP 
FROM A GREAT HEIGHT IS DANGEROUS 
NOT VERY EFFICIENT L. WOULD THINK 
MY CONCERN WOULD BE THAT IT COULD 
PUT AT RISK THAT CAREFULLY 
NEGOTIATED SPACE THAT DOES IT IS 
TINY BUT THE CHARITIES ARE THERE 
THEY ARE PROBABLY THE ONLY PEOPLE 
DELIVERING AND IF WE IMPOSE 
SOMETHING YOU DO NOUGHT AT RISK 
THERE WAS ONE BRITISH FLIGHT THAT 
WENT IN TODAY WASN'T THERE

REVIEW OF THE FUTURE OF POSTAL 
SERVICES THAT'S SET UP BY THE 
GOVERNMENT THE CHAIRMAN OF 
POSTCOMM SAID IN THE B. B. C. NEWS 
INTERVIEW THAT PART PRIVATISATION 
WOULD BRING A RANGE OF BENEFITSITY 
THE MOST OBVIOUS ROUTE TO 
EFFICIENCY IS EITHER MORE 
AUTOMATION OR SHRINKING YOUR 
BUSINESS TO THE LOWER VOLUMES THAT 
YOU'RE NOW HANDLING BOTH OF THOSE 
NEED MORE K. A. L. TAP BUT SECONDLY 
INCENTIVES ARE VERY DIFFERENT WHEN 
THERE IS THE DISCIPLINE OF IT 
ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO TODAY THE PLACE 
WHERE WE WERE SITTING WAS A HUGE 
LAGOON YOU COULD ONLY GET TO THIS 
POINT BY PAYING SIX PENCE ON A 
PEDALO WHITE CITY WHERE THE B. B. C. 
STUDIOS ARE TAKES THE NAME BY A 
GREAT WHITE CITY AN EXTRAORDINARY 
COLLECTION OF THE WHITE BUILDINGS 
THAT MADE UP THE FRANCO BRITISH 
EXHIBITION WE TALK ABOUT THE HARM 
ANY OF BRITAIN AND FRANCE 
WHERE NOW THEY COME TO WATCH 
STRICTLY COME DANCING ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
YEARS AGO THE LURE WAS A VISTA OF 
ARCHITECTURE FOLLOWLIES 
FOLLIES 
LONDON'S IN A MAIZE 
WITH ITS LATEST CRAZE EVER EUROMELANOMA DAY WE FIGHT 
AND PUSH 
ON A MOTOR BUS TO CLIMB 
TWENTY SEVEN AT A TIME 
OR TAKE THE GOOD OLD TUBE TO 
SHEPHERD'S BUSH 
MM THIS LANDSCAPE WAS THE FRANCO 
BRITISH EXHIBITION THERE WAS 
PALACES AND PAFLYANS CANALS AND 
LAGOONS THIS WAS VENICE PARIS 
EVEN DELHI NOT THE FRINGE OF 
EDWARDIAN LONDON 
TODAY WHITE CITY IS NOT THE MOST 
EXTRAORDINARY BIT OF WEST LONDON 
IT WAS HARD IT WAS ONCE A 
BEAUTIFULLY LANDSCAPED URBAN 
PARKLAND FROM HERE YOU GET AN IDEA 
OF THE SHEER SCALE OF THE PROJECT 
THE WHOLE SITE WAS EIGHT TIMES AS 
BIG AS THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY ONE GREAT EXHIBITION 
IT TOOK TWELVE THOUSAND MEN TO BUILD IT ALL 
WORKING ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT WHEN 
IT OPENED A TOTAL OF EIGHTY FIVE MILLION 
PEOPLE CAME TO SEE IT THAT'S A 
MILLION MORE THAN THE POPULATION OF 
LONDON AT THE TIME IT WAS THE 
FRENCH WHO ORIGINALLY CAME ONE THE 
IDEA OF CELEBRATING THE ENTENTE 
CORDIALE OF NINETEEN OH FOUR BY HOLD AGO HUGE 
EXHIBITION TO INCREASE TRADE WITH 
BRITAIN IT WAS A UNIQUE EXPERIMENT 
IN CUSTOMERS THROUGH PEACE THERE 
WOULD BE NOTHING LIKE IT PREVIOUSLY 
GREATER SPECTACLES EGGS BIGGSS AND 
TALKS WERE FASHIONABLE THERE WAS A 
WHOLE SERIES OF THEM WORLD FAIRS 
IN AMERICA AND EXTRAORDINARY 
SPECTACULAR EXHIBITIONS WHERE 
PEOPLE REBUILT INDIA IN EARL'S 
COURT FOR EXAMPLE BUT THE IDEA OF 
PUTTING ON AN EXHIBITION WHICH 
CELEBRATED UNION BETWEEN TWO 
COUNTRIES WAS COMPLETELY NEW THE THE FRENCH BUSINESSMEN MUST HAVE SAID 
WELL WE HAVE ALL THESE MARVELLOUS 
PRODUCT OUR INTERNAL MARKET IS TOO 
SMALL WE DON'T EXPORT WELL IN 
OTHER COUNTRIES WHY NOT GO ON THE 
IN THE WAKE OF THAT POLITICAL 
AGREEMENT LET'S BRING SUBSTANCE TO 
IT AND THERE YOU HAVE HAD INVASION 
OF FRENCH PRODUCT WHICH TODAY ARE 
STILL VERY WELL KNOWN LIKE 
CHAMPAGNE AND PERRIER AND FASHION 
AND FINE ART AND THE VISION OF 
FRANCE WHICH TODAY MANY BRITISH 
HAVE IS STILL THE ONE OF NINETEEN OH EIGHT THE THE EXHIBITION WAS OPENED BY THE PRINCE 
OF WALES EXACTLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
TODAY IT RAINED NON STOP PEOPLE 
POWERED INTO A HUNDRED TRADE 
PAVILIONS BRITISH SHOWED OFF 
LAYERS AND TURBINES FROM THE 
COLONIES THERE WAS ODDITIES LIKE 
CANADIAN BUTTER SKOCHES IN 
REFRIGERATED CLASS CASES 
THIS WAS 
ALL PART OF THE EXHIBITION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT 
THEY BUILT THESE HOUSES DONALD DONALD KNIGHT KNOWSS MORE THAN ANYONE HOW 
THE AREA USED TO LOOK HE TOOK ME 
ON A TOUR WHAT 
WAS THIS AREA THIS THIS WAS WHERE THE PALACE OF ARTS IT WAS QUITE A THEME TO GO IN AND SEE 
ALL THE LOVELY PICTURES 
THERE WAS 
ALL THE LOVELY PICTURES THERE WAS PRICELESS MASTERPIECES ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY THIS WAS THE MAIN ENTRANCE IN WOOD 
LANE TO THE EXHIBITION 
LOOK AT IT 
NOW 
THE INSIDE WAS QUITE ORNATE NOW THEY HAD ALL THE FANCY PLASTER WORK 
PICKED OUT IN LOVELY COLOURS WE'RE 
ENTERING WHAT WAS THE COURT OF 
HONOUR THIS IS WHERE THE PEOPLE 
WOULD HAVE PAID THEIR SHILLING TO 
COME INTO THE EXHIBITION ALL WATER 
ALL THE BUILDINGS PAINT WHITE AND 
THEY JUST STOOD THERE AND GASPED 
WHITE CITY AND THAT'S HOW IT GOT 
ITS NICKNAME THIS AREA WAS BOGLAND 
SO THERE WAS WATER PLENTY OF WATER 
IN THE AREA THE BOATS WERE AMAZING 
BECAUSE THE MAN WHO SEPARATED THAT 
PEDALLED THAT THE MACHINE ALL THE 
WAY AROUND THE LAGOON 
AT NIGHT IT 
WAS ALL LIT UP HOW DID THEY MAKE 
THAT HAPPEN 
THERE WAS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND 
ELECTRIC LIGHT BULLYINGS IN THE 
COURT OF HONOUR THEY WOULD HAVE 
CLOSED AT ELEVEN AND THEY WOULD BE ON 
UNTIL TWELVE HUNDRED TO GET THE PEOPLE OUT 
OF THE EXHIBITION 
DO YOU WISH 
YOU'D HAVE SEEN IT 
I WOULD HAVE 
LOVED TO HAVE BEEN THERE 
SNOOP THE STADIUM FOR THE NINETEEN OH EIGHT 
OLYMPICS WAS SQUEEZED ON TO THE 
EXHIBITION SITE AFTER BRITAIN 
STEPPED IN TO HOST THEM AT SHORT 
NOTICE IT'S NOW ANOTHER B. B. C. 
BUILDING TURNS OUT DONALD ISN'T 
THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS ABOUT 
THIS 
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT 
THE NINETEEN OH EIGHT THIS EXHIBITION AND OLYMPICS YEAH TELL YEAH TELL ME THEN 
BEFORE THE B. B. C. WAS MADE 
THERE 
THERE THERE WAS A BIG STADIUM 
THEY CALLED IT BEFORE THEY CALLED 
IT THE GREAT WHITE CITY 
AND THEY 
KNEW ABOUT THE SCARIEST AMUSEMENT 
RIDE AT THE EXHIBITION YOU'VE YOU'VE LEARNT ABOUT THE FLIP FLAP THERE THERE WAS A BIG RIDE FOR CHILDREN TO GO 
ON WHAT IT DOES WAS FLIP FLAPS 
IT FLAPS ALL AROUND 
HERE'S MY MODEL OF THE FLIP FLAP 
AT HIS HOME DONALD MADE HIS OWN 
FLIP FLAP MODEL 
IT DOESN'T WORK 
RIGHT EVERY TIME THEY WROTE THREE 
SONGS ABOUT THE FLIP FLAP AND 
THESE WERE SUNG AROUND THE MUSIC 
HALLS BUT ONE OF THEM GOES 
ONCE A PRETTY FRENCH GIRL 
BLANCH MARIE CAME ACROSS TO ENGLAND FROM PARIS TAKE ME ON THE FLIP FLAP DO DEAR DO IT LOOKS SO LOVELY DOWN BELOW SO YOU PAY YOUR MONEY AND UP YOU GO GO AND THOUGH A QUEER SENSATION YOU WISH IT WOULD NEVER STOP 
THERE WAS A SCENIC RAILWAY THAT 
TOOK YOU THROUGH RECONSTRUCTIONS OF 
THE WORLD'S MOST BREATHTAKING 
TERRAIN AND THE WILLING WOBBLE 
THE CAR RIDE WHICH GEORGE OR WE 
WILL EXPERIENCED AS A CHILD YET 
THERE WAS A LESS WHOLESOME SIDE TO 
CELEBRATE THE FRENCH AND BRITISH 
EMPIRES VILLAGERS FROM SENEGAL AND 
SRI LANKA WERE SHIPPED OVER TO 
RECREATE THEIR COMMUNITIES ON SITE 
TO ADD TO THE NOVELTY EXOTIC 
ANIMALS WERE FORCED TO PERFORM 
STUNTS 
THERE WERE ELEPHANTS YOUR STUNTS SRI LANKANS THERE WAS AN IRISH 
VILLAGE PEOPLE COMMENTED THE IRISH 
LOOKED CLEANER THAN THEY'D EXPECTED 
AND SENEGAL LEASE WERE CLEANER THAN 
THEY LOOKED 
AND THEY ALL HAD 
TO GO TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY 
APPARENTLY SO 
COMMERCIALLY THOUGH THE EXHIBITION 
WAS A SUCCESS IT WAS A PERSONAL 
TRIECH FOR THE MAN WHO MASTERMINDED 
THE WHOLE THING A SHOWMAN NAGAR 
KIRTAN WE TRAPPED DOWN HIS GREAT 
GRANDCHILDREN THE FULL STORY ABOUT 
THEIR ANCESTOR AND BACKGROUND HAD 
BEEN HUSHED UP IN THEIR FAMILY FOR 
YEARS YEARS EVEN OUR OWN MOTHER DIDN'T KNOW 
VERY LITTLE 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER 
THEY KNEW HE WAS JEWISH AND WITH 
THE SECOND WORLD WAR THAT WAS 
SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T BOAST ABOUT 
WHETHER IT WAS THAT OR BECAUSE HIS 
LIFE AS A SINGER AND DANCER WAS 
NOT SOMETHING YOU WERE PROUD OF 
WHEN YOU REACHED EMINENCE IN 
BRITISH SOCIETY I DON'T KNOW 
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THIS ACTUAL 
OUTFIT 
NOT THE SHOES THE THE OUTFIT THE THE QUESTION I ASK MYSELF IS HOW DOES 
THIS EXTRAORDINARY MAN WHO WAS 
HUNGARIAN JEWISH IMMIGRANT AND HOW 
DOES HE MAKE HIS NAME IN BRITISH 
SOCIETY AS HE DID THE LIST OF HIS 
CONTACTS EFFECTIVELY IS PEERAGE 
HE MUST HAVE HAD HUGE CHARM AND 
UNBOUNDED ENJIFPLT 
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE NINETEEN OH EIGHT 
OLYMPICS HERE YOU ARE IN NINETEEN OH SIX YOU 
HAVE TO PUT ON AN OLYMPIC GAMES 
AND THEY SIXLY WENT TO MY GREAT 
GRANDFATHER 
TODAY NOTHING IS LEFT GRANDFATHER OF THE STADIUM AND ONCE SPECTACULAR 
BUILDINGS BESIDE T. THEY WERE NEVER 
BUILT TO LAST THE BRILLIANT WHITE 
TURNED TO DIRTY GREY AND MOULDINGS 
CRUMBLED BY NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT MOST OF THE SITE 
WAS SOLD TO THE COUNCIL FOR HOUSING 
IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT THE B. B. C. BOUGHT ANOTHER 
CHUNK AND THE LAST BUILDINGS WERE 
TORN DOWN I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHY 
THIS PARTICULAR BIT OF LONDON IS 
EXTRAORDINARILY DESOLATE AND NOW 
I THINK I GET IT IT IS AS IF 
LANDSCAPES HAVE MEMORIES AND THIS 
ONE IS PERMANENTLY REMINDING US OF 
WHAT WE'VE LOST ONE THING DOES 
REMAIN THE STREET NAMES
