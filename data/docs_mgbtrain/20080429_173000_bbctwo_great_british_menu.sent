NOEL MCMEEL AND DANNY MILLAR ARE BOTH DETERMINED TO REPRESENT NORTHERN IRELAND IN THE FINALS 
THEY'RE ALSO BOTH TOP CHEFS 
BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM CAN SURVIVE THIS WEEK SO THEY'RE COOKING UNDER PRESSURE 
I ENJOY THE COMPETITIVE EDGE OF IT 
AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE BOTH HERE FOR 
EITHER YOU'RE IN TO COMPETE OR YOU'RE NOT 
IF YOU'RE NOT STAY AT HOME 
I WANT TO GO AFTER IT AGAIN AND HOPEFULLY SECOND TIME LUCKY YOU KNOW 
BOTH CHEFS ARE BUILDING A FOUR COURSE MENU SHOWCASING THEIR TAKE ON MODERN BRITISH COOKING 
ON FRIDAY THEY'LL PRESENT ALL THEIR DISHES TO OUR JUDGES AND THEY'LL DECIDE WHO GOES ONTO 
THE FINALS AND THE CHANCE OF COOKING FOR HESTON'S BANQUET AT THE GHERKIN 
THE COMPETITION KICKED OFF YESTERDAY WITH THE TWO CHEFS PRESENTING VERY DIFFERENT STARTERS 
NOEL THREW DOWN THE GAUNTLET WITH 
DANNY TOOK UP THE CHALLENGE WITH 
TODAY THEY'RE MOVING ONTO THE FISH COURSE AND A WHOLE NEW CHALLENGE 
MORNING MORNING HOW ARE YOU MORNING 
THAT'S A NICE BIG NOEL ISN'T IT IT'S A LOVELY BIT OF FISH 
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL BIT OF FISH YOU KNOW 
I SEEM TO GET A LOT MORE INGREDIENTS THAN YOU HAVE 
YOU'VE GOT MORE GOING ON YOUR DISH 
WELL I HAVE AND I HAVEN'T YOU'RE GONNA SEE THAT 
NOEL'S MAKING 
THAT BIT SOUNDS MODERN 
AS WITH HIS STARTER HE'S DEMONSTRATING HIS TECHNICAL SKILLS 
WITH A FAIRLY COMPLICATED DISH 
I UNDERSTAND THE HAKE AND THE MUSSELS CLASSIC NORTHERN IRISH INGREDIENTS 
YES SO WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO GET SOME PERNOD CORIANDER YOU'VE DEFINITELY GONE GLOBAL ON THIS ONE 
THIS DISH IS ALL ABOUT INFUSING DIFFERENT FLAVOURS YEAH BRINGING THE FLAVOURS OUT 
THIS IS VERY MUCH A MODERN INTERPRETATION OF WHAT MAYBE THE JUDGES ARE LOOKING FOR 
WELL WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT THE JUDGES THINK ON FRIDAY 
WHAT'S HIS RIVAL COME UP WITH 
I SEE YOU'VE APPLES HORSERADISH WHAT IS IT 
IT'S NOT VERY BIG WHATEVER IT IS FROM YOUR HOMETOWN 
SOME LOVELY LOUGH NEAGH SMOKED EEL 
NOW I'M HOPING THIS IS MY DISH THAT HAS THE MOST CHANCE OF WINNING 
OUT OF THEM ALL I THINK THIS WILL HOPEFULLY BE THE STAR OF THE SHOW 
NOW DANNY KNOWS THAT NOEL LIKES SMOKED EEL 
AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY RECKONS THAT THIS IS HIS STAR DISH 
HE'S SERVING 
HE CLEARLY THINKS HE'S PUT ONE OVER ON NOEL 
BUT WE'LL SEE IF HE'S STILL SMILING ON FRIDAY 
DANNY IS WELL GROUNDED IN MODERN NORTHERN IRISH COOKERY 
HAVING TRAINED WITH TOP CHEFS LIKE ROBBIE MILLER AND PAUL RANKIN 
WHEN HE DOES GET AWAY FROM THE KITCHEN 
HE LIKES TO GET OUT AND ABOUT WITH HIS NINE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER JESSICA 
BUT HE DOESN'T GET MUCH FREE TIME 
FOR THE LAST YEAR DANNY'S BEEN HEAD CHEF AT HIS OWN RESTAURANT 
BALLOO HOUSE IN KILLINCHY 
THE KIND OF FOOD HE PUTS ON THE MENU HERE 
AS IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN IS NOTHING LIKE HIS RIVAL'S 
HIS STYLE IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT MINE IS 
HE'S A VERY VERY GOOD COOK AND MORE THAN ABLE 
BUT HIS FOOD I THINK MIGHT BE A WEE BIT OVERWORKED 
I THINK SIMPLE AND I REALLY DON'T LIKE OVERWORKED FOOD 
DANNY THINKS THAT WHAT HE CALLS FIDDLING ABOUT WITH INGREDIENTS 
TENDS TO INTERFERE WITH THE FLAVOUR AND THAT TO HIM IS A CARDINAL SIN 
WHEN I'M WRITING A MENU 
I USUALLY TURN TO THE KEY INGREDIENT AND BUILD THE DISH AROUND THAT 
IT JUST TAKES WELL SIMPLE COOKING 
BUT THE SKILL IS NEEDED TO MAKE IT SIMPLE WITHOUT IT LOOKING SIMPLE 
SO LESS IS MORE 
LOCALLY PRODUCED FRESH INGREDIENTS COOKED TO EXTRACT MAXIMUM FLAVOUR 
I STILL GET SATISFACTION OF SEEING THE DELIGHT IN PEOPLE'S FACES WHEN THEY EAT MY FOOD 
I'M NOT JUST FEEDING PEOPLE 
I WANT TO GIVE THEM AN EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THEY MAY NOT HAVE TRIED BEFORE 
EXPANDING THEIR MIND AND THOUGHTS ON WHAT FOOD ACTUALLY IS 
SEA BASS AND LAMB 
IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TAKE TO NOEL'S ON WHAT MODERN IRISH COOKERY REALLY IS 
AND DANNY'S HAPPY TO TAKE HIM ON 
IT'S A COMPETITION LOOKING FOR A WIN 
THERE'S NO IN BETWEEN MAN HERE THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE WINNER 
HE'S OUT TO WIN IT AND I'M HOPING IT'LL BE ME 
IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT GOES ALONG THE REST OF THE WEEK 
BACK IN OUR KITCHEN DANNY'S INTERROGATING HIS RIVAL 
SO NOEL WHAT GOT YOU INTO COOKING 
WHAT WAS IT THAT GAVE YOU THE PASSION 
I THINK I WAS ONE OF THE FORTUNATE ONES GROWING UP ON A FARM 
WAKING UP IN THE MORNINGS HAVING TO RUN DOWNSTAIRS BECAUSE OF THE SCENT 
THAT HAD PERFUMED RIGHT THROUGH THE HOUSE BREAD COMING OUT OF THE OVEN 
THE FULL BENCH FULL OF COOLING RACKS OF CAKES AND BUNS AND SODA BREAD 
AND EVERYBODY ATE VERY WELL 
ALL OF THAT IT WAS QUITE INCREDIBLE 
GROWING UP IN THE COUNTRYSIDE WITH THOSE AROMAS OF A FARMHOUSE KITCHEN 
MADE CHOOSING A CAREER EASY FOR NOEL 
NATURE TAUGHT ME A LOT REGARDING WHAT TO EAT WHEN IN SEASON 
I THINK AS IT PROGRESSED THE INTEREST GOT DEEPER AND DEEPER 
MY REAL LOVE WAS COOKING 
HE'S LEARNED A WEALTH OF TECHNICAL SKILLS SINCE THEN 
BUT HIS BASIC PHILOSOPHY HASN'T CHANGED 
I'M A FIRM BELIEVER FOR ME ANYWAY 
THAT THE WHOLE THING ABOUT FOOD IS YOU COOK IT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE 
YOU GET THE BEST INGREDIENT 
COOK IT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AND SERVE IT TO THE GUEST 
WITH THE BEST SKILL POSSIBLE BY THE CHEF 
THAT'S THE SECRET INGREDIENT 
HAVING WORKED AT THE RENOWNED CASTLE LESLIE HOTEL FOR OVER SEVEN YEARS 
NOEL HAS RECENTLY TAKEN ON THE FRESH CHALLENGE OF BEING HEAD CHEF 
AT THE MAGNIFICENT LOUGH ERNE GOLF RESORT IN ENNISKILLEN 
HIS FOOD DOESN'T COME CHEAP BUT IT ISN'T THE MONEY THAT DRIVES HIM 
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTO THE KITCHEN 
BECAUSE OF THE PASSION THAT I HAD BECAUSE OF THE LOVE I HAD 
AND MOST OF ALL TO SHOW OFF THAT TALENT TO THE CUSTOMER 
AND SHOWING IT OFF WELL ENTAILS IMAGINATIVE PRESENTATION 
BUT TRUE CONTEMPORARY COOKING IS ABOUT MORE THAN APPEARANCES 
WHAT PEOPLE PERCEIVE AS MODERN MAY NOT JUST LOOK MODERN ON THE PLATE 
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE METHODS OF HOW THEY COULD GO THROUGH IT 
HOW THEY PUT THINGS TOGETHER AND SERVE WITH GREAT SKILL AND PASSION 
AND SHOWING A BIT OF YOUR SKILL ON THE PLATE AT THE SAME TIME 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN DANNY IS MAKING CRISPS 
FROM APPLES AND BEETROOT DIPPING THEM IN SYRUP BEFORE HE COOKS THEM 
NOEL SAW HIM STRUGGLE TO GET TO GRIPS WITH THE NEW KITCHEN YESTERDAY 
BUT THAT ISN'T THE ONLY PRESSURE HE'S UNDER 
ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT THE COMPETITION 
A LITTLE BIT YESTERDAY YOU KNOW FIRST DAY NERVES 
IT SHOWED I THINK IN PLATING UP 
BUT THIS TODAY HOPEFULLY WILL BE A BIT MORE SHARPER 
I'M STARTING TO FIND WHERE EVERYTHING IS 
THAT'S ALWAYS THE WAY ON THE FIRST DAY 
VERY MUCH SO VERY MUCH SO 
DANNY ALSO LEARNED YESTERDAY 
THAT NOEL LIKES TO KEEP HIS OWN DISH UNDER A SHROUD OF MYSTERY 
SO NOEL TAKE US THROUGH THIS FUSION 
WERE YOU GOING TO SAY IT'S CONFUSION 
NO NO IT'S NOT CONFUSION I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ALL THE FLAVOURS OUT OF THE VEGETABLES YES 
YOU'VE GOT RAW INGREDIENTS TAKING ALL THE JUICES OUT OF IT 
AND JUST SERVING IT VERY PLAINLY AND SIMPLY 
MAKING A JELLY FOR IT 
NOTHING LIKE A JELLY I'M NOT ADDING AN ANIMAL PRODUCT INTO IT 
THAT LITTLE DIG'S BECAUSE DANNY'S DISH DOES INCLUDE A JELLY 
THE VEGETABLE INFUSION HE'S MAKING IS SIMILAR TO WHAT I'M DOING MYSELF 
WITH THE BEETROOT AND APPLE IT'S PURE VEGETABLE JUICE 
IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO TASTE IT BUT I'M SURE IT WILL BE GOOD 
COS IT'S HAKE MUSSELS A LITTLE VEGETABLE BROTH 
A FUSION INFUSION CONFUSED 
I DON'T THINK DANNY'S CONFUSED AT ALL AND NEITHER DOES NOEL 
FAR FROM IT HE'S GOT HIS EYES SET FIRMLY ON THE PRIZE 
OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT GOING TO THE GHERKIN 
OF COURSE YOU HAVE TELL THE TRUTH 
THERE'S MORE OF A BUZZ FOR ME PERSONALLY 
TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT THERE AT THE END OF WHAT HOPEFULLY I'M GONNA PREPARE FOR THEM 
SO YOU ARE SURE OF THAT 
I'M NOT SURE BUT I'M HOPING 
SO IF YOU GET THROUGH DOES THAT MEAN THAT I'LL BE YOUR COMMIS 
NO NO I WOULDN'T SAY COMMIS 
YOU COULD BE K. P. 
YOU'RE TOO KIND 
NOEL AS A KITCHEN PORTER 
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF COOKING TO BE DONE BETWEEN NOW AND THE GHERKIN WHOEVER WINS 
DANNY PREPARES FRESH HORSERADISH TO MIX WITH HIS CREME FRAICHE 
AND HE'S STILL WORKING OUT NOEL'S TAKE ON THE COMPETITION 
WOULD YOU HAVE PREFERRED TO HAVE BEEN THROUGH LAST YEAR 
OR ARE YOU MORE INTERESTED IN COOKING FOR HESTON 
THE EVENT LAST YEAR SEEMED TO BE QUITE AMAZING 
I HAVE TO SAY IT REALLY DID 
BUT I THINK FOR A CHEF TO COOK FOR OTHER CULINARY KINGS 
IT'S SO MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL 
NOT TAKING AWAY FROM THE EVENT BECAUSE IT WAS MASSIVE 
AND TO DO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MIND BLOWING 
BUT THIS EVENT SEEMS TO BE REALLY UP THERE 
REALLY REALLY UP THERE 
IT'S SERIOUS I AGREE 
IT CERTAINLY IS 
NEVER MIND MICHELIN STARS THE CHEFS WHO DO COOK AT THE BANQUET 
WILL KNOW THEY'VE REACHED THE TOP OF THE TREE 
NOEL'S PREPARING HIS MUSSELS 
BEFORE STEAMING THEM WITH SHALLOTS AND A DASH OF WINE 
THIS WILL FORM THE BASE OF THE INFUSION FOR HIS HAKE 
HE'S BUSY BUT STILL KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON HIS RIVAL 
SO THE APPLES DID I SEE A STICKER ON IT FROM SOMEWHERE 
I'M NOT TOO SURE BUT MORE THAN LIKELY THEY CAME FROM SOUTH AFRICA 
YOU KNOW SO 
BUT AGAIN GRANNY SMITH APPLES ARE TO ME THE BEST APPLE IN THE WORLD 
THEY CERTAINLY DO HAVE A UNIQUE TASTE AND TEXTURE 
DO YOU THINK THE JUDGES MIGHT SAY SOMETHING BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN SEASON 
IT'S NOT THE SAME BRINGING IN SMOKED EEL FROM SOUTH AFRICA 
YOU KNOW THE MAIN INGREDIENT IS FROM COUNTY ANTRIM 
DANNY KNOWS THAT THE JUDGES INSIST THE MAIN INGREDIENT IS BRITISH 
BUT EXTRA INGREDIENTS FROM OVERSEAS ARE ALLOWED 
TO REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF COOKING IN BRITAIN TODAY 
WOULD YOU CALL YOURSELF A PURIST 
A PURIST NO DEFINITELY NOT 
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS LOCAL AND TO BE HONEST 
LOCAL WHERE POSSIBLE THAT IS 
AND WHEN IT CAME TO THE BEETROOT DANNY DIDN'T HAVE TO GO FAR AT ALL 
THERE ARE ACRES OF BEETROOT IN COUNTY DOWN 
SO DANNY HEADED FOR CHERRY VALLEY FARM NEAR COMBER 
TO MEET JOHN HAMILTON IN A VERY MUDDY FARMYARD 
GOOD DAY FOR IT 
HE WAS AFTER SWEET BEETROOT TO MAKE A J. ELLY 
HE ALSO WANTED THE RIGHT SIZE TO MAKE INTO BEETROOT CRISPS 
THE SMALL BEETROOTS WOULD HAVE ALL THE MINERALS AND GOODNESS 
CONTAINED IN A SMALLER BEETROOT 
THESE WEE BABIES HAVE A LOVELY SWEETNESS AND THEY'LL JUICE NICE WON'T THEY 
MAKE GREAT JELLY MAKE LOVELY JELLIES AND IF YOU WANT TO COOK 
BEETROOT CRISPS CRISPS 
BUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY OF MAKING A BEETROOT CRISP 
DANNY HEADED FIFTEEN MILES UP THE ROAD 
TO VISIT TAYTO CRISPS NEAR CRAIGAVON 
THEY OBVIOUSLY SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME MAKING POTATO CRISPS 
BUT THE BASIC PRINCIPLES SHOULD BE THE SAME 
THE KEY ISSUE FOR DANNY 
WAS WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER TO BAKE OR FRY A BEETROOT CRISP 
FRYING DEFINITELY WORKS BEST WITH POTATOES 
THAT'S A GOOD CRISP THERE IT REALLY IS 
BUT WOULD IT WORK FOR BEETROOT 
TAYTO'S BOB BROWN TOOK DANNY AND HIS FRESHLY GATHERED BEETS 
OFF TO THE KITCHEN 
HOW FRESH ARE THESE ONES 
THESE WERE PICKED THIS MORNING FROM OUT IN COMBER 
OH RIGHT OH YES NICE MARBLE EFFECT 
WE DO THE SAME WE TOP AND TAIL THEM THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
THE IMPORTANT THING FOR DANNY WAS HOW BEST TO RETAIN THE FLAVOUR OF HIS BEETROOT 
WHICH WAY DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE COOKING THESE BAKED FRIED 
WE WOULD FRY THEM DEPENDING ON THE BEETROOT 
AT A TEMPERATURE OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE HUNDRED SIXTY 
SET ACCORDINGLY THEN YES 
WHILE THE OIL HEATED UP DANNY POPPED ANOTHER BATCH INTO THE OVEN 
I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T WANT TO CROWD THE FRYER PUT TOO MUCH IN THERE 
OURS WOULD BE AGITATED TO KEEP THEM SEPARATED 
I'LL TRY TO REPEAT THAT PROCESS I'M AGITATING THEM ARGH 
YOUS ANGRY BEETROOT OH YEAH 
A FEW MINUTES LATER BOTH BATCHES WERE READY 
AND THERE WAS A SURPRISE WITH THE FRIED ONES 
A LOT OF SHRINKAGE YES 
WHAT ABOUT THE BAKED ONES 
TRY ONE OF THEM 
THEY'RE GOOD 
THEY'RE VERY GOOD THAT'S GOOD BEETROOT VERY VERY GOOD 
THERE'S NO COMPARISON NO I THINK THIS IS A WINNER 
A CLEAR RESULT 
BAKING IS BEST FOR BEETROOT 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN 
DANNY'S DECIDED THAT BAKING WILL WORK BEST FOR HIS APPLE CRISPS TOO 
HE THINKS THEY'LL WORK BEAUTIFULLY WITH HIS SMOKED EEL 
NOEL'S COOKING THE MUSSELS TO GO WITH HIS HAKE 
DANNY THINKS THAT'S A TRADITIONAL IRISH COMBINATION 
WHICH GIVES RISE TO A QUESTION 
SO NOEL WHAT DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WHAT DO YOU THINK CHEFS 
HERE IN THE MAINLAND PERCEIVE NORTHERN IRISH FOOD TO BE LIKE 
PEOPLE SEE NORTHERN IRELAND AS IRISH FOOD 
OVERCOOKED AND SOMETHING LIKE 
SURE IT'S THE PADDYS THAT CAN COOK POTATOES 
YOU KNOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED 
WE OWE IT TO OUR OWN COUNTRY TO GET UP THERE AND SHOW THEM 
THAT WE CAN COOK YOU KNOW 
YEAH I AGREE TOTALLY VERY WELL PUT 
WELL NOEL'S OBVIOUSLY VERY PATRIOTIC 
AND HE'S TAKING THIS COMPETITION SERIOUSLY TOO 
I'M JUST MAKING SURE THAT I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING 
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WILL BE 
I MEAN TO SAY THE BEST MAN WILL GO THROUGH 
DANNY LOOKS A BIT TAKEN ABACK 
HIS RIVAL'S OBVIOUSLY IN A VERY DETERMINED MOOD 
BUT HE HAS HIS OWN DISH TO WORRY ABOUT 
CHECK MY CRISPS 
MM H. M. M. 
NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF COOKERY 
CAN SO MUCH CARE HAVE BEEN LAVISHED ON A FEW CRISPS 
BUT DANNY'S CONVINCED THAT THIS DISH IS HIS STAR TURN 
QUIETLY CONFIDENT 
I THINK IT'S A DISH THAT'LL CARRY THROUGH 
AND IT'LL BE RECOGNISED BY THE JUDGES AS A SKILLED DISH 
WHICH IT IS IT'S SIMPLE FOOD BUT IT'S EXEMPLARY I WOULD SAY 
I'M BIASED ABOUT MY OWN FOOD OBVIOUSLY 
BUT HOPEFULLY IT'S A WINNER 
TO ADD ANOTHER TASTE AND TEXTURE TO HIS SMOKED EEL ON CRISPS 
DANNY'S MAKING BEETROOT AND APPLE JELLIES 
HIS STERN FACED RIVAL IS TAKING A CLOSE INTEREST 
SO DANNY WHAT IS THIS 
IT'S JUST PURE BEETROOT PURE ORGANIC COMBER BEETROOT JUICE 
O. K. 
SO ALL TOGETHER IT'S THE JUICE OF THE APPLE AND THE BEETROOT 
YES THAT IS IT NOTHING ELSE NOTHING ELSE 
NO SEASONING NO LEMON JUICE NO SUGAR JUST PURE FLAVOUR 
EXACTLY PLAIN AND SIMPLE STRAIGHT FROM THE JUICE 
AND THEN YOU ADD GELATINE TO IT 
YES THAT'S IT AND THEN JUST SET IT NICELY 
IT WILL COVER THE EEL LIKE A LITTLE COATING OF JELLY 
IT'S A DAINTY LITTLE DISH IT WILL BE QUITE 
SOUNDS VERY 
VERY WHAT 
SMART 
IT'S A DANNY MILLAR ORIGINAL 
NOEL LOOKS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED 
HE BELIEVES IN HIS OWN DISH BUT CAN SEE THAT DANNY'S CREATION 
MAY GIVE HIM A REAL RUN FOR HIS MONEY 
STILL TO COME DANNY'S IN TROUBLE BUT IS NOEL SYMPATHETIC 
SO DANNY YOUR CRISPS TURNED OUT O. K. 
NO CRISPS WORKED OUT GRAND GONNA MAKE 'EM NOW 
THE RIVALS GET TO TASTE AND COMMENT ON WHAT THEY'RE UP AGAINST 
IT'S ALL ACTION IN THE KITCHEN NOW 
DANNY'S BEETROOT AND APPLE JELLIES ARE READY FOR THE FRIDGE 
THEY'LL BE LAYERED ONTO THE SMOKED EEL AND CRISPS 
AND TOPPED OFF WITH HORSERADISH CREME FRAICHE 
IT'S AN ORIGINAL FISH COURSE BUT IS IT WHAT THE JUDGES ARE LOOKING FOR 
ON A CONTEMPORARY NORTHERN IRISH MENU 
I WANTED TO CHOOSE SOMETHING NO ONE ELSE WOULD BE DOING 
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE IT TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL AND A DIFFERENT STYLE 
ACROSS THE KITCHEN NOEL'S TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FISH COURSE IS HAKE 
SERVED WITH BABY ASPARAGUS IN A MUSSEL AND WATERCRESS INFUSION 
I AM BRINGING A LOT OF INFLUENCES WITH THIS KIND OF SPICY INFUSION 
THAT TO ME AT THE END OF THE DAY IS MODERNISING 
WHAT WE HAVE AND HAVE HAD IN OUR COUNTRY FOR SO LONG 
NOEL'S AS CONVINCED AS DANNY THAT HIS IS A WINNING MODERN DISH 
NOEL WHY DID YOU CHOOSE HAKE 
I COULD HAVE PICKED SO MANY DIFFERENT FISH 
I PICKED HAKE BECAUSE IT IS AN IRISH FISH 
IT CERTAINLY ISN'T PRETTY 
NOEL RESEARCHED HIS FISH VERY CAREFULLY 
HAKE IS WIDELY AVAILABLE AROUND THE WEST AND NORTH WEST COAST OF THE U. K. 
IT IS ESPECIALLY ABUNDANT IN MANY OF IRELAND'S SEA INLETS 
NOEL CAME TO KILKEEL 
NORTHERN IRELAND'S LARGEST WHOLESALE FISH MARKET 
IT WAS SEVEN A M. WHEN HE MET AUCTIONEER RONNIE CASSIDY 
FIVE POINT SIX OH FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SIX SIX POINT ONE OH 
EVERY MORNING EXCEPT SUNDAY THE LOCAL FISHERMEN OFFLOAD THEIR CATCHES AT THE CRACK OF DAWN 
THE GUYS GO TO SEA FOR MAYBE ONE DAY TWO DAY 
OR THE LARGER VESSEL WOULD MAYBE OPERATE UP TO SIX AND SEVEN DAYS 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF VARIETIES TO CHOOSE FROM 
BUT NOEL KNOWS WHAT HE'S AFTER 
I'M LOOKING FOR HAKE FOR THE DISH RIGHT 
I WANT IT ABOUT NEARLY THAT KIND OF SIZE THERE 
THIS FISH COMES IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES 
WHAT WE WOULD CALL A PIN HAKE OR A CHAT HAKE NOEL 
AS YOU CAN SEE NICE AND FRESH THE GILL BEAUTIFUL 
NOEL KNOWS HOW HE'S PLANNING TO COOK IT 
BUT THERE'S NO HARM IN GETTING OTHER IDEAS 
A LOT OF THE LOCALS HERE WOULD JUST STEAM IT THE WAY IT IS 
JUST THE WAY IT IS 
JUST THE WAY IT IS 
FOR ME I WOULD HAVE TO REMOVE THE HEAD 
BECAUSE MY MISSUS DOESN'T LIKE TO SEE THE WEE EYES 
THAT IS PROBABLY TRUE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 
NOEL WILL BE USING FILLETS ANYWAY 
IT'S FANTASTIC TO KEEP THE BONE IN IT 
CERTAINLY FOR FLAVOUR AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING 
THE FILLET COMES OFF VERY EASILY 
BUT FOR ME IT'S A LOT TO DO WITH CERTAINLY THE FLAVOUR 
BUT PRESENTATION AS WELL SO IT HAS TO BE PERFECT 
BUT WILL IT BE PERFECT FOR THE GHERKIN 
BACK IN THE COMPETITION KITCHEN NOEL'S HAKE FILLETS 
FRESH FROM BILLINGSGATE THIS MORNING ARE READY TO BE PAN FRIED 
HIS BLENDED VEGETABLES MUST BE STRAINED FOR THE MUSSEL INFUSION 
WHILE IT'S ALL COMING TOGETHER ON NOEL'S SIDE OF THE KITCHEN 
DANNY SEEMS TO HAVE RUN INTO A PROBLEM 
SO DANNY YOUR CRISPS TURNED OUT O. K. 
PERFECT CRISPY 
GOOD BUT ARE THEY 
NO CRISPS WORKED OUT GRAND GONNA MAKE 'EM NOW 
DANNY'S MAKING LIGHT OF IT BUT HE DOES HAVE TO MAKE THE CRISPS SOMEHOW 
IT'S A NEW KITCHEN TO ME 
I PUT THE APPLES IN AND BEETROOT IN THE OVEN 
IT WAS GRAND AT THE START 
IT WAS ONE HUNDRED DEGREES AND THEN I TURNED ROUND AND IT WAS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
I DON'T THINK IT WAS NOEL WHO DID IT BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED 
SABOTAGE SURELY NOT 
DANNY KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON HIS RIVAL WHILE HE RAPIDLY PREPARES ANOTHER BATCH 
NOEL BLAMES THE EQUIPMENT 
GETTING TO KNOW THESE OVENS CAN BE VERY TRICKY 
JUST SEEING WHAT'S WHAT AND HOW IT COMES TOGETHER 
NOW IT IS GOING TO BE VERY TRICKY GETTING IT ALL PULLED TOGETHER WITHIN THE TIME 
DANNY KEPT NOEL WAITING FOR AGES YESTERDAY WHEN THEY WERE SERVING THE STARTERS 
NOW THE MUSSEL INFUSION IS STRAINED AND ALMOST READY FOR THE HAKE 
HE DOESN'T WANT THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPENING AGAIN 
EVERYTHING MUST GO OUT ON TIME 
I CAN'T BE HOLDING FRESH WATERCRESS IN A WARM LIQUID 
IF IT JUST SITS THERE IT WILL BE OVERCOOKED 
SO I HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL AT THIS POINT 
THAT MEANS HE WON'T DO THE CRITICAL PARTS OF HIS OWN DISH 
UNTIL DANNY'S DEFINITELY IN THE ENDGAME 
SO ARE YOU REALLY PLEASED WITH YOUR CRISPS NOW 
BETTER THAN THE FIRST ATTEMPT IT'S DECEPTIVE 
LIKE ANY KITCHEN IT JUST TAKES A WHILE TO FIND OUT HOW YOUR OVEN WILL TREAT YOU 
THAT WAS A BIT TERSE 
BUT DANNY'S STARTED PLATING UP NOW SO HE MUST BE READY 
I'M A BIG FAN OF LOUGH NEAGH EEL 
WHAT I'M HOPING TO HIGHLIGHT IS 
BRING INGREDIENTS THAT PROMOTE GOOD IRISH LOCAL PRODUCE 
IF THAT MAKES ME A PURIST THEN I WILL ACCEPT BEING A PURIST 
WELL THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH CARING PASSIONATELY ABOUT YOUR PRODUCE 
BOTH CHEFS ARE CONCENTRATING ON ATTRACTIVE PRESENTATION NOW 
NOEL HAS TO ADD THE PAN FRIED HAKE TO THE VEGETABLES AND MUSSEL INFUSION 
WHILE DANNY LAYERS HIS SMOKED EEL ON TO THE CRISPS AND BEETROOT AND APPLE AND JELLIES 
O. K. 
THEY LOOK LOVELY YES 
CERTAINLY IT'S DIFFERENT 
HE'S RIGHT THEY DO LOOK COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
BUT IT IS TIME FOR THE CHEFS TO SPLIT UP 
AND TASTE THE DISHES SEPARATELY STARTING WITH DANNY'S 
THE LOOK OF IT IS SO SO DIFFERENT IT'S NOT MY CUP OF TEA 
IT LOOKS LIKE A CANAPE TO ME 
FOUR NICE CANAPES 
SO IT'S NOT A PROPER FISH COURSE IN NOEL'S EYES 
I WONDER WHAT THE JUDGES WILL MAKE OF FISH FINGER FOOD FOR THE BANQUET 
EVEN DANNY IS NOT QUITE SURE 
THE ONLY CONCERN ABOUT IT WOULD BE IF THE JUDGES SIT THERE AND GO 
OH LOOK AT THIS WHERE DO I START 
BUT I WANT THEM TO LOOK AT IT AND GO WOW 
AND THE FOOD REALLY JUMPS OFF THE PLATE 
IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE JUMPING OFF NOEL'S IT IS NOT WHAT HE EXPECTED 
MOST SURPRISING IS JUST THAT THE BASE IS APPLE AND BEETROOT 
CERTAINLY DIFFERENT 
WELL I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S GOOD OR BAD 
BUT DANNY'S BEEN ADAMANT ALL ALONG THAT IT'S HIS PRIZED DISH AND IT'S ORIGINAL 
I DECIDED TO CHOOSE THIS PARTICULAR DISH BECAUSE IT WASN'T A CLASSICAL FISH COURSE 
IT WASN'T A PIECE OF FISH WITH VEGETABLES AND A SAUCE 
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAS A BIT MORE OF A WOW FACTOR ABOUT IT I FEEL 
NOEL IS NOT CONVINCED AND HE'S NOT SURE THE JUDGES WILL BE EITHER 
I THINK THEY MIGHT JUST SAY IT IS A CANAPE OR IT IS NOT THIS OR THAT 
I DON'T KNOW I JUST THINK ONCE THEY PUT THIS IN AND THEY TRY IT 
THEY'LL GET A SURPRISE THERE IS A SURPRISE IN ALL OF THIS 
WELL WE WILL SEE IF THEY'RE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED ON FRIDAY 
NOW IT IS DANNY'S TURN TO RETREAT TO THE PRIVACY OF THE PREP ROOM 
AND SAY WHAT HE THINKS OF NOEL'S FISH COURSE 
IT LOOKS NICE IT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE TO THE EYE 
A NICE PLATE 
AGAIN THERE'S A LOT IN IT 
AS THAT MEAN TOO MUCH OR OVER COMPLICATED 
I'M SURE NOEL WON'T AGREE 
A VERY SIMPLE DISH 
I CAN SEE THAT ALL IT REALLY IS IS JUST VEGETABLES 
APART FROM THE FISH OF COURSE 
SO WHAT DOES HIS RIVAL THINK OF THAT THE MAIN INGREDIENT 
I THINK NOEL CHOOSING HAKE AS HIS FISH WAS A BRILLIANT MOVE 
BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY PIECE OF FISH ON IT IT WOULD GO WELL 
I DON'T THINK IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN HAKE 
THAT MIGHT BE TRUE FROM A TASTE POINT OF VIEW 
BUT NOEL DID CHOOSE HAKE FOR A REASON 
BECAUSE OF THE HAKE BEING A TYPICAL IRISH FISH 
IT JUST BLENDS VERY WELL TOGETHER 
SO THE FLAVOURS WORK TOGETHER BUT IS IT CONTEMPORARY COOKING 
IT MIGHTN'T BE PERCEIVED TO BE MODERN 
THE FACT IT'S A PIECE OF FISH IN A VEGETABLE BROTH 
BUT NOEL THINKS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COOKED DIFFERENTLY IN THE PAST 
IT'S NOT OVER BOILED THAT'S WHAT YOU IMAGINE 
THIS IS WHAT MODERN INTERPRETATION OF FOOD IS THESE DAYS 
AND HE'S CONVINCED THAT HE'S MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE 
I OBVIOUSLY I SPENT A LOT OF TIME CREATING THIS DISH 
IT'LL BE A TOUGH CHOICE FOR THE JUDGES ON FRIDAY 
TOMORROW THE CHEFS WILL BE BACK TO COOK THEIR MAIN COURSES 
NOEL'S NOT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY 
ARE YOU SURE IT'S JUST STAR ANISE ON THE DUCK BREAST 
WHAT ELSE WOULD IT BE 
AND HE'D HAVE US THINK IT'S UNCOMPLICATED TOO 
IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE SIMPLE THESE DAYS IT'S QUITE COMPLEX
