JOB DONE 
THE STRAIN AND THE STRUGGLE OF FINDING THREE UNIQUE AND QUIRKY PROPERTIES 
IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT IT'S NOT BEEN DIFFICULT AT ALL IT HAS 
I WENT TO ONE ESTATE AGENT'S I FOUND THE IDEAL PROPERTY 
I DON'T NEED TO FIND ANY MORE IT'S THE WINNER 
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I FOUND INGLENOOK IS A THREE BEDROOM COTTAGE WITH MATURE GARDENS 
WHICH FEATURES A FORMER CHAPEL 
IT STILL WON'T BEAT THAT WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 
THEN DOMINIC AND I HAVE BEEN WHAT CAN WE SAY WILD IS THE WORD 
THEY WANTED QUIRKY THAT'S QUIRKIER THAN LIBERACE'S HANDBAG 
THIS IS NOT QUITE WHAT THEY WERE AFTER UNDERLINING QUITE 
THERE ISN'T ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE IN THE COUNTRY BUT YOU NEVER KNOW IF YOU DON'T TRY YOU WON'T BUY 
LET'S COMMENCE THE VIEWINGS AT PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
PROPERTY ONE IS MY CHOICE AND IS SET IN THE PRETTY VILLAGE OF WHILTON 
THIS HOUSE HAS BAGS OF CHARM AND IS A THREE BEDROOM CHARACTER COTTAGE 
LOVELY LISA AND MARVELLOUS MARTIN HERE WE ARE AT PROPERTY ONE WHICH IS MY CHOICE 
IT'S FULL OF CHARM CHARACTER IT'S QUIRKY 
IT'S LIKE A GILBERT AND SULLIVAN OPERA WHAT DO YOU THINK 
UM IT'S NOT QUITE WHAT I HAD IN MIND BUT IT IS QUIRKY 
IN A SORT OF QUIRKY KIND OF SENSE 
I'VE SPOTTED A FLAT ROOF THE GUTTERING IS ALL OUT OF SYNCH 
WE'VE JUST SPENT MONTHS GETTING THE WOODCHIP OFF OUR HALLWAY AND THE OUTSIDE RENDERING LOOKS LIKE THAT 
I'M NOT REALLY VERY IMPRESSED KRISTIAN YOU ARE SINKING FASTER THAN THE S. S. THISTLEGORM SORRY 
MARTIN WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S NOT IDEAL 
I CAN ONLY THINK THAT KRISTIAN'S SEEN SOMETHING INSIDE 
IT COULD BE WONDERFUL INSIDE IT COULD BE 
GIVE THE MAN A BREAK NO I'M ENJOYING THE PAIN I'M LOVING IT 
GO INSIDE AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK I'LL BE LAPPING IT UP OUT HERE 
OFF YOU GO I'M ENJOYING EVERY SECOND GO ON NOW 
O. K. GO ON GO ON 
LET'S CLEAR OFF 
LET'S SWING POP THE HEADPHONES ON AND LISTEN TO THE GOOD TIMES 
I'M NOT SWINGING WITH YOU THIS IS INTIMATE 
NICE FLOOR 
NICE WOOD BURNING STOVE AS WELL PROBABLY WHY IT'S CALLED INGLENOOK 
ALL SELF EXPLANATORY IT'S NICER ON THE INSIDE THAN FROM THE OUTSIDE 
THIS IS A GREAT PROPERTY I LIKE IT THEY WON'T 
LOOKS SLIGHTLY MODERN LOOKS LIKE SKIRTING BOARD ON THE CEILING 
IT'S NOT SOLID EITHER 
WE'RE BEING VERY CRITICAL NOW HANG ON A MINUTE 
THERE'S A BIT OF BUBBLING UP THERE I HOPE THEY DON'T MIND 
IT'S JUST IT DOESN'T FEEL COLD OR DAMP BUT BADLY FITTED JUST BADLY FITTED 
SHE MIGHT BE A BIT OF A DIVA 
OH WOW OH IT'S GOT A CELLAR COOL 
SHALL I LEAD THE WAY YES GO ON THEN O. K. WICKED 
FIND HER A CELLAR THE MAGIC IS HAPPENING BUILD A HOUSE ROUND IT 
WHAT WOULD THIS HAVE BEEN THEN A CELLAR 
DUH GOOD STORAGE SPACE IT'S NOT ANYTHING ELSE IS IT 
DOWN IN THIS BASEMENT THEY CAN MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS THEY WANT NOBODY WILL HEAR THEM 
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HER PUTTING A PIANO DOWN THERE HOW CAN YOU GET A PIANO DOWN A CELLAR 
THIS IS INTO THE KITCHEN WHICH IS 
YOU LEAD THE WAY COS THIS IS WHERE YOU WORK WHERE I DO THE COOKING 
HE DOES ALL THE COOKING SHE TELLS HIM TO LISTEN AND LEARN 
I WONDER IF THERE'S A TOILET IN HERE NICE DOOR 
NO GOLF CLUBS SLIGHTLY QUIRKY I LIKE THE EDGE OF THIS 
THE WORM HAS TURNED SHE LIKES IT 
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE I WAS TO RULE THE WORLD 
QUITE A NICE LITTLE SUN ROOM LET'S HAVE A TRY OUT ON A SEAT SHALL WE 
IT'S NOT OVERLOOKED FROM IN HERE IS IT NO NOT OVERLOOKED AT ALL 
I'M BEING CRUSHED TO DEATH BY HIM HAVING A LOVELY TIME 
NICE DEEP SILLS I LIKE THAT 
I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE PLASTIC WINDOWS 
THEY'RE NOT REALLY IN KEEPING NO THEY'RE NOT 
WITH A HOUSE AS OLD AS THIS ONE YOU'LL HAVE A MIX AND MATCH DECOR 
IT'S MIX AND MATCH ERAS FIFTIES ONE HUNDREDS AND THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED YEAR OLDS 
YES I'M PRETENDING YOU MADE SENSE 
THIS ISN'T THE MASTER BEDROOM NO THIS LOOKS LIKE BEDROOM TWO 
IT'S GOT SOME SORT OF ANGLE TO IT 
I DON'T THINK YOU DON'T THINK FULL STOP I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME 
THEY'RE WARMING TO IT LIKE A PAN ON A STOVE YOU'VE GONE DOWN LIKE THE TITANIC 
THIS MUST BE THE MASTER BEDROOM NICE FLOOR 
NICE BUILT IN WARDROBES OH OH 
I WON'T OPEN THAT IT'S A BIT FULL GOOD IDEA IT WON'T SHUT PROPERLY 
I THINK SHE LIKES IT YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN I MIGHT CONVINCE MYSELF 
IT'S NICE AND QUIET 
SSH NO ZIP 
OH TINY BATHROOM IT'S VERY NARROW ISN'T IT 
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING EVERY FAMILY WOULD WANT SQUEEZED INTO A TINY LITTLE SPACE 
SO BEDROOM THREE IS AN OFFICE 
WE NEED THREE BEDROOMS AT LEAST SO THAT WE CAN PUT OUR VISITORS UP 
I HAVE GIVEN THEM THREE BEDROOMS WHAT IS WRONG ANSWERS TO THESE PEOPLE ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO HELP 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT DOES FROM THE OUTSIDE ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T LOOK AT THE OUTSIDE WHILE YOU'RE IN IT 
WE NEED TO GET IN THERE FAST WHY 
THE SECOND PERSON WHO HAS TO GET OFF THIS HAMMOCK WILL STRUGGLE 
I'M RIGHT WITH YOU 
I'M WORRIED IT'S ABOUT A MILE'S WALK TO THE PUB I CAN WALK A MILE 
YOU CAN WALK A MILE NO PROBLEM 
REALLY WE DO A LOT OF WALKING IT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
COS THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION WHICH IS 
I WOULD SAY THE FIVE SECONDS WE WALKED FROM THERE TO HERE 
WOW VERY INTERESTING INTERESTING 
LET'S GO DOWN HERE COME ON 
I'D SAY PULL UP A CHAIR BUT IT'S A BIT LOW COME THIS SIDE OF THE BAR 
HERE WE'VE GOT THE MOST FANTASTIC GARDEN CURIOSITY I'VE EVER SEEN 
IT WAS ORIGINALLY A CHAPEL THEN IT WAS THE VILLAGE HALL 
NOW IT'S BECOME A RATHER GRAND GARDEN SHED GRAND INDEED 
SLASH NIGHTCLUB 
HERE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN NINETEEN SEVENTIES BAR TO DO WITH AS YOU LIKE 
I PICKED THIS HOUSE BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAVE YOU GOT A FANTASTICALLY QUIRKY UNUSUAL KOOKY PROPERTY 
THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS FANTASTIC PIECE OF PROPERTY WHICH YOU CAN USE TO ENTERTAIN IMPRESS 
LISA CAN BANG AWAY AT THE PIANO TO HER HEART'S CONTENT 
AND YOU CAN DROWN YOUR SORROWS SOMEWHERE ROUND ABOUT HERE 
OR HERE BECAUSE I THINK I MIGHT ASK LISA TO DO THE SERVING THEN SHE CAN PLAY THE PIANO 
COME WITH ME THIS IS A NICE GARDEN YEAH 
IT'S A BIT SMALL WE HAVE A COCKTAIL OF MATERIALS ALL CLASHING 
JUST IMAGINE THE BACK VIEW OF THIS HOUSE 
CHANGE THOSE ALUMINIUM UNITS AND PUT IN DIRECT FIX ALUMINIUM DOUBLE GLAZED UNITS 
BEAUTIFUL VERY HEAT EFFICIENT 
AND COVER ALL THE BRICKWORK PAINT IT THE COLOUR YOU LIKE IT 
THE WHOLE APPEARANCE WOULD BLEND IN RATHER THAN CLASH 
BUT IT STILL WOULDN'T BE AS GORGEOUS AS THAT STONE BIT OF A MISMATCH 
BIT LIKE WEARING A DINNER JACKET WITH BLUE JEANS ABSOLUTELY 
OH BECAUSE I THINK THAT BLACK AND YELLOW ARE SUCH A GOOD COMBINATION ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE BEING WASPISH 
WELCOME TO THE ONLY MOANERS IN THE VILLAGE CAN I NOT MAKE YOU HAPPY NOT WITH THIS PLACE 
WE HAVEN'T TOLD YOU THE PRICE YET WE SHOW YOU THREE HOUSES WE WANT YOU TO GUESS THEM 
YOU'VE GOT A FACE ON THAT'S SAYING I DON'T WANT TO PLAY 
YOU COULDN'T GIVE THIS HOUSE TO ME 
BUT I'M SURE IT'S GOT QUITE A HIGH PRICE 
YOUR BUDGET WAS THREE HUNDRED GRAND PUT A PRICE ON THIS ONE 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE 
I'LL GO TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED JUST COS I THINK IF ANYTHING IT'LL BE HIGHER 
FAIR ENOUGH I HAVE TO SAY THE INTELLIGENT ERUDITE BRIGHT LOVELY PERSON IS CLOSEST 
THAT'S MARTIN 
BECAUSE THE ACTUAL PRICE IS FIVE SHORT OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND 
TEN GRAND LOWER THAN YOUR BUDGET DON'T PULL THAT FACE 
I DON'T LIKE IT I'M SORRY WAIT TILL YOU SEE PROPERTY NUMBER TWO COME ON FANTASTIC 
YEAH WHAT CAN I SAY 
THE HALL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN IS A PERFECT PARTY PLACE FOR MARTIN AND LISA

SO HAVE THE WIRING CHECKED BY A PROPERLY CERTIFICATED ELECTRICIAN 
NOW JUST WAIT TILL YOU SEE MY CHOICE OF PROPERTY 
THIS BEAUTIFUL FORMER CANAL WORKER'S COTTAGE

IF YOU GET A BOAT LIKE THAT YOU HAVE MOORING RIGHTS TO KEEP IT OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY A YEAR 
GUESTS CAN STAY ON THE CANAL BOAT THAT GIVES A BIT OF DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND THEM 
IT ALSO GIVES YOU A PLACE TO SIT OUT AND ENJOY THE SUNSHINE AND HAVE A GLASS OF VINO IN THE EVENING 
IF YOU WANT TO BE REALLY SHREWD YOU CAN CHARTER IT OUT 
HIRE IT OUT TO HOLIDAYMAKERS AND EARN A COUPLE OF QUID ON THE SIDE 
EINSTEIN DARWIN LITTLEWOOD WHAT HAVE THEY GOT IN COMMON NO IDEA 
GENIUSY I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING DO YOU AGREE PROBABLY 
NOW GUESS THE PRICE THAT'S THE ONLY AREA WHERE I MIGHT FALL DOWN 
THIS IS THE ONLY PROBLEM I CAN SEE HERE COMES YOUR GIGGLY WIFE

A CESSPIT'S FULL OF POO IT'S COVERED IN DECKING IT'S THE NICEST CESSPIT YOU'VE EVER SEEN 
REALLY EVEN I'M GETTING EXCITED ABOUT IT YOU CAN LOOK OUT OF IT 
JUST FOCUS SHALL WE TAKE YOU STRAIGHT TO THE SOLICITOR'S 
MARTIN WHEN YOU LOOKED AT MY PROPERTY YOU WERE THE CLOSEST 
SO LISA YOU'VE SEEN THIS LOVELY COTTAGE OF DOMINIC'S 
GIVE US A PRICE I THINK IT WILL BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND 
I THINK CLOSE TO THAT BUT PROBABLY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YOU'VE LEVELLED THE SCORES UP IT'S OVER WHAT YOU BOTH SAID BUT IT'S WITHIN YOUR BUDGET IT'S THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL GIDDY WELL STILL EXCITED POSSIBLE 
DOMINIC HAS FOUND A HOUSE BY A CANAL IMAGINE WHAT THE WILD CARD'S GONNA BE LIKE LET'S GO 
IT'S ACTUALLY THAT WAY COME ON HOLD ON IT'S THIS WAY ISN'T IT YES 
DOMINIC'S CHOICE IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE CANAL WHICH COULD POSE A RISK TO THE SAFETY OF RUBEN 
BUT BRITISH WATERWAYS PUBLISHES A NUMBER OF PRACTICAL GUIDES 
ON HOW TO ENJOY THE WATER 
HOLD YOUR BREATH BECAUSE THIS PROPERTY IS REALLY OFF THE WALL 
WE COULD SAY IT'S GOT THREE BEDROOMS A TOP OF THE RANGE KITCHEN A SURPRISING LOUNGE 
BUT LET'S JUST SAY WOW WOW WOW 
MARTIN AND LISA I AM ALMOST LOST FOR WORDS OF EXCITEMENT 
ABOUT PROPERTY NUMBER THREE THE WILD CARD 
LET'S NOT UNDERPLAY THIS THIS IS VERY WILD WE'VE GOT A REALLY INTERESTING PROPOSITION FOR YOU

OH MY GOD WHAT'S GONNA BE BEHIND HERE 
DIGBY THIS COULD BE ENTERTAINING I'M PLACING BETS ON IT 
IT'S VERY WHITE AND I DON'T LIKE THE MIRRORED WINDOWS BECAUSE IT LOOKS SO GREY OUTSIDE 
YOU CAN WALK ROUND THERE NAKED IT GIVES YOU A BIT OF PRIVACY 
THERE'S ANOTHER ROOM THERE I'D LIKE TO SAY I'M LOVING IT BUT I'D BE LYING IT IS WILD 
WAIT TILL THEY SEE THE NEXT ROOM 
OH OH LISA YOU NEED TO SEE THIS OH LOVELY 
THE SOUNDS FROM THESE TWO ARE NOT CONVENTIONAL HOUSE HUNTING SOUNDS THEY'RE NOT SOUNDS FROM THE FIELDS 
A NICE CONTRAST BETWEEN CARPETS AS YOU GO OVER THE THRESHOLD 
WE GO FROM STRANGE RED PATTERN TO OH MY GOD 
THAT IS THIRTY YEAR OLD WILTON CARPET 
IT GOES ROUND THE CORNER AND WE'VE GOT THIS LOVELY CLADDING EFFECT ON THE CHIMNEY BREAST 
BOTH THE WOOD AND THE STONE REALLY WORK FOR ME 
HE'S EXCITED SHE HATES IT 
THIS IS THE FIRST HOUSE THAT YOU'VE BEEN REALLY BUZZING ABOUT 
I THINK YOU ACTUALLY DO QUITE LIKE THIS 
WE COULD CAUSE A MARITAL SPLIT 
LET'S SEE WHAT THE UPSTAIRS HOLDS OH MY WORD 
AND YELLOW 
THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THIS HOUSE THE WAY WE DID NO 
I LIKE YELLOW I DON'T LIKE YELLOW LIKE THAT 
A LOT OF THAT STUFF WOULD MAKE A FORTUNE ON THE INTERNET PEOPLE WOULD PAY A LOT OF MONEY 
A REASONABLE SIZE ROOM YEAH IT COMES ROUND THE CORNER 
THEY ARE GENEROUS DOUBLES DOMINIC 
THEY'RE ALMOST TRIPLES TRIPLES 
ANOTHER ROOM AGAIN A NICE SIZE ROOM IT'S NICE AS WELL COS IT'S NOT A SQUARE BOXROOM 
EXACTLY THE PENNY'S DROPPING DON'T JUDGE IT ON THE CARPET AND WALLPAPER JUDGE IT ON THE SIZE 
WHAT ARE THE VIEWS OUT AT THE BACK ACTUALLY THAT'S QUITE NICE 
THEY ARE NOW SEEING WHY WE CHOSE THIS PROPERTY THE HUGE KITCHEN DINING ROOM AND GIGANTIC LOUNGE 
THIS IS NICE THIS IS NICE 
WELL APPOINTED NEW MODERN ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME NO THE BATHROOM OH BEHAVE 
WHY WOULD YOU NEED HANDLES THERE I DON'T KNOW DOES IT OPEN

YOU SEEM LESS ENTHUSI OH MARTIN STAY BACK 
OH NO 
ARE YOU READY YEAH OH ORANGE 
WOW 
I'M LOATH TO SAY ORANGE I THINK TANGERINE 
OH 
I'M ON A ROLLER COASTER 
WHAT IS WRONG WITH EXPRESSIVE COLOURS NO ONE'S MENTIONED YOUR SHIRT LET'S GET IN THERE 
SO WHAT WERE THE DRAWBACKS 
ONE THING IN ALL THE ROOMS BECAUSE OF THIS MIRRORED GLASS THE LIGHT QUALITY IS REALLY STRANGE 
THEY ALL FEEL LIKE IT'S DUSK AND I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THAT 
THAT'S BECAUSE THE VENDOR DOESN'T LIKE CURTAINS SO HE'S DECIDED TO PUT SOLAR GLASS ON THE WINDOWS 
TO GET SOME PRIVACY AND IT IS VERY EFFECTIVE 
HOP OUTSIDE JUST TO PROVE TO YOU HOW GOOD THIS IS 
SO YOU'RE JOE BLOGGS SITTING OUT IN THE GARDEN AND IF I JUST CLOSE THIS FOR A SECOND 
I'LL LOOSEN MY BELT AND TAKE MY TROUSERS OFF KRISTIAN'S GONE 
I'M JUST SEEING HOW MUCH PRIVACY WE'VE GOT HERE I'VE GOT MY HOLY PANTS ON SUNDAY ONES 
I'LL JUST PERFORM A FEW I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING 
THE LIGHT'S SHINING BACK OUT BUT YOU CAN'T SEE FURNITURE 
I THINK I'LL DO A FEW LITTLE LIKE THAT 
A LITTLE SHADOW PERHAPS LET'S WAVE SOMETHING AROUND 
ANYTHING GOING ON LET'S JUST DOUBLE CHECK 
LITTLE SHADOWS PERHAPS NOTHING MUCH THAT'S FUNNY BECAUSE 
OH MY WORD IT DOES GIVE YOU A LOT OF PRIVACY 
H. M. M. YES PUT YOUR TROUSERS BACK ON I THINK I'VE PROVED MY POINT 
MARVELLOUS THAT WORKS 
NESSUN DORMA PUCCINI 
GOODNESS ME 
HOW ROMANTIC IS THIS EH IT'S ABSOLUTELY STUNNING DOMINIC 
YOU ME AND I THINK YOU'VE TRODDEN IN SOMETHING 
THAT'S KILLED THE MOMENT THAT'S TOTALLY KILLED IT 
SORRY I DIDN'T JUST PICK A RANDOM FIELD TO COME AND IMPRESS YOU 
THERE'S A THIRD OF AN ACRE HERE IT'S HUGE 
AT A SLIGHT ADDITIONAL COST YOU COULD HAVE THIS THIRD OF AN ACRE ON YOUR DOORSTEP 
ALL FOR YOU FOR RUBEN FOR MARTIN 
IT'S OVERGROWN BUT IT'S YOURS 
YOU'VE GOT TO GUESS HOW MUCH THE HOUSE IS BUT IF YOU WANT THIS LAND IT'S FIFTEEN GRAND ON TOP 
IMPRESSED NO BECAUSE YOU'VE STILL GOT THE TRAIN LINE ACROSS THERE 
AND YOU CAN HEAR THE CARS ON THE ROAD GOOD TRANSPORT LINKS 
WE ASKED FOR NICE QUIET COUNTRYSIDE IT'S PEACE AND QUIET YOU CAN'T HEAR KRISTIAN 
I KNOW BUT IT'S NOT QUIET ENOUGH O. K. 
NOW WE KNOW THE WILD CARD ISN'T LISA AND MARTIN'S CUP OF TEA 
BUT BUYERS SHOULD RESIST THE URGE TO JUDGE ON FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
TRY TO SEE BEYOND THE DECOR AND CONSIDER THINGS LIKE THE SPACE 
MARTIN YOU'VE GOT A VERY CONCERNED LOOK ON YOUR FACE 
HE'S ELATED BECAUSE I'VE SHOWN HIM EVERY ASPECT OF THIS PROPERTY 
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK I MIGHT BE HAVING WORDS WITH KRISTIAN LATER 
HOW MUCH ARE YOU GONNA PRICE THIS HOUSE AT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
YOU SHOCKED ME THERE MARTIN I DON'T HAVE TO GO AS HIGH AS LISA I'M SURE IT'S GONNA BE ABOVE HER 
CAN I JUST HAVE A PRICE PLEASE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY O. K. 
WELL DONE YOU BECAUSE YOU'VE WON IN TOTAL YOU'VE GOT TWO RIGHT 
LISA YOU DID APPALLINGLY 
THE PRICE OF THIS PROPERTY IS TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
IF YOU WANTED THE LAND ON TOP THAT TAKES IT TO TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY 
YOU CAN HAVE A HUGE RURAL ESTATE SHOULD YOU SO WISH 
WE NEED A DECISION THAT WON'T BE DIFFICULT I DON'T KNOW 
IT WAS NUMBER ONE WASN'T IT ONLY KIDDING WE DON'T WANT IT NOW CALM DOWN 
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT TAKE THIS LAPTOP 
IT'S GOT PICTURES OF ALL THREE OF THEM WE MIGHT LIKE THIS ONE 
EXACTLY EXACTLY I DON'T THINK SO 
A BIT OF SINGING AND DANCING AS YOU GO ENJOY YOURSELVES 
SHE'S STARK RAVING BONKERS ABSOLUTELY YEAH 
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY A TWO HORSE RACE YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO SURE 
HORSE THREE FELL AT THE FIRST HURDLE HERE'S A RECAP FOR YOU 
FIRST CHOICE WAS THE THREE BEDROOM THREE HUNDRED YEAR OLD PROPERTY 
IT'S GOT A CHARMING INGLENOOK FIREPLACE 
AND A FORMER CHAPEL 
AND IT'S WITHIN MARTIN AND LISA'S BUDGET AT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
BUT MY CHOICE PROPERTY TWO IS EVEN MORE TEMPTING 
IT'S A THREE BEDROOM FORMER CANAL WORKER'S COTTAGE 
SUPERBLY DONE UP

WHAT ABOUT THE WILD CARD IS THIS THE WILDEST CARD EVER 
IT'S WILD WONDERFUL AND DIFFERENT 
A TRIBUTE TO SEVENTIES STYLE WITH VIVID DECOR AND OPEN PLAN LIVING 
THAT INSULATING SOLAR GLASS IS FUNKY TOO IT'S WAY UNDER MARTIN AND LISA'S BUDGET AT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
MAKES YOU WANT TO REACH FOR THE FONDUE SET 
PROPERTY NUMBER ONE DOESN'T LOOK SO BAD IT'S STILL GOT THE SHUTTERS 
THAT'S THE DINING ROOM IT WAS NICE INSIDE IT WAS QUITE NICE 
IT DOESN'T COME WITH THE TABLE THE KITCHEN WAS SMALL 
PROPERTY TWO BEAUTIFUL EVERYTHING TASTEFUL LOVELY WORK SURFACES 
THAT WINDOW IN THE BEDROOM WAS STUNNING 
PROPERTY THREE THE WILD CARD WHICH WAS WILD 
I THINK I KNOW WHICH ONE YOU LIKE AND YOU KNOW WHICH ONE I LIKE 
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW WHICH ONE WE LIKE PROBABLY 
BECAUSE WHO PULLS THE STRINGS YEAH ME YOU DO IT ABSOLUTELY 
MARTIN AND LOOPY LISA IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME IT WAS GONNA BE THIS CHOICE 
I SAID EARLIER TO KRISTIAN IT WAS A TWO HORSE RACE BUT I ONLY SAID THAT TO STOP HIM SULKING 
IT WAS ALWAYS GONNA BE MY CANALSIDE COTTAGE 
IT HAS ALL THE PROPER QUIRKINESS THAT WE LIKE 
THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS THE BEAUTIFUL DOORS 
AND WE HAVE OUR OWN DUCKS WITH THIS PROPERTY 
BEFORE YOU GO IN THERE OUR PROPERTY SURVEYOR HAS GIVEN THIS BUILDING A THOROUGH GOING OVER 
IT'S NOT LEGALLY BINDING AND YOU SHOULD GET AN INDEPENDENT ONE DONE IF YOU DECIDE TO PURCHASE THIS 
HE FOUND A COUPLE OF LITTLE FAULTS 
THE DOWNSTAIRS LAVVY IS NEXT DOOR TO THE KITCHEN NOT IDEAL 
BUT IT IS A QUAINT LITTLE COTTAGE AND THAT HAPPENS QUITE A LOT 
YOU SHOULD HAVE AN EXTRACTOR FAN IN THE KITCHEN AND IN THE TOILET 
WE RECOMMEND YOU GET ONE PUT IN THE BATHROOM 
ON THE BACK WALL HE'S WORRIED ABOUT DAMP PENETRATION BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF THE GROUND IS QUITE HIGH 
MAKE A SMALL TRENCH BESIDE THE BACK WALL SCOOP THE SOIL OUT 
MAKING SURE NO SOIL IS TOUCHING THE WALL SO NO DAMP PENETRATION 
THE PLACE IS YOURS I WAS GONNA SAY GO CRAZY BUT IT WOULD IMPLY SOMETHING YOU WERE YET TO BECOME 
LET'S GO AND CATCH LUNCH IT'S SUNDAY YEAH HE MEANS THE DUCK 
EAR PLUGS READY AS THIS FAMILY IS DETERMINED TO MAKE A RACKET 
THEY WANTED SOMEWHERE QUIET 
SO THEY COULD MAKE A LOT OF NOISE I HOPE THE NEIGHBOURS UNDERSTAND 
LISA LOOKS LIKE SHE'S ENJOYING RUBEN'S PLAYING 
LOOK AT MARTIN HE'S THE BIGGEST KID OF ALL 
RUBEN'S TRYING TO IMPERSONATE YOU KRIS 
THAT'LL KEEP THE NEIGHBOURS HAPPY 
RIGHT A DISCO INFERNO THAT'S A MUCH MORE PLEASANT SOUND 
WHAT BETTER WAY TO MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME THAN DANCE AROUND THE LIVING ROOM WAY TO GO LISA 
SHE'S FROM A COSMIC WORLD
