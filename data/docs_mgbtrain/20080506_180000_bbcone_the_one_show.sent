I TELL YOU WHAT CHRISTINE I MISS 
THE EIGHTIES 
BIG RON STILL AT THE ALBION L. HAD 
HAIR LIKE NODY HOLDER DO YOU KNOW 
WHAT IT WAS MY DECADE L. WAS 
ATTRACTIVE TO WOMEN IN THE EIGHTIES 
TAILS BLEAKLY NOBODY FIRES UP THIS 
BABY BUT ME GO PRESENT 
MUSH MUSH HELLO WELCOME BACK FROM WITH 
CHRISTINE BLEAKLEY AND ADRIAN 
CHILES 
I DID LIKE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AND SO I CHILES SUSPECT DOES THE MAN BEHIND D. C. I. 
GENE HUNT PHILIP GLENISTER 
WHAT A 
MAN LOVELY TO HAVE YOU HERE ALSO 
ON THE SHOW IS HARDEEP SINGH KOHLI 
AND THE ONE SHOW DOCTOR SARAH 
JARVIS PUT YOUR TONGUE AWAY 
BACK IN D. C. I. HUNT'S EIGHTIES BRITAIN MRS. 
THATCHER WAS ALWAYS PROMISING A 
CRACKDOWN ON BENEFIT CHEATS BUT 
THEY'RE STILL DOING GOOD BUSINESS 
BUT NOW THOSE TRACKING DOWN THE 
FRAUDSTERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEW 
POWERS WE'VE BEEN UNDERCOVER WITH 
FRAUDSTERS' INVESTIGATIONS THE 
IT MAY LOOK LIKE A POLICE STING 
OPERATION BUT ACTUALLY THESE 
INVESTIGATORS ARE FROM THE LOCAL 
TOWN HALL 
FROM PRESTON COUNCIL HOUSING 
BENEFIT INVESTIGATIONS TEAM WE 
NEED TO GO THROUGH DETAIL WITH 
REGARDS TO YOUR CLAIM 
HERE IN 
LANCASHIRE THEY TAKE BENEFIT FRAUD 
SERIOUSLY AND ARE LEADING THE 
FIGHTBACK AGAINST THOSE CLAIMING 
MORE THAN THEY ARE DUE 
O. K. TEAM TODAY'S CASE WE'RE 
LOOKING AT A POTENTIAL UNDECLARED 
PARTNER LIVING AT THIS ADDRESS 
ANDREW TAYLOR HELPS RUN PRESTON 
COUNCIL'S FRAUD INVESTIGATION UNIT 
HOW SERIOUS A PROBLEM IS BENEFIT 
FRAUD 
IT'S A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM FRAUD IT'S COSTING TAX PAYERS AND THE 
COUNTRY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF 
POUNDS EVERY YEAR 
HUNDREDS OF 
MILLIONS 
YEAH IF SOMEONE IS MILLIONS CLAIMING BENEFIT FRAUDLY OVER A FEW 
YEARS THE AMOUNT SOON MOUNTS UP 
TODAY THE TEAM WILL BE WATCHING THE 
HOUSE OF MAN THEY BELIEVE HASN'T 
BEEN STRAIGHT WITH ALL THE FACTS ON 
HIS BENEFIT APPLICATION THEY 
SUSPECT HE'S FAILED TO DECLARE TO 
THE COUNCIL THAT HE LIVES WITH HIS 
FEMALE PARTNER 
WE'RE HOPING TO OBVIOUSLY SEE HER 
GO TO WORK IF IT'S A DAY WHEN 
SHE'S NOT WORKING WE MIGHT SEE HER 
TAKING THE KIDS TO SCHOOL 
SOMETHING TO SHOW NORMAL FAMILY 
LIFE MICHELLE ARE YOU O. K. TO DO 
THE DRIVING FINE 
JIM YOU'RE IN FINE CHARGE OF THE SURVEILLANCE LOG 
HOME SURVEILLANCE MIGHT SEEM OVER 
THE TOP BUT CLAIMANTS WHO FAIL TO 
DECLARE PARTNER LIVING WITH THEM 
ARE BREAKING THE LAW 
IT MAY BE AN EARLY START FOR JIM 
AND MICHELLE BUT TO PROVE THEIR 
CASE THEY WILL NEED TO SHOW 
EVIDENCE THAT THE WOMAN ACTUALLY 
LIVES AT THE ADDRESS 
O. K. IT'S EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
WE'RE IN POSITION 
THE SURVEILLANCE CAR IS OVER THERE 
WATCHING THE HOUSE WE'VE BEEN TOLD 
TO STAY HERE AND TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS 
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT LONG 
BEFORE SPOTTING A WOMAN LEAVING 
THEIR TARGET'S HOME WHO WOULD 
APPEAR TO BE HIS PARTNER 
INVESTIGATOR JIM FOLLOWS BEHIND TO 
CONFIRM THE WOMAN IS DROPPING OFF 
HER CHILDREN TO SCHOOL 
ANOTHER SIGN THEY MIGHT BE LIVING 
TOGETHER AS A COUPLE SOMETHING HE 
HASN'T DECLARED ON HIS BENEFIT 
APPLICATION APPLICATION TO HELP CATCH THE FRAUDSTERS THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS INTRODUCED NEW 
POWERS THESE ALLOW THE 
INVESTIGATORS TO LOOK AT 
INFORMATION HELD BY CREDIT 
REFERENCE AGENCIES TO HELP PINPOINT 
THE BENEFIT CHEATS 
SO JIM WHERE ARE WE GOING NOW 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO VISIT SOME 
SINGLE MUMS 
ONE OF THE WAYS 
INVESTIGATORS TACKLE FRAUD IS TO 
TARGET SINGLE PARENTS WHO FAIL TO 
DECLARE PARTNERS WHO LIVE WITH THEM 
THE NEW POWERS WILL ALLOW THE 
AUTHORITIES TO MORE EASILY SEE IF 
THEY'RE TAKING OUT LOANS AND BANK 
ACCOUNTS IN JOINT NAMES SO THEY'RE 
GETTING MONEY THEY'RE NOT DECLARING 
CLAIMING BENEFITS I WILL LEELY 
THAT'S WITH A WE SUSPECT YEAH JIM JIM AND MICHELLE ROUTINELY VISIT NEW 
MOTHERS IN RECEIPT OF BENEFITS WHO 
HAVEN'T DECLARED A PARTNER LIVING 
WITH THEM THEY WANT TO SEE IF 
THEY'RE RECEIVING THE RIGHT AMOUNT 
OF BENEFIT 
HI WE'RE FROM THE INVESTIGATIONS 
OFFICE AT PRESTON CITY COUNCIL DO 
YOU MIND IF WE COME IN 
DO YOU OWN THIS PROPERTY OR RENT 
IT 
BUT SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE THE IT BENEFIT RULES AREN'T CLEAR ENOUGH 
MAKING IT HARD FORCLAIMANTS TO 
NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM 
RAISE RAY THE 
CASE OF LIVING TOGETHER WITH A 
PARTNER IS COMPLETELY 
PARTICULARLY COMPLEX WE ALL HAVE A 
DIFFERENT VIEW ABOUT WHAT LIVING 
TOGETHER IS DOES IT MEAN SOMEBODY 
STAYS OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF 
NIGHTS A WEEK DO THEY SHARE MONEY 
YOUR PERCEPTION OF LIVING WITH 
SOMEBODY MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM 
THE AUTHORITY'S WHETHER YOU KNOW 
WHAT THEY'RE ASKING YOU AND WHAT 
THEY MEAN BY IT IS A VERY COMPLEX 
AND CONTROVERSIAL AREANEVERTHELESS 
PRESTON COUNCIL OPERATE A ZERO 
TOLERANCE POLICY TOWARDS BENEFIT 
FRAUD WHAT ACTION WOULD YOU TAKE 
IF SOMEBODY IS GUILTY OF FIDDLING 
THE BENEFIT TFRPBLGTS COULD BE 
ANYTHING FROM HAVING TO REPAY THE 
OVERPAYMENT 
SOMEBODY COULD END UP OVERPAYMENT WITH A CAUTION THERE COULD BE A 
BENEFIT OR ULTIMATELY SOMEBODY 
COULD BE PROSECUTED 
HOW SUCCESSFUL WAS TODAY'S 
OPERATION JIM 
VERY IT WAS VERY 
SUCCESSFUL WE WATCHED THE SUBJECT 
LEAVING THE PROPERTY WITH YOUNG 
CHILDREN TAKING THEM OFF FOR A 
SCHOOL RUN IT 
SHOWS A PATTERN IT IT SHOWS SHE STAYED OVERNIGHT IT'S 
NOT DEFINITIVE PROOF 
IT'S NOT 
DEFINITIVE PROOF TODAY WE COME 
BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN CALL IN THE 
CUSTOMER INTERVIEW THEM AND PUT 
THE ALLEGATION TO THEM AND SEE WHAT 
THEY HAVE TO SAY 
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO 
ARE FIDDLING THEIR BENEFITS THAT THAT PRESTON COUNCIL IS GOING TO SEEK 
YOU OUT AND FIND YOU YOU'RE GOING GOING TO GET THEM WE'LL TRY OUR BEST GOING 
HARDEEP WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS 
WE SAW WITH THE FURORE ABOUT THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. RATE ON INCOME 
TAX PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW 
THE POOR ARE BEING LOOKED AFTER IN 
SOCIETY IF PEOPLE ARE TAKING MONEY 
FRAUDULENTLY IT'S NEARLY BILLION 
POUNDS IT'S SO MUCH MONEY THAT 
COULD BE SPENT ON PEOPLE THAT 
GENUINELY NEED IT IT'S NOT IDEAL 
BUT WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO DO 
DON'T YOU THINK A LITTLE BIT LIKE 
THEY'RE SOFT TARGETS AND THERE ARE 
REAL BAD BOYS OUT THERE TAKING 
BILLIONS OF POUNDS IN SERIOUS FRAUD 
SOMEBODY WHO'S CLAIMING SLIGHTLY 
THE WRONG BENEFIT WELL SO WHAT 
IT COULD BE ONE ARGUMENT 
THEN WHY 
NOT DO EVERYONE AS GENE HUNT MIGHT 
SAY DO THE LOT 
SARAH YOUR G. P. SURGERY PRESUMABLY PRESUMABLY YOU'VE COME ACROSS A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WHO PLAYED THE SYSTEM AS IT WERE 
IT'S INTERESTING WE TEND TO HAVE 
TWO EXTREMES WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO 
SAY MY LEG IS HANGING OFF DO YOU 
THINK I COULD HAVE NOTE TO SAY I 
DON'T HAVE TO DO THE HEAVY LIFTING 
AT WORK THIS WEEK BECAUSE I'VE JUST 
LOST THE LEG AT THE OTHER END YOU 
GET PEOPLE OF COURSE WHEN I'M 
WORKING I TEND TO WORK THROUGH 
EVERYTHING SO I'LL COUGH ON 
PATIENCE AND HOLDING R. IT IN BUT 
YOU HAVE PATIENTS COMING IN WITH 
A SPWIT OF A SNIFFLE AND THEY SAY 
I'VE ONLY COME IN FOR A 
CERTIFICATE AND IT'S LIKE REALLY 
THEY DON'T GET IT 
THEY REALLY DON'T 
DO YOU GIVE THEM 
THE CERTIFICATE OR NOT 
NO IN FACT 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET A CERTIFICATE 
FOR ANYTHING UP TO A WEEK'S WORK L. 
SPEND A LOT OF TIME SOMETIMES 
EMPLOYERS GIVE THEIR EMPLOYEES A 
HARD TIME SAYING THEY HAVE TO GET A 
CERTIFICATE IF THEY ARE AVENUE OFF 
WORK FOR A DAY OR TWO WE GIVE THEM 
A NOTE WHICH REMINDS THEM THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T NEED IT SO WHY 
DO THEY THAT'S NOT A GOOD USE OF 
G. P. TIME 
YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS 
WITH DOCTOR SARAH DEFINITELY NOT 
D. C. I. GENE HUNT COMES BACK AS BENEFIT 
FRAUD INVESTIGATOR 
THAT WOULD BE A 
GOOD SHOW 
OVER EIGHT HOURS 
I THINK IT'S A TRICKY ONE REALLY 
WE ALL KNOW WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED 
WHAT IT'S LIKE DEALING WITH LOCAL 
COUNCILS IT'S NOT THE EASIEST 
THING IN THE WORLD BY ANY MEANS L. 
THINK A LOT OF THESE THINGS COULD 
BE BASED ON IGNORANCE AND FORM 
FILLING AND PEOPLE JUST GET YOU 
KNOW DOWN WITH ALL THE PAPERWORK 
IT'S A TRICKY ONE IT HAS TO BE 
DONE IT HAS TO SAVE MONEY BUT AT 
THE SAME TIME AS LONG AS THEY'RE 
CATCHING BILLIONAIRES WHO ARE 
TRYING TO EVADE TAX GET THEM AND 
ALL ALL SARAH IS HERE BECAUSE ALL THIS WEEK 
DOCTOR SARAH'S SURGERY OF UNUSUAL 
AILMENTS IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS MORE 
ONE SHOW VIEWERS WILL BRAVELY 
INEXPLICABLY ACTUALLY SHARE THEIR 
CURIOUS AND AT TIMES EMBARRASSING 
CONDITIONS WITH MILLIONS 
YESTERDAY WE SAW SANDRA FROM 
BIRMINGHAM STRUGGLING TO KEEP HIR 
WIND UNDER CONTROL 
WE DO WISH HER 
WELL WITH THAT TONIGHT A MUM AND 
SON FROM BROMLEY WANT US DO RATHER 
MORE THAN SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF 
THEIR PROBLEM 
THERE'S NOTHING AS SATISFYING 
COMPULSIVE OR PLEASUREABLY PAINFUL 
AS HAVING A GOOD SCRATCH EVEN THE 
SIGHT OF IT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL WELL 
A BIT ITCHY 
IT CAN BE THE SYMPTOM OF ANYTHING 
FROM AN ALLERGY TO SKIN 
CONDITION LIKE ECZEMA OR 
UNDERLYING DISEASE LIKE THYROID 
TROUBLE OR EVEN JUST A LACK OF 
IRON IRON THIS IS THE SIZE OF THE SURFACE 
AREA OF YOUR SKIN 
ENOUGH TO CARPET A GOOD BIT OF YOUR 
FRONT ROOM THE SKIN IS THE BIGGEST 
THE MOST SENSITIVE ORGAN IN YOUR 
BODY ONE SHOW VIEWER LINDA HOWARD 
AND HER SON GREG SUFFER FROM ONE OF 
THE MOST MYSTERIOUS IFPS OF THEM 
ALL IT'S UNTREATABLE AND IT MEANS 
THEY ITCH ALL OVER ALL OF THE TIME 
THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH TO SEE HOW 
MUCH DOES IT AFFECT YOUR LIFE I'M I'M ALWAYS ITCHING SEVEN OR EIGHT 
PLACES AT ONCE I'VE LEARNT TO 
CONTROL THAT IT AFFECTS MY 
RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE BECAUSE I 
CAN'T BE HELD 
YOU CAN'T CUDDLE 
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER 
EXACTLY L. JUST 
FIND IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT 
WHAT ABOUT AT WORK GREG 
IT'S VERY 
HARD TO CONCENTRATE WHEN YOU'RE 
ITCHING ALL THE TIME IF I'M TIRED 
IF I'M TOO HOT TOO COLD ILLICH 
SOMEBODY ONCE SAID WHAT'S THE 
MATTER WITH YOU HAVE YOU GOT 
FLEAS THAT HURT YOU THINK THAT 
YOU DO LOOK AWFUL DOING THIS HIS HIS COLLEAGUES CALL HIM INDIANA GENES 
PROFESSOR JOHN MCGRATH IS ONE OF 
THE WORLD'S TOP DERMATOLOGISTS HE 
HAS TRAVELLED THE GLOBE IN SEARCH 
OF A GENETIC SOLUTION TO SCRATCHING 
LIKE ALL HUNT IT'S GREAT 
CHALLENGE IT'S A BIT LIKE FINDING 
A NEEDLE IN HAYSTACK IN THE D. N. A. 
THERE ARE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND GENE ONE OF 
THEM WILL BE THE GENE FOR ITCHING 
IN JANUARY THIS YEAR HE FOUND THAT 
NEEDLE IN A REMOTE BRAZILIAN 
VILLAGE SIXTEEN RELATIONS SPANING FOUR 
GENERATIONS OF A SINGLE FAMILY EACH 
WITH JUST ONE HER HE HAD TERRY 
MISSPELLING HIDDEN DEEP INSIDE THE 
THREE BILLION LETTERS OF THEIR D. N. A. 
THIS IS THE GENETIC CODE AS I 
SCROLL DOWN THE SCREEN YOU CAN SEE 
THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS 
OF LETTERS THIS IS THE BRAND YOU 
ITCH GENE IN YOUR SKIN THERE'S 
JUST ONE LITTLE TYNE MISTAKE ONE 
LETTER OUT OF THIS GENE GOING WRONG 
THAT'S WHAT'S CAUSING THE ITCHING 
THAT'S JUST ONE GENE THAT'S IT 
THAT ONE LITTLE CHANGE CAUSES THE 
CHEMICALS IN YOUR SKIN TO REACT 
DIFFERENTLY SORBGS THEY SEND 
DIFFERENT SIGNALS DOWN YOUR BRAIN 
SO THEY SEND DIFFERENT SIGNALS DOWN 
YOUR BRAIN TO MAKE THEM ITCH DO DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FIND A CURE TO 
STOP US ITCHING 
I HOPE SO MAYBE 
NOT IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE WE NEED TO 
DO MORE EXPERIMENTS BUT WE AT 
LEAST KNOW WHICH EXPERIMENTS TO DO 
TO BE ITCH FREE WOULD BE JUST I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS WE DON'T 
KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO NOT BE ITCHY 
OUR WORK AND THE WORK FROM OTHERS 
HAS STARTED TO REVEAL FASCINATING 
NEW INSIGHT INTO WHAT CAUSES 
ITCHING INTO SOME PEOPLE WE'VE 
GONE FROM KNOWING NOTHING TO QUITE 
A LOT 
IT'S OUT OF THIS WORLD IT MUST BE 
LOVELY TO BE CALM ON YOUR BODY AND 
NOT FEEL THE ITCHING SO IF THEY 
CAN FIND A CURE THAT WOULD BE 
WONDERFUL WONDERFUL SARAH YOU REALLY FEEL FOR THEM 
HERE IS HARDEEP ALWAYS WILLING TO 
OFFER HIS SERVICES A ROLE IN HOLBY 
CITY FOR YOU PHIL 
I WAS TOLD IF 
YOU WEAR STETHSCOPES LIKE THIS 
YOU'RE COOL 
NOBODY EVER TOLD ME THAT WHEN I WAS 
WORKING WORKING YOU DID FEEL FOR THAT COUPLE BUT 
WHAT PARTS OF THE BODY ARE MORE 
PRONE TO ITCHING IT'S NOT ALWAYS 
GENETIC 
IT'S NOT USUALLY IT ISN'T GENETIC ONE OF THE THINGS YOU NEED TO BEAR 
IN MIND IS THAT ALTHOUGH IT'S 
INCREDIBLY RARE ABOUT AS RARE AS A 
HEADACHE BEING CAUSED BY MENINGITIS 
WE WOULD ALWAYS IF SOMEONE IS 
ITCHING ALL OVER WANT TO RULE OUT A 
THYROID PROBLEM KIDNEY OR LIVER 
IF YOU ITCH ALL OVER DO SEE A G. P. 
BUT COMMON ONES ECZEMA REALLY 
COMMON BACKS OF THE KNEES CAN BE A 
VERY COMMON SIGHT AND THE FRONTS OF 
THE ELBOWS BUT ALSO THE HANDS 
ESPECIALLY IN GROWN UPS 
INFLAMMATION CAUSED BY IRRITATION 
BECAUSE WE USE OUR HANDS SO MUCH 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM IT REALLY LOOKS 
PAINFUL THE SKIN CRACKS IT BLEEDS 
IT GETS SORE AND INFLAMED 
FRONTS OF THE KNEES AND THE BACKS 
OF THE ELBOWS MUCH MORE COMMON TO 
HAVE PSORIASIS PSORIASIS CAN CAUSE 
PROBLEMS ALL OVER YOUR BODY AND AND THAT'S UNSIGHTLY YOU FEEL FOR 
ANYONE HAVING TO DEAL WITH THAT 
ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN GET PSORIASIS 
ON YOUR NUCKLES AND SCABIES 
SCABIES IS OUR LITTLE FRIEND THE 
BURROUGHS IF YOU SEE G. P. LOOKING 
BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS AND THEN 
RUSHING OFF TO WASH YOUR HANDS YOU 
KNOW THEY'RE CONVINCED YOU HAVE 
SCABIES 
HOW DO YOU GET THAT IT'S SCABIES IT'S INCREDIBLY EASY TO SCRATCH KIDS 
CAN GET IT PEOPLE LIVING IN LONG 
TERM CLOSE ENVIRONMENTS AND YOU 
CAN CATCH IT FROM CLOSE CONTACT 
WITH OTHER PEOPLE IT CAUSES THESE 
LITTLE MITES UNDERNEATH YOUR SKIN 
YOU HAVE TO PUT STUFF ALL OVER TO 
GET RID OF IT 
IT CAUSES INTENSE INCH THE HOTTER 
YOU GET THE MORE ITCHY 
HARDEEP HAVE YOU EVER HAD SCABIES 
NO BUT WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT 
ITCHING YOU DO FEEL LIKE SCRATCHING 
IT CAN BE STRESS RELATED PSORIASIS PSORIASIS IS VERY OFTEN BROUGHT ON FOR THE 
FIRST TIME AND CERTAINLY MADE WORSE 
BY STRESS IT CAN BE BROUGHT ON BY 
A THROAT INFECTION THINGS LIKE 
THAT PARTLY IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE 
A TENDENCY IT DOES SOMETIMES RUN 
IN FAMILIES 
SO KEEPING THE SKIN MOISTUREISED 
HUGELY MOISTUREISED COOL AND A 
SCALP IS A SENSITIVE PLACE PHIL PHIL YOU LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO 
MOISTUREISES 
I DO MY A LUEGSS MOISTUREISES SOMETIMES TOOTHPASTE ON MY FACE 
ADAM ANT MADE A LIFESTYLE FOR IT 
HARDEEP HAS BEEN EXPOSING HIMSELF 
TO FAIR BIT OF IT ON THE WELSH 
COAST HE GAVE THE TASK OF FINDING 
THE REAL LITTLE BRITAIN AND IT 
KICKS OFF IN CONWY 
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO 
MAKING FILM HERE UNTIL THEY 
SHOWED ME MY ACCOMMODATION 
AT LEAST THE VIEW IS GOOD 
WELCOME TO BRITAIN'S SMALLEST HOUSE 
A ONE UP ONE DOWN SIX FOOT BY TEN 
FOOT HOUSE IT WOULD BE SQUEEZE 
IF YOU HAD A FEW FRIENDS 
YES UNLESS ONE WAS SARAH PARISH 
MARGARET'S MOTHER REMEMBERED THE 
LAST PERSON TO LIVE HERE 
HE WAS CALLED ROBERT JONES AND HE 
WAS SIX FOOT THREE HE USED TO 
SPEND MOST OF HIS LIFE OUT OF DOORS 
AND THEN I BELIEVE WHEN HE WASN'T 
FISHING HE WAS IN THE PUB ALTHOUGH ALTHOUGH THIS WAS THE SMALLEST HOUSE IN 
CONWAY IT WASN'T THAT UNUSUAL NO NO THERE WERE ROWS OF LITTLE HOUSES 
LIKE LITTLE MEWS ALL OVER THE PLACE 
REALLY 
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THREE REALLY THINGS ABOUT ROBERT JONES ONE HE 
LIVED IN THE SMALLEST HOUSE TWO 
HE WAS A FISH EBBMAN THREE HE 
SPENT ALL HIS TIME IN THE PUB 
WOULD ROBERT NOW RECOGNISE HIS HOME 
TOWN AND HOW MUCH HAS REALLY 
CHANGED IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS FIRST HIS 
HOUSE FOR ROBERT IT WAS SIMPLY A 
PLACE TO LAY HIS HEAD SO HOW MUCH 
WOULD ONE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT OF ONE UP ONE 
DOWN PRIME REAL ESTATE BE WORTH 
TODAY 
IF YOU WERE DOING IT BY TODAY SQUARE FOOTAGE YOU ARE GOING TO BE 
TALKING ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND 
WHAT WOULD IT 
BE WORTH AS IT IS GIVEN IT IS THE 
SMALLEST HOUSE IN BRITAIN COULD 
YOU VALUE IT 
FANTASTIC POSITION ON 
THE QUAY HISTORY I BET YOU COULD 
GET SOME AMERICAN TO BUY IT FOR A 
QUARTER OF A MILLION 
A SNIP AT 
DOUBLE THE PRICE DESPITE THE SOARS 
PRICES CONWAY'S 
PRICES 
PRICES CONWAY'S HOUSE PRICES THEMSELVES HAVE CHANGED VERY LITTLE 
PERHAPS ROBERT WAS WORKING KNIGHTS 
THEY MADE ME SAY THAT WE DO KNOW 
HE WAS A MUSTLE FISHERMAN AND IT IS 
A HUB OF THE SHELLFISH AGENCY 
LOSE THE OUT BOARD AND COATS AND 
TREVOR AND TOM JONES ARE STILL 
FISHING WITH EXACTLY THE SAME GEAR 
AS THEIR TINY HOME NAME SAKE 
MUSSELS ARE THE PERFECT MEAL TO 
COOK AT THE END OF THE A HARD DAY 
ROBERT JONES WOULDN'T BE HEADING TO 
THE SMALLEST HOUSE BUT TO THE 
PUBLIC HOUSE IT IS A RITUAL THAT 
TREVOR AND HIS EX COLLEAGUE KEN ARE 
HAPPY TO CONTINUE AS THEY RECALL 
STORIES OF THE TALLEST FISHERMAN IN 
CONWAY HOW MUCH TIME WERE YOU 
SPENDING OUT ON THE WATER IT IT DEPENDS ON WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME 
ON THE WATER 
HOW MUCH TIME IN THE 
PUB 
WELL HALF AN HOUR PUB A LOT HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST ONE HUNDRED 
YEARS BUT IF ROBERT JONES WAS 
ALIVE TODAY HE COULD STILL FISH ON 
THAT WATTER HE COULD GO FOR A PINT 
IN THE PUB AND AT THE END OF THE 
NIGHT HE COULD PUT HIS HEAD DOWN IN 
THE SMALLEST HOUSE IN BRITAIN 
UNLIKE ME I AM GOING BACK TO THE 
PUB PUB ENJOYED YOURSELF THERE YOU ARE 
CONTINUING WITH THE DRINKING THEME 
AS WELL 
I AM NEXT IN THE SERIES 
OF THE REAL LITTLE BRITAIN IS THE 
SMALLEST PUB WITH THE BIGGEST 
MEASURES MEASURES IT IS FULL MEASURES 
FULL MEASURES 
MORE REAL MEN WORKING AND 
DRENINGING HARD NOT UNLIKE D. C. I. 
GENE HUNT REALLY LET'S LOOK AT HIM RIGHT LET'S FIRE UP THE QUATTRO MY REPUTATION PROCEEDS ME 
WE'LL GO THE LONG WAY ROUND I'M 
NOT SCRATCHING THIS BABY 
CAN THERE BE A PART ANYWHERE IN 
FILM OR TELEVISION THAT'S MORE FUN 
TO PLAY THAN GENE HUNT 
NOT THAT I 
KNOW OF AT THE MOMENT NO IT'S 
GREAT FUN IT IS WHAT WE CALL A 
GIFT OF A PART THE WHEL TEAM OF 
WRITERS ARE AMAZING BUT MATTHEW 
GRAHAM AND ASHLEY FAIRER THE TWO 
LEAD WRITERS ON IT CREATED A GREAT 
CHARACTER 
I WAS THRILLED TO FIND CHARACTER OUT THAT THERE WAS A FOOTBALL 
BACKGROUND AN INSPIRATION FOR IT 
WHEN WE WERE DOING THE RESEARCH FOR 
LIVE ON MARS JOHN SIM DECIDED HIS 
RESEARCH HE WATCHED A LOT OF 
EPISODES OF THE SWEENEY AND I CAME 
ACROSS D. V. D. OF MATCH OF THE DAY FROM 
THE SIXTIES SEVENTIES AND EIGHT OS THAT WAS A 
GREAT CLIP IN IT OF BRIAN CLOUGH 
BEING ASKED A QUESTION BY WE WE HAVE THE CLIP HERE THIS INSPIRED 
YOU TO DO GENE HUNT IN A CERTAIN 
WAY WAY HOW DO YOU REACT WHEN SOMEONE FROM 
YOUR PLAYING STAFF AND SAYS I 
THINK YOU ARE DOING THIS WRONGLY 
I ASK HIM WHAT HE THINKS SHOULD BE 
DONE AND WE GET DOWN TO IT AND WE 
TALK ABOUT IT FOR TWENTY MINUTES AND 
THEN DECIDE I WAS RIGHT 
IT IS THE 
SMILE AT THE END THERE'S SOMETHING 
MORE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT GENE HUNT 
THAT COMES IN THE WRITING AND 
SCRIPT I DID THINK THAT WAS THE 
KEY TO GENE THE ATTITUDE THING 
THIS IS THE WAY I DO IT IF YOU 
DON'T LIKE IT TOUGH 
THE CRITICS 
A LITTLE SPIKY WITH ASHES TO 
ASHES WAS THE FACT YOU HAD TO 
FOLLOW BIG FOOT STEPS 
YES WE 
TRIED TO MAKE IT ITS OWN IDENTITY 
IT IS SUCH A BIG SHOW TO FOLLOW WE 
KNEW WE WOULD HAVE OUR DETRACTORS 
BECAUSE BRINGING IN A FEMALE A LOT 
OF PEOPLE FELT LIFE ON MARS WAS A 
BLOKE'S SHOW SUDDENLY A WOMAN 
APPEARS AND THEY GET A BIT 
THREATENED AND THINK HANG ON THIS 
IS OUR SHOW 
SHE'S MANAGED TO BRING 
THE PERM BACK 
SHE'S DONE A LOT OF 
DAMAGE WITH HAIR AND MAKE UP 
DEFINITELY 
WHAT WAS IT LIKE IN DEFINITELY BETWEEN LIVE ON MARS AND ASHES TO 
ASHES THAT YOU DID CRANFORD THE THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTIES 
YOU DIDN'T TURN INTO GENE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTIES HUNT THERE YOU ARE ABOARD A HORSE 
FIRE UP THE PONY 
DID YOU FORGET 
YOURSELF AND TURN INTO GENE HUNT 
NO THERE WAS FUNNY OCCASION WHEN 
WE WERE FILMING DAME JUDI DENCH WHO 
PLAYED MISS MATTY WHO I ONLY MET 
TWICE ON THE WHOLE GIG ONCE WHEN 
WE HAPPENED TO BE CROSSING OVER 
SCENES AND IT WAS LUNCH TIME AND I

ON THE FLOOR AND SHE WAS JUST 
DRIVING PAST ON THE BACK OF HUGE 
B. M. W. WITH TINTED BLACKED OUT WINDOW

DECADE OF ASHES TO ASHES

TO PUT A GREAT BIG NOTICE UP AND 
SAY WHAT WE HAVE DONE PEOPLE CAN
