GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO FOOTBALL 
FOCUS IT'S D. DAY IN THE RACE FOR 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE 
IT'S WIN OR BUST FOR CHELSEA AS 
THEY HOST LEAD ERS MANCHESTER 
UNITED WE'LL BE LIVE AT STAMFORD 
BRIDGE AND HEAR FROM THE FORMER 
SPECIAL ONE 
CHELSEA PLAYERS KNOW 
HOW TO BEAT THEM 
BUT THEY WILL 
VERY TO GET PAST KEEPER EDWIN VAN 
DER SAR WHO'S RATHER MODEST ABOUT 
HIS OWN CONTRIBUTION 
IT'S BEEN 
VERY IMPORTANT I'VE BEEN CRUCIAL 
FOCUS SPEAKS TO BARCELONA'S THIERRY 
HENRY ON DERAILING FERGIE'S 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE HOPES LIFE IN 
SPAIN AND A POSSIBLE RETURN TO THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE 
WHEN HOW IT'S A 
BOSS OR KITMAN 
CAN BOLTON ESCAPE 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE TRAP DOOR WE 
HEAR FROM CLUB CAPTAIN KEVIN NOLAN 
WE PREVIEW THE RELEGATION SIX 
POINTER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP AS IAN HOLLOWAY'S 
LEICESTER CITY TAKES ON BRIAN LAWS' 
SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY TENSE AND 
NERVY TIMES BUT WITH ME TWO COOL 
CUSTOMERS IN LEE DIXON AND MARK 
LAWRENSON NOT LONG NOW UNTIL THE 
POTENTIAL TITLE DECIDER AT STAMFORD 
BRIDGE AS CHELSEA TAKE ON LEADERS 
MANCHESTER UNITED AFTER A MONTH OF 
TWISTS AND TURNS UNITED CAN 
EFFECTIVELY CLINCH THE LEAGUE 
WHILE A BLUES' WIN WILL SET UP A 
THRILLING END TO THE SEASON EVEN 
THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN WRITTEN OFF BY 
SOME EXPERTS 
I DON'T GIVE ANY 
CHELSEA OF WINNING MANCHESTER MANCHESTER UNITED AND ARSENAL ARE TOO GOOD I I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF IT'S NOT 
MANCHESTER UNITED AND ARSENAL BUT BUT CHELSEA WEREN'T LISTENING AFTER 
ALL THEIR FINE WORK ARSENAL'S 
SEASON WAS UNRAFRLG THE BLUES 
REPLACED THEM IN THE TOP TWO IF IF YOU BEAT MANCHESTER UNITED IN THE 
AT STAMFORD BRIDGE IT COULD BE 
VERY INTERESTING 
MORE THAN 
INTERESTING 
EARLIER UNITED'S GRIP INTERESTING ON THE CHAMPIONSHIP HAD TIGHTENED 
LIVERPOOL'S WORLD TURNED UPSIDE 
DOWN VILLA SERVED UP NEXT 
MIND THE GAP BUT CHELSEA HANDLED 
THE PRESSURE AT MIDDLESBROUGH AND 
AT MANCHESTER CITY 
AND HE MIGHT HAVE 
WRAPPED IT UP FOR CHELSEA 
WE KNEW WE NEEDED TO PASS LIVERPOOL 
SINK FIVE POINTS AHEAD OF ARSENAL 
NOW THERE IS ONLY ONE 
CHELSEA WERE 
REFUSING TO GO QUIETLY UNITED 
APPEARED TO BE BUCKLING 
IT'S A POINT THAT 
GIVES CHELSEA A LITTLE MORE HOPE 
PERHAPS ARSENAL COULD DELIVER A 
LETHAL BLOW 
PENALTY SCORED 
IT'S HARGREAVES IT'S IN 
NO THE FOLLOWING NIGHT CHELSEA 
WERE PLAYING CATCH UP AT LEAST 
THEY HAD A HOME BANKER WITH WIGAN 
DIDN'T THEY 
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT 
CHELSEA HAVE DROPPED TWO 
CHAMPIONSHIP POINTS THERE 
CHELSEA HEADS IN A SPIN THREE DAYS 
ON PRETTY MUCH WIN OR BUST AT 
EVERTON BUT UNITED'S CRUISE TO THE 
TITLE HIT FURTHER TROUBLE THEIR 
BOAT ROCKED AT BLACKBURN 
THEY ARE OUT OF JAIL 
LET'S GO LIVE TO STAMFORD BRIDGE 
JONATHAN PEARCE IS ALREADY P. IN THE 
COMMENTARY POSITION WHAT'S THE 
TEAM NEWS 
IMPORTANT THREE CHANGES 
FOR CHELSEA ESSIEN FOR LAMPARD 
AFTER HE'S GRIEVING FOR HIS MUM'S 
DEATH DEATH MICKLE START HOW ABOUT MANCHESTER 
UNITED CRISTIANO RONALDO ONLY ON 
BENCH BENCH SIX CHANGES VIDIC IS FIT 
SYLVESTER PLAYS HIS FIRST GAME IN 
SEVEN MONTHS FLETCHER IS BACK 
GIGS STARTS ALONGSIDE ME IS MICKEY 
THOMAS A MAN WHO PLAYED FOR BOTH 
THESE CLUBS HOW ABOUT RONALDO ONLY 
ON THE BENCH 
YES A BIG SURPRISE 
TO EVERYONE HERE ON THE GROUND L. 
THINK HE HAS ELEVEN WORKMAN LIKE 
PLAYERS OUT THERE RONALDO IS 
FANTASTIC WHEN HE HAS THE BALL BUT 
WHEN HE HASN'T HE'S LESS EFFECTIVE 
AND PICKING A TEAM WITH THE 
EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI 
FINAL SECOND LEG IN MIND BEARING 
THAT IN MIND WHAT DO CHELSEA NEED 
TO DO TODAY TO BEAT MANCHESTER 
UNITED A AND STAY IN THE TITLE RACE 
CONSIDERING THE WAY THEY PLAYED IN 
THE WEEK WITH LIVERPOOL 
THEY HAVE 
TO BE MORE ADVENTUROUS THEY HAVE 
TO WIN THIS FOOTBALL GAME L. THINK 
THAT COULD BE A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE TO 
UNITED ON THE COUNTERATTACK DROOG 
ABOUT A ON HIS OWN AND COLE AND 
KALUE HAS TO SUPPORT HIM 
THERE ARE 
RUMOURS THAT JOHN TERRY MAY LOSE 
THE CAPTAINCY PERMANENTLY TO RIO 
FERDINAND TODAY HE WON'T WANT TO 
LOSE THE TITLE TO HIS ENGLAND 
INTERNATIONAL TEAM MATE IT WILL BE 
SOME GAME AND IT'S BOILING AT 
STAMFORD BRIDGE I CAN TELL YOU SO SO THE TEMPERATURES RISING AT STAMFORD 
BRIDGE INTERESTING TEAM NEWS 
TEVEZ AND RONALDO ON THE BENCH 
THAT'S SURELY GOT TO GIVE CHELSEA A 
LIFT AS THEY GO OUT ON THE TO THE 
PITCH 
CHELSEA JUST HAVE TO PITCH CONCENTRATE ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
TODAY THEY NEED TO WIN THE GAME 
UNITED CAN AFFORD TO LOSE THE GAME 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF 
THE TEAM HE HAS PUT OUT L. THINK 
THAT THE TEAM THAT ALEX FERGUSON 
HAS PUT OUT WILL BE WORKMAN LIKE 
HE'S GOING TO PACK THE MIDFIELD HE 
HAS A BIT OF AMMUNITION ON THE 
BENCH TO COME ON IF THEY NEED IT L. L. 
THINK THAT THE RECORD OF CHELSEA AT 
HOME I THINK THAT'S UNDER THREAT 
TODAY I KNOW THE TEAM IS A BIT 
WEAK BUT IF THEY COME AT 
MANCHESTER UNITED THEY COULD HIT ON 
THE BREAK L. THINK CHELSEA ARE IN 
FOR A TOUGH DAY TODAY 
MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE STUMBLED OF 
LATE I SUPPOSE AGAINST BARCELONA 
BLACKBURN DRAWS IN THOSE TWO GAMES 
I'M NOT SURE A ZERO TO ZERO DRAW IN THE NOU 
CAMP IS A STUMBLE THINK EWOOD 
PARK YEAH BUT THEY KEPT GOING AND 
GOING AND GOT THE LATE EQUALISER L. 
THINK THE TEAM HE HAS PICKED TODAY 
NOT A BIG PITCH CHELSEA CHELSEA 
AREN'T PARTICULARLY CREATIVE WHEN 
CHELSEA HAVEN'T GOT THE BALL THEY 
HAVE FIVE IN MIDFIELD MANCHESTER 
UNITED ARE DOING 
THE SAME THINK THE I THINK FOR MANCHESTER UNITED 
IS COME AND BEAT US IF YOU CAN 
WITH TEVEZ AND RONALDO ON THE BENCH 
IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING MANCHESTER 
UNITED YOU CAN CHANGE FROM THIS 
THERE 
LET'S HEAR FROM RMER THERE CHELSEA BOSS JOSE MOURINHO HE HAD 
A GOOD RECORD AGAINST MANCHESTER 
UNITED 
HOW DO YOU BEAT MANCHESTER UNITED 
YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT HOW DO YOU 
BEAT THEM 
WE PLAYED EIGHT OR NINE 
TIMES AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED 
OUR RECORD WAS VERY GOOD L. THINK 
CHELSEA PLAYERS KNOW HOW TO BEAT 
THEM AGAINST THEM WE DID A FEW 
THINGS THAT NORMALLY WE DON'T DO IT 
IN OTHER MATCHES 
THINGS THAT NORMALLY WE DON'T DO IT IN OTHER MATCHES 
WHY IN THIS EIGHT OR NINE MATCHES 
RONALDO DIDN'T SCORE AGAINST 
CHELSEA A PLAYER THAT IS SCORING 
EVERY GAME SO I THINK CHELSEA 
PLAYERS THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT 
WHO DO YOU FEEL WILL WIN THE GAME 
I BELIEVE MANCHESTER UNITED IS IN A 
POSITION TO WIN BETTER POSITION 
TO WIN A LEAGUE BECAUSE THEM LOSE 
AT STAMFORD BRIDGE AND AFTER THAT 
THEY STILL DEPEND OF THEMSELVES L. 
DON'T THINK THEY HAVE THE PRESSURE 
TO PLAY AT STAMFORD BRIDGE L. THINK 
THEY CAN GO THERE WITH AN OPEN MIND 
WITH AN OPEN SPIRIT WITH A LOT OF 
SELF CONFIDENCE BECAUSE IF 
SOMEBODY CAN CELEBRATE IN THAT DAY 
IT'S MANCHESTER UNITED THE ONLY 
ONE THAT CAN CELEBRATE 
AVRAM GRANT WILL DO HIS BEST TO 
COME OUT OF JOSE MOURINHO'S SHADOW 
CAN HE AFFORD TO BE CAUTIOUS THIS 
AFTERNOON 
I THINK HE'LL BE AFTERNOON CAUTIOUS FOR A WHILE WHAT YOU 
DON'T WANT TO DO IS GO GUNG HO FOR 
MANCHESTER UNITED AND BE TWO TO ZERO DOWN 
I DON'T THINK PARTICULARLY CHELSEA 
ARE GOOD AT CHASING THE GAME ANYWAY 
YOU'D ARGUE WITH THE PLAY THEY'RE 
PLAYING AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE NOT 
GOOD AT IMPOSING THEMSELVES WHAT 
THEY ARE GOOD AT DOING IS NOT 
PLAYING PARTICULARLY WELL BUT 
EKEING OUT A RESULT IF YOU HAD 
SEEN THEM AT ANFIELD ON TUESDAY 
NIGHT GOING FORWARD THEY DIDN'T 
LOOK VERY MUCH AT ALL WE DON'T 
KNOW IF DROGBA IS FULLY FIT JOE 
COLE BY HIS STANDARDS WAS POOR L. 
THINK IT WILL BE SAME OLD CHELSEA 
THEY'RE GOOD GRINDERS 
THEY WERE 
OUT OF THIS CHAMPIONSHIP RACE ALL 
OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE BACK IN IT 
THEY'VE DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB 
THEIR HOME RECORD IS OUTSTANDING L. 
FEEL MANCHESTER UNITED THE WAY 
THEY'VE PLAYED THIS SEASON WHEN 
THEY NEED A BIG PERFORMANCE THEY 
NORMALLY GET IT L. THINK THE RECORD 
MIGHT GO TODAY 
I THINK MANCHESTER 
UNITED'S RECORD AGAINST THE TOP 
FOUR IS BETTER THAN ANYBODY 
O. K. IF 
MANCHESTER UNITED ARE TO END 
CHELSEA'S INCREDIBLE EIGHTY MATCH 
UNBEATEN RECORD THEY'LL NEED 
GOALKEEPER EDWIN VAN DER SAR TO BE 
AT HIS BEST THE DUTCHMAN HAS BEEN 
SPEAKING TO MARK BRIGHT 
HOW DO YOU REFLECT ON THE SEASON SO 
FAR 
IT'S ALL SHAPING UP NICELY OF FAR COURSE WE DIDN'T START OUT TOO 
WELL AFTER THE FIRST THREE GAMES 
WE HAD TWO POINTS WE LOST AGAINST 
CITY WE DREW AGAINST READING AT 
HOME AND PORTSMOUTH AWAY SO IT 
WASN'T THE BEST OF STARTS AFTER 
THAT WE PICKED UP THE PACE WE KEPT 
ONGOING ONGOING AND SLOWLY WE REGAINED OUR 
CONFIDENCE AND STARTED TO PLAY 
BETTER AND CLIMB OUT OF THE TABLE 
THE MANAGER SAID EVEN THREE MONTHS 
AGO IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE 
TIGHTEST FINISHES EVER ARSENAL 
DROPPED OUT A LITTLE BIT SINCE THAT 
THAT'S MADE IT LIKE A TWO HORSE 
RACE AT THE MOMENT HOPEFULLY WE 
CAN STAY IN FRONT OF CHELSEADO YOU YOU FEEL YOUR FOOTBALL HAS DESERVED THE 
TITLE THIS YEAR 
MMM BUT YOU DON'T 
ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU DESERVE 
EVERYBODY WORKS HARD FOR IT 
EVERYBODY FOCUSES IT MAKES IT MORE 
REWARDING IN THE END IF YOU WIN IT 
THAT YOU REALLY DESERVED IT YOU'VE YOU'VE PLAYED IN MANY GREAT TEAMS HOW 
DOES THIS TEAM RANK 
IT'S OBVIOUS 
WE GOT GOOD QUALITY WE GOT WINNERS 
ALL OVER THE PITCH YOU GOT GOOD 
DEFENDERS GOOD MIDFIELDERS A 
COUPLE OF STRIKERS WHO ARE NOT BAD 
EITHER EITHER IT'S WELL BALANCED I THINK BUT 
YOU ONLY GET THE ACCOLADES AND 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THAT IF YOU WIN 
BIG THINGS WE HAVEN'T WON THAT YET 
SO TO REALLY GET GOOD SIDE BE A 
GREAT TEAM YOU HAVE TO WIN 
SOMETHING BIG THAT HAS TO BE 
BIGGER THAN THE PREMIERSHIP YOU'RE YOU'RE CLOSE TO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 
YOU'VE WON IT BEFORE WITH AJAX HOW 
IMPORTANT IS IT FOR MANCHESTER 
UNITED TO BE CHALLENGING FOR THIS 
TROPHY AND MAJOR HONOURS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THIS CLUB IS ALL ABOUT 
WINNING THINGS THEY WON IT TWICE 
IN THE PAST THEY WON A LOT IN 
ENGLAND IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS TO 
REALLY THEY REALLY DOMINATE TO 
REALLY DOMINATE IN THE EUROPEAN 
PLATFORM WE HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY 
AND BEAT BARCELONA AND GO TO THE 
FINAL IN MOSCOW AND BEAT THE TEAM 
THAT'S GOING TO BE THERE 
HOW IMPORTANT IS YOUR CONSISTENCY 
FOR MANCHESTER UNITED 
IT'S BEEN 
VERY IMPORTANT 
IT'S BEEN CRUCIAL 
NO OF COURSE YOU ALWAYS SAY YOU 
DO YOUR JOB AND I'M HAPPY WITH MY 
FORM AND THE PLAYERS THEY 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE MANAGER 
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT AND THAT'S FOR 
YOURSELF THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL 
ABOUT THE PLAYERS ARE HAPPY THAT 
YOU'RE PLAYING AND IF YOU'RE 
INJURED IT'S WHEN ARE YOU BACK WE 
NEED YOU THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT AND 
THAT'S WHAT I'M GETTING FROM THE 
TEAM AROUND ME 
AT THIRTY SEVEN ARE YOU APY 
TO PLAY ON AT MANCHESTER UNITED IT IT DEPENDS ON HOW IT GOES AT MY AGE 
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FORWARD TWO OR 
THREE YEARS IN THE FUTURE YOU TAKE 
IT YEAR BY YEAR WHATEVER HAPPENS 
HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR CAN END 
NICELY AND SEE WHAT'S IN STORE FOR 
NEXT YEAR 
AS FAR AS THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IS 
CONCERNED THERE IS EDWIN VAN DER 
SAR WARMING UP AGAINST CHELSEA THIS 
AFTERNOON HOW KEY IS HE GOING TO 
BE AGAINST UNITED LEE 
VERY MUCH 
SO L. DON'T CARE HOW GOOD YOUR 
BACKFOUR IS AND MANCHESTER 
UNITED'S BACK FOUR IS BRILLIANT YOU 
NEED THAT BEHIND YOU HIS CALMING 
INFLUENCE GIVES YOU THAT WE HAD 
DAVID SEE MAN IN THOSE DAYS AND 
KNOWING HE WAS BEHIND YOU GAVE YOU 
CONFIDENCE 
WHAT'S INTERESTING IN CONFIDENCE MANCHESTER UNITED'S TEAM IS 
SYLVESTER PLAYING OUTBREAK 
HE 
HASN'T GOT THAT MANY MENTIONS BUT 
HE HAS HAD A VERY GOOD SEASON AND AND STILL WORKING HIS WAY BACK FROM 
INJURY 
EXACTLY THE ONLY PROBLEM INJURY IS HAVE CHELSEA GOT THE PLAYERS 
THAT WILL SERIOUSLY PROBE AND PLAY 
AGAINST SYLVESTER 
I'M NOT SURE 
AND ON TUESDAY NIGHT 
MANCHESTER UNITED AGAINST BARCELONA 
FERGIE SAYS HE'LL ATTACK BARCELONA 
IS THAT THE BEST WAY TO PLAY IT I I THINK YOU HAVE TO ATTACK THEM BUT 
BY THE SAME TOKEN BARCELONA WHO 
DIDN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE SCORING THE 
OTHER NIGHT ALWAYS LOOKED LIKE 
SCORING AWAY FROM HOME IF THE GAME 
OPENS OUT AND THE WAY THEY KEEP THE 
BALL AS WELL AS YOU WOULD BE 
WORRIED THEY'LL SCORE 
WE ALL HOPE 
IT DOES OPEN OUT BECAUSE THERE'S 
SUCH TALENT GOING FORWARD AND WITH 
BARCELONA NOT THE BEST AT DEFENDING 
IT SHOULD BE A CRACKER AND AND MANCHESTER UNITED NEED TO KEEP THE 
BALL MORE YEAH 
YEAH THE PASSING YEAH WAS POOR 
TUESDAY WILL SEE THE RETURN OF 
THIERRY HENRY TO THESE SHORES SINCE 
HIS MOVE TO BARCELONA GARTH CROOKS 
HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO HIM BARCELONA BARCELONA IS ALMOST LIKE THE NATIONAL TEAM OF 
CATALONIA WHEN WE ARE NOT 
PERFORMING THEY ARE GOING TO 
HAMMER YOU THE GUYS FROM ARSENAL 
THEY WANT TO SEE THE GUY FROM 
ARSENAL I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN 
DON'T EXPECT THE HENRY FROM ARSENAL 
IT IS NOT THE SAME THING IF YOU 
ASK ANY CENTRE FORWARD TO PLAY ON 
THE WING HE WILL DO HIS BEST BUT 
WILL HE BE AS EFFICIENT AS WHAT HE 
CAN DO AS A CENTRE FORWARD L. DON'T 
THINK SO 
ARE YOU HAPPY HERE YES 
THINK SO YES BUT THE THING IS HOW CAN I 
EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU I'M HAPPY BUT 
YOU NEVER HAPPY WHEN IT IS NOT WHAT 
YOU WERE EXPECTING L. WAS THE SAME 
AT ARSENAL IT IS ONLY BECAUSE I'M 
AT BARCELONA YOU CAN SEE WHEN I 
WAS AT ARSENAL I USED TO GET 
HAMMERED FOR THAT WHEN I HAD 
MOODY FACE BUT I'M A GUY PEOPLE 
KNOWS ME WILL TELL YOU I'M THE 
SAME IN TRAINING I'M THE SAME IN 
LIFE CANNOT ACT THAT SOMETIMES

ASSIST PER SEASON BUT IT IS STILL 
FOURTEEN GOAL AND TEN ASSISTS AS A WINGER

THERE IS ONLY ONE TEAM IN ENGLAND 
FOR ME 
IF THERE IS EVER A CHANCE 
I'M JUST SAYING THERE IS ONLY ONE 
TEAM FOR ME EVERYONE KNOWS THE 
LOVE AND THE AFFECTION I HAVE FOR 
ARSENAL IT WASN'T IT TOOK ME 
WHILE TO UNDERSTAND TO UNDERSTAND 
WHAT THAT CLUB MEANT AND EVERYTHING 
PEOPLE SOMETIMES THINK THAT 
SOMETIMES THAT IS WHY I WAS MAD 
BECAUSE I WAS SO INTO IT L. BECAME 
A FAN ACTUALLY BECAME A FAN 
THAT IS WHAT IT IS I BECAME FAN 
DO YOU REGRET LEAVING 
NO I DON'T 
DON'T REGRET STUFF IN MY LIFE 
STUFF HAPPENED FOR A REASON FOR 
WHATEVER REASON IN MY LIFE IN MY 
PERSONAL LIFE ALSO L. DON'T REGRET STUFF 
ENYOU WALKED OUT HERE UP STUFF THOSE STEP YOU GO ON THE PITCH AND 
THE LIGHTS HIT YOU IT IS A MASSIVE 
STAGE DO YOU FEEL THAT STAGE 
PEOPLES AS THOUGH ITS YOURS LIKE 
ARSENAL ONE 
HIGHBOROUGH BRI THE 
OTHER STADIUM HIGHBURY AND THE 
OTHER STADIUM HIGHBURY WAS 
HIGHBURY L. SAID TO MANY TIMES IT 
WAS MY GARDEN THAT IS A DIFFERENT 
STORY 
MANCHESTER UNITED AT OLD RA STORY FORD YOU ARE TAILOR MADE FOR THE 
ENGLISH LEAGUE AND ENGLISH 
OPPOSITION T. STAGE SEEMS TO BE SET 
FOR THIERRY HENRY AT OLD TRAFFORD 
ZERO TO ZERO WINNER TAKES ALL 
THE STAGE IS 
ALSO SET FOR RONALDO TO WIN IT OR 
TEVEZ TO WIN IT THE STAGE FOR 
ANYBODY TO WIN IT SO I JUST THINK 
THAT YEAH EVERYONE WILL LIKE THAT 
STORY BUT YOU KNOW THE GUYS ARE 
GOING TO BE IN THE STADIUM AFTER 
THE PENALTY THAT HE MISSED 
YESTERDAY YOU KNOW HE LOOKS 
LIKE THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE THE 
RIGHT SCENARIO RIGHT NOW IF YOU 
THINK ABOUT THE SEASON HE HAD AND 
EVERYTHING THE RIGHT ENDING BUT 
YOU ALWAYS LIKE IN NEW MOVIES NOW 
YOU ALWAYS HAVE LIKE OTHER ENDING 
MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT 
THIERRY HENRY 
THIERRY HENRY ALMOST SOUNDING HOME SICK DO YOU 
SEE HIM COMING BACK TO ARSENAL I I WOULD BE FLABBERGASTED IF HE DID 
HE LEFT PROBABLY AT THE RIGHT TIME 
FOR HIM AND THE CLUB L. CAN'T 
IMAGINE ARSENE WENGER BRINGING HIM 
PACK AT THE AGE OF THIRTY HE HAS HAD 
SOME INJURIES AND ALSO INTO THE 
DRESSING ROOM THAT HE LEFT THAT 
HAS COME ON A HUGE AMOUNT SINCE HE 
LEFT THE TEAM SPIRIT AND THE WAY 
THE TEAM HAS GELLED SINCE THE KING 
LEFT SO TO SPEAK TO BRING HIM BACK 
INTO THAT ENVIRONMENT WHAT DOES 
ADEBAYOR DO IT WOULD BE THE WRONG 
MOVE I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF HE 
CAME BACK 
I THINK HE HAS BEEN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE PLAYER I HAVE 
SEEN BUT YOU KNOW ARSENAL T. WAY 
THEY PLAYED WAS BUILT AROUND HIM 
AND TO SUIT HIM BUILT FOR HIS 
NEEDS LEE SAYS THEY WOULD HAVE TO 
CHANGE IF HE CAME BACK HE HAS GONE 
TO BARCELONA AND BARCELONA'S TEAM 
ISN'T BUILT AROUND HIM BUT ABOUT 
MESSI OR RONALDINHO SO HE HAS TO 
STRUGGLE BUT THAT I SEE HIM 
LEAVING BECAUSE HE IS A LATED HE 
IS NOT HAPPY YOU CAN CAN TELL WHEN 
HE IS PLAYING LAD 
HE HAS BEEN 
PLAYED OUT OF POSITION 
WELL I 
MEAN FOR ARSENAL HE PLAYED DOWN THE 
MIDDLE BUT HE ENDED UP ON THE LEFT 
BARCELONA HAVE STUCK HIM ON THE 
LEFT ANY WAY HE HAS PLAYED THROUGH 
MIDDLE IT HAS NOT WORKED FOR HIM 
I THINK HE WILL MOVE ON AS TO 
WHERE I'M NOT SURE 
HIS BASIS HIS 
MAJOR ASSET AS SOON AS YOU START 
TO LOSE THAT HE IS NOT HAPPY OFF 
THE PITCH HE HAS PROBLEMS WITH 
FAMILY LIFE THAT UPSETS HIM HE IS 
A MOODY SORT OF PLAYER HE NEEDS TO 
BE BANG ON HIS GAME AND IF HE IS 
NOT ALL THE THINGS HAVE COMPOUNDED 
BUT HE IS AN EXCEPTIONAL STRIKER 
HE WILL BOUNCE BACK 
THERE ARE 
PLAYERS YOU CAN SLAUGHTER AND GET A 
REACTION YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR ARM 
AROUND HIM 
WHO DO YOU SEE HIM 
COMING THROUGH ON TUESDAY 
MANCHESTER UNITED DITTO 
NOW THE DITTO OTHER CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI FINALS 
IT IS ONE TO ONE BETWEEN CHELSEA AND 
LIVERPOOL HERE IS WHAT JOSE 
MOURINHO THINKS 
LIVERPOOL HERE IS WHAT JOSE MOURINHO THINKS 
DID YOU WATCH I 
WONDER HOW MUCH YOU SMILED WHEN 
RIISE HEADED IN THAT GOAL YOU 
REMEMBER THE GHOST GOAL 
YES I 
THINK IT IS FAIR THEY WERE LUCKY 
THAT TIME CHELSEA WAS LUCKY THIS 
TIME 
IT IS ADVANTAGE CHELSEA FOR TIME THE SECOND LEG 
NO IT IS A 
DIFFERENT RESULT ONE ZERO OR ONE TO ONE 
IS A DIFFERENT RESULT BUT YOU KNOW 
I'M NOT A MAN OF PERCENTAGES BUT I 
STILL THINK IT IS FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. CHELSEA CHELSEA FANS ARE WORRIED THAT BENITEZ WILL 
BE MORE EXPERIENCED AND CLEVER THAN 
AVRAM GRANT THAT LIVERPOOL WILL 
FIND A WAY PAST 
I DON'T KNOW L. 
THINK THAT AT THIS LEVEL L. THINK 
DETAILS MAKE THE DIFFERENCE L. 
DON'T THINK IT IS BECAUSE A GOOD 
MANAGER OR A BAD MANAGER THAT RIISE 
SCORE ON HIS OWN GOAL L. THINK 
LIVERPOOL AND CHELSEA SUPPORTERS 
HAVE BOTH BOTH SIDES TO BE WORRIED 
WITH 
THE THE I DON'T KNOW IF IS THE CORRECT WORD UNPREDICTABLE OF THE GAME 
THE NATURE OF THE DRAW 
FOR LIVERPOOL AND RIISE'S GOAL MADE 
IT FEEL LIKE A DEFEAT FOR WHRIFPLT 
HAVE NEVER KNOWN A GOAL GREETED 
WITH SUCH SILENCE LIVERPOOL 
THINK THERE IS AN ADVANTAGE IN THAT 
TO CHELSEA L. HAVE FEELING THIS 
MAY GO TO EXTRA TIME AND PENALTIES 
AGAIN I KNOW LIVERPOOL HAVEN'T GOT 
A GOOD RECORD AT STAMFORD BRIDGE 
BUT IT IS A DIFFICULT ONE PSYCHE 
LODGE C. I. FOR PSYCHOLOGICALLY FOR 
CHELSEA LIVERPOOL HAVE TO SCORE 
THEIR TACTICS DON'T NEED TO VARY 
BUT CHELSEA MAY HAVE TO CHANGE MID 
STREAM 
LIVERPOOL HAVE TO SCORE IT STREAM HAS BEEN OVER FOUR YEARS SINCE 
THEIR LAST GOAL AT CHELSEA WHO 
SCORED 
BRUNO CHEREOUX HE IS NOW SCORED WORKING TESCO 
THAT WAS A HUGE 
ADVANTAGE NOW FOR CHELSEA TAKING 
THEM BACK WITH THAT AWAY GOAL DO DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
YES IT IS ONE 
OF THOSE STRANGE THINGS MAYBE WHEN 
THIS GAME IS OVER AND WHOEVER GOES 
THROUGH AND YOU LOOK AT THE TWO 
GAMES AND IT IS PROBABLY A MOMENT 
YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN PAUSE WHY HE 
DIDN'T CLEAR IT WITH HIS RIGHT FOOT 
BECAUSE L. SUGGEST HE PROBABLY 
DOESN'T KNOW 
WITH THAT GAME COMING 
UP THE TEAM SELECTION FOR 
LIVERPOOL WILL COME UNDER SCRUET 
INN BY THOSE BATTLING WITH 
BIRMINGHAM TO BEAT THE DROP JOHN 
MOTSON IS AT BIRMINGHAM THIS IS 
ONE OF BIRMINGHAM'S HARDEST 
FIXTURES BUT IT IS A MUST WIN GAME 
YES A STATISTIC BIRMINGHAM HAVE 
NEVER LOST TO LIVERPOOL IN T. R. 
LEAGUE SINCE RAFAEL BENITEZ TOOK 
OVER AT LIVERPOOL THERE IS SOME 
HISTORY THERE ON BIRMINGHAM'S SIDE 
BUT AFTER THAT BATTERING THEY TOOK 
AT VILLA OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE GOT 
TO REGROUP TODAY THEY HAVE GOT TO 
HOPE THAT LIVERPOOL PLAY WHAT WE 
CALL A BELOW STRENGTH SIDE I'M 
CERTAIN LIVERPOOL WILL MAKE CHANGES 
AS FOR BIRMINGHAM I THINK THAT THE 
KEY MIGHT BE WHETHER OR NOT 
FORSSELL GETS BACK INTO THE 
STARTING LINE UP AND LARSON THOSE 
ARE TWO KEY PLAYERS WITH WHOM 
BIRMINGHAM ARE A BETTER SIDE YOU YOU MENTIONED THE DERBY HAMMERING TO 
VILLA ALEX MCLEISH WILL HAVE TO 
PICK UP THE PLAYERS 
AFTER THIS 
GAME BIRMINGHAM GO TO FULHAM AND 
IT COULD BE A SIX POINTER 
DEPENDING ON WHAT FULHAM DO TODAY 
AND THEY FINISH AT HOME TO 
BLACKBURN THEY COULD LOOK AT THEIR 
LAST TWO GAME AND THINK THEY ARE 
WINNABLE BUT THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY BECAUSE AS THINGS 
STAND BIRMINGHAM ARE STILL IN THE 
BOTTOM THREE IF THEY WERE TO WIN 
TODAY AND PULL THEMSELVES CLEAR OF 
THAT THEN THEY CAN SEE DAYLIGHT 
BUT IT WILL BE CLOSE I THINK THANK THANK YOU THE LEAGUE TABLE DOES NOT MAKE 
GREAT READING FOR BLUES FANS 
YOU THE LEAGUE TABLE DOES NOT MAKE GREAT READING FOR BLUES FANS 
NO ONE IS MORE DESPERATE TO SEE 
WANDERS ESCAPE THAN KEVIN NOLAN IT 
HAS BEEN A ROLLERCOASTER SEASON 
WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE FOR YOU AS AS YOU AS YOU SAY IT HAS BEEN THE SAME FOR 
US UP AND DOWN WHEN GARY TOOK 
OVER WE SEEM TO BE GOING IN THE 
RIGHT DIRECTION WE GOT OUT OF THE 
BOTTOM THREE AND WERE DOING WELL 
IT TOOK A TURN FOR T. R. WORSE 
BUT WE 
HAVE GOT OURSELF TOGETHER 
WHAT HAS 
THAT COME FROM 
TO BE HONEST A LOT 
OF IT IT WAS BELIEF IN EACH OTHER 
I THINK A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN ABOUT 
LUCK ESPECIALLY ON SATURDAY THE 
FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES MIDDLESBROUGH HAD 
A GOOD GOAL AND APART FROM HIM 
PULLING THE SAVES OFF WE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN TWO OR THREE DOWN BUT WE 
DID HIS JOB AND WE DID AFTER THAT 
AND WE GOT THE RESULT WE DESERVED 
BOLTON ARE IN DREAM LAND HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY MIDDLESBROUGH CAN DO US A FAVOUR 
AND KEEP SUNDERLAND IN OUR GRACE 
GRASP AND WE CAN WIN AGAIN AND GET 
CLOSER TO SUNDERLAND THAT IS OUR 
INTENTION THIS WEEKEND WE WANT TO 
WIN AND HOPEFULLY COME AWAY WITH 
THE POINTS THE FOCUS HAS TO BE ON 
US WE CAN'T RELY ON OTHER TEAMS TO 
SLIP UP IT IS IN OUR OWN HANDS WE 
ARE ABOVE THEM ON POINTS READING 
AND BIRMINGHAM WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE 
SURE WE STAY ABOVE THEM AND COME FIVE 
O'CLOCK SATURDAY WE ARE STILL ABOVE 
THEM 
DO YOU THINK THE FORM AND THE THEM CHANCES YOU HAVE GIVEN YOURSELVES 
HAS VINDICATED GARY MEGSON AND THE 
DECISION TO TAKE HIM ON 
WHEN HE 
TOOK THE JOB THERE WAS NOT MANY 
CANDIDATES FOR THE JOB L. WAS 
DELIGHTED WITH THE APPOINTMENT AND 
I STILL AM HE CAN TAKE US FURTHER 
AND KEEP US IN THE LEAGUE AND GET 
US BACK 
TO WHERE WE BELONG L. DON'T TO BECOME AN UNSTABLE CLUB IF WE 
KEEP SACKING MANAGERS WE COULD GO 
THAT WAY AND THERE WOULD BE ONLY 
ONE PLACE WE WOULD BE GOING AND 
THAT IS DOWN 
IS THEREBY T. H. R. HAS 
BEEN VOICES OF DISCONTENT AMONG THE 
FANS 
I HAVE SEEN 
A IT BUT I KNOW FANS A LOT OF SEASON TICKET HOLDERS AND 
THEY UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION WE 
ARE IN THE SUPPORTERERS WHO ARE 
THERE WEEK IN WEEK OUT THEY KNOW

RIGHT DIRECTION 
DIOUF SUCTED HE 
WON'T BE ALONG NEXT SEASON WHAT DO 
YOU MAKE OF THE REMARK AND THE TIME 
OF THEM SUGGESTED

FOR HIM TO SAY IT IF THAT IS HOW 
HE FEELS HE GOES WE JUST MOVE ON 
HE HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC SERVANT TO 
THIS CLUB L. HAVE ENJOYED PLAYING 
WITH HIM HOPEFULLY IF WE STAY UP 
HE SPLAY A CHANGE OF MIND IF HE 
WANTS TO GO HE GOES THAT IS THE 
SIMPLE BE ALL AND END ALL 
IT IS 
NOT THE SITUATION WHERE YOU WOULD 
WANT TO DISCUSS YOUR FUTURE IS 
THAT SOMETHING IN YOUR MIND

HAVE NOT EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT I'M 
STILL HAPPY AT THIS CLUB AND I WILL 
BE AT THIS CLUB UNTIL THEY WANT TO 
GET RID OF ME L. HAVE ALWAYS SAID 
WHICH NEVER PUT A TRANSFER REQUEST 
IN L. WILL STAND BY THAT TO TODAY 
IF WE GO DOWN I WON'T SAY I WANT 
TO LEAVE WU O' BUT I BELIEVE 
WE WILL BE IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
AND I WILL BE A BOLTON PLAYER 
THEIR FORM HAS PICKED UP IS IT A 
GOOD TIME TO PLAY SPURS 
WILL GEL 
YOU AT FIVE O'CLOCK FOR GOAL ON THE 
THEY SCRAP WHEN THEY ARE PLAYING 
WELL IF YOU LOOK AT TEAMS ARPBTD 
THEM BIRMINGHAM AND READING ARE 
NOT SO BUT WEST HAM AT HOME 
MIDDLESBROUGH FOR I TWENTY MINUTES 
THEY WERE PUMELED BUT THEY HUNG ON 
AND PINCHED A GOAL L. DON'T FANCY 
THEM AT TOTTENHAM BUT THAEFR 
CHANCE 
IT DEPENDS WHAT TOTTENHAM CHANCE TEAM TURNS UP IF THEY FANCY IT AND 
ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT THEIR 
HOLIDAYS THEY COULD PLAY A GOOD 
GAME AND BOLTON ARE IN TROUBLE WE WE HAVE E. MAIL RAISE RAISE WHY HAS 
NOLAN NEVER BEEN CAPPED AT SENIOR 
LEVEL 
LEVEL 
THERE IS NOT MANY GOAL LEVEL SCORING MIDFIELDER BUT 
CONSISTENCYWISE HE NEEDS TO PLAY 
NOR CONSIS SENTENT TENTH AND BE 
REGULARLY PUSH FOR A PLACE TALKING TALKING OF THE TEAMS AT THE BOTTOM 
BIRMINGHAM'S FORM HAS DIPPED BUT 
STEPHEN IS KELLY IS OPTIMISTIC THEY 
CAN TURN THINGS AROUND 
THE GAMES WE HAVE REMAINING HOME 
FORM HAS BEEN GOOD AWAY HAS NOT 
BEEN SO GOOD BUT WE'RE MORE THAN 
CAPABLE OF GETTING THE POINTS WE 
NEED LAST WEEK WAS A BAD RESULT 
EMBARRASSING FOR LOT OF US BUT 
IT'S MATTER OF GETTING ON WITH 
THE FOOTBALL NOW THE NEXT GAME 
COMES ON SATURDAY AND IF WE WIN 
THAT GAME EVERYTHING CAN BE PUT 
RIGHT 
KELLY CALLED IT EMBARRASSING RIGHT THIS IS A COUPLE OF THE FIVE GOALS 
THEY THEY WERE BEATEN BY VILLA LAST 
NIGHT 
I'M IT CAN'T GET ANY 
WORSE THEY'VE GOT YUPBLG AND 
RELATIVELY INEXPERIENCED TEAM BUT 
I FANCY THEY MIGHT PICK SOMETHING 
UP FROM THE LIVERPOOL GAME 
DO YOU 
SEE THEM STAIFG OFF RELEGATION I I DO DO THIS IS RUNDOWN OF THE WEEKEND'S 
GAME IN THE 
BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE 
GAME IN THE BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE A WIN FOR EITHER SUNDERLAND OR 
BORO WILL ENSURE THEY'RE ALL BUT 
SAFE WIGAN FACIAL A READING SIDE 
DESPERATE FOR A WIN 
TOMORROW THERE'S GAME BETWEEN THE 
TWO SIDES CHALLENGING FOR A PLACE 
IN THE UEFA CUP WITH EVERTON UP 
AGAINST ASTON VILLA 
THREE POINTS THEN SEPARATE VILLA IN 
SIXTH AND EVERTON IN FIFTH EVERTON 
HAVEN'T BEEN OUT OF THE TOP FIVE 
FOR THREE MONTHS VILLA HAVE SCORED 
FIFTEEN GOALS IN THEIR LAST THREE GAMES 
THEY'RE ON FIRE 
EVERTON HAVE RUN 
OUT OF GAS CAHILL AND A AT THE 
TIME AHAVE BEEN OUT OF THE TEAM 
THEY'RE THE BEST TWO PLAYERS I 
THINK IF YOU TALK ABOUT BEING A 
COMEDIAN AS IN TIMING FOR ASTON 
VILLA THE TIMING OF THE RUN IS 
BRILLIANT AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE FIFTEEN 
GOALS IN THE LAST THREE GAMES L. 
THINK THEY MIGHT WIN TOMORROW THEY THEY HAVE THE EASIEST RUN IN IF THEY 
CAN GET A RESULT TOMORROW EVERTON 
HAVE TWO TOUGH GAMES TO FINISH WITH 
AT ARSENAL AND NEWCASTLE 
MARTIN O'NEILL HAS CHAPBGDZ HIS 
PLAYERS TO GET THROUGH THE REST OF 
THE SEASON UNBEATEN CAN THEY DO 
THAT CHALLENGED HIS PLAYERS I I DON'T SEE WHY NOT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
CONFIDENCE NEWCASTLE LOOK A GOOD 
SIDE AND WHEN KEVIN KEEGAN TOOK 
OVER THEY WERE ALL OVER THE PLACE 
VILLA THE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE 
SEASON HAD AN IFY SPELL NOW BRING 
ON ANYBODY 
TOP GOAL SCORERS AWAY 
FROM HOME THEY GO AWAY AND PLAY 
WITH A FREEDOM OTHER TEAMS ARE NOT 
DOING 
IS DAVID MOYES IN DANGER OF DOING SEEING A FABULOUS SEASON SLIP AWAY 
AT A CRUCIAL STAGE 
WOULD THEY HAVE 
TAKEN SIXTH AT THE START OF THE 
SEASON L. THINK THEY WOULD THEY THEY WON'T TAKE SIXTH NOW 
IT'S A BIT 
LIKE MANCHESTER CITY LOOK AT THE 
START THEY HAD SIXTH IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE NOW WITH THE THE 
RESOURCES OR LACK OF THAT EVERTON 
HAVE IS STILL A GOOD FINISH YOU YOU CAN SEE HIGHLIGHTS OF EVERTON V. 
VILLA ON MATCH OF THE DAY TWO

OTHER 
SHAPING UP TO BE A FANTASTIC OTHER SEASON FOR RANGERS K. THEY OVERCOME 
FIORENTINA AND MAKE THE FINAL OF 
THE UEFA CUP

THURSDAY THEIR AWAY FORM IN UEFA 
HAS BEEN VERY GOOD ION IN BREMEN 
THEY GOT A VITAL AWAY GOAL 
I SAW FIORENTINA AT HOME AGAINST 
EVERTON THEY MAKE A LOT OF CHANCES 
AT HOME IT MAY BE ONE TOO MANY FOR 
THEM 
THE INJURIES AND SUSPENSIONS THEM ARE PILING UP

THEY HAVE QUEEN THE SOUTH IN THE 
SCOTTISH CUP FINAL THEY'RE MASSIVE 
FAVOURITES THEY MIGHT END UP WITH

BAD 
SOME CONSOLATION I SUPPOSE BAD HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE S. P. L. 
THIS WEEKEND 
THEY'VE ALREADY KICKED OFF AT FIR 
PARK AND IT'S ONE TO ZERO TO MOTHERWELL 
ANYTHING LESS THAN A WIN FOR CELTIC 
IN TOMORROW'S OLD FIRM MEETING WILL 
SEE RANGERS TAKE A BIG STEP TO 
WRAPPING UP THE TITLE RACELET'S 
TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
WHERE THERE'S JUST TWO GAMES LEFT 
OF THE 
SEASON IF HULL AND BRISTOL 
CITY BOTH FAIL TO WIN TODAY LEADERS 
WEST BROM WILL BE CELEBRATING 
PROMOTION PROMOTION STOKE CAN ALSO GO UP IF RESULTS GO 
THEIR WAY TOO 
AT THE BOTTOM ANY ONE OF SIXTH 
FORMER PREMIER LEAGUE SIDES COULD 
BE JOINING COLCHESTER AND 
SCUNTHORPE IN THE THIRD TIER OF 
BRITISH FOOTBALL 
I'VE BEEN TO SEE MANAGERS OF TWO 
CLUBS 
CLUBS 
IT'S THE BIGGEST GAME I'VE CLUBS EVER HAD IN MY CAREER IT'S A 
PRIVILEGE TO HAVE THE 
RESPONSIBILITY AND A LOT OF THE 
FANS ARE NERVOUS WE DON'T WANT TO 
BE DOWN THERE GO WHERE WE'VE NEVER 
BEEN BEFORE BUT IT'S SUCH HONOUR 
THESE ARE NERVOUS TIMES FOR 
EVERYBODY WE'RE TRYING TO STAY AS 
CALM AS WE CAN IT'S HUGE GAME 
FOR LEICESTER FOR OURSELVES 
NOBODY HAS TO DISGUISE THAT IN ANY 
WAY SHAPE OR FORM THERE'S A LOT AT 
STAKE AND PRIDE AND YOU NAME IT 
IT'S ALL IN THE HAT 
HOW TOUGH HAS 
IT BEEN FOR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS 
HERE 
IT'S BEEN VERY VERY TOUGH HERE THE FANS HAVE BEEN OUT STANDING 
WITH MYSELF AND THE PLAYERS THAT'S 
BEEN VERY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE 
WHEN YOU BELIEVE THE SUPPORTERS ARE 
RIGHT BEHIND YOU YOU HAVE A CHANCE 
THERE WAS A LOT OF OPTIMISM LAST 
SUMMER AND THINGS HAVEN'T GONE THE 
WAY THE CHAIRMAN OR ANY OF THE 
MANAGERS WANTED WE HAVE TO LOOK AT 
IT AND LOOK AT REASONS WHY AND I 
THINK THE PLAYERS UNDERSTAND THAT 
THEY'VE GOT TO DO LITTLE BIT 
BETTER AS WELL WE'RE GROUP OF 
PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO BOND TOGETHER 
AND FIGHT FOR THIS LOGO THIS BADGE 
IF THEY DON'T IF THEY HAVEN'T GOT 
THE RIGHT FEELINGS ABOUT IT THEN 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN I'VE GOT 
TO SAY WHEN I FIRST CAME I DIDN'T 
THINK THAT WAS ANYTHING LIKE RIGHT 
BUT AT THIS PRECISE MOMENT I 
BELIEVE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO 
DO AND THEY'RE READY TO GO OUT AND 
DO IT 
WE'RE USED TO THIS PRESSURE 
WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR SO LONG THAT 
WE'RE NOT PANICKING THE PLAYERS 
ARE QUITE RELAXED THAT TELLS ME WE 
HAVE A GREAT CHANCE L. KNOW 
SOMETIMES IT CAN BE SO TENSE I'VE 
BEEN PART OF THAT TENSENESS WHEN I 
WAS AT NOTTINGHAM FOREST AS A 
PLAYER WE THOUGHT NOTTINGHAM WOULD 
NEVER GO DOWN EVERYBODY TOLD US WE 
WERE TOO GOOD FOR AT THAT AND WE 
BELIEVED IT 
BRIAN CLOUGH WILL BE 
LOOKING DOWN THINKING WILL HIS OLD 
BOY BE ABLE TO GET OUT THIS HAVE 
STICKY MESS WHAT WOULD HE SAY TO 
YOU 
I THINK HE WOULD BE VERY YOU DETERMINED TO MAKE SURE WE DID 
OVERTAKE LESS TERP THE RIVALRY 
BETWEEN LEICESTER AND FOREST WILL 
BE VERY STRONG IF HE'S LOOKING 
OVER OUR SHOULDERS I'M SURE HE'LL 
BE CHEERING US ON 
HOW IMPORTANT IS 
THE ROLE OF YOUR FAMILY THAT'S THE 
AWKWARD THING I HAD EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD 
TWINS WHO WERE AT COLLEGE IN 
NORWICH THEY'VE MISSED THIS YEAR 
MORE OR LESS MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER 
HAS TO DO HER LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL 
AGAIN THAT'S THE HARDEST BIT ABOUT 
IT I HAVE SOME QUITE UNHAPPY YOUNG 
PEOPLE IN MY HOUSE WHO THINK I'M A 
LITTLE BIT SELFISH BUT MY WIFE HAS 
BEEN WITH ME ALL THE WAY ALONG THE 
LINE SHE'S HAD A DIFFICULT YEAR 
BECAUSE SHE LOST HER MUM THIS YEAR 
AS WELL TO BREAST CANCER 
BUT WE'VE HAD FOUR HOUSES IN TWENTY FOUR 
HOURS THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE TO 
FOOTBALL M. M. YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE 
YOU ARE YOU NEVER KNOW WHETHER 
YOU'RE ON SOLID GROUND OR NOT 
WHEN YOUR BACK IS AGAINST THE WALL 
YOU HAVE TO COME OUT FIGHTING 
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO WHEN WHEN YOU'RE DOWN IN THE DUMPS AND 
THERE'S NO ONE TO TURN TO BECAUSE 
IT CAN BE SUCH A LONELY LIFE AS A 
MANAGER SOMETIMES YOUR FAMILY ARE 
ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE STABLE PART 
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT REALLY ARE 
THE IMPORTANT PART PARTICULARLY 
FOR MYSELF I HAVE A GREAT FAMILY 
MY WIFE IS A TRUE SHEFFIELD 
WEDNESDAY FAN 
I SHOULD THINK 
YOU'RE NOT IN HER GOOD BOOKS THIS 
SEASON 
WE WENT THROUGH A STICKY SEASON PATCH SHE IS SPEAKING TO ME NOW 
SHE'S WILLING US ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH SHE'S VERY SUPPORTIVE 
THAT IS IMPORTANT EVERY MANAGER 
WILL TELL THAT BEHIND EVERY 
GOOD MANAGER IS A GOOD WOMAN 
THERE IT IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP THE SOONER THE SEASON 
ENDS THE BETTER WHO DO YOU SEE 
FILLING THAT ALL IMPORTANT TWENTY SECOND 
SPOT 
SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY I'M SPOT AFRAID WHO ARE ALREADY IN THERE 
THAT COULD BE A WARNING TO A LOT OF 
THE CLUBS WHO WILL BE PROMOTED THIS 
SEASON TO THE PREMIERE 
LOOK COVENTRY NORWICH BARNSLEY 
LEICESTER ALL HAVE BEEN IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS 
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU CHASE A DREAM 
THIS IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN SHEFFIELD 
WEDNESDAY HAD AN AWFUL START TO THE 
SEASON AND SEEMED TO PICK UP BUT 
THEY'VE HAD HORRENDOUS INJURIES A 
FANTASTIC INCENTIVE TODAY FOR 
LEICESTER TO WIN THAT GAME AND 
SOUTHAMPTON LOOKING OVER THEIR 
SHOULDERS THEY GO TO WEST BROM ON 
MONDAY NIGHT 
THEY'LL BE HOPING THAT SHEFFIELD 
WEDNESDAY GET BEAT 
LEICESTER HAVE 
STOKE AWAY IN THE LAST GAME OF THE 
SEASON THEY NEED TO PICK SOMETHING 
UP FOR SURE 
COUNT DOWN TO THE F. A.

FINALISTS CARDIFF CITY HAVE 
RELEASED THEIR F. A. CUP SONG

FOOTBALL SONGS IS THAT THE RIGHT 
NOTE NOTE PERFECT 
I REMEMBER DOING NOTE PERFECT OURS IN ARSENAL AND EVERYBODY 
THINKS IT'S A GOOD IDEA EXCEPT THE 
PLAYERS THEY LOOK LIKE IT'S FUN 
BUT I CAN'T SEE IT GETTING TO ONE 
THE CREDIT SIDE IS THAT THEY'RE 
PROBABLY RAISING MONEY FOR CHARITY 
AND THE DEBIT SIDE IS IS THAT IT'S 
MINGING 
IT'S NICE THAT THEY FILMED MINGING IT IN BLACK AND WHITE TO SEE IT'S 
ARTY 
WE HAVE A ALL DONE IT AND ARTY THEN OVER THE YEARS YOU THINK WHAT 
ON EARTH WAS I THINKING OF 
BY THE 
WAY IT'S CHELSEA ZERO MANCHESTER
