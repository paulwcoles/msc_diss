GROWING UP'S GOOD BECAUSE YOU GET MORE FRIENDLY WITH THE GIRLS 
COS THEY START TO TALK TO YOU 
I FEEL A BIT DIFFERENTLY AROUND BOYS 
WHEN I WAS IN PRIMARY I'D PLAY ABOUT WITH THEM EASILY 
NOW I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT THEM ESPECIALLY WHEN I FANCY THEM 
WHEN YOU FANCY SOMEONE YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOUR A LOT TO GET NOTICED 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO OUT WITH SOMEONE WHEN YOU FANCY THEM 
WHEN YOU THINK OF SOMEONE AS A BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND 
THIS IS A CHANGE THAT HAPPENS AT PUBERTY 
WHEN YOU FANCY SOMEONE YOUR HEART BEATS AND YOU'RE LIKE WOW 
WHEN YOU FANCY SOMEONE IT FEELS STRANGE COS YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO GO AND ASK THEM OR TALK TO THEM 
YOU WRITE ALL OVER YOUR FOLDER THAT YOU LOVE HIM AND ALL YOUR PALS ARE LIKE ASK HIM OUT 
YOU JUST CAN'T EXPLAIN IT IT'S LIKE EXCITEMENT OR FEAR 
YOU CAN HAVE VERY STRONG EMOTIONAL FEELINGS ABOUT A RANGE OF PEOPLE 
POP STARS TEACHERS FILM STARS PEOPLE OF THE SAME SEX AND PEOPLE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX 
A CRUSH ON A POP STAR ALL PEOPLE HAVE THAT 
EMMA FROM THE SPICE GIRLS WE SAW ROMEO AND JULIET SUDDENLY LEONARDO DI CAPRIO WAS EVERYTHING 
BRITNEY SPEARS AT THE MOMENT I REALLY LIKE HER I'VE GOT PICTURES 
EVERYONE HAS THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO CHANCE IT'S NORMAL 
WE MAY IMAGINE BEING MARRIED TO OUR FAVOURITE POP STAR BUT IT'S NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN 
WE TEND GO OUT WITH SOMEONE CLOSER TO HOME CLOSER TO OUR OWN AGE 
HOW DO THEY GET TOGETHER IT CAN BE DIFFICULT GETTING SOMEONE TO NOTICE OR GO OUT WITH YOU 
THERE ARE A WHOLE RANGE OF METHODS YOU CAN USE SOME ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN OTHERS 
YOU'RE PATHETIC 
THAT WAS VERY POPULAR WHEN I WAS AT PRIMARY 
DOES FLICKING THINGS AT PEOPLE ATTRACT THEIR ATTENTION 
IT'LL GET THE WRONG ATTENTION NOT THE RIGHT ATTENTION IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT WITH SOMEONE 
IF SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO GET MY ATTENTION BY FLICKING A PIECE OF PAPER 
I'D GET THE IMPRESSION THEY HATED ME 
THIS 
IS YOUR NAME JOHN WATSON MIGHT BE 
WELL MY MATE FANCIES YOU WILL YOU GO OUT WITH HER 
MIGHT DO 
SUIT YOURSELF 
MIGHT DO MIGHT DO GERROFF 
GERROFF 
HAS ANYONE EVER DONE THAT DOES IT WORK 
IT DOES WORK COS I'VE ASKED ONE OF MY MATES TO ASK A GIRL OUT AND A GIRL'S MATE'S ASKED ME OUT 
IT'S A PRETTY DECENT METHOD I THINK 
IT WORKED FOR ME I GOT MY FRIENDS TO ASK THIS BOY OUT AND HE SAID YES SO I WAS GOING OUT WITH HIM 
DO YOU THINK IF YOU WERE TO ASK THEM YOURSELF THEY MIGHT SAY NO 
OR ARE YOU SCARED THEY MIGHT SAY NO 
IT'S BETTER TO USE A FRIEND IF THEY SAY NO YOUR FRIEND CAN TELL YOU 
IT'S BETTER THAN HAVING IT IN FRONT OF YOU 
IT MIGHT BACKFIRE IF YOU GET YOUR FRIENDS TO ASK SOMEONE OUT AND THEY SAY NO 
EVERYONE'S GONNA KNOW THEY SAID NO SO YOU MIGHT FEEL A BIT HUMILIATED BY IT 
WHAT ABOUT THE FACT HE WAS ASKED IN FRONT OF HIS FRIEND I FEEL THAT 
HE FELT A BIT EMBARRASSED 
I WOULDN'T LIKE TO BE IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS WHILE SOMEONE WAS SENT TO TELL ME THAT SOMEONE LIKES ME 
LET'S SEE ANOTHER ONE 
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT 
WAITING FOR YOUR MATE YEAH 
CHELLE'S GETTING A TELLING OFF SHE FORGOT HER P. E. KIT AGAIN OH 
I LIKE P. E. ME TOO CHELLE'S HOPELESS SHE NEVER BRINGS IN HER P. E. KIT 
SHE'S COMING CHELLE OVER HERE WE'RE GONNA BE LATE 
YEAH SEE YA LATER 
DO YOU THINK THERE WAS PROGRESS THERE 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY THE BEST ONE WE'VE SEEN SO FAR 
IT BREAKS THE ICE AND HE MADE A START MAYBE FROM THERE A FRIENDSHIP OR RELATIONSHIP COULD DEVELOP 
HE'S MADE AN OPENING TO APPROACH HER AGAIN AND THEY BOTH LIKE P. E. 
NEXT TIME THEY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING ELSE OUT 
AND FINALLY 
ALL RIGHT FATTY 
SHUT IT MORON IF BRAINS WERE BRACES YOU'D HAVE TO WEAR A BELT I KNOW 
ERE YOU GOING TO SEE THAT NEW FILM I MIGHT BE WHAT'S IT TO YOU 
IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO INSULT PEOPLE IF YOU WANT THEM TO LIKE YOU THAT WAY WAS SAFE IT CAN'T BACKFIRE 
WHAT YOU SAY CAN BE TAKEN AS A JOKE 
IT CAN BE A BAD IDEA BEING NASTY 
COS IT COULD GIVE THE WRONG IMPRESSION THAT YOU WANT TO HURT THEM AND BE VIOLENT WITH THEM 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE VIOLENCE VERBAL OR PHYSICAL 
TO TALK TO SOMEONE HE COULD SPEAK NICELY 
SAYING HI I REALLY LIKE YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO THE CINEMA OR SOMETHING ALONG THAT LINE 
ONCE YOU'VE TALKED TO ONE BOY IT GETS EASIER 
I'LL TALK TO THEM TO GET A BIT CLOSE TO THEM AND FIND OUT IF THEY LIKE ME 
I'D TAKE HIM TO ONE SIDE I WOULDN'T DO IT IN FRONT OF ANYONE 
I'D SAY I'VE LIKED YOU A LONG TIME WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME 
I'D MAKE IT PERSONAL AND IT'S JUST YOU BY YOURSELF AND BE HONEST 
I'VE GOT A GIRLFRIEND AT THE MOMENT AND SOMEBODY ASKED HER OUT FOR ME 
THEN I HAD TO GO UP TO HER AGAIN AND ASK HER IT WASN'T THAT BAD 
THE BEST METHOD SEEMS TO BE TALKING TO SOMEONE AND BEING STRAIGHT 
WE'VE HAD A LETTER FROM SOMEONE WHO REALLY FANCIES A GIRL IN THEIR CLASS AND SHE'S NOT INTERESTED 
WHAT IF THE OTHER PERSON DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO 
GO ON TO SOMEONE ELSE 
THEY DON'T FANCY YOU HAS THAT HAPPENED TO ANY OF YOU YEAH 
IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS NOT EVERYONE'S READY TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP 
DON'T BE PRESSURISED BY FRIENDS AND FAMILY 
HAVEN'T YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND YET 
OH LOOK IT'S YOUR LITTLE GIRLFRIEND 
IF YOU ASK HIM OUT WE COULD GO AS A FOURSOME 
HAVEN'T YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND YET 
EE 
YOU MAKE A LOVELY COUPLE 
SOME PEOPLE THINK EVERYONE HAS TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND YOU'RE NOT NORMAL IF YOU DON'T 
YOU MIGHT END UP PRETENDING 
HELLO I GOT ANOTHER LETTER FROM JAMIE 
ANOTHER ONE HE MUST WRITE EVERY DAY IT MUST BE LOVE LET'S SEE 
WELL 
WHEN'S HE COMING TO SEE YOU I DON'T KNOW HE'S PHONING ME TONIGHT CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HIM 
I DON'T KNOW WHEN HE'LL GET HERE HE LIVES IN LONDON YOU'D BE BETTER WITH SOMEONE FROM HERE I'M HAPPY 
WHY DO PEOPLE GET THEMSELVES INTO THAT SITUATION IT'S SILLY 
PRETENDING YOU'VE GOT A BOYFRIEND IS JUST STUPID 
YOU MAY BE LONELY BUT THERE'S OTHER THINGS TO DO WITH YOUR FRIENDS THAN PRETEND YOU'VE GOT A BOYFRIEND 
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOUR FRIENDS FIND OUT YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO THEM 
YOU COULD END UP WITH NO FRIENDS SO THERE'S NO POINT IN DOING IT 
THERE IS NO RULE THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND 
YOUR GRANDPARENTS SAY YOU'RE VERY ATTRACTIVE I BET YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF BOYFRIENDS 
YOU THINK OH GOD NO 
MY NAN GOES HAVE YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND 
I DON'T REALLY WANT ONE YET COS I LIKE HAVING MY GIRLIE FRIENDS AROUND 
MY FRIENDS HAVE ALL GOT GIRLFRIENDS THEY GO DO YOU LIKE THIS GIRL 
I GO WHEN I WANT A GIRLFRIEND I'LL TELL YOU 
MY FRIENDS JUST PICK SOMEBODY THEY DON'T LOVE THEM OR ANYTHING IT'S JUST LIKE LET'S GET A GIRLFRIEND 
THEY SEE SOMEBODY ELSE THEN DUMP THAT GIRLFRIEND THAT'S NOT FAIR 
BUT AT SOME POINT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO WANT TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND OR A GIRLFRIEND WHAT MAKES A GOOD ONE 
IT'S SOMEBODY YOU CAN TALK TO IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO YOUR FRIENDS 
A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOUR GOOD LOOKS AND VERY KIND AND CARING 
A SENSE OF HUMOUR DOES MATTER 
SOMEONE WHO LIKES YOU NOT FOR YOUR CLOTHES BUT FOR WHO YOU ARE INSIDE 
NOBODY WHO MAKES FUN OF YOU AND IS HORRIBLE IN FRONT OF THEIR MATES 
AT THE BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND SHOP WHAT WOULD YOU WANT 
GOOD MORNING MISS CAN I HELP YOU YES I'M LOOKING FOR A BOYFRIEND YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE 
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR BLOND HAIR YOU'VE JUST MISSED A BLOND BUT I'VE GOT A NICE BROWN O. K. 
SOMETHING SPORTY AH HE LOVES DARTS WHAT ABOUT A FOOTBALLER 
THEY'RE VERY POPULAR HOW ABOUT A DARTS PLAYER H. M. M. BLUE EYES 
HAZEL FLAT STOMACH 
NEEDS A BIT OF WORK INTELLIGENT YES 
NO BUT HE CAN BELCH THE NATIONAL ANTHEM FIT 
ABSOLUTELY NOT REALLY 
I'M NOT HAVING MUCH LUCK THERE'S A DANCE ON FRIDAY YOU'VE LEFT IT LATE I KNOW 
COULD I SEE HIM ABSOLUTELY THERE 
BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSERS I SUPPOSE HE'LL DO EXCELLENT SHALL I WRAP HIM FOR YOU YOU'D BETTER 
WILL SHE ENJOY BEING WITH THAT BOYFRIEND RUBY NO 
HE'S GOT NONE OF THE QUALITIES SHE WANTED SHE'S SETTLING FOR LESS THAN HER IDEAL 
THE PROBLEM HERE WAS ALL THE QUESTIONS SHE ASKED WERE ABOUT LOOKS 
AND HOW SHE MIGHT WANT TO IMPRESS SOMEONE WITH A BOYFRIEND 
HE MIGHT HAVE A GOOD PERSONALITY SHE SHOULD'VE ASKED IS HE FUNNY 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES RELATIONSHIPS WORK 
OH HELLO AGAIN DEAR HELLO I'M NOT COMPLAINING BUT THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE SAY NO MORE 
BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT WELL IF I TELL YOU WHAT I WANT PERHAPS IT'D BE MORE SUITABLE UH HUH 
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR BLOND HAIR BLUE EYES FIT GOOD DANCER 
UH HUH WHAT ABOUT MIKE HE'S NOT BLOND BUT HE'S GOT BLUE EYES HE'S OLDER THAN YOU BUT INTELLIGENT 
DRESSES SMART BUT CASUAL ONLY SWEARS WHEN HE'S IN PAIN QUITE FIT BUT NOT EXACTLY A BODY BUILDER 
SOUNDS GOOD COULD I SEE HIM HE'S SECOND FROM THE LEFT VERY NICE EXCELLENT 
SHALL I WRAP HIM FOR YOU NO I'LL TAKE HIM AS HE IS THANKS 
SHOULD SHE HAVE TURNED HIM DOWN COS HE WASN'T EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED 
SHE'LL NEVER GET EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS 
THAT GUY WAS INTERESTING AND NICE AND HAD SOME OF THE QUALITIES SHE WANTED SHE'LL PROBABLY GET ON WITH HIM 
IS THIS SITUATION REALISTIC YEAH 
HOW SHOULD YOU BEHAVE WITH A BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND YOU'VE GOT TO SUPPORT AND COMFORT EACH OTHER 
AND BE ABLE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER OPEN YOURSELF TO EACH OTHER NOT KEEP EVERYTHING INSIDE 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ALL CLINGY 
YOU CAN STILL BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS 
GENERALLY TREATING THEM AS WELL AS YOU CAN RESPECT IS A HUGE POINT IN A RELATIONSHIP 
WHEN YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND OR A GIRLFRIEND THERE ARE UNSPOKEN RULES YOU FOLLOW LIKE MUTUAL RESPECT 
YOU DON'T INSULT THEM BEHIND THEIR BACK OR TO THEIR FACE 
YOU DON'T TELL THEIR SECRETS TO EVERYONE BECAUSE THEY'RE SECRETS THEY'VE TOLD IN CONFIDENCE 
YOU'RE ENTITLED TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP IF YOU DON'T IT'S NOT WORKING 
SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT ANYONE BREAKING RULES HERE 
SHE STUFFS TISSUES DOWN HER BRA 
NO SHE DOES 
DON'T TELL ANYONE ELSE I TOLD YOU SO HOW DO YOU KNOW 
A BIT FELL OUT WHEN WE WERE DOING P. E. 
ARE YOU WATCHING US PLAY ON SUNDAY I CAN'T STAND FOOTBALL 
WELL JUST WATCH ME NO I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO THE BOWLING NO I PLAY ON SUNDAY MORNING 
BOWLING'S KACK FUNNY HOW EVERYTHING YOU'RE RUBBISH AT'S KACK I'M NOT RUBBISH YOU CAN'T BEAT ME 
COS IT'S A LASSIES' GAME YOU CAN'T BEAT ME AT FOOTBALL ONLY ON THE PLAYSTATION THAT WAS A PURE FLUKE 
WE COULD GO TO MY BIT AND LISTEN TO MY C. D.'S I'LL BRING SOME OF MINE 
YOURS ARE ALL GUFF NOT LIKE THE JESSIES YOU LISTEN TO I BET THEY DON'T WRITE THEIR OWN SONGS 
THEY DON'T THEIR OWN SONGS THEY GET UGLY GADGES TO SING THEM AND PUT PRETTY BOYS ON THE VIDEO 
AT LEAST YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE SINGING 
MAYBE HE'S NOT THE RIGHT GUY FOR YOU HE'S A TUBE RIGHT ENOUGH 
NOT BAD LOOKING BUT NO BUT HE'S STUPID HE THINKS EASTENDERS IS A DOCUMENTARY 
NOT MANY ARE MUCH IN THE BRAINS DEPARTMENT 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT HALF THE TIME MAYBE I WANT A BOYFRIEND WHO LIKES TO BE WITH ME 
WANTS TO DO THE SAME THINGS I DO WHAT ICE SKATING NO CHANCE 
I'VE SEEN KEVIN HARROWER AT THE SKATING A FEW TIMES HE'S GOOD AT IT TOO AND HE'S IN MY ART CLASS 
KEVIN HARROWER HE HE'S NICE 
HE ALWAYS TALKS TO ME ABOUT STUFF 
HE'S TOO OLD FOR YOU ANYWAY WHAT ABOUT ME WHAT ABOUT YOU 
IF YOU THINK KEVIN HARROWER FANCIES YOU YOU'RE DAFTER THAN YOU LOOK SO I LOOK DAFT YOU WILL WAIT AND SEE 
WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT THOSE SKETCHES ANY RULES BEING BROKEN 
THE FIRST ONE I SAW WAS SECRETS BEING TOLD BEHIND BACKS 
I THINK THAT'S VERY WRONG IT AIN'T NICE 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER'S INTERESTS 
THERE WERE A LOT OF INSULTS THEY WERE QUITE NASTY TO EACH OTHER 
ONE OF THE GIRLS WAS GOING ON ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE SHE LIKED TO HER BOYFRIEND 
SHE WAS TRYING TO MAKE HER BOYFRIEND JEALOUS 
TO HER SO IT'S NOT GOOD 
AT THE END OF THE DAY DO YOU REALLY LIKE THIS PERSON OR ARE THEY JUST SOMEONE TO GO OUT WITH 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND 
IT'S ONLY RIGHT WHEN IT'S SOMETHING YOU WANT TO DO NOT SOMETHING YOUR FRIENDS WANT 
WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT THEM DO YOU ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH THEM 
IT'S A TWO WAY THING WHAT DO THEY EXPECT AND HOW CAN YOU BE A GOOD BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND 
DON'T HANG AROUND WITH YOUR FRIENDS ALL THE TIME AND PLAY FOOTBALL 
SPEAK TO THEM KEEP THEM COMPANY 
BE KIND GENEROUS 
JUST BE YOURSELF DON'T TRY TO BE SOMEBODY YOU'RE NOT
