HE'S TAKEN THE SECOND 
TRAFFIC COPS OUT IN FORCE 
CHASING CAR THIEVES 
COME OUT COME OUT 
IT'S NOT A STOLEN CAR 
CHASING DRUG DEALERS 
BEAR IN MIND IT'S DRUGS RELATED 
POSSESSION WITH INTENT TO SUPPLY AS WELL ALL RIGHT 
CHASING THE DRAGON 
IT'S LIKE A FIRE BREATHING DRAGON 
START TELLING THE TRUTH 
EVERYTHING YOU'VE SAID SO FAR YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO US IT'S LIKE FISHING ISN'T IT 
SOMETIMES THE FISH ARE OUT THERE OTHER DAYS THEY ARE NOT BITING 
FORTUNATELY GRIMSBY'S GOOD FOR FISH 
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE THIN BLUE LINE IS GETTING THINNER AND THINNER 
POLICE OFFICERS ARE SEEN LESS AND LESS THESE DAYS 
THEY'RE TOO BUSY TO GET OUT 
NOW THOUGH THE COPS IN YORKSHIRE ARE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
THEY'VE COME UP WITH AN OPERATION WHERE COMBINED MANPOWER FROM NORTH SOUTH AND WEST YORKSHIRE 
AND NEIGHBOURING HUMBERSIDE 
ALL HIT THE STREETS OF ONE PLACE TOGETHER IN AN ALL OUT SHOW OF FORCE 
YOU WE HAVE ARRESTED SOMEBODY ACROSS THE REGION ONCE EVERY SIX MINUTES 
WHICH IS ENOUGH TO FILL DONCASTER PRISON SEVEN TIMES OVER 
TODAY IT'S HULL AND GRIMSBY'S TURN FOR A QUICK FIX 
MANY THINGS DON'T STRIKE FEAR INTO CRIMINALS' HEARTS 
BUT I'M SURE SEEING ALL YOU LOT OUT ON THE ROADS TODAY WILL DO THAT 
IF YOU TAKE OFFICERS FROM FOUR FORCES AND PUT THEM INTO 
ONE AREA FOR THE DAY THERE'S A GREAT CHANCE YOU'LL GET SOME SUCCESS 
THE LARGEST CONTINGENT IN GRIMSBY TO PLAY ARE FROM SOUTH YORKSHIRE 
SOMEONE DESCRIBED US AS BEING CHILDREN IN A NEW PLAYGROUND 
WE'RE IN A NEW AREA AND EVERYBODY HAD 
A LITTLE BIT OF SPIRIT AND THOUGHT LET'S GO AND POLICE GRIMSBY HARD 
WE'RE OUT TARGETING CRIMINALS THAT ARE USING THE ROADS 
ALL AVAILABLE TRAFFIC COPS HAVE BEEN MOBILISED TODAY 
EVEN THE BOSSES 
THEY'RE COMING IN THICK AND FAST I THINK THERE'S BEEN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT NO INSURANCES 
WE'RE GONNA BE BUSY 
I'D COME ACROSS FOR THAT PARTICULAR DAY 
SORT OF LIAISON FOR OPERATION IMPACT 
SHE WAS SHORT OF A DRIVER SO I GOT DRAFTED IN HENCE I WAS WEARING THE BIKE GEAR WHILE DRIVING A CAR 
THE NERVE CENTRE FOR THE OPERATION IS THE CONTROL ROOM 
WHERE THEY'RE DIRECTING THE HUNT FOR A CAR STOLEN EARLIER IN THE DAY 
A LAGUNA WAS CIRCULATED AND WE WERE TOLD AT THE BRIEFING THAT IT HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM TESCO THAT MORNING 
SO WE WERE ALL LOOKING OUT FOR THAT ONE 
INCLUDING THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE BOYS IN THEIR UNMARKED VOLVO 
WHO HAVE A REPUTATION TO LIVE UP TO AS TOP THIEF CATCHERS 
THIS IS WHERE THIS LAGUNA'S GONNA BE INNIT YEP 
WHERE WERE IT NICKED FROM CLEETHORPES FROM TESCO 
THAT WAS ONE THAT WAS TOP OF OUR LIST TO SEE IF WE COULD FIND THAT VEHICLE 
THIS IS MORE LIKE IT THIS 
BIG ESTATES 
WE KNEW WHAT PROBLEMS GRIMSBY HAS VERY SIMILAR TO CERTAIN AREAS OF SHEFFIELD 
DRUGS CAR CRIME BURGLARIES 
SO WE PRETTY MUCH HAD AN IDEA WHAT TYPE OF AREA WE WERE MOVING INTO 
IS THAT ROW OF SHOPS LIKE OUR MANOR PARK CENTRE ONE CONVULGES BACK DOWN THERE 
CONVULGES IS THAT A WORD CONVULGE CONVERGE CONVERGE DID I SAY CONVULGE 
YEAH I DID 
I QUITE LIKE BUILDING UP AN INTELLIGENCE OF AN AREA KNOWING ME AREA KNOWING THE CRIMINALS KNOWING 
THEIR ACTIONS THE ROUTES THAT THEY TAKE 
YOU GET TO A NEW AREA LIKE THAT AND YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH WORKING BLIND WHICH IS HARD WORK 
IT MAY BE HARD WORK BUT THEY HAVE WELL SEASONED NOSES FOR LAWBREAKERS TO HELP THEM 
BOTH ME AND TIM HAVE GOT QUITE A LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE JOB 
AND YOU LEARN AS TIME GOES 
ON WHO TO LOOK AT THE TYPE OF PEOPLE YOU'RE LOOKING AT 
HOW THEY LOOK AT YOU AND ALSO THE TYPE OF VEHICLES THEY USE 
THIS OLD VAUXHALL SMELLS LIKE THE RIGHT KIND OF VEHICLE 
THAT VECTRA LOOKS WORTH A LOOK 
OLD ONE YEAH HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE HAD AN ORANGE FLASHING LIGHT 
ON THE TOP AND A BIG SIGN ON THE BACK SAYING THE STOP ME 
THE DRIVER WASN'T WEARING A SEATBELT 
IT'S NOVEMBER FIFTH EIGHT FOUR 
VICTOR PAPA ALPHA BLUE VECTRA 
SEATBELT'S ON NOW 
CONFIRMING A BLUE VECTRA THE PREVIOUS KEEPER DETAILS ARE IPSWICH 
PREVIOUS 
INSURANCE 
DOES ANY INSURANCE SEARCH SHOW ON THAT PLEASE 
THAT'S A NEGATIVE 
SAYS IT'S MARKED AS IN TRADE 
TREMENDOUS ROGER THANK YOU 
WE SOON REALISED ALL WAS NOT RIGHT WITH THE VEHICLE 
IT WAS SHOWING IN TRADE WHICH MEANS THE VEHICLE'S NOT OWNED BY ANYBODY AND NOT REGISTERED TO ANYBODY 
IT WAS SHOWING NO INSURANCE IT WAS SHOWING 
ALL THE MARKERS THAT SUGGEST THAT THE PERSON IS DRIVING IT WITHOUT ANY FORM OF DOCUMENTATION 
FLASHING BLUE LIGHTS FROM BEHIND CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING 
STILL THINKING ABOUT IT 
EVEN IF THEY ARE ON AN UNMARKED VOLVO 
IT'S TIME TO PULL OVER 
INITIALLY WE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO FAIL TO STOP FOR US 
WE PUT THE BLUE LIGHTS INDICATING WE WANTED HIM TO STOP 
HE'D SEEN US YOU COULD SEE THAT HE'D SEEN US AND HE JUST TOOK A LONG LONG TIME TO STOP 
IT WAS RUNNING THROUGH HIS MIND WHETHER HE COULD FAIL TO STOP AND GET AWAY OR NOT 
HE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE 
IF THE POLICE WANT YOU TO STOP THEN YOU SHOULD STOP 
THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS IS WE THINK YOU DON'T WANT TO STOP FOR US 
THAT'S WHY I INDICATED SOMETIMES WE GET PEOPLE GIEING US RODS AS WELL IS THIS YOUR CAR 
I BORROWED IT DOES HE KNOW YOU BORROWED IT ARE YOU SURE ARE YOU SURE 
IS IT YOUR CAR 
YEAH IT'S JUST 
WHOSE CAR IS IT 
THIS IS LIKE A CAR THAT I'M BUYING BUT I HAVEN'T BOUGHT THE CAR 
SO I'M BUYING THE CAR BUT JUST TAKING THE CAR OUT BUT THE OWNER KNOWS YOU'VE GOT IT 
YEAH I'M NOT THE LEGAL OWNER BUT 
BUT YOU'VE GOT AUTHORITY TO DRIVE IT YEAH I AM GOING TO BE THE LEGAL OWNER 
HAVE A SEAT IN THE BACK OF MY CAR COME THIS WAY 
HE WAS VERY VAGUE ON WHO ACTUALLY OWNED THE CAR HE DIDN'T OWN IT 
HE STRAIGHT AWAY ADMITTED NO INSURANCE ON THE CAR 
ARE YOU KNOWN TO THE POLICE MARK 
YEAH DRIVING OFFENCES WHAT 
DRIVING OFFENCES DRIVING OFFENCES 
HAVE YOU GOT A FULL LICENCE NO O. K. 
I DIDN'T HAVE TO ASK HIM MANY QUESTIONS TO FIND THAT HE'D GOT NO LICENCE EITHER 
THIS VECTRA THAT FINALLY GOT STOPPED COULD I HAVE A PHOENIX PERSON AND D. L. ON THE DRIVER PLEASE 
THESE COPS FROM SOUTH YORKSHIRE ARE PART OF A CRACK CAR CRIME BUSTING UNIT 
BUT SERGEANT HOUGHTON STILL WORRIES ABOUT BALDNESS

THE CODE'S EXPOSED ALL THE WAY ROUND 
LOOK AT THE HOLE IN THAT TYRE 
HAVE YOU SEEN THE TYRES ON IT 
WHAT ABOUT THE TYRE 
THREE LIKE THAT 
WATCH YOURSELF YOU'LL CUT YOUR FINGER 
SOMEBODY WHO'S DRIVING A CAR WITH THREE DEFECTIVE TYRES 
THAT SHOWS NO REGARD TO ANYBODY 
THAT'S THE MENTALITY OF SOME OF THESE PEOPLE THAT USE THE ROAD 
TODAY'S OPERATION REACHES ALL THE WAY TO NEARBY CLEETHORPES A TRADITIONAL ENGLISH SEASIDE RESORT 
TIDE'S OUT THEN TIDE'S WELL OUT 
WHERE THERE'S STILL A PLACE FOR OLD FASHIONED COPPERING SKILLS 
LIKE PICKING ON DRIVERS OF VAUXHALLS

TRAFFIC MAN'S SIXTH SENSE

BUT HE TOLD ME HE'S GOT INSURANCE THAT'S WHY I DRIVE IT 
WELL WE'VE DONE A CHECK ON IT SAYING IT HASN'T GOT ANY INSURANCE

YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SHOPPING OUT OF THE CAR 
HERE HERE 
THE MAN'S NOT BOTHERED ABOUT LOSING THE CAR ONLY HOW HE'S GOING

IS THIS YOU HE'S BUY THIS ONE 
IS THAT YOU ON THERE THAT'S YOUR NAME 
YEAH YEAH THAT'S MINE 
THE MAN'S NAME ON HIS I. D. CARD IS KARIMI THE SAME NAME AS THE REGISTERED OWNER OF THE CAR 
YES WE'VE ESTABLISHED WE'VE BEEN GIVEN DUFF DETAILS BY THIS GENTLEMAN 
CAN I CHECK A SECOND SET OF DETAILS WITH YOU FROM A HOME OFFICE I. D. CARD 
I BELIEVE IT MIGHT LINK IN WITH THE P. N. C. KEEPER IF YOU CAN CHECK FOR ME AGAIN 
I DON'T WANT YOUR FRIEND'S NAME I WANTED YOUR NAME YOU WANTED MY NAME YES THE CAR IS MY FRIEND'S 
YEAH BUT YOU'RE DRIVING IT 
YOU'RE DRIVING COME STAND HERE COME STAND OVER HERE 
IT'S JUST NOT WHAT THEY SAY IT'S HOW THEY SAY IT 
IT'S THEIR NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION IT'S JUST HOW THEY ARE 
I HATE TO USE THE WORD SHIFTY 
BUT I JUST GOT THIS HORRIBLE FEELING ABOUT HIM HE'S JUST NOT TELLING ME THE TRUTH 
IN GRIMSBY THE DRIVER WITH THE BALD TYRES DID GIVE HIS TRUE NAME 
THE CHECK ON IT HAS COME BACK THAT HE'S A DRUG DEALER STEVE 
A SEARCH OF HIS CAR IS IMPERATIVE 
INTELLIGENCE ON CLASS C. SUPPLYING STOLEN GOODS 
WHAT WE JUST NEED TO GO THROUGH THE VEHICLE 
IT'S GOT THREE ILLEGAL TYRES ON IT 
THE FRONT TYRE IS JUST CORDS ALONE THERE'S NO RUBBER ON IT 
HE'S SUCH A TRAFFIC COP ISN'T HE 
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS IN A ROAD CRIME TEAM YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING 
AT BURGLARS AND DRUG DEALERS AND CAR THIEVES AND HE'S MORE INTERESTED IN THE TYRE 
WE HAVE THE GROUNDS TO GIVE YOU A QUICK SEARCH SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO 
WE KNEW FROM HIS PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS THAT HE WAS INVOLVED IN SUPPLYING OF CANNABIS AND OTHER DRUGS 
THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR US TO GO BACK TO THE VEHICLE AND HAVE A SECOND LOOK AT IT AND SEARCH 
THROUGH IT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY SUBSTANCES ON BOARD THAT VEHICLE 
SURE ENOUGH THERE IS 
WE SEARCHED THE VEHICLE AND WE FOUND SOME CANNABIS RESIN 
IN A LARGE POLYTHENE BAG BUT ALL SEPARATELY WRAPPED UP IN WHAT WE CALLED DEALER WRAPS 
ALL WEIGHED AND ALL MEASURED READY TO SELL ON 
I'M JUST GONNA CUFF YOU JUST IN CASE 
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR POSSESSION OF CLASS C. WITH INTENT TO SUPPLY 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING WHICH MAY HARM YOUR DEFENCE 
WHEN QUESTIONED SOMETHING WHICH YOU MAY LATER RELY ON IN COURT ANYTHING YOU DO SAY MAY BE GIVEN IN EVIDENCE 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 
YEAH CAN I HAVE A VAN PLEASE TO LACEBY ROAD THAT'S THE A FORTY SIX LACEBY ROAD 
TWO UNDER ARREST WITH INTENT TO SUPPLY 
ROGER STAND BY I DIDN'T THINK WE'D BE THIS THICK AND FAST 
I KNEW IT WOULD BE BUSY BUT 
IT'S ONE UP TO THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE BOYS 
WE OUGHT TO HAVE HAD A BIT OF A SWEEPSTAKE TO SEE WHO GOT FIRST PRISONERS DIDN'T WE 
WHILE YOUR LOT ARE FANNYING ABOUT WE'VE STRUCK 
IT'S A STANDARD STOPCHECK NO LICENCE AND NO INSURANCE 
WE'VE GONE INTO THE CENTRE CONSOLE AND FOUND SIX MAJOR WRAPS OF CANNABIS RESIN 
BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN LOCAL PROCEDURES PROCESS TEAMS HAVE BEEN SET UP FOR THE DAY 
ANYBODY THAT WERE ARRESTED WERE TO BE HANDED OVER TO 
LOCAL PROCESS TEAMS WHO WOULD THEN CARRY IT 
ON FROM THERE PUT THE FILE TOGETHER AND THEN WE WOULD BE LEFT TO GO BACK 
OUT ON THE STREETS AND CONTINUE DOING WHAT I THINK WE DO BEST 
YOU TAKE CARE 
IN CLEETHORPES HUMBERSIDE ARE ABOUT TO STRIKE BACK 
TELL ME WHEN YOUR BIRTHDAY IS 
HE'S BEEN TELLING US PORKIES 
AT THE START HE SAID I'M NOT THE OWNER OF THE CAR HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WASN'T INSURED 
ACTUALLY HE IS THE OWNER OF THE CAR SO HE KNOWS VERY WELL THAT IT'S NOT INSURED 
WE'VE MANAGED TO ESTABLISHED WHO HE IS AND THAT HE IS AT THAT ADDRESS BUT HE'S NOT WANTED 
HE'S THE OWNER OF THE CAR 
SPOOKY HE DOES KNOW IT'S NOT INSURED 
THE CAR IS REGISTERED TO YOU TO ME TO YOU YOU SAID IT'S YOUR FRIEND'S BUT IT'S REGISTERED IN YOUR NAME 
YESTERDAY I BUY IT BUT HE SAYS HE'S GOT FULL INSURANCE LISTEN YOU'VE BEEN HERE THREE YEARS 
YES YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO BE REPORTED FOR DRIVING OTHER THAN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DRIVING LICENCE 
YOU NEED ANOTHER DRIVING LICENCE YOU DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE A TEST IN THIS COUNTRY WHAT 
THIS COUNTRY AFTER A YEAR BEING A RESIDENT IN THIS COUNTRY 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT'S THAT 
THIS IS YOUR INTERNATIONAL DRIVING LICENCE THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE WITH YOU 
I ASKED YOU IF YOU HAD THIS YOU SAID NO 
YOU SAID TO ASK ME FOR MY FRIEND'S DRIVING LICENCE 
HOW CAN I GO FOR MY FRIEND'S DRIVING LICENCE 
I TELL YOU WHAT START TELLING THE TRUTH COS EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE SAID SO FAR YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO US 
WE DO FIND OUT WE AREN'T DAFT ALL RIGHT YEAH O. K. JUST TELL US THE TRUTH 
YOU JUST ASKED ME FOR MY FRIENDS NO SHE DIDN'T I WAS STOOD NEXT TO HER 
SHE ASKED YOU IF YOU HAD A DRIVING LICENCE 
YOU TOLD HER YOU HAD AN INTERNATIONAL DRIVING LICENCE 
SHE ASKED YOU WHERE IT WAS AND YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT IT'S LIKE YOU WERE THE OWNER OF THE CAR 
IT'S LIKE YOU GAVE US DUFF DETAILS 
BE VERY CAREFUL YOU COULD BE IN CUSTODY NOW 
YEAH NOW WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO 
NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE CAR OFF YOU 
TAKE THE CAR OFF ME YES WHAT ABOUT THAT 
YOU CAN TAKE THE SHOPPING 
YOU CAN CALL A TAXI YOU CAN GET ON THE BUS 
HANG ON A SECOND 
THE CAR WAS PROBABLY WORTH TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED QUID 
TO INSURE IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE THAN THAT SO THEY'LL RUN THE RISK 
THEY LOSE IT THEY'LL BUY ANOTHER ONE 
REAL FRIEND'S OF KARIMI'S HAVE TURNED UP TO HELP HIM WITH HIS SHOPPING 
MORE OF THE COMBINED FORCES IN TODAY'S BIG OPERATION ARE ACROSS THE RIVER 
PREPARING FOR THE BLITZ ON HULL 
THERE'S INFORMATION COMING THROUGH FROM THE COMMAND CENTRE 
OF A STOLEN CAR IN THE AREA BEING DRIVEN BY A KNOWN SUSPECT 
IT'S IN RELATION TO A WHITE HONDA CIVIC 
STOLEN FROM A DELIVERY DRIVER 
THE SUSPECT INVOLVED IS A FRIEND 
OF P. C. ANDY STAINTON'S 
I BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLY IN POSSESSION OF A JASON ASLAM GIBSON DO YOU KNOW HIM 
OH YES I KNOW MR. GIBSON 
THE POSSIBLE SUSPECT DRIVING THE VEHICLE WAS GIBSON JASON ASLAM 
I HAVE HAD DEALINGS WITH HIM BEFORE 
CONFIDENT THEY'LL FIND HIM THE CALL'S GONE OUT FOR THE POLICE HELICOPTER 
BECAUSE GIBSON'S NOT ONLY A WELL KNOWN CAR THIEF HE'S ALSO A WELL KNOWN RUNNER 
FROM GETTING A CALL WE CAN BE AIRBORNE WITHIN TWO MINUTES 
THEN IT DEPENDS ON THE WIND 
HOW QUICK WE GET THERE 
HUMBERSIDE COPPER'S CHOPPER IS A FOUR MILLION M. D. NINE OH TWO EXPLORER 
NICE AIRCRAFT 
SPORTING A UNIQUE FEATURE 
NO TAIL ROTOR ALTHOUGH PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BELIEVE IT IT'S A LOT QUIETER 
WE CAN RESPOND JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTY WITHIN EIGHT OR NINE MINUTES 
ONE OF THE SUBARU TEAMS HAS SPOTTED MR. GIBSON IN THE STOLEN HONDA CIVIC 
TIME TO BURN SOME RUBBER 
THE OTHER CREW PICKED IT UP 
WE WERE NEARBY SO WE MADE OUR WAY TO HELP AND CONCENTRATE ON THE SURROUND OF THE AREA 
THERE HE IS 
THE CAR'S BEEN ABANDONED AND ONE PERSON'S BEEN CAUGHT BUT ANOTHER IS OUT AND RUNNING 
THERE'S A RUNNER BACK TOWARDS THE LANE 
WEARING A BLUE AND WHITE TOP 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SPRINT WITH ALL THAT GEAR ON 
HE HASN'T COME THIS WAY PROBABLY GONE THAT WAY 
EVEN IN RUNNING GEAR GIBSON WOULD BE HARD TO CATCH 
LUCKILY THE WIND'S IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND OSCAR NINETY NINE THE HELICOPTER IS HERE 
THE OFFICERS ON THE GROUND WERE QUICK TO CONTAIN THE AREA 
AND AS THE AIRCRAFT CAME OVERHEAD WE WERE ASKED TO DO A SEARCH OF THE AREA AND SEE IF WE COULD LOCATE ANYBODY 
WE'VE GOT THE HONDA SMV ROUND THE BACK OF BEVERLEY ROAD 
GIBSON DITCHED THE STOLEN CAR OR SMV ALONG WITH A GIRLFRIEND 
WHO CLAIMS SHE WAS AN INNOCENT PASSENGER 
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO HIDE THERE'S KEYS IN THE CAR I THOUGHT THE CAR WAS LEGAL 
THEY JUST OFFERED ME A LIFT SO OBVIOUSLY I SAID YES BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO SIGN ON AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY 
I'VE GOT A JOB INTERVIEW SHE WAS GIRL IN HER TEENS' 
HAVING BEEN THROWN AROUND THE STREETS AT FIFTY OR SIXTY M. P. H. 
IN THE AFTERNOON IS NOT GONNA BE VERY PLEASANT FOR HER 
REGARDLESS OF THAT SHE WAS IN A STOLEN VEHICLE AND HAS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 
WHICH IS WHY SHE WAS ARRESTED 
THE AREA ON THE GROUND HAS BEEN SEALED OFF GIBSON'S GOING TO BE FOUND BY HEAT SEEKING CAMERA 
HE'S RAN NORTH BASICALLY PARALLEL TO BEVERLEY ROAD 
BUT WITHIN THE ESTATE AREA 
THE THERMAL IMAGE CAMERA IS A VERY GOOD TOOL 
IT'S WORKING ON HEAT SIGNATURES THERMAL REFLECTION 
P. C. BENNETT HAS A TRICK OF THE TRADE FOR SITUATIONS LIKE THIS 
IF YOU SEE BIRDS STARTING TO FLY AWAY THEN WE'LL ZOOM IN AND HAVE 
A CLOSE LOOK BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE SLIGHTEST THING 
THAT MIGHT GIVE THEM AWAY 
THE BIRDS HAVE GIVEN THE GAME AWAY 
BENNETT SPOTTED A POSSIBLE HEAT SOURCE IN THE DENSE FOLIAGE 
THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IN THE BUSHES' 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE FRUSTRATING WHEN SOMEBODY'S HIDING IN BUSHES JUST ABOUT TEN FEET AWAY FROM OFFICERS 
ON THE GROUND BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE THE BUSHES ARE SO DEEP 
YOU WOULDN'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD BE IN IT 
IF YOU LOOK OVER THE BONNET OF THE SUBARU THAT'S NEXT TO THE CIVIC THERE'S A GAP IN THE GREEN FENCE 
IF YOU GO THROUGH THAT GAP IT'S JUST ALONG THE SHRUBLAND 
THE WALL ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE 
IF YOU GO TO THE END OF THE WALL AND TURN ROUND THE CORNER 
AS SOON AS I HEARD THEM SAY HE'S IN SOME BUSHES TO THE REAR OF THE RED BRICK BUILDING 
I WAS FAIRLY HAPPY THAT THE HEAT SOURCE THEY'D PICKED UP WAS GONNA BE OUR MAN 
THE BIRD IN THE BUSH 
IS ABOUT TO BE A BIRD IN THE HAND 
COME OUT COME OUT 
COME STRAIGHT THROUGH THIS HEDGE HERE TOWARDS ME STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HEDGE JASON 
AS SOON AS YOU GET TO THE HEDGE PUT YOUR ARMS OUT 
O. K. TO THE FLOOR TO THE FLOOR 
GET DOWN GOOD LAD 
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST ON SUSPICION OF TWOC 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND GET UP 
GIBSON WAS A SITTING DUCK WITH THE INFRARED CAMERA OVERHEAD 
BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK OUT SO WELL 
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE GET IT WRONG AND I HAVE SENT OFFICERS INTO MATING HEDGEHOGS TWICE 
WE'VE ALSO SENT OFFICERS INTO SLEEPING DOGS ON OCCASIONS 
TO WHICH WE KNOW WE HAVE TO APOLOGISE QUITE PROFUSELY 
OSCAR NINETY NINE ONE IN CUSTODY TRANSPORT THREE HUNDRED THREE PLEASE 
HAVE YOU ANYTHING ON YOU YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE NO GONNA CHECK YOUR POCKETS O. K. 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT NEEDLES OR ANYTHING NO 
IT COULD'VE BEEN A DOG CAT BUT WHERE I WAS STOOD AND WHAT I COULD SEE I WAS HAPPY IT WAS GOING TO BE HIM 
JASON GIBSON THE ONE WHO WAS GIVEN AS A SUSPECT 
JUST GONNA GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP US IN RESPECT OF RECOVERING THE CAR 
IF YOU'VE GOT THE KEY WE CAN HAVE THE KEY FROM YOU 
WE CAN RECOVER THE CAR PROPERLY AND THE OWNER CAN GET IT BACK BUT YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE KEY NO 
GIBSON KNOWS NOTHING HOW COULD IT HAVE BEEN HIM 
IF YOU'RE NOT INVOLVED WITH THE INCIDENT WHY ARE YOU HIDDEN IN A HEDGE 
HE WAS ARRESTED FOR AGGRAVATED VEHICLE TAKING GIVING THE FACT THAT THE VEHICLE WAS DAMAGED 
THAT MAKES IT AGGRAVATED VEHICLE TAKING 
WHICH IS ONE STEP ABOVE THE NORMAL TAKING WITHOUT OWNER'S CONSENT 
NICE SOCKS KIDDO YEAH NICE AREN'T THEY 
VERY PINK SIT YOURSELF IN 
YES FIFTY NINE RECEIVED THANKS FOR YOUR HELP OVER 
ROGER IF THERE'S NOTHING FURTHER FOR US I'LL GET SOME FUEL OVER 
SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF THE PRISONERS WE GET ARE NORMALLY THE ONES THAT WOULD HAVE GOT AWAY 
IN GRIMSBY THE OPERATION TO CLAMP DOWN ON CRIMINALS USING THE ROADS IS STILL IN FULL SWING 
DOES YOUR MAN KNOW WHERE SUTCLIFFE AVENUE IS 
JUST WANT TO CHECK ON THIS ASTRA 
ASTRA 
NOBODY'S GETTING AWAY NOT EVEN PASSENGERS WHO ARE NOT WEARING SEATBELTS 
IT SOUNDS A BIT PETTY TO SOME PEOPLE 
BUT AS WE PROVED WITH THE VECTRA INCIDENT 
SEATBELTS LEAD TO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS 
NAH HE'S GIVE HIMSELF UP 
THE DRIVER THE E. T. CHECKED OUT 
HE WAS LICENCED AND HAD INSURANCE FOR THE CAR THE PASSENGER WE WASN'T SO SURE ON 
WHERE DOES YOUR MUM LIVE PASSED AWAY 
RIGHT DAD PASSED AWAY 
AUNTY UNCLE SISTER BROTHER I HAVE AN AUNTY YEAH 
SO WHERE ARE YOU SLEEPING TONIGHT OH I DUNNO MIGHT STAY AT MY AUNTY'S AGAIN I SUPPOSE 
RIGHT COME AND SIT IN MY CAR FOR TWO MINUTES 
THE COPS WANT TO GIVE THE MAN A TICKET A THIRTY FINE BUT TO DO THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN ADDRESS 
HE INITIALLY SAID HE WAS NO FIXED ABODE 
WHICH IS THE OLD TRY ON OF YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH ME COS YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO COME AND FIND ME 
IF YOU SAY YOU'RE NO FIXED ABODE THE WAY FORWARD IS YOU GET ARRESTED 
AND PUT BEFORE A COURT AND THE COURT WILL FINE YOU 
NO FIXED ABODE THIS KID 
NO FIXED ABODE I'LL GIVE YOU MY AUNTY'S ADDRESS WHAT'S YOUR AUNTY'S ADDRESS THEN 
BUT IN THE END THEY COME UP WITH AN ADDRESS THAT WE CAN SERVE A SUMMONS 
OR GO AND LOOK FOR THEM SHOULD WE NEED TO 
ACROSS TOWN THE NOOSE IS CLOSING IN ON THE STOLEN CAR SEEN IN TESCO'S IN THE MORNING THE RED RENAULT LAGUNA 
I JUST GLANCED ACROSS AND SAW A LAGUNA OF THE RIGHT TYPE AND COLOUR 
I WAS FAIRLY SURE AT THAT TIME THAT WAS IT 
THAT'S IT 
THEIR LIGHTS HAD TURNED TO GREEN AND THAT LINE OF CARS HAD SET OFF SO WE NEEDED TO GET TURNED AROUND 
LEFT TURN LEFT 
ALPHA TEN TWO ZERO 
IT WAS A GOOD FEELING AND SOMETIMES THAT'S JUST THE LUCK OF THE DRAW ON THE DAY 
TWO ZERO ONTO LADYSMITH ROAD WE'RE BEHIND THE RED RENAULT LAGUNA 
WE WERE KEEN TO SPOT IT AND WE JUST DROPPED ON IT 
WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR ME COS I'M LIKE A JONAH 
I NEVER EVER GET TO DROP ON STOLEN CARS 
WITH THE CHASE ON THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE COPS ARE STILL TIED UP 
WITH THE MAN WITH NO SEATBELT OR ADDRESS 
HAVE YOU BEEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE BEFORE 
YEAH BUT NOT FOR A WHILE 
HERE WE GO SOMEONE'S BEHIND THE STOLEN CAR 
IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE FOLLOWING IT THEY'D NOT TRIED TO STOP IT 
GET THE HELICOPTER 
OF COURSE AT THE BRIEFING I'M THINKING SOUTH YORKSHIRE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THAT RED LAGUNA 
WE'RE GONNA GET THE RED LAGUNA 
THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF INTER FORCE RIVALRY 
OSCAR NINETY NINE PLEASE 
DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE YET WE'RE BEHIND AT LADYSMITH ROAD TOWARDS DERVAN ROAD 
NO ATTEMPT TO STOP THE VEHICLE AT THIS TIME 
IT'S THE MAN WITH NO SEATBELT'S LUCKY DAY

HOUGHTON AND SCOTHERN HAVE GOT A MORE IMPORTANT TASK TO DEAL WITH 
SOUTH YORKSHIRE PRIDE 
WE GAVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT GIVE HIM A SCARBOROUGH WARNING IT WAS HIS LUCKY DAY 
A SCARBOROUGH WARNING IS YOUR LAST CHANCE 
YOU'RE ON YOUR FINALS YELLOW CARD DON'T DO IT AGAIN 
THE RED LAGUNA DRIVER WON'T BE GETTING AWAY SO LIGHTLY 
IN MY EXPERIENCE WITH PEOPLE IN STOLEN CARS IS THEY'RE NOT GONNA STOP 
THEY'RE GONNA PUT UP SOME KIND OF RESISTENCE TO YOU 
RIGHT INDICATION INTO SIXHILLS 
BUT THIS DRIVER'S RESISTANCE IS WANING 
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA STOP STAND BY 
HE'S LOST HIS BOTTLE 
JUST STOPPED AT THE ROADSIDE 
THAT SORT OF THREW US A LITTLE BIT 
IS THIS YOUR CAR IT'S YOUR GRANDDAD'S 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME FELLA WHO

THANK YOU 
THEY GAVE UP COS THEY REALISED IT WAS ME AND HEATHER AND NOT THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE LADS 
WE'VE GOT TWO IN THE VEHICLE STAND BY 
BEATEN TO THE LAGUNA DRIVER BY THE HUMBERSIDE COPS 
SCOTHERN AND HOUGHTON CAN TURN THEIR ATTENTION BACK TO THE MAN WITH NO SEATBELT THEY'D JUST LET GO 
CAN WE STOP HIM AND SORT THAT OUT FINISH IT OFF NO ARE YOU SURE I TOLD HIM IT WAS HIS LUCKY DAY 
I THINK HE WAS A LUCKY YOUNG MAN THAT DAY HE DIDN'T GET A FINE 
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE LAGUNA DRIVER'S LUCKY DAY 
WE'VE HAD A REPORT THE VEHICLE'S BEEN STOLEN FROM TESCO TODAY IT'S NOT A STOLEN CAR 
THE COPS DON'T BELIEVE HIS STORY 
WE'RE NOT GETTING QUITE THE FULL STORY AT THE MOMENT I'M SURE WE WILL 
IT'S NOT EVEN NICKED MATE 
IT CHECKED OUT THAT IT WAS HIS GRANDDAD'S CAR BUT HIS GRANDDAD HAD REPORTED IT STOLEN 
IT MAY WELL BE HIS GRANDDAD'S CAR BUT WHAT'S IN IT CERTAINLY ISN'T 
THERE'S A BAG HERE THAT'S JUST FULL OF HYPODERMIC NEEDLES 
WE NEED A VAN 
IT'S BACK AT THE DOOBRY 
WE'RE NOT GONNA OPEN THERE BUT THERE'S A LOAD OF PIECES OF PAPER WRAPPED UP 
IT MIGHT BE THAT THEY'RE JUST WIPES BUT WHAT APPEARS 
POSSIBLY TO BE CLASS A WRAPPED UP IN INDIVIDUAL WRAPS AND SOME SORT OF EQUIPMENT FOR BURNING IT 
A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY MOBILE PHONES LIGHTERS USUAL DRUG PARAPHENALIA 
THAT'S ABOUT IT 
IT HAD BEEN STOLEN SEVERAL DAYS EARLIER IN SCOTLAND BUT IT HAD ACTUALLY MADE 
OFF WITHOUT PAYMENT FOR PETROL AT OUR TESCOS WHICH IS WHY AGAIN IT CAME TO OUR ATTENTION AND CIRCULATED 
WE HAPPENED TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME 
WITH SO MANY COPS OUT ON THE ROADS TODAY THEY ARE IN ALMOST EVERY PLACE NEARLY ALL OF THE TIME 
NOTHING'S GOING TO GET AWAY 
NOT EVEN AIDED BY A SMOKE SCREEN 
THERE'S NO NEED FOR P. C. WIDGERY AND P. C. BOYD TO BURN RUBBER TO CATCH THIS FIRE BREATHING DRAGON 
I THINK THE FIRST THING WE SAW WAS THE SMOKE 
WE DO LOOK OUT FOR DEFECTIVE CARS 
BUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS SO EXTREME YOU CAN'T NOT NOTICE IT 
IT'S THERE SOMEWHERE 
OH YOU CAN SMELL IT 
THAT'S A QUALITY JOB IT'S RIDICULOUS 
HE'D BE HARD PUSHED TO BE DRIVING THAT CAR WITHOUT KNOWING THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH IT 
I'VE JUST HAD TO FILL MY RADIATOR UP COS THAT WAS EMPTY YOUR WATER RADIATOR 
YEAH THAT ISN'T GONNA AFFECT YOUR EXHAUST IS IT 
NO JUST START YOUR ENGINE FOR US WHILE WE'RE HERE 
IT STALLED TWICE IT STALLED ON 
JUST FIRE IT UP FOR US 
HE SAID THAT HE'D GOT NO WATER IN THE RADIATOR BUT THAT WOULDN'T CAUSE 
THE SMOKE TO COME OUT OF THE EXHAUST SYSTEM LIKE IT WAS FROM THAT VEHICLE 
THAT WAS THE REASON HE CAME UP WITH 
WHY HAVE YOU BEEN RUNNING IT WITH THE EXHAUST LIKE THAT 
WELL IT'S ONLY JUST STARTED WHAT JUST TODAY 
YEAH I'VE JUST FINISHED WORK RIGHT 
I JUST FINISHED WORK AT HALF PAST THREE RIGHT 
AND IT JUST STARTED DOING IT THAT BAD 
MY COLLEAGUE IS JUST DOING SOME CHECKS ON THE ROAD 
CAN YOU COME AND SIT IN THE BACK OF THE CAR WITH ME I'LL HAVE A CHAT WITH YOU 
THERE'S NO SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE AS THEY SAY 
THE MAN'S GOING TO BE CHECKED OUT TO SEE IF HE'S DRIVING LEGITIMATELY 
YES YES 
THERE ARE NO REPORTS 
WHERE DO YOU WORK AT GILBERT 
ER GRIMSBY FISH MARKET 
CAN YOU CONFIRM THERE'S A M. O. T. HELD ON IT AS WELL PLEASE 
IF ALL THE CHECKS COME BACK GILBERT YEAH ALL I'M GONNA DO IS GIVE YOU A VDRS FORM 
VDR FORM THAT'S A VEHICLE DEFECTS RECTIFICATION FORM 
AND WHAT WE SAY TO THE DRIVER IS THAT THEY'VE ALREADY COMMITTED AN OFFENCE BY USING THE CAR IN THAT CONDITION 
THE OFFENCE HAS BEEN COMMITTED BUT WE ARE GIVING THEM THE CHANCE TO PUT THE FAULT RIGHT 
AND THEN EVERYBODY'S HAPPY AND THEN YOU END UP NOT BEING PROSECUTED 
AND WE AS THE POLICE KNOW THAT THE CAR'S BEEN REPAIRED 
IT'S INSURED THERE'S A M. O. T. ON IT TIL NEXT YEAR AND THE DRIVER HAS GOT A CURRENT DRIVING LICENCE 
SO HIS DOCUMENTS ARE O. K. IT'S JUST THE SHEER VOLUME OF SMOKE 
ALL RIGHT MATE I THINK WE'RE DONE WE'LL LET YOU OUT 
TAKE CARE 
CHEERS MATE SEE YOU LATER 
THE MAN'S ALL LEGAL AND FREE TO GO 
UNFORTUNATELY HIS CAR THE DRAGON IS GOING NOWHERE IT'S BEEN SLAIN

SMURKE EMITTING SMURKE SMURKE 
RUNNERS WHAT ARE THEY RUNNING FROM 
NOW THE SMURKE HAS CLEARED BOYD AND WIDGERY 
CAN SEE ANOTHER BURNING ISSUE FIGHTING AT THE END OF THE STREET 
WE SAW TWO MALES RUN ACROSS THE JUNCTION 
DIDN'T THINK TOO MUCH OF IT INITIALLY 
THEN A BUS DRIVER FLAGGED US DOWN 
HE SAID THAT THE TWO MALES HAD JUST BEEN FIGHTING 
I'VE JUST SEEN RUNNERS RUN THAT WAY 
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU 
THERE WERE SOME LADS RAN OFF 
THERE'S NOBODY FIGHTING DOWN THERE 
AS WE TURNED INTO THE STREETS WE COULD ONLY THEN SEE ONE OF THEM 
PRESUMABLY THE FIRST ONE HAD CARRIED ON AND HAD DISAPPEARED 
PARDON PARDON AS WELL 
THE MAN SEEN FIGHTING BY THE BUS DRIVER IS STILL IN A FIGHTING MOOD 
SOMEBODY THAT IS KNOWN TO ME WE'VE HAD DEALINGS WITH BEFORE 
AND EVEN AS DRUNK AS HE WAS I THINK HE WAS STILL QUITE CAPABLE OF BEING AGGRESSIVE 
AND FIGHTING WITH SOMEBODY 
JUST STAND THERE WE'RE TALKING TO YOU WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM 
I'M TALKING TO HIM 
HE'S THREATENED TO KNOCK ME OUT RIGHT WHY'S HE DONE THAT TO KNOCK ME OUT WHY'S HE DONE THAT 
ASK HIM HE WAS ONLY MESSING ABOUT WITH THAT KID MATE 
LEAVE HIM WITH US THANK YOU HE WAS ONLY MESSING 
THANKS VERY MUCH THEN THE BUS DRIVER SAYS YOU WERE FIGHTING ASK HIM 
JUST DO SOME CHECKS 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME WE MET YOU BEFORE SCOTT WHAT 
SCOTT CUMMINGS THAT'S IT

FROM MY DEALINGS WITH HIM HE CAN BE QUITE VOLATILE 
HE CAN BE O. K. ONE SECOND THE NEXT SECOND QUITE AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS YOU 
WHAT'S YOUR DATE OF BIRTH OFF WHAT'S YOUR DATE OF BIRTH 
HE WAS DRUNK STRUGGLING TO STAND UP AND JUST AWKWARD REALLY MORE THAN ANYTHING 
SCOTT ANTHONY CUMMINGS TWENTY FOUR TWO HUNDRED FIVE POINT EIGHT FOUR 
WANTED MISSING 
HE'S A DISQUALIFIED DRIVER 
HE'S ON WARNINGS RE VICTOR INDIA DELTA ROMEO 
I'VE DEALT WITH HIM FOLLOWING AN ACCIDENT BEFORE WHERE HE'S BEEN DRIVING IN THAT KIND OF STATE 
PUT YOUR LEG IN OFF 
YOU SILLY WE'VE GOT HIM IN THE CAR AT THE MOMENT HE'S NOT VERY HELPFUL 
SO YOU'VE HAD NO REPORTS WHO YOU BEEN MESSING ABOUT WITH THEN I WASN'T 
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING TODAY 
YOUR MAM THAT'S WHO I'VE BEEN MESSING AROUND WITH YOU LOOK OUT YOUR HEAD YOU DO 
BE ABLE TO COME IN FOR D. AND AMP D. I THINK 
I THINK TAKE HIM IN 
BOOK HIM DEAL WITH HIM 
P. C. BOYD IS LOSING PATIENCE WITH THE MAN 
WE ALREADY KNOW HE'S BEEN FIGHTING AND CHASING SOMEBODY 
THE WAY HE WAS BEHAVING AND THE LANGUAGE HE WAS USING HE WASN'T GOING TO CALM DOWN 
IF WE JUST DRIVE OFF AND LEAVE HIM OR WE TAKE HIM HOME AND LEAVE HIM HE'S GOING TO CARRY ON AGAIN 
AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME YOU'RE UNDER ARREST ALL RIGHT YEAH 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND 
YEAH ALL RIGHT YEAH YEAH 
TWO OF THEM THERE'S ONE IN CUSTODY MALE ADULT MR. CUMMINGS 
DRUNK AND DISORDERLY 
YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL IF YOU WANT IT YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL IF IT MATTERED SO MUCH 
I KNOW I WOULDN'T MIND 
YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL IF YOU WANT IT 
YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL IF IT MEANT SO MUCH 
GOLDEN TOUCH BY RAZORLIGHT 
I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T MIND 
YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL IF YOU WANT IT 
YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL IF IT MATTERED SO MUCH 
ALL THEY KNOW IS HOW TO PUT YOU DOWN 
A LOT OF THE TIME IT'S PEOPLE THAT ARE DRUNK THEY'LL SING 
BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THEY'RE NOT BOTHERED ABOUT BEING LOCKED UP 
HERE'S THE VAN 
LIFT YOUR LEGS YOU'RE COMING OUT 
I THINK HE PROBABLY WAS BOTHERED 
NOBODY REALLY IN MY EXPERIENCE WANTS TO BE LOCKED UP 
IT'S ALL PART OF THE IMAGE THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE SYSTEM SO MANY TIMES I'M NOT BOTHERED 
DO WHAT YOU WANT I'LLJUST SING 
THE MAN'S OFF TO THE NICK 
HE'S GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO SERENADE THE CUSTODY STAFF THERE 
TO GET TO GRIMSBY FROM HULL THE ONLY REAL WAY IS TO TAKE THE A FIFTEEN OVER THE MAJESTIC HUMBER BRIDGE 
P. C. ANDY STAINTON HAS A TACTIC FOR INTERCEPTING CRIMINALS MAKING THE TRIP 
PARKING HIS SUBARU UP AND WAITING FOR THEM TO COME PAST 
WE OBVIOUSLY MONITOR THE TRAFFIC THAT FLOWS BY 
IT'S GOT TWO OR THREE BIG BOXES IN THE BACK OF IT 
I THOUGHT THERE'S SOMETHING NOT QUITE RIGHT HE CAN'T SEE THROUGH HIS MIRRORS 
BECAUSE THE BOXES ARE THERE WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT HE DOES 
STAINTON SEEMS TO HAVE HIT LUCKY 
THE CAR WITH TWO MEN ON BOARD IS NOT SLOWING DOWN 
THEY MUST HAVE A PRETTY GOOD REASON 
IF THEY THINK THEY CAN OUTRUN THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILE AN HOUR SUBARU IMPREZA 
THE CHECK ON THE COMPUTER OF THE VEHICLE'S REGISTRATION EXPLAINS EVERYTHING 
CAME BACK THAT SOMEBODY HAD CALLED CRIMESTOPPERS TO SUGGEST THAT THE OCCUPANTS OF THAT VEHICLE 
WERE INVOLVED IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF DRUGS WITHIN THE HUMBERSIDE AREA 
THE CITROEN'S FAST BUT NO MATCH FOR THE SUBARU 
NEVERTHELESS STAINTON WANTS THE CHOPPER 
MY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO GET ONTO THE RADIO 
AND ORGANISE RESOURCES TO HELP US' 
THE MAIN RESOURCE THAT WE WOULD USE ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION IS OSCAR NINETY NINE THE HELICOPTER 
THE HELICOPTER WILL HAVE A GOOD OVERVIEW OF WHAT IT'S DOING WHERE IT'S LIKELY TO GO 
WE'VE HAD TO SLOW AND NEGOTIATE ROUND THE BACK OF HIM 
WE DIDN'T GET THROUGH THE SAME GAP THE CITROEN DID 
IT'S TAKEN THE SECOND 
HIS DRIVING WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS' 
IN TWENTY YEARS OF SERVICE IT'S PROBABLY UP THERE IN THE TOP TEN 
OF PURSUITS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN IF NOT THE TOP FIVE 
HE IS OVERTAKING IN THE FACE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC 
THE DRIVER IS DESPERATE TO GET AWAY 
THE RECKLESSNESS OF IT OVERTAKING IN THE FACE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC OVERTAKING ON BLIND BENDS 
OVERTAKING ON BLIND HILLS 
OVERTAKING WHERE THERE WERE SOLID LINES DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD 
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHY HE'S FLEEING FROM US AND AT THAT POINT 
IT HAS TO BE FAIRLY SERIOUS FOR HIM TO DRIVE LIKE HE DID 
NOW APPROACHING THE SWEEPING BEND AT THE CEMENT WORKS 
STILL OVERTAKING IN THE FACE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC 
HE'S OVERTAKING THE BUS 
A BUS HAD TO TAKE AVOIDING ACTION 
AND IT WAS FULL OF SCHOOLCHILDREN 
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T OVERTAKE AT THE SAME TIME 
THEY MANAGED TO GET QUITE SOME DISTANCE AHEAD OF US 
THE SUBARUS ARE A QUICK VEHICLE 
IT WAS VITAL THEN THAT THAT POWER WAS USED AND IT WAS 
LEFT LEFT LEFT CROXTON ROAD 
CROXTON ROAD 
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT 
IN THE VILLAGE IT'S AN UNCLASSIFIED ROAD EAST END 
THEY WERE SINGLE TRACK COUNTRY ROADS AND HE WAS DRIVING 
AT SPEEDS OF SEVENTY EIGHTY NINETY M. P. H. 
IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN COMING THE OTHER WAY 
THERE'D HAVE BEEN NO CHANCE FOR ANY VEHICLES 
THE MEN IN THE CAR HAVE GOT A PLAN TO LOSE THE COPS 
THEY'RE MAKING FOR OPEN COUNTRYSIDE 
HE TOOK A NEARSIDE FORK INTO A FIELD 
APPEARS TO BE ON A GRASS TRACK IT WAS QUITE BUMPY QUITE RUTTED 
THE RUTS WERE FILLED WITH WATER QUITE SLIPPERY 
I'M THANKFUL THAT AT THAT POINT OSCAR NINETY NINE CAME ABOVE US' 
WE'RE JUST PLOTTING THE VEHICLE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE 
HE'S ON THE TRACK NOW SOUTH OF THE WOOD 
IT WASN'T JUST YOUR NORMAL DAY TO DAY TRYING TO EVADE CAPTURE 
HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO GET AWAY SO THERE WAS SOMETHING SERIOUS THAT HE WAS HIDING 
CRIME OFFICE TO OSCAR NINETY NINE JUST BEAR IN MIND IT'S DRUGS DRUGS RELATED 
THERE WERE TIMES WHERE THE AIRCRAFT HAD TO GO DOWN QUITE LOW 
IN CASE HE STARTED THROWING THINGS OUT THE WINDOW BECAUSE WE BELIEVED THIS VEHICLE WAS CARRYING DRUGS 
CAN YOU GET AS MANY PATROLS PLEASE TOWARDS THIS AREA 
LOTS OF WOODS HERE 
IF HE ABANDONS IT WE CAN ONLY CONTAIN THE WOOD 
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE HIM 
IF HE DUMPS IT AND DECIDES TO RUN IN AN AREA THAT'S DIFFICULT TO COVER BY THE HELICOPTER 
WE HAD TO BE THERE TO TRY AND ARREST YOUR LOCATION PLEASE 
HE'S HEADING GENERALLY TOWARDS IMMINGHAM 
IF WE CAN GET ANY STINGERS AT THE END OF THIS ROAD 
HE CONTINUED TO DRIVE AT BREAK NECK SPEED 
NINETY NINE IT'S APPROACHING THE T. JUNCTION AT IMMINGHAM 
WE THEN MANAGED TO CLOSE THE GAP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE OF THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR VEHICLE 
AND THE COMMENTARY FROM OSCAR NINETY NINE DIRECTING US IN 
IT'S A RIGHT RIGHT ONTO PILGRIM AVENUE PILGRIM AVENUE 
WE CONTINUED TO OVERTAKE IN DANGEROUS POSITIONS 
CAUSING VEHICLES TO SWERVE AND ALTER COURSE 
THE CAR IS HEADING FOR A COUNCIL ESTATE IN IMMINGHAM 
IT COULD BE WHERE THE OCCUPANTS LIVE AND THEY'RE JUST IN A HURRY TO GET HOME 
THERE WILL BE A CUT OFF FOR HIS VEHICLE 
GO TO THE NEXT ROUNDABOUT AND FLOAT AROUND THERE 
NINETY NINE STOP STOP RUNNERS 
DRIVER DETAINED ONE RUNNER THERE WERE BLOWS EXCHANGED 
WE SCUFFLED THEN I EVENTUALLY MANAGED TO RESTRAIN HIM 
THE OTHER RUNNER HAS GOT AWAY HE THINKS 
BUT HE HASN'T BARGAINED FOR THE ALL SEEING EYE IN THE SKY 
NEXT LEFT NEXT LEFT 
FORTUNATELY BECAUSE OSCAR NINETY NINE WAS WITH US STRAIGHTAWAY THEY WERE ABLE TO MONITOR THAT PERSON 
HE'S OUT THE FRONT DOOR 
HE'S OUT THE FRONT DOOR 
HE'S IN THE STREET AT THE FRONT DOOR 
WALKING CASUALLY 
TWO OFFICERS IN THE BACK GARDEN GO ROUND THE FRONT QUICKLY 
OUR MAN IS ENTERING THE NEIGHBOUR'S PROPERTY 
AND HE'S STRAIGHT IN HE'S WEARING A WHITE SHIRT 
YOUR COLLEAGUE'S GOT THE RIGHT PROPERTY 
HE'S WEARING A WHITE SHIRT BLUE TROUSERS 
MALE PROBABLY GETTING ON TOWARDS FORTY 
GREY HAIR ACTING VERY CASUALLY 
THE OFFICERS ON THE GROUND WERE DIRECTED TO THAT HOUSE 
GIVEN A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE MALE LOOKED LIKE 
THEY WENT IN AND THEY BROUGHT A MALE OUT 
BUT NOW HE HAD A RED TOP ON NINETY NINE 
THAT COULD WELL BE HIM WITH A CHANGE OF TOP 
O. K. ROGER 
HE KNEW THE HELICOPTER WAS THERE BECAUSE HE CHANGED HIS TOP HE WENT FROM A WHITE TOP TO A RED TOP 
TRYING ANYTHING HE COULD TO GET AWAY FROM THE OFFICERS ON THE GROUND 
I'VE GOT ONE PRISONER IN HERE RIGHT 
THE NEIGHBOURS ARE OUT IN FULL SEEING WHAT THE FUSS IS ALL ABOUT 
QUITE A LARGE CROWD GATHERED 
SOME OF THEM WERE QUITE HOSTILE TOWARDS THE POLICE 
PROBABLY FIFTY OR SIXTY PEOPLE A LOT OF THEM WERE CHILDREN 
THEY JUST WATCHED INNOCENT BYSTANDERS AS SUCH 
THINK I'M AN IDIOT WE'VE SEEN YOU DO IT 
WE'VE SEEN YOU DO IT IT'S TOO LATE NOW 
TWO OR THREE OF THE ADULTS WERE VERBALLY HOSTILE AND AGGRESSIVE 
I WASN'T SURE WHY BECAUSE WE'D STOPPED THIS FELLA FROM POTENTIALLY KILLING ONE OF THEIR CHILDREN 
WE'RE DEPARTING BECAUSE IT'S CREATING CHAOS 
THAT'S THE CAR THAT'S IT WE'RE JUST GETTING CHAOS HERE 
BECAUSE THE CROWD WAS SWELLING THE DECISION WAS TO REMOVE THE PRISONERS 
GET US OUT OF THERE AND GET TO SOMEWHERE SAFE 
MEANWHILE THE SINGING DRUNK HAS ALSO BEEN ESCORTED TO SOMEWHERE SAFE GRIMSBY POLICE STATION 
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM 
THE CUSTODY SUITE'S BUSY SO THE COPS WILL HAVE TO SUFFER A DELAY AND SOME MORE CROONING 
ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE 
HE WAS SINGING ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE 
WHICH WAS QUITE AMUSING REALLY 
HE WOULDN'T GET PAST THE FIRST ROUND WITH SIMON COWELL ON X. FACTOR 
PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE WISE TO GIVE UP HIS DAY JOB 
FAT CHANCE 
ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF DEATH 
JUST BEFORE YOU DRAW YOUR TERMINAL BREATH 
HE'S GOING TO BE IN CUSTODY UNTIL HE'S SOBER ENOUGH TO BE DEALT WITH 
WHICH FOR HIM IN THAT STATE COULD BE QUITE A FEW HOURS 
BECAUSE THE POLICE CAN'T DEAL WITH HIM UNTIL HE'S IN A FIT ENOUGH STATE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING 
SO HE WOULD PROBABLY BE THERE MOST OF THE NIGHT 
AT THE POLICE STATION IN IMMINGHAM THE TWO SUSPECTED DRUG DEALERS 
CAUGHT ON THE ESTATE ARE LOOKING AT A STRETCH INSIDE TOO 
P. C. STAINTON HAS BROUGHT IN THE EVIDENCE THAT WILL CONDEMN THEM 
I ACTUALLY DROVE THE CITROEN IN TO IMMINGHAM POLICE STATION SO WE COULD LOOK WHAT WAS IN IT 
TWENTY BAGS 
TWENTY KILOS MAYBE 
SHRINK WRAPPED OR HEAT SEALED BAGS OF CANNABIS BUSH OR POSSIBLY SKUNK 
ARREST ON POSSESSION WITH INTENT TO SUPPLY AS WELL ALL RIGHT 
OOH IT SMELLS NICE DOESN'T IT 
THE HAUL IS A BIG ONE TWENTY FOUR KILOGRAMS WORTH ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
WHICH EXPLAINS JUST WHY THE MEN WERE SO DESPERATE TO GET AWAY 
IT ALSO THEN DAWNED ON ME THAT IT WAS QUITE APPARENT WHY SOME MEMBERS OF THE CROWD WERE HOSTILE TOWARDS US 
IN RELATION TO THE ARREST BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THEY WERE PERHAPS WAITING FOR SOME OF THIS CANNABIS 
TO USE THEMSELVES AND WE'D TAKEN OUT THEIR BIG DEALER 
THE DRIVER'S ACCOUNTED FOR HIS DRIVING BY SAYING HE PANICKED WHEN HE SAW THE BLUE LIGHTS 
I HAD SCUFFS ON MY KNEES BRUISES ON MY SHOULDER AND ARM FROM WRESTLING ON THE GROUND THAT'S PART OF THE JOB 
YOU'VE GOT ONE IN THERE THE OTHER VAN'S READY FOR THAT CHAP 
HE'S GOING TO SCUNTHORPE THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO SCUNNY 
WE FOUND DRUGS SECRETED BENEATH THE CARPETS 
THERE WAS SPEED AMPHETAMINE ECSTASY TABLETS' 
NOT HUGE AMOUNTS AMOUNTS WHICH WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR PERSONAL USE 
IT MAY WELL BE HE LOOKED ABSOLUTELY KNACKERED BECAUSE HIS SPEED OR ECSTASY HAD RUN OUT 
HAS HE BEEN SEARCHED 
THE TWO PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED CONCERNING THE SUPPLY AND CONTROL OF DRUGS 
THE DRIVER FOR DRIVING ISSUES AS WELL 
A LARGE QUANTITY OF DRUGS WAS TAKEN OFF THE STREETS 
A LOT OF OUR TIME SPENT IS DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO USE DEAL AND ABUSE DRUGS 
AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TRYING TO STOP THAT CYCLE STOP THAT CHAIN 
IN GRIMSBY TODAY'S JOINT FORCES OPERATION IS ALMOST OVER 
BUT NOT WITHOUT A BIT MORE BURNING RUBBER 
COME ON WE'RE BOOKING HIM 
WE KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG NOBODY DRIVES LIKE THAT UNLESS THEY'VE BEEN DRINKING OR IT'S STOLEN 
LIGHTS ARE ON THE DRIVER HAS SEEN THE LIGHTS 
HE'S PULLING OVER 
HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT IF IT HAD BEEN A MARKED POLICE VEHICLE 
WHICH GAVE US THE EDGE 
THE COPS' HUNCH IS CONFIRMED 
YES COME ON I'VE HAD A DRINK MATE COME OVER TO THE CAR 
I'M NOT GOING TO NOT ADMIT IT I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU 
I'VE HAD A COUPLE OF PINTS YEAH YOU STINK DON'T YOU 
THE MAN'S ADMITTED HE'S BEEN DRINKING 
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY SOZZLED 
HE HAD NO CLUE OF WHAT HE'D DONE IN MY OPINION HE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHERE HE WAS' 
HE HELD HIS HANDS UP AND SAID YOU'VE GOT ME I'M DRUNK 
BLOW HARDER HARDER 
YOU'RE NOT BLOWING HARD ENOUGH JUST STOP 
RIGHT IT'S GOING TO FAIL ANYWAY 
I'M ARRESTING YOU ON SUSPICION OF DRIVING WHILST UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL 
YES DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 
IT'S QUITE IRONIC ACTUALLY BECAUSE HE'D ACTUALLY TAKEN A DAY OFF SICK FROM WORK TO GO DRINKING 
I'M BLOWING AT THE MOMENT ON THE ROADSIDE SOMETHING LIKE EIGHTY SIX 
HE'S LOOKING AT POSSIBLY BEING THREE TIMES OVER THE LIMIT 
IF HE'D GONE TO WORK NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED 
AND HE'D BE DRIVING AROUND HAPPY AS LARRY 
INSTEAD HE'S LOST HIS LICENCE POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE LOST HIS JOB 
AT THE POLICE STATION IT'S TIME TO TOT UP THE DAY'S TAKINGS 
TWO ENDORSABLE TWO NON ENDORSABLE 
AND THEN THERE'S YOUR TWO D. AND AMP DS I DON'T KNOW WHOSE THEY'VE GONE DOWN ON 
MINE OF COURSE 
THE DRINK DRIVER BROUGHT IN BY P. C. SCOTHERN HAS A CONFESSION TO MAKE 
WHICH IS GOING TO INCREASE THE SCORE EVEN MORE 
I'M NOT LYING MATE I'VE GOT TEN YOU WHAT SORRY I'VE GOT TEN DIAZEPAM IN ME POCKET 
HAND THEM OVER THEN TA 
HE'S GOT A LOAD OF A PRESCRIPTION TRANQUILISERS DOWN HIS TROUSERS 
OBVIOUSLY I WILL NOW ARREST YOU ON SUSPICION OF BEING ON A CLASS A DRUG 
YOU'RE STILL UNDER CAUTION THAT'S CLASS B. CLASS B. IS IT 
THEY'RE SLEEPING TABLETS ALL RIGHT 
HE WENT INSIDE HIS TROUSERS AND PULLED OUT A MATCHBOX FULL OF LITTLE TABS 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE UNTIL HE IDENTIFIED THEM FOR ME 
AND THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE MAN'S CONFESSIONS 
THEN HE PULLED OUT SOME COCAINE 
THE GUY HAD GOT CLASS A AND CLASS B. DRUGS ON HIM 
WHAT LOOKED LIKE JUST AN EVERYDAY GUY THAT YOU'D SEE 
HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A DRUG ADDICT OR A SUBSTANCE ABUSER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT WAS AN UNUSUAL ONE 
ON OUR JOURNEY TO THIS POLICE STATION HE'S PRODUCED THAT FROM HIS POCKET 
WHICH HE'S TELLING ME IS COCAINE AND IN THIS MATCHBOX IS TEN DIAZEPAM TABLETS CLASS B. DRUG 
HE'S BEEN ARRESTED FOR DRIVING UNFIT THROUGH DRINK AND DRUGS 
IN POSSESSION OF CLASS A AND POSSESSION OF CLASS B. DRUGS 
EVERYBODY TURNED DRUGS OUT OF THEIR POCKETS 
IT WAS A VERY STRANGE DAY WE'VE HAD DRUGS ON EVERYBODY 
FOR TODAY'S TAKINGS IN GRIMSBY WE'VE HAD TWENTY VEHICLE SEIZURES FOR NO INSURANCE OR NO LICENCE 
TWENTY FOUR STOP SEARCHES EIGHTEEN INTELLIGENCE REPORTS 
THREE ARRESTS FOR DRUGS WITH INTENT TO SUPPLY IN SEPARATE JOBS 
ELEVEN SUMMONS FILES IN TOTAL 
TWO ENDORSABLE FIXED PENALTY TICKETS TWO NON ENDORSABLE FIXED PENALTY TICKETS 
ONE OVER THE LIMIT WITH A QUANTITY OF CLASS A DRUGS 
AND THE TWO FOR THE THEFT OF A MOTOR VEHICLE 
SO ALL IN ALL A VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL DAY IN GRIMSBY 
WE'VE EXPERIENCED A DIFFERENT TERRAIN DIFFERENT ESTATES AND WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD PRISONERS 
IT'S NICE THAT WE'VE COME HERE AND MADE OUR MARK AND SHOWN THAT WE CAN WORK IN AN AREA WHERE WE DON'T KNOW 
AND WE STILL MANAGED TO FIND THESE PEOPLE AND GET THEM LOCKED UP 
I THINK EVERYBODY WORKING ON THE OPERATION ENJOYED WORKING ON IT BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY WENT OUT 
AND WE DID SOMETHING AND WE MADE A DIFFERENCE 
THE MAN WHO ADMITTED HAVING A POCKETFUL OF ASSORTED DRUGS WAS FINED ONE HUNDRED 
FOR POSSESSING COCAINE AND BANNED FROM THE ROAD FOR TWO YEARS FOR DRINKING AND DRIVING 
THE MAN WHO WAS GOING BALD WAS BANNED FOR ONE YEAR FOR A VARIETY OF DRIVING OFFENCES 
HE WAS ALSO FINED ONE HUNDRED FOR HAVING SIX LUMPS OF CANNABIS WHICH HE HAD CONFISCATED 
THE MAN WHO TOOK HIS GRANDAD'S CAR AND FILLED IT WITH DRUG PARAPHERNALIA 
WAS CONVICTED OF DRIVING WHILST DISQUALIFIED AND MAKING OFF FROM A GARAGE WITHOUT PAYMENT 
HE WAS GIVEN A FOUR MONTH SUSPENDED PRISON SENTENCE AND BANNED FROM DRIVING FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS 
JASON ASLAM GIBSON THE RUNNER PLUCKED OUT OF THE HEDGE 
WAS SENT TO PRISON FOR FOUR MONTHS FOR DISQUALIFIED DRIVING AND AGGRAVATED VEHICLE TAKING 
NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AGAINST HIS PASSENGER 
SCOTT CUMMINGS THE DRUNK WHO SANG LIKE A CANARY 
WAS RELEASED AFTER A NIGHT IN THE CELLS AND WAS GIVEN A SIX MONTH CONDITIONAL DISCHARGE 
AND MICHAEL HUGHES THE DRUG DEALER WHO TRIED TO ESCAPE BY CHANGING HIS SHIRT 
WAS CONVICTED OF POSSESSING CANNABIS WITH INTENT TO SUPPLY AND LOCKED UP FOR FOUR YEARS 
HIS ACCOMPLICE FORTY YEAR OLD MARK SMITH ADMITTED THE SAME OFFENCE 
AND OTHERS OF POSSESSING AMPHETAMINE AND DANGEROUS DRIVING AND WAS JAILED FOR THREE YEARS
