BREACH OF THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS A 
JUDGE RULES THAT THE MOD HAS TO 
PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR 
SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN EVEN IN 
BATTLE 
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BATTLE PROVIDE THE EQUIPMENT PROVIDE ALL 
THE SERVICES THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY 
NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE STAY 
AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE 
BUT THE 
GOVERNMENT INSISTS BRITISH TROOPS 
ARE AMONG THE BEST EQUIPPED IN THE 
WORLD AND SAYS IT WILL APPEAL 
AGAINST THE DECISION ALSO TONIGHT 
THE BROTHER OF THE MAN WHO TRIED TO 
BLOW UP GLASGOW AIRPORT IS 
SENTENCED AFTER NOT TELLING POLICE 
WHAT HE KNEW 
BRITISH AIRWAYS CHANGES DIRECTION 
NOW IT DECIDES TO DELAY MOVING 
LONG HAUL FLIGHTS INTO TERMINAL FIVE 
PREMATURE BABIES THE B. B. C. LEARNS OF 
NEW RESEARCH WHICH COULD SHAPE THE 
DEBATE ON ABORTION 
AND PARENTS' OUTRAGE AFTER A 
COUNCIL SPICE ON THEM AFTER IT 
BELIEVED THEY WERE CHEAT TO GO GET 
A SCHOOL PLACE 
I DEFINITELY FEEL 
CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE NAMED AS 
TARGETS OF SURVEILLANCE ABSOLUTELY 
NOT 
A CHILDHOOD FRIEND RELEASES A 
DESPERATE APPEAL TO FIND MARK 
SPEIGHT 
GOOD EVENING SENDING TROOPS INTO 
WAR OR OUT ON PATROL WITHOUT THE 
RIGHT EQUIPMENT COULD BE BREACH 
OF THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS A JUDGE SAID 
TODAY SOLDIERS SHOULD NOT LOSE ALL 
PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW SIMPLY 
BECAUSE THEY WERE IN BATTLE AND 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO RESPECT 
THEIR RIGHT TO LIFE WHERE POSSIBLE 
THE RULING COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR 
SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN TO CLAIM 
COMPENSATION THE MOD SAYS IT WILL 
APPEAL IN A FURTHER BLOW THE 
JUDGE ALSO RULED THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT'S ATTEMPT TO BAN 
CORONERS FROM CRITICISING THE MOD 
WAS UNLAWFUL 
THE FUNERAL OF PRIVATE JASON SMITH 
A TERRITORIAL SOLDIER WHO DIED IN 
IRAQ OF HEAT STROKE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX HIS 
DEATH HAS BECOME TEST CASE 
WHETHER THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 
SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR 
FATAL FAILURES TODAY IT WAS RULED 
IT IT SHOULD THE HIGH COURT SAYS 
SOLDIERS DO HAVE HUMAN RIGHTS WHAT WHAT THIS CASE DOES IS NAIL IT DOWN IT 
MAKES IT VERY CLEAR DOES THIS CASE 
THAT FROM NOW ON SOLDIERS OPERATING 
IN THEATRE HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS 
ANY CIVILIANS 
A COUPLE OF TRIPS UP THE VALLEY 
TALEBAN ARE KICKING AROUND AT THE 
MINUTE DODGY AREA 
CAPTAIN JAMES 
PHILIPPSON KILLED IN ACTION IN 
AFGHANISTAN EARLIER THIS YEAR AN 
OXFORD INQUEST HERALD HIS UNIT WERE 
TOTALLY OUTGUNNED AND CRITICALLY 
SHORT OF OF NIGHT VISION EQUIPMENT 
THE CORONER ACCUSED THE MOD OF 
BETRAYING THE TRUST OF BRITISH 
SOLDIERS WITH BRITISH FORCES 
TAKING CASUALTIES IN IRAQ AND 
AFGHANISTAN THE MOD HAS ALWAYS 
DEFENDED ITSELF FROM LAWSUITS FROM 
BEREAVED FAMILIES BY MAINTAINING 
THAT SOLDIERS OPERATING OUTSIDE 
BRITAIN BRITAIN WERE NOT GENERALLY 
COVERED BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 
THAT COULD NOW CHANGE 
WHAT IT IS 
DOING IS MAKING THE MOD MORE 
RESPONSIBLE IT'S MAKING THEM MEET 
THE GAMEPLAN NOW THEY'RE GOING TO 
HAVE TO PROVIDE ALL THE EQUIPMENT 
AND SERVICES THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY 
NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE STAY 
AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE 
WE ALREADY ARE 
SAID THE MOD WHICH IS APPEALING 
AGAINST TODAY'S RULING LOOK AT 
THIS ARMOURED VEHICLE THEY THEY 
WOULD SAY SOLDIERS ASKED FOR 
BETTER PROTECTION WE GAVE THEM THE 
MASTIFF COSTING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND EACH 
THERE'S BEEN GREAT IMPROVEMENTS 
MADE IN THEIR EQUIPMENT BECAUSE WE 
FOUND OURSELVES ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO 
IN A VERY DIFFICULT AND CHANGING 
ENVIRONMENT AND WE'VE PUT LOT OF 
INVESTMENT INTO THAT AND THEY ARE 
AS WELL EQUIPPED AS ANY TROOPS IN 
THE WORLD NOW SO THIS CRITICISM 
WHICH IS A DATED CRITICISM FROM 
DIFFERENT TIME ASK NOT AAPPLICABLE 
TO THE TROOPS THAT ARE PRESENTLY 
DEPLOYED 
CRITICS OF THE MOD WOULD DEPLOYED ARGUE THAT MANY OF THOSE 
IMPROVEMENTS TO EQUIPMENT ARE DUE 
TO THE PUBLIC OUTRAGE RAISED BY 
FAMILIES OF THE BEREAVED THEY'RE 
CERTAINLY WELCOMING THIS RULING 
OTHERS THOUGH ARGUE THAT TAKEN TO 
EXTREMES CONCERNS OVER SOLDIERS' 
HUMAN RIGHTS COULD END UP 
JEOPARDISING ENTIRE MILITARY 
OPERATIONS OPERATIONS TAKE NATO FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN 
FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE GERMANS 
WON'T FLY AT NIGHT AND SOME NATIONS 
ARE AVOIDING COMBAT ALTOGETHER 
BRITISH FORCES DON'T MIND THE 
ACTION BUT IF BETTER KIT CAN SAVE 
LIVES THEY EXPECT IT TO BE 
DELIVERED WITHOUT DELAY OR PENNY 
PINCHING FAILURES THERE MAY SOON 
BE ACCOUNTABLE IN LAW 
FRANK IS HERE WITH ME NOW WHERE 
DOES THIS DECISION MOD WELL THEY'RE NOT HAPPY THEY 
POSITION IS NOT 
UNDERSTOOD PROPERLY THEY'RE 
CHALLENGING IT WHEN I SPOKE TO 
THEM A FEW HOURS AGO THEY WERE 
REASONABLY CONFIDENT THEY WOULD WIN 
THEIR APPEAL IT'S NOT JUST 
MINISTERS AND POLITICIANS AND THE 
MOD WHO ARE TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AT 
THIS SENIOR MILITARY COMMANDERS 
HAVE ALSO GOT TO THINK O. K. WHERE 
DOES THIS END WELL ANY GOOD 
OFFICER WILL HAVE THE WELFARE OF 
THEIR MEN AND WOMEN UNDER THEIR 
COMMAND RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THEIR 
CONCERNS THEY'RE ALSO POSSIBLY 
GOING TO HAVE TO FACTOR IN WHAT 
ARE THEY GOING TO DO WHEN THERE'S A 
REALLY TIGHT SITUATION LET'S SAY 
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE HELMAND 
PROVINCE THE BRITISH UNIT HASN'T 
GOT ALL THE EQUIPMENT THEY WANT 
DO THEY REPEL THEM AND RISK A 
LAWSUIT THESE WILL BE CONCERNS 
THAT IF THE MOD APPEAL FAILS 
MILITARY COMMANDERS WILL HAVE TO 
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
THE BROTHER OF THE MAN WHO TRIED TO 
BLOW UP UP GLASGOW AIRPORT HAS BEEN 
SENTENCED TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN JAIL FOR 
WITHOLDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
PLOT PLOT SABEEL AHMED SAW AN INCRIMINATING 
E. MAIL FROM HIS BROTHER KAFEEL 
AFTER THE ATTACK BUT DIDN'T TELL 
THE POLICE WHEN HE WAS WAS ARRESTED 
THIS WAS THE MOMENT LAST SUMMER 
WHEN GLASGOW AIRPORT WAS RAMMED BY 
A BURNING CAR PACKED WITH GAS 
CYLINDERS TODAY WE LEARNED THAT 
THE MEN AT THE WHEEL KAFEEL AHMED 
HAD REPEATEDLY TRIED TO DRIVE THE 
VEHICLE RIGHT INTO THE TERMINAL 
WITH QUEUEING PASSENGERS JUST TWENTY 
FEET AWAY 
A DAY EARLIER HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO 
BOMB THE TIGER TIGER CLUB IN 
LONDON'S WEST END 
THERE WERE FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE CLUB 
THAT SUMMER NIGHT AND THEY WERE 
THE TARGETS OF A CAR BOMB PARKED 
DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE GLASS 
WINDOWS IT WAS ONLY BY SHEER GOOD 
FORTUNE THAT THE BOMB FAILED TO 
DETONATE PROPERLY THE EXPLOSIVE 
WAS A MIX OF FUEL VAPOR AND AIR 
AND THERE WAS TOO MUCH TOO MUCH 
FUEL VAPOR AND NOT ENOUGH AIR 
THE DEVICE IN GREEN MERCEDES ALSO 
PACKED WITH GAS SILLERS HAD BEEN 
TRIGGERED BY MOBILE PHONE BUT NO 
EXPLOSION HAD FOLLOWED 
TODAY KAFEEL'S BROTHER SABEEL 
AHMED AN N. H. S. DOCTOR COMPLETED 
GUILTY FOR FAILING TO TELL THE 
POLICE WHAT HE KNEW ABOUT THE 
ATTACKS INFORMATION CONTAINED IN 
AN E. MAIL 
KAFEEL HAD WRITTEN IT AT SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY SIX THAT 
THURSDAY MORNING IN THE EARLY 
HOURS OF FRIDAY HE LAUNCHED HIS 
ATTEMPTED ATTACK ON TIGER TIGER 
THE NEXT DAY HE TEXTED SABEEL TO 
READ THE NOTE HE'D SAVED AS AN E. 
MAIL IN DRAFT FORM AND HALF AN 
HOUR LATER DROVE THE P. IN 
GLASGOW AIRPORT'S TERMINAL ONE AT 
FOUR POINT TWO TWO THAT AFTERNOON SABEEL OWNED 
THE E. MAIL 
IN IT HIS BROTHER HAD WRITTEN 
AND WHEN SABEEL WAS ARRESTED HE 
DID TELL DETECTIVES THAT HIS 
BROTHER WAS DOING GLOBAL WARMING 
PROJECT IN ICELAND WHEN IN FACT HE 
WAS DYING FROM SELF INFLICTED BURNS 
IN GLASGOW SAAB BEAM WAS 
EFFECTIVELY SERVED HIS EIGHTEEN MONTH 
SENTENCE AND WILL NOW BE DEPORTED 
TO INDIA 
WHEN POLICE SEARCHED THIS HOUSE 
NEAR GLASGOW AIRPORT THEY FOUND 
ENOUGH EQUIPMENT TO HAVE BUILT THE 
CAR BOMBS IN GLASGOW AND LONDON AND 
SEVERAL FURTHER DEVICES 
TWO MORE MEN GO ON TRIAL IN THE 
AUTUMN AUTUMN IT'S TWO WEEKS NOW SINCE HEATHROW'S 
TERMINAL FIVE OPENED TO CHAOTIC SCENES 
OF CANCELLED FLIGHTS AND LOST 
BAGGAGE TODAY BRITISH AIRWAYS 
ANNOUNCED IT'S POSTPONING TRANSFER 
OF LONG HAUL FLIGHTS TO THE 
TERMINAL UNTIL JUNE IT SPARKED 
ANGER FROM OTHER AIRLINES AFFECTED 
BY THE DECISION ONE SAID IT WAS 
OUTRAGEOUS AND INCONSIDERATE 
APRIL THIRTIETH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 
FINAL PHASE OF THE BIG MOVE TO 
TERMINAL FIVE BUT NOW IT'S ABOUT TURN 
AND BACK TO TERMINAL FOUR AT LEAST 
FOR THE TIME BEING 
T. FIVE'S BLACK THURSDAY TWO WEEKS AGO 
CHAOS EVEN THOUGH THE TERMINAL WAS 
ONLY HALF FULL 
YOU HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT 
NO WONDER THE BRITISH NOT AIRWAYS BOSS HAS NOW DECIDED TO 
TAKE A PAUSE FOR BREATH BEFORE 
MOVING IN MORE FLIGHTS 
WHAT WE 
HAVE DECIDED TO DO IS USE THE DELAY 
TO ALLOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT YET 
WORKED IN T. FIVE THE BENEFIT OF WORKING 
SIDE BY SIDE WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
WORKED THERE SO THEY CAN LEARN FROM 
THEIR EXPERIENCE OF ACTUALLY 
WORKING IN T. FIVE 
ON DAY ONE TERMINAL FIVE HANDLED MORE 
THAN THREE HUNDRED NINETY FLIGHTS PHASE TWO WOULD 
HAVE INVOLVED MOVING IN ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
LONG HAUL FLIGHTS BUT BECAUSE THE 
PLANES ARE BIGGER IT WOULD HAVE 
HAVE DOUBLED THE PRESSURE ON THE 
TERMINAL THAT MOVE IS NOW DELAYED 
TO JUNE 
AND IT HAS A KNOCK ON EFFECT 
BECAUSE THIRTY OTHER AIRLINES ARE DUE 
TO MOVE IN TO TERMINAL FOUR ONCE 
BRITISH AIRWAYS HAS LEFT SOME OF 
ITS RIVALS ARE FURIOUS 
THERE'S BEEN A LONG PERIOD OF 
CONSULTATION OVER THE LAST TWO 
YEARS TO CHOREOGRAPH ALL THE 
AIRLINE MOVES OVER FIFTY AIRLINE 
MOVES AT HEATHROW IN THE NEXT FEW 
YEARS AND THAT'S BEEN DISREGARDED 
BY ONE UNILATERAL DECISION BY 
BRITISH 
AIRWAYS AND B. A. A. BRITISH BRITISH AIRWAYS IS ALSO TRYING TO CLEAR ITS 
BAGGAGE BACKLOG AT THE HEIGHT OF 
THE CRISIS THERE WERE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND LOST 
BAGS THAT'S NOW DOWN TO FIVE THOUSAND 
AWAITING RETURN TO THEIR OWNERS 
INCLUDING TWO THOUSAND AT AN ITALIAN 
FACILITY DESTINED FOR PASSENGERS 
OVERSEAS THIS WEEK TERMINAL FIVE HAS 
LARGELY RECOVERED ITS STAFF WILL 
WELCOME THE RESPITE BEFORE THE NEXT 
ONSLAUGHT ONSLAUGHT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT MORE 
CONFIDENCE MOVING IN JUNE WHEN 
THEY MOVED IN ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH MARCH A 
LOT OF THEM WERE NOT READY BRITISH 
AIRWAYS HAVE RECOGNISED THAT VERY 
PAINFULLY 
AGAIN BRITISH AIRWAYS PAINFULLY HAS NOT MADE ITSELF POPULAR RIVAL 
AIRLINES SEE IT AS A SPOILT CHILD 
THAT'S FRITTERED AWAY THE GIFT IT'S 
BEEN GIVEN IN TERMINAL FIVE AS FOR 
PASSENGERS THEY CARE LESS WHERE 
THEY FLY FROM THEY JUST WANT TO 
KNOW THEY'LL GET TO THEIR 
DESTINATIONS WITH THEIR THEIR BAGS 
THE CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING 
HAS SAID THAT THE GLOBAL CREDIT 
CRUNCH IS THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC 
SHOCK SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN 
THE NINETEEN THIRTIES IN A SPEECH IN 
WASHINGTON HE CALLED FOR URGENT 
ACTION BY THE WORLD'S BIGGEST 
ECONOMIES ECONOMIES WHAT WE CAN DO NOW IS TO ENSURE 
THAT RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD 
GOVERNMENTS AND BANKS DO EVERYTHING 
THEY POSSIBLY CAN TRY AND GET THE 
FINANCIAL MARKETS BACK TO NORMAL SO 
IN TURN THE BANKS CAN PROVIDE THE 
MONEY THAT PEOPLE NEED FOR THEIR 
BUSINESSES FOR BUYING HOUSES OR FOR 
PERSONAL USE 
IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVER 
STUDIES INTO PREMATURE BIRTHS AND 
IT COULD SHAME THE CURRENT DEBATE 
ABOUT ABORTION IN BRITAIN THE B. B. C. 
HAS LEARNED MORE THAN A THOUSAND 
BABIES INDICATED WITH SURVIVAL 
RATES BEFORE TWENTY FOUR WEEKS HAVE NOT 
IMPROVED IN MORE THAN A DECADE IT 
COULD BOLSTER THE ARGUMENT FOR 
KEEPING THE CURRENT TWENTY FOUR WEEK 
ABORTION LIMIT OUR MEDICAL 
CORRESPONDENT IS HERE THESE ARE 
BABIES ON THE LIMIT OF VIABILITY 
THEIR LUNG AND BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IS 
VERY IMMATURE AT TWENTY THREE WEEKS FORTY PER CENT OF 
BABIES DIE ON THE LABOUR WARD JUST 
BEFORE THE CUT OFF FOR ABORTION OF 
THE OF THE REMAINDER TWENTY SIX PER CENT SURVIVE 
HOSPITAL NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE 
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE BUT ABOVE THE ABORTION 
LIMIT AT TWENTY FOUR WEEKS THERE HAVE BEEN 
IMPROVEMENTS IN SURVIVAL FORTY SEVEN PER CENT WHO 
MAKE IT TO A NEO NATAL UNIT LIVE 
AND AT TWENTY FIVE WEEKS SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT SURVIVE 
NOAM WAS BORN SEVERELY PREMATURE AT 
TWENTY FOUR WEEKS FIVE DAYS ABOVE THE LEGAL 
CUT OFF FOR ABORTION 
HE WEIGHED LESS THAN TWO POUNDS 
BUT IS NOW DOING WELL 
I THINK IT HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS 
CHANGE JUST BECAUSE I CAN HOLD HIM 
NOW AND FEEL HIM AND WATCH HOW 
HE'S GROWING AND HE'S KICKING 
AROUND SO IT'S VERY GREAT 
THIS DOCTOR COLLATED DATA ON EVERY 
PREMATURE BIRTH IN ENGLAND IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
AND SAYS UNDER TWENTY FOUR WEEKS THERE'S 
BEEN NO MAJOR ADVANCE IN SURVIVAL 
IN MORE THAN A DECADE 
THESE LITTLE BABIES THEIR LUNGS 
ARE THAT BIT MORE IMMATURE IT'S 
THAT LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO 
ESTABLISH MILK FEEDS AND I THINK 
IT IS SIMPLY MORE DIFFICULT AND 
IT'S GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT TO 
ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS 
FOR THAT POPULATION 
PRO CHOICE GROUPS SAY THIS SURVIVAL 
DATA SUPPORTS THEIR ARGUMENT THAT 
THE ABORTION TIME LIMIT SHOULD NOT 
BE LOWERED 
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY 
PEOPLE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THE 
IDEA OF ALLOWING ABORTIONS BEYOND 
THE AGE OF OF VIABILITY AND I 
THINK THAT IT'S INTERESTING AND 
IMPORTANT THAT THE SCIENCE SUPPORTS 
THE TWENTY FOUR WEEK LIMIT 
MEDICAL IMAGING 
CAN SHOW FOETAL DEVELOPMENT IN MORE 
DETAIL THAN EVER 
M. P.'S WHO WANT TO CUT AN ABORTION IN 
TWENTY WEEKS SAY TECHNOLOGY IS HELPING 
MORE BABIES LIVE 
MORE BABIES SURVIVE UNDER TWENTY FOUR WEEKS 
WHEN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD NEO 
NATAL CARE AND WE KNOW THAT BABIES 
FEEL PAIN FROM PROBABLY AROUND SIXTEEN 
WEEKS ONWARDS AND THEREFORE 
BECAUSE OF OF VIABILITY AND FOETAL 
PAIN ISSUES THEN WE THINK IT'S 
APPROPRIATE THAT THE LIMIT IS NOW 
BROUGHT DOWN IN NINETEEN NINETY PARLIAMENT 
REDUCED THE ABORTION TIME LIMIT 
FROM TWENTY EIGHT TO TWENTY FOUR WEEKS AFTER EVIDENCE 
OF MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN FOETAL 
VIABILITY VIABILITY THIS NEW RESEARCH SHOWING NO 
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SURVIVAL 
BELOW TWENTY FOUR WEEKS MAY BE ENOUGH TO 
PERSUADE MANY M. P.'S ON A FREE VOTE TO 
LEAVE THE ABORTION LIMIT UNCHANGED 
COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
RICE CRISIS AS EVEN THE MOST BASIC 
STAPLES ARE BECOMING TOO EXPENSIVE 
FOR THE POOR 
AND PRINCE WILLIAM GETS HIS WINGS 
FROM HIS FATHER AND A BIG SMILE 
FROM KATE 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
OLYMPIC COMMITTEE HAS SAID HE 
BELIEVES THERE IS NO PUBLIC 
APPETITE FOR A BOYCOTT OF THE 
BEIJING GAMES AT THE END OF A 
WEEKS THAT'S BEEN MARRED BY PROTEST 
AGAINST THE OLYMPIC TORCH JACQUES 
ROGGE SAID HE'S INSISTED THE RELAY 
WILL GO ON AND WILL PASS THROUGH 
TIBET TODAY WITH ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN DAYS TO GO 
BEFORE THE GAMES OPEN IT WAS THE 
TURN OF ARGENTINA TO STAGE THE 
RELAY AMID TIGHT SECURITY RUNNERS 
CARRYING THE TORCH IN BUENOS AIRES 
THE ROUTE WAS LINED WITH ACTIVISTS 
OPPOSING CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS 
RECORD AND HUNDREDS OF CHINESE 
SUPPORTERS OF THE GAMES BUT IT 
PASSED LARGELY WITHOUT AN INCIDENT 
MEANWHILE CHINESE AUTHORITIES HAVE 
RELEASED WHAT THEY SAY IS NEW 
FOOTAGE OF LAST MONTH'S PRO TIBET 
DISTURBANCES MONKS AND OTHER 
PROTESTERS ARE SEEN ATTACKING 
BUILDINGS AND SETTING CARS ALIGHT 
IN THE GANSU REGION IN THE NORTH 
WEST OF THE COUNTRY 
A COUNCIL HAS USED LEGISLATION USED 
TO TRACK SUSPECTED CRIMINALS AND 
TERRORISTS TO SPY ON A FAMILY IT 
BELIEVED WAS CHEAT TO GO GET A 
SCHOOL PLACE WHILE THE FAMILY WAS 
IN THE END CLEARED POOLE COUNCIL 
SAID IT WAS JUSTIFIED IN USING 
UNDERCOVER CHECKS TO PROTECT THE 
INTERESTS OF OTHER PARENTS AND IT'S 
NOT THE FIRST TIME IT'S DONE IT 
ZBL NCHTS IS THEY WERE AN ORDINARY 
FAMILY LIVING ON AN ORDINARY NEAT 
BUT THEIR EVERY MOVE WAS BEING 
WATCHED WATCHED THIS IS PART OF THE LOG COMPILED BY 
POOLE COUNCIL 
WHO LIVED AT THE HOUSE AND WHERE 
WERE THEY GOING ONE OF THOSE 
DESTINATIONS WAS HERE THE LILLIPUT 
FIRST SCHOOL JUST UP THE ROAD FROM 
THE FASHIONABLE SANDBANKS AREA OF 
POOLE THE COUPLE HAD ONE CHILD 
HERE ALREADY AND THEY WANTED TO 
PLACE A SECOND AT THE SCHOOL 
BUT THEY HAD 
WAITED UNTIL A COUNCIL DEADLINE HAD 
PASSED BEFORE MOVING OUTSIDE THE 
CATCHMENT AREA 
IT WAS THAT ARRANGEMENT WHICH 
APPARENTLY SPARKED THE SURVEILLANCE 
OPERATION 
VERY SHOCKED AND I OPERATION DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS 
POSSIBLE 
WE HAVE PLAYED THE SYSTEM POSSIBLE 
TO AN EXTENT IN ORDER TO YOU KNOW 
GET OUR CHILD INTO SCHOOL 
DID YOU 
FEEL THAT WAS RIGHT 
NO I HAD SOME 
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE SOME 
UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS ABOUT THAT 
IN THAT WE HAVE TWO HOUSES AND 
WE'RE ABLE TO DO IT BUT IT'S NO 
DIFFERENT TO BEING ABLE TO CHOOSE 
TO BUY A HOUSE IN CATCHMENT AREA 
LILLIPUT'S SCHOOL'S CATCHMENT AREA 
COVERS DOZENS OF DESIRABLE 
RESIDENTIAL STREETS WITH A LARGE 
NUMBER OF EXPENSIVE WATERFRONT 
HOMES THE SCHOOL IS OFTEN 
OVERSUBSCRIBED DUE IN PART TO 
OUTSTANDING OFSTED RESULTS OTHER 
PARENTS WERE DIVIDED ON TODAY'S 
HEADLINES 
I THINK IT'S A BIT WEIRD HEADLINES THAT THE COUNCIL HAVE BEEN SPYING 
ON PEOPLE 
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT FAR 
FETCHED AND UNFAIR ROOM 
I THINK 
IT'S O. K. TO CHECK UP ON PEOPLE TO 
MAKE SURE THEY'RE TELLING THE TRUTH 
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO TELL 
LIES 
THE BOROUGH COUNCIL WHICH LIES USED ITS OWN STAFF TO CARRY OUT THE 
SURVEILLANCE AGREED THAT THE STAFF 
SCHOOL APPLICATION WAS IN ORDER 
BUT DENIES THAT IT USED 
DISPROPORTIONATE MEANS TO FIND OUT 
WHERE A SCHOOL IS HEAVILY OVER 
SUBSCRIBED AND WHERE THE MAIN 
CRITERIA FOR ENTRY IS LIVE IN THE 
CATCHMENT AREA THEN WE HAVE A DUTY 
TO MAKE SURE WHERE THERE IS A 
COMPLAINT OR CONCERN EXPRESSED BY 
SOMEBODY ELSE THAT THE APPLICATION 
HAS BEEN HONEST AND FAIR 
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION 
SAY USE OF THE LEGISLATION IN THIS 
CONTEXT IS UNUSUAL THOUGH NOT 
UNKNOWN TONIGHT POOLE COUNCIL 
SAID IT WOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE ANY 
LEGAL STEPS NECESSARY TO ENSURE 
THAT NO CHILD WAS UNJUSTLY 
PREVENTED FROM ATTENDING THE RIGHT 
SCHOOL

TWO DAYS OF RIOTING AND IN HAITI 
ANGRY DEMONSTRATORS CLASHED WITH

NOW OUTSTRIPPING SUPPLY 
AND IT'S PREDICTED THAT IN THE 
NEAR FUTURE THE CROP WILL CONTINUE 
TO GET MORE EXPENSIVE THE WORLD'S 
BIGGEST RICE IMPORTER THE 
PHILIPPINES IS STARTING TO SHOW 
REAL SIGNS OF A FOOD CRISIS FROM 
THERE JONATHAN HEAD REPORTS FROM 
THE CAPITAL MANILA 
RICE IS SO PRECIOUS IN THE 
PHILIPPINES IT GETS ITS OWN 
MILITARY EXPORT ESCORT THESE ARE 
TO BE SOLD BY THE GOVERNMENT AT A 
SUBSIDISED PRICE IT IS SUPPOSED TO 
SHOW THAT NO ONE WILL GO HUNGRY 
HERE BUT THAT MESSAGE IS NOT 
GETTING THROUGH EVERY DAY CROWDS 
THRONG THE DISTRIBUTION CENTRES 
GRABBING AT THE TICKETS THAT 
DETERMINE YOUR PLACE IN THE QUEUE 
FOR THE CHANCE TO BUY A RATION OF 
JUST THREE BANKS THREE BAGS 
THIS IS THE COUNTRY THIS IS A 
COUNTRY NOW ON THE BRINK OF FOOD 
PANIC AND NOT BECAUSE THERE IS A 
DANGER OF THE RICE RUNNING OUT BUT 
BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT HAS ALWAYS 
BEEN THE STAPLE DIET IS NOW 
BECOMING AN UNAFFORDABLE LUXURY 
WHEN YOU SPEND AT LEAST TWO THIRDS 
OF YOUR INCOME ON FOOD TODAY'S 
RICE PRICES REALLY HURT 
THE PRICE 
IS REALLY HIGH HERE YOU SEE THREE 
KILOS ONLY THAT IS WHY I AM HERE 
BECAUSE I 
HAVE MANY CHILDREN L. L. HAVE TWELVE CHILDREN 
SO WHY CAN'T THE 
PHILIPPINES FEED ITSELF ONE REASON 
IS THE FAILURE FOR MANY YEARS TO 
INVEST IN AGRICULTURE WITH 
IRRIGATION THESE PADDY FIELDS 
COULD PRODUCE THREE OR FOUR CROPS A 
YEAR INSTEAD OF JUST TWO AT 
GOVERNMENT WAREHOUSES THEY RACED 
TO SCOOP RICE INTO ONE KILO BAGS TO 
FEED THE HUNGRY QUEUES OUTSIDE

CEREMONY AT R. A. F. CRANWELL THE

FLYING OFFICER WILLIAM WALES DAY GRADUATING WITH A NUMBER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN 
WILLIAM RECEIVED HIS WINGS FROM HIS

HIS SPECIAL FOUR MONTH COURSE 
DURING WHICH SHE HAS LEARNED TO FLY 
FIXED WING AIRCRAFT AND HELICOPTERS 
DURING WHICH HE HAS LEARNED IT 
IS THE COMPLETION OF HIS LATEST 
PHASE OF MILITARY TRAINING FOR HER 
IT IS A RE EMERGENCE ON THE PUBLIC 
STAGE AND ALL THE EXPECTATIONS THAT 
AN APPEARANCE SUCH AS THIS ARE 
BOUND TO REKINDLE THE FOCUS SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN ON THE R. A. F. AND ON 
WILLIAM'S ABILITIES AS A PILOT 
LEARNING TO FLY HAS BEEN THE 
REALISATION OF A PERSONAL AMBITION 
AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS HE HAS BEEN 
POPULAR AND HAS DONE WELL 
ONCE HE 
JOINED US HE GOT STRAIGHT IN AND 
WAS TREATED LIKE ONE OF THE GUYS 
HE FITTED IN AND BONDED WITH US WE 
WERE HAPPY TO HAVE HIM L. THINK HE 
WAS HAPPY TO BE THERE AS WELL BUT BUT INEVITABLY THE IMAGE OF THE DAY IS 
NOT OF FLYING OFFICER WALES IN THE
