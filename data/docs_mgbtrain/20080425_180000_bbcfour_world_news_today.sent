LAMA IN THE COMING DAYS AFTER FIFTY 
YEARS OF CONDEMNATION DOES THIS 
SHOW A SHIFT IN POLICY BY BEIJING 
OR SHORT LIVED GESTURE POLITICS TO 
EASE PRESSURE AHEAD OF THE OLYMPICS 
SERB PROTESTS AFTER KOSOVO'S 
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENT HAS THE 
ANTI WEST PRO RUSSIAN MOOD HARDENED 
AHEAD OF ELECTIONS WE ASK THE 
FOREIGN MINISTER 
A NOVEL APPROACH TO THE FIGHT 
AGAINST DRUGS AND TERRORISM SOUTH 
KOREA SUCCESSFULLY CLONES THEIR 
MOST TALENTED SNIFFER DOG 
AND FOLLOWING THE INDIAN EXAMPLE 
CAN A RIVAL ENGLISH LEAGUE REALLY 
BOOST CRICKET'S WORLD FOLLOWING TO 
MAKE IT MORE POPULAR THAN FOOTBALL 
HELLO WELCOME THE DALAI LAMA'S 
SPOKESMAN SAYS CHINA'S OFFER OF 
TALKS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION IT'S CLEAR THAT BEIJING 
HAS MADE AT NOUPBSMENT IN THE FACE 
OF MOUNTING OPPOSITION TO ITS TIBET 
POLICY AHEAD OF THE OLYMPICS IN 
AUGUST WORLD LEADERS HAVE EXCUSED 
THEMSELVES FROM THE OPENING 
CEREMONY THE TORCH RAELY HAS AT 
TIMES BEEN REDUCED TO A FARCE IF 
THE TALKS GO AHEAD THERE'S DOUBT 
THEY'LL RESULT IN LONG LASTING 
CONCESSIONS WITH THE DALAI LAMA 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH ARRIVES IN JAPAN 
A BIT LIKE A VISITING HEAD OF STATE 
IT EVEN HAS ITS OWN RED CARPET BUT 
PRO TIBETAN DEMONSTRATORS ARE 
GETTING READY TO MAKE THEIR POINT 
AS WELL PROTESTERS HAVE ALREADY 
DISRUPTED THE TORCH RELAY IN LONDON 
PARIS AND OTHER CITIES CHINA 
ACCUSED THE DALAI LAMA OF TRYING TO 
SABOTAGE THE BEIJING OLYMPICS NO 
POINT IN EVEN TALK TO SUCH A MAN 
CHINA'S ALWAYS SAID UNTIL HE GIVES 
UP VIOLENCE BUT TONIGHT WITH A 
STRAIGHT FACE CHINA SIMPLY CHANGED 
TACK STATE T. V. SAYS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL NOW SIT DOWN WITH 
ONE OF THE DALAI LAMA'S ENVOYS 
IT IS HOPED THROUGH CONSULTATION THE DALAI LAMA'S SIDE 
WILL MOVE TO STOP PLOTTING INCITING 
VIOLENCE AND STOP DISRUPTING AND 
SABOTAGING THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
THAT'S A WELCOME PIECE OF NEWS FOR 
THESE VISITORS FROM THE EUROPEAN 
COMMISSION FOR WEEKS THE E. U. HAS 
CALLED ON CHINA TO HOLD TALKS WITH 
THE DALAI LAMA TONIGHT THE 
COMMISSION'S PRESIDENT GAVE US HIS 
FIRST REACTION TO THE NEWS TALKS TALKS DOES NOT MEAN AGREEMENT BUT IT 
REPRESENTS A VERY IMPORTANT 
PROGRESS I THINK IT'S FAIR TO 
RECOGNISE THAT 
WA KIND OF PROGRESS 
DOES THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WANT 
TO SEE FROM TALKS IT'S NOT JUST 
TWO PEOPLE SHAKING HANDS YOU WANT 
SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIVE WHILE WHILE RESPECTING FULLY THE INTEGRITY AND 
SOVEREIGNTY OF CHINA OVER TIBET 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE DIALOGUE FOR 
THE CULTURAL IDENTITY AND RELIGIOUS 
IDENTITY OF TIBET DIALOGUE FOR 
RESPECT FOR HOW MANY AN RIGHTS FOR FOR CHINA EUROPE IS IMPORTANT TWO 
DECADES AGO CHINA AND EUROPE TRADED 
ALMOST NOTHING BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SIX 
BILATERAL TRADE REACHED OVER TWO HUNDRED 
BILLION CHINA IS NOW EUROPE'S 
BIGGEST SOURCE OF MANUFACTURED 
IMPORTS WORTH OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION 
CHINA'S EUROPE'S FASTEST GROWING 
EXPORT MARKET MAKING FIFTY BILLION A 
YEAR 
WE NOW HAVE A VERY DEEP AND YEAR IRREVERSIBLE ECONOMIC 
INTERDEPENDENCE AND TRADE 
INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN CHINA AND 
EUROPE IT'S IN BOTH OUR INTERESTS 
FOR THIS RELATIONSHIP TO GO WELL 
BEIJING'S MOVE HAS GIVEN ITS 
EUROPEAN VISITORS SOMETHING TO TAKE 
HOME WITH THEM CHINA'S KEEN TO 
SHOW THE WEST IT IS TAKING POSITIVE 
STEPS WITHHOLDING TALKS IS ONE 
THING REACHING AGREEMENT WITH THE 
DALAI LAMA IS SOMETHING ENTIRELY 
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT WE CAN 
EXPECT FROM THE TALKS I SPOKE TO DOCTOR 
YIYI LU FROM CHATHAM HOUSE I ASKED 
IF SHE EXPECTED ANYTHING 
SUBSTANTIVE TO EMERGE 
I THINK WE 
CANNOT EXPECT ANY IMMEDIATE BIG 
RESULTS BECAUSE ACTUALLY IT IS A 
PROCESS A LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY 
DON'T REALISE IT'S NOT THE FIRST 
TIME THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS 
TALKING ABOUT THE DALAI LAMA 
THEY'VE HELD SIX ROUNDS OF TALKS IN 
THE PAST IT'S NOT AS IF THERE HAS 
BEEN NO DISCUSSION BEFORE THE 
PREVIOUS SIX ROUNDS OF TALKS SO FAR 
HAVEN'T YIELDED ANY MAJOR 
BREAKTHROUGH BUT IT'S GOING TO BE 
A LONG PROCESS IT'S THE 
REASSMUPTION OF TALKS I DON'T 
THINK WE SHOULD EXPECT ANY 
IMMEDIATE RESULT BUT IT'S 
BASICALLY THE PROCESS IS GOING 
AGAIN 
AS YOU SAY THERE HAVE BEEN AGAIN TALKS BEFORE BUT THE CHINESE SIDE 
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN REPRESENTED BY 
RELATIVELY JUNIOR OFFICIALS THIS 
TIME ROUND SURELY CHINA HAS TO 
PUT UP SOMEBODY MORE SERIOUS TO 
ENGAGE IN THE DIALOGUE EVERYTHING EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE IT DEPENDS ON HOW IT 
DEVELOPS I MEAN THEY CAN START 
WITH A RELATIVELY JUNIOR LEVEL 
OFFICIALS AND IF IT GOES WELL THEY 
CAN TAKE IT TO HIGHER LEVELS IN 
TERMS OF WHO COMES OUT AND WHO 
ATTENDS THESE MEETINGS THESE ARE 
VERY FLEXIBLE ISSUES 
GIVE US AN 
IDEA OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT ARE 
GOING TO BE ON THE TABLE IN THESE 
TALKS 
I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEAR TALKS THAT THE DALAI LAMA AND HIS SORT OF 
GOVERNMENT IN THE PAST THEY PUT 
FORWARD THESE DEMANDS WHICH IS 
BASICALLY SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR 
BEIJING TO ACCEPT I THINK NOT JUST 
THE GOVERNMENT ORDINARY CHINESE 
PEOPLE THEY FEEL THAT THOSE DEMANDS 
ARE SIMPLY NOT REALISTIC 
WHAT ARE 
THOSE DEMANDS 
IN PARTICULAR THEY 
ASK THAT THE THEY ASK FOR A HIGH 
DEGREE OF AUTONOMY NOT JUST FOR THE 
TURNT TIBET THE AREA THAT'S 
CURRENTLY TIBET BUT ASK FOR A 
BROADER REGION THERE ARE OTHER 
REGIONS IN CHINA WHERE THERE ARE 
TIBETAN POLL LAIGS BUT THERE ARE 
OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS THEY WANT THIS 
GREATER TIBET WHICH ACTUALLY IF 
YOU GO ALONG WITH THEIR DEMAND IT 
ACTUALLY GO INTO TAKE UP ABOUT A 
QUARTER OF THE ENTIRE TERRITORY OF 
CHINA SO THAT IS A DEMAND PEOPLE 
ARE UNABLE TO ACCEPT BECAUSE IN 
THESE OTHER AREAS THERE ARE MANY 
OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS THEY ALSO LIVE 
THERE SOME OTHER DEMANDS WHICH ARE 
SIMPLY UNREALISTIC INCLUDING MAYBE 
THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY CHINESE 
MILITARY PRESENCE IN TIBET I THINK 
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT SOMETHING THAT 
CAN BE ACCEPTED BY EITHER THE 
CHINESE GOVERNMENT FOR THE CHINESE 
POPULATION AT LARGE 
CHINA ANALYST DOCTOR YIYI LU TALK TO ME 
EARLIER EARLIER NOW LET'S LOCK AT SOME OF THE DAY'S 
OTHER NEWS AT LEAST TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE HAVE

BUYING OF FUEL 
NOW SERBIA HAS FOUND THE UNILATERAL 
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE BY 
KOSOVO A BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW 
MOST MAJOR WORLD GOVERNMENTS 
INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND 
MAJOR E. U. STATES RECOGNISE KOSOVO'S 
DECISION IN FEBRUARY SERBIA 
BACKED BY ITS KEY ALLY RUSSIA 
STILL MAINTAINS THAT THE MOVE IS 
ILLEGAL THE DISPUTE OVER KOSOVO IS 
SEEN AS BOLSTERING THE PRO MOSCOW 
NATIONALISTS IN NEXT MONTH'S 
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS AT THE 
EXPENSE PERHAPS OF THE MORE PRO 
WESTERN DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF 
PRESIDENT BORIS TADIC 
CELEBRATING THE BIRTH OF A NEW 
NATION THESE WERE THE SCENES IN 
THE CAPITAL PRISTINA WHEN KOSOVO 
DECLARED INDEPENDENCE IN MID 
FEBRUARY NINETY PER CENT OF ITS PEOPLE ARE 
ETHNIC ALBANIA THEY TOOK TO THE 
STREETS IN BUOYANT MOOD THE 
MINORITY SERBS WEREN'T CELEBRATING 
IN MITROVICA THERE WERE PROTESTS 
IN SERBIA PROPER THE BREAKAWAY 
SPARKED RIOTS SERBIA'S 
NATIONALISTS SOUGHT TO GAIN 
POLITICAL CAPITAL FROM THE ANGER 
THEY CALLED ON SERBS TO LOOK EAST 
TO RUSSIA NOT TO THE WEST THE 
PROSPECT OF JOINING THE EUROPEAN 
UNION IS A CARROT THAT'S BEING 
DANGLED TO SOOTHE NATIONALIST FER 
VOR BRUSSELS WANTS BELGRADE TO 
SOIN AN AGREEMENT PAVING THE WAY 
FOR FUTURE MEMBERSHIP BEFORE SERBIA 
HOLDS PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN 
TWO WEEKS BUT THE SERBIAN 
GOVERNMENT UNDER THE PRIME MINISTER 
VOJISLAV KOSTUNICA HAS INDICATED 
THAT SUCH AGREEMENT WOULD NOT SERVE 
BELGRADE'S NATIONAL INTERESTS IT 
BELIEVES THIS WOULD BE USED AS A 
BARRING NIP BARGAINING CHIP 
SOMETHING IT SAYS IT WILL NEVER 
ACCEPT ACCEPT WE'RE JOINED NOW BY SERBIA'S 
FOREIGN MINISTER VUK JEREMIC MR. 
JEREMIC WHY DOESN'T SERBIA STOP 
LOOKING BACKWARDS LOOK FORWARD NOW 
AND ACCEPT KOSOVO IS NO LONGER PART 
OF YOUR COUNTRY 
ACTUALLY KOSOVO IS 
VERY MUCH A PART OF SERBIA ACCORD 
TO OUR CONSTITUTION ACCORDING TO 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL THEY CAN'T 
JUST DECLARE INDEPENDENCE 
UNILATERALLY IN DEFIANCE OF 
INTERNATIONAL LAW YOU MAY HAVE 
POWERFUL SPONSORS FOR THIS ILL 
LEGITIMATE DECISION THERE IS 
INTERNATIONAL LAW UNITED NATIONS 
SERBIA IS USING ALL ITS DIPLOMATIC 
RESOURCES HAVING RENOUNCED THE USE 
OF FORCE SERBIA IS USING 
DIPLOMATIC RESOURCES AS WELL AS 
POLITICAL AND LEGAL TO PREVENT THIS 
ILL LEGITIMATE DECLARATION RUSSIA RUSSIA WHICH IS A PERMANENT MEMBER OF THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL IS BLOCKING UN 
RECOGNITION OF KOSOVO AS AN 
INDEPENDENT STATE DE FACTO IT IS 
SO MANY COUNTRIES ROUND THE WORLD 
SAY KOSOVO IS NO LONGER PART OF 
SERBIA WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET REAL 
THREE QUARTERS OF THE COUNTRIES 
ROUND THE WORLD DO NOT RECOGNISE 
KOSOVO IT'S NOT JUST RUSSIA AS A 
PERMANENT MEMBER OF THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL IT'S ALSO CHINA WHEN ONE 
TALKS ABOUT OTHER MEMBER THAT'S ARE 
IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS WE'RE TALKING INDIA 
BRAZIL ARGENTINA SOUTH AFRICA 
INDONESIA ACTUALLY THREE QUARTERS 
OF THE WORLD COUNTRIES ARE REFUSE 
TO RECOGNISE KOSOVO 
YOU'RE BEING 
ENERGETIC AT THE MOMENT IN 
DIPLOMACY YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT 
SERBIA'S CASE ARE YOU HAVING 
SUCCESS 
ACTUALLY I THINK THAT OUR SUCCESS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL SO FAR 
ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF COUNTRIES 
VERY FEW COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE 
TRANSATLANTIC FAMILY OF NATIONS 
HAVE ACTUALLY RECOGNISED KOSOVO WE 
HAVE PREVENTED KOSOVO FROM ACCEDE 
ING TO ANY INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANISATION WE'RE HOPE TO 
CULMINATE OUR EFFORTS DURING THE 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PUT 
FORWARD A SIMPLE RESOLUTION WE 
WANT TO SAY THE FOLLOWING KOSOVO 
DECLARED INDEPENDENCE AGAINST THE 
DECISION OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
HAS THIS HAPPENED IN LINE WITH 
INTERNATIONAL LAW WE WANT TO PUT 
THIS MOTION IN FRONT OF THE GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY SO THEY CAN FORWARD THIS 
TO THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF 
JUSTICE THIS IS THE ULTIMATE 
DECISION 
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH DECISION LEGAL CHANNEL 
WE'RE GOING THROUGH 
DIPLOMATIC AND LEGAL CHANNELS WE WE SAW A GLIMPSE AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THIS PROGRAMME ABOUT THOSE ANGRY 
PROTESTS THAT TOOK PLACE IN 
FEBRUARY IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH 
OF KOSOVO'S DECLARATION OF 
INDEPENDENCE ARE PEOPLE STILL VERY 
ANGRY IN SERBIA 
PEOPLE ARE VERY 
ANXIOUS PEOPLE ARE VERY ANGRY 
THEY BELIEVE THIS WAS DONE IN 
BLATANT DEFIANCE OF INTERNATIONAL 
LAW AND OF COURSE THE DEMOCRATIC 
CONSTITUTION OF SERBIA SO SERBIA 
IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY ON THIS ONE 
IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THERE'S 
PEACE IN THE REGION THEY'RE NOT 
GOING TO USE FORCE LIKE EVERY 
OTHER COUNTRY WOULD DO WE'RE GOING 
TO EXPLORE ALL AVENUES TO PROTECT 
ITS SOVEREIGNTY RESTORE INTEGRITY 
AND DIGNITY 
IS IT HARDENING THE 
NATIONALIST MOOD AMONGST SERBIANS 
THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY THAT THE 
KOSOVO DISPUTE PLAYS INTO THE HANDS 
OF THE RADICALS AT THE EXPENSE OF 
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF BORIS TADIC 
OF WHICH YOU'RE A MEMBER WE'RE WE'RE HAVING AN IMPORTANT PARLIAMENTARY 
ELECTION ON MAY ELEVENTH THIS IS REALLY 
WATER SHED ELECTION IT WOULD NOT 
BE AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THIS 
WOULD BE A REFERENDUM IN EUROPE ON 
WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE THE 
PROCESS OF JOINING THE EUROPEAN 
UNION WHEN IT COMES TO KOSOVO 
THERE IS ACTUALLY NOT MUCH 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PARTIES THAT 
ARE COMPETE ANYTHING THESE 
ELECTIONS WE'RE ALL UNITED AS A 
NATION ON THIS ONE 
YOU'RE MORE 
PRO EUROPEAN UNION AREN'T YOU 
ISN'T IT THE CASE THAT IF SERBIA 
JUST SAID LOOK WE'LL RECOGNISE 
KOSOVO SIGN YOUR AGREEMENTS AND 
DOWN THE LINE YOU CAN JOIN THE 
EUROPEAN UNION 
I JUST HOPE THAT 
SERBIA IS NEVER GOING TO GO PUT IN 
FRONT OF SUP A IT'S NOT GOING TO 
BE PRESENTED WITH SUCH AN INDECENT 
PROPOSAL 
YOU KNOW THAT'S THE PROPOSAL IMPLICATION THE CARROT IS BEING 
DANGLED 
I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS DANGLED GOING TO BE ASKED THERE ARE 
COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 
SAYING LOUD AND CLEAR WE'RE NOT 
RECOGNISING KOSOVO IF THE MEMBERS 
OF THE CLUB ARE NOT ASKED TO 
RECOGNISE HOW CAN AN OUTSIDE 
MEMBER ASKED THAT 
IS THIS QUAY 
AGREEMENT THE STABILISATION 
AGREEMENT GOING TO BE SIGNED BY THE 
SERBIAN GOVERNMENT 
THE SERBIAN 
GOVERNMENT IS READY TO SIGN IT 
TOMORROW THE HOPE THE EUROPEAN 
UNION WILL BE READY TOO 
VUK JEREMIC THANK YOU 
NOW LET'S TURN TO A GROUND BREAKING 
MOVE IN SOUTH KOREA MOST OF US 
KNOW THAT SNIFFER DOGS ARE A VITAL 
PART OF THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG 
SMUGGLING AND TERRORISM BUT 
THEY'RE EXPENSIVE TO TRAIN AND NOT 
EVERY DOG IS UP TO THE JOB SOUTH 
KOREA HAS COME UP WITH A NOVEL 
SOLUTION IT'S TAKEN ITS BEST 
SNIFFER DOG AND CLONED IT CREATING 
SEVEN GENETICALLY IDENTICAL PUPPIES 
THIS BUNDLE OF LIFE AND ENERGY IS 
REMARKABLE PROOF THAT SOUTH KOREA 
IS STILL BOUND AGO HEAD IN THE 
FIELD OF GENETIC TECHNOLOGY THESE 
PUPPIES ARE CLONES MADE FROM CELLS 
HARVESTED FROM A WORKING SNIFFER 
DOG D. N. A. TESTS HAVE SHOWN THEY ARE 
IDENTICAL TO THE ORIGINAL FOR THE 
CUSTOMS SERVICE THIS IS ABOUT 
SAVING MONEY A NATURALLY BORN 
PUPPY HAS JUST A THIRTY PER CENT CHANCE OF 
DEMONSTRATING THE SKILLS NECESSARY 
TO BECOME A FULLY FLEDGED SNIFFER 
DOG FOR THE TWO THIRDS THAT DON'T 
MAKE IT THAT MEANS MONTHS OF 
WASTED TRAINING FOR THESE DOGS 
EXACT GENETIC COPIES OF THE 
SERVICE'S BEST SNIFFER DOG THE 
CHANCES ARE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED 
THIS IS WHERE THE CLONING TOOK 
PLACE THE SAME LABORATORY THAT 
CREATED THE WORLD'S FIRST CLONED 
DOG THREE YEARS AGO HERE LIFE 
BEGINS NOT BY SEXUAL REPRODUCTION 
BUT THE MANIPULATION OF CELL TISSUE 
UNDER A MICROSCOPE 
WE ARE NOT TRYING TIME PROVE ON NATURE BUT WE CAN USE 
THIS TECHNOLOGY TO CURE HUMAN 
ILLNESSES AND TO GATHER NEW 
SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE 
DOCTOR LEE'S 
LATEST EXPERIMENT SEEMS TO PROVE 
THAT THE HIGHLY REFINED QUALITIES 
NEEDED FOR THIS CANINE DETECTIVE 
WORK ARE INHERITED TRAITS THE 
CLONED PUPPIES SHOW THE SAME SKILL 
AS THE DOG FROM WHICH THEY WERE 
CREATED IN THE TESTS SO FAR WE 
HAVE FOUND THAT ALL SEVEN DOGS HAVE 
THE CORE BASIC APTITUDE TO BECOME 
GOOD SNIFFER DOGS THEIR TRAINER 
SAYS THE FIRST EVER CLONED DOG IS 
STILL GOING STRONG BUT IT'S AN 
EXPENSIVE AND CONTROVERSIAL SCIENCE 
LESS THAN ONE IN FIFTY IMPLANTED 
EMBRYOS RESULTS IN A HEALTHY BIRTH 
THESE PUPPIES THOUGH WONTS BE THE 
LAST HERE IN SOUTH KOREA A PROJECT 
TO CLONE PET DOGS COMER SMALLY IS 
UNDER WAY 
COMMERCIALLY IS UNDER WAY 
NOW CAN A FAST PACED SHORTER 
VERSION OF CRICKET OVERTAKE 
FOOTBALL AS THE WORLD'S LEADING 
TEAM SPORT THAT'S THE VISION OF A 
TEXAN BILLIONAIRE WHO RECKONS 
T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY CRICKET WHERE EACH TEAM 
BATS AND BOWLS FOR JUST TWENTY OVERS 
COULD BE THE NEXT GREAT MONEY 
SPINNER IF MARKETED CORRECTLY SIR 
ALLEN STANFORD SAID AN ENGLISH 
RIVAL VERSION OF THE INDIAN PREMIER 
LEAGUE WOULD BE WORTH AT LEAST ONE DOLLAR 
BILLION BILLION T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY NOT TEST CAN BECOME THE 
TEAM SPORT OF THE WORLD REPLACING 
SOCCER I THINK IT CAN BECOME IT 
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE THE MOST 
POPULAR TEAM SPORT IN THE WHOLE 
WORLD IN MAYBE LESS THAN TEN YEARS 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A HIGHLY 
ORGANISED STRUCTURED EFISHENTS 
MANAGEMENT TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS TO 
RUN THIS SHOW THAT'S WHY I'M 
PUTTING ALL MY SUPPORT AND 
INVESTMENT IF I'M ASKED TO 
INVESTMENT WITH THE ENGLISH BEHIND 
THE E. C. B. THEY'RE THE ONLY LOGICAL 
CHOICE AND I LOOK AT A LOT OF 
BUSINESSES TO INVEST IN NOT JUST 
CRICKET I'M HUGELY IMPRESSED WITH 
THEIR ORGANISATIONAL CAPACITY AND 
HOW THEY RUN THEIR SHOP 
SIR ALLEN 
STANFORD SO A REALISTIC PROSPECT 
OR HOLLOW VISION BRIAN GLANVILLE 
IS A FOOTBALL WRIELTER WRITING FOR 
WORLDSOCCER.COM AND DUNCAN STEER 
FROM SPIN CRICKET MAGAZINE COULD 
T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY CRICKET BECOME THE WORLD'S 
FAVOURITE TEAM SPORT 
I THINK SIR 
ALLEN STANFORD IS PROVING IF YOU'VE 
MADE BILLIONS OF POUNDS DOING 
SOMETHING YOU THINK ANYTHING CAN 
HAPPEN IT'S POSSIBLE MAYBE THE 
WORLD IS A BIG PLACE AMERICA 
THOUGH WHICH MAYBE IS WHAT'S 
COMING TO THE FOREFRONT OF HIS MIND 
THEY LIKE EP SODDIC SPORTS THERE 
THAT TAKE A LONG TIME BASEBALL 
AMERICAN FOOTBALL SOCCER HASN'T 
TAKEN OFF THERE AT THIS STAGE 
THERE'S NO REASON WHY CRICKET 
T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY CRICKET COULDN'T BECOME 
VERY POPULAR THERE 
HOW LONG DO YOU 
THINK IT WOULD TAKE TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY THIRTY 
YEARS 
IT'S TAKEN SOCCER FORTY YEARS YEARS AND IT HASN'T DONE S. T. P. 
IT'S ABOUT 
TIME THAT FOOTBALL GOT A RUN FROM 
ITS MONEY ISN'T IT 
IT WON'T GET IT 
FROM CRICKET I HAVE A GREAT 
AFFECTION FOR CRICKET TEND TO 
FORGET QUICKLY ALL THE SATURDAY 
PREMIERSHIP GAMES I REPORT FOR THE 
SUNDAY TIMES BUT I STILL REMEMBER 
THE FIRST CRICKET GAME I EVER SAW 
I WAS TEN YEARS OLD IT WAS AT 
LORD'S MY GREAT HERO DENIS COMPTON 
CATCHING OUT THE FAMOUS WICKET 
KEEPER GODFREY EVANS ON THE 
BOUNDARY I WISH CRICKET WERE I 
HATE TO SEE ITS DEMISE I HATE TO 
SEE THE DEMISE OF THE COUNTY 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
YOU'RE WRITING IT CHAMPIONSHIP OFF 
THIS FELLOW IT REMINDS ME OF OFF THE REMARK MAKING MONEY HAS NOTHING 
TO DO WITH INTELLIGENCE THE IRISH 
SAY HE'S AWAY WITH THE FAIRIES 
ACTUALLY THE FUNNY THING IS THAT 
HISTORICALLY AS WE BOTH KNOW THE 
FIRST EVER TOUR BY THE MARYLEBONE 
CRICKET CLUB IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
WAS IN AMERICA CRICKET WAS A POP 
ALREADY GAME IT WAS OVERTAKEN THE 
POINT ABOUT SPORT IN AMERICA 
THEY'RE PUTTING TWO FINGERS UP AT 
EUROPE THEY HAVE AMERICAN FOOTBALL 
BUT THAT IS RUGBY WITH NOBODYS ON 
BASEBALL IS ROUNDERS WITH NOBODYS 
ON THEY DON'T WANT IT DUNCAN DUNCAN STEER 
I DON'T KNOW IF HE IS AWAY STEER WITH THE FAIRIES OR NOT THAT'S A 
MATTER FOR HIS DOCTOR IN INDIA TWENTY FIVE 
YEARS AGO CRICKET WASN'T A RELIGION 
NOW IT'S THE CLICHE THAT CRICKET IS 
INDIA'S BIG RELIGION WINNING THE 
WORLD CUP IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE POPULARISED THAT 
THE ECONOMY GREW A MIDDLE CLASS 
CAME N. IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THAT 
HAVEN'T BEEN GRIPPED BY 
PROFESSIONAL SPORTS HAVEN'T BEEN 
GRIPPED BY COMMERCIAL AISLESED 
PROFESSIONAL SPORT I KNOW CHINA IS 
LOOKING INTO CRICKET SERIOUSLY IF 
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SAYS OUR 
KIDS ARE GOING TO PLAY CRICKET 
THEN THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY CRICKET 
WILL THE AMERICANS IN ORDER TO 
BECOME A COMMERCIAL SUCCESS YOU 
HAVE TO HIT IT BIG IN THE UNITED 
STATES 
LOOK AT THE INDIAN PREMIER STATES LEAGUE THERE'S A ONE BILLION DOLLAR T. V. 
CONTRACT FROM SONY THERE IT'S A 
BIG ISSUE THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD 
ECONOMY COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA AND 
CHINA ARE GOING TO BE WORTH A LOT 
MORE IN THE FUTURE I'M NOT AN 
EXPERT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE BIGGER THAN AMERICA 
BUT YOU HAVE TO LOCK AT THE 
DEVELOPING ECONOMIES 
YOU SAID SIR 
ALLEN STANFORD IS AWAY WITH THE 
FAIRIES BUT HE IS PUTTING A LOT OF 
MONEY INTO IT SURELY THERE IS MUCH 
MORE MONEY IN CRICKET 
IT SHOWS HE 
IS AWAY WITH THE FAIRIES THERE'S THERE'S MORE MONEY IN CRICKET THAN HAS BEEN 
EXPLOITED 
IN INDIA CRICKET TOTALLY EXPLOITED OVERSHADOWS SOCCER THE FUNNY THING 
IS THE INDIANS ARE SOCCER MAD THEY 
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT UNFORTUNATELY 
THEY CAN'T PLAY IT CRICKET IS 
ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT THERE IT WILL 
GO ON BEING SO THERE'S NO CHANCE 
OF CRICKET TAKING ROOT NOW IN THE 
UNITED STATES WILL THEY PLAY IT IN 
CHINA I DOUBT IT I'M NOT ENTIRELY 
PLEASED THAT SOCCER IS SO 
ABSOLUTELY PREEMINENT AS A SPORT 
ALL OVER THE WORLD IN MANY WAYS AS 
A MORAL MORASS NOT LEAST HERE IF 
YOU LOOK AT F. I. F. A. I WON'T SAY IT'S 
A DEN OF THIEVES BECAUSE THAT YOU YOU CAN'T SAY THAT
