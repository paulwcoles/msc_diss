IS IT VESUVIUS IT SEEMS SO UNCLE 
MASTER 
MASTER WAKE UP WHAT 
GIVE ME YOUR HAND 
WE CAN'T STAY HERE WE HAVE TO GO 
EVERYONE MUST MOVE FROM HERE 
STAYING OR GOING BOTH ARE EQUALLY DANGEROUS 
ARE WE GOING TO DIE NO WE'RE TRAPPED 
TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE ROMAN EMPIRE THE GREATEST EMPIRE THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN 
WAS SHAKEN TO ITS CORE 
BY THE WORST NATURAL DISASTER TO STRIKE THE ANCIENT WORLD 
IN LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE CITY OF POMPEII AND FIVE THOUSAND OF ITS PEOPLE 
WERE WIPED FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH 
THEIR KILLER WAS THE VOLCANO MOUNT VESUVIUS 
BUT HOW IT DESTROYED THEM AND WHY SO MANY DIED WAS FOR A LONG TIME 
A MYSTERY 
TODAY POMPEII LIES IN RUINS 
BUT AMID THE CRUMBLING WALLS AND THE FADED PAINTINGS TANTALISING CLUES HAVE BEEN UNEARTHED 
CASTS OF VICTIMS BURIED IN THE ASH PRESERVE THEIR DYING MOMENTS 
PRECIOUS OBJECTS TELL INTIMATE DETAILS OF THEIR LIVES 
AND THE WRITINGS OF A YOUNG MAN WHO WATCHED IT HAPPEN EXPOSE THE FULL HORROR OF WHAT KILLED THEM 
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE 
FROM THIS EVIDENCE WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THE INTERTWINING LIVES OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE OF POMPEII 
AND TELL THE CHILLING AND STARTLING STORY OF THEIR LAST EVER DAY 
POMPEII LIES IN THE SHADOW OF MOUNT VESUVIUS 
BUT THIS VOLCANO HAS BEEN QUIET FOR OVER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS 
THE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S A VOLCANO 
THE TWENTY FOURTH OF AUGUST AD SEVENTY NINE STARTS LIKE ANY OTHER DAY 
THE TEMPLE WILL BE RESTORED FATHER WE DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD NIGHT 
JULIUS POLYBIUS IS ONE OF POMPEII'S WEALTHIER RESIDENTS 
CAREFUL WITH THAT SORRY I'M LATE MY DAUGHTER IS SICK WITH CRAMPS 
IS SHE PREGNANT TOO SHE'S SEVEN SIR 
GO 
SLEEP NOW 
THIS IS THE ROOM 
ON THAT MORNING HE WAS PREPARING TO REDECORATE HIS FRONT ROOM 
OUTSIDE A SLOGAN ON HIS WALL TELLS US HE HAD POLITICAL AMBITIONS 
I WANT IT COMPLETELY REDONE YOU CAN MANAGE IT BEFORE THE ELECTION 
OF COURSE I WANT TO ENTERTAIN MY SPONSORS IN HERE 
I ONLY HOPE YOU CAN SLEEP WITH ALL THIS WORK GOING ON 
SLEEP WILL BE NO PROBLEM MOTHER 
POLYBIUS'S DAUGHTER JULIA IS SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT 
HER CONDITION WILL DETERMINE THE WHOLE FAMILY'S FATE 
MINOR EARTH TREMORS PLAGUE THE CITY 
THAT VESUVIUS IS STIRRING 
BUT NONE OF THE TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE CAN READ THE SIGNS 
GLADIATORS ARE THE SPORTING HEROES OF THEIR TIME AND FREE TO ROAM THE STREETS 
ARDENT FANS SCRAWL LOVE NOTES ON CITY WALLS 
WHERE HERE 
CELADUS THE THRACIAN IS ALL THE GIRLS' 
HEART THROB 
LIFE WOULD SOON CHANGE FOR EVER 
BUT FOR NOW THEY CONCENTRATE ON DOING WHAT THEY DO BEST MAKING MONEY 
COME ON HURRY IT UP 
THIS BUSINESS IS RUN ON HUMAN URINE IT'S SO VALUABLE THE EMPEROR EVEN PUT A TAX ON IT 
IT'S A FULLERY CLOTHES ARE BROUGHT HERE TO BE CLEANED 
THEY USE URINE BECAUSE THE ACID GETS RID OF GREASE STAINS 
IT'S THE SLAVES OF COURSE WHO DO THE DIRTY WORK 
THE REMAINS OF AT LEAST A DOZEN FULLERIES HAVE BEEN FOUND HERE 
DON'T LET THEM TAKE ADVANTAGE THEY WILL TRY EVERY TRICK TO AVOID AN HONEST DAY'S WORK 
WHEN WILL YOU BE BACK 
WHEN I'VE FINISHED MY BUSINESS 
TRY NOT TO LOOK SO SCARED FORTUNATA YOU'RE THE WIFE OF STEPHANUS NOW 
WHEN YOU SPEAK THEY HEAR ME 
SLAVES DO ALL THE CHORES 
EVEN SLEEPING WITH THEIR MASTERS 
THE LAND AROUND POMPEII IS FERTILE 
RICH WITH MINERALS SPEWED OUT BY THE VOLCANO THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE 
BUT THE GIVER OF LIFE ALSO BRINGS DEATH 
DEEP BENEATH THE GROUND 
THROUGH A WEAK SPOT IN THE EARTH'S CRUST MOLTEN ROCK OR MAGMA LEAKS 
A THICK PLUG OF ROCK IN THE NECK OF THE VOLCANO BLOCKS ITS EXIT 
AS THE UNDERGROUND POOL OF MAGMA GROWS SO THE EXPLOSIVE PRESSURE MOUNTS 
THE LAND SWELLS AND EARTH TREMORS BECOME MORE FREQUENT 
TROUBLE IS BREWING IN PARADISE 
TWO DAYS STEPHANUS 
AS SOON AS I TAKE DELIVERY YES YOU HAVE MY WORD GOOD 
UNTIL THEN 
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR 
YOUR BRACELET HEDONE WHAT DOES IT SAY 
WHAT DOES IT SAY 
FROM THE MASTER TO HIS SLAVE GIRL 
DON'T FRET SABINUS A FIRST CHILD IS ALWAYS THE HARDEST ON A MOTHER BUT JULIA IS YOUNG AND HEALTHY 
YOU'LL HAVE MANY MORE THE GODS WILLING 
AROUND ONE P. M. ON THE TWENTY FOURTH OF AUGUST AD SEVENTY NINE VESUVIUS ROARS BACK TO LIFE 
TRAPPED IN A SUPERHEATED PRESSURE CAULDRON FOR ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS 
THE MOLTEN ROCK HAS TURNED NOT TO LAVA BUT TO FOAM 
EJECTED AT SUPERSONIC SPEED IT FORMS A CHURNING COLUMN 
THAT RISES INTO THE SKY 
THE PEOPLE OF POMPEII HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE 
THERE IS NO WORD IN LATIN FOR VOLCANO 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENING MANY WHO COULD FLEE STAY 
PERHAPS WE SHOULD GO BACK TO BARRACKS OR THE TEMPLE NOT BEFORE YOU BUY ME THAT DRINK 
LOOK IT'S JUST SMOKE 
BACK TO WORK IF THE MASTER GETS BACK AND THIS ISN'T FINISHED 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN IT'S A SIGN FROM THE GODS 
JUST WORK 
JUST MINUTES AFTER THE ERUPTION THE COLUMN OF SUPERHEATED ROCK AND GAS 
HAS CLIMBED FIFTEEN KILOMETRES INTO THE SKY 
IT'S EASILY VISIBLE ACROSS THE BAY IN MISENUM 
HOME TO ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO MIGHT UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON 
PLEASE MASTER YES YES 
I'M COMING WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT I MUST BE DISTURBED FROM MY WRITING 
WE THOUGHT YOU'D WANT TO SEE THIS BROTHER 
INDEED 
GAIUS PLINIUS SECUNDUS OR PLINY THE ELDER IS COMMANDER OF THE ROMAN NAVY 
IS IT COMING FROM THE MOUNTAIN IT SEEMS SO UNCLE BUT HIS REAL PASSION IS STUDYING NATURE 
ANYCATUS ORDER A BOAT READY 
BUT IT'S HIS NEPHEW GAIUS WHO'LL ONE DAY PROVIDE THE VITAL CLUES TO UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE EVENT 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING I WANT TO SEE IT FROM THE HILLTOP THEN MORE CLOSELY FROM THE SEA 
IT'S LIKE AN UMBRELLA PINE EXACTLY EXACTLY EXTRAORDINARY 
THE TOP OF THE COLUMN LOSES ITS UPWARD THRUST AS IT CLIMBS AND THEN CRAWLS ACROSS THE SKY 
NORMALLY THERE'S AN OFFSHORE WIND THAT WOULD FORCE THE COLUMN OF ASH OUT ACROSS THE BAY 
BUT NOT TODAY INSTEAD THE WIND DRIVES THE CLOUD DIRECTLY OVER POMPEII 
STEALING ITS DAYLIGHT AND PLUNGING IT INTO A LIVING NIGHTMARE 
FATHER I DON'T FEEL WELL GO BACK INSIDE ALL GO BACK INSIDE 
THEY DO NOT KNOW IT BUT THE DECISIONS THEY MAKE NOW WILL ULTIMATELY SEAL THEIR FATE 
MASTER MASTER 
MASTER WAKE UP WHAT 
WHAT TIME IS IT WHY DIDN'T YOU WAKE ME IT'S DAY 
BUT THE SUN HAS GONE WHAT IS IT AN ECLIPSE 
THAT SOUND WE HEARD THE THUNDER PERHAPS IT IS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT I MUST GET BACK 
TELL HIM HE MUST COME BACK AT ONCE BUT MISTRESS GO HURRY 
DON'T STOP MISTRESS IT'S DARK 
THEN WE'LL LIGHT MORE LAMPS GO ON PHOEBE LIGHT THE LAMPS 
AND QUICKLY 
AS THE CLOUD OF ASH OBSCURES THE SUN DAY TURNS TO NIGHT 
BUT THERE'S WORSE TO COME 
PROPELLED HIGH INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THE BOILING ROCK MIXES WITH AIR COOLS SOLIDIFIES 
AND THEN BEGINS TO FALL 
WE SHOULD GO 
YES IT TAKES ABOUT HALF AN HOUR FOR THE FALL OUT TO REACH POMPEII 
COOLED BUT STILL FULL OF AIR THE MAGMA HAS FORMED PUMICE STONES 
PEBBLES 
IT'S LIGHT 
IT FLOATS 
BUT MIXED IN WITH THE PUMICE IS SOMETHING MUCH MORE DEADLY 
COME ON WE CANNOT BE FRIGHTENED OF PEBBLES WE ARE GLADIATORS 
COLD DENSE ROCKS HAVE BEEN TORN FROM THE INSIDE OF THE VOLCANO 
FALLING AT TWO HUNDRED KILOMETRES PER HOUR THEY STRIKE WITH DEADLY FORCE 
ONE HOUR AFTER THE ERUPTION HAS BEGUN THE CRISIS IS DEEPENING 
THOUSANDS TAKE TO THE STREETS AND FLEE 
WE CAN'T STAY HERE WE HAVE TO GO 
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS I'M SURE THE MISTRESS WILL BE SAFE 
NO DOUBT BUT WHAT ABOUT MY MONEY 
THIS IS THE TIME FOR DECISIVE ACTION 
SLAVES ARE EXPECTED TO PROTECT THEIR MASTERS' LIVES AND PROPERTY 
BUT AS FEAR AND PANIC SPREAD SLAVES FLEE 
KNOWING THAT IF THEY ARE CAUGHT THEY COULD BE PUT TO DEATH 
MISTRESS MISTRESS 
DID YOU FIND HIM I COULD NOT GET OUT OF THE CITY MISTRESS IT IS CHOKED WITH PEOPLE 
ANIMALS CARTS ALL FLEEING TO THE SOUTH THERE ARE BODIES IN THE STREETS 
WHERE ARE THE OTHERS RESTITUTUS 
MISTRESS THE GODS HAVE DECIDED TO KILL US ALL 
BY MID AFTERNOON VESUVIUS HAS THROWN OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION TONNES OF PUMICE AND ASH ON POMPEII 
AS IT COLLECTS ITS THREAT GROWS 
MY GARDEN WILL BE RUINED WE'LL ALL BE RUINED UNLESS IT STOPS 
AFTER ALL THAT MONEY I'VE SPENT ON THE ELECTION IF ONLY WE'D REBUILT THE TEMPLE SOONER 
MOTHER 
JULIA 
SHE FELL FROM THE BED I'M ALL RIGHT REALLY 
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO THE HOUSE IS STRONG THE WALLS THICK WE STAY 
AND PRAY 
NEWS OF THE DISASTER IS CARRIED BY MESSENGER TO ADMIRAL PLINY 
REMARKABLE I THINK IT MUST BE A FIRE MOUNTAIN LIKE ETNA 
I MUST GET CLOSER IS THE BOAT READY YES MASTER GOOD 
GAIUS DO YOU WANT TO COME I'D RATHER FINISH THIS WORK 
YOU MAY NEVER GET ANOTHER CHANCE TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS CLOSE UP AS YOU WISH MASTER A MESSENGER 
PLINIUS SECUNDUS A LETTER FROM RECTINA WIFE OF TASCIUS SHE FEARS FOR HER LIFE SIR 
AND HER HOUSEHOLD THE EARTHQUAKE YES YES I CAN READ 
THIS LETTER IS A DESPERATE PLEA FOR HELP A FRIEND OF PLINY'S IS STRANDED AT THE FOOT OF VESUVIUS 
HER ONLY HOPE OF ESCAPE IS BY SEA THE COASTLINE IS THICK WITH VILLAS 
IT SEEMS THAT THE SCHOLAR MUST GIVE WAY TO THE ADMIRAL AND RESCUE 
ANYCATUS ORDER THE QUADRIREMES TO SET SAIL AS MANY AS CAN BE MANNED 
FOLLOW ME TO POMPEII 
VESUVIUS HAS BEEN ERUPTING FOR THREE HOURS 
PARTICLES OF ASH AND MAGMA COLLIDE TRIGGERING FEARSOME VOLCANIC LIGHTNING 
IT ILLUMINATES THE CITY'S DESPERATE PLIGHT 
PUMICE CONTINUES TO BOMBARD THE CITY 
MASTER 
WHAT I'M FRIGHTENED 
THE WEIGHT OF PUMICE ON BALCONIES AND ROOFS CREATES A NEW DANGER 
GODDESS HEAR MY PRAYER IN MY HOUR OF NEED 
GREAT GODDESS HEAR MY PRAYER 
HEDONE 
HEDONE 
HEDONE 
IT WILL BE ALMOST TWO THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE SLAVE'S BODY AND HER BRACELET ARE UNCOVERED 
IN THE RUINS OF THIS CHEAP HOTEL 
EVERY HOME IN POMPEII FACES THE SAME THREAT 
THE ROOFS ARE BUILT TO WITHSTAND NOTHING HEAVIER THAN RAIN 
IT'S NOT IF THEY WILL COLLAPSE BUT WHEN 
MERCIFUL GOD JUPITER ACCEPT OUR HUMBLE OFFERING 
HELP US GREAT JUPITER WE UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT YOUR ANGER WE BEG YOU MASTER 
MASTER THE ROOF IS THICK WITH STONES GROANING 
WE MUST MOVE WE SHALL FINISH FELIX THE BEAMS ARE SOLID 
SO WHERE IS THERE THAT IS SAFE 
FROM SURVIVING RECORDS WE KNOW THAT ADMIRAL PLINY'S RESCUE MISSION WAS UNDER WAY AROUND FIVE P. M. 
HE PASSED A TOWN EVEN CLOSER TO THE DANGER THAN POMPEII 
BUT KEPT CLEAR OF FALL OUT BY THE WIND 
IT'S CALLED HERCULANEUM 
BY LATE AFTERNOON MOST PEOPLE HAD FLED OR GATHERED ON THE BEACH HOPING FOR RESCUE 
AMONGST THEM A YOUNG GIRL 
WE DON'T KNOW HER NAME BUT FROM THE WEAR PATTERNS ON HER BONES WE KNOW SHE WAS A SLAVE 
BUT PLINY DIDN'T STOP 
HE TOOK HIS SHIPS TOWARDS POMPEII INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE FALL OUT ZONE 
HOLD YOUR COURSE 
ADMIRAL I CANNOT SEE 
WE WILL BE WRECKED VERY WELL WE STEER TO THE LIGHT THEN 
TO THE LIGHT WE GO TO STABIAE 
WITH THE WIND BEHIND HIM PLINY CAN'T TURN BACK 
INSTEAD HE HEADS FURTHER ALONG THE COAST TO THE SMALL TOWN OF STABIAE 
IT'S NOW PLINY'S ONLY CHANCE OF REFUGE 
THE ERUPTION COLUMN NOW TOWERS TWENTY FIVE KILOMETRES INTO THE SKY 
OVER TWICE THE HEIGHT OF EVEREST 
THE EFFECT ON YOUNG GAIUS IS PROFOUND 
IN TIME HIS RECOLLECTIONS WILL PROVE MORE IMPORTANT THAN HE COULD EVER HAVE IMAGINED 
SEVEN HOURS INTO THE ERUPTION POMPEII'S STREETS ARE ALMOST DESERTED 
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CASUALTIES 
PAPA 
PAPA 
AS THE PUMICE CONTINUES TO FALL IT BLOCKS DOORWAYS TRAPPING THOSE SHELTERING INSIDE 
MISTRESS 
IF WE STAY HERE WE'LL BE BURIED WE MUST RUN AWAY HOW 
RIGHT HERE 
HURRY MISTRESS JUMP 
MISTRESS I HAVE A FAMILY A FAMILY SO WHAT OF IT 
NO NO ABSOLUTELY NOT 
YOUR DUTY IS HERE WITH ME 
THE DEEPENING CRISIS FORCES EVERYONE TO RE EVALUATE THEIR POSITION 
WELL WHAT DO YOU SAY STAYING OR GOING BOTH ARE EQUALLY DANGEROUS 
WHICH IS WHY EVERYONE MUST CHOOSE I CANNOT GO FATHER 
THEN NOR CAN I OF COURSE I WILL STAY 
WE WILL STAY TOO MASTER YOU NEED NOT FELIX 
YOUR FATE IS OUR FATE MASTER NO LONGER YOU ARE ALL FREE 
FREED MEN AND WOMEN 
THANK YOU MASTER AND FREELY WE CHOOSE TO STAY 
AFTER EIGHT HOURS OF CONSTANT ERUPTION THE VIOLENCE OF VESUVIUS SHOWS NO SIGN OF FADING 
EVERY SECOND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TONNES OF MATERIAL BLASTS OUT 
BUT A FAR DEADLIER CHANGE IS NOW TAKING PLACE BENEATH THE EARTH 
AS THE CHAMBER OF MOLTEN MAGMA BEGINS TO EMPTY HOTTER AND HEAVIER ROCK FROM DEEP BELOW RISES UP 
IT MAKES THE COLUMN DENSER AND MORE LIKELY TO COLLAPSE UNLEASHING A TERRIBLE NEW THREAT 
THERE'S MORE IN MY CELL 
THE PUMICE AND ASH SUCK MOISTURE FROM THE AIR PARCHING THE THROAT AND MOUTH 
BARRACKS 
AAH 
THIS WAY 
I CAME HERE TO SEE THE THRACIAN AND YOU ARE FORTUNATA WIFE OF STEPHANUS THE FULLER 
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE MY WAY TO THE STABIAE GATE AND YOUR HUSBAND 
FORTUNATA 
RESTITUTUS 
ANYBODY 
TIME AND OPTIONS ARE QUICKLY RUNNING OUT AND NOT JUST IN POMPEII 
PLINY TRAPPED AT STABIAE BY AN ONSHORE WIND 
HAS FOUND SHELTER WITH A FRIEND POMPONIANUS 
I AM IMPRESSED THAT YOU CAN TAKE IT SO CALMLY UNTIL THE WIND SHIFTS 
OR DROPS WHAT CAN WE DO 
BESIDES WHEN YOU'VE TRAVELLED AS WIDELY AS I HAVE AND STUDIED 
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT THESE PHENOMENA ARE SIMPLY WORKINGS OF NATURE 
AND NOT TO BE FEARED 
WELL READ THOUGH HE WAS EVEN PLINY COULDN'T GRASP THE SCALE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
THE MOUNTAIN IS SPEWING FIRE 
THE WHOLE SUMMIT IS ALIGHT 
COURAGE MY DEAR FRIEND 
IN THE MORNING WHEN THE WIND PERMITS WE WILL LEAVE THIS PLACE 
UNTIL THEN 
STAND FIRM 
BUT POMPONIANUS IS RIGHT TO BE AFRAID 
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO THE MOUNTAIN SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO IT 
WHAT HAPPENED WAS SO BIZARRE THAT ALTHOUGH GAIUS LATER DESCRIBED IT 
NO ONE BELIEVED HIM 
NOW HEAVIER WITH DENSER ROCK PART OF THE COLUMN COLLAPSED 
IT CASCADED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN IN A GREAT WAVE 
SUPERHEATED ASH AND MOLTEN ROCK CHURNED DOWN THE VOLCANO IN A RACING BURNING AVALANCHE 
IT'S NOW KNOWN AS A PYROCLASTIC SURGE 
THIS BLISTERING WAVE HEADED STRAIGHT TOWARDS HERCULANEUM AND THE PEOPLE ON THE BEACH 
AMONG THEM THE YOUNG SLAVE GIRL AND THE THREE MONTH OLD BABY IN HER CARE 
FIVE TIMES HOTTER THAN BOILING WATER THIS CLOUD OF GAS AND ASH INCINERATES EVERYTHING 
AND EVERYONE IN ITS PATH 
THE SEARING HEAT IS SO INTENSE DEATH IS INSTANTANEOUS 
THE PEOPLE ON THE BEACH DO NOT JUST BURN THEY TURN TO CHARCOAL 
INSIDE THE BOATHOUSES DEATH WAS DIFFERENT 
PEOPLE DIED FROM THERMAL SHOCK 
AS THE BOILING SURGE CLOUDS SETTLED ON THEIR BODIES THEIR SOFT TISSUES VAPORISED 
TEETH AND BONE SHATTERED LIKE FRAGILE GLASS UNDER BOILING WATER 
THEIR BRAINS BOILED 
THEN EXPLODED 
THE SKELETONS OF THREE HUNDRED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE BOATHOUSES 
WHEN THE ERUPTION FINALLY STOPPED HERCULANEUM AND ITS VICTIMS LAY BURIED UNDER TWENTY FIVE METRES 
OF VOLCANIC DEBRIS 
POMPEII FACES A SIMILAR FATE 
BUT IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING IT'S STILL FALLING PUMICE 
THAT CAUSES THE MOST DISTRESS 
THE WELLS HAVE BECOME BLOCKED AND WATER IS IN DANGEROUSLY SHORT SUPPLY 
GO ON HE WON'T BE NEEDING MUCH MORE 
TO THINK I SHOULD FIND MYSELF HERE WITH GLADIATORS 
TO THINK WE SHOULD FIND OURSELVES HERE WITH THE WIFE OF A FULLER 
WHAT'S IN THE BOX NOTHING 
NOTHING OF ANY VALUE 
MASTER THE KITCHEN IS BURIED THEN THEY WILL HAVE TO DO 
REMEMBER FELIX MASTER NO LONGER 
LET US CLOSE THESE DOORS WHILE WE STILL CAN 
CLOSE NEXT DOOR TOO 
I HATE BEING SHUT IN 
IT WON'T BE FOREVER 
AS DAWN BREAKS ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF AUGUST 
VESUVIUS HAS BEEN ERUPTING FOR SEVENTEEN HOURS 
PLINY PLINY 
PLINY PLEASE WAKE UP PLINY 
WHAT WHAT'S THE MATTER SLEEP ANY MORE AND YOU WILL BE TRAPPED 
THE PEBBLES ARE BANKED UP OUTSIDE 
AND ON THE ROOFS WE'RE WONDERING IF THE HOUSE CAN STAND THEM OR IF WE SHOULD FLEE FLEE 
WHERE 
THE WORST IS YET TO COME 
EVERY HOUSEHOLD AROUND THE BAY OF NAPLES IS NOW IN DANGER 
MAMA WE MUST LEAVE 
NO THE HOUSE COULD FALL 
NO NOT UNTIL YOUR UNCLE IS SAFELY BACK IN PORT 
THIS MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE SIGNALS ANOTHER DEADLY CHANGE IN THE ERUPTION 
AT THE HEART OF THE VOLCANO THE MAGMA CHAMBER HAS COLLAPSED 
IT TRIGGERS ANOTHER PYROCLASTIC SURGE 
THIS TIME IT HEADS STRAIGHT FOR POMPEII 
MIRACULOUSLY THE SURGE CLOUD RUNS OUT OF ENERGY JUST SHORT OF THE NORTHERN WALL 
THE CITY IS SPARED 
BUT A CLOUD OF TOXIC GAS CARRIED BY THE SURGE QUICKLY SPREADS THROUGH THE STREETS AND HOUSES 
CARBON DIOXIDE SUFFOCATING AND DEADLY 
WHAT IN THE NAME OF THE GODS IS HAPPENING 
HYDROGEN CHLORIDE AN ACID THAT BURNS THE EYES AND THROAT 
THEY FORM A LETHAL COCKTAIL 
ARE WE GOING TO DIE MOTHER NO NO OF COURSE NOT 
WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING WE'RE TRAPPED 
THE SMELL IS EASING WE COULD REMOVE THEM FROM THE HINGES 
HOW WITH WHAT 
NO WATER NO AIR AND NOW NO LIGHT 
NO MORE OF THAT SABINUS WE MUST JUST PRAY FOR A SOLUTION 
COME SAVE YOUR STRENGTH 
JULIA WHAT 
WHAT IS IT DEATH 
WHERE DID YOU GET IT IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S PAINLESS AND QUICK 
IN EXTREMES SUICIDE WAS AN ACCEPTABLE FORM OF DEATH FOR THE ROMANS 
AFTER NEARLY EIGHTEEN HOURS VESUVIUS IS ALMOST SPENT 
THE PRESSURE FORCING THE ROCK AND GAS UPWARDS WEAKENS 
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE WHOLE COLUMN COLLAPSES 
EVEN WITH THIS HORROR HANGING OVER THEM PEOPLE STILL PROWL THE STREETS 
TWO THOUSAND YEARS LATER VICTIMS WILL BE FOUND STILL CLUTCHING SACKS OF GOLD AND PRECIOUS OBJECTS 
WERE THEY LOOTERS OR THIEVES 
OR JUST DESPERATE SOULS TRYING TO SAVE THEIR FORTUNE 
HELP ME 
WHO'S THERE 
HELP ME 
HELP ME 
GOLD BROUGHT HIM BACK 
BUT IT WOULD NOT SAVE HIM 
FROM THE SIDE OF THE COLUMN A BLISTERING WAVE OF ASH AND ROCK EXPLODES 
SCORCHING AND SMASHING EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH IT HURTLES DOWNWARDS 
NOTHING ELSE THAT COMES FROM A VOLCANO IS SO HOT OR MOVES WITH SUCH DEVASTATING POWER 
TRAVELLING AT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED K. M. AN HOUR IT WILL TAKE JUST A FEW MINUTES FOR THE PYROCLASTIC SURGE 
TO REACH POMPEII 
NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED 
VENUS GODDESS OF LOVE HELP ME NOW 
YOU BORE ME SHOW ME A SIGN 
MY HEART POUNDS BUT I FEEL NO FEAR 
PAPA 
CLAUDIA CLAUDIA 
CLAUDIA 
DEATH FOR THE PEOPLE OF POMPEII WAS NOT INSTANTANEOUS 
THE FIRST BREATH INHALES HOT GAS AND ASH CAUSING THE LUNGS TO FILL WITH FLUID 
IT'S LIKE SWALLOWING FIRE 
THE SECOND BREATH MIXES ASH WITH THE FLUID CREATING A WET CEMENT IN THE LUNGS AND WINDPIPE 
THE THIRD BREATH THICKENS THE CEMENT CAUSING THE VICTIMS TO GASP FOR BREATH THEN SUFFOCATE 
WOULD THEY HAVE KNOWN THEY WERE DYING 
FROM THEIR DEATH THROES IT SEEMS ALMOST CERTAIN 
BUT VESUVIUS HAS ONE FINAL HORROR TO UNLEASH 
FASCINATING THE MOUNTAIN 
FASCINATING 
PLINY 
AFTER EIGHTEEN HOURS OF ERUPTION THE BOTTOM SECTION OF THE COLUMN COLLAPSES SPECTACULARLY 
COURAGEOUS STUBBORN OR FOOLHARDY PLINY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO SAVE HIS LIFE 
PLINY 
THOSE WHO SURVIVED REPORTED THAT HE FELL WHERE HE STOOD OVERWHELMED BY GASES CARRIED BY THE CLOUD 
THE FINAL AND GREATEST SURGE TRAVELS RIGHT ACROSS THE BAY OF NAPLES IN A BLACK CLOUD OF DEATH 
MOTHER WE MUST LEAVE NOW 
SAVE YOURSELF GAIUS 
RUN I WON'T LEAVE YOU MOTHER TAKE MY HAND 
IT'S IN THE HANDS OF THE GODS MY UNCLE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE GODS COVER YOUR MOUTH 
THE FINAL SURGE KILLS THOUSANDS WHO HAVE FLED INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE 
BUT NOT THE MAN WHOSE WRITINGS WOULD PROVE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT HAPPENED 
PLINY THE YOUNGER 
THOUGH MY MIND SHRINKS FROM REMEMBERING I WILL BEGIN 
DARKNESS FELL 
NOT THE DARK OF A MOONLESS OR CLOUDY NIGHT BUT AS IF THE LAMP HAD BEEN PUT OUT IN A CLOSED ROOM 
WE COULD HEAR THE SHRIEKS OF WOMEN THE WAILING OF INFANTS THE SHOUTS OF MEN 
SOME WERE CALLING THEIR PARENTS OTHERS THEIR CHILDREN OR WIVES 
TRYING TO RECOGNISE THEM BY THEIR VOICES' CLAUDIA 
PEOPLE BEWAILED THEIR OWN FATE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO PRAYED FOR DEATH IN THEIR TERROR OF DYING 
BUT IT'S PLINY'S DESCRIPTION OF THE ERUPTION THAT PROVIDES THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE DISASTER 
A FEARFUL BLACK CLOUD WAS RENT BY FORKED AND QUIVERING BURSTS OF FLAME 
AND PARTED TO REVEAL GREAT TONGUES OF FIRE 
IT SANK TO EARTH AND COVERED THE SEA BLOTTING MISENUM FROM SIGHT 
I LOOKED AROUND A DENSE BLACK CLOUD WAS COMING UP BEHIND US 
SPREADING OVER THE EARTH LIKE A FLOOD 
I DERIVED SOME POOR CONSOLATION THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WAS DYING 
AND ME WITH IT 
PLINY'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SURGE CLOUDS THAT SWEPT FROM VESUVIUS WAS SO BIZARRE IT WAS NOT BELIEVED 
ONLY IN RECENT YEARS HAS SCIENCE VINDICATED HIM 
WE NOW KNOW THAT THESE EXPLOSIVE VOLCANIC EVENTS CAN HAPPEN JUST AS HE DESCRIBED 
THEY'RE KNOWN AS PLINIAN ERUPTIONS 
IN JUST EIGHTEEN HOURS VESUVIUS SPEWED OUT MORE THAN TEN BILLION TONNES OF PUMICE ROCK AND ASH 
A RESCUE ATTEMPT WAS LAUNCHED FROM ROME BUT THE DEVASTATION WAS SIMPLY TOO GREAT 
FOR MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS THE CITY LAY BURIED AND FORGOTTEN 
THEN IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR IT WAS REDISCOVERED BY CHANCE WHEN AN AQUEDUCT WAS BEING BUILT 
EXCAVATIONS HAVE NOW BEEN GOING ON FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
WHAT THEY UNCOVERED HAS AMAZED THE WORLD 
THE ASH HAD FORMED A SEAL AROUND THE CITY LIKE A TIME CAPSULE PRESERVING TEMPLES SHOPS 
STREETS AND HOUSES 
BUT MOST POIGNANT OF ALL ARE THE CASTS 
VICTIMS WHOSE BODIES DECAYED LEAVING ONLY THEIR SHAPES PRESERVED IN THE ASH THAT SMOTHERED THEM 
MEN WOMEN CHILDREN 
EVEN ANIMALS 
THEIR FINAL MOMENTS IMMORTALISED 
SOME VICTIMS EVEN LEFT CLUES TO THEIR IDENTITY 
WELL THIS IS THE ROOM I WANT IT COMPLETELY RE DONE 
DON'T FRET SABINUS THE FIRST CHILD IS ALWAYS THE HARDEST ON THE MOTHER YOU'LL HAVE MANY MORE 
THE GODS WILLING EH 
IN THE HOUSE OF POLYBIUS THE SKELETON OF A HEAVILY PREGNANT WOMAN WAS FOUND 
SURROUNDED BY HER FAMILY 
ARE WE GOING TO DIE MOTHER NO OF COURSE NOT WE'RE TRAPPED 
IN THE GLADIATORS' BARRACKS THE REMAINS OF A RICH BEJEWELLED LADY ALONGSIDE THOSE OF GLADIATORS 
TO THINK I SHOULD FIND MYSELF HERE WITH GLADIATORS THAT WE SHOULD BE HERE WITH THE WIFE OF A FULLER 
IN THE RUINS OF A CHEAP HOTEL A SLAVE GIRL STILL WEARING HER INSCRIBED BRACELET 
YOUR BRACELET HEDONE WHAT DOES IT SAY 
FROM THE MASTER TO HIS SLAVE GIRL 
CLOSE TO THE FULLERY OF STEPHANUS A SKELETON STILL CLUTCHING A BAG OF GOLD 
FORTUNATA RESTITUTUS 
ANYBODY 
MOUNT VESUVIUS STILL DOMINATES THE BAY OF NAPLES 
ITS FERTILE SOILS LURE PEOPLE TO ITS SLOPES JUST AS THEY DID TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
ONLY NOW THIRTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE LIVE UNDER ITS SHADOW 
VESUVIUS HAS NEVER AGAIN ERUPTED WITH THE SAME APOCALYPTIC FORCE AS THAT HOT SUMMER'S DAY IN AD SEVENTY NINE 
ACCORDING TO THE EXPERTS PLINIAN ERUPTIONS OF THIS SCALE ONLY HAPPEN EVERY TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
THE NEXT ONE IS DUE 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET 
YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
