RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HAD A PROBLEM IN 
DELIVERING ON HIS IMMENSE TALENT 
HE HAS ADMITTED AND HIS BOOK THAT 
INTO ONE THOUSAND ONE HE ALMOST DIDN'T GET TO 
THE STARTING LINE AND WOULD NOT 
HAVE DONE HAD HE NOT BEEN 
PRESCRIBED PROZAC 
OVER THE YEARS 
O'SULLIVAN AND HENDRY HAVE HAD 
BETTER RIVALRY 
HAS GONE 
OVER THE TOP ON A FEW OCCASIONS 
BUT IT IS LIKE ANY FOOTBALLER OR 
BALSA WOOD DO BEFORE THEY GO OUT 
TO BATTLE BOXER WOULD DO 
WELL THAT MIGHT BE PAR FOR THE 
COURSE IN BOXING IT CERTAINLY IS 
NOT IN SNOOKER 
WHEN YOU KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO 
WATCH 
A GREAT PLAYER 
YOU WERE 
NOT 
WATCH A GREAT PLAYER YOU WERE NOT SURE IF HE WAS GOING TO WORK OUT OR 
NOT MOST 
OF US ISSUES WERE WERE 
NOT MOST OF US ISSUES WERE WERE THEMSELVES 
RONNIE WAS SULLIVAN WAS LITERALLY 
PULLING WHAT HERE HE HAD LEFT AND 
HIS HAIR OUT YOU COULD SEE THAT HE 
WAS STRUGGLING 
PETER WAS DOING HIS 
BEST TO PUT RONNIE OFF MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN WASTING A LITTLE BIT OF TIME 
HE WAS DOING WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO 
HIM PETER EBDON WAS NOT 
TO BEAT HIM SPEAKING CHEATING HE WAS PLAYING 
OUT HIS OWN SPEED BUT WENT RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN GETS IT RIGHT HE IS 
UNDOUBTEDLY THE GREATEST PLAYER TO 
WATCH 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY THAT HERE WATCH RONNIE'S HE DID HAVE JUST GOING 
BUT AS ANOTHER RECORD THAT RONNIE 
WILL HOLD THAT WILL NEVER BE BEATEN 
HE WAS BEATEN BY GRAEME DOTT AND 
THEN HE GAVE HIS CUE AWAY TO A 
YOUNG LAD AND THE FRONT ROW 
THINK HE MAKES THE GAME VERY 
INTERESTING 
THE BOOKS SHOW THAT INTERESTING GRAEME DOTT BEAT HIM BUT IN EFFECT 
RONNIE WAS SULLIVAN BEAT HIMSELF 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
IT DOES NOT SUIT 
HIM THE CRUCIBLE OVER SEVENTEEN DAYS 
THAT IT WAS A TOURNAMENT IN A WEEK 
HE WOULD WIN IT EVERY OTHER TIME IT 
WAS PLAYED 
IT DOES NOT SUIT THEM 
BEING AWAY FROM HOME FOR TWO AND A 
HALF WEEKS 
HE HAS WON TWO WORLD 
TITLES TWENTY RANKING EVENTS SHOULD 
LOADS OF PRIZE MONEY AND HAS MADE 
EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BREAKS AND YET HE IS AN 
UNDER ACHIEVER HANN HE KNOWS IT 
IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT RONNIE WAS 
WILL THEN HAVE MARK WILLIAMS HAVE 
VERY SO ALTHOUGH PLAYED EACH OTHER 
THEY HAVE ONLY MET AT THE CRUCIBLE 
ONCE HOW HAVE THEY MANAGED TO 
AVOID EACH OTHER 
THEY MUST HAVE 
FOUND EACH OTHER IN DIFFERENT 
HALVES OF THE DRAW BUT IT IS 
SOMETHING TO GET PAST LOOK FORWARD 
TO 
HOW DO YOU PREPARE MARK TO WILLIAMS TO FACE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
HE HAS PLAYED HIM A FEW TIMES OVER 
THE YEARS BUT YOU DO NOT NEED ANY 
INSPIRATION TO GO OUT AND PLAY 
AGAINST THE ROCKET IF THE 
ATMOSPHERE DOES NOT GET YOU GOING 
NOTHING DOES 
IT IS ALMOST PIN DROP 
TIME AT THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE AS 
ONE MATCH STARTS ANOTHER WILL 
FINISH AS SURE MURPHY AND ALI 
CARTER WILL BE PLAYING TO THE 
FINISH OVER TO IT OUR OUR M. C. MR.

WITH THE CUE IN HIS VAN DUNNO 
DOUBLE WORLD CHAMPION HERE COMES 
THE ROCKET RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
BOTH OF THESE MATCHES AVAILABLE ON 
INTERACTIVE TONIGHT BEST OF TWENTY FIVE 
FRAMES IN THE SECOND ROUND PLAYING 
FOR A PLACE IN THE QUARTER FINAL 
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT OF THESE TWO 
PIPINGS OF THE GAME LET'S ASK 
COMMENTATORS JOHN VIRGO AND DENNIS 
TAYLOR 
YOU HEARD THE CRUCIBLE AUDIENCE 
THE ATMOSPHERE IS ELECTRIC THIS 
EVENING CUSTOMARY BREAK OFF WITH 
THE LEFT HAND 
HE CAN ONLY SEE ONE RED MARK 
WILLIAMS AND HE MIGHT JUST HAVE 
GO AT IT THE BLACK AND PINK ARE 
TIED UP HE WILL PLAY THE SAFETY 
SHOT LOOKING AT THAT ANGLE HE 
COULD NOT GET BACK FOR THE BLUE SO 
NO VALUE IN TRYING FOR THE POT 
THIS IS FASCINATING ONE JOIN 
YES IT IS JOHN ARE SIGNS 
THAT MARK WILLIAMS IS GETTING BACK 
TO THE FORM THAT SAW HIM WINNING 
HERE TWICE AND RONNIE HAS ONLY THE 
U. K. TO SHOW FOR HIS FORM BUT THAT 
IS USUALLY A GOOD FORM GUIDE FOR 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
THEY HAVE LOT PLAYED EACH OTHER FOR 
SIX YEARS BUT THEY HAVE PLAYED EACH 
OTHER TWENTY ONE TIMES SO THEY ALL THOSE 
SECRETS FROM EACH OTHER HOLD NO 
SECRETS 
A LITTLE BIT UNLUCKY HE JUST 
PLAYED TO KNOCK THE RED UP THE 
TABLE BUT WHEN YOU ARE COMING OFF 
THE CUSHION YOU'RE NEVER SURE WHAT 
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE OBJECT 
BALL THE PINK MAY BE AVAILABLE 
INTO THE RIGHT MIDDLE OR POSSIBLY 
THE LEFT CORNER HE HASN'T GOT THE 
ANGLE TO DROP ON IT 
HE PLAYED THAT PERFECTLY HE IS GOING TO TRY AND DEVELOP THE 
BLACK CANNON IT THAT RED NEXT TO 
IT 
HE CAUGHT THE RED A FRACTION IT TOO FULL OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE 
PUT MORE DISTANCE BETWEEN CUE BALL 
AND OBJECT BALL HE'S MISSED IT IT 
IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'RE 
CLOSE TO THE BALL HE JUST OVER CUT 
IT 
YOU CAN HEAR A PIN DROP AT THE 
MOMENT IT HAS AN ATMOSPHERE ALL OF 
ITS OWN 
THE NOISE FROM THE OTHER 
TABLE ADDS TO THE AT THIS HERE 
THE ATMOSPHERE HE IS ON THE PINK 
IF HE HASN'T GOT AN ANGLE WHEN 
POTTING THIS PINK THERE'S NOTHING 
AVAILABLE 
IT JUST DEPENDS WHETHER HE CAN 
PINCH A LITTLE BIT 
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT IS THE END OF 
BREAK 
THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN GREEN AND 
BLUE TO GLANCE OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF 
THE REDS HE HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL 
HE DOESN'T GO IN OFF INTO THE 
CORNER 
CONTRACT A LITTLE BIT ON THE THICK 
SIDE HE IS GOING TO LEAVE A 
LONGISH POT FOR MARK WILLIAMS IF 
MARK BROOMES STARTS TO KNOCK THIS 
TYPE OF SHOT HIM HE IS GOING TO BE 
A VERY DANGEROUS SHOT IN 
I'M NOT SURE RATHER BLACK WILL GO 
ONCE ITS POTTED THERE IS BLACK 
A RED ROUNDABOUT THE BLACK SPOT 
AREA IT MIGHT GO ON TO THE PINK 
SPOT 
HE IS NOT RUSHING ROUND THE SPOT TABLE MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING HE 
HAS BEEN TALKING TO TERRY GRIFFITHS 
ABOUT TAKING HIS TIME AND NOT 
RUSHING THINGS 
IN THE FIRST FRAME 
YOU DO NOT WANT TO MAKE ANY SILLY 
MISTAKES THERE WILL BE NERVES IT 
LOOKS AS IF IT WILL HAVE TO GO ON 
THE PINK SPOT HIGHEST AVAILABLE 
NOT THE BEST POSITIONAL SHOT THERE 
FROM MARK HE 
EVEN POT IT 
FROM MARK THERE IT IS TWO CHANCES AND HE HAS 
ONLY SCORED TWENTY ONE POINTS CAN RONNIE 
POOLE OUT A BETTER SHORT THIS TIME 
ONCE AGAIN THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN 
GREEN AND BLUE FOR HIM TO HIT THE 
RED JUST TO THE SIDE OF THE BLACK 
HE HIT IT TOO THICK ON HIS LAST 
ATTEMPT THAT IS BETTER 
THIS IS RONNIE'S FIRST CHANCE HE 
CAN TAKE THIS RED ON AND FINISH ON 
A CHOICE OF PINK OR BLACK IF HE 
COMES OFF THE CUSHION THERE IS A 
CHOICE OF PINK OR BLACK HE HAS 
RYAN BACK UP THE TABLE AGAIN HAS 
HE GOT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BLUE 
BABY HASN'T GOT THE ANGLE TO GET 
OUT INTO THE TABLE MAYBE 
HE IS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BLUE 
JUST LOOKING NOW WHERE HE NEEDS TO 
LEAVE THE CUE BALL HE CAN PLAY FOR 
BLACK OR PINK THE BLACK IS 
MISSABLE IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT 
THAN THE BLUE SUPPOSE THE BLACK 
WILL GO ON THE PINK SPOT AND THAT 
WILL TIE IT UP BLUE IS BETTER CHOICE 
HE CAN PLAY FOR THE PINK IT WILL 
GO ON ITS SPOT AND BE TIED UP BUT 
THE BLACK WILL STILL BE OUT IN THE 
OPEN 
COULD HAVE DONE WITH COMING A 
LITTLE BIT STRAIGHTER ON THIS PINK HE PLAYED THAT WELL 
THAT MARCO TOLD THE REFEREE THAT 
THERE WAS JUST ENOUGH ROOM MUST 
HAVE TOUCHED THE RED MARKER 
MUSN'T TOUCH THE RED LET'S SEE HOW 
MANY RONNIE CAN MAKE MARK HAVING 
MISSED TWO GOOD CHANCES 
DOESN'T HAVE TO CANNON INTO 
ANYTHING ONE OF THE REDS TO THE 
LEFT OF THE PINK IS AVAILABLE INTO 
THE CORNER AND 
HE HAS 
GOT THE 
TWO 
OUT AND THE OPEN 
HE IS THIRTY POINTS IN FRONT SO HE WILL 
NOT NEED THE DIFFICULT RED THAT IS 
ALMOST TOUCHING THE PINK 
I'M NOT SURE QUITE WHAT HAPPENED 
THERE BUT THIS RED MUST BE VERY 
TIGHT IT WILL PASS AND IT'S THERE 
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY THE CANNON 
THERE BUT I THINK HE THOUGHT 
WOULD STILL BE ON A NICE EASY RED 
THIS IT'S MORE DIFFICULT BUT HE IS 
CUEING WELL 
HE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE 
MISSED THAT FORTY SEVEN POINTS IN THE LEAD 
EQUATES TO ONE SNOOKER FOR MARK 
WILLIAMS TO TIE 
IF RONNIE WAS TO 
PLAY THE SHOT OVER AGAIN HE WOULD 
NOT HAVE TRIED TO DEVELOP THAT RED 
BUT HE DID HAMPER HIMSELF 
THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD SHOT HE IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO COME OFF THE TOP 
CUSHION WITH LOTS OF SIDE 
PLAYING IT OFF TWO CUSHIONS HE HAS 
GOT TO HIT THIS ONE AND HE HAS 
MISSED IT 
FERGAL MARK WILLIAMS 
FOUR FOUL 
IT IS ONLY THE OPENING FRAME 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN SHOULD ALREADY 
HAVE BEEN STARTING THE SECOND FRAME 
HE CAN ONLY TRY AT THE MOMENT BUT 
IF HE 
POTS THE 
BROWN THEN HE CAN 
IF HE POTS THE BROWN THEN HE CAN WIN 
YES HE DIDN'T BOTHER PLAYING WIN FOR A COLOUR ALTHOUGH THE BROWN IS 
ON IF HE DIDN'T HAVE THE ANGLE FOR 
THE BROWN HE 
COULD PLAY 
A SNOOKER 
BEHIND THE YELLOW HE IS PLAYING 
THE POT ON THE BROWN DID HE GET A 
HEAVY CONTACT HE WANTED TO BE 
CLOSER TO THIS RED HE CAN STILL 
POT IT NOW JUST THIRTY THREE POINTS BEHIND 
WITH THIRTY FIVE REMAINING SO APART FROM THE 
YELLOW ANY COLOUR OFF THIS RED 
WOULD DO 
THIS WILL HURT IF MARK ROOMS CAN 
KNOCK IN THIS LONG RED THERE WAS A 
BIT OF PRESSURE ON THAT HAS HE GOT 
AWAY WITH IT IT IS NOT AN EASY POT 
UP INTO THE CORNER HE COULD TAKE 
IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SAFETY IN 
MIND 
THIS IS A SNOOKER AND LIKE ALL 
SNOOKERS IT IS NOT JUST HITTING 
THEM BUT CAN YOU GET IT SAFE I I THINK HE CAN COME OFF THE SIDE 
CUSHION BUT WHERE IS THE RED GOING 
TO GO HE HAS MISSED IT AGAIN IT 
IS ANOTHER FREE BALL AS WELL THIS 
FRAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN OVER FIVE 
MINUTES AGO 
HE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED TO LOSE 
THIS FRAME OF THAT SHOULD HAPPEN 
AND IT COULD DO THE KEY SHOT 
COMING UP HE HAS GOT AN ANGLE ON 
THIS RED BUT IT IS A TRICKY ONE 
THE MORE PACE YOU PUT ON THE SHORT 
THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO MISS IT 
IT WOBBLED BUT IN IT WENT NEW 
FAVOURITE NOW 
NEEDS ALL THE COLOURS TO PINCH THIS 
OPENING FRAME 
A FRAME THAT MARK THOUGHT HE HAD 
LOST THEN RONNIE HAMPERED HIMSELF 
TRYING TO MOVE 
THE RED 
THAT HE 
DIDN'T NEED TO MOVE HAS HE GONE 
TOO FAR HE IS STRAIGHT ON IT SO 
HE 
IS GOING 
TO HAVE 
AN EDGY PINK TO 
TAKE ON HE'S RUNNING IT THROUGH 
AND HE HAS GOT A KICK OUT NOW IT IS 
GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO HOLD FOR 
THE 
BLACK AS 
A LEFT HANDER 
YOU 
WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT HE 
WOULD HAVE 
SCREWED BACK THERE 
I AGREE WITH 
YOU THAT WAS THE LEFT HANDER'S 
SIDE THE KEY SHOT WHEN YOU ARE 
CLEANING IS BROWN 
TO BLUE 
AND HE 
DID NOT GET ON THE BLUE BRIGHT 
THIS IS SUCH A DELICATE SCREW SHOT 
IF HE'S GOING TO HOLD FOR 
THE BLACK 
HE HAS 
GOT TO 
BE 
CAREFUL NOT 
TO GET 
THE WHITE INTO 
THE LEFT CORNER POCKET 
AND WELL HE HIT THAT TOO WELL 
WHAT AN EXCITING OPENING FRAME 
IT IS A THIN CUT INTO THE CORNER 
THE WHITE WILL BE GOING TOWARDS THE 
RIGHT MIDDLE POCKET 
IS IT THERE NO BUT THIS IS FAR 
FROM EASY HE CAN CUT THIS IN BUT 
HE WILL HAVE TO WATCH THE WHITE IT 
COULD GO IN THE CORNER JOHN IT IT WILL BE A DANGEROUS CUT TO 
TAKE ON 
I THINK HE CAN CUT IT BACK BUT 
WATCH OUT 
FOR THAT 
FAR RIGHT CORNER 
POCKET BEING 
SO CLOSE TO THE 
CUSHION I CANNOT CHANGE THE 
DIRECTION OF THE 
CUE BALL 
IF HE 
PLAYS THE POT IT IS RISKY HE 
CANNOT WHAT AN OPENING FRAME 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN LOOKED VERY 
COMFORTABLE BUT MARK WILLIAMS 
ALMOST CLEARED TO PINCH THE FRAME 
BUT RONNIE HAS ANIMAL TAKES IT AND 
LEADS ONE TO ZERO BUT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
TAKES IT 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE 
ATMOSPHERE IN THE CRUCIBLE TONIGHT 
ABSOLUTE ELECTRIC OUT THERE KENYA 
LIKEN IT TO ANYTHING YOU 
EXPERIENCED 
I PLAYED RONNIE BUT I EXPERIENCED HAVE NOT PLAYED ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
CAN YOU LIKEN IT IT IS A BIT 
MORE BOISTEROUS 
THE CROWD ARE 
CERTAINLY ENJOYING THIS MATCH SO 
FAR YOU TALK ABOUT ALEX HIGGINS 
ALSO JIMMY WHITE WHO CREATED THAT 
KIND OF ATMOSPHERE HAS THE OTHER 
BLOKE CANNOT BE AN OVERPOWERING 
SITUATION WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING 
AGAINST THE CROWD 
IT INSPIRES YOU 
I THINK MOST PLAYERS WILL GET 
INSPIRED BY PLAYING SOMEONE LIKE 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IT IS VERY WARM 
OUT THERE YOU CAN FEEL THE CROWD 
THE ATMOSPHERE IS ABSOLUTELY 
TREMENDOUS 
IT WAS BUZZING OUT TREMENDOUS THERE TONIGHT IN TERM OF MARK'S 
DEMEANOUR WHAT CAN YOU GAUGED FROM 
WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN QUESTION MARK 
NOT A LOT 
NEITHER OF THEM PLAYED 
REALLY WELL WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN 
NOT A LOT WE LIKE TO GIVE THEM A 
GOOD START 
THEY LONG LONG WAY TO 
GO A LONG 
SOME PEOPLE IN THE CROWD HAD T. 
SHIRTS SAYING I LOVE SNOOKER AND 
WHY WOULDN'T THEY AFTER AN OPENING 
FRAME LIKE THAT 
HE PUT EVERYTHING INTO THIS SHOT 
IT WAS ON THE BLACK HE HAS STUCK ONE 
UP FOR MARK HE COULD DO WITH 
KNOCKING FEW IN JUST TO MAKE 
HIMSELF FORGET ABOUT THAT OPENING 
FRAME THAT WAS A FRAME THAT HE 
ALMOST AND SHOULD HAVE PINCHED 
WELL HE HAS BEEN ASTRAY WITH HIS 
POSITION GOOD FEW TIMES NOW HE 
MAY HAVE RUN RIGHT OUT OF POSITION 
THERE THAT IS NOT GOING TO HELP 
MARK'S CONFIDENCE 
CAN HE PASS THE BROWN HE WAS A BIT 
UNLUCKY FOR IT TO CATCH THE MIDDLE 
JAW 
HE CANNOT GET TO THE POTTING ANGLE 
AS YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE 
THERE IS A SHOT HE COULD PLAY HERE 
HE COULD SEND THE RED BACK UP AND 
DOWN THE TABLE A FEW TIMES AND 
SCREW THE BALL BACK INTO THE BAULK 
AREA HE DID NOT WANT THE RED TO 
COME BACK 
UP HAS HE FLUKED ONE 
INTO THE MIDDLE POCKET ANOTHER 
CHANCE FOR MARK WILLIAMS 
HE DID 
NOT PLAY THE BEST OF SHOTS THERE 
RONNIE L. COULD SEE WHAT WAS IN HIS 
MIND BUT HE GOT NOWHERE NEAR WHERE 
HE WAS INTENDING TO PLAY IT 
WELL YOU COULD NOT REALLY CALL 
THAT UNLUCKY THE WHITE SHOULD NOT 
HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE NEAR THE MIDDLE 
POCKET STRIKING THE WAY HE DOES 
LIKE THAT UNDER ARM IT IS A MOST 
UNUSUAL WAY TO HOLD A CUE MARK IS 
THE ONLY ONE I HAVE EVER KNOWN TO 
DO THAT 
HE WILL HAVE TO SHARPEN UP HIS GAME 
HERE MARK AND HE KNOWS THAT WELL A TERRIFIC OPENING RED 
SO MUCH PRESSURE ON MARK WILLIAMS 
HERE HE HAS TO GET TO THE SEMI 
FINALS TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF 
STAYING IN THE TOP SIXTEEN 
THAT TOOK A BIT OF A QUICK BOUNCE 
I THINK HE IS STILL O. K. THOUGH 
THERE WAS CHOICE OF REDS THERE 
THE FIRST RED HE PASSED WHEN HE 
CAME OFF THE RED RIGHT CUSHION I 
THINK THERE WAS A CANNON ON THAT 
HE GOT INTO IT A LITTLE BIT TOO 
MUCH HE HAS PLAYED FOR THE PINK 
SO YOU ASSUMES IT YOU ASSUME IT 
GOES A LITTLE BIT TRICKY NOW NOT 
SO MUCH THE POT MORE THE 
POSITIONAL SIDE 
NOT INCH PERFECT ON THIS RED ABOVE 
THE BLACK HE HAS TO JUDGE THE 
CANNON ON THE SECOND RED WELL HERE 
A LITTLE BIT CLOSE TO THE BLUE 
THERE THINK HE CAN STILL SNEAK 
IT IN HE WILL HAVE TO AVOID THE 
BROWN AND THE GREEN HERE TO GET 
BACK TO THE REDS 
JUST A BIT OF A STRETCH THERE FOR 
HIM 
THERE IS SHANE FROM WEST LIFE HE 
IS A REAL SNOOKER FAN MOST OF THE 
BOYS IN THE BAND ARE HE IS A GOOD 
FRIEND OF KEN DOHERTY'S HE IS OFF 
TO AUSTRALIA ON MONDAY WITH THE 
FAMILY HE IS ON TOUR OUT THERE 
MARK JUST HOLDS HIS HAND UP TO HIS 
HEART ANY MORE PACE AND THAT WOULD 
NOT HAVE GONE IN 
I JUST HOPE THAT BOTH PLAY WELL 
JOHN SOME OF THE MATCHES THEY HAVE 
HAD IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN QUITE 
OUTSTANDING 
YES EVEN THOUGH THESE MATCHES ARE 
THREE SESSIONS TO EIGHTS AND EIGHTY NINE A 
MAXIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE FRAMES TWO EIGHTS AND 
A NINE L. THINK THIS FIRST FRAME WILL 
DETERMINE THE CLOSENESS OF THE 
MATCH 
AS WE ALWAYS SAY YOU DON'T REALLY 
SETTLE UNTIL YOU GET YOUR FIRST 
FRAME ON THE SCOREBOARD MARK 
SHOULD ACHIEVE THAT HERE 
THAT WAS CARELESS WHAT WILL RONNIE 
DO SIXTY SEVEN POINTS BEHIND A POSSIBLE FIFTY NINE 
LEFT ON THE TABLE IT SHOULD BE 
ENOUGH BUT YOU NEVER KNOW IT WAS 
NOT IN THE LAST FRAME 
THAT WAS 
JUST A LAPSE IN CONCENTRATION FROM 
MARK BUT IF RONNIE CAN GET THREE 
REDS THREE BLACKS AND LEAVE THAT 
RED NEAR THE CUSHION HE WILL HAVE 
A CHANCE OF GETTING A SNOOKER AND 
THEN ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF A 
FREE BALL THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED IN 
THE OPENING FRAME MARK WILLIAMS 
HAD RONNIE IN A COUPLE OF SNOOKERS 
HE MISSED AND LEFT A FREE BALL 
THAT IS ABOUT PERFECT HE WILL BE 
ABLE TO SNOOKER MARK IN BEHIND THE 
BLACK THIS NEW PUT HER HIM IN 
BEHIND THE BLACK SNOOKER HIM IN 
BEHIND THE BLACK 
JUST HAVING A 
LOOK THERE L. L. SUPPOSE THE IDEAL 
SPOT FOR THE RED IS SOME WAY IN AND 
AROUND THE BROWN HE POSSIBILITY 
THEN OF A FREE BALL 
POSSIBILITY THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING MAKE THIS SNOOKER HARD TO 
HIT 
HE HAS NOT PLAYED IT VERY WELL HIT HE HAS GOT 
THE SNOOKER 
IN BEHIND THE PINK BUT HE WANTED TO BE TIED IN BEHIND THE BLACK TIGHT IN L. 
AM NOT SURE WHETHER MARK CAN SWERVE 
IN BEHIND THE PINK HE WOULD PREFER 
THAT THAN COMING OFF THE CUSHION 
WITH THE RED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
TABLE 
NO HE IS COMING OFF THE BOTTOM 
CUSHION WITH LOTS OF SIDE RIGHT 
HAND SIDE AS HE LOOKS AT IT WATCH 
THE WHITE TOO MUCH 
NORMALLY WE WOULD CALL A MISS BUT 
WE ARE AT THE SNOOKERS REQUIRED 
STAGE THE REFEREE DID NOT CALL IT 
BUT APPARENTLY THEY CAN CORNET IF 
IT IS SNOOKERS REQUIRED FOR STIR UP 
I HAVE YET TO HEAR ONE BUT THERE 
WE GO 
EFFICIENT IT IS SNOOKERS 
REQUIRED IF IT IS SNOOKERS 
REQUIRED THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
IN THESE SITUATIONS IS TO GET THE 
OBJECT BALL SAFE IF HE DOES NOT 
GET THE RED SAFE HE WILL NOT HAVE 
ANY MORE CHANCES FOR SNOOKERS THIS 
IS A GOOD SHOT WHAT A SHOT THIS 
IS A FRACTION MORE AND IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO ESCAPE 
FROM L. THINK HE CAN SWERVE IT A LITTLE TAP ON THE TABLE FROM MARK 
WHERE IS THE CUE BALL IT MIGHT GET 
PULLED INTO THE POCKET BECAUSE OF 
THE SIDE HE HAD ON IT IT ALMOST 
PULLED IN OFF THE JAW 
HE HAS NOT GOT THE REDS SAFE THIS 
TIME THOUGH RED WILL HAVE TO COME 
TO THE ISSUE SAFE STEVE DOES THE 
RED WILL HAVE THE VET WILL HAVE 
TO COME TO THE RESCUE THAT IS WHAT 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE RED 
HE COULD PUT THE RIGHT IN THE 
WHITE IN OFF THE RED 
THE MOST OBVIOUS WAY TO TRY AND GET 
A SNOOKER HERE IS TO TRY AND GET 
THE CUE BALL IN BEHIND THE BLACK 
THAT IS NOT A BAD SNOOKER YOU MAY 
HAVE PUT AT THE NATURAL ONE CUSHION 
ESCAPE HE MAY HAVE PUT OUT 
I AM 
JUST WONDERING IF HE CAN GET OFF 
THE TWO CUSHIONS CAN HE PASSED THE 
BLACK TO GET ENOUGH ON IT TO COME 
OFF TWO CUSHIONS 
PAST THE BLACK CAN HE GET PAST THE BLACK HE MAY 
HAVE TO SWERVE QUITE A BIT TO GET 
TO THAT ANGLE 
WELL I AM LOOKING 
AT IT DENNIS I THINK IF HE CAN 
GET TO YOUR LINE HE WOULD HAVE 
PLAYED 
IT THAT 
IS THE 
MOST OBVIOUS 
WAY TO 
GET OUT OF THE SNOOKER IF 
IF HE GOES ONE CUSHION IT IS SO EASY 
TO HIT THE YELLOW IF HE GOES THE 
RIGHT SIDE OF THE TABLE OFF ONE 
CUSHION THERE IS LONG WAY TO 
TRAVEL AND HE COULD GO ROUND THE 
BACK OF THE RED QUITE EASILY YES YES AND IF HE PLAYS IT WITH ANY PACE 
THERE IS A DANGER OF COURSE THAT 
HE COULD LOSE THE FREE BALL AT THE 
MOMENT FOURTEEN SNOOKER WOULD THAI 
AT THE MOMENT A FOR POINT SNOOKER 
WOULD DRAW A FOUR POINT SNOOKER 
CAN HE MISSED THE YELLOW WELL 
PLAYED 
WELL THAT WAS A GOOD FLICK ON THE 
PINK BELIEVE ME BUT FOR THAT IT 
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SNOOKER HE HE TURNED TO RONNIE AND HE PROBABLY 
SAID SOMETHING LIKE NICE FLICK 
THAT WAS NICE TO SEE BOTH PLAYERS 
HAD A NICE SMILE ABOUT THAT 
HE HAS 
MADE IT A TOUGH SNOOKER TO ESCAPE 
FROM NOW 
YES THE BROWN IS IN THE 
WAY OF THE TWO CUSHION ESCAPE 
NORMALLY YOU WOULD COME OFF THAT 
LINE BUT THE BROWN IS IN THE WAY 
IF HE GOES THE OTHER SIDE THAT IS 
SO TRICKY AS WELL HE COULD EASILY 
HIT THE BLACK IT REALLY IS TOUGH 
THIS THAT IS THE OTHER WAY HE 
COULD TRY AND HIT THE RED BUT HE 
HAS TO BE SO PREP PRECISE 
WHICHEVER SIDE OF THE TABLE HE GOES 
THAT IS THE SORT OF LINE I THINK 
WITH A LITTLE TOUCH OF SIDE 
HE NEEDED TO MISS THE BLUE HE 
DIDN'T 
MARK WILLIAMS WILL BE GLAD DIDN'T TO COME TO THE TABLE AND BE ABLE TO 
SEE THE RED 
THIS IS ANOTHER GOOD EFFORT BUT 
MARK WILLIAMS WELL YOU HAVE 
ALREADY SEEN HE KNOWS HIS WAY 
ROUND THE SNOOKER TABLE HE IS SO 
GOOD AT THE ANGLES THIS IS A BIT 
EASIER 
I THINK HIS ONLY CONCERN WAS THAT 
HE MIGHT HAVE LEFT AN EASY SNOOKER 
ON FOR RONNIE 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER 
RONNIE COULD STUN OF THE RIGHT HAND 
SIDE CUSHION GETTING IN BEHIND THE 
BLUE IF HE 
COULD THAT 
WOULD BE A 
REALLY GOOD SNOOKER THAT IS THE 
THING YOU ARE TRYING TO GET A 
SNOOKER THAT 
FORCES YOUR OPPONENT 
TO MISS IT 
I AM JUST WONDERING IF 
THERE IS 
ENOUGH ROOM 
TO GET 
IN 
BEHIND THE BLUE IF NOT IT 
HAVE TO BE THE BROWN AND GREEN IT 
WAS A BIT TIGHT WASN'T IT IT WAS 
CLOSE TO THE CUSHION BUT HE DID 
TRY IT AS YOU SAY 
JOHN IF 
HE 
GOT IN 
BEHIND IT 
IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN SO DIFFICULT TO ESCAPE FROM 
I THINK THAT WAS A MISTAKE RONNIE 
AS HE PASSES MARK SAYS HE FEELS AS 
IF HE WANTS IT AND MARK OF COURSE 
WILL TAKE IT ONCE AGAIN THE MAN 
IN FRONT HE MANAGED TO CRAWL OVER 
THE LINE 
IT IS ONE TO ONE 
I KNOW RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HAS A HUGE 
FAN BASE IN MARK WILLIAMS'S CORNER 
A CERTAIN JOE CALZAGHE IT HIS BEST 
IT IS HIS GREAT MATE HE IS NO HE 
IS A GREAT SNOOKER PLAYER TOO WE 
WILL GET A CHANCE TO SEE JOE 
CALZAGHE'S RECENT HANDIWORK IN THE 
RING IN LAS VEGAS TOMORROW 
L. N. THE SPORTING ARENA SOME NAMES 
WILL BE FORGOTTEN OTHERS WILL LIVE 
FOREVER A CAREER CARVED OUT OVER 
FIFTEEN YEARS UNDEFEATED JOE KARZAI 
KEY AGAINST HOPKINS THE WHOLE 
FIGHT APT MIDDAY THIS SUNDAY ON B. B. C. 
TWO MIDDAY WATCH A MAN 
BECOME A LEGEND 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT OF COURSE 
BACK TO THE SNOOKER JOE CALZAGHE 
IS DOUBTLESS WATCHING HIS GREAT 
FRIEND MARK WILLIAMS WHAT DO YOU 
THINK WHEN MARK SUDDENLY GOES AHEAD 
WITH THAT UNDER ARM SHOT ARE YOU 
PULLING YOUR HAIR AT WHEN YOU SEE 
HIM DO THIS 
NO HE IS ACTUALLY 
VERY GOOD AT IT IT IS 
NOT JUST 
POTTING THE BALLS HE CAN PUT THE 
SPIN ON 
AS WELL 
BUT IT 
DOES NOT 
ALWAYS WORK OUT HE PLAYED WELL IN 
THE U. K. CHAMPIONSHIPS AGAINST 
MAGUIRE AIR IN TELFORD 
HE IS 
FRIGHTENED IN CASE IT GOES WRONG 
BUT HE IS VERY STRONG AT IT HE HAS 
BUTCHERED IT IN THE PAST BUT THERE 
HE IS AT IT AGAIN 
HE WILL NOT BE 
WHIPPED MERCILESSLY IN A MATCH OF 
THIS STATURE 
WELL NOT TONIGHT 
HAD YOU RATE THE PROGRESS OF YOUR 
MAN IN THAT SECOND FRAME AGAIN 
VERY TIGHT 
THAT IS A BIG FRAME HE 
DID NOT SETTLE IN THE FIRST FRAME 
HE ALMOST LOST THAT FRAME THAT 
WILL SETTLE HIM NOW 
BACK TO JOHN AND DENNIS 
THAT IS PRETTY POOR BREAK OFF SHOT 
RONNIE MADE A SIXTY ONE IN THE SHOT OPENING FRAME MARK MADE A SIXTY FIVE IN 
THE SECOND FRAME WHAT A SITTER 
YOU SEE THAT HAS GOT RONNIE OUT 
HAVE HIS SEAT VERY QUICKLY INDEED 
OUT OF IT IS ALL ABOUT PUTTING 
YOUR OPPONENT UNDER PRESSURE MARK 
HAD A CHANCE THERE 
HE JUST STRUGGLED IN ONCE AGAIN 
WE SEE THE TALENTS OF RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN LEFT HANDED RIGHT 
HANDED COMMIT IT IS AMAZING RIGHT 
HANDED RIGHT 
HANDED IF YOU 
HAVE GOT IT IN YOUR ARMOURY WHY 
NOT USE IT 
ABSOLUTELY HE 
PRACTICES ENOUGH WITH IT 
LET'S JUST SEE WHICH RED HE PLAYS 
FOR HERE HE WANTS TO OPEN THE 
BUNCH COMMEND HE HAS LEFT THE RED 
TO THE BACK OF THE BUNCH SO HE CAN 
SPREAD THEM AND STILL FISH ON THE 
BLACK FINISH ON THE BLACK 
DIDN'T PUSH IT THROUGH HE DIDN'T 
GET ENOUGH TOP SPIN ON THAT HE HE PLAYED A LITTLE STUN IT TO TRY AND 
OPEN MORE REDS 
THIS IS A THIN ONE BUT IT IS 
THERE TERRIFIC SHOT BUT WHERE IS 
THE NEXT RED COMING FROM 
HE CAN TAKE THAT RED BUT HE WOULD 
HAVE TO AVOID THE BLACK 
HE GOT THE CANNON HE WAS PERFECTLY 
ON THE BLACK HE HASN'T SETTLED YET RONNIE 
THERE WAS A FEW TIMES IN THE LAST 
FRAME AND THE FIRST FRAME WHEN 
THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE PACE OF 
THE TABLE BUT HE PLAYED THAT 
NICELY INCH PERFECT MAKES IT A 
MUCH EASIER IF YOU COULD COULD 
CONTROL OF THAT CUE BALL HE IS O. K. 
OH WHAT A KICK WHAT A KICK THAT 
IS ALL YOU NEED YOU GOT YOURSELF 
INTO A POSITION TO GO ON AND TAKE 
FOR FRAME AND THAT HAPPENS TAKE 
THE FRAME 
HE HAS GOT TO SIT THERE AND SUFFER 
THAT WAS UNLUCKY 
BUT KNOWING THE WAY THINGS ARE I'M 
SURE IT WILL EVEN HELD THAT IS WHY 
WE SAY THIS IS THE TRUE TEST 
YOU JUST HOPE IT EVENS OUT JUST 
MISSED THE CANNON HE GAVE THE 
TABLE A BANG L. DON'T THINK YOU 
NEEDED TO DO THAT JUST ANNOYED 
THAT HE MISSED THE CANNON ON THE 
RED HE COULD HAVE DONE A BIT OF 
DAMAGE TO HIS CUE HERE IT WAS THE 
BUTT END OF THE CUE 
HE MAY BE ABLE 
TO MAKE THE PLANT HERE NOT A GOOD 
SIGN TO SEE RONNIE DOING THAT 
HE WANTS PERFECTION ALL THE TIME 
AND SOMETIMES HE CANNOT GET IT HE 
LOOKS OUT OF SORTS BECAUSE THAT IS 
NOT A GOOD SAFETY SHOT 
GOING BACK TO THAT KICK WE HAVE 
BEEN GOING COMING HERE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN 
AND I HAVE PLAYED A LOT OF YEARS 
HERE WE DIDN'T GET KICKS BACK THEN 
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TABLE PETER'S 
THE TABLES ARE STILL PLAYED QUICKLY 
IT REALLY HAS TO BE LOOKED AT I 
FEEL L. WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE TABLE 
HEAT IS BEING SWITCHED OFF AND SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS THAT IS PRETTY GOOD 
HE IS LOOKING TO SEE IF THE TWO 
REDS ARE IN A LINE BUT HE CANNOT 
GET PAST THE PINK HE WILL HAVE TO 
SWERVE TO GET TO THEM L. DON'T 
THINK THAT IS ONE MAYBE JUST TO 
NESTLE ON THE RED THAT IS CLOSEST 
TO THE CUSHION THAT IS AS GOOD A 
SHOT AS ANY 
BIPLANE THAT SHOT HE COULDN'T PUT 
ANY PRESSURE ON MARK WILLIAMS'S 
SAFETY BUT IT IS JUST A CONTAINING 
ONE THIS IS VERY TENSE START 
DIDN'T EXPECT THE SNOOKER TO BE 
LIKE THIS WE ARE USED TO QUICK 
FIRE POTTING BREAK BUILDING MARK 
DECIDED HE WOULD GO FOR THAT HE 
WOULD COVER THE RED BUT A CONTRAST 
TO WHAT FRAMES WE WERE EXPECTING I 
THINK 
AND WE HAVE REACHED 
A BIT OF THINK A STALEMATE NOW THAT THE RED HAS 
GONE ACROSS TO THE CORNER POCKET 
RONNIE IF HE DECIDES TO COME UP 
THE TABLE HE HAS GOT TO MAKE SURE 
HE COVERS THAT ONE 
ANOTHER RED HAS COME TO THE RESCUE 
BUT MARK WILL TAKE IT ON I FEEL 
HE CAN HAVE A GO AT THE POT HERE I 
COULD FINISH ON THE BLACK BELIEVE 
IT OR NOT HE HIT IT FAR TOO THICK 
IF YOU GET THE POT HE DOESN'T GO 
IN OFF NOW WHAT A CHANCE FOR 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
HE COMES TO THE TABLE EIGHT POINTS 
IN FRONT 
IF YOU WERE PUTTING THE WON THE 
TABLE AS PRACTICE TO CLEAR UP 
YOU WOULDN'T PUT THEM ANY BETTER 
THAN THIS PUTTING THEM ON THE 
TABLE 
PROBABLY PLAY FOR THE BLUE TABLE THIS TIME 
HE HAS GONE A BIT FAR FOR THE BLUE 
BUT THE PINK WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE 
THERE ALSO 
HE WORKED IT OUT BRILLIANTLY HE GOT A GENEROUS ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
FOR THAT BLACK HE WANTED TO GET 
CLOSER TO THE YELLOW TO MAKE IT 
EASIER 
THIRTY POINTS THE DIFFERENCE TWO 
SNOOKER IS NEEDED TWO SNOOKERS 
THERE IS A CHANCE TO GET IN BEHIND 
THE BLACK HERE 
YOU CANNOT POT THE BLUE IT IS 
GIVES YOU ONE LESS BALL TO SNOOKER 
BEHIND NOT HARD ENOUGH BY A LONG 
WAY 
IN FACT THAT HAS HELPED THE 
SITUATION NOW THE PINK IS NEARER 
THE BLACK A BIT OF A CHANCE HERE TOO THIN 
THAT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT 
DANGEROUS 
I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO DANGEROUS KNOCK THE BLACK ONTO THE TOP CUSHION 
I THINK AS LONG AS YOU NEED 
DISTANCE BETWEEN CUE BALL AND 
OBJECT BALL THEN NO SNOOKER IS 
GOING TO BE EASY TO GET 
IF HE 
NEEDED A COUPLE OF SNOOKERS RONNIE 
WOULD ROLL THE BLUE OVER THE CORNER 
POCKET BUT HE CANNOT AFFORD TO DO 
IT BECAUSE MARK WOOD POTTED AND 
THEN HE WOULD ONLY NEED ONE SNOOKER 
TO WIN BECAUSE MARK WOULD POT IT 
HE HAS OVER CUT IT LET'S SEE IF 
MARK POT THE BLUE AND THEN LOOKS 
FOR THAT SNOOKER POTS THE BLUE 
HE CAN WIN WITH ONE SNOOKER NOW I I NEVER ADVOCATE THOUGH IF YOU CAN 
AVOID IT DON'T POT THE BLUE 
IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOUR OPPONENT 
WILL ROLL IT OVER THE POCKET NOW 
RONNIE PROBABLY TO THE FAR LEFT 
CORNER ALTHOUGH PERHAPS HE FANCIES 
PUTTING IN THE MIDDLE THERE YOU GO 
FAR LEFT POCKET VERY DIFFICULT NOW 
TO GET THE SNOOKER FROM HERE 
THIS HAS GOT A CHANCE I TELL YOU 
WHAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN BEHIND 
IT THIS IS CLOSE YES 
THAT WAS A PRETTY TENSE A FRIEND 
IT COULD HAVE GONE EITHER WAY TENSE FRAME 
THIS MATCH IS INTRIGUINGLY TACTICAL 
SO FAR WHAT IS YOUR READING OF IT 
IT IS TOTALLY UNEXPECTED WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IS THAT THE PLAYER WHO 
GETS IN FRONT IS NOT CLINCHING THE 
FRAME SO THE OTHER PLAYER IS 
TRYING TO GET SNOOKERS AND SLOWING 
THINGS UP IT HAS NOT BEEN THE 
QUICK FIRE STUFF WE HAVE EXPECTED 
LET'S LOOK AT THE TURNING POINT IN 
THAT FRAME 
IT WAS A TACTICAL DUEL 
WITH THREE REDS OUT MARK WAS 
FORCED TO GO WITH THAT YOU COULD 
SAY HE'S UNLUCKY TO GO IN OFF TO 
BE HONEST WITH YOU HE MISSED THE 
RED BY SO FAR HE COULDN'T COMPLAIN 
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE THE BIG 
BREAKS THEY LIKE TO SEE THESE MEN 
STROKING IN BIG BREAKS BUT 
ACTUALLY IT IS ENJOYABLE WHEN WE 
HAVE TENS DECIDERS 
AS LONG AS YOU 
GET THE TWISTS AND TURNS RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN GOT SOME GREAT SNOOKER'S 
IN THE FIRST FRAME OR THE SECOND 
FRAME WHEN MARK WAS SAFE L. THINK 
EVERYBODY ENJOYS THAT THERE IS A 
FEW BREAKS IN THERE AS WELL SO WE 
ARE HAVING A GOOD MIX 
IT IS NOT 
OFTEN THAT WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE 
YOU GET A CHANCE TO REFLECT ON PAST 
RECORD BUT WE HAVE GOT THE LUXURY 
OF DOING THAT WHEN MARK THINKS 
ABOUT IT HIS LAST VICTORY OVER 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN STRANGELY WAS 
TWO THOUSAND ONE IN THE THAILAND MASTERS THAT 
IS A LONG TIME TO NOT HAVE PLAYED 
REALLY THAT OFTEN IT IS HARD TO 
GAUGE THE PATTERN 
YOU NORMALLY GET 
THE SAME SORT OF STYLE GAME WITH 
RONNIE SO MARK WILL NOT BE TOO 
WORRIED ABOUT THAT BUT RONNIE 
NEVER CHANGES HIS GAME IS ALWAYS 
SIMILAR 
I THINK RONNIE'S GAME HAS CHANGED 
IN FAIRNESS L. DON'T THINK AT THE 
TURN OF THE CENTURY I SUPPOSE IT 
WAS WAS PREPARED TO BATTLE HARD 
FRAMES AND PLAY THIS TYPE OF 
TACTICAL GAME EUROPE'S WHITLEY ROAD 
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT HE DOES 
BATTLE A LOT MORE 
THIS IS A TOUGH ONE BUT THEY DON'T 
HALF BOOST YOUR CONFIDENCE IF THEY 
GO IN HE HAS HIT ITS SO THICK HE 
HAS LEFT MARK WILLIAMS RIGHT IN 
AMONGST THEM 
AND IT IS SHOTS LIKE THAT THAT 
REALLY NIGGLE AND THEN WAIT RONNIE 
AND WE RONNIE HE'S ALWAYS 
WANTING TO ENTERTAIN SOMETIMES IT 
DOESN'T HAPPEN AND I THINK IT 
CONFUSE HIM A LITTLE BIT 
CONFUSES HIM 
BECAUSE MARK WILLIAMS HAS HAD 
PLENTY OF CHANCES HERE 
HE HAS 
PLAYED A POOR POSITIONAL SHOT THERE 
ONE OF THE BEST RULERS OF THE BALL 
LORD WILLIAMS 
A DELICATE JOB FOR THE REFEREE 
THERE YOU NEED BE DELICATE HAND 
A DELICATE HAND TRYING TO GET AS 
CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL SPOT AS 
POSSIBLE WELL SPOTTED 
THAT HAS CLEARED THE BLACK THAT IS 
A VERY CLEVER SHOT FROM RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN 
THAT COULD BE A TELLING SAFETY SHOT 
CAN HE GET INTO THE MAIN BUNCH 
THESE CAN ALWAYS GO WRONG YOU CAN 
BEND IT A BIT TOO MUCH OR NOT 
ENOUGH 
HE BENT IT LIKE BACK AND THEN YES YES BUT HE WAS A BIT THICK THAT IS WHY 
HE CAUGHT THE GREEN 
WHAT DID OUTCOME THAT IS WHAT AN 
OUTCOME THAT IS LOOK WHERE HE HAS 
DROPPED 
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS HE 
HAS HIS THREE REDS AND FINISHED PERFECTLY ON THE BLACK 
YOU HAVE GOT TO CAPITALISE ON A BIT 
OF GOOD FORTUNE LIKE THAT THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL IS COMING UP 
JUST O. K. HE IS A BIT CLOSER TO THE 
BLUE THAN HE INTENDED 
HE IS SLIGHTLY HAMPERED BY THE PINK 
HE CAN PLAY THE PINK INTO THE 
MIDDLE POCKET BUT IT WOULD THEN BE 
LOST ON THE TABLE AND WOULD GO ON 
THE BROWN SPOT HE WANTS TO KEEP 
THE PINK ON THIS END THE REASON 
FOR THAT IS IF HE JUST GETS A 
PROBLEM THE PINK WILL COME TO HIS 
RESCUE THIS IS A GOOD CHANCE 
A NICE KISS ON THE PINK I THINK I 
WOULD PLAY THE PINK THIS TIME 
HE IS NOT BOTHERED ABOUT LOSING THE 
PINK NOW THE HIGHEST AVAILABLE WAS 
THE BROWN SPOT WITH THESE FOUR 
REPRESENTATIVE FOUR REDS IN THE 
OPEN MORE THAN ENOUGH TO CLINCH 
THE FRAME 
MARK WILL BE QUITE PLEASED AT GOING 
INTO THE MID SESSION INTERVAL AT 
TWO TO TWO 
HE IS FURTHER AWAY FROM THIS TWO TO TWO RED THAN HE WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT IT 
IS IN THE BLUE WOULD HAVE PUT HIM 
SIXTY EIGHT POINTS IN FRONT WITH SIXTY SEVEN LEFT 
ANYTHING ELSE AND HE NEEDS ANOTHER 
RED AFTER THE COLOUR 
HE MIGHT STILL BE A ABLE TO NIP 
THIS GREEN IN BUT IT MUST BE A BIT 
ON THE FINNISH SIDE THINNISH WELL PLAYED SIXTY EIGHT AHEAD SIXTY SEVEN REMAINING 
IN ALMOST EVERY FRAME WE HAVE SEEN 
SOMEBODY TRYING TO GET SNOOKERS BUT 
WHOEVER HAS BEEN AHEAD HAS WON THE 
FRAME COULD WE SEE A TWIST IN THIS 
ONE 
A WELL TAKING FIFTY FIVE HE WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED HE DID NOT PUT THE 
FRAME BEYOND THE REACH OF RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN RONNIE NEEDS ONE 
SNOOKER 
TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT 
ANOTHER RED NEAR THE SIDE CUSHION 
SO THAT THE FRAUD RONNIE DOES GET 
AN OPPORTUNITY IT WILL BE 
DIFFICULT TO POCKET REDS AND BLACKS 
HAVING KISSED THE BLUE HE HAS LEFT 
A CHANCE OF THIS RED IF MARK 
POCKETS THE RED THAT WILL BE ENOUGH 
FOR RONNIE AND WE WILL GO TO THE 
MIDSESSION INTERVAL 
THAT WAS A CLEVER SHOT FROM RONNIE 
PURPOSELY PLAYED 
IN GOES THE RED AND THAT WILL DO I 
THINK 
IT HAS BEEN INTRIGUING AND 
ENTHRALLING THESE FIRST FOUR 
FRAMES FOUR WATER BE PLAYED AFTER 
THE MID SESSION INTERVAL FOR 
MORE TO BE PLAYED BOTH PLAYERS 
HAVE SETTLED IN 
AN EXHIBITION SHOT THERE FROM MARK 
AND WHAT A GOOD WHEN IT WAS ONE 
IT WAS 
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE UNDER 
OUR SHORTS HOW DO THEY DO THAT 
UNDERARM SHOTS 
RONNIE SAYS I HAVE 
HAD ENOUGH AND MARK SAYS O. K. BUT 
THAT WAS A NICE FLOURISH AT THE END 
BOTH HEADING BACK TO THEIR DRESSING 
ROOMS GIVE WAS AN EXCLUSIVE WILL 
YOU TALK OR LISTEN WITH MARK 
WILLIAMS IN THE DRESSING ROOM I I WILL ASSESS HOW HE FEELS AT THE 
MOMENT HE SHOULD NOT FEEL TOO 
UNHAPPY BOTH PLAYERS HAD A CHANCE 
TO WIN EVERY FLAKE EVERY FRAME 
AT TWO TO TWO THEY WILL BE COMFORTABLE 
YOU CAN NIP OFF AND WE CAN DIGEST 
MORE NEWS FROM THIS COMPETITION IT 
WAS STEPHEN HENDRY WHO WAS THE LAST 
MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO RETAIN THIS 
WORLD TITLE BUT THAT WILL NOT 
HAPPEN THIS YEAR THAT RECORD WILL 
REMAIN BECAUSE THE DEFENDING 
CHAMPION JOHN HIGGINS IS OUT HE 
WAS BITTEN BY AN INSPIRED WELSHMAN 
RYAN DAY THE WORLD NUMBER SIXTEEN 
THROUGH WINNING THIRTEEN NINE THIS WAS 
CERTAINLY RYAN'S DAY 
I AM 
DELIGHTED IT WAS A TOUGH GAME FOR 
ME WHEN JOIN GOT OFF TO THE START 
THAT HE DID I HAD TO DIG IN 
WHEN JOHN THERE IS LOTS OF TIME 
FOR THINGS TO TOM TURN AND I 
TOOK MY CHANCES 
AT THE END OF THE 
DAY RYAN PLAYED FANTASTIC L. WAS 
GIVEN SOME CHANCES YOU HAVE GOT TO 
TAKE AT THIS LEVEL AND I DIDN'T DO 
IT NO COMPLAINTS MEANWHILE MEANWHILE ANOTHER SCOT MARCHES ON STEPHEN 
HENDRY BOOKED HIS QUARTER FINAL 
PLACE FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS 
FOR THREE YEARS BEATING DING 
JUNHUI 
IT WAS IMPORTANT PLAYING SOMEONE 
LIKE BEING TO GET ON TOP OF HIM 
EARLY THERE ARE LOT OF PLAYERS 
PLAYING AT THE CRUCIBLE L. L. HAVE 
SEEN HIS HEAD GO DOWN WHEN PEOPLE 
GO ON OF THEM I THOUGHT THAT I MIGHT 
BE ABLE 
TO 
ADVANTAGE AND 
IT WORKED OUT THAT 
WAY 
STEPHEN HENDRY THROUGH TO HIS WAY SEVENTEENTH CRUCIBLE QUARTER FINAL ONE ONE OTHER MATCH INVOLVING TWO THOUSAND FIVE CHAMPION 
SHAUN MURPHY WHOSE HOPES WERE 
HANGING BY A THREAD AGAINST A 
QUALIFIED PILOT ALI CARTER CARTER 
WAS IN COMMAND LEADING TWELVE TO FOUR GOING 
INTO THIS EVENING'S EVENING SESSION 
SESSION 
IT WOULD BE NICE IF CARTER COULD 
SAVE THOSE LOOKS FOR WHEN HE REALLY 
NEEDS THEM RATHER WHEN HE IS TWELVE TO FOUR 
AHEAD 
I WAS WATCHING SHAUN MURPHY AHEAD WHEN THAT FLUKE WENT IN HE WAS 
COMPLETELY WITHOUT EMOTION WHICH 
IS TESTAMENT TO HIM IT GOT A 
TERRIBLE KISS THEN A KICK ON THE 
PINK WHICH HE PLAYED SAFE OFF 
THAT SUMS UP SOMEONE WHO IS SO FAR 
BEHIND'S LUCK SNOOKER HAS NEVER 
BEEN ANY DIFFERENT THE WORK 
GENERALLY GOES WITH THE PLAYER WHO 
DOESN'T NEED IT LUCK 
JUST THINKING ABOUT WHEN ALI CARTER 
BEAT BARRY HAWKINS HE COULD NOT 
GET ACROSS THE LINE IN THE FIRST 
ROUND 
IT WAS 
LIKE THERE 
WAS SOME 
BARRIER THAT HE COULD NOT 
THROUGH MAYBE NOW HE HAS GOT WAR 
THAT MATCH OR WERE THAT MATCH 
HE SEEMS TO HAVE GOT THE MONKEY OFF 
HIS BACK IN 
SEEMS ABLE 
TO JUST 
PLACE TO COME OUT 
CARTER IS THE 
ONLY MEMBER OF THE TOP SIXTEEN WHO HAS 
NEVER APPEARED IN A WORLD RANKING 
FINAL HE IS A GOOD ENOUGH PLAYER 
MAYBE IT HAS BEEN A FEW OF THOSE 
MENTAL BARRIERS YOU WERE HINTING AT 
WHICH HAS BEEN THE PROBLEM 
ANYONE WILL TELL YOU THAT A LOT OF 
SNOOKER IS IN THE MIND ALL OF THE 
GAZE AT THIS CHAMPIONSHIP A 
WONDERFUL SNOOKER PLAYERS BUT IT IS 
THE OTHER PART THAT IS AS IMPORTANT 
AND I THINK ALI CARTER HAS 
STRUGGLED WITH THAT IN THE CLOSE 
MATCHES HE HAS LOST THERE IS NO 
DOUBT ABOUT THAT THIS WOULD GIVE 
HANN A HUGE BOOST IF HE COULD GET 
OVER THE LINE BY SUCH A HUGE MARGIN 
AGAINST A PLAYER WHO IS UNDOUBTEDLY 
ONE OF 
THE VERY BEST AND THE WORLD 
IN THE WORLD 
HE HAD TO INJECT SOME PACE BUT THAT 
WAS STILL A PRETTY EASY BALL 
AND THIS HIP SAFETY FROM MURPHY MISHIT SAFETY 
IT IS PROBABLY VERY FRUSTRATING 
OVER THE TWO SESSIONS HE HAS REALLY 
LOST THIS MATCH BARRING SOME KIND 
OF MIRACLE 
STRAIGHT ON THE BLUE IT IS A BALL 
POCKET NOT TOO BAD BLUE TO MIDDLE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER 
CARTER WAS WITHIN A FRAME OF 
REACHING THE SEMI FINALS LAST YEAR 
HE CAME FROM TEN TO SIX DOWN THAT WAS 
HIS MATCH AGAINST MARK SELBY WHICH 
WENT THE DISTANCE TO TWENTY FIVE FRAMES 
BEFORE MARK SELBY ONE THIRTEEN TO TWELVE 
CARTER CUEING VERY NICELY HE GOT A 
LOT OF REACTION THEN ON THE CUE 
BALL WITH LITTLE APPARENT DEFAULT 
BEAUTIFUL SHOT THERE HAVE BEEN ONE 
OR TWO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TABLES 
I THINK THIS TABLE APPEARS TO HAVE 
PLAYED SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE 
OTHER ONE FOR SOME REASON THE 
STANDARD HAS BEEN HIGHER ON THIS 
TABLE ONE HALF OF THE DRAW HAS 
BEEN PLAYING BETTER THE BOTTOM 
HALF AS OPPOSED TO THE TOP HALF 
THE TOP HALF HAS BEEN PLAYED ON THE 
OTHER TABLE 
THERE HAVE NOT BEEN SO 
MANY SPRINGY BOUNCES THAT IS FOR 
SURE 
I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE BEING SURE RECOVERED AFTER TONIGHT'S PLAY SO 
PRESUMABLY THEY WILL BE AS GOOD AS 
NEW AGAIN 
BUT ALI CARTER SEEMS TO BE 
PERFECTLY AT HOME 
YOU COULD SAY HE WAS LUCKY WITH 
THAT CANNON L. DO NOT THINK HE 
PLAYED IT AS WELL AS HE COULD HAVE 
DONE LUCKILY FOR HIM THE BLACK 
HAS BEEN PUSHED AWAY FROM THE SPOT 
AND THE RED STILL GOES 
JUST THINKING ABOUT IF HE GOES ON 
TO WIN FOURTEEN TO FOUR THIS WILL BE HIS BEST 
WHEN FINAL HE BEAT STEPHEN HENDRY 
THIRTEEN SECS LAST YEAR STEPHEN WAS NOT 
THAT HIS BEST THEN THIS IS A 
RESOUNDING VICTORY HE IS ABOUT TO 
COMPLETE 
YES OF VICTORY OVER A PLAYER WHO 
HAS COME HERE AS PROVISIONAL MUM 
WORLD NUMBER ONE HAS REACHED THE 
QUARTER FINALS OR BETTER IN HIS 
LAST NINE OR TEN RANKING EVENTS AND 
HAS REACHED FIVE SEMI FINALS 
MANY PEOPLE WHO BET ON SNOOKER 
MIGHT HAVE A BIT ON CORRECT SCORE 
BETTING L. DO NOT THINK MANY 
BOOKMAKERS WILL BE PAYING OUT ON 
THIRTEEN TO FOUR TWO ALI CARTER 
HE HAS DEVELOPED THE MATCH WINNING 
RED 
FIFTY SIX IN FRONT WITH A SIMPLE COLOUR TO 
COME ONLY FIFTY ONE LEFT ON THE TABLE FOR 
HIS OPPONENT 
AS LONG AS CARTER SIMPLY MAKES SURE 
OF THIS RED THERE WILL SIMPLY BE 
TOO MANY SNOOKERS REQUIRED FOR 
MURPHY TO HAVE EVEN AN OUTSIDE 
CHANCE OF SNATCHING THE FRAME 
YES THOROUGHLY OUTPLAYED WELL 
PLAYED AND IT WAS WELL PLAYED 
HAVE NEVER SEEN CARTER PLAY BETTER 
AND IN A MORE SUSTAINED WAY ALI 
CARTER BEATS SHAUN MURPHY BY THIRTEEN TO FOUR 
TO GO FORWARD TO THE QUARTER FINALS 
I PLAYED WELL L. PLAYED WELL 
YESTERDAY PLAYED BETTER YESTERDAY 
THAN I DID TODAY SHAUN DID NOT 
PERFORM YESTERDAY IT WAS DOWN TO 
ME PUTTING HIM UNDER PRESSURE BUT 
TODAY HE HAD A FEW CHANCES BUT I 
WAS ABLE TO 
TAKE MINE 
AND 
CAPITALISE THEM ON THEM L. PLEASED TO BE IN 
ANOTHER QUARTER 
FINAL 
A LOT 
OF 
IT WAS 
JUST MY AND POOR 
PLAY L. WILL 
HOLD MY 
HANDS 
UP AND 
SAY I 
HAVE WORKED VERY HARD AND 
PLAYED VERY WELL BUT I HAD A BAD 
SESSION BUT SIX TO TWO IS LOT BETTER 
THAN TWELVE TO FOUR STILL FELT 
I WAS STILL 
IN THE MATCH FELT I HAD A CHANCE 
THINK MY 
DAY 
WAS SUMMED 
UP IN 
THE FIRST 
FRAME WHERE I GOT 
IN OFF ALI CARTER'S BREAK OFF 
SPLIT THE REDS UP PERFECTLY AND 
HAD A REALLY BAD KICK ON THE RED 
THAT SUMS IT UP 
IF YOU ARE IN FINE 
YOU THINK YOU ARE 
AND HAVE THE MATCH TO 
LOSE L. COULD NOT SLEEP L. JUST 
CHILLED OUT IN MY ROOM AND GOT 
PREPARE FOR TONIGHT IT WAS 
NICE TO 
GO 
OUT THERE 
AND 
NOT HAVE 
TO 
TO GET 
A CHANCE 
AND 
TAKE IT 
AND WIN 
WELL DONE TO HIM SHAUN MURPHY'S 
DEPARTURE LOOKS LIKELY TO SCUPPER 
HIS CHANCES OF BECOMING THE WORLD 
NO ONE FOR NEXT SEASON THAT IS A SORE ONE FOR HIM 
SEEN A DIFFERENT SIDE OF IT ALI 
CARTER IS ONE OF YOUR CHARGES HOW 
DO THINK HE PLAYED 
TO BEAT SHAUN 
MURPHY THIRTEEN FOUR IS AN EXCEPTIONAL 
RESULT L. THINK IT WILL BOOST TO 
MARK TREMENDOUSLY L. THINK HE 
PLAYED IT VERY WELL AND ARE PLAY 
SHAUN MURPHY IN ALL DEPARTMENTS 
THAT IS A HUGE BOOST IT WILL 
BOOST MARK TREMENDOUSLY 
IS IT 
SOMETHING YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ON 
WITH HIM 
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME WE 
TALK BEFORE THE START HE IS A GOOD 
PLAYER HIS WIN AGAINST BARRY 
HAWKINS WHEN HE WAS TAKEN OFF AND 
HAD TO WAIT THREE HOURS THAT WAS 
HUGE FOR HIM 
BACK TO THE MATCH WE 
HAVE BEEN ENJOYING TONIGHT ANY 
WORDS OF WISDOM YOU IMPARTED TO 
MARK WILLIAMS DURING THE INTERVAL 
YOU WERE KNOCKING THE BALLS AROUND 
DURING THE BREAK 
WE CAME BACK AND 
HERE HE WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE HE HE NEVER STANDSTILL 
NOT MUCH TIME REMAINING HERE ON B. B. C. 
TWO HE NEVER STANDS STILL WE 
WILL RETURN YOU NOW TO JOHN AND 
DENNIS IN THE BOX 
SO EVERYTHING HAS SETTLED DOWN 
AGAIN 
THE CROWD HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE ARE 
REALLY ENJOYING THIS TUSSLE THERE 
ARE LOT OF RONNIE FANS HERE BUT 
A LOT OF WELSH SUPPORTERS AS WELL 
DID YOU SPOT THE DIFFERENCE THERE 
DENNIS WHEN RONNIE BROKE OFF 
D. HE 
BREAK OFF WITH HIS RIGHT HAND HE HE DID THE FIRST TIME FOR A LONG TIME 
DID HE THE LAST RAKE OFF HE MADE 
BEFORE THE MID SESSION INTERVAL 
WITH HIS LEFT HAND IT WAS A POOR 
ONE AND LAST BREAK OFF JUST A 
LITTLE CHANGE OF TACK 
HE HAS A 
CHANCE HERE IF THIS GOES IN HE IS 
ON THE BLACK AT LEAST FIVE REDS ARE AVAILABLE 
HE MAY HAVE FINISHED A LITTLE 
STRAIGHT ON THIS HE SHOULD BE O. K. 
THOUGH IT JUST MEANT HE HAD TO 
POT LOOK AT THE BOUNCE OFF THE 
CUSHION THERE HE DID NOT GET ON 
THE RED AS HE INTENDED THAT WHITE 
HAS JUST THROWN OFF THAT SIDE 
CUSHION FLOWN OFF NOW HE HAS A 
VERY DELICATE CUT BACK A GOOD RECOVERY 
YES IT WAS A GOOD POT ON THE BLACK 
BUT IT IS AWKWARD CUEING HERE WHAT 
COLOUR CAN HE GET ON OFF THIS RED 
HE JUST MANAGED TO DROP IT IN AND 
HOLD FOR THE BLACK HE HAS GOT TO 
BE CAREFUL WITH BLACKS LIKE THIS IN IT WENT 
HE GOT THE EASY RED TO THE LEFT 
MIDDLE 
NO PROBLEM HERE JUST OFF THE SIDE 
CUSHION THERE WILL BE A COUPLE OF 
REDS AVAILABLE 
STILL NO NEED TO GO INTO THEM JUST 
YET 
THE ONLY THING HE HAD TO AVOID WAS 
LEAVING HIMSELF AWKWARD 
HE PLAYS THAT SHOT SO WELL IF 
THERE IS A RED IN THE MIDDLE THAT 
WILL GO HE WILL PLAY TO GET ON IT 
IF NOT HE WILL CANNON INTO THE 
MIDDLE OF THE THREE REDS THAT WILL 
OPEN UP HE PLAYED THAT LITTLE 
CANNON AND HE PLAYED IT PERFECTLY 
YES HE JUST STOPPED FOR SECOND 
DIDN'T HE THEN HE WALKED ROUND SO 
YOU CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT YOU ARE 
RIGHT DENNIS HE HAS PLAYED IT 
PERFECTLY HE IS NICELY ON THIS RED 
HE WILL BE COUPLE OF SHOTS AHEAD AFTER THIS RED AND ANOTHER BLACK 
YES HE WAS NOT QUITE SURE THAT WAS 
THE THING TO DO GET UP AGAIN THE 
WORST THING YOU CAN DO IN THIS GAME 
IS TO PLAY A SHOT WHEN YOU HAVE NOT 
QUITE MADE UP YOUR MIND 
HE LOOKED A BIT EDGY AT THE START 
OF THE MATCH BUT AFTER THE 
INTERVAL HE CAME OUT AND THIS WAS 
THE START HE WAS AFTER ALWAYS GOOD 
IF YOU CAN WIN THE FRAME WITH ONE 
VISIT 
HE IS NOT MANY POTS AWAY FROM DOING 
THAT 
HE HAS PLAYED THESE REALLY THAT WELL HE CUED PERFECTLY JUST THE BLACK 
NEEDED TO CLINCH THE FRAME THERE 
IS A POSSIBILITY OF A VERY HIGH 
BREAK HERE 
JOE PERRY STILL HOLDS THE HIGHEST 
BREAK AT THE MOMENT BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO 
THERE ARE PLENTY MORE POINTS TO 
OVERTAKE THAT HERE 
YES IF HE TAKES BLACKS WITH THESE 
REMAINING REDS A POSSIBLE ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
HE IS THE NEAREST ONE TO STEPHEN 
HENDRY IN THE CENTURY'S DEPARTMENT 
HE HAS MAKE FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN STEPHEN HENDRY 
JUST OVER SEVEN HUNDRED HE HAS MADE FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN 
JUST THE BLACK FOR TERRIFIC CENTURY 
BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED PERFECT ON THE 
LAST RED TO PLAY FOR ANOTHER BLACK 
THIS IS WHAT THEY HAVE COME TO SEE 
THIS CROWD 
HE WILL CLEAR THE COLOURS TO SET A 
PRETTY GOOD TARGET JUST EIGHT MINUTES FOR THIS EFFORT 
STUNNING ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN BEATS THE HIGHEST 
BREAK THIS YEAR IN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP HE SET TARGET THAT 
WAS A MAGNIFICENT EFFORT OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY AND 
HE LEADS THREE TO TWO 
WOW THAT WAS EFFORTLESS WE WILL 
HAVE TO LEAVE IT HERE ON B. B. C. TWO
