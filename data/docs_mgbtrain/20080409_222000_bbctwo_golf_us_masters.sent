MOST OF MY CAREER THIS IS MY TWELVE OR

THING LIKE THAT 
I JUST LOVE 
GETTING OUT THERE AND MIXING UP 
WITH THE GUYS THEY ARE TRYING TO 
BE ME I AM TRYING TO BEAT THEM 
BEAT ME 
LAST YEAR I MADE SOME MISTAKES ON 
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN WINNING AND LOSING THIS IS 
A SPECIAL CHAMPIONSHIP L. HAVE HAD SOME NICE MEMORIES HERE 
IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK TIGER IS 
LOOKING INVINCIBLE 
A RUCK OR 
TALENT IT HAS BEEN A DELIGHT TO BE 
AROUND TO THE HIM PLAY 
REMARKABLE TALENT THERE HAVE BEEN 
SOME AMAZING FIGURES IN THE GAME 
DAYS ALWAYS SOMEBODY AND AT THE 
MOMENT TIGER WOODS IS SO FAR AHEAD 
OF ANYBODY ELSE HOW LONG FOR AND 
A KNOW I DON'T KNOW 
HE IS STILL 
YOUNG THAT CHIP AT INSECT YOU 
NEVER TIRE OF SEEING IT 
SUCH A 
HARD SHOT TIGER HAS DONE THAT TIME 
AND TIME AGAIN HE JUST PRODUCES 
THE RIGHT SHOT AT THE RIGHT TIME 
YOU CAN'T SEE PAST HIM THIS WEEK 
BUT HE IS TALKING OF THE GRAND SLAM 
AND THAT IS A MASSIVE ASK HE HIS 
FORM COULDN'T BE BETTER THE THE STRONGEST FAVOURITE EVER 
A YES 
BUT OTHER PEOPLE COULD WIN THIS 
YEAR I HAVE SEEN MORE GOOD LOOKING 
YOUNG PLAYERS THAN EVER BEFORE 
SOME OF THEM HAVE WON EVENTS AND 
THEN DISAPPEAR SO BE IS NO 
CONSISTENCY 
NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WAS EVENTFUL AT CONSISTENCY THE MASTERS ARNOLD PALMER ONE FOR 
THE FIRST TIME AND AMEN CORNER WAS 
BORN THIS HERE WE HAVE EXTENDED 
LIVE ACTION FROM AMEN CORNER AT 
THREE THIRTY P. M. JUST PRESS THE RED BUTTON 
ORDER TO THE WEBSITE 
LAST SUMMER PADRAIG HARRINGTON WON 
HIS FIRST MAJOR THE OPEN AT 
CARNOUSTIE HE MADE HARD WORK OF IT WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT OH NO NO NO 
WELL DONE WELL DONE CARNOUSTIE CARNOUSTIE WAS A TOUGH MAJOR IT WAS FAIR 
LAST TIME THEY DIDN'T MAKE THE 
COURSE AS TOUGH AS THEY COULD HAVE 
THIS IS SIMILAR IN TERMS OF GOOD 
AND BAD BREAKS YOU NEED TO MANAGE 
THE HIGHS AND LOWS YOU WILL MAKE 
SOME EAGLES AND SOME DOUBLE BOGEYS 
EACH WEEK IT IS THERE 
AT THE OPEN THERE IS MORE PRESSURE 
MORE STRESS IT IS HARDER TO GO 
UNDER THE RADAR BUT IT SHOULD MAKE 
IT EASIER IF THEY GET INTO 
CONTENTION HAVING WON ONE ALREADY 
THE FEELING SHOULD BE GOOD COMING 
DOWN THE STRETCH HOPE THE TRADE 
OFF IS A BIT OF EXTRA PRESSURE 
GOING INTO IT 
IF I STICK MY HEAD DOWN AND BITE 
HARDER IT DOESN'T MAKE ME PLAY 
BETTER I AM BETTER WHEN I AM 
SMILING AND ENJOYING IT I MADE BUT 
THE DECISIONS SO I HAVE TO MAKE 
THE EFFORT AND WHERE BETTER THAN 
THE AUGUSTA NATIONAL 
HE MUST BE A 
MASSIVE CHANGE WHEN YOU CAN PUT 
MAJOR WINNER AFTER YOUR NAME IT IT WOULD GIVE YOU A HUGE BOOST IN 
CONFIDENCE HE WON ONE WELL HE 
LIKES AUGUSTA LAST YEAR HE WAS THE 
TOP PUTTER HE HAS A CHANCE AN AN EXTRAORDINARY FINISH AT CARNOUSTIE 
AMAZING BUT YOU CAN HAVE ALL THESE 
WONDERFUL SHOTS BUT YOU STILL NEED 
A BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE IN ANYTHING 
YOU DO 
OF COURSE WE HAD A 
SURPRISE WINNER LAST YEAR 
IT MAY 
HAPPEN THIS YEAR THERE ARE SIX OR 
SEVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE A CHANCE IF 
THEY PUT THEIR GAME TOGETHER HE 
DID IT LAST YEAR 
LAST YEAR THE 
COURSE WAS FAST THAT BRINGS MORE 
PLAYERS INTO THE FIELD NOW IT IS 
DRYING OUT LAST YEAR IT WAS HARD 
FAST AND FIRM THIS YEAR IT IS 
SOFTER 
A GREAT MOMENT FOR ZACH SOFTER JOHNSON 
AFTERWARDS PEOPLE ASKED JOHNSON HIM WHO HE WAS AND HE SAID IT WAS 
I AM AN ORDINARY MAN YOU HAVE 
DECEMBER TO THE PRESSURE TO WIN 
YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT FINISH AND 
STEAL IT OR AVERAGE IN THE PALM OF 
YOUR HANDS AND BLOW IT 
IT IS 
AMAZING HOW OFTEN WE HAVE THESE 
GOOGLE FINISHES WE HAVEN'T HAD A 
MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIP WINNER FROM 
BRITAIN SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE NO SHORTAGE OF 
CONTENDERS THIS YEAR JUSTIN ROSE 
WENT CLOSE LAST YEAR 
EVERYBODY ENJOYS PLAYING AT AUGUSTA 
IT HAS A DIFFERENT FEEL TO IT AND 
AFTER LAST YEAR WHERE I PLAYED 
WELL 
I WANT TO GET BACK IN I WAS THRILLED I PLAYED A REALLY 
NICE ROUND ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I 
HAVE HAD GOOD TIME HERE AT 
AUGUSTA I HAVE PUT MY NAME ON THE 
LEADERBOARD TWO OR THREE TIMES 
THAT IS A VALUABLE EXPERIENCE IT 
IS THE KIND OF GOLF COURSE WHERE 
WHETHER 
YOU HAVE GOOD OR BAD DAY YOU CERTAINLY LEARN FROM IT THERE 
IS SOME TRICKERY TO PLAY THIS GOLF 
COURSE I HAVE LEARNT THE GOOD AND 
BAD HOPEFULLY 
IT IS MY FIRST ONE L. 
AM VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE IT WAS 
A BOYHOOD DREAM IT IS THE DREAM OF 
EVERY YOUNG BOY WHO PLAYS GOLF TO 
COME AND PLAY AT THE MASTERS SO 
THE DREAM IS REALISED AND I LOOK 
FORWARD TO THIS WEEK 
YOU ARE WELL 
FANCY THIS WEEK LEAD LEE 
I DO 
NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ARTICLES BUT 
I FEEL CONFIDENT THE GAME IS IN 
GOOD SHAPE L. AM DRIVING THE BALL 
WELL WHICH IS IMPORTANT AROUND 
HERE I AM STARTING TO HOLE A FEW 
PUTTS HOPEFULLY I WILL BE THERE 
COME SUNDAY AFTERNOON 
YOU HAVE TO 
STAY POSITIVE YOU CANNOT ACCEPT 
BEFORE YOU EVEN GO OUT THAT ONE 
PLAYER WILL WALK AWAY WITH IT 
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT THE MINDSET OF 
A PROFESSIONAL AND IT IS CERTAINLY 
NOT THE MINDSET OF MY OWN L. WILL 
STAY POSITIVE L. KNOW I HAVE A 
CHANCE TO WIN I'D JUST HAVE TO GO 
OUT THERE AND PLAY WELL FOR THE 
FOUR DAYS 
I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE 
WITH MY GAME WITH EVERY MAJOR I 
PLAY THIS IS MY FOURTH TIME IN 
AUGUSTA I AM MORE AND MORE 
COMFORTABLE I AM REALLY ENJOYING 
IT THIS WEEK VERY RELAXED MOST OF 
THE GUYS ARE THE SAME L. PLAYED A 
PRACTICE ROUND YESTERDAY WITH 
JUSTIN AND IAN AND ANOTHER ONE 
TODAY WITH LUKE L. THINK WE ARE ALL 
VERY KEEN WE HAVE HAD A EUROPEAN 
WINNER NOW IN PADRAIG HARRINGTON 
NOT A BRITISH WINNER DONE WE NEED 
TO PUT THAT RIGHT 
SO A GOOD YOUNG ENGLISH TALENT 
WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO DO TO CROSS 
THAT HURDLE TO BECOME MAJOR 
WINNERS 
A NEED CONSISTENCY LOTS WINNERS OF REALLY GOOD LOOKING PLAYERS THIS 
YEAR BUT THEY DO NOT FOLLOW ON 
THEY DO NOT DO IT WEEK IN WEEK OUT 
EVEN ERNIE ELS WON FIFTEEN OR SIX WEEKS 
AGO AND DISAPPEARED VIJAY WILL BE 
COMING BACK HE IS GETTING A BIT 
OLDER OGILVY IS PLAYING 
BEAUTIFULLY LOTS OF PEOPLE CAN DO 
IT THIS IS SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YARDS A WORD 
ABOUT THE POOR OLD CADDIES L. SAW 
ONE STARTING OUT JUST NOW HE 
STRUGGLED TO MAKE THE TOP OF THE 
HILL ON THE FIRST ONE 
KEN OF THE 
BRITISH CHALLENGERS WHO IS YOUR 
FANCY 
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT JUSTIN FANCY ROSE PROBABLY IT IS HIS FOURTH 
TIME PLAYING HE LED ON FRIDAY 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY IN HIS FIRST 
FOUR APPEARANCES HE CAME VERY 
CLOSE LAST YEAR L. SUPPOSE JUSTIN 
ROSE IS PROBABLY THE HOME FAVOURITE 
HE IS THE HIGHEST RANKED EUROPEAN 
TOUR PLAYER IN THE FIELD 
LOTS OF 
THOSE PLAYERS WILL BE LOOKING TO 
GET A FEW POINTS IN THE RYDER CUP 
STANDINGS THE BIG STORY THIS WEEK 
WAS THAT THERE WERE A FEW 
DISPARAGING REMARKS ABOUT OUR 
CAPTAIN NICK FALDO WHAT DID YOU 
MAKE OF THAT 
A LITTLE SPAT THEY 
BOTH SEEM TO HAVE HAD A PROBLEM 
BUT IT IS A STORM IN A TEACUP L. 
THINK THE ADVANTAGE IS TO A SINNER 
WHO IS A BIG WEAKER 
YOU THINK HE 
IS WINDING HIM UP 
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY 
INTERVIEWED BY SOMEONE WHO SAID 
SOMETHING THAT WAS A BIT DEROGATORY 
TO NICK BUT NICK HAS LASTED ALL 
OUT HE HAS BEEN THROUGH THE MAIL 
THE LET'S HEAR FROM HIM 
HE'S GOT A 
QUICK INTRODUCTION AS I WOULD CALL 
IT TO THE BRITISH TABLOIDS HE WAS 
PROBABLY CAUGHT OFF GUARD WE ARE 
FINE WE GET ON WELL WE HAD A 
GREAT UP GREAT TIME TOGETHER WE 
HAVE BEEN CAPTAIN AS THE YEARS WE 
CAN JOKE ABOUT IT THERE IS 
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THERE THAT I 
AM BUT ABOUT AT ALL WE HAVE THE 
RIGHT INTENTIONS FOR THE RYDER CUP 
WE WANT TO HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE 
WITH EVERYBODY INVOLVED AND WE 
WILL PROBABLY END UP GOING FISHING 
AFTERWARDS THERE IS NO BEEF 
BETWEEN US RIGHT NOW HE HAS PLAYED 
IT DOWN BUT UNDERNEATH IT IN 
MIGHT LURK A LITTLE 
I THINK NICK 
FALDO HAS BEEN PRETTY SMART OVER 
THE YEARS HE DID WHAT HE NEEDED TO 
DO FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP AND NOW HE 
IS LEARNING THE MEDIA GAME ALL 
CREDIT TO HIM HE HAS DONE A SUPER 
JOB IT IS A DIFFICULT JOB RYDER 
CUP CAPTAIN BECAUSE WHENEVER YOU 
OPEN YOUR MOUTH YOU GET A JAB 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VERY 
EXPERIENCED PLAYERS WHO MAY HAVE 
PLAYED WELL EARLY ON THE MAKE UP 
OF THE TEAM WE HAVE NOT SEEN HOW 
THE TEAM WILL LOOK IN FIVE OR SIX 
MONTHS HE COULD HAVE A VERY 
EXPERIENCED TEAM 
THERE IS NO 
DOUBTING THAT TIGER WOODS IS THE 
FAVOURITE THIS WEEK BUT HAZEL 
BUMPED INTO SOME GUYS WITH OTHER 
IDEAS IDEAS QUESTION WHO WHOSE RECENT 
RECORD AT THE MASTERS IS BETTER 
TIGER WOODS OR PHIL MICKELSON IF 
YOU ARE THINKING LEFT THE YOU 
WOULD BE RIGHT THE WORLD NUMBER 
TWO HAS SLIPPED ON THE JACKET TWICE 
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS WOODS HAS 
MANAGED IT ONCE AND MICKELSON IS 
READY TO BE MEASURED UP AGAIN I I LOVE THIS TOURNAMENT L. LOVE COMING 
TO THE AUGUSTA NATIONAL I LOVE THE 
MASTERS TOURNAMENT AND I HAVE HAD 
SOME SUCCESS ON THESE GREENS THEY 
ARE THE MOST DEMANDING GREENS WE 
EVER FACE HAVING HAD SUCCESS IN 
THE PAST GIVES ME CONFIDENCE AND I 
AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS WEEK 
RETIEF GOOSEN'S GOT US YOU HE LOVES 
THIS PLACE AS WELL THE SOUTH 
AFRICAN IS A MASTER OF THE UNION IS

ANGEL CABRERA AND HIS SWASHBUCKLING 
ANDRES ROMERO AS WELL WHAT ABOUT 
FIJI'S CHAMPION VIJAY SINGH AND 
GEOFF OGILVY THE ONLY MAN TO HAVE 
BEATEN TIGER WOODS IN ANYTHING

ALWAYS IN THE HUNT HE HAS BEEN TOP 
TEN IN HIS LAST NINE STARTS HE 
LOVES THESE GREENS AND IS INSPIRED

HARRINGTON TRYING TO GET INTO THE 
CONVERSATION THAT IS AN EAGLE TWO 
STROKES BEHIND JOHNSON A SEVEN 
IRON TO THE PAR FOUR FOURTEENTH HE WILL BE LOOKING AT A BIRDIE

THE LEADER BOARDS WHICH WOULD TELL 
HIM THAT RIGHT NOW HE IS EVERYONE'S 
TARGET IF YOU REMEMBER TIGER 
WOODS'S SHOT FROM TWO YEARS AGO 
YOU WILL KNOW THAT SABBATINI HAS 
ALMOST THE IDENTICAL PLAY 
SABBATINI'S BALL DID NOT ROLL TO 
THE HOLE AND THE RESULT IS A BOGEY 
ZACH JOHNSON FOR A TWO STROKE LEAD 
HE HAS FOUR HOLES TO PLAY AND TIGER AFTER A PAR AT TWELVE WILL 
HAVE TO MAKE UP FOUR STROKES AND 
LEAPFROG SIX GOLFERS TO WIN HIS 
FIFTH GREEN JACKET HE STARTS BY

LUCK AT BIRDIE TIGER TIED FOR
