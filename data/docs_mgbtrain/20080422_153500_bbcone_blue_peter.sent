BADGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
SENDING IT IN WELL DESERVED L. 
THINK SHE DESERVES A YOU KNOW 
WHAT WHAT 
WHEN GETHIN CAME IN IT FELT WEIRD 
NOT MANY FAMOUS PEOPLE COME HERE 
NEXT UP IN OUR A Z. OF WEIRD ANIMALS 
IS THE RED EYED TREE FROG 
THESE COLOURFUL CHARACTERS LIVE IN 
THIS TROPICAL RAIN FORESTS OF 
CENTRAL AMERICA O. K. I'M KEEPING MY 
EYES PEELED BECAUSE APPARENTLY 
THERE IS A RED DYE TREE FROG IN 
HERE SOMEWHERE A CANNOT FIND IT 
WHERE IS IT 
THERE ARE THREE AND 
THE TRICK IS TO HAVE A LOOK UNDER 
THE LEAVES RATHER THAN LOOK ON TOP 
IT WON'T BE OBVIOUS 
IS THAT ONE AT 
THE BACK UNDERNEATH THAT LEAF 
THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT 
I WOULD 
NEVER HAVE SPOTTED THAT IT IS WELL 
CAMOUFLAGED IT IT IT LOOKS LIKE 
IN LEAF SLUG 
THAT IS A GOOD 
DESCRIPTION 
SHALL WE WAKE IT UP DESCRIPTION WAI KEE WAKING MR. FROG OH MY 
GOODNESS HE IS SCARY L. THOUGHT IT 
WAS DUE TO A MINUTE AGO NOT SO ANY 
MORE 
I CAN GET HIM TO STAND UP MORE LOOK HOW ORANGE HIS FEET WHY ARE 
HIS EYES SO READ 
READ BEING A 
WARNING COLOUR THEY SHOW THIS 
FLASH OF COLOUR THEY EAT INSECTS 
INVERTEBRATE THEY HAVE A STICKY 
TONGUE WHICH PULLS THEM INTO THEIR 
MOUTH THEY CANNOT SWALLOW PROPERLY 
SO THEY USE THEIR EYES AND PUSH THE 
FOOD ITEM DOWN INTO THEIR STOMACH 
BY USING THE SOCKETS OF THEIR EYES 
THAT IS WEIRD 
THEY LAID THEIR EGGS 
ON THE LEAF OVER WATER AND THEN 
THE EGGS WILL ACTUALLY HATCH ON 
THEIR WAY DOWN AND LAND IN THE 
WATER 
SO THIS LITTLE TADPOLE COMES WATER OUT YOU ARE A GORGEOUS LITTLE MAN 
THANKS FOR INTRODUCING ME TO HIM

WOULD WIN L. WILL PLACE IT JUST UP
