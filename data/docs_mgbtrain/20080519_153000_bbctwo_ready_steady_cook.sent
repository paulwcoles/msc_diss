PUY LENTILS BECAUSE I LOVE LENTILS I LOVE THESE THESE ARE ALREADY COOKED WHICH IS GREAT

AND THE WHOLE THING COMES T. O. SEVEN FIFTY FOUR 
A LITTLE BIT OVER SO THAT'S A GOOD OLD BISTRO BAG THERE LOVELY

I THINK WITH THE LAMB I'D LOVE TO DO SOME SORT OF SPICY KOFTAS 
AND THEN DO SOME REALLY LOVELY LENTILS TO GO WITH THAT 
THE GOATS' CHEESE WE OUGHT TO DO A GOATS' CHEESE TART AND WE CAN DO QUITE AN UNUSUAL LENTIL DRESSING 
WITH LOTS OF HERBS AND BALSAMIC DRIZZLE THAT OVER THE TOP AND THE REST WE'LL MAKE UP AS WE GO ALONG 
THESE WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO VERY MUCH TO THEY'RE SO BEAUTIFUL KEEP IT SIMPLE 
JUST A BIT OF A SCRUB AND A BIT OF A COOK COULDN'T HAVE PUT IT BETTER MYSELF

I THINK YOU DO I KNOW I DO DON'T TELL ANYBODY THOUGH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LESLIE AND KIM 
HOW YOU DOING MY MAN VERY GOOD GOOD TO SEE YOU ALEX ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
VERY GOOD GOOD ARE YOU A BIT OF A SCRUBBER 
DO YOU GET IN THE KITCHEN AND DO THE OLD CLEANING UP OF CARROTS 
I CAN'T MAKE TOAST YOU'RE JOKING 
I'M PATHETIC NO I VISIT THE KITCHEN TO EAT BUT I NEVER PREPARE ANY FOOD WHY'S THAT 
I THOUGHT YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE TODAY YOU SEE 
DID YOU SEE THE FINGER COME OUT THERE 
I'M SCARED NO IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL MANY YEARS AGO I STARTED WORKING IN A RESTAURANT 
AND MY AMBITION WAS EITHER TO BE A CHEF OR A GARDENER 
AND AFTER ABOUT TWO OR THREE MONTHS I DECIDED TO GO INTO THE GARDENING OH GO ON GET THAT BAG OUT MATE 
YOU WANTED TO BE A CHEF IT'S QUITE INTERESTING THAT ISN'T IT 
HE ONLY GAVE IT ABOUT TWO MONTHS THOUGH HE RECOVERED 
I LOVED EVERY MOMENT OF IT BUT GARDENING WAS THE THING THAT DREW ME 
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE IRISH AND NOT ITALIAN WELL THERE'S THE IRISH 
GOOD OLD TAZZA TELL US WHAT YOU'VE BROUGHT ALONG THERE 
SO PARMA HAM CHICKEN OF COURSE SPUDS 
MOZZARELLA CHEESE AND OLIVES SOME OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS TO EAT IT IS QUITE MEDITERRANEAN 
THIS COULDN'T BE A BETTER BAG YOU'RE MISSING A BIT OF SUNSHINE THOUGHT WE'D GET IT ON THE PLATE 
IT'S VERY GOOD HOW MUCH WAS ALL OF THIS THEN DIARMUID SEVEN POINT FOUR TWO VERY GOOD 
IT'S EXACTLY THE SORT OF FOOD I LIKE 
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE SO IT'S MY KIND OF STUFF I'LL DO A TART 
BUT NOT WITH A PASTRY BASE WITH A POTATO BASE IN A SALUTE TO YOUR IRISHNESS 
WITH COURGETTES AND TOMATOES ON TOP AND I'LL JUST DICE SOME MOZZARELLA AND PUT THAT OVER 
AND THEN I'M GOING TO DO A HERB AND OLIVE STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST WRAPPED IN THE PARMA HAM 
AND A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT YOU'LL MAKE UP AS YOU GO ALONG 
YOUR WIFE WON'T RECOGNISE YOU WHEN YOU GET HOME WONDERFULLY CREATIVE IN THE GARDEN 
EQUALLY CREATIVE IN THE KITCHEN AT THE END OF THIS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ALEX AND DIARMUID 
O. K. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NOW 
WE GIVE OUR CHEFS TWENTY MINUTES TO COME UP WITH THOSE WONDERFUL RECIPES 
WILL THEY ACHIEVE IT WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT WHEN I SAY READY STEADY COOK 
ALRIGHTY GET THAT APRON ON KIM 
NICE CHOPPING BOARD UP THERE FOR YOU 
LES WHAT'S HAPPENING I JUST WANT TO GET THIS PASTRY ON 
ACTUALLY KIM WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS WASH ME A FEW BITS OF THE KALE 
I WANT YOU TO OPEN THESE UP GIVE THEM A WASH AND JUST LIGHTLY TRIM THEM OFF FOR ME 
DO YOU GROW YOUR OWN VEGETABLES THEN KIM 
YEAH ALL SORTS OF SALAD LEAVES THINGS LIKE MITSUNA AND MUSTARD GREENS 
AND ALL KINDS OF LOVELY THINGS LIKE THAT IN POTS AS WELL 
YOU CAN GROW THEM IN POTS RIGHT OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN 
AND HOW DO THE CHILDREN REACT 
ARE THEY QUITE GOOD DO YOU LIKE TO GET OUT THERE AND HELP MUM DO ALL THIS 
THEY DO I THINK THE GARDEN'S A GREAT PLACE TO GET KIDS INVOLVED IN THE GARDENING 
GET THEIR HANDS WITH LITTLE SEEDS MAYBE SUNFLOWER SEEDS 
PUMPKINS ALL KINDS OF STUFF 
SPRING'S A GREAT TIME TO GET YOUR KIDS OUT GET THEM PLANTING 
OH GOD AND DID YOU USED TO DO THAT AS A CHILD A LITTLE BIT 
BUT I REALLY GOT INTO GARDENING AFTER I HAD THE CHILDREN AND I WANTED TO CREATE A GARDEN FOR THEM 
AND GET THEM INTERESTED IN GROWING THEY KNOW WHERE IT COMES FROM ABSOLUTELY 
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT YOUR BABIES ARE LIKE THAT AREN'T THEY LES IN THE GARDEN 
YES BUT I WAS TALKING TO KIM EARLIER AND SAYING I'M SO RUBBISH IN THE GARDEN 
I REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO GROW VEGETABLES AND STUFF A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE HELPS US BUT I AM RUBBISH 
WHEREAS MY SISTER JAQ SHE'S GOT REAL GREEN FINGERS SHE REALLY HAS 
BUT YOU CAN DEVELOP THAT AS KIM WAS SAYING 
YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE A GO DON'T BE SCARED TO MUCK UP YES EXACTLY 
DON'T WORRY I DO OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING IN LIFE IF IT DOESN'T GROW JUST TRY AGAIN 
HOW DO YOU WANT THOSE TRIMMED DOWN LES ARE YOU HAPPY 
BEAUTIFUL JUST AS YOU'RE DOING THAT THERE 
I'M NOT GOING TO DO MUCH WITH THOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL AINS O. K. AND WHAT ARE WE MAKING HERE 
QUITE A BIT OF FLOUR IN THERE BIT OF BUTTER 
BUTTER YEAH AND I'M JUST GOING TO DO A QUICK BIT OF THIS IS THE DULL BIT ACTUALLY 
PASTRY MADE IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT 
WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT A PULSE BUTTON GOOD IDEA TO USE IT WHEN YOU ADD THE WET INGREDIENTS 
BECAUSE IF YOU JUST LET IT GO ROUND AND ROUND 
IT GOES VERY TOUGH SO WE'VE GOT ABOUT EIGHT OUNCES OF FLOUR 
FOUR OUNCES OF BUTTER AND I'M JUST GOING TO ADD A COUPLE OF EGG YOLKS TO THAT 
THAT'S A GOOD LITTLE TIP THAT LESLIE'S JUST GIVEN YOU 
SO MANY OF US PUT ON THE OLD FOOD PROCESSOR IT GOES LIKE THAT 
YOU'RE THINKING IT GETS INTO A BALL AND YOU END UP WITH TOUGH TOUGH PASTRY 
BUT YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE PULSE BUTTON COMES IN VERY HANDY 
AND OBVIOUSLY WITH PASTRY 
THE LESS WATER YOU PUT IN AND THE LESS YOU WORK IT THE BETTER IT'S GOING TO BE SO PULSE 
O. K. AND WHAT'S THIS GOING WITH AND THIS IS GOING TO BE FOR THE GOATS' CHEESE TART O. K. 
THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED COME ON GUYS LET'S GO DOWN HERE 
SEE HOW ALEX IS GETTING ON 
HE'S WRAPPING THAT KIND OF MEDITERRANEAN CHICKEN BREAST 
WHAT HAVE YOU STUFFED IT WITH CHEF 
I'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD TIP TO START YOU OFF 
IF YOU'RE USING PARMA HAM LIKE THIS THAT'S BEEN SLICED 
PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE AND USE IT STRAIGHT OUT OF THE FRIDGE 
BECAUSE THIS SHOULD BE REALLY EASY TO WRAP UP 
AS SOON AS IT WARMS UP IT JUST GOES CRAZY DOESN'T IT 
IT STICKS TO THIS IT'S LIKE GLUE YEAH CARRY ON CHEF 
WHILE YOU'RE HERE YOU COULD HELP ME WITH IT COULDN'T YOU MATE 
I COULD DO A BIT OF A PEEL BACK ANOTHER THING THAT I WOULD SUGGEST WITH THIS 
IF YOU'RE COOKING AT HOME 
IS TO USE STREAKY BACON INSTEAD OF PARMA HAM 
OR A BIT OF PANCETTA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT CHEF 
WELL PANCETTA IS BASICALLY STREAKY BACON I KNOW YES 
JUST SOME SMOKED STREAKY BACON 
YOU GET GOOD STREAKY BACON IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
DO THEY GOOD BACON IN IRELAND 
VERY VERY GOOD YES THEY DO GOOD BACON IN IRELAND TOO BY THE BEST AUTHORITY 
SOMEONE WHO NEVER COOKS AND DOESN'T EVEN GROW HIS OWN VEG 
I KNOW BUT HE LOVES TO EAT I'M SURE 
I DO DO YOU EAT A LOT OF TRADITIONAL IRISH FOOD DIARMUID THIS WOULD BE TYPICAL OF THE FOOD I'D EAT 
BEING IRISH I DO LOVE THE POTATO 
THAT'S THE STAPLE 
BUT I'M DOING SOMETHING NEW WITH A POTATO THAT I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE YOU'RE TEACHING HIM SOME SKILLS 
SHALL I JUST GIVE YOU A GREAT TIP ABOUT THESE POTATO ROSTIS YEAH 
HE'S DOING THE BASE FOR THE POTATO ROSTI WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT AT HOME 
DON'T PARCOOK THE POTATOES AT ALL GRATE THEM PUT THEM IN A TEA TOWEL AND SQUEEZE THEM OUT 
GET ALL THAT LIQUID COMING OUT THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO COOK THEM THE WHOLE WAY IN THE PAN 
HALF IN THE PAN THE REST IN THE OVEN 
O. K. FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE IGNORANT 
AND DON'T KNOW WHAT A ROSTI IS EXPLAIN TO US AL IT'S A POTATO CAKE 
YES SO IT'S JUST GRATED POTATO 
FRESH POTATOES YOU DON'T NEED TO PARBOIL THEM YOU GRATE IT SQUEEZE OUT THE EXCESS WATER 
NOW SOME CHEFS DON'T SQUEEZE OUT THE EXCESS WATER WHY IS THAT 
I CAN'T THINK OF ANY REASON WHY YOU WOULDN'T BECAUSE THE THING IS 
IF YOU DON'T SHAKE OUT THAT EXCESS AINSLEY 
IT'S GOING TO STICK TO THE PAN COULD YOU BE SO KIND AS TO DO ME A BOWLFUL OF BASIL PICKED BASIL 
LOVELY HE'S KEEPING YOU BUSY THERE DID YOU WANT THAT CHOPPED UP CHEF NO JUST PICK THE BASIL 
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY TO DIARMUID IN THIS FIELD YOU HAVE TO COOK WHILE YOU TALK 
YOU HAVE TO MULTITASK YOUR WIFE WILL BE VERY IMPRESSED WHEN YOU GET HOME 
TEAR THAT UP DO YOU OFTEN TEAR IT OR DO YOU LIKE TO SHRED IT 
I SHRED IT NO NO JUST TAKE THE LEAVES OFF WHOLE PLEASE THERE'S AINSLEY INTERFERING AGAIN 
SHH DON'T TELL ANYONE THIS IS EXCITING VERY EXCITING IN THIS PAN HERE 
SO I'VE DONE ONE HALF OF THE POTATOES

OH DEAR 
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET INTO FOOD MODE TOO DIARMUID GET STUCK INTO IT ANYTHING YOU WANT 
LOOK AT THE COLOUR OF IT FIRST LOVELY WHERE SHOULD HE START THERE'S A PERFECT PLACE TO START 
I'M GOING TO START WITH THAT POTATO BECAUSE IT LOOKS SO INVITING THERE 
I LOVE THE IDEA THAT YOU STUFFED IT WITH THE MOZZARELLA AND EVERYTHING 
TALK TO US ABOUT THAT IT'S A POTATO ROSTI WHICH IS LIKE A POTATO CAKE 
BUT I'VE STUFFED IT WITH THE PARMA HAM AND THE MOZZARELLA 
AND THEN I PUT THE RAW COURGETTE AND TOMATO SALAD ROUND THE OUTSIDE 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS LIKE A MEAL IN ITSELF 
THE CRISPINESS ON THE OUTSIDE SO SOFT AND GOOEY INSIDE REALLY GORGEOUS O. K. GO ON 
SORRY DIARMUID'S TASTING THE CHICKEN THAT'S GOT OLIVES INSIDE AND PARMA HAM ROUND THE OUTSIDE 
I DIDN'T SEASON THE CHICKEN BECAUSE THERE'S ENOUGH SALT 
AND THEN I MADE QUITE A LOT OF TOMATO COULIS TO CONTRAST THAT SALT AGAIN SO IT LOOKS SO FRESH 
THOSE COLOURS AGAIN SO VIBRANT EXACTLY THEY REALLY DO STICK OUT 
IT'S ALSO CHICKEN BREAST I MUCH PREFER TO EAT CHICKEN LEGS BECAUSE THEY'VE MORE FLAVOUR 
BREASTS NEED A BIT OF PERKING UP SO THAT'S PERFECT O. K. BUT YOU COULD DO THAT WITH PORK IF YOU WANTED TO 
VERY LIGHT REALLY LIGHT NOT A HEAVY MEAL AT ALL 
AND I'M NOT A GREAT MEAT EATER BUT CHICKEN DONE LIKE THAT IS GORGEOUS LOVELY THAT REALLY WORKS FOR YOU

WE ALSO HAVE A QUICKIE QUESTION FROM ONE OF OUR AUDIENCE MEMBERS 
TODAY IT COMES FROM EXCUSE ME ROSEMARY LANGLEY 
SO LET'S FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT ROSEMARY WOULD LIKE TO ASK OUR CHEFS LISTEN UP GUYS 
YES WHEN MAKING ONION RINGS SHOULD YOU SOAK THEM IN MILK FIRST 
O. K. THAT'S A GOOD LITTLE POINT THERE ACTUALLY 
IT IS A LOT OF PEOPLE SOAK THEM IN MILK FIRST BECAUSE IT TAKES AWAY THE HARSHNESS OF THE ONION 
AND IT JUST HELPS TO SORT OF SOFTEN THEM UP A LITTLE BIT 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA I'VE DONE THEM NOT SOAKED AND SOAKED AND I THINK THEY'RE ALWAYS BETTER SOAKED 
SOAK THEM IN MILK THEN TOSS THEM IN A LITTLE BIT OF SEASONED FLOUR ABSOLUTELY 
O. K. AND ALEX ALWAYS BUSTING WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY ALEX 
WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS USE RED ONIONS CUT THEM QUITE THICKLY 
AND INSTEAD OF SOAKING THEM SPRINKLE THEM WITH SALT AND SUGAR 
LEAVE THEM FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THAT MAKES THE FLAVOUR MUCH MORE GENTLE 
A COUPLE OF NICE IDEAS FOR YOU YES THANK YOU THANKS 
O. K. ABOUT THREE AND A HALF MINUTES TO GO NOW GUYS OH BLIMEY
