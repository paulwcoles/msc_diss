WAS INTERRUPTED TODAY BY A SERIES 
OF PROTESTS WITH OVER THIRTY ANTI 
CHINA DEMONSTRATORS ARRESTED 
DESPITE THE TORCH BEARERS BEING 
SURROUNDED BY RINGS OF SECURITY 
THERE WERE REPEATED SCUFFLES 
BETWEEN POLICE AND THOSE DEMANDING 
A BOYCOTT OF THE BEIJING GAMES THE 
THIRTY ONE MILE ROUTE THROUGH A FUTURE 
OLYMPIC GAMES WAS SURROUNDED BY 
PROTESTORS PROTESTORS A SUBDUED CEREMONY IN AN EMPTY 
STADIUM THIS WAS NOT THE 
CELEBRATION CHINA HAD WANTED AS 
SIR STEVEN REDGRAVE CARRIED THE 
TORCH OUT THE TROUBLE STARTED 
DEMONSTRATORS TRIED TO BOARD THE 
WAITING BUS AND WERE WRESTLED AWAY 
BY POLICE

INTO TIBET PLEASE GORDON BROWN I 
URGE YOU STOP THE TORCH GOING INTO 
TIBET TIBET THE DISRUPTIONS BEGAN WITHIN THREE 
MINUTES AND KEPT ON COMING ONE 
DEMONSTRATOR USED A FIRE 
EXTINGUISHER ANOTHER TRIED TO 
SNATCH THE TORCH 
AS I SPEAK 
SOMEONE HAS TRIED TO GRAB THE TORCH 
FROM KONNIE HUQ THE BLUE PETER 
PRESENTER A MAN HAS TRIED TO GRAB 
THE TORCH HAULED TO THE GROUND BY 
POLICE OFFICERS HE HAD HIS HANDS 
ON THE TORCH 
WITH TWO RINGS OF PROTECTION 
CHINESE OFFICIALS INSIDE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE OUTSIDE THE 
TORCH BATTLED THROUGH BUT THERE 
WERE HUNDREDS OF DEMONSTRATORS 
WAITING ON THE ROUTE AHEAD 
WE CAN 
ARGUE ABOUT A SPORTING AND 
POLITICAL ISSUE THIS IS A MORAL 
ISSUE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TORTURE 
AND LACK 
OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS THAT 
IS 
MORE IMPORTANT THAN POLITICS AND 
SPORT SPORT THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR TOOK THE 
TORCH THROUGH CHINATOWN IT WASN'T 
WHAT WAS PLANNED BUT THEN THE DAY 
WASN'T GOING THE WAY IT WAS 
INTENDED IT WAS A TOWER OF 
LONDON'S LANDMARKS IN TRAFALGAR 
SQUARE THE TORCH TOOK THE PLINTH 
THE PROTESTORS THE FOUNTAINS IT 
WAS THE DEMONSTRATORS MESSAGE NOT 
CHINA'S BEING BEAMED TO THE WORLD 
ALONG WHITEHALL ANTI CHINESE 
PROPERTYORS AND CHINESE CAME FACE 
TO FACE 
WE 
ARE FROM CHINA AND WE TO FACE ARE PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY HOSTING 
THE OLYMPICS THIS YEAR 
IT IS OUR 
RIGHT 
TO BE 
PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY 
THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS TO STOP US TO 
WAVE OUR OWN FLAG 
AS THE TORCH APPROACHED DOWNING 
STREET THERE WERE REPEATED 
SCUFFLES BETWEEN POLICE AND 
DEMONSTRATORS 
INVISIBLE AS HUNDREDS JEERED ITS 
PASSAGE THE POINT OF PARADING IT 
IN PUBLIC WAS LOST 
INSIDE THE SECURITY CORDON OF 
DOWNING STREET GORDON BROWN 
WATCHED AS THE FLAME WAS HANDED ON 
BUT ALTHOUGH HE SHOOK HANDS WITH 
EVERYONE HE DIDN'T TOUCH THE TORCH 
ITSELF THE GOVERNMENT'S 
PARTICIPATION WAS CAREFULLY 
CALIBRATED 
THE WELCOME OF THE CALIBRATED OLYMPIC TORCH TO LONDON IS NOT THE 
SAME AS CONDONING THE HUMAN RIGHTS 
REGIME IN CHINA OR CONDONING THE 
TREATMENT OF TIBET 
PAULA RADCLIFFE THE MARATHON 
RUNNER LED THE WAY TO THE EAST OF 
LONDON WHERE THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE GAMES WILL 
BE HELD BY NOW THE PROTECTION FOR 
THE TORCH WAS STEPPED UP MANY OF 
THE TORCH BEARERS SYMPATHISEED WITH 
THE PROTESTORS SIR STEVEN REDGRAVE 
BELIEVED IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING 
CHINA COULD LOOK AT 
IT IS THE 
POINT OF LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY 
THAT PROTESTORS CAN MAKE THEIR 
POINT AS AN ATHLETE I'M PLEASED 
THAT IS HAPPENING 
ELLEN MACARTHUR 
CARRIED THE TORCH DOWN RIVER TO THE 
OH TWO DOME WHERE MANY PROMINENT 
SUPPORTERS OF THE OLYMPICS WERE 
WAITING AMONG THEM PRINCESS ANNE 
AND TONY LIVESEY FOR MANY OF THOSE 
INVOLVED KEN LIVINGSTON FOR MANY 
THE DILEMMA TODAY COULD BE ANSWERED 
WHO WOULD BENEFIT MOST FROM THE 
PROTESTS SURROUNDING THE EVENT THE 
CHINESE GOVERNMENT OR THOSE WHO 
OPPOSE IT 
THOSE IMAGES OF THE TORCH AND THE 
PICTURES SEEN AROUND THE WORLD IN 
CHINA THE COVERAGE WAS STRICTLY 
CONTROLLED CONTROLLED EVERY NIGHT FROM ON HIGH THE 
COMMUNIST PARTY DELIVERS THE NEWS 
TONIGHT'S MOST IMPORTANT STORY IS 
THE STATE OF THE MODERN TRACTOR AND 
THE PROING OF SOCIALISM IN THE 
COUNTRYSIDE THE PROGRESS OF 
SOCIALISM IN THE 
COUNTRYSIDE A 
MINUTES LATER 
THERE 
IS BRIEF 
MENTION 
OF THE 
TORCH RELAY 
IN 
LONDON AND HOW WELL IT IS GOING 
YOU 
WON'T GET 
TO SEE ANY PICTURES 
OF THE DISRUPTION TO THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH RELAY IF YOU WATCH THIS 
CHANNEL THE CHINESE COMMUNIST 
PARTY HAS A SIMPLE RULE IT WON'T 
SHOW ANY PICTURES WHICH RUIN THIS 
COUNTRY'S IDEA OF A TROUBLE FREE 
GAMES 
SO WE ASK DOES ANYONE HERE GAMES KNOW ABOUT THE SCUFFLES IN LONDON 
THIS MAN SAYS HE HASN'T HEARD 
ANYTHING HIS WIFE ADDS SHE READ 
EVERYONE SUPPORTS THE OLYMPICS AND 
IT SHOULDN'T GET MIXED UP WITH 
ANYTHING ELSE THIS MAN HASN'T 
HEARD ANYTHING IS IT SOMETHING TO 
DO WITH THE DALLI SPORT AND 
POLITICS SHOULD BE KEPT SEPARATE 
CHINA INSISTS ON KEEPING BAD NEWS 
AWAY FROM ITS CITIZENS 
OUR SPORTS EDITOR IS WITH ME IN THE 
STUDIO IT IS A POWERFUL SYMBOL THE 
OLYMPIC FLAME THINGS QUITE GO AS 
PLANNED TODAY DO YOU THINK THE 
VERY IMAGE OF THE OLYMPICS HAS BEEN 
TARNISHED 
I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO TARNISHED GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND IN 
RETROSPECT THAT THE TORCH ROUTE 
VERY LONG THIRTY ONE MILES WAS FAR TOO 
LONG THE RESULT WAS BECAUSE OF 
THE PROTEST THERE WERE RECURRING 
IMAGES RIGHT THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
THERE IS ALSO SATISFACTION THAT THE 
PROTEST TOOK PLACE AND IT PROVES 
WE ARE A TOLERANT DEMOCRACY WHICH 
OTHER COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY CHINA 
IS NOT WHATEVER THE GLOSS THAT IS 
PUT ON IT THE FACT REMAINS THAT 
THIS IS NOT ENHANCED IN FACT 
DAMAGED THE OLYMPIC BRAND IF YOU 
THINK OF THE ABIDING IMAGE A TORCH 
RELAY IS MEANT TO PRODUCE IT IS OF 
A TORCH BEARER BRINGING IT THROUGH 
THE STREETS AND CONNECTSING WITH 
PEOPLE WE HAVE HAD A CAGED 
PROSESSION WITH SECURITY BY THE 
POLICE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE 
TO SEE 
THE FACE OF THE TORCH BEARER AND 
THAT 
MOMENT WHERE 
THE FLAME GOES 
FROM 
ONE TORCH 
BEARER TO THE OTHER 
HAS OFTEN NOT BEEN SEEN THIS HAS 
DONE NOTHING TO ENHANCE EITHER 
BEIJING'S GAMES OR LONDON GAMES IF 
ANYTHING IT HAS PROBABLY DAMAGED 
IT IT THERE HAVE BEEN MORE SERIOUS 
PROBLEMS AT HEATHROW AIRPORT THIS 
TIME BECAUSE OF HEAVY SNOW GATWICK 
HAS ALSO BEEN AFFECTED AT HEATHROW 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE FLIGHTS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED 
HOW SERIOUS IS THIS LOOKING 
TONIGHT 
IT'S BEEN A MISERABLE DAY TONIGHT FOR PASSENGERS LET ME GIVE YOU 
THOSE FIGURES AGAIN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE 
CANCELLATIONS AT HEATHROW AIRPORT 
THE MAJORITY BRITISH AIRWAYS PLANES 
AT GATTIC FIFTY ONE PLANES HAVEN'T LEFT 
AT GATWICK FIFTY ONE PLANES HAVEN'T LEFT 
THE GROUND B. A. A. SAY IT IS BECAUSE 
OF HEAVY SNOW THEY HAVE REMOVED IT 
FROM THE RUNWAYS BUT THEY ARE 
HAVING TROUBLE DE ICING THE PLANES 
THEY HAVE RUN OUT OF DE ICER SOME 
OF THE PASSENGERS INSIDE HAVE BEEN 
WAITING FOR UP TO TWELVE HOURS THEY 
ARE VERY FRUSTRATED THERE ARE 
REPORTS OF SCUFFLES INSIDE THE 
AIRPORT THIS COMES ON TOP OF THE 
PROBLEMS AT TERMINAL FIVE WITH THE 
BAGGAGE THOUSANDS OF BAGS WAITING 
TO BE REUNITED WITH OWNERS PLANES 
ARE TAKING OFF BUT THE ADVICE FOR 
TOMORROW IS CHECK WITH YOUR AIRLINE 
BEFORE TRAVELLING OUT THERE COULD 
BE KNOCK ON EFFECTS 
GEORGE BUSH AND VLADIMIR PUTIN HAVE 
METAPHOR THE LAST TIME AS 
PRESIDENTS THEIR SUMMIT ON THE 
BLACK SEA INCLUDED AN UPBEAT 
ASSESSMENT OF THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS 
BUT ON THE KEY ISSUE OF U. S. MISSILE 
DEFENCE AND NATO ENLARGEMENT THEY 
REMAIN DEEPLY DIVIDED THIS IS THE 
PICTURE GEORGE BUSH AND VLADIMIR 
PUTIN WOULD LIKE THE WORLD TO 
REMEMBER OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP TWO 
OLD FRIENDS WALKING ON THE SEASHORE 
IN THE TWILIGHT OF THEIR 
PESIDENCIES TODAY AS THEY 
METAPHOR THE LAST TIME GEORGE BUSH 
SOUGHT TO CLAIM THAT HIS FRIENDSHIP 
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS SUCCEEDED 
IN BURYING THE COLD WAR FOREVER 
THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN THIS 
RELATIONSHIP IS COULD WE WORK 
TOGETHER TO PUT THE COLD WAR IN THE 
PAST I FULLY RECOGNISE THERE ARE 
PEOPLE IN AMERICA 
AND RUSSIA 
THAT 
THINK 
THE COLD 
WAR STILL EXISTS 
BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR 
LEADERS TO THINK STRAGICALLY NOT 
GET STUCK IN THE PAST 
BUT THAT'S 
NOT HOW RUSSIA SEES THINGS THIS IS 
THE SIZE OF NATO IN NINETEEN NINETY AND THIS 
IS HOW IT ISTH HAS GROWN SINCE NOW 
GEORGIA AND UKRAINE ARE LINING UP 
TO JOIN ADD IN U. S. PLANS FOR A NEW 
ANTI MISSILE SYSTEM IN THE CZECH 
REPUBLIC AND POLAND AND TO RUSSIA 
IT LOOKS LIKE ENCIRCLEMENT 
I WILL NOT CONCEAL THAT ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT 
ISSUES WAS AND REMAINS THE ISSUE OF 
MISSILE DEFENCE IN EUROPE THIS IS 
NOT ABOUT LANGUAGE THIS IS NOT 
ABOUT DIPLOMATIC PHRASING OR 
WORDING 
THIS IS 
ABOUT 
SUBSTANCE 
OF THE 
ISSUE L. WOULD 
LIKE TO BE VERY CLEAR ON THIS OUR 
FUNDAMENTAL ATTITUDE 
TO THE 
FUNDAMENTAL ATTITUDE TO THE AMERICAN PLANS HAS NOT CHANGED 
ACROSS THE BORDER IN UKRAINE AND 
GEORGIA IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT 
HERE NATO MEMBERSHIP IS SEEN AS 
INSURANCE AGAINST A NEWLY 
RESURGENT RUSSIA WHICH STILL HAS 
THOUSANDS OF NUCLEAR WARHEADS 
TANKS AND DOZENS OF STRATEGIC 
BOMBERS THE COLD WAR MAY BE OVER 
BUT THE DEEP DISTRUST THAT ONCE CUT 
EUROPE IN TWO STILL PERSISTS 
RUSSIA'S MILITARY ELITE SEE THE 
STRATEGIC EUROPEAN MAP REDRAWN IN 
FAVOUR OF AMERICA DESPITE THE 
PROTESTATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP BY 
PRESIDENT BUSH THEY DON'T BELIEVE 
THAT AMERICA'S PLANS ARE NOT 
DIRECTED AT RUSSIA 
THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH HAS BEEN 
DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL AFTER 
THREE DAYS OF TREATMENT FOR CHEST 
INFECTION PRINCE PHILIP EIGHTY SIX WILL 
RECUPERATE AT WINDSOR CASTLE HIS 
ENGAGMENTS FOR TOMORROW HAVE BEEN 
CANCELLED AND WILL BE DECIDED ON A 
DAY TO DAY BASIS
