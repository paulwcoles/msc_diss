GOOD AFTERNOON ON THE OPENING 
WEEKEND OF THE EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD 
SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIP WE ARE 
SETTLING IN FOR THE LONG HAUL THIS 
IS A MARATHON TOURNAMENT AT SEVENTEEN 
DAYS IT IS THE SECOND LONGEST 
ANNUAL SPORTING EVENT IN THE WORLD 
SO FROM THE PLAYERS' POINT OF VIEW 
BEING ABLE TO RELAX AND ENJOY THE 
CLAUSTROPHOBIC ATMOSPHERE IN THE 
CRUCIBLE IS ALL PART OF WHAT IT 
TAKES TO WIN WE GET RESPITE HERE 
THIS IS WHETHER FANS CAN COME AND 
CHEWED THE FAT AND CHAT ABOUT WHAT 
THEY HAVE JUST SEEN IN THE 
AUDITORIUM AND AFTER YESTERDAY'S 
DISPLAY BY THE DEFENDING CHAMPION 
THERE HAS BEEN MUCH TO TALK ABOUT 
THE EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD CHAMPION FROM 
SCOTLAND JOHN HIGGINS 
MATTHEW STEVENS MAKES FOURTEEN REDS FOURTEEN 
BLACKS ONE HUNDRED TWELVE AND LEADS 
JOHN HIGGINS LEADS MATTHEW STEVENS 
BY SEVEN FRAMES TO TWO HE NEEDS 
ANY THREE OF THE TEN FRAMES THIS 
EVENING TO GO THROUGH TO THE LAST 
SIXTEEN ONLY THREE 
THE COMEBACK CONTINUES MATTHEW 
STEVENS HAS GOT THREE FRAMES THIS 
SEASON THIS EVENING HE HAS 
STOPPED THE ROCK BY THE LOOKS OF 
THINGS 
WHAT A PERFORMANCE FROM JOHN 
HIGGINS HAD A VERY VERY 
ENTERTAINING MATCH BUT IT IS THE 
SCOTS MAN WHO DONE IN STYLE A 
COMFORTABLE WINNER IN THE END TEN TO FIVE 
I WAS FULLY FOCUSED COMING DOWN AND 
I KNEW I HAD A TOUGH ONE AND MAYBE 
THAT FOCUSES YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE 
I PLAYED WELL I MISSED A COUPLE 
BUT APART FROM THAT I PLAYED WELL 
I 
WOULD LOVE TO WIN IT AGAIN L. WOULD LOVE TO GO TO THREE TIMES 
ALONGSIDE JOHN SPENCER HE 
SOMETIMES GETS FORGOTTEN ABOUT 
BECAUSE YOU MENTION THE OTHER 
GREATS BUT HE WAS GREAT IN HIS OWN 
RIGHT AND TO BE ALONGSIDE HIM IT 
WOULD BE A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT 
I CAN DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING 
HIGGINS SAID WHEN THE DRAW CAME 
OUT I THOUGHT IT WAS A STINKER FOR 
BOTH BUT JOHN WILL BE DELIGHTED TO 
GET THROUGH THAT 
YES HE PLAYED 
SUPERB SNOOKER WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR 
A WINNER DUE COME UP WITH NAMES 
LIKE SHAUN MURPHY STEVE MAGUIRE 
SELBY AND JOHN HIGGINS WAS LEFT 
OUT OF THE EQUATION QUITE WRONGLY 
ON THAT PERFORMANCE 
IT IS HORRIBLE 
TO USE A FIRST ROUND MATCH BUT 
PARTICULARLY AT THE CRUCIBLE TO 
LOSE NOW HE IS OVER THAT HE CAN 
WATCH THE OTHER PLAYERS SWEAT AND 
HAVE DAYS OFF AND COME BACK FOR 
ROUND TWO 
WHO IS TO SAVE HE CAN'T 
LIFT THAT TITLE FOR THE THIRD TIME 
OF THE PERFORMANCES LIKE THAT WHO 
IS TO SAY 
JOHN HIGGINS PLANS TO RELAX AND 
WATCH FOOTBALL BEFORE HIS NEXT 
MATCH ON THURSDAY BUT I AM SURE HE 
WILL KEEP HALF AN EYE ON THE OTHER 
MEN LEFT IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP AND 
THESE ARE THE PLAYERS WE WILL BE 
WATCHING TODAY 
AUSTRALIA'S NEIL ROBERTSON IS WELL 
IN FRONT AGAINST NIGEL BOND DOES 
HE EXPECT NIGEL TO TOP NO MR. BOND 
HE EXPECTS YOU TO LOOSE 
DADDY'S GIRL IS WAITING FOR NEWS 
FOR RYAN DAY'S MATCH AGAINST 
DUBLIN'S JUDGE 
I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO 
COMMENTATING ON STEPHEN HENDRY AND 
MARK ALAN MARK ALAN THE BEST 
YOUNG PLAYER TO COME FROM NORTHERN 
IRELAND FOR MANY YEARS AND MAYBE 
THE CHANCE TO BECOME A WORLD 
CHAMPION STEPHEN HENDRY I THINK 
STILL HAS AN EIGHTH ALL TITLE IN 
HIM SO IT WILL BE FASCINATING TO 
SEE HOW IT PANS OUT WORLD TITLE 
WE HAVE ANOTHER MAJOR ARTISTIC 
UNDERTAKING AS LOCAL ARTIST TOM 
WALKER LOADS UP HIS BRUSHES HAVE 
NO PAINT DRYING QUIT SUPPLIES 
MEANWHILE ALI CARTER'S CAMPAIGN 
TOOK OFF LAST NIGHT CAN HE LAND 
THE SECOND ROUND SPOTTED DAY 
AND FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US WITH 
YOUR THOUGHTS 
OR PUT YOUR QUESTIONS TO THE 
EXPERTS PLEASE GET IN TOUCH 
BUT NO MORE QUESTIONS TO JOHN 
PARROTT ABOUT HE HAD HE CONTRIVED 
TO LOSE AGAINST JOHN PERRY WHEN 
LEADING EIGHT TO FOUR MORE THAN ENOUGH GRIEF 
ON THAT ALREADY WE HAVE UNFINISHED 
BUSINESS CONCERNING THE MATCH 
BETWEEN NEIL ROBERTSON WHO MADE A 
VERY SHARP START AGAINST NIGEL BOND 
YESTERDAY FORESEE A REMINDER OF 
HOW THEIR FIRST SESSION WENT 
HERE IS A REMINDER 
THEY CUED UP YESTERDAY MORNING IN 
THE FIRST ROUND MATCH AND IT WAS 
THE MELBOURNE MACHINE WHO HIT THE 
GROUND RUNNING 
BREAKS OF FIFTY NINE SEVENTY AND FIFTY TWO SECURED THE 
FIRST THREE FRAMES FOR THE AUSSIE 
NIGEL BOND MANAGED TO GET ON THE 
SCOREBOARD BY TAKING A SCRAPPY 
FOURTH FRAME 
BUT ROBINSON CAME STORMING BACK 
AFTER THE INTERVAL NEIL ROBERTSON 
A BIT OF LUCK AND A BREAK OF EIGHTY IN 
THE SIXTH FRAME GAVE NEIL EIGHTY FIVE TO ONE LEAD 
A FIVE TO ONE LEAD BOND TOOK FRAME SEVEN 
WITH A CLASSIC CLEARANCE OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
BUT THERE WAS NO STOPPING BUT 
ROBERT SOME RUNAWAY TRAIN THEY 
NEIL ROBERTSON A RUNAWAY TRAIN AND 
THE MAN FROM MELBOURNE TO THE FINAL 
FRAME OF THE SESSION FOR AN 
IMPOSING SEVEN TO TWO ADVANTAGE HEADING INTO 
TODAY'S SESSIONS THEY WERE BACK AT 
TEN A M. THIS MORNING TO FINISH THE 
MATCH 
HE WE ARE IN THE TWELFTH FRAME NEIL 
ROBERTSON IS LEADING BY EIGHTEEN POINTS 
HE WE ARE 
HIS PRIORITY WAS GETTING THE BROWN 
SAFE THERE THAT WAS GOOD HE HAS 
LEFT NIGEL WITH A STRANGE SHOT NO 
OBVIOUS SAFETY HE COULD GET THE 
BROWN ON THE BAULK CUSHION WHICH 
IS FAIRLY NEGATIVE BUT SOMETIMES 
THAT IS ALL YOU CAN DO 
THAT WAS NOT A NICE SHOT TO PLAY ONE 
THINK NIGEL PLAY THE ONLY SHOT THAT 
WE IN THE COMMENTARY BOX FELT HE 
COULD ANY OTHER SAFETY SHOT WAS 
AWKWARD IT HAS GIVEN NEIL 
ROBERTSON A SHOT NOW TO WIN THE 
FRAME AFTER ALL THE HOT WHAT NIGEL 
HAS PUT IN THIS WILL BE A 
SICKENING SHOULD HE POT THIS 
THIS WILL BE SICKENING 
HE HAS HAD A RESULT THERE NEIL HE 
OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T PLAY THE SNOOKER 
AND HE HAS BEEN VERY FORTUNATE TO 
COVER THAT HE HAS BEEN A LITTLE 
BIT ANXIOUS THIS FRAME HE IS 
TRYING TO BE TOO CAREFUL 
WE ALWAYS SAY IT IS NOT ABOUT 
HITTING IT IT IS GETTING IT SAFE 
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS KIND OF SHOT 
YOU CAN NEVER GUARANTEE A GOOD 
WHITE 
IT IS NIGEL'S TURN TO HAVE A GOOD 
KISS THAT IS NOT BAD 
IT WOULDN'T 
SURPRISE ME IF NEIL HAD A GO AT 
THIS IT IS NOT RISE HE CAN PLAY 
THE SAFETY SHOT IF HE WANTS IT IS 
NOT A NICE HE COULD HIT THIS 
FOLLOWING THE PHRASE FOUR IN THE 
FACE HE IS QUITE ADVENTUROUS 
IF NIGEL DOES GO ONE TO WIN THIS 
MATCH WHICH IS VERY HARD TO CALL 
AT THE SCORE LINE IT WILL ALL BE 
ABOUT THIS FRAME 
THAT'S NOT THE BEST HE NEEDED TO 
BE A BIT CLOSER TO THE BLUE THAN 
THIS BUT ONE GOOD POT SHOULD WIN 
THE FRAME IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S 
TO PINCH 
THE FRAME AND SOME FRAME IT IS TO 
PINCH QUITE EXTRAORDINARY 
HE'S FEELING THE TENSION I THINK 
NEIL CAN'T QUITE BELIEVE WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED IN THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES OF 
THIS FRAME 
WELL DONE NIGHT JOB WHAT A STEAL 
THAT WAS HE WAS WAY BEHIND A 
NIGHT JOB HE HAS BROUGHT ANOTHER 
ONE BACK 
DE BELOW ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN IT IS STILL GOING 
STRONG ZERO ZERO ONE FOUR SEVEN 
IT WAS DOWN TO BE EXCELLENT BREAK 
OFF SHOT FROM NEIL ROBERTSON THAT 
HAS GIVEN HIM HALF A CHANCE DOWN 
TO THE EXCELLENT L. THINK THE THIN 
CUT IS EASIER THAN THE LONG POT 
SOMETIMES YOU MAKE YOUR OWN LUCK 
HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE THE CUE BALL 
WAS PLAYING HE WAS JUST HOPING TO 
KEEP IN PLAY THE YELLOW DOES POT 
HE HAS HAD A BIT OF A RESULT THERE 
HE PROBABLY DESERVED IT 
A HUGE AMOUNT OF CUE POWER ON THAT 
SHOT SOMEHOW THEY DID NOT MANAGE 
TO BREAK UP THAT WELL A LOT OF CUE 
POWER NEEDED FOR THIS SHOT REELING 
INTO THE RED 
I SUPPOSE HE WAS A LITTLE LUCK 
UNLUCKY NOT TO HIT INTO THE PACK 
THE SECOND TIME IT SEEMED TO HIT A 
WALL ON A SECOND SPINNER IF IT IS 
STRAIGHT YOU WOULD THINK THIS IS 
CERTAINTY WHEN THEY ARE OFF 
STRAIGHT THEY ARE HORRIBLE 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM PLAY A SHOT 
RIGHT HANDED IN HIS CAREER THAT IS 
PROBABLY HAS FIRST RIGHT HANDER 
SHOT IN PROFESSIONAL SNOOKER 
THAT'S TERRIFIC 
HE DOES NOT LOOK A NATURAL RIGHT 
HAND OF THOUGH I MUST SAY BUT YOU 
CANNOT ARGUE WITH THAT SHOT 
AND LEFT HANDED A MASSIVE AMOUNT 
OF POWER BY THE WAY THIS MAN 
I THINK HIS TEMPERAMENT IS ONE OF 
HIS GREATEST ASSETS HIS 
TEMPERAMENT IS VERY VERY GOOD IT 
IS ONE OF THE REASONS HE HAS WON A 
COUPLE OF TOURNAMENTS IF HE COULD 
GET HIS ALL ROUND GAME A LITTLE BIT 
SHARPER HE WOULD BE A TOUGH NUT TO 
CRACK 
I AGREE ABOUT HIS TEMPERAMENT HE 
IS THE TYPE OF PLAYER WHO YOU WOULD 
BACK IN THE LAST FRAME SITUATION L. THINK HE ENJOYS THE PRESSURE 
WELL HE WENT INTO THEM TRIED TO 
LAND ON THE ONE ON THE LEFT AT HIS 
END OF BREAK AGAIN ABOUT FIFTY POINTS 
AHEAD HE WILL BE AWARE OF WHAT 
HAPPENED IN THE LAST FRAME 
ONCE AGAIN INDIA WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE ONLY SCORED FIFTY SEVEN 
NEIL WILL BE DISAPPOINTED 
I THINK HE PROBABLY PLAYED FOR THE 
BLACK THERE TO MAKE IT INTO A SHOT 
THE FACTS HE HIT IT THICK TOOK THE 
PACE AT OF THE CUE BALL AND THAT IS 
WHY HE IS AIMING AT THE RED IN THE 
MIDDLE THIS LOOKS TO BE 
STRAIGHTFORWARD ANOTHER THREE REDS 
AND COLOURS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO BE 
ONE AWAY FROM VICTORY 
SO SIXTY SEVEN POINTS THE DIFFERENCE 
EXACTLY THAT ON THE TABLE BUT IT 
WOULD BE VERY UNLIKELY THAT NIGEL 
SHOULD COME BACK TO THE TABLE THAT 
WAS A KICK IT MEANS HE MIGHT 
ACTUALLY GET A CHANCE TO COME BACK 
BUT HE WILL NEED SNOOKERS IF HE 
DOES THAT IS PROBABLY THE ONLY WAY 
STILL A GOOD LEAD 
THE BLACK HAS NOT REACHED BUT 
BARRING SNOOKERS IT WILL BE NEIL 
ROBERTSON WHO GOES NINE TO FOUR IN FRONT 
ROBERTSON WHO GOES NINE TO FOUR IN FRONT HE DID INDEED EYEING UP FOR THE 
PLACE IN THE LAST SIXTEEN FOR THE NEXT 
TIME IN HIS CAREER AND WHAT ABOUT 
THE NEXT FRAME 
NIGEL BREAKING OFF HE NEEDS TO WIN 
ALL OF THE LAST GAMES IF HE IS 
GOING TO WIN 
FABULOUS RED REALLY GOOD READ 
BECAUSE HE PRESUMABLY REALISED HE 
WOULD BE KISSING INTO THE OTHER 
BALLS HE PLAYED IT VERY 
CONFIDENTLY MAYBE HE THOUGHT IT 
WOULD HAVE ON A ROUND THE BACK OF 
THE BLACK BUT EVERY CREDIT FOR 
TAKING THE BALL ON AND YOU DESERVE 
A BIT OF LUCK SOMETIMES 
HE HAS A SHOT ON THE ROAD IT WOULD 
BE IN THE RIGHT CENTRE L. DON'T 
THINK HE WILL GO PAST THE BLUE TO 
THE TOP THAT IS ALL THE SHOTS HE 
HAS GOT HE IS HAVING A LITTLE LOOK 
AT THE RED BY THE JELLE BUT I 
CANNOT SEE HIM PLAYING THAT WELL 
YELLOW 
DIDN'T HAVE MUCH IDEA WHETHER CUE 
BALL WAS GOING TO FINISH WHERE 
THERE CUE BALL WAS GOING TO FINISH 
HE HAS SHOWN ONE OR TWO LITTLE 
FRAILTIES IN CLOSING OUT FRAMES HE 
HAS GOT BITS TO LEARN L. JUST THINK 
HE IS IN NICE FORM AND IF HE CAN GO 
THROUGH THIS GAME HE WILL IMPROVE 
IN ROUND TWO 
HE HAS HAD A LITTLE 
CHANCE THAT THE PACK BECAUSE HE 
KNOWS HE WILL LEAVE HIMSELF AN 
ANGLE ON THE BLUE IF THERE IS 
GOING TO BE A PLANT PERHAPS HE 
SHOULD PLAY INTO THE RED SO THE 
PLANT WAS NOT ON WELL HE DECIDED 
TO GO ALL OUT INTO THE PINK AND 
DECIDED THE PLANT WOULD NOT BE ON 
IN FAIRNESS IF THERE WAS ONE THING 
I WOULD SAY ABOUT ROBERT SYNDICATE 
A PLAY THAT KIND OF SHOT HE HIT 
THEM HARDER THAN ANY OTHER PLAYER 
I AGREE WITH HIM HITTING IT HARD 
BUT HE DOES GET PLENTY OF BALLS 
MOVING 
IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE HE CAN MOVING AND HAS REAL ACCURACY AND PACE A 
LOT OF PLAYERS CERTAINLY ONES THAT 
HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME A LONG TIME 
FIND IT HARD TO HIT THE BALL AT 
WILL PACE AND GET ANY ACCURACY 
THE NEXT RED IS NOT THE PROBLEM 
FOR BLACK CLOAKS AWKWARD HE WILL 
DO WELL HERE THE BLACK LOOKS 
AWKWARD THERE IS A RED TO THE 
RIGHT CENTRE THAT HE MIGHT BE ABLE 
TO KNOCKIN KNOCK IN 
THAT HAS 
OPENED THE PICK UP IN TO AT LEAST 
TWO POCKETS NOW THIS IS DEFINITELY 
A CHANCE FOR FRAME AND MATCH NIGEL 
BOND WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF HE 
GOES ON TO LOSE THE GAME IN THIS 
FRAME ROBERTSON HAS UNDOUBTEDLY 
BEEN THE MORE AGGRESSIVE OF THE TWO 
PLAYERS AND OBVIOUSLY THE HIGHEST 
SCORER OF THE TWO PLAYERS 
THIS HE 
CERTAINLY SHOWED WHY HE IS STILL IN 
THE TOP THIRTY TWO HAS NIGEL YES 
OUR THINK THE GOOD THING ABOUT NEIL 
ROBERTSON IS HIS TEMPERAMENT AS WE 
HAVE SAID AND ALSO HE IS A SHOWMAN 
I THINK L. THINK HE IS IN THE 
BEST FORM OF THE SEASON AT THE 
RIGHT TIME AS WELL 
THIS GIVES HIM A LITTLE BIT MORE 
ROOM TO WORK AROUND THE PINK THREE 
MORE REDS THREE COLOURS ROBERTSON 
IS IN THE SECOND ROUND OF THIS 
MAGNIFICENT CHAMPIONSHIP 
NIGEL NOW KNOWS THAT THIS IS THE 
END FOR HIM IN HIS CHAMPIONSHIP 
THIS YEAR HE ALSO HAS REALISED HE 
NEED SNOOKERS PROBABLY MORE TO 
COME FROM THE AUSTRALIAN IN HIS 
BREAK AND A NICE WAY TO FINISH 
NEIL'S HIGHEST BREAK IN THE MATCH 
HAS BEEN EIGHTY A COUPLE OF SEVENTY BREAKS 
LOTS OF FIFTIES MANY MANY THIRTIES HE HAS 
PLAYED WELL 
THAT WASN'T THE BEST OF SHOTS BUT 
THAT WAS 
REALLY BROKE THE BACK OF THE POCKET 
THAT ONE NEELIE BROKER 
I WONDER IF HE WILL TRY AND FREE 
THE BLACK HERE MIGHT DO I THINK THAT IS WHAT HE TRIED 
SO AND EIGHTY FOUR BREAK CONGRATULATIONS 
FROM NIGEL BOND BUT THE MELBOURNE 
MACHINE GOES THROUGH TO ROUND TWO 
WITH A TEN TO FOUR VICTORY 
WE MIGHT CALL HIM THE AMBIDEXTROUS 
AUSTRALIAN AFTER THAT PERFORMANCE 
WE HAVE WHISKED HIM OVER HERE 
WELCOME STEVE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE 
IT WAS ALL THAT FLASH RIGHT HANDED 
STUFF IT IS NOT GOING TO GET YOU 
ANYWHERE BUT CONGRATULATIONS THAT THAT IS PROBABLY THE ONLY RIGHT HANDED 
SHOT A WILL PLAY IN MY CAREER 
THAT'S IT L. WILL LEAVE THAT TO 
RONNIE HE'S THE BEST AT THAT A A POTENTIAL STEPPING STONE IN MANY 
WAYS AGAINST NIGEL 
HE IS A VERY 
EXPERIENCED PLAYER AND ARE STILL IN 
THE TOP EIGHTY TWO L. ATTACKED PRETTY WELL 
I OVER ATTACK SOMETIMES BUT I 
PLAYED REALLY WELL THROUGHOUT THE 
WHOLE MATCH 
THE NEXT MATCH NEIL 
MAGUIRE OR ANTHONY HAMILTON YOU 
PLAY ON SATURDAY I BELIEVE OLDER OLDER BACK TO CAMBRIDGE FOR A FEW TAINS 
AND GET IN SOME GOOD PRACTICE AND 
LOOK FORWARD TO MY NEXT MARCH 
PROBABLY STEPHEN MAGUIRE ON THE 
FORM OF THE SEASON THAT WILL BE A 
TOUGH MATCH 
HERE WE HAVE A FEW 
FANS TO GROLIER FIRSTLY ANTHONY 
WHO IS ELEVEN YEARS OLD AND YOU ARE A 
BIT OF A PLAYER YEAH 
WHAT IS YOUR YEAH HIGHEST BREAK SIXTY TWO 
SIXTY TWO AT THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO ELEVEN YEARS OLD BING WAS ONLY ZERO AT 
THAT TIME AND YOU HAVE NOTABLE 
SCALP AS WELL DON'T SHE 
I BEAT 
GRAEME DOTT ON MONDAY NIGHT WHAT WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION 
WHAT AGE WE WE 
STARTED PLAYING SNOOKER 
SAME AGE 
AS YOU I WAS ELEVEN BY HIGHEST BREAK 
WAS ZERO AS WELL SIXTY TWO IS FANTASTIC 
AS YOUR AGE HE PUT UP 
AND AN 
INTERESTED FATHER WHAT IS IT'S 
LIKE HAVING A YOUNG PROTEGE LIKE 
ANTHONY 
IT IS VERY GOOD FUN DO ANTHONY DO YOU FOLLOW HIS MATCHES 
WE GO TO 
ALL THE MATCHES BUT HE BEAT ME ALL 
THE TIME NOW 
THE QUESTION TO KNEEL 
ARE THERE ANY OTHER AUSTRALIAN 
PLAYERS TO COME OVER AND HELP YOU 
OUT ON THE CIRCUIT 
YEAH THERE ARE 
A FEW THERE ARE QUITE A FEW 
YOUNGER PLAYERS WHO I BELIEVE IF 
THEY GET THE SAME CHANCES THE 
CHINESE PLAYERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN 
THEY COULD EVENTUALLY BREAK INTO 
THE THIRTY TO WONDER BY SUCCESSIVE ARE THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS HELPED 
THEM A LOT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS 
MY SUCCESS OVER THE LAST COUPLE 
OF YEARS HOPEFULLY THEY CAN COME 
OVER TO ENGLAND AND PRACTICE WITH 
THE TOP PLAYERS 
DID YOU WATCH THE 
SESSION THIS MORNING YES FIRST YES FIRST TIME 
SECOND TIME BECAME LAST YEAR TIME AS WELL LAST YEAR YOU WON TWO 
WORLD RANKING TOURNAMENTS HOW WAVE 
FINDING IT THIS YEAR COMPARED TO 
LAST YEAR 
NOT AS GOOD THIS YEAR 
BECAUSE I HAVE HARDLY WON A FIRST 
ROUND MATCH L. GUESS WINNING THE 
TWO TOURNAMENTS LAST YEAR WAS GOING 
TO BE HARD TO REPEAT THIS YEAR L. 
HAVE BEEN PLAYING WELL UP UNTIL 
THIS TOURNAMENT BETTER THAN OTHER 
TOURNAMENTS THIS SEASON HOPEFULLY 
I WAS IT MY BEST FOR THIS 
TOURNAMENT 
BIG SNOOKER FAN AM TOURNAMENT I AM FAVOURITE PLAYER 
NEIL ROBERTSON 
HOW HAVE YOU FOUND THE BUILD UP TO 
THIS YEAR'S TOURNAMENT 
THE BUILD 
UP HAS BEEN GREAT THEY PLAYED IN 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP LEAD LAST WEEK AND 
PLAYED WELL ODSAL BIG BREAK L. 
HAVE BEEN PRACTISING REALLY REALLY 
HARD HAVE NOT HAD ONE SINGLE DAY 
OFF SINCE COMING BACK FROM CHINA L. 
HAVE BEEN PRACTISING VERY HARD THE 
HARDEST FOR ANY TOURNAMENT L. THINK 
THAT HAS REFLECTED IN MY PLAY 
AGAINST NIGEL 
GOOD LUCK FOR THE 
REST OF THE TOURNAMENT 
REMEMBER HIS NAME ANTHONY KEEP IT 
UP NEIL IS ONE OF SEVERAL 
TWENTYSOMETHINGS HAVE BEEN TIPPED 
FOR REALLY GOOD THINGS 
PARTICULARLY IN RESPECT OF THE 
PRIZE AT THE CRUCIBLE ANOTHER IS 
RYAN DAY PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST 
CONSISTENT PLAYERS ON THE CIRCUIT 
HE IS VERY QUIETLY CONFIDENT 
INDIVIDUAL AS OUR RESIDENT 
PATHOLOGIST CAN CONFIRM 
GRAPHOLOGIST GRAPHOLOGIST THIS IS VERY NICE PRINTING IT IS 
SLANTED SHOWING A FRIENDLY NATURE 
BUT IT IS COVERING UP ANY EMOTION 
AS ALWAYS WITH PRINTING THIS IS A 
PERSON WHO WITH HIS SIGNATURE LIKES 
TO KEEP PEOPLE GUESSING AND WITH 
THE PRINTING LIKES TO DO THIS 
FRAME BECAUSE WHEN YOU PRINT YOU 
HIDE YOUR FEELINGS WITH THE 
SIGNATURE IT IS TOTALLY DIFFICULT 
TO GUESS WHAT HIS NAME IS L. CAN 
GET THE LETTER R. AND THE LETTER WHY 
BUT THE REST IS NONDESCRIPT AND 
INCONCLUSIVE THE THING ABOUT IT IS 
THAT HE HAS GOT THE SIGNATURE OF 
JOINING LIKE A MUSHROOM AT THE 
TOP THE SIGNATURE JOINING THAT 
SHOWS HE IS NOT PARTICULARLY 
OUTGOING HE DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE TO 
GET CLOSE TO HIM THEY MIGHT SEE 
HIM IN HIS PERSONA AS A PERFORMER 
AND BE IMPRESSED BECAUSE HIS 
SIGNATURE IS ELABORATE AND BIG BUT 
IN FACT HE IS SHY THE CONSISTENCY 
OF THE SIZE OF THE LETTERS IS AN 
INDICATION OF THE CONSISTENCY OF 
HIS PERFORMANCE HE HAS ORGANISED 
SHAPING THIS ROUNDED ONES 
SHAPINGS HE HAS THE SMOOTH CURVED 
ONES WHICH ARE WHERE HE HAS A 
WARMTH FOR PEOPLE HE ALSO HAS 
ANGULARITY AND HE HAS GOT SOME 
LITTLE HOOKS WHICH I CAN SEE 
THROUGH THE MAGNIFYING GLASS TINY 
LITTLE HOOKS WHICH SHOWS HIS CAN 
SHOWS HIS TENACITY SO THE TOUGH 
SIDE AND THE WARM SIDE THE POINT 
IS HE REALLY WANTS TO GET ON WITH 
PEOPLE HE DOESN'T WANT HASSELL 
AND THAT IS WHY HE HAS SHOWN THE 
PRINTINGS DOESN'T WANT ANY HASSLE 
HE HAS A CLEAN START WHICH IS THE 
WAY HE WANTS TO PLAY L. THINK THERE 
IS POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPING A 
CHARACTER WHICH MIGHT WELL BE VERY 
CLEVER AND INTUITIVE 
IT IS WALES VERSUS IRELAND TODAY 
WHEN RYAN DAY MEETS MICHAEL JUDGE 
THE SELF EFFACING DUBLIN NOW HE IS 
AN UNLUCKY IRISH MAN HE HAS LOST 
SEVEN TIMES IN THE FINAL QUALIFYING 
ROUND 
FOUR OF THOSE WERE IN THE DECIDING 
FRAME THIS IS HIS THIRD APPEARANCE 
AT THE CRUCIBLE HE HAS ONLY HAD 
ONE VICTORY HERE AGAINST A CERTAIN 
JOHN PARROTT IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WE WILL PICK 
THE MATCH UP AT ONE FRAME EACH 
TERRY GRIFFITHS AND JOHN VIRGO WILL 
GUIDE US THROUGH 
ANOTHER GOOD POT THE LOVELY SOUND 
OF IT HITTING THE MIDDLE OF THE 
POCKET IT GIVES YOU THAT LITTLE 
BIT MORE CONFIDENCE THE PINK LOOKS 
TIGHT IT IS NOT A GOOD ANGLE TO 
STAY DOWN FOR THE RED 
THAT WAS MOVE THAT WAS NICE THE 
REASON HE REFUSED THE PINK HE WAS 
HOPING TO BE STRAIGHT ON IT 
THE POSITION HE WAS IN HE HAD TO 
DO A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HE WOULD 
LIKE TO GET ON THE REDS SO PLAYING 
THE BLUE WHICH HE PLAYED 
BEAUTIFULLY HE WILL BE LOOKING 
IMMEDIATELY TO GET ON THE RED TO 
THE LEFT OF THE BLACK 
BECAUSE THAT IN EFFECT WILL CLEAR 
THE BLACK FOR BOTH CORNER POCKETS 
WHEN THAT IS THE CASE EVERY CHANCE 
OF MAKING A FRAME WINNING 
CONTRIBUTION O. THE DOORS BUT SIGNS 
THAT RYAN IS SETTLING IN IT IS 
EARLY DOORS 
YOU WERE RIGHT JOHN YOU CAN TELL 
ALWAYS WITH THE BODY LANGUAGE HE 
LOOKED VERY EDGY IN THE FIRST FEW 
FRAMES 
HE'S MOVING ROUND THE TABLE IN A 
NICE WITH THEM PREVIOUSLY HE WAS 
RUSHING IN BETWEEN SHOTS AND THEN 
TAKING TOO LONG TO PLAY THEM WHICH 
IS CERTAINLY NOT HIS WAY TO PLAY 
HE IS MOVING WITH A NICE RHYTHM 
IF HE HAD PICKED IT CUE BALL UP AND 
PUT IT THERE WITH HIS HAND HE 
COULD NOT HAVE PUT IN A BETTER 
PLACE THAN THAT 
A FRAME WINNING CHANCE NOW YOU YOU CAN'T SAY THE WELSH ARE LUCKY JOHN 
THAT'S DISCRIMINATION 
I DIDN'T SAY 
THEY WERE LUCKY 
I DIDN'T SAY THEY WERE LUCKY I 
SAID THEY WERE LEEKY A BIT UNLUCKY 
HE WAS LUCKY TO GET THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE AND 
RUN INTO THE CLUSTER OF FOUR L. DON'T BLAME HIM 
AFTER THIS RED AND THE BLUE AND 
YOU WOULD THINK JUST ONE MORE RED 
REQUIRED HE IS JUST ABOUT ON IT 
ALWAYS REMEMBER FOR EVERY RED THAT 
IS POTTED EIGHT POINTS HAVE GONE 
OFF THE POTENTIAL SCORE HE HAS TAKEN THESE VERY WELL 
THAT'S DISAPPOINTING BUT IT WON'T 
MATTER TO RYAN DAY HE NOW LEADS TWO 
ONE 
THEY WENT TO THE INTERVAL ALL 
SQUARE SO HERE WE ARE NOW WHEN THE 
FIFTH IN THE FIFTH ROUND 
IN AN EFFORT TO HIT IT VERY THIN 
HE MISSED THE BALL COMPLETELY 
HE HAS HAD A LOOK AROUND AND WITH 
THE BLACK TIED UP IT MAY BE WORTH 
TRYING TO DISLODGE THE PINK 
IT IS NOT EASY TO MAKE BREAKS OF 
AND BAULK COLOURS HE HAS 
PLAYED A GOOD SHOT THERE THE RED 
BEHIND THE PINK THAT WILL OPEN IT 
OUT A LITTLE BIT 
THE PINK SPOT IS AVAILABLE YOU CAN 
IT NOW IT WILL GO INTO ONE OF 
THE CORNERS AND POSSIBLY BOTH 
MIDDLES 
I AM NOT QUITE SURE WHAT HE PLAYED 
THERE HE'S NOT ON A RED L. DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE PLAYED TO CANNON 
VERY UNSETTLING FOR THE PLAY YEARS 
OUT THERE WHEN THEY PLAY LIKE THIS 
THE PLAYERS NOT EASY TO GET 
CONFIDENCE WHEN YOU ON MISSING 
SHOTS YOU EXPECT TO POT WHEN YOU 
ARE MISSING WE HAVE SEEN ALREADY 
IN THIS CHAMPIONSHIP THE RED CAN 
MOVE UP THE TABLE IF YOU AIM 
TOWARDS THE FAR KNUCKLE AS WE CALL 
IT IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE 
HAVE SEEN THAT 
I AM CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO SAY IT 
IS A FRAME WINNING CHANCE THE WAY 
THINGS HAVE GONE IT IS A LITTLE 
AWKWARD BRIDGING OVER THE RED 
HE HAS JUST UNDERDONE THAT SLIGHTLY 
HE WOULD PREFER TO BE STRAIGHTER ON 
THE PINK 
ALL PINK SO FAR IN THIS EFFORT OF 
FORTY THREE FROM RYAN DAY 
HE'S PLAYING FOR THE BLUE SO SIXTY SIX 
POINTS HE WILL BE THIS BLUE AND 
ONE MORE RED 
WHEN YOU MAKE A MISTAKE ENJOY 
OPPONENT DOESN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
IT YOU CAN EASILY ERASE IT FROM 
YOUR MIND AND YOUR OPPONENT HE 
NEEDS TO STEP UP MICHAEL THE 
MATCH COULD SLIP AWAY HEAVY 
CONTACT ON THE RED BUT IT WENT IN 
THE FRAME IS OVER AND DONE WITH 
NOW A CHANCE FOR THE FIRST CENTURY 
BREAK OF THIS MATCH 
WELL ISN'T THAT AMAZING IT JUST 
ABOUT SUMS UP THE MATCH SO FAR 
JUST WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING 
TO GET EASY IT GETS HARD RYAN DAY 
WON'T MIND THE MISSED CENTURY 
HE LOOKS TO BE ON A MISSION HE 
PROBABLY HAS FRESH MEMORIES OF THE 
LAST TIME HE AND MICHAEL JUDGE 
PLAYED AT THE WELSH OPEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
AND MICHAEL THRASHED HIM IN WE GO 
TO FRAME SIX NOW MICHAEL JUDGE IS 
THIRTY SEVEN POINTS BEHIND 
IT IS IMPERATIVE YOU TRY AND STAY 
IN AND AROUND THE BLACK BECAUSE OF 
WHERE THE RED CELLS UNLESS HE 
WANTS TO GO FOR A BAULK COLOUR 
THE REDS OF 
THAT WAS WELL PLAYED HE LEFT 
HIMSELF A NICE ANGLE ON THE GREEN 
ONCE AGAIN HE HAS DRIFTED OUT OF 
POSITION 
THAT'S 
THE PROBLEM WHEN POSITION THE CUE BALL HAS TO TRAVEL 
DISTANCES LIKE TO GO FOR THE GREEN 
HE FINISHED PERFECT BUT THEN HE HAD 
TO JUDGE THE DISTANCE BACK TO THE 
REDS HE HASN'T REALLY BEEN THAT 
STRONG IN THE BREAK BUILDING HE 
HAS ONLY MADE ONE BREAK AND THAT 
WAS A BREAK OF THIRTY FOUR IN THE FIRST 
FRAME HE IS MAKING HARD WORK OF 
THIS OPPORTUNITY 
HE HAD TO PLAY AT TACTICAL TOUCH 
SHOT AND HE CAN GET THE CUE BALL 
CLOSER TO THE BLACK AND IT IS NOW 
HE COULDN'T GET 
AND THAT IS O. K. BUT READ THEIR HE 
IS HAVING LOOK THERE ARE TWO CHOICES 
I THOUGHT HE ONLY HAD TO RUN 
THROUGH AND HE WOULD MAKE A CONTACT 
WITH THE SECOND READ THAT HE TRIED 
TO MIX IT AND HE GOT THE SECOND 
CONTACT BY PLAYING IN LITTLE BIT OF 
A STAND SHOP SHOCK 
HE PLEADED WELL HE PLAYED IT 
WELL NINE POINTS BEHIND AN 
EXCELLENT CHANCE THIS IS HE WOULD 
BE VERY DISAPPOINTED NOW MICHAEL 
IF HE DOES NOT CLOSE THE FRAME THAT 
THIS VISIT HE WILL NOT NEED THE 
AWKWARD BLUE 
HE DID NOT GET INTO THAT HE IS O. K. 
ON THE PINK 
OF COURSE THESE ARE THE FRIENDS 
YOU HAVE GOT TO WIN BECAUSE 
MICHAELCHURCH OBESE SITTING IN 
HIS DAY AND THERE WAS A NINETY FIVE IN THE 
PREVIOUS FRAME THE REDS WERE 
PLACED PERFECTLY HE MAY STILL WELL 
LOSE THE FRAME ESPECIALLY WITH 
THAT SHOT IT IS JUST NOT HAPPENING 
IF HE PLAYS FOR THE YELLOW HE IS 
GOING TO NEED THE BLUE 
HE WILL BE O. K. WITH THE YELLOW 
GREEN AND BROWN HE WOULD BE NINETEEN 
POINTS IN FRONT WITH EIGHTEEN LEFT ON THE 
TABLE 
ONCE AGAIN HE HAD HIS CHANCE IN 
THE YEAR ON RYAN DID NOT MAKE THE 
MOST OF IT BUT MICHAEL JUDGES NOT 
PUNISHING HIS MISTAKES MICHAEL 
JUDGE IS NOT PUNISHING HIS MISTAKES APPLAUSE 
THE THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD MICHAEL JUDGE WILL 
BE ANNOYED 
ABOUT LOSING THE 
MISSING VERPLANK IN THE AIR IN THE 
FRAME THE PINK 
HE OVERHIT THAT'S LIKELY THE BLACK 
IS AVAILABLE HE OVERHIT THAT 
SLIGHTLY 
THAT IS BETTER MICHAEL HE MISSED 
TWO OF THOSE IN EARLIER ON 
A CLEAR MIND IS NEEDED HERE THE 
BALLS ARE WELL SET BUT IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO CLEAR YOUR MIND WHEN 
YOU HAVE DOUBTS IN THEIR 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE GREEN BUT THE 
OTHER MAY HAVE BEEN THE BETTER 
COLOUR TO PLAY HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO 
COME DOWN THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF 
THE TABLE AND HIS INCH PERFECT ON 
THE RED TO NOW HE WILL BE ABLE TO 
PLAY FOR THE BLACK 
THERE ARE A FEW TRICKY RED SO LONG 
THIS CUSHION REDS IT IS HARD OUT THERE 
DISAPPOINTED THERE THE SESSION HAS 
FINISHED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
BOARD SO THE SCREEN GOES UP AND NOW 
THEY HAVE THE ARENA TO THEMSELVES 
NO DISTRACTIONS 
I WOULDN'T SAY 
THAT JOHN WHEN THE SCREEN GOES UP 
IT CAN HAVE QUITE AN EFFECT ON YOU 
IT IS A BIT LIKE GOING FROM PLAYING 
IN YOUR FRONT ROOM TO PLAYING IN 
THE FIELD ON THE OTHER HAND IT 
MIGHT INSPIRE YOU IF YOU ON A 
DOWNER AT THERE OUT THERE 
MICHAEL JUDGE HAS AN UNUSUAL 
APPROACH TO THE TABLE 
IT SEEMS TO WORK FOR HIM HE HAS 
ALWAYS DONE THAT THERE IT IS YOU 
SEE THE CUE LAYING DOWN ON THE LINE 
OF THE SHOT HE WRAPS HIS BODY 
AROUND IT 
HE PLAYED THAT WELL 
THIRTY FIVE POINTS THAT 
LEAD THERE ARE ONLY FORTY POINTS 
HE IS LOOKING FOR A RED AND A 
COLOUR NOW BUT THE RED IS NOT CERTAINTY 
WELL DONE BECAUSE HE WAS UNDER A 
LOT OF PRESSURE EVENT 
NO HEROICS HE KNEW THAT WAS THE 
FRAME BALL FORTY EIGHT AHEAD FORTY THREE REMAINING 
IT WAS AN IMPORTANT FRAME THERE 
WERE SIGNS THAT MAYBE RYAN DAY WAS 
GOING TO OPEN A BIG GAP BUT ALL 
THINGS BEING EQUAL THAT WILL 
REDUCE HIS ARREARS TO FOUR TO THREE 
IT DID AND THE DUBLINER SEEMS 
DETERMINED TO MAKE SURE HE MAKES 
THE MOST OF HIS FIRST VISIT TO THE 
CRUCIBLE IN SIX YEARS HE RIGA DAY 
IS SIX POINTS IN FRONT WITH ONLY 
THE COLOURS REMAINING HERE WE GO 
HE HAS PLAYED THAT SHOT A COUPLE OF 
TIMES NOW THAT COULD DECIDE THE 
OUTCOME OF THIS FRAME HE HAS GOT 
TO HIT THIS AND WE KNOW HE HAS GOT 
TO HIT IT OTHERWISE THE WHISTLE 
WILL BE CALLED IF HE DOESN'T HIT 
IT CAN HE GET IT SAY SAFE 
THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM AROUND THIS 
YEAR OH GOOD HIT THIS YELLOW 
EXCELLENT HIT KEEPS HIS HOPES IN 
THIS FRAME ALIVE 
AND NICE LITTLE TOUCH THERE FROM 
RYAN DAY 
IN AN IDEAL WORLD HE WOULD LIKE TO 
CONTACT THE YELLOW HE CAN TAKE 
THAT DOWN TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE 
TABLE THAT IS NOT WHAT HE WANTED 
BUT IF THERE IS NO ANGLE FOR RYAN 
DAY IT COULD BE O. K. HE CAN POT THE 
YELLOW BUT I DON'T THINK HE CAN GET 
ON TO THE BROWN AFTER TAKING ON THE 
GREEN FRACTIONS JOHN ISN'T IT 
ABSOLUTELY IF HE HAD HAD THE 
PERFECT ANGLE ON THE YELLOW YOU 
WOULD HAVE SAID IT IS GAME OVER 
BUT LOTS CAN GO WRONG WITH A SHOP 
LIKE THIS IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE HE 
HAS AN ANGLE TO COME ROUND TO THE 
BLACK AND COME BACK UP TO THE BAULK 
END 
HOW DOES HE POT THE GREEN AND GET 
ON THE BROWN NIGH ON IMPOSSIBLE INCREDIBLE FILE FINAL 
LOOK HOW FAR HE MISSED THE GREEN BY 
A BIT CHANCY THAT ONE 
THIS FRAME IS GETTING NEAR THE FORTY 
MINUTE MARK BY FAR THE LONGEST 
FRAME OF THE MATCH SO FAR AND IT 
COULD BE GOING TO MICHAEL JUDGE HE 
IS JUST FOUR POINTS BEHIND IF HE 
COULD POT THIS GREEN IT WOULD MAKE 
HIM FAVOURITE FOR THE FRAME 
NOT JUST A GOOD SHOT BUT AN 
EXCELLENT POSITIONAL SHOT FOR THE 
BROWN A LOT OF BACKSPIN TO HOLD 
THE CUE BALL HE IS PERFECT NOW 
FIRST GAME IS SUITING MICHAEL JUDGE 
AT THE MOMENT IF IT WAS OPEN I 
THINK YOU WOULD FANCY YOU MARK ROWE 
YOU WOULD FANCY RYAN DAY MOVING 
IN FRONT 
TWO FRAMES ON THE TROT FROM MICHAEL 
JUDGE HE IS BACK TO FOUR TO FOUR 
PLENTY OF 
SUPPORT FOR MICHAEL JUDGE IN THE 
ARENA AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS 
BEGINNING TO ENJOY HIMSELF OUT 
THERE DOESN'T IT HE NOW HAS A FORTY ONE 
POINTS LEAD IN THE LAST FRAME 
ALTHOUGH HE HAS JUST BROKEN DOWN 
DAY TO PLAY IT'S NOT THE BEST SHOT IS IT 
IT IS A GOOD POT BUT HE HAS NOT 
COMPLETELY RECOVERED THE SITUATION 
BY WOULD NOT EXPECT HIM TO MISS 
THIS BLUE I WOULD NOT 
IT IS NOT IDEAL BUT HE COULD BRING 
FIT TO REDS ABOVE THE BLACK KING TO 
PLAY AS WELL HERE BRING THE TWO 
REDS THOSE TO READ ABOUT THE BLACK 
AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE 
CUSHION ARE SLIGHT PROBLEM BALLS 
HE HASN'T PLAYED THAT THEY WILL 
DIDN'T GET THE NECESSARY SPIN ON 
IT HAS RUN TOO FAR AWAY AT THE 
TABLE NEVER HIT THIS ONE HE 
NEEDED THE CUE BALL ABOUT SIX 
INCHES TO THE RIGHT ON THAT BOTTOM 
CUSHION 
HE HAS GIVEN HIMSELF A FRAME 
WINNING CHANCE NOW THAT 
UNBELIEVABLE MISS FROM MICHAEL 
JUDGE IT PROBABLY SUMS UP THE 
MATCH SO FAR THEY HAVE BEEN SO 
MANY UNFORCED ERRORS 
MICHAEL IS LOOKING A STRONG 
FAVOURITE TO TAKE THIS FINAL FRAME 
OF THE SESSION 
THE FIRST FOUR FRAMES IT WAS O. K. 
BUT HE WENT A LITTLE BIT SCRAPPY 
BOTH PLAYERS COULDN'T FIND THEIR 
BEST FORM AND THAT AFFECTED THEM L. 
DON'T THINK RYAN DAY WILL BE THAT 
PLEASED WITH HIS PERFORMANCE NOR 
WILL MICHAEL JUDGE THESE NINE 
FRAMES ARE GOING TO BE OVER AND I 
THINK WE WILL SEE THE HAND SHAKE 
NO MAYBE NOT BUT THAT SHOULD BE 
ENOUGH TO INSURE RYAN DAY GOES INTO 
THE NEXT SESSION 
FIVE TO FOUR IT FINISHES AND THEY WILL COME 
BACK TO FINISH THAT MATCH TOMORROW 
MORNING RYAN DAY IS THE WORLD NO 
SIXTEEN BUT HE IS UP TO NUMBER SEVEN HE 
HAS DONE SO QUITE QUIETLY WHAT ARE 
HIS STRENGTHS 
HE IS A VERY HEAVY 
SCORER HE IS VERY FLUENT HE LIKES 
TO GET IN THERE AND MAKE BIG BREAKS 
IT IS ONE OF THOSE PLAYERS WHO 
SERVED HIS APPRENTICESHIP HAS HAD 
A FEW YEARS' EXPERIENCE ON THE 
CIRCUIT AND NOW FEELS HE IS READY 
HE HAS REACHED THE FINAL IN 
SHANGHAI HE WAS IN A SEMI FINAL IN 
CHINA HE IS GETTING VERY CLOSE TO 
FINALS 
HE SEEMS TO PLAY VERY WELL FINALS THE FAR EAST WE KNOW IT IS HIS 
AMBITION TO DO IT AT HOME WHY DOES 
MICHAEL JUDGE MAKE THINGS SO 
DIFFICULT 
PROBABLY BECAUSE MICHAEL DIFFICULT JUDGE NEVER BEATS MICHAEL JUDGE HE 
IS A CONSISTENT PLAYER HE IS TOUGH 
TO GET PAST YOU KNOW WHEN YOU PLAY 
HIM THERE IS A CERTAIN LEVEL OF 
PERFORMANCE SOMETIMES HE PLAYS TO 
HIS ABSOLUTE BEST BUT HE NEVER DIPS 
HE IS LIKE A PARK ON A GOLF COURSE 
HE IS ALWAYS THE SAME AND DIFFICULT 
TO GET PAST 
THE WILL SEE HARRY 
GETS ON TOMORROW MORNING PLENTY 
HAS BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE NEXT 
LAST LAST COUPLE OF DAYS LET'S 
REMIND YOU OF THE STATE OF THE DRAW 
AND HOW THINGS STAND AT THE MOMENT JOHN HIGGINS COMPLETED HIS WIN OVER

WILL BE SEEING FORMER CHAMPION 
GRAEME DOTT TAKE ON JOE PERRY IN 
THEIR RYAN THEY AROUND ONE MATCH 
THERE WILL CHAMPION SHIP WOULD BE 
THE SAME WITHOUT STEPHEN HENDRY HE 
WILL SET EVEN MORE RECORDS HERE 
BECAUSE THIS IS HIS TWENTY THIRD 
CONSECUTIVE APPEARANCE THAT IS ONE 
MORE THAN STEVE DAVIS MANAGED L. 
THINK YOU MAKE TWENTY ONE APPEARANCES JOHN 
IT IS WORTH LOOKING AT SOME OF THE 
STATS ASSOCIATED WITH STEPHEN 
HENDRY REALLY HIS RECORD IS 
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IMPECCABLE 
IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES HE RULED THE SPORT 
HE'S HELD OFF A LITTLE BIT THIS 
DECADE BUT HE STILL CONSISTENTLY 
MADE IT TO THE LATTER PART OF 
TOURNAMENTS THE QUARTERS THE 
SEMIS L. WONDER HOW DOES STEPHEN 
RATE HIS OWN FORM COMING INTO THE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS THIS YEAR 
I HAVE BEEN PLAYING REALLY WELL IN 
PRACTISE ALL YEAR L. HAVE HIT THE 
BALL BETTER THAN EVER BUT WHEN I 
HAVE COME UP AGAINST PEOPLE IT HAS 
NOT BEEN THE SAME THING ONE OF BY 
WITNESSES IS IF I'M NOT PLAYING 
WELL TENDING TO PUSH IT A BIT 
PUSHING THE BOAT OUT AND PROBLEMS 
HAVE MOUNTED THINGS GO FROM BAD TO 
WORSE PLAYING POORLY HAS BEEN AT 
FAULT NOTHING TO DO WITH EXTRA 
EXPECTATIONS OBVIOUSLY COMING 
HERE I HAD EXPEDITIONS OF WINNING 
BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN PLAYING WELL 
ENOUGH EXPECTATIONS OF WINNING 
I AM NOT GOING TO PUT EXPECTATIONS 
ON MYSELF BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE 
DONE THAT ALL SEASON AND I'VE HAD 
NO RESULTS SO THERE IS NO POINT 
COMING HERE AND EXPECTING THAT THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS MEAN IT IS 
GOING TO CHANGE I'M CONFIDENT THE 
WAY I HAVE BEEN PLAYING AND THAT 
IS ALL YOU CAN SAVE YOU CANNOT 
JUDGE ANYTHING UNTIL YOU GET OUT IN 
THE ARENA 
STEVE AND HENDRY 
STEPHEN HENDRY MARK ALAN 
HE HE'S 
A GOOD STRONG PLAYER HE HAS 
IMPROVED QUICKLY HE TURNED PRO 
THREE YEARS AGO OR SO BUT LOOKS 
LIKE BEING A TOP SIXTEEN PLAYER NOW 
THAT SHOWS WHAT A STRONG PLAYER HE 
IS IF I'M PLAYING WELL I FANCY MY 
CHANCES BUT IF I DON'T I HAVE ALL 
THOSE SIMPLE AS THAT IF YOU GO 
OUT THERE WITH THE RIGHT ATTITUDE 
PLAY THE RIGHT SHOT CONCENTRATE 
IT DOESN'T MATTER FOR ME IT 
DOESN'T MATTER WHO IS IN THE OTHER 
CHAIR I WILL BEAT THEM BUT IF 
THEY DON'T GO RIGHT I COULD LOSE T. 
U. MAYBE NOT BUT CLOSE 
NINE YEARS 
SINCE HE LAST WON THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS CAN HE WIN AGAIN HE HE WILL NEED TO BE AT HIS ABSOLUTE 
BEST THE STANDARDS ARE VERY HIGH 
I THINK HE'S ONE RESORT AWAY FROM 
PLAYING WELL HE HAS GOT AN IDEAL 
OPPORTUNITY HE HAS A TOUGH MATCH 
COMING UP BUT IF HE CAN GET PAST 
AND PLAY WELL HE MIGHT TAKE OFF 
BUT IT IS A BIG IF 
I LOVE WATCHING 
WHAT ALAN PLAY YOU CAN SEE THE 
ADRENALIN CHARGING THROUGH HIS BODY 
MARK ALAN IN THE FIRST ROUND HE 
HAS BEATEN STEPHEN HENDRY BEFORE 
HE LOOKED CONFIDENT WANTED TO BEAT 
HIM OF COURSE STEPHEN DID NOT 
HAVE ANY ANSWERS ONE OF THE FACT 
IS FOR ME IS STEPHEN'S LONG GAME 
HE USED TO HAVE A DEVASTATING ONE 
HIS LONG GAME USED TO BE HIS 
SALVATION IF HE WAS IN TROUBLE 
SAFETY WISE HE WOULD FIND A LONG 
POT THAT DOES TWO THINGS IT GETS 
YOU OUT OF TROUBLE AND GIVES YOU 
THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN THE LONG 
BALLS DO NOT GO IN THOSE 
OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOT YOURS 
IS IT 
AGE 
THERE IS A BIT OF THAT MAYBE AGE MOTIVATION THE MAN HAS WON 
EVERYTHING THERE IS TO WIN AND HIS 
RECORD IS PHENOMENAL 
STEVE DAVIS 
I'M SURE THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF 
ANTICIPATION BACKSTAGE THIS THIS CERTAINLY IS BACKSTAGE AS ALWAYS 
PRETTY NERVY I'M GOING TO BE DOING 
IT TOMORROW AS USUAL ONE MATCH 
STARTING THE OTHER MATCH FINISHING 
OFF THE MATCH BETWEEN CARTER AND 
HAWKINS HAWKINS WAS THREE TO ONE IN FRONT 
BUT CARTER TURNED IT AROUND TO SIX TO THREE 
THEY FINISH IT OFF THE MATCH WE 
ARE GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON IT IS 
STEPHEN HENDRY AGAINST THE LATEST 
NORTHERN IRELAND SENSATION MARK 
ALAN IT IS A TOUGH MATCH TO CALL 
I WOULDN'T TRY AND MAKE A 
PREDICTION WITH THE PLAYERS IN 
EARSHOT SO IT IS BEST TO TURN IT 
OVER TO OUR M. C. 
FIRST OUT A YOUNG MAN WITH A REAL 
FIGHT ON HIS HANDS THIS AFTERNOON 
RANKED NINETEENTH IN THE WORLD WILL HAVE 
TO PLAY HIS BEST SNOOKER TO WIN 
BARRY HAWKINS 
HE'S UP AGAINST THE WORLD'S NUMBER 
FOURTEEN WHO MADE THE COURT QUARTER 
FINALS LAST YEAR FROM ESSEX 
PLEASE WELCOME ALI CARTER 
ON TABLE ONE A VERY TALENTED 
PLAYER FROM NORTHERN IRELAND A 
TREMENDOUS POTTER HE STARTED THE 
SEASON RANKED TWENTY NINE HE IS ON THE 
VERGE OF MAKING THE TOP SIXTEEN PLEASE 
WELCOME MARK AND THEN MARK ALAN 
AND THIS MAN NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION 
WHATSOEVER IN THE NINETIES HE 
DOMINATED THIS EVENT CAPTURING THE 
TITLE A RECORD BREAKING SEVEN TIMES 
ONE OF THE ALL TIME GREATS FROM 
SCOTLAND STEPHEN HENDRY 
WELL DONE MARK ALAN 
SERIOUS STUFF NOW HE IS AT 
SPOTTING IT SPORTING TO NEW RED 
STRIPE ON HIS BONNET VERY STYLISH 
NINE FRAMES TO PLAY THIS AFTERNOON 
JOHN VIRGO AND DENNIS TAYLOR IN THE 
COMMENTARY BOX 
BOTH JOHN AND 
MYSELF ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD 
TO THIS ONE JOHN IS GOING TO HAVE 
A TOUCH OF THE RED IN HIS HAIR AS 
WELL 
ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO WELL THIS 
A YES IT HAS THE INGREDIENTS THIS OF A REALLY GOOD MATCH UP STEPHEN STEPHEN HENDRY HAS NOT BEEN AT HIS BEST IT 
IS A BIG CHALLENGE FOR ANYONE TO 
PLAY THE SEVEN TIMES WORLD CHAMPION 
AT THE CRUCIBLE THERE WILL BE NO 
HANGING ABOUT HERE EITHER 
BOTH ATTACKING PLAYERS WE ARE IN 
FOR A GOOD MATCH SOMETHING VERY 
INTERESTING TO WATCH THIS AFTERNOON 
IT IS A TRICKY LONG POT THAT HE WAS 
LOOKING AT THERE ESPECIALLY WITH 
THE CUE BALL HEADING INTO THE REDS 
AND BLACKS A LITTLE BIT OF A 
CHANCE OF TAKING THE ONE TO THE 
RIGHT AND GETTING ROUND THE BACK OF 
THE REDS AND THE BLACK THAT WAS 
CLOSE 
THAT IS ONE OF HIS TRADEMARK SHOT 
THE LONG POT AS HIS WITH A LONG 
LOT OF THE YOUNG PLAYERS THIS YEAR 
STEPHEN HENDRY'S FIRST PART IN THIS 
YEAR'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP FIRST 
POT 
I THINK STEPHEN HENDRY IS ONE POT GOOD MATCH AWAY FROM REALLY GETTING 
BACK INTO THE FORMER THAT HE HAS 
SHOWN THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER THE 
FORMER HE IS STILL DOING IT IN 
PRACTICE IT IS DIFFERENT WHEN YOU 
GET OUT THERE 
YES AND THE LONGER 
IT TAKES TO TRANSFER THAT PRACTICE 
PLAYED TO THE MATCH TABLE THAN 
MORE YOU BEGIN TO DOUBT YOURSELF A 
GOOD START WOULD HELP 
HE HAS QUITE A WAY TO TRAVEL WITH 
THE CUE BALL HERE BUT HE CAN AVOID 
THE BROWN AND GREEN HERE 
LOOKS REALLY GOOD TO ME IT NEEDS 
TO FLICK THE REDS AND HE'S FINE HE 
MIGHT JUST GET THAT COULD START 
THAT YOU MENTIONED JOHN GOOD 
START 
HAVING SAID THAT I THINK THAT HAS 
GONE TOO FAR HE IS OUT OF POSITION 
ALWAYS TAKES A WHILE TO GET USED TO 
THE TABLE AND THE CUSHIONS AND 
LOOK AT THAT THIS TABLE YESTERDAY 
WAS BOUNCING LITTLE BIT OFF THE 
SIDE CUSHION I'M JUST WONDERING IF 
THAT WAS FUNNY BOUNCE OFF THE BACK CUSHION 
THIS WAS THE SHOT HE PLAYED AND 
PLENTY OF MARGIN FOR ERROR JUST 
SEEMED TO HIT IT LITTLE BIT TOO HARD 
GOT THAT ALL WRONG UNLESS IT THERE 
IS A PLANT HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT 
IT IS CLOSE BUT HE WILL HAVE TO 
MAKE IT INTO A THREE BALL PLANT 
AND I'M NOT CERTAIN HE CAN THE 
MAIN REASON HE PUT TAKE IT ON HE 
IS TURNING THE CUE BALL BACK TO THE 
BAULK END SO NOT TOO MUCH RISK 
INVOLVED BUT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT 
WILL GO INTO THE SIDE JAW 
HE IS JUST PICKING AT A SPOT ON THE 
CUSHION WHERE HE WILL WANT TO KNOCK 
THE FIRST RED ONTO WHICH LINES UP 
THE PLANT L. THINK HE WILL MAKE THIS 
NOT IDEALLY PLACED 
BUT HE HAS A 
CHANCE OF THE BROWN GREEN IS AN 
EASIER POT BUT I DON'T THINK HE 
HAS GOT AN ANGLE ON THE GREEN 
THERE IS NOT A LOT THAT WILL GO IN 
THAT CORNER JUST SINGLE RED THE 
OTHERS ORRELL BLOCKING EACH OTHER 
ARE ALL BLOCKING EACH OTHER 
NOT THE PERFECT ANGLE ON THE BLUE 
A LITTLE BIT STRAIGHT HE IS 
THINKING ABOUT THE PINK BUT THERE 
IS A RED AVAILABLE TO THE LEFT 
CORNER IF HE JUST ROLLS THE BLUE IN 
NOT IDEALLY SITUATED HERE HE NEEDS 
TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN WITH THE 
NEXT SHOT A CANNON ONTO THE TWO 
REDS TO THE LEFT OF THE BUNCH MIGHT 
JUST DEVELOP THINGS HE CERTAINLY 
HAS TO CANNON INTO SOMETHING HERE 
TO OPEN IT UP 
IT IS A DECENT CHANCE NOW JUST 
NEEDED ANY SORT OF CANNON ON THOSE 
TWO 
A AMAZING WITH STEPHEN HE LOOKS 
TERRIFIC HE GETS IN THE BALLS 
GREAT A GOOD CHANCE AND THEN HE 
MISSES STRAIGHTFORWARD POT THAT 
IS HARD TO TAKE WHEN YOU HAVE DONE 
WHAT HE HAS DONE IN THE GAME IT IS 
A BIT CONFUSING AND IRRITATING 
THAT IS GOING TO BE A BIT 
IRRITATING FOR THE OR NORTHERN 
IRELAND PLAYER YELLOW 
A LET OFF FOR STEPHEN MARK ALLEN 
WILL NOT BE TOO HAPPY THERE WHEN 
YOUR OPPONENTS MAKES A MISTAKE AT 
THIS LEVEL IF YOU PUNISHMENT THAT 
MISTAKES STAYS IN THE MIND IF 
YOU PUNISH THEM IF YOU DON'T 
I THINK HE'S OKAY HERE HE HAS GOT 
A SLIGHT ANGLE TO GET OUT FOR THE 
BLACK 
IT WAS STRAIGHT BUT NO PROBLEM 
ALREADY FORTY SIX IN FRONT 
WHEN STEPHEN HENDRY WAS DOMINATING 
THE GAME IN THE NINETIES HE ALWAYS 
SEEMED TO START VERY WELL INDEED 
ALWAYS SEEMS TO MAKE A BIG BREAK IN 
THE OPENING FRAME 
STEVE DAVIS ALWAYS DID THE SAME IN 
THE EIGHTIES GET OFF TO GOOD START 
HE HAS GOT TO AND DEVELOP 
SOMETHING HERE JUST CATCHING THE 
PINK DIDN'T HELP UNLESS THERE IS A 
RED ON TO THE RIGHT MIDDLE I THINK 
THAT IS THE END OF BREAK STILL A 
POSSIBLE SIXTY SEVEN LEFT ON THE TABLE IT 
IS NOT OVER JUST YET 
HE CAUGHT THE 
PINK HE DID NOT INTEND TO DO THAT 
HE WANTED TO CANNON THE RED HE HAD TO DEVELOP SOMETHING JUST 
WATCH THE WHITE IT JUST FLICKED 
THE PINK AND SPOILED IT 
HE HAS HAD PRECIOUS LITTLE TO GO AT 
AND THAT HAS FINISHED AWKWARD MARK 
ALLEN HAS JUST HAD ONE GO AT A POT 
IT IS GREAT TO SEE HIM HERE THOUGH 
NICE TO HAVE A PLAYER FROM NORTHERN 
IRELAND FLYING THE FLAG HE IS 
CAPABLE OF WINNING A WORLD TITLE 
THIS PLAYER UNLUCKY 
THE FIRST TOP CLASS PLAYER FROM 
NORTHERN IRELAND TO PLAY IT LEFT 
HANDED I'M SURE LIMA COST AND GOOD 
AMATEURS AROUND THERE ARE SOME 
GOOD AMATEURS AROUND 
THAT WAS A MISS FROM STEPHEN HE 
WILL BE FORTUNATE WELL IF HE HAS 
COVERED THAT RED THAT IS OVER THE 
CORNER POCKET HAD HE HAS AND HE 
HAS THAT RED HE ATTEMPTED IT WOULD 
HAVE CLINCHED THE FRAME 
HE MAY BE 
FORCED HERE TO TRY AND POT THAT RED 
OVER THE POCKET ANY OTHER POT HE 
LOOKS IT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT 
THAN ATTEMPTING THAT HE HAS GOT TO 
REMOVE THAT RED 
THIS IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THE 
ONE DOWN THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE 
TABLE 
HE WENT ALL OUT FOR THE POT HE 
KNEW THAT IF HE GOT IT THE CHANCE 
OF GETTING BACK IN THE FRAME IF HE 
MISSED IT HE WOULD LOSE THE FRAME 
STEPHEN JUST WANTS THIS RED 
HE DIDN'T REALLY ATTEMPT TO 
POSITION THERE HE JUST MADE SURE 
OF THE BLACK THAT IS THE REASON HE 
IS NOT ON THIS RED 
MARK ALLEN WILL CARRY ON JUST TO 
TRY AND SETTLE DOWN 
AT THE MOMENT HE NEEDS FOUR POINTS 
JUST TO TIE 
HE CAN CUT THIS RED INTO THE MIDDLE 
BUT AT THE MOMENT HE JUST HAS A 
KICK CASE OF THE NEAR LEES HE IS 
CONCEDING WHICH IS NOT NORMALLY 
THE FORM BUT THAT IS A LITTLE BIT 
OF FRUSTRATION 
THE IMPASSIVE FACE TO STEPHEN 
HENDRY THERE L. WONDER WHAT THE 
TACTICS WILL BE TO TRY AND 
NULLIFIED THIS ADRENALIN CHARGE TO 
PLAY OUT 
I DON'T THINK STEPHEN 
HENDRY EVER GOES OUT WITH TACTICS 
TO DO THAT AGAINST A PLAYER 
ALTHOUGH HE KNOWS THAT MARK AND IT 
IS A BIT OF A HANDFUL HE WILL BE 
CONCENTRATING ON HIS OWN GAME AND 
TRY AND GET INTO SOME KIND OF 
RHYTHM EVERY TIME YOU MISS AN EASY 
SHOT IT IS DE BILDE IT 
DEBILITATING SO PERHAPS THERE 
MIGHT HASN'T GOT UNDER WAY IT'S IT'S SUM UP THAT FRAME FOR US STEPHEN STEPHEN GOT A RED EARLY ON LOOKS LIKE HE 
HAS GOT HIMSELF INTO A NICE 
POSITION POTTED A FEW BALLS ADDED 
CANNOT REALLY BELIEVE THAT HE HAS 
MISSED THAT THIS IS JUST A LACK OF 
CONCENTRATION WHICH DOES HAPPEN A 
TO GET A WEE BIT OLDER IT WAS A 
VERY POOR MISS FROM STEPHEN AND 
THEN YOU'RE THINKING THAT'S YOU 
SITTING DOWN FOR A WHILE BUT THEN 
MARK ALLEN ALSO MISSED THE AWFUL 
ONE AFTERWARDS 
WOULD YOU THINK OF 
THEIR HEAD TO 
I CANNOT COMMENT L. L. 
USED TO HAVE RED HAIR AND I'M DOWN 
TO THIS LATER NOW L. THINK THE JURY 
IS OUT 
I QUITE LIKE IT BACK 
BACK TO THE MATCH 
STEVE DAVIS'S HARE WAS 
NEVER THAT OF THAT COLOUR 
NOW THIS IS THE TYPE OF SHOD THAT 
IS GOING TO TELL THE STORY OF THIS 
MATCH 
STEPHEN HENDRY'S LONG PUTTING HAS 
BEEN LETTING HIMSELF DOWN OF LATE 
IT IS THE TYPE OF SHOT BUT HE 
PRACTICES HOUR AFTER HOUR 
IT WAS CLOSE BUT HE DIDN'T HOLD 
BACK 
I KNOW IT IS EARLY BUT IS THERE A 
CHANCE HERE HE COULD POT THE BLUE 
CANNON INTO THE PINK 
HE STUCK ON IT I THINK HE STILL 
HAS GOT ONE TO THE RIGHT CORNER HE 
IS JUST HAVING A LOOK ROUND TO SEE 
IF HE CAN GET ONTO THE BLACK JUST 
WATCH THE RED RED COMES OVER IT 
NEARLY COVERS THE BLACK 
HE FELT THAT WAS A BIT TOO RISKY 
AND I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR THAT HE 
CAN ALWAYS GET BACK TO THE BLACK IN 
A FEW SHOTS 
I SUPPOSE WHEN HE'S PICKED THEM HE 
WAS UNLUCKY FOR THE PINK TO GO SAFE 
WHEN HE SPLIT THEM 
FUNNILY ENOUGH IT WAS PETER EBDON 
THAT FIRST BROUGHT MARK TO MY 
ATTENTION 
HE SAID IT WOULDN'T TAKE HIM AS 
LONG AS IT TOOK DIN JUNHUI TO WIN 
TITLE EVENT PETER WAS SLIGHTLY 
WRONG BUT HE DOES HAVE TREMENDOUS 
ABILITY THIS MAN AS YOU SAY 
DENNIS HE DOESN'T HANG ABOUT 
A LITTLE BIT STRAIGHTER ON THIS 
BLUE WOULD HAVE BEEN IDEAL 
HE COULD AND HE DID GET IT THREE 
REDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE 
WOULD BE ENOUGH 
VIRTUALLY FIVE MINUTES AND HE HAD 
CLINCHED THE FRAME A 
APPLAUSE THERE FROM THIS 
KNOWLEDGEABLE CRUCIBLE AUDIENCE HE WAS RIGHT TO NOT LISTEN THOUGH 
BARRING SNOOKERS THAT SHOULD BE 
ENOUGH 
HE SEEMED TO HIT THAT A LITTLE BIT 
TOO HARD 
IF STEPHEN HENDRY CAN GET A FEW 
REDS AND BLACKS HE'S NOT QUITE OUT 
OF THE FRAME 
YOUNG MARK ALAN HAS GOT A LOT OF 
SUPPORT FROM NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
ALL OVER THE U. K. 
HE PAID HIMSELF FOR ABOUT FORTY OF HIS 
FRIENDS THEIR TICKETS HERE ALWAYS 
A PACKED CRUCIBLE HE HAS A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUPPORT TWO SNOOKERS REQUIRED AT THE MOMENT 
THE PINK IS IN A GOOD SPOT FOR A 
SNOOKER IF YOU GET IN BEHIND IT 
AND THE RED AT THE OTHER END OF THE 
TABLE IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO 
ESCAPE FROM 
THAT HAS PUT THE PINK OUT OF 
COMMISSION THAT WASN'T A GOOD SHOT 
I DON'T THINK HE INTENDED TO MOVE 
THAT PINK 
HE KEPT PERFECTLY STILL ON THAT 
SHOT FOR 
THAT WAS AN EXHIBITION TYPE SHOT 
FOR YOU 
IT DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT THE PINK 
HE MADE SOME GOOD BALLS THERE AND 
HE LEVELS THE MATCH 
THERE WAS A 
VERY INTERESTING PART OF THAT FRAME 
WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THAT LONG 
POTTING WILL PLAY A BIG PART IN 
THIS MATCH 
HE COULD HAVE TRIED TO GET ON THE 
BLUE BUT HE FULLY COMMITTED TO THE 
SHOT AND THIS WAS THE RESULT IT IS 
THE TYPE OF SHOT HE PRACTISES A LOT 
BUT IF YOU DON'T PUT THE RED YOU 
SAID YOUR OPPONENT IN AND THAT 
COST HIM 
HE ALWAYS FULLY COMMITS JOHN BUT 
IT WAS COSTLY 
YES HE DID ADMIT IN 
THE INTERVIEW BEFORE THAT SOMETIMES 
HE PUSHES THE BOAT OUT A LITTLE BIT 
TOO MUCH L. AM NOT SAYING HE DID 
THEIR BUT IF YOU CAN LOOK ON A SHOT 
WHERE THE ONLY BALL YOU CAN LEAVE 
IS THE ONE YOU ARE PLAYING IT 
GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A RESPITE 
BUT THERE HE FULLY COMMITTED AND 
LEFT HIS OPPONENT WITH A CHOICE OF 
REDS 
AT THE MOMENT EVEN STEVENS ONE 
EACH 
WITH A BREAK OF SHOT YOU WERE 
TRYING TO GET THE WHITE TIGHT ON 
THE BAULK CUSHION BECAUSE THESE 
YOUNG PLAYERS ARE DEVASTATING LONG 
POTTERS YOU WHAT TRYING YOU 
ARE TRYING 
THE BREAK UP SHOT IS MORE IMPORTANT 
NOW THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN 
HE'S USING THE REST RIGHT HANDED 
AMAZING THAT HE IS LEFT HANDED 
TONY MAY ARE USED TO DO THAT A 
GREAT LEFT HANDED PLAYER 
IT LOOKS DOUBTFUL THAT HE CAN PLAY 
THE POSITION ON THE PINK THEN HE 
WILL HAVE TO SCREW BACK UP THE 
TABLE FOR A BAULK COLOUR 
THAT WAS EXCELLENT HE IS ON THE 
BUT SOMETIMES YOU WOULD THINK 
MAYBE THE YELLOW 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY A CANNON 
INTO THEM OFF THE YELLOW YOU COULD 
COME INTO THE SIDE OF THE CLUSTER HE WILL SETTLE FOR THAT 
THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THE RED NEAR 
THE BLACK SPOT 
HE HAS GOT QUITE A LIGHT GRIP JUST 
THE THUMB AND A COUPLE OF FINGERS 
HE DOES HAVE SUPERB CUE ACTION HE CAN FORGET ABOUT THE BLACK FOR A 
WHILE BECAUSE THE PINK IS PRETTY 
WELL PLACED AS YOU CAN SEE 
YOU CAN SEE HOW HE JUST GRIPS WITH 
THE THUMB JUST RESTING WITH A 
COUPLE OF FINGERS 
MILLIONS A SNOOKER PLAYERS AND NO 
TWO PLAYERS EVER LOOK THIS FRAME 
YOU WOULD RATHER HAVE LIGHT GRIP THAN A FIRM GRIP 
THAT IS WHEN THE SHOULDER GOES END 
YOU START HITTING ACROSS THE BALL 
THE YOU MEAN A LITTLE TWITCH YES 
HE'S LOOKING VERY POSITIVE IS THIS 
YOUNG MAN 
THE FACT HE HAD SUCH A GOOD RESULT 
AGAINST HIM IN THE U. K. THIS PLAY IS 
NOT FRIGHTENED OF ANYONE IN FACT IN 
THE GAME THIS PLAYER 
REALLY SINCE THAT LONG RED THAT 
STEPHEN HENDRY MISSED IN BETWEEN 
FRAMES IT HAS BEEN ALL MARK ALAN 
HE CAN SCREW BACK IF THE WHITE 
COMES BACK PAST WHERE IT IS NOW HE 
WOULD BE PERFECTLY ON THE PINK STILL A POSSIBLE SIXTY SEVEN 
IF HE MISSES THE PINK THIS IS 
INCH PERFECT THAT'S A BIT OF 
CLASS 
THE REFEREE JUST KEEPING A CLOSE 
EYE THAT HE DIDN'T FOUL THE SHOT 
WITH HIS SLEEVE 
WE USED TO HAVE A WORD FOR THIS 
YEARS AGO IT IS LIKE SHELLING 
PEAS L. KNOW IT IS EARLY DOORS IN THIS MATCH 
STEPHEN HENDRY MUST BE GETTING A 
LITTLE WORRIED THAT GIVE HIM ONE 
CHANCE AND THIS YOUNG MAN WILL WIN 
THE FRAME 
A POSSIBLE CENTURY WAS ON BUT HE 
WON'T BOTHER ABOUT THAT HE HAD A 
MAGNIFICENT BREAK OF EIGHTY SEVEN TO CLINCH 
THE THIRD 
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE ENGINE LIN IN 
HIS CHEEKS HE IS UP FROM THAT 
FROM THE ADRENALINE IN HIS CHEEKS 
HE WENT ON TO BEAT KEN DOHERTY 
BEFORE AND IT WAS A SENSATIONAL 
VICTORY IN THIS CONTEXT STEPHEN 
HENDRY CAN'T AFFORD TO LET HIM 
START TO MOVE ON EARLY ON 
NO BUT 
SOMETIMES THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN 
DO LOOK AT THE WAY HE IS GOING 
AROUND THE TABLE HE IS A 
PRODIGIOUS TALENT STEPHEN HENDRY 
IS TRYING TO GET BACK TO FORM 
WORKING WITH HIS COAT ON ALL 
ASPECTS OF TECHNIQUE AND TRYING TO 
MAKE IT AS SOLID AS CAN BE THEN 
THE GUY COMES ON THE TABLE LOOKS 
SO CASUAL AND WITH AN UNORTHODOX 
CUE ACTION HIS GRIP IS NOT 
ORTHODOX BUT HE IS KNOCKING THE 
BALL SENT 
HE HAS THE BIGGEST WATCH 
YOU'VE EVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE ON 
HIS ARM IS VERY DANGEROUS HE IS A 
BOTTLE OF POP HE FIZZES FROM THE 
MINUTE HE COMES OUT AND HE IS 
DANGEROUS 
STEPHEN HENDRY KNEW HE WOULD BE IN 
FOR A TOUGH GAME AND IT IS 
CERTAINLY PROVING THAT WAY 
THERE IS AN EASY SAFETY SHOT ON 
DOWN THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE 
TABLE THERE IS A RED ON THE RIGHT 
HAND SIDE HE'S LOOKING TO SEE IF 
HE WOULD BE ON THE BLACK BUT IT IS 
TOUGH 
I WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO PLAY A 
LITTLE BIT MORE SAFETY 
YES HE GOT 
AWAY WITH THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS A 
RISKY POT THAT MARK ALLEN TRIED 
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD POT IT IS A 
LOT MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT LOOKED 
HE NEVER HOLDS BACK STEPHEN HENDRY 
THAT WAS NOT AN EASY POT BY ANY 
MEANS BUT IN IT WENT AND THIS IS 
THE NATURE OF THE GAME OF SNOOKER 
NOW IT IS UP TO STEPHEN UP TO PUT 
ON THE FRIGHTENERS HE CAN SAY TO 
HIS OPPONENT IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE 
I CAN WIN THE FRAME IN ONE VISIT 
IT IS THE SIGNALS AND MESSAGES YOU 
SEND OUT 
HE DIDN'T QUITE GET THE 
WHITE WHERE HE WANTED IT 
HE LOOKS TO BE CUEING WELL ENOUGH 
IT IS JUST THAT ONE LONG POT 
IT IS 
TOUGH IF THAT IS THE ONLY MISTAKE 
YOU MAKE HE HAS JUST NOT GOT THE 
PACE OF THE TABLE AT THE MOMENT 
HE NOT ONLY MISSED JUDGED THE PACE 
HE MISJUDGED THE LINE OF IT 
MISSED JUDGED 
ONCE AGAIN THAT BUILDS UP THE 
FRUSTRATION THAT YOU HAD A GOOD 
CHANCE AND YOU HAVE NOT MADE THE 
MOST OF IT 
IT IS FAR FROM EASY THAT IS WHY HE 
IS HAVING TO THINK ABOUT IT 
WHEN YOU ARE IN THIS TYPE OF 
SITUATION YOU WERE ALWAYS LOOKING 
FOR A RED NEAR A CUSHION YOU ARE 
ALWAYS 
IF HE NESTLES ON THE THREE REDS 
THERE IN THE CIRCLE IF HE DIDN'T 
GET THAT RIGHT HE WOULD STILL 
LEAVE RED ON SO IT IS A TOUGH 
SITUATION HE KEEPS LOOKING AT THE 
RED AND THE LEFT SIDE CAN HE GET 
BETWEEN THE GREEN AND BROWN 
I THINK HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH THIS 
WHAT A RESULT HE HAS HAD THERE 
WHAT A RESULT THAT IS JOHN 
I FEEL 
HE DIDN'T PLAY TO HIT THE RED 
I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT HE 
PLAYED THE TWO CUSHION ESCAPE WITH 
A LOT OF SWERVE SO IT WAS WELL 
THOUGHT OUT SHOT ANTTI NIEMI PAUL 
DICKOV ANTTI NIEMI LEAGUE PULLED 
IT OFF AND HE VERY NEARLY PULLED 
IT OFF 
TOUGH SHOTS THOSE IS THERE A GAP 
BETWEEN THE TWO REDS IF NOT THAT 
IS ONE EACH 
YOU CAN'T GO TO THE BAULK END FOR 
SAFETY YOU CAN'T PERMIT TO THE TOP 
CUSHION DIFFICULT ONE THIS YOU 
CAN'T BRING IT 
HE HAS REFUSED A POT YOU DON'T SEE 
THAT VERY OFTEN A LITTLE BIT OF A 
STALEMATE AT THE MOMENT 
AS MARK AND IT WAS COMING AWAY FROM 
THE TABLE HE TRIED TO CATCH 
STEPHEN'S BY AND I DON'T KNOW IF 
HE IS TOO BOTHERED ABOUT PLAYING 
THIS SORT OF STUFF L. THINK THEY 
JUST HAVE TO CATCH EACH OTHER'S EYE 
HERE WE MY HAT MIGHT HAVE A RE 
RIGHT 
THEY HAVE A LOT THEY HAVE CAUGHT EACH OTHER'S EYE 
AND IT IS RE RACK YOU DON'T WANT 
TO GET CAUGHT OUT IN THAT SORT OF 
TACTICAL BATTLE 
WITH A BIT OF 
EXPERIENCE MAYBE IT WAS A CASE 
THAT HE COULD HAVE SLOWED MARK ALAN 
DOWN THERE AND IT KNOCKED HIM OUT 
OF HIS RHYTHM HE COULD HAVE GOT 
QUITE RESOLVED QUITE EASILY 
MICHAELA TABB THE REFEREE HERE FOR 
THE MATCH REPLACING THE BALLS 
WELL ESTABLISHED NOW ON THE SNOOKER 
CIRCUIT AS ONE OF THE BEST REFEREES 
NEXT VERY FEW MISTAKES MAKES 
VERY FEW MISTAKES 
THEY ARE ALL RIGHT THOSE SHOTS IF 
YOU DO NOT GET CLOSE TO THE POCKET 
THIS IS A RISKY ONE IF HE IS 
TAKING THIS ONE ON IT REALLY IS 
I'M NOT QUITE SURE ABOUT THAT 
CHOICE THAT WAS A VERY TOUGH SHOT 
IF HE DOUBLE KISS TOOK THE RED AND 
PRESSURE GET ON IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
AN EASY STARTER FOR STEPHEN BUT HE 
STILL LEFT A CHANCE 
THIS THE LAST FRAME BEFORE THE 
MID SESSION INTERVAL 
IT MAY BE AN OBVIOUS THING TO SAY 
BUT IF HE'S GOING TO GET ANYTHING 
OUT OF THIS MATCH HE NEEDS TO 
SCORE HEAVILY HIS OPPONENT WILL 
THAT IS A BIT UCKY HE HAD THE 
EASY RED TO PLAY FOR BUT HE 
THAT WOULD ALWAYS BE ON FOR THE 
RIGHT CORNER HE DID NOT ENVISAGE 
THE WHITE ARCING LIKE IT DID AND 
FINISHING RIGHT AMONGST THE REDS 
THERE JUST WATCH THAT THE WHITE 
HERE IT SPINS INTO AN AWKWARD SPOT 
I THOUGHT WHEN STEPHEN PLAYED THAT 
I THOUGHT HE HAS GIVEN HIM HALF A 
CHANCE THE TIME BEFORE HE WAS AT 
THE TABLE MARK ALAN HE PLAYED A 
DIFFICULT RED OFF THE CUSHION YOU 
JUST GET THE FEELING HE IS NOT 
GOING TO REFUSE ANYTHING THAT IS 
POSSIBLE 
THIS IS A TERRIFIC POT POSSIBLE HERE IT REALLY WAS 
AS YOU MENTIONED THIS IS THE FRAME 
BEFORE THE MID SESSION INTERVAL 
WE HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN PLAYING FORTY FIVE 
MINUTES 
IN FACT TALKING ABOUT THE LENGTH 
OF FRAMES CLIFF THORBURN'S OLD 
WORLD RECORD WITH STEPHEN O'CONNOR 
IN CHINA SHAUN MURPHY PLAYING DAVE 
HAROLD THEY PAID SOMETHING LIKE NINETY THREE 
MINUTES PLAYED SOMETHING LIKE NINETY THREE 
MINUTES LOOK AT THE SHORT TIME FIFTEEN SECONDS 
SIXTEEN I AM MAKING HIM QUICKER THEN HE 
IS HE IS ONE OF THOSE PLAYERS AND 
WE HAVE SEEN IT THROUGHOUT THE 
YEARS WITH THESE QUICK FIRE 
POTTERS THAT ALL OF SUDDEN FROM 
NOWHERE THEY ARE RUN A FRAME 
WINNING SITUATION IN FRAME WINNING SITUATION 
UNFORTUNATELY FOR STEPHEN AND HIS 
SUPPORTERS HE HAS TO SIT AND WATCH 
I WONDER WHY IT IS THAT ALL THE 
LEFT HANDED PLAYERS THEY SEEM TO 
BE THE BEST PARTIES IN THE WORLD 
BUT NEIL ROBERTSON JIMMY WHITE 
MARK WILLIAMS THE BEST POTTERS 
BUT THERE HAS ONLY BEEN ONE LEFT 
HANDED 
WORLD CHAMPION 
AND THAT WAS 
MARK WILLIAMS 
JUST HAVING A QUICK GLANCE AT THE 
SCOREBOARD 
REDS AVAILABLE 
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DISTURBING 
ANYTHING 
PLAYING ONE OF THE LEGENDS OF THE 
GAME AT THE CRUCIBLE CAN ALWAYS 
BE A BIT DAUNTING IT DOESN'T 
APPEAR TO BE AT THE MOMENT FOR MARK 
ALLEN IT LOOKS AS THOUGH HE IS IN 
HIS SNOOKER CLUB JUST WALKING 
AROUND LOOKING THE BALLS IN CLEAN 
AS WHISTLE KNOCKING THE BALLS IN 
TWO REDS TWO COLOURS WOULD BE 
ENOUGH 
JUST MAYBE STEPHEN HENDRY IS 
THINKING MAYBE HE SHOULD NOT HAVE 
HAD THE RACK SO QUICKLY TO READ 
RACK BUT YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING 
ABOUT THIS 
THIS YOUNG MAN IS MISSING VERY 
LITTLE 
HE MADE TWO CENTURIES AT THE 
CRUCIBLE THIS COULD BE A POSSIBLE 
THIRD A BIT OF WORK TO DO BUT HE 
HAS MADE FORTY ONE CENTURIES IN HIS VERY 
SHORT CAREER HIS THIRD YEAR AS A 
PRO 
HE WILL HAVE TO TAKE THE BROWN NOW 
ALL THE YELLOW TO GET ON THAT RED 
OR THE YELLOW 
THE ONLY THING HE HASN'T GOT IS A 
CENTURY BREAK HE HAS SHOWN US 
EVERYTHING ELSE 
WHAT A PITY BUT WHAT A PERFORMANCE 
LOST THE FIRST FRAME BUT NOW 
STEPHEN HENDRY IS IN A BIT OF 
BOTHER 
TALK ABOUT MOMENTUM FIFTEEN SECONDS A 
SHOT THIS FELLOW CAN PLAY 
HE CAN 
HE IS A BIT OF A HANDFUL FROM 
STEPHEN HENDRY'S PERSPECTIVE IT IS 
SLIGHTLY WORRYING THE PLAYERS ARE 
PLAYING A TRICK OF FORM AT THE 
MOMENT BREAK BUILDING STAT MARK 
ALLEN HAS BEEN OUTSCORING STEPHEN 
HENDRY THE WAY IT HAS GONE IS 
ACTUALLY A REFLECTION OF HOW THEY 
ARE PLAYING ON CURRENT FORM THE 
PROBLEM FOR STEPHEN HENDRY IS TOO 
SLOW A PLAYER LIKE MARK ALLEN DOWN 
YOU HAVE TO KEEP HIM OFF THE TABLE 
THAT SEEMS TO HAVE DRIED UP 
STEPHEN HENDRY IS NOT DOING WHAT HE 
USED TO DO HOW DO YOU GET BACK TO 
THAT I DO NOT KNOW HE WAS UNLUCKY 
WHEN HE GOT INTO THE PACK BUT 
GENERALLY HE HAS HAD CHANCES BUT 
NOT CLINCHED THE FRAME AT TOP 
VISITS POT PLANTS THEY GO THIS 
CAN MAKE OR BREAK A PLAYER STEPHEN STEPHEN IS BEING FORCED TO TAKE A DIFFICULT 
LONG SHOTS TO GET INTO THE FRAME IN 
THE FIRST PLACE AND IF HE MISSES 
HE IS READY TO POUNCE 
IT PUTS 
PRESSURE ON ALL PARTS OF YOUR GAME 
THE SAME WAY IN THE GOLFING WORLD 
A THEN FOR A SNOOKER PLAYER YOU 
WHAT OUT THINKING YOURSELF YOU ARE 
THINKING YOU MUST GET THIS TO 
KEEP THE HEAT ON YOUR OPPONENT 
MARK AND IT IS FLYING AROUND THE 
TABLE NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD 
MARK ALLEN STEPHEN HENDRY IS GOING 
THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES IN HIS 
CAREER HE IS NOT OUT OF IT BY ANY 
MEANS HE HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF 
METHOD BUT IT MAY BE A STRUGGLE 
FROM NOW ON 
THANKS YOU FOR MANY OF 
THE MOULD THE FIRST ONE IS FROM 
GARETH STEVE HOW MANY HOURS T. 
PRACTICE COMPARED TO WHEN YOU WON 
EVERYTHING AND HIS HIS PREPARATION 
DIFFERENT COMMIT TO THIS YEAR'S 
CHAMPIONSHIP AND IT WAS IN THE 
EIGHTIES 
MY GENERAL PREPARATION EIGHTIES REFLECT THE SITUATION I AM IN THE 
GAME IT WOULD BE SILLY FOR ME TO 
GIVE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OFF MY GAME JUST 
LIFE TO SNOOKER WHEN I'M NOT 
COULD BE WINNING TOURNAMENTS L. TRY 
TO ENJOY MYSELF WARNED THE PRACTICE 
TABLE I HAVE BEEN PRACTISING QUITE 
A BIT FOR THIS ONE I HAVE GOT THE 
BIT BETWEEN MY TEETH PUTTING IN 
FIVE HOURS A DAY AT HOME FOR THE 
LAST WEEK AND A HALF AND ENJOYING 
THE PRACTICE IT HAS NOT BEEN HARD 
FOR ME BUT MY GENERAL PRACTICE I 
WOULD NOT BE ANYWHERE NEAR AS 
INTENSE NOW PERHAPS IT IS LUCKY 
SELF PRESERVATION POT IF I'M NOT 
SO INTENSE IT DOESN'T HURT SO MUCH 
WHEN YOU LOSE L. KNOW WHY I'VE GOT 
A CHANCE BUT I'M NOT PREPARED TO 
BE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SO I GO BACK TO MY 
ROOM WITH A BIT OF ROPE 
YOU HAVE 
TO COME HERE 
GENERALLY THE 
SITUATION IN MOCKERY I HAVE GOT TO 
ENJOY IT L. ENJOYED BY STILL BEING LIGHTER 
HE IS SAYING HE'S NOT LIGHTER TAKING IT TOO SERIOUSLY BUT TO THE 
EXTENT EVEN THAT HE WAS TELLING THE 
EARLY ON THAT HE HAS BEEN GETTING 
UP EARLY IN PREPARATION FOR MATCHES 
BECAUSE THE FIRST SESSION IS AT 
TEN A M. YOU HAVE BEEN PAPERING YOUR 
DAY TO PEAK AT TEN A M. I AM MOST 
IMPRESSED 
STICKER PLAYERS ARE IMPRESSED MAINLY VAMPIRES SO WE HAVE TO TURN 
OUR BODY CLOCK AROUND A SNOOKER 
PLAYERS 
THE SECOND ONE SAYS YOU PLAYERS MENTIONED EIGHT PLAYERS TO LOOK OUT 
FOR HIM THERE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
I WOULD KUDOS CUE IF YOU THINK 
STEPHEN HENDRY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN 
THAT LIST OF EIGHT EVERYONE THINKS 
HE CAN WIN IN EIGHT WORLD CROWN DO 
YOU AGREE 
I THINK THAT AIDS IS NOT 
BEYOND HIM IT IS A TOUGH ONE TO 
CALL I THINK AND EIGHTH HOW CAN 
YOU DISCOUNTS A SEVEN TIMES WORLD 
CHAMPION SOME TIME SOMEHOW HE 
HAS TO REGENERATE HIMSELF WHEN HE 
GETS OVER TRYING TOO HARD HE MIGHT 
BE A BETTER PLAYER AS HE EASES UP 
BUT IT IS TOUGH AT THE MOMENT L. 
DON'T WANT TO UPSET HIM BUT 
PERHAPS NOT AT THE MOMENT 
I DON'T 
THINK HE'S LISTENING IN HIS 
DRESSING ROOM AT THE CRUCIBLE AS 
YOU WELL KNOW WE ALWAYS GET SOME 
LATE NIGHT ON DAY ONE IT WAS NO 
EXCEPTION IT WASN'T TOO BAD IT 
WOULD ONLY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY P. AND WON THE LAST 
BALL WAS POTTED THERE IS NO OLD 
PALS ACT BETWEEN THESE TWO IT WAS 
CARTER HAVING BEEN THREE TO ZERO DOWN 
RATTLED OFF SIX FRAMES IN A ROW WE 
SAW THE WALK OUT A BIT EARLIER WE 
ARE GOING TO PICK THEM UP IN THE 
OPENING FRAME OF THE AFTERNOON 
THE KISS ON THE PINK STEERED THE 
CUE BALL INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE 
TABLE BUT NEXT SHOT BUT ONE THE 
BIG PROBLEM COMES UP THE YELLOW 
I DON'T THINK HE HAS GOT A SHOT TO 
GET IN BEHIND THE YELLOW IT COULD 
BE THAT HE JUST DECIDES TO PLAY 
SAFETY SHOT ON THE YELLOW GETTING 
THE CUE BALL ROUGHLY BACK TO WHERE 
IT IS NOW WHICH MEANS THAT HE 
COULD PLAY GOOD SAFETY SHOT 
PROBABLY GET THE ADVANTAGE IN THE 
FRAME NOW ALL THE BALLS WILL BE ON 
BECAUSE YELLOW WILL BE IN OPEN PLAY 
I THINK THAT IS ALL HE IS THINKING 
ABOUT I DON'T BELIEVE HE HAS EVEN 
THOUGHT ABOUT THE DOUBLE 
AT WHAT POINT ONE IN THIS GAME 
HAWKINS WAS FORTY FIVE BEHIND NOW HE ONLY 
TRAILS BY TEN 
FIRST FRAME OF THE SESSION OFTEN 
SET ITS TONE AND THIS ONE I THINK 
IS ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE 
IT HAS THE POTENTIAL EITHER FOR 
QUITE A TO EXTEND HIS LEAD 
CARTER TO EXTEND HIS LEAD ALL FOUR 
OR HAWKINS TO START A COUNTER 
ATTACK 
SAVED BY THE PINK IT WOULD APPEAR 
AT FIRST GLANCE 
HE COULD GET TO 
THAT I WOULDN'T THINK CANNOT 
GET TO THAT 
DECENT SHOT ALTHOUGH JUST 
WONDERING WHETHER ALI CARTER MIGHT 
FANCY THIS THE GREEN IS A 
PAMPERING HIM AT ALL HE MIGHT TAKE 
HIM ON 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FRAME WINNER 
IN ALL PROBABILITY IF HE HAD GOT 
IT NEXT BEST THING FROM HIS POINT 
OF VIEW IT HAS RUN SAFE 
I THINK HAWKINS IT MAY BELIEVE THAT 
IF HE JAWED THAT AT YELLOW IT MAY 
RUN OFF TO THE CUSHION BUT IT 
HASN'T 
WELL DIRECTED CUE BALL THAT WAS 
GOING TO BE A GOOD SHOT BEFORE THE 
YELLOW HIT THE PINK 
I'M SURE THAT IF CARTER CAN WIN 
THIS FRAME WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN 
IN PROGRESS THIRTY TWO MINUTES HE WILL GET 
A NEW SURGE OF CONFIDENCE HAVING 
GONE AT SEVEN TO THREE UP AND HE MIGHT WIN 
QUITE EASILY BUT IF HE DOESN'T WIN 
IT THAT WILL GIVE HAWKINS THE 
ENCOURAGEMENT HE NEEDS 
MEANWHILE HAWKINS IS LEFT IN A 
SNOOKER 
HE HAS TO GET THE YELLOW SAFE 
SOMEHOW 
FREE BALL THE NON OFFENDER CANNOT 
HIT BOTH EDGES OF THE BALL ON 
CARTER THEREFORE ABLE TO NOMINATE 
GREEN AS HIS EXTRA YELLOW 
MADE AGE 
HUGE DIFFERENCE NO WAY THERE WAS A 
FREE BALL IN THIS A BIG TURNING 
POINT IN THE FRAME 
IT IS O. K. THIS HE HAS GOT THE 
ANGLE AT LEAST THE POT IS SLIGHTLY 
MORE DIFFICULT THAN HE WOULD HAVE 
WANTED BUT CERTAINLY HE WILL TAKE 
THE CUE BALL UP TO THE GREEN IF 
NOTHING ELSE 
YELLOW GREEN AND 
BROWN NEEDED 
THAT IS RIGHT IN BETWEEN SHOTS 
HE'S ON THE GREEN TO THE TOP LEFT 
A COUPLE OF INCHES FURTHER ON HE'S 
ON IT INTO THE MIDDLE REALLY IS 
SMACK IN BETWEEN 
HE IS PLAYING THE CUTBACK A GOOD 
SHOT IF HE IS ON THE BROWN IT IS 
EXCELLENT HE IS COMING VERY CLOSE 
TO IT THE FRAME IS NOT OVER 
UNLUCKY HAWKINS VERY RELIEVED 
THAT WAS A GOOD EFFORT FROM ALI 
CARTER 
HE CAN GET VERY THIN OFFICE CARTER BROWN AND KEEP THE ADVANTAGE IN 
THIS FRAME OFF THIS BROWN 
HE HAS GONE TO PUSH IT TOWARDS THE 
CUSHION WHICH PROBABLY WAS NOT A 
BAD SHOT IN THE END 
CARTER FAVOURITE TO GO SEVEN TO THREE UP 
HAWKINS CAN STILL REDUCE HIS 
ARREARS TO SIX TO FOUR EIGHTY CAN POT THE LAST 
FOUR COLOURS IF HE CAN POT THE 
LAST FOUR COLOURS INTENDING TO USE PINK AS A STOPPER 
AND THE SAFETY SHOT IS NOT EASY NOW 
YOU HAVE GOT ENOUGH BALLS IN THE 
WAY PINK AND BLACK AWKWARD THE 
DOUBLE KISS ON THE BROWN IS ALSO ON 
SO NOT AN EASY SHOT 
WHAT A THUNDEROUS KICK TOOK THE 
SPEED OUT OF THE BROWN TOOK THE 
SPEED OUT OF THE CUE BALL VERY 
EASY FRAME BALL FRAME BALL SHORT FOR CARTER 
WHAT A SICKENER FOR HAWKINS THERE 
DESPERATE THAT WAS HOW CAN YOU 
GET A KICK LIKE THAT THAT STOPS THE 
BROWN IN ITS TRACKS THAT IS 
DESPERATE LUCK 
A THIRTY EIGHT MID FRAME WITH SOME GOOD 
TACTICAL PLAY IN IT THE OUTCOME IS 
DETERMINED BY PIECE OF EXTREMELY BAD LUCK FOR ORGANS HAWKINS 
IN FRAME ELEVEN HAWKINS 
WAS UP AND CARTER VERY STRANGELY 
CONCEDED THIS FRAME WITH ENOUGH 
POINTS ON THE TABLE TO ACTUALLY WIN 
IT YOU CAN SEE HIM LOOKING AT THE 
SCORES WHAT D. YOU THINK HAPPENS 
HERE 
I DON'T KNOW HE WAS THIRTY FOUR HERE POINTS BEHIND L. DON'T KNOW WHAT 
COLOUR HE NOMINATED L. THINK HE 
PROBABLY NOMINATED BLUE L. ASSUME 
HE HAS NOMINATED BLUE COMMENDED THE 
MISS IS THAT HE IS THEN A THIRTY NINE 
POINTS BEHIND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE 
GIVES UP HE WAS ONLY THIRTY NINE POINTS 
BEHIND AS A RESULT OF THAT OUR 
CURRENT RULES HOWEVER STUPID YOU 
THINK THEY ARE THE PLAYER WILL GET 
WARNED AND THERE IS A POSSIBILITY 
THAT IF HE DOES IT AGAIN GIVING UP 
A FRAME WHEN THERE IS ENOUGH POINTS 
TO WIN YOU CAN GET DOCKED A FRENCH 
THE RULE WAS INTRODUCED TO STOP 
PEOPLE GIVING UP FRAMES AFTER A 
COUPLE OF BALLS BUT IN A SITUATION 
WHEN A GUY HAS A MISS COUNTED A A ACTUALLY MEANT THAT THE GUY HAS 
CONCEDED ANOTHER ONE AS WELL HE 
HAS LOST THE NEXT ONE ALL IN ALL 
IT IS NOT GOING FANTASTICALLY WELL 
OVER THE LAST FEW MINUTES FOR ALI 
CARTER THEY ARE GOING TO PLAY TO A 
FINISH FIRST TO TEN WILL GO THROUGH 
NOW WHERE IS JOHN PARROTT L. THINK HE HAS GONE PARTY ON US 
YES WITH A RENOWNED ARTIST TOM 
WALKER WHY HAVE YOU CHOSEN 
SNOOKER 
SNOOKER IS ONE OF MY SNOOKER OBSESSIONS IF I GET OBSESSED BY 
SOMETHING I PLAYED BADLY BUT I 
LOVE WATCHING IT AND IF I GET 
OBSESSED WITH SOMETHING I LIKE TO 
CONVERTED INTO PICTURES YOU MIGHT 
SAY CONVERT IT THIS IS A 
COMBINATION OF AN OBSESSION WITH 
IMAGE MAKING AND AN OBSESSION WITH 
SNOOKER 
WHERE DOES YOUR SNOOKER INSPIRATION COME FROM 
PARTLY FROM 
THE GAME OF COURSE AND THE BALLS 
AND THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BALLS ON 
THE TABLE AND WHAT YOU CAN 
SUPPLEMENT THE BALLS WITH WHICH IS 
ENDLESS AND THEN ALL SORTS OF 
LITTLE BITS OF WELL MEANING ANARCHY 
IN THERE 
YOU WERE DOING SOMETHING 
FOR US YOU HAVE MADE A START ON 
THIS WE WILL BE COMING BACK TO YOU 
OVER THE SEVENTEEN DAYS CAN YOU GIVE US 
THE GUIDELINES AS TO WHAT IS GOING 
ON 
I KNOW IT IS SMALL BUT THIS IS ON THE BEGINNING OF A SEVEN PART EPIC 
INCLUDING A KIND OF ANARCHIC 
HISTORY OF SNOOKER AND BALL GAMES 
AND BALLS AND ANARCHIC HISTORY AT 
SHEFFIELD ANYBODY WHO IS 
INTERESTED IN FACTS SHOULD NOT 
WATCHED THIS PICTURE PROGRESSING 
BUT IT IS ALL SORTS OF HIDDEN 
THINGS GOING ON WHICH WILL BE 
REVEALED IN DUE COURSE HOWEVER 
STAGE ONE THIS IS THE BIG BANG L. 
KNOW IT IS VERY LITTLE BUT IT IS 
MORE LIKE A SOFT CLICK IF YOU LIKE 
THIS IS THE BIG BANG THE BIRTH OF 
EVERYTHING OUT OF THIS BLACK HOLE 
WHAT EMERGES OF COURSE IS THE 
SPECTRUM COLOURS AND THE SPECTRUM 
COLOURS WHICH SHE KEN LOOSELY 
CORRELATE TO SNOOKER COLOURS THEY 
MAKE QUITE WHICH YOU CAN LOOSELY 
CORRELATE 
O. K. TOM WE WILL BE CORRELATE COMING BACK EVERY DAY TO LOOK HOW 
IT IS COMING ALONG BUT AM I RIGHT 
IN THINKING THAT STEVE DAVIS BOUGHT 
THREE PAINTINGS 
HE DID 
YOU WANT 
UNIQUE BECAUSE THAT RUMOUR IS THAT 
THE FOURTH INDIANA JONES FILM IS 
THE QUEST FOR STEVE DAVIS'S WALLET 
SO YOU DID VERY WELL 
IT COULD WELL BE WE WILL BE BACK 
TO SEE TOM'S PICTURES OVER THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS LET'S GET BACK INTO THE 
MATCH WE HAVE BEEN ENJOYING BETWEEN 
STEPHEN HENDRY AND MARK ALLEN A 
LITTLE MORE INFORMATION REQUIRED ON 
MARK ALLEN PLEASE 
I SHOULD BE BIT MORE USED TO THE 
VENUE THAN I WAS LAST YEAR WILL 
BE NERVOUS BUT ALL THE PLAYERS WILL 
BE IT IS WHAT YOU DREAM OF 
PLAYING SOMEONE LIKE STEPHEN IN AN 
ARENA LIKE THE CRUCIBLE BUT I AM 
THERE TO DO A JOB SO WELL WILL TRY 
MY BEST LASTED DEFINITELY HELPED 
OBVIOUSLY TO BEAT SOMEONE OF KEN'S 
STATURE IT PROVED TO MYSELF WHAT I 
WAS CAPABLE OF UP UNTIL THEN I 
HAVEN'T DONE MUCH AGAINST THE TOP 
PLAYERS AND I WAS WINNING MATCHES 
HE RAN THERE TO KEEP MY RANKINGS 
POSITIONS AND I WASN'T DOING 
ANYTHING SPECIAL HERE AND THERE 
THAT GAVE ME CONFIDENCE TO DO WHAT 
I HAVE DONE TO GET INTO THE SIXTEEN IT 
HAS DEFINITELY GIVEN ME THE 
CONFIDENCE OBVIOUSLY THE MAIN 
NICKNAME IS THE WORLD TOURNAMENT 
WHICH I HAVEN'T DONE BUT I HAVE TO 
BE A REALISTIC HOPEFULLY I WILL 
HAVE NUMBER OF YEARS LEFT IN THE 
SPORT IF I CAN SECURE MY TOP SIXTEEN 
PLACE IN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
BUT FOR THE NEXT TEE I CAN RELAX A 
BIT MORE WITH MY PARTNER BEING 
SNOOKER ORIENTATED HERSELF SHE 
KNOWS THE UPS AND DOWNS OF WINNING 
AND LOSING LIKE HAVING SOMEONE 
THAT I KNOW PRETTY WELL WITH ME AT 
THE TOURNAMENT I DON'T REVEAL LIKE 
BEING ON MY OWN IT GETS A VERY 
LONELY PLACE I HAVE BEEN 
TRAVELLING THE WORLD SINCE I WAS FOURTEEN 
AND HAVEN'T SEEN AS MUCH A FAMILY 
AND FRIENDS AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED 
COP SO ANY CHANCE YOU GET TO GET 
YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS WITH YOU IT IS 
JUST A BONUS REALLY 
THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE SUPPORTING ME L. HAVE BOOKED 
A LOT OF TICKETS FOR FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS TRAVELLING FROM NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND I HAVE MORE FRIENDS 
TRAVELLING FROM THE MIDLANDS WHICH 
IS WHERE I AM BASED WHENEVER I AM 
IN ENGLAND SO I THINK THAT WILL 
HELP RELAXED ME WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
STEPHEN'S RECORD YOU CAN'T COUNT 
HIM OUT OF ANYTHING HIS RESULTS 
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS MAYBE 
HAVEN'T BEEN WHAT HE EXPECTS BUT 
HE'S STILL MORE THAN CAPABLE OF 
BEATING ANY PLAYER ON ANY GIVEN DAY 
I KNOW IT WILL BE TOUGH FOR ME BUT 
I WAS IN THE U. K. CHAMPIONSHIPS IN 
NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER SO THAT 
DEFINITELY GAVE ME THE CONFIDENCE 
BUT IT WILL STILL BE A TOUGH MATCH 
STEPHEN AND MARK ARE COMING BACK IN 
THERE WAS BIG CHEER HIS FAMILY 
IS HERE HIS PARTNER WHO HAPPENS 
TO BE THE WOMEN'S SNOOKER WORLD 
CHAMPION THEIR DAUGHTER LAUREN 
IS HERE TOO DON'T KNOW IF SHE 
HAS LIFTED A CUE YET BUT I DON'T 
THINK IT WILL BE TOO LONG AND DAD 
IS DOING ALL RIGHT 
THAT WAS A VERY NICE INTERVIEW WITH 
MARK ALLEN HE HAS HIS FEET FIRMLY 
ON THE GROUND HE HAS SHOWN A 
TERRIFIC AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR 
STEPHEN HENDRY STEPHEN IS RENOWNED AS THE GREATEST 
PLAYER THAT HAS EVER PICKED 
SNOOKER CUE UP 
YES AND HE WENT 
STRAIGHT TO THE PRACTICE TABLE DID 
STEPHEN L. DON'T KNOW HOW LONG HE WAS ON IT FOR 
HE WAS SAT IN HIS DRESSING ROOM AND 
TO COME AND KNOCK ONE LIKE THAT IN 
WHAT START 
THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD SAFETY SHOT 
BLOCKED ALL THE OTHER NEWS OFF DOWN 
THE TABLE THE AVENUES 
HE WILL GET ANOTHER GO AT THAT I 
THINK 
IF THERE HAD TO HAVE BEEN AN EASY 
SAFETY SHOT FOR HIM HE PROBABLY 
WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THEM REPLACED 
BUT IT WAS AWKWARD IF THERE HAD 
HAVE BEEN 
ALTHOUGH HE DOESN'T WANT TO SLIP 
PAST THE RED STEPHEN IS POINTING 
UP THE CHALK MARK ON THE CUSHION 
POINTING OUT HE HAS HIT IT AGAIN A FEW MORE BALLS MOVED THIS TIME 
HIGHLY UNLIKELY STEPHEN WOULD LEAVE 
A RED 
I HAVE TO WARN YOU IF 
YOU DON'T HIT THE BALL YOU WILL 
LOSE IT 
THE REASON HE DID NOT WANT TO DO 
THAT IT JUST MAKES IT EASY FOR 
MARK TO PLAY ANOTHER SAFETY SHOT 
THIS TIME STEPHEN HAS A PATH BACK 
TO BAULK BUT HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL 
THAT WAS THE REASON HE DIDN'T PLAY 
IT BACK TO BAULK SAFETY HE WAS 
WORRIED ABOUT MAKING CONTACT WITH 
THAT RED IT IS ONLY CONTAINING 
SAFETY IT IS NOT PUTTING THE 
OPPONENT UNDER ANY UNDUE PRESSURE 
VERY WELL PLAYED HE HAS COVERED 
THE RED WITH THE YELLOW THAT IS 
WHY THE PACE IS VERY IMPORTANT HE 
JUDGED IT TO PERFECTION 
AND IT WAS 
SLIGHTLY TRICKY AND DANGEROUS BUT 
HE JUST DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THE 
DANGERS PRETTY GOOD 
THERE IS NO REAL VALUE IN TAKING 
THE POT ON TO THE RIGHT CORNER IF 
THE BLACK WAS AVAILABLE HE COULD 
PLAY IT AS A SHOT TO NOTHING 
HE REFUSES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THIS 
YOUNG MAN 
TERRIFIC POT YOU COULD SAY AT THE 
MOMENT HE'S CALLING ALL THE SHOTS 
THERE IS A RED THAT WILL GO THROUGH 
THE GAP NEAR THE PINK SPOT L. THINK THERE IS YES IT IS STILL NOT EASY 
THERE IS ONE THAT WILL GO TWO FROM 
THE BLACK THINK 
HE HAS GOT A LOVELY TOUCH WHEN HE'S 
IN AND AROUND THE REDS LIKE THIS 
YOU JUST GET THE FEELING HE'S GONNA 
MAKE THINGS HAPPEN WHEN HE COMES TO 
THE TABLE 
CARELESS ONE WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR 
HIM 
HE TOOK THE SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT 
POT FOR POSITIONAL PURPOSES 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS TO MAKE 
SOMETHING HAPPEN NOW JUST NOT HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT 
THAT IS A TERRIFIC RESULT HE 
PLAYED A POSITIVE SHOT HE HAD A 
LITTLE BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE TO LEAVE 
IT TO THE RIGHT CORNER BUT HE 
PLAYED THE RIGHT SHOT AND NOW HE 
HAS GIVEN HIMSELF A TERRIFIC 
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE FRAME 
IT IS USUALLY THE CASE WHEN YOU 
ARE PLAYING WELL YOU PLAY THAT 
SORT OF CANNON IT WORKS OUT FOR 
YOU WHEN YOU'RE STRUGGLING IT 
DOESN'T THAT WILL DO NICELY HE HE PLAYED THE RIGHT SHOT AND HE GOT 
THE REWARD 
I AM NOT QUITE CERTAIN WHERE THE 
NEXT RED COMES FROM BUT HE IS A 
VERY QUICK PLAYER ALTHOUGH HE'S 
NOT FRIGHTENED TO SLOW IT DOWN WHEN 
THINGS ARE NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD I'M 
SURE HE HAS LEARNT THAT WHEN IT IS 
NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD YOU CANNOT 
RUSH IN 
HE GOT AS LOW AS FIFTEEN SECONDS A SHORT 
TIME A SHORT TIME 
IS THERE A 
PLANT 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT IS ON IT WAS 
ON TO THE RIGHT HALF OF THE POCKET 
A LITTLE BIT HARDER AND THE POCKET 
PLAYING AT HAVE ACCEPTED THAT THE 
BALL MAY NOT HAVE ACCEPTED THAT 
PAUL BUT HE PLAYED IT PERFECT 
WEIGHT HAVING TO GRAFT FOR THESE 
POINTS BUT HE IS GETTING CLOSER 
AND CLOSER TO THE WINNING LINE IN 
THIS FRAME 
THAT COULD HAVE WORKED OUT BETTER 
I DON'T THINK HE'S ON ANYTHING A 
DANGEROUS THING TO SAY WITH 
POTTER LIKE THIS 
HOW DID HE NOT 
FINISH ON A RED HE HAS PLAYED THAT 
TO PERFECTION 
I THINK HE IS ENJOYING HIMSELF OUT 
THERE 
HE IS LOVING IT ABSOLUTELY THERE LOVING IT L. KNOW SOMEONE WHO ISN'T 
LOOKING FOR ONE MORE RED AND HE IS 
ON IT 
JUST LOOKING AT HIS BREAKS HE HAD 
A BREAK OF SEVENTY IN FRAME TWO HE HAD 
A BREAK OF NINETY ONE IN FRAME FOUR AND 
HE'S OFF AGAIN 
JUST THAT LITTLE TOUCH OF SIDE 
THERE LOOK WHERE IT HAS BROUGHT 
THE CUE BALL 
OF COURSE WE HAVE ANOTHER PLAYER 
FROM NORTHERN IRELAND INVOLVED THIS 
YEAR JOE SWAIL HE IS DOING VERY 
WELL 
BIT OF A CARELESS ONE THERE BUT 
STEPHEN HENDRY STAYS IN HIS SEAT 
ANOTHER TERRIFIC PERFORMANCE FROM 
MARK ALLEN THAT HAS SEALED THE 
FRAME FOR HIM HE IS GOING TO TAKE 
SOME STOPPING I THINK 
STEPHEN HENDRY COULD DO WITH 
GETTING INTO A SAFETY BATTLE FOR A 
WHILE IT SEEMS STRANGE THING TO SAY 
HE HAS GOT TO KEEP HIM OFF THE SAY TABLE AS WELL L. THINK THE KEY 
STATISTIC SO FAR IN THIS MATCH IS 
THE SAFETY EIGHTY SEVEN PER CENT IS NOT 
BAD BUT IT IS THE POT AS FOR 
STEPHEN HENDRY HE IS DOWN TO EIGHTY 
PER CENT AT THIS LEVEL IF YOU'RE 
NOT HOVERING AROUND NINETY PER CENT 
YOU'RE GIVING YOUR OPPONENT TOO 
MANY CHANCES HE HAS GOT IT ALL TO 
DO IT HERE THE SEVEN TIMES WORLD 
CHAMPION 
AS YOU CAN SEE MARK ALLEN NINETY TWO PER 
CENT THAT IS THE SORT OF FIGURE 
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 
HE DIDN'T WANT THE RED TO GO AS 
CLOSE TO THAT CORNER POCKET 
JUST LOOKING AT IT IF HE DOES TAKE 
THE POT ON HE COULD DO WITH 
HITTING THE BROWN TO STOP IT 
OTHERWISE IT MIGHT COME BACK UP THE 
TABLE AND HE WON'T BE ON ANYTHING 
THE BLACK WILL NOT GO THE PINK 
WILL NOT GO HE HAD TO POT THAT 
DEAD WEIGHT AND HE HAD A CHANCE OF 
FINISHING ON THE BLUE BUT BECAUSE 
HE HIT IT THIN HE IS NOT ON 
ANYTHING THE SAME SCENARIO FOR 
STEPHEN HENDRY HERE HE DIDN'T 
DECIDE TO HAVE GO AT THE POT BUT 
HE DID NOT GET CUE BALL HE WAS 
HOPING TO LEAVE IT NEAR THE CUSHION 
YOU CANNOT LEAVE THESE OUT FOR MARK 
ALLEN 
WELL HE IS HUMAN AFTER ALL LOOK 
AT THE SHOT HE HAS LEFT STEPHEN 
WITH 
WILL HE TAKE THIS LONG ONE ON I 
DON'T THINK SO 
THIS IS THE RIGHT TACTICS BUT HE 
HAS GOT TO GET SOME GOOD LONG 
SAFETY SHOTS IN 
IT IS NOT THE BEST OF SAFETY SHOTS 
HE HAS LEFT A POTS ON TO THE CORNER 
THIS HAS GOT TO GO WIN OTHERWISE 
HE WILL STICK STEPHEN UP GO IN 
NOT A PROBLEM FROM STRIKING WHERE 
THE CUE BALL IS STRIKING DOWN ON 
IT YOU HAVE GOT TO BE SO ACCURATE 
THAT IS A SURPRISE IT JUST SHOWS 
YOU WHEN YOU RULE ROLL THE BALL 
SLOW TRYING TO DROP THE BLUE IN TO 
STAY ON THIS RED IT CAN BE MISSED 
THE LONGER IT GOES THE HARDER IT 
IS GOING TO GET FOR STEPHEN HE IS 
BEING HELD SCORED HERE ALMOST 
THREE TO ONE OUTSCORED HERE YOU 
FEEL THAT HE IS LOOKING FOR AN EASY 
STARTER 
A SO POSED YOU COULD GO BACK TO THE 
BLUE THAT HE MISSED I SUPPOSE 
THIS COULD BE OUT OF POSITION HERE 
THIS MIGHT BE THE END OF BREAK 
HE IS O. K. ANOTHER GOOD CHANCE NOW HE CAN GET INTO THE REDS 
I WAS 
ASKING THE SAME QUESTION AS YOU 
DID HE HAVE THE ANGLE TO POT THE 
BLUE AND GO INTO THE BACK OF THE 
REDS HE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T BUT YOU 
WOULDN'T BET LONG ODDS ON HIM 
KNOCKING THIS RED IN SO CLOSE 
JUST TRYING TO HOLD FOR THE BLACK 
PROBABLY HOLD CAUSED HIM TO MISS 
THE POT 
IT HAS BEEN A TWENTY SIX MINUTES SINCE 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS POTTED A BALL 
HE WILL HAVE BEEN RELIEVED TO SEE 
THAT ONE GO IN AND THIS IS THE 
BEST CHANCE HE HAS HAD FOR QUITE 
SOME TIME LET'S SEE WHAT THE 
SEVEN TIMES FORMER WORLD CHAMPION 
CAN MAKE OF THIS 
I DON'T THINK THE BLACK WILL GO 
INTO THE LEFT CORNER 
IT IS O. K. AS LONG AS YOU GET A GOOD 
ANGLE ON THE BLUE AND THAT IS 
PERFECT HE HAS THREE REDS ON THE 
LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE ALL 
AVAILABLE SO HE DOES NOT HAVE TO 
PLAY A CANNON HE CAN JUST SCREW 
AND AVOID THE MAIN CLUSTER HERE 
HE DECIDED TO GO INTO THEM AND 
THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT COULD 
HAVE GONE WRONG I'M SURPRISED HE 
PLAYED IT BUT HE MUST BE ON 
SOMETHING 
THAT WAS THE BEST HE COULD DO WITH 
THE CUE BALL THERE 
HE HAS PLAYED THE CANNON SO THAT 
HAS HELPED HUNTER IS STOP THE WHITE 
HELPED HIM TO STOP THE WHITE ANOTHER CANNON REQUIRED HERE 
HE HAS GOT A CHOICE OF REDS HERE 
IF HE CAN DROP ON ONCE CIRCLED 
WHICH IS BLOCKING THE BLACK HE HAS 
GOT A LOT OF OTHER OPTIONS 
HE COULD HAVE DONE WITH BEING 
STRAIGHTER ON IT BUT HE IS O. K. 
THAT CERTAINLY CLEARED THE POCKET 
FOR THE BLACK 
NOT ALL OF THE POTS 
ARE GOING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
POCKET SOME ASKED WEDDING IN OFF 
THE JAWS SLIDING IN 
FOR ME HE HAS TO MAKE ENOUGH HERE 
TO SECURE THIS SIXTH FRAME HE WOULD 
HAVE TO BE CARELESS TO BREAK DOWN 
HERE 
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT JUNCTURE FOR 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
THIS IS HIS HIGHEST BREAK OF THE 
MATCH RED AND BLACK WILL BE ENOUGH 
IT LOOKS AS IF HE HAS STOPPED THE 
YOUNG NORTHERN IRISH PLAYER'S RUN 
STEPHEN LOVES MAKING A CENTURY 
BREAK IF HE KNOCKS THIS PINK IN 
YOU COULD POSSIBLY SEE ONE GOOD 
POT 
I DON'T THINK THE PINK WHEN IT IS 
SPOTTED IS GOING TO HELP HERE 
IT IS A TRICKY RED TO TRY AND MAKE 
THAT CENTURY SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTEEN CENTURIES HE HAS 
MADE IN HIS CAREER HE HAS MADE ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
CENTURIES AT THE CRUCIBLE SOME 
PLAYERS NEVER GET ANYWHERE NEAR 
THAT IN THEIR WHOLE CAREER 
THAT WAS A MISJUDGMENT CAN HE GET 
TO THIS RED CROSS BACK 
I THINK HE 
MAY HAVE TO APPLY A BIT OF SWERVE 
THAT IS A GOOD SHOT INCHING EVER 
CLOSER 
THIS IS A TERRIFIC PERFORMANCE 
AFTER THE BREAKS THAT MARK ALLEN 
HAS THROWN AT HIM 
BUT WE WERE SAYING IT LOOKS AS IF 
STEPHEN JUST NEEDED AN EASY OPENING 
THIS IS PROBABLY THE TYPE OF FORM 
THAT HE PRODUCES ON THE PRACTICE 
TABLE BUT HASN'T BEEN PRODUCING IN 
THE MATCH ARENA HE HAS STOPPED THE ROT SO TO SPEAK AND THE PINK FOR THE ONE HUNDRED 
ABSOLUTELY SUPERB BREAK BUILDER 
THE BEST THERE HAS EVER BEEN 
STEPHEN HENDRY WILL BE BREATHING A 
SIGH OF RELIEF HE STILL TRAILS UP 
FOUR TO TWO 
A BEAUTIFULLY MEASURED RESPONSE 
FROM STEPHEN HENDRY BEHIND US WE 
HAVE CHALLENGE GOING ON THEY ARE 
RUNNING AROUND THIS PROCESS 
PRACTICE TABLE WHAT KIND OF RELIEF 
YOU IMAGINE THAT CENTURY WILL BE 
FOR STEPHEN HENDRY 
A GREAT 
CHARACTER BUILD A IF EVER HE 
NEEDED IT BUT AS THE COMMENTATORS 
SAID A VERY IMPORTANT JUNCTURE IN 
THE GAME STEPHEN HENDRY AS YOU 
WOULD EXPECT HAS REPLIED IT IS 
NOT OVER HE HAS GOT A LOT OF PRIDE 
IN HIM AND HE IS GRAFTING AWAY A A LOT TO HAVE HALTED THE MOMENTUM IT 
FROM MARK ALLEN HOW IMPORTANT IS 
THAT AT THIS STAGE 
IT MIGHT MAKE 
HIM THINK AS WELL MARK ALLEN HAS 
BEEN GETTING THE RUN OF THINGS HE 
IS PLAYING GREAT LET'S NOT TAKE 
AWAY FROM HIM BUT STEPHEN 
MAKING A CENTURY IN THAT CONTROLLED 
WEIGHT MIGHT MAKE HIM THINK HE IS 
NOT PLAYING AS BAD AS I THOUGHT HE 
WAS THIS IS A MASSIVE FRAME 
COMING UP 
LET'S GET STRAIGHT BACK 
TO IT BETTER PACE WITH THE BREAK OFF SHOT 
THERE IS STILL A POSSIBLE POT ON 
BUT IT IS STILL DIFFICULT WITH THE 
WHITE THAT CLOSE TO THE CUSHION IT 
IS GOING OVER THE MIDDLE POCKET BY 
THE LOOKS OF THINGS AND IT SHOWS 
YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING 
GOOD WHITE FROM THE BREAK OFF SHOT 
STEPHEN HENDRY NOW HAS AN EARLY 
CHANCE AND THEY ARE SITTING PRETTY 
WELL HERE 
RIGHT DOWN THE CUE OF STEPHEN 
HENDRY 
THAT CUE HAS WON ABOUT EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION 
OF PRIZE MONEY 
THAT HIS CONCENTRATION THERE HE 
GOT UP CHANGED HIS MIND AND YOU 
COULD SEE HIM HESITATE THAT WAS 
JUST A LAPSE IN CONCENTRATION THAT COULD BE A COSTLY MISTAKE 
YOU JUST CANNOT HAVE ANY HESITATION 
HE WAS GOING TO PLAY FOR THE BLUE 
THEN HE GETS UP FROM THE SHOT 
CHANGES HIS MIND 
HE DECLARED A FOUL ON HIMSELF THERE 
MARK 
YOU EXPECT THAT IN THE GAME BUT IT 
IS ALWAYS NICE TO SEE WELL PLAYED 
YOUNG MAN 
YES EVERY CREDIT TO HIM 
FOR THAT HE JUST TOUCHED IT YOU 
FEEL IT STRAIGHT AWAY WITH YOUR CUE 
IT HAPPENED LAST WEEK WITH PAUL 
CASEY IN THE MASTERS THE BALL 
MOVED SLICE SEAT A SLIGHTLY AND 
HE CALLED FOR THE REFEREE AND 
DECLARED A FOUL ON HIMSELF THIS IS 
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT GOLF AND SNOOKER 
APPLAUSE THERE BUT I DO NOT THINK 
HE 
HAS GOT THE SNOOKER THINK HE HAS LEFT A CHANCE TO THE RIGHT 
CORNER STEPHEN'S LONG POTTING IS 
NOT THAT HIGH HE WOULD NOT 
APPROACH THIS WITH MUCH CONFIDENCE 
THAT TIME HE DID TO MAKE IT AS A SHOT TO NOTHING 
THE MORE PACE OF COURSE THE MORE 
CHANCE OF THE MISSING IT BECAUSE 
YOU HAVE TO BE MORE ACCURATE 
THE RED HE PLAYED HE DID LEAVE AND 
IT HAS BEEN DULY KNOCKED KNOCKED 
IN 
IT IS A BIT TIGHT THAT HE WOULD 
LOVE TO PLAY THAT BUT IT LOOKS A 
BIT TIGHT HE HAS GOT ANOTHER RED 
AVAILABLE INTO THE LEFT CORNER 
POCKET BUT IT IS NOT AS EASY FOR 
THE POSITION THE WHITE WILL BE 
GOING TOWARDS THE REDS THIS IS NOT 
STRAIGHTFORWARD QUITE AN IMPORTANT 
SHOT COMING UP LOOKING AT THE 
ANGLE THAT HE HAS 
HE IS JUST CHECKING TO SEE IF HE 
COULD POSSIBLY BRING THE PINK INTO 
PLAY OR LEAVE IT ON INTO THE 
MIDDLE WHAT ANGLE HAS HE GOT ON 
THIS RED 
IT WAS THE PINK HE WAS HOPING TO BE 
ON AND SOMEHOW HE HAS LEFT A 
CHANCE OF THE BLACK ALTHOUGH IT IS 
NOT EASY 
IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER IF HE WAS 
A RIGHT HANDER 
GOOD RECOVERY BUT THAT COULD BE 
THE END OF BREAK I FEEL 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 
TO LEAVE THIS PARTICULAR MATCH 
JUST TO UPDATE YOU WITH EVENTS ON 
THE OTHER TABLE CARTER WAS LEADING 
SEVEN TO FIVE HE HAS HAD TRIALS AND 
TRIBULATIONS IT IS CURRENTLY SEVEN TO SIX 
THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN A FRAME FOURTEEN 
THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN A FRAME FOURTEEN COMING NEXT WE HAVE RUGBY 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT RUGBY 
LEAGUE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BE A COMPANY 
WE WILL BE DUE IN THE CLUTCHES OF FAMOUS ULSTERMAN
