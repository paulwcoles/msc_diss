MATHS CHANNEL 
THE CHANNEL YOU CAN COUNT ON 
THIS PROGRAMME IS ABOUT PLACE VALUE AND PUTTING NUMBERS IN ORDER 
THESE CHILDREN WAITING TO TAKE THEIR TURN ON THE SLIDE 
ARE ALL DIFFERENT AGES BUT WHO'S THE OLDEST AND WHO'S THE YOUNGEST 
THE CHILDREN ARE AGED SIX NINE FIVE SEVEN 
AND BECAUSE THE BABY ISN'T EVEN ONE YET 
WE'LL SAY THE BABY IS ZERO YEARS OLD 
WE CAN MAKE IT EASIER TO SEE WHO'S THE OLDEST AND WHO'S THE YOUNGEST 
BY PUTTING THEM IN ORDER YOUNGEST OR SMALLEST NUMBER FIRST 
BIGGEST NUMBER LAST AND THE OTHERS LINED UP IN ORDER IN BETWEEN 
MATHS CHANNEL 
ANOTHER WAY TO LINE UP THESE CHILDREN IS ON A NUMBER LINE 
OUR SMALLEST NUMBER IS ZERO 
SO THEY LINE UP WITH ZERO ON THE LINE 
OUR BIGGEST NUMBER IS NINE SO MOVES ONTO THE NINE 
AND ALL THE OTHER NUMBERS LINE UP IN ORDER IN BETWEEN 
SO NOW IT'S EASY TO SEE HOW OLD THE CHILDREN ARE 
AND THE GAPS IN AGE BETWEEN THEM 
WE HAVE THE VERY YOUNG CHILD AT ZERO 
A BIG JUMP TO THE NEXT OLDEST AT FIVE 
A JUMP OF JUST ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT CHILD 
AND THE NEXT ONE 
AND A JUMP OF TWO YEARS TO THE OLDEST CHILD 
NOW WE CAN SEE THE ORDER OF THE NUMBERS AND THE GAPS BETWEEN THEM 
PUT THE SMALLEST NUMBER FIRST 
THE BIGGEST NUMBER LAST 
AND THE OTHERS ALL IN ORDER IN BETWEEN 
WITH THE SMALLEST NUMBER FIRST 
AND THE BIGGEST NUMBER LAST 
THE ORDER OF THE NUMBERS VERY PLAINLY CAN BE SEEN 
I HAVE ZERO UP TO NINE 
YES ZERO UP TO NINE 
PUT THE NUMBERS IN THE PLACE THAT THEY SHOULD BE 
WITH THE NUMBERS ON THE LINE 
YES THE NUMBERS ON THE LINE 
THE JUMPS BETWEEN THE NUMBERS VERY PLAINLY CAN BE SEEN 
MATHS CHANNEL 
PUTTING NUMBERS IN ORDER CAN BE USEFUL FOR LOTS OF THINGS 
THIS IS A BALLOON RACE AND EVERY CHILD HAS A BALLOON 
WITH THEIR NAME AND ADDRESS WRITTEN ON A TAG ATTACHED TO THE BALLOON 
OFF THEY GO THE BALLOON THAT FLIES THE FURTHEST DISTANCE WINS THE RACE 
THE PERSON WHO FINDS THE BALLOON AFTER IT LANDS 
WRITES ON THE TAG WHERE IT LANDED HOW FAR IT TRAVELLED 
AND POSTS THE TAG BACK TO THE OWNER 
SO HERE WE ARE ONE WEEK LATER 
ALL THE BALLOONS HAVE LANDED 
AND THE TAGS HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO THEIR OWNERS 
WITH THE NUMBER OF KILOMETRES THEY HAVE TRAVELLED WRITTEN ON THE TAGS 
FIRST WE NEED TO PUT THE NUMBERS INTO ORDER 
STARTING WITH THE LOWEST NUMBERS 
THE NUMBERS WITH ONE DIGIT ARE THE LOWEST 
BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL LESS THAN TEN SO WE PUT THEM IN ORDER FIRST 
THAT LEAVES ALL THE NUMBERS WITH TWO DIGITS 
THE ONES STARTING WITH ONE 
THE TEEN NUMBERS ARE NEXT 
THEN WE DO THE TWENTIES 
NOW WE CAN SEE THEM ALL IN ORDER 
NOW WE CAN EASILY SEE WHOSE BALLOON TRAVELLED THE SHORTEST DISTANCE 
AND WHOSE BALLOON TRAVELLED THE FURTHEST 
ALL THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN PUT IN ORDER 
BY LOOKING CLOSELY AT THEIR DIGITS 
SINGLE DIGITS FIRST 
FIND THE SINGLE DIGITS FIRST 
THE SINGLE DIGITS FIRST 
THAT'S ANY NUMBER ZERO UP TO NINE 
PUT THE LOWEST NUMBER FIRST 
THE HIGHEST NUMBER LAST 
THEN ANY OTHER NUMBERS GET IN ORDER IN A LINE 
DOUBLE DIGIT NUMBERS NEXT 
IF THE FIRST DIGIT IS ONE 
THEY'RE THE NEXT UP TO BE DONE 
THAT'S ANY NUMBER TEN UP TO NINETEEN 
IF THEIR FIRST DIGIT IS TWO 
THEY'RE THE NEXT LOT YOU MUST DO 
WITH ALL THE NUMBERS IN A LINE 
THEIR ORDER CAN BE SEEN 
SO THE CHILDREN WHO'VE HAD THE BALLOON RACE ARE STANDING IN ORDER 
BUT WE CAN ALSO SHOW THEM ON A PROPER NUMBER LINE 
WITH GAPS BETWEEN THE NUMBERS 
SO IF WE SLIDE IN THE START OF A FULL NUMBER LINE 
AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN 
THE SINGLE DIGIT NUMBERS TAKE THEIR PLACES FIRST 
THEN THE TEEN NUMBERS THIRTEEN FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN NEXT 
AND FINALLY THE TWENTIES NUMBERS ON THE END OF THE NUMBER LINE 
WE NOW HAVE ONE LONG NUMBER LINE 
AND THE CORRECT GAPS BETWEEN THE CHILDREN'S NUMBERS 
BUT THE NUMBERS IN THIS NUMBER LINE ARE NOW TINY 
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE IT EASIER TO SEE ALL THE NUMBERS 
AND STILL HAVE THE GAPS IN BETWEEN 
WELL WE CAN CUT THE NUMBER LINE UP AND REARRANGE IT 
SINGLE DIGIT NUMBERS ON THE TOP THE TEEN NUMBERS IN THE MIDDLE 
AND THE TWENTIES NUMBERS AT THE BOTTOM 
NOW WE HAVE A LARGER CLEAR VERY USEFUL NUMBER RECTANGLE 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE MATHS CHANNEL QUIZ SHOW 
O. K. DANIEL I'D LIKE YOU TO LOOK AT THIS NUMBER RECTANGLE 
LOOKING JUST AT THE RED NUMBERS 
CAN YOU TELL ME A NUMBER THAT IS ONE MORE THAN ANOTHER NUMBER 
ER 
ZERO POINT ONE SIX IS ONE MORE THAN FIFTEEN 
YES BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW 
WELL THEY'RE BOTH NEXT TO EACH OTHER ON THE SAME ROW 
YES NUMBERS ON THE SAME ROW HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF ONE 
NOW CHRIS USING THE NUMBER RECTANGLE 
CAN YOU TELL ME A NUMBER THAT HAS A DIFFERENCE OF TEN 
ONE NUMBER THAT IS TEN MORE THAN ANOTHER NUMBER 
E. R. SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SIX 
CORRECT BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW 
ER 
DANIEL CAN YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION ER YEAH 
WELL TWENTY SIX IS EXACTLY UNDERNEATH SIXTEEN ON THE NUMBER RECTANGLE 
AND THAT MEANS IT MUST BE EXACTLY TEN MORE 
YES TWENTY SIX IS TEN MORE THAN SIXTEEN 
NOW BOTH OF YOU USING A NUMBER RECTANGLE 
WHAT IS THE EASY WAY TO FIND A NUMBER 
ELEVEN MORE THAN ANOTHER NUMBER 
I GOT IT 
YOU MOVE DOWN A ROW AND THEN GO RIGHT 
SHOW US 
WELL YOU START AT FIVE THEN YOU GO DOWN A ROW TO FIFTEEN 
AND THEN YOU ADD ONE WHICH IS SIXTEEN 
YES CHRIS YOU GOT THE ANSWER RIGHT TODAY 
BUT HOW ABOUT YOU OUT THERE 
CAN YOU ANSWER THIS QUESTION 
USING A NUMBER RECTANGLE WHAT IS THE EASY WAY TO ADD TWENTY TWO 
GOOD LUCK AND CHEERIO
