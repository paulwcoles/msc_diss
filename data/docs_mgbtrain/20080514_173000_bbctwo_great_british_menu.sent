THE FIGHT GOES ON ON GREAT BRITISH MENU 
THE BEST CHEFS IN BRITAIN ARE BATTLING FOR THE CHANCE TO PROVE 
TO PROVE THAT OUR CUTTING EDGE COOKING IS AS GOOD AS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD 
THE WINNERS WILL PREPARE A FABULOUS FOUR COURSE MEAL AT THE APEX OF THE ICONIC GHERKIN IN CENTRAL LONDON 
HOSTING THAT MAGNIFICENT BANQUET WILL BE THE CULINARY TRAILBLAZER HESTON BLUMENTHAL 
AND THE GUEST LIST WILL BE BRIMMING WITH TOP CHEFS FROM THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH 
SO OUR CHEFS REALLY ARE FACING THEIR TOUGHEST CHALLENGE YET 
GOING HEAD TO HEAD IN THIS WEEK'S HEAT TO REPRESENT LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST IN OUR FINALS 
ARE ATUL KOCHHAR AND JASON ATHERTON 
THE LAST TWO DAYS WERE GOOD THIS ONE WILL BE EXCELLENT 
YOU WANT TO BEAT SOMEBODY WHEN THEY'RE TRYING THEIR HARDEST 
BECAUSE IT MEANS YOUR HARDEST IS EVEN BETTER 
ATUL KOCHHAR AND JASON ATHERTON 
ARE EQUALLY DETERMINED TO REPRESENT LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST AT THE GHERKIN BANQUET 
WHILE BOTH MICHELIN STARRED CHEFS SERVE FOOD WITH INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCES 
JASON FAVOURS A MODERN BRITISH TAPAS STYLE WHEREAS ATUL DESCRIBES HIS FOOD AS BRITISH INDIAN 
BOTH CHEFS HAVE COME UP WITH ORIGINAL FOUR COURSE MENUS THAT 
THEY BELIEVE SHOW OFF CONTEMPORARY BRITISH COOKING AT ITS BEST 
SO EVERY DAY THIS WEEK THEY'RE COOKING A DIFFERENT COURSE 
AND THE FULL MENUS WILL BE DISHED UP FOR THE JUDGES ON FRIDAY 
WITH A CHANCE TO COOK FOR SOME OF THE WORLD'S FINEST CHEFS AND GOURMETS 
ATUL AND JASON ARE PREPARING FOR DAY THREE OF THE FIGHT 
AND WITH JUST TWO COURSES LEFT BEFORE JUDGEMENT DAY THE COMPETITION CAN ONLY GET TOUGHER 
I DON'T GET OUT OF BED FIRST THING IN THE MORNING TO COME AND DO A COMPETITION LIKE THIS NOT TO WIN IT 
JASON IS A GREAT CHEF 
I REALLY LIKE HIM RESPECT HIM BUT I HAVE DEFINITELY COME HERE TO WIN 
THE CHEFS HAVE ALREADY MADE THEIR STARTER AND FISH COURSES AND THEY'RE WORKING TO A VERY HIGH STANDARD 
ON MONDAY 
ATUL SHOWED OFF HIS INDIAN ROOTS WITH HIS STARTER OF 
CHILLED PEA AND CUMIN SOUP 
SERVED UP WITH POTATO AND PEA POPPADOMS OR POORI 
MEANWHILE JASON CAME UP WITH HIS MODERN TAKE 
ON A PLATE OF SANDWICHES CROQUE MONSIEUR AND A GLASS OF B. L. T. 
YESTERDAY THE CHEFS CHOSE THE SAME FISH 
IT WAS A SALMON SHOWDOWN AS JASON CAME UP WITH A CURED SMOKED VERSION 
WITH HORSERADISH SNOW A RYE BREAD CRACKER AVOCADO AND WATERCRESS 
ATUL SERVED UP HIS SPICY INTERPRETATION OF FISH MADRAS 
CONFIT OF SALMON ACCOMPANIED BY TOMATO CHUTNEY AND SEMOLINA POLENTA 
SO WHAT WILL THE CHEFS COME UP WITH TODAY FOR THEIR MODERN BRITISH MAIN COURSES 
HI ATUL 
HELLO HOW ARE YOU 
ROUND THREE DING DING 
DING DING 
SO WHAT ARE YOU COOKING TODAY THIS IS DEXTER BEEF FILLET YOU SEE HOW SMALL IT IS 
THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING BEEF EVER I'M SERVING THAT WITH OX CHEEK OX CHEEK 
SMOKED POMME PUREE AND THEN SOME BEEF MARROW OFF THE DEXTER 
BUT ATUL'S NOT CONVINCED THAT JASON'S CHOSEN THE RIGHT MEAT 
DON'T YOU THINK THAT BEEF WILL BE JUST TOO PREDICTABLE FROM AN ENGLISH LAD 
YOU CAN SAY THAT BUT THE IDEA OF THE DISH 
IS TO USE THREE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BEEF SHOWING YOU THREE DIFFERENT TEXTURES 
AND WHEN YOU TASTE THE SMOKED POMME PUREE 
YOU'LL SEE HOW DIFFERENT THAT IS AND THE MODERN TECHNIQUE I'M USING 
SO TO REVIVE THE TRADITIONAL PLATE OF BRITISH BEEF HE'S 
COOKING THE MEAT IN A MODERN WAY AND SERVING IT ON A STYLISH BOARD 
HIS DEXTER FILLET OX CHEEK AND MARROWBONE WILL BE COMPLEMENTED BY 
BABY ARTICHOKES SMOKED POMME PUREE AND BRIOCHE BREADCRUMBS 
BUT ATUL'S STILL SURPRISED AT JASON'S CHOICE 
I THINK HE'S PLAYING SAFE TOO SAFE AND HE'S ONE GUY WHOM I WAS REALLY LOOKING UP TO THAT HE WOULD 
PUSH THE BOUNDARIES TO THE MAXIMUM BECAUSE HE IS ONE GUY IN THIS MATCH WHO KNOWS HOW TO DO IT 
SO IS HE PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES HIMSELF 
I'M MAKING AYLESBURY DUCK 
IT'S LOCAL IT'S ALSO A DOMESTICATED BIRD WHICH IS MEANT TO BE EATEN YEAR ROUND 
YEAH I'LL BE SERVING THAT WITH FOIE GRAS ICE CREAM 
YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF EL BULLI STUFF THIS WEEK 
NO IT'S MAZE STUFF YOU WAS THE GUY SWEEPING THE FLOORS AT EL BULLI STEALING THE RECIPES RIGHT 
YOU'RE RIGHT ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
JASON TRAINED AT EL BULLI IN SPAIN WHICH IS A WORLD LEADER IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY COOKING TECHNIQUES 
ATUL'S SPICY AYLESBURY DUCK BREAST 
IS GOING TO BE SERVED WITH A FOIE GRAS ICE CREAM 
THAT SOUNDS VERY POSH 
ACCOMPANIED BY A CORIANDER COCONUT PESTO 
WITH MANGO AND PINEAPPLE SALSA 
ATUL'S WON THIS HEAT FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS 
HE'S BUSTING A GUT TO RETAIN HIS CROWN AND JASON KNOWS IT 
HE HAS PUT HIMSELF UP THERE AGAIN WITH A REAL HIGH TECHNICAL SORT OF DISH 
AND HE'S GONNA HAVE TO PULL THAT OFF YOU KNOW 
IT'S A TYPICALLY EXOTIC DISH FOR ATUL AND HIS OPPONENT IS QUICK TO POKE FUN AT THE INGREDIENTS 
IS THAT YOUR LOCAL PINEAPPLE ATUL 
GLOBALLY LOCAL 
BUT JASON HAS RESERVATIONS ABOUT ATUL'S MAIN INGREDIENT TOO 
DUCK'S ONE OF THESE THINGS IN THE RESTAURANT I DON'T USE TOO MUCH 
WHY'S THAT BECAUSE ONE IN EVERY TEN DUCKS THE MEAT GOES TOUGH 
DO YOU FIND THAT NOT REALLY BECAUSE I LIKE TO KEEP MY DUCK MEDIUM RARE 
I'M JUST A BAD CHEF NO YOU'RE A GREAT CHEF BUT IT'S JUST I LIKE TO KEEP IT MEDIUM RARE 
IF ANYBODY ASKS FOR IT I'LL DO IT BUT IT'LL GO TOUGH AND IT'S NOT MY FAULT MM 
THREE DAYS INTO THE SOUTH EAST HEAT ATUL KOCHHAR IS MAINTAINING 
HIS REPUTATION AS GREAT BRITISH MENU'S SPICE MASTER 
HE'S SPENT A LOT OF TIME BUILDING ON HIS EXPERIENCE WITH EXOTIC FLAVOURS 
AND WHEN HE'S NOT IN THE KITCHEN YOU MIGHT SPOT HIM FOLLOWING HIS NOSE DOWN THE HIGH STREET 
I LIKE TO GO OUT AND SHOP FOR MY SPICES AND HERBS AS OFTEN AS I CAN 
I GO TO VARIOUS PLACES 
I WOULD GO TO A SPICE SHOP I WOULD GO TO A VEGETABLE MARKET WHEREVER THE SPICES AND HERBS ARE BEING SOLD 
WITH HIS STRONG INDIAN ROOTS AND LONG HISTORY OF COOKING WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF INGREDIENTS 
IT WOULD BE EASY TO THINK THAT ATUL HAD ALREADY COME ACROSS EVERY FLAVOURING THERE IS 
GOING INTO A SPICE AND HERB MARKET IS ALWAYS AN EXPERIENCE 
YOU ALWAYS PICK UP SOMETHING NEW WHICH YOU DON'T KNOW YOU HAVE NOT USED IN YOUR FOOD 
I'M ALMOST LIKE A CHILD RUNNING BETWEEN THE AISLES TO SEE WHAT IS THERE 
BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW MORE WHAT I CAN BRING NEW TO MY PLATE 
HIS CONSTANT SEARCH FOR NEW FLAVOURS CERTAINLY MAKES HIM A MODERN INNOVATIVE CHEF 
BUT WHAT WOULD HIS MENU BE LIKE WITHOUT ALL THESE EXCITING INGREDIENTS 
THE SPICES AND HERBS ARE REALLY AN INTEGRAL PART OF INDIAN COOKING 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO THINK OF INDIAN FOOD WITHOUT SPICES AND HERBS 
SO ATUL ISN'T ABOUT TO TURN HIS BACK ON HIS COOKING HERITAGE 
BUT WITH THIS YEAR'S COMPETITION DEMANDING THE BEST IN MODERN BRITISH COOKING 
WHERE DOES HE SEE HIS STYLE FITTING IN 
I'VE ACCEPTED THAT I COOK BRITISH FOOD WITH MY HEART AND SOUL BECAUSE I USE BRITISH PRODUCE 
I COOK WITH A DIFFERENT INFLUENCE BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME ANY LESS BRITISH THAN ANYONE HERE 
BACK IN OUR KITCHEN THE MAIN COURSES THE CHEFS ARE PREPARING ARE DEFINITELY BRITISH 
BUT ARE THEY REALLY CONTEMPORARY 
I KNOW YOU AS A VERY MODERN CHEF 
AND USING BEEF CHEEK IS A BIT OF A CLASSIC 
I WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS A CLASSIC 
WHAT IT IS ATUL IS YOU KNOW LET'S BE HONEST ANYBODY CAN LEARN TO COOK 
A DECENT PIECE OF FILLET OF BEEF RIGHT THAT'S TRUE BUT TO COOK THIS TYPE OF MEAT TAKES SKILL 
YOU KNOW IN THE PREPARATION IN THE MARINADE IN THE COOKING TIME 
THERE'S NOT MANY CHEFS TAKE A PRIDE IN COOKING THIS TYPE OF FOOD 
JASON'S METICULOUS PREPARATION AND EXACTING STANDARDS CAME FROM YEARS OF TRAINING AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL 
JASON ATHERTON WAS BORN AND RAISED IN SKEGNESS 
BUT HIS AMBITION TO BE A TOP CHEF BROUGHT HIM TO LONDON AND HE'S LIVED HERE FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW 
HAVING TRAINED IN KITCHENS ACROSS SPAIN FRANCE AND DUBAI JASON BROUGHT THOSE 
INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCES BACK TO THE U. K. AND THEY'VE BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS WITH RESTAURANT GOERS 
I THINK I'VE BEEN A LEADER 
IN MODERN BRITISH TAPAS WITH MY TIME IN SPAIN I REALISED 
IT WAS A NICER WAY TO EAT RATHER THAN BEING STUFFED WITH A STARTER MAIN COURSE DESSERT 
WHICH WAS TRADITION TO OUR CULTURE I WANTED TO EXPAND FROM THAT 
AND GIVE LONDON SOMETHING IT'S NEVER HAD BEFORE 
SO IT WAS HIS OWN VISION TO OFFER US A NEW STYLE OF EATING 
BUT HE WAS HELPED ON HIS WAY BY INVALUABLE TRAINING FROM SOME OF THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS 
I WORKED FOR TWO OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST FAMOUS CHEFS GORDON RAMSAY AND MARCO PIERRE WHITE 
WHAT HAS THAT TAUGHT ME THAT'S TAUGHT ME A 
I'M A WORKAHOLIC B. I'M A MEGALOMANIAC WITH CLEANLINESS TIDINESS 
ORGANISATION SKILLS FROM GORDON RAMSAY SECOND TO NONE PERFECTION FROM BOTH OF THEM IS SECOND TO NONE 
I BELIEVE WITHOUT WORKING FOR THOSE GUYS I WOULDN'T BE THE STRONG CHEF I AM TODAY 
AND THAT RESPECT IS RECIPROCATED BY MR. RAMSAY HIMSELF 
HE EATS A LOT AROUND THE WORLD AND HE HAS THE MOST AMAZING SORT OF INSIGHT TO DECONSTRUCTING A DISH 
SO EVEN IF HE NEVER GETS TO WORK IN THEIR KITCHEN A FAMOUS CHEF'S KITCHEN 
HE'LL KNOW HOW THEY COOK BY JUST EATING IN THE DINING ROOM 
VERY FEW CHEFS CAN PICK THAT UP INSTANTLY LIKE JASON CAN 
SO JASON HAS IMPECCABLE CREDENTIALS BUT HOW DOES HE FEEL ABOUT BEING 
UP AGAINST ATUL THE CURRENT SOUTH EAST CHAMPION IN GREAT BRITISH MENU 
IT DOESN'T DAUNT ME IN THE SLIGHTEST BEING IN ANOTHER KITCHEN OPPOSITE MY ARCH RIVAL 
WE'RE BOTH WITHOUT BRIGADES WE'RE BOTH ON OUR OWN 
IT'S WHO IS THE BETTER COOK AND I BELIEVE MY BACKGROUND WILL SEE ME THROUGH I'M POSITIVE ABOUT IT 
AND DOES GORDON THINK HE CAN DO IT 
GOING UP AGAINST THE REIGNING CHAMPION IS NOT EASY BUT JASON THRIVES ON PRESSURE 
THE MORE PRESSURE HE'S UNDER THE BETTER HE'LL PERFORM 
BACK IN OUR KITCHEN JASON MAY BE TRYING TO UNDERMINE ATUL'S CONFIDENCE 
WHAT MADE YOU CHOOSE DUCK I'M MORE COMFORTABLE WITH POULTRY TO BE HONEST SO THAT'S WHY I CHOSE DUCK 
WELL HE BATTED THAT ONE AWAY EASILY ENOUGH SO JASON TRIES SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO JUSTIFY SERVING 
FOIE GRAS ICE CREAM WITH DUCK YOU KNOW WITH THE HOT AND COLD 
IT'S ONE COMBINATION WHICH WORKS 
I CREATE A BRIDGE IN BETWEEN A SALSA BRIDGE 
OUT OF THE SPICES THEY REALLY MAKE A GOOD TRANSITION FROM HOT TO COLD 
AND DUCK IS NOT SERVED REALLY REALLY HOT IT'S SERVED JUST WARM ENOUGH 
HE HAS EVERY CONFIDENCE IN HIS DUCK AND HE ISN'T OVERAWED BY THE NEW BOY'S BEEF EITHER 
LOOK AT THAT FOR FILLET 
NORMALLY FILLET IS ABOUT FOUR TIMES THE SIZE OF THAT 
IT LOOKS LIKE A PYGMY CATTLE TO ME 
THESE ARE TINY I'M NOT THE BIGGEST OF GUYS AND THEY'RE THERE IT'S AMAZING 
ATUL IS UNMOVED 
BUT HIS YOUNG CHALLENGER HAD GONE TO THE TROUBLE OF FINDING SOME VERY FINE BRITISH BEEF 
HE JOURNEYED SOUTH WEST OF THE CAPITAL INTO THE SURREY COUNTRYSIDE 
AND FINISHED UP ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF GUILDFORD AT HATCHLANDS PARK 
THIS BEAUTIFUL NATIONAL TRUST PROPERTY IS TEEMING WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED DEXTER CATTLE AND THEY WERE HUNGRY 
THE HERD ACTUALLY COMES FROM A NEARBY FARM BUT GRAZING HERE HELPS TO MAINTAIN THE LANDSCAPE 
JASON MET UP WITH NEIL WILLIAMS WHOSE FAMILY OWN THE PETITE COWS 
WHAT FASCINATES ME IS THE SIZE OF THE ANIMAL 
YEAH THEY'RE NICE AND SMALL BUT THEY CAN BE JUST AS STRONG 
BUT THEY DON'T CHURN THE GROUND UP 
THEY LIVE HERE ALL YEAR ROUND WHICH IS A MUCH NICER LIFE FOR THEM WONDERFUL 
DEXTERS ARE A HARDY BREED DESCENDED FROM THE BLACK CATTLE OF THE EARLY CELTS IN IRELAND 
APART FROM A FEW CALVES THIS LOT ARE ALL FEMALES AND DESPITE THEIR SHARP HORNS RELATIVELY PLACID 
YOU ONLY KEEP ONE BULL FOR ALL OF THESE FEMALES 
YES COS WHEN HE COMES OVER HE JUST RUNS LOOSE WITH THEM AND THEN THE REST OF THE MALES GO OFF FOR MEAT 
SO HE'S THE LUCKY ONE YES 
BUT BACK AT NEIL'S FARM THERE WAS ANOTHER LUCKY ONE A CALF CALLED EMILY 
SHE WAS BORN WHEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TORRENTIAL RAIN REALLY COLD IF SHE HAD BEEN LEFT OVERNIGHT 
THERE WAS NO WAY SHE WOULD SURVIVE SO BEST THING WAS BRING HER HERE BOTTLE FEED HER 
AND THEN RETURN HER TO THE HERD AT FOUR MONTHS OLD WHERE SHE CAN LOOK AFTER HERSELF 
HUNGRY LITTLE THING 
LOOK AT YOU 
I'VE FED LOTS OF HUNGRY PEOPLE BEFORE BUT NEVER A COW 
AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT EMILY HAS NOW REJOINED THE BREEDING HERD 
BUT BEFORE HE LEFT JASON VISITED THE FARM SHOP TO MEET GENERAL MANAGER LYNNE WILLIAMS 
MORNING LYNNE MORNING JASON HOW ARE YOU FINE THANK YOU 
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO COOKING IT AND TASTING IT 
I'VE USED DEXTER IN THE PAST BUT OBVIOUSLY COS THIS IS SO EXCLUSIVE NOT FROM THIS PARTICULAR FARM 
YES IT'S NOT COMMERCIAL AT ALL IT IS PURELY JUST FROM HERE 
YOU CAN SEE THAT WITH THE BEAUTIFUL MARBLING AND STUFF 
I'VE NEVER REALLY SEEN THAT MARBLING IN A NORMAL BEEF BEFORE WHICH IS AMAZING 
A LOT OF THIS I THINK IS DOWN TO OUR BUTCHER 
AGEING IT AND WE'RE AFTER A SORT OF CENTRE CUT FILLET 
THAT WE CAN REST AS ONE WHOLE PIECE SO WE CAN TAKE BEAUTIFUL SLICES OFF IT SO IT'S REALLY NICE AND PINK 
AND HOPEFULLY THE JUDGES WILL GO FOR OUR BEEF WHAT D'YOU THINK I HOPE SO 
THEY SHOULD DO IT'S NICE BEEF 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN THE ACTION'S DEFINITELY HOTTING UP 
SO WHAT ARE YOU BURNING JASON 
I'M BURNING MY OX CHEEK 
A LITTLE BIT OF FLAMBEING BEAUTIFUL THAT CAN YOU SMELL THEM 
I'LL HAVE A REAL TOUGH TIME TASTING IT 
THEY'VE BEEN MARINATED FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS IN RED WINE 
AND PORT AND VEGETABLES AND THEN I'M JUST SEALING THEM OFF NOW 
I'M GOING TO SLOWLY BRAISE THEM THEN FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS TILL THEY'RE NICE AND TENDER O. K. 
JASON'S NEXT JOB IS HIS SMOKED POMME PUREE 
HE BEGINS BY WARMING UP SOME OAK WOOD CHIPS 
AS THEY HEAT UP THE SCENT FROM THE WOOD WILL INFUSE HIS MILK 
WITH A SMOKY AROMA AND THAT'S ALREADY BROUGHT ATUL ROUND TO INVESTIGATE 
POUR THE MILK IN 
WHAT I DO THEN JUST STICK IT ON THE STOVE AND IT BURNS ITSELF 
AND IT BURNS ITSELF YEAH 
HE'S GOING TO A LOT OF BOTHER TO FLAVOUR THE MILK 
AND ATUL WONDERS IF HIS OPPONENT REALLY KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING 
YOU'RE CLING FILMING IT DO YOU THINK IT WILL NOT MELT IT DOWN NO NO 
TRUST ME ATUL I'M A SEASONED PROFESSIONAL 
WELL THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
BUT IT DOES LOOK LIKE SOMETHING THEY MIGHT DO ON BLUE PETER 
WE'LL CREATE LIKE A DOME AND THE SMOKE WILL BE COMPLETED TRAPPED IN THAT 
SO YOU'RE HOPING THAT THIS WILL MAKE THE TRADITIONAL DISH MODERN 
I'M NOT HOPING I KNOW IT'S GOING TO 
I DON'T LIVE ON HOPE ATUL 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT PRIDE COMING BEFORE A FALL 
JASON'S INFALLIBLE SMOKING DEVICE HAS ONLY JUST GOT GOING WHEN ATUL SPOTS A FLAW IN IT 
THE SMOKE IS LEAKING YEAH IT'S LEAKING 
I TOLD YOU THE FLAVOUR HAS GONE NO DON'T YOU WORRY 
ARE YOU SURE YEAH I'LL JUST LEAVE IT FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER 
CAN YOU SMELL IT YEAH IT'S A BURNT SMELL ANYONE CAN SMELL IT 
FIRE ENGINES ARE OUT THERE 
HAVE YOU DIALLED NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
D'YOU THINK JASON'S GOT SHARES IN CLINGFILM 
HE NEEDS TO GET HIS ACT TOGETHER ATUL IS MOVING AHEAD CONFIDENTLY 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR LITTLE ARRAY OF SPICES OUT AGAIN WHICH ALWAYS MAKES ME NERVOUS 
THIS ONE IS A SERIOUS ONE BECAUSE 
THIS IS THE MAIN FLAVOUR TO MY DUCK 
BUT HE ISN'T JUST RELYING ON THE FLAVOUR 
HE'S ALSO COOKING IT IN AN UNUSUAL WAY 
A TECHNIQUE OF WATER BATH COOKING WHICH IS NOT USED IN 
SO CALLED BRITISH COOKING OR INDIAN COOKING 
I'M FUSING A LOT OF FLAVOURS AND TECHNIQUES 
AND THAT MAKES IT MODERN BRITISH COOKING FOR ME 
STILL TO COME ON GREAT BRITISH MENU ATUL MEETS SOME VERY HAPPY DUCKS 
THEY ARE SWIRLING THEIR TAILS LIKE DOGS WOULD DO ARE THEY HAPPY 
IT'S WHAUGH YOU KNOW 
AND THE CHEFS GET STUCK INTO ONE ANOTHER'S MAIN COURSES 
IT'S ALL ACTION IN THE KITCHEN NOW JASON'S PREPARING 
A MIXED BEEF PLATTER OF FILLET OX CHEEK AND MARROWBONE 
BABY ARTICHOKES AND SMOKED POMME PUREE WILL COMPLETE THE DISH 
BUT ATUL THINKS IT'S LESS THAN CHALLENGING 
THE ONLY ACCUSATION I HAVE FOR THIS IS HE'S PLAYING IT EXTREMELY SAFE 
HE'S NOT SHOWING OFF HIS SKILLS 
WHICH COULD BE A TACTICAL ERROR 
ATUL THINKS HE'S TAKING MORE OF A RISK WITH HIS MAIN COURSE 
DUCK BREAST PESTO AND A MANGO AND PINEAPPLE SALSA 
HE'S ALSO DEVISED AN UNUSUAL FOIE GRAS ICE CREAM 
WHICH JASON'S NOT SURE ABOUT 
BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE GUESTS IS IT NOT GOING TO LOOK MESSY 
LIKE A POOL OF SOGGY FOIE GRAS ON THE PLATE 
WHICH WOULD NOT BE NICE AND FOIE GRAS IS QUITE CONTENTIOUS ANYWAY 
BECAUSE ISN'T TO EVERYONE'S TASTE SO JASON WONDERS WHY ATUL'S USING IT 
IS IT BECAUSE CONSUMERS DEMAND IT OR BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE IN VOGUE TO USE FOIE GRAS 
TO TAKE THE CUISINE FORWARD 
I WOULD HAVE TO TRY USING THESE THINGS IN MY FOOD 
AND THERE'S ALSO A GENUINE DEMAND FOR IT 
AND THERE'S AN ETHICAL WAY OF SERVING FOIE GRAS ALSO BECAUSE 
NOT NECESSARILY EACH AND EVERY FOIE GRAS COMES FROM THE FORCE FED DUCK OR GOOSE 
I ONLY USE IT VERY LIMITED AT THE MOMENT AND I AM THINKING ABOUT SCRAPPING IT ALTOGETHER 
WELL IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF THE JUDGES RAISE THAT ON FRIDAY 
ATUL CARRIES ON WITH HIS CONTROVERSIAL ICE CREAM REGARDLESS 
AND MIXES EGGS YOLKS INTO THE CARAMELISED FOIE GRAS 
IT MAY NOT LOOK VERY ENTICING NOW BUT ATUL HOPES IT'LL MAKE A HIGHLY ORIGINAL ELEMENT FOR HIS DISH 
WHATEVER JASON THINKS OF IT THE TWO MEN DO AGREE ON ONE THING 
COOKING AT HESTON'S BANQUET WOULD BE AN EXTRAORDINARY ACCOLADE 
WHEN HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED BEFORE THAT ARRAY OF CHEFS SAT IN ONE DINING ROOM FOR ME 
THEY ARE HEROES OUT OF A COMIC YEAH LIKE PHANTOM AND MANDRAKE 
IN A GOOD SENSE YOU KNOW 
THEY ARE REAL HEROES FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO COOK FOR THEM WOULD BE GREAT I'M SURE FOR YOU TOO 
IT'S NERVE RACKING TOO THOUGH 
AT THE END OF THE DAY WHOEVER GOES THROUGH WE'VE GOT TO PULL IT OFF 
AND THAT IS QUITE SCARY YOU KNOW 
THE LAST THING WE NEED IS THEM COMING OVER HERE AND US SINGING AND DANCING 
ABOUT MODERN BRITISH AND THEM GOING WAY DISHEARTENED BY THE FACT THAT WE'VE NOT BROUGHT IT OFF 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE A SHAME 
A SHAME IT WOULD BE A DISASTER 
ATUL'S MAKING SURE HE'S UP WITH THE LATEST COOKING TECHNIQUES BY VACUUM PACKING HIS DUCK BREASTS 
AND POACHING THEM IN A WATER BATH 
HE WANTS THE JUDGES TO THINK IT'S THE VERY BEST DUCK THEY'VE EVER TASTED 
SO HE PUT ON HIS WELLIES AND SWAPPED MAYFAIR FOR LEAFY BUCKINGHAMSHIRE 
HIS QUEST LED HIM TO AYLESBURY WHICH IS OF COURSE FAMOUS FOR DUCKS 
HE HOOKED UP WITH RICHARD WALLER WHOSE FAMILY HAS BEEN BREEDING DUCKS IN THE VALE SINCE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE 
BUT EVEN THOUGH THE FARM IS IN THE RIGHT AREA ATUL WANTED TO KNOW 
WHETHER THESE WHITE BIRDS WERE THE GENUINE ARTICLE 
HOW DO YOU DEFINE IT THERE ARE SO MANY DUCKS 
A LARGE WHITE DUCK BRED IN LARGE NUMBERS AROUND THE AYLESBURY AREA 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE LAST FIFTY SIXTY YEARS NOW BRED ONLY IN ONE SPOT AND THAT'S HERE IT'S YOUR FAMILY 
THAT'S THE FAMILY BUSINESS YEAH SO ALL THE AYLESBURY DUCK I HAVE BEEN BUYING ALL THESE YEARS 
WERE A FAKE ONE UNFORTUNATELY WHEN YOU SAY FAKE ONE 
THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS A WHITE DUCK IS AN AYLESBURY ISN'T IT ABSOLUTELY NO IT'S NOT 
SO AYLESBURY DUCKS AREN'T JUST ANY OLD WHITE DUCK AS SOME PEOPLE THINK 
RICHARD PRODUCES EIGHT THOUSAND TO NINE THOUSAND DUCKS EVERY YEAR 
FACTORY FARMS PRODUCE THE SAME NUMBER IN A WEEK 
SO THE FOCUS HERE IS ON QUALITY RATHER THAN QUANTITY AND THE BIRDS HAVE A BETTER LIFE 
THEY SWIRL THEIR TAILS LIKE THE DOGS WOULD DO ARE THEY HAPPY THIS IS A PECULIARITY WITH DUCKS 
THEY ALSO FLAP THEIR WINGS GENTLY AGAINST THEIR BODIES AND A BIT OF A WAGGY TAIL 
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE FEEL GOOD FEELING 
IT'S WHAUGH YOU KNOW 
ATUL WANTED A CLOSER LOOK AND RICHARD WAS HAPPY TO CATCH ONE FOR HIM 
SEE THEY'VE GOT COLOURED EYES THEY HAVE NOT GOT PINK EYES SO THEY ARE NOT ALBINOS 
IT IS JUST A COLOURED DUCK WITH THE GENE THAT MAKES THE FEATHERS COLOURED TURNED OFF 
ALWAYS ORANGE FEET ORANGE FEET AS THEY GET OLDER ALWAYS ORANGE FEET 
SO ATUL HAD FOUND THE REAL THING BUT HE WAS WORRIED THAT HE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT A DYING BREED 
SO RICHARD ARE WE SEEING THE LAST OF THE AYLESBURY DUCK 
THESE ARE THE LAST OF THE UTILITY TYPE 
THAT IS THE MEAT PRODUCING PROPER AYLESBURY DUCK 
THESE ARE REALLY LIVING MUSEUM PIECES TO BE QUITE HONEST 
ABSOLUTELY KEEP IT GOING RICHARD FOR A FEW MORE YEARS WHILE I'M ABLE ANYWAY 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN 
ATUL'S AYLESBURY DUCK BREASTS FRESHLY DELIVERED FROM SMITHFIELD ARE COOKED TO A TEE 
JASON'S CREATING A BONE MARROW JUS FOR HIS BRIOCHE BREADCRUMBS 
BUT IF HE THOUGHT THAT WAS UNUSUAL ATUL'S TRYING TO GO ONE BETTER 
THE COCONUT'S GOING INTO THERE AND THAT IS FOR MY PESTO THE PESTO 
BU IT'S A STRANGE LOOKING KIND OF PESTO 
IT'S ACTUALLY COCONUT CHUTNEY AND LENTIL GIVES A NUTTY FLAVOUR 
SO I FIND IT EASY TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IS THE CONSISTENCY 
IT'S A WILD NAME BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT PESTO IT IS A WILD NAME 
BUT LITERALLY SPEAKING IT'S A PASTE THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS PASTE 
BUT JASON WON'T LET IT LIE 
IF YOU CALL IT THAT THOUGH 
IT'S JUMPING FROM MODERN BRITISH TO ITALIAN TO INDIAN IN ONE EXPLANATION 
THAT'S WHAT MODERN BRITISH IS 
GOOD ANSWER HE'S BLENDING THE COCONUT 
WITH CORIANDER LENTILS CHILLI AND ONION TO MAKE HIS OWN VERSION OF PESTO 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN 
JASON'S ONTO THE POMME PUREE AND HIS SMOKY MILK IS JUST ABOUT READY 
SO NOW IT'S HAD A CHANCE TO REST 
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO AND GET THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER 
YES PLEASE 
M. M. M. SUCH A NICE WOODY FLAVOUR YOU KNOW 
ALMOST GIVES IT THAT BAKED POTATO TYPE TASTE YEAH 
THAT'S SORT OF WHAT I'M AFTER 
SO THE WOODY MILK GOES INTO THE MASH 
BUT THEN ATUL NOTICES THAT JASON'S INTRODUCING A SECRET INGREDIENT 
WHAT ARE YOU ADDING TO YOUR MASH JASON 
IT'S JUST A BIT OF HICKORY ESSENCE BELIEVE IT OR NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE EATING IT 
IT HELPS THEM EASE OFF FEAR BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE FEARING ME A LITTLE BIT 
I THOUGHT I'LL PUT A LITTLE BIT IN THERE IT'LL HELP EASE THE FEAR 
HICKORY ESSENCE TO REDUCE FEAR 
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT 
MAYBE IT'S A WIND UP 
HOW'S THE ICE CREAM DOING ATUL ALL RIGHT YEAH IT LOOKS NICE YOU'VE PULLED IT OFF YEAH 
SO BOTH CHEFS ARE READY AND IT'S TIME TO PLATE UP 
OR IN JASON'S CASE PLATTER UP 
THE OX CHEEK IS PLACED ONTO SMOKED POMME PUREE 
WHILE ATUL'S DUCK IS SLICED AND FANNED OUT OVER HIS PESTO 
THEN JASON ADDS PORTIONS OF HIS TENDER BEEF FILLET 
AS HIS RIVAL SPOONS ICE CREAM ONTO THE MANGO AND PINEAPPLE SALSA 
O. K. READY TO GO 
LOOK AT THAT THAT'S BEAUTIFUL 
BEAUTIFUL YOURS TOO 
SO TODAY'S COOKING IS OVER AND THESE ARE THE MAIN COURSES FOR THE LONDON AND SOUTH EAST HEAT 
JASON'S COOKED UP A RADICAL LOOKING BEEF PATTER WITH SMOKED MASH AND ARTICHOKES 
ATUL'S TRYING TO BEAT HIM WITH A SPICY DUCK BREAST PESTO SALSA 
AND A MODERN FOIE GRAS ICE CREAM 
THE TWO CHEFS WILL SPLIT UP FOR THE TASTING 
SO THEY CAN SPEAK FRANKLY ABOUT THEIR RIVAL'S DISH JASON'S GOING TO TRY ATUL'S FIRST 
WHEN I SAW THAT SLICED 
I WAS WORRIED I THOUGHT THAT LOOKS A BIT RAW TO ME 
BUT BECAUSE THE SPICES OR WHATEVER HE'S PUT IN THE BAG 
HAS SORT OF TENDERISED IT IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS 
MAYBE LIKE TO SEE THE FAT RENDERED DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE SO IT'S NOT QUITE SO FATTY 
BUT IT'S JUST HOW ATUL MEANS IT TO BE 
THE DUCK IS JUST WARM WHEN YOU SERVE IT IT'S NOT HOT IT'S NOT COLD 
IT'S JUST RIGHT FOR YOUR PALATE SO ALL THE FLAVOURS OPEN UP REALLY WELL 
SO WHAT DOES JASON MAKE OF THE ICE CREAM 
ALTHOUGH IT TASTES O. K. AN ICE CREAM SHOULDN'T BE PRODDED LIKE THAT 
AN ICE CREAM SHOULD SORT OF MELT AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS EXPECTING 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A COLD SAUCE IF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 
IT JUST TAKES TASTES MORE LIKE A MOUSSE TO ME 
HAS IT TURNED OUT AS ATUL INTENDED 
THE REASON I CHOSE TO SERVE FOIE GRAS ICE CREAM WAS BECAUSE OF ITS TEXTURE 
IT'S SO LIGHT THAT IT JUST MELTS ON YOUR PALATE 
YOU ACTUALLY FORGET THAT IT WAS MADE LIKE AN ICE CREAM 
IT ALMOST COMES TO YOUR PALATE AS IF IT WAS A PASTE 
BUT DOES HIS RIVAL THINK DUCK WITH ICE CREAM IS TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FOOD 
IT'S NOT A DISH I WOULD WRITE DOWN ON A MENU AND SAY WAS MODERN BRITISH 
BUT IT TASTES SO GOOD WHY NOT 
I'M VERY HAPPY WITH TODAY 
THIS RECIPE HAS COME TOGETHER 
NOW IT'S TIME TO TRY JASON'S MAIN COURSE STRAIGHT AWAY ATUL HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE PRESENTATION 
EXTREMELY MODERN TO PUT IT ON A BLOCK BOARD BUT IT HAS TO BE PRACTICAL AT THE END OF THE DAY 
LET'S NOT FOOL OURSELVES 
THE FOOD WILL GO COLD VERY FAST NO DOUBT ABOUT IT 
GOOD POINT BUT HOW DOES IT TASTE 
STARTING WITH THE ARTICHOKE 
THERE IS NO FLAVOUR IN THERE 
IT'S JUST SITTING THERE IT COULD BE ANYTHING 
SO WHAT DOES JASON MAKE OF IT 
MORE SORT OF VEGETABLE GARNISH THAN INTEGRAL PART OF THE DISH 
THESE TWO BEING THE INTEGRAL PARTS WITH THE DIFFERENT TEXTURES 
AND WHAT DOES HIS RIVAL THINK OF THE OX CHEEKS 
THE CHEEKS ARE COOKED NICELY 
BIT IFFY 
NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE FLAVOURS THERE 
I UNDERSTAND THAT CHEEK WILL HAVE A STRONG FLAVOUR NO DOUBT ABOUT IT 
SITTING ON TOP OF VERY STRONG SMOKED MASH 
I THINK IT'S A BIT TOO MUCH OF A CLASH IN MY OPINION 
BUT THAT IS REALLY A MATTER OF TASTE 
THESE ARE REAL BOLD FLAVOURS 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO IF THIS DISH GET THROUGH SHOW THE GUYS AT THE GHERKIN 
THAT WE DON'T JUST COOK ROAST BEEF AND YORKSHIRE PUDDING AND WE'VE GOT FLAVOURS THAT ARE SPOT ON 
SO WILL THE FILLET REDEEM THE DISH FOR ATUL 
THIS IS THE BUSINESS THIS IS VERY GOOD 
BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF MEAT 
COOKED TO PERFECTION 
WELL WE'LL HEAR WHAT THE JUDGES THINK ABOUT THEIR MAIN COURSES ON FRIDAY 
TOMORROW IT'S THE FINAL ROUND AND JASON SPICES THINGS UP BY PLAYING ATUL AT HIS OWN GAME 
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME IF I'M USING ENOUGH BEING THE MASTER OF SPICE 
DON'T MISS THE DESSERTS ON GREAT BRITISH MENU
