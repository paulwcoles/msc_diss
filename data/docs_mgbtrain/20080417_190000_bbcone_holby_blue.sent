SHE FOUND OUT HER HUSBAND WASN'T GOING TO DIE AFTER ALL SO YOU CHASED HER AND STOPPED HER FROM LEAVING

HE SAID I JUST WANTED HIM TO STOP THE BOY WAS IN A STATE YEAH WELL HE WOULD BE 
HIS FATHER'S LYING IN A POOL OF BLOOD ON THE FLOOR 
BUT MRS. BURROWS TOLD YOU THAT SHE AND HER SON ARE BEATEN NO 
LEE BURROWS DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING SPECIFIC I JUST WANTED HIM TO STOP SINCE THEN HE'S BEEN MUTE 
SINCE HIS MOTHER CORROBORATED HIS FATHER'S VERSION OF EVENTS 
HERE'S A BURNING QUESTION FOR YOU DETECTIVE WHY 
HE'S TRYING TO PROTECT HIS MOTHER WHO'S PUT HER SON IN THE FRAME FOR NEARLY KILLING HIS OLD MAN 
HE KNOWS IF HE TELLS ANYONE WHAT GOES IN THEIR HOUSE HIS MOTHER IS THE ONE WHO'LL SUFFER JOHN 
SHE'S THE ONE WHO'LL GET THE BEATING COS LEE'S NOT THERE TO GET IT WHERE'S YOUR PROOF 
I HAVEN'T GOT ANY I'VE GOT A FEELING MORE THAN A FEELING I CAN SMELL IT I CAN SENSE IT 
GIVE ME SOMETHING TO GO ON I'VE BEEN DOING SOME DIGGING 
IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THEY HAVE MOVED NINE TIMES NINE 
AND I THINK I KNOW THAT THEY'VE MOVED THAT MANY TIMES SO HE DOESN'T GET CAUGHT 
SO NO ONE REALISES WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIS WIFE AND KID 
AND I'M WAITING FOR POLICE REPORTS FROM WHERE THEY'VE LIVED THAT'LL SAY EXACTLY THAT EXACTLY WHAT 
THAT THE LAW STARTS SNIFFING ROUND HIM AND THEY UP STICKS AND MOVE 
LEE BURROWS ATTACKED HIS FATHER FOR A REASON 
IT WASN'T UNPROVOKED HIS MOTHER THE WITNESS SAYS IT WAS 
AND SHE'S ADMITTED THAT SHE LIED GUV IT'S OBVIOUS RIGHT 
THING IS LEE BURROWS WHEN HE WAS FOURTEEN BEAT ANOTHER BOY SENSELESS AND ASSAULTED ONE OF HIS TEACHERS 
AND WHERE DID HE PICK THAT UP FROM YOU LEARN FROM THE HOME GUV 
YOU LEARN FROM THE HOME 
WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SEAN BURROWS PROFESSIONAL GOOD 
WHY IT'S SOUNDING PERSONAL BETWEEN YOU AND BURROWS WHO UNTIL WE KNOW OTHERWISE IS A VICTIM OF ASSAULT 
HE'S NOT A VICTIM OF ANYTHING HE'S A SADIST WHO KICKS THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF HIS WIFE AND CHILD ALLEGEDLY 
SUSPECTED BY YOU AND YOU ALONE WHOSE OFFICE IS THIS 
WELL DID SHE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU COME IN D. S. FRENCH

TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE TOLD JUDY BURROWS HER HUSBAND WAS CONSCIOUS

SHE VOMITED SHE PUKED UP SHE CHUCKED HER GUTS IN FEAR HOW'S THAT FOR SOMETHING TO BE GETTING ON WITH 
SHE'S BEING BEATEN TO A PULP HE'S GOT HER IN THERE I HEARD HER SAY YOU'RE MANIPULATING HER 
PUTTING WORDS INTO HER MOUTH SHE WANTS YOU TO STAY AWAY I'M NOT MANIPULATING HER IT'S HIM
