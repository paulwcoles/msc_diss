THE NINETEEN SIXTIES A DECADE OF ENORMOUS CHANGE 
THE END OF COLONIAL RULE IN AFRICA 
AN ESCALATION OF THE COLD WAR 
AN EXPLOSION OF CULTURE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND WOMEN'S EMANCIPATION 
AND A RACE THAT SENT MANKIND ON ITS GREATEST ADVENTURE 
INTO SPACE 
BUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DECADE HOW DID THE FUTURE LOOK 
IN JANUARY NINETEEN SIXTY A PANORAMA PROGRAMME WAS BROADCAST IN WHICH WORLD LEADERS 
EMINENT SCIENTISTS AND COMMENTATORS 
WERE ASKED HOW THEY THOUGHT THE WORLD MIGHT CHANGE IN THE YEARS AHEAD 
THIS IS A SPECIAL EDITION OF PANORAMA 
IN THE SHORT SPACE OF FORTY FIVE MINUTES WE'RE TRYING TO SHOW SOME 
OF THE SIGNIFICANT TRENDS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS 
WHICH THE WORLD WILL FACE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
THIS PROGRAMME ASKS CURRENT EXPERTS AND DIPLOMATS RICHARD DOWDEN LORD HURD AND SIR BERNARD LOVELL 
WERE THEIR PREDICTIONS RIGHT 
PANORAMA STARTED WITH ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES TO WORLD GOVERNANCE 
THE END OF COLONIAL RULE IN AFRICA 
ROBIN DAY REPORTS 
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE AND MILLIONS LIKE THEM WHO WILL COMMAND WORLD ATTENTION IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS 
THE PEOPLE OF AFRICA MORE AND MORE OF THEM WILL BE ALLOWED TO GOVERN THEMSELVES 
COLONIAL RULE AND THE WHITE SUPREMACY ARE ON THE WAY OUT 
AFRICA ENTERS A DECADE OF TENSION AND UPHEAVAL 
THE AFRICANS YOU SEE HERE ARE LUCKY FOR THEY LIVE IN A PLACE 
WHERE THE RACIAL AND POLITICAL OUTLOOK IS CALM AND CONFIDENT 
THIS IS DAR ES SALAAM CAPITAL OF TANGANYIKA 
THE COFFEE AND DIAMONDS TERRITORY ON THE SWELTERING EAST COAST OF AFRICA 
AND LATER THIS YEAR IN NINETEEN SIXTY THE NINE MILLION PEOPLE OF TANGANYIKA 
NOW ADMINISTERED BY THE BRITISH WILL TAKE THEIR FIRST BIG STEP FORWARD TO SELF GOVERNMENT 
AND THE ENCOURAGING THING IS THAT THEIR AFRICAN LEADER HAS BEEN ABLE TO WIN THIS SWIFT ADVANCE 
WITHOUT VIOLENCE OF ANY SORT AND WITHOUT EVER HAVING BEEN TO PRISON 
HE'S A YOUNG EX SCHOOLMASTER HIS NAME 
JULIUS NYERERE AND HE WILL BE WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS 
TANGANYIKA'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER AND MORE THAN THAT 
THE FIRST BLACK LEADER OF A MULTI RACIAL AFRICAN STATE 
FOR YOU AS A AFRICAN NATIONALIST LEADER WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE CHALLENGE OF THE SIXTIES 
WELL I THINK OBVIOUSLY ONE 
AFRICA IS COMMITTED 
TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE FROM COLONIAL RULE 
AND I THINK THIS NEXT DECADE SHOULD BE THE DECADE 
IN WHICH WE SHOULD REALLY GET THE WHOLE OF AFRICA FREE 
WELL BY THE END OF THE DECADE MOST OF AFRICA WAS FREE 
THE PORTUGUESE STAYED ON IN ANGOLA MOZAMBIQUE AND GUINEA BISSAU 
BUT FRANCE BRITAIN AND SPAIN ALL PULLED OUT OF THEIR 
THEIR AFRICAN POSSESSIONS AND ER IT WAS 
IT WAS JUST THE PORTUGUESE COLONIES AND OF COURSE SOUTH AFRICA 
AND RHODESIA WHICH WHERE WHITE RULE STILL PREVAILED AND 
THE REST OF AFRICA WAS INDEPENDENT BY NINETEEN SEVENTY 
I THINK MOST PEOPLE IN THE FOREIGN OFFICE RECOGNISED THAT NYERERE 
WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT INDEPENDENCE WAS COMING IT WAS INEVITABLE 
I THINK THE COLONIAL EMPIRES 
NO LONGER HAD EITHER THE WILL OR THE MEANS TO HANG ON 
TO COLONIES IN AFRICA AGAINST THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE THERE 
THE MAIN EXTERNAL POWER DRIVING THE BRITISH WAS AMERICA 
THEY HAD LENT BRITAIN A GREAT DEAL THEY SUDDENLY CALLED IN THE DEBT NOW AND A PART OF THE PRICE OF 
ACTUALLY THEN LENDING BRITAIN MORE MONEY WAS THAT IT SHOULD GIVE UP ITS EMPIRE 
THE WAR IN ALGERIA HAD ALREADY STARTED AGAINST THE FRENCH 
THE BRITISH HAD HAD A TASTE AGAINST OF IT AGAINST 
MAU MAU IN KENYA THIS UPRISING IN KENYA AND THEIR CHOICE WAS VERY SIMPLE 
YOU EITHER SHOOT OR YOU GET OUT 
HAROLD MACMILLAN BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER 
FAMOUSLY SUMMED UP THE PREVAILING MOOD JUST A FEW WEEKS LATER AT SOUTH AFRICA'S PARLIAMENT IN CAPE TOWN 
THE MOST STRIKING OF ALL THE IMPRESSIONS I HAVE FORMED SINCE I LEFT LONDON A MONTH AGO 
IS OF THE STRENGTH 
OF THIS AFRICAN NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS 
IT IS HAPPENING EVERYWHERE 
THE WIND OF CHANGE IS BLOWING THROUGH THE CONTINENT 
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE CHOSE CAPE TOWN 
I MEAN IT WAS IT SEEMED QUITE BIZARRE 
IF HE'D MADE IT IN ANY OTHER AFRICAN CAPITAL HE'D HAVE BEEN CHEERED AND 
AND IT WAS THE ONE PLACE WHERE HE GOT A REALLY REALLY BAD REACTION 
AND OF COURSE IT TOOK ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR YEARS BEFORE SOUTH AFRICA ACTUALLY BECAME FREE ANYWAY 
SEVERAL MONTHS LATER THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT SHOWED THE WORLD 
THE LENGTHS IT WAS PREPARED TO GO TO IN ORDER TO HOLD ONTO POWER 
RICHARD DIMBLEBY INTRODUCED THE STORY FOR PANORAMA THAT MARCH 
FROM TIME TO TIME IN HISTORY THE NAME OF AN INSIGNIFICANT PLACE 
BURNS ITSELF INTO THE MEMORY OF MANKIND SIMPLY BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED THERE 
PLACES LIKE GUERNICA AND LIDICE 
AND BELSEN HOLA AND LITTLE ROCK 
AND TODAY THERE MAY WELL BE ANOTHER SHARPEVILLE NEAR JOHANNESBURG IN SOUTH AFRICA 
MORE THAN SIXTY AFRICANS INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE KILLED 
AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY WERE INJURED A WEEK AGO TODAY 
WHEN THE POLICE OPENED FIRE ON A CROWD ESTIMATED 
AT TWENTY THOUSAND WHICH HAD SURROUNDED SHARPEVILLE POLICE STATION 
THE SHOOTINGS HAPPENED DURING A DEMONSTRATION AGAINST THE SO CALLED 
PASS LAWS THE HOSPITALS OF SHARPEVILLE ARE STILL DEALING WITH THE INJURED 
ALREADY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS OFFICIALLY REGRETTED 
WHAT IT CALLED A TRAGIC LOSS OF LIFE 
AND THIS WEEK THE SECURITY COUNCIL WILL DISCUSS THE SHOOTINGS 
ROBIN DAY ALSO INTERVIEWED WHITE SOUTH AFRICAN'S WHO WERE LIVING IN LONDON 
SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK 
THE POLICE SHOT DOWN INNOCENT DEMONSTRATORS PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATORS 
WELL ANYONE WHO'S SEEN A CROWD OF NATIVES OR AFRICANS 
IN SOUTH AFRICA PEACEFULLY DEMONSTRATE 
WILL NEVER FORGET IT IT'S AN UNFORGETTABLE SIGHT I CAN ASSURE YOU 
HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT THE BRITISH AND WORLD REACTION TO THE SHARPEVILLE SHOOTINGS LAST WEEK 
I DON'T THINK THE POLICE COULD HAVE ACTED ANY OTHER WAY 
AND FOR THAT REASON I THINK THE REACTION WAS VERY VERY STRONG 
WITHOUT HAVING BEEN THERE IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE TO SAY 
DO YOU THINK THE USE OF SUB MACHINE GUNS WAS NECESSARY 
WHAT ELSE COULD HE HAVE DONE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO GET HIMSELF OUT OF THE POLICE STATION 
ADMITTEDLY HE COULD HAVE FIRED A WARNING VOLLEY BEFOREHAND WHICH HE DIDN'T DO 
AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE TO OPEN FIRE AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD 
I FEEL THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT MORE BLOODSHED IN THE UNION 
A BACKLASH AGAINST WHITES WAS SOMETHING MANY EXPECTED FROM INDEPENDENCE 
AND HOW CAN YOU COMBINE AFRICAN SELF GOVERNMENT WITH 
REAL LASTING SAFEGUARDS FOR WHITE MINORITIES AND ASIAN MINORITIES 
I DON'T SEE WHY IN INDEPENDENT AFRICA A EUROPEAN AN ASIAN AN ARAB 
OR A MEMBER OF ANY OTHER MINORITY COMMUNITY SHOULD NOT 
AS AN INDIVIDUAL BE ACCEPTED AS A CITIZEN OF THE COUNTRY 
AND THAT TO ME IS REALLY THE GREATEST SAFEGUARD 
BUT SOME OF THE WHITE SETTLERS PARTICULARLY IN KENYA SEEM NERVOUS ABOUT THIS 
I KNOW THEY'RE NERVOUS I KNOW THEY'RE NERVOUS FOR TWO THINGS 
ONE I THINK IS ONE I HAVE SAID WHERE THEY THINK THE DEMAND FOR INDEPENDENCE IS EQUIVALENT 
TO A DESIRE TO GET RID OF THE WHITE MAN FROM KENYA WHICH IS NOT TRUE 
THE OTHER ONE I MAY BE FORGIVEN TO SAY THIS 
THE OTHER ONE I THINK IS A GUILTY CONSCIENCE THAT THE AFRICAN MIGHT RETALIATE 
YES THERE WAS GREAT FEAR AMONG AMONG WHITE PEOPLE WORKING IN 
AFRICA COLONIAL ADMINISTRATORS 
AND SO ON THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME TERRIBLE UPRISING AFTERWARDS 
AND IN MOST OF AFRICA IT NEVER HAPPENED ON THE CONTRARY 
THEY WERE THEY WERE LEFT ALONE AND THERE WERE VERY FEW REPORTS OF 
OF PEOPLE BEING ATTACKED OR 
OR ROBBED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
BUT IN CONGO 
THAT'S WHERE IT WENT WRONG 
AT FIRST BLACK AND WHITE WERE EQUAL VICTIMS OF INDISCRIMINATE LOOTING RAPE AND KILLING 
SOON ALL HATREDS TURNED ON THE BELGIAN SETTLERS 
IN THE CITIES THEIR HOUSES AND POSSESSIONS WERE DESTROYED 
IN ISOLATED POSTS IN THE VILLAGES AND THE MISSIONS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE CONGO THERE WAS MURDER 
THERE WAS THEN A CIVIL WAR AND A LARGE GROUP OF WHITES WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE MANY OF THEM WERE KILLED 
AND I THINK THAT WAS THE BIG SHOCK 
BUT IN FACT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN 
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYWHERE ELSE IN AFRICA WHERE IT HAPPENED ON ANY SCALE AT ALL 
AND WHAT IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR THE NEW AFRICAN STATES 
I THINK THERE ARE GOING TO BE TWO MAIN PROBLEMS 
ONE IS THE USUAL ONE OF ESTABLISHING STABLE STATES 
AND THE OTHER ONE OF COURSE IS ONE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT IN TERRITORIES 
WHICH HAVE SO LONG BEEN DEPENDENT ON WHITE SKILL AND ADMINISTRATION 
AND CAPITAL ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU CAN RUN YOUR OWN AFFAIRS 
I'M CERTAIN MYSELF 
I THINK ROBIN DAY WAS THINKING THAT THERE WAS A. 
A LACK OF EXPERIENCE THAT IN MOST OF THESE COUNTRIES THERE'D NOT 
BEEN VERY MUCH TRAINING NOT VERY MUCH PREPARATION FOR INDEPENDENCE 
MOST OF THE FRENCH COLONIES KEPT ON A HUGE WHITE FRENCH STAFF 
AND THAT CONTINUED WAY WELL IT CONTINUED IN SOME WAYS TO THIS DAY 
NYERERE HIMSELF AS HE SAYS 
I'M NOT ABOUT DRIVING WHITE PEOPLE OUT OF AFRICA IT'S JUST THAT WE HAVE TO RULE AFRICA NOT THE WHILE PEOPLE 
AND HE WAS QUITE KEEN ON HAVING QUITE A LOT OF WHITE BRITISH STAFF AROUND HIM AS WELL 
HIS SECRETARY WAS A BRITISH WOMAN 
COULD WESTERN DEMOCRACY WORK FOR THESE NEWLY INDEPENDENT NATIONS IN AFRICA 
HOW CAN AFRICAN INDEPENDENCE SUCH AS YOU ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE PROBABLY WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS 
BE PREVENTED FROM BECOMING A DICTATORSHIP BY THE MAJORITY 
HOW COULD YOU MAKE DEMOCRACY REALLY WORK IN OTHER WORDS 
DEMOCRACY CAN ONLY WORK WHEN A PEOPLE WANT TO WORK IT 
I CAN'T SAY MYSELF QUITE FRANKLY THAT THERE IS A FORMULA 
THERE IS SOME MAGIC WHICH ONCE APPLIED DEMOCRACY IS GOING TO WORK 
DEMOCRACY WORKS IS MADE TO WORK BY THE PEOPLE 
AND LET ME SAY I HAVE NOTICED NOTHING IN AFRICA WHICH 
HAS REDUCED MY FAITH THAT DEMOCRACY WILL WORK IN AFRICA 
THERE NYERERE I THINK WAS WRONG 
HE SAYS THAT THE PEOPLE WILL MAKE IT WORK 
BUT THE PEOPLE WERE EXCLUDED FROM DEMOCRACY IN AFRICA FROM GOVERNMENT 
I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN AFRICA ESSENTIALLY WAS TWO THINGS 
ONE WAS THE ARMIES TOOK OVER IN A SERIES OF COUP 
TWENTY ONE COUPS IN THAT FIRST DECADE 
THE OTHER IS THAT I THINK BEST DESCRIBED BY CHINUA ACHEBE QUITE 
EARLY ON I THINK ABOUT NINETEEN SIXTY THREE HE WROTE IT IN HIS NOVEL A MAN OF THE PEOPLE 
AND HE SAYS THE COLONIALISTS HAVE BUILT THIS HOUSE 
AND WE WERE ALL OUT IN THE RAIN US AFRICANS WERE ALL OUT IN THE RAIN 
AND SUDDENLY THE 
WHITE MAN SAID HE WAS LEAVING THIS HOUSE AND WE ALL RAN TOWARDS IT 
AND HE SAYS THE SMART THE LUCKY BUT NOT ALWAYS THE BEST RUSHED INTO IT AND SLAMMED THE DOORS 
AND BARRICADED THEMSELVES IN AND THEN ANNOUNCED THAT ALL AGITATION SHOULD CEASE BECAUSE OTHERWISE 
THE HOUSE WOULD FALL DOWN AND THEY'VE STAYED IN THERE AND WE'VE BEEN OUT IN THE RAIN EVER SINCE 
IT'S ONE THING FOR COUNTRIES TO BECOME INDEPENDENT 
IT'S ANOTHER THING TO PROVE TO USE NYERERE'S PHRASE THAT DEMOCRACY WORKS IN AFRICA 
UM I DON'T THINK THAT'S PROVEN YET 
SO WE CAN'T YET SAY HAND ON HEART THAT WE KNOW THAT DEMOCRACY WORKS IN AFRICA WHAT I THINK WE CAN 
WHAT HAS BEEN PROVED IS THAT NOTHING ELSE WORKS AND SO THEREFORE THEY HAVE TO MOVE ON 
THEY ARE MOVING ON SLOWLY TOWARDS ER DEMOCRACY THAT WORKS 
IT'S THE ONLY IT'S THE ONLY WAY 
NYERERE BECAME PRIME MINISTER OF THE FIRST GOVERNMENT OF INDEPENDENT TANGANYIKA IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE AND THE FOLLOWING 
YEAR HE WAS VOTED PRESIDENT IN THE NEWLY DECLARED REPUBLIC 
BY NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR TANGANIKA WAS UNITED WITH ZANZIBAR AND BECAME KNOWN AS TANZANIA 
NYERERE NEVER LET POWER GO TO HIS HEAD 
HE WAS ALWAYS A VERY MODEST MAN HE LIVED A VERY MODEST LIFE 
HE DRESSED VERY SIMPLY HE SPOKE VERY SIMPLY 
AND HE IS I THINK ONE OF THE HEROES THAT EMERGE FROM THAT PERIOD 
ALTHOUGH HIS GRASS ROOTS SOCIALIST IDEA FAILED 
I THINK TANZANIA IS ONE COUNTRY WHERE THERE IS MORE EQUALITY 
OR HAS BEEN MORE EQUALITY THAN IN OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES 
AND THAT THERE IS A GREAT SENSE OF PRIDE 
IN TANZANIA WHICH OTHER SOME OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES DON'T HAVE 
I DO ATTRIBUTE THAT TO NYERERE'S VISION AND HIS OWN RATHER MODEST PERSONALITY 
FROM AFRICA PANORAMA TURNED ITS ATTENTION TO INDIA 
THE CHALLENGE THAT FACES INDIA TODAY IS HOW TO NOURISH HER OWN ENORMOUS POPULATION AND HOW TO MAINTAIN HER 
POSITION AS A BIG NEUTRAL POWER BETWEEN EAST AND WEST 
JAMES MOSSMAN IN NEW DELHI ASKS PANDIT NEHRU THE PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA 
WHETHER THE COLD WAR WILL CONTINUE TO THE SIXTIES 
I SHOULD THINK NOT 
IT WOULD BE A VERY BAD THING IF IT LASTED 
ALREADY THERE ARE SOME SIGNS OF IT GETTING LESS 
WHEN IT WILL ENTIRELY CEASE IS DIFFICULT TO SAY 
BUT I THINK PROGRESSIVELY IT'LL GET LESS AND LESS 
WELL THE TRUTH IS THAT 
THE COLD WAR WENT ON FOR ANOTHER THIRTY YEARS 
AND THAT IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF JANUARY NINETEEN SIXTY 
FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS OR SO IT GOT WORSE AND WORSE 
HE WAS A BIT OPTIMISTIC NEHRU BECAUSE TWO YEARS LATER 
WE HAD THE BIGGEST SINGLE CRISIS OF THE COLD WAR WHICH WAS THE CUBA MISSILE CRISIS 
THERE WAS A MOVE TO CREATE A NON ALIGNED MOVEMENT WHICH WOULD STAND BETWEEN EAST AND WEST 
NOT INVOLVED ON EITHER SIDE IN THE COLD WAR AND INDIA WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MEMBERS 
OF THAT GROUP AND NEHRU WAS A REVERED LEADER OF INDIA 
AND OF THE DEVELOPING AND THE NON ALIGNED WORLD 
WHAT MAJOR CONCESSIONS DO YOU THINK THAT EITHER SAY AMERICA OR RUSSIA COULD MAKE IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS 
MAJOR CONCESSIONS HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF A PARTICULAR PROBLEM 
FOR INSTANCE NOW THEY ARE DEALING WITH EUROPEAN PROBLEMS GERMANY ET CETERA 
I DON'T KNOW AND I REALLY CAN'T SAY WHAT CONCESSIONS THE REAL THING IS 
IF THEY COULD GET RID OF THE FEAR 
THAT THE OTHER WILL ATTACK THEM 
ONCE THEY GET RID OF THAT FEAR THE REST BECOMES RELATIVELY EASY 
BUT IT WASN'T GOING TO BE EASY 
JUST MONTHS LATER IN MAY THE WORLD WAS SHOWN PICTURES OF THE WRECKAGE 
OF AN AMERICAN U. TWO SPY PLANE SHOT DOWN WHILE FLYING OVER SOVIET AIRSPACE 
INITIALLY THE U. S. CLAIMED IT HAD ACCIDENTALLY ENCROACHED ON THE TERRITORY 
BUT FINALLY PRESIDENT EISENHOWER ADMITTED IT HAD BEEN ON A SPYING MISSION 
NO ONE WANTS ANOTHER PEARL HARBOUR 
THIS MEANS THAT WE MUST HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF MILITARY FORCES 
AND PREPARATIONS AROUND THE WORLD 
ESPECIALLY OF THOSE CAPABLE OF MASSIVE SURPRISE ATTACKS 
THEN THERE WAS A SERIES OF ULTIMATUMS BY KHRUSHCHEV 
TRYING TO GET THE WEST OUT OF BERLIN 
IT WAS ONLY WHEN WE HAD STOOD UP TO THAT SUCCESSFULLY THAT THEY LOOKED 
FOR OTHER MEANS OF PREVENTING THE HAEMORRHAGE OF SKILLED PEOPLE 
OUT OF EAST BERLIN INTO THE WEST 
ACROSS THE UNCLOSED BORDER BETWEEN THE EASTERN AND THE WESTERN SECTORS 
THE BERLIN WALL WAS A SYMBOL OF A KIND OF GOVERNMENT 
WHICH HAD TO KEEP ITS OWN CITIZENS IN AND COULD ONLY DO THAT BY FORCE 
BUT AT OTHER PARTS OF THE BORDER THE WEST BERLINERS CAN GET RIGHT UP CLOSE TO THE WALL 
THEY STAND AND WAVE TO DISTANT FIGURES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO RELATIVES OR 
FRIENDS IF THEY CAN PICK THEM OUT OR MERELY AS ONE OF THEM SAID TO ME 
TO CHEER THE EAST BERLINERS UP AND SHOW THAT THEY ARE NOT FORGOTTEN 
IT WAS A BRUTAL WALL AND PEOPLE BEING SHOT TRYING TO CROSS IT IT COULDN'T 
THE TRUTH THERE ABOUT THE SYSTEM WAS SYMBOLISED IN A WAY WHICH NO ONE COULD REALLY GAINSAY 
AND THEN ER THERE WAS THE CUBA CRISIS 
IN OCTOBER NINETEEN SIXTY TWO AMERICAN SPY PLANES PHOTOGRAPHED A BUILD UP 
OF SOVIET MISSILE BASES ON CUBA JUST NINETY MILES OFF THE U. S. COAST 
OVER THE NEXT TWO WEEKS THERE WAS AN INCREASE OF TENSION 
WHICH MANY THOUGHT WOULD TRIGGER THE WORLD'S FIRST NUCLEAR WAR 
AS THE ALERT IS STEPPED UP MISSILES AND ROCKETS ARE SLUNG UNDER THE WINGS OF BOMBERS AND FIGHTERS 
TO READY THEM IF THE GO SIGNAL IS GIVEN 
THE SITUATION REACHED FEVER PITCH 
GOOD EVENING MY FELLOW CITIZENS 
THIS GOVERNMENT AS PROMISED 
HAS MAINTAINED THE CLOSEST SURVEILLANCE OF THE SOVIET MILITARY BUILD UP ON THE ISLAND OF CUBA 
WITHIN THE PAST WEEK UNMISTAKEABLE EVIDENCE HAS ESTABLISHED THE FACT 
THAT A SERIES OF OFFENSIVE MISSILE SITES IS NOW IN PREPARATION ON THAT IMPRISONED ISLAND 
THE PURPOSE OF THESE BASES CAN BE NONE OTHER THAN TO 
PROVIDE A NUCLEAR STRIKE CAPABILITY AGAINST THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE 
I WAS A STUDENT I WATCHED THE SPEECH 
I THINK LIKE ALL PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD I WAS NERVOUS 
PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT FRIGHTENED 
I THINK THAT WE ALL KNEW HOW IMPORTANT THE STAKES WERE 
IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE U. S. GOVERNMENT WAS NOT GOING TO ALLOW 
THE CONTINUATION OF THOSE MISSILES IN CUBA 
STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND B. FIFTY TWO BOMBERS ALREADY ON A MASSIVE WORLDWIDE AIRBORNE ALERT 
ARE NOW FLYING A TWENTY FOUR HOUR MISSION THE WORLD AWAITS THE OUTCOME 
I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY THE EVENING OF THE CRITICAL NIGHT 
AND STAYED ON THROUGH THE NIGHT HELPING WITH THE TRANSLATION OF KHRUSHCHEV MESSAGES TO KENNEDY 
BUT IT WAS QUITE CLEAR TO ALL OF US IN MOSCOW THAT THIS CRISIS WAS THE WORST THE MOST DANGEROUS 
THAT THERE HAD BEEN AND THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE REALLY DID EXIST 
IN OTHER WORDS PUTTING IT PERSONALLY THAT AMERICAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
COULD HAVE LANDED ON THE HEADS OF WESTERNERS LIVING IN MOSCOW 
IT WAS REALLY CONSIDERED AN AFFRONT TO US TO HAVE THESE MISSILES ARMED WITH NUCLEAR WARHEADS 
SO CLOSE TO OUR ONLY NINETY MILES FROM THE FLORIDA MAINLAND 
SO BUT IT WAS A REAL THREAT AND I THINK PEOPLE WERE WORRIED 
AT THE END OF ER A LONG NIGHT FOLLOWING ALL THAT 
SOMEWHERE BEFORE DAWN I WENT OUT WITH MY WIFE INTO MOSCOW 
TO HAVE A LOOK ROUND BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SEE WHETHER 
THE ORDINARY PEOPLE ON THEIR WAY TO WORK WERE BEHAVING NORMALLY 
AND IN FACT THERE WERE NO BREAD QUEUES NONE OF THE QUEUES YOU WOULD PARTICULARLY HAVE EXPECTED IF PEOPLE 
WERE WORRIED AND GOING TO HOARD THINGS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT A GREAT BIG CRISIS WAS COMING 
AT NINE A M. ON OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTH A MESSAGE FROM KHRUSHCHEV WAS BROADCAST ON RADIO MOSCOW 
HE AGREED TO WITHDRAW THE MISSILES FROM CUBA 
IT APPEARED TO BE A COMPLETE CAPITULATION BUT WHAT WASN'T PUBLICLY KNOWN AT THE TIME 
WAS THAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY HAD ALSO WITHDRAWN U. S. MISSILES FROM TURKEY 
THE WORLD HAD COME THE CLOSEST IT EVER HAS TO NUCLEAR WAR 
THE MOST IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE TO US IN THE WEST MUST COME FROM SOVIET RUSSIA 
NOW WE HAVE NO DIRECT BROADCASTS FROM RUSSIA TONIGHT BUT NOT FOR WANT OF TRYING 
BUT IN THE STUDIO EDWARD CRANKSHAW WHO IS THE OBSERVER'S EXPERT ON THE SOVIET UNION 
IS DISCUSSING WITH ROBERT KEYE WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR RUSSIA 
HOW RIGHT ARE WE IN ASSUMING THAT WHEREAS IT WAS THE RUSSIANS IN THE 
FORMS OF KHRUSHCHEV AND STALIN OF COURSE MUSTN'T FORGET HIM 
WHO DOMINATED THE FIFTIES IT WILL BE THE CHINESE IN THE FORM OF MAO WHO DOMINATES THE SIXTIES 
OH I THINK IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK IN TERMS OF DECADES ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
NOT SO MUCH MAO AS SUCH BUT THE GREAT PROBLEM OF THE SIXTIES ARE GOING TO BE THE CHINESE RELATIONS 
WITH THE RUSSIANS AND WITH OURSELVES 
WELL CHINA AND RUSSIA UM 
SORT OF LIVED UNEASILY SIDE BY SIDE 
THEY ER WERE BOTH COMMUNIST COUNTRIES 
ER THE RUSSIANS WANTED TO HELP ER ER CHINA 
BUT THE CHINESE IN A WAY BROKE AWAY SO IT WAS AN UNEASY TIME 
THERE IS AN IDEOLOGICAL RIVALRY KHRUSHCHEV BEGINNING 
TO AMEND ER MARXISM LENINISM 
AFTER THE DEATH OF STALIN TRYING TO PUT HIS OWN STAMP ON IT 
REFORMING AWAY FROM STALIN'S WAYS 
AND CHINA STICKING MORE TO THE OLD RIGID ORTHODOXY 
SO THERE WAS THAT RIVALRY 
AND THEN THERE WAS A RATHER UNSTABLE BORDER THE USSURI RIVER 
WAS WHERE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS 
THERE WAS A BURST OF MILITARY INCIDENTS ACROSS THE RIVER 
AND THE SINO SOVIET DISPUTE WHICH HAD BEEN RUMBLING ALONG 
MORE ON AN IDEOLOGICAL LEVEL SUDDENLY TURNED INTO AN INTERSTATE CRISIS 
AND UM THAT WAS THE COMING OUT IF YOU LIKE 
OF THE SINO SOVIET DISPUTE 
WHICH CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE SIXTIES AND BEYOND 
THEY WERE RIVALS AND FROM THAT MOMENT OVERTLY RIVALS 
WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC BATTLE PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT OF COURSE 
IN TEN YEARS' TIME THE RUSSIANS WILL BE PUSHING US OUT OF WORLD MARKETS AND THAT SORT OF THING 
ARE THE CHINESE GOING TO COMPETE WITH THE RUSSIANS IN THAT TOO OR WHAT 
OH NOT IN THIS DECADE I MEAN ENOUGH FOR TEN YEARS IS ENOUGH 
AND I DON'T THINK THE CHINESE FROM WHAT ONE HEARS ARE GOING TO REACH THAT STAGE 
SO IT'S THE RUSSIANS REALLY WHO ARE THE GREAT ECONOMIC ENEMIES AS IT WERE OF THE SIXTIES WOULD YOU SAY 
YES THE RUSSIANS ARE OUR CHALLENGE AND THEY CAN BE QUITE A STIMULATING CHALLENGE 
THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY HIGHLY SORT OF REGIMENTED 
WAS ACTUALLY IN A POOR WAY 
WAS NOT MAKING THE KIND OF PROGRESS WHICH WE IN THE WEST WERE MAKING 
CRANKSHAW DOESN'T SEEM QUITE TO HAVE GRASPED THAT 
BUT I DO REMEMBER WE WERE VERY MUCH IMPRESSED BY THE SPUTNIK BY THE 
AND THEY WERE VERY GOOD AT PUTTING THIS ACROSS IN THEIR PROPAGANDA SO WE GOT A RATHER 
AND I THINK THIS SHOWS IN WHAT CRANKSHAW WAS SAYING 
WE GOT RATHER EXAGGERATED IDEA OF HOW STRONG THEY WERE ECONOMICALLY 
BY THE END OF THAT DECADE I THINK THEY WERE SLOWING DOWN A LOT 
AND THE WEST WAS GOING AHEAD FASTER SO THE GAP WAS GROWING 
NOT DIMINISHING FROM ABOUT NINETEEN SEVENTY ONWARDS 
ECONOMIC RIVALRY BETWEEN EAST AND WEST WASN'T THE ONLY CONCERN AT THAT TIME 
THERE WAS ALSO THE QUESTION OF THE NEWLY INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES IN AFRICA AND ASIA 
THE SO CALLED NON COMMITTED OR NON ALIGNED NATIONS 
THE QUESTION WAS WHICH OF THE BIG POWERS EAST OR WEST COULD ATTRACT THEIR ALLEGIANCE 
THEY'RE NOT MERELY ADDRESSING THEMSELVES TO US IN COMPETITION 
THEY'RE TRYING TO WIN SOME KIND OF MORAL LEADERSHIP THROUGH ECONOMIC AID 
OVER THE 
THESE SORT OF PEOPLE THOSE SORT OF PEOPLE UNCOMMITTED NATIONS 
AND THE CHINESE I SHOULD SAY ARE GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN THEM TOO 
AND IT'LL BE KHRUSHCHEV'S JOB TO KEEP HIS END UP AS THE SENIOR COMMUNIST 
WHEN HE REALLY WANTS TO RELAX A LITTLE AND FORGET A LITTLE ABOUT COMMUNISM 
AND GET ON WITH ECONOMIC STUFF AT HOME YEAH 
SO IT'LL BE HERE WITH THE UNCOMMITTED NATIONS 
THAT THE REAL BATTLE BETWEEN CHINA AND RUSSIA TAKES PLACE I THINK VERY LARGELY 
THE RUSSIANS USED ECONOMIC POLICY AS WELL AS MILITARY PRESSURE 
TO GET THEMSELVES FRIENDS 
AND THEY WERE HELPED BY THE MISTAKES OF THE WEST 
AND IN AFRICA THEY ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES QUITE SUCCESSFULLY IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES 
SO THE QUESTION FOR ALL THE AFRICAN GOVERNMENT 
WAS WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON 
MOST OF THEM TRIED TO STEER A. 
COURSE BETWEEN THE TWO AND NOT COME DOWN ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER 
BUT IN REALITY THEY WERE EITHER PROPPED UP BY ER 
BY AMERICA AND THE WEST OR THE 
THE SOVIET UNION WITH CHINA TRYING TO COME IN AS WELL 
BUT NOW OF COURSE WE'RE TALKING AS IF KHRUSHCHEV'S ONLY AND MAO'S ONLY INTERESTS 
ARE GOING TO BE ABROAD WITH THE AFRICANS AND OTHER ASIANS 
THE UNCOMMITTED NATIONS BUT SURELY I MEAN EVEN DICTATORS HAVE TO THINK MAINLY OF LIFE AT HOME DON'T THEY 
BUT HIS REAL INTERESTS ARE AT HOME IN SUPPLYING THIS SORT OF STUFF 
OH THAT KIND OF STUFF I THINK HE'S GOT BEYOND NOW 
AFTER ALL SAID AND DONE THE RUSSIANS ARE GETTING AS BORED WITH THAT KIND OF PHOTOGRAPH 
AS WE ARE AND THERE'S EVERY SIGN THAT MR. KHRUSHCHEV REALISES IT 
LET'S MOVE ON IF WE'RE FEELING LIKE THIS ABOUT HIM 
BUT YOU MEAN REALLY THAT THERE'S SOMETHING MORE 
THAN JUST SUPPLYING TRUCKS AND TELEVISION SETS TO THE RUSSIANS FOR KHRUSHCHEV 
IT'S A WORRY IT'S A COMPLICATED THING HE'S GOT TO DO AT HOME 
WELL THE WHOLE SOVIET MESSAGE WAS THAT WESTERN FREEDOM 
WAS VERY SECOND RATE 
BECAUSE IT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A LOT OF INEQUALITY AND UNFAIRNESS 
THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM AND HERE BY CONTRAST 
WAS THE SOVIET UNION IN WHICH EVERYONE WAS AT WORK 
EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY BECAUSE THEY WERE AT WORK AND EVERYBODY WAS TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED 
SO SMILING FACES ON TRACTORS SMILING FACES IN POWER STATIONS 
AND THIS PROPAGANDA MESSAGE IT HAD ITS EFFECT 
PARTICULARLY WHEN THE WEST WAS GOING THROUGH DIFFICULT PERIODS IT HAD ITS AFFECT THESE SMILING FACES 
WHICH WERE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN EXHIBITIONS 
AND EVERYTHING AND MANY PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WERE DECEIVED BY IT 
I BELIEVE THAT THE IDEOLOGY STILL HAD POTENCY 
AND STILL GAVE PEOPLE HOPE OF A BETTER LIFE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SIXTIES 
AND BY THE END OF THE SIXTIES THAT WAS DIMINISHING IN THE SEVENTIES IT HAD GONE 
THERE IS AN EXPERIENCE OF MY OWN 
WHICH SHOWS WHAT I MEAN 
IF YOU WENT INTO AND I DID INTO GUM THE MAIN DEPARTMENT STORE IN MOSCOW 
IN THE EARLY SIXTIES AND ASKED FOR A PRODUCT THEY DIDN'T HAVE WHAT THE GIRL WOULD SAY 
WITH A SMILE WOULD HAVE BEEN A RUSSIAN WORD WHICH MEANS IT WILL BE 
IN OTHER WORDS WE SHALL HAVE THAT IN DUE COURSE THERE WAS HOPE 
BY THE MID SEVENTIES WHEN WE WERE LIVING IN MOSCOW AGAIN IF YOU WENT TO THE SAME SHOP 
AND ASKED FOR THE SAME PRODUCT THEY STILL DIDN'T HAVE IT THEY DIDN'T SAY IT WILL BE 
THEY SAID HAVEN'T GOT IT INDIFFERENT SHRUG SHOULDER SHRUGGING NEGATIVE 
SO THAT SMILE MAY WEAR OFF HIS FACE AS THE SIXTIES GO ON 
NO IT WON'T HE'S A PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN OF A HIGHLY GIFTED KIND 
NO POLITICIAN'S EVER ALLOWED THE SMILE TO WEAR OFF HIS FACE 
KHRUSHCHEV WAS OUSTED IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR 
SO IF HE'D EVER HAD A SMILE ON HIS FACE IT WOULD HAVE GONE AT THAT MOMENT 
AND HE WAS A MAN WHO WAS IMPETUOUS AND INCONSISTENT 
RATHER BRILLIANT BUT RATHER RISKY TOO 
AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT HE WAS OUSTED BY A SERIES OF DULL PEOPLE AROUND HIM 
AND SO THE SOVIET UNION SETTLED DOWN IN THE MID SIXTIES TO BEING A STEADIER PERFORMER IN THE WORLD 
UM SMILE WAS KHRUSHCHEV 
STEADINESS AND PERHAPS EVEN DIGNITY WAS BREZHNEV 
AND FOR THE WORLD'S PEACE THE LATTER WAS SAFER 
FOR A VIEW OF THE PROBLEMS THAT EUROPE WILL BE FACING IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS 
WE GO NOW TO FRANCE TO THE ECONOMIST AND PHILOSOPHER BERTRAND DE JOUVENAL 
FIRSTLY IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT WE MUST ASSUME BY OURSELVES 
IN AN ADULT MANNER THE BURDEN OF OUR DEFENCE THUS RELIEVING OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS 
I DO HOPE THAT THE SIXTIES WILL SEE THE PURSUIT 
OF THE HIGH PACE OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS WHICH OCCURRED IN THE FIFTIES 
I ALSO HOPE THAT ENGLAND SHALL STEP UP HER OWN RATE BY CLOSER ASSOCIATION 
WITH THE COUNTRIES WHICH NOW FORM THE CONTINENTAL COMMON MARKET 
I ALSO HOPE THAT THIS CLOSER ASSOCIATION SHALL COMBAT THE TENDENCIES TO BE FEARED 
TOWARDS THE REVIVAL OF NATIONALISM THE GREAT AND DANGEROUS PASSION OF OUR TIMES 
JOUVENAL SAID SOMETHING RATHER IRONICAL 
BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO TRIED TO SAY 
THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS COUNTRY'S DEFENCE 
AND THAT WAS NONE OTHER THAN GENERAL DE GAULLE 
WHO LEFT THE NATO DEFENCE ARRANGEMENTS 
SHORTLY AFTER THOSE REMARKS BY DE JOUVENAL 
DE GAULLE KNEW EXTREMELY WELL THAT AMERICA COULD NOT ALLOW 
WESTERN EUROPE TO FALL UNDER SOVIET INFLUENCE 
AND THAT NATO WOULD CONTINUE TO EXIST 
AND CONTINUE TO DETER SOVIET AGGRESSION FOR THAT REASON 
AND THEREFORE THAT FRENCH SECURITY WOULD BE LOOKED AFTER ANYWAY 
WITHOUT FRANCE BEING IN THE IN THE MILITARY ARRANGEMENTS OF NATO 
IT WAS A CYNICAL IF YOU LIKE PLOY BUT TOTALLY SUCCESSFUL HE WAS COMPLETELY RIGHT IN HIS ANALYSIS 
IN DECEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY TWO PRESIDENT KENNEDY MET PRIME MINISTER MACMILLAN IN THE BAHAMAS 
BRITAIN WAS BUYING AMERICA'S NEWEST WEAPONS SYSTEM 
I FEEL SURE THAT THE AGREEMENT 
INTO WHICH WE HAVE ENTERED IS A GOOD ONE FOR BOTH OF US 
FOR IN OBTAINING AN AGREEMENT FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM TO ACQUIRE WHAT IS CALLED THE POLARIS MISSILE 
THE ACQUISITION OF POLARIS WAS SOON OVERSHADOWED 
DE GAULLE FELT BRITAIN WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE U. S. AND BLOCKED BRITAIN'S ENTRY INTO THE COMMON MARKET 
SO DE GAULLE VETOED IT 
THAT OF COURSE POSTPONED THE WHOLE PROCESS BY TEN YEARS 
WHICH DIDN'T SUIT ANYBODY VERY WELL 
BUT THAT WAS THE STAGE WE WERE AT 
WE WERE ON THE MOVE BUT HADN'T YET ARRIVED AS A FULL MEMBER OF WHAT'S NOW THE EUROPEAN UNION 
I THINK DE GAULLE'S MOTIVES 
IN DEALING WITH THE QUESTION OF BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP 
IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY WERE VERY FRENCH NATIONAL MOTIVES 
I THINK HE FELT THAT BRITAIN COULD BECOME A LEADER IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY TO RIVAL FRANCE 
AND SO HE FOUND THE ARGUMENTS HE COULD FIND IN ORDER TO SAY NO TO US 
THE AMERICAN RELATIONSHIP WAS INDEED THE ONE HE CITED MOST 
SO WHAT HE SAID WAS TRUE ON THE AMERICAN POINT BUT I THINK HIS REAL REASONS WERE NOT THAT AT ALL 
AND SO TO THE YOUNGEST CONTINENT TO NORTH AMERICA 
IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST CONTINENTS 
AND YET ONE THAT'S LEAST SURE OF ITS DESTINY 
PATRICK O'DONOVAN REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON 
YANKEE DOODLE 
THE AMERICAN EAGLE 
THE SYMBOL OF A REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY WHOSE FIRST SUCCESS AGAINST THE BRITISH 
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO CHANGED THE COURSE OF HISTORY 
AND TODAY DOMINATES A VERY LARGE PART OF THE WORLD 
YET UNDER ITS WINGS ALL IS NOT WELL 
HERE IN AMERICA PEOPLE ARE WELL AWARE THAT THE NEXT TEN YEARS CONTAIN AN UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGE 
TO THEIR POWER TO THEIR COMFORT AND PERHAPS EVEN TO THEIR LIVES 
AND NO OTHER NATION HAS EVER BEEN WARNED SO PRECISELY AND SO OFTEN 
YET LIFE IS VERY GOOD HERE AND MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO FEEL 
THAT THE NEXT TEN YEARS WILL BE SIMPLY A CONTINUATION OF TODAY 
BUT SOME AMERICANS ESPECIALLY THE ARTICULATE ONES DO NOT TAKE THE PROSPECT QUITE SO CALMLY 
ONE OF THESE IS ADLAI STEVENSON 
HE'S CONCERNED WITH THE LACK OF INITIATIVE ABROAD AND THE CONFORMITY AT HOME 
HE REJECTS MANY OF THE THINGS THAT AMERICA TAKES FOR GRANTED 
MR. STEVENSON WAS TWICE DEFEATED FOR THE PRESIDENCY AND IS STILL STANDING 
IN THE WINGS AS A DEMOCRATIC POSSIBLE FOR A THIRD TRY 
PANORAMA FOUND HIM IN NEW YORK ON THE EIGHTEENTH FLOOR 
OF HIS FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL 
I'M VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE INDIVIDUAL IN MASS SOCIETY 
THE GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY HAS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR PHYSICAL EASE 
TO OUR MOBILITY AND SO ON BUT I WONDER IF IT'S CONTRIBUTED TO THE DISCRIMINATION OF OUR MINDS 
CERTAINLY WE HAVE BEEN OBSESSED IN THIS COUNTRY WITH 
WITH SECURITY PHYSICAL SECURITY ECONOMIC SECURITY SOCIAL SECURITY AND SO ON 
THE PRICE OF SECURITY IS OFTEN GROUP THINKING 
CONFORMITY AND ALL THE DANGERS TO INDIVIDUALITY 
TO THE DIVERSITY TO THE ECCENTRICITY 
OF INDIVIDUALS WHICH MAKE A COUNTRY EXCITING INTERESTING AND LIVELY AND DYNAMIC 
ADLAI STEVENSON'S REFERRING OBLIQUELY TO THE MCCARTHY ERA 
WHICH WAS JUST BEGINNING TO WANE AT THIS TIME 
BUT IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE FIFTIES 
PEOPLE WERE STILL DRAWING THEIR CURTAINS IF THEY WERE COMMUNISTS 
FEARFUL OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SPYING ON THEM 
THIS PROPAGANDA FILM 
SHOWS THE DEPTH OF PARANOIA 
FELT BY SOME SECTIONS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY 
FEARFUL OF A COMMUNIST TAKEOVER 
THE MCCARTHY ETHOS WAS HOSTILE TO THE EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN AND HOSTILE TO HOMOSEXUALITY 
SO THIS WIDER CONFORMITY SPREAD PERVASIVELY THROUGH AMERICAN SOCIETY 
NOW I THINK GIVEN FREEDOM GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE'LL DISCOVER THAT WE'RE HUNGRY FOR IT 
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS FREEDOM 
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT PERHAPS THAN THE INDIVIDUAL'S 
NATIONAL FREEDOM AND THE SURVIVAL OF THE IDEAS THAT ARE PRECIOUS TO US 
I THINK THAT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
IN THE PHRASE HUNGER FOR FREEDOM 
WE SAW THAT IN THE SIXTIES WITH THE GROWTH OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT 
AND THE TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN FREEDOM THAT WAS FINALLY ALLOWED TO AFRICAN AMERICANS 
I ALSO THINK WE SAW IT IN THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT 
I THINK THAT THE REBELLION CAME FROM PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF WHO WERE CRITICAL OF THE MCCARTHY ETHOS 
AND THEN IT SPREAD OUTWARDS 
BLOWING IN THE WIND BY BOB DYLAN 
BY THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS GAINING MOMENTUM 
DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING A BAPTIST MINISTER 
WAS LEADING THE CAMPAIGN WITH MARCHES AND NON VIOLENT PROTEST 
BY AROUND ABOUT SIXTY FOUR SIXTY FIVE 
PEOPLE WERE BEGINNING TO SAY THERE IS ANOTHER AMERICA 
THAT ACTUALLY THERE ARE A LOT OF POOR PEOPLE IN AMERICA 
AND THAT CAME PARTLY OUT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT 
BECAUSE A LOT OF UM BLACK PEOPLE WHO GOT INVOLVED WERE POINTING OUT THAT IT WASN'T ONLY VOTING RIGHTS 
BUT THEIR ECONOMIC POSITION UM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE 
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS BECOMING INCREASINGLY RADICALISED 
KING FOUND THAT MANY YOUNGER PEOPLE WERE BECOMING IMPATIENT WITH HIS STRATEGY 
OF NON VIOLENT ACTION AND BY NINETEEN SIXTY THREE HE TOO FELT THAT PROGRESS WAS STAGNATING 
WE CAN'T WIN THE STRUGGLE HERE IN AMERICA WITHOUT IN SOME WAY 
BRINGING WHITE AMERICA AROUND TO THE POINT OF BEING JUST 
AND SEEING THE NEGRO AS A HUMAN BEING AND TREATING HIM THAT WAY 
THE RIOT IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE UNHEARD 
AND AMERICA HAS FAILED TO HEAR THAT THE PLIGHT OF THE NEGRO POOR HAS WORSENED 
AMERICA HAS FAILED TO HEAR THAT LARGE SEGMENTS OF WHITE SOCIETY 
ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT TRANQUILLITY AND THE STATUS QUO 
THAN ABOUT HUMANITY JUSTICE AND EQUALITY 
IT TOOK A WHILE BUT IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF SEGREGATION THE SIT INS AT THE LUNCH COUNTERS 
I THINK PEOPLE WERE JUST ASTOUNDED PEOPLE WHO REALLY WEREN'T AWARE OF HOW DIFFICULT A SITUATION 
IT WAS IN THE SOUTH I THINK THAT WAS BROUGHT HOME TO ALL AMERICANS 
BY NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT IT WAS BROUGHT HOME TO THE WORLD 
PRO CIVIL RIGHTS AND ANTI VIETNAM WAR DEMONSTRATIONS WERE HELD NATIONWIDE 
BUT BOTH MARTIN LUTHER KING AND ROBERT KENNEDY WERE ASSASSINATED 
SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL BY THE ROLLING STONES 
ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO THE MAN WHO WAS HEAD OF THE MANHATTAN PROJECT 
THE ANGLO AMERICAN PROGRAMME WHICH DURING THE WAR PRODUCED THE ATOM BOMB 
WAS PILLORIED BEFORE CONGRESS FOR HIS DOUBTS 
BUT DOCTOR ROBERT OPPENHEIMER NO LONGER MAKES BOMBS AND HE IS NOW THEIR OPPONENT 
HE'S FOUND HIS ACADEMIC HAVEN 
HE'S HEAD OF A MARVELLOUS AND RICHLY ENDOWED INSTITUTION 
CALLED THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCE STUDIES IN PRINCETON NEW JERSEY 
HE'S LEFT ALONE AT HIS INSTITUTE TO WORK AND THINK AND WRITE 
AND TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE DO THE SAME AND NO MORE IS ASKED OF HIM 
I HOPE THAT THESE TEN YEARS WILL SEE A GROWING EFFORT 
TO TRANSFORM THE WORLD AND THE RELATIONS BETWEEN STATES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS 
TO EXORCISE THE UNPRECEDENTED DANGERS OF MODERN WARFARE 
FEELING OF DANGER WAS PERVASIVE 
UM NOT SIMPLY AS A QUESTION OF TALKING ABOUT INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 
BUT UM AS A A LIVING FEAR 
UM YOUNG PEOPLE WHO GOT INVOLVED IN C. N. D. TALKED ABOUT HAVING DREAMS ABOUT THE BOMB 
THE QUESTION AND ISSUE IS 
SHALL THE HUMAN RACE SURVIVE OR SHALL IT NOT 
GROWING UP IN THE FIFTIES WE ACTUALLY HAD DRILLS IN THE SCHOOLS 
YOU'D GET UNDERNEATH YOUR DESK GET AWAY FROM THE WINDOW 
FIRST YOU DUCK 
AND THEN YOU COVER 
AND VERY TIGHTLY YOU COVER THE BACK OF YOUR NECK AND YOUR FACE DUCK AND COVER 
UNDERNEATH A TABLE OR DESK OR ANYTHING ELSE CLOSE BY 
DUCK AND COVER 
AND OF COURSE WE ALL REMEMBER 
PRESIDENT KENNEDY WHEN HE CAME IN TO OFFICE ABOUT BUILDING A BUNKER IN YOUR BACK YARD 
I WENT ON THE ALDERMASTON MARCH 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO 
WE WERE BROUGHT UP WITH THIS FEAR OF ANNIHILATION 
IT WAS VERY GENUINE PEOPLE THOUGHT 
WE WERE GOING TO YOU KNOW BE ANNIHILATED 
AND SO THERE WAS A FEELING THAT WE WERE YOU KNOW AT THE EDGE OF DISASTER 
THERE WAS A POP SONG CALLED EVE OF DESTRUCTION 
BAN THE BOMB 
EVE OF DESTRUCTION 
ONE CONFLICT WAS TO SCAR THE DECADE 
VIETNAM 
AT THE START OF THE SIXTIES PRESIDENT KENNEDY INCREASED U. S. TROOPS 
FROM EIGHT HUNDRED TO OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND 
BY THE END OF THE DECADE U. S. FORCES NUMBERED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WITH NEARLY FIFTY THOUSAND DEAD 
RIDERS OF THE STORM BY THE DOORS 
OVER THREE MILLION VIETNAMESE WERE KILLED 
THE WAR WOULD CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS 
OF COURSE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES ARE GOING TO BE A DECADE OF SCIENCE 
BUT THE QUESTION WHICH INTERESTS ME IS WHAT KIND OF SCIENCE 
YOU SEE THE FALLACY OF THE FIFTIES HAS BEEN TO THINK 
THAT THE ONLY KIND OF SCIENCE WHICH MATTERS AND WHICH IS FORGING AHEAD IS PHYSICAL SCIENCE 
ATOMIC PHYSICS FUSION LAUNCHING PROJECTILES INTO SPACE CONTROL MECHANISMS ELECTRONICS 
NOW I THINK THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPORTANT WAY 
IN WHICH THE REAL BASIS OF SCIENCE IS SHIFTING 
I BELIEVE THAT THE GREAT WORK OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WILL BE NOT IN PHYSICS AT ALL BUT IN BIOLOGY 
I THINK IT'S IN EXPLORING THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF LIFE AND OF LIVING PROCESSES 
THAT THE GREAT PROGRESS OF THE NEXT TEN YEARS WILL COME 
WE ARE ON THE THRESHOLD OF A BIOLOGICAL REVOLUTION 
AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH THE BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION HAS ALREADY BEGUN 
IN SOME SENSES BRONOWSKI WAS RIGHT THERE WAS A BIOLOGICAL REVOLUTION 
AND THE IRONY IS IF YOU ASK BIOLOGY STUDENTS TODAY WHAT THEY'RE STUDYING 
THEY'RE NOT CUTTING UP DOGFISH THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT BIRDS 
THEY'RE BASICALLY DOING CHEMISTRY BIOCHEMISTRY LOOKING AT CELLS 
THE ENTIRE SCIENCE HAD COMPLETELY CHANGED 
SO IN THAT SENSE HE WAS RIGHT IT'S VERY HARD TO DENY THAT 
I THINK LIKE MOST SCIENCES BIOLOGY CHANGED FOR TECHNICAL REASONS 
THAT THE TECHNOLOGY OF LOOKING AT THINGS GOT MUCH MUCH BETTER 
THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF WORK I THINK THAT HISTORY WILL SAY WAS DONE IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
WAS THE WORK BY CRICK AND WATSON ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE BASIC MATERIAL OF LIFE 
WE NOW UNDERSTAND HOW LIFE IS HANDED ON FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION 
IN WHAT WAY IT UNFOLDS ITSELF AND CONSTANTLY RENEWS ITSELF 
AND THAT'S WHERE WE SHALL GO IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
THERE HAD BEEN ONE ENORMOUS BREAKTHROUGH WHICH WAS WATSON AND CRICK THE DOUBLE HELIX OF D. N. A. 
BUT THAT REALLY HAD NOT PENETRATED MUCH INTO THE PUBLIC IMAGINATION 
ITS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT BUT WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED ONLY ONE REPORTER ACTUALLY COVERED THE STORY 
IT WASN'T SEEN AS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT 
BUT OF COURSE THAT NOW HAS CHANGED COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY 
AND I THINK BRONOWSKI WAS PRESCIENT IN THAT MOMENT OF NOTICING THE SEA CHANGE IN THE WHOLE OF SCIENCE 
WE SHALL LEARN MUCH MORE ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE CELL WORKS 
PERHAPS WE SHALL LEARN WHAT REALLY MAKES A CELL GO WRONG 
AND THEN WE SHALL AT LAST HAVE THE BASIC SECRET OF CANCER 
WE SHALL CERTAINLY LEARN A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT THE ACTION OF DRUGS ON CELLS 
PARTICULARLY THE CELLS OF THE NERVES AND OF THE BRAIN 
I THINK BRONOWSKI'S STATEMENT ABOUT CANCER IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE OPTIMISM OF THE SIXTIES 
AND THE MITIGATED PESSIMISM OF THE MODERN DAY 
CERTAINLY HE WAS DEAD RIGHT IN SAYING THAT WE NOW UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF CANCER 
MAYBE SOON AND I'M SURE BRONOWSKI WOULD SPEAK WITH EQUAL ENTHUSIASM TODAY 
IN THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM 
MAYBE SOON THIS ENORMOUS MASS OF THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE WITH THE CELL 
WILL TURN ITSELF INTO A PRACTICAL RESULT OF CURING CANCER 
I'M SURE BRONOWSKI WOULD HAVE PREDICTED FORTY YEARS AGO THAT IT WOULD HAVE DONE IT BY NOW BUT IT HASN'T 
BUT IT MIGHT TOMORROW THE DAY AFTER NOBODY KNOWS 
TEN NINE IGNITION SEQUENCE STARTS 
THE FINAL PART OF THE PANORAMA PROGRAMME LOOKED AT THE CHALLENGES OF SPACE EXPLORATION 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DECADE THE RUSSIANS WERE DOMINATING THE SPACE RACE 
HERE IS HOW THE PROGRAMME AND THEIR EXPERT SAW THE SITUATION IN JANUARY NINETEEN SIXTY 
FOR MOST OF US THE SYMBOL OF PROGRESS IN THE SIXTIES MUST REMAIN THE RACE TO THE MOON AND WHO WILL WIN 
PERHAPS BY NINETEEN SEVENTY THE FIRST SPACESHIP WILL HAVE LANDED ON THE MOON 
WE SHALL KNOW WHETHER THESE MEN ARE RUSSIAN OR AMERICAN 
THEY CAN HARDLY BE BRITISH 
BUT EVEN IF THERE'S NO BRITISH MOON ROCKET BY NINETEEN SEVENTY 
WE SHALL HAVE A GRANDSTAND VIEW THROUGH THE AERIALS OF OUR HUGE RADIO TELESCOPE AT JODRELL BANK 
HERE'S THE DIRECTOR PROFESSOR LOVELL 
LAST YEAR THE TELESCOPE AT JODRELL BANK WAS INVOLVED IN SOME EXCITING RESEARCH PROGRAMMES 
THESE COVERED THE EXPLORATION OF THE REMOTE PARTS OF THE UNIVERSE 
AND THE TRACKING OF THE AMERICAN AND RUSSIAN SPACE PROBES 
PERSONALLY I THINK THAT RUSSIA NOW HAS THE CAPABILITY BOTH OF SENDING A MAN INTO SPACE 
AT LEAST FOR A FEW ORBITS AND ALSO OF MAKING A SOFT LANDING OF INSTRUMENTS ON THE MOON 
I THINK THAT WITHIN A FEW YEARS ALSO WE SHALL SEE INSTRUMENTED PROBES 
GETTING CLOSE TO THE NEARER PLANETS SUCH AS MARS AND VENUS 
WHEN THE SPACE PROGRAMME STARTED THE RUSSIANS HAD THE LEAD 
THEY WERE MORE SINGLE MINDED ABOUT IT 
THEY HAD THE FIRST SATELLITE FIRST MAN IN SPACE FIRST SPACE PROBE TO THE PLANETS 
THEY HAD ALL THAT AND IT WORKED AMERICA HAD TO CATCH UP 
THE AMERICANS WERE STILL SUFFERING FROM THE DIRECTIVES OF EISENHOWER 
THAT UM NO USE SHOULD BE MADE OF MILITARY TECHNOLOGY 
WHEREAS THE RUSSIANS USED THEIR BALLISTIC MISSILE TO LAUNCH THE SPUTNIK AND THESE OTHER SATELLITES 
THE AMERICANS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY SURPRISED BY THE CAPABILITY OF THE SOVIETS 
UM YOU KNOW ONE 
ONE MEMBER OF CONGRESS SAID ANYONE COULD THROW A HUNK OF OLD IRON INTO SPACE THAT WAS THE SORT OF ATTITUDE 
THEY REFUSED TO BELIEVE FOR A LONG TIME THAT THE SOVIETS HAD THIS CAPABILITY 
ALAS THIS WAS NOT THE CASE 
AND JUST ONE YEAR LATER IT WAS RUSSIAN COSMONAUT YURI GAGARIN 
WHO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE FIRST MANNED ORBIT AROUND THE GLOBE 
IT WAS HEADLINE NEWS AROUND THE WORLD 
THESE SOVIET SUCCESSES MADE AMERICANS REALISE THEY WERE IN SECOND PLACE IN THE SPACE RACE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT AMERICA NOT BEING ABLE TO DO THE SAME 
WELL IF I WAS IN MILITARY SERVICE AND FELL DOWN ON THE JOB LIKE THAT I COULD STAND FOR COURT MARTIAL 
SOMEBODY'S FALLING DOWN ON THE JOB BADLY 
JUST ONE MONTH LATER AMERICA FOLLOWED IT WAS TO BE THE FIRST OF MANY MISSIONS 
THEN OF COURSE THE GREAT QUESTION WHICH ARISES IS WHETHER WITHIN THIS DECADE 
WE SHALL SEE THE ACTUAL LANDING OF A MAN ON THE MOON 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO JUDGE WHETHER THIS WILL IN FACT TAKE PLACE 
BUT IT'S USEFUL TO REMEMBER THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUSSIAN ACADEMY NESMEYANOV 
HAS STATED THAT THE PROJECT OF LANDING A MAN ON THE MOON 
IS IN THE NEXT SEVEN YEAR PLAN FOR SOVIET SCIENCE 
ALL THAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS THAT A SHORT TIME AGO I WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR A LITERARY GAZETTE IN MOSCOW 
AND MADE REFERENCE TO NESMEYANOV'S STATEMENT 
WELL THE ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED AS I WROTE IT 
APART FROM THE FACT THAT THE TIMESCALE OF THE MAN ON THE MOON PROJECT WAS CROSSED OUT 
SO I THINK AT THE PRESENT TIME IT MUST BE REGARDED AS SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL 
WHETHER THE MAN WILL BE LANDED ON THE MOON WITHIN THIS DECADE 
WELL EVEN BERNARD LOVELL CAN'T BE RIGHT EVERY TIME 
AND WE'VE EVERY REASON TO THINK THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE SO 
WE WERE STILL UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHO WOULD GET THE MAN ON THE MOON AT THAT TIME 
IT SOON OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE RUSSIANS SEEMED MORE ANXIOUS THAN THE AMERICANS 
TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD GET THEIR MAN BACK TO EARTH SAFELY 
IN RESPONSE TO THE RUSSIAN SUCCESS IN SPACE PRESIDENT KENNEDY ADDRESSED AMERICA 
I BELIEVE THAT THIS NATION SHOULD COMMIT ITSELF TO ACHIEVING THE GOAL 
BEFORE THIS DECADE IS OUT 
OF LANDING A MAN ON THE MOON AND RETURNING HIM SAFELY TO THE EARTH 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY THERE WAS ONLY ONE TELESCOPE IN THE WORLD THAT COULD TRACK SPACE ROCKETS AND MISSILES 
JODRELL BANK IN CHESHIRE 
SIR BERNARD LOVELL SOON FOUND HE WAS BEING ASKED TO USE IT FOR MORE THAN JUST ASTRONOMY 
WE HADN'T BUILT THE TELESCOPE TO HELP THE RUSSIANS AND THE AMERICANS 
WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT SANDWICH 
SOUNDS INTERESTING IN RETROSPECT BUT I CAN TELL YOU IT WAS PRETTY ANXIOUS TIMES THEN 
THIS LASTED UNTIL THE COLD WAR WAS OVER 
I MEAN THIS LED US TO A TRULY REMARKABLE SITUATION 
WHERE AS THE CUBAN CRISIS DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE SOVIETS AND THE WEST 
WE STILL HAD THE ONLY INSTRUMENT IN THE WORLD THAT COULD DETECT THE LAUNCHING OF THE SOVIET MISSILES 
I HAD AGREED IN THE EVENT OF A MILITARY EMERGENCY WE WOULD USE THE TELESCOPE TO DETECT THE LAUNCH OF 
SOVIET BALLISTIC MISSILES WHICH WERE TARGETED ON LONDON 
AT THE START OF THE DECADE RUSSIA MAY HAVE LED THE SPACE RACE 
BUT ON JULY TWENTY FIRST NINETEEN SIXTY NINE THE WORLD WAS ASKING 
WOULD THE AMERICANS FINISH IT BY GETTING THE FIRST MAN ON THE MOON BY THE END OF THE DECADE 
CONTACT THE EAGLE HAS LANDED 
IT'S ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN 
ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND 
DURING THE ACTUAL APOLLO LANDINGS I WAS WEARING TWO HATS 
I WAS OVER AT NASA CAME BACK TO DO THE COMMENTARIES 
I ALWAYS REMEMBER AT THE TIME WHEN I SAW NEIL AND BUZZ GOING DOWN ONTO THE MOON SURFACE 
FRANKLY I WAS WORRIED REMEMBER THIS HADN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE HAD THEY MADE A FAULTY LANDING 
COME DOWN AT AN ANGLE SOMETHING GONE WRONG THEY COULDN'T HAVE GONE BACK 
COLUMBIA COLUMBIA THIS IS HOUSTON OVER 
THE AMERICANS DID TAKE A CONSIDERABLE RISK 
NEARLY EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WAS DUPLICATED IN THE AMERICAN MOON PROGRAMS EXCEPT ONE 
AND THAT WAS THE ROCKET WHICH WOULD LIFT OFF ARMSTRONG AND ALDRIN 
TO THE MOTHER SHIPS CIRCLING AROUND THE MOON 
IF THAT HAD FAILED I'M AFRAID THAT ARMSTRONG AND ALDRIN WOULD NOT HAVE SURVIVED 
PREPARE FOR TAKE OFF 
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL 
TWENTY SIX THIRTY SIX FEET A SECOND UP VERY SMOOTH 
WHAT I THINK IS NOT KNOWN AT THAT TIME 
WHEN ARMSTRONG AND ALDRIN WERE ON THE MOON THE RUSSIANS HAD A SATELLITE IN ORBIT AROUND THE MOON 
NOW UNFORTUNATELY FROM THE POINT OF THE VIEW OF THE RUSSIANS 
SOMETHING WENT WRONG AT THE MOMENT OF LANDING 
IF THEY HAD SUCCEEDED THEY WOULD HAVE GOT MOON ROCKS BACK TO EARTH BEFORE THE AMERICANS 
YOU CAN SAY THAT THE DECADE WAS SPANNED BY TWO EVENTS IN SPACE 
THE FIRST ONE IS GAGARIN THE FIRST MAN IN SPACE ACHIEVED BY THE SOVIET UNION TO WORLD ACCLAIM 
AND THE SECOND IS THE MOON LANDING ACHIEVED BY THE UNITED STATES AT THE END OF THE DECADE TO WORLD ACCLAIM 
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WHEN GAGARIN AND THE SPUTNIK STORY CAME OUT OF THE SOVIET UNION 
THE UNITED STATES SAW A POSSIBLE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE AHEAD OF THEM BY THE SOVIET UNION 
AND GOT ITS ACT TOGETHER IN A VERY BIG WAY 
AND THEY GOT TO THE MOON AND THE SOVIET UNION NEVER GOT TO THE MOON 
THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WERE A BIT OF A TURNING POINT IN THAT REGARD 
THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WERE MARKED BY CONFLICT PROTEST 
COLD WAR STANDOFFS AND ASSASSINATIONS 
BUT THERE WERE ALSO MAJOR SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES AND AN EXPLOSION OF POLITICAL ACTIVISM 
WOMEN FOUND LIBERATION AND AFRICAN AMERICANS SECURED NEW RIGHTS 
BUT IT WAS THE SPACE RACE WHICH DEFINED THE DECADE
