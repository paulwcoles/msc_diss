MONEY MARKETS AND SO MUCH MORE 
IT IS FRIDAY IT IS WORKING LUNCH 
A BIG RISE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGES 
AS THE CREDIT CRUNCH BITES BUT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS BRINGING IN MORE HELP 
FOR THOSE THREATEN WITH LOSING 
THEIR HOME WE WILL FIND OUT WHAT 
IS ON OFFER ALSO TODAY THE 
PENSION FUND TOOK ON TOO MANY 
CUSTOMERS AND TOOK THEM ON IT IS 
TAKING ON HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
MORE 
IT IS JUST SELLING PEOPLE'S MORE LIVELIHOODS OFF WITH LITTLE CONCERN 
FOR THE INDIVIDUAL 
AND IF YOU ARE 
ONE OF THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE WAITING FOR AN ALLOTMENT I 
HAVE NEWS OF HOW A ONE HUNDRED YEAR OLD LAW 
MEANS YOU COULD FORCE YOUR LOCAL 
COUNCIL TO PROVIDE SOME MORE OF MY 
GUESTS IN A MOMENT THE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE FACING THE THREAT OF 
REPOSSESSION HAS RISEN COMPARED TO 
THIS TIME LAST YEAR THIS IS OF 
COURSE ALL TO DO WITH FAILING TO 
KEEP UP MORTGAGE PAYMENTS THERE IS 
A LITTLE BIT OF NUMBER CRUNCHING WE 
WANT TO DO THERE IS ALSO THE 
PROMISE OF HELP LET'S LOOK THE 
NUMBER OF CLAIMS THIS IS WHERE THE 
MORTGAGE COMPANIES AND BANKS ISSUE 
A CLAIM TO REPOSSESS A HOUSE 
THROUGH THE COUNTY COURT THIS IS 
UP SIXTEEN PER CENT COMPARED TO THIS TIME LAST 
YEAR THAT IS CLAIMS T. NUMBER WHICH 
RESULTED IN ORDERS WHICH HAS 
ALLOWED THE PERSON WHO HAS APPLIED 
FOR A WARRANT TO HAVE SOMEONE 
EVICTED THAT WAS UP SEVENTEEN PER CENT NOW WHAT 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS BY LOOKING 
BACK OVER SOME FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO HOW 
THESE FIGURES DIFFER LAST YEAR THERE WERE SOME TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
HOMES REPOSSESSED ACROSS THE U. K. AS 
YOU CAN SEE IT IS LESS THAN THE 
NUMBER OF ORDERS MADE THE WHOLE OF 
LAST YEAR WAS AROUND NINETY FIVE THOUSAND NOW 
THE REASON FOR THIS DIFFERENCE YOU 
SEE BETWEEN THE CLAIM ISSUED THE 
ORDERS MADE AND THE ACTUAL NUMBER 
OF REPOSSESSIONS WHICH IS THE 
BOTTOM LINE IS OFTEN A SOLUTION CAN 
BE FOUND BETWEEN THE TIME AND 
ORDERS ISSUED AND A REPOSSESSION 
TAKING PLACE WE WILL HEAR FROM 
PATRICK BOYDEN FROM PRICE 
WATERHOUSE COOPERS ABOUT WHY THE 
NUMBERS ARE RISING 
PEOPLE HAVE OVER STRETCHED 
THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF CREDIT NOW 
THEY FIND THE PINCH BECAUSE OF THE 
INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES FOOD IT 
PUTS A SQUEEZE ON THE MONTHLY 
BUDGET THEY ARE UNABLE TO PAY 
THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS LENDERS 
ARE PROBABLY STEPPING UP THE ACTION 
THEY CAN SEE A FALLING HOUSE MARKET 
THAT PUTS AT RISK THEIR SECURITY 
THEY MAY BE MORE WILLING TO TAKE 
POSSESSION ACTION ALTHOUGH NOT 
NECESSARILY TO TAKE POSSESSION OF 
THE PROPERTIES L. THINK IN SOME 
INSTANCES IT IS TO FORCE PEOPLE TO 
ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUES THEY 
HAVE GOT HOPEFULLY THEY WILL COME 
ONE A REPAYMENT PLAN WHICH WILL 
SATISFY BOTH SIDES IN FURTHER NEWS 
OUT TODAY TO HELP PEOPLE WHO FIND 
THEMSELVES IN THIS SITUATION 
PERHAPS SORT OUT PAYMENT PLANS THE 
HOUSING MINISTER CAROLINE FLINT 
GAVE DETAILS OF A SCHEME WHICH 
COULD HELP HOME OWNERS MORE FREE 
LEGAL ADVICE FOR THOSE AT RISK OF 
POSSESSION AND FREE REPTDATION IF 
THE CASE GOES TO THE COUNTY COURT 
YOU MAY REMEMBER MORE DO THAN ARE 
REPOSSESSED THERE'LL BE MORE 
SPECIALIST TRAINING FOR DEBT ADVICE 
AGENCIES ONE OF THE AGENCYS WHO 
WILL HAVE THAT TRAINING IS CITIZENS 
ADVICE WELCOME SUE EDWARDS WHO IS 
FROM THERE HELLO SUE WHAT DO YOU 
MAKE OF THIS PACKAGE OF EXTRA HELP 
TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU TO PASS ON TO 
PEOPLE IN TROUBLE 
IT IS VERY 
WELCOME WE ARE GETTING EXTRA MONEY 
A LOT OF THE CITIZENS ADVICE 
BUREAUS ARE IN COUNTY COURTS GIVING 
ADVICE TO PEOPLE FACING MORTGAGE 
REPOSSESSION HEARINGS FROM 
RESEARCH SOMEONE CAN COME IN AND 
FEEL THE BAILIFF WILL GO STRAIGHT 
AROUND AND KICK THEM OUT OF THEIR 
HOUSE WHEN THEY TALK TO ONE OF OUR 
ADVISERS AND WE CAN PUT A 
REASONABLE REPAYMENT PLAN IN FRONT 
OF THE COURT THEY STAY IN THEIR 
HOME THAT IS SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T 
KNOW BEFORE 
SHELTER GIVE THIS 
ADVICE IF YOU CAN TAKE US BACK TO 
THE GRAPH I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO 
ALL THE FIGURES BUT THE BLUE LINE 
IS ALL THE NUMBER OF ORDERS MADE 
THEN A YELLOW LINE WHICH SHOWS THE 
NUMBER OF REPOSSESSIONS PERHAPS 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF ALL THESE CLAIMS PERHAPS 
VERSES TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND REPOSSESSIONS A ONE 
IN SIX CHANCE OF SAVING THE DAY 
YES THERE CAN BE BUT WE CAN HELP 
YOU DO OTHER THINGS LIKE FOR 
EXAMPLE IF YOU CANNOT PAY YOUR 
MORTGAGE AND PAY OFF ARREARS THEN 
WE CAN ADVISE YOU ABOUT OTHER 
OPTIONS INCLUDING SELLING YOUR 
HOME YOURSELF YOU WILL GET A 
BETTER DEAL THAN LETTING IT BE 
REPOSSESSED AND SOLD BY THE LENDER 
AT A LOSS 
WHEN PEOPLE ARE FACED 
WITH THE COUNTY COURT DO THEY KNOW 
THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE IT WILL 
NOT GO THE WRONG WAY 
NO MOST 
PEOPLE COME IN THEY ARE VERY 
SCARED THEY THINK IT WILL BE LIKE 
A CROWN COURT WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE 
THERE THE JUDGE IN THE WIG AND IT 
WILL ALL BE VERY SHAMEFUL AND THEY 
ARE GOING TO LOSE THEIR HOME IT IS 
ONLY WHEN THEY SIT DOWN AND TALK TO 
ONE OF OUR ADVISERS THEY FIND THERE 
IS SOMETHING THEY COULD DO AND WE 
COULD POSSIBLY SPEAK TO THE JUDGE 
IT IS NOT LIKE A CROWN COURT IT IS 
IN A PRIVATE ROOM WITH A JUDGE THE 
SOLICITOR AND THE MORTGAGE ADVISER 
THERE 
DO YOU THINK THAT LENDERS THERE ARE NIPPING TO THE CALL PREVIOUSLY 
THAN IN OTHER YEARS ARE THEY 
TRYING TO GET THIS ORDER MADE 
EARLY ONE WOULD THINK THEY 
PROBABLY ARE GOING AFTER VULNERABLE 
PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS 
WRONG YOU TELL ME 
WE SEE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WITH MORTGAGES WITH SUB 
PRIME LENDERS THEY ARE GOING TO 
COURT QUICKLY ONE OR TWO MONTHS IN 
ARREARS THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO 
LISTEN TO PEOPLE'S OFFERS OF 
REPAYMENT SO THEY ARE TAKING THEM 
STRAIGHT TO COURT THAT JUST RACKED 
UP THE COSTS FOR BORROWERS 
THERE'LL BE THE LENDER'S COSTS FOR 
TAKING YOU TO COURT AS WELL SO SO FINALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 
REALLY IS THE BEST ADVICE IS DON'T 
IGNORE THE LETTER ISN'T IT DON'T DON'T IGNORE THE PROBLEM IT WILL NOT GO 
AWAY IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE COME 
AND SEEK ADVICE 
THERE IS A GOOD 
CHANCE OF SAVING THE DAY YES YES YOU WILL HAVE TO COME BACK WE ARE 
LOOKING AT MORE FIGURES ALL YEAR 
WINDSOR LIFE WHICH HAS BEEN 
BOMBARDED WITH COMPLAINTS FROM 
CUSTOMERS IS TO TAKE ON ANOTHER 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEM NOW WE HIGHLIGHTED 
THE PROBLEMS YOU HAD LAST MONTH 
WHEN WINDSOR IT SEEMED UNABLE TO 
COPE WITH AN ARMY OF NEW CUSTOMERS 
IT TOOK ON THIS YEAR BUT NOW 
SORRY THAT WAS THE CAMERA BEING 
KNOCKED YOU HAVE NOT FALLEN OFF 
YOUR CHAIR NOW YOU HAVE TOLTD US 
THE COMPANY HAS BROUGHT ZURICH 
LIVE'S PENSIONS AND THE EFFECT WILL 
TAKE EFFECT NEXT MONTHSY MAN HAS 
BEEN INVESTIGATING THIS FOR WHILE 
YOU HAVE READ ALL THE VIEWER'S E. 
MAILS AND LETTERS RECAP SO FAR 
THEY WERE GETTING EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CALLS A 
WEEK WHEN THEY ONLY EXPECTED THREE THOUSAND 
THEY HAVE HAD THOUSANDS OF 
COMPLAINTS THE BIG ISSUES WE HAVE 
SEEN ARE FIRST OF ALL PEOPLE WHO 
ARE STILL SAVING FOR THEIR PENSIONS 
HAVING TROUBLE TRANSFERRING MONEY 
ACROSS FROM ONE FUND TO ANOTHER 
AND HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THE 
PENSION SET UP AND THEN PAID ON 
TIME THE SECOND BIG PROBLEM WAS 
WITH PEOPLE ALREADY GETTING THEIR 
PENSIONS OR AN NEWTYS AS IT IS 
CALLED THE MONEY NOT TURNING UP 
THOSE ARE THE TWO BIG ISSUES LET'S 
LOOK AT THE RECENT HISTORY OF 
WINDSOR LIFE IT HAS GOT BIGGER 
FAST AT THE END OF LAST YEAR THEY 
TOOK ON FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW POLICYHOLDERS 
THAT INCLUDED THOSE OF A COMPANY 
CALLED TOMORROW WHICH INCLUDED THE 
EX G. E. LIFE POLICYHOLDERS AND 
CALLED TOMORROW WHICH INCLUDED THE EX G. E. LIFE POLICYHOLDERS AND 
N. M. 
LIFE THAT TOOK THEM TO THIRTEEN MILLION 
IN ALL YOU CAN SEE THE SCALE OF 
THIS COMPANY WHAT IS EXPECTED TO 
HAPPEN AT THE END OF NEXT MONTH IS 
THEY WILL TAKE ON A FURTHER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
ANUTANTS THEY ARE KAULD THEY ARE 
IN RECEIPT OF THEIR CALLED THEY 
ARE THE RECIPIENTS IT IS BECAUSE 
IT IS THE ANUITANTS THAT IS WHERE 
THE FOCUS OF INTEREST IS TO MAKE 
SURE THEY GET THEM ON TIME 
WHAT DO 
THE COMPANIES INVOLVED HERE SAY 
THEN 
WELL THE COMPANIES INVOLVED THEN ARE SAY IT IS GOING TO BE ALL 
RIGHT F. Y. COULD TAKE YOU FIRST 
THROUGH ONE OF THE VIEWERS WHO HAS 
GOT IN TOUCH WITH US IT IS BERNARD 
FROM YORK HE IS IN RECEIPT OF 
PENSION HE AND HIS WIFE FROM 
ZURICH LIFE AT THE MOMENT HE IS 
CONCERNED THAT HE MIGHT BE INCLUDED 
IN THE CLASS OF PEOPLE WHO THE 
MONEY WILL NOT TURN UP 
WE RELY ON 
THIS TO PAY COUNCIL TAX AND ALL OUR 
OTHER COSTS EACH MONTH WITHOUT 
THIS COMING IN I AM SURE THE LOCAL 
COUNCILS WILL NOT WAITING WILL 
NOT WAIT UNTIL WINDSOR LIFE DECIDE 
TO PAY US 
MALCOLM MCCLEAN HAS 
FOLLOWED THIS L. ASKED HIM IF IT IS 
REASONABLE FOR PEOPLE LIKE 
BERNARD 
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SITUATION 
I THINK THEY DO HAVE A RIGHT TO BE 
CONCERNED I THINK WE ALL WANT TO 
ASK QUESTIONS OF WINDSOR LIFE AS TO 
WHETHER THEY ARE CAPABLE OF TAKING 
ON THIS EXTRA WORK WE KNOW THE 
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE OCCURRED WITH 
THEM IN CONNECTION WITH AN EARLIER 
TAKEOVER OF THE COMPANY TOMORROW 
AND THOSE PROBLEMS ARE STILL 
CONTINUING WE ARE STILL GETTING 
CALLS ON OUR HELPLINE WHATEVER 
RECOVERY PLAN THEY HAVE PUT IN 
PLACE IT IS NOT COMPLETE YET THIS 
IS A SIZABLE CHUNK OF NEW BUSINESS 
THROUGH MALCOLM'S GOOD OFFICES 
LOT OF PROBLEMS OUR VIEWERS HAVING 
PROBLEMS WHAT ARE THE COMPANIES 
INVOLVED SAYING YOU HINTED BEFORE 
YOU SAID IT IS ALL RIGHT 
FIRST OF 
ALL ZURICH THIS IS WHAT THEY SAY 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE END OF NEXT 
MONTH SHOULD THE COMPANIES NOT 
BELIEVE IT IS THE CORRECT TIME TO 
MOVE THE ADMINISTRATION THAT IS 
NOT THE BUSINESS THE BUSINESS 
ACROSS THEN ZURICH WILL CONTINUE 
TO ADMINISTER THE AKNEWTYS BUT ON 
WINDSOR LIFE'S HALF UNTIL IT IS 
SEEN APPROPRIATE THEY WILL LOOK AT 
THAT DURING THE SEVERAL WEEKS FROM 
NOW WE HOPE THEY GET IT RIGHT 
WINDSOR LIFE HAS GIVEN US A 
STATEMENT ALONG THE SAME LINES IT 
WILL ENSURE IT HAS SUFFICIENT STAFF 
AVAILABLE TO DEAL WITH ENQUIRIES 
AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WHICH COMES OUT 
OF THIS THIS THERE IS SO MUCH OF 
THIS TAKING OVER OF OTHER PEOPLE'S 
PENSION SCHEMES WHICH IS HAPPENING 
AT THE MOMENT I TALKED TO THE 
FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY ABOUT 
IT IT HAS TO BE APPROVED BY COURT 
BUT THAT HAPPENED MONTHS AGO THE 
F. S. A. SAID IF THEY WERE UNHAPPY WITH 
ANY TRANSFER WE WOULD BRING THIS TO 
THE ATTENTION OF THE COURT BUT BY 
THEIR NATURE THESE PROBLEMS EMERGE 
LATER ON THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE 
AN APPROPRIATE MECHANISM FOR 
DEALING THIS IF PEOPLE LIKE 
BERNARD SAID STOP IT I DON'T WANT 
IT TO HAPPEN IT IS NOT FAIR WE 
ARE VICTIMS AND WE CANNOT CONTROL 
IT THERE IS NOTHING WHICH CAN BE 
DONE THE COURT SAID THIS TRANSFER 
HAS TO TAKE PLACE THERE IS AN 
ISSUE TO BE ADDRESSED HERE IT IT AFFECTS PEOPLE'S FUTURES HERE 
DEMAND FOR ALLOTMENTS IS SOARING 
THEY HAVE BEEN DISAPPEARING IN 
RECORD NUMBERS ADDRESS DEVELOPERS 
SNAP UP PLOTS FOR HOUSE BUILDING 
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PLOTS HAVE BEEN 
LOST IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WAITING 
LISTS IN SOME PLACES STRETCH BEYOND 
A DECADE THERE MIGHT BE AN ANSWER 
THE ALLOTMENTS ACT IT IS ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
OLD THIS YEAR IT DOES INCLUDE A 
WAY OF COMPELLING LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
TO PROVIDE MORE PLOTS AND ROB HAS 
BEEN LOOKING AROUND 
THERE IS A REVOLUTION GOING ON DOWN 
AT YOUR LOCAL ALLOTMENTS ONCE THE 
HOME OF MAYBE GRANDDADS THEY ARE 
MORE LIKELY TO BE THE PRESERVE OF 
THE YOUNG PROFESSIONAL CLATSZS 
ALLOTMENTS SO ROCK'N'ROLL 
THE ACE OF SPADES 
BUT ALL THAT DIGGING RAKING AND 
PLANTING CAN BE BACK BREAKING WORK 
WHAT IS THE APPEAL 
FOR VETERAN GUARDERS LIKE EDDIE AND 
HIS AWARD WINNING PLOT IT IS ABOUT 
MORE THAN JUST GROWING VEG 
IT IS A 
COMMUNITY IN ITSELF YOU KNOW WE 
HAVE GOT ALL THE BANTER WHICH GOES 
ON YOU HELP EACH OTHER IT IS SO 
GREAT TO SWAP THINGS TO GIVE 
THINGS TO EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME 
AND IT IS GREAT 
IT HAS CHANGED THE 
SHAPE AND THE WAY PEOPLE COME HERE 
HAVE CHANGED AS WELL OVER THE 
YEARS 
GARDENERS AT ONE TIME WERE YEARS THOUGHT OF LIKE MYSELF AN OLD MAN 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN NOW WE HAVE 
SO MANY YOUNG ONES A GREAT THING IS 
LADIES MOST OF THE ALLOTMENTS ON 
HERE NOW ARE LADIES AND THEY ARE 
KEEN THEY ARE GOING FOR THE 
ORGANIC GARDENING THEY BRING IN 
NEW IDEAS OF COURSE 
IN FACT THE NUMBER OF WOMEN 
ALLOTMENT GARDENERS HAS GROWN FROM 
TWO PER CENT THIRTY YEARS AGO TO TWENTY PER CENT NOW A FEW 
PLOTS AWAY DENISE IS TYPICAL OF THE 
NEW BREED OF ALLOTMENT KEEPERS I I LOVE MY ALLOTMENT L. COME DOWN HERE 
I DIG IT GETS RID OF MY STRESSES 
I GET EXERCISE FROM IT L. LIKE THE 
VEGETABLES TASTE FRESHER OF 
COURSE THEY ARE CHEAPER THAN THE 
SHOPS IT IS GREAT BECAUSE THEY 
DON'T HAVE ANY CHEMICALS ON IT IS 
REALLY GOOD 
YOU ARE PART OF A GROWING TREND 
MORE WOMEN GETTING INVOLED HOW 
MANY WOMEN ARE THERE ON THIS SITE 
QUITE A FEW ON THIS SITE L. TOOK 
OVER FROM A LADY WHO RAN THIS PLOT 
FOR TEN YEARSVY A NEIGHBOUR HERE 
WHO HAS RUN FOR A FEW YEARS LINDA 
OVER THERE HAS JUST TAKEN OVER IT 
IS A BUSY SITE WITH LOTS OF LADIES 
WE ARE IN STRONG COMPETITION WITH 
THE MEN HERE WE HAVE TWO MORE 
WOMEN DOWN THERE IT HAS TAKEN OFF 
WITH HIM HERE 
THERE IS SOMETHING VERY THERAPEUTIC 
ABOUT PLANTING A FEW PARSNIPS HERE 
IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE THERE IS 
WAITING LIST OF ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN 
GREATER MANCHESTER THERE EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE 
AND IN PLYMOUTH ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN 
SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY PEOPLE 
WERE TOLD THEY HAVE TO WAIT TWENTY FIVE 
YEARS THINGS ARE SO BAD THAT IN 
MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
ALLOTMENTS ARE BEING SPLIT IN HALF 
TO COPE WITH DEMAND THE ONE HUNDRED YEAR 
OLD RELUCTANT ALLOTMENTS ACT CAN 
FORCE COUNCILS TO PROVIDE THEM 
IF X. COUNCIL TAX PAYERS GET 
TOGETHER DECIDE THEY WANT 
ALLOTMENTS AND MAKE WRITTEN 
REPRESENTATIONS TO A COUNCIL THE 
COUNCIL ASKED TO FIND THEM SPACE 
IT HAPPENS A LOT MORE THAN IT USED 
TO ALLOTMENTS CAN BE SEEN BY 
CERTAIN MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES AS A 
BIT OF AN EMBARRASSMENT BIT OF AN AND AN ANACHRONISM 
IT IS HARD FOR COUNCILS TO REFUSE 
THEY CANNOT SAY THEY CAN FIND THE 
LAND THE ACT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT 
TO MAKE COMPULSORY ORDERS TO HIRE 
OR BUY A POTENTIAL SITE FRESH FROM 
FIGHTING OFF THREE ATTEMPTS BY 
SUPERMARKETS TO BUILD ALLOTMENTS 
THE IMPORTANCE IS NOW MOVING UP THE 
AGENDA AGENDA IT CAN BE ONE OF THE LAST PLACES IN 
THE COMMUNITY WERE SOCIALISING CAN 
TAKE PLACE WHERE YOU GO THE 
WISDOM OF THE OTHER THE FOG PAST ON 
TO YOUNG GARDENERS WHICH I THINK 
IS ABSOLUTELY MARVELLOUS THE 
OLDER PEOPLE 
ALLOTMENTS MAYBE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OLD THIS 
YEAR BUT THIS ANCIENT TRADITION 
CAN TRACE ITS ROOTS BACK TO THE 
MIDDLE AGES THE HUMBLE ALLOTMENT 
FINDS ITSELF BACK IN FASHION ONCE 
AGAIN AGAIN NOTHING LIKE A BIT OF OLD RHUBARB

BICYCLE CLIPS JUST FOR YOU A YOU 
KEEP PROMISING YOU'RE GOING TO 
CYCLE INTO THE STUDIO 
ONE DAY WHAT DO YOU MAKE ABOUT 
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE MARKET 
THE MARKET HAD A GOOD RALLY FROM 
THE LOWS OF MID MARCH WE HAVE GOT 
SEVEN HUNDRED POINTS IT IS QUITE NATURAL THE 
MARKET SHOULD COME OFF A LITTLE BIT 
PEOPLE ARE FEELING A BIT NERVOUS L. L. 
THINK IS QUITE NATURAL WE HAVE A 
BIT OF A SETBACK 
WE'RE GENUINELY ONE OF THE BIG 
PLAYERS IN THE STOCKMARKET JUPITER 
AND YOU HAVE THE BOSS HOW MUCH 
MONEY DO YOU CONTROL CUE MARK 
GIBRIL LOOKS AFTER ABOUT EIGHTEEN 
MILLION MILLION JUPITER'S WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF 
INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS

WEIGHT OF SO MANY INVESTORS MOVERS 
OF THE WEEK ON THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED THESE 
ARE THE BIG GAINS 
ENTERPRISE INNS IS GOING UP BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE PERMISSION TO GO INTO A 
LOWER TAX STATUS WITH THE MICHAEL 
THEY CAN RENT RE THEN 
REDISTRIBUTE 
THIS IS ACTUALLY A DIFFERENT VIEW 
OF POP GROUPS THE BEER IS ALMOST 
INCIDENTAL THEY ARE LARGE PROPERTY 
COMPANY SECURE YES 
FOOD IS IMPORTANT THE WRINKLE THEY 
HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH IS THE 
BANNING OF SMOKING NOW AS THEY 
BECOME AN INCOME PLAYER SOME 
INVESTORS ARE QUITE ATTRACTED 
THE PROPERTY ITSELF WE HAVE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT HUGE PROBLEMS IN THE 
PROPERTY MARKET NOW THEY'RE MORE 
PROPERTY FOCUSED THEIR SHARES BILL 
UP CUE MATT PART OF THE STATIST IS 
THEY ARE STILL LOOKING THROUGH BUT 
CARLAW WHILE DUCK MACRO THEY HAVE 
FOUND SOME WHILE 
THEY HAVE FOUND IT OFF THE WEST 
COAST OF GALON 
IT IS A MAJOR 
COMPANY IF THEY FIND WHILE IT 
MAKES AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE 
THIS IS DIFFERENT COMPANY FROM B. P. 
AND SHELL IN THAT IT IS BASICALLY 
AN EXPLORER IF IT STRIKES A MILE 
FEARED IT CAN MAKE HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY MONEY MUCH MORE HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD 
B. P. AND SHELL DO EVERYTHING FROM 
FINDING OIL TO RETAILING AT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
THE MINING SECTOR IT HAS HAD SUCH 
AN AMAZING RUN AT YOU GO IF ONLY I 
HAD INVESTED THREE YEARS AGO I 
WOULD BE A MILLIONAIRE BUT NOW 
MAYBE IT IS TOO LATE WHAT IS YOUR 
VIEW VIEW IN THE LAST FEW YEARS A LOT OF 
THESE COMPANIES HAVE DONE WELL 
BECAUSE PRICES OF LOT OF MINERALS 
HAVE GONE UP A LOT THIS IS BECAUSE 
OF DEMAND IN EMERGING MARKET 
COUNTRIES I THINK IT WILL HAVE AN 
ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN WORLDWIDE THEN 
HE SHOULD EXPECT SOME OF THESE 
COMMODITIES TO COME OFF LONGER 
TERM BEATING TWO OF THREE MILLION 
PEOPLE DEVELOPING AND WANTING TO 
BECOME AS WEALTHY AS US THEY NEED 
RESOURCES WHICH THESE COMPANIES 
PRODUCE PRODUCE THE POOR PERFORMERS OVER THE WEEK 
WHAT HIGHLIGHTS CUE MATCH MUTUAL IS 
A LARGE INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE 
COMPANY COMPANY OLD MUTUAL 
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE RESULTS 
AND HOW THEIR ASSET MANAGEMENT 
TARGETS MIGHT NOT BE QUITE AS GOOD 
AS THEY EXPECTED SIX MONTHS AGO 
THAT IS BECAUSE OF A WEAK MARKET 
SHIRE PHARMACEUTICALS IS DRUG 
SPECIFIC B. SKY B. WILL KNOW WE ALL 
KNOW I THINK THAT IS PARTLY OUT OF 
THE CONCERN THEY ARE BEST THING A 
LOT OF MONEY IN IT BROADBAND 
PEOPLE WANT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND IF 
THERE IS A SLOWDOWN IN THE U. K. ARE 
PEOPLE GOING BACK TO THE B. B. C. FOR

CONSUMING ISSUES THIS WEEK WE ARE 
LOOKING AT EMPLOYMENT TO ANSWER 
YOUR QUESTIONS WE ARE JOINED BY 
GREG PAINE FROM THE 
ARMCHAIRADVICE.CO.UK 
TONY HAS WRITTEN MY WOIF WORKS IN A 
SHOP WHERE THE TEMPERATURE LEVEL 
IS UNCOMFORTABLE WHAT ACTION 
SHOULD SHE TAKE WHAT ACTION SHOULD 
THE MANAGEMENT TAKE AIR 
CONDITIONING IS ONLY ONE HUNDRED 
IT IS A 
RELEVANT QUESTION GIVEN THE 
UNSEASONAL WARM WEATHER WE ARE 
HAVING AT THE MOMENT THE PROBLEM 
IS ALTHOUGH THERE IS A MINIMUM 
TEMPERATURE SET IN THE U. K. IT IS 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN CELSIUS THERE IS NO MAXIMUM 
SET THE HEALTH AND IT IS SIXTEEN 
CELSIUS THERE IS NO MAXIMUM SET 
IT IS SUGGESTED THE RANGE SHOULD BE 
BETWEEN THIRTEEN I THINK WORKING IN THIRTY 
WOULD BE A WOULD BE AN UNPLEASANT 
EXPERIENCE THE ONLY ANSWER IS FOR 
YOUR CORRESPONDENT TO TALK TO THE 
MANAGEMENT ABOUT IT SHE CANNOT 
WALK OUT IF THAT HAPPENED THAT 
COULD WELL BE CONSIDERED UNOFFICIAL 
INDUSTRIAL ACTION IF SHE SPEAKS TO 
THE MANAGEMENT AND SAYS WHAT IS A 
REASONABLE RANGE THIRTY DEGREES IS NOT 
THE TEMPERATURE YOU WOULD LIKE TO 
WORK IN ON A REGULAR BASIS AND SEE 
WHAT PERIMETERS CAN BE REACHED ANY 
REASONABLE EMPLOYER WOULD AGREE THIRTY 
CELSIUS IS TOO HOT PROVIDE SOME 
ALTERNATIVES AS SHE SAYS AIR 
CONDITIONING IS NOT A HUGE COST 
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU 
TAKE ON THE BOSS DOES THE BOSS 
WORK IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT OR 
ARE THEY IN AN OFFICE AROUND THE 
BACK 
IN A COOLED OFFICE AROUND THE BACK CORNER WHILE OTHER WORKERS ARE 
LABOURING AWAY 
ALEX SAYS WHAT IS 
THE LAW REGARDING EMPLOYMENT 
REFERENCES I HAD A BAD REF FROM A 
SCHOOL WHICH I AND OTHERS LEFT L. 
HAD BEEN IN A POST FOR A MONTH 
THEN A REFERENCE ARRIVED LATE AS A 
RESULT OF WHICH I WAS DISMISSED ON 
THE SPOT IT IS A BAD REFERENCE L. 
AM A SINGLE PARENT OF THREE 
CHILDREN I FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT 
TO GET ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT 
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THIS 
REFERENCE WHAT CAN I DO 
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT UNDER THE 
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT YOU ARE 
ALLOWED TO SEE THE REFERENCE WHICH 
YOUR EMPLOYER CAN GIVE YOU ALSO TO 
CHALLENGE IT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU 
BELIEVE IT IS UNTRUE THAT IS WHY 
MANY EMPLOYERS NOWADAYS WILL NOT 
GIVE A DETAILED REFERENCE THEY SAY 
THAT SO AND SO WAS EMPLOYED BY THIS 
COMPANY AND FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF 
TIME I THINK HE SHOULD ANSWER TO 
SEE THE REFERENCE CHECK IT OUT IF 
IT IS NOT TRUE CHALLENGE IT 
BECAUSE IT IS WORKING WITH CHILDREN 
OBVIOUSLY THERE F. THERE IS ANYTHING 
WHICH MIGHT COMPROMISE THE SAFETY 
OF CHILDREN THEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY 
ON THE HEAD TEACHER TO MAKE THAT 
KNOWN TO THE FUTURE EMPLOYER HE 
SHOULD CHECK IT OUT IF HE THINKS 
IT IS WRONG CHALLENGE IT WOULD 
RECOMMEND GETTING IN TEACH WITH AN 
EMPLOYMENT LAW SOLICITOR 
I RANG 
THE DEPARTMENT OF WORK AND PENSIONS 
IF HE GOES DOWN YOUR SUGGESTED 
ROUTE THERE WOULD BE A GAP WHILE 
HE GOES THROUGH ALL OF THIS THEY 
SAY YOU HAVE EACH CASE IS 
DIFFERENT YOU SHOULD GO TO THE 
JOBCENTRE PLUS OFFICE YOU MAY BE 
ELIGIBLE FOR THE NEW DEAL FOR LOAN 
PARENTS HELPING TO FIND WORK YOU 
SHOULD ASK ABOUT TAX CHILD TAX 
CREDITS THERE ARE SOME FREE MALES 
THERE IS MORE TO DO FOR ALEX THERE 
THIS ONE SAY I HAD TO TAKE 
EMERGENCY LEAVE FROM WORK TO LOOK 
AFTER MY SICK CHILD L. APPLIED FOR 
EMERGENCY LEAVE MY EMPLOYER HAS 
SAID IT IS ANNUAL HOLIDAY LEAVE 
THAT IS UNUSUAL COMPASSIONATE 
LEAVE IS LIKE SICK LEAVE THERE IS 
A LIMIT IN TERMS OF WHAT MANY 
COMPANIES ALLOW YOU DON'T MENTION 
HOW MANY DAYS' LEAVE THEY HAVE 
TAKEN PERHAPS IT EXCEEDED THEIR 
COMPANY POLICY THERE WHAT WOULD BE 
STRANGE IS FOR THE EMPLOYER TO SAY 
NO WE ARE NOT GIVING YOU 
COMPASSIONATE LEAVE WITHOUT 
DISCUSSING IT L. SUGGEST THEY SPEAK 
TO H. R. AND GET SOME CLARIFICATION ON 
IT I THINK ALSO WHEN THERE ARE TWO 
PARENTS INVOLVED EMPLOYERS EXPECT 
THE BURDEN OF CARE TO BE SHARED 
BETWEEN THE TWO PARENTS IF ONE 
PARTNER HAS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY 
ON A REGULAR BASIS PERHAPS THIS IS 
SOMETHING WHICH IS CONCERNING THEM 
AND OUGHT TO BE SPOKEN ABOUT WITH 
THE H. R. DEPARTMENT 
YOU ARE A 
DIALOGUE PERSON YOU SAY GO AND 
TALK 
A. B. S. LOUTLY L. THINK DIALOGUE TALK AND NEGOTIATION HAS TO BE THE 
ANSWER IT IS VERY VERY RARE THAT 
EMPLOYERS ARE SO INTRANSIGENT THEY 
ARE NOT PREPARED TO LISTEN TO 
SOMEONE WHO IS EXPERIENCING HARD 
TIMES 
SPREAD MORE WISDOM IN A TIMES MINUTE ADAM WILL DO HIS BIT AS 
WELL RACHEL ELNAUGH SHOT TO FAME 
AS THE FOUNDER OF RED LETTER DAYS 
IT WAS TO GIVE PEOPLE GIFT 
EXPERIENCES SUCH AS DRIVING TANKS 
PARACHUTE JUMPING AS A RESULT OF 
HER SUCCESS SHE WAS INVITED TO BE 
ONE OF THE FIRST DRAGONS ON 
DRAGON'S DEN THERE SHE IS A ROSE 
BETWEEN FOUR THORNSMENT THEN THINGS 
STARTED TO GO WRONG WHEN RED LETTER 
DAYS WENT INTO ADMINISTRATION SHE 
HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT THE 
EXPERIENCE OF LOSING HER COMPANY 
AND WHAT LESSONS IT LEAVES FOR NEW 
ENTREPRENEURS HER BOOK IS CALLED 
BUSINESS NIGHTMARES RACHEL JOINS 
US NOW THANK YOU YOU DESCRIBED 
YOUR COMPANY GOING INTO MELTDOWN L. 
WONDER WHAT WAS WORSE WAS IT THE 
FACT THAT YOU LOST THE COMPANY AND 
PROBABLY A LOT OF MONEY AND TIME 
AND EFFORT OR THE FACT THAT IT 
HAPPENED SO MUCH IN THE PUBLIC EYE 
YOU WERE ON A PROGRAMME GIVING OUT 
ADVICE AND MONEY TO ENTREPRENEURS 
YOU WERE IN THE POSITION OF POWER 
AND THEN IT WAS THE SITUATION WHO 
IS THIS WOMAN SHE HAS LOST HER 
BUSINESS 
IT WAS AWFUL NEGATIVETY BUSINESS ON PART OF THE PRESS ON THE OTHER 
HAND ACTUALLY IT WAS LIBERATING L. 
HAD FOUGHT FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS 
TO SAVE THE BUSINESS WHEN I LET GO 
ACTUALLY I KIND OF HAD MY LIFE BACK 
AND LOTS OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES 
FLOWED IN THERE WERE SOME POSITIVE 
THINGS 
YOU TALK IN THE BOOK ABOUT THINGS HOW FAILURE CAN BE A POSITIVE THING 
YOU LEARN FROM YOUR EXPERIENCES 
PEOPLE PICK THEMSELVES UP AND 
REBUILD ENTERPRISES L. KNOW JERRY 
RATER IN IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE YOU 
SPOKE TO WHAT RATNER IS ONE OF 
THE PEOPLE YOU SPOKE TO WHAT 
LESSONS ARE THERE TO AVOID 
WE GOT 
TO A TURNOVER OF TEN MILLION AND 
MADE ABOUT ONE MILLION PROFIT L. 
THINK WE GOT OVER CONFIDENT AND GO 
FOR GOLD L. BROUGHT IN EXTERNAL C. E. O. 
AND STEPPED BACK FROM THE DAY TO 
DAY RUNNING L. THINK WE TRIED TO 
PUSH IT TOO FAR TOO FAST AND ENDED 
UP WITH A FORTY SEVEN MILLION LOSS WHICH 
IS A LOT TO RECOVER FROM FOR A 
SMALL BUSINESS 
IN THE U. S. I WAS 
HEARING THERE IS A DIFFERENT 
PHILOSOPHY ABOUT ENTREPRENEURS 
THAT PEOPLE DO FAIL THEY SET UP A 
BUSINESS IT DOES NOT WORK IT 
COLLAPSES THEY PICK THEMSELVES UP 
AND BUILD SOMETHING NEW THAT 
PREVIOUS FAILURE IS SEEN AS PART OF 
THE LEARNING KURVE MY IMPRESSION 
IS THAT IS DIFFERENT IN THE U. K. IT 
IS SEEN AS A NEGATIVE SOMETHING TO 
BE ASHAMED OF AND WE DON'T WANT TO 
SEE YOU AGAIN GO AWAY IS THAT 
TRUE IN YOUR EXPERIENCE 
VERY MUCH 
SO WE HAVE A VERY NEGATIVE VIEW OF 
FAILURE IT IS A REAL SHAME IT 
STOPS PEOPLE FROM TRYING SO PEOPLE 
END UP PLAYING SAFE BECAUSE THEY 
DON'T WANT TO FAIL IT IS A REAL 
SHAME WE ARE NOT MORE LIKE THE U. S. 
WHERE WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE YOU 
LEARN A LOT MORE FROM A BUSINESS 
MELTDOWN ACTUALLY I LEARNT MORE IN 
THOSE TWO AND A HALF YEARS THAN THE 
PREVIOUS ENTIRE DECADE THERE IS A 
LOT OF VALUE TO THAT EXPERIENCE IN IN THIS BOOK YOU SPOKE TO EVERYARCHER 
MR. RATNER IS THERE ANY THEMES 
WHICH JOIN THE PEOPLE YOU SPOKE TO 
IT IS THE STORIES OF TWENTY DIFFERENT 
ENTREPRENEURS SOME I INTERVIEWED 
OTHERS I RESEARCHED THEIR STORIES 
THE COMMON THEME WAS WHEN THEY 
ENCOUNTERED ADVERSE IT ISTY IN 
THEIR BUSINESS CAREER THEY 
ACTUALLY STAYED INCREDIBLY POSITIVE 
SOMETIMES IT IS THAT HOPE AND FAITH 
AND OPTIMISM WHICH BRING YOU 
SOLUTIONS NOT ALL OF THEM FELL 
OVER THE CLIFF A LOT OF THEM 
PULLED IT BACK FROM THE BRINK 
OFTEN AT THE LAST MOMENT IT IS A 
FINE LINE BETWEEN SUCCESS AND 
FAILURE 
WHEN YOU WERE A GIRL FAILURE RATHER THAN PLAYOUT SIDE YOU WOULD 
SIT COUNTING MONEY IN YOUR PARENT'S 
SHOP 
IT SOUND SAD TO ME IT WAS 
GREAT FUN 
YOU PLAYED SHOP FOR REAL 
IT WAS A GREAT CHILDHOOD ACTUALLY 
IS THAT SOMETHING ELSE WHICH BRINGS 
TOGETHER THOSE PEOPLE YOU HAVE 
INTERVIEWED SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS 
PEOPLE ALWAYS HAD IT IN THEM IN A 
AS A CHILD 
THEY ARE DIFFERENT 
THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT 
MAYBE A DROPOUT AT SCHOOL AND DON'T 
FIT IN THE NORM IT IS BEING 
DIFFERENT AND BEING INNOVATIVE AND 
TO BE BOLD AND STAND OUT THAT 
ACTUALLY MAKES YOU GOOD AT BUSINESS 
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PUSH THE 
BOUNDARIES A BIT 
BEST OF LUCK WITH 
YOUR BOUNCE BACK THANK YOU GOOD 
LUCK WITH THE BOOK L. WANT TO TALK 
R. U. BARD WE SHOWED A CHILD PULLING 
R. U. BARD YOU HAVE TO TWIST AND PULL 
JUST TWISTING CAN DAMAGE THE CROWN 
THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WANTED TO 
SEE THOUSANDS OF WIND TURBINES 
AROUND OUR COASTS DELIVERING ONE 
THIRD OF OUR ELECTRICITY NOW THOSE 
EXPANSION PLANS COULD BE IN DOUBT 
THE BUILDER OF THE LARGEST WIND 
FARM CENTRICA SAID IF COSTS 
CONTINUE TO RISE FUTURE PROJECTS 
MAY NOT BE VIABLE 
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT GREEN 
ENERGY RENEWABLE ENERGY IN FACT 
BRITAIN IS GOING TO NEED A HECK OF 
A LOT OF GREEN RENEWABLE ENERGY IN 
THE FUTURE IF IT WILL MEET ITS 
TARGETS FOR CUTTING CARBON 
EEMISSIONS WHERE IS ALL THIS GREEN 
CLEAN ENERGY GOING TO COME FROM IT 
IS SIX THIRTY A M. WE HAVE LEFT GRIMSBY 
DOCKS ON THE EAST COAST AND WED ARE 
HEADING OUT TO SEE WHAT MANY PEOPLE 
BELIEVE COULD BE THE FUTURE OF 
GREEN CLEAN ENERGY FOR BRITAIN 
WE HAVE COME ABOUT AN HOUR AND A 
HALF DOWN THE COAST FROM GRIMSBY TO 
THIS IT IS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST 
OFF SHORE WIND FARM CURRENTLY 
BEING CONSTRUCTED FOUR MILES OFF OF 
THE COAST OF SKEGNESS THERE'LL BE 
FIFTY TURBINES HERE IT IS ONLY WHEN 
YOU GET UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH 
ONE OF THEM THAT YOU SEE HOW BIG 
THEY ARE THAT IS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY METRES TALL 
THAT ALONE CAN PROVIDE ENOUGH 
ENERGY TO POWER TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HOMESMENT 
THESE TURBINES ARE BEING 
COMMISSIONED THEY ARE BEING 
SWITCHED ON IF YOU LIKE THERE IS A 
MAINTENANCE BOAT THERE AT THE 
MOMENT THIS ONE WILL BE ON LINE 
BUT WHY BUILD OFF SHORE WIND FARMS 
THE MAIN REASON IS YOU CAN OPERATE 
ON A BIGGER SCALE THAN YOU CAN BACK 
ON LAND BUILDING OUT HERE IS MORE 
EXPENSIVE WHERE WOULD YOU PUT YOUR 
WIND FARM YOU NEED A LOCATION WITH 
A LOT OF WIND THERE IS LOTS OF 
THAT HERE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE 
ANYWHERE TOO DEEP THE SEA BED HERE 
IS JUST TEN METRES DOWN THE U. K. HAS 
GOT HUNDREDS OF MILES OF COASTLINE 
THAT IS WHY SUPPORTERS OF OFF SHORE 
WIND BELIEVE WE HAVE A UNIQUE 
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THIS WIND GENERATION 
THERE IS IS A PROBLEM THE COST OF 
BUILDING OFF SHORE WIND FARMS IS 
ESCALATING SOME WONDER WHETHER IT 
WILL BE THE ANSWER TO SOLVING 
BRITAIN'S RENEWABLE ENERGY ISSUES 
IN THE FUTURE JOINING ME IS 
SOMEONE FROM BRITISH GAS WHY IS 
BRITISH GAS IN THE WIND BUSINESS 
WE PROVIDE 
ELECTRICITY TO OUR CUSTOMERS 
WE HAVE TO PLAY OUR ROLE IN MEETING 
THE COMMITMENT SET BY THE 
GOVERNMENT 
WITHIN THE LAST EIGHTEEN GOVERNMENT MONTHS TO TWO YEARS T. COST OF 
PUTTING UP THESE WIND FARMS HAS 
ESCALATED 
THE MATERIALS REQUIRED ESCALATED TO BUILD THESE STRUCTURES STEEL 
COOPER THEY HAVE GONE UP AND SO 
AS CONSTRUCTION COSTS HAVE RISEN 
THE ECONOMICS ARE NOT AS GOOD AS 
THEY WERE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE 
SIGNED CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS FOR 
THIS WIND FARM 
JUST LAST WEEK WE 
SAW A MAJOR INVESTOR SHELL PULL 
OUT OF A WIND POWER PROJECT OFF THE 
COAST OF KENT ARE THESE GOING TO 
BE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE IN THE 
FUTURE 
IF WE LOOK AT THE ECONOMICS FUTURE OF A PROJECT THE RETURNS ARE 
MARGINAL ON THAT BASIS WE WOULD 
STILL INVEST THE WORRYING TREND IS 
IF COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE AND 
PROJECTS BECOME ABSOLUTELY 
UNECONOMIC THEN I THINK THE TARGET 
OF BUILDING THIRTY THREE GIGGA WATTS OF OFF 
SHORE WIND 
AT THE END OF THE YEAR IT SHOULD BE 
PROVIDING ENOUGH TO POWER HALF OF 
LINCOLNSHIRE BY THEN THE U. K. WOULD 
HAVE OVERTAKEN DENMARK AS THE 
WORLD'S LEADING OFF SHORE WIND 
NATION THAT IS EVIDENCE ACCORDING 
TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT INCENTIVES 
AT BUILDING MORE COMPANIES TO BUILD 
RENEWABLE ENERGY ARE WORKING 
BEFORE WE GET TO THE WEEK AHEAD I 
HAVE HAD AN E. MAIL FROM YOUR OF 
ERRORS AND CUSTOMER OF VIEWERS 
THEY HAVE RECEIVED A STATEMENT FOR 
THE CHINA FUND CAN YOU ON THE 
CHINESE MARKET WHICH APPEARS TO 
HAVE PLUMMETED SINCE FAVOURITE 
HE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE CHINESE 
MARKET HAS PLUMMETED 
IT HAS FALLEN FORTY PER CENT OR FIFTY PER CENT OVER 
WHAT PERIOD 
TWO T. THREE MONTHS WHAT ONE HAS TO 
REMEMBER ABOUT EMERGING MARKETS 
THE KEY THING FOR INVESTORS TO 
REMEMBER IS THAT YOU NEED TO HOLD 
THESE FUNDS FOR THE MEDIUM TERM 
THESE MARKETS ARE VOLATILE HOLD 
YOUR NERVE CHINA IS GROWING AT TEN 
PER CENT PER YEAR AND WE THINK THERE ARE 
GOING TO BE GOOD POT BUT TO BE MADE 
BUT THERE WILL BE VOLATILE IN THE 
MEANTIME MEANTIME ONE OTHER THING THAT STRIKES ME AS 
INTERESTING IS THAT WE KEEP TALKING 
ABOUT THE CHINESE MARKET BEING SUCH 
A HUGE ECONOMY AT SIMILAR PERIOD 
THE JAPANESE ECONOMY HAD 
INTERNATIONAL BRANDS THE WE KNEW 
MOST PEOPLE COULD NOT NAME THE 
CHINESE BRAND 
IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT STATE THERE 
ARE SOME OF THESE DIFFERENCES 
CHINA IS BUT BIGGER GEOGRAPHICALLY 
MUCH BIGGER GEOGRAPHICAL 
GEOGRAPHIC T. IT HAS NOT GOT TO THE 
STAGE OF TOYOTA A OR SONY IN JAPAN 
THAT IS PARTLY WHY THEY'RE STARTING 
TO BUY WESTERN COMPANIES THEY 
BOUGHT ROVER AND THEY BOUGHT I. B. M.'S 
P. C. BUSINESS 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE WEEK AHEAD 
ON MONDAY THERE ARE FIGURES FROM 
CENTRICA AND IT SHOULD BE H. S. B. C. 
LET US HAVE LOOK AT TUESDAY A A WHOLE RANGE OF COMPANIES THE 
BIGGEST IS H. S. B. C. CLEARLY WHAT IS 
GOING BE IMPORTANT IS WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IN THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
H. S. B. C. HAS SUFFERED A VERY WELL THEY 
HAVE A HAT TO RAISE MONEY LIKE SOME 
OTHER BANKS INVESTORS WILL BE 
INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING 
THEY HAVE NOT HAD TO RAISE MONEY 
THEY HAVE A VERY BIG EXPOSURE IN 
THE FAR EAST AN INTERESTING 
INSIGHT INTO THE BANKING MARKET WE 
TALKED ABOUT ENTERPRISE IN GREAT 
RETAILER OF HOT DOGS AND ROLLS 
SAUSAGE ROLLS ACTUALLY 
ENTERPRISE INNS OUR GREAT ABLE TO 
PASS ON THEIR RAW MATERIAL PRICE 
INCREASES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT 
IS NOT CLEAR GIVEN THAT PRICES OF 
FUEL THAT IS GOING TO AFFECT 
BUSINESS BUSINESS LET US HAVE LOOK AT THE SECOND 
HALF OF THE WEEK GRAB A COUPLE 
THERE 
FIRST GROUP AIR INTERESTING THERE DIVERSIFIED TRANSPORT GROUP OUR 
PEOPLE MOVING FROM THEIR CARS TO 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT JOHNSTON PRESS 
MAYBE LESS FAMILIAR TO PEOPLE BUT 
THEY DON'T BIG REGIONAL NEWSPAPERS 
SOME OF THEIR EARNINGS COME FROM 
ADVERTISING 
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING ADVERTISING AT ON THURSDAY B. T. BRIT B. T. FOR 
EXAMPLE IN A WE WANT IS SEE WHAT 
THEY'RE DOING IN BROADBAND AND WHAT 
IS HAPPENING TO THEIR CUSTOMERS 
WE'RE PRETTY RUBBISH AT RECYCLING 
OUR FOOD WASTE THAT WAS THE 
CONCLUSION OF STUDY RELEASED 
EARLIER THIS WEEK WHEN IT COMES TO 
GARDEN WASTE WE DO LOT BETTER BG BG NO THIS IS COMPOSTER AWARENESS 
WEEK DID YOU KNOW THIS IS 
COMPOST AWARENESS WEEK WE WENT TO 
MEET ONE OF THE U. K.'S LARGEST 
COMPOSTER HAS 
IT IS DELIVERY TIME AT ONE OF THIS 
COMPANY'S FOR SITE IN OXFORDSHIRE 
THE COMPANY TURNS GARDEN WASTE INTO 
COMPOST IT 
IS A 
GROWING INDUSTRY 
IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND TONNE OF COMPOST 
WERE PRODUCED THE INCREASE HAS 
BEEN SPURRED ON BY EUROPEAN 
LEGISLATION TO DISCOURAGE LANDFILL 
THE LEGISLATION MEANS ENORMOUS 
FINES THESE FINES WERE CASCADED 
DOWN TO EVERY LOCAL UP ROT BUSY 
WORKING TO AVOID THESE FANS FINDS 
BUT ALSO IMPORTANTLY TO 
CONTRIBUTE A VERY SIGNIFICANT 
AMOUNT AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT 
COUNCILS GET FINED AROUND TWO HUNDRED A 
TONNE IF THEY EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF 
WASTE THEY PUT IN LANDFILL THIS 
COMPANY WORKS WITH COUNCILS AND 
HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY AND MACHINERY 
THIS IS WHERE WE BREAK MATERIAL UP 
IT IS CALLED ASH WRITER A 
SHREDDER IMPORTANT TO GET THE 
RIGHT SIZE 
THIS MACHINE IS THE SECOND PROCESS 
IT HAS GOT A TERRIFIC CAPACITY IT 
WOULD GENERALLY TURN AROUND ONCE 
EVERY TWO WEEKS IT AND THERE'S THE 
TEMPERATURE HERE AS WELL WILL SEVENTY 
DEGREES THE IMPORTANT TO GET HIGH 
TEMPERATURES FOR AT LEAST TWO THREE 
DAYS WHEN HIS MATERIAL GOES INTO 
BAGS THERE WILL BE ANY WEEDS OR SEE 
IT IN IT 
THIS IS GIANT MECHANICAL SIP THAT 
SEPARATE THE COMPOST FROM THE 
MATERIAL THAT HAS NOT COME BUT 
HAS NOT GOT COMPOST AND NEEDS TO BE 
COMPOSTED THE FINAL PRODUCT IS 
READY TO GO ON THE FARMER'S FIELD 
THERE ARE FOUR THOUSAND TONNES OF MATERIAL 
ON THIS SIDE AT ANY GIVEN TIME IT 
TAKES TWELVE WEEKS BUT THE PROCESS TO 
BE COMPLETE AT THE END OF THAT NINETY 
PER CENT OF THE COMPOST GOES TO LOCAL 
FARMERS THEY PAY IN COMPOST THE 
SELLING OF THE COMPOST IS ONLY PART 
OF THE REVENUE'S GREEN COUNCILS 
PAID IT IN NINETEEN AND THIRTY PER TONNE FOR 
COMPANIES TO TAKE GARDEN WASTE OF 
THEM AFTER IT HAS BEEN TURNED INTO 
COMPOST FARMERS BUY IT FOR TWO PER 
TONNE THE SMALL AMOUNT GOES TO 
LANDSCAPE GARDENERS SELLS FOR 
NEARLY TWENTY PER TONNE THE PRICE 
DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE FARMERS BY IN 
BALL AND A RELATIVELY AN EASY LOCAL 
MARKET FOR A PROTEST PROCESSES 
NINETY PER CENT OF CONSUL COUNCILS COLLECT 
GARDEN WASTE IT IS POSSIBLE TO 
MAKE A WRONG COMPOST IN A PLASTIC 
BIN 
IT ALSO PUT THE PEELINGS FROM BIN YOUR HOUSE AND CARDBOARD GREAT 
COMPOST YOU HAVE TO SIT IT TO PUT 
IT THERE AND YOU LONG TO SIT IT 
IT IS REALLY GOOD AT HOLDING THE 
MOISTURE IN THIS WELL 
DO I NEED TO 
TURN UP FIRST DEREK 
IN THE BEEN SEE WHAT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN FROM THE TOP AND PRICE AT THREE 
YEAR STIRRUP UP TO MAKE SURE YOU 
HAVE GOT IT WELL MIXED IT WILL 
COMPOST DOWN 
HERE IN OXFORDSHIRE THERE ARE KEEN 
TO TAKE THEIR COMPOSTING PROCESS 
EVEN FURTHER THE NEXT STAGE IS TO 
INCORPORATE FOOD WASTE INVESTMENT 
WILL BE NEEDED WITH EUROPEAN 
LEGISLATION GETTING STRICTER AND 
COUNCILS KEEN TO IMPROVE THEIR 
GREEN CREDENTIALS IT WILL NOT BE 
LONG BEFORE COMPOSTING HIS BIG 
BUSINESS IF EUROPE IS A STUDIES 
DUKE BUSINESS STUDIES STUDENT 
KNEW WHAT THAT REPORT AGAIN EVEN 
GOT OUR WEBSITE AND YOU WANT TO 
WATCH THAT REPORT AGAIN NOW FOR 
MORE OF HER CONSUMING ISSUES ALL 
OF THAT EMPLOYMENT WITH RED PAINT 
FROM THE AMATEUR ADVICE WEBSITE 
AND THAT SAYS SHE WORKS IN A LARGE 
CHAIN RESTAURANT ALL THE WAITING 
STAFF ARE PAID FOUR POINT ONE OH THE TRUNK IS 
BASICALLY CREDIT CARD TO IT 
MANAGERS REGULARLY GET BONUSES WILL 
STACK UP SEEN NOTHING EVEN THOUGH 
THE WORK OF THIS HER 
TRUNK IS LEGAL AND A LONG 
ESTABLISHED SYSTEM WITHIN THE 
CATERING INDUSTRY THE REVENUE 
DEPARTMENT EVEN INCORPORATE P. A. WHY 
YOU BUT I THINK THE ISSUE OF 
MANAGERS GETTING BONUSES RELATED TO 
THE WORK THEY DO AGAIN IN ANY 
INDUSTRY I HAVE COME ACROSS 
MANAGES GET BONUSES GENERALLY 
RELATED TO THE PROFITABILITY OF THE 
COMPANY RATHER THAN TIPS 
WE DID 
HEAR FROM UNION LEADERS HE SAID 
THERE IS MORE THAT CAN BE DONE IN 
THIS AREA IT IS COLLECTIVE ACTION 
RATHER THAN AN HOUR ON HER OWN I I THINK IT IS CERTAINLY LEGAL BUT 
WHETHER IT IS ETHICAL IS CERTAINLY 
A MOOT POINT 
THE GUY FROM THE 
TRADE UNION SO THE MANAGER AND 
ASKED WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MONEY 
IT IS ABOUT CONSUMERS TAKING 
RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL AS EMPLOYERS 
HELLO RIGHT IN TO SAY SHE HAS JUST 
BEEN WATCHING ABOUT THERE BEING 
MORE ALTHOUGH PEOPLE AND CHILDREN 
HOW WOULD THIS BE PAID FOR IN THE 
FUTURE SHE SUGGESTS GETTING 
EMPLOYERS TO STOP BEING SO 
DESPERATE TO EMPLOY BE THE TWENTY FOURTH AND 
START TAKING ON THE OVER FIFTIES 
WHAT IS BEING DONE TO PROMOTE 
EMPLOYMENT EMPLOYMENT ATTITUDES ARE CERTAINLY CHANGING 
FIFTY IS NOW THE NEW FORTY THINK THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS RECOGNISED THIS AND 
THAT THE LEGISLATION IT PROHIBITS 
AGE DISCRIMINATION AND ALLOWS 
PEOPLE TO WORK BE ON THE PREVIOUS 
STATUTORY RETIREMENT AGE OF SIXTY FIVE 
BEYOND PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES WILL 
FOLLOW AN INCREASING NUMBER OF 
WEBSITE HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY SET 
UP TO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT FOR THE 
OVER FIFTIES I THINK PEOPLE ARE 
COMING TO APPRECIATE MORE THE 
EXPERIENCE IT IS WELL WORTHWHILE 
B. AND AMP Q. HAVE A STRATEGY OF AND FIND 
OLDER PEOPLE 
BECAUSE THEY KNOW A 
LOT MORE ABOUT HOW IT COULD DO 
THINGS 
ABSOLUTELY THEY HAVE THE THINGS LIVE EXPERIENCE THEY HAVE THE 
KNOWLEDGE I HOPE OTHER COMPANIES 
WILL FOLLOW 
YOU'RE HORRIBLY 
YOUTHFUL YOU CANNOT BALLS LIKE 
THAT AND GET AWAY WITH IT CAROLINE 
WORKS IN A LARGE FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTION AND THE CITY OF LONDON

THEY COULD BE ACCUSED OF UNFAIR 
DISMISSAL THEY SHOULD OFFER HER A
