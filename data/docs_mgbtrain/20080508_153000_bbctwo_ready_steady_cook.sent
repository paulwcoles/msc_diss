GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON BIG FAN OF THE SHOW YEAH 
GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK OUR CHEFS HOW DO YOU MAKE A GOOD SAUCE 
FOR LIKE MACARONI CHEESE 
I LOVE THIS WITH MACARONI CHEESE MAKE A TOMATO SAUCE A CAN OF CHOPPED TOMATOES 
A BIT OF OLIVE OIL REDUCE IT DOWN UNTIL IT'S NICE AND THICK 
THEN GET YOUR MACARONI AND TOSS IT IN THE TOMATO SAUCE SO THE OIL GETS ABSORBED INTO THE PASTA 
INTO YOUR GRATIN DISH AND THEN MAKE A NICE QUICK WHITE SAUCE 
WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE WHITE SAUCE THING MORE BUTTER THAN FLOUR 
SO THAT IT COOKS OUT PROPERLY 
THEN CHUCK IN SOME COLD MILK WHISK IT UNTIL IT THICKENS UP LOTS OF GRATED CHEESE 
MUSTARD NICE TEASPOON OF SMOOTH GRAIN MUSTARD 
AND THEN PUT THAT OVER THE MACARONI 
WITH THE TOMATO SAUCE ON IT 
AND THAT COMBINATION OF THE TOMATO THROUGH THE PASTA AND THE CHEESE SAUCE ON TOP IS SENSATIONAL 
IT'S ALMOST BE ENOUGH FOR HIM 
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE A WHITE SAUCE GARY 
ER I HAVE DONE BUT I MADE IT ALL LUMPY WHEN I MADE IT FOR MY GIRLFRIEND ONCE 
THE SECRET IS MORE BUTTER THAN FLOUR MORE BUTTER THAN FLOUR 
SO FIFTY GRAMS IF YOU LIKE OF BUTTER TWENTY FIVE GRAMS OF PLAIN FLOUR 
MIX IT TOGETHER AND IT WILL COOK DOWN AND GET A BIT SANDY DON'T LET IT GO TOO BROWN 
AND THEN GRADUALLY POUR YOUR MILK ON TOP REALLY BEAT IT IN AS NICK SAYS 
GET THE CONSISTENCY THAT YOU WANT I LIKE THROWING IN A BIT OF HAM
