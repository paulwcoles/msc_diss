GOOD AFTERNOON FROM THE CRUCIBLE 
THE THREE OF THE EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP IS UNDER WAY THE MAIN 
DISCUSSION CONCERNS THAT TWO 
PEOPLE WHO DOMINATE THIS BOARD 
STEPHEN HENDRY AND STEVE DAVIS THE 
COMPETITIVE SPIRIT STILL BURNS 
BRIGHTLY FOR BOTH PLAYERS THE 
QUESTION IS RAISED IS THE END OF 
AN ERA APPROACHING 
IF HE LOSES TO STUART BINGHAM THIS 
COULD BE STEVE'S LAST MATCH AT THE 
CRUCIBLE 
I HAVE NO REASON TO STOP PLAYING 
EVEN THOUGH IT IS EASY TO GO YEAH 
I PLAYING IT IS A GOOD CHALLENGE 
TO SEE HOW I CAN PIT MY WITS 
AMONGST THE NEW UP AND COMING 
PLAYERS AND SEE IF I CAN HOLD MY 
OWN 
IT IS COMPLETE NONSENSE IT IS NOT 
A PHYSICAL SPORT L. AM NOT RUNNING 
TWENTY SEVEN MILES IT IS SNOOKER IF MY 
ATTITUDE IS RIGHT AND MY 
CONCENTRATION IS RIGHT I WILL BE 
EASILY CAPABLE OF WINNING THIS 
TOURNAMENT 
IT IS THREE YEARS SINCE HENDRY HAS 
WON THE TITLE OF ANY SORT RESULTS 
INDICATE THAT HIS ERA HAS PASSED 
HERE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WHO WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT THAT AT THE AGE OF FORTY SIX JACK 
NICKLAUS COULD WIN THE MASTERS 
ANYTHING IS 
POSSIBLE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE I HAVE WON IT SEVERAL 
TIMES I WON SEVEN TOURNAMENTS ONE 
SEASON THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
AGAIN THE GAME HAS CHANGED YOU YOU CAN NEVER SAY NEVER THE GAME IS SO 
COMPETITIVE THESE DAYS IT IS 
UNLIKELY TO HAVE A DOMINANT FORCE 
LIKE THAT AGAIN 
YOU WILL HAVE TO 
BE SOMEWHERE TO DOMINATE JUST LIKE 
THE BUZZARD IN THE NINETIES WHO KNOWS 
SNICKER'S TIGER WOODS COULD BE JUST 
ROUND THE CORNER JUST LIKE 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
HOW CAN THEY PAIR 
OF THEM GO ON 
IF AS LONG AS THEY 
ENJOY IT AS LONG AS THEY PLAY TO A 
STANDARD THAT THEY BELIEVE IS 
ACCEPTABLE IF THEY GET FRUSTRATED 
PLAYING THE GAME THEN THEY WILL 
SAY THAT IS ENOUGH 
WHILE THEY ARE 
STILL ENJOYING IT THEY WILL BE A 
THREAT TO ANYONE 
THEY STILL ARE 
FROM PRACTICE STEPHEN HENDRY IS 
PLAYING FANTASTICALLY STEVE IS A 
VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF THING HE 
HAS GOT AN A B. C. TYPE OF GAME 
LET US THAT AGE INTO CONTEXT

CONCENTRATION WHEN YOU PLAY TO IT

DOTT BREAKS OFF WITH JOE PERRY 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON THAT IS THE 
STATE OF PLAY SO FAR 
THAT IS THE DRESSING ROOM OF STEVE 
DAVIS GETTING READY HE IS PLAYING 
STUART BINGHAM IT IS SIX YEARS 
SINCE STUART LAST QUALIFIED THAT 
COULD BE STEVE'S WEAPON HERE THIS 
EXPERIENCE HERE EXCELLENT 
TACTICALLY HE IS BETTER THAN 
STEWART COULD HE SCORE HEAVILY 
THAT IS THE KEY 
AFTER THE OPENING 
FRAMES OF STEVE'S MATCH WE TURN 
OUR ATTENTION TO STEPHEN HENDRY 
CAN HE RECOVER 
I AM LOOKING 
FORWARD TO COMMENTATING ON MARK 
SELBY HE IS THE INFORM PLAYER HE 
IS UP AGAINST A VERY DETERMINED 
MARK KING 
ALSO THIS AFTERNOON WE 
WILL SEE IF RYAN DAY CAN GET OVER 
MICHAEL JUDGE THE SNOOKER TABLE 
STANDING AT SHEFFIELD TRAIN STATION 
GARY LINEKER WILL TELL US ABOUT HIS 
GREAT AFFECTION FOR THE GREAT GAME 
IT IS PART OF MY GROWING UP L. 
PLAYED A LOT FROM FOURTEEN ESPECIALLY 
WHEN I STARTED AT ALL USED TO 
TRAIN IN THE MORNINGS AND WE USED 
TO GET A LAW OFF THREE LOTS OF 
FREE TIME AND WE USED TO PRACTISE 
FOR HOURS AND HOURS 
WE EXPLAIN THE 
MISS RULE THE ARTIST TOM WALKER 
WILL A MASTERPIECE BEFORE OUR 
EYES FIRST UP ANOTHER MASTER OF 
WORK STEVE DAVIS SIX TIMES WORLD 
CHAMPION MADE HIS WAY TO THE TABLE 
WITH JOHN IN CLOSE ATTENDANCE WITH WITH THAT KNOCK ON THE DOOR THE LEGEND 
THAT IS STEVE DAVIS COMES OUT HE 
HAS PLAYED SEVENTEEN MATCHES OVER THE 
YEARS HE HAS WON MILLIONS IN PRIZE 
MONEY HE HAS PLAYED ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE FRAMES 
AND ME FORTY FOUR CENTURIES AT THE 
CRUCIBLES WHAT A SHOW OF PLEASE PLEASE WELCOME STEVE DAVIS 
STEWART GOT OFF TO A FLYER THERE 
IS WORK TO DO FORESEE WE JOIN THE 
MATCH FOR STEVE 
HE JUST HAS TO ROLL THIS WON HIM 
THIS WON HIM 
AMAZING JUST A SLIGHT 
MISCALCULATION WITH THE CUE ACTION 
EVERYTHING LOOKED PRETTY GOOD WITH 
THAT SHOT JUST HAVE A LOOK 
AMAZING 
IT DID NOT SURPRISE ME THE SHOT HE 
MISSED IN THE LAST FRAME HE HAS 
MISSED EASIER ONES THAN THAT 
HE WILL HAVE TO BE VERY STRONG AND 
TO PUT THOSE MISSES BEHIND HIM 
HE HAS PUT A LOT OF HARD WORK IN HE HAS NOT PUT IT INTO HIS PERFORMANCE YET HE MAY GET SOME MORE FREEDOM IN HIS CUE ARM 
I THINK HE HAS GOT TENSION IN HIS 
ARM 
HE HAS GOT ONE OF THE FINEST CUE 
ACTION IS IN THE GAME STEVE DAVIS THAT WILL DO ALL RIGHT 
NEVER SURE EXACTLY HOW THEY WILL 
WORK OUT WHEN YOU CAN THEN INTO 
THEM CANNON 
ACUTE ANGLE ON THIS RED HE CAN 
HEAD UP TO PINK AND BLUE 
THAT IS USUALLY A SIGN OF UNDER Q. 
TENSION IN THE ARM WHEN YOU KEEP 
UNDER HITTING BUT HE HAS PLAYED THAT NICELY 
HE HAS UNDER HIT ITS LIKELY BUT 
THERE IS NO PROBLEM THIS TIME HE 
WILL GET ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE 
BLUE 
I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THAT HE 
USUALLY PLAYS THE RIGHT SHOT WHEN 
YOU MOVE A RED AFTER POTTING RED YOU ARE NEVER GUARANTEED THAT THINGS WILL WORK OUT 
I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER 
LEAVING THAT CALL HIMSELF THIRTY FIVE POINTS 
THERE IS SOME DISTURBANCE WITH 
PEOPLE LEAVING STUART BINGHAM IS 
TAKING HIS TIME 
HE NORMALLY WOULD GO DOWN AND CLEAR 
UP 
THE ALIGNMENT LOOKED GOOD BUT HE 
COULD NOT DELIVER IN A STRAIGHT 
LINE 
THE WORRYING THING WHEN YOU SEE 
THIS HE IS NOT EVEN GETTING THE 
BALL INTO THE JAWS THAT IS O. K. IT WAS A GOOD SHOT THAT COULD WELL BE A FRAME WINNER THAT OPENING POT WAS A THIN ONE 
WITHOUT PLAYING ALL THAT WELL 
STUART BINGHAM HAS COMFORTABLE THREE FRAMES LEAD STEVE HAS HAD PLENTY OF CHANCES THAT WAS AROUND THE HOUSE IS SHORT 
SEEMS TO BE GROWING IN CONFIDENCE 
HE FINISHED THE FRAME OFF STUART 
BINGHAM LEADS 
THERE IS QUITE A LONG LINE OF 
PEOPLE HERE NOT A GREAT START FOR 
STEPHEN GOING INTO THE MATCH HERE 
IF YOU LOSE THIS GAME YOU WILL 
HAVE TO QUALIFY NEXT TIME ROUND 
THAT'S WHAT THE COMMENTATORS SAID 
HE HAS RESIGNED HIMSELF TO THE FACT 
THAT IS COMING HE HAS BEEN OUT THE 
TOP SIXTEEN BEFORE AND COME BACK WHAT 
HE HAS GOT A PROBLEM WITH HE WILL 
HAVE TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS MATCH 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PLANE STEVE 
PLANE HE IS MISSING SHOTS THAT HE 
DOES NOT NORMALLY MISS 
IT IS ABOUT 
CONCENTRATION IT IS BASED SECURING 
STAFF STEVE SHOULD NOT MISS IT 
IS BASIC DURING STUFF CUEING HE 
IS OFF TO A VERY BAD STAFF STORE 
HE MAY BE TRYING TOO HARD BECAUSE 
IT MEANS SO MUCH TO HIM 
THAT IS 
THE OTHER PROBLEM STEVE WILL BE 
OUT THERE WANTING TO REFORM IT IS 
NOT QUITE HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT 
STEVE'S EXPERIENCE WILL BE TELLING 
HIM I CAN PRESS THE SWISH AND GET 
IT GOING 
IF HE CAN GET HIMSELF 
INVOLVED AT THE MOMENT IT IS JUST 
NOT GOING IN 
OUR FRAME IS NOT 
HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT 
HE IS VERY 
REALISTIC AT THE MOMENT HE HAS 
NOT COME OUT THE TRAPS 
THEY US GO 
BACK TO THE MATCH STEVE GOT 
HIMSELF INTO THE GAME HE WON FRAME 
FOUR 
THIS IS THE BEST CHANCE THAT STEVE 
HAS HAD THE RENTS ARE OPEN REDS 
HE WOULD LIKE TO GET ON THE BLACK 
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER HE IS ON THE BLACK 
THAT IS THE THING WE ARE MENTIONING 
BEFORE THE INTERVAL HE IS NOT 
LETTING THAT CUE GO THROUGH WITH 
REAL FLUENCY 
IS HE O. K. I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT 
HAS FINISHED RATHER AWKWARD THERE 
IS A RED INTO THE LEFT CORNER L. 
DON'T THINK HE CAN GET ONTO THE 
BLACK IT IS NOT AVAILABLE INTO THE 
RIGHT CORNER THERE IS NO USE 
ROLLING THIS RED IN VERY CAN SEE 
IF THE RED WAS NOT BLOCKING THE 
BLACK HE COULD JUST ROLL THAT IN 
ONCE AGAIN HE HAS UNDER HIT IT 
SLIGHTLY STILL NOT EASY 
AT LEAST HE IS STRINGING A FEW POTS 
TOGETHER HE IS GROWING IN 
CONFIDENCE 
WELL PLAYED NOW I CHANCE NOW A 
CHANCE 
I MENTIONED BEFORE THE MID CHANCE SESSION INTERVAL BUT I THOUGHT 
STEPHEN HAD SHORTENED HIS CUE 
ACTION I POPPED INTO THE DRESSING 
ROOM TO ASK HIM AND HE HAS IT IS 
ONLY A COUPLE OF INCHES BUT I 
THOUGHT THAT IS WHAT HE HAD DONE 
THIS IS THE WAY HE HAS BEEN 
PRACTISING 
HE NORMALLY WOULD GRIP THE CUE 
FURTHER BACK TOWARDS THE END OF IT 
HE MAY HAVE TO GO BACK BECAUSE HE 
IS STRETCHING THIS TIME 
HIS HIGHEST BREAK SO FAR HAS BEEN A 
BREAK OF THIRTY TWO IT IS LOOKING GOOD 
THE FRAME HAD IT BEFORE THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL HAS GIVEN HIM A 
BIT OF CONFIDENCE FOR FRAME HE 
TOOK 
IT IS AMAZING IF YOU LOOK AT 
STEVE'S CENTURY BREAKS THIS SEASON 
HE HAS ONLY MADE A ONE LAST SEASON 
HE ONLY MADE THREE HE HAS MADE THREE HUNDRED TWELVE 
IN HIS CAREER BUT THEY HAVE TRIED 
IT SOMEWHAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF 
SEASONS THEY HAVE DRIED UP JUST THIS RED AND ANY COLOUR IT WILL HAVE TO THE BLUE OR PINK 
AND THIS IS A BIT MORE LIKE IT 
GIVES YOU A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IF 
YOU CAN KILL THE FRAME OFF WITH ONE 
CHANCE 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE SCOREBOARD 
JUST ROLL THE BLUE IN STEVE DON'T 
WORRY ABOUT THE HEROICS 
HE IS STILL LOOKING AT THE 
SCOREBOARD STUART NEEDS TWO FOUR 
POINT SNOOKERS AT THE MOMENT HE IS JUST DEBATING WHETHER TO 
AND POT THE RED OFF THE CUSHION 
THERE 
SO BARRING A COUPLE OF SNOOKERS 
THAT BREAK OF FIFTY SEVEN SHOULD HAVE GIVEN 
STEVE DAVIS HAS SECOND FRAME HE IS 
ONLY ONE BEHIND NOW 
HE IS BACK IN 
THE MATCH LET'S HEAR STUART'S 
REFLECTIONS OF HIS CRISTOBAL KOREA 
CRISTOBAL CAREER 
MY MUM AND DAD GOT ME A STICKER 
BOOK WHEN I WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN IT HAD A 
PICTURE OF THE CRUCIBLE WITH FOUR 
PLAYERS I LOOKED AT THE CAMERA AND 
SAID WE ARE PLAYING THAT ONE BACK 
INTO ONE THOUSAND I MADE BY DEBUT L. 
COULDN'T WISH FOR BETTER OPPONENT 
THAN STEPHEN HENDRY THE DREAM DID 
COME TRUE AND I DID HAPPEN TO BEAT 
HIM SO IT WAS A GOOD START 
A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER I COME 
BACK AND PLAYS KEN DOHERTY 
AGAIN I HAD TO PLAY ANOTHER WORLD 
CHAMPION ANOTHER SPECIAL MOMENT 
IN THAT MATCH I MISSED THE PINK ON 
A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THAT HAS BEEN HAUNTING ME 
FOR A DOG PAST SIX YEARS FOR THE 
PAST SIX YEARS IT IS HARD FOR ANY 
SNOOKER PLAYER TO COME TO THE 
CRUCIBLE L. KNOW HOW LUCKY I AM 
JUST TO BE HERE TO PLAY WE ARE 
DOWN TO THE LAST THIRTY TWO OF THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS ANYTHING COULD 
HAPPEN 
HE IS DOING O. K. SO FAR THIS TIME 
ROUND WE REJOIN IT IN FRAME SEVEN 
HE IS TWENTY SEVEN POINTS UP 
A TERRIFIC POT THERE 
IS NO RHYME OR REASON TO THIS GAME 
SOMETIMES 
THERE YOU GO HE POTS A RED LIGHT 
THAT AND THEN THIS IS A BLACK 
THEN THIS IS A BLACK IT IS GETTING 
A BIT SCRAPPY WHICH WILL SUIT 
STEVE IN ALL HONESTY 
IF THEY BECOME LONG DRAWN OUT 
FRAMES THEN STEVE HAS GOT THE 
EXPERIENCE TO COPE WITH THAT 
HE WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO PLAY A 
CANNON BUT HE HAS GONE A BIT TOO 
FAR FOR THE BLUE 
I DON'T THINK HE HAS TO CANNON THE 
LITTLE TRIANGLE OF REDS 
I THINK HE'S O. K. HE CAN DROP THIS 
IN THE MIDDLE POCKET AND FINISH 
NICELY ON THE PINK HE HAS GOT TO 
KEEP IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE FOR 
HIMSELF 
THAT IS O. K. THERE IS A PATH TO GET 
ON THE RIGHT OF THE THREE REDS AND 
IF HE GETS ON THAT HE WILL FREE 
THE OTHER TWO THEY WILL BOTH 
BECOME AVAILABLE 
HE UNDERHIT IT AGAIN 
YOU CANNOT 
THINK OF MANY SHOTS HE HAS OVERHIT 
BUT HE IS O. K. IF HE HAS ENOUGH 
ANGLE TO RUN THROUGH FOR THE BLUE THAT IS INCH PERFECT 
THESE THREE REDS ARE FAIRLY 
COMFORTABLE AND THE OTHERS ARE NOT 
ALL THAT BAD 
THIS WOULD BE A BIG CONFIDENCE 
BOOST ARE IF HE COULD TAKE THIS 
FRAME STUART BINGHAM WAS A 
FAVOURITE THAT WAS A GOOD POSITIONAL SHOT 
I USED TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU WERE 
PLAYING AND YOU WOULD GET ONE 
PERSON CLAPPING YOU WOULD THINK 
NICE TO GET ONE SUPPORTER HERE 
THIS IS A FRAME THAT MAY HEARD 
STUART BINGHAM HE LOOKED CERTAIN 
TO WIN IT HE HAD A COUPLE OF GOOD 
CHANCES DIDN'T MAKE THE MOST OF 
THEM 
HE WILL PLAY FOR THE RED THAT IS UP 
NEAR THE GREEN THIS TIME ANYTHING 
BUT STRAIGHT IF HE IS STRAIGHT 
THEN IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A 
PROBLEM HE WILL NOT WANT TO PLAY 
FOR THE GREEN LET'S PUT IT THAT 
WAY 
JUST A DELICATE LITTLE ONES ALONG 
THE CUSHION LOOKS GOOD TO ME 
HE IS GOING TO NEED THE YELLOW TO 
SECURE THE FRAME IF HE POTS THE 
BLUE STUART WILL STILL BE ABLE TO 
TIE 
AND SHE DOES NOT WANT TO LEAVE A 
LONGISH YELLOW HE'S JUST THINKING 
ABOUT TRYING TO GET AS CLOSE TO THE 
YELLOW AS POSSIBLE NOT RIGHT ON 
TOP OF THE YELLOW BUT UP THAT END 
OF THE TABLE RATHER THAN LEAVING LONGISH POT 
IT IS A LONGISH ONE LET'S SEE IF 
THE CONFIDENCE HAS RESTORED AND HE 
CAN KNOCK THIS ONE IN TO GET BACK 
TO JUST ONE FRAME BEHIND 
TERRIFIC AMOUNT OF SUPPORT FOR 
STEVE DAVIS HERE WHEN HE WAS 
INTRODUCED AT THE START OF THIS 
MATCH HE HAD TERRIFIC RECEPTION 
WELL IT LOOKS AS IF STEVE DAVIS 
HAS DONE ENOUGH 
LET'S SEE IF STEVE CAN KEEP THE 
COMEBACK GOING IN FRAME EIGHT 
WELL THAT IS A TERRIFIC OPENING 
RED HE HAS JUST ABOUT CREPT PAST 
THE BAULK LINE TO BE ON THE BROWN 
HE HAS GOT A PERFECT ANGLE ON THE 
BROWN HERE IF HE CAN STUN IN AND 
MISS THE MIDDLE POCKET 
HE'S FINE I THINK THERE IS A 
COUPLE BUT GO 
A COUPLE THAT GO THAT WAS A 
FANTASTIC RED AND WHAT A CHANCE HE 
HAS GIVEN HIMSELF HE NEEDS TO GET 
HIMSELF GOING HERE HE HAS LOST HIS 
WAIT A LITTLE BIT HE HASN'T QUITE 
SETTLED INTO THE USUAL RHYTHM THAT 
YOU SEE FROM THIS VERY GOOD BREAK 
BUILDER AND POTTER 
JUST HAVING A THINK ABOUT THIS A 
LITTLE BIT HE IS JUST WONDERING 
WHICH COLOUR TO PLAY AND WHETHER 
HE CAN A JUDGE THE CANNON OFF THE 
SECOND RED TO GUARANTEE A GOOD 
POSITION ON THE BLACK OR TRY AND 
GO FOR A BLUE OR BALL BAULK 
COLOUR 
HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING 
BETTER THAN THAT THAT IS A POOR 
SHOT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER 
PLAYING WITH TOP SPIN HERE AT 
LEAST OF THE CUE BALL WOULD HAVE 
RUN TO THE SIDE CUSHION HE 
MISJUDGED THAT BADLY END OF BREAK 
THE KISS ON THE YELLOW HAS LEFT 
STEVE A CHOICE OF A COUPLE OF POTS 
CLUB BACK INTO THE LEFT CORNER 
STRAIGHT ON TO THE RIGHT ONE 
IT IS THE CUTBACK HE HAS ELECTED TO 
TAKE 
IT'S JUST TO SHOW YOU WHAT HE IS 
LOOKING AT 
HE GOT ENOUGH SCREW ON IT HE HAD A 
BIT OF SAFETY IN MIND THERE AS WELL 
FIRST PLAYER TO PLAY THAT TYPE OF 
SAFETY WHEN YOU GET THE SCREW BACK 
INTO BAULK WAS A CANADIAN 
STEVE THOUGHT HE COULD PLAY THAT IN 
SUCH A WAY THAT IF HE MISSED IT 
THE RED WOULD COME AWAY FROM THE 
POCKET BUT IT HASN'T DONE 
NOT THE BEST OF KISSES HE'S OKAY 
HE HAS GOT A CHANCE OF THE BLUE 
BUT HE WILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF 
WORK TO DO WITH THE CUE BALL TO GET 
THE WHITE IN AND OUT OF BAULK 
JUST CAUGHT THE BUMP OF THE MIDDLE 
POCKET BUT IT HAS NOT WORKED OUT 
TOO BADLY HE HAS ENDED UP O. K. 
THIS LOOKS INCH PERFECT THE RED TO 
THE RIGHT CORNER IS THE ONE THAT HE 
WANTS TO BE ON TO PLAY FOR THE 
BLACK HE IS ON IT BUT HE IS 
LOOKING FOR THE EASIER RED INTO 
THE RIGHT MIDDLE WHEN SURELY THE 
ONE TO THE RIGHT CORNER THEN DROP 
ON THE BLACK 
IT WAS HELD BY THE FACT THAT THE 
PINK WOULD GO TO THE RIGHT CORNER 
WHICH WE COULDN'T SEE FROM OUR 
POSITION AND THESE TWO REDS TO THE 
RIGHT HAND SIDE I'M SURE THE 
BOTTOM ONE WILL GO TO THE LEFT 
CORNER SO STILL IN PRIME POSITION 
HERE 
THE PINK SPOT IS NOT AVAILABLE 
HIGHEST AVAILABLE IS THE YELLOW 
SPOT 
IF YOU DO NOT GET THE RIGHT ANGLE 
ON THE BLUE IT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS 
HE HAS OVER SCREWED THAT SLIGHTLY 
I THINK HE IS STILL ON THIS RED HE 
DOES NOT LOOK TOO HAPPY BUT SURELY 
THIS RED WILL IT STILL POT HE 
HAD A CHANCE EARLY ON TO STAY 
AROUND THE BLACK SPOT AREA THEN HE 
PLAYED THE PINK HE IS SLOWLY 
RUNNING AWAY FROM IT 
THAT WAS A GOOD POT BUT I'M NOT 
SAYING HE HAS RECOVERED THE 
SITUATION JUST YET HE'S NOT INTO 
PERFECT INCH PERFECT THIS LOOKS INCH PERFECT TO ME 
SO HE IS LOOKING GOOD AGAIN THAT 
PINK WAS PLAYED TO PERFECTION I'M 
JUST THINKING BACK TO THE LAST TIME 
HE WAS HERE TALKING ABOUT THE PINK 
HE HAD A CHANCE OF A MAXIMUM 
BREAK IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND MISSED THE PINK 
HE DOESN'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT IT 
EVEN NOW 
SO THE COLOUR AND ONE MORE RED 
THIS IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED 
THE RED IS THERE NOW TOOK A LITTLE 
BIT OF A CHANCE PLAYING THE CANNON 
BUT IT HAS WORKED OUT INCH PERFECT 
I DO BELIEVE THE FACT THAT STEVE 
DAVIS DID THE LAST FRAME IT SEEMS 
TO HAVE FIRED STEVE STUART 
BINGHAM UP THIS IS THE BEST HE HAS 
LOOKED SO FAR HE KNEW THAT STEVE 
WAS LOOKING BIT DANGEROUS AND THIS IS HOW HE HAS RESPONDED 
THIS WILL BE HIS HIGHEST BREAK OF 
THE MATCH JUST TRYING TO DISTURB THAT RED 
THE CENTURY BREAK MAY HAVE BEEN ON 
IF HE HAD PULLED IT AWAY FROM THE 
CUSHION STEVE DAVIS WILL NOT 
RETURN TO THE TABLE 
STUART WON THE NEXT FRAME THE 
FINAL FRONT OF THE SESSION HE 
LEADS SIX TO THREE THE FINAL FRAME OF THE 
SESSION WILLIE THORNE HAS JOINED 
US HERE CAN YOU SEE STEVE FIGHTING 
BACK 
I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE BACK WAY HE STARTED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
A BIT OF A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM TO 
SEE HOW POORLY HE PLAYED IN THE 
FIRST THREE THE FACT THAT HE HAS 
SHARED THE LAST SIX BUT SIX TO THREE BEHIND 
I THINK IT WILL BE TOO TOUGH YOU YOU CANNOT LEGISLATE FOR WHAT HAPPENS 
IN THE CRUCIBLE BECAUSE HE HAS 
BEEN PRACTISING SO HARD 
THE FIRST 
THREE FRAMES HE HAS NOT MANAGED TO 
MAKE TWENTY A LOT OF PLAYERS WOULD 
HAVE LOST THAT SESSION EIGHT TO ONE BUT 
STEVE MANAGED TO GET THE BEST HE 
COULD OUT OF THAT SESSION JOHN JOHN WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I HAVE A COUPLE 
OF INTERESTED SPECTATORS WHAT DID 
YOU THINK 
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I 
THOUGHT HE WAS A BIT CAGEY AT THE 
START BUT PLENTY OF FRAMES TO GO 
SO HE HAS A BIG CHANCE 
DO YOU KNOW 
MUCH ABOUT THE GOLDEN YEARS OF 
STEVE DAVIS 
A I HAVE GOT A D. V. D. 
WHERE HE LOST TO DENNIS TAYLOR 
STUFF LIKE THAT 
WHEN HE THUMPED ME 
IN THE FINAL 
I WATCHED THAT OVER 
AND OVER AGAIN 
YOU HAVE BEEN IN 
AND WATCHED WOULD YOU MAKE OF IT 
IT STARTED OFF A BIT EDGY FROM BOTH 
PLAYERS BUT STEVE OBVIOUSLY 
GREAT AMBASSADOR FOR THE GAME 
TRIES TO WIN 
I'VE PLAYED IN ONE OF 
HIS EIGHTEEN 
WHEN I HAD HAIR STILL AN 
OPEN GAME 
DID YOU BEATING 
AT NO 
I LET HIM WIN IF HE CAN SCORE A 
LOT HEAVIER AND MAKE LESS MISTAKES 
WITH HIS SAFETY HE CAN WIN THAT THAT IS ALL HE HAS TO DO LESS MISTAKES 
AND POT EVERY BALL 
WE CAN TALK 
ABOUT STEVE LONG AND HARD HOW HE 
HAS PERFORMED BUT WHAT ABOUT 
STUART BINGHAM HE IS A TALENTED 
PLAYER HE IS NOT GOING TO MISS AN 
OPPORTUNITY 
I HAVE BEEN A BIG FAN OPPORTUNITY OF HIS I KNOW HIM FOR WHEN HE WAS 
FIRST COMING IN TO THE GAME THERE 
IS SOMETHING MISSING BECAUSE EVERY 
SO OFTEN HE IS A VERY GOOD BREAK 
BUILDER NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE GETS 
TOO CLOSE MATCHES HE FAILS TO GO 
OVER THE LINE HE IS A PLAYER LIKE 
JAMIE COPE YOU DO NOT REALLY WANT 
TO PLAY HIM IN THE FIRST ROUND THE THE QUESTION WAS RAISED THIS MORNING 
ABOUT THE END OF AN ERA POSSIBLY 
FOR STEPHEN HENDRY AND FOR STEVE 
DAVIS AS AN ELITE SNOOKER PLAYER 
HOW DID YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS TIME 
TO STOP 
I REMEMBER A FEW YEARS AGO 
WHEN MARK WILLIAMS AND STEPHEN 
HENDRY WERE COMING IN IT IS THE 
NEW GOT ME THROUGH BUT IT HAPPENS 
IT IS LIFE WE LOOK AT STEPHEN LEE 
MARK WILLIAMS STRUGGLING A BIT 
PETER EBDON NOT AT HIS BEST I 
THINK IT IS ALMOST TIME FOR A NEW 
GUIDE AGAIN 
DO YOU THINK THE 
STRENGTH IN DEPTH PICTURES THAT 
THROUGH QUICKER THAN IT WOULD HAVE 
DONE IN YEARS GONE BY 
PERHAPS BUT 
WHEN YOU ARE AT AN AGE HE COULD WIN 
ANY MORE IT IS TOUGH 
IT IS DAY 
THREE OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS A 
YOUNG MAN FROM NORTHERN IRELAND 
COULD MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF HE 
LEADS STEPHEN HENDRY SIX TO THREE IT IS 
MARK ALLEN 
I SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE USED 
TO VENUE THAN I WAS LOST HERE L. 
THINK ALL THE PLAYERS WILL BE 
NERVOUS WALKING OUT IT IS 
SOMETHING YOU DREAM OF PLAYING 
SOMEONE LIKE STEPHEN IN AN ARENA 
LIKE THE CRUCIBLE 
UP UNTIL THEN I HADN'T DONE MUCH 
AGAINST THE TOP PLAYERS WAS JUST 
WINNING MATCHES TO KEEP MY RANKING 
POSITION I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING 
SPECIAL THAT GAVE ME THE 
CONFIDENCE TO GO ON AND DO WHAT I 
DID THIS YEAR I'VE BEEN IN THE TOP 
SIXTEEN OVER THE SEASON I'VE WORKED MY 
WAY UP THE RANKINGS THE MAIN AIM 
IS TO WIN TOURNAMENTS WHICH I 
HAVEN'T DONE BUT YOU HAVE TO BE 
REALISTIC I'M STILL QUITE YOUNG SO 
HOPEFULLY I'LL HAVE NUMBER OF 
YEARS LEFT IF I CAN SECURE MY TOP 
SIXTEEN PLACE THEN MAYBE NEXT YEAR I CAN 
RELAX BIT MORE AND START 
COMPETING IN THE TOURNAMENTS L. 
THINK WITH MY GIRL FRIEND BEING 
SNOOKER ORIENTATED HERSELF SHE 
KNOWS WHAT'S INVOLVED AND THE UPS 
AND DOWNS OF WINNING L. LIKE HAVING 
SOMEONE THAT I KNOW PRETTY WELL 
WITH ME AT A TOURNAMENT DON'T 
REALLY LIKE BEING ON MY OWN IT 
GETS VERY LONELY PLACE I'VE 
BEEN TRAVELLING AROUND THE WORLD 
SINCE I WAS FOURTEEN L. HAVEN'T SEEN AS 
MUCH OF MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS AS IT 
WOULD HAVE LIKED OVER THE TIME ANY 
CHANCE TO GET TO HAVE A FAMILY 
MEMBER OR SOMEONE WHO IS CLOSE TO 
YOU IS BONUS THERE'S GOING TO BE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE SUPPORTING ME I'VE 
HAD TO BOOK A LOT OF TICKETS FOR 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO WERE 
TRAVELLING FROM NORTHERN IRELAND 
I'VE GOT MORE FRIENDS TRAVELLING 
DOWN FROM THE MIDLANDS WHICH IS 
WHERE I'M BASED WHEN I'M IN ENGLAND 
THEY SHOULD BE QUITE GOOD SUPPORT 
THEIR FOR ME AND IT SHOULD HELP 
RELAX ME WHEN YOU LOOK AT STEVENS 
RECORD AND THE TOURNAMENTS HE HAS 
WON OVER THE YEARS I DON'T THINK 
HAS RESULTS OVER THE LAST THREE 
YEARS MAYBE HAVEN'T BEEN WHAT HE 
EXPECTS THEM TO BEAT BUT HE IS 
STILL MORE THAN CAPABLE OF BEATING 
ANY PLAYER AT ANY TOURNAMENT L. 
KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH FOR ME 
BUT I'VE BEEN IN THE U. K. 
CHAMPIONSHIPS IN NOVEMBER DECEMBER 
TIME AND THAT DEFINITELY GAVE ME 
THE CONFIDENCE IT WILL STILL BE A 
TOUGH MATCH 
ONCE STEPHEN AND MARK HAVE 
DISPENSED WITH THE PLEASANTRIES 
BATTLE COMMENCED WITH THE SEVEN 
TIMES CRUCIBLE CHAMPION WINNING THE 
FIRST FRAME ALTHOUGH BOTH PLAYERS 
BETRAYED FEW SIGNS OF NERVES 
BUT THE YOUNG MAN FROM ANTRIM HAS 
SHOWN HE IS NOT WANT TO BE OVERAWED 
BY THE BIG OCCASION THIS 
AGGRESSIVE SHOT SET UP A BREAK OF 
SEVENTY 
IN THE NEXT FRAME HE TOPPED UP WITH 
A BREAK OF EIGHTY SEVEN THAT INCLUDED THE 
SUPERB POSITIONAL SHOT HE LED TWO TO ONE THE LEAD IN INCREASED TO THREE TO ONE 
STEPHEN WASN'T GETTING A LOT OF 
TABLE TIME WHEN HE HAD HIS CHANCES 
HE COULDN'T CONVERT THEM ONCE 
AGAIN MARK CLEAR UP 
BUT THE GAME'S GREATEST EVER 
CENTURION RECORDED KOREA SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN TO 
REDUCE HIS ARREARS TO FOUR TO TWO 
BUT IN FRAME SEVEN MARK SHOWED HE 
WAS STILL IN THE PINK AS HE 
NOTCHED UP CAREER CENTURY NUMBER FORTY TWO 
FRAME EIGHT NEARLY PRODUCED A THIRD 
CONSECUTIVE CENTURY AND STEPHEN 
MADE A BREAK OF NINETY THREE 
BUT THE FINAL FRAME OF THE SESSION 
WHEN THE WAY OF THE YOUNGSTER HE 
LEADS SIX TO THREE BUT STEPHEN HENDRY AS AN 
OUT OF IT YET ISN'T OUT OF IT

THE STEPHEN HENDRY MARK ALLEN GAME 
IT COULD BE QUITE AN AFTERNOON FOR 
THE YOUNGSTER FROM NORTHERN IRELAND 
IN THE COMMENTARY BOX IT'S TERRY 
GRIFFITHS AND CLIVE EVERTON 
THE THIRTYSOMETHINGS VERSUS THE 
TWENTYSOMETHINGS IS A MAJOR THEME 
OF THIS CHAMPIONSHIP LAST EVENING 
THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD PETER EBDON JUST HELD 
OFF TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD JAMIE COPE TEN TO NINE 
NOW TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD MARK ALLEN IS GOING 
TO TRY TO TURN OVER THIRTY NINE YEAR OLD 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
RESUMING THREE FRAMES IN ARREARS 
IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR HENDRY 
TO MAKE A GOOD START 
IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT 
HENDRY'S SUCCESS RATE THAT TYPE OF 
POT IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT WAS A FEW 
YEARS AGO 
IN FACT HE'S POTTED ONLY THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF HIS LONG POTS THIS IS MORE LIKE IT 
MARK ALAN'S LONG POT FAILED BUT IT 
WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT ANYTHING 
HE'S LEFT HIMSELF A SLIGHT ANGLE ON 
THIS RED IT'S STILL TRICKY 
THE EASIER YOU CAN HIT THESE BE 
MORE CHANCE THE POCKET HAS OF 
ACCEPTING THE BALL 
AS USUAL WITH THAT TYPE OF SHOT 
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO POSITION 
YOURSELF AND LEAVE YOURSELF A THIN 
CUT IF YOU GET TOO STRAIGHT LIKE 
HE WAS THEN YOU'VE GOT TO WICKET A 
LONG THESE BOTTOM CUSHIONS 
I THINK THOSE SHOTS ALONG THAT TOP 
RAIL ARE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT 
THAN THEY SOMETIMES OUR R. 
THE POCKET SO ALWAYS CUT TO THE 
SAME TEMPLATES BUT YOU STILL GET 
SMALL VARIATIONS THESE ARE ON THE 
TOP SIDE TOUGH SIDE 
HAWKEYE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE HAPPY 
WITH THAT 
MARK ALLEN HAS ALREADY PUSHED HIS 
WAY INTO THE TOP SIXTEEN ON THE 
PROVISIONAL LIST IF HE SHOULD GO 
ON TO WIN THIS LAST I THINK IT WILL 
CEMENT HIS PLACE JUST THREE 
SEASONS TO GET INTO THE TOP SIXTEEN IS A 
REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT VERY FEISTY CONFIDENT AND TALENTED 
I THINK IT'S A POINT ALSO THAT MARK 
ALLEN TURNED PROFESSIONAL AT ABOUT 
THE RIGHT AGE IF YOU TURN THESE 
DAYS WHEN YOU'RE SIXTEEN IT IS VERY 
DIFFICULT TO MAKE ANY INROADS IN AT 
THAT AGE NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU 
ARE 
YES BY WAITING A BIT LONGER HE 
ACCUMULATED A VERY FINE AMATEUR 
RECORD NORTHERN IRELAND AMATEUR 
CHAMPION EUROPEAN AMATEUR CHAMPION 
WORLD AMATEUR CHAMPION THOSE 
TITLES GIVE YOU A TASTE FOR WINNING 
THEY ARE GREAT PREPARATION FOR THE 
PROFESSIONAL GAME YOU CAN'T 
PRACTISE ALL YOU LIKE BUT YOU ONLY 
REALLY LEARN BY PLAYING IMPORTANT 
MATCHES 
MARK ALLEN WAS VERY STRONG IN THIS 
DEPARTMENT IN THE FIRST SESSION HE 
TENDED TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE 
CHANCES THAT CAME HIS WAY 
YES HE MADE A CENTURY AND FIVE 
MORE BREAKS BETWEEN FORTY NINE AND NINETY ONE POT SUCCESS RATE NINETY PER CENT 
I CAN HEAR A NOISE OUT IN THE 
IRANIAN ARENA AT THE CRUCIBLE 
YOU ARE SO CLOSE TO THE AUDIENCE 
SOMEBODY COULD NOT OFFER OUT THERE 
AND START SNORING 
THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SEND THEM TO 
SEE BUT THESE TWO PLAYERS SEND 
THEM TO SLEEP WITH THESE TWO 
PLAYERS 
A FEW MINUTES AGO PLAYERS MICHAELA TABB ASKED ONE MEMBER OF 
THE AUDIENCE TO TURN DOWN HIS 
HEADSET COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED 
STEPHEN HENDRY WILL BE VERY AWARE 
HOW IMPORTANT THIS VISIT IS 
HE DIDN'T HAVE THE BEST OF CONTACTS 
THERE TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF RUN OUT 
OF THE CUE BALL ONLY FOUR OR FIVE 
INCHES BUT IT MAKES SUCH 
DIFFERENCE TO THE ANGLE OF THE RED 
HE'S TAKEN ON HERE 
THE POT WAS SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT 
THAN HE EXPECTED ON THE RED 
ALLEN PASSED HIS FAILURE AT THAT 
BLACK FROM POINT BLANK RANGE WASN'T 
VERY COSTLY 
HE WILL STILL BE THINKING ABOUT IT 
IF HE LOSES THE FRAME THOUGH NICELY STRUCK IN FROM DISTANCE 
HE NEEDED TO GET REALLY TIGHT ON 
THAT GREEN BECAUSE IF HE ACHIEVE 
THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY 
DIFFICULT SNOOKER FOR MARK TO HIT 
AN ESCAPE FROM 
YOU CAN SEE AT LEAST ONE RED THE 
ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TABLE 
I DON'T THINK HE CAN GET PAST THE 
BLUE FOR THE OTHER TWO THE TRACES 
ARE TO TAKE ON A DIFFICULT POT TEN PLAY SAFETY SHOT 
THE NATURAL ANGLE PLAYED WITHOUT 
SPIN WAS TAKING THE CUE BALL INTO 
ANOTHER RED 
HE STILL WENT FOR IT BUT WITH 
BACKSPIN 
HE FLICKED OFF THE SECOND RED AND 
COME BACK TOWARDS THE BAULK COLOURS 
HE WASN'T ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SURE HE WAS GOING 
TO POT IT HE STRUCK IT PERFECTLY 
HE WAS VERY UNFORTUNATE WHERE THE 
BALL HAS STOPPED 
HE NEEDS TO PULL THE CURTAINS HERE 
I THINK PLAY SAFETY HERE 
AM SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE 
AUDIENCE WILL BE WATCHING HERE AT 
THE CRUCIBLE AND THINKING WELL 
IT'S SIX TO THREE HE IS A LONG WAY IN FRONT 
THIS YOUNG LAD BUT IT'S THESE 
EARLY FRAMES THAT A HUGE THEY CAN 
SET THE PATTERN FOR THE REST OF THE 
SESSION THEY CAN GIVE CONFIDENCE 
TO ONE PLAY AND TRAIN THE 
CONFIDENCE FROM ANOTHER 
THAT WAS A POOR SAFETY SHOT IT 
LOOKS AS IF THE YELLOW IS COVERING 
IT OR IS IT CAN HE GET THROUGH 
THERE HE CAN 
HOW CARELESS WAS THAT 
THAT FRINGES 
ON THE WORST POSITIONAL SHOT I'VE 
EVER SEEN AND I PLAYED AGAINST 
YOU ONCE CLIVE 
WOULD BE HE CAUGHT IT A BIT THINNER 
THAN HE INTENDED THAT'S THE ONLY 
WAY I CAN DEFEND THAT SHOT THAT'S 
A STRAIGHT FORWARD FRAME WINNING 
OPPORTUNITY GONE BY 
A FEW MISTAKES IN THIS OPENING 
FRAME OF THE SESSION WHICH WILL 
DETERMINE WHETHER MARK ALLEN 
INCREASES HIS LEAD TO FOUR FRAMES 
OR STEPHEN REDUCES IT TO TO MACRO 
IT'S THE RED AND THE PINK ON THE 
RIGHT HAND SIDE HE HAS GOT TO AVOID 
IF HE CAN'T SEE THE BLACK HE HAS 
BEEN UNFORTUNATE 
THAT RED THAT STEPHEN POT IT THERE 
IF HE HAD CAUGHT IT SLIGHTLY THICK 
OR THIN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
CANNONING THOSE BALLS AND WOULD BE 
LEAVING MARK ALLEN ANOTHER CHANCE TWO CUSHIONS HERE FOR THIS RED 
I THINK IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A 
GLANCING ESCAPE 
EVEN IF THE RED HAD NOT CAUGHT THE 
KNUCKLE ON THE WAY BACK DOWN I 
THINK MARK ALLEN WOULD HAVE BEEN 
SNOOKERED ON BOTH REDS HE'S MADE A GOOD JOB OF IT 
MARK ALLEN'S THIRD ATTEMPT TO GET 
IT SAFE NOT A GOOD SAFETY FROM HENDRY 
HE WAS TRYING TO GET BEHIND THE 
PINK BUT THE PRIORITY IS ALWAYS TO 
GET THE RED SAFE IF YOU CAN GET SNOOKER AS WELL THAT'S FINE 
HERE IS ALLEN'S CHANCE TO INCREASE 
HIS LEAD 
HE DIDN'T GET THROUGH THAT VERY 
WELL HE IS TWO OR THREE INCHES 
SHORT TO BE PERFECT ON THIS RED 
STEPHEN HAS THINKING IS THAT 
SAFETY GOING TO COST ME THAT FIRST 
FRAME 
THE BROWN DOES GO THAT LEAVES AND 
THE YELLOW IN THE CENTRE GREEN IS EFFECTIVELY FRAME BALL 
IT LEAVES HENDRY LEAD BUT NEEDING 
TWO SNOOKERS 
A VERY GOOD SHOT IF HE HAS GOT THE 
CUE BALL UNDER THE EDGE OF THE 
BLACK HE HAS 
JUST AS WELL IT'S TWO SNOOKERS 
NEEDED THAT'S ONE OF THEM 
HE WILL POT THE BROWN AND TRIED TO 
LEAVE THE WHITE IN A GOOD POSITION 
TO PLAY ANOTHER SNOOKER IT'S 
DIFFICULT FOR STEPHEN HENDRY TO GET 
THE WHITE BEHIND THE BLACK HE IS 
RESTRICTED WITH THE ANGLES HE CAN 
GET TO ACHIEVE THAT SHOT BUT IF 
DOES GET BEHIND IT IT IS GOING TO 
BE TERRIBLY DIFFICULT TO HIT 
HE HAD TO GET THAT DEAD WEIGHT HE IS NOT GOING TO GET A SNOOKER BEHIND THE BLACK NOW 
IT WOULD BE VERY UNUSUAL IF HENDRY 
WERE TO WIN THIS FRAME AFTER 
NEEDING TO MACRO SNOOKERS HE HAS 
NEVER BEEN NOTED FOR WINNING FRAMES 
FROM THE ONE SNOOKER REQUIRED STAGE 
THIS FRAME IS THE LONGEST OF THE 
MATCH SO FAR RUNNING JUST OVER TWENTY ONE MINUTES 
A BIT MORE PACE ON THAT BLACK COULD 
HAVE BEEN NUDGED IN 
HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL IT'S ABOUT 
ALL HE COULD DO FROM THERE CLIVE 
YES JUST MADE SURE HE DIDN'T KNOCK 
THE BLACK IN AND HOPE THAT THE BLUE 
RAN SAFE 
STEPHEN HENDRY IS RESTRICTED WITH 
THE BLACK AS IT IS 
MARK ALLEN KEEPS TRYING TO ROLL THE 
BLUE AT THE POCKET NOT THIS TIME 
HE PLAYED IT WITH A BIT MORE PACE 
BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT STEPHEN CAN'T 
REALLY POT THE BLUE EVEN IF HE 
LEAVES IT ON THE WHOLE STEPHEN 
WILL TRY TO KEEP IT OUT BECAUSE OF 
THE WAY THE BALLS ARE PLACED 
HELLO OH THAT COULD BE GOOD IT 
IS HE WAS TAKING CHANCE 
IT WAS 
EXACTLY WHAT HE INTENDED THERE WAS 
A DANGER OF KNOCKING THE BLACK IN 
BUT HE KNEW THAT IF HE COULD GET 
THE BLUE REALLY CLOSE TO THE BLACK 
THAT THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY HE 
COULD MAKE MARK ALLEN KNOCKING IN 
IF YOU CAN SEE THE RIGHT SIDE 
CUSHION THERE HE SHOULD BE O. K. 
HE'S PLAYING IT DEAD WEIGHT 
IT HAS GONE WRONG THE BLUE IS 
STAYING NEAR THE BOTTOM POCKET AS 
WELL 
IF HENDRY CAN CLEAR UP HERE IT IS 
A MASSIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL SHIFT WHEN 
HE NEEDED TWO SNOOKER'S AND SHE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN ASSUMING HE WAS 
GOING TO LOSE THE FRAME HENDRY 
WOULD HAVE BEEN ASSUMING 
HE STRUCK THAT BEAUTIFULLY BUT HE 
IS A COUPLE OF INCHES SHORTER HAVE 
BEEN PERFECT 
HENDRY WINS THE FRAME FROM LEADING 
TWO SNOOKER'S LOOKED AS IF ALLEN 
WAS GOING TO GO SEVEN TO THREE AHEAD BUT 
HENDRY HAS NOW REDUCED HIS ARREARS 
TO SIX TO FOUR 
I THINK WE SAW THAT STEPHEN HENDRY 
MEANS BUSINESS 
WHAT A FRAME TO 
WIN FOR THE WORLD HE IS OUT OF 
THAT FRAME HE PLAYED A GREAT SHOT 
HE TOOK A CHANCE ON IT WHEN HE 
PLAYED THE BLUE ADDED HAS GONE A 
CROSS THIS IS A VERY VERY RISKY 
HE WAS HOPING HE WOULD MAKE MARCO 
AND DO EXACTLY WHAT HE DID THAT 
COULD HAVE GONE IN 
THAT IS A 
LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY I DON'T 
THINK IN THE HISTORY OF HENDRY 
PLAYING HERE I DON'T THINK HE HAS 
EVER WON A FRAME FROM LEADING TWO 
SNOOKERS 
IT WAS A MUST FOR HIM TO SNOOKERS CARRY ON 
THAT COULD BE A BODY BLOW 
HOW CAN MARK ALLEN PUT THAT TO THE 
BACK OF HIS MIND 
WHAT EFFECT WILL 
THAT HAVE WON HIM YESTERDAY YESTERDAY STEPHEN HENDRY CAME BACK WITH A ONE HUNDRED 
BREAK AND I SAID IT WOULD AFFECT 
MARK ALLEN BUT HE CAME STRAIGHT 
BACK AND HAD A CENTURY 
DO YOU SEE 
THE WAY STEPHEN STAYED DOWN AFTER 
HE PUT THE BLACK IN IT WAS LIKE A 
PLAYER OF HOW HE MEANT BUSINESS 
MARK ALLEN SHOULD HAVE WON THE GAME 
EARLIER ON HE HAD RED OVER THE 
MIDDLE POCKET THAT WAS THE WORST 
SHOT OF THE GAME KNOCKING THE 
BLACK IN HE WILL BE HORRIFIED 
THIS COULD BE AN INTERESTING 
AFTERNOON 
IT IS BUBBLING UP NICELY AFTERNOON NOT VERY NICE FOR MARK BUT STEPHEN 
HE WENT BACK TO HIS CHAIR QUITE 
CALMLY BUT INSIDE HE IS THINKING 
WHAT A RESULT THAT WAS 
STEPHEN HENDRY ONLY TWO OF FRAMES 
BEHIND MARK ALLEN KNOWS FULL WELL 
THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOUR 
FRAMES IN FRONT 
BUT YOU ARE SET THE PSYCHOLOGICAL 
PROBLEMS TO OVERCOME AND MARK 
ALLEN HAS GOT TO PUT THE 
DISAPPOINTMENTS OUT OF HIS MIND 
NOT AN ENCOURAGING START TO THIS 
FRAME THOUGH MISJUDGING HIS FIRST 
SAFETY 
YOU SEE THE STANCE OF STEPHEN 
HENDRY THAT IS HADDIN IN SUCH GOOD 
STEAD OVER THE YEARS THAT HAS 
HAD HIM 
HE KNOWS HE HAS TO PUSH ON IN THIS 
FRAME 
IF HE WINS THIS AT ONE VISIT HE 
GIVES MARK ALLEN A LOT OF TIME IN 
HIS CHAIR TO THINK ABOUT IT 
HENDRY HAS BEEN CHRISTENED DOG 
TIMES IN THE LAST FEW SEASONS 
HAS BEEN THROUGH SOME DARK TIMES 
BUT HE HAS NEVER LOST HIS FAITH IN 
HIS OWN ABILITY HE HAS NEVER 
RELAXED HIS COMMITMENT TO PRACTICE 
AND MAYBE THIS IS WHERE HE CAN MAKE 
ALL THAT COMMITMENT COUNT 
IN THE EARLY SEASON I HAVE TO SAY 
HENDRY DID APPEAR TO BE IN FREEFALL 
BUT HE HAS PLAYED BETTER ALTHOUGH 
NOT TO HIS BEST STANDARDS JUST 
LIKE IT REACHED THE SEMI FINALS OF 
THE WELSH OPEN AND MAYBE IT WILL 
ALL COME GOOD AGAIN AND IT WILL BE 
A CASE OF AN OLD MASTER RESTORED AT 
THE CRUCIBLE 
HE IS NOT HAPPY WITH THAT ONE 
THE OPPORTUNITY OF 
GETTING A MAXIMUM BREAK 
HE IS NOT ONE TO TURN DOWN THE 
OPPORTUNITY EVEN IF IT MEANS 
TAKING A RISK NOW AND AGAIN TO 
SACRIFICE THE FRAME 
THAT IS TRUE 
HE HAS MADE EIGHTY ONE FOR SEVENS IN 
COMPETITION 
MICHAELA TABB IS THE REFEREE THIS 
AFTERNOON AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP SHE IS OFF TO LAS 
VEGAS TO REFEREE IN THE WORLD PAUL 
MASTERS 
HE HAS TAKEN THESE VERY WELL HE HAS LEFT THE CHANCE WITH A POOR SAFETY SHOT FROM MARK ALLEN 
AND AS FREQUENTLY HAPPENS 
AND 
THIS FREQUENTLY HAPPENED A PLAYER 
STEALS A FRAME THAT HE HAD NO 
BUSINESS TO WIN HE GETS A NEW 
SURGE 
MARK ALLEN HAVING LOST THAT FRAME 
FROM HENDRY NEEDING TWO SNOOKER'S 
MESSED UP HIS FIRST SAFETY 
AND NOW THIS PINK IS EFFECTIVELY 
FRAME BALL 
HENDRY'S SIXTY EIGHT BREAK FROM HIS FIRST 
CHANCE OF THE FRAME LEAVES MARK 
ALLEN ISING ONE SNOOKER NEEDING 
ONE SNOOKER 
AND EVEN IF HE CANNOT WIN THE FRAME 
HE NEEDS TO MAKE A BIT OF A STAND 
HERE ATTLEE TO TRY TO MAKE HENDRY 
STRUGGLE FOR IT 
IT IS NOT OFTEN YOU SEE A 
TURNAROUND WHEN A PLAYER LIKE MARK 
ALLEN WOULD WIN THIS FRAME WHEN HE 
NEEDS SNOOKER AFTER HIS OPPONENT GOT ONE IN THE PREVIOUS FRAME 
VERY UNLIKELY BUT A POSSIBILITY 
THAT IS WELL PLAYED 
LIKE MANY LEFT HANDERS MARK ALLEN 
USE THE REST RIGHT HANDED 
HE HAS 
GOT A CHANCE HERE THE WAY THE RED 
IS BEHIND THE BLUE OF THE THERE 
THE BLUE UP THERE HE CAN JUST ROLL 
THAT RED PAST THE BLUE 
IT ALL SOUNDS EASY ENOUGH HE WILL 
HAVE A JOB NOW THAT WAS A POOR 
SHOT 
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT HIMSELF 
STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK 
HE HAS GOT 
THERE ANYWAY 
HIS PROBLEM THERE WAS THAT HE DID 
NOT WANT TO RUN THE REC RED INTO 
THE BLACK AND PUT THE BLACK SAFE 
SO HE HAS TRIED TO MISS THE BLACK 
WHICH HE ACHIEVED 
BUT BECAUSE OF THAT HE DIDN'T GET 
BEHIND THE BLUE BIG CHANCE GONE 
HE GIVES HENDRY THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
SNOOKER HIM 
WELL THAT IS A SNOOKER BUT IT 
LOOKS LIKE AN EASY HIT THIS COULD BE GOOD VERY GOOD 
AGAIN THOUGH ONE CUSHION ESCAPE 
SHOULDN'T TROUBLE STEPHEN HENDRY 
TOO MUCH 
WELL PLAYED SOME PEOPLE PREFER 
THAT TYPE OF SHOT YOU HAVE TO TAKE 
INTO THE EQUATION THAT IF HE MISSED 
THE RED HE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE FREE BALL 
IT IS NOT EASY FROM HERE TO GET THE 
SNOOKER 
THE BALL'S ARE LAYING QUITE WELL AT 
THE MOMENT FOR MARK ALLEN SO HE 
WILL KNOCK ON TO DISTURB THEM TOO 
MUCH HE WILL NOT WANT TO DISTURB 
THEM 
THAT WAS A CHANCE FOR HUNDRED BUT 
THE ISSUE BEYOND DOUBT FOR ENTRY 
TO PUT THE ISSUE 
HOW MANY TIMES 
HAVE WE SEEN THIS A PLAYER JUST 
NEEDS TO POT ONE BALL TO CLINCH THE 
FRAME AND HIS OPPONENT NEEDS TO 
SNOOKER AND THEY NEVER SEEM TO 
MANAGE IT 
OF COURSE HAD MARK ALLEN POTTED 
THAT PRODUCE SIMPLE BROWN IN THE 
FIRST FRAME OF THE SESSION HENDRY 
WOULD HAVE BEEN SO FOR OUT OF IT 
IT WOULD NOT HE WOULD NOT HAVE 
CONTINUED 
NOW THIS IS A MORE DIFFICULT ESCAPE 
DOWN THE PREVIOUS ONES THE ONLY 
THING AND STEPHEN HENDRY'S FAVOUR 
HERE HIS SHOULD HE MISS IT IT IS 
NOT OUT IN THE OPEN HE HAS GOT A 
BIT OF ROOM HERE HE HAS GOT TO 
WIDEN THE ANGLE OFF THE CUSHION 
HERE HE WILL HAVE TO PLAY THIS 
WITH A LOT OF RIGHT HAND SIDE 
IT LOOKED TIGHT TO ME GOOD 
ATTEMPTS THOUGH 
SO MARK ALLEN 
BACK IN IT HAVING OBTAINED THE 
PENALTY POINTS THAT HE NEEDED 
STILL NEEDS RED BLACK AND ALL THE 
COLOURS TO WIN 
AND THE WAY THAT ALLEN HAS PLAYED 
IN THE LATTER PART OF THIS FRAME 
HAS SHOWN THAT HE IS NOT JUST A 
POTTER 
EXCELLENT TRY THE OTHER THING IS 
WHAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ON MARK 
ALLEN NEEDED TO HANG ON HERE FOR A 
LITTLE WHILE JUST TO GET HIS HEAD 
BACK TOGETHER AFTER WHAT HAPPENED 
TO HIM IN THE PREVIOUS FRAME HE 
MAY POSSIBLY GET EVEN MORE OUT OF 
THIS WHO KNOWS HE IS STILL SECOND 
FAVOURITE TO WIN THIS FRAME 
THAT IS A VERY VERY POOR SAFETY 
SHOT HE'S LUCKY NOT TO LEAVE THIS 
RED ON 
DELIBERATELY PLAYED THAT HE COULD 
HAVE PLAYED IT MUCH THINNER AND 
GOT A BETTER SAFETY SHOT BUT HE IS 
PROTECTING HIS LEAD 
FROM THAT ANGLE ON THE BLACK 
THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE AN UNLIKELY 
ASK FRAME OVER 
HE HAD TO HIT IT SO HARD THAT THE 
BLACK LEFT THE BED OF THE TABLE 
HURDLED THE CORNER POCKET AND HE 
GAVE HENDRY BREATHING SPACE 
I THINK THE SHOT THAT HE ATTEMPTED 
WAS IMPOSSIBLE ACTUALLY 
I AGREE 
HE SHOULD HAVE POTTED THE BLACK AND 
PLAYED SAFELY ON THE YELLOW 
ANYWAY THE STORY OF THE AFTERNOON 
IS THAT STEPHEN HENDRY RESUMED A SIX 
THREE DOWN AND HAS WON THE FIRST TWO 
FRAMES 
I STILL PRACTISE A LOT I STILL 
BELIEVE IN MYSELF I STILL ENJOY 
GOING TO COMPETITIONS AND COMPETING 
WITH THE BEST PLAYERS L. KNOW MY IT 
A GAME IS BETTER GOOD ENOUGH TO 
BEAT ANYBODY I'M STILL TRYING TO 
WORK TO GET BACK TO WHERE I WAS 
THE MAIN DETERIORATION OF MY GAME 
HAS PROBABLY SINCE I LOST MY 
ORIGINAL CUE IN THE TWELVE YEARS 
BEFORE THAT I WON I DON'T KNOW HOW 
MANY IT IS NOT JUST DOWN TO THE 
CUE BUT IT WAS A MAJOR THING L. L. 
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PLAY THE SAME 
GAME THAT HAS BEEN VERY 
FRUSTRATING TO ME 
THEY ARE WATCHING THE LIKES OF 
HIGGINS O'SULLIVAN PLAYING AND I 
KNOW WHY CAN PLAY AT THAT LEVEL IF 
NOT HIGHER THAT IS WHAT KEEPS ME 
GOING IT IS FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU 
DO NOT DO IT 
ALLEN'S BREAK OFF AS IS OFTEN THE 
CASE HAS LEFT A RED TO RIGHT 
CORNER 
AND THE POSSIBILITY THEY HENDRY CAN 
GET TO THE RED BLACK AROUND THE 
BACK 
THE FIRST BALL THAT STEPHEN HENDRY 
HAS MISSED FOR A WHILE 
CLEVER SHOT IF HE MISSES IT HE 
WILL STILL BE ON EITHER PINK IN THE 
MIDDLE ON THE PINK 
WE HAVE SEEN HOW QUICKLY THESE 
THINGS CAN CHANGE 
IF MARK ALLEN WAS TO WIN A QUICK 
FRAME HERE HE WOULD BE BACK WHERE 
HE STARTED SOUNDS EASY ENOUGH TO ME ANYWAY 
THE TEST THAT ALL PLAYERS HAVE TO 
PASS AT CHAMPIONSHIP LEVEL IS HOW 
DO YOU REACT TO A SETBACK 
UNQUESTIONABLY IT WAS BIG 
SETBACK FOR HIM TO LOSE THE FIRST 
FRAME OF THE SESSION ESPECIALLY 
WITH HENDRY NEEDING TWO SNOOKERS 
BUT I THINK HE HAS GOT A PRETTY 
GOOD TEMPERAMENT 
YES HE IS NOT 
SHORT IN THAT DEPARTMENT BUT HE IS 
VERY COMFORTABLE IN THE BALLS 
WHICH IS SIMILAR TO WHAT STEPHEN 
HENDRY HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
MARK ALLEN IS NOT ONE FOR A LONG 
GRINDING FRAMES THOUGH HE CAN PLAY 
THEM HE'S ALWAYS AT HIS HAPPIEST 
IN A QUICK FIRE GAME EITHER YOU 
GET THEM OR I GET THEM 
HE IS ONLY 
THE AVERAGING SIXTEEN SECONDS A SHOT 
THAT DOES NOT INDICATE A LOT OF 
GRINDING FRAMES 
THERE HAS ONLY BEEN ONE OVER THE TWENTY 
MINUTES 
HE THOUGHT HE MISSED THAT ONE THEN 
HE HAD SLIGHT KICK 
WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS FRAME 
PERHAPS IN MARK ALLEN'S FRAME OF 
MIND THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING HE WILL NOT TURN DOWN THE 
CHANCE OF MAXIMUM 
HE IS NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE 
POSITIONALLY HERE JUST WONDERING 
HOW TO PLAY IT 
HE KNEW HE WOULD BE CANNONING THAT 
RED TOWARDS THE BLACK THAT HASN'T 
TURNED OUT TOO GOOD HE HAS FOULED 
IF HE LOSES THIS FRAME NOW IT IS 
TURNING INTO A HORROR STORY IN 
PLAY WITH FIFTY SEVEN AND HE FOULS A BALL 
WITH HIS HAND 
SO IF HENDRY STEALS THIS FRAME AS 
WELL AS HAVING STOLEN THE FIRST ONE 
BUT THERE WE GO HE HAS FAILED THAT 
RED WITH HIS SLEEVE 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS BROUGHT ANOTHER 
RED INTO PLAY 
MARK ALLEN WILL BE THINKING HAS 
ANOTHER FRAME BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM 
ME 
THE KICK CAME TO HIS RESCUE THAT THAT WAS JUST WHAT ALLEN NEEDED A 
STROKE OF CLOSE GROSSED WILL 
FORTUNE FOR HENDRY CHRIS BOWLES 
FORTUNE 
IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES FORTUNE DUE ALWAYS THINK HE'S GOING TO MAKE 
THE BALLS 
THE WAY HE HAS PLAYED THE LAST FEW 
FRAMES HE COULD HAVE GONE ON TO 
TAKE THAT 
WELL PERHAPS UNDERSTANDABLY ALLEN 
IS STARTING TO WOBBLE A BIT AFTER 
ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM 
HE HAS SLIGHTLY OF HAVE DONE THAT 
OVER DONE 
HE WAS ALMOST GOING TO PLAY THAT 
BLACK HE HAS NOW JUMPED UP AND 
SADLY FOUND OUT HE CAN SEE THE PINK 
HENDRY AT THE TABLE BECAUSE ALLEN 
FOULING THE BALL WITH HIS RIGHT 
ELBOW WITH HIS SLEEVE A VERY GOOD 
SPOT BY THE REFEREE MICHAELA TABB 
HE HAS GOT AN ANGLE JUST TO DROP ON 
THE RED WITH THE RIGHT CUSHION BUT 
HE CAN GET RIGHT BEHIND IT CAN'T 
THAT WAS PERFECT JUST LEAVE A 
SLIGHT ANGLE SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE 
HAS GOT TO POT THIS RED TO GET 
ANOTHER COLOUR 
IF HE WAS THINKING OF DISLODGING 
THE RED FROM THE PINK HE DIDN'T 
GET THE ANGLE HE WAS TRYING FOR HE WAS ON ANOTHER ANGLE 
NO OBVIOUS IMPEDIMENT NOW TO 
CLEARING THE REMAINING BALLS HE 
NEEDS TO LEVEL THE MATCH 
VERY WELL PLAYED THAT COULD HAVE 
GONE WRONG SCREWED ACROSS THE FACE 
OF THE BROWN FOR THE GREEN JUST BROWN AND BLUE NEEDED 
IT WAS UNEXPECTED BUT HE DID THE 
BUSINESS CLEARING OF SIXTY FOUR TO THE 
PINK TO LEVEL THE MATCH AT SIX TO SIX 
IT'S FANTASTIC GAME OF SNOOKER 
EVERY FRAME HAS BEEN MASSIVE OF 
COURSE WHAT STEPHEN HAS BEEN 
BRILLIANT AT ALL THROUGH HIS CAREER 
IS THAT IF HE SENSES THERE IS ANY 
WEAKNESS IN YOU AT ALL OR YOU HAVE 
MADE A MONUMENTAL MISTAKE A KNEECAP 
BLACK CAPITALISING ON HE IS YOUR 
MAN IT'S ONLY FOR THAT KICK BUT 
MARK ALLEN HIMSELF TOUCHING THE 
BALL WITH HIS SLEEVE BIG MISTAKE 
IT'S AMAZING REALLY BECAUSE IT IS 
QUITE CARELESS HE IS LEFT HANDED 
SO THERE WAS NO REAL NEED MICHAELA 
TABB HAS PROBABLY OUR BEST REFEREE 
AT THE MOMENT SHE NEVER MISSES A 
TRICK MARK ALLEN THERE WAS 
HORRIFIED YOU CAN SEE HIM THINKING 
THAT HENDRY HAS GOT CHANCE MARK MARK CALLED A FOUL ON HIMSELF YESTERDAY 
ALL THE SNOOKER PLAYERS DO L. GUESS 
NOW IT'S JUST THE WAY THE PENDULUM 
SWINGS THE START OFF BY SAYING 
STEPHEN HENDRY IS HIS EUROPA A A THING THIS IS A BIGGER FRAME NOW 
FOR MARK ALLEN AND IT IS FOR 
STEPHEN HENDRY HENDRY HAS DONE 
WHAT HE WANTED TO DO IT'S A BONUS 
IF STEPHEN HENDRY WINS THIS ONE 
MARK ALLEN HAS TO WIN THIS FRAME 
IT'S A MASSIVE CHARACTER TEST IT'S IT'S ABOUT TEMPERAMENT NOW 
VERY MUCH SO 
HERE WE GO FINAL FRAME BEFORE THEY 
GO OFF FOR AN INTERVAL 
AFTER LACKING INSPIRATION FOR MUCH 
OF THE SEASON STEPHEN HENDRY HAS 
FOUND IT ON HIS OWN OLD STAMPING 
GROUND WINNING THE FIRST THREE 
FRAMES OF THE AFTERNOON TWO FROM 
UNLIKELY POSITIONS 
MICHAELA TABB HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE 
FOR A COUPLE OF THE BEST EYESIGHT 
DECISIONS I'VE EVER SEEN A REFEREE 
MAKE 
AND THINKING OF WHEN SHE CALLED 
FALSE ON TOP AMERICAN POOL PLAYERS 
AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT THEY 
THOUGHT SHE WAS WRONG BUT SHE WAS 
AND THAT WASN'T 
YES THE POOL PLAYERS ARE NOT QUITE 
AS FAIR MINDED AS THE SNOOKER 
IT SAFE TO SAY 
THAT'S O. K. HE LEFT HIMSELF A NICE 
ANGLE HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO FULL 
BALL INTO THE RED AT THE BOTTOM OF 
THE PACK 
HE NEEDED TO FLICK THAT OUTSIDE 
READ ABOUT HALF BALL WHAT A POT THAT WAS 
TERRIFIC POT ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T 
GET THE CLEANEST CONTACT WITH HIS 
LAST SHOT HE STILL HAS GOT A SHOT 
AT HIS NEXT RED 
I WAS SAYING WITH YOU LAST NIGHT 
WHEN JAMIE COPE WAS PLAYING THEY 
ARE VERY SIMILAR AREN'T THEY 
DIFFERENT STYLE OF COURSE THERE 
BUT REALLY FEEL US OUT THERE 
FEARLESS 
I THINK THE WAY THAT ALLEN HAS 
ATTEMPTED THIS FRAME AND THE BALLS 
HE HAS POTTED SHOW WHAT HE IS MADE 
OF 
HAVING LOST THE FIRST THREE FATE 
FRAMES TWO OF THEM IN PRETTY 
SHATTERING CIRCUMSTANCES THIS IS A 
GOOD RESPONSE 
ONCE AGAIN HE DIDN'T GET THE 
CONTACT HE WAS HOPING FOR 
ALWAYS THE TROUBLE WITH THOSE SHOTS 
YOU'RE TRYING TO HOLD THE CUE BALL 
HE HAD A BIT ANGLE THERE TRYING TO 
HOLD IT FOR THE BLACK IF YOU MISS 
IT YOU ARE ALWAYS GOING TO MISS IT 
THICK 
SHAME BECAUSE THAT WAS A GREAT 
EFFORT NOT JUST IN TERMS OF THE 
SKILL THAT IS REQUIRED BUT THE 
MENTAL EFFORT AS WELL 
IT MAY NOT COST HIM THE GAME BUT 
IT'S GIVEN STEPHEN HENDRY THE 
CHANCE TO PINCH ANOTHER ONE 
IF HENDRY CLEARED UP YET AGAIN AND 
IT IT REALLY WOULD TAKE SOMETHING 
FOR HIM TO RECOVER FROM THAT 
HE IS STILL ON THE RED I THINK HE 
HAS GOT THREE POSSIBLES 
HE HAD TO PLAY IT WITH A BIT OF 
DRAG TO HOLD FOR THE BLACK AGAIN HE HAD THE RED TOO THICK 
THE RED HE POTTED WAS MUCH MORE 
DIFFICULT THAN THAT HE WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT PINK THE 
FRAME 
THERE IS NORMALLY ONE BITE OF THE 
CHERRY AT THIS STAGE IN THE FRAME 
THIS ISN'T AN EASY CLEARANCE FOR 
ANYONE 
HE HAS GOT TO MACRO REDS THAT ARE 
NEAR TO THE CUSHIONS ONE JUST OFF 
THE CUSHION 
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WIN THE FRAME AT 
THIS VISIT 
THAT DID GO ONE A BIT BUT SURELY 
THAT IS TO FIND THAT CHOICES HERE 
ARE A CROSS DOUBLE OFF THE RED BY 
THE PINK THERE IT LOOKS AS THOUGH 
HE IS OPTING FOR SAFETY 
STEPHEN IS HAVING A LOOK AROUND 
HERE AT THE RED DOWN TO THE RIGHT 
OF THE GREEN AGAIN THAT BROWN AND 
YELLOW IS THE PROBLEM BUT HE MAY 
HAVE ENOUGH ANGLE HERE TO STAND OUT 
FOR THE GREEN IN EITHER OF THE 
BOTTOM POCKETS I WAS SURPRISED AT THAT OUT OF CHARACTER 
WHAT MADE IT WORSE WAS THAT HE 
DIDN'T PLAY THE SAFETY AT ALL WELL 
OBVIOUSLY PLAYED FOR THE PINK THERE 
CLIVE 
CAN HE GET THROUGH TO THE RED ON 
THE OTHER SIDE PAST THE BLUE 
HE ALMOST WENT PAST THAT AND WOULD 
HAVE SNOOKERED HIMSELF 
HE HAS RISEN TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL 
CHALLENGE OF HAVING LOST THE FIRST 
THREE FRAMES TWO OF THEM IN 
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES 
ALAN HAS MANAGED TO TAKE THE LAST 
FRAME BEFORE THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL HE THEREFORE REGAINS THE 
LEAD AT SEVEN TO SIX WHEN YOU MENTIONED HOW 
MARK ALLEN WOULD RESPOND THERE WAS 
A CLEAR INDICATION THAT HE HAS DONE 
WELL 
HE HAS BEEN UNDER EXTREME WELL PRESSURE THIS AFTERNOON BRAINS YOU 
SHOULD HAVE WON HE HAS LOST HE 
HAS MISSED ONE OR TWO BALLS IN THE 
LAST FRAME PERFECTLY 
UNDERSTANDABLE BUT A COUPLE OF 
SCREAMING BALLS INTO THE FRAME 
WHAT HE HAS PROVED IS THAT NOTHING 
REALLY FAZES HIM HE LOOKED BIT 
NERVOUS AFTER LOSING THE FIRST 
THREE FRAMES BUT AS I SAID BEFORE 
THE FRAME IT WAS A BIGGER FRAME 
FOR MARK ALLEN IT WAS FOR HENDRY 
HENDRY WILL BE DELIGHTED TO BE BACK 
INTO THE MATCH BUT THAT WAS 
MISSED FRAME FOR MARK ALLEN USING USING STEPHEN HENDRY WILL BE SAINT HIMSELF 
IN THE DRESSING ROOM NOW 
HE WILL 
BE SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE HE 
IS SIXTY SIX WHEN YOU GET THAT 
OPPORTUNITY YOU ALWAYS WANT 
EVERYTHING AS WILLIE SAID IF HE 
LOOKS AT IT AND SAID HE HAD WAS 
HAPPY WITH A THREE TO ONE AND THAT MANY 
SESSION THAT'S GREAT HE IS RIGHT 
BACK INVOLVED IN THE MATCH WHERE AT 
SIX TO THREE HE WAS DISTANT 
MARK WILL BE 
SAYING HE WILL WEATHER THE STORM I I THINK SO HE POTTED A GREAT RED 
INTO THE MIDDLE POCKET ONE OF THE 
BEST SHOPS OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP HE 
KNOCKED A RED IN THE MIDDLE POCKET 
AT ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. AND GOT ON THE BLACK O. K. 
ENDED UP MISSING THAT BUT IT PROVED 
HE WAS FEELING CONFIDENT WHEN 
YOU'VE HAD WAUGH WHEN SLIGHTLY HAD 
ANOTHER THREE FRAMES IT'S HARD TO 
KEEP YOUR CONFIDENCE BUT HIS 
CONFIDENCE IS STILL THERE IT'S IT'S FASCINATING BECAUSE THE START OF 
THIS AFTERNOON AGAIN TALKING 
ABOUT EXPERIENCED AGAINST YOUTH 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS SHOWN HE HAS NO 
INTENTION OF LAYING DOWN 
NO AND 
HE IS CUEING WELL AS WELL MAYBE 
PERCENTAGE WISE IT'S NOT SO GREAT 
THAT THE LONG BALLS BUT THAT'S 
UNDERSTANDABLE IN THE BALLS HE 
STILL HITS THE BALLS REALLY NICE 
NOT QUITE ON A PLATFORM BUT ON THE 
FORECOURT OF SHEFFIELD TRAINING 
STATION INTO THE RUN OF THE 
STRATEGY IT 
WAS SNOOKER TABLE IT WAS THERE FOR TRAVELLERS AND 
COMMUTERS TO SHOW JOHN AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
CHAMPION SEAN MURPHY EXACTLY HOW 
GOOD THAT'S NO GOOD THEY WERE ALL 
THE SHOTS WERE FIRST CLASS OF 
COURSE 
THIS LOOKS LIKE OUR FIRST VICTIM 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME RAVE 
NICE TO ME RAVE TO 
DO YOU PLAY MUCH L. USED TO TO THE LONG POTS MY EYESIGHT ISN'T AS 
GOOD AS IT USED TO BE 
I CAN 
SYMPATHISE THERE WHEN YOU SAY 
SCREW SHOTS DOES THE CUE BALL NOT 
COME BACK ORDERS AT STUN IT IT DOESN'T USUALLY COME BACK WHAT WHAT NORMALLY HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE PLAY 
SCREW SHOTS AND STRUGGLE WITH THEM 
IS THAT THEY WILL HIT THE WHITE TO 
HIGHER UP AND IN TRYING TO BRING 
THE BALL BACK THEY WILL KIND OF HIT 
THE WHITE AND GO THROUGH WITH THE 
CUE AND THEN BRING IT BACK LIKE 
THAT RIGHT 
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT RIGHT IT IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU 
THINK GET LOW ON THE WHITE TRY 
AND KEEP YOUR CUE AS HIGH AS 
POSSIBLE PULLS UP THE OTHER ONE IS 
MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THROUGH 
SMOOTHLY IN ONE MOVEMENT 
HE'S NOT BAD IS HE DO YOU WANT TO 
HAVE A GO AT THIS HERE IS THE CUE 
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR COAT ON AND 
EVERYTHING BUT 
THE TRICK IS TO 
ONCE YOU PUT THE WHITE DON'T 
RECOIL STAY THERE STAY THERE AS 
LONG AS YOU CAN UNTIL THE WHITE 
COMES BACK 
A GOOD THING TO THINK 
ABOUT IS WHEN YOU FOLLOW THROUGH 
TRY AND PUT YOUR TIP ON THE RED 
BALL 
IMAGINE AS IF YOU ARE TRYING TO DO 
THAT NEELY 
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED TO TAKE THE CUE 
BACK A LITTLE BIT 
YOU NEARLY POTTED THE BROWN WELL WELL DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
MORE FROM SHEFFIELD TRAIN STATION 
TOMORROW GIVEN HIS RECENT 
PERFORMANCES THERE'S NO SURPRISE 
THAT MARK SELBY ARRIVED IN 
SHEFFIELD AS ONE OF THE FAVOURITES 
TO WIN THE WORLD TITLE TERRIFIC 
SEASON LAST YEAR REACH THE FINAL 
OF LAST YEAR'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
AND IT HELPED HIM CLIMB UP TO 
NUMBER ELEVEN IN THE WORLD RANKINGS HE 
BUILD ON THAT SUCCESS BY WINNING 
THE MASTERS TITLE AT WEMBLEY AND 
THE WELSH OPEN TITLE THE TWENTY FOUR YEAR 
OLD HAS ESTABLISHED HIMSELF QUICKLY 
AS ONE OF THE TOP PLAYERS ON THE 
CIRCUIT THERE'S A TOUGH OPPONENT 
IN MARK KING ROMFORD WORLD NUMBER 
TWENTY ONE HAS A GRITTY COMPETITOR THIS IS 
HIS TENTH CRUCIBLE APPEARANCE ON 
HIS DAY MARK HAS THE GAME TO WORRY 
ANYONE ON THE CIRCUIT HE HAS 
REACHED TWO FINALS IN RANKING 
TOURNAMENTS NEVER PAST THE LAST SIXTEEN 
IN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP HIS AIM 
IS TO CHANGE THAT THIS TIME ROUND 
IN THE FIRST FRAME OF THIS MATCH 
MARK KING IS FORTY EIGHT POINTS UP 
MARKING PLAYED THAT SHOT THERE AS 
IF HE DIDN'T REALLY FANCY THE POT 
HE PLAYED IT AS A SHOT TO NOTHING 
THIS IS A VERY TOUGH CHANCE TO WIN 
THE FRAME 
BUT WE SAW HIM PINCHED FRAME SITE 
THIS THE ROBBER CHAMPIONSHIP 
THROUGHOUT THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
YES HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF AN ANGLE 
HERE SO HE CAN GET UP TO THE TWO 
REDS HE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE HE 
DOESN'T SNOOKER HIMSELF WITH THE 
YELLOW 
THAT WAS WELL JUDGED THAT HAS GONE TOO FAR THAT WAS NOT BAT HE THROWS THE 
CHOP MACK IN THE AIR THAT TELLS 
YOU HE WILL NEED LITTLE BIT OF 
HELP CHALK THE FRACTION EITHER 
WAY AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN O. K. HE 
CAN ONLY ROLE THIS IN NOW HE 
CANNOT GET A GOOD POSITION HE 
CAN ONLY ROLE FOR US ASH HE CAN 
ONLY DROP THIS INNER 
HE IS ASKING FOR THE EXTENDED 
SPIDER L. AM NOT EVEN SURE IF THEY 
MAKE THAT 
THEY HAVE GOT EVERYTHING 
UNDER THE TABLE THESE DAYS 
THE THING IS IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
SEE THE SHOT AND HE IS QUITE A 
TALL MAN AS WELL L. THINK HE WILL NEED AN EXTENSION FOR HIS EXTENSION 
A GOOD DEFRA EFFORT IT 
GIVES HIMSELF A CHANCE TO POP THE 
YELLOW THEN THE YELLOW WILL BE 
REPLACED ON TO ITS SPOT 
IF ONLY THE YELLOW WAS A LITTLE BIT 
STRAIGHTER 
KEY SHOT COMING UP IN THIS OPENING 
FRAME 
HE IS FACED WITH A TOUGH YEAR LOW 
YELLOW 
WHAT A SHOT IT IS A PITY THAT HE 
HAS FINISHED AWKWARD ON THE GREEN ANOTHER GREAT SHOT HOW ABOUT THAT 
THIS IS A NATURAL BROWN TO BLUE IT 
IS ALMOST PLAIN BALL WITH THE REST 
IT IS HEADING DOWN TOWARDS THE BLUE 
I WONDER IF IT IS HEADING TOWARDS 
THE MIDDLE POCKET WITHOUT A TRACE 
OF SIDE 
YOU WANT TO GET AS CLOSE TO THE 
BLUE AS POSSIBLE THAT WAS THE BEST HE COULD DO 
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL SHOT HE HAS 
PLAYED ABOUT FOUR AND STANDING 
SHOTS IN THIS BREAK THIS WILL BE 
SOME CLEAR ROUNDS OUTSTANDING 
WHAT A PERFORMANCE THIS IS MARK 
KING LOOKED ODDS ON TO TAKE THIS 
OPENING FRAME THEN SUDDENLY MARK 
SELBY HAS PRODUCED A CLEARANCE LIKE 
THIS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT WHAT A 
CLEARANCE WHAT A BREAK OF FIFTY FIVE IT 
GIVES THE FRAME TO MARK SELBY MORE MORE ON THAT MATCH OVER THE COURSE OF 
THE AFTERNOON WHAT A PLAYER THE THE FIRST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS I THOUGHT 
HE WAS GOING TO BE A MAN WHO WOULD 
ALWAYS BE AROUND THE TOP THIRTY TWO THEN 
HE IS BREAK BUILDING THAT WAS ONE 
OF THE BEST BREAKS I HAVE EVER SEEN 
AT THE CRUCIBLE 
THANK YOU NOW WE 
HAVE AN ARTIST IN RESIDENCE HERE 
IT IS TOM WALKER 
HERE WE ARE WITH 
A RESIDENT ARTIST TOM WHAT IS 
HAPPENING SO FOR 
WE HEARD A SMALL 
BANG YESTERDAY THE EARLIEST 
SETTLEMENT IN SHEFFIELD WAS WHERE 
THE RIVERS MEET WHEN THEY 
EXCAVATED TO THE FOUNDATIONS THEY 
DISCOVERED THIS BURIAL CHAMBER WITH 
FIFTEEN PORTS SIXTEENTH IF YOU INCLUDE THIS 
PINK ONE HISTORY IS LITTERED WITH 
POTS THIS WAS A BURIAL CHAMBER 
FROM THE IRON AGE 
YOU DON'T ALWAYS 
STICK TO A SET PATTERN 
NO AM 
KEEPING MY OPTIONS OPEN HOME IN 
QUICKLY ON THIS BLACKBALL YOU CAN 
SEE A FIGURE HER NAME IS CIVIL 
ALL WILL BECOME CLEAR IN THE NEAR 
FUTURE CIVIL 
THANK YOU VERY 
INTERESTING WE WILL COME BACK AND 
CHECK ON YOUR PROGRESS LET US JUST 
GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHERE WE ARE 
YOU COME ALONG AND GO THROUGH THESE 
BLAKE BIG BLACK DOORS YOU CAN 
SEE THE VENUE HERE MARK ALLEN 
LEADS STEPHEN HENDRY HERE 
ONE WILL 
GO ON TO THE SECOND ROUND AND ONE 
WILL GO HOME 
IT WOULD UPSET A LOT OF PLAYERS TO 
HAVE LOST THE FIRST THREE FRAMES 
THIS AFTERNOON AS MARK ALLEN DID 
HE DID SAY TO SOMEONE DURING THE 
MIDSESSION INTERVAL I FELT GREAT 
ALL THE WAY THROUGH GREAT 
TEMPERAMENT AS WELL AS GREAT 
POTENTIAL NORTHERN IRELAND'S GREAT PROSPECT 
DOHERTY DID TURN OVER ONE BIG NAME 
PLAYER THAT WAS LAST YEAR 
HENDRY IS PLAYING MUCH BETTER THIS 
YEAR TRICKY SHOT WORTH A TRY 
THE REFRESHING THING ABOUT THESE 
YOUNG LADS IS THAT THE TAKE BALLS 
ON THEY TAKE 
I AM SURE THE CROWD HERE HAS 
ENJOYED FALSE FIRST FOUR FRAMES 
THOSE FIRST FOUR FRAMES THERE WERE 
SO MANY TWISTS AND TURNS 
HE HAS CAUGHT THAT EFFECT HE IS O. K. 
IT COULD HAVE GONE WRONG HE HAS 
CAUGHT THAT EFFECT 
ON HIS LAST VISIT TO THE TABLE HE 
SPREAD THE REDS 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE PINK PASSES 
AFTER THIS RARE PERHAPS IT DIDN'T 
THIS RED THAT WAS AWKWARD BRIDGING 
THE PINK IS NOW AVAILABLE TO LEFT 
MIDDLE 
HE HAS GONE A LITTLE FURTHER THAN 
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED 
HE IS UP FOR THE BLUE AGAIN 
STRANGE SHOT THAT PINK COULD HAVE 
BEEN FOR BALL 
HE HAS GOT VERY LITTLE ANGLE ON 
THIS BLUE NOT ENOUGH TO FORCE IN 
AND OUT OF THE BAULK AREA 
HE SHOULD GO ON TO CLINCH THIS 
FRAME THAT THIS VISIT 
ONE QUESTION THAT HAS TO BE ASKED 
HOW DO YOU REACT TO SETBACKS 
OF THE GREAT CHAMPIONS THEY ALL 
HAVE THAT SPECIAL INGREDIENT GUTS THEY ALL HAVE SKILL AS WELL 
WITH THAT FLYING BREAK OF EIGHTY NINE MARK 
ALLEN GOES TWO FRAMES CLEAR AGAIN 
HE LEADS STEPHEN HENDRY WILLIE WILLIE THORNE AND JOHN PARROTT ARE 
ENJOYING THIS MATCH IT IS TERRIFIC 
STUFF 
VERY VERY GOOD WHAT HAS STUFF HAPPENED TO HIM SOMETIMES YOUR 
OPPONENT CAN COME OUT AND MAKE 
THREE CENTURY BREAKS HOWEVER HE 
HAS BOUNCED BACK 
I HAVE NOT SEEN 
ENOUGH OF THEM OVER THE LAST FEW 
YEARS L. KNOW HE IS ACOL THE 
GREAT PLAYER AFTER TODAY TO DO IT 
AGAINST A LEGEND HE CAN GO A LONG 
LONG WAY IN THIS GAME 
BACK TO CLIVE AND TERRY DON'T DON'T THINK HENDRY WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO 
SAY ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF THIS MATCH 
HOWEVER HE IS TWO FRAMES BEHIND 
HE IS ACTUALLY PLAYING WELL 
THAT WAS A MOMENTUM STOPPER FOR 
MARK ALLEN 
HE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT 
ONE IT WAS NOT A CERTAINTY BUT YOU 
FELT HE WAS GOING TO GET IT 
IF HENDRY DOESN'T WIN THIS FRAME 
HE WOULD HAVE TO WIN FOUR IN A ROW 
HE HIT THAT QUITE WELL BUT THE 
SECOND STAGE OF THE SPIN DIDN'T 
TAKE OFF HE WAS BLOWING OUT HIS CHEEKS 
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE IT 
IS DIFFICULT 
IT IS NOT JUST LUCK IT IS REACTION 
TO IT SOME GOOD PLAYERS TEND TO BE 
RATHER SELF PITYING IF LUCK GOES 
AGAINST THEM THE GREAT PLAYERS 
INEVITABLY JUST GET ON WITH IT THE CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH HAMPERED FOR THE BLACK 
WHAT SHOULD BE GREEN IT THOUGHT 
ABOUT IT A FEW TIMES 
HE IS THE MASTER OF BREAK BUILDING 
ISN'T HE CLIVE 
HE HAS PRACTISED SO HARD AND STUDY 
SO MUCH THAT HE HAS BROUGHT OUT ALL 
THE SUBTLETIES YOU HAVE POINTED 
THEM OUT IN THIS BREAK 
NOT QUITE THIS TIME CONTACT COULD 
HAVE BEEN BAD BECAUSE HE IS ASKING 
FOR THE BALL TO BE CLEANED GOOD POT 
HE CONTROLLED THE CANNON HE IS PLAYING WELL BOTH PLAYERS ARE IT HAS BEEN VERY ENTERTAINING HE DIDN'T WANT TO CANNON THE RED LIKE THAT THAT WAS A GREAT POT 
THIS IS THE BEST POSITION HE HAS 
HAD FOR THREE SHOTS VERY MUCH 
ODDS ON THAT HE'S GOING TO CLINCH 
THE FRAME 
THIS IS NOT FAR OFF THE BEST 
STANDARD THAT HENDRY HAS PRODUCED 
THIS SEASON IN THE BREAK BUILDING 
DEPARTMENT 
HE HAS HAD RUNS OF ONE HUNDRED TEN NINETY THREE SIXTY EIGHT SIXTY FOUR 
PLUS THIS EFFORT 
UNCHARACTERISTICALLY AND CERTAINLY 
NOT SOMETHING THAT HE IS NOTED FOR 
WHO RESCUED THE FIRST FRAME THIS 
AFTERNOON FROM TWO SNOOKERS NEEDED 
HE HAS NOT ONLY WON THIS FRAME BUT 
WHEN IT WELL 
WITH THAT SIXTY FIVE BREAK STEPHEN HENDRY 
REDUCES HIS ARREARS TO SINGLE 
FRAME HE STILL TRAILS BY EIGHTY SEVEN WHAT 
IS THE STANDARD OF THIS MATCH THE THE BEST SO FAR I THINK EVERY FRAME 
IS TOP CLASS PETER EBDON'S MATCH 
WITH JAMIE COPE WHEN TEN TO NINE BUT THIS 
HAS BEEN TOP DRAWER STUFF RIGHT THE 
WAY THROUGH THAT MATCHES EXCITING 
NEAR THE END BUT THIS ONE HAS HAD 
IT 
SOME OF THE OTHER GAMES THEY IT HAVE NEEDED TWO OR THREE CHANCES 
EVERYBODY COMES IN GETTING FORTY OR 
ABOVE A FEW THERE ARE SHOTS HAD 
BEEN MISSED HERE AND THERE ARE TO 
PLAY THIS KIND OF STANDARD IN THE 
FIRST ROUND IS VERY GOOD INDEED 
HENDRY BACK IN AGAIN NOW L. THINK 
IF HENDRY WINS THIS FRAME I MAKE 
HIM FAVOURITE IF MARK ALLEN WINS 
IT IT IT WILL BE TOUGH FOR HIM TOOK 
LOSE 
I THINK IT HAS TEN TO NINE WRITTEN LOSE ALL OVER IT 
THE WHO WILL WIN AGAIN 
THOUGH 
I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT TO THOUGH TO SAY THE STANDARD THAT WE ARE SEEING 
TODAY TO GET ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR 
FRAMES OUT OF THIS MATCH WILL BE 
GREAT 
MARK ALLEN IS UP AGAIN GREAT STEPHEN HENDRY NOW IT'S A GREAT 
AFTERNOON FOR BOTH PLAYERS MARK MARK ALLEN PROVED TO HIMSELF LAST YEAR 
HE COULD COMPETE AT THE CRUCIBLE 
ANTHONY WIN MATCHES AT THE CRUCIBLE 
YOU'RE NEVER QUITE SURE HOW YOU 
WILL COMPETE THERE 
THESE ARE THE 
GAMES THAT YOU FIND OUT WHETHER YOU 
ARE DESTINED FOR THE ABSOLUTE TOP 
ALLEN'S BREAK OFF SHOT IS VERY 
FREQUENTLY LEAVING THIS TYPE OF 
OPENING POT FOR HENDRY 
HAVING POTTED IT HENDRY WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE CANNONED THE 
BLACK 
HE HAS JUST ABOUT LEFT HIMSELF ON 
THE ON THE RED HE COULD GET ON AT 
THE BACK OF THE PACK 
AT THAT PACE IT LOOKED AS IF THAT 
HAD TO DROP IN 
JUST A FRACTION TOO MUCH ON TO THE 
NEAR JAW 
HE GOT THE RED BUT JUST SLIP UP ON 
THE POSITION 
HE WAS TRYING TO SCREW ALONG THE 
CUSHION FOR THE BLACK 
STEPHEN HENDRY MADE AMATEUR WHAT 
ANGLE HE GOT ON THE RED BUT I'VE 
SEEN HIM PLAY THIS SHOT MANY TIMES 
SWING THE BALL INTO THE PACK OF THE 
REDS AND HOLD FOR THE BLACK THERE 
HE HAVE THE ANGLE TO GO ROUND 
INSIDE THE PACK 
THE ADVANTAGE OF PLAYING IT THAT 
WAY NORMALLY IS THAT YOU CAN'T 
REALLY LEAVE 
ANYTHING ON BUT HE 
BUT HE HAS PUT A FEW REDS AND THE PACK AND 
ONE HAS COME BACK OVER KNOCKED 
ANOTHER RED AND PUT IT INTO A 
POTABLE POSITION FOR MARK ALLEN 
THE BOYS IN THE STUDIO WERE SAYING 
THAT THIS IS A ONE SCORING VISIT 
IN SOME WAY THAT PUTS ITS OWN 
PRESSURE ON AS YOU COME CLOSER TO 
THE MAGIC TEN THAT BOTH PLAYERS ARE 
TRYING TO GET TO YOU THINK IF I 
DON'T MADE EIGHT HERE I WILL 
PROBABLY LOSE THE FRAME 
ALLEN WITHIN TWO FRAMES FOR A PLACE 
IN THE LAST SIXTEEN 
THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE FRAME IN THIS 
MATCH WITH THE HIGHEST BREAK LOWER 
THAN FORTY SEVEN VERY HEAVY SCORING FROM 
BOTH PLAYERS 
YOU JUST FEEL HE IS ON THE EDGE OF 
TAKING THIS FRAME HE GETS ONE MORE 
RED IN A GOOD POSITION HE SHOULD 
GO ON AND CLINCH IT HOW MUCH YOU GET FOR BEING CLOSE 
THE TROUBLE WAS AT THE PREVIOUS 
SHOT HE GOT BIT TOO STRAIGHT ON 
THE BLACK IT COULD DOWN HIS 
POSITIONAL OPTIONS 
THE SAVING GRACE FOR THIS RED DOWN 
TOWARDS THE BAULK AREA HE DIDN'T 
HAVE A GOOD ANGLE OTHERWISE ON THE 
BLACK 
O. K. THERE IS PRESSURE OUT THERE BUT 
THIS IS NO MORE THAN EVEN MONEY FOR 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
THIS IS WHAT HE HAS PRACTISED FOR 
THIS IS WHAT HE WANTS ABOVE ALL TO 
BE IN CONTENTION AGAIN AT THE 
CRUCIBLE 
IT TURNS OUT YOU ARE RIGHT BECAUSE 
THERE WAS NOTHING VERY DIFFICULT 
ABOUT THAT STRAIGHT RED STUN RUN 
THROUGH 
IT DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD HAVE 
MISSED THAT ONE THAT'S A TERRIBLE 
DISAPPOINTMENT 
HE LOOKS TO BE HITTING THE BALL SO 
WELL STEPHEN HENDRY THAT ODD SHOT 
THAT HE MISSES LIKE THAT ONE WELL 
THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT TIME IN HIS 
HEYDAY HE NEVER SEEMED TO MISS THE 
CHANCE TO CLEAR UP 
WHILE HENDRY NURSE'S HIS 
DISAPPOINTMENT DONE THE NEEDFUL 
HENDRY HAD A CHANCE TO SNATCH THE 
FRAME BUT HE IS FORCED TO CONCEDE 
IT HENDRY TWO DOWN WITH THREE TO 
PLAY ALLEN NINE TO SEVEN UP HENDRY HAS BEEN 
LEFT TO RUE STRAIGHT RED FROM NOT 
VERY FAR AWAY 
HE WAS IN FOR A POSSIBLE WINNING 
CLEARANCE UNFORCED ERROR WOULD 
NEVER HAVE MISSED IT IN HIS PRIME 
BUT HE HAS PLAYED A GREAT DEAL 
BETTER IN THIS MATCH THAN HE HAS 
PLAYED FOR MOST OF THE SEASON THE 
NUMBER OF UNFORCED ERRORS HAS 
DROPPED TO VERY LOW INDEED BUT 
THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT ONE BUNGLED BREAK OFF SHOT AS WELL HE CLIPPED THE BLUE FIN THIN 
MARK ALLEN HAS GOT ALL OF HIS 
FAMILY HERE FROM IRELAND THERE ARE 
ABOUT SIXTY A SEVENTY PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME 
HERE TO SUPPORT HIM 
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TOO BOYS JUST 
TODAY I MUST SAY L. THINK THAT'S 
OUT OF RESPECT FOR STEPHEN HENDRY 
BOISTEROUS 
HE WAS AFTER THE RED ABOVE THE 
BLACK 
HE POTTED THE BLACK A LITTLE BIT 
BIGGER THAN INTENDED 
AS USUAL THE CRUCIBLE AUDIENCE 
ENGROSSED IN THE ACTION 
WHERE ELSE WOULD YOU BE AT THIS 
TIME OF YEAR THIS IS THE PLACE 
AN EXCELLENT SAFETY SHOT STEVENS 
SAFETY NEEDS TO BE STRONG THAT 
LOOKS AT THE MOMENT THAT MARK ALLEN 
WILL KNOCK ANYTHING IN THAT HE 
LEAVES OUT OR AT LEAST GOES FOR IT 
AND GET MOST OF THEM 
HE WAS FORCED INTO THAT EVEN ALAN 
WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED TO PLAY THAT 
IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY ALTERNATIVE 
EVEN WITH THE AWKWARD BRIDGING 
HE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED HIM TO GET 
THAT 
HE CERTAINLY EXPECTED TO ALTHOUGH 
HE DID NOT THAT MICAELA CLEAR TO 
PUT CLEAN THE CUE BALL 
MARK ALLEN'S SECOND CHANCE IN THIS 
FRAME IT'S THE ONE HE NEEDS TO 
SECURE VICTORY HE'S NOT NORMALLY 
SHY WHEN IT COMES TO THE WINNING 
LINE BUT THIS IS A BIG OCCASION 
THIS IS THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE 
HE IS UP AGAINST THE LEGEND 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
EVEN SO ALLEN HAS BEATEN HENDRY 
BEFORE 
I THINK THAT MISTAKE WAS HUMAN 
ERROR FROM STEPHEN HENDRY L. DIDN'T DETECT KICK WITH THAT 
THAT IS VERY UNLUCKY 
HE TOOK ON 
THE POSITIVE SHOT TAKEN A CHANCE 
ALLEN HAS BEEN IN TWICE BUT SCORED 
ONLY ELEVEN AND SIXTEEN 
AND BOTH TIMES HIS 
POSITION HAS LET HIM DOWN RATHER 
THAN MISSING A POT 
WITH HIS SAFETY HENDRY WAS 
DEPENDING ON GIVING THAT RED BEHIND 
BUT BY LEAVING IT OUT THERE IS A 
GREAT DANGER OF ALLEN KNOCKING IN 
HE DID EVERYTHING BUT POT IT WHERE 
THE REDS ARE IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN 
A GREAT CHANCE ANYWAY BUT AT LEAST 
WE WERE ON THE TABLE STEPHEN 
HENDRY HAS LOOKED AT THIS LONG RED 
AND IT'S NOT VERY NICE PARTLY 
BECAUSE OF THE BRIDGING HE HAS PLAYED THE SAFETY 
DIDN'T QUITE GET IT RIGHT THIS RED 
IS ON IT'S VERY THIN BUT IT'S 
AVAILABLE 
THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM A BETTER 
POSITION AND LESS CHANCE OF 
POSSIBLY LEAVING ANYTHING ON FOR 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
WE'RE HAVING A FEW ERRORS AND IT 
ALL ADDS TO THE TENSION AND 
ENJOYMENT FOR THE SPECTATORS 
AND IT TESTS THE CHARACTERS AND 
TEMPERAMENTS NOT TO SAY THE 
TECHNIQUE OF THE PLAYERS 
WILL THEIR TECHNIQUE HOLD UP UNDER 
EXTREME PRESSURE 
A BIT UNLUCKY TO SEE THEIR RED GO 
SO CLOSE TO THE POCKET THAT IT 
STAYED ON AIR 
IT'S GIVEN STEPHEN HENDRY A CHANCE 
TO GET BACK INTO THE FRAME AND 
MAYBE TAKE IT PERFECTLY BIDED GUIDED INTO THE LEAD WITH THAT BLACK GOOD POSITIONAL SHOT REQUIRED HERE 
IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD THE PINK IS 
THE PROBLEM BALL HERE NORMALLY IT 
IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD SHOT NORMALLY 
YOU ARE OFF THE BOTTOM CUSHION AND 
THE SIDE AND INTO THOSE REDS 
HE IS VERY UNLUCKY HE HAD TO FIND 
THE GAP BETWEEN THOSE TWO MACRO 
REDS TO GET ON A POT 
THE PINK WAS IN HIS NATURAL PATH OF 
WHERE HE WANTED TO GO BECAUSE OF 
THAT IT'S END OF BREAK SIXTEEN POINTS 
IN FRONT 
COULD ONLY RELY ON LENGTH DEAD 
WEIGHT TO THE BAULK CUSHION TO MAKE 
THIS NEXT SHOT DIFFICULT IN ANY WAY 
THAT COULD BE A WINNER NEEDS A 
GOOD KISS 
A GREAT TIME TO PULL OUT A SHOT 
LIKE THAT VIRTUALLY TIGHT ON THE 
BAULK CUSHION 
SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM IN 
CLINCHING THE FRAME NOW 
HAD TO GO IN AND OUT OF BAULK BUT 
THERE WAS NO OBSTRUCTING BALL ON 
THAT SIDE OF THE TABLE JUST THE RED AND A COLOUR NEEDED 
SO HENDRY GETS FULL VALUE FROM THE 
EXCELLENT LONG RED 
WHICH STARTED THIS DECISIVE 
CONTRIBUTION 
BREAKS OF THIRTY SEVEN AND TWENTY NINE FROM STEPHEN 
HENDRY A SOLID FRAME FROM HIM HE 
REDUCES ARREARS BUT MARK ALLEN IS 
STILL ONE UP 
SMILING FACES IN HERE YOU ARE 
HOPING IT GOES TO THE FINAL FRAME 
FOR THE CONNOISSEURS IT IS NICE TO 
GO TO THE FINAL FRAME WHAT WE'RE 
SEEING THIS AFTERNOON IS PROBABLY 
THE BEST MATCH SO FAR IN THE 
TOURNAMENT IT IS EARLY DAYS YET 
BUT BOTH THESE PLAYERS ARE HITTING 
THE BALL QUITE WELL HENDRY IS 
OCCASIONALLY THROWING A BAD ONE IN 
BUT IN THE BALLS HE IS LOOKING O. K. 
PEOPLE AT HOME ARE HOPING IT GOES 
TO THE FINAL FRAME 
IT HAS BEEN 
FANTASTIC SOME MATCHES STRAIGHT ON 
IT IS NOT ALWAYS ENTERTAINING BUT 
THIS HAS GONE VERY QUICKLY STEPHEN 
HAS HIT 
THE BALL WELL L. SAID AT THE BEGINNING IF HE CAN WIN ONE 
GAME PLAYING WELL IT MAY BE THE 
CATALYST FOR HIM TO FIND HIS BEST 
FORM THIS IS THE TYPE OF MATCH 
THAT IF HE CAN GET OVER THE LINE 
AGAINST MARK ALLEN HE MAY TAKE OFF 
LET'S CATCH UP WITH THE RESULT OF 
THE OTHER MATCH RYAN DAY PLAYING 
MICHAEL JUDGE AND RYAN DAY 
CHARGING UP THE WORLD RANKINGS OF 
LATE HE PLAYS JOHN HIGGINS'S NEXT 
A GOOD PLAYER RYAN DAY BY BY COMMENTATED ON THE SECOND SESSION 
HE SCORED A VERY WELL THE ONE 
THING THAT WORRIES ME ABOUT HIM HE 
IS A VERY IMPETUOUS HE WANTS TO GO 
FOR EVERYTHING NOW WHEN THE GAME 
YOU DON'T GET THAT CHANCE MICHAEL 
DID NOT PLAY WELL UNTIL THE END OF 
THE GAME HE TENDS TO GO FOR ONE 
TOO MANY FOR ME 
EVERYBODY WANTS 
TO GET OVER THE FIRST HURDLE 
STEPHEN HENDRY AGAINST MARK ALLEN 
WE HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE 
AGAINST THE YOUNG MAN COMING INTO 
THE GAME TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD IF HE WINS 
THIS HE GET INTO THE TOP SIXTEEN 
STEPHEN DOES NOT WANT TO DROP DOWN 
THE WORLD RANKINGS 
EVERYTHING TO 
PLAY FOR THEY AGREE THIS IS THE 
BEST STEPHEN HAS PLAYED FOR A WHILE 
I AGREE IT IS EASY TO COMPETE 
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING WELL BUT HE IS 
IN THERE COMPETING WELL AS FOR 
MARK ALLEN IT HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC 
PERFORMANCE HE IS NOW JUST HOPING 
TO GET ONE GOOD CHANCE IN THE BALLS 
AND HOPEFULLY GET OVER THE LINE 
THE THING WITH MARK ALLEN WHEN HE 
GETS A CHANCE HE CAN SCORE UNDER 
PRESSURE WHEN HENDRY WON THREE 
FRAMES HE MADE SEVENTY PLUS BREAK 
LET'S SEE IF HE CAN DO IT AGAIN 
BACK TO CLIVE AND TERRY 
IS THIS THE LAST FRAME OR ONLY THE 
LAST BUT ONE A LITTLE BIT TOO STRONG THERE 
I THINK HE HAS LEFT STEPHEN HENDRY 
SOMETHING TO GO AT 
IF HE GETS THIS ONE HE WILL BE ON 
THE BLUE 
I THINK HE MAY BE OKAY THE BLUE IT 
MAY BE COMING TO HELP HIM OUT THERE NOT AN EASY BALL THAT 
THEY HAVE GOT TO COMMIT THEMSELVES 
TO IT BY THAT I MEAN TAKING 
THINGS ON L. L. THINK BOTH OF THESE 
PLAYERS ARE PUMPED UP THEY WILL 
WANT TO GO FOR ANYTHING THAT IS 
AVAILABLE 
GREAT POT BUT HE ACTUALLY HIT IT 
TOO GOOD HE WENT DOWN PAST THE 
AVAILABLE BROWN AND GREEN 
A BOOMING LONG POT FROM MARK ALLEN 
IT GAVE HIM THE CHANCE TO PLAY THE 
SNOOKER HENDRY SHOULD BE O. K. IF HE 
CAN NESTLE INTO THE LEFT HAND SIDE 
OF THE BUNCH 
HE IS JUST GOING TO HAVE TO MISS 
THE KNUCKLE OF THE LEFT MIDDLE 
IF THE WHITE KIDS JUST BELOW THE 
LEFT MIDDLE POCKET HE SHOULD BE O. K. 
IF THE WHITE HIT THAT LOOKS A 
BETTER ANGLE 
HE HAS HIT THE RED BUT LEFT A BALL 
ON 
SO THE FIRST CHANCE AND THIS FRAME 
GOES TO MARK ALLEN IN THIS FRAME 
THE BLACK IS AVAILABLE 
HAS HE HIT THAT HARD ENOUGH IT IS 
TIGHT 
MARK ALLEN ASKED MICHAELA TABB THE 
REFEREE TO RE SPOT THE BLACK TO 
MAKE SURE IT WAS RIGHT ON ITS SPOT 
HE HAD TO PUT A TOUCH OF SIDE ON 
TO HELP THE POT INTO THE POCKET 
THESE ARE THE DANGEROUS TIMES WHEN 
YOU FEEL IT IS YOUR CHANCE TO WIN 
IT AND YOU PUSH THE BOAT OUT TOO 
FAR 
COULD BE A FREE BALL HERE I THINK 
IT IS 
YES IT IS NOT JUST BOTH 
EDGES OF ANY RED BUT IT IS BOTH 
EDGES OF REDS IN COMBINATION SO 
FREE BALL HENDRY NOMINATE BROWN AS 
HIS EXTRA RED NOMINATES 
STRAIGHT INTO THEM AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE 
PERHAPS THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS 
THE ONLY ONE HE IS ON 
HE HAS SLIPPED SLIGHTLY OUT OF 
POSITION STILL OKAY WITH THE RED 
TO THE RIGHT OF THE BLACK 
HE PLAYED FOR THE BLUE MAY STILL 
TAKE IT ON AS MATTER OF FACT 
ONCE AGAIN CHOSE TO GO INTO THE 
PACK OF REDS TO OPEN THE FRAME OUT 
ONCE AGAIN NOT AS INTENDED DIDN'T 
CATCH THE RED FULL ON 
IF HENDRY EVER MISSES THAT SHOT HE 
ALMOST ALWAYS MISSES IT ON THE SIDE 
CUSHION DRAW JAW 
HAS HENDRY BLOWN IT MEANWHILE 
THERE IS AN INTERRUPTION THERE IS 
A QUERY ON THE SCOREBOARD 
I THINK THERE WAS A SIX FOR A FOUL FOR 
MARK ALLEN AT THE MOMENT THEY 
HAVE ONLY PUT THE FOUR ON
