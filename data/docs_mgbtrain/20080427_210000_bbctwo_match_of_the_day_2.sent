GOOD EVENING WE HAVE HIGHLIGHTS OF 
BOTH OF TODAY'S MATCHES AND ALL OF 
YESTERDAY'S GOAL HERE THE GREATEST 
DOUBLE ACT IN THE HISTORY OF SUNDAY 
NIGHT SOCCER GAVIN PEACOCK AND LEE 
DIXON EVERTON VERSUS ASTON VILLA 
WAS ABOUT FIFTH PLACE AND THE UEFA 
CUP AFTER FLIRTING WITH THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE ANYTHING LESS 
THAN EUROPE WOULD BE A 
DISAPPOINTMENT FOR EVERTON BUT 
VILLA FANCY IT TOO AND HAVE BEEN 
SCORING OF LATE THERE IS SOMETHING 
DELIGHTFUL ABOUT THE WAY VILLA 
CELEBRATE THEIR MANY GOALS AT THE 
MOMENT THEY ENJOY SCORING THEM AND 
WHY NOT THEY SHOW THEIR DELIGHT 
ALL VERY UNFASHIONABLE IN THE DAY 
AND AGE OF GLOUERING SORT OF 
ININTRODECK R. SPECKION AND THE ODD 
BIT OF BOXING TIM CAHILL'S ABSENCE 
HAS BEEN A FACTOR DEFEAT TODAY 
WOULD SEE MOYES' BOYS SURRENDER 
FIFTH SPOT 
FIFTH SPOT 
NO TWO CLUBS HAVE 
FIFTH SPOT NO TWO CLUBS HAVE CLASHED MORE THAN THESE IN 
ENGLAND'S TOP FLIGHT THIS IS A 
SIGNIFICANT ONE WITH THE VICTORS 
TO TAKE POLE POSITION IN THE RACE 
FOR FIFTH AND A PLACE IN EUROPE IT 
HAS BEEN A TEN DAY SINCE EVERTON 
LAST PLAYED OSMAN FOR HIBBERT IS THE ONLY CHANGE BY MOYES HERE TO SEE WHETHER GOODISON PARK HAS GOT TALENT AMANDA HOLDEN YA BUKU FIRES 
IN YAKUBU FIRES IN IT WAS FIERCE BUT IT WAS ALWAYS WIZING WIDE BARRY GOES FOR GOAL HOWARD WAS A 
SPECTATOR I THINK HE WAS CONFIDENT 
IT WAS GOING WIDE BUT IT WAS HIT 
HARD AND TRUE BY VILLA'S CAPTAIN MISHIT TAMELY WIDE SWIFT EVERTON 
BREAK LOOK AT THE POWER AND PACE 
OF YAKUBU REO COKER COULDN'T STOP 
HIM TERRIFIC EFFORT BEATEN OUT BY 
CARSON WHO WAS KICKLY BACK TO HIS 
FEET IN CASE FERNANDES WAS TO FIND 
THE TARGET WITH THE REBOUND MELLBERG KEEPS ON GOING AND WINS A 
FREE KICK RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE 
EVERTON PENALTY AREA IT IS ASHLY YOUNG OFF THE 
UNDERSIDE OF THE BAR IT IS STILL 
SHAKING A TERRIFIC EFFORT FROM 
YOUNG HOWARD WAS NOT EXPECTING 
THAT LIKE AN AROW ARROW THEY 
STARTED THE FIRST HALF AT ONE HUNDRED 
ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. MOYES' TEAM CARSON IS STRUGGLING TO DEAL WITH 
THAT CROSS FROM FERNANDES IT IS 
BEHIND FOR AN EVERTON CORNER 
CARSLEY THINKS WHEN HE PINGED THE 
BALL TOWARDS THE BOX HE SHOULD HAVE 
GOT A HAND BALL IT DOES OFF URE 
COME OFF THE ARM OF PETROV IT IS THE BIG TALKING POINT OF THE 
WEEKEND AFTER MICHAEL CARRICK AT 
STAMFORD BRIDGE YESTERDAY NEVILLE STRIKES AND IT IS DEFLECTED 
IN MARTIN LAURSEN APPLIES THE 
TOUCH PHIL NEVILLE TAKES THE 
CREDIT AND SETS OFF IN CELEBRATION 
EVERTON GET THE BREAK THROUGH 
THERE IS A HUGE SLICE OF LUCK 
ATTACHED TO IT NEVILLE CHARGED ON 
TO THIS ONE THOUGHT IN HIS MIND 
HE HIT IT HARD AND HE HIT IT INTO 
LAURSEN INTO THE NET IT WENT 
CARSON SENT THE WRONG WAY BY HIS 
OWN PLAYER DOESN'T MATTER HOW THEY 
GO IN IN A GAME THAT MATTERS THIS 
MUCH EVER TON ONE FOOT PLACED 
TOWARDS THAT UEFA CUP PLACE AGAIN 
NEXT SEASON HE PULLED AT THE SHOT THERE THE 
WAY NEVILLE CELEBRATED YOU TRY 
TAKING IT OFF HIM MARTIN O'NEILL'S 
MEN LOOK AS THOUGH THEY WILL HAVE 
TO SETTLE FOR THE LOTTERY OF THE 
INTERTOTO CUP THEY WON'T HAVE 
GIVEN UP ON THIS YET NOT BY A LONG 
STRETCH THEY HAVE A CORNER VILLA 
ARE ONE OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE'S 
COME BACK EXPERTS THIS SEASON AND 
HAVE CLAIMED SEVENTEEN POINTS FROM BEING 
BEHIND THIS SEASON YOUNG'S CORNER WAS FLICKED ON A AND 
HE HAS TO TOUCH IT OVER THE CROSS 
BAR CARSLEY CAUSED THE PROBLEM IN 
HIS OWN PENALTY AREA THERE HOWARD SOMEHOW KEEPS IT OUT THERE 
IS A MAN ON THE GOALLINE TOO HE 
HAD ENOUGH PROTECTION FROM THE 
BLUE SHIRTED BODIES AROUND HIM 
NOTHING BETWEEN THE TWO TEAMS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE 
PREVIOUS LEAGUE MEETINGS SEVENTY WINS 
EACH CARSON HAS NOT GOT IT AND IT IS A CORNER CARSON HAS 
TO FLY THROUGH THE AIR TO TOUCH IT BEHIND DECEPTIVE BALL 
PLAYED IN VILLA A LITTLE ASLEEP AT 
THE BACK A GOOD JOB CARSON WAS 
SWITCHED ON ULTIMATELY TWO VILLA PLAYERS WENT FOR IT VILLA LOOK AS THOUGH THEY ARE STEPPING IT UP A LITTLE BIT LESS COT TOUCHES IT BEHIND IT IS A CORNER A PROBLEM FOR HIM TOO MELLBERG LOOKING FOR IT AND 
AGBONLAHOR ASTON VILLA ARE LEVEL 
GABRIEL AGBONLAHOR JUST LOVES 
FACING EVERTON MELLBERG TRIED TO 
HELP IT ON AGBONLAHOR LURKING 
AROUND THE BACK OF EVERYBODY WHAT 
A GREAT FINISH POKES OUT A BOOT 
POKES IT PAST HOWARD AND NOW WE 
SHOULD BE SET FOR A FRANTIC FIN 
ALLAY YOBO FIRES IT INTO THE ROOF OF THE 
NET IN NO MOOD TO 
CELEBRATE THIS TIME NOW IT IS THE 
TIME FOR FULL CONCENTRATION 
EVERTON CAN'T LET IT SLIP AGAIN 
LOOK AT CARSLEY HOLDING BACK FOUND 
AGAIN BY ARTETA NOT QUESTION OF 
OFFSIDE AND IN COMES YOBO FIRST 
TIME ROOF OF THE NET ON THE 
VOLLEY TWO ONE EVERTON WOULD ROW 
BELIEVE IT IT HAS TURNED AROUND 
AGAIN WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT IT 
HAS TURNED AROUND AGAIN CAREW IT IS TURNED IN THIS IS 
INCREDIBLE I THINK IT MIGHT BE AN 
OWN GOAL THAT WAS STRAIGHT FROM 
THE RESTART CAREW WENT UP WITH 
LESCOTT WHO APPLIED THE TOUCH IT 
IS CAREW FOUR GOALS IN HIS LAST 
THREE GAMES TWICE EVERTON HAVE LED 
TWICE ASTON VILLA HAVE STORMED BACK 
INTO THE GAME I THINK HE HAS SUMMED UP THE 
FEELINGS OF EVERY EVERTONIAN THAT 
WILL RUN FOR AN EVERTON CORNER YOBO HAAR CARSON GOT DOWN ON 
HIS POST DID HE CLEAR IT OR WAS 
IT BLOCKED BY PETROVSOME IS THERE ONE LAST EVERTON CHANCE 
HERE NO ALL OVER WHAT A TERRIFIC 
SECOND HALF EVERTON SURELY THOUGHT 
THEY HAD WON THE GAME TWICE THANKS 
TO NEVILLE'S DEFLECTED SHOT AND 
YOBO'S VOLLEY BUT TWICE PACK CAME 
ASTON VILLA GABRIEL AGBONLAHOR AND 
JOHN CAREW HONOURS EVEN AND IT IS 
STILL JUST ADVANTAGE EVERTON IN THE 
BATTLE FOR FIFTH 
I'M DISAPPOINTED WE CONCEDED A GOAL 
SO QUICKLY SO DISAPPOINTED WE 
COULD NOT HANG ON BUT IT WAS A 
GOOD GAME TWO TEAMS GOING FOR IT 
ASTON VILLA ARE IN GOOD FORM IT 
WAS A HARD GAME 
EIGHTEEN POINTS GAINED 
FROM LOSING POSS LOU DO DO YOU DO 
IT 
WE HAVE SCORED MORE GOALS THAN IT ANYONE ELSE AWAY FROM HOME WE ARE 
THE SECOND TOP GOAL CONSERVATIVEERS 
THAT IS A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT 
GOAL SCORERS AND THAT IS THE 
REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT THEY HAVE 
HAD GREAT DETERMINATION WE ARE 
CAPABLE OF SCORING AND WE CAN 
FASHION GOALS FROM LOTS OF 
POSITIONS AND WE NEVER GIVE UP TO 
BE HONEST I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY 
EPITOMISEDOUS F. R. US 
HAVE A 
LOT TO PLAY FOR 
IT IS GOOD FOR THE TEAM AND ME I 
HOPE WE NOW CAN FINISH IT OFF 
PERFECTLY AND GRAB THAT FIFTH PLACE 
THERE WAS FRESHNESS TODAY THE 
ATMOSPHERE WAS FANTASTIC THE TWO 
TEAMS BOTH WANTED TO WIN AND IT WAS 
A GREAT GAME TO PLAY AND THE 
CONDITIONS HELPED IT PROBABLY WAS 
A GOOD ADVERT FOR ENGLISH FOOTBALL 
WHICH IS THE FIFTH BEST TEAM IN 
ENGLISH FOOTBALL WHO IS THE BETTER 
IF OF THESE TWO THERE IS 
NOT A 
LOT BETWEEN THEM EVERTON ARE ON A 
POOR RUN ONE WIN IN SEVEN VILLA 
THE WAY THEY HAVE ENDED THIS SEASON 
HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC THEY ARE 
SCORING GOALS FROM ALL OVER THE 
PITCH THERE ARE THREE POINTS 
BETWEEN THEM BUT BY THE END OF THE 
SEASON YOU CANNOT PICK BETWEEN 
THEM IT WAS A FABULOUS GAME TODAY 
AND PHIL NEVILLE WAS RIGHT IT WAS 
AN ADVERT FOR ENGLISH FOOTBALL 
DOES JUST WILL HELP 
YEAH THE 
SLIDING TACKLES ARE BETTER 
DRIZZLE ONCE THE SECOND HALF 
STARTED EVERYONE WAS INTO IT A A WHAT WAS THE DAVID MOYES MASTER 
PLAN 
IF YOU HAVE BEEN TWICE IN PLAN FRONT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO WIN THE 
GAME UP HE KNOWS THAT A WIN AT 
HOME IT SHOULD SECURE THEM A 
EUROPEAN SPORT SPOT SO HOW 
HE WIN AGAINST A VILLA SIDE WITH 
MOMENTUM WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY SCORED 
FIFTEEN GOALS IN THE THREE GAMES BEFORE 
HE SET OUT TO SUBDUE THE VILLA 
THREAT FROM THE START THE FULCRUM 
OF THE ATTACK THE PACE AND AT THE 
FLAT THE FULCRUM OF THE ATTACKER 
ATTACK IS SO OFTEN CAREW SEE HIM 
CIRCLED HERE WATCH THE EVERTON 
PLAYERS SURROUND HIM AND WATCH THEM 
CLOSE HIM DOWN THERE'S OSMAN NOW 
CARSLEY NOW ON THE BALL AND THEY 
STEAL IT AWAY THEN WHEN THE BALL 
IS KNOCKED LONG HE IS A CHALLENGE 
BY GABO AND HERE IS A YELLOW CARD 
NEXT THE PACE BECAUSE EVERTON 
DEFENDED SO DEEP THERE IS NOT 
THE 
SPACE FOR HIM TO SPIN OFF WATCH 
THE BALL BEING KNOCKED ACROSS THE 
MID FIELD AREA NOW HE NEEDS THE 
NICK BEALE TO STOP THE BALL COMING 
THROUGH LE BON THE HALL EVENTUALLY IT COMES AND AGAIN THE 
DANGER IS SNUFFED OUT THEN YOU 
HAVE THE FLAIR AND ASHLEY YOUNG 
HAS BEEN SENSATIONAL THIS SEASON 
WHEN HE GETS THE BALL THERE IS 
ALWAYS DANGER LOOK AT JONSSON 
TRACK BACK HERE FORCED HIM TO 
CHECK AND PLAY IT INTO A LESS 
DANGEROUS AREA AS HE GOES OUT TO 
YOUNG YOU WATCH CARSLEY AND 
NEVILLE DOUBLE TEAM HIM THEY GET 
TOGETHER ON HIM HE IS FORCED TO 
GET BETWEEN THEM HE IS CHECKING 
AND TRIES SOMETHING AND HE HAS TO 
KNOCK IT TOO FAR THEY DID THAT TO 
FAR IT REALLY WELL 
WHAT WAS THE MORE POSITIVE 
ATTACKING PLAN 
WHEN YOU ARE 
PLAYING VILLA THEY ARE PLAYING 
NARROW IN MIDFIELD WITH PETROV AND 
REO COKER REALLY NARROW IT EXPOSES 
THEIR FULL BACKS TO ME YOU NEED 
TO PUSH THE FULL BAGS ON YOUR OWN 
FULL BACKS PLAYED TWO VERSES ONE UP 
WE PICKED UP THE MIDFIELD PLAYERS 
MELLBERG HAS TO COME OUT HE HAS 
COME OUT OF 
HIS POSITION BECAUSE 
THERE IS NO COVER HE DOES NOT HAVE 
THE SAFETY VALVE AGAIN THREE 
MIDFIELD PLAYERS ARE REALLY NARROW 
WHERE ARE SO SPACE ON THE LEFT 
HAND SIDE MELLBERG COMES OVER 
AGAIN EVENTUALLY WINS IT NOW YOU 
NEED OVERLAPS HERE COMES LESCOTT 
ON THE LEFT WING WHIPS A GREAT 
BALL IN HERE HE IS AGAIN LOOK AT 
BOUMA CREATE THE SPACE BEHIND THERE IS 
YOUR FALL BACK ON YOUR OVERLAP 
CREATES THE SPACE AGAIN THE SPACE 
IS IN FRONT OF MELLBERG NO 
COVERING MIDFIELD PLAY IN FRONT OF 
HIM SO THE SPACE IS THERE THEY 
CAN PLAY IT POP IT OFF THEY END 
UP GETTING IN DOWN THAT LEFT HAND 
SIDE AND WATCH THE THREE MIDFIELD 
PLAYERS HOW NARROW THEY ARE UP AND 
WHERE IS THE SPACE WHEN THEY BREAK 
THERE THEY ARE AGAIN THE SPACES ON 
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PITCH ARTETA 
BREAKS HE NEEDS HELP WHO IS 
HELPING HIM IT IS NEVILLE THIS IS 
THE GOAL GET YOUR FULL BAGS 
FORWARD TRY TO SUPPORT WHO IS 
COMING UP GARY 
NEVILLE HITS 
COMING UP GARY NEVILLE HITS LARSSON IF YOU ARE GOING TO HIT 
THE VILLA YOU HAVE TO ATTACK THEIR 
FULL BAGS 
GREAT COMEBACK 
THEY ARE 
A GOOD SIDE AND THEY HAVE SHOWN 
GREAT FLAIR BUT TODAY THEY SHOWED 
GREAT CHARACTER AND THEY CAME BACK 
TWICE 
BOUNCE BACK ABILITY THOSE TWICE THOSE PLAYERS WHO ARE SUBDUED YOU ONLY 
NEED TO GIVE THEM HALF CHANCE 
WATCH AGBONLAHOR LOVELY FINISH 
THEN THE SECOND GOAL IS OFTEN 
OBVIOUSLY CAREW WATCH AS IT IS 
PLAYED BACK 
TO BARRY WATCH HERE AS HE PUSHES AWAY JUST TO GET BIT OF SPACE NOW HE IS 
BETWEEN DEFENDERS A BIT MORE 
STRENGTH AND HE HAS KNOCKED LESCOTT 
OUT THE WAY 
HE WILL NOT MISS FROM 
OUT THE WAY HE WILL NOT MISS FROM THERE THEY TOOK CARE OF THEM FOR 
THE LARGE PROPORTION OF THE GAME 
BUT THEY DID NOT NEED MUCH 
WE WERE 
SEE THOSE TWO GOALS 
BUT THEY DID NOT NEED MUCH WE WERE SEE THOSE TWO GOALS 
AGAIN FOR MY 
DEFENSIVE POINT OF VIEW 
HAVE DONE FANTASTIC DEFENSIVELY 
CARSLEY HIS JOB IS TO STOP ANYONE 
GETTING IN FRONT LESCOTT IS TIED 
ON CAREW BUT HE GETS ABOUT FOURTEEN A 
LITTLE FLICK ON AND LE BON THE 
HAWK HE DOES NOT LET HIM IN ONCE HE 
CROSSES THE BALL IN FROM THERE THE 
BACK FOUR IS NOT IN A BAD POSITION 
WHEN A BALL COMES IN FROM THAT 
ANGLE ADRIAN WITH THAT RIPPED IT 
IS HARD TO DEFEND AGAINST EVERTON 
HAVE BEEN SOLID ALL SEASON BUT 
GAVE AWAY A COUPLE OF WEAK GOALS 
COVERAGE OF THE WORLD SNOOKER 
CHAMPIONSHIP CONTINUES ON B. B. C. TWO 
LATER TONIGHT THERE'S HIGHLIGHTS 
OF THE DAY'S PLAY AT TWENTY FIVE PAST 
MIDNIGHT 
STILL TO COME HIGHLIGHTS OF 
TODAY'S OTHER GAME PORTSMOUTH 
VERSUS BLACKBURN 
ANOTHER LOOK AT THE W. W. F. WRESTLING 
AT STAMFORD BRIDGE AND BIRMINGHAM 
FANS TUNED IN FOR NEWS OF BOLTON 
DRAWING FULHAM WINNING OR EVEN 
WORSE 
THAT IS A IN CASE MY WIFE FINDS 
PORTSMOUTH VERSUS BLACKBURN BOTH 
OF THESE TWO STILL HAD A FAINT 
CHANCE OF UEFA CUP PLACE BUT 
POMPEY HAVE ANOTHER CUP ON THEIR 
MINDS STILL IF LAST SUNDAY'S 
PERFORMANCE IS ANYTHING TO GO BY 
WE WOULDN'T GO SHORT OF 
ENTERTAINMENT TODAY 
THINK OF A WORD TO DESCRIBE 
PORTSMOUTH'S DEFENDING AT MAN CITY 
LAST WEEKEND HOW ABOUT SLAPSTICK 
HARRY ENJOYED IT RATHER LESS THAN 
SPEND DAVID JAMES'S BLACKBURN 
COUNTERPART ENJOYED A MUCH BETTER 
WEEKEND TEVEZ STRIKE FINALLY 
BEAT HIM DAVID JAMES MRS. A LEAGUE GAME FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN FOUR ONE QUARTER YEARS A 
CALF INJURY ENDS HIS RUN OF 
CONSECUTIVE MATCHES AT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX ASHDOWN 
REPLACES HIM BLACKBURN ARE 
UNCHANGED AS THEY LOOK FOR THEIR 
SECOND WIN HERE THIS SEASON PEDERSEN IS THERE AND IT WAS A 
WHISKER AWAY FROM SCORING ASHDOWN 
DID NOT GET THERE FIRST NOW THE 
MOMENT FOR THE STAND IN FOR DAVID 
JAMES NAVVY JERMAIN DEFOE VERY NEARLY PROVED 
THE POINT THERE HE HAS LOOKED VERY 
VERY SHARP HE HAD BRAD FRIEDEL 
SCRAMBLING TO HIS LEFT DEFOE AGAIN HE GOES CLOSE BUT AS 
THE BALL'S PLAYED IN SUGGESTIONS 
OF OFFSIDE BUT IT BREAKS THROUGH 
AN DEFOE IS IN THERE NOT MUCH 
CLOSER THAN THAT WITHOUT FINDING 
THE BACK OF THE NET GOOD PLAY BY 
ROBERTS SAVED BY ASHDOWN JAMIE 
ASHDOWN HAS HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN 
THE FIRST HALF BUT HE DEALT THAT 
IS PRETTY WELL FROM JASON ROBERTS RISING DRIVE FROM THE BLACKBURN ROVERS STRIKER HE WILL SETTLE FOR A CORNER SAMBA AND NELSON LURKING AT THE FAR POST SAMBA WAS NEARLY IN THERE THAT WAS A TERRIFIC RUN AND BEHIND IT GOES BENTLEY CAUSED 
MAYHEM HERE LOVELY FLICK INTO THE 
CENTRE AND THERE WAS A GREAT SAVE 
BY ASHDOWN A LITTLE FLICK FROM JASON SANTA CRUZ WAS HE FOULED I THINK CAMPBELL 
FOULS ROBERTS THERE JUST OUTSIDE 
THE PENALTY AREA AND BLACKBURN 
SHOULD HAVE HAD A FREE KICK OH AND IT WAS SO CLOSE TO THE 
OPENING GOAL THERE FOR PORTSMOUTH 
SO SO CLOSE MUNTARI AT THE FAR 
POST THAT VERY NEARLY TURNED IT IN 
DEFOE HEADING IN AT THE NEAR POST 
PORTSMOUTH ALREADY WITH A JAWS AT 
HOME IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE THIS 
SEASON EIGHT DRAWS AT THE 
MOMENT HEADING FOR ANOTHER ONE 
SAVED BY FRIEDEL WHO HAS HAD 
MUCH QUIETER AFTERNOON THAN HE DID 
LAST WEEKEND AGAINST MANCHESTER 
UNITED POSSESSION GIVEN AWAY BY BLACKBURN ROVERS IN THE END AND NO DAMAGE DONE SANTA CRUZ AND HE PUT BLACKBURN 
AHEAD AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED 
LAST WEEK AND HE HAS DONE A HERE AT 
PORTSMOUTH TODAY SANTA CRUZ GOAL 
NUMBER TWENTY ONE FOR THE SEASON AND 
BLACKBURN ROVERS HAVE THE LEAD 
WITH JUST OVER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR 
TO PLAY PORTSMOUTH'S DEFENDERS 
WERE INNOCENT LITTLE OF THE PACE AWAY COMES EVERTON SANTA CRUZ NEARLY GOT HOLD OF IT BUT IT IS CLEARED NO PENALTY SAYS MIKE RILEY I DO NOT THINK THAT IS A PENALTY 
DISAPPOINTING FOR PORTSMOUTH IT 
THEY CAN'T GET ANYTHING FROM THIS 
MATCH AGAINST MARK HUGHES'S TEAM IT BRAD FRIEDEL NEARLY GOT HIMSELF 
INTO ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE THERE HE 
WAS CAUGHT IN ABOUT SIX NEVER MIND 
TO VERY NEARLY PAID THE PRICE 
THIS IS BRILLIANT A FREE KICK IT'S GONNA BE A YELLOW 
CARD AS WELL FOR BLACKBURN ROVERS 
LEFT BACK THIS COULD BE THE CHANCE FOR 
PORTSMOUTH IF THEY ARE GONNA GET 
BACK IN THIS GAME THE FOUR HEADER SAVED BY FRIEDEL HE 
KEPT HIS CONCENTRATION WHEN IT WAS 
REQUIRED 
KEPT HIS CONCENTRATION WHEN IT WAS REQUIRED 
WE DESERVED THE WIN THE REQUIRED SECOND HALF PERFORMANCE ENABLED US 
TO GET OVER THE LINE AND WE HAVE 
GOT TWO GAMES LEFT DERBY AND 
BIRMINGHAM TWO DIFFICULT GAMES 
BUT GAMES THAT WE FEEL WE CAN GET 
MAXIMUM POINTS FROM AND IF WE DO 
WE WILL GET SIXTY POINTS THAT MAY BE 
ENOUGH FOR INTERTOTO 
DISA POINTED 
WE COULD NOT SELL OUT HERE TODAY L. 
FOUND THAT STRANGE GOING SO WELL 
LOOKING AT THE TOP FIVE IN THE 
LEAGUE AND CUP FINAL TO COME IT 
WAS A. LACKED SOME ATMOSPHERE 
THAT END HALF EMPTY FOR A 
PREMIER LEAGUE GAME YOU DON'T 
EXPECT THAT 
HE IS BLAMING THE 
CROWD THAT ISN'T FAIR WHAT DID 
YOU MAKE OF IT 
IT WAS A POOR GAME 
THERE WAS A LACK OF URGENCY 
NEITHER TEAM PLAYED GREAT BUT 
BLACKBURN GOT THE WIN AND IN SANTA 
CRUZ HE IS ONE OF THE BUYS OF THE 
SEASON THREE POINT FIVE MILLION AND TWENTY ONE GOALS 
MAYBE PORTSMOUTH HAD HALF AN EYE ON 
THE CUP FINAL 
YOU HAD THAT 
SITUATION CHELSEA GOT STUFFED BY 
MANCHESTER UNITED 
WE WEREN'T GOING 
TO DO ANYTHING ON WIN THE LEAGUE 
DO YOU THINK THEY HAD THE CUP FINAL 
IN THEIR HEADS 
THEY HAVE DECISIONS 
TO MAKE DEFOE CAN'T FLAY 
IN THE 
TO MAKE DEFOE CAN'T FLAY IN THE FINAL PLAY IN THE FINAL KANU'S 
PLAY WAS GREAT DEFOE TRYING TO GET 
HELP FROM DEEP HE HAS CHANGED HIS 
POSITION BUT AGAIN KANU HOLDS IT 
UP AND THEY PLAY A ONE TWO BUT 
THEY HAVE NOT GOT THAT OPTION IN 
THE FINAL THIS IS WHAT HE CAN 
BRING HE DROPS THE BALL DEEP LOOK 
AT HOW FAR UP THE PITCH IS DEFOE 
THIS IS WHAT THEY WILL MISS HE 
ATTACKS THE GOAL AND WHEN HE GETS A 
CHANCE HE CUTS INSIDE HE WANTS TO 
SCORE A LINK UP WITH A BIT LUCKY 
WHEN IT BOUNCES TO HIM BUT HE HAS 
GOT AN EYE FOR GOAL AND PERHAPS HE 
SHOULD HAVE GOT A COUPLE TODAY BUT 
THEY HAVE ANOTHER DECISION JAMES 
BEING INJURED JAMIE ASHDOWN WILL 
HE PLAY IN THE FINAL HE HAS A FLAP 
AT THE CROSS L. HE 
WHEN HE 
HAD TO MAKE A SAVE HE MADE A GOOD 
SAVE YOU WOULD SAY HE SHOULD SAVE 
IT THIS IS PROBABLY A BETTER ONE 
HE GETS A GOOD HAND ON IT THIS THE 
BEST SAVE FOR LAST NELSEN WITH THE 
HEADER AND WHAT A SAVE THAT IS L. 
BELIEVE JAMES' CALF HE HAS A 
SLIGHT TEAR TWO TO THREE WEEKS HE 
MAY NOT MAKE THE FINAL 
IT IS CANOE 
I THOUGHT IT WAS KANU 
HEN YOU KNOW 
HIM IT IS CANOE 
WILL WILL MAKE IT EVER ONOR VILLA 
EVERTON HAVE THE FAVOURITE BUT 
THEY 
HAVE THE HARDER GAMES VILLA VILLA HAVE GOT THE EASIER GAMES NOW NOW YESTERDAY'S GOALS STARTING WITH 
THAT DUST UP AT STAMFORD BRIDGE 
YOU KNOW THINGS ARE GETTING SERIOUS 
WHEN THE COMPETENCE OF THE GREAT 
SIR ALEX IS CALLED INTO QUESTION 
YESTERDAY IT WAS A LESS IMMINENT 
MANAGER WHO MAY AFTER ALL KNOW WHAT 
HE IS DOING VIDIC HAS HAD BETTER 
WEEKS MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS SAY 
THAT A KNEE IN THE HEAD BY DROGBA 
IS LIABLE TO LED TO YOU BEING 
UNCONSCIOUS AND BLOOD BEING DRAWN CHELSEA HAVE STAKED A REAL CLAIM FOR THE LEAGUE TITLE WITH THAT GOAL ROONEY SCORES WAYNE ROONEY MOMENTS 
AGO LOOKED IN PAIN AND IN TROUBLE 
AND AS IF HE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO COME 
OFF HE IS CLEARLY DISTRESSED BUT 
HE HAS SCORED THE GOAL THAT MUTTS 
PUTS MANCHESTER UNITED BACK IN 
THE DRIVING SEAT ROONEY WAS 
REPLACED BY RONALDO WHO SOON GOT 
INTO THE SWING OF TWHIS A BIT OF 
W. W. F. A BIT OF GRID IRON IN THERE 
TOO IT WAS NOT RESTRICTED TO DUST 
UP BETWEEN PLAYERS OF OPPOSING 
TEAMS IN A SCENE PLAYED OUT IN 
PLAYGROUNDS BALLACK AND DROGBA 
SQUABBLE OVER WHO WILL TAKE THE 
KICK THE FREE KICK NEEDLESS 
TO SAY CAME TO NOTHING SO THEY PRESSED ON WITH 
THE BICKERING DROGBA INTENT ON 
FALLING OUT WITH EVERYONE HERE IS 
THE HAND BALL YES IT IS SURELY 
HAND BALL A GERMAN TOOK THE 
PENALTY AND WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS 
WHEN GERMANS TAKE PENALTIES 
BALLACK RESTORES CHELSEA LEAD TWO TO ONE 
AND THE ARGUMENTS WILL RAGE CARRICK ARRIVING WAS HE FOULED 
RONALDO OFF THE LINE BY COLE COULD 
HE GET MORE DRAMATIC THAN THIS 
THIS IS FLETCHER OFF THE LINE 
AGAIN WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT IT IS 
A FREE KICK TO CHELSEA FOR THE 
CHALLENGE BY FERDINAND AND TETCHERS 
NOW RISE TEMPERS NOW RISE ON 
THE FINAL WHISTLE LOVE BLOSSOMED 
ANEW BUT REO LOOKED AS IF HE WAS 
GOING TO KICK A WALL OR A STEWARD 
IF SHE HAPPENED TO GET IN THE WAY 
IN KEEPING WITH THE FEELING THERE 
WAS A BRAWL IN THE WARM DOWN 
IN KEEPING WITH THE FEELING THERE WAS A BRAWL IN THE WARM DOWN 
SHOULD WE DO SOME TUT TUTTING 
ABOUT THAT OR SAY WHAT WE HAVE 
BELIEVE WHICH IS THRILLING FUNNY 
THE PICTURE I SAW OF THE FUNNY GROUNDSMAN HE LOOKED A BIT BIG LAD 
I KNOW THOSE GROUNDSMEN L. WOULD BE CAREFUL 
IT SHOWS HOW TENSE IT IS CAREFUL GETTING FERDINAND HE IS A BRIGHT 
GUY HE HAS SENT SOME FLOWERS TO 
POOR LADY HE ACCIDENTALLY 
WELL HE 
APOLOGISED LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW 
I THINK 
MANCHESTER UNITED WITH THE HOME 
GAME WITH WEST HAM AND WIGAN YOU 
GIVE ALEX FERGUSON AT THE START OF 
SEASON TO WIN THE LEAGUE HE WOULD 
TAKE IT SO STILL ADVANTAGE UNITED 
UNITED WERE DEALT PSYCHOLOGICAL 
BLOW FROM CHELSEA THEY HAVE COME 
FROM NOWHERE BUT YOU STILL MUST 
FANCY UNITED 
WE HAVE SEEN THE 
DRAMA AT THE TOP THERE WAS PLENTY 
AT THE BOTTOM TOO FULHAM FANS HAVE WAITED ALL SEASON 
FOR KAMARA TO SHOW HE IS WORTH THE 
SIX MILLION THEY HAD PAID FOR HIM 
FULHAM STILL FIVE POINTS FROM 
SAFETY HE HAS GONE FOR PLACEMENTMENT WHAT 
A GOAL WHAT A BRILLIANT BRILLIANT 
GOAL BY STEVEN IRELAND IT IS A 
DAGGER TO THE HEART OF FULHAM BENJANI KAMARA IT HAS GONE IN THROUGH THE 
LEGS OF THE KEEPER AND SUDDENLY IT 
ALL CHANGES OH IT IS A PENALTY TO FULHAM HE SAVED IT BUT HE DOES NOT SAVE 
THE FOLLOW UP AND IT IS TWO TO TWO AND 
FROM NOTHING FULHAM ARE IN THE 
MATCH KAMARA HE STORED A WONDERFUL 
WONDERFUL GOAL FOR FULHAM THEY ARE 
GOING TO TAKE ALL THREE POINTS AND 
THE GREAT ESCAPE FOR ROY HODGSON'S 
FULHAM IS ON DESPERATE AS BOLTON 
ARE FOR POINTS THEIR BOSS SAW THIS 
AS ONE GAINED RATHER THAN TWO LOST 
IF I WAS MEGSON I WOULD CLAIM 
CREDIT FOR A DOUBLE SUBSTITUTION 
ON CAME DIOUF AND STELIOS FOR THE 
SECOND HALF A BRILLIANT MOVE AS IT 
TURNED OUT LOOK AT STELIOS RUNNING 
HIS GREEK LEGS OFF FROM THE KICK 
OFF DIOUF PLAYS IN THE BUILD UP 
AND FINDS STELIOS TO SCRABBLE IT IN 
BUT THE LEAD LASTED ALL OF SIX 
MINUTES KEAN PLAYING CANNON OFF 
THE DEFENDER'S LEG INTO THE PATH OF 
MALBRANQUE BUT IT COULD BE WORSE 
BERBATOV MISSING A GREAT CHANCE AT 
THE DEATH IT HAS NOW BEEN FIVE GAMES AND 
SEVEN HOURS FORTY ONE MINUTES SINCE THEY 
LAST BUT THE BALL IN THE NET 
READING READING CLEAR IT TO SAFETY MARKUS 
BENT WITH THE HEADER WHAT CAN 
HARPER DO HERE 
RIGHT GOAL FROM LEE ROY LITA HE ALMOST SQUEEZED IT IN 
ANOTHER GAME BEARING ON RELEGATION 
FIGHT THEY USED TO SAY IF KATE 
ADIE TURNED UP IN DOUBLE THE SAME 
IS TRUE OF KEVIN DAY SO FAR 
IMMATURITY OF MISERY I HAVE BROUGHT 
GOOD LUCK TO BOLTON SADLY I ALL 
BUT RELEGATED FULHAM TODAY MY 
FICKLE FINGER OF FATE POINTS 
TOWARDS BIRMINGHAM 
IN OUR QUEST FOR THE SECRET OF 
PREMIERSHIP SURVIVAL THE THREE KEY 
LIST LESSONS ARE HAVE FAITH IN 
YOUR MANAGER 
WHAT BRITS HAS DONE 
FOR WIGAN HE COULD HAVE DONE FOR 
BIRMINGHAM 
BE LUCKY 
WE LOST ONE TO ZERO BIRMINGHAM AT MANCHESTER UNITED HOME AND AWAY 
BUILD AND BUY CHELSEA AND BEATEN ONE 
ZERO HERE 
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT 
BIRMINGHAM CITY HAVE TICKED NONE OF 
THOSE BOXES ALEX MCLEISH HAS GONE 
FOR A FORK STRATEGY GIVE YOURSELF 
AN ARGENTINIAN STRIKER ON LOAN MASERATI 
HE IS A FLAIR PLAYER SO MASERATI SO RATTY 
IS IT A BIT UNFAIR A BIT UNFAIR 
UNSPORTING 
NO I DON'T MIND UNSPORTING I UNDERSTAND YOU YOU HAVE A REASON 
WHY BIRMINGHAM NEED TO WIN TODAY 
WHY IS THAT 
BECAUSE IT IS MY 
BIRTHDAY 
WHO WILL WIN 
BLUES FIVE TO ZERO BIRTHDAY IF IT IS A WILL MEET YOU AFTERWARDS 
AND GIDDY TEN POUNDS AS A BURNING IT 
BOTH A TREE IF IT ISN'T YOU HAVE 
TO GIVE THE TEN 
IT MEANS THERE ARE THREE TEAMS 
SEPARATED BY ONE POINT TO MAKE 
THINGS EVEN MORE INTERESTING AND 
RETRO THEY WILL KICK OFF AT THREE P. M. 
TODAY SO FOR BIRMINGHAM FANS EYES 
PITCH IS 
ON THE RADIO AND 
HARD CINEMA IT WAS NOT LIVEABLE'S 
UNDER ELEVENTH BUT MANY CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE PLAYERS WERE SIDE LIGHTED 
SIDELINED TINY RUMP RADIOS 
CRACKLED EVERYWHERE OF NEWS OF 
REDDING FULHAM AND BOLTON 
VASSELL PUT BIRMINGHAM IN FRONT 
BETTER NEWS FOR BIRMINGHAM BECAUSE 
FULHAM ARE LOSING 
THAT IS BAD NEWS TO START THE 
SECOND HALF WITH FOUR BIRMINGHAM 
BOLTON HAVE JUST TAKEN THE LEAD AT 
TOTTENHAM HE HAS GONE A BIT QUIET 
SO I SUPPOSE THEY HAVE HEARD THAT 
AS I THINK THIS STANDS FULHAM WILL 
BE RELEGATED TODAY HERE COMES LARSEN AND SCORES 
IT IS TOTTENHAM ONE BOLTON ONE AS 
BIRMINGHAM THINGS STAND 
BIRMINGHAM WILL BE OUT OF THE 
BOTTOM THREE THEN AN OLD FRIEND TURNED THE MATCH ALMOST ON HIS OWN LIVERPOOL ARE IN IT AND EVERY BLUES FAN FANS KNEW 
WHAT WAS COMING NEXT TEXTBOOK 
RELEGATION BEHAVIOUR IT'S IN WITH A DEFLECTION IT IS TWO 
TWO HERE WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT 
BIRMINGHAM LOOKED INCREASINGLY 
DESPERATE DESPERATE SUDDENLY THE FINAL WHISTLE COULD 
NOT COME SOON ENOUGH A LEFT 
BIRMINGHAM READING IN THE BOTTOM 
THREE AND AT THE THEM ONE AT 
FRICK THREE TO TWO UNBELIEVABLE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH A DRAW 
AT THE START OF THE GAME BUT AT 
THE END OF THE BEST OF WE THOUGHT 
WE WOULD DO IT 
WHEN YOU ARE TWO TO ZERO UP 
IT IS A KEY COMMITTEE 
IT WAS GOING 
TO BE A KICK IN SOMETHING ELSE 
THEN IT WAS A BAD RESULT 
GOALS NO FROM YESTERDAY'S OTHER TWO 
GAMES AT THE STADIUM OF LIGHT THE 
PLAUDITS YESTERDAY IT WENT TO AN 
IRISHMAN CALLED MURPHY IT IS 
ANOTHER IRISHMAN WHO DESERVES A 
CREDIT FOR FANTASTIC SEASON AT SUNDERLAND BEATEN BY TUNCAY DANGERS CROSS BRAD JONES WITH THE HALF PUNCHED CLEAR THE HEADER IS IN WHAT A 
MAGNIFICENT RESPONSE DANNY 
HIGGINBOTHAM NORTH SUNDERLAND IT'S IN EL THE SCORES ALVIS SCORES THE SUBSTITUTE STRIKES AND 
SUNDERLAND ARE SAFE CLEARLY OVER 
THE LINE AS IT CAME DOWN OFF THE 
BAR AND SUNDERLAND ARE STAYING IN 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE WEST HAM WERE THE BETTER SIDE BUT 
NEWCASTLE SOMEHOW MANAGED TO SHARE 
THE POINTS KEEGAN SAID I WOULD 
RATHER BE A LUCKY MANAGER THAN GOOD ONE GOOD EFFORT BUT GOT WONDERFUL STRIKE BY MARK NOBLE TWO TO ZERO OH FANTASTIC TWO TO ONE NEWCASTLE BACK IN IT 
IT'S IN IT'S TO DO TO TWO TO TWO 
THE GAME MIGHT HAVE COME OFF 
MCCARTNEY ARE LAST OF ALL IT LOOKS LIKE GOING TO THE FINAL 
SUNDAY THIS SEASON EVERTON ARE IN 
POLE POSITION PORTSMOUTH'S HOPES 
ALL BUT DISAPPEARED WITH THEIR 
DEFEAT AT BLACKBURN 
WHO WILL GO DOWN THEN IT ALL COME 
DOWN TO THE GAME BETWEEN BIRMINGHAM 
AND FULHAM 
I PICK IT WILL BE A 
DRAW FULHAM WILL GET SOMETHING 
AGAINST PORTSMOUTH THE WAY THEY 
PLAYED TODAY 
IT WILL BE DERBY 
BIRMINGHAM AND BOLTON MY BOLTON MY OPINION IS IT WILL STAY AS IT IS 
READING HAVE COUPLE OF DECENT
