GOOD EVENING THERE'S STILL NO SIGN OF ANY WARM OR PROLONGED DRY SPELL 
SO ONCE AGAIN WEDNESDAY WILL GREET US WITH MORE SUNSHINE 
BUT ALSO SOME SHOWERS HOPEFULLY THERE'LL BE FEWER THAN WE'VE HAD 
DURING MONDAY AND TUESDAY HERE'S WHY 
THIS IS THE AREA OF CLOUD THAT BROUGHT THE SHOWERS ON TUESDAY 
ACROSS MANY AREAS THEY'VE KEPT GOING THROUGH THE NIGHT 
AND WILL CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS 
INTO THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING BUT EVENTUALLY WILL EASE AWAY 
THE SKIES HAVE BEEN CLEARING FURTHER WEST 
TEMPERATURES ARE DOWN AND HERE WE'LL HAVE WIDESPREAD FROST 
BUT IN EASTERN AREAS WHERE WE KEEP MORE CLOUD LOW CLOUD ALBEIT 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD HOLD ABOVE FREEZING 
BUT UNDER THE CLEAR SKIES FURTHER WEST NOT JUST FROST BUT MAYBE FOG 
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG TO CLEAR 
SHOULD BE A GLORIOUS DAY FOR PARTS OF WALES WITH MORE SUNSHINE THAN TODAY 
IF NORTHERN IRELAND SEES CLOUD IT'S LIKELY TO BE EASTERN COASTAL COUNTIES 
BUT THE WEST HAS PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AS WE'LL SEE FOR SCOTLAND 
IT COULD BE THAT FOR SOUTH EAST SCOTLAND AND NORTH EAST ENGLAND 
THERE'LL BE MORE LOW CLOUD DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY 
COS WE PICK UP A SLIGHT SOUTH EASTERLY WIND 
I MIGHT MAKE THINGS A BIT GREY 
BUT WILL CERTAINLY GIVE US THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN THESE AREAS 
WITH MORE CLOUD TO START THE DAY 
IT WILL BE LOW CLOUD FIRST THING 
AND THE APRIL SUNSHINE SHOULD GET TO WORK ON IT 
BUT ALREADY WE'VE GOT THAT SUNSHINE FURTHER WEST 
WHICH WILL LIFT TEMPERATURES QUITE QUICKLY IN THE MORNING 
AT THE SAME TIME THE SUNSHINE WILL BREAK SOME HOLES IN THIS CLOUD 
ENCOURAGING SOME SHOWER FORMATION 
AND ONCE AGAIN THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE FOCUSED 
ACROSS THE EASTERN SIDE OF ENGLAND 
PARTICULARLY HEAVY FOR EAST ANGLIA AND LINCOLNSHIRE 
SO WE'LL CATCH A FEW WINTRY ONES ACROSS THE PENNINES 
INTO THE AFTERNOON THE ODD RUMBLE OF THUNDER 
COULD CATCH LIGHT SHOWERS UP INTO SOUTH EAST SCOTLAND 
BUT THE BULK OF SCOTLAND DRY NORTH AND WEST HIGHLANDS SEEING THE BEST 
OF THE SUNSHINE BEAUTIFUL IN GLASGOW ELEVEN DEGREES WE HOPE 
THE SUNSHINE HERE AND BELFAST AT ELEVEN DEGREES 
WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY MAKES 
WALES WHERE WE HAD SHOWER AFTER SHOWER TODAY 
SHOULD SEE MORE SUNSHINE AND DRY WEATHER 
A VERY PLEASANT ELEVEN IN CARDIFF 
ELEVEN IN PLYMOUTH WHERE WE'LL HAVE A REPEAT OF THE DAY TODAY 
JUST THE CHANCE THAT THE WIND WILL STRAIGHTEN IN THE DAY 
THE START OF A CHANGE WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT LATER 
A BIT MORE CLOUD AROUND THE SOUTH EAST THAN WE HAD TODAY 
BUT STILL PLEASANT THE OUTSIDE CHANCE OF A SHOWER 
MOST OF THE SHOWERS WILL BE FURTHER NORTH OF THE THAMES 
THEY WILL EASE DURING WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY 
THE FROST RETURNS TO THE NORTH BUT IN THE SOUTH TEMPERATURES HOLD UP 
DESPITE CLEAR SKIES BECAUSE OF A STRENGTHENING WIND 
WHICH WILL BLOW MORE CLOUD IN FOR THURSDAY 
BUT ESSENTIALLY THERE'LL BE A LOT OF DRY WEATHER 
ESPECIALLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE THE SHOWERS START AGAIN 
ACROSS THE NORTH AND CENTRAL AREAS 
BUT THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE THIS IS A BRISK EASTERLY WIND 
AN EASTERLY WIND NO GOOD TO MAN NOR BEAST THEY SAY 
WHATEVER TIME OF YEAR 
IT WILL MAKE IT FEEL COLDER 
AND WILL START TO BRING IN THE RAIN AGAIN 
BY THE END OF THE WEEK 
SO WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY 
ARE LOOKING DECENT 
BECAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE 
BY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WE'LL HAVE SHOWERS 
IF NOT MORE PERSISTENT OUTBREAKS OF RAIN 
IF YOU WANT MORE WEATHER INFORMATION 
YOU CAN FIND THAT ON OUR WEBSITE HERE 
BUT FROM ME HAVE A VERY GOOD EVENING 
YOU'VE BEEN THE ONE TO BEAT 
THERE IS NO COMPETITION 
NO ONE'S GONNA MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME 
DING DING ROUND TWO 
WHICH IS BETTER THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT
