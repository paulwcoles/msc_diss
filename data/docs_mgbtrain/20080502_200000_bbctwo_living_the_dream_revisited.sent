IN TWO THOUSAND TWO LIVING THE DREAM FOLLOWED THIS MAN'S QUEST 
TO MOVE TO SPAIN WITH HIS WIFE HIS EX WIFE AND HER SECOND HUSBAND 
THE TWO FAMILIES PLANNED TO RUN A B. AND AMP B. TOGETHER 
BUT CRACKS SOON APPEARED IN THE RELATIONSHIP 
SHE'S A SAD SILLY LITTLE COW ISN'T SHE I'M SORRY BUT SHE IS 
AND FIVE YEARS ON BOB AND TRACY ARE STILL NOT EXACTLY LIVING THE DREAM 
SHEEP POOP GOAT POOP HORSE POOP I'M ALWAYS PICKING UP POOP 
I HAD FOUR BROKEN RIBS SMASHED MY HEAD 
MY LEG WAS BAD AND I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA DIE 
THE TROUBLE IS IF YOU DROVE OFF THAT MOUNTAIN NEXT WEEK AND KILLED YOURSELF WHAT I AM SUPPOSED TO DO 
I HAVEN'T EVEN GOT THE HOUSE SORTED AND LEGAL 
I NEVER WANT TO COME BACK TO THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN 
BUT FOR THE OTHERS LIFE IS RETURNING TO NORMAL 
YOU'RE SPEAKING TO JENNY CUSTOMER SERVICES HOW CAN I HELP 
IT'S MARCH TWO THOUSAND TWO 
AND THE WOODS AND THE AVERY'S ARE GOING INTO PARTNERSHIP 
WITH TWO SONS THREE MARRIAGES FIVE DOGS AND TEN CATS BETWEEN THEM 
THINGS ARE BOUND TO GET MESSY 
IT'S SIX WEEKS TILL THEY LEAVE 
BOB WOODS THROUGH WITH INSTALLING ELECTRICITY FOR LONDON BUS SHELTERS 
I HATE STANDING HERE IN A HOLE AND THE RAIN'S RUNNING OUT OF MY ARSE 
WE'RE LOOKING AT GOING FROM TWO SMALL TWO BEDROOM PROPERTIES 
TO PERHAPS TWENTY FIVE ROOMS AND SIX ACRES OF LAND I MEAN 
BUT WITH NO FIRM PLAN IN PLACE 
BOB'S EX WIFE JENNY AVERY ISN'T QUITE SO CONFIDENT 
IT'S TOTALLY OUT OF CHARACTER FOR ME TOTALLY 
COS EVERYTHING'S ALWAYS SO ORGANISED IN MY LIFE 
AND THIS ISN'T BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOT ANYWHERE TO MOVE TO 
THEY'VE AGREED SALES ON BOTH FAMILY HOMES NEAR BASILDON IN ESSEX 
ALLOWING EACH COUPLE TO PUT FORTY THREE THOUSAND INTO THE VENTURE 
AS THE DEPARTURE DATE APPROACHES 
BOB AND TRACY GO TO JENNY AND SIMON'S TO FINALISE THEIR PLANS 
HELLO 
THE PARTNERSHIP'S ALREADY BEING TESTED 
MY PLAN IS WHEN I HIT SPAIN I'M GONNA LOOK IMMEDIATELY FOR SOMETHING TO DO 
WORK A COUPLE OF DAYS A WEEK BUT 
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOOK AT HOUSES EVERY SINGLE DAY OF THE WEEK ARE YOU 
SEE THAT'S WHERE WE THAT'S WHERE WE DIFFER WE WOULD 
OUR PRIORITY IS THE HOUSE 
YOU CAN'T SIT IDLY BY 
NO ONE'S SAID ABOUT SITTING IDLY BY 
NO BUT WE GOT TO BE CLEAR ON 
THE CONSENSUS IS THAT THE MAIN PRIORITY IS TO BUY A PROPERTY 
THAT WILL HOUSE THE TWO FAMILIES 
BUT ALSO PROVIDE A BUSINESS IN THE FORM OF BED AND BREAKFAST 
I THOUGHT WE'D ALREADY AGREED THAT 
I'M JUST OFFERING IT UP TO THE TABLE IS EVERYBODY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CERTAIN 
OH YEAH YEAH 
WELL I AM IF WE DON'T OPEN A BED AND BREAKFAST WHAT WOULD WE DO 
WELL I GET THE FEELING THAT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT 
WE WON'T WORK AS HARD AS THEM AND WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN THE BED AND BREAKFAST 
AND I GET THE FEELING THAT I'M BEING DUG AT 
IT'S NOT A DIG AT ANYONE 
IF ANYONE'S GOT ANY SECOND THOUGHTS 
NOW'S THE TIME TO SAY SO 
A LONG TIME AGO WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TIME TO SAY SO 
NO NOW BECAUSE WE'RE ON OUR WAY 
ANYBODY WANT A CUP OF TEA YES PLEASE YEAH NO THANKS 
BOTH FAMILIES WILL SAVE MONEY BY DRIVING TO SPAIN 
JENNY AND SIMON ARE CONVERTING A NINETEEN SEATER COUNCIL BUS FOR THE DISABLED 
INTO A CAMPER VAN 
WELL IT'S FIFTEEN INCHES 
THE BUS COST THIRTEEN HUNDRED 
BOB'S BEEN EVEN MORE ECONOMICAL 
HE'S BOUGHT A CARAVAN FOR FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY AND A VAN TO TOW IT FOR SIX HUNDRED 
WHAT ON EARTH DID I DO WITH ALL THE BITS 
IT NEEDS A LITTLE ATTENTION 
JIMMY 
YEAH HOW'S IT GO BACK TOGETHER 
THE CONVOY'S MEANT TO LEAVE TODAY 
BUT BOB AND TRACY'S PET TRAVEL CERTIFICATES AREN'T READY ON TIME 
JENNY AND SIMON HAVE GOT THEIRS AND ARE DUE TO HIT THE ROAD THIS EVENING 
BUT THINGS AREN'T GOING TOO SMOOTHLY FOR THE ORGANISED ONES 
WE'VE GOT TO BE OUT OF HERE BY TWELVE O'CLOCK 
IT'S QUARTER TO FOUR 
TIME'S UP THE NEW OWNERS ARE AT THE DOOR 
QUICK I DON'T WANT TO LET ANY CATS OUT 
ALL I'VE GOT TO DO IS GET OUT THIS HOUSE COS IT'S NOW ILLEGAL 
IN THE RUSH TO MOVE OUT 
SIMON AND JENNY HAVEN'T QUITE FINISHED CONVERTING THEIR BUS 
THREE DAYS LATER THEY'RE STILL IN ENGLAND 
THEY'VE CAMPED OUT AT THE EX'S WHILE THEY GET THE BUS FINISHED 
WE DIDN'T GO SATURDAY MORNING WE DIDN'T GO SATURDAY AFTERNOON 
WE'VE BEEN CAMPED AT BOB'S HOUSE FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS 
THEY'VE MOVED IN 
THEY HAD NO WHERE ELSE TO GO SO THEY HAD TO COME HERE 
FINALLY THE BUS IS FINISHED 
THEY HAVE TO LEAVE NOW AS THEY'VE ONLY GOT SIX HOURS 
TO ENTER FRANCE BEFORE THEIR PET CERTIFICATES EXPIRE 
SEE YOU IN A COUPLE OF DAYS GET THE KETTLE ON 
WE WILL DO 
TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD TERRY SON OF JENNY AND BOB 
IS HOT ON THE HEELS OF HIS MUM'S BUS 
THEY'RE HEADING FOR BARCELONA 
WHERE THEY'LL WAIT FOR THE OTHERS TO CATCH UP 
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT IT'S THE DOG 
MOST DISOBEDIENT DOG I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE 
THE JOURNEY WILL END IN ALMERIA IN SOUTH EAST SPAIN 
WHERE LAND'S MUCH CHEAPER THAN ON THE COSTAS 
TWO DAYS LATER BOB AND TRACY HAVE GOT THEIR PET CERTIFICATES 
THEY'RE READY TO GO 
COME ON GIRL COME ON GIRL COME ON GIRL COME ON GIRL 
DO US A FAVOUR STEVE SPRAY SOME OF THAT STUFF IN THERE 
WHERE IS IT UNDER THE SEAT 
NO NO YOU LOOK TRACE HE'S GOT A PROBLEM 
PRAYER AND A WING STUFF THIS AIN'T IT 
EVERY DAY FROM NOW UNTIL THE GUEST HOUSE OPENS 
THE FAMILIES AND THEIR PETS WILL BE EATING INTO THEIR SAVINGS 
COME ON UP THERE'S A GOOD BOY COME ON UP YOU GO 
OH NO PROBLEM 
YES BARCELONA 
SOMETIME AROUND SUNDAY 
SEE YOU 
YEAH I'M GONNA MISS YOU MATE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE ACTUALLY BLOODY GOING 
GIVE US TEN MINUTES WALK DOWN THE ROAD AND WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE BROKEN DOWN 
SEE YA 
PROGRESS IN THE SIX HUNDRED VAN IS PAINFULLY SLOW 
GOT ME DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER IT'S GONNA GET UP THE HILLS 
A FEW DOUBTS 
IT'S A MIRACLE WE'RE HERE 
I RECKON THE FELLA THAT SOLD US THAT 
IS SITTING AT HOME PISSING HIS PANTS WITH LAUGHTER THAT IS ABSOLUTELY 
I BET WHEN HE SOLD IT HE THOUGHT YEAH I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM GET 
OVER THE PYRENEES WITH THAT PIECE OF OLD CRAP 
IT TAKES THREE DAYS TO DO LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED MILES 
AND THEY'RE STILL IN NORMANDY 
THEY WERE PLANNING TO BE IN SPAIN BY NOW 
IT'S A MINIATURE HELL IN THAT CAR 
DIDN'T WANT TO MOVE IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT 
HAD NO CHOICE 
GIVE IT A LITTLE SNIFF 
THE WORLD'S GOING TO COME TO AN END 
I FEEL AS IF I'M ON SCRAP HEAP CHALLENGE 
OH YOU CHEEKY LITTLE SOD 
THE EX DISABLED BUS IS HUNDREDS OF MILES AHEAD SPEEDING TOWARDS SPAIN 
THEY'VE BROUGHT ALONG CLIVE A FAMILY FRIEND 
TO SHARE BUS DRIVING DUTIES 
TERRY INSISTS ON DRIVING HIS OWN CAR 
STILL IN CENTRAL FRANCE BOB'S VAN GETS SLOWER AND SLOWER 
YOU MAY START YOUR MESSAGE NOW 
YVONNE WHY ARE YOU NOT IN RIGHT NOW I'M RINGING YOU FROM FRANCE YOU STUPID WOMAN 
WE'VE BROKEN DOWN THE GEARBOX HAS GONE AND WE'RE NOW STRANDED 
AND WE'RE STAYING AT A HOLIDAY CAMP 
THE ADVANCE PARTY HAS ARRIVED NEAR BARCELONA 
AND SET UP CAMP IN THE BUS TO WAIT FOR NEWS FROM THE OTHERS 
WHAT IS UNSETTLING ME MOST IS TERRY NOT FEELING SETTLED 
LEAVING ALL HIS FRIENDS BEHIND 
HE DIDN'T REALISE IT WOULD BE AS BAD AS WHAT IT HAS BEEN FOR HIM 
I COULD UNDERSTAND IF IT WAS A GIRL COULDN'T I 
HE'S NOT INTO GIRLS AT THE MOMENT HE'S INTO CARS 
SO HE SAYS 
BY THE END OF THE DAY BOB HAS SOME GOOD NEWS FOR THE OTHERS 
TOMORROW I'M BUYING A NEW VAN 
YOU'RE AT THE CAMPSITE NOW ARE YOU 
VILLA ROSS 
I RECKON I'LL BE THERE BY ABOUT THURSDAY 
SINCE HIS DEAL ON THE OLD VAN WAS A FALSE ECONOMY 
BOB'S GOING TO SPEND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ON THE NEW VAN 
THAT'S JUST ABOUT KILLED 
OUR OWN LITTLE PERSONAL SAFETY NET COMPLETELY 
SO WE'LL HAVE NO MONEY IN THE BANK IN ENGLAND 
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE OVER HERE PUT IN THE KITTY IN SPAIN 
BUT WE WILL STILL MANAGE FORTY THREE THOUSAND LIKE I PROMISED SIMON 
IT'S THE AVERY'S THIRD DAY WAITING 
AND THEY'RE DOUBTFUL BOB'LL BE WITH THEM AS QUICKLY AS HE SAYS 
WE'VE CALCULATED THAT THEY SHOULD HIT US EITHER 
LATE FRIDAY EVENING OR EARLY SATURDAY MORNING IF THEY WANT TO PUSH IT 
SO WHERE WE ARE IS WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO 
NOT BOTHERED SHALL WE HANG ABOUT HERE THEN 
YEAH 
SO IF HE'S NOT GONNA REACH US BY SATURDAY THEN WE MARCH 
WE MARCH ON ON THE SUNDAY 
BOB'S NEW VAN IS SPEEDIER THAN SIMON PREDICTED 
YEAH WE'RE GONNA OVERTAKE SOMETHING AGAIN 
COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS IN THE OTHER VAN 
STUNNING SCENERY IT'S LOVELY 
WHEN THEY'RE REUNITED ON FRIDAY MORNING 
BOB'S EXPECTING THE OTHERS WILL BE ITCHING TO DO THE LAST LEG OF THE JOURNEY 
BUT JENNY AND SIMON WON'T BUDGE FROM THEIR NEW PLAN TO LEAVE ON SUNDAY 
IF WE RUN DOWN TO ALICANTE TOMORROW 
AND WAIT THERE AND THEN SEE WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING 
AND WE'LL MEET UP TO GO DOWN SUNDAY 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY SUNDAY 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO DO THE WHOLE LOT IN ONE DAY 
TERRY AIN'T GOING TO WANT TO 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO FROM HERE 
TO ALBOX IN ONE DAY 
SO 
NO RUSH IS THERE AS SUCH NO 
PROBLEM IS WE'VE GOT FIVE STINKY CATS IN THE CARAVAN KILLING US AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S SO HOT IN THERE YOURS IS COOL COMPARED TO OURS 
IT IS STEAMING IN THERE THEY'RE GONNA START 
SHE'S FIVE WEEKS PREGNANT AND I'M GONNA LOSE MY KITTENS 
THIS IS OUR FOURTH NIGHT HERE NOW WAITING FOR BOB AND TRACY 
WE DON'T WANT TO TRAVEL AGAIN UNTIL SUNDAY BECAUSE THE ROADS 
WE FEEL ARE GONNA BE BUSY TOMORROW BEING SATURDAY 
AND BASICALLY THEY'RE NOT PREPARED TO HANG ABOUT ONE MORE NIGHT SO AS WE CAN ALL TRAVEL DOWN TOGETHER 
SO OUR STOPOVER HERE WAITING FOR THEM HAS BEEN A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME 
IT'S A TOTAL SURPRISE THAT THEY GOT YOU KNOW THEY GOT HERE THIS FAST 
NOBODY FOLLOWED THE ROUTE THAT WE HAD SET IN MIND 
THEY'RE NOT PUTTING THEIR AWNING UP EVERY NIGHT WHEN THEY SAID THEY WOULD 
IT JUST SEEMS TO BE ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER 
THAT EVERYTHING THEY SAID THEY WERE GONNA DO HASN'T HAPPENED 
IF IT'S LIKE THAT TRAVELLING WHAT'S IT GONNA BE LIKE WHEN WE GET THERE 
YOU CAN'T GO INTO BUSINESS LIKE THAT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A PLAN AND A FOCUS 
AND ALSO YOU KNOW IF A CAT IS PREGNANT 
WHY IS IT TRAVELLING IN HOT CONDITIONS PREGNANT YOU KNOW 
SURELY AS A HUMAN BEING YOU WOULD YOU WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU WAS PREGNANT 
WOULD YOU JEN AIN'T TRAVELLED WHEN I WAS PREGNANT 
IF THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO THEN WHY DID THEY HAVE US RUSH DOWN HERE 
WHY DIDN'T THEY SAY OH WE'VE GOT NO INTENTIONS OF LEAVING HERE 
TILL SUNDAY SO DON'T KILL YOURSELF THEN 
THEY WERE THE ONES WHINGING ABOUT HOW THEY'VE GOT NO SODDING MONEY 
AND HOW THEY'VE GOT TO GET DOWN THERE AND BUY A HOUSE 
COS THEY'RE SO BLEEDING SKINT AND NOW THEY'RE THE ONES 
SITTING UP HERE HOLIDAYING IT AND SPENDING MONEY TO STOP UP HERE 
SO THEY'LL MAKE THEIR MIND UP WON'T THEY 
THEY SAY ONE THING AND SOMETHING ELSE THE NEXT DAY 
THEY CAN GET ON WITH IT 
AFTER MUCH AGONISING JENNY AND SIMON HAVE DECIDED TO BACK OUT OF THE PARTNERSHIP 
WE HAD ALREADY MADE CALCULATIONS THAT WE COULD DO IT ON OUR FINANCES 
AS A COUPLE ON OUR OWN AND WE ALWAYS HAD THIS AS A BACK UP PLAN 
WE'VE GOT THE SKILLS OF DETERMINATION 
AND WE'VE GOT THE BACKING OF TERRY TO MAKE A GO OF IT 
I FEEL AT THE MOMENT IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO TELL THEM 
JUST AS THEY'RE STARTING OUT ON THEIR JOURNEY 
I THINK WE'RE TOO NICE PEOPLE 
TO DROP THAT ON THEM AND THEN JUST SAY GOODBYE 
SOME PEOPLE GET ROAD RAGE WHEN THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN BAD NEWS 
AND WHAT I DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN IS AN ACCIDENT TO BE CAUSED 
UNAWARE THAT THE PARTNERSHIP IS DOOMED BOB AND TRACY SET OFF AGAIN 
TEN DAYS AFTER LEAVING ESSEX THEY ARRIVE IN ALMERIA 
BEST KNOWN AS THE SETTING FOR SPAGHETTI WESTERNS 
THE TWO FAMILIES ARE RENTING WHILE THEY HOUSE HUNT 
THE REMOTE PROPERTY MIGHT BE UP FOR SALE AS A POTENTIAL B. AND AMP B. 
IT WOULD TAKE A BIT OF WORK TO MAKE THIS PLACE COMFORTABLE 
THERE'S NO HOT WATER NO MOBILE SIGNAL AND NO ELECTRICITY 
THERE'S NO ELECTRIC 
YEAH THAT'S WHY WE BROUGHT A GENERATOR 
THE RENT'S ONLY TWELVE A WEEK 
JAMES ISN'T CONVINCED IT'S THE IDEAL LOCATION 
ALL IT IS IS A HOUSE AND A RUIN 
I MEAN THERE'S A VILLAGE OVER THERE BUT THAT'S PRACTICALLY DESERTED 
ALL THAT I'VE SEEN OF IT IS A BLOKE WITH SOME GOATS 
IT SUITS ME 
BEING AWAY FROM ESSEX BEING AWAY FROM NEIGHBOURS 
WAKING UP ON A HOUSING ESTATE EVERY MORNING WITH CARS DRIVING BY 
WAKE UP HERE LOOK 
A FEW HOURS LATER 
BOB GETS AN URGENT CALL FROM HIS BUSINESS PARTNER 
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM 
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM H. M. M. JENNY WANTS TO GO HOME 
OH NO SHE WANTS TO GO BACK TO ENGLAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
REALLY YEAH 
OH BLIMEY 
TERRY WANTS TO GO HOME OH BLIMEY 
HE'S MISSING HIS FRIENDS TOO MUCH 
JENNY BASICALLY STAMPED HER FEET AND SAID 
I WANT TO GO BACK TO ENGLAND 
I'VE GOT TO GET THE PETS VETTED SO I CAN TAKE THEM BACK TO ENGLAND 
ARE YOU STAYING WHERE YOU ARE 
WE AIN'T GONNA STAY HERE JENNY DOESN'T LIKE IT HERE 
THEY'RE GOING HOME AREN'T THEY 
YEAH THE DOG WAS SICK THINGS GOT STRESSED 
AND JENNY STARTED STAMPING HER FEET AND SAID I'VE HAD ENOUGH I WANT TO GO HOME 
WELL THEN SHE'S A SAD SILLY LITTLE COW THEN ISN'T SHE 
I'M SORRY BUT SHE IS 
SHE'S SOLD HER HOUSE SPENT ALL THAT MONEY 
COME ALL THIS WAY AND COS THE DOG'S SICK SHE WANTS TO GO HOME 
I DON'T THINK IT'S COS THE DOG'S SICK I THINK SHE JUST 
I THINK THE UPHEAVAL'S JUST UPSET THEM ALL 
I WAS MARRIED TO JENNY FOR NINETEEN YEARS SO I'M QUITE AWARE OF HER 
CHANGING MOODS 
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ANYBODY COULD COME OUT HERE 
AND WANT TO GO BACK TO ESSEX 
COR THAT SMELLS NICE 
MUST BE MAD ABSOLUTELY MAD 
WITH THEIR PET PASSPORTS NOW EXPIRED 
JENNY AND SIMON CAN'T TAKE THE ANIMALS STRAIGHT BACK HOME 
SO WITH NOWHERE ELSE TO GO THEY'RE FORCED TO JOIN THE OTHERS 
WHEN THEY MEET AT THEIR ESTATE AGENT'S OFFICE THE MEN ARE TALKING 
BUT JENNY AND TRACY AREN'T COMMUNICATING AT ALL 
IT'S A STAND OFF 
THERE'S NO WAY IT'S GETTING DOWN THERE NO WAY 
SIMON PLEASE INSIDE THE MINIBUS 
WHY DOES PEOPLE DON'T TRUST MY DRIVING COS OF YOUR EYESIGHT 
I'M NOT STAYING IN THE BLOODY AMBULANCE ON MY OWN 
AND WE'RE GONNA BE WANTING TO MOVE ON IN A COUPLE OF DAYS 
RATHER THAN WALK DOWN THE HILL TO THE HOUSE JENNY AND SIMON CHOOSE TO CAMP IN THE BUS 
LATER BOB PAYS THEM A CONCILIATORY VISIT 
ARE YOU STILL THINKING OF GOING BACK HOME 
IT'S A POSSIBILITY REALLY 
THE POSSIBILITY'S STILL THERE BUT 
IS THAT COS YOU WANT TO OR COS TERRY WANTS TO 
NO TERRY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTS TO DO 
HE DOESN'T KNOW STILL DOESN'T KNOW OH NO 
WHAT WE WOULD ASK YOU AND TRACY TO DO IS CONTINUE LOOKING FOR PROPERTY 
BUT LOOK MAINLY FOR YOURSELVES NOW 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT 
AH 
AH 
BEFORE LONG BOB AND TRACY HAVE DECIDED THIS IS THE HOUSE FOR THEM 
THAT IS LOVELY 
WE'VE LOOKED AT A FEW PROPERTIES NOTHING MATCHED WHAT THIS IS 
IT'S LOVELY IN THE EVENINGS YOU GET THE BIRDS AND ALL THAT IT'S NICE 
THEY'VE ASKED THE LANDLORD AN ENGLISH ESTATE AGENT TO SELL 
IT'S PART OF AN EIGHT ACRE PLOT OF LAND 
BUT HE'S AGREED TO SELL THEM JUST THE HOUSE AND AN ACRE 
THEY'VE COME TO SHAKE ON IT WITH LANDLORD JOE LAKE AT HIS HOME 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY TO CELEBRATE US BUYING OUR HOUSE 
WHERE'S MY CHEQUE 
WATCH YOUR HAND THOUGH 
GO ON YEAH 
NICE ONE WE CAN HAVE ALCOHOLIC WATER 
DON'T WORRY HERE WE GO OOH THIS IS 
THEY'VE SIGNED THE CONTRACT BUT JOE STILL NEEDS PERMISSION 
TO DIVIDE HIS LAND IN TWO BEFORE HE CAN DRAW UP NEW DEEDS 
THE PRICE OF FORTY THOUSAND WILL LEAVE THEM NO MONEY FOR RENOVATION 
LET ALONE THE B. AND AMP B. 
JENNY AND SIMON HAVE ALSO GIVEN UP ON THEIR B. AND AMP B. DREAM 
BUT THEY'VE DECIDED TO STAY IN SPAIN AND BECOME PROPERTY DEVELOPERS 
THEY'VE MOVED TO A CAMPSITE AND SO FAR THEY'VE LOOKED AT DOZENS OF PROPERTIES 
JENNY AND I ARE NOT QUITTERS WE HAVE GOT RAGGED DETERMINATION 
BEFORE LONG THEIR RESOLVE PAYS OFF 
THE HOUSE FOR THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND IS WITHIN THEIR BUDGET 
BUT IT NEEDS A COMPLETE REFURBISHMENT 
THIS PART OF THE WALL 
BIT OF A MESS YEAH BIT OF A MESS BUT LIVEABLE MESS 
THEY DECIDE TO BUY 
THE BUILDERS BEGIN A MONTH LATER 
JENNY AND SIMON HAVE GONE FOR THE CHEAPEST QUOTE AROUND FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
WE'VE ESTIMATED ABOUT TEN TWELVE WEEKS TOPS SO 
LUCKILY ENOUGH THERE'S NO MAJOR STRUCTURAL WORK SO IT'S JUST A LOT OF IT'S COSMETIC 
GASPING FOR A CUP OF TEA 
THE FAMILY WILL DO AS MUCH LABOURING AS POSSIBLE THEMSELVES 
IN ORDER TO CONSERVE THEIR DWINDLING FUNDS 
IT'S A LOUD SHIRT 
BOB AND TRACY HAVE DISCOVERED THE AREA IS FULL OF EX PATS 
WHEN WE FIRST CAME HERE THERE WAS TWO ENGLISH FAMILIES US AND ANOTHER ONE 
WE WERE THE FIRST ENGLISH THEN OTHER PEOPLE CAME OUT NOW THERE'S LOADS OF US 
THEY'RE CELEBRATING THE INSTALLATION OF BOB'S FOUR THOUSAND SECOND HAND SOLAR POWER SYSTEM 
YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY TO COME UP HERE SOON 
TWO MONTHS ON JENNY AND SIMON ARE IN TROUBLE 
BUILDING COSTS HAVE SPIRALLED 
AND THEY'VE HAD TO TAKE OUT A FIVE THOUSAND LOAN 
AND WHEN CHALLENGED ABOUT THE COST OF MATERIALS 
THEIR ENGLISH BUILDERS WALKED OFF THE JOB 
HOLA BOB'S COME TO INSPECT THE DAMAGE 
JESUS 
I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL MYSELF BUT I COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB 
YOU CAN'T TRUST ANY ENGLISH PEOPLE IN SPAIN WHATSOEVER 
WE'VE STILL GOT PART OF A DREAM OF SETTING UP OUT HERE 
BUT THE MORE CRAP THAT KEEPS GETTING THROWN AT US 
THE LESS THAT DREAM BECOMES REALITY 
WE'VE TAKEN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS NOW HAVEN'T WE YEAH 
IF IT HAD BEEN ME AND SIMON WHO HAD DIFFERENCES WE'D HAVE SPOKE ABOUT THEM 
AND THE GIRLS UNFORTUNATELY NEITHER OF THEM ARE 
THEY'RE BOTH HEADSTRONG 
YEAH COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT NICER IF THEY'D SHALL WE SAY 
I DON'T KNOW WERE SLIGHTLY MORE ADULT WITH THEIR DIFFERENCES 
SIMON JENNY AND TERRY STRUGGLE ON ALONE 
BUT THEY'VE DECIDED THAT A CAREER IN PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT ISN'T FOR THEM 
AND WANT TO RETURN TO ESSEX 
THE LOCATION'S NOT REALLY IDEAL 
SPAIN FOR US IT HASN'T GOT WHAT WE WANT HAS IT 
NO NO IT WAS MORE OF A. 
THIS WAS SECOND BEST AND AT THE TIME 
WHAT MONEY WE HAD IT'S THE BEST WE COULD AFFORD 
AND FOR JENNY AND I WITH OUR ENGLISH EXPERIENCE WE HAD IN RETAIL 
MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OUT HERE 
THEY NEED TO FINISH THE HOUSE BEFORE THEY SELL IN ORDER TO GET THE BEST PRICE 
THEY HOPE TO EARN SOMETHING FROM RENTING UPSTAIRS ONCE IT'S FINISHED 
WHILE THEY CONTINUE WORK DOWNSTAIRS 
BUT BOB'S MAKING ENOUGH TO GET BY 
HE'S GONE INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH MIKE A FELLOW BRITISH BUILDER 
MET UP IN THE BARS A COUPLE OF TIMES AND MIKE CAME UP ONE DAY AND HE SAYS 
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY WHAT ABOUT COMING TO WORK FOR ME 
SO WE DID 
DOING PATIOS GENERAL GARDEN WORK BASICALLY 
WHAT THEY DON'T GET OFFERED BY THE MAIN BUILDERS HERE 
IT'S QUITE LUCRATIVE BOB ISN'T IT 
YEAH IT IS OUR WORK'S GROWING NOW 
CERTAINLY GOT WORK INTO SEPTEMBER AND PROBABLY THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER 
BEFORE WE'VE GOT TO STRUGGLE AGAIN NOW 
TOMORROW TRACY'S CELEBRATING HER FORTIETH WITH SOME UNEXPECTED GUESTS 
JENNY AND SIMON ARE COMING 
YEAH THAT'LL BE NICE EVERYBODY TOGETHER 
AND THEY CAN MEET SOME OF OUR FRIENDS THEN AND HOPEFULLY MAKE SOME OF THEIR OWN 
I AM SURPRISED VERY SURPRISED 
AS LONG AS THEY'RE POLITE TO ME I'M POLITE TO THEM AND 
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES AIN'T IT 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 
WE GOT CHATTING TO THEM OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AND NEXT THING WE KNOW 
THEY GOT US SOME CAT LITTER 
ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL FOUR OF US JUST WERE TALKING AS NOTHING WAS AROUND 
THAT'S IT REALLY AIN'T IT 
JENNY AND SIMON ARRIVE FOR THE PARTY 
IT'S THEIR FIRST VISIT TO THE HOUSE 
LAST TIME THEY ONLY GOT AS FAR AS THE TOP OF THE DRIVE 
HELLO 
THAT'S A GORGEOUS COLOUR 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY THANK YOU 
NICE 
I'M BEING NICE 
NO IT'S NICE TO SEE SIMON AND JENNY BECAUSE WE CAN STAY FRIENDS 
THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT IN BUSINESS TOGETHER DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING 
AND WE CAN STAY FRIENDS AND THAT'S GOOD 
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT FRIENDS OUT HERE 
YOU'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE 
IN SPITE OF A BUSY SOCIAL LIFE THE HONEYMOON PERIOD'S OVER FOR TRACY 
SO WHAT'S THE DRAWBACKS OF LIVING UP HERE 
NO ELECTRIC NO PHONE A HORRIBLE HUSBAND 
A HUSBAND THAT SITS IN THE PUB TILL NINE HUNDRED THIRTY GETTING PISSED WITH HIS MATES 
WHILE ME AND JAMES ARE EATING WEETABIX FOR DINNER 
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT NO CAR BECAUSE HE'S DRIVEN IT OFF THE CLIFF 
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY FOOD 
SO WE HAD WEETABIX FOR DINNER 
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME I DIDN'T KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY FOOD 
I DIDN'T KNOW DID I BUT IF YOU'D COME HOME 
TO CHECK ON YOUR POOR WIFE WHO'S LIVING AT THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WITH NO ELECTRIC AND NO PHONE AND NO CAR 
I'D HAVE BEEN HOME LIKE A SHOT I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A DRINK 
I DON'T GO IN THE BAR EVERY NIGHT DRINKING ONLY VERY OCCASIONALLY 
HARK AT HIM LOOK HE'S AS PISSED AS A FART 
YEAH BOTH PLAYING 
DESPITE THEIR PREDICAMENT 
JENNY AND SIMON CAN'T RESIST ADOPTING MORE CATS BY THE WEEK 
COME ON LITTLE UN OFF YOU COME 
ON THE SATURDAY WE ACQUIRED THREE ON THE TUESDAY WE PICKED UP ANOTHER ONE 
AND THEY WILL ALL BE COMING BACK TO ENGLAND 
THE PET BILL SOMETIMES OUTRANKS WHAT WE SPEND ON OURSELVES EATING 
AT LEAST FORTY PER CENT OF THE SHOPPING 
WITH SO MANY MOUTHS TO FEED AND LITTLE LEFT IN THE BANK 
SIMON'S FORCED TO GO OUT TO WORK 
UNLOAD THE CEMENT FIRST 
FIFTY TO A PALLET 
SIMON'S NEW ROLE IS GENERAL LABOURER FOR ENGLISH CHIP SHOP OWNER BARRY 
SIMON YOU'RE SACKED 
I'M SACKED AGAIN 
BUT WITHOUT SIMON WORK ON THE HOUSE IS LOSING MOMENTUM 
IT IS NEVER ENDING 
YOU GET VERY FRUSTRATED AT TIMES 
COS YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE DOING A LOT MORE AND YOU CAN'T 
YOU JUST CAN'T GET UP IN THE MORNING 
IT'S NOT LIKE THE SAME AS GETTING UP AND GOING TO WORK AND STARTING A JOB AND DOING A TEN HOUR DAY 
THERE'S OTHER THINGS WE HAVE TO DO IN THE MEANTIME 
DESPERATE FOR EXTRA CASH JENNY WANTS TO IMPRESS SIMON'S BOSS BARRY 
IN THE HOPE THAT HE'LL SELL HER CAKES IN HIS FISH AND CHIP SHOP 
LOOK WHAT I'VE BAKED FOR YOU 
HE AIN'T GOT TIME HE'S MENDING THE PLUG 
I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THE BEACH WITH A THONG ON 
M. M. M. IS THIS OUT OF A PACKET OR DID YOU DO IT YOURSELF 
NO STRAIGHT FROM THE 
NORMAL FLOUR AND EGGS 
FLOUR EGGS AND SUGAR HAND MADE 
I COULDN'T EAT A WHOLE ONE 
FOR THE SAKE OF FAMILY HARMONY BOB'S BOUGHT TRACY A NEW CAR FOR EIGHT HUNDRED EUROS 
I'M OUT ALL THE TIME NOW I'M NEVER AT HOME 
IT'S BRILLIANT 
NOW SHE'S MOBILE TRACY'S GONE IN TO BUSINESS AS AN AVON LADY 
HELLO BABY 
AVON BOOKS 
DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS OVER HERE WELL IT'S HERE NOW ANYWAY 
SO WHAT DATE DO YOU THINK THE ANIMALS WILL BE READY NOW THEN 
APRIL APRIL SHOULD BE IN APRIL 
IF I HAD MY WAY IF THE PETS WERE READY I'D GO BACK TO ENGLAND AND SELL THE HOUSE AS IT IS NOW 
JUST LEAVE EVERYTHING AND GO BECAUSE I'M SO FED UP AND 
DISHEARTENED WITH THE WHOLE THING 
IT'S NOT EASY 
AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR'S HARD WORK 
JENNY SIMON AND TERRY'S HOUSE STILL ISN'T FINISHED 
SO FOR NOW THEY'RE STUCK IN SPAIN 
BOB AND TRACY SEEM TO HAVE FOUND THEIR DREAM HOME 
BUT THEY'RE NO LONGER ALONE 
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA BE NEW NEIGHBOURS TO ME 
WONDER IF THAT'S GONNA BE A TERRACE LOOKING OUT OVER OUR HOUSE 
DON'T KNOW COULD BE I SUPPOSE 
I RECKON IN TWO YEARS' TIME THERE'LL BE TWENTY ODD HOUSES IN THE LEMON GROVES HERE 
IT'S A SHAME ISN'T IT 
FOUR YEARS ON BOB IS STILL IN SPAIN 
AND STILL HAVING TO GET UP BEFORE SUNRISE FOR WORK 
AT THIS TIME OF HERE YOU HAVE TO GET UP AROUND FIVE O'CLOCK 
PUT BREAKFAST ON AND BE ON MY WAY OUT FOR AT THE LATEST HALF PAST SIX 
I LOVE SWATTING FLIES 
ALTHOUGH IT'S REMOTE WHERE THEY LIVE 
BOB'S NOT HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING WORK 
IN FOUR AND A HALF YEARS I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY GOT TO THE POINT WHERE I HAVEN'T GOT ANY WORK 
BEFORE I'VE FINISHED ONE JOB I'VE ALWAYS FOUND ANOTHER 
HELLO ANDY 
ANDY IS BOB'S NEW BUILDING PARTNER 
HOW YOU DOING MATEY 
THERE'S BEEN A REAL BIG INFLUX OF PEOPLE OUT HERE 
IT'S RUMOURED THAT THERE'S NEARLY A FIFTY TO FIFTY BALANCE HERE 
OF ENGLISH AND SPANISH PEOPLE 
HUGE AMOUNT OF ENGLISH PEOPLE OUT HERE 
I THINK WE OUGHT TO SEND MOST OF THEM BACK JUST KEEP THE GOOD UNS 
THE HUGE INFLUX OF BRITS INTO NEW BUILD HOUSES 
HAS PROVIDED BOB WITH AN ENDLESS SUPPLY OF WORK LAYING PATIOS 
CAREFUL CAREFUL GOT ME PHONE AH 
SORRY BOSS 
YOU'RE ALL GOBBY YOU'RE DISGUSTING 
TRACY'S MOVED ON FROM HER DAYS AS AN AVON LADY 
SHE'S NEVER SHORT OF COMPANY 
YOU NEVER LONELY UP HERE THERE'S TOO MANY ANIMALS UP HERE 
I PREFER THE COMPANY OF THE ANIMALS 
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TRACY HAS GAINED A REPUTATION IN THE AREA 
AS AN ANIMAL LOVER AND AS A POTENTIAL HOME FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S UNWANTED PETS 
WE'VE GOT FIVE CATS 
I HAD FOURTEEN SO THAT'S NOT BAD I'VE GOT RID OF A FEW 
BUT AS FAST AS YOU HOME ONE ANOTHER ONE ARRIVES 
OH SPIT NO 
I TOLD YOU TO MOVE LOOK AT THE STATE OF YOU 
BOB'S ON HIS WAY HOME FROM WORK 
I LOVE IT I JUST LIKE DRIVING ROUND THESE ROADS 
BUT THE MOUNTAIN ROADS CAN BE TREACHEROUS AS BOB HAS DISCOVERED 
I STOPPED IN THE BAR AND HAD A DRINK WITH SOME FRIENDS 
AND AS I DROVE DOWN THE ROAD TOWARDS THE HOUSE 
THERE'S A BIG RUT IN THE ROAD 
CLIPPED IT AND IT BLEW THE BACK TYRE OUT OF MY VAN 
ALMOST BEFORE I KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
IT WAS GOING OVER THE EDGE IT JUST 
THAT'S THE ONE I LIKE 
BOB IN PAIN THAT'S A GOOD ONE 
HE'S DONE IT FIVE TIMES 
BUT ONLY FOUR TIMES HE WAS IN THE CAR I WANTED TO KILL HIM 
I WANTED TO PUNCH HIS FACE IN COS I WAS REALLY ANGRY THAT HE'D DONE IT AGAIN 
THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE MY LEG OFF AT THE KNEE 
IT WAS SEVERED IT WAS ONLY HELD ON BY A TINY LITTLE BIT 
IT WAS ONLY HIS WAGE COMING IN 
AND THEN HE CAN'T GO TO WORK FOR MONTHS BECAUSE HE WAS LAID UP 
SO IT COSTS US A LOT OF MONEY EVERY TIME HE DOES THAT 
IT COST US OUR NEW ROOF ACTUALLY FOR OUR HOUSE 
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE HOUSE FROM HERE HAS STILL GOT THE ORIGINAL ROOF 
IT LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE 
AND WE'D GOT JUST ABOUT THE MONEY PUT ASIDE TO PUT A NEW ROOF ON IT 
THIS TIME IT WAS THE ROOF 
PREVIOUS ACCIDENTS HAVE MEANT OTHER IMPROVEMENTS 
LIKE MAINS ELECTRICITY HAVE ALSO BEEN SHELVED 
IT WAS DOWN ABOUT HERE SOMEWHERE 
WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE ACCIDENT THE STAKES WERE HIGHER 
AS IT WAS UNCLEAR THAT BOB WOULD BE ABLE TO RETURN TO BUILDING WORK 
I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF US IT WAS QUITE SCARY 
I WAS DESPONDENT FOR A WHILE 
I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS GOING TO CARRY ON 
IT FORCED US INTO SOMETHING THAT I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE 
WITHOUT THE ACCIDENT AND THEN IT BECAME A NECESSITY 
WITH NO MONEY COMING IN THE FAMILY HAD TO FIND A WAY OF EARNING CASH 
TRACY CAME TO THE RESCUE WITH THE IDEA OF BUILDING A BOARDING KENNELS 
WHEN YOU'RE BEHIND HER SHE SORT OF JUMPS 
WITH LOTS OF BRITS IN THE AREA 
TRACY'S DISCOVERED IT'S A LUCRATIVE BUSINESS 
LOOKING AFTER PEOPLE'S PETS AND SHE'S FULL TO CAPACITY 
WE'D NEVER HEARD OF TRACY BEFORE BUT NOW WE'VE HEARD OF TRACY 
EVERYONE SAYS YOU CAN'T BEAT TRACY SHE'S THE BEST IN THE AREA 
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY DOG 
I DON'T THINK BOB WAS CONVINCED IT WAS A GOOD IDEA 
BUT HE'S HAD TO EAT HIS WORDS BECAUSE SINCE THEY'VE BEEN BUILT 
IT'S BEEN MAD 
I'M QUITE PLEASED WITH IT 
BUT NOW BECAUSE IT'S GONE SO MAD I WANT TO MAKE IT LEGAL 
GETTING AN OFFICIAL LICENCE CAN ONLY HAPPEN ONCE THEY'VE MADE 
MORE IMPROVEMENTS TO MEET OFFICIAL STANDARDS 
COSTING THEM MORE MONEY 
IF I DON'T GET MY LICENCE I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT 
BULGARIA HERE WE COME 
WE'LL BE OFF 
AND THERE ARE OTHER DOWNSIDES TO THE KENNEL BUSINESS 
I SHOULD HAVE A DEGREE IN POOP REALLY 
BECAUSE IF I'M NOT PICKING UP DOG POOP IT'S CAT POOP 
SHEEP POOP GOAT POOP HORSE POOP I'M ALWAYS PICKING UP SOME SORT OF POOP 
JAMES IS ALWAYS AMAZED HOW I KNOW EXACTLY WHO DID IT 
NOT ALL OF THE ORIGINAL BUSINESS PARTNERS ARE STILL TRYING TO SCRAPE A LIVING IN SPAIN 
SIMON JENNY AND TERRY ARE BACK IN THE U. K. 
BUT THEY DIDN'T RETURN HOME ALONE 
IF WE CAN CONTAIN THEM 
FUDGE WHERE'S FUDGE 
OUT OF THE THIRTEEN CATS THAT WE'VE GOT 
ELEVEN ARE SPANISH AND BROUGHT BACK FROM SPAIN WITH THEIR PASSPORTS 
WE LOST RAMBO 
SHE HAD A LIVER CONDITION 
THEY ARE OUR LITTLE CHILDREN I KNOW THAT IT SOUNDS SILLY 
FOR GROWN PEOPLE WE'LL GET KIDDED FOR THAT LATER 
WE WOULDN'T LEAVE THEM ABANDON THEM THEY ARE PART OF THE FAMILY 
AND I DON'T LIKE CATS THAT MUCH 
THE AVERY FAMILY KNEW EARLY ON THAT THEY WANTED TO RETURN HOME 
BUT THEY HAVE SINCE MADE A STARTLING DISCOVERY 
ABOUT THE ORIGINAL MOVE TO SPAIN 
WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO IT NONE OF US ACTUALLY WANTED TO LEAVE ENGLAND 
BUT WE NEVER SPOKE ABOUT IT 
SO WE ALL ASSUMED THAT THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE WANTED TO GO 
SO WE WAS ALL DOING IT FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE 
THE FATAL ERROR 
WHILST STILL IN SPAIN THE ONLY WAY THE FAMILY COULD AFFORD 
TO RETURN HOME WAS TO FINISH RESTORATION WORK ON THEIR HOUSE 
BUT MONEY BECAME VERY TIGHT 
FUNDS COMPLETELY RAN OUT 
AND THE HOUSE MUST HAVE BEEN I GUESS SIXTY FIVE PER CENT DONE 
THERE WAS NO OPTIONS 
ONE OF US HAD TO GO BACK TO ENGLAND AND WORK TO MAINTAIN THE BILLS 
THAT WAS MY BIGGEST LOW POINT THAT I WAS GETTING ON A PLANE 
TO COME BACK TO ENGLAND TO WORK 
AND JENNY AND TERRY WEREN'T COMING WITH ME 
WITH SIMON WORKING IN ENGLAND TO PAY FOR MATERIALS 
JENNY AND TERRY TOOK ANOTHER YEAR TO PUT 
THE FINISHING TOUCHES ON THE HOUSE AND MANAGED TO SELL IT FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
JUST BEFORE THE NEIGHBOURS STARTED BUILDING IN FRONT OF THEIR VIEWS OVER THE VALLEY 
I THINK WE'VE DONE QUITE WELL 
WE HAVE COME BACK WITH MORE THAN WE WENT WITH 
THERE WAS A FEAR THAT WE WERE GOING TO COME BACK PENNILESS 
THAT WASN'T AN OPTION FOR US NOT WITH THE AMOUNT OF PETS WE'VE GOT 
FOUR YEARS ON AND THE WOODS STILL DON'T HAVE MAINS ELECTRICITY 
A NEW ROOF OR A PHONE LINE 
AND TRACY IS THINKING ABOUT HER OPTIONS 
BULGARIA'S CHEAP TO GET SOMETHING SIMPLE LIKE THE ELECTRIC IN 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO MUCH MONEY 
AND WE AIN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT DONE IN THE NEAR FUTURE 
AND I'M FED UP LIVING IN A HOUSE WITH NO ELECTRIC 
YOU KNOW 
IN BULGARIA FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE 
WE CAN HAVE A HOUSE WITH FLAT LAND THAT'S GOT IT ALL 
BUT TO EVEN THINK ABOUT SELLING THEY NEED THEIR PAPERWORK IN ORDER 
ALTHOUGH THEY'VE BEEN LIVING IN THEIR HOUSE FOR FIVE YEARS NOW 
BOB AND TRACY ARE STILL UNCERTAIN WHAT THEY'VE BOUGHT 
SO WHAT DO WE ACTUALLY OWN 
FROM THAT TREE TO THAT TREE THERE 
THE SECOND TREE DOWN 
I THOUGHT WE OWNED DOWN TO THAT TREE 
NO 
THE HOUSE WAS PART OF AN EIGHT ACRE PLOT OF LAND 
BUT JOE WHO SOLD IT TO THEM TOLD THEM IT COULD BE OFFICIALLY SPLIT 
OR SEGREGATED INTO TWO SEPARATE PLOTS 
HE SOLD THEM THE SMALLER ONE WITH THE HOUSE 
WE WERE TOLD THAT IT COULD BE SEGREGATED 
BUT FIVE YEARS DOWN THE LINE IT HASN'T BEEN DONE 
AND THERE OBVIOUSLY SEEMS TO BE SOME 
THERE'S A PROBLEM 
OH LOOK THE CAT'S HAVING A PISS 
IT'S TERRIBLE IT'S LIKE A GIANT LATRINE MY HOUSE 
WE SHOULD JUST REGISTER IT AS THE BOG HOLE 
THEY'RE WORRIED BECAUSE THEY'VE DISCOVERED THAT THEY MAY NOT ACTUALLY OWN THEIR HOME 
THE DEEDS ARE STILL IN THE NAME OF A SCOTTISH COUPLE CALLED THE KEMPS 
AND THE NAMES CAN'T BE CHANGED UNLESS THE LAND SEGREGATION IS APPROVED BY THE TOWN HALL 
ARE THE KEMPS STILL ON THE PAPERWORK 
HAS JOE ALREADY CHANGED IT 
JOE MIGHT HAVE ALREADY CHANGED IT 
NO JOE NEVER GOT THE TITLE DEEDS SIGNED AT THE TOWN HALL 
IT'S NOT A LEGAL DOCUMENT AS SUCH 
THE TROUBLE IS BOB IF YOU DROVE OFF THAT MOUNTAIN AGAIN NEXT WEEK 
AND KILLED YOURSELF WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO 
I HAVEN'T EVEN GOT THE HOUSE LEGAL 
THE ONLY PROBLEM ARISES IS IF LIKE YOU SAID YOU NEED TO SELL 
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SELL QUICKLY 
JOE CAN TAKE IT AWAY FROM US BUT THE KEMPS MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
IT IS THEIR HOUSE NO IT IS NOT THEIR HOUSE 
IT'S THEIR HOUSE UNTIL THEY SIGN THE PAPERWORK TO SAY THEY SOLD IT 
WE'LL SEE WHEN WE GO AND SEE THE SOLICITOR 
HOPEFULLY SHE'LL PUT US WISE TO WHATEVER ISSUES WE'VE GOT 
IT'S ALL A LITTLE CHALLENGE INNIT 
IS IT A BIG PAIN IN THE ARSE 
NO WAY A LITTLE CHALLENGE 
YEAH BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO CHANGE IT YEAH O. K. 
TRACY'S SON JAMES IS NOW SEVENTEEN 
BUT AFTER FIVE YEARS UP A SPANISH MOUNTAIN HE'S FEELING MORE ISOLATED THAN EVER 
I HAVE NEVER REALLY MADE ANY SPANISH FRIENDS 
QUITE A SHAME REALLY 
I WOULD DEFINITELY BE DIFFERENT IF I HAD STAYED IN ENGLAND AND GOT MYSELF AN EDUCATION 
WHEN I WENT TO THE SECONDARY SCHOOL I WASN'T LEARNING ANYTHING 
I WAS GETTING FED UP GOING TO SCHOOL AND HAVING PEOPLE TRYING TO START FIGHTS 
SO I THOUGHT I MIGHT AS WELL LEAVE AND TRY AND GET SOME WORK 
THE WORK THAT IS ABOUT IS ALL BUILDING WORK 
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT WORK FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY 
I JUST CAN'T MAKE A LIVING OUT HERE FOR THIRTY EUROS A DAY IT JUST CANNOT BE DONE 
SO SPAIN'S CERTAINLY NOT THE PLACE TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE IN 
DEFINITELY NOT 
SINCE JAMES'S BIKE BROKE DOWN HE'S BEEN STRANDED 
FOUR HOUR'S WALK FROM THE NEAREST VILLAGE AND HE ONLY HAS HIS MUM FOR COMPANY 
I THINK SHE'LL MISS ME 
I'LL JUST SEND A POSTCARD EVERY NOW AND AGAIN 
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT 
RATHER THAN BEING STUCK UP A MOUNTAIN ALL DAY GO BACK AND ENJOY MYSELF FOR ONCE 
PLAY IN A FAMOUS HEAVY METAL BAND AND HAVE MILLIONS AND OWN A COUPLE OF FRENCH ISLANDS SOMEWHERE 
THAT WILL PROBABLY NEVER HAPPEN BUT YOU CAN DREAM 
ALL HE'S WAITING FOR NOW IS HIS PASSPORT AND THERE'S ONE THING JAMES CERTAINLY ISN'T GOING TO MISS 
IT WILL BE NICE TO BE IN A HOUSE WHERE YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CAT WAVING ITS BUM IN YOUR FACE 
NEW CHAPTER IN THE ADVENTURE OF THE WOODS 
TRACY'S ALSO KEEN TO MOVE OFF THE MOUNTAIN 
BUT IF BULGARIA IS GOING TO BE AN OPTION 
THEY NEED TO SORT OUT THE PROBLEM WITH THEIR DEEDS OR ESCRITORA 
SARAH A FRIEND OF THEIRS IS TAKING THEM TO SEE A LOCAL SOLICITOR MERCEDES 
THAT'S A PRIVATE CONTRACT THAT'S BETWEEN BOB AND TRACY AND JOE 
WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN IS FINDING OUT 
WHETHER WE CAN GET THE HOUSE PUT UNDER ESCRITORA IN OUR NAME AND HOW DIFFICULT IT'S GOING TO BE 
SO THIS MEANS THAT HE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEGREGATE 
IT'S JOE'S RESPONSIBILITY NOW TO GET THIS DONE 
YES BUT WHETHER OR NOT HE DOES 
I'M NOT GIVING HIM NO MORE MONEY O. K. THANK YOU 
IT SEEMS THERE IS A SOLUTION BUT ONE THAT WILL COST THEM THOUSANDS OF EUROS TO SORT OUT 
AFTER FIVE YEARS OF WAITING FOR JOE TO SORT THE DEEDS 
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING THEMSELVES 
BOB WILL HAVE TO WORK HARDER THAN EVER 
BOB'S ON HIS WAY TO WORK BUT THERE'S A NEW PROBLEM 
THE TENSIONER ON THE CAM BELT HAS BROKEN IT'S JUST ABOUT BLOWN THE ENGINE UP I'M AFRAID 
UNTIL I SORT SOMETHING I'M GOING TO BE NOT WORKING NOT BE EARNING ANY MONEY 
THAT'S NO GOOD REALLY CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT FOR VERY LONG 
OH DEAR I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE GO FROM THERE REALLY 
EVERYTHING BREAKS AT ONCE IT JUST BUGGERS YOU UP 
IT'S ALL RIGHT EARNING ENOUGH TO LIVE BUT YOU HAVE TO EARN ENOUGH TO REPLACE THINGS WHEN THEY BREAK 
AND WE DON'T EARN ENOUGH TO DO THAT AS WELL 
O. I. LEAVE SOME GRAVEL IN THE DOG PEN 
ALL THAT DIGGING 
SHAME YOU CAN'T SELL DOG SHIT INNIT 
I'D BE A MILLIONAIRE 
GORDON BENNETT 
I NOT ONLY TREAD IN THE SHIT I GET TO SIT IN IT AS WELL 
O. I. 
PUPPY STOP IT 
IT'S MORNING AND BOB IS HAVING A MORE LEISURELY BREAKFAST THAN USUAL 
SO ARE YOU WORKING NEXT WEEK 
I AM WORKING 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY 
AND WEDNESDAY 
I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING ON AFTER THAT 
IT'S ALL GONE A BIT QUIET 
THERE HAS BEEN A SHARP DOWNTURN IN THE SPANISH PROPERTY MARKET 
BROUGHT ON BY A GOVERNMENT CRACKDOWN ON ILLEGAL HOUSE BUILDING 
AND STORIES ABOUT BOUGHT HOMES BEING DEMOLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT HAVE STOPPED BRITS BUYING 
BOB'S WORK HAS DRIED UP 
AND ANY CHANCE OF PAYING THE SOLICITOR TO MAKE THEIR DEEDS LEGAL IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE REMOTE 
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WE CAN DO BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO IT 
IF WE'VE GOT ENOUGH MONEY PUT ASIDE AT SOME POINT TO DO THE SEGREGATION WE'LL CARRY ON AND DO IT OURSELVES 
THE ORIGINAL IDEA WAS THAT IF WE SOLD THIS HERE WE COULD GO TO BULGARIA 
AND AFFORD TO HAVE THE THINGS WE HAVEN'T GOT HERE 
WE COULDN'T SELL THIS PLACE WITHOUT THE ESCRITORA ANYWAY 
I'M QUITE HAPPY HERE I LOVE IT 
AND YOU LIKE IT DON'T YOU 
IT'S LIKE BEING ON HOLIDAY INNIT WE PUT THE KETTLE ON THIS MORNING AND THE TAP FELL OFF IN OUR HANDS 
IT'S LIKE CAMPING ISN'T IT I DUNNO NORMALLY YOU HAVE BETTER FACILITIES AT A CAMPSITE 
AT LEAST AT THE CAMPSITE YOU'VE GOT HOT WATER 
AND ELECTRIC AND A ROOF 
IT'S ALL GOOD FUN INNIT YEAH 
WITH BOB OUT OF WORK IT'S CRUCIAL TO GET THE KENNELS ON A LEGAL FOOTING AND ENSURE THEIR INCOME 
OH CHARMING 
TO QUALIFY FOR A LICENCE THEY NEED TO PUT IN A RECEPTION AREA WITH TOILET FACILITIES 
BUT BOB HAS HAD AN IDEA ABOUT HOW TO INSTALL ONE AT A FRACTION OF THE COST 
WE'VE GOT SO MUCH STUFF IN HERE 
IT'S BEEN USED AS A TOOL SHED FOR MY TOOLS 
THIS WAS THE TOILET FOR THE JOURNEY OVER AND PRETTY MUCH FOR THE FIRST 
SIX WEEKS THAT WE WERE HERE IT'S FILTHY DIRTY THAT'S THE ONLY THING 
OH IT'S MOULD THAT'S WHAT IT IS THAT WILL DO THE JOB 
TECHNICALLY IT'S A TOILET FACILITY 
THEIR NEW RECEPTION IS THE CARAVAN THEY BOUGHT FOR FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE YEARS AGO FOR THEIR JOURNEY TO SPAIN 
JAMES 
ALL THIS STUFF LAYING ON THE CARAVAN HAS GOT TO BE SHIFTED WE'VE GOT TO GET IN TO THE JACK 
THE CARAVAN HASN'T BEEN MOVED SINCE THEY ARRIVED
