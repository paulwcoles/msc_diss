AND FOR MONDAY IT'S ALL ABOUT SOME REALLY HEAVY RAIN AND SOME HAIL 
THE COLUMNS OF CLOUDS INTRODUCE THOSE STORMS ACROSS THE U. K. 
THERE WAS PRETTY HEFTY SHOWERS AROUND AND SOME SPELLS OF RAIN 
THAT'S THE WAY WE TAKE OURSELVES INTO THE FIRST PART OF MONDAY 
PERSISTENT RAIN EASING ITSELF UP THE EASTERN SIDE OF SCOTLAND 
RAIN TOO ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE WEST OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
ESSENTIALLY A MILD NIGHT 
WE START MONDAY WITH PLENTY OF RAIN ACROSS NORTH AND EAST SCOTLAND 
DOWN TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST DRIER CONDITIONS WITH A CHANCE OF SUN 
VERY LITTLE SUNSHINE TO START YOUR DAY ACROSS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
PERSISTENT RAIN HERE NOT SHOWERS 
THE BEST SUNSHINE IN THE MIDLANDS EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST 
AS WE MOVE OUT TOWARDS THE WEST WE INCREASE THE CHANCES OF SHOWERS 
THEY'RE THERE RIGHT FROM THE WORD GO ACROSS NORTH DEVON AND CORNWALL 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE BRISTOL CHANNEL 
CLOUDY CONDITIONS WITH RAIN ACROSS NORTH WALES 
AND A RATHER DULL START TO THE DAY FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
WITH SHOWERS AND SPELLS OF RAIN 
ON THROUGH THE DAY ON MONDAY ALWAYS WE'LL KEEP THIS AREA OF RAIN 
ACROSS NORTH EAST SCOTLAND AND SEE AFTER THAT BRIGHT START 
HOW PREVALENT THOSE SHOWERS BECOME ACROSS THE MIDLANDS AND SOUTH EAST 
WON'T STOP TEMPERATURES CLIMBING TO SIXTEEN MAYBE SEVENTEEN DEGREES 
FURTHER NORTH EVEN ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE PENNINES 
AFTER THAT FAIRLY DULL START YOU MAY GET BREAKS IN BETWEEN SHOWERS 
SHOWERS ACROSS CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SCOTLAND AND THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
PERSISTENT RAIN IN FAR NORTH SCOTLAND AND AFTER THAT DULL START 
THERE WILL BE GLIMPSES OF SUNSHINE ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
TOWARDS WALES AND SOUTH WEST ENGLAND 
IT'S THAT MIXTURE OF SUNNY SPELLS AND SOME SHOWERS 
MIGHT HEAR AN ODD RUMBLE OF THUNDER 
AND AGAIN IF YOU CAN TUCK YOURSELF AWAY FROM THE BREEZE 
YOU'LL FIND TWELVE THIRTEEN DEGREES IS DISTINCTLY POSSIBLE 
INTO TUESDAY YOU'LL SEE THAT SHOWERS TEND TO DIE AWAY 
THAT RAIN MOVING AWAY FROM THE FAR NORTH OF SCOTLAND 
BUT MORE RAIN IN THE SOUTH WEST 
THIS HERALDS THE ARRIVAL OF A VERY WET TUESDAY FOR ENGLAND AND WALES 
AN AREA OF CLOUD AND RAIN SWEEPS NORTH 
THERE WILL BE SHOWERS IF NOT RAIN IN SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY ACROSS THE NORTH OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
OR IN THE SOUTH DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE 
BE PREPARED FOR SOME SHARP SHOWERS IF NOT LONGER SPELLS OF RAIN 
TEMPERATURES JUST ABOUT THE SEASONAL AVERAGE 
I TOLD YOU IT LOOKED LIKE AN UNSETTLED WEEK MORE ON THE WEB 
FROM ME I WISH YOU A GOOD NIGHT
