NICE SHOW BEFORE THAT THOUGH HERE'S SAM SPARRO 
MMM 
THE FISH SWAM OUT OF THE OCEAN 
AND GREW LEGS AND THEY STARTED WALKING 
AND THE APES CLIMBED DOWN FROM THE TREES 
AND GREW TALL AND THEY STARTED TALKING 
AND THE STARS FELL OUT OF THE SKY 
AND MY TEARS ROLLED INTO THE OCEAN 
NOW I'M LOOKING FOR A REASON WHY 
YOU EVEN SET MY WORLD INTO MOTION 
COS IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE 
THEN THE STARS DON'T EVEN MATTER 
NOW I'M FILLED TO THE TOP WITH FEAR 
BUT IT'S ALL JUST A BUNCH OF MATTER 
COS IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE 
THEN I DON'T WANT TO BE EITHER 
I WANNA BE NEXT TO YOU 
BLACK AND GOLD 
BLACK AND GOLD 
BLACK AND GOLD 
M. M. M. 
I LOOKED UP INTO THE GREY SKY 
AND SEE A THOUSAND EYES STARING BACK 
AND ALL AROUND THESE GOLDEN BEACONS 
I SEE NOTHING BUT BLACK 
I FEEL THE WEIGHT OF SOMETHING BEYOND THEM 
I DON'T SEE WHAT I CAN FEEL 
IF VISION IS THE ONLY VALIDATION 
THEN MOST OF MY LIFE ISN'T REAL 
COS IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE 
THEN THE STARS DON'T EVEN MATTER 
NOW I'M FILLED TO THE TOP WITH FEAR 
BUT IT'S ALL JUST A BUNCH OF MATTER 
COS IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE 
THEN I DON'T WANT TO BE EITHER 
I WANNA BE NEXT TO YOU 
BLACK AND GOLD 
BLACK AND GOLD 
BLACK AND GOLD 
BLACK AND GOLD 
BLACK AND GOLD 
BLACK AND GOLD 
OH OH 
OH OH OH 
COS IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE 
THEN THE STARS DON'T EVEN MATTER 
NOW I'M FILLED TO THE TOP WITH FEAR 
BUT IT'S ALL JUST A BUNCH OF MATTER 
COS IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE 
THEN I DON'T WANT TO BE EITHER 
I WANNA BE NEXT TO YOU

OR ON DRUGS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
IT'S REALLY NICE HAVING A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CROWD 
WHERE THE CROWD KIND OF INVADE THE STAGE 
WHEN YOU SEE CROWD SURFING YOU SEE SWEATY PUNTERS
