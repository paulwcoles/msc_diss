WELL AFTER YESTERDAY'S SUNSHINE IT'S A FINE CLEAR NIGHT TONIGHT 
AND THAT LEADS US INTO ANOTHER LOVELY DAY TODAY 
PLENTY MORE SUNSHINE OUT THERE 
THOUGH THERE WILL BE JUST A SCATTERING OF SHOWERS 
RIGHT NOW THE U. K. IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
IT'S THIS AREA OF CLEAR SKY OVER THE NORTH SEA 
THERE IS SOME PATCHY CLOUD OUT THERE ACROSS THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND 
THAT'LL STICK AROUND OVERNIGHT KEEPING IT A BIT GREY 
FOR THE MORAY COAST AND THE EASTERN COAST OF SCOTLAND 
AND THROUGH THE SMALL HOURS OF THIS MORNING 
YOU SEE SOME MIST AND FOG DEVELOPING THROUGHT THE VALE OF YORK 
AND THE LOWLANDS OF SCOTLAND SEVEN OR EIGHT DEGREES FOR NEWCASTLE AND GLASGOW 
TWELVE OR THIRTEEN FOR CARDIFF AND LONDON 
A LOVELY START IN WALES NOT PARTICULARLY WINDY 
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TEMPERATURES ALREADY INTO DOUBLE FIGURES 
SIMILARLY A FINE SUNNY AND WARM START IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
MOST OF SCOTLAND TOO SEEING SOME MORNING SUNSHINE 
BUT SOME EARLY MIST AND FOG FOR SOME NORTHERN AND EASTERN COASTS 
A LOT WILL BURN AWAY QUICKLY BUT WILL BE MORE STUBBORN 
THROUGH THE CENTRAL LOWLANDS BUT THAT TOO WILL CLEAR AWAY 
THE MIST AND FOG CLEARING READILY FROM THE VALE OF YORK 
JOINING WITH THE REST OF NORTHERN ENGLAND WITH FINE AND SUNNY SKIES 
SOUTHERN ENGLAND IT'S A LOVELY START THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN DEGREES 
WITH TEMPERATURES RISING QUICKLY IN THE MORNING SUNSHINE 
THE WINDS WILL NOT BE PARTICULARLY STRONG 
SO A LOVELY START FOR MOST OF US 
AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY SOME CLOUD WILL DEVELOP 
CHIEFLY THROUGH THE MIDLANDS PARTS OF WALES AND THE NORTHWEST 
AND HERE WE WILL SEE A SCATTERING OF SHOWERS DEVELOPING 
A FEW SHARP SHOWERS ARE LIKELY ACROSS THE HILLS OF WALES 
LIGHTER SHOWERS THROUGH THE MIDLANDS EVEN THESE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN 
MOST PLACES FINE AND WARM TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY THREE DEGREES 
PROBABLY A NOTCH UP ON TODAY'S VALUES 
BUT STILL QUITE COOL ALONG THE NORTH SEA COAST 
THE WIND COMING IN FROM THE SEA 
AN ODD SHOWER IN SOUTH WEST SCOTLAND BUT MOST PLACES FINE AND SUNNY 
SEVENTEEN IN ABERDEEN MAYBE A TWENTY ONE IN GLASGOW 
THAT'S SEVENTY FARENHEIT AS YOU'LL FIND IN A SUNNY NORTHERN IRELAND 
A FEW SHARP SHOWERS ACROSS THE HILLS OF WALES BUT 
FOR CARDIFF PROBABLY STAYING DRY AND QUITE WARM AT TWENTY TWO DEGREES 
TWENTY ONE IN PLYMOUTH AGAIN THAT'S SEVENTY FARENHEIT 
RIGHT THE WAY ALONG THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND 
SHOULD BE A FINE AFTERNOON IF ANYTHING A TOUCH WARMER THAN TODAY 
BUT STILL WE'VE GOT THAT POTENTIALLY GUSTY BREEZE 
SHOWERS FADE AWAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
IT'LL BE A LOVELY END TO THE DAY WITH BLUE SKY FOR MANY 
AND CLEAR SKIES INTO THURSDAY MORNING 
TEMPERATURES THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN DEGREES 
IN CARDIFF AND LONDON FIRST THING ON THURSDAY 
INTO SINGLE FIGURES FURTHER NORTH 
BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF SUNSHINE FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTH EASTERN ENGLAND 
DOWN IN THE SOUTH AND WEST A BIT OF A CHANGE 
SOME CLOUD AND A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN MOVING IN 
BY FRIDAY THAT AREA OF RAIN WILL BE AFFECTING MUCH OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
WALES THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
BY SATURDAY THOUGH IT SHOULD BE BEGINNING TO BRIGHTEN UP 
FURTHER SOUTH FRIDAY QUITE GREY FOR WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN BUT AGAIN THINGS ARE LOOKING BRIGHTER BY SATURDAY 
LONDON STILL WARM TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY THREE DEGREES 
MORE AS EVER ON THE WEBSITE 
PLAN'S GOOD 
MO I'M IN 
BOYS ARE BRIEFED 
AND HASN'T HE GOT A SAFE 
ABOUT AS SUBTLE AS A FLYING BRICK 
WAH AH AH 
WE'LL BE FINE YEAH I CAN DO THESE WITH ME EYES SHUT 
DO THE JOB WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A HITCH 
ARE YOU SURE 
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING 
IS IT ALWAYS WRONG TO LIE ABSOLUTELY
