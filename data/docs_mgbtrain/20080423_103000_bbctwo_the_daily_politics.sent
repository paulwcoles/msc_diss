GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO THE DAILY 
POLITICS WE WERE PROMISED A CHANGE 
OF TUNE BUT ACTUALLY IT'S THE SAME 
OLD ROUTINE GORDON BROWN IS 
STRUGGLING TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD 
ABOVE THE MURMURS OF CABINET 
INFIGHTING AND THE BOOS FROM THE 
AUDIENCE WE'LL BE LOOKING AT HOW 
MUCH LONGER HIS PERFORMANCE CAN 
LAST SPARE TEN PENCE FOR YOUR 
THOUGHTS THERE IS ALL TO PLAY FOR 
AT PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS WITH 
THAT TAX ROW GOING ON HOW WILL 
GORDON BROWN DO WE'LL HAVE ALL THE 
ACTION LIVE WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE 
TAKEN ON DARFUR WE'LL BE SPEAKING 
TO A FORMER CHILD SOLDIER HE'S NOW 
A BEST SELLING RAP SINGER EMMANUEL 
JAL DO YOU KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS 
THEY DO AT DOWNING STREET WE'LL 
FIND OUT WHAT SAINT GEORGE'S DAY MEANS 
TO YOU AND 
OUR POLITICIANS OUR USUAL WEDNESDAY PROGRAMME IN 
WHICH WE HAVE A PLATTER OF 
TRADITIONAL ENGLISH BLIGHTS 
DELIGHTS FOR YOU WE HAVE PATRICIA 
HEWITT AND THE GENTLE MAN FROM 
TWICKENHAM THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT 
VINCE THE CABLE WELCOME TO BOTH OF 
YOU GOOD TO SEE YOU AS WE CAME ON 
AIR WE LEARNED THAT THE CHANCELLOR 
IS GOING TO ISSUE A WRITTEN 
STATEMENT IT COULD BE BEING DONE 
AS WE SPEAK ON WHAT THE 
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE IS GOING TO 
BE TO THE LABOUR REBELLION OVER THE 
TEN PER CENT ABOLITION THE ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN PER CENT TAX BAND FOR LOW EARNERS AS 
YOU WILL KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A LOT 
OF UNREST NOT JUST IN THE COUNTRY 
BUT IN THE LABOUR PARTY ITSELF AND 
THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE 
CHANCELLOR HAVE COME UNDER GREAT 
PRESSURE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE TEN PER CENT 
BAND WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABOLISHED 
BUT THAT THE CHANCELLOR WILL 
OUTLINE SOME MEASURES THAT HE HOPES 
WILL AMELIORATE THE SITUATION AS 
SOON AS WE HERE YOU HEAR YOU 
WILL HEAR AS WELL THAT IS THE 
POLICY HERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE ATLANTIC BIG EVENTS HILLARY 
CLINTON'S FLAGGING BID TO BE THE 
CANDIDATE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE 
RECEIVED A REAL SHOT IN THE ARM 
VOTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA WHICH WERE 
EXPECTED TO VOTE FOR HER GIVE HER 
VICTORY BUT THEY GAVE HER A 
DECISIVE VICTORY OVER BARACK OBAMA 
SOME PEOPLE COUNTED ME OUT AND SAID 
TO DROP OUT BUT THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE WELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
DON'T QUIT AND THEY DESERVE A 
PRESIDENT WHO QUIT EITHER 
SO SHE DIDN'T JUST WIN BUT SHE 
WON BY AROUND TEN POINTS AND THAT 
IS ENOUGH TO KEEP THIS RACE WIDE 
OPEN ON NOW ON SIXTH 
TO INDIANA 
AND NORTH CAROLINA MAYBE ON TO THE 
CONFERENCE IN DENVER TECHICALLY 
SENT FOR BARACK OBAMA IS STILL THE 
ONE WITH THE MOST DELEGATES BUT 
IT'S ALL UP FOR GRABS NOW ISN'T 
IT 
YES IT IS I'VE BEEN IT SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON FROM THE 
OUTSET I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A WOMAN 
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT IN MY LIFETIME 
MORE THAN ARTICULATE AMERICAN 
PRESIDENT 
I THINK EVERYONE IS PRESIDENT WISHING THEM WELL AND THEY ARE TORN 
I UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKE IT FOR YOU 
FOR HILLARY CLINTON 
I'M A LONG 
TIME FEMINIST L. WANT TO SEE A 
WOMAN PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
I THINK SHE WOULD MAKE A VERY 
STRONG PRESIDENT L. THINK BARACK 
OBAMA BEING THAT MUCH YOUNGER HAS 
GOT THE TIME TO BE PRESIDENT IN A 
FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IT'S 
JUST TRAGIC THAT THEY ARE UP 
AGAINST EACH OTHER THEY ARE 
CRITICISING EACH OTHER AND GIVING 
THE REPUBLICANS AMMUNITION AT THIS 
STAGE IN THE CAMPAIGN 
AND OF 
COURSE IF THESE TWO DEMOCRATIC 
CONTENDERS VINCE CABLE CONTINUE 
TO SCRATCH EACH OTHER'S EYES OUT 
AND IT'S GETTING NASTY IF THEY DO 
THE REAL WINNER IN THIS IS A MAN 
CALLED JOHN MCCAIN WHO HAS THE 
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION 
THIS IS THE 
WORST POSSIBLE RESULT BECAUSE IT 
KEEPS IT GOING IT'S NOT JUST THAT 
IT KEEPS IT GOING BUT THEY ARE 
KNOCKING BITS OUT OF EACH OTHER AND 
DAMNING EACH OTHER HILLARY'S 
POSITION IN TERMS OF THE 
REPRESENTATION AND THE SELECTION 
PROCESS IS IN A WEAK POSITION AND 
WILL PROBABLY STILL LOSE BUT AS 
LONG AS HE STAYS THERE IT BECOMES 
MORE DIFFICULT FOR BARACK OBAMA TO 
BUILD UP CREDIBILITY IT WOULD BE 
GOOD TO HAVE A WOMAN PRESIDENT BUT 
SHE HAS BECOME BELITTLED BY THE 
PROCESS AND THE WAY SHE HAS 
CONDUCTED HERSELF AND THE ENDLESS 
FLIP FLOPPING ISSUES AND IT MAKES 
HER UNATTRACTIVE I'M A LABOUR RAL 
MINDED PERSON BUT IF I HAD TO 
CHOSE BETWEEN HER AND MCCAIN I 
WOULD VOTE FOR MCCAIN LIBERAL 
MINDED PERSON HE LOOKS A MORE 
ATTRACTIVE CANDIDATE AND I SUSPECT 
A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE FORMING THE 
SAME JUDGMENT IT'S ON TO SIXTH 
AND ON TO INDIANA NOT THE 
PRETTIEST STATE IN THE UNION AND 
THEN NORTH CAROLINA WHICH IS ONE 
OF THE PRETTIEST WE HAVE GONE FROM 
HERE TO THERE AND WE ARE BACK HERE 
AGAIN WE HAVE A LITTLE AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE SHOT OF WHAT THE 
CHANCELLOR IS PLANNING TO DO TO 
AMELIORATE THE RESULT OF THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PER CENT TAX BAND HE 
HAS CONFIRMED HE WILL LOOK AT THE 
WINTER FUEL BILLS TAX CREDITS AND 
THE MINIMUM WAGE IN ORDER TO 
COMPENSATE THOSE WHO ARE LOSING OUT 
FROM THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN PER CENT RATE 
OF INCOME THESE ARE THE HEADLINES 
WHEN WE GET MORE DETAILS WE'LL GO 
THROUGH THEM SOMETHING ON WINTER 
FUEL TAX CREDITS AND INMUM WAGE 
THE MAN WHO KNOWS THE BACKGROUND TO 
THIS AND WHY THE CHANCELLOR HAS 
CHOSEN THIS ROUTE IS OF COURSE NICK 
ROBINSON WELCOME 
GOOD MORNING 
GIVE US THE BACKGROUND TO THIS 
BEFORE THAT SHALL WE GIVE YOU THE 
HEADLINE 
YOU KNOW MORE HE ALWAYS HEADLINE DOES 
THIS IS A SCREECHING U. TURN DOES YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND OF POLITICAL 
TYRES THEY SAID SHE COULDN'T RE 
OPEN THE BUDGET AND THEY SAID 
PEOPLE WERE NOT LOSING AND THEY ARE 
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THEY ARE THEY 
SAID THEY DIDN'T NEED TO GIVE MONEY 
NOW THEY ARE NOT GIVING NOW BUT 
PROMISING IT WILL BE BACKDATED AND 
PEOPLE WILL GET THE MONEY WHAT I 
UNDERSTAND IS IN THE WRITTEN 
STATEMENT FROM THE CHANCELLOR 
THOUGH I HAVEN'T GOT THE TEXT IN 
FRONT OF ME IS THIS THAT HE SEEKS 
TO REASSURE LABOUR M. P.'S ON TWO 
FRONTS FIRST THAT HE'S NOT SIMPLY 
KICKING THINGS INTO THE LONG GRASS 
SECONDLY THEY DON'T HAVE TO HALT 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TEN PENCE 
SCRAPPED IN ORDER TO ENSURE PEOPLE 
DON'T LOSE MONEY IN OTHER WORDS 
THAT POINT ON BACKDATING HE GOES 
THROUGH AS I UNDERSTAND IT TWO 
TO SPECIFIC GROUPS OF PEOPLE HE 
BELIEVES MAY BE LOSERS THOSE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE PENSIONERS AND WHO 
ARE NOT BENEFITING FROM THE TAX 
CREDIT THAT GROUP HE SAYS HE 
WANTS TO ASSESS THEIR LOSSES AND 
ONE WAY IN WHICH HE MIGHT BE ABLE 
TO HELP IS THAT WINTER FUEL PAYMENT 
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO PROMISES THE 
SECOND GROUP IS SO CALLED CHILDLESS 
COUPLES PEOPLE WHO DON'T BENEFIT 
FROM THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
GIVES A LOT OF MONEY AND PEOPLE GOT 
A LOT MORE MONEY IN RECENT YEARS AS 
A RESULT OF THE WORKING TAX CREDITS 
CHILD BENEFIT AND OTHER HELP FOR 
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AND THERE 
HE LOOKS AS YOU WERE SAYING AT 
THE TWO AREAS THAT HE MIGHT BE ABLE 
TO HELP ON ONE OF WHICH IS THE 
MINIMUM WAGE FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE 
AND THE OTHER IS EXTENDING TAX 
CREDITS TO AFFECT PEOPLE WHO ARE 
CHILDLESS NOW AGAIN IF HE WANTED 
MONEY TODAY HE DOESN'T GIVE IT IF 
YOU WANT THE END OF THE SCRAPPING 
YOU DON'T GET IT BUT IF AS A 
LABOUR REBEL OR ANYBODY ELSE WHAT 
YOU WANTED TO HEAR WAS SOMETHING 
THIS FINANCIAL YEAR BACKDATE TODAY 
HELP GROUPS THAT'S WHAT HE'S JUST 
ANNOUNCED 
IT WILL BE BACKDATED ANNOUNCED THAT IS THE KEY THING IT ALSO 
THOUGH AND WE'LL COME ON TO THE 
POLITICS BUT IT GETS THE 
GOVERNMENT INTO A POSITION WHICH 
OFTEN INFURIATES PEOPLE WHICH IS 
IT IS TAKING WITH ONE HAND AND IT 
IS GOING TO TAKE MORE TAX FROM 
CERTAIN GROUPS BECAUSE THE 
STARTING RATE OF TAX GOES FROM TEN 
TO TWENTY PER CENT AND THEN THERE WILL BE A 
MASSIVE BUREAUCRACY AND FORM 
FILLING AND IT WILL BE DONE TO GIVE 
YOU THAT SAME MONEY BACK 
NOW SOME 
PEOPLE WILL ARGUE THAT IT WAS AN 
END OF BUREAUCRACY TO END THIS 
STAGGERED TAX SYSTEM AND THAT WAS A 
SIMPLIFICATION AND IT'S GOOD AND 
LOTS OF PEOPLE WILL BENEFIT THERE 
IS A SIMPLER WAY AS YOU ARE SORT OF 
HINTING AT TO HELP THIS GROUP OF 
PEOPLE WHICH WOULD BE TO JUST TAKE 
MORE PEOPLE OUT OF TAX TO RAISE 
THAT TAX ALLOWANCE 
WHY DON'T THEY 
DO THAT 
THERE IS AN INITIAL 
PROBLEM WITH THAT I'M SURE OUR EX 
MINISTER HERE AND VINCE CABLE WILL 
KNOW MORE OF THE DETAILS WHICH IS 
EVERYBODY BENEFITS IF YOU RAISE 
THE ALLOWANCE BUT WHAT YOU COULD 
DO FOR EXAMPLE IS RAISE THE TAX 
ALLOWANCE AND TAKE THE MONEY THAT 
WE NEED TO PAY FOR IT AWAY FROM 
PEOPLE ON TOP RATE TAX IT'S A WASH 
FOR THEM 
WHICH IS WHAT REAGAN DID 
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
THERE WILL BE AN 
ARGUMENT ABOUT WHAT HOW HE SHOULD 
DO T. BUT THE CRUCIAL THING WE 
SHOULD MARK THIS MORNING I THINK 
IS I WAS ON A TRIP WITH THE PRIME 
MINISTER ONLY LAST WEEK AND 
INTERVIEWED HIM THE WEEK BEFORE 
WHEN HE SPOKE THEN AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE IN THE INTERVIEW THAT HE 
ASKED TO DO WITH B. B. C. NEWS HE SAID 
WE ARE NOT BUDGING THAT WAS HIS 
MESSAGE TODAY HE BUDGED HE'S HE'S BUDGED IN QUITE A BIG WAY IT'S 
QUITE CLEAR THAT THE PRESSURE TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS TEN PER CENT BAND HAS 
BEEN SO ENORMOUS HE'S HAD TO RE 
OPEN WINTER FUEL AND THE TAX CREDIT 
AND RE OPENING THE MINIMUM WAGE 
THERE IS A SENSE THAT THEY'VE HAD 
TO MOVE A LONG WAY 
I HAVEN'T SEEN 
THE STATEMENT MYSELF AS I 
UNDERSTAND IT 
NONE OF US HAVE AS AS I UNDERSTAND IT THEY'VE BEEN 
WORKING ON THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME 
AND IT'S CLEARLY RIGHT THAT THEY DO 
SO 
THE PRIME MINISTER TOLD NICK SO ROBINSON IN THE UNITED STATES THAT 
THERE WAS NO NEED TO DO ANYTHING 
THAT THE ABOLITION WAS THE RIGHT 
THING TO DO AND THE CASE SIMPLY 
WASN'T BEING PUT FORWARD PROPERLY 
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE 
TREASURY HAVE IN FACT BEEN LOOKING 
AT SOME OF THE OPTIONS FOR SOME 
TIME LEAVING THAT ASIDE I THINK 
THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE RIGHT 
THINGS BECAUSE LIKE EVERY OTHER 
MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT I'VE HAD FOR 
INSTANCE PEOPLE IN THE EARLY SIXTIES 
PENSIONERS WHO DON'T BENEFIT FROM 
THE PENSION CREDIT WHO WOULD BE HIT 
BY THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN PENCE 
AND SAYING HANG ON WHAT IS THIS 
ABOUT I'M NOT WELL OFF L. NEED 
SOME HELP 
IT WAS BASICALLY A 
MISTAKE TO ABOLISH THIS RATE 
WITHOUT ANY DEBATE AT ALL IT WAS 
SNOOK OUT UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS 
NO NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT GETTING 
READY OF RID OF IT AND THIS IS 
THE CONSEQUENCE YOU HAVE TO RUSH 
INTO OTHER AREAS OF POLICY TO TRY 
TO MAKE AMENDS AND IN THE PROCESS 
MAKING THE TAX SYSTEM EVEN MORE 
COMPLICATED THAN IT ALREADY IS 
ACTUALLY LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WHERE 
ALL THIS STEMS FROM NOT ONLY 
ABOLISHED THE THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
AND MAKES IT SIMPLER BUT IT CUTS 
THE MAIN TAX RATE AND IT PUT A VERY 
BIG INCREASE INTO TAX CREDITS WITH 
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AND ANOTHER 
BIG INCREASE INTO TAX CREDITS FOR 
POORER PENSIONS 
AS YOU KNOW IN 
THE TREASURY RED BOOK THE 
GOVERNMENT MADE THE ASSUMPTION THAT 
THE TAKE UP RATE ON TAX CREDITS 
WOULD BE NO BIGGER THAN IT HAD BEEN 
BEFORE THEY WERE NOT PLANNING TO 
PAY OUT MORE THAN ORIGINALLY 
PLANNED THERE WAS A SLEIGHT OF 
HAND THERE SHOULD WE NOT THOSE 
WHO APPLY FOR THEM SHOULD WE NOT 
BE PRETTY CYNICAL ABOUT THIS THAT 
A TAX CHANGE THAT WAS RUSHED OUT 
WITHOUT ANY DEBATE WITHOUT ANY 
THOUGHT OF THE CONSEQUENCES NOW 
RESULTS IN THIS RATHER DRAMATIC 
STATEMENT WHICH WE SEE IS NOW 
GOING TO JOHN MCFALL THE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE 
FROM THE CHANCELLOR TO TINKER WITH 
OTHERS TO TRY TO MAKE AMENDS I'M I'M NOT THE TARGET AUDIENCE IT'S THE 
LABOUR BACKBENCHERS 
YOU ARE THE 
DEVIL WE HAVE 
THE PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WILL NOT BE IMPRESSED WHEN HE 
ANALYSE IT WHEN YOU TAKE IT IN 
TURN THE MINIMUM WAGE MAY WELL BE 
THE CASE FOR AN INCREASE ANYBODY 
IN THE TEN THOUSAND TO EIGHTEEN THOUSAND BRACKET 
WILL BE HIT BY THE CHANGES WE KNOW 
THAT TAX CREDITS ARE IDEALISTIC 
THEY ARE VERY COMPLICATED PEOPLE 
GET CAUGHT UP IN OVERPAYMENTS TWO TWO BILLION MADE TO PEOPLE WHO 
SHOULDN'T GET THEM 
THAT IS RIGHT 
THE SCENARIO THAT I THINK THEY 
SHOULD PURSUE IS THE SECOND ONE 
WHICH IS BASICALLY THAT IF YOU 
ARE GOING TO FINANCE TAX CUTS FOR 
THE PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM END THE 
WAY YOU DO IT IS TAKE MORE FROM THE 
TOP WHETHER IT IS CAPITAL GAINS 
TAX OR WHATEVER 
WE'LL HAVE A LOT 
MORE OF THIS AS THE PROGRAMME 
DEVELOPS IT'S A BIG DEVELOPMENT 
NICK A QUICK THOUGHT FROM YOU 
BEFORE WE MOVE ON 
WE NOW HAVE THE 
LETTER AND THE DETAIL IT'S NOT A 
WRITTEN STATEMENT IT'S A LETTER TO 
THE CHAIRMAN JOHN MCFALL HE HAS 
AN INQUIRY COMING UP THIS IS 
DELICIOUS PHRASE I THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO LET YOU KNOW 
THE WORK THE TREASURY HAS UNDER WAY 
IN THIS AREA I WONDER IF THEY 
COULD DO THAT EVERY WEEK THERE 
WILL BE PEOPLE WATCHING WHO WANT TO 
KNOW FRIENDS AND RELATIVES THIS 
IS NOT INDIVIDUAL COMPENSATION 
THEY WON'T SAY YOU NEIL DON'T LOSE 
THIS OR THAT MONEY IT'S ABOUT 
LOOKING AT GROUPS TWO GROUPS THAT 
HE MAKES CLEAR LOW PAID WORKERS 
WITHOUT CHILDREN AND PENSIONERS 
UNDER SIXTY FIVE HE SAID THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT ARE LOOKING AT 
PENSIONERS AS I SAID AT THE 
WINTER FUEL ALLOWANCE AND IN TERMS 
OF THOSE WITHOUT CHILDREN LOOKING 
AT POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE TAX 
CREDIT SYSTEM TO ALLOW THE AVERAGE 
LOSSES FROM THE REMOVAL OF THE TEN 
PENCE STARTING RATE OF INCOME TAX 
TO BE OFFSET AND ALSO ASK IN THE 
LOW PAY COMMISSION TO LOOK AT THE 
MINIMUM WAGE REGIME IF YOU ARE 
BELOW TWENTY FIVE YOU DON'T GET THE FULL 
MINIMUM WAGE THE UNIONS HAVE BEEN 
CAMPAIGNING THAT THEY SHOULD GET 
THE FULL AMOUNT SO THERE WOIL BE 
AN ISSUE 
IT'S AN ACCOUNTS AND 
BUREAUCRATS' DREAM IT IS WONDERFUL 
GO AND THINK ABOUT IT AND COME BACK 
AND TELL US MORE IN TEN MINUTES I I THOUGHT I WAS DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO 
MAKING A POLITICAL JUDGMENT SO I 
MERELY ALLOWED YOU TO SAY IT WAS 
IT'S WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAY THEY 
WILL DO WE WILL NO DOUBT REPORT 
LATER 
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON TO LATER REACT TO THAT NEWS 
THIS THIS ROW HAS BEEN PART OF THE 
INCREASING PROBLEMS THAT THE PRIME 
MINISTER FACES REMEMBER A YEAR AGO 
GORDON BROWN WAS JUST WEEKS AWAY 
FROM INHERITING THE JOB HE COVETED 
FOR SO MANY YEARS TWELVE MONTHS ON 
THINGS HAVE GONE VERY WRONG IN SO 
MANY AREAS THE ECONOMY HE PROUDLY 
PRESIDED OVER IS IN TROUBLE HIS 
PARTY QUESTIONING HIS DECISIONS 
OPINION POLLS SHOWING THAT HE HAS 
EXPERIENCED THE MOST DRAMATIC DROP 
IN POPULARITY OF ANY MODERN PRIME 
MINISTER JEAN EVEN JOHN MAJOR HE 
MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY HE BOTHERED 
JENNY HAS THE DETAILS AS TO WHY HE 
IS BOTTOM OF THE CHARTS 
THIS TIME LAST YEAR AFTER A LONG 
PERIOD AT THE TOP OF THE CHARTS 
LABOUR'S'S FRONT MAN WAS ABOUT TO 
EXIT THE STAGE TO A NUMBER OF BOOS 
GORDON BROWN PROMISE TODAY ROCK OUT 
TO A MORE PRUDENT TRADITIONAL 
LABOUR SOUND AND FOR THE FIRST FEW 
MONTHS HE WAS POPULAR THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY AND WITHIN THE PARTY 
BUT HIS INDECISION AS TO WHETHER TO 
ENTER ELECTION IDOL WELL THAT COST 
HIM HIM THEN DAVID CAMERON'S NOTTING HILL 
GROVE TEND TODAY GAIN POPULARITY 
GORDON HIT BUM NOTES OVER THE LOSS 
OF THE DISKS THE PUBLIC ARE 
BECOMING LESS KEEN TO BUY TICKETS 
TO THE LABOUR GIG 
EVEN WORSE THERE ARE RUMOURS OF 
FALLINGS OUT WITHIN THE CORE OF THE 
BAND SOME HAVE COMPLAINED THAT THE 
PRIME MINISTER PRIME MINISTER 
MUMBLES HIS WORDS AND HIS VISION IS 
OBSCURED AND GORDON'S GROUPIES ON 
THE BACKBENCHERS HAVE STARTED 
CALLING FOR A NEW SOUND ARGUING 
FOR THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN PENCE 
TAX RATE DAVID MILIBAND SEEMED TO 
HAVE AN INKLING THAT GORDON'S SOWN 
WOULDN'T BE POPULAR 
WHEN I COME BACK ON THIS THIS 
PROGRAMME PEOPLE WILL BE SAYING 
WOULDN'T IT BE GOOD TO HAVE BLAIR 
BACK BECAUSE WE CAN'T STAND THAT 
GORDON BROWN 
WE SENT GILES OUT TO 
ASK COMMUTERS WHAT THEY THOUGHT 
ABOUT THAT IDEA 
DOES TEN MONTHS OF BROWN 
MAKE YOU WANT BLAIR BACK YES YES YEAH DEFINITE PLI 
DEFINITELY DEFINITELY WHY 
HE IS MORE CHARISMATIC AND WHY INTERESTING AND SEEMS TO GET ON 
BETTER WITH PEOPLE 
I THINK BLAIR WAS MORE APPROACHABLE 
HE TALKED MORE COMMON SENSE 
HE WAS EASIER TO UNDERSTAND FOR THE 
NORMAL PERSON 
I DON'T THINK I 
WOULD TRUST HIM AS A MAN TO RUN THE 
COUNTRY REALLY HE HASN'T GOT MUCH 
CREDIBILITY IT IS PERSONALITY 
RATHER THAN POLITICS I THINK 
DO YOU THINK BROWN IS BETTER 
NO NO NO I PREFER A PRIME MINISTER THAT 
IS ACTUALLY BORING L. DON'T WANT 
THE ROCK STAR PRIME MINISTER TO BE 
HONEST SO HE CAN BE AS BORING AS HE 
WANTS SO I PREFER HIM 
GORDON BROWN KNOWS HIS POLICY AND 
STUFF BETTER BUT IN LEADERSHIP I 
WOULD GUESS BLAIR IS MUCH MORE WOULD GUESS 
JOINING US IS THE DEPUTY LEADER OF 
THE LABOUR PARTY ROY HATTERSLEY 
ROY HATTERSLEY 
THAT WAS FUN IT IS NOT ABOUT REAL 
POLITICS REAL POLITICS IS THE ITEM 
YOU HAD ON EARLIER WHICH YEARS THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE SOMETHING 
IN THE EYES OF THE LOW PAID 
OTHERWISE ALISTAIR DARLING WOULDN'T 
OF DONE THE U. TURN BUT IT ADDS UP 
TO A MESS NO ONE ONE SEEMS TO KNOW 
WHAT GORDON BROWN IS DOING WHAT 
HIS VISION IS 
I KNOW 
WHAT IS IT 
ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR 
FOR A FAIR AND EQUAL SOCIETY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THE THING WE HAVE TO DO TO WIN THE 
ELECTION AND WE CAN WIN THE 
ELECTION WE WILL IF WE DO IT 
PROPERLY IS FOR GORDON TO RELAX 
AND BE HIMSELF AND SAY WHAT HE 
BELIEVES BELIEVES YOU DON'T THINK HE IS DOING THAT 
NOW 
NO HE IS NOT DOING THAT NOW NOW BUT I HOPE HE WILL DO IT AND IF HE 
DOES HE WILL WIN WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT THE CHANCELLOR WHO DID MORE 
TO HELP HELP THE POOR THAN ANY 
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER SINCE 
LLOYD GEORGE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
THE MORE EFFICIENT CHANCELLOR OF 
THE EXCHEQUER HE HAS TO BE THAT 
MAN AGAIN AS LONG AS THAT REAL 
GORDON BROWN COMES THROUGH THE 
LABOUR PARTY IS IN A STRONG 
POSITION POSITION HE HAD TIME FOR THAT REAL GORDON 
BROWN TO COME THROUGH L. STARTED 
OFF BY TALKING ABOUT HIS MORAL 
COMPASS AND PROMISING THAT WE WOULD 
SEE THE REAL GORDON BROWN AND YOU 
SAY WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM 
THAT'S WHY WE ARE TEN PER CENT AHEAD IN THE 
OPINION POLLS 
WHY DOESN'T HE DO 
THAT NOW 
THE PRESSURE IS ON HIM TO 
BE A DIFFERENT MAN FROM WHAT HE IS 
POLITICIANS ARE PUT UNDER PRESSURE 
TO DO THE THINGS WHICH THE FOCUS 
GROUPS AND THE OPINION POLLS 
SUGGEST GORDON TO TAKE A 
FOOTBALLING ANALOGY HAS TO RELAX 
AND PLAY HIS NORMAL GAME 
WHY DOES HE NEED 
CAN I ANSWER 
THE QUESTION 
WHY CAN'T HE BE 
HIMSELF 
LET ME ANSWER THE SAME HIMSELF QUESTION YOU KEEP ASKING ME THE 
PRESSURE ON HIM IS ALWAYS THE 
PRESSURE PRESSURE THAT PRIME 
MINISTERS HAVE TO FACE WHICH IS TO 
DO SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT NATURAL 
BECAUSE THEIR ADVISORS AND THE 
OPINION POLLS SUGGEST IT GORDON 
HAS TO BE MORE NATURAL AND HAS TO 
RELY ON THE FACT THAT THE OPINION 
POLLS ARE VOLATILE WE HAVE SEEN 
THE LABOUR IMPROVE SIX PER CENT WE CAN LOSE 
TEN PER CENT IN TWO MONTHS AND WE CAN PICK 
UP SIX PER CENT IN A WEEK WE CAN PICK UP THE 
NECESSARY PERCENTAGE TO MAKE US WIN 
THE NEXT ELECTION ALL GORDON HAS 
TO DO IS TO BE HIS NATURAL SELF AND 
TALK ABOUT THE THINGS HE BELIEVES 
IN THE SINCERITY THE HELP FOR THE 
POOREST THE MORE EQUAL SOCIETY AND 
AWAY WITH ALL THE THINGS THAT 
SURROUNDED POLITICS FOR FOR SO 
FORWARD AND THE STRAIGHTFORWARD 
DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THIS COUNTRY 
NEEDS IT IS PREPOSTEROUS THAT WHEN 
INCOMPETENT AND GREEDY BANKERS IN 
NEWCASTLE MAKE A TOTAL MESS OF 
THEIR BANK AND IT REFLECTS ON THE 
REST OF THE ECONOMY SOMEHOW THE 
GOVERNMENT IS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR T. GORDON BROWN OUGHT TO BE 
ATTACKING THOSE PEOPLE AS EXAMPLES 
WHAT IS WRONG WITH SOCIETY THINK 
WHAT MR. THATCHER HAD DONE MRS. 
THATCHER HAD IDENTIFIED THIS 
PROBLEM PROBLEM IT SOUNDS THAT YOU ARE SAYING THAT 
HE IS HE IS BADLY ADVISED OR WEAK 
I AM SAYING NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS 
YOU KEEP SAYING THOSE THINGS I 
KNOW THAT'S A POINT YOU WANT ME TO 
MAKE MAKE YOU 
SAID HE SHOULD BE HIMSELF I I SAID ALL PRIME MINISTERS ARE UNDER 
PRESSURE TO BEHAVE IN A CERTAIN WAY 
AND THE BEST PRIME MINISTERS WHICH 
IS WHAT GORDON CAN BECOME IS THOSE 
WHO SAY I AM MYSELF L. AM NOT 
INTERESTED IN WHAT I WAS TOLD MRS. 
THATCHER WAS TOLD TO MODERATE HER 
VIEWS MRS. THATCHER DID THE SAME 
THING WHEN SHE SAID I AM MRS. 
THATCHER I AM NOBODY ELSE IT WAS 
FINE WHEN GORDON BROWN SAYING I 
AM GORDON BROWN AND NOBODY ELSE 
GORDON BROWN WILL SURGE AHEAD 
YOU CAN ASK ME THE SAME QUESTION 
AGAIN AGAIN I THINK WE HAVE GOT YOUR ANSWER ON 
THAT THAT PATRICIA HEWITT IT TOOK TONY BLAIR 
TEN YEARS TO BECOME UNPOPULAR WHY 
HAS IT TAKEN GORDON BROWN TEN 
MONTHS 
WE ARE GOING THROUGH A MONTHS DIFFICULT TIME GORDON BROWN HAS 
BEEN ONE OF THE KEY MEMBERS OF THE 
GOVERNMENT BEFORE HE BECAME PRIME 
MINISTER YES IT IS DIFFICULT YES 
THERE HAVE BEEN MISTAKES WE TALKED 
ABOUT THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
YOU THINK THAT WAS A MISTAKE THE THE PACKAGE HAD A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN 
IT IT WAS IT A MISTAKE 
BUT DOING THE TEN 
PENCE WITHOUT LOOKING AT WHAT YOU 
DID FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING 
TO LOSE WAS A MISTAKE THAT'S BEEN 
PUT RIGHT ROY IS RIGHT WHEN MY 
ELDERLY PEOPLE GET THE INCREASED 
FUEL PAYMENT OR WHATEVER IT IS 
GOING TO BE LATER ON THIS YEAR 
THAT'S WHAT THEY WILL BE CONCERNED 
ABOUT ABOUT WE WILL SEE ABOUT THAT 
MANY PEOPLE WILL WONDER WHY DID YOU 
TAKE THE MONEY AWAY AND THEN FIND A 
WAY OF HAVING TO GIVE IT BACK TO ME 
BUT WE WILL SEE AS THAT WILL COME 
THROUGH DO YOU THINK GORDON BROWN 
IS BEING HIMSELF 
IN THE LAST 
COUPLE OF WEEKS I HAVE HEARD GORDON 
ON TWO OCCASIONS MONDAY ON THE 
MEETING OF THE LABOUR M. P.'S AND HE 
WAS TERRIFIC HE SAID WHAT HE 
BELIEVED WHICH IS HE UNDERSTANDS 
ALL THE PRESSURES ON PEOPLE 
INCREASED FUEL PRICES DIFFICULTIES 
WITH MORTGAGES 
HE UNDERSTANDS THAT HE WENT TO 
SAY THAT TO THE LABOUR BACKBENCHERS 
BECAUSE THEY WERE SAYING YOU DON'T 
UNDERSTAND THAT 
THEY WERE SAYING THAT AND ISN'T IT 
BETTER TO HAVE PRIME MINISTER WHO 
SAYS YES I DO GET IT YES WE ARE 
GOING TO LOOK AT THIS AND FIND 
SOLUTION BUT WHAT WE ARE NOT GOING 
TO DO IS REWRITE THE ENTIRE BUDGET 
OR CANCEL LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WE 
CAN'T DO THAT AND GO BACK ON THE 
TEN PENCE RATE OR THE TWENTY PENCE TAX 
CUT CUT THE TWO PENCE TAX CUT 
TO TWENTY PENCE 
WHICH INVOLVED FURTHER 
INCREASES FURTHER UP 
OVERALL IT WASN'T A TAX CUT 
OVERALL IT WAS TAX NEUTRAL 
YOU USED TO BE IN THE LABOUR PARTY 
AND YOU KNEW GORDON BROWN WELL AT 
ONE STAGE WHAT DO 
REGAN BE REGAN AND LET GORDON BE 
GORDON GORDON IF HE HAD BEEN HE WOULDN'T BE IN 
THE PROBLEMS HE IS IN AT THE MOMENT 
THE PROBLEM WITH THE TEN PENCE TAX 
RATE ISN'T THE ARITHMETIC IT IS 
THE IDEA THERE WAS A TAX CUT FOR 
THE MAJORITY PAID FOR BY THE 
POOREST PEOPLE IN SOCIETY AND THAT 
WENT GENCE HIS AGAINST HIS OWN 
VALUES AND ABOUT THE FAT CATS IN 
THE BANKING SYSTEM THEY HAVE 
ALLOWED THE FAT CATS TO RUN RINGS 
AROUND THEM THAT'S BEEN THE STORY 
LAST SIX MONTHS FINANCIAL 
CRISIS HE HASN'T BEEN TRUE TO 
HIMSELF AND COMPOUNDED THE PROBLEM 
HE DIDN'T HE IS TAKING ON THE 
MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS OF THE BANKS 
NO NO NO 
OH YES HE IS 
HE IS HE IS SWAPPING THE MORTGAGE 
OBLIGATIONS OF THE BANKS FOR 
BRITISH TREASURY BILLS 
IT IS PARTLY OFF SET BY DISCOUNTING 
HE IS NOT INSISTING ON 
IF HOUSE 
PRICES COLLAPSE THE MORTGAGE ASSETS 
WILL NOT BE WORTH WHAT THEY ARE 
NOW 
THE WHOLE SENSE OF ECONOMIC NOW SUCCESS 
LET ME JUST REGISTER THE SUCCESS FACT THAT I DO NOT AGREE WITH THAT 
THE DISCOUNTING THAT THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND HAS INSISTED ON THE FEES 
THEY ARE CHARGING AND THE FATH FACT 
THAT THE RISK OF PEOPLE DEFAULTING 
ON MORTGAGES STAYS WITH THE BANKS 
BANKS MEANS THE RESPONSIBILITY IS 
WHERE IT IS AND CLEARLY THE 
SHAREHOLDERS AND IT SHOULD BE THE 
DIRECTORS OF THE BANKS THAT ARE 
GOING INTO PROBLEMS WILL CARRY SOME 
OF THE CAN FOR IT AND SO THEY 
SHOULD SHOULD AND THEY WILL RETIRE ON HUGE 
SALARIES LOOK AT THE MAN FROM 
NORTHERN ROCK 
ANDREW THAT'S WHY I CHANGED THE LAW 
YEARS AGO TO INSIST ON SHAREHOLDERS 
HAVING AN ANNUAL VOTE ON DIRECTORS 
PAY PAY THE DIRECTOR OF THE NORTHERN ROCK 
LEAVING FOR ONE MILLION 
CAN YOU SPELL EXCELLENCE

OVER AND MY PREDICTION WILL BE EVEN 
IF SOME LABOUR DIE HARD REBEL PUTS 
DOWN AN AMENDMENT THEY WILL NOT GET 
THE NUMBERS NOW TO DO IT WHAT 
BECOMES FASCINATING FOR PRIME 
MINISTER'S QUESTIONS WHAT DO YOU 
DO IF IF YOU ARE THE TORY LEADER I 
SUSPECT YOU CROW ABOUT A U. TURN 
I SUSPECT THAT ALTHOUGH THE 
REBELLION MAYBE OVER THE COVERAGE 
IN THE PRESS EVEN IN LABOUR 
LEADING NEWSPAPERS TOMORROW WILL 
NOT BE FRIENDLY 
NO REMEMBER THIS FOR PEOPLE 
WATCHING WHAT THEY WILL BE 
THINKING IS I LOST THIS IN THIS 
WEEK'S OR THIS MONTH'S PAY PACKET 
DO I GET IT BACK ANSWER NO THE 
SCRAPPING OF THE TEN PENCE TAX BAND 
GOES AHEAD WHAT MAY HAPPEN IN THE 
NEXT BUDGET NEXT YEAR YOU MIGHT BE 
HELPED WITH A TAX CREDIT OF A 
HIGHER LEVEL OF MINIMUM WAGE OR 
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT COMPENSATE YOU 
THANK YOU 
LET'S GO OVER TO THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS AND OUR MAN THERE 
THE PRIME MINISTER IS SENDING HIS 
CONDOLENCES FOR DEATHS OF 
SERVICEMEN KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN 
AND IRAQ 
WE OWE THEM AND ALL 
OTHERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES A 
DEEP DEBT OF GRATITUDE MR. SPEAKER 
I'M SURE I SPEAK FOR THE WHOLE 
HOUSE WHEN I SAY HOW SAD WE WERE TO 
LEARN OF THE DEATH OF BEGIN EDGE 
DUNWOODY SHE WAS THE LONGEST 
SERVING FEMALE MEMBER OF THIS HOUSE 
OUR THOUGHTS AND OUR PRAYERS ARE 
WITH HER FAMILY GWENTH THIS 
MORNING HI MEETINGS IN ADDITION TO 
MY DUTIES IN THE HOUSE I SHALL HAVE 
FURTHER SUCH MEETINGS EARLIER 
LATER IN THE DAY 
WHILE I WELCOME 
THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED LETTER FROM 
THE CHANCELLOR I ASK THE PRIME 
MINISTER IF HE WILL GIVE A SPECIFIC 
COMMITMENT TO BRING FORWARD IN THIS 
FINANCIAL YEAR SPECIFICALLY 
MEASURES TO PROTECT THE FIVE 
MILLION PEOPLE WHO WILL BE 
PENALISED FROM THE ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN PENCE TAX BAND WOULD HE AGREE 
THAT SUCH A STEP WOULD BE 
CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S 
SUCCESSFUL POLICIES IN COMBATING 
POVERTY MAKING WORK PAY AND 
BRINGING PEOPLE FROM WELFARE WORK 
MR. SPEAKER FOR OVER A DECADE WORK WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE AND CHILD AND 
PENSION CREDITS THIS GOVERNMENT 
HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY GOVERNMENT 
IN A CENTURY TO TACKLE CHILD 
POVERTY AND HELP LOW INCOME 
FAMILIES BUT AS WE HAVE FOUND 
THERE ARE BETTER WAYS OF HELPING 
LOW INCOME FAMILIES THAN THE TEN 
PENCE RATE L. THINK I SHOULD TELL 
THE HOUSE THAT EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE BENEFITS 
OF THE RATE GO TO HIGHER RATE AND 
BASSIC RATE TAXPAYERS THAT THERE ARE TEMPORARY LOSS OF SUEB TITLES 
SUEB TITLES SUBTITLES 
WE WILL BRING FORWARD PROPOSALS 
PERHAPS USING THE MECHANISM OF THE 
WINTER ALLOWANCE SO THEY HAVE 
FURTHER MONEY AND PAID BACK TO 
APRIL THIS YEAR THAT IS WHY ALSO 
ON THE WORKING TAX CREDIT WHETHER 
THERE ARE ISSUES ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE 
AND ISSUES ABOUT PART TIME WORKERS 
WE WILL ALSO BRING FORWARD 
PROPOSALS SOON IN TIME FOR THE 
PRE BUDGET REPORT MR. SPEAKER WE 
ARE DETERMINED TO TAKE ACTION 
BECAUSE WE ARE THE PARTY OF 
FAIRNESS TACKLING POVERTY L. L. WOULD 
BE I WOULD PREFER TO BE ON THIS 
SIDE CUTTING POVERTY THAN THAT 
GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY WERE IN POWER 
TREBLING POVERTY 
I THINK WE CAN 
CALL THIS SESSION PRIME MINISTER'S 
U. TURNS RATHER THAN QUESTIONS CAN 
I JOIN THE PRIME MINISTER IN PAYING 
TRIBUTE TO 
WHO WERE 
KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN ON SUNDAY 
THIRTEENTH APRIL AND TO TROOPER ROBERT 
PIERCE SON WHO WAS KILLED THIS 
MONDAY THE WHOLE OF THIS COUNTRY 
OWES THEM A GREAT DEBT OF GRATITUDE 
I ALSO ASSOCIATE MY PARTY WITH THE 
PRIME MINISTER'S WARM WORDS ABOUT 
MISS DUNWOODY SHE WAS THE VERY 
MODEL OF AN INDEPENDENT BACKBENCHER 
SHE HAD NO TRUCK WITH POLITICAL 
CORRECTNESS AND CORE RAGEOUS IN HER 
BELIEFS AND SHE COURAGOUS AND I 
CAN REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE SHE SAT 
BUT SHE WAS NEVER AFRAID TO HOLD 
ANY GOVERNMENT TO ACCOUNT IF SHE 
THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING THE WRONG 
THING AND WILL BE SORELY MISSED 
THE PRIME MINISTER'S EMERGENCY 
ANOUNCTIONMENT ABOUT INCOME TAX 
THIS MORNING REPRESENTS A MASSIVE 
LOSS OF AUTHORITY THIS MORNING 
ANNOUNCEMENT THIS MORNING WE HAVE 
HAD PANIC CONCESSIONS BEFORE COMING 
TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WE WERE 
TOLD THERE WOULD BE NO BACKDOWN AND 
WE HAD A BACKDOWN WE WERE TOLD HE 
COULDN'T REWRITE THE BUDGET HE'S 
REWRITING IT THERE ARE NOW MASSIVE 
CONCESSIONS WILL HE TELL US IS HE 
MAKING THESE CHANGES BECAUSE HE 
THOUGHT HE WOULD LOSE THE VOTE NEXT 
WEEK 
WE HAVE SAID FOR SOME TIME WEEK THAT WE WANT TO DO MORE TO HELP 
PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES AND IF I 
ALSO SAY TO HIM THIS HIS PARTY 
POLICY TWO YEARS AGO WAS TO ABOLISH 
THE RATE LAST YEAR IT WAS TO 
ABSTAIN ON THE RATE THIS YEAR IT 
IS TO KEEP THE RATE THEY KNOW 
DON'T KNOW YES PARTY THEY CANNOT 
MAKE UP THEIR MIND WHAT THEY ARE 
GOING TO DO WE WILL BE CONSISTENT 
IN OUR DESIRE TO TACKLE WILD 
POVERTY 
CONSISTENT DOES THE PRIME POVERTY MINISTER HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT A 
PATHETIC FIGURE HE CUTS TODAY HE 
IS MAKING THESE CHANGES BECAUSE HE 
THOUGHT HE WOULD LOSE THE VOTE OR 
IS THIS LIKE THE GENERAL ELECTION 
THAT HE CANCELLED EVEN THOUGH HE 
THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO WIN IT 
ISN'T HE JUST TAKING PEOPLE FOR 
FOOLS ONCE AGAIN WHY WON'T HE 
ADMIT IT HE'S NOT MAKING THE 
CHANGES BECAUSE HE THINKS THEY ARE 
RIGHT OR MAKING THEM BECAUSE HE 
WANTS TO HELP THE PEOPLE THAT HE 
HURT HE'S MAKING THEM BECAUSE HE 
WAS FRIGHTENED OF LOSING A VOTE 
WHY NOT ADMIT IT AND BE STRAIGHT 
WITH PEOPLE 
I SEE HIS NEW FOUND 
ENTHUSIASM FOR POVERTY HAS LASTED 
ONLY A FEW SECONDS WHY DOES HE NOT 
ADDRESS THE CENTRAL ISSUE AND THE 
CENTRAL ISSUE IS WE ARE TAKING MORE 
PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY THAN ANY 
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT IF WE TOOK THE 
ADVICE OF THE OPPOSITION PARTY WE 
WOULD NOT HAVE THE MINIMUM WAGE 
YET TWO MILLION PEOPLE ARE BETTER 
OFF IF WE TOOK HIS ADVICE WE WOULD 
NOT HAVE TAX CREDIT YET SIX 
MILLION ARE BETTER OFF THERE WOULD 
BE TEN L. E. BILLION OF TAX CUTS 
DEPRIVING THE POOR OF THE PUBLIC 
SERVICES THEY NEED THE CHOICE IS 
CLEAR BETWEEN A CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
THAT WOULD CUT THE INCOMES OF THE 
POOR AND A LABOUR PARTY THAT WILL 
INCREASE THEM 
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT 
IS WEAKNESS DITHERING AND 
INDECISION FROM THE PRIME MINISTER 
HE TALKS ABOUT THE CENTRAL ISSUE 
LET US DEAL WITH THAT WHY DID ALL 
THIS BEGIN THIS BEGAN BECAUSE AS 
CHANCELLOR HE STOOD THERE AND 
PRESENTED A TAX BUDGET TO TRY TO 
WRONG FOOT THE OPPOSITION AND TRY 
TO POSE AS A TAX CUTTER TO TRY TO 
WIN A FEW CHEAP HEADLINES IN THE 
NEWSPAPERS AND HE DID ALL OF THIS 
HE DID ALL OF IT ON THE BACK OF 
FIVE POINT THREE MILLION OF THE POOREST PEOPLE 
IN OUR COUNTRY WILL HE ADMIT NOW 
THAT BUDGET WAS A GROSS 
MISCALCULATION THAT WAS IMMORAL 
AND APOLOGISE FOR THE BUDGET 
BECAUSE EVERYBODY NOW AGREES THAT 
THE TEN PENCE RATE IS NOT THE BEST 
WAY OF TACKLING POVERTY AND THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY AGREED WITH THAT 
TWO YEARS AGO THEY ABSTAINED 
YEAR AGO AND NOW ARE SUPPORTING THE 
RATE AND NOBODY BELIEVES THEY ARE 
CREDIBILITY IN THAT MATTER LET ME 
JUST QUOTE WHAT THE LEADER OF THE 
OPPOSITION SAID THAT HE WANTED TO 
SIM FLY ALL THE TAX RATES AND 
PRODUCE ONE BAND SOMEWHERE AROUND 
TWENTY PENCE THAT APPLIED TO SPENDING 
SAVING CAPITAL GAINS AND INCOME 
THE POLICY HE ANNOUNCED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO WAS 
NOT JUST CUTTING RATE BUT 
ABOLISHING TAX CREDITS AND 
ALLOWANCES THAT IS NOT PARTY 
THAT CARES ABOUT THE POOR BUT 
PARTY THAT PUTS MORE PEOPLE IN 
POVERTY 
AS EVER HE WAS ABOUT TO POVERTY THUMP FIFTY THREE MILLION OF THE POOREST 
PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY AND HE IS 
GOING AROUND WITH POLICY DOCUMENTS 
TRYING TO FIND SOME EXCUSES AS 
EVER NO APOLOGY NO ADMISSION OF 
GUILT BUT A U. TURN TO SAVE HIS 
SKIN DOESN'T THIS CLIMBDOWN TELL 
US ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS 
GOVERNMENT IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT 
POLITICS NOT ABOUT POLICY IT'S 
ALWAYS ABOUT CALCULATIONS NOT 
ABOUT CONVICTION IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT 
HIS SELF INTEREST NOT THE NATIONAL 
INTEREST DOES THIS PRIME MINISTER 
THINK HIS REPUTATION CAN EVER 
RECOVER RECOVER 
WHY DOES HE NOT 
ADDRESS THE CENTRAL ISSUE HOW WE 
LIFT PEOPLE OUT OF LOW INCOMES AND 
POVERTY IN THIS COUNTRY WHY NOT 
ADMIT THAT AS A RESULT OF OUR TAX 
CREDITS WHICH WE APPOSED THREE 
MILLION PEOPLE ARE IN FAMILIES WITH 
INCOMES OF MORE THAN EIGHTY A WEEK 
FURTHER TO ONE NINETY NINE P. AND THERE ARE TWO 
MILLION PENSIONERS WITH INCOMES FORTY 
MORE THAN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN NONE OF THAT COULD 
HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED BY THE TEN PENCE 
RATE BUT ONLY TAX CREDITS WHY 
DIDN'T HE RECOGNISE THAT UNDER THE 
GOVERNMENT ONE MILLION PENSIONERS 
HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF POVERTY 
NEARLY ONE MILLION CHILDREN TAKEN 
OUT OF POVERTY THREE MILLION MORE 
JOBS CREATED WE ARE NEARER TO FULL 
EMPLOYMENT THAN AT ANY TIME IN OUR 
HISTORY AND NONE OF THEM COULD HAVE 
HAPPENED IF WE HAD FOLLOWED THE 
POLICIES OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
THE TRUTH IS THAT UNDER THIS 
GOVERNMENT YES I WILL TELL YOU 
WHAT IS MORE UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT 
THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE PEOPLE IN 
EXTREME POVERTY THAN WHEN THEY CAME 
TO POWER THE PRIME MINISTER TALKS 
ABOUT THE CENTRAL ISSUE THE 
CENTRAL ISSUE HERE IS HIS MASSIVE 
LOSS OF AUTHORITY WAS THERE EVER 
ANYTHING MORE HUMILIATING THAN 
PRIME MINISTER BREAKING OFF HIS 
TALKS WITH THE PRESIDENT ASKING 
FOR AN OUTSIDE LINE IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE TO BEG WITH ONE OF HIS PPSS 
NOT TO RESIGN THIS IS WHAT LABOUR 
M. P.'S THIS IS WHAT LABOUR M. P.'S THEY 
SHOULD BE QUIET AND LISTEN THIS IS 
WHAT LABOUR M. P.'S ARE SAYING THE THE LET THE LEADER OF THE 
OPPOSITION SPEAK ORDER THE 
HONOURABLE LADY IS TOO NOISY FAR 
TOO NOISY IT SHOWS THE LORD HIGH 
CHANCELLOR THAT IS HIS TITLE NOW 
HE'S TOO NOISY AS WELL 
IT'S NOT 
OFTEN YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE LORD 
CHANCELLOR AN ASBO THIS IS WHAT 
LABOUR M. P.'S ARE SAYING ABOUT THEIR 
PRIME MINISTER HE'S LOSING TOUCH 
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT FAIRNESS IS 
HE NEEDS TO SEE THE WORD THROUGH 
THE EYES OF VOTERS HE'S LIKE A 
SCARED RABBIT IN THE HEADLIGHTS 
THE LABOUR PEER LONDON DESAI SAYS 
HIS LEADERSHIP STYLE IS LIKE 
PORRIDGE ANOTHER WEEK LIKE THIS 
AND IT WILL BE CHEERIOS ISN'T IT 
THE CASE MR. SPEAKER THAT THE 
LABOUR PARTY HAVE FINALLY WORKED 
OUT THAT THEY HAVE GOT A LOSER NOT 
A LEADER 
WHY DOES HE NEVER ADDRESS 
THE CENTRAL ISSUES 
ORDER ALLOW THE PRIME MINISTER TO 
BE HEARD 
CHILD BENEFIT INCREASED 
FROM ELEVEN TO TWENTY UNDER THIS 
GOVERNMENT THE POOREST CHILD IN 
THE COUNTRY TWENTY SEVEN UNDER THE 
CONSERVATIVES SEVENTY FIVE UNDER LABOUR 
TACKLING POVERTY SO THAT NEARLY 
ONE MILLION CHILDREN ARE OUT OF 
POVERTY ONE MILLION PENSIONERS OUT 
OF POVERTY THESE ARE THE THINGS WE 
ARE DOG HERE IS THE CHOICE A 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT THAT SUPPORTS A 
MINIMUM WAGE SUPPORTS TACKLING 
CHILD POVERTY PENSIONER POVERTY 
AND HAS GOT THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN 
JOBS AND A CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT 
WOULD GO FOR TEN MILLION OF TAX 
CUTS THE PRIORITY GOING TO STAMP 
DUTY ON SHARES AND NOT TO THE 
POOREST IN THE COUNTRY L. KNOW WHAT 
SIDE THE COUNTRY IS ON 
THE CENTRAL 
ISSUE IS THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
WEAKNESS AND HIS INABILITY TO HOLD 
TO A POSITION FOR LONGER THAN THIS THE ONLY TIME WHEN THIS 
PRIME MINISTER LISTENS TO PEOPLE IS 
WHEN HE'S FACED WITH PERSONAL 
DEFEAT ISN'T THAT THE LESSON THAT 
EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY IN 
LONDON AND BEYOND SHOULD THINK 
ABOUT ON FIRST MAY THAT IF THEY 
WAPBLT TO WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE 
TO THIS WEAK AND INCOMPETENT 
MESSAGE THAT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH MR. MR SPEAKER THEY USED TO OPPOSE THE TEN 
PENCE RATE THEN LAST YEAR THEY 
ABSTAINED ON THE RATE THEN NOW 
THEY THIS YEAR AS A RESULT OF 
OPPURTUNISM THEY WANT TODAY KEEP 
THE RATE WE ARE FOR OPPORTUNITY 
FOR EVERYONE THEY ARE FOR 
OPPORTUNITY TSH OPPURTUNISM IN 
EVERYTHING 
OAPS ARE ABLE TO TRAVEL EVERYTHING WITH THEIR PASSES THIS HAS BEEN 
WARMLY WELCOMED IN MY CONSTITUENCY 
AND EVEN REPLICATED AROUND THE U. K. 
DOES MY FRIEND AGREE THAT THE 
PROPOSAL BY THE OPPOSITION TO 
ABOLISH THE FREEDOM PASS IS MORE 
DIMWITED THAN DICK WHITTINGTON MR. MR SPEAKER I AM PROUD OF OUR RECORD 
ON FREE TRAVEL FOR PENSIONERS AND 
I AM PROUD THAT IN LONDON THE MAYOR 
HAS BEEN ABLE TO EXTEND FREE TRAVEL 
TO LARGE NUMBERS OF FURTHER PEOPLE 
BUT I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO REMEMBER 
THAT THE CANDIDATE FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVE MAYOR IN LONDON SAYS 
WE HAVE GOT TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR 
WHERE THE SCOPE FOR REAL ECONOMIES 
IS THE REAL BIG TICKET IS THE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE AND TRANSPORT 
FOR LONDON THAT'S WHERE THE REAL 
SAVINGS BELIEVE ME ARE TO BE FOUND 
THE CHOICE IS CLEAR INVESTMENT IN 
THRAPBS PORT TRANSPORT UNDER 
LABOUR CUTS IN TRANSPORT UNDER THE 
CONSERVATIVES I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS 
MY SYMPATHY 
AND CON LOW LANCE 
ORDER 
HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN TO BE HARD 
OFFER 
MY CONDOLENCE TO GRAHAM 
LIVINGSTONE AND AND TROOPER PEARSON 
DUNWOODY WHO 
ENJOYED ADMIRATION ON ALL SIDES OF 
THE HOUSE 
I THOUGHT PENALISING THE POOR TO 
REWARD THE RICH WAS THE JOB OF THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
SO AS THE PRIME MINISTER 
DELIBERATELY MAKES THE LOWEST 
EARNERS EVEN WORSE OFF IN THIS 
COUNTRY CAN I EXPLAIN DOING 
THE TORIES JOB FOR 
MR. SPEAKER WE 
HAVE DONE MORE TO 
TAKE CHILDREN OUT OF 
TAKE CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY THAN ANY 
GOVERNMENT IN 
THE HISTORY 
OF 
THIS COUNTRY SINCE THE SECOND WORLD 
WAR AND WE HAVE DONE MORE TO TAKE 
MORE PENSIONERS OUT OF POVERTY THAN 
ANY GOVERNMENT AND CONTRARY TO THE 
ADVICE OF THE LIBERAL PARTY WHO 
WANTED US TO ABOLISH THE NEW DEAL 
WE HAVE HELPED MORE YOUNG PEOPLE 
AND UNEMPLOYED INTO WORK THAN ANY 
OTHER GOVERNMENT SINCE NINETEEN FORTY FIVE IF WE 
HAD TAKEN THE ADVICE OF THE LIBERAL 
PARTY THERE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT WHERE THERE IS 
LOW UNEMPLOYMENT 
LABOUR LABOUR MEMBERS ARE IN FULL 
CRY BUT WHERE WERE THEY ON BUDGET 
DAY DAY THE TRUTH IS THE TRUTH IS THAT 
UNDER HIS GOVERNMENT INCOME 
INEQUALITY IS RISING WORKING AGE 
POVERTY IS UP AND NOW HE IS 
DOUBLING THE TAX RATE FOR THE 
LOWEST EARNERS MR. SPEAKER THE 
PRIME MINISTER USED TO BE A MAN OF 
PRINCIPLE PRINCIPLE BUT IF HE CAN'T DELIVER ON POVERTY 
WHAT ON ON EARTH IS THE POINT OF 
THIS INCREASINGLY POINTLESS PRIME 
MINISTER MINISTER THE POINT IS TO HAVE ECONOMIC 
GROWTH IN THIS COUNTRY THAT GETS 
MORE PEOPLE INTO WORK 
AND THAT COULD NOT HAPPEN UNDER 
LIBERAL POLICIES THE POINT OF THIS 
GOVERNMENT TO IS TO TAKE MORE 
PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY AND THAT'S 
WHAT WE ARE DOING THE POINT POINT 
IS TO TAKE MORE PENSIONERS OUT OF 
POVERTY AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE 
DOING I REPEAT IF HE FOLLOWED THE 
POLICIES OF THE LIBERAL PARTY 
THERE THERE WOULD BE LESS PEOPLE IN 
WORK AND MORE PEOPLE IN POVERTY 
MR. SPEAKER LAST WEEK THE PRIME 
MINISTER MADE A VERY SUCCESSFUL 
VISIT TO ILFORD TO MY CONSTITUENCY 
DOES DOES THE PRIME MINISTER AGREE 
THAT LONDON IS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL 
DIVERSE CITY IN THE WORLD WITH 
FANTASTIC COMMUNITY RELATIONS WITH 
INVESTMENT IN BUSES AND TRAINS AND 
CROSSRAIL TO COME AND DOES HE THINK 
THAT ALL THAT WOULD BE PUT AT RISK 
IF SOMEONE IF SOMEONE WITH 
UNCOSTED COMMITMENTS AND SHADOWY 
ADVISORS WAS TO BE PARACHUTED INTO 
OUR CAPITAL CITY 
MR. SPEAKER PEOPLE KNOW THAT MORE 
PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO USE PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT MORE PEOPLE USING OUR 
BUSES MORE PEOPLE USING OUR LONDON 
UNDERGROUND AS RESULT OF THE 
POLICIES OF THE MAYOR OF LONDON 
AND MORE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO MORE 
PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING ALSO AS A RESULT OF THE 
POLICIES OF THE MAYOR OF LONDON 
WHAT WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE TO THE 
PEOPLE OF LONDON IS TO WAKE UP AND 
FIND THAT AS A RESULT OF A 
CONSERVATIVE MAYOR HOUSING WAS 
BEING CUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAKEN 
AWAY AND THE TRANSPORT SFRTION 
BEING CUT THAT WE WILL NOT ALLOW 
TO HAPPEN 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER TOMORROW 
TEACHERS ARE GOING TO BE AWAY FROM 
WORK ON STRIKE TODAY SHOULD THEY 
BE AWAY FROM WORK ON A BANK 
HOLIDAY HOLIDAY MR. SPEAKER MR. SPEAKER LET ME DEAL 
WITH THE FIRST QUESTION THE FIRST 
PART OF THE QUESTION FIRST THINK 
IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT THE TEACHERS 
ARE GOING ON STRIKE TOMORROW AND 
THE REASON IS EVEN THE CHAIRMAN OF 
THE PAY REVIEW BODY SAID THIS IS AN 
INDEPENDENT AWARD AND ONE THAT THE 
TEACHERS SHOULD BE PREPARED TO 
ACCEPT AND I HOPE THAT AFTER 
REFLECTION THE TEACHERS WILL 
RECONSIDER THE ACTION THAT THEY ARE 
GOING TO TAKE AND THE FUTURE ON 
THIS MATTER AS FAR AS SAINT GEORGE'S 
DAY THAT'S A MATTER FOR PUBLIC 
DEBATE AS TO WHETHER THIS IS GOING 
TO BE HOLIDAY 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER MR. SPEAKER 
ONE OF THE BEST BEST FORMING 
SCHOOLS IN THIS AREA IS THE WICK 
HAM SPORTS COLLEGE SADLY IT WAS 
DAMAGED BY PRIME MINISTER CAN ASK 
THE PRIME MINISTER TO ASK THE 
EDUCATION MINISTER TO BRING FORWARD 
BSF MONEY TO REPAIR THE SCHOOL AND 
NOT LIKE THE PARTY OPPOSITE DO AWAY 
WITH BILLIONS ON THE BSF PROGRAMME 
MR. SPEAKER I KNOW THE SCHOOL WHO 
WHICH HE REFERS WAS SUBJECT TO A 
FIRE BUT THE CHILDREN ARE BACK IN 
THE SCHOOL AND I KNOW HE WISHES 
RESOURCES FOR URGENT REPAIR WORK 
THE BUILDING SCHOOLS FOR THE FUTURE 
PROGRAMME IS INCREASING THE NUMBER 
OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS ARE RENEWED OR 
REBUILT AND HE IS RIGHT WHAT WOULD 
PUT THAT AT RISK IS THE 
CONSERVATIVE PROPOSALS TO TAKE FOUR POINT FIVE 
FROM THAT PROGRAMME AND DEPRIVE 
PEOPLE PEOPLE OF THE SECONDARY 
SCHOOLS THEY HAD BEEN PROMISED 
THE FIRST STAGE OF THE RENEWABLE 
TRANSPORT FUEL SCHEME CAME INTO 
OPERATION LAST WEEK 
COULD I ASK THE PRIME MINISTER WHAT 
HIS PRIORITY IS IS IT TO PUT 
BIOETHANOL IN A RANGE ROVER'S FUEL 
TANK OR PUT BREAD IN AN AFRICAN 
STOMACH STOMACH MR. SPEAKER WE HAD A SEMINAR ON 
FOOD YESTERDAY IN DOWNING STREET 
WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT 
ORGANISATIONS THAT ARE INVOLVED 
I THINK THERE IS A GENERAL 
RECOGNITION THAT THE POLICY ON 
BIOETHANOL HAS TO BE RENEWED M. 
REVIEWED REVIEWED WE HAVE REMOVED THE TAX INSEN 
SENTIVE INCENTIVE ASSOCIATED WITH 
IT IT I THINK HE WILL BE AWARE THAT THE 
INCREASING NUMBERS OF CONSUMERS IN 
CHINA AND INDIA ARE PUSHING THE 
DEMAND FOR FOOD UP AT THE SAME TIME 
AS THE SUPPLY IS NOT RISING AND 
THAT'S WHY WE WERE KUS DISCUSSING 
EMERGENCY MEASURES THAT CAN AVOID 
FAMINE BUT INCREASE FOOD SUPPLY TO 
CUT THE PRICES OF FOOD IN THIS 
COUNTRY AS IN EVERY COUNTRY IN THE 
WORLD AND I HOPE THERE WILL BE ALL 
PARTY AGREEMENT ON THE NEED TO TAKE 
ACTION ON THIS 
MY FRIEND WILL KNOW THAT THE 
CHANCELLOR'S BUDGET BENEFITED FOUR 
OUT OF FIVE HOUSEHOLDS IN THIS 
COUNTRY COULD I SAY THAT I AM 
PLEASED THAT WE ARE GOING TO LOOK 
AT THE FIFTH HOUSEHOLD AS WELL 
COULD I SAY THAT CONSTITUENCIES 
LIKE MINE SUFFERED FROM POVERTY FOR 
GENERATIONS NOW NOT HELPED BY 
GOVERNMENTS IN THE PAST THAT THAT 
CLOSED COAL MINES AND CAUSED 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND THIS GOVERNMENT 
HAS NO LESSONS TO LEARN FROM THE 
ANTI POVERTY ANTI POVERTY WE HAVE HALVED UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE 
LAST TEN YEARS THERE ARE THREE 
MILLION MORE PEOPLE IN JOBS WE 
HAVE ELIMINATED LONG TERM YOUTH 
UNEMPLOYMENT WE COULD NOT NOT OF 
DONE THAT WITHOUT THE NEW DEAL 
OPPOSED BY THE PARTIES OPPOSITE WE 
WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE JOBS THEY 
ARE THE PARTY THAT IN GOVERNMENT 
CREATED MASS UNEMPLOYMENT 
MR. SPEAKER THE PRIME MINISTER 
CLAIMS TO BE THE PARTY THAT LOOKS 
AFTER JOBS WILL HE EXPLAIN WHY IT 
WAS THAT THE CHICKEN FACTORY IN 
SUTTON BENGER WAS CLOSED AND DYSON 
ARE MOVING ONE THOUSAND JOBS OFF SHORE 
DOES THE PRIME MINISTER TAKE ANY 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MELT DOWN IN 
MANUFACTURING IN MY CONSTITUENCY OR 
IS IT SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULT 
WHENEVER JOBS GO IN ANY PART OF THE 
COUNTRY THAT'S MATTER TO BE 
REGRETTED THE IMPORTANT THING WE 
ARE CREATING MORE NEW JOBS AND 
CREATING THEM MORE QUICKLY THAN 
OTHER COUNTRIES EMPLOYMENT IN THE 
LAST FIGURES WAS AT RECORD LEVELS 
TWENTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE IN WORK THREE 
MILLION MORE THAN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND 
EMPLOYMENT IS UP IN EVERY REGION 
AND COUNTRY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM 
OUR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CONTRASTS 
WITH RATE TWICE THAT IN GERMANY 
AND FRANCE RISING IN AMERICA AND I 
THINK HE SHOULD GIVE RECOGNITION OF 
THE FACT THAT EVEN IF DIFFICULT 
GLOBAL TIMES WE ARE CONTINUING TO 
CREATE JOBS AND CONTINUING TO BRING 
UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN 
I WELCOME THE CHANCELLOR'S LETTER 
TO ME THIS MORNING ON THE TREASURY 
INQUIRY AND THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
AND HIS COMMITMENT IN PARTICULAR TO 
HELP THE LOW PAID WITHOUT CHILDREN 
AND THE PENSIONERS UNDER SIXTY FIVE AND 
MAKE THOSE THINGS BACKDATED TO THIS 
FINANCIAL YEAR THE PRIME MINISTER 
WILL BE AWARE THAT THE TREASURY 
COMMITTEE IDENTIFIED FOUR GROUPS 
AND AT OUR INQUIRY WE WILL BE 
REPORTING BEFORE THE REPORT STAGE 
ON THE FINANCE BILL 
CAN I SEEK THE CO OPERATION OF THE 
PRIME MINISTER TO SERIOUSLY 
CONSIDER OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND 
CONTEMPLATE ANY FURTHER MEASURES 
WHICH THE TREASURY COMMITTEE WOULD 
PROPOSE IN THIS INQUIRY 
I JUST HAVE TO POINT OUT TO THE 
TREASURY COMMITTEE COMMITTEE THAT 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURES SEVENTY PER CENT OF 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE LOSING IN THE 
BUDGET ARE PEOPLE WITH INCOMES 
ABOVE TWENTY THOUSAND 
AND WHILE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO 
ARE LOW PAID AND ON LOW INCOMES 
THAT ARE BEING HELPED BY THE CHILD 
TAX CREDIT WHICH WE HAVE RAISED AND 
BY PENSIONERS TAX ALLOWANCES WHICH 
HAVE BEEN EXTENDED AND BY THE 
PENSION CREDIT WHICH IS RISING AND 
BY THE WORKING TAX CREDIT THERE IS 
MORE THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE TWO 
AREAS THAT I TALKED ABOUT HELPING 
PENSIONERS SIXTY TO SIXTY FOUR AND HELPING 
THOSE ON LOW PAY WHO ARE PART OF 
THE LOW PAID GROUP IN OUR SOCIETY 
BUT NOT PART OF THE WORKING TAX 
CREDIT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING 
TO LOOK AT OVER THE NEXT PERIOD OF 
TIME WE WILL DO SO IN CONSULTATION 
WITH THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE 
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE 
THAT OF THOSE WHO LOST IN THE 
BUDGET SEVENTY PER CENT WERE ABOVE TWENTY THOUSAND 
MR. SPEAKER WOULD MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIEND AGREE WITH ME 
THAT THE ARMY CADET FORCES WHO ARE 
NATIONAL VOLUNTARY YOUTH 
ORGANISATIONS ARE EXCELLENT AND THE 
BEST YOUTH ORGANISATIONS IN GREAT 
BRITAIN TODAY 
THEY ARE ORGANISED BY ENTHUSIASTIC 
STAFF AND BY OFFICERS MY 
DETACHMENT THE DURHAM A. C. F. TAKES 
SEVEN HUNDRED YOUNGSTERS AWAY DURING A SUMMER 
HOLIDAY MANY OF WHOM WOULD NEVER 
GO AWAY ON HOLIDAY WOULD MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIEND ANNOUNCE TO THE 
HOUSE TODAY WHAT FURTHER MY 
GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO DO TO 
SUPPORT THE FUTURE OF THE ARMY 
CADET FORCES 
I'M GRATEFUL TO MY FRIEND BECAUSE 
SHE WORKS WITH LOCAL ARM CADETS 
AND PLAYS PROMINENT ROLE IN THE 
ARMY CADETS IN HER AREA AND I HAVE 
BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE WORK OF OUR 
CADET FORCES THE SEA CADET SORP 
AND THE AIR TRAINING CORP AND THEY 
DEVELOP A SENSE OF SELF RELIANCE 
AND SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY 
AMONGST YOUNG PEOPLE AND I PRAISE 
ALL ADULTS INVOLVED IN THIS WE 
WILL PROVIDE EXTRA MONEY TO HELP 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF CADET FORCE NOT 
JUST IN SOME SCHOOLS BUT ACROSS A 
RANGE OF SCHOOLS AND OF COURSE WE 
ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING MORE 
MONEY FOR POSITIVE OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY 
THE CADET FORCES PLAY AN IMPORTANT 
ROLE WE ARE DETERMINED TO EXTEND 
THEM THEM PRIME MINISTER MY CONSTITUENTS IN 
ILFORD NORTH ARRIVE HOME LATE AT 
NIGHT LATE AT NIGHT TO FIND SOME 
UNMANNED STATIONS IS THIS NOT AND 
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT THE 
CURRENT MAYOR OF LONDON IS LETTING 
THEM DOWN AND HOPEFULLY NEXT WEEK 
WE WILL HAVE A MAYOR OF LONDON WHO 
WILL PROTECT THEIR SAFETY 
WELL IF THAT IS THE CASE THE LAST 
THING THAT THAT PARTY WOULD WANT TO 
DO IS CUT SPENDING ON TRANSPORT 
BUT THAT'S WHAT THE POLICY OF THE 
BODY IS 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER PEOPLE ON 
GOOD SALARIES TEND TO ENSURE THAT 
THAT THEY ARE PAYING THE CORRECT 
AMOUNT OF TAX AND AND TAKING 
ADVANTAGE OF ANY TAX CONCESSIONS OR 
TAX RELIEF THAT'S AVAILABLE 
PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES DO NOT 
WILL MY RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND 
ENSURE THERE IS A CONCERTED AND 
SUSTAINED EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT 
PEOPLE ARE TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF 
THE TAX CREDITS AND CONCESSIONS AND 
BENEFITS THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO 
AS MY RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND SAYS 
TAX CREDITS ARE IMPORTANT AND THEY 
ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY CAN TAKE 
PEOPLE OUT OF POFERTY WHETHER IT 
BE TAX CREDITS OR COUNCIL TAX 
BENEFIT AND HOUSING BENEFIT WE ARE 
PROMOTING AN AWARENESS CAMPAIGN 
TARGETED AT PENSIONERS SO THEY KNOW 
OF THEIR RIGHTS SO THEY CAN APPLY 
FOR THE BENEFIT 
ARE 
DETERMINED THAT THE BENEFITS GETS 
TO THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER THE WESTLAND 
GENERAL HOSPITAL IS THE PROVIDER OF 
ACUTE HEART CARE THOSE SERVICES 
ARE PROPOSED FOR CLOSURE LATER THIS 
YEAR THAT WOULD LEAD THAT SIXTY THREE PER CENT OF 
MY CONSTITUENTS WOULD TAKE MORE 
THAN THE GOLDEN HOUR TO GET TO 
HOSPITAL IN THE EVENT OF A STROKE 
OR HEART ATTACK MR. THE PRIME 
MINISTER TAKE A AN INTEREST IN THIS 
MATTER AND WILL HE AGREE TO MEET 
WITH ME AND LOCAL HEALTH 
PROFESSIONALS TO RESOLVE IT I I SHALL LOOK AT WHAT HE SAYS AND THE 
FACTS HE BRINGS BEFORE ME HE HAS 
TO PUT THIS IN ITS PROSPECTIVE WE 
HAVE DOUBLED EXPENDITURE ON THE 
NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE THERE ARE 
THIRTY THOUSAND MORE DOCTORS AND EIGHTY THOUSAND MORE 
NURSES AND MANY HOSPITALS ARE BEING 
BUILT OR REFURBISHED THERE IS MORE 
INVESTMENT THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE 
HEALTH SERVICE IN HIS AREA 
WILL MY RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND 
SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO ROBERT 
MUGABE TO STOP BRUTALISING 
LEGITIMATE OPPOSITION TO LISTEN TO 
THE DEMOCRATIC WILL OF THAT COUNTRY 
AND TO GO 
MR. SPEAKER I AGREE WITH MY 
HONOURABLE FRIEND THAT A MESSAGE 
SHOULD BE SENT FROM THE UNITED 
KINGDOM THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN 
ZIMBABWE FAILING TO ANNOUNCE AN 
ELECTION RESULT TRYING TO RIG AN 
ELECTION RESULT IS UNACCEPTABLE 
AND I CALL ON THE WHOLE WORLD TO 
EXPRESS ITS VIEW THAT THIS IS 
UNACCEPTABLE TO THE WHOLE OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN 
SOUTH AFRICA WHERE THERE IS AN 
ARMS SHIPMENT TRYING TO GET TO 
ZIMBABWE WE WILL PROMOTE PROMOSALS 
FOR AN EMBARGO ON ALL ARMS TO 
ZIMBABWE AND AT THE SAME TIME WE 
ASK ALL THE AFRICAN UNION OBSERVERS 
AND INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS TO MAKE 
THEIR VIEWS KNOWN ABOUT THE 
UNFAIRNESS OF THIS ELECTION 
IF THE PRIME MINISTER WILL NOT SAY 
SORRY FOR THE TEN PENCE TAX FIASCO 
WILL HE NOT APOLOGISE FOR THE 
VOTING DOWN OF THE EARNINGS LINK 
FOR THE STATE PENSION OR IS SORRY 
THE HARDEST WORD 
PERHAPS I COULD 
REMIND HIM IT WAS A CONSERVATIVE 
GOVERNMENT THAT APOLISHED THE 
EARNINGS LINK ON PENSIONS AND 
PERHAPS I CAN ALSO REMIND HIM IT'S 
A LABOUR GOVERNMENT THAT IS 
COMMITTED TO RESTORING IT THE 
REASON IS WE TAKE SERIOUSLY OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE DIGNITY AND 
SECURITY OF EVERYONE IN RETIREMENT 
AND WE WILL RESTORE THE EARNINGS 
LINK FOR PENSIONS 
REMEMBER THE GUESS THE YEAR 
COMPETITION IS NOW CLOSED WE'LL 
HAVE THE RESULTS AT THE END OF THE 
PROGRAMME WE ARE GOING TO HEAR IN 
A SECOND FROM OUR PANEL OF EXPERTS 
ON HOW THAT PMQS WENT BUT FIRST WE 
HEAR WHAT YOU THOUGHT JENNY HAS 
YOUR E. MAILS AS THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S QUESTIONS WAS DOMINATED 
BY THE TAX ISSUE SO THE E. MAILS 
UNSURPRISINGLY IAN WHITELY SAYS HE 
HAS SIMPLE ADVICE FOR GORDON BROWN 
AND MR. DARLING WHY DOESN'T THE 
GOVERNMENT INCREASE THE AMOUNT 
TAKEN BY THE HIGHEST TAX RATE 
SURELY IT'S THE TRUE LABOUR IDEAL 
ANOTHER ONE HERE RAISING THE 
PROSPECT OF THAT NOT ALL OF THE FIVE 
MILLION AFFECTED BY THE ABOLITION 
WOULD BE GAINING UNDER THE NEW 
SUGGESTIONS THEY SAID I WILL NOT 
BENEFIT FROM THE LATEST U. TURN BY 
THE PRIME MINISTER I'M A SINGLE 
FIFTY SIX YEAR OLD WORKS A A SUPPLY 
TEACHER IN SCHOOLS AND I EARN 
THIRTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR MATTHEW FROM YORK 
POINTS OUT THAT SURELY INCREASING 
THE MINIMUM WAGE WHICH IS ONE OF 
THE PROPOSALS TO COUNTER TAXES FOR 
LOW PAID WORKERS WILL INCREASE WAGE 
BILLS FOR BUSINESSES ON SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT NOTE ANOTHER ONE HERE 
THAT WAS UPSET BY LABOUR 
BACKBENCHERS HAR RACKING NICK CLEGG 
OFFERING CONDOLLENCES ABOUT THE 
DEAD SOLDIERS IN IRAQ AND 
AFGHANISTAN ANOTHER ONE HERE 
YOUR PANEL IS BEING INCREDIBLY 
PATRONISING THAT THE ELDERLY IN 
AUTUMN WILL ONLY BE CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE WINTER FUEL ALLOWANCE WE WERE 
ONCE YOUR AGE AND WE ARE STILL ABLE 
TO THINK AND ACT INFORMIVELY WE 
ARE NOT CONCERNED AS MONEY GRABBERS 
OUT TO GET WHAT WE CAN AND TO HELL 
WITH THE REST WILL CONTINUE TO 
LOBBY MY M. P. WHO IS FORTUNATELY 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT BOTH FOR MYSELF 
AND OTHERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
INTERESTING E. MAILS HERE'S A 
POSSIBLE HEADLINE FOR TOMORROW 
MORNING THE LADDIE IS FOR TURNING 
COPY RIGHT THAT 
YOU SHOULD WORK IN 
NEWSPAPERS HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT 
OF THAT 
THE NOT ENOUGH MONEY 
GORDON BROWN WILL FACE HORROND US 
HEADLINES AND COMMENTARY AND HAVING 
DONE A U. TURN IT WILL BE SPECK TACK 
CLARL EMBARRASSING IN WESTMINSTER 
AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THIS IS A U. 
TURN ALTHOUGH HE IS NOT RESTORING 
THE TAX RATE AND AS SOME OF THE E. 
MAILS MAKE CLEAR NOT EVERYONE WHO 
HAS LOST WILL BENEFIT HE SAID 
THERE WASN'T PROBLEM AND HE SAID 
LABOUR M. P.'S WERE NOT CONCERNED HE 
HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THERE IS PROBLEM 
AND COME UP WITH A PACKAGE TO DEAL 
WITH IT AND BUT AND IT IS 
IMPORTANT I COULDN'T HELP NOTICING 
THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE PRIME 
MINISTER IN PRIME MINISTER'S 
QUESTIONS SEEMED HIMSELF HE SEEMED 
PASSIONATE HE SEEMED TO BELIEVE 
WHAT HE THOUGHT 
ARGUING ON HIS 
GROUND TOO 
BECAUSE HE BELIEVES HE 
IS THE ANTI POVERTY CHANCELLOR AND 
NOW MANY PERFECT AND HE BELIEVES 
IT'S A CHEEK FOR THE TORIES TO TAKE 
HIM ON THERE WAS A CURIOUS SENSE I 
HAD OF COMING OUT OF HIMSELF AND 
BELIEVING IN WHAT HE WAS DOG L. 
RECALL ONE OTHER U. TURN WHEN TONY 
BLAIR AGREED TO HAVE A REFERENDUM 
ON THE E. U. LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT 
WHERE IT WENT THEN BUT HE DID IT 
WAS A U. TURN EVERYONE THOUGHT IT 
WAS A HUMILIATION AND THE PUBLIC 
SAID WELL THAT IS A U. TURN IN THE 
RIGHT DIRECTION SO WHY DO WE CARE 
IT'S A U. TURN I'VE NO DOUBT IN THE 
POLITICAL WORLD HUGELY DAMAGING 
BUT IN THE REAL WORLD THE KEY 
QUESTION WILL BE DO PEOPLE THINK 
IT WAS THE RIGHT U. TURN TO MAKE 
AND ARE THEY COMFORTABLE WILL 
WITH HOW THEY ARE OFF IT MAY BE 
THAT SOME GAIN AND SOME DON'T THE THE PERCEPTION OUTSIDE WESTMINSTER 
COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT AND IT'S 
THIS THAT YOU ARE TAKING MONEY 
AWAY FROM ME AND YOU ARE GOING TO 
GIVE IT BACK TO ME IF I FILL IN A 
COMPLICATED TAX CREDIT FORM IT MAY 
LOOK AN ELEGANT SOLUTION IN THE 
LETTER TO JOHN MCFALL AND TO PEOPLE 
LIKE ME AND NICK WHO CAN SEE THE 
SYMMETRY OF IT BUT ORDINARY PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE BEEN AT THE ROUGH END OF 
THIS I THINK MIGHT SEE IT VERY 
DIFFERENTLY 
I AGREE WITH THAT DIFFERENTLY IT'S CERTAINLY CHEERED UP THE 
TROOPS THAT IS FOR SURE 
THAT IS 
MY POINT 
IT COMES DOWN TO THE 
MATHS FIVE MILLION PEOPLE LOW 
PAID PEOPLE LOST ON AVERAGE TWO HUNDRED 
AFTER THE BUDGE BUDGET IF THE 
NEW PACKAGE IS ONE BILLION 
COMPENSATION WHERE IS THE MONEY 
COMING FROM THERE WILL BE A HIDDEN 
COST IF THERE IS A LOT LESS THERE 
WILL BE LOSERS THERE ARE THE 
SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND WOMEN BETWEEN SIXTY AND SIXTY FIVE WHO 
WILL BE PAYING MORE TAX ON THEIR 
PENSION OR LOW EARNINGS THOSE 
PEOPLE UNLESS UNLESS THEY GET A 
TWO HUNDRED INCREASE IN THE WINTER FUEL 
ALLOWANCE WHICH IS INCONCEIVABLE 
THEY WILL BE LIG LOSERS AND THEY 
WILL NOT BE REASSURED BY THE 
PARAPHERNALIA TODAY PATRICIA PATRICIA HEWITT OUTSIDE WESTMINSTER A LOT 
OF OLD PEOPLE ACTUALLY DON'T LIKE 
THE WINTER FUEL ALLOWANCE THEY 
DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT THEY HAVE 
TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE STATE TO 
KEEP THEIR HOUSES WARM THEY WOULD 
RATHER PREFER THE IDEA THAT THEY 
KEEP MORE OF THEIR OWN MONEY THAT 
THEY DON'T PAY IT IN TAX AND THEN 
HAVE TO GO CAP IN HAND TO THE 
GOVERNMENT TO GET THAT MONEY BACK 
IT WON'T BE POPULAR 
THAT IS NOT AT 
ALL WHAT I HEAR FROM MY ON 
CONSTITUENTS 
THAT IS WHAT I HEAR CONSTITUENTS IF I CAN ANSWER YOUR POINT ANDREW 
WHAT MY CONSTITUENTS SAY IS THEY 
LIKE THE WINTER FUEL PAYMENT THEY 
LI KE THE IDEA OF GETTING A CASH 
BONUS F. YOU LIKE LUMP SUM BONUS 
JUST AT THE TIME IN THE WINTER WHEN 
THEY HAVE GOT BIG BILLS AND THEY 
CAN USE IT FOR THAT OR CHRISTMAS 
WHY ARE YOU TAKING THE MONEY AWAY 
IN THE FIRST PLACE 
WHAT YOU HAVE 
TO REMEMBER IS THE GREAT MAJORITY 
OF PENSIONERS ON LOWER INCOMES ARE 
NOT PAYING TAX AT ALL AND INDEED 
THE POOREST PENSIONS OVER SIXTY FIVE OF 
COURSE ARE BEING HELPED THROUGH 
THE PENSION CREDIT SO THAT NOW WE 
CAN GUARANTEE NOBODY OF SIXTY FIVE OR MORE 
NO SINGLE PENSIONER IS LIVING ON 
LESS THAN ONE TWENTY FIVE A WEEK 
THIS GROUP 
OF PEOPLE BETWEEN SIXTY AND SIXTY FIVE THAT DO 
THAT YOU DO TAX SOME PEOPLE MAY 
WONDER WHAT YOU ARE DOING TAXING 
THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU HAVE 
COME UP WITH A SYSTEM WHEREBY THE 
PEOPLE WILL PAY MORE TAX EVEN 
THOUGH THEY ARE AMONG THE POOREST 
IN THE COUNTRY AND PAID TAX ALL 
THEIR LIVES AND NOW YOU ARE SAYING 
WELL WE ARE TAKING IT AWAY BUT 
COME NOVEMBER WE'LL GIVE YOU IT 
BACK IN A FUEL ALLOWANCE YOU WERE 
INDEPENDENT OF THE STATE BEFOREHAND 
WE'LL NOW MAKE YOU BUT WE ARE 
TAXING YOU MORE AND MAKE YOU MORE 
DEPENDENT ON THE STATE CLEARLY CLEARLY THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE REMOVAL 
OF THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE AND THOSE 
WOMEN SIXTY TO SIXTY FOUR WHO ARE NOT 
COVERED BY THE PENSION TAX CREDIT 
ARE A VERY CRITICAL GROUP IN ALL OF 
THIS BUT WHAT IS I THINK SO 
WELCOME ABOUT TODAY'S CHANGE IS THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
THEY HAVE SAID THEY WILL SIT DOWN 
TALK TO THE TREASURY SELECT 
COMMITTEE AMONG OTHERS AND WORK 
OUT WHAT THE BEST WAY IS OF 
ACTUALLY HELPING THOSE LOW PAID 
OLDER WOMEN 
I THINK IT'S A MATTER 
OF PERCEPTION MY CLEANER IS PART 
TIME AND SHE PAYS HER TAX SHE IS 
WORSE OFF AS A RESULT L. HAVE SEEN 
IT ON THIS FORM I HAVE TO FILL IN 
SHE IS WORSE OFF AND WHAT YOU HAVE 
TOLD HER AND SHE DOES EVERYTHING 
RIGHT UP AT SIX IN THE MORNING AND 
WORKS HARD AND HONEST HARD 
WORKING AND SHE IS AN IMMIGRANT A 
CREDIT TO IT COUNTRY YOU NOW TAX 
HER MORE AND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING 
TO HER IS I'M TALKING YOUR MONEY 
AWAY BUT IF YOU SIT DOWN LATE ONE 
NIGHT AFTER AN EXHAUSTING DAY 
CLEANING HOUSES LIKE MINE AND FILL 
IN A HUGE LONG FORM MAYBE YOU'LL 
GET THE MONEY BACK WHERE IS THE 
JUSTICE 
IN THAT 
THE TAX CREDIT 
JUSTICE IN THAT THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM HAS TRANSFORMED THE LIVES OF 
THOUSANDS OF LOW PAID POOR 
FAMILIES AND PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY 
WHY ARE YOU TAKING SAX TAX OF 
SOMEONE WHO EARNS SO LITTLE IN THE 
FIRST PLACE 
WE HAVE TAKEN MILLIONS 
OF PEOPLE OUT OF PAYING TAX AT ALL 
SHE IS NOT ENTITLED TO MOST OF THE 
TAX CREDITS 
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY 
RIGHT WHICH IS WHY WE PUT IN THE 
WORKING TAX CREDIT FOR SINGLE 
PEOPLE WITHOUT CHILDREN BUT 
EXACTLY THE POINT THAT GORDON 
BROWN AND ALISTAIR DARLING 
ACKNOWLEDGED THIS MORNING SOME 
PEOPLE FROM THE SOUND OF IT LIKE 
YOUR CLEANER FOR A VARIETY OF 
REASONS STILL DON'T QUALIFY AND 
CLEARLY WHAT IS COMING IS AN 
EXTENSION OF CREDITS BECAUSE WITH 
THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM NOW IF YOU 
HAVE GOT LET'S SAY ONE PERSON IN 
THE FAMILY EARNING AND ONE OR TWO 
CHILDREN YOU DON'T PAY ANY TAX AT 
ALL UNTIL YOU GET TO TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR 
THAT SYSTEM HAS DONE MORE TO REDUCE 
POVERTY IN OUR COUNTRY THAN 
ANYTHING THAT WENT BEFORE ANYTHING 
THAT THE TEN PENCE CAN DO AND WE 
NEED TO MAKE IT WORK FOR PEOPLE 
LIKE YOUR CLEANER AND SOME OF MY 
CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE BEEN HELPED 
BY THE MINIMUM WAGE HUGELY 
IMPORTANT BUT NOT YET HELPED BY 
TAX CREDITS 
NICK HOW DO YOU THINK 
THIS PLAYS FOR THE TORIES WE HAVE 
SEEN DAVID CAMERON'S PERFORMANCE 
THERE POVERTY THE LOW PAID 
INCENTIVES TAXATION FOR THE LOW 
PAID TAX CREDITS ALL OF THAT 
BUBBLING TO THE SURFACE AS AN ISSUE 
IN OUR SYSTEM HOW DOES THAT WORK 
IN THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN THE TWO 
MAJOR PARTIES 
I THINK WE ARE 
CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO NARRATIVES AT 
THE MOMENT WE ARE NOT QUITE CLEAR 
WHICH ONE IS GOING TO WIN NEXT 
WEEK'S ELECTIONS MAY GIVE US SOME 
INDICATION ONE VIEW AS IT THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS FALLING APART AND 
GORDON BROWN HAS LOST HIS AUTHORITY 
AND TOMORROW'S HEADLINES WILL 
REINFORCE THAT IT'S OVER THE 
TORIES HAVE THE WEIGHT AND IF BORIS 
JOHNSON WINS IN LONDON AND THEY DO 
WELL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY PERHAPS 
THAT WILL BE CONFIRMED THE OTHER 
VIEW IS IT'S BEEN AN AWFULLY BAD 
TIME FOR GOVERNMENT AND THE TORIES 
ARE NOT DOING WELL ENOUGH AND ON 
THE AGENDA THAT GORDON BROWN WANTED 
TO TALK ABOUT THEY HAVEN'T GOT A 
LOT TO SAY THIS IS NOT THEIR 
AGENDA IT'S NOT THEIR ANALYSIS AND 
IF HE WILL FORGIVE ME FLATTERING 
HIM ON THE CRITICISM OF THE ECONOMY 
WITH VINCE CABLE AND THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS THEY HAVE HAD A CLEARER 
MESSAGE THAN THE CONSERVATIVES AND 
WERE BORIS NOT TO WIN NEXT WEEK 
THAT PEOPLE WOULD START TO SAY HOLD 
ON IF YOU CAN'T REALLY WIN AT THIS 
IN OPPOSITION WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
WE ARE TRAPPED THE GREAT THING 
ABOUT MY JOB IS IT'S NOT UP TO ME 
IT'S UP TO THEM OUT THERE HOW THEY 
REACT AND WHERE THEY THINK THEY ARE 
ELECTIONS ARE A GREAT WAY OF 
HIGHLIGHTING IT 
YOU WERE HERE WITH 
US TODAY TO HOLD OUR HAND AND GUIDE 
US THROUGH THE MYSTERIES OF TAX 
CREDITS 
I WOULD DO IT FOR FREE IT CREDITS WAS ENOUGH IN ITSELF TO BE WITH YOU 
YOU MEAN YOU ARE GETTING PAID TO BE 
HERE JENNY AND I WILL NEED TO 
SPEAK TO OUR SHOP STEWARD THANK 
YOU FOR JOINING US IT'S FIVE YEARS 
SINCE THE START OF THE CONFLICT IN 
DARFUR IN WESTERN SUDAN ENTIRE 
VILLAGES HAVE BEEN WIDE OUT AND 
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE KILLED AS FIGHTING 
BETWEEN REBEL GROUPS SECURITY 
FORCES AND THE JANJAWEED MILITIA 
CONTINUES IT'S THE THE LATEST IN A 
BLOODY HISTORY WHICH GANS SOME TWENTY 
YEARS AGO AMONG THE VICTIMS ARE 
FORMER CHILD SOLDIERS WHO WERE 
FORCED TO FIGHT THE SUDANESE 
GOVERNMENT EMMANUEL JAL IS ONE 
SUCH FORMER CHILD SOLDIER 
CONSCRIPTED AT THE AGE OF JUST 
EIGHT NOW A HIP HOP ARTIST HE 
DESCRIBES HIS HORRIFIC EXPERIENCES 
IN MUSIC AND IS URGING THE WORLD TO 
TAKE ACTION 
I BELIEVE I HAVE SURFIEFD FOR 
SURVIVED FOR REASON TO PROTECT LIVE LIVE I BELIEVE I HAVE SURVIVED FOR A 
REASON REASON TO TELL MY STORY TO PROTECT 
LIVES 
THE SINGLE IT'S A SONG 
THAT I'VE WRITTEN TO SHARE MY STORY 
WITH THE WORLD AND LOOKING AT MY 
COUNTRY IT SHOWS THE STRUGGLE OF 
MY PEOPLE AND ALSO IT'S WHAT I 
HAVE EXPERIENCED AS A CHILD L. SAW 
MY VILLAGE BURN L. WITNESSES MY AUNTY RAPED IN FRONT OF ME 
WHAT IS KILLING MY PEOPLE AT THE 
MOMENT IS THE OIL AND THE OIL FROM 
SUDAN CHINA HAS GOT THE LARGEST 
SHARES IS THE ONE WHICH IS 
EXPORTING MORE OF IT AND CHINA IS 
MAKING SUDAN SO STABLE AND THAT IS 
SO DIFFICULT EVEN TO HELP THE 
PEOPLE OF SUDAN BECAUSE THE 
GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN IS BEING BACKED 
UP BY CHINA SO THE BEST MOMENT NOW 
TO SEND MESSAGES TO CHINA BY 
BOYCOTTING THE OLYMPICS WE NEED 
MORE BRAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN STAND UP 
THERE AND TALK TO CHINA AND TELL 
CHINA WE ARE NOT COMING FOR THIS 
ATHLETES BOXERS WE JUST NEED THEM 
NOT TO GO AND THAT WILL BE A CLEAR 
MESSAGE FOR THE MEDIA AND EVERYBODY 
TO KNOW AND RAISE THE PROFILE FOR 
THE PEOPLE OF DARFUR 
LOST MY FATHER HASH 
EMMANUEL JAL IS WITH US NOW 
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME YOU 
TALKED A LITTLE BIT IN THAT SHORT 
FILM ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD IN SUDAN 
TELL US BIT MORE ABOUT IT IF YOU 
CAN YOU WERE CONSCRIPTED TO THE 
ARMY AT THE AGE OF EIGHT YEAH YEAH WHAT HAPPENED IS BECAUSE I 
EXPERIENCED I HAVE SEEN MY HOUSE 
BURN AND WE HAVE BEEN DISPLACED AND 
WE ARE RUNNING HERE AND THERE SO 
WHEN I WENT TO ETHIOPIA AND I 
AGREED TO BE TRAINED BECAUSE THERE 
IS NOTHING THAT I WAS GOING TO LOSE 
SO BECAUSE I WANTED TO REVENGE FOR 
MY FAMILY AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE 
MY MUM IS L. WAS LATER TOLD MY MUM 
IS DEAD AND MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS 
WERE DISPLACE AND DISPLACED AND 
WE ARE TOLD THIS IS A WAR TO KEEP 
THE CULTURE AND OUR FREEDOM 
AND YOU WERE IN THE ARMY FOR ABOUT 
FIVE YEARS WAS IT 
I WOULD SAY 
FOUR YEARS APPROXIMATELY FIVE 
YEARS YEARS THEN WHAT HAPPENED 
THERE WAS A 
SPLIT BETWEEN THE S. P. L. A. 
THE SSPLA 
IT WAS A CIVIL WAR SO I DECIDED ME AND SOME FELLOW FOUR HUNDRED CHILD 
SOLDIERS AND FEW ADULTS AND WE 
ESCAPED BECAUSE WE WANTED TO GO AND 
PROTECT OUR VILLAGES L. WANTED TO 
FIND OUT ABOUT MY FAMILY BUT I 
DIDN'T END UP GOING THERE BECAUSE 
THE WORK FINISHED US BECAUSE A LOT 
OF PEOPLE DIED ON THE JOURNEY AND 
WE ENDED UP BEING SIXTEEN PEOPLE FROM 
FOUR HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED AND YOU ARE TWELVE AND THIRTEEN 
I WAS TWELVE 
WHEN I ESCAPED YEAH 
WHAT HAPPENED WHERE DID YOU GO 
FROM THERE 
I ENDED UP IN A PLACE 
WHERE I GOT RESCUED BY A BRITISH 
AID WORKER WHO SMUGGLED ME TO KENYA 
AND LATER DIED FROM THERE MY 
WORLD CRASHED AND I STARTED 
COLLECTING MYSELF 
YOU CAME OVER TO BRITAIN AND NOW 
YOU DO YOUR HIP HOP MUSIC AND YOU 
TRY TO BRING THIS ISSUE TO A WIDER 
AUDIENCE BECAUSE YOU FEEL 
PASSIONATELY DON'T YOU THAT THESE 
PROBLEMS ARE STILL ONGOING YES YES THE MUSIC ALBUM THAT I'M RELEASING 
NOW IT'S ABOUT MY STORY IT IS 
ABOUT THE STRUGGLE FOR THE PEOPLE 
IT IS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE 
AND WHAT FRUSTRATES ME IS HOW THE 
WORLD HAS TURNED THEIR BACK ON US 
WHICH OTHER PEOPLE ARE 
SUFFERINGMENT PEOPLE HAVE GONE TO 
HELP THE PEOPLE IN IRAQ BUT WE 
HAVE EVIDENCE OF PEOPLE BEING 
KILLED EVERY DAY AND FOR ALL THE 
CHARITIES THAT WE SEE THAT SHOWS 
PICTURES OF KIDS SKINNY PEOPLE 
STARVING MOST OF THE PICTURES ARE 
FROM SUDAN AND NOW WE HAVE DARFUR 
THAT IS DYING ON OUR EYES PEOPLE 
ARE FOCUSING ON ZIMBABWE AND AND 
PEOPLE ARE FOCUSING ON DIFFERENT 
PLACES BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE BEING 
KILLED IT IS SO BAD WHEN YOU ARE 
CRYING OUT TO TELL PEOPLE TO HELP 
YOU AND THEY ARE TURNING THEIR EYE 
I SAY IT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN 
PEOPLE AND IT LET'S ME DO IT 
THROUGH THE MUSIC MOBILISE THE 
PEOPLE AND CREATE THE AWARENESS AND 
THE GOVERNMENTS WILL HELP 
PATRICIA HEWITT ONE OF THE 
SUGGESTIONS IS THAT ATHLETES 
BOYCOTT THE OLYMPIC GAMES BECAUSE 
HE SAYS THE CHINESE ARE PART OF THE 
PROBLEM DO YOU AGREE WE SHOULD BE 
BRAVER ABOUT THIS TAKING A STAND 
AND BOYCOTTING THE GAMES 
I AM NOT 
IN A FAVOUR OF A BOYCOTT OF THE 
GAMES MYSELF L. THINK IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT WE DRAW CHINA INTO 
THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY AND USE THAT 
TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEM OVER THEIR 
HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD TIBET IN 
PARTICULAR BUT ALSO WORK WITH THEM 
TO TRY AND PERSUADE THEM TO SUPPORT 
CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT 
IN AFRICA WHICH OF COURSE WHAT 
OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DOING NOT 
JUST IN SUDAN BUT IN OTHER PARTS 
OF THE AFRICA AS WELL 
HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE IN IN DARFUR 
WILL HAVE TO DIE WHILE YOU ARE 
DOING THAT 
WE CAN'T I AM AFRAID 
SAY THE FIGHTING HAS TO STOP THERE 
HAS TO BE PEACE IN DARFUR IT IS 
HORRIFIC WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE 
TONY BLAIR TOLD ME ON THIS 
PROGRAMME SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT 
AFTER OUR FAILURE IN RWANDA WE 
WOULD NEVER LET ANOTHER RWANDA 
HAPPEN DARFUR IS ANOTHER RWANDA 
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE BEEN WORKING 
WITH THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
DID HE LIE TO ME DID HE MAKE IT 
UP 
ANDREW THAT'S 
BUT WE LET UP ANOTHER RWANDA HAPPEN 
AND YOU ARE GOING ON WITH 
RESOLUTION WITH THE CHINESE WHEN 
THEY KEEP THE SUDAN GOVERNMENT 
GOING THEY STOP EVERYTHING ON THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL OF THE UN AND 
THEY SEND ARMS TO ROBERT MUGABE 
WHERE IS YOUR CONFLICT RESOLUTION 
WE HAVE GOT TO GET IN THERE AND 
KEEP WORKING WITH WITH AFRICAN 
COLLEAGUES AND SECURITY COUNCIL 
COLLEAGUES AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 
UNITED NATIONS TO STOP THE HORROR 
IN DARFUR 
VINCE CABLE 
THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO AND GET THE 
HUMANITARIAN AID IN 
DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS 
DOING ENOUGH 
ON THE OLYMPICS I 
AGRE A AGREE WITH PATRICIA 
TELLING THE SPORTSMAN ISN'T A 
SENSIBLE WAY 
WE SHOULDN'T BE SUPPORTING THE 
SYMBOLS AROUND THE GAMES THAT IS 
SOMETHING WE SHOULD OPT OUT OF IN 
TERMS OF THE CONFLICT ON THE GROWN 
IT IS DIFFICULT THE REBEL 
MOVEMENTS ARE SPLIT THERE IS A 
CIVIL WAR IN CHAD AND IN THE 
CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO GET A HANDLE ON WHO IS 
FIGHTING WHOM IT IS ABOUT GIVING 
AIR COVER TO THE AFRICAN FORCES WHO 
ARE TRYING TO HOLD A RING 
EXTRAORDINARY DIFFICULT AND WE 
SHOULD BE MORE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN 
IT IT WHAT WE ARE FORGETTING IS SUDAN IS 
BUYING ARMS FROM CHINA BUT WE HAVE 
A MASSIVE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TELLING 
CHINA AND CHINA WILL BE SAYING THAT 
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S RIGHT 
IF WE HAVE BRAVE PEOPLE WHO TAKE IT 
UPON THEMSELVES TO SAY O. K. LET THE 
BRITISH GOVERNMENT LOBBY BUT I AM 
NOT GOING TO DO THIS THAT WILL 
DRAW MEDIA ATTENTION AND MORE 
PEOPLE WILL GET TO HEAR THIS AND 
THEY WILL SAY IT IS SOMETHING 
SERIOUS AND WHEN A MASSIVE NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE PEOPLE GATHERED DEMANDING 
SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT WILL DO 
SOMETHING AND JUST LIKE WHEN THERE 
WAS GENOCIDE IN GERMANY YOUNG 
PEOPLE UNIVERSITIES STARTED IT 
LOBBYING THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S 
WHY SOUTH AFRICA IS THE PLACE IT IS 
NOW BECAUSE AND THAT'S WHY I'M 
SUGGESTING SUGGESTING HOPEFULLY YOUR MUSIC WILL HELP 
INSPIRE THAT AS WELL 
EMMANUEL JAL THANK YOU FOR COMING 
IN TO TO TALK TO US 
THANK YOU 
SOMETIMES WE TALK ABOUT ISSUES THAT 
PUT THE THE OTHER ISSUES INTO 
PROSPECTIVE AND THERE IS NO BIGGER 
THAN DARFUR TODAY
