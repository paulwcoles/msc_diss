I'D LIKE TO GET HOLD OF IT AND THROW IT THROUGH THE WINDOW 
AND SAFFY IS A PAMPERED DELINQUENT BITCH 
SAFFY IS DEFINITELY A NIGHTMARE 
SPOILT BRAT WITH SERIOUS BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMS 
THE OWNERS OF THESE DOGS ARE AT THEIR WITS' END 
IT'S TIME FOR EXTREME MEASURES 
THIS IS THE LAST RESORT FOR BAD DOGS 
SET UP ON A SECURE TEN ACRE COMPOUND 
IN A REMOTE PART OF THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
DOG BORSTAL IS RUN BY THREE OF BRITAIN'S TOUGHEST TRAINERS 
IT'S NOT THE SIZE OF THE DOG IT'S THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM 
EACH TRAINER WILL TAKE ON ONE DOG AND ATTEMPT TO REFORM THEM 
IN JUST FOUR DAYS USING THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL TRAINING METHODS 
MY MISSION IS TO TEACH OWNERS 
TO TEACH DOGS WHO'S BOSS 
BUT TO REFORM BAD DOGS THEY NEED TO TACKLE THEIR OWNERS 
FOR THESE DOGS 
DELINQUENCY IS ABOUT TO BECOME A THING OF THE PAST 
LINDA AND JOHN HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR TWO YEARS 
BUT LINDA AND DILLON HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR FIVE 
THEY'RE LOCKED IN A LOVE TRIANGLE THAT'S HEADING FOR HEARTBREAK 
LINDA LOVES THEM BOTH 
BUT FOR DILLON THREE'S A CROWD 
HOUNDING JOHN OUT OF HIS OWN BEDROOM 
DILLON IS PUSHING HIS OWNER'S RELATIONSHIP ONTO THE ROCKS 
WHY TAKE THE DOG TO BED WITH YOU WHY NOT LEAVE IT HERE BECAUSE DILLON 
NO I'M ASKING A QUESTION WHY NOT LEAVE THE DOG DOWNSTAIRS SO THAT WHEN I COME UP TO BED 
HE'D WHINGE DOWNSTAIRS HOW DO YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T SETTLE DOWNSTAIRS 
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SETTLE THAT'S WHY 
JOHN'S JUST GETTING MORE ARGUMENTATIVE WITH ME BECAUSE OF THE DOG 
BEDTIME BATTLES ARE DILLON'S SPECIALITY 
IT'S A STAND OFF TO SEE WHO GETS TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH LINDA AND THERE'S ONLY EVER ONE WINNER 
EVERY NIGHT OF THE WEEK THAT'S WHAT I'VE TO PUT UP WITH 
WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP HAVE ME AND HER GOT I MIGHT AS WELL BE ON ME OWN 
AT THE END OF THE DAY EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THEIR PURPOSES IN A RELATIONSHIP 
AND OBVIOUSLY OUR SEX LIFE IS NON EXISTENT BECAUSE OF THE DOG 
NO COME HERE NO NO NO 
I'VE ALWAYS DREADED THE THOUGHT THAT I'D HAVE TO HAVE HIM PUT DOWN 
BECAUSE HE'D BITE AND HE HAS BIT HIM NOW 
I DON'T SLEEP IN THE ROOM FIVE NIGHTS OUT OF SEVEN 
BECAUSE THE DOG IS THAT BAD 
AND LINDA WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
IT'S GOT BEYOND A JOKE I'M SORRY TO SAY 
THERE COULD BE A DAY WHERE HE'D SAY 
JUST LEAVE IT'S EITHER THE DOG OR ME 
I KNOW WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO I'D LIKE TO GET HOLD OF IT AND THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW 
LITERALLY PICK IT UP BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK WHICH I COULD DO VERY EASILY AND THROW IT THROUGH THAT WINDOW 
DILLON'S DIVIDED THE FAMILY 
LINDA'S FACING A CHOICE 
JOHN OR DILLON 
DESPERATE TIMES CALL FOR DESPERATE MEASURES DOG BORSTAL 
DILLON'S BORSTAL TRAINER IS EXPERT BEHAVIOURIST ROBERT ALLEYNE 
ROBERT TEACHES OWNERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR DOGS 
WITH THE UNHAPPY WIGAN THREE HE HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT 
GOOD MORNING 
YOU MUST BE JOHN PLEASED TO MEET YOU I'M ROB 
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME THIS WEEK I'M AFRAID YOU MUST BE LINDA HOW DO 
THIS IS DILLON THAT'S WHAT HE THINKS OF YOUR DRIVING 
DOG IN O. K. NOW AS YOU COME IN THIS IS DILLON'S KENNEL IT'S GOT NUMBER ONE ON IT 
YOUR FACE 
IF A FACE COULD TELL A STORY HE'LL GET LOST IN THERE 
O. K. SO THIS WILL BE WHERE HE'LL STAY FOR THE NEXT FOUR DAYS 
NO IN DILLON IN IN IN IN 
MAKE SURE IT'S LOCKED YEAH GOOD 
DILLON AND LINDA HAVEN'T SPENT A NIGHT APART FOR YEARS 
WANT ME TO GET A TISSUE I'VE GOT ONE I'VE GOT ONE 
DILLON'S OWNERS WILL BE SPENDING THEIR FIRST NIGHT ALONE FOR MONTHS IN BORSTAL'S BASIC ACCOMMODATION 
OH MY GOD I THOUGHT THERE WAS A SPIDER ON MY HEAD THEN 
FELT SUMMAT CRAWLING OH GOD 
OH MY GOD 
NO LECCY IS THERE 
I'VE COME TO HELL 
I DIDN'T THINK IT'D BE LIKE THIS I THOUGHT IT'D BE A BIT BETTER THAN THAT 
THE FINAL REPROBATE ON REMAND IS IN THE UNCOMPROMISING HANDS OF EX POLICE DOG TRAINER MIC MARTIN 
MIC HAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS' EXPERIENCE TRAINING AGGRESSIVE DOGS THIS WEEK 
HE'S HOPING FOR A SERIOUS CHALLENGE 
I'M THINKING THEY'VE GOT ME A GERMAN SHEPHERD BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD ONE YET 
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO TODAY SO GOOD BRING IT ON 
IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE IF THERE'S ONE THING MIC HATES IT'S PAMPERED PUGS 
HELL 
IT'S GOT A COAT ON HELLO 
WERE YOU NOT EXPECTING THIS NO 
YOU KNEW DIDN'T YOU 
JUST LET'S SAY I'M GONNA GET YOU BACK FOR THIS 
HELL 
AND SAFFY REALLY IS ONE EXCESSIVELY PAMPERED PUG 
WHICH ONE 
ANYTHING SAFFY WANTS SHE GETS 
WE'LL HAVE THE PURPLE ONE 
THEN OF COURSE THERE'S HER MANICURES AND SPA SESSIONS 
YES BUT SHE'S GOT TO BE PRETTY HOW CAN YOU MAKE THAT FACE PRETTY 
OWNER LEXI CAN'T RESIST LAVISHING VAST AMOUNTS OF CASH AND ATTENTION ON HER PRIDE AND JOY 
OOH YOU SMELL LOVELY NOW 
BUT SAFFY'S NO LADY OH SAFF 
JUST FOUND OUT SHE'S DESTROYED THE SOFA 
DESTROYED THE BED SHE'S CHEWED THE SKIRTING BOARD SHE'S CHEWED MY CAR KEYS 
SHE'S CHEWED MY SHOES 
SAFFY IS DEFINITELY A NIGHTMARE A SPOILT BRAT WITH SERIOUS BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMS 
A STROLL AROUND CLAPHAM COMMON IS NO WALK IN THE PARK 
I CAN'T REALLY TAKE HER OFF THE LEAD SHE'D NEVER COME BACK TO ME IF I CALLED HER 
COME HERE 
SAFFY 
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE'D HAVE THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF RESPECT FOR ME BUT SHE JUST BLATANTLY DOESN'T 
COME HERE 
MUMMY'S GOING TO GET ANGRY 
COME HERE 
IT'S BEYOND THE SHE'S REALLY CUTE SHE'LL GET OVER IT STAGE 
IT IS TIME TO STOP 
SO ANDREW'S SENDING HIS TWO FAVOURITE GIRLS TO DOG BORSTAL 
GOT WATER GOT A LITTLE BED TAKE THE THING OFF STRAIGHT IN 
STRAIGHT OUT 
DOG BORSTAL IS RUN WITH MILITARY PRECISION 
DILLON'S LOVE RIVAL JOHN HAS BEEN ASSIGNED ALL DILLON'S KENNEL DUTIES 
BUT NO NONSENSE MIC HAS OTHER PLANS FOR SAFFY'S OWNER 
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE LAUGH AT YOU WHEN YOU GO OUT WITH THE COAT ON YOUR DOG 
I DON'T CARE I KNOW BUT DO YOU THINK THEY DO PROBABLY 
DO YOU THINK OTHER DOGS TAKE THE OUT OF YOUR DOG 
NO I THINK THEY'RE JEALOUS DO YOU REALLY 
TREATING DOGS LIKE HUMANS IS MIC'S PET HATE 
SO HE GIVES LEXI A TASTE OF HER OWN MEDICINE 
I WANT YOU TO WEAR THAT FOR ME PLEASE OH WOW 
THAT'S GREAT GOOD 
SAFFY'S OWNER WILL BE THE ONE DRESSED UP FOR THE REST OF THE DAY 
I LOOK LIKE A 
AND DRESSING MY DOG THE WAY I DO OBVIOUSLY MAKES HER LOOK LIKE A BIT OF A 
SO STOP DRESSING YOUR DOG 
DILLON AND SAFFY ARE IN FOR A TOUGH WEEK 
LITTLE SHITSZU DILLON IS DOING TIME FOR AGGRESSIVE ATTACKS AGAINST LOVE RIVAL JOHN 
I NEED JOHN TO START TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE NEEDS TO MAKE DILLON LIKE HIM 
SAFFY STANDS ACCUSED OF GROSS MISCONDUCT 
COME HERE 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE JUST LET HER OFF THE LEAD 
YOU KNOW IF THIS WAS A REAL ROAD AND THERE WAS CARS HERE IT'S HAD IT 
THE DOGS HAVE SPENT THEIR FIRST NIGHT IN THE KENNELS 
THE OWNERS RISE AT THE CRACK OF DAWN 
IN YOU COME HELLO 
JOHN COME OUT HERE WITH ME LINDA STAY WHERE YOU ARE 
CANINE SHRINK ROBERT WANTS TO START BY SEEING HOW JOHN INTERACTS WITH DILLON 
DILLON COME ON DILLON COME ON 
COME ON BOY DILLON COME ON 
DILLON'S NOT CONVINCED HIS ENEMY REALLY WANTS TO PLAY 
DILLON COME ON THROW IT UP AND DOWN IN THE AIR 
COME ON DILLON 
COME ON DILLON 
COME ON DILLON 
GOOD BOY TELL HIM HE'S A GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY 
FETCH IT GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY DILLON DILLON COME ON COME ON 
JOHN'S FAILED TO PERSUADE DILLON HE'S A FUN PLAYMATE 
DON'T TOUCH HIM DON'T LOOK AT HIM LINDA 
O. K. SO I THINK THAT WAS QUITE TELLING WHAT IT SAYS IS AT THE MOMENT YOU REPRESENT THE FUN 
I WANNA PLAY WITH YOU YOU REPRESENT THE COMPETITION DON'T WANNA PLAY WITH YOU 
AND THE WAY YOU SAID IT SUGGESTED TO HIM THAT WAS WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN 
INSTEAD OF TRIPS TO THE SPA 
MIC'S GOING TO TEACH OWNER LEXI A MORE HANDS ON APPROACH 
I THINK THE DAYS OF HER LYING ON A SUN LOUNGER WITH COTTON WOOL BETWEEN HER TOES ARE PROBABLY GONE 
CONFIDENT HE'S MADE HIS POINT MIC DECIDES TO GET STRAIGHT INTO RECALL TRAINING 
WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN IF WE JUST LET HER OFF THE LEAD 
I'D START PANICKING WHY BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WON'T COME BACK IF SHE STARTS RUNNING 
YOU'VE GOT THAT NOW HAVEN'T YOU GO AND WALK OFF OVER THERE 
USING A PENCIL CASE STUFFED WITH TREATS LEXI CAN REWARD SAFFY WHEN 
SHE DOES AS SHE'S TOLD REINFORCING GOOD BEHAVIOUR SAFFY 
NOW THE OTHER WAY 
NOW GO ONTO ONE KNEE 
GET UP AND RUN AWAY FROM HER 
NOW GO DOWN 
GET A LITTLE TREAT READY 
PUT YOUR HAND OUT LIKE THIS 
JUST WAIT WAIT THIS IS THE BIT THAT'S HARD WAIT 
NOW HOLD THE COLLAR WITH THE OTHER HAND AS YOU FEED HER 
BUT IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN A FEW TREATS TO GET SAFFY ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW 
IT'S LIKE A MAD DOG 
WE TRIED TO LET DOG OFF LEAD AND IT WASN'T THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN 
IT WAS RUNNING AROUND LIKE A BIT OF A SO GOTTA WORK ON THAT 
THAT'S A BIG ONE YOU KNOW IF THIS IS A REAL ROAD AND THERE'S CARS HERE IT'S HAD IT 
DILLON'S FOULED HIS KENNEL AND AS USUAL JOHN'S ON DUTY 
JOHN WON'T BE VERY HAPPY CLEANING THE DOG'S MESS UP NOW 
WON'T BE HAPPY AT ALL 
BUT JOHN'S SEEING IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY RATHER THAN A CHORE 
THE DOG'S ALWAYS USED TO SEEING LINDA 
AND NOT ME SO 
IT MIGHT BE A BONDING THING FOR ME AND THE DOG HIYA DILL 
YOU BEING A MESS 
BEEN DOING A MESS 
ROBERT'S KEEN TO MAKE THE MOST OF JOHN'S NEW ATTITUDE IN THEIR NEXT SESSION 
JOHN CAN YOU GO AND SIT ON THAT CHAIR FOR ME PLEASE 
I WANT YOU CALL HIM IN A WAY THAT LETS HIM KNOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING HE WANTS 
GOOD BOY THAT SORT OF TONE JUST CALL HIM NOW FOR ME DILLON 
TO ALTER THE PECKING ORDER JOHN NEEDS TO CHANGE HIS APPROACH 
DILLON NEEDS TO THINK OF JOHN AS A PROVIDER OF GOOD THINGS 
LET HIM SEE THAT YOU STILL HAVE SOME MORE 
DON'T GIVE IT TO HIM O. K. CALL HIM FOR ME NOW LINDA 
COME ON GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
COME ON COME ON DILLON 
SUDDENLY NOW DILLON'S DECIDED HE WANTS TO BE WITH DAD AND THIS IS 
THE PRINCIPLE OF RECALL THE DOG SAYS WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME 
YOU'RE TAKING CONTROL OF THE DOG 
AND HE'S BECOMING CONDITIONED TO DOING WHAT YOU TELL HIM 
I WANT HIM WANTING TO INTERACT WITH YOU RATHER THAN JUST ACCEPTING THAT 
HE HAS TO AND THAT WILL MAKE YOUR RELATIONSHIP A LOT STRONGER 
FINALLY DILLON SEEMS TO BE RESPONDING TO JOHN 
BUT WILL THE OLD RIVALRY RESURFACE WHEN LINDA'S IN THE PICTURE 
HIYA LOVE GOD WE'RE GETTING MORE KISSES TODAY THAN ANYTHING 
DON'T LOOK AT HIM DON'T LOOK AT HIM JOHN CARRY ON DOING EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
NOBODY LOOK AT HIM 
TALK TO EACH OTHER STAY IN EXACTLY THAT POSITION 
YOU'RE GOING TO STAY HERE UNTIL HE STOPS 
DILLON ISN'T GIVING UP HIS ALPHA STATUS QUIETLY 
THIS MIGHT LOOK A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE BUT I WANT HIM TO GET PAID FOR STOPPING 
I WANT HIM TO THINK HE'S GETTING NO RESPONSE WHATSOEVER 
O. K. JOHN NOW STAND UP TELL HIM HE'S A GOOD BOY GIVE HIM A PIECE OF FOOD 
SIT DOWN SIT GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
EASY 
GOOD BOY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DIDN'T STOP 
UNTIL HE STOPPED BARKING BECAUSE OTHERWISE WHAT WE'D DO IS REWARD HIM FOR BARKING 
ANDREW'S ARRIVED AT BORSTAL 
TO SEE HOW HIS SPOILT PRINCESS IS GETTING ON 
I'M EXPECTING A BIT OF PROGRESS NOT A LOT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY BEEN A DAY 
BUT IF THE DOG STAYS WHERE IT'S MEANT TO BE IF IT COMES WHEN YOU CALL HER 
IF WE CAN LET HER OFF THE LEAD 
IF MIC'S MANAGED TO DO THAT THEN I'LL BE IMPRESSED 
MIC'S NOT HAVING MUCH LUCK 
BUT DESPITE HER DEFIANCE HE'S CONVINCED THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT SAFFY 
I'VE GOT AN IDEA THIS DOG'S GONNA SEARCH 
IF I COULD GET THAT DOG SEARCHING THAT'D BE A FIRST WOULDN'T IT 
A PUG THAT SEARCHES 
MIC'S STRATEGY IS TO CHANNEL SAFFY'S HYPERACTIVITY 
INTO A CHALLENGING SEARCH AND RECALL TASK 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET IN THERE QUICK HIDE THE THING COME BACK 
AS SOON AS THE DOG'S GOT IT 
IT'S A RECALL AND A RETREAT AND EVERYTHING LET'S DO IT 
THAT'S IT THAT'S IT NOW GO 
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE THEME 
FETCH IT FETCH IT 
PUGS CAN HAVE BREATHING DIFFICULTIES 
SO TURNING SAFFY INTO A SNIFFER DOG IS A BIG ASK 
GET READY NOW COME CALL HER 
COME COME 
SHE LOOKS LIKE A NATURAL 
COME COME 
COME ON 
FETCH FETCH IT 
FETCH IT 
GOOD GIRL GOOD GIRL 
GOOD 
THAT LOOKED GOOD 
THEY MAY HAVE MADE PROGRESS BUT NO ONE CAN AFFORD TO REST ON THEIR LAURELS 
IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE INMATES MUST PASS A TEST TO PROVE THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR WICKED WAYS 
DILLON WHO'S THIS 
HIYA 
FIRST ON THE TRAINING FIELD IS SAFFY 
SINCE HER SNIFF OF SUCCESS 
MIC'S DECIDED THERE'S NOTHING THIS PUG CAN'T DO 
HE THINKS AGILITY COULD BE THE PERFECT WAY 
TO REDIRECT SAFFY'S ENERGIES AWAY FROM HER DESTRUCTIVE TENDENCIES 
COME ON SAFFY UP GOOD GIRL 
I LIKE THE WAY THE DOG WANTS TO PULL INTO THE THINGS 
COS IT ACTUALLY REALLY LIKES DOING IT 
COME ON UP GOOD GIRL 
MIC CAN'T RESIST ATTEMPTING THE IMPOSSIBLE 
NOW GO UP 
UP GOOD GIRL CONCENTRATE GET HER TO LOOK 
COME ON NOW GO 
SAFFY UP 
GOOD GIRL 
THAT'S SO COOL 
THAT IS MASSIVE 
THAT'S MASSIVE WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW HIGH YOUR DOG IS AND HOW BIG THAT IS 
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE GERMAN SHEPHERDS DO THAT 
DILLON AND JOHN ARE SCHEDULED FOR THEIR FINAL TRAINING SESSION 
GOOD BOY DILLON 
GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY IT WAS VERY GOOD THAT 
THAT'S THE BEST HE'S BEEN SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE 
WHEN I PICKED HIM UP HE EVEN INTERACTED 
HE'S BARKING AT ME 
THIS IS HOW HE IS WHEN LINDA GREETS HIM 
COME ON DILL GOOD BOY 
WAIT WAIT WAIT 
THE BREAKTHROUGH IS JUST WHAT ROBERT HOPED FOR 
NOW HE CAN STEP THINGS UP A STAGE 
GOOD BOY COME AND JUST WALK AWAY 
GOOD BOY COME ON 
THIS IS JUST LIKE HEELWORK WHERE YOU'RE IN CONTROL OF IT 
YOU'RE TELLING HIM WHAT YOU WANT HIM TO DO RATHER THAN RELYING ON HIM TO MAKE THE DECISIONS 
I THINK THIS WILL BE A REALLY GOOD EGO BOOST FOR JOHN 
IT WILL HELP ESTABLISH IN HIM THAT DILLON HAS SOME INTEREST 
I THINK HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE YEAH BUT HE ONLY HAS INTEREST COS OF THE FOOD 
AND I'M HAVING A BIT OF TROUBLE GETTING JOHN TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT 
THAT IF HE MAKES HIMSELF MORE ATTRACTIVE TO THE DOG 
THE DOG'S MUCH MORE LIKELY TO PAY ATTENTION 
I DELIBERATELY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING 
I THOUGHT I'LL LET YOU DO IT IN YOUR OWN TIME AND SEE WHAT YOU DO 
OBSERVING JOHN'S PROGRESS LINDA CAN'T BELIEVE HER EYES 
I'M MADE UP 
I REALLY REALLY AM 
GOD HE'S EVEN FUSSING HIM 
COME ON DILL WALKIES 
THE ACID TEST IS WHETHER DILLON WILL STILL BE INTERESTED IN JOHN'S CHOPPED HAM 
WHEN LINDA'S IN THE EQUATION YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN YOU'RE JUST OUT FOR A WALK 
COME ON 
HE'S DOING NICE RECALLS I HAVE TO SAY 
AND DOING IT FOR JOHN TOO IT WAS JOHN THAT CALLED HIM 
GOOD BOY 
SHE GAVE JOHN A PAT ON THE BACK 
JOHN'S GOING GOOD BOY TO DILLON 
AND LINDA'S GOING GOOD BOY TO JOHN 
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED NOW TWICE IN A ROW THEY'VE CALLED HIM AND NOT FED HIM 
IT WENT VERY WELL 
BASICALLY I COULDN'T GIVE A REALLY BEFORE 
PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT THE DOG PICKED UP ON 
AND NOW I'M GIVING IT A BIT OF ATTENTION AND IT COULD BE MY DOG 
IT IS MY DOG AS MUCH AS LINDA'S NOW 
IT'S JUDGMENT DAY 
WILL THE BORSTAL DOGS GO HOME WITH FLYING COLOURS OR WITH THEIR TAILS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS 
KENDAL SHEPHERD HAS TRAINED DOGS FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS 
IT'S DOWN TO HER TO DECIDE WHETHER THE DOGS MAKE THE GRADE 
DILLON AND HIS OWNERS ARE PREPARING FOR THEIR TEST 
THAT'S IT 
BEFORE THEY CAME TO BORSTAL 
THEY WERE LOCKED IN A LOVE TRIANGLE 
THAT LEFT RIVAL JOHN OUT IN THE COLD 
WILL DILLON BE ABLE TO SHOW HE'S CHANGED WHEN HE'S PUT TO THE TEST 
HOW WILL HE BEHAVE WHEN JOHN AND LINDA SIMULATE AN EVENING AT HOME ON THE SOFA 
HIYA 
DOWN DILLON GO ON DOWN GO ON DOWN 
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO DID YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY 
I'M EXHAUSTED OOH 
DILLON STOP IT STOP IT 
GOOD SIT THAT'S GREAT 
WELL I THINK WE CAN CALL THAT A SUCCESS YES EXCELLENT 
BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE STAKES ARE RAISED 
DILLON BED TIME BED TIME 
YOU LIE ON THERE YOU LIE ON THERE 
WILL DILLON LET JOHN GET INTO BED WITH LINDA 
SOMETHING HE'S NEVER ALLOWED BEFORE 
LET'S GET IT ON BY MARVIN GAYE 
STAY DOWN THERE STAY DOWN THERE DILLON 
NOT A MURMUR 
DOWN DILLON DILLON DOWN DOWN 
HELLO 
RIGHT I'M SURE YOU'RE DYING TO KNOW HOW YOU'VE DONE 
YEAH YOU'VE DONE REALLY WELL YOU SCORED NINETY THREE MARKS OUT OF ONE HUNDRED 
OH MY GOD O. K. SO THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A DISTINCTION 
WELL DONE 
THAT'S GREAT THAT'S FANTASTIC 
IT'S GREAT 
THAT'S HAPPY 
CRYING WITH LAUGHTER 
DILLON DAD'S CRYING 
WHAT'S THIS GIVE US A KISS 
LAST UP IS SAFFY 
A WEEK AGO SAFFY WAS A SPOILT HYPERACTIVE BITCH 
DRIVING HER OWNERS TO DISTRACTION 
COME HERE 
WILL MIC'S NEW FAVOURITE SUPERDOG SHOW SHE'S CHANGED HER ERRANT WAYS 
GOOD GIRL 
THE TRUE TEST OF SAFFY'S OBEDIENCE AND LEXI'S HANDLING 
WILL BE SHOWN IN A ROUND OF AGILITY 
GOOD BOY CLEARED IT 
UP GOOD GIRL 
ANOTHER TWO BARS GOOD BOY 
NOW THIS IS THE BIG ONE THREE BAR JUMP 
CLEARED IT WENT RIGHT OVER IT 
FOR A LITTLE DOG THAT WAS SUPERB 
WHY WOULD THEY WANNA PUT A PINK JACKET ON IT AND WALK DOWN THE STREET WITH THE DOG LIKE THAT 
WHEN THEY CAN SEE WHAT IT CAN DO THIS IS A PROPER DOG IT'S JUST VERY VERY SMALL 
MIC HAS SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN SAFFY THAT FOR THE FINAL STAGES OF HER TEST 
HE'S SET UP THE MOST CHALLENGING CONDITIONS EVER SEEN AT BORSTAL 
HE'S RECREATED ALL THE DISTRACTIONS OF HER LOCAL COMMON 
IN THE FIRST EXERCISE SAFFY MUST WALK TO HEEL 
COME ON GOOD GIRL 
COME ON HEEL HEEL SAFFY 
THE DISTRACTIONS ARE PROVING TOO MUCH 
COME ON SAFFY COME ON 
SAFFY SAFFY 
I THOUGHT IT LOOKED ALL RIGHT IT WASN'T FANTASTIC 
IT HASN'T DENTED MIC'S CONFIDENCE IN SUPERPUG SAFFY'S ABILITY 
TO COMPLETE THE FINAL PART OF HER TEST THE RECALL 
IT'S GOING TO RUN THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE FOOTBALL MATCH THROUGH EVERYTHING 
PAST THE SKATEBOARDERS PAST THE BIKES PAST EVERYTHING 
COME ON 
COME 
YEAH THAT'S O. K. 
COME 
VERY GOOD EXCELLENT 
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH HAS SAFFY BROUGHT HOME HER DISTINCTION O. K. 
I'M SURE YOU'RE LONGING TO KNOW HOW YOU'VE DONE YOU'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS WITH HER YEAH 
SHE HAS PASSED IT WAS SEVENTY SEVEN OUT OF ONE HUNDRED 
YOU NARROWLY MISSED DOING IT WITH DISTINCTION 
THE CONTROLLED WALKING ON THE LEAD WAS THE SECTION REALLY THAT SORT OF LET YOU DOWN A BIT 
HERE IS YOUR ROSETTE FOR A PASS 
THANK YOU 
BAD NEWS I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
SIXTY THREE 
SIXTY SEVEN WHERE'S THE POINTS GONE 
IN MY EYES SHE SHOULD HAVE GOT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
COS SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
SHE DID EVERYTHING WE ASKED HER TO DO WITH FLYING COLOURS 
I WANNA GET MY GLASSES ON AND COUNT THIS AGAIN 
I'M JUST NOT HAPPY WITH THAT 
I DON'T THINK SHE'S COUNTED IT UP RIGHT I WANNA GET ME CALCULATOR OUT 
DESPITE MIC'S DISAPPOINTMENT ALL THE BORSTAL DOGS HAVE GRADUATED 
THEY'RE FREE TO RETURN HOME 
HAS DILLON STOPPED RIVALLING FOR LINDA'S AFFECTION 
THE DOG'S NOT EVEN BOTHERED NO MORE 
JUST DOES ITS OWN THING 
DILLON LOOKS FORWARD TO SEEING JOHN NOW 
IF SHE TELLS IT TO STAY OFF THE BED IT WILL STAY OFF THE BED 
AND IT DOESN'T GET ON THE BED AT NIGHT TIME 
WE'VE GOT A BLANKET AT THE SIDE AND IT WILL STAY ON THE BLANKET BEDTIME 
THIS IS HOW IT IS NOW ALL THE TIME 
FANTASTIC 
WE CAN HAVE A PROPER RELATIONSHIP WITHOUT THE DOG YEAH 
AND HAS SAFFY FINALLY LEARNED SOME MANNERS 
SHE WAS A SPOILT BRAT WEREN'T YOU BABYCAKES 
DEFINITE CONTEMPT TOWARDS HER BEFORE 
EVERY DAY I'D JUST WORK OUT HOW MUCH HAS TODAY COST ME 
WHAT'S SHE DONE AGAIN NOW IT'S 
NOW I JUST FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT A PET DOG 
WHICH I THINK IS HOW I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE 
AND SHE PLAYS FETCH AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED 
I WANTED A DOG THAT WOULD PLAY FETCH 
SAFFY 
SHE IS THE DOG SHE'S NOT THE LITTLE BABY ANY MORE 
GODDAMN IT DOG BORSTAL TAKEN MY DOGGY AWAY 
PLUS PLUS TEN PLUS FIVE
