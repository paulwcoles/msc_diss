ASKING THE QUESTIONS JEREMY PAXMAN 
HELLO THIS IS THE PENULTIMATE FIRST ROUND MATCH 
AND WITH ONLY FOUR PLACES AVAILABLE IN THE SEMI FINALS 
FOR THE TEAMS WITH THE HIGHEST SCORES 
WE KNOW THAT TO BE IN WITH A CHANCE OF PLAYING AGAIN 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE IS THE MINIMUM AT LEAST ONE OF TONIGHT'S TEAMS MUST REACH 
NOW ONE HAS TO WATCH OUT FOR ENGINEERS WROTE MARCEL PAGNOL 
THEY BEGIN WITH THE SEWING MACHINE AND END UP WITH THE ATOMIC BOMB 
WE HOPE THE TEAM REPRESENTING THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING 
WILL FALL SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO AMBITIONS 
AND TO TEST THEIR METTLE WE MET UP WITH THEM 
AT ONE OF THE U. K.'S MOST STRIKING EXAMPLES OF CONTEMPORARY ENGINEERING 
THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING 
WAS ORIGINALLY FOUNDED AS THE FELLOWSHIP OF ENGINEERING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX 
THE ACADEMY WAS FOUNDED UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH 
HE REMAINS THE SENIOR FELLOW AND ACTIVE IN THE ACADEMY'S AFFAIRS TO THIS DAY 
THE ACADEMY HAS ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FELLOWS 
DRAWN EQUALLY FROM ACADEMIA AND FROM INDUSTRY 
THEY REPRESENT THE LEADING ENGINEERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM 
ELEANOR IS A RESEARCH FELLOW AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON 
HER STRENGTHS ARE PROBABLY IN CLASSICAL MYTHOLOGY ANCIENT HISTORY AND ART 
HER NOT SO STRONG POINTS 
MIGHT BE SOAP OPERAS AND NINETEENTH CENTURY ENGLISH LITERATURE 
JOHN IS A PROFESSOR AT YORK UNIVERSITY 
HIS PARTICULAR STRENGTHS ARE IN NINETEEN SEVENTIES ROCK MUSIC 
HE'S LESS STRONG ON MODERN ART AND HISTORY 
RAYMOND IS A CHEMICAL ENGINEER HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS A SCOT 
WITH THE MIND AND PATIENCE OF A TWENTY YEAR OLD IN A FIFTY YEAR OLD'S BODY 
HAVING SPENT A LIFETIME IN A DIVERSITY OF ENGINEERING ROLES 
I FEEL I'VE PROBABLY ACQUIRED A SMATTERING OF RANDOM KNOWLEDGE 
PERHAPS NOT ALL OF WHICH I'VE FORGOTTEN 
AND ANYWAY BEING NOW LARGELY RETIRED I'VE NOTHING TO LOSE THROUGH IGNORANT GUESSING 
I HOPE THAT IF WE DO WELL 
WE'LL DEMONSTRATE THAT NOT ALL ENGINEERS ARE COMPLETE PHILISTINES 
ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE DO BADLY WELL 
LET'S ASK THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING TEAM TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES 
I'M JOHN MCDERMID FROM YORK WHERE I'M PROFESSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

WE WERE THE FIRST SOCIETY IN THE WORLD 
SPECIFICALLY DEVOTED TO THE LUTE AND ITS MUSIC 
AND SO WE ARE THE LUTE SOCIETY WHEREAS OTHERS IN OTHER COUNTRIES 
HAVE THE LUTE SOCIETY OF AMERICA AND OF FRANCE 
WE ARE THE LUTE SOCIETY THE ORIGINAL AND BEST WE THINK 
PETER WAS ACTUALLY ON UNIVERSITY CHALLENGE IN SEVENTY FIVE SIXTHS 
FOR CHURCHILL COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE 
SO WE'RE HOPING THAT HIS EXPERIENCE OF THAT WILL HELP US THROUGH 
MATTHEW IS A WRITER AS WELL AS A MUSICIAN 
HIS STRENGTHS AND INTERESTS WILL BE CURRENT AFFAIRS 
AND CONTEMPORARY AND ANCIENT CULTURES 
CHRIS IS THE SECRETARY OF THE SOCIETY AND A TERRIFIC ORGANISER 
HIS PARTICULAR STRENGTH WILL BE IN HISTORY AND THE HISTORY OF ART 
I DON'T THINK I WILL DO TERRIBLY WELL 
ON ANYTHING TO DO WITH POP MUSIC OR TELEVISION 
PARTLY BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A TELEVISION AT HOME 
WE ARE ALL BLOKES WITHIN ABOUT A TEN YEAR AGE RANGE 
THROW A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS ABOUT SAY BRIDGET JONES AT US
