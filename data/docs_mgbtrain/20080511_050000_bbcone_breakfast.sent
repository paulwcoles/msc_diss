ABOUT TREATING POLITICS AS A SOAP

MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE INITIAL 
IMPACT OF BURMA'S CYCLONE RELIEF 
WORK REMEMBERS WARNING THEY ARE IN 
A RACE AGAINST TIME TO REPRESENT 
DISEASE AND STARVATION SOME OF THE 
THE AID AGENCIES HAVE HELD A PRESS 
CONFERENCE IN THAILAND THIS MORNING 
ANDREW HARDING JOINS US NOW FROM 
BANGKOK GOOD MORNING ANDREW A 
NUMBER OF THOSE AID AGENCIES 
FRUSTRATED THEY AREN'T FULLY IN 
BURMA DOING THE JOB THAT THEY KNOW 
NEEDS TO BE DONE 
YES IT IS A 
MIXED PICTURE SAVE THE CHILDREN 
GOT THREE MORE VISAS THROUGH THREE 
MORE PEOPLE THEN ALLOWED INTO BURMA 
IT'S HAPHAZARD CLEARLY NOT FAST 
ENOUGH YET 
MEANWHILE OF COURSE 
IN BURMA THIS REFERENDUM WENT AHEAD 
L. MEAN LOTS OF PEOPLE QUESTIONING 
HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE MIDST 
OF A NATIONAL DISASTER TFRPBLT 
DOES SEEM BIZARRE DOPBLT IT THE 
REFERENDUM DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THE 
AREAS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THE 
CYCLONE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
WENT AHEAD THE GENERALS HAVE BEEN 
ON T. V. TRUMPETING A BIG TURNOUT THE 
FACT IS IN BURMA THE MILITARY 
LEADERSHIP IS OP SESED WITH THE 
REFERENDUM IT SEE IT IS AS A WAY TO 
CEMENT AND LA GITMIEZ ITS STRANGLE 
HOLD ON POWER IT IS KEY TO THESE 
OLD MEN IN CHARGE IN THIS COUNTRY 
NOT THE RELIEF OPERATION WHICH OF 
COURSE IS IN SUCH A CRITICAL SHAPE 
MEANWHILE WE HAVE THIS ESTIMATE 
FROM WORLD VISION SAYING UP TO 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED 
STILL VERY HARD PRESUMABLY FOR 
THOSE AID AGENCIES TO ASSESS 
EXACTLY WHAT THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN 
AND THEREFORE WHAT STILL NEEDS TO 
BE DONE 
IT'S A VERY MIXED PICTURE 
WE KNOW THAT SOME AID IS BEGINNING 
TO TRICKLE THROUGH NOW TO RANGOON 
AIRPORT I SPOKE TO AN AGENCY ON 
THE GROUND THIS MORNING IN RANGOON 
THEY WERE SAYING LOOK UN CHR 
FLIGHT GOT IN IT WAS UNLOADED BY 
HAND IT DID GET PUT ON TO TRUCKS 
AND IS GOING OUT TO THE DEALT 
YAFPLT BOATS AS WELL ARE STARTING 
TO GO OUT TO THE DELTA AID IS 
TRICKLING THROUGH IT'S GETTING 
BETTER IT'S STILL WAY SHORT OF 
WHAT IS NEEDED IN THESE CAMP THAT 
IS ARE BEGINNING TO FORM MAKE 
SHIFT CAMPS AROUND THE DISASTER 
ZONE WE ARE SEEING CHILDREN WITH 
DIARRHOEA DEHYDRATED PEOPLE WHO 
GOT WOUNDED DURING THE INITIAL 
CYCLONE THOSE WOUNDS ARE BECOMING 
INFECTED WE HEARD FROM ONE AGENCY 
THAT FAMILIES IN A REMOTE AREA WERE 
GETTING ONE CUP OF RICE PER FAMILY 
PER DAY THAT IS ALL THEY'VE GOT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH PAIRNS WHO 
REFUSE TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN 
VACCINATED SHOULD LOSE THEIR CHILD 
BENEFIT OR NOT BE GIVEN A SCHOOL 
PLACE ACCORDING TO A LEADING PUBLIC 
HEALTH EXPERT AND METROPOLITAN 
POLICE THEY WANT TO PERSUADE MORE 
PARENTS TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN THE 
M. M. R. JAB OPPONENTS SAY IT COULD 
BACK FIRE QUESTIONS OVER THE 
SAFETY OF THE M. M. R. JAB LED TO ONE OF 
THE BIGGEST CONTROVERSYS IN PUBLIC 
HEALTH OVER THE PAST DECADE THE 
GOVERNMENT AND VAST MAJORITY OF 
SCIENTISTS INSIST THE THREE IN ONE 
INJECTION IS SAFE 
BUT FEAR HAS LED TO DROP IN THE IMMUNISATION RATE 
TWO THIRDS OF RESPONDANTS TO OUR 
POLL SAY THEY AGREE THAT GVMENT 
GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO ENSURE HIGH 
LEVELS OF IMMEW NIETIONATION FOR 
VACCINATION TO WORK THAT IS WHY 
THIGHS MEASURES INVOLVING SCHOOLS 
AND CHILD BENEFIT ARE SO ATTRACTIVE 
MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS BELIEVE A 
VACCINATION RATE OF NINETY FIVE PER CENT IS NEEDED 
TO ENSURE ALL CHILDREN ARE 
PROTECTED WITH FIGURES STILL 
HOVERING AROUND EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT SOME FEAR 
THOUSANDS ARE BEING PUT AT RISK 
SAY NOW IS THE TIME FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN CHILDRENS 
CHARITIES ARGUE THAT MANY PARENTS 
ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE INFORMATION 
ON VACCINES PUNISHING THEM THEY 
SAY ISN'T THE ANSWER 
LET US KNOW WITH A YOU THINK ABOUT 
THAT ALL THE WAYS OF GETTING ON 
TOUCH ON THE SCREEN BARACK OBAMA 
HAS BEEN GIVEN A BOOST IN HIS 
CAMPAIGN TO WIN THE DEMOCRATIC 
NOMINATION IN THE U. S. PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTIONS MR. OBAMA PICKED UP 
SUPPORT FROM FOUR MORE SUPER 
DELEGATES AND HE NOW HAS MORE OF 
THEM THAN HILLARY CLINTON IN SUCH 
A CLOSE CONTEST THESE PARTY

NOW IT IS TIME FOR REPORTERS WHICH 
VISITS ZIMBABWE 
ZIMBABWE'S KILLING FIELD JOHN 
SIMPSON INVESTIGATE PRESIDENT 
MUGABE A.'S ROLE PRESIDENT 
MUGABE'S AND GERMANY'S NEW LEFT 
STEVE ROSENBACH REPORTS FROM 
FRANKFURT FRANKFURT WELCOME TO REPORTERS AM TANYA 
BECKETT AS ZIMBABWE AND WAIT TO 
HEAR IF THERE WILL BE RUN OFF 
ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY ROBERT 
MUGABE'S FUTURE IS IN THE BALANCE 
THERE COULD BE CALLED FOR HIM TO BE 
PUT ON TRIAL FOR TIMES THAT 
CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY THE 
EARLIER NINETEEN EIGHTIES SOLDIERS LOYAL TO 
ZIMBABWE WERE ALLEGEDLY ORDERED TO 
KILL HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS JOHN 
SIMPSON WENT BACK TO ZIMBABWE TO 
INVESTIGATE IT 
WE SET OUT AT THREE THIRTY AM AT SO AS TO 
AVOID THE POLICE ROADBLOCKS WITH 
LOCAL HELP WE WERE HEADING DEEP 
INTO MATABELELAND SOUTH FROM 
BULAWAYO WE WENT TO THE SITE OF AN 
OLD CONCENTRATION CAMP DATING BACK 
TO NINETEEN EIGHTY WHEN ROBERT MUGABE WAS 
NEARLY IN POWER MOST OF THE 
BUILDINGS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY 
DESTROYED THIS ONE BROUGHT BACK 
TERRIBLE OF THE RACE FOR THE WOMAN 
WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED US THE LAST 
TIME SHE WAS HERE SHE WAS PRISONER SOME OF 
THERE SHOOT PRISONER SOME THEY'D BEAT UNTIL THEY DIED 
SOME OF THEM THEY WOULD SHOOT IF I 
REMEMBER NOW MY HEART IS SO 
PAINFUL 
THESE ARE THE MEN PAINFUL RESPONSIBLE THE FIFTH BRIGADE OF 
ZIMBABWE PASSED BACK ARMY THEY 
WERE TRAINED BY NORTH KOREANS 
GREATER MR. MUGABE REFERRED TO THE 
MASSACRES AT THE MOMENT OF MADNESS 
LATER 
WERE YOU HAVE OPERATIONS 
YOU A BAND TO HAVE WON A TWO 
UNTOWARD INCIDENT BUT NOT THE MASS 
GRAVES YOU ARE BOUND TO HAVE 
WARNED HER TWO WENT TO WORD 
INCIDENTS 
THIS MAN EXPLAINED THAT THEY HAD 
BEEN ORDERED TO KILL ROBERT BUT 
ABBOTT CAUSED BY POLITICAL ANIMALS 
ENEMIES ROBERT MUGABE A.'S 
POLITICAL ANIMALS THE BODIES WERE 
THROWN DOWN A NEARBY MINESHAFT WE 
HEADED OFF THERE YOU CAN JUST SEE 
THE BUILDINGS ON THE SITE OF THE 
ROAD SIGHED WE HAVE TO BE 
CAREFUL HERE BECAUSE THIS ENTIRE 
AREA IS CONTROLLED BY A MILITIA 
LOYAL TO ROBERT BUT LOVELY GETTING 
THERE WAS TENSE BUSINESS AT THE 
MINEHEAD WE LOWERED OUR CAMERA DOWN 
THE SHAFT OF DOWN THE SHAFT TO 
SEE IF THE BONES WERE YOU AT THE 
BOTTOM BUT THEY HAD BEEN RIBERY IN 
THE BUSH CLOSE BY FEW YEARS AGO 
IN ORDER TO HIDE THE TRACES OF 
MASSACRE AN OLD MAN HAD WATCHED AS 
THE NEW GRAVES FOR DOG AND HE 
SHOWED US WHAT THEY WERE ACCORDING 
TO CATHOLIC COMMISSION WHICH 
INVESTIGATED THE MASSACRES IN 
MATABELELAND AT LEAST TWENTY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE DIED TOGETHER BACK IN 
BULAWAYO WE WENT TO SEE THE FORMER 
CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP WHO HAD 
COURAGEOUSLY PROTEST ABOUT THE 
KILLINGS D. HE THINK THAT ROBERT 
MUGABE WAS RESPONSIBLE 
I BELIEVE BECAUSE WHO CAN GIVE 
ORDERS MUGABE SAID THE SOLDIERS TO 
KILL I BELIEVE THAT SMACKS CENT 
MATABELELAND WAS THE ZIMBABWE'S 
KILLING FIELDS BUT WILL ANYBODY BE 
BROUGHT TO TRIAL FOR WHAT HAPPENED 
HERE NOT NECESSARILY THE MAIN 
REASON WHY ROBERT MUGABE AND HIS 
ASSOCIATES CLUNG TO POWER HAS BEEN 
THEIR FEAR THAT THEY WOULD SPEND 
THE REST OF THEIR DAYS IN PRISON 
MAYBE A NEW GOVERNMENT MIGHT THINK 
IT WAS BETTER TO MEND A BROKEN 
SOCIETY BY FORGIVING ROVER WHAT 
ABBEY RATHER THAN BY PUNCHING HIM 
ROBERT MUGABE THERE IS A MAJOR 
SHIFT TAKING PLACE IN GERMAN 
POLITICS WHICH IS COSTING WAS IN 
MANY TO SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE THE 
LEFT IS BECOMING A GROWING FORCE 
DUE TO A CRUSADE AGAINST SOCIAL 
INJUSTICE THERE IS INCREASING 
CONCERN ACROSS GERMANY AT THE 
DIFFERENCE IN RICH AND POOR 
GERMANY'S POLITICAL LANDSCAPE HAS 
CHANGED VERY LITTLE AND THE LAST TWENTY 
YEARS FOUR PARTIES FOUR CHORUS 
HAVE MADE OF THE PICTURE THE 
SOCIAL DEMOCRATS THE CHRISTIAN EL 
PRAT THE LIVE ROADS AND THE GREENS 
IN DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS THROUGH 
DIFFERENT COALITIONS THESE ARE THE 
PARTIES WHICH HAVE SHARED THE 
CANVAS SOMETHING IS CHANGING AT 
FIFTH FORDS HAS EMERGED IT IS 
REDRAWING THE LANDSCAPE FIFTH 
FORCE THEY CALL THEMSELVES THE 
LEFT THEY FIGHT SOCIAL INJUSTICE 
AND HAVE BEEN DUBBED THE ROBBEN 
HOOD OF GERMAN POLITICS 
LET US GET MORE MONEY FROM THE 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SO MUCH MORE MONEY 
AND AT SPEND SOME OF THIS MONEY 
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING VERY 
HARD EACH DAY BUT THEY END UP ABLE 
TO LIVE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO 
LIVE LIVE THOSE HARDEST HIT BY ON EMPLOYMENT

WESTERN GERMANY THIS IS FRANKFURT 
GERMANY'S BRASH AND BOOMING 
FINANCIAL CAPITAL MAKING MONEY IS 
WELL THIS CITY IS ALL ABOUT 
FRANKFURT IS IN ONE OF GERMANY'S 
MOST PROSPEROUS STATE BUT EVEN 
HERE IN THE BEATING HEART OF GERMAN 
CAPITALISM THE LEFT IS GAINING 
GROUND RECENT ELECTIONS THE LEFT 
WON SEAT IN THE LOCAL PARLIAMENT 
ELECTORAL SUCCESS REPEATED IN OTHER 
GERMAN STATES ACCORDING TO OPINION 
POLLS THE LEFT IS THAT THE MOST 
POPULAR OPPOSITION PARTY IN GERMANY 
THIS WOMAN VOTED FOR THE LEFT A 
TRAINED PSYCHOLOGIST SHE HAS BEEN 
UNEMPLOYED FOR TEN YEARS SHE HAS 
LOST FAITH IN THE OLD PARTIES 
WELFARE REFORMS UNDER THE PREVIOUS 
GOVERNMENT SLASH TO UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT 
TODAY SUMS HER SIMPLE AND SHOCKING 
HER SUMS URN MACRO SIMPLE AS THE 
THERE IS MASSIVE SOCIAL INJUSTICE 
IN GERMANY 
THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR IS 
WIDENING THERE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
GETTING RICHER POVERTY IS 
INCREASING TOO SOME PEOPLE FEEL 
HUMILIATED I JUST FEEL ANGRY 
SWIRLING RANS GERMANY'S TOP 
COMPANIES BY IMAGES AND BY 
REPORTS OF HEFTY PAY RISES IT ALL 
ADDS TO THE GENERAL PICTURE OF 
SOCIAL INJUSTICE THE GERMAN 
ECONOMY HAS BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL 
IN RECENT YEARS ON EMPLOYMENT HAS 
BEEN FALLING BUT THE GAP BETWEEN 
RICH AND POOR HERE HAS BEEN GROWING 
TO MANY GERMANS FEEL ANGRY AND 
WITH A DEEP SENSE OF INJUSTICE IT 
IS THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING THAT 
EXPLAINS THE RISE OF THE LEFT NOT 
EVERYONE IS SO PESSIMISTIC THIS 
MAN IS GERMANY'S ENTREPRENEUR OF 
THE YEAR HIS FRANKFURT BASED 
TRADING COMPANY HAS GROWN QUICKLY 
HE DOES NOT BELIEVE GERMAN MEET 
ROBIN HOOD TO REDISTRIBUTE THE 
WEALTH 
YOU HAVE POOR PEOPLE AND RICH 
PEOPLE IN EVERY COUNTRY WOULD I 
DESCRIBE IT AS EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH 
IN GERMANY NO WOULD NOT THIS 
SITUATION IS ALREADY MUCH BETTER 
THAN IT WAS FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS 
AGO AGO BY BUT IT IS GLOOM NOT BOOM AT

ARE FAVOURITES TO LIFT THE PROFI A 
REPLICA AT STAMFORD BRIDGE IN CASE 
CHELSEA SNATCH THE TITLE CLEVER 
CHAPS 
IT IS THE CLOSEST TITLE RACE CHAPS IN FORTY YEARS BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST 
TIME SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THE TOP TWO TEAMS 
IN THE TOP DEVISION IN ENGLAND GO 
INTO THEIR FINAL GAMES LEVEL ON 
POINTS THE MATHS AT LEAST ARE 
SIMPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR VASTLY 
SUPERIOR GOAL DIFFERENCE 
MANCHESTER UNITED WILL RETAIN THEIR 
PREMIER LEAGUE TIET PHYSICAL THEY 
WIN 
WIN AT WIGAN IF THEY DRAW CHELSEA 
WOULD BE CHAMPIONS IF THEY BEAT 
BOLTON AT STAMFORD BRIDGE IF THEY 
MATCH EACH OTHER'S RESULT IT WILL

THIS AT HOME THEY PLAYED 
FANTASTIC AGAINST US THEY KNOW 
THEY ARE IN THE SPOTLIGHT ALL OVER 
THE WORLD NOW EVERYBODY IS 
WATCHING I THINK THEY WILL DO 
THEIR BEST FROM AN ERA WHEN 
MANCHESTER UNITED WERE CHAMPIONS OF 
EUROPE AND ENGLAND TEDDY EXPECTS 
TENSION 
WIGAN ARE SHOWING A GOOD TENSION BIT OF FORM RECENTLY IT WILL BE A 
TOUGH GAME FOR MANCHESTER UNITED TO 
WIN YOU HAVE TO WIN THE GAME YOU 
HAVE TO GET THE GOAL YOU HAVE TO 
GET THE BALL IN THE BACK OF THE NET 
EARLY TO RELAX IF IT GOES TO FORTY FIVE 
FIFTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE MINUTES AND YOU ARE ZERO TO ZERO IT 
COULD BE VERY DODGY MOMENTS LAST LAST WEEKEND UNITED WON AT A STROLL AND 
THE SAME THING COULD HAPPEN TODAY 
AVRAM GRANT WILL BE PROUD OF HIS 
TEAM IF THEY FINISH SECOND L. 
WONDER IF THE SAME THING WOULD BE 
TRUE OF THIS MANAGER 
THREE TEAMS ARE INVOLVED IN THE 
LAST DAY 
TO AVOID 
RELEGATION 
ONLY ONE TEAM CAN SURVIVE OUT OF 
THE THREE BIRMINGHAM START THE DAY 
SECOND FROM BOTTOM A POINT BEHIND 
READING AND FULHAM PLAY THEIR LAST 
MATCH AT HOME TO BLACKBURN READING 
ARE RELEGATED DERBY THEY HAVEN'T 
SCORED A GOAL IN THE LAST SIX 
MATCHES FULHAM MUST HOPE 
PORTSMOUTH HAVE THEIR MINDS ON THE 
F. A. CUP FINAL 
F. A. CUP FINAL

COMPLAIN AGAINST MIKE MCCURRY 
FOLLOWING YESTERDAY'S S. P. L. GAME AT 
RANGERS HE TURNED DOWN A STRONG 
CLAIM BY UNITED FOR A PENALTY AND 
DISALLOWED A GOAL AS WELL RANGERS 
WON THREE TO ONE TO MOVE WITHIN A POINT OF 
CELTIC AND THEY HAVE A GAME IN HAND 
SIX GAMES IN TWO WEEKS WILL 
DETERMINE WHETHER RANGERS END THE 
SEASON WITH FOUR TROPHIES THEY ARE 
START AGAINST DUNDEE YUEPBLD 
SUGGEST THAT IS IS A POSSIBILITY 
THEY SCORED TWICE IN THE FIRST EIGHTEEN 
MINUTES UNITED WERE DENIED A 
PENALTY THEN HAD A GOAL DISALLOWED 
FOR OFFSIDE EVEN THOUGH THE SHOT

FISH TO FRY HE HAS TO DIFFUSE THE 
TEN P. TAX ROW THE BY ELECTION IN

JOHN PRESCOTT'S MOTIVATION BE IN 
WRITING SO CANDIDLY ABOUT THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP ABOUT THE CURRENT 
PRIME MINISTER'S PERSONALITY L. 
MEAN YOU COULD SAY HE JUST WANTS

PUBLISHED PROPOSALS FOR RADICAL 
ACTION 
TWO THIRDS OF RESPOND TOONTS OUR

SO ATTRACTIVE MEDICAL 
PROFESSIONALS BELIEVE A VACCINATION 
OF RATE OF NINETY FIVE PER CENT IS NEEDED TO ENSURE

TALKING ABOUT A GENERATION OF 
CHILDREN WHO COULD BE WIPED FOUT 
HELP DOESN'T GET THERE QUICKLY 
OXFAM HAVE HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE 
IN WHICH THEY SAY THE INITIAL DEATH 
TOLL WAS PROBABLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THEY SAY 
IF HELP DOESN'T GET THERE QUICKLY 
THAT NUMBER COULD RISE UP TO FIFTEEN 
TIMES MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE 
POTENTIALLY COULD BE IN DANGER IN 
BURMA YOU CAN SEE THE STORY THERE 
JOHN PRESCOTT HE HAS HIS 
SERIALISATION OF HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
COMING OUT MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE 
ROWS BETWEEN GORDON AND TONY BLAIR 
THE SUNDAY EXPRESS THIS MORNING HAS 
THIS STORY THAT CHILDREN COULD BE 
BARRED FROM TAKING UP THEIR SCHOOL 
PLACE UNLESS THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN 
ALL THEIR VACCINATIONS 
CONTROVERSIAL 
PROPOSED 
CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSALS PROPOSED BY THE FABIAN SOCIETY ONE 
SUGGESTION TO GET KIDS TO HAVE THE 
JABS 
ENGLAND'S IDGEAGING POPULATION 
MEANS IN TWENTY YEARS TIME THERE MAY 
NOT BE ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND SOCIAL 
CARE FOR DISABLED AND ERLDLY PEOPLE 
THE GOVERNMENT IS ESTIMATING THE 
EXTRA AMOUNT NEEDED TO PLUG THIS 
GAP IS SIX BILLION WHERE SHOULD THE 
FINANCE COME FROM AND HOW SHOULD IT 
BE SPENT STEPHEN BURKE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OF THE CHARITY COUNSEL 
AND CARE IS HERE ALONG WITH NADRA 
AHMED CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL CARE 
ASSOCIATION HELP US FIRST OF ALL 
WITH THESE ENORMOUS FIGURES THIS 
SIX BILLION FIGURE WHAT DOES THAT 
REPRESENT 
WELL AT THE MOMENT A REPRESENT LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO GET 
THE CARE THAT THEY NEED TODAY AND 
AS YOUR INTRODUCTION SAID THE 
POPULATION IS AGEING WE ARE LIVING 
LONGER THE DEMAND FOR CARE AND 
SUPPORT WILL INCREASE OVER THE NEXT 
TWENTY YEARS THE ESTIMATES OF THE 
UNDERFUNDING VARY FROM SIX BILLION 
TO AS MUCH AS TWENTY BILLION WE FACE 
A BIG SHORTFALL HERE A BIG GAP FOR 
THE FUTURE THE QUESTION IS HOW DO 
WE FUND THAT DOES THAT COME FROM 
THE STATE DOES COME FROM 
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IS THERE 
ANOTHER WAY COLLECTIVELY OF MAKING 
UP THE GAP 
AS FAR AS PEOPLE MOST 
PEOPLE ARE AWARE THERE IS SOME 
SOCIAL CARE AVAILABLE BUT IT TENDS 
TO BE MEANS TESTED AND A LOT OF 
PEOPLE FEEL FRUSTRATED THAT THEY 
CAN'T GET THE SOCIAL CARE THAT THEY 
FEEL THAT THEY NEED DOES THAT 
ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THE SITUATION 
AT THE MOMENT 
YES IT DOES IT HAS 
GOT PROGRESSIVELY WORK AS WORSE 
AS TIME AS GONE ON AS THE INCREASE 
FOR DEMAND TAKES EFFECT THE MEANS 
TESTING GETS HARDER THE ASSESSMENT 
DONE OF PEOPLE OF PEOPLE WHO CAN 
ACCESS THE SERVICE BECOMES MORE 
DIFFICULTY BECAUSE OF THE FUNDING 
ISSUES OF COURSE IN AMONGST THAT 
IS ALSO THE QUALITY ISSUE BECAUSE 
OF THE SERVICE WE ARE PROVIDING A 
MUCH MORE PERSONALISED SERVICE NOW 
THAN BEFORE WE ARE TAKING A LOT 
MORE NOTICE OF THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE 
WHICH ARE MUCH MORE ACUTE THAN THEY 
WERE THE BALANCE HAS SHIFTED THE 
SOCIAL CARE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE NOW 
LOOKING AFTER ARE VERY MUCH THOSE 
THAT WERE IN LONG STAGE INJURY AT 
RICK AWARD THERE IS MUCH MORE 
INTERVENTION THAN WAS IN THE OLD 
DAYS 
I WONDER WHETHER THESE DAYS PROPOSALS SEEM OR THIS SUGGESTION 
THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT A 
RADICAL RETHINK SEEM TO BE 
SOFTENING US UP TO SUGGEST THAT WE 
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY MORE THAT 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THINK ABOUT 
TAKING MORE INDIVIDUAL 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR SOCIAL CARE 
I THINK PEOPLE'S FPGS EXPECTATIONS 
ARE INCREASING PEOPLE WANT BETTER 
SERVICES AND BETTER QUALITY CARE 
THEY WANT MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR 
CARE THEY WANT TO LIVE 
INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR OWN HOME IF 
THEY HAVE TO MOVE INTO HOME THEY 
WANT BETTER CARE THERE HOW DO WE 
DELIVER THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS 
THIS DEBATE IT TO GO ON OVER THE 
NEXT FEW MONTHS TO LOOK AT 
DIFFERENT WAYS OF PAYING FOR CARE 
THE BALANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY 
BETWEEN THE FAMILY AND STATE WEFPLT 
NEED TO BE CREATIVE IN HOW WE DO 
THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE 
CURRENT SPEND HOW CAN WE SPEND 
THAT BETTER WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE 
SERVICES THAT OLDER PEOPLE USE NOT 
JUST CARE SERVICES WE ALSO NEED TO 
LOOK CREATIVELY AT THINGS LIKE 
SOCIAL INSURANCE WHICH OTHER 
COUNTRIES USE WE NEED TO LEARN 
FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD WHERE 
THEY ARE FACING THE SAME PROBLEMS 
THE SAME ISSUES OF AN AGEING 
POPULATION 
WHAT IS THE WORST SEE POPULATION NOR YEO TWENTY YEARS TIME PEOPLE IN 
POST SIXTY FIVE THEY HAVE CARE NEEDS FOR 
THEM WHAT IS THE WORSE POSSIBLE 
SCENARIO 
FOR US WE FEEL QUITE WE SCENARIO WANT TO BE POSITIVE ABOUT YOU KNOW 
HOW THE SERVICE CAN BE PROVIDED 
THE BIGGEST ISSUE WE REALLY HAVE IS 
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO FIND THE 
WORKFORCE TO DELIVER IT AS WE HAVE 
AN AGEING POPULATION WE HAVE LESS 
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE IN THAT 
WORKFORCE THAT IS AN ISSUE AS TO 
HOW WE ARE GOING TO BRING THE 
WORKFORCE IN TRAIN THEM AND MAKE 
SURE THAT THEY ARE DELIVERING THE 
QUALITY OF THE SERVICE THAT WE ARE 
ALL ASPIRING TO THE WORSE CASE SEE 
N. R. YEO THERE WILL BE ISSUES AROUND 
FUNDING AS HE WITH RAISE THE 
PROFILE AND IMAGE OF SOCIAL CARE 
AND TRAIN THE STAFF TO DELIVER 
BETTER QUALITY SERVICE WE NEED TO 
BE PAYING THEM BETTER 
IN A 
HOUSEHOLD YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ON 
THE ONE HAND CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY 
FOR THE CARE ON THE OTHER HAND ARE 
BEING TOLD THERE IS NO CARE 
AVAILABLE THROUGH THE STATE YES YES WELL THEY ARE BEING MEANS TESTED 
MUCH MORE THAN THEY WERE PUTTING 
IT POLITELY I GUESS IS THAT WE 
ARE MOVING TOWARDS THE MOST ACUTE 
SERVICE AVAILABLE SO YOU KNOW 
YEARS AGO WHAT USED TO HAPPEN WAS 
WE USED TO CATCH PEOPLE BEFORE THEY 
REALLY NEEDED A LOT OF CARE SO WE 
WOULD HELP THEM WITH DOMESTIC 
SERVICES AND ALL THAT KIND IT'S 
SUPPORTED THEM FOR A LONGER PERIOD 
OF TIME NOW WE ARE WAITING FOR THE 
BREAK DOWN AND THEN GOING IN IT'S 
MUCH MORE ACUTE SERVICE THAT WE ARE 
PROVIDING SO THAT IS GOING TO BE 
MORE EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW OUR HOPE 
IS THAT THIS CONSULTATION WILL TAKE 
ON BOARD EVERYTHING THERE HAVE 
BEEN A LOT OF INDEPENDENT REVIEWS 
OUT THERE ABOUT THIS WE NEED TO 
PUT THE WHOLE THING IN THE MIX AND 
GET IT TOGETHER WHERE THERE IS A 
WILL THERE IS A WAY THERE WILL BE 
PAIN WITH THE PAIN THERE WILL BE 
GAIN WE NEED TO BE TALKING AND 
LISTENING 
THERE ARE MORE OF US GETTING OLDER 
THERE ARE FEW OF US TO LOOK AFTER 
THOSE PEOPLE AND THERE IS LESS 
MONEY IN THE POT DO WE FACE 
SITUATION WHERE THERE IS GOING TO 
BE AN EMERGENCY SITUATION AS WE ARE 
GIVEN THIS CARE CHANGE IS ALREADY 
HAPPENING LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE 
MAKING CARE MUCH MORE PERSONAL TO 
THE INDIVIDUAL THAT IS THE FIRST 
STEP THE SECOND ONE IS 
ACKNOWLEDGING THE SCALE OF THE 
PROBLEM ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WAS 
LOOKING AT HOW WE SUPPORT OR UNPAID 
CARERS THOSE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY 
WHO LOOK AFTER OLDER PEOPLE THE 
OTHER KEY THING IS HOW WE BRING 
EXTRA FUNDS INTO THE CARE SYSTEM 
WE'RE GOING TO NEED MORE MONEY IN 
THE FUTURE DO WE NEED TO PAY MORE 
FOR TAX AS TAXES NEED A 
SIMPLER FAIRER AND MORE CONSISTENT 
TRANSPARENCY I AM SURE PEOPLE HAVE 
USED A MISS OXFAM HAS WARNED THIS 
MORNING THAT THE LIVES OF UP TO FIFTEEN 
MILLION VICTIMS OF THE BURMESE 
CYCLONE COULD BE IN DANGER FROM 
DISEASE IF CLEAN WATER AND 
SANITATION ARE NOT PROVIDED SOON

INDICATION AT ALL THAT THE BRUMMIES 
AUTHORITY THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES 
IS RELAXING IN TERMS OF WHO THEY 
WILL ALLOW INTO THE COUNTRY

CHANCE SOME OF THE SMALLER 
AGENCIES ARE BEGINNING TO SOUND 
MORE OPTIMISTIC SAVE THE CHILDREN 
WERE TELLING ME THEY HAVE MANAGED 
TO OFFLOAD A BIG PLANE LOAD OF UN 
EQUIPMENT AT THE AIRPORT THEY WERE 
ALLOWED TO TAKE THAT VERY QUICKLY

THE BIG ORGANISATIONS THE PEOPLE 
WHO COULD BRING IN HUGE QUANTITIES 
OF AID ARE HAVING ENORMOUS 
LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS THE BURMESE 
ARE STICKING TO THIS POSITION VERY 
CLEARLY THAT YOU CAN BRING URINE IN

CENTRE OF THE SAILING WORLD 
PLYMOUTH'S HISTORIC BARBICAN

PREPARATION OF THAT BOAT THREE 
THINGS THE BOAT THE WEATHER AND 
THE SKIPPER

INVOLVED THE COMPETITION HAS NEVER 
BEEN SO FIERCE WITH FINAL 
PREPARATIONS UNDER WAY ANY 
ADVANTAGE COUNTS 
SOME EVEN USE SKUEBER DIVERS TO 
CLEAN THE HULL OF THEIR BOATS FOR 
SPEED 
IT MAKES THE BOAT LOOK SPEED BETTER 
THIS WAS THE EVENT THAT STARTED THE 
WHOLE NOTION OF SINGLE HANDED 
SAILING IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIR FRANCES 
CHICHESTER WON THE RACE HALF A

WASHING DRESSING EATING STATE 
SUPPORT IS MEANS TESTED MOST 
PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT FOR 
THEMSELVES THAT CAN COME AS QUITE 
A SHOCK MINISTERS SAY IT'S TIME 
FOR A RADICAL RE THINK TOMORROW 
THEY WILL LAUNCH A PUBLIC 
CONSULTATION ASKING HOW THE STATE 
FAMILIES AND TEACHES SHOULD SHARE 
THE COST OF THIS INCREASINGLY 
IMPORTANT SERVICE 
THE DEBATE NEEDS 
TO BE HONEST AND MATURE AND NEEDS 
TO BE REAL IT NEEDS TO BE HOW DO 
WE GET A SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE DESERVE 
BUT EQUALLY WHAT DO WE THINK IS 
FAIR AND REALISTIC IN TERMS OF WHAT 
WE ASK THE GOVERNMENT AND WHAT WE 
ASK OF FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS 
ONE OPTION CERTAIN TO BE RULED OUT 
IS MAKING SOCIAL CARE FREE IT 
HAPPENS IN SCOTLAND BUT PROVED SO 
COSTLY THERE HAS BEEN RATIONING AND 
NOW LARGE CASH INJECTIONS IN 
ENGLAND MINISTERS SAY PEOPLE LIKE 
PAUL AND GLADYS DESERVE BETTER 
DEAL HOW TO ACHIEVE THAT IS A 
MASSIVE CHALLENGE 
A TEENAGER WHO CELEBRATED HIS SIXTEENTH 
BIRTHDAY ON FRIDAY WAS MURDERED 
YESTERDAY IN A BAKER'S SHOP 
PRAYERS WILL BE SAID FOR JIMMY 
MIZZEN AT HIS LOCAL CHURCH TODAY 
KEITH BREEN IS THERE 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JIMMY MIZZEN WAS AN 
ALTER BOY HERE AT HIS LOCAL CHURCH

YESTERDAY MORNING NOW EVERY 
SUNDAY MORNING HE WOULD COME TO 
THIS CHURCH AND HELP THE PRIEST 
GIVE OUT COMMUNION THIS MORNING 
HIS PARENTS WILL JOIN THE 
CONGREGATION TWO DAYS AFTER HIS 
SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY TO OFFER PRAYERS OF 
REMEMBRANCE IT'S THOUGHT THAT 
JIMMY MIZZEN HAD GONE TO THE SHOPS 
WITH ONE OF HIS BROTHERS TO BUY HIS 
FIRST LOTTERY TICKET WITNESSES SAY 
THE PAIR WERE INSIDE THE THREE 
COOKS BAKERY YESTERDAY MORNING WHEN 
A MAN BEGAN ATTACKING STAFF 
I SEE HIM WITH A SIGN SMASHING A 
SHOP DOOR KICKING IT THROUGH HE 
HAS FORCED HIMSELF INTO THE SHOP 
FROM WHAT I COULD SEE HE WAS 
HITTING SOMEBODY WITH THE SIGN 
THESE PICTURES TAKEN INSIDE THE 
BAKERY GIVE GLIMPSE OF THE 
STRUGGLE THAT TOOK PLACE HERE 
JIMMY WAS LEFT WITH SERIOUS NECK 
INJURIES AND DIED AT THE SCENE 
FRIENDS HAVE BEEN PAYING TRIBUTE 
HE WAS SUCH A LOVELY PERSON 
WALKING TO SCHOOL SEEING HIM AT 
SCHOOL PLAYING GAMES ALL OF THOSE 
PRIMARY SCHOOL GAMES CHILDHOOD 
MEMORIES I WILL NEVER FORGET ALL I 
CAN SAY I HOPE HIS FAMILY I KNOW 
HIS FAMILY WELL MARGARET AND BARRY 
I HOPE THEY STAY STRONG ALL MY 
PRAYERS AND THOUGHTS ARE WITH THEM 
POLICE SAY JIMMY MAY HAVE KNOWN HIS 
ATTACKER BUT THEY DON'T THINK HIS 
DEATH WAS GANG RELATED THE SIX 
FOOT TEENAGER HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY 
HIS MOTHER AS A GENTLE GIANT LOVED 
BY HIS FAMILY AND ALL THOSE WHO 
KNEW HIM AT SCHOOL AND CHURCH 
WE EXPECT HIS PARENTS AS I SAY TO 
COME ALONG TO THE MASS AT NINE HUNDRED A M. 
THIS MORNING AT OUR LADY OF LOURDES 
CHURCH HERE THEIR SON WAS DUE TO 
SIT HIS GCSES EXAMINATIONS IN A FEW 
WEEKS' TIME HE HAS BECOME THE THIRTEENTH 
TEENAGER TO BE MURDERED IN LONDON 
THIS YEAR 
THE FORMER DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER 
JOHN PRESCOTT HAS SAID HE URGED 
TONY BLAIR TO SACK GORDON BROWN 
BUT THAT TONY BLAIR WAS SCARED OF 
HIS CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER 
OXFAM HAS WARNED THIS MORNING THAT LIVES OF FIFTEEN MILLION VICTIMS OF THE 
BURMESE CYCLONE COULD BE IN DANGER 
OF DISEASE IF SANITATION AND CLEAN 
WATER IS NOT PROVIDED SOON 
LET'S SPEAK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT 
LYSE DOUCET WHO IS IN THE REGION 
FOR US THIS MORNING 
THIS IS A DEVASTATING PREDICTION BY 
OXFAM 
INDEED JUST TAKE A LOOK OXFAM BEHIND ME I'M RIGHT ON THE THAI 
BURMA BORDER IT'S CALLED THE THAI 
BURMA FRIENDSHIP BRIDGE IT'S A 
CROSSING WHERE AID AGENCIES COULD 
SEND IN AID AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
THERE IS AN AIRFIELD IN THIS REGION 
WHERE POTENTIALLY BIG DONORS HAVE 
BEEN ASSESSING WHETHER IT COULD BE 
USED BUT ONLY TWO TRUCKS HAVE GONE 
OVER IN THE PAST WEEK FROM THE 
UNITED NATIONS THERE ARE REPORTS 
THAT EVEN WHEN THAT CROSSED OVER 
INTO BURMA THEY WERE SEIZED BY THE 
BURMESE AUTHORITIES WE ARE GETTING 
DIRE PREDICTIONS THESE ARE VERY 
SKILLED PEOPLE THEY'VE WORKED IN A 
LOT OF DISASTERS IN THIS AREA THEY 
POINT OUT IN THE MASSIVE TSUNAMI OF 
LATE TWO THOUSAND FOUR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED 
ACROSS THIS REGION ON THE VERY 
FIRST DAY THERE WERE NO SUBSEQUENT 
OUTBREAKS OF DISEASES NO MORE 
DEATHS BECAUSE A MASSIVE AID 
OPERATION WAS MOBILISED RIGHT 
AROUND THE WORLD THERE THANK IS 
NOT HAPPENING YET IN BURMA THERE 
IS A GROWING CONCERN THAT IT WON'T 
HAPPEN AND THERE WILL BE THIS 
SECOND MANMADE DISASTER MORE 
DEATHS BECAUSE OF NEGLECT 
THERE MUST BE THERE WHERE YOU ARE 
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF FRUSTRATION 
AND EVEN GROWING ANGER AMONGST THE 
AID AGENCIES DO THEY HAVE IDEAS OF 
HOW PRESSURE CAN BE PUT ON THE 
BURMESE AUTHORITIES FROM THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO GET THIS 
AID THROUGH 
WELL IT'S FRUSTRATING EVERY TIME 
I HAVE SPOKEN TO AID WORKERS THEY 
TALK ABOUT THEIR FRUSTRATION 
THEY'RE ALARMED AND SHOCKED AND 
TALK ABOUT IT AS BEING 
UNPRECEDENTED THEY SAY THAT BURMA 
IS DIFFERENT IT IS A DIFFERENT 
COUNTRY FROM A LOT OF THE OTHERS 
LIKE BANGLADESH OR INDONESIA WHO 
HAVE CONFRONTED THIS KIND OF A 
DISASTER BEFORE BECAUSE THE 
BURMESE GENERALS ARE WORRIED MOST 
OF ALL ABOUT THE SURVIVAL OF THEIR 
REGIME THEY DON'T WANT FOREIGNERS 
RUNNING AROUND THE COUNTRY SAVING 
BURMESE PEOPLE FROM THIS NATURAL 
DISASTER WE'VE EVEN HAD REPORTS 
FROM INDEEDSIDE BURMA THAT SOME OF 
THE AID BOXES DONATED FROM OUTSIDE 
HAVE BEEN SCRIBBLED ON THEM WITH 
THE NAME OF ONE GENERAL OR ANOTHER 
PRETENDING THAT IT IS THE BURMESE 
MILITARY THEMSELVES WHO ARE BEING 
SO GENERATION WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE 
IN SUCH DESPERATE NEED 
LYSE DOUCET 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
PARENTS WHO REFUSE TO HAVE THEIR 
CHILDREN VACCINATED SHOULD LOSE 
THEIR CHILD BENEFIT OR NOT BE GIVEN 
A SCHOOL PLACE ACCORDING TO A 
LABOUR M. P. AND A LEADING PUBLIC 
HEALTH EXPERT THEY WANT TO 
PERSUADE MORE PARENTS TO GIVE THEIR 
CHILDREN THE M. M. R. JAB OPPONENTS SAY 
THE PROPOSALS ARE DRACONIAN AND 
COULD BACK FIRE 
QUESTIONS OVER THE SAFETY OF THE 
M. M. R. JAB LED TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
CONTROVERSIES IN PUBLIC HEALTH OVER 
THE PAST DECADE THE GOVERNMENT AND 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCIENTISTS 
INSIST THAT THE THREE IN ONE 
INJECTION IS SAFE BUT FEAR AMONG 
SOME PARENTS HAS LED TO A DROP IN 
IMMUNISATION RATE THE FABIAN 
SOCIETY HAS PUBLISHED NEW PROPOSALS 
TO PREVENT CHILDREN STARTING SCHOOL 
UNLESS THEY HAVE PROOF OF 
VACCINATION AND SECONDLY TO 
WITHDRAW CHILD BENEFITS IF PARENTS 
FAIL TO GET THEIR CHILDREN 
IMMUNISED 
TWO THIRDS OF IMMUNISED RESPONDENTS TO OUR POLL SAY THEY 
AGREE THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO 
ENSURE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF 
IMMUNISATION OF VACCINATION TO WORK 
THIS IS WHY THESE MEASURES 
INVOLVING SCHOOLS AND CHILD BENEFIT 
WHICH HAVE AN ELEMENT OF 
UNIVERSITYTY ARE SO ATTRACTIVE 
MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS BELIEVE A 
VACCINATION RATE OF NINETY FIVE PER CENT IS NEEDED 
TO ENSURE ALL CHILDREN ARE 
PROTECTED WITH FIGURES STILL 
HOVERING AROUND EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT SOME FEAR 
THOUSANDS ARE BEING PUT AT RISK 
THEY SAY NOW IS THE TIME FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN CHILDREN'S 
CHARITIES ARGUE THAT MANY PARENTS 
ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE INFORMATION 
ON VACCINES PUNISHING THEM THEY 
SAY IS NOT THE ANSWER 
BARACK OBAMA HAS BEEN GIVE AN BOOST 
IN HIS CAMPAIGN TO WIN THE DEMOCRAT 
NOMINATION IN THE U. S. PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTIONS MR. OBAMA PICKED UP 
SUPPORT FROM FOUR MORE 
SUPERDELEGATES HE NOW HAS MORE OF 
THOSE THAN HILLARY CLINTON IN SUCH 
A CLOSE CONTEST THESE PARTY 
OFFICIALS ARE CRUCIAL BECAUSE THEY 
CAN VOTE FOR WHICHEVER CANDIDATE 
THEY LIKE REGARDLESS OF THE RESULTS 
IN THE PRIMARIES THE NEW MAYOR OF 
LONDON BORIS JOHNSON HAS BEEN 
CAUGHT BREAKING THE HIGHWAY CODE 
WHILE CYCLING FOOTAGE SHOT BY THE 
SUNDAY MIRROR SHOWS BORIS JUMPING 
THE RELIGHTS AND MOUNTING PAVEMENT PAVEMENT LET'S LOOK AT OUR TOP STORIES 
HEALTH SCARES ABOUT CHILDHOOD 
IMMUNISATIONS HAVE LED TO MANY 
PARENTS BOYCOTTING THE JABS SOME 
HEALTH EXPERTS ARGUE THEY SHOULD BE 
PENALISED A LABOUR M. P. AND A PUBLIC 
HEALTH EXPERT HAVE PROPOSED PARENTS 
COULD BE REFUSED SCHOOL PLACE OR 
CHILD BENEFIT PAYMENTS IF THEY 
REFUSE THE M. M. R. MICHELLE ELLIOT IS 
FROM KIDSCAPE IS A GOOD IDEA TO 
ENCOURAGE UPTAKE 
I DON'T THINK 
THIS ENCOURAGES UPTAKE THIS IS 
SAYING TO PARENTS WE KNOW BEST 
YOUR CHILD WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO 
TO SCHOOL OR YOU WON'T HAVE 
BENEFITS HOW INSULTING IS THAT 
IT'S SAYING THAT IT'S ONLY PARENTS 
ON BENEFIT WHO IS ARE SAYING THIS 
IS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE THE 
TRIPLE JAB A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 
VERY EDUCATED EARNING A HIGH 
INCOME SAY THEY WON'T DO IT EITHER 
IT'S PATRONISING AND VERY NEGATIVE 
CHILD BENEFIT IS UNIVERSAL 
BENEFIT AND SIR SANDY MACARA 
SAYING THIS WOULD BE UNIVERSAL AS 
WELL 
I UNDERSTAND THAT NOW BUT WELL I'D SAY IN THAT CASE GIVE PEOPLE A 
ONE OFF BONUS FOR BRINGING THEIR 
CHILDREN IN TO GET THEM VACCINATED 
IF THE ISSUE IS INDIFFERENCE BUR 
IF THE ISSUE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE 
SCARED AND THEY'VE HEARD A LOT 
ABOUT THIS JAB THEY DON'T KNOW 
WHAT IS HAPPENING THEN EDUCATE 
THEM THIS ARTICLE ATTACKED THE 
TABLOIDS AND ATTACKED THE PARENTS 
AND SAID THAT LABOUR WAS GREAT IF IF YOU THINK OF THE PRACTICALITIES IN 
TERMS OF THE SCHOOLS HOW COULD 
THEY KNOW IF A CHILD WAS VACCINATED 
IF THERE IS ONE CHILD IN A SCHOOL 
WHO YOU CAN'T BE SURE ABOUT THE 
DAMAGE IS DONE 
EXACTLY WHAT I'D 
SAY TOO IF PEOPLE ARE FRIGHTENED 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS THEY'VE READ 
THINGS IN THE PAPERS AND DON'T KNOW 
WHAT IS HAPPENING OFFER SINGLE 
JABS IF THE ISSUE IS WE HAVE SUCH 
A TERRIBLE HEALTH RISK GOING ON 
THEN HANG THE EXPENSE GIVE PEOPLE 
THE OPTION OF THE SINGLE JABS THEN 
YOU WILL KNOW WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE 
THEY'RE FRIGHTENED OF A TRIPLE JAB 
OR BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST INDIFFERENT 
AND THEN ATTACK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
INDIFFERENT IN A WAY HONEY RATHER 
THAN VINEGAR 
IF YOU OFFER SINGLE 
JABS THEY'RE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE 
THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT TO FUND 
THEY ARE YOU ARE EXPECTING SCHOOLS 
AND TEACHERS TO ACTUALLY MONITOR 
THIS WHAT ABOUT HEALTH VISITORS 
NOTICED IN THE ARTICLE THAT THEY 
DENIGRATE THEM THOSE ARE THE 
PEOPLE WHO KNOW ABOUT THIS IT JUST 
SEEMS VERY CACK HANDED AND NOT VERY 
INTELLIGENT 
I AM JUST TRYING TO THINK WHETHER 
THERE HAS BEEN ANY KIND OF 
PRESIDENT A HEALTH ISSUE WHERE 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FORCED OBLIGED 
TO HAVE A VACCINATION IS THERE 
ANYTHING SIMILAR 
NOTHING THAT I 
KNOW OF AND CHILDREN IN BRITAIN 
HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF 
VACCINATION BY THE TIME THEY ARE 
TWO YEARS OLD TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT 
VACCINATIONS AND THINGS THAT THEY 
ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE PEOPLE ARE 
BEGINNING TO SAY WAIT A MINUTE 
MAYBE CHILDREN DON'T NEED THAT MUCH 
MUCH THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
MORE OF AN ETHICAL ISSUE WITH THAT 
I BELIEVE IN VACCINATION I BELIEVE 
CHILDREN SHOULD BE VACCINATED 
THANK GOD WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE 
LITTLE I DID NOT HAVE TO MAKE THE 
DECISION REGARDING M. M. R. THEY ALL 
GOT SINGLE VACCINATIONS L. DO NOT 
SEE WHY WE CAN'T DO THAT NOW TO TO YOU THINK IT IS A SIGNIFICANT 
ENOUGH PROBLEM TO WARRANT ATTENTION 
ON THIS SCALE EVEN SUGGESTING THAT 
CHILD BENEFIT CAN BE WITHDRAWN 
THAT'S WHAT I DON'T KNOW I AM NOT 
A MEDICAL PERSON I'M 
PSYCHOLOGIST I DO KNOW THAT THEY 
ARE SAYING WE HAVE THIS TROUBLE THE 
NUMBER OF WHOOPING COUGH HOW MANY 
IS TROUBLE IS IT GOING FROM TWO 
CASES TO SIX IF WE HAVE AN 
EPIDEMIC THAT IS ONE ISSUE IF WE 
DON'T HAVE AN EPIDEMIC YET THEN 
LET'S BRING PEOPLE ALONG WITH US 
BY THE WAY IT WASN'T ONLY THE 
TABLOIDS THAT TALKED ABOUT THE M. M. R. 
JAB IT WAS THE BROADSHEETS IT WAS 
ON THE SERIOUS TELEVISION 
PROGRAMMES RADIO PROGRAMMES SO I 
JUST THINK IT'S VERY PATRONISING 
AND NEGATIVE 
WE CAN SPEAK NOW TO 
ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO IS SUGGESTING 
THIS POSSIBILITY OF LINKING IT TO 
CHILD BENEFIT ON THE FACE OF IT 
IS THIS SOMETHING YOU COULD 
REALISTICALLY BRING IN 
IT IS DONE 
IN QUITE A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES AND 
IT IS ACCEPTED BECAUSE IT IS 
RECOGNISED THAT IT'S NOT A MATTER 
OF PENALISING ANYBODY BUT A MATTER 
OF PROVIDING AN ACTIVE INCENTIVE 
FOR PARENTS TO APPRECIATE THAT IT 
IS IN THE INTERESTS OF THEIR 
CHILDREN AND OF COURSE OF THE 
WHOLE POPULATION THAT CHILDREN 
SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND THAT WE 
SHOULD ACHIEVE THE HERD IMMUNITY 
WHICH HAS BEEN PROPERLY REHEARSED 
AT SOMETHING OF THE ORDER OF NINETY FIVE PER CENT 
IS IT NOT THE CASE THAT YOU COULD 
NEVER BE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CERTAIN THAT NO ONE 
IN A SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLE HAD NOT 
HAD THE M. M. R. VACCINE YOU COULD NOT 
GUARANTEE THAT IF YOU COULD NOT 
GUARANTEE THAT THEN THE HERD 
IMMUNISATION SIMPLY IS NOT GOING TO 
WORK 
I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT WORK GUARANTEEING THAT EVERY CHILD HAS 
BEEN IMMUNISED BECAUSE INDEED 
THERE ARE CASES WHERE IT WOULD NOT 
BE WISE TO IMMUNISE A CHILD WHO WAS 
IMMUNOLOGICALLY COMPROMISED WHO 
WAS SUFFERING FROM SOME CONDITION 
WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE THEM OR INDEED 
OF COURSE SOMEBODY WHOSE PARENTS 
HAVE REAL RELIGIOUS OBJECTION ONE 
SIMPLY DOES NOT WANT TO FORCE THIS 
ON ANY ONE AND IT IS NOT AN 
ATTEMPT TO BE PATRONISING IT IS AN 
ATTEMPT TO FIND WAYS OF ENCOURAGING 
PEOPLE TO DO WHAT IS BEST FOR 
THEMSELVES AND FOR EVERYONE ELSE 
BUT YOU WOULD BE FORCING IT ON THEM 
WOULD YOU NOT IF YOU ARE SAYING 
THAT CHILD CANNOT GO TO SCHOOL 
UNLESS THEY HAVE HAD IT THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU ARE 
FORCING THEM 
YOU COULD REGARD 
THIS AS A CHOICE IN A FREE SOCIETY 
PEOPLE WHO ARE DETERMINED NOT TO 
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN IMMUNISED FOR 
NO GOOD REASON WOULD THEN HAVE TO 
BE ERM HAVE TO RECOGNISE THAT 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO JUSTIFY THEIR 
POSITION BUT IF THEY WERE TO 
RECEIVE A BENEFIT SUCH AS ADMISSION 
TO A DAY NURSERY A NURSERY SCHOOL 
OR INDEED PRIMARY EDUCATION AFTER 
ALL ALL OF THESE BENEFITS IN OUR 
SOCIETY ARE FREE AND THERE SHOULD 
BE SOME EVIDENCE OF RESPONSIBILITY 
FROM PEOPLE WHO EXPECT TO RECEIVE 
BENEFITS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH HE BENEFITS HAS OUTLINED THE POSITION ARE YOU 
ANY FURTHER TOWARDS BEING 
CONVINCED 
I AM NOT BECAUSE IF YOU CONVINCED ARE GOING TO ALLOW SOME PEOPLE TO 
BE EXCLUDED ON RELIGIOUS GROUNDS 
OR FOR MEDICAL REASONS WHY THEY 
CANNOT HAVE IT DONE THEN IF I WERE 
A PARENT WHO WAS WORRIED I WOULD 
SAY IT'S ON RELIGIOUS GROUNDS 
SO I THEY EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE IT 
FOR THE GOOD OF SOCIETY AND THERE 
SHOULD BE NO EXCEPTIONS AND NOBODY 
CAN GO TO SCHOOL OR THERE ARE 
EXCEPTIONS AND IF THERE ARE THEN 
I THINK THE ARGUMENT BREAKS DOWN

THE HEADLINES NOW MINISTERS ARE 
TO SAY THAT THE SOCIAL CARE SYSTEM 
IN ENGLAND IS HEADING FOR 
SHORTFALL OF SIX BILLION UNLESS IT 
UNDERGOES RADICAL REFORM A

ANDREW IS HERE TO HAVE A LOOK 
THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS WITH US 
THIS IS THE MAIL ON SUNDAY SAYING 
THAT GORDON BROWN AND LABOUR ARE 
FACING DISASTER IN THE CREWE BY 
ELECTION THIS IS THE SUNDAY 
EXPRESS TALKING ABOUT A BAN AT 
SCHOOL IF KIDS HAVE NOT HAD THE M. M. R. 
JAB THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH THIS 
MORNING CLAIMS AN EXCLUSIVE THAT 
GORDON BROWN HAS VOWED TO DO 
WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO KEEP THE 
UNITED KINGDOM TOGETHER THAT'S 
BECAUSE THERE HAS JUST BEEN 
BRUISING BATTLE OVER A POSSIBLE 
REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE 
AND THE NEWS OF THE WORLD THEY 
HAVE HAD LOOK INSIDE THE FLAT 
WHERE MADELEINE MCCANN WENT MISSING 
AND THEY HAVE GOT VARIOUS PLANS OF 
THE PLACE SUGGESTING THAT THERE ARE 
A NUMBER OF SECRET HIDING PLACES 
WHERE SOMEBODY COULD HAVE HIDDEN 
AND THIS IS THE INDEPENDENT ON 
SUNDAY REPORTING THAT SERVING 
SOLDIERS ARE LIVING IN POVERTY 
SOME TROOPS CAN'T EVEN AFFORD TO 
EAT PROPERLY ACCORDING TO 
DOCUMENTS THEY HAVE SEEN 
YES I THINK THIS CARTOON SPEAKS 
VOLUMES IT IS ABOUT THE ABSOLUTELY 
SHOCKING POSITION IN BURMA THIS IS 
A SKELETAL GENERAL SITTING ABOVE 
BODIES DROWNING IN THE WATER AND 
IT SAYS THEY ARE WAVING NOT 
DROWNING IT IS QUITE ASTONISHING 
WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE EVEN MORE 
ASTONISHING THAT THEY CARRIED ON 
WITH THE REFERENDUM ON THE 
CONSTITUTION AS WE KNOW MASSES OF 
AID IS NOT GETTING IN THERE ARE 
SOME GRAPHIC STORIES IN THE PAPERS 
TODAY INCLUDING ONE OF HOW A 
PREGNANT WOMAN WAS GIVING BIRTH TO 
A CHILD AND DIED HALFWAY THROUGH 
CHILDBIRTH WHICH MEANT THAT THE 
CHILD DIALLED TOO JUST A SMALL 
EXAMPLE BUT THEY ARE IMPERVIOUS TO 
PROTESTS FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
CHINA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY WITH ANY 
LEVERAGE AND THEY SO FAR HAVE NOT 
APPLIED ANY LEVERAGE 
WE HAVE BEEN 
HEARING THROUGHOUT THE MORNING THAT 
THERE IS THIS FRUSTRATION BY THE 
AID AGENCIES BUT THAT IS A KIND OF 
EUPHEMISM IT IS ACTUALLY ANGER AND 
SADNESS 
YES YOU SENSE THIS THIS SADNESS IS GETTING ON TO THE SCALE OF THIS 
A MUMMY YOU SENSE THAT THIS 
ON TO THE SCALE OF THE TSUNAMI 
OXFAM ARE WARNING OF THE HUGE 
NUMBERS OF DEATHS WHICH THERE COULD 
BE THIS MORNING MOVING ON TO 
SOMETHING MUCH LIGHTER 
WE LOVE ALL 
OF THIS DON'T WE THIS IS THE 
SUNDAY TELEGRAPH'S COVERAGE OF 
TERRY WOGAN AND HIS EUROVISION 
QUIPS THE GUY WHO RUNS EUROVISION 
WHO IS A DANE IS VERY UNHAPPY HE 
SAYS TERRY WOGAN HAS MADE 
EUROVISION A LAUGHING STOCK AND 
THE BRITISH PEOPLE DON'T TAKE IT 
SERIOUSLY HE IS DEAD RIGHT MOST 
OF US ONLY WATCH IT FOR TERRY 
WOGAN'S COMMENTARY THEY HAVE 
PICKED OUT ONE PARTICULAR YEAR WHEN 
TERRY WOGAN DESCRIBED IT AS THE 
MUSIC LOVER'S HAMLET HE THEN ASKED 
WHO KNOWS WHAT HELLISH FUTURE LIES 
AHEAD WELL OF COURSE HE DID 
BECAUSE HE HAD SEEN THE REHEARSALS 
ONE OF THE THINGS WE FIND SO FUNNY 
ABOUT IT IS THAT OTHER PEOPLE TAKE 
IT SO SERIOUSLY 
EXACTLY IN SWEDEN 
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT COMPETITION 
GOOD LUCK TO THE SWEDES BUT WE 
HAVE NOT TAKEN IT SERIOUSLY SINCE 
BROTHERHOOD OF MAN 
DO YOU THINK 
ANYTHING WOULD ENABLE US TO TAKE IT 
MORE SERIOUSLY IF THEY CHANGED ITS 
NAME OR REBRANDED IT 
I SUPPOSE IF 
THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 
STOPPED VOTING FOR EACH OTHER END 
MASS THE SERBIANS AND THE 
MONTENEGRINS WE MIGHT JUST START 
TAKING IT MORE SERIOUSLY EN 
MASSE 
AND THERE WAS A STORY ABOUT MASSE CLIFF RICHARD AND HOW THE 
SPANISH 
IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST SPANISH WINNERS IN HISTORY WE STILL THINK 
HE WON DON'T WE 
I THOUGHT HE HAD 
RATHER THAN THE SPANISH ONE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT MICHAEL 
HOWARD IS UP TO 
WELL AS A. N. N. 
WIDDECOMBE ONCE SAID ABOUT MICHAEL 
HOWARD SOMETHING OF THE NIGHT 
WELL HE IS NOW SUING HIS SOFTER 
SIDE APPARENTLY HE IS A BETTER 
KISSER THAN SANDRA HIS WIFE 
ACCORDING TO WHO 
SHE 
SAID THAT HE HE SAID SHE WAS AND SHE SAID THAT HE WAS 
THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM BETTER WAS THAT MAKES THEM EQUALLY AS GOOD I I THINK IT'S TOO MUCH DETAIL FRANKLY 
HE ALSO GOES ON ABOUT HIS NOCTURNAL 
TRIPS TO THE LOO THEY'VE BEEN 
MARRIED FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS THEY DIDN'T 
WIN THIS MR. AND MRS. COMPETITION 
THE COUPLE THAT ONE THEY HAD BEEN 
MARRIED FOR FOUR YEARS IF YOU HAVE 
BEEN MARRIED FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS CAN'T 
YOU GET THE QUESTIONS RIGHT 
NOCTURNAL TRIPS TO THE LOO YES YES THAT'S WHAT IT SOMETHING OF THE 
NIGHT IS FOR HIM HE SAID 
MAYBE IF HE HAD SHOWN MORE OF THIS 
CHARACTER THEY WOULD HAVE DONE 
BETTER IN THE GENERAL ELECTION HOW HOW WOULD YOU KNOW HOW GOOD A KISSER 
YOU ARE 
I'VE NO IDEA I CERTAINLY 
WOULDN'T KNOW HOW GOOD AT KISSER 
MICHAEL HOWARD IS THAT'S FOR SURE 
THAT'S RELIEF 
THIS IS ALAN SUGAR 
HE HAS HAD HIS FORTIETH WEDDING 
ANNIVERSARY PARTY PIERS MORGAN WAS

BIRTHDAY ALAN SUGAR SENT HIS WIFE

DIVORCE AND HE REPLIED I WASN'T 
THINKING OF SPENDING THAT MUCH 
COMING UP HERE ON BREAKFAST

JOINING US THIS MORNING THIS MUST 
HAVE LEFT EVERYBODY THERE EXTREMELY 
SHOCKED SHOCKED IT DID THE WHOLE COMMUNITY AND THE 
PARISH EVERYBODY'S ALL OF US ARE 
TOTALLY NUMBED AND SHOCKED AT THE 
MOMENT MOMENT JIMMY MIZZEN WAS AN ALTAR BOY AT 
YOUR CHURCH WHAT WAS HE LIKE 
JIMMY HAS BEEN AN ALTAR SERVER BUT 
I CAME TO THE PARISH ONLY IN 
SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND FIVE THEN HE HAD MOVED 
ON BUT HIS YOUNGER BROTHER GEORGE 
IS STILL SERVING IN MASS EVERY 
WEEKEND WEEKEND WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO LOCAL PEOPLE

CONCERN WHERE YOU ARE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY AT THE 
MOMENT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY IS 
TOTALLY SHOCKED MET THE PARENTS 
AND THE WHOLE FAMILY THEY ARE 
NUMBED AND NOBODY HAS ANY WORDS TO 
EXPRESS THE DEEP SHOCK AND THE 
DEVASTATION AND THE NUMBNESS AMONG 
THE FAMILY AND AMONG THE WHOLE 
COMMUNITY OUR PARISH COMMUNITY IS 
TOTALLY DEVASTATED THEY NEVER 
THOUGHT THING LIKE THIS COULD 
HAPPEN TO ANYBODY IN THIS AREA 
WHEN YOU SAY THEY NEVER THOUGHT 
ANYTHING LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN 
CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE LOCAL AREA AND 
CONCERNS ABOUT CRIME THERE 
IT'S A VERY QUIET PLACE PEOPLE 
MOVE AROUND OPENLY AND THEY ARE 
VERY FRIENDLY THEY'RE VERY 
SUPPORTIVE OF EACH OTHER IT'S A 
LOVELY COMMUNITY BUT THINGS LIKE 
THIS HAPPENS WHEN THING LIKE THIS HAPPENS EVERYBODY'S SHOCKED 
AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE THE 
WHOLE SITUATION 
FATHER EDWARD PERERA WE REALLY 
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THIS MORNING 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE TIME IS EIGHT FORTY THREE A M. 
OUR HEADLINES 
MINISTERS ARE TO WARN THE SOCIAL 
CARE SYSTEM IN ENGLAND IS HEADING 
FOR A SHORTFALL OF SIX BILLION 
UNLESS IT UNDERGOES RADICAL REFORM 
AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING A TEENAGER 
HAS BEEN MURDERED THE DAY AFTER HIS 
SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY PRAYERS WILL BE SAID 
FOR JIMMY MIZZEN AT HIS LOCAL 
CHURCH IN SOUTH EAST LONDON THIS 
MORNING 
LOVE MAY BE BLIND BUT DOES IT HAVE 
A KEEN SENSE OF HEARING RESEARCH 
OUT TODAY HAS DEFINED A NEW SOCIAL 
TYPE A MALE VERSION OF THE WIFE 
AND GIRLFRIEND OR WAG THE 
BOYFRIEND WHO IS A GOLD DIRGE A 
BAG IN A MOMENT WE WILL ASK 
COMMENTATOR PIERS HENRU IF HE 
AGREES WE WENT TO TRY AND FIND A 
BAG BAG MAYBE I'M OLD FASHIONED BELIEVE 
THERE HAS TO BE SOME KIND PASSION 
OR ATTRACTION L. DON'T THINK THE 
MONEY FACTOR IS ENOUGH ON ITS OWN 
LOVE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MONEY 
BECAUSE MEN WORK REAL MAN WILL 
WORK AND MAKE MONEY HE SHOULD GIVE 
IT TO THE WOMAN AS OPPOSED TO BEING 
THE OTHER WAY AROUND 
AWANT TO BE 
HAPPY I WANT TO BE WITH SOMEONE I 
CAN ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH MONEY 
IS NOT A BIG ISSUE FOR ME 
IF YOU AN ACE WOMAN WHO IS GOING 
TOO COME ALONG AND OFFER ME A LOT 
OF MONEY THEN I MIGHT TAKE YOU UP 
ON IT 
WELL NOT WITH MY WIFE HERE 
MICHELLE ELIOTT FROM KIDSCAPE IS 
HERE 
I THINK PERHAPS MEN HAVE SLOWLY 
COME TO THE REALISATION THAT WOMEN 
WANT EQUALITY PRETTY MUCH ONLY WHEN 
IT SUITS THEM THEY WANT TO EARN AS 
MUCH AS US BUT THEY WANT TO BE 
TAKEN OUT FOR DINNER THEY WANT US 
TO CHANGE NAPPIES BUT THEY EXPECT 
TO GET CUSTODY OF THE KIDS THIS IS 
AN EXAMPLE WHERE PERHAPS EQUALITY 
MIGHT SUIT US L. THINK IN THE WORLD 
OF CREDIT CRUNCHES AND DIMINISHING 
RESOURCES IF YOU CAN FOR THE YOUR 
NEST BY FINDING A RICH WOMAN THEN 
I THINK MOST BLOKES WOULD THINK 
GOOD LUCK TO YOU 
DO YOU KNOW 
ANYONE WHO OPENLY ADMITS TO HAVING 
DONE THAT OR SEEKING TO DO THAT 
YES I HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE 
PUB THE IDEA OF RICH GIRL FRIEND 
IS FANTASTIC 
BUT THERE IS A 
DIFFERENCE IS THERE NOT FROM A 
CONVERSATION IN THE PUB AND 
ACTUALLY SORT OF SAYING I AM 
DOING THIS FOR THIS REASON 
THERE IS DIFFERENCE BUT I THINK 
A LOT OF MEN IN THE MODERN ERA 
THINK WHY NOT WE HAVE CEDED SO 
MUCH TERRITORY TO WOMEN IN SO MANY 
WAYS IF YOU DO HAPPEN TO STRIKE 
LUCKY THEN I DON'T THINK MANY MEN 
WOULD HAVE MANY FOIBLES OR MORALS 
OR ANY PROBLEM WITH EMASCULATION 
OVER FINDING THEIR INCOME FROM A 
WOMAN WHO IS MINTED 
DO YOU THINK 
IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH HAS 
NOW COME INTO THE EQUATION WHEN 
YOU LOOK AT MARRYING SOMEONE AND 
SPENDING YOUR LIFE WITH THEM 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE BANK BALANCE 
AS WELL AS EVERYTHING ELSE 
YES I 
THINK QUITE NATURALLY IT'S AN 
UNFORTUNATE BUT NECESSARY THING IF 
YOU MARRY A WOMAN WHO HAS NO INCOME 
FOR INSTANCE THEN YOU REALISE THAT 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE 
IT'LL IF SHE HAS GOT A MUCH BIGGER 
INCOME THEN YOU THEN YOU MIGHT BE 
THINKING WELL CHRISTMAS IN 
BARBADOS WITH SIMON COWELL 
SIPPING COCKTAILS ON THE BEACH 
BUT WHAT IF THE PERSON WHO YOU WERE 
THINKING OF MARRYING GOT WIND OF 
THE FACT 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO LIVE 
A LIE 
THAT'S RIGHT THE WHOLE 
THING IS SCUPPERED IF THERE IS A 
WHIFF OF GOLD DIGGING GOING ON 
THEN THERE IS NO GREATER 
CONTRACEPTION THAN THAT L. THINK IT 
MAY HAVE HAPPENED FOR INSTANCE WITH 
PAUL MCCARTNEY AND THINGS RECENTLY 
IT'S NOT A PLEASANT THING TO THINK 
HANG ON IS THIS LOVE OR IS IT 
JUST SOMEBODY FEATHERING THEIR 
FINANCIAL NEST MY EX GIRLFRIEND 
HAS JUST INHERITED THE BEST PART OF 
ONE HUNDRED MILLION 
COINCIDENTALLY I AM 
HAVING DRINKS WITH HER NEXT WEEK 
IF IT GOES TO PLAN DON'T EXPECT TO 
SEE ME HERE AT THIS HOUR ON A 
SUNDAY MORNING IN A MALL 
ANY MORE A CONTROVERSIAL NEW 
PARIS GUIDE BOOK CONCENTRATES NOT 
ON THE BUILDINGS BUT ON THE WOMEN 
WHO LIVE THERE IT LISTS WHERE YOU 
CAN SEE THE MOST ATTRACTIVE WOMEN 
IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL AND THEIR 
BEST PHYSICAL FEATURES WE WENT TO 
MEET THE AUTHOR 
FORGET THE EIFFEL TOWER AND THE OF 
TO TRIUMPH SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE 
FINER SIGHTS OF PARIS BEAUTIFUL 
ELEGANT MAGNIFICENT THE CITY'S 
WOMEN ARE GUARANTEED TO TURN HEADS 
ARC DE TRIOMPHE AND THIS MAN HAS 
WRITTEN THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE BOOK 
I THINK IT IS AMAZING THAT THEY ARE 
NOT AFRAID TO BE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN 
THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED TO BE 
BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE NOT OFFENDED 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT HER AS LONG AS 
IT'S NOT INSULTING 
SO IS THIS 
BOOK JUST A HARMLESS BIT OF FUN 
AFTER ALL WE ALL ENJOY A GOOD BIT 
OF PEOPLE WATCHING OR IS IT AS 
SOME PARISIANS ARE SUGGESTING 
SEXIST AND DEGRADING TO WOMEN 
FEMINIST WRITERS ARGUE THE GUIDE 
MAKES WOMEN LOOK LIKE LITTLE MORE 
THAN MARKET PRODUCE 
IT IS VERY SEXIST WE KNOW WHAT IS 
L. BEAUTY WE DON'T NEED THIS KIND 
OF BOOK OUR BEAUTY WE ARE NOT 
IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WE'RE IN THE 
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
THE BOOK NOTES THE 
BEST OBSERVATION POINTS FOR 
SPOTTING WOMEN AND SUGGESTS WHICH 
PARTS OF PARIS HAS THE BEST LEGS 
AND THE BEST DRESSED BUT HAVE 
OTHER MEN NOTICED ANYTHING ABOUT 
THE FRENCH WOMEN 
ESPECIALLY NOW IN 
SPRING I AM THINKING ABOUT 
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS WALKING IN NICE 
DRESS AND YEAH 
THERE ARE A LOT 
OF VERY NICE WOMEN WELL DRESSED 
ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE ARE A LOT 
OF TOURISTS NOT SO GOOD DRESSED 
THE AUTHOR INSISTS IT WAS JUST A 
GAME AND THE AIM IS NOT POSSESSION 
THE FEMALE WONDERS OF PARIS ARE A 
FEAST FOR THE EYES ONLY 
NOW ARE YOU APPROACHING FIFTY WHAT 
WERE YOU DOING LAST NIGHT IF YOU 
ARE LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE YEAR 
OLD WAS UP TO WOT WON FORTY NINE YEAR 
OLD WAS UP TO WHAT 
SOMETIMES I THINK WHAT I NEED IS 
A NEW ADVENTURE THE WAY THAT YOU MOVE 
MADONNA PERFORMING LIVE ON STAGE 
DOWN IN MAIDSTONE IN KENT SHE IS 
NUMBER ONE IN THE CHARTS AT THE 
MOMENT SHE'S THE WORLD'S TOP 
EARNING FEMALE SINGLES ARTIST 
KICKING OFF WORLD TOUR IN THE U. K. 
THIS YEAR BUT SHE IS FIFTY IN AUGUST 
SO SHOULD SHE BE STEPPING OUT IN 
THE LIMELIGHT LISA I WILL ASK YOU 
FIRST BECAUSE YOU WERE THERE LAST 
NIGHT A WAS AND IT LOOKS BETTER 
THERE THAN IT DID IN THE TENT LAST 
NIGHT 
THE SOUND WAS NOT GREAT NIGHT NORMALLY MADONNA'S GIGS THEY ARE 
HER SHOW BUT THIS WAS JUST SORT OF 
STEPPING OUT INTO A TENT IT IS NOT 
REALLY HER THING 
JUST GIVE ME A 
SENSE OF THE AUDIENCE IT IS A 
RADIO ONE EVENT SO PRESUMABLY A 
RELATIVELY YOUNG AUDIENCE A A ANYTHING SHE DID THEY WERE 
SCREAMING BUT WHAT I DID NOTICE 
WAS THAT MADONNA IS VERY INTENT ON 
BEING RELEVANT TO YOUNG PEOPLE 
THIS IS WHY SHE PUTS SO MUCH EFFORT 
INTO NEW ALBUMS MADONNA WANTS TO 
GET YOUNG PEOPLE COMING TO HER GIGS 
BUT WHAT I DID NOTICE WAS THAT AT 
THE END IT WAS QUITE A SHORT SHOW 
A LOT OF KIDS CAME UP TO ME AND 
SAID SHE DID NOT PLAY HOLIDAY 
ACTUALLY IN THE AGE OF THE I. POD 
PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO HER OLDER 
STUFF 
IS SHE SUFFICIENT OF A STUFF GLOBAL STAR NOW SO THAT THE AGE 
THING IS A NON ISSUE 
I MEAN 
EVERYBODY EVEN THE YOUNG KIDS NO 
MADONNA IS SHE IS THE PIED PIPER 
OF MUSIC WHAT I LOVE ABOUT HER 
SHE IS KIND OF LIKE THE QUEEN OF 
POP AND THE QUEEN OF REINVENTION 
SHE HAS BASED THE WHOLE OF HER 
CAREER ON REINVENTING HER LOOK SHE 
HAS HEAVILY INFLUENCED THE FASHION 
AND MUSIC INDUSTRIES EVERYBODY 
KNOWS EXACTLY WHO SHE IS WHAT I 
LOVE IS HER MOST FAMOUS OF THE 
MOST FAMOUS ITEM OF HER CLOTHING 
BY JEAN PAUL GAUTIER IT IS SO 
FUNNY OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE DRESS LIKE 
HER NOW BUT BACK THEN IN THE 
NINETEEN NINETIES CHILDREN WERE SO OBSESSED 
WITH HER IMAGE THAT THEY WERE 
RAIDING THEIR PARENTS' RAIDING 
THEIR MUM'S UNDERWEAR DRAWER AND 
COPYING THE WHOLE MOLE THING BY 
PUTTING A MOLE ON THEIR FACES 
EXACTLY WHERE MADONNA HAD ONE 
LOOKING AT SOME OF THAT FOOTAGE 
FROM THE BEGINNING OF HER CAREER 
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT IN THIS 
DAY AND AGE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN AS 
BIG AS SHE IS ALSO DOING THE KIND 
OF SHOW THAT SHE IS 
SHE IS 
INCREDIBLY FIT SHE PUTS A LOT OF 
WORK INTO IT THE CHOREOGRAPHY AND 
THE PROPS ARE GREAT THE CLOTHES 
ARE GREAT MUSICALLY SHE KINDS OF 
GIVES UP ON THE MUSIC FOR THE 
SPECTACLE THE MUSIC IS YOU KNOW 
BUT HOWEVER MANY ROPEY ALBUMS SHE 
PUTS OUT SHE JUST POWERS ON 
THROUGH BECAUSE SHE IS SUCH A GREAT 
PERFORMER 
WHAT IS THE POINT AT PERFORMER WHICH IT COULD UNRAVEL PEOPLE 
MIGHT START TO SAY SHE DOESN'T LOOK 
RIGHT FOR EXAMPLE 
FOR MADONNA 
IT IS ALL ABOUT STAYING RELEVANT 
SHE COULD GO ON AND KEEP PLAYING 
THOSE HITS BUT SHE WANTS TO BRING 
OUT A NEW ALBUM AND HAVE MORE HITS 
AND PLAY THOSE NEW SONGS BECAUSE I 
THINK SHE WOULD RATHER GIVE UP THAN 
GO OUT AND PLAY HAROLD NUMBERS ALL 
THE TIME 
I DON'T THINK WE WILL 
EVER SEE HER OFF THE STAGE TO BE 
HONEST SHE LOOKS SO DIFFERENT ALL 
THE TIME PLAY HER OLD NUMBERS 
EVEN WHEN SHE IS EIGHTY YEARS OLD 
BIONIC WOMAN HAVE YOU ACTUALLY SEE 
IN THE BACK OF HER NEW ALBUM IT'S 
PRETTY FULL ON RAUNCHY 
THE YEAH RAUNCHY IT'S ALMOST PORNOGRAPHIC SHE IS 
FIVE YEARS YOUNGER THAN MY MUM SHE 
IS USING THE MICROPHONE LIKE A BIT 
OF A SEX TOY REALLY IF THAT WAS 
MY MUM I'D BE REALLY EMBARRASSED 
I AM SURE HER DAUGHTER IS TOTALLY 
EMBARRASSED 
IF THERE IS A EMBARRASSED CRITICISM THE THIS SAY THAT IT 
MIGHT BE UNDIGNIFIED THAT WORD 
COMES IN 
SHE IS DEFINITELY TRYING 
TOO HARD NOW SHE IS TRYING TO BE 
RAUNCHY I THINK SHE SHOULD JUST 
KIND OF 
JAYA RATING AROUND THE 
STAGE WITH JUSTIN TIMBER LIKE IT'S 
KIND OF MUM AND SON 
YOU CAN 
COMPARE IT TO OTHER FIFTY YEAR OLD 
WOMAN BUT SHE IS A POP STAR WHEN 
YOU SEE HER OFF DUTY FANTASTIC 
BUT SHE HAS GOT TO DO SOMETHING ON 
STAGE SHE IS FANTASTIC SHE WOULD 
PROBABLY RATHER WE WERE SITTING
