RONALDO BECAUSE HE HAS LOADS OF 
SKILLS AND HE MIGHT WIN THE CUP FOR 
UNITED

DRIBBLING 
I THINK THEY CAN'T DO IT DRIBBLING WITHOUT RONALDO BECAUSE HE'S GOT 
GOOD SKILL AND HE'S REALLY GOOD 
WITH THE BALL AND SCORE GOALS I I THINK HE'S THE DEFINITELY THE BEST 
PLAYER IN THE WORLD L. L. THINK HE 
COULD SCORE ABOUT NINETY GOALS THIS 
YEAR 
WELL IF 
HE SCORES THAT MANY YEAR HE WILL BE IN WITH WINNING THE TWO 
AWARDS HE'S UP FOR THIS WEEKEND HE 
WILL WANT TO PUT IN A GOOD 
PERFORMANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS
