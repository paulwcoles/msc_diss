CONCERNS OVER CONFIDENTIALITY WHERE 
A THIRD OF LONDON COUNCILS ADMIT 
LOSING OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WE 
GET OLYMPIC TIPS ON HOW TO AVOID 
SCENES LIKE THESE FROM THE FILM 
MAKER BEHIND CHARIOTS OF FIRE 
USE THE OLYMPIC TORCH RUN IT 
AROUND EVERY TOWN AND VILLAGE IN 
BRITAIN 
GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE 
PROGRAMME A FRESH INVESTIGATION IS 
UNDERWAY INTO THE NUMBER OF WOMEN 
DYING AT A MATERNITY UNIT IN NORTH 
LONDON N. THE PAST TEN MONTHS THREE 
NEW MOTHERS HAVE DIED AT NORTHWICK 
PARK HOSPITAL THAT IS SEVEN TIMES 
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IT IS NOT THE 
FIRST TIME THE UNIT HAS BEEN UNDER 
SCRUTINY THREE YEARS AGO IT WAS 
PLACED UNDER SPECIAL MEASURES FOR 
HAVING A HIGHER THAN AVERAGE 
MORTALITY RATE THE LATEST DEATH 
HERE AT NORTHWICK PARK HOSPITAL WAS 
JUST AL FEW WEEKS AGO A TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD 
WOMAN FROM AFGHANISTAN DIED AFTER 
GOING INTO LABOUR SHE WAS SUFFER 
FROM HEAVY BLEEDING AND PASSED A 
AWAY FROM MULTI ORGAN FAILURE TWO 
OTHER WOMEN HAVE ALSO DIED IN THE 
PAST TEN MONTHS 
WITHOUT GOING INTO 
PATIENT DETAIL I CAN SAY NONE OF 
THESE ARE TO DO WITH HAEMORRHAGE 
AT THE MOMENT THERE IS NO COMMON 
UNDERLYING FACTOR IN ANY OF THE 
DEATHS WE ARE VERY MUCH AWARE OF 
THAT POSSIBILITY AT THE MOMENT WE 
ARE HAVING INVESTIGATED EACH 
INDIVIDUAL INCIDENT CONDUCTING A 
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF THE ERRORS 
MANY OF THE MOTHERS WE SPOKE TO HAD 
A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE 
MATERNITY CARE 
I HAD MY BABY HERE 
IT IS A VERY GOOD NICE HOSPITAL 
THE STAFF AND DOCTORS VERY AMAZING 
WELL I AM A GRAN GRANDDAD THIS IS 
MY GRAN GRAN DAUGHTER SHE IS SIX 
POUNDS THEY ARE HAPPY 
EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
AGO SPECIAL MEASURES WERE LIFTED 
THEY WERE IMPLEMENTED AS THE DEATH 
RATE HERE WAS HIGHER THAN THE 
NATIONAL AVERAGE OVER THREE YEARS 
TEN WOMEN HAD DIED DURING LABOUR 
THE FAMILY OF THIS YOUNG MOTHER 
SUCCESSFULLY SUED WHEN SHE DIED 
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
IT IS VERY CONCERNED 
I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT IT WHAT THE 
FATHER HOPED MORE THAN ANYTHING 
FROM SUING THE TRUST WAS TO STOP 
THIS HAPPENING AGAIN FOLLOWING FOLLOWING THOSE DEATHS AND THE SPECIAL 
MEASURES THE HOSPITAL INVESTED NINETEEN 
MILLION IN MATERNITY CARE THIS 
TIME NO EXTRA MONEY HAS BEEN 
PROMISED BUT A THOROUGH INQUIRY IS 
UNDERWAY LOTS MORE TO COME TONIGHT 
INCLUDING 
THEY MAY LOOK PRETTY INCLUDING YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE THE COMMOTION 
THESE LAMPPOSTS HAVE CAUSED 
A B. B. C. INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED 
PERSONAL AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION 
ABOUT PEOPLE LIVING IN LONDON HAS 
BEEN LOST BY ONE IN THREE OF THE 
CAPITAL'S COUNCILS IN ONE CASE 
INFORMATION ABOUT VULNERABLE 
CHILDREN IN CARE WAS STOLEN FROM A 
COUNCIL WORKER'S BAG IN BAR THE 
B. B. C. ASKED LONDON'S COUNCILS HOW 
MANY TIMES THEY LOST DATA ABOUT 
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THIRTEEN BOROUGHS 
THE ONES HIGHLIGHTED HERE ADMITTED 
LOSING IMPORTANT AND SENSITIVE 
INFORMATIONMENT THAT IS HALF OF THE 
COUNCILS WHICH RESPONDED TO OUR 
REQUEST THE ROYAL BOROUGH OF 
KENSINGTON AND AMP CHELSEA ADMITTED THREE 
DATA LOSSES OVER FIVE MONTHS IN 
SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR SOCIAL WORKER 
HAD THEIR BAG STOLEN FROM BAR IT 
CONTAINED COURT REPORTS AND 
INFORMATION ABOUT A YOUNG PERSON'S 
SPECIAL NEEDS IN JANUARY THIS YEAR 
A YOUTH WORKER HAD THEIR NOTE BOOK 
STOLEN IT HAD DATA ON TWELVE CHILDREN 
CARE AND A LAPTOP CONTAINING 
PERSONAL DETAILS WAS STOLEN FROM A 
COFFEE SHOP IT IS VERY WORRYING 
ACCORDING TO A GROUP WHO WORK WITH 
CHILDREN IN CARE 
SOME OF THE DATA 
STOLEN WAS CONTACT DETAILS OF 
CHILDREN IN CARE AGAIN THIS IS A 
VERY VULNERABLE GROUP IF SOMEBODY 
WITH THE WRONG MOTIVATION GETS HOLD 
OF THAT THEN IT CAN BE DANGEROUS 
KENSINGTON AND AMP CHELSEA SAY THEY TAKE 
THE SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA 
EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY AND THE THREE 
MEMBERS OF STAFF WERE VICTIMS OF 
THEFT ALL THREE INCIDENTS WERE 
INVESTIGATED PROMPTLY AND 
MANAGEMENT ACTION WAS TAKEN THE 
BODY WHICH REPRESENTS COUNCILS IN 
LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST SAY 
BOROUGHS NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR 
SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS 
WHAT WE ARE 
DOING IS WORKING THE SECTOR TO 
CREATE A SET OF GUIDELINES TO HELP 
AVOID JUST THESE SORT OF INCIDENTS 
SO WE COULD SEE THOSE WANTING TO 
ADOPTED ACROSS ALL COUNCILS 
AT THE 
HARD HEART OF THIS IS AN ISSUE OF 
TRUST THE INFORMATION ABOUT US IS 
HELD SECURELY AFTER A RECENT 
SERIES OF BIGGEST LOSSES NATIONALLY 
THIS WILL NOT DO MUCH TO IMPROVE 
THE BELIEF THAT OUR PERSONAL DATA 
IS NOT ALWAYS AS SAFE AS WE WOULD 
LIKE LIKE ON THAT NOTE WITH ALL THE PERSONAL 
INFORMATION WE ARE ASKED FOR THESE 
DAYS DO YOU THINK IT IS LOOKED 
AFTER SECURELY ENOUGH MAYBE YOU 
HAVE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE OF 
CONFIDENTAL OR IMPORTANT DATA GOING 
THAT ADDRESS 
COMMUTERS TRYING TO GET A TRAIN OUT

TO THE RACE TO MAY YOU ALL THE 
MAIN CANDIDATES ARE GOING ON 
WALKABOUTS IN THE STREETS AND 
PUBLIC DEBATES THIS TIME THEY ARE 
MAKING USE OF CYBERSPACE 
WITH ALL CANDIDATES SEEKING THE 
PRIZED YOUTH VOTE COULD THE BATTLE 
BE WON OR LOST ON THE WEB 
THE PRIME MINISTER JOINED KEN 
LIVINGSTONE TODAY FOR ANOTHER 
TRADITIONAL CAMPAIGN PHOTO CALL 
BUT INCREASINGLY THE REAL BATTLE IS 
BEING FOUGHT ELSEWHERE 
I AM 
BACKING KEN LIVINGSTONE 
I AM 
SUPPORTING KEN LIVINGSTONE I I SUPPORT KEN LIVINGSTONE 
THE LATEST 
VIDEO CONSISTS OF PHONED IN 
TRIBUTES FROM ORDINARY LONDONERS 
IT IS THE WORK OF THE WEB TEAM 
HELPING BARACK OBAMA 
THEY ARE 
MODERN ALL THEY HAVE LEARNT IN 
AMERICA IS BEING APPLIED HERE 
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR WHO GET 
THEIR INFORMATION ABOUT THIS 
ELECTION FROM THE INTERNET 
IT IS 
NOT SURPRISING THAT LONDONERS DON'T 
FEEL SAFE 
IF YOU MISSED IT THE FIRST TIME YOU 
CAN WATCH BRIAN PADDICK'S ELECTION 
BROADCAST AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WISH 
HE TOO HAS REVAMPED HIS WEBSITE 
FORGET THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA 
NOWADAYS WHEREVER YOU GO THERE IS A 
MOBILE PHONE WAITING FOR YOU A 
MOMENT OF ANXIOUSTY AS HE PONDERS 
WHAT HE HAS JUST SAID ABOUT HIS BUS 
PLANS TO TWO LABOUR SUPPORTERS 
FILMING HIM BY PHONE IS IT HEADED 
FOR A WEBSITE 
IT WAS A COUPLE OF 
STOUDGES TRYING TO TRIP ME UP 
TRYING TO GET ME TO SAY SOMETHING 
ABOUT BUSES 
THEY ARE SPENDING MORE 
TIME ON THEIR OWN CAMPAIGN VIDEOS 
THAN ANSWERING QUESTIONS FROM 
OTHERS THAEFPB IS NOT WITHOUT ITS 
PERILS EVEN THAT IS NOT WITHOUT 
ITS PERILS 
TAKING ON THE 
CAMPAIGN 
EVEN WHEN THINLY CAMPAIGN DISGUISED AS A JOKE 
IT WAS 
WONDERFUL YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO 
USE THEM 
THIS IS THE RUN AWAY INTERNET 
SUCCESS SO FAR SOME APPARENTLY 
THOUGHT HE WAS BEING SERIOUS 
STAY WITH US STILL TO COME BEFORE 
SEVEN ZERO ZERO P. M. I AM AT STAMFORD BRIDGE 
I AM IN CAMDEN AT THE CHARITY 
PREMIER OF MIKE LEE'S NEW FILM 
HAPPY GO LUCKY 
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CELEBRATION 
OF ALL THINGS GREAT ABOUT THE 
OLYMPICS BUT THE BEIJING TORCH 
RELAY HAS RAPIDLY TURNED INTO 
MASS DEMONSTRATION AGAINST CHINA'S 
HUMAN RIGHT RECORDS WITH SCENES OF 
PROTEST BROADCAST AROUND THE WORLD 
THE MAN BEHIND CHARIOTS OF FIRE 
SPOKE TO US HE PRODUCED THE MOST 
INSPIRATIONAL OF OLYMPIC FILM OF 
ALL TIME A MEMORY OF DAYS WHEN THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH WAS CHEERED EVERY 
WHERE WHERE BUT THE DEMONSTRATIONS AROUND THE 
BEIJING OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY COULD 
NOT HAVE BEEN FURTHER FROM THE MOOD 
OF CHARIOTS OF FIRE SO IS THIS 
GLOBAL RELAY JUST A HUGE MISTAKE 
DAVID PUTIN THINKS SO 
I THINK IT 
WAS A CLUMSY IDEA 
ONE OF THOSE IDEA DAVID PUTTNAM 
THINKS SO 
PUTTNAM BELIEVES THE SCENES COULD 
BE POSITIVE IN THE LONG RUN THE THE CRITICISM IT IS GETTING WILL BE 
HEALTHY FOR IT IF IT RESPONDS AND 
REACTS IF IT GOES INTO ITS SHELLS 
DECIDES IT IS NOT INTERESTED IN 
CRITICISM THEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM 
BELIEVE ME BY THE END OF AUGUST 
THIS YEAR CHINA WILL WE WILL KNOW 
MORE ABOUT CHINA CHINA WILL KNOW 
MORE ABOUT US THAN IT HAS TODAY 
HIS SOLUTION FOR TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IS SO TAKE 
THIS TORCH FROM THE NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT GAMES AND 
RUN IT AROUND BRITAIN NOT THE REST 
OF THE WORLD 
SIMPLY BECAUSE I 
THINK IT WILL BE MORE EFFECTIVE IF 
EVERYBODY IN BRITAIN HAD A CHANCE 
TO SEE IT AS OPPOSED TO PEOPLE IN 
OTHER COUNTRIES 
THE SAFEST WAY OF 
SHOWING OFF LONDON'S GAMES IS TO 
KEEP THE TORCH AT HOME 
WE DON'T 
HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION FOR SOME 
TIME LONG AFTER THE DUST HAS 
SETTLED ON THIS BEIJING TORCH RELAY 
SO YOU KNOW OUR MAJOR OBJECTIVE 
APART FROM HOSTING THE BEST GAMES 
EVER IS TO MAKE SURE THE WHOLE OF 
THE U. K. FEELS INVOLVED 
MAYBE LONDON 
SHOULD LISTEN TO AN OSCAR WINNER 
WHEN IT COMES TO PUTTING ON THE 
WORLD'S BIGGEST SPORTING SHOW 
AND ADRIAN IS HERE BEFORE WE THINK 
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TWELVE HAVE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTS 
THAT THE BEIJING TORCH MAY RETURN 
TO LONDON THIS YEAR TO MARK THE 
PARALYMPICS 
THERE HAS BEEN TALK OF PARALYMPICS A SMALLER CEREMONY L. MENTIONED IT 
TO TESSA JOWELL SHE SAID IT IS THE 
FIRST SHE HEARD OF IT 
IN LIGHT OF 
THE PRO TIBET PROTESTS WE SAW IN 
LONDON AND AROUND THE WORLD THE I. O. C. 
WILL NOT WANT ANOTHER REPEAT OF 
THAT WILL THEY 
EXACTLY THE I. O. C. 
LIKE TO KEEP THE HOST CITY ON A 
TIGHT LEAD WATCH WHAT IT IS DOING 
CHINA IS LIKE A DOG PULLING AWAY 
ITS OWNER THEY HAVE LOST CONTROL 
HERE PEOPLE IN THE OLYMPIC 
MOVEMENT ARE SAYING TO ME LOOK 
WHAT THE I. O. C. LEADERSHIP HAS TO DO 
NOW IS SAY LOOK WE RUN THE SHOW 
WE WILL TAKE CONTROL 
THEY WILL 
DECIDE WHETHER IT COMES TO LONDON 
AGAIN 
IT IS COMPLICATED IN TERMS AGAIN OF IF IT THE PARALYMPIC ASSOCIATION 
THEY WILL SAY WE DON'T WANT A 
REPEAT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN LONDON 
BEFORE BEFORE THANK YOU 
TO FOOTBALL NOW AND ARSENAL'S 
HOPES OF OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
TITLE FELL BY THE WAY SIDE LAST 
NIGHT IT IS DOWN TO CHELSEA TO 
KEEP LONDON HOPES ALIVE THE BLUES 
FACE MANCHESTER UNITED AT THE END 
OF THE MONTH THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF 
IMPORTANT GAMES BEFORE THAT 
STARTING TONIGHT AGAINST WIGAN 
IS IT A MUST WIN TONIGHT 
ABSOLUTELY CHELSEA CURRENTLY SIX 
POINTS BEHIND MANCHESTER UNITED IN 
THE TABLE THEY MUST KEEP THE 
PRESSURE ON TO MAKE IT COUNT WHEN 
UNITED COME HERE ON TWENTY SIXTH JOINING 
ME IS A FORMER CHELSEA WINGER 
WIGAN SHOULD BE STRAIGHTFORWARD I I GUESS IT SHOULD BE YOU CAN NEVER 
TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED AS WE 
HAVE SEEN IN THE SEASON IT HAS TO 
BE A TOUGH GAME THEY HAVE TO START 
QUICKLY AND GET THE THREE POINTS TO 
KEEP THE PRESSURE ON 
EVERYBODY HAS 
BEENING TALKING ABOUT STYLE OF PLAY 
HAVING A GO AT GRANT SAYING WE ARE 
NOT SURE ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP 
WITH PLAYERS HE GETS RESULTS ANY ANY MANAGER WOULD HAVE A TOUGH TASK 
YOU WILL GET CRITICISMS UNLESS YOU 
WIN THINGS OF COURSE THINGS WERE 
WON WITH THE OTHER MANAGER WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE STYLE OF PLAY DOES IT 
MATTER YOU WANT THE THREE POINTS 
AS THEY DIDN'T WIN THE CARLING CUP 
FINAL THE FANS LOOK TOWARDS 
WINNING SOMETHING THAT IS 
ESSENTIAL IT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE 
LAST COUPLE OF SEASONS IT HAS TO 
CONTINUE OF COURSE YOU LOOK AT 
ARSENAL HAVING NOT WON ANYTHING IN 
THE PAST FOUR YEARS OF COURSE IT 
IS IMPORTANT STYLE OF PLAY I 
THINK AT THIS STAGE OF THE SEASON 
NOT REALLY I THINK IT IS ABOUT 
PUTTING TROPHIES ON THE TABLE 
EVERTON ON THURSDAY ALL BUILDING 
UP TO THAT MANCHESTER UNITED GAME 
OF COURSE THREE POINTS WOULD BE 
NICE IF THEY CAN GET THREE POINTS 
THERE IT IS A MASSIVE BUILD UP TO 
THE GAME NEXT WEEK THEY COULD GO 
ON AND WIN THAT AS WELL 
THANK YOU HOPEFULLY LATER ON WE 
WILL FIND OUT IF THERE IS A LONDON 
CLUB STILL IN THE HOPE OF GETTING 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP THANK YOU 
NOW RESIDENTS SAY IT S. P. POINTLESS 
AND A WASTE OF MONEY THE LOCAL 
COUNCIL SAYS IT IS PRESERVING 
HERITAGE THE ISSUE EALINGS 
ANTIQUE LAMPPOSTS WHICH HAVE STOOD 
FOR MORE THAN CENTURY WILL BE 
PULLED OUT OF THE GROUND AND 
REPLACED WITH FAKES 
IT IS NOT A POPULAR DECISION WITH 
THOSE LIVING NEARBY HOW MANY 
CONTRACTORS 
DOES 
IT TAKE TO CHANGE 
CONTRACTORS DOES IT TAKE TO CHANGE A LAMPPOST 
BEHAVE YOURSELF YOU L. 
WILL BE UP THERE 
HOW MANY 
PROTESTERS DOES IT SEE TO SEE THEM 
OFF THERE WERE SEVERAL WORKMEN IN 
HANWELL VILLAGE THEY CAME TO 
REPLACE LAMPPOSTS IT WAS NEVER 
GOING TO BE EASY 
THEY STAND WHERE 
WE WANT TO DIG YOU CANNOT DIG 
SOME OF THOSE LAMPPOSTS HAVE BEEN 
HERE NOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS THERE IS 
NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM THEY ARE 
ALL IN WORKING ORDER EALING 
COUNCIL IS PLANNING TO REPLACE 
THESE WITH FAKE ANTIQUE LAMPPOSTS 
ALL THESE WILL BE SHIFTED AND THEY 
WILL END UP HERE ABOUT MILE OR SO 
DOWN THE ROAD THIS IS EALING'S NEW 
HERITAGE QUARTER THE COUNCIL IS 
TRYING TO BUMP UP THE STATUS OF 
THIS AREA THE VILLAGERS OF HANWELL 
BELIEVE IT IS AT THEIR EXEXPENSE 
THEY KNOW IF WE WERE CONSULTED 
THERE WOULD BE AN OUTCRY 
THIS IS 
WHAT THE NEW POSTS LOOK LIKE THEY 
HAVE BEEN PUT UP IN SOME ROADS IN 
THIS CONSERVATION AREA LOCALS MAY 
NOT LIKE THEM THE COUNCIL RECKON 
IT IS ALL FOR THE GREATER GOOD 
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THIS LIGHTING 
HAVE AN AREA TO THIS IS SOMEWHERE 
WE CAN SAY SOMETHING ABOUT OUR 
HISTORY THESE THREE LAMPPOSTS WILL 
STAY OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE'S OLD 
TRAIN STATION THERE MAY BE SOME 
LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL BUT 
IT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO PLEASE 
THIS LOT
