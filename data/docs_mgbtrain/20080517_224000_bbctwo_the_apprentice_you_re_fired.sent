YOUR PRIZE IS WORKING WITH ME YOU'RE FIRED 
YOU'RE FIRED NO GOOD 
SAME OLD STORY YOU'RE FIRED GOODBYE 
THE SECOND THE SECOND IL ILII THE SECOND 
GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO THE APPRENTICE YOU'RE FIRED 
AS EVER WE'RE HERE TO PICK OVER THE BONES OF WHAT WENT WRONG 
WITH OUR PANEL AND SOME UNSEEN FOOTAGE 
WE'LL BE LOOKING AT HOW SELLING CAKES AT A WEDDING FAIR 
DIDN'T LEAVE SARA WITH ANYTHING TO CELEBRATE 
AND WE'LL BE REFLECTING ON A DRAMATIC CHANGE OF SARTORIAL TACK BY THE USUALLY IMMACULATE RAEF 
LET ME JUST PRACTISE A FEW MOVES 
ON OUR PANEL RETAIL EXPERT MARY PORTAS APPRENTICE FAN AND MAGAZINE EDITOR MARK FRITH 
AND JOURNALIST JANE MOORE 
I DON'T KNOW IF OR WHEN SARA WILL GET MARRIED 
BUT I DO HOPE THAT THE SIGHT OF THE WEDDING CAKE DOESN'T ENTIRELY SPOIL HER DAY 
ONE THING I AM SURE WHO IS GOING RIGHT NOW 
SARA YOU'RE FIRED O. K. 
THANK YOU 
PLEASE WELCOME SARA DHADA 
SO HAS YOUR APPETITE FOR CAKE DIMINISHED SINCE THAT TASK 
IT HAS REALLY I HAVE NOT HAD CAKE SINCE THEN 
IT REALLY PUTS ME OFF 
YOU'VE JUST SEEN THE PROGRAMME ANY THOUGHTS 
IT SEEMED SIR ALAN DEFINITELY WANTED TO FIRE ME AT THE END 
AND I WAS PRETTY SHOCKED 
COS I THOUGHT HELENE WAS GOING TO GO SO I WAS PRETTY SHOCKED 
WE'VE GONE BACK INTO OUR ARCHIVE AND LOOKED AT YOUR AUDITION TAPE 
YOU BEAT TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE TO GET TO BE ONE OF THE FINAL CANDIDATES 
DO YOU RECALL SAYING THIS 
I CAN BELIEVE IN ANYTHING 
I CAN GAIN INFORMATION ON A PRODUCT AND SELL IT LIKE HOT CAKES 
NO MATTER WHAT THE PRODUCT IS I CAN SELL ANYTHING TO ANYBODY 
SO IF THOSE CAKES HAD BEEN HOT 
I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SELL THEM YEAH 
LET'S LOOK AT WHERE IT WENT WRONG 
IF I CAN INTERRUPT WITHOUT BEING RUDE 
DO YOU LIKE THE TASTE OF IT OBVIOUSLY IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE TODAY 
YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO TRANSMIT BUT NOT RECEIVE 
I NEED TO SPEAK TO THE GROOM I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO JUST ORDER IT 
IS THERE SOMETHING LIKE WHERE YOU CAN PAY THE DEPOSIT 
THIS IS THE COMPANY I LIKE TO ORDER FROM BECAUSE I LIKE THE TASTE 
AND TAKE THE GROOM AS TO THE FINAL TOUCHES 
THE SALES APPROACH WAS WRONG YOU'RE NOT SELLING DOUBLE GLAZING 
I KNOW I'M GOING FOR THE HARD SELL BUT I DON'T CARE AT THIS POINT 
I JUST WANT A BLOODY SALE 
O. K. THAT'S FINE THANK YOU 
FUCK 
IF I HAD BEEN ONE OF THE RECIPIENTS OF YOUR SALES PITCH 
IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE WHAT YOU ARE DOING NOW 
I WOULD HAVE GOT HOLD OF YOUR HEAD AND PUSHED IT IN THE BLOODY CAKE 
YOU MUST HAVE REALISED IT WAS GOING TO BE TOUGH IN THE BOARDROOM 
HE WAS THREATENING PHYSICAL VIOLENCE 
I DID AT THAT POINT ONE THOUGHT I'D BETTER SHUT UP 
BECAUSE I AM GOING ON A BIT AND I JUST NEED TO RELAX AND CALM DOWN 
AS A RETAIL EXPERT WHERE DO YOU THINK SARA WENT WRONG 
IT WAS THE HARD SELL BEYOND 
IT'S YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE IN ANY SHOP 
WHEN SOMEBODY GETS YOU BY THE THROAT AND HAS YOU AGAINST A WALL 
THE DESPERATION IN YOUR EYES I KNOW BUT THE TRUTH WAS 
IT WAS A DESPERATE TASK THE CAKES WERE THE SAME PRICE AS THE FROCKS 
YES I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE SAYING THE CAKE COST THE SAME AS THE DRESS 
I THINK YOU WERE IN A ROAD TO NOWHERE FROM DAY ONE ON THAT BABY 
I AGREE THE PRODUCT SELECTION WAS DEFINITELY WRONG 
FROM THE START WHEN WE WERE IN THIS TASK 
WHEN WE GOT TO THE N. E. C. I JUST KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT 
AND AS YOU SAID DESPERATION 
FROM FOUR O'CLOCK I THOUGHT IF WE DON'T SELL ANY CAKES 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO WIN IT WAS LIKE SOMEONE PLEASE BUY A CAKE 
NO ONE DID JANE WOULD YOU HAVE BOUGHT A CAKE FROM THEM 
NO I ABSOLUTELY WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T BUY ANYTHING FROM ANY OF THEM 
THE PRODUCT CHOICE WAS COMPLETELY WRONG 
AT A WEDDING SHOW FIRST AND FOREMOST MEN DON'T GO 
IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO GET THEM TO THE SHOPS A WEDDING SHOW FORGET IT 
AND THE ONE THING THAT WOMEN BUY INDEPENDENTLY IS THE DRESS 
YOU DON'T COLLABORATE AT ALL 
WE DO HAVE TO HAVE SOME PRETENCE OF COLLABORATION ON THE REST 
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE REALLY 
TO BE HONEST NO TAKE OR LEAVE THAT 
YOU DO HAVE TO PRETEND TO COLLABORATE ON CAKE FOR EXAMPLE 
AND I FELT REALLY SORRY FOR THAT POOR WOMAN WHO WAS BULLIED 
INTO RINGING HER BOYFRIEND AND WAS THEN TOLD IT WAS COMPLETELY DULL 
AND SHE WAS SO CRESTFALLEN SHE'D JUST BEEN TOLD 
THAT EVERYTHING SHE WAS GOING TO DO FOR HER WEDDING WAS DULL 
TO BE FAIR THAT WAS MICHAEL WHO WAS DOING THAT 
I HAVE TO SAY SARA AT THE END OF ALL THIS 
I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE BIGGEST HUG BECAUSE AS THE SERIES HAS GONE ON 
I THINK YOU'VE BEEN BULLIED BY SOME OF THE OTHER CONTESTANTS 
ILIIIIIILIIIIILI THE SECOND I IIILIIIIIII IIILIII THE SECOND THE SECOND IL ILIIIII 
THEY'RE NOT APPLAUDING THE BULLYING BY THE WAY 
WE'VE SEEN YOUR CONFIDENCE EBB AWAY WEEK BY WEEK SO MUCH SO THAT 
WHEN ALEX SAID THE PERSON WHO SOLD THE LEAST SHOULD GO 
YOU AND MICHAEL HAD SOLD THE LEAST 
YOU IMMEDIATELY SAID THAT WILL BE ME THEN IT WASN'T YOU AT ALL NO 
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT 
YOU GOT YOUR ENERGY BACK UP YOURSELF IN THE MARRAKESH TASK 
I REALLY FEEL FOR YOU THANK YOU 
I WAS ASTONISHED COS YOU'RE CLEARLY VERY BRIGHT YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL 
THANK YOU AND YOU'RE A BARRISTER AT THE ONE POINT HE COULD HAVE FIRED 
ANY ONE OF THOSE THREE AND YOU JUST DIDN'T DEFEND YOURSELF I DIDN'T 
ON THAT BASIS IF I'D PARKED ON A DOUBLE YELLOW LINE YOU'D GET ME A LIFE SENTENCE 
I THINK I DID YOU KNOW 
IT WAS BORDERING SUICIDE I WAS ATTACKING MY FELLOW CONTESTANTS 
AS OPPOSED TO DEFENDING MYSELF I THINK I WAS JUST REALLY STRESSED OUT 
I'VE LEARNT THAT YOU NEED TO RELAX SOMETIMES LET GO AND THINK PROPERLY 
AT THE TIME WHEN IT WAS IMPORTANT I TOTALLY MESSED IT UP 
JANE JUST PAID LAVISH TRIBUTE TO YOU YOU'RE INTELLIGENT NICE LOOKING 
RATHER DEMURE AND SOFTLY SPOKEN WHAT ON EARTH HAD THEY DONE TO YOU 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS I KNOW 
YOUR VOICE IS SO SHRILL YOU SOUND LIKE A FLIPPING MANIAC I KNOW I DO 
HIGH PITCHED I CAN'T STAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE ATTITUDE 
THOSE THAT TALK OVER ME AND THOSE THAT DON'T LISTEN TO ME 
YOUR THROAT MUST HAVE BEEN KILLING YOU 
PEOPLE WERE CALLING ME SAYING SARA YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE THAT WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOUR VOICE 
THAT'S NOT ME I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED I JUST SOUND DRUNK AWFUL 
THERE WERE TWO VERY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES FOR THE TEAMS 
WE'LL DISCUSS THEM SHORTLY LET'S REMIND OURSELVES OF THEM 
DO YOU THINK IT MAKES SENSE THAT WHEN WE SPLIT INTO TEAMS 
ONE GOES TO THE WEDDING DRESS SHOPS 
AND THE OTHER TEAM DOES THE OTHER SERVICES 
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE INFORMATION ACROSS THE DRESSES 
CENTRAL LONDON'S NEAR NORTH LONDON SO ONE FACTION OF THE TEAM 
SHOULD GO TO CENTRAL AND NORTH LONDON AND THE OTHER TO SOUTH LONDON 
THAT WAS CLEARLY A MISTAKE SPLITTING THE TEAM 
THIS MICHAEL IT'S BEYOND ME WATCHING HIM 
HE IS CLEVER HE DID SAY CENTRAL LONDON IS NEAR NORTH LONDON 
IT ISN'T INACCURATE HE IS BRILLIANT BUT WHEN YOU'RE BUYING 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT COLLECTIONS 
SO TWO SEPARATE TEAMS DOING THAT WAS JUST RIDICULOUS FROM THE START 
THAT'S WHERE WE WENT WRONG ONE TEAM SHOULD HAVE LOOKED AT ALL THE DRESSES 
SO WE COULD HAVE MADE AN INFORMED DECISION 
AND ONE FOR THE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT'S WHERE WE WENT WRONG JANE 
THE KILLER LINE WHICH MADE ME KNOW THEY WERE GOING THE WRONG WAY 
WAS THIS IS A WEDDING DRESS SO YOU'LL LOOK LIKE JODIE MARSH 
ON YOUR WEDDING DAY I'D RATHER LOOK LIKE RODNEY MARSH 
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ME RUN FOR THE HILLS 
WHAT WERE THEY THINKING IT WAS SO NICHE THAT MARKET 
I KNOW WHEN I SAW THOSE DRESSES I THOUGHT OH MY GOD 
HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET RID OF THEM THEY'RE AWFUL 
WHAT WAS HELENE THINKING 
LET'S GO BACK TO MICHAEL IN TERMS OF SPLITTING THE TEAMS 
HE SAID CENTRAL LONDON NORTH LONDON SPLIT IT GEOGRAPHICALLY 
BUT HE WAS SINGING A DIFFERENT TUNE BY THE END 
AN INTELLIGENT PERSON WOULD HAVE SENT TWO PEOPLE TO LOOK AT DRESSES 
AND TWO PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THE OTHER STUFF 
COS THEN THEY COULD MAKE AN ACTUAL OVERALL OPINION 
I ASKED MICHAEL WHY HE DIDN'T RAISE THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TASK 
BUT HE SAID THE OPPOSITE FROM WHAT I COULD SEE 
YES FOR HIM IT WAS A GEOGRAPHICAL THING NOT THE LOGICAL WAY HE'S PRETENDING IT IS THERE 
HE'S SAID THE OPPOSITE ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
AND HE SLIME BALLS HIS WAY OUT OF IT BEYOND BEYOND 
THERE IS A SKILL IN THAT THERE'S A JOB FOR HIM SOMEWHERE IT JUST BORES EVERYONE 
I LIKE GO ON 
HE JUST BORES EVERYONE INTO SUBMISSION 
BECAUSE HE TALKS SLOWLY AND MONOTONOUSLY THE WHOLE TIME 
YOU SAID HE SLIME BALLED HIS WAY OUT OF IT 
I LIKE THE USE OF THE WORD SLIME BALL AS A VERB 
I LIKE THAT IF THE SHOE FITS IT WEAR IT IN MICHAEL'S CASE 
HOW DID HE GET OUT OF THIS ONE 
OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WE'LL BE LIAISING WITH YOU 
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT FOR THE FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS THE CAKE EVERYTHING 
THE SALES TECHNIQUE WAS PRESSURISING BECAUSE HE WAS TOO PUSHY FOR ME 
THESE PEOPLE ARE DUM DUMS THAT'S WHY 
THEY'RE DUM DUMS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE TIMES I CAN LISTEN TO THAT NONSENSE 
PLEASE I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE I'M BEGGING BUT IF YOU CAN GIVE ME 
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO BE A PROJECT MANAGER SHOW YOU WHAT I CAN DO 
I HAVE MORE TO GIVE THAN JUST BEING A SALESMAN I REALLY DO 
GET BACK TO THE HOUSE THE PAIR OF YOU 
THAT MICHAEL HE WAS GONE I DON'T KNOW 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME IN THIS BOARDROOM THAT SOMEONE'S CHANGED MY MIND 
TALK ABOUT A CAT WITH NINE LIVES 
DID HE SAY A CAT WITH NINE LIVES HERE'S A CAT 
THE QUESTION IS IF A CAT LOOKED LIKE THIS 
AND STEPPED IN FRONT OF YOUR CAR WOULD YOU SLOW DOWN OR SPEED UP 
THAT IS THE QUESTION 
HE'S VERY DIFFICULT TO LOVE ISN'T IT 
HE IS AND ESPECIALLY SO IN THIS ONE 
BECAUSE HE WAS PUSHING HIMSELF FORWARD AND LEFT HIMSELF OPEN 
HE SHOULD HAVE GONE HE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD HAVE GONE 
BUT I ALSO THINK THERE WAS A REASON FOR HELENE TO GO AS WELL 
ON MICHAEL HOW DID HE ESCAPE NOBODY DOES THAT TO SIR ALAN 
NOBODY BEGS HE DEFENDED HIMSELF WHICH IS WHAT I WAS SAYING TO SARA 
THE PUPPY DOG EYES AND THAT LITTLE EXPRESSION LIKE THAT 
AND PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE 
HE DEFENDED HIMSELF AND HE FOUGHT FOR SURVIVAL 
HE WAS ON A WARNING FROM LAST WEEK 
AND YOU ONLY PLAY THAT CARD ONCE SURELY 
HIS CARDS WERE MARKED WITH THE WHOLE KOSHER CHICKEN THING ALSO 
SIR ALAN SAYS AT THE BEGINNING I WON'T FALL FOR PITY STORIES 
IT WILL NOT WORK WITH ME SO THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE 
MAYBE HE JUST SEES SOME OF HIMSELF IN MICHAEL MAYBE THERE IS SOME SPIRIT 
SOMETHING HE JUST SEES THAT WE NOT ANY OF US ARE SEEING 
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT WHY WOULD YOU KEEP THIS GUY 
I HAVE NO IDEA HE DOESN'T EVEN SOUND INTELLIGENT 
HE'S JUST USELESS AND HE'S NOT THAT CANNY 
WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON HIM BEYOND USELESS ANY OTHER WORDS 
I DON'T WANT TO SAY HERE BUT 
GO ON WHERE ELSE YOU GONNA DO IT 
I IIIII IIIL I IIIII IIIL 
I WAS JUST GONNA SAY I DON'T KNOW HIS WAY OF THINKING 
HE'S IRRITATING AND HE JUST USES THE BOARDROOM AS A DRAMA 
HE IS INTO DRAMA AND HE USES IT AS A STAGE AND ALL THIS PASSION COMES OUT 
AND IT'S LIKE WHERE WAS THAT ON THE TASK 
THAT'S INTERESTING BUT HE IS GREASY 
GREASY MAY BE THE BEST WORD GREASY AS THE BUTTER USED IN THOSE CAKES 
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY I GET THAT THIS IS LIGHT WHICH I LOVE 
BUT IT HAS A RICH QUALITY WHICH IS ESSENTIAL 
I CAN FAKE PASSION ABOUT EVERYTHING WHETHER IT'S A WOMAN 
A PIECE OF FOOD WHATEVER AND PULL IT OFF WITH EFFORTLESS CHARM 
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND SYCOPHANTIC 
BUT GOOD FOR YOU TO HAVE THE BALLS TO COME UP WITH SUCH AN AMAZING INNOVATIVE LINE I LOVE IT 
SOME OF THEM WERE GHASTLY 
WHY WOULD ONE WANT TO WEAR SUCH A THING A GARMENT 
HOPEFULLY THAT DIDN'T COME ACROSS 
I WOULD BE PROUD TO HAVE THEM REPRESENT ME ESPECIALLY MICHAEL 
THE THING IS I AM A COMPLETE ARSE LICKER 
YEAH YOU ARE 
SO I'LL BE GOOD AT THAT 
BASICALLY IF THERE WAS ONE WORD TO DESCRIBE YOU ARSE LICKER 
HE DOESN'T LACK SELF AWARENESS HE IS HONEST ABOUT HIMSELF 
HE DOES BELIEVE IN HIS OWN PUBLICITY 
THE THOUGHT OF HIM FAKING PASSION FOR A WOMAN IS JUST TOO MUCH 
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN ALL THE OTHER BITS AND IT'S NOT GOOD 
HE'S GOING TO COME A CROPPER THAT BOY POSSIBLY NEXT WEEK 
I THINK HE CALLS OUT HIS OWN NAME DURING SEX 
IL ILIII IIILII'IIIII 
BACK TO YOU SARA 
LET'S HEAR WHAT THE BOSS AND YOUR SO CALLED FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY ABOUT YOU 
SHE LIKES TO MOAN AND BLAME OTHER PEOPLE AND ALWAYS FEELS 
THAT SHE'S BEING DONE DOWN 
TO SAY THAT THE PERSON WHO DIDN'T CLOSE THE DEAL 
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE OF THE TASK I FIND HIGHLY UNFAIR 
SARA IS INEXPERIENCED SHE'S COME FROM A LEGAL BACKGROUND 
AND FAMILY BUSINESSES AND IT GIVES YOU A SMALL PICTURE OF THE WORLD 
YOU LIKE THE TASTE WHAT'S STOPPING YOU 
THE WAY SHE APPROACHED THE SALE WAS TOO HARD NOSED AND FORCEFUL 
SHE USED THE SLEDGE HAMMER APPROACH TO SELL CAKES 
WHEREAS SHE SHOULD HAVE USED A SOFTLY SOFTLY APPROACH 
SHE DOESN'T STOP MOANING AND COMPLAINING 
AND SHE THINKS EVERYBODY'S AGAINST HER 
I DON'T NEED THAT TYPE OF PERSON IN MY ORGANISATION 
THAT'S WHY I FIRED SARA 
WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS 
HARSH THAT WAS PRETTY HARSH 
I THINK THE MAIN ISSUE WAS I WAS TOO DEFENSIVE 
I NEED TO LEARN FROM THAT 
I WAS JUST ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK IN THE BOARDROOM 
AND SIR ALAN PICKED UP ON THAT I THINK THAT'S WHERE HIS VIEWS CAME FROM 
YOU ATTACKED OTHERS INSTEAD OF DEFENDING YOURSELF 
YES I DID NOT SAY I'VE WORKED REALLY HARD THIS IS WHAT I'M ABOUT 
I DID NOT DO THAT THAT WAS MY ONE OPPORTUNITY AND I MESSED THAT UP 
I THINK THAT'S WHERE HIS VIEWS CAME FROM 
SO YOU NEED TO BE MORE POSITIVE 
OF COURSE I NEED TO BE MORE POSITIVE AND LEARN HOW TO DEFEND MYSELF 
THE WAY YOU ARE HERE AND THE POINTS YOU'RE MAKING NOW 
IF YOU HAD BEEN LIKE THAT THERE YOU'D STILL BE IN THE COMPETITION 
YES IF IT IS ABOUT TEAM PLAYING YOUR PROJECT MANAGER HELENE 
GOT OFF TO A VERY UNPROMISING START WITH THIS STATEMENT 
IN LIFE I WOULD JUST NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THESE PEOPLE 
IN BUSINESS I WOULD FIRE THESE PEOPLE 
SO I'M THROWN INTO A SITUATION WHERE I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT 
AND I'VE FOUND IT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT 
SHE DOESN'T LIKE THEM PERSONALLY AND DOESN'T THINK THEY'RE GOOD BUSINESS WISE 
WHERE'S SHE GONNA GO WITH THAT DOES THAT COME ACROSS 
HELENE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH BUSINESS ACUMEN IN MY OPINION 
SHE DIDN'T SHOW IT ON THIS TASK SHE WASN'T A GOOD PROJECT MANAGER 
SHE JUST FLOATED AROUND IN A WEDDING DRESS AND MOAN ABOUT EVERYBODY 
SHE'S A FINE LOOKING WOMAN BUT THERE'S AN AIR OF MENACE ABOUT HER I WOULDN'T FIGHT HER 
I FOUND HER TO BE QUITE SCARY TO BE HONEST 
I DIDN'T WANT TO CONFRONT HER BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT'D END UP 
THAT SCARY EYE LOOK THAT SHE GIVES YOU SARA I'M SPEAKING 
SHE NEVER LIKED YOU DID SHE 
NO AND THAT CLOUDED EVERYTHING 
FOR HER TO MANAGE YOU AT THIS TIME IN THE SERIES I THINK WAS A REAL SHAME 
THE OTHER PERSON HELENE DIDN'T LIKE WAS LUCINDA 
BUT SHE'S GAINING IN STRENGTH AT AN ALARMING RATE 
HERE SHE IS TAKING ON SOMEONE YOU'D NEVER THINK LUCINDA COULD TAKE ON THE FABULOUS LEE MCQUEEN 
THE FREE RANGE ORGANIC EGGS MEANS NOT CAGED ABSOLUTELY 
WHAT'S THE LEAD TIME WITH THIS WHAT DO YOU THINK 
SOME OF THESE THINGS MAY BE EASIER WHEN WE'RE SITTING DOWN DO YOU MIND 
FINE WE COULD GET A WHOLE CONSOLIDATED LISTING 
SOMETIMES WHEN I WAS SPEAKING YOU WERE JUMPING OFF ONTO A DIFFERENT TOPIC 
AND I WAS GOING WHERE'S THAT FROM I DISAGREE I TAKE YOUR POINT 
YOU'RE THE BOSS NO NO 
I WOULDN'T UNDERMINE YOU AND I'M SURE YOU WOULDN'T ME BUT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER 
HE'S MAGNIFICENT ISN'T HE HE TOOK THE PUT DOWN WELL 
HE DIDN'T SPIT THE DUMMY DIDN'T DO A MICHAEL SOPHOCLES JUST TOOK IT 
YOU SAW THAT THIS WAS A GOOD TEAM AND THAT THIS WAS A TEAM THAT COULD WIN 
NORMALLY HE WOULD PROBABLY ANSWER BACK 
HE THOUGHT HE'D LISTEN TO HER BECAUSE SHE'S HAD A GOOD FEW WEEKS 
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE'D BE THIS GOOD AT SELLING THIS STUFF 
HE WAS FANTASTIC AT SELLING THONGS 
BUT IF YOU PUT THE WHOLE PARADE OF CANDIDATES IN FRONT OF YOU 
AND PICKED WHO WOULD SELL THONGS HE'D BE LAST I'D PICK A WOMAN 
HE WAS BRILLIANT AT IT ESPECIALLY DOING THE UNDERSIZING GENIUS 
LET'S STAND BACK AND ADMIRE LEE MCQUEEN 
HELLO LADIES 
LEE WASN'T INITIALLY COMFORTABLE SELLING THONGS HOWEVER HE'S BEING VERY SMOOTH 
AND SEEMED TO BE ENJOYING IT IN HIS OWN WORDS HE'S LOVING IT 
WHO'S THE LUCKY LADY GETTING MARRIED 
AH YOU'VE COME TO SEE THE RIGHT MAN 
HE'S A SMOOTH OPERATOR 
I HAVE TO ASK YOU WHAT SIZE YOU ARE 
IN THONGS 
WE'RE SELLING BIKINIS WHICH IS FINE FLIP FLOPS FINE 
THEN WE GET TO BRIEFS AND PANTIES AND IT'S UM 
I HAVE TO ASK PEOPLE'S SIZES I'M GUESSING THEIR SIZE 
AND I'M ALWAYS GUESSING LOWER THAN I THINK 
WHAT SIZE EIGHT GO ON THEN I'LL HAVE A TWELVE PLEASE 
YOU CAN SEE I'M BUZZING I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT IT 
LET'S SELL SOME MORE KNICKERS 
HE DID A GREAT JOB AND JUDGING BY THE LOOK ON HER FACE 
I THINK HE SOLD ONE TO MARGARET 
IL ILIII IIILII'IIIII 
DO YOU FEEL YOU'RE NOW THE EXPERT ON THAT 
ON HOW TO SELL A LADY A THONG 
ER YES 
IL ILIII IIILII'IIIII IIILIII THE SECOND THE SECOND IL ILII THE SECOND 
I THINK WE KNOW WHAT MARGARET'S WEARING THEN 
THERE'S A THOUGHT 
SO ON LEE MCQUEEN IF YOU CAN FOCUS YOUR MINDS ON THAT 
RATHER THAN MARGARET'S UNDERWEAR 
DO YOU SHARE MY ADMIRATION FOR HIM 
I DO I THINK HE'S GROWN BRILLIANTLY 
IN EARLIER SHOWS HE WAS A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE AND BARROW BOYISH 
BUT HE'S USED THIS WONDERFUL CHARM 
I THINK HE'S GOT A GREAT CHARM 
HE'S GOT GREAT ENERGY AND HAS CLEVERLY LEARNT TO WORK WITH THE TEAM LEADER 
LUCINDA IS A BIT LIKE THAT BATTY AUNT RUNNING A CHARITY STALL 
AND HE KIND OF KNOWS HOW TO MAKE HER FEEL FABULOUS 
THE TWO WORK SO WELL TOGETHER CLEVER GUY I THINK 
LEE'S IN FOR THE RUNNING I THINK 
YES HE'S A DEFINITE DARK HORSE I THINK HE'S BRILLIANT 
AND HE HAS THAT BARROW BOY CHARM BUT HE CAN TAKE ORDERS 
AS WE SAW WHEN LUCINDA HE TAKES ORDERS VERY WELL 
AND HE WAS ALSO A REALLY GOOD TEAM LEADER 
HE'S TICKING ALL THE BOXES JUST NOW 
LAST TIME YOU CAME ON YOU WERE STILL AT HEAT AND SAID ALL THE GIRLS LIKE THE CUT OF ALEX'S JIB 
HAS LEE TAKEN OVER YET NOT QUITE YET 
THEY CERTAINLY LIKE LEE 
MY ISSUE WITH HIM IS WHETHER HIS TEMPER RE EMERGES 
IF IT DOES HE'S GOT PROBLEMS AGAIN 
THE INCIDENT TO WHICH YOU REFER IS WHEN THEY ALL GANGED UP ON YOU 
THAT NIGHT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO 
IF YOU DON'T PERFORM YOU'RE OUT SIMPLE AS THAT 
IF YOU DON'T STEP UP TO THE MARK YOU'RE GOING IN THE BOARDROOM 
A DECISION HAS BEEN MADE SIR ALAN HAS MADE IT 
WE DO NOT NEED TO FIRE QUESTIONS AT HER AS TO WHY SHE DID 
OR DIDN'T DO ANYTHING IT'S MY OPINION WHETHER I ASK A QUESTION I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD ASK THEM 
TOO MANY PEOPLE STAY QUIET I CAN EXPRESS MY OPINION HOW I LIKE 
I DON'T NEED YOUR PERMISSION 
THE WORD BULLYING HAS BEEN USED IT'S QUITE A SERIOUS ACCUSATION 
DID YOU FEEL BULLIED I FELT ATTACKED WHEN I WENT INTO THE HOUSE 
LEE STARTED IT AND HE WAS NOT EVEN ON MY TEAM 
I KEPT THINKING WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING I'M ONLY ANSWERABLE 
TO SIR ALAN WHERE ARE THESE QUESTIONS COMING FROM 
THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM 
THANK GOD RAEF WAS THERE AND LUCINDA WAS BY MY SIDE 
PEOPLE ASK WHY I DIDN'T DEFEND MYSELF AND I THOUGHT THEY HAD NO RIGHT 
TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO ANSWER 
I DIDN'T NEED TO STOOP TO THEIR LEVEL BUT IT WAS HORRIBLE 
YOU FELT UNDER ATTACK RATHER THAN BEING BULLIED 
I DID FEEL UNDER ATTACK YOU MENTIONED RAEF WE HAD SOME SOUND DIETARY ADVICE FROM HIM 
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THOSE PEOPLE IN A SIZE SIXTEEN THIRTY TWO DRESS AND SIZE SIXTEEN AND THIRTY TWO FOR A REASON 
THEY LOVE CAKE 
HE'S JUST POSH TO HIS VERY CORE SOME PEOPLE JUST DRESS POSH SOME PEOPLE HAVE POSH VOICES 
WHAT'S FASCINATING IS THAT HE RUNS POSH 
HE'S IN A TERRIBLE HURRY TO GET INTO B. H. S. FOR SOME REASON HERE 
LOOK AT THE WAY HE CORNERS HE'S RUNNING LIKE A POSH BOY 
IL ILIII IIILII'IIIII 
LIKE A PREFECT CHASING HIS FAG 
THERE'S A BIT OF RHETT BUTLER ABOUT HIM IN THAT LONG COAT 
BOUNDING UP THOSE STAIRS 
NOT A HAIR OUT OF PLACE 
ABSOLUTE POETRY IN MOTION I THOUGHT 
HE DID STRUGGLE WITH THIS TASK 
YOU'D THINK AT A WEDDING FAIR HE'D HAVE HAD SIX POTENTIAL BRIDES 
AND HAVE SOLD A FORTUNE AT THE END OF THE DAY BUT NOT IN THIS CASE 
LADIES WOULD YOU LIKE TO ENTER OUR RAFFLE FOR SOME CHAMPAGNE 
RAEF WAS NOT NATURALLY AT EASE AT THE N. E. C. 
AND AT MOMENTS I THOUGHT HE LOOKED LOST 
LADIES HI CAN I INTEREST YOU IN A DRESS 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK HE DOES WHAT DOES HE DO 
PINK PANTHER THEME TUNE 
SALES ARE SALES OBVIOUSLY IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IF YOU BELIEVE 
IN A PRODUCT I'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT THOSE PANTIES AND I BELIEVE IN THEM 
THAT'S THE SCRUFFIEST HE'S EVER BEEN DRESSED IN HIS WHOLE LIFE 
IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT CAN GUARANTEE YOU TO CROSS THE ROAD 
IT'S SOMEBODY DRESSED IN A FAKE FUR COSTUME 
WHY WOULD YOU SEE A GREAT BIG FAT BEAR AND THINK OF WEDDING LINGERIE 
THE ASSOCIATION IS BEYOND ISN'T IT IT'S RIDICULOUS 
HIS NICKNAME WAS LAWRENCE OF A RAEF I. A. BUT WE'VE GOT A NEW ONE 
HE BEARS A STARTLING RESEMBLANCE TO A SUPERHERO IF YOU LOOK 
THAT'S FRIGHTENING YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER 
WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IN THE FINAL JANE 
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE LEE 
I'D WOULD LIKE TO SEE RAEF BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA MAKE IT 
COS I THINK HE'S A BIT ALL GONG AND NO DINNER 
SO I'D LIKE TO SEE LUCINDA AND LEE THE POSH TOTTY AND THE BARROW BOY 
HOW DO YOU CHOOSE BETWEEN THOSE TWO 
IT'S LIKE CHOOSING BETWEEN CHEESE AND NOT CHEESE 
PRECISELY IT'D BE GREAT BARROW BOY VERSUS POSH BOY FOR ME 
LEE VERSUS RAEF IT'S THE FINAL EVERYBODY WANTS SURELY 
YES I LOVE THE IDEA OF ANY OF THOSE 
BUT I THINK IT WILL BE RAEF BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN PROFESSIONAL THROUGHOUT 
AND HE HAS KEPT HIS COUNSEL BRILLIANTLY 
SADLY I THINK IT WILL BE CLAIRE WITH HIM 
I JUST THINK SIR ALAN LIKES HER HE DOES SOMEHOW SHE GETS AWAY WITH IT 
THERE ARE SOME VERY HIGH PROFILE APPRENTICE FANS 
ONE IS JONATHAN ROSS HERE'S HIS VIEW ON THE CANDIDATES 
MY FAVOURITE IS RAEF 
WHO INITIALLY I THOUGHT WAS THE BIGGEST COCK ON THE PLANET 
ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T COMPLETELY CHANGED MY VIEW I LOVE THE FACT 
HE'S ALWAYS DRESSED LIKE HE'S IN A CATALOGUE 
BUT IF YOU CAN'T KEEP RAEF MICHAEL SOPHOCLES CAN GO 
BECAUSE HE'S A COMPLETE AND UTTER TWAT 
COME ON COME ON 
HE'S AN AGGRESSIVE HORRIBLE LITTLE FELLER CLAIRE IS AWFUL 
WHY DOES SHE WEAR A SCARF AROUND HER FACE LIKE HER HEAD HAS BEEN CUT OFF AND SEWN BACK ON 
I THINK THERE'S A HEAD TRANSPLANT GONE ON THERE 
AND WHAT IS WRONG WITH LUCINDA SHE LOOKS LIKE A GONK WHY DOES SHE WEAR THOSE HATS 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE 
NO ONE ELSE DRESSES LIKE THAT ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH 
SO WAS THE RIGHT DECISION MADE THIS WEEK THEN JANE 
NO NO I THINK MICHAEL SHOULD HAVE GONE 
I THINK HELENE SHOULD HAVE GONE BAD TEAM ORGANISATION 
AWFUL TEAM ORGANISATION SHE CHOSE THE WRONG DRESS 
AND ALSO SHE LET HER DISLIKE OF YOU JUST GET IN THE WAY OF THINGS 
WHICH IS WRONG MARY OH MICHAEL 
THE SLIME BALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT OUT OF THE DOOR GONE 
HE'S JUST A PLONKER 
SO THREE OUT OF THREE ON YOUR SIDE SARA 
LET'S ASK THE AUDIENCE IF YOU THINK SIR ALAN WAS RIGHT TO FIRE SARA 
PLEASE HOLD UP THE RED ONE IF NOT HOLD UP THE OTHER ONE 
THAT IS PRETTY UNANIMOUS SARA THE AUDIENCE LOVED YOU 
EVEN IF SIR ALAN SAW FIT TO FIRE YOU 
LET'S GIVE HER A ROUND OF APPLAUSE
