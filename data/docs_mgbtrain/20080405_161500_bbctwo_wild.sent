AT THE VERY SOUTH WEST TIP OF IRELAND 
REACHING OUT INTO THE ATLANTIC LIES THE DINGLE PENINSULA 
THIS MYSTERIOUS AND RUGGED COAST HAS LONG BEEN HOME TO LEGENDS OF SEA MONSTERS 
ONE OF THESE TALES IS TRUE 
AT FIRST I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT WAS BUT WHEN I SEEN THE HEAD 
I RECOGNISED IT WAS A TURTLE LIKE 
THE LEATHERBACK 
A GIANT AMONG TURTLES 
IT CAN LIVE A HUNDRED YEARS AND GROW AS BIG AS A CAR 
BUT WHAT'S THIS CREATURE OF THE TROPICS DOING SO FAR NORTH 
YOU ASSOCIATE THEM WITH SOMEWHERE WARM SANDY BEACH BUT TO SEE THEM 
UP HERE OFF DINGLE IT'S JUST AMAZING 
THIS IS THE STORY OF A SEARCH TO FIND A LEATHERBACK OFF DINGLE 
AND ONE SUMMER SPENT AMONG THE EXTRAORDINARY WILDLIFE OF THESE SEAS 
IT'S AMAZING TO SEE A LEATHERBACK SEA TURTLE IN IRISH WATERS YOU KNOW 
THERE'S LEATHERBACKS OR GIANT REPTILES SWIMMING 
IN OUR WATERS IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT SO WHEN YOU DO 
SEE ONE IT IS IT'S VERY SURPRISING 
TOM DOYLE HAS COME TO DINGLE FOR THE SUMMER TO INVESTIGATE THE LEATHERBACK A LIVING DINOSAUR 
TOM AND HIS COLLEAGUE JON HOUGHTON HOPE TO TRACK DOWN ONE OF THESE ANCIENT AND ELUSIVE CREATURES 
TO HELP SOLVE THE MYSTERIES OF THEIR LIFE 
THIS ISN'T JUST ANOTHER GLOBAL WARMING STORY 
THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF LEATHERBACKS AROUND THE IRISH COAST FOR CENTURIES 
AND THEY'RE NO ACCIDENTAL TOURISTS 
IT'S A MIGRATION SO THEY MOVE FROM THE SOUTHERN TROPICAL WATERS 
TO COOLER NORTHERN TEMPERATE WATERS WHERE WE ARE UP HERE 
AND WHY THEY'RE UP HERE IS BASICALLY FOR FOOD 
IT'S QUITE SIMPLY THERE'S A LOT MORE JELLYFISH UP HERE THAN THERE ACTUALLY IS IN THE TROPICS 
SO WE KNOW THEY'RE COMING FOR THE FOOD BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY LOCATE THEIR FOOD WHAT TYPE 
OF JELLYFISH YOU'D REALLY ASSOCIATE THEM WITH IF THEY COME ACROSS 
A LOAD OF JELLYFISH HOW MANY DO THEY NEED TO EAT SO IT'D BE 
THAT KINDA REALLY SIMPLE DATA BUT VITAL DATA THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE TURTLES BETTER 
LEATHERBACKS ROAM THE INDIAN PACIFIC AND ATLANTIC OCEANS 
BUT TODAY THEY'RE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED AND COULD BECOME EXTINCT 
IN THE PACIFIC WITHIN A FEW DECADES 
THIS SUMMER TOM AND JON HAVE ONE OBJECTIVE 
TO TRACK DOWN A LEATHERBACK OFF DINGLE 
AND ATTACH A SMALL SATELLITE TAG TO MONITOR ITS MIGRATION 
THE INFORMATION THAT WE CAN GET FROM ATTACHING THIS TAG TO A TURTLE 
IS JUST VITAL AND IT CAN REALLY HELP US TO CONSERVE THIS SPECIES 
BUT FIRST TOM HAS TO FIND A LEATHERBACK 
EVEN A HUGE TURTLE IS TINY IN THE VASTNESS OF THE OCEAN 
LUCKILY THERE'S HELP AT HAND 
WE'VE BEEN COMING HERE FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING 
CLOSELY WITH THE SALMON FISHERMEN BECAUSE BASICALLY THEY'RE OUR EYES 
AND THEY OCCASIONALLY SEE LEATHERBACK SEA TURTLES 
AND OCCASIONALLY LEATHERBACK TURTLES BECOME ENTANGLED IN THEIR NETS 
IF ONE OF THESE ELUSIVE CREATURES IS CAUGHT IN A NET IT PRESENTS TOM WITH A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY 
TO ATTACH A SATELLITE TAG BEFORE RELEASING THE TURTLE UNHARMED 
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IS IF A SALMON FISHERMAN GIVES US A CALL WE GET OUT TO THE TURTLE 
AND THEN VERY QUICKLY WE ATTACH A SATELLITE TRANSMITTER ONTO THE SHELL OF THE TURTLE AND LET IT SWIM AWAY 
AT THE START IT DIDN'T MEAN MUCH TO US LIKE YOU KNOW 
HE'S A TURTLE LET HIM OFF 
BUT WHEN TOM CAME AROUND THEN AND HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE TAGGING 
AND WHERE THEY NEST AND HOW FAR THEY TRAVEL AND STUFF 
LIKE WE RESPECT THEM LIKE THE WAY THEY GO LIKE YOU KNOW SO 
WITHOUT THE SALMON FISHERMEN AND PARTICULARLY PADRAIG O'SULLIVAN 
WHO'S JUST BEEN TREMENDOUS FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
HE'S BEEN REALLY HELPING US OUT TO CARRY OUT THIS RESEARCH 
WE JUST COULDN'T DO THIS IT'S NIGH IMPOSSIBLE 
EVEN WITH PADRAIG ON BOARD TOM'S GOT HIS WORK CUT OUT 
SIGHTINGS OF LEATHERBACKS ARE VERY RARE 
EVEN THE FISHERMEN SEE JUST ONE OR TWO TURTLES EACH SUMMER 
AND THE ODDS COULD GET EVEN WORSE 
WITH SALMON STOCKS IN TROUBLE FISHING MAY BE BANNED NEXT YEAR 
SO FOR OURSELVES IT'S POSSIBLY OUR LAST CHANCE TO TAG A LEATHERBACK 
BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT THOSE FELLAS 
FOR NOW TOM HAS THE WHOLE SUMMER AHEAD OF HIM 
ON COUNTY KERRY'S BEAUTIFUL DINGLE PENINSULA 
THIS AREA THE MOST WESTERLY POINT IN EUROPE IS HOME 
TO A HOST OF OTHER MARINE LIFE 
SUMMER'S THE BEST TIME TO SEE VISITORS AND RESIDENTS ALIKE 
PERHAPS DINGLE'S MOST FAMOUS RESIDENT IS A WILD BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN CALLED FUNGI 
PEOPLE COME FROM FAR AND WIDE TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF FUNGI 
ONE OF IRELAND'S BIGGEST SHOW OFFS 
FUNGI ARRIVED IN DINGLE MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO 
AND NOW HE'S THE UNOFFICIAL HARBOUR MASTER 
FUNGI'S A TRULY WILD DOLPHIN 
HE JUST SEEMS TO ENJOY THE COMPANY OF PEOPLE 
AT FOUR METRES LONG HE'S SURPRISINGLY ACROBATIC 
AND FUNGI'S NOT THE ONLY MARINE MAMMAL IN THESE WATERS 
MICK O'CONNELL KEEPS AN EYE OUT FOR A TURTLE AS HE WATCHES DOLPHINS 
FROM THE DINGLE CLIFFS 
I USED TO BE ONE OF THE ONES WHO THOUGHT FUNGI WAS THE ONLY DOLPHIN 
THIS SIDE OF AUSTRALIA YOU KNOW 
BUT JUST TO REALISE THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY SO MUCH MORE OUT THERE 
FUNGI'S LESS FLAMBOYANT COUSINS CRUISE THE DINGLE COAST 
THE BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS IF THEY'RE TRAVELLING YOU'LL JUST MAINLY SEE THE DORSAL FIN BACKS 
OCCASIONALLY THEY MIGHT BREACH OUT OF THE WATER BUT QUITE OFTEN WHEN THEY COME IN THEY'RE COMING INTO FEED 
SO WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS A LOT MORE MILLING AROUND CHANGING DIRECTION LOT OF SPLASHING 
LOT OF BREACHING MAYBE TAIL SLAPPING A LOT OF ACTIVITY 
THE DINGLE PENINSULA STICKS RIGHT OUT INTO THE ATLANTIC 
AND THE CURRENTS THAT SURROUND IT CARRY NUTRIENTS THAT HELP CREATE 
SOME OF THE RICHEST SEAS IN THE WORLD 
IN SUMMER IT'S A MAGNET FOR MARINE LIFE 
TURTLES AREN'T THE ONLY UNEXPECTED VISITORS 
SOMEONE WAS WATCHING BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS OFF INCH STRAND 
AND NEXT THING THEY SAW A BIGGER BREACH FURTHER OUT AND THEY KNEW IT WAS TOO BIG FOR A BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN 
AND IT TURNED OUT ACTUALLY TO BE A JUVENILE HUMPBACK WHALE 
IT'S HARD SOMETIMES TO GUESS THE LENGTH BUT WE RECKON MAYBE 
UP TO SEVEN SIX OR SEVEN METRES 
MAYBE NOT A NEWBORN CALF BUT CERTAINLY QUITE A YOUNG ANIMAL 
THE HUMPBACK WHALE IT'S QUITE EASILY IDENTIFIED 
BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT THESE REAL LONG PECTORAL FINS 
ALSO THE COLOURING THE BLACK THE WHITE 
AND WHEN IT DIVES IT HAS THAT DISTINCTIVE HUMP ON ITS BACK 
IF YOU START TO SEE JUVENILE HUMPBACK WHALES OFF THE COAST OF KERRY THEN YOU HAVE TO ASK 
WHERE ARE THEY ACTUALLY BREEDING 
ARE THEY BREEDING A BIT CLOSER THAN WE REALISED MAYBE IT'S OFFSHORE JUST OFF THE COAST 
THE ONE ANIMAL I DO SEEM TO HAVE MISSED IS THE LEATHERBACK TURTLE 
WHICH I'VE JUST MISSED BY TWENTY MINUTES FROM BRANDON POINT LAST YEAR 
SO THAT'S ONE THAT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE NOW OVER THE SUMMER 
MICK'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'D LIKE TO SEE A TURTLE 
WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH THE SEASON AND THERE HASN'T BEEN A SIGHTING OF A TURTLE YET 
SO IT'S A BIT WORRYING BUT WE'VE STILL A BIT OF TIME LEFT 
FINGERS CROSSED A TURTLE WILL TURN UP PRETTY SOON 
IN THE MEANTIME TOM CONTINUES HIS RESEARCH INTO WHAT DRAWS THE TURTLES HERE 
LEATHERBACK TURTLES FEED ON JELLYFISH AND SO LIKE ANY ANIMAL TO UNDERSTAND THE ANIMAL ITSELF 
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT FEEDS ON SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBER OF JELLYFISH 
THAT ARE ABOUT WHICH TYPE OF JELLYFISHES ARE ACTUALLY OFF THE COAST HERE 
WHEN YOU GET IN THE WATER AND YOU'RE SWIMMING WITH THEM THEY'RE JUST SUPERB 
AND SEEING ALL THE LITTLE ANIMALS THAT LIVE UNDERNEATH THEM IT'S JUST LIKE A FLOATING HABITAT 
WHERE YOU GET ALL THESE LITTLE FISH HANGING AROUND AND IT'S JUST REALLY REALLY SPECIAL 
THE COMPASS JELLYFISH HAS THESE BEAUTIFUL BROWN V. SHAPED MARKINGS 
LIKE THE SPOKES OF A WHEEL REALLY 
IT'S VERY SLOW KIND OF UM THIS RHYTHMIC PULSE 
AND THEY JUST DRIFT SLOWLY PAST YOU AND YOU CAN SEE THE TENTACLES JUST TRAILING OFF BEHIND THEM 
IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL 
LEATHERBACKS SURVIVE ON JELLYFISH AND HOW THEY DO SO IS BASICALLY THEY FIND A PATCH OF JELLYFISH 
WHERE THERE'D BE THOUSANDS OF JELLYFISH AND SO THEY CAN JUST MUNCH AWAY IN THE SAME WAY AS A COW 
YOU THINK OF THE SIZE OF A COW THEY'RE HUGE BUT THEY SURVIVE ON GRASS 
WHICH IS JUST A PLANT 
TURTLES THEY SURVIVE ON JELLYFISH BY EATING LARGE QUANTITIES 
SO IT'S WORTH THE TURTLE'S TIME TO COME ALL THE WAY UP HERE 
IT'LL TAKE 'EM A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO GET UP HERE BUT ONCE THEY DO IT'S A BONANZA 
AND THEY GO MAD ON THE JELLYFISH AND THEY PUT ON SOME WEIGHT BEFORE THE HEAD SOUTH AGAIN 
SO WE'RE ALL READY AND THERE'S JELLYFISH THERE SO WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR A TURTLE NOW 
THE LARGEST LEATHERBACK EVER RECORDED WASHED UP ON A BEACH IN NORTH WALES BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT 
IT WEIGHED NEARLY A TONNE 
LEATHERBACKS SURVIVE IN COOLER WATERS THANKS TO THEIR HUGE SIZE 
AND A UNIQUE ABILITY TO RAISE THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE 
THEY'RE THE ONLY WARM BLOODED REPTILE 
BUT VERY FEW MIGRATE THIS FAR NORTH 
EACH SUMMER THERE MAY BE JUST A HUNDRED LEATHERBACKS IN IRISH AND BRITISH WATERS 
THAT'S A LOT OF SEA AND VERY FEW TURTLES 
DINGLE'S ATLANTIC WATERS HAVE BIG BLOOMS OF JELLYFISH 
SO THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO SPOT A LEATHERBACK 
BUT IT'S THE HELP TOM'S GETTING FROM THE SALMON FISHERMEN 
WHO SOMETIMES CATCH A TURTLE IN THEIR NETS THAT IS CRUCIAL TO HIS RESEARCH 
PADRAIG HASN'T SEEN A TURTLE SO FAR THIS SEASON 
BUT HE'S HAD SEVERAL CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OVER THE YEARS 
SO WHAT'S IT LIKE TO NET A MONSTER OF THE DEEP 
WELL YOU'RE HAULING THE NET IT MIGHT BE GOING DOWN A SMALL BIT LIKE AND THEN YOU'LL SEE IT MOVING 
AND WHEN YOU LIKE PULL ALONGSIDE IT THEN YOU'LL SEE THE BIG BLACK THING IN THE WATER 
AND THE FLIPPERS OUT OF HIM LIKE 
THEY'RE VERY BIG AND THEY'RE VERY HEAVY SO THEY'RE AWKWARD 
PADRAIG MAY NOT HAVE FOUND A TURTLE YET THIS YEAR BUT HE'S GOT PLENTY OF OTHER COMPANY TO ENJOY 
SOME DAYS YOU CAN BE STEAMING ALONG 
AND HAVE ABOUT THIRTY DOLPHINS EACH SIDE OF YOU 
THEY ALWAYS ATTRACT YOUR EYE AND THEY ALWAYS GO FOR THE BOW OF THE BOAT LIKE SWIMMING OFF THE BOW 
ON A FINE DAY IT'S LOVELY TO SEE THEM 
THERE ARE MUCH BIGGER FISH THAN SALMON IN THESE WATERS TOO 
WE SEE A LOT OF BASKING SHARKS EARLY IN THE YEAR 
THEY GROW FROM THIRTY FEET THEY COULD BE FORTY FIFTY FEET SOME OF THEM LIKE 
THEY SWIM VERY SLOWLY AND THEY FEED A LOT AROUND HERE ON THE PLANKTON VERY EARLY IN THE YEAR 
STILL NO TURTLES 
BUT PADRAIG IS ALSO WORRYING ABOUT THE FISHING BAN 
I DON'T THINK I EVER MISSED IT OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE OR TWENTY SIX YEARS LIKE 
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER MISSED A SEASON IT IS A WAY OF LIFE IN A SMALL VILLAGE 
IF SALMON DRIFTNET FISHING IS BANNED PADRAIG FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
IT'S GOING TO BE BAD 
IF THIS COMES ABOUT LIKE YOU KNOW I FEEL VERY ANGRY ABOUT IT 
AND I FEEL THAT ER SOMETHING IS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM US 
THAT SHOULDN'T BE TAKEN AWAY FROM US IF I SAW A REASON I'D GO ALONG WITH IT 
BUT I DON'T SEE A REASON I DON'T KNOW SEE ANY REASON AT ALL 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO 
I DON'T THINK I CAN TURN AROUND NOW AND GO INTO A BUILDING JOB OR DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I JUST DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT AT THE MOMENT LIKE 
THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT LIKE 
A BAN ON SALMON FISHING WOULD ALSO END TOM'S RESEARCH 
IF HE'S GOING TO TAG A TURTLE HE'S GOT TO DO IT BEFORE THIS SUMMER'S END 
AND THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER STRANGE JELLYFISH EATER MAY BE A GOOD SIGN 
THERE'S ANOTHER ANIMAL THAT WE SEE OFF THE WATERS HERE 
IN JUNE SLASH JULY AND IT'S THE SUNFISH AND THEY'RE A FANTASTIC ANIMAL 
VERY UNUSUAL FISH WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THEM 
ON A FLAT CALM DAY IS THE BEST TIME TO SEE THEM BECAUSE THEY JUST COME TO THE SURFACE 
AND THEIR DORSAL FIN YOU CAN SEE IT BREAKING THE SURFACE 
AND IT WILL BE JUST FLICKING BACK AND FORTH THE WHOLE TIME AND IT REALLY CATCHES YOUR EYE 
THEY'RE VERY WEIRD LOOKING FISH 
THE GERMANS CALL THEM SWIMMING HEADS BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THEY ARE A HEAD 
THEIR WHOLE BODY HAS BEEN TRUNCATED TWO BIG FINS AND A HEAD BUT REALLY FLATTENED 
AND THEN HUGE BIG LIPS 
AND A WEIRD LOOKING FISH BUT WE REALLY KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT THESE ANIMALS 
LEATHERBACK SEA TURTLES AND SUNFISH HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON AND THAT'S THEIR FOOD BOTH FEED ON JELLYFISH 
SO WHEN YOU SEE SUNFISH ABOUT YOU GET A BIT EXCITED THAT MAYBE THERE'S A TURTLE AROUND THE CORNER 
I'M VERY NERVOUS AND THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON IT YOU KNOW 
IT'D BE GREAT TO GET A TURTLE AND WE'VE INVESTED A LOT OF TIME 
WITH TIME NOW RUNNING OUT TOM ENLISTS MORE HELP 
OCEAN EXPLORER VINCENT HYLAND AND HIS COUSIN PAT SPEND MUCH OF THEIR TIME 
WAY OUT IN THE BIG BLUE LOOKING FOR UNUSUAL ANIMALS 
WHEN YOU LOOK OUT TO THE OCEAN YOU ALWAYS WONDER WHAT'S OUT THERE 
IN ORDER TO SATISFY THAT WISH IF YOU LIKE 
YOU GO OUT AND IF YOU COME ACROSS THESE SPECIES 
LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE LEATHERBACK TURTLES THEN YOU REALLY ARE COMING ACROSS SOMETHING EXOTIC 
BECAUSE THESE HAVE COME UP FROM FAR FAR FAR DOWN 
AS HE SEARCHES FOR A TURTLE VINNY HEADS FOR ONE PLACE HE KNOWS IS A HOTSPOT FOR MARINE ACTIVITY 
HIS FIRST LANDMARKS WITHIN THE VASTNESS OF THE OPEN OCEAN ARE A COUPLE OF SMALL ISLANDS 
EIGHT MILES OFF THE KERRY COAST 
THE SKELLIG ROCKS ARE TWO PINNACLED SANDSTONE ROCKS 
THERE'S SKELLIG MICHAEL WHICH IS NAMED AFTER SAINT MICHAEL AND SKELLIG BHEAG 
BHEAG BEING THE IRISH FOR SMALL HAS A GANNET COLONY ON IT 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF BIRDS 
AND FROM THE DISTANCE LIKE SKELLIG BHEAG IS THE WHITER OF THE TWO ROCKS 
BECAUSE IT'S COVERED IN WHITE FEATHERED GANNETS AND ALL THIS WHITE POO 
IT'S QUITE PINNACLED IT'S QUITE HIGH WITH AROUND FORTY THOUSAND BIRDS 
IT IS AN INCREDIBLE FEELING TO BE WITH SO MANY BIRDS 
AND THESE ARE NOT JUST SMALL BIRDS THESE ARE BIRDS THAT HAVE YOU KNOW FIVE AND A HALF SIX FOOT WINGSPANS 
THEY HAVE THIS BEAUTIFULLY ALMOST PAINTED FACE 
AND BLACK LINES ALONG THEIR BEAK AND AROUND THEIR EYES AND THEIR EYES ARE BRIGHT BLUE 
THEY'RE THE MOST MAGNIFICENT SEABIRD 
SO IN ALL THE YEARS VINNY'S BEEN OUT AT SEA HOW MANY TURTLES HAS HE ACTUALLY SEEN 
WELL SOMETIMES WHEN WE'VE BEEN OUT WE THINK WE'VE COME ACROSS TURTLES YOU KNOW 
BUT IT'S BEEN FAIRLY JUST FLEETING I SUPPOSE OR JUST THE HEAD POPPING UP AND DISAPPEARING YOU KNOW 
VINNY CARRIES ON HIS SEARCH 
BUT EVEN IN THESE PERFECT CALM CONDITIONS 
LOOKING FOR A TURTLE REALLY IS LIKE LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK 
OTHERS AREN'T SO SHY A POD OF COMMON DOLPHINS LETS HIM COME ALONG FOR THE RIDE 
THEY ALLOWED US TO RUN WITH THEM AS THEY WERE GOING FROM FEEDING PLACE TO FEEDING PLACE 
SO THEY IGNORED US EVENTUALLY SOMETIMES THEY'D BOW RIDE THE BOAT 
TO SEE THEM JUST SWIMMING ALONGSIDE PORPOISING WITH THEIR SOUNDS THAT THEY MAKE 
AND YOU ALMOST FEEL AS IF YOU CAN TOUCH THESE THINGS YOU'RE SO CLOSE 
AND THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST MAGICAL EXPERIENCES YOU'LL EVER HAVE IN YOUR LIFE 
LITTLE DID WE KNOW THAT THIS GROUP WERE OBVIOUSLY JUST BREAKING AWAY TEMPORARILY FROM THE MAIN GROUP 
AND IF FOOD WAS FOUND WELL THEN THEY'D ALL COME IN FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS 
AND ACTUALLY JOIN THE GROUP SO THE GROUP WENT FROM MAYBE THIRTY TO FORTY TO FIFTY TO SIXTY TO SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED 
IT WAS JUST THE MOST INCREDIBLE FEELING 
BECAUSE HERE WE WERE WITH SOME OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT CREATURES IN THE WORLD 
AND IT WAS ALL HAPPENING IF YOU LIKE OFF THE COAST OF KERRY 
SO DESPITE HIS EFFORTS EVEN VINNY CAN'T TRACK DOWN A LEATHERBACK 
TOM'S OPTIONS ARE NOW RUNNING OUT AND THE FISHERMEN'S MAY BE TOO 
AS THE SALMON SEASON DRAWS TO AN END THESE COULD BE PADRAIG'S LAST FEW DAYS OF FISHING 
IT'S KIND OF A SAD DAY HERE IF IT'S THE LAST DAY LIKE BUT WE KIND OF DON'T BELIEVE IT IS 
WE CAN'T GET IT INTO OUR HEAD THAT IT IS THE LAST DAY LIKE YOU KNOW 
THAT'S MY YOUNG FELLOW THERE ON THE BOAT 
AND HE'D BE PROBABLY MAKING A CAREER OUT OF IT AS WELL LIKE 
YOU KNOW SO IT'S VERY SAD LIKE 
IN THIS TRADITIONAL IRISH SPEAKING COMMUNITY A BAN ON SALMON FISHING WOULD BE DEVASTATING 
AND IT MEANS IT'S NOW OR NEVER FOR TOM 
BUT IN THE LAST DAYS OF THE SEASON TOM FINALLY GETS THE CALL HE'S BEEN WAITING FOR ALL SUMMER 
WE'RE JUST AFTER GETTING A CALL FROM ONE OF THE SALMON FISHERMEN 
THAT A TURTLE'S BECOME ENTANGLED IN HIS NETS SO WE'RE JUST HEADING OUT 
TO SECURE THE TURTLE AND PUT A TAG ON IT SO IT'S QUITE CRITICAL THAT WE GET THERE NOW 
SPEED IS THE NAME OF THE GAME NOW 
TOM'S GOING TO NEED ALL THE HELP HE CAN GET SO HE RADIOS AHEAD TO PADRAIG 
THEY'RE NEVER REALLY TANGLED IN THE NETS THEY JUST BOUNCE OF THEM SO IT COULD EASILY SWIM AWAY 
SO WE JUST NEED TO GET TO THE TURTLE AS QUICK AS WE CAN NOW 
ONCE THEY REACH THE FISHERMEN TOM FIRST NEEDS TO SECURE THE TURTLE 
TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T SLIP AWAY 
BUT IT WON'T BE EASY THIS ONE'S WELL OVER TWO METRES LONG 
TOM'S MADE A HARNESS BUT HE WASN'T EXPECTING SUCH A BIG LEATHERBACK 
SO WILL IT FIT 
ALL RIGHT THEN I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE WATER 
YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE ON THE LINE SO THIS IS IT 
TOM YOU'RE NOT ON THE LINE 
I THINK IT'S TOO TIGHT 
IT'S TOO SMALL 
NO YOU CAN DEFINITELY GET IT AROUND HER BUM 
I THINK THAT'S POSSIBLY THE BIGGEST TURTLE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE 
TOM'S JUST CALLED BACK THAT THAT'S A MALE 
THIS IS HUGE WE NEED TO GET A ROPE AROUND IT 
I'VE GOT IT AROUND HER BUM 
IS THE HARNESS WAY TOO SMALL 
IT'S DO OR DIE 
THIS IS THE MOMENT EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON 
BUT TOM'S HAVING TROUBLE GETTING TO GRIPS WITH THE GIANT TURTLE 
JUST GET A ROPE AND I'LL TIE IT AROUND HER 
WITH THE HARNESS TOO SMALL AND THE TURTLE UNSECURED IT COULD BREAK FREE AT ANY MOMENT 
THEN PADRAIG ARRIVES JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME 
PADRAIG RIGS UP A BIGGER HARNESS 
AND TOM MAKES A LAST ATTEMPT 
YOU'VE GOT HER 
I'VE SECURED HIM 
TOM FINALLY ATTACHES THE SATELLITE TAG TO THE TURTLE'S SHELL 
AND SETS IT FREE 
THE TURTLE CONTINUES ITS JOURNEY UNHARMED 
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW TOM COULD BE PICKING UP ITS SIGNAL 
FROM THE CARIBBEAN FIVE THOUSAND MILES AWAY 
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE JOB DONE TO GET A TAG ON A TURTLE BUT IT'S ONLY WITH THIS COMMUNITY 
ESPECIALLY THE SALMON FISHERMEN THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY DO THIS 
HE REALLY SUFFERED TO GET THE TURTLE LIKE SO I WAS DELIGHTED FOR TOM 
BECAUSE HE REALLY PUT A LOT OF EFFORT 
TO TAG THIS TURTLE 
GETTING THIS SATELLITE TAG ON THIS TURTLE WILL MEAN A LOT 
TO UNDERSTANDING THE MOVEMENTS OF THESE ANIMALS 
SO IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE IMPORTANT FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THIS SPECIES 
THAT WE UNDERSTAND THEIR MOVEMENTS IN THE WHOLE ATLANTIC 
IT'S BEEN A GREAT SUMMER FANTASTIC 
IRISH SALMON FISHERMEN LIKE PADRAIG ARE STILL HOPING THEY'LL BE BACK OUT ON THE WATER NEXT SEASON 
AND IF THEY ARE THEIR UNLIKELY ALLIANCE WITH THE TURTLE SCIENTISTS 
WILL HELP DISCOVER MORE ABOUT THE ENDANGERED LEATHERBACKS 
AS THE SEARCH CONTINUES 
FOR IRELAND'S GIANT TURTLES
