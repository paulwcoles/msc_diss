WILL WIND ITS WAY THROUGH LONDON AT 
THE WEEKEND 
THE BRIXTON JOCKEY HOPING ONE DAY 
TO RIDE TO GLORY IN THE GRAND 
NATIONAL NATIONAL PLUS A CUBAN DANCE TROUPE BRINGING 
SOME LATIN MAGIC TO THE LONDON 
STAGE 
A VERY GOOD EVENING AND A WARM 
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME 
NOW IT IS WHAT EVERY PASSENGER 
DREADS HAVING TO GET OFF THE TUBE 
AND WALK THROUGH DARK TUNNELS TO 
SAFETY THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED LAST 
NIGHT WHEN NINE TRAINS WERE STOPPED 
IN THEIR TRACKS ON THE JUBILEE LINE 
IT LEFT THOUSANDS OF COMMUTERS 
STRANDED THE POWER CUT MEANT 
CONTROL ROOM STAFF HAD NO RADIO 
CONTACT WITH THE DRIVERS BELOW OUR 
TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT TOM EDWARDS 
HAS THIS REPORT 
TAKE YOUR TIME NICE AND EASY THE THE VOICE OF UNDERGROUND STAFF URGING 
COMMUTERS TO TAKE CARE AS 
CAUTIOUSLY STILL CLUTCHING THEIR 
BAGS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY ALONG THE 
TRACKS HERE A PASSENGER TAKES A 
PICTURE WITH HER PHONE THIS WAS 
THE EXPERIENCE OF THOUSANDS OF 
COMMUTERS LAST NIGHT ON THE JUBILEE 
LINE HERE STAFF COUNT THE 
PASSENGERS AS THEY FINALLY REACH 
THE PLATFORM THE FOOTAGE WAS TAKEN 
BY CAROLINE SHE SAYS EVERY ONE WAS 
CALM BUT SHE IS CONCERNED HER TRAIN 
DRIVER LOST CONTACT WITH THE 
CONTROL ROOM 
HE DIDN'T KNOW 
ANYTHING UNTIL THEY CAME TO GET US 
I THINK HIS ONLY COMMUNICATION WAS 
WHEN SOMEBODY WENT TO HIM SO IT IS 
QUITE BAD THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN B. 
IN TOTAL NINE TRAINS WERE STRANDED 
ON THE JUBILEE LINE BETWEEN GREEN 
PARK AND NORTH GREENWICH LONDON 
UNDERGROUND SAY THAT LAST NIGHT 
KNEES DON CONTROL CENTRE SUFFERED A 
CATASTROPHIC POWER FAILURE WHEN 
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT FAILED THAT 
MEANT THEY HAD NO C. C. T. V. NO SIGNALS 
NO RADIO COMMUNICATION AND THEIR 
BACK UP POWER FAILED DRIVERS 
EVENTUALLY HAD TO USE TRACKSIDE 
PHONES TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING 
ON LONDON UNDERGROUND SAY NEW 
DIGITAL RADIO SYSTEM IS DUE TO BE 
INSTALLED NEXT MONTH 
WE HAVE GOT A 
NEW TRAIN RADIO SYSTEM COMING IN AS 
PART OF AN UPGRADE

LAST MINUTE TODAY THE POLICE ARE 
SAYING THEY WON'T HESITATE TO 
CHANGE THE ROUTE TO CHANGE THE 
PLANS IF THOSE PROTESTS SEEM TO

I HAVE SPOKEN TO ARE EXTREMELY 
PROUD TO BE PART OF SUCH A BIG DAY 
FOR THE CAPITAL 
YOU CAN SEE FULL HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 
DAY ON ROAD TO BEIJING THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH IN LONDON ON SUNDAY 
EVENING AT TEN FIFTEEN P. M. ON B. B. C. ONE 
M. P.S' EXPENSES ARE UNDER SCRUTINY 
WITH NEW DETAILS RELEASED OF HOW 
MUCH THEY HAVE CLAIMED WHAT ABOUT 
OUR REPRESENTATIVES HERE AT CITY 
HALL THEY SEEM TO SHOW A NUMBER OF 
LONDON'S ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TO BE 
EARNING THOUSANDS OF POUNDS ON TOP 
OF THEIR SALARIES FOR VARIETY OF 
ROLES KARL MERCER HAS BEEN TAKING 
A CLOSER LOOK 
THIS IS CITY HALL HOME TO THE 
MAYOR OF LONDON WHO WORKS UP THERE 
ON THE EIGHTH FLOOR IT IS ALSO 
HOME TO THE LONDON ASSEMBLY NOW 
FOR THOSE OF YOU NOT IN THE KNOW 
THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE MEMBERS EACH OF THEM 
BEING PAID FIFTY THOUSAND YEAR IN TOTAL 
THAT'S OVER ONE MILLION WE SHELL OUT 
FOR THEIR SERVICES FOR MANY THERE 
IS ALSO MONEY TO BE EARNED OUTSIDE 
OF CITY HALL LET'S TAKE A WALK 
DOWN THE RIVER AND ARRIVE AT THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS TWO ASSEMBLY 
MEMBERS ARE ALSO M. P.'S THEY EARN 
SIXTY THOUSAND IN THAT ROLE THAT IS ON 
TOP OF THE THIRTY THOUSAND THEY CAN CLAIM 
AS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS A FEW HUNDRED 
YARDS DOWN THE ROAD WE FIND THE 
HOUSE OF LORDS TWO ASSEMBLY 
MEMBERS ARE LIFE PEERS IN FACT 
THAT IS NOT THE END OF IT IN TOWN 
HALLS YOU WILL FIND LONDON 
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS SERVING AS LOCAL 
COUNCILLORS FOR THAT THEY CAN GET 
PAID ANYTHING BETWEEN NINE THOUSAND AND 
TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND THE CONSERVATIVE 
COUNCILLOR IS ONE SUCH MEMBER IS 
BEING ON THE ASSEMBLY A FULL TIME 
JOB 
IN MY VIEW NOT IT WAS JOB ENVISAGED TO BE A PART TIME ROLE 
IT WAS THEN BY PRESSURE I THINK 
BY THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN ELECTED 
IT BECAME A MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT 
ROLE IN THEIR LIVES 
LABOUR'S LEN 
DUVALL IS ONE OF THE ASSEMBLY'S BIG 
FISH HE GETS PAID TWENTY ONE THOUSAND A YEAR 
AS AN NON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A 
PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT COMPANY I I SPEND ONE TO TWO DAYS A MONTH DOING 
THAT AND MAINTAINING THAT INTEREST 
I DON'T THINK THAT WORKS 
IS IT 
RIGHT THAT YOU HAVE THAT INTEREST 
PROVIDING YOU ARE TRANSPARENT ABOUT 
IT PROVIDING YOU FOLLOW THE RULES 
AND THE RULES ARE VERY CLEAR THE THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER RUNS A 
SMALL BUSINESS AND SEES NO WRONG IN 
IT 
THE TRADITION IS THAT IT POLITICIANS DO HAVE A RANGE OF 
INTERESTS THEY HAD A LIFE BEFORE 
POLITICS HOPEFULLY THEY HAVE A 
LIFE AFTER POLITICS IT STRENGTHENS 
POLITICIANS IF PEOPLE KEEP THEIR 
FEET ON THE GROUND 
ONE OF TWO 
GREENS ON THE ASSEMBLY DARREN 
JOHNSON IS ALSO A LOCAL COUNCILLOR 
THE ROLES CAN WORK TOGETHER HE 
INSISTS 
I CAN'T SEE HOW ANYONE CAN INSISTS HOLD DOWN A PROPER FULL TIME JOB A 
NINE TO FIVE JOB AND BE AN EFFECTIVE 
ASSEMBLY MEMBER THERE IS A BIG 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOING THAT AND 
BEING AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND A 
LOCAL COUNCILLOR THEY GO VERY WELL 
TOGETHER 
WHAT DOES THE ALL SEEING TOGETHER EYE OF THE FOREMOST EXPERT IN 
LONDON GOVERNMENT MAKE OF IT IT IS 
TIME HE SAYS FOR CHANGE ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHO IS ARE PAID AS FULL TIME 
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ARE NEVER GOING TO 
BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH HAVING ONE 
OR MORE OTHER APPARENTLY FULL TIME 
JOB IT IS JUST A CONFLICT IT IS A 
GENUINE CONFLICT THE PUBLIC WOULD 
NEVER UNDERSTAND IT IF IT WERE NOT 
THE ASSEMBLY HAS CALLED FOR MORE 
POWER THOSE CALLS WON'T GO AWAY 
SOME BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE TO 
COMMIT MORE FULLY TO THE JOB IF 
THAT IS TO BE THE CASE 
YESTERDAY THE MAYORAL ELECTION 
RACE GOT PERSONAL WITH REVELATIONS 
ABOUT KEN LIVINGSTONE'S PRIVATE 
LIFE TODAY IT WAS BORIS JOHNSON'S 
TURN TO HAVE THE SPOTLIGHT TURNED 
UPON HIM THE CONSERVATIVE 
CANDIDATE HAS PREVIOUSLY ADMITTED 
HE'S TAKEN CANNABIS THERE WAS SOME 
CONFUSION OVER WHETHER HE HAD TRIED 
COCAINE A CLASS A DRUG 
CONFUSION AROSE TODAY OVER AN 
INTERVIEW GIVEN BY BORIS JOHNSON TO 
MARIE CLAIRE MAGAZINE HIS CAMPAIGN 
TEAM INSIST HE NEVER HAS TAKEN 
COCAINE THOUGH THERE WAS ONE 
OCCASION WHEN HE WAS OFFERED 
WHITE SUBSTANCE WHICH HE DID NOT 
SNORT 
YOU CAN'T VOTE IN THE SNORT MAYORAL ELECTIONS 
WHEN HE WAS A 
TEENAGER HE'S ADMITTED HE DID 
SMOKE CANNABIS THAT'S ONLY 
REINFORCED HIS STRONG FEELINGS NOW 
ABOUT DRUG USE 
EVERYBODY NOW 
RECOGNISES THAT WHATEVER WE MAY 
HAVE SMOKED AT UNIVERSITY MANY 
YEARS AGO OR EVEN BEFORE 
UNIVERSITY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM 
THE DAMAGING AND HARMFUL DRUGS THAT 
KIDS ARE BEING EXPOSED TO TODAY 
I'M NOT TOLERANT OF DRUGS BETTER BETTER TO VOTE FOR THE DEVIL YOU KNOW I'M I'M GETTING THE DEVIL VOTE KEN KEN LIVINGSTONE TODAY HIGHLIGHTING 
ELSE HE FINDS HARMFUL 
FAR RIGHT POLITICS HE SAYS HE 
NEVER SMOKED CANNABIS BECAUSE OF 
THE HEALTH RISKS HE WOULDN'T AGREE 
IF GORDON BROWN UPGRADED CANNABIS 
AGAIN 
IF YOU HAVE A PANEL OF AGAIN PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPECIALISED IN THIS 
AND THESE ARE SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE 
SPECIALISED IN THIS AREA YOU HAVE 
TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY ARE 
SAYING IT IS A MISTAKE TO SAY ALL 
DRUGS ARE DANGEROUS THEY AREN'T 
IT WAS THIS MAN WHO DID SO MUCH TO 
MOVE THE DRUGS DEBATE FORWARD BACK 
TODAY IN LAMBETH WHERE THAT 
HAPPENED WE ARE WHERE WE ARE NOW 
HE SAYS AND THE ATTENTION SHOULD 
BE ON HIGHLIGHTING THE DANGERS THE THE PRIME MINISTER SAYS HE WANTS TO 
SEND A STRONG MESSAGE TO YOUNG 
PEOPLE THAT CANNABIS IS DANGEROUS 
THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE SPENDING 
OUR TIME AND EFFORT ON DELIVERING 
HEALTH MESSAGES TO YOUNG PEOPLE 
TELLING YOUNG PEOPLE THAT CANNABIS 
IS VERY DANGEROUS IT CAN CAUSE 
SCHIZOPHRENIA RATHER THAN MESSING 
ABOUT WITH WHAT CLASS IT IS IN THE THE PERSONAL REVELATIONS HAVEN'T 
CRAMPED HIS STYLE AND OTHERS KNOW 
THAT MANY THINGS THEY MAY HAVE DONE 
IN THE PAST THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE 
KEPT PRIVATE 
NOW THE CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S ALLIANCE 
LAUNCHED THEIR MANIFESTO TODAY 
ALAN CRAIG SPOKE TO PEOPLE AT 
RIDLEY ROAD MARKET IN HACKNEY CLOSE 
TO WHERE JAMIE SIMPSON WAS STABBED

HOODIES IN AN IDEAL WORLD 
WE ARE 
NOT APPROACHING PEOPLE OR PUSHING 
OUR PRODUCTS ON ANYBODY WE HAVEN'T 
ADVERTISED ANYWHERE WE ARE 
LITERALLY PRODUCING PRODUCTS THAT

IN THE MARKET AND THE BULLET PROOF

OTHER PRODUCTS IT STARTED OUT BY 
MAKING SLASH RESISTANT GLOVES NEXT 
UP WERE THESE SWEATSHIRTS THEY 
COST SIXTY FIVE THEY ARE ALSO SLASH 
RESISTANT AND THEY HAVE SOLD TWO THOUSAND 
HERE AND IN THE STATES SOME THINK 
THE RANGE IS DISTASTEFUL

ABOUT A QUICK BUCK THEY ARE NOT 
INTERESTED IN OUR CHILDREN L. HAVE 
HEARD ALL THE EXCUSES PEOPLE WANT 
THEM THEY WILL MAKE THEM FEEL 
BETTER THEY ARE BUYING INTO A WAY 
OF LIVING THAT IS VIOLENCE ON THE

LATEST MUST HAVE ACCESSORY OUR OUR PRODUCTS ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT 
PROTECTION NOT FOR THOSE WHO WANT 
TO CAUSE TROUBLE 
YOU CAN'T 
GUARANTEE IT THOUGH 
WE CAN'T 
GUARANTEE THAT WHAT I WOULD LIKE 
IS FOR SOMEONE TO BE SAVED IN THIS 
CASHING IN OR NOT THERE IS 
INTEREST JUST TODAY THE COMPANY 
RECEIVED ONE HUNDRED E. MAILS ASKING ABOUT 
THE TOPS 
STILL TO COME THE BRIXTON JOCKEY 
HOPING TO MAKE HORSE RACING HISTORY 
ON THE COURSE AT AINTREE

HALF A BILLION POUNDS COULD BE BET 
ON SPORTING EVENTS ONE IN THREE OF 
THE NATION WILL PLACE A BET ON THE 
GRAND NATIONAL WHILE THE F. A. CUP 
CITY FINAL AND RUGBY EUROPEAN CUP 
MATCHES ADD TO THE BETTING FRENZY 
MARK IS WITH ME NOW WE WILL TALK 
ABOUT THE NATIONAL IN A MOMENT A 
HISTORIC WEEKEND FOR TWO OF 
LONDON'S RUGBY CLUBS ABSENTLY ABSENTLY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY 
HAVE MADE IT THROUGH TO THE QUARTER 
FINALS OF THE EUROPEAN CUP THAT IS 
LIKE THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FOR RUGBY 
THE QUALITY CAME TO THE TOP 
OSPREYS WELL WORTH THE VICTORY 
THEY WILL BE HAPPY WITH THAT 
SARACENS WERE FAR FROM HAPPY THAT 
WAS THE RESULT OF THEIR RECENT 
MEETING IN THE ANGLO IRISH CUP HOW HOW MUCH SHOULD WE TAKE FROM THAT 
RESULT 
I HOPE NONE SERIOUSLY RESULT THEY WERE BY FAR THE BETTER SIDE 
THAT DAY 
YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM FOR OSPREYS 
WELL THEY ARE BASICALLY THIS LOT 
THEY HAVE A LOT OF GUYS WITH A LOT 
OF CONFIDENCE AND IT CARRIED 
THROUGH FROM THE SIX NATIONS THEY 
ARE A GOOD TEAM AND WE WILL BE UP 
AGAINST IT IN SAYING IT I DON'T 
THINK THERE IS ANY LUCK IN US BEING 
INVOLVED IN THE QUARTER FINAL IF IF SATURDAY THINK THEY HAVE A TOUGH 
CHALLENGE THINK OF LONDON IRISH 
ANOTHER LONDON CLUB IN UNCHARTERED 
TERRITORY FOR NEITHER SARACENS OR 
LONDON IRISH HAVE MADE THE LAST 
EIGHT BUT AMONG IRISH RANKS A 
WORLD CUP WINNING ENGLISHMAN WE WE ALL HAVE ASPIRATIONS TO WIN THE CUP 
WE ALL HAVE GOOD EXPERIENCE FRFPLT 
A REVENUE POINT OF VIEW PUTTING 
LONDON IRISH UP THERE IT'S HUGE 
HOW ARE THE LEGS 
THEY ARE HANGING 
IN THERE L. CAN STILL KICK A BALL IN MY HANDS AND STILL PASS SO I AM 
HAPPY WITH THAT 
A VETERAN MAYBE 
BUT CATT COULD BE KEY TO OVERCOMING 
PERPIGNAN BOTH LONDON IRISH AND 
SARACENS ADMIT THEY ARE UNDERDOGS 
BUT EVERY DOG HAS ITS DAY GOOD 
LUCK TO THE TEAMS THERE LET'S MOVE 
ON TO THE GRAND NATIONAL HAVE YOU 
BEEN BUSY GOING AROUND ORGANISING 
THE OFFICE SWEEPSTAKE FOR THE 
NATIONAL WHAT IS YOUR TIP IT IT WON'T BE ME I DROVE A ONE HUNDRED TO ONE 
OUTSIDER IRONICALLY THE BOSS GOT 
THE FAVOURITE SOME PEOPLE ARE 
CRYING FOUL THERE IS NOTHING LIKE 
THE GRAND NATIONAL THAT GETS THE 
PEOPLE EXCITED FOR ONE YOUNG MAN 
RICKY ALLEYNE HE WILL BE WATCHING 
WITH INTEREST HE IS GOING TO BE 
THE FIRST BLACK PERSON TO WIN THE 
GRAND NATIONAL 
RICKY IS FAR FROM 
TYPICAL RIDING STOCK BUT THE EIGHTEEN 
YEAR OLD IS STRIDING OUT FOR 
SUCCESS HE BELIEVE THERE IS IS NO 
LIMIT TO WHAT HE CAN ACHIEVE I I WANT TO BE A JUMP JOCKEY AND ONE 
DAY IN THE GRAND NATIONAL L. WILL 
HAVE TO DO HARD WORK TRAINING A 
LOT THEN I WILL GET THERE IT'S IT'S FAR FROM A RACING CERTAINTY THAT HE 
WILL REACH THAT LEVEL BUT HE HAS 
TAKEN THE FIRST STEPS HAVING JUST 
PASS A NINE WEEK FOUNDATION COURSE 
TO COME FROM INSIDE LONDON AND OUT 
HERE TO FOLLOW A DREAM THINK 
THAT IS FANTASTIC JUST WISH MORE 
YOUNG PEOPLE TOOK THAT ON BOARD 
THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE 
IT'S A 
SPORT SADDLED WITH A REPUTATION OF 
BEING ELITIST BUT RICKY'S 
ACHIEVEMENTS COULD HELP DRAW A NEW 
FOLLOWING 
FOR EXAMPLE GOLF TIGER FOLLOWING WOODS HAS GIVEN MANY PEOPLE OF 
ETHNIC BACK GROUNDS THE INSPIRATION 
TO PLAY GOLF NOW YOU GO TO MOST 
GOLF COURSE AND ALL OF THE RULES 
HAVE CHANGED AND THEY ARE ALLOWING 
ANYONE TO PLAY IT'S A SIMILAR 
STORY WITH RACING 
RICKY'S STORY IS 
A TRIBUTE TO THE EBB ONY HORSE CLUB 
IN BRIXTON THE FRIEND WHO TAUGHT 
HIM NATHAN FOSTER WAS SHOT DEAD 
LAST YEAR WHILE ATTEMPTED TO 
IMMEDIATE BETWEEN TWO MEN 
HE WAS A 
FANTASTIC ROLE MODEL BY THE TIME 
RICKY JOINED NATHAN WAS A COMPETENT 
RIDER IT'S DOWN TO HIM THAT A LOT 
OF BOYS JOINED WE WISH HIM WE 
KNOW HE IS WATCHING AND HE WILL BE 
PROUD OF RICKY 
CERTAINLY SOMEONE WE SHOULD KEEP AN 
EYE ON FOR THE FUTURE HALF 
MILLION POUNDS IS GOING TO BE BET 
THIS WEEKEND SOME OF IT WILL BE ON 
PART TWO OF THE ARSENAL LIVERPOOL 
TRILOGY 
OBVIOUSLY PART ONE TOOK TRILOGY PLACE ON WEDNESDAY IT WAS A DRAW 
ONE TO ONE I THOUGHT IT WAS A GAME THAT 
THEY SHOULD HAVE WON NOW THEY HAVE 
THIS RIDICULOUS THING OF A LEAGUE 
GAME IN BETWEEN 
THREE MATCHS IN 
CLOSE SUCCESS HOW IMPORTANT IS THE 
NEXT GAME FOR ARSENAL 
IT'S MORE 
IMPORTANT FOR LIVERPOOL ARSENAL 
STILL FEEL THEY CAN WIN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE THEY ARE SIX POINTS BEHIND 
MANCHESTER UNITED FOR RAFAEL 
BENITEZ KE REST SOME OF STAIR 
STARS BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO 
FINISH IN FOURTH 
WHICH TOURNAMENT WOULD ARSENAL 
RATHER WIN THE PREMIERSHIP OR THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
I BELIEVE IF YOU ASK THE FANS THEY 
SAY BOTH FOR ME I THINK IT'S THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE PURELY AND SIMPLY 
BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T WON IT THEY 
HAVE WON EVERYTHING DO MOSTICALLY 
THE BRAND OF FOOTBALL THEY PLAY IS 
SENSATIONAL WENGER DESERVES IT AND 
I WOULD SAY THE CLUB 
TOO 
AFTER CIGARS DANCE LIKE SAL IS A 
AND THE CHA CHA CHA ARE PROBABLY 
CUBA'S MOST FAMOUS EXPORTS 
CAPITALISINGEN THAT THE DANCE GROUP 
HAVANA HAVANA RAKATAN HAVE RETURNED 
TO THE U. K. 
FROM THE SULTRY RUMBA TO THE SPLIK 
FOOTWORK OF THE CHA CHA CHA THE 
SOUL AND SPIRIT OF CUBA IS BROUGHT 
TO THE STAGE COURTESY OF HAVANA 
RAKATAN IT'S DANCERS REGARDED AS 
THE MOST VERSATILE TO EMERGE FROM 
CUBA FOR MANY YEARS THEY WORK HARD 
FOR THEIR REPUTATION 
WHER THEY ARE 
IN CUBA THEY WORK EVERY DAY THEY 
REHEARSE FROM ZERO ZERO ZERO A M. TO THREE HUNDRED P. M. IN 
THE AFTERNOON HERE IT'S REHEARSALS 
EVERY DAY TO KEEP THEM TRIM AND 
SUPPLE BUT I THINK IT'S MAINLY 
ENTHUSIASM THAT KEEPS THEM GOING 
THESE FOURTEEN DANCERS HAVE BEEN PART OF 
HAVANA RAKATAN FOR FIVE YEARS 
THEIR RANGE OF EXPERIENCE AND DANCE 
STYLES INCORPORATE THE ROOT OF 
CUBAN TRADITION 
THEIR PREVIOUS TRIP TO LONDON WAS A 
FIVE WEEK RESIDENCEY AT SAD LETTERS 
WELL WELL LAST ADD LETTERS WELLS L. WAS 
EXPECTING A DEDICATED DANCE CROWD 
WE HAD CHILDREN TEENAGER 
PROFESSIONAL OAPS YOU NAME IT WE 
HAD EVERYONE 
WE THREW A LONDON 
SALSA FANATIC INTO IT ROBERT HAS 
BEEN TEACHING IT ALL OVER THE 
CAPITAL AFTER CATCHING THE BUG 
IT'S LIKE LONDON HAS BEEN 
INFESTED THERE IS FIVE OR SIX GOOD 
CLUBS TO GO TO EVERY DAY AND ABOUT 
FIVE OR SIX FAIRLY GOOD CLUBS ALL 
AROUND LONDON EVERY DAY 
ROBERT DID 
WELL TO KEEP UP WITH THE ENERGY OF 
THE CUBAN VISITORS A AS A 
ENTHUSIAST WHAT DID HE MAKE OF THE 
SHOW THERE A LOT ABOUT THE SHOW HISTORY OF SALSA GOING ON IN THERE 
IT DOESN'T REALLY MAT WHAER THAT IS

LARGE STAY DRY THIS BAND OF CLOUD 
FURTHER NORTH ACROSS THE U. K. THAT

WE WILL GET THE COLDER AIR FOR THE 
TIME BEING IT'S STILL RELATIVELY 
MILD FORDS FORCE LATER IN THE 
NIGHT THE CLOUD COULD THICKEN UP 
ONE OR TWO SPOTS OF RAIN BUT 
GENERALLY IT WILL STAY DRY IT WILL 
FEEL COLDER TOMORROW COULD WELL BE 
A BIT OF SUNSHINE TOMORROW THAT 
CLOUD WILL BRING RAIN FOR A TIME 
THEN THE AFTERNOON SHOULD BRIGHTEN 
UP AGAIN WITH SUNSHINE AND THE RISK

NOTICE IS THAT DROP IN TEMPERATURES 
THROUGHOUT THE WEEK WE HAVE BEEN IN 
THE MIDTO HIGH TEENS JUST TEN OR ELEVEN 
CELSIUS TOMORROW THROUGH THE 
COURSE OF SATURDAY EVENING THE 
SHOWERS SHOULD FADE AWAY LATER IN 
NIGHT WE COULD GET SLEET AND SNOW

MELT IT
