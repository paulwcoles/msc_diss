REID THE EASY LIFE PRISON OFFICERS SAY INMATES ARE SO COMFY 
IN JAIL THEY DON'T WANT TO ESCAPE 
GOOD MORNING IT IS FRIDAY TWENTY FIFTH 
APRIL ALSO AHEAD THIS MORNING 
HOLLYWOOD STAR WESLEY SNIPS IS 
GIVEN THREE YEARS IN JAIL FOR 
FAILING TO PAY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
IN TAXES AND THE C. I. A. ACCUSES NORTH 
KOREA OF HELPING SYRIA TO BUILD A 
NUCLEAR PLANT 
AND RANGERS' HOPES ARE STILL ALIVE 
OF PICKING UP FOUR TROPHIES THIS 
SEASON AND I'LL BE AT ONE OF THE 
BEST VIEWS IN BRITAIN AS 
NORTHUMBERLAND ENVEILS ITS NEW 
OBSERVATORY AND A WEATHER FORECAST 
IN FIFTEEN MINUTES 
A SENIOR PRISON OFFICER SAYS 
INMATES ARE SO COMFORTABLE IN JAIL 
THEY DON'T WANT TO ESCAPE THE 
ASSISTANT CHIEF OF THE PRISON 
OFFICERS ASSOCIATION SAYS THEY ARE 
HAPPY BECAUSE THEY CAN GET HOLD OF 
DRUGS MOBILE PHONES AND 
PROSTITUTES PROSTITUTES IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT 
PRISONERS ARE ACCUSED OF LEADING 
CUSHY LIVES BUT THIS IS THE FIRST 
TIME THAT THEY ARE SAYING IT IS SO 
GOOD THEY DON'T WANT THE CHANCE TO 
LEAVE LEAVE IT IS SO GOOD THAT ONE MAN BROKE IN 
TO THE PRISON TO SUPPLY THE 
PRISONERS WITH DRUGS AND OTHER 
GOODS GOODS HE SAID HE ALSO CLAIMS THERE HAVE BEEN 
SIMILAR INCIDENTS IN OTHER JAILS 
THERE WAS EVEN AN ATTEMPT AT ONE 
PRISON TO SMUGGLE IN PROSTITUTES 
MR. TRAVIS THINKS A SHORTAGE OF 
PRISON OFFICERS AND RELAXED REGIMES 
ARE TO BLAME THE PRISON SERVICE 
HAS RESPONDED TO THE SECURITY 
BREACH AT THE PRISON SAYING IT 
BECAME AWARE IN JANUARY AND IT TOOK 
IMMEDIATE ACTION BY MOVING THE 
FORMER GOVERNOR TO A NEW ROLE IT 
SAYS AT NO TIME WERE PRISONERS OUT 
OF THEIR CELLS 
THE HOLLYWOOD ACTOR WESLEY SNIPES 
SNIPS HAS BEEN STSED TO THREE YEARS 
IN SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS IN 
PRISON FOR TAX EVASION OUR 
CORRESPONDENT ANDY CALLAGHER IS IN 
MIAMI FOR US THIS MORNING ANDY 
THIS IS A CASE THAT HAS BEEN IN AND 
OUT OF THE FLORIDA COURT ROOMS FOR 
SEVERAL YEARS AT THE HEART OF IT 
WESLEY SNIPES' DECISION THAT THE U. S. 
GOVERNMENT HAD NO LEGAL RIGHT TO 
TAKE TAXES FROM HIM 
HEADING INTO COURT TO FACE CHARGES 
OF TAX EVASION WESLEY SNIPES 
OFFERS WAITING PHOTOGRAPHERS A 
PEACE SIGN AND THEN A SILENT 
PRAYER BUT ONCE INSIDE THE 
HOLLYWOOD STAR'S PRAYERS FELL ON 
DEAF AREAS AND THEN HE WAS 
SENTENCED TO PRISON HE WRONGLY 
THOUGHT THAT THE U. S. GOVERNMENT HAD 
NO LEGAL RIGHT TO ASK FOR THE MONEY 
YOU'VE GOT TO PAY YOUR TAXES IF 
YOU DISPUTE IT CONTACT THE I. R. S. AND 
GO THROUGH TO THE FORMAL PROCESS 
BUT TO CONTINUALLY SAY I DON'T 
OWE TAXES YOU HAVE TO SHOW ME WHY 
I DO IT'S LUDICROUS 
THE ACTOR 
WAS IN MANY FILMS AND HIS PLIGHT 
BROUGHT MANY LETTERS TO THE COURT 
FROM FELLOW ACTORS WHICH TALKED OF 
HIS GOOD CHARACTER BUT THE JUDGE 
SAID HE SHOWED A HISTORY OF KEMPT 
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME READING FROM 
A STATEMENT IN COURT THE STAR 
APOLOGISED FOR HIS COSTLY MISTAKES 
SAYING HE WAS NAIVE AND UNSCHOOLED 
IN THE LAW OF FINANCE IT SETS AN 
EXAMPLE TO THE REST OF AMERICA AND 
SOME SEE HIS SENTENCE AS HARSH FOR 
NOW WESLEY SNIPES IS A FREE MAN 
BUT SOON HE WILL HAVE TO BEGIN A 
SENTENCE THAT WILL LEAVE HIS CAREER 
IN RUNTS 
SO A HARSH SENTENCE 
PERHAPS RUINS BUT FOR THE U. S. 
GOVERNMENT IS SEEING IT AS A 
VICTORY THE MESSAGE IS THAT NO 
MATTER HOW BIG OR RICH A STAR YOU 
ARE IF YOU DON'T PAY YOUR TAXES 
YOU COULD FACE GOING TO JAIL 
POLICE ARE CONTINUING TO QUESTION 
TWO PEOPLE ABOUT THE MURDER OF 
JAMES HUGHES THE SEVERELY DISABLED 
MAN WHOSE BODY WAS DISCOVERED AT 
HIS HOME IN REDDITCH ON WEDNESDAY 
ONE OF THOSE BEING QUESTIONED IT 
IS UNDERSTOOD IS THE PARTNER OF 
HIS MOTHER HEATHER WARDLE WHOSE 
BODY WAS FOUND ON MONDAY 
AMERICA HAS ACCUSED NORTH KOREA OF 
HELPING SYRIANS TO BUILD A NUCLEAR 
PLANT WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN 
DESTROYED BY ISRAELI WARPLANES 
SYRIA HAS DISMISSED THE ACCUSATIONS 
AS RIDICULOUS 
AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE SAY THESE 
PICTURES SHOW NUCLEAR PLANT VETLY 
BEING BUILT IN THE SYRIAN DESERT 
AND ON TOP OF THE IMAGES AN 
UNIDENTIFIED VOICE POINTS OUT 
SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS IN NORTH KOREA 
USED FOR CREATING NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
AND ON THE RIGHT THE ALLEGED HEAD 
OF SYRIA'S NUCLEAR PROGRAMME 
STANDING BESIDE HIS NORTH KOREAN'S 
COUNTERPART COUNTERPART FINALLY FROM THE SKY THE PLANT IS 
SHOWN DESTROYED THE ATTACKS 
CARRIED OUT BY ISRAELI WARPLANES 
LAST SEPTEMBER EVEN THEN THE C. I. A. 
CLAIMS THAT BOTH NORTH KOREA AND 
SYRIA TRIED TO COVER UP THE AREA 
WHICH HUGE TARPAULIN SHEETS SYRIA 
SAYS IT IS ALL FANTASY THE WHITE 
HOUSE SAYS IT IS CONVINCED THAT 
NORTH KOREA WAS HELPING SYRIA TO 
BUILD A SECRET NUCLEAR FACILITY 
BUT THEN THERE ARE QUESTIONS LIKE 
WHY RELEASE THIS SENSITIVE 
INTELLIGENCE JUST NOW WHAT EFFECTS 
FOUR IT HAVE ON NORTH KOREA TO GIVE UP 
ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAMME AND IS THIS 
A WARNING TO IRAN 
FRESH EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO 
PERSUADE MOTORISTS IN SCOTLAND TO 
AVOID PANIC BUYING OF FUEL 
FOLLOWING THE STRIKE DUE AT 
GRANGEMOUTH THEY BEGAN CLOSING 
DOWN THE GRAJ MOUTH REFINERY ON 
MONDAY AN OPERATION THAT WILL BE 
COMPLETED ON SATURDAY IT SUPPLIES 
MOST OF SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND 
AND PARTS OF NORTHERN ENGLAND 
IT HAS RESULTED IN SHORTAGES AT THE 
PUMPS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS 
THE QUEUES HAVE BEEN BIG TODAY THE THE LIMIT IS TWENTY A GO SO THAT'S QUITE 
FAIR ISN'T IT 
PEOPLE ARE TAKING 
IT EASY AND IT'S NOT TOO BAD FOR FOR THE MOST PART MOTORISTS APPEAR TO 
HAVE HEEDED CALLS NOT TO INDULGE IN 
PANIC BUYING MINISTERS SAY THERE 
IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FUEL IN THE 
SYSTEM TO LAST UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF 
NEXT MONTH BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS 
THAT A SHUTDOWN COULD DISRUPT 
SUPPLIES TO A NEIGHBOURING B. P. PLANT 
WHICH COLLECTS ALMOST A THIRD OF 
THE U. K.'S CRUDE OIL FROM THE NORTH 
SEA 
IF THOSE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND BARRELS A DAY SEA WERE TO BE SHUT IN THAT IS A LOSS 
TO THE NATION OF ABOUT FIFTY MILLION 
A DAY THAT IS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT 
UPON THE NATION AND OF THAT OVER 
ONE MILLION AN HOUR IS PAID IN TAX 
THE WORKERS AT GRANGEMOUTH HAVE 
GONE ON STRIKE BECAUSE OF THE 
COMPANY'S PLANS TO ALTER THEIR 
FINAL PENSION SCHEME TALKS IN 
LONDON BROKE DOWN EARLIER THIS WEEK 
WE'LL BE ASKING OIL ANALYST NICK 
MCGREGOR HOW THE DISPUTE MIGHT 
AFFECT FUEL SUPPLIES AROUND THE 
COUNTRY JUST AFTER SIX HUNDRED THIRTY AIR 
ACCIDENT INVESTIGATORS HAVE 
RELEASED THE LAST WORDS RECORDED BY 
THE CREW OF THE PLANE THAT CRASHED 
INTO HOUSE IN KENT LAST MONTH 
THE CESSNA CITATION CAME DOWN CLOSE 
TO BIGGIN HILL AIRPORT AND ALL ON 
BOARD WERE KILLED S. N. P. 
A STUDY SUGGESTS THAT A HIGH 
PERCENTAGE OF GIRLS WILL BE 
VACCINATED WITH THE JAB AGAINST 
CERVICAL CANCER LATER THIS YEAR 
DESPITE WARNINGS THAT IT COULD 
ENCOURAGE PROMISCUITY 
A TWO YEAR OLD BRITISH MAN HAS BEEN 
KILLED ON THE NOTORIOUS HIGHWAY OF 
DEATH IN BOLIVIA EIGHT PEOPLE 
INSIDE A VEHICLE WERE ALSO KILLED 
IN THE CRASH 
THE B. B. C. HAS REVEALED THAT ONE OF 
BRITAIN'S BIGGEST POLICE FORCES IS 
LOOK AT ALL THE REJECTED 
APPLICATIONS FOR WORK FROM ETHNIC 
PEOPLE TO SEE IF THEY HAVE BEEN 
UNFAIRLY REJECTED 
FROM MATERIAL GIRL TO MALAWI 
AMBASSADOR MADONNA TOOK TO THE RED 
CARPET IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT TO 
PREMIERE HER FILM AM BECAUSE WE 
ARE SHOWS THE PLIGHT OF MANY 
CHILDREN IN MALAWI WHO ARE ORPHANED 
BECAUSE OF AIDS 
MADONNA AT THE FILM FESTIVAL AND IN 
TOWN TO PROMOTE HER IN DOCUMENTARY 
HOW DO WE PREVENT THIS NEXT 
GENERATION OF CHILDREN FROM 
REPEATING HISTORY 
IT IS A STARK LOOK AT MALAWI'S 
ESTIMATED ONE MILLION ORPHANS 
MOSTLY CHILDREN WHOSE MOTHERS HAVE 
DIED FROM AIDS IT CONTAINS 
MESSAGE OF OBLIGATION 
WE ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR EACH OTHER AND IF 
WE CAN HELP IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR 
FORM THEN WE SHOULD 
THE FILM 
ARRIVES ASTHMA DONNA AWAITS THE 
FINAL ADOPTION FOR HER MALAWIIAN 
BOY BOY THIS COULD BE SEEN AS PART OF A 
PUBLIC RELATIONS EXERCISE TO SOFTEN 
SOFTEN UP CRITICS FROM SEEING HER 
AS AN EXCELLENT ADOPTIVE LIFE 
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME KWHR I CHOSE 
MALAWI AND I TELL THEM I DIDN'T 
IT CHOSE ME I WAS NOT IN THE FILM 
AT ALL BUT I REALISED BECAUSE I 
WAS NARRATING IT IT WAS IMPORTANT 
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW IT WAS MY 
PERSONAL JOURNEY 
MADONNA'S EFFORTS 
ARE BEING SAID TO BE LAUDABLE 
BRINGING ATTENTION TO A CRISIS THAT 
MUCH OF THE WORLD IGNORES 
THOSE ARE THIS MARK'S TOP STORIES 
WHICH MEAN IT IS IS TIME TO SURN TO 
SUE FOR ALL THE SPORT 
TSHTSH TURN GOOD MORNING 
IF RANGERS ARE TO WIN A QUADRUPLE 
THIS SEASON THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE 
TO DO IT THE HARD WAY 
THEY COULD ONLY MANAGE A GOALLESS 
DRAW IN THE FIRST LEG OF THEIR UEFA 
CUP SEMI FINAL AGAINST FIORENTINA 
LAST NIGHT 
THE ITALIANS HAVE BECOME THE 
SEVENTH EUROPEAN SIDE THIS SEASON 
WHO HAVE FAILED TO SCORE AT IBROX 
CRICKET COULD OVERTAKE FOOTBALL AS 
THE WORLD'S LEADING SPORT 
THAT'S THE VIEW OF SIR ALLEN 
STANFORD STANFORD THE TEXAN BILLIONAIRE HAS BEEN 
TALKING TO THE ENGLAND AND WALES 
CRICKET BOARD ABOUT INVESTING IN A 
T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY COMPETITION TO RIVAL THE 
INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE WHICH HE 
BELIEVES COULD BE WORTH AT LEAST ONE DOLLAR 
BILLION BILLION NOVAK DJOKOVIC SAYS ANDY MURRAY 
NEEDS TO START BEING MORE 
AGGRESSIVE ON CLAY 
THE WORLD NUMBER THREE KNOCKED THE 
BRITISH NUMBER ONE OUT OF THE MONTE 
CARLO MASTERS IN STRAIGHT SETS SIX TO ZERO 
SIX TO FOUR HIS FOURTH STRAIGHT VICTORY 
OVER THE BRITISH NUMBER ONE 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HAS APOLOGISED 
FOR LEWD COMMENTS HE MADE AT THE 
CHINA OPEN LAST MONTH 
THE TWO TIME WINNER OF THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS SPOKE OUT AFTER 
REACHING THE SECOND ROUND IN 
SHEFFIELD WITH A TEN TO FIVE VICTORY OVER 
CHINESE TEENAGER LIU CHANG 
AND IN THE PAPERS THIS MORNING I 
SUPPOSE IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT A 
COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THE CHELSEA 
MATCH REISS IS BEGINNING TO GET A 
SENSE OF HUMOUR OVER HIS OWN GOAL 
WITH THIS CARTOON BUBBLE SAYING 
HEY MY GOAL WAS BETTER THAN 
YOURS BUT IT WAS A HORRIBLE WAY 
TO END A MATCH AND A HORRIBLE WAY 
FOR A PLAYER TO SCORE LIKE THAT 
AND THE REST OF THE PAPERS THE 
DAILY EXPRESS HAS THE PICTURE OF 
THE TWO HUNDRED TO ONE MILLION CHANCE OF HAVING 
IDENTICAL TRIPLETS 
AND THE LEAD STORY ONE THE LUXURY 
LIFE IN OUR JAILS THE STORY WE'RE 
DOING THIS MORNING ABOUT DRUGS SO 
CHEAP AND INMATES SMUGGLING THEM 
OUT OF THE JAIL TO SELL AND THE 
DAILY TELEGRAPH IS ALSO LEADING 
WITH THAT STORY THIS MORNING THAT 
INMATES ARE ENJOYING SUCH 
COMFORTABLE TIMES IN JAIL THEY 
DON'T WANT TO ESCAPE AND A PICTURE 
OF GWYNETH PALTROW IN AN EXTREMELY 
SHORT SKIRT 
AND THE GUARDIAN SAYS THAT FACE 
SCANNERS WILL BE USED THIS SUMMER 
AS YOU GO THROUGH THE AIRPORT 
THERE WILL BE A SPECIAL AREA 
UNMANNED THAT WILL MATCH THE 
PICTURE IN YOUR PASSPORT TO A 
SPECIAL IMAGE AND IT LOOKS LIKE 
THIS SO THAT COULD BE TRIED THIS 
SUMMER SUMMER AND THE TIMES BRITAIN FACES A WAVE 
OF UNREST THIS SUMMER AS MILLIONS 
OF MEMBERS OF UNIONS COULD GO ON 
STRIKE ACTION 
IT WAS A CHICKEN THAT DIDN'T STOP 
GROWING SCIENTISTS HAVE TAKEN 
SPECIAL SAMPLES AND ANALYSED THEM 
WITH A MASS SPECK TROM TER AND THEY 
ARE SAYING THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN 
A CHICKEN AND A T. REX 
YOU SEE I CAN SEE THE LINK 
YOU THINK THEY LOOK SIMILAR 
IT HAS 
A LOOK NECK AND TINY NED AND THOSE 
HEAD AND THOSE CLAWS 
LOOK AT THE TRIPLETS NOT JUST 
TRIPLETS EYE IDENTICAL TRIPLETS

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM

LOOK AT THIS A MASSIVE VIEW OF THE 
WORLD AS NIGHT FALLS THE GLOWING 
AREAS ARE THOSE WITH THE MOST LIGHT 
POLLUTION AND AS YOU CAN SEE 
ENGLAND IS ONE OF THE WORST 
AFFECTED COUNTRIES IN EUROPE THERE 
ARE PATCHES OF RELIEF FOR STARGAZER 
AND RAYMOND BUCHANAN IS IN ONE OF 
THEM THAT'S ENGLAND'S DARKEST 
PLACE KIELDER FOREST IN 
NORTHUMBERLAND RAYMOND IT IS 
LOOKING MISTY THERE MAYBE FOGGY 
INDEED BUT YOU HAVE TO AGREE IT 
HAS STUNNING VIEWS IN THE DAYLIGHT 
KIELDER FOREST ATTRACTS VISITORS

DAYLIGHT BUT IT ALSO ATTRACTS 
LOT OF OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO 
STARGAZE BECAUSE IT HAS HAS SO 
LITTLE LIGHT POLLUTION LOOK AROUND 
ME THERE ARE MILE UPON MILE UPON 
MILE OF OPEN COUNTRYSIDE NO

NO FACTORIES EMITING MAN MADE LIGHT 
UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THIS IS ONE 
OF THE FINEST PLACES IN ENGLAND TO 
LOOK AT THE STARS AND THERE ARE 
MANY STARGAZERS HERE AND THEY ARE 
DELIGHTED THEY HAVE THIS IT MAY 
NOT LOOK THAT MUCH COMPARED TO NASA 
OBSERVATORIES BUT THE STARGAZERS 
ARE DELIGHTEDMENT THIS PLACE IS 
KNOWN FOR ITS GOOD VIEWS OF THE 
STARS AND OF THE UNIVERSE AND THEY 
BELIEVE THIS OBSERVATORY WILL MAKE 
THE VIEWS BETTER 
ERNIE SMITH LEFT THE BRIGHT LIGHTS 
OF NEWCASTLE FOR THE CLEAR SKIES OF 
KIELDER FOREST WELL BECAUSE HE IS 
AN AMSTER ASTRONOMER AND THIS IS 
THE PLACE TO BE 
I REALLY LEFT THERE BECAUSE OF ALL 
THE LIGHT POLLUTION IT IS 
UNBELIEVABLE THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT 
POLLUTION IN THE CITY AND I LOVE 
THE DARK SKIES AND THIS IS A 
PERFECT AREA FOR DARK SKIES 
ITS LANDSCAPE IS BEGUILING AND 
BEAUTIFUL BY DAY BUT THE DELIGHTS 
ARE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR WHEN NIGHT 
FALLS THIS IS ENGLAND'S DARKEST 
PLACE AND ITS BEST VIEW ON OTHER 
WORLDS WORLDS BEFORE TODAY VISITORS HAD TO RELY 
ON THE NAKED EYE TO STARGAZE NO 
MORE THIS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OBSERVATORY 
WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ITS RARE 
POSITION ALLOWING ASTRONOMERS TO 
ENDULLGE THEIR PASSION 
WE HAVE CHANCE TO MAKE 
DISCOVERIES ALL ASTRONOMERS COME 
TO PLACE LIKE THIS WE HAVE THE 
INSTRUMENTATION AND THE DARK SKIES 
AND WE HAVE FACILITY THAT WE CAN 
MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO REAL SCIENCE SCIENCE SITED ABOVE KIELDER FOREST IT IS 
HOPED THAT IT WILL HELP PEOPLE 
ENCOURAGE THE NIGHT SKY

OBSERVATORY WHENEVER THEY WANTED 
HERE IS A TASTER THESE IMAGES 
TAKEN AT KIELDER FOREST SHOW WHAT 
MANY IN ENGLAND ARE MISSING OUT 
AWAY FROM THE GLARE OF TOWNS AND 
CITIES A SHOW THAT IS LITERALLY 
OUT OF THIS WORLD

MANY PEOPLE OVER THIS WEEKEND TO 
SEE THE SIGHTS THEY WILL BE 
HOLDING OPEN DAYS HERE HERE TRYING 
TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED AND 
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTAS OF 
THE VISTAS ONLY THE NETHERLANDS 
HAS A WORSE PROBLEM WITH LIGHT 
POLLUTION IN THE WHOLE OF EUROPE 
THIS HAS BEEN A SUBJECT WHICH HAS 
BEEN DEBATED OVER THE LAST FEW 
YEARS IF YOU WANT YOUR COMMUNITY 
TO HAVE A BETTER VIEW OF THE 
UNIVERSE IF YOU HAVE OUTSIDE 
LIGHTS TILT THEM SO THEY ARE 
FACING DOWN AND NOT EMITING LIGHT 
UPWARDS IF YOU ARE REPLACING 
OUTSIDE LIGHTS TRY TO GET THEM WITH 
HIGH PRESSURE SODIUM LIGHTS RATHER 
THAN LOW PRESSURE SODIUM LIGHTS IF 
YOU DO THAT THEN PERHAPS OTHER 
PART OFENING GLAND COULD SHARE IN 
THE DELIGHTS OF THE UNIVERSE WHICH 
THEY FIND HERE IN NORTHUMBERLAND 
THANK YOU YOU WOULDN'T OF THOUGHT 
THE NETHERLANDS WOULD BE THE WORST 
IN EUROPE WOULD YOU

IN A T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY COMPETITION TO RIVAL 
THE INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE WHICH HE 
BELIEVES COULD BE WORTH AT LEAST 
ONE DOLLAR BILLION ONE DOLLAR BILLION HE'S ALREADY OFFERED TO PUT UP TEN 
MILLION AS PRIZE FOR A SERIES OF 
MATCHES BETWEEN ENGLAND AND HIS ALL 
STAR SIDE BUT HE BELIEVES THAT'S 
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG FOR THE 
SPORT 
THE ENGLISH CLEARLY HAVE TO MAKE A 
DECISION AND I THINK THEY'LL MAKE 
THE DECISION TO TAKE CONTROL AND 
RUN WITH THIS OR OUR FRIENDS TO 
THE EAST ARE THE NINE HUNDRED POUND 
GORILLA AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING 
THIS 
ANDY MURRAY IS OUT OF THE MONTE 
CARLO MASTERS AFTER STRAIGHT SETS 
DEFEAT TO NOVAK DJOKOVIC 
ON HIS LEAST FAVOURITE SURFACE 
MURRAY GOT OFF TO DREADFUL START 
FAILING TO WIN SINGLE GAME IN THE 
OPENING SET 
HE DID MANAGE TO BREAK THE WORLD 
NUMBER THREE IN THE SECOND BUT 
DJOKOVIC BROKE STRAIGHT BACK AND 
BROKE MURRAY AGAIN TO LOVE TO TAKE 
THE MATCH 
THE SCOT STILL HASN'T BEATEN 
DJOKOVIC IN FOUR ATTEMPTS 
DOUBLE WORLD CHAMPION RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HAS OFFERED TO WITHDRAW 
FROM FUTURE SNOOKER EVENTS IN CHINA 
IN CASE OF FURTHER EMBARRASSMENT TO 
TOURNAMENT ORGANISERS 
THE THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD FACES DISCIPLINARY 
ACTION AFTER SERIES OF LEWD 
COMMENTS AND ANTICS AT LAST MONTH'S 
CHINA OPEN BUT HAS NOW PUBLICLY 
APOLOGISED APOLOGISED O'SULLIVAN EASED THROUGH HIS FIRST 
ROUND MATCH AT THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS IN SHEFFIELD BEATING 
CHINESE TEENAGER LIU CHANG TEN TO FIVE 
IT SETS UP SECOND ROUND MEETING 
WITH ANOTHER TWO TIME WINNER 
WELSHMAN MARK WILLIAMS 
THAT'S ALL THE SPORT FOR NOW MORE 
IN AN HOUR'S TIME 
IF THERE IS NO PANIC THERE WILL BE 
NO PROBLEM THAT IS THE MESSAGE 
FROM PETROL STATIONS AHEAD OF THIS 
WEEKEND'S PLANNED STRIKE AT THE 
GRANGEMOUTH OIL REFINERY IT SERVES 
MOST OF SCOTLAND PARTS OF NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND NORTHERN ENGLAND SO 
HOW WORRIED SHOULD WE BE LET'S ASK 
NICK MCGREGOR AN OIL ANALYST 
SHOULD MOTORISTS BE WORRIED NO NO THERE COULD BE A FEW HICCUPS AS 
PEOPLE TRY TO DELIVER RESERVES TO 
PLACES AT THE RIGHT TIME WE'RE WE'RE HEARING THAT AT SOME RURAL PETROL 
STATIONS THEY ARE SELLING OUT AS 
PEOPLE FILL UP THEIR TANKS THAT'S 
NOT A NORMAL SITUATION 
IS IT IT IT IS NOT ABNORMAL BEARING IN MIND 
THERE IS VERY LITTLE MONEY IN 
PETROL RETAILING THESE DAYS SO 
THEY DON'T TEND TO FILL UP THAT 
FREQUENTLY AND IT IS KNOWN THEY 
CAN RUN OUT 
SO AS LONG AS PEOPLE 
DON'T PANIC IT WILL BE FINE WHERE 
IS THE FUEL COMING FROM IF NOT 
GRANGEMOUTH FOR THAT SHORT PERIOD 
OF TIME 
THERE ARE FUEL DEPOTS AND 
SUPPLIERS IN SCOTLAND JUST NOT 
REFINERIES AND THERE ARE LARGE 
ONES IN TEESSIDE FOR EXAMPLE SO 
THE FUEL IS THERE IT IS JUST 
GETTING IT TO THE RIGHT PLACES BUT 
THERE ARE PLANS IN PLACE THAT 
ALWAYS ENVISAGED SOMEWHERE LIKE 
GRANGEMOUTH BEING OUT OF ACTION 
ONCE THE STRIKE IS OVER HOW LONG 
BEFORE IT GETS BACK TO NORMAL AND 
NORMAL SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION IS 
RESUMED 
THE OWNERS OF THE SITE SAY RESUMED IT COULD BE ANYTHING UP TO THREE 
WEEKS TO GET THE SITE UP AND 
RUNNING AGAIN THAT IS FAIRLY 
UNTESTED IN THE WHOLE EIGHTY YEAR 
HISTORY THIS SITE HAS NEVER BEEN 
SHUT DOWN IN ITS ENTIRETY SO 
NOBODY IS QUITE SURE 
SO IF IT IS 
THREE WEEKS BEFORE IT IS UP AND 
RUNNING AGAIN CAN PEOPLE BE 
CONFIDENT THE SUPPLY IS THERE EVEN EVEN IF THERE IS NO PRODUCTION FOR TWO 
WEEKS BUT WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT 
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ONLY TWO 
DAYS OF NON PRODUCTION AND THEN IT 
WILL BE OPENED AGAIN THERE IS A 
SUPPLY IN RESERVE 
HE ONE BEST KNOWN AS THE STAR OF 
ACTION MOVIES BUT THE AMERICAN 
ACTOR WESLEY SNIPES IS NOW CENTRE 
STAGE IN REAL LIFE DRAMA HE IS 
GOING TO JAIL FOR THREE YEARS HE 
WAS SENT TO PRISON BY A JUDGE IN 
FLORIDA FOR TRYING TO AVOID PAYING 
MORE THAN FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TAXES OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IS IN FLORIDA FOR US 
THIS MORNING THREE YEARS SOUNDS 
HARSH PENALTY FOR TAX AVOIDANCE 
CAN YOU TELL US MORE 
I THINK IT IS 
A FAIRLY HARSH SENTENCE AND HE HAD 
NO PREVIOUS RECORD BUT WHAT WE'RE 
SEEING HERE IS THE AMERICAN TAX 
COLLECTING AGENCY MAKING AN EXAMPLE 
OF A POWERFUL MAN A STAR IN 
HOLLYWOOD AND SOMEONE WHO IS RICH 
AND AT THE HEART OF THIS IS WESLEY 
SNIPES'S DECISION OR BELIEF THAT 
THE U. S. GOVERNMENT HAD NO LEGAL 
RIGHT TO TAKE TAXES FROM HIM HE 
SAID IN COURT HE WAS NAIVE AND HAD 
NO UNDERSTANDING OF LEGAL OR 
FINANCIAL MATTERS HE IS FREE AT 
THE MOMENT BUT WILL HAVE TO TURN 
HIMSELF INTO THE AUTHORITIES OVER 
THE NEXT THREE WEEKS AND START THAT 
THREE YEAR SENTENCE 
I UNDERSTAND 
ONE OF THE THINGS HE DID DURING THE 
COURT PROCESS WAS THAT HE BROUGHT 
IN LETTERS OF SUPPORT FROM OTHER 
ACTORS 
HE HAD TWO LETTERS ONE ACTORS FROM DENZEL WASHINGTON AND ONE FROM 
WOODY HARRELSON DENZIL WASHINGTON 
CALLED HIM A MIGHTY OCCASION HE 
SAID HE HAD BEEN BADLY ADVISED BUT 
THIS IS A CASE THAT HAS BEEN IN AND 
OUT OF THE COURT FOR YEARS AND HE 
DIDN'T WANT TO PAY HIS TAXES AND HE 
HAS PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE 
THE MAIN STORIES THIS MORNING A 
SENIOR PRISONSTER SAYS MANY INMATES 
ARE SO COMFORTABLE IN JAIL THEY 
DON'T WANT TO ESCAPE AND HOLLYWOOD 
STAR WESLEY SNIPES IS JAILED FOR 
THREE YEARS IN FLORIDA FOR FAILING 
TO PAY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAXES 
ALSO COMING UP MAKE DO AND MEND 
WE'LL LOOK AT WHY SEWING MACHINES 
ARE MAKING A COMEBACK 
IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR A CHANGE IN THE 
WEATHER MATT IS IT HAPPENING 
OH THAT'S TOUGH YES FOR SOME IT 
WILL BE A SUNNY TIME BUT ALL OF US 
WILL SEE RAIN AT SOME PINT BUT 
THERE WILL BE BRIGHTER MOMENTS TO 
ENJOY TODAY IT WILL BE FIVE DRY 
START TO THE DAY ACROSS THE BULK OF 
THE U. K. AND BRIGHT ACROSS EASTERN 
PARTS OF BRITAIN BUT GLOOMIER AND 
GREYER TO THE WEST 
THERE YOU CAN SEE THAT CLOUD 
PUSHING UP FROM THE MID ATLANTIC 
WHICH IS STARTING TO BRING FEW 
SPITS OF RAIN TO NORTHERN IRELAND 
AND THE FRINGES OF WALES AND THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND IN THE NEXT 
FEW HOURS AND THAT WILL PUSH INTO 
THE REST OF WALES AND THE NORTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND AND EVENTUALLY 
SCOTLAND SCOTLAND OVER TO THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY IT 
WILL BE CLOUDY AND BECOME DAMP BY 
THIS AFTER ENGINE 
AND ACROSS THE CUMBRIAN FELLS SOME 
OF THE RAIN WILL BE HEAVY BUT FROM 
SHEFFIELD SOUTHWARDS WE'RE LOOKING 
AT A DECENT AMOUNT OF DRY WEATHER 
BUT IT WILL BE CLOUDY WITH ONLY ONE 
OR TWO BREAKS 
FOR MOST OF US IT WILL BE A CLOUDY 
DAY AND TO THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND AND THE SOUTH WEST OF WALES 
THERE WILL BE RAIN AND DRIZZLE 
AND A BREEZY NIGHT IN THE WEST BUT 
IT WILL BE MILD NIGHT AND IN THE 
NORTH RAIN FOR THE MORNING TOMORROW 
BUT THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE 
COUNTRY SHOULD BE DRY BRIGHT AND 
WARM WITH TEMPERATURES PEAKING AT 
TWENTY ONE CELSIUS SEVENTY ONE FAHRENHEIT 
ON SUNDAY THE WET WEATHER IN THE 
WEST WILL PUSH EASTWARDS THROUGH 
THE 
DAY AND IT WILL BE MISERABLE DAY IN PARTS OF CENTRAL ENGLAND AND 
EASTERN SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN 
IRELAND WILL HAVE THE BEST OF THE 
WEATHER AND THE WINDS SHOULD BE 
MUCH LIGHTER BUT IT IS STILL VERY 
MILD WITH TEMPERATURES UP TO THIRTEEN OR 
SEVENTEEN DEGREES 
DOESN'T THE BLOSSOM LOOK LOVELY 
YES AND A LOOK AT THE FRONT PAGES 
NOW THE INDEPENDENT PAY UP IS 
THE BIG STORY HERE THIS IS ABOUT 
THE UNFAIR CHARGES BANKS HAVE BEEN 
CHARGING THEY SAY AND THE HIGH 
COURT HAS NOW RULED THAT THE OFFICE 
OF FAIR TRADING CAN CARRY ON 
INVESTIGATING THE PROCESS IT 
DOESN'T MEAN THAT AT THIS STAGE THE 
BANKS HAVE TO PAY UP BUT THEY 
COULD BE INVESTED SOMETHING WE'LL 
BE TALKING ABOUT LATER ON THIS 
PROGRAMME PROGRAMME AND THE EXPRESS HAS THE PICTURE OF 
THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONE CHANCE OF HAVING 
IDENTICAL TRIPLETS AND LOOK AT 
THEM THEY ARE ALL GIRLSMENT 
AND THE DAILY MIRROR HAS THE STORY 
ABOUT JAMES HUGHES AND THE 
SUGGESTION THAT HIS BODY COULD HAVE 
BEEN LEFT IN A SUITCASE AND PICKED 
UP IN THE SUN YES JAMES IN A 
SUITCASE FOR THREE MONTHS AND THE 
TELEGRAPH'S MAIN PICTURE STORY IS 
GWYNETH PALTROW AT THE OPENING OF 
HER NEW MOVIE IRON MAN IN WHAT 
MANY PAPERS ARE COMMENTING ON IS 
VERY MINISKIRT 
AND THE STORY THAT THE PRISONS ARE 
SO CUSHY INMATES DON'T WANT TO 
ESCAPE ESCAPE AND UNIONS ARE GEARING UP FOR A 
SUMMER OF UNREST ACCORDING TO THE 
TIMES THIS MORNING UNIONS ARE 
BALLOTING FOR STRIKE ACTION OVER 
PAY THIS IS FOR HEALTH WORKERS AND 
CIVIL SERVANTS AND LET'S LOOK AT 
THOSE LITTLE TRIPLETS OH THEY'RE 
SO CUTE 
THEY ARE VERY CUTE BABIES 
AND THEIR MUM IS A MIDWIFE AND THE 
CHANCES OF IDENTICAL TRIPLETS ARE 
TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONE 
IT IS HARD TO TELL THEM APART BUT 
THEIR MUM AND DAD HAVE DRESSED THEM 
IN DIFFERENT OUT FITS TO HELP 
THREE POUNDS AND TEN OUNCES WAS THE 
BIGGEST AND THEY WERE SEVEN WEEKS 
EARLY 
CONGRATULATIONS WHAT GORGEOUS 
TRIPLETS THEY ARE 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER THE 
CHICKEN IS RELATED TO THE T. REX 
YOU BUY THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE SAYING 
THAT THE SCIENTIFIC THEORY IS THEY 
HAVE DONE TESTS ON SOME REMAINS OF 
DINOSAURS AND FOUND THERE IS A LINK 
BETWEEN THE CHICKEN AND THE GIANT 
T. REX AND YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU 
CAN SEE IT IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE 
CHICKEN CHICKEN IF YOU WERE ASKED WHICH DINOSAUR 
DOES A CHICKEN RESEMBLE YOU YOU WOULDN'T SAY A STEGASORAUS 
DECLAN WHAT HAVE YOU GOT 
I DON'T THINK HE CAN HEAR US 
HELLO WE ARE IN BUSH HILLS IT IS 
SAID TO BE THE HOME OF THE OLDEST 
WHISKY IN THE WORLD THE OLDEST 
LEGAL DISTILLERY IN THE WORLD 
THESE THINGS ARE ALWAYS SUBJECT TO 
DISPUTE BUT WHAT WE KNOW FOR 
CERTAIN IS THEY HAVE HAD THE RIGHTS 
TO DISTIL WHISKY FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS 
GRANTED BY KING JAMES I 
THE STUFF THEY MAKE IS IRISH WHISKY 
IT IS DIFFERENT FROM SCOTCH WHISKY 
AND WE WILL TELL YOU WHY THEY MAKE 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES EVERY YEAR AND THEY 
ARE PLANNING TO DOUBLE PRODUCTION 
BY TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN 
THAT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS FLICKING A 
SWITCH BECAUSE THE STUFF HAS TO LIE 
IN THE BARRELS BEFORE IT IS READY 
TO COME TO US IN THE BARS OR AT OUR 
KITCHEN TABLES SO HOW DO THEY MAKE 
THE WHISKY L. WENT ON THE TOUR 
YESTERDAY WITH THE DISTILLERY 
OPERATIONS MANAGER AND THIS IS WHAT 
HE SHOWED ME 
WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A GOOD 
WHISKY WHISKY 
THE MAIN INGREEDANTS 
IS BARLEY WATER YEAST 
THAT'S WHERE YOU USED TO START IT 
OFF AND NOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING 
MODERN YES 
ALL I CAN SEE IS A MODERN YES LOAD OF BUBBLES 
THAT'S THE CRUSHED 
BARLEY WE ADD THE WATER AND THAT 
CONVERTS THE SUGARS INTO STARCHES 
AFTER FIFTY NINE HOURS WE HAVE LOW WINE OF 
APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT 
THAT'S THE HOL 
WE DISTIL THREE 
TIMES HERE AND WE TRY TO GET AS 
PURE ALCOHOL AS POSSIBLE BY GETTING 
THE THIRD DISTILLATION 
WHERE 
THE ALCOHOL WE FILL IT 
WE FILL IT INTO CASKS WHICH ARE PUT IN THE 
WAREHOUSES WAREHOUSES SO THIS IS HOW WE TAKE THE WHISKY 
OUT OF THE BARRELS AT BUSHMILLS 
THIS IS WHERE WE TAKE THE BUNGS OUT 
OF THE CASKS WE MAKE UP THE 
VARIOUS BLENDS OF BUSHMILLS OR 
BLACKBUSH BLACKBUSH THE BOTTLES ARE FED INTO THE LINE 
WE RINSE THEM OUT WITH WHISKY AND 
AND BRING THEM ALONG AND FILL THEM 
WITH BACKBUSH AND PUT THEM ALONG 
THE LINE AND INSERT THE CORK AND 
CAP AND DO A QULT INSPECTION AND 
BRING QUALITY INSPECTION AND 
BRING THE WHISKY TOGETHER 
THINGS LIKE AGE ARE IMPORTANT BUT 
IT GIVES THE INDUSTRY A CHALLENGE 
HOW YOU ATTRACT YOUNGER DRINKERS 
WHO AREN'T TOUCHING THE STUFF 
WITHOUT CHAINLGING THE CHANGING 
THE BRAND 
GORDON DONOGHUE IS THE DISTILLERY 
DIRECTOR AT BUSHMILLS 
GOOD MORNING 
GOOD MORNING HOW ARE YOU 
THAT'S A 
CRITICAL POINT FOR YOU 
IF WE LOOK AT THE MARKET OVERALL 
IT IS SEEN VERY MUCH AS AN OLD 
MAN'S DRINK 
YES HOWEVER THE 
DRINKERS ARE TURNING TO WHISKY 
WHICH IS NOT JUST IRISH BUT SCOTCH 
ARE IN THE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE AGE GROUP AND 
THEY ARE ATTRACTED BY THE STORY 
WHEN WE TELL THE STORY IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT TO KNOW 
ABOUT AND LEARN AND IF THEY CAN 
TASTE THE PRODUCT THEY ARE 
CONVINCED CONVINCED THERE IS INDEPENDENT RESEARCH DONE 
BY MINTEL THEY SHOW THAT SALES 
OVERALL OF WHISKY ARE DOWN SIXTEEN PER CENT IN 
THE LAST FIVE YEARS THIS IS A 
DIFFICULT INDUSTRY TO BE IN 
HOWEVER IRISH WHISKY REVERSED THAT 
WE ARE IN THE MATURE WHISKY MARKETS 
LAST YEAR WE HAD DOUBLE DIGIT 
GROWTH WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO A 
GREAT FUTURE 
IT IS PEOPLE SPENDING MORE ON 
THINGS LIKE SPECIALIST SINGLE MALTS 
AND LIKE 
WHEN YOU TASTE SOMETHING 
NOW YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE IT IS 
MADE AND WHAT'S THE HISTORY AND WE 
HAVE THAT IN SPADES HERE THERE IS 
FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF TRADITION AND THAT'S 
WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR 
THERE IS TASTE FOR THINGS LIKE 
COCKTAILS SOME OTHER WHISKEYS COME 
ON THE MARKET WHICH HAVE BEEN 
DESIGNED FOR MIXING WITH COCA COLA 
OR OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT HOW DO 
YOU GET INTO THAT MARKET WITHOUT 
COMPLETELY DESTROYING THE ESSENCE 
OF EITHER IRISH OR SCOTCH WHISKY 
WE DO A RANGE WE HAVE BLENDED 
WHISKY WHICH YOU CAN DRINK NEAT OR 
IN SHOTS YOU CAN DRINK IT WITH 
CRANBERRY JUICE 
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE GOT NOW L. WAS 
ASKING HOW YOU CHANGE THAT OR DO 
YOU CHANGE IT OR STAND BACK AND SAY 
NO WE HAVE GOT SOMETHING THAT'S 
RECOGNISED AND THAT'S WHERE WE 
STAKE THE FUTURE OF THE COMPANY 
THAT'S WHERE WE GO 
IF YOU GO UP TO THE SIXTEEN TO TWENTY ONE YEAR 
OLD MALTS WE ARE HAPPY WITH PEOPLE 
TO DRINK WHISKY ANYWAY THEY LIKE 
SIX PER CENT GROWTH LAST YEAR IN THE MARKET 
WE THINK WE'VE PROVED RIGHT 
GORDON DONOGHUE THE DIRECTOR 
HE IS HAPPY THEY ARE BUCKING THE 
TREND IN THE MARKET BUT THE WHISKY 
INDUSTRY AS WHOLE SALES ARE 
DECLINING A TOUGH BUSINESS TO BE 
IN MORE FROM BUSH BUSHMILLS 
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING 
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY OF KEEPING 
TEENAGERS OUT OF TROUBLE MAYBE 
TEACHING THEM TO BOX COULD HELP 
THEM CURB THEIR AGGRESSION WILL IT

APRIL ALSO AHEAD THIS MORNING 
HOLLYWOOD STAR WESLEY SNIPES IS 
GIVEN THREE YEARS IN JAIL FOR 
FAILING TO PAY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
IN TAXES THE C. I. A. RELEASES IMAGES 
OF A SECRET NUCLEAR REACTOR AND 
ACCUSES NORTH KOREA OF HELPING 
SYRIA TO BUILD IT 
WE'RE AT THE WORLD'S OLDEST WHISKY 
DISTILLERY IN COUNTY ANTRIM 
FINDING OUT HOW THEY TURN THIS INTO 
GLASSES OF THIS 
YOU KNOW THE ONE THEY'VE JUST 
ADDED A GAMES ROOM ABOVE THEIR 
GARAGE GARAGE SHE ALWAYS MADE SURE SHE KNEW HER 
PLACE WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT WHY 
THERE IS BIT OF HIGH SNINTH 
DOCKIA IN ALL OF US 
FIRST OUR MAIN STORY A SENIOR 
PRISON OFFICER SAYS INMATES ARE SO 
COMFORTABLE IN JAIL THEY DON'T WANT 
TO ESCAPE GLYN TRAVIS SAYS INMATES 
ARE HAPPY TO STAY INSIDE BECAUSE 
THEY CAN GET HOLD OF DRUGS MOBILE 
PHONES AND PROSTITUTES IT IS NOT 
THE FIRST TIME IT HAS BEEN 
SUGGESTED THAT PRISONERS LEAD CUSHY 
LIVES BUT WHAT THIS LATEST 
CRITICISM HIGHLIGHTS IS THAT FOR 
SOME INMATES IT IS SO GOOD GIVEN 
THE CHANCE THEY DON'T WANT TO 
LEAVE IN ONE CASE A DRUG DEALER 
BROKE INTO EVER THORPE JAIL IN 
YORKSHIRE TO SUPPLY INMATES WITH 
DRUGS AND MOBILE PHONES THE MAN 
SCALED THE WALLS OF THE PRISON WITH 
A LADDER AND BROKE IN THROUGH A 
WINDOW 
HE ALSO CLAIMS THERE HAVE BEEN 
SIMILAR INCIDENTS IN OTHER JAILS 
THERE WAS EVEN AN ATTEMPT AT ONE 
PRISON TO SMUGGLE IN PROSTITUTES 
MR. TRAVIS THINKS A SHORTAGE OF 
PRISON OFFICERS AND RELAXED REGIMES 
ARE TO BLAME THE PRISON SERVICE 
HAS RESPONDED TO THE SECURITY 
BREACH AT EVER THORPE IN YORKSHIRE 
SAYING IT BECAME AWARE IN JANUARY 
AND IT TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION BY 
MOVING THE FORMER GOVERNOR TO NEW 
ROLE IT SAYS AT NO TIME WERE 
PRISONERS OUT OF THEIR CELLS 
POLICE ARE CONTINUING TO QUESTION 
TWO PEOPLE ABOUT THE MURDER OF 
JAMES HUGHES THE SEVERELY DISABLED 
MAN WHOSE BODY WAS DISCOVERED AT 
HIS HOME IN REDDITCH ON WEDNESDAY 
IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT ONE OF THOSE 
BEING QUESTIONED IS BRIAN KIRKBY 
THE PARTNER OF HUGHES'S MOTHER 
HEATHER WARDLE WHO WAS FOUND DEAD 
ON MONDAY SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE OUR CORRESPONDENT 
ANTHONY BARTRAM IS IN REDDITCH FOR 
US CAN YOU TELL US THE LATEST ON 
THE POLICE QUESTIONING THAT IS 
ONGOING ONGOING YES WELL LAST EVENING THE POLICE 
WERE GIVEN AN EXTRA TWELVE HOURS TO 
QUESTION THE MAN AND THE YOUTH THEY 
HAVE IN CUSTODY AS YOU SAID IT IS 
BEING REPORTED HERE LOCALLY AND 
MORE WIDELY THIS MORNING THAT THE 
MAN IN CUSTODY IS BRIAN KIRBY 
HEATHER WARDLE'S LONG TERM PARTNER 
JAMES HUGHES'S STEP FATHER IF THE 
POLICE WANT MORE TIME THEY WILL 
HAVE TO GO TO THE MAGISTRATES' 
COURT TO APPLY FOR THAT BECAUSE IT 
RUNS OUT THIS MORNING BUT AT THE 
MOMENT WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY 
COMFIRMATION FROM OFFICERS IN THE 
MEANTIME THEY ARE SAYING THEY HAVE 
TO RELY ON DENTAL RECORDS TO 
IDENTIFY JAMES'S BODY AND THAT WILL 
HAVE A KNOCK ON EFFECT ON THE 
POSTMORTEM TO DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW 
HE DIED 
THERE ARE A LOT OF STORIES 
SURROUNDING HOW JAMES'S BODY WAS 
FOUND CAN YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT 
THAT 
THERE IS A LOT FOR PEOPLE TO THAT TAKE IN AND THIS MORNING IT HAS 
BEEN SUGGESTED THAT JAMES'S BODY 
WAS FOUND IN A SUITCASE THAT IS 
VERY MUCH UNCONFIRMED BY THE POLICE 
AND AT THIS STAGE IN AN INQUIRY IT 
IS NORMAL THAT DETECTIVES WILL STEP 
BACK FROM THE MEDIA TO CARRY OUT A 
DELICATE PART OF THE OPERATION AND 
THEY'RE NOT CONFIRMING ANY DETAILS 
IN TERMS OF HOW THE BODY WAS FOUND 
WE KNOW IT WAS FOUND AT THE FAMILY 
HOME BEHIND US AND THAT REMAINS 
VERY MUCH AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE AND 
THE POLICE HAVE WARNED THAT THE 
ACTIVITIES WILL CONTINUE FOR SOME 
DAYS AND THE RESIDENTS WILL RECEIVE 
A LETTER LATER IN THE DAY FROM THE 
AREA POLICE COMMANDER TO ASK THEM 
TO BEAR WITH THEM AND HELP IN ANY 
WAY THEY CAN THIS INVESTIGATION 
HAS STILL SOME WAY TO RUN YET 
THE C. I. A. HAS RELEASED PHOTOGRAPHS OF 
WHAT THEY SAY WAS SECRET NUCLEAR 
REACTOR BEING BUILT IN SYRIA 
AMERICA HAS ACCUSED NORTH KOREA OF 
HELPING THE SYRIANS TO BUILD THE 
PLANT WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN 
DESTROYED BY ISRAELI WARPLANES 
SYRIA HAS DISMISSED THE CLAIMS AS 
RIDICULOUS THERE IS NO EXPLANATION 
AS TO HOW THESE PHOTOS WERE 
OBTAINED BUT THE AMERICANS SAY 
THEY SHOW NUCLEAR PLANT SECRETLY 
BEING BUILT IN THE SYRIAN DESERT 
THEY ALSO SHOW SATELLITE IMAGES AND 
A VOICE POINTS OUT SIMILARITIES TO 
A FACILITY IN NORTH KOREA USED TO 
DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
NOTE THE SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT OF 
VERTICAL TUBE OPENINGS IN THE 
REACTOR ON THE LEFT AND NORTH 
KOREA'S ON THE RIGHT 
AND SMILING 
FOR THE CAMERA THE ALLEGED HEAD OF 
SYRIA'S NUCLEAR PROGRAMME STANDING 
BESIDE HIS NORTH KOREAN COUNTERPART 
THE SAME OFFICIAL WHO HAVES BEEN 
NEGOTIATING THE U. S. ABOUT HALTING 
HIS PROGRAMME FINALLY THE PLANT 
IS SHOWN AS DESTROYED THE ATTACKS 
CARRIED OUT BY ISRAELI WARPLANES 
LAST SEPTEMBER THERE ARE CLAIMS 
THAT THE SYRIANS AND NORTH KOREANS 
TRIED TO COVER UP THE PLANT WITH 
HUGE TARPAULIN SHEETS SYRIA SAYS 
IT IS ALL FANTASY THE WHITE HOUSE 
SAYS IT IS CONVINCED THAT NORTH 
KOREA WAS HELPING SYRIA TO BUILD A 
SECRET NUCLEAR FACILITY BUT THERE 
ARE STILL PLENTY OF UNANSWERED 
QUESTIONS SUCH AS WHY RELEASE THIS 
SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE JUST NOW 
WHAT EFFECT WILL IT HAVE ON 
AMERICAN EFFORTS TO PERSUADE NORTH 
KOREA TO GIVE UP ITS NUCLEAR 
PROGRAMME AND ALSO IS THIS A 
WARNING TO IRAN 
FRESH EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO 
PERSUADE MOTORISTS IN SCOTLAND TO 
AVOID PANIC BUYING OF FUEL AHEAD 
OF SUNDAY'S PLANNED STRIKE AT THE 
GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY RETAILERS SAY 
THERE IS AT LEAST SEVENTY DAYS' SUPPLY 
AS LONG AS MOTORISTS REMAIN CALM 
LORNA GORDON IS AT THE PLANT FOR US 
THIS MORNING 
DRIVING HERE THIS 
MORNING I PASSED SEVERAL PETROL 
STATIONS WHICH HAD PUMPS EMPTY 
SIGNS SAYING THEY HAD RUN OUT OF 
FUEL BUT THAT THEY WERE EXPECTING 
DELIVERIES LATER TODAY WE ARE 
BEING TOLD TIME AND TIME AGAIN NOT 
TO PANIC THERE IS PLENTY OF FUEL 
IN THE SYSTEM AS LONG AS PEOPLE 
CONTINUE TO BUY PETROL IN THEIR 
NORMAL PATTERNS OF PURCHASING 
THEY BEGAN CLOSING DOWN THE MAIN 
GRANGEMOUTH SITE LAST MONDAY AN 
OPERATION WHICH WILL BE COMPLETED 
BY TOMORROW NORMALLY THE PLANT 
PROCESSES TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL 
DAY TURNING IT INTO PETROL AND 
DIESEL FOR MOST OF SCOTLAND 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND PARTS OF 
NORTHERN ENGLAND THE SHUTDOWN HAS 
PROMPTED LOCALISED SHORTAGES OF 
FUEL AT PUMPS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL 
AREAS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE AREAS PANICKING AND FILLING UP THE 
QUEUES HAVE BEEN PRETTY BIG TODAY 
THE LIMIT IS TWENTY A GO SO THAT'S 
QUITE FAIR 
WE'VE JUST BEEN TAKING 
IT EASY AND GOING TO THE PETROL 
STATION WHEN WE NEED IT AND WE'RE 
GETTING IT IT'S NOT TOO BAD BUT BUT FOR THE MOST PART MOTORISTS APPEAR 
TO HAVE HEEDED THE CALL NOT TO 
INDULGE IN PANIC BUYING MINISTERS 
SAY THERE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FUEL 
IN THE SYSTEM TO LAST WELL INTO 
NEXT MONTH BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS 
THAT THE SHUTDOWN COULD DISRUPT 
SUPPLIES INTO A NEARBY B. P. PLANT 
THAT COLLECTS MORE THAN A THIRD OF 
THE U. K.'S OUTPUT FROM THE NORTH SEA 
IF THOSE STATION BARRELS OF OIL 
WERE TO BE SHUT IN THAT WOULD HAVE 
AN ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE NATION 
AND OF THE MONEY OVER ONE MILLION 
AN HOUR IS PAID IN TAX 
THE WORKERS 
ARE GOING ON STRIKE BECAUSE OF THE 
COMPANY'S PLAN TO ALTER THE FINAL 
PENSION SCHEME AND TALKS IN LONDON 
BROKE DOWN EARLIER THIS WEEK THE THE MINISTER TONY MCNULTY IS COMING 
UP TO ADDRESS THE WORKERS FROM THE 
UNION GRANGEMOUTH HAS NEVER BEEN 
SHUT DOWN IN ITS SEVENTY FOUR YEAR HISTORY 
AND IT WILL TAKE UP TO TWO WEEKS TO 
BRING IT UP TO FULLY BACK ON LINE 
A STUDY SUGGEST THAT IS AT LEAST 
SEVENTY PER CENT OF ALL TWELVE AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLS 
WILL BE INOCULATED AGAINST THE 
VIRUS THAT CAUSES CERVICAL CANCER 
WHEN THE PROGRAMME FOR VACCINATION 
BEGINS LATER THIS YEAR AND THE 
SURVEY SUGGESTS THAT FEW PARENTS 
ARE WORRIED THAT IT WILL LEAD THEIR 
DAUGHTERS TO MORE SEX DESPITE 
WARNINGS OF PROM IS CUTE THEY HAVE 
DECIDED NOT TO WAIT FOR THE 
VACCINATION AND GET IT DONE 
PRIVATELY BUT FROM SEPTEMBER TWELFTH 
AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLS WILL BE 
OFFERED A VACCINATION TO PROTECT 
AGAINST CERVICAL CANCER A SURVEY 
SHOWS THAT ALMOST A THIRD OF 
PARENTS DIDN'T GIVE PERMISSION FOR 
THE DAUGHTERS TO HAVE THE VACCINE 
THERE WERE CERTAINLY CONCERNS SOME 
ABOUT THE SAFETY AND THE AGE IT WAS 
GIVEN BUT ONLY A HANDFUL HAD 
CONCERNS ABOUT AN EFFECT ON SEXUAL 
BEHAVIOUR BUT EXPERTS SAY IT 
SHOULD BE PREVENTIVE 
THIS IS ABOUT 
PREVENTING CERVICAL CANCER AND THAT 
IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IT IS A 
TERRIBLE DISEASE AND IF YOU HAVE A 
VACCINE THAT CAN PREVENT SEVENTY PER CENT OF 
THOSE CANCERS IT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
FOR PARENTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT 
AND MAKE SURE THEIR GIRLS ARE 
VACCINATED 
THEY ARE NOT WORRYING VACCINATED ABOUT CANCER BUT IT IS GOING TO 
COST ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR TO 
VACCINATE GIRLS THEIR AGE AGAINST 
MOST FORMS OF CERVICAL CANCER IF 
THE PROGRAMME IS SUCCESSFUL THOUGH 
IT WILL EVENTUALLY SAVE HUNDREDS OF 
LIVES A YEAR 
WE HAVE SOME BREAKING NEWS COMING 
INTO US THIS MORNING THE OFFICE OF 
FAIR TRADING HAS NAMED SUPERMARKETS 
INCLUDING TESCO AND SAINSBURY'S 
INTO AN INVESTIGATION INTO PRICE 
FIXING IN THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY 
THAT IS ALL WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT 
WE HAVE PEOPLE LOOKING INTO IT AND 
WE'LL BRING YOU MORE ON THAT STORY 
AS WE GET IT THIS MORNING BUT THE 
OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING IS 
INVESTIGATING PRICE FIXING 
FROM MATERIAL GIRL TO MALAWI 
AMBASSADOR MADONNA TOOK TO THE RED 
CARPET LAST NIGHT TO PREMIERE HER 
NEW FILM ABOUT ORPHANS IN MALAWI 
BECAUSE OF AIDS AND FEATURES HER 
SOON TO BE ADOPTED SON DAVID 
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME WHY I CHOSE 
MALAWI BUT I SAY I DIDN'T IT CHOSE 
ME ME THOSE ARE THE TOP STORIES SELF 
HARMING IS A DIFFICULT AND HIGHLY 
EMOTIONAL SUBJECT THIS MORNING 
NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS THE NUMBER OF 
CHILDREN INVOLVED IS INCREASING 
ACCORDING TO A SURVEY CARRIED OUT 
BY MENTAL HEALTH CARE SPECIALISTS 
AFFINITY HEALTHCARE TWENTY TWO PER CENT OF BOYS 
AND GIRLS SAID THEY HAD SELF HARMED 
THE FIGURE WAS HIGHER FOR GIRLS 
THIRTY TWO PER CENT ADMITTED THEY DELIBERATELY HURT 
THEMSELVES AND OF THOSE WHO SELF 
HARMED SEVENTY THREE PER CENT SAID THEY DID IT BY 
CUTTING AND OVER FORTY PER CENT OF CHILDREN 
SAID DEPRESSION WAS THE MAIN REASON 
JADE ROBERTS SON USED TO SELF HARM 
AND ROSEANNE PEARCE IS FROM 
CHILDLINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
COMING IN THIS MORNING JADE FOR 
PEOPLE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND IT CAN 
YOU GO THROUGH WHAT YOU DID AND WHY 
YOU DID IT 
SELF HARMING IS MAINLY 
A COPING MECHANISM IT IS AN 
OVERWHELMING FEELING THAT THERE IS 
STRESS AND PRESSURE AND ALL SORTS 
OF REASONS AND THEN THERE IS THE 
RELEASE OF THAT BY CUTTING BURNING 
AND OTHER FORMS OF SELF HARM HOW HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU STARTED THIS 
I WAS ABOUT TWELVE 
AND WHAT WERE YOU 
DOING I STARTED CUTTING AND 
DOING IT MOVED ON TO OTHER THINGS AND AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
IT STARTED 
WITH GLASS AND MOVED ON TO RAZORS 
SO YOU WOULD BREAK GLASS AND THEN 
CUT YOURSELF YES 
IT IS SHOCKING YES TO HEAR BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS 
PARTICULARLY GIRLS WHY LOT OF 
PARENTS ARE FINDING IT VERY HARD TO 
GET THEIR HEADS AROUND WHY GIRLS DO 
THIS 
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THIS REASONS AND CERTAINLY AT 
CHILDLINE LAST YEAR WE HAD OVER 
FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CALLS ABOUT SELF HARM AND IT 
HAS BEEN INCREASING STEADILY OVER 
THE PAST TEN YEARS THERE ARE MANY 
DIFFERENT ROOT CAUSES SOMETIMES IT 
IS RELATED TO A PARTICULAR CRISIS 
IN YOUR LIFE A CHILD MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN ABUSED THEY MIGHT BE FEELING 
GUILTY OR LOW ABOUT THEMSELVES 
SOMETIMES IT IS JUST A CUMULATIVE 
EFFECT OF MAYBE SCHOOL ISSUES 
BUT IS IT ABOUT ACTUALLY HARMING 
YOURSELF IS IT AN ATTENTION 
SEEKING DEVICE 
NOT AT ALL 
IS IT 
ABOUT HAVING SOME CONTROL OVER YOUR 
PAIN WHAT ARE THE REASONS FOR 
DOING THAT RATHER THAN ANYTHING 
ELSE 
THERE IS A VARIETY AGAIN OF ELSE DIFFERENT REASONS SOME PEOPLE DO 
IT TO GET A KIND OF RELEASE SOME 
PEOPLE DO IT TO PUNISH THEMSELVES 
PARTICULARLY IF THEY ARE FEELING 
GUILTY OR LOW ABOUT THEMSELVES 
THEY MIGHT WANT TO SELF PUNISH 
SOME PEOPLE DO IT AS A WAY OF 
DEALING WITH DEPRESSION OR VERY 
DIFFERENT FEELINGS AS JADE WAS 
DESCRIBING 
WHEN YOU WERE DOING IT DESCRIBING TO YOURSELF JADE WHERE WERE YOU 
DOING IT ON YOUR BODY WHERE PEOPLE 
COULD NOT SEE 
MINE WAS NOT 
ATTENTION SEEKING NOBODY EVERYBODY 
HE SAW L. WAS DOING IT ON MY ARMS 
OR THE TOPS OF MY LEGS 
AND YOU 
WOULD COVER IT UP YES 
DID ANYBODY YES SEE IT YOU OBVIOUSLY MADE POINT 
THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW 
YES MY 
AUNT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FIRST 
PEOPLE WHO SAW IT BY ACCIDENT BUT 
I WOULD WEAR JUMPERS AND LONG 
SLEEVED TOPS 
AND WHEN SHE SAW IT 
DID SHE QUESTION YOU 
I BRUSHED IT 
OFF AT THAT POINT BUT SHE WENT TO 
MY PARENTS 
IT IS INCREDIBLY BRAVE FOR YOU TO 
TALK ABOUT IT IN PUBLIC YOU HAVE 
GOT PAST THAT NOW HOW DID YOU GET 
TO THAT POINT 
YOU GET TO A POINT 
IN YOUR LIFE WHERE THERE HAS TO BE 
A CHANGE GENERALLY IN MY LIFE I 
WAS HAPPIER SO I NEEDED IT LESS AND 
LESS AND THEN IT CAME TO A POINT 
WHERE I DIDN'T NEED IT ANYMORE AND 
WITH THE RIGHT SUPPORT AND THINGS 
AROUND ME I MANAGED TO MOVE ON 
IF PARENT IS LISTENING WHAT 
ADVICE CAN YOU GIVE THEM IF THEY 
ARE CONCERNED 
IT IS REALLY 
IMPORTANT TO LISTEN TO YOUR CHILD 
IT CAN BE SHOCKING FOR A PARENT AND 
BRING UP A LOAD OF MIXED FEELINGS 
FOR THE PARENT BUT IT IS IMPORTANT 
NOT TO OVERREACT AND NOT APPEAR TOO 
SHOCKED OR ANGRY AND TO ALLOW THEM 
TO TALK AND MAYBE TO ENABLE THEM TO 
TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE OR RECOMMEND 
THAT THEY WOULD CALL CHILDLINE 
BECAUSE WE CAN TALK TO THEM WE ARE 
THERE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY AND WE CAN 
TALK TO THEM AT ANY TIME WHEN THEY 
FEEL AT THAT MOMENT THEY WANT TO 
SELF HARM SELF HARM THANK YOU FOR COMING IN 
COMING UP LATER

THE WORLD AS NIGHT FALLS 
THE GLOWING AREAS ARE THOSE WITH 
THE MOST LIGHT POLLUTION AND AS YOU 
CAN SEE ENGLAND IS ONE OF THE 
WORST AFFECTED COUNTRIES

DARKEST PLACE KIELDER FOREST IN 
NORTHUMBERLAND NORTHUMBERLAND OBVIOUSLY NOT LOOKING TOO DARK AT 
THE MOMENT RAYMOND 
NO THE SUN IS COMING UP NOT THAT 
YOU CAN SEE MUCH OF IT KIELDER 
FOREST IS KNOWN AS THE DARKEST 
PLACE IN ENGLAND BECAUSE IT IS 
FAMOUS AMONG ASTRONOMERS AS AS 
OFFERING SOME OF THE CLEAREST SKIES 
IN THE COUNTRY TO VIEW THE STARS 
THEY HAVE A NEW FACILITY IT IS 
EUROPE'S NEW OBSERVATORY ON WHICH 
THEY CAN HAVE A GALLERY ON THE 
GALAXY AND MANY ARE DELIGHTED AT

ERNIE SMITH LEFT THE BRIGHT LIGHTS 
OF NEWCASTLE FOR THE CLEAR SKIES OF 
KIELDER WHY BECAUSE HE IS AN 
AMATEUR AS ASTRONOMER 
I LEFT 
BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT POLLUTION IT 
IS UNBELIEVABLE THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT 
POLLUTION I LOVE THE DARK SKIES 
AND THIS IS A PERFECT AREA FOR DARK 
SKIES SKIES ITS LANDSCAPE IS BEGUILING AND 
BEAUTIFUL BY DAY BUT KIELDERER'S 
DELIGHTS ARE SPECTACULAR WHEN NIGHT 
FALLS FOR THIS IS S. 
DARKEST PLACE AND ITS BEST VIEW ON 
OTHER WORLDS 
BEFORE TODAY VISITORS HAD TO RELAY 
ON THE NAKED EYE TO STARGAZE NO

THE UNIVERSE WILL ENCOURAGE 
EVERYONE TO APPRECIATE WHAT THE 
NIGHT SKY HAS TO OFFER 
THERE IS A LOT OF ASTRONOMERS WHO 
COME UP HERE TO USE THE DARK SKIES

OF THAT AND REACH OUT TO LAY PEOPLE 
TO BE ABLE TO JUST USE THE OBTRY 
WHENEVER THEY WANTED

TAKEN AT KIELDER SHOW WHAT MANY IN 
ENGLAND ARE MISSING OUT ON AWAY 
FROM THE GLARE OF TOWNS AND CITIES 
A SHOW THAT IS LITERALLY OUT OF

DISCOVERIES BUT THEY HOPE TO HELP

I THOUGHT NOT 
ANYTHING ELSE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL 
CHALLENGE YOU AGAIN IN HALF AN HOUR 
NOW DO YOU KNOW YOUR PLACE WE MAY 
BE MORE SOCIALLY MOBILE THAN EVER 
BEFORE BUT IT SEEMS WE HAVE AN 
INSTINCTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE 
WE STAND IN IT THE PECKING ORDER 
YES SCIENTISTS HAVE PINPOINTED A 
PART OF OUR BRAIN THAT GETS INTO 
ACTION WHENEVER WE MEET SOMEBODY 
FROM A DIFFERENT CLASS 
THIS IS HYACINTH BOCQUET AT HER 
FINEST 
DELIA WHEEL RIGHT WHO FINEST WHO DELIA IN THE MOCK TUDOR SEMI 
DETACHED ON THE CORNER OF THE ROAD 
YOU KNOW THE ONE THEY'VE JUST 
ADDED A GAMING ROOM ON THE TOP OF 
THEIR GARAGE THE ONE THING I CAN'T 
STAND IS SNOBBERY AND ONE 
UPPISHNESS PEOPLE WHO TRY TO 
PRETEND THEY ARE SUPERIOR MAKES IT 
SO MUCH HARDER FOR THOSE OF US WHO 
REALLY ARE 
THAT'S GREAT AND WITH 
US IS LINDA POPESCU A PSYCHOLOGIST 
AND FORMER APPRENTICE WINNER 
NICHOLAS DE LACY BROWN MANY MIGHT 
THINK THAT THE DE LACY BROWN 
SLIPPED IN TO CHANGE YOUR SOCIAL 
STATUS IS THAT RIGHT NICK TO TO SOME EXTENT BUT IT WAS A FAMILY 
NAME WHEN I CAME TO LONDON IN A 
VERY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT I DID 
WANT TO BE NOTICED AND I COULD 
HAVE HAD ONE NAME BUT I SWAPPED IT 
AND THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING 
A DOUBLE BARRELLED NAME THAT GETS 
YOU NOTICED 
FOR EXAMPLE 
WHEN I 
CALL A RESTAURANT FOR A TABLE 
RESERVATION I GOT ONE MUCH QUICKER 
AND I FOUND THE TABLES WOULD BE 
BETTER AS WELL 
THIS IS INTERESTING 
LINDA BECAUSE THIS IS AN AMERICAN 
STUDY AND ON THE FACE OF IT THE 
U. S. DOES NOT HAVE A CLASS ISSUE BUT 
THEY STILL RELATE TO IT ON A MONEY 
LEVEL 
ABSOLUTELY THERE ARE LEVEL HIGHBACKCAL ISSUES WHETHER IT IS 
CLASS OR MONEY WAY BACK WHEN WE 
WERE CAVEMEN OR WAIVE WOMEN WE 
NEEDED TO AWARE OF WHERE THE 
HIERARCHY WAS IF WE WANTED TO COSY 
UP TO THE HIGHEST RANKING CAVEMAN 
OR TO BE AGGRESSIVE TO HIM SO 
BEING AWARE OF WHERE YOU STAND 
SOCIALLY IS IMPORTANT FOR SURVIVAL 
AND WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS 
RESEARCH IS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING 
WE LEARN WE ARE ALREADY BORN WITH 
IT IT HARD WIRED INTO OUR BRAIN 
AND PRECISELY AND IT HAD TO BRAIN BE IN INDIA YOU'LL LEARN THE CASTE 
SYSTEM AND IF YOU'RE IN LONDON YOU 
LEARN THE CLASS SYSTEM AND IN 
AMERICA YOU LEARN THE MONEY SYSTEM 
BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING IS WE 
RESPOND TO IT AND THAT PROBABLY 
DOES COME FROM EVOLUTION WE WALK 
INTO A ROOM AND NEED TO KNOW 
WHERE DO YOU STAND AND WHO DO YOU 
NEED TO TALK TO TO BENEFIT FROM 
THIS IT IS INTERESTING YOU SAYING 
YOU CALL UP A RESTAURANT AND USE 
YOUR NAME BECAUSE I WONDER HOW 
MUCH THAT IS APPROACH BECAUSE IF 
YOU RING UP AND EXPECT TO GET A 
BETTER TABLE I WONDER IF YOU DO 
AND THAT IS INTERESTING DO YOU 
WALK DIFFERENTLY OR FEEL BIGGER 
BECAUSE YOU CHANGED YOUR NAME I'M I'M SURE THERE IS AN AMOUNT OF 
SUPERIORITY THAT GOES WITH IT 
ANYTHING THAT GIVES YOU CONFIDENCE 
IF YOU BELIEVE THAT BY HAVING A 
LONGER NAME YOU'LL BE NOTICED IT 
IS AUTOMATIC 
AND SOME PEOPLE WOULD 
SAY THAT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE 
CHOSEN TO CHANGE YOUR NAME SHOWS 
YOU MIGHT BE INSECURE 
OH YES WHO 
IS NOT INSECURE OR NOT CONFIDENT 
BENEATH 
THAT IS INTERESTING BENEATH BENEATH WE'RE ALL LACKING IN 
CONFIDENCE AND NOT KNOWING WHO WE 
ARE 
TO SOME EXTENT WE REASSESS OUR ARE CONFIDENCE DAY BY DAY AND PART OF 
BEING ABLE TO SURVIVE IS A PART OF 
THAT BUT HOW DO WE REASSESS IT WE 
DO IT IN RELATION TO THE CONTEXT 
WE'RE IN IT IS NO SURPRISE YOU 
WENT ON TO A SHOW LIKE THE 
APPRENTICE WHICH IS ALL ABOUT 
SHOWING WHO YOU ARE HAD YOU GONE 
TO OR GONE INTO AC DEEMAIR YOU MAY 
HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT A FEW MONTHS 
AGO THERE WAS A GREAT STUDY ABOUT 
YOUR POSTCODE AND PEOPLE SORT OF 
ARRANGING THEM 
AND WHAT ABOUT OTHER ADVANTAGES 
WELL IT DID WORK WHEN I WAS BUYING 
MY HOUSE BUT THE APPRENTICE IS A 
PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT THESE 
FINDINGS ARE ALL ABOUT BECAUSE 
WHEN PEOPLE GET ON THE SHOW IT IS 
ABOUT THE ELATION TO GET TO THE TOP 
AND THERE IS ALMOST A MINI CULTURE 
OF SOCIAL STANDING WITHIN THE 
COMPETITION FOR THOSE WHO FALL OUT 
THE STRESS IS HUGE AND FOR THOSE 
WHO GET TO THE TOP THE SUCCESS IS 
AMAZING AND I THINK THAT IS 
REFLECTED IN THE COMPETITION NOT NOT THAT I HAVE EVER DONE IT BUT IF 
YOU PUT DOCTOR IN FRONT OF YOUR 
NAME THAT INSTANTLY CHANGES 
PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION PEOPLE THINK 
OF YOU ENTIRELY DIFFERENTLY IS 
THAT AN ILLUSTRATION 
IT IS IN A 
WAY PEOPLE MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT 
TITLES BEING A DOCTOR 
SHOWS YOU HAVE SPENT A LONG TIME 
STUDYING AND REVEREND IS ANOTHER 
ONE DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU VALUE L. 
ALWAYS FIND IT INTERESTING HOW MUCH 
PEOPLE'S APPEARANCE LEVEL GOES UP 
FOR INSTANCE WHEN YOU MEET A GUY 
AND HE SAYS I'M BOB YOU THINK 
O. K. HE'S CUTE BUT IF HE SAYS 
I'M DOCTOR BOB YOU THINK HE'S 
REALLY CUTE 
I THINK IT WOULD BE 
DOCTOR ROBERT THOUGH 
THE MAIN STORIES THIS MORNING A 
SENIOR PRISON OFFICER SAYS MANY 
INMATES ARE SO COMFORTABLE IN JAIL 
THEY DON'T WANT TO ESCAPE 
AND THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING ONE 
INVESTIGATING SUPERMARKETS AND 
CIGARETTE COMPANIES OVER THE AECKS 
THAT THEY FIXED THE PRICE OF 
TOBACCO AND COMING UP

WHERE I WON THE PERRIER AND OVER 
TIME TIME ISN'T IT GHASTLY THAT ROBBIE IS 
LEAVING TAKE THAT 
JENNY ECLAIR IS

AND BRIGHT DAY 
BE A DRY AND BRIGHT DAY LET'S GO BACK TO BUSHMILLS WHERE IS 
WHERE WE WILL FIND FIND DECLAN 
I SUPPOSE YOU CALL THIS THE END OF 
THE CHAIN THIS IS THE BIT THAT 
MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE 
BAR WERE THE STUFF IS SOLD WITH 
BUT THERE IS A LONG AND COMPLICATED 
PROCESS BEFORE YOU END UP WITH THE 
STUFF IN BOTTLES AND ON THE SHELVES 
AND AVAILABLE IN SUPERMARKETS 
A LOT OF IT DOWN TO HOW LONG THE 
WHISKY STAYS IN THE BOTTLE 
OR IF IT IS IN THE BARREL FOR UP TO 
TWENTY ONE YEARS THE WOMAN IN CHARGE OF 
HOW ALL THIS STUFF TASTES AND WHAT 
YOU DO TO IT MAKE IT TASTE THAT WAY 
IS THE MASTER BLENDER 
WE WILL TALK TO HER ABOUT THE TYPE 
OF JOB SHE HAS AND WHAT YOU DO AND 
HOW SHE SHE MANAGES TO CHANGE 
THINGS TO SHOW YOU HOW WHISKY IS 
MADE REMEMBER IT IS IRISH WHISKY 
NOT SCOTCH WHISKY THERE IS A 
DIFFERENCE IN THE PRODUCTION 
TECHNIQUE I WENT ON THE TOUR 
YESTERDAY WITH THE DISTILLING 
OPERATIONS MANAGER AND THIS WAS HIS 
LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES 
WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A GOOD 
WHISKY 
THE MAIN INGREDIENTS TO WHISKY MAKE A GREAT WHISKY IS BARLEY 
WATER YEAST 
THAT'S WHAT YOU USE 
TO START IT OFF YES YES HOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING MORE MODERN 
THAT'S CORRECT 
ALL I CAN SEE IS LOAD OF FROTHY 
BUBBLES WHAT IS IT 
THAT'S GRIST 
THAT'S THE CRUSHED BARLEY WE ADD 
THE WATER AND THAT CONVERTS THE 
STARCHES INTO SUGARS WE DRAIN THE 
SUGARS OFF AND ADD THE YEAST AND 
AFTER FIFTY NINE HOURS WE HAVE LOW WINE OF 
APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE TO EIGHT PER CENT 
THAT'S THE ALCOHOL YES YES THIS IS WHERE WE DISTIL WE DISTIL 
THREE TIMES THAT'S ONE MORE TIME 
THAN MOST MOST SCOTTISH 
DISTILLERIES WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS 
TO GET AS PURE AS ALCOHOL AS 
POSSIBLE BY DOING THE THIRD 
DISTILLATION DISTILLATION WHERE DOES IT GO FROM HERE 
WE FILL 
IT IT INTO CASKS WHICH ARE PUT IN 
THE WAREHOUSES 
THIS IS HOW WE TAKE THE WHISKY OUT 
OF THE BARREL HERE AT BUSHMILLS 
THIS IS WHERE WE TAKE THE BUNGS OUT 
OF THE CASKS AND PUT THE WHISKY 
INTO TROUGHS WE THEN MAKE UP THE 
VARIOUS BLENDS OF BUSHMILLS OR 
BLACKBUSH FOR BOTTLING 
THIS IS THE BOTTLING HALL THE 
BOTTLES ARE FED INTO THE LINE WE 
RINSE THEM OUT WITH WHISKY AND 
BRING THEM ALONG AND FILL THEM WITH 
BLACKBUSH AND PUT THEM ALONG THE 
LINE AND INSERT THE WORK AND CAP 
AND DO A QUALITY INSPECTION AND 
BRING THE WHISKY WHISKY TOGETHER 
HERE SHE IS THE WOMAN IN CHARGE OF 
THE TASTE THE MASTER BLENDER 
HELEN GOOD MORNING TOUSMT HELLO HELLO HOW DO YOU GET JOB THAT YOU TASTE 
WHISKY FOR LIVING 
THE DREAM JOB 
I HAVE BEEN THE MASTER BLENDER AT 
BUSHMILLS FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS 
WHAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU IS 
WHAT YOU DO 
THE TOOLS OF YOUR TRADE THERE IS 
BLENDED WHISKY AND YOU DECIDE WHAT 
THE BLEND IS 
IT IS YES WE 
PRODUCE TWO TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF 
WHISKY WE PRODUCE BLENDED WHISKEYS 
AND SINGLE MALT WHISKEYS WE FILL 
INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CASKS 
SOT BARREL THAT THE WHISKY HAS BEEN 
STORED IN INFLUENCES WHAT IT LOOKS 
LIKE WHAT IT TACEZ LIKE AT 
TASTES LIKE AT THE END OF THE 
PROCESS CAN YOU TELL WHAT BARRELS 
THESE HAVE BEEN IN 
YOU CAN INDEED 
THIS IS A SEN YEAR OLD SINGLE MALT 
TEN YEAR OLD SINGLE MALT WHAT 
YOU SEE IS A GOLDEN COLOUR 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO PICK UP IN REAL 
LIFE I CAN'T SEE IT 
THIS IS WHY YOU'RE THE MASTER 
BLENDER AND I'M NOT 
THIS IS WHAT I 
SPEND MY DAYS DOING 
THAT'S GOLDEN IN COLOUR 
SPEND MY DAYS DOING THAT'S GOLDEN IN COLOUR 
IF YOU FOLLOW ON THIS IS A SIXTEEN 
YEAR OLD AGAIN A SINGLE MALT 
WHICH WILL MATURE IN BUR BON CASKS 
AND SHERRY CASKS THERE IS A 
SLIGHTLY RED HINT AND THAT'S THE 
PORT COMING THROUGH 
THAT'S PART OF THE SECRET RECIPE 
THAT YOU FINISH IT IN DIFFERENT 
BARRELS TO GIVE IT DIFFERENT 
TASTES 
WE GIVE IT DIFFERENT TASTES TASTES THROUGH THE BARRELS IT IS CRYSTAL 
CLEAR PURE SPIRIT WHEN IT GOES 
INTO THE BARRELS AND COMES OUT LIKE

YOU WHY THERE'S A BIT OF HYACINTH 
BOCQUET IN ALL OF US 
FIRST OUR MAIN STORY A SENIOR 
PRISON OFFICER SAYS INMATES ARE SO 
COMFORTABLE IN JAIL THEY DON'T WANT 
TO ESCAPE THE ASSISTANT GENERAL 
SECRETARY OF THE PRISON OFFICERS' 
ASSOCIATION GLYN TRAVIS SAYS 
CONVICTS ARE HAPPY TO STAY INSIDE 
BECAUSE THEY CAN GET HOLD OF DRUGS 
MOBILE PHONES AND PROSTITUTES 
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME IT'S BEEN 
SUGGESTED THAT PRISONERS LEAD CUSHY 
LIVES BUT WHAT THIS LATE EST 
SURVEY HIGHLIGHTS IS THAT FOR SOME 
INMATES IT'S SO GOOD THEY DON'T 
WANT TO LEAVE IN ONE CASE A DRUG 
DEALER BROKE IN EVERTHORPE JAIL IN 
YORKSHIRE TO SUPPLY INMATES WITH 
DRUGS AND MOBILE PHONES MR. TRAVIS 
SAID THE MAN SCALED THE WALLS OF 
THE PRISON WITH A LADDER TO BREAK 
IN THROUGH A CELL WINDOW 
HE SAYS HE ALSO CLAIMS THERE HAVE BEEN 
SIMILAR INCIDENTS IN OTHER JAILS 
THERE WAS EVEN AN ATTEMPT AT ONE 
PRISON TO SMUGGLE IN PROSTITUTES 
MR. TRAVIS THINKS A SHORTAGE OF 
PRISON OFFICERS AND RELAXED REGIMES 
ARE TO BLAME 
THE PRISON SERVICE HAS RESPONDED TO 
THE SECURITY BREACH AT EVERTHORPE 
IN YORKSHIRE SAYING IT BECAME 
AWARE IN JANUARY AND IT TOOK 
IMMEDIATE ACTION IT SAYS AT NO 
TIME WERE PRISONERS OUT OF THEIR 
CELLS CELLS THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING SAYS 
IT'S INVESTIGATING SEVERAL 
SUPERMARKETS AND TOBACCO COMPANIES 
FOR PRICE FIXING IN TOBACCO 
PRODUCTS LTS LOOKING INTO WHETHER 
SUPERMARKETS INCLUDING ASDA 
SAINSBURY'S SAFE WAY SAFE WAY 
COLLUDED TO KEEP PRICES 
ARTIFICIALLY HIGH LET'S SPEAK TO 
OUR CORRESPONDENT SIMON JACK 
WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GOING ON THE THE OFT ARE KEEN TO STRESS THAT RATHER 
THAN PRICE FIXING TWENTY FOUR WHAT THEY 
CALL RETAIL PRICE CO ORDINATION 
THAT MEANS ONE MANUFACTURER WILL 
SAY TO THE RETAILER WHATEVER 
THEY'RE CHARGING FOR THEIR 
CIGARETTES I WANT YOU TO CHARGE THE 
SAME OR TEN M. MORE OR TEN P. LESS IF 
YOU HAVE A PREMIUM BRAND THEY MIGHT 
SAY I WANT THIS BRAND TO BE MORE OR 
LESS THAN ANOTHER THAT KIND OF CO 
ORDINATION WITH THE PRICEING IS 
TAKEN OUT OF CONTROL OF THE 
RETAILER IS AGAINST THE LAW WHAT WHAT CAN THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING DO 
ONCE THIS INVESTIGATION IS UNDER 
WAY 
THE NEXT THING WILL HAPPEN WAY TOBACCO COMPANIES WILL HAVE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK PLEAD 
THEIR CASE IF THEY ARE FOUND 
GUILTY THEY HAVE SOME PRETTY 
SWEEPING POWERS THEY CAN FINE THEM 
UP TO TEN PER CENT OF THEIR GLOBAL TURNOVER 
WHICH IN SOME CASES THIS COULD BE 
TENS OF EVEN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS 
OF POUNDS 
WHAT HAPPENS NOW FROM FROM THIS POINT REASONABLE PERIOD OF 
TIME MAYBE THE NEXT SIX MONTHS THE 
TOBACCO COMPANIES AND THE RETAILERS 
WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME 
BACK AND SAY LISTEN WE THINK 
YOU'RE BEING UNFAIR TO US WE 
HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THIS OR YOU'VE 
MISUNDERSTOOD AT THAT POINT THERE 
WILL BE A HEARING IF FINES START 
GETTING DISHED OUT IT PROBABLY 
WON'T BE UNTIL NEXT YEAR WHAT'S 
INTERESTING IS THAT THIS IS ONE OF 
A NUMBER THE OFT IS IN OVERDRIVE 
AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE TAKING ON 
THE BANKS THE CONSTRUCTION 
INDUSTRY I'M TOLD BY THEM NOT 
THAT THEY'VE DRAFTED IN HUNDREDS OF 
PEOPLE AND ARE GOING AFTER THEM BUT 
THEY'VE STARTED THIS INVESTIGATION 
MANY YEARS AGO AND LOT ARE COMING 
TO HEAD AT THE SAME TIMEPOLICE 
ARE CONTINUING TO QUESTION TWO 
PEOPLE ABOUT THE MURDER OF JAMES 
HUGHES THE SEVERELY DISABLED MAN 
WHOSE BODY WAS DISCOVERED AT HIS 
HOME IN REDDITCH ON WEDNESDAY IT'S 
UNDERSTOOD THAT ONE OF THOSE BEING 
QUESTIONED IS BRIAN KIRBY THE 
PARTNER OF MR. HUGHES' MOTHER 
HEATHER WARDLE SHE WAS FOUND DEAD 
IN NEARBY WOODS ON MONDAY ANTHONY 
BARTRAM IS THERE FOR THUS MORNING 
I UNDERSTAND THERE HAVE BEEN 
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PAST FEW 
MINUTES ANTHONY 
YES WE'VE JUST 
HAD IT CONFIRMED BY WEST MERCIA 
POLICE THAT THEY'LL BE GOING TO THE 
MAGISTRATES THIS MORNING AT ONE THOUSAND 
TO ASK FOR AN EXTENSION FURTHER 
TIME TO QUESTION THOSE TWO IN 
CUSTODY THAT COULD BE UP TO SEVENTY TWO 
HOURS WHICH WOULD TAKE US UP TO 
MONDAY MORNING THESE TWO ONE OF 
WHOM IS BELIEVED TO BE BRIAN KIRBY 
THE STEPFATHER OF JAMES HUGHES 
HAVE BEEN IN CUSTODY SINCE 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON SO CLEARLY 
DETECTIVES IN THIS INVESTIGATION 
STILL HAVE QUITE A NUMBER OF 
QUESTIONS THEY STILL WANT TO ASK 
THAT'S SUPPORTED BY A LETTER GOING 
OUT TO THE COMMUNITY HERE TODAY 
ASKING THEM TO BEAR WITH THE POLICE 
BUT WARNING THEM THAT THIS IS STILL 
AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION AND IT'S 
LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN THIS AREA FOR 
SEVERAL DAYS 
A LOT OF SPECULATION 
LOCALLY I KNOW ABOUT THE 
DISCOVERY OF JAMES HUGHES' BODY 
SUGGESTIONS IT WAS FOUND IN A 
SUITCASE WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 
ABOUT THAT 
IT IS JUST THAT AT THE 
MOMENT A SUGGESTION THERE ARE A 
NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS REPORTING THAT 
THIS MORNING THIS IS A COMMUNITY 
THAT HAS HAD TO COME TO TERMS WITH 
A GREAT DEAL OF FAIRLY GRUESOME 
INFORMATION OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS 
A LOT OF SPECULATION HERE AS TO 
WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED L. THINK A 
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TRYING AS HARD AS 
THEY CAN JUST TO STICK TO THE FACTS 
AND LISTEN TO WHAT THE POLICE ARE 
TELLING THEM THIS HAS BEEN QUITE A 
FAST MOVING INVESTIGATION OVER THE 
LAST FEW DAYS OF COURSE IT BEGAN 
WITH A MISSING PERSONS INQUIRY 
EVERYBODY WAS PINNING THEIR HOPES 
TO HAVING A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME BUT 
OF COURSE THEY'VE HAD THOSE HOPES 
DASHED ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS 
NOW NOW THEY'RE HAVING TO COME TO 
TERMS WITH THE DIFFICULT NEWS THAT 
THERE'S A MURDER INQUIRY AND A 
MURDER SCENE RIGHT ON THEIR 
DOORSTEP AN ALLEGED MURDER SCENE 
OF COURSE THESE TWO MEN IN CUSTODY 
HELD ON SUSPICION NO CHARGES AT 
THIS STAGE 
A STUDY SUGGESTS THAT AT LEAST SEVENTY PER CENT 
OF ALL TWELVE AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLS 
WILL BE INOCULATED AGAINST THE 
VIRUS WHICH CAUSES CERVICAL CANCER 
WHEN THE NEW VACCINE PROGRAMME 
BEGINS LATER THIS YEAR RESEARCH 
PUBLISHED IN THE BRITISH MEDICAL 
JOURNAL CLAIMS VERY FEW PARENTS ARE 
WORRIED THAT THE JAB WILL LEAD TO 
THEIR DAUGHTERS HAVING SEX 
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS IN A FEW 
MINUTES' TIME SPEAKING LIVE TO ONE 
OF THE LEADING CANCER CHARITIES 
THE C. I. A. HAS RELEASED PHOTOS OF WHAT 
SAY WAS A SECRET NUCLEAR 
REACTOR BEING BUILT IN SYRIA 
AMERICA HAS ACCUSED NORTH KOREA OF 
HELPING THE SYRIANS TO BUILD THE 
PLANT WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN 
DESTROYED BY ISRAELI WARPLANES 
SYRIA HAS DISMISSED THE CLAIM AS 
RIDICULOUS SEVEN FRESH EFFORTS ARE 
BEING MADE TO PERSUADE MOTORISTS IN 
SCOTLAND TO AVOID PANIC BUYING FUEL 
AHEAD OF SUNDAY'S PLANNED STRIKE AT 
THE GRANGEMOUTH OIL REFINERY 
RETAILERS SAY THERE'S AT LEAST SEVENTY 
DAYS' SUPPLY AS LONG AS DRIVERS 
REMAIN CALMARE DRIVERS STAYING 
CALM 
IT'S A MIXED PICTURE CALM THROUGHOUT SCOTLAND L. PASSED A FEW 
PETROL STATIONS THIS MORNING AND 
EVERY ONE OF THEM HAD RUN OUT OF 
ONE FORM OF PETROL OR ANOTHER BUT 
THEY WERE ALL EXPECTING SUPPLIES 
LATER TODAY IT SHOULD STAY FINE 
SHROENGS BUYERS CONTINUE BUYING 
THEIR PETROL AND DIESEL AS LONG 
AS BUYERS CONTINUE BUYING THEIR 
PETROL AND DIESEL AT THE NORMAL 
RATE 
THEY BEGAN CLOSING DOWN THE RATE MAIN GRANGEMOUTH SITE LAST MONDAY 
AN OPERATION WHICH WILL BE 
COMPLETED BY TOMORROW NORMALLY THE 
PLANT PROCESSES TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND BARRELS OF 
OIL A DAY TURNING IT INTO PETROL 
AND DIESEL FOR MOST OF SCOTLAND 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND PARTS OF 
NORTHERN ENGLAND THE SHUTDOWN HAS 
PROMPTED LOCALISED SHORTAGES OF 
FUEL AT PUMPS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL 
AREAS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE AREAS PANICKING FILLING UP THE QUEUES 
HAVE BEEN BIG TODAY THEY'RE THEY'RE LIMITING IT TO TWENTY A GO THAT'S 
QUITE FAIR 
WE'VE JUST BEEN TAKING 
IT EASY GOING INTO THE PETROL 
STATION WHEN WE'RE NEEDING IT AND 
USUALLY GETTING MORE PETROL BUT BUT FOR THE MOST PART MOTORISTS APPEAR 
TO HAVE HEEDED THE CALL NOT TO 
INDULGE IN PANIC BUYING U. K. AND 
SCOTTISH MINISTERS SAY THERE IS 
MORE THAN ENOUGH FUEL IN THE SYSTEM 
TO LAST WELL INTO NEXT MONTH 
THERE ARE CONCERNS HOWEVER THAT 
THE SHUTDOWN COULD DISRUPT SUPPLIES 
INTO A NEARBY BP PLANT WHICH 
COLLECTS NEAR A THIRD U. K.'S CRUDE 
OIL OUTPUT FROM THE SEA 
IF THOSE 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND BARRELS A DAY WERE TO BE 
SHUT IN THAT'S A LOSS TO THE 
NATION OF ABOUT FIFTY MILLION A DAY 
THAT'S THE ECONOMIC IMIMPACT ON THE 
NATION OF THAT OVER ONE MILLION AN 
HOUR IS PAID IN TAX

INVASION TO PROMISCUITY 
YES AN 
INOCULATION AGAINST THE H. G. V. VIRUS 
RESEARCH SHOWS THE MAJORITY OF 
PARENTS WOULD BE HAPPY FOR THEIR 
DAUGHTERS TO HAVE THE JAB LET'S 
SPEAK TO SAMANTHA FROM THE CANCER 
CHARITY JO'S TRUST GOOD AFTERNOON 
THERE WAS CONCERN WHEN THE 
VACCINATION PROGRAMME WAS SUGGESTED 
THAT GIVING GIRLS OF THIS AGE A JAB 
WHICH WOULD PROTECT THEM FROM 
CERVICAL CANCER COULD ENCOURAGE 
PROMISCUITY ALTHOUGH CRITICS SAY 
THAT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE PICKED 
UP BY PARENTS 
I'M PLEEGSD AT THE 
RESEARCH FINDINGS THAT AT THIS THIS 
ONE SPURIOUS MYTH MAY BE REFUTED 
THREE YEARS AGO WE DID A POLL TO 
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS SOME PARENTS 
MAY HAVE AND WE DIDN'T FIND THAT 
THEN THREE PER CENT OF PARENTS WERE THE SMALL 
PERPS AGE WHO HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT 
IT'S A VERY SPURIOUS CLAIM 
IF YOU EXPLAIN WHERE THAT CAME FROM 
WHERE DID THAT NOTION COME FROM 
PEOPLE'S WORRIES ABOUT THE LINK 
WITH PROMISCUITY 
PROBABLY BECAUSE 
BEFORE THE EIGHTIES WE DIDN'T REALISE 
WHAT THE SPECIFIC CAUSE OF CERVICAL 
CANCER WAS WE KNOW IT IS A UNIQUE 
CANCER AND CAUSED BY A VIRUS WHICH 
IS SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED THROUGH 
SKIN TO SKIN CONTACT IN THE GENITAL 
AREA AND THAT CONDOMS DO NOT GARPB 
TIE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT GUARANTEE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
PROTECTION THIS IS WHY THE 
VACCINATION PROGRAMME IS SO 
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT 
IN THE STUDY SEVENTY PER CENT OF ALL TWELVE AND THIRTEEN 
YEAR OLDS WILL GET INOCULATED THAT 
MEANS ACCORDING TO THE STUDY THIRTY PER CENT 
WON'T IS THAT FIGURE THAT CAUSES 
YOU ANY CONCERN 
WELL IT IS L. 
THINK THIS RESEARCH IS VERY TIMELY 
BECAUSE THE VACCINATION PROGRAMME T. 
SHOWS TWO THINGS IT HIGHLIGHTS THE 
ACCEPTABILITY OF PARENTS OF THE 
VACCINE AS WELL AS THE FEASIBILITY 
OF THE SCHOOLS BASED PROGRAMME 
WHICH JO'S TRUST CAMPAIGNED FOR 
ALSO I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY 
IMPORTANT THAT WE KNOW JUST THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS VACCINE IT 
WILL PREVENT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF ALL CERVICAL 
CANCERS THROUGH PROTECTION AGAINST 
TYPES SIXTEEN AND EIGHTEEN AND THAT WILL BE 
I HOPE THIS RESEARCH ENCOURAGES 
PARENTS TO VACCINATE THEIR 
DAUGHTERS AGAINST AND THAT YOUNG 
WOMEN WILL ATTEND FOR THEIR 
VACCINATION AS WELL 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO 
THAT THIRTY PER CENT WHAT'S THE REASON IS 
THERE AN INSTINCTIVE THING ABOUT 
PEOPLE NOT WANTING ANY KIND OF 
INOCULATION A WHAT'S THE REASONING 
THERE IT SOUNDS LIKE A NO BRAINER 
ON THE FACE OF IT 
IT IS L. THINK 
THERE ARE TWO FACTORS ONE WE HAVE 
TO RE ENGAGE THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL 
THAT HAS LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE 
BENEFITS OF VACCINATION L. THINK 
IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT L. SAW 
ANNE KEEN ON YOUR SOFA IN OCTOBER 
STATING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF 
HEALTH WOULD HAVE AN EDUCATION 
AWARENESS CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD 
OUTLINE THE CAUSES OF CERVICAL 
CANCER THE BENEFITS OF VACCINATION 
AND THE CHALLENGE OF THE SCREENING 
PROGRAMME TO ENCOURAGE GIRLS TO 
CONTINUE ATTENDING SCREENING

THAT'S ALL 
THE SPORT FROM ME HAVE A LOVELY 
WEEKEND OF SPORT OR WHATEVER YOU 
ARE DOING AND I'LL SEE YOU NEXT 
WEEK WEEK NOW DO YOU KNOW YOUR PLACE WE MAY 
BE MORE SOCIALLY MOBILE THAN EVER 
BEFORE BUT IT SEEMS WE HAVE AN 
INSTINCTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE 
WE STAND IN THE SOCIAL PECKING 
ORDER SCIENTISTS CLAIM TO HAVE 
PINPOINTED AN AREA OF OUR BRAIN 
WHICH LEAPS INTO ACTION WHENEVER WE 
MEET SOMEONE FROM A DIFFERENT CLASS 
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE 
DELIA WHEEL 
CONSISTWRITE WHO 
DELIA THE MOCK CONSISTWRITE WHO TUDOR SEMI DETACHED ON THE CORNER 
YOU KNOW THE ONE THEY'VE JUST 
ADDED A GAMES ROOM ABOVE THEIR 
GARAGE THE ONE THING I CAN'T STAND 
IT'S SNOBBERY AND ONE UP 
MANSHIPNESS PEOPLE WHO TRY TO 
PRETEND THEY ARE SUPERIOR IT MAKES 
IT SO MUCH HARDER FOR THOSE WHO 
REALLY ARE 
SHE CAN'T STAND SNOBBERY 
LET'S SPEAK TO PSYCHOLOGIST LINDA 
PAPADOPOULOS AND THE FORMER 
CONTENDER IN THE APPRENTICE NICKLE 
LACEY BROWN NIGEL DE LACY BROWN 
NOW LINDA SCIENTISTS CLAIM THERE 
IS SOMETHING THAT LEAPS INTO ACTION 
IN OUR BRAIN WHEN WE MEET PEOPLE 
FROM ANOTHER SOCIAL STANDING IS 
THAT LEARNT OR AUTOMATIC 
WELL IT 
IS PROBABLY FROM EVOLUTION BECAUSE 
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT EVEN AS 
CAVEMEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO KNOW WHO 
THE ALPHA MALE WAS IN ORDER TO 
EITHER APPROACH THEM AND SUCK UP 
TO THEM OR TO BE AGGRESSIVE 
TOWARDS THEM TO BE ABLE TO MOVE ON 
AND PROTECT YOURSELF 
BUT IN THOSE DAYS IT COULD BE 
BECAUSE YOU COULD BE WHACKED OR NOT 
GIVEN FOOD THESE DAYS IT IS 
DIFFERENT HOW DO WE KNOW WE ARE IN 
A DIFFERENT CLASS TO OTHERS WELL WELL SOME PEOPLE IT IS A NAME WHETHER 
YOU HAVE DOCTOR IN FRONT OF YOUR NAME 
OR HAVE A HIGHER INCOME BUT FOR 
OTHERS IT COULD BE WHETHER THEY ARE 
A SOCIAL PERSON IN A PARTY OR GIVE 
A LOT TO CHARITY AND ALL THESE 
THINGS VARY FROM CULTURE TO CULTURE 
FOR INSTANCE IN THE AC DEMOCRATIC 
CIRCLES IT COULD BE SOMEBODY WHO 
PUBLISHES A LOT OF WORK AND IN THE 
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY SOMEBODY 
WHO MAKES A LOT OF MACHINE 
AND YOU 
CHANGED YOUR NAME TO DE LACY BROWN 
BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE PUTS YOU INTO 
A DIFFERENT SOCIAL CLASS CAN YOU 
EXPLAIN THAT IN 
WE ALL WORK VERY 
HARD BUT MORE THAN EVER TODAY 
WITH SO MANY PEOPLE GOING TO 
UNIVERSITY AND SO ON I DIDN'T 
CONSIDER WORKING HARD ENOUGH TO BE 
ENOUGH SO I ADDED A PREVIOUS FAMILY 
NAME TO MY CURRENT NAME JUST TO BE 
MORE RECOGNISED AND TO SOME EXTENT 
IT HAS WORKED L. L. AM SITTING HERE TO DO 
DO 
YOU REALLY ATTRIBUTE TO WHAT DO YOU HAVE ACHIEVED SO FAR TO HAVING 
DE LACY IN YOUR NAME IT CAN'T CAN 
IT JUST BY ADDING A NAME YOU'RE A 
BIGGER AND BETTER PERSON 
NO THERE 
ARE HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF 
SUCCESSFUL INDIVIDUALS WHO JUST 
DON'T GET NOTICED IT IS THAT 
INITIAL STEP ONCE YOU ARE THROUGH 
THE DOOR YOU CAN REPRESENT YOURSELF 
AS A PERSON AND SHOW OF THE SKILLS 
THAT YOU REALLY HAVE 
LINDA DOES IT REALLY HAVE AN 
IMPACT ON SOMEBODY IF NICHOLAS WAS 
JUST NICHOLAS BROWN IF HE PUTS DE 
LACY IN IT GIVES PEOPLE THE IDEA 
THAT HE HAS DIFFERENT SOCIAL CLASS 
IT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT BUT CLASS MORE IMPORTANTLY IT IS THE IMPACT 
ON NICHOLAS BECAUSE IF HE FEELS 
MORE CONFIDENT WITH THE DOUBLE 
BABBLED NAME HE WILL PRESENT 
HIMSELF BETTER AND HE WILL FEEL 
MORE CONFIDENCE IT IS ALL TO DO 
WITH CONFIDENCE AND HIREBACKIES IF 
YOU GO IN THERE THINKING YOU KNOW 
WHAT YOU WILL LIKE ME AND YOU WILL 
LISTEN TO ME 
THE IDEA ABOUT HYACINTH BUCKET IT 
DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING IN HER CLASS 
DID IT 
CAN MAY NOT BUT AGAIN IF 
PEOPLE SIGNIFY WHERE YOU COME FROM 
WITH YOUR NAME FOR INSTANCE IN 
INDIA YOUR SURNAME CAN MEAN YOU 
ARE A SHOPKEEPER OR A MERCHANT OR 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT CAN HELP 
YOU YOURSELF ARE DOCTOR BUT YOU 
DON'T USE IT DO YOU 
WELL IF I 
WAS AT A CONFERENCE OR SOMETHING I 
WOULD USE IT 
DO YOU DISTINGUISH YOURSELF BY 
CALLING YOURSELF SIR OR WOULD YOU 
THINK THAT WAS TOO FAR DOWN THE 
LINE OF POMPOSITY 
YES I THINK IT 
IS A LITTLE TOO FAR L. DON'T THINK 
WE SHOULD BE POMPOUS ABOUT THESE 
THINGS THAT IS TOO FAR IT IS ONE 
THING GETTING NOTICED THE SOCIAL 
STEREOTYPE THAT IS A LINKED TO 
THINGS LIKE NAMES ARE SOMEWHAT 
NEGATIVE THERE IS A LOT OF 
INVERTED SNOBBERY AND I WOULDN'T 
WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT SO I 
CERTAINLY WOULDN'T GO DOWN THE LINE 
OF PRETENDING I'M ARISTOCRATIC 
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE IS A 
PLACE FOR THAT IN TODAY'S SOCIETY 
IT IS INTERESTING LOTS OF PEOPLE 
GETTING IN TOUCH 
ON THE DOUBLE BARRELLED THING ONE 
SAYING NOWADAYS IT IS MORE OFTEN 
THE CASE OF UNMARRIED PARENTS 
UNABLE TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS SO 
THEY COMBINE THE TWO NAMES 
CAN BOXING IMPROVE PEOPLE'S 
BEHAVIOUR THIS CHARITY IN LONDON 
THINKS SO IT OFFICIALLY OPENS IN 
LONDON THIS WEEKEND BUT A FEW 
CHILDREN WE'VE SPOKEN TO WHO HAVE 
BEEN TAKING PART CERTAINLY SEEM TO 
BE ENJOYING IT 
IF PEOPLE HAVE GOT NOTHING TO DO 
THEY WILL FIND SOMETHING TO DO 
WHICH CAN GET THEM IN TROUBLE IF 
THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR PEACE THERE 
IS RULES AND EVERYTHING AND THEY 
HAVE TO STAY WITHIN THE RULES 
INSTEAD OF WASTING MY TIME ON THE 
STREETS I COME HERE TO LEARN 
SOMETHING TO BOX 
BASICALLY I COME HERE SO I WON'T 
GET INTO TROUBLE ON THE STREETS AND 
STUFF STUFF THEY TEACH US NOT TO FIGHT ON 
STREETS WE GET INVOLVED IN NO 
STREET FIGHTS NO GANG WARS OR 
NOTHING LIKE THAT 
BOXING IS NOT ALL ABOUT VIOLENCE 
IT IS ABOUT DISCIPLINE AND EDUCATION 
HERE AND LET OUT YOUR 
YOU COME HERE AND LET OUT YOUR BOXING YOU CAN TAKE YOUR ANGER ON 
THE PUNCHING BAG INSTEAD OF CAUSING 
TROUBLE ON THE STREETS 
I'M DELIGHTED THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT 
BOXING CHAMPION IS HERE 
WLADIMIR KLITSCHKO WHY DO YOU 
SUPPORT THIS SCHEME 
BECAUSE IT IS 
IMPORTANT FOR THE YOUTH KIDS AGED 
BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWENTY ONE THEY ARE VERY 
ENERGYIC AND AROUND THE WORLD WE 
HAVE CRIME AND VIOLENCE ESPECIALLY 
FROM THOSE KIDS AND IT IS IMPORTANT 
THAT IN EAST LONDON WE GIVE THEM A 
CHANCE TO FIGHT FOR PEACE SO SOME 
KIDS WHO ARE NOT SELF CONFIDENT 
THEN THEY CAN GO TO THE BOXING GYM 
AND GET THIS CONFIDENCE FOR OTHER 
KIDS WHO ARE OVERAGGRESSIVE SO THEY 
CAN LEAD YEAR THERE IS GOOD 
CHAMPLES NELSON MANDELA WAS A GOOD 
BOXER AS WELL 
IT IS FIGHTING ISN'T IT HOW DOES 
THAT HELP PEOPLE GET ALONG WITH 
EACH OTHER 
IT HELPS A LOT BECAUSE 
KIDS ARE LEARNING THE LIMITS IN THE 
GYM AND THEY'RE LEARNING THE RULES 
AND THEY LEARN HOW TO RESPECT EACH 
OTHER AND THE OTHER PERSON AND HOW 
TO RESPECT YOURSELF AND I THINK IT 
IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT SUCH A 
PROJECT WILL GROW AND EXPLODE 
AROUND THE COUNTRY NOT ONLY IN 
LONDON AND ALSO AROUND THE WORLD 
BECAUSE SPORT AS NELSON MANDELA 
SAID HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE THE 
WORLD WORLD THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR FORTHCOMING 
FIGHT FIGHT YOU STARTED THE PROJECT IN BRAZIL 
AND BROUGHT BROUGHT IT HEREMENT 
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN BRAZIL I I STARTED THE PROJECT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND 
AND WE HAVE HAD OVER TWO THOUSAND KIDS IN 
THE PROGRAMME WE HAVE HAD KIDS 
THAT HAVE COME INTO THE PROGRAMME 
WHO WERE HEAVILY INVOLVED IN GANGS 
AND DRUG TRAFFICKING AND WHO ARE 
ROLE MODELS FOR OTHER KIDS IN THE 
COMMUNITY BOXING IS VERY IMPORTANT 
IT IS THE PLATFORM WE ARE LUCKY TO 
HAVE WLADIMIR KLITSCHKO HERE WE 
ARE ALL ABOUT EDUCATION WE ARE 
RUNNING EDUCATION COURSES HERE WE 
ARE ABOUT MENTORING AND GO GIVING 
KIDS THE SUPPORT STRUCTURES THEY 
NEED SO THAT THEY CAN BLOSSOM AND 
BE POSITIVE AND BE ALL THEY CAN BE 
WHAT ABOUT THE SAFETY ASPECT THE 
IDEA OF ELEVEN YEAR OLDS TAKING 
PART IN BOXING IS NOT SOMETHING 
THEY WOULD BE KEEN ABOUT WHAT'S 
YOUR SNKS WHAT'S YOUR REACTION I I WAS AN EXAMATEUR MYSELF BOXING IS 
AN OLYMPIC PORT IT PRO SPORT IT 
PRODUCED ICONS A LOT OF THE KIDS 
THAT COME HERE DON'T GO ANYWHERE 
NEAR CONTACT SPORTS AND IT IS ONLY 
WHEN THEY START GETTING BETTER THAT 
THEY START LOOKING TO COMPETITION 
FOR THEM ALL KIDS ARE WELCOME AT 
THIS CLUB WHETHER THEY WANT TO BE 
WORLD CHAMPIONS OR WHETHER THEY 
DON'T WANT TO GET IN THE RING 
WHETHER IT IS ABOUT FITNESS OR 
STAYING POSITIVE 
YOU RECEIVED AN M. B. E. 
FIGHT FOR PEACE MADE DIFFERENCE 
TO THE LIVES OF PEOPLE IN BRAZIL 
THE HOPE IS IT WILL DO THE SAME FOR 
THE KIDS IN THE EAST LONDON 
WE WILL LOOK AT THE LATEST NEWS 
FROM THE COURTS ABOUT WHAT UNFAIR 
BANK CHARGES COULD MEAN FOR YOU 
NOW THE WEATHER 
GOOD GOOD GROWING WEATHER OVER THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS 
MILD BUT THERE WILL BE RAIN THE 
RAIN IS LIMITED TOWARDS THE WESTERN 
FRINGES OF THE U. K. FOR MUCH OF THE 
COUNTRY IT IS DRY START TO TO 
FRIDAY AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT IS A 
BRIGHT ONE AS WELL WITH SUNSHINE 
POSSIBLE JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE 
THE REASON WHY IT IS CLOUDIER IN 
THE WEST YOU WILL NOTICE ON THE 
SATELLITE PICTURE THE STREAM OF 
CLOUD PUSHING FROM THE ATLANTIC AND 
IT IS BRINGING MURKY CONDITIONS 
RAIN WILL DEVELOP DURING THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF 
OF THE RAIN 
WILL BE HEAVY AND PERSISTENT 
THE HEAVIEST IN THE EAST OF THE 
COUNTRY COUNTRY FOR SCOTLAND DRY AND BRIGHT TURN 
WETTER ELSE ELSEWHERE 
SOUTH OF THE GREATER MANCHESTER 
SOUTH YORKSHIRE AREAS THERE WILL 
BE A LOT OF DRY WEATHER THERE 
COULD BE ONE OR TWO LIGHT SHOWERS 
AND MORE CLOUD THAN RECENT DAYS 
BUT IT WON'T TAKE MUCH OF A CLOUD 
BREAK TO PUSH THE TEMPERATURES UP 
TO SEVENTEEN CELSIUS 
IT WILL ALWAYS REMAIN DAMP AND 
DRIZZLY TOWARDS THE WEST ACROSS THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND ACROSS 
WALES SOME HILL AND 
THE POSTAL FOG POSSIBILITY 
THROUGH THE DAY AND MORE OF 
BREEZE DURING THE AFTERNOON COMING 
IN FROM A SOUTH OR SOUTH WESTERLY 
DIRECTION IT IS THE SOUTH WESTERLY 
WIND THROUGH TONIGHT WHICH BRINGS 
RAIN AND WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES UP 
NICELY AND IT WILL CONTINUE INTO 
TOMORROW ONCE WE SEE MORE CLOUD 
BREAKS TOMORROW ACROSS CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND ALSO EASTERN 
WALES IT WILL BE A WARMER DAY 
TEMPERATURES PEAKING AT TWENTY ONE CELSIUS 
COOLER BUT MILD FURTHER NORTH WITH 
RAIN FOR SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND 
AND NORTH WEST ENGLAND AND NORTH 
WEST WALES 
SUNDAY WE TAKE THE RAIN SOUTHWARDS 
AND EASTWARDS A GOOD PART OF 
ENGLAND AS WELL 
BUT STILL TEMPERATURE NOT TOO BAD 
AT THIRTEEN TO SEVENTEEN CELSIUS 
FORGET POP IDOL AND FAME ACADEMY 
THE LATEST GROUP WITH THE X. FACTOR 
HAVE SOMEONE MORE POWERFUL THAN 
SIMON THREE PRIESTS FROM NORTHERN 
IRELAND HAVE SIGNED A ONE MILLION 
DEAL AFTER BEING SPOTTED BY TALENT 
SCOUTS CHRIS BUCKLEY REPORTS 
THEY ARE NOT A BOY BAND BUT COULD 
THIS BE THE U. K.'S NEXT SUPER GROUP 
THIS IS TWO THIRDS OF THE PRIESTS 
SONY'S LATEST SIGNING WHO WERE 
SPOTTED BY TALENT SCOUTS 
WE DIDN'T TAKE PART IN COMPETITIONS 
WE WERE DISCOVERED FOR WANT OF A 
BETTER WORD WE HAVE BEEN SINGING 
FOR YEARS AND SINGING IS SO MUCH A 
PART OF OUR LIVES WE HAVE BEEN 
SINGING SINCE WE WERE 
THROUGH SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY AND 
THROUGH OUR PRIESTLY MINISTER DWLIS 
AND MINISTRIES AND HAS LANDED ON 
US US THE SIGNING OF THIS DEAL WAS A 
WHOLE NEW EXPERIENCE REALLY 
SOMETHING WE ARE NOT USED TO AT ALL 
THE PRIESTS WENT TO LONDON TO SIGN 
THE ONE MILLION CONTRACT THE MONEY 
THEY MAKE WILL BE GIVEN TO CHARITY 
YESTERDAY WAS THE FIRST TIME MANY 
PARISHERS FOUND OUT ABOUT THE BIG 
MONEY DEAL AND THEY SAY THEY ARE 
GETTING USED TO THE IDEA THAT THEY 
MIGHT SEE THEIR PARISH PRIESTS NAME 
NOT JUST ON AN ORDER OF SERVICE 
BUT ALSO IN THE ALBUM 
CHARTS 
THE THE IT BRINGS THE CHURCH INTO 
SERVICES WHICH IS GOOD 
A RECORD DEAL IS SOMETHING ELSE 
IT IT IS IS IT COULD CHANGE THEIR LIVES 
WELL IF YOU SEE ME DRIVING UP IN 
AN OPEN TOPPED CAT LACK WHEN I 
WOULD GET WORRIED DON'T THINK 
THAT WILL HAPPEN 
THEIR CONTRACT HAS TERMS THAT 
PREVENTS INTERFERENCE WITH THE DAY 
JOB OR THE SUNDAY JOB 
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU ARE 
PAYING OUT MORE AS THE BANK SEND 
YOU WARNING LETTER THAT MAYBE 
ABOUT TO CHANGE CUSTOMERS HAVE WON 
THE FIRST STEP IN WHAT LOOKS LIKELY 
TO BE LONG BATTLE 
JASMINE BIRTLES IS HERE TO EXPLAIN 
WHAT IT MEANS 
WHAT HAVE THE CUSTOMERS BEEN 
COMPLAINING ABOUT 
WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE UNFAIR 
CHARGES SO IF YOU GO OVERDRAWN 
FURTHER THAN THE OVERDRAFT YOU ARE 
ALLOWED QUITE OFTEN PEOPLE ARE 
CHARGED UP TO THIRTY NINE FOR DOING THAT 
YOU GET A LETTER FROM THE BANK AND 
GET CHARGED TWENTY FIVE FOR LETTER A LOT 
OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS IS UNFAIR 
BECAUSE ACTUALLY IT ONLY COSTS THE 
BANK TWO SO THE CHARGES ARE UNFAIR 
WHAT HAS CHANGED NOW AN 
INVESTIGATION CAN HAPPEN YES YES BASICALLY THIS RULING DOESN'T SAY 
WHETHER THE CHARGES ARE FAIR OR NOT 
THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING CAN 
FIGHT THE BATTLE UNDER THE TERMS OF 
THE UNFAIR TERMS IN CONSUMER 
CONTRACTS ACT SO THEY ARE SAYING 
THERE IS AN ISSUE THE BANLTION 
WERE THE BANKS WERE SAYING IT 
WEAN AN ISSUE OF FAIRNESS BECAUSE 
THEY WERE OFFERING A SERVICE AND 
THE TERMS WERE CLEARLY SET OUT THE 
JUDGE SAID THE OFFICE OF FAIR 
TRADING IS RIGHT THAT IT CAN BE 
JUDGED UNDER THIS ACT 
HOWEVER THIS IS LIKELY TO BE A 
LONG DRAWN OUT BATTLE 
YES THE 
OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING WILL BE 
SCOURING THE BANKS TERMS AND THIS 
IS GOING TO GO TO COURT WHICH IS 
PROBABLY GOING TO BE AROUND JULY 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER SORT 
OF RULING THERE 
IF THE BANKS DO ACTUALLY FAIL THIS 
THEN IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL 
APPEAL AND THEY MAY TAKE IT TO THE 
HOUSE OF LORDS SO IT COULD DRAG ON 
INTO NEXT YEAR 
LOOKING AT THE END GAME IF THEY 
LOSE THE BANKS THEY WILL BE 
FORCED TO PAY OUT TO ANYONE WHO HAS 
BEEN CHARGED FOR AN OVERDRAFT 
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY GOING OVER THEIR OVERDRAFT 
FACILITY 
IT IS CHARGES SIX YEARS FACILITY BACK AS WELL SO THEY ARE LOOKING AT 
HUNDREDS 
OF MILLIONS THAT 
THEY ARE THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO 
HAVE TO PAY OUT THEY HAVE ALREADY 
PAID OUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION THERE IS 
ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION PENDING AND WHO 
KNOWS THERE WILL BE MORE PROBABLY 
LATER THEY ARE EXPECTING A LOT OF 
THEM PRIVATELY ARE EXPECTING TO 
LOSE AND THEY ARE EXPECTING TO HAVE 
TO PAY THIS OUT WHO KNOWS THEY 
MAY NOT THEY MAY NOT HAVE TO THEY 
MAY WIN BUT THEY COULD HAVE TO PAY 
ALL THIS 
IS THERE A CONCERN IF THE BANKS 
LOSE AND THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO 
CHARGE FEES FOR THINGS LIKE THIS 
THAT OTHER FEES MAYBE INTRODUCED 
ELSEWHERE THAT WE MAY SEE THE END 
OF FREE BANKING AND HAVE TO PAY 
CHARGES REGULARLY 
THIS IS WHAT THE 
BANKS ARE SAYING AND SOME 
COMMENTATORS ARE SAYING THAT WE 
COULD SEE THE END OF FREE BANKING 
FOR THOSE WHO STAY IN CREDIT AND 
NEVER GO OVERDRAWN THEY MAY HAVE 
TO EVERYBODY MAY HAVE TO PAY 
MONTHLY CHARGES FOR HAVING A BANK 
ACCOUNT MAY HAVE TO PAY FOR TAKING 
CASH OUT OF AN A. T. M. NOBODY REALLY 
KNOWS SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS 
IS JUST THE BANKS SAYING THIS IS 
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN SO DON'T 
FIGHT TOO HARD BUT ON THE OTHER 
HAND THIS IS ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE BILLION 
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOSING 
EACH YEAR THEY ARE GOING TO WANT 
TO RECOUP IT SOMEWHERE 
THANK 
YOU FOR EXPLAINING THAT 
THANK YOU

WAS GIGING HERE AT MASSONIC SKAL 
LODGE ON HILL STREET THIS IS VERY 
FUNNY FUNNY IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT LOOKED WHEN 
IT WAS A VENUE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY 
THERE WAS BLACK CURTAINING AND ALL 
THAT SORT OF THING AND IT WAS DARK 
DO YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I LOOKED 
LIKE LIKE I CAN STILL DO THAT MOVE AS WELL 
CONTORTIONISM IS ONE OF YOUR 
SKILLS 
I WON'T DO IT NOW BECAUSE SKILLS I HAVE ON A SKIRT 
AND HOLY TIGHTS AND BREAKFAST IS NOT THE PLACE BUT BUT CONTORTION IS ONE THING BUT YOU 
LOOK LIKE YOU HAD A MULLET 
YES I 
THINK I LOOK SLIGHTLY BETTER NOW 
YOUR MAKE UP DEPARTMENT HAS DONE A 
WONDERFUL JOB L. HAVE VERY POOR 
HAIR BUT YOU CAN D. THINGS WITH IT 
AND THE WHOLE DO THINGS WITH IT 
AND YOU WON THE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE PERRIER AWARD 
YES I THINK THEY GOT FED UP WITH 
ME SCRATCHING ON THE DOOR SAYING 
LET ME WIN IT'S MY TURN I KEPT 
COMING BACK AND BACK AND BACK AND 
I THINK IT WAS A TIME WHEN THEY 
DIDN'T KNOW WHO TO GIVE IT TO AND 
THEY FELT THE POOR COW KEPT COMING 
BACK AND AWARDED IT TO ME 
LET'S LOOK AT IT NOW 
I AM THE OLD 
DOG OF THE CIRCUIT 
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE 
THEY COULDN'T NOT GIVE IT TO A 
WOMAN IT WAS GETTING EMBARRASSING 
LEE EVANS WAS DOING THE PRESENTING 
AND HE STARTED SAYING THIS STUFF 
ABOUT IT'S NOT ABOUT A ONE HIT 
WONDER AND I THOUGHT OH AND HE 
SAID IT'S ABOUT COMING BACK TIME 
AND TIME AGAIN AND I THOUGHT 
THIS IS MY THIRTEENTH YEAR 
AND PLEASE 
WELCOME ON TO THE STAGE THIS YEAR'S 
WINNER JENNY ECLAIR 
MY NAME WAS 
ANNOUNCED IT WENT IN SLOW MOTION 
IT WAS FLASHBULBS AND BOTTLES OF 
CHAMPAGNE AND A GLORIOUS MOMENT 
APART FROM THE BABY'S HEAD CROWNING 
UP THAT POINT IT WAS ONE OF THE 
BEST MOMENTS OF MY LIFE 
I LOVED 
THE TRIP 
I LOOKED LIKE I'D ALREADY 
BEEN OUT ALL NIGHT 
IT WAS PROBABLY 
A LONG NIGHT 
IT WAS AND I HAD TO 
HITCH A LIFT HOME BECAUSE I WAS 
WEARING SHOES HALF A SIZE TOO SMALL 
BECAUSE WOMEN DO THAT AND MY FEET 
WERE BLEEDING BUT THAT WAS FUNNY 
I LOVED THE STUMBLE L. HAVEN'T SEEN 
THAT BEFORE 
AND YOU TALKED ABOUT 
HAVING A LOW PATCH 
I THINK THAT'S 
WOMEN WHEN YOU WIN SOMETHING YOU 
WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING THINKING 
I DON'T DESERVE IT I DON'T LIKE 
IT I WANT TO GIVE IT BACK AND 
ONCE YOU'VE ONE SOMETHING PEOPLE 
EXPECT YOU TO BE GOOD IT'S BETTER 
TO BE THE BANKY AT THE BACK OF THE 
RACE AND EVERYBODY IS SAYING COME 
ON DONKEY COME ON AND THEN YOU'RE 
EXPECTED TO BE THE THOROUGHBRED 
RACE HORSE AND DOING THE CANTERING 
ACTUALLY I DO CANTER ON THE 
PROGRAMME 
IS THAT WHAT THE ACT NOW PROGRAMME CONSISTS OF YOU PRETENDING TO BE A 
PONY 
YES AND THERE IS SOME PONY SHOWJUMPING NO THERE ARE LOTS OF 
DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE SHOW BUT I 
DID GET THIS SICK FEELING OF 
RESPONSIBILITY WHERE I THOUGHT OH 
NO I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO LIVE UP 
TO NOW YOU SEE I THINK MOST MEN 
THINK THEY DESERVE IT AND WOMEN 
HAVE THIS TERRIBLE SNIVLING BIT 
ABOUT OH I DON'T DESERVE IT 
BUT I'VE GOT OVER THAT NOW 
AND YOU 
WANT THE TO GET IT AND YOU GOT IT 
YES AND THEN WHAT DO YOU DO NEXT 
BUT DID YOU FEEL YOU HAD A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO FUNNY WOMEN AS 
WELL AS A REPRESENTATIVE 
AH THAT 
THING SORT OF IT IS A STRANGE 
THING NOW BECAUSE OH THIS IS 
AN ODD ONE ISN'T IT L. FEEL LIKE 
IT IS A GOOD THING TO AN FUNNY 
WOMAN BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY 
DREADFUL ROLE MODELS FOR YOUNG 
GIRLS WHERE THEY JUST HAVE TO HAVE 
ENORMOUS KNOCKERS AND NO BODY HAIR 
SO IT IS GOOD TO HAVE AN 
ALTERNATIVE TO SAY TO GIRLS THERE 
IS ANOTHER WAY OF LIVING YOU 
DON'T HAVE TO CONFORM TO THE SOPY 
PRISSY LAUGHTERING AT BOYS L. FIND 
IT SO DISAPPOINTING WHEN PEOPLE 
SAY OH SO AND SO IS A ROLE 
MODEL AND I THINK NO SHE IS 
NOT SHE IS JUST A FOOTBALLER'S 
WIFE AND I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE 
OH I'M GETTING GOING NOW WHEN 
PEOPLE SAY THEY'VE WRITTEN BOOKS 
AND THEY HAVEN'T THEY HAVEN'T 
ACTUALLY SAT DOWN AT A TYPEWRITER 
TO WRITE IT 
YOU'RE GETTING INTO YOUR GRUMPY OLD 
WOMAN MOULD 
OH I'M SORRY BUT YOU 
SEE HILARIOUS TWELVE YEAR OLDS WHO 
SUDDENLY STOP BEING FUNNY AT FOURTEEN
