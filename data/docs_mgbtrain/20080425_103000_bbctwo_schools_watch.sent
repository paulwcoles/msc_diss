WATCH WATCH 
WATCH THE PROGRAMME 
HELLO I'M SCRAP SCRAP'S MY NAME BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M MADE OF 
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK NOT TOO CLOSE 
THAT'S BETTER I'M MADE UP OF SCRAP THINGS YOU FIND LYING AROUND 
SWEET PAPERS BITS OF CLOTH AND BUTTONS 
STICKING BITS OF SCRAP TOGETHER IS CALLED COLLAGE READY TO FIND OUT MORE 
LET'S START THE ART AND IT'S OVER TO YOU 
HELLO MY NAME'S OLIVER THIS IS MY PAPER COLLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW HOW I MADE IT 
TO MAKE MY COLLAGE I NEED 
SOME GLUE A SPREADER AND A PAPER ISLAND 
AN OLD MAGAZINE SCISSORS AND A CLOTH 
I'VE GOT SOME PRINTED PAPER 
COLOURED PAPER PAPER THAT I DESIGNED MYSELF 
I PUT MY FINGER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAPER 
I'M SPREADING IT ON THE EDGES 
I'M PUTTING A BIG PURPLE SQUARE RIGHT HERE 
THIS TIME I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME PRINTED PAPER 
I'M GOING TO CUT OUT A TRIANGLE 
I LIKE MY TRIANGLE MADE OUT OF BRICKS 
IT LOOKS LIKE A PYRAMID 
AND THERE IT IS FINISHED 
I REALLY LIKE MY PAPER COLLAGE 
HANG ON I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A SEC 
THAT'S BETTER WHAT A MESS 
THE STICKY GLUE SPREAD ALL OVER THE SCRAP 
A GOOD IDEA IS TO KEEP THE GLUE POT WELL AWAY FROM THE SCRAP MATERIAL 
I CAN FEEL A HANDY HINT COMING ON 
TO KEEP THE GLUE AWAY FROM THE MATERIAL YOU'RE GOING TO STICK 
PUT A LINE DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE 
ONE SIDE'S THE STICKY SIDE AND THAT'S WHERE YOUR GLUE AND SPREADER LIVE 
THE OTHER SIDE IS THE CLEAN SIDE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU KEEP YOUR SCRAP MATERIAL 
REMEMBER IF YOU'RE MAKING A COLLAGE PUT A LINE DOWN YOUR DESK 
KEEP THE GLUE TO ONE SIDE AND YOU WON'T MAKE A MESS 
SCRAP COMES IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES 
IT CAN LOOK DIFFERENT IT CAN FEEL DIFFERENT IT CAN HAVE DIFFERENT TEXTURES 
I WAS CHECKING MY OWN TEXTURES MY BODY FEELS CRINKLY AND MY HEAD FEELS SOFT WHY NOT MAKE YOUR OWN 
HELLO MY NAME'S RUBY THIS IS MY TEXTURE BIRD 
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW I MADE IT 
I'M GOING TO USE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TEXTURES TO MAKE MY BIRD 
FIRST I'M GOING TO USE THIS FOR THE HEAD COS IT'S GOT NICE COLOURS ON IT 
I PUT MY FINGER IN THE MIDDLE AND SPREAD THE GLUE OUTWARDS 
NOW I STICK IT DOWN 
THEN I CLEAN MY HANDS AND TURN MY NEWSPAPER OVER 
NOW I'M GOING TO CHOOSE SOMETHING FOR THE BODY 
IT FEELS SOFT AND SILKY 
I'M GONNA STICK IT HERE BECAUSE THAT'S THE HEAD AND THAT'S THE BODY 
I LOOKED AT A BIRD AND THAT'S WHERE THE BODY GOES 
I'M GONNA CHOOSE SOMETHING HARD THIS TIME 
COS THEN IT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT 
I TEAR VERY CAREFULLY 
I'M GONNA STICK IT HERE 
I PRESS REALLY HARD 
I'VE GOT TO FIND SOMETHING FOR THE HEAD 
HERE'S SOMETHING SHALL I USE THE YELLOW ONE OR THE RED ONE 
I THINK I SHOULD USE THE YELLOW ONE 
I'LL STICK IT DOWN 
NOW I'VE FINISHED 
LOOK AT THIS WHOEVER STUCK ME TOGETHER DIDN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB 
I'LL JUST POP THIS BACK ON WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO STICK THINGS DOWN 
I CAN FEEL A HANDY HINT COMING ON 
TAKE YOUR PIECE OF SCRAP AND PUT IT ON YOUR MAGAZINE 
PUT YOUR FINGER IN THE MIDDLE AND SPREAD THE GLUE OUTWARDS 
YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK FOR MORE 
WHEN YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH GLUE ON YOUR SCRAP CAREFULLY STICK IT DOWN ON THE CARD 
BUT LOOK AT YOUR FINGERS 
IT'S NOT EASY MAKING COLLAGE WITH STICKY FINGERS SO WIPE THEM ON THE CLOTH 
WHEN THE STICKING IS THROUGH WIPE YOUR FINGERS FREE OF GLUE 
I'M TRYING TO SORT ALL THIS SCRAP OUT 
ALL THE PAPER GOES HERE SHINY THINGS HERE AND THIS IS FOR FABRIC 
YOU CAN GET SCRAP FROM ALMOST ANYWHERE LET'S START THE ART 
AND THIS TIME IT'S STUDIO ART 
HELLO MY NAME'S JAYNE THIS IS MY MERMAID WITH A COLLAGE TAIL I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW I MADE IT 
FIRST I PAINT IN THE SEA AND THE MERMAID 
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL I'VE ALWAYS LOVED MERMAIDS 
THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THESE CREATURES OF COURSE I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE 
TO MAKE HER TAIL I'M GOING TO USE COLLAGE 
INSIDE THIS FRIDGE IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HELP ME WITH MY COLLAGE 
THIS FISH WILL GIVE ME A GOOD IDEA OF HOW TO MAKE HER TAIL 
I CAN LOOK CLOSELY AT THE COLOURS AND THE TEXTURES 
I'M GOING TO USE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAPER FOR MY MERMAID'S TAIL 
I ALWAYS TEAR MY PAPER RATHER THAN CUTTING IT WITH SCISSORS 
I LIKE THE JAGGED EDGES YOU GET FROM TORN PAPER 
THIS IS NICE THE SURFACE OF THIS PAPER LOOKS LIKE SCALES ON A FISH 
I THINK IT WORKS WELL HERE 
IF I STICK THIS SHINY PAPER DOWN IT BEGINS TO LOOK LIKE THE SHINY SURFACE OF THE TAIL 
BUT I THINK IT DOESN'T LOOK QUITE RIGHT YET IT LOOKS TOO SHINY 
BY COVERING PART OF IT WITH THIS GREEN TISSUE PAPER IT LOOKS MUCH SOFTER 
LOOK AT THIS THIS HAPPENS QUITE A LOT MY PAPERS HAVE GOT IN A MUDDLE 
TIME TO DO SOME SORTING TISSUE PAPER GOES IN HERE 
PRINTED PAPER IN HERE 
AND MY LOVELY SHINY FOILS GO IN HERE 
AND NOW FOR SOME FINISHING TOUCHES 
I'LL GIVE HER A SHELL NECKLACE 
AND FINALLY I THINK SHE NEEDS SOME GOLD HAIR 
SO THERE SHE IS FINISHED MY MERMAID WITH A COLLAGE TAIL
