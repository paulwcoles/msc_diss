HAS LEFT FAMILIES WITHOUT HOT WATER 
AND STRUGGLING TO STAY WARM 
WHY YOU'LL STILL PAY OVER THE ODDS FOR USING YOUR MOBILE ABROAD 
HOW LONG CAN THE PHONE COMPANIES GET AWAY WITH IT 
AND NEVER MIND THE BAGGAGE WHERE IS MY CAR 
THE LATEST PROBLEM AT TERMINAL FIVE 
THAT'S WATCHDOG TONIGHT 
HELLO WELCOME TO WATCHDOG LIVE FROM THE OFFICE WHERE THIS WEEK 
WE HAVE HAD SOME TERRIFIC RESULTS ON YOUR BEHALF 
SAVING SOME OF YOU THOUSANDS OF POUNDS 
MOST OF THAT IS TO DO WITH THE SUMS YOUR PHONE COMPANY CAN CHARGE YOU FOR USING YOUR MOBILE ABROAD 
NOT FOR CALLS THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN FORCED TO CUT THE COST OF THOSE BUT FOR SOMETHING ELSE 
YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THE SIZE OF SOME OF THE BILLS WHOPPERS 
PLUS HOW JULES AND HER SOGGY SWIMSUIT GOT CAUGHT UP IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST STORIES OF THE TIME 
THE CHAOS AT TERMINAL FIVE BIG NEWS 
IT'S SAFE TO SAY YOU WERE NOT IMPRESSED ME AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS CHAOS 
AS IF THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH PROBLEMS WE ARE GOING TO REVEAL ANOTHER ONE TO DO WITH PARKING 
YOU CAN TEXT US ON ANY OF THE STORIES JUST TYPE 
OR YOU CAN E. MAIL OR CALL US THE DETAILS ARE ON THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW 
WE'LL READ THEM OUT LATER 
FIRST MORE PROBLEMS WITH THE DVLA WHAT'S THE STORY THIS TIME 
WELL NOT ABOUT HANDING OVER YOUR DETAILS BUT ABOUT GETTING THOSE DETAILS WRONG 
FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING DETAILS OF YOU AND YOUR MOTOR 
TODAY THE DVLA HOLDS THE INFORMATION OF FORTY TWO MILLION OF US ON A FLASH NEW COMPUTER SYSTEM 
WHICH SHOULD MEAN THEIR RECORDS ARE PRECISE AND UP TO DATE AS POSSIBLE 
THEY CLAIM THEIR DATABASE IS SO ACCURATE THEY KNOW EXACTLY 
WHO OWNS WHICH CAR AND WHETHER THEY HAVE PAID CAR TAX 
THE DVLA COMPUTER KNOWS 
IF YOU HAVE RENEWED YOUR CAR TAX 
AND IT KNOWS IF YOU HAVEN'T 
THAT IS WHY THEY BOAST 
AND THEY ARE RIGHT THERE IS NO ESCAPING THE DVLA'S COMPUTER 
EVEN WHEN IT'S WRONG 
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE BEING FINED FOR NOT PAYING TAX 
ON CARS THEY HAVE NOT OWNED FOR MONTHS 
THIS IS PETER TRUEMAN LAST SEPTEMBER HE DECIDED TO TRADE IN HIS OLD CAR FOR A NEW ONE 
HE WROTE TO THE DVLA TO SAY HE WAS NO LONGER THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE 
AND TO CLAIM BACK SIX MONTHS OF HIS CAR TAX 
I COMPLETED THE FORM 
COMPLETE WITH ALL THE OTHER DOCUMENTS FOR THE OLD CAR 
AND SENT IT TO THE DVLA 
PETER GOT HIS TAX REFUND A FEW WEEKS LATER WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF IT 
BUT LAST MONTH THE DVLA SAID THEY'D FINE HIM EIGHTY FOR HAVING NO CAR TAX 
ON THE CAR HE HAD TOLD THEM HE HAD SOLD THEY CLAIMED 
THEY'D NOT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION THAT THE CAR WAS NO LONGER HIS HE SENT MORE PROOF BUT THEY WOULD NOT BUDGE 
THEY BASICALLY SAID TO ME WE DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND YOU'RE STILL ELIGIBLE FOR THE FINE 
I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE IT I REALLY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT 
THE WAY I WAS BEING TREATED BY THIS ORGANISATION WHEN I KNEW I WAS IN THE RIGHT 
THE DVLA SAID IF HE PAID UP IMMEDIATELY THEY WOULD HALVE THE FINE 
BUT IF HE DID NOT HE WOULD BE TAKEN TO COURT 
IT'S TOTALLY UNFAIR 
YOU'VE GOT TO PAY YOUR FINE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T 
WHAT CHANCE DO YOU STAND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU WILL BE IN COURT 
IT SEEMS THE DVLA'S COMPUTER CANNOT ALWAYS KEEP UP WITH THE BASICS LIKE WHO OWNS YOUR CAR NOW 
EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE SENT YOU A LETTER CONFIRMING THEY KNOW YOU DON'T 
THE COMPUTER CAN STILL SEND YOU A FINE YOU JUST DON'T DESERVE 
LAST SEPTEMBER KATHRYN BRADY'S CAR WAS WRITTEN OFF AFTER AN ACCIDENT 
I HAD TO FILL OUT A DECLARATION NOTIFYING THE DVLA 
THAT THE CAR HAD BEEN WRITTEN OFF AND WAS NO LONGER ON THE ROAD 
AT THE SAME TIME YOU DECLARE THAT YOU WANT A REFUND OF THE TAX DISC ON THE SAME FORM 
SHE RECEIVED HER A REFUND AND A LETTER CONFIRMING THAT THE DVLA'S RECORDS HAD BEEN UPDATED 
TO SHOW THAT THE CAR HAD BEEN SCRAPPED 
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SHE HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN 
MUCH TO MY SHOCK I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THEM AT THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER 
FINING ME EIGHTY I WAS VERY ANGRY AND UPSET 
KATHRYN CONTACTED THE DVLA TO REMIND THEM THAT THEY HAD ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED 
THAT HER CAR WAS SCRAPPED 
THEY ADVISED THAT UNLESS I COULD PRODUCE THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT LETTER 
THEY WOULD BE FINING ME AND UNFORTUNATELY I HAD MISPLACED THIS LETTER 
KATHRYN ASSUMED THE DVLA WOULD HAVE A RECORD OF THE LETTER 
WHICH AFTER ALL THEY HAD WRITTEN AND SENT TO HER 
BUT THE DVLA SAID THEY DID NOT AND UNLESS THEY COULD SEE HER COPY THE FINE STOOD 
RELUCTANTLY KATHRYN PAID SHE HAS SINCE FOUND THE LETTER BUT TOO LATE 
I THINK THE PROCEDURE AT THE DVLA IS APPALLING THEY'RE INFLEXIBLE THERE IS NO RIGHT OF APPEAL 
THEY'RE JUST NOT INTERESTED THEY DON'T CARE THEY'RE JUST FINING YOU AND THAT'S THE END OF THE STORY 
THE DVLA'S NEW COMPUTER SYSTEM WAS INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR TO STOP CAR TAX DODGERS IN ITS FIRST THREE YEARS 
IT HAS HELPED RAISE OVER SIXTY FIVE MILLION IN FINES 
COULD SOME OF THAT BE BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY THE DVLA'S COMPUTER SAYS NO 
THE DVLA'S ENFORCEMENT PROCESS IS RUN BY THE DVLA 
IT IS JUDGE JURY AND EXECUTIONER 
WE AT THE DOUBLE A. HAVE SAID THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT PROCESS 
FOR HEARING APPEALS AGAINST DVLA PENALTIES THAT IS SADLY LACKING AND I THINK IT'S UNFAIR ON PEOPLE 
THE DVLA LOOKS AFTER THE DETAILS OF FORTY TWO MILLION OF US 
THEY HAVE COME UNDER FIRE RECENTLY FOR LOSING SOME OF THEM AND SELLING THEM TO JUST ABOUT ANYBODY 
BUT THE ONE THING WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPECT IS THAT THEY HAVE GOT THOSE DETAILS RIGHT 
IT'S NO GOOD TELLING US WE CANNOT ESCAPE THE COMPUTER IF THE COMPUTER HAS GOT IT WRONG 
WELL THE DVLA WOULD NOT COMMENT ON INDIVIDUAL CASES 
BUT THEY APOLOGISE IF MISTAKES HAVE BEEN MADE THEY ARE VERY CONFIDENT IN THEIR PENALTY SYSTEM 
AND REITERATE THAT DRIVERS ARE LEGALLY OBLIGED TO TELL THEM ABOUT RELEVANT CHANGES 
WHICH OF COURSE IS WHAT BOTH PEOPLE IN OUR FILM INSIST THEY DID 
THEY SAY YOU'LL NEED WRITTEN EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE NOT LIABLE 
AND A KEY PART OF THAT IS THE LETTER KATHRYN LOST 
IF SHE AND PETER CONTACT THEM THEY'LL LOOK AT THEIR SITUATIONS AGAIN 
AND SO THEY SHOULD NEXT WE SENT PAUL HEINEY ON A TRIP ABROAD 
TO INVESTIGATE HOW YOU CAN GET A MOBILE PHONE BILL FOR NINE GRAND OUCH 
THE TRAVEL ESSENTIALS 
TICKETS PASSPORT 
AND YES YOUR MOBILE PHONE 
MOST OF US WOULDN'T DREAM OF GOING ABROAD WITHOUT IT 
AND WHILE IT USED TO COST A FORTUNE TO PHONE HOME FROM EUROPE THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE 
LAST JUNE THE E. U. FORCED THE PHONE COMPANIES TO CUT THEIR CHARGES 
WHICH DROPPED BY SEVENTY PER CENT BUT THAT WAS JUST FOR CALLS AND TODAY'S MOBILES DO SO MUCH MORE 
WITH THE LATEST PHONES YOU CAN GO ONLINE CHECK YOUR E. MAILS 
SOME EVEN BOAST IT IS THE INTERNET IN YOUR POCKET 
BUT YOUR POCKET MAY NOT LIKE WHAT'S COMING NEXT 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE COST OF DOING ANY OF THOSE THINGS FROM ABROAD 
THE PHONE COMPANIES ARE STILL SHOWING A LITTLE J. E. N. E. SAIS QUOI 
WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER DAWN SWIFT 
TOOK HER MOBILE WITH HER WHEN SHE WENT ON A WEEK'S HOLIDAY TO MAJORCA LAST YEAR 
BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO USE ITS INTERNET FACILITY TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH HER CLIENTS 
WE DID NOT USE THE INTERNET AN AWFUL LOT WHEN WE WERE AWAY 
WE ONLY USED IT A FEW MINUTES 
EACH DAY TO RECEIVE AND ANSWER E. MAILS 
AT ONE POINT ONE DID DOWNLOAD GOOGLE EARTH JUST TO GET MY BEARINGS ON MAJORCA 
BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT THE USAGE WAS VERY LIMITED 
WHAT SHE DID NOT REALISE WAS HOW MUCH THEY WOULD CHARGE HER FOR USING HER MOBILE TO GO ONLINE 
WHAT THE NETWORKS CALL DATA ROAMING 
IN THE U. K. THE COST OF THAT IS INCLUDED IN HER MONTHLY TARIFF 
BUT BECAUSE SHE WAS IN SPAIN T. MOBILE CHARGED HER EXTRA A LOT EXTRA 
THOSE FEW MINUTES SURFING EVERY DAY HAD COST DAWN OVER FIVE HUNDRED 
MUCH MORE THAN SHE PAID FOR HER HOLIDAY 
I FELT LIKE I HAD BEEN ROBBED 
IT WAS THE SAME KIND OF FEELING YOU HAVE WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAS HAPPENED 
AND YOU KNOW THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT 
YOU JUST FEEL KIND OF SICK AND YOU KNOW SHOCKED AND QUITE UPSET 
PLENTY OF OTHER TRAVELLERS HAVE FALLEN INTO THE SAME TRAP 
AND IT IS EASY FOR THE MOBILE COMPANIES TO GET AWAY WITH IT 
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH ORDINARY CALLS ARE CHARGED BY THE SECOND 
WHEN YOU GO ONLINE YOU ARE BILLED IN MEGABYTES 
AND ABROAD THEY'RE MEGA EXPENSIVE 
KEEPING TRACK OF YOUR HOLIDAY SPENDING CAN BE CONFUSING ENOUGH 
EVEN IF IT IS ONLY WORKING OUT THE COST OF YOUR COFFEE AND CROISSANT 
BUT AT LEAST YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH 
BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING MEGABYTES HOW CAN YOU TELL 
WHEN YOU HAVE BITTEN OFF A LOT MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO CHEW 
DAVID POPE WENT ON A FAMILY SKIING HOLIDAY TO FRANCE LAST YEAR TAKING WITH HIM 
ONE OF THESE HANDY LITTLE GADGETS PLUG IT INTO HIS LAPTOP 
AND HE IS INSTANTLY ONLINE WITH THE COST GOING THROUGH HIS MOBILE PHONE BILL AND WHAT A BILL IT WAS 
I HOOKED IT ALL UP 
AND I DID SOME BROWSING AND ANSWERED SOME E. MAILS FROM WORK 
AND STARTED TO PLAY A COMPUTER GAME 
BUT AS THE APRES SKI GAMES CONTINUED 
DAVID STARTED TO WORRY ABOUT THE COST 
HE LOOKED UP THE VODAFONE WEBSITE AND SAW IT WAS FIVE POINT SIX OH PER MEGABYTE 
BUT HE HAD NO IDEA HOW MANY MEGABYTES THEY HAD USED UNTIL HE GOT BACK FROM SKIING 
AND GOT A BILL FOR ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT POINT FIVE THREE 
ENOUGH TO SEND ANYONE OFF PISTE 
IT WAS SHEER TERROR WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FOR FOUR OR FIVE HOURS' USE 
WHEN IN THE U. K. IT WOULD HAVE COST ME EIGHT POINT FIVE OH THAT STRIKES ME AS AN EXTORTIONATE AMOUNT OF MONEY 
DAVID COMPLAINED TO VODAFONE WHO AGREED TO REDUCE HIS BILL BUT ONLY BY THREE HUNDRED 
HE STILL HAS TO FORK OUT ONE THOUSAND 
VODAFONE HAS NOW REDUCED ITS DATA ROAMING COSTS 
BUT MOST OF THE U. K.'S OTHER MOBILE COMPANIES STILL HAVE THESE HIGH CHARGES 
REGULATOR OFCOM SAYS ALL PHONE COMPANIES 
SHOULD BRING THESE CHARGES DOWN 
ROAMING IS A GREAT CAPABILITY THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
TO BE ABLE TO USE SERVICES ABROAD 
BUT WE HEAR STORIES OF INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS BEING CHARGED HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF POUNDS 
BY ANY MEASURE THAT IS NOT REASONABLE AND NOT ACCEPTABLE 
WHETHER YOU'RE A BELGIAN IN BRITAIN OR A BRIT IN BELGIUM THE SITUATION IS EXACTLY THE SAME 
AND IT IS SCANDALOUS YOUR PHONE COMPANY CAN CHARGE YOU WHATEVER IT LIKES 
FOR THE INFORMATION YOU DOWNLOAD WHEN YOU'RE ABROAD 
THE TRUE COST MAY BE JUST PENNIES 
BUT YOU COULD END UP WITH A BILL FOR THOUSANDS 
SAM BELTON BOUGHT HER SON SEB A WEB'N'WALK PACKAGE FROM T. MOBILE 
ALLOWING HIM UNLIMITED INTERNET ACCESS AT LEAST IN THE U. K. ABROAD IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY 
SEB WENT ONLINE IN AUSTRIA AND DOWNLOADED SOME UPDATES FOR A COMPUTER GAME BUT THE NEXT DAY 
HE GOT A MESSAGE FROM T. MOBILE SAYING HE WAS BEING CHARGED SEVEN POINT FIVE OH FOR EVERY MEGABYTE HE DOWNLOADED 
HE CALLED HIS FATHER SAYING THAT 
HE HAD LITERALLY JUST STUMBLED ACROSS THIS MESSAGE 
AND HE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF 
WHEN SAM RANG T. MOBILE TO FIND OUT WHAT THE BILL WOULD BE 
THEY TOLD HER THE COST WAS A STAGGERING NINE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT ONE TWO 
I JUST REMEMBER HEARING THE NINE THOUSAND AND THE REST WAS JUST A TOTAL AND ABSOLUTE BLUR 
I JUST REMEMBER SAYING YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS THIS IS LUDICROUS 
I DID ACTUALLY CRY 
THAT'S A HELL OF A LOT OF MONEY IT IS A DEPOSIT DOWN ON A HOUSE YOU CAN BUY A CAR 
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WHO WOULD DESCRIBE THESE BILLS AS EXORBITANT 
AMONGST THEM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION 
THEY HAVE GOT TOUGH WITH THE PHONE COMPANIES OVER THEIR CHARGES BEFORE 
AND NOW THEY SAY THEY'LL DO IT AGAIN 
IT'S A RIP OFF OF THE CONSUMER WHO CROSSES THE BORDER AND IN EUROPE 
THESE PRICES HAVE TO GO DOWN 
IF THE MOBILE INDUSTRY DOES NOT BRING DOWN PRICES FOR DATA ROAMING VOLUNTARILY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION 
WILL HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO BRING IN LEGISLATION AGAIN 
AS WE HAVE DONE IT LAST YEAR FOR VOICE ROAMING 
SURF THE WORLD WIDE WEB ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE AND YOU COULD SOON LOSE YOUR APPETITE FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL 
OUR PHONES CAN DO WONDERFUL THINGS BUT RUNNING UP CHARGES NO ONE CAN JUSTIFY OUGHT NOT TO BE ONE OF THEM 
IT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU CHOKE ON YOUR CHIPS OR EVEN YOUR FRITES 
IT WOULD BE WELL VERY GOOD NEWS AFTER WE GOT IN TOUCH 
THE PHONE COMPANIES CANCELLED ALL OF THE BILLS WE HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDING THAT NINE GRAND ONE 
T. MOBILE SAY THEY DO MAKE CUSTOMERS AWARE OF THESE CHARGES 
BUT FROM SUMMER THE E. U.'S DEADLINE THEY WILL BE REDUCING DATA ROAMING RATES BY EIGHTY PER CENT 
THEY'LL BE INTRODUCING AUTOMATIC ALERTS SO THE CUSTOMER WILL HAVE GREATER CONTROL OVER COSTS 
VODAFONE HAVE ALREADY CUT THEIR CHARGES WHICH THEY SAY ARE SOME OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE 
DAVID POPE WAS AFFECTED BECAUSE OF THE PRICE PLAN THAT HE WAS ON THEY ARE SORRY ABOUT THAT 
AND THEY WILL BE RESTRICTING INTERNATIONAL USE FOR EVERYONE WHO IS ON THAT TARIFF 
YOU CANNOT HAVE FAILED TO HAVE SEEN ON THE NEWS THE BAGGAGE CHAOS AT HEATHROW'S NEW TERMINAL FIVE 
I'M PLEASED TO SAY WE CAN TALK EXCLUSIVELY TO ONE OF THE PEOPLE AFFECTED 
WHAT HAPPENED I HAVE JOINED THAT NOT SO EXCLUSIVE CLUB 
ONE OF MY BAGS IS ONE OF THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND BAGS SOMEWHERE AT TERMINAL FIVE 
ALTHOUGH TODAY ESTIMATES SAY THAT THAT NUMBER COULD BE CLOSER TO TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND BAGS 
HERE'S THE RUB THOUGH COMING BACK FROM MY CHANNEL FIVE TRAVEL SHOW 
AND WHAT'S IN THE CASE WHAT'S IN THE CASE 
MY BIKINI OH AND IT'S WET AND DAMP 
IN A PLASTIC BAG IN A PLASTIC BAG THAT'S ONE THING 
HOW WAS THE INFORMATION 
THAT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MISINFORMATION 
SOME PEOPLE WERE TOLD THEIR BAGS WOULD BE ONE HOUR EIGHT HOURS FIFTEEN HOURS 
EVERYBODY IS FRUSTRATED ABOUT NOT HAVING THE RIGHT INFORMATION 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US I WAS IN THE BUILDING 
WELL JULIA BRADBURY BROADCASTER GLOBETROTTER AND CONSUMER CHAMPION 
HAVE WE GOT NEWS FOR YOU HAVE YOU YES WE HAVE HAVE YOU REALLY 
WE WERE MEANT TO HAVE IT RIGHT THERE 
IT IS LIVE TELEVISION AFTER ALL 
BUT PHIL THE FLOOR MANAGER HAS FORGOTTEN TO BRING THE BAG 
IT WAS MEANT TO BE THE BIG MOMENT QUICK PHIL IS IT THERE 
IS THAT IT YES THE BAG HAS ARRIVED 
WELL ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I HOPE THAT EVERYBODY AT HOME IS AS LUCKY AS I AM 
IT'S SO FRUSTRATING THAT'S THE POINT NOT JUST ME I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGISE FOR EVERYBODY 
I AM OFF AGAIN TOMORROW SO IT'S GOOD I'VE GOT MY BIKINI 
LET'S HOPE THOSE OTHER THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE GET THOSE BAGS VERY QUICKLY 
B. A. APOLOGISED TO EVERYONE AFFECTED BY THE DISRUPTION CANCELLATIONS AND LOST BAGGAGE 
THEY TOLD US THEY ARE CURRENTLY SORTING A BACKLOG OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND BAGS 
THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT AS JULES MENTIONED IS SAYING IT IS TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND 
BUT ANYWAY WE CARRY ON IN THE MEANTIME 
ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH TERMINAL FIVE THIS TIME WITH THE CAR PARK 
IT SHOULD BE THE ANSWER TO ONE OF YOUR BIGGEST AIRPORT NIGHTMARES 
A CAR PARK THAT KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE YOU LEFT YOUR CAR WHEN YOU PARKED IT 
I ENTERED THE CAR PARK AS YOU ALWAYS DO I WENT UP A RAMP 
I LOOKED FOR A SPACE I THOUGHT IT IS BUSY OVER HERE THEN I SAW A SPACE SOMEWHERE ELSE 
AND THOUGHT O. K. I'LL GO FOR IT I'LL TAKE THE SPACE 
AND HERE'S THE CLEVER PART WHEN IT'S TIME TO PICK UP YOUR CAR 
YOU TYPE YOUR REGISTRATION NUMBER IN THE NCP SPECIAL CAR FINDER 
AND IT WILL PINPOINT THE PRECISE LOCATION OF YOUR VEHICLE 
SO I TYPED IT IN 
I PUT IN MY CAR REGISTRATION AND HE SAID YOUR CAR IS IN ROW F. K. 
I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT F. K. 
AND I SAID BRILLIANT HE SAID HAVE A LOVELY DAY 
I SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AFTER HALF AN HOUR OF SEARCHING EVERY LEVEL 
JONATHAN HAD TO ASK THE CAR PARK STAFF TO HELP 
IT WAS LIKE A TREASURE HUNT LOOKING FOR THIS CAR 
WE COULDN'T FIND THE CAR THEY CAME BACK AND SAID LOOK I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU 
BUT THE COMPUTER SAID IT'S THERE IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT THERE 
WE'VE LOOKED IT'S NOT THERE SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR CAR'S BEEN STOLEN 
LUCKILY IT HADN'T BEEN AND JONATHAN IS HAPPILY REUNITED WITH HIS CAR 
WHICH HE EVENTUALLY FOUND IN A DIFFERENT SPACE FROM THE ONE HE'D BEEN SENT TO BY THE CAR FINDER 
BUT WE WANTED TO TEST IT FOR OURSELVES SO WE DROVE TO HEATHROW 
AND TERMINAL FIVE LIKE JONATHAN WE DROVE AROUND LOOKING FOR A SPACE 
AND WHEN WE SAW ONE WE GRABBED IT BUT WHEN WE TYPED IN OUR REGISTRATION NUMBER 
WE TOO WERE DIRECTED TO COMPLETELY THE WRONG PLACE 
AND THEN WE WORKED OUT WHY 
YOU ARE DIRECTED AROUND THE CAR PARK BY A SERIES OF ARROWS 
BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS SEND YOU THE QUICKEST WAY TO AN EMPTY SPACE 
WHEN WE FOLLOWED THE ARROWS THE CAR FINDER KEPT TRACK OF OUR CAR 
BUT MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY WOULDN'T PARK THAT WAY 
THEY TAKE THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE ROUTE TO THE NEAREST AVAILABLE SPACE 
AND IT SEEMS THAT IS WHAT CONFUSES THE CAR FINDER 
IT NEVER EVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PARK IT 
AND GO AROUND THE CAR PARK IN SOME SPECIAL WAY 
BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY SAYS SO 
I AM JUST AN ORDINARY DRIVER TRYING TO PARK MY CAR 
WELL B. A. A. SAY SO FAR THE FEEDBACK ON THE CAR FINDER SERVICE HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE 
AS WE THOUGHT THEIR DATA SUGGESTS IF YOU STICK TO THE MARKED ROUTES 
IT WILL CORRECTLY IDENTIFY WHERE YOUR CAR IS PARKED IF IT DOESN'T THERE ARE STAFF ON HAND TO HELP 
NEXT THE GOVERNMENT SCHEME WARM FRONT 
AND HOW IT HAS LEFT PEOPLE WITHOUT HEATING OR HOT WATER RIGHT THROUGH THE WINTER 
NOT VERY WARM 
WE'VE JUST HAD THE COLDEST EASTER IN OVER FORTY YEARS 
PARTICULARLY GRIM FOR THE FORTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS THE U. K. 
WHO LIVE IN FUEL POVERTY 
WHICH MEANS THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP THEIR HOMES WARM 
THAT'S WHERE THE GOVERNMENT'S WARM FRONT SCHEME COMES IN 
IT GIVES GRANTS TO SOME OF THOSE WORST AFFECTED 
PROMISING TO MAKE HOMES WARMER HEALTHIER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT 
BRILLIANT IDEA 
BUT SOMETHING'S GONE BADLY WRONG 
BECAUSE IN THERE THEY'RE UP IN ARMS ABOUT IT 
OVER THE LAST YEAR THE TRICKLE OF CASES COMING ACROSS MY DESK 
HAS TURNED INTO A FLOOD OF COMPLAINTS 
PEOPLE ARE BEING RIPPED OFF 
THE VERY PENSIONERS WHOM WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HELP ARE LOSING MONEY 
RIPPED OFF 
NOT WORDS YOU'D EXPECT TO HEAR ABOUT A SCHEME THE GOVERNMENT SAID WOULD MAKE THINGS BETTER 
TO QUALIFY FOR A WARM FRONT GRANT YOU MUST BE OVER SIXTY 
OR CLAIM CERTAIN BENEFITS AND NEED HELP KEEPING YOUR HOUSE WARM 
THEY SEND SOMEONE ROUND TO ASSESS YOUR PROPERTY 
AND SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS TO HEATING AND INSULATION 
THEN ASSIGN AN APPROVED CONTRACTOR TO CARRY OUT THE WORK 
BUT FOR MARK NEWELL AND HIS FAMILY IT'S BEEN A LOT MORE COMPLICATED 
THEY APPLIED FOR A GRANT IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND THREE 
WE NEEDED A LITTLE BIT OF HELP BECAUSE WE HAVE A LARGE FAMILY 
WHICH CAN BE EXPENSIVE SO A GRANT TOWARDS THE HEATING WAS IDEAL 
WARM FRONT'S CONTRACTOR SAID THE FAMILY'S HEATING SYSTEM SHOULD BE REPLACED 
THEY INSTALLED A NEW ONE AND FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS SINCE 
THE NEWELLS' CENTRAL HEATING HAS NOT WORKED PROPERLY 
WE'VE HAD PROMISE AFTER PROMISE THAT IT WOULD BE PUT RIGHT 
IT HAS PUT A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE FAMILY 
IT'S BEEN A GREAT UPHEAVAL 
THE SYSTEM WAS AT ITS WORST IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
MARK'S WIFE AND CHILDREN HAD TO MOVE INTO RENTED ACCOMMODATION 
BECAUSE THEY HAD NO HEATING OR HOT WATER 
WE HAD NO CHOICE YOU CAN'T LIVE FOR ANY GREAT PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT HOT WATER 
AFTER SIX MONTHS THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO RENT ANY LONGER 
AND HAD TO MOVE BACK HOME 
EVEN THOUGH WARM FRONT STILL HADN'T FIXED THE PROBLEMS 
WE TRAVELLED TO A LEISURE CENTRE TO USE THE SHOWERING FACILITIES 
WARM FRONT'S CONTRACTOR DID EVENTUALLY FIX THE HOT WATER 
BUT THE NEWELLS' HEATING STILL DOESN'T WORK 
IF IT'S REALLY COLD WE ALL SNUGGLE ON THE SOFA UNDER A DUVET 
IF IT GETS REALLY REALLY COLD THEN WE ALL GO OFF TO BED 
I THINK WE'VE BEEN LET DOWN 
WARM FRONT HAVE LET US DOWN TERRIBLY 
WE FIRST FEATURED WARM FRONT ON WATCHDOG IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX 
THE COMPANY THAT RUNS THE SCHEME FOR THE GOVERNMENT EAGA 
TOLD US THEY THOUGHT MOST PEOPLE WERE HAPPY 
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING US 
SINCE THEN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS 
WE'VE RECEIVED ABOUT WARM FRONT HAS NEARLY TREBLED 
WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT SHODDY WORKMANSHIP LONG DELAYS 
AND ONE THING IN PARTICULAR THE COST 
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN A GRANT 
YOU COULD STILL BE PAYING THROUGH THE NOSE 
WARM FRONT'S STANDARD GRANT IS TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED 
BUT IT'S THEIR APPROVED CONTRACTORS WHO WORK OUT HOW MUCH EACH JOB COSTS 
AND OFTEN THEIR QUOTE COMES IN AT MORE THAN THE GRANT 
AND WHEN THEY DO 
IT'S PEOPLE LIKE JUNE WALKER WHO ARE ASKED TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE 
SHE CONTACTED WARM FRONT WHEN THE BACK BOILER BROKE LAST SUMMER 
I WAS REALLY PLEASED WHEN I FOUND OUT I WAS ELIGIBLE FOR THE GRANT 
BECAUSE THE MONEY PROBLEM WENT AWAY 
AND I WAS JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A NICE WARM HOME 
BUT IT WAS SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE WARM FRONT GAVE THEIR QUOTE FOR THE WORK 
THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE LEAVING HER WITHOUT HEATING FOR ALL THAT TIME 
I WAS LITERALLY GOING TO WORK COMING IN DOING MY TEA 
GOING TO BED AND WATCHING T. V. TO KEEP WARM 
JUNE'S SON IN LAW HAD TO LEND HER MONEY TO BUY A GAS FIRE 
THEN IN JANUARY WARM FRONT SAID THEY WOULD INSTALL A NEW BOILER 
AND ONE RADIATOR THE COST OVER THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND MORE THAN THE GRANT 
AND BEFORE THEY'D DO ANY WORK JUNE WOULD HAVE TO PAY UP 
IF I FELT GUTTED WHEN THEY ASKED ME FOR THE ADDITIONAL MONEY 
ONE THOUSAND IS OUT OF THE QUESTION I HAVEN'T GOT THAT MONEY 
FINDING THE EXTRA MONEY TO TOP UP A GRANT ISN'T EASY 
STILL THAT IS THE TRUE COST OF THE JOB 
NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT 
BUT IS IT 
BECAUSE THE QUESTION A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING IS 
ARE SOME WARM FRONT CONTRACTORS CHARGING OVER THE ODDS 
WE ASKED TERRY DE LURY A PROFESSIONAL HEATING CONSULTANT 
TO TAKE A LOOK JUNE'S QUOTE 
IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT THE COST OF THE WORK 
IS REALLY QUITE EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH 
I WOULD HAVE SAID 
AT THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED IT'S ONE ZERO MORE THAN IT SHOULD BE 
PLENTY OF OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOCKED BY THEIR QUOTE FROM WARM FRONT 
THEY'D INSTALLED A CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEM FOR RICHARD WHITTLE 
BUT LAST DECEMBER THE BOILER BROKE DOWN AFTER JUST SEVEN YEARS 
AND THE QUOTE FOR A NEW ONE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED 
THE WHITTLES STILL HAD A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR ORIGINAL GRANT LEFT OVER 
BUT TO GET THIS PRICEY NEW BOILER THEY'D HAVE TO FIND ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED 
THEIR SON WAS HORRIFIED 
WHEN THEY FIRST GAVE US THE ESTIMATE WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT 
THE QUOTE WARM FRONT GAVE US IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS 
RIDICULOUSLY HIGH 
OUR EXPERT AGREED AGAIN HE THINKS THE QUOTE WAS ONE THOUSAND TOO HIGH 
NEITHER OF THE QUOTES I HAVE SEEN AND MANY OF THE OTHERS I'VE SEEN 
HAVEN'T BEEN COMPETITIVE PRICES 
THEY ARE NOT GETTING VALUE FOR MONEY AND THE TAXPAYER ISN'T 
THE WHITTLES DON'T HAVE THE MONEY THAT WARM FRONT HAS ASKED FOR 
AND HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT HEATING OR HOT WATER SINCE BEFORE CHRISTMAS 
THEY HAVE TO TO BOIL WATER IN ORDER TO WASH 
MY CONCERN IS FOR MY PARENTS' HEALTH 
MY DAD IS IN HIS EIGHTIES MY MUM IS IN HER SEVENTIES' 
WE TAKE PANS OF WATER UPSTAIRS 
PUT THEM IN A BIG WASHING BOWL 
WASH OURSELVES DOWN THE BEST WAY WE CAN 
UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN WE GO DOWN TO MY SON'S HOME 
AND WE HAVE SHOWERS THERE 
HELP THE AGED THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL PEOPLE LIKE THE WHITTLES 
CAN BE LEFT IN THIS SITUATION 
THE SCHEME IS STRUGGLING BADLY 
WE CAN SEE THAT FROM THE CALLS WE'RE GETTING 
THE SCHEME SEEMS TO BE TAKING LONGER AND LONGER 
TO GET ROUND TO DOING THE BIT OF WORK WHICH SOMEBODY ACTUALLY NEEDS 
AT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS OLIVER LETWIN IS AMONG THE M. P.'S CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE PRICES WARM FRONT'S CONTRACTORS CAN COME UP WITH 
AND MORE FUNDAMENTALLY 
ABOUT WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT SCHEME IS WORKING AT ALL 
I AM WORRIED WHETHER THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY IS BEING USED WISELY AND WELL 
AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE WRITTEN TO EIGHTY LOCAL CONTRACTORS 
AND TRIED TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE CHARGES THEY WOULD CHARGE 
ARE LESS THAN OR MORE THAN WHAT THE SCHEME CHARGES 
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE 
WHAT WE ALL WANT IS FOR THE SCHEME TO WORK RIGHT 
BECAUSE THERE ARE OLD PEOPLE WITH LACK OF HEATING 
AND THAT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM WE WANT THE MONEY USED AS WELL AS POSSIBLE 
THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO END FUEL POVERTY WITHIN THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS 
BUT IS WARM FRONT REALLY THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT IT 
IT MAY HAVE HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE 
BUT FAR TOO MANY ARE SAYING THIS PARTICULAR GIFT HORSE 
HAS TURNED AROUND AND KICKED THEM IN THE TEETH 
WELL THE ENVIRONMENT MINISTER PHIL WOOLAS SAID TODAY 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH WARM FRONT'S SERVICE 
OVER SIXTEEN MILLION HOUSEHOLDS HAVE BEEN HELPED 
AND HE SAYS LESS THAN OH FIVE PER CENT HAVE REGISTERED A COMPLAINT 
BUT HE'S CONCERNED TO HEAR OUR CASES AND HE WANTS THEM FULLY INVESTIGATED 
WITH ME IS PAUL VARLEY FROM EAGA THE COMPANY THAT RUNS WARM FRONT 
ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT 
HELP THE AGED SAY THE SCHEME IS STRUGGLING BADLY 
M. P.'S ARE CRITICISING IT WHAT HAS GONE WRONG 
PLEASE DON'T SAY NOTHING 
SOMETIMES WE DO GET IT WRONG NICKY 
AND YOU'VE SEEN THAT IN THE VIDEO CASES 
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALISE 
THAT WE FIT A BOILER IN A HOUSE EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY WORKING DAY 
AND IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE HELPED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
IT GOES WRONG IN ABOUT FOUR IN ONE THOUSAND CASES 
THAT'S NINE HUNDRED NINETY SIX PEOPLE IN ONE THOUSAND WHO DO BENEFIT 
WHY ARE COMPLAINTS GOING UP WHY ARE M. P.S' POSTBAGS BULGING 
WHY ARE HELP THE AGED GETTING MORE AND MORE REPORTS ABOUT THIS 
ANSWER THIS STRAIGHT 
ARE SOME WARM FRONT CONTRACTORS CHARGING OVER THE ODDS 
NO THEY AREN'T NICKY 
THE GOVERNMENT CONDUCTED AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT 
OF THE WARM FRONT PROGRAMME 
AND THE GOVERNMENT'S INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR 
SAID THE WARM FRONT SCHEME DELIVERED PRICES ONE THIRD CHEAPER 
THAN THE EQUIVALENT SCHEME SO IF YOU WERE TO BUY A BOILER FROM WARM FRONT 
YOU'D GET IT AT A THIRD OF THE PRICE 
THEY SAID IT WAS EXCELLENT VALUE FOR MONEY SO IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT WE ARE AS YOU SAY OVERCHARGING 
I WONDER IF PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT YOU AS MUCH AS THEY MIGHT 
IF THEY DIDN'T FEEL THEY WERE GETTING HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
LET ME ASK YOU ONE MORE THING 
GIVEN ALL THIS GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE ON YOUR BACK 
AND THE RISING COMPLAINTS 
ARE YOU EAGA THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO BE RUNNING THIS SCHEME 
WE BELIEVE WE ARE AND THE GOVERNMENT'S INDEPENDENT ADVISER AND AUDITOR 
SAYS THAT WE DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY FOR THE SCHEME 
SO ABSOLUTELY WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN TWO YEARS WOULD ALSO SAY WE ARE THE RIGHT PEOPLE 
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT WITH RISING ENERGY PRICES 
WITH PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR BILLS 
PEOPLE CAN APPLY TO WARM FRONT 
WE'LL SEE WHAT OUR VIEWERS SAY THANKS FOR COMING IN THANK YOU 
IF YOU'VE HAD A PROBLEM WITH WARM FRONT YOU CAN CALL THEM FREE TONIGHT 
THAT LINE IS OPEN EVERY DAY BUT TONIGHT UNTIL TEN P. M. AS I SAID 
IF YOU'VE GOT A STORY FOR US YOU CAN E. MAIL US 
OR GIVE US A CALL ON 
THANKS FOR YOUR TEXTS NO TIME FOR US TO READ THEM OUT 
BACK AT THE SAME TIME NEXT WEEK YOUR SWIMSUIT IS BACK NOW I MIGHT WEAR IT SEE YOU NEXT WEEK
