I'M JAKE THIS IS NEWSROUND 
FIND OUT WHY THESE TEACHERS 
REFUSING TO GO TO WORK HAS MEANT A 
GREAT DAY FOR SOME OF YOU 
WHY DESPITE THE DANGERS SOME OF 
YOU ARE STILL SUNING YOURSELF IN 
ONE OF THESE 
USUALLY YOU TUNE INTO NEWSROUND 
AFTER A HARD DAY'S LEARNING BUT 
NOT TODAY LOADS OF SCHOOLS WERE 
SHUT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE TO 
TEACH YOU CLASSES WERE CANCELLED 
OR SOME SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED 
ALTOGETHER WE WILL FIND OUT WHAT 
YOU THINK ABOUT ALL OF THIS FIRST 
HERE IS HELEN TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAS 
BEEN GOING ON 
THOUSANDS OF YOU HAVE HAD THE DAY 
OFF SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THIS STRIKE 
TEACHERS ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
REFUSED TO GO TO CLASS BECAUSE THEY 
THINK THEY SHOULD BE PAID MORE TO 
TEACH YOU 
TEACHERS WORK VERY HARD TO PLAN 
LESSONS FOR CHILDREN AND KEEP THEM 
EXCITING AND THEY DO A LOT OF WORK 
AND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PAY IS NOT 
AS MUCH AS IT SHOULD BE 
IF YOU WANT FAIR PAY CLAP YOUR 
HANDS 
WE ARE PROTESTING TO MAKE THEM GET 
FOUR PER CENT INSTEAD OF TWO PER CENT 
EVERYBODY IS JUST 
TRYING TO GET THE TEACHERS PAID 
MORE 
THEY WILL PROBABLY WORK MORE BETTER BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE MORE 
MONEY MONEY THE TEACHERS WERE PRETTY LOUD BUT 
THOUSANDS OF CLASSROOMS HAVE BEEN 
SILENT ALL DAY ONE EIGHTY SEVEN SCHOOLS IN 
LIVERPOOL MORE THAN NINETY IN CUMBRIA 
ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TEN IN BIRMINGHAM AND HALF OF ALL 
THE SCHOOLS IN WALES HAVE BEEN SHUT 
FOR THE DAY IT'S BEEN SCHOOL AS 
USUAL IF YOU LIVE IN SCOTLAND OR 
NORTHERN IRELAND THOUGH I'M SURE 
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MANY TEACHERS 
IN ONE PLACE BEFORE THAT IS 
BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN SUCH 
BIG WALKOUT FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS THE 
STRIKE HAS PAID OFF FOR LOTS OF YOU 
YOU GOT DAY OFF SCHOOL WE WILL 
HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE IF IT'S BEEN 
ENOUGH TO GET YOUR TEACHERS THE 
DEAL THEY WANT 
YOU HAVE BEEN GETTING IN TOUCH TO 
TELL US WHAT YOU THINK HELEN'S 
HOT FOOTED IT BACK WITH FEW 
COMMENTS WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING I I HAVE BEEN OUT AND YOU HAVE BEEN 
GETTING IN TOUCH TO TELL US WHAT 
YOU HAVE BEEN UP TO TODAY MOLLY 
RECKONS IT IS A GOOD IDEA THAT 
TEACHERS ARE STANDING UP FOR THEIR 
OWN RIGHTS 
KURT IS NOT THAT HAPPY 
TEACHERS AREN'T ON STRIKE IN 
SCOTLAND AND DECLAN RECKONS THAT IS 
A GOOD THING HE TOLD US KATIE IS NOT HAPPY SHE SAYS 
MY MUM HAD TO GIVE UP A DAY OF 
WORK TO LOOK AFTER ME JORDAN 
SAYS 
THANKS FOR YOUR E. MAILS KEEP YOUR 
THOUGHTS COMING IN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH FOR E. MAILING US NEXT UP KIDS 
COULD BE BANNED FROM USING SUNBEDS 
DESPITE WARNINGS THAT TOO MUCH 
TANNING IS BAD FOR YOUR SKIN 
RESEARCH SUGGESTS SOME OF YOU ARE 
STILL STEPPING INTO A TANNING BOOTH 
GETTING TAN USING SUNBED CAN BE 
DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS 
DESPITE THE HEALTH WARNINGS A 
MAGAZINE CALLED WHICH RECKONS 
ACROSS THE U. K. ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN 
AGED BETWEEN EIGHT TO FIFTEEN HAVE BEEN 
SPLASHING THEIR CASH ON SUNBEDS I I THINK THAT CHILDREN USE TANNING 
BEDS BECAUSE THEY LOOK IN MAGAZINES 
AND LOOK AT ALL THE CELEBRITIES AND 
HOW THEY ARE TANNED 
I LIKE GETTING 
A TAN BUT I WOULD NEVER USE A 
SUNBED 
AT THE MOMENT IT ISN'T SUNBED ILLEGAL FOR YOU TO USE ONE OF THESE 
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IS ABOUT TO 
CHANGE KIDS IN SCOTLAND COULD BE 
BANNED FROM BOOTHS LIKE THIS ONE IN 
ABOUT SIX WEEKS' TIME ENGLAND 
COULD FOLLOW THAT IS BECAUSE WHILE 
SOME SALONS DO LISTEN TO SKIN 
EXPERTS AND TURN KIDS AWAY THERE 
ARE PLENTY THAT LET THEM IN THEY THEY AFFECT THE SKIN THEY CAUSE 
WRINKLES AND THEY CAN INCREASE THE 
RISK OF SKIN CANCER IT IS LIKE 
GOING INTO A MICROWAVE I'M NOT 
SURPRISED CHILDREN WANT TO GO INTO 
TANNING SALONS WHEN THEY SEE 
CELEBRITIES DOING IT THIRTEEN YEAR OLD THIRTEEN YEAR OLD KIERON FROM BLAENAU GWENT GOT 
SERIOUSLY BURNT AFTER VISITING A 
TANNING SALON THREE TIMES IN JUST 
ONE DAY WHAT HAPPENED TO KIERON IS 
RARE BUT SHOWS THE DAMAGE SUNBEDS 
CAN DO TO YOU A BIG PART OF THE 
PROBLEM IS COIN OPERATED SUNBEDS 
KIDS CAN WALK IN PUT A COIN IN THE 
SLOT TO MAKE THE MACHINE WORK BUT 
VERY OFTEN THERE IS NO ONE CHECKING 
IF THEY ARE USING IT TOO MUCH THAT 
IS WHY SKIN EXPERTS WANT A TOTAL 
BAN ON KIDS BEING ALLOWED IN A 
TANNING BOOTH TO STOP YOU FROM 
SUNING YOURSELVES WAY TOO MUCH
