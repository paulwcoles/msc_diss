IT TRANSLATES THE THOUGHTS OF CREATURES INTO OUR LANGUAGES 
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY DEVICE WE HAD NO IDEA HUMANS WERE SO INTELLIGENT 
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD IT'S LIFE BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT 
TRANSLATION LENS WE HAVE COME WITH A FEW THINGS OURSELVES 
MEET IN THE INVENTORS 
WELL WHAT A DAY I CAN'T STOP AND CHAT FOR LONG 
WE'RE ON A SCOUTING MISSION FOR THE GIRLS BACK AT THE NEST 
TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND ANYTHING USEFUL 
FAT CHANCE IF YOU ASK ME WHICH YOU DIDN'T BUT I'LL SAY IT ANYWAY 
HUMAN STUFF'S A FEW MILLION YEARS OUT OF DATE 
EVERY BRILLIANT INVENTION THEY'VE COME UP WITH WE'VE HAD FOR EVER 
SOME MIGHT SAY HUMANS HAVE BEEN COPYING OUR WORK 
AND EVEN USING OUR INVENTIONS AGAINST US 
WILL YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THIS TRAGEDY 
WHAT A WAY TO GO BATTERED WITH YOUR OWN INVENTION 
MOVE ALONG I'VE ALREADY READ THIS BIT 
THE WASP INVENTED PAPER AND WHAT DO HUMANS DO WITH IT 
ROLL IT UP AND BASH HER OVER THE HEAD COME ON YOU LOT 
THE LITTLE ONES AT THE NEST ARE IN FOR A WASP FLAVOURED TREAT 
URGH TASTES LIKE BEE STOP PUSHING 
WILL YOU STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO DO TO ME WHAT'S THAT 
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME ABOUT THE WASP INVENTING PAPER 
DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT TALK TO MAN HIMSELF MEN THE CHEEK OF IT 
BUT IT'S TRUE WE PAPER WASPS DID INVENT PAPER 
US GIRLS THAT IS MRS. ANT AND THOSE HUMANS WIPE THEIR BOTTOMS WITH IT 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY LEARNT THEIR MANNERS BUT IT WASN'T IN A NEST 
WHICH IS WHAT PAPER IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR MAKING NESTS 
WALLS ROOFS IT'S TERRIBLY USEFUL 
IT'S WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME 
YOU HAVE TO FIND A NICE SOURCE OF CLEAN WATER AND FILL UP A TANKFUL 
AH 
CHOOSE A PLANT I FIND DEAD ONES THE BEST BUT EACH TO THEIR OWN 
I SCRAP THE FIBRES OFF GET A MOUTHFUL AND SPIT ON IT 
SORRY 
BACK AT THE NEST I MAKE THE SHAPE WITH THE WET PULP 
AND FINALLY SQUEEZE OUT THE SPIT AND WATER DRIES IN NO TIME 
GOSH IT'S TOUGH ONE COULD WORK UP QUITE A SWEAT 
AND INDEED IF THE NEST DOES GET HOT WE DAB A BIT OF WATER 
AND SPIT ONTO THE NEST 
AND FAN IT IT COOLS DOWN THE WHOLE NEST 
AIR CONDITIONING I THINK YOU CALL IT 
SEEMS WE CAME UP WITH IT TWENTY MILLION YEARS AGO BAD LUCK 
THAT'S NOT A BAD EFFORT AT PAPER MAKING 
BUT US COMMON WASPS HAVE GOT IT TOP DOLLY CAN WE HAVE A LOOK AROUND 
THAT'S FINE BUT MAKE IT QUICK WE'VE GOT A CITY TO BUILD 
BY LUNCHTIME 
SHE'S RIGHT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING 
DIGGING OUT A CHAMBER AND BUILDING OUR PAPER NEST INSIDE IT 
OH YOU SPAT ON ME INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT ANYONE GOT A TISSUE 
I'LL USE THE WALL IT'S WORTH GETTING COVERED IN SPIT 
COS LOOK AT THE RESULTS 
HAVE YOU PUT IN THE PILLARS FOR THE THIRD FLOOR 
JUST WAITING FOR THE SPIT TO DRY 
HOUSING FOR TWO THOUSAND AND THE CHILDREN ALL HAVE THEIR OWN ROOMS 
WHO DO I TALK TO ABOUT HAVING A BIGGER ROOM 
AND I BET YOU THOUGHT HUMANS INVENTED MULTI STOREY TOWER BLOCKS 
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU WONDERFUL STUFF PAPER 
CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE SPOIL IT BY WRITING ALL OVER IT 
SILK IS A MUCH FINER MATERIAL TO MAKE YOUR HOUSE OUT OF THAN PAPER 
AND US SPIDERS HAVE BEEN MAKING OUR HOMES SLASH DEATH TRAPS 
OUT OF IT FOR YEARS IT'S STRONGER THAN STEEL 
LIGHTER THAN PAPER IT'S ELASTIC AND YOU CAN EVEN EAT IT 
QUITE A MULTI PURPOSE INVENTION POP BACK LATER WHEN IT'S FINISHED 
AND I'LL HAVE ANOTHER INVENTION TO SHOW YOU RUN ALONG 
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
TOLD YOU US INSECTS WOULD COME UP WITH SOME GOOD STUFF 
TALKING OF SEEING 
I BET THEY THINK THESE BINOCULARS ARE ANOTHER OF THEIR INVENTIONS 
I BET THEY DO WRONG AGAIN 
THERE'S A JUMPING SPIDER RIGHT HERE IN THE SHED WHO'LL TELL YOU AS MUCH 
NOT THAT I CAN SEE HIM I COULD DO WITH BINOCULARS MYSELF 
OH AYE IF ANYONE'S GOT THE ABILITY TO SEE FOR MILES AND MILES IT'S ME 
JUST LIKE BINOCULARS 
MY EYES HAVE VERY POWERFUL LENSES 
WHICH COMES IN HANDY WHEN I'M ON THE PROWL 
SEE THAT WEE FLY OVER THERE ACTUALLY YOU PROBABLY DON'T 
BUT I CAN RIGHT ENOUGH 
THERE'S NO HIDING WHEN PUPILS LIKE MINE HAVE YOU IN THEIR SIGHTS 
I CAN SEE EE YOU ALL RIGHT MATE HOW'S IT GOING 
VERY BADLY FOR YOU

OH AYE IF I'M LOOKING FOR YOU THERE'S NO HIDING 
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD WON'T BE LONG NOW 
THAT AIN'T NOTHING I KNOW SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE ONLY JUST INVENTED

JET PROPULSION I INVENTED THAT AND I'M JUST A KID 
DRAGONFLY LAVA ME CHECK IT OUT

IMPRESSIVE YEAH 
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS I SUCK COLD WATER INTO ME BACKSIDE 
AND WHEN I NEED SOME INSTANT POWER I JUST BLOW IT OUT AGAIN 
YOU KNOW UNDER PRESSURE

DRESSED FOR DINNER MY DINNER 
EXCUSE ME 
OH SORRY YOU'VE COME AT RATHER AN AWKWARD MOMENT 
I'LL SHOW YOU MY INVENTION IN A SECOND JUST DUMP THIS FELLOW HERE 
WE DIGGER WASPS OFTEN FIND THAT WE NEED TO BURY SOMETHING ALIVE 
SO THAT WE CAN LAY AN EGG ON IT 
TO DO THAT 
WE NEED A HOLE 
NOW I VIBRATE MY WINGS 
TO MAKE MY WHOLE BODY 
VIBRATE WHICH LOOSENS SOIL 
AND STUBBORN ROCKS JUST LIKE ONE OF THOSE PNEUMATIC DRILLS 
THAT WORKMEN USE WHEN THEY'RE NOT ON A TEA BREAK 
I DON'T MEAN TO BE PICKY 
BUT SHOULDN'T YOU KILL ME BEFORE YOU BURY ME CERTAINLY NOT 
PARALYSING IS MUCH BETTER 
IT KEEPS YOU FRESH FOR LATER NOW COME INTO MY LARDER 
OH I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO THE PLACE 
POOR JETHRO WHAT A WAY TO GO 
STILL ON THE SUBJECT OF WORK TOOLS I'VE GOT AN EARLY VERSION 
OF THE SAW INVENTED BY US CONEHEAD CRICKETS THAT MAY INTEREST YOU 
FOLLOW ME KEEP UP 
NO DAWDLING 
RIGHT I USE IT FOR CUTTING SLITS IN PLANTS AND STICKS 
SO I'VE GOT A SAFE PLACE TO LAY MY EGGS 
IT'S DEAD CLEVER 
BECAUSE IT'S GOT BLADES POINTING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS 
SO I CUT WHEN IT GOES IN 
AND WHEN IT COMES OUT IMAGINE HAVING A SAW ATTACHED TO YOUR BODY 
H. M. M. IT'S ALMOST LIKE I'M A LIVING BREATHING PENKNIFE 
ONLY WITHOUT THE TOOTHPICK OR THE TWEEZERS OR THOSE RUBBISH SCISSORS 
IT'S TIME I INTRODUCED THE GREATEST INVENTOR ON THE WHOLE PLANET 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I GIVE YOU MYSELF HA HA HA 
I HOPE YOU'RE SITTING COMFORTABLY 
BECAUSE A LIST OF ALL THE ANTS INVENTIONS WILL TAKE A WHILE 
I'LL BE STARTING WITH ROADS 
THAT'S RIGHT BILLIONS OF YEARS BEFORE THE ROMANS BUILT THEIRS 
WE ANTS WERE MAKING OURS 
WE LAY DOWN A SCENT TRAIL USING OUR BOTTOMS 
AND THE REST OF THE NEST FOLLOWS IT 
GIVES A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO WHEE WHEE WHEE ALL THE WAY HOME 
I GUESS WE INVENTED TRAFFIC 
WATCH OUT HONESTLY TAKING ON A STRETCH LIKE THAT 
THE FELLA'S DRIVING LIKE A WOOD LOUSE 
ANYONE ANY IDEA WHERE WE'RE GOING I'M FOLLOWING THE SMELL WHICH WAY 
GET A MOVE ON YOU'RE BLOCKING THE SCENT TRAIL 
MAKE WAY LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING 
HAVE A BIT OF CONSIDERATION FOR OTHERS 
CHECK BOTH WAYS BEFORE PULLING OUT 
YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM ANT RAGE 
THIS IS A ONE WAY SYSTEM YOU EEJIT 
ONE WAY SYSTEMS WE CAME UP WITH THAT TOO 
THAT'S THE HOLD UP WE'RE HEADING INTO THE TUNNEL 
OH YES THAT HOLE THERE THE TUNNEL IS ONE OF OURS AS WELL 
OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T INVENT HOLES IN THE GROUND 
BUT EXCAVATED TUNNELS THAT LEAD WHERE YOU WANT THEM 
WE'LL BE TAKING THE CREDIT FOR THAT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ASKING 
WHICH YOU DIDN'T BUT YOU SHOULD'VE 
TRAFFIC AND ROADS AND TUNNELS IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG LETTUCE 
SO ALLOW ME TO HAND YOU OVER TO MY FRIEND THE GARDEN ANT 
WHO'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT THE FARMING 
THAT I WILL YOU SEE WE FARM WITH APHIDS THOSE LITTLE GREEN THINGS 
JUST LIKE HUMANS DO WITH COWS 
WE HERD THEM INTO GOOD SPOTS AND LOOK AFTER THEM 
JUST LIKE HUMANS DO WITH COWS 
WE COLLECT HONEY DEW FROM THEM WHICH WE DRINK 
JUST LIKE HUMANS DO WITH MILK FROM COWS 
OH IT'S SO SWEET AND SUGARY 
WE EVEN OCCASIONALLY EAT THE APHIDS JUST LIKE HUMANS DO WITH COWS 
WE HAVE TO PROTECT THEM FROM VICIOUS LADYBIRDS 
JUST LIKE HUMANS WELL I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHERE THE SIMILARITY ENDS 
LADYBIRD ATTACK LADYBIRD ATTACK 
GET OFF GO ON CLEAR OFF 
I KNOW WHEN I'M NOT WANTED 
SHOO CLEAR OFF I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE ANYWAY 
ALL RIGHT I CAN TAKE A HINT 
FARMING ROADS EVEN TRAFFIC JAMS 
I CAN'T THINK OF A THING HUMANS CAME UP WITH FOR THEMSELVES 
WHAT ABOUT THAT WASN'T THEM 
DIDN'T THEY COME UP WITH THAT WASN'T THEM EITHER 
UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN YOU ARE WHAT ABOUT THE WHEEL 
YEAH I'LL GIVE THEM THAT 
ATTENTION 
HOLD YOUR HORSES 
WE'RE CLAIMING THE WHEEL PILL MILLIPEDE AT YOUR SERVICE 
GIVE US A DEMONSTRATION CEDRIC YES SIR 
ADOPTING THE POSITION SIR 
OH DEAR

SORT OF WE CURL UP LIKE THAT TO PROTECT OURSELVES 
OOP SORRY 
AGH OH 
I'M FINE I'M FINE 
A BIT DIZZY 
HA HA HA THE PILL MILLIPEDE INVENTED THE WHEEL 
THEY'RE NOT WHEELS THEY'RE JUST A LOAD OF BALLS 
I'M NORMALLY FIRST TO CLAIM INSECTS INVENTED SOMETHING AHEAD OF HUMANS 
BUT EVEN I ADMIT BALLS IS DIFFERENT TO WHEELS 
NO I THINK WE'LL GIVE THE WHEEL TO THE HUMANS BUT THAT'S IT 
IT'S NOT MUCH COMPARED TO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS IT 
THERE'S ONE THING NO ONE'S INVENTED THAT I COULD DO WITH NOW 
IT'S A TIME MACHINE I WAS MEANT TO BE BACK AT THE NEST TWENTY MINUTES AGO 
I BETTER DASH TRAFFIC CAN BE MURDER ON THE ANT ROADS THIS TIME OF DAY 
BYE NOW LOOK AFTER YOURSELF 
HANG ON DID NOBODY THINK TO ASK SNAILS ABOUT INVENTIONS 
DO THE WORDS MOBILE HOME NOT RING ANY BELLS 
THAT'S RIGHT NEXT TIME YOU'RE SAT IN A CARAVAN IN THE POURING RAIN 
IN A WINDSWEPT FIELD IN WALES YOU'VE GOT ME TO THANK 
AND YOU'RE VERY WELCOME OH I NEED A HOLIDAY 
WE NEED A HOLE 
NOW I VIBRATE MY WINGS 
TO MAKE MY WHOLE BODY 
VIBRATE WHICH LOOSENS SOIL
