HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
TONIGHT'S CONCERT FEATURES THE AMERICAN SUPERSTAR SOPRANO 
RENEE FLEMING 
SHE'LL BE SINGING MUSIC BY BERG AND KORNGOLD 
WE'VE ALSO TWO CONTRASTING SYMPHONIES 
BEETHOVEN'S JOYFUL EIGHTH AND SCHUMANN'S SECOND SYMPHONY 
A TRIUMPH OF HOPE OVER ADVERSITY 
WELL WAITING ON STAGE NOW IS THE B. B. C. PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA 
AND FIRST THIS EVENING WE'RE GOING TO HEAR BEETHOVEN'S EIGHTH SYMPHONY 
IT'S A PIECE THAT'S TRADITIONALLY BEEN LESS PERFORMED THAN 
SAY THE FIFTH THE PASTORAL SIXTH OR THE NINTH SYMPHONY 
POSSIBLY BECAUSE IT'S A JOYFUL ROMP FULL OF MUSICAL JOKES 
AND SOMEHOW SEEN AS A LESSER WORK FOR THAT 
BUT FOR HECTOR BERLIOZ THIS SYMPHONY WAS WHOLLY WORTHY OF THOSE BY BEETHOVEN 
THAT PRECEDED AND FOLLOWED AND IT'S MORE REMARKABLE BECAUSE IT'S IN NO WAY LIKE THEM 
THE SYMPHONY WAS WRITTEN IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWELVE WHEN AT THE AGE OF FORTY TWO 
BEETHOVEN WAS GROWING INCREASINGLY DEAF 
BUT HE NEVERTHELESS CONDUCTED THE PREMIERE 
REPORTEDLY THE ORCHESTRA LARGELY IGNORED HIS UNGAINLY GESTURES 
AND FOLLOWED THE PRINCIPLE VIOLINIST INSTEAD 
WELL THE EIGHTH IS THE SHORTEST OF BEETHOVEN'S SYMPHONIES AT JUST TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES LONG 
IT'S IN FOUR MOVEMENTS A SALUTE TO THE SYMPHONIC IDEAL OF A PREVIOUS AGE 
IT FOLLOWS THE FORMAL OUTLINE OF THE CLASSICAL SYMPHONY 
WHICH FILLS IT WITH MUSIC THAT REVEALS THE EXPANDED EMOTIONAL POWER 
OF A TRULY ROMANTIC COMPOSER 
SO HERE IS GIANANDREA NOSEDA 
PRINCIPAL CONDUCTOR OF THE B. B. C. PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA 
TO PERFORM BEETHOVEN'S EIGHTH SYMPHONY 
WELL SCHOPENHAUER SAID THAT PIECE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE FORGET THE WORLD IS FULL OF MISERY 
BEETHOVEN'S EXPLOSIVELY DIRECT 
AND UNAPOLOGETICALLY EXUBERANT EIGHTH SYMPHONY 
PERFORMED BY THE B. B. C. PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA 
CONDUCTED BY GIANANDREA NOSEDA 
THE LEADER WAS YURI TORCHINSKY 
WHEN ASKED BY HIS PUPIL KARL CZERNY 
WHY THE EIGHTH SYMPHONY WAS LESS POPULAR THAN THE SEVENTH 
BEETHOVEN IS SAID TO HAVE REPLIED BECAUSE THE EIGHTH IS SO MUCH BETTER 
HE REFERRED TO THIS SYMPHONY AS MY LITTLE ONE 
IT'S HIS SHORTEST SYMPHONY INDEED HE DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO WRITE ANOTHER 
FOR ANOTHER TWELVE YEARS WHEN HE PRODUCED ARGUABLY HIS GREATEST WORK 
THE NINTH SYMPHONY 
IN JUST A FEW SHORT MOMENTS 
WE'LL BE HEARING THE AMERICAN SOPRANO RENEE FLEMING 
SINGING BERG'S SEVEN EARLY SONGS 
PLUS A NEW ORCHESTRATION OF ANOTHER EARLY SONG AN LEUKON 
JUST TIME TO INTRODUCE MY GUESTS FOR THIS EVENING 
THEY ARE THE COMPOSERS PHILIP SHEPPARD AND STEVE MARTLAND 
WELCOME TO YOU BOTH 
PHILIP IT'S AMAZING TO THINK THAT BERG WROTE HIS SEVEN EARLY SONGS 
WITH VIRTUALLY NO FORMAL TRAINING AT ALL 
THEY'RE AN INCREDIBLE ACHIEVEMENT AREN'T THEY 
THAT'S RIGHT THEY STARTED THEIR LIFE AS A BATCH OF ABOUT SEVENTY OR EIGHTY SONGS 
IN ABOUT NINETEEN OH SEVEN NINETEEN OH EIGHT 
AND BERG RESPONDED TO A NEWSPAPER ADVERT THAT SCHOENBERG HAD PLACED 
ADVERTISING FOR PUPILS AND BOTH HE AND WEBERN RESPONDED 
IN A WAY THAT SHAPED AN AWFUL LOT OF MUSICAL HISTORY 
WHEN HE CAME TO STUDY WITH SCHOENBERG 
SCHOENBERG REALISED THAT THIS WAS SOMEBODY WHO COULD WRITE MELODIC LINES 
BUT REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE FOR INSTRUMENTS APART FROM THE VOICE 
AFTER HIS TRAINING WITH SCHOENBERG 
HE WENT ON TO REVISE THESE SONGS TO REVISIT THEM 
THOSE HE CONSIDERED THE BEST OF THEM 
SO BY NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT HE'D THEN ORCHESTRATED THEM IN A QUITE SUMPTUOUS MANNER 
THAT WE'LL HEAR THIS EVENING 
STEVE GIVE US A SENSE OF THE SET OF SEVEN THE CONTRASTS 
THEY MOVE THROUGH A HUGE NUMBER OF MOODS AND COLOURS 
THEY DO BUT IT'S A VERY LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY ROMANTICISM AGAIN 
ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH WAGNER AND MAHLER WILL SEE ALL THE INFLUENCES 
WHAT'S VERY INTERESTING I THINK 
IS THAT BERG IS A COMPOSER WHO IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE 
THAT'S WHAT THE MUSIC IS ABOUT THE SUBJECTIVE CONTENT OF IT 
WHICH IS OF COURSE AGAIN A LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY MOVE IN MUSIC 
THESE EARLY PIECES ALREADY SHOW THAT THAT'S WHAT BERG IS GOING TO BE 
WHERE THE SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT HIMSELF IS IN THIS MUSIC 
WITH HIS 
LATER ON HE USES CODES AND NUMBERS AND NAMES AND THE LOVE AFFAIRS AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
VERY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY 
WITH STRAVINSKY AND BARTOK WHO GOT RID OF THE SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT 
THESE ARE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY THINGS 
THEY'LL BE FAMILIAR THIS STYLE TO MOST PEOPLE WHO LIKE WAGNER 
AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE'S MAHLER IN THEM 
IT'S ALMOST THE THING THAT BONDS RICHARD STRAUSS TO MAHLER IN MY OPINION 
LISTENING TO THE REHEARSAL THIS AFTERNOON 
THERE'S SO MUCH MAHLER AND STRAUSS WITHIN THEM AS WELL 
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED 
WELL HERE IS SOPRANO RENEE FLEMING 
THE CONDUCTOR GIANANDREA NOSEDA 
TO PERFORM BERG'S SEVEN EARLY SONGS AND AN LEUKON 
STUNNING PERFORMANCE THERE 
RENEE FLEMING WITH BERG'S SEVEN EARLY SONGS PLUS AN LEUKON 
WITH THE B. B. C. PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA CONDUCTED BY GIANANDREA NOSEDA 
WELL THE REACTION OF ONE VIEWER SAYS IT ALL 
STEVE JEFFREY IN WORTHING HAS TEXTED US TO SAY 
SURELY I'VE DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN 
THANK YOU RENEE ORCHESTRA AND BERG MAGNIFICENT 
RENEE FLEMING TOLD US EARLIER ABOUT HER STUNNING CHRISTIAN DIOR DRESS 
WHICH SHE HAD SPECIALLY MADE IN PARIS 
JOHN GALLIANO DESIGNED IT HIMSELF FOR TONIGHT'S CONCERT 
AND WEARING THE DRESS IS APPARENTLY NO MEAN FEAT 
VERY HARD TO SIT DOWN IN 
IT WEIGHS SIX KILOS AND EACH SEQUIN IS PAINTED BY HAND 
WELL WE'VE GOT AN INTERVAL NOW OF ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES 
BEFORE RENEE FLEMING RETURNS TO SING TWO ARIAS BY KORNGOLD 
WE'LL THEN ALSO HEAR SCHUMANN'S SECOND SYMPHONY 
IN JUST FEW MOMENTS WE'LL BE TALKING TO RENEE FLEMING 
I'LL ALSO BE MEETING EDWARD GARDNER THE NEW MUSIC DIRECTOR OF THE ENGLISH NATIONAL OPERA 
MY GUESTS PHILIP AND STEVE ARE STILL WITH ME 
PHILIP SHE REALLY CAN SING 
SHE REALLY CAN STUNNING 
I'VE GOT GOOSEBUMPS FROM HEAD TO TOE 
IT'S SO WONDERFUL TO HEAR THOSE SUNG IN THAT WAY 
SHE'S CAN SING PHENOMENALLY IN TUNE HER CONTROL'S AMAZING 
THE ORCHESTRATION IN THOSE PIECES IS TEXTBOOK 
IT'S BEYOND THE TEXTBOOK HE'S THROWN IT AWAY BY THIS POINT 
SHE CAN CARRY IT SO BEAUTIFULLY 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY IT WAS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
EVERY SINGLE MOVEMENT OF THAT SEEMS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT COLOUR 
A DIFFERENT ANGLE TO IT 
IT WAS QUITE FUNNY HEARING THE NEW ARRANGEMENT IN THE MIDDLE 
DID THAT WORK FOR YOU 
IN PARTS 
A NEW ARRANGEMENT BY CHRISTOPHER GORDON A U. K. PREMIERE TONIGHT 
STEVE THEY ARE VERY MUCH SINGERS' SONGS AREN'T THEY 
THEY GIVE THE SINGER A HUGE AMOUNT OF EXPRESSIVE POSSIBILITY 
I THINK THAT'S TRUE 
THE SINGER HAS THIS VERY THICK ORCHESTRATION TO BATTLE AGAINST 
IN ITS WAGNERIAN SENSE 
ALTHOUGH THE SKILL OF BERG 
THEY ARE ORCHESTRATIONS DONE LATER IN LIFE AREN'T THEY 
OF VERY EARLY SONGS 
WHEN YOU HEAR THE SEQUENCE THE FIRST ONE IS VERY CHROMATIC 
AND THEN THERE'S MANY CONTRASTS OF THE SIMPLICITY OF THE TONALITY OF SOME OF THEM 
TO THE MORE CHROMATIC THINGS 
WHICH SORT OF IT'S JUST A SEQUENCE OF SONGS REALLY 
THERE'S NO CYCLE CONNECT TO IT IN THAT SENSE 
IN THAT SENSE ALSO IT IS OBVIOUSLY A VEHICLE FOR SINGERS 
IT GIVES THEM PLENTY TO DO 
ALSO IN A WAY IT'S A SET OF VIGNETTES 
IT'S LIKE AN ALBUM OF PIECES THAT ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER 
AND THE BREVITY IS ALSO AN ADVANTAGE 
WHERE MAHLER WOULD TAKE SEVEN OR EIGHT MINUTES TO GET TO THAT MOMENT OF ECSTASY 
YOU'RE THERE WITHIN ABOUT FIVE SECONDS IN SOME CASES 
HE'S VERY CLEVER WITH THE ORCHESTRATION 
BY THE SECOND SONG HE'S STRIPPED AWAY THE STRINGS AND LEFT YOU WITH SOLO STRINGS 
BY THE SONG IN THE ROOM HE'S TAKEN THE STRINGS OUT ALTOGETHER 
WHICH IS I THINK WHY THE NEW ARRANGEMENT WENT FOR STRINGS ONLY 
THERE IS A LOT OF CLEVER COLOUR SHIFTING THAT GOES ON WITHIN IT 
FOR ME THAT'S WHY IT WORKS FROM AN ORCHESTRATION POINT OF VIEW 
THERE'S SO MUCH CLEVER SWAPPING AROUND WITHIN IT AS A SMALL CYCLE 
WE TALKED ABOUT THE SONGS BEING ON THE CUSP OF THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURIES 
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY INFLUENCES OF SCHUMANN WOLF DEBUSSY 
BUT ALSO THERE'S THIS EXPLOSION OF SCHOENBERG INTO HIS LIFE 
AND YOU CAN HEAR ALL OF THOSE THINGS GOING ON IN THESE SONGS CAN'T YOU 
YES THERE'S NO REAL VERNACULAR IN THESE THINGS 
ALTHOUGH YOU DO GET A SENSE OFTEN OF THREE IN A BAR 
THE VIENNESE ELEMENT THERE'S QUITE A STRONG ELEMENT OF THAT 
FROM THE HARMONIC POINT OF VIEW AS WELL 
BERG IS A SERIOUSLY HARMONIC COMPOSER IN THAT SENSE 
EVEN IN HIS TWELVE NOTE WORKS THERE'S STRONG TONALITY 
THERE'S ALSO THIS VIENNESE ELEMENT IN THE ORCHESTRATIONS OF SO MANY OCTAVES IN THE VIOLINS 
THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THAT REALLY 
WHAT HE'S ALSO TAKEN FROM SCHOENBERG IS WHEN SCHOENBERG SETS POETRY 
HE SEEMS TO LOT FREER THAN WHEN HE'S WRITING PURELY INSTRUMENTALLY 
IN PIECES LIKE VERKLARTE NACHT WHERE HE'S SETTING A POEM AS A TONE POEM 
EVEN IN THE SECOND STRING QUARTET 
WHERE YOU HAVE A SOPRANO SINGING IN THE LAST MOVEMENT 
YOU'VE GOT THAT LOVELY LINE OF FEELING A WIND FROM ANOTHER PLANET 
THERE'S A LOT OF THAT GOING ON HERE 
THAT'S WHERE HE'S COMING FROM THE LYRICAL SIDE OF SCHOENBERG 
WHEREAS WEBERN WAS PROBABLY GOING FOR THE HARDCORE SHORT TECHNICAL ASPECTS 
OF BEING MORE PROVOCATIVE 
HE IN A WAY IS WRAPPING UP THE VIENNESE CENTURY I THINK 
AGAIN STRADDLING THE ANACHRONISTIC VIENNA AND THE MORE PROGRESSIVE MODERNIST VIENNA 
HE'S A HIGHLY HIGHLY ROMANTIC COMPOSER 
OH GOSH YEAH 
I MEAN THE RUBATO THAT'S WRITTEN ALL OVER THE SCORE 
IT IS LIKE A SUPER ROMANTIC 
WHICH OF COURSE FOR MANY PEOPLE IT'S SIMPLY TOO MUCH LIKE ME 
IT'S LOVELY TO TALK TO YOU BOTH I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER 
LET'S JOIN BO VAN DER MEULEN 
THANK YOU SUZY I'M BACKSTAGE WHERE WE'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH 
TO STEAL A FEW MOMENTS WITH RENEE FLEMING 
THANK YOU SO MUCH RENEE FOR JOINING US 
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN BO 
YOU'RE NOT A STRANGER TO THE PROMS YOU'VE BEEN HERE MANY TIMES 
WHEN YOU PLAN YOUR SEASONS HOW IMPORTANT IS A DATE IN THE PROMS 
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY THERE'S NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT IN THE WORLD 
I KEEP RANTING AND RAVING THAT WE NEED THIS IN NEW YORK 
THERE'S SOMETHING SO AMAZING ABOUT SEEING ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE STANDING 
MOSTLY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CAN COME AND COME OFTEN AND QUEUE UP ALL DAY 
I JUST THINK IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST CLASSICAL MUSIC GENRES 
FOR THE ATTENDANCE OF THE AUDIENCE ANYWHERE 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO YOUR GREAT COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND PLACIDO DOMINGO 
CAME AND MADE HIS DEBUT HERE AT THE PROMS 
HE SAID HE WAS TERRIFIED OF GOING OUT THERE STANDING THIS CLOSE TO THE AUDIENCE 
HOW IS THAT FOR YOU 
HONESTLY I'M MORE NERVOUS WITH THESE CONCERTS THAN JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE 
BECAUSE OF THE CLOSENESS PROXIMITY THE ATTENTIVENESS OF EVERYONE 
WE'RE USED TO PEOPLE PAYING A LOT OF MONEY SITTING IN THEIR SEATS 
AND YOU CAN PICK UP FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE WHO ARE ASLEEP 
IT'S NOT THE SAME EVERYONE HERE WANTS TO BE HERE 
THEY'RE HANGING ON EVERY NOTE 
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE AND IT MAKES ME THINK 
OH MY GOODNESS I HAVE TO BE TWICE AS GOOD AS USUAL TONIGHT 
I HAVE TO BE SOMETHING SPECIAL 
IT'S ENORMOUS PRESSURE 
IN THESE EIGHT EARLY SONGS BY BERG THAT YOU SANG 
YOU GOT THEM SO QUIET AND CONCENTRATED 
THAT'S ALSO PART OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY NIGHT I SPENT HERE WAS SINGING THE FOUR LAST SONGS OF VIER LETZTE LIEDER BY STRAUSS 
IT'S A SONG CYCLE WHICH IS TWENTY MINUTES LONG AND NOBODY MOVED 
I THINK I CAN'T STAND STILL FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME 
IT'S THE SAME WITH THIS SONG CYCLE 
IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY EASY IT'S NOT ROUSING 
IT'S VERY MUCH AN INTERIOR INTIMATE PIECE OF MUSIC 
AND PEOPLE WERE EXTREMELY ATTENTIVE 
THAT WAS IN GERMAN OF COURSE 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SING TWO BIG KORNGOLD ARIAS IN GERMAN 
YOU'RE FLUENT IN MANY LANGUAGES BUT HOW DO YOU APPROACH THESE SONGS 
DO YOU APPROACH THEM VIA THE TEXT AND THEN TO THE MUSIC OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND 
I DO BOTH TOGETHER GENERALLY SPEAKING 
I DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF TIME 
AND IF I HAD A LOT OF TIME I WOULD PROBABLY BEGIN WITH THE POETRY 
BECAUSE THE MORE FAMILIAR ONE IS WITH THE TEXT 
THE EASIER IT IS LATER ON TO HAVE IT ALL HANG TOGETHER 
AND KEEP THAT SENSE OF EXPRESSIVENESS AT THE FOREFRONT 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS COMMUNICATING 
AND THE TEXT IS COMMUNICATED THROUGH THE MUSIC 
SO THEY REALLY DO GO TOGETHER FOR ME 
THEN YOU GO TO THESE BIG OPERA ARIAS BY KORNGOLD 
VERY DIFFERENT WOMEN DIE KATHRIN AND DAS WUNDER DER HELIANE 
OH YES 
ONE VERY DOWN TO EARTH I WOULD SAY IN A NORMAL LIFE 
THE SECOND ONE COMPLETELY ETHERICAL IN A MYTHICAL WORLD ALMOST 
EXACTLY THE SECOND ONE HE WROTE OF COURSE MUCH EARLIER 
AND THE MIRACLE OF HELEN IS THE MOST FANTASMICAL 
IN A SENSE FUTURISTIC STORY BECAUSE IT TAKES PLACE IN NO MANS LAND 
AND SHE IS ON TRIAL FOR INFIDELITY 
SHE SAYS YOU KNOW I PRAYED TO GOD TO MAKE ME GO THROUGH WITH IT 
YOU KNOW TO HELP THIS STRANGER 
AND IN THE END SHE SAYS BUT THE BOY WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL 
AND THE MINUTE SHE SAYS IT YOU HEAR THAT SHE LOVES HIM 
THE MUSIC GIVES IT AWAY 
IT'S ALSO TRICKY SHE WAS CAUGHT COMPLETELY NAKED IN HIS PRESENCE 
THAT'S WHY WE LOVE OPERA 
YOU GET AWAY WITH THAT IN OPERA 
WE GOT A LOVELY E. MAIL HERE FROM PETER GODDARD 
HE SAYS THAT THIS IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE YEAR'S PROM FOR HIM 
WOW THANK YOU 
ARE THERE ANY OTHER CONDUCTORS BESIDES VALERY GERGIEV WHO MAGICALLY INSPIRE YOU 
MANY IF I DIDN'T HAVE MUSICAL COLLABORATORS 
SUCH AS VALERY CHRISTOPH ESCHENBACH AND JAMES LEVINE 
THERE'S SO MANY FANTASTIC CONDUCTORS WHO I WORK WITH WHO I ADORE 
TONIGHT GIANANDREA NOSEDA THIS IS OUR FIRST TIME TOGETHER 
IT'S BEEN A REAL JOY 
IT FELT LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS TOGETHER 
YOU WERE SO CLOSE SO INTIMATE IT FELT LIKE YOU HAD A LONG COLLABORATION 
HE'S VERY WARM VERY GIVING INCREDIBLY WELL PREPARED 
THIS IS THE GREAT JOY OF FOR ME IN EVERYTHING I DO 
IS THE SENSE OF COLLABORATION WITH ANOTHER MUSICIAN 
YOU SAY IN EVERYTHING I DO AND THAT IS AN AWFUL LOT IN YOUR CASE 
YOU GO FROM MUSICAL THEATRE OPERA OPERETTA TO EVEN JAZZ AND POP 
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR JAZZ LEGACY 
WELL I STARTED AS A JAZZ SINGER WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE 
THAT'S WHAT I HAD THE MOST SUCCESS AT BY FAR 
EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BECOME A JAZZ SINGER 
THEY WERE SHOCKED WHEN I JUMPED OVER AND STUCK WITH CLASSICAL MUSIC 
I REALLY STILL LOVE IT I'M A HUGE FAN I LISTEN AVIDLY 
I GO TO CLUBS WHEN I CAN 
AND IT WAS REALLY WONDERFUL TO GO BACK TO MY BEGINNINGS 
AND MAKE THE DISC OF JAZZ SO I LOVED THAT 
A LITTLE THING ABOUT YOUR PARENTS 
BOTH YOUR PARENTS WERE MUSIC TEACHERS 
AND I READ IN YOUR BOOK THAT MUSIC WAS THE AIR IT WASN'T IN THE AIR IT WAS YOUR AIR 
WAS THERE ANY OTHER PROFESSION YOU COULD HAVE CHOSEN 
I WANTED TO DO ANYTHING BUT SING ANYTHING BUT MUSIC 
I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO THE SAME 
WE ALL ENDED UP DOING THE SAME THING MY SISTER 
MY PARENTS ARE BOTH HIGH SCHOOL VOCAL MUSIC TEACHERS 
I HAVE ONE DAUGHTER WHO'S NOW PROCLAIMED SHE WANTS TO BE A SINGER 
I'M IN A GOOD POSITION TO HELP HER I THINK 
BUT I WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS I REALLY WANTED TO BE THE PRESIDENT 
I WAS VERY AMBITIOUS I ALWAYS HAD THAT 
YOU NEVER KNOW IT'S NEVER TOO LATE 
WE NEED THAT FOR WHAT WE DO YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY RESILIENT TO STICK THIS OUT IT'S NOT EASY 
ABSOLUTELY THANKS SO MUCH AND ENJOY THE KORNGOLD 
THANK YOU THANKS IT'S A JOY 
I'M DELIGHTED NOW TO BE JOINED BY ONE OF LONDON'S MOST TALKED ABOUT MUSICAL FIGURES OF THE LAST YEAR 
THE NEW MUSIC DIRECTOR AT THE ENO EDWARD GARDNER THANKS FOR JOINING US 
DID YOU ENJOY THAT PERFORMANCE OF THE SEVEN EARLY SONGS 
VERY MUCH IT'S A PIECE I FELL IN LOVE WITH ABOUT A DECADE AGO 
WHEN I HEARD A CONCERT PERFORMANCE WITH CHRISTINE BREWER 
I LOVE THEIR SENSUALITY 
AND I THOUGHT RENEE FLEMING BROUGHT IT OUT AMAZINGLY 
NOW I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE GOING TO BE MAKING YOUR OWN PROMS DEBUT SOON 
WE'RE DOING A WONDERFUL BRITTEN PROGRAMME ACTUALLY 
IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO SEE THE DIVERSITY OF KORNGOLD'S MUSIC 
WITH THESE TWO OPERATIC EXCERPTS AND WE KNOW MORE MAYBE ABOUT HIS FILM SCORES 
WITH BRITTEN WE'RE GONNA HEAR IN THAT PROGRAMME 
TWO OF THE PIECES HE WROTE FOR THE POST OFFICE IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
ONE A LITTLE MORE SERIOUS TO A AUDEN TEXT THE NIGHT MAIL 
THEN ONE WHICH I THINK IS WINKING AT US A BIT IN RETROSPECT 
THE WAY TO THE SEA 
ABOUT THE ELECTRIFICATION OF THE PORTSMOUTH RAILWAY LINE 
COUPLED WITH THAT WE'VE GOT A FEW OTHER GEMS OF BRITTEN 
THE SERENADE SUNG BY ANDREW KENNEDY 
AND CHRISTINE RICE SINGING THE CABARET SONGS 
SO IT SHOULD BE A WONDERFUL CONCERT FULL OF CONTRASTS 
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE DEATH IN VENICE SO YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY A BIG FAN 
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF TURN OF THE SCREW AT GLYNDEBOURNE SO IT'S A BIG SEASON OF BRITTEN 
YOU'VE ALSO GOT A BIG SEASON COMING UP IN THE AUTUMN 
I KNOW YOU'RE DOING A BIG CARMEN WHAT ARE YOU HOPING TO DO WITH THAT 
IT'S GREAT TO GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO A NEW PRODUCTION OF CARMEN 
REVIVALS COME ALONG THE WHOLE TIME 
TO WORK ON A NEW PRODUCTION 
AND HAVE TIME TO LOOK AT IT AFRESH WITH THE ORCHESTRA 
IS A HUGE THING FOR ME 
I BELIEVE IN THE SCORE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT OPERATIC MASTERPIECES 
I'M GOING TO BE WORKING ALONGSIDE SALLY POTTER THE EXTRAORDINARY FILM DIRECTOR 
WHO MADE ORLANDO 
YES AND THE TANGO LESSON 
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT ALREADY ON THE NEW TRANSLATION WE'VE COMMISSIONED 
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET STARTED WITH REHEARSALS 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT WORKING WITH ARTISTS LIKE SALLY POTTER 
THAT YOU'RE HOPING TO ACHIEVE THAT YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE MORE AT ENO 
I THINK ENO IS KNOWN FOR ITS DIVERSITY OF PRODUCTIONS 
THAT'S SOMETHING WE REALLY WANT TO MAINTAIN OVER FORTHCOMING SEASONS 
SALLY POTTER HAS A DIRECTNESS OF VISION ABOUT WHAT SHE WANTS TO GET 
HOW SHE WANTS A STORY TO BE TOLD WHICH I ENGAGE WITH ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
THAT FOR ME IS THE BIG THING FOR CARMEN 
WALKING INTO THE JOB AT THE ENO IS NOT AN EASY FEAT 
THEY'VE NOT HAD THE SMOOTHEST TIME OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
THE GUARDIAN SAID YOU MUST HAVE TO HAVE BALLS OF STEEL TO DO THE JOB 
DID YOU FEEL DAUNTED BY IT OR IS IT JUST A FANTASTIC CHALLENGE 
I'VE BEEN ASKED THAT QUITE A LOT 
I FEEL PRESSURE WHENEVER I CONDUCT ANYWHERE OR ANYTHING 
SO IN A SENSE THE PRESSURE'S NO DIFFERENT 
THE THING THAT I FOUND DIFFICULT ABOUT THE JOB SO FAR 
IS TO DIVIDE THE TWO SIDES OF MY PERSONALITY 
THE CONDUCTOR THE MUSICIAN THE COLLABORATOR ON ONE SIDE 
AWAY FROM THE MANAGER WHO HAS TO DEAL WITH THE POLITICAL 
MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE TURNING UP TO YOUR PRODUCTIONS 
EXACTLY DIVIDING THOSE TWO AND COMBINING THOSE TWO IS FOR ME THE KEY TO THE JOB 
IF I GET THAT RIGHT I HAVE A CHANCE OF HAVING SUCCESS WITH THE JOB 
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT CARMEN MORE BROADLY SPEAKING WHAT DO YOU FEEL YOU'D REALLY LIKE TO ACHIEVE 
THAT YOU PARTICULARLY CAN BRING TO THE JOB 
I THINK THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH OPERA WHEN I SAW A PRODUCTION 
THAT COMBINED INCREDIBLE THEATRE WITH INCREDIBLE MUSIC MAKING 
YOU COULDN'T REALLY TELL WHAT WAS DOING WHAT 
IT WAS JUST ONE THING 
THAT'S ALL I AIM FOR IN ANY KIND OF PRODUCTION THAT I DO 
WHETHER IT BE A ROSENKAVALIER AT THE END OF THE SEASON 
OR PUNCH AND JUDY BY BIRTWISTLE IN A MUCH SMALLER SPACE 
THAT'S ALL I WOULD EVER AIM FOR 
WHAT WAS THAT FIRST PASSIONATE OPERA MEMORY FOR YOU 
DO YOU REMEMBER THINKING THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO 
ABSOLUTELY IT WAS ALSO AT ENO WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN AND IT WAS THEIR ICONIC LADY MACBETH 
DAVID POUNTNEY PRODUCTION WHICH IS STILL SEARED ON MY MEMORY 
DO YOU REMEMBER THE MOMENT WHERE YOU SUDDENLY HAD THAT DAGGER IN THE HEART AND THOUGHT THAT'S IT 
YES I THINK UP TO THAT POINT ONE HADN'T HEARD MUCH OPERA 
I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT OPERA COULD COME OUT OF PEOPLE'S GUTS LIKE THAT 
IT FELT TO ME VERY ETHEREAL OR SOMEHOW AIRY 
BUT THAT EVENING MADE ME SEE THAT OPERA REALLY CAN COME RIGHT OUT OF PEOPLE'S SOULS 
THERE ARE A LOT OF VERY EXCITING YOUNG DYNAMIC CONDUCTORS 
WHO SEEM TO BE PUTTING THEIR STAMP ON A NEW KIND OF CONDUCTING 
WHAT THE POST CAN BE 
WHAT IS IT YOU FEEL THAT IT CAN BE AND YOU CAN BRING TO IT 
BECAUSE GONE ARE THE DAYS OF THOSE BIG FOOT STAMPING MAESTROS I THINK 
IT'S TRUE LUCKILY I'VE STARTED IN AN ERA WHERE IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO BE A FOOT STAMPING MAESTRO 
ORCHESTRAS AREN'T REALLY OUT TO TEST THEY'RE OUT TO BE AS GOOD AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN 
THE SAME WITH THE CHORUSES AT ENO FOR EXAMPLE 
I'M INTERESTED IN COLLABORATION I TRY AND PERSUADE PEOPLE MUCH MORE THAN BEING AUTOCRATIC 
SO I JUST AIM FOR THE HIGHEST RESULTS I CAN 
I CAN'T SAY IN WHAT WAY I'M DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER ERA 
BUT THAT'S WHAT I AIM FOR 
IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME TO JUSTIFY THE EXISTENCE OF ANY ARTS COMPANY 
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET FUNDING IT'S VERY HARD TO KEEP PLACES OPEN 
WHY IS IT THAT YOU THINK THAT THE ENO IS INDISPENSABLE TO LONDON'S MUSICAL LIFE 
I THINK THE RANGE OF PRODUCTIONS WE DO AND THE WAY WE ARE INCREDIBLY PRODUCTION INTENSIVE 
OUR LONG REHEARSAL PERIODS OUR INTERESTING COLLABORATIONS WITH FILM AND THEATRE DIRECTORS 
GIVING PEOPLE THEIR FIRST OPERAS 
SATYAGRAHA RECENTLY HAD A SEVENTY EIGHT PER CENT NEWCOMERS TO OPERA ATTENDANCE 
WHICH IS REMARKABLE 
WE HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT AUDIENCE FROM ANY OTHER OPERA IN LONDON 
I THINK IT'S OUR RANGE AND THE RISKS WE TAKE WITH OUR PRODUCTION VALUES 
AND OUR COMMITMENT TO BACKING IT UP WITH MUSICAL STANDARDS WHICH I HOPE WILL ALWAYS SET US APART 
THERE HAVE BEEN THE CONTROVERSIAL SURTITLES AT THE ENO 
DO WE NEED TO HAVE A TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH WHEN EVERYBODY'S ALREADY SINGING IN ENGLISH 
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT IT 
THERE'S NO ISSUE ABOUT BEING PASSIONATE ABOUT IT 
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND ALL SIDES OF THE STORY 
JENUFA RECENTLY WAS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A PIECE 
WHICH WHETHER WE HAD SURTITLES TO AID THE UNDERSTANDING OF EVERY SINGLE WORD OR NOT 
PEOPLE WERE SINGING AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN A SINGER'S VOICE 
IN THE AUDITORIUM WAS REMARKABLE 
THE CONNECTION AMONGST THE SINGERS THE CHORUS AND THE PRINCIPLES 
AFTERWARDS THE INTENSITY WAS PALPABLE 
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH WILL NEVER BE COMPROMISED BY SURTITLES 
THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING ABOUT THE ARGUMENT 
IS THAT IT'S ALWAYS DISCUSSED AMONGST PEOPLE WHO SIT IN ROW A OF THE DRESS CIRCLE 
I SAW MY FIRST OPERA FROM ROW Z. OF THE BALCONY 
I KNOW HOW HARD IT CAN BE TO UNDERSTAND 
WE LIVE IN AN AGE WHERE PEOPLE WANT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF EVERYTHING 
I THINK FOR NOW THEY ARE NECESSARY 
I DON'T THINK IT CONTRADICTS WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH TRANSLATION AT ALL 
WE'VE SEEN IN THE RECENT PAST OPERA COME TO GLASTONBURY MUSIC FESTIVAL 
WE'VE SEEN IT COME TO TRAFALGAR SQUARE 
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF PLACES WHERE OPERA IS STARTING TO INFILTRATE 
IS THAT A GOOD THING IN YOUR BOOK AND WOULD YOU LIKE BE PART OF THAT 
WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS OF DOING THAT FOR NEXT SEASON 
FIRST OF ALL WE'RE GOING TO THE YOUNG VIC 
TO DO A COUPLE OF SMALLER SCALE PRODUCTIONS 
GLOBALLY OPERA AUDIENCES AND COMPANIES WANT A STUDIO SPACE 
WHERE THEY CAN SHOW THINGS ON A SMALLER SCALE WORKSHOP AND EXPERIMENT A BIT MORE 
OTHER VENUES ARE VERY INTERESTING TO US 
ANTHONY MINGHELLA IS LOOKING AT A PLACE 
AN ARENA THAT HE CAN DO THE MATTHEW PASSION IN NEXT SEASON 
HE'S VERY AGAINST DOING ANYTHING IN A PROSCENIUM ARCH THEATRE 
HE WANTS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT OUTLOOK ON THE PIECE AND WHAT THEATRE MIGHT BE 
SO YEAH WE'RE VERY OPEN 
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TALKING TO YOU ED ENJOY THE SECOND HALF 
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME 
LET'S GO BACK DOWNSTAIRS TO BO VAN DER MEULEN 
THANK YOU SUZY 
IN THE SECOND HALF OF TONIGHT'S CONCERT 
RENEE FLEMING WILL PERFORM TWO ARIAS BY ERICH KORNGOLD 
A FITTING TRIBUTE TO MARK THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH 
IN HIS LIFETIME HE COMPOSED OPERAS CHAMBER MUSIC AND ORCHESTRAL WORKS 
BUT HE'S PERHAPS BETTER KNOWN FOR HIS GLORIOUS FILM SCORES 
KORNGOLD HIMSELF HOWEVER MADE NO DISTINCTION 
OF HIS WORK HE SAID 
HIS FILM MUSIC WAS GROUNDBREAKING WITH ITS MASSIVE ORCHESTRAL SOUND 
BUT WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO HOLLYWOOD HE SAID 
HE HAD A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH FRIEND AND RIVAL AT WARNER BROTHERS 
COMPOSER MAX STEINER 
KORNGOLD'S SON ERNST REMEMBERS STEINER TELLING HIS FATHER 
HE REPLIED 
SO A MAN OF GREAT MUSICAL TALENT 
AND WE'LL HEAR MORE OF HIS MUSIC COURTESY OF RENEE FLEMING 
BACK TO YOU SUZY 
THANKS BO IN JUST A FEW MINUTES WE'LL BEGIN THE SECOND PART OF TONIGHT'S PROM 
WE'LL HEAR RENEE FLEMING SINGING TWO ARIAS BY KORNGOLD AND THEN SCHUMANN'S SECOND SYMPHONY 
PHILIP SHEPPARD AND STEVE MARTLAND ARE STILL WITH ME 
PHIL KORNGOLD CALLED HIS ORCHESTRAL WORK OPERA WITHOUT THE SINGING 
IS IT ALL VOCAL MELODIC MUSIC DO YOU THINK 
I THINK THAT'S TRUE 
FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORKS RIGHT THROUGH TO THE VERY LAST PIECE 
PEOPLE MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE VIOLIN CONCERTO THAT HE WROTE FOR HEIFETZ 
WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET BACK TO THE CONCERT STAGE AFTER THE FILM WORK 
THAT IS BASICALLY SOARING OPERATIC LINES FOR SURE 
WHERE HE ISN'T SO OPERATIC IS IN HIS PIANO MUSIC 
AND ALSO IN HIS STRING SERENADE 
I THINK IT'S A BIT OF A BROAD THING TO SAY 
I DON'T THINK IT'S TRUE TOTALLY ACROSS THE BOARD 
OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE'RE HEARING TONIGHT IS 
BUT NOT ACROSS THE WHOLE OF HIS CANON NO 
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THESE TWO ARIAS FROM TWO DIFFERENT OPERAS 
JUST GIVE US A SENSE OF THEIR CHARACTER AND FLAVOUR 
AGAIN OVER THE TOP ROMANTICISM IF YOU LIKE 
KORNGOLD WAS A SUPER ROMANTIC BUT HE WAS NOT A MODERNIST 
THE WAY THAT BERG WAS MOVING INTO THE NEW DIRECTIONS OF SCHOENBERG 
IT'S THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT'S STRAUSSIAN 
LUXURIOUS ORCHESTRAL COLOUR 
HE WAS A SENSATIONALLY SPECTACULAR VIRTUOSO OF USING THE ORCHESTRA 
THE WAY LISZT USED THE PIANO 
IT WAS HIS INSTRUMENT 
OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT WHEN HE LATER WENT TO HOLLYWOOD 
AND WROTE THESE VERY FAMOUS FILM SCORES 
THEY ARE THESE SYMPHONIC FILM SCORES WITH SPECTACULAR ORCHESTRATION 
MORE SO THAT STRAUSS REALLY THE USE OF COLOUR 
THE VIRTUOSITY OF THE WHOLE THING 
WHAT HE'S WRITING DOES NOT FIT EMOTIONALLY WHAT THE TEXT IS SAYING 
IN THE FIRST PIECE DIE KATHRIN 
SHE SINGS I'M NEVER GOING TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
SHE'S COMPOSING A LETTER TO A SOLDIER SHE'S MET AT THE CINEMA 
IT'S A MODERN OPERA 
I CAN'T I LOVE YOU I WILL ALWAYS BE KISSING YOU 
BUT ALL THE TIME THE MUSIC IS THE MOST OPTIMISTIC FABULOUSLY WARM RICH 
SHE'S SAYING I'LL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN 
I'LL CRY IN MY SLEEP THERE'S A LITTLE TONE POEM INSERTED 
THEN IT LIFTS AND LIFTS AND SHE SAYS I'LL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN 
AND IT FINISHES 
YOU THINK THAT'S SO WEIRD THAT'S NOT CINEMATIC 
THAT'S HIM BEING AS APPOSITE AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY GO 
IT'S QUITE EXTRAORDINARY 
THEN THERE'S THE ARIA FROM DAS WUNDER DER HELIANE 
VERY DIFFERENT STYLE MUCH MORE EXPRESSIONISTIC PIECE WRITTEN EARLIER 
AN INCREDIBLE PLOT DEVICE 
BASICALLY SHE'S ON TRIAL BY SIX BLIND JUDGES 
WHO ARE TRYING HER FOR THE FACT THAT SHE HAS SLEPT WITH A STRANGER 
THE STRANGER IS A FIGURE REPRESENTATIVE OF GOODNESS COMING INTO THE LAND 
THE THING IS SHE'S GIVEN HERSELF TO HIM IN ORDER TO MAKE THE WHOLE COUNTRY A BETTER PLACE 
THE ARIA IS EXTREMELY GRAPHIC 
WHAT SHE'S SINGING ABOUT LEAVES YOU IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON 
AT EVERY STAGE OF HER DESCRIBING WHAT SHE'S TAKEN OFF AND WHAT SHE'S DONE 
THE MUSIC GIVES YOU A NOD AND A REFERENCE FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE 
SO IN A WAY THAT'S FAIRLY CINEMATIC 
STEVE KORNGOLD WAS AN AMAZING MAN AND AN AMAZING LIFE 
HE WAS AN INCREDIBLE PRODIGY 
HE WAS ANNOUNCED A GENIUS BY MAHLER WHEN HE WAS JUST NINE 
HE WROTE HIS FIRST BALLET AGED THIRTEEN WHICH WAS PERFORMED BY HENRY WOOD AT THE PROMS 
THEN HE WROTE HIS FIRST OPERA AT SIXTEEN 
JUST A STARTLING TALENT 
YEAH KORNGOLD IS NOT SO WELL KNOWN 
IN THE PAST TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS HE'S BECOME BETTER KNOWN THROUGH RECORDINGS 
BUT IN FACT YOU'RE RIGHT HE WAS PERHAPS THE NEXT PRODIGY AFTER MOZART 
ALSO WITH THIS BIZARRE RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER 
THE WAY MOZART DID 
BUT JULIUS KORNGOLD KORNGOLD'S FATHER 
WAS FAR FAR MORE EXTREME THAN MOZART'S FATHER 
IN THE SENSE THAT HE MOUNTED CAMPAIGNS ACTIVELY AGAINST OTHER COMPOSERS 
HE VIRULENTLY ATTACKED ANYBODY HE THOUGHT COULD COMPROMISE KORNGOLD'S REPUTATION 
THAT COULD DIMINISH OR GET IN THE WAY OF IT 
YOU COULDN'T MAKE THE STORY UP 
IT COULD BE THE PLOT OF AN OPERA IT'S SO IMPROBABLE AND INSANE 
AND THIS GIGANTIC OPERA THAT HE WROTE WHICH ULTIMATELY WASN'T PERFORMED AGAIN 
IT SORT OF ALMOST RUINED HIM 
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED 
SO RENEE FLEMING IS COMING ON STAGE WITH CONDUCTOR GIANANDREA NOSEDA 
TO PERFORM TWO ARIAS BY KORNGOLD 
I WENT TO HIM FROM DAS WUNDER DER HELIANE 
AND FIRST I MUST NEVER EVER SEE HIM AGAIN FROM DIE KATHRIN 
THE LUSCIOUS RICHNESS OF THE MUSIC OF ERICH KORNGOLD 
BEAUTIFULLY SUNG BY RENEE FLEMING 
IN TWO ARIAS I WENT TO HIM FROM DAS WUNDER DER HELIANE 
AND I SHALL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN FROM KORNGOLD'S OPERA DIE KATHRIN 
ACCOMPANIED BY THE B. B. C. PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA 
CONDUCTED BY GIANANDREA NOSEDA 
RENEE FLEMING'S VOICE HAS WON HER MANY AWARDS AND ACCOLADES 
MOST DELICIOUS OF WHICH HAS TO BE HAVING A DESSERT NAMED AFTER HER 
MASTER CHEF DANIEL BOULOD'S DESSERT LA DIVA RENEE 
WHICH HE CREATED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE 
SHE ALSO SERVED AS THE INSPIRATION FOR THE MAIN CHARACTER 
IN NOVELIST A. N. N. PATCHETT'S BEST SELLING BOOK BEL CANTO 
THEY WON'T LET HER GO A HUGE REACTION AS YOU CAN HEAR 
HERE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL THIS EVENING FOR THE AMERICAN SOPRANO 
RENEE FLEMING 
SHORT BREAK NOW BEFORE WE HEAR SCHUMANN'S SECOND SYMPHONY 
AND PHILIP SHEPPARD AND STEVE MARTLAND ARE STILL WITH ME 
KORNGOLD WAS OFTEN ACCUSED OF BEING MORE KORN THAN GOLD 
THE REACTION HERE TONIGHT ABSOLUTELY DEFEATS THAT 
I DON'T CARE I LOVE IT 
I THINK IT'S OUTRAGEOUS THAT THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO SEE IN AN OPERA HOUSE 
MAYBE WE SHOULD START A CAMPAIGN 
PARTICULARLY THE HELIANE THAT SECOND ARIA 
I THINK THAT HAS TO BE STAGED YOU HAVE TO SEE THAT IN CONTEXT 
THE WHOLE OPERA WOULD BE AMAZING STUNNING MUSIC 
FOR ME IT'S RAVISHING I'VE A FEELING YOU'LL DISAGREE WITH ME 
STEVE 
IT'S INTERESTING LISTENING TO IT BECAUSE IT'S VERY RICHARD STRAUSS 
BUT MUCH MORE SUGARY IN FACT IT'S A SUGARED VERSION OF IT 
IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH THE VIOLINS WHICH 
OBVIOUSLY AT THE TIME AND BERG DOES THIS AS WELL 
WITH TREMOLO 
IT'S VERY STRANGE WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY A VIENNESE EFFECT 
I'VE NEVER NOTICED BEFORE AND BERG DOES THAT IN HIS ORCHESTRATIONS 
WHICH DOES GIVE THIS VERY SUGARY SCHMALTZY 
ALSO WITH THE USE OF THE CELESTE AS WELL 
VERY LOUD ONE YEAH 
THOSE BECAME TAKEN ON BY OTHER COMPOSERS 
AS LITTLE CLICHES THAT HOLLYWOOD THEN TOOK UP 
PEOPLE SAY HOLLYWOOD CHANGED KORNGOLD 
IT DIDN'T KORNGOLD IN A WAY CHANGED THE WAY OTHER COMPOSERS WERE EXPECTED TO WRITE 
KORNGOLD DID TAKE THAT VIENNESE STYLE TO HOLLYWOOD 
AND MADE IT A GENRE IN HOLLYWOOD MOVIES THAT OTHER PEOPLE COPIED 
THESE SYMPHONIC ALL THIS SORT OF STUFF 
IT WAS THE SAME WITH A LOT OF THE RUSSIAN AND EASTERN EUROPEAN EMIGRES 
LIKE MIKLOS ROZSA AS WELL SAME THING EXCEPT HE DIDN'T GET THE RECOGNITION 
WE'RE BOOK ENDING TONIGHT'S CONCERT 
WE BEGAN WITH BEETHOVEN EIGHT ENDING WITH SCHUMANN TWO 
DOES THAT PROGRAMMING MAKE SENSE ARE THERE CONNECTIONS YOU CAN DRAW 
NOT REALLY NO 
I DON'T KNOW REALLY HOW YOU CAN FOLLOW THAT 
THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE HALL IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY AT THE MOMENT 
THE SCHUMANN IS COMING OUT OF A PERIOD WHEN HE HAD HAD A MASSIVE NERVOUS BREAKDOWN 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF MUSIC 
IT'S STRANGE STARTING A PROGRAMME WITH A SYMPHONY 
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO FINISH WITH ONE 
AFTER RISING TO THAT LEVEL OF SUPERCHARGED ALBEIT SUGARY EMOTION 
IT'S KIND OF A HARD THING TO FOLLOW 
THE SCHUMANN IS A RATHER EPIC JOURNEY IT BEGINS ABSOLUTELY IN DARKNESS 
HE WROTE IT DURING VERY DARK DAYS AND THEN EMERGES RESPLENDENT 
IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT SLOW MOVEMENTS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY A GREAT PIECE 
GOOD WELL WE LOOK FORWARD TO IT THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU 
GIANANDREA AND SCHUMANN'S SECOND SYMPHONY 
SCHUMANN'S SYMPHONY IN C. MAJOR NO TWO 
PERFORMED TONIGHT AT THE PROMS BY THE B. B. C. PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA CONDUCTED BY GIANANDREA NOSEDA 
GIANANDREA NOSEDA TOLD US EARLIER TODAY THAT FOR HIM 
SCHUMANN'S SECOND SYMPHONY IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ACHIEVEMENTS 
IN THE SYMPHONIC WORLD NEXT ONLY TO BEETHOVEN 
IT'S GOOD NIGHT FROM ALL OF US HERE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL
