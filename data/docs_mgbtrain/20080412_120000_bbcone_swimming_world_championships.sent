WELCOME TO THE ARENA IN 
MANCHESTER OFFICIALLY THE WORLD'S 
MOST POPULAR VENUE IN TERMS OF 
TICKET SALES THIS WEEK IT IS 
MAKING THE BIGGEST SPLASH OF ALL 
OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS THIS PLACE 
HAS BEEN COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED 
THEY HAVE STARTED AGAIN FROM THE 
BOTTOM UP THIS IS NORMALLY A 
CONCERT VENUE IT HAS BEEN PACKED 
OUT FOR KYLIE MINOGUE FOR TAKE 
THAT FOR ELTON JOHN YOU NAME IT 
THEY'VE PLAYED HERE TORVILL AND 
DEAN HAVE STATED HERE MIKE TYSON 
HAS FOUGHT IT BUT THIS WEEK TWO 
GIANT POLES HAD BEEN INSERTED INTO 
A FALSE FLOOR THINK OF THEM AS 
GREAT BIG PADDLING POOLS FOR THE 
WORLD'S BEST SAILORS DOWN HERE ARE 
THE BOWELS OF THE BUILDING TWO 
MILLION LITRES OF WATER ARE BEING 
PUMPED OUT IT IS A VERY GOOD 
FILTERING OPERATION BUT TO THINK 
MARK FOSTER IS TAKING IT TO 
EXTREMES OF HEAT TASTED BEFORE HE 
RACES UP HERE IS WHERE THE ACTION 
TAKES PLACE EVERY NOW AND THEN I 
CAN HEAR ROARS OF CHEERING FROM 
UPSTAIRS THERE HAS BEEN PLENTY OF 
BRITISH SUCCESS TO SCREAM ABOUT A 
GOLD AND SILVER MEDAL FOR LIAM 
TANCOCK THE BACKBONE OF BRITISH 
TALENT REBECCA ADLINGTON COULD 
HAPPILY INDULGE HER SHOE FETISH 
AFTER TAKING GOLD IN THE EIGHT HUNDRED F. T. 
FREESTYLE IT WAS REALLY AL WORLD 
RECORD AND BRITAIN'S THIRD GOLD A 
MOMENT SO FAR CAME COURTESY OF KRIS 
GILCHRIST EVEN HE WASN'T SURE HE 
WON BUT HE DID HAVE THE TOUCH TO 
REFLECT ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS SO FAR 
AND HELP PUT THEM IN CONTEXT AND 
JOINED BY TWO SIMILAR SUPERSTARS 
ADRIAN MOORHOUSE AND SHARRON DAVIES 
FIRST YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE COST 
OF THE AQUATIC CENTRE FOR LONDON 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF 
THEY MAY START TO CONSIDER A SET UP 
LIKE THIS AND IF SO WATCH 
CAREFULLY BECAUSE THIS IS HOW IT IS 
DONE 
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS 
PROJECT FOR NEARLY THREE AND A HALF 
YEARS 
FINALLY IT HAS COME TO YEARS FRUITION IN THE LAST MONTH WE USED 
IT WE'RE USED TO VENUES AND 
CONCERTS WHICH LAST HOURS AND DAYS 
AND WE ARE NOT USED TO HAVING 
SOMETHING TAKE OVER OUR BUILDING 
FOR THIRTY FOUR DAYS 
THE WHOLE BILL FROM 
START TO COMPLETION WAS TWELVE DAYS 
BUT IS A RECORD FOR US 
WE WERE 
SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE AFTER ABOUT 
SIXTEEN DAYS WE WERE ALMOST READY TO 
ACCEPT THEM AS 
THIRD CHAMPIONSHIP 
POLE IS TWENTY FIVE METRES BY TWENTY FIVE METRES AND 
TWO METRES DEEP THERE WILL OH TWO FIVE 
ONE TWENTY FIVE MILLION LITRES OF 
POOL WATER THERE THERE IS QUITE 
A LOT OF WATER THERE BECAUSE THE 
ANYTHING ARENA IS AN ICE PAD WE 
CANNOT FIX ANYTHING TO THE FLOOR OF 
THE READER SO WE USED A SUSPENDED 
STRUCTURE WE THEN PUT A FALSE 
FLOOR OVER THE TOP OF THESE CRADLES 
WE THEN PUT P. V. C. MEMBRANE INSIDE IT 
FOR IT AT ALL TO COME OFF YOU GO 
AS YOU CAN SEE THIS FROM A LOOK 
PERMANENT BUT IT IS TWENTY FIVE METRES 
ABOVE THE NORMAL FLOOR IF YOU GO 
UNDERNEATH YOU WILL SEE THOUSANDS 
OF MILES OF PRIVATE WORK THE WATER 
TREATMENT PLANT THE WALKWAYS SO 
PEOPLE CAN GET AROUND THE BUILDING 
BELOW THE D. E. C. ARE A CONSIDERABLE 
NUMBER OF TANKS FILTERS AND PUMPS 
TOGETHER WITH TWO VERY LARGE HEAT 
PUMPS AND A GENERATOR WHICH WE HAVE 
TO BRING IN ESPECIALLY FOR HEATING 
THE POLL 
THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR 
US WAS GETTING THE HEAT UP AND 
ALSO THE CHEMICAL LEVELS IT HAS 
ACHIEVED VERY NICELY AND FOR IN 
FACT THE WATER WAS TOO HOT THE THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN GETTING THE 
WATER IN IT AND GETTING IT OUT 
QUICKLY SO WE CAN DO EVERYTHING 
ELSE THE SHEER WEIGHT OF THE POOL 
ON OUR BUILDING ON THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE WE GOT A SHOW 
COMING IN AS SOON AS THIS EVENT 
FINISHES AND I'VE GOT TO BE READY 
FOR THAT WELL 
WE HAVE TO BE OUT BY 
MIDNIGHT ON TWENTY FIRST APRIL WE HAVE TO 
BE OUT OF THE ARENA EVERYTHING HAS 
TO BE GONE THAT WILL BE A 
CHALLENGE IN ITSELF OTHERWISE OTHERWISE CELINE DION WILL BE SLIGHTLY 
SURPRISED THE SOLOS LOVE THAT 
THEY MUST DO THEY ARE SETTING 
GREAT TIMES 
ABSOLUTELY WE SAYS A 
LOT OF EUROPEAN RECORDS WE HAVE 
SET A LOT 
THE ATMOSPHERE IS 
ELECTRIC BECAUSE THE AREA IS 
CONFINED PEOPLE 
ARE LOVING IT YOU YOU ARE TELLING 
ME YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT MELBOURNE WHAT DID THEY 
DO THERE 
THIS STRUCTURE HAS BEEN 
GOING TO DIFFERENT VENUES AND IN 
MELBOURNE THEY USED THE TO 
GIVE WATER TO THE PLANTS IN THE 
BIOLOGICAL GARDENS ACROSS THE ROAD 
A IT'S GO TO THE WOMEN'S TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THE 
FIRE THE FASTEST QUALIFIER FOR 
THIS WAS BRITISH SUMMER SWIMMER 
JEMMA LOWE FROM GREAT BRITAIN IN 
LANE FOUR WAS GOING FAST JESS 
DICKENS HE WAS SEVENTEEN WAS IN LANE THREE THEY BIG PRESSURE SITUATION HERE 
THE TWO BRITISH GIRLS GOING IN THE 
FASTEST AND THIRD FASTEST VERY 
NERVOUS TIMES SHE IS GOING OUT 
QUICK 
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO QUICK MANAGE THOSE TERMS NERVES THIS IS A GREATER BUT SHIRTY FOR A 
COUPLE OF METAL SIEVE THIS IS 
GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR A COUPLE OF 
METALS HERE IF YOU GET POINTS FOR GOING FOR IT 
JEMMA LOWE HAS AN AWFUL LOT OF 
POINTS AND BAD IF YOU GO OUT TO 
CLICK ON TWO HUNDRED FLY IT CAN HIT SHE 
REALLY HAS GONE FOR IT 
THE HOPE 
SHE CAN HOLD ON TO IT BECAUSE THERE 
WILL BE NOTHING BETTER FOR THE 
BRITISH CROWD TO SEE A GREAT BREAK 
A WORLD RECORD IN A HER HOME POLL 
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN LIAM 
TANCOCK DID THAT IN SHEFFIELD THAT 
WAS A BIT OF A SLOW TURNER THERE 
JEMMA LOWE 
IS HOLDING ON TO IT SHE SHE IS RIGHT AND THAT WORLD RECORD LINE 
COME ON SHE IS LOOKING GOOD THIS 
COULD GO ANYWHERE IT LOOKS LIKE 
THE AMERICAN IS FINISHING FASTER 
IT WILL BE TOUGH DOWN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE 
METRES 
JEMMA LOWE HAS DONE ALL THE METRES WORK FOR THE WORLD RECORD JUST 
DICKENS COMING BACK VERY STRONGLY 
ONE OF THESE WOMEN IS GOING TO GET 
VERY CLOSE TO WORLD RECORD TIME 
THE AMERICAS TO ME AS THE WORLD 
CHAMPION THE AMERICAN SWIMMER 
HAS THE WORLD RECORD CHESTERTONS CHESTERTONS IS A NEW BRITISH RECORD HOLDER A 
BRILLIANT SOME FOR HER JS 
DICKENS LET'S MOVE ON TO THE WOMEN'S FOUR HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY THE EFFORT IS GOING TO BE HAVE TO 
MAKE NOW IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE 
HANNAH MILEY HAS OVERSTRETCHED 
ITSELF THIS IS VERY VERY FAST KIRSTY COVENTRY IS GOING FOR IT 
RIGHT NOW THIS MORNING IN THE 
HEATS THE BREASTSTROKE LEG WAS 
GOOD FOR HANNAH MILEY HANNAH MILEY 
ARE STARTING TO COME BACK 
THIS IS 
GREAT I DON'T THINK SHE HAS DONE 
TOO MUCH L. THINK HANNAH MILEY HAS 
SAVED SOMETHING WHICH IS GREAT TO 
SEE THIS IS COVENTRY'S WEEKS SPOT BOTH OF THESE WOMEN COULD GET CLOSE TO WORLD RECORD TIME SIX AND SEVEN ARE HAVING A REAL BATTLE NOW 
AT THE MOMENT TO DISTIL NOW COVENTRY BUT COMING BACK IS HANNAH 
MILEY FOUR LENGTHS FREESTYLE TO GO AND 
KIRSTY COVENTRY LEADING BY ABOUT 
SIX METRES SHE IS UNDER WORLD 
RECORD PACE STILL SHE IS TWO 
SECONDS UNDERNEATH A WORLD RECORD 
PACE HAS SHE GONE TOO QUICKLY I I THINK COVENTRY SHOULD HOLD ON TO 
THIS ACTUALLY SHE LOOKS STRONG 
THESE THREE WILL GET THE MEDALS 
THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A DISASTER 
FOR COVENTRY TO LOSE THIS NOW SHE SHE IS STILL TWO SECONDS AND THE WORLD 
RECORD PACE BUT COMING BACK VERY 
FAST IS THE SPANISH SWIMMER SHE IS 
IN THE SILVER HAD CLOSE TO US IT 
SEEMS TO BE SPURRING ON HIGH NET 
HANNAH MILEY HANNAH MILEY THE EIGHTEEN 
YEAR OLD IS COMING BACK HIS KIRSTY 
COVENTRY GOING TO HOLD ON KIRSTY 
COVENTRY IS THE WORLD CHAMPION OVER 
SHORT COURSE IT IS A NEW WORLD 
RECORD A BRILLIANT SWIM FROM HER 
AND HANNAH MILEY HAS A WRECK 
HANNAH MILEY HAS AGAIN GONE UNDER 
THE COMMONWEALTH RECORD A MASSIVE 
BRITISH RECORD AGAIN BOTH WOMEN 
HAVE BROKEN THE OLD WORLD RECORDS 
THIS IS GREAT PROGRESSION FOR 
HANNAH MILEY THE GOLD TO ZIMBABWE SILVER TO HANNAH MILEY AND GREAT BRITAIN IT 
IS A WAY VERY RICH SEAM OF SWIMMING 
AT THE MOMENT PARTICULARLY AMONG 
BRITAIN'S WOMEN FOUR OF THEM 
LINKED UP FOR THE FOUR BY TWO HUNDRED METRE 
RELAY WE WILL JOIN IT ON THE THIRD 
LEG LEG THIS IS THE HALFWAY MARK HOLLAND 
GOING FIRST GREAT BRITAIN SECOND 
AUSTRALIA THIRD AMERICA WAY DOWN 
AND FOR 
THEY ARE FOUR SECONDS 
UNDER THE WORLD RECORD SPLIT THE 
DUTCH TEAM MARLENE REVEALED HIS IS 
QUICK 
VELDHUIS THE DUTCH AT THE TOP OF THE PICTURE 
HAVE OPENED UP A COMMANDING LEAD 
NOW BUT ACTUALLY HAS TO BRIDGE THE 
GAP BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIANS AND 
DUTCH CAITLIN MCCLATCHEY HAS TO 
BRIDGE THE GAP 
CAITLIN MCCLATCHEY 
IS MUCH BETTER ON A FOUR HUNDRED METRES 
FREESTYLE BY WHAT HOPE SHE IS 
GOING TO START ROLLING THE MEN IT 
IS CAIRO IT IS TIME TO MOVE NOW 
CAITLIN IF REBECCA ADLINGTON IS GOING TO 
WIN THIS FOR GREAT BRITAIN AT THE 
END SHE WILL HAVE TO HAVE A 
MASSIVE FINAL LEG CAITLIN 
MCCLATCHEY IS TOUGHING IT OUT ALL ALL THREE TEAMS ARE UNDER THE WORLD 
RECORD AND THE L. AM PRETTY SURE 
WE WILL SEE A WORLD RECORD THE 
QUESTION IS CAN THE BRITS BRIDGE 
THE GAP HERE WE GO CAITLIN 
MCCLATCHEY TWO LENGTHS TO GO L. 
THINK ADLINGTON NEEDS A LITTLE BIT 
MORE THAN THIS WE'VE GOT OUR 
FASTER OR SLOWER AT THE END THAT 
GAP IS CLOSING BUT IT NEEDS TO COME 
CLOSER 
THE GAP IS CLOSING VERY CLOSER QUICKLY 
VELDHUIS IS THE 
EUROPEAN RECORD HOLDER AT THE ONE HUNDRED 
METRES FREESTYLE SHE HAS HAD A 
GREAT LEG BUT CAITLIN MCCLATCHEY 
HAS CAUGHT IT HOLLAND WON A 
GREAT BRITAIN TOO THE DUTCH JUST EIGHT SECONDS AND 
THE WORLD RECORD BE GUARANTEED 
WORLD RECORD HERE YOU ARE WATCHING 
THE THIRD WORLD RECORD OF THE 
EVENING THE QUESTION IS WHETHER 
THE BRITS AND THE AUSTRALIANS CAN 
BRIDGE THE GAP THINK IT IS TOO 
MUCH YOU KNOW ADLINGTON WOULD 
HAVE TO SWIM THE SWIM OF HER LIFE 
SHE IS GOING TO CAPTURE L. THINK 
REBECCA ADDINGTON IS GOING TO DO IT 
YOU KNOW L. WONDER OF THE DUTCH ARE 
PLAYING WITH US THE AUSTRALIANS 
ARE NOT OUT OF ITS NOW AT ALL 
HOLLAND IN THE BLACK CAP THEY ARE 
LEADING THIS IS THE HUNDRED WE 
TOOK TURNS SO THERE ARE STILL FOUR 
LEGS TO GO REBECCA ADLINGTON IS 
CATCHING UP OH MY GOODNESS ME IT 
IS GOING TO BE A WORLD RECORD AND 
HIS GREAT BRITAIN GOING TO GET IT 
THEY'VE HAD A SILVER MEDAL SO FAR 
A THEY HAVE A BRONZE MEDAL SO FAR 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING TO BE A 
GOLD AS WELL 
I TELL YOU WHAT YOU 
NEED TO START BETTING BECAUSE I 
THINK ADDINGTON CAN CATCH THIS L. 
WONDER IF THE DUTCH HAVE LEFT 
ANYTHING HOLLAND AT THE TOP OF 
YOUR PICTURE ADLINGTON WILL BE THE 
HERO OF THIS WEEK IF SHE CATCHES 
THIS THE DUTCH ARE DIGGING IN DEEP 
IT IS GOING TO BE SO CLOSE THE 
DUTCH WOMAN HAS SHE LEFT 
SOMETHING LOOK AT THE AUSTRALIAN 
WOMAN AS WELL COMING BACK THE 
DUTCH ARE STILL HANGING ON THE 
AUSTRALIANS ARE THERE IT IS 
HOLLAND OH MY WORD ITS HOLLAND 
THEY GOT THE TOUCH THE GOLD HAS 
GONE TO HOLLAND THE SILVER TO 
GREAT BRITAIN AUSTRALIA GET THE 
BRONZE A MASSIVE WORLD RECORD IT 
IS I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW THAT DUTCH 
WOMAN SWAM THAT LAST RECORD SHE 
WAS SO SLOW FOR SO LONG REBECCA 
ADLINGTON WHAT TEST FIRM THAT 
WAS WHAT A GREAT WASTE THAT RACE WHAT WAS THE DEAL THAT MIGHT COST GOT MADE WITH THE SUMS 
HE HAS SAID IF THEY CAN BREAK THE 
WORLD RECORD AND WIN A GOLD MEDAL 
HE SAID HE WOULD SHAVE HIS HEAD HE HE WAS SIX WILL HUNDREDTHS AWAY FROM 
LOSING HIS HAIR 
YOU CANNOT SHOW 
HIM HOW TO DO IT HE MAY HAVE 
NOTICED THAT A LOT OF SUMMERS IN 
THE RELAY WERE WEARING A NEW SUIT 
WHICH HELPS THEM CUT THROUGH A 
WATER LIKE A KNIFE THROUGH BUTTER 
WHEN A MANUFACTURER COMES UP WITH 
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO GIVE HIS 
FORMER AN ADVANTAGE THEY ALL SIT 
UP AND TAKE NOTICE 
THE AIM IS TO CUT THROUGH THE WATER 
WITH THE UTMOST EASE AND THE SUIT 
COSTS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MADE TO MEASURE BECAUSE 
ONE SIZE MOST DEFINITELY WILL NOT 
FIT ALL IT WOULD LOOK GOOD ON THE 
CATWALK OR ON CAT WOMAN NINETEEN WORLD 
RECORDS HAVE BEEN BROKEN SINCE 
FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN WEARING THIS SUIT 
INCLUDING LIAM TANCOCK 
IF SOME OF 
THEIR FASTEST TIMES IN THE WORLD 
ARE BEING PRODUCED AT THE MOMENT IN 
THIS SUIT 
I FEEL LIKE I AM SERVING 
DOWNHILL WHEN I PUT IT ON IT IT REALLY GIVES YOU THE FEELING OF 
SLICING THROUGH THE WATER VERY 
QUICKLY 
THEY HAVE MADE AN QUICKLY ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC PRODUCT IN 
THESE SEEDS AND I AM SURE WALK 
MORE WORLD RECORDS WILL GO PLENTY PLENTY OF RESEARCH HAS GONE INTO THIS IT 
TOOK THREE YEARS TO DEVELOP AND WAS 
TESTED BY NASA PURSUED WORKS BY 
REDUCING THE FRICTION AND TRIED 
THAT SLOWS THEY SAW ME DOWN THE 
AIM IS TO MAKE THESE WELL AS BODY 
AS STREAMLINED AS POSSIBLE MARK 
FOSTER WILL HAVE TRIED OUT MOST 
SWIMSUITS IN HIS CAREER SO WHAT 
DOES HE THINK OF THIS WILL 
IT IS REALLY LIKE ISN'T IT WHAT 
MAKES IT SO SPECIAL 
THE OLD SUIT 
WAS CALLED A PRO AT CERTAIN POINTS 
THEY PUT SILICON OVER THE TOP THE 
BIGGEST THING TO ME IS THE FACT 
THEY TOOK THE SEAMERS AND IT IS 
BONDED 
THERE IS NO STITCHING BONDED WHICH IS THE BIGGEST THING IT IS 
ABOUT THE FLOW OF WATER ACROSS YOUR 
BODY 
IS IT COMFORTABLE THEY'RE BODY THEY'RE NOT BAD BUT THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE 
IS CERTAIN PARTS 
IT IS PART MIND 
PART BODY WHATEVER IT DOES FOR 
TIMES 
MENTAL 
STATE OF THE SUMMER 
THERE ARE LOTS 
OF DIFFERENT ADVANTAGES TO THE 
DIFFERENCES ON THE MARKET AT THE 
MOMENT I HAVE DEFINED WHICH ONE 
MENTALLY I FEEL MOST COMFORTABLE 
IN 
I LIKE IT A LOT MORE FOR THREE IN STAR THE IDEA FOR BUTTERFLY AND 
TRY TO GET USED TO IT FOR BUTTERFLY 
I WILL PROBABLY NEEDED AT THIS RATE 
FALSE MODESTY THERE FROM RYAN 
LOCHTE THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF 
CONTROVERSY ABOUT THIS SUIT IRINA 
A RIVAL BENEFACTOR PUT A FULL PAGE 
OPEN LETTER TO THE TELEGRAPH 
YESTERDAY SAY WHAT IS GOING ON 
HERE WHY IS IT CAUSING SUCH PROBLEM 
ORIGINALLY IT WAS NOT PROBLEM AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY IT WAS 
BANNED AT THE CANADIAN TRIALS THEY 
WOULD NOT LET THE ATHLETES USE IT 
SO THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD BALLOT 
RULES SAY IT SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO 
FLOAT OR HELP WITH BUOYANCY 
DO YOU 
THINK IT HELPS YOU FLOAT 
I THINK 
IT IS A FUSS ABOUT NOTHING HER 
THINK MANUFACTURERS ARE MAKING P. R. 
ABOUT IT AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
IT 
A FORMER SHORT COURSE WORLD IT CHAMPION SAYS IT IS DEMEANING TO 
THESE WORLD CHAMPIONS 
IT IS A 
GREAT SID IT IS A GREAT SID L. 
WOULD WEAR ONE ON THE OTHER HAND 
IT THINK IT IS DOMINATING WHAT IS 
FANTASTIC TRAINING IMPROVED 
COACHING IMPROVED METHODS OF 
SEVILLE IT HAS BECOME THIS TOUR 
THAT I AM BORED OF 
IN THAT CASE 
WE WILL MOVE ON BUT SO CUT OR 
SWIMMING THE THIRTY METRE BREASTSTROKE FEATURED 
A FORMER 
GREAT BRITAIN'S ZOE BAKER 
THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER IN THREE THE IN LANE 
SIX EFIMOVA DEFINITELY MOVED 
WHETHER SHE WAS STILL ON NOT BY THE 
TIME THE GUN WENT I DON'T KNOW 
JESSICA HARDY HAS HAD A GOOD 
STARTING TO THIS WILL BE 
INTERESTING BECAUSE SHE GOT SUCH A 
BAD ONE IN THE SENATE L. THINK SHE 
WAS THE FASTEST STRUMMER SWIMMER 
EFIMOVA IS COMING BACK EFIMOVA IS 
IN THE SUMMER CAP SHE IS COMING 
BACK BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING 
TO BE HARDER HARDY GREAT 
BRITAIN'S KATE HAYWOOD HAS GOT A 
BRONZE AS WELL THAT IS A GREAT 
SWIM FOR KATE HAYWOOD WHAT A HUGE 
WORLD RECORD EFIMOVA WAS MOVING 
AND WAS DISQUALIFIED WHICH MEANT 
KATE HAYWOOD WITH DUP AND TWO 
SILVER MEDAL POSITION AND SHED THAT 
WITH THE AUSTRALIAN SWIMMER MOVING ON TO THE MEN'S ONE HUNDRED METRE 
BACKSTROKE IT WAS OVER HALF THIS 
DISTANCE WHICH LIAM TANCOCK SET THE 
WORLD RECORD LAST WEEK HE WAS IN 
THE SLOWEST QUALIFIER MATE LANE 
EIGHT EIGHT THE BIG GUYS ARE OR THREE FOUR AND FIVE 
ALONG WITH A ALONG WITH LANE 
EIGHT THE RACE IS GOING TO BE WON AND 
LOST ON THE TERMS A GOOD START FOR 
TANCOCK 
THIS IS UNDER WORLD RECORD TANCOCK PACE LIAM TANCOCK WILL STRUGGLE TO 
KEEP US GOING I THINK L. REALLY 
HOPE HE DOES THIS TERM IS WHERE 
THE BIG GUYS GO 
TANCOCK IS STILL 
LEADING THEY HAD TEN METRES TO GO 
TANCOCK IS THE LEADING ROLE 
TANCOCK HAS GOT THE TOUCH FIVE THOUSAND FOURTEEN A 
MASSIVE NEW BRITISH RECORD THAT IS 
STUNNING IT IS A COMMONWEALTH 
RECORD AS WELL IT IS EUROPEAN RECORD AS WELL THAT IS ONLY JUST 
OUTSIDE THE WORLD RECORD WHICH IS 
HELD BY RYAN LOCHTE OF THE U. S. A. A A FANTASTIC SWIM 
THAT IS THE SECOND 
FASTEST SWIM IN THE HISTORY LIAM 
TANCOCK MASTERFUL HE RARELY 
PLAYED TO HIS STRENGTH WHICH WAS TO 
GET OUT THERE HE OBVIOUSLY HAD 
SOMETHING LEFT IN HIS TANK THE THE REST OF THEM WERE NOT EXPECTING IT 
WE DID SAY THEY ATE WAS A GOOD NAME 
LANE EIGHT WAS A GOOD LANE AND 
PLEASE FOR THE BRITISH TEAM IT IS 
THEIR FIRST BRITISH GOLD MEDAL SO SO NOW A MAN HAS GOT A GOLD MEDAL L. 
DID SAY I THOUGHT THE RACE WAS 
GOING TO BE WON AND LOST UNDER 
WATER THAT WAS A SUPER LAST TERM 
HE DOESN'T NORMALLY DO A GOOD TURN 
ON THE LAST TIN 
WELL TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IS THE 
YEAR TO STEP UP THAT IS FOR SURE 
THAT TIME FIVE THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE BRITISH 
RECORD WAS FIVE HUNDRED FOURTEEN WHICH HE SET IN 
LEEDS DON'T FORGET LIAM TANCOCK HAS THE 
THIRTY METRE BACKSTROKE TO COME TONIGHT 
WE WILL BE SHOWING THAT LIVE AT 
FOUR FORTY P. M. YOU SAW REBECCA ADLINGTON 
IT JUST MISSING OUT ON A GOLD MEDAL 
EARLIER SHE WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE 
UP FOR THAT IN THE EIGHT HUNDRED METRE 
FREESTYLE SHE IS ONLY SIX SHE IS IN LANE SIX YOU AND BRIDGE A GAP FROM ONE 
TO ANOTHER IT IS DIFFICULT TO DO IT 
IS AND THE EUROPEAN RECORD IS SET 
BY LAURA MANAUDOU HE GOING OUT 
VERY FAST AND BLOWS UP AND I HAVE 
TO TELL YOU THAT ADDLE ON THE HAS 
GONE OUT FASTER IT IS WELL UNDER 
THE BRITISH TIME NOT FAR OFF THE 
WORLD RECORD PACE THIS IS GOOD 
SWIMMING ADLINGTON STARTING TO 
REACT TO THE CROWD TOO SHE LOOKS 
GOOD THE QUESTION OF WHETHER SHE 
HAD ENOUGH IN HER TANK HAS BEEN 
ANSWERED HERE SHE STILL HAS WAY 
TO GO 
SHE HAS BUT WITH THE 
DISTANCE SWIMMERS THEY USUALLY SET 
UP A PACE BUT YOU DON'T BLOW UP IN 
THE SAME WAY AS YOU DO IN SPACE 
YOU MIGHT DROP HALF A SECOND BUT 
THAT WON'T ADD UP TO ENOUGH FOR THE 
REST OF THE FIELD TO GET HER SHE SHE IS FIVE METRES AHEAD OF THE FIELD 
AT THE MOMENT THE SPLIT WAS FIVE HUNDRED FIVE 
HE HAS GONE FIFTY FIFTY TWO ZEEG HER CAME 
BACK FAST WHEN SHE DID THAT SO 
ADLINGTON IS LEADING SPAIN IS 
SECOND PALMER OF AUSTRALIA IS 
THIRD AND GREAT BRITAIN'S JO 
JACKSON IN FOURTH 
A LOT OF NOISE 
RIGHT NOW THEY KEEP ON MAKING 
NOISE AT THE TURN BUT YOU WANT 
THEM ON THEIR FEET THIS COULD BE A 
WORLD RECORD 
SHE IS STARTING TO GO 
AWAY FROM IT L. SAID THAT KATE ZEEG 
HER CAME BACK VERY FAST THE TRIEM 
IS GREATER GREATER AND GREATER 
ADLINGTON LOOKS GOOD SHE DOESN'T 
LOOK LIKE SHE IS SUFFERING SHE IS 
USING HER LEGS WELL SHE IS STILL 
NICE AND LONG THE WORLD RECORD 
SPLIT WELL SHE IS STILL SIX TENTH 
OF A SECOND UNDER NEAT IT ZIEGLER 
CAME BACK WELL THE LAST PERSON WE 
SAW WAS SARAH HARD CASTLE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
AND THAT WAS THE RECORD ADLINGTON 
BROKE LAST WEEK TO QUALIFY FOR 
BEIJING SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A 
PUNISHING NOW THIS IS WHERE IT 
WILL TELL THIS IS WHERE THE ENERGY 
THAT HAS TAKE INTO GET TO THE 
OLYMPICS WILL BE PAYING IF SHE CAN 
DO THIS IT WILL BE A PHENOMENAL 
WEEK FOR THIS WOMAN PHENOMENAL 
TWO WEEKS FOR THIS WOMAN BILL 
FURNESS HER COACH HAS DONE VERY 
WELL WITH HER HE REALLY HAS LOOKED 
AFTER HER SO WELL SO ONLY A COUPLE 
OF LENGTHS TO GO GOOD KICK OFF 
THAT WALL THAT LOOKS GOOD THE 
REST OF THE FIELD STILL SORT OF 
WITH HER HALL MER OF AUSTRALIA A 
FEW METRES BACK THIS REALLY NOW 
ABOUT NINETEEN YEAR OLD REBECCA ADLINGTON 
FROM NOTTINGHAM SHE IS STILL UNDER 
WORLD RECORD PACE IT IS TIGHT 
THOUGH SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHT THERE THE WORLD 
RECORD IS EIGHT MINUTES IT IS TOUGH 
I AM NOT SURE IF SHE HAS ENOUGH IN 
HER LEGS HOPE SO WE SAW 
FANTASTIC SPEED IF SHE HAS 
ANYTHING LEFT IN THE TANK THERE IS 
THE RED LINE OF THE WORLD RECORD 
SHE IS AHEAD PALMER IS TRYING TO 
BRIM THE GAP ADLINGTON KEEP AHEAD 
OF THAT LINE 
I THINK SHE IS GOING 
TO DO IT SHE HAS TO COME BACK IN 
TWENTY NINE POINT THREE NINE I THINK SHE CAN DO COME ON 
REBECCA ADLINGTON SHE SWAM A 
BRILLIANT TWO HUNDRED METRES TO QUALIFY L. 
THINK SHE IS GOING TO GET THE WORLD 
RECORD HERE THE CROWD ON ON THEIR 
FEET REBECCA ADLINGTON IS HUNTING 
DOWN THE WORLD RECORD THE TIME WE 
ARE LOOKING FOR IS EIGHT MINUTES 
EIGHT POINT OH OH COME ON QUARTER OF A SECOND 
OUTSIDE THAT HURTS SO BADLY BUT 
WHAT A GREAT SWIM WORLD CHAMPION 
AND EIGHT MINUTES EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THAT WOULD 
HAVE HURT SHE IS DELIGHTED BUT HOW 
DEEP DID SHE DIG 
THAT WAS TOUGH 
THAT WAS REALLY HARD AND JUST NOT 
QUITE ENOUGH IN THE TANK THAT GIRL 
HAS GIVEN EVERYTHING L. TELL YOU 
WHAT PALMER SWAM WELL TO PUSH HER 
JO JACKSON OES RECORD HAS BEEN 
DESTROYED SHE CAME IN SIXTH THE 
OLD BRITISH RECORD OF EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTEEN POINT FIVE HAS 
GONE JUST MISSING THE WORLD RECORD 
AND THAT WILL WELL THAT WAS GOING 
TO GIVE HER A BOOST FOR THOSE 
OLYMPIC GAMES 
SHE MUST BE ON TOP 
OF THE WORLD NOW SHE IS THE WORLD 
CHAMPION THE WORLD CHAMPION OF 
THE WOMEN'S EIGHT HUNDRED METRES FREESTYLE 
SHE ATTACKED IT ADDS WELL AND SHE 
IS STILL ENJOYING IT BECAUSE SHE IS 
ALLOWED TO HAVE THE WEEKEND OFF AND 
SHE IS BACK IN TRAINING ON MONDAY 
AND SHE HAS NO IDEA SHE WAS THAT 
CLOSE TO A WORLD RECORD TIME BUT 
REBECCA ADLINGTON IS THE NEW 
CHAMPION HERE MORE RELAYING ACTION 
NOW AND ANOTHER THRILLING ONE 
AUSTRALIA THE NETHERLANDS U. S. AND 
GREAT BRITAIN MAKING THIS A STRONG 
LINE UP ITALY AS WELL TIGHT TAKE 
OVER AS WELL SO THE HALF WAY MARK 
OF THIS FINAL OF THE MENS FOUR BY 
TWO HUNDRED GREAT BRITAIN HAD A GOOD START 
ROBBIE RENWICK LIFETIME BEST 
ANDREW HUNTER IN FOR GREAT BRITAIN 
AT THE TOP THERE AUSTRALIA NOW 
GOING VERY WELL U. S. A. IN THIRD 
POSITION AND HOLLAND IN FOURTH AT 
THE MOMENT THAT WAS A GREAT SWIM 
FROM DAVID CARRY HUNTER HAS HIS 
WORK CUT OUT HE IS AGAINST 
SPRINGER HE WAS IN THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
OLYMPIC GAMES SEEMS LIKE THE ORDER 
HAS BEEN RESTORED IT LIKED LIKE 
THE ALLANS HAD COME UP AND THE 
DUTCH BUT YOU YOU HAVE AUSTRALIA 
OUT IN FRONT YOU HAVE BRITAIN IN 
SECOND PLACE AND THE REST SCRAPPING 
FOR BRONZE THIS IS OMINOUS FOR 
AUSTRALIA BECAUSE THEIR FINAL 
SWIMMER MONK WON THE INDIVIDUAL AND 
HE WAS TWENTY EIGHT SECOND FASTER THAN GREAT 
BRITAIN'S FASTEST SWIMMER LOOK AT 
THIS THIS IS VERY IMPRESSIVE AND 
IT LOOKS STRONG REALLY VERY STRONG 
INDEED SO AUSTRALIA NICK SPRINGER 
HE HAS TWO LENGTHS TO GO AND WE 
HAVE THE FINAL LEG GREAT BRITAIN 
THIS IS A SUPER SWIM FOR THEM AND 
HE IS WELL OUT NOW WELL OUT IN THE 
SILVER MEDAL POSITION ANDREW 
HUNTER A GREAT SWIM FOR THE TEAM 
NOW WE HAVE ROSS DAVENPORT COMING 
HUNTER IS GETTING CLOSE BUT WHEN 
THE AUSTRALIANS SET THE WORLD 
RECORD MONK WON IT ON THE BACK END 
SO HE HAS FANTASTIC CLASS FAIRLY 
SLOW TAKE OVER FOR AUSTRALIA 
MAKING SURE DAVENPORT HAS HIS WORK 
KOUT OUT MONK MUST HAVE SOMETHING 
HERE 
MONK HAS GONE OFF LIKE A SHOT HERE BUT THIS WILL BE INTERESTING 
BECAUSE ROSS DAVENPORT LOVING THE 
SITUATION HE IS TRACKING DOWN THE 
AUSTRALIAN HE IS TRACKING DOWN 
MONK THE GOLD MEDALLIST ON THE TWO HUNDRED 
METRES VERY IMPRESSIVE SWIM THEY 
HAVE REST THE FIELD FOR DEAD 
AMERICA IN THE BRONZE MEDAL 
POSITION AT THE MOMENT WITH ITALY 
IN FOURTH AND THEY WILL SCRAP IT 
OUT BUT AUSTRALIA AT THE MOMENT IN 
GOLD BUT COMING BACK IS ROSS 
DAVENPORT DAVEN MONTH PORT IS 
GOING FOR IT 
THIS WOULD BE THE 
SWIM OF A LIFETIME IF HE CAN 
OVERHAUL MONK THIS WOULD BE 
TREMENDOUS THE CROWD JUST ABOUT 
TO GET NOISY NOW THEY NEED TO 
BECAUSE BRITAIN ARE LESS THAN TWO 
TENTHS OF A SECOND BEHIND AND THE 
GOLD MEDAL IS UP FOR GRABS 
MONK IS 
QUICK DOWN THE SECOND HALF VERY 
QUICK BUT THE CROWD BEHIND 
DAVENPORT DAVENPORT HAS A HUGE LEG 
GOING HERE HE STILL HAS TWO LEGS 
TO GO SO MONK OF AUSTRALIA AT THE 
TOP OF THE PICTURE DAVENPORT SWAM 
A BLINDING FIRST SIX LENGTHSFUL HE 
HAS TWO LENGTHS TO GO THE CROWD 
REALLY GETTING INTO IT CAN 
DAVENPORT HOLD ON MONK IS STARTING 
TO MOVE HE IS A BIG POWERFUL CHAP 
BUT HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE IS 
GETTING AWAY TOO FAR IS THIS THE 
FINAL TURN NOW 
MONK IS LOOKING 
OVER AT DAVENPORT HE CAN'T SEE 
THEM IT LOOKS LIKE MONK HAS TAKEN 
THE GAP NOW 
LOOK AT THAT THE GOLD 
MEDAL HAS GONE TO AUSTRALIA BUT 
WHAT A BRILLIANT SWIM FOR THE 
BRITISH TEAM A MASSIVE BRITISH 
RECORD FOR THEM C. H. IT WAS A SUPER 
SWIM SIX MINUTES FIFTY SIX THE BRITISH 
RECORD WAS SEVEN HUNDRED THREE SO THEY HAVE GONE 
SEVEN SECONDS DONEER THE BRITISH 
RECORD A BRILLIANT SILVER MEDAL 
COULDN'T CATCH THE AUSTRALIANS BUT 
MUCH CLOSER THAN I THOUGHT 
AUSTRALIA TOOK THE COLD MEDAL JUST 
A QUICK REFLECTION ON OUR GOLD 
MEDAL ON THAT SECOND DAY 
SHE WON THE TRIALS LAST WEEK AND 
TWO HUNDRED THE FOUR HUNDRED AND THE EIGHT 
HUNDRED THAT PRESENTS HER WITH A 
DILEMMA BUT REAL QUALITY RACE 
JUST TO MISS THAT WORLD RECORD WE 
WERE TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE THEY 
WILL PUT A CLOCK IN THE POSITION 
THE ATHLETES CAN SEE IT IF SHE HAD 
KNOWN ONE HUNDRED METRES FROM THE END SHE 
WOULD HAVE GONE FOR IT THERE IS NO 
CODE SIGNAL THAT CAN COME FROM 
ANYONE IN THE CROWD WORLD RECORD 
WERE WERE SAY AGO BIG WHISTLE BUT 
YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR COACH IT IS 
LIKE A NIGHTCLUB BUT YOU CAN'T SEE 
A COACH IN A NIGHTCLUB YOU COULD 
IN A NORMALLY LIT DAYLIGHT SWIMMING 
POOL YOU MIGHT HAVE A COACH THAT 
COULD GIVE YOU A SIGN 
WHAT ABOUT 
LIAM TANCOCK HE WILL BE WALKING 
BIG AND TALL COMING TO BEIJING 
OUTSIDE LANE DID HIS OWN THING AND 
HE IS CONFIDENT WE KNEW HE WAS 
CAPABLE OF IT 
MARCH APRIL TIME FOR 
THE SWIMMERS IT WILL GIVE HIM 
CONFIDENCE WE HAVE SUCH A RANGE OF 
INDIVIDUALS WE HAVE TWELVE INDIVIDUALS 
GETTING TO MEDALS 
ONE WOULD ASSUME 
THE FIFTY METRES IS HIS FAVOURED 
DISTANCE HE IS GOING IN THAT 
TONIGHT 
HE IS I I AM SURE HE WILL TONIGHT GO INTO WIN IT HE USUALLED TO 
SPECIALISE IN THE FIFTY BUT IT IS NOT 
THE OLYMPIC PROGRAMME SO HE HAS TO 
HAD TO MOVE UP 
IN THE FIFTY METRE HE 
WAS FOURTEEN HUNDREDTH OFF A WORLD RECORD 
SO IF SHE SHAVES BETWEEN THEN AND 
NOW COULD THAT MAKE THE DIFFERENCE 
IT COULD DO 
AND PUTS THE SUIT ON 
LET US LOOK AT DAY THREE AND A WOMAN'S CELEBRATING THE FIFTY 
METRE FREESTYLE IS WHAT WE WILL 
START WITH BECAUSE WE WILL TALK TO 
MARK FOSTER AND WE CAN SEE WHY NICE CLEAN START AS WELL AND A 
GOOD START FROM FOSTER FIRST UP IN 
THE WATER MARK FOSTER IN THE CENTRE 
A LONG TURN OVER STROKE LET US SEE 
HOW HITS THE TURN CROATIA LEADING 
HE COULD WIN IT IT IS GOING TO BE 
DUJE DRAGANJA IT'S A NEW WORLD 
RECORD FOR DUJE DRAGANJA L. WAS 
WORRIED ABOUT HIM L. DID NOT THINK 
HE WOULD GO THAT FAST THE MASSIVE 
WORLD RECORD ON THE FIFTY METRES 
FREESTYLE THE SILVER I THINK IT 
HAS GONE TO FOSTER IT HAS TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE 
WHAT A SWIM FOR FOSTER IF YOU ARE 
GOING TO GET BEATEN GET BEAT BEEN 
BY A WORLD RECORD THAT WAS THE 
ONLY THING THAT WAS GOING TO BEAT 
HIM YOU CANNOT TAKE IT AWAY FROM 
DUJE DRAGANJA WE KNEW HE WAS THE 
THREAT BUT FOSTER TO MAKE A COME 
BACK AFTER HAVING A COUPLE OF YEARS 
OUT IT IS A GREAT RESULT TO GET A 
SILVER SO THE GOLD WENT TO CROATIA 
BUT THE SILVER MEDAL TO THE SILVER 
FOX A MAN TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO HE STARTED 
HIS CAREER HE IS THIRTY SEVEN HE WILL BE 
GOING TO HIS FIFTH OLYMPICS AND HE 
IS HERE WITH US NOW YOU HAVE 
ANOTHER FINAL TONIGHT 
YES I DID 
THAT LAST NIGHT AND IT WAS A WARM 
UP FOR THE FREESTYLE BUT THE SAME 
TIME I WANTED TO GET OUT THERE THIS 
EVENING BECAUSE THE ATMOSPHERE HAS 
BEEN FANTASTIC 
WHAT IS THE SECRET 
TO YOUR ETERNAL YOUTH LIFESTYLE LIFESTYLE ALL THE THINGS I HAVE LEARNED FTS 
IT WAS IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT THE 
TRAINING IT WAS WEIGHTS NUTRITION 
THE WHOLE THING PLAYED A PART L. 
THOUGHT THE TRAINING IS THE 
IMPORTANT PART BUT IT WHAT YOU PUT 
YOUR BODY MAKES A LOT OF DIFFERENCE 
SO WE WILL SEE MARK FOSTER RANGE 
THAT WILL MAKE YOU A MULTI 
MILLIONAIRE HIS SWIM IT ALL 
HAPPENS THAT IS JUST LIKE THE 
FASTEST THING HERE SO HOW TIGHT 
IS IT AND HOW GOOD IS HE STILL TO 
PUSH THESE GUYS 
HE IS SITTING 
HERE I THINK MARK YOU HAVE CHANGE 
AND WORKED ON YOUR STROKE YOU HAVE 
IMPROVED THAT A LOT AT YOUR AGE TO 
KEEP LOOKING AT IMPROVEMENT IS 
FANTASTIC I NOTICED THE RIGHT ARM 
IS DIFFERENT AND I THINK TO THINK 
ABOUT REVENTING AND STILL BE STRONG 
ENOUGH TO BE IN A TOP THREE IN THE 
WORLD IS PHENOMENAL 
THAT IS 
EXPERIENCE YOU GATHERED ALL THE 
YEAR AND THE DIVERSITY IN YOUR 
LIFE SWIMMING IS HUGE AND PROBABLY 
THE BIGGEST PART OF YOUR LIFE BUT 
THERE IS LOTS OF OTHER THINGIOUS DO 
IT IS NOT LIKE YOU ARE WHACKING UP 
AND DOWN A POOL EVERY DAY 
IS THAT 
THE THING THAT TIRES PEOPLE THE 
MOST THE GRIND 
I THINK SO WHEN I 
WAS YOUNGER I TRAINED WITH SARAH 
HARD CASTLE'S COACH AND I USED TO 
DO EIGHTY THOUSAND METRES A WEEK NOW I 
PROBABLY DO TEN FIFTEEN TOW THOUSAND A 
WEEK EVERYTHING I DO IS VERY FAST 
EVER I DID WAS VERY SLOW THE 
BOTTOM LINE I I NEED TO GO FAST L. 
CAN'T TRAIN THAT FAST AND DO SEVENTY THOUSAND 
METRES I WAS TALKING TO A LOT OF 
THE OTHER TOP SWIMMERS IT IS 
COMMONSENSE THE TECHNICAL STROKE 
USED TO BE GET OUT AS FAR AS 
POSSIBLE BUT YOU HAVE NO STRENGTH 
ALL YOUR STRENGTH COMES HERE SO THE 
IDEA IS TO GET YOUR ARM OVER AND 
PULL 
SO LIKE A PADDLE 
THE WAY YOU PULL PULL YOUR ARM SHOULD BE PULLING 
OVER THE TOP L. L. HAVE BEEN PLAYING 
ROUND WITH THAT IT IS GETTING 
BETTER 
BR YOU HAPPY WITH THE BETTER SILVER MEDAL THERE 
I WAS L. KNEW 
KENNY DALGLISH WOULD BE HAVE BEEN 
THE MAIN PERSON IF HE HAD BEEN 
NEXT TO ME HE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE SO 
FAST THE OUTSIGN LANE THE GUY 
THAT GOT THE BROPBGZ WAS IN LANE 
EIGHT THAT WAS WASN'T NO 
COINCIDENCE IT IS FASTER ON 
OUTSIDE AND THE SUIT HAS MADE A LOT 
OF DIFFERENCE NO BRAIN SCIENTIST 
TO LOOK THAT IS THE FASTST SUIT IN 
THE WORLD 
AND THAT IS YOUR FORTY SEVENTH 
MAJOR INTERNATIONAL MEDAL 
ABSOLUTELY 
HOPEFULLY GO FOR FIFTY AT ABSOLUTELY THE END OF THE YEAR POSSIBLY I WAS 
GOING TO ASK ABOUT THE OLYMPIC THE 
ONE THING MISSING FROM THAT GIANT 
BOX IS OF MEDALS IS AN OLYMPIC ONE 
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU AT THE 
OLYMPICS 
IT WAS A JOKE IT SOMEONE OLYMPICS OF THOSE THINGS THE WORLD CHAMPIONS 
LONG COURSE AND THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
THAT IS WHERE EVERYBODY IS YOU 
FIND OUT THE WORLD SHORT COURSE 
CHAMPIONSHIP CERTAIN EVENTS ARE 
WEAKER MY EVENT DUJE DRAGANJA WAS 
IN THERE THERE WAS A FEW GOOD GUYS 
IN THERE BUT YOU LOOK AT SOME OF 
THE EVENTS MEN'S BREASTSTROKE WAS 
PACK AND YOU LOOK AT OTHERS AND 
THEY ARE WEAKER SO OLYMPIC GAMES 
WORLD CHAMPIONS EVERYBODY IS THERE 
NO EXCUSES 
AND FINALS IN THE 
MORNINGS I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE NOT 
REALLY A MORNING MAN A BIT 
STRUGGLING TO GET OUT OF BED IT IT HAVE ALWAYS SAID IT IT TRUE WHAT 
HAPPENS I DO MY TRAINING IN THE 
AFTERNOON SO I AM WHEN EVER I AM 
TRAINING O. HARD OR RACING FAST IT 
IS IN THE AFTERNOON L. DON'T DO 
MORNING SESSIONS L. USED TO WHEN I 
WAS YOUNGER BUT IT IS ONE OF THESE 
SITUATIONS YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
DEAL WITH IT L. GET UP AND DO FAST 
STUFF IN THE MORNING AND CONDITION

THAT SHE HAD A LOT OF SUPPORTERS

MEDAL MEDAL ANOTHER EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WAS LINING UP 
FOR THE WOMEN'S TWO HUNDRED METRES

ANDY ELIZABETH SIMMONDS GOT A VERY 
GOOD START HOPEFULLY SHE HAS GOT 
SOMETHING OUT THE BACK END SHE IS 
GOING TO TRY FOR A MEDAL POSITION 
BUT COVENTRY IS GOING FOR THE WORLD

SHE HAS GONE VERY VERY RECORD FAST DOWN THIS ONE HUNDRED IF SHE KEEPS 
THIS GOING SHE WILL OBLITERATE THE 
WORLD RECORD MY GOODNESS ME SEVENTEEN 
THAT IS FIFTEEN AND THE WORLD RECORD 
PACE ELIZABETH SIMMONDS IS NOT FAR 
AWAY NOW SHE IS IN A PERFECT 
POSITION 
COVENTRY HAS DONE A LOT POSITION OF RACES SHE IS TALKING ABOUT 
BEING QUITE TIRED BUT I TELL YOU 
WHAT THIS IS NOT THE RACE FOR 
SOMEBODY WHO IS TIRED THE WORLD 
RECORD IS LIKELY TO BE BROKEN HERE 
ELIZABETH SIMMONDS IS NOT FAR OFF 
THAT WORLD RECORD AS WELL 
ELIZABETH SIMMONDS FROM GREAT 
BRITAIN IN LANE FIVE IS JUST AHEAD 
COVENTRY LEADING BY FOUR METRES 
LET US HOPE IT CUTS DOWN TO ONE 
METRE COVENTRY LOOKS SO STRONG 
ELIZABETH SIMMONDS HAS A SUPER TURN 
THEIR SHE HAS SET COMMONWEALTH 
RECORD IN THE HEATS THE WORLD

MINUTES OH NINE ONE A FANTASTIC SWIMMER

IT IS QUITE HARD TO CALL SOMETIMES 
YOU KNOW FROM THE BEGINNING OF 
TWO HUNDRED METRE RACE WHERE IT IS THEY 
NEED TO GO BUT OFTEN THE RACE 
EVOLVES WHERE IT IS GOING TO GO 
IT LOOKS LIKE HILLCREST IS MAKING 
THE MOVE NOW L. THINK HE IS AND A 
GREAT POSITION TO WIN THIS DIEHL 
CREST GILL CREST CHRIS GAYLE 
CREST BORYSIK OF THE UKRAINE HE HAS 
ALREADY WON THE ONE HUNDRED METRE 
BREASTSTROKE LOOK AT THAT TURN A 
SUPER TURN HOLD ON THE LAST TEN 
METRES IT IS GOING TO BE BORYSIK 
AGAINST CHRIS HE HAS GOT IT HE IS 
THE WORLD CHAMPION HE TIME THAT 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY 
WHAT A 
FANTASTIC SWIMMER TIME TO THAT 
THIRTY ONE HUNDREDTHS OF A SECOND IT DOES 
NOT TAKE MUCH THERE THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDREDTH OF A SECOND HIS COACH SAID THAT IS WHAT HE 
WANTED TO DO AND HE DID IT EXACTLY 
TO ORDER 
ABSOLUTELY YOU DON'T WIN 
RACES LIKE THIS WITHOUT PLANNING 
THEM THE HAD A CONVERSATION HOW 
YOU GOING TO PACE IT WELL I KNOW 
I AM NOT THE FASTEST IN THE 
RACE I 
WILL SIT THERE AND MAKE SURE I AM 
THERE OR THEREABOUTS THAT LAST 
TERM YOU SAID IT THAT WAS 
FANTASTIC YOUR LUNGS ARE BURSTING 
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GO UNDER 
WATER HERE IT IS THEIR LAST TERM 
A BIG KICK THAT WAS A BIG KICK HE 
COMES TO THE SURFACE AS I SAID AT 
THAT POINT YOUR LUNGS ARE BURSTING 
BORYSIK IS A VERY STRONG SWIMMER 
HIS MOUTH IS SO WIDE OPEN GASPING 
FOR OXYGEN LUCKILY HE GET THE 
TIMING RIGHT AT THE END 
I THOUGHT 
BORYSIK GOT IT HE DID NOT THOUGH 
LOOK LOOK BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE NICK GILLINGHAM ONE 
THAT BACK THEN HE WON THAT RACE 
BACK THEN 
MOVING TO THE MEN'S FOUR HUNDRED METRE 
FREESTYLE PRILUKOV FROM RUSSIA IN 
LANE ONE WHO WON THIS EVENT THE 
LAST TWO TIMES IT WAS STAGED IN 
MINNEAPOLIS AND IN CHINA ROBBIE 
RENNIE AND DAVID CARRY FOR GREAT 
BRITAIN RENWICK 
THIS IS FASCINATING PRILUKOV HAS 
WON THE LAST TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED METRE FREESTYLE 
RACES SHE HAS WON THE LAST TWO 
RACES IN THIS CATEGORY DON'T 
NORMALLY SEE HIM SWIMMING LIKE THIS 
HE IS NORMALLY A LITTLE BIT SLOWER 
IN THE FIRST HALF HE LOOKED SO 
GOOD OFF THE WALLS HE WORKED SO 
HARD 
I THINK THE ITALIAN IS HARD SHOCKED BY THIS HE MIGHT HAVE 
THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE IT HIS WAY 
THAT IS HIS USUAL TACTIC PRETTY 
SURPRISING YOU CAN SEE HIM 
THINKING I WONDER IF I HAVE LET 
PRILUKOV GET AWAY WITH THIS 
PRILUKOV IS A BIG BOY HE HAS SEEN 
OPEN WATER THE TWO BRITS IN THIRD 
AND FOURTH IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE 
ONE MEDAL BETWEEN THEM ANDY FOSTER 
THIS IS VERY GOOD SWIMMING 
PRILUKOV IS STILL BLEEDING IT 
LOOKS LIKE ROBBIE RENWICK IS COMING 
BACK HE HAS TWO LANES DOWN ONE 
LANE UP FROM THE ITALIAN IT IS 
PRILUKOV AT THE MOMENT LEADING IT 
LOOKS LIKE ROBBIE RENWICK UP THERE 
IN LANE THREE IS THIRD AND DAVID 
CARRY IN FOURTH POSITION IT IS GOING 
TO BE A REAL SPRINT DOWN THIS IS 
GOING TO BE SO TIGHT IN 
THIS LAST 
FIFTY METRES LOOK AT THIS PRILUKOV 
IS 
GOING TO 
GO THREE IN ROW I 
THINK THIS IS REAL MASTER CLASS 
HE IS SWIMMING AWAY FROM THE FIELD 
PRILUKOV IS GOING 
TO WIN 
THE GOLD 
HE IS GOING TO BE THE WORLD 
CHAMPION THREE ME THREE IN A ROW 
A NEW EUROPEAN RECORD FOR PRILUKOV 
THE SILVER GOES TO THE ITALIAN AND 
GREAT BRITAIN'S ROBERT RENWICK GETS 
A BRONZE MEDAL WHAT SWIM FROM 
HIM AND A MASSIVE BRITISH RECORD 
WHAT A STUNNING SWIM 
WELL HE HAS 
JUST TAKEN ALMOST TWO AND ONE HALF SECONDS OF 
HIS TIME THIS MORNING PRILUKOV 
THOUGH DOMINIC NO CHANCE HE WENT 
FOR IT FROM THE WORD GO DOMINANT 
ROBBIE RENWICK MUST BE REALLY 
PLEASED WITH THAT 
GOLD THEN TO RUSSIA FOR PRILUKOV 
FOR THE THIRD CHAMPIONSHIPS RUNNING 
RUGBY RENWICK PAID PLENTY OF 
TRIBUTE TO HIS COACH AFTER THAT 
RACE DAVID CARRY JUST MISSED OUT 
ON A MEDAL

FOURTH POSITION REALLY A BATTLE

CHAMPIONSHIPS WITH TWO MEDALS MORE RELAY ACTION NOW IN THEIR WOMEN'S FOUR BY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY REDLY MEDLEY GREAT BRITAIN ARE IN FIVE THE 
STARTER HAD HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THEY 
WERE STILL AND HE HAD TO WAIT 
LONGER THAN USUAL FIFTY METRES 
UNDERWATER THEY ARE ALLOWED AND THE 
USE MOST OF IT LIZZIE SIMMONDS IS 
ON THE TWO HUNDRED BACKSTROKE SHE IS FIRST 
FOR GREAT BRITAIN IN FIVE GREAT BRITAIN TURNS SECOND 
AUSTRALIA IN FIRST PLACE SECOND IS 
CRITICAL 
LIZZIE SIMMONDS HAS GOT CRITICAL THE STAMINA OVER TWO HUNDRED METRES AND I 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER GETTING THE 
LEAD HERE TO GIVE TO KATE HAYWOOD 
YOU CAN SET BRITISH RECORD OF THE 
FIRST LEG AND LIZZIE SIMMONDS LOOKS 
GOOD A NEW BRITISH RECORD A GREAT 
SWIMMER WHAT A LEAD OF THE 
PRESSURE IS ON THE LEADER OF SUMMER 
PAZ AND LIZZIE SIMMONDS VISIT TO 
THE OCCASION WHAT IS STARRED FOR 
THE BRITISH TEAM GREAT BRITAIN IS 
IN FIRST PLACE OR AUSTRALIA IS A 
SECOND 
JESSICA HARDY AT 
THE TOP OF SECOND THE PICTURE THERE IS KATE HAYWOOD 
A GREAT FALL EXPECT HARDY TO GIVE 
A GREAT READ SHE WILL BE HANDING 
OVER TO RACHEL KOMISARZ JEMMA LOWE 
IS NOW IN THIRD PLACE 
THE RUSSIANS 
IS NOW ON THE SHOULDER OF KATE 
HAYWOOD EFIMOVA HAS SWUM AN 
ABSOLUTE BLINDER THERE JESSICA 
HARDY LEADING FOR AMERICA SHE IS 
GOING TO BE HANDING OVER TO RACHEL 
KOMISARZ A GOOD TAKEOVER 
AUSTRALIA A VERY QUICK TAKE OVER 
THERE WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL 
THE END BUT THAT LOOKED 
EXTRAORDINARILY CLOSE 
I DIDN'T 
LOOK AT THAT L. WAS LOOKING AT THE 
AMERICAN SPLIT WHICH IS ALMOST A 
SECOND AND THE WORLD RECORD PACE 
IT IS GOING PRETTY QUICK THE 
AUSTRALIANS ARE DOING WELL THAT OF 
THE AUSTRALIANS WE HAVE GOT SOME 
WORK TO DO NOW JEMMA LOWE IN A 
DEFINITE THIRD POSITION THE 
RUSSIANS HAVE NOW DROPPED OFF IT IT IS U. S. A. LEADING AUSTRALIA SECOND 
GREAT BRITAIN THE THIRD AT THE 
MOMENT WITH ONE LEG TO GO FRAN 
HALSALL STILL TO GO WHAT A BIG JOB 
SHE HAS GOT TO DO IT IF WE ARE 
GOING TO REMOVE GOING TO WIN THE 
GOLD MEDAL IT MIGHT BE TOO MUCH AT 
THE MOMENT AMERICA IS WELL KNOWN 
THE WORLD RECORD PACE WELL UNDER 
THE WORLD RECORD PACE IT AN AWFUL 
LOT TO DO FOR FRAN HALSALL SHE IS 
ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN METRES BEHIND 
AMERICA IS THE FIRST PLACE 
AUSTRALIA IS IN SECOND PLACE AND 
GREAT BRITAIN IS A THIRD ALICE 
MILLS IS READY QUIP 
FRAN HALSALL 
IS CAUGHT IN NO MAN'S LAND HERE 
SHE IS GOING TO GET THE BRONZE 
MEDAL HERE YOU ARE RIGHT ALICE 
MILES WAS A FANTASTIC BATTLE 
RILLS COMING INTO THE TURNER VERY 
STRONGLY FRAN HALSALL IS STILL 
COMFORTABLY IN BRONZE MEDAL 
POSITION AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL 
BE A BRONZE BARRING ANY 
DISQUALIFICATIONS HE WAS TAKEN AS 
IT DID TAKE THE GOLD MEDAL HERE 
THE TIME A NEW WORLD RECORD U. S. A. 
GET THE GOLD AUSTRALIA AT THE 
SILVER GREAT BRITAIN THE BRONZE 
ANOTHER WORLD RECORD AT THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIPS ABSOLUTELY SUPER 
STUFF AND THE BRITISH RECORD 
ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED BUT COLD METAL IN A GREAT THAT 
GOLD MEDAL IN A WORLD RECORD TIME 
YOU COULD SEE THAT GREAT BRITAIN 
ARE IN THIRD PLACE IN THE MEDAL 
HAUL THE BIGGEST HAUL THEY HAVE 
PREVIOUSLY EVER HAD WAS THIRTEEN MEDALS 
SO THEY ARE AHEAD OF THAT WITH 
THREE DAYS TO GO 
HOW EXCITED SHOULD WE GET ABOUT AS 
PERFORMERS FROM THE BRITISH TEAM I I THINK WE CAN GET EXCITED BECAUSE 
THEY ARE TRANSLATING THEIR FALL 
FROM LAST WEEKEND CARRIED IT 
FORWARD THIS IS A SHORT COURSE AND 
THERE ARE TEAMS WHICH ON THE SALE 
BUT THE CONFIDENCE THEY WILL GET 
FROM THIS IS GOOD THEY ARE ALSO 
RACING WHICH IS IMPORTANT THAT IS 
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IT THIS SUMMER 
BUT I THINK IT IS ABOUT DEPTH OF 
SIMMERS SOME RACES HAVE GOT GREAT 
FIELDS AND SOME THEY ARE LIGHT SIXTY 
MEDALS AS GOOD BUT WE WILL NOT GET 
SIXTY MEDALS AT THE OLYMPICS OUR 
MEDALS WERE SPREAD AMONGST TWELVE 
INDIVIDUALS AND SO THAT IS WHAT IS 
REALLY EXCITING THERE ARE LOTS OF 
KIDS WHICH AREN'T GETTING UP AT 
RAISING HARD 
THEY GREAT RANGE OF 
A GREAT AGE RANGE AS WELL VICTIMS VICTIMS ARE PREDICTING LEVELS FOR BEIJING 
A DANGEROUS THING TO DO WHAT WOULD 
BE A REALISTIC TELLY 
I THINK IT IS 
DANGEROUS WE HAVE HAD TWOS AND 
THREES IN THE LAST TWO OLYMPICS BUT 
I WOULD LIKE TO GET FIVES AND SIXES 
WE WERE TALKING EARLIER AND WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT BUILDING BLOCKS WHICH 
NEEDED TO BE PUT IN PLACE TO CREATE 
SUCCESS BUT EXCITED ABOUT LOTS AND 
LOTS OF SOME AS GETTING INTO FINALS 
HAVE THEY ALL SAID THAT I THINK WE 
WILL DO BETTER THIS TIME THAN THEY 
HAVE DONE FOR QUITE WHILE THERE 
ARE STRONG BUNCH OF SUMMERS AND 
IT IS GREAT TEAM THERE IS A 
LOVELY ATMOSPHERE AMONGST THE OLD 
AND THE STRENGTH THAT THEY CAN TAKE 
INTO THE GAMES IS CONFIDENT LILLE 
THE LIAM TANCOCK IS GOOD 
EXAMPLE OF THAT HE COULD GET 
ANOTHER GOLD MEDAL TONIGHT 
IN A 
WORLD RECORD SO MICHAEL COULD BE 
LOSING HIS HAIR 
HE WAS SETTING 
VERY FAST TIMES THIS MORNING HE HE HAS GOT THE INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY AS 
WELL 
IT IS THE BACKSTROKE WE WELL ARE LOOKING AT REALLY 
WHO ELSE 
TONIGHT HANNAH MILEY BROKE THE 
BRITISH RECORD THIS MORNING SHE 
PICKED UP A SILVER MEDAL EARLIER IN 
THE WEEK SHE WENT UNDERNEATH THE 
WORLD RECORD TIME SHE IS ABOUT FIFTY 
WHILE KILOGRAMS SHE IS COACHED BY 
HER DAD BRINGS BACK MEMORIES FOR 
ME 
SHE IS ALWAYS SMILING THERE IS ME A THING OF THERE LET'S TAKE YOU 
THROUGH THE LINE UP TONIGHT IT IS A 
FINALS IN TERMS OF FINALS

GOING TO BE SPOTLIGHTS AND MUSIC 
WE WILL BE LIVE HERE FROM THE 
ARENA IN MANCHESTER HAD FOR THIRTY FIVE 
OVER NOW TO THE RUGBY AT TWICKENHAM 
FINALS FOR BIG CLUBS AND SMALL 
FANS AND TEAMS FROM THE NORTH WEST
