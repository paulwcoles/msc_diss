THANK YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
THANK YOU SO MUCH 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
THE TARGET FOR TODAY THE HOMES OF TWO CELEBRITY HOME OWNERS ABOUT TO RECEIVE THE KEYHOLE TREATMENT 
FROM OUR INTREPID INVESTIGATOR LISA SNOWDON WHO'S WAITING NOW TO TELL US WHAT'S IN STORE 
IF HELEN WAS THE FACE THAT LAUNCHED ONE THOUSAND SHIPS SURELY THIS WAS THE FACE THAT LAUNCHED A MILLION SLIPS 
IT'S MODEL BEHAVIOUR AND EVERYTHING'S SUPER 
I HAVE TO BE VERY DIPLOMATIC WHEN VISITING PEOPLE'S HOMES 
I CAN'T BE CHEEKY 
SHOULD BE POLITICALLY CORRECT AND ALWAYS HAVE LIBERAL VIEWS 
THE CLUES ARE ALL THERE BUT WHO'S PLAYING THE GAME TODAY 
WHO'S PLAYING THE GAME TODAY 
IT'S OUR PANEL AND WHAT A PANEL 
THEY ARE 
THEY'RE LIKE HAMSTERS 
CUTE CUDDLY BUT ALWAYS RUNNING AROUND IN CIRCLES 
OUR FIRST PANELLIST THOUGHT ABOUT BECOMING A WRITER ON HISTORY 
UNTIL SHE REALISED THERE WAS NO FUTURE IN IT 
AAH 
THE NAME'S BOND JENNIE BOND 
A LEGENDARY BALLROOM DANCER OUR NEXT PANELLIST WAS SACKED FROM 
HIS FIRST JOB WITH THE FORMATION HOKEY COKEY TEAM OF SOUTHAMPTON 
WHEN INSTEAD OF PUTTING HIS WHOLE SELF IN HE WAVED IT ALL ABOUT 
IT'S ANTON DU BEKE 
OUR THIRD PANELLIST WAS ONCE A PRESENTER OF DISNEY CLUB 
SHE WAS NEVER GRUMPY NEVER GOOFY 
TOO TALL TO BE MINNIE AND TOO BEAUTIFUL TO BE ANYONE OTHER THAN JENNY POWELL AAW THAT'S 
I GOT AWAY WITH A NICE ONE THERE AAW 
SO ON TO THE GAME THEN 
WITH THE HELP OF OUR MAGIC KEYS OUR LOVELY LIVELY HOUSE DETECTIVE 
LISA SNOWDEN WILL MAKE A FORENSIC EXAMINATION OF HOUSES BELONGING TO TWO FAMOUS CELEBRITIES 
WITH THE EVIDENCE SHE PROVIDES PLUS A BIT OF HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS IN THE STUDIO AUDIENCE 
ALL OUR PANEL HAVE TO DO IS JUST TO WORK OUT WHOSE HOMES THEY ARE 
SO LET'S JOIN LISA AT HOUSE NUMBER ONE AND WATCH CLOSELY BECAUSE REMEMBER 
THE CLUES ARE THERE AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
I'M IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE AND EVEN ON THIS MISTY AUTUMN MORNING 
THIS IS THE MOST ROMANTIC SETTING I THINK YOU COULD EVER FIND IN ENGLAND 
BUT BEFORE YOU EVEN ENTER THE HOUSE 
THIS DECKING AND THE FURNISHINGS ON IT MAKE A POSITIVE STATEMENT 
THERE'S A PERFECT DYNAMIC ABOUT THIS 
ISN'T THIS A FABULOUS SPACE 
I CAN'T THINK OF ENOUGH ADJECTIVES TO DESCRIBE IT 
AND IF I STARTED IT WOULD PROBABLY TURN INTO A MONOLOGUE 
BEAUTIFUL 
PANACHE IS A GOOD WORD THIS PERSON LIKES TO DO THINGS WITH BAGS OF IT 
BUT WHILST IT'S A SEXY PLACE IT'S OBVIOUSLY A WELL LIVED IN HOME 
I LIKE THE SIZE OF EVERYTHING HUGE COMFY SOFAS 
BEAUTIFULLY BECUSHIONED WITH THROWS CASUALLY DRAPED OVER THEM 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THIS HAS ALL HAPPENED THROUGH A HAPPY ACCIDENT BUT I CAN TELL YOU 
THIS PERSON IS AN EXPERT WHEN IT COMES TO DRESSING THINGS PROPERLY 
I JUST LOVE THE MIXTURE OF OLD AND NEW 
THIS BASKET OF PEBBLES WOULDN'T NORMALLY STRIKE ME AS ORNAMENTAL 
BUT SET AGAINST THESE BATTERED PIECES OF LUGGAGE IT WORKS REALLY WELL 
THIS LARGE COFFEE TABLE EDITION OF MAGNUM WITH SOME OF THE WORLD'S BEST PHOTOGRAPHS IN IT 
STYLE JUST POURS OUT OF THIS BEDROOM WITH THIS FABULOUS STEEL CHAIR 
WITH ROSES CUT OUT OF IT 
IT MIGHT NOT BE TOO COMFY 
IF YOU'VE JUST GOT OUT OF THE BATH BUT THIS IS VERY INTERESTING 
HOW MANY BEDROOMS HAVE GRAFITTI ON THE WALL 
LOOKS LIKE BANKSY'S BEEN HERE VERY COOL 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A LIGHT HAVE A BIG ONE 
THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMEONE WHO'S USED TO THE LIMELIGHT 
I'M READY FOR MY CLOSE UP MR. DEMILLE 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN ITEMS OF 
LADIES' APPAREL BEEN LEFT LYING AROUND 
I'M SAYING NOTHING I'LL LEAVE YOU TO HAVE A LOOK 
I KNOW THEY'RE FAIRLY NEW TO THIS MAGNIFICENT HOME AND HAVEN'T HAD 
TIME TO HANG EVERYTHING BUT A FEW INTERESTING POSTERS 
WAITING TO TAKE PRIDE OF PLACE IS THIS POSTER FROM THE MUSICAL RENT 
I DON'T THINK RENT IS A PROBLEM HERE 
THIS IS A PERSON WHO'S VERY SUCCESSFUL INTERNATIONALLY 
CANNY AND CLEVER AND CERTAINLY MORE THAN JUST A PRETTY FACE 
I BELIEVE THIS PERSON IS A BIT OF A DEEP THINKER IF THESE BOOKS ARE ANYTHING TO GO BY 
THE MIRACLE OF WATER 
LOOK AT THIS THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING 
THESE WERE TAKEN FROM WATER FROZEN WHEN PLACED IN 
FOUR DIFFERENT GLASS CONTAINERS WITH THE WORDS TAPED TO THE SIDES 
EXHILARATION DREAM PEACE LOVE AND GRATITUDE SO CLEVER 
WE ALSO HAVE DEEPAK CHOPRA THE PATH TO LOVE 
THE HOUSE OF KLEIN THAT'S MR. CALVIN KLEIN TO YOU AND I 
AND A HUGE BOOK ON NATURAL HEALING 
BUT IF READING IS JUST TOO HARD 
THEN YOU COULD STARE OUT AT THE LAKE FOR HOURS 
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN 
LUXURY LINGERIE RENT AND THE BIG POND 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LISA 
NOW FOR OUR STUDIO AUDIENCE AND YOU AT HOME BUT NOT FOR OUR PANEL 
HERE'S WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
JENNIE WE COME TO YOU WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE HOME 
I WANT TO LIVE THERE FIRST OF ALL IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS 
OBVIOUSLY THE LINGERIE MIGHT BE A BIT OF A GIVEAWAY 
A. N. N. SUMMERS DO YOU RECKON NO

WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE HOUSE ANTON UM 
LINGERIE THAT'S ALL 
THAT WAS IT THAT WAS IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
UM IT'S IT'S VERY STYLISH 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A LADY IT'S OBVIOUSLY A FEMALE 
I WAS INTERESTED BY A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT LISA SAID WAS SHE MADE REFERENCE TO A MONOLOGUE 
WHICH MADE ME THINK IT WAS SOMEBODY WHO HAS MAYBE 
MODELLED LINGERIE AS OPPOSED TO DESIGNED LINGERIE 
SHUT UP I'M ON A ROLL DON'T STOP ME 
I THINK BOTH WOULD PROBABLY BE TRUE JENNY OH O. K. 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY MODELLED BUT THEY CERTAINLY COULD MODEL 
SOMEONE WHO 
I GET THE FEELING FROM THE PROPERTY THAT SOMEBODY WHO'S QUITE YOUNG 
YOUNG AND FLIRTY 
FLIRTY IF YOU'RE HANGING YOUR KNICKERS AROUND THE PLACE 
YOU MUST BE QUITE FLIRTY OR JUST A BIT MESSY YEAH 
HAVE THEY BEEN A PERFORMER IN THE WEST END 
THEY HAVE HAVE THEY THEY HAVE 
HAVE THEY PERFORMED OBVIOUSLY ACROSS THE BIG POND 
YEAH HAVE THEY GONE THE OTHER SIDE 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE'S PERFORMED OVER THERE 
SHE HAILS ORIGINALLY FROM THERE BUT I DON'T KNOW 
O. K. RIGHT HANG ON A SECOND GET RID OF THAT THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION 
JENNIE 
WE HAVE A YOUNG ATTRACTIVE AMERICAN LINGERIE LINGERIE 
OH MODEL DESIGNER I'VE GOT AN IDEA 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU GOT FROM MONOLOGUE TO THE FACT SHE MIGHT MODEL 
I TELL YOU WHAT 
I'M AN ENIGMA YOU ARE 
EVEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND ME SOMETIMES 
WE GOT THERE THAT'S THE MAIN POINT DO ANY OF YOU KNOW ABOUT RENT 
YEAH YES I NEVER USED TO PAY IT 
GOT EVICTED FOUR TIMES IT WAS A NIGHTMARE 
THERE'S BEEN A FEW CELEBRITIES I TELL YOU 
CAN I ASK A QUESTION IS SHE BLONDE YES 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'VE NO IDEA I THINK IT'S GOTTA BE A MODEL 
SHE'S MOSTLY A MODEL IS SHE YEAH MOSTLY A MODEL 
O. K. YOU CAN ZOOM IN ON THE BASIS THERE YOU'VE GOT THE BASIC PLOT THERE 
WHO IS IT IS SHE VERY ATTRACTIVE 
YEAH GOT A FABULOUS FIGURE 
SHE'S A MODEL WELL YOU KNOW AND SHE'S GOT HER OWN LINE OF LINGERIE 
HAS SHE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YEAH 
SHE HAS WHAT DO YOU THINK WHO'S GOING TO GO FOR IT 
I THINK JENNY SHOULD COS I'M NOT REALLY SURE 
I THINK IT'S CAPRICE YOU'RE RIGHT 
IT'S CAPRICE 
SO CAPRICE WILL YOU COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
LOVELY TO SEE YOU 
FANTASTIC THANK YOU WELL DONE 
WELL DONE YEAH THAT WAS SO FAST 
THEY LOVED THE HOUSE DIDN'T YOU 
LOVED THE HOUSE YEAH WHAT A HOUSE THANK YOU 
IT'S A REALLY SPECIAL PLACE 
YOU DON'T REALLY FIND ANYTHING LIKE THAT HERE THAT'S FOR SURE IN ENGLAND THANK YOU 
DO YOU DIVE IN THE WATER THERE 
NOT NOW IT'S TOO DARN COLD BUT DEFINITELY IN THE SUMMERTIME 
IT'S LOVELY AND THERE'S SWANS AND DUCKS AND IT'S REALLY REALLY A SPECIAL PLACE 
THE PANEL GLOMMED ON TO IT 
PARTICULARLY WHEN THE THING CAME IN ABOUT HAILING FROM AMERICA 
AT WHAT AGE WERE YOU WHEN YOU HAILED FROM AMERICA 
OH GOSH I FEEL LIKE I'M MORE EUROPEAN NOW 
I GOT HERE ELEVEN YEARS GOSH I'VE BEEN HERE ELEVEN YEARS NOW 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
I THINK THIS IS WHERE I'M GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE GOOD 
I LOVE IT I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK IN SOUTH AFRICA AS WELL BUT WHAT I AM DOING NOW IS THE LINGERIE 
IT'S MOSTLY HERE I STARTED IT HERE 
I STILL GO BACK TO AMERICA A LITTLE BIT SOUTH AFRICA GERMANY 
THE LINGERIE THAT WE SAW WAS WORK RATHER THAN PLEASURE 
I KNOW EVERYONE IT STARTED OUT AS I WAS A LINGERIE MODEL 
I DID A LICENSE DEAL WITH THE COMPANY AND I THOUGHT MY GOODNESS ARE THEY MAKING THE CASH'ALL OR WHAT 
SO I KIND OF TAUGHT MYSELF THE INS AND OUTS 
FOR THREE YEARS AND THEN BOUGHT BACK MY LICENSE THREE YEARS AGO NOW 
SO FINALLY I'M WORKING NOW 
I'M WORKING TWELVE HOUR DAYS I THOUGHT ENTERTAINMENT WAS HARD THAT IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THIS 
YOU'RE RIGHT IN THERE DEALING WITH THE DESIGNS AND ALL OF THAT 
EVERYTHING ALL THE LOGISTICALS THE FACTORIES THE MARGINS THE CASH FLOWS THE TECHNICAL SIDE 
AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN YOU'RE THRUSTING THE MAJORITY OF YOUR MONEY 
AND YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE BILLS YOU HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT KIND OF INSPIRATION 
AND IT IS ALL YOUR MONEY 
IT'S MY MONEY I DON'T HAVE ANY INVESTORS I DID THIS ON MY OWN 
SO YOU ALSO GET ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF THE PROFITS AS WELL AS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
YES NOW I'M REAPING THE REWARDS THE FIRST FEW YEARS I WAS A BIT WORRIED 
I THOUGHT WAS THIS THE WRONG IDEA 
WAS THIS A STUPID IDEA 
NOW IT'S REALLY PAYING OFF 
IT'S SO REWARDING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON 
A MODEL HAS A SHORT SHELF LIFE YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THAT 
NOW I'VE STARTED THIS COMPANY I'M DOING THE LINGERIE I JUST LAUNCHED THE SWIM 
I'M DOING OCCASION WEAR I'M DOING PERFUME I'M DOING NIGHT WEAR 
SO THANK GOD IT'S GOING REALLY WELL 
YOU PICK AND CHOOSE AND DO SOME MODELLING DO YOU DO ALL YOUR MODELLING NOW FOR YOUR OWN PRODUCTS 
MY BABE THINGS HAVE NOT GONE BAD YET I DO ALL THE MODELLING MYSELF YEAH 
IF IT DOES GO BAD I CAN JUST RETOUCH IT SO 
SO IT'S ALL GOOD IF YOU NEED A HAND WITH THE TOUCHING 
I'LL DO IT I'M GLAD TO HELP THAT'S SO SWEET MY PLEASURE ENTIRELY 
I'VE GOT VERY SOFT HANDS YOU'LL BE FINE 
WHEN YOU WERE DOING THAT MODEL LOOK EARLIER ON WHEN YOU WERE GUESSING AWAY IT LOOKED VERY ELEGANT 
YEAH I HAVE A SWAGGER ABOUT ME IN A MODELLISTIC STYLE 
YOU WOULD BE PERFECT TO MODEL WOMEN'S UNDERWEAR I THINK SO OOH I LOVE THAT 
I'LL HAVE A WAX DOWN IT'LL BE FINE A TWIST FOR YOU CAPRICE 
WHATEVER FLOATS YOUR BOAT IT'S GOOD 
IF IT HELPS WITH THE MARGINS I'M YOUR MAN OH I LOVE HIM GREAT 
THEN WE SAW RENT YOU DID THAT S. R. O. AS THEY SAY IN VARIETY FOR THREE MONTHS 
YES IN THE WEST END IN THE WEST END 
I'LL NEVER FORGET GOSH I WANTED 
ACTUALLY THE FIRST NIGHT I ALMOST PEED MY PANTS I WAS SO NERVOUS 
I WAS SO NERVOUS BECAUSE THE AUDIENCE WAS FULL OF JOURNALISTS 
OF COURSE THEY WANTED TO ABSOLUTELY SLASH ME A MODEL DOING A CREDIBLE PRODUCTION LIKE RENT 
AND I WAS PLAYING THE LEAD AND I WAS REALLY NERVOUS BUT THE REVIEWS THANK GOD WERE REALLY GOOD 
YEAH REALLY GOOD THEY WERE YOU MENTIONED THE PRESS THAT'S AN INTERESTING 
YOU TAKE A RATHER 
THINGS I'VE READ REALISTIC ATTITUDE IN THE SENSE THAT OF COURSE THERE'S INTRUSION INTO PRIVACY 
BUT BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SIGNING ON FOR IF YOU GO INTO THIS BUSINESS YEAH 
AT THE END OF THE DAY IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU COULD GO INTO HIBERNATION 
AND THEY'LL FORGET ABOUT YOU AND THEY WILL THEY'RE THAT RUTHLESS 
AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S MADE ME I'M FROM A NORMAL MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY 
NOW MOST OF MY FAMILY DON'T HAVE PASSPORTS 
AND I LIVE THIS UNBELIEVABLE LIFE AND MOST OF IT IS THANKS TO THE PRESS 
IT'S WHAT THRUSTED ME INTO THE LIMELIGHT 
IT'S WHAT'S MADE ME MY MONEY AND HELPED ME TO GET TO WHERE I'M AT TODAY 
SO THAT'S THE PRICE YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO PAY AND NOT WHINGE ABOUT IT 
WELL NO SOMETIMES I DO WHINGE ABOUT IT YEAH WHY NOT 
WHY NOT IT MAKES GOOD PRESS RIGHT YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BUT I MEAN NOT ALL FROM WHAT I READ NOT ALL THE STORIES ABOUT 
WHO YOU'RE ROMANTICALLY LINKED WITH HAVE AN IOTA OF TRUTH 
CAN I TELL YOU SOME OF THEM I HAVEN'T EVEN MET YET 
I GUESS WHATEVER SELLS THEY'LL CHUCK IT ON THE FRONT PAGE 
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REALLY HURTFUL STORIES THAT WEREN'T TRUE THAT DID BOTHER ME 
BUT AS TIME PROGRESSES YOU KIND OF DEVELOP A THICK SKIN 
AND YOU JUST SAY EVERYONE WILL FORGET A WEEK LATER THEY REALLY DO 
YEAH SO YOU TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD IT'S ALL GOOD 
AND THE ARTICLE THAT SAYS CHUBBY FRED PERKINS IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST GENIUS THAT THE WORD HAS EVER SEEN 
EVERYBODY READS THAT FANTASTIC FOR CHUBBY FRED PERKINS 
HE IS THE GREATEST THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN 
BUT ALL HE SEES IS THE WORD CHUBBY EXACTLY 
CAN I TELL YOU YOU ARE SO TRUE 
IT'S SO TRUE IT REALLY IS 
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S A VERY BLESSED AND A PRIVILEGED LIFE I HAVE TO SAY 
WELL YOU'VE EARNT IT 
I'M SO EXCITED I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS THIS IS THE MAGIC MOMENT 
HERE IT IS COMING YOUR WAY NOW THE THROUGH THE KEYHOLE KEY 
THAT SAYS IT'S BEEN GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US 
AW THANK YOU CAPRICE 
WELL DONE YOU GUYS 
I WON'T SELL IT ON EBAY TOO I'M KEEPING THIS 
I WONDER WHAT IT WOULD BE WORTH 
A BEAUTIFUL BUSINESS EXECUTIVE CAPRICE 
NOW LET'S JOIN LISA AT HOUSE NUMBER TWO 
REMEMBER THE CLUES ARE THERE AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
NOW I'M IN LONDON WATERLOO TO BE PRECISE 
WHICH IS HANDY FOR WESTMINSTER THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT 
FOR A STROLL DOWN THE SOUTH BANK MAYBE EVEN A RIDE ON THE LONDON EYE 
YOU SEE I'VE JUST COME THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR 
AND ALREADY I'M BEING LIBERAL WITH THE CLUES 
THIS IS A LONDON HIDEAWAY THAT'S MY FIRST IMPRESSION 
THIS IS SOMEWHERE TO COME AFTER A HARD DAY IN THE PUBLIC EYE 
SOMEWHERE TO REST AND UNWIND 
PROVIDING OF COURSE THERE'S ENOUGH TIME LEFT TO DO THAT 
LOOK AT THIS FABULOUS PICTURE OF THE CRAB NEBULA 
A DYNAMIC SPLASH OF ORANGE A HUGE EXPLOSION OF ENERGY 
IT CERTAINLY TYPIFIES THIS PERSON 
THE INTEREST IN ASTRONOMY CONTINUES ON WITH THE LITERATURE 
IT SEEMS TO POINT TO DISASTER 
STILL YOU MUST BE STRONG IN YOUR BELIEFS 
NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY ELSE THINKS 
IT'S A GAME PLAYER IN THIS FLAT THEY ARE A THINKER 
THEY HAVE A STRONG INTEREST IN STRATEGY WITH THE CHESS HERE 
AND WORDS ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM 
BUT ARE THEY CLEVER WITH THEM OR DO THEY THINK ABOUT THEM 
ISN'T IT CHEATING TO USE A DICTIONARY 
OR TWO DICTIONARIES ONE IN ENGLISH ONE IN ENGLISH ROMANIAN 
AND INTERESTING WORDS HERE LIKE OBRAZNICIE OBRAZNICIE 
WHICH MEANS CHEEKY 
THAT'S GOT TO BE A DOUBLE WORD SCORE 
SO IS THIS A CHECKMATE 
THEY'RE GOOD WITH WORDS 
AND A FAVOURITE BOOK OF REPORTAGE SITS ALONGSIDE MODERN DICTATORS 
A LITTLE AFTER DINNER SPEAKING 
FOLLOWED BY AGENDAS FROM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
IS THAT POLITICALLY CORRECT 
THIS IS A BOY'S KITCHEN SO THERE WILL BE BEER IN THE FRIDGE 
AND NO HEALTHY GREEN STUFF 
SO NO CLUES HERE BUT AT LEAST NOW YOU KNOW IT'S A BLOKE 
AND A BOY'S BEDROOM OR SHOULD I SAY MAN 
WELL THEY LIKE THEIR BIKES 
GOT SOME MOTORCYCLE GEAR AND BOOKS 
AND THEY'VE DRIVEN IN THE WELSH NATIONAL RALLY 
OR HAVE THEIR OWN PLANE 
LOOK 
SO IS THIS A HIGH FLYER 
A CITY BOY PERHAPS 
TOO MANY RED HERRINGS THERE 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE REAL CLUES 
THE BIG IMPACT THE POLITICAL AGENDA AND THE STRONG WORDS 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LISA 
NOW FOR OUR HOME AND THE STUDIO AUDIENCE 
HERE IS WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
O. K. JENNY THIS TIME WE BEGIN WITH YOU 
MM INTERESTING SOMEBODY A BIT OF A THINKER 
I WAS JUST WAITING FOR A BIT OF ENCOURAGEMENT 
BIT OF A THINKER 
THANK YOU WAIT FOR THE APPLAUSE 
SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT INTERESTED REALLY 
IN SORT OF MUCH MORE THAN READING BOOKS 
PLAYING CHESS 
PLAYING GAMES 
NO INTEREST TO ME WHATSOEVER TO BE HONEST 
OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T LIKE GOING SHOPPING 
ESPECIALLY FOR FOOD 
DOESN'T EAT JUST READS READS A LOT 
QUITE OUTSPOKEN I THINK LIKES TO BE HEARD 
THERE YOU GO 
LIKES HIS OPINIONS HEARD 
A GOOD CHARACTER STUDY THERE OVER TO YOU ANTON 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A MAN 
HE SPENDS I WOULD SAY 
THANK YOU HE SPENDS I JUST WENT WITH WHAT LISA SAID 
BUT THANKS FOR BEING IMPRESSED 
HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME AROUND I WOULD SAY THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT 
AND I WOULD SUGGEST HIS FAVOURITE COLOUR MIGHT BE YELLOW 
I THINK THAT DEFINITELY MUST BE 
AND POTENTIALLY MAYBE A WEE PENCHANT FOR CERTAIN THINGS CHEEKY 
JENNIE 
I THINK I KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING AND IT'S A GOOD DIRECTION 
I THINK THIS IS QUITE A NAUGHTY SLIGHTLY NUTSY INDIVIDUAL 
AN ECCENTRIC 
A BIKER MAYBE LIKES FLYING 
AFTER DINNER SPEAKING PROBABLY LIKES THE SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE 
THAT'S A QUALIFICATION IF YOU'RE IN POLITICS THAT'S RIGHT 
YEAH I THINK WE'RE HEADING DOWN THE LIB DEM ROUTE 
AND THE QUESTION IS 
HE LIKES TO BE A LITTLE BIT CONTROVERSIAL SOMETIMES 
IF HE CAN GET AWAY WITH IT I THINK 
THE ROMANIAN DICTIONARY WAS A BIT OF A GIVEAWAY 
SEE IF SOMEONE LIKE I MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF HIM 
BECAUSE OF THOSE SILLY MAGAZINES WHERE OTHER PEOPLE 
WOULD HAVE HEARD OF HIM FROM READING THE TIMES AND THE TELEGRAPH 
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN A FEW CHATTY GOSSIPY MAGAZINES AND THINGS YES 
AS WELL AS BEING A POLITICAL PERSON 
YES HE HAS A PUBLIC LIFE IN MORE SENSES OF THE WORD THAN ONE 
MM 
WHAT ABOUT ALL THIS ASTRONOMY BUSINESS 
YES THAT'S A BIT WACKY I THINK THIS PERSON IS WACKY 
MAYBE HIS HEAD'S IN THE CLOUDS OH I LIKE THAT 
I THINK POET 
I THINK THAT ASTRONOMY STUFF RUNS IN THE FAMILY 
AH 
O. K. 
SO WE HAVEN'T GOT TO GUESS WHAT STAR SIGN HE IS AS WELL HAVE WE 
NO BUT IF YOU CAN GET THAT YOU GET A SPECIAL BONUS 
OOH I THINK HE'S A SAGITTARIUS ALL RIGHT 
WE'LL FIND OUT IN A MOMENT BUT CAN WE FIND OUT FIRST 
WHO IS GONNA SAY THE NAME 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE JENNIE YES 
WE WROTE IT DOWN AT THE SAME TIME 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DID JENNY NO WE WROTE LEMBIT OPIK 
AND YOU WERE RIGHT HOORAY IT'S LEMBIT OPIK 
SO LEMBIT OPIK WILL YOU COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
WELL DONE 
NOW IN FACT THEY GOT THERE VERY COMMANDINGLY 
AND QUICKLY DIDN'T THEY 
IT'S A TREMENDOUS RELIEF 
THOUGH I AM PISCES NOT SAGITTARIUS 
AWW I WAS GONNA SAY PISCES 
NOT BAD IT'S ALMOST THE SAME 
TALKING ALMOST THE SAME NOT ALMOST THE SAME 
THE DICTIONARY THERE THAT WAS BETWEEN ENGLISH AND ROMANIAN 
YOUR BACKGROUND IS ESTONIAN THAT'S RIGHT NOT ROMANIAN 
DOES ROMANIA COVER ESTONIA FOR DICTIONARIES 
NO I HAD TO GO TO A SPECIALIST SHOP TO GET THAT ONE 
TO PLAY SCRABBLE WITH MY OTHER HALF 
SHE BASICALLY USES THAT TO IMPROVE HER ENGLISH 
AND I USE IT TO IMPROVE MY ROMANIAN 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT THE SAME AS ESTONIAN AT ALL 
IT'S NOT THAT ENGLISH IS SPOKEN HERE AND EVERYONE ELSE SPEAKS FOREIGN 
THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ALL ACROSS EUROPE 
IT'S ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILES APART BETWEEN ESTONIA AND ROMANIA 
I SPOKE ESTONIAN BEFORE I SPOKE ENGLISH WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL 
WHICH WASN'T TOO HANDY IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
BUT GROWING UP IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
THE FAMILY'S HOME LANGUAGE IS ESTONIAN 
HOW DID YOU DEAL WITH THE TRANSITION 
MY PARENTS KNEW THAT ONCE I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO GO TO SCHOOL 
I'D LEARN ENGLISH ANYWAY 
SO WE SPOKE ESTONIAN UNTIL I WAS ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE 
AND THEN I WENT TO SCHOOL AND I REMEMBER THE FIRST THING I NOTICED 
WAS WHAT FUNNY NAMES EVERYBODY ELSE HAD 
THEN I THOUGHT MAYBE LEMBIT OPIK ISN'T AS COMMON AS I THOUGHT 
WHEN I WAS AT HOME 
MY SISTER ACTUALLY HAD A BIT MORE TROUBLE WITH IT 
BUT MY BROTHER FITTED IN PERFECTLY 
WE WERE ABOUT HALF OF THE ENTIRE ESTONIAN COMMUNITY 
OF NORTHERN IRELAND AT THE TIME YOU WERE 
WE GOT ON WITH THE OTHER HALF QUITE WELL 
BUT WE DIDN'T SEE THEM VERY OFTEN 
AT THE SAME TIME AS OUR PANEL RIGHTLY SAID 
ALL FORMS OF STARS HAVE BEEN PART OF YOUR LIFE 
DO YOU FIND THE COVERAGE OF YOUR PRIVATE LIFE BECOMING PUBLIC IS FUN 
FIRST OF ALL I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY STRESSFUL 
BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF A FREE FOR ALL 
IN POLITICS YOU GET JUDGED FOR YOUR POLICIES AND YOUR VIEWS 
IF YOU DO CELEBRITY STUFF YOU'RE JUDGED AS THE PERSON YOU ARE 
THE PERSONALITY THE CHARACTER THAT IS MORE STRESSFUL 
BUT THERE'S NOTHING WE COULD DO ABOUT IT ME AND MY PARTNER 
ACTUALLY I THINK WE'VE COME TO ENJOY IT NOW IT IS A BIT OF FUN 
I THINK IT HELPS ME REACH PEOPLE IN THE POLITICAL WORLD 
WHO AREN'T INTERESTED IN POLITICS 
THE DANGER IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A POLITICAL NARRATIVE TO DO THAT 
IF YOU LOSE THE NARRATIVE YOU JUST BECOME A B. LIST CELEBRITY 
THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT MY CORE BUSINESS IS IT'S ABOUT POLITICS 
WHAT'S YOUR AMBITION 
I SUPPOSE TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM ASTEROID IMPACT 
ONCE I'VE DONE THAT I CAN MAYBE CAMPAIGN FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES ISSUES 
IN POLITICS THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME 
THAT'S WHY I GUESS I'M A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT 
OUTSIDE POLITICS I FLY PLANES 
IF I CAN DO THOSE TWO THINGS I'LL BE A HAPPY MAN 
YOU WERE LUCKY ONCE IN A CRASH WEREN'T YOU 
YES I NEARLY GOT KILLED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THIRTEENTH OF APRIL 
WHEN I WAS PARAGLIDING 
IT'S LIKE A SORT OF PARACHUTE THAT YOU JUMP OFF A HILL 
AND YOU'RE MEANT TO STAY IN THE AIR BUT I DIDN'T 
I FELL ABOUT THIRTY METRES BROKE MY BACK IN TWELVE PLACES 
AND I WAS A DISASTER OF AN ACCIDENT SMASHED MY RIBS MY STERNUM MY JAW 
AND THE INCREDIBLE THING IS I HAD ENOUGH OF A SURVIVAL INSTINCT 
TO WALK A MILE WITH A BROKEN BACK 
YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO WALK WITH A BROKEN BACK 
BUT THE CHOICE WAS WALK OR DIE 
SO IN THE END I WALKED TO THE CAR YOU'D HAVE DIED 
THE EXTENT OF THE INJURIES WAS SO GREAT THAT 
YOU HAD TO GET THERE QUICKLY 
WE WERE NOWHERE NEAR A HOSPITAL FOURTEEN MILES FROM THE LOCAL HOSPITAL 
LLANIDLOES IN MY CONSTITUENCY A SMALL PLACE 
THEN FORTY EIGHT MILES EXTRA IN AN AMBULANCE TO GET TO SHREWSBURY HOSPITAL 
AND THEY LITERALLY SAVED MY LIFE 
SO IT CHANGES YOUR STATE OF MIND ABOUT THINGS 
IT MAKES YOU RELAX MORE AND ENJOY THE JOURNEY OF LIFE 
RATHER THAN ALWAYS BEING FOCUSED ON A PARTICULAR DESTINATION 
WE'RE DELIGHTED YOU SURVIVED NOT AS HAPPY AS I AM 
WE HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO SURVIVE 
A THE GOSSIP COLUMNISTS AND B. THE WORLD OF POLITICS 
IT'S BEEN A DELIGHT TO HAVE YOU WITH US THANKS A LOT 
IT'S ALL BEEN WORTH IT FOR THIS 
THIS IS THE TRUTH THE VALIDATION OF THE FACT YOU WERE HERE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US LEMBIT OPIK LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
OUR THANKS TO LEMBIT OPIK 
AND THAT DELIGHTFUL EQUALLY FAMOUS PERSON IN PART ONE CAPRICE 
AND OF COURSE OUR PANEL TOO 
THE CELEBRITIES OVER THERE JENNIE BOND 
ANTON DU BEKE 
AND JENNY POWELL 
UNTIL THE NEXT TIME GOODBYE FOR NOW
