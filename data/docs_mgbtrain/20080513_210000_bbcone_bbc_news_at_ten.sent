THOSE AFFECTED BY THE ABOLITION OF 
THE TEN P. BAND WILL NOW BE 
COMPENSATED WITH HIGHER PERSONAL 
ALLOWANCES 
THE CHANGE I AM ALLOWANCES ANNOUNCING TODAY REPRESENTS THE 
FAIREST AND MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO 
HELP ALL THOSE AFFECTED THIS THIS SOUNDED LESS LIKE A CONSIDERED 
STATEMENT FROM A CHANCELLOR AND 
MORE LIKE A CYNICAL PRESS RELEASE 
IN A BY ELECTION 
WE REVEAL THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S 
ENTIRE BUDGET WAS UNDER THREAT IF 
IT HAD NOT BACKED DOWN 
ALSO TONIGHT 
IN CHINA UP TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
MISSING AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE AND 
RISING CONCERN FOR THE SURVIVORS 
IT IS RAINING THERE IS NO POWER 
THERE IS NO WATER AND THEY FEAR 
THERE ARE GOING TO BE AFTERSHOCKS 
THE MOCK UP EXPLOSION SHOWN TO THE 
JURY TRYING THE EIGHT MEN ACCUSED 
OF PLOTTING TO BLOW UP PASSENGER 
PLANES PLANES AND HOW THE TURKISH FIRST LADY MADE 
A STATEMENT AS SHE WELCOMED THE 
QUEEN ON STATE VISIT 
ON B. B. C. LONDON 
THE MET PROMISE AN INCREASE IN 
STOP AND SEARCH TO COMBAT TEENAGE 
MURDERS MURDERS AND B. A. BAGGAGE BAN MEANS OLYMPIC 
HOPEFULS MAY HAVE TO TRAVEL TO 
BEIJING WITHOUT VITAL KIT 
GOOD EVENING THE STORM OVER THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX BAND 
WHICH LEFT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WORSE 
OFF HAS NOW LED TO TAX CUT FOR 
TWENTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE THE DRASTIC 
ACTION WAS TAKEN BY THE CHANCELLOR 
FACED WITH A REBELLION BY LABOUR 
M. P.'S MR. DARLING SAID HE WOULD 
BORROW TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION TO PAY FOR THE 
SCHEME BUT THE CONSERVATIVES SAY 
THE TIMING A WEEK BEFORE A 
PARLIAMENTARY BY ELECTION IS 
CYNICAL LET'S JOIN OUR POLITICAL 
EDITOR NICK ROBINSON IN DOWNING 
STREET STREET THIS WAS QUITE SIMPLY AN 
EMERGENCY BUDGET THE EMERGENCY 
NOT ECONOMIC NOT FINANCIAL BUT 
POLITICAL GORDON BROWN HAD BEEN 
WARNED THAT WITHOUT SERIOUS CHANGE 
HIS BUDGET FACED DEFEAT IN THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS AT THE HANDS OF 
LABOUR M. P.'S AND THAT WOULD HAVE LED 
TO SERIOUS CALLS FOR HIM TO QUIT 
IT IS THE BIGGEST TAX GIVEAWAY FOR 
SEVEN YEARS TWENTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN PROMISED AN UNEXPECTED TAX CUT 
PAID FOR BY FOREIGN ALMOST THREE 
BILLION BORROWING THOSE 
WATCHING THE CHANCELLOR TODAY 
EXPECTED LITTLE AFTER ALL ONLY 
TEN WEEKS AGO THEY HAD HEARD HIM 
SAY THEY HAD NO MONEY TO GIVE AWAY 
BUT TODAY WAS DIFFERENT 
AT A COST 
OF TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION I WILL INCREASE 
THE INDIVIDUAL PERSONAL TAX 
ALLOWANCES BY SIX HUNDRED TO SIX THOUSAND THIRTY FIVE FOR 
THIS FINANCIAL YEAR BENEFITING ALL 
PRESENT TAXPAYERS UNDER THE AGE OF 
SIXTY FIVE 
IF IT IS A CHANGE THAT WILL SIXTY FIVE MEAN TWENTY TWO MILLION BASIC RATE 
TAXPAYERS GAINED ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THIS YEAR 
EVEN SO ELEVEN MILLION HOUSEHOLDS 
WILL STILL LOSE OUT FROM THE 
SCRAPPING OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE THE 
GOVERNMENT NEEDS THIS PAYOUT TO BE 
APPRECIATED IN CREWE MORE THAN 
ANYWHERE ELSE NEXT WEEK'S BY 
ELECTION HERE COULD PROVE CRUCIAL 
FOR GORDON BROWN 
ANYTHING TO HELP 
THE YOUNG ONES AND THE POORER ONES 
AND THE LOWER INCOME ONES FIND 
BUT IT IS A SHAME IT HAD TO HAPPEN 
IN THE FIRST PLACE 
I THINK THEY 
JUST TRY TO KID US ALL THE TIME ON 
FIGURES THEY SAY THEY ARE GIVING 
US ONE HUNDRED TWENTY BACK L. HAVE ALREADY LOST 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HE TORIES ACCUSED THE 
CHANCELLOR OF PANICKING BEFORE THE 
BY ELECTION AND PROMISING A TAX 
CUT FOR JUST ONE YEAR ONLY 
HE SO IT'S UP A TAX AND EXPECT 
PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IT HE SERVES UP 
A TAX 
WHAT TOTAL INCOMPETENCE AND WHAT 
COMPLETE HUMILIATION FOR THIS 
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER 
BY THE 
MAN WHO LED THE LABOUR REVOLT WAS 
IN FULL RETREAT 
MAY I CONGRATULATE 
THE CHANCELLOR FOR PUTTING AN END 
TO THIS ISSUE ALLOWED MY CAMPAIGN 
TO BECOME PERSONAL L. MUCH REGRET 
THAT AND I APOLOGISE WITHOUT 
RESERVATION 
THE TEN P. TAX SAGA HAS RESERVATION BEEN VERY PERSONAL FOR GORDON BROWN 
AS CHANCELLOR HE SCRAPPED IT I I CAN NOW RETURN INCOME TAX TO JUST 
TWO RATES BY REMOVING THE TEN P. BAN 
ON ON SAVINGS INCOME A NEW YEAR 
LATER HE WATCHED HIS CHANCELLOR DO 
NOTHING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS CAUSED 
AT FIRST HE DENIED THERE WERE ANY 
LOSERS BEFORE FINALLY PROMISING 
HELP BUT AT MUCH LOWER COST THAN 
WE HAVE SEEN TODAY 
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU SPEND ON TAKING 
THE RIGHT DECISION 
IT WILL BE LESS 
THAN ONE BILLION 
IF IT IS 
PARTICULARLY DAMAGING FOR GORDON 
BROWN BECAUSE HE HAS BOUGHT SHORT 
TERM PEACE WITH HIS OWN 
BACKBENCHERS AT THE COST OF 
SACRIFICING THE ECONOMIC 
CREDIBILITY THAT HE BUILT UP OVER 
TEN YEARS HE HAS NOT GOT THE MONEY 
TO FINANCE THIS 
TO A.'S PACKAGE MAY 
HAVE AVERTED THE SPILLING OF 
POLITICAL BLOOD IN THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO 
END GORDON BROWN'S LONG TEN P. TAX 
NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE THE CHANCELLOR EMPHASISED THAT EIGHTY PER CENT 
OF AFFECTED HOUSEHOLDS WERE BEING 
FULLY COMPENSATED FOR THE TAX 
CHANGES BUT AS NICK WAS SAYING IT 
IS AN EXPENSIVE RESPONSE TO THE 
PROBLEM OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR IS 
WITH ME TO LOOK AT THE FIGURES 
THE GOVERNMENT IS USUALLY 
CRITICISED FOR ITS COMPLICATED TAX 
GIMMICKS TODAY'S MOVE IS 
SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE BUT EXPENSIVE 
IN EFFECT THE CHANCELLOR HAS 
TURNED A ROW OVER TEN P. INTO A TWO POINT SEVEN 
BILLION GIVEAWAY THE TREASURY HAS 
NOT GIVEN THAT KIND OF MONEY AWAY 
SINCE THE PRE ELECTION BUDGET IN 
TWO THOUSAND ONE THERE WERE FIFTY ONE MILLION 
HOUSEHOLDS WHO LOST OUT FROM THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. BAND THAT WAS 
BY THROWING MONEY AT THE PROBLEM 
ALISTAIR DARLING TODAY HAS CREATED 
TWENTY TWO MILLION WINNERS BUT WHEN THE 
DUST SETTLES THERE WILL STILL BE 
ONE POINT ONE MILLION LOSERS FROM THE 
ORIGINAL CHANGE ON AVERAGE THEY 
WILL BE POORER THAN THE HOUSEHOLDS 
THAT ARE BEING HELPED THIS IS 
MONEY CHANCELLOR DOES NOT HAVE A 
SLOWER ECONOMY WAS ALREADY LIKELY 
TO ADD BILLIONS TO HIS BORING OVER 
THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND HE WAS 
ALREADY CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S 
CEILING FOR PUBLIC DEBT 
THIS IS 
ESSENTIALLY AN EXTRA TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION 
THAT HAS TO BE BORROWED THIS YEAR 
THAT EFFECTIVELY USES UP THE 
REMAINING ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE THAT 
THE TREASURY HAD 
BEFORE TODAY HE 
WAS ONLY MEETING IN THE DEBT RULE 
WITH TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION TO SPARE IN TWO THOUSAND TEN 
TODAY'S BORROWING SPREE DOES NOT 
LEAVE A LOT LEFT THAT IS IF HE 
FINDS A WAY TO TAKE BACK THE SIX HUNDRED 
ON ALLOWANCES HE HAS GIVEN AWAY 
TODAY WHEN HE WRITES NEXT YEAR'S 
BUDGET 
THE GENERAL RULE IS THAT BUDGET PERSONAL ALLOWANCES GO UP IN LINE 
WITH INFLATION THIS YEAR THE 
PERSONAL TAX FREE ALLOWANCE HAS 
GONE UP BY TWO HUNDRED SO IN THE ORDINARY 
COURSE OF THINGS WE WOULD EXPECT 
ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED NEXT YEAR 
COULD THAT SIX HUNDRED BE SCALED BACK THE THE CHANCELLOR HAS CREATED A BIG 
CHALLENGE FOR NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET 
WITH TODAY'S GIVEAWAY IF THAT THIS 
SAGA TEACHES ANYTHING IT IS THAT 
EXPENSIVE CHANGES ARE HARD TO 
UNPICK IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO 
DRAW MONEY BACK BUT THAT IS A 
PROBLEM FOR NEXT SPRING FOR THIS 
GOVERNMENT THAT PROBABLY SEEMED A 
LONG TIME AWAY 
LET'S GO BACK TO NICK ROBINSON IN 
DOWNING STREET YOU HEARD THE 
DETAIL AND SAW THE SCALE OF THE 
RESPONSE HOW SURPRISED WERE YOU I I WAS SHOCKED THOSE M. P.'S WHO HEARD 
THE PACKAGE WERE SHOCKED THE 
CABINET WERE DELIGHTED BECAUSE THEY 
THOUGHT THIS MIGHT DEAL WITH THE 
SHORT TERM POLITICAL PROBLEM 
ALISTAIR DARLING CAN ARGUE THAT 
THIS WAS THE MOST PRACTICAL WAY TO 
HELP THE LOSERS FROM THE TEN P. TAX 
PROBLEM THAT SENDING THEM CHEQUES 
WAS BUREAUCRATIC AND COMPLICATED 
AND WOULD BE CONFUSING AND TAKE A 
LONG TIME BUT THIS IS A MASSIVE 
INJECTION OF CASH AT A TIME WHEN 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT GOT ANY AND 
WHATEVER PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED IN THE 
SHORT TERM MAY LOOK VERY DIFFERENT 
IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG 
WHAT ARE YOU 
SAYING ABOUT GORDON BROWN'S CHANCES 
OF GETTING OUT OF THIS HERE IS OUT 
OF THE TEN P. TAX HOLE IN THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS 
HE WILL NOT NOW LOSE A COMMONS VOTE THAT COULD HAVE LED TO HIM 
LOSING HIS JOB WHETHER HE IS OUT 
OF THE BIGGER HALL IS A MUCH MORE 
OPEN QUESTION THERE IS STILL A 
THREATENED REBELLION ON THE 
EXTENDED DETENTION TO FORTY TWO DAYS IN 
THE END IT IS THE VOTERS THAT WILL 
HAVE THEIR FINAL SAY THAT IS WHY 
THE HOUSING MINISTER WAS SPOTTED 
WALKING UP THE STREET CARRYING A 
NOTE THAT A PHOTOGRAPHER TOOK OFF 
WITH A REMINDER SAYING WE ARE ON 
THE VOTERS' SIDE THAT IS THE E. U. 
MESSAGE YOU WILL HEAR AGAIN AND 
AGAIN IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS YOU 
WILL HEAR IT TOMORROW WHEN THE 
PRIME MINISTER UNVEILS HIS PLAN FOR 
THE NEXT YEAR OF LEGISLATION BUT 
IN THE END THOSE VOTERS IN CREWE 
AND IN BY ELECTIONS WILL MAKE THE 
DECISION LABOUR M. P.'S WILL WAIT AND 
WATCH AND DECIDE WHAT TO DO 
CHINESE RESCUE WORKERS ARE 
STRUGGLING TO REACH THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE TRAPPED UNDER COLLAPSED 
BUILDINGS MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER 
THE POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE IN SOUTH 
WEST CHINA OFFICIALS SAY THAT 
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BURIED IN 
ONE CITY ALONE MIANYANG AND 
ACROSS THE REGION COME UP TO 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR THE 
EARTHQUAKE HAS DEVASTATED THE 
SICHUAN PROVINCE HOME TO NEARLY EIGHTY SEVEN 
MILLION CHINESE THE EPICENTRE WAS 
IN THE MOUNTAINOUS COUNTY OF 
WENCHUAN RESCUE TEAMS HAVE ONLY 
JUST GOT THERE TODAY THE OFFICIAL 
DEATH TOLL NOW STANDS OUT AT LEAST 
TWELVE THOUSAND BUT THAT NUMBER IS EXPECTED 
TO RISE ONE OF THE WORST HIT TOWNS 
IS DUJIANGYAN OUR REPORT DOES 
CONTAIN SOME DISTRESSING IMAGES 
RESCUERS HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR 
SURVIVORS THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COULD BE BURIED 
IN THE RUBBLE MANY CHILDREN HAVE 
BORNE THE BRUNT OF THIS EARTHQUAKE 
BUT THIS GIRL WAS LUCKY SHE WAS 
PULLED OUT ALIVE FROM THIS SCHOOL 
BUILDING AT A HOSPITAL IN THE CITY 
OF DUJIANGYAN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE 
WERE FEARED TRAPPED WHEN PART OF IT 
FELL DOWN L. SAW FRIENDS AND 
RELATIVES GATHERED AT THE HOSPITAL 
ENTRANCE FOR NEWS BUT THE 
EXPRESSIONS ON THE FACES OF THE 
WAITING HOSPITAL WORKERS TOLD THEIR 
OWN STORY ONLY ONE BODY WAS PULLED 
FROM THE HOSPITAL RUBBLE TODAY 
ACROSS THE CITY AT A MIDDLE SCHOOL 
PARENTS ALSO WAITED FOR NEWS THE 
SCHOOL COLLAPSED DURING THE 
EARTHQUAKE TRAPPING HUNDREDS OF 
PUPILS INSIDE MANY DIED AS I WENT 
AROUND DUJIANGYAN THERE WAS FEAR 
THAT AFTERSHOCKS COULD CAUSE MORE 
DAMAGE PEOPLE ABANDON THEIR HOMES 
FEARING THEY COULD STILL COLLAPSE 
THESE PEOPLE AROUND ME ARE SPENDING 
THEIR SECOND NIGHT IN THE OPEN AIR 
IT IS RAINING THERE IS NO POWER 
THERE IS NO WATER AND THEY FEAR 
THERE ARE GOING TO BE AFTERSHOCKS 
OTHERS DECIDED IT WAS BETTER TO 
LEAVE THE CITY ALTOGETHER AND 
PACKED UP THEIR BELONGINGS 
SOLDIERS FROM CHINA'S PEOPLE'S 
LIBERATION ARMY WERE LEADING THE 
RESCUE EFFORTS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
HAVE ALREADY BEEN CONFIRMED DEAD 
AND THE AUTHORITIES FEAR THAT THAT 
NUMBER WILL RISE AS RESCUERS 
REACHED MORE ISOLATED AREAS 
CHINA HAS DEPLOYED FIFTY THOUSAND TROOPS TO 
THE WORST AFFECTED AREAS ALONG 
WITH SPECIALIST RESCUE TEAMS BUT 
THE EXTENT OF THE DEVASTATION AND 
THE SCALE OF THE AREA ARE MAKING 
THE OPERATION EVEN MORE DAUNTING 
CHINA SEEMS DETERMINED TO SHOW THE 
OUTSIDE WORLD THAT EVERYTHING 
POSSIBLE IS BEING DONE TO HELP ITS 
PEOPLE OUR CORRESPONDENT IS IN 
CHENGDU AND SENT HIS REPORT 
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED AT TWO THIRTY P. M. ON 
A MONDAY AFTERNOON IN SOUTHERN 
CHINA THE EARTHQUAKE HITS CHENGDU 
AIRPORT NO ONE KNOWS WHAT TO DO 
AT THIS MOMENT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
IN THE REGION HAVE JUST LOST THEIR 
LIVES BUT SOME HAVE SURVIVED HERE 
A GIRL IS HELPED FROM THE RUBBLE 
PEOPLE OFFER HELP WHEREVER THEY CAN 
THE EARTHQUAKE HAS BLOCKED ROADS 
AND CUT OFF MANY AREAS TRY DRIVING 
A CAR ALONG THIS IT IS NOT YET 
DAWNED BUT BEHIND A ROW OF 
SOLDIERS KYLE RESCUE WORK IS 
CARRYING ON WHEN IT GETS LIGHT 
THIS KIND OF THING WILL GO ON IN 
OTHER AREAS OF THE REGION IT HAS 
ALL BEEN MADE DIFFICULT BY THE RAIN 
WHICH CARRIES ON CHINA'S PREMIER 
WEN JIABAO HAS COME HERE TO LEAD 
THE RESCUE HE IS KEEN TO SHOW HIS 
GOVERNMENT IS REACTING QUICKLY SO 
CHINA HAS PUT ITS MILITARY TO WORK 
SOLDIERS EMERGENCY WORKERS HAVE 
BEEN DRAFTED IN TO HELP IN THE 
PAST CHINA DOWNPLAYED THE SCALE OF 
HIS DISASTERS BUT NOT THIS TIME 
THERE ARE STILL MANY IN REMOTE 
AREAS WHO NEED HELP THIS YEAR WE 
HAD ALL SEEN THE OLYMPIC GAMES AS 
THE GREAT TEST FOR CHINA BUT THE 
WAY THIS NATION HANDLES THIS 
EARTHQUAKE MAY END UP TELLING US 
JUST AS MUCH ABOUT THE KIND OF 
COUNTRY THAT CHINA WANTS TO BECOME 
WE HAVE JUST MANAGED TO MAKE 
CONTACT WITH OUR CORRESPONDENT WHO 
IS ALSO IN CHENGDU HOW IS THE 
RESCUE OPERATION GOING 
THE CHINESE 
AUTHORITIES HAVE MOBILISED A 
MASSIVE RESCUE OPERATION FIFTY THOUSAND 
TROOPS ON THE GROUND HERE THEIR 
PRIORITY IS TRYING TO PULL AS MANY 
PEOPLE OUT OF THE RUBBLE AS 
POSSIBLE WHO ARE STILL ALIVE AND 
GETTING FOOD AND SHELTER AND AID TO 
THOSE THAT NEED IT MOST BUT THERE 
ARE MANY AREAS THEY STILL HAVE NOT 
MANAGED TO GET TO AND THE REAL 
FEAR IS THAT IN THE COMING DAYS WE 
MAY SEE THAT DEATH TOLL THE NUMBER 
OF DEAD AND CASUALTIES RISE 
SIGNIFICANTLY SIGNIFICANTLY THE JURY IN THE TRIAL OF EIGHT MEN 
ACCUSED OF PLOTTING TO BLOW UP 
TRANSATLANTIC PLANES HAS BEEN SHOWN 
A VIDEO SHOWING THE POTENTIAL 
EFFECTS OF THE LIQUID BOMB 
EXPLOSIVES EXPERTS HAVE STAGED AN 
EXPLOSION USING THE SAME 
INGREDIENTS ALLEGEDLY PLANNED BY 
THE DEFENDANTS THEY ALL DENY THE 
CHARGES CHARGES IN BOMB PROOF ROOM THE FORENSIC 
EXPLOSIVES LABORATORY THE REASON 
WHY LIQUIDS ARE NOW RESTRICTED ON 
AIRCRAFT THIS SOFT DRINKS BOTTLE 
IS ABOUT TO DETONATE THE DOUBLE 
THICKNESS LAMINATED GLASS HAS 
SHATTERED REPEATED IN SLOW MOTION 
YOU CAN SEE THE MOMENT THE OASIS 
BOTTLE GOES OFF IT CONTAINS A 
MIXTURE OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE AND A 
SUGARY DRINK POWDER IT HAS BEEN 
DETONATED BY A HOME MADE HIGH 
EXPLOSIVE MADE FROM CITRIC ACID AND 
A CAMPING STOVE FUEL CALLED 
HEXAMINE THE PICTURES WERE SHOWN 
AT TODAY AT THE TRIAL OF EIGHT MEN 
ACCUSED OF PLOTTING TO BLOW UP 
AIRCRAFT OVER THE ATLANTIC WITH 
LIQUID EXPLOSIVES AN IMPORTANT 
QUESTION IN THIS CASE IS WHETHER IT 
IS POSSIBLE TO TAKE THIS DRINK 
POWDER CALLED PAM AND MIX IT WITH 
HIGH STRENGTH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE 
TANK AND PUT IT IN A DRINKS BOTTLE 
LIKE THIS TO CREATE A LIQUID BOMB 
BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT GOVERNMENT 
SCIENTISTS MANAGED TO DO THE 
POLICE DISCOVERED THESE BOTTLES IN 
A LONDON FLAT THE LIQUID HAD BEEN 
CAREFULLY DRAINED OUT IN WOODS IN 
HIGH WYCOMBE THEY FOUND HYDROGEN 
PEROXIDE IN MINERAL WATER BOTTLES 
AND A SUITCASE CONTAINING CHEMICALS 
AND EQUIPMENT TO MAKE DETONATING 
EXPLOSIVE CALLED H. AND AMP M. T. D. BUT 
GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS ACKNOWLEDGE 
IT TOOK THEM MORE THAN THIRTY TESTS TO 
PRODUCE AN EXPLOSION AND THE EIGHT 
MEN ON TRIAL DENY CONSPIRACY TO 
MURDER MURDER IN BURMA THE UNITED NATIONS SAYS 
EMERGENCY AIR OR SEA CORRIDOR IS 
NEEDED TO DELIVER THE SUPPLIES 
AFTER THE RECENT CYCLONE FOOD IS 
STARTING TO GET TO SURVIVORS BUT 
SO FAR UN TEAMS HAVE REACHED BARELY 
TWENTY PER CENT OF THOSE IN NEED OUR 
CORRESPONDENT WHO CANNOT BE NAMED 
FOR HIS OWN SAFETY HAS BEEN TO ONE 
AREA OF BURMA WHERE AID IS SLOWLY 
STARTING TO ARRIVE 
IN THE PADDY FIELDS OF SOUTHERN 
BURMA THERE IS STILL FOOD FOR 
SOME THE LANDSCAPE IS LITTERED 
WITH THE CARCASSES OF LIVESTOCK 
THE CYCLONE HAS KILLED PEOPLE AND 
FLATTENED THE HOMES OF THOSE WHO 
SURVIVED BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
WE FOUND THIS FAMILY DOING ITS 
BEST TO SHELTER FROM THE WIND IN 
THE PADDY FIELD BEHIND THEM ARE 
THE REMAINS OF THEIR HOUSE WHEN 
THE STORM CAME THEY WERE FORCED TO 
SWIM TO SAFETY THE MOTHER IS STILL 
IN SHOCK AND SHE TELLS US THEY NOW 
HAVE NOTHING LEFT AS WE TALK A 
PICK UP TRUCK APPEARS IT IS 
BUSINESSMAN FROM THE CAPITAL 
RANGOON WHO HAS COME TO HELP HE 
BRINGS WATER AND CAKES IT IS NOT 
ENOUGH AND IT MAY NOT BE 
APPROPRIATE BUT IT IS THE ONLY AID 
THESE PEOPLE HAVE SEEN OUR COMPANY 
HAS RAISED ONE HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS ONE OF HIS WORKERS 
SAYS SO WE ARE HANDED OUT SUPPLIES 
THERE ARE ONLY MATTER AID 
AGENCIES IN THIS PART OF THE DELTA 
BURMA'S GENERALS HAVE INSISTED THAT 
THEY ARE GETTING TO GRIPS WITH THIS 
CRISIS STATE TELEVISION SHOWS ONE 
OF BURMA'S FEW HELICOPTERS 
DELIVERING AID BUT EVEN THE 
GOVERNMENT ACKNOWLEDGES IT HAS NOT 
REACHED SOME MORE ISOLATED AREAS 
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY FOOD 
IS BEING DISTRIBUTED ON OUR 
JOURNEY WE SAW RICE BEING HANDED 
OUT BUT THERE IS A SENSE THAT THE 
AID EFFORT IS PIECEMEAL INADEQUATE 
AND UNCO ORDINATED IN THIS TOWN 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ERECTED TENTS TO 
HOUSE THE HOMELESS BUT THEY ARE 
NOT BEING USED AT LEAST NOT AS 
INTENDED LESS THAN AN HOUR AWAY 
THE TENTS ARE BADLY NEEDED IT IS 
RAINING AGAIN HERE AND IN THIS 
VILLAGE MOST OF THE HOMES HAVE GONE 
OR ARE BADLY DAMAGED THE LOCAL 
MONASTERY IS TRYING TO HELP SOME OF 
THE WORST OFF THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED 
HOUSES IN THIS VILLAGE AND THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS MANAGED TO SEND JUST 
ONE BAG OF RICE THAT MAY BE 
SOMETHING PEOPLE HERE WILL NOT SOON 
FORGET 
NOW SOARING FOOD AND ENERGY BILLS 
HAVE LED TO THE BIGGEST JUMP IN 
INFLATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS 
ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL CONSUMER 
PRICES INDEX THE COST OF LIVING 
ROSE BY OH FIVE PER CENT LAST MONTH TO THREE PER CENT IT 
HAS RACED DOUBTS ABOUT THE PROSPECT 
OF A CUT IN INTEREST RATES NEXT 
MONTH ALL EYES ARE ON THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND AS IT FACES THE TOUGHEST 
CHALLENGES IN MORE THAN A DECADE OF 
INDEPENDENCE INSIDE THE GOVERNOR 
AND THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE 
HAVE A MAJOR HEADACHE INFLATION 
FIGURES DESCRIBED BY ONE ANALYST AS 
HORRIFIC THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE 
SORT OF ESSENTIALS YOU FIND IN THE 
FRIDGE OR EVERY DAY ITEMS AROUND 
THE KITCHEN HOW MUCH THE PRICES OF 
MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN GOING UP 
TAKE BREAD FOR EXAMPLE ACCORDING 
TO THE 
RETAIL PRICES'S INDEX THE 
AVERAGE PRICE HAS GONE UP THIRTEEN PER CENT OVER 
THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS THEN THERE IS 
MILK THAT'S GONE UP EVEN MORE 
ACCORDING TO THE FIGURES UP ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE PER CENT 
OVER THE LAST YEAR BUT NEITHER OF 
THOSE HAVE BEEN ANYTHING LIKE 
BUTTER THE AVERAGE PRICE HAS 
INCREASED THIRTY TWO PER CENT 
INCREASED THIRTY TWO PER CENT 
SO HOW DO SHOPPERS 
FEEL ABOUT THAT WE CAUGHT UP WITH 
KAREN WILSON AFTER HER TRIP TO BUY 
THE GROCERIES 
I HAVE NOTICED THE 
BILLS ARE GOING UP THINGS THAT ARE 
MORE OBVIOUS TO ME IS BREAD MILK 
BASICS THAT I WOULD TAKE FOR 
GRANTED THEY HAVE ADDED TEN P. TWENTY P. ONE 
FOOD MANUFACTURERS LIKE BAKERS ARE 
SEEING THEIR RAW MATERIAL COSTS 
RISING FLOUR FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE 
TO PASS IT ON TO CUSTOMERS FUEL 
PRICES ARE ON INCREASE THE COST OF 
TRANSPORTING GOODS TO THE SHOP HAS 
GONE UP IT ADDS UP TO ACCELERATING 
INFLATION FOR SERVICES AS WELL AS 
GOODS GIVING MONEY AWAY IN THE 
SHAPE OF INTEREST RATE CUTS IS HARD 
TO JUSTIFY HOUSE PRICES ARE 
FALLING THE DEMANDS FOR RATE 
REDUCTIONS ARE INTENSIFYING EVEN 
THE HOUSING MINISTER CAROLINE FLINT 
BELIEVES PRICE ALSO FALL BY UP TO 
TEN PER CENT THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO A 
DOCUMENT SPOTTED ED TO TODAY IT IT MAKES THE DECISION DIFFICULT THEY 
ARE TARGETING INFLATION WE STILL 
THINK THEY WILL HAVE TO REDUCE 
INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR BECAUSE 
THE ECONOMY IN OUR VIEW WILL BE 
WEAK INDEED 
NEXT INTEREST RATE 
MEET IS A FEW WEEKS AWAY THE 
BANK'S POLICY MAKERS WON'T BE 
LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING BACK 
ROUND THIS TABLE THE WORST 
SPRINGTIME DROUGHT TO HIT SPAIN FOR 
OH SIX YEARS HAS FORCED THE CITY OF 
BARCELONA TO TAKE RADICAL ACTION 
THEY HAVE IMPORTING DRINKING WATER 
ON A HUGE SCALE THERE ARE MORE 
DELIVERIES ON THE WAY FROM 
BARCELONA OUR CORRESPONDENT SEND 
SENT THIS REPORT AN ORDINARY 
VESWEL AN INCREDIBLY PRECIOUS CARGO 
THIS WAS THE MOMENT THAT BARCELONA 
BECAME THE FIRST MAJOR EUROPEAN 
CITY TO HAVE A SHIP SUPPLY IT WITH 
WATER WATER USUALLY IT'S OIL OR CONTAINERS THAT 
ARRIVE HERE BARCELONA FIND IT 
ISSELF SO SHORT OF WAUT THEY'RE 
THIS WILL BE THE FIRST OF NEARLY 
TWO HUNDRED DELIVERIES ALL BECAUSE OF A 
DROUGHT THAT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
ACROSS BARCELONA THE IMPACT IS 
CLEAR THE FAMOUS FOUNTAINS HAVE 
BEEN STOPPED WATER RESTRICTIONS 
ARE IN PLACE THE FOUNTAIN NOSLES 
ARE BONE DRY EVEN BEFORE THE FULL 
HEAT OF SUMMER WE TRAVELLED INTO 
THE MOUNTAINS TO SEE THE SOURCE OF 
THE PROBLEM THIS KEY RESERVOIR IS 
ALARMINGLY LOW YOU CAN SEE ALONG 
THE WATER'S EDGE THE STRIPE OF BARE 
ROCK BELOW THE TREE LINE SHOWING 
HOW MUCH THE WATER LEVEL HAS FALLEN 
THE RESERVOIR HAS EIGHTEEN PER CENT OF ITS NORMAL 
CAPACITY WHERE I'M STANDING RIGHT 
NOW SHOULD BE UNDER FORTY TO FIFTY METRES 
OF WATER BUT THIS IS SPAIN'S 
DRYEST YEAR ON RECORD WHAT IT 
MEANS HERE IS THAT THIS MEDIEVAL 
VILLAGE FLOODED FOR THE LAST FORTY 
YEARS IS EXPOSED ONCE AGAIN THE 
WATER IS STILL FLOWING BUT PEOPLE 
ARE VERY AWARE THEY MAY YET FACE 
THE THREAT OF RATIONING A. N. A. ROSA 
MARTINEZ AN ENVEHEMENTAL ACTIVISTS 
BLAMES THE POLITICIANS FOR NOT 
TACKLING THE WATER SHORTAGE SOON 
ENOUGH 
SOME PEOPLE SAY WE AS ENOUGH CITIZENS HAVE DONE ENOUGH NOW IT 
IS TIME FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO WORK 
AT THE PORT INSPECTORS HEAD ON 
BOARD TO TEST THE WATER THIS 
EXTRAORDINARY OPERATION IS MEANT TO 
FILL A GAP UNTIL NEW PIPELINE IS 
BUILT AM WITH SCIENCEISTS 
FORECASTING DRYER CONDITIONS THE 
ARRIVAL OF THIS SHIP REVEALS HOW 
RADICALLY EVEN THE MOST PROSPEROUS 
CITIES MAY HAVE TO ADAPT 
THE QUEEN IS ON HER FIRST STATE 
VISIT TO TURKEY SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE IT HAS 
BEEN SEEN AS AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT 
AS BRITAIN IS KEY SUPPORTER OF 
TURKEY'S BID TO JOIN THE EUROPEAN 
UNION A PUBLIC DISPLAY OF 
RELIGIOUS DEVOTION BY THE COUNTRY'S 
FIRST LADY REMINDED EVERYONE OF THE 
DIVISIONS BETWEEN THOSE WHO WANT 
TURKEY TO REMAIN SECULAR COUNTRY 
AND THOSE WHO WANT TO TURN IT INTO 
A SECULAR STATE THIS REPORT 
CONTAINS FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY THIS 
WAS A DAY WHEN THE PAGEANTRY OF 
STATE VISIT WAS INCIDENTAL A DAY 
WHEN A SINGLE ITEM OF CLOTHING 
DEFINED NATIONAL DEBATE AND 
EXPLAINED WHY THIS STATE VISIT BY 
THE QUEEN MATTERS 
HAYRUNNISA G. U. L. THE WIFE OF THE 
PRESIDENT OF TURKEY WORE A HEAD 
SCAR TO HAVE GREET THE QUEEN IT 
SEEMS SUCH SMALL THING BUT IN 
TURKEY THE COUNTRY WHERE RELIGION 
AND POLITICS HAVE BEEN KEPT APART 
SINCE THE MODERN STATE CREATION THE 
WEARING OF HEADSCARFS BY WOMEN IS 
CONSIDERED A RELIGIOUS STATEMENT 
AND IS BANNED IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS 
TURKEY'S RECENTLY ELECTED PRESIDENT 
PRESIDEPBT ABDULLAH G. U. L. HAS A 
BACKGROUND IN ISLAMIC POLITICS HE 
STOOD WITH HIS GUESTS OF HONOUR AND 
HIS HEADSCARFED WIFE AT A STATE 
BANQUET FROM WHICH ARMY COMMANDERS 
WERE NOTIBLY ABSENT ALL OF WHICH 
CALLS INTO QUESTION WHERE THIS 
MUSLIM COUNTRY AT THE CROSSROADS OF 
EUROPE AND ASIA IS HEADING TO AN 
ALIGNMENT WITH THE WEST OR TO THE 
CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS ROOTS OF THE 
EAST AS THE QUEEN EXPLAINED 
TONIGHT BRITAIN BELIEVES TURKEY'S 
FUTURE SHOULD BE WITH EUROPE 
TURKEY IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED AS A 
BRIDGE BETWEEN EAST AND WEST AND A 
AT A CRUCIAL TIME FOR THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND THE WORLD IN 
GENERAL 
WHAT THE QUEEN WAS SAYING GENERAL THERE IS THAT THE WEST SIMPLY 
CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE TURKEY THAT 
THE BEST WAY FORWARD IS TO BIND 
THIS COUNTRY IN MORE FULLY TO THE 
FREEDOM AND THE PROSPERITY OF 
EUROPE
