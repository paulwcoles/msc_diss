TOCCATA AND FUGUE IN D. MINOR BY JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH 
THE TOCCATA AND FUGUE IN D. MINOR ATTRIBUTED TO JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH 
IS ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC AND DRAMATIC PIECES OF MUSIC EVER WRITTEN 
TODAY BACH IS CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST COMPOSERS IN HISTORY 
YET IN REALITY HE SPENT MOST OF HIS LIFE WORKING DILIGENTLY FOR THE CHURCH 
BACH WAS IN MANY WAYS A ONE MAN MUSIC FACTORY 
HE MUST OFTEN HAVE FELT UNDERVALUED BECAUSE FOR MANY YEARS 
HE PRODUCED FOR THE CHURCH WORK OF THE VERY HIGHEST QUALITY 
WEEK AFTER WEEK AFTER WEEK 
BACH SPENT MOST OF HIS CAREER WRITING SACRED MUSIC FOR THE LUTHERAN CHURCH 
ESTABLISHED JUST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS EARLIER BY ANOTHER COMPOSER MARTIN LUTHER 
THE MONK WHO STARTED THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION 
THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW MARTIN LUTHER AND THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OF GERMAN MUSIC THAT FOLLOWED HIM 
WOULD SHAPE BACH'S WORLD AND INSPIRE HIM TO CREATE SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MUSIC EVER WRITTEN 
IN THE PAST WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT BACH'S CHORAL MUSIC 
THEY USUALLY IMAGINED PIECES WRITTEN FOR MASSED CHOIRS AND DOZENS OF PLAYERS 
IN REALITY BACH WAS SEVERELY RESTRICTED IN THE RESOURCES HE HAD TO PLAY WITH 
HE EVEN DRAFTED IN FRIENDS TO PERFORM FOR FREE 
NO EIGHTY STRONG ORCHESTRAS AND ONE HUNDRED PLUS CHOIRS FOR HIM 
AT THE VERY MOST HE HAD A HANDFUL OF PLAYERS AND INSTRUMENTALISTS TO WORK WITH 
THIS IS SAINT GEORGE'S LUTHERAN CHURCH IN LONDON 
IT OPENED IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY THREE JUST THIRTEEN YEARS AFTER BACH'S DEATH 
BACH HAS BECOME SUCH A HUGELY IMPORTANT FIGURE IN OUR MUSICAL LANDSCAPE 
HIS WORK HAS BEEN PERFORMED AND ADAPTED IN SUCH A VARIETY OF WAYS 
THAT IT'S GOOD TO REMIND OURSELVES WHAT HIS MUSIC SOUNDED LIKE TO HIM 
AND IT'S IN THAT STYLE WITH JUST EIGHT SINGERS AND A HANDFUL OF PERIOD INSTRUMENTS 
THAT HARRY CHRISTOPHERS AND THE SIXTEEN PLAY HIS MUSIC TODAY 
DURING HIS LIFETIME BACH WROTE OVER ONE THOUSAND PIECES OF MUSIC 
AND NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THESE WERE PRODUCED FOR THE LUTHERAN CHURCH 
AND THIS IS WHERE BACH WORKED DURING THE LATTER PART OF HIS LIFE 
THE THOMASKIRCHE IN LEIPZIG IN EAST GERMANY 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS EARLIER 
ANOTHER COMPOSER CAME TO THIS SAME CHURCH 
HIS IDEAS WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE A RADICAL IMPACT ON SACRED MUSIC 
BUT WOULD ULTIMATELY ALSO CHANGE THE COURSE OF WESTERN CIVILISATION 
MARTIN LUTHER THE CATHOLIC MONK WHO KICKSTARTED THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION 
REDEFINED THE ROLE OF CONGREGATIONAL SINGING EVEN THE PART PLAYED BY ORGAN MUSIC 
WITHIN CHRISTIAN WORSHIP ALLOWING THE CONGREGATION TO SING HYMNS IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE 
WAS ALSO A HUGELY SIGNIFICANT TRADITION ESTABLISHED BY HIM 
THIS IS EISENACH IN THURINGIA EAST GERMANY 
IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE BACH WAS BORN HERE 
AND TODAY EISENACH ATTRACTS SCORES OF BACH ENTHUSIASTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
THIS IS THE BACHHAUS THE WORLD'S FIRST MUSEUM DEDICATED TO THE COMPOSER IT WAS OPENED IN NINETEEN OH SEVEN 
THE APRICOT COLOURED HOUSE BEHIND ME IS CLOSE TO WHERE BACH WAS BORN AND BROUGHT UP 
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW 
BUT EISENACH IS FAMOUS FOR SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL 
FOR NEARLY ONE THOUSAND YEARS THE TOWN HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY THE IMPRESSIVE WARTBURG CASTLE 
IT WAS HERE THAT MARTIN LUTHER DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING 
THAT WOULD CHANGE THE CHRISTIAN FAITH FOREVER 
GLORIA IN EXCELSIS DEO 
ET IN TERRA 
AT THE START OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE IN WESTERN EUROPE 
AT THIS TIME THE GERMAN NATION AS SUCH DID NOT EXIST 
IT WAS A SERIES OF INDEPENDENT PRINCIPALITIES AND FEUDAL STATES 
HOWEVER THE REAL POWER LAY IN ROME FROM WHERE THE POPE NOT ONLY RULED ON RELIGIOUS MATTERS 
BUT WIELDED HUGE INFLUENCE OVER ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF POLITICAL AND CULTURAL LIFE 
IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS NEVER LUTHER'S INTENTION TO UPSET THIS BALANCE OF POWER 
LUTHER WAS A CATHOLIC MONK WHO SET OUT MERELY TO REFORM THE CHURCH 
HE ENDED UP HOWEVER CHALLENGING THE AUTHORITY OF THE POPE HIMSELF 
IN FACT HE ENDED UP CHALLENGING PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH STOOD FOR 
NOT SURPRISINGLY LUTHER WAS EXCOMMUNICATED 
WHEN HE CAME HERE TO WARTBURG IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE HE WAS IN HIDING 
AND IT WAS IN THIS ROOM THAT HE BEGAN THE HUGE TASK OF TRANSLATING THE NEW TESTAMENT INTO GERMAN 
THIS WAS THE FIRST STEP TO CREATING A STANDARD VERSION OF THE GERMAN LANGUAGE 
UP UNTIL THEN WITH THE ODD EXCEPTION ALL BIBLES WERE WRITTEN IN EITHER GREEK OR LATIN 
WHICH MADE THEM BEYOND THE REACH OF ORDINARY PEOPLE 
AND ALTHOUGH LUTHER WASN'T THE FIRST TO TRANSLATE THE BIBLE 
HIS VERSION WAS TO BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT 
WHILST HE WAS WORKING LUTHER BECAME CONVINCED 
THAT THE DEVIL WAS IN THE ROOM WITH HIM AND APPARENTLY HE THREW AN INKWELL AT HIM 
HIS TRANSLATION WAS REVOLUTIONARY NOT JUST BECAUSE NOW ANYONE WHO SPOKE GERMAN COULD READ THE BIBLE 
BUT BECAUSE IT REPRESENTED A HUGE STEP TOWARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT 
OF A SINGLE GERMAN IDENTITY 
A. T. THE HEART OF LUTHER'S THOUGHT WAS HIS BELIEF THAT 
IN THE EYES OF GOD AT LEAST MEMBERS OF THE CONGREGATION 
AND MEMBERS OF THE CLERGY WERE NO DIFFERENT 
SO WHEREAS IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH FOR THE MOST PART 
THE CLERGY SANG AND THE CONGREGATION LISTENED 
LUTHER'S IDEAS ABOUT THE ROLE OF MUSIC IN CHURCH WERE VERY DIFFERENT 
EIN' FESTE BURG IST UNSER GOTT 
EIN' GUTE WEHR UND WAFFEN 
ER HILFT UNS FREI AUS ALLER NOT 
DIE UNS JETZT HAT BETROFFEN 
ACCORDING TO LUTHER'S DOCTRINE EVERYONE HAD EQUAL ACCESS TO GOD 
THEREFORE EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORSHIP THROUGH SONG 
SO LUTHER INTRODUCED THE CONCEPT OF CONGREGATIONAL SINGING 
EIN' FESTE BURG A MIGHTY FORTRESS 
WRITTEN BY LUTHER HIMSELF 
ITS NAME ADORNS THE TOWER OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL LUTHERAN CHURCHES HERE IN WITTENBERG 
A SMALL TOWN SOME TWO FIFTY K. M. FROM EISENACH 
E.'S STREIT'T FUR UNS DER RECHTE MANN 
DEN GOTT HAT SELBST ERKOREN 
JUST ACROSS THE SQUARE IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE LUTHER HELD HIS FIRST SERVICE 
AND POSSIBLY ENCOURAGED HIS CONGREGATION TO SING A MIGHTY FORTRESS FOR THE FIRST TIME 
A MIGHTY FORTRESS IS OUR GOD 
TODAY WITTENBERG IS SEEN BY MANY 
AS THE SPIRITUAL HOME OF THE LUTHERAN CHURCH 
DRAWING PILGRIMS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
PASTORS BOB AND ARNIE HAVE COME HERE TO MINISTER TO THE THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN LUTHERANS 
WHO VISIT WITTENBERG EVERY YEAR 
BUT ON THE DAY I CAME THEY SEEMED TO BE PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY ONES HERE 
SO IS IT A PILGRIMAGE OF A TYPE 
IN A SENSE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PLACE 
IN TERMS OF THE TOTAL REFORMATION AND THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH 
IT DOES BECOME LIKE A PILGRIMAGE CENTRE 
WE MET A WOMAN FOM AUSTRALIA AND SHE SAID 
YOU'RE THE SECOND LUTHERAN PASTOR I'VE MET THIS MUST BE LIKE MECCA TO YOU FOLKS 
AND IN A WAY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WAY TO US 
I'M FROM LITTLETON COLORADO IF YOU REMEMBER THE COLUMBINE SHOOTINGS OH YES 
I WAS INVOLVED IN THE FOLLOW UP WORK OF THAT AND FOUR OF FIVE DAYS AFTER THAT HAPPENED 
WE GATHERED IN MY CHURCH AND STOOD AROUND THE BAPTISMAL FONT 
AND WE SANG A MIGHTY FORTRESS IS OUR GOD 
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES I'VE EVER HAD 
BECAUSE IT SPOKE TO YOU KNOW THE WHOLE SITUATION 
WHERE GOD IS OUR FORTRESS AND STRENGTH 
EVEN IN THE MIDST OF SOMETHING AS TRAGIC AS COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL 
THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT LUTHER COTTONED ONTO WASN'T IT 
WHEN YOU SING A HYMN IN A LARGE GROUP 
JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH IS CALLED THE FIFTH EVANGELIST 
MATTHEW MARK LUKE AND JOHN ARE THE FOUR 
AND THE IDEA IS THAT THE MUSIC TOUCHES THE SOUL 
IN THE WAY SPOKEN WORD DOES NOT 
AFTER THE WORD OF GOD IT WAS MUSIC 
IT WAS MUSIC AND BACH IS THE FIFTH EVANGELIST 
LUTHER'S IDEAS ABOUT THE ROLE OF MUSIC IN CHURCH 
HAD A HUGE INFLUENCE ON BACH 
AND ONE OF BACH'S MOST FAMOUS RELIGIOUS WORKS 
IS HIS INTERPRETATION OF A LUTHERAN CHORALE 
JESUS BLEIBET MEINE FREUDE 
MEINES HERZENS TROST UND SAFT 
JESU JOY OF MAN'S DESIRING IS NOT ONLY A BEAUTIFUL EXPRESSION OF BACH'S FAITH 
BUT FOR HARRY CHRISTOPHERS IT ALSO IS ONE OF THE FINEST EXAMPLES 
OF BACH'S MUSICAL GENIUS 
JESUS WEHRET ALLEM LEIDE 
FOR ME ONE OF THE BIGGEST ASPECTS OF BACH'S MUSIC 
IS JUST HOW MODERN HE SOUNDS 
HE STRETCHES THESE BOUNDARIES OF FORM OF WRITING 
OF THE WAY HE STRETCHES THE VOICE 
HE STRETCHES THE INSTRUMENT HE'S WRITING FOR 
HE USES EVERY DIFFERENT FORM BE IT DANCE 
BE IT OLD POLYPHONY BE IT THE CHORALE MELODIES 
IT'S THE WAY HE UTILISES EVERY MUSICAL FORM 
TURNS IT INTO HIS OWN AND MAKES IT ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE 
MEINER AUGEN LUST UND SONNE 
FROM BIRTH THE LUTHERAN CHURCH AND ITS MUSIC 
PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN BACH'S LIFE 
MEINER SEELE SCHATZ UND WONNE 
IN THE SHADOW OF WARTBURG CASTLE STANDS SAINT GEORGE'S CHURCH 
THIS IS WHERE BACH'S UNCLE JOHANN CHRISTOPH SERVED AS AN ORGANIST 
AND WHERE BACH HIMSELF WAS CHRISTENED 
IT WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT AS A CATHOLIC CHURCH 
AND HERE AS A SMALL CATHOLIC BOY LUTHER SANG IN THE CHOIR 
AND ABOVE THE DOOR IS CARVED THE NAME OF LUTHER'S FAMOUS HYMN 
BACH WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WELL 
AS A BOY HE ALSO SANG IN THE CHOIR HERE 
BACH WAS BORN INTO A VERY MUSICAL FAMILY 
OVER ONE HUNDRED OF HIS ANCESTORS AND RELATIVES 
WERE PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS OR COMPOSERS 
BACH'S FATHER WAS THE TOWN PIPER 
BUT IT WAS HIS UNCLE JOHANN CHRISTOPH 
HIMSELF A FAMOUS ORGANIST WHO TAUGHT BACH TO PLAY THE ORGAN 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS BEFORE BACH LUTHER CAME BACK HERE TO PREACH 
AND IT'S AMAZING TO THINK THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE PLACE 
WHERE BACH AS A VERY YOUNG BOY FIRST FELL IN LOVE WITH THE ORGAN 
WITH HIS UNCLE PLAYING 
THANKS TO HIS FAMILY AND THEIR EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF SCORES 
AS A CHILD BACH WAS EXPOSED TO A HUGE RANGE OF MUSICAL IDEAS 
AS WELL AS GREAT COMPOSERS OF THE DAY LIKE PACHELBEL AND FROHBURGER 
BACH WOULD HAVE HEARD COURT RELIGIOUS FOLK 
AND DANCE MUSIC FROM ACROSS EUROPE 
HE WOULD LATER DRAW UPON ALL THESE INFLUENCES AND INCORPORATE THEM INTO HIS OWN MUSIC 
WHEN HE WAS FOURTEEN BACH WON A CHORAL SCHOLARSHIP 
TO THE PRESTIGIOUS SAINT MICHAEL'S SCHOOL IN LUNEBERG JUST OUTSIDE HAMBURG 
FOR TWO YEARS NOT ONLY WOULD HE HAVE SUNG IN ONE OF THE BEST CHOIRS 
BUT HE ALSO WOULD HAVE HEARD SOME OF THE FINEST INSTRUMENTS OF THE TIME 
SHORTLY AFTER GRADUATING FROM SAINT MICHAEL'S BACH BEGAN WORK ON HIS CANTATA NUMBER FOUR 
BASED ON THE LUTHERAN HYMN CHRIST LAG IN TODESBANDEN CHRIST LAY IN DEATH'S BONDS 
IT SHOWS HOW QUICKLY BACH HAD MASTERED WRITING 
FOR BOTH VOICE AND INSTRUMENTS 
HE WAS JUST TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD WHEN HE WROTE IT 
IN HIS OWN LIFETIME BACH DIDN'T ALWAYS GET TO WORK WITH THE FINEST MUSICIANS 
HE WOULD FREQUENTLY STRUGGLE TO GET ENOUGH MONEY 
TO PERFORM MANY OF HIS RELIGIOUS PIECES AS HE ENVISAGED THEM 
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HOWEVER HAD A VERY DIFFERENT ATTITUDE TO MONEY 
AT THE START OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
ROME WAS FILLED WITH SOME OF THE GRANDEST AND MOST EXPENSIVE CHURCHES AND BASILICAS IN THE WORLD 
AND IN APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTEEN POPE LEO X. DECIDED TO BUILD ONE 
THAT WOULD OUTSHINE THEM ALL 
THIS 
SAINT PETER'S BASILICA IN THE HEART OF THE VATICAN 
BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO USE THE CHURCH'S MONEY TO PAY FOR IT 
SO THE POPE DESPATCHED A DOMINICAN FRIAR JOHN TETZEL TO GERMANY 
WHERE HE WAS TO SELL INDULGENCES IN ORDER TO RAISE THE MONEY 
AN INDULGENCE WAS GRANTED WHEN A SINNER CONFESSED HIS OR HER SINS 
AND RECEIVED ABSOLUTION 
THE IDEA WAS THAT BY GRANTING AN INDULGENCE 
THE CHURCH EXTENDED A MERIT FROM ITS TREASURE HOUSE OF MERITS 
THAT IS GOOD DEEDS ACCUMULATED BY THE SAINTS 
AND THESE MERITS OR CREDITS COULD BE BOUGHT AND SOLD 
IT WAS A LITTLE LIKE BUYING AN INSURANCE POLICY FOR THE AFTERLIFE 
BUT ONE POPE LEO X. KNEW THE CHURCH WOULD NEVER HAVE TO PAY MONEY OUT ON 
AND WHEN JOHN TETZEL SAID AS SOON AS THE COIN IN THE COFFER RINGS 
THE SOUL FROM PURGATORY SPRINGS MARTIN LUTHER REACTED WITH FURY 
AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED ONLY GOD COULD GRANT FORGIVENESS 
AND IT CERTAINLY COULD NOT BE BOUGHT AND SOLD 
EVEN IF THE POPE DID WANT TO BUILD THE BIGGEST CHURCH IN CHRISTENDOM 
LUTHER WROTE 
WHY DOES NOT THE POPE WHOSE WEALTH TODAY 
IS GREATER THAN THE RICHEST CRASSUS 
BUILD THE BASILICA OF SAINT PETER WITH HIS OWN MONEY 
RATHER THAN WITH THE MONEY OF POOR BELIEVERS 
IN FACT LUTHER WROTE DOWN A FEW OTHER THINGS 
THAT INFURIATED HIM ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
AND HE SENT HIS LIST OF GRIEVANCES TO THE POPE'S SENIOR REPRESENTATIVE IN GERMANY 
ALBERT ARCHBISHOP OF MAINZ AND MAGDEBURG 
BUT LUTHER DIDN'T JUST WRITE TO THE ARCHBISHOP 
HE NAILED A FULL LIST OF HIS COMPLAINTS 
TO THE DOOR OF THIS CHURCH 
THIS IS THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY EQUIVALENT OF PUTTING IT ON THE INTERNET 
LUTHER'S NINETY FIVE THESES AS THEY BECAME KNOWN 
WOULD THANKS TO THE NEWLY INVENTED PRINTING PRESS 
SPREAD THROUGHOUT EUROPE 
BUT THEY APPEARED HERE FIRST NAILED TO THIS CHURCH DOOR 
THIS IS WHERE IN EFFECT THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION BEGAN 
LUTHER'S ACTIONS WOULD HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON EUROPEAN HISTORY 
YET IN MANY WAYS 
THE START OF THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION 
HERALDED A GRADUAL CHANGE RATHER THAN A SUDDEN SPLIT 
WITH THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 
AND THIS WAS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF SACRED MUSIC 
WHEN TWO CENTURIES LATER BACH WROTE HIS CHRISTMAS ORATORIO 
FOR THE CATHOLIC PRINCE FRIEDRICH THE ELECTOR OF SAXONY 
HE WAS STILL DRAWING HEAVILY 
WHICH HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 
WIE SOLL ICH DICH EMPFANGEN 
UND WIE BEGEGN ICH DIR 
O. ALLER WELT VERLANGEN 
O. MEINER SEELE ZIER 
O. JESU JESU SETZE 
MIR SELBST DIE FACKEL BEI 
DAMIT WAS DICH ERGOTZE 
MIR KUND UND WISSEND SEI 
LUTHER HIMSELF LOVED A LOT OF CATHOLIC MUSIC 
AND IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN WHEN HE SENT HIS NINETY FIVE THESES TO THE POPE 
IT WAS NEVER HIS INTENTION TO DIVIDE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
OR BREAK WITH ITS MUSICAL TRADITIONS 
AS LUTHER SAT BACK AND WAITED FOR THE POPE TO RESPOND 
HE HAD NO IDEA HIS LIST OF GRIEVANCES 
WOULD RESULT IN A DEATH SENTENCE 
MEANWHILE SIX HUNDRED MILES AWAY IN BAVARIA 
THE COMPOSER LUDWIG SENFL WAS BEMOANING THE LOSS OF HIS TOE 
IN A FREAK HUNTING ACCIDENT 
SENFL DIDN'T KNOW IT THEN 
BORN IN SWITZERLAND IN AROUND ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX 
SENFL SPENT VIRTUALLY ALL HIS WORKING LIFE IN GERMANY 
IT SEEMS HE WAS AN ECLECTIC COMPOSER 
AND A MAN THAT ENJOYED THE FINER THINGS IN LIFE 
AS WELL AS PRODUCING A WIDE VARIETY OF RELIGIOUS WORKS 
LIKE MANY COMPOSERS OF HIS DAY 
SENFL RELIED ON THE ARISTOCRACY FOR EMPLOYMENT 
AND IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN HE LANDED A JOB AS COURT COMPOSER TO MAXIMILIAN I 
HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR IN AUGSBURG 
IN HIS MID TWENTIES HE TRAVELLED TO ITALY 
WHERE THE FRENCH AND DUTCH POLYPHONIC STYLES 
WERE TAKING THE LATE FIFTEENTH CENTURY MUSIC SCENE BY STORM 
AND HE BROUGHT THOSE IDEAS BACK WITH HIM TO GERMANY 
APART FROM THE LOSS OF HIS TOE THINGS WERE GOING WELL FOR HIM 
THAT IS UNTIL ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETEEN WHEN THE EMPEROR DIED 
AND SENFL HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO HOBBLE OFF IN SEARCH OF WORK 
IN ROME LUTHER'S ADVERSARY 
POPE LEO X. WAS TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE NINETY FIVE THESES 
HE HOPED THE WHOLE NASTY BUSINESS WOULD DIE DOWN OF ITS OWN ACCORD 
DESCRIBING LUTHER AS A DRUNKEN GERMAN WHO WHEN SOBER WOULD CHANGE HIS MIND 
BUT HE WAS WRONG 
LUTHER STOOD RESOLUTELY BY HIS WRITINGS 
SO ON THE FIFTEENTH OF JUNE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY 
POPE LEO THREATENED LUTHER WITH EXCOMMUNICATION FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
UNLESS HE STARTED BEHAVING HIMSELF 
WHEN LUTHER RECEIVED 
HE VERY PUBLICLY AND OSTENTATIOUSLY BURNED IT 
THE FOLLOWING SPRING LUTHER WAS SUMMONED TO A MEETING 
WITH THE BIG GUNS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
TO DETERMINE HIS FATE 
ON THE SEVENTEENTH OF APRIL ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE 
LUTHER CAME BEFORE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE ESTATES OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE 
OR WHAT BECAME KNOWN AS THE DIET OF WORMS 
AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM SAT THE NINE TOED COMPOSER SENFL 
HE LISTENED AS THE ARCHBISHOP OF TRIER PRESENTED LUTHER WITH HIS WRITINGS 
ASKING IF HE WERE THE AUTHOR 
AND IF HE STOOD BY THEIR CONTENTS 
YES REPLIED LUTHER THEY WERE HIS WRITINGS 
UNLESS I SHALL BE CONVINCED BY THE TESTIMONIES OF THE SCRIPTURES OR BY CLEAR REASON 
I NEITHER CAN NOR WILL MAKE ANY RETRACTION 
SINCE IT IS NEITHER SAFE NOR HONOURABLE TO ACT AGAINST CONSCIENCE 
FOR FIVE DAYS SENFL LISTENED TO LUTHER'S DEFENCE 
AND WHEN THE EMPEROR PRESENTED THE FINAL EDICT OF WORMS 
SENFL LIKE MANY PEOPLE PRESENT 
MUST HAVE BEEN DISMAYED AT THE RESULT 
THE EDICT DECLARED LUTHER AN OUTLAW BANNED ALL HIS WRITINGS 
AND DEMANDED HIS ARREST 
WE WANT HIM TO BE APPREHENDED AND PUNISHED AS A NOTORIOUS HERETIC 
SAID THE ASSEMBLY 
THEY MADE IT A CRIME FOR ANYONE IN GERMANY TO GIVE LUTHER FOOD AND SHELTER 
AND FINALLY THEY ALLOWED ANYONE TO KILL HIM 
WITHOUT LEGAL CONSEQUENCE 
THE TRIAL MUST HAVE MADE A HUGE IMPACT ON SENFL 
AND ALTHOUGH HE REMAINED IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
A FEW YEARS LATER HE AND LUTHER ENTERED CORRESPONDENCE 
SENFL WROTE A COUPLE OF MOTETS FOR LUTHER 
OF WHICH LUTHER LATER SAID 
I COULD NEVER WRITE SUCH A MOTET EVEN IF I TORE MYSELF TO PIECES 
ECCE QUAM BONUM BY LUDWIG SENFL 
IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH MOTETS ARE DEVELOPED AS SHORT CHORAL WORKS 
THAT COULD BE USED AS A PART OF ANY SERVICE 
AND LUTHER WAS PARTICULARLY FOND OF THEM 
TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER BACH WROTE HIS LUTHERAN MOTET SINGET DEM HERRN 
AND BY DECONSTRUCTING IT 
WE CAN SEE HOW BACH TOOK THIS MUSICAL FORM TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL 
HARRY THIS IS ONE OF BACH'S MOTETS HE WROTE ABOUT 
SIX HALF A DOZEN 
WHEN WOULD THIS BE PERFORMED THIS PARTICULAR ONE WAS PERFORMED FOR NEW YEAR 
RIGHT IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN RIGHT 
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT BACH WROTE IT 
TO ACTUALLY TRAIN HIS STUDENTS HIS SINGERS 
IN THE ARTS OF VOCAL TECHNIQUES AND INDEED OF MUSICAL FORM 
SO WE'D HOPE THAT HE DISPLAYS ALMOST EVERY SINGLE TECHNIQUE 
HE DOES IT'S AN INCREDIBLE WORK FULL OF SURPRISES 
I'LL JUST DO THE OPENING IN CHOIR TWO SINGET DEM HERRN 
IT'S IN TWO CHOIRS SO WE HAVE FOUR SINGERS SINGING ONE BIT AND FOUR 
SOPRANO ALTO TENOR BASS IN EACH CHOIR CHOIR TWO HE STARTS WITH JUST SINGET TWO SYLLABLES 
SINGET SINGET 
BUT OVER THAT THE FIRST CHOIR THE SOPRANO ALTO AND TENOR DO AN EMBELLISHMENT OF IT 
A VERY EMBELLISHED PHRASE WITH THE BASS ON THE DRONE THE LONG HELD NOTE 
SINGET SINGET 
SO IT'S INCREDIBLY ACTIVE ISN'T IT THIS CHOIR GIVES THEM BALLAST 
THIS CHOIR GIVE THE RHYTHM AND OFF THEY BOUNCE LET'S PUT IT TOGETHER 
SINGET SINGET 
VERY SIMPLE TECHNIQUE IN THE HANDS OF A MASTER IT'S BRILLIANT 
AND THERE'S MORE HE SHOWS OFF IN THIS PIECE ISN'T THERE 
HE CERTAINLY HAS HE'S DONE THE DOUBLE CHOIR 
AND NOW HE SPRINGS THE FINAL SURPRISE ON US 
HE BRINGS IN ONE OF HIS FAMOUS FUGUES 
SO HE'S NOW DISPLAYED ALL THESE TECHNIQUES FOR HIS PUPILS 
SO HE SAYS COPY ME 
SINGET DEM HERRN EIN NEUES LIED BY JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH 
FOR ALL OF HIS RELIGIOUS WORK 
BACH WOULD METICULOUSLY REFER TO LUTHER'S TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE 
IN FACT HE OWNED NOT ONE BUT TWO COMPLETE EDITIONS 
WHEN LUTHER'S BIBLE WAS PUBLISHED IT BECAME AN INSTANT BESTSELLER MAKING LUTHER A CELEBRITY 
PUBLISHED IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO LUTHER'S TRANSLATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT 
SOLD AN ASTONISHING FIVE THOUSAND COPIES IN JUST TWO MONTHS 
PRESUMABLY FLUSHED WITH SUCCESS 
HE RETURNED HOME HERE TO WITTENBERG 
WHILST HE WAS HERE HE HEARD THAT A DOZEN NUNS AT A NEARBY CONVENT 
HAD BECOME DISILLUSIONED WITH THE CATHOLIC FAITH 
AND SO HE ARRANGED FOR THEM TO ESCAPE 
AFTER A DELIVERY OF PICKLED FISH 
THE NUNS WERE SMUGGLED OUT OF THE CONVENT 
HIDDEN IN EMPTY HERRING BARRELS AND BROUGHT TO WITTENBERG 
THEN RATHER UNEXPECTEDLY LUTHER FELL IN LOVE WITH ONE OF THEM 
SUDDENLY AND WHILE I WAS OCCUPIED WITH FAR OTHER THOUGHTS 
HE WROTE TO A FRIEND 
THE LORD HAS PLUNGED ME INTO MARRIAGE 
KATHARINA WAS TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD 
AND LUTHER WAS FORTY TWO 
A CENTURY AND A HALF LATER MARRIAGE WAS ALSO ON BACH'S MIND 
OR MORE PRECISELY HE WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW TO AVOID IT 
AFTER GRADUATING FROM SAINT MICHAEL'S SCHOOL 
HE SPENT A SHORT SPELL AS A COURT MUSICIAN IN WEIMAR 
AND THEN AS HIS REPUTATION AS A KEYBOARD PLAYER GREW 
HE LANDED A BETTER PAID JOB HERE IN ARNSTADT 
AS ORGANIST OF SAINT BONIFACE'S CHURCH 
THIS IS THE ORGAN HE WOULD HAVE PLAYED EVERY SUNDAY 
ALTHOUGH NOT FOR LONG HE SOON FELL OUT WITH HIS EMPLOYERS 
ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE SINGERS IN THE CHOIR 
AND SO IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIVE HE WALKED OUT 
AND THE YOUNG BACH WALKED AND HE WALKED 
AND HE WALKED 
HALFWAY ACROSS GERMANY 
BACH WALKED SOME TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILES 
HE REACHED THE SMALL TOWN OF LUBECK FAMOUS FOR ITS SEVEN SPIRES 
LUBECK WAS FAMOUS FOR A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL 
FIRSTLY DURING A SIEGE 
WHEN THE TOWN HAD NOTHING TO EAT BUT ALMONDS AND SUGAR 
A LOCAL BAKER HERE INVENTED MARZIPAN 
SECONDLY LUBECK WAS HOME TO THE MOST INFLUENTIAL ORGANIST OF HIS DAY 
DIETRICH BUXTEHUDE 
AND THIS IS WHERE BUXTEHUDE WORKED FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE 
AT THE MARIENKIRCHE ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHURCHES IN ALL OF GERMANY 
BACH HAD COME HALFWAY ACROSS GERMANY TO HEAR BUXTEHUDE PLAY THIS 
AS THE CHURCH ORGANIST HERE IT WASN'T JUST BUXTEHUDE'S JOB TO PLAY 
HE ALSO HAD TO WRITE A LOT OF THE MUSIC 
THE USE OF ORGAN MUSIC WITHIN SERVICES 
HAD BEEN ONE OF LUTHER'S MANY INNOVATIONS 
I'M STRUCK BY JUST HOW MUCH MUSIC THERE IS THERE'S A LOT OF MUSIC 
INCLUDING QUITE A LOT OF ORGAN MUSIC IT MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO DO 
WITH THE IDEA THAT LUTHER HIMSELF LOVED MUSIC 
AND SO THE ORGAN BECAME VERY FAMOUS AND IN THE LUTHERAN TRADITION 
THE ORGAN MUSIC BECAME A VERY STRONG FORCE 
THERE'S AN INTERLUDE THERE'S SOMETHING TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK 
ABOUT THE WORDS THEY'VE HEARD AND LET THEM GET MIXED 
WITH ANOTHER FORM OF PIETY OR BELIEF 
ONE OF BUXTEHUDE'S INNOVATIONS WAS ESTABLISHING EVENING CONCERTS HERE 
ABENDMUSIK AND PEOPLE WOULD COME FROM FAR AND WIDE TO THIS CHURCH 
JUST FOR THE MUSIC 
BUXTEHUDE MUST HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE TWENTY YEAR OLD BACH 
BECAUSE HE OFFERED HIM HIS JOB AS ORGANIST HERE AT THE MARIENKIRCHE 
IT CAME WITH A CONDITION HOWEVER 
BACH WOULD HAVE TO MARRY BUXTEHUDE'S DAUGHTER 
HE DECLINED INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH BUXTEHUDE OFFERED THE SAME DEAL 
TO ANOTHER FAMOUS GERMAN COMPOSER HANDEL 
AND HE TOO TURNED DOWN THE POSITION 
BUT BACH AND INDEED HANDEL HADN'T COME HERE FOR MARRIAGE 
OR INDEED FOR A JOB THEY'D COME TO HERE BUXTEHUDE'S MUSIC 
THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO BUXTEHUDE MUST HAVE MADE A HUGE IMPACT ON YOUNG BACH 
AT AROUND THIS TIME THE FAMOUS TOCCATA AND FUGUE IN D. MINOR WAS WRITTEN 
SINCE THEN IT'S ATTRIBUTED TO BACH 
BUT AS THE STYLE IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM HIS OTHER WORK 
SOME QUESTION WHETHER HE ACTUALLY WROTE IT 
TOCCATA AND FUGUE IN D. MINOR BY JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH 
IN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS BUXTEHUDE HAS ONLY HAD NINE SUCCESSORS 
AND THE MAN TO HOLD THE POST CURRENTLY IS PROFESSOR ERNST ERICH STENDER 
PROFESSOR THAT WAS AMAZING TO HEAR THAT AND ON BUXTEHUDE'S ORGAN 
AND THIS IS YOUR WIFE HILDEGARD 
THE TOCCATA AND FUGUE IN D. MINOR SOME PEOPLE DON'T THINK IS BY BACH 
SO I JUST WONDERED WHAT YOU FELT WAS RIGHT 
IS IT BY BACH OR NOT 
HE THINKS IT IS DEFNITELY BACH 
WHY DID ANYBODY EVER PROPOSE THAT IT WASN'T BY BACH 
BUXTEHUDE DO YOU FEEL HIM AROUND THE CHURCH DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HISTORY 
HE DID ONE THING THAT WE KNOW OF WHICH IS THAT HE SAID TO BACH 
I'LL GIVE YOU THE JOB IF YOU MARRY MY DAUGHTER 
DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE DAUGHTER YES SHE WAS NOT VERY NICE 
OLD TEN YEARS OLDER THAN BACH TEN YEARS OLDER 
I COULDN'T RESIST WHEN PROFESSOR STENDER GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO PLAY BUXTEHUDE'S ORGAN 
IS IT A G. SHARP 
YES IT IS A G. SHARP YEAH 
BUXTEHUDE'S ORGAN WHAT CAN YOU SAY REALLY 
PROFESSOR STENDER HAS BEEN THE ORGANIST AT THE MARIENKIRCHE 
FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS BUT ORGAN TUNER HERR SCHUMANN 
HAS WORKED HERE TWICE AS LONG 
HERR SCHUMANN HOW MANY PIPES IN THIS ORGAN 
EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY PIPES 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS JOB HERR SCHUMANN 
SIXTY YEARS 
HE REMEMBERS TUNING BUXTEHUDE'S ORIGINAL ORGAN 
SADLY IT WAS BADLY DAMAGED DURING THE WAR 
AND THE CURRENT ORGAN WAS INSTALLED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
WITH PIPES RANGING FROM TEN M. M. TO A STAGGERING THIRTY M. LONG 
THE ORGAN IS THE SIZE OF TWO FOUR BEDROOMED HOUSES 
AND IT'S ALL SUSPENDED TWENTY FIVE M. ABOVE THE CHURCH FLOOR 
SO YOU GO BY LADDER 
FROM HERE UP TO THERE 
BIT DANGEROUS 
IT'S IMPRESSIVE NOW BUT FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
WHEN BACH AND BUXTEHUDE WERE HERE CHURCH ORGANS LIKE THIS 
WERE THE BIGGEST AND THE MOST COMPLEX MACHINES OF THEIR TIME 
IT'S AMAZING IT'S LIKE A LANDSCAPE ISN'T IT 
AND LOOK AT THE VIEW 
AFTER STUDYING FOR FOUR MONTHS WITH BUXTEHUDE 
BACH STILL A BACHELOR RETURNED TO HIS OLD POST IN WEIMAR 
HE DIDN'T STAY FOR LONG HE MOVED FROM JOB TO JOB 
BUT HE DID FIND A WIFE AND SOON AFTER 
HE FATHERED THE FIRST OF HIS TWENTY CHILDREN 
OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS BACH WROTE COMPARATIVELY FEW RELIGIOUS WORKS 
HIS EMPLOYER PRINCE LEOPOLD WAS A CALVINIST 
WHO APPARENTLY PREFERRED SIMPLER CHURCH MUSIC TO THAT OF BACH'S 
HOWEVER BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHT AND ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN HE BEGAN WRITING THE LITTLE ORGAN BOOK 
FOR HIS ELDEST SON WILHELM FRIEDEMANN 
IT USES FORTY FIVE TRADITIONAL LUTHERAN CHORALES OR HYMN TUNES 
TO CREATE A SORT OF ORGANIST'S HANDBOOK 
THE ORGELBUCHLEIN THE LITTLE ORGAN BOOK WAS ORIGINALLY MEANT 
TO BE A SET OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE CHORALE PRELUDES 
SMALL COMPOSITIONS BASED ON THE CHORALE MELODIES 
WHICH SPANNED THE ENTIRE CHRISTIAN YEAR 
THIS WONDERFUL BOOK ILLUSTRATES TWO MAJOR THEMES IN BACH'S LIFE 
FIRSTLY HIS LOVE OF TEACHING 
AND SECONDLY HIS LOVE OF THE CHORALE AS A MUSICAL FORM 
HE DEDICATED THE BOOK TO THE HONOUR OF THE MOST HIGH GOD ALONE 
AND THEN HE WROTE TO THE NEXT ONE THAT HE MAY LEARN OUT OF IT 
IT MAY BE SURPRISING TO US NOW BUT IN HIS OWN LIFETIME 
MANY OF BACH'S CONTEMPORARIES THOUGHT HIS MUSIC 
TO BE OLD FASHIONED AND OUT OF DATE 
HOWEVER EVEN WITH A SIMPLE TEACHING AID LIKE THE LITTLE ORGAN BOOK 
BACH WAS ABLE TO TAKE COMPLEX MUSICAL IDEAS 
AND EXPRESS THEM SO SIMPLY THAT A CHILD COULD UNDERSTAND THEM 
IT'S SAID THAT BACH INVENTED NOTHING 
SO WHY IS HE CONSIDERED A MUSICAL GENIUS 
WELL HE WAS UNLIKE ME A VIRTUOSO PLAYER 
BUT PERHAPS HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT 
IS BRINGING TOGETHER SO MANY IDEAS DEVELOPED BY HIS PREDECESSORS 
HE MAY NOT HAVE INTRODUCED ANY NEW FORMS 
BUT IT'S BACH'S MASTERFUL CONTROL OF HARMONY 
THAT SETS HIM HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST 
WHEN HE PUTS TWO OR THREE VOICES TOGETHER 
THEY NOT ONLY HARMONISE WELL 
BUT EACH INDIVIDUAL LINE IS A THING OF BEAUTY AND ELEGANCE 
PUT TOGETHER THEY TOUCH THE DIVINE 
AND THAT MAYBE IS BACH'S GENIUS 
ICH WILL HIER BEI DIR STEHEN 
VERACHTE MICH DOCH NICHT 
VON DIR WILL ICH NICHT GEHEN 
WENN DIR DEIN HERZE BRICHT 
THE SAINT MATTHEW PASSION IS ONE OF THE FINEST EXAMPLES OF BACH'S GENIUS 
NOT ONLY IS THE SOUND DISTINCTLY HIS 
BUT BACH ALSO CONSOLIDATES A CENTURY AND A HALF OF MUSICAL IDEAS 
DEVELOPED BY HIS NOW OFTEN OVERLOOKED PREDECESSORS 
ALSDENN WILL ICH DICH FASSEN 
IN MEINEN ARM UND SCHOSS 
BACH HAS BECOME SUCH A TOWERING FIGURE IN WESTERN MUSIC 
THAT IT'S SOMETIMES EASY TO FORGET OR TO DISMISS 
THOSE GERMAN COMPOSERS WHO CAME JUST BEFORE HIM 
JOHANN SCHEIN WAS ONE OF A TRIO OF COMPOSERS 
I LEARNT ABOUT AT SCHOOL THEY CAME AS A PACKAGE 
THE SECOND WAS HIS LIFELONG FRIEND KNOWN AS THE FATHER OF GERMAN MUSIC 
HEINRICH SCHUTZ AND THE THIRD WAS A MAN WHO GLORIED IN THE NAME 
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ENGLISH SPEAKERS OF SAMUEL SCHEIDT 
SCHEIN WAS THE MUSIC DIRECTOR HERE AT THE THOMASKIRCHE IN LEIPZIG 
SCHEIN ALONG WITH HIS FRIEND SCHUTZ 
WERE AMONG THE FIRST GERMAN COMPOSERS TO USE THE VENETIAN POLYCHORAL STYLE 
IN LUTHERAN CHURCH MUSIC 
THE IDEA OF USING TWO CHOIRS HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN INSPIRED 
BY THE WAY SOUND ECHOED AROUND VAST ITALIAN BASILICAS 
AND SCHEIN WAS ABLE TO REPRODUCE THIS TECHNIQUE 
WITH GREAT EFFECT IN GERMANY 
WHILE HIS FRIEND SCHUTZ MADE SEVERAL TRIPS TO ITALY 
SCHEIN APPARENTLY SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE IN GERMANY 
MAKING HIS GRASP OF THE ITALIANATE STYLE MORE EXTRAORDINARY 
SCHEIN AND SCHUTZ WOULD HAVE A BIG INFLUENCE ON THE GERMAN SCHOOL 
AND ON COMPOSERS LIKE BUXTEHUDE 
BUT THE MAN WHO BROUGHT ALL THESE IDEAS SO SPECTACULARLY TOGETHER 
WAS JS BACH 
JESU DER DU MEINE SEELE BY JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH 
THIS IS THE WORLD FAMOUS BOYS' CHOIR OF THE THOMANERSCHULE IN LEIPZIG 
THEY'RE REHEARSING ONE OF BACH'S MANY LUTHERAN CHORALES 
FROM HIS CANTATA NUMBER SEVENTY EIGHT 
IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY THREE BACH TOOK THE SAME JOB AT THE THOMANERSCHULE 
THAT SCHEIN HAD HELD ALMOST A CENTURY BEFORE 
THIS REQUIRED HIM NOT ONLY TO INSTRUCT THE STUDENTS OF THE SCHOOL IN SINGING 
BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE WEEKLY MUSIC FOR THE TWO MAIN CHURCHES IN LEIPZIG 
THE THOMASKIRCHE HERE AND THE NICHOLASKIRCHE 
AS WELL AS TWO SMALLER CHURCHES 
TODAY THE THOMANERSCHULE CHOIR IS IN MANY WAYS STILL RUN 
AS IT WAS IN BACH'S TIME 
I'M SITTING HERE AT THE THOMANERSCHULE 
WHICH IS THE SCHOOL ATTACHED TO THE THOMASKIRCHE 
WHICH IS WHERE BACH TRAINED UP HIS SINGERS 
TEACHING WAS ONE OF BACH'S GREAT PASSIONS IN LIFE 
BUT IN ADDITION HE ALSO HAD TO PRODUCE A VAST AMOUNT OF NEW MUSIC EVERY WEEK 
IN AN ASTONISHING BURST OF CREATIVITY 
BACH WROTE FIVE ANNUAL CANTATA CYCLES 
IN HIS FIRST SIX YEARS IN LEIPZIG 
MANY OF THE PIECES BACH WROTE FOR THE CHURCH WOULD SERVE A DUAL PURPOSE 
AND HE FREQUENTLY USED THEM TO TRAIN HIS CHOIR IN DIFFERENT VOCAL TECHNIQUES 
TODAY THE CHOIR IS EIGHTY STRONG 
BUT FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT WAS MUCH SMALLER 
AND BACH WOULD RARELY GET TO PERFORM MANY OF HIS BIG RELIGIOUS WORKS AS HE CONCEIVED THEM 
AND THIS WOULD FREQUENTLY BRING BACH INTO CONFLICT WITH HIS EMPLOYER 
THE CHURCH COUNCIL 
THE COUNCIL PROVIDED ONLY EIGHT PERMANENT INSTRUMENTALISTS 
WHICH WAS WHICH WAS ALWAYS A SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION FOR BACH 
WHO HAD TO RECRUIT THE REST OF THE TWENTY OR SO PLAYERS 
WHEREVER HE COULD FIND THEM 
MONEY WAS ALWAYS TIGHT AND BACH WOULD PERSUADE HIS CHOIR 
TO PERFORM AT ADDITIONAL CHURCH SERVICES 
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE NOW BUT IN THOSE DAYS 
YOU COULD BOOK BACH FOR YOUR WEDDING 
UND SINGEN HALLELUJA 
HALLELUJA 
DURING HIS TIME IN LEIPZIG 
BACH REVISITED MANY OF HIS EARLIER PIECES 
TRANSFORMING WORKS HE WROTE IN HIS YOUTH 
SUCH AS CHRIST LAG IN TODES BANDEN 
WITH THE ADDITION OF NEW INSTRUMENTAL SECTIONS 
IT WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY WAY BACH EVER THE PRAGMATIST 
COULD DELIVER NEW MUSIC FOR FOUR CHURCHES ON AN ALMOST WEEKELY BASIS 
AND ASTONISHINGLY BACH KEPT UP THIS PHENOMENAL OUTPUT FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS 
UNTIL ILL HEALTH FINALLY GROUND THIS ONE MAN MUSIC FACTORY TO A HALT 
HALLELUJA HALLELUJA 
IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY BACH'S HEALTH DETERIORATED 
HE SUFFERED SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH HIS EYESIGHT 
AND DESPITE BEING OPERATED ON BY AN EMINENT BRITISH SURGEON 
HE DIED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS 
HE WAS SIXTY FIVE 
IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE ESTEEM IN WHICH WE HOLD BACH TODAY 
HE WAS BURIED HERE IN AN UNMARKED GRAVE 
ALTHOUGH HE WAS A FAITHFUL SERVANT OF THE CHURCH FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE 
BACH WASN'T CONSIDERED IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO BE GIVEN A HEADSTONE 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FOUR AFTER DIGGING UP FORTY SEVEN GRAVES TO FIND HIS REMAINS 
BACH WAS FORMALLY RE BURIED THEN AFTER THE WAR 
HE WAS FINALLY LAID TO REST HERE IN THE THOMASKIRCHE 
IN FRONT OF THE ALTAR OF THE CHURCH HE DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO 
MY JOURNEY THROUGH THE EARLY HISTORY OF SACRED MUSIC 
BEGAN IN MEDIEVAL PARIS AND HAS TAKEN ME ACROSS EUROPE 
AND THROUGH CENTURIES OF MUSICAL DEVELOPMENT 
I'VE BEEN TO SOME OF THE MOST AWE INSPIRING PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE WORLD 
AND I'VE MET MANY FASCINATING PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE KEPT THIS GLORIOUS MUSIC ALIVE 
BUT ABOVE ALL I'VE SENSED IN THIS MUSIC 
WHICH TRANSCENDS MAN'S EARTHLY WORRIES 
THAT THERE'S REMAINED AN UNBROKEN LINE OF COMPOSERS WHO LIKE BACH 
MADE WRITING FOR THE CHURCH THEIR PRIMARY AMBITION 
BUT BACH WAS BOTH A BEGINNING AND AN END 
AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY 
EUROPE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF ANOTHER REVOLUTION 
A REVOLUTION EVEN MORE FAR REACHING THAN LUTHER'S 
NEW IDEAS IN COMMERCE 
POLITICS AND INDUSTRY WOULD CHANGE THE ENTIRE WORLD 
AND MUSIC TOO 
BUT IN THIS NEW WORLD BACH'S MUSIC ENDURED 
WHEN NASA SENT VOYAGER ONE INTO OUTER SPACE 
THEY CHOSE HIS MUSIC TO REPRESENT HUMAN BEINGS 
TO WHOEVER OR WHATEVER THEY MIGHT FIND 
AND WHEN YOU LISTEN TO BACH TO THIS PROFOUNDLY SPIRITUAL MUSIC 
THERE'S ALWAYS A FEELING THAT SOMEONE ELSE TOO IS LISTENING
