JUST ONE WEEK AWAY FROM THE SPRING EQUINOX 
THE OFFICIAL START OF SPRING 
WE'RE HERE IN THE WEST COUNTRY AT MY HOME GLEBE COTTAGE 
THIS IS THE VERY VERY BEST TIME OF DAY 
IT'S DAWN 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO GARDENERS' WORLD 
AN HOUR OF HORTICULTURAL THERAPY ON A FRIDAY NIGHT 
SPRING MIGHT OFFICIALLY BE A WEEK AWAY BUT HERE IN THE WEST COUNTRY 
IT'S WELL AND TRULY ARRIVED 
THANKS TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE GULF STREAM WE WARM UP QUICKLY HERE 
YOU CAN ALMOST SMELL SPRING IN THE AIR 
THIS WHOLE PLACE IS FULL OF A SENSE OF ANTICIPATION 
I FOR ONE CAN'T WAIT TO GET STARTED 
ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
WE'LL BE TAKING A SHORT TRIP OFF LAND'S END 
TO VISIT THE SCILLY ISLES WHERE THE EARLY MILD CLIMATE 
HAD LED TO A BLOSSOMING BUSINESS FOR GROWERS OF THE SEASON'S MOST ICONIC CUT FLOWER THE NARCISSUS 
WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THE BULB DISPLAYS AT ONE OF THE WEST COUNTRY'S BIGGEST ATTRACTIONS 
THE EDEN PROJECT 
AND IN FURTHER CELEBRATION OF THE AREA 
LOOKING AT SOME OF THE FINEST GARDENS TO VISIT THROUGH THE SEASON 
I'LL BE IN MY GARDEN KICK STARTING THOSE JOBS TO BE GETTING ON WITH NOW 
PLANNING AHEAD FOR SUMMER AND BEYOND 
TO ME THE PRIMROSE EPITOMISES SPRING 
IT'S EVERYWHERE HERE IN DEVON 
BUT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I WENT TO A SPECIAL LOCATION 
A PRIVATE WOODED VALLEY IN SOUTH DEVON 
A LOT OF THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN 
INCLUDING THE COLOUR OF MY HAIR 
BUT THE PRIMROSES HAVE PROBABLY BEEN THERE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
WITH ITS SPECTACULAR COASTLINE 
GLORIOUS ROLLING COUNTRYSIDE AND RICH TAPESTRY OF HEDGEROWS AND WOODLANDS 
DEVON IS A JEWEL IN THE NATION'S LANDSCAPE 
I CAME HERE TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO 
AND EVERY MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP I THANK MY LUCKY STARS 
I'M IN ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACES IN THE WORLD 
WE'VE GOT A MILD CLIMATE HERE AND THOUGH IT DOES GET A BIT DAMP 
THAT'S WHY IN MARCH AND APRIL WE HAVE SUCH AN ABUNDANCE OF OUR COUNTY FLOWER 
THE WILD PRIMROSE 
I ADORE PRIMROSES 
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THEM 
IT'S THIS LOVELY PALE LEMON FLOWER 
ALL STANDING ON TOP OF THIS LOVELY PINK STEM 
PALE PINK THE COLOUR OF MOUSE TAILS 
AND THE WAY THEY CLUMP SO JOYOUSLY AND ANNOUNCE SPRING AS SOON AS YOU SEE THEM 
THEY JUST SAY SPRING'S ARRIVED 
ANOTHER PRIMROSE FAN WAS THE REVEREND KEBLE MARTIN 
WHO PAINTED THEM FOR HIS CLASSIC THE CONCISE BRITISH FLORA IN COLOUR 
KEBLE MARTIN PAINTED MANY OF HIS FLOWER PICTURES HERE AT CHURCH FARM IN SOUTH DEVON 
IT'S A HERITAGE THAT'S GREATLY VALUED BY ITS PRESENT OWNER 
NATURALIST AND FILMMAKER ANDREW COOPER 
WHAT A PERFECT SETTING FOR THESE PRIMROSES 
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN THEM IN SUCH PROFUSION 
AND THEY SEEM TO BE INCREASING YEAR ON YEAR 
EVERY YEAR THERE'S MORE AND MORE HERE 
YEAH BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE 
NO FAR FROM IT 
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES MOST OF THE PRIMROSES IN DEVON 
STARTED DISAPPEARING VERY FAST 
IT WAS A PAPERMILL APPARENTLY 
THEY STARTED SENDING LITTLE POSIES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS 
THEN THE OTHER PAPERMILLS IN DEVON COTTONED ON AND THE NUMBERS WERE FANTASTIC 
YOU'RE TALKING MILLIONS OF POSIES 
A LOT OF PROTECTION CAME IN LEGISLATION AND PEOPLE'S CONSCIENCES 
PERHAPS WITH THE NUMBER OF PRIMROSES THAT WERE DISAPPEARING FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE 
THEN YOU HAD THE AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING NOT ONLY ON THE FARM SIDE BUT IN THE COUNTRY LANES 
THE ROADSIDES WERE BEING SPRAYED AS WELL 
AND HEDGE TRIMMING DIDN'T HELP EITHER 
THERE WERE MILES OF HEDGEROW RIPPED OUT WEREN'T THERE 
YES PARTICULARLY IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
WE RECKON THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE TEN THOUSAND MILES OF HEDGEROW A YEAR DISAPPEARING 
ALL THAT STOPPED AND THE PRIMROSES REALLY STARTED TO COME BACK 
PRIMROSES LOVE HEDGEROWS DON'T THEY 
THEY'RE THE ANCIENT WOOD MOVED OUT INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE 
THIS IS PURE POETRY ISN'T IT 
WE'VE EVEN MADE IT UP HERE YES IT'S ABSOLUTELY IDEAL FOR PRIMROSES 
IT'S EAST FACING HAS PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND THEY'RE SPREADING OUT ACROSS THE BANK HERE 
THEY COLONISE ANYWHERE THEY CAN BUT THEY MUST LOVE IT HERE 
OF COURSE IT'S ALSO OUT OF REACH OF THE SHEEP THEY CAN'T GET UP THERE EITHER 
I BET THEY'VE TRIED 
YOU'VE EVEN GOT PRIMROSES OUTSIDE YOUR FRONT DOOR 
THE SOW SEEDS SO EASILY AND THEY SPREAD INTO PLACES LIKE THIS 
YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE GRASS IS BEGINNING TO COMPETE THEM OUT 
TO ME THEY'RE CINDERELLA PLANTS 
THEY DO THEIR WHOLE THING IN THE SPRING AND THEN GO TO SLEEP 
WHEN THE CLOCK STRIKES TWELVE 
PRIMROSES LIKE A PARTY THEY ALWAYS GATHER IN GROUPS 
THEY ALWAYS LOOK THEIR BEST LIKE THIS 
SOMETIMES IN THE HEDGEROWS YOU SEE THESE COLOURED PRIMROSES DON'T YOU 
RHUBARB AND CUSTARD 
THAT'S AN INDICATION THEY'VE BEEN CROSS POLLINATED 
WITH SOME OTHER GARDEN VARIETIES AS WELL 
SO IT'S A GOOD IDEA IF YOU'RE GOING TO GROW PRIMROSES 
TO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM OTHER 
I THINK SO IF YOU'RE IN A TOWN IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
BUT IF YOU'RE OUT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
THEN IT'S BETTER TO KEEP TO THE WILD PRIMROSES 
OR YOU'LL SUDDENLY SEE THESE RHUBARB AND CUSTARD ONES YOU SEE CROPPING UP AROUND THE COUNTRYSIDE 
YEAH AND IT SPOILS THE EFFECT 
I'VE GOT A LOVELY COLLECTION HERE BUT DON'T WORRY I'M NOT ABOUT TO PLANT THIS ONE HERE 
THE WILD PRIMROSE HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR A HUGE MULTI MILLION POUND INDUSTRY 
AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS HAVE BEEN BRED FROM IT 
EVERYTHING FROM THIS LOVELY LITTLE MILLICENT SO PRETTY AND DAINTY 
TO THIS PRIMULA WANDA WHICH IS A CROSS WITH JULIAE 
AND THIS PARTICULAR WANDA 
HAS GOT A LITTLE GREEN RUFF A JACK IN THE GREEN 
AND I'M VERY FOND OF IT BECAUSE I CAN REMEMBER IT WHEN I WAS LITTLE 
IT GREW IN ALL THE MINERS' AND MILLWORKERS' COTTAGES AND THEY'D PASS IT OVER THE WALL 
AND EVERYBODY ALONG THE ROW WOULD BE GROWING IT 
REALLY EASY TO CULTIVATE AND A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PLANT 
BUT I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD BE TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT IT HERE 
COS THIS IS A WILD CORNER AND I'VE ALL SORTS OF NATIVE PLANTS 
MIXED IN HERE WITH HELLEBORES 
IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE TO PLANT ANY PRIMROSE 
IF YOU JUST LOOK AT NATURE AND TRY AND EMULATE WHAT IT DOES 
THE WHOLE LOT OF THEM LOVE SHADE THEY LOVE RICH HUMUSY SOIL 
AND WHETHER IN TOWN OR COUNTRYSIDE THE CONDITIONS ARE THE SAME 
NOW THE TIME TO DIVIDE PRIMROSES IS AS MISS JEKYLL SAID WHEN THE FLOWERS ARE ON THE WANE 
BUT I CAN'T WAIT I'VE GOT THIS LOVELY BIG CLUMP AND I KNOW 
I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO PULL IT APART AND MAKE SEVERAL FROM IT 
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO 
I'VE FIVE GOOD PLANTS THERE 
BUT BEFORE YOU PLANT THEM JUST USE THE LENGTH OF YOUR PALM 
ABOUT FOUR INCHES THAT'S THE SORT OF LENGTH YOU NEED TO TRIM THESE ROOTS TO 
TAKE A SHARP KNIFE AND JUST CUT ACROSS THERE 
IT LOOKS CRUEL BUT THAT WILL ENCOURAGE THE PLANT TO MAKE LOTS OF FIBROUS FEEDING ROOTS 
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO FOLD THOSE ROOTS 
YOU WANT THEM TO GO STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THIS SOIL 
BUT BEFORE I PUT THEM IN 
I'M GOING TO INCORPORATE A LOAD OF MY PRIZE COMPOST 
COS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY LIKE IT'S HUMUSY FULL OF LEAVES 
AND WONDERFUL STUFF AND IT'LL GET THEM OFF TO A FLYING START 
NOT GOING TO USE ANY FEED AT ALL IN A LITTLE GROUP I THINK THEY'LL LOOK NICEST 
WHAT IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT PRIMROSES TO START WITH 
WELL YOU CAN BUY A PLANT IN A POT OF COURSE IT'S ESSENTIAL YOU NEVER DREAM OF TAKING THEM FROM THE WILD 
BUT ONE PLANT WILL MAKE EVENTUALLY A GREAT BIG COLONY 
BECAUSE IF YOU CONTINUE TO DIVIDE THEM REPLANT THEM YOU CAN DO IT EVERY YEAR 
AND LATER ON YOU CAN TAKE SEED FROM THERE TOO 
PRIMROSE SEED'S BEST WHEN SOWN GREEN 
YOU TAKE THE CAPSULE WHEN IT'S BIG AND FAT BUT STILL GREEN 
AND YOU'LL GET GERMINATION IN A MATTER OF WEEKS 
SO YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN LITTLE BIT OF DEVON 
IN YOUR OWN BACK GARDEN 
THE WEST COUNTRY OFTEN ESCAPES THE WORST OF THE WINTER CLIMATE 
WHICH MAKES IT A HAVEN FOR EARLY FLOWERING PLANTS 
IT'S FAMOUS FOR ITS PLETHORA OF GARDENS TO VISIT 
AND THEY'RE MOST RENOWNED FOR THEIR SPRING PERFORMANCE 
THESE ARE A FEW OF MY PERSONAL FAVOURITES 
FOR ME CAERHAYS IS ONE OF THE JEWELS IN CORNWALL'S CROWN 
FIRST CAME THE STUNNING HOUSE DESIGNED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWO BY JOHN NASH 
THEN NEARLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS LATER THE MAGNIFICENT GARDENS WERE LAID OUT 
WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL IN SPRING 
EASY JUST TAKE A LOOK AT ITS HUGE COLLECTION OF MAJESTIC MAGNOLIAS 
DECIDUOUS MAGNOLIAS CAUSED QUITE A STIR WHEN THEY FIRST ARRIVED 
IN BRITAIN AROUND THE TURN OF THE CENTURY 
FEW BRITISH PEOPLE HAS SEEN SHRUBS THAT FLOWERED BEFORE THEY HAD LEAVES 
MANY DISAPPROVED OF THE NEW ACQUISITIONS 
THOUGHT IT WAS A VULGAR DISPLAY 
HAPPILY NOWADAYS THE FLOWERING IS RECOGNISED AS A GLORIOUS SPECTACLE 
AND A SURE SIGN THAT SPRING HAS ARRIVED 
IF YOU LOVE MAGNOLIAS I RECOMMEND A TRIP TO MARWOOD HILL GARDENS IN NORTH DEVON 
MAGNOLIAS ARE A RECENT ADDITION HERE BUT WITH OVER EIGHTY VARIETIES THEY'RE A TRUE SPECTACLE IN MARCH AND APRIL 
AND THEY'RE JUST ONE OF ITS MANY ATTRACTIONS 
BESIDE ONE OF THE PICTURESQUE LAKES WONDERFUL SPECIMENS OF CHERRY BLOSSOM 
GRACEFULLY CASCADE ABOVE THE WATER 
MIND BLOWING 
I'VE BEEN VISITING THE GARDEN HOUSE ON AND OFF ALL THE TIME WE'VE LIVED HERE 
I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT AT FIRST SIGHT 
THE GROUND THIS TIME OF YEAR IS BURSTING WITH EYE CATCHING GEMS 
IN LUXURIANT COLOURS FROM THE FRESHEST GREEN YOUNG SHOOTS OF FERNS 
TO CARPETS OF ERYTHRONIUMS AND WOODLAND BULBS 
SPRING'S ALSO THE TIME FOR THAT FINAL CLEARING UP 
GETTING EVERYTHING SHIPSHAPE I'VE LEFT EVERYTHING IN THIS BED 
IT'S A WAVE PLANTING FULL OF LATE FLOWERING PERENNIALS AND GRASSES 
BUT I'VE LEFT IT OVER WINTER TO PROTECT THE BASES OF THE PLANTS 
BUT ALSO COS THESE FANTASTIC RUBECCIA HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL FOOD FOR THE BIRDS ALL WINTER 
ALL THESE STEMS ARE DRY NOW AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT THEM 
ON THE COMPOST HEAP COS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANY GOOD 
BUT THERE IS ONE WAY I CAN RETURN SOME OF THEIR GOODNESS TO THE GARDEN 
WELL THIS IS SOME LOVELY WOOD ASH FROM A PREVIOUS BONFIRE COLLECTED AS SOON AS THE ASHES WERE COOL 
IF YOU LEAVE IT THE RAIN WILL LEACH ALL THE NUTRIENT OUT 
AND DO EXACTLY THE JOB YOU WANT TO DO IN THE SOIL ON YOUR BEDS 
NOW I'M GOING TO USE SOME OF IT IN THIS LOVELY BED 
I'VE CHOSEN THIS SPOT AND I THINK THE SOIL'S NICE AND LIGHT AND SANDY 
BUT VERY FERTILE BUT THIS WOOD ASH IS REALLY GOING TO GIVE IT A SUPPLEMENT 
AND I'M GOING TO GROW ALL SORTS IN HERE 
MY SHALLOTS WILL BE FIRST BUT I SHALLN'T PLANT ANYTHING FOR A WEEK 
JUST TO LET THIS GET A CHANCE TO BE ABSORBED BY THE SOIL 
I'M GOING TO SPRINKLE IT ON NOT TOO MUCH 
JUST A LIGHT DRESSING IS ADEQUATE 
MY SOIL'S SLIGHTLY ACID YOU CAN TELL MOSS GATHERS HERE AND THERE 
AND WOOD ASH IS ALKALINE SO IT'S GOING TO HELP THAT TOO 
IF YOUR SOIL'S VERY ALKALINE YOU'VE GOT TO USE IT QUITE GINGERLY 
BUT I THINK THIS DRESSING IS JUST WHAT'S NEEDED 
NOW WOOD ASH IS SO BENEFICIAL TO YOUR SOIL AND PLANTS 
COS IT REALLY MAKES THEM STRONG 
IT MAKES THINGS FLOWER AND FRUIT AND IN THE CASE OF THESE ROOTS 
IT'S GOING TO MAKE EVERYTHING REALLY STRONG AND IT HAS THIS OTHER HUGE BENEFIT 
WHICH IS IT HELPS TO STOP CARROT ROOT FLY CARROT WEEVIL AND WIREWORM AND ALL SORTS OF SOIL BORNE PESTS 
NOW I'M GOING TO RAKE THIS IN 
I THINK THAT'S ADEQUATE 
I'VE GOT PLENTY LEFT TO USE IN OTHER PLACES TOO 
ANOTHER REALLY GOOD USE FOR WOOD ASH IS TO SPRINKLE IT ONTO YOUR COMPOST HEAP 
PUT IT ON IN LAYERS EVERY SO OFTEN COS IT HELPS SWEETEN THE COMPOST 
AND COUNTERACTS THE OVER ACIDITY 
ANOTHER THING I WANT TO ADD TO THE COMPOST HEAP IS THIS COMFREY 
I'M GOING TO DIG IT UP FROM AROUND THIS APPLE TREE 
THE GREAT THING IS COMFREY DOES A TOTALLY DIFFERENT JOB ON THE COMPOST HEAP 
FROM WOOD ASH COS IT PROVIDES LOTS OF NITROGEN IT'S GOT POTASH 
AND TRACE ELEMENTS TOO BUT THAT'S ITS MAJOR CONTRIBUTION THAT LEAFY GROWTH SO EARLY IN THE YEAR 
BUILDS IT UP BRILLIANTLY 
BUT MY COMPOST HEAP CAN WAIT COS MY PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO FEED THIS BEAUTIFUL APPLE TREE 
IT'S A DISCOVERY AND IT'S REALLY GOING TO BENEFIT FROM AN APPLICATION OF WOOD ASH 
BECAUSE THIS IS LOW IN NITROGEN IT WON'T ENCOURAGE PREMATURE LEAFY GROWTH 
IT WILL ENCOURAGE ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS WHICH WILL BE A PICTURE LATER ON COVERED IN APPLE BLOSSOM 
AND IT WILL HELP THEM SET FRUIT REALLY WELL 
OF COURSE IT'S NOT JUST THE PROMISE OF FLOWERING FRUIT TO COME 
THAT'S OF INTEREST THIS TIME OF YEAR 
THESE MAGICAL HELLEBORES ARE ALREADY DOING THEIR THING FULLY IN FLOWER 
AND ALTHOUGH THEIR SEED'S NOT EDIBLE 
IT'S HIGHLY POISONOUS I WANT TO COLLECT MASSES OF IT LATER ON 
SO I'M ALREADY THINKING ABOUT THAT TIME TO COME SUMMER AND AUTUMN WHEN THEY WILL BE SOWN 
I'VE POLLINATED A FEW THESE LITTLE BOWS HERE 
WITH EMBROIDERY THREAD TIED UP BEHIND THEM 
ALL CROSSES I'VE MADE BETWEEN DIFFERENT HELLEBORES 
AND ALREADY YOU CAN SEE INSIDE THESE OLDER FLOWERS THESE FAT SEED PODS BEGINNING TO FORM 
IT'S HUGELY EXCITING SUCH A WONDERFUL TIME OF YEAR 
AND AS WELL AS ANTICIPATING THESE SEEDS THERE ARE LOADS I SOWED LAST AUTUMN THAT NEED MY ATTENTION NOW 
SPRING IS THE TIME OF THE YEAR TO START SEED SOWING IN EARNEST 
AND I CAN HARDLY STOP MYSELF 
BUT ONE OF THE MOST DISCONCERTING THINGS IS WHEN YOUR SEEDS HAVE GERMINATED 
AND THE SLUGS HAVE BEEN GRAZING LOOK WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO THIS DILL 
THAT'S DESPITE MY PUTTING THIS GRIT ON THE TOP TOO 
I SUPPOSE THEY'RE VERY TENDER THEY'VE DONE THE SAME TO MY TOMATOES 
SOME HAVEN'T EVEN GOT ANY LEAVES 
BUT YOU CAN MAKE A PHYSICAL BARRIER 
BETWEEN THE SLUGS AND WHAT THEY'RE AIMING AT 
YOU CAN USE THINGS LIKE THIS VERMICULITE 
I'VE FILLED A TRAY WITH THIS STUFF AND IT'S PRETTY GOOD COS IT'S VERY DRY 
AND THE SLUGS HATE THE TEXTURE AND IT SUCKS OUT ALL THE MOISTURE 
FROM THEM WHICH IS HOW THEY TRAVEL 
I THINK THEY FALL IN AND SUFFOCATE IN THIS STUFF 
BUT MOST IMPORTANT IS BE ETERNALLY VIGILANT 
CHECK THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SEED TRAYS REGULARLY 
JUST MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO LITTLE SLUGS LURKING UNDER THERE 
AND I TRY AND DO IT ONCE A DAY IF I GET THE OPPORTUNITY 
COS IT'S ASTONISHING HOW FAST THEY MOVE IN 
ANYWAY THESE ASTRANTIAS 
I PUT THEM IN LAST SEPTEMBER AND THEY'VE GERMINATED REALLY WELL 
WHICH IS GREAT COS IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK 
I ACTUALLY VERNALISED THE SEED I TOOK THE WHOLE TRAY OUTSIDE LET IT FREEZE A COUPLE OF TIMES 
AND LO AND BEHOLD THERE ARE ALL THESE LITTLE GREEN SHOOTS COMING UP 
AND THE FIRST THING THEY MAKE IS COTYLEDON LEAVES 
THESE LOVELY LITTLE FEEDING LEAVES BUT IT'S ALREADY DISTINGUISHABLE AS AN ASTRANTIA 
IT'S ALREADY GOT PROPER LEAVES LOOK AT THAT ROOT SYSTEM 
IT'S FABULOUS BEAUTIFUL JUST LOVELY 
I'M GOING TO MAKE A HOLE IN THIS THIS IS AN OLD BASHED UP MODULE TRAY 
FILLED FULL OF COMPOST FROM MY PRIZE COMPOST HEAP 
AND I'M GOING TO TRY THEM IN THERE 
AND WHEN EACH CELL IS FILLED WITH THEIR ROOTS 
THEY'LL MAKE INDIVIDUAL PLANTS I CAN PUSH THEM OUT TRANSFER THEM TO THEIR OWN POTS 
AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE READY I CAN PLANT THEM OUT 
JUST THINK FROM THOSE COUPLE OF SEED HEADS 
NEXT YEAR WE'LL HAVE A MASSIVE SEA OF BRILLIANT CRIMSON LOVELY THOUGHT 
THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ARE OFTEN ACKNOWLEDGED 
AS THE MASTERS OF TECHNIQUE WHEN IT COMES TO GARDENING SKILLS 
WE THOUGHT WE'D TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR PROWESS 
BY GETTING EXPERTS FROM ALL FOUR R. H. S. GARDENS TO SHARE THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN A REGULAR MASTERCLASS 
THIS WEEK CHRIS BAILES FROM R. H. S. ROSEMOOR 
WILL DEMYSTIFY THE PERENNIAL PROBLEM OF HOW TO RENOVATE AN OVERGROWN CLIMBER 
I'M CHRISTOPHER BAILES CURATOR OF THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY'S GARDEN AT ROSEMOOR 
AND TODAY I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE PRUNING A SUMMER FLOWERING CLIMBER 
THIS TIME OF YEAR THE PLANTS ARE JUST STIRRING FROM THEIR WINTER REST 
THIS PARTICULAR CLIMBER IS CLEMATIS BILL MACKENZIE 
WHICH FROM JULY TO NOVEMBER HAS BEAUTIFUL LEMON PEEL 
HANGING YELLOW BELLS FOLLOWED BY THESE LOVELY FLUFFY SEED HEADS 
THE JOB WE WANT TO DO IS BRING IT BACK WITHIN BOUNDS 
AND TO ENCOURAGE IT TO HAVE ITS GROWTH AT THIS HEIGHT 
ENTWINING WITH THE ROSE AND HONEYSUCKLE 
SO VISITORS CAN HAVE THE FLOWERS PRESENTED AT EYE LEVEL 
THE PROPER TOOLS ARE 
A GOOD SHARP PAIR OF SECATEURS 
SOME SOFT STRING DOESN'T NEED TO BE PARTICULARLY THICK 
COS YOU'RE NOT HOLDING UP ANYTHING VERY HEAVY OR SPRINGY 
AND A NICE SHARP KNIFE 
FIRST ASSESS THE PLANT 
SEE WHAT GROWTH YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TAKE OFF 
AND WHERE THE MAJOR STRUCTURAL STEMS FOR RETAINING ARE 
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED ABOUT CUTTING INTO AN OLD AND CONGESTED PLANT 
THE WORST YOU CAN DO IS TO LOSE OR MAYBE ONLY DELAY A YEAR'S FLOWERING 
THIS PROBABLY LOOKS VERY SEVERE BUT DON'T BE DAUNTED THE KEY TO PRUNING SUMMER FLOWERING CLIMBERS 
IS TO TAKE OFF ALL OF LAST YEAR'S FLOWERED WOOD 
TO EXPOSE THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PLANT WHICH YOU THEN TIE IN 
TO PRODUCE THE SUMMER'S FLORAL DISPLAY 
WHEN TYING IN A SOFT STEMMED PLANT SUCH AS CLEMATIS 
WHAT I PREFER TO DO IS RUN THE TWINE AROUND IN A LOOP 
AND THEN GENTLY PULL IT BACK TO THE SUPPORT 
A WIRE OR NAIL AND TIE OFF AGAINST THE WIRE OR NAIL 
SO AS NOT TO CONSTRICT THE STEM 
WHEN YOU'VE TAKEN A LOT OF GROWTH OFF IT'S A KINDNESS TO GIVE THEM 
SOME WATER AND A DRY SPELL 
GENERAL PURPOSE FERTILISER AND DO THAT EVERY YEAR WHEN YOU PRUNE THEM 
AND THERE IT IS JOB DONE DON'T PUT OFF TACKLING YOUR SUMMER FLOWERING CLIMBERS 
IF YOU LEAVE THEM THEY'LL BECOME FULL AND RAMPANT AND DIFFICULT TO CONTROL 
GET PRUNING NOW AND YOU'LL HAVE A SUMMER'S WORTH OF FLOWERS 
CHOOSING THE RIGHT CLIMBER CAN BE A PRETTY CONFUSING BUSINESS 
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO BEAR IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE COMING TO MAKE YOUR CHOICE 
JUST WHAT SORT OF STRUCTURE YOU'VE GOT 
PLANTS HAVE DEVELOPED THREE MAIN WAYS OF CLIMBING 
THE FIRST WAY IS BY ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS LIKE THIS HYDRANGEA PETIOLARIS 
I LOVE THIS PLANT AND IT REALLY CLINGS TO THE WALL OF MY HOUSE 
IT'S HAD NO SUPPORT WHATSOEVER RIGHT FROM THE WORD GO 
WE JUST TRAINED IT IN WITH A LITTLE BAMBOO CANE BUT NOW 
IT IS WELL AND TRULY STUCK IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE AT ALL 
NOW IT USES THIS METHOD OF CLIMBING 
PRODUCING THESE TINY LITTLE ROOTS MASSES AND MASSES OF THEM 
RIGHT DOWN THE BACK OF THE STEMS 
WHERE IT COMES FROM IN THE FAR EAST IT ATTACHES ITSELF TO FOREST TREES AND IT CLIMBS 
RIGHT UP INTO THE LIGHT 
SO IT'S A HUGELY APPROPRIATE PLANT FOR A PLACE LIKE THIS 
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A CLIMBER FOR A NORTH OR EAST FACING WALL 
AND THERE'S NOTHING TO SUPPORT IT NO WIRES NO NOTHING 
THEN THIS IS THE PLANT FOR YOU IT'LL JUST CLING AND STAY THERE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE GET VERY WORRIED ABOUT CLIMBERS LIKE THIS 
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THEY DESTROY THE STONEWORK OR BRICKWORK 
NOT A BIT OF IT AS LONG AS IT'S IN GOOD NICK WHEN YOU PLANT YOUR PLANT 
THIS PLANT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO PROTECT IT AND LOOK AFTER THIS WALL 
AND AT THE SAME TIME IT'S SO MUCH BETTER FOR WILDLIFE THAN A BARE WALL 
IT'S FULL OF FLOWERS LOADS OF NECTAR WE'VE EVEN GOT A FEW BIRDS NESTS IN HERE 
SO IT'S A MUCH BETTER WAY OF UTILISING THE WALL THAN JUST LEAVING IT BARE 
OTHER CLIMBERS TWINE THEY'VE EVOLVED TO WRAP THEMSELVES AROUND THE STEMS OF OTHER PLANTS 
IN THIS CASE THIS HONEYSUCKLE HAS USED A ROSE TO WRAP ITSELF ROUND 
WELL I PLANTED THEM ACTUALLY BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S DOING 
I'M JUST EXPLOITING THE PROPENSITY OF THIS PLANT TO DO THIS 
IT HAS NO SPECIAL SORT OF LITTLE ROOTS LIKE THE HYDRANGEA 
IT HAS NO TENDRILS SO TWINERS ARE THE PERFECT PLANT TO GROW IF YOU'VE GOT AN ESTABLISHED HOST PLANT 
A TREE A SHRUB OR IN THIS CASE ANOTHER CLIMBER 
AND WHAT'S MORE YOU DOUBLE YOUR INTEREST 
WELL THE THIRD METHOD THAT PLANTS HAVE EVOLVED TO CLIMB IS BY TENDRILS 
AND I'M GOING TO PUT IN A TYPICAL PLANT IN THAT SORT OF CATEGORY 
IT'S THIS LOVELY CLEMATIS ARMANDII 
BUT BEHIND IT HERE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS MECHANISM WORKS 
THIS IS VITIS COIGNETIAE 
IT'S A BIG RAMPANT SORT OF VINE 
AND ALTHOUGH I'VE DONE MY BEST TO SORT OF TRAIN IT ALONG HERE 
AND IT'S TAKEN FULL ADVANTAGE OF THIS TRELLIS 
IT'S NEVER HAPPIER THAN WHEN IT SHOOTS UP INTO THESE TREES 
AND IT CAN JUST WRAP THOSE TENDRILS AROUND AND PULL ITSELF UP 
IT'S EVEN ESCAPED INTO THE FIELD AND IS GOING ALONG THE NATIVE HEDGE 
WELL IT'S A GRAND PLANT IN THE AUTUMN THIS 
COS THESE GREAT BIG HUGE LEAVES 
DEVELOP ALL SORTS OF FANTASTIC CRIMSON AND DARK RED TINTS 
AND IT'S A GLORIOUS FRAMEWORK IN THE WINTER 
BUT I THOUGHT IF I ADD THIS CLEMATIS ARMANDII 
WE'VE GOT THE ADVANTAGE OF THESE BEAUTIFUL EVERGREEN LEAVES AND THESE FABULOUS 
ALMOND SCENTED FLOWERS GREAT BIG CLUSTERS AND PANICLES OF THEM 
IT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY USEFUL FOR ALL THESE EARLY FLYING BUMBLEBEES 
THEY'LL ABSOLUTELY ADORE THE NECTAR IN THOSE FLOWERS 
BUT IT'S A VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL METHOD OF CLIMBING 
NOW COMING UP IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR 
WE'VE GOT MORE OF MY FAVOURITE WEST COUNTRY GARDENS FOR YOU 
THIS TIME PLACES THAT ARE AT THEIR BEST IN THE SUMMER MONTHS 
AND I'M GOING TO BE PLANNING AHEAD FOR LATE SUMMER 
WITH JOBS THAT I MUST TACKLE RIGHT NOW 
BUT FIRST WE'RE OFF TO THE GLORIOUS SCILLY ISLES 
SITUATED IN THE ATLANTIC JUST TWENTY EIGHT MILES OFF LANDS' END 
LIES A COMMUNITY OF TINY ISLANDS KNOWN AS THE SCILLY ISLES 
ONE OF OUR EARLIEST CUT FLOWERS HAS HAD ITS ROOTS DEEPLY SET 
ON THIS SALT LADEN DEEPLY INHOSPITABLE SANDY SOIL FOR YEARS 
TO BE HONEST I THINK IF WE TOOK SOMEWHERE LIKE SAINT MARTIN'S AND TRANSFERRED IT IN ITS ENTIRETY 
TO THE MAINLAND WE'D PROBABLY PUT A FENCE AROUND IT AND SAY NOT SUITABLE FOR AGRICULTURE 
OR POSSIBLY HUMAN HABITATION 
IT'S PRETTY WILD IT'S PRETTY ROCKY AND EVEN THE SOILS ARE VERY SHALLOW SO NOT ESPECIALLY IDEAL 
WE ARE A VERY SPECIALIST FARM AND VERY SPECIALIST BUSINESS 
WE GROW ENTIRELY SCENTED FLOWERS AND THAT'S BASED PREDOMINANTLY AROUND 
THE CROP OF SCENTED NARCISSI YOU SEE AROUND US NOW 
FOR WHICH THE ISLAND ARE FAMOUS IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY PLACE THAT GROWS THESE VARIETIES OF FLOWERS' 
AND THAT IS REALLY OUR NICHE 
SCILLY HAD A HUGE CLIMATIC ADVANTAGE WE COULD PRODUCE SPRING FLOWERS IN NOVEMBER TIME 
WHEN THEY HAD A PREMIUM PRICE IN THE LEAD UP TO CHRISTMAS 
THEY USED TO SAY ONE HUNDRED BOXES BEFORE CHRISTMAS ON THE MARKET WAS WORTH ONE THOUSAND AFTER 
WE USED TO SEND THEM MUCH MORE OPEN THEN BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE CENTRAL HEATING 
SO THE FLOWERS LASTED LONGER IN THE HOUSES AS WELL 
BUT TIMES CHANGE 
WE'D FOUND INCREASINGLY THAT ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF FLOWERS ARE BEING IMPORTED TO THE U. K. 
AND THE LITTLE NICHE THAT SCILLY HAD WAS BEING QUICKLY ERODED 
AND SO IT MEANT THAT WE HAD TO FIND OTHER WAYS OF GETTING THE FLOWERS TO THE CUSTOMERS AT A PROFIT 
SOMEBODY CAME PAST THE FARM AND SAW THE FLOWERS AND SAID 
OOH CAN I POST SOME OF THOSE TO A FRIEND PLEASE 
WE WENT OOH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
THE VARIETIES THAT WE GROW SPECIFICALLY ARE TAZETTA NARCISSI 
WHICH DIFFER FROM THE STANDARD CUP DAFFODILS WHICH FOR EXAMPLE 
LINCOLNSHIRE AND CORNWALL ARE FAMOUS FOR 
THEY HAVE A REQUIREMENT FOR HEAT IN THE PRECEDING SUMMER 
WHEREAS TRADITIONAL CUP DAFFODILS HAVE A VERNALISATION REQUIREMENT FOR THE COLD PERIOD OVER WINTER 
AS FAR AS THE NARCISSI GOES IT'S REALLY LOOKING FOR A GOOD STURDY CLEAN STEM 
AS MANY HEADS AS POSSIBLE GOOD COLOURING TO THE HEADS 
AND THE VERY DISTINCTIVE NARCISSI SCENT 
YEAH WE'VE GOT POST BOAT FIFTEEN MINUTES LOWER TOWN 
OVER 
THE MONEY COMES INTO THE ISLANDS THE MONEY THAT PEOPLE WORKING ON THE FARM 
EARN THERE IS BEING SPENT ON BOATING IS BEING SPENT IN THE SHOPS 
IS BEING SPENT IN THE PUBS IT'S KEEPING IT IN THE COMMUNITY 
AND THAT'S WHAT ALL THESE ISLANDS NEED 
ALL ANY COMMUNITY NEEDS IT NEEDS TO BECOME VIBRANT 
IT NEEDS TO HAVE INDUSTRY AND WE'VE MANAGED TO KEEP THAT INDUSTRY LINKED TO THE LAND 
WHICH IS A NICE THING THAT WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO 
AND IT'S NOW BEEN SUCCESSFUL 
WHAT A LOT OF OUR CUSTOMERS LIKE ABOUT BUYING FLOWERS FROM US 
IS THE SENSE OF PLACE THAT COMES WITH FLOWERS FROM SCILLY 
A LOT OF OUR CUSTOMERS WILL HAVE EITHER COME TO SCILLY THEMSELVES 
AND HAVE SOME CONNECTION THEY HOLIDAY HERE OR WANT TO 
AND KNOW WHERE WE ARE THAT ELEMENT OF KNOWING WHERE THEY'VE COME FROM 
AND KNOWING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FARM AND ABOUT US THEY LIKE 
AND HAVING THAT CONNECTION AND TRACEABILITY OF WHERE THE FLOWERS HAVE COME FROM 
SPRING IS PROBABLY THE MOST INSPIRING TIME TO VISIT THE SCILLY ISLES 
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE VISITING DURING THE LAST WEEK IN MARCH 
THEN YOU MIGHT LIKE TO JOIN IN THE U. K.'S MOST WESTERLY WALKING FESTIVAL 
IF YOU WANT FURTHER DETAILS GO TO OUR WEBSITE 
WELL YOU CAN HAVE BULBS IN SEASON RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH THE YEAR 
STARTING WITH SNOWDROPS AND MOVING ON TO WONDERFUL THINGS LIKE THESE FRITILLARIES 
RIGHT THROUGH THE SUMMER AND INTO THE AUTUMN 
I ADORE THIS FRIT IT'S ONE CALLED 
IT'S A SELECTION THAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE SUPERIOR FLOWERS 
THEY REALLY ARE MIND BLOWING AREN'T THEY THIS LOVELY PLUMMY COLOUR 
AND THIS LOVELY GLAUCOUS TOUCH TO THE LEAVES 
I'VE GROWN MINE IN POTS I COULD HAVE PUT THEM STRAIGHT OUTSIDE 
BUT I'VE GOT HEAVY HEAVY SOIL AND SOMETIMES THEY TEND TO ROT AWAY 
BUT I THINK THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY MARVELLOUS 
I CAN GO AND DROP THEM INTO TERRACOTTA POTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND THEY'RE A MOVEABLE FEAST THEN THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT GROWING BULBS IN POTS 
YOU CAN PUT THEM IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND REALLY MAKE THE MOST OF THEM ENJOY THEM TO THE FULL 
FOLLOWING ON FROM THEM I WANT TO HAVE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LILY FAMILY 
FRITS BELONG TO THE LILY FAMILY 
BUT I WANT TO HAVE MORE TRADITIONAL LILIES TOO 
I'M GOING TO GROW LILIUM REGALE 
REALLY LOVELY BULBS HERE 
BUT I'M GOING TO GROW IT IN RATHER AN UNUSUAL CONTAINER 
THIS IS FOR AQUATIC PLANTS AND IT'S MADE OF THIS FINE SORT OF MESH 
I KNOW THAT THE ROOTS WILL BE ABLE TO ESCAPE THROUGH HERE AND JUST GROW INTO THE SOIL 
COS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH THESE 
I'M GOING TO PLANT THEM NOW KEEP THEM IN THE GREENHOUSE 
AND THEN LATER ON I'M GOING TO DIG BIG HOLES WHEN I CAN SEE WHERE THE PERENNIALS HAVE COME UP 
AND WHERE I COULD REALLY FIT THESE LILIES IN TO THE VERY BEST EFFECT 
THESE ARE FINE FAT BULBS AND WHAT YOU WANT TO BE LOOKING FOR 
IS LOVELY FLESHY FIRM SORT OF SCALES 
AND GOOD ROOTS LIKE THIS REALLY ROBUST NOT DESICCATED AND DRIED OUT AT ALL 
YOU CAN ALMOST TELL BY THE WEIGHT OF THE BULB 
AND I'M GOING TO PUT THREE IN THIS POT 
COS I WANT THEM TO REALLY MAKE AN EFFECT AND I'LL DO SEVERAL OF THEM 
SO THAT I CAN INTERSPERSE THEM PERHAPS ALONG ONE BORDER 
I LOVE LILY REGALE IT'S GOT THESE PURE WHITE FLOWERS FABULOUS SCENT 
ESPECIALLY IN THE EVENING 
NOW I'VE PLUNGED THEM RIGHT TO THE BOTTOM OF THERE 
AND I'M JUST GOING TO COVER THEM JUST UP TO THE TIP OF THE BULBS NOW 
AS THEY GROW I SHALL ADD MORE COMPOST I'M GOING TO KEEP THEM IN A GREENHOUSE 
OR IN MY COAL FRAME OVER HERE 
AND I'M GROWING THEM JUST IN MY VERY VERY BEST COMPOST 
I'LL KEEP ON TOPPING THEM UP THEN WHEN I DECIDE THE TIME IS RIGHT 
OUT THEY'LL GO AND INTO THEIR RIGHT PLACE 
AND THEY'LL GO ON FOR AS LONG AS SIX WEEKS DURING THE SUMMER 
BUT I WANT I WANT MORE COLOUR FROM BULBS AFTER THAT 
SO I'M GOING TO PLANT SOMETHING 
THAT YOU AND I KNOW AS ACIDANTHERA 
AND IS RELATED TO ORDINARY GLADIOLI IT'S GOT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
SORT OF CORMS BUT THESE ARE REAL BEAUTS 
THEY'RE LOVELY AND I RECKON I COULD GET AS MANY AS SEVEN OR SO 
IN THIS POT SO I'LL HALF FILL IT WITH COMPOST 
I MEAN THE MORE YOU GET IN THE BETTER THE EFFECT 
AND BECAUSE THEY'RE BULBS THEY'VE ALREADY GOT 
ALL THAT STORAGE ALL THAT GOODNESS INSIDE THEM 
SO YOU CAN'T REALLY CROWD THEM OUT IN HERE 
NOW I MIGHT KEEP THESE INSIDE TOO IN THE GREENHOUSE 
OR IN MY COAL FRAME AND PUT THEM OUT LATER 
ALTHOUGH IF YOU WANT TO PLANT THEM WHEN FROST IS PAST 
YOU CAN PLANT THEM DIRECTLY INTO THE GROUND 
BUT HERE I'LL BE ABLE TO PUT THEM EXACTLY WHERE I WANT THEM 
I REALLY ENJOY THESE POTS 
ONE OF THE NEWEST AND YET ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS CORNISH GARDENS IS THE EDEN PROJECT 
IT'S RENOWNED FOR ITS ENORMOUS BIOMES PACKED WITH TROPICAL AND MEDITERRANEAN PLANTS 
BUT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR IT'S THE OUTDOOR LANDSCAPE WHICH BURSTS INTO COLOUR AND LIFE 
THEY'VE LITERALLY GONE BULB MAD 
BULB MANIA STARTED BECAUSE WE WANTED TO DO A SPECTACULAR SPRING SEASON AT EDEN 
WE KNOW THAT WE GET A LOT OF GARDEN VISITORS TO CORNWALL 
AND BULBS WERE SOMETHING THAT WASN'T DONE ANYWHERE ELSE 
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE REALLY UNIQUE 
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SITE TO SHOW OFF BULBS BECAUSE OF THE SLOPES AND TOPOGRAPHY 
WE STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND EVERY YEAR WE JUST WANT TO DO THINGS 
BIGGER AND BETTER WHAT WE DO IS TRY 
AND PAINT THE SITE WITH AS MUCH COLOUR AS WE CAN 
WE'VE GOT BARE SLOPES 
THAT NORMALLY HAVE CROPS ON THEM SO WE BRIGHTEN THEM UP 
WE'VE BIG BANDS OF PLANTING TO ECHO THE SHAPES AND FORMS IN THE LANDSCAPE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY 
WE'VE GOT SOME AREAS THAT ARE MORE NATURALISTICALLY PLANTED 
AND AREAS THAT MIGHT LOOK MORE LIKE A GARDEN SETTING 
IN OUR MEDITERRANEAN BIOME WE'VE GOT A HUGE DISPLAY OF TULIPS 
WHICH ARE JUST A FANTASTIC COLOUR ENOUGH TO CHEER ANYBODY UP ON A COLD SPRING DAY 
A BIG DRIVER FOR DOING BULB MANIA WAS TO CELEBRATE THE CORNISH DAFFODIL INDUSTRY 
A GREAT MANY OF THE COMMERCIAL DAFFODILS ARE GROWN IN CORNWALL 
AND ALSO THERE'S A BREEDING PROGRAMME HERE AS WELL 
SO A LOT OF THE VARIETIES THAT YOU'LL SEE IN YOUR GARDEN 
ACTUALLY HAD THEIR GENESIS IN CORNWALL 
NARCISSUS CHARLTON HAS A FANTASTIC PHARMACEUTICAL PROPERTY 
FROM IT YOU CAN EXTRACT A CHEMICAL CALLED GALANTOMINE 
USED IN THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
BULB MANIA IN THE FIRST YEAR STARTED OFF WITH THIRTY THOUSAND BULBS 
SINCE THEN WE'VE KEPT QUITE A FEW OF THEM IN THE GROUND TO NATURALISE 
AND WE'VE ADDED LOTS MORE TO IT EVERY YEAR 
AND WE'VE PROBABLY GOT AT LEAST A MILLION NOW 
IN THE GROUND TO CREATE A REALLY SPECTACULAR SHOW 
THIS STRETCH ALONG THE PLANE TREES HERE IS ACTUALLY FULL OF HOSTIS 
SO BULB WISE WHAT WE'VE HAD TO DO IS IN THE SPRING 
WE PLANTED OUT ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND CROCUS 
AND ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THE MASCARI 
WHICH WERE LITERALLY JUST POURED OUT ON TOP OF THE BED 
THEN BURIED IN AMENITY GREEN WASTE 
AND THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR THEY'VE BEEN IN AND THEY'RE STILL FLOWERING STRONG 
AND THE HOSTIS GROW THROUGH FINE SO YOU GET A SUCCESSION OF COLOUR FROM THE CROCUS TO THE MASCARI 
THEN THE GROWTH OF THE HOSTIS COMING THROUGH IT'S WORKED WELL 
AT THE EDEN PROJECT WE LIKE TO TELL THE STORIES THAT RELATE 
TO SOME OF THE PLANTS THAT WE'RE SHOWING ON SITE 
AND TULIPS CAUSED A HUGE STIR IN HOLLAND IN THE MID SEVENTEENTH C. 
PEOPLE GOT EXTREMELY EXCITED ABOUT A PARTICULAR BREAK CAUSED BY A VIRUS 
THAT CREATED AN EXTRAORDINARY PATTERNING LIKE THE PARROT TULIPS WE HAVE TODAY 
AND THEY WERE TRADED FOR HUGE SUMS AS MUCH AS A HOUSE IN SOME CASES 
AND THE ART OF THE TIME WE SEE TODAY WAS FOR PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T AFFORD THE REAL THING 
WELL THE BULB DISPLAYS AT EDEN ARE AT THEIR PEAK RIGHT NOW 
REALLY WORTH A VISIT A SPECTACULAR SHOW 
BUT IF YOU'RE THINKING OF COMING TO THE WEST COUNTRY LATER ON THIS YEAR 
THERE ARE LOADS OF WONDERFUL GARDENS TO VISIT HERE ARE SOME OF MY PERSONAL FAVOURITES 
SET ON THE PENINSULA ON THE VILLAGE OF SAINT MAWES 
THE ITALIAN GARDEN OF LAMORRAN HOUSE LOOKS UP TOWARDS THE LIZARD 
WITHIN ITS FOUR ACRES IT'S GOT VISTAS OF THE HEADLAND AND SEA 
AS WELL AS A WALLED GARDEN WITH OLIVES AND BOUGAINVILLEA 
THERE ARE SUBTROPICAL PALMS AND LOADS OF SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE PLANTS 
AS WELL AS PLANTS THAT ARE MORE TYPICAL OF THE SOUTH WEST LIKE RHODODENDRONS AND AZALEAS 
IT'S CLAIMED THERE'S BEEN NO FROST THERE FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THE GARDENS OPEN IN APRIL 
THE LOST GARDENS OF HELIGAN WERE RESTORED IN NINETEEN NINETY 
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO SEE 
A SHOWCASE KITCHEN GARDEN AND A POTTING SHED FULL OF OLD TOOLS 
AS WELL AS A PRIMEVAL SUBTROPICAL JUNGLE GARDEN 
WITH GIANT TREE FERNS AND THE GUNNERA SO SYNONYMOUS WITH THE WEST COUNTRY 
THE SCIENTIST OTTO OVERBECK LIVED HERE FROM NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT TO NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN 
HE WAS AN ECCENTRIC SHOW OFF 
WHO LOVED ALL THINGS WEIRD AND UNUSUAL 
HE WAS A SERIAL INVENTOR 
AND HIS MOST FAMOUS INVENTION WAS THE ELECTRICAL REJUVENATOR 
A CURE ALL AND AGE DEFYING EARLY ANTI WRINKLE TREATMENT 
USING ELECTRIC SHOCKS 
WITH SPECTACULAR VIEWS OF THE SALCOMBE ESTUARY 
THIS DISTINCTLY MEDITERRANEAN GARDEN WITH ITS FORMAL NINETEEN THIRTIES TERRACES 
IS STUFFED FULL OF AN ECLECTIC MIX OF TENDER EXOTIC PLANTING 
THE MOTTO SEEMS TO BE IF IT WORKS DO IT 
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF SURPRISES BUT ONE WORD OF WARNING 
ACCESS TO THE GARDEN IS LIMITED 
AND IT'S BEST TO AVOID TRAVELLING IN LARGE VEHICLES 
AS THE ROAD IS STEEP AND NARROW 
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHERE TO START IN MY GARDEN 
WHEN IT COMES TO CHOOSING MY FAVOURITE PLANTS 
BUT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THEM 
IT'S A NORTH AMERICAN BULBOUS PLANT RELATED TO LILIES 
AND IT'S JUST GOT THIS STAR QUALITY 
PEOPLE ARE STOPPED IN THEIR TRACKS WHEN THEY SEE IT 
THEY JUST WONDER WHAT IT IS AND IT DOES HAVE THIS AMAZING PRESENCE 
IT'S CALLED TRILLIUM BECAUSE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS IN THREES 
THESE LOVELY PETALS AND THESE BRACKS 
THESE GORGEOUS LEAVES WHEN THEY GET GOING 
THEY'RE THREE PRONGED AS WELL 
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SORT OF DARKNESS 
YOU KNOW DANGER SOMETHING REPTILIAN TO IT 
IT'S GOT SUCH PERSONA BUT LOOK AT THIS 
I ONLY JUST NOTICED THIS 
THESE ARE SEEDLINGS 
A BIG FAT SEED HEAD MUST'VE DROPPED DOWN HERE 
MAYBE LAST YEAR MAYBE THE YEAR BEFORE 
IT'S MADE A WHOLE SERIES OF LITTLE PLANTS 
I'LL HAVE THOSE OUT OF THERE POP 'EM UP 
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT I'M GOING TO HAVE MASSES AND MASSES IN THERE 
ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL WOODLAND PLANTS AT THIS TIME OF YEAR 
IT IS THEIR SEASON 
AND MY YELLOW HELLEBORES OVER HERE 
OH I DON'T KNOW THEY MAKE MY HEART THROB THEY REALLY DO 
AND THEN IN THIS BED I'VE GOT APRICOT ONES 
BLACK OPHIOPOGON AND WHITE NARCISSI 
AND IN THIS ONE THESE VERY VERY DARK HELLEBORES 
THESE ARE REALLY SPECIAL 
YOU CAN'T SEE THEM UNTIL YOU GET RIGHT UP TO THEM 
BUT ONE OF THEM SOMEHOW HAS MANAGED TO SEED ITSELF DOWN HERE 
JUST LOOK AT THIS 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CLUMP OF LIBERTIA PEREGRINANS 
IS THIS DARK DARK HELLEBORE 
LOOK AT THAT FLOWER 
IT JUST MAKES ME ECSTATIC 
FANTASTIC DARK FOLIAGE TOO 
AND WHAT A COMBINATION I COULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT 
I COULDN'T HAVE PLANNED IT ANY BETTER 
I COULDN'T HAVE PLANNED ANYTHING NEARLY AS GOOD 
IT'S SO LOVELY LIVING IN THE SOUTHWEST 
SO MANY OF THESE PLANTS REALLY THRIVE 
AND ONE OF THE SIGNS OF CLEAN AIR IS THIS MARVELLOUS LICHEN 
AND IT GROWS ALL OVER MY TREES 
ALL OVER THE MAGNOLIA AND THE CERCIS OVER THERE 
BUT IT'S EVEN CARPETED THIS BENCH 
AND IT'S JUST A WONDERFULLY CONTEMPLATIVE PLACE TO SIT AND THINK 
IT'S DREAMY 
OVER THE PAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
THE R. H. S. HAS BEEN OFFERING ITS MEMBERSHIP A FREE ADVISORY SERVICE 
IT GETS MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ENQUIRIES EVERY SINGLE YEAR 
AND GUY BARTER IS ONE OF ITS FIRST LINES OF DEFENCE 
AND MANY OF THE PROBLEMS HE'S ASKED ABOUT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR 
CONCERN CAMELLIAS 
AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR IN THE ADVISORY CENTRE AT WISLEY 
OUR POST BAGS ARE BULGING WITH CAMELLIA QUESTIONS 
AND THE COMMONEST ONE IS WHY ARE MY CAMELLIAS NOT FLOWERING 
THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT WHEN CAMELLIAS ARE LAYING DOWN THEIR BUDS 
IN LATER SUMMER EARLY AUTUMN 
IF THEY RUN SHORT OF WATER AT THAT TIME 
A WEAKNESS IS INTRODUCED INTO THE FLOWER AS IT FORMS 
AND THIS CAN RESULT IN EITHER NO FLOWER BEING FORMED AT ALL 
OR BUDS DROPPING OFF PREMATURELY 
NATURALLY THE REMEDY FOR THIS IS TO WATER 
AND THE BEST KIND OF WATER TO USE IS WATER FROM YOUR WATER BUTT 
BECAUSE CAMELLIAS LIKE AN ACID SOIL AND RAINWATER IS NATURALLY ACID 
CAMELLIAS UNDER TREES ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE 
HERE THE TREES ACT AS A KIND OF UMBRELLA KEEPING THE RAIN OFF 
AND THEIR ROOTS ROB THE SOIL OF MOISTURE 
SO WHEN YOU WATER UNDER TREES INDEED ANYWHERE 
JUST MAKE SURE THE WATER IS ACTUALLY SOAKING IN 
IT MIGHT REQUIRE MORE WATER THAN YOU THINK SO USE A TROWEL 
TO MAKE SURE IT'S GETTING DOWN TO A REASONABLE DEPTH TWENTY C. M. OR SO 
CAMELLIAS BENEFIT FROM A MULCH OF ORGANIC MATTER COMPOSTED BARK 
OR IF YOU CAN GET THEM PINE NEEDLES LAID ABOUT EIGHT C. M. DEEP 
USUALLY YOU PUT THOSE ON IN LATE WINTER TO TRAP THE WINTER RAIN 
AND THE SECOND MOST COMMON CAMELLIA PROBLEM 
IS YELLOWING OF THE FOLIAGE 
ONE OF THE CAUSES OF THIS IS CAMELLIA YELLOW MOTTLE VIRUS 
OUR GARDENERS HAVE FOUND THAT IF THEY CUT OUT THE INFECTED BITS 
THEN THE CAMELLIAS CARRY ON AND SURVIVE AND PERFORM QUITE WELL 
OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE TO GO BACK AND REMOVE THE YELLOW BITS EVERY YEAR 
BUT IT'S NOT USUALLY ENOUGH TO INHIBIT THE GROWTH OF THE CAMELLIA 
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO SPREAD THE VIRUS 
THE WAY TO AVOID IT IS TO SOAK A PIECE OF RAG IN HOUSEHOLD DISINFECTANT 
AND DEFTLY WIPE THE BLADES TO REMOVE ANY TRACE OF SAP 
THE THIRD COMMONEST PROBLEM THAT WE RECEIVE IS A SCALE INSECT 
THIS INSECT LIVES UNDERNEATH THE LEAVES AND SUCKS THE PLANT'S SAP 
PLANT SAP IS MOSTLY SUGAR 
AND THE SURPLUS SUGAR THE SCALE INSECT DOESN'T NEED 
IS EXCRETED AND FALLS TO THE LEAVES BELOW AS HONEYDEW 
THEY ACTUALLY DEVELOP WHAT'S CALLED A SOOTY MOULD 
IF YOU KEEP AN EYE ON THEM YOU CAN NIP THEM IN THE BUD LITERALLY 
BY USING YOUR THUMB NAIL TO SQUIDGE THEM 
IF THEY'RE TOO NUMEROUS FOR THAT WHAT WE USE HERE IS A SPRAYING OIL 
AN ORGANIC REMEDY THAT YOU APPLY TO COAT THE UNDERSIDE OF THE LEAVES 
AND THE OIL SUFFOCATES THE INSECTS 
DO ALL THIS AND THERE'S NO REASON 
WHY YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A FANTASTIC DISPLAY OF CAMELLIAS EVERY YEAR 
SO THAT'S ALL YOUR CAMELLIA PROBLEMS SORTED OUT 
NOW IF YOU LOVE CAMELLIAS ADORE THEM 
THEN MOUNT EDGCUMBE IS THE PLACE TO VISIT 
THERE ARE OVER ONE THOUSAND VARIETIES THERE 
AND ENTRANCE TO THE GARDENS IS ABSOLUTELY FREE 
BUT OUT OF THE WOODS AND INTO THE SUNSHINE 
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE CORNERS OF THE GARDEN 
IT'S WHAT I THINK OF AS MY SEASIDEY BIT 
IT BASKS IN SUN ALL THE TIME FACES SOUTH 
AND IT'S GOT THIS LITTLE WALL BEHIND IT 
AND ONE OF THE PLANTS THAT REALLY THRIVES IN HERE IS AGAPANTHUS 
NOW I'VE GOT THESE REALLY RATHER SORRY LOOKING CLUMPS 
IT'S THE ONE THAT PEOPLE USED TO CALL AFRICANUS 
AND IT'S THE ONE THAT YOU SEE DRAGGED IN AND OUT OF GREENHOUSES 
IN GREAT BIG TUBS THAT FLOWERS PROLIFICALLY 
WITH HUGE BIG FLOWERS AND BIG THICK BROAD LEAVES 
IT'LL DO FINE IN HERE IN THIS CORNER BECAUSE IT IS PROTECTED 
BUT I WANT TO ACCOMPANY IT WITH ANOTHER COUPLE OF AGAPANTHUS 
JUST TO RING THE CHANGES 
NOW THIS IS ONE OF THE CAMPANULATUS HYBRIDS 
THE CAMPANULATUS HYBRIDS ALWAYS LOSE THEIR LEAVES 
THEY'RE TOTALLY DECIDUOUS 
BUT THEY'RE REALLY REALLY TOUGH 
THEY HAVE MUCH NARROWER LEAVES 
THEY ALSO HAVE MORE ELEGANT SORT OF DAINTIER KIND OF FLOWERS 
YOU CAN SEE THE SORT OF HEIGHT OF THEM AND THE SIZE THEY WERE 
AND I ALWAYS LEAVE THE FLOWERS ON IF I CAN 
BECAUSE VERY OFTEN THEY'LL SET SEED 
AND THIS ONE HAS DONE JUST THAT 
AND IF YOU LOOK INSIDE THESE SEED CAPS 
YOU'LL SEE THIS MARVELLOUS SORT OF THEY'RE LIKE TADPOLES 
BLACK SEEDS 
AND THEY CAN BE SOWN ON THE TOP OF GRITTY COMPOST 
AND JUST WATERED WELL AND KEPT UNDER COVER UNTIL THEY GERMINATE 
TAKES A COUPLE OF YEARS UNTIL THEY FLOWER BUT WELL WORTH DOING 
SO BEFORE I PLANT THIS I'M GOING TO TAKE ALL THESE OFF CAREFULLY 
I'VE GOT A PAPER BAG HERE 
THEY'RE IN THE OLD ENVELOPE 
AND I SHALL JUST PLONK THEM INTO THERE 
JUST DO THEM A FEW AT A TIME 
I THINK THAT'S CAPTURED MOST OF THEM 
NOW YOU OFTEN HEAR OF AGAPANTHUS 
THAT HAVE BROKEN THE SIDES OF THE POT 
THAT PEOPLE CAN'T GET OUT AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE TOUGH TO GET OUT 
BUT JUST LOOK AT THAT 
WHAT SPLENDID ROOTS 
YOU CAN SEE WHY THEY BREAK THE POTS CAN'T YOU 
NOW THIS HAS GOT LOTS AND LOTS OF BUDS HERE 
AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE CLOSE TO THIS PLANT 
I THINK THAT SORT OF PROXIMITY REALLY HELPS 
BECAUSE THEY LIKE BEING CROWDED OUT IT HELPS THEM TO FLOWER BETTER 
THEY DON'T SPEND ALL THEIR TIME MAKING LOTS OF VEGETATIVE GROWTH 
THE SORT OF SOIL THAT AGAPANTHUS LIKES 
THEY LOVE MOISTURE 
ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S REASONABLY FREE DRAINING 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE STAGNANT 
NOW I CAN'T POSSIBLY SEPARATE ALL THESE ROOTS 
BUT I'LL JUST PULL A FEW OF THEM OUT FIRST 
AND I MIGHT EVEN STICK MY FORK IN 
LOOKS BRUTAL 
BUT I THINK IT'LL HELP IMMEDIATELY 
THOSE ROOTS WILL GET A CHANCE TO GO OUT INTO THE SOIL 
SO A NICE BIG HOE HERE 
REALLY GRITTY 
LOVELY 
JUST LOWER IT IN 
BIT OF COMPOST 
MIXED BACK WITH THE SOIL 
AND THAT SHOULD REALLY HELP SETTLE IT IN 
IT LOOKS PERFECTLY AT HOME 
NOW ONE OF THE PLACES 
THAT AGAPANTHUS AND ALL MANNER OF EXOTIC PLANTS 
ABSOLUTELY THRIVE AND LOVE LIVING 
IS IN SAINT MICHAEL'S MOUNT 
OFF THE COAST OF PENZANCE 
AND IT'S NOT ONLY THE PLANTS THAT GROW THERE 
THAT ARE EXTRAORDINARY 
WAIT TILL YOU SEE SOME OF THEIR GARDENING METHODS 
AN AMERICAN VISITOR ONCE SAID TO ME 
UNIQUE IS A MUCH OVERUSED WORD 
BUT IT'S THE BEST WORD TO DESCRIBE THIS 
I THOUGHT THAT REALLY SUMMED IT UP 
BEING HEAD GARDENER HERE IS A CHALLENGE 
EVERY SINGLE DAY IS DIFFERENT 
IT IS EXTREMELY EXPOSED 
WE'RE RIGHT DOWN THE END OF CORNWALL 
AND WE'RE RIGHT OUT IN THE OCEAN 
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH EXTREMES OF WEATHER EXTREMES OF TEMPERATURE 
IT'S NOT THE EASIEST GARDEN TO WORK IN 
BUT I'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD TEAM OF GARDENERS BEHIND ME TO HELP 
THIS IS THE EASTERN TERRACES 
MADE UP OF NINE DIFFERENT LEVELS 
CREATED BY EARLY STREAMING FOR TIN 
THE MAIN IDEA OF THE GARDENS IN GENERAL 
BUT CERTAINLY THE EASTERN TERRACES 
IS SO THAT THEY'RE ALL DESIGNED TO BE SEEN FROM THE CASTLE 
SO IF WE PLANTED THINGS LIKE FUCHSIAS FOR INSTANCE 
A HANGING DOWN FLOWER 
FROM UP THE CASTLE YOU SHAN'T SEE ANYTHING 
THE IDEA IS WE GO FOR PLANTS 
THAT HAVE LOTS OF COLOUR ON THE TOP AND SIDES 
ALL THE ARCHITECTURAL PLANTS LIKE THE AGAVE 
WE GIVE EVERYTHING A BIT OF ELBOW ROOM SO IT STANDS OUT FROM ABOVE 
IT REALLY IS UPSIDE DOWN GARDENING 
THIS IS AN AGAVE AMERICANA THIS WAS PLANTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN 
IT'S ORIGINALLY FROM MEXICO 
IT'S LOVES FULL SUN WELL DRAINED SOIL WHICH WE'VE GOT HERE 
ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS AGO WHEN WALKING AROUND THE GARDENS 
JUST TAKING SOME CUTTINGS AS WE USUALLY DO IN WINTER 
AND WE NOTICED THE FLOWER SPIKE COMING UP 
IT'S TAKEN EIGHT MONTHS FOR THE FLOWER SPIKE TO GET FROM A FEW FOOT 
TO GET TO THIS TWENTY FIVE FOOT MONSTER AS WE SEE IT NOW 
THESE ARE THE WALL GARDENS 
THESE WERE FIRST BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE FOR THE TWO DAUGHTERS OF THE FOURTH BARONET 
WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO IT KEEP EVERYTHING LOW 
UNDERNEATH THE WALL IF WE CAN 
THE MIDDLE WALL GARDEN GETS HIT REALLY BADLY IN THE WINTER STORMS 
WE LOSE A LOT OF THINGS HERE 
THE IDEA WAS TO KEEP IT LOW WITH A LOT OF PLANTING COMING UP FROM UNDERNEATH AS SEEN FROM ABOVE 
WE HAVE TO USE A ROPE AND HARNESS SYSTEM TO CLIMB DOWN THE CLIFF FACES 
TO REMOVE THE VEGETATION 
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW AGAVES THAT'VE BEEN PLANTED OVER THE YEARS 
WE DO HAVE A LOT OF SELF SEEDED SMALL SUCCULENTS THAT HAVE SELF SEEDED 
WE COME UP OCCASIONALLY AND WEED AROUND THEM JUST TO SHOW OFF THE ROCK FACE REALLY 
COMING INTO THE WESTERN TERRACES THE FIRST PLANT WE SEE OF INTEREST 
IS THE STRELITZIA REGINAE THE BIRD OF PARADISE PLANT 
AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A REAL GOOD EXAMPLE 
LOADS OF FLOWER ON IT THIS YEAR 
THIS IS NOT THE SORT OF PLANT YOU USUALLY SEE GROWING OUTSIDE 
IT'S USUALLY A CONSERVATORY PLANT BUT HERE WE ARE ON A WET WINDY CLIFF 
IN CORNWALL AND IT'S DOING VERY WELL 
WE'VE GOT AN ACONITUM HERE SELF SEEDED IN THE CRACK OF THE ROCK 
ONCE YOU'VE WEEDED AROUND IT THEY DO STAND OUT WELL 
ONCE IT HAS ITS FLOWER SPIKE COMING FROM THE CENTRE OF IT 
WITH NICE YELLOW FLOWER 
WE'VE ALSO GOT A PUYA ALPESTRIS 
IT'S A SMALL ONE WHICH HAS ALSO BEEN PLANTED IN THE ROCK FACE 
THEY DO STAND PRETTY WELL AGAINST THE GRANITE 
ONE OF THE REASONS WE CAN GET AWAY WITH EVERYTHING WE DO 
IS THE GRANITE THE NATURAL ROCK OF THE ISLAND 
UM IT'S LIKE A BIG STORAGE HEATER 
IT'S SOAKING UP ALL THE HEAT ALL DAY 
AND THEN IT'S RELEASING IT VERY SLOWLY AT NIGHT 
IT'S LIKE A MICRO CLIMATE EFFECT 
THAT'S HOW WE CAN GET AWAY WITH ALL THIS 
IT'S AN AMAZING PLACE TO BE A GARDENER 
I REALLY REALLY ENJOY WORKING HERE 
AND UM WE'RE GOING TO KEEP TRYING ALL THE NEW PLANTS WE CAN 
AS NEW THINGS COME FORWARD WE'RE GOING TO TRY THEM HERE 
TO TRY AND KEEP THIS SUB TROPICAL THEME GOING 
AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO THAT FOR MANY YEARS TO COME 
I'VE HAD A WONDERFUL DAY WORKING IN MY GARDEN 
I HOPE YOU ALL FEEL INSPIRED TO GET UP AT THE CRACK OF DAWN 
AND GET OUT THERE 
SOMETIMES THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE DAY ARE THE BEST TIMES TO SEE YOUR GARDEN 
WE'RE INVITING YOU ALL TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AT THOSE TIMES OF THE DAY 
OF YOUR OWN GARDEN AND SEND THEM IN TO THE WEBSITE 
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SHARE EACH OTHER'S GARDENS IN THAT WAY 
AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL PUT SOME OF THEM INTO THE PROGRAMME 
LATER ON IN THE SEASON 
NEXT WEEKEND IS EASTER WEEKEND ONE OF THE BUSIEST TIMES IN THE GARDEN 
GARDENERS' WORLD WILL BE BACK ON FRIDAY NIGHT AT EIGHT THIRTY P. M. 
FOR A HALF HOUR PROGRAMME 
MONTY'S GOING TO BE BACK AT BURYFIELDS IN THE LONG BORDERS 
MOVING SOME BIG PLANTS AND REARRANGING THINGS 
JOE'S GOING TO BE VISITING A GARDEN CENTRE 
AND I'M GOING TO VISIT ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING GARDENS I KNOW 
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
SO HAPPY SPRING AND HAPPY GARDENING 
YOU'VE BEEN THE ONE TO BEAT 
THERE IS NO COMPETITION 
NO ONE'S GONNA MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME 
DING DING ROUND TWO 
WHICH IS BETTER THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT 
THE BIGGEST NAMES IN BRITISH T. V. GO HEAD TO HEAD
