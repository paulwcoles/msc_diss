I'M JOHNNY KINGDOM AND I LOVE FILMING THE WONDERFUL WILDLIFE THAT LIVES NEAR MY HOME ON EXMOOR 
SOMETIMES I EVEN TAKE THE WIFE 
YOU ENJOYED IT DIDN'T YOU YES 
EH TELL THE CAMERA YOU ENJOYED IT 
I ENJOYED IT JOHN TALK TO THE CAMERA THERE I ENJOYED IT 
SINCE LAST YEAR I'VE BEEN SPENDING MOST OF THE TIME ON A PIECE OF LAND WE BOUGHT 
DOING ALL SORTS TO BRING IN THE BIRDS AND ANIMALS SO WE CAN FILM THEM AND MAKE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE 
BUT THIS WEEK IS GOING TO BE A REALLY REALLY HARD ONE FOR ME 
I'M TAKING A BREAK FROM THE LAND TO FACE TWO OF MY BIGGEST FEARS 
ONE IS HORSES 
NOW IT'S ME IN THERE AND THIS WILD ANIMAL THAT'S JUST COME OFF OF DARTMOOR 
AND THE OTHER IS FLYING 
CAN YOU SEE THAT 
THAT'S YOUR LIFT THAT'S YOUR RIDE 
I'M IN HERE 
AND I'M VERY VERY FRIGHTENED 
IT'S JULY AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THE RAIN WE'VE HAD 
IT HASN'T STOPPED FOR WEEKS 
COURSE I WANTED SOME RAIN BECAUSE WE HAD SUCH A DRY SPRING 
THE PLANTS AND ANIMALS ON MY LAND WERE REALLY REALLY STRUGGLING 
BUT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ALL CHANGING AGAIN 
AT LONG LAST WE GOT SOME SUNSHINE TO GET THE SUMMER REALLY GOING 
BACK IN MARCH I PLANTED THESE BUDDLEIAS 
HOPEFULLY HE'LL COME UP LIKE THAT AND WE'LL SEE SOME BUTTERFLIES 
D'YOU KNOW I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW THESE BUDDLEIAS HAVE GROWN AND THEY'RE FANTASTIC FOR BUTTERFLIES 
LOOK AT THAT THAT'S FANTASTIC BEAUTIFUL 
WE'VE GOT ALL SORTS FRITILLARIES RED ADMIRALS ALSO PEACOCKS 
AND OVER ON MY POND THERE'S MORE INSECTS 
DAMSEL FLIES AND I LOVE TO SEE THESE WHIRLIGIG BEETLES 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED ON IT SEVEN MONTHS AGO I WASN'T SURE HOW WELL THE POND WOULD WORK 
IT NEARLY DRIED OUT IN THE SPRING BUT THEN ALL THAT RAIN FILLED IT UP AGAIN AND NOW IT'S COME TO LIFE 
BUT WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR IS SOME BIRDS TO VISIT AND I THINK MY LUCK IS IN 
I'VE JUST SEEN THIS VERY BIG BIRD AND I'M ALMOST SURE HE'S A HERON 
YES IT'S DEFINITELY A GREY HERON 
IT'S IN MY POND 
WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT 
INCREDIBLE SHOT LOOK 
WHAT'S HE DOING LOOKING FOR A FISH 
MR. HERON THERE'S NO FISH IN THERE YET 
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW HE'S STALKING ALONG THERE LOOK 
WHAT'S HE AFTER 
HE GOT SOMETHING THEN YOU SEE 
HE'S LOOKING AT ME NOW I'VE GOT TO KEEP STILL 
HE'S SEEN ME I THINK 
HELLO 
HEY I'M JOHNNY 
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HERE TALKING SO LOUD 
TALKING SO LOUD TO AN HERON 
HE MUST FEEL SAFE 
BUT IT'S FANTASTIC HE'S ON MY LAND 
AND IT'S THE FIRST BIRD THAT I'VE SEEN COMING HERE 
BUT HE WON'T BE THE LAST 
WE'RE JUST AT THE BEGINNING 
AND FROM NOW ON I EXPECT TO SEE MORE AND MORE WILDLIFE COMING HERE 
RIGHT I'VE GOT TO GET OFF TO SEE A MATE WHO'S BEEN ASKING ME OVER FOR WEEKS 
I JUST HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO GO 
I GOT A CALL FROM JONATHAN MARSHALL 
HE'S A FALCONER HE'S A BIG FRIEND OF MINE 
THE LAST TIME I SAW JONATHAN I SAW HIS PEREGRINES THAT WAS GREAT 
BUT NOW HE'VE GOT SOMETHING ELSE TO SHOW ME 
AND KNOWING JONATHAN HE'S GOT SOMETHING UP HIS SLEEVE I'VE NO DOUBT 
I'M GOING TO MEET HIM ON THE NORTH DEVON COAST UP NEAR BIDEFORD 
I KNOW THAT HE'LL HAVE SOMETHING BIG PLANNED FOR ME 
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM HE SCARED THE LIFE OUT OF ME WITH HIS PEREGRINES 
GOOD TO SEE YOU HOW'S IT GOING 
OH I SEE SO WHAT'S HAPPENING 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS GO AND STAND OVER IN THE FIELD OVER THERE ABOUT TWENTY METRES FACING THE SEA 
STICK YOUR ARM IN THE AIR LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER LIKE THAT YEAH 
YEAH YOU CAN WHISTLE IF YOU LIKE 
WHISTLE OR SHOUT HELP WHICHEVER YOU WANT TO DO 
STRAIGHT OVER THERE YOU'LL LOVE THIS 
RIGHT OVER THERE HOW FAR YEAH RIGHT OVER ON THE EDGE 
I'M SHAKING LIKE A LEAF 
THAT'S PERFECT THERE JOHNNY 
GIVE US A WHISTLE 
WHOA OH JOHNNY I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT 
O. K. HEY HEY MATE 
HEY HEY 
STEADY BOY STEADY 
NICE AND STILL THAT'S IT 
O. K. MATE 
GOOD CHRIST HE'S BIG STEADY JOHNNY HE'S HAVING MY ARM OFF 
I KNEW YOU'D HAVE SOMETHING JOHN BUT I WASN'T EXPECTING A GOLDEN EAGLE ON ME ARM 
RIGHT GO OVER THERE COME ON THEN 
COME OVER HERE THIS SIDE THOUGH 
COME THIS SIDE SO YOU'RE UPWIND OF HIM THAT'S IT 
WELL THAT FEELS BETTER FOR ME NOW 
THAT'S QUITE HEAVY JOHN WHERE DID HE COME FROM 
WELL ESSENTIALLY HE WAS A RESCUED BIRD HE WAS BRED IN CAPTIVITY AND WHEN I GOT SAMSON 
HE'D COME FROM A BAD HOME AND HE WAS QUITE AGGRESSIVE TO BE HONEST 
SO I HAD TO SPEND WEEKS AND WEEKS WITH HIM GETTING HIM USED TO ME 
AND BUILDING UP TRUST AND BASICALLY A BOND 
BECAUSE HE'D NEVER FLOWN BEFORE NEVER IN HIS LIFE 
HE'D ALWAYS BEEN KEPT IN A CAGE IN A ZOO 
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THE FIRST TIME I BROUGHT HIM UP ON THESE CLIFFS AND LET HIM GO MY HEART WAS RACING 
I WAS PULSING AND HE WENT OFF OVER THE BEACH AND OVER AND HE WENT UP VERY VERY HIGH AND I WATCHED HIM 
I WAS KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED AND PRAYING THAT HE'D COME BACK 
AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES I PUT MY GLOVE ON AND GAVE HIM A BIG WHISTLE 
HE TURNED AND HE SWOOPED DOWN TO MY GLOVE 
AND I TELL YOU WHAT I CRIED LIKE A BABY IT WAS FANTASTIC 
SO WHAT SORT OF STRENGTH 
WHAT SORT OF POWER HAS IT GOT 
RIGHT ER 
HE'S UNBELIEVABLY POWERFUL 
IF YOU JUST LOOK AT HIS TALONS HERE THE ACTUAL PRESSURE IN EACH TOE IS TEN ZERO ZERO ZERO L. B. PER SQUARE INCH 
AND TO PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT YOU KNOW THESE PIT BULL TERRIERS 
THE FIGHTING DOGS THEY'VE GOT A HELL OF A BITE ABOUT FIVE ZERO ZERO ZERO L. B. PRESSURE 
SO HIS IS DOUBLE THE PRESSURE IN HIS TOES 
ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL STRENGTH 
WELL I CAN SEE WHY JONATHAN LOVES SAMSON 
BUT HE HASN'T GOT ME ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE JUST TO SHOW ME THAT EAGLE 
HE'LL BE UP TO SOMETHING ELSE I KNOW 
I ALWAYS HAD THIS DREAM OF FLYING WITH A GOLDEN EAGLE 
NO ONE'S EVER DONE IT AND I WANTED TO BE THE FIRST PERSON TO EVER FLY WITH A GOLDEN EAGLE 
AND I DID IT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY JOHNNY IS GET YOU TO GET UP AND ACTUALLY FLY WITH SAMSON 
I CAN'T YOU'RE JOKING I DON'T LIKE HEIGHTS MAN I DON'T LIKE HEIGHTS 
NO YOU'LL BE FINE HONESTLY 
LISTEN CAREFULLY YOU CAN HEAR BUZZING 
JUST LOOK OVER THERE LOOK CAN YOU SEE THAT 
I CAN SEE IT THAT'S YOUR LIFT THAT'S YOUR RIDE 
IT'LL LAND OVER THERE IT'S TOO SMALL MAN 
WE'LL GET YOU KITTED UP WITH A HELMET ON 
DON'T WORRY WE'LL GIVE YOU KNEEPADS 
AND I'M GOING TO LET SAMSON GO 
YOU'RE JOKING AND HE'LL FLY WITH YOU 
I DON'T FEEL THAT GOOD ALREADY 
YOU'LL BE O. K. I DON'T LIKE HEIGHTS 
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT GO ON JOHNNY 
GO OVER THERE WE'LL GET KITTED UP 
ENJOY THE FLIGHT IT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH 
GO ON MATE YOU'LL LOVE THIS 
IT'S GREAT FANTASTIC 
HE'S TERRIFIED 
YEAH HE IS 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS AT ALL 
WHAT JONATHAN SAYS HE'S DONE IS TRAIN THE EAGLE TO FLY ALONGSIDE THE MICROLIGHT 
IF I'M LUCKY HE SAYS I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET SOME SHOTS OF SAMSON FLYING NEXT TO ME 
LANCE HELLO JOHN WELL WELL 
I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE ME UP THERE IF YOU FANCY IT 
I DON'T FANCY IT REALLY I AM VERY NERVOUS 
I'LL TELL YOU THAT NOW BECAUSE 
WHAT'S THAT I'VE GOT TO WEAR THIS HAVE I 
THE MICROLIGHT HAS GOT A CAMERA FITTED TO IT 
SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE ME WHILE I'M TRYING TO FILM THE EAGLE 
CAN YOU GIVE ME A HAND TO GET THIS ON BECAUSE I DON'T 
WHAT DO I DO 
I'VE HAD THESE SORT OF THINGS BEFORE IS THAT THE LEFT ONE 
WELL THAT'S IT THAT WAS HARD HARD WORK 
IT TOOK A LONG LONG TIME 
WHERE D'YOU WANT TO GO BACK OR FRONT 
WELL IN THE BACK I AIN'T THE PILOT 
WELL I'M IN HERE 
AND I'M VERY VERY FRIGHTENED 
BUT NEVER MIND D'YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IN LIFE YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE A CHANCE OR TWO HAVEN'T YOU 
BUMPETY UMPETY UMPETY 
OOH 
OOH OH MY HEAD 
I DON'T BELIEVE I'M UP HERE 
OH DEAR COULD DO WITH A GOOD WHISKY 
TO GET THE BEST SHOTS OF SAMSON I NEED TO HAVE SOME DECENT WIND 
BECAUSE WITHOUT IT HE CAN'T FLY HIGH ENOUGH 
JONATHAN HAS WARNED ME THOUGH THAT TODAY HE'S NOT SURE WHETHER THE WIND WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH 
HE'S GOT THE EAGLE ON HIS ARM READY TO GO 
THAT'S HIS SHADOW WHERE'S HE TO 
I CAN'T EVEN SEE THE BUGGER 
I CAN'T SEE IT 
THERE IT IS JUST OVER THE FIELD 
YES I CAN SEE HIM NOW 
I CAN'T GET THAT SHOT 
THE CAMERA'S THE WRONG ANGLE I CAN'T GET THE BLOODY SHOT 
D'YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT SHOULDER BELT OFF 
NO NO NO NO 
THERE HE IS LOOK HE'S JUST OVER THE EDGE THERE HE'S HOVERING 
LOOK AT THAT SEE THAT HAS HE GONE BELOW US 
HERE I AM ABOVE A GOLDEN EAGLE I DON'T BELIEVE IT 
THAT'S A NICE SHOT 
OH HE'S COMING ROUND AGAIN 
WELL WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANY CLOSER THAN THIS 
JONATHAN WAS RIGHT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH WIND 
HE'S LANDED LOOK 
GOT HIM THE GOLDEN EAGLE THEN WENT STRAIGHT DOWN 
INTO A BLINKING HEDGE 
OH 
BLOODY HELL WE'RE TURNING OVER 
WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA 
OH HE'S LANDED 
WE'RE GONNA COME DOWN 
WE WANT TO LAND 
AHH HA 
OH I TELL YOU ONE THING 
I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE 
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT JOHNNY 
WELL FANTASTIC JOHN 
YOU WANT TO FEEL MY HEART I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE 
I DID TAKE SOME WHISKY WITH ME BUT I COULDN'T GET IT OUT THE POCKET 
THE THINGS I DO FOR FILMING 
IT WASN'T THAT BAD BUT I SHAN'T BE GOING UP THERE AGAIN IN A HURRY 
WELL I'VE JUST HEARD SOME VERY VERY BAD NEWS 
I'VE LOST A GREAT FRIEND 
MY MATE TONY THORNE 
HE WAS SO CLOSE A FRIEND TO ME AND HE'S GOING TO BE MISSED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE 
SPECIALLY ME AND ALBERT HIS OTHER MATE 
ALL THE BEST 
COURSE YOU'VE MET HIM TOO 
HE'S BEEN IN A FEW OF MY PROGRAMMES 
REMEMBER THAT ONE WITH MY TOE 
YOU TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT TOE MY WIFE SAID IT'S OW 
THIS NAIL'S TURNED RIGHT ROUND THE CORNER INNIT 
YOU CAN SEE A LOT AND YOU ONLY GOT ONE EYE 
I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF IT SO YOU ADVISE ME WHAT TO DO 
PULL THE NAIL RIGHT OFF AND START AGAIN NO AND START AGAIN 
THAT NAIL'S ROTTEN LOOK 
D'YOU KNOW IT WAS ONLY A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT I SPENT MY LAST HOURS WITH TONY IN THIS HIDE 
WE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME 
WE DIDN'T SEE A LOT BUT HE ENJOYED IT 
AND I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT NIGHT NEVER 
I'LL HAVE A COUPLE OF WEEKS HOLIDAY DOWN HERE THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO 
TONY WAS LIKE ME 
HE SPENT ALL HIS LIFE ON EXMOOR WORKING ON THE FARM HE GREW UP IN 
THERE'S NOT MANY LEFT LIKE HIM 
WELL THOU'S MAKING A BIT OF NOISE I WAS HOPING TO SEE SOME WILDLIFE 
WELL THEY LIKE SOME NOISE BUT THE DEER DON'T 
NO BUT THEY DON'T MIND A BIT 
I ALWAYS FOUND THE MORE NOISE YOU MAKE THE MORE YOU SEE 
D'YOU THINK SO YES 
YES I DO I DO 
JOHN'S FEELING REALLY REALLY UPSET 
HE'S BEEN A BIT OF A LOST SOUL REALLY 
I THINK HE'S FELT THE EMPTINESS QUITE A BIT 
COURSE I'VE KNOWN TONY SINCE SCHOOLDAYS SO 
AND HE WAS SUCH A KIND NICE MAN 
LOVELY TO TALK TO VERY INTERESTING 
AND HE HAS BEEN PART OF OUR LIVES FOR A LONG TIME AND I WILL MISS HIM VERY MUCH 
JOHN'S HAD AN OFFER TO GO TO DARTMOOR TO SEE THE PONIES THERE 
AND I'M SURE IF HE COULD GET INTO THE SWING OF THINGS AGAIN IT WOULD DO HIM THE WORLD OF GOOD 
LAST TIME I SAW ANY DARTMOOR PONIES WAS SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN TIMES WERE REALLY HARD 
THE PONY OWNERS WERE STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR THEIR UPKEEP AND THE BREED WAS DYING OUT 
BUT THINGS HAVE IMPROVED SINCE THEN 
I'M VISITING THE DARTMOOR PONY HERITAGE TRUST 
IT'S A CHARITY THAT FINDS WAYS OF HELPING THE OWNERS TO KEEP THE BREED GOING 
EXCUSE ME 
DRU OR VANESSA ANYBODY THERE PLEASE HI JOHNNY COME ON IN 
DRU BUTTERFIELD RUNS THE TRUST 
AND SHE WORKS WITH VANESSA BEE A HORSE TRAINER 
ONE THING THEY DO IS TRAIN SOME OF THE YOUNG PONIES SO THEY CAN BE SOLD FOR CHILDREN'S RIDING PONIES 
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT ME TO HAVE A GO AT 
SO WHERE DO WE GO NOW 
ONLY PROBLEM IS I'M SCARED OF HORSES' 
IT'S THE FIRST HANDLING WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ANY TRAINING ANY PONY 
AND WE THE FIRST TIME WE LAY A HAND ON THAT PONY 
IT'S DONE WITH LOVE AND TENDERNESS AND SOFTNESS BUT IT'S NOT SOPPY 
IT'S IN THE HEART ISN'T IT OH IT'S IN THE HEART 
AND IT'S REALLY GETTING A ROPE ON THE PONY 
WHEN IT'S READY TEACHING IT TO GIVE TO THE PRESSURE WHICH I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU TO DO 
AND THEN GET A HALTER ON AND WITHIN A SHORT LENGTH OF TIME ANYTHING BETWEEN 
OUR RECORD WAS SIX MINUTES 
BETWEEN SIX AND FIFTEEN MINUTES WE WILL HAVE THAT PONY LEADING OUT WITH THESE OTHER PONIES IN THIS YARD 
WHAT I'M DOING INSIDE HERE IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO THIS WORK 
MY ADRENALINE IS DOWN 
MY HEART RATE IS DOWN AND I'M BREATHING 
BUT I REALLY AM THINKING CALM THOUGHTS 
ANYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED OUTSIDE THE PEN 
OR ANYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING OUTSIDE THE PEN WE NEED TO FORGET NOW 
BECAUSE IT'S NOW I'VE GOT TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THIS HORSE 
O. K. 
VANESSA SAYS THE MAIN THING IS TO GET THE PONY TO TRUST YOU AND FEEL SAFE WITH YOU 
I'M JUST GOING TO REST THAT THERE TO CALM HER DOWN A LITTLE BIT 
IT'S QUITE A BIT TO LEARN REALLY IF THEY WANT ME TO TRY AND DO THIS 
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THIS IS A YEARLING 
AND IT'S BEEN ON DARTMOOR FOR OVER TWELVE MONTHS RUNNING WILD 
HE ONLY COME IN A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO FROM THE WILD INTO THIS PEN HERE 
THERE YOU GO AND THEN WE TAKE THE STICK OUT AND JUST LET THE ROPE DRAPE ON HER NECK 
THIS LADY VANESSA'S IN THERE NOW AND SHE'S EVEN TOUCHING IT UNDER TEN MINUTES 
I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLE STUFF BECAUSE I'LL BE HONEST I'VE NEVER EVER BEEN A FRIEND OF HORSES 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID OF THEM 
AND SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG TRIAL FOR ME ANYWAY SO 
TO GO IN THE PEN THAT THERE'S NO ESCAPE AND THEY CAN JUMP AT YOU 
WELL IT'S MY TURN NOW 
O. K. FRIEND 
I PICKED ON YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR WHITE FOOT 
SO WHEN I GET IN THERE YOU COULD BE REALLY REALLY WILD 
AND YOU COULD LASH OUT 
MAKE SURE MY HELMET IS ON O. K. O. K. 
O. K. 
NOW O. K. 
I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU YOU KNOW 
NOW LOOK 
WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY NOW IS PUT A ROPE OVER THE HEAD OF THIS WILD ANIMAL 
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK EASY BUT I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU MY FRIEND 
ALL I WANT TO DO IS PUT THIS ON YOUR HEAD YEAH 
O. K. I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU I PROMISE
