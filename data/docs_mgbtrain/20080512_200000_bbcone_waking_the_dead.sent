FIND OUT ABOUT SOMEWHERE A BIT BETTER FOR YOU TO 
FIND OUT ABOUT SOMEWHERE A BIT BETTER FOR YOU TO 
LOOK FOR THE LAST TIME I DON'T KNOW HER 
JIMMY 
ARGH 
ARGH 
HI HI YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE MINES 
SO THE BODY'S IN A CHAMBER ACCESSED BY A TUNNEL OVER THERE WHAT D'YOU MEAN A CHAMBER 
THERE WAS A BIG ROAD PROTEST IN NINETY FIVE WITH PROTESTORS CHAINING THEMSELVES TO TREES HANGING OUT IN TUNNELS 
THEY LIVED UNDERGROUND YEAH FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS 
YEAH IT TOOK THE POLICE AGES TO EVICT THEM 
SO THIS CREDIT CARD IS THE ONLY I. D. AT THE MOMENT YEAH BIT CONVENIENT 
CERTAINLY IS I'LL CHECK THE SITE MANAGER SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER ACCESS O. K. 
GRACE I'VE RIGGED UP A MONITOR ON THIS LAPTOP TO CONNECT TO THE CAMERA IN MY HELMET 
OH OH SO I DON'T GET TO CRAWL DOWN ANY TUNNELS NO 
HOW MUCH CRAWLING IS THERE THERE'S A FAIR BIT IT'S LIMITED IN SOME SPACES 
YOU'LL NEED THESE TO STOP CROSS CONTAMINATION YOU'LL BE ON ALL FOURS HOW LIMITED 
IT REALLY IS LIMITED ISN'T IT 
ER RIGHT GOING IN GRACE 
BE CAREFUL DOWN THERE 
YEAH I THINK IT'S JUST THROUGH HERE 
THERE HE IS 
IN THE CHAMBER GRACE 
THERE'S SOMETHING COMING THROUGH NOW 
IT LOOKS LIKE A WOUNDED ANIMAL 
A BEAUTIFUL SPECIMEN OF ADIPOCERE 
WHAT ADIPOCERE GRAVE WAX CAUSED BY HYDROLYSIS OF FATS IN THE BODY 
TAKES SEVERAL MONTHS OF WARM WET CONDITIONS FOR IT TO FORM 
AIR VENTILATION SHAFTS ARE BLOCKED 
YEAH AND THERE 
AND ANOTHER ONE THERE SO HE SUFFOCATED DID HE 
NO THIS IS ALMOST CERTAINLY WHAT KILLED HIM BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO THE RIGHT PARIETAL BONE 
GRACE THE BODY'S IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION SEATED 
HANDS AND FEET ARE TIED WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE PLASTIC COATED ROPE 
YEAH THERE'S SOMETHING IN HIS HANDS TOO 
YEAH IT'S WHAT LOOKS LIKE A. 
CAN OF SARDINES 
PLASTIC EXTRUSION BAG 
U. GRO GARDEN CENTRE LOGO 
DENTAL RECORDS ARE A MATCH 
GREAT SO THIS IS CHRISTOPHER DEARDEN FORTY ONE MARRIED ONE SON WORKED FOR AN AIR CONDITIONING 
COMPANY IN SOUTH LONDON HE WENT MISSING ON TWENTY FOUR MAY NINETEEN NINETY SIX 
FROM AN ACCOUNT MADE BY HIS WIFE HE MADE REGULAR WORK TRIPS TO NIGERIA 
AND HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO A CONFERENCE ON COOLER UNITS IN LAGOS 
THE INVESTIGATION SAID THERE WAS NO FLIGHT BOOKED PLUS HE LEFT HIS PASSPORT AT HOME 
NOT IF HE WAS GOING TO LAGOS EXACTLY 
FRANK MONK THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER SAID HE FOUND HIS PASSPORT IN DEARDEN'S SHED 
UNDERSTANDABLE HE'S A GARDENER SO HE HAD ACCESS 
YEAH IT'S AN ODD PLACE TO LEAVE YOUR PASSPORT 
BECAUSE OF THE PASSPORT AND HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND THAT HE WAS DRINKING HEAVILY AND DEPRESSED 
THEY CONCLUDED IT WAS SUICIDE 
WHICH IT WASN'T WAS IT EVE COS HE WAS KILLED AND DUMPED IN THIS BURIAL SITE 
WELL HARDLY DUMPED 
O. K. HE WAS PLACED OR WHATEVER SITTING WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY AND THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS 
SEVERAL BLOWS TO THE SKULL RESULTING IN AN EXTRADURAL HAEMATOMA 
O. K. NOW THESE BAGS FROM THE GARDEN CENTRE WHAT'VE YOU GOT ON THEM 
I'M CHECKING IT OUT U. GRO NURSERIES HAVE SEVENTEEN SITES ACROSS THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND 
I ALSO FOUND BLOOD IN THE BAGS SAME BLOOD GROUP AS DEARDEN 
SO THESE BAGS WERE USED TO CARRY THE BODY TO THIS SITE POSSIBLY I TOOK SAMPLES 
FROM THE BODY AND THE BAG WHICH I'VE SENT OFF TO KEW BUT 
INDICATIONS SUGGEST THAT THE SOIL WAS TOO ALKALINE FOR THE AREA 
SO THEY KILLED HIM ELSEWHERE THEN CARRIED THE BODY 
MAYBE MAYBE IT WAS SOME KIND OF GANGLAND THING YOU KNOW A WARNING 
IF A WARNING WHY HIDE SOMEONE YOU'D PUT THEM IN PLAIN SIGHT 
I'M NOT SURE IT'S BEEN HIDDEN 
LOOK HOW THE BODY WAS PLACED AND HIS HANDS WERE BEHIND HIM AND HE WAS HOLDING THAT TIN OF SARDINES 
IT COULD'VE BEEN OFFERINGS GIFTS FOR THE AFTERLIFE LIKE THE VIKINGS AND THE EGYPTIANS 
O. K. THIS SITE WAS CREATED BY THESE PROTESTORS WHO DIDN'T WANT 
THE DIGGERS TO GO THROUGH THE LAST PROTESTOR TO BE EVICTED WAS IN OCTOBER NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
DEARDEN DISAPPEARED EIGHT MONTHS LATER SO HE'S NOT RELATED TO THEM 
THEY MUST'VE KNOWN THE TUNNELS SO MAYBE THERE IS SOME CORRELATION 
I'M REALLY SORRY IT'S JUST 
OH IT'S JUST SILLY ISN'T IT 
I MEAN WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN ONE DAY IT'S JUST THAT 
HOW SOON CAN YOU RELEASE THE BODY 
SO THE FAMILY CAN MAKE ARRANGEMENTS YOU KNOW 
CAN I CLARIFY SOMETHING HERE 
IN THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION IT STATED THAT YOU WERE A FAMILY FRIEND 
BUT I'M GETTING THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU'RE PART OF THE FAMILY 
YEAH WE WERE AT SCHOOL TOGETHER AND 
LUCY CONTACTED ME TO DO SOME WORK IN THE GARDEN I'M A LANDSCAPER 
JIMMY 
OH JIMMY HELLO IT'S ABOUT DAD ISN'T IT 
YES WE'VE FOUND YOUR FATHER'S BODY 
WHERE 
SHEPTON 
THERE ARE SOME OLD TUNNELS THERE DO YOU KNOW THEM 
MRS. DEARDEN YES THANK YOU 
WHEN YOUR HUSBAND DISAPPEARED YOU SAID HE WAS DEPRESSED DISTANT AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT 
SHOULD WE BE DISCUSSING THIS IN FRONT OF JIMMY YES 
DO YOU THINK HIS EMOTIONAL STATE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOU WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR 
YOU WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR 
IT STARTED A LONG TIME BEFORE THAT 
THE AFFAIR OR THE DEPRESSION THE DEPRESSION 
LOOK IF THIS WAS SUICIDE WHY ARE WE GOING THROUGH ALL THIS AGAIN 
WHEN WE DISCOVERED THE BODY 
IT BECAME APPARENT THAT HE'D BEEN MURDERED 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING OUT JIMMY JIMMY 
LEAVE HIM LOOK LEAVE HIM 
I'LL SEE TO HIM O. K. 
HI LUKE IT'S ME 
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO 
FIND OUT ABOUT SOMEWHERE A BIT BETTER FOR YOU TO

FOR A TIME WE HAD THE WHOLE THING ROLLING BACKWARDS 
HOW LONG WERE YOU THERE

YEAH COURSE WELL SO DID YOUR LOT THEY WEREN'T ANY BIG SECRET WERE THEY 
I'VE GOT A LIST OF SOME OF THE PROTESTORS WE'VE TRACED ARE YOU IN CONTACT WITH ANY OF THEM NO 
ANYBODY THAT'S NOT ON THE LIST 
GO ON HAVE A LOOK 
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT HAVE A LOOK

A CHRISTOPHER DEARDEN DO YOU KNOW HIM 
WELL HOPEFULLY IT'S THE DICKHEAD THAT PULLED MY GIRLFRIEND OH YEAH 
LEFT MY WIFE KIDS EVERYTHING WE'D BARELY GOT THERE AND SHE 
DISAPPEARED WITH THIS BLOKE WEARING RIBBONS HORRIBLE 
NO I DON'T KNOW HIM 
WHILE YOU WERE THERE DID YOU TAKE PART IN ANY RITUALS 
I DID A BIT OF LINKING HANDS DANCING NAKED FOR THE SOLSTICE 
WERE YOU AWARE OF ANY SACRIFICES OR BURIALS 
WELL THERE WAS A HARDCORE WHO WANTED TO PUSH THINGS TO THE LIMITS 
THEY'D HAVE SACRIFICED A VIRGIN IF THEY COULD 
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE THEY DIDN'T 
NO VIRGINS 
WE DON'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA JIMMY I WANT TO SEE THE BODY 
O. K. JIMMY JUST WAIT OUTSIDE GIVE ME ONE MINUTE THANKS 
JIMMY DOESN'T BELIEVE HIS FATHER'S DEAD AND HE NEEDS TO FACE REALITY 
SO YOU'LL HIT HIM WITH A CORPSE THAT'S BEEN ROTTING IN A TUNNEL 
WE CAN'T PROTECT HIM THERE'S NO HAPPY ENDING 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE'S NOT A CHILD 
HE WANTS TO SEE HIS FATHER'S BODY 
IF THAT HELPS HIM COME TO TERMS WITH IT 
SHOULDN'T HE REMEMBER HIS FATHER HOW HE WAS HE HAS TO GRIEVE 
I DON'T SEE THE POINT OF SHOWING HIM A BAG OF BONES 
I WILL MAKE SURE HE KNOWS WHAT TO EXPECT 
JIMMY WILL YOU COME WITH ME PLEASE 
NOT YOU MR. MONK 
YOU WON'T LET HIM GO ON HIS OWN 
HE'S JUST A BOY HE'S NOT ON HIS OWN 
MAYBE I SHOULD GO WITH HIM DID HE SAY THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED 
DO THEY EVER 
READY 
WHY IS HE SITTING UP 
THAT'S HOW WE FOUND HIM 
JIMMY 
JIMMY JIMMY 
WE CAN GO NOW 
THAT'S NOT MY DAD 
JIMMY WE KNOW IT IS THAT'S NOT MY DAD MY DAD IS IN AFRICA 
I FOUND THIS IN DEARDEN'S BODY 
IT'S SOME SORT OF LOCKET IT'S BRONZE AND I'M RUNNING TESTS TO DISCOVER ITS ORIGIN O. K. 
CONTAINED INSIDE IT I ALSO FOUND SOME POWDER WHICH I'M TESTING 
WHAT POWDER AS IN DRUGS POSSIBLY 
DEARDEN'S BONES 
RIGHT THEY HAD A MUCH SPONGIER APPEARANCE THAN I'D EXPECT TO FIND IN A MAN OF HIS AGE 
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING BRITTLE BONES RIGHT OSTEOPOROSIS 
I'VE COME TO SEE JIMMY YOU'VE SEEN HIM NOW LEAVE O. K. 
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM WHY TAKE HIM TO SEE HIS FATHER'S BODY HE WANTED TO GO HE'S AN IMPRESSIONABLE KID 
HE'S NOT A KID HE'S NINETEEN YEARS OLD AND WHAT'S IT GOT TO DO WITH YOU 
YOU STAY OUT OF MY FAMILY'S BUSINESS YEAH 
YOUR FAMILY YOUR FAMILY 
LOOK AT YOU YEAH 
PLAYING THE BIG MAN IN YOUR SHITHOLE 
WITH ALL YOUR BUNCH OF LOSERS 
ALL RIGHT BOYS 
YOU ALL RIGHT 
YOU ALL RIGHT 
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE 
NO 
IT MIGHT BE CHRIS'S 
I DON'T KNOW I'VE NEVER SEEN IT 
TOWARDS THE END WE WEREN'T 
WE WEREN'T VERY CLOSE SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IF HE WAS ILL 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
HE HAD OSTEOPOROSIS 
YEAH THE POST MORTEM FOUND THAT HE HAD THIS BONE DISEASE 
AND YOU HAD NO IDEA IS THAT A YES OR A NO DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA 
NO NO THANK YOU 
WHY DOES JIMMY THINK THAT HIS FATHER HAS BEEN IN AFRICA ALL THIS TIME 
BECAUSE HE FINDS IT VERY HARD TO ACCEPT THAT HIS DAD'S DEAD 
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE ISN'T IT 
LOOK CHRIS WORKED AWAY A LOT HE WAS ALWAYS WORKING IN AFRICA 
AND HE USED TO FILL JIMMY'S HEAD WITH STORIES 
HE USED TO SAY THINGS LIKE HE WAS WORKING UNDERCOVER FOR THE NIGERIANS OR I DUNNO HE WAS HAVING SECRET 
MEETINGS GOING TO SPECIAL TRAINING CAMPS AND JIMMY WOULD JUST BELIEVE THEM 
HELLO WHAT'S THAT 
IT'S STUFF FROM THE BONFIRE 
IT'S MY DAD'S STUFF 
WHY ARE YOU BURNING IT THEN 
WHAT'S IT TO YOU 
MIND IF I SIT DOWN 
FRANK BURNT IT 
FRANK BURNT IT 
YEAH 
OH 
DO YOU RECOGNISE THIS 
IT'S MY DAD'S 
GOT IT ON HIS LAST TRIP TO AFRICA 
SAID A WITCH DOCTOR GAVE IT TO HIM 
I WANT TO HELP YOU JIMMY 
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FATHER 
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 
WHAT HAPPENED 
HE WAS WORKING WITH A GROUP CALLED THE AWKWARD SQUAD 
AWKWARD SQUAD WHAT'S THAT 
I CAN'T SAY IT'S SECRET 
I UNDERSTAND 
SO WHAT WAS YOUR DAD DOING WITH THEM 
IT WAS SOME SORT OF MERCENARY 
I'M NOT SURE 
TOLD ME THAT HE WANTED TO PROTECT ME 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE ME A TARGET 
SO YOUR DAD WAS IN AFRICA WORKING WITH THIS MERCENARY GROUP 
HE SAID HE 
WAS GOING OVER TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT 
AND THAT HE'D SORT THINGS OUT AND THEN HE'D COME BACK TO ME 
AND YOU THINK HE'S STILL IN AFRICA 
WHAT THE HELL HAS THIS TO DO WITH YOU 
IT'S A MURDER INVESTIGATION AND YOU WERE DESTROYING EVIDENCE RELEVANT TO THAT INVESTIGATION 
BUT IT HAD BEEN THERE FOR YEARS IT WAS JUST JUNK 
LIKE BOOKS AND MAPS JIMMY WASTED HOURS IN THERE 
SO YOU DID IT TO STOP JIMMY WASTING HIS TIME 
WHY DOES EVERYBODY SEEM TO THINK THEY KNOW HOW TO RAISE MY KID HE'S NOT YOUR KID 
YOU SEE THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT DEARDEN DISAPPEARS YOU'RE ALREADY 
HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH MRS. DEARDEN AND THEN AS SOON AS HIS BODY REAPPEARS YOU START BUILDING BONFIRES 
I WAS ANGRY WITH WHAT 
LOOK I'D SPENT TEN YEARS TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO THIS KID 
TRYING TO CONNECT WITH HIM 
THEN WITH THIS BODY I FIND OUT THAT THE REASON I'M THERE IS COS THIS GUY COLERIDGE REFUSED TO TAKE HIM 
WHO'S COLERIDGE HE'S JIMMY'S BOSS 
HE'S LIKE SOME BIG HERO TO HIM 
AND WE END UP IN A FIGHT WHICH IS WHY I'VE GOT 
YEAH I WAS WONDERING WHAT THAT WAS H. M. M. 
SO WHAT WAS THE FIGHT ABOUT HE DOESN'T THINK I'M FIT TO REPLACE JIMMY'S DAD 
SO HE KNEW CHRIS DEARDEN 
YEAH CHRIS USED TO TAKE JIMMY DOWN THE YOUTH CENTRE WHEN HE WAS A KID 
YEAH HE GOT A SLAP ROUND THE FACE 
IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN HE DESERVED OH 
NICE JAB HE'S GOT TALENT THAT KID 
YEAH HE'S GOT ANGER HE USED TO TAKE IT OUT ON HIMSELF NOW HE CHANNELS IT 
THAT'S JIMMY OVER THERE RIGHT O. K. 
I'M GONNA GO AND 
CAN HE BOX HE'S DECKED A FEW PEOPLE IN HIS TIME YEAH 
SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH FRANK MONK WHAT WAS IT ABOUT 
HE TOOK JIMMY TO SEE HIS FATHER'S BODY AND THEN BURNT HIS POSSESSIONS WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU DONE THIS FIFTEEN YEARS 
I GIVE THEM SOMETHING OF WHAT IT TAKES TO BE MEN 
IT TAKES MORE THAN KNOWING HOW TO HIT TO BE A MAN DOESN'T IT 
THIS GUY LOST THREE YEARS OF HIS LIFE TO CRACK COCAINE NOW LOOK AT HIM 
OH RIGHT BUT THEY'RE NOT ALL ADDICTS ARE THEY 
NO NO BUT THEY'RE NOT THE MOST COMMUNICATIVE BUNCH 
SO WHEN THEY WANT TO TALK I MAKE SURE THAT I'M AROUND TO LISTEN 
AND HOW IS JIMMY DOING HE'S O. K. IT'S TAKING A WHILE FOR IT TO SINK IN DID YOU KNOW HIS DAD WELL OR 
YEAH YEAH HE USED TO BRING JIMMY HERE FOR KIDS' FOOTBALL 
JIMMY HOW ARE YOU DOING 
EXCUSE ME HOW'S HE DOING IS HE O. K. 
NOT BAD YEAH YEAH LUKE LUKE 
LUKE IT'S A BAD SIGNAL AREA 
YEAH LUKE COME ON COME ON 
EVEN THOUGH NIGERIA IS A CHRISTIAN AND A MUSLIM COUNTRY 
A BELIEF IN BLACK MAGIC IS STILL ENDEMIC ACROSS BOTH COMMUNITIES 
SO YOU'RE STICKING TO THIS RITUAL BURIAL AFRICAN STYLE 
WELL YES 
I MEAN BECAUSE IT'S A POSSIBILITY AND WE KNOW HE SPENT TIME IN AFRICA 
RIGHT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE AWKWARD SQUAD 
I THINK THAT CAME FROM HIS FATHER'S STORIES 
I MEAN YOU CAN IMAGINE A KID BELIEVING IN IT 
I CAN IMAGINE A KID WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A NINETEEN YEAR OLD 
THE BELIEF THAT HIS DAD MIGHT STILL BE INVOLVED IN UNDERCOVER WORK GIVES JIMMY A PSYCHIC REFUGE 
BUT THERE'S A REALITY NOW WE HAVE PROVED HIS FATHER IS DEAD 
YES BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO LET THE INTERNAL OBJECT GO 
INTERNAL OBJECT THE IMAGE HE'S GOT IN HIS HEAD OF HIS DAD 
AND I THINK THAT BY SEEKING TO GET US TO BELIEVE IN THE AWKWARD SQUAD IT KEEPS HIS FATHER ALIVE 
IN HIS HEAD YES WHICH HAS GOT TO BE A MESS HE'S GOT FRANK BRINGING HIM IN TO SEE THE BODY 
COLERIDGE SAYING NO YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT AND THESE ARE IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN HIS LIFE 
WHY DIDN'T HIS MOTHER BRING HIM IN 
I FOUND FRAGMENTS OF A DARK BLUE PAINT EMBEDDED IN THE FIBRES OF DEARDEN'S SHORTS 
AND COMPARISONS SHOW THAT IT'S CAR PAINT FROM A VAUXHALL OLDER STYLE LIKE AN ASTRA OR A CAVALIER 
THEY DISCONTINUED THIS BLUE COLOUR IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES I'LL CHECK IT OUT O. K. 
YEAH I'LL COME WITH YOU CAN YOU TAKE THAT THANKS 
WHAT IS THAT SMELL 
IT'S DEARDEN'S ADIPOCERE 
I'VE BEEN BOILING IT YOU'RE BOILING A BODY 
ONLY A BIT OF IT 
RIGHT WHEN I EXPOSED THE SKULL I SAW THESE SCRATCHES WHICH YOU 
CAN SEE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MADE BY A BEVELLED EDGED BLADE YOU CAN TELL BY THE V. SHAPED CURVED FLOOR 
SEE WHERE IT SLIPPED 
SO THEY CUT INTO THE SCALP 
POSSIBLY YEAH PRE OR POST MORTEM 
I'D SAY POST MORTEM BECAUSE THE LINE TRAVERSES THE FRACTURE CAUSING THE HAEMORRHAGE 
IS THERE ANY BRAIN TISSUE PRESENT NO WHY 
I'M THINKING OF A NIGERIAN RITUAL KILLING 
THEY WOULD HARVEST BLOOD AND BODY PARTS TO MAKE POTIONS 
THE BRAIN IS THE SOURCE OF INTELLIGENCE SO THEY BELIEVE THAT IF THE SOURCE 
SO YOU EAT IT AND BECOME MORE INTELLIGENT 
LOOK FOR THE LAST TIME I DON'T KNOW HER 
DEARDEN'S LAST VISIT TO LAGOS WAS IN APRIL 
HE WAS DUE BACK ON THE FOURTEENTH BUT HAS A TAXI RECEIPT FROM HEATHROW ON THE SIXTEENTH 
HE CHANGED HIS FLIGHT I CHECKED 
HE FLEW BACK FROM BENIN COURTESY OF THE BRITISH CONSULATE 
O. K. CHECK WITH THE FOREIGN OFFICE 
YUP THESE DON'T LOOK VERY OFFICIAL 
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE IF HE WAS A MERCENARY HE WOULDN'T KEEP RECORDS WOULD HE I KNOW 
THESE TAXI RECEIPTS ARE ALL THE SAME HANDWRITING 
SAME DRIVER 
WE'VE MET THIS PERSON 
YOU USED TO DRIVE TAXIS YEAH 
YEAH IN THE DIM AND DISTANT 
YEAH WELL IT'S THE DIM AND DISTANT I'M CONCERNED WITH 
RIGHT NOW THIS MAN 
YOU LIED TO ME YOU TOLD ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM 
NO YOU USED TO TAKE HIM TO THE AIRPORT EVERY TIME HE WENT TO NIGERIA 
DID I MM 
WHAT TYPE OF CAR DID YOU DRIVE 
OH ER 
I DON'T REMEMBER NO 
WHAT COLOUR WHAT WAS IT 
SORRY 
YOU HAD 
NO TAX NO INSURANCE NO PRIVATE HIRE LICENCE 
WELL IT WAS AN OLD BANGER I WAS BROKE 
STONEY STONEY BROKE 
WHAT KIND OF OLD BANGER 
WAS IT 
A VAUXHALL 
AND DID YOU CARRY DEARDEN'S BODY IN THE BOOT AND BURY HIM IN THE TUNNEL 
I USED TO HAVE FLUFFY DICE IF THAT HELPS 
DID YOU CARRY DEARDEN'S BODY IN THE BOOT AND BURY HIM IN THE TUNNEL 
THE BIG END WENT 
AND IT WASN'T WORTH REPAIRING SO I SOLD IT FOR SCRAP AND I USED THE CASH TO GET INTO MY RECORDS 
WHERE DID YOU SELL IT SOMEWHERE ESSEX 
WHEN I DON'T KNOW 
CHRISTOPHER DEARDEN COULD HAVE HAD ANY TAXI HE WANTED YEAH 
BUT INSTEAD HE 
CHOSE AN OLD BANGER 
JIMMY JIMMY 
JIMMY 
GUESS WHAT DEARDEN ACTUALLY GOT HIMSELF ARRESTED ON HIS LAST TRIP 
TO NIGERIA BUT THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME WHAT FOR NO RECORDS 
NO BUT SOMEONE AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE OVER HERE INTERCEDED ON HIS BEHALF 
MR. FINDLAY DO YOU KNOW A MAN NAMED CHRISTOPHER DEARDEN 
NO SORRY 
HE WORKED FOR A COMPANY CALLED J. TECH 
NO 
YOU AUTHORISED THE PAYMENT TO SECURE 
THE RELEASE OF CHRISTOPHER DEARDEN FROM THE NIGERIAN AUTHORITIES WHICH IS 
STRANGE BECAUSE YOUR AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY AT THE TIME WAS LATIN AMERICA 
MAYBE I WAS FILLING IN FOR SOMEONE WHY WAS HE DETAINED BY THE NIGERIAN AUTHORITIES NO IDEA 
WAS YOUR INTERVENTION SANCTIONED WHAT 
THE PAYMENT YOU MADE WAS IT A BRIBE WAS IT UNDER THE TABLE OR WAS IT KOSHER WHAT 
WE MADE MANY MANY PAYMENTS BOTH OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL OVER MANY YEARS 
SO AWKWARD SQUAD NIGERIAN MILITIA GROUP WAS HE DETAINED BECAUSE OF THAT 
I RECEIVED MANY CALLS BOTH DAY AND NIGHT ABOUT MANY SUBJECTS 
I CAN'T REMEMBER THEM EACH INDIVIDUALLY 
THAT'S WEIRD BECAUSE HE HAD YOUR HOME PHONE NUMBER 
BASTARD 
THE POWDER THAT I EXTRACTED FROM DEARDEN'S LOCKET 
IT HAS A VERY HIGH KERATIN CONTENT 
THAT'S THE STUFF THAT HUMAN HAIR IS MADE OF 
YES BUT IN THIS CASE ELECTROPHORESIS SHOWS IT'S 
RHINO HORN RHINO HORN WHICH IS MADE OF HAIR UNLIKE COWS WHICH HAVE A HIGH CALCIUM CORE 
DOES THAT FIT YOUR AFRICAN THEORY IT DOESN'T COS IT'S CHINESE IT'S A CHINESE THEORY NOW 
IT'S A CURE FOR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION 
WAS HE IMPOTENT IS THAT WHY HE USED IT 
DOES IT WORK THEN THIS RHINO HORN 
OBVIOUSLY NOT IF HIS WIFE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR 
GET IN 
YOU'VE PUT ON WEIGHT 
YEAH I'M IN LOVE SAME OLD BLOOMY 
YEAH YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY WE AGREED NOT TO MEET 
POLICE GOT ME IN SHIT 
DID YOU TELL THEM ANYTHING WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I THINK WE SHOULD AGREE ON A STORY 
WE AGREED ON OUR STORY TEN YEARS AGO SO WHY ARE WE HERE IT'S OUT 
WHAT'S OUT IT IT WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU WHEN DID YOU BECOME SO BLOODY SPINELESS 
LOOK CALM DOWN DIDN'T YOU GET THE LETTER 
YES 
SO 
WE SHOULDN'T BE MEETING 
SO WHAT DO WE DO WE GO HOME WE LIVE OUR LIVES 
THINGS ARE STARTING TO HAPPEN 
OH F. 
THANK YOU 
I TOLD YOU MEETING WAS A MISTAKE 
NO NO COME HERE 
NO NO NO LET HIM GO 
DON'T ANSWER IT 
KEW GARDENS CAME BACK ON THE SAMPLES I FOUND IN THE BAGS AND ON THE BODY 
AND THE SOIL IS FROM A PARTICULAR TYPE OF DECIDUOUS WOODLAND BEECH FOREST 
IT'S ONLY FOUND IN THESE AREAS SHADED RED 
DOES THIS GIVE US A MURDER SCENE 
WELL THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND 
NO BUT I CAN BE MORE SPECIFIC 
THE SEED PODS BELONG TO CEPHALANTHERA RUBRA 
RED HELLEBORINE IT'S AN EXTREMELY RARE ORCHID AND IT ONLY GROWS IN THREE PLACES IN THE COUNTRY 
GLOUCESTERSHIRE HAMPSHIRE AND BUCKS 
DISPOSAL OF THE BODY'S OFTEN THE MOST DANGEROUS 
PART OF THE CRIME FOR A KILLER SO HE MINIMISES HIS RISK BY NOT TRAVELLING TOO FAR WITH THE BODY 
HOWEVER THIS IS NOT A NORMAL DUMP SITE THIS WAS CHOSEN SPECIFICALLY 
THERE'S A RITUAL INVOLVED WITH THE DISPOSAL OF THE BODY IT WAS ARRANGED 
YES AND ALSO BOTH SHOES CONTAINED GRAVE SOIL WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT THEY WERE REMOVED POST MORTEM 
THE BURIAL WAS RITUALISTIC I ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT I DON'T ARGUE WITH THAT 
BUT IF THE MURDER WAS RITUALISTIC IT WOULD'VE HAPPENED IN THE CHAMBER TO CUT DOWN TRAVEL TIME POSSIBLY 
BECAUSE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN THE MURDER WAS UNPLANNED SPONTANEOUS AND COULD'VE HAPPENED ANYWHERE 
IN THESE AREAS SHADED RED YEAH 
YOU DIDN'T ACCOMPANY JIMMY WHEN HE CAME TO SEE THE BODY 
HE DIDN'T ASK 
OH HOW DID YOU FEEL 
I'M USED TO IT 
I THINK JIMMY BLAMES ME FOR HIS DAD'S DISAPPEARANCE 
BUT JIMMY THINKS HIS DAD'S IN AFRICA SO HOW CAN HE BLAME YOU 
SORRY THAT IT WASN'T WHAT I MEANT 
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THAT SORRY ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T BLAME YOURSELF 
DID YOUR HUSBAND KNOW ABOUT YOUR AFFAIR 
HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING 
THAT WAS PAR FOR THE COURSE WITH CHRIS THOUGH WASN'T IT 
I MEAN HE DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT HE WAS ILL 
SO DO YOU THINK HE KNEW 
YES 
MRS. DEARDEN WERE YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND PHYSICALLY INTIMATE 
DO WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS I NEED AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION PLEASE 
THE MORE DISTANT WE BECAME I THINK 
I THINK THE MORE DIFFICULT CHRIS FOUND IT 
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE 
WE FOUND TRACES OF WHAT WE THINK IS AN APHRODISIAC IN HIS LOCKET 
I FOUND THIS CARD 
IT WAS 
IT WAS IN HIS SUIT 
I FOUND IT ABOUT 
A YEAR OR SO AFTER CHRIS DISAPPEARED 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT RIGHT THAT IS IT NOW 
WE'RE GOING HOME YOU CAN'T KEEP DRAGGING US IN HERE 
THIS IS A MURDER INVESTIGATION I CAN DO WHAT I LIKE WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL FIND OUT 
DON'T COME THE ATTITUDE I'VE GOT THE ATTITUDE DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK INSIDE 
FRANK YOU'RE MAKING EVERYTHING WORSE LET'S JUST GO HOME 
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T TOLD YOU LUCY PLEASE NO 
HE PHONED CHRIS 
THE NIGHT THAT HE DISAPPEARED 
HE PHONED AND LEFT A MESSAGE 
LUCY OR JIMMY AFTER THE TONE THANKS FOR CALLING BYE 
JIMMY 
JIMMY ARE YOU THERE 
IT'S ME IT'S DAD 
WHO FOR 
IT WAS FOR JIMMY 
LISTEN SON 
I'VE BEEN IN A BIT OF A MESS 
BUT I'VE REALISED THAT 
I'VE NOT SEEN ENOUGH OF YOU YOU KNOW AND 
WELL THAT'S GONNA CHANGE 
I LOVE YOU I LOVE THE BONES OF YOU SON 
HE WAS RANTING AND RAVING ABOUT HOW HE WAS SORRY AND HOW HE LOVED HIM 
AS IF JUST SAYING THE WORDS ARE GONNA MAKE EVERYTHING O. K. 
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE MESSAGE 
I ERASED IT 
THERE ISN'T A DAY GOES BY WHEN I DON'T REGRET WHAT I'VE DONE 
DOES JIMMY KNOW PLEASE LUCE DOES JIMMY KNOW 
NO HE DOESN'T 
THIS IS A MAN WHO IGNORED HIS SON DURING HIS LIFE I'VE GOT THE CARD 
RIGHT THEN HE CALLS HIS SON SAYING I LOVE YOU JUST BEFORE HE DIES 
WELL MAYBE HE'S GUILTY OR 
MAYBE HE KNOWS HE'LL DIE IT WASN'T SUICIDE RIGHT 
O. K. AND THIS MAN FRANK MONK ERASES THE CALL 
YEP JEALOUSY 
YEAH BUT HE HAS THE MOTIVE TO KILL CHRIS DEARDEN BECAUSE HE HAS THE MOST TO GAIN THE WIFE AND THE SON 
THE BODY WAS FOUND NEAR GROWBAGS AND HE IS A GARDENER SO ALL THINGS POINT TO FRANK MONK ALL RIGHT 
NOW THE CALL WHAT ABOUT IT 
RECORDS WERE ONLY KEPT OF PHONE CALLS MADE BUT I THINK I'VE GOT A SOLUTION 
THE RED AREAS ARE WHERE THAT RARE ORCHID IS FOUND THE SEEDS EVE FOUND 
EXACTLY BUT IF WE COMPARE IT WITH THE LOCATIONS OF U. GRO NURSERIES AND THEN LOOK AT THE NEAREST NURSERY 
TO SHEPTON WITH THAT SAME ALKALINE SOIL COMPOSITION 
WE CAN THEN TRACE ALL CALLS MADE WITHIN A TWENTY MILE RADIUS 
GO ON THEN DO IT 
GIVE ME THE CARD 
DETAILS ARE INSIDE 
SO OUR TURNOVER'S RISEN FROM TEN THOUSAND TO THREE MILLION IN A DECADE 
YOU DIDN'T COME HERE TO TALK ABOUT MY BUSINESS WHAT DO YOU WANT 
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT CHRIS DEARDEN YEAH WHAT ABOUT HIM HE'S DEAD DEAD 
MM HE RECEIVED ONE OF YOUR CARDS IT'S GOT YOUR LOGO ON THE BACK AND I ASSUME IT'S SIGNED BY YOU

TELL ME ABOUT DEARDEN 
THIS WAS A GUY 
WE MET IN A PUB WHICH PUB

SO YOU MEET A GUY IN A PUB AND THEN MAKE A SPECIAL CARD FOR HIM USING HIS NICKNAME DEARDO 
WELL FRIENDS CALL ME HURSTY 
I'M SURE YOUR FRIENDS HAVE GOT A NAME FOR YOU BUT HE WASN'T REALLY A FRIEND WAS HE 
AND THEN YOU SENT HIM A CARD MAKING REFERENCE TO HIS SEXUAL PERFORMANCE 
SOMETIMES PEOPLE FIND IT EASIER TO TALK TO STRANGERS 
O. K. HOW DID YOU KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO SEE HIM AGAIN I MEAN DID YOU EXCHANGE NUMBERS 
NO HE SAID HE WAS A REGULAR SO I TOOK A CHANCE 
OH IN THIS PUB THAT YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE NAME OF

THE HIERARCHY GOES FINDLAY HURST BLOOM RIGHT BLOOM'S THE WEAK LINK 
DIDN'T YOU NOTICE HOW HURST DEFERRED TO HIM O. K. 
GOT UP AND GAVE HIM HIS SEAT 
OUR BODY WAS FOUND FACING THE NORTH YEAH 
THE RITUAL OF THE BURIAL IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE NAVAJO IN THAT THE NAVAJO BELIEVE 
THAT THE WORLD OF THE DEAD IS TOWARDS NORTH 
THE TYING UP THE SWAPPING OF THE SHOES WERE ALL INTENDED 
TO MAKE THE BODY UNSERVICEABLE TO THE EVIL SPIRITS THE CHINDI 
THE CHINDI ARE THE EVIL SPIRITS SO WHAT ABOUT THE CHOPPING OFF OF THE FINGERTIPS 
THEY BELIEVE THAT YOUR FINGERTIPS AND YOUR HAIR IS WHERE THE EVIL SPIRITS ENTER THE BODY OH 
O. K. SO THE PURPOSE OF THE WHOLE BURIAL WAS TO PREVENT THE GHOST FROM ENTERING AND HAUNTING THE LIVING 
I UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF THE NAVAJO RITUAL WHY DID IT HAPPEN TO A WHITE MALE IN ENGLAND 
WELL MAYBE THE KILLER WAS A BELIEVER 
RIGHT THESE GUYS WHAT ARE THEY AN OFFSHOOT TRIBAL CULT THING THAT'S 
IT'S A POSSIBILITY YEAH IT IS 
THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE DISPOSAL 
OF THE BODY TELLS YOU THAT SOMEONE BELIEVES IN EVIL SPIRITS
