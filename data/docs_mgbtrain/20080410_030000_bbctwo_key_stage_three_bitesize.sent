HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE SECOND SCIENCE PROGRAMME IN THE KEY STAGE THREE BITESIZE REVISION SERIES 
IN PROGRAMME ONE WE TACKLED ALL OF THE BIOLOGY AND SOME OF THE CHEMISTRY YOU NEED TO KNOW 
THIS PROGRAMME CONCENTRATES ON MORE CHEMISTRY PLUS THE PHYSICS YOU NEED TO COVER HERE'S WHAT'S COMING UP 
THE PROGRAMME IS DIVIDED UP INTO EIGHT SECTIONS 
AND DESIGNED IN BITESIZE CHUNKS SO YOU CAN DECIDE 
JUST HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO GET THROUGH IN YOUR REVISION TIME 
THE NUMBERS IN THE MENU 
WILL HELP YOU KEEP TRACK OF WHERE YOU ARE IN THE PROGRAMME 
WHEREVER YOU ARE AND WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING IF YOU WATCH THESE PROGRAMMES ALONGSIDE YOUR OWN REVISION 
THEY'RE BOUND TO HELP YOU BOOST YOUR CONFIDENCE BEFORE THOSE IMPORTANT TESTS SO LET'S GET GOING 
IN CHEMISTRY IT'S IMPORTANT TO SORT OUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PHYSICAL CHANGES 
AND CHEMICAL REACTIONS THAT HAPPEN TO MATERIALS LET'S LOOK AT CHEMICAL REACTIONS FIRST 
CHEMICAL REACTIONS OR CHANGES OCCUR WHEN A NEW SUBSTANCE IS FORMED 
STRIKING A MATCH WILL RESULT IN A CHEMICAL REACTION 
THE BURNING RELEASES ENERGY 
ASH AND CARBON DIOXIDE ARE FORMED AND THIS CHANGE IS NOT REVERSIBLE 
BUT OTHER CHANGES WHICH DO NOT INVOLVE A CHEMICAL REACTION ARE CALLED PHYSICAL CHANGES 
SO WHEN ICE MELTS IT IS A PHYSICAL CHANGE 
ICE AND WATER LOOK DIFFERENT BUT THEY'RE STILL THE SAME SUBSTANCE 
IN THE NEXT FEW CLIPS WE'LL SEE DIFFERENT CHANGES 
HERE'S A TYPICAL TEST QUESTION 
NOTICE HOW THE QUESTION ASKS YOU ONLY TO IDENTIFY THE CHANGES 
NOT EXPLAIN WHY YOU'VE CHOSEN THEM 
SO YOU DON'T NEED TO JUSTIFY YOUR CHOICE 
WRITE YOUR ANSWER DOWN AS YOU WATCH THE NEXT CLIP 
O. K. HOW DID YOU GET ON 
YOUR ANSWER SHOULD INDICATE 
LET'S RUN THROUGH THEM AGAIN 
WITH BURNING NEW SUBSTANCES ARE MADE 
AND WE CAN'T REVERSE THE CHANGE SO THIS IS A CHEMICAL REACTION 
HERE WE HAVE A CHANGE OF STATE THAT CAN EASILY BE REVERSED 
SO THIS IS A PHYSICAL CHANGE 
THIS IS ALSO A PHYSICAL CHANGE 
WATER VAPOUR CHANGING BACK INTO WATER 
IN COOKING NEW SUBSTANCES ARE MADE 
AND THE CHANGE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REVERSE 
SO THIS IS A CHEMICAL REACTION 
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE THE KEY POINTS WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES 
THE FIRST TYPE OF PHYSICAL CHANGE WE'LL LOOK AT IS DISSOLVING 
WHERE A SOLID DISSOLVES INTO A LIQUID 
TWO IDENTICAL BEAKERS OF WATER TWO IDENTICAL PILES OF SALT 
SO THE SCALES BALANCE BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF I PUT THIS SALT INTO THE BEAKER 
THAT SALT WILL GO DOWN WON'T IT 
IT'LL BE HEAVIER THERE'LL BE MORE WEIGHT WITH THE SALT IN THE BEAKER 
I BET IT'LL GO DOWN AT FIRST BUT THEN GO UP AGAIN YOU'RE BOTH WRONG 
THIS SIDE WILL GO UP BECAUSE THERE'S TWO THINGS ON THAT SIDE AND THERE'S ONLY ONE THING ON THIS SIDE 
GO ON THEN LET'S SEE 
THEY'RE STILL BALANCED WHY 
LET'S FIND OUT 
STELLA CAN YOU TRY THIS 
O. K. 
THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN I TRIED IT 
THEY STILL BALANCE BECAUSE THE SALT IS STILL THERE 
IT WEIGHS THE SAME WHEN IT'S IN THE WATER AS WHEN IT'S IN THE PILE NEXT TO IT 
BUT SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON HERE 
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT YOUR EXPERIMENT NOW 
LOOK THE SALT'S GONE BUT THE SCALES STILL BALANCE 
SO EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T SEE THE SALT NOW IT IS STILL THERE 
BECAUSE THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED IT LOOKS AS IF IT HAS DISAPPEARED 
BUT IT IS STILL THERE REMEMBER WHEN A PHYSICAL CHANGE TAKES PLACE THE MASS REMAINS CONSTANT 
SO THE SCALES REMAINED BALANCED AND THIS CHANGE CAN BE EASILY REVERSED 
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BIG BREAKFAST 
SO YOU HAVE LOTS OF ENERGY TO MAKE YOU CONCENTRATE 
NOW FOUR S. WORDS THAT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER 
YOU NEED TO KNOW THESE FOR YOUR TEST 
SO WHY NOT WRITE ALL FOUR OF THEM DOWN WITH SOME EXAMPLES 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF DISSOLVING 
CAN YOU REMEMBER THE FOUR S. WORDS AND THEIR DEFINITIONS 
THIS IS A REALLY KEY AREA THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW WELL SO WHY NOT REWIND TO THE KEY POINTS 
ANOTHER PHYSICAL CHANGE IS WHEN MATERIALS EXPAND AND CONTRACT DUE TO A CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE 
BEFORE THE METAL BALL IS HEATED IT EASILY FALLS THROUGH THE RING 
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE HEAT IT FOR A FEW MINUTES 
THE BALL NO LONGER FALLS THROUGH THE RING THE METAL HAS EXPANDED 
LET'S LOOK AT THAT AGAIN AT THE PARTICLE LEVEL 
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS WHEN SOMETHING EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS 
WHEN A SOLID IS HEATED 
THE PARTICLES INSIDE INCREASE THEIR MOVEMENT 
AND THE PARTICLES MOVE SLIGHTLY FURTHER APART 
SO THE WHOLE OBJECT EXPANDS 
THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS IF ENERGY IS REMOVED BY COOLING 
THE PARTICLES DECREASE THEIR MOVEMENT 
MOVE CLOSER TOGETHER AND THE MATERIAL CONTRACTS 
WE'LL NOW TAKE A CLOSER LOOK 
AT CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS 
SOME CHEMICAL REACTIONS HAPPEN IN THE EARTH'S CRUST OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS 
WE CAN SUMMARISE THESE GEOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE ROCK CYCLE 
WE'LL LOOK AT THIS WITH EXAMPLES OF THE THREE TYPES OF ROCK YOU NEED TO KNOW 
VOLCANIC ROCK IS CALLED IGNEOUS ROCK 
IGNEOUS COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD MEANING FIRE 
THAT'S WHERE IT'S COMING FROM MOLTEN ROCK HOTTER THAN FIRE BUT HOW IS IT HOT 
THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH THE CORE IS THOUSANDS OF DEGREES CELSIUS 
IT'S HOT ENOUGH TO MAKE MOLTEN ROCK 
WHICH IS WHAT THE NEXT LAYER THE MANTLE IS MADE OF 
THE EARTH'S CRUST IS ANYTHING FROM FIVE TO SEVENTY FIVE KILOMETRES THICK 
IT'S COOLER AND SO IT'S SOLID 
SOMETIMES THE MOLTEN ROCK POURS OUT THROUGH VOLCANOES 
THIS IS BROWN SUGAR IN WATER 
WHEN HEATED IT BECOMES LIKE TOFFEE 
BUT WHEN YOU POUR IT ON THIS TRAY 
IT COOLS AND SOLIDIFIES LIKE MOLTEN ROCK 
AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH IGNEOUS ROCKS IGNEOUS ROCKS HAVE A CRYSTAL STRUCTURE 
AND THE SIZE OF THE CRYSTALS DEPENDS ON HOW QUICKLY THE ROCK COOLS 
THE QUICKER IT COOLS THE SMALLER THE CRYSTALS 
EXAMPLES OF IGNEOUS ROCK ARE GRANITE AND BASALT 
WHICH HAVE SMALL CRYSTALS THAT COOLED FAST 
AND QUARTZ WHICH HAS LARGE CRYSTALS DUE TO COOLING SLOWLY 
THE NEXT CLIP LOOKS AT SEDIMENTARY ROCKS CREATED VERY DIFFERENTLY 
OVER THE YEARS BITS OF SEDIMENTARY ROCK SETTLE ON THE SEA BED BECAUSE OF GRAVITY 
AND THE LAYER GETS TO BE VERY THICK 
AS IT THICKENS MORE PRESSURE IS EXERTED ON THE BOTTOM OF IT 
AS THE PARTICLES GET SQUASHED THE WATER IS SQUEEZED OUT 
LEAVING DEPOSITS THAT CAUSE CEMENTATION WHERE THE PARTICLES ARE CEMENTED TOGETHER 
THE CEMENTING OF THE SEDIMENT FORMS SEDIMENTARY ROCK 
SO SANDSTONE AND LIMESTONE ARE SEDIMENTARY ROCKS 
THEY ARE LAYERED AND SOMETIMES CONTAIN FOSSILS BUT THIS IS NOT THE END OF THE STORY FOR THESE ROCKS 
AFTER THIS SEDIMENTARY ROCK'S MADE 
THE WEIGHT OF THE LAYERS PUSHES THEM DEEP UNDERGROUND 
WHERE THE EARTH CAN HEAT AND SQUASH THE SEDIMENTARY ROCK FURTHER 
AND WHEN IT DOES THIS THE ROCK CHANGES YET AGAIN AND THIS THIRD TYPE OF ROCK IS CALLED METAMORPHIC 
IT'S THIS HEAT THAT GIVES THIS THIRD TYPE OF ROCK ITS SPECIAL PROPERTIES 
METAMORPHIC ROCKS CAN BE FORMED FROM BOTH SEDIMENTARY AND IGNEOUS ROCKS 
SLATE AND MARBLE ARE METAMORPHIC ROCKS THEY HAVE SMALL CRYSTALS IN LAYERS AND CAN BE USED FOR TILES 
BOTH SEDIMENTARY AND METAMORPHIC ROCKS WORK THEIR WAY TO THE SURFACE 
AND CAN BE ERODED BY THE WEATHER AND MAKE THEIR OWN ROCK CYCLES 
THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT METAMORPHIC ROCK 
CAN GET HEATED AND MELTED DOWN 
READY TO BE THROWN OUT OF THE EARTH AGAIN TO MAKE IGNEOUS ROCKS 
SO THE WHOLE THING STARTS AGAIN THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED A ROCK CYCLE 
THE ROCK CYCLE IS A SERIES OF REPEATING EVENTS 
THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS 
SO IF BRICKS ARE MADE BY BAKING THAT MEANS THEY'RE HEATED 
SO WHICH TYPE OF ROCK IS FORMED BY HEATING 
THE ANSWER IS METAMORPHIC ROCK 
WHERE THE ROCK IS COMPRESSED AND HEATED CHANGING THE WAY IT LOOKS 
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE OF THE ANSWER REWIND THE TAPE AND RUN THROUGH THE ROCK CYCLE AGAIN 
THAT IS THE END OF THIS UNIT 
WE HAVE GONE THROUGH PHYSICAL CHANGES TO MATERIALS 
THE ROCK CYCLE AND THE THREE TYPES OF ROCKS 
IN THIS UNIT WE'RE GOING TO SEE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMICAL REACTION 
SO WE NEED TO GET TO GRIPS WITH THOSE ALL IMPORTANT WORD EQUATIONS 
SO LET'S START BY LOOKING AT EXACTLY WHAT A CHEMICAL REACTION IS 
FIRST OF ALL CHEMICAL REACTIONS ALWAYS PRODUCE A NEW SUBSTANCE 
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY A CHEMICAL CHANGE UNLIKE MOST PHYSICAL CHANGES 
CANNOT BE CHANGED BACK LET'S LOOK AT SOME THAT ARE CLOSE TO HOME 
JUST IN TIME PERFECT 
ANOTHER CHEMICAL REACTION HAS JUST HAPPENED HERE 
CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE USEFUL IN COOKING 
THEY HELP IMPROVE THE TASTE OF FOOD 
COOKING AND CHEMISTRY HAVE QUITE A BIT IN COMMON 
THE STARTING MATERIALS IN A CHEMICAL REACTION ARE CALLED THE REACTANTS 
THESE REACT WITH EACH OTHER 
TO FORM A COMPLETELY NEW SUBSTANCE THE PRODUCT 
AS YOU CAN SEE 
PRODUCTS HAVE VERY DIFFERENT PROPERTIES TO THE REACTANTS 
THIS CAKE IS A LOT FIRMER 
TASTES A LOT NICER THAN THE INDIVIDUAL REACTANTS 
IT'S A DIFFERENT COLOUR TOO 
NOT ALL CHEMICAL REACTIONS NEED HEAT ENERGY TO MAKE THEM HAPPEN 
TAKE SOME BICARBONATE OF SODA ADD A LITTLE VINEGAR AND WATCH 
IT'S ANOTHER CHEMICAL REACTION THIS TIME ONE OF THE PRODUCTS IS A GAS 
ENOUGH TO INFLATE A BALLOON 
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT ANOTHER CHEMICAL REACTION 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD THE METAL IRON IN POWDERED FORM TO YELLOW POWDERED SULPHUR 
THE IRON IS A METAL AND AS WE CAN SEE IS MAGNETIC THE TWO REACTANTS ARE MIXED TOGETHER AND THEN HEATED 
WHEN THE SUBSTANCE COOLS WE HAVE A BLACK SOLID CALLED IRON SULPHIDE 
A NEW SUBSTANCE WHICH WE CALL THE PRODUCT AND IT'S NO LONGER MAGNETIC 
A CHEMICAL REACTION HAS TAKEN PLACE BECAUSE WE STARTED OFF WITH TWO ELEMENTS IRON AND SULPHUR 
AND ENDED UP WITH A COMPOUND IRON SULPHIDE 
WHICH BEHAVES VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM THE ORIGINAL REACTANTS 
TO SUMMARISE THE REACTION OF IRON AND SULPHUR WE CAN ALSO WRITE A WORD EQUATION FOR IT 
THE REACTANTS ARE IRON AND SULPHUR 
THEY'RE PUT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE EQUATION 
AND THE PRODUCT APPEARS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE EQUATION 
SO IRON PLUS SULPHUR MAKES IRON SULPHIDE 
YOU REALLY NEED TO GET TO GRIPS WITH WORD EQUATIONS TO ANSWER CHEMISTRY QUESTIONS IN THE TEST 
SO THERE ARE PLENTY MORE IN OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS UNIT 
SO FAR WE'VE LOOKED AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CHEMICAL REACTIONS 
BUT NOT ALL REACTIONS ARE USEFUL FOR INSTANCE WHEN METAL RUSTS THE REASON IS A CHEMICAL REACTION 
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING INVESTIGATION I'M MEETING ALEX ABOARD HER SHIP 
TO FIND OUT ABOUT A VERY UNUSUAL EXAMPLE OF A FAMILIAR PROBLEM RUST 
YOU HAVE TO WEAR THIS HAT I'M AFRAID THANK YOU SO I HEAR YOU HAVE A BIT OF A RUSTY PROBLEM 
WE DO INDEED SO WHERE IS IT 
DOWN HERE THE WORLD'S FIRST ENGINE POWERED SUBMARINE THE RESURGAM WHICH SANK BACK IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY 
WHAT CONDITION IS IT IN WE DON'T KNOW IT'S MADE OF IRON AND IRON RUSTS ESPECIALLY IN THE SEA 
WE'RE SURVEYING IT TO FIND OUT ITS CONDITION 
RUST IS THE PRODUCT OF A CHEMICAL REACTION THE IRON REACTS WITH THE OXYGEN IN THE AIR OR IN SEA WATER 
IT'S A FORM OF OXIDATION IT ALSO NEEDS MOISTURE AND THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF THAT ON A SHIP 
AND IT LEADS TO CORROSION LIKE THIS 
I DON'T HAVE TO GET WET TO SEE THE RESURGAM THE CAMERA ON THE FRONT OF THE REMOTELY CONTROLLED EXPLORER 
ALLOWS US TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT'S DOWN THERE 
LOOK IT HASN'T RUSTED AWAY IT'S GOT BIGGER BACK ON DECK 
LOOK AT THIS WHAT IS THAT 
THIS IS FROM ANOTHER SHIPWRECK MOSTLY RUST BUILT UP OVER HUNDREDS OF YEARS ON THE SEA BED 
I'LL NEED TO GET MY DELICATE TOOLS 
THERE YOU GO CAN YOU SEE THE OBJECT IN THERE 
CAN YOU SEE THAT'S AN IRON SHAFT AND IT FEELS HARD 
AND THAT'S THE RUST ROUND THERE YES AMAZING CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT'S ON OUR SUB DOWN BELOW 
CAN WE TAKE A LOOK YES LET'S DIVE 
I WANT TO BRING SOMETHING UP FROM THE RESURGAM SO WE CAN SEE ITS CONDITION 
GO FORWARDS FORWARDS SEE THAT BIT THAT'S ROUND 
CAN YOU SEE EXCELLENT WE'LL GET DIVERS TO GO DOWN AND PICK IT UP LET'S GO 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I FOUND 
THIS HAS BEEN LYING ON THE SEA FLOOR FOR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED TEN YEARS YES THAT'S RIGHT 
IT'S A PORTHOLE FANTASTIC IT'S IN REALLY GOOD CONDITION 
YOU CAN STILL SEE THE GLASS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT 
FOR RUSTING TO OCCUR WE CAN SEE THAT TWO THINGS ARE NECESSARY OXYGEN AND WATER 
WE CAN SEE THAT IRON REACTS WITH OXYGEN TO PRODUCE IRON OXIDE 
THEN THE IRON OXIDE REACTS WITH WATER 
TO PRODUCE HYDRATED IRON OXIDE 
SO RUSTING IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN UNHELPFUL CHEMICAL REACTION 
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF AN UNHELPFUL CHEMICAL REACTION 
IS THE EFFECT OF BURNING FOSSIL FUELS 
WE'VE SEEN THAT BURNING FOSSIL FUELS PRODUCES HEAT WHICH WE CAN HARNESS FOR ENERGY 
THE CHEMICAL REACTION ALSO PRODUCES A WASTE PRODUCT CARBON DIOXIDE 
BURNING FOSSIL FUELS IN HUGE QUANTITIES CAN HAVE 
AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT 
AS IT INCREASES THE CONCENTRATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE 
BURNING FOSSIL FUELS FOR ENERGY 
ALSO PRODUCES POLLUTANTS SUCH AS SULPHUR DIOXIDE 
THAT REACT WITH WATER IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND FALLS AS ACID RAIN 
THAT'S THE END OF THIS UNIT 
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT ANY OF THE TYPES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS 
WHY NOT REWIND AND FOCUS ON THOSE WORD EQUATIONS 
THIS UNIT IS SPLIT INTO TWO MAIN SECTIONS 
THE FIRST LOOKS AT METALS THE SECOND AT ACIDS AND ALKALIS 
LET'S LOOK AT THE FIRST SECTION 
STARTING WITH THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN METALS AND NON METALS 
ALL ELEMENTS CAN BE DIVIDED UP INTO TWO GROUPS METALS AND NON METALS 
AND EACH OF THESE GROUPS HAVE SIMILAR PROPERTIES 
THIS GROUP IS METALS WE CAN SEE THEY ARE SOLID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE EXCEPT MERCURY WHICH IS A LIQUID 
THEY'RE GOOD CONDUCTORS OF HEAT AND ELECTRICITY 
AND SOME SUCH AS IRON ARE MAGNETIC 
NON METALS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE A VERY DIVERSE GROUP OF ELEMENTS 
HALF ARE GASES AT ROOM TEMPERATURE FOR EXAMPLE CHLORINE AND OXYGEN GASES 
OTHER NON METALS ARE CARBON AND SULPHUR WHICH ARE SOLIDS 
AND BROMINE WHICH IS A LIQUID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE 
FOR YOUR TEST YOU NEED TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN METALS AND NON METALS 
BUT BE WARNED DON'T JUST RELY ON PHYSICAL PROPERTIES ALONE 
TO SORT OUT METALS FROM NON METALS 
GRAPHITE IS A FORM OF CARBON ANOTHER NON METAL BUT IT'S A GOOD CONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY 
MERCURY ALTHOUGH A METAL IS ALWAYS A LIQUID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE 
WE'LL EXAMINE THE PROPERTIES OF METALS LATER 
THIS SECTION LOOKS AT THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF METALS 
THEIR CHEMICAL PROPERTIES ARE COVERED IN THE NEXT SECTION 
METALS MAY LOOK AND FEEL SIMILAR 
BUT TO FIND OUT WHAT JOB METALS ARE GOOD FOR WE NEED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THEIR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES 
PEOPLE HAVE UNDERSTOOD SOME OF THE PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS FOR A LONG TIME 
THE EGYPTIANS KNEW THAT GOLD DOESN'T REACT WITH AIR AND CORRODE 
IT'S A PROPERTY CALLED BEING INERT INERT MEANS THAT GOLD DOESN'T REACT EASILY WITH OTHER MATERIAL 
THESE UNREACTIVE METALS ARE STILL USED IN JEWELLERY TODAY BECAUSE THEY STAY SHINY FOR YEARS 
IT'S THE COMBINATION OF PROPERTIES IN METALS THAT MAKES THEM USEFUL FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES 
SOME CUTLERY IS COATED WITH SILVER NOT ONLY SO IT LOOKS GOOD BUT SO IT'S SAFE TO PUT IN YOUR MOUTH 
FLEXIBILITY IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT PROPERTY AS METALS CAN BE MOULDED YET STILL KEEP THEIR STRENGTH 
FOR INSTANCE ALUMINIUM IS USED FOR CANS BUT THERE ARE OTHER IMPORTANT PROPERTIES THAT YOU CAN'T SEE 
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS CONDUCTIVITY 
COPPER IS A BRILLIANT CONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY BUT IT'S NOT JUST COPPER THAT HAS HIDDEN PROPERTIES 
IT'S MORE THAN JUST ONE PROPERTY OF A MATERIAL THAT'S OF INTEREST IT'S A WHOLE RANGE OF PROPERTIES 
SO FOR GOLD WELL GOLD IS DUCTILE SO EASY TO WORK WITH 
IT DOESN'T CORRODE AND WE CAN WORK WITH IT AT MINISCULE LEVELS 
IT'S A GOOD CONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY 
IT'S THIS COMBINATION OF PROPERTIES THAT MEANS WE USE GOLD IN ALMOST EVERY ELECTRICAL APPLIANCE 
GOLD IS AT THE VERY HEART OF THE ELECTRONIC AGE 
WE'VE LOOKED AT THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF METALS WE'LL NOW LOOK AT THEIR CHEMICAL PROPERTIES 
WE CAN ALSO STUDY METALS BY LOOKING AT THEIR CHEMICAL PROPERTIES 
SOME METALS COMBINE WITH OTHER ELEMENTS TO FORM NEW COMPOUNDS WHILE OTHERS WILL NOT REACT AT ALL 
WE CAN PLACE METALS IN ORDER OF HOW VIGOROUSLY THEY REACT 
THIS ORDER IS CALLED THE REACTIVITY SERIES 
WE'LL LOOK AT SOME AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE BURN THEM IN AIR 
THEN WHEN WE PUT THEM IN WATER AND THEN FINALLY IN DILUTE ACID 
LET'S START WITH BURNING IN AIR AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE METALS MAGNESIUM IRON AND COPPER 
FIRST OF ALL MAGNESIUM 
AS WE CAN SEE MAGNESIUM BURNS VERY BRIGHTLY IN AIR 
IT READILY COMBINES WITH OXYGEN TO FORM THE COMPOUND MAGNESIUM OXIDE 
THE IRON IN THE FORM OF IRON WOOL BURNS LESS BRIGHTLY 
AND WITH THE COPPER THERE IS NO REACTION AT ALL 
WE CAN WRITE WORD EQUATIONS FOR THEM 
SO WITH BURNING MAGNESIUM IS THE MOST REACTIVE 
THEN COMES IRON AND FINALLY THE LEAST REACTIVE METAL IS COPPER 
METALS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST ARE THE MOST REACTIVE AND THE METALS AT THE BOTTOM THE LEAST REACTIVE 
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER SET OF REACTIONS THIS TIME THE ELEMENTS POTASSIUM MAGNESIUM AND LEAD 
AND SEE HOW THEY REACT WITH WATER 
THE METAL POTASSIUM IS SO REACTIVE IT HAS TO BE KEPT UNDER OIL 
AND HANDLED VERY CAREFULLY 
THE REACTION WITH WATER IS VERY VIGOROUS PRODUCING HYDROGEN GAS 
AND A LOT OF HEAT AND LIGHT 
LET'S NOW TRY MAGNESIUM THE REACTION IS FAR LESS DRAMATIC 
THE BUBBLES ALONG THE METAL STRIP ARE BUBBLES OF HYDROGEN GAS SO THIS METAL IS ALSO REACTING WITH WATER 
AND FINALLY LEAD WHERE THERE IS NO REACTION WITH COLD WATER AT ALL 
THE GENERAL WORD EQUATION FOR A METAL REACTING WITH WATER IS 
WHY NOT TRY AND WRITE OUT THE WORD EQUATION FOR MAGNESIUM AS THIS IS GOOD PRACTICE FOR TEST QUESTIONS 
SO IF WE GO BACK TO OUR REACTIVITY SERIES WE CAN PUT POTASSIUM NEAR THE TOP ABOVE MAGNESIUM 
AND LEAD APPEARS NEAR THE BOTTOM 
NOW THE METALS ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME PLACE IN THIS ORDER 
SO WE CAN MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT METALS WILL REACT 
SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE ADD THEM TO DILUTE ACID WELL WE CAN'T USE POTASSIUM OR SODIUM AT THE TOP 
AS THE REACTIONS WOULD BE EXPLOSIVE 
SO LET'S TRY MAGNESIUM WHICH IS BELOW POTASSIUM THEN ZINC AND THEN COPPER 
AND COPPER SHOULD HAVE THE SLOWEST REACTION 
DILUTE HYDROCHLORIC ACID IS ADDED TO THE METAL MAGNESIUM 
AND STRAIGHT AWAY THE REACTION FIZZES LETTING OFF BUBBLES OF HYDROGEN GAS 
WHICH CAN BE TESTED USING A LIGHTED SPLINT 
NOW LET'S TRY ZINC O. K. 
POWDERED ZINC IS USED AND AGAIN WITH DILUTE HYDROCHLORIC ACID 
THE REACTION IS FAR LESS VIGOROUS BUT HYDROGEN GAS CAN STILL BE TESTED FOR 
LET'S DO THE COPPER NOW 
SHAVINGS OF COPPER ARE USED AND THIS TIME WHEN THE ACID IS ADDED THERE IS NO REACTION 
SO THE ORDER GOING FROM THE MOST REACTIVE IS MAGNESIUM 
THEN ZINC AND FINALLY COPPER 
AND WE CAN ALSO WRITE WORD EQUATIONS FOR THESE REACTIONS 
WHEN METALS REACT WITH ACIDS A PATTERN FOLLOWS 
A COLA DRINK VINEGAR APPLES AND LEMONS 
ALL THESE SUBSTANCES TASTE SHARP 
THIS LEMON CONTAINS AN ACID AND ACIDS ALWAYS HAVE A SOUR TASTE 
THE OPPOSITE OF ACID IS ALKALI 
SOAPS AND WASHING POWDER CONTAIN ALKALIS BUT HOW DO YOU TELL WHICH IS WHICH WITHOUT POISONING YOURSELF 
WHY DOES IT MATTER IF A SOAP OR TOOTHPASTE IS AN ACID OR ALKALI 
YOUR BODY IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT CHEMICALS ACIDIC AND ALKALINE 
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THE PRODUCTS DON'T REACT IN THE WRONG WAY WITH THOSE CHEMICALS 
BUT HOW CAN YOU TELL IF SOMETHING IS EITHER AN ACID OR ALKALI 
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING CALLED UNIVERSAL INDICATOR PAPER IN THESE PACKS HERE 
THIS CHANGES COLOUR DEPENDING ON HOW ACID OR HOW ALKALINE WHATEVER IT IS IS 
WE'VE GOT SOME ORDINARY COLA HERE AND IF I DIP THIS IN WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE 
THAT'S GONE QUITE PINKISH HERE I'VE GOT A TABLE THAT SHOWS THE RANGE THAT YOU CAN GO THROUGH 
AND THEY GO FROM RED WHICH IS ACID THROUGH TO THE BLUE THAT MUST BE AN ACID YES 
SO AN ACID WILL TURN TOWARDS THE ORANGE OR THE RED COLOUR 
AND HERE I'VE GOT SOME ORDINARY HOUSEHOLD BLEACH AND IF WE TEST THIS AGAIN WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE WOW 
THAT'S VERY BLUE GREENISH SO THAT'S AN ALKALI AN ALKALI RIGHT 
WATER IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A NEUTRAL LIQUID WHEN TESTED WITH THE INDICATOR IT HAS A GREEN COLOUR 
ACIDS TAKE PART IN SOME IMPORTANT CHEMICAL REACTIONS WE SAW EARLIER THE REACTIONS OF ACIDS AND METALS 
THESE REACTIONS CAN BE SUMMARISED IN THE WORD EQUATION 
YOU ALSO NEED TO BE FAMILIAR WITH HOW ACIDS REACT WITH BASES 
AND WITH METAL CARBONATES 
DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID IS ADDED TO THE METAL BASE COPPER OXIDE 
WHICH PRODUCES WATER AND A DISSOLVED SALT 
THE WATER CAN BE EVAPORATED AWAY TO LEAVE BLUE CRYSTALS OF THE SALT COPPER SULPHATE 
THE THIRD PATTERN YOU NEED TO LEARN ABOUT ACIDS IS THEIR REACTIONS WITH CARBONATES 
THIS TIME HYDROCHLORIC ACID IS MIXED WITH SODIUM CARBONATE 
THE FIZZING IS DUE TO THE GAS CARBON DIOXIDE BEING RELEASED 
SO THE WORD EQUATION IS 
REACTIONS OF ACIDS WITH ALKALIS ARE NEUTRALISATION REACTIONS 
NEUTRALISATION OCCURS WHEN THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ACID AND ALKALI REACT TO CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT 
FORMING A SALT AND WATER 
IF AN ACID REACTS WITH AN ALKALI A NUMBER OF THINGS CAN HAPPEN 
DEPENDING ON THE TWO YOU'RE MIXING TOGETHER 
ONE USEFUL ONE IS WHEN YOU MIX THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ACID 
WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ALKALI 
THE ACID AND THE ALKALI NEUTRALISE EACH OTHER 
NEUTRALISE THAT MUST BE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE STING 
SO IF A WASP'S STING NEEDS VINEGAR WHICH IS ACIDIC TO NEUTRALISE IT 
IT MUST MEAN THAT THE STING ITSELF IS SLIGHTLY ALKALINE 
SO A BEE STING MUST BE ACIDIC AS IT NEEDS THE ALKALINE BICARBONATE OF SODA TO NEUTRALISE IT 
IT SAYS HERE THAT BICARBONATE OF SODA IS ALSO TAKEN FOR INDIGESTION 
THAT'S BECAUSE IT HELPS BREAK DOWN THE FOOD IN THE STOMACH 
OR SOMEHOW IT MAKES ALL THE WINDY GAS COME OUT MAYBE IT HELPS AS THERE'S SOME KIND OF CHEMICAL REACTION 
SO WE'VE GOT ACID IN OUR STOMACH 
NO WE DON'T STELLA WHAT IS IN OUR STOMACH 
I CAN SHOW YOU 
THIS IS A MODEL OF THE STOMACH 
INSIDE THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT CHEMICALS 
INCLUDING HYDROCHLORIC ACID WHICH IS A VERY STRONG ACID WITH A P. H. OF TWO 
AND THAT ACID IS THERE TO AID DIGESTION AND AS THE ACID BUILDS UP YOU CAN START TO FEEL WINDY 
YOU KNOW THE FEELING SO TO CALM THE STOMACH 
YOU HAVE TO NEUTRALISE THE ACID BY ADDING AN ALKALINE SUBSTANCE 
NOW THESE INDIGESTION TABLETS CONTAIN BICARBONATE OF SODA 
WHICH IS THE SAME SORT OF ALKALINE YOU CAN USE ON BEE STINGS 
SO WHEN THE ACID AND ALKALINE REACT 
YOU GET A SALT PLUS WATER 
NOW THE SALT IS HARMLESS AND THE WATER IS NEUTRAL SO IT CALMS YOUR STOMACH 
SO THE WORD EQUATION YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR NEUTRALISATION REACTIONS IS 
AND WITH THE UNIVERSAL INDICATOR 
WHEN THE RIGHT AMOUNTS OF ACID AND ALKALI ARE ADDED 
THE SOLUTION WILL TURN GREEN NEUTRAL 
SO YOU SHOULD MEMORISE THE PATTERN OF THE REACTIONS OF ACIDS 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THE CHEMISTRY UNITS IN THIS PROGRAMME 
REMEMBER THERE ARE MORE IN THE FIRST SCIENCE PROGRAMME IN THE BITESIZE SERIES 
NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE PHYSICS UNIT 
MY TOP TIP IS TO REMEMBER KEY WORDS 
WE ARE NOW MOVING ON TO THE PHYSICS SECTIONS OF SCIENCE 
WHICH ARE SPLIT INTO SEVERAL SUBJECT AREAS WE'LL KICK OFF WITH ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM 
YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT MAKE UP CIRCUITS 
FIRST OF ALL THE WIRE WHICH WE'VE SEEN AS A METAL 
AND A GOOD CONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY 
NEXT THE BATTERY NOW THE BATTERY IS THE STORE OF ENERGY 
WHICH PROVIDES THE PUSH THAT GETS THE CURRENT FLOWING 
LET'S LOOK MORE CLOSELY 
THE CURRENT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES OF A COMPLETE CIRCUIT 
AND LIGHTS UP THE BULB 
THE BULB USES ELECTRICAL ENERGY BUT NOT CURRENT LOOK 
THE CURRENT IS EXACTLY THE SAME BEFORE 
AND AFTER THE BULB 
YOU MIGHT THINK OF BULBS AS USING CURRENT BUT THEY DON'T 
SOMETIMES MODELS CAN HELP EXPLAIN CERTAIN ASPECTS 
HERE THE FLOW OF NEGATIVE CHARGES IN THE WATER REPRESENT THE CURRENT 
THE WATERWHEEL LIKE THE BULB USES ENERGY AS IT TURNS 
BUT THE CURRENT BEFORE AND AFTER THE WATERWHEEL IS ALWAYS THE SAME 
EVENTUALLY THE WHEEL USES ALL THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY AND THE CURRENT STOPS FLOWING 
BUT NONE OF THE CHARGES ARE USED UP BY THE WHEEL 
IN THE SAME WAY IN THE ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT 
THE CURRENT AFTER THE BULB IS ALWAYS THE SAME AS THE CURRENT BEFORE 
EVENTUALLY THE STORE OF ENERGY IN THE BATTERIES RUNS OUT 
OTHER COMPONENTS OF CIRCUITS THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ARE LIGHT BULBS AND SWITCHES 
LET'S RUN THROUGH HOW THEY'RE SYMBOLISED ON A CIRCUIT DIAGRAM 
A CELL WILL LOOK LIKE THIS AND IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE CELL THIS IS CALLED A BATTERY 
THE BATTERY SUPPLIES THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY 
THE LIGHT BULB WILL HAVE THIS SYMBOL AND SOMETIMES THIS ONE 
AND THE SWITCH WILL EITHER BE OPENED OR CLOSED 
SHOWING WHETHER THE CIRCUIT IS ON OR OFF 
AND IF WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE LIGHT BULB WE NEED A LARGER VOLTAGE TO MAKE THE BULBS LIGHT AS BRIGHTLY 
THAT'S BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULBS CREATE A RESISTANCE IN THE CIRCUIT 
AND THE MORE LIGHT BULBS THERE ARE THE BIGGER THE VOLTAGE NEEDED 
BUT THE LIGHT BULBS DO NOT USE UP THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT JUST THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY 
THE CURRENT GOING INTO THE BULBS IS THE SAME AS THE CURRENT COMING OUT 
THE LIGHT BULBS HERE ARE IN SERIES BUT CAN BE CONNECTED UP ANOTHER WAY 
MORE THAN ONE BULB CAN BE CONNECTED INTO A CIRCUIT LIKE THIS 
THE BULBS ARE SAID TO BE CONNECTED IN SERIES WHEN THE SWITCH BREAKS THE CIRCUIT ALL THE BULBS GO OFF 
THIS IS TRUE WHEREVER THE SWITCH IS POSITIONED IN THE CIRCUIT 
THIS ISN'T THE ONLY WAY TO CONNECT THE BULBS 
THE BULBS ARE NOW CONNECTED IN PARALLE L. 
IF THEY WERE CONNECTED THIS WAY WITH THE SWITCH POSITIONED HERE OR HERE 
THEY STILL ALL GO OFF 
BUT IF THE SWITCH IS PUT IN HERE THEN ONLY ONE GOES OFF 
AND THE SAME HERE 
AND HERE 
WITH THREE SWITCHES IN PLACE AND THE BULBS COVERED WITH COLOURED FILTERS 
WE HAVE A BASIC TRAFFIC LIGHT 
IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THERE IS ONLY ONE CURRENT PACK 
BETWEEN THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE TERMINALS OF THE POWER SUPPLY 
A SWITCH PLACED ANYWHERE IN THE CIRCUIT WILL TURN ALL THE COMPONENTS IN THE CIRCUIT ON AND OFF 
AND THE SIZE OF THE CURRENT IS THE SAME AT ALL POINTS IN THE CIRCUIT 
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF BATTERIES IN THE CIRCUIT 
WILL INCREASE THE CURRENT 
BUT ADDING MORE COMPONENTS WILL REDUCE THE CURRENT 
BECAUSE THERE IS MORE RESISTANCE IN THE CIRCUIT 
IN PARALLEL CIRCUITS THERE IS MORE THAN ONE PATH THE CURRENT CAN TAKE 
BETWEEN THE TERMINALS OF THE POWER SUPPLY 
AND A SWITCH IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT WILL ONLY AFFECT THOSE COMPONENTS IN THE SAME CURRENT PATH 
THE CURRENT SPLITS AND REJOINS AT THE CIRCUIT JUNCTIONS 
THE CURRENT WILL NOT BE THE SAME IN ALL PARTS OF THE CIRCUIT 
BUT THE TOTAL OF THE CURRENT IN THE CIRCUIT IS THE SAME AS THAT LEAVING AND RETURNING TO THE POWER SUPPLY 
HERE IS A DIAGRAM OF A PARALLEL CIRCUIT WITH TWO CURRENT PATHS 
ONE PATH HAS TWO BULBS IN IT AND THE OTHER PATH HAS ONE BULB IN IT 
THE MOST COMMON MAGNETIC MATERIALS ARE IRON STEEL AND NICKEL 
AND WHEN ONE OF THESE METALS IS MAGNETISED WE CALL IT A MAGNET 
THE ENDS OF THE MAGNET ARE CALLED POLES ONE END IS THE NORTH AND THE OTHER IS THE SOUTH 
THEY BOTH ATTRACT THESE PAPER CLIPS 
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF I HAVE ANOTHER MAGNET AND I PUT SIMILAR POLES TOGETHER 
THESE SIX MAGNETS ARE SUSPENDED 
MOVE THEM CLOSER TOGETHER 
WHY 
THE ENDS OF THE MAGNETS ARE CALLED POLES ONE THE NORTH POLE THE OTHER THE SOUTH POLE 
BRING TWO LIKE POLES TOGETHER 
BOTH SOUTH BOTH NORTH 
AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE PUSHES THEM APART 
THEY REPEL BUT BRING TWO DIFFERENT POLES TOGETHER ONE NORTH ONE SOUTH 
AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE PULLS THEM TOGETHER THEY ATTRACT 
NOW IF I PUT THIS METAL SHEET BETWEEN THEM 
THIS COULD BE YOUR FRIDGE DOOR 
THESE MAGNETS PUSH EACH OTHER APART SO THEY HAVE THE SAME POLE ON EACH 
YES EITHER BOTH NORTH OR BOTH SOUTH BUT WHEN YOU BRING THEM NEAR THE METAL DOOR OF THE FRIDGE 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH POLE IS FACING THE DOOR BOTH ARE ATTRACTED 
LET'S MOVE ON TO LOOK AT MAGNETIC FIELDS 
A MAGNET DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TOUCHING WHATEVER IT'S ATTRACTING 
THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET CAN BE SENSED ALL AROUND THE MAGNET AND THIS BASE OF ATTRACTION IS THE MAGNETIC FIELD 
NOW THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS INVISIBLE TO OUR EYES SO HOW DO WE SEE IT 
WELL THESE SMALL PIECES OF IRON ARE CALLED IRON FILINGS AND THEY LINE UP IN THE SHAPE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD 
AND WHERE THE LINES ARE CLOSEST IT'S WHERE THE FORCE IS STRONGEST 
THE ENDS OF THE MAGNET AT THE POLES 
THIS IS ONLY PART OF THE PICTURE 
MAGNETIC FORCE DOESN'T JUST WORK IN AIR THE IRON FILINGS HAVE BEEN MIXED WITH OIL 
AND DROP IN THE MAGNET 
WE CAN SEE THE SHAPE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD ALL AROUND THE MAGNET 
THE IRON FILINGS ARE CLOSEST TOGETHER AT THE POLES AND THAT'S WHERE THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS STRONGEST 
FURTHER AWAY FROM THE MAGNET THE FILINGS ARE WIDER APART 
AND THAT SHOWS THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE DECREASES THE FURTHER AWAY YOU ARE FROM A MAGNET 
HERE ARE THE KEY POINTS THAT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER 
BAR MAGNETS ARE NOT THE ONLY THINGS THAT CAN PRODUCE A MAGNETIC FIELD WATCH WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS CLIP 
WHAT IS CAUSING THIS 
WELL IT'S A COIL OF WIRE ATTACHED TO A BATTERY 
BUT IS IT THE WIRE THAT'S CAUSING THE MAGNETIC FIELD 
WITH THE BATTERY CONNECTED 
WE CAN SEE THE MAGNETIC FIELD 
BUT IF I DISCONNECT THE BATTERY THE MAGNETIC FIELD DISAPPEARS 
SO IT MUST BE THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT THAT'S CAUSING THE MAGNETIC FIELD NOT THE WIRE 
THIS SECTION COMPLETES OUR UNIT ON ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM 
HERE ARE A FEW MORE TIPS ON ANSWERING TEST QUESTIONS 
IF A QUESTION COMES UP IN THE EXAM THAT YOU'RE NOT SURE OF 
COME BACK TO IT AT THE END RATHER THAN WASTING TIME 
IF YOU'RE UNSURE OF ANY OF THE TOPICS WHY NOT GO THROUGH THE KEY POINTS AGAIN 
BUT IF YOU NEED A BREAK TAKE ONE 
IN PHYSICS IT'S OFTEN IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT HOW FAST SOMETHING IS TRAVELLING 
TO DO THAT WE NEED TO TAKE TWO MEASUREMENTS WE NEED TO KNOW THE DISTANCE AN OBJECT HAS TRAVELLED 
AND THE TIME IT HAS TAKEN TO GO FROM A TO B. SO WE CAN FIND OUT HOW FAST IT IS TRAVELLING 
FINDING OUT OUR SPEED WHEN WE TRAVEL IS IMPORTANT TO ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE 
I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT EXACTLY WHAT SPEED IS 
NOW OUR SPEED TELLS US THE DISTANCE WE'VE TRAVELLED IN A CERTAIN TIME 
AND THE FASTER THE SPEED THE MORE GROUND WE COVER EACH SECOND 
SO TO WORK OUT OUR SPEED WE NEED TO KNOW THE DISTANCE WE'VE TRAVELLED AND THE TIME TAKEN TO COVER IT 
I WANT TO FIND OUT HOW THE POLICE KNOW SOMEONE'S SPEEDING AFTER ALL THEY CAN'T WATCH THEIR SPEEDOMETER 
SO HOW DO THEY WORK THE SPEED OUT FOR THIS INVESTIGATION I'M OFF TO SEE TOM MATHESON 
WHO'S VERY INTERESTED IN THE SPEED OF CARS AND LORRIES PARTICULARLY IF THEY'RE BREAKING THE LIMIT 
SO WHY IS IT YOU'RE SO INTERESTED IN THE SPEEDS THAT CARS TRAVEL 
THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS THE SAFETY OF ROAD USERS BE THEY CAR DRIVERS OR PEDESTRIANS 
THE FASTER A VEHICLE IS GOING THE MORE INJURY IT CAN CAUSE TO A PEDESTRIAN 
DO YOU JUST GUESS THAT A CAR IS SPEEDING 
NO WE DON'T GUESS I HAVE SEVERAL METHODS OPEN TO ME 
I HAVE A SPEED GUN 
I HAVE FIXED CAMERAS AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND WE HAVE A TIME AND DISTANCE COMPUTER 
TO CALCULATE A CAR'S SPEED TOM NEEDS TWO MEASUREMENTS 
A DISTANCE THE CAR HAS TRAVELLED AND THE TIME IT TOOK 
TOM CAN USE THE COMPUTER TO MEASURE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MARKINGS ON THE ROAD AND MARKINGS UNDER THE BRIDGE 
AND THEN ALL HE HAS TO DO IS TIME HOW LONG IT TAKES A CAR TO TRAVEL BETWEEN THE TWO MARKS 
AND DIVIDING THE DISTANCE BY THE TIME GIVES HIM THE CAR'S SPEED 
WE'RE GOING TO MEASURE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PAINT MARKS ON THE ROAD AND THE SHADOW OF THE BRIDGE O. K. 
SO IF YOU START THE ORANGE BUTTON WHEN WE COME TO THE MARKS AND TURN IT OFF WHEN WE COME TO THE BRIDGE 
SO THIS COMPUTER'S A BIT LIKE A MEASURING ROLLER THAT'S RIGHT HERE WE ARE START IT NOW STARTED 
AND AS SOON AS I TELL YOU TURN IT OFF 
O. K. 
AND THAT DISTANCE IS ONE HUNDRED FIVE 
THE POLICE HAVE FOUND THAT THIS SORT OF DISTANCE A TENTH OF A MILE 
IS LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE THEM AN ACCURATE INDICATION OF THE CAR'S AVERAGE SPEED 
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS WAIT FOR A LIKELY CANDIDATE 
WE PUT IN ONE HUNDRED FIVE WHICH IS THE DISTANCE MEASUREMENT AND NOW ON THIS SIDE WE'LL USE THE STOPWATCH SIDE OF IT 
WE'LL TIME THE VEHICLES TRAVELLING BETWEEN THE MARKS AND THE BRIDGE 
THAT CAR ON THE OUTSIDE LANE I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING THAT FAST LET'S SEE THE SHADOW THAT'S IT 
NOW TO GET THE SPEED ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS DIVIDE THE DISTANCE 
BY THE TIME THE CAR TAKES TO COVER IT 
FORTY NINE FORTY NINE POINT NINE THREE OH YOU WERE LUCKY 
JUST WITHIN THE LIMIT BY OH SEVEN OF A MILE AN HOUR 
YOU NEED TO USE THE DISTANCE TRAVELLED OVER TIME CALCULATION 
TO CALCULATE THE SPEED WE NEED THE ABOVE FORMULA 
THIS SECTION WILL LOOK AT BALANCED AND UNBALANCED FORCES FIRST LET'S LOOK AT BALANCED FORCES 
SEE THESE BOOKS ON THE TABLE 
THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY'RE DOING MUCH BUT THE WEIGHT OF THE BOOKS IS PUSHING DOWN ON THE TABLE 
AND THAT'S NOT ALL THE TABLE'S ALSO PUSHING BACK ON THE BOOKS 
IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IT DIDN'T 
EVEN THESE COMFY CUSHIONS CAN PUSH BACK ON ME 
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS AS I SIT DOWN 
LET'S LOOK AT THAT AGAIN 
AT FIRST MY WEIGHT IS A BIGGER FORCE THAN THE UPWARD FORCE OF THE CUSHION SPRINGS SO I GO DOWN 
BUT THE MORE SQUASHED THE SPRINGS GET THE MORE THEY PUSH BACK 
EVENTUALLY THE FORCE PUSHING BACK EQUALS MY WEIGHT 
THE FORCES IN EACH DIRECTION BALANCE AND I STAY PUT 
IT'S CALLED EQUILIBRIUM 
OBJECTS DON'T HAVE TO BE STATIONARY TO HAVE BALANCED FORCES ACTING ON THEM 
AN OBJECT THAT MOVES IN A STRAIGHT LINE AT A CONSTANT SPEED ALSO HAS BALANCED FORCES ACTING ON IT 
EACH FORCE IS CANCELLED OUT BY AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE FORCE BUT IF YOU STOP AN OBJECT FROM MOVING 
THEN UNBALANCED FORCES ARE BEING EXERTED 
JAMIE ARE YOU USED TO PULLING LARGE WEIGHTS AROUND YES IN THE WORLD'S STRONGEST MAN COMPETITION 
WE CAN PULL BARGES BIG FIRE ENGINES EVEN AEROPLANES EXCELLENT I'VE GOT A DINKY LITTLE CARRIAGE FOR YOU 
YOU DON'T MIND NO NOT AT ALL BUT HOW WILL I MEASURE THE FORCE YOU'RE EXERTING TO GET THE CARRIAGE GOING 
I CAN ATTACH THIS FORCE METER ON TO MY HARNESS AND ON TO THE TRUCK 
AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE FORCE LET'S GET YOUR HARNESS O. K. 
GO IF I CONVERT THE READING ON THE FORCEOMETER INTO METRIC UNITS 
I CAN SEE THAT JAMIE MEASURED A FORCE OF FORTY FIVE KILONEWTONS 
THAT'S FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NEWTONS TO START THE CARRIAGE MOVING BUT HE DOESN'T NEED AS MUCH TO KEEP IT MOVING STOP 
HOW MUCH FORCE WILL HE NEED TO STOP IT 
JAMIE AWESOME OR WHAT 
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAD TO EXERT AN AWFUL LOT OF FORCE TO START THE CARRIAGE 
IT'S DIFFICULT STARTING THIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO OVERCOME FRICTION 
THEN IT'S JUST A CONSTANT FORCE TO KEEP IT MOVING 
TO MOVE THE DRAY JAMIE HAD TO UNBALANCE THE FORCES ACTING ON IT 
AS IT STARTS TO MOVE IT'S BEING ACCELERATED 
BY JAMIE PULLING WITH A FORCE GREATER THAN FRICTION 
BUT ONCE THE CARRIAGE WAS MOVING TO KEEP A CONSTANT SPEED 
HE JUST HAD TO BALANCE THE FORCES ACTING ON THE DRAY 
BUT TO SLOW DOWN OR STOP THE CARRIAGE ONCE AGAIN REQUIRED UNBALANCED FORCES 
SO REMEMBER IF AN OBJECT IS STATIONARY OR MOVING AT A CONSTANT SPEED AND DIRECTION 
THE FORCES ON AN OBJECT ARE BALANCED 
AN OBJECT THAT STARTS MOVING SLOWS DOWN CHANGES DIRECTION OR CHANGES SHAPE 
HAS UNBALANCED FORCES ACTING ON IT 
FORCES CAN CHANGE THE SHAPE OF SOMETHING WITHOUT MAKING IT SPEED UP SLOW DOWN OR CHANGE DIRECTION 
MY TOP TIP IS TO READ THROUGH THE GLOSSARY AND REMEMBER DEFINITIONS 
FOR BALANCED AND UNBALANCED FORCES YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THESE DEFINITIONS 
THIS IS THE END OF THE SECTION ON BALANCED AND UNBALANCED FORCES 
NEXT IT'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF FORCES 
WE'RE NOW GOING TO LOOK AT THREE IMPORTANT FORCES IN ACTION YOU NEED TO KNOW WELL 
THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL ON OUR MASS 
THE EFFECTS OF FRICTION AND THE EFFECTS OF AIR RESISTANCE 
FIRST GRAVITY THIS IS THE FORCE THAT ACTS ON ALL OBJECTS 
DUE TO THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE OBJECTS AND THE EARTH 
THE TWO OTHER FORCES ARE NOT OBVIOUS SO WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THEM 
HERE WE CAN SEE THAT THE FORWARD PUSH COMES FROM THE CYCLIST'S LEGS 
BUT WHERE DO THE FORCES WORKING AGAINST THIS PUSH COME FROM 
THIS FORCE WHICH CONSTANTLY RESISTS OR OPPOSES MOTION 
IS CALLED FRICTION 
IN OTHER WORDS FRICTION SLOWS THINGS DOWN 
BY ACTING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO MOTION 
FRICTION CAN OCCUR WHEN AN OBJECT MOVES AGAINST A SOLID SURFACE 
HERE THE BICYCLE TYRES MOVING AGAINST THE SURFACE OF THE TRACK 
FRICTION ALSO OCCURS WHEN AN OBJECT MOVES THROUGH LIQUIDS OR GASES 
HAVE YOU TRIED RUNNING THROUGH DEEP WATER OR CYCLING INTO A STRONG WIND 
HARD WORK WELL THAT'S FRICTION 
EVEN WHEN A SOLID SURFACE APPEARS 
TO BE VERY POLISHED AND SMOOTH TO THE NAKED EYE 
UNDER THE MICROSCOPE MANY BUMPS AND DIPS ARE VISIBLE 
THE IRREGULARITIES ON THE TWO SURFACES CATCH AGAINST EACH OTHER 
SLOWING DOWN MOVEMENT 
SO WHAT AFFECTS THE SIZE OF FRICTION 
A HEAVIER BIKE WILL EXPERIENCE MORE FRICTION 
AND SO NEEDS MORE EFFORT OR PUSH 
THAN A LIGHTER ONE ON THE SAME SURFACE 
BECAUSE THE GREATER THE MASS OF THE OBJECT THE GREATER THE FRICTION 
THE ROUGHER THE SURFACE 
THE GREATER THE FRICTION 
KNOBBLY TYRES CREATE GREATER FRICTION 
AND SO GRIP BETTER THAN SMOOTH TYRES 
THE GREATER THE AREA OF CONTACT BETWEEN THE SURFACES 
THE GREATER THE FRICTION 
WIDER MOUNTAIN BIKE TYRES PROVIDE MORE GRIP THAN THIN TYRES 
FRICTION CAN BE USEFUL OR A NUISANCE 
BUT WE CAN INCREASE IT OR REDUCE IT DEPENDING ON WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO 
WHEN WE WANT OBJECTS TO KEEP MOVING OR MOVE MORE EASILY 
WE REDUCE FRICTION BY SELECTING SMOOTHER SURFACES 
FOR EXAMPLE VERY SMOOTH TYRES REDUCE THE FRICTION 
ON A TRACK RACING BIKE 
USING LUBRICANTS ALSO REDUCES FRICTION 
LUBRICANTS PUT A FILM BETWEEN THE TWO SURFACES 
WHICH HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS SMOOTHING OUT THE SURFACES 
AND REDUCING THE FRICTION 
WHEN WE WANT THINGS TO SLOW DOWN OR STOP 
WE INCREASE FRICTION BY USING MATERIALS WITH ROUGHER SURFACES 
THE RUBBER USED FOR BRAKE BLOCKS HAS A ROUGH SURFACE 
THAT CREATES THE FRICTION AGAINST THE SMOOTH METAL RIM OF THE WHEEL 
FRICTION IS OUR SECOND FORCE IN ACTION 
SO WE'VE HAD GRAVITY AND FRICTION 
SO WHAT'S THE THIRD FORCE 
MOVING OBJECTS HAVE TO PUSH THEIR WAY THROUGH AIR 
AND THEY EXPERIENCE A FRICTIONAL FORCE AGAINST THEM 
CALLED AIR RESISTANCE OR DRAG 
WHEN AN OBJECT MOVES THROUGH THE AIR SLOWLY 
IT EXPERIENCES A SMALL AMOUNT OF AIR RESISTANCE 
AS IT GETS FASTER THE AIR RESISTANCE ON IT GETS BIGGER 
CYCLISTS TRY TO PRESENT A SMALLER SURFACE AREA BY DUCKING DOWN 
AND REDUCING THE FORCE EXERTED ON THEM 
CYCLISTS ALSO SLIPSTREAM BEHIND ANOTHER CYCLIST WHO DEFLECTS THE AIR 
AND REDUCES THE AIR RESISTANCE FOR THOSE TRAVELLING BEHIND 
THE LEADING CYCLIST HAS TO WORK MUCH HARDER 
TO OVERCOME THE FRICTIONAL FORCE OF THE AIR RES ISTANCE 
DESIGNERS USE THIS KNOWLEDGE IN THEIR DESIGNS TO DEVELOP SHAPES 
THAT ALLOW AIR TO SLIP PAST THEM MORE EASILY 
THESE BULLET SHAPED ROUNDED AND CURVED SHAPES 
LOOK MORE SLEEK AND SMOOTH 
AND ARE CALLED STREAMLINED OR AERODYNAMIC 
THEY SLIP THROUGH THE AIR MORE EASILY 
AND EXPERIENCE MUCH LESS DRAG OR AIR RESISTANCE 
IF AS IN SPACE THERE WAS NO FRICTION AND NO AIR RESISTANCE 
A MOVING OBJECT COULD GO ON MOVING FOR EVER 
SO FOR YOUR TEST YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE THREE DIFFERENT FORCES IN ACTION 
WE'VE LOOKED AT FORCES ACTING ON OBJECTS IN STRAIGHT LINES 
BUT FORCES CAN ALSO BE USED TO TURN OBJECTS ABOUT A PIVOT 
IF I TRY AND UNSCREW THIS NUT USING A SPANNER 
THE SPANNER EXERTS A TURNING FORCE ON THE NUT 
THIS TURNING FORCE IS CALLED A MOMENT 
IF THE MOMENT IS BIG ENOUGH IT WILL UNSCREW THE NUT 
BUT IF NOT THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF INCREASING THE MOMENT 
FIRST WE CAN INCREASE THE DISTANCE FROM THE FORCE TO THE PIVOT 
GET A LONGER HANDLED SPANNER 
I'M APPLYING THE SAME FORCE BUT THE DISTANCE FROM THE FORCE TO THE PIVOT IS INCREASED 
GIVING A GREATER MOMENT 
IF THAT DOESN'T WORK I CAN GO BACK TO MY SHORTER SPANNER AND USE BOTH HANDS A GREATER FORCE 
THE INCREASED FORCE ALSO MEANS A GREATER MOMENT 
AND THIS TIME I THINK IT'S WORKING 
THE MOMENT OF A FORCE CAN BE DESCRIBED BY THIS EQUATION 
SO IF I EXERT A FORCE OF SEVENTY NEWTONS 
AND THE DISTANCE FROM MY HAND TO THE PIVOT IS OH ONE METRES 
WE'VE GOT THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO WORK OUT THE MOMENT 
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER PIVOT THIS TIME A SEESAW 
THE PIVOT IS AT THE CENTRE OF THE SEESAW 
IF WE PLACE AN OBJECT ON EACH END THEY EXERT A MOMENT ABOUT THE PIVOT 
AND IF THESE TWO MOMENTS ARE EQUAL THEN THE SEESAW IS BALANCED 
THIS IS KNOWN AS THE PRINCIPLE OF MOMENTS SO WHEN BALANCED 
THE TOTAL CLOCKWISE MOMENT EQUALS THE TOTAL ANTI CLOCKWISE MOMENT 
SO IF KIRK HERE WEIGHS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NEWTONS AND IS TWO METRES AWAY FROM THE PIVOT 
WHERE MUST KEN WHO WEIGHS THREE HUNDRED NEWTONS SIT SO THAT THE SEESAW IS BALANCED 
STOP HERE AND SEE IF YOU CAN WORK THE ANSWER OUT 
LET'S LOOK AT HOW YOU WOULD WORK OUT THIS PROBLEM 
WHEN BALANCED THE TOTAL CLOCKWISE MOMENT EQUALS THE TOTAL ANTI CLOCKWISE MOMENT 
KEN HAS TO SIT SIXTEEN METRES AWAY FROM THE PIVOT FOR THE SEESAW TO BE BALANCED 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THIS UNIT ON FORCES AND MOTION 
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW ALL THE FORMULAE NEEDED FOR DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS 
IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER ALL OF THEM WHY NOT REWIND AND GO BACK OVER THE KEY POINTS 
THIS UNIT IS SPLIT INTO TWO SECTIONS 
THE FIRST LOOKS AT LIGHT THE SECOND COVERS SOUND 
LET'S START WITH THE BEHAVIOUR OF LIGHT AND SHADOWS 
LIGHT IS A FORM OF ENERGY THAT TRAVELS AT INCREDIBLY HIGH SPEED 
AND WE DETECT IT BY USING OUR EYES BUT WHERE DOES IT COME FROM 
WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THIS LIGHT AND WHY DO SOME THINGS APPEAR BRIGHTER THAN OTHERS 
WHY CAN WE SEE A CAT'S EYES IN THE DARK THEY GLOW DON'T THEY 
THEY'RE REALLY BRIGHT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN SEE IN THE DARK 
CATS CAN SEE IN THE DARK CAN'T THEY I DON'T KNOW 
WE NEED SCIENCE IN ACTION TO INVESTIGATE I'M ON TO IT 
MY DARK LAB SEEMS THE PERFECT PLACE TO START 
MAYBE BOFFIN HERE CAN HELP 
SO WHY CAN I SEE HER EYES IN THE DARK 
THE LIGHT FROM THE TORCH REFLECTS OFF BOFFIN'S EYES AND ENTERS MINE SO I CAN SEE THEM 
WITHOUT A LIGHT SOURCE I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING AT ALL 
WE CAN SEE LUMINOUS SOURCES 
LIKE OPTICAL FIBRES LIGHT BULBS THE SUN AND OTHER STARS 
BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT THEY GIVE OUT WHICH ENTERS OUR EYES 
WE CAN ALSO SEE NON LUMINOUS OBJECTS THAT DON'T GIVE OFF LIGHT 
BECAUSE LIGHT FROM A LUMINOUS SOURCE IS REFLECTED OFF THEM INTO OUR EYES 
YOUR DIAGRAM WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS 
THE ARROW LEAVES THE LIGHT SOURCE HITS THE BOOK 
AND THEN REFLECTS BACK AND TRAVELS TO YOUR EYES 
MAKE SURE YOU DRAW THE ARROWS LEAVING THE LIGHT SOURCE 
AND TRAVELLING TOWARDS YOUR EYES AND NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
MOST SURFACES REFLECT LIGHT BUT UNLIKE MOST EVERYDAY THINGS 
MIRRORS HAVE A SMOOTH SURFACE AND THEREFORE REFLECT LIGHT IN A REGULAR AND PREDICTABLE WAY 
LIGHT IS REFLECTED FROM A MIRROR AT THE SAME ANGLE AS IT HITS IT 
AND LIGHT ONLY TRAVELS IN STRAIGHT LINES 
EVERYTHING YOU SEE IS A RESULT OF LIGHT TRAVELLING INTO YOUR EYES 
AND LIGHT CAN ONLY TRAVEL IN STRAIGHT LINES LIKE THIS 
YOU COULD SEE ROUND CORNERS 
AND AS WE CAN SEE FROM THIS THAT'S NOT THE CASE 
WE CAN ONLY SEE THIS LIGHT WHEN ALL THE HOLES ARE LINED UP IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
YOU CAN SEE THIS HAPPENING WHEN I USE THIS FLEXIBLE MIRROR 
IF WE LOOK CLOSER UP WE CAN SEE THE LIGHT RAYS SHINING DIRECTLY ON TO THE SURFACE OF THE MIRROR 
WHEN I USE THIS PRONG TO BEND THE MIRROR'S SURFACE 
THE LIGHT RAYS BOUNCE OFF THE MIRROR'S SURFACE AT DIFFERENT ANGLES GIVING A DISTORTED IMAGE 
BUT WHEN THE SURFACE IS FLAT 
THE REFLECTED RAYS OF LIGHT ARE PARALLEL THEY ALL REFLECT BACK IN THE SAME DIRECTION 
AND WHEN THOSE RAYS GO INTO MY EYE I SEE AN UNDISTORTED IMAGE OF MYSELF 
A MIRROR IS A FLAT SHINY SURFACE 
AND MOST OF THE LIGHT THAT HITS IT REFLECTS OR BOUNCES BACK 
HOW MIRRORS REFLECT LIGHT IS A KEY CONCEPT IN THIS UNIT 
AND FOR YOUR TEST YOU REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT WELL 
THE RAY OF LIGHT STRIKING THE MIRROR IS CALLED THE INCIDENT RAY 
AND THE RAY LEAVING THE MIRROR IS CALLED THE REFLECTED RAY 
THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE IS MEASURED WITH A PROTRACTOR 
FROM THE DOTTED LINE THE NORMAL 
AND THIS ANGLE OF INCIDENCE I. 
WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME AS THE ANGLE OF REFLECTION R. 
WE SAW THAT LIGHT IS REFLECTED WHEN IT HITS A SHINY SURFACE 
BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT MEETS A TRANSPARENT MATERIAL 
TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THE STICK 
IT LOOKS AS IF IT HAS A BEND IN IT A SHARP BEND 
BUT FROM HERE IT LOOKS NORMAL PERFECTLY STRAIGHT AND NO BENDS 
WHEN LIGHT TRAVELS FROM AIR INTO WATER OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT LETS LIGHT THROUGH LIKE GLASS AND PLASTIC 
IT GETS BENT IT CHANGES DIRECTION 
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE ALL OF THESE SHAPES ARE MADE OUT OF GLASS 
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE ALL OF THESE SHAPES ARE MADE OUT OF GLASS 
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE ALL OF THESE SHAPES ARE MADE OUT OF GLASS 
GLASS LETS LIGHT THROUGH IT LIKE WATER DOES IT'S TRANSPARENT 
SEE HOW THE LIGHT BENDS AS LIGHT PASSES THROUGH THEM 
THE MOST BENDING TAKES PLACE AT THE EDGES 
WHERE THE LIGHT MOVES FROM AIR TO GLASS OR GLASS TO AIR 
THIS BENDING EFFECT IS CALLED REFRACTION 
AND WE CAN USE IT TO DO SOME USEFUL THINGS 
REFRACTION IS CAUSED BY THE SPEED OF THE LIGHT CHANGING AS IT PASSES INTO ONE SUBSTANCE FROM ANOTHER 
BUT IF THE LIGHT PASSES INTO AND OUT OF ONE OF THESE TRANSPARENT MATERIALS 
AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE SURFACE 
THEN THE LIGHT RAY PASSES THROUGH WITH NO CHANGE OF DIRECTION 
THIS TIME LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WHITE LIGHT PASSES THROUGH A GLASS PRISM 
IF I PASS THE LIGHT THROUGH A PRISM 
IT'S REFRACTED BUT SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS 
WHITE LIGHT ENTERING THE PRISM BUT ALL THESE COLOURS COMING OUT 
WELL THIS IS DISPERSION 
WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING IS WHAT MAKES UP WHITE LIGHT 
ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW 
AND THIS IS WHY THE SKY IS BLUE AND A SUNSET IS ORANGE 
THIS RANGE OF COLOURS THAT'S PRODUCED BY THE DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT IS CALLED A SPECTRUM 
AND FOR YOUR TEST YOU NEED TO KNOW THE NAMES AND THE ORDER OF THE COLOURS 
THIS RANGE OF COLOURS CAN BE REMEMBERED USING THIS PHRASE 
STARTING WITH R. FOR RED 
O. FOR ORANGE Y. FOR YELLOW 
G. FOR GREEN 
B. FOR BLUE 
I FOR INDIGO 
AND V. FOR VIOLET 
FOR YOUR TEST YOU NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT REFRACTION AND DISPERSION 
HERE ARE SOME KEY DEFINITIONS TO HELP YOU 
MY TOP TIP IS TO REVISE WITH FRIENDS 
FIRST OF ALL COLOURED FILTERS 
THESE ARE TRANSLUCENT THEY ALLOW SOME LIGHT TO PASS THROUGH 
WHILE SOME OF THE LIGHT IS ABSORBED BY THE FILTER 
THE COLOUR OF THE LIGHT IS THE COLOUR OF THE FILTER THAT IT PASSES THROUGH 
THE FILTER HAS ABSORBED ALL OF THE OTHER COLOURS 
HERE WE HAVE USED A MAGENTA FILTER AND A BLUE FIL ER 
TO CREATE THIS BACKDROP 
NO COLOURED FILTER AND WE ARE LEFT WITH WHITE LIGHT 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THIS SECTION ON LIGHT 
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT THOSE LIGHT RAY DIAGRAMS REWIND AND GO OVER THE KEY POINTS AGAIN 
LIKE LIGHT SOUND IS ALSO A FORM OF ENERGY BUT IT TRAVELS MUCH MORE SLOWLY THAN LIGHT 
THIS IS WHY EVENTS CAN BE SEEN FIRST AND HEARD LATER 
DURING A STORM WE SEE THE LIGHTNING FIRST AND THEN HEAR THE THUNDER 
SOUND ALWAYS NEEDS SOMETHING TO MOVE THROUGH 
WE CAN SHOW THIS IF WE PUT THE CLOCK INSIDE THIS SPECIAL JAR 
THE RINGING BECOMES QUIETER BECAUSE THE CLOCK IS NOW INSIDE THE JAR 
THE AIR INSIDE THE JAR CAN BE PUMPED OUT 
THE GAUGE SHOWS THAT WITH EACH PUMP MORE AND MORE AIR IS BEING REMOVED 
MOST OF THE AIR HAS NOW BEEN PUMPED OUT 
THE BELL IS STILL RINGING BUT WE CAN'T HEAR IT 
AS THE AIR IS ALLOWED BACK IN THE BELL CAN BE HEARD ONCE AGAIN 
THIS SHOWS THAT SOUND VIBRATIONS NEED SOMETHING TO TRAVEL THROUGH HERE IT'S AIR 
ANOTHER DIFFERENCE IS THAT BECAUSE LIGHT IS A FORM OF RADIATION IT CAN TRAVEL THROUGH SPACE A VACUUM 
BUT SOUND CAN'T 
IT TRAVELS AS VIBRATIONS OF THE PARTICLES OF A MEDIUM WHICH CAN BE A SOLID LIQUID OR GAS 
BUT EXACTLY HOW DOES SOUND TRAVEL 
AS I PULL THE BOW ACROSS THE STRING 
THE BOW MAKES THE STRING VIBRATE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS VERY QUICKLY 
BY USING A STROBE LIGHT WE CAN SEE THE INDIVIDUAL VIBRATIONS MORE CLEARLY 
ALL MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS NEED SOMETHING TO VIBRATE TO MAKE THE SOUND 
THIS LOUD SOUND IS CAUSED BY MY LIPS VIBRATING 
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOUND WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT WAVES 
VIBRATING OBJECTS SUCH AS MY VOCAL CORDS SET THE AIR AROUND THEM VIBRATING 
THE PARTICLES OF AIR VIBRATE CREATING THE WAVES THAT TRANSMIT THE SOUND 
IMAGINE YOU COULD SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE AIR AS I HIT THE SKIN OF THE DRUM 
THE AIR IS MADE UP OF MANY TINY PARTICLES THAT SURROUND THE DRUM SKIN 
WHEN I HIT THE DRUM THE AIR PARTICLES NEXT TO THE DRUM SKIN VIBRATE AND COLLIDE WITH EACH OTHER 
IN SLOW MOTION YOU CAN SEE THE VIBRATION PASS ALONG THE LINE OF AIR PARTICLES 
IT'S CALLED A COMPRESSION WAVE 
BECAUSE THE PARTICLES ARE COMPRESSED TOGETHER 
WHERE IS THAT NOISE COMING FROM 
HOW CAN I CONCENTRATE WITH ALL THAT 
THERE'S SOMEONE OUT HERE WHO KNOWS A LOT ABOUT SOUND 
MAYBE SHE CAN HELP 
THAT'S FINE LET'S TAKE A BREAK 
VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT IT DOESN'T HELP ME CONCENTRATE 
I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT MEDIUM SOUND TRAVELS THROUGH 
BUT ALL I HEAR IS THEIR MUSIC IN A CONCRETE ROOM WITH A WOODEN DOOR 
I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF THINK 
THERE'S TWO MATERIALS SOUND TRAVELS THROUGH WOOD AND SOLID CONCRETE 
HOW DOES SOUND DO THAT GO THROUGH A SOLID CONCRETE WALL 
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING A MUSIC BOX 
GO TO THAT CORNER OF THE HALL YOU'LL FIND EQUIPMENT FOR AN EXPERIMENT 
THERE'S NO SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT JUST A TIN AND STRING 
THAT'S IT CAN YOU HEAR THE MUSIC BOX NO NO CHANCE 
NOW PUT THE TIN TO YOUR EAR 
NO PROBLEM 
IT'S LIKE A STRING TELEPHONE EXACTLY 
NOT ONLY DOES SOUND TRAVEL THROUGH SOLIDS 
IT TRAVELS THROUGH SOME SOLID OBJECTS BETTER THAN THROUGH AIR 
WHAT ARE THE GIRLS DOING 
THEY'RE SYNCHRONISED SWIMMERS REHEARSING A ROUTINE UNDERWATER 
THEY'LL HAVE A PROBLEM HEARING IT 
DO YOU THINK SO 
SO SOUND SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM TRAVELLING THROUGH WATER 
I HAVE A SPECIALLY DESIGNED MICROPHONE TO GO UNDERWATER 
IT'S WIRED UP TO A SPEAKER SO WE HEAR WHAT IT'S PICKING UP 
O. K. 
ABOVE THE WATER I CAN'T HEAR THE SUBMARINE'S MOTORS AT ALL 
BUT UNDERWATER WHAT HAPPENS WILL THE MICROPHONE PICK UP THE SOUNDS 
NO PROBLEM 
WITH THEIR WATERPROOF SPEAKER 
THE GIRLS DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM HEARING THE MUSIC AFTER ALL 
THE QUESTION ASKED YOU TO WRITE DOWN THE NAMES OF THE DIFFERENT MATERIALS 
YOU CAN SEE SOUND TRAVEL THROUGH 
SO HOW DID YOU GET ON 
SOUNDS VARY IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS THEY CAN VARY IN LOUDNESS 
THAT'S THE AMPLITUDE 
THAT IS THEIR FREQUENCY LET'S LOOK AT AMPLITUDE FIRST 
WOW WAS THAT THE SOUND THAT WAS CAUSING THE PAPER TO MOVE LIKE THAT 
YES BUT I HAD TO MAKE A VERY LOUD SOUND TO DO IT 
WHAT ACTUALLY MAKES SOUNDS LOUD 
SOUND IS CAUSED BY THINGS THAT VIBRATE 
THE BIGGER THE VIBRATION THE LOUDER THE SOUND 
WHEN I HIT THIS DRUM GENTLY THE VIBRATION IS VERY SMALL 
THE POLYSTYRENE BALLS ONLY JUST MOVE AND THE SOUND IS QUIET 
THE LOUDNESS OF THE SOUND DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE VIBRATIONS 
WHEN YOU TAP THIS GLASS IT MAKES A SOUND AS IT VIBRATES 
THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT COUNTS HOW MANY TIMES A SECOND IT VIBRATES 
THE RATE AT WHICH SOMETHING VIBRATES IS CALLED ITS FREQUENCY 
FREQUENCY IS MEASURED IN HERTZ 
THIS GLASS IS VIBRATING FOUR HUNDRED TIMES A SECOND 
SO THE SOUND HAS A FREQUENCY OF FOUR HUNDRED HZ 
FREQUENCY IS THE NUMBER OF VIBRATIONS A SOUND PRODUCES 
IN ONE SECOND IT WILL AFFECT HOW HIGH OR LOW THE SOUND IS 
THAT IS ITS PITCH LET'S HAVE ANOTHER LISTEN 
I'VE GOT MY OWN FREQUENCY GENERATOR HERE 
NOW WHEN I SHORTEN THE LENGTH OF THE OVERHANGING RULER 
THE FREQUENCY OF VIBRATION INCREASES 
YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND CHANGE 
IT GOES UP IN PITCH LISTEN 
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN SEE SOUND WAVES IS TO USE AN OSCILLOSCOPE 
A MICROPHONE CAN BE CONNECTED TO IT 
SO THAT WHEN A SOUND IS MADE A TRACE IS SEEN ON A SCREEN 
THE AMPLITUDE IS THE DISTANCE FROM THE CENTRAL POSITION 
TO THE TOP OR BOTTOM OF THE WAVE 
THE WAVELENGTH IS THE LENGTH OF EACH COMPLETE WAVE 
AND THE FREQUENCY IS THE NUMBER OF VIBRATIONS EACH SECOND 
THE MORE WAVES IN A SECOND THE HIGHER THE PITCH 
IF THE AMPLITUDE OF A WAVE INCREASES 
THE HEIGHT OF THE WAVES GETS BIGGER REPRESENTING A LOUDER SOUND 
WE HEAR SOUNDS 
BECAUSE VIBRATIONS IN THE AIR CAUSE OUR EARDRUMS TO VIBRATE 
THESE VIBRATIONS PASS FROM THE EARDRUM THROUGH THREE SMALL BONES 
THE OSSICLES TO THE INNER EAR 
THE RANGE OF HUMAN HEARING IS EXCEEDED IN NATURE BY MANY ANIMALS 
BUT OUR HEARING SENSITIVITY IS REMARKABLE 
A GOOD EAR CAN DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN SOME ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES 
HUMANS CAN HEAR SOUNDS THAT HAVE FREQUENCIES FROM ABOUT TWENTY HZ 
TO ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND HZ BUT NOT EVERYBODY HEARS THE ENTIRE RANGE 
EXPOSURE TO LOUD SOUNDS CAUSES HEARING LOSS 
PARTLY THROUGH EXCESSIVE WEAR OF THE OSSICLES 
A VERY LOUD SOUND CAN CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE 
WELL DONE YOU'VE FINISHED THE SECTIONS ON LIGHT AND SOUND 
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE OF ANYTHING REWIND AND WATCH IT AGAIN 
THIS UNIT IS ABOUT THE EARTH AND BEYOND IT'S IN FOUR SECTIONS 
LET'S FIRST LOOK AT THE MOVEMENT OF OUR OWN PLANET EARTH 
AS YOU WATCH THIS PROGRAMME WE DON'T HAVE A SENSATION OF MOVEMENT 
IT'S NOT OBVIOUS THAT EARTH IS MOVING THROUGH SPACE 
AT THOUSANDS OF METRES PER SECOND 
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT EARLY ASTRONOMERS MADE THE MISTAKE 
OF THINKING THE SUN MOVES AROUND THE EARTH 
HOW DO WE GO FROM DAY TO NIGHT 
IT'S NIGHT TIME IN PART OF THE WORLD BUT IT'S DAYTIME IN OTHER PARTS 
BRITAIN FACES THE SUN IT'S DAYTIME 
BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD IS IN DARKNESS 
IN AUSTRALIA IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 
BUT THE EARTH ROTATES 
AS IT ROTATES PARTS THAT WERE FACING THE SUN TURN AWAY FROM IT 
THE EARTH ROTATES ONE COMPLETE TURN EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
SO DAY IS FOLLOWED BY NIGHT IS FOLLOWED BY DAY 
FOR MOST OF THE WORLD 
THAT ACCOUNTS FOR DAILY CHANGES FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT 
BUT WHAT ABOUT DIFFERENT SEASONS HOW DOES THE MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH CAUSE SEASONAL CHANGES 
THIS IS THE KIND OF QUESTION THAT APPEARS IN THE TEST SO WATCH THIS NEXT CLIP CAREFULLY 
IN WINTER THE NORTH POLE IS TILTED AWAY FROM THE SUN 
BUT AS THE EARTH MOVES AROUND THE SUN YOU SEE THE AMOUNT OF DAYLIGHT INCREASING IN THE NORTH 
THE DAYS GET LONGER IN THE NORTH IN SPRINGTIME 
BY JUNE THE EARTH HAS MOVED ROUND THE SUN SO THE NORTH POLE IS NOW TILTED TOWARDS THE SUN 
THE EARTH TAKES A WHOLE YEAR TO ORBIT THE SUN AND IT'S THIS THAT GIVES US SEASONS 
THE EARTH ORBITS THE SUN ONCE EVERY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE AND A QUARTER DAYS WHICH MAKES A YEAR 
IT'S THIS COMBINATION OF THE ORBIT AND THE TILT ON ITS AXIS THAT GIVES US DIFFERENT SEASONS 
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER LOOK 
IN WINTER THE NORTH END OF THE EARTH'S AXIS TILTS AWAY FROM THE SUN 
THIS MEANS IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE THE WEATHER IS COLDER AND NIGHT TIME IS LONGER THAN DAYTIME 
THIS IS DIRECTLY OPPOSITE TO WHAT HAPPENS IN SUMMER 
WHEN THE EARTH'S AXIS IS TILTED TOWARDS THE SUN WHEN WEATHER IS WARMER AND DAYLIGHT HOURS LONGER 
AT NIGHT THE STARS APPEAR TO MOVE ACROSS THE SKY 
DURING THE DAY THE SUN ALSO APPEARS TO MOVE ACROSS THE SKY 
BUT OF COURSE WE NOW KNOW THAT BOTH THE SUN AND THE STARS' APPARENT DAILY MOVEMENT 
IS BECAUSE OF THE EARTH'S CONSTANT ROTATION ABOUT ITS AXIS LET'S LOOK MORE CLOSELY 
IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE ON A SUMMER'S DAY THE SUN APPEARS TO MOVE IN A CURVE ACROSS THE SKY 
IT RISES IN THE EAST AND SETS BELOW THE HORIZON IN THE WEST 
BUT DURING THE WINTER WHEN WE'RE TILTED AWAY FROM THE SUN 
THE SUN WILL FOLLOW A DIFFERENT ARC ACROSS THE SKY 
SO IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE IN WINTER THE SUN NOW FOLLOWS A MUCH SHALLOWER ARC 
DAYTIME IS SHORTER THAN NIGHT TIME GIVING US COLDER DAYS THAN THE LONG DAYLIGHT HOURS IN THE SUMMER 
DURING NIGHT TIME HOURS STARS ALSO APPEAR TO MOVE ACROSS THE SKY IN CURVED PATHS 
APART FROM THE POLE STAR BECAUSE IT IS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE NORTH POLE IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO MOVE 
WE'RE NOW GOING TO LOOK AT THE SOLAR SYSTEM WHICH OUR PLANET EARTH IS PART OF 
THE SOLAR SYSTEM IS MADE UP OF THE SUN WHICH SITS IN THE MIDDLE 
AND THE NINE MAJOR PLANETS WHICH SURROUND IT THESE MOVE AROUND THE SUN IN SQUASHED CIRCLES 
CALLED THEIR ORBITS AND ALL OF THEM INCLUDING EARTH STAY IN ORBIT AND DON'T GO CARTWHEELING INTO SPACE 
BECAUSE OF THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF THE SUN 
LIKE OTHER STARS THE SUN IS A LIGHT SOURCE 
REMEMBER WE CAN ONLY SEE THE PLANETS BECAUSE LIGHT FROM THE SUN IS REFLECTED OFF THEM TO US 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THE ORDER OF THE PLANETS WELL THESE NEXT CLIPS WILL HELP YOU 
WHAT WE CALL OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IS A FAMILY OF NINE PLANETS MOVING AROUND THE SUN 
THEIR PREDICTABLE PATHS ARE CALLED ORBITS 
CLOSEST TO THE SUN IS THE PLANET MERCURY 
NEXT COMES VENUS AND THEN OUR OWN PLANET EARTH 
STILL MOVING AWAY FROM THE SUN OUR OTHER NEIGHBOUR IS MARS THE RED PLANET 
SO FAR WE'VE GOT MERCURY NEAREST THE SUN THEN VENUS 
THEN OUR OWN PLANET EARTH AND THEN THE RED PLANET MARS 
THAT TAKES US UP TO FOUR THE INNER PLANETS WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER PLANETS 
WHAT ARE THESE OUTER PLANETS 
THE FIRST IS JUPITER ORBITING SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION KILOMETRES AWAY FROM THE SUN 
THEN COMES SATURN DOUBLE THAT DISTANCE AWAY 
NEXT IS URANUS 
THEN NEPTUNE AND FINALLY PLUTO WITH ITS STRANGE ORBIT 
THESE OTHER PLANETS ARE THOUGHT TO BE VERY SIMILAR BUT THEY ARE SO FAR AWAY 
THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO SEE WITH GROUND BASED TELESCOPES 
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE INTERNATIONAL ASTRONOMERS UNION VOTED TO STRIP PLUTO OF ITS STATUS AS A PLANET 
IT IS NOW RECOGNISED TO BE A DWARF PLANET BUT CHECK WITH YOUR TEACHER FOR THE LATEST NEWS 
OFFICIALLY THERE ARE NOW EIGHT PLANETS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
HERE IS A FUN WAY TO REMEMBER THEM ALL 
YOU CAN USE THIS MNEMONIC OR MAKE ONE UP YOURSELF 
O. K. HOW DID YOU DO 
THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL IS BIGGEST WHEN THE PLANET IS NEAREST THE SUN 
AGAIN IT'S TRAVELLING FASTEST WHEN IT IS NEAREST THE SUN 
FIRST LET'S SORT OUT WHAT A SATELLITE IS 
IT'S A BODY THAT ORBITS MOVES AROUND A MUCH LARGER BODY 
FOR YOUR TEST YOU NEED TO KNOW THE TWO TYPES OF SATELLITE 
NATURAL SATELLITES AND ARTIFICIAL ONES LET'S LOOK AT NATURAL SATELLITES FIRST 
THE EARTH AND THE OTHER PLANETS ARE NATURAL SATELLITES OF THE SUN 
THE MOON IS A NATURAL SATELLITE OF THE EARTH 
THE OTHER SATELLITES YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ARE ARTIFICIAL ONES 
THESE MOVE AROUND THE EARTH AND WERE PUT INTO ORBIT BY US 
THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES MAKE A NOTE OF THE DIFFERENT ONES AS WE RUN THROUGH THESE NEXT CLIPS 
THESE MACHINES ARE LAUNCHED INTO SPACE FOR MANY DIFFERENT USES 
SOME SATELLITES COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT THE WEATHER AND MONITOR CHANGES IN CONDITIONS 
OTHERS ARE USED FOR NAVIGATION TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND COLLECTING INFORMATION ON THE EARTH'S SURFACE 
INCLUDING SPYING 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THIS UNIT ABOUT THE EARTH AND BEYOND 
MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THE EARTH MOVES AROUND THE SUN 
AND WHERE IT APPEARS IN THE ORDER OF PLANETS 
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE OF ANY POINTS REWIND AND GO THROUGH THEM AGAIN 
THERE'S ONE THING FOR SURE IN LIFE WE ALL NEED ENERGY TO DO ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING 
TO MOVE MAKE A CUP OF TEA ALL THESE THINGS NEED ENERGY 
AND ENERGY CAN COME IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FORMS YOU MUST KNOW THE MOST COMMON ONES 
FIRST OF ALL LIGHT WE NEED IT TO SEE AND PLANTS NEED IT FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
LUMINOUS OBJECTS INCLUDING THE SUN GIVE OUT LIGHT OUR FIRST FORM OF ENERGY 
POTENTIAL ENERGY MEANS STORED ENERGY 
ENERGY CAN BE STORED IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
LIFTING SOMETHING UP STORES GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY 
ANYTHING THAT CAN FALL OR MOVE DOWN HAS GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY WHICH IT CAN TRANSFER LATER 
ENERGY CAN BE STORED CHEMICALLY IN FOOD FUEL OR BATTERIES 
ELASTIC POTENTIAL ENERGY IS IN A RUBBER BAND OR SPRING 
SO THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF POTENTIAL ENERGY GRAVITATIONAL CHEMICAL AND ELASTIC 
ANOTHER FORM OF ENERGY IS SOUND CREATED BY ANY VIBRATING OBJECT 
OUR MOST CONVENIENT FORM OF ENERGY IS ELECTRICAL 
HUNDREDS OF APPLIANCES AT HOME OR IN INDUSTRY NEED ELECTRICITY TO WORK 
SO A BATTERY OR GENERATOR IN A POWER STATION ARE SOURCES OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY 
THERMAL ENERGY OR HEAT ENERGY IS NEXT ANYTHING HOT LIKE THIS WATER OR BURNING COAL PRODUCES HEAT 
THERMAL ENERGY 
SO LET'S JUST RUN THROUGH WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT A FEW LESS OBVIOUS ONES 
THIS MOVING CAR HAS KINETIC ENERGY 
THE FASTER IT MOVES THE GREATER ITS KINETIC ENERGY 
ANY MOVING OBJECT HAS KINETIC ENERGY AND FINALLY 
WHAT DO THESE HAVE IN COMMON A JACK IN A BOX A BATTERY AND FOOD 
ALL THESE CONTAIN STORED ENERGY READY TO BE RELEASED 
WE CALL THIS POTENTIAL ENERGY 
THE JACK IN THE BOX CONTAINS A SPRING AND BY COMPRESSING THE STRING ENERGY IS STORED 
SO IF I OPENED THIS CATCH THE STORED ENERGY IN THE SPRING IS RELEASED 
LET'S ADD THESE TO OUR LIST 
IF YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT WHY NOT STOP THE PROGRAMME OR CARRY ON FOR THE ANSWER 
SO THREE DIFFERENT FORMS OF ENERGY HOW DID YOU GET ON 
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE REWIND THIS SECTION AND GO THROUGH THE DIFFERENT ENERGY FORMS AGAIN 
MUCH OF THE ENERGY USED TO RUN OUR HOMES INDUSTRIES AND TRANSPORT IS PRODUCED BY BURNING FUELS 
IN VAST QUANTITIES THESE FUELS SUCH AS COAL OIL OR NATURAL GAS ARE CALLED FOSSIL FUELS 
BECAUSE THEY WERE FORMED FROM DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO 
COAL IS WHAT WE CALL A FOSSIL FUEL 
SO CALLED BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF PLANTS THAT DIED ALL THAT TIME AGO 
OIL AND GAS THE OTHER FOSSIL FUELS WERE FORMED IN MUCH THE SAME WAY USUALLY UNDER THE SEA 
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW WE'D GET ALONG WITHOUT FUELS LIKE THESE 
BUT IN THE FUTURE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE MAY HAVE TO DO 
ESTIMATES FOR THE LIFETIME OF REMAINING FOSSIL FUELS VARY 
BUT SHORTAGES ARE ALREADY CAUSING THE PRICE OF PETROL TO RISE 
AND BURNING FOSSIL FUELS RELEASES CARBON DIOXIDE A GREENHOUSE GAS 
INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF THESE GASES CAUSES GLOBAL WARMING 
THE OTHER ENERGY RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR US TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY ARE CALLED RENEWABLE OR SUSTAINABLE 
AS THE WORD SUGGESTS THIS MEANS THAT THESE ENERGY RESOURCES CAN BE REPLACED 
AND THEY DON'T RUN OUT IN THIS NEXT CLIP MAKE A NOTE OF THE DIFFERENT EXAMPLES WE SEE 
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES LIKE WIND AND WAVE POWER DO NOT RUN OUT 
THEY'RE USED TO DRIVE TURBINES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY 
THE SUN'S POWER CAN BE DIRECTLY CAPTURED USING SOLAR CELLS BUT THEY DON'T WORK AT NIGHT 
BIOMASS IS ANY PLANT OR ANIMAL MATERIAL THAT CAN BE USED AS FUEL TO PRODUCE ENERGY 
AND FINALLY HYDRO ELECTRIC POWER WATER FROM A LARGE DAM IS USED TO TURN TURBINES 
ALL OF THESE ENERGY RESOURCES CAN GENERATE ELECTRICITY 
BUT AT THE MOMENT MOST OF IT IS PRODUCED BY NON RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES FOSSIL FUELS 
ENERGY IN THE FORM OF ELECTRICITY IS NOT STORED EASILY IN LARGE AMOUNTS 
IT HAS TO BE PRODUCED WHEN IT'S NEEDED MOST ELECTRICITY IS GENERATED IN POWER STATIONS 
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENERGY RESOURCE YOU NEED TO KNOW 
BRILLIANT YOU'VE REACHED THE END OF THE SECOND SCIENCE PROGRAMME 
WHICH HAS COVERED A LOT OF THE PHYSICS AND SOME CHEMISTRY YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR YOUR TEST 
DON'T FORGET PROGRAMME ONE COVERED LOADS MORE CHEMISTRY AND MOST OF THE BIOLOGY YOU NEED TO HAVE REVISED 
ALWAYS PLAN TIME FOR YOUR REVISION 
IF THERE ARE ANY AREAS YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE OF USE THE MAIN MENU TO FIND THE BIT YOU NEED HELP WITH 
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW BEST OF LUCK IN YOUR TESTS
