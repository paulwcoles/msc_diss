BLACKPOOL ONE OF THE TEN MOST POPULAR TOURIST SPOTS IN THE WORLD 
LAST SUMMER THE B. B. C. WAS GRANTED EXCLUSIVE ACCESS 
TO THE REGION'S AMBULANCE CREWS AND TO BLACKPOOL VICTORIA'S HOSPITAL ONE OF THE BUSIEST IN THE COUNTRY 
SIX MONTHS LATER WE'RE BACK TO SEE HOW OUR BLACKPOOL MEDICS COPE 
WITH THE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THAT WINTER BRINGS 
TONIGHT A PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE 
TWO YEAR OLD LEWIS IS RUSHED INTO INTENSIVE CARE IN A CRITICAL CONDITION 
BLOOD WAS COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH THAT'S WHEN I PANICKED BECAUSE HE SEEMED TO HAVE GONE ALL JERKY 
ON THE FRONTLINE WITH BLACKPOOL'S PARAMEDICS 
I CAN'T BREATHE ALL RIGHT 
KILL OR CURE THE MAJOR SURGERY THAT IS DENNIS SUTTON'S ONLY CHANCE OF SURVIVAL 
DON'T UPSET YOURSELF 
IN THE YEAR OF ITS SIXTIETH BIRTHDAY THIS IS THE N. H. S. THROUGH THE EYES OF THE MEDICS WHOSE JOB IT IS 
TO KEEP THE NATION HEALTHY AND TO SAVE LIVES TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS 
TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY IN BLACKPOOL VICTORIA HOSPITAL FOR EIGHTY THREE YEAR OLD MURIEL FANCY 
SHE'S BEEN ADMITTED FOR LIFE SAVING HEART SURGERY 
I'M HAVING A VALVE REPLACEMENT 
IT'S THE MAIN ARTERY THAT'S BLOCKED 
IT'S HARDENED 
I'M FEELING JUST A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE 
WHICH I SUPPOSE IS NATURAL 
AND JUST WONDERING EXACTLY 
I SUPPOSE HOW THINGS WILL TURN OUT 
HEART SURGEON RUSSELL MILNER IS IN CHARGE OF MURIEL'S CARE 
HE'S A VETERAN OF MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND HEART OPERATIONS SPANNING FIFTEEN YEARS 
ARE YOU ALL READY FOR TOMORROW 
NOT REALLY NO 
ALL RIGHT FAIR ENOUGH THINGS I NEED TO MENTION TO YOU 
UNOPERATED YOU WILL EVENTUALLY DIE FROM IT 
SO OPERATED WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU BACK TO A NORMAL LIFESTYLE FOR A LADY OF YOUR AGE 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT 
YES DOCTOR O. K. 
FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING 
EIGHT O'CLOCK 
DON'T BE LATE 
I'LL TRY NOT TO BE ALL RIGHT 
THE GAMELAN FOR TOMORROW IS TO TAKE OUT THE OLD VALVE PUT A NEW 
VALVE IN AND WE'LL SEW IT STRAIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE HEART 
SHE'S A LADY IN HER EIGHTIES AND ESSENTIALLY IT'S BEEN USED FOR 
A LIFE TIME SIXTY TIMES A MINUTE NINETY TIMES A MINUTE AND IT'S WORN OUT 
MURIEL'S FUTURE NOW RESTS IN THE HANDS OF MR. MILNER AND HIS TEAM 
SHE'S FORTUNATE TO BE TREATED IN BLACKPOOL VICTORIA'S CARDIAC UNIT 
A CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE WITH FIVE CUTTING EDGE OPERATING THEATRES 
ATTENDED BY EIGHT SURGEONS INCLUDING MURIEL'S CONSULTANT MR. MILNER 
WE DON'T DO MUCH IN THE WAY OF MINOR SURGERY HERE 
WE DO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED HEART OPERATIONS A YEAR 
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TAKE MAJOR OPERATIONS AND MAKE THEM LESS TRAUMATIC TO THE PATIENT 
THE REALITY IS SOMETIMES THAT MAKES THEM MORE DIFFICULT AND YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT AND WORK WITH THAT 
BUT THESE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY BIG SERIOUS MAJOR OPERATIONS 
REALISTICALLY PEOPLE LIKE MRS. FANCY PUT THEIR LIVES IN OUR HANDS 
WE TAKE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
AT DEATH'S DOOR AND YOU GIVE THEM A SECOND CHANCE AND IT'S FABULOUS BUT IT CAN BE AWFUL 
THE N. H. S. WAS ESTABLISHED SIXTY YEARS AGO TO PROVIDE CARE 
FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE AND THE SAME IS TRUE TODAY 
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BLACKPOOL VICTORIA HOSPITAL STILL FOLLOWS THAT PRINCIPLE 
HELLO OLIVER OOH OOH 
DO YOU NOT WANT TO SIT THERE 
LEADING PAEDIATRIC CONSULTANT NIGEL LAYCOCK HAS 
BEEN CARING FOR BABIES AND CHILDREN AT THE VIC FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT BUT WE'RE NOT HAPPY AT THE MINUTE ARE WE 
BEING A CHILDREN'S DOCTOR ISN'T ALL ABOUT SAVING LIVES 
IT'S JUST AS MUCH ABOUT HELPING CHILDREN AND HELPING FAMILIES 
MOVE FORWARD WITH WHATEVER PROBLEM THERE IS 
BUT TODAY THERE IS DRAMA 
DOCTOR LAYCOCK HAS BEEN CALLED AWAY TO AN EMERGENCY IN INTENSIVE CARE 
PARAMEDICS HAVE RUSHED TWO YEAR OLD LEWIS WATSON INTO A AND AMP E. 
HE WAS HAVING CONVULSIONS THAT LASTED A TERRIFYING FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
IT WAS HIS BROTHER STEPHEN WHO FIRST SPOTTED THE SYMPTOMS 
HE SAID HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S POSSESSED 
HE TURNED ROUND AND THERE YOU ARE HE'S FROTHING AT THE MOUTH 
I PATTED HIM ON THE SHOULDER AND HE TURNED ROUND 
SLOWLY AND LOOKED LIKE HIS WAS POSSESSED SO I RAN TO MY MUM AND SHE GOT HOLD OF HIM 
PUT HIM ON HIS SIDE PILLOWS UNDER HIM ACROSS MY LEGS 
THEN I NOTICED BLOOD WAS COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH 
THAT'S WHEN I PANICKED BECAUSE HE SEEMED TO GO MORE JERKY AND THAT'S WHEN I PHONED THE AMBULANCE 
IT TAKES THE COMBINED EXPERTISE OF SPECIALIST TEAMS ACROSS 
THE HOSPITAL TO STABILISE LEWIS AND HE'S BEEN PUT ON LIFE SUPPORT 
HE'S GOT A TUBE DOWN INTO HIS LUNGS AND THE MACHINE IS TAKING OVER HIS BREATHING 
SO AT THE MOMENT HE'S GOT MEDICINE ON BOARD 
TO KEEP HIM PAIN FREE AND TO KEEP HIM SEDATED 
LEWIS'S CONDITION IS SO SERIOUS THAT HE HAS TO BE TRANSFERRED 
TO A SPECIALIST CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN MANCHESTER 
BUT MOVING HIM IS A RISKY BUSINESS 
WE'RE NOW GOING TO HAVE TO TRANSFER HIM FROM THE TROLLEY 
THAT WE'VE GOT THERE ONTO THE TRANSFER TEAM'S EQUIPMENT AND THEIR 
OWN VENTILATOR AND THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT IN GENERAL WHICH IS ALWAYS A DIFFICULT THING TO DO 
EVERYBODY READY WE'LL GO ACROSS ON LIFT O. K. 
READY STEADY AND LIFT 
THOUGH HE WEIGHS ONLY FIFTEEN KILOS IT TAKES SIX MEDICS TO MOVE LEWIS 
AND HIS ESSENTIAL LIFE LINES ONTO THE AMBULANCE TROLLEY 
HIS FAMILY ARE FINALLY ALLOWED IN TO SEE HIM 
HERE'S YOUR MAN 
DO YOU WANT TO COME ROUND 
IT'S NOT NICE TO SEE HIM LIKE THIS BUT 
I JUST FEEL A BIT SICK I KNOW 
IT'S BEEN TOO MUCH IT'S A SHAME THERE'S A LOT OF WIRES IN HIM 
IT'S THE BABY OF THE HOUSE 
IT REALLY IS A SHAME IT'S UPSETTING 
HE'S TRANSFERRED TO THE AMBULANCE AND THEY'LL BLUE LIGHT HIM OFF TO MANCHESTER 
TAKE HIM DOWN TO AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AND HOPEFULLY HE'LL REMAIN STABLE OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS 
THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE HE'LL START FITTING AGAIN BUT WE'VE GIVEN HIM 
SOME ANTI FITTING MEDICINE WHILE HE'S HERE 
THAT SHOULD MAKE THE CHANCE OF THAT HAPPENING MUCH LESS LIKELY 
LEWIS'S EMERGENCY TRANSFER TO MANCHESTER WILL SEE HIM RECEIVE SPECIALIST MONITORING AND TREATMENT 
DOCTOR LAYCOCK AND HIS TEAM HAVE DONE ALL THEY CAN FOR NOW 
BUT LEWIS IS NOT OUT OF DANGER YET 
ANOTHER OF MR. MILNER'S PATIENTS IS AWAITING SURGERY 
AS A NON SMOKER DENNIS SUTTON DIDN'T GET A SECOND THOUGHT TO HIS PERSISTENT HUSKY VOICE 
HE WAS MISSING ALL THE WARNING SIGNS OF ADVANCED LUNG CANCER 
IT WAS GILL THAT REALLY PESTERED ME TO GO BACK TO THE DOCTOR'S AND MAKE SURE THAT I GOT SOMETHING SORTED OUT 
AND I'M GLAD SHE DID OTHERWISE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO LATE WHEN THEY FOUND IT 
ALL MY FRIENDS THAT 
WE GO OUT WITH ON A FRIDAY NIGHT INTO THE PUB 
THEY ALL SMOKED AND OF COURSE WE WERE SAT THERE WE DON'T SMOKE 
ORIGINALLY THAT'S HOW IT ALL STARTED 
I GOT THE HUSKY VOICE 
AND WE THINK IT WAS THE PASSIVE SMOKING THAT DID IT IN THE PUBS 
I GO FOR THE OPERATION TOMORROW MORNING AND HAVE A COMPLETE RIGHT LUNG TAKEN AWAY 
AND THEN BACK INTO INTENSIVE CARE AND THEN 
ONWARDS AND UPWARDS FROM THERE 
FEELING ALL RIGHT DENNIS DENNIS HAS REMAINED POSITIVE IN THE FACE OF A CONDITION THAT 
WITHOUT MAJOR SURGERY WOULD RAPIDLY TAKE HIS LIFE 
I'M VERY PROUD OF HIM 
I'M PROUD OF HIM FOR THE WAY THAT HE'S ACCEPTED IT 
I'M PROUD OF HIM FOR THE WAY THAT HE'S NEVER EVER ONCE SAID WHY ME 
WHY US OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
HE'S JUST TAKEN IT ON THE CHIN GOT ON WITH IT 
AND IT'S BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE 
DON'T UPSET YOURSELF 
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG NIGHT FOR GILL AND DENNIS BEFORE TOMORROW'S LIFE OR DEATH SURGERY 
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT 
IT'S A TYPICAL NOVEMBER DAY IN OUT OF SEASON BLACKPOOL 
THE SUMMER HOLIDAYMAKERS HAVE HEADED HOME AND BEEN REPLACED BY A DIFFERENT CLIENTELE THE OVER SIXTY FIVES 
BUT THESE MORE GENTEEL VISITORS BRING THEIR OWN CHALLENGES 
THE SEASONAL CALM IS SHATTERED BY THE SOUND OF SIRENS 
PARAMEDIC SUE BUTLER DAVIES IS SPEEDING TO THE AID OF A POSSIBLE STROKE VICTIM 
I'M ON MY WAY INTO NORTH SHORE IN BLACKPOOL AT THE OTHER END 
OF THE PROMENADE TO SOMEBODY WHO'S COLLAPSED ON A BUS 
POSSIBLY A C. V. A. A STROKE 
A TOURIST HAS BEEN TAKEN ILL ON A PENSIONER'S OUTING 
THE LADY'S UPSTAIRS UPSTAIRS 
PARAMEDIC STEVE FULLER ASSESSES THE SITUATION 
JUDITH SMALLEY HAS LOST SENSATION DOWN HER LEFT SIDE AND HER HEART IS RACING AT ONE HUNDRED FORTY BEATS A MINUTE 
CAN YOU MANAGE TO MOVE YOUR LEFT KNEE UP TOWARDS YOUR CHIN 
O. K. HOW ABOUT YOUR RIGHT KNEE 
THAT'S O. K. 
CAN YOU WALK OVER 
YEAH WE'LL TAKE THIS OFF 
JUST TAKE IT OFF FOR A MINUTE ALL RIGHT DARLING RELAX 
IF THIS IS A STROKE THE FIRST HOUR IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL 
SO THE TEAM NEED TO GET JUDITH INTO A AND AMP E. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
CAN YOU MANAGE TO PULL ME AWAY 
O. K. LOVELY IT'S COMING BACK IT'S GOING GOOD FOR YOU 
THE SYMPTOMS COULD BE A WARNING SIGN FOR JUDITH 
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF FURTHER ATTACK AND COMPLICATIONS 
SHE'LL NEED CONSTANT MONITORING 
IT'S NOT JUST HOLIDAYMAKERS WHO TURN TO THE VIC IN A CRISIS 
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND LOCALS RELY ON THE HOSPITAL FOR THEIR CARE WHEN THINGS GO WRONG 
AT THE CHILDREN'S UNIT DOCTOR LAYCOCK IS HEADING TO SEE ONE OF BLACKPOOL'S YOUNGEST RESIDENTS 
HOW ARE WE GETTING ON ALL RIGHT 
A TEN WEEK OLD BABY HAS ARRIVED FOLLOWING AN EMERGENCY REFERRAL BY HIS LOCAL G. P. 
IT'S JUST HIS BREATHING REALLY BECAUSE HE'S JUST GRUNTING AFTER EACH BREATH 
HE'S DOING THAT ALL THE TIME HE'S NOT BEEN FEEDING PROPERLY 
NORMALLY HE'S UP AND AWAKE AND SMILING AND AT THE MOMENT 
HE'S NOT HE'S JUST DEAD LETHARGIC AND SLEEPING ALL THE TIME 
YOU JUST WANT HIM TO GET BETTER 
HE FEELS LIKE HE'S GOING TO GET WARM AGAIN 
KYLE'S TEN WEEKS OF AGE AND HE'S HAD A TOUGH TIME 
HE'S BEEN IN BEFORE WITH SOME LITTLE SEIZURE EPISODES 
THIS AFTERNOON HE STARTED GRUNTING WHICH MEANS HE HAD A LITTLE 
TO HIS BREATHING SORT OF A BREATHING OUT NOISE 
DOCTOR LAYCOCK SUSPECTS A URINE INFECTION 
IN ITSELF CAUSE FOR CONCERN IN ONE SO YOUNG 
BUT LITTLE KYLE COULD BE SUFFERING FROM SOMETHING MUCH MORE SERIOUS 
DOCTOR LAYCOCK ORDERS TESTS FOR MENINGITIS A LIFE THREATENING CONDITION 
I THINK IT'S GRUESOME FOR THE PARENTS 
THEY'VE HAD A COUPLE OF NIGHTS LACK OF SLEEP AND WORRY AND THIS 
LITTLE BABY HAS HAD ONE OR TWO PROBLEMS IN HIS TEN WEEK LIFE SO FAR SO IT'S A TOUGH TIME FOR PARENTS 
AS SOON AS MENINGITIS IS MENTIONED EVERY PARENT FEARS THE WORST 
KYLE'S MUM AND DAD WILL NOW HAVE TO WAIT TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO SEE IF THEIR WORST FEARS ARE REALISED 
SUSPECTED STROKE VICTIM JUDITH SMALLEY WAS RUSHED IN BY PARAMEDICS AFTER COLLAPSING ON A BUS 
SHE'S WAITING ANXIOUSLY IN BLACKPOOL VICTORIA'S A AND AMP E. DEPARTMENT TO FIND OUT IF SHE CAN GO HOME 
GOOD DAY HOW ARE YOU 
ALL RIGHT YEAH I'M ALL RIGHT I'M SURE I AM 
MUCH BETTER YEAH O. K. GOOD 
HAVING ASSESSED HIS PATIENT THE DOCTOR IS UNWILLING TO LET JUDITH GO HOME JUST YET 
TODAY YOU'VE GOT A VERY FAST IRREGULAR HEART RATE AND YOU WERE 
A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED THIS MORNING WITH SLURRED SPEECH SO THAT SOUNDS LIKE A T. R. A. A TRANSIT SCHEMIC ATTACK 
BASICALLY A MINI STROKE A SMALL CLOT TO THE BRAIN WHICH HAS NOW RESOLVED ALL RIGHT 
ONE IN TWENTY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED A MINI STROKE WILL GO ON TO HAVE A FULL STROKE WITHIN TWO DAYS 
SEAN IS ADAMANT THAT JUDITH BE ADMITTED IMMEDIATELY TO THE MEDICAL WARD FOR TREATMENT 
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME 
I'M NOT KEEN I FEEL BETTER NOW I THINK I'LL GO HOME 
NO I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD REALLY 
THAT'S UP TO YOU BUT THIS HOSPITAL'S BUSY AND WE WOULDN'T 
ADMIT PEOPLE IF WE DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO I ASSURE YOU 
SO MY MEDICAL ADVICE HONESTLY IS THAT YOU SHOULD STAY 
THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS WILL BE CRITICAL FOR JUDITH SO DESPITE HER 
RELUCTANCE BLACKPOOL'S MEDICS WILL BE KEEPING A VERY CLOSE EYE ON HER 
AS NIGHT FALLS ON BLACKPOOL VIC THE WORK 
GOES ON 
MARY BIRD AND HER CRACK CLEANING TEAM CONTINUE THEIR TWENTY FOUR HOUR BATTLE WITH THE SUPERBUGS 
IT'S A MASSIVE JOB 
THEATRES WARDS DEPARTMENTS RESIDENCES OFFICES GROUNDS 
WE CLEAN EVERYWHERE 
A RECENT FIFTY MILLION INVESTMENT IN INFECTION CONTROL HIGHLIGHTS WHAT A SERIOUS ISSUE IT IS 
NO ONE IN THE N. H. S. CAN IGNORE IT 
I FEEL THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE SHOULD DO TO COMBAT MRSA WITH OUR CLEANING TECHNIQUES STAFF 
TRAINING AND ALSO TO CHALLENGE PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE HAVE YOU WASHED YOUR HANDS 
THIS THEATRE HOSTS MAJOR OPERATIONS 
IT'S FULL OF SPECIALIST EQUIPMENT THAT CAN HARBOUR INFECTIOUS BUGS SO LIKE ALL EIGHTEEN THEATRES AT THE VIC 
IT GETS A DEEP CLEAN EVERY OPERATING DAY 
VERY CLEAN 
VERY THOROUGH EXCELLENT GIRLS 
IT'S EIGHT HUNDRED A M. 
AND EIGHTY THREE YEAR OLD MURIEL FANCY'S SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON THE NEXT FEW HOURS 
SHE'S ABOUT TO UNDERGO COMPLEX HEART SURGERY 
UNTIL RECENTLY MURIEL WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED FOR THIS OPERATION SIMPLY BECAUSE OF HER AGE 
TWENTY YEARS AGO IN A SETTING I WOULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE SEEN HER 
QUITE POSSIBLY THE CARDIOLOGIST WHO REFERRED HER TO ME WOULD HAVE 
NEVER HAVE SEEN HER AND SHE'S HAVE BEEN MANAGED MEDICALLY IN GENERAL PRACTICE 
MR. MILNER IS ALL TOO AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF OPERATING ON A LADY AS FRAIL AS MURIEL 
WE'RE ENTERING A PERIOD OF RISK MATHEMATICALLY A ONE IN TWENTY CHANCE OF DEATH STROKE OR MAJOR COMPLICATION 
AND IN THIS BUSINESS YOU HAVE TO DEAL IN REAL CHANCES 
IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO SAY SHE'LL BE FINE 
BUT AT THIS STAGE I'M GOING TO SAY I HOPE SHE'LL BE FINE 
WE LIVE WITHIN THE PROBABILITIES 
MURIEL'S CHEST IS SAWN OPEN BY MR. MILNER SO HE CAN SEE HER HEART 
I'M JUST OPENING UP A SMALL SPACE HERE 
THAT SHOULD 
FUNNEL ME STRAIGHT DOWN ONTO THE AORTIC VALVE 
SO THIS IS THE AORTIC VALVE WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE OUT THE VALVE 
WILL BE REPLACED WITH ONE THAT ORIGINATES FROM A PIG 
THE ALTERNATIVE A MECHANICAL VALVE WOULD NECESSITATE MURIEL TAKING 
BLOOD THINNING DRUGS FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE 
SCISSORS PLEASE 
AFTER TWO AND HALF HOURS THE OPERATION REACHES A CRITICAL PHASE 
MR. MILNER IS PAINSTAKINGLY SEWING THE NEW VALVE INTO MURIEL'S HEART 
JUST FOLLOW THE STICK 
AFTER NEARLY FOUR HOURS IN THE OPERATING THEATRE 
MURIEL HAS HER NEW VALVE BUT SHE'S NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET 
I THINK THIS IS IN SOME WAYS WHEN I GET MOST NERVOUS BECAUSE 
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE'RE COMING OUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE SHE WAKES UP DOESN'T BLEED 
IT'S PROBABLY PRE ORDAINED BY WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE HOURS 
SO YEAH I THINK IT'S PROBABLY THE TIME 
I WORRY MORE THAN I DID BEFOREHAND 
AT THE HEART OF THE HOSPITAL IS THE ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT 
IT'S OPEN ROUND THE CLOCK TREATING NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS A YEAR AND SEES ITS FAIR SHARE OF DRAMA 
BUT NOT EVERY MINUTE IS FILLED WITH TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS AND KNIFINGS 
SOMETIMES IT'S JUST PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD A BAD DAY 
WE WERE JUST GOING FOR A CUP OF TEA WEREN'T WE 
SEVENTY NINE YEAR OLD HOLIDAYMAKERS CONNIE AND MARION HAVE ENDED UP IN CASUALTY 
AFTER A GUST OF WIND CAUGHT CONNIE OFF BALANCE ON THE PROM 
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE NOW 
WHAT'S HAPPENED 
MRS. GARROD 
ON DUTY IS A AND AMP E. CONSULTANT NIGEL KIDNER 
IT'S A FAMILIAR CASE FOR HIM AND HE QUICKLY GETS TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM 
THAT FOOT DOESN'T LOOK AS IF IT'S POINTING THE RIGHT WAY DOES IT 
GENTLY ROLL THIS LEG 
THAT SORE YES 
O. K. 
I STRONGLY SUSPECT THERE MAY WELL BE A BREAK IN YOUR HIP BUT WE'LL CHECK THAT WITH AN X. RAY 
YEAH JUST WALKING ALONG AND THEN SUDDENLY THIS WIND CAME AND BLEW HER OVER 
IN EXAMINATION ROOM TWO THE DOCTOR IS TREATING JAMES MCCLUSKY'S BURNS 
AN EXPLODING CHIP PAN BLEW BOILING FAT ONTO HIS ARM AND FACE 
THERE'S QUITE LARGE BLISTERING PRESENT 
AND THAT'S INDICATIVE OF PARTIAL THICKNESS BURNS GONE AT LEAST HALFWAY THROUGH THE SKIN 
OVER TWO AND HALF MILLION PEOPLE NATIONWIDE ARE TREATED IN A AND AMP E. DUE TO HOUSEHOLD ACCIDENTS EVERY YEAR 
AT LEAST THIS ONE IS GOING TO IMPROVE JAMES'S DIET 
I WON'T BE HAVING CHIPS ANY MORE OVEN CHIPS 
A AND AMP E. MR. KIDNER 
IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM MR. KIDNER BOOKS AN X. RAY FOR CONNIE'S SUSPECTED FRACTURED HIP 
I'VE GOT A LADY OF NINETY PLUS WITH A FRACTURED NECK OF FEMUR FOR YOU 
O. K. CHEERS BYE BYE 
THEY GIVE YOU SOME TABLETS TO KILL THE PAIN DIDN'T THEY YEAH 
CONNIE'S OFF TO X. RAY THE DOCTOR HAS HAD ANOTHER CASE DROPPED ON HIM 
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED LIKE AN IDIOT I FELL OFF A LADDER 
STEPHEN HOWARTH HAS ENDED UP WITH A NASTY GASH 
SMALL INJECTION MAKE IT NICE AND NEAT 
IT'LL BE NEAT DON'T WORRY 
TO ADD TO THE BUMP TO HIS HEAD IS THE DENT TO HIS PRIDE 
IT'S ALL RIGHT IT DOESN'T HURT OR ANYTHING 
BUT I FEEL A BIT STUPID FALLING OFF A LADDER LIKE YOU WOULD DO 
TWENTY MINUTES AFTER MR. KIDNER SENT HIS PATIENT TO X. RAY AND HER RESULTS ARE BACK 
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S BEEN MORE THAN JUST A BAD DAY FOR CONNIE 
WELL THAT CONFIRMS WHAT WE THOUGHT 
THERE'S THE BREAK THROUGH THE NECK OF THE FEMUR 
MRS. GARROD 
THE X. RAY DOES SHOW A FRACTURE THERE OH YEAH 
O. K. WE'LL SPEAK TO THE BONE DOCTORS THE ORTHOPAEDIC DOCTORS AND THEY'LL COME AND TALK TO YOU 
IT'S GOING TO NEED AN OPERATION TO FIX 
CONNIE WILL NOW BE MOVED TO THE ORTHOPAEDIC UNIT TO AWAIT A VITAL HIP OPERATION 
ON THE CHILDREN'S WARD KYLE'S MUM AND DAD HAVE HAD TO ENDURE AN AGONISING WAIT 
THEIR TEN WEEK OLD BABY IS FIGHTING AN INFECTION THAT HAS LEFT HIM GRAVELY ILL 
HE'S HAD TO UNDERGO A SERIES OF TESTS THE MOST SERIOUS OF WHICH IS FOR MENINGITIS 
TWENTY FOUR HOURS LATER AND DOCTOR LAYCOCK HAS THE RESULTS 
WHEN THEY'VE DONE THE LITTLE SAMPLE OF FLUID FROM THE BACK AND LOOKED UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 
IT ACTUALLY LOOKED O. K. THERE AREN'T LOTS 
OF WHITE CELLS FIGHTING INFECTION IN THERE FOR SIGNS OF MENINGITIS 
SO WITH A BIT OF LUCK IT HAS BEEN A WEE INFECTION 
STAYING IN THE WEE SYSTEM AND IT'S NOT GOT TO OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY 
SO HOPEFULLY IT'S BEEN CAUGHT IN TIME 
BUT KYLE IS STILL A VERY ILL BABY 
DOCTOR LAYCOCK DECIDES THAT FURTHER TESTS ARE REQUIRED TO SEE IF KYLE'S KIDNEYS ARE WORKING PROPERLY 
A DYE IS INJECTED INTO THE BABY WHICH ALLOWS THIS SCANNER 
TO PRODUCE A MORE DETAILED IMAGE OF KYLE'S KIDNEY FUNCTION 
THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING ON ISN'T THERE 
ANOMALIES HERE COULD RESULT IN MONTHS OF FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND TREATMENT FOR KYLE 
THE CARDIAC CENTRE IS ABOUT TO SEE ANOTHER LIFE CHANGING OPERATION 
SO WE'VE GOT DENNIS SUTTON YES 
DENNIS IS BEING PREPARED FOR THEATRE 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING THIS MORNING FINE 
ALL SET YEAH I AM 
HE'S SUFFERING FROM AN AGGRESSIVE FORM OF LUNG CANCER CAUSED BY PASSIVE SMOKING 
HIS RIGHT LUNG MUST BE REMOVED 
HIS SURGEON IS CARDIOTHORACIC CONSULTANT RUSSELL MILNER 
WE'RE LOOKING AT A RIGHT PNEUMECTOMY WHICH IS BASICALLY TAKING OUT HIS RIGHT LUNG 
THE ONLY REASON FOR DOING THIS OPERATION IS TO TRY AND CURE HIM OF HIS LUNG CANCER 
AND THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY HIS ONLY PROSPECT FOR CURE 
THE NEXT THREE HOURS WILL CHANGE HIS LIFE 
SUCCESS NOW GIVES HIM A GOOD CHANCE OF LONG TERM SURVIVAL 
FAILURE TO GET HIS LUNG OUT MEANS HE WILL DIE FROM HIS LUNG CANCER WITHIN THE NEXT 
TWO OR THREE YEARS AT A GUESS 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS DURING THE OPERATION MAY MEAN HE DIES WITHOUT LEAVING HOSPITAL 
THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT 
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING UP THERE IS THE SHADOWING CAUSED BY THE TUMOUR IN HIS LUNG 
THAT'S TAKING OUT A QUARTER OF THE OVERALL DISTANCE FROM ONE SIDE OF THE CHEST TO THE OTHER 
IN ORDER TO REMOVE SUCH A LARGE TUMOUR MR. MILNER IS FORCED TO PERFORM A HIGHLY INVASIVE PROCEDURE 
IT'S A CRITICAL TIME FOR DENNIS 
HIS CANCEROUS LUNG IS COLLAPSED FOR SURGERY PUTTING A MASSIVE STRAIN ON THE OTHER 
LUNG FORCEPS 
AFTER THREE HOURS OF PAINSTAKING SURGERY MR. MILNER IS FINALLY ABLE TO REMOVE DENNIS'S DISEASED LUNG 
THE WHOLE OF THIS HALF HERE IS ALL TUMOUR 
IT'S ALL CANCER 
MR. MILNER'S SKILL AND EXPERIENCE HAS JUST GIVEN DENNIS HIS ONLY CHANCE OF SURVIVAL 
BUT EVEN SO HE'S TROUBLED BY THE TRAUMA HE'S PUT HIM THROUGH 
THAT'S A VERY DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION I DON'T REALLY 
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE VERY 
NICE OPERATIONS TO HAVE TO DO 
REALISTICALLY IF HE'S HOME MOBILE WITHOUT COMPLICATIONS 
AND WELL IN THREE MONTHS' TIME HE'S PROBABLY OUT OF MOST OF THE WOODS 
BUT THERE CAN ALWAYS BE A TREE STUMP TO TRIP YOU UP 
EVEN REMOTELY DOWN THE LINE 
THE NEXT PHASE OF RECUPERATION AND THERAPY IS 
AS CRUCIAL TO DENNIS AS HIS BODY BEGINS TO ADAPT TO LOSING A LUNG 
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE 
FOR HIM AND HIS PARTNER GILL THERE ARE STILL DIFFICULT TIMES TO COME 
BABY KYLE HAS BEEN THROUGH TOUGH TIMES TOO AND HIS MUM LAURA 
IS WAITING FOR HIS FINAL TEST RESULTS 
IT'S LOOK A SATISFACTORY SCAN 
IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR MUM AND KYLE WE'VE GOT A NORMAL SCAN 
BOTH SIDES ARE WORKING EQUALLY WELL SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THE WAY THINGS HAVE GONE 
YOU JUST WANT A BOTTLE DON'T YOU WHEN YOU'RE TIRED 
A POWERFUL COURSE OF ANTI BIOTICS HAS STARTED TO DEFEAT BABY KYLE'S URINE INFECTION 
HE'S A LOT BETTER IN HIMSELF YEAH 
WIDE AWAKE HE'S STAYING AWAKE FOR LONGER AND HE'S FEEDING BETTER 
SO A LOT OF SMILES 
A LOT OF GARGLING 
HE WAS PRETTY SICK WHEN HE CAME IN 
WE WERE CONCERNED WHETHER HE'D JUST GOT A URINE INFECTION WHETHER IT WAS MENINGITIS AS WELL 
HE'S COMPLETELY BACK TO NORMAL NOW 
HE'S FEEDING REALLY WELL HE'S RESPONDING NICELY TO MUM AND SO IT'S ALL GOOD NEWS REALLY 
IT'S EIGHT DAYS SINCE MR. MILNER PERFORMED HEART SURGERY ON MURIEL FANCY 
SHE'S READY TO LEAVE BLACKPOOL VICTORIA AND HER CONSULTANT IS VERY CONFIDENT IN HER PROGRESS 
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN AWAY WHAT IS A POTENTIAL CAUSE OF DEATH FOR HER 
SHE'S GOT A BETTER LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN HER FRIENDS OF THE SAME AGE 
I'M NOT BIONIC AT ALL 
BUT WE'LL SEE HOW I GO ON PHYSICALLY WHEN I GET HOME WHEN I CAN LET MYSELF GO 
I DAREN'T RUN DOWN HERE BECAUSE THESE NURSES WILL COME 
AND SLAP MY HAND 
I'VE GOT MY PIG'S TISSUE IN 
BUT I HAVEN'T STARTED GRUNTING YET 
BYE BYE EVERYBODY THANK YOU 
I'VE BEEN TOLD I'LL HAVE TO TAKE IT EASY AND EASY I SHALL TAKE IT 
ANOTHER SUCCESS STORY FOR THE MEDICS OF BLACKPOOL VICTORIA 
BABY LEWIS IS STILL BEING CLOSELY MONITORED BY DOCTOR LAYCOCK 
BUT HE'S NOW BACK AT HOME PLAYING WITH HIS FAMILY 
CONNIE HAS HAD A HIP REPLACEMENT AND WILL BE TAKING MORE CARE ON WINDY PROMENADES IN THE FUTURE 
AND DENNIS IS SLOWLY RECUPERATING AT HOME ADAPTING TO LIFE WITH ONLY ONE LUNG 
IF I HADN'T GOT GILL I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL I'D HAVE DONE 
WITHOUT GILL'S LOVE AND AFFECTION I MAY NOT HAVE PULLED THROUGH 
IT'S THE END OF A NORMAL DAY AT BLACKPOOL VICTORIA 
AN ORDINARY HOSPITAL DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS 
FROM THE DEMANDS ON RESOURCES OF AN AGEING POPULATION 
TO THE CONTINUING BATTLE AGAINST THE SUPERBUGS THE FUTURE HOLDS 
MANY CHALLENGES FOR THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
FOR BLACKPOOL MEDICS LIFE GOES ON AS THEY CONTINUE TO SERVE AT THE HEART OF THEIR COMMUNITY
