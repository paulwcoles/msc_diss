THE REIGNING WORLD CHAMPION JOHN 
HIGGINS 
HE IS ONE OF THE DOCTORS HIGGINS WANT I COULD HAVE POLLED ONE OF 
THE TOUGHEST HE HAD A CHANCE WITH 
THE RED THAT HE MISSED AND I 
MANAGED TO GET IN AND MAKE THE 
BREAK L. MISSED A COUPLE BUT APART 
FROM THAT I PLAYED REALLY WELL 
WHAT A PERFORMANCE FROM JOHN 
HIGGINS HE GOES THROUGH TO THE 
NEXT FRAME 
HELLO FROM THE CRUCIBLE EARLIER 
TONIGHT IT WAS TIED FOR JOHN 
HIGGINS DID TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO 
A SECOND ROUND MATCH HE KNEW HE 
WOULD HAVE TO BE AT HIS BEST 
EVERYONE WANTS TO BEAT WORLD CHAMPION 
IF IT WAS NOT FOR MUM AND CHAMPION DAD AND THEY GAVE UP A LOT OF TIME 
AND MONEY MY DAD WOULD WORK FIVE 
OR SIX DAYS A WEEK AT THE WORLD 
BREAKS AND THEN AT THE WEEKEND HE 
TOOK HIS BOY SAID TO TRY AND DO 
SOMETHING IN SNOOKER HIS BOYS 
OUT STEVE DAVIS WAS ALWAYS MY 
SNOOKER HERO L. ALWAYS REMEMBER THE 
FINAL AGAINST DENIS TAYLOR IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
WHEN DENNIS TAYLOR POTTED THE FINAL 
BLACK I WAS CRYING AT THE END OF 
THE CAGE IT IS JUST TO TURBINE 
NATION THAT SEPARATE REALLY GOOD 
PLAYERS FROM TOURNAMENT WINNERS ON 
A REGULAR BASIS 
HIS OPPONENT IS 
WORLD NUMBER SIXTEEN RYAN DAY A PLAYER 
WHO HAS BEEN MAKING GREAT STRIDES 
UP THE WORLD RANKINGS IT WAS THE 
WORLD NUMBER ONE HE RATTLED OFF THE 
FIRST THREE FRAMES ACTION FROM 
EARLY IN FRAME FOUR COMMENTARY BY 
STEVE DAVIS AND CLIVE EVERTON 
JOHN HIGGINS HAS 
GONE IN OFF FROM THE SAFETY BY AN 
DAY HAS POTTED A LONG RED RYAN 
DAY 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE HAD A CHANCE DAY AFTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MESSED IT UP THROUGH HIS 
CUE ON THE TABLE AND WALKED OUT OF 
THE ROOM L. E. A SHEEN I ASSUME 
THAT ANTHONY HAMILTON HAD GIVEN UP 
THE FRAME BY THAT POINT BUT HAD HE 
NOT WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN THE FRAME 
LOST IT IS NOT A NICE START FOR 
RYAN DAY RYAN DAY HAS MISSED BALLS THIS 
EVENING THAT HE NEVER MISSES 
IT IS 
A LONG MATCH AND WITH THREE 
SESSIONS BUT YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO 
LET A PLAYER OF JOHN HIGGINS 
STANDARD GET OUT OF YOUR SIGHTS 
THE ONLY SAVING GRACE WOULD BE THAT 
THE I. S. M. INTERVAL COMING A CHANCE 
TO REGROUP THERE IS AN INTERVAL 
COMING 
UNTIL YOU GET YOUR FIRST FRAME ON 
THE BOARD YOU'RE NEVER SETTLED 
DOWN IN A MATCH 
HE DID NOT WANT BEAT THAT NEAR THAT 
CUSHION DID NOT WANT TO BE THAT 
HERE 
A GREAT EFFORT TO SPLIT THE PACK 
OPEN IT WAS NEVER GOING TO BE EASY 
HIGGINS HAS NOT MISSED ANYTHING OF 
NOTE YET 
I WAS TALKING TO SHAUN JUST BEFORE 
HE WENT OUT AND WAS ASKING HIM 
WHETHER HE WENT HOME BETWEEN HIS 
MATCHES AND HE SAID HE HAD BEEN AT 
THE ACADEMY DOING SOME PRACTICE 
WITH LIANG WENBO HE SAID THAT 
LIANG WENBO WAS PLAYING SOME 
FANTASTIC STUFF 
THIS IS A VERY DELICATE JOB FOR THE 
REFEREE HE DECIDES IN THE END THAT 
THE PINK WILL NOT GO BETWEEN THE 
TWO REDS 
I BET HIS FRONT LIVING 
ROOM IS PERFECT DOCKED AT CHAIR 
OUT OF PLACE NOT A CHAIR OUT OF 
PLACE 
HIGGINS INTENT ON MAKING IT FOUR TO ZERO AT 
HIS DOES IT AT THIS VISIT 
BUT FOR THE KISS HE WOULD HAVE HAD 
A DIFFERENT ANGLE ON THE BLACK AM ASSUMING HE PLAYED THE KISS 
JOHN HIGGINS WAS AT ONE STAGE FIFTY SIX 
FAVOURITE FOR THIS EVENT FIFTH OR 
SIXTH FAVOURITE 
THOSE ODDS IN PLUS 
BY THAT AT THAT HE HAS NOT REACHED 
THE SEMI FINAL IN THE SIX PREVIOUS 
RANKING EVENTS INFLUENCED 
JOHN WILL BE DELIGHTED WITH THIS 
FIRST SESSION HIS OPPONENT WILL BE 
RUSHING TO THE PRACTICE TABLE IN 
THE BREAK JUST TO GET HIS HAND IN 
HIGGINS HAS POTTED NINETY SEVEN PER CENT OF THE 
BALLS BUT HE HAS POTTED THAT HE 
HAS POTTED 
WITH THAT BREAK OF SEVENTY NINE JOHN HIGGINS 
HAS MADE THE BEST OF STARTS AND 
LEAD RYAN DAY BY FOUR TO ZERO AT THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL 
A TERRIBLE START FOUGHT RYAN DAY 
AND HE IS JOHN HIGGINS TRIED TO 
TURN THIS GROUP IN FRAME FIVE 
THE PINK BUS NOT BE TOUCHING THE 
RED ACCORDING TO IN THE RULES 
MUST NOT BE TOUCHING 
HE HAS AND HIT THAT OR WAS IT A 
BAD CONTACT UNDERHIT A SHAKE OF 
THE HEAD AND THE CLEAN OF THE BALL 
BY THE REFEREE THE BACK SPIN THAT 
WAS PUT ON THE WHITE BALL 
TRANSFERRING TO A BIT OF TOP SPIN 
ON THE RED 
HIGGINS REALISED THAT IF HE GOT IT 
DEED CUE BALL WAS COMING BACK FOR 
POSITION ON THE BLUE BUT HE HAS 
LEFT AN EASY STARTER FOR RYAN DAY 
WHO BADLY NEEDS TO GET HIS ACT 
TOGETHER 
THE CUE BALL FOR OPENING UP THIS 
BREAK INTO FRAME WINNING THIS IT 
IS THE RED TO THE LEFT OF THE BLACK 
BUT HOW YOU GET ON THAT IS ANOTHER 
MATTER 
PROBABLY HAVING TO KNOCK A FEW 
OTHER REDS OUT OF THE WAY FIRST 
THIS OPENS UP THE BLACK INTO ONE OF 
THE CORNER POCKETS 
A FRAME WINNING VISIT HERE WOULD BE 
EXCELLENT THE NOT JUST FOR THE 
SCORE BUT FOR HIS CONFIDENCE 
ANOTHER BAD CONTACT WITH THE PACE 
TAKEN OF THE CUE BALL 
ON THE RED BUT STILL NOT REALLY 
NICE 
IT HE CHOOSES 
TO POT THE RED NICE TO THE RIGHT HE MADE NUDGED THAT SECOND RED TOWARDS THE BLACK HAVE AS IT IS A RECESSION BATCH FOLLOWING AND 
HE JUST CANNOT GET THE RIGHT SIDE 
OF THE BLUE THE SNOOKER PLAYER'S 
NIGHT BUT NIGHTMARE 
HE HAS TO CRAWL THROUGH AND TAKE 
THEM LONGER RED 
THE LOWEST RED IS THE EASIEST ONE 
TO GET ON BUT HE COULD ALSO GET ON 
THE ONE ABOVE IT 
HAS HE LEFT HIMSELF IN A BIT OF A 
TRUCK POSITIONALLY 
RED AND BLACK HERE WOULD BE ENOUGH 
HE WOULD TO LIGHT GET POSITION ON 
THIS LAST RED TO SEAL THE FRAME 
A SMALL DOOR OPENING FOR JOHN 
HIGGINS BUT A GREAT SAFETY SHOT 
A SALVAGE OPERATION WAS UNDER WAY 
WHO CAN TAKE CONTROL OF THIS FRAME 
PUT MARK WILL SAFETY BE THE 
ORDER OF THE DAY ANOTHER CHANCE 
FOR JOHN HIGGINS A SHOT TO NOTHING 
COMING UP 
HE PLAYED THE SAFETY TO 
DEVELOP THE BLACK HE HAS NOT LEFT 
ALL THE REDS SAFE THAT IS TO HIS DISADVANTAGE AS WELL 
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE AMOUNT OF TIME 
RYAN IS TAKING HE HAS GOT A 
HEADACHE 
THAT WAS A CLEVER SHOT HE HIT IT 
TOO WELL IT IS NOT SUCH A CLEVER 
SHOT YOU CANNOT EXPECT TO HIT AS 
WELL AS THAT OH DEAR 
IT WAS 
MEANT TO BE A RICOCHET BACK TO THE 
BAULK CUSHION IT HAS TRAVELLED TWO 
LENGTHS OF THE TABLE ALL IS NOT LOST 
THE BLUE AND BLACK ARE OUT OF 
COMMISSION THAT IS WHY HIGGINS 
TRIED TO DEVELOP THE PINK 
IT LOOKS 
LIKE HE HAS A CHANCE FOR A BACK AT 
SHOT BACK UP SHOT 
THAT IS A GREAT SHOT IT IS AS GOOD 
AS YOU CAN GET HE DESERVED NOT TO 
GO IN OFF 
SINCE IT HAS NOT COME UP 
THIS LONG RED IS NOT A CERTAINTY 
FOR HIGGINS HAS NOT THIS LONG 
RED THAT WAS VERY NICELY CUED 
IT IS EVEN WORSE 
FOUL JOHN HIGGINS OF ONE 
THAT WAS VERY WELL CONTROLLED HE 
PLAYED POSITION ON HIGH OVER THE 
BLUE OR THE BLACK IF HE WANTED EITHER 
HERE IS THE SHOT THAT OPENS THE 
FRAME UP 
HE MUST POT THE RED HE IS BOUND TO BE ON THE YELLOW IF NOTHING ELSE 
MARVELLOUSLY PLAYED THERE WAS 
PRESSURE ON THAT ONE YOU WOULD 
LOOK A BIT OF A FAULT IF HE TOOK A 
HARDER RED AND REFUSED AN EASIER 
ONE AND MISSED IT A FOOL 
IF HE MINDS HIS WORK HE SHOULD 
BEAT OVER THE LINE 
BE 
NOT THE BEST 
ANY TIME YOU 
BE NOT THE BEST ANY TIME YOU GET A BAD CONTACT ONCE AGAIN THE 
CUE BALL HAS JUMPED OFF THE TABLE 
THAT WAS PERFECTLY IN THE MIDDLE 
IT WAS A GOOD RECOVERY JUST YELLOW REQUIRED IT IS NOT A REASON TO PUT THE FRAME BEYOND DOUBT 
SHOULD ANYONE BE AT HOME WATCHING 
RYAN DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME OR 
ANYONE AT THE CRUCIBLE THEY ARE 
STARTING TO SEE WHY HE IS SO FEARED 
IN THE GAME HE HAS A VERY STRONG 
CUE ACTION HE HITS THE BALL VERY 
POSITIVELY HE HAS A GOOD MANNERISM 
AROUND THE TABLE HE IS DESTINED TO 
GO PLACES HOPEFULLY FOR HIM 
KNOCK BACK TO WALES TO SEEN NOT 
RYAN DAY HAS REDUCED HIS ARREARS TO 
FOUR TO TWO ON TO FRAME SEVEN JOHN 
HIGGINS IS TWELVE POINT UP POINTS 
NEVER AS EASY AS IT LOOKS THERE IS 
OBVIOUS POTENTIAL FOR A FRAME 
WINNING BREAK 
HE DID NOT WANT TO HAVE TO PLAY THE 
RED ON THAT SHOT BUT HE STRUCK IT 
WELL 
YOU HAVE GOT TO BELIEVE THERE BEAT 
ONLY WAY THIS IS NOT CONVERTED INTO 
A FRAME WINNING BREAK IS SOME SORT 
OF RUBBISH POSITIONAL SHOT JOHN 
HIGGINS IS NOT IN THE HABIT OF 
MAKING TOO MANY OF THOSE 
I AM GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF BUT 
THIS WITH GREAT SIGNIFICANCE LAST 
FRAME OF THE SESSION THIS WOULD 
PUT 
RYAN DAY HAS STRUGGLED TO OVERCOME 
HIS DREADFUL START IN PART HE HAS 
DONE SO IF HE GOES FOUR NUMBER MACRO 
FRAMES BEHIND AGAIN FOUR FRAMES 
BEHIND AGAIN THEN THAT WOULD BE 
SOMETHING OF A CALAMITY AS WAS 
THAT FAILED BLACK FROM THE SPOT BY 
JOHN HIGGINS IT WAS NOT A RUBBISH 
POSITIONAL SHOT IT WAS IN RUBBISH 
SHOT WHICH BROUGHT THE EFFORT TO 
RATE CLOSE 
HIGH KNEW I WAS GETTING 
AHEAD OF MYSELF A CLOSE 
HE STRUCK THAT WELL ENOUGH TO GET 
THE CUE BALL OUT INTO THE OPEN PLAY 
HE HIT THAT BADLY HE WILL BE VERY 
UNHAPPY WITH THAT FROM AN IDEAL 
POSITION TO BE A RUBBISH ONE TO 
A RUBBISH ONE 
HE IS FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THIS 
THAT IT IS A MISS A BALL RED INTO 
THE MIDDLE HE HAS GOT TO HIT THIS 
HARDER THAN HE WOULD NORMALLY WANT 
THAT WAS VERY WELL STRUCK INDEED 
THAT IS A CONFIDENCE BUILDER IF 
EVER THERE WAS ONE WHAT HE STEAL 
THIS WOULD BE 
AFTER HIGGINS BEING 
SIXTY ONE IN FRONT HE IS WOMEN THREE POTS 
OF CLINCHING A FIVE TOOTH LEAD HE 
WAS IN THEN HE MISSED AN 
ELEMENTARY SHOT HOLDING THE PINK 
SPOT BUT NOT REALLY THAT WELL 
I ISSUE HE WANTED TO HOLD THE PINK 
SPOT ASSUME 
HE NEEDS TO STROKE IT IN PLAIN BALL 
IF HE TRIES TO STUN IT IT IS 
PERMISSIBLE MISSABLE 
STILL A BIT TO DO IT AS HE IS THE 
WRONG SIDE OF THE BLUE 
IF HE WERE 
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BLUE IT 
WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM HE HAS GOT 
TO MANUFACTURE A POSITIONAL SHOT 
NO SIDE SPIN REQUIRED HE HAD A BIT 
OF SIDE SPIN ON AND HE LOST 
POSITION 
IF YOU KEEP LEAVING YOURSELF MISS A 
BALL BALLS THEN EVENTUALLY YOU 
WILL MISS ONE 
THE WAY HE PLAYED 
THAT WAS AT LEMMING PACE SO TO 
SPEAK 
HE DID NOT GIVE HIMSELF A CHANCE IF 
HE MISSED IT TO CLEAR THE ROAD FROM 
THE POCKET RED THAT WENT SAFELY IN 
BARRING TWO SNOOKER'S THEY SHOULD 
NOT HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO PLAY FOR THEM RYAN DAY HE 
WON THE LAST FRAME OF THE SESSION 
AND JOHN HIGGINS IS FIVE TO THREE 
WORLD CHAMPION RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
PRODUCED EIGHT TENT FIVE WIN THE SEVENTEEN 
YEAR OLD FROM CHINA IS MAKING HIS 
DEBUT A TEN TO FIVE 
I HAVE MADE ONE OR TWO ALTERATIONS 
TO MY GAME I'M NOT FLYING AS MUCH 
AS I USED TO THERE IS MORE OF A 
MIDDLE GROUND IT STOPS ANXIETY L. 
M. NOT PRODUCING I WAS NOT 
PRODUCING THE LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE 
I WAS CAPABLE OF YOU HAVE TO KEEP 
SEARCHING YOU NEVER STOP LEARNING 
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS NOT RIGHT IT 
SEEMS TO HAVE STEADY THE SHIP A 
LITTLE BIT IT HAS NOT MAKE ME FLY 
SO MATCH BUT THERE IS A BIT MORE OF 
A MIDDLE GROUND MATCH L. NEED TO 
TRIED TO STAY STEADY THAT IS ALL 
THE WHILE LOOKING FOR IN TOP LEVEL 
SNOOKER ANYTHING REALLY IT IS THE 
CONSISTENCY YOU CAN BUILD ON TOP OF 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE BAN AND TEN THREE WIN 
AGAINST ANTHONY HAMILTON RAN OUT 
I SAID TOOK ALL THE POISE ALL THE 
BOYS IN THE CLUB I HAVE NOT GOT 
THE BOTTLE TO DO A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN L. L. WAS UNDER 
PRESSURE FROM TWENTY FOUR THE REDS WERE 
PERFECT THE CUSHIONS ARE PLAYING 
UP EIGHT LITTLE BIT L. WAS SCARED 
THAT IF I SCREWED BACK TOO MUCH 
I'LL GET A BOUNCE AND WOULD NOT GET 
ON TO THE REDS AS IT HAPPENED I 
LEFT MYSELF QUITE HORRIBLE AGAINST 
THE CUSHION YOU SHOULD NOT BE 
THINKING OF THE CUSHION YOU SHOULD 
BE THINKING OF THE SHOT AS YOU SEE 
IT L. THINK I ACTUALLY O. HAS 
ACCUSED ZERO THE CRUCIBLE EIGHT TILE IN 
DE TOILETTE L. L. DID NOT LOOK ROUND TO SEE WHAT IT WAS THE TOILET 
WE HAVE A SNOOKER EXTRA PROGRAMME 
ON THE WAY MARK KING VERSUS PETER 
EBDON IS THE FEATURED MATCH WHEN 
PLAY RESUMES AT TEN P. M. YOU CAN WATCH 
ALL THE ACTION WITH THE RED BUTTON 
THE MAIN ATTRACTION IS STEPHEN 
HENDRY AGAINST DING JOHN REID 
DING JUNHUI
