YOU COULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM THIS PLACE PLACE THERE'S SOMETHING CHARMING ABOUT 
BEING AMAN UNITED FAN IT'S BORING 
YOU CAN NEVER GET SICK OF SUCCESS 
ADRIAN BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW 
AND TWO PEOPLE WITH FOUR BRAINS 
BETWEEN THEM FOOD WRITER SOPHIE 
GRIGSON AND OUR SCIENCE MAN 
MICHAEL MOSLEY 
A STRESSFUL FRUSTRATING AFICTION 
FOR HALF A MILLION OF US RESEARCH 
SUGGESTS IF YOU TACKLE STAMMERING 
BEFORE THE AGE OF FIVE IT CAN BE 
ALL BUT SORTED OUT HOWEVER FOR TWO 
STAMMERERS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING 
WITH IT'S BEEN A LIFE LONG 
STRUGGLE MICHAEL'S FOLLOWED THEIR 
LATEST ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME THEIR 
PROBLEM PROBLEM PAUL AND REGIS HAVE SOMETHING IN 
COMMON SOMETHING THEY SHARE WITH 
MARILYN MONROE WINSTON CHURCHILL 
AND ABOUT HALF AL MILLION PEOPLE IN 
BRITAIN THEY STAMMER PAUL AND 
REGIS ARE FORTUNATE BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE MANAGED TO GET ON A TWO WEEK 
INTENSIVE COURSE WILL HOPEFULLY 
IMPROVE THEIR LIVES 
IT'S MADE LIFE MORE DIFFICULT NO 
DOUBT ABOUT IT AND THAT'S WHY I 
HAVE BEEN ON TWO SPEECH THERAPY 
MAJOR THERAPY SESSIONS BEFORE I I USE A LOT OF ENERGY ENERGY IN MY 
SPEAKING AND I HAVE A A KIND OF A 
A KIND OF STILL BODY WHILE I SPEAK 
PAUL AND REGIS ARE NOT GOING TO BE 
ATTENDING A HOSPITAL OR CLINIC 
THEY ARE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL IN 
FACT THIS SCHOOL HERE AT CITY LIT 
THEY HAVE BEEN TREATING STAMMERERS 
FOR FIFTEEN YEARS SIXTY FOUR YEAR OLD PAUL 
FIRST ATTENDED THIS COLLEGE IN THE 
SIXTIES BUT SINCE RETIRING HE HAS 
FOUND HIS SPEECH HAS DETERIORATED 
I WILL BE LOOKING FOR BETTER 
MANAGEMENT OF MY SPEECH THAT IS 
THE THING I WILL BE LOOKING FOR 
NOT A CURE BUT BETTER MANAGEMENT OF 
WHAT I DO 
SINCE CHILDHOOD REGIS 
HAS HAD A SEVERE SEVERE STAMMER HE 
FEARS IT IS HOLDING HIM BACK I I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT TO BE 
ABLE TO REALISE MY SKILLS AND MY 
POTENTIALS THAT IS WHY I CAME ON 
THE COURSE 
THE FIRST THING THE 
STUDENTS DO IS WATCH A VIDEO OF 
THEMSELVES TALKING THIS CAN BE 
QUITE A SHOCK 
AFTER LUNCH WE 
REVIEWED OUR VIDEOS THAT WERE MADE 
YESTERDAY I DIDN'T KNOW I DID SO 
MANY THINGS WHEN I WAS STAMMERING 
I WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A CHOICE OR 
NOT TO STAMMER THAT IS THE WHOLE 
IDEA IT SOUNDS EASY BUT IT NEEDS 
A LOT OF HARD WORK IT NEEDS A LOT 
OF BELIEF L. NEED A LOT OF PRACTISE 
WHAT IS STAMMERING THE DRINKSARY 
DEFINITION IS TO SPEAK WITH 
INVOLUNTARY PAUSES OR REPETITIONS 
NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT CAUSES IT 
BUT IT IS LIKELY TO BE 
COMBINATION OF FACTORS 
MOST PEOPLE 
WHO STAMMER START TO STAMMER WHEN 
THEY ARE YOUNG CHILDREN IT SEEMS 
LIKE FOR CERTAINLY A LOT OF PEOPLE 
THERE MIGHT BE SOME UNDERLYING 
NEURO NEURO PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTOR 
SO MAYBE THERE IS A PREDISPOSITION 
BUT THEN MAYBE OTHER FACTORS COME 
INTO PLAY IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO 
DO WITH THE PERSONALITY OF THE 
CHILD THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO 
TRIGGER IT 
THERE IS A WIDE RANGE 
OF TECHNIQUES AVAILABLE TO TO TREAT 
STAMMERING IN ADULTS FROM 
BREATHING EXERCISES AND 
PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO 
ELECTRONIC DEVICES 
WE DON'T HAVE 
ONE TECHNIQUE WE TRY AND WORK ON 
STAMMERING IN A HOLISTIC WAY WE 
TRY AND WORK ON THE INTERNAL 
ASPECTS SO THEY CAN BECOME MORE 
OPEN AND FACE THEIR FEARS AND THAT 
THAT MAKES IT EASIER FOR THEM TO 
USE THESE SPEECH TECHNIQUES WHO 
THINK THEY ARE THEY ARE UP FOR 
GOING OUT THIS AND DOING THIS 
REGIS WHAT MIGHT ONE OR TWO OF 
YOUR COMMUNICATION AIMS BE FOR 
YOURSELF 
TO BE ABLE TO LOOK THEM YOURSELF IN THE EYE AND BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT 
I WANT TO SAY AND BE ABLE TO 
STAMMER IN THEIR FACE WITHOUT BEING 
SCARED 
PAUL AND REGIS ARE COMING SCARED TO THE END OF THEIR TWO WEEK COURSE 
AND TODAY THEY FACE A REAL 
CHALLENGE THEY HAVE TO GO OUT ON 
THE STREET CONFRONT PERFECT 
STRANGERS AND ENGAGE THEM IN 
CONFIDENT FLUENT CONVERSATION GOOD 
LUCK GUYS HOPE IT GOES WELL L. 
WILL BE FOLLOWING YOU FROM A 
DISTANCE 
I HAVE A STAMMER I AM IN A SPEECH 
COURSE DO YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO 
STAMMERS PLEASE 
WOULD YOU BE ABLE 
TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT 
STAMMERING YES 
I HAVE DONE FOUR STAMMERING YES INTERVIEWS I HAVE SPOKEN WITH 
PEOPLE OLD AND YOUNG HAVE 
SPOKEN TO MALE AND FEMALE 
HE IS 
DOING WELL 
I HAVE FOUR LAST ONE 
WAS A VERY LONG CONVERSATION WHICH 
WAS VERY INTERESTING VERY POSITIVE 
FEED BACK FROM ALL THESE PEOPLE 
THAT'S REWARDING 
PAUL AND REGIS'S 
STAMMERS HAVE BOTH MARKETEDLY 
IMPROVED OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS 
BUT WHAT HAVE THEY REALLY LEARNT I I THINK IF YOU HAVE MADE THE LEAP OF 
COMING ON THIS COURSE YOU HAVE 
MADE THE LEAP THAT YOU REALLY WANT 
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
IT'S ALL 
ABOUT THE FEAR GO OUT THERE SAY 
THE WORD GO FOR IT YOU STAMMER 
NO PROBLEM 
I AM DELIGHTED TO SAY 
MICHAEL HAS BEEN BRAVE ENOUGH TO 
COME IN HERE REGIS I AM SORRY L. 
WAS TRYING TO THROW YOU THERE THAT 
COURSE HELPED YOU THEN 
OF COURSE 
IT DID BECAUSE I HAVE HAD A 
STAMMER FOR A LONG TIME AND WENT 
ON THE COURSE AND I WAS REALLY 
STRUGGLING IN MY SPEECH L. STARTED 
TO GO ON THE COURSE WITH THE 
SUPPORT OF MY FRIEND JOHN AND MY 
LINE MANAGER WHO WAS HELPING ME AS 
WELL WHOM I REALLY THANK A LOT FOR 
THE SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT BUT 
THE COURSE HAS HAS REALLY CHANGED 
MY LIFE 
WHAT HAS IT TAUGHT YOU 
HOW HAVE YOU LEARNT TO SPEAK MORE 
FLEWENTLY 
IT HAS MADE ME THE FLEWENTLY ATTRIBUTE OF BEING PATIENT BEING 
SLOW IN MY SPEECH NOT FEARING IF I 
STAMMER OR NOT TO BE ABLE TO GO 
FOR THE WORD AND SAY IT OUT AND 
JUST GO FOR IT JUST AS I SAID IN 
THE EARLIER INTERVOW CONQUER THE 
FEAR OF STAMMERING DON'T AVOID IT 
WELL DONE 
REALLY PROUD OF YOU REGIS MICHAEL 
WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE IT 
IS A CASE OF NEVER GIVING UP ISN'T 
IT 
IT IS REGIS HAS DEMONSTRATED IT THE POWER OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU 
ACTUALLY GO AND GET THE RIGHT 
THERAPY YOU CAN GO AND SEE YOUR G. P. 
WHO HOPEFULLY WILL REFER YOU TO A 
SPEECH THERAPIST OR YOU COULD 
CONTACT THE BRITISH STAMMERING 
ASSOCIATION WHO HAVE LOTS OF 
INTERESTING INFORMATION 
THERAPY IS 
ALWAYS IMPROVING AND CHANGING YES YES THEY ARE DOING LOTS OF RESEARCH IT 
IS A FASCINATING AREA 
WHY CAN YOU 
NOT STAMMER WHEN YOU SING THEY THEY THINK IT IS AN AREA OF THE BRAIN 
THAT IS AFFECTED POSSIBLY L. WAS 
GOING TO ASK YOU TO SING AN AREA 
OF THE BRAIN CONTROLS MOVEMENT AND 
IN SINGING YOU KEEP GOING GARETH 
GATES WAS AN EXAMPLE 
YOU LEARN THE 
WORDS IN ADVANCE 
IT IS A BIT 
SPONTANEOUS IN SINGING YOU FOLLOW 
THE FLOW IT IS UP AND DOWN BUT IN 
SPEAKING 
YOU START YOU STOP WOULD WOULD YOU LIKE TO FINISH BY GIVING US A 
SONG ONLY JOKING 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY REGIS 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH 
THE WEATHER HAS BEEN 
LOVELY IF THIS WEATHER KEEPS UP 
MILLIONS OF US WILL SAY LET'S ALL 
GO FOR A PICK ANYMORE HOW IS THE 
IDEA OF THE GREAT BRITISH PICNIC 
BORN THE QUESTION FROM ONE OF OUR 
FINEST FOOD WRITERS SOPHIE GRIGSON 
EATING OUT OF DOORS HAS LONG BEEN A 
PART OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE IN 
BRITAIN WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT SINCE 
MEDIEVAL TIMES BUT THESE WERE NOT 
CALLED PICNICS UNTIL THE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDREDS 
UNTIL THE A FRENCH COIN WAS TERMED 
TO DESCRIBE AN ALFRESCO POT LUCK 
ISN'T IT A SHAME THAT PICNICS THESE 
DAYS ARE NOT THE GRAND AFFAIRS THEY 
ONCE WERE THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO 
CONSIST OF A COUPLE OF SOGGY 
SANDWICHES GOBBLED DOWN SPEEDILY 
SITTING ON A PATCH OF DAMP GRASS 
AND ALL WASHED DOWN WITH A BOTTLE 
OF POP 
IT IS A WORLD AWAY FROM THE 
ARTIST'S MANET'S DEPICTION L. HAVE 
TO SAY THAT GIRL IS DEFINITELY NOT 
PROPERLY ATTIRED FOR THE OCCASION 
BY THE MID SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS WHEN THE 
TERM CAN CROSSED OVER IT HAD COME 
TO MEAN A LAVISH EXCURSION WITH 
FOOD LATER ON THE VICTORIANS 
BELIEVED THE PICNIC SHOULD BE THE 
OUTDOOR COUSINS OF AFTERNOON TEAM 
ENJOYED WITH THE VERY BEST OF 
MANNERS EACH AND EVERY MEMBER OF A 
PICNIC WAS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A 
SHARE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT GAMES 
LIKE CROQUET AND BLIND MAN'S BUFF 
WERE FEATURED AMUSEMENTS IN THE 
NINETEEN TWENTIES PICNICS CONTINUED TO BE ALL 
THE RAGE AND WERE POPULAR AS A WAY 
OF COURTING COUPLES CAN SPEND A 
LAZY AFTERNOON RELAXING TO WHAT WAS 
THE PERSONAL STEREO OF THE DAY BUT 
ETIQUETTE REMAINED OF UTMOST 
IMPORTANCE IMPORTANCE LIFE WAS NO PICNIC DURING THE 
SECOND WORLD WAR AFTER ALL THE 
COUNTRY WAS STILL UNDER RATIONS 
UNTIL NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR SO PICNICS HAD TO BE 
SCALED DOWN MORE AFFORDABLE 
TRANSPORT ALSO MEANT THAT WORKING 
CLASS BRITAIN COULD NOW TAKE TO THE 
ROADS THE FOOD WASN'T UP TO MUCH 
BUT THE SENTIMENT AND SENSE OF FUN 
WAS DEFINITELY STILL THERE 
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS I THINK YOU 
WILL AGREE THE REAL BENEFITS OF 
PICNICS INCLUDE MUCH MORE THAN GOOD 
FOOD AND FRESH AIR WHAT MAKES A 
PICNIC SPECIAL IS PERHAPS THE LOVE 
YOU PREPARE IT WITH AND WHO YOU 
SHARE IT WITH 
VICTORIAN 
YOU CAN SERVE US THE NICE 
SANDWICHES SANDWICHES ETIQUETTE RULINGS THIS IS A LIST 
OF THESE WHAT ARE THE MOST 
IMPORTANT ONES 
I THINK THERE ARE 
MANY RULES FAR TOO MANY TO SQUEEZE 
IN ONE OF THE ONES I WOULD LIKE TO 
TELL YOU ABOUT IS WOMEN HAVE MORE 
MORE TENDER NERVES AND 
CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE TAKEN WHEN 
CHOOSING A PICNIC SITE SO A SITE 
SET ABOVE A VERY HIGH CLIFF WITH A 
STARTLING VIEW MAY ALARM THE FEMALE 
GUEST 
WE ARE ON THE EDGE OF A HIGH GUEST PRIS PISS NOW 
I AM 
RULE TWO I AM HOPING THEY HAVE 
SORTED THIS ONE OUT CARE MUST ALSO 
BE TAKEN TO SEE THAT THE GUESTS ARE 
NOT SEATED UPON AN ANT HILL 
JUST CHECKING 
DID YOU LIKE PICNICS BECAUSE THEY 
INVOLVE TO ME SITTING IN A VERY 
UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION WITH YOUR 
GLASS FALLING OVER LOADS OF 
INSECTS ABOUT AND KIDS PLAYING OFF 
AM I A MISERY 
YES YOU ARE LOVE 
I LOVE GOING WITH MY KIDS 
MY KIDS ARE 
GREAT PICNICKERS WE WILL G. 
PICNICKING AT THE DROP OF A HAT DO DO YOU SIT ON THE FLOOR 
THAT DEFINES A PICNIC A BLANKET 
LOOK AT EAMONN'S POSITION 
THAT IS 
THE ARTHRITIS 
WE WILL BRING ONE OF 
THE FOLDING CHAIRS FOR YOU THE ONE 
THAT COLLAPSES WHEN GRANNY SITS ON 
IT OR EAMONN 
I LOVE THE IDEA OF IT 
DON'T YOU LIKE 
THE IDEA OF IT BUT BUT THE REALITY IS GRIM OFTEN IT'S IT'S LOVELY AS LONG AS EVERYBODY IS 
PREPARED TO PITCH IN AND ENJOY IT 
IT IS VERY BRITISH THAT SENSE OF 
WE ARE GOING TO ENJOY A PICNIC 
WHATEVER IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT 
RAINS IF YOU HAVE TO HUDDLE IN THE 
CAR OR UNDER THE TREES YOU ARE 
JUST GOING TO HAVE TO GO OUT AND 
HAVE A GOOD TIME FOOD EATEN 
OUTSIDE TASTES BETTER 
I AGREE WITH 
THAT EVEN SCOTCH EGGS DO YOU HAVE 
TO HAVE SCOTCH EGGS 
DID YOU KNOW 
THAT SCOTCH EGGS AREN'T SCOTCH 
THEY WERE INVENTED BY FORTNUM AND AMP 
MASONS SCOTCH EGGS I WOULD SAY I 
WOULD ONLY HAD A SCOTCH EGG IF I 
MADE IT MYSELF BOUGHT ONES THEY 
TEND TO RATTLE IT'S ALL DRYING OUT 
INSIDE HOME MADE SCOTCH EGG 
PERFECT PICNIC FOOD IT HASN'T GOT 
VEGETABLES 
NOT TOO MESSY TO EAT VEGETABLES EAMONN TELL US ABOUT THE BOOK WHAT 
YOU'VE WRITTEN WE NEED A COUPLE OF 
STRONG BLEX TO GET HIM UP FROM THAT 
POSITION 
TO KEEP THE KIDS OCCUPIED POSITION AT A PICNIC OR TRAVELLING TO A 
PICNIC WHICH CAN BE WORSE THAN A 
PICNIC ITSELF THIS IS A BOOK 
CALLED WHERE DID THE RIVER GO IT 
IS A LISCY AND NUMERACY TEST NOT 
ONLY FOR KIDS BUT FOR ADULTS AS 
WELL ADULTS READING TO THEIR KIDS 
YOU MAY FIND OUT THEY ARE LACKING 
IN A FEW AREAS AND HELP IS 
AVAILABLE THIS IS FROM LEARN 
DIRECT THESE BOOKS ARE FREE THIS 
IS THE BEST NEWS OF ALL 
GO ON THE 
WEBSITE AND YOU CAN KEEP THE KIDS 
ENTERTAIN ENTERTAIN IT IS ABOUT TWO CHARACTERS AND TO 
FIND THE RIVER YOU NEED TO GO TO 
THE SOURCE OF IT WORK IT OUT YOU 
MUST GO ONE KILOMETRE NORTH ONE 
EAST TWO KILOMETRES WEST AND 
FINALLY ONE KILOMETRE EAST THE 
QUESTION IS WORK OUT HOW FAR THEY 
WILL HAVE TO WALK 
YOU LOST ME 
AFTER THE FIRST ONE THANK YOU FOR 
THAT THAT AT EAST NOW 
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS PICTURE IT 
COULD BE THE SOUTH'S ANSWER TO THE 
ANGEL OF THE NORTH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOOT HIGH 
GIANT HORSE STATUE BY MARK 
WALLINGER IS ONE OF FIVE LISTED TO 
GO ON PERMANENT SHOW MAYBE IT'S 
THE FRONTRUNNER BECAUSE THE HORSE 
IS ENSHRINED IN OUR HISTORY THE 
SUFFOLK PUNCH IS ACTUALLY THE 
OLDEST OF BRITAIN'S HEAVY HORSE 
BREEDS THEY WERE REALLY IMPORTANT 
TO AGRICULTURE BEFORE MACHINERY 
TOOK HOLD IN EASTERN EUROPE YOU 
STILL SEE THESE HORSES IN USE TODAY 
BUT THEY ARE MASSIVE IMPORTANT 
SINCE THE MACHINERY STARTED DOING 
ALL THE HEAVY LIFTING IT'S BECOME 
AN ENDANGERED SPECIES RARER THAN 
THE GIANT PANDA WE MADE A FIELD 
TRIP TO EAST ANGLIA TO SEE A PAIR 
OF THEM AT WORK 
THE GENTLY ROLLING LANDSCAPE OF 
THIS FARM IS IN THE HEART OF 
EASTAGIA IT'S ALL PEACE AND 
TRANQUILITY ONLY INTERRUPTED BY 
THE LEISURELY PACE OF A HORSE DRAWN 
PLOUGH IT IS SCENE THAT ONLY 
CONSTABLE COULD HAVE FEASTED HIS 
EYES ON BUT HOLD ON THIS ISN'T 
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT'S THE TWENTY FIRST OF 
COURSE FARMERS TODAY USE WAY MORE 
EFFICIENT METHODS TO PLOUGH THEIR 
FIELDS A TRACTOR WILL PLOUGH IN 
MUCH LESS TIME AND IS WAY LESS 
INTENSIVE THAN THE HORSE BUT 
HAVING SAID THAT IT'S PRETTY 
SMELLY AND PRETTY LOUD AND ONE 
PLAN HAS DECIDED TO PLOUGH THE OLD 
FASHIONED WAY ROGER CLARKE KEEPS 
SUFFOLK PUNCHS THE OLDEST AND 
RAREST OF THE HEAVY HORSE BREEDS 
AS TRACTORS TOOK OVER ON FARMS 
WORKING HORSES LIKE THESE 
DECLINED ALMOST TO EXTINCTION NOW 
THERE ARE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED SUFFOLK 
PUNCHS AND THIS IS DOWN TO THE 
PASSION OF PEOPLE LIKE ROGERMENT 
HELLO ROGER 
GOOD MORNING 
HOW IS 
THE PLOUGHING GOING 
PRETTY GOOD 
WHY ARE YOU STILL PLOUGHING WITH 
HORSES 
BASICALLY BECAUSE I LIKE HORSES PLOUGHING WITH HORSES IT'S THE 
BEST GUISE OF WORK EVER PUT ON BUT BUT IT MUST BE SLOW FOR MODERN FARMING 
WELL IT IS BUT IF YOU HAVE THE 
TIME IT'S VERY THERAPUTIC WAY TO 
SPEND THE DAY USE THEM BECAUSE I 
LIKE USING THEM AND WELL IT'S 
SOMETHING ABOUT THE SKILL OF USING 
THEM A SHEPHERD WILL TELL YOU 
EXACTLY THE SAME ABOUT WORKING A 
SHEEPDOG AND A HUNTSMAN WILL TELL 
YOU EXACTLY THE SAME ABOUT USING 
PACK OF HOUNDS IT'S THE RAPPORT 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE 
WHO ARE THEY 
JESTER IS IN THE FARO AND NED IS 
ON THE LAND 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE 
SUFFOLK PUNCH 
BECAUSE I'M A 
SUFFOLK MAN IT'S AS SIX AS THAT 
EACH HORSE ON THE STUD BOOK TODAY 
GOES BACK TO A LINE TO ONE THOUSAND SIXTY 
AND THEY HAVE BEEN BRED THAT SHAPE 
YES IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CENTRE OF 
GRAVITY THAT THE WIDER THE LEGS 
THE SHORTER THEIR CENTRE OF GRAVITY 
I'VE HEARD THEY CAN PULL THEIR OWN 
WEIGHT 
TWICE THEIR OWN WEIGHT SO WEIGHT SO HOW HARD IS IT TO PLOUGH WITH THESE 
HORSES 
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO HORSES FIND OUT AND THAT IF YOU HAVE A GO 
OH GOOD I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD 
SAY THAT 
NOW ONE THING TO 
REMEMBER YOU LET THE HORSES DO ALL 
THE WORK 
SO YOU JUST PICK IT UP 
NO YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING IT'S 
LIKE I SAY IT'S THE BEST DISGUISE 
FOR WORK EVER PUT ON 
WOW THAT'S AMAZING IT IS 
UNBELIEVABLE POWERMENT YES IT'S YES IT'S FAIRLY EASY ALTHOUGH THE PROOF OF 
THE PUDDING WILL BE IN MY FURROW 
HOW DO WE STOP IT 
WHOH HUP THAT THAT THAT'S HOW YOU STOP 
I THINK IT'S A 
BIT WONKY 
IT'S NOT TOO BAD YOU 
NEED TO SEE A MOUSE RUN OUT OF THE 
OTHER END AND 
YOU KNOW YOU'VE 
DONE A GOOD FARO YES 
NO MOUSE FOR YES ME THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT 
WALKING BEHIND THE HORSES AND 
HEARING THE EARTH TURNING IT WAS 
SUCH JOY AND YOU REALLY GET 
SENSE OF THE TERM HORSE POWER 
THEY ARE 
ANIMALS THE 
THEY ARE MAGNIFICENT ANIMALS THE SUFFOLK PUNCH STANDS NEARLY SIX 
FEET TALL BUT THIS ONE IS JUST TWENTY ONE 
INCHES IT IS THE SMALLEST HORSE IN 
BRITAIN AND SHE IS FITTINGLY CALLED 
MINI MOUSE HOW CUTE IS THAT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SANDRA FOR 
BRINGING HER IN 
IS SHE REAL YES YES WE'RE NOT IMAGINING IT BUT SHE HAD 
A ROCKY START DIDN'T SHE 
SHE SHE 
WAS TAKEN INTO THE LOCAL VET WITH 
STRANGLES AND THEY HAD TO CUT A 
HOLE IN HER NECK TO HELP HER 
BREATHE THEY KEPT HER FOR FIVE 
MONTHS BECAUSE THEY FELL IN LOVE 
WITH HER AND THEN SHE CAME TO MY 
RESCUE CENTRE TO STAY WITH THE 
OTHER LITTLE PONIES 
SHE'S LOOKING 
VERY WORRIEDLY AT EAMONN THAT SHE 
MIGHT HAVE TO GIVE HIM A LIFT HOME 
WHAT SORT OF LIFE DOES SHE HAVE IS 
SHE JUST A LOVELY PET 
YES SHE 
LIVES ALL OUR OTHER SHETLANDS AND 
BIGGER HORSES AND RUNS AROUND THE 
FIELD ALL DAY 
SO IS SHE SMALL 
BECAUSE OF THE BREED OR BECAUSE 
SHE HAD A BAD START 
I THINK SHE IS 
JUST NATURALLY SMALL MOST 
SHETLANDS WOULD BE FORTY THREE INCHES HIGH 
COULD YOU RIDE HER 
NO SHE IS TOO 
SMALL YOU COULD PUT A BABY ON HER 
MAYBE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MAYBE BRINGING HER IN SHE IS LOVELY

NOW THE SCARY TALE OF JEKYLL AND 
HYDE IS A STORY THAT HAS SHOCKED 
AND FASCINATED US FOR TWO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT TWO 
SPRART CHARACTERS TWO DESPERATE 
CHARACTERS TORTURING ONE SOUL 
ALTHOUGH IT IS SET IN LONDON OH 
THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ITS 
INSPIRATION LAY SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF 
MILES NORTH THE ANCIENT METROPOLIS 
OF THE NORTH SITS LOOK OVER AN 
ESTUARY FROM THE SUMMIT OF THREE 
HILLS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE IS SHE IS 
NOT SO MUCH BEAUTIFUL AS 
INTERESTING ABOVE ALL SHE IS A 
CURIOSITY CURIOSITY ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON WROTE THESE 
WORDS ABOUT EDINBURGH HIS NATIVE 
CITY IT WAS A PLACE THAT 
FASCINATED HIM WITH ITS BUSTLING 
MAIN STREETS AND MYSTERIOUS DARK 
ALLIES AND IT WOULD BE THE 
INSPIRATION FOR ONE OF HIS MOST 
FAMOUS BOOKS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ROBERT LOUIS 
STEVENSON WROTE THE STRANGE CASE OF 
DOCTOR JEKYLL AND MR. HIDE FOR 
EVERYONE WHO KNOWS THE BOOK THERE 
IS EDINBURGH IN EVERY PAGE AND YET 
STRANGELY IT IS NOT SET HERE IT 
IS SET IN LONDON AND TELLS THE TALE 
OF DOCTOR JEKYLL AND HIS EVIL ALTER EGO 
MR. HYDE BUT STEPHENSON ALTHOUGH 
RAISED IN THE NEW TOWN HE WAS 
DRAWN TO THE SINISTER UNDERWORLD OF 
THE OLD TOWN THE DISMAL QUARTER 
OF SOHO SEEN UNDER THE CHANGING 
WAYS WITH SHRAT EARLY PASS AGES 
SEEMED LIKE A CITY UNDER A 
NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE EDINBURGH'S SQUALOR AND ELLE GANS 
SUITED THE TWIN CHARACTERS OF 
JEKYLL AND HYDE PERFECTLY I'VE 
COME TO MEET AN EXPERT ANNA ON 
THE BOOK TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT 
THE BOOK YOU'VE BROUGHT ME DOWN 
THIS ALLEY WHERE STEPHENSON ONCE 
WALKED DO THINK IT IS TRUE THAT 
THE OLD TOWN REPRESENTS THE EVIL I I THINK IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT 
STEPHENSON USED TO LEAVE THE 
GRANDEUR OF THE NEW TOWN TO SKULK 
IN THE OLD TOWN WHICH HE FELT WAS 
ROTTEN TO THE CORE AND HE LEARNT A 
LOT ABOUT THE DARK SIDE OF HUMAN 
NATURE FROM THIS PART OF TOWN WHEN WHEN HE COMES HERE TO LOOK AT THE DENS 
OF INIQUITY WAS IT TO EXPLORE HIS 
DARK SIDE 
I THINK HE DID BECOME 
ADDICTED TO SEEKING OUT THE DARKER 
SIDES OF EDINBURGH SOCIETY EVEN EVEN HIS GOOD SHONE UPON THE COUNT NENS 
OF ONE EDWARD HJDE ALONE IN THE 
RANKS OF MANKIND WAS PURE EVIL 
FOR STEPHENSON THE IDEA OF THE 
MEDICAL MAN WITH A HIDDEN BEASTIAL 
SIDE WAS MORE THAN JUST FANTASY IT 
WAS PART OF THIS CITY'S HISTORY 
STEPHENSON GREW UP HEARING STORIES 
OF THE DOCTORS OF THIS TOWN AND THE 
MACABREER SECRETS THEY KEPT I'VE 
COME TO THE MUSEUM TO HEAR THE 
STORIES OF THE INFAMOUS BODY 
SNATCHERS FROM CHILDHOOD ONWARDS 
STEPHENSON IS SOAKED IN THE STORIES 
OF EDINBURGH 
ABSOLUTELY HE HAD A 
STORY TELLING NURSE WHO SCARED HIM 
WITLESS AND ONE OF THE FAMOUS 
STORIES WERE OF BURKE AND HAIR WHO 
WERE REALLY MASS MURDERERS BUT 
WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS PREYING ON 
VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND KILLING THEM 
AND SELLING THEM FOR DISSECTIONS TO 
THE ANATOMISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY 
SO HOW DO THOSE TWO GET US TO 
JEKYLL AND HYDE 
IT'S THE MEDICAL 
CONNECTION THIS IDEA OF SELLING 
CORPSES BRINGS US TO THE DARK WORLD 
OF THE BACKSTREETS OF EDINBURGH AND 
THE WORLD OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF 
SCIENCE AND RESEARCH AND MEDICINE 
THAT WAS THE CITY OF STEPHENSON'S 
UPBRINGING AND WHEN YOU READ 
JEKYLL AND HYDE YOU FEEL IT IS 
ABSOLUTELY SATURATED WITH THAT 
ATMOSPHERE ATMOSPHERE EAMONN YOU WERE STUDYING THAT 
THERE HAVE YOU GOT A DARK SIDE I I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY A LESS 
INTERESTING PERSON IF YOU DON'T 
HAVE A WEE BIT OF A DARK SIDE OH OH THAT'S INTERESTING AND PROFOUND OH OH I THINK SO IT MAKES ONE A BIT MORE 
INTERESTING 
YOU'RE SPOOKING ME INTERESTING I GET VERY DARK WHEN I'M WATCHING 
FOOTBALL 
BECAUSE MANCHESTER UNITED FOOTBALL HAVE SUCH AN AWFUL TIME 
WELL IT 
COULD HAVE ALL GONE WRONG 
GOOD TO 
HAVE YOU WITH US EAMONN LEARN LEARN DIRECT WEBSITE THAT'S WHERE YOU 
CAN GET THAT BOOK 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH AND TOMORROW STACK UP THE 
KRISPY KREMES AND PUT YOUR MEET IN
