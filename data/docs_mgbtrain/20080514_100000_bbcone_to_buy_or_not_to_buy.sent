THIS IS NO ORDINARY PROPERTY SHOW THIS IS THE SUMPTUOUS AND EXTRAORDINARY TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
WE'LL BE SIMMERING ON A LOW HEAT FOR THE NEXT TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES 
AND JUST BEFORE WE BRING OURSELVES TO A BOIL WE'LL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO TRY 
BEFORE YOU BUY 
NOW BUYING A NEW HOUSE REQUIRES LOTS OF NERVE PATIENCE RESEARCH AND A TOUCH OF LADY LUCK 
WORKING OUT WHAT'S HOT OR NOT COULD INFLAME YOUR PROPERTY TEMPER 
TO BOILING POINT AND LEAVE YOU LAIN BARE ON THE HOT COALS OF FRONT DOOR DESPAIR ABSOLUTELY 
BUT IF YOU ENTRUST US WITH YOUR HOUSE BUYING DRAMAS THEN WE'LL PULL YOU OUT OF THOSE PROPERTY ASHES 
WE WILL MAKE YOU HOT TO TROT AS YOU CLIMB UP 
THE PROPERTY LADDER 
BUYERS ANDY AND BECKA HERBERT HAVE LIVED IN THIS TERRACED HOUSE IN WOLVERHAMPTON FOR THREE YEARS 
BUT NOW THEY'VE DECIDED TO SPIN THE PROPERTY WHEEL OF FORTUNE AND LEAP UP THE LADDER LIKE YOUNG GAZELLES

THEY'RE NOT SCARED OF PLAYING WITH FIRE IN FACT ANDY QUITE LIKES EATING IT 
NO CALORIES IN THAT 
AND BECKA'S LEARNING TO DANCE WITH FLAMING RIBBONS 
BUT CAN SHE DO A HOT SHOE SHUFFLE THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT 
O. K. BECKA AND ANDY I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO HOUSE HUNTING AND WE'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT THAT 
BUT BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THAT I WANT TO HAVE SOME DIALOGUE HERE 
ABOUT YOUR FIRE EATING BREATHING THING THAT YOU BOTH HAVE

COULD YOU BREATHE OUT FIRE ARE YOU LIKE A DRAGON COULD YOU JUST

WOULD YOU BE PREPARED TO GO DOWNSTAIRS TO THE TOILET

YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT

NEWLY DECORATED THERE'S REALLY NOTHING WRONG WITH IT AT ALL THAT I CAN THINK OF O. K. LOOK AT THIS 
THIS IS A PERFECT DRAGON'S DEN HE BREATHES FIRE DRAGON'S DEN 
YOU COULD FIND A LOVELY HOUSE IN THERE YOU COULD FIND A LOVELY FIVE HOUSES JUST IN THE BACK GARDEN 
WHY IS IT LARGE IT'S MASSIVE THE BACK GARDEN FIVE SEPARATE HOUSES IN THE BACK GARDEN IF 
I'M NOT SAYING ANY MORE 
AND THEN ODDLY WHEN IT CAME TO CHOOSING OUR WILD CARD WHICH IS OUR JOINT CHOICE 
WE BOTH VISITED THE SAME ESTATE AGENT CAN YOU IMAGINE 
AND WE BOTH FOUND THE SAME HOUSE THIS 
OUT OF ALL OF THEM IT MIGHT BE THE ONE O. K. LET'S HOPE SO 
SO THERE ARE THREE CHOICES 
TIME TO COMMENCE THE VIEWINGS AT 
PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
OUR FIRST OFFERING IS MY CHOICE AND IT'S A NINETEEN THIRTIES SEMI WITH A WOW FACTOR 
REALLY ACRES OF SPACE DOWNSTAIRS AND UP 
EXTENDED KITCHEN THREE BEDROOMS CONSERVATORY LIVING FLAME GAS FIRE 
TWO LOOS THREE SHEDS WHAT MORE CAN I SAY I THINK YOU'VE SAID IT ALL

ONE POINT NINE DRAGON MILES GO ON OUT THE BACK COUNT HOW MANY SHEDS I'VE GIVEN YOU 
A LOT YOU COULD BE IN THERE YOU COULD PRACTISE YOUR POI IN THERE IF YOU'RE ON YOUR KNEES O. K. 
SLIGHTLY YOU COULD WORK ON NEW FIRE BREATHING ROUTINES 
MAYBE NOT IN A WOODEN SHED ACTUALLY 
DON'T DO THAT DON'T DO THAT OTHERWISE WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
IT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD SIZE 
IT'S GOT NICE PARKING OUT THE FRONT IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
WHAT YOU'D WANT TO BE DOING OUT THE FRONT IS THE POI MANOEUVRES 
I'VE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY ABOUT THE HOUSE APART FROM IT'S BRILLIANT BUT EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO 
I'LL BE BUYING YOU A NEW POI 
DO YOU WANT TO GET IN THE HOUSE AND HAVE A LOOK ROUND AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER 
I'VE JUST BROKEN HER POI 
ARE THEY EXPENSIVE I HAVE NO IDEA 
THIS COULD BE A COSTLY SHOOT 
WOW 
I FEEL SO TERRIBLE ABOUT THAT 
WHEN YOU DO BREAK A WOMAN'S HOBBY EXPECT REPERCUSSIONS HOPEFULLY THE HOUSE WILL MAKE UP FOR IT 
THE HALLWAY YEAH A DEFINITE MOVE UP 
THEY WANTED A HALLWAY THEY SPECIALLY REQUESTED A HALLWAY AND YOU'VE GIVEN THEM ONE 
RADIATOR IT'S A GOOD START 
APPARENTLY A RADIATOR IS A GOOD START 
TO ANDY IT IS 
AH HOW BIG'S YOURS 
THERE'S ACTUALLY A TOILET IN IT 
OH WOW O. K. 
IT'S GOT A DOWNSTAIRS TOILET HERE BUT NOT A DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM THE BATHROOM'S UPSTAIRS 
THIS IS NICE AND LIGHT YEAH 
IT'S HUGE WITH A NICE LOOK THROUGH TO THE BACK AS WELL 
WOW 
THEY'RE SOUNDING QUITE UPBEAT CONSIDERING I'VE JUST BROKEN THEIR POI I FEEL TERRIBLE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PUSHING THROUGH THAT YOU CAN'T FOCUS ON A WHIRLIGIG 
YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT HOUSE BUYING IT'S THE BIGGER PICTURE 
I LOVE THE FIRE YEAH IT'S A NICE FIREPLACE ISN'T IT 
IT DOESN'T NEED A LOT OF WORK ACTUALLY WHICH IS GOOD 
HEY THEY'RE RIGHT 
IT DOESN'T NEED ANY WORK THAT'S WHY I PICKED THEM THIS PLACE 
WHEN THEY COME INTO THE GARDEN THEY'LL REALISE I'VE GOT FOUR SHEDS AND A GREENHOUSE 
HOW MANY POWER SOCKETS 
A FEW SOCKETS AROUND AS WELL 
THAT'S QUITE NICE 
I LOVE IT WHEN A MAN DOES COUNT POWER SOCKETS IN A PLACE 
DOES IT PROVE THAT YOU'RE A PROPER MAN 
HE'S ACCEPTED THE HOUSE NOW AND HE'S JUST FOCUSING ON THE SMALL DETAILS POWER SOCKETS BRILLIANT 
IN THAT ROOM DOWNSTAIRS I WENT ROUND AND COUNTED SIXTEEN POWER SOCKETS IT'S A SIXTEEN POWERER 
SOME DOUBLE SOME SINGLE JUST SPREAD OUT 
IT'S NOT A HUGE DINING ROOM I THINK WE'D PROBABLY 
IT'S NOT BUT IT DOES HAVE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST FRIDGE FREEZER 
I THINK I'VE GOT A SOLUTION TO THAT POI SCENARIO 
WHICH IS 
YOU TAKE THIS YOU GET THIS AND IT'S JUST ABOUT SWINGING IT ROUND 
IN A GREENHOUSE 
LIKE THAT AND I THINK 
I DON'T THINK SHE'LL NOTICE I'LL GET SOME RIBBONS SILK RIBBONS ON THIS COULD WE SET THAT ON FIRE 
I MUST SAY I'M PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WHICH I'M SURE ED WILL LIKE 
WHAT ABOUT THIS IS THIS AS PRACTICAL AS THE LAST ONE LET'S FIND OUT TYING RIBBONS TO THAT 
I LIKE THAT THE SINK 
YOU CAN LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW YEAH 
ALWAYS DESTROYING OUTSIDE FURNITURE AREN'T YOU 
IT'S A BIT OF A SHAME THAT THE SHED'S COMING THAT FAR AWAY OUT 
BUT THAT'S A BIG SHED 
IT'S MORE OF A SUMMER HOUSE REALLY ISN'T IT 
YOU'VE GIVEN THEM SO MANY SHEDS THAT GARDEN LOOKS LIKE AN ALPINE VILLAGE FOUR SHEDS AND A GLASS ONE 
I DIDN'T THINK WE'D GET A CONSERVATORY FOR OUR BUDGET 
IT'S REALLY NICE AND THEY'VE WORKED REALLY HARD ON THAT GARDEN I REALLY LIKE IT 
THE BEAUTY OF THEM THEY COULD BE LIKE OUTDOOR HEATERS IN THE WINTER 
IF YOU JUST HAD AL FRESCO DINING 
HE WOULD JUST COCK HIS NECK UP PUT LIKE A BIN LID ABOVE HIM 
AND THE HEAT WOULD WARM EVERYONE BENEATH HIM 
I COULD ENJOY A BRUSCHETTA WHILE BEING WARM 
YOU COULD COME IN HERE AND PLAY YOUR GUITAR AND I COULD SHUT THE DOOR 
AND I'D BE IN PEACE AND QUIET 
YEAH SHALL WE GIVE IT A TRY 
YEAH YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE IT 
MARVELLOUS YEAH SORRY I CAN'T HEAR YOU 
LET ME THROUGH SORRY YOU TALKING 
SHALL WE CHECK AND SEE WHETHER THE OLD GREENHOUSE IS 
BECAUSE HE COULD PLAY THE THING OUT HERE MAYBE 
I COULD BE BELTING OUT A NUMBER IN HERE ARE YOU READY 
YEAH ER THEY'RE COMPANY 
OF LIFE CAN SEE 
THEN STRIDE 
BELIEVE ME BY D. A. 
OH AND 
IT WORKS I COULDN'T HEAR A THING WHEN THE DOOR WAS SHUT 
AND THAT'S WHY WE KNOW 
GOOD 
I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE MAIN BEDROOM IT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZE 
NO IT IS A GREEN RADIATOR 
THE UPSTAIRS OF THIS HOUSE I'M GOING TO SAY IT IT'S COLOURFUL 
IT'S MORE THAN COLOURFUL THERE'S NOWT WRONG WITH COLOUR IT'S A SPECTRUM OF AMBITION 
THESE ARE LIKE THE PEOPLE AT FESTIVALS WHO WEAR JESTERS' HATS ON THEIR HEADS THEY LOVE COLOUR 
AND UNTIL I COME ALONG SWING COLOURFUL RIBBONS AROUND THEMSELVES 
THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE COLOUR 
NOT FOR THEM THE COLOUR OF TAUPE OR WHITE WITH AN ACCENT WALL BEIGE 
FOR THEM CARNIVAL TIME 
WOW NOW THIS ISN'T SMALL EITHER NO 
AGAIN A REALLY NICE SIZED DOUBLE ROOM 
NO 
IT'S QUITE PATTERNED BUT IT'S BEEN DONE WELL WHICH SUGGESTS TO ME THAT PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AFTER THE HOUSE 
THOSE PATTERNS ARE ALMOST A MOTIF OF CARE FROM THE CURRENT OWNERS 
THEY'VE WANTED TO EMBROIDER EVERY SQUARE INCH WITH A LITTLE BIT OF DECORATIVE DETAILING 
BATHROOM A BATHROOM AND QUITE A NICE BATHROOM ACTUALLY AS WELL 
IT'S WHITE AND NOT PINK YES 
I WONDER IF WE CAN CONFUSE PEOPLE WITH TWO PULL CORDS 
THEY ALREADY GET CONFUSED AS IT IS 
I OFTEN WHEN IN A TOILET WILL ACCIDENTALLY PULL THE WRONG CORD 
AND SET AN ALARM OFF AND NEED TO BE RESCUED FROM THAT TOILET 
THEY'VE GOT ISSUES WITH THE PULL CORDS 
ONE IN THERE IS FOR YOUR POWER SHOWER ONE FOR THE LIGHT 
POWER SHOWER LIGHT COLOUR CODE THEM GET RID OF THAT WHOLE DILEMMA 
MAYBE PINK FOR POWER SHOWER LEMON FOR LIGHT 
PINK POWER SHOWER LEMON LIGHT IT WOULD WORK WOULDN'T IT 
NOW THIS ISN'T A HUGE ROOM 
IT'S NOT A HUGE ROOM 
LOOKING A FEW YEARS DOWN THE LINE MAYBE IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD ROOM FOR A. 
A BABY YOU NEVER KNOW HOLD OFF ON THAT ONE 
GOOD AFTERNOON WE'VE GOT BREAKING NEWS COMING IN LIVE

IT'S GOOD IT'S GOOD 
THE DECOR'S NOT QUITE US BUT THAT'S O. K. WE CAN CHANGE THAT 
HELLO HELLO I HEARD YOU MENTION THE DECOR AND THAT STUFF 
YOU CAN EASILY SOLVE DECOR 
WE'RE IN HERE YOU ARE THE POTENTIAL DEVELOPERS THE PROPERTY LADDER CLIMBERS

WITH THIS 
IS THAT ENOUGH TO SEPARATE OR NOT I THINK SO YEAH 
REALLY YEAH SOLVED WITH A DOOR 
YOU COULD STICK A WALL UP THERE IF YOU WANTED TO YEAH YEAH 
BUT YOU'RE THINKING NOW MAYBE NO 
IT'S REALLY LIGHT AND I QUITE LIKE THE LIGHTNESS IN IT 
IT IS NICE TO BE ABLE TO SIT IN THE FRONT OF THE ROOM AND SEE ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
IT'S A PLUS POINT COME OVER THIS WAY BECAUSE WE HAVE ANOTHER WALL YOU COULD BOARD UP SHOULD YOU WISH TO 
SO HERE SEPARATE KITCHEN BUT WE HAVEN'T GOT ONE WE'VE GOT ALL THIS HAPPENING HERE

I QUITE LIKE IT AS IT IS ACTUALLY YEAH 
SO REALLY YOU QUITE LIKE THE WAY IT'S LAID OUT I THINK IT'S GOOD YEAH 
COULD HAVE IN THEORY CHANGED THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT HOUSING YEAH 
POSSIBLY POSSIBLY MAYBE THAT'S A BRIDGE TOO FAR O. K. 
WE NEED TO GUESS THE PRICE AND THE PLACE WHERE WE GUESS IT IS THAT WAY 
O. K. O. K.

JUST AS YOU'VE GOT USED TO THE IDEA OF OPEN PLAN LIVING 
I'M TAKING YOU BACK TO WHAT YOU ORIGINALLY SAID YOU WANTED 
WHICH IS KIND OF SEPARATE DINING SEPARATE KITCHEN SEPARATE LOUNGE 
SO FIRST IMPRESSIONS WHAT DO WE THINK

IT'S GOT A SHED WHICH IS GOOD YES 
SHED HOW MANY SHEDS 
I'VE GIVEN THEM 
ONE ONE SHED 
I GAVE THEM THAT'S GREEDY 
IS THIS A DINING ROOM

NO I HAVEN'T PUT ANY NOTES UPSTAIRS 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW WHAT TO DO IT'S GOING TO BE FINE THIS IS INTERESTING 
TOP OF THE STAIRS AND A CHOICE AS TO WHICH WAY YOU GO 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK IN THIS ROOM 
SEE CHOICES BEDROOMS GOT THREE DOUBLE BEDROOMS UP THERE HAVE YOU 
I'VE GIVEN THEM A LOT OF SPACE THAT'S VERY LONG AND NARROW 
BUT IT'S GOOD IT'S A GOOD ROOM DO YOU THINK 
THIS IS GOING DOWN WELL ISN'T IT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD CALL 
CALL THE ESTATE AGENT NO 
EXCUSE ME A SECOND APOLOGIES FOR THIS 
HELLO HELLO DEAR SIR JUST WANTING TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT 
YES WE'VE SEEN YOUR NOTES WONDERED IF THERE WERE ANY MORE UPSTAIRS 
GOOD I KNOW THEY WEREN'T VERY ELABORATE NOTES ONE WANTED YOU TO INTERACT IN THE SPACE A BIT 
ASK HIM TO SEE WHERE THEY'D PUT THE BED O. K. 
ED WANTS TO KNOW WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO PUT THE BED 
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING 
THEY COULD BE THE BED YOU COULD LIE ON THE FLOOR AND PRETEND YOU WERE THE BED 
I THINK WE'LL GIVE THAT A TRY THEN 
I'M GLAD I COULD BE OF SOME HELP 
A VERY GOOD SUGGESTION IF WE'RE NOT SURE THAT A BED WILL FIT LET'S LIE DOWN AND TRY 
ALL RIGHT YOU CAN THANK YOU 
NOW NOW NOW THEN NOW THEY'RE SHAKING IT LOOSE AND BEING A BED 
IT WOULD BE TIGHT 
THIS SEEMS LIKE PANTOMIME WHEN PEOPLE START DOING THIS 
BUT IF YOU START HAVING A LAUGH IN A HOUSE AND ENJOYING THE SPACE AND PLAYING WITH IT A BIT 
YOU FEEL MORE AT EASE WITH THE PROPERTY YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT A PHONE DOWNSTAIRS 
GO AND STAND WHERE YOU THINK YOU'D PUT A WARDROBE 
HERE MAYBE 
IF WE WERE A CUPBOARD WE'D BE LIKE THIS BUT WE HAVEN'T GOT THE DEPTH 
SPREAD OUT THAT WAY 
WHEN YOU DO THIS IN A HOUSE IMAGINE YOUR UNDERPANTS AND CLOTHES AND IF THEY WOULD FIT IN 
THERE'S LOTS OF SOCKETS AROUND THE PLACE ODD HEIGHTS BUT THAT'S FINE 
LOVES HIS POWER POINTS DOESN'T HE THAT GUY 
A MAN HE'S A MAN 
THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN SAY TO THAT 
I'M SAYING HE'S A MAN WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF MAN 
LOCATION OF SOCKETS VERY HIGH ON HIS IMPORTANCE LIST MAN 
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED A GOOD SIZED BATHROOM YEAH 
EVERYONE HAS FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE BROKEN POI HAVEN'T THEY 
OUT OF THE WINDOW THEY'VE DECORATED IT WELL 
THEY HAVE IT'S IN A GOOD STATE YEAH 
SHALL WE GO BACK DOWN YES LET'S HEAD BACK DOWN 
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A LOOK IN THE GARAGE 
WELL I RECKON THAT WENT PERFECTLY HOW PERFECTLY I'M GOING TO SAY THEY'RE GOING TO BUY IT 
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BUY MINE ANY MORE 
THEN IN THAT CASE I THINK IT'S TIME FOR ME TO MAKE A CALL CALL THE OLD ESTATE AGENT NO NO NO 
I'M GOING TO CALL MY MUM TO MAKE SURE MY LAUNDRY HAS BEEN DONE 
HELLO MUM IT'S ONLY ME 
THE DOOR DOES FINALLY OPEN JUST A LITTLE BIT STIFF THERE 
PROBABLY NEEDS SOME OIL BUT DON'T LET THAT PUT YOU OFF ME INTRODUCING YOU TO THE GARAGE 
LET ME JUST CLOSE THIS DOOR HERE RIGHT STEP BACK AGAINST THIS 
IT DOESN'T SEEM THE MOST EXCITING PART OF THE HOUSE BUT YOU'VE BEEN GETTING EXCITED ABOUT THE SPACE 
AND THE BEDROOMS AND THE SIZE IT ALL SEEMS TO BE A O. K. YES YEAH O. K. 
SURVEY THIS GARAGE FOR ME WHICH IS AN ADD ON WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WELL YOU COULD USE IT FOR STORING STUFF 
OR YOU COULD POSSIBLY TURN IT INTO A ROOM 
I LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY 
I THINK THIS IS A BIT NARROW FOR A PROPER WORKING GARAGE 
YOU'D DRIVE YOUR CAR IN BUT YOU'D HAVE TO STAY IN YOUR CAR 
COS I'M NOT SURE YOU'D GET YOUR DOORS OPEN WHICH IS AN INTERESTING CONCEPT 
BASICALLY TURNING THIS INTO A ROOM REALLY ISN'T THAT DIFFICULT AT ALL 
ALMOST COMPREHEND THE BEFORE AND AFTER ONCE RENDERED AND PLASTERED AND DECORATED 
AND DOWN THAT END IT'S A CASE OF GETTING PLANNING PERMISSION TO PUT IN A WINDOW 
AND SORTING THAT END UP MAKING IT LOOK LIKE A PROPER ROOM SO THEN YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF 
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH IT THE EXCESS OF ROOMAGE 
A MUSIC ROOM 
WOULD YOU LOCK HIM IN HERE MAYBE YEAH MAYBE WORTH A TRY 
IT'S NOT BAD IS IT 
THE OTHER THING I'VE NOTICED YOU GET VERY EXCITED ABOUT PLUGS

THREE BEDROOMED HOUSE TEN 
THIRTY THREE PLUGS WHILE THAT'S RINGING IN YOUR EARS LET'S GO AND GUESS THE PRICE IN THE OTHER ROOM

GOOD GUESS ANDY 
I THINK THAT THE AREA IS GOING TO TAKE IT UP A BIT MORE SO ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
AND OF COURSE REMEMBER THE TOP OF YOUR BUDGET IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE SO WE'RE RIGHT NEAR THERE 
KRISTIAN KNOWS THE ANSWER O. K. 
SHE GOT IT WRONG 
YOU'RE CLOSEST 
THE PRICE IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
SO YOU WERE VERY CLOSE VERY VERY CLOSE 
I THINK IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN EDWARD'S IF YOU WOULD ALL RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND 
TOUCHING THE TEXTURE OF THE WALL BEHIND YOU 
I THINK YOU'LL REALISE IT'S WELL WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY OF THAT 
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU YOUR POI BACK 
SHALL WE GO TO THE WILD CARD DO YOU THINK WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT 
YES PLEASE THIS WAY THEN 
SO IT'S TIME FOR OUR FINAL OPTION THE WILD CARD AND BOY ARE THEY GOING TO LOVE IT 
CHECK OUT THIS CHEEKY LITTLE THREE BED SEMI JUST SEVENTEEN MILES FROM ANDY'S SCIENCE PARK 
A LITTLE FIRE CRACKER FROM OUTSIDE 
BUT INSIDE IT'S A CASE OF SEEING BEYOND THE DECOR AND IGNITING THEIR DECORATING FUSES 
BECAUSE WITH A LICK OF PAINT AND A NEW SET OF CARPETS THIS PLACE COULD LIGHT UP THEIR LIVES FOREVER 
THE WILD CARD THE WILD CARD EVERYBODY LOVES A WILD CARD 
HERE IT IS DO YOU LOOKS GOOD 
O. K. I THINK THIS IS THE ONE THAT YOU CAN SAY ANDY AND BECKA IN DECORATIVE FORM IN HERE 
IT NEEDS SOME WORK HENCE WILD CARD 
ALSO I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ROAD THERE IS BUSIER TODAY 
BECAUSE THERE'S AN ACCIDENT SOMEWHERE SO IT WON'T ALWAYS BE LIKE THIS 
I THINK I'VE COVERED EVERY BASE KRISTIAN 
I'D LIKE TO SAY I'M REALLY GOOD AT THIS 
AND SECONDLY JUST TO CLARIFY THE DECOR AND STYLE OF THIS HOUSE I KNOW ISN'T GOING TO BE TO YOUR LIKING 
IT'S MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO DO TO IT AND HOW YOU CAN MAKE IT YOURS 
SO WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE CAN I HAVE THE OTHER POI PLEASE 
OFF YOU GO IT'S ALL YOURS NOW GO ON IN THE HOUSE 
IN THE HOUSE OFF YOU GO GO ON OFF YOU GO MARVELLOUS GO ON I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE NEAR HIM OW 
I'VE LOST MY JAW QUICK HEADPHONES LET'S GO OUT THE BACK OW 
HAVE YOU MASTERED THAT YET 
OH ABSOLUTELY LOOK AT THAT WHAT CONTROL I'VE GOT 
GOOD I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE 
BUT I THINK THIS MIGHT WELL BE THE DRAGON'S DEN THEY BREATHE FIRE 
THAT THEY END UP 
COULD YOU UNSTITCH ME PLEASE YES 
IT'S A GOOD SPACE IT IS 
THEY ALWAYS LIKE THE HALLS DON'T THEY THEY'RE BIG ON THEIR HALLS 
ED AND KRISTIAN ARE RIGHT IT DOES NEED A BIT OF WORK DOING 
WE WEREN'T LYING WE WERE HONEST 
WE WERE HONEST WHAT'S THIS WAY 
I LIKE THAT IT'S OPEN AND YOU CAN KIND OF HAVE BOTH BUT YOU CAN STILL SHUT THE DOORS 
IT'S NOT SEPARATE LIVING BUT IT'S NOT OPEN PLAN LIVING 
ALL IN ONE YOU SEE WITH THOSE PINE SLAT DOORS LIKE THAT 
SIZE WISE IT'S A NICE SIZED ROOM ISN'T IT MM 
I MEAN THERE'S A LOT THAT YOU COULD DO WITH IT 
TAKE DOWN THE TILES ON THE CEILING I THINK WOULD BE NUMBER ONE 
LET'S LOOK AT THE LIVING ROOM 
IT'S GOOD THAT IT'S AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND LOOKS OVER THE GARDEN 
YOU PREFER THAT I THINK I DO REVERSE DOWNSTAIRS LIVING 
BECAUSE YOU WOULD ORDINARILY PUT YOUR SOFA BY YOUR BAY WINDOW BUT HERE THE VENDORS HAVE 
AND ANDY'S LEARNT SOMETHING ABOUT BECKA THERE 
DIDN'T REALISE THAT BEFORE DID HE 
NO I THINK I'D PROBABLY BE INCLINED TO OPEN THIS UP A BIT MORE AS WELL 
THE COUPLE THAT WERE ANTI OPEN PLAN LIVING WHO WERE PHOBIC ABOUT OPEN SPACES 
ALMOST AGORAPHOBIC OF LIVING SPACES THAT WERE OPEN PLAN NOW NOW 
I MADE A MISTAKE WITH PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
I SHOWED THEM OPEN SPACE LIVING THEY THOUGHT THIS IS ALL RIGHT ACTUALLY 
TAKE THE GAS FIRE OUT AGAIN I THINK YEAH 
WHAT HAS HE GOT AGAINST FIRES THAT FELLA 
CONSIDERING HIS HOBBY IS PLAYING WITH FIRE 
IS WHOOFF HE'S VERY JUDGMENTAL ABOUT A FIREPLACE ISN'T HE 
RIGHT KITCHEN OH 
YES I THINK THEY MIGHT COME DOWN 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I WAS GOING TO SAY QUITE SMALL BUT IT OPENS OUT AT THE END DOESN'T IT IT GETS QUITE LONG 
IF YOU CLEAR AWAY THE CLUTTER THERE IS A VERY NICE KITCHEN AT ONE END 
BEGGING TO GET OUT NO IT'S THERE YOU COULD HAVE A BREAKFAST AREA 
COME ON BECKA HMM THEN YOU COULD ACTUALLY COOK DOWN THERE YEAH 
AND KIND OF PLAY AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE BIT 
BECKA'S GOT IT SUSSED YOU CAN'T SEE THE WOOD FOR THE BAY LEAVES 
THE GARDEN LOOKS INTERESTING GREENHOUSE YES 
O. K. TWO REASONS TO BUY THE GARDEN GO ON 
A COCK AND AN OWL DOES IT FOR ME 
DOES IT FOR ME COCK A HOOP 
I THINK IT LOOKS REALLY INTERESTING I'D LIKE TO LOOK UPSTAIRS 
COME ON WHAT HAVE YOU GOT 
THIS IS THE ONE 
I THINK THAT SAYS IT ALL 
YEAH I'M NOT SURE IF I FANCY THE LACK OF STUFF OVER THIS SIDE 
WHAT YOU THINK YOU'LL FALL OFF YOU NEVER KNOW 
I THINK JASPER WOULD BE INCLINED TO JUMP FROM A HEIGHT ONTO PEOPLE 
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE HANDRAILS ABOUT JASPER THE CAT DIVING DOWN THERE 
I HAVE FORGED A DOCUMENTARY ON CAT SURVIVAL FROM JUMPS OF THAT HEIGHT 
OF COURSE THEY CAN SURVIVE 
OF COURSE THEY CAN SEVENTH FLOOR IS THE KILLER FOR CATS 
IF YOU'RE ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR NEVER LEAVE YOUR WINDOW OPEN 
BECAUSE JUST WHEN THEY REALISE THEY'RE FALLING THEY TENSE AND THAT'S WHEN THEY HIT THE GROUND 
EIGHTH FLOOR THEY'RE FINE SIXTH FLOOR THEY'RE FINE 
SEVENTH FLOOR ZZPPP 
I QUITE LIKE THIS QUITE HIGH CEILINGS AGAIN WHICH IS GOOD WOODCHIP ON THE WALL 
A PAIN BUT IT'S NOT A BIG PROBLEM 
WE'LL GET THAT OFF WITH A BIT OF SCRAPING 
THIS HOUSE NEEDS A LOT OF SCRAPING YOU'VE GOT THE WOOD CHIP TO GO THE POLYSTYRENE TILES AND 
I THINK THAT'S IT ASBESTOS GARAGE YEAH YOU COULD SCRAPE AT THAT PROBABLY GET RID OF THAT 
NOT A BAD SIZE IS IT 
YES YOU COULD GET A DOUBLE BED IN HERE YOU COULD 
I'M BEING A PEST I'M JUST LOOKING FOR POWER SOCKETS 
HE'S ALWAYS LOOKING FOR POWER SOCKETS I LOVE THAT MAN 
I LOOK FOR POWER SOCKETS 
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY POWER SOCKETS ARE IN THIS HOUSE I DO 
THERE'S TWENTY THREE NO THERE'S NOT THERE'S FORTY THREE 
NO THERE'S NOT FORTY THREE THERE'S NOT

THERE CAN'T BE MORE MY HOUSE HAD THIRTY THREE PLUG SOCKETS THIS CAN'T HAVE MORE 
OH IS THAT POWER SOCKET ENVY WELL YOU CAN MOVE HERE HERE IN WOLVERHAMPTON 
THE ONLY THING I WANT TO SOCK IT RIGHT NOW IS YOU 
HEY I DIDN'T PUT THEM IN I'M NOT THE ONE WHO OWNS THE SOCKETS FORTY THREE 
O. K. THIRD BEDROOM 
NOT VERY BIG NO 
BIG ENOUGH FOR A DOUBLE BED OR NOT 
OH YOU MIGHT JUST ABOUT MANAGE IT 
I WAS TOLD BY A RATHER SEXY ESTATE AGENT WITH A RED CAR 
THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH BOX ROOMS IN THE OLD PROPERTIES ROUND HERE 
TELL ME ABOUT THIS LADY THAT YOU MET 
IT WAS A SEXY MAN CALLED NICK AND LADIES HE IS STILL AVAILABLE 
THAT'S THE TOILET 
ON ITS OWN WITH A SINK NO NO SINK

I THOUGHT THIS ONE MIGHT DO 
TO CLINCH IT TO MAKE SURE THEY REALLY REALLY FALL IN LOVE 
WHAT WILL YOU DO I'LL INTRODUCE THEM TO THIS FELLA 
IT MIGHT JUST WORK 
O. K. SO YOU HAD A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE HOUSE 
DIDN'T VENTURE OUT IN THE GARDEN 
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE WE WERE OUT HERE 
ANDY JUST HAVE A LITTLE LOOK IN THERE GO ON 
REPORT BACK AS SOON AS YOU'VE DONE THAT 
YEAH THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF SPACE QUITE A LOT OF SPACE 
THERE'S A CAR IN THERE PARKED TIGHT UP AGAINST ONE OF THE PIPES 
SO I'M THINKING WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T PARK A CAR IN THERE IS THE RIGHT ANSWER 
I THINK THAT A LOT OF THIS NEEDS TO COME DOWN 
AND BE THOUGHT ABOUT AGAIN 
ABOUT SPACE PLANNING WASHING LINE ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF REWORK THAT 
BUT WHAT YOU HAVE GOT IS A REALLY NICE GARDEN HERE ON TWO LEVELS 
AND PERSONALLY FOR ME IT'S ALL THERE IT'S ALL DONE 
NICE SELECTION OF GARDEN GNOMES NOT INCLUDED IN THE ASKING PRICE 
BUT IF YOU SPEAK TO THE VENDOR NICELY WHO KNOWS 
THIS COULD BE YOURS WHAT DO YOU THINK 
DO YOU FEEL AT HOME NOW DO YOU FEEL SPECIAL WELCOME 
IS IT DOING IT FOR YOU YOU LOOK HORRIFIED 
SEE I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS DARN CUTE 
OH IT'S JUST LOVELY IT IS LOVELY 
OBVIOUSLY THE HOUSE DOES NEED WORK LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THIS

HERE'S A RECAP FOR YOU AT HOME 
WILL THEY BE PUTTING THE KEYS INTO THE TEMPTING DOOR OF MY CHOICE 
THAT CHEEKY SEMI WITH FOUR SHEDS A GREENHOUSE 
A LIVING FLAME GAS FIRE AND A DOWNSTAIRS TOILET 
ALL FOR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BE MY HOUSE 
THAT SPARKLY NEW RECENTLY EXTENDED SEMI DETACHED 
IT'S READY TO MOVE INTO AND THEY GET A GARAGE ALL FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
OR WILL THEY SURPRISE US BOTH 
AND PICK OUR WILD WILD WILD CARD THAT SEMI WITH ATTITUDE 
THEY GET ACRES OF SPACE IF THEY FANCIED A BIT OF DECORATING 
AND FORTY THREE PLUG SOCKETS ALL FOR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WELL THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT 
RIGHT PROPERTY NUMBER ONE SO WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IT'S GOOD I LIKE IT IT'S GOT A LOT OF SPACE A CONSERVATORY AS WELL 
YEAH THAT WAS A DEFINITE BONUS 
IT DIDN'T NEED A LOT OF WORK JUST DECORATING 
DECENT SIZED BEDROOMS AS WELL 
THAT THIRD BEDROOM I THINK IS PROBABLY THE SMALLEST OF ALL OF THEM 
PROPERTY NUMBER TWO MY LEAST FAVOURITE 
I THINK YEAH I THINK THE LOCATION A LITTLE BIT FURTHER OUT YEAH 
AND PRETTY MUCH FINISHED AS WELL AND THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WE WANT 
WE WANT TO TAKE SOMETHING ON AND DO WORK TO IT 
THOUGH THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY OF THE GARAGE TRUE 
PROPERTY NUMBER THREE NEEDS WORK NOT A BAD THING 
YEAH COULD BE GOOD LOTS OF POTENTIAL MM HMM 
COULD BE INTERESTING 
INTERESTING DECENT SIZED KITCHEN AS WELL 
TEST DRIVE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I THINK PROPERTY NUMBER THREE 
I THINK THE WILD CARD AS WELL O. K. YEAH 
THE WILD CARD THE WILD CARD THEY DID INDEED CHOOSE THE WILD CARD 
HOLD ON ONE FIRE BREATHING MOMENT 
THEY CAN'T GO IN THERE BEFORE THEY GET THE LOW DOWN ON HIS HOUSE FROM TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY'S OWN SURVEYOR 
HE'S POKED HIS NOSE AROUND THIS SEMI SENSATION AND POINTED OUT A FEW THINGS TO CONSIDER 
OH YES BUT OF COURSE THIS SURVEY IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING 
AND WE ALWAYS RECOMMEND GETTING AN INDEPENDENT SURVEY OF YOUR OWN 
BEFORE SIGNING ON THE DOTTED LINE 
FIRST UP THOSE POLYSTYRENE CEILING TILES WOULD HAVE TO GO 
NOWADAYS THEY ARE OUTLAWED BY BUILDING REGULATIONS AS THEY ARE WAIT FOR IT A FIRE HAZARD 
IMAGINE ONE DAY THE FIRE BREATHING GOT OUT OF HAND 
THE TILES WOULD MELT LET OFF TOXIC FUMES AND SPLATTER HOT MOLTEN PLASTIC EVERYWHERE 
WHICH AS WELL AS BREACHING HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS WOULD ALSO RUIN YOUR POI COLLECTION 
OUR SURVEYOR ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE HOUSE HAS WHAT IS KNOWN IN THE TRADE AS A HIPPED ROOF 
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN IT NEEDS A REPLACEMENT 
IT'S CONSTRUCTED IN THE SHAPE OF A PYRAMID 
WHICH MEANS FUTURE LOFT CONVERSIONS MIGHT BE TRICKY 
THAT'S IT ON YOUR BIKE EXCUSE ME 
ON YOUR BIKE THE BEST WAY TO CHECK OUT YOUR PROSPECTIVE NEIGHBOURHOOD PEDAL POWER 
BREATHING FIRE IN THE FRONT GARDEN HE'S GOT SOME FRONT 
M. M. M. A WARM ONE I EXPECT 
POI TIME YES YES I CAN DO THAT TOO I BEG TO DIFFER 
HE'S STROKING THAT WOOD PANEL ED 
I THINK HE MUST HAVE RUN OUT OF MATCHES 
HE MUST HAVE HE'S EVEN GOT BECKA LOOKING FOR THE PILOT LIGHT 
MORE GREAT MAN STUFF THAT'S IT 
STRIDE AROUND THE GARAGE TRYING IT FOR SIZE 
AND LAUGH IN THE FACE OF FROZEN TAPS WITH YOUR FIERY BREATH 
GUITAR FIRE BREATHING MOUNTAIN BIKES HOW MANY HOBBIES DOES ONE MAN NEED 
SHUSH YOU'RE RUINING IT 
TIME TO ASK THE QUESTION TO FRY OR NOT TO FRY 
BECKA AND ANDY YOU HAVE BRRM BRMM TEST DRIVEN THE PROPERTY 
FIRSTLY WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THIS ONE 
WELL IT SHOWED THE MOST POTENTIAL FOR US TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING TO MAKE A BIT OF MONEY POTENTIALLY 
AND TO SORT OF PUT OFF A MARK ON IT 
AND BECKA YOU'RE NOT SCARED BY THE AMOUNT OF WORK AND DECORATING AND SANDING AND SCRAPING AND PAINTING 
NO WE LIKE A CHALLENGE YOU LIKE A CHALLENGE YEAH TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION 
NOT TO BUY NOT TO BUY 
NOT TO BUY NOT TO BUY NOT TO BUY 
CAN I ASK ANOTHER QUESTION 
WHAT'S NOT TO BUY 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT FURTHER OUT THAN WE WANTED TO BE 
AND IT'S A GOOD HOUSE BUT IT'S NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
GOOD BUT NOT THAT GOOD YEAH 
O. K. IT'S INSPIRED THEM THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME 
TAKE THAT AS A POSITIVE YES GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR HOUSE HUNTING 
I APOLOGISE THAT WE HAVEN'T MANAGED TO DO IT TODAY 
GIVE US ANOTHER GO YOU AND I 
A BIT OF FIRE BREATHING MM HMM 
SEE YOU SEE YOU LATER ON BYE BYE 
I CAN'T MASK MY DISAPPOINTMENT KRISTIAN NO 
WE DIDN'T FIND THE DRAGONS A DEN 
YOU LOOK VERY DOWNHEARTED OF COURSE LOOK AT THIS FACE YOU SHOULDN'T BE 
I ALWAYS BELIEVE STRONGLY THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING GOOD TO TAKE AWAY FROM EVERY EXPERIENCE 
WHAT GOOD WHAT GOOD 
IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING TO FIND A DREAM HOME 
I'M GOOD AT THIS WHAT IS THAT CALLED 
OH IT'S CALLED THE INCREDIBLE TANGLE OFF WE GO 
THIS IS NO ORDINARY PROPERTY SHOW 
COULD INFLAME YOUR PROPERTY TEMPER TO BOILING POINT 
AND LEAD YOU UP THE PESKY PROPERTY LADDER 
WHO WRITES THAT 
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT THOUGHT THAT I COULDN'T BREATHE FIRE
