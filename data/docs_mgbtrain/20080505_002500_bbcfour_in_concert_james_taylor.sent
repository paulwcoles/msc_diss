LEND ME YOUR EARS AND I'LL SING YOU A SONG 
LORD I'LL TRY NOT TO SING OUT OF KEY 
I GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
I'M GONNA TRY WITH THE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
I GET HIGH WITH THE HELP FROM MY GOOD FRIENDS 
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR LOVE IS AWAY 
DOES IT WORRY YOU TO BE ON YOUR OWN 
AND HOW DO YOU FEEL TOWARDS THE END OF A DAY 
ARE YOU SAD BECAUSE YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN 
NO I GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
I'M GONNA TRY WITH THE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
I GET HIGH WITH THE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
DO YOU NEED ANYBODY 
WELL I MUST SAY THAT I DO NEED ME SOMEONE TO LOVE 
COULD IT BE ANYBODY 
WHOA LORD I JUST NEED ME SOMEONE TO LOVE 
SOMEONE TO LOVE 
DO YOU BELIEVE IN A LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT 
YES I'M CERTAIN THAT IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME 
AND WHAT DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU TURN OUT THE LIGHT 
I CAN'T TELL YOU BUT IT SURE ENOUGH MUST BE MINE 
LORD I GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
I GET HIGH WITH THE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
I JUST MAY DIE WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
I GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
THE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS 
COME ALONG NOW WON'T YOU HELP ME MY FRIEND 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I KNOW THIS SHOW IS SUPPOSED TO BE CALLED JAMES TAYLOR SINGS JAMES TAYLOR 
AND SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT THAT SONG WAS WRITTEN BY MESSRS. LENNON AND MCCARTNEY OF 
OF THE FOUR SINGING BEATLES A ROCK AND ROLL ENSEMBLE FROM LIVERPOOL 
IT WAS AT ANY RATE ANYHOW THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SONGS SO I THOUGHT I'D OPEN WITH IT 
THAT WAS MY OPENING NUMBER 
I'D LIKE TO SWING RIGHT OUT OF THAT TUNE AND JUMP RIGHT INTO THE NEXT ONE 
A SONG I WROTE MYSELF 
MOSTLY HERE AND PARTIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES TOO 
JUST YESTERDAY MORNING THEY LET ME KNOW YOU WERE GONE 
SUZANNE THE PLANS THEY MADE PUT AN END TO YOU 
I WALKED OUT ON THE MORNING AND I WROTE DOWN THIS SONG 
I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER WHO TO SEND IT TO 
I'VE SEEN FIRE AND I'VE SEEN RAIN 
I'VE SEEN SUNNY DAYS THAT I THOUGHT WOULD NEVER END 
I'VE SEEN LONELY TIMES WHEN I COULD NOT FIND A FRIEND 
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I'D SEE YOU AGAIN 
WON'T YOU LOOK DOWN UPON ME JESUS YOU GOTTA HELP ME TO MAKE A STAND 
YOU JUST GOT TO SEE ME THROUGH ANOTHER DAY 
MY BODY'S ACHING AND MY TIME IS AT HAND 
AND I WON'T MAKE IT ANY OTHER WAY 
I'VE SEEN FIRE AND I'VE SEEN RAIN 
I'VE SEEN SUNNY DAYS THAT I THOUGHT WOULD NEVER END 
I'VE SEEN LONELY TIMES WHEN I COULD NOT FIND A FRIEND 
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I'D SEE YOU AGAIN 
I'VE BEEN WALKING MY MIND TO AN EASY TIME 
WITH MY BACK TURNED TOWARDS THE SUN 
LORD KNOWS WHEN THE COLD WIND BLOWS IT'LL TURN YOUR HEAD AROUND NOW 
THERE'S HOURS OF TIME ON THE TELEPHONE LINE 
TO TALK ABOUT THINGS TO COME 
SWEET DREAMS AND FLYING MACHINES IN PIECES ON THE GROUND 
WHOA NOW I'VE SEEN FIRE AND I'VE SEEN RAIN 
I'VE SEEN SUNNY DAYS THAT I THOUGHT WOULD NEVER END 
I'VE SEEN LONELY TIMES WHEN I COULD NOT FIND A FRIEND 
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I'D SEE YOU SOMEHOW 
ONE MORE TIME AGAIN NOW 
I THOUGHT I'D SEE YOU ONE MORE TIME AGAIN 
THERE'S JUST A FEW THINGS COMING MY WAY THIS TIME AROUND FOR NOW 
I THOUGHT I'D SEE YOU I THOUGHT I'D SEE YOU FIRE AND RAIN 
LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA 
LA LA LA LA LA 
THANK YOU YOU'RE TOO KIND 
WHAT GOOD IS YOUR HAPPY LIE 
ALL YOU WANTED FROM THE START WAS TO CRY NOW 
IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER FALL 
YOUR GOOD FRIENDS THEY DON'T SEEM TO HELP AT ALL NOW 
WHEN YOU'RE FEELING KIND OF COLD AND SMALL 
JUST CALL ON YOUR RAINY DAY MAN 
IT DOES YOU NO GOOD TO PRETEND CHILD 
YOU'VE MADE A HOLE MUCH TOO BIG TO MEND NOW 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU LOSE AGAIN MY FRIEND 
SO CALL ON YOUR RAINY DAY MAN 
I SAID RAINY DAY MAN DON'T LIKE SUNSHINE 
HE DON'T CHASE NO RAINBOWS 
HE DON'T NEED GOOD TIMES 
GREY DAYS ROLLING THEN YOU'LL SEE HIM 
EMPTY FEELING LORD NOW YOU NEED HIM 
ALL THOSE NOBLE THOUGHTS THEY DON'T BELONG 
YOU CAN'T HIDE THE TRUTH WITH A HAPPY SONG 
AND SINCE YOU KNEW WHERE YOU STOOD ALL ALONG 
TIME TO GO ON HOME AND CALL ON YOUR RAINY DAY MAN 
NOW SIMPLE PLEASURES THEY ALL EVADE YOU 
STORE BOUGHT TREASURES NONE CAN SAVE YOU NO NOW 
LOOK FOR SIGNS TO EASE THE PAIN 
ASK AGAIN CHILD PRAY FOR RAIN AND 
IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER FALL 
YOUR FRIENDS THEY DON'T SEEM TO HELP AT ALL 
WHEN YOU'RE FEELING KIND OF COLD AND SMALL NOW 
JUST CALL ON YOUR RAINY DAY MAN 
ALL I NEED IS JUST TO LOOK UP MY RAINY DAY MAN

AT THAT TIME THERE WERE A LOT OF SO CALLED BLUES GROUPS IN NEW YORK CITY Y'KNOW 
AH THEY WEREN'T VERY GOOD THEY WERE MOSTLY WHITE KIDS IN FROM THE SUBURBS 
WITH ELECTRIC GUITARS AND AMPLIFIERS THAT THEIR PARENTS HAD BOUGHT THEM 
FOR CHRISTMAS AND THEIR BIRTHDAYS AND STUFF 
AND THEIR IDEA OF SOUL WAS VOLUME THEY'D JUST CRANK IT UP Y'KNOW 
AND THEY WERE SINGING ALL THESE HEAVY SONGS LIKE I'M A MAN 
OR I'M A JACKHAMMER OR I'M A STEAMSHIP OR WHATEVER 
I'M THE QUEEN MARY OR 
I'M A TON OF BRICKS 
WE WEREN'T TO BE LEFT OUT OF ALL THIS SO I WROTE THIS NEXT SONG

STEAMROLLER BLU U. U. UES

GREENSLEEVES 
LITTLE THING I WROTE MYSELF 
THAT WAS A LITTLE INSTRUMENTAL NUMBER FOR YOU 
THIS IS A PIANO 
IT'S AN AMERICAN FOLK INSTRUMENT 
EIGHTY EIGHT KEYS KIND OF LIKE THE GUITAR 
I RECENTLY LEARNED TWO CHORDS ON THE PIANO 
AND I'VE WRITTEN A SONG CALLED BACK ON THE HIGHWAY 
OR HIGHWAY SONG OR SOMETHING 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT COPYRIGHTED 
THERE'S A MAN FROM APPLE BLACKWOOD BACK THERE IN THE AUDIENCE GOING CRAZY 
I'M THINKING BOUT A BROKEN HEART 
NOW I'M THINKING BOUT THE BREAK OF DAWN 
AND IF YOU'LL LOVE ME WHILE I'M HERE 
THEN YOU CAN MISS ME WHEN I'M GONE 
SWEET MISUNDERSTANDING WON'T YOU LEAVE A POOR BOY ALONE 
COS I'M THE ONE EYED SEED OF A TUMBLEWEED 
IN THE BELLY OF A ROLLING STONE 
BACK ON THE HIGHWAY YEAH YEAH YEAH 
BACK ON THE ROAD AGAIN 
I HAD A LITTLE WOMAN IN MEMPHIS 
SHE WANTED TO BE MY BRIDE 
SHE SAID SETTLE ON DOWN TRAVELLING MAN 
YOU CAN STAY RIGHT BY MY SIDE 
WELL I TRIED SO HARD TO PLEASE HER 
BUT I COULDN'T HOLD OUT TOO LONG 
COS ONE SATURDAY NIGHT I WAS LAYING IN BED 
AND I HEARD THAT HIGHWAY SONG 
BACK ON THE HIGHWAY YEAH YEAH YEAH NOW 
BACK ON THE ROAD AGAIN 
NOW ONE OF THESE DAYS THAT HIGHWAY SONG 
IS GONNA LOSE ITS APPEAL TO ME 
I'M GONNA SETTLE ON DOWN LIKE A NATURAL BORN MAN 
I'M GONNA LIVE MY LIFE NATURALLY FREE AND EASY 
UNTIL THAT DAY WHEN THE THUNDER ROLLS 
AND I NOTICE THERE'S A SIGN OF RAIN 
I'M GONNA PACK MY BAGS AND GRAB MY CLOTHES 
AND I'M BACK ON THE ROAD AGAIN 
BACK ON THE HIGHWAY YEAH WHOA NOW 
BACK ON THE ROAD AGAIN NOW 
THINKING BOUT A BROKEN HEART 
THINKING BOUT THE BREAK OF DAWN 
AND IF YOU LOVE ME WHILE I'M HERE THEN YOU CAN MISS ME WHEN I'M GONE 
I SAID SWEET MISUNDERSTANDING 
WON'T YOU LEAVE A POOR BOY ALONE 
COS I'M THE ONE EYED SEED OF A TUMBLEWEED 
IN THE BELLY OF A ROLLING STONE 
BACK ON THE HIGHWAY YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH NOW 
BACK ON THE ROAD AGAIN 
HERE I AM AGAIN HOLIDAY INN 
SAME OLD FOUR WALLS AGAIN 
GEE BUT IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK HOME AGAIN 
HOLIDAY INN 
BACK ON THE ROAD AGAIN 
THAT'S ALL I KNOW ON THE PIANO 
IT'S A NICE PIANO THOUGH 
THERE'S A LOT LEFT 
LET ME SEE 
CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
HEY RIGHT 
O. K. 
THIS IS A SONG I WROTE IN SPAIN PARTIALLY THERE AND PARTIALLY HERE 
I I WAS HOMESICK AT THE TIME 
I DIDN'T HAVE A HOME BUT THAT DOESN'T KEEP YOU 
FROM BEING HOMESICK SOMETIMES 
BUT ERM I WROTE THIS TUNE 
THIS NEXT ONE RIGHT HERE 
I DEVISED A LITTLE WHISTLING INTRODUCTION FOR IT 
HOPE YOU LIKE IT 
HOT DOG 
IN MY MIND I'M GONE TO CAROLINA 
CAN'T YOU SEE THE SUNSHINE 
WELL CAN'T YOU JUST FEEL THE MOONSHINE 
AND AIN'T IT JUST LIKE A FRIEND OF MINE 
TO HIT ME FROM BEHIND YES I'M GONE TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
KAREN SHE'S A SILVER SUN 
YOU'D BEST WALK HER WAY AND WATCH IT SHININ' 
WATCH HER WATCH THE MORNIN' COME 
A SILVER TEAR APPEARING NOW I'M CRYIN' AIN'T I 
SAID I'M GONE TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
THERE AIN'T NO DOUBT IN NO ONE'S MIND 
THAT LOVE'S THE FINEST THING AROUND 
WHISPER SOMETHING SOFT AND KIND 
AND HEY BABE THE SKY'S ON FIRE I'M DYIN' AIN'T I 
SAID I'M GONE TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
IN MY MIND I'M GONE TO CAROLINA 
CAN'T YOU SEE THE SUNSHINE 
CAN'T YOU JUST FEEL THE MOONSHINE 
AND AIN'T IT JUST LIKE A FRIEND OF MINE 
TO HIT ME FROM BEHIND YES I'M GONE TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
DARK AND SILENT LATE LAST NIGHT 
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE HEARD THE HIGHWAY CALLING 
GEESE IN FLIGHT AND DOGS THAT BITE 
AND SIGNS THAT MIGHT BE OMENS SAY I'M GOING 
YES I GOTTA BE GOING 
I'M GONE TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
NOW WITH A HOLY HOST OF OTHERS STANDING AROUND ME 
STILL I'M ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT GOES ON LIKE THIS FOREVER 
YOU MUST FORGIVE ME 
IF I'M UP AND GONE TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
IN MY MIND I'M GONE TO CAROLINA 
SEE THE SUNSHINE LORD 
AND CAN'T YOU JUST FEEL THE MOONSHINE YEAH 
AND AIN'T IT JUST LIKE A FRIEND OF MINE 
TO HIT ME FROM BEHIND 
YES I'M GONE TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
SAID I'M GONE TO CAROLINA IN MY MIND 
I BETTER GET MYSELF ON HOME AGAIN REAL SOON 
I'D LIKE TO PLAY YOU A NEW SONG 
AH 
IT HASN'T GOT A TITLE YET 
IT'S SORT OF A CYCLICAL THING Y'KNOW MUSICALLY 
IT'S ABOUT NOT ALWAYS GETTING WHAT YOU WANT 
LONG AGO A YOUNG MAN SITS 
AND PLAYS HIS WAITING GAME 
BUT THINGS ARE NOT THE SAME IT SEEMS 
AS IN SUCH TENDER DREAMS 
SLOWLY PASSING SAILING SHIPS 
AND SUNDAY AFTERNOON 
LIKE PEOPLE ON THE MOON I SEE 
ARE THINGS NOT MEANT TO BE 
WHERE DO THE GOLDEN RAINBOWS END 
WHY IS THIS SONG SO SAD 
DREAMING THE DREAMS I'VE DREAMED MY FRIENDS 
LOVING THE LOVE I LOVE TO 
LOVE IS JUST A WORD I'VE HEARD 
WHEN THINGS ARE BEING SAID 
STORIES MY POOR HEAD HAS TOLD ME 
CANNOT STAND THE COLD 
AND IN BETWEEN WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
AND WHAT HAS COME TO PASS 
A MISBEGOTTEN GUESS ALAS 
AND BITS OF BROKEN GLASS 
WHERE DO THE GOLDEN RAINBOWS END 
AND WHY IS THIS SONG SO SAD 
DREAMING THE DREAMS I'VE DREAMED MY FRIEND 
LOVING THE LOVE I LOVE 
TO LOVE TO LOVE TO LOVE TO LOVE 
LA LA LA LA LA LA 
LA LA LA 
IT HASN'T GOT AN ENDING YET EITHER 
WELL 
WELL THERE IS A YOUNG COWBOY HE LIVES ON THE RANGE 
HIS HORSE AND HIS CATTLE ARE HIS ONLY COMPANIONS 
HE WORKS IN THE SADDLE AND HE SLEEPS IN THE CANYONS 
JUST AWAITING FOR SUMMER HIS PASTURES TO CHANGE 
AND AS THE MOON RISES HE SITS BY HIS FIRE 
THINKING ABOUT WOMEN AND GLASSES OF BEER 
AND CLOSING HIS EYES AS THE DOGIES RETIRE 
HE SINGS OUT A SONG WHICH IS SOFT BUT IT'S CLEAR 
AS IF MAYBE SOMEONE COULD HEAR 
HE SAYS GOODNIGHT YOU MOONLIGHT LADIES 
ROCK A BYE MY SWEET BABY JAMES 
DEEP GREENS AND BLUES ARE THE COLOURS I CHOOSE 
WON'T YOU LET ME GO DOWN IN MY DREAMS 
YES AND ROCK A BYE SWEET BABY JAMES 
NOW THE FIRST OF DECEMBER IT WAS COVERED WITH SNOW 
YES AND SO WAS THE TURNPIKE FROM STOCKBRIDGE TO BOSTON 
LORD THE BERKSHIRES SEEMED DREAM LIKE 
ON ACCOUNT OF THAT FROSTING 
WITH TEN MILES BEHIND ME AND TEN THOUSAND MORE TO GO 
THERE'S A SONG THAT THEY SING WHEN THEY TAKE TO THE HIGHWAY 
A SONG THAT THEY SING WHEN THEY TAKE TO THE SEA 
THERE'S A SONG THAT THEY SING OF THEIR HOME IN THE SKY 
AND MAYBE YOU CAN BELIEVE IT IF IT HELPS YOU TO SLEEP 
BUT SINGING SEEMS TO WORK FINE FOR ME 
SO GOODNIGHT YOU MOONLIGHT LADIES 
ROCK A BYE MY SWEET BABY JAMES 
DEEP GREENS AND BLUES ARE THE COLOURS I CHOOSE 
WON'T YOU LET ME GO DOWN IN MY DREAMS 
IT'S TIME TO ROCK A BYE SWEET BABY JAMES 
HERE'S A TUNE CALLED RIDIN' ON A RAILROAD 
WE ARE RIDING NOW 
ON A RAILROAD 
SINGING SOMEONE ELSE'S SONG 
WE BEEN STANDING BY THE CROSSROADS 
TAKE YOUR SIDE AND STEP ALONG 
WE ARE SAILING AWAY ON A RIVER TO THE SEA 
AND MAYBE YOU AND ME WE'LL MEET AGAIN 
WHOA WE'VE BEEN RIDING NOW 
ON A RAILROAD 
SINGING SOMEONE ELSE'S SONG SING ALONG 
TIME TO TIME I TIRE OF THE LIFE THAT I'VE BEEN LEADING 
TOWN TO TOWN AND DAY BY DAY 
AND THERE'S A MAN UP HERE WHO CLAIMS 
TO HAVE HIS HANDS UPON THE REINS 
WELL THERE ARE CHAINS UPON THOSE HANDS 
AND HE'S RIDING UPON A TRAIN 
WHOA LORD WE ARE RIDING ON A RAILROAD 
SINGING SOMEONE ELSE'S SONG 
WE'VE BEEN STANDING NOW STANDING DOWN BY THE CROSSROADS 
TAKE YOUR SIDE AND STEP ALONG 
WE'VE BEEN SAILING AWAY 
ON A RIVER TO THE SEA 
AND MAYBE YOU AND ME WE'LL MEET AGAIN 
WE BEEN A RIDING NOW 
UPON A RAILROAD 
SINGING SOMEONE ELSE'S SONG 
LA LA LA LA LA LA LA 
LA LA LA LA 
LA LA LA LA LA LA 
LA LA LA LA LA 
SINGING SOMEONE ELSE'S SONG 
WELL THE SUN IS SURELY SINKING DOWN 
BUT THE MOON IS SLOWLY RISING 
SO THIS OLD WORLD MUST STILL BE SPINNING ROUND 
AND I STILL LOVE YOU 
SO CLOSE YOUR EYES 
YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR EYES IT'S ALL RIGHT 
I DON'T KNOW NO LOVE SONGS 
AND I CAN'T SING THE BLUES ANY MORE 
BUT I CAN SING THIS SONG 
AND YOU CAN SING THIS SONG WHEN I'M GONE 
IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE ANOTHER DAY 
WE GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME 
AND NO ONE'S GONNA TAKE THAT TIME AWAY 
YOU CAN STAY AS LONG AS YOU LIKE 
SO CLOSE YOUR EYES 
YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR EYES IT'S ALL RIGHT 
I DON'T KNOW NO LOVE SONGS 
AND I CAN'T SING THE BLUES ANY MORE 
BUT I CAN SING THIS SONG 
AND YOU CAN SING THIS SONG WHEN I'M GONE
