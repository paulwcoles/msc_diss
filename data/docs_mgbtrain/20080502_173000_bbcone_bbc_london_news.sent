BEING COUNTED KEEPING AN EYE ON 
THINGS TIM DONOVAN 
THIS IS WHERE 
WE WILL SEE AND HEAR IT WHEN IT 
HAPPENS OFFICIALLY ALREADY ALL OF 
THE PARTIES ARE SAYING BORIS 
JOHNSON WILL BE MAD 
BUT THIS IS 
NOT JUST POLITICIANS AND THE MEDIA 
WAITING LONDONERS ARE TOO WITH WITH THE HIGHEST TURNOUT IN YEARS I AM 
ON THE SOUTH BANK TO SEE WHAT 
LONDON HAS WON FROM THEIR MAYOR 
ALSO TONIGHT 
I AM NOW LOBOTOMISED I HAVE BECOME 
THE PERFECT CANDIDATE 
IN ONE OF 
THE MOST CLOSELY FOUGHT POLITICAL 
CONTESTS IN YEARS WE BRING YOU THE 
BEHIND THE SCENES FOOTAGE YOU WILL 
NOT WANT TO MISS 
GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO CITY 
HALL A PLACE OF ANTICIPATION AND 
ACTIVITY AS YOU CAN SEE THE VOTES 
ARE STILL BEING COUNTED AND CHECKED 
BUT TONIGHT INSIDERS FROM ALL THE 
MAIN PARTIES SUSPECT THAT LONDON 
MAY SOON HAVE A NEW MAN PRIVATELY 
THEY ARE SAYING BORIS JOHNSON IS 
LIKELY TO HAVE RIDDEN THE BLUE WAVE 
THAT HAS SWEPT ACROSS ENGLAND'S 
COUNCILS AND THE DEFEATED LABOUR'S 
KEN LIVINGSTONE LET'S GO TO THE 
CHAMBER WHERE THE MAYOR WILL BE 
ANNOUNCED AND TO TIM DONOVAN HOW 
DO WE KNOW THIS 
I THINK IN THREE 
HOURS WE WILL HEAR OFFICIALLY BUT 
EVERYONE THINKS THEY KNOW THE 
PARTIES THINK THEY KNOW KEN 
LIVINGSTONE THINKS THAT HE KNOWS 
THAT HIS ERA AT CITY HALL IS COMING 
TO AN END THE REASON IS A STRONG 
INDICATION THAT HAS COME FROM THE 
VOTES ALREADY WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
SEE THE PROGRESS OF THE VOTES 
ABOUT TWO THIRDS HAVE BEEN COUNTED 
SO FAR IN FOUR KEY CONSTITUENCIES 
WHERE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR KEN LIVINGSTONE GOT 
THE MOST FIRST PREFERENCE VOTES HE 
IS BEHIND IN A COUPLE OF THEM HE 
HAS SOME WAY BEHIND WHICH WILL BE 
CRUCIAL BECAUSE AT THE SAME TIME 
IN THOSE HEARTLANDS WHERE HIS BOAT 
HAS BEEN STRONG HE STILL HAS NOT 
BEEN ABLE TO LOSE BORIS JOHNSON 
SHAKE HIM OFF BORIS JOHNSON HAS 
CLEARLY GALVANISED HIS SUPPORTERS 
ACROSS LONDON WHICH IS WHY 
VIRTUALLY EVERYONE THINKS HE WILL 
BE MAYOR 
OF COURSE THE ELECTION IS NOT JUST 
ABOUT POLITICIANS BUT ALSO THE NINE 
MILLION LONDONERS WHOSE LIVES THE 
NEW MAYOR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WILL 
BE GOVERNING WHAT DO THEY THINK 
ABOUT IT MIKE RAMSDEN IS ON THE 
SOUTH BANK WHAT IS THE MOOD DOWN 
THERE 
EVERYBODY IS ENJOYING A NICE THERE FRIDAY NIGHT WITHOUT ANY RAIN WE 
ARE OUTSIDE THE NATIONAL FILM 
THEATRE AND WE HAVE FOUND OURSELVES 
A TACTICAL VOTER HOW DID YOU VOTE 
I ENDED UP VOTING FOR KEN 
LIVINGSTONE 
YOU WERE NOT GOING TO LIVINGSTONE VOTE AT ALL UNTIL LAST WEEK THAT THAT IS RIGHT L. WAS PUT OF THE 
CANDIDATES NONE OF THEM ENGAGED 
WITH ME BUT AS IT GOT CLOSER TO 
THE ELECTION I STARTED THINKING 
ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF 
BORIS GOT IN AND I GOT A BIT 
NERVOUS HE IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY 
INTELLIGENT FELLOW BUT I GOT 
NERVOUS AND FIGURED I WOULD RATHER 
HAVE KEN IN THERE 
THERE IS 
SPECULATION THAT BORIS MIGHT HAVE 
DONE IT ONE MAN WHO WILL BE 
PLEASED IZNIK WHY DID YOU VOTE FOR 
BORIS 
I AM LOOKING FOR MORE BORIS FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY IN THE 
GOVERNMENT I ALSO THINK THAT BORIS 
WILL DO MORE ON STREET CRIME AND 
THAT SORT OF THING 
OF COURSE 
BORIS JOHNSON WORKING VERY HARD IN 
THE SUBURBS CAMPAIGNING OUT THERE 
THIS WAS THE VIEW ABOUT THE 
SPECULATION THAT BORIS JOHNSON 
COULD BECOME MAYOR OUT IN CROUCH 
END AND BEXLEY THIS AFTERNOON IT IT IS A CHANGE ISN'T IT MAYBE KEN 
HAD TOO LONG IN THE JOB 
I AM UPSET 
BECAUSE I WANTED KEN TO WIN 
EVERYONE ROUND HERE ONCE BORIS LE LE SAUX OF TWO EVILS 
THEY ALL DO THE 
SAME THING 
LET'S SPEAK TO HELEN 
TSOI WILES FROM A WEBSITE LONDONIST 
COM HOW DO YOU THINK LONDON WOULD 
CHANGE UNDER BORIS 
IT WOULD BE A 
LESS TOLERANT PLACE FOR SOMEONE 
WHO CAN USE WORDS LIKE HE USES SO 
FREELY IT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE 
OR FAIR IN FACT IT IS SLIGHTLY 
CRUEL 
THANK YOU EVERYBODY IS CRUEL WAITING FOR A DECISION AS SOON AS 
THEY CAN 
EVERYONE WAITING FOR A DECISION 
WITH ME IS THE MINISTER FOR LONDON 
TESSA JOWELL YOU ARE ALSO 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OLYMPICS THE 
E. U. ACCEPT THAT YOU HAVE LOST THE 
MAYORAL ELECTION 
NOT YET L. THINK 
WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL EVERY BOAT 
HAS BEEN COUNTERED BECAUSE MILLIONS 
OF LONDONERS HAVE TAKEN PART IN 
THIS PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE 
THEIR VOTES PROPERLY CONSIDERED 
ARE YOU JUST AN OPTIMIST 
ALWAYS L. 
AM ALWAYS AN OPTIMIST INCIDENTALLY 
I THINK WE ARE IN FOR A LONG NIGHT 
AS KEN LIVINGSTONE'S CAMPAIGN 
MANAGER DO YOU ACCEPT ANY 
RESPONSIBILITY IF HE LOSES 
I THINK 
THERE WILL BE A LONG TIME TO PICK 
OVER THE ENTRAILS OF WHAT HAPPENED 
IN THE EVENT THAT KEN LOSES OR IF 
HE WINS THERE WILL BE LESSONS TO 
BE LEARNT WE HAVE SEEN WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED TO LABOUR THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY AND WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY 
CLEAR IS THAT WHEN YOU GET THAT 
HUGE OUTPOURING OF PUBLIC WILL TO 
SEND A MESSAGE TO THE GOVERNMENT 
ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY IT 
IS VERY HARD TO INSULATE THEIR 
CAMPAIGN IN LONDON FROM THAT THE THE MESSAGE WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM 
LABOUR MINISTERS ON THAT IS THAT IS 
THE POOR ECONOMY THAT IS THE REASON 
FOR THE RESULTS BUT IN LONDON YOU 
CANNOT REALLY BLAME THE POOR 
ECONOMY 
I DO NOT THINK IT IS THE ECONOMY ONLY REASON BUT I THINK THIS WAS A 
CONTEST BETWEEN TWO VERY COLOURFUL 
WELL KNOWN FIGURES BUT ALL THAT I 
AM SAYING IS THAT THE CONTEXT HAS 
BEEN SET BY THE WIDER ANXIETY ABOUT 
THE ECONOMY IT IS BANK HOLIDAY 
MONDAY FAMILIES ARE WORRYING ABOUT 
WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD TO TAKE THE 
KIDS OUT 
LET'S TURN TO THE 
OLYMPICS WHAT WOULD A CONSERVATIVE 
MEAN FOR THE OLYMPICS THE 
MAYOR MEAN FOR THE OLYMPICS THE MAYOR OF LONDON JOINTLY CHAIRS THE 
OLYMPIC BOARD THE MAJOR FORUM FOR 
MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THE OLYMPICS 
WITH ME WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS 
STABILITY AND COMMITMENT MAKING 
SURE THAT THE OLYMPICS ARE 
DELIVERED ON TIME ON BUDGET AND IN 
A WAY THAT INSPIRES THE ENTHUSIASM 
OF PEOPLE ACROSS LONDON AND THE 
COUNTRY 
WE MUST LEAVE IT THERE COUNTRY OPTIMISTIC AS ALWAYS MANY THANKS 
AS WE HAVE SAID RECOUNTING IS 
STILL GOING ON WE ARE WAITING FOR 
RESULTS MANY PEOPLE AT CITY ALL A 
LOT OF MEDIA BEHIND US THE 
COUNTING IS GOING ON IN THREE 
PLACES ACROSS THE CAPITAL CITY 
HALL WE CAN CROSS TO THE COUNT IN 
ALEXANDRA PALACE AND TO KURT 
BARLING BARLING YOU JOIN ME WHERE THEY COUNT IS 
NERVOUSLY ANTICIPATED HAS BEEN 
SINCE ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK P. M. WE ARE UP TO 
ABOUT SEVENTY PER CENT OF VOTES COUNTED L. HAVE 
TO SAY THAT THEY HAVE THESE BAR 
CHARTS AND THEY HAVE BEEN GOING 
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ALL 
AFTERNOON SOMETIMES KEN LOOKS 
AHEAD SOMETIMES BORIS SOMETIMES 
THE CONSERVATIVES LOOK AHEAD 
SOMETIMES LABOUR ONE PERSON BEHIND 
ME SAID IT IS NOT OVER YET THE 
FAT LADY IS TUNING UP BUT NOT READY 
TO SING 
IT HAS OF COURSE BEEN AN 
INCREDIBLY CLOSELY FOUGHT BATTLE 
BETWEEN KEN LIVINGSTONE AND BORIS 
JOHNSON WHILE MUCH OF IT HAS BEEN 
IN THE PUBLIC EYE THERE HAS BEEN A 
LOT GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES 
IMAGINE BEING A FLY ON THE WALL 
GARETH FURBY HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST 
FOUR WEEKS ARMED WITH A SMALL 
CAMERA HERE IS HIS STORY ON BORIS 
JOHNSON'S CAMPAIGN 
APRIL FOOL'S DAY AT THE START OF 
THE CAMPAIGN AND BORIS JOHNSON IS 
ABOUT TO BE AMBUSHED 
HE WOULD BE A 
DISASTER FOR LONDON WE NEED 
SOMEONE SERIOUS INSTEAD OF THIS 
CLOWN 
IT WAS NEVER CLEAR WHO WAS CLOWN BEHIND HIS OPENING SHOT BUT THE 
ISSUE PROVED TO BE CENTRAL TO THIS 
ELECTION NAMELY COULD LONDONERS 
TRUST A CANDIDATE WHOSE FAME WAS 
BASED ON BEING A BATHROOM WELCOME WELCOME TO HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU 
AND A 
TENDENCY TO SPEAK HIS MIND 
UP I 
HAVE FOUR CHILDREN 
AT THE START OF THE CAMPAIGN THERE 
WERE SOME MISFIRES THE CANDIDATE'S 
SHIRT STILL ON TOP HIS HANDS IN 
HIS POCKETS BUT SOON THE STRATEGY 
WAS CLEAR GET OUT AND ABOUT AS 
MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND ABOVE ALL 
GET SERIOUS 
MY GREAT GRANDFATHER 
KNEW THE KORAN OFF BY HEART 
EVERYWHERE BORIS JOHNSON WAS 
ACCOMPANIED BY A TEAM OF PRESS 
OFFICERS AND POTENTIALLY 
EMBARRASSING SITUATIONS WERE 
AVOIDED 
WE ARE NOT PLAYING THERE AVOIDED IS A RISK OF HUMILIATION 
BUT ON A 
WALKABOUT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AND 
IN ROMFORD IT DID 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WERE 
YOU HERE IN ROMFORD LOOK THIS IS 
BORIS JOHNSON'S LOVE CHILD FROM 
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WE HAVE FOUND HIM BORIS BORIS ADMITTED HE WAS MAKING SACRIFICES 
I HAVE ABANDONED ALCOHOL UNTIL MAY 
FIRST WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLE STRAIN 
SOME REPORTS SUGGESTED HE WAS BEING 
CONTROLLED BY HIS CAMPAIGN GURU AN 
AUSTRALIAN CALLED LYNTON CROSBY 
BORIS REFERRED TO HIM WHEN TALKING 
ABOUT HIS FAVOURITE CAMPAIGN FOOD 
TO 
I HAVE A FATAL WEAKNESS FOR TO SAMOSAS IT IS MY LAST REMAINING 
BAD HABIT ALL OF THE OTHERS HAVE 
BEEN RUTHLESSLY EXTERMINATED BY 
LYNTON CROSBY L. AM NOW LOBOTOMISED 
I HAVE BECOME THE PERFECT CANDIDATE 
WHAT WAS GRADUALLY COMING INTO VIEW 
WAS A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE STREAK 
WATCH HIS EXPRESSION AS HIS RIVAL 
CHATS AWAY BEFORE HUSTINGS AND 
NOW WATCH HIS EYES HE WAS PEAKING 
AT KEN LIVINGSTONE'S NOTES 
AS I 
LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER I NOTICED 
THAT HE HAD THE MOST FANTASTICALLY 
ELABORATE SPEECH NOTES WHICH 
CONSISTED OF DIABOLICAL ATTACKS ON 
ME I WAS BONING UP ON HIS LIKELY 
LINE OF ATTACK 
SOMETIMES HE WAS 
BOOED AND OTHER TIMES HE WAS 
RAINED ON 
ALL WEATHERS 
AT ONE 
HUSTINGS HINT OF FRUSTRATION 
AND AT ANOTHER HE WAS ON HIS OWN 
BUT THE PACE OF THIS CAMPAIGN NEVER 
SLACKENED 
I AM LIKE A GREASED SLACKENED PANTHER FINAL ROUND SOON 
ON THE 
LAST DAY OF CAMPAIGNING THERE WAS 
A NEW HAIRCUT 
IT IS A MODEST 
ALTERATION 
AND SOON IT WAS ALL ALTERATION OVER 
MY LAST LEAFLET L. AM VERY OVER NERVOUS NERVOUS ABOUT THE POLL 
TOMORROW THERE IS A FAINT SENSE OF 
RELIEF THERE IS NOT A LOT MORE 
THAT WE CAN DO 
STILL AWAITING 
CONTINUES TO FIND OUT IF THIS 
CAREFULLY CONTROLLED AND RELENTLESS 
CAMPAIGN HAS PAID OFF 
JOINING ME AS AN MCELVOY EXECUTIVE 
EDITOR OF THE EVENING STANDARD AND 
SIMON HOGGART SKETCH WRITER FOR 
THE GUARDIAN 
ARE PEOPLE AT THE STANDARD FEELING 
JUBILANT TONIGHT YOU RAN A PRO 
BORIS CAMPAIGN THE 
WAS 
BORIS CAMPAIGN REALLY INTENDED TO PUT THE MAN'S 
RECORD UNDER SCRUTINY WE HAVE HAD 
A MAYOR OF LONDON FOR EIGHT YEARS 
AND WE WANTED TO APPLY THE SAME 
LEVELS OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND 
SCRUTINY THAT WOULD BE APPLIED 
NATIONALLY THERE IS A LOT OF 
TAXPAYERS' MONEY AND VOTES THAT 
WENT INTO MAKING KEN LIVINGSTONE 
THE MAYOR AND IT WAS TIME TO LOOK 
AT HIS RECORD IN FULL 
IS THIS A 
FIRST A MAN THAT KEN LIVINGSTONE 
DISMISSED AS A JOKE COULD BECOME 
ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL 
POLITICIANS IN THE COUNTRY 
THAT IS 
QUITE A VINDICATION THAT WAS THE 
STORY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
CAMPAIGN WAS BORIS SERIOUS 
ENOUGH THEN THERE WAS A CRITICISM 
THAT HE HAD BECOME BORING BECAUSE 
HE WAS VERY SERIOUS HE DID ALLOW 
SOME OF HIS HUMOUR TO COME THROUGH 
BUT HE DID CALIBRATE IT RIGHT 
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS ON 
COURSE FOR A CONVINCING VICTORY 
SIMON WAS THERE IS EVER ABOUT 
POLICY OR WAS IT ALWAYS ABOUT 
PERSONALITIES 
THE VOTERS WANTED TO PERSONALITIES GIVE LABOUR A KICKING AND IT IS 
INTERESTING THAT BORIS'S BIG 
SUPPORT HAS PILED UP IN THE SUBURBS 
WHERE THEY ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT WHETHER IT WILL 
MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO LONDONERS 
IS ANOTHER MATTER WE HAVE A VERY 
COLOURFUL MAYOR THE THING ABOUT 
BORIS IS THAT HE DOES SAY SOME 
PRETTY WHACKY THINGS BUT THE 
TROUBLE IS THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY 
WE WANT POLITICIANS TO SAY WHAT 
THEY MEAN AND THEY ARE FED UP WITH 
ME MOUTH PEOPLE AS SOON AS THEY 
GET SOMEONE LIKE BORIS WHO'S IS 
EXACTLY WHAT POPS INTO HIS HEAD AT 
ANY GIVEN MOMENT WE COMPLAIN ABOUT 
THAT WHO SAYS WHAT POPS INTO HIS 
HEAD 
FABULOUS MATERIAL FOR SKETCH HEAD WRITERS LIKE YOU WHAT DOES THIS 
MEAN FOR THE CAMERON CAMBER 
IT IS 
INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE 
CAMERON CAMP IT IS THE RETURN OF 
CONSERVATISM AS A SIGNIFICANT FORCE 
IN LONDON THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE 
BEEN UNFASHIONABLE FOR MORE THAN A 
DECADE NOW LONDON 
SET THE 
TREND AND IT MEANS THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT A TARNISHED 
BRAND IN THE METROPOLIS DAVID 
CAMERON WILL BE HEARTENED BY THAT 
IF HE CAN SPREAD IT NATIONALLY IN 
TWO YEARS 
THANK YOU 
WE WILL HAVE A LOOK BEHIND THE 
SCENES OF KEN LIVINGSTONE'S 
CAMPAIGN IN A MOMENT FIRST THE 
LATEST ON THE RESULTS FROM TIM 
DONOVAN IN THE CHAMBER 
ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THINGS 
HAS BEEN THE RATE OF TURNOUT IN 
THIS ELECTION FORTY FIVE PER CENT HAVE COME OUT 
COMPARED WITH THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT LAST TIME IT 
MEANS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LONDONERS HAVE 
DECIDED TO VOTE AND KEN 
LIVINGSTONE LOOKS AS IF HE HAS GOT 
HIS BOAT OUT AND IT LOOKS AS IF HE 
WILL GET MORE VOTES POTENTIALLY 
THEN HE SCORED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR BUT IT IS 
WHERE THE INCREASE IN THE TURNOUT 
APPEARS AS SIMON HOGGART SAID IT 
IS THE SUBURBS THAT ARE RISING UP 
THE BIG INCREASES IN TURNOUT HAVE 
BEEN IN BEXLEY BROMLEY MERTON AND 
WANDSWORTH THAT IS WHERE YOU SEE 
THE BIG DIFFERENTIAL EMERGING 
CONSERVATIVES WHO PERHAPS VOTED 
FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IN THOSE 
REGIONS BEFORE BUT EVEN STUCK WITH 
KEN LIVINGSTONE IN THE SUBURBS 
HAVE REALIGNED TO WHAT HAS BEEN 
HAPPENING NATIONALLY AND GONE FOR 
THE CONSERVATIVES 
OUR REPORTER FOLLOWED KEN 
LIVINGSTONE DURING HIS CAMPAIGN 
LET'S SEE WHAT WENT ON BEHIND THE 
SCENES SCENES AS LONG AS YOU DON'T INVOLVE 
CHILDREN ANIMALS AND VEGETABLES 
THEY LEAD YOU TO LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE 
DEFENDING HIS PRIVATE LIFE NOT THE 
IDEAL START TO CAMPAIGNING 
IS THIS 
THE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL THE TRAM 
IT IS ALWAYS PUBLIC TRANSPORT HE HE WAS OUT TRYING TO ENGAGE VOTERS AND 
CONVINCE HE IS STILL UP FOR IT IF IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW ME FOR THE 
NEXT THREE WEEKS TO SEE IF YOU CAN 
KEEP UP 
I HOPE I CAN RELY ON YOUR VOTE 
AND WHILE HE RELAXED AT THE FIRST 
MAJOR HUSTINGS HIS BIG RIVAL 
DIDN'T SHOW UP 
I BROUGHT A BORIS 
SUBSTITUTE I DON'T BELIEVE IN 
GLOBAL WARMING 
CRIME WAS A HUGE 
ISSUE MORE FOR KIDS TO DO HIS 
ANSWER PROMISING TO SINK IN SEVENTY NINE 
MILLION MILLION IT FELT LIKE A ROCK STAR HAD COME 
TO SOHO AS KEN COURTED ANOTHER 
MINORITY FOUR CLUBS IN ONE EVENING 
A LOT OF EFFORT TO CORNER THE PINK 
VOTE 
I ASK THEM DIFFERENCES ON VOTE LESBIAN AND GAY ISSUES 
DO YOU 
THINK BORIS IS HOMOPHOBIC 
I WOULD 
NEVER MAKE THAT CRITICISM OF ANYONE 
IT WAS THE POLLS NOW SWINGING HIS 
WAY THAT SEEMED TO REJUVENATE KEN 
I AM HAPPY BORIS LOOKS RUN DOWN 
EVEN SO WASN'T LIFE BEYOND THE JOB 
ALREADY ON HIS MIND 
IF I LOST 
THERE WOULD BE A VACANCY ON THE 
AFTER DINER SPEECH CIRCUIT WHERE 
BORIS WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO 
FULFIL WE WOULD BE SWAPPING JOBS 
SUDDENENLY THE OLYMPICS IS THE HOT 
POTATO AFTER MORE PROMISES OVER 
THE COST 
TO SEVEN MILLION YOU YOU MADE IT SOUND LIKE A COMMENTARY IT IT WAS THIS HAS WORKED AS I PLANNED 
ONE WEEK TO GO WAS THE STRAIN 
FINALLY SHOWING TIME FOR STARK 
REMINDER OF WHAT HE HAS LED US 
THROUGH FROM OLYMPIC ELATION IT IT IS AN INDISCRIMINATE ATTEMPT OF 
MASS MURDER TO TERRORIST 
DEVASTATION DEVASTATION MORE WORRIES FOR THE TEAM AS THE 
SLIPPED AWAY AGAIN TIME FOR 
A BOOSTER 
IT IS TOTALLY ENERGISING 
YOU HAVE 
NEVER DONE ANYTHING FOR LONDON 
PEOPLE PEOPLE I WOULD LOVE LITTLE BROWN SAUCE 
ON THAT THANK YOU 
IT IS IN THE 
BAG KEN IT'S IN THE BAG YOU YOU NEVER SAY THAT 
THEY WILL ALL COUNT 
AFTER EIGHT LONG YEARS ALL HE CAN 
DO NOW IS COUNT 
WHEN I PUT MY HEAD 
ON THE PILLOW I WILL GO STRAIGHT TO 
SLEEP 
HAVE YOU ENJOYED IT HAVE SLEEP I HAVE LOVED IT 
DOES LONDON STILL LOVE 
HIM HIM SO WHILE LONDON AND EVERYONE HERE 
STILL WAITS DOZENS OF COUNCIL 
ELECTIONS AROUND THE CAPITAL HAVE 
HAD A RESULT REFLECTING THE 
PICTURE NATIONALLY IT WAS A GOOD 
RESULT FOR THE CONSERVATIVES WHO 
TOOK SEVERAL SEATS INCLUDING THE 
LAST REMAINING LABOUR STRONGHOLD IN 
THE SOUTH EAST 
IN THE SIXTY YEARS THAT HARLOW HAS 
BEEN IN EXISTENCE FIFTY FIVE OF THEM HAVE 
BEEN SPENT AS A STAUNCH LABOUR 
STRONGHOLD LAST NIGHT MORE THAN 
HALF THE COUNCIL FELL TO THE 
CONSERVATIVES A GREAT TIDE OF BLUE 
SWEPT THROUGH A TOWN WHICH JUST TEN 
YEARS AGO HAD ONLY ONE TORY 
COUNCILLOR AND THAT MAN IS NOW THE 
CONSERVATIVE LEADER IN HARLOW AS 
SURPRISED AS ANYONE AT LAST NIGHT'S 
VICTORY 
WE ALWAYS KNEW WE COULD VICTORY TAKE THE TOWN JUST THERE WAS ONE 
REPICKED UP LAST NIGHT WHICH WAS A 
SURPRISE TO WIN IT BY SUCH A LARGE 
MAJORITY WAS SURPRISING HARLOW HARLOW NEEDED SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO GET 
IT BACK ON TRACK LABOUR HAS BEEN

THEY ENJOY A WIN IN 
ELM BRIDGE FROM NO OVERALL CONTROL 
ANOTHER CHANGE HAPPENED IN SAINT 
ALBANS HERE THE LIB DEMS TAKE 
CHARGE OF A TOWN UNDER PREVIOUSLY 
NO OVER ALL CONTROL 
IT IS A GOOD 
RESULT IT PROVIDES US WITH A 
PLATFORM TO PROVIDE US OVER THE 
NEXT MONTHS AND YEARS THE LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT IS IN A GREAT DEAL OF 
TROUBLE PEOPLE I DON'T THINK KNOW 
WHAT DAVID CAMERON STANDS FOR 
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL TO PLAY FOR 
NO OVERALL CONTROL IN READING ONE 
OF LABOUR'S BITTEREST BLOWS THEY 
LOST THE TOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
TWENTY YEARS
