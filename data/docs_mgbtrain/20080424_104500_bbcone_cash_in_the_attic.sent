MAUREEN'S HOUSE IS FULL OF ANTIQUES SHE'S INHERITED 
HOPEFULLY WE'LL FIND LOTS OF COLLECTABLES TO TAKE TO AUCTION 
SO MAUREEN AND HER FAMILY CAN HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME CELEBRATING HER BIRTHDAY 
OUR PAUL IS ALREADY HARD AT WORK SEEING WHAT HER HOME HAS TO OFFER 
AH PAUL AH HELLO MEET THE LADIES 
HOW ARE YOU THIS IS MAUREEN AND SUSAN AND MARGARET 
HI HI SO WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND THERE THEN PAUL 
A COUPLE OF THINGS BUT THE MAIN THING I'VE FOUND WHICH HAS REALLY TAKEN MY EYE IS THIS ONE HERE 
IT'S A CRACKER OH THAT'S MY UNCLE'S DOG WHOSE DOG 
WELL THAT WAS MY UNCLE AS HE USED TO BE A GAMEKEEPER FOR THE QUEEN OH DARLING 
HELLO YAH I DIDN'T REALISE WE WERE IN SUCH GRAND COMPANY 
WELL FUNNILY ENOUGH I MEAN HUNTING DOGS THEY DO HAVE A ROYAL CONNECTION 
THEY'RE ALWAYS A SIGN OF AFFLUENCE AREN'T THEY I MEAN IF YOU'VE GOT THE TEAM OF DOGS 
YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE OUTFITS THAT THEY WEAR THESE REALLY REPRESENT THAT AND THE IDEA IS THAT 
AFTER THE HUNT THE DOGS WOULD SIT IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AND THESE WOULD SIT ON THE MANTELPIECE 
REPRESENTING THAT OH RIGHT THEY WOULD SIT AROUND THE FIREPLACE BUT THIS IS MADE FROM BASALT 
HAVE YOU HEARD OF BASALT NO NOT BATH SALTS MY ACCENT THERE 
YOU CAN PUT IT IN THE BATH 
NO BASALT IS LIKE A ROCK OR ALMOST LIKE A STONE OH RIGHT 
THEY MADE A CERAMIC VERSION OF IT BUT A LONG TIME AGO NOW 
YOU'RE LOOKING SORT OF ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THAT SORT OF TIME 
I THINK THAT'S WHEN THIS WAS MADE THE UNFORTUNATE THING WITH ALL POTTERY ITEMS 
IS THAT IT'S DAMAGED CAN YOU SEE YES AROUND HIS TAIL 
YES HIS TAIL WAS SO WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF VALUE 
VALUE WISE THIRTY TO FIFTY DOES THAT SOUND ALL RIGHT YES 
SO THE DOG'S OFF FOR AUCTION LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO MAKE YOU BARK O. K. COME ON 
MAN'S BEST FRIEND HAS PULLED US THROUGH LET'S HOPE THAT BIT OF DAMAGE 
DOESN'T HOLD BACK THE BIDDERS ON AUCTION DAY 
WE'RE ALL MAKING SURE WE DON'T LEAVE OUT ANY COLLECTABLES AT MAUREEN'S PLACE THAT COULD MAKE A GOOD SALE 
SOME ARE HIDDEN AWAY WHILE OTHERS ARE STANDING PROUD 
HI MARGARET HELLO HAVE YOU FOUND ANYTHING MUCH 
YES THIS DESK OH RIGHT THAT'S QUITE A NICE ONE ISN'T IT IT IS 
WHO'S IS THIS THEN DO YOU KNOW IT WAS MAUREEN'S HUSBAND'S 
JOHN HIS FAMILY'S AND IT'S BEEN PASSED DOWN 
AND DO YOU EVER REMEMBER HIM USING IT YES I DO 
HE HAD HIS COMPUTER ON IT WELL THIS IS CALLED A PEDESTAL DESK 
AND THE IDEA IS IT'S MADE IN THREE SEPARATE PIECES SO YOU'VE GOT THESE TWO COLUMNS OR PEDESTALS 
ON THE SIDE AND THEN THIS TOP FRIEZE ON THE TOP HERE 
SO YOU COULD TAKE THE TOP OFF AND THEN MOVE IT QUITE EASILY 
WHEREAS IF IT WAS ONE COMPLETE KNEEHOLE DESK THE OLD FASHIONED TYPE 
IT'S A BIT AWKWARD TO MOVE AROUND AND YOU CAN'T 
YES WELL THESE ARE QUITE COLLECTABLE NOW WE'RE IN THE COMPUTER AGE 
SO LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE THESE THIS ONE'S QUITE SIMPLE 
IT'S ALMOST ARTS AND CRAFTS IT'S QUITE A SIMPLE PIECE 
BUT IT DOES NEED A BIT OF RESTORATION 
IN HERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LEATHER TOP 
BEAUTIFULLY TOOLED AROUND THE EDGE ALL THIS LOVELY GILDING 
AND SO ON SO WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE THEN IS AN EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY 
OAK PEDESTAL DESK AND I THINK AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED 
MAYBE UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NICE 
SO DO YOU THINK MAUREEN WOULD RATHER HAVE 
AN OLD DESK OR A BIT OF A KNEES UP 
I THINK SHE MIGHT LIKE THE KNEES UP O. K. WELL THAT'S 
THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL FOR THIS ONE YES O. K. LET'S KEEP LOOKING 
THE BIRTHDAY BASH FUND IS FILLING UP STEADILY 
AND WE'VE PLENTY MORE ROOMS TO SEARCH IN MAUREEN KNOWS WHERE TO LOOK 
TUCKED AWAY IN A DRAWER DOWNSTAIRS 
SHE PULLS OUT THESE SOLID SILVER CUTLERY SETS 
COMPLETE WITH THEIR PRESENTATION CASES 
THEY COULD FETCH BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE AND FORTY FIVE 
STAYING DOWNSTAIRS PAUL WANTS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT ANOTHER EYE CATCHING PIECE OF FURNITURE 
SUSAN NOW THEN HIYA YOU ALL RIGHT FINE THANK YOU 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THIS HAS COME FROM FROM UNCLE VICTOR'S AS WELL 
THIS IS ANOTHER PIECE THAT WAS IN HIS HOUSE MUM INHERITED IT 
WHEN HE DIED THAT WAS LEFT TO HER WITH ALL ITS CONTENTS 
WE USED TO GO DOWN WHEN IT WAS ASCOT WEEK AND SEE THE QUEEN GO PAST AND EVERYTHING 
DO YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS A GLAMOROUS LIFESTYLE DOESN'T IT 
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TALKING POINT OF THE HOUSE 
THE IDEA IS THAT WITH THESE LOVELY CABINETS IS THAT IN HERE WOULD BE ALL YOUR ARTEFACTS 
THAT YOU BRING BACK FROM ABROAD OR FROM PLACES OF INTEREST BUT THE RESULT NOW 
WHEN WE COME TO LOOK AT THESE IS THAT WE HAVE THESE LOVELY SMALL CABINETS 
YOU COULD PUT D. V. D. S. IN THERE YOU COULD RE USE THEM COULDN'T YOU 
AND IT HAS A VERY CLASSIC STYLE AND THEN ON THIS EXAMPLE SOMEBODY'S ACTUALLY PAINTED THIS 
AND THE WHOLE THING IS VERY ELEGANT VERY TASTEFUL REALLY 
IT'S A GOOD QUALITY ITEM IT'S MAHOGANY IT'S ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
IT'S A GOOD STYLE AND I THINK VALUE WISE ERM 
ONE HUNDRED POSSIBLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY VERY GOOD YES SO WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR MUM WILL DO 
WITH ALL THE BITS AND PIECES IN THERE DON'T KNOW FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO PUT THEM OR SELL THEM 
IN OTHER WORDS WE'LL LET HER WORRY ABOUT IT ABSOLUTELY O. K. LET'S KEEP LOOKING LOVELY THANK YOU 
STAYING DOWNSTAIRS PAUL WANTS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT ANOTHER EYE CATCHING PIECE OF FURNITURE

IN THE FORM OF THESE THREE MAHOGANY VICTORIAN 
BALLOON BACKED DINING CHAIRS IN GOOD CONDITION 
AND WELL UPHOLSTERED TOGETHER THEY COULD FETCH AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
WITH PAUL AND MARGARET HUNTING OUT MORE COLLECTABLES 
I JOIN MAUREEN AND SUSAN FOR A CUPPA 
IT SEEMS MAUREEN'S LATE HUSBAND HAS BEEN THE INSPIRATION FOR HER BIRTHDAY PLANS 
NOW I WANT TO START WITH YOUR DAD'S SEVENTIETH BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT SET THE BALL ROLLING 
SO TELL ME WHAT YOU DID FOR HIS WELL WE ALL WENT TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT HE TREATED US ALL 
TO A WEEK IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT SANDOWN 
WE USED TO GO THERE AS CHILDREN ON HOLIDAY AND HE TOOK US ALL BACK ALL MY SISTERS AND ALL THE CHILDREN 
AND EVERYBODY AND WE HAD A NICE WEEK DIDN'T WE IN THE SUNSHINE M. M. M. ON HIS BIRTHDAY HE DRESSED UP 
IN A TWENTY S. SWIMMING COSTUME YOU KNOW GREEN AND BLACK STRIPES 
OH SO DID YOU KNOW HE WAS GOING TO DO THAT WE DIDN'T NO HE APPEARED ON THE BEACH 
WE'D HAD A CHAMPAGNE BREAKFAST AND ALL ON THE BEACH AND THEN HE APPEARED ON THE BEACH 
WITH HIS BOATER AND HIS FULL LENGTH SWIMMING COSTUME IT WAS AFTER A CHAMPAGNE BREAKFAST 
WHICH MAY EXPLAIN A BIT I SUSPECT 
HE'D HIRED IT FROM A FANCY DRESS SHOP BACK HERE AND TAKEN IT 
AND NOBODY APART FROM MUM KNEW HE WAS GOING TO DO IT SO WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA REALLY 
THAT YOU MAUREEN SHOULD DO SOMETHING ME REALLY I WAS THINKING HE DID SOMETHING 
SO MAYBE IT'S A BIG BIRTHDAY SHE'S GOT TO GET MY OTHER SISTER OVER FROM FRANCE AS WELL 
OH SHE LIVES IN FRANCE ONE OF THEM DOES SO SHE'LL HAVE TO COME OVER HERE FIRST 
SHE'S GOT A HUSBAND THAT'S THE YOUNGEST GRANDSON HE'S FOUR

WELL IF WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT MONEY WE NEED TO SEE WHETHER PAUL 
HAS FOUND ANYTHING ELSE TO SELL COME ON 
MAUREEN'S HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS MIGHT BE A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW BUT WE'LL DO OUR BEST 
FINGERS CROSSED WE'LL MAKE PLENTY OF MONEY AT AUCTION SO SHE CAN GO TO TOWN ON HER SPECIAL DAY 
SUSAN'S NEXT FIND COULD HELP OUR FUNDS 
THIS TAPERED LIMOGES JUG 
PAINTED WITH AN IRIS 
COULD FETCH UP TO FIFTY 
I MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO STOP FOR A CUPPA BUT I DIDN'T GIVE PAUL PERMISSION 
OH HELLO AH HELLO WELL WHAT'S THIS WE'RE NOW HAVING TEA 
ON A MINIATURE SCALE ARE WE YES IT'S VERY PRETTY I LIKE THE COLOUR SCHEME OF THAT M. M. M. 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SET JUST TRYING TO WORK OUT 
HOW MANY PIECES WE'VE GOT IS IT A CHILDREN'S TEA SET 
YES I THINK SO THERE'S A LITTLE THING IN HERE OH 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK IT SAYS STAFFORDSHIRE 
ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY CHARLES TEA SERVICE 
LENT BY A MRS. GAY OF EAST GRINSTEAD 
THAT'S MY GRANDMOTHER AH WAS IT REALLY AH 
THIS IS AN EXACT MODEL OF A FULL SIZED SET THAT YOU COULD BUY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY 
WOULD IT BE IN THE NURSERY WITH THE NANNY YES OF COURSE O. K. 
VERY OFTEN AT AUCTIONS AND ANTIQUE FAIRS YOU DO SEE 
ONE ITEM BEING SOLD SO WOULD YOU SUGGEST SPLITTING THIS UP 
OR JUST SELLING IT AS A LOT I THINK IT'S A PART SERVICE 
BUT IT'S IN PRETTY GOOD CONDITION THE FUNNY THING IS 
YOU COULD GET A LARGE SERVICE A FULL SIZED TEA CUP AND SAUCER 
WHICH WOULD FETCH LESS THAN THE DOLL'S OR THE CHILD'S TEA SERVICES 
SO THEY HAVEN'T SURVIVED IN GREAT NUMBERS WHAT SORT OF VALUE THEN 
AS A NICE PART SET LIKE THIS 
I WOULD SAY AT LEAST SIXTY UPWARDS REALLY 
SO SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED I THINK IS A FAIR ESTIMATE ON THAT AND I'D EXPECT IT TO FETCH A BIT MORE 
ARE YOU PLEASED WITH THAT YES 
THE SEARCH IS STILL GOING STRONG 
AND THROWING UP ALL KINDS OF INTERESTING ITEMS 
PAUL'S NEXT DISCOVERY IS THE ADULT VERSION OF THAT CHILDREN'S TEA SERVICE 
THIS GROWN UP SET DECORATED WITH INTRICATE FLOWERS 
ON A WHITE BACKGROUND COULD FETCH BETWEEN THIRTY AND FIFTY 
ANOTHER GREAT FIND THESE VICTORIAN SOLID SILVER SALT POTS 
WITH THEIR HALLMARKED SILVER SPOONS SHOULD LOOK TERRIFIC 
ON ANY DINING ROOM TABLE AND TOGETHER COULD BRING IN UP TO FORTY 
JUST WHEN WE THOUGHT WE'D COVERED EVERY INCH OF MAUREEN'S HOME 
PAUL CALLS US TOGETHER TO ADMIRE THE LAST FIND OF THE DAY 
MAUREEN LOOK AT THESE THESE REALLY ARE FANTASTIC QUALITY 
LOOK THAT'S A POSH GOBLET ISN'T IT IT IS NICE YES YES 
I LIKE THAT WHERE DID THESE COME FROM MAUREEN 
WELL YOU'LL NEVER GUESS MY UNCLE VICTOR AH SO IT CAME FROM THE QUEEN INDIRECTLY 
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL HE HAD VERY GOOD TASTE DIDN'T HE 
THESE ITEMS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY EXPENSIVE I MEAN JUST THE NATURE OF THEM 
MOST PEOPLE HAD EVERYDAY CHINA AND BITS AND PIECES 
BUT TO HAVE PURELY ORNAMENTAL ITEMS LIKE THIS THAT WAS A VERY POSH HOUSE 
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MADE WITH REAL GOLD 
THEY PUT GOLD LEAF IN THE MIXTURE AND WHEN IT'S FIRED AT A HIGH TEMPERATURE IT TURNS PINK 
AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN HIGHLY PRIZED THESE ARE ACTUALLY AUSTRIAN 
AND THE LOOSE TERM IS BOHEMIAN GLASS THIS ONE UNFORTUNATELY 
HAS BEEN DAMAGED WHERE IT GETS NARROW IN THE MIDDLE 
IT'S SNAPPED OFF AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS BEEN REPAIRED 
BUT A LONG TIME AGO WHAT SORT OF VALUE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT PAUL 
WELL I THINK THOSE ARE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL AND I THINK VALUE WISE 
EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THAT SORT OF PRICE BAND VERY GOOD DOES THAT SOUND ALL RIGHT YES YES 
I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THAT BECAUSE IT TOPS UP OUR TOTAL QUITE NICELY 
WE'VE RUN OUT OF TIME IN TERMS OF THE RUMMAGE BUT YOU WANTED FIVE HUNDRED 
TOWARDS THESE CELEBRATIONS DIDN'T YOU I'VE DONE SOME TOTTING UP 
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE OVERALL TOTAL OF THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING GOING TO AUCTION FOR YOU 
COMES TO SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THAT'S REALLY GOOD YES I WAS SURPRISED 
I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING WAS WORTH ANYTHING ACTUALLY BUT IT'S GOOD 
SO THERE'S A BIT MORE THERE THAN YOU WERE HOPING FOR ISN'T THERE YES IT'S VERY GOOD 
O. K. WELL THE NEXT TIME WE SEE YOU GUYS WILL BE AT THE AUCTION HOUSE 
WHERE EVERYTHING WILL BE ON DISPLAY I'M HOPING THERE'LL BE SOME CUDDLY CASH AT THE END OF IT
