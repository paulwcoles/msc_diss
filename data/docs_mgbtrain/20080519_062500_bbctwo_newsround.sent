HI THERE YOU'RE WATCHING NEWSROUND 
ON MONDAY MORNING OUR TOP STORY 
TODAY TODAY THREE DAYS OF MOURNING HAVE STARTED 
IN CHINA FOR VICTIMS OF THE 
EARTHQUAKE THERE A WEEK AGO 
SURVIVORS OF THE QUAKE HAVE BEEN 
RAISING FLAGS TO REMEMBER THOSE WHO 
DIED AND A THREE MINUTE SILENCE 
WILL BE HELD JUST BEFORE SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY 
THE EXACT MOMENT THE EARTHQUAKE HIT 
ARE YOU GETTING A LIFT TO SCHOOL 
THIS MORNING WELL ONE CHARITY 
RECKONS SPENDING A 
LOT OF 
TIME 
BEING DRIVEN 
AROUND MEANS 
YOU'RE 
MORE LIKELY 
TO BE 
IN AN ACCIDENT 
WHEN YOU'RE ON FOOT A NEW 
CLAIMS KIDS DON'T HAVE 
EXPERIENCE OF CROSSING ROADS THAT MEANS THERE ARE 
LOTS OF 
ACCIDENTS WHEN 
THEY MOVE 
UP TO 
SECONDARY SCHOOL AND START WALKING 
THERE THERE IT LOOKS LIKE FLY HALF DANNY 
CIPRIANI HAS BROKEN HIS ANKLE AND 
WILL MISS 
ENGLAND'S TOUR OF 
ZEALAND AND THE PREMIERSHIP PLAY 
OFF FINAL CIPRIANI CRIED OUT IN 
PAIN AFTER HE WAS 
TACKLED IN 
THE 
WASPS' SEMI FINAL WIN OVER BATH 
YESTERDAY HE HAD TO BE STRETCHERED 
OFF AND NEEDED OXYGEN 
WASPS WILL 
CONFIRM TODAY 
HOW BAD THE 
INJURY IS 
WE 
KNOW ROBOTS 
CAN 
BE PRETTY 
BUT 
ARE THEY 
REALLY 
SMART ENOUGH 
TO 
CONDUCT AN 
ORCHESTRA WELL 
ONE 
WAS ASIMO 
THE 
ROBOT CONDUCTED 
ONE WAS ASIMO THE ROBOT CONDUCTED AN 
ON HIS 
OWN SO 
THAT GOT US 
THINKING 
WHAT 
WOULD YOU 
PROGRAM A 
ROBOT TO DO FOR 
WOULD YOU PROGRAM A ROBOT TO DO FOR YOU YOU LEWIS SAYS SHE WOULD LIKE A ROBOT 
THAT WOULD PLAY THE CELLO BECAUSE 
SHE ALSO PLAYS A CELLO 
BUT FREYA SAYS SHE WOULD MAKE THE 
ROOM WOULD GO TO HER BORING PIANO 
LESSON LESSON HOW IT FROM SOUTHAMPTON SAYS I 
WOULD MAKE MY ROBOT DISGUISE ITSELF 
AS ME AND GO TO SCHOOL WHILE I HAVE 
FUN AT HOME 
AND DANIEL FROM HEART SAYS HE WOULD 
GET IT TO PROTECT HIM FROM 
HERTFORDSHIRE HERTFORDSHIRE ZACK FROM WORTHING SAYS I WOULD 
LET THE ROBOT GO TO SCHOOL FOR ME 
BUT WHEN IT COMES BACK IT WOULD 
PUT ALL THE INFORMATION INSIDE MY 
HEAD HEAD MERCURY IS A METAL THAT IS LIQUID 
AT ROOM TEMPERATURE THE CAPITAL OF 
ICELAND IS RICKY VIC 
AND CANHAM SAYS I WOULD GET MY 
ROBOT TO SCAN AT A SPACE FOR 
INTELLIGENT LIFE AND THEN INVITE 
THEM TO EARTH 
THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS KEEP 
THEM COMING IN WHAT QUIET AND 
FINALLY TO A GOLFER MAKING QUITE A 
SPLASH RICHARD FINCH WON THE IRISH 
OPEN YESTERDAY BUT HIS WALK DOWN 
THE EIGHTEENTH WAS MORE LIKE A WADDLE 
THIS WAS HIS THIRD SHOT TO THE EIGHTEENTH 
IT WAS 
FROM A 
STEEP BANK SO YOU 
CAN'T BLAME 
HIM FOR LOSING HIS 
FOOTING AT LEAST THE BALL MADE IT 
SAFELY TO THE GREEN AND THAT WAS 
ENOUGH FOR 
FINCH TO 
CLAIM HIS 
SECOND VICTORY OF THE YEAR 
I'LL BE BACK WITH YOUR NEXT UPDATE 
IN AN HOUR SEE YOU
