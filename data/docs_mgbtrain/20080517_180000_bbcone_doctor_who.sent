DOCTOR DOCTOR SORRY 
CHARLEMAGNE LIVED CENTURIES AGO 
I'VE GOT A VERY GOOD MEMORY 
FOR SUCH AN EXPERIENCED DETECTIVE YOU MISSED A BIG CLUE

OUR NEMESIS REMAINS AT LARGE 
UNLESS MISS NOBLE'S FOUND SOMETHING 
YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING IN THERE 
HOW COME IT'S LOCKED LADY EDDISON COMMANDS IT TO BE SO 
AND I COMMAND IT TO BE OTHERWISE 
SCOTLAND YARD PIP PIP 
WHY'S IT LOCKED IN THE FIRST PLACE 
MANY YEARS AGO WHEN MY FATHER WAS BUTLER TO THE FAMILY 
LADY EDDISON RETURNED FROM INDIA WITH MALARIA

BECAUSE WE HAVE A MURDERER IN OUR MIDST AND WHEN IT COMES TO DETECTION THERE'S NONE FINER 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I GIVE YOU

A HOUSE OF SECRETS 
TO UNDERSTAND THE SOLUTION WE MUST EXAMINE THEM ALL 
STARTING WITH YOU 
MISS REDMOND 
BUT I'M INNOCENT SURELY 
YOU'VE NEVER MET THESE PEOPLE 
AND THESE PEOPLE HAD NEVER MET YOU 
I THINK THE REAL ROBINA REDMOND NEVER LEFT LONDON YOU'RE IMPERSONATING HER 
HOW SILLY WHAT PROOF DO YOU HAVE 
YOU SAID YOU'D BEEN TO THE TOILET 
OH I KNOW THIS IF SHE WAS REALLY POSH SHE'D SAY LOO 
EARLIER TODAY MISS NOBLE AND I FOUND THIS ON THE LAWN 
RIGHT BENEATH YOUR BATHROOM WINDOW 
YOU HEARD MISS NOBLE WAS SEARCHING THE BEDROOMS AND PANICKED 
YOU RAN UPSTAIRS AND DISPOSED OF THE EVIDENCE 
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT THING BEFORE IN MY LIFE 
WHAT'S INSIDE IT THE TOOLS OF YOUR TRADE MISS REDMOND 
OR SHOULD I SAY 
THE UNICORN 
YOU CAME TO THIS HOUSE WITH ONE SOLE INTENTION 
TO STEAL THE FIRESTONE 
OH ALL RIGHT THEN IT'S A FAIR COP

EVER SO NICE TO MEET YA I DON'T FINK I TOOK MY CHANCE IN THE DARK AND NABBED IT 
WELL GO ON THEN YOU KNOBS 
ARREST ME SLING ME IN JAIL 
SO IS SHE THE MURDERER DON'T BE SO THICK 
I MIGHT BE A THIEF BUT I AIN'T NO KILLER QUITE 
THERE ARE DARKER MOTIVES AT WORK 
AND IN EXAMINING THIS HOUSEHOLD WE COME TO YOU 
COLONEL 
DAMN IT WOMAN 
YOU WITH YOUR PERSPICACITY 
YOU'VE RUMBLED ME 
HUGH YOU CAN WALK BUT WHY 
MY DARLING HOW ELSE COULD I BE CERTAIN OF KEEPING YOU BY MY SIDE 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU'RE STILL A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN CLEMENCY 
SOONER OR LATER SOME CHAP WILL TURN YOUR HEAD 
I COULDN'T BEAR THAT 
STAYING IN THE CHAIR WAS THE ONLY WAY I COULD BE CERTAIN OF KEEPING YOU 
CONFOUND IT MRS. CHRISTIE HOW DID YOU DISCOVER THE TRUTH 
UM ACTUALLY I HAD NO IDEA 
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY YOU'RE COMPLETELY INNOCENT OH 
SORRY 
SHALL I SIT DOWN THEN I THINK YOU BETTER HAD 
SO HE'S NOT THE MURDERER 
INDEED NOT TO FIND THE TRUTH 
LET'S RETURN TO THIS 
FAR MORE THAN THE UNICORN'S OBJECT OF DESIRE 
THE FIRESTONE HAS QUITE A HISTORY 
LADY EDDISON I'VE DONE NOTHING 
YOU BROUGHT IT BACK FROM INDIA DID YOU NOT 
BEFORE YOU MET THE COLONEL 
YOU CAME HOME WITH MALARIA AND CONFINED YOURSELF TO THIS 
HOUSE FOR SIX MONTHS IN A ROOM THAT HAS BEEN KEPT LOCKED EVER SINCE WHICH I RATHER THINK MEANS 
STOP PLEASE I'M SO SORRY 
BUT YOU HAD FALLEN PREGNANT IN INDIA 
UNMARRIED AND ASHAMED YOU HURRIED BACK TO ENGLAND WITH YOUR CONFIDANTE A YOUNG MAID 
LATER TO BECOME HOUSEKEEPER MISS CHANDRAKALA 
CLEMENCY IS THIS TRUE 
MY POOR BABY 
I HAD TO GIVE HIM AWAY 
THE SHAME OF IT BUT YOU'VE NEVER SAID A WORD 
I HAD NO CHOICE IMAGINE THE SCANDAL 
THE FAMILY NAME 
I'M BRITISH I CARRY ON 
AND IT WAS NO ORDINARY PREGNANCY 
HOW CAN YOU KNOW THAT 
SCUSE ME AGATHA THIS IS MY TERRITORY 
BUT WHEN YOU HEARD THAT BUZZING SOUND IN THE DINING ROOM YOU SAID IT CAN'T BE 
WHY DID YOU SAY THAT 
YOU'D NEVER BELIEVE IT 
THE DOCTOR HAS OPENED MY MIND TO BELIEVE MANY THINGS 
IT WAS FORTY YEARS AGO IN THE HEAT OF DELHI LATE ONE NIGHT 
I WAS ALONE AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW IT 
A DAZZLING LIGHT IN THE SKY 
THE NEXT DAY HE CAME TO THE HOUSE 
CHRISTOPHER THE MOST HANDSOME MAN I'D EVER SEEN 
OUR LOVE BLAZED LIKE A WILDFIRE 
I HELD NOTHING BACK 
AND IN RETURN HE SHOWED ME THE INCREDIBLE TRUTH ABOUT HIMSELF 
HE'D MADE HIMSELF HUMAN TO LEARN ABOUT US THIS WAS HIS TRUE SHAPE 
I LOVED HIM SO MUCH IT DIDN'T MATTER 
BUT HE WAS STOLEN FROM ME 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THE YEAR OF THE GREAT MONSOON 
THE RIVER JUMNA ROSE UP AND BROKE ITS BANKS 
HE WAS TAKEN AT THE FLOOD 
BUT CHRISTOPHER LEFT ME A GIFT A JEWEL LIKE NO OTHER 
I WORE IT ALWAYS PART OF ME NEVER FORGOT 
I KEPT IT CLOSE 
ALWAYS 
JUST LIKE A MAN FLASHES HIS FAMILY JEWELS AND YOU END UP WITH A BUN IN THE OVEN 
A POOR LITTLE CHILD 
FORTY YEARS AGO MISS CHANDRAKALA TOOK THAT NEWBORN BABE TO AN ORPHANAGE 
BUT PROFESSOR PEACH WORKED IT OUT 
HE FOUND THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE 
OH THAT'S MAIDEN MAIDEN NAME 
PRECISELY SO SHE KILLED HIM 
I DID NOT MISS CHANDRAKALA FEARED THAT THE PROFESSOR HAD UNEARTHED YOUR SECRET 
SHE WAS COMING TO WARN YOU 
SO SHE KILLED HER I DID NOT LADY EDDISON 
IS INNOCENT 
BECAUSE AT THIS POINT DOCTOR 
THANK YOU AT THIS POINT WHEN WE CONSIDER THE LIES AND THE SECRETS 
AND THE KEY TO THESE EVENTS THEN WE HAVE TO CONSIDER 
IT WAS YOU DONNA NOBLE 
WHAT WHO DID I KILL NO BUT YOU SAID IT ALL ALONG THE VITAL CLUE 
THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS BEING ACTED OUT LIKE A MURDER MYSTERY 
WHICH MEANS 
IT WAS YOU AGATHA CHRISTIE
