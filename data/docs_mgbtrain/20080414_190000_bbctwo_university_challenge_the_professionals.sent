ASKING THE QUESTIONS JEREMY PAXMAN 
HELLO IT'S THE LAST OF THE FIRST ROUND MATCHES TONIGHT 
WITH THE SEMI FINAL PLACES GOING TO THE FOUR HIGHEST SCORING TEAMS 
WE KNOW ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY IS THE SCORE TO BEAT 
TONIGHT'S FIXTURE IS BETWEEN TWO TEAMS WHO MIGHT HAVE DIFFERING VIEWS OF THE WORLD AND WHAT LIES BEYOND 
FIRST A TEAM FROM THE CLERGY AND CONGREGATION OF SALISBURY CATHEDRAL 
A FINE EXAMPLE OF EARLY ENGLISH GOTHIC AND THIS YEAR IT CELEBRATES ITS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE CONSECRATION OF THE COMPLETED BUILDING IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT 
WE MET UP WITH THE TEAM IN TIME FOR EVENSONG

SALISBURY CATHEDRAL IS THE CATHEDRAL FOR THE DIOCESE OF SALISBURY WHICH IS WILTSHIRE AND DORSET 
AND IT WAS FOUNDED IN ONE THOUSAND SEVENTY FIVE TO WORSHIP GOD AND TO HELP OTHERS TO KNOW HIM

CHURCHES ARE GROUPS OF DIVERSE PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS 
I THINK THAT'LL ADD TO OUR RANGE AND STRENGTH IN THE COMPETITION
