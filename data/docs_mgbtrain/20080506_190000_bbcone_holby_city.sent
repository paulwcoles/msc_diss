HOWEVER WHEN I EXPLAINED THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICATION 
I'M INTRIGUED TO FIND OUT WHO'S DEMANDING OUR V. I. P. SERVICE 
I THOUGHT SEEING AS THOUGH I WAS IN THE AREA

MRS. GRAYSON 
SO MY HEART'S SHORT CIRCUITING 
IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING 
AND THIS OTHER THING THAT'S NOT WORKING RIGHT THE VALVE 
THE MITRAL VALVE YES 
IT WORKS A BIT LIKE A TINY LITTLE DAM INSIDE THE HEART 
CONTROLLING THE BLOOD FLOW FROM ONE SIDE OF THE HEART TO THE OTHER 
SORT OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
ANYWAY THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT BOTH CONDITIONS ARE COMPLETELY TREATABLE 
BUT I WAS FINE YESTERDAY

GOOD OLD BLOODSUCKING HOLBY CARE 
IT'S NICE TO MEET A VAMPIRE DURING THE DAY 
WE ALL FEAR WHAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND CONNIE 
I'M CURIOUS WHEN CAN WE EXPECT A FULL DAY'S WORK OUT OF YOU MR. SPENCE 
IT'S NICE TO BE MISSED 
DON'T GET TOO CARRIED AWAY 
COME ON TAKE IT EASY 
M. M. M. 
NOT TOO HOT FOR YOU IS IT 
AND IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IN THE FORTY FIVE MONTHS 
SINCE MR. CULLEN TOOK OVER A. A. U. WE'VE SEEN AVERAGE WAITING TIMES CUT BY TWENTY PER CENT 
INCREASED EFFICIENCY IN STAFF ROTAS AND A STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN PATIENT RATINGS 
ALL THIS ACHIEVED DESPITE THE CONSIDERABLE DISRUPTION 
OF THE BUILDING AND EQUIPPING OF A BRAND NEW OPERATING THEATRE IN A. A. U. 
AN OPERATING THEATRE WHICH HAS TRANSFORMED A. A. U. INTO A FIRST CLASSSURGICAL UNIT 
WHICH WILL THANKS TO YOU AND THE REST OF YOUR COLLEAGUES AT THE WYVERN HEALTH AUTHORITY 
BE A JEWEL IN THE CROWN OF NOT JUST THIS HOSPITAL BUT THE ENTIRE COUNTY 
BUT DON'T JUST TAKE MY WORD FOR IT 
MR. CULLEN PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS PLEASE 
THANK YOU 
ER I THINK IT WOULD BE 
SHE'S A LOVELY LOOKING GIRL ISN'T SHE 
SORRY WHO 
DAISHA OH YES 
LOVELY 
AND SHE'S ABSOLUTELY PERFECT AS THE NEW FACE OF THE BYRNE FOUNDATION MM HMM 
ELLIOT 
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THE BIG QUESTION 
IS HOW WE MAKE THE FOUNDATION WORK BEST FOR THE HOSPITAL 
IT'S THE ONE THING WE HAVE TO GET ABSOLUTELY RIGHT FROM THE START 
IS THERE ANY POINT IN US DISCUSSING ANYTHING TODAY ELLIOT 
I'M SORRY LOOK SORRY THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE MIX UP ABOUT THE TIME OF THIS MEETING 
I THOUGHT JAYNE CLEARED YOUR DIARY 
YES SHE HAD BUT 
ANNE MARIE DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME 
I AM HONOURED GENUINELY HONOURED 
TOUCHED THAT YOU ASKED ME TO BE MEDICAL ADVISOR 
BUT 
BUT 
MY PATIENTS MUST COME FIRST 
AND 
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST AND PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY 
IT'S NOT AS IF I APPLIED FOR THIS POSITION IN THE FIRST PLACE 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
LOOK ER 
I THINK GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
IT MIGHT BE BEST IF WE RESCHEDULED THIS MEETING RE SCHEDULED 
FOUND A BETTER TIME FOR YOU 
THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH POINT IN DISCUSSING ANYTHING IF YOUR MIND IS ELSEWHERE IS THERE 
DO YOU HAVE YOUR DIARY WITH YOU 
NO 
AND AS MRS. GRAYSON HAS POINTED OUT THE TEAM ON A. A. U. 
HAS DEALT EXCEPTIONALLY WELL WITH ALL THE RECENT CHANGES 
I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL VERY HAPPY TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FUNCTION AS A SURGICAL UNIT 
AND GLAD TO HAVE OVERCOME THE CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGES WE FACED 
DURING THE MONTHS OF REFURBISHMENT THANK YOU 
AND OF COURSE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE MR. CULLEN PERFORM AN OPERATION LATER TODAY 
AN OPERATION 
VIA THE NEW VIDEO LINK FACILITY 
WELL THAT ALL DEPENDS DEPENDS 
AS YOU KNOW WE DON'T DO ELECTIVE SURGERY ON A. A. U. ONLY EMERGENCY 
OH I'M CONFIDENT WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU LATER TODAY 
ISN'T THAT RIGHT MR. CULLEN 
YES 
JOSEPH BACK SO SOON 
YOU MOTHER AND I DECIDED TO RE SCHEDULE NOTHING WRONG I HOPE 
NO NO ANYTHING STRANGE OR STARTLING I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT 
MISS FALCONER'S ASKED TO SPEAK TO A CONSULTANT OH YES 
NEITHER OF HER CONDITIONS ARE THAT SEVERE 
I SUGGESTED WE TREAT HER CONSERVATIVELY WITH MEDICATION AND REGULAR FOLLOW UPS 
HOWEVER WHEN I EXPLAINED THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICATION 
MEDICATION WHICH WOULD CURTAIL HER SPORTING AMBITIONS SOMEWHAT 
SHE WAS QUITE UPSET UNDERSTANDABLY 
MR. HOPE'S GONNA GET YOU ALL FIXED UP 
HELLO AGAIN MISS FALCONER 
LIZZIE 
LIZZIE 
SEE SHE'S WEARING A FLOWER 
SORRY FOR DANNY GOLD THE KID THAT WAS SHOT ON THE SPRINGFLOWER ESTATE 
OH YES DANNY GOLD TERRIBLE EVERYONE'S TOTALLY GUTTED ABOUT IT 
ARE YOU A SPRINGFLOWER GIRL 
IT'S ALL RIGHT I WON'T BITE 
I UNDERSTAND YOU WANTED TO SPEAK TO ME ABOUT YOUR CONDITION 
HE SAID I'D HAVE TO STOP COMPETING 
YES I'M AFRAID IF YOU WERE TO HAVE ANOTHER ATTACK 
LIKE THE ONE YOU HAD TODAY YOU'D MOST PROBABLY BE RE ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL 
BUT WHAT ABOUT MY TRIALS RUNNING'S MY LIFE MR. HOPE AND THESE TRIALS ARE MY ONE CHANCE 
I KNOW HOW HARD THIS MUST BE FOR YOU SO THAT'S IT THEN 
DREAM OVER 
THANKS FOR BEING STRAIGHT WITH ME 
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH MISS FALCONER I'M TERRIBLY SORRY 
WON'T BE NEEDING THIS WILL I 
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE

OH I THINK YOUR EX WIFE BEAT YOU TO IT AGAIN 
RIGHT 
OH ER SINCE THE THEATRES ARE CLOSED FOR CLEANING I WAS WONDERING 
IF YOU COULD KEEP AN EYE ON A PATIENT OF MINE MR. HILL 
HE'S IN FOR AN ELECTIVE LAP CHOLE 
BUT POOR GUY'S EPILEPTIC SO JUST WANNA KEEP A WATCH ON HIM 
CAN'T LOLA HANDLE IT 
WOW 
YOU REALLY DEPEND ON HER TO WATCH YOUR BACK DON'T YOU RIC 
COME IN 
MR. HOPE 
LIZZIE UNDERSTANDS MR. HOPE SORRY 
WE WERE TALKING THIS MORNING AND THE THING ABOUT HER IS SHE'S NOT AFRAID 
AFRAID SHE'S BEEN THROUGH SUCH A LOT ALREADY 
PROVING HERSELF TO HER COACH 
TO THE SCHOOL TO THE KIDS ON THE SPRINGFLOWER ESTATE 
APPARENTLY NOBODY EVER WANTED TO GIVE HER MUCH OF A CHANCE 
SHE TOLD YOU THIS 
MM WELL SHE PROVED THEM ALL WRONG DIDN'T SHE 
YOU KNOW WHATEVER HAPPENS SHE'LL UNDERSTAND YOU DID YOUR BEST FOR HER 
I'M SURE REALLY SHE'S A FIGHTER MR. HOPE 
DOUBT THERE'S MUCH THAT COULD HOLD HER BACK 
OF COURSE THERE'S GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTMENT BUT SHE'LL PICK UP HERSELF 
I KNOW SHE WILL KNOWING SHE COULD HAVE BEEN IN THE OLYMPICS 
IT'S THE CARD SHE'S BEEN DEALT 
ALL MAY NOT BE LOST 
WHEN WAS THE MEETING'S AGENDA CHANGED IT WAS VERY LAST MINUTE 
AND THE POST OPERATIVE CARE DISCUSSION WILL BE RESCHEDULED CAN I SPEAK TO YOU LATER 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT MR. CULLEN 
IF I'M HONEST I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED 
BY WHAT WELL THE DELEGATES FOR ONE THING 
THEY'RE JUST THRILLED WITH WHAT YOU HAVE ACHIEVED 
AND THERE WERE TECHNICIANS SETTING UP CAMERAS IN OUR THEATRE 
WELL FOR THE NEW VIDEO LINK UP 
I WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED KNOWING 
I KNOW MASS VISITATIONS ARE VERY DISRUPTIVE 
BUT I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN YOU 
WHAT IF WE DON'T FIND A SUITABLE PATIENT THAT'S HARDLY LIKELY ON A. A. U. IS IT 
IT'S IMPORTANT WE MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION TODAY 
WHY DON'T YOU ENJOY YOUR SUCCESS 
YOU HAVE EARNED IT 
O. K. 
AND YOU THINK THIS KEYHOLE SURGERY WOULD WORK I SEE NO REASON WHY NOT 
AND I'D BE OUT OF HERE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS IF ALL GOES TO PLAN 
THIS MIGHT NOT BE AN APPROPRIATE COURSE OF TREATMENT 
IT'S A LITTLE OUT OF THE ORDINARY AND THEREFORE VERY EXPENSIVE BUT IF THAT'S MY BEST OPTION 
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE FUNDING FOR THIS OPERATION IS THAT RIGHT 
LOOK LIZZIE 
I'M GOING TO TRY AND SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING I CAN DO 
I CAN'T MAKE ANY HARD AND FAST PROMISES DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 
BUT YOU'LL GIVE IT A SHOT I GIVE YOU MY WORD 
MR. HILL'S EPILEPTIC YOU'LL NEED TO CALL NEUROLOGY TO FIND OUT WHAT TREATMENT HE'S ON 
ARE YOU AMERICAN YES I AM 
KNEW LOTS AMERICANS IN KOREA 
ENDED UP IN ONE OF THEIR HOSPITALS 
REALLY JUST LIKE MASH IT WAS 
GOOD DOCTORS THOUGH THOROUGH FIXED UP MY LEG NO PROBLEM 
NOT LIKE THE RABBLE WE GET OVER HERE NOW 
MY DAUGHTER'S A NURSE SOME OF THE STORIES SHE TELLS ME THEY'D MAKE YOUR HAIR CURL 
I ASSURE YOU YOU'RE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE HANDS IS THAT RIGHT ABSOLUTELY 
NOW THOSE YANKS THEY WERE DOCTORS 
THERE WAS THIS ONE GUY LOOKED A BIT LIKE FRANK SINATRA 
USED TO COME INTO THE WARD SINGING 
WELL I'M NOT SURE WE CAN PROMISE YOU A SONG BUT I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN 
I TELL YOU WHAT MR. HILL IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER 
YOU CAN THINK OF ME AS HAWKEYE AND MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE HERE AS RADAR

HANG ON IN THERE MR. ALLERTON

JUST THOUGHT I'D SPREAD THE LOVE 
SO DID YOU FIND OUT WHAT THOSE PEOPLE WERE DOING IN THEATRE 
YES THERE WILL BE DELEGATES FROM THE HEALTH AUTHORITY VISITING A. A. U. TODAY 
ARE WE IN TROUBLE ON THE CONTRARY 
SOMEBODY'S DOING SOMETHING RIGHT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL 
I WAS ONLY SAYING 
THANKS DOCTOR 
WHERE WERE YOU EARLIER 
SOMETHING CAME UP SORRY 
SOMETHING CAME UP 
PLEASE GENUINELY 
WAS THIS SOMETHING TO DO WITH PERCY 
HOW DID THE MEETING GO 
ERIC HOW YOU PUT UP WITH THAT MAN I DO NOT KNOW 
CAN WE JUST LEAVE ABRA OUT OF THIS HOW DID THE MEETING GO 
THERE'S A GROUP FROM THE LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITY TOURING THE HOSPITAL THIS AFTERNOON 
NOBODY TOLD ME

ALL RIGHT I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO 
I WILL GET ONTO IT 
IN YOUR DREAMS MR. CULLEN 
SOMETHING WRONG OUR SAINTED MR. CULLEN SEEMS TO THINK EVERYONE'S AT HIS BECK AND CALL 
SO IF WE SUCCESSFULLY ELIMINATE THE SHORT CIRCUIT THEN IT'S A CASE OF FIXING THE MITRAL VALVE 
VERY EXPENSIVE ELIMINATION A RISKY ONE TOO 
MR. BYRNE WHAT DO YOU THINK IN MY OPINION THIS ISN'T A MEDICAL EMERGENCY 
IT IS FOR LIZZIE WELL THE OPERATION MIGHT BE SUITABLE FOR HER 
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THE GENERATOR 
WE'VE APPLIED FOR THE FUNDING 
THEN SHE'LL HAVE TO WAIT TILL IT COMES THROUGH 
I DON'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER AND ADAM LAST WEEK OR 
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT SHE NEEDS THE OPERATION TODAY 
THEN SPEAK TO MRS. GRAYSON BUT I DON'T THINK SHE'LL GO FOR IT LOOK CONNIE 
SORRY SO WHAT DO I TELL MY PATIENT 
TALK TO JAYNE RIGHT MS. NAYLOR YES MRS. BEAUCHAMP 
I'D LIKE YOU TO GO DOWN TO A. A. U. AND ASSIST MR. CULLEN

MORE SUCTION PLEASE I NEED TO LOCATE THE BLEED BEFORE I CAN REPAIR THE HOLE IN THE DIAPHRAGM 
MAYBE YOU SHOULD EXTEND THE INCISION I THINK IT'S O. K. 
LOOK ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT MS. NAYLOR TO ASSIST 
IT MIGHT BE ADVISABLE FOR ME TO TAKE A LOOK TWO TO ZERO VICRYL AND A ROUND BODIED NEEDLE PLEASE

I JUST THOUGHT 
YOU JUST THOUGHT WHAT 
THAT WITH THE DELEGATES COMING DOWN HE'D WANT THIS PLACE SHIPSHAPE 
FOR WHAT A TICKERTAPE PARADE WHAT IS IT WITH YOU AND DUCKING OUT OF THE GLORY 
I JUST LIKE TO KEEP THINGS ON AN EVEN KEEL UNLESS 
UNLESS WHAT UNLESS IT'S ALL PART OF THE BRILLIANT PLAN 
THE PLAN WHAT PLAN 
MAYBE THERE'S A TOUCH OF THE DAN CLIFFORDS IN YOU AFTER ALL 
SINCE WHEN IS SOMEONE DOING THEIR JOB TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITIES A SIN 
SORRY 
LET'S JUST FOCUS OUR ENERGIES ON THE PATIENTS O. K. I WASN'T BEING COMPLETELY SERIOUS 
NO MR. CULLEN I'VE GOT A VISITOR FOR YOU THIS IS HOLLY FRAIN 
I'M DEAN MICHAELS' FIANCEE RIGHT 
SHE WAS AT RECEPTION AND THEY PAGED ME FOR SOME REASON 
HE'S O. K. ISN'T HE PERHAPS YOU'D WAIT IN HERE HOLLY 
HE'S NOT DEAD IS HE 
NO I JUST NEED TO TALK TO YOU MR. CULLEN 
HAVE YOU A SECOND IT'S IMPORTANT YEAH 
I HAD A WORD WITH MRS. BEAUCHAMP EARLIER RIGHT 
YOU TWO HAVEN'T HAD ANY KIND OF DISAGREEMENT HAVE YOU ABOUT WHAT 
SEARCH ME BUT CONNIE'S GOT A BEE IN HER BONNET ABOUT YOU 
SOMETHING ABOUT NOT BEING THERE TO HOLD YOUR HAND WHENEVER YOU ASK FOR IT 
WHAT'S SHE TALKING ABOUT 
I DON'T KNOW BUT WHATEVER IT IS YOU NEED TO SORT IT 
IT DOESN'T DO TO RUFFLE FEATHERS AROUND HERE 
TAKE IT FROM ME ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE PEDIGREE PLUMAGE 
YOU PROMISED YOU WOULDN'T COME BACK HERE AGAIN ABRA YOU PROMISED 
COULDN'T THINK OF ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO 
WHAT ABOUT A WALK IN CENTRE 
I'M SORRY ALL RIGHT NO IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT 
DID YOU STOP TO THINK HOW IT'S GOING TO LOOK IF LOLA 
LET ALONE JAYNE FINDS YOU HERE OR KYLA 
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO PUT YOUR HAND THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW ANYWAY 
JUST WOULDN'T OPEN AND THAT WAS WHEN YOU TAPPED IT 
WHAT STATE'S THE WINDOW IN NOW 
STILL BROKEN I S'POSE AND YOU WENT OUT AND LEFT IT LIKE THAT 
WHAT ELSE WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO 
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU ABRA 
YOU'RE RIGHT RIC 
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE COME HERE 
AND YOU'RE COMPLETELY CONFIDENT THAT THIS PROCEDURE WILL WORK ELLIOT 
OH YES I MEAN THE INCREDIBLE THING ABOUT THIS KEYHOLE SURGERY IS 
WE CAN OPEN UP A HOLE IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF MISS FALCONER'S CHEST 
MAY I 
THROUGH THERE WE CAN OPEN THE ATRIUM AND LOCATE THE AREA BETWEEN THE RIGHT ATRIUM AND LEFT VENTRICLE 
THEN WE GET THE RADIO FREQUENCY ABLATOR AND BURN THE AREA WHICH IS THEN REPLACED BY FIBROIDS 
THE GENERATOR WILL ALLOW US TO FORGE A RIDGE BETWEEN THE TWO CHAMBERS OF HER HEART 
IT'LL BE COMPLETELY INSULATED SO THE CURRENT WILL PASS THROUGH THE NORMAL ROUTE AND THE MITRAL VALVE 
WELL THAT CAN BE FIXED THROUGH THE SAME OPENING AND REINFORCED WITH A DISSOLVABLE RING 
DISSOLVABLE IT'S BY FAR THE BEST OPTION 
AND GIVEN MISS FALCONER'S YOUTH AND FITNESS IT SHOULD NEVER NEED REPLACING 
WITH LIZZIE'S POTENTIAL PUBLIC PROFILE I CAN'T SEE THIS OPERATION 
BRINGING ANYTHING OTHER THAN GOOD PUBLICITY TO THE BYRNE FOUNDATION 
H. M. M. I DON'T KNOW ELLIOT 
TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS IS AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY 
I THINK WE SHOULD LEAVE DEAN TO GET SOME REST NOW O. K.

I REALLY DO BUT IS IT NECESSARY TO CELEBRATE HIS WORK ALL DAY 
ESPECIALLY AS THE FUNDING'S GOING TO A. A. U. 
YOU NEED TO KEEP ON TOP OF THIS IT PAYS TO KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE BUT YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER 
WELL I'LL BEAR THAT IN MIND DON CORLEONE 
ANY TIME YOU COME

MRS. GRAYSON'S ON HER WAY WHERE'S HOLLY 
I SENT HER TO GET A CUP OF TEA 
I JUST GOT THROUGH TO A DOCTOR WHELAN IN OXFORD AND WHERE'S MR. ALLERTON 
MR. CULLEN 
DOCTOR YOUNG WHERE'S MR. CULLEN 
HE WAS HERE A MINUTE AGO WE'RE EXPECTING A PRIVATE CONFERENCE 
I KNOW HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS MEETING VERY MUCH I'M SURE HE'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE OR TWO 
OBVIOUSLY HE'S OTHERWISE ENGAGED 
SO WHY DON'T WE DECAMP TO DARWIN AND RECONVENE HERE LATER 
EXCUSE ME I'LL MEET YOU UP THERE 
EXCELLENT IDEA MRS. BEAUCHAMP SORRY EVERYONE THIS WAY 
HE'S GONE 
THANK GOD FOR THAT HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU THINK 
YOU KNOW I REALLY DIDN'T GET IT ERIC WHY YOU'RE ALWAYS BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO HELP THAT MAN 
AND THEN IT HIT ME HERE'S PERCIVAL 
A MAN FOR WHOM ALL RELATIONSHIPS END IN DISASTER 
A MAN WHO FINDS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FACE UP TO ANY KIND OF RESPONSIBILITY 
BUT A MAN WHO SOMEHOW THINKS THAT IF HE STRIDES ABOUT LOOKING IMPORTANT ENOUGH 
NO ONE WILL NOTICE THE DISASTER THAT LURKS AT THE HEART OF HIM REMIND YOU OF ANYONE ERIC 
THESE ARE TO GO TO THE SIDE BAY NO PROBLEM 
SO WHERE ARE THESE DELEGATES THEN 
PLEASE SAY WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND JOSEPH 
AS I'VE ALREADY SAID I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS ISN'T A MEDICAL EMERGENCY 
BUT IT'S THE BEST TREATMENT FOR THE PATIENT 
NOT SURE IF THAT'S QUITE THE SAME THING 
SO THE RUMOURS ARE TRUE THEN 
RUMOURS THAT LADY BYRNE STUMPED UP THE CASH 
THE BYRNE FOUNDATION HAS GENEROUSLY AGREED TO FUND THIS OPERATION CONNIE REALLY THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU 
IT'S NICE THAT YOU CAN GO TO HER AS AND WHEN OH AND YOU WOULDN'T WOULD YOU CONNIE 
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT ELLIOT WELL ACTUALLY NO WE'RE A LITTLE CONCERNED 
THAT WE MAY BE SETTING A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT HERE LADY BYRNE IN WHAT WAY

WELL YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE IT'S NOT LIKE THE OPERATION IS AN EMERGENCY 
THAT'S NOT THE CASE ISN'T IT

IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE FUTURE OF CONTEMPORARY LIVING HA 
O. K. I'LL STAY HERE I'LL STAY HERE 
OVER THE YEARS I'VE TRIED TO PUT IT OUT OF MY MIND 
IGNORE ALL THE TERRIBLE STORIES 
THE DRUGS THE MURDERS 
BUT WHEN THAT KID WAS KILLED THE OTHER WEEK 
O. K. LET ME JUST 
LOOK MR. ALLERTON WHEN THINGS GO VERY BADLY WRONG THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS FORGIVE YOURSELF

THAT I DON'T WISH THAT I COULD GO BACK IN TIME 
AND CHANGE SOMETHING 
FIX SOMETHING 
I THOUGHT ABOUT ENDING IT ALL TOO 
IN FACT I THOUGHT ABOUT NOTHING ELSE FOR THE LONGEST POSSIBLE TIME 
EVENTUALLY I HAD TO MAKE A CHOICE 
ACCEPT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO ABOUT WHAT WAS DONE 
AND TRY SOMEHOW TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH MY LIFE 
OR JUST GIVE UP 
I CHOSE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
AND IT WAS THE HARDEST CHOICE I'VE EVER HAD TO MAKE

THERE'S NO NEED TO TALK LIKE THAT 
GET MR. DURANT OUT OF HERE OR I SHALL CALL THE POLICE 
FOR WATCHING TELEVISION 
FOR TRESPASSING TWO MINUTES I'LL GET OFF 
MR. DURANT PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH AN INJURED ARM 
AFTER TREATING THE INJURY I WASN'T COMFORTABLE ABOUT DISCHARGING HIM 
SO YOU HID HIM IN THE BASEMENT 
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT MR. DURANT HAS GIVEN THIS HOSPITAL A GREAT DEAL 
I THINK THAT HE DESERVES TO BE TREATED WITH A LITTLE MORE RESPECT 
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT MR. DURANT WALKED OUT OF THIS HOSPITAL WITHOUT A WORD TO ANYONE 
HE OBVIOUSLY FEELS ABOVE THE RULES AND REGULATIONS WHICH BIND US ALL INCLUDING YOU MR. GRIFFIN 
SO DON'T TRY TO MAKE SOME MORAL CASE FOR HIM NOT TO ME 
SO WHAT NOW WE JUST TURN OUR BACKS ON HIM BECAUSE HE USED SOME INITIATIVE IN TRYING TO HELP OTHERS 
BECAUSE I'D SAY WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
YOU'VE GOT HALF AN HOUR TO GET RID OF HIM 
LOOK AFTER THAT ARM 
QUESTIONS WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS YOU LET ME WORRY ABOUT THEM 
YOU JUST LIE THERE AND GET YOURSELF BETTER

A BRIEF TWO MINUTE SPEECH HOW BAD COULD THAT BE 
SHALL WE 
ANNE MARIE I'M SO SORRY 
I KNOW YOU MUST BE ANGRY WITH ME 
ANGRY WITH YOU AND FEEL VERY LET DOWN 
ON THE CONTRARY 
I'VE MADE A DECISION 
I DON'T THINK I'M CUT OUT FOR THE ROLE OF MEDICAL ADVISER NOT AFTER TODAY'S UNMITIGATED DISASTER 
YOU UNDERESTIMATE YOURSELF NO ANNE MARIE AND YOU MUST ACCEPT MY RESIGNATION 
YOU BELIEVED IN THAT YOUNG GIRL'S FUTURE AND YOU FOUGHT FOR IT

YOUR PASSION YOUR COMMITMENT 
YOUR EXPERTISE 
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN ELLIOT

HIS DEDICATION AND ABOVE ALL HIS INTEGRITY MR. LINDEN CULLEN 
THANK YOU I'LL BE BRIEF I PROMISE 
IT'S VERY EASY TO GET CARRIED AWAY WITH ONESELF IN THIS JOB 
EVERY DAY WE MEDICS ARE BLESSED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE 
EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCES WITH PEOPLE WE MIGHT NEVER NORMALLY MEET 
OF COURSE THERE IS TRAGEDY PAIN AND SICKNESS ALONG THE WAY 
BUT EQUALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THERE IS ALSO HOPE 
SO MUCH SO THAT IT NEVER CEASES TO INSPIRE AND AMAZE ME 
SO SINGLING OUT MYSELF AND MY AMAZING TEAM ON A. A. U. 
THAT'S YOU DOCTOR YOUNG 
IS VERY GRATIFYING AND I TRULY THANK YOU FOR IT 
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE'RE ALL VERY SMALL COGS IN A VERY BIG WHEEL 
BUT THERE'S ONE PERSON THAT DOES STAND OUT AS BEING QUITE SPECIAL 
BOTH AS A PERSON AND AS A PHYSICIAN 
SOME OF YOU TODAY I KNOW SAW HER STEPPING STRAIGHT INTO THE BREACH TO ASSIST DURING AN EMERGENCY 
SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK MRS. BEAUCHAMP TO JOIN US UP HERE 
AND FOR YOU ALL TO RAISE YOUR GLASSES CONNIE BEAUCHAMP 
THANKS 
FOR WHAT 
FOR WHAT YOU SAID BACK THERE 
BUT IT'S PROBABLY TIME I GOT OUT OF YOUR HAIR 
FOUND MYSELF ANOTHER HOTEL 
HOLD ON A MINUTE LET'S NOT MAKE ANY SNAP DECISIONS 
I CAN'T STAY ROUND YOURS INDEFINITELY CAN I 
NO NOT INDEFINITELY LET'S JUST TAKE IT A WEEK AT A TIME 
SEE HOW IT GOES 
BUT YOU'D BETTER SORT THAT ROOM OUT 
WHERE ARE MISS FALCONER'S PARENTS 
STILL WITH LIZZIE DO THEY NEED ME FOR ANYTHING NO IT'S 
IT'S NOT EASY WHAT WE ALL DO 
LIZZIE KNEW YOU DID YOUR BEST FOR HER 
YOU WERE IN IT TOGETHER 
I MIGHT HAVE PUSHED JUST A LITTLE TOO HARD AGAINST THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE 
YOU DID WHAT YOU THOUGHT RIGHT 
AND WE LOST HER AS A CONSEQUENCE 
LOOK MR. HOPE 
YOU BOTH WENT FOR THE GOLD 
LIZZIE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED NO LESS OF HERSELF OR YOU 
SHE WOULD BE ALIVE NOW IF I'D STUCK WITH THE FIRST PROGNOSIS 
SHE'D NEVER HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH THAT IF THERE WAS A CHANCE SHE MIGHT HAVE COMPETED AGAIN 
I KNOW I WOULDN'T 
BUT THAT'S JUST IT 
WE DON'T ANY OF US KNOW 
NOT UNTIL IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT 
SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED YOU TO HAVE THIS THANK YOU 
I OPEN MY EYES ONE TRY TO SEE BUT I'M BLINDED 
BY THE WHITE LIGHT 
I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW I CAN'T REMEMBER WHY 
I'M LYING HERE TONIGHT 
AND I CAN'T STAND THE PAIN 
AND I CAN'T MAKE IT GO AWAY 
NO I CAN'T STAND THE PAIN 
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN TO ME I'VE MADE MY MISTAKES 
GOT NOWHERE TO RUN 
THE NIGHT GOES ON 
AS I'M FADING AWAY 
I'M SICK OF THIS LIFE 
I JUST WANNA SCREAM 
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN 
ESCAPING 
RECEPTIONS AREN'T REALLY MY THING 
GOOD SPEECH INTERESTING
