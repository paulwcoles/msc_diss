IT SAYS HERE THAT STEVE'S YOUR SURROGATE AUNTIE 
OR NEPHEW DEPENDING ON HOW HE'S DRESSING UP BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR REAL FAMILY 
I WAS ADOPTED AS A CHILD AND MY ADOPTIVE FAMILY 
WHICH I WAS BROUGHT UP IN WAS NOT VERY CLOSE 
BUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I DECIDED THAT I'D TRY AND TRACE MY BIRTH FAMILY 
AND I FOUND THAT UNFORTUNATELY MY MUM HAD DIED BUT I HAVE A SISTER THAT I NEVER KNEW I HAD 
SO I'VE NOW GOT A SISTER WHOSE GOT HER FAMILY WHICH IS NOW MY FAMILY SO THAT'S GREAT 
WELL ISN'T THAT LOVELY YEAH 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO COME TO THE MONEY MOMENT 
THREE HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED SMACKERS THERE YOU GO YOU KNOW THE RULES 
YOUR EXPERTS AWAIT YOU'D BETTER GET OUT THERE AND OFF YOU GO 
GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT WE'LL FIND OUT NEXT 
SHE'S NO FEATHERWEIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO ANTIQUES 
THE REDS' EXPERT IS ANITA MANNING AND STALKING THE STREETS FOR 
BARGAINS THE BLUES' HELPER KATE BLISS 
AHH 
AH ANITA THERE YOU ARE 
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU EVERYWHERE WE FOUND THIS 
HOW APPROPRIATE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YES THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WRONG IT'S EMPTY 
WE THOUGHT YOU'D HELP US WITH THAT 
TELL ME WHAT YOU LIKED ABOUT IT 
I THINK THEY'VE COME BACK IN DATE NOW 
WITH THE SIZE OF THE SHOT GLASSES IT WAS AN ATTRACTIVE PIECE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT PERIOD IT IS NO 
NINETEEN FIFTIES YES YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
NOW THIS IS QUITE INTERESTING BECAUSE THE FIFTIES IS BECOMING VERY VERY POPULAR 
IT'S NEVER I'M AFRAID BEEN AN ITEM OF ANY QUALITY AT ALL 
BUT IT DOES REPRESENT THAT AGE AND IT WILL BE BOUGHT FOR ITS STYLE 
IF WE LOOK AT THE GILDING HERE IT'S IN GOOD CONDITION 
SO I DOUBT IF THIS LITTLE DECANTER SET HAS BEEN USED VERY MUCH 
IT'S BEEN MAYBE BOUGHT AS A PRESENT AND THEN PUT AWAY 
HE DID TELL US HE THOUGHT THE GILDING WAS TWENTY FOUR CARAT 
WELL IF YOU BELIEVE THAT 
THAT'S PROBABLY PUT ANOTHER TWENTY QUID ONTO IT 
I QUITE LIKE THIS TRAY 
LET'S HAVE A WEE LOOK 
WE HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES AND RECIPES OF COCKTAILS 
WE HAVE A PARADISE WE HAVE A HULA HULA AND WE HAVE A CORPSE REVIVER 
WHICH IS WHAT I'M HAVING JUST NOW 
YOU TWO OBVIOUSLY THINK IT'S BAGS OF FUN BUT IT WILL DEPEND ON THE PRICE 
THE PRICE HE WANTS ONE HUNDRED TEN FOR IT 
ONE HUNDRED TEN 
NO NO THAT'S CRAZY 
IT'S GOT BAGS OF STYLE I LIKE IT BUT TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF A PROFIT 
WE'VE REALLY GOT TO GET THAT RIGHT DOWN 
BEFORE WE GO THOUGH I THINK I'LL FINISH MY WEE DRAM 
WOULD YOU TWO LIKE ONE 
TOP NOTCH HAGGLING 
THEY GOT THE COCKTAIL SET FOR SIXTY AND BY THE WAY MINE'S A GIN AND TONIC 
CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING HOPEFULLY A LOT OF PROFIT KATE 
NO SERIOUSLY DOES IT WORK 
I THINK SO YEAH I JUST NEED TO ADJUST THE FOCUS ON IT 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON LET'S HAVE A CLOSER LOOK IT'S BEEN USED A LOT 
THE LEATHER'S REALLY QUITE WORN 
BUT IT GIVES IT THAT NICE PERIOD LOOK 
TURN OF THE CENTURY 
PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT JUST ONE THING IT'S NOT A FOLDING TELESCOPE 
IT'S FIXED IN THIS POSITION ISN'T IT APART FROM THE FOCUS 
AND WE'VE GOT A LITTLE ATTACHMENT JUST UP HERE 
I WONDER IF THIS HAS COME OFF A BIGGER INSTRUMENT IN SHORT 
SO BEAR THAT IN MIND IT'S A BIT TOO BIG FOR YOUR POCKET ISN'T IT YES 
BUT THERE'S A NAME I THINK IT SAYS F. DAVIDSON AND AMP COMPANY LONDON WELL SPOTTED 
THAT'S NICE HAVING A LONDON NAME AND THE PATENT NUMBER JUST GIVES IT A LITTLE BIT EXTRA 
O. K. THAT'S QUITE NICE HAVING THAT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK JEN 
IT'S A BIT OF A BOYS' TOY I DO IT'S DIFFERENT 
NOW IT'S SIXTY FIVE THAT'S QUITE A LOT FOR AUCTION 
I CAN SEE THIS REALLY AT SORT OF THIRTY FORTY 
SO IF YOU LIKE IT WHY DON'T YOU GO AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO 
YEAH I DO LIKE IT BUT I AGREE IT IS A LITTLE BIT PRICEY WHAT DO YOU THINK JEN 
I THINK IF YOU CAN GET THEM DOWN A BIT YOU RECKON 
TRY IT COULD BE QUITE QUIRKY SHALL I TRY YEAH 
GO ON GIVE IT YOUR BEST O. K. HERE I GO 
SO IS HE ANY GOOD AT BARGAINING OH YES HE LIKES THAT SORT OF THING HE'S NOT SHY ABOUT THINGS 
AYE AYE 
THE BRASS TELESCOPE CAME IN AT FORTY FIVE 
DON'T WORRY I HAVEN'T LOST MY MARBLES I HAVE DISCOVERED MY PORRINGER 
SO WHAT'S A PORRINGE ACTUALLY IT'S A DRINKING VESSEL 
A DESCRIPTION TYPICALLY APPLIED TO A SEVENTEENTH CENTURY DRINKING VESSEL 
IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED IN A FAMILY KNEES UP AROUND ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY 
YOU'D HAVE PUT YOUR SPECIAL GROG INSIDE AND THEN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
PASSED FROM PERSON TO PERSON AROUND THE PARTY AND THEY WOULD HAVE DRUNK YOUR HEALTH 
NOW THIS EXAMPLE IS MADE IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS A SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ONE 
IT'S A SIMPLE OUTLINE IT'S BEEN PLANISHED THAT MEANS ALL THESE 
LITTLE TINY DENTS WHERE IT'S BEEN RAISED BY HAND OUT OF A SINGLE SHEET HAVE BEEN LEFT 
IT'S GOT TWO TYPICAL CAST STRAP HANDLES 
IN THE OUTLINE OF A SNAKY DRAGON WITH ITS ENTWINED TAIL 
IT'S GOT A CARTOUCHE WHICH IS NOT ENGRAVED 
ACTUALLY CHASED WHICH IS THE WAY THEY DID IT IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
ALL ROUND IT'S A THOROUGHLY DELIGHTFUL EXAMPLE 
IT'S HEAVY THAT MEANS IT'S THICK GAUGE SILVER 
IT WAS EXPENSIVE WHEN IT WAS MADE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE HALLMARKS IT'S HALLMARKED FOR LONDON NINETEEN TWENTY ONE 
AND INDEED INSIDE THE CARTOUCHE IT SAYS G. W. NINETEEN TWENTY TWO 
SO IT WAS MADE JUST BEFORE IT WAS PRESENTED 
NOW IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE G. W. NINETEEN TWENTY TWO THE GAUGE OR WEIGHT OF THIS PIECE 
OF SILVER IS SUFFICIENT THAT YOU COULD SIMPLY HAVE IT POLISHED OUT 
NOW THIS PORRINGER IF IT WAS OF SEVENTEENTH CENTURY DATE SAY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY OR ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY 
WOULD BE WORTH BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED 
BUT THIS ONE IS AVAILABLE HERE IN THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED 
THAT I TELL YOU IS NOTHING WHATSOEVER 
IN FACT I FEEL LIKE TAKING A BIT OF A SIP MYSELF SO I THINK I WILL 
CHEERS 
AH GIRLS HEY 
HAVE A LOOK I FOUND THIS I THINK IT'S GREAT 
OH ISN'T THAT LOVELY IT'S FULL OF POSTCARDS AS WELL 
I THINK THIS IS A LOVELY THING AND I LOVE THESE PEOPLE LOVE TO BROWSE 
THROUGH AND LOOK AT PHOTOGRAPHS FROM BYGONE AGES AND IT'S A WEE BIT OF SOCIAL HISTORY 
THEY LIKE TO LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE ARE WEARING THEIR HAIR DOS 
THEIR EXPRESSIONS THEIR DEMEANOUR AND SO ON 
YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE COSTUMES THAT'S THERE THAT'S RIGHT 
THEY LIKE PRETTY GIRLS 
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING TO SEE THAT'S THE SORT OF HAIR DO THAT FOLK 
HAD IN LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY AND A YOUNG SOLDIER 
AND WHAT YEAR WOULD THESE BE 
WELL THE BOOK DATES FROM I WOULD SAY THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTIES TO THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS 
SO LATE VICTORIAN EARLY EDWARDIAN 
AND YOU CAN TELL THIS BY THE DRESS THAT THEY'RE WEARING 
NOW I WOULD JUDGE THAT THERE WERE OVER TWO HUNDRED PHOTOGRAPHS IN THIS ALBUM 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT CONDITION 
THE CONDITION IS VERY VERY GOOD 
THE PHOTOGRAPHS ARE GOOD AND THE MOUNTS ARE GOOD IN THE INTERIOR 
YEAH AND THAT'S QUITE RARE 
IF WE CLOSE IT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE EXTERIOR 
NOW THESE ARE NORMALLY IN LEATHER 
THIS ONE IS IN A PURPLE VELVET I LIKE THAT 
I REALLY LIKE IT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S LOVELY IT'S A LOVELY BOOK 
BUT THE CONDITION WOULD IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
THERE IS SOME DAMAGE HERE ON THE SPINE BUT THAT BACK SPINE IS QUITE EASILY REPAIRED 
IT FITS WELL IT FITS BACK TOGETHER WELL UH HUH 
HOW MUCH ARE THEY LOOKING FOR IT NINETY NINETY 
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THAT DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY 
COME ON CHAPS WE'VE WORK TO DO 
LET'S GO LET'S GO 
THE REDS SNAPPED UP THE PHOTO COLLECTION FOR SEVENTY QUID 
HERE DO YOU LIKE THIS IT'S BRASS A LETTER CLIP YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU THINK TO THIS I REALLY LIKE THIS WHAT'S THAT JEN 
IT'S AN INKWELL BUT IT'S A DOUBLE ONE WHICH I THINK IS QUITE UNUSUAL 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SILVER BUT KATE WILL KNOW 
LET'S JUST HAVE A LITTLE LOOK AND I'M LOOKING FOR A HALLMARK FOR ENGLISH SILVER 
AROUND HERE AND AROUND THE RIM AND I THINK THIS IS SILVER PLATE 
I'M SURE IT'S SILVER PLATE RIGHT RIGHT 
WHICH MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE TO THE VALUE OF COURSE YEAH 
THE NICE THING IS THE QUALITY OF THE EMBOSSING WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE ON THE LIDS 
IT'S A NEAT PIECE FOR A DESK 
AND WE'VE GOT INITIALS ON THIS ONE AND THE DATE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINE ON THIS ONE 
SO WE KNOW ITS RIGHT AT THE END OF VICTORIA'S REIGN AND IT'S QUITE NICE 
BECAUSE IT JUST GIVES IT A BIT OF CHARACTER 
IT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN A PRESENT FROM HUSBAND TO WIFE OR A MARRIAGE GIFT 
ISN'T THERE A CHIP ON THERE 
I DID NOTICE THAT WELL SPOTTED 
THAT DOES REALLY LET IT DOWN AND THE FACT IT'S SILVER PLATE RATHER THAN SILVER 
YOU'VE GOT TO REALLY TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT INTO THE PRICE 
I COULD ASK HIM IF WE COULD GET SOMETHING OFF THE PRICE IT'S SEVENTY FIVE WHICH I THINK IS HIGH 
I DO AGREE SEVENTY FIVE IS A BIT STEEP 
WHAT SHOULD WE GO FOR WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WELL AT AUCTION I CAN REALLY SEE IT AT THIRTY TO FIFTY BUT IT'S A NICE THING SO IT'S UP TO YOU 
WHAT ABOUT THE PRICE 
I THINK IT'S A CASE OF GETTING HIM DOWN TO AS LOW AS I CAN FOLLOWING ON WHAT KATE SAID 
SHE'S A GOOD GIRL IT'S YOUR ITEM WE'LL GIVE YOU THE MORAL SUPPORT 
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT O. K. HERE WE GO LET'S GO COME ON 
AND GO FOR IT SHE DID HAGGLING THE INKWELL DOWN TO FORTY FIVE 
LOOK AT THIS BITS OF MONEY 
WHAT DOES THAT REMIND YOU OF 
YOU'RE RIGHT LEFTOVER LOLLY THOSE BITS OF MONEY WHICH THE TEAMS DON'T SPENT WHEN SHOPPING WILL 
BE GIVEN TO THEIR EXPERT TO FIND A BONUS BUY WHICH THEY'LL SELL LATER 
AT AUCTION AND HOPEFULLY BOOST THEIR TEAM'S PROFITS HOW ABOUT THAT 
ANITA WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS I LOVE THE COLOUR 
SHEILA I THINK YOU AND I HAVE THE SAME TASTE I THINK THIS IS WONDERFUL LOVELY ISN'T IT 
YES IT'S POOLE POTTERY ONE OF MY FAVOURITES AND THEY MADE SOME WONDERFUL POTS IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THEY CHANGED THEIR STYLE AGAIN AND MADE THESE 
WONDERFUL COLOUR MODERNISTIC POTS CHARGERS PLATES AND SO ON 
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THEY CAME BACK AGAIN AND DID THIS TYPE OF WARE 
THIS DESIGN WAS BASED ON A PATTERN FROM THE SIXTIES CALLED DELPHUS 
NOW THIS PARTICULAR PATTERN IS CALLED VOLCANO AND WE ONLY NEED TO LOOK AT IT TO KNOW WHY 
AND I THINK THAT THIS TYPE OF THING HAS POTENTIAL 
TONY WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IF IT'S THAT AGE IT'S AN ANTIQUE FOR THE FUTURE 
SO IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO START COLLECTING START HERE IT'S LOVELY YOU COULDN'T MISS IT 
YOU COULDN'T MISS IT YEAH TELL ME WHY YOU LIKE IT 
I LIKE THE COLOUR I LIKE THE SHAPE I LIKE THE TEXTURE OF IT AND PLUS IT'S POOLE POTTERY 
YES PRICE HOW MUCH 
SIXTY FIVE DO YOU THINK WE CAN GET DOWN A WEE BIT I ALREADY HAVE 
OH YOU ARE A CLEVER GIRL 
HOW MUCH DID YOU GET FOR IT FIFTY 
I THINK WE'VE GOT A CHANCE LET'S GO 
SO WILL THE POOLE POTTERY VOLCANO DISH ERUPT AT AUCTION FIFTY PAID 
THERE'S A LOT OF SILVER PLATE ALONG HERE BUT THIS 
IS IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LEAGUE 
LOOK AT THE DECORATION ON THAT IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL 
YES IT'S PRETTY WHAT YEAR IS THAT GOING TO BE THEN 
THIS IS TYPICALLY VICTORIAN 
IT'S QUITE RESTRAINED IT'S QUITE NEOCLASSICAL IN SHAPE IT'S WHAT WE CALL A PEDESTAL BASKET 
YOU COULD PUT SUGAR LUMPS IN IT TODAY OR ANYTHING YOU LIKE REALLY SO YOU COULD ACTUALLY USE IT 
AND REALLY IT SHOUTS QUALITY TO ME IT'S A REALLY NICE PIECE OF SILVER 
YOU'VE GOT PIERCED DECORATION HERE WHICH IS ENGRAVED AND BEAUTIFULLY TRACED 
YOU'VE GOT THIS TRELLIS FLOWER AND LEAFAGE WORK 
AND THEN SOME ENGINE TURNING ON THE BORDERS HERE ALL REALLY BEAUTIFULLY DONE 
BEADED BORDER AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN THE HANDLE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE SEPARATELY IN A SILVERSMITH'S 
WORKSHOP BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT A HALLMARK ON THAT TO MATCH 
CAN YOU SEE THERE'S A LITTLE MARK ON THE INSIDE THERE AND THEN THE MARK ON THE OUTSIDE JUST HERE 
IT'S IN AMAZING CONDITION REALLY CONSIDERING ITS AGE AND IS THIS DATED FOR ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR 
IS THAT ITS ORIGINAL BLUE DISH INSIDE ITS LINER I THINK IT IS JEN DEFINITELY 
IT FITS NICELY IT'S THE RIGHT COLOUR IT'S A GOOD HEAVY QUALITY TO MATCH THE SILVER 
WELL IT'S A FANTASTIC ITEM BUT HOW MUCH IS IT 
WELL THERE ISN'T A PRICE ON IT BUT I THINK 
LET ME GO AND SEE IF I CAN FIND THE DEALER SEE HOW MUCH THEY WANT 
SEE IF I CAN NEGOTIATE A GOOD PRICE BUT AT AUCTION I CAN SEE THIS MAKING ANYTHING FROM 
ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MAYBE MORE IF TWO PEOPLE REALLY LIKE IT 
I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR IT IF IT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE 
YOU CAN SEE THE QUALITY IN IT 
DEFINITELY VERY GOOD QUALITY 
GIVE IT A TRY SEE WHAT YOU CAN GET 
SEE WHAT THEY SAY I'LL GIVE IT MY BEST SHOT BRILLIANT 
KATE'S VERY KEEN ON THE SWEET BASKET THEY ENDED UP PAYING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOR IT

YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THAT 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SPEND IT ON 
WE'LL WAIT AND SEE I'LL GO FORAGING 
ENOUGH OF THIS BARGAIN DIGGING I'M GOING TO DIG UP A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY 
TUCKED AWAY IN A LUSH SURREY VALLEY IN THE SLEEPY VILLAGE OF COMPTON IS 
THE ONLY PURPOSE BUILT ART GALLERY IN THE COUNTRY DEVOTED TO THE WORK OF ONE MAN IT'S THE WATTS GALLERY 
GEORGE FREDERICK WATTS OCCUPIES A UNIQUE PLACE IN THE HISTORY 
OF ENGLISH PAINTING HAILED AS ENGLAND'S PAINTER PHILOSOPHER 
IN HIS OWN LIFETIME HE WAS REGARDED AS THE GREATEST PAINTER OF THE VICTORIAN AGE 
AND TO HIS CONTEMPORARIES HE WAS REFERRED TO AS IL SIGNOR 
THIS STRIKING ARTS AND CRAFTS GALLERY 
OPENED TO THE PUBLIC IN NINETEEN OH FOUR BUT SADLY TWO MONTHS LATER WATTS DIED 
WATTS'S LIFE SPANNED THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
BUT IN NO WAY COULD HE BE REGARDED AS A TYPICAL VICTORIAN 
IN FACT HIS EARLY AND FORMATIVE YEARS ARTISTICALLY SPEAKING WERE SPENT IN EUROPE 
AND IN THIS SELF PORTRAIT WE CAN SEE HIM LOOKING PARTICULARLY ITALIAN 
AROUND THE CORNER WE'VE GOT THE MOST MARVELLOUS 
EXAMPLE OF A PAINTING FROM HIS EARLY ITALIAN PERIOD 
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS MONUMENTAL PICTURE WHICH IS ENTITLED ECHO 
IT HAS EVERY RESEMBLANCE OF BEING AN OLD MASTER PICTURE 
YOU CAN ALMOST SEE SOME TITIANESQUE QUALITIES 
IN THIS ATTRACTIVE FLESHY CREATURE WAITING IN THE FOREGROUND 
BUT JUST LOOK AT THAT EXTENSIVE VALLEY WHICH LEADS TOWARDS THOSE MURKY MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE 
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY OLD MASTER IN INSPIRATION 
THERE SHE STANDS WAITING PENSIVELY FOR HER ECHO ECHO ECHO 
WHEN WATTS RETURNED FROM ITALY 
HE FOUND THAT THE ECHO STYLE ITALIAN PAINTING WAS DEEPLY UNFASHIONABLE 
IN FACT THE ARTISTS PRODUCING THAT SORT OF WORK WERE RIDICULED 
NOT SURPRISINGLY HE BECAME RATHER DEPRESSED 
BUT HE SOON CHANGED HIS STYLE AND INTRODUCED THIS TYPE OF PAINTING 
KNOWN AS HIS SOCIAL PAINTINGS 
THE ONE DOWN BELOW IS ENTITLED FOUND DROWNED 
THIS IS A HORRIFYING SCENE THIS YOUNG GIRL PERHAPS TOOK HER LIFE 
AS A RESULT OF SOCIAL PRESSURE FOLLOWING AN UNWANTED PREGNANCY 
THE PAINTING UP ABOVE REPRESENTS ANOTHER DESPERATE SCENE AS A RESULT 
OF THE IRISH FAMINE BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY FIVE AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY 
WHEN THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TREATED UTTERLY CALLOUSLY 
THE INHABITANTS OF IRELAND AND WATTS THOUGHT THAT WAS DESPERATELY WRONG 
BUT DID THESE PAINTINGS PAY THE BILLS NO NO 
HIS BREAD AND BUTTER ART REVOLVED AROUND PORTRAITURE 
HERE WE HAVE TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE HUNDREDS OF 
PORTRAITS THAT HE PAINTED OF RICH AND FAMOUS PERSONAGES 
AND THE LAST STRAND OR STYLE IN WATTS'S OEUVRE OF PAINTINGS ARE HIS ALLEGORICAL ONES 
AND THIS PICTURE ENTITLED PROGRESS TYPIFIES THIS STYLE 
WE'VE GOT A COSMIC EXPLOSION IN THE SKY 
EMBLEMATIC OF ALL THAT CHANGE THAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
AND ALL THAT OPPORTUNITY AS A RESULT OF CONTINUING CHANGES INTO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
DOWN BELOW WE'VE GOT THREE FIGURES 
A BEARDED ELDERLY SCHOLAR AND A BEAUTIFULLY CLOTHED RICH MAN NEITHER OF THEM 
TAKING ANY NOTICE OF THIS EXPLOSION ABOVE THEM 
THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS TAKING ANY NOTICE IS THE BEGGAR HE'S TURNING 
HIS HEAD UP SEEING THIS ALLEGORY OF PROGRESS AND HE'S MAKING NOTE 
THE MESSAGE BEING THAT IF YOU DO KEEP YOUR EYE OPEN 
IF YOU ARE FLEXIBLE IF YOU ARE PREPARED TO TAKE ON BOARD CHANGE THINGS WILL IMPROVE 
IN EFFECT OPPORTUNITY WILL KNOCK 
THE BIG QUESTION IS WILL OPPORTUNITY KNOCK 
FOR OUR CONTESTANTS TODAY OVER AT THE AUCTION 
IT'S EXTREMELY NICE TO BE AT LAWRENCE'S SALE ROOM IN BLETCHINGLY 
IN SURREY WITH ROBIN LAWRENCE OUR AUCTIONEER GOOD MORNING ROBIN 
GOOD MORNING TIM NOW FIRST UP FOR ALAN AND SHEILA 
IS THIS TRULY HIDEOUS DECANTER SET 
I AGREE WITH YOU IT'S NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR ME 
NOT EVEN SURE THAT THE GLASSES AND THE DECANTER 
STARTED LIFE WITH THE TRAY THAT THEY'RE ON 
JUST A COBBLED TOGETHER THING 
I'M AFRAID IT IS RATHER AND WE THINK TWENTY TO FORTY MIGHT BE POSSIBLE 
SIXTY PAID YOU SEE 
NOW STUFF CONNECTED WITH DRINK PARTICULARLY COCKTAILS 
I'VE NOTICED HAS GONE UP CONSIDERABLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT A BORING GLASS TRAY 
IN A RUBBED GILT METAL FRAME WITH NON MATCHING GLASSES AND A DECANTER 
I DON'T THINK STANDS A SNOWFLAKE 
I DON'T THINK IT DOES YES ANYWAY WITHOUT BEING SCRATCHY ABOUT IT 
THE NEXT ITEM HAPPENS TO BE SOMETHING THAT I REALLY HATE 
WHAT I REALLY HATE IS THE TEXTURE 
IT FEELS GRUBBY AND DIRTY WHEN YOU OPEN IT UP BOOM 
THE WHOLE BACK FALLS OFF IT 
IT'S FULL OF VERY BORING PHOTOGRAPHS OF SOMEBODY ELSE'S RELATIONS 
NOTHING INTERESTING IN THE WAY OF PHOTOGRAPHS IT'S A FILTHY COVER 
AND IT'S FALLING APART I THINK YOU'VE SUMMED IT UP ENTIRELY 
WOULD YOU PAY SEVENTY FOR THAT IN THE HOPE OF MAKING A PROFIT AT AUCTION I WOULDN'T NO 
I'M THINKING TWENTY TO FORTY 
AND IF THAT HAPPENS I TELL YOU NOBODY'S GOING TO BLAME YOU 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE THAT SEVENTY COULD HAVE BEEN PAID 
IT DOES SEEM A BIT STRONG ON THE OTHER HAND TO COMPLETE 
THE TRIO AT LEAST WE'VE GOT A BIT OF POOLE POTTERY HERE WHICH SEEMS TO BE IN REASONABLE NICK 
IT'S IN VERY GOOD CONDITION AND A NICE FUNKY MODERN LOOKING DESIGN 
THERE'S A BIT OF HOPE FOR THAT ONE AND IT'S A KNOWN PRODUCT TOO 
YES IT'S POOLE'S VOLCANO PATTERN YOU CAN SEE THERE THE FIERY COLOURS IN THE PALETTE 
WE THINK FIFTY TO EIGHTY SHOULD BE POSSIBLE 
FANTASTIC WELL THEY PAID FIFTY FOR IT SO THERE IS AT LEAST A LITTLE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL 
THAT THEY MIGHT MAKE A SMALL PROFIT ON THIS BUT THE OTHER TWO ITEMS ARE PRETTY CERTAIN TO BE DEAD LOSSES 
SO THEY'LL NEED THEIR BONUS BUY AND WE OUGHT TO GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
NOW SHEIL A. L. S. YOU GAVE ANITA ONE HUNDRED TWENTY WHAT DID SHE SPEND IT ON 
O. K. ANITA REVEAL ALL DARLING AAH 
NOT WHAT I EXPECTED 
WHAT IS IT 
IT'S NICE TO HAVE A SURPRISE 
YES WELL IT'S A LOVELY LITTLE VICTORIAN 
BOX SET OF SILVER PLATED SALTS AND SPOONS PERIOD ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY IT'S NICE THAT IT'S STILL IN THE ORIGINAL FITTED BOX 
WE HAVE THESE BUCKET SHAPED SALTS WHICH I THINK ARE VERY NICE 
THEY'RE IN GOOD CONDITION THEY MAY HAVE BEEN REGILDED 
AND YOU'VE GOT THESE SWEET LITTLE SHELL SHAPED SPOONS 
SO ALL SET UP FOR A GROUP OF FOUR PEOPLE AROUND A DINING TABLE THEN 
WHICH IS REALLY RATHER SWEET 
DO YOU WANT TO JUST PASS THEM OVER ANITA BECAUSE THAT IS A VERY HANDSOME BOX ISN'T IT 
WITH THAT GREEN LINING AND ALL THE REST OF IT I LIKE THESE 
IT'S AN ATTRACTIVE LITTLE OUTING IT IS THEY'RE SILVER PLATE YOU SAY 
SILVER PLATE THEY'D MAKE A NICE GIFT AND THEY WOULDN'T BE OUT OF FASHION TO MAKE A GIFT NOW 
I DON'T THINK SO NO I MEAN WE ALL NEED TO EAT SALT HOW MUCH DID IT COST I WAS THINKING THAT 
STRAIGHT TO THE POINT SHEIL EH 
HOW MUCH SORRY 
I PAID THIRTY FIVE FOR THEM 
YOU PAID THIRTY FIVE WELL THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD BUY ISN'T IT WOULD IT MAKE A PROFIT THOUGH 
I WOULD HOPE SO WHAT TEN OR FIFTEEN DO YOU THINK I WOULD ESTIMATE THEM PERHAPS 
AT FORTY TO SIXTY THAT'S THE ESTIMATE I WOULD PUT ON THEM 
SO THERE MAYBE TEN TO TWENTY PROFIT ON IT BUT ANYWAY IT ALL DEPENDS ON QUITE WHERE YOU ARE 
AFTER THE SALE OF YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS RIGHT THAT'S THE MOMENT YOU'LL DECIDE 
BUT FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS 
SO THERE WE GO NICE LITTLE CASED UP SET LOOK 
LITTLE SET OF SILVER SALTS IF THEY WERE SOLID SILVER WE COULD PROBABLY EXPECT 
ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOR THOSE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS SET ARE SILVER PLATED 
AND THE FOURTH SPOON IN THE SET IS IN PIECES INSIDE ONE OF THE SALTS THERE 
SO ON THAT BASIS WE'RE THINKING ONLY TWENTY TO FORTY 
SHE ONLY PAID THIRTY FIVE SO THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE THERE MAY BE 
I THINK THEY'RE RATHER SWEET BUT IT MAY WELL BE ALL THE MONEY 
SO THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS NOW FOR THE BLUES 
THE LEATHER AND BRASS TELESCOPE THAT HAS A MILITARY FEEL TO IT DOESN'T IT 
I THINK VERY MUCH SO YES THE LEATHER COVERING TO THE BARRELS 
WOULD INDICATE PERHAPS FIRST WORLD WAR PERIOD A GUNNERY SITE OF SOME KIND 
IT'S IN A REASONABLE STATE THOUGH ISN'T IT YES AND THERE'S USUALLY INTEREST 
IN SCIENTIFIC AND MILITARY ITEMS SO WE THINK TWENTY TO FORTY FORTY FIVE PAID 
NEXT IS THE DOUBLE INKWELL QUITE NICE TO HAVE TWO POTS IN ONE 
IT IS UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A FEW PROBLEMS FIRSTLY WE WOULD EXPECT IT TO BE SILVER 
BUT THE LIDS ON THIS ARE SILVER PLATE AND ON CLOSE EXAMINATION IT APPEARS 
THAT THEY DON'T QUITE MATCH SO I'M WONDERING WHETHER IT'S A MADE UP ITEM 
COUPLE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT THERE'S A RATHER NASTY BRUISE ON THE CORNER HERE YES 
BRUISE IS AN AUCTIONEERING WORD FOR A CHIP YES I THINK ONLY TWENTY OR FORTY IS GOING TO BE ACHIEVABLE 
O. K. FORTY FIVE PAID AND YOU MIGHT STRUGGLE AT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MIGHTN'T YOU IT IS POSSIBLE IN THAT CONDITION 
YEAH I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHO'S GOING TO WANT 
A PLATED COVERED DOUBLE INKWEL NO IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE TO SELL 
NOW WHAT ABOUT THIS LITTLE PIERCED SWEETMEAT BASKET GEORGIAN IN STYLE ISN'T IT 
GEORGIAN IN STYLE BUT VICTORIAN PERIOD HAS ITS ORIGINAL BLUE GLASS LINER 
IT'S A GOOD SOLID THING AND SHOULD FIND A READY MARKET AT AROUND EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
OH DEAR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THEY PAID FOR THAT THAT'S NOT SO SWEET 
NO NO ABSOLUTELY NOT O. K. FINE WELL THERE'S A BIT OF A HOLE THERE 
THEY MAY NOT DO TOO BADLY BUT I THINK THEY'LL NEED THEIR BONUS BUY LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
NOW JEN AND STEVEN YOU SPENT TWO HUNDRED FORTY YOU GAVE KATE SIXTY SMACKERS YES 
LET'S SEE WHAT SHE SPENT IT ON 
O. K. THERE IT IS 
OH WOW NOW THIS IS A VICTORIAN LITTLE SOVEREIGN CASE AND IF I TURN IT OVER LIKE THAT 
WE CAN SEE WE PRESS THE TOP AND IT OPENS UP 
AND THAT'S WHERE THE VICTORIAN GENT WOULD KEEP HIS SOVEREIGN 
THAT JUST DEPRESSES AND THE LITTLE COIN WOULD GO IN THERE 
NOW THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY NICE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE HEAD HERE 
ON THE INSIDE WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT MORE UNUSUAL 
IT LOOKS LIKE A SOVEREIGN DOESN'T IT IT DOES 
IT LOOKS AS IF THERE IS ONE IN THERE WHICH IS A NICE FEATURE 
AND NOT ONE THAT YOU SEE ON EVERY SOVEREIGN CASE 
TYPICALLY VICTORIAN DECORATION WE'VE GOT EMBOSSING HERE OF LEAFAGE SCROLLS 
WHAT WE CALL A LITTLE VACANT CARTOUCHE 
THIS COULD HAVE INITIALS ENGRAVED ON IT JUST TO PERSONALISE IT 
NOW THIS IS SILVER GILT RATHER THAN GOLD SO IT'S SILVER WITH A LAYER OF GILT OVER THE TOP 
IF YOU LOOK INSIDE YOU SEE THAT THE GILT 
IS STILL IN LOVELY CONDITION YOU SEE HOW BRIGHT IT IS IT IS BRIGHT 
SO DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOOK IT'S PRETTY LOVELY IT IS NICE 
DO YOU WANT TO POP IT OPEN JUST LIKE A LOCKET UNTIL YOU OPEN IT 
JUST LIKE A LOCKET I LIKE THAT SO YOU SPENT THE SIXTY ON IT NO I SPENT FORTY 
NOT BAD I LIKE IT 
A BARGAIN HAVE A QUICK LOOK DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT 
THAT'S THE ULTIMATE QUESTION ISN'T IT REALLY 
AT FORTY I THINK THERE'S A CHANCE IF IT WAS GOLD RATHER THAN SILVER GILT IT WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY 
MORE EXPENSIVE SO THIS IS JUST A MORE AFFORDABLE EXAMPLE 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT IT 
THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW MANY SOVEREIGNS WILL IT BRING IN THE AUCTION DO YOU THINK 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS ONE INSIDE BUT THIS IS A DUMMY COIN WHICH IS A NICE LITTLE DECORATIVE FEATURE 
BUT THE THING WHICH IS GOING TO AFFECT THE VALUE OF THIS IS 
UNLIKE MOST THAT YOU COME ACROSS IT ISN'T SILVER NO IT'S GILDED METAL 
YOU CAN PICK SILVER ONES UP FOR FORTY OR FIFTY SO I THINK PERHAPS THIS MIGHT ONLY BRING TEN OR TWENTY 
REALLY FORTY PAID NOW KATE IS USUALLY PRETTY HOT ON HER LITTLE SILVER ITEMS 
I WONDER WHETHER TODAY SHE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO DIG HERSELF A LITTLE BIT OF A HOLE THERE 
ANYWAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR OPINION ROBIN THAT'S ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
THE SALE WILL START IN A MOMENT GOOD LUCK UP THERE ON THE ROSTRUM

I DIDN'T HAVE TIME I WOULD HAVE HAD THE FULL LOT OTHERWISE 
THE FULL MONTY YEP 
I THINK YOUR LOTS ARE LOOKING WHAT THEY USED TO CALL INTERESTING REALLY 
BECAUSE THE TWO OF YOU GUYS RIGHT YOU FOUND THAT GILT TRAY RIGHT WITH THE COCKTAIL RECIPES ON 
I'M AFRAID THE AUCTIONEER DOESN'T THINK THAT THE DECANTER AND GLASSES MATCH THE TRAY 
AND HE'S BEEN A BIT SNIFFY ABOUT IT HE'S PUT TWENTY TO FORTY ON IT
