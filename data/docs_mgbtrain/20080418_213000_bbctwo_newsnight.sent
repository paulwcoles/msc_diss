IN A SPIN HOW DOES THE P. M. TALK 
ABOUT A NEW WORLD ORDER WHEN THE 
TEN P. TAX REBELLION IS SHAPING UP 
HERE AT HOME 
TONIGHT IN BOSTON THE PM'S BEEN 
CALLING FOR GLOBAL CO OPERATION AS 
BROWN HEADS HOME THERE'S LITTLE TO 
BE FOUND A GROUNDSWELL OF REBELLION 
AGAINST THE P. M.'S TAX PLAN 
THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND GETS 
READY TO ASK SHAREHOLDERS FOR TEN 
BILLION 
I LONG AGO GAVE UP BILLION EXPECTING ANSWERS FROM GOVERNMENT 
DEPARTMENTS BUT I LIKE TO SEE 
OCCASIONALLY THE QUESTION THE THE DEBUNKER OF HUMBUG WE PAY TRIBUTE 
TO A FORMIDABLE PARLIAMENTARIAN 
AND ON NEWSNIGHT TONY PARSONS AND 
JULIE MYERSON AND JOE QUEENAN A 
ROMANTIC COMEDY FROM MIKE LEIGH 
AND HOW JAMES BOND WAS FORGED IN 
WARTIME SPYING 
COLIN FARRELL STARS 
IN MARTIN MCDONAGH'S FIRST FEATURE 
FILM AND HARRISON BIRTWISTLE GIVES 
VOICE TO THE MINOTAUR 
GOOD EVENING GORDON BROWN MAY BE 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD BUT 
THE TEN P. TAX REBELLION APPEARS TO 
HAVE STARTED HERE WITHOUT HIM 
TONIGHT IN BOSTON THE PRIME 
MINISTER WAS CALLING FOR A NEW 
WORLD ORDER A NEW DAWN IN 
COLLABORATION BUT THE WORD 
COLLABORATION MAY BE STICKING IN 
HIS THROAT AT HOME MINISTERIAL 
AIDES HAVE ADDED THEIR VOICE TO M. P.'S 
CRITICAL OF THE TEN P. RATE 
WELL MR. 
BROWN WAS ANGRY TODAY HE THINKS 
THAT JOURNALISTS COVERING THIS TRIP 
HAVE EXAGGERATED THE EXTENT OF THE 
REBELLION BACK HOME ON THE QUESTION 
OF THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX 
RATE HE THINKS THAT COVERAGE OF 
THAT REBELLION IS RATHER 
OVERSHADOWING IMPORTANT THINGS THAT 
HE'S DOING AND SHAIG HERE IN THE 
UNITED STATES SAYING HERE IN THE 
UNITED STATES AND IN PARTICULAR 
THE IMPORTANT THINGS HE WAS SAYING 
ABOUT BIG GLOBAL ISSUES IN A SPEECH 
HE MADE HERE JUST A FEW HOURS AGO 
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT MASSACHUSETTS IS 
GORDON BROWN'S AMERICAN SPIRITUAL 
HOME THE STATE WHERE TRADITIONALLY 
HE TAKES HIS SUMMER HOLIDAYS AND 
WHERE MANY OF HIS AMERICAN FRIENDS 
LIVE MOST OF THEM LEFT LEANING 
DEMOCRATS AND IT WAS ONE OF MR. 
BROWN'S REGULAR HOLIDAY COMPANIONS 
SENATOR EDWARD KENNEDY WHO WELCOMED 
HIM TO THE LIBRARY IN BOSTON WHICH 
COMMEMORATES HIS BROTHER J. F. 
KENNEDY THE SENATOR WAS LAVISH IN 
HIS PRAISE THOUGH IN THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN 
TACTFUL TO REMIND MR. BROWN ON 
PLEDGES ON POVERTY THAT HE'S NOW 
UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO KEEP 
AT A 
TIME WHEN OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE 
CHILD POVERTY HAS LAGGED THE U. K. 
HAS AGGRESSIVELY IMPLEMENTED 
INNOVATIVE POLICIES THAT HAVE 
LIFTED OVER TWO MILLION CHILDREN 
OUT OF POVERTY AND HE IS COMMITTED 
TO ENDING POVERTY IN THE U. K. BY TWO THOUSAND TEN 
ECHOING NOT KENNEDY BUT ROOSEVELT 
GORDON BROWN'S THEME WAS A NEW 
GLOBAL DEAL SECURING JOBS 
EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE 
WORLDWIDE THROUGH MORE 
INTERNATIONAL CO OPERATION AND FREE 
TRADE 
AND THE BENEFITS WILL FLOW TRADE MOST EFFECTIVELY AND WIDELY 
INSTEAD OF ERECTING NATIONAL 
BARRIERS WE CO OPERATE ACROSS 
FRONTIERS TO MAXIMISE THE 
OPPORTUNITIES BUT TO DO THIS WE 
HAVE NO CHOICE NOW AND THIS IS MY 
MAIN POINT BUT TO CONSIDER AND 
AGREE NEW GLOBAL RULES AND CREATE 
GLOBAL INSTITUTIONS THAT BENEFIT 
NOT JUST SOME BUT ALL OF THE 
PEOPLE AFFECTED BY CHANGE WITH WITH THREE NEW PROAMERICAN LEADERS 
ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN EUROPE 
MERKEL SARKOZY AND SILVIO 
BERLUSCONI IRONICALLY ALL 
CONSERVATIVES MR. BROWN WANTS THE 
NEXT AMERICAN PRESIDENT TO SEIZE 
THE MOMENT 
AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS 
AND WILL BE IN DESPENCEABLE AND 
NOW IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AN 
HISTORIC EFFORT TO CO OPERATION A 
NEW DAWN TO CLAB RATIVE ACTION 
CLOB RATIVE ACTION BETWEEN AMERICA 
A NEW EFFORT WHICH I 
BELIEVE ALL EUROPEAN LEADERS WILL 
WORK WITH AMERICA TO FORGE THE 
STRONGEST TRANSATLANTIC LINKS THE THE PRIME MINISTER RAISED TODAY'S 
THOUGHTS WHEN HE MET ALL THREE 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES YESTERDAY 
AND HE WAS PLEASED WITH THEIR 
RESPONSE TO HIS SPECIFIC PLANS 
THIS IS THE MOMENT TO BRING IN 
CHINA INDIA SOUTH AFRICA BRAZIL 
THE OTHER EMERGING COUNTRIES TO THE 
HEART OF THIS DEBATE ABOUT A GLOBAL 
SOCIETY OFFERING THEM GREATER 
ROLE WITHIN THE G. EIGHT TO OFFER THEM 
MORE SAY IN THE IF M. AND WORLD BANK 
TO REFORM THE SECURITY COUNCIL OF 
THE UNITED NATIONS 
NOT PROPOSALS 
FOR WHICH GEORGE BUSH HAS EVER 
EXPRESSED MUCH ENTHUSIASM GORDON 
BROWN TELLING AMERICA AND THE REST 
OF THE WORLD NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO 
BE INWARD LOOKING AND NOT THE TIME 
TO ADOPT PROTECTIONIST MEASURES ON 
THE CONTRARY WITH LEADERS IN 
EUROPE AND A NEW PRESIDENT IN THE 
UNITED STATES IT'S A TIME FOR 
GREATER CO OPERATION AROUND THE 
WORLD MR. BROWN'S PROPOSED WORLD 
WOULD MARK A SIGNIFICANT BREAK WITH 
THE BUSH ERA 
IT IS THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN UNILATERALISM AND ULT 
LATERALISM THIS IS AN 
ADMINISTRATION THAT IS GOING IT 
ALONE MY WAY FOR THE HIGHWAY IT 
HASN'T BEEN 
SHORT MEDIUM OR 
LONG TERM INTERESTS AND I THINK 
GORDON BROWN SPELLED OUT A 
DIFFERENT APPROACH WHICH I THINK 
HAS MUCH MORE MEANING IN TERMS OF 
TODAY'S CHALLENGE 
MR. BROWN LEFT 
BOSTON TO RETURN TO HIS DOMESTIC 
PROBLEMS BACK HOME BUT HE'S 
DETERMINED TO PURSUE HIS GLOBAL 
VISION IN THE MONTHS AHEAD NOT 
LEAST AT THIS SUMMER'S G. EIGHT SUBMIT 
IN JAPAN WELL A LITTLE EARLIER I 
SPOKE TO RICHARD HAAS THE PRESIDENT 
ON U. S. COUNCIL FOR FOREIGN RELATIONS 
AND PREVIOUSLY WORKED FOR THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT FOR BOTH BUSH 
ADMINISTRATIONS I ASKED IF HE SAW 
GORDON BROWN'S SPEECHES AS A 
REJECTION OF THE POLICIES BEFORE 
THERE'S AN ARGUMENT SINCE THE END 
OF THE COLD WAR UNITED STATES 
BRITAIN AND ESSENTIALLY EVERYBODY 
ELSE HAS NOT MET THE CHALLENGE OF 
BUILDING GLOBAL INSTITUTIONS TO 
DEAL WITH THE GLOBAL CHALLENGES OF 
THIS ERA CLEARLY WHAT YOU ARE 
HEARING IS CALL FOR A 
RECOMMITMENT OR A WHOLE NEW SET OF 
COMMITMENTS YOU GO BACK TWENTY YEARS 
AND SOME OTHERS COULD GO BACK EIGHT 
SAYING HE TALKS ABOUT THE ERA OF 
CO OPERATION SPELLING OUT AMERICA 
HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO CO OPERATE 
PROPERLY WITH THE WORLD FOR THE 
PAST FOUR YEARS 
IT IS TRUE OVER THE LAST SEVEN 
YEARS THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING OF AN 
ALLERGY TOWARDS CERTAIN 
INTERNATIONAL CO OPERATION 
OBVIOUSLY IN THE AREA OF SAY 
CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE OTHER HAND 
TO GIVE IT ITS DUE THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN CO 
OPERATING ON TRADING 
MANY COMPARE 
WITH THE THE SPEECH TODAY WITH 
THAT TONY BLAIR GAVE IN CHICAGO 
WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT LIBERAL 
INTERVENTION THAT WAS OPTIMISTICLY 
RECEIVED AT THE TIME BUT THINGS 
HAVEN'T GONE ACCORDING TO PLAN 
LIBERAL INTERVENTION HASN'T WORKED 
YOU'RE RIGHT IT HASN'T WORKED FOR 
TWO REASONS ONE IS NO CONSENSUS 
AMONG THE MAJOR POWERS CHINA 
RUSSIA AND INDIA HAVE VERY LITTLE 
INTEREST IN THAT THEY FEAR IT WILL 
CONSTITUTE A COMPROMISE ON 
SOVEREIGNTY AND ONE DAY BE USED 
AGAINST THEM WHILE A LOT OF THE 
WORLD IS UNHAPPY ABOUT WHAT IS 
GOING ON IN SUDAN AND RWANDA 
PEOPLE ARE NOT PREPARED TO DO MUCH 
ABOUT IT 
HE TALKS ABOUT REFORM 
THE NEED TO REORDER ORGANISATIONS 
THAT ARE BY THEIR ESSENCE MEANT TO 
BE DEMOCRATIC THEY ARE NOT MEANT 
TO COME UP WITH SPEEDY ANSWERS AS 
WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED OVER ZIMBABWE 
EARLIER IN THE WEEK ISN'T THAT A 
CONFIRMATION IT DOESN'T WORK ONE ONE OF THE THINGS I WISH THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAD EMPHASISED A LITTLE 
BIT MORE IS THE NEED TO DEVICE NEW 
INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT UNIVERSAL 
IF WE APPROACH EVERYTHING THAT WE 
HAVE GOT TO HAVE EVERYBODY ON BOARD 
WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE GLOBAL 
CONSENSUS BEFORE WE CAN ACT WE'LL 
END UP NOT DOING VERY MUCH YOU YOU HAVE WORKED WITH BOTH 
ADMINISTRATIONS AND WHAT YOU HAVE 
HEARD TODAY FROM OUR PRIME MINISTER 
BUSH ADMINISTRATIONS IS AN OUTREST 
MESSAGE HE HAS TO START AGAIN IRAQ 
HAS BEEN A BIG FAILING MANY OF THE 
POLICIES HAVE FAILED HE IS LOOKING 
TO THE NEXT CANDIDATE TO START 
AGAIN 
FOR SURE IT IS TOO LATE IN AGAIN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION NOW TO 
LAUNCH ANYTHING BIG IN THAT SENSE 
IT IS A LAME DUCK THE FACT THE 
PRIME MINISTER MET WITH THE THREE 
CANDIDATES IS SYMBOLIC HE'S 
CALLING FOR A NEW FOREIGN POLICY 
THAT EMPHASISES DIPLOMACY MORE AND 
MULTI LATERAL INSTITUTIONS MY 
HUNCH HE WILL GET IT NO MATTER THE 
NEXT WHO THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS 
THE UNITED STATES WILL FIND IT 
DIFFICULT TO USE MILITARY FORCE WE 
ARE BOGGED DOWN IN AFGHANISTAN AND 
IRAQ AND OUR ECONOMY PROBLEMS THE 
ONE THING WE HAVE IS DIPLOMACY THE THE WARM RECEPTION GORDON BROWN 
RECEIVED WILL BE A CONTRAST TO THE 
CHILLY WINDS OF A LABOUR REBELLION 
LET'S RETURN TO MICHAEL CRICKET NOW 
HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM IS THIS FOR 
GORDON BROWN 
WELL AFTER THE FARCE OF YESTERDAY 
WHERE WE SAW ANGELA SMITH THE P. P. S. 
THE MINISTERIAL AID TO YVETTE 
COOPER AND THE QUESTION WHETHER SHE 
WAS GOING TO RESIGN AND GORDON 
BROWN HAD TO TAKE TIME OFF FROM HIS 
ACTIVITIES TO TAKE A CALL FROM HER 
SAYING SHE WASN'T GOING TO RESIGN 
IT IS GETTING PRETTY SERIOUS TODAY 
WE HAVE HAD FIVE MORE MINISTERIAL 
AIDES MR. BROWN WOULD HAVE HEARD 
ABOUT WHO HAVE COME OUT AND SAID 
PUBLICLY EXPRESSED PUBLICLY THEIR 
DISQUIET ABOUT THE TAX ISSUE JEFF 
ENNIS DAVID JOHN ANDERSON AND 
STEPHEN POUND WHO AT BEST SAY THEY 
THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE 
MADE THEIR CASE BIT MORE CLEARLY 
THEY REFLECT A WIDER POOL OF LABOUR 
M. P.'S SEVENTY HAVE SIGNED COMMONS MOTIONS 
OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER EXPRESSING 
CONCERNS MANY MAINSTREAM M. P.'S WHO 
TRADITIONALLY ARE LOYAL 
THIS COULD 
HAVE HAPPENED A YEAR AGO WHY IS IT 
HAPPENING NOW 
IT COULD THIS WAS 
INTRODUCED BY GORDON BROWN IN HIS 
LAST BUDGET L. THINK THE REASON 
IT'S HAPPENING NOW IS THAT THE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS PARTLY THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS ON MAY ONE IN WHICH IT 
LOOKS LIKE MAY FIRST IN WHICH IT 
LOOKS LIKE MAIRB WILL LABOUR WILL 
GETTING A HAMMERING LABOUR MAY BE 
LOOKING AT THE SEATS AND TALKING 
AMONG THEMSELVES AMONG THE M. P.'S 
CONCERNED IS THE MEMBER FOR 
BRIGHTON DES TURNER 
I SHOULD BE 
VERY VERY SURPRISED IF A LOT OF US 
ARE VERY CONCERNED WHAT THE EFFECT 
OF THE TEN WITHDRAWAL OF THE TEN PER CENT 
RATE BAND IS TO DISADVANTAGE A 
WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE ON LOWER 
INCOMES WHO WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST 
TO HELP OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS 
AND THIS IS THIS IS GOING 
BACKWARDS 
MICHAEL THE UNEASE IS BACKWARDS CLEAR PRACTICALLY WHAT HAPPENS 
NEXT 
WE WERE EXPECTING THERE TO BE NEXT DEBATE ON THE ISSUE WHEN M. P.'S RETURN 
TO THE COMMONS ON MONDAY IT WILL 
TAKE PLACE THE FOLLOWING MONDAY 
MONDAY A WEEK IT COULD BE QUITE A 
SIZABLE LABOUR REBELLION THERE 
AROUND AN AMENDMENT THAT WILL BE 
PUT DOWN BY FRANK FIELD BUT OF 
COURSE THE INTERESTING THING 
MONDAY A WEEK IS THE WEEK OF THE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS AND MANY M. P.'S MAY 
FEEL IT'S NOT THE TIME TO BE 
DISLOYAL TO REBEL THAT YOU HAVE 
GOT TO SHOW UNITY IN ELECTION WEEK 
WITH THE ELECTIONS THREE DAYS AWAY 
SOME M. P.'S MAY FEEL THAT THE WEEK OF 
THE ELECTIONS IS THE TIME TO SAW 
SOLIDARITY WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS 
WHO FEEL HURT BY THIS ISSUE BUT I 
SUSPECT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT 
WHATEVER HAPPENS ON MONDAY A WEEK 
WON'T GO AWAY IT WILL BUBBLE ON 
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THERE WILL BE 
VOTES LATER ON WHERE WE COULD SEE 
A GREATER REBELLION AND A SERIOUS 
POSSIBILITY THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
COULD LOSE ON THE ISSUE UNLESS IT 
COMES WITH A PACKAGE TO HELP THOSE 
SUFFERING FROM THE MEASURE 
FINANCIALLY THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT 
WILL NOT BACK DOWN THAT THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. RATE WAS PART 
AFTER WIDER PACKAGE INVOLVING A 
REDUCTION OF THE BASIC RATE 
THEY ARGUE THOSE LESS WELL OFF WILL 
OF COURSE BE COMPENSATED BY TAX 
CREDITS 
THANK YOU CREDITS TONIGHT IT LOOKS AS IF IT'S THE END 
OF THE BEGINNING OF THE CREDIT 
CRISIS RBS THE U. K.'S SECOND BIGGEST 
BANK LOOKS SAID TO GO TO THE STOCK 
MARKET TO RAISE TWELVE BILLION WORTH 
OF CAPITAL IN THE LAST HOUR THE 
B. B. C. HAS LEARNED THAT THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND IS TO INJECT FIFTY BILLION 
INTO THE BANKING SYSTEM THE TWO 
MOVES ARE LINKED AN THE RESULT OF A 
WEEK OF POLITICAL PRESSURE 
IT'S NOT EVERY BANK THAT CAN PRINT 
ITS OWN MONEY THE ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND IS ONE OF THE FEW THAT CAN 
BUT TODAY IT MIGHT BE ON THE POINT 
OF ASKING ITS OWN SHAREHOLDERS FOR 
MONEY QUITE A LOT OF IT JUST TO 
STAY WITHIN THE RULES WELCOME TO 
THE LATEST INSTALLMENT OF THE 
BANKING CRISIS 
RBS IS NOT IN TROUBLE THERE'S NO 
NEED FOR SAVERS TO BE QUEUING UP 
OUTSIDE BUT IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO 
OWN SHARES IN THE BANK WHO WILL NOW 
HAVE TO FIND EXTRA MONEY HERE'S 
WHY INTERNATIONAL BANKING RULES 
SAY THAT BANKS HAVE TO BALANCE THE 
RISK THEY TAKE WHEN LENDING AGAINST 
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CAPITAL AS 
REPRESENTED BY THE VALUE OF THEIR 
SHARES IT'S NOT MUCH JUST FOUR PER CENT BUT 
RBS HAS THE LOWEST FIGURE OF ANY U. K. 
BANK AT FOUR PER CENT INDEED IT MAY BE THE 
LOWEST IN EUROPE THE NEXT LOWEST 
IS BARCLAYS AT FIFTY FOUR PER CENT AND HBOS AT 
FIVE POINT SEVEN PER CENT JUST TO MATCH THEM RBS WOULD 
HAVE TO GET SHAREHOLDERS TO FORK 
OUT ANOTHER EIGHT BILLION THE BIGGEST 
CASH CALL EVER MADE IN U. K. FINANCIAL 
HISTORY AND IF RBS HAS TO WRITE 
OFF MORE DEBT NEXT WEEK WHICH 
LOOKS LIKELY THAT COULD RISE TO 
TWELVE BILLION SO HOW DID IT GET 
ITSELF INTO THIS MESS 
ROYAL BANK 
OF SCOTLAND HASN'T HAD LARGE LOSSS 
TO DATE THEY HAVEN'T ANNOUNCED 
THAT BUT ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND'S 
CAPITAL POSITION HAS BEEN WEAKENED 
BECAUSE IT ENTERED INTO A VERY 
AGGRESSIVE LARGE ACQUISITION AFTER 
THE CREDIT CRISIS STARTED THAT 
LEFT IT WITH A MUCH WEAKENED 
CAPITAL POSITION 
SO FRED GOODWIN 
THE BOSS OF RBS BUILT THE BANK 
THROUGH A SERIES OF TAKEOVERS HE 
BOUGHT NATWEST IN TWO THOUSAND A TEN PER CENT STAKE 
IN BANK OF CHINA IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND LAST 
YEAR A. B. N. AMRO THROUGH IT ALL SIR 
FRED MAINTAINED THAT SUCCESSFUL 
BANKING INVOLVED KEEPING THE LOWEST 
POSSIBLE CAPITAL ADD KAES HE WAS 
DUBBED THE PREEMINENT BANKER OF HIS 
GENERATION 
AS R. AS RBS IS GENERATION CONCERNED THEY'VE DONE OR WILL HAVE 
DONE TWO OF THE THREE THINGS THAT 
THEY NEED TO DO FIRST IS RAISE 
CAPITAL SECOND IS TO COME CLEAN 
ABOUT THE LOSS THAT'S THEY'RE 
SITTING ON THE THIRD THING THAT 
THEY'LL NEED TO DO IS SERIOUSLY 
REFORM THEIR BOARD WHAT THAT MEANS 
IN OUR VIEW IS EITHER THEIR CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE FRED GOODWIN'S GOING TO 
HAVE TO GO OR THE CHAIRMAN'S GOING 
TO HAVE TO GO OR THEY'LL HAVE TO 
HAVE A SERIOUS STRENGTHENING OF THE 
NON EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
SO WHAT 
DOT SHAREHOLDERS THINK THIS MAN 
RUNS AN INVESTMENT FUND THAT OWNS 
ONE MILLION WORTH OF RBS SHARES 
SOON HE'LL BE ASKED TO BUY SOME 
MORE 
BASICALLY WE NEED TO SEE THE MORE TERMS AND THE REASON FOR RAISING 
THE MONEY ETC L. THINK THEN WE'LL 
HAVE TO GIVE IT OUR CONSIDERED 
ATTENTION AT THAT STAGE WE CAN 
ONLY REALLY MAKE UP OUR MIND WHEN 
WE SEE WHAT THE COMPANY ACTUALLY 
HAS TO SAY 
PRESUMABLY TO FIND OUT 
WHAT'S THERE IN THE CUPBOARD WHAT 
CAUSED THIS 
PRECISELY L. L. THINK 
QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED WHY SIR 
FRED GOODWIN HAS DONE AT THIS 
MOMENT WHAT APPEARS TO BE A BIG U. 
TURN 
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A TURN WHOLE NEW FAILS IN THE BANKING 
CRISIS BECAUSE EARLIER THIS WEEK 
SIR FRED WAS ONE OF THOSE BANKERS 
WHO WENT TO GORDON BROWN AND ASKED 
HIM TO PRINT MONEY AND GIVE IT TO 
THEM AND IN RETURN THEY WOULD GIVE 
HIM A WHOLE BUNCH OF MORTGAGES THEY 
WERE ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF GORDON 
BROWN IS SAID TO HAVE TOLD THEM IF 
YOU WANT THAT TO HAPPEN YOUR 
SHAREHOLDERS MUST BEGIN TO FEEL THE 
PAIN THE B. B. C. HAS LEARNED TONIGHT 
THAT GORDON BROWN WILL PRINT MONEY 
FIFTY BILLION OF IT IN A MAJOR 
CHANGE OF POLICY THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND WILL RELEASE SPECIAL 
GOVERNMENT BONDS AND SWAP THEM FOR 
THE MORTGAGE ASSETS THAT SHOULD BE 
ENOUGH BUT IT'S A SIGNAL WE WILL 
PROBABLY SEE MORE BANKS DOING WHAT 
RBS HAS DONE RBS IS NOT THE ONLY 
BRITISH BANK IN OUR VIEW WHICH IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO DO THIS TOP OF 
THE LIST AMONG THE OTHER BIG 
BRITISH BANKS ARE BARCLAYS AND 
NOW KNOWN AS HBOS THEY 
WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE FORCED TO 
FOLLOW SUIT 
MOST OF THE LARGE U. K. 
BANKS HAVE SIMILAR SHAREHOLDING 
BASES PARTICULARLY AMONG THE 
PENSION FUNDS INSURANCE COMPANIES 
IN THE U. K. SO THE SAME GROUP OF 
INVESTORS ARE GOING TO BE ASKED TO 
COME TO THE TILL AND THROW MONEY IN 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO WE MIGHT 
EVEN SEE A STAMPEDE AS OTHER BANKS 
REALISE THEY MIGHT WANT TO GET 
THERE FIRST 
SO BANK BOSSES ISSUE A 
RECORD CALL FOR CASH AND DOWNING 
STREET AGREES A FIFTY BILLION 
INJECTION INTO THE SYSTEM WIDELY 
EXPECTED FOR THE PAST FIVE DAYS 
UNTHINKABLE JUST A FEW WEEKS 
EARLIER EARLIER PAUL IS WITH ME NOW THAT DETAIL 
STILL COMING IN WHAT MORE HAVE YOU 
LEARNED 
THIS IS BIG NEWS IT'S THE LEARNED BIGGEST INTERVENTION EVER BY THE U. K. 
CENTRAL BANK IT'S NEW NEWS I'M 
JUST GOING TO RECAP IT IT'S FIFTY 
BILLION THAT'S GOING TO BE 
INJECTED INTO THE BANKING SYSTEM AS 
EARLY AS THE END OF NEXT WEEK IT 
WILL BE DONE BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
ISSUING GOVERNMENT BONDS THEY WILL 
SWAP THEM FOR THE MORTGAGE ASSETS 
THAT THE BANKS ARE FINDING SO 
DIFFICULT TO GET RID OF THE SECURE 
TIESED ASSETS THAT THEY USED TO 
SELL ONTO EACH OTHER AND NOW THEY 
CAN'T THE IDEA IS TO BRING 
LIQUIDITY INTO THE MORTGAGE MARKET 
THERE WILL BE ONE YEAR BONDS OR 
JUST BELOW ONE YEAR THE IMPORTANCE 
OF THAT BECOMES CLEAR IN A MINUTE 
THE MORTGAGE LENDERS WANT CERTAINTY 
OVER ABOUT THREE TO FOUR YEARS 
ANYBODY WITH A THREE YEAR TRACKER 
KNOWS WHY THEY SET THE RATE OR A 
FIXED RATE MORTGAGE THEY'VE BEEN 
ASKING FOR TWO TO THREE TO FOUR 
YEAR BONDS TO BE ISSUED THEY'RE 
ONLY GETTING ONE YEAR CO 
INCIDENTALLY IT TURNS OUT THAT ANY 
BOND WHICH IS JUST A ONE YEAR BOND 
DOES NOT APPEAR ON THE GOVERNMENT'S 
FINANCES ON THE BOOKS THEREFORE 
IT DOESN'T CONTRIBUTE TO GOVERNMENT 
BORROWING GOVERNMENT BORROWING AT 
THE MOMENT IS FINELY BALANCED AND 
THE SUBJECT OF POLITICAL 
CONTROVERSY THE REACTION TO THIS 
MOVE IS JUST COMING IN L. HAVE ONE 
FROM VINCE CABLE THE LIB DEM 
TREASURY SPOKESMAN HE SAYS IT'S 
SCANDALOUS IT'S CLEARLY DESIGNED 
TO BAIL OUT THE BIG BANKS AT THE 
EXPENSE OF SMALLER BUILDING 
SOCIETIES AND HE INSISTS IT MUST BE 
MADE CLEAR THAT ANY LOSSES AND 
RISKS FALL ON THE BANKS THEMSELVES 
AND NOT THE TAX PAYER WHAT THIS 
IS IS A SWAP OF AN I. O. U. OF FIFTY 
BILLION SIGNED BY MILLIONS OF 
ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME 
WITH ALL THE RISKS THAT INVOLVES 
AND SWAPING THAT FOR AN I. O. U. FROM 
GORDON BROWN IT IS IN EQUITY AND 
IT HAS TO BE MANAGED CAREFULLY 
POLITICALLY 
I FEEL A BIT ODD POLITICALLY ASKING THIS BUT IS FIFTY BILLION 
ENOUGH 
FIFTY BILLION LET'S PUT IT ENOUGH INTO CONTEXT LAST YEAR NEW 
MORTGAGE LENDING WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TEN 
BILLION HALF OF THAT COMES FROM 
MONEY PEOPLE DEPOSIT IN THE BANKS 
THE OTHER COMES FROM THIS METHOD OF 
PAR SELLING IT UP AND SELLING IT 
ROUND THE BANKING SYSTEM IT'S 
ENOUGH TO COVER ABOUT ONE YEAR BUT 
OF COURSE WHAT WE DON'T KNOW MANY 
OF THE DETAILS WE KNOW THERE WILL 
BE A TUG OF WAR OVER THE CONDITIONS 
THE MORE OWNOROUS THEY ARE ON THE 
BANKS THE LESS IT SOLVES THE 
PROBLEMS THE LESS OWNOROUS THE 
MORE RISK FOR THE TAX PAYER THANKS THANKS VERY MUCH ALSO JOINING ME HERE IS 
JOHN MCFALL THE CHAIR OF THE 
TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE THANKS 
FOR COMING IN HOW LONG HAVE YOU 
KNOWN ABOUT THIS PLAN 
I'VE KNOWN 
ABOUT IT SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE THE 
PAST WEEK OR TWO THE GOVERNOR OF 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND CAME TO THE 
TREASURY SLOCT COMMITTEE OVER A 
MONTH AGO SELECT COMMITTEE AND HE 
ALOUDED TO THE SITUATION IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT IS NECESSARY 
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE THIS WHAT 
THIS WILL MEAN IS THAT THE WHOLE 
MORTGAGE MARKET AND PERHAPS THE 
ECONOMY WILL FREEZE UP WE'LL SEE 
THE MORTGAGE MARKET STOP EVERYONE 
INVOLVED IN THIS HAS HAD TO SWALLOW 
SOME PRIDE FOR EXAMPLE RBS A 
MONTH OR TWO BACK SAYING THEIR 
CAPITAL WAS SUFFICIENT THEY'VE 
GONE BACK ON THAT IT'S NOT JUST A 
ONE WAY STREET SYSTEM IT'S A TWO 
WAY STREET PEOPLE HAVE TO TAKE THE 
PAIN THEIR SHAREHOLDERS ARE GOING 
TO TAKE SOME OF THE PAIN HERE THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND HAS CHANGED THE 
LIQUIDITY STANCE AND THE 
GOVERNMENT ARE STICKING THEIR NECK 
OUT BY TAKING POLITICAL RISK L. 
THINK IT'S WORTH IT 
WHAT ABOUT 
THAT OMINOUS PHRASE CREATIVE 
ACCOUNTING THIS IDEA THAT THE ONE 
YEAR BONDS ARE REALLY LETTING THE 
GOVERNMENT OFF THE HOOK IN TERMS OF 
HOW ACCOUNTABLE IT HAS TO SEEM IS 
THAT NOT A WORRY 
WE'RE IN THE 
BIGGEST HOLE WE'VE EVER BEEN IN 
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE YEAR 
BONDS OR THREE YEARS CAN YOU GO 
OVER YOU KEEP THEM GOING THE 
FINANCIAL MARKETS WILL BE HAPPY 
WITH THAT LET'S GET REAL AND TRY 
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM 
WHAT WOULD 
YOUR ANSWER BE TO VINCE CABLE WHO 
SAYS IT'S SCANDALOUS WHO SAYS THE 
BIG BANKS HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEM 
L. WOULD SAY TO VINCE THAT HE CAN'T 
JUST CRITICISE HE'S GOT TO COME UP 
WITH SOMETHING WHICH IS A SOLUTION 
HE HAS KERNEL OF A POINT WE 
DON'T JUST WANT TO SEE THE BIG 
BANKS BUT PAUL MAKES THE POINT 
ABOUT FIFTY BILLION I WOULDN'T BE 
SURPRISED NEXT WEEK IF IT WAS 
GREATER WHAT THE AIM IS TO GET 
LIQUIDITY INTO THAT MARKET GET THE 
MARKET FUNCTION IS SO FUNCTIONING 
SO THE BIG BANKS AND SMALL BUILDING 
SOCIETIES BENEFIT L. HAD A CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE FROM A SMALL BUILDING 
SOCIETY COMPLAINING ABOUT THE 
SPREAD BETWEEN THE RATE AT WHICH 
THE BANKS LEND TO ONE ANOTHER AND 
THE BASE RATE WE MUST FIX THAT AND 
ENSURE THAT THE SMALL BUILDING 
SOCIETIES ARE INVOLVED IN THAT LET LET ME TAKE YOU BACK TO THE RBS POINT 
THIS EVENING HOW MANY MORE OF 
THOSE BANKS DO YOU THINK WILL COME 
FORWARD NOW DO THEIR MUCH NEEDED 
SPRING CLEANING SEIOUS REFORM 
RAISE THAT CAPITAL AND GET RID OF 
THEIR CHIEF EXECUTIVE IF NEED BE I I WOULD CONGRATULATE ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND FOR BEING THE FIRST OUT OF 
THE TRAP TODAY L. DON'T THINK IT 
WILL BE THE LAST I'M LOOKING FOR 
OTHER BANKS TO FOLLOW THEIR LEAD TO 
SHOW THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO TAKE 
SOME OF THE PAIN HERE AS WELL SO 
THAT WE DON'T INFECT THE REAL 
ECONOMY OF THIS COUNTRY 
A QUICK 
COMMENT ON ONE OTHER STORY IS 
ALISTAIR DARLING LIKELY TO STEP 
DOWN ON THE TEN P. TAX RATE 
I DON'T 
THINK SO 
ANY CHANGE L. HAVEN'T 
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY INDICATION OF THAT AT ALL 
JOHN MCFALL THANKS VERY MUCH 
SHE EARNED THE NICKNAME VINEGAR LIL 
FOR HER WITHERING CRITICISM AND 
STEADFAST ADHERENCE TO CRITICISM 
TODAY POLITICIANS OF ALL HUES HAVE 
PAID TRIBUTE TO A FOREMIDABLE 
PARLIAMENTARIAN GWYNETH DUNWOODY 
I LONG AGO GAVE UP EXPECTING ANSWER 
FRZ GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS LIFE IS 
DIFFICULT PRIME MINISTER SOMEONE 
IN RAILTRACK MUST TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOMETHING 
SHE WAS A BATTLEAXE HER WORDS 
RATHER THAN BATMAN BUT ALL THE 
SAME THERE WAS A LITTLE OF THE 
CAPED CRUSADER ABOUT GWYNETH 
DUNWOODY TROUSER SUITED ANY WAY 
LIKE HER HUSBAND SHE WAS ELECTED 
TO PARLIAMENT IN THE LABOUR 
INTEREST IN THE SIXTIES THERE WAS A 
FLASH OF THE DUNWOODY STEEL IN ONE 
OF HER EARLY INTERVIEWS AS WELL AS 
FOREMIDABLE MILL INERY 
I THINK 
I'VE DONE THE GROUND WORK FIRST 
DELIVERING LEAFLETS AND WRITING UP 
AND MAKING TEA AND BUNS L. THINK 
YOU'VE GOT TO START THAT WAY BEFORE 
YOU CAN MOVE ON INTO THE OTHER 
REALMS REALMS I REMEMBER YOU WERE 
THROWN OUT 
I WAS NOT THROWN OUT 
SHE ONCE COMPLAINED THAT HUSBANDS 
DIDN'T GIVE THEIR WIVES FLOWERS 
OFTEN ENOUGH THE NEXT DAY FLORISTS 
QUEUED AT THE COMMONS WITH BOUQUETS 
FOR HER THERE WERE MORE TODAY SHE SHE WAS A SIGNPOST AND NOT A 
WEATHERCOCK THE SIGNPOST POINTS 
THE WAY AND SAYS THIS IS THE WAY 
YOU SHOULD GO YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
AGREE WITH IT IF YOU COME BACK IN 
TEN YEARS AND THE SIGNPOST IS STILL 
THERE I HAVE NO TIME FOR 
WEATHERCOCKS AND SHE WAS A SIGNPOST 
MRS. DUNWOODY WAS THE LONGEST 
SERVING WOMAN M. P. SHE WAS KNOWN FOR 
BITING THE LEGS OF MINISTERS WHAT WHAT WE DO THE SELECT COMMITTEE S. 
MATTERS IT MATTERS BECAUSE THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS MUST NEVER BECOME 
A GREAT MORASS OF PEOPLE DOING WHAT 
THEY ARE TOLD NOT BY THE ELECTORATE 
BUT BY THE EXECUTIVE 
SHE CHAIRED 
THE TRANSPORT SELECT COMMITTEE 
DESPITE EFFORTS BY NEW LABOUR 
GRANDEES TO KICK HER OFF IT I I THINK IT'S REALLY A BIT SAD 
THEY'VE GOT A VERY LARGE MAJORITY 
THEY'RE TOTALLY IN CONTROL THEIR 
OPPOSITION IS IN DISARRAY YET THEY 
CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE PEOPLE ASKING 
AWKWARD QUESTIONS TELLS YOU MORE 
ABOUT THEM 
I DESCRIBED HER AS THE 
LOVE CHILD OF LEONARD BRESHNEV AND 
EDITH SHARPLES SHE WAS 
EXTRAORDINARILY NICE TO ME I'LL 
MISS HER A MARVELLOUS VOICE TOO 
SHE WAS VERY UNPACKAGED THIS VOICE 
LIKE THE CREEK ON A COFFIN I 
DESCRIBED IT THERE IS NO EASY WAY 
OF DEALING WITH THIS 
LIFE IS 
DIFFICULT PRIME MINISTER YOU HAVE 
DIFFERENTIATED BETWEEN THE TWO 
THANK YOU FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT I I THOUGHT IT WAS WHAT YOU WERE PAID 
FOR FORGIVE ME
