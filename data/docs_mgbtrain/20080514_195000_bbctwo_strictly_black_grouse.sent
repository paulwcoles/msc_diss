IT'S FIRST LIGHT ON THE LONELY UPLANDS OF BRITAIN 
A CURIOUS DAWN CHORUS CALLS TOGETHER MALE BLACK GROUSE 
THESE BIRDS ARE ABOUT TO COMPETE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR LIVES 
A TRULY SPECTACULAR NATURAL DANCE OFF 
THE FELLS OF LANGDON BECK 
ARE THE STAGE FOR THIS FEATHERED FANDANGO 
SET IN THE WINDSWEPT PENNINE MOORS 
IT'S LIKE A LAND THAT TIME FORGOT 
IT'S A PATCHWORK OF SEDGES MEADOWS AND STREAMS 
WHERE IN SPRING YOU CAN HEAR EVERY STYLE OF SERENADE 
BY GUYS IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO WIN A GIRL 
SKYLARKS GO FOR A SHOWY HOVER WITH TRILLS 
LAPWINGS CHASE AND WHISTLE TO THEIR MATES 
ON THEIR FLIGHTS OF FANCY 
SNIPE MAKE A CURIOUS DRUMMING NOISE 
WHILE CURLEWS ATTRACT A MATE WITH A HAUNTING CRY 
BUT THE TRUE STARS OF THE SHOW IN UPPER TEESDALE ARE THE BLACK GROUSE 
DURING THE AFTERNOON THEY'RE JUST GOOD MATES FEEDING UP 
FOR THE FORTHCOMING CONTEST 
WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE AT DAWN 
IN THE HALF LIGHT THE GROUSE ARE TRANSFORMED 
INTO GLOSSY MOVERS AND SHAKERS 
ALL FLUFFED UP THEY THINK THEY'RE GOD'S GIFT 
BUT AS THEY WARM UP TEMPERS RISE 
FOR THESE BOYS IT'S ALL ABOUT THEIR SPOT ON THE DANCEFLOOR 
THEY JOSTLE FOR POSITION 
BUT THEN IT'S TIME TO DANCE FOR THE JUDGES 
THE DISCERNING BUT DRAB FEMALES 
THE HENS ARE LOOKING FOR A CLASS ACT 
A GLOSSY COSTUME 
THE BRIGHTEST RED HEADDRESS IS ALL COMBINED WITH A GREAT SHIMMY 
AS EACH JUDGE CHECKS THEM OUT THESE OVER EXCITED MALES CANNOT REST 
THEY CAN NEVER BE SU RE 
WHEN SHE MIGHT NOTICE THEM IN THIS HOTBED OF FEATHERED DANCE FEVER 
I SEE YOU BABY 
SHAKING THAT ASS 
SHAKING THAT ASS 
SHAKING THAT ASS 
I SEE YOU BABY 
SHAKING THAT ASS SHAKING THAT ASS 
BUT CLOSER INSPECTION DOESN'T ALWAYS IMPRESS 
ALL RIGHT DON'T TOUCH ME 
FEMALES GIVE MALES THE ONCE OVER 
IT'S THE ULTIMATE IN SPEED DATING 
WHEN SHE'S CHOSEN SHE HANGS AROUND IN THE HOPE OF RUFFLING HIS FEATHERS 
BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE NOTICED HER 
OR HIS OTHER ADMIRERS 
WHILE HE'S LOST SIGHT OF HIS PRIZE 
THE HENS SQUABBLE AMONGST THEMSELVES 
FINALLY HE CLAIMS HIS WINNINGS AND A STAKE IN THE NEXT GENERATION 
WHILE FOR OTHERS A DANCE FOR SURVIVAL GOES ON 
WITHIN AN HOUR THE PARTY'S OVER 
THE BOYS BURY THEIR DIFFERENCES AND LEAVE 
THE GROUSE HEN IS A LONE PARENT 
AND MUST FIND SOMEWHERE TO RAISE HER CHAMPION'S BROOD 
A NEW DAY BRINGS THREATENING SKIES AND COLD RAIN 
HIDDEN IN THE GRASS 
MUM MUST PROTECT HER DEVELOPING EGGS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS 
HER FLECKED FEATHERS DON'T HAVE THE GLITZ OF HER MATE 
BUT THEY DO MAKE HER ALMOST INVISIBLE 
AS THE SKIES CLEAR THE FIRST FAMILIES OF THE SEASON STEP OUT 
FEASTING ON INSECTS IN THE GRASS 
THIS FAST FOOD MAKES UPPER TEESDALE A GREAT PLACE TO RAISE KIDS 
THE BUGS THAT AVOID BEING EATEN VISIT THE DISTINCTIVE FLOWERS 
MANY LIKE THE BIRD'S EYE PRIMROSES 
AND SPRING GENTIANS ARE RELICS FROM THE LAST ICE AGE 
BLACK GROUSE HAVE ALSO FOUND REFUGE HERE 
AND NOW TEASDALE'S QUIRKIEST RESIDENTS ARE ON THE UP 
A NEW DAY AND THERE ARE NEW VOICES IN THE GRASS 
TINY CHICKS UTTER THEIR FIRST MINUTE CALLS 
MOTTLED LIKE THEIR MUM THEY MUST KEEP HIDDEN 
AND EAT FAST 
COME NEXT SPRING HER DAUGHTERS WILL BE KEEN JUDGES 
AND HER SONS WILL BE GLAMOUR BOYS 
AND WHO KNOWS IF THEY SHAKE A TAIL FEATHER LIKE THEIR DAD 
THEY COULD BE IN WITH A SHOUT 
WELL YOU CAN TELL BY THE WAY I USE MY WALK I'M A WOMAN'S MAN 
NO TIME TO TALK 
AND AH AH AH 
STAYING ALIVE STAYING ALIVE 
AH AH AH AH 
STAYING'
