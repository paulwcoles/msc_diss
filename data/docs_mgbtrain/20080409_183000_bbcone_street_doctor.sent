WHEN THE CLUB SECRETARY HAS A QUESTION 
PUT YOUR TONGUE UP H. M. M. 
TONIGHT ON STREET DOCTOR 
I HEARD THAT CLICK CLICKETY CLICK I DID HEAR IT THERE 
THERE'S SOME HOT STUFF 
I'LL WARM IT FOR YOU 
GO FOR IT GIRL 
A SHOCKING SYMPTOM 
CAN YOU JUST ROLL YOUR LEG UP O. K. OH MY WORD WOW 
AND A REAL EYE OPENER 
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WHICH WOULD HAPPEN IS YOU COULD BE BLIND YEAH 
MEET THE STREET DOCTORS 
FOUR G. P.'S ON A MISSION TO TACKLE THE HEALTH OF BRITAIN 
FIRST UP IS DOCTOR JONTY WHOSE PASSION IS PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE 
NEXT IS DOCTOR GEORGE WHO'S FASCINATED BY MATTERS OF THE HEART 
DOCTOR BARBARA IS OUR FEMALE G. P. WHO SPECIALISES IN WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
AND FINALLY DOCTOR AYAN WHOSE FOCUS IS MEN'S HEALTH 
THEY TRAVEL THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF BRITAIN 
SEARCHING FOR PATIENTS TO TREAT 
THEIR MISSION TO MAKE THE U. K.'S STREETS A HEALTHIER PLACE 
THIS WEEK THEIR TARGET 
SHEFFIELD 
NO APPOINTMENTS NO WAITING THE STREET DOCTORS ARE COMING TO YOU 
THE NUMBER OF DEATHS FROM CANCER IN SHEFFIELD IS HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE 
CHILDHOOD OBESITY IS ON THE INCREASE IN SHEFFIELD 
THE CURRENT GENERATION OF CHILDREN COULD LOSE UP TO FIFTEEN YEARS OFF THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY 
DUE TO AN UNHEALTHY DIET AND LACK OF EXERCISE 
AT ANY ONE TIME THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED PREGNANT WOMEN 
IN SHEFFIELD WHO ARE STILL SMOKING 
IT'S UP TO THE STREET DOCTORS TO TURN THIS CITY AROUND 
KEEP GOING KEEP GOING KEEP GOING KEEP GOING KEEP GOING 
KEEP GOING EXCELLENT 
THERE'S UNUSUAL LOCATIONS 
O. K. I'M STUCK NOW 
FRIENDLY LOCALS 
GEORGE I NEED A HAND 
GEORGE THEY WON'T GIVE ME MY SIGN BACK 
AND A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS 
I DON'T SLEEP I'M SWEATY BETTY ALL NIGHT 
AND IT UPSETS MY LOVE LIFE AND EVERYTHING 
IT'S EARLY MORNING AND AS THE TRADERS SET UP AT CASTLE MARKET 
DOCTOR GEORGE WASTES NO TIME STARTING HIS SOUTH YORKSHIRE SURGERY 
GOOD MORNING GUYS ANYBODY GOT ANY PROBLEMS 
YES I'VE GOT BAD KNEES 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THAT FOR ABOUT TWELVE MONTHS NOW 
ALL RIGHT 
IF YOU WANT TO COME ROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE STALL 
I'LL JUST PUT MY SIGN DOWN AND WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR KNEE 
CAN YOU PULL UP YOUR TROUSER LEG THAT'S GRAND 
FIRSTLY THE OBVIOUS THING IS IT'S NOT SWOLLEN 
WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THE PAIN 
THERE YOU'RE GETTING PAIN ON BOTH SIDES AND IT CLICKS AS WELL 
IT CLICKS AS WELL YEAH WHEN YOU GET CLICKY KNEES 
THAT'S OFTEN DUE TO LOOSE BODY DEBRIS THAT GETS INTO THE JOINT 
SO WE'LL FLEX IT 
THAT'S NOT TOO BAD 
STRAIGHTEN THE LEG NOW 
OH I HEARD THAT CLICK CLICKETY CLICK ABSOLUTELY 
WELL I'VE NO DOUBT ALAN THAT WHAT YOU'VE GOT 
IS WHAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE IN THE U. K. WHICH IS ARTHRITIS 
BEING A BUTCHER HAVE YOU GOT ANY LEGS OF MEAT 
WHERE I CAN HAVE A LOOK AT IT AND TRY AND EXPLAIN TO YOU 
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AH RIGHT 
OKEY DOKEY I'LL PUT A PAIR OF GLOVES ON 
NICE AND STERILE WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
THAT'LL DO THE TRICK WONDERFULLY 
SO THERE WE ARE YOU CAN SEE THE JOINT THERE 
AND THIS SMOOTH PART IN THE JOINT IS THE CARTILAGE 
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN YOU GET THAT BIT OLDER 
THAT CARTILAGE AT THE END OF THE BONE STARTS TO DISINTEGRATE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANTI INFLAMMATORY TABLETS 
AND THEY HELP IN THE SHORT TERM BUT NOBODY HAS A CURE FOR ARTHRITIS 
SO GO FOR THE NATURAL THINGS THINGS LIKE GLUCOSAMINE 
FISH OILS OMEGA THREE OMEGA SIX 
THE OTHER THING YOU CAN DO IS APPLY HEAT 
BECAUSE IF YOU APPLY HEAT YOU INCREASE THE BLOOD SUPPLY 
TO THE MUSCLES THAT SURROUND AND SO ON 
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PUT A HEAT PACK ON RIGHT 
WE'LL DO THAT SLIP THAT ON THERE THAT'S THE GUY 
PULL THIS UP OVER YOUR KNEE THAT IS GRAND 
O. K. 
THAT WILL HEAT UP OVER THE NEXT TWENTY MINUTES OR SO 
AND YOU SHOULD FEEL THE BENEFITS OF THAT 
SO IT'S BEEN GREAT SEEING YOU 
LONG MAY YOU KEEP SELLING BEEF HERE IN SHEFFIELD O. K. 
AND POWER TO YOUR ELBOW 
HOT STUFF BY DONNA SUMMER 
DOCTOR BARBARA STARTS HER DAY AT A SHEFFIELD FACTORY 
BRINGING THE SURGERY TO THE SHOP FLOOR 
HELLO THERE DO YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR 
I'M ALL RIGHT THANK YOU 
HOW ABOUT YOU DO YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR 
I'M O. K. THANKS DO YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR 
YES PLEASE I DO OH VERY GOOD 
HOW CAN I HELP YOU 
I WENT TO THE DOCTORS ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO 
AND HE SAID I'D GOT A VIRUS 
IT STARTED WITH A DRY THROAT AND THEN IT PROGRESSED TO A COUGH 
SINCE THEN I'VE COME BACK TO WORK 
AND I'VE GOT THIS PAIN IN MY SIDE O. K. 
DO YOU MIND IF I HAVE A LISTEN TO YOUR CHEST NO 
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PUT THIS COLD STETHOSCOPE ON YOUR CHEST 
I NEED HOT STUFF 
I'LL WARM IT FOR YOU GO FOR IT GIRL 
HOT STUFF 
TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN FOR ME AND OUT 
NOW SOMEHOW CAN YOU TAKE YOUR ARM OUT OF THIS SLEEVE 
SORRY TO STRIP YOU OFF HERE 
THAT'S GREAT BIG BREATH THROUGH YOUR MOUTH 
AND OUT 
GOOD WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU TAKE A DEEP BREATH 
A NOT A HEAVY PAIN BUT BUT YOU CAN FEEL IT YEAH 
I THINK YOU'VE GOT A TOUCH OF PLEURISY 
WHAT HAPPENS IS YOUR LUNGS ARE COVERED IN A MEMBRANE 
AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER MEMBRANE ON TOP OF THAT WHICH LINES THE RIBS 
AND BETWEEN THOSE TWO MEMBRANES IS SOME FLUID LIKE A LUBRICANT 
THEY CALL IT THE PLEURAL SPACE 
WHERE THE LUBRICANT IS AND IF THAT'S INFLAMED 
THEN YOU GET A COARSE SOUND WHEN YOU'RE BREATHING 
A BIT LIKE A LITTLE RUB 
PERHAPS WE CAN NIP IT IN THE BUD WITH ANTIBIOTICS 
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I HOPE YOU SOON FEEL BETTER 
COULD BE A FORTNIGHT OFF THIS NO THERE'S NO SICK NOTE INCLUDED 
SHEFFIELD F. C. IS FAMOUS FOR BEING THE WORLD'S OLDEST FOOTBALL CLUB 
BUT MEDICAL MATTERS DISTRACT DOCTOR JONTY FROM THE GAME 
WHEN THE CLUB SECRETARY HAS A QUESTION 
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU 
I'D LIKE A DOCTOR TO HAVE A LOOK AT MY LEFT LEG 
IT'S NEVER GIVEN ME ANY PROBLEMS RIGHT 
IT JUST LOOKS VERY UNSIGHTLY 
CAN YOU JUST ROLL YOUR LEG UP 
O. K. OH MY WORD 
THIS IS THE LEG I'VE HAD TWO DEEP VEIN THROMBOSES 
O. K. YOU'VE HAD BLOOD CLOTS IN THE VEINS DEEP DOWN INSIDE THIS CALF 
CAN I GET YOUR SHOES AND SOCKS OFF THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT 
I'M SORRY 
IT'S SWOLLEN YOU CAN SEE THAT NOW 
I JUST WANT TO CHECK THE PULSES IN BOTH FEET JUST TO SEE 
WHAT YOUR CIRCULATION'S LIKE 
ALTHOUGH THIS LOOKS PRETTY HORRIFIC 
YOUR FEET ARE ACTUALLY BOTH QUITE WARM 
YOU DO HAVE GOOD BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE FEET 
BUT BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD THESE TWO DEEP VEIN THROMBOSES 
IN THIS LEG THE BLOOD ISN'T GOING BACK AS WELL AS IT SHOULD BE 
AND YOU CAN SEE IF I PRESS IN HERE HOW I LEAVE MY FINGER MARKS 
THAT'S COS THERE'S FLUID UNDERNEATH THE SKIN 
WHEN YOU GET THIS DISCOLOURATION 
IT'S LIKE A FORM OF ECZEMA 
AND THE RISK IS THAT IF THE SKIN BREAKS 
IT COULD FORM ULCERS AND THOSE CAN BE VERY HARD TO HEAL UP 
SO THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO DO 
YOU NEED TO KEEP THE SKIN REALLY NICE AND MOIST 
SO THAT IT DOESN'T BREAK DOWN O. K. 
YOU CAN USE ANY KIND OF MOISTURISING CREAM OR AN EMOLLIENT FOR THAT 
AND YOU NEED TO WEAR TIGHTS 
STOCKINGS GIVE OVER I WOULDN'T DARE 
OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUR LADIES' TIGHTS 
THERE ARE THINGS CALLED COMPRESSION STOCKINGS O. K. 
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE AT HOME IN THE EVENING ELEVATE YOUR FEET 
THAT WILL DRAIN FLUID OUT OF YOUR LEGS ALL RIGHT O. K. 
GOOD REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU AND YOU 
WE'D BETTER CARRY ON WATCHING THE GAME NOW LOOK 
IF YOU SUFFER FROM SWOLLEN ANKLES DOCTOR JONTY RECOMMENDS 
AVOID PROLONGED STANDING AND RAISE YOUR FEET UP WHEN YOU REST 
WEAR SUPPORT STOCKINGS WHICH WILL HELP TO REDUCE THE SWELLING 
IF YOU'RE OVERWEIGHT LOSING THE POUNDS WILL DEFINITELY HELP 
AND IF SYMPTOMS OCCUR ON ONE SIDE ONLY OR PERSIST VISIT YOUR DOCTOR 
THE SHEFFIELD SURGERY IS WELL UNDER WAY 
WITH DOCTOR AYAN CHARMING THE LOCALS 
OH DEAR 
AND SHOPPING FOR HIS FIRST CASE IN THE CITY CENTRE 
HIYA THERE HOW ARE YOU DOING NOT TOO BAD THANKS 
YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR I'VE GOT A LUMP 
ON MY TONGUE AND I WAS WORRIED TO SEE WHAT IT WAS 
COULD YOU HAVE A LOOK OF COURSE WHEN DID YOU FIRST NOTICE IT 
IT WAS PROBABLY ABOUT MAYBE TWO MONTHS AGO O. K. 
AND IS IT SORE OR JUST THERE NO NOT REALLY I BRUSHED MY TEETH 
ONE MORNING AND NOTICED A LUMP ON THE SIDE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK SEE WHAT'S GOING ON 
IT'S JUST THE ONE LUMP IS IT 
THERE'S ONE AND THEN A SMALLER ONE FURTHER BACK 
O. K. LET'S HAVE A QUICK LOOK THEN POP YOUR TONGUE OUT FOR ME 
OH RIGHT YEAH I CAN SEE IT'S JUST ON THE RIGHT SIDE 
OF YOUR TONGUE THERE ISN'T IT H. M. M. 
WELL DONE THAT'S FINE 
LOOKING AT THAT LESION IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS 
THAT IS LIKELY TO BE BENIGN 
BUT THERE IS A SMALL POSSIBILITY THAT IT COULD BE A BIT MORE SERIOUS 
IT'S NOT A MOUTH ULCER BECAUSE IT'S NOT SORE AND IT'S NOT A CYST 
COS IT'S NOT FULL OF FLUID 
WE DON'T SEE LESIONS LIKE THIS AROUND THE TONGUE OFTEN 
IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO GO TO YOUR OWN DOCTOR 
AND GET REFERRED ON TO AN ORAL SURGEON 
IS THAT ALL RIGHT YEAH 
I'VE BEEN DRAGGING MY HEELS ABOUT GOING TO THE G. P. 
BUT NOW I THINK IT'S PROBABLY A REALLY GOOD IDEA 
SO THANKS FOR YOUR ADVICE GLAD I COULD HELP THANKS VERY MUCH 
AT A CABLE CAR RIDE IN THE LOCAL COUNTRYSIDE 
DOCTOR JONTY IS ON DUTY FOR THE SIGHTSEERS 
ANYTHING THE STREET DOCTOR CAN DO FOR YOU TODAY 
AND ALMOST GETS A BREAK BEFORE HIS NEXT CONSULTATION 
HELLO DOCTOR CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION OF COURSE YOU CAN YEAH 
BASICALLY I'M TWENTY TWO WEEKS PREGNANT 
AND FOR ABOUT THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS 
I'VE HAD A PAIN QUITE LOW DOWN 
MORE RECENTLY I'VE NOTICED A LUMP THAT'S NOW APPEARED 
BEFORE THAT IT WAS JUST LIKE A PAIN 
I PUT IT DOWN TO THE PRESSURE OF THE BABY PRESSING DOWN ON SOMETHING 
O. K. IS IT YOUR FIRST PREGNANCY IT'S MY SECOND YOUR SECOND O. K. 
DID YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS DURING YOUR LAST PREGNANCY AT ALL 
NO NO NOTHING AT ALL 
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING HEAVY LIFTING 
WITH WORK THERE IS LIFTING BUT SINCE I'VE BEEN PREGNANT 
THAT'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY ROLE LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE LUMP 
I'M JUST GOING TO MOVE THE CHAIRS AROUND A LITTLE BIT 
HERE WE GO THIS IS MY AD HOC CONSULTING COUCH HERE WE GO 
DO YOU WANT TO JUST SIT DOWN AND IF YOU LIE HERE 
HOW'S THAT THAT'S FINE SOLID ENOUGH UNDER YOU YEAH I THINK SO 
YOU THINK SO I'LL JUST GET SOMETHING OUT OF MY BAG 
DON'T YOU WORRY YOURSELF 
O. K. BABY BEEN MOVING AROUND ALL RIGHT TODAY YEAH YEAH 
SO I'M JUST GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF JELLY ON FIRST OF ALL 
THAT'S YOUR HEART 
THAT'S BABY'S HEART 
THE BABY'S ABSOLUTELY FINE O. K. 
SO NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW 
COULD I GET YOU TO STAND UP YEAH YEAH 
O. K. AND IF YOU LOOK AROUND THIS WAY CAN I GET YOU TO GIVE A COUGH 
AND AGAIN 
IT'S LIKE THERE WHERE YOU'RE PRESSING AND AGAIN 
O. K. 
ALL RIGHT LET ME COME AND SIT DOWN O. K. I THINK YOU MAY HAVE A HERNIA 
YOU DO HAVE A SWELLING AND WHEN YOU COUGH 
THERE'S A SLIGHT IMPULSE IN IT WHICH MAKES ME THINK ABOUT HERNIA 
IT COULD BE THAT IT'S BEEN THERE FOR SOME TIME 
THEY'RE SIMPLY AN INDICATION OF A SLIGHT WEAKNESS 
IN THE MUSCLE WALL OF THE TUMMY 
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF YOU HAVE WEAKNESS THERE 
IT SORT OF PUSHES SOME OF THE BOWEL OUT 
THROUGH THE WALL OF THE ABDOMEN BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE 
YOU NEED TO GO ALONG SEE YOUR G. P. POSSIBLY TALK TO YOUR MIDWIFE 
AND SEE YOUR OBSTETRICIAN 
TO GET SOME ADVICE AS TO WHETHER THERE'S ANYTHING THEY DO 
I DON'T THINK THEY WILL DURING THE PREGNANCY 
LOVELY IS THAT ALL RIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S GREAT IT'S PUT MY MIND AT REST 
THE DOCTORS ARE BUSY ON THEIR MISSION TO TAKE THE SURGERY 
TO THE STREETS THEY'RE DIAGNOSING 
CUTTING THAT NERVE CAN STOP THAT REACTION REASSURING 
THERE IS NOTHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH YOUR HEART 
AND INVESTIGATING 
ARE YOU READY O. K. SHARP SCRATCH 
THAT'S IT OH LOADS OF BLOOD LOVELY 
AND BACK AT THE MARKET DOCTOR GEORGE STOPS FOR COFFEE

THANK YOU I LOVED YOUR COFFEE THE PROBLEM IS IT'S GONE COLD 
I'LL MAKE YOU ANOTHER ONE 
IF YOU'RE APPROACHING THE MENOPAUSE DOCTOR GEORGE SUGGESTS 
TAKE REGULAR EXERCISE SUCH AS A BRISK WALK OR EVEN DANCING 
THIS WILL ALSO HELP STRENGTHEN THE BONES 
CUT DOWN ON CAFFEINE AND EAT MORE FOODS THAT CONTAIN SOYA 
REDUCE YOUR ALCOHOL INTAKE AND STOP SMOKING 
IF YOU NEED FURTHER ADVICE OR WANT TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF H. R. T. 
SEE YOUR G. P. 
ALWAYS KEEN TO JOIN IN A HEALTHY ACTIVITY 
DOCTOR BARBARA TAKES TO THE FLOOR BOLLYWOOD STYLE 
HIP HIP HAND AND TURN TURN TWO THREE FOUR 
WHERE SHE MEETS A LADY WHO WANTS TO TALK ABOUT A PERSONAL PROBLEM 
AND SHIMMY LOVEBIRDS GO BACK 
YOU WANT TO ASK ME SOME ADVICE 
BIT EMBARRASSING BUT I SUFFER FROM HAEMORRHOIDS RIGHT 
DO YOU KNOW I MUST SEE THREE OR FOUR PATIENTS A DAY WITH HAEMORRHOIDS 
EVERYBODY'S EMBARRASSED BUT IT'S ONE OF THE COMMONEST PROBLEM 
HAEMORRHOIDS THEY'RE VARICOSE VEINS IN THE BOTTOM 
OFTEN PEOPLE GET THEM AFTER THEY'VE HAD A CHILD 
OR IF THEY HAVE CONSTIPATION 
AND THE SORT OF STRAINING PUTS PRESSURE ON THE VEIN 
TO COME DOWN INTO THE BACK PASSAGE 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THEM 
I WOULD SAY ABOUT THREE YEARS HAVE YOU ON AND OFF 
THEY SEEM TO CLEAR UP FOR A WHILE BUT THEY KEEP REOCCURRING 
D'YOU GET CONSTIPATED I DO YEAH THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM REALLY 
SO YOU NEED TO LOOK AT YOUR DIET AND MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GET CONSTIPATED 
SOME PEOPLE ARE BETTER OFF WITH MORE ROUGHAGE IN THEIR DIET 
WE SAY FIVE PIECES OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLE EVERY DAY 
I'M A BIT SHY ON ME FRUIT OH ARE YOU 
I LIKE GRAPES AND BANANAS 
BUT THINGS LIKE APPLES AND ORANGES I DON'T TEND TO EAT MUCH OF 
TRY AND INCREASE YOUR ORANGES BECAUSE THE ORANGES DEFINITELY HELP 
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED SUPPOSITORIES 
NO WELL IF THAT'S YOUR BOTTOM 
YOU PUT THE POINTY END IN 
AND YOU WILL KNOW WHEN IT'S GONE IN BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU SHUDDER 
I KNOW IT'S IN 
THEN YOU CAN FEEL IT KIND OF SUCKED IN RIGHT 
BUT WHEN IT'S IN THERE IT'S WORKING ON THOSE VEINS 
THAT ARE INSIDE THE BACK PASSAGE YOU CAN BUY THEM OVER THE COUNTER 
I HOPE THAT HELPS IT DOES YEAH 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOVELY TO MEET YOU AND THANK YOU THANK YOU 
TAKING THEIR PRACTICE TO THE PAVEMENT 
HELLO HOW ARE YOU DOING 
DOCTOR JONTY AND DOCTOR GEORGE MEET A MUM WITH A PROBLEM WEIGHING ON HER MIND 
HI HELLO GUYS HOW ARE YOU DOING 
STREET DOCTORS HOW ARE THINGS ANY PROBLEMS 
ACTUALLY WE DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU 
I GET THIS BACK PAIN EVERY NOW AND AGAIN 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS RELATED TO DIET AND WEIGHT 
COULD I ASK YOU HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK YOU WEIGH 
AROUND FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN STONE AROUND FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN STONE 
GUYS COULD YOU JUST HOLD MY SIGN FOR ME A SECOND 
WE JUST NEED TO CHAT TO MUM 
SO WHAT WAS YOUR WEIGHT FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN STONE 
AND YOUR HEIGHT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN CENTIMETRES 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN CENTIMETRES 
EVEN GOING WITH IT BEING FIFTEEN STONE AT YOUR HEIGHT 
YOUR BODY MASS INDEX IS THIRTY FOUR WHICH IS HIGH 
PUTS YOU IN THIS TERRIBLE WORD HERE CAN YOU READ THAT 
I HATE IT OBESE CLASS RIGHT 
SO THIS IS YOUR YOUNGEST 
HOW OLD IS SHE SHE'S FOUR AND A HALF FOUR AND A HALF 
AND HOW MUCH DOES SHE WEIGH ABOUT TWENTY KILOS 
TWENTY KILOS THAT ACTUALLY IS ROUND ABOUT 
THE THREE STONE THAT YOU NEED TO LOSE 
IT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF CARRYING HER AROUND ON YOUR BACK 
ON YOUR BACK IT HAS BEEN GREAT MEETING YOU 
AND GREAT SEEING YOU AS WELL 
WISH YOU ALL THE BEST BYE BYE CAN I HAVE MY SIGN BACK 
SHEFFIELD IS ON THE EDGE OF THE PEAK DISTRICT 
AND HOME TO MANY KEEN CLIMBERS 
DOCTOR AYAN MAY NOT HAVE A HEAD FOR HEIGHTS 
O. K. I THINK I'M GOING TO COME DOWN NOW 
BUT HE SOON MEETS SIMON WITH A CONCERN CLOSER TO THE GROUND 
HIYA THERE HOW YOU DOING NICE TO SEE YOU 
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU I'VE GOT A BIT OF A DODGY FOOT REALLY 
RIGHT FOOT ON THE OUTSIDE 
AND IT'S BEEN LIKE IT FOR PROBABLY A WEEK OR TWO ALL RIGHT 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'VE GOT NUMB FEET AND IT HURTS IT'S LIKE THAT EVEN WHEN IT'S NOT COLD 
O. K. LET'S HAVE A LOOK SHALL WE I'LL JUST POP THIS DOWN 
WHEREABOUTS IS THE PAIN 
IT'S THAT BIT THERE THAT LUMP BASICALLY 
AND IT HURTS TO TOUCH YOU KNOW IT HURTS ALL THE TIME 
FOOT FEELS LIKE A BLOCK OF ICE IT'S FREEZING 
THERE'S A VERY WELL KNOWN COLLOQUIALISM FOR THIS 
AND IT'S CALLED A CHILBLAIN 
IT'S REALLY A SIGN OF DIMINISHED CIRCULATION IN THE FEET 
I THINK SOMETHING CALLED HEPARINOID GEL TWICE A DAY 
WOULD DEFINITELY SETTLE THIS DOWN 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE USE FOR INFLAMED BLOOD VESSELS 
IT'S BRILLIANT FOR CHILBLAINS 
DO YOU EVER GET ANYTHING LIKE THIS ON YOUR HANDS 
THEY GET REALLY REALLY COLD EVEN WHEN IT'S NOT THAT COLD DO THEY 
THERE'S ONE OTHER CONDITION THAT SPRINGS TO MIND 
IF YOU GET THIS IN YOUR HANDS AND FEET CALLED RAYNAUD'S PHENOMENON 
THAT RUNS IN FAMILIES DOES ANYONE ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY HAVE THIS 
MY DAD USED TO GET CHILBLAINS FROM HIS PAPER ROUND WHEN IT WAS REALLY COLD 
I SUPPOSE FORTY YEARS AGO IT WAS ALWAYS COLD OUT YEAH 
BACK IN THE DAY 
IN THAT CASE I DO THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE RAYNAUD'S PHENOMENON 
YOU MIGHT NEED TREATMENT FOR THAT A TABLET CALLED NIFEDIPINE 
IT EFFECTIVELY INCREASES BLOOD FLOW TO YOUR PERIPHERIES 
THAT DEFINITELY TAKES IT AWAY THANKS FOR TALKING TO ME 
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO GO CLIMBING IT'S SETTLED DOWN A BIT 
YES THAT'S YOUR TOUCH THE TOUCH OF A DOCTOR ABSOLUTELY 
DISCO TWO THOUSAND BY PULP 
OVER AT HILLFOOT STEEL DOCTOR GEORGE MEETS GARY 
A DIABETIC WHO IS IN NEED OF SOME OF URGENT MEDICAL ADVICE 
I GATHER YOU HAVE BEEN A DIABETIC FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS 
AND CONTROLLED BY INSULIN HOW ARE THINGS 
GENERALLY O. K. 
I AM WORRIED ABOUT MY EYES AT THE MOMENT RIGHT 
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL FOR THE EYE CHECK 
FOR ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS NOW EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
IS THERE ANY BLURRING OF YOUR VISION 
OR ANYTHING THAT'S WORRYING YOU ABOUT YOUR EYES 
BLURRING A LITTLE BIT LATE ON IN THE EVENING 
WHERE I'D PERHAPS PUT IT DOWN TO TIREDNESS 
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WANT IF YOU'RE AN INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETIC 
IS TO ENSURE THAT YOU GET CLOSE GLUCOSE CONTROL 
TO PREVENT ANY COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES 
AND THERE CAN BE COMPLICATIONS ONE OF THEM 
IS THE EYE SOMETHING CALLED RETINOPATHY 
WHERE SOMETIMES 
YOU CAN GET A LITTLE LEAKAGE OF BLOOD FROM A BLOOD VESSEL 
I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM BEFORE WITH THE BACK OF THE EYE YES 
THAT'S THE REASON WHY YOU VERY MUCH HAVE TO HAVE YOUR EYES CHECKED 
AT LEAST ONCE EVERY TWELVE MONTHS IF YOU DON'T GET YOUR EYES CHECKED 
YOU COULD FIND YOUR VISION DETERIORATES 
AND THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WHICH WOULD HAPPEN IS YOU COULD BE BLIND 
DUE TO GARY'S DIABETES DOCTOR GEORGE IS KEEN TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION 
I FEEL THAT YOU'VE GOT TO SEE AN OPTOMETRIST 
WE NEED TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THE BACK OF THE RETINA 
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU AGAIN AFTER THAT TEST HAS BEEN DONE 
POP YOUR TONGUE OUT FOR US 
SHEFFIELD IS KEEPING THE MEDICS ON THEIR TOES 
AH THERE WE GO NOT PREGNANT 
I TAKE IT THAT'S A RELIEF YES 
AND OUR PAVEMENT PHYSICIANS WILL NOT REST UNTIL THEY'VE PUT THIS CITY'S HEALTH BACK ON TRACK 
OVER AT THE MARKET THE RESULTS OF GILL'S BLOOD TESTS ARE BACK 
HI IT'S GILL ISN'T IT IT IS YES 
I'M JONTY I'M ONE OF THE STREET DOCTORS I WORK WITH DOCTOR GEORGE 
HE HAS SENT ME ALONG TO HAVE A CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT OUR RESULTS 
OH GOOD DOCTOR GEORGE DID SOME BLOOD TESTS TO SEE 
WHETHER YOU DEFINITELY ARE MENOPAUSAL 
I'VE GOT THE RESULTS OF THOSE HERE GOOD 
AND SURPRISE SURPRISE I AM AREN'T I 
YOU ARE EXACTLY 
THE HORMONE TESTS THAT WE LOOK AT O. K. 
ARE HORMONES THAT ARE PRODUCED IN THE BRAIN TO STIMULATE THE OVARIES 
WHEN THE OVARIES STOP WORKING WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MENOPAUSE 
THE LEVELS OF THESE HORMONES GO UP 
BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO PUSH THE OVARIES TO WORK 
SO THE LEVEL OF THIS ONE THAT WE CALL F. S. H. 
WE WOULD NORMALLY EXPECT TO BE NO HIGHER THAN TWENTY ALL RIGHT 
I CAN SEE AND YOURS IS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN 
THAT'S MY TEMPERATURE AT NIGHT IS IT YEAH ABSOLUTELY 
WHAT H. R. T. DOES IS IT REPLACES OESTROGEN O. K. 
PROBABLY WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS ON H. R. T. 
YOU'D STOP HAVING THE SWEATS 
HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME RISKS ATTACHED TO H. R. T. 
THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER STROKE AND CANCER OF THE WOMB 
SO WHAT WE SUGGEST TO PEOPLE NOW IS THAT THEY DON'T TAKE H. R. T. FOR LONGER THAN A COUPLE OF YEARS 
GO TO YOUR PRACTICE GET YOUR G. P. OR NURSE TO CHECK YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE 
I'M SURE THEY'D BE HAPPY TO PRESCRIBE H. R. T. 
BUT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME 
YOU UNDERSTAND THE RISKS THEREFORE 
IF IT'S A DECISION YOU WANT TO MAKE YOU'RE RIGHT TO MAKE IT THANK YOU 
THE STREET DOCTOR IS HERE TODAY 
IF ANYONE'S FEELING A BIT ILL SEE THE DOCTOR 
WITH A SHOUT OUT AT THE UNIVERSITY 
DOCTOR BARBARA SOON FINDS ANOTHER PATIENT IN NEED OF ADVICE 
HELLO I'M DOCTOR BARBARA I'M RUI 
RUI 
WHERE ARE YOU FROM RUI I AM FROM PORTUGAL PORTUGAL 
SO HOW CAN I HELP YOU I GOT BACK FROM SOUTH AMERICA A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO 
AND I'M WORRIED REGARDING S. T. D.S 
O. K. SO S. T. D.S SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES YEAH 
ARE YOU WORRIED BECAUSE YOU MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION YES 
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS 
OF A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION 
NO I DON'T HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS ONE CONDOM JUST BROKE RIGHT 
THAT'S A VERY COMMON PROBLEM 
I GET LOTS OF PATIENTS WITH THAT PROBLEM 
AND OF COURSE I THINK IT'S VERY VERY WISE 
TO GET CHECKED UP 
THERE ARE SPECIAL CLINICS CALLED 
GUM CLINICS GENITO URINARY MEDICINE CLINICS 
LIKE A ONE STOP CLINIC WHERE YOU CAN GET EVERYTHING CHECKED 
IT'S NON JUDGMENTAL 
IT'S HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL 
AND IF YOU LIKE I CAN TAKE YOU ALONG THERE 
AND WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET YOU AN APPOINTMENT 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE GREAT 
DOCTOR JONTY IS AT THE FAMOUS GRIMETHORPE COLLIERY BAND 
WHERE HE MEETS A TUBA PLAYER WORRIED ABOUT REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY 
SEAN HOW CAN I HELP YOU 
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS RIGHT SHOULDER O. K. 
IT PROBABLY STARTED SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS AGO 
MAYBE I SIT WITH THAT SHOULDER MAYBE 
DOWN IN THE WRONG POSITION TOO OFTEN I DON'T KNOW 
O. K. IF YOU JUST WANT TO STAND UP FOR ME A SECOND 
THE FIRST THING I WANT YOU TO DO 
IS TAKE YOUR TOP OFF AND TURN AROUND SO I CAN JUST EXAMINE YOUR SHOULDER 
PUT YOUR HEAD FORWARD FOR ME 
YEAH THAT'S IT THAT'S WHERE IT IS THERE JUST IN THERE YEAH 
O. K. JUST HAVE A SIT DOWN FOR ME 
I THINK MOST OF THIS HAS GOT TO DO 
WITH THE POSTURE THAT YOU ADOPT WHEN YOU PLAY THE TUBA 
THAT PUTS TENSION ON THE MUSCLES AROUND THE BACK OF THE NECK 
TRADITIONALLY AS A G. P. I WOULD SAY TAKES SOME IBUPROFEN 
AND SOME PHYSIOTHERAPY 
THE OTHER OPTION IS SOMETHING LIKE SOME ACUPUNCTURE O. K. 
I'VE JUST STARTED LEARNING SOME ACUPUNCTURE GOOD 
IS THAT GOOD THAT YOU'VE JUST STARTED TO LEARN IT 
I'M IN MY EARLY STAGES 
ALTHOUGH I'M A BEGINNER I'M HAPPY TO DO ACUPUNCTURE ON YOUR SHOULDER 
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN 
YEAH COOL NO PROBLEM WITH THAT AT ALL 
O. K. WELL WE'LL GIVE IT A GO 
I'VE GOT SOME ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLES WITH ME ALL RIGHT 
I'LL USE A COUPLE OF ACUPUNCTURE POINTS USED IN CHINESE MEDICINE 
I'M ALSO GOING TO TRY AND FIND SOME OF THOSE TENDER PLACES 
TO SEE IF WE CAN RELEASE SOME OF THE PAIN IN THE MUSCLE THERE 
O. K. HOW'S THAT FINE I FELT NOTHING AT ALL FROM THAT 
SO QUITE A LOT OF TENDERNESS IN HERE YEP 
O. K. 
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS JUST 
PUT THE POINT OF THE NEEDLE JUST INTO THE MUSCLE 
WHERE IT'S PARTICULARLY TENDER 
ALL RIGHT SO 
I'M GOING TO LEAVE THOSE NEEDLES THERE FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES OR SO 
SO ARE YOU ABLE TO SIT AND RELAX 
I CAN SIT AND RELAX FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIKE ALL RIGHT I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE 
DREAMING OF YOU BY THE CORAL 
AS THE DOCTORS' DAY DRAWS TO AN END IN SHEFFIELD 
GARY WHO HAS DIABETES HAS BEEN FOR A LONG OVERDUE EYE TEST 
AND DOCTOR GEORGE HAS ARRANGED TO MEET AND TO DISCUSS THE RESULTS 
GARY IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN AND OF COURSE 
WE NOW HAVE THE LASER PICTURES OF THE BACK OF YOUR EYE 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE ACTUAL BLEEDS WHICH YOU'VE HAD IN THE PAST 
WHICH REQUIRED THE LASER THERAPY HAVE STOOD UP 
IT'S BEEN A GOOD JOB YOU'VE HAD NO FURTHER BLEEDS 
YOUR VISION IS DOWN SLIGHTLY IN THAT LEFT EYE 
BUT WHAT YOU GARY MUST NOT DO 
IS GO A FURTHER EIGHTEEN MONTHS WITHOUT GETTING THIS DONE 
IT'S A BIG RELIEF I'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH MY EYES 
I WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT 
FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS I HADN'T SEEN ANYBODY 
IT WAS ACTUALLY WORTH COMING TO SEE YOU 
THAT'S GREAT COS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS YOUR VISION 
AND YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO YOUR BIT TO LOOK AFTER IT 
BY MAKING SURE IT'S REGULARLY CHECKED 
GREAT SEEING YOU 
AND I'M DELIGHTED TO GIVE YOU THAT NEWS O. K. THANK YOU MY PLEASURE 
GARY GETS THE ALL CLEAR 
AND DOCTOR JONTY FINDS OUT IF HE'S EASED SEAN'S PAIN 
DOES THAT FEEL ANY BETTER WEIRDLY YES I THINK I AM 
I CAN MOVE MY HEAD A LOT EASIER UP AND DOWN 
SOME PEOPLE DO GET AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT FROM ACUPUNCTURE 
AND IT REALLY DOES HELP 
BUT IT'S OFTEN IMPORTANT TO HAVE MAYBE FIVE OR SIX TREATMENTS 
I'D SUGGEST TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE WHO OFFERS ACUPUNCTURE LOCALLY 
OR A PHYSIO APPOINTMENT 
PHYSIOTHERAPISTS ARE EXCELLENT WITH MUSCLES 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME 
THE STREET DOCTORS' MISSION IS COMPLETE 
BUT WHAT ARE THEIR THOUGHTS ON THE DAY 
WHAT A GREAT DAY WE HAD IN SHEFFIELD I SAW THIS MAN 
WHO'S BEEN AN INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETIC FOR THIRTY YEARS 
THE PROBLEM WAS HE HADN'T HAD HIS EYES CHECKED FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
YOU AND I KNOW IF YOU'RE DIABETIC YOUR EYES ARE IMPORTANT 
PLEASE GET YOUR EYES CHECKED EVERY TWELVE MONTHS BY A DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPH 
I SAW A CHAP WHO WAS REALLY HAPPY TO TALK TO ME ABOUT SEXUAL HEALTH 
WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS SO IMPORTANT IN THE STUDENT POPULATION 
RIGHT I SAW A GUY CALLED STEFAN WHO HAD A LESION ON HIS TONGUE 
IT WASN'T SORE 
IT WASN'T AN ULCER I WAS WORRIED ABOUT IT 
I GOT HIM TO GO BACK TO HIS DOCTOR AND GET REFERRED ON 
SINCE THE STREET DOCTORS' VISIT TO SHEFFIELD 
RUI WAS HAPPY TO GET THE ALL CLEAR AT HIS SEXUAL HEALTH M. O. T. 
ALAN IS FIT AS A FIDDLE BACK AT WORK 
SEAN HAS KEPT UP WITH THE ACUPUNCTURE TREATMENTS 
AND REPORTS THAT HIS SHOULDER IS CURED
