GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO THE 
ARENA IN MANCHESTER IT IS THE 
SECOND DAY OF THE WORLD SHORT 
COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS AND WE WILL BE 
LOOKING BACK AT LAST NIGHT'S FINALS 
RING YOU UP TO DATE ON TODAY'S 
HEATS GENERALLY ADDRESSING THE 
ISSUES IN THE WORLD OF WATER 
ENTHUSIASTIC CROWDS FUNKY LIGHTING 
AND A SUPER FAST POOL WE HAD FIVE 
FINALS LAST NIGHT AND GREAT BRITAIN 
HAD A CONTENDER IN EVERY ONE WE 
WILL BE HEARING FROM MARK FOSTER 
THE OLD MAN OF BRITISH WOMEN AND HE 
IS ON COURSE FOR HIS FIFTH OLYMPICS 
WE WILL GET UNDER THE SKIN OF THE 
NEW SUITS WITH EIGHTEEN WORLD RECORDS SET 
THIS IS THE CHANGE IN BODY ARMOUR 
OF INTERNATIONAL SWIMMING 
DELIGHTED TO SAY ADRIAN MOORHOUSE 
AND SHARRON DAVIES HAVE JOINED ME 
WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING BACK ON 
THOSE THINGS ARE YOU ENJOYING IT 
SO FAR 
IT IS FANTASTIC ALL THE 
SCHOOL KIDS ARE HAVING A GREAT TIME 
SHOUTING 
IF WE HAD A MONITOR THE SHOUTING PICTURE OF THE SHOUTING IS VERY 
HIGH HIGH NOW LET'S LOOK AT THAT TWO HUNDRED M. 
FREESTYLE CHALLENGE FOR THE MEN 
DAVID CARRY HAD QUALIFIED SECOND 
FASTEST FOR THE FINAL THE FIRST FINAL AT MANCHESTER A 
RESPONSIBLE JOB FOR DAVID CARRY 
THE FIRST BRITON TO SWIM TWO 
MEDALISTS FROM LAST TIME IT IS GOING TO BE A VERY BIG RACE 
INDEED THE AUSTRALIANS ARE IN 
SEVEN AND EIGHT THEY DON'T LIKE 
BEING ON THE OUTSIDE THERE WAS THE 
FIRST ONE KIRK PARMA TWENTY ONE YEARS OF 
AGE AND THEY ARE VERY FAST THEY 
ARE INTRODUCING THE SWIMMERS THE 
SLOWEST TO FASTEST THIS IS THE 
SECOND AUSTRALIAN KENRICK MONK 
SECOND AT THE AUSTRALIAN TRIALS HE 
WILL BE IN BEIJING NOT ONLY IN THE 
INDIVIDUAL BUT ALSO FOR FOUR BY 
TWO HUNDRED M. RELAY I THINK IT WILL BE MORE OF A HEAD 
TO HEAD RACE NOT A PARTICULARLY 
FAST RACE IF IT IS THAT WILL SUIT 
DAVID CARRY DAVID CARRY IT 
IS ALMOST LIKE GLADIATORS GOING 
INTO THE RING HE IS GETTING A HUGE 
OVATION HE HAS NEVER SWUM AN 
INDIVIDUAL WORLD CLASS FINAL HE 
DID WELL AT THE COMMONWEALTH GAMES 
BUT WHAT CAN HE DO AGAINST THE 
ITALIAN 
THE ITALIAN HAS ALL THE ITALIAN EXPERIENCE WE KNOW THAT WE WERE 
SO EXCITED IN MELBOURNE AT THE 
COMMONWEALTH GAMES BUT THE ITALIAN 
IS THE ONE TO WATCH DAVID CARRY IS 
IN TOP FORM DAVID CARRY OBTAINED A LIFETIME 
BEST JUST TO QUALIFY FOR THIS FINAL 
A SHOCKING START TO THE ITALIAN 
AND THE AUSTRALIANS AT THE BOTTOM 
I AM NOT SURE THAT START WAS 
ABSOLUTELY STILL 
ITALIAN GOT A 
VERY VERY POOR START HE WILL HAVE 
TO WORK VERY HARD ISN'T THIS ALWAYS WHAT THE 
AUSTRALIANS DO IF THEY GET IN LANE 
SEVEN EIGHT OR ONE THEY TAKE THE 
RACE OUT 
AS WE MENTIONED BEFORE 
DAVID CARRY IS A GOOD FOUR HUNDRED M. SWIMMER 
THIS IS THE HALFWAY POINT THE 
AUSTRALIANS ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO 
HOLDING ON TO THIS LEAD 
AGAIN ON 
TWO HUNDRED M. IT IS EIGHT LENGTHS THE TIME 
WHEN YOU NEED TO PICK IT UP IS HERE 
THE AUSTRALIANS ARE LOOKING GOOD 
BUT THE REST OF THE FIELD IS NOT 
CAREFUL THESE AUSTRALIANS ARE 
GOING TO GET AWAY KENRICK MONK IS ON FORM HE DID WELL IN THE AUSTRALIAN TRIALS LOOK AT THAT AND UNBELIEVABLY 
SNEAKY SWIM TYPICALLY AUSTRALIAN 
IF THEY GET THE OUTSIDE LANES THAT 
IS WHAT HAPPENS THEY DID IT GREAT 
AS A TEAM DAVID CARRY FINISHED IN SEVENTH SLOWER THAN HIS HEATS TIME WE ALWAYS SAY IT IS THE FAVOURITE PLACE TO BE IN LANE FOUR KENRICK MONK I BET HE DIDN'T 
EXPECT THAT SIX FASTEST QUALIFIER 
FOR THIS FINAL GOLD AND SILVER TO 
AUSTRALIA AND THE ITALIAN HAS TO BE 
HAPPY WITH THE BRONZE MEDAL 
DAVID THAT RACE DIDN'T GO TO PLAN 
ABSOLUTELY A DISASTER 
DID YOU SLIP 
ON THE BLOCKS 
YES IT IS THE FIRST 
TIME THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME 
MAYBE I WAS TRYING TO PUT TOO MUCH 
POWER DOWN IN THE BEGINNING BUT IT 
WAS NOT GOOD 
YOU STARTED TO GET 
WAVES WAY YOU AWARE OF THAT THE THE PLAN WAS TO GET OUT THERE AND STAY 
AHEAD OF THE WAVES BUT I HAVE TO 
WORK SO HARD TO COME BACK LEVEL I I KNOW IT WASN'T THE RESULT YOU WANT 
BUT I KNOW YOU WILL WORK HARD FOR 
THE RELAY 
WE WILL WORK HARD FOR 
THAT I HOPE I DON'T START LIKE 
THAT THE FOUR HUNDRED IS MY BEST EVENT AND 
I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT 
WE TALKED YESTERDAY HOW SHORT 
COURSE SWIMMING IS SO UNFORGIVING 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE MISTAKES 
TIME TO MAKE OF MISTAKES 
HE HAD 
OBVIOUSLY SLIPPED AND CUT HIS FAULT 
THE SURFACE OFF THE BLOCKS IS VERY 
ROUGH AND SOMETIMES YOU SEE THE 
SWIMMERS ROBBING A TOWEL OVER IT TO 
MAKE SURE IT IS NOT WET HE DID NOT 
GET IT RIGHT IT IS UNUSUAL THE THE DIFFERENCE IN SIZE BETWEEN DAVID 
CARRY AND THE WINNER KENRICK MONK 
IN THE COMMENTARY YOU WERE ALMOST 
IN AWE OF HIM 
HE IS A BIG MAN L. 
WAS TALKING TO THEN TITLEY TODAY 
AND THE JET THE BRITISH TEAM 
SEEMS GENERALLY SMALLER BUT DAVID 
CARRY IS NOT VERY BIG AND THAT 
WOULD SUIT THE LONG COURSE BETTER 
KENRICK MONK HE HAS NO HOBBIES 
PRESUMABLY HAS NO TIME BECAUSE HE 
IS TRAINING FAVOURITE SUMMER IAN 
THORPE WHERE IS IAN THORPE NOW 
NOBODY KNOWS OF THE AUSTRALIANS 
WILL KNOW I PRESUME 
HE IS IN LOS 
ANGELES TO TRY TO BREAK INTO THE 
MOVIE BUSINESS 
WHICH WOULD 
CONTINUE A GREAT TRADITION OF 
SWIMMERS IN FILMS 
IT WOULD BUSTER BUSTER CRABBE AND 
NOT REALLY I WAS IN 
CHANNEL FOUR WHEN THEY LAUNCH 
CHANNEL FOUR AND THEN MY CAREER 
REALLY TOOK OFF WHEN I WENT OUT TO 
HOLLYWOOD 
WHO NEEDS CALIFORNIA HOLLYWOOD LAST NIGHT WE HAD THE WOMEN'S TWO HUNDRED M. 
FLY AND THIS IS EXCITING FOR YOUNG 
BRITISH SWIMMERS BECAUSE WE HAD EIGHTEEN 
YEAR OLD JEMMA LOWE AND JESSICA 
DICKONS WHO IS A YEAR YOUNGER AND 
THEY HAVE THE SAME CLUB AND THE 
SAME COACH WE HAVE A TWO BRITISH TEENAGERS HERE THE TWO BRITISH GIRLS IN THREE 
AND FOUR AND NEVER AT A WORLD CAUGHT SHORT 
CHAMPIONSHIPS HAS GREAT BRITAIN ONE 
TWO MEDALS NEITHER THE MEN ALL THE 
WOMEN SHORT COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS THE AMERICAN IS CERTAINLY RELAXED 
JESSICA DICKONS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD THE 
FIRST OF TWO BRITISH SWIMMERS AND 
THEIR COACH GRAHAM ENTWISTLE WHAT 
IS HE DOING WITH THE FLIGHT 
PROGRAMME JEMMA LOWE EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE 
BRILLIANT FLY LEG IN THE EUROPEAN 
CHAMPIONSHIPS BUT WHAT AN OLYMPIC 
TRIAL SHE HAD IT IS GOING TO BE TIGHT BIG PRESSURE SITUATION HERE A SEVENTEEN 
YEAR OLD AND EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD FROM GREAT 
BRITAIN GOING IN SHE IS GOING OUT 
QUICK 
YOU HAVE TO MANAGE THE QUICK NERVES AND SOMETHING SHE TALKED 
ABOUT AFTER THE HEATS SHE ENJOYS 
RACING AND GETTING AMONGST THESE 
WOMEN THE FASTEST IN THE WORLD AND 
TAKING THE RACE TO THEM A GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY FOR A COUPLE OF MEDALS 
JEMMA LOWE IS A MANAGING IT ALL AND 
SO FAR THE BRITS HAVE NOT MANAGED 
THE PRESSURE WELL THE REAL 
CHALLENGE WILL BE GALVANISED IF YOU GET N. T. S. FOR GOING FOR IT 
JEMMA LOWE HAS AN AWFUL LOT OF 
POINTS IN THE BAG SHE IS 
UNDERNEATH THE WORLD RECORD PACE BY 
HALF A SECOND SHE REALLY HAS GONE 
FOR IT 
WE HOPE SHE CAN HOLD ON TO 
IT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING BETTER 
FOR A BRITISH CROWD TO SEE A 
BRITISH SWIMMER BREAKING THE WORLD 
RECORD IN A BRITISH POOL U. S. A. IS COMING BACK IN SIX JESS 
DICKONS IN THREE IS STARTING TO 
MAKE MOVE THIS COULD GO ANYWHERE 
IT IS GOING TO BE TOUGH DOWN HIS 
LAST TWENTY FIVE METRES 
I HATE TO THINK 
JESS DICKONS AND JEMMA LOWE WELL 
JEMMA LOWE HAS DONE ALL WORK FOR UP 
THE WORLD RECORD JESS DICKONS IS 
COMING BACK VERY STRONGLY 
THIS IS 
GOING TO BE TOUGH MARY DESCENZA OF THE U. S. A. IS WORLD 
CHAMPION ON THE TWO HUNDRED M. BUTTERFLY THE 
SILVER GOES TO FELICITY GALVEZ AND 
JESSICA DICKONS GETS THE BRONZE 
SHE CAME BACK VERY STRONGLY A 
GREAT RESULT FOR HER JESSICA 
DICKONS AT TWO HUNDRED FIVE IS A BRITISH RECORD 
BY OVER HALF A SECOND A BRILLIANT 
SWIM FOR HER YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT 
TO JEMMA LOWE FOR GOING FOR IT BUT 
PERHAPS SHE WENT TOO QUICKLY YOU YOU WILL HAVE TO CHILL THAT DOWN WITH 
EXPERIENCE SHE PACED THAT POORLY 
BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO CONGRATULATE 
JESSICA DICKONS WE WERE TALKING 
ABOUT JEMMA LOWE FOR CERTAIN THAT 
BRITISH RECORD BUT JESSICA DICKONS 
HAS TAKEN IT BACK THERE 
BUT KING 
RAT DONATIONS TO JEMMA LOWE AS WELL 
SHE WENT FOR IT CONGRATULATIONS 
TO JEMMA LOWE 
SHE WILL HAVE TO 
TALK IT DOWN TO EXPERIENCE YOU 
HAVE GOT TO LEARN HOW TO PACE YOUR 
SET SHE WILL FIND THAT OUT IT IS 
HARD TO FIND THAT OUT THAT THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS WHEN YOU HAVE A 
CHANCE OF A MEDAL AND THEN YOU COME 
IN FOR 
SHE CANNOT BELIEVE IT 
YOU COME IN FOURTH IF YOU GO FOR IT 
THAT IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN WORLD CHAMPION IS MARY DESCENZA OF THE U. S. A. SHE GETS THE GOLD A NEW BRITISH RECORD FOR JESSICA 
DICKONS A GOOD SWIM FROM BOTH OF 
THE BRITISH LADIES THERE 
CONGRATULATIONS YOU WENT FOR IT 
UNTIL THE VERY END 
IT IS MY LAST 
RACE TONIGHT SO I KNEW I HAD TO 
GIVE IT ANYTHING AND SEE WHAT I 
COULD GET OUT OF THESE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 
THIS WAS YOU CHAMPIONSHIPS OLYMPICS REALLY 
YES BECAUSE I 
HAVE MISSED OUT ON THE OLYMPICS 
THIS IS MY MAIN EVENT NOW 
IT HAS 
BEEN VERY STRANGE TO BE TEAM MATES 
ACTUALLY YOU ARE RACING EACH OTHER 
AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE WORLD 
GEMMA YOU GAVE IT EVERYTHING 
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD PUT IT DOWN TO 
EXPERIENCE 
I WAS MORE NERVOUS EXPERIENCE TONIGHT AND I WAS THIS MORNING L. 
GOT EXCITED AT THE END L. STILL 
ENJOYED IT 
YOU HAD A GREAT WEEK 
LAST WEEK SO SOMETHING IS BOUND TO 
BE TAKEN OUT OF YOU TELL US ABOUT 
THE INTRODUCTION WE HAVE BEEN 
HEARING HOW NERVE RACKING IT IS TO 
COME OUT WITH THIS CROWD 
I WAS A 
BIT WORRIED ABOUT THAT THEY TOLD 
US ABOUT THE SPOTLIGHT AND I WAS 
WORRIED ABOUT THAT BUT I ENJOYED IT 
WELL DONE OUR FIRST MEDAL WELL 
DONE DONE ADMIRABLY HONEST FROM JEMMA LOWE 
JESSICA DICKONS REALLY FINISHED 
STRONGLY SHE TAKES BRONZE MEDAL 
AT THE WORLD SHORT COURSE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS TO TAKE HOME ALONG 
WITH GOLD MEDAL SHE WON AT THE 
JUNIOR CHAMPIONSHIPS 
SHE HAD A 
GREAT SEASON LAST YEAR SHE IS 
THERE DURING BUT SHE IS VERY SAD 
NOT TO BE PART OF THE OLYMPICS TEAM 
THESE ARE HER OLYMPICS 
AND IT DID 
SHE MISS IT BY 
I THINK SHE WAS 
THIRD YOU HAD TO DO THE QUALIFYING 
TIMES AND THE HEATS WHICH WERE RUN 
IN THE EVENING AND THEN YOU HAD TO 
BE IN THE THURSDAY IN THE FOLLOWING 
DAY AND THAT JUST DID NOT HAPPEN TO 
HER THE IDEA FOR THAT WAS TO MIMIC 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE OLYMPICS 
YOU HAD TO BE IN THE FIRST TWO IS IS SHE GOING TOO FAST HEAD OF WORLD 
RECORD PACE 
ABSOLUTELY SHE WENT 
OUT FAR TOO FAST BUT SHE IS YOUNG 
AND EXCITED SHE IS HAVING A GREAT 
WEEK SHE HAS QUALIFIED FOR THE 
OLYMPICS SHE IS IN GREAT FORM IT 
IS JUST A TOUGH ONE IT IS A WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS SHE IS CAPABLE OF 
THE GOLD MEDAL L. STILL BELIEVE SHE 
IS THE BEST SWIMMER IN THAT FIELD 
BUT SHE DID NOT GET THE RIGHT PACE 
AND YOU NEED TO DO THAT TO GET A 
GOLD MEDAL BUT HAVE A SECOND AND A 
WORLD RECORD PACE AND THEN REALLY 
IT WAS THE LAST TEN WHEN MARY 
DESCENZA AND FELICITY GALVEZ CAUGHT 
UP LAST TERM IT IS HERE WHEN IT 
IS REALLY HURTING AND YOU CANNOT 
GET YOUR ARMS OUT THERE IS NOTHING 
WORSE 
THIS IS THEIR FIRST REAL WORSE MAJOR MEAT IT IS MUCH BETTER FOR 
HER TO MAKE A MISTAKE HERE THAN IN 
THE SUMMER 
YES BUT I THINK SHE 
WILL REGRET IT FOR ME 
SHE MUST BE 
FEELING SICK AND THAT IS WHAT IS 
DIFFICULT LOOKING BACK AT THAT AND 
KNOWING SHE IS BETTER 
THAT IS THE 
HARDEST THING YOU BEAT YOURSELF UP 
LOOKING AT THAT SHOT OF MARY 
DESCENZA WE HAVE FOUND IAN THORPE 
IF SHE HAD DONE THAT WE WOULD HAVE 
KNOWN 
SHE COULD BE HIS SISTER AND KNOWN NOBODY WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT BEING 
COMPARED TO HIM 
SHE BROKE A WORLD 
RECORD SET IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE THE OLDEST 
RECORD IN THE BOOK 
NOW TO THE MOST 
PUNISHING EVENT OF ALL ROUND 
SWIMMING ABILITY GREAT BRITAIN 
HAVE A RISING STAR IN THIS AND THE 
FASTEST QUALIFIER EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD 
HANNAH MILEY FROM SCOTLAND 
THIS IS 
ONE WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR 
HANNAH MILEY GOING UP NEXT IN THE 
FOUR HUNDRED M. MEDLEY WHAT CAN HANNAH MILEY DO HERE SHE 
IS IN LANE FOUR 
I THINK SHE WILL 
DO WELL SHE CHOSE TO SWIM AT THE 
HEAT VERY FAST INDEED BUT SHE DID 
NOT NEED TO SWIM IT THAT FAST SHE 
DECIDED TO GO FOR TIME AND MY 
WORD DID SHE GO FOR A TIME UNDER 
FOUR MINUTES THIRTY SECONDS THE FOURTH 
FASTEST IN HISTORY AND SHE SWUNG 
BACK IN A HEAT 
WE KNOW THAT THE 
OLYMPICS WILL HAVE THE FINALS IN 
THE HEATS FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS WE 
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SWIMMING 
HOPING THAT THE BRITISH SWIMMERS 
WOULD SWIM QUICKLY IN THE MORNINGS 
TO QUALIFY AND WE HAVE THAT EXCUSE 
THAT THEY DO NOT BREAK UP IT IS 
GREAT TO SEE PEOPLE GOING FOR IT IN 
THE HEATS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE 
ABLE TO REPLICATE SEVERAL TIMES A 
WORLD CLASS WING 
YOU DO BUT 
INTERESTINGLY IN LANE ONE SHE HAS 
ONLY QUALIFIED SEVENTH FASTEST AND SHE 
DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT 
YES SHE IS 
THE FASTEST IN THE WORLD AT THE 
MOMENT BEFORE THIS EVENT IS THAN 
THE FASTEST TIME BEFORE HANNAH 
MILEY SHE IS ONE TO LOOK OUT FOR 
IT IS DIFFICULT IN THESE EVENTS 
WENT THE FIELD IS SPREAD OUT 
MIREIA BELMONTE IS ALSO VERY GOOD 
SECOND FASTEST IN THE WORLD THIS 
YEAR SHE WAS IN HANNAH MILEY'S 
HEATS 
THEY ARE COMING FROM ALL HEATS OVER THE WORLD HELEN NORFOLK 
REPRESENTING NEW ZEALAND SHE IS 
THIRD FASTEST QUALIFIER FOR THIS 
FINAL I SAID THEY CAME FROM ALL 
OVER THE WORLD NORFOLK IN THREE 
AND COVENTRY IN FIVE BUT COVENTRY 
IS FROM ZIMBABWE ABOUT A LONG 
COURSE WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD 
MEDICINE MAY INDEED A HUGE OVATION 
FROM THE CROWD EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD HANNAH 
MILEY THE NEW BRITISH RECORD 
HOLDER SHE BROKE IT BY THREE 
SECONDS THE FIRST BRITON EVER 
UNDER FOUR MINUTES THIRTY SECONDS 
FASTEST IN THE WORLD THIS YEAR SHE SHE SAID THAT SHE WANTED TO RAISE THE 
BEST IN THE WORLD HERE IS KIRSTY 
COVENTRY SHE HAS ALREADY SET A 
WORLD RECORD THIS YEAR IN THE TWO HUNDRED M. 
BACKSTROKE WE EXPECTED TO BE THERE 
OR THEREABOUTS COVENTRY IS 
SOMEBODY YOU JUST DO NOT MESS WITH 
I REALLY HOPE THAT HANNAH MILEY IS 
JUST STAYING CALM THIS IS THE 
MOMENT THAT THE NERVES WILL BE 
JANGLING YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 
WHAT YOU CAN DO BEST AND IT IS HER 
TO WIN IT REALLY IS EVEN THOUGH 
SHE IS SO YOUNG L. THINK COMMENTARY 
WILL BE THREATENED BY THIS BUT SHE 
IS A TOUGH RACE THERE KIRSTY 
COVENTRY WILL BE THREATENED SHE IS 
A TOUGH RACER THE FINAL OF THE WOMEN'S FOUR HUNDRED M. 
INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY IN THE WORLD 
SHORT COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS GREAT 
BRITAIN AGAIN WITH THE FASTEST 
QUALIFIER THIS TIME IT IS HANNAH 
MILEY THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD FROM 
SCOTLAND WE SHOULD NOT WORRY TOO 
MUCH ABOUT THIS FIRST TWO HUNDRED M. THE 
HALFWAY SHE IS A GOOD BUTTERFLY 
SWIMMER BUT BACKSTROKE KIRSTY 
COVENTRY IS EXTREMELY FAST INDEED 
IN LANE FIVE 
THEY WILL BE SOMETHING 
TACTICAL WITH THE MIDDLE LANES 
HANNAH MILEY AND KIRSTY COVENTRY 
SHE ALSO BROKE THE RECORD AT THIS 
EVENT EARLY LAST YEAR BUT THEN THE 
AUSTRALIANS CLAIMED IT BACK AT THE 
AUSTRALIAN TRIALS HANNAH MILEY HAS 
BRIEFLY HELD THE BACKSTROKE RECORD 
SHE IS IN FORM HANNAH MILEY WILL HAVE 
TO BE CLOSE TO THE LEAD AT THE END OF THE BACKSTROKE 
SHE HAD A THREE SECOND BACKSTROKE ADVANTAGE IN THE BREASTSTROKE LEG 
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE REST OF 
THE FIELD IS GOING SLOWLY THEY ARE GOING A BIT FASTER THAN THE HEATS THIS MORNING KIRSTY 
COVENTRY IS LEADING AN NEEDS TO 
MAKE SURE THIS IS AN EXTREMELY GOOD 
ONE NEEDS SHE HAS GOT TO MAKE HIS BASE BUT 
SOME CLEAR WATER BETWEEN HER AND 
HANNAH MILEY SHE HAS GOT TO MAKE 
THIS PLACE SHE LOOKS GOOD BUT I DO 
NOT KNOW IF IT WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH 
FASCINATING 
KIRSTY COVENTRY LOOKS FASCINATING EXTREMELY SMOOTH HANNAH MILEY IN 
SECOND PLACE IN MEDAL POSITION 
KIRSTY COVENTRY THERE AS WELL SHE 
ALREADY HAS THE SEMI FINAL IN THE 
BACKSTROKE HANNAH MILEY JUST 
FALLING OFF BUT SHE DOES STILL LOOKED 
COMFORTABLE HANNAH MILEY 
I DO 
THINK THAT KIRSTY COVENTRY LOOKS 
COMFORTABLE AS WELL THE AIR THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE MADE NOW THE EFFORT SHE IS GOING EXTREMELY FAST INDEED HANNAH MILEY IS SWIMMING RIGHT ON 
HER BEST TIME BUT KIRSTY COVENTRY 
IS GOING FOR IT RIGHT NOW THE 
BREASTSTROKE LEG FOR HANNAH MILEY 
WAS GOOD THIS MORNING SHE IS 
STARTING TO COME BACK 
THIS IS 
GREAT TO SEE L. DO NOT THINK SHE 
HAS DONE TOO MUCH WE SUGGEST THAT 
THEY DO TOO MUCH IN HER FIRST ONE HUNDRED M. 
BUT HANNAH MILEY HAS 
SAVED TWO SAVED ENOUGH WE SAW JESSICA DO TOO 
MUCH IN HER FIRST ONE HUNDRED M. BOTH THESE 
WOMEN COULD GET CLOSE TO THE WORLD 
RECORD COMMENTARY WILL GO AND DO 
IT KIRSTY COVENTRY SHE WILL GO 
UNDER IT AT THE MOMENT IT IS KIRSTY COVENTRY BUT HANNAH MILEY IS COMING BACK SHE CHOSE TO SWIM IT HARD AND I 
THINK THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO 
DO THAT SHE WILL BE A LITTLE BIT 
TIRED FOUR LENGTHS FREESTYLE TO GO 
KIRSTY COVENTRY LEADING UNDER WORLD 
RECORD PACE STILL SHE IS TWO HIS RECORDS AND OF THE 
WORLD RECORD PACE HAS SHE GONE OUT 
TOO QUICKLY TWO SECONDS UNDER 
THE WORLD RECORD PACE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A DISASTER NOW 
FOR KIRSTY COVENTRY TO LOSE IT 
STILL TWO SECONDS AND A WORLD 
RECORD PACE COMING BACK VERY FAST 
IS MIREIA BELMONTE OF SPAIN THAT 
SEEMS TO BE SPARING ON HANNAH MILEY 
SHE IS STARTING TO COME BACK SHE 
IS CERTAINLY COMING BACK HANNAH 
MILEY IS CLOSE TO KIRSTY COVENTRY 
KIRSTY COVENTRY FROM ZIMBABWE 
WORLD CHAMPION IN THE BACKSTROKE 
IS GOING TO BE THE WORLD CHAMPION 
AT THE SHORT COURSE MEDLEY A NEW 
WORLD RECORD KIRSTY COVENTRY OF 
ZIMBABWE A BRILLIANT SWIM FROM HER 
HANNAH MILEY HAS AGAIN GONE UNDER 
COMMONWEALTH RECORD FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN AND 
MASSIVE BRITISH RECORD AGAIN 
HANNAH MILEY HAS BROKEN THE OLD 
WORLD RECORD THAT STOOD BEFORE 
TODAY A GREAT PROGRESSION A GREAT 
SILVER MEDAL KIRSTY COVENTRY HAS A 
BIT TOO MUCH EXPERIENCE FOR HERBERT 
HANNAH MILEY HAS A GREAT CAREER 
AHEAD OF HER 
A VERY GUTSY SWIM 
SHE MISS THE GOLD BY SEVEN TENTHS 
OF A SECOND AN UNBELIEVABLE SWIM I HAVE GOT TO 
SAY THAT WAS AN ABSOLUTELY 
BRILLIANT SWIM 
VERY PLEASING TO 
SAVE THAT SHE DID NOT RUSH SHE 
STAYED CALM AND DEALT WITH THE POOR 
THE PRESSURE OF A WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
SHE STARTED OFF AS CHAMPIONSHIP FASTEST QUALIFIER WHICH IS 
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT 
HANDLE THE 
PRESSURE VERY WELL SHE DID NOT LET 
KIRSTY COVENTRY GET AWAY WE KNEW 
THAT SHE WOULD GO AHEAD ON THE 
BACKSTROKE BUT HANNAH MILEY PULLED 
IT BACK ON THE BREASTSTROKE DOES 
NOT QUITE ENOUGH THERE IS A LOT 
THERE HANNAH MILEY IS STILL QUITE 
SMALL COMPARED TO KIRSTY COVENTRY 
SHE HAS DONE A LOT OF POWER 
TRAINING IN THE UNITED STATES 
GREAT STUFF 
HER FATHER PATRICK 
HER COACH HE MUST BE SO HAPPY IT 
IS A FAMILY AFFAIR I KNOW THAT YOU ARE LISTENING IN TO 
KIRSTY OVER THERE A FANTASTIC RACE 
INSIDE THE OLD WORLD RECORD 
CANNOT WIPE THE SMILE OFF MY FACE 
IT IS PHENOMENAL AM HERE TO RACE 
I DO NOT CARE WHAT THE TIME WAS 
HAD SOMEBODY TO RAISE AND IT WAS 
JUST FANTASTIC AM SO PLEASED FOR 
KIRSTY BECAUSE YOU NEED THE 
SWIMMERS TO PURSUE ON AND SWIMMING 
MOVES ON IT IS GREAT TO SEE THAT 
PUT YOU ON 
YOU DID NOT GIVE UP 
YOUR BREASTSTROKE WAS BRILLIANT AND 
THE CROWD WAS HOLDING THEIR BREATH 
I COULD HEAR THEM BECAUSE IT WAS SO 
LOUD IT WAS THE MOTIVATION THAT 
YOU NEEDED YOU WONDER HOW FAST YOU 
WOULD GO WITHOUT HOME CROWD IT IT MUST BE SO EXCITING WITH THE 
OLYMPICS LOOMING IT IS BACK TO THE 
HARD WORK BUT YOU CAN GET IN WITH 
THESE GIRLS AND CHASE THE GOLD 
MEDALS 
IT IS QUITE SCARY TO THINK MEDALS THAT I HAVE A CHANCE OF GETTING A 
MEDAL THIS IS MY FIRST SENIOR 
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL MY LAST 
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL WAS AT THE 
JUNIORS WHEN I GOT SILVER AND 
THAT THE WORLD SHORT COURSE I GOT 
SILVER I DO NOT WANT TO MAKE A 
HABIT OF GETTING SILVERS 
A WORLD RECORD FANTASTIC SHE WAS 
CHASING YOU WASN'T SHE 
I COULD SEE 
HER COMING OH MY GOD L. JUST TRIED 
TO HOLD ON 
YOU HAVE DONE SEVERAL 
WORLD RECORDS THIS YEAR BUT THIS 
WAS VERY SPECIAL 
IT HASN'T BEEN A 
FOCUS EVENT BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN 
REFOCUSED EVENTS OVER THE PAST TWO 
YEARS IT IS ONE OF THE EVENTS WAY 
YOU CAN DROP A SIGNIFICANT BIT OF 
TIME 
IT IS ALSO HARD WORK AND THIS TIME CROWD LOVED IT WELL DONE 
NOT A BAD ACHIEVEMENT TO BE RUN UP 
IN THE FASTEST EVER WOMEN'S SHORT 
COURSE FINALS HANNAH MILEY TAKES 
HER FIRST INTERNATIONAL MEDAL WE 
COULD SEE HER IN GOLD MEDAL 
POSITION IN THE FUTURE 
SHE IS 
STILL IMPROVING SHE IS ONLY EIGHTEEN L. 
THINK SHE NEEDS A BIT MORE MUSCLE 
BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU CANNOT KNOCK IT 
BECAUSE SHE HAS JUST RAN A 
FANTASTIC RACE SHE HAS ROOM FOR 
IMPROVEMENT AT THE BACK END ON HER 
FREESTYLE HER BREASTSTROKE IS 
PHENOMENAL 
THE BREASTSTROKE IS PHENOMENAL WHERE SHE MADE UP SOME DISTANCE AND 
HER TURNS WERE VERY GOOD SHE HAS A 
GOOD CHANCE IN BEIJING 
THE SHE 
SEEMS TO LOVE IT 
SHE IS SO SWEET 
IT IS ALL NEW TO HER IT IS HER 
FIRST SENIOR MAJOR MEDAL SHE PUT A 
BIG PRIORITY ON THE RACING AND TO 
BE ABLE TO STICK AT IT UNDERNEATH UNDERNEATH SHE IS SHE COPED WITH THAT VERY 
WELL 
A FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT FOR WELL HANNAH MILEY WATCH OUT FOR HER 
NOW THE RELAYS AND THE MEN'S FOUR 
TIMES ONE HUNDRED M. THE MEN WERE COMING UP 
AGAINST THE U. S. A. AUSTRALIA AND THE 
DUTCH HERE ARE THE BRITS IT WAS A VERY 
FAST HEAT TO MAKE THIS FINAL 
AUSTRALIA ARE IN LANE THREE ITALY 
WON IT RUSSIA TWO HOLLAND IN FOUR 
U. S. A. IN FIVE THE SPLITS FROM THIS 
MORNING THERE WERE SOME VERY FAST 
SWIMMERS IT IS INTERESTING THEY HAVE FLICK 
THE ORDER ROUND FROM THIS MORNING 
THEY MUST HAVE HAD A CONVERSATION 
ABOUT WHICH POSITION SUITED WHICH 
SWIMMER U. S. A. IS IN FIVE BRITAIN IN SIX AND SWEDEN IN SEVEN 
IT IS ITALY AT THE TOP THEY ARE NOT SLOW BEN HOCKIN IS GOING OUT WELL IN THAT BLUE HAT BRITAIN LEADING INTO THE TURN THEN HARKING HANDING OVER TO CRAIG GIBBONS GIBBONS IT TIGHT TAKEOVER YOU CAN GIBBONS SET A WORLD A BRITISH RECORD ON THE 
FIRST LEG IT IS A GOOD FIRST LEG A MASSIVE 
LIFETIME BEST AND A GOOD LEAD OFF 
FROM THE BRITISH TEAM IT LOOKS 
LIKE IT IS AUSTRALIA IN SECOND THE 
DUTCH HAVE BEEN GIVEN A DIFFICULT 
LANE ASSIGNMENT HUGE WAVES THESE 
GUYS ARE MAKING 
THE AMERICANS ARE 
SWIMMING INTO THEIR OWN WAVES AS 
WELL I THINK THE BRITISH HAVE PUT 
ALL THEIR EGGS IN THE FIRST TWO 
BASKET I THINK IT WILL BE HARD TO 
GET A MEDAL FROM HERE THE THE AMERICANS HAVE ONE SECOND THEY 
ARE ONE SECOND UNDER WORLD RECORD 
PACE 
HIS FINGERS ALMOST A PART OF PACE THEIR WHEN HE RECOVERS THE THERE YOU GO HIS FINGERS ARE A 
LITTLE BIT APART 
GREAT BRITAIN ARE 
SWIMMING VERY WELL THE WORLD RECORD HAS GOT TO GO NOW 
MATTHEW CLAY HAS HANDED OVER TO 
ROSS DAVENPORT FOR THE LAST LEG 
THE DUTCH ARE HAVING BIT OF A 
RACE THE AMERICANS ARE PULLING 
THEM ALONG THINK THE DUTCH AND 
ALSO THE SWEDISH ARE UNDER THE 
WORLD RECORD PACE 
THE U. S. A. ARE 
LEADING AND THE DUTCH ARE CATCHING 
UP AMERICA WERE GETTING TIRED ANOTHER 
WORLD RECORD WHAT A GREAT SWIM 
THEY PUT THEIR FAST GUYS FIRST AND 
THAT WAS A SUPER SWIM AMERICA GET 
THE GOLD HOLLAND THE SILVER AND 
SWEDEN THE BRONZE L. THINK GREAT 
BRITAIN WERE IN SIXTH PLACE 
A NEW 
BRITISH RECORD AGAIN JUST KNOCKED 
A SECOND OFF IT YOU CANNOT ASK FOR 
MUCH MORE IT'S JUST THAT THE OTHER 
GUYS ARE QUICKER 
A HOPE WE GET A 
SLIM WERE WOMEN WERE THERE ISN'T 
HER ARE NOT MASSIVE WAVES IT IS STILL HARD FOR THE AMERICANS 
WOULD THOSE WAVES WE TALK ABOUT IT 
BEING HARD FOR EVERYBODY ELSE 
BLESS THEM A NEW WORLD RECORD FOR 
THE U. S. A. THAT IS STUNNING THEY 
HAVE KILLED THE WORLD RECORD 
THAT WAS A GOOD START 
I LET OFF A 
GOOD TIME FOR THE GUYS ALL THE 
GUYS COME TOGETHER WE BROKE THE 
BRITISH RECORD SO WE CANNOT 
COMPLAIN 
IT GOT A BIT WAVEY IN COMPLAIN THERE IT WAS 
VERY WAVY AT TIMES THERE VERY CHOPPY TOWARDS THE END 
IT IS 
ALWAYS NICE TO BE IN A RACE WON THE 
WORLD RECORD IS BROKEN ISN'T IT 
YES IT IS GOOD THERE WERE BIG 
WAVES BUT TO SEE THE WORLD RECORD 
GOAL IN THE SAME RACE AS US IT IS 
GOOD TO BE INVOLVED 
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK 
I THOUGHT IT WAS FANTASTIC THINK WALKING OUT IN FRONT OF THIS CROWD 
I FELT LIKE A BOXER IT IS AMAZING 
TO COME OUT HERE AND SWIM IN FRONT 
OF A CROWD LIKE THIS IT IS A GREAT 
ENVIRONMENT 
THIS IS PROBABLY NOT ENVIRONMENT OUR BEST RELATE WITH THE GUYS 
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FOUR 
BY TWO 
YES I AM AND THAT IN THE 
MORNING 
YOU GO AND REST MORNING I HAVE A GREAT JOB I AM NOT 
COMPLAINING COMPLAINING THE U. S. A. BEAT THE WORLD RECORD BY 
JUST OVER ONE SECOND HELPED BY A 
RYAN LOCHTE'S LEAD OFF NORMALLY 
THE FIRST LEG IS SWARM ABOUT HALF A 
SECOND SLOWER THAN ANY OTHERS 
BECAUSE 
WHEN 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE OVER BECAUSE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO BE ROLLING SO YOU CAN BE MOVING IT TAKES ABOUT 
HALF A SECOND OFF YOUR TIME ON ON THIS PARTICULAR RELAY MATT CLAY HE 
WENT FOR GREAT BRITAIN HAD HIS FOOT 
ON ZERO HE WAS RIGHT ON THE EDGE HE 
DID ENOUGH TO GET THE BRITISH 
RECORD AGAIN IN THE FINAL IS 
FANTASTIC BUT IT IS NOT QUITE 
THERE AMONGST THE WORLD'S BEST 
RYAN LOCHTE IS PUTTING HIMSELF UP 
FOR ALL SORTS OF RECORDS HE WON 
SIX MEDALS IN SHANGHAI HOW MUCH DO 
YOU ADMIRE HIS ABILITY TO SWIM 
ACROSS RANGE OF RACES 
HE IS VERY 
SIMILAR TO MICHAEL PHELPS YOU HAVE 
TO BE VERY VERSATILE TO DO LOTS OF 
DIFFERENT THINGS WHEN I SPOKE TO 
HIM AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK HE 
WAS USING IT AS A TRAINING EXERCISE 
BUT HIS FOUR HUNDRED MEDLEY IS THE MAIN 
EVENT AND HE WILL BE DOING THAT AS 
WELL AS HE CAN 
I COULD ONLY DO ONE 
STROKE I ADMIRE HIM IT TAKES A 
LOT OF ENERGY A LOT OF CAPACITY 
HOW MUCH TRAINING 
IT IS VERY TOUGH 
WE ARE GOING TO THE MOST EXCITING 
RACE OF THE NIGHT LAST NIGHT AND 
THIS WAS THE WOMEN'S FOUR BY TWO HUNDRED M. 
FREESTYLE RELAY JO JACKSON MEL MARSHALL KATE 
MCCLUTCHIE AND REBECCA ADLINGTON 
FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE FOUR 
REAL WORLD TITLE CONTENDERS IN ONE 
RACE IN THIS FREESTYLE RELAY THIS 
COULD BE SOMETHING SPECIAL ADRIAN 
THE DOOR OPENS AND THE BOXERS 
WALKOUT THE LIGHTS ARE FLASHING 
AND THE CHINESE WILL LEAD OUT THE 
SWIMMERS YOU ARE RIGHT ANDY 
BETWEEN THE DUTCH 
ANYTHING BETWEEN THE DUTCH AMERICANS THE AUSTRALIANS AND THE 
BRITISH TEAM NOT ONLY CAN WE WIN 
IT BUT THE WORLD RECORD COULD GO 
HERE THEY WILL PUSH IT ALL THE WAY 
IT IS A CHINESE WORLD RECORD HERE HERE THEY ARE THE CHINESE AND THAT 
WORLD RECORD SET IN MOSCOW A DON'T 
EXPECT THE CHINESE THE TEAM TO PUSH 
I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE SENT THEIR 
STRONGEST TEAM BUT THIS TEAM IS 
VERY STRONG FROM THE U. S. A. THEY CAN 
GET A MONTH AN ADULT NOW GREAT 
BRITAIN WHAT CAN YOU DO JO JACKSON 
CAITLIN MCLETCHIE REBECCA 
ADLINGTON HAD AN UNBELIEVABLE 
OLYMPIC TRIALS SHE WON THE TWO HUNDRED M. 
FREESTYLE I THINK IF ANYONE IS 
GOING TO BEAT THE BRITISH IT IS 
THESE LADIES THE AUSTRALIAN TEAM SO ADRIAN THIS TWO HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE 
RELAY AND WE HAVE FOR QUICK BRITISH 
WOMEN 
I AM LOOKING AT 
THE NAMES ON WOMEN THE SHEET AND I THINK THIS TEAM CAN 
WIN THIS IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY 
WE SAW MEL MARSHALL THIS MORNING IN 
ONE OF THE HEATS WE HAVE SOME VERY 
FAST SWIMMERS ARE MAKING THEIR 
ENTRANCE INTO THIS WORLD MEAT ON 
DAY ONE ONLY SIX TEAMS IN IT THEY 
DID NOT SHOW THEIR CARDS THIS 
MORNING IF YOU LIKE WE ARE 
GETTING EXCITED APPEAR BECAUSE WE 
DO HAVE A VERY GOOD CHANCE WE CAN 
GO FROM BRONZE TO SILVER TO GOLD 
IT IS A BIG CHALLENGE THE FINAL OF THE WOMEN'S FOUR BY TWO HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE YOU CAN SET A RECORD ON THE FIRST 
LEG OF A RELAY JOANNE JACKSON 
LEADING FOR GREAT BRITAIN JOANNE JACKSON SWIMMING AGAINST 
AUSTRALIA'S FASTEST BRONTE BARRATT 
AUSTRALIA DECIDED TO PUT THEIR 
FASTEST TWO HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE ON THE 
LEAGUE LEAD BRONTE BARRATT LEAD 
LEG I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE IN 
BRITAIN'S FAVOUR JOANNE JACKSON IS 
TOUGH A BRITON 
IS RIGHT IN THERE BUT IT IS A LONG RACE EIGHT LEGS EACH BRITAIN THREE LEGS DOWN AND IT IS LOOKING 
VERY GOOD INDEED FOR GREAT BRITAIN 
JOANNE JACKSON IS HANGING ON TO 
BRONTE BARRATT VERY WELL INDEED 
SHE LOOKS GOOD INGE DEKKER IS ALSO 
GOING WELL AT THE TOP THAT IS FROM 
HOLLAND I AM SURPRISED BECAUSE I THOUGHT 
THE AUSTRALIANS WOULD BE FASTER 
JOANNE JACKSON IS MORE OF 
DISTANCE FREESTYLE IF THIS 
CONTINUES SHE WILL START TO SWIM 
AWAY 
THAT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE AWAY INGE DEKKER WILL NOT LET GO WITHOUT 
A FIGHT 
I AM AS SURPRISED AS YOU 
ARE JOANNE JACKSON IS PERHAPS HALF 
A SECOND AHEAD IF YOU CAN BROWSE 
ARE NOW IN THESE IF SHE CAN PUSH 
ON NOW THEN SHE WILL BE DOING VERY 
WELL GREAT BRITAIN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
PICTURE HOLLAND AT THE TOP SECOND 
IF THEY CAN SWIM A LITTLE BIT 
FURTHER AND FASTER THEY WILL START 
GIVING WAVES TO THE SWIM IS IN LANE 
THREE AND FOUR THAT MAKES IT EXTREMELY 
DIFFICULT SWIMMERS 
THAT AT THE 
TIME THAT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY SWIM 
LOOK AT STUNNING 
A GREAT FIRST 
LEG FROM JOANNE JACKSON THE 
NOMINAL PHENOMENAL 
THE YOUNGER SWIMMERS ARE TAKING THE RAISON THE AMERICANS AND THE RAISON AUSTRALIANS ARE IN THIRD AND FOURTH 
WHICH IS NICE IF AT THE MOMENT MELANIE MARSHALL DID NOT HAVE GREAT 
OLYMPIC TRIALS THE DUTCH ARE NOW 
STARTING TO LOOK GOOD THEY ARE THE 
WORLD RECORD HOLDERS IN ONE HUNDRED M. RELAY 
FREESTYLE THIS IS TWO HUNDRED M. BUT 
PROBABLY AT THE MOMENT MELANIE 
MARSHALL IS THE WEAKEST OF THE 
BRITS SHE HAS JUST STARTED MOVING 
SHE HAS STARTED DIGGING IN MELANIE 
MARSHALL MIGHT NOT BE THE QUICKEST 
BUT SHE IS DEFINITELY THE TOUGHEST 
SO YOU WILL HAVE THE USE EVERY 
OUNCE OF THAT PAIN BARRIER SHE 
WILL HAVE TO IT IS A TEAM EVENT AND MELANIE 
MARSHALL KNOWS THAT SHE WILL BE 
WORKING EXTREMELY HARD THE DUTCH 
ARE SWIMMING AWAY THEY HAVE GOT 
MARLEEN VELDHUIS SHE IS EXTREMELY 
QUICK CAITLIN MCCLATCHEY WILL HAVE 
SOME WORK TO DO TO MAKE UP THIS TWO 
IS SECONDS GAP THAT IS WHAT I 
THINK IT IS C. WILL HAVE TO START 
MOTORING BUT I FEEL CONFIDENT 
SHE WILL IT IS A HALFWAY MARK OF THE 
FREESTYLE RELAY HOLLAND ARE IN 
FIRST AND GREAT BRITAIN SECOND WITH 
AUSTRALIA THIRD AND AMERICA WAY 
DOWN IN FOURTH THEY ARE FOUR SECONDS 
AND THEN THE WORLD RECORD SET BY 
THE DUTCH TEAM MARLEEN VELDHUIS IS 
VERY QUICK UNDER THE WORLD 
RECORD THE AUSTRALIANS ARE IN THE YELLOW 
LANE BUT THE DUTCH HAVE SET UP COMMANDING LEAD I AM NOT TO WORRY THAT THE MOMENT BECAUSE 
VELDHUIS IS AN 
BECAUSE MARLEEN VELDHUIS IS AN EXTREMELY FAST SPRINTER CAITLIN 
MCCLATCHEY IS MUCH BETTER ON THE 
FOUR HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE L. WILL HOPE THAT 
SHE WILL START READING IT IN SHE 
HAS TWO AND A HALF LENGTHS TO DO IT 
CAITLIN MCCLATCHEY TIME TO MOVE 
NOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ME AUSTRALIA 
ARE JUST STARTING TO CATCH UP 
KELLY STUBBINS IS HAVING A VERY 
GOOD LEG REBECCA ADLINGTON WILL 
END THIS FOR GREAT BRITAIN SHE 
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE FINAL LEG 
CAITLIN MCCLATCHEY IS REALLY 
TOUGHING IT OUT 
ALL THREE TEAMS 
ARE UNDER THE WORLD RECORD THE 
DUTCH ARE SO FAR UNDER L. AM PRETTY 
SURE WE WILL SEE A WORLD RECORD BUT 
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE BRITISH 
CAN BRIDGE THE GAP REBECCA 
ADLINGTON HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO 
CAITLIN MCCLATCHEY HAS STARTED 
MAKING A BIT OF A MOVE THAT SHE 
WILL HAVE TO WORK HARDER L. THINK ADLINGTON WILL NEED MORE THAN THIS THE GAP IS CLOSING BUT IT NEEDS TO 
COME CLOSER 
IT IS CLOSING AND VERY 
QUICKLY SHE IS THE EUROPEAN RECORD HOLDER 
FOR ONE HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE SHE HAS HAD A 
GOOD LEG BUT CAITLIN MCCLATCHEY HAS 
CAUGHT UP HOLLAND HAVE SENT THEIR 
FASTEST GUYS OFF ALREADY GREAT 
BRITAIN ARE AT TWO AND THEY HAVE 
THEIR FASTEST SWIMMER IN THE WATER 
NOW REBECCA ADLINGTON FOR 
AUSTRALIA THAT IS KYLIE PALMER AND 
THE REST OF THE FIELD OUR WAY BACK 
THE DUTCH AT EIGHT SECONDS UNDER 
THE WORLD RECORD 
EGAN TOOK WORLD 
RECORD HERE THE THIRD WORLD RECORD 
OF THE EVENING GUARANTEED WORLD 
RECORD BUT I THINK IT IS TOO MUCH 
FOR THE BRITS TO CATCH UP REBECCA 
ADLINGTON WILL HAVE THE SWIM OF HER 
LIFE WE KNOW SHE IS ON FORM AND 
HAVE FANTASTIC TRIALS SHE IS GOING 
TO CATCH HER REBECCA ADLINGTON I 
THINK SHE WILL DO IT L. WONDER IF 
THE DUTCH ARE PLAYING WITH AS THE 
CROWD ARE STARTING TO GET IN IT HOLLAND IN THE BLACK CAP THEY ARE 
LEADING THERE ARE STILL FOUR 
LENGTHS TO GO AND REBECCA ADLINGTON 
IS CATCHING UP MIGHT IT IS ME IT 
IS GOING TO BE A WORLD RECORD AND 
HIS GREAT BRITAIN GOING TO GET IT 
MY GOODNESS ME WE HAVE A BRONZE 
MEDAL SO FAR AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT 
WILL BE A GOLD AS WELL COME ON 
GREAT BRITAIN 
I THINK THAT REBECCA 
ADLINGTON CAN CATCH THIS WE CANNOT 
WRITE OF THE AUSTRALIANS THEY ARE 
EXTREMELY TOUGH IRELAND IN THE TOP 
OF YOUR PICTURE HOLLAND REBECCA 
ADLINGTON WILL BE THE HERO OF THIS 
WEEK IF SHE CATCHES THIS BUT THE 
DUTCH ARE DIGGING IN VERY DEEP IT 
IS GOING TO BE SO CLOSE THEY ARE 
TIMED EXACTLY TOGETHER AS THE 
DUTCH WOMAN LEFT SOMETHING LOOK AT 
THE AUSTRALIAN COMING BACK AS WELL 
KYLIE PALMER FROM AUSTRALIA THE 
DUTCH ARE HANGING ON THE 
AUSTRALIANS ARE THERE IT IS GOING 
TO BE MY WORD IT IS HOLLAND THE GOLD HAS GONE TO HOLLAND THE 
SILVER IS SIX ONE HUNDREDTH OF A 
SECOND BEHIND GREAT BRITAIN A 
MASSIVE WORLD RECORD L. CANNOT 
BELIEVE HOW BAD DUTCH WOMAN SWAM 
THAT LAST LEG HAVE THAT'S DUTCH 
WOMAN SHE WAS JUST SO SLOW THAT 
SHE TURNED IT ON REBECCA ADLINGTON 
THE WHOLE GREAT BRITAIN TEAM AS 
WELL JOANNE JACKSON MELANIE 
MARSHALL CAITLIN MCCLATCHEY AND 
REBECCA ADLINGTON WHAT A GREAT 
RACE THAT WAS 
I AM TRYING TO GET 
MY BREATH BACK REBECCA ADLINGTON 
CLOSE SUCH A HUGE GAP WE ARE 
TRYING TO WORK OUT EXACTLY WHAT 
TIME SHE DID BUT IT WAS PHENOMENAL 
THE DUTCH PUT THEIR SLOW IS SWIMMER 
RIGHT AT THE END AND PUT ALL THEIR 
EGGS IN ONE BASKET SLOWEST SHE DID NOT QUITE HAVE ENOUGH TO 
TOUCH OUT THE GREAT SWIM A 
MASSIVE WORLD RECORD YES THE DUTCH WENT OVER FIRST THREE VERY TIRED LADIES THAT WAS THE RACE OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP SO FAR FOR ME UTTERLY 
BRILLIANT THE DUTCH TEAM WORLD 
RECORD HOLDERS IN THE FOUR TIMES 
ONE HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE RELAY FOR WOMEN NOW 
WORLD RECORD HOLDERS IN THE TWO HUNDRED M. AS 
WELL I WONDER IF THE BRITISH GIRLS 
CAN GROW THEIR FINGERNAILS A LITTLE 
BIT SIX ONE HUNDREDTH OF A SECOND 
A STUNNING RACE FOR GREAT BRITAIN A MASSIVE MASSIVE BRITISH RECORD A COMMONWEALTH RECORD FOR THEM 
AUSTRALIA GET THE BRONZE LOOKING LOOKING AT YOUR FACE IS I WANT TO SAY THAT 
WAS THE MOST AMAZING SWIM FACES 
BUT 
YOU SWAM BRILLIANTLY L. KNOW YOU WISH YOU HAD SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIS IN YOU 
YOU WENT OFF FIRST 
I AM REALLY 
HAPPY WITH MY SWIM THE GIRLS WERE 
AMAZING WE ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT 
WE ONLY GOT TO SECOND AND WE NEARLY 
HAD IT BUT WE SHOULD BE SO PLEASED 
WITH OURSELVES TONIGHT WE WERE SO 
FAR UNDER THE WORLD RECORD AND WE 
HAVE SMASHED THE BRITISH RECORD WE 
ARE SO 
OURSELVES AND 
IT SHOWS THAT WHAT WE DID LAST WEEK 
CAN BE DONE AGAIN 
SO MUCH 
CONFIDENCE FOR THE SUMMER THERE 
YES THIS IS OUR OLYMPIC RELAY TEAM 
AND I AM SO EXCITED TO BE PART OF 
SOMETHING GREAT IT IS FANTASTIC 
WE GAVE IT OUR FIRST GO TODAY AND 
WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF 
OURSELVES BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE VERY 
WELL 
WE HAVE BEEN SCRABBLING ROUND WELL TO WORK OUT YOUR SPLIT BUT 
WHATEVER IT WAS IT WAS AWESOME 
THANK YOU I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED 
I DID NOT GET THAT GIRL L. THOUGHT I HAD L. HAD NOTHING LEFT AFTER 
LAST WEEK IT WAS SO HARD TO COME 
AND DO IT BUT I GAVE IT MY ALL AND 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT BUT WE CAME 
SECOND 
PLEASE DO NOT BE SECOND DISAPPOINTED THAT WAS AMAZING WE 
HAVE SEEN THAT RACE AND OUT OVER 
MANY YEARS IT WAS JUST FANTASTIC 
YES THE CROWD WERE BEHIND US 
TONIGHT APART FROM BEING A GOOD 
LOOKING TEAM THIS IS A TEAM THAT 
WILL BE SOMETHING EXCITING THIS 
SUMMER 
THREE MEDALS SO FAR FROM SUMMER THE WOMEN TONIGHT YOU SHOULD BE 
PRETTY PROUD OF YOURSELF I GUESS 
DEFINITELY VERY PROUD 
ENJOY THE 
MEDAL CEREMONY THAT WAS GREAT BY THE TIME THEY GOT TO THE MEDAL 
CEREMONY MELANIE MARSHALL WAS 
LOOKING A BIT DISAPPOINTED BUT 
THEY REALISE WHAT AN ACHIEVEMENT 
THAT WAS AND WHAT GREAT RACE TO 
BE A PART OF THE TOP THREE WAS BUT 
BY ONLY ONE ONE ONE ZERO ZERO OF A SECOND WERE 
SPLIT ELEVEN ONE HUNDREDTH OF A SECOND 
HOW MUCH CAN HIS TEAM IMPROVE 
REBECCA IS FAIRLY NEW TO THIS BUT 
SHE IS IMPROVING ALL THE TIME THEY 
SPLIT WAS A PERSONAL BEST BY THREE 
OR FOUR MICROSECONDS HEARSE BLIP COMING TO THE FINAL STAGES NOW HE 
SAID JOKINGLY THAT THEY WILL HAVE 
TO GROW THEIR FINGERNAILS 
WE HAVE 
BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT YOU DO 
HAVE TO TOUCH WITH YOUR FINGERTIPS 
BECAUSE YOU WILL BREAK YOUR NAILS 
OTHERWISE I THINK WHEN THE GIRLS 
AND THE COACHES LOOK AT THIS THEY 
CANNOT CRITICISE ANYBODY THAT WINS 
A WORLD MEDAL BUT YOU DO NEED TO 
ANALYSE THIS WHERE CAN THEY GET A 
LITTLE BIT HERE OR THERE THEY ARE 
ALL THINKING ABOUT THAT L. M. P.'S THEY 
ARE A BIT DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE WE 
WANT PEOPLE THAT WANT TO WIN I 
AM PLEASED THE INTERESTING THING 
ABOUT THIS IS THAT ALL FOUR TEAMS 
BROKE THE OLD WORLD RECORD THE 
AMERICANS ALSO BROKE IT AND DID NOT 
EVEN GET A MEDAL THAT MUST HURT 
SOMETIMES IT IS WHERE THE STRIKE 
FINISHES THESE GUYS TALK ABOUT 
THAT WHEN THEY ARE DOING COMMENTARY 
HOW WELL YOU HIT THAT BALL WHETHER 
YOU TOUCH IT FIRST YOU CAN TOUCH 
IT FIRST PUT YOUR HEAD MIGHT BE 
FURTHER AWAY IT DEPENDS ON YOUR 
STROKE JOANNE JACKSON GOT 
PERSONAL BEST AS WELL EXCITING 
STUFF 
IF THEY ARE GOING TO DO STUFF SOMETHING WITH THEIR FINGERNAILS 
THEY NEED THEM LIKE YOURS THEY THEY WERE NOT LIKE THAT IN MY DAY THEY THEY ARE FAKE 
EXCUSE ME 
ON TO THE 
SEMI FINALS NOW BUT THAT SUPPORT 
OF THE FINALS THAT WE HAD LAST 
NIGHT KATE HEYWOOD WAS DOWN THOSE 
NINETY OF THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THREE SHE IS TWENTY ONE OUT 
TRAINING IN LOUGHBOROUGH KATE 
HEYWOOD WAS YOUNG IT SPORTS 
PERSONALITY OF THE YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND THREE IN THE YELLOW HAT OF AUSTRALIA IN 
LANE FIVE IS JADE EDMONSTONE IT IT YOU CANNOT GET A GOOD START YOU 
ARE NOT GOING TO WIN THESE RACES 
KATE HEYWOOD HAD A GREAT START AND 
SHE HAS A GREAT RACING STYLE A GREAT SWING FROM KATE HEYWOOD 
JUST OUTSIDE THE BRITISH RECORD 
BUT ALIVE TIME BEST SHE SWAM SO 
WELL AT THE OLYMPIC TRIALS TO WIN 
THE ONE HUNDRED BREASTSTROKE AND NEW 
BRITISH RECORD THEIR TO GO TO THE 
GAMES SHE IS IN GREAT SHAPE SHE SHE IS IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR 
BREASTSTROKE TO GET ON TOP OF THE 
WATER IT IS A BIT LIKE SURFING 
THE SILVER CAP THREE FROM THE TOP 
JADE EDMONSTONE HAVING A FANTASTIC 
START LAUNCHING THEMSELVES OUT OF 
THE WATER 
SO THE RUSSIAN WINNING 
THE FIRST SEMI FINAL KATE HEYWOOD QUALIFIES FOR THE 
FINAL YOU MAY REMEMBER A ZOE BAKER 
REPRESENTING GREAT BRITAIN SHE IS 
NOW REPRESENTING NEW ZEALANDER 
WATCH OUT FOR HER IN LANE THREE THE START IS ALL IMPORTANT AND A 
VERY GOOD START INDEED FROM THE 
RUSSIAN IN SEVEN A SHOCKING START 
THE JESSICA HARDY SHE HAS A 
MASSIVE AMOUNT TO DO L. DON'T KNOW 
WHAT HAPPENED IF SHE DOES NOT MAKE 
THIS FINAL SHE HAS A HUGE AMOUNT 
TO DO ZOE BAKER LOOKS GOOD IN THE 
SILVER CAP FOR NEW ZEALAND JUST DOUBLE A. 
HARDY COMING BACK WHAT A GREAT 
SWIMMER MATT WAS FROM HER BECAUSE 
SHE HAD A SHOCKING START 
ZOE BAKER 
THAT IS A GOOD SWIM FOR HER SHE 
GOT OFF TO A FLYING START AND DID 
NOT LET GO OF THE RACE SHE HAS HAD 
A GREAT CAREER IN ENGLAND AS A 
BRITISH SWIMMER BEFORE SHE MOVED TO 
NEW ZEALAND HOLDING THE BRITISH 
STILL NOT TOO FAR AWAY FROM 
THE TIME SHE JUST SWAM 
IN ACTUAL 
FACT I THINK IT WILL PUT HER IN 
THE SECOND FINAL FASTEST L. DON'T 
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO JESSICA HARDY 
SHE WAS MILES BEHIND 
I WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT SHE SAYS 
ABOUT THE BLOCKS IF SHE SLIPPED 
AGAIN THERE THEY WILL HAVE TO DO 
SOME WORK ON THAT 
ZOE BAKER THE SECOND FASTEST 
QUALIFIER THAT IS AT SEVEN TWENTY FIVE P. M. 
TONIGHT THE TOPS OF HER NAILS ARE 
FIBREGLASS ZOE BAKER SWIMMING FOR 
NEW ZEALAND IS THERE ANY CHANCE OF 
HER COMING BACK TO SWIM FOR BRITAIN 
AND WOULD SHE BE ALLOWED TO I I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WOULD BE ALLOWED 
TO SHE CAME OVER TO ME AFTER THAT 
RACE AND WE HAD A CHAT THE REASON 
WHY SHE LEFT US BECAUSE OF BILL 
SWEETNAM SHE COULD NOT GET ON WITH 
HIM IN A SIMILAR WAY TO MARC 
FOSTER SHE IS A MAVERICK AND WANTS 
TO SWIM 
WHERE IS IT BILL SWEETNAM 
GOING NOW 
HE IS GOING TO NEW 
ZEALAND SHE IS VERY UPSET BECAUSE 
SHE CANNOT SWIM WITH HIM IT IS NOT 
A MATTER OF WANTING TO USE SWIM 
FOR NEW ZEALAND SHE LEFT FOR SHE 
HAD TO 
WOULD YOU GIVE HER CHANCE 
IN THAT FINAL TONIGHT 
SHE HAS A 
FANTASTIC CHANCE HER KICK IS 
STRONGER THE RUSSIAN IS ALSO VERY 
STRONG THE RUSSIAN IS SIXTEEN ZOE ZOE BAKER IS THIRTY TWO 
WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO THE ONE HUNDRED M. 
BACK FOR THE MEN 
THIS IS THE 
SECOND SEMI FINAL OF THOSE LIAM 
TANCOCK BROKE THE BRITISH RECORD IN 
HIS HEAT THEY ARE LOUD FIFTEEN METRES UNDERWATER 
OFFICE STAFF TINY LITTLE BUTTERFLY 
CAKES 
LIAM TANCOCK GOT GREAT START IN FIVE BUTTERFLY CAKES ALSO GOING WELL IS PETER MARSHALL LIAM TANCOCK GOING DEEP ON THAT TURN IF YOU GO PAST FIFTEEN METRES YOU ARE 
DISQUALIFIED IMMEDIATELY LIAM 
TANCOCK SET A LIFETIME BEST IN THE 
HEATS I THINK HE IS ON FOR THAT IT IS GOING TO BE TIGHT TO MAKE THE 
FINAL I DON'T THINK HE HAS MADE IT 
MAYBE JUST 
WITH THE BENEFITS OF 
COMPUTERS ON OUR DESK WE NOTICE HE 
QUALIFIES IN EIGHTH PLACE HE JUST 
SNEAKS INTO THE FINAL HE DIED 
QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY TIRED TOWARDS 
THE END L. WONDER IF HE WENT TOO 
QUICKLY TOO EXCITED ON THE FIRST 
TWENTY FIVE METRES HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE 
ROGAN'S LAST TERM HE DID GET A 
FANTASTIC LAST TERM L. THINK THAT 
IS WHERE HE WON THE RACE THAT LEAD 
ABOVE MARSHALL AT THE TOP OF THE 
PICTURE DID THAT ON THE LAST TERM 
HE IS THE REAL THREAT TOMORROW HE HE ONLY HAS TO QUALIFY THIRD FASTEST 
FOR THE FINAL L. THINK THE FIRST 
SEMI THE GUY'S GOT A LITTLE BIT 
SCARED THIS IS THE SECOND SEMI 
IS IT A BAD LANE THAT FINAL WILL 
BE AT SEVEN THIRTY P. M. TONIGHT 
IT DOES NOT 
MATTER IN A POOL WHERE THE WAVES GO 
OVER THE EDGE IT WAS DESIGNED TO 
HAVE THE FASTER SWIMMERS IN THE 
MIDDLE BECAUSE OF THE OLD VICTORIAN 
POOLS WHERE THE WAVES BOUNCE OFF 
THE EDGE AND BOUNCED BACK AT YOU 
HE IS NOT THE FIGHT SO THAT SPURS 
YOU ON TO BE A FASTER SWIMMER L. 
THINK LIAM TANCOCK WILL TRY TO WIN 
IT HE 
WILL GO FROM THE WORD GO HE HE WILL HAVE SHAVED EVERYTHING BY TONIGHT 
INCLUDING HIS CHIN IT TONIGHT IT TAKES THE TOP LAYER OF SKIN OFF AS 
WELL 
YOU ARE AN EXPERT NOW LET'S WELL LET'S MOVE ON TO THE MEN'S ONE HUNDRED M. 
BREASTSTROKE THE SEMI FINAL WHICH 
FEATURED RYAN LOCHTE THIS IS THE FIRST SEMI FINAL OF THE MEN'S ONE HUNDRED BREASTSTROKE RYAN LOCHTE IN FIVE ONE OF MICHAEL 
PHELPS'S MAIN RIVALS HAS CHOSEN NON SPECIALIST EVENTS HERE GIBBONS HAS BEEN TRAINING IN FRANCE 
HE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD HE NORMALLY 
RUSSIA'S IT BUT HE IS LOOKING VERY 
GOOD THIS IS WIDE OPEN JAMES 
GIBSON HAS A START A VERY GOOD SECOND FIFTY M. HE MUST 
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THAT THAT IS 
UNUSUAL FOR JAMES THAT PACING WAS 
VERY GOOD GIBSON WILL HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED 
WITH THE TRIALS BUT CAME BACK 
STRONGLY 
GIBSON NORMALLY FALLS STRONGLY AWAY IN THE SECOND FIFTY BUT CONTROL 
THE FIRST 
ABSOLUTELY HE WILL HAVE 
TO LOOK AT THIS PACING AND SEE HOW 
HE CAN ADJUST ITS LIKELY BECAUSE HE 
NEEDS TO BE FURTHER AHEAD HE WAS 
LOOKING OVER AGAIN AT LOCHTE AS 
WELL BUT LOCHTE WAS NOT EVEN IN 
THE RACE HE CAME FIFTH HE WILL BE 
IN THE FINAL EASILY WITH THAT 
GIBSON IT WILL BE HIS BIG 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AS WELL EUROPEAN EUROPEAN LONG COURSE CHAMPION QUALIFIES 
FIRST BEEN MATT FIRST SEMI FINAL 
THE JAMES GIBSON IN THIRD A GOOD 
SWIM 
SWIM FROM HIM 
YOU CAN FIND OUT TONIGHT AT EIGHT TWENTY P. M. 
WE WILL BE ON INTERACTIVE AT THAT 
TIME ALSO LUCY SIMMONDS IN THE FIVE HUNDRED 
METRES BACKSTROKE 
WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS OTHER 
ISSUES IN SWIMMING INCLUDING THE 
SWIMSUIT AND THIS ONE BILLED AS THE 
FASTER SWIMSUIT IN THE WORLD 
FASTEST 
THE AIM IS TO CUT THROUGH THE WATER 
WOULD BE ALMOST OVER E.'S AND THE 
SUIT COSTS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MADE TO MEASURE 
BECAUSE ONE SIZE WON'T FIT ALL IT 
WILL LOOK GOOD ON THE CATWALK OR ON 
CAT WOMAN NINETEEN WORLD RECORDS HAVE 
BEEN BROKEN SINCE FEBRUARY A TEAM 
WEARING THE SUIT INCLUDING IAN 
HANCOCK 
SOME OF THE FASTEST TIMES HANCOCK IN THE WORLD BEING PRODUCED IN THE 
SUITS AND I AM PLEASED TO BE PART 
OF IT 
I FEEL LIKE I AM SWIMMING 
DOWNHILL WHEN I PUT IT ON 
IT GIVES 
YOU THE FEELING OF SLICING THROUGH 
THE WATER 
THEY HAVE MADE A 
FANTASTIC PRODUCT IN THESE SUITS 
AND I AM SURE MORE RECORDS WILL GO 
AT THE OLYMPICS 
PLENTY OF RESEARCH 
HAS GONE INTO THIS IT TOOK THREE 
YEARS TO DEVELOP AND WAS TESTED BY 
NASA IT REDUCES THE FRICTION OF 
TRACK THAT SLOWS THE SWIMMER DOWN 
AND IT IS AIMED TO MAKE THE BODY AS 
STREAMLINED AS POSSIBLE MARK 
FOSTER WILL HAVE TRIED OUT MANY 
SUITS IN HIS CAREER HE HAS BEEN 
TALKING TO SHARRON DAVIES 
WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL 
IT IS A 
FABRIC A PAPER FABRIC AND AT 
CERTAIN POINTS THEY HAVE PUT 
SILICON OVER THE TOP THE BIGGEST 
THING IS IT HAS TAKEN ALL THE 
SCENES THERE IS NO STITCHING ANY 
MORE WHICH IS THE BIGGEST THING 
IT IS ABOUT THE FLOW OF WATER OFF 
YOUR BODY 
IS IT COMFORTABLE NOT NOT BAD UNCOMFORTABLE IN CERTAIN PARTS 
WHATEVER IT DOES FOUR TIMES IT 
DOES MORE FOR THE MENTAL STATE OF 
THE SWIMMER 
THERE IS LOTS OF 
DIFFERENT ADVANTAGES TO ALL THE 
SUITS ON THE MARKET AT THE MOMENT 
YOU HAVE TO FIND ONE THAT MENTALLY 
I FEEL COMFORTABLE IN AND MAKES ME 
FEEL STRONG AND FAST 
I LIKE IT 
MORE FOR FREESTYLE INSTEAD OF 
BUTTERFLY STILL PLAYING AROUND 
WITH IT AND TRYING TO GET USED TO 
WORK FOR BUTTERFLY 
IT WILL HELP ME 
A LOT BECAUSE I WILL PROBABLY NEED 
IT IT NOW EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME THERE 
HAS BEEN AN AMOUNT OF CONTROVERSY 
AROUND THE SWIMSUIT OUR SPEEDO 
MAKING IT ON THEIR OWN 
IT IS NOT 
THE SUIT THAT BREAKS RECORDS IT 
HELPS THE FLOW OF WATER OVER THE 
BODY IF IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY 
SCENES IT MIGHT HELP YOU HAVE TO 
FEEL COMFORTABLE IN WHAT YOU WERE 
THERE ARE KEY ITEMS BUT SPONSORS 
GET A BIT UPSET 
BECAUSE ADIDAS IS 
LINKED IN WITH THE BRITISH TEAM AND 
THEY DON'T WANT THEM WEARING SPEEDO 
THEY HAVE CONTRACTS AND THAT IS 
THEIR CONTRACT EQUIPMENT WE CAN 
WORK THE SAME SWIMSUITS AND GOGGLES 
BECAUSE THAT IS TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT 
WHY DID THE CANADIANS BANNER SUED 
BECAUSE IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO 
ANYBODY NOT EVERYONE GOT ACCESS TO 
IT SO TO MAKE IT FAIR THEY SAY NO 
SUITABLE STOCK BECAUSE IT WAS TOO 
EXPENSIVE 
O. K. SO THERE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE ENOUGH OF THEM 
LET'S LOOK AT THE WAY THE SUITS 
HAVE CHANGED OVER THE YEARS SINCE 
THE DAYS THAT YOU WERE SWIMMING I I USED TO WEAR THAT ONE 
LET'S LOOK 
AT THE DEVELOPMENT 
I DID HAVE ONE 
OF THOSE 
BEFORE YOU HAD YOUR NAILS 
ON 
DID YOU 
SWIM IN ONE OF THOSE ON ADRIAN THAT DID EITHER OF YOU ADRIAN THAT SWIM IN AND ALL IN ONE 
I DID NOT 
RACE IN THEM BUT I HAVE WORN ONE 
I HAVE WORN ONE AS A GIMMICK 
IS IT 
UNCOMFORTABLE IN ALL OF THOSE 
AWKWARD PLACES 
WE CAN LEAVE THAT 
BEHIND US AND LOOK FORWARD TO SOME 
OF THE STARS WE CAN BE CHEERING ON 
TONIGHT IT IS A BIG DAY FOR FRAN 
HALSALL SHE IS EIGHTEEN AND SHE IS A BIG 
MANCHESTER UNITED FAN SO SHE WAS 
PLEASED THIS MORNING LAST WEEK OF 
THE BRIDGES QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE 
OLYMPICS SHE QUALIFIED IN THREE

DONE A LOT OF RACE PREPARATION IT

OUT OF ME SO MUCH BUT I HAVE HAD A 
COUPLE OF DAYS NOW WHICH HAVE BEEN 
RELAXED STAYING IN A POSH HOTEL 
THAT HAS BEEN GOOD IT IS MENTALLY 
HARD BUT WEAK IN WEEK OUT WE GET 
IN THE POOL AND EVERY WEEK IT IS 
HARD WORK WE KNOW WHAT IT FEELS 
LIKE TO BE MENTALLY PUT UNDER 
PRESSURE THAT MUCH HOPEFULLY THAT

RANGE OF EVENTS WHICH ONES ARE YOU 
TARGETING MOST WAS EXCESS PROBABLY PROBABLY MY ONE HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE AND THE RELAYS L.

HAD TO GET UP AND SWIM FIRST THIS 
MORNING SO I TRIED TO FOCUS ON

FRANCESCA HALSALL TWO GREAT 
BRITAIN AND BEGINS THEY ARE IN THE 
SLOWEST HEAT THIS IS IT TIME TRIAL

ENJOYING WAVING TO THE SCHOOL 
CHILDREN 
YES IT IS GREAT TO SEE CHILDREN THEM HERE THEY SEEM TO BE ENJOYING 
IT THE MORE PEOPLE WE CAN GET IN 
THE BETTER 
SECOND RACE SECOND 
BRITISH RECORD FOR YOU NOT BAD FOR 
ONE MORNING'S WORK 
DOWN THE SECOND 
LEG I GOT A BIT EXCITED AND CHO 
DONG SOME WATER HOPEFULLY TONIGHT 
I WILL BE ABLE TO DO BETTER 
CHOKED ON SOME WATER 
FIFTY M. WAS A BIT 
SHORT FOR YOU BUT WEIRD TO BE IN 
THE FIRST HEAT AS WELL 
WE ARE USED 
TO RACING EACH OTHER IT WAS FUN I 
ENJOYED IT 
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE 
ENJOYING THE WHOLE EVENT WELL DONE 
FRANCESCA HAS TWO SEMI FINALS 
TONIGHT WHAT DOES SHE DO BETWEEN 
THEM DOES SHE WORN DOWN 
YES SWIM 
DOWN IT IS ABOUT GETTING THE 
LACTIC ACID OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM 
BEHIND THAT SCOREBOARD IS ANOTHER 
SWIMMING POOL AND THEY GO THERE FOR 
THEIR SWIM DOWN GET A MASSAGE AND 
GO OUT AGAIN 
EVERY TRAINING 
SESSION WILL BE FIVE THOUSAND M. IT SO TWO 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY IS NOT MUCH 
SO COMPETING IS 
EASIER 
YOU ARE RIGHT BUT IT IS A EASIER QUESTION OF QUALITY SHE IS VERY 
CAPABLE OF DOING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY METRES LAST 
IT IS THE TRAINING THAT YOU REALLY 
HAVE TO ADMIRE IN SWIMMERS THAT GO 
ON FOR A LONG TIME NOBODY SWIMMER 
HAS EVER GONE ON FOR LONGER THAN 
MARK FOSTER NO BRITISH SWIMMER 
HE WAS THE BIG STORY WHEN HE 
QUALIFIED FOR HIS FIFTH OLYMPICS BY 
THE TIME WE GET TO BEIJING HE WILL 
BE THIRTY EIGHT YEARS OLD WE WENT TO HAVE A 
CHAT WITH HIM ABOUT IT UNBELIEVABLE THE GRAND OLD MAN OF THE POOL HAS DONE IT IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS MARK FOSTER 
YOUR FIFTH OLYMPIC GAMES REALLY IT 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR SIX WHAT ARE 
YOUR MEMORIES OF THE FIRST ONES 
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT 
I WAS THE YOUNG ONE ON THE TEAM EIGHTEEN 
IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE 
ENJOYING THE OLYMPIC VILLAGE 
ENVIRONMENT AND LOOKING UP TO 
PEOPLE LIKE LINFORD CHRISTIE 
ADRIAN WARMEST L. WAS A CHILD AND 
IT WAS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE BUT 
IT WAS WONDERFUL L. DID IT BECAUSE 
I WAS GOOD AT DOING IT RATHER THAN 
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WOULD DO IT FOR 
A LONG PERIOD OF TIME 
SO NOW HOW 
IS IT DIFFERENT 
I KNOW THERE IS 
NOT MUCH TIME LEFT AT THIRTY EIGHT YEARS OF 
AGE THIS WILL PROBABLY BE MY LAST 
BIG COMPETITION BUT IT MEANS SO 
MUCH MORE AS YOU GET OLDER YOU 
APPRECIATE THINGS A LOT MORE WHEN 
I WAS EIGHTEEN I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE 
WOULD BE ANOTHER TIME BUT THERE IS 
NO OTHER TIME NOW NOW IS NOW SO SO YOU ARE GOING TO GO 
I AM GOING TO 
GO EVERYBODY'S MINORITY SPORTS 
DREAM IS TO GO TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
I WOULD BE STUPID NOT TO GO SO SO PART OF THE SECRET TO YOUR 
LONGEVITY IS DIVERSITY IN TRAINING 
KEEPING IT INTERESTING HAVING 
OTHER THINGS IN YOUR LIFE AS WELL 
AND ALSO IT HAS GOT TO BE BECAUSE 
YOU ARE NATURAL SPRINTER YOU ARE 
BORN THAT WAY YOU CANNOT MAKE 
SOMEBODY A FAST FIFTY M. FREESTYLE 
PERSON 
I HAVE FAST FIBRES IF I PERSON WAS LIKE PAULA RADCLIFFE I WOULD BE 
DOING THE ONE MILE OR THE TEN 
KILOMETRE OF KILOMETRES L. DID A 
LOT OF TRAINING LIKE THAT AS WE 
ALL DID WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER THERE 
WE STARTED SPECIALISING 
FORTUNATELY FOR ME I LOVE THE 
ADRENALIN RUSH THE COMPETITIVENESS 
OF RACING AND FRIDAY BE THE 
FASTEST MAN ON THE PLANET THROUGH 
WATER OF THAT WAS THE THING THAT 
DROVE ME TRYING TO BE THE 
FASTEST MAN THROUGH WATER L. WOULD 
NOT STAND ON THE BLOCK UNLESS I 
TRULY BELIEVED THAT I COULD COMPETE 
WHEN COMPETE PODIUM WHATEVER L. 
WOULD NOT GET ON THE BLOCKS IF I 
DID NOT BELIEVE IT 
YOU LOVE THE 
SHORT COURSE 
I LOVE THE SHORT 
COURSE SWIM FAST AND FOREMOST THAT 
IS WHERE THE MAJORITY OF MY SUCCESS 
HAS COME BUT YOU HAVE IT IN 
MANCHESTER I AM LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE 
IN THE COMMONWEALTH GAMES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
AND OTHER CHAMPIONSHIPS BUT TO 
SWIM WITH HOME SUPPORT WILL BE 
PHENOMENAL I THINK WE WILL HAVE 
SOME AMAZING RESULTS A LOT OF IT 
WILL DEPEND ON WHO TURNS UP FROM 
THE OTHER COUNTRIES AND MANY PEOPLE 
WILL NOT BE THERE BECAUSE IT IS THE 
OLYMPICS YEAR FLASHING LIGHTS 
LOUD MUSIC IT WILL BE A WONDERFUL 
EXPERIENCE ESPECIALLY FOR THE 
YOUNGER CHILDREN 
YOU HAVE WON 
MEDALS AT EVERY SINGLE MAJOR EVENTS 
APART FROM THE OLYMPIC GAMES WOULD 
IT BE A DREAM COME TRUE 
IT WOULD 
BE AMAZING THAT IS WHAT IS DRIVING 
ME TO BEIJING L. WOULD BE STUPID 
NOT TO GO BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MY 
DREAM AND EVERYBODY'S DREAM FOREVER 
BUT THAT WOULD BE THE ICING ON THE 
CAKE I WILL NOT TAKE ANYTHING AWAY 
FROM WHAT I HAVE DONE L. HAVE 
ACHIEVED WONDERFUL THINGS BUT THAT 
WOULD BE THE CHERRY 
IF YOU MEASURED SWIMMER'S YEARS 
AWAY YOU MEASURE IT DOG YEARS IT 
IS UNBELIEVABLE HOW OLD HE IS WE 
WILL SEE HOW HE GOT ON IN HIS HEAT 
SHORTLY BUT NOW THE MAIN HEATS FOR 
THE MEN'S FREESTYLE THIS 
ONE 
FEATURES RYAN LOCHTE OF THE U. S. A. VERY INTERESTING LANE ASSIGNMENTS IN LANE ONE RYAN LOCHTE OF THE U. S. A. A DECENT START FABULOUS START 
LOOK AT THAT AT THE TOP OF THE 
PICTURE UNDER THAT BIG WAVE 
LOCHTE AT THE TOP HE IS GOING TO 
HAVE TO GO TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN VERY FAST TIME 
RIGHT FROM THE START HE IS FAST 
THIS IS WHY HE EASED UP ON THE FOUR HUNDRED 
MEDLEY TO SAVE HIMSELF FOR THIS 
HE GOT UNDERNEATH THE WAVE THE 
MASSIVE WAVE A FOLLOWS THE SWIMMERS 
DOWN WHEN YOU TURN AND COME BACUP 
IF YOU HIT THAT WAVE IT STOPS YOU 
IN YOUR TRACKS HE WENT UNDERNEATH 
IT SO HE TURNED THE MEN'S FIFTY M. 
FREESTYLE MATTHEW TO TEA IS IN 
ELAINE TWO HE REALLY IS A FIFTY M. SPECIALIST A 
VERY GOOD START HE IS PROBABLY 
JUST ABOUT LEADING DOWN THIS FIRST 
TWENTY FIVE HE CAME RIGHT UP INTO THE 
MIDDLE OF THE WAVE HE IS STILL 
GOING WELL AT THE TOP NEXT TO HIM 
THE BRAZILIAN HE DID VERY GOOD 
SECOND TWENTY FIVE THAT IS A LIFETIME BEST 
FOR HIM WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT TO 
SEE IF IT IS GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE 
THE FINAL 
THAT WAS A GREAT SWIM BY 
MATTHEW TRAINING DOWN IN BATH 
OCCASIONALLY MARK FOSTER TRAINS 
DOWN THERE A GOOD START THAT 
FIRST TWENTY FIVE HE WAS WAY AHEAD OF THE 
FIELD HE MANAGED TO HOLD THEM OFF 
IN THE END KEEPING HIS HEAD DOWN 
AND NO BREATHING IN THE FINAL FIVE 
OR TEN M. HE WILL BE PLEASED WITH 
THAT IT WILL BE TIGHT WHETHER HE 
WILL GET THE TOP SIXTEEN 
MARK FOSTER 
WHAT A STALWART HE HAS BEEN THIRTY SEVEN 
YEARS OF AGE AND HE HAS JUST MADE 
THE OLYMPIC TEAM AGAIN IT IS HIS 
FIFTH OLYMPIC GAMES HE IS GOING TO 
BE IN 
FOSTER IS IN LANE FIVE VERY GOOD START UP QUICKLY MARC FOSTER RIGHT IN THE CENTRE 
HE IS FAST WHAT A GREAT TURN FROM MARC FOSTER HE HAS WON THIS TITLE FOUR TIMES 
THE LAST ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO HE WILL BE 
IN THE SEMI FINAL WITH THAT 
DOESN'T IT LOOK EASY WHEN YOU ARE 
THAT GOOD NOT GETTING THE BEST 
REACTION TO THE GUN 
MAYBE AT THIRTY SEVEN 
YOUR REACTION TIME SLOWS DOWN A 
BIT VERY STRONG IT LOOKS LIKE HE 
HAS CHANGED HIS STROKE A BIT THAT 
RIGHT ARM LOOKS TO BE GOING HIGHER 
KEEPING HIS HEAD DOWN AND TOUCHING 
OUT THE REST OF THE FIELD HE HAS 
BEEN AROUND SO LONG WE WERE BOTH 
ON THE TEAM WITH HIM IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX HE HE WAS ON THE RELAY THEN AND SWAM VERY 
WELL TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO HE WILL BE IN 
THE SEMI YOU LOOK A LITTLE BIT 
NERVOUS ON THE BLOCK 
IT IS THE FIRST ONE OUT 
THE HEATS 
AND THE SEMIS ARE NECESSARY EVIL 
BECAUSE IT ONLY MATTERS IN THE 
FINAL I GET MORE NERVOUS IN THE 
FINAL I LOVE RACING 
THE GUYS WERE 
SAYING THEY THOUGHT YOUR STROKE HAD 
CHANGED IS A DELIBERATE 
I HAVE 
MADE IT A BIT LONGER IT SEEMS TO 
BE WORKING BUT I NEED TO INCREASE 
MY TURNOVER L. AM CATCHING BETTER 
AND GETTING A LOT MORE WATER BUT 
IF YOU WATCH SOME OF THE BOYS AND 
THEIR ARMS ARE TURNING OVER 
DO YOU 
FANCY YOUR CHANCES TONIGHT YES YES YES I WOULDN'T STAND ON THE BLOCK 
IF I DIDN'T WE ARE ALL THE SAME 
ALL ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS WELL IT 
COMES DOWN TO THIS AT THE END OF 
THE DAY 
HOW MUCH IS THE HAIRY CHIN 
WORTH 
ABOUT A SECOND THAT WAS WORTH JUST PLAYING THIS MORNING 
IT WAS 
VERY GOOD PLAYING 
THE TATTOO THE OLYMPIC RINGS YOU 
CAN SEE HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO HIM 
IT IS HUGELY IMPORTANT WE SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN THERE FOUR YEARS AGO BUT 
HE MISSED THE QUALIFYING TIME ANY 
SENSIBLE PERSON WOULD HAVE PUT HIM 
ON THE TEAM JUST FOR HIS EXPERIENCE 
HE IS PERFORMER AS WELL HE 
ALWAYS DOES IT WHEN HE IS SUPPOSED 
TO DO HE IS EXCITED 
ABOUT BEING 
BACK IN THE WATER AGAIN 
LET'S LOOK 
AT HIM BACK IN THE WATER AGAIN YOU 
COMMENTED HE CHANGED HIS SLOPE 
STROKES LIKELY 
HE IS VERY GOOD AT 
STARTS AND TURNS HE TALKS A LOT 
ABOUT SPEEDING HIS ARMS UP WHAT HE 
IS DOING IS MAKING HIS ARMS SEEMED 
LONGER HE IS REACHING FURTHER IN 
THE WATER HE NEEDS TO COMBINE THE 
TWO THINGS THERE REACH AND 
SPEEDING IT UP BUT THE DANGER IS 
YOU START SNATCHING AT THE WATER 
HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL IT IS 
A HAPPY 
HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL IT IS A HAPPY MEDIUM 
HE HAS GOT THE SEMI FINAL MEDIUM TONIGHT AND THAT IS AT ABOUT SEVEN FIFTY P. M. 
A LOT OF RESTING BEFORE TOMORROW 
THE BIG EVENT TOMORROW HE WILL 
LOVE THIS ARENA AND PERFORMING HERE 
HE IS A PERFORMER WHICH IS WHAT IT 
IS ALL ABOUT 
HANNAH MILEY WE SAW 
HER WIN A SILVER MEDAL YESTERDAY IN 
THE FOUR HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY SHE ONLY 
HAD TO DO A QUARTER OF THAT 
DISTANCE TODAY IN THE HEAT FOR THE 
WOMEN'S ONE HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY 
HEAT SIX OF THE WOMEN'S ONE HUNDRED M. 
INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY AND GREAT 
BRITAIN'S HANNAH MILEY IS IN SEVEN 
WHAT A BRILLIANT FOUR HUNDRED M. SHE SWAM 
THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT SHORT 
FOR HER SHE IS GOING WELL ALREADY SHE IS GOING TO HAVE TO WORK THIS 
SECOND HALF 
YOU ARE RIGHT IT IS 
GOING TO BE TOUGH HANNAH MILEY MAKING A MOVE ON THE 
BREASTSTROKE THIS WAS A STRONG LEG 
FOR HER LAST NIGHT SHE IS COMING 
UP TO SECOND PLACE 
THIS IS EXACTLY 
WHAT SHE DID ENOUGH FOUR HUNDRED MEDLEY 
THERE ARE ALREADY ELEVEN SWIMMERS 
INSIDE HER LIFETIME BEST SHE 
SMASHED HER LIFETIME BEST IN THE 
FOUR HUNDRED MEDLEY THAT IS NOT BAD SHE WAS THIRD IN 
THAT HEAT THAT SHOULD GET HER 
THROUGH TO THE SEMI FINAL 
SHE WAS 
AT THE WRONG END OF THAT FINISH 
SHE WAS LYING NECK AND NECK FOR 
FIRST PLACE AND JUST MISSED IT BY A 
FEW HUNDREDTHS OF A SECOND PRETTY 
MUCH A QUALIFICATION FOR HER SHE 
WAS ONLY JUST PIPPED TO THIRD SHE SHE HAS DONE ENOUGH NINTH FASTEST FROM 
THE HEATS INTO THE SEMI FINALS 
HOW DO YOU CHANGE FROM DOING A FOUR HUNDRED 
TO THAT SPRINT THIS MORNING 
IT IS 
LIKE SPLASH L. HAVE DONE A FOUR HUNDRED AND 
OVER THE MOON NOW I AM HERE TO 
RELAX AND ENJOY IT 
WHAT DID HE DO 
LAST NIGHT DID YOU GET ANY SLEEP 
JUST IT WAS BIG HECTIC GETTING 
DRUG TESTED AND SEEING THE MEDIA 
IT DOES GIVE YOU AN EYE OPENER TO 
SEE WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE FOR THE 
OLYMPICS TO FIT IN YOUR OWN 
RECOVERY AND ALSO FITS IN DRUGS 
TESTING AND THE MEDIA 
I WAS 
WORKING IT OUT LAST NIGHT YOU ARE 
VERY LIGHT AND THESE GIRLS ARE 
TWICE YOUR SIZE 
I AM FIFTY ONE KILOS SO 
YES 
A LITTLE POWERHOUSE YES THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF HER 
SHE IS BRILLIANT NOW THE MEN'S FOUR HUNDRED 
INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY AND THOMAS HAD 
FAILED TO QUALIFY LAST WEEK FOR THE 
OLYMPICS WE WILL SEE HIM IN THIS 
HEAT FOR THE FOUR HUNDRED THOMAS HADFIELD HE GOES IN LANE 
FOUR THERE IS NOBODY IN LANE FIVE 
IT IS SCRATCHED MARTIN MENNOCK IN 
THREE WHAT A GREAT SWIM HE HAD AT THE 
OLYMPIC TRIALS TO MAKE THE OLYMPIC 
TEAM A LIFETIME BEST ALMOST OUT OF 
NO WORK 
THOMAS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 
THREE OR FOUR YEARS HE IS COACHED 
IN CARDIFF IT IS GOING TO BE 
INTERESTING FOR HIM L. CANNOT 
IMAGINE AFTER TWO LEARNS OF WHAT IS 
A SIXTEEN MEN'S RACE THAT THE AMERICAN 
IN LANE THREE WILL TROUBLE THOMAS 
AT ALL HE WILL HAVE TO SWIM HIS 
OWN EVENT LOOKING OVER TO THE SIDE 
HE IS NOT LOOKING OUT FOR THE OTHER 
SWIMMER AS MUCH AS IT LOOKS LIKE 
THAT IT IS THE BEST WAY HE FEELS 
HE CAN BREATHE 
HE DOES LOOK TO THE 
SIDE AND HIS IDEA WILL BE IT KEEPS 
HIS BODY A LITTLE BIT FLATTER HE 
DOES NOT HAVE TO LIFT HIS HEAD UP 
AS MUCH TO BREATHE HE HAS GOT TO 
WORK HARD IT IS A GOOD START SO 
FAR HE IS ABSOLUTELY ON HIS OWN 
SO IT IS PRETTY MUCH A TIME TRIAL 
HE DID NOT ENTER A QUALIFYING TIME 
SO ALL THOSE PEOPLE STARTING THE 
SLOWEST HEAT WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
A MISTAKE 
I THINK IT IS A HUGE 
MISTAKE IF YOU PLAY BY THE ROLLS 
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS L. WOULD HAVE 
JUST INVENTED A TIME 
HE WAS SIX IN 
THE COMMONWEALTH GAMES ARE IN A 
TWO HUNDRED M. BACKSTROKE HE HAS A MAESTRO 
NICE AND BALANCED LOOK HOW ARE 
STILL HIS HEAD IS HE WILL ROLL 
INTO THIS TURN OVER ON TO HIS 
STOMACH BEAUTIFULLY STREAMLINED 
UNDER WATER A GOOD DEMONSTRATION 
OF THE BACKSTROKE THE BRITISH 
RECORD SET BY ROBIN FRANCIS FOR 
STUMPY IS NOT GOING TO BE FAR OFF HE HAS A GREAT CHANCE OF BREAKING 
THE BRITISH RECORD HIS 
BREASTSTROKE IS PRETTY GOOD INTERESTINGLY HIS LIFETIME BEST IS 
FOUR MINUTES TWENTY ONE BUT AT THE TRIALS 
HE WENT FOUR MINUTES TWELVE IN THE LONG 
COURSE POOL ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN 
HERE 
THIS IS THE STORY OF A HERE SWIMMER IMPROVING ALL THE TIME HE 
HAS HAD A FANTASTIC TWELVE MONTHS 
DROPPING LIFETIME BESTS ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH HIS SHORT COURSE IS YET TO 
CATCH UP TO HIS LONG COURSE HIS 
BREASTSTROKE IS STRONG HE COMES 
OUT QUITE HIGH THERE ARE REAL 
VARIANCES IN STYLES IN THE 
BREASTSTROKE SOME WILL COME OUT 
VERY HIGH AND YOU WILL SEE THEIR 
SHOULDERS AT THE TOP OF THE CHEST 
BUT MOST SWIMMERS THESE MEN THAT 
WAY NOW SOME ASKED FLAT IN THE 
WATER MOST SWIMMERS DO SWIM THAT 
WAY NOW SOME OF FLAT IN THE WATER INTERESTINGLY THE GUY ABOVE HIM 
HE IS LAPPING HIM A BIT OF A RACE 
NOW THE LAST ONE HUNDRED M. HE IS FOUR SECONDS OF THE BRITISH 
RECORD HE WILL PROBABLY DO A 
LIFETIME BEST BUT A BRITISH RECORD 
FOUR MINUTES TEN WOULD BE A VERY 
GOOD HEAT AND SHOULD GET HIM INTO 
THE FINAL I WOULD SAY THOMAS HAD 
FILLED FROM CARDIFF WE HAVE NOT 
MENTIONED MUCH ABOUT HIS COACH 
DAVID HE HAS HAD FORTY FOUR OLYMPIANS OVER 
HIS TIME HE STARTED IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT HE 
HAS HAD SOME CRACKERS IN HIS TIME 
AND NOW THOMAS HIS LATEST CRACKER 
DAVID DAVIS HAS HAD MOST OF HIS 
TRAINING IN LOUGHBOROUGH DOWN THAT 
AS WELL HIS TIME REALLY IS GOOD THE REST 
OF THE GUYS WILL BE THINKING MY 
GOODNESS THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 
AS LOW HEAT BUT HE HAS BEATEN HIS 
LIFETIME BEST BY ELEVEN SECONDS YOU YOU HAD TO SET THE PACE FOR EVERYBODY 
ELSE HOW DIFFICULT IS THAT LAST LAST WEEK AT THE OLYMPIC TRIALS IN THE 
HEATS I SWAM OUT ON MY OWN AS WELL 
I QUITE LIKE SWIMMING ON MY OWN L. 
WILL NOT HAVE THE GREAT BIG WAVES 
COMING OF RYAN LOCHTE ARE SO I 
SUPPOSE THAT IS QUITE NICE I I EXPECT YOU 
WILL IN THE FINAL I I WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT 
IT IS 
NICE TO BE OUT HERE IN FRONT OF THE 
CROWD WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
YOUR COAT AND HIS CREDIBILITY OVER 
THE YEARS HE HAS BROUGHT HUGE 
EXPERIENCE TO YOU COACH 
YES L. 
HAVE BEEN SWIMMING IN A TWENTY FIVE METRES 
POOL FOR SEVEN YEARS L. COULD NOT 
BE IN BETTER HANDS 
YOU MUST BE 
VERY PLEASED WITH YOUR PROGRESS AT 
THE MOMENT 
LAST WEEK TO SEE FOUR 
MINUTES TWELVE I WAS COMPLETELY 
SHOCKED THIS MORNING THAT WAS O. K. 
FOR THIS MORNING L. DON'T KNOW L. 
WAS A BIT TIRED AFTER LAST WEEK IT 
IS HARD TO COME INTO THIS 
IS IT 
ABOUT CHASING THE BRITISH RECORD 
TONIGHT OR JUST ABOUT RACING LAST LAST WEEK WAS SO MUCH PRESSURE AND 
STRESS AT THIS ME THERE IS A NICE 
RELAXED ATMOSPHERE SO I WOULD LIKE 
TO HAVE FUN 
YOU HAVE A GREAT CROWD 
BEHIND YOU GOOD LUCK AMAZINGLY AMAZINGLY CASUAL ABOUT HIS TIME 
VERY WELSH 
CALM 
HE TAUGHT 
THAT THE PRESSURE CALM THAT THERE WAS AT THE OLYMPIC 
TRIALS TALKED ABOUT THERE IS 
HUGE PRESSURE THERE BUT THIS IS 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS WITH LESS 
PRESSURE WHICH 
IS INTERESTING HE HE IS ONLY TWENTY WHICH DOES HELP HE HAS 
THE MOST LAID BACK COACH AND HE 
TRANSMITS THAT TO THE ATHLETES 
THAT FINAL WILL BE THE FIRST THAT 
WE SHOW SEVEN FIFTEEN P. M. BOTH UP AGAINST 
RYAN LOCHTE 
IF THERE IS ONE PERSON 
THAT COULD STOP MICHAEL PHELPS 
WINNING EIGHT GOLD MEDALS IT IS 
RYAN LOCHTE SO WE ARE EXCITED 
ABOUT THAT 
WE ARE HAVING A LOOK AT 
HOW THE MEN'S TEAM ARE WORKING 
TOGETHER THESE ARE THE HEATS FOR 
THE MEN'S FOUR TIMES TWO HUNDRED M. GREAT 
BRITAIN ARE REMAIN FIVE ARE IN 
LANE FIVE 
DAVID CARRY HAS DONE A GOOD ONE AND 
NOW IT IS ANDREW HUNTER GREAT 
BRITAIN LEADING IN SECOND POSITION 
IN THAT WHITE HAT HE WAS IN THE 
ONE HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE RELAY LAST NIGHT ANOTHER GOOD LINE FOR THE BRITISH 
HERE AND BENEATH RECORD PACE A A FANTASTIC SWIM FOR THE MORNING 
DAVENPORT WILL HAVE TO BE UP FOR IT 
ON THE LAST LEG BECAUSE HE HAS RYAN 
LOCHTE UP AGAINST HIM RYAN LOCHTE 
HAS HAD A BIG PROGRAMME ALREADY 
TODAY AND HE IS SWIMMING IN A HUGE 
AMOUNT OF EVENTS HE WILL BE VERY 
WARMED UP THAT IS FOR SURE ANDREW HUNTER JUST CLOSING THE GAP I DO NOT THINK THE AMERICANS WILL 
HAVE TOO MANY SIMMERS FOR THE FINAL 
THE BRITISH WILL HAVE THE SAME FOUR 
GUYS THE AMERICANS MIGHT KEEP THE 
SAME DREAM THAT THAT WOULD BE 
UNUSUAL SAME TEAM BUT THAT 
WOULD BE UNUSUAL IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE 
AMERICANS ARE CATCHING UP RYAN 
LOCHTE IS ON THE LAST LEG FOR THE 
U. S. A. HE HAS HAD A VERY BUSY 
PROGRAMME BANISHING THEY DO NOT 
NEED TO SWIM AS MUCH AS THIS 
PUNISHING BUT THEY ARE GETTING HIM 
READY FOR THE OLYMPICS WHEN HE WILL 
HAVE TO SWIM A LOT A GOOD TAKEOVER 
FROM GREAT BRITAIN NOW GREAT BRITAIN LEADING IN THE LAST 
LEG OF THIS RAIN A DAVID CARRY 
ANDREW HUNTER ROSS DAVENPORT 
TAKING ON THE U. S. A. HEAD TO HEAD 
THIS RELAY ROSS DAVENPORT WON THE 
BRITISH OLYMPIC TRIALS HE LOOKS 
COMFORTABLE 
YES ROSS DAVENPORT COMFORTABLE HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AT THIS 
LEVEL NOW HE HAS WON GOLD MEDALS 
BEFORE SOPHIE IS ACTUALLY USING IT 
BACK HE HAS DONE VERY WELL HE 
IS ACTUALLY EASING IT BACK AT 
THE TOP OF THE PICTURE WE HAVE TWO TEAMS THAT ARE BEING LAPPED THIS IS FASCINATING RYAN LOCHTE IS THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER ON TWO HUNDRED M. 
BREASTSTROKE WE KNOW THAT HE CAN 
GO THE DISTANCE GREAT BRITAIN'S 
ROSS DAVENPORT IS A VERY GOOD TWO HUNDRED M. 
FREESTYLE SWIMMER BRITISH RECORD 
HOLDER AND THIS IS FASCINATING 
LOOK AT THIS WE HAVE SEEN RYAN 
LOCHTE AS SWIMMING THE ONE HUNDRED M. 
BREASTSTROKE HERE WHICH HE HAS 
NEVER DONE BEFORE AT MAJOR WORLD 
MEET HE HAS NOT DONE THE BACK 
STRAIGHT SO FAR NOW HE IS DOING 
TWO HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE AFTER THE FIFTY M. 
FREESTYLE WITH TWO LEGS TO GO 
GREAT BRITAIN ARE LEADING IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE HAVING A 
VERY GOOD BATTLE VERY USEFUL FOR 
THE OLYMPICS 
AND THEY HAVE A GREAT 
CROWD HUNDREDS OF SCREAMING 
SCHOOLCHILDREN RYAN LOCHTE JUST 
DOES NOT WANT TO LOSE THIS HE 
KICKED OFF THE WALL REALLY STRONGLY A VERY GOOD SWIM IN THE FROM THE U. S. A. GREAT BRITAIN GET SECOND THEY MISSED THE BRITISH RECORD BY 
NINE ONE HUNDREDTHS OF A SECOND 
THAT IS O. K. FOR A HEAT SWIM IT IS 
GOOD TO SEE THEM SWIMMING FAST IN 
THE HEATS BUT WHAT DID RYAN LOCHTE 
DO IN HIS LAST TURN 
HE IS 
TURBOCHARGED ROSS DAVENPORT COMES 
IN FIRST THAT THAT THAT MASSIVE 
FLY KICK UNDERNEATH THE WATERED 
ROSS DAVENPORT MUST HAVE THOUGHT 
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE CLEAR 
WATER BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM RYAN LOCHTE IS A MASTER VERY VERY 
STRONG LAPPING THOSE GUYS 
SHOWBOATING ON THAT TURN 
I THINK 
IT WAS L. THINK YOU DID IT IN YOUR TIME I WISH I WAS THAT GOOD THE AMERICA QUALIFIES 
FASTEST FOR THE FINAL GREAT BRITAIN IN SECOND GREAT BRITAIN QUALIFY IN SECOND FASTEST FOR THE MEN'S FOUR TIMES 
TWO HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE FINAL 
THAT FINAL WILL BE ON B. B. C. 
INTERACTIVE TONIGHT WE HAVE 
COVERAGE ON B. B. C. TWO FROM SEVEN O'CLOCK 
UNTIL EIGHT O'CLOCK THAT IS WHEN WE 
SWITCH TO THE RED BUTTON TO BRING 
YOU EVERYTHING ELSE ON OFFER LOTS 
OF GOLD MEDALS UP FOR GRABS A BUSY 
WEEKEND FOR BRITISH SPORT 
IMMACULATE FAIRWAYS PERFECT GREENS BREATHTAKING GOLF IT FOR ONCE THE GRASS REALLY IS 
GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE THE 
WORLD'S BEST PLAYERS ON THE WORLD'S 
MOST BEAUTIFUL CHORDS THE MASTERS 
FROM AUGUSTA TONIGHT AT NINE O'CLOCK 
ON B. B. C. TWO MASSES COMING UP JUST THINKING 
ABOUT IT COVERAGE FOR THE U. S. 
MASTERS HAS JUST STARTED ON B. B. C. 
INTERACTIVE LET'S GO THROUGH THE 
SCHEDULE OF EVENTS TONIGHT YOU CAN 
PICK FOR ME WHERE THE MEDALS ARE 
BUT AT THE FINALS FOUR HUNDRED M. 
I THINK HE 
HAS QUALIFIED SECOND FASTEST RYAN 
LOCHTE WAS BASICALLY DAWDLING BUT 
IF YOU TAKE HIM OUT OF THE EQUATION 
THE MEDAL IS UP FOR GRABS HE WAS 
DISSATISFIED WITH HIS ELEVEN SECONDS 
PERSONAL BEST THIS MORNING SO I 
EXPECT HE WILL BE BETTER 
KATE A 
WORD WHAT ABOUT LIAM TANCOCK 
KATE HEYWOOD 
I THINK HE WILL 
STRUGGLE 
A VERY BUSY EVENING FOR FRANCESCA 
HALSALL 
SHE MIGHT BREAK TWO HALSALL BARRIERS THE TWENTY SIX SECOND BARRIER IN 
THE FIFTY BUTTERFLY 
I THINK ELIZABETH 
SIMMONDS HAS A VERY GOOD CHANCE AT 
BACKSTROKE IN WITH A SHOUT FOR A 
MEDAL 
HANNAH MILEY BACK IN THE POOL FOR 
HER SECOND 
A TOUGH CALL FOR HER 
THE DISTANCE IS JUST TOO SHORT 
JOANNE JACKSON SWAM REALLY WELL IN 
THAT RELAY AND REBECCA ADLINGTON IS 
IN THE FORM OF HER LIFE THEY COULD 
HAVE A GREAT CHANCE FOR GOLD MEDAL 
REBECCA ADLINGTON IS ALWAYS YOU 
SWIMMER OF THE WEEK SO FAR 
I THINK 
SO 
ALMOST 
VERY EXCITED ABOUT SO THAT 
AND BECAUSE MANCHESTER UNITED THAT END UP PLAYING AT HOME TONIGHT WE 
SHOULD GET A BIGGER CROWD 
WE DID 
NOT DO TOO BADLY 
THERE IS NEVER 
ANYTHING BETTER THAN SWIMMING IN 
FRONT OF YOUR HOME CROWD 
I NEVER 
HAD THAT AT A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL 
WE WILL BE BACK AT SEVEN O'CLOCK ON B. B. C. 
TWO GOODBYE 
THE TARGETS CHANGE THE TERROR DOES NOT 
THE BLOODY HISTORY OF FORTY YEARS OF TERRORISM
