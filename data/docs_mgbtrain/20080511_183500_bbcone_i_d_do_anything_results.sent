DESPITE FAKE 
BOTTOM OLS AND FAKE PUNCHES CAN 
THE GIRLS PULL OFF A CONADVICING 
PERFORMANCE I AM LOOKING LOOKING 
FOR EMOTION WHEN THEY COME INTO THE 
SCENE AND THEY CARRY THE EMOTION ON 
UNTIL THEY HAVE LEFT AND GONE OUT 
THE DOOR

ONE STEP AHEAD ON HER CUES JESSIE JESSIE PANICS 
RACHEL AND ASHLEY WERE VERY PANICS CONVINCING 
NIAMH WAS HELD BACK SLIGHTLY NIAMH NIAMH MISSED WITH THE BOTTLE BUT INSTEAD 
OF FALTERING AND GOING OH MY 
GOODNESS SHE CONTINUED AND 
FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH IT 
SHE HAD 
ME BACKING OUT 
SHE IS A BIT 
AGGRESSIVE THAT IS THE DIFFERENT 
SIDE OF NIAMH WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS TO KEEP 
THE ACTING UNTIL YOU WENT OUT OF 
THE ROOM 
JODIE MADE ME LAUGH THE 
MOMENT SHE HIT ME WITH THE BOTTLE 
SHE WAS SO WORRIED SHE HAD HURT ME 
SHE SAID ARE YOU ALL RIGHT
