FRIENDLY FACE OF THE CHILDREN'S ART 
SHOW SMART LAST YEAR OUT WITH HIS 
CHILDHOOD FRIEND AND HIS FIANCEE 
NATASHA COLLINS

SCALDING WATER AFTER TAKING DRUGS

THIS MAN NEEDS TO BE FOUND QUICKLY 
A KILLER WHO SCRAWLED A MURDER 
CONFESSION ON A DOOR AT A REMAND 
CENTRE HAS BEEN JAILED FOR TWELVE YEARS 
DANIELLE JOHNSON WAS SEVENTEEN WHEN SHE 
WAS STABBED AND BEATEN SO BADLY BY 
HER EX BOYFRIEND THAT HER MOTHER 
COULD NOT RECOGNISE HER MARC KING 
BROMLEY WAS JAILED FOR HER MURDER 
WHICH HAPPENED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN

LORRY DRIVERS AND HAULAGE COMPANIES 
HAVE BEEN FINED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SINCE THE 
CAPITAL WIDE LOW EMISSIONS ZONE WAS 
INTRODUCED IN FEBRUARY IF 
TRANSPORT FOR LONDON SAYS OVER FIVE HUNDRED 
FAILED TO MEET THE 
EMISSION STANDARDS 
THERE ARE SIGNS THAT THE TIGHTENING 
UP OF LOANS IN THE HOUSING MARKET 
IS STARTING TO HIT THE PRICE OF 
PROPERTY EVEN IN LONDON AND THE 
HOME COUNTIES NO ONE CAN PREDICT 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT FEW 
MONTHS BUT WITH THE POWER SHIFTING 
FROM CELLAR TO BUYER MANY ARE 
STRUGGLING TO SELL THEIR HOMES 
EARTH EARTH SAID ALBANS ONE OF THE MOST SOUGHT 
AFTER PLACES TO LIVE IN THE SOUTH 
EAST SAINT ALBANS ONCE BUYERS WERE 
FIGHTING OVER COTTAGERS BUT ALL IS 
NOT WELL INSIDE THE HISTORIC WALLS 
CHRISTINA MADDEN HAS HAD HER PROPER 
TO MARKET FOR SIX MONTHS AND EVEN 
DROPPING THE PRICE BY FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOWN 
TO FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND HAS MADE NO DIFFERENCE 
SHE THINKS GORDON BROWN SHOULD BE 
DOING MORE TO HELP 
I THINK HE 
SHOULD HAVE ABOLISHED STAMP DUTY 
FOR FIRST TIME BUYERS THAT WOULD 
HAVE GOT THE FIRST TIME BUYERS INTO 
THE MARKET THEY WOULD PUSH THE 
OTHER PEOPLE FORWARD AND IT WOULD 
HAVE HELPED EVERYBODY 
SAINT ALBANS 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN POPULAR WITH HOUSE 
BUYERS BUT ESTATE AGENTS ARE 
ADVISING CLIENTS TO BE REALISTIC 
ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE 
MARKET AND BELIEVE THAT MANY NOW 
ACCEPT THINGS COULD GET WORSE THEY THEY ARE LISTENING TO WHAT IS HAPPENING 
IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND 
BEGINNING TO REALISE THAT PERHAPS 
THEY SHOULD COME TO THE MARKET NOW 
RATHER THAN WAIT UNTIL THE SUMMER 
WHEN PRICES MAY BE AFFECTED MORE BY 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
SOME REPORTS 
SUGGEST THAT IN LONDON THINGS ARE 
HOLDING UP A LITTLE BETTER BUT 
THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF 
CEZANNE AND PETER FROM MUSWELL HILL 
WHO ARE STILL WAITING FOR AN OFFER 
ON THEIR PROPERTY AFTER SIX MONTHS 
WE DO FEEL WE HAVE MISSED THE BOAT 
IF WE HAD PUT THE HOUSE ON THE 
MARKET THIS TIME LAST YEAR IT 
WOULD HAVE FLOWN OUT THE DOOR THEY THEY WERE GOING IN A WEEK 
THERE WILL 
ALWAYS BE SOME HOUSES THAT WILL 
SELL MORE EASILY THAN OTHERS BUT 
AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF GROWTH 
DROPPING THE PRICE OF YOUR HOUSE IS 
NEVER GOING TO BE EASY
