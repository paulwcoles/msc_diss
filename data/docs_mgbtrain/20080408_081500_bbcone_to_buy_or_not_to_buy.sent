DOMINIC HEADPHONES ON I THINK WE'LL BE TRIPPING THE LIGHT FANTASTIC YOU THINK SO YES O. K. 
IT'S REALLY NICE ACTUALLY ISN'T IT YES 
WITH THE WINDOW 
IT'S COS EVERYTHING'S PAINTED IN CREAM A LOT OF SPACE 
OH GOSH STUDY YEAH 
NICE AND LIGHT YES SMALLISH I SUPPOSE IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY ROOMS WE'VE GOT DOWNSTAIRS YEAH 
YOU'RE GREETED BY THIS GREAT STAIRCASE ALL THE DOORS GOING OFF 
OH LIVING ROOM 
IT'S SMALL YES IT'S SMALLER THAN I'D HAVE HOPED FOR REALLY 
A THREE AND A TWO I SUPPOSE YOU COULD PROBABLY

YOU'D PROBABLY GET TWO THREE SEATERS IN HERE YEAH 
AH OH SETTEES SOFAS THERE YOU GO 
DINING ROOM SMASH IT THROUGH TO MAKE ONE BIG ROOM YOU COULD DO 
THEY MIGHT THINK THAT ROOM'S SMALL 
BUT WHAT THEY'VE GOT DOWNSTAIRS IS THREE RECEPTION ROOMS 
THAT IS SO GENEROUS 
WHAT'S THIS UTILITY 
OH RIGHT DOES THAT DOOR GO YOU MUST BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THERE 
THERE'S TOO MANY DOORS IN THAT UTILITY ROOM I AGREE 
IT'S LIKE THAT AMERICAN BAND THE DOORS 
THE KITCHEN THAT'S NICE 
DOES THIS SEEM DARK IT'S GOT A SMALL WINDOW HASN'T IT YES 
I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S DARK IN THERE IT'S NOT DARK IT'S BEECH WOOD WITH LIGHT TILES AND LIGHT WALLS 
HOW IS THAT DARK HE NEEDS TO TAKE HIS SUNGLASSES OFF 
HELLO NEIGHBOURS 
WE'RE OVERLOOKED 
OH COME ON IT'S A NEW HOUSING ESTATE OVERLOOKED BY EVERYBODY 
IT'S QUITE WIDE YES IT IS AND I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SCREEN THAT 
COULDN'T YOU FOOTBALL NET IN THE CORNER 
OH HE'S A BIRMINGHAM CITY FAN IS HE OH DO WE HOLD THAT AGAINST HIM 
WELL THAT'S IDEAL 
COS YOU COULD SECTION THAT ONE OFF AND HAVE THAT AS A STORE YES 
JUST TURN THE WHOLE GARAGE INTO A BIG DELUXE OFFICE YEAH 
THAT'D BE IDEAL TO WORK FROM YEAH 
BRILLIANT WOULDN'T TAKE MUCH TO DO EITHER NO NO 
THE REASON I THINK THIS HOUSE IS PERFECT 
IS BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE THE HOUSE SEPARATE FROM THE BUSINESS PREMISES 
TOTALLY IT WORKS REALLY NICELY 
A LITTLE BIT SMALL BUT WE COULD SCREEN OFF THERE 
BUT I DEFINITELY THEY'VE GOT QUITE A FEW TREES IN ALREADY 
I THINK WE COULD PUT UP WITH THIS 
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I JUST HEARD THERE WHAT 
WE COULD PUT UP WITH THIS 
OH WOW I LIKE THAT 
OH I CAN SEE ME GLIDING DOWN HERE IN MY BALL GOWN 
I LOVE THAT STAIRCASE THE WAY IT SPLITS OFF LEFT AND RIGHT 
IT REMINDS ME OF DYNASTY AND DALLAS GONE WITH THE WIND RIGHT 
ONE OF THE BEDROOMS THIS OBVIOUSLY WOULDN'T BE THE MASTER BEDROOM THERE'S ONLY A SINGLE IN IT 
THAT IS A DOUBLE BEDROOM ACTUALLY IF SHE WANTS TO BE PRECISE THAT IS A DOUBLE BEDROOM 
THAT'S A BONUS THE BUILT IN WARDROBES COS YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET MORE FURNITURE WHEN THE ROOM'S SMALL 
THERE'S BUILT IN WARDROBES IN EVERY ROOM 
OBVIOUSLY NOT THE MASTER BUT IT'S GOT A SMALL EN SUITE 
OH AND WARDROBES HERE AS WELL 
SHE IS WON OVER BY THE WARDROBES I THINK 
THAT'S A WOMAN FOR YOU STORAGE 
A SHOWER LOO AND BASIN THAT'S REALLY NICE 
THERE'S THREE LAVVIES UPSTAIRS ONE DOWNSTAIRS FOUR LAVVIES THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY 
IF YOU PUT THE DOUBLE BED IN THAT WAY YOU COULDN'T OPEN THE DOOR NO 
YOU'D ONLY GET A SINGLE BED IN HERE 
NO THAT IS A DOUBLE BEDROOM 
THIS IS THE MASTER IS IT THE MASTER BEDROOM 
THAT'S NICE THEY'RE VERY NEUTRAL 
THE WHOLE HOUSE IS NEUTRAL IT'S ALL JUST PAINTED IN THAT PEACHY COLOUR 
IT'S SMALL AGAIN ISN'T IT YEAH 
DOM I'M BEING HARPOONED YEAH 
YEAH I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT ACTUALLY 
PLENTY OF ROOM FOR ALL YOUR STUFF YEAH DO I GET ANY OF IT 
IN THAT MASTER BEDROOM THERE ARE THREE SETS OF WARDROBES 
SO A WARDROBE FOR HIM A WARDROBE FOR HER AND A WARDROBE FOR 
HER SHOES HER SHOES YES YES 
THEY'VE GOT THREE WARDROBES AND THEN THEY'VE PUT THE SINK BEHIND THE DOOR 
MOST SINKS ARE BEHIND THE DOOR WELL THE THING IS 
YOU GO IN CLOSE THE DOOR GO TO THE TOILET WASH THE HANDS THEN OPEN THE DOOR AGAIN 
SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM 
WELL I THINK IT'D ONE PERSON AT A TIME YES 
YOU HAVE FALLEN FLAT ON YOUR FACE 
I FEEL THE GRAZES AND I FEEL THE BRUISES 
OH ANOTHER ROOM NO IT'S THE AIRING CUPBOARD

JOHN YOU WERE FLATTER THAN A PANCAKE ABOUT THIS HOUSE 
OH YOU WERE DON'T GO OH YOU KNOW YOU WERE 
WELL 
YOU KNOW SMALL 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM EVERYTHING'S SMALL 
THE THING IS I DON'T QUITE AGREE WITH YOU IT'S A CONFUSING HOUSE 
IT'S BEEN BUILT BY A VERY GOOD BUILDER SOMETHING UNUSUAL AND YOU HAVEN'T COMMENTED ON IT 
NINE FOOT HIGH CEILINGS WHEN HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THAT IN A NEW BUILD 
THAT'S TRUE THEY ARE HIGH AND YOU'VE GOT A BIG HALLWAY 
AND UPSTAIRS A HUGE LANDING YOU COULD LAND A HELICOPTER UP THERE WE'VE GOT A BIG HALL 
BIG LANDING SMALL ROOMS 
I'M NOT SELLING IT TO YOU AM I NO DOM 
I CAN'T HELP FEELING THAT THE ONLY THING YOU LIKE ABOUT THIS HOUSE 
IS THAT PORCH 
A. N. N. CAN I SAY THAT AS A PERSON I REALLY LIKE YOU THANK YOU 
UNTIL YOU WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR I CHANGED MY MIND WHY WAS THAT 
WHY WAS THAT HORRIBLE I DON'T KNOW WHO I WAS LISTENING TO OBVIOUSLY JOHN OBVIOUSLY JOHN

NUMBER TWO DOMINIC'S CHOICE COME ON NOW WE'LL TURN THE GAS UP 
JOHN AND A. N. N. MIGHT BE INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT THE BUILDERS ARE STILL PLANTING THE COMMUNAL AREAS HERE 
BUT IT'D BE WORTH CHECKING OUT WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS UPKEEP 
AS THE PROPERTY IS UNDER TEN YEARS O. L. D. 
THEIR SOLICITOR MUST REQUEST A COPY OF THE NHBC CERTIFICATE 
WHICH GUARANTEES THE STRUCTURE 
PROPERTY TWO IS MY CHOICE IT'S IN THE VILLAGE OF BROOM 
MY GIRLFRIEND'S FAVOURITE MODE OF TRANSPORT SEVEN MILES FROM STRATFORD WONDERFUL VIEWS 
PLENTY OF ROOM AND LET'S NOT FORGET THE BUSINESS 
LOTS OF DRIVEWAY AND A NICE BIG DOUBLE GARAGE 
NOW WE'RE TALKING THIS IS THE PROPERTY I'VE CHOSEN AS MY FAVOURITE 
A BIT LIKE KRISTIAN'S 
IT'S A NEW BUILD BUT IT'S EIGHT YEARS OLD 
SO IT'S GOT THAT SORT OF SETTLED IN MORE HOMELY FEEL

THEY HAVEN'T GOT WHY THIS IS THE WILD CARD 
THEY HAVEN'T REALISED WHY WE'VE PICKED THIS ONE 
DOES EVERYTHING SEEM ADDED ON YEAH I THINK IT PROBABLY IS 
NOTHING SEEMS TO FLOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT ON HERE A LITTLE BIT ADDED THERE A LITTLE BIT PUSHED ON HERE 
IT IS BUT THAT'S THE WAY THE HOUSE WAS BUILT 
THROUGH TO NEXT DOOR IS THIS

YOU GET THEM A HUGE AREA AND THEY KNOCK IT 
DOM COULD LIVE UP HERE HE'D LIKE IT 
A DOM SIZE HOUSE 
I TELL YOU WHAT 
I STILL DON'T IT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE IS IT 
IT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE WHAT DOES HE MEAN 
IT'S RIGHT HERE IT'S ALL BRICKS AND FOUNDATIONS IT'S NOT THERE IS IT IT'S HERE 
IT WOULDN'T BE PRACTICAL AT ALL ALL THE STUFF WE NEED HAS TO BE ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
THE POLICE ARE COMING TO ARREST THEM FOR BEING SO NEGATIVE 
THAT'S A CRIME ON TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
THE SIRENS ARE THE FASHION POLICE 
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY 
MORE STAIRS MORE STAIRS 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT'S UP HERE 
MORE WALLS MORE BEDROOMS MORE SPACE MORE BATHROOMS MORE EVERYTHING 
BIT MORE EMOTION'S WHAT WE NEED YES

OH HERE WE ARE BACK ON THE WARDROBES 
THEY ARE ON A GIANT PROPERTY HAMSTER WHEEL

GIANT PROPERTY HAMSTER WHEEL YEAH 
OH THE BATHROOM'S A BIT BIGGER I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A WHITE ONE 
I DON'T LIKE THAT COLOUR 
I WOULD AGREE WITH HER THERE THE COLOURS ARE A BIT DATED 
BUT IT'S NOT AN EXPENSIVE ITEM NO BATHROOM'S ARE SO CHEAP THESE DAYS 
NICE VIEW OVER THE BACK OF THE THE COWSHED THE COWSHED 
YOU CAN HAVE AN ART CRITIC A RESTAURANT CRITIC A THEATRE CRITIC

THAT'S TWO PLUS POINTS THEN 
KRIS LET'S GET IN THERE AND LIFT THEIR SPIRITS WE CAN LIVEN IT UP 
HERE YOU ARE JOHN

BUT YOU DIDN'T REALISE THIS WAS AT THE BACK OF IT ARE YOU TRYING TO SELL ME THAT I TELL YOU WHAT

IT'S ALL GOING WRONG ISN'T IT IT IS 
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO PROVE TO YOU THAT THIS IS PERFECT 
YOU'LL HAVE TO CONVINCE ME KRIS RIGHT I'M SPRINGING INTO ACTION 
LET'S THINK ABOUT IT YOU'VE GOT ACCESS OFF THE STREET 
YOU COME IN HERE YOU CAN HAVE SOME STORAGE DOWN HERE 
BUT YOUR MAIN OFFICE SPACE WOULD BE UPSTAIRS WHERE YOU CAN WORK TOGETHER IN SWEET HARMONY BEAUTIFUL 
BEAUTIFUL STUFF DO YOU HAVE CLIENTS COME TO THE HOUSE OCCASIONALLY 
SO YOU'RE DRAGGING THEM IN TO YOUR CONVERTED GARAGE HOW SOPHISTICATED 
HAVE A SOFA DOWN HERE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CATALOGUES 
AND ALL THAT FANCY PAPERWORK RIGHT 
YOU CAN POP INTO YOUR BUSINESS KITCHEN MAKE THEM CUPS OF TEA WOO THEM INTO BUYING YOUR PRODUCTS 
AND THEN IN THE BATHROOM ALL THE CONVENIENCES AFTER THEY'VE DRUNK MY TEA 
AFTER THEY'VE DRUNK YOUR TEA YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE COMPANY HERE IT'S MUCH MORE POLISHED 
THAN WORKING OUT OF A GARAGE THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IS GOOD I SUPPOSE SO NOT ANY SUPPOSING O. K. 
THIS IS A GIFT FRANKLY 
LISTEN DON'T DISS EVERYTHING THINK ABOUT IT A BIT LONGER AND HARDER 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PRICE THEN CONSIDER ALL THREE PROPERTIES 
THEN MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION O. K. FAIR ENOUGH YES A. N. N. WITH ME 
IF YOU HAVE ANXIETIES ABOUT RUNNING A BUSINESS FROM HOME 
SPEAK TO YOUR LOCAL COUNCIL FIRST 
OH GUESS THE PRICE TIME HOW DID YOU GET ON WITH THE ANNEXE

CAN'T WAIT TO GET DOWN THERE FOR THEM STICKLEBACKS OH 
GUESS THE PRICE TIME AT THE MOMENT IT'S NECK AND NECK ISN'T IT

I THINK JOHN WE'LL ASK YOU TO GO FIRST O. K. 
HOW MUCH DO YOU RECKON THIS HOUSE IS WELL 
WE'VE TENDED TO ROUND UP OUR PRICES 
I THINK

THAT'S GOOD A VERY PRECISE GUESS 
IT WAS VERY PRECISE IT'S ALL GOT VERY COMPETITIVE 
I'M GONNA STILL ROUND UP GO ON BECAUSE THAT'S EASIER WITH SUMS

IT'S SENSATIONAL WELL DONE SHAKE SHAKE THE MAN'S HAND SORRY 
WELL DONE DEAR 
I HAVE TO ADMIT DEFEAT 
NOW LISTEN I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A MORE SERIOUS TONE HERE 
WE'VE NOW SEEN ALL THREE PROPERTIES IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING JOURNEY IT HAS 
TIME TO DECIDE WHICH PROPERTY YOU WANT TO TEST DRIVE OR TRY BEFORE YOU BUY 
WE'VE PUT THE DETAILS OF ALL THREE PROPERTIES ON THIS LAPTOP 
WHO IS MORE IT SWITCHED ON 
THERE YOU GO STUDY IT AT YOUR OWN LEISURE 
KRIS AND I WILL FIND OUT LATER WHICH ONE YOU'VE CHOSEN O. K. OFF THAT WAY 
BYE BYE OH YOU GAVE ME A HUG BYE BYE 
WHILE THEY STUDY THE LAPTOP OF THE THREE PROPERTIES 
WILL IT BE MY CHOICE PROPERTY ONE 
A FANTASTIC DOUBLE FRONTED FOUR BEDROOM DETACHED HOUSE 
IN STRATFORD AND A DOUBLE GARAGE AND THAT WONDERFUL STAIRCASE 
NO CHANCE THEY'LL CHOOSE MY WELL PROPORTIONED FOUR BEDDER 
IN BROOM WITH VIEWS OF THE RIVER A LOVELY GARAGE AND A COUNTRYSIDE LOCATION 
YOU COULD BE OVER CONFIDENT BECAUSE THERE IS THE WILD CARD 
ANOTHER RIVER LOCATION THIS TIME IN HENLEY FOUR BEDROOMS 
AND AN ANNEXE FOR THE BUSINESS 
PROPERTY NUMBER ONE I LIKED THAT ONE ON THE OUTSIDE 
WITH THE DETAILING ON THE WINDOWS IT WAS DECEPTIVE WHEN YOU WENT IN 
COS IT WAS A LOVELY HALLWAY IT WAS FUNNY LAYOUT DOWNSTAIRS 
YOU HAD THE KITCHEN UTILITY AND THE DINING ROOM NEEDED MORE ROOM ALL OVER 
HMM 
THE KITCHEN'S BRIGHT YES THE KITCHEN WAS O. K. 
THE BEDROOMS AGAIN WERE SMALL 
WE'D HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT CONVERTING THE GARAGE AS WELL ON THAT ONE YES 
PROPERTY NUMBER THREE 
THAT FRONTAGE NOW LOOKING AT THAT LIKE THAT IT LOOKS MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THE OTHER ONES 
YOU'VE GOT THE OFFICE SET UP ALREADY YEAH YOU COULD MOVE STRAIGHT IN AND START WORK 
WHICH ONE SHOULD WE GO FOR 
I RECKON WE'RE BOTH OF THE SAME MIND I THINK WE'LL GO FOR 
WELL TALK ABOUT A U. TURN 
WE LEAVE YOU ALONE WITH A LAPTOP 
AND YOU GO FOR THE WILD CARD WELL 
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND 
WE THOUGHT WE'LL GIVE THIS A TRY BECAUSE THE OFFICE SETUP WOULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GIVE IT A GO 
BEFORE YOU GO IN FOR THE TEST DRIVE 
THE TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY SURVEYOR HAS GIVEN THIS HOUSE A THOROUGH GOING OVER 
BUT WE MUST POINT OUT IT'S NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY 
IF YOU WANT TO BUY THE HOUSE GET AN INDEPENDENT ONE DONE 
THE EXTENSION HAS BEEN DONE THERE IS NO LEAD FLASHING AS IT JOINS THE PROPERTY 
WHILE ON THE OTHER SIDE 
CAN YOU SEE THE LEAD FLASHING 
OH YES THERE'S NO SIGNS OF DAMP IN THE PROPERTY BUT YOU'D NEED TO GET FLASHING PUT ON 
AND YOU HAVE TO GET AN AGREEMENT WITH YOUR NEIGHBOURS 
LOOK AT THE JOINT THERE'S A GAP 
IT GOES INTO A POINT BUT THERE'S ROOM THERE FOR VERMIN WASPS BEES ANYTHING MAKING IT THEIR HOME 
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT AN ISSUE LIKE THAT CROPPING UP SO IDEALLY YOU NEED TO SEAL IT UP 
YOU CAN DO IT WITH CEMENT A FACIA BOARD IT'LL ONLY COST A COUPLE OF QUID BUT IT'LL SAVE PROBLEMS 
YES O. K. THAT'S ALL 
NOW GO AND DO YOUR TEST DRIVE WE'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE 
HAVE FUN TREAT IT LIKE YOUR OWN 
WHICH IS A WORRY SHALL WE DISAPPEAR 
LOOK AT A. N. N. TREATING THE PLACE LIKE ITS HER OWN 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT A LOT OF ROOM NO 
ANYBODY WANT SOME TOAST 
I'LL TAKE A CHAIR WHICH COULD SIMULATE A BOX 
O. K. PROBABLY A BIT LIGHTER THAN A BOX YES 
IT IS AWKWARD 
YES VERY AWKWARD GETTING DOWN HERE 
MIND HOW YOU GO YOU COULD JUST DROP IT FROM THE TOP 
NO WE'D NEED A CONVEYOR BELT 
A LITTLE SPLOSH FOR YOU THERE LOVELY THANK YOU 
IT'S QUITE NICE SITTING OUT HERE ISN'T IT IN THE SUNSHINE YEAH 
THE SUN IN THE OLD MINCE PIES 
THE KIDS SEEM TO LOVE THE GARDEN 
BUT WILL THEY SWING THEIR MUM AND DAD'S OPINION 
A. N. N. AND JOHN HOUSE HUNTING HAS NEVER BEEN SO MUCH FUN OR CRAZY 
THIS IS TRUE THAN WITH YOU TWO YOU'VE SPENT SOME TIME IN THIS PROPERTY 
WHAT'S IT BEEN LIKE WE HAD A FEW DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE COULD WORK OUT WITH THE ANNEXE 
AND IT'S QUITE INTERESTING DIFFERENT TO THE SETUP WE'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT 
ARE YOU GOING TO BARTER FOR THIS HOUSE OR SCARPER 
WE'RE GOING TO SCARPER I'M AFRAID SO 
GOT TO BE HONEST I'M NOT SURPRISED NOT A COMPLETE REVELATION 
BUT WE WERE HOPING THE TEST DRIVE MIGHT'VE CHANGED YOUR MINDS A BIT 
WE GAVE IT A GO AND WE'VE IT'S GIVEN US A FEW IDEAS FOR WHAT WE CAN MAYBE DO 
AND MAYBE OTHER PROPERTIES THAT WE CAN BE LOOKING AT 
WE'LL SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN LOVELY HAPPY HOUSE HUNTING THANKS VERY MUCH BYE BYE BYE 
KRIS LET'S FACE FACTS THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A YEAR THEMSELVES 
BUT I BET THEY'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH UNUSUAL PROPERTIES ONES THEY'D NEVER HAVE LOOKED AT 
YOU'RE RIGHT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BUY ANY OF THE PROPERTIES 
IT WILL HAVE HELPED THEM HONE IN THEIR SEARCH WE'VE GIVEN THEM NEW FRESH PROPERTY IDEAS 
I FEEL HONOURED I FEEL PROUD 
DO YOU YEAH HONOURED AND PROUD EH 
IF ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE WOULD LIKE KRIS AND I TO HELP THEM FIND THEIR DREAM HOME THEN GET IN TOUCH 
MAYBE NEXT TIME DOMINIC AND I WILL BE FINDING YOUR DREAM HOME 
THEY TALKED ABOUT IT THEN WENT COLD AT THE END LET'S 
LET'S GET OUR LINES OUT SHALL WE

HOW MANY BEDROOMS TWELVE 
I'M JUST BEING FILMED CAN I CALL YOU BACK
