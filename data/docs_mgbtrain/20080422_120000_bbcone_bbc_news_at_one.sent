BRITAIN'S SECOND BIGGEST BANK THE 
ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND ASKS ITS 
SHAREHOLDERS FOR BILLIONS OF POUNDS 
TO BOLSTER ITS FINANCES POLICE 
SEARCHING FOR A MOTHER AND HER 
DISABLED SON HAVE FOUND A BODY 
THEY BELIEVE IT'S HEATHER WARDLE 
WHO DISAPPEARED ON FRIDAY TYING 
THE KNOT WHERE YOU WANT NEW RULES 
TO ALLOW MORE COUPLES TO EXCHANGE 
VOWS IN CHURCH 
AND LATER ON LONDON NOISY PROTEST 
HUNDREDS FIGHT PLANS TO CHANGE 
FLIGHT PATHS NORTH OF LONDON AND 
CALLING TIME ON THE CAPITAL'S PUBS 
HAVE OUR OLD FASHIONED BOOZERS 
HAD THEIR DAY 
GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO THE 
B. B. C. NEWS AT ONE BRITAIN'S MAIN 
AIRPORT OPERATOR B. A. A. MAY HAVE TO 
SELL ONE OF ITS SITES AFTER SOME 
DAMNING CRITICISM FROM THE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION B. A. A. OWNS 
SEVEN AIRPORTS IN THE U. K. INCLUDING 
HEATHROW GATWICK AND STANSTED BUT 
THE COMMISSION SAID IT MAY NOT BE 
SERVING WELL THE INTERESTS OF 
EITHER AIRLINES OR PASSENGERS AND 
THIS MORNING THE TRANSPORT 
SECRETARY RUTH KELLY ORDERED A 
REVIEW OF THE WAY BRITAIN'S 
AIRPORTS ARE REGULATED TOM SYMONDS 
IS AT GATWICK AIRPORT YES IT IS 
PSSIBLE THAT LATER THIS YEAR THIS 
AIRPORT MAY BE SOLD OFF BY B. A. A. IT 
IS ONE OPTION BEING CONSIDERED BY 
THE COMPETITION COMMISSION TODAY 
THE COMMISSION INDICATED IT WAS 
KEEN ON SHAKING UP THE WHOLE WAY IN 
WHICH OUR AIRPORTS ARE BEING 
MANAGED RUNNING AN AIRPORT 
PASSENGER NUMBERS ARE GROWING AND 
SECURITY TIGHTENING AIRLINE 
ATTITUDES HARDENING THE VIEW IS 
THAT B. A. A. IS NOT COPING THE 
TERMINAL FIVE FIASCO SAID IT ALL IN 
ONE DAY SO MUCH OPTIMISM WRECKED 
TODAY'S THOUGHTS FROM THE 
COMPETITION WATCHDOG ARE STRAIGHT 
FORWARD ONE BIG COMPANY OWNING 
EVERYTHING IS BAD FOR COMPETITION 
IN TERMS OF SERVICE IT IS THE 
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SERVICE AND IT 
IS NOT JUST A QUESTION OF SECURITY 
BUT IT IS ALL THE OTHER EXPERIENCE 
THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH IN 
PASSING THROUGH AN AIRPORT EACH OF 
THEM HAS AN IMPACT ON WHAT 
PASSENGERS ARE GETTING FROM GOING 
THROUGH THAT PARTICULAR AIRPORT SO SO THE COMMISSION IS THINKING OF 
BREAKING UP B. A. A.'S MONOPOLY IN 
SCOTLAND GLASGOW AND EDINBURGH 
DON'T COMPETE PERHAPS THE COMPANY 
WILL HAVE TO SELL ONE IN LONDON 
HEATHROW GATWICK AND STAND STEAD 
AGAIN B. A. A. MAY HAVE TO GIVE ONE UP 
THE COMMISSION BELIEVES IT WOULD 
HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF B. A. A.'S 
TENDENCY TO INVEST IN AIRPORTS ONE 
AT A TIME BUT B. A. A. SAYS EXPANDING 
AIRPORTS IS EXPENSIVE AND IT NEEDS 
TO BE BIG TO PAY FOR THEM THE THE MODEL WE HAVE IS THAT TAXPAYERS 
DON'T PAY FOR THE INVESTMENT SO 
WHEN WE WANT NEW INVESTMENT THAT 
MEANS PRICES GO UP IT IS AS SIMPLE 
AS THAT IF THE OWNER IS NOT IN A 
POSITION TO MAKE PROFITS IT IS NOT 
IN A POSITION TO INVEST 
HERE AT 
GATWICK VIRGIN BELIEVES 
COMPETITION WOULD KEEP UP THE 
PRESSURE ON ISSUES LIKE CUTTING THE 
LENGTH OF SECURITY QUEUES REDUCING 
THE AMOUNT OF SPACE TAKEN UP BY 
SHOPS AND KEEPING THE PRICE OF 
PARKING UNDER CONTROL 
IF THERE WAS 
MORE COMPETITION AMONG AIRPORTS IT 
WOULD MEAN WE COULD GO TO THAT 
AIRPORT AND SAY WHAT ARE YOU GOING 
TO DO TO ATTRACT US AND IMPROVE 
FACILITIES HOW ILL YOU SPEED 
THINGS UP HOW ARE YOU GOING TO LAY 
OUT A ROAD MAP FOR A BETTER SERVICE 
IN FUTURE 
TODAY IS NOT THE FINAL 
VERDICT BUT THE WATCHDOG DOES LOOK 
KEEN ON KNOCKING B. A. A. INTO SHAPE BY 
KNOCKING SOME BIG CHUNKS OFF IT IT 
HAS BEEN A BUSY MORNING THE 
GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED A REVIEW OF 
THE WAY THAT B. A. A. IS REGULATED B. A. A. 
HAS TO HAVE ITS PRICES SET BY AN 
INDEPENDENT REGULATOR THAT IS THE 
CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY T. 
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO REVIEW IT 
BECAUSE IT SAYS IT HAS BEEN TWENTY 
YEARS SINCE THE SYSTEM WAS SET UP 
AND IT NEEDS TO CONSIDER HOW THE 
SYSTEM REFLECTS TODAY'S REALITIES 
PERHAPS WITH THE CATASTROPHE AT 
TERMINAL FIVE AND OTHER PROBLEMS IN 
PARTICULAR IN MIND BRITAIN'S 
SECOND BIGGEST BANK IS ASKING 
SHAREHOLDERS FOR A RECORD TWELVE 
BILLION TO HELP IT GET THROUGH THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH IN EXCHANGE THEY'LL 
GET NEW SHARES AT A FIFTY PER CENT DISCOUNT 
SO WILL IT BE THE ANSWER HUGH PYM 
HAS BEEN FINDING OUT ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND IS SHAKING THE BUCKET 
ASKING SHAREHOLDERS FOR MONEY IT 
IS THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT IN THE 
CRISIS WHICH HAS SEEN BANKS HAVING 
TO PLUG HOLES IN THEIR BALANCE 
SHEETS ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND IS 
ASKING SHARE HOLDERS TO STUMP UP 
TWELVE BILLION IT IS THE BIGGEST SUCH 
EXERCISE IN BRITISH HISTORY IT 
WILL AFFECT MILLIONS OF INVESTORS 
WHETHER THEY ARE SMALL SHAREHOLDERS 
OR WHO HAVE A STAKE THROUGH A 
PENSION FUND OR ANOTHER INVESTMENT 
SCHEME ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND HAS 
EXPANDED AND ITS H. Q. NEAR EDINBURGH 
IS LIKE A SMALL DOWN F. R. TOWN AFTER 
TAKING OVER NATWEST AND PART OF A. B. N. 
AMRO CRITICS SAY ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND OVERREACHED ITSELF AND RAN 
UP BIG LOSSES LINKED TO THE UNITED 
STATES HOUSING MARKET SLUMP SO NOW 
BRITAIN'S NO TWO BANK IS HAVING TO 
RAISE A HUGE CASH SUM SOME 
INCLUDING CUSTOMERS IN SCOTLAND 
ARE NOT IMPRESSED 
IT DOES SEEM AS 
IF THEY HAVE BEEN THAT MANY OF THE 
BANKS SEEM TO BE RESPONSIBLE 
LENDING TOO MUCH L. KNOW THEY ARE 
ALWAYS TRYING TO LEND US MONEY BUT 
REALLY I DON'T WANT THEM TO DROP ME 
AS A CUSTOMER 
IT BOXED THE IMAGE 
THEY PRESENT OF A STABLE 
INSTITUTION I THINK IT REFLECTS 
MORE WELL IT REFLECTS MORE THE 
WIDER PROBLEM THAT IS GOING ON IN 
THE BANKING SECTOR 
OTHER BANKS 
SEEM SET TO FOLLOW THE LEAD 
RAISING CASH TO RIDE OUT THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH EXPERTS SAY CUSTOMERS 
SHOULD NOT EXPECT THINGS TO GET 
EASIER SOON WHEN IT COMES TO 
BORROWING 
WHEN THE CREDIT CRUNCH BORROWING IS OVER FOR THE BANKS AND THEY CAN 
RAISE ENOUGH FUNDS TO CONTINUE 
THEIR BUSINESS THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
WON'T NECESSARILY BE OVER FOR THE 
CONSUMERS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE 
FACING HIGHER MORTGAGE RATES AND 
BORROWING RATES THE BANKS WILL TRY 
AND REBUILD THEIR PROFITS ROYAL ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND WARNED CREDIT 
MARKETS COULD REMAIN DIFFICULT FOR 
SOME TIME LET'S TALK TO OUR 
BUSINESS EDITOR AS WE WERE HEARING 
ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND SAID IT 
WOULDN'T NEED TO DO THIS BUT ARE 
WE LIKELY TO SEE OTHER BANKS 
FOLLOWING SUIT 
AS WE HEARD FROM 
HUGH ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND DOES 
HAVE SOME SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF ITS 
OWN SOME SIX BILLION OF WRITE DOWNS 
OR LOSSES OF LOANS CONNECTED TO THE 
U. S. SUB PRIME AND PRIVATE ECK QUITY 
DEALS BUT THE OUTLOOK FOR ALL 
BANKS HAS GOT WORSE THERE IS A 
GREATER RISK OF LOSSES AND THE 
REGULATOR IS GETTING TOUGH WITH 
THEM HAVING LEARNED THE HARD WAY 
FROM THE COLLAPSE OF NORTHERN ROCK 
THAT IT HAS TO BE HANDS ON IN 
DEALING WITH BANKS SO THERE IS A 
LOT OF PRESSURE ON ALL OF THEM TO 
REBUILD THEIR FOUNDATIONS RAISE 
CASH AND I EXPECT TWO OR THREE 
OTHER FUND RAISINGS 
THE CHANCELLOR 
TALKING TO LENDERS AGAIN ABOUT THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET TODAY WHY HAS HE 
CALLED THE MEETING 
DOWN THE ROAD 
FROM WHERE I AM THE HEADS OF THE 
BANKS WILL BE TROOPING INTO NO ELEVEN 
IT IS BECOMING A REGULAR OCCURRENCE 
THE HEADS OF BANKS SEE THE 
CHANCELLOR TAV PRIME MINISTER THE 
REASON IS THE BANKING SYSTEM IS IN 
A MESS AND IN PARTICULAR THE 
CHANCELLOR IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT 
BANKS NOT PASSING ON WHAT HE 
PERCEIVES IN THE IN AN ADEQUATE 
WAY CUTS IN INTEREST RATES IN THE 
FORM OF LOWER MORTGAGE RATES ARE 
THE BANKS ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE HIM 
A SYMPATHETIC HEARING THEY BELIEVE 
THEY HAVE GOT TO REBUILD THEIR 
PROFITS IN THESE TIMES AND THEY SAY 
IF YOU ARE ON A VARIABLE MORTGAGE 
OF COURSE THE INTEREST RATE WILL 
COME DOWN A BIT IF YOU ARE ON A 
FIXED RATE YOU CAN'T EXPECT A GOOD 
DEAL IN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES 
THANK YOU AND AS WELL AS TRYING TO 
SORT OUT THE COUNTRY'S MORTGAGE 
PROBLEMS THE CHANCELLOR WILL ALSO 
BE TRYING TO AVERT BACKBENCH 
REVOLT OVER THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN 
PENCE TAX BAND TODAY ONE OF THE 
LEADING REBELS FRANK FIELD SAYS 
HE'S GOT ENOUGH M. P.'S TO DEFEAT THE 
GOVERNMENT ON THE MOVE VICKI YOUNG 
IS IN DOWNING STREET CABINET HAS 
MET TODAY WHAT IS THE MOOD GIVE 
WHRAN FRANK FIELD HAS BEEN SAYING 
IT WAS ALL SMILES BUT THEY ARE 
FEELING BATTERED AFTER WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED WE ARE TOLD THAT THE 
CABINET DISCUSSION WAS DOMINATED BY 
DISTUGS ABOUT THE STATE OF THE 
ECONOMY AND THAT TEN P. TAX RATE DID 
COME UP WE ARE TOLD THE GOVERNMENT 
WILL WORK TO PER WADE M. P.'S 
PERSUADE M. P.'S OF THE CASE ALISTAIR 
DARLING WILL MEET BACKBENCHERS BUT 
A MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF WHIP SAYS 
ALL MINISTERS HAVE TO MAKE THE CASE 
AND THAT CASE IS THEY SHOULD LOOK 
AT THE LAST TEN YEARS AND AND HELP 
THAT LABOUR HAVE TARGETED TO THE 
POOREST FAMILIES LIKE THE MINIMUM 
WAGE AND TAX CREDITS AND PEOPLE ARE 
FAR BETTER OFF 
THEY SHOULD PERHAPS 
LOOK AT THE LOCAL LEXS NEXT WEEK 
THEY COULD BE DAMAGING FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS HOW FAR 
WILL THE REBELS GO 
THAT IS THE KEY 
QUESTION FRANK FIELD SAYS HE HAS 
THIRTY NINE LABOUR M. P.'S THE KEY THING IS 
THAT GORDON BROWN MET THEM AND THEY 
DETECTED A CHANGE OF TONE HE 
ACCEPTED THERE WAS A PROBLEM HERE 
THAT HAS HELPED BUT THERE IS STILL 
NO COMPENSATION ON THE TABLE L. 
THINK THAT THE REBELS WILL ASK FOR 
MORE IN THE COMING DAYS BUT KEY 
QUESTION IS WILL THEY THREE DAYS 
BEFORE LOCAL ELECTIONS VOTE DOWN A 
LABOUR BUDGET WHICH COULD MEAN 
PROBLEMS FOR GORDON BROWN'S 
LEADERSHIP I THINK THINKING ABOUT 
THAT MAY MEAN MANY OF THEM STEP 
BACK 
THANK YOU M. P.'S HAVE BACK CRITICISED THE RISE IN THE COST OF 
THE LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS THE 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE CALLED 
THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES ENTIRELY 
UNREALISTIC AND ACCUSED MINISTERS 
OF WISHFUL THINKING THE GOVERNMENT 
INITIALLY SAID THE GAMES WOULD COST 
JUST OVER FOUR BILLION BUT THAT'S 
NOW RISEN TO NINE POINT THREE BILLION TALKS 
ARE UNDERWAY TO AVOID A STRIKE AT 
THE GRANGEMOUTH CRUDE OIL REFINERY 
NEAR FALKIRK WORKERS ARE 
THREATENING TO WALK OUT THIS 
WEEKEND OVER CHANGES TO THEIR

DIFFERENT STORY BABYSITTER

DAYS

THE EDGE OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE LET 
ALONE OURS IT WILL BE FOR THE 
JUDGES TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT 
THIS CONVICTION IS SAFE 
OUR TOP STORY 
SCATHING CRITICISM OF BRITAIN'S 
BIGGEST AIRPORT OWNER THE 
COMPETITION WATCHDOG SAYS B. A. A. MAY 
NOT BE DOING ITS BEST FOR 
PASSENGERS OR THE AIRLINES 
COMING UP MORE PERSONAL DETAILS 
ARE LOST BY THE GOVERNMENT JUST 
HOW SAFE ARE THE RECORDS BEING KEPT 
ON US 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON BLOOD SWEAT 
AND T. SHIRTS HOW A VISIT TO INDIA 
MADE ONE LONDON DESIGNER RETHINK 
HER PASSION FOR FASHION AND WHAT 
INSPIRES YOU ABOUT OUR CAPITAL CITY 
WE FINE OUT HOW LONDON MAKES ART 
THEY SAY MOVING HOUSE IS ALL ABOUT 
LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION WELL 
SO IT WOULD SEEM IS GETTING MARRIED 
MANY COUPLES WOULD LOVE TO TIE THE 
KNOT IN THE IDYLLIC COUNTRY CHURCH 
OF THEIR DREAMS BUT CAN'T BECAUSE 
OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND'S RULES 
WHICH SAY YOU HAVE TO LIVE OR 
WORSHIP IN THAT PARISH BUT ALL 
THAT MAY BE ABOUT TO CHANGE AS OUR 
RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT 
EXPLAINS EXPLAINS IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST DAYS IN A 
COUPLE'S LIVES AND UNTIL RECENTLY 
THEY WANTED TO SPEND IT IN CHURCH 
MOST PEOPLE STILL SEE CHURCH AS THE 
BEST PLACE TO MAKE THEIR VOWS BUT 
NOT ANY CHURCH MANY ARE SIMPLY NOT 
PRETTY ENOUGH FOR THAT ROMANTIC DAY 
YET UNDER THE CURRENT RULES PEOPLE 
CAN MARRY ONLY IN THE PARISH WHERE 
THEY LIVE OR A CHURCH THEY 
REGULARLY ATTEND 
IT MEANS COUPLES ARE FINDING OTHER 
PLACES TO TIE THE KNOT ANY WHERE 
FROM AQUARIUMS AND STATELY HOMES TO 
POSH HOTELS THE ANGLICAN CHURCH'S 
SHARE OF WEDDINGS HAS FALLEN 
SHARPLY FROM HALF IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE TO BARELY 
A THIRD IN TWO THOUSAND ONE 
SO THE RULES ARE BEING DRAMATICALLY 
RELAXED FROM THE AUTUMN PEOPLE WILL 
BE ABLE TO GET MARRIED IN A PARISH 
WHERE THEY'VE LIVED FOR FOR SIX 
MONTHS OR MORE THE PARISH THEIR 
PARENTS LIVED OR WORSHIPPED IN OR 
THE PARISH WHERE THEIR PARENTS OR 
GRANDPARENTS MARRIED 
I HOPE HOPE 
WHEN COMPTON'S ELEVEN TO THE CHURCH 
I HOPE WHEN PEOPLE COME TO THE 
THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN THE PAST 
NOW THEY'LL FIND A GREATER GREATER 
WELCOME AND MORE FLEXIBLE 
BUT THE PRETTYEST PARISHES COULD 
FACE A DELUGE OF COUPLES A ROW 
OVER WHETHER FORMER RESIDENTS CAN 
MARRY IN PICTURESQUE SHERE IN 
SURREY HAS ALREADY DIVIDED THE 
VILLAGE 
PEOPLE COME FOR SPIRITUAL VILLAGE REASONS AND IT'S A PEACEFUL CHURCH 
TO JUST COME BECAUSE IT LOOKS 
PRETTY IN WEDDING PICTURES TO ME IS 
ALMOST BLASPHEMOUS 
THE CHURCH'S 
UNPRECEDENTED EXTENSION IN THE 
CHOICE OPENED TO COUPLES SHOWS HOW 
SERIOUSLY THEY TAKE THE UNDERMINING 
IN THE STATUS OF MARRIAGE IN 
SOCIETY THE CHURCH IN A SECULAR 
AGE IS DETERMINED TO PUT RELIGION 
BACK AT THE HEART OF MARRIAGE EVEN 
IF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE VILLAGES 
LIKE SHERE END UP PAYING PART OF 
THE COST 
TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER WE CAN 
SPEAK TO SOMEONE WHO REALLY KNOWS 
ABOUT WEDDINGS A WEDDING ORGANISER 
SOPHIE LILLINGSTON WEDDING TOURISM 
THAT'S THE CONCERN WHAT WOULD YOU 
SAY TO CLIENTS WHO WOULD LIKE A 
PRETTY CHURCH 
WE ALWAYS RECOMMEND 
I MEAN SOME PEOPLE DO LOOK FOR A 
PRETTY CHURCH AND THAT'S ALL SORT 
OF THE WEDDING HAS BECOME A 
PRODUCTION NOW L. THINK THAT IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO FIND THE VICAR AND THE 
VICAR IS VERY IMPORTANT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE FORGET THIS THEY GET LOST 
IN THE PRODUCTION IN FIFTEEN YEARS OF 
DOING WEDDINGS WE HAVE ONLY HAD ONE 
DIVORCE AND I THINK THAT THE MORE 
YOU PUT INTO THE CHURCH SERVICE THE 
MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT L. THINK A 
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE THINKING THAT AS 
AN AESTHETIC POINT OF VIEW BUT 
THEY SHOULD THINK ABOUT FINDING THE 
RIGHT PERSON THEY CLICK WITH TO DO 
THE SERVICE 
DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR 
CLIENTS WOULD BE MORE INCLINED OR 
PEOPLE IN GENERAL MIGHT BE MORE 
INCLINED TO GET MARRIED IN CHURCHES 
IT'S BECOME A BIG BUSINESS A 
COSTLY BUSINESS AND PERHAPS CHURCH 
MIGHT BE A MORE ATTRACTIVE OPTION 
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT 
ON THE FINANCE SIDE SO MUCH L. 
THINK IT'S MORE IF THEY WANT TO 
START FAMILY THEY WANT TO START 
AFRESH AND A LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN 
BROUGHT UP IN RELIGIOUS WAY AND 
THEY MIGHT HAVE LET THE RELIGIOUS 
SIDE GO A LITTLE BIT BUT THEIR 
BELIEF IS STILL THERE 
WE WILL SEE 
MORE CHURCH WEDDINGS AS A RESULT DO 
YOU THINK 
I THINK WE WILL A LOT 
OF THE VICARS IF THEY'RE KICKING 
WITH CONNECTING WITH THE PEOPLE 
THEN A LOT OF OUR PEOPLE DO WANT TO 
GET MARRIED IN A CHURCH THEY JUST 
CAN'T FIND THE RIGHT PERSON TO 
CONNECT WITH 
AND NOW PERHAPS THEY 
CAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE INCREASINGLY BITTER BATTLE FOR 
THE DEMOCRATS' PRESIDENTIAL 
NOMINATION MOVES TO PENNSYLVANIA 
TODAY IT'S IT'S LAST OF THE BIG 
STATES TO HOLD A PRIMARY AND 
HILLARY CLINTON IS EXPECTED TO WIN 
BUT SHE WILL NEED A CONVINCING 
VICTORY OVER BARACK OBAMA IF SHE IS 
TO KEEP HER CAMPAIGN ALIVE OUR 
WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN 
JONATHAN BEALE REPORTS 
THE TONE HAS BECOME MORE EXTREME 
AND CONFRONTATIONAL HILLARY 
CLINTON'S LATEST COMMERCIAL USING 
IMAGES OF PEARL HARBOUR AND EVEN 
OSAMA BIN LADEN TO SUGGEST ONLY SHE 
COULD WITHSTAND THE PRESSURES OF 
OFFICE BARACK OBAMA THE CANDIDATE 
OF CHANGE HAS RESORTED TO OLD 
STYLE NEGATIVE ATTACKS 
BUILD UP TO PENNSYLVANIA HAS LOOKED 
INCREASINGLY LIKE A NO HOLDS BARRED 
CONTEST THIS PRIME TIME T. V. 
WRESTLING SHOW EVEN HAD ANIMATED 
VERSIONS OF THE CANDIDATES BATTLING 
IT OUT IN THE RING IT HASN'T COME 
TO THAT BUT THEIR DIRECT APPEAL TO 
THE SHOW'S FANS ADDS TO A SENSE OF 
DESPERATION 
YOU CAN CALL ME HILL DESPERATION ROD THIS ELECTION IS STARTING TO 
FEEL LIKE KING OF THE RING 
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE THE LAST MAN 
STANDING MAY JUST BE A WOMAN 
ALL THE FORCES OF DIVISION AND 
DISTRACTION THAT HAVE STOPPED US 
FROM MAKING PROGRESS FOR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE I HAVE ONE QUESTION 
DO YOU SMELL WHAT BARACK IS 
COOKING COOKING IN SIX WEEKS OF CAMPAIGNING BOTH 
CANDIDATES HAVE GONE TO 
EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS TO SHOW THAT 
THEY'RE IN TUNE WITH ORDINARY 
VOTERS BUT IT'S HILLARY CLINTON 
WHO NEEDS THE CONVINCING WIN JUST 
TO STAY IN THE RACE 
THE B. B. C. HAS LEARNED THAT BRITISH 
AND AMERICAN AMERICAN SPECIAL 
FORCES ARE CARRYING OUT OPERATIONS 
IN AND AROUND BASRA IN THE SOUTH OF 
IRAQ MILITARY SOURCES HAVE SAID 
IT'S TO DETAIN SENIOR FIGURES FROM 
THE MILITIAS WHICH ARE FIGHTING 
SECURITY FORCES LET'S GET MORE 
FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT IN BAGHDAD 
THERE MIGHT BE SOME SURPRISE TO 
HEAR OF THIS BRITISH INVOLVEMENT 
CONSIDERING THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO 
BE IN AN OVERWATCH POSITION WELL WELL ABSOLUTELY THROUGHOUT THE MILITARY 
CAMPAIGNS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON 
AGAINST SHI'ITE MILITIAS IN BASRA 
AND IN BAGHDAD BOTH THE BRITISH 
MILITARY AND THE GOVERNMENT AND 
ALSO THE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN 
STRESSING ALL ALONG THAT THIS IS AN 
IRAQI LED AND EXECUTED CAMPAIGN 
BUT WE HAVE NOW LEARNED FROM A 
WESTERN MILITARY SOURCE THAT 
BRITISH AND AMERICAN SPECIAL FORCES 
ARE ON THE GROUND WHAT THEY'RE 
DOING IS THEY'RE TRYING TO DETAIN 
SENIOR FIGURES FROM THE MEHDI ARMY 
OTHER MILITIAS AND ALSO A TRIBE IN 
THE CITY OF BASRA L. THINK REALLY 
IT'S ATACIT ACCEPTANCE OF THE 
DIFFICULTIES THE IRAQI FORCES HAVE 
BEEN FACING IN THE CITY WE ARE 
GETTING SOME INDICATIONS THAT BASRA 
MAY BE SLOWLY IMPROVING APPARENTLY 
COUPLES ARE NOW WALKING BY THE 
RIVER BUT THE THE CHANGES THAT 
HAVE COME ARE STILL REVERSIBLE 
THANK YOU 
HOW SAFE ARE THE PERSONAL DETAILS 
KEPT ON US BY THE GOVERNMENT AND 
COMPANIES OVER THE LAST YEAR THERE 
HAVE BEEN NUMBER OF SECURITY 
BREACHES THINGS LIKE LOST DATA 
DISCS AND LAPTOPS TODAY WE WERE 
TOLD THERE HAD BEEN EVEN MORE THAN 
WE THOUGHT THE INFORMATION 
COMMISSIONER RICHARD THAPL AS 
THOMAS SAYS HE HAS BEEN TOLD OF NINETY FOUR 
SINCE NOVEMBER AND HAS CALLED THAT 
UNACCEPTABLE HERE IS OUR 
TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT 
IN THE HEART OF BRITAIN'S SECURITY 
SERVICES HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL 
PERSONAL DATA IS GOING MISSING IN 
AN ALARMING FASHION SPOOKS IS 
FICTION BUT IN THE REAL WORLD IT'S 
NOT HARD TO FIND GOVERNMENT 
DEPARTMENTS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES 
LEAKING DATA THE INFORMATION 
COMMISSIONER SAYS LAST NOVEMBER'S 
LOSS OF RECORDS HAS BEEN FOLLOWED 
BY NINETY FOUR OTHER EXAMPLES OF SECURITY 
BREACHES EVERYTHING FROM A STOLEN 
MOD LAPTOP WITH DETAILS OF RECRUITS 
TO BANK DETAILS AND HEALTH RECORDS 
THE WORLD'S COMPUTER SECURITY 
INDUSTRY IS GATHERED IN LONDON FOR 
A MAJOR CONFERENCE WITH STUDIES 
SHOWING THAT GOVERNMENTS AND 
COMPANIES AREN'T DOING ENOUGH TO 
PROTECT DATA STIFFER PENALTIES IS 
ONE ANSWER ACCORDING TO PEER 
WHO IS ALSO A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER 
PUBLIC SERVANTS SHOULD NOT 
MISBEHAVE THEY HAVE A DUTY TO THE 
PUBLIC NEARLY ALL PURL SERVANTS 
KNOW THAT BUT THERE IS ONE OR TWO 
ROTTEN APPLES AND THOSE ARE THE 
ONES WE MUST WATCH FOR 
IT'S NOT 
JUST ABOUT PROTECTING COMPUTER 
NETWORKS FROM INTRUDERS BUT 
CHANGING STAFF BEHAVIOUR WHEN YOU 
CAN GET THE ENTIRE CHILD BENEFIT 
INFORMATION ON A DISC OR MORE DATA 
ON YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE STAFF 
CAN'T SIMPLY PLUG SOMETHING IN AND 
WALK OUT OF THE BUILDING WITH 
EVERYONE'S PERSONAL DETAILS IT'S 
NOT TOO DIFFICULT TO LOCK THE DATA 
ON COMPUTERS AWAY FROM PRYING EYES 
FOUR OUT OF FIVE STOLEN COMPANY 
LAPTOPS DIDN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF 
PROTECTION 
YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE PROTECTION WAY THAT STAFF BEHAVE WHEN THEY 
LOOK AFTER CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 
THEY SHOULD NEVER BE PUTTING 
CUSTOMER INFORMATION ON TO INSECURE 
MEDIA THEY SHOULDN'T BE SENDING 
THINGS IN THE POST SHOULDN'T BE 
PUTTING CUSTOMERS' INFORMATION AT 
RISK 
WE HAVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF RISK PERSONAL INFORMATION ON GOVERNMENT 
AND COMPANY COMPUTERS AND THEY'RE 
UNDER PRESSURE TO SHOW THAT THEY'RE 
KEEPING IT SAFE 
THE ACTOR EWAN MCGREGOR HAS BEEN 
SPEAKING FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT 
BEING DIAGNOSED WITH SKIN CANCER 
THE STAR OF MOULIN ROUGE AND THE 
STAR WARS PREQUELS HAS TOLD THE B. B. C.

SKINNED AND SPENT TIME IN THE SUN 
I SPENT TO SEE A SPECIALIST WHO 
THOUGHT THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED AND 
INDEED HE WAS CORRECT 
TEN YEARS AFTER SHE DIED LINDA 
MCCARTNEY'S WORK AS A PHOTOGRAPHER 
IS GOING ON DISPLAY IN AN 
EXHIBITION ORGANISED BY SIR PAUL 
MCCARTNEY THE IMAGES SPAN HER 
CAREER FROM THE NINETEEN SIXTIES UNTIL HER

SHOW IN THIS EXHIBITION THERE ARE 
OTHER PICTURES CHOSEN BY SIR PAUL 
MCCARTNEY WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN 
SEEN BEFORE INCLUDING THIS ONE OF 
HER TAKEN BY HIM

HER WORK UNFOLD SO I HAVE A 
PERSONAL INTEREST IN IT OBVIOUSLY 
AS MY FAMILY DOES IT'S MY WIFE 
IT'S THEIR MUM YOU KNOW HER 
PICTURES 
THIS IS BY NO MEANSA HUGE PICTURES EXHIBITION BUT WHILE LINDA 
MCCARTNEY'S REPUTATION AS A 
PHOTOGRAPHER WAS LONG ESTABLISHED 
BEFORE SHE MET SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY 
IT IS HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH THIS 
EXHIBITION IN THE LIGHT OF HIS VERY 
PUBLIC DIVORCE FROM HIS SECOND WIFE 
THAT WILL RESULT IN HUGE MEDIA 
INTEREST INTEREST AND THERE ARE PICTURES HERE 
PROMPTED BY SIR PAUL'S OWN PERSONAL 
MEMORIES 
THIS WAS AT ABBEY ROAD MEMORIES STUDIOS AND IT'S PROBABLY AROUND 
ABOUT THE TIME OF DOING AN ALBUM 
WHICH BECAME KNOWN AS AS THE WHITE 
ALBUM WHAT I LIKE IS YOU CAN SEE 
TPHEB'S NOBODY'S BOTHERED ABOUT 
THE PHOTOGRAPHER SHE'S MELTED INTO 
THE BACKGROUND ALSO YOU CAN SEE 
HOW MUCH JOHN AND I ENJOYED WORKING 
TOGETHER IT'S JUST A MOMENT IN 
TIME CAPTURED BY SOMEONE THAT WE 
OBVIOUSLY WEREN'T INTIMIDATED BY 
LINDA MCCARTNEY WAS MARRIED TO SIR 
PAUL FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES THIS 
EXHIBITION PRESENTS HIM WITH AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO DISPLAY THE PRIDE HE 
HAS IN HER AND HER WORK BUT ALSO 
REVEALS SOME OF HIS HAPPIEST 
MEMORIES MEMORIES NOW WHEN YOU THINK OF TULIPS YOU 
PROBABLY THINK OF THE LINKS WITH 
HOLLAND BUT ACTUALLY THE FLOWER 
CAME FROM MUCH FURTHER EAST TURKEY 
IN FACT WHERE FOR CENTURIES IT 
GRACED THE PALACES OF THE OTTOMAN 
EMPERORS 
TODAY IS STAND BULL TODAY ISTANBUL IS HOME AGAIN TO A MASSIVE FESTIVAL 
IT'S THE WEATHER FOR PLANTS AT THE 
MOMENT THIS AFTERNOON SOME LOVELY 
SPRING SUN BEHIND FOR ALL OF US TO
