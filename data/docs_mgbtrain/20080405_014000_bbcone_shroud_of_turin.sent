THE PROOF OF THAT WOULD BE THE PRESENCE OF MEDIUM TO BIND THE PIGMENT 
THE SHROUD OF TURIN IS ABOUT TO BE EXAMINED IN A WAY IT HAS NEVER BEEN BEFORE 
THE MOST FAMOUS THING ABOUT THE SHROUD NOW 
IS THAT IT IS A MEDIEVAL FAKE AND NOT THE BURIAL CLOTH OF CHRIST AS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE BELIEVED 
THAT WAS THE VERDICT OF A CARBON FOURTEEN TEST DONE EXACTLY TWENTY YEARS AGO 
BUT THE IRRESISTIBLE FORCE OF SCIENCE SEEMS TO HAVE HIT AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT 
NEW EVIDENCE HAS APPEARED WHICH CONTRADICTS THE RESULTS OF THE CARBON FOURTEEN TEST 
SO WHY WON'T THIS IMAGE OF A NAKED AND BATTERED MAN JUST LIE DOWN AND DIE 
THERE IS ONE VERY GOOD REASON 
NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO WORK OUT HOW THE FORGER DID IT 
NO ONE DESPITE MANY ATTEMPTS HAS BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE AN IMAGE WITH THE SAME PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS 
IT'S A MYSTERY 
AND INTO THIS VACUUM HAS RUSHED A NEW AND FOR MANY UNTHINKABLE QUESTION 
IS IT AFTER ALL NOT THE SHROUD THAT MAY BE FOUND WANTING BUT THE CARBON FOURTEEN TEST APPLIED TO IT 
ON THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THAT TEST 
PHYSICISTS ARE PREPARING A NEW CARBON FOURTEEN TEST 
IT WILL SHOW IF THE ORIGINAL CARBON FOURTEEN TEST COULD HAVE LIED 
SO JUST WHAT IS THE NEW EVIDENCE RELATING TO THE SHROUD OF TURIN 
AND COULD IT RESURRECT THE SHROUD AS THE MOST POTENT RELIC OF CHRISTIANITY 
I'M EMBARKING ON A JOURNEY THAT WILL SPAN THREE CONTINENTS AND TAKE ME TO THE VERY HEART OF CHRISTIAN HISTORY 
AND TO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE CLOSELY EXAMINED THE SHROUD 
TURIN SITS IN THE PLAIN AT THE FOOT OF THE ALPS IN NORTHERN ITALY 
THIS IS THE HOME OF THE SHROUD THE CATHEDRAL OF JOHN THE BAPTIST 
WELL THIS IS QUITE A MOMENT FOR ME 
MY FIRST AWARENESS OF THE SHROUD CAME WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL IN THE EIGHTIES 
A LOT OF NEW RESEARCH APPEARED TO HOLD OUT THE PROSPECT 
THAT IT WAS INDEED THE MOST IMPORTANT RELIC IN CHRISTENDOM 
THE LAST TIME THE SHROUD WAS SHOWN WAS IN TWO THOUSAND 
AND IT'S NOT DUE TO BE SEEN AGAIN UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TEN AT THE EARLIEST 
VISITORS HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH THE SIGHT OF ITS FIRE PROOF CASE 
BUT ALREADY THERE IS A SURPRISE IN STORE 
SOMETHING REMARKABLE HAS JUST HAPPENED 
NEWS HAS COME TO ME FROM THE CARDINAL'S SECRETARY 
THE CARDINAL HAS AGREED FOR ITS VEIL TO BE LIFTED FOR US 
IN THIS SIDE CHAPEL THE WINDOWS ARE BEING BLACKED OUT AND THE HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURE MEASURED 
UNDER CONSIDERABLE SECRECY THIS ROOM IS BEING PREPARED 
SO THAT OUR CAMERA TEAMS CAN FILM THE SHROUD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIGH DEFINITION 
WHILE THE PREPARATIONS TAKE PLACE I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE KEY FEATURES OF THE SHROUD 
THE FIRST THING THAT STRIKES YOU IS THAT SINCE THE CARBON FOURTEEN TEST 
THE CHURCH MAKES NO CLAIMS FOR ITS AUTHENTICITY 
BUT IT DOES MAINTAIN ITS IMPORTANCE AS AN OBJECT OF DEVOTION 
BEHIND THAT GLASS AND COVER LIES THE FINEST ITALIAN ENGINEERING 
DESIGNED TO KEEP IT SAFE AND IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF INERT GAS MONITORED MINUTE BY MINUTE 
PROFESSOR BRUNO BARBERIS IS THE CURATOR OF THE MUSEUM DEDICATED TO THE SHROUD 
AND A VISIT TO THE MUSEUM BEGINS WITH A FILM 
AN INTRIGUING REVELATION IS THAT THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY THE SHROUD HAS OFTEN BEEN DISPLAYED IN PUBLIC 
IT MAY SEEM LIKE A TRIVIAL DETAIL BUT IT COULD BE IMPORTANT TO THE INVESTIGATION 
COULD THE SHROUD HAVE BEEN CONTAMINATED IN ANY WAY AND SO DISTORT ITS TRUE AGE 
ANOTHER RELEVANT DETAIL IS THAT ARTISTS HAVE TRIED TO IMAGINE 
HOW THE CLOTH MUST HAVE BEEN WRAPPED AROUND THE BODY 
TO CREATE THE IMAGE OF THE FRONT AND BACK 
THE ANSWER COULD SHED LIGHT ON THE AGE OF THE CLOTH 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO A FIRE MELTED THE METAL BOX IN WHICH THE SHROUD WAS KEPT 
LEAVING BEHIND A GEOMETRICAL PATTERN OF BURNS 
MIRACULOUSLY THE IMAGE WAS PRESERVED INTACT 
AND FINALLY A PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT GOES TO THE HEART OF THE DEBATE OVER THE AGE OF THE SHROUD 
ALL WE CAN KNOW FOR CERTAIN IS THAT BEFORE TURIN 
THE SHROUD CAN ONLY BE RELIABLY TRACED BACK TO THE VILLAGE OF LIREY IN FRANCE 
WHERE IT WAS IN THE POSSESSION OF THIS MAN GEOFFREY DE CHARNEY 
WHO FIRST EXHIBITED IT IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY 
THAT DATE IS VERY SIGNIFICANT 
BECAUSE CARBON FOURTEEN DATES THE SHROUD AT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PLUS OR MINUS SIXTY FIVE YEARS 
IT ALL SEEMS TO CHECK OUT 
MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE SHROUD THEN IS THAT ON THE FACE OF IT 
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO DISMISS IT AS MEDIEVAL FORGERY 
BUT AS I'M ABOUT TO DISCOVER THERE IS MORE A GREAT DEAL MORE TO THIS CLOTH THAN MEETS THE EYE 
THE DAY FOR THE FILMING HAS ARRIVED 
THESE WILL BE THE FIRST HIGH DEFINITION MOVING IMAGES EVER TAKEN 
YEAH TURNING OVER 
TO PROTECT IT ONLY THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT IS USED 
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO PICK EVERYTHING OUT BUT THEN IT BECAME QUITE CLEAR 
LYING BETWEEN THE GEOMETRIC PATCHES FROM THE FIRE 
THE IMAGE OF THE FRONT AND BACK OF A MAN'S BODY 
WITH WHAT SEEM LIKE SCOURGE MARKS AND THE VERY SPECIFIC WOUNDS OF A CRUCIFIXION 
THE CLOTH ITSELF IS ABOUT FOUR METRES OF LINEN WITH TRACES OF COTTON 
IT HAS A DISTINCTIVE HERRING BONE WEAVE 
AND THE SCORCHES FROM THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO FIRE 
THESE SHOW IT WAS ONCE FOLDED IN FORTY EIGHT 
AND ANOTHER CURIOUS SET OF L. SHAPED SCARS SHOW THAT AT ONE TIME 
IT MUST ALSO HAVE BEEN FOLDED IN FOUR 
THESE OBSERVATIONS COULD BE IMPORTANT 
THIS IS THE IMAGE THE SHROUD REVEALS TO THE NAKED EYE 
BUT WITH THE HELP OF SOME TECHNOLOGY THE EYE CAN SEE MORE 
BY FIRST REMOVING THE COLOUR AND THEN REVERSING LIGHT AND SHADE 
WE CREATE A NEGATIVE OF THE IMAGE 
PHOTOGRAPHY FIRST CAPTURED THIS A CENTURY AGO BUT TODAY IT CAN BE DONE AT THE PRESS OF A BUTTON 
THIS IS A CLEARER IMAGE OF THE FIGURE ON THE CLOTH 
THIS IS THE TRUE POSITIVE 
IT'S THE IMAGE ON THE CLOTH THAT IS IN FACT A NEGATIVE 
THIS IS THE CAMERA WHICH REVEALED TO THE WORLD A MUCH CLEARER IMAGE OF THE SHROUD 
IN ITS NEGATIVE FORM THE SHROUD WAS SOMEHOW MORE RECOGNISABLE AND EASILY DISCERNIBLE 
AND WHAT'S MORE PHOTOGRAPHY MEANT THAT THE IMAGE OF THE SHROUD COULD TRAVEL FAR AND WIDE 
AND INTEREST IN IT BEGAN TO GROW AROUND THE WORLD 
FOR BELIEVERS THE APPEAL WAS IRRESISTIBLE 
THE SHROUD SEEMED TO HOLD OUT THE PROMISE OF A TANGIBLE CONTACT 
WITH CHRIST HIMSELF AT THE CRISIS OF HIS SUFFERING ON THE CROSS 
AND HERE WERE THE KEY IDENTIFIERS 
THE WOUNDS FROM THE LANCE IN THE SIDE 
AND THE CROWN OF THORNS 
BUT CARBON FOURTEEN ENDED THAT HOPE 
AND MANY RELIGIOUS HEARTS WERE BROKEN 
A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS HAVE SINCE GROWN UP KNOWING ALMOST NOTHING ABOUT THE SHROUD 
BUT WHATEVER THE RESULT OF THE CARBON FOURTEEN TEST THE SHROUD HAS REMAINED AN ENIGMA 
AND THE ENIGMA IS THIS 
IF THE SHROUD OF TURIN IS A MEDIEVAL FAKE THEN HOW EXACTLY WAS THE IMAGE FORGED 
LYING IN THE SHADOW OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS IN THE UNITED STATES IS COLORADO SPRINGS 
IT'S THE HOME OF THE MAN WHO HAS STUDIED THE SHROUD CLOSER AND LONGER THAN ANYONE ELSE 
JOHN JACKSON IS A DOCTOR IN COSMOLOGY AND LECTURER IN PHYSICS 
TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE REBECCA HE RUNS THE TURIN SHROUD CENTRE OF COLORADO 
THROUGH HIS RESEARCH HE HAS HAD ONE OF THE FEW FULL SIZE 
HIGH DEFINITION STILL IMAGES OF THE SHROUD FOR SOME TIME 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHEN INTEREST IN THE SHROUD WAS AT ITS HEIGHT 
HE LED A LARGE TEAM OF SCIENTISTS TO TURIN WHERE THEY EXAMINED THE SHROUD FOR A WEEK 
NO ONE SINCE HAS SECURED SUCH FULL ACCESS TO THE CLOTH 
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA WERE EXTRACTED 
JACKSON BECAME THE PRIMARY CUSTODIAN OF THIS DATA AND HE HAS CONTINUED THE WORK 
ONLY NOW DOES HE FEEL READY TO SHARE HIS FINDINGS EXCLUSIVELY WITH US 
AND LIKE EVERYONE ELSE JACKSON WANTS TO SOLVE THE RIDDLE OF THE SHROUD 
IF IT'S A FOURTEENTH CENTURY FORGERY THEN HOW WAS IT DONE 
COULD A MEDIEVAL ARTIST HAVE CREATED THE DISTINCTIVE PROPERTIES OF THIS IMAGE 
THE FIRST THING JACKSON ESTABLISHED IS THAT THE CLOTH CAN BE WRAPPED AROUND A BODY 
THE BLOOD STAINS ON THE BACK AND FRONT OF THE CLOTH MATCH EXACTLY WHERE THEY SHOULD 
PLACE IT OVER THE THREE DIMENSIONAL MAN THAT WE HAVE HERE 
NOW I'M GOING TO PULL THIS INTENTIONALLY STRAIGHT 
AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO NOTICE FIRST OF ALL 
THAT THIS BLOOD STAIN RIGHT HERE 
IS WHICH IS THIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FEET 
IS TOTALLY HANGING OFF THE END YES TOTALLY OFF IMAGE 
LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE MAKE THE HANDS ALIGN PROPERLY 
LOOK NOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BLOOD STAIN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CLOTH 
ROLL IT BACK IT'S EXACTLY WHERE A NAIL WOULD HAVE BEEN 
ONCE KEY FEATURES WERE ALIGNED EVERYTHING ELSE FELL INTO PLACE 
EVEN THE STAINS FROM ONE END OF THE CLOTH TO THE OTHER 
IF WE'RE DEALING WITH A MEDIEVAL RELIC THEN IT'S ONE THAT'S BEEN METICULOUSLY CREATED 
AND WE KNOW THAT THE BLOOD STAINS ARE NOT PAINT 
JACKSON'S TEAM IDENTIFIED IT AS BLOOD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT 
BUT WHAT OF THE IMAGE ITSELF 
THE IMAGE ON THE SHROUD 
HAS SOME VERY INTERESTING CHARACTERISTICS TO IT 
AND THESE ARE NOT ONLY INTERESTING BUT THEY'RE SCIENTIFIC CHARACTERISTICS 
THE SIMPLEST HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE FORGER PAINTED THE IMAGE 
THE PROOF OF THAT WOULD BE THE PRESENCE OF MEDIUM TO BIND THE PIGMENT 
WE ARE GOING IN NOW TO A CLOSE UP OF THE DARKEST PART OF THE IMAGE THE NOSE 
AND FURTHER TO A MICROSCOPIC PICTURE OF THE SAME AREA 
THE IMAGE IS ONLY ON THE SURFACE FIBRILS OF THE CLOTH 
THESE FIBRILS WHICH ARE ON THE ORDER OF THE SIZE OF THE DIAMETER OF A HUMAN HAIR 
THESE ARE THE FIBRILS THAT ARE TWISTED TOGETHER TO MAKE THREADS 
IF YOU LOOK THESE FIBRILS ARE INDIVIDUALLY COLOURED 
THEY BEAR THAT COLOUR THAT IS THE BODY IMAGE AT THE MICROSCOPIC LEVEL 
NOTICE THAT THOSE FIBRILS ARE NOT CEMENTED TOGETHER BY ANY KIND OF PAINT 
WHAT WE SEE AND THIS IS THE OBSERVATION MICROSCOPICALLY 
IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL FIBRILS OF THE SHROUD ARE COLOURED 
TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE CLOTH SIDEWAYS ON 
IF WE MAGNIFY ITS THICKNESS WE FIND THAT THE FIBRILS THAT BEAR THE IMAGE 
ARE LITERALLY JUST ON THE SURFACE 
NOTHING HAS SEEPED INTO THE CLOTH BELOW 
WHAT THIS OBSERVATION DOES AND THIS ILLUSTRATES THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD 
IS THE HYPOTHESIS OF AN ARTIST USING A PIGMENT THAT HAS SOME VISCOSITY TO IT 
IS EXCLUDED I BELIEVE BY THIS SINGULAR OBSERVATION ON THE SHROUD 
IF THE IMAGE IS NOT A PAINTING JACKSON CONSIDERED THE IDEA THAT AN EMBALMER SUBJECTED A REAL BODY 
TO THE HORRORS OF CRUCIFIXION AND THEN WRAPPED A CLOTH AROUND IT 
BUT A SIMPLE LOOK AT THE IMAGE OF THE FACE SHOWS THAT CONTACT 
BETWEEN THE BODY AND THE CLOTH ALONE COULD NOT HAVE FORMED THE IMAGE 
THE EYE SOCKETS AND THE OTHER RECESSES ON THE BODY 
AS WELL AS THE HAIR AT THE SIDE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE BODY 
AND IF THEY WERE THE RESULTING IMAGE WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS 
IF THE IMAGE IS A FAKE IT CAN'T BE THE WORK OF EITHER A PAINTER OR AN EMBALMER 
OF COURSE THE CARBON FOURTEEN TEST STILL POINTS TO THE SHROUD BEING A MEDIEVAL RELIC 
BUT JACKSON HAS IDENTIFIED TWO PROPERTIES OF THE IMAGE 
THAT A FORGER WOULD HAVE HAD TO REPRODUCE PROPERTIES THAT ONLY MODERN TECHNOLOGY CAN DETECT 
THE FIRST IS THE FACT THAT THE NAKED EYE ONLY SEES A NEGATIVE IMAGE OF THE BODY 
THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO THINK OF THE IMAGE AS BEING THE WORK OF AN ARTIST 
THEN IT WOULD SEEM THAT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH 
IS THE IDEA OF SOMEBODY COMPOSING THE IMAGE IN A NEGATIVE REVERSE 
TO THE WAY WE NORMALLY SEE A HUMAN BEING 
AND PUT THIS ONTO A PIECE OF CLOTH A LONG PIECE OF CLOTH 
WITH A TECHNIQUE WHICH ALSO HAS DEFINABLE CHARACTERISTICS 
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO IMAGINE 
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WHOEVER WOULD HAVE OR HYPOTHETICAL ARTIST 
WOULD HAVE NOT HAD THE LUXURY OF BEING ABLE TO CHECK HIS WORK 
THE SECOND UNIQUE PROPERTY OF THE IMAGE IS ONE DISCOVERED 
BY JACKSON HIMSELF ITS THREE DIMENSIONAL QUALITY 
HE DISCOVERED FROM HIS EXPERIMENTAL WRAPPINGS 
THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE IMAGE VARIES WITH THE DISTANCE THE BODY IS FROM THE CLOTH 
THE TIP OF THE NOSE FOR EXAMPLE IS DARKER THAN THE HOLLOW OF THE EYE 
I WANTED TO KNOW IF WE COULD SEE THIS WITH OUR NEW HIGH DEFINITION IMAGES 
AND SURE ENOUGH WITH THE SIMPLEST PRESS OF A BUTTON IN OUR EDITING SUITE THIS THREE D. QUALITY IS REVEALED 
I WAS ASTOUNDED WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO DO THIS 
THAT THE BRIGHTER SURFACE THAT YOU CREATE BY THE COMPUTER LOOKED AS YOU CAN SEE HERE 
VERY MUCH LIKE A THREE DIMENSIONAL PERSON PARTICULARLY THE FACE 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACIAL STRUCTURE YOU'VE GOT THE NOSE IN PROPER RELATIONSHIP TO THE CHEEKS 
WHICH ARE IN PROPER RELATIONSHIP TO THE EYE SOCKETS AND SO FORTH 
THESE SPECIAL PROPERTIES OF THE CLOTH NARROW THE OPTIONS 
MAYBE THE FORGER WAS A SCULPTOR 
A MEDIEVAL TECHNIQUE FOR CREATING BOTH PROPERTIES IS BAS RELIEF 
A SCULPTOR CREATES A THREE D. MODEL IN STONE OR METAL 
TO TRANSFER THE IMAGE ONTO THE CLOTH THE BAS RELIEF IS HEATED 
AND THE CLOTH PLACED OVER IT LONG ENOUGH TO BE SCORCHED 
IT'S AN OPTION THAT JACKSON HAS EXPERIMENTED WITH 
THE REAL TEST OF THIS METHOD IS WHETHER THE HEATED SCULPTURE CAN SCORCH AN IMAGE ON THE SURFACE 
AND ONLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE CLOTH 
SO I USED THAT MAKING A HOT BAS RELIEF TRYING TO IMPRESS THAT ON THE CLOTH 
AND YES YOU CAN GET SOME IMAGES THAT COULD HAVE SOME PSEUDO THREE DIMENSIONAL QUALITY 
AND ALSO A HIGH RESOLUTION 
BUT THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT TO PUT A SURFACE DISCOLOURATION ON THE CLOTH ON THE FIBRILS 
HEAT WILL DISCOLOUR THROUGH THE THICKNESS OF THE SHROUD 
IN ABOUT ONE ONE HUNDREDTH TO ONE TENTH OF A SECOND 
SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE BAS RELIEF ON THE CLOTH AND TAKE IT AWAY ON A TIMESCALE LIKE THAT 
IN ORDER TO BE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE OBSERVE 
SO IT JUST GOES ON AND ON THE PROBLEMS JUST DON'T SEEM TO WORK 
TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM SOME TESTS HAVE DAUBED PAINT TO TRANSFER THE BAS RELIEF ONTO THE CLOTH 
THE RESULT DOES SHOW SOME NEGATIVE AND THREE D. QUALITIES 
THE TROUBLE IS THAT THEY ARE DISTORTED AND CRUDE 
ALSO THIS METHOD USES PAINT 
AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY EVIDENCE OF A BINDING MEDIUM ON THE CLOTH DOES RULE THAT OUT 
I MUST SAY THAT 
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TRY TO EXPLAIN THE SHROUD IMAGE 
AND THIS WORK NEEDS TO CONTINUE MOST DEFINITELY 
BUT ONE HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON A HYPOTHESIS 
THAT CAN EXPLAIN THE TOTALITY OF ALL IMAGE CHARACTERISTICS 
AND YOU CAN'T JUST GO AND PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT AND THAT'S ALL TOO OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS 
SCIENCE SAYS THE SHROUD IS A FOURTEENTH CENTURY FAKE 
BUT SO FAR NO ONE HAS FOUND A MEDIEVAL TECHNIQUE TO ACCURATELY REPRODUCE THE IMAGE 
NO WONDER THE FASCINATION WITH THE SHROUD OF TURIN CONTINUES 
THE SEARCH FOR A METHOD OF CREATING THE IMAGE ON THE SHROUD WILL GO ON 
BUT IN THE MEANTIME THE FAILURE IS RAISING A NEW AND CONTROVERSIAL POSSIBILITY 
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE CARBON FOURTEEN TEST ITSELF WAS IN ANY SOME FLAWED 
IT'S A POSSIBILITY THAT'S GAINING CURRENCY 
BECAUSE THERE IS NEW EVIDENCE THAT PLACES THE SHROUD OF TURIN EARLIER IN TIME 
HISTORIANS HAVE IDENTIFIED ANOTHER SHROUD OF CHRIST IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY IN CONSTANTINOPLE 
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS IF THIS SHROUD COULD BE THE SAME AS THE ONE IN TURIN 
IF IT IS IT WOULD PUSH THE DATE OF THE TURIN SHROUD 
BACK BY AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED SIXTY YEARS 
AND CHALLENGE THE ACCURACY OF THE CARBON FOURTEEN TEST 
THE EVIDENCE FOR A TWELFTH CENTURY SHROUD OF CHRIST SURFACED RECENTLY 
IN A DOCUMENT CALLED THE PRAY MANUSCRIPT 
IT'S IN HUNGARY AND TAKES ITS NAME FROM THE SCHOLAR WHO FIRST EXAMINED IT 
IT CAN BE RELIABLY DATED TO ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX 
THIS IS ONE OF ITS FIVE ILLUSTRATIONS 
AND IT SHOWS JESUS BEING PLACED IN HIS BURIAL SHROUD 
MECHTHILD FLURY LEMBERG IS A TEXTILE EXPERT WHO'S CHARGED WITH PRESERVING THE FABRIC OF THE SHROUD 
SHE HAS STUDIED THESE IMAGES OF CHRIST IN THE MANUSCRIPT 
AND IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF FEATURES THAT RE APPEAR ON THE TURIN SHROUD 
THE MOST OBVIOUS IS THAT THE FIGURE ON THE SHROUD HAS THE ARMS CROSSED 
AND THE THUMB HIDDEN UNDER THE HAND 
ON THE TOP YOU SEE THE PAINTING WITH THE CORPSE LAYING ON A WHITE LINEN 
AS ONE WOULD EXPECT WHICH IS NORMAL A WHITE LINEN 
AND YOU SEE THE ARMS CROSSED AND YOU SEE THE FOUR FINGERS 
THE THUMB IS INVISIBLE IS HIDDEN AND THAT IS ALSO A CONNECTION 
IT'S ALSO VISIBLE THE SAME ON THE SHROUD 
LEMBERG IS ALSO VERY AWARE OF THE GEOMETRIC WEAVE OF THE SHROUD 
WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR A TEXTILE HISTORIAN AS I AM 
YOU SEE PAINTED A HERRINGBONE PATTERN 
AND THIS HERRINGBONE PATTERN IS A TYPICAL SIGN 
OF THE SHROUD OF TURIN 
ANOTHER FEATURE OF THE CLOTH ARE THE HOLES BUNCHED TOGETHER IN AN L. SHAPE 
THESE HOLES HERE THESE L. HOLES THEY ARE ON THIS PICTURE 
AND THEY ARE ON THE SHROUD FOUR TIMES 
BECAUSE IT WAS FOLDED IN FOUR LAYERS 
YOU SEE HERE SMALL HOLES A LITTLE BIT BIGGER 
AND THEN HERE YOU SEE THE BIGGER ONES OH I SEE 
THE PAINTER OF THIS PICTURE MUST HAVE SEEN THE SHROUD OF TURIN 
OTHERWISE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT'S EXACTLY THE SIGNS WHICH WE FIND ALSO ON THE SHROUD IN TURIN 
IF THE CARBON FOURTEEN TEST IS RIGHT 
AND THE TURIN SHROUD DATES TO THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
YOU WOULD NOT EXPECT TO FIND THE SAME ARRANGEMENT OF HOLES IN A SHROUD NEARLY TWO CENTURIES OLDER 
AND YET THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE PRAY MANUSCRIPT SHOWS 
SO IF THE SHROUD NOW IN TURIN WAS ONCE IN CONSTANTINOPLE WHAT WAS IT DOING THERE 
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHY DO WE NOT HEAR FROM IT AGAIN UNTIL ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY 
WELL THIS ISN'T ISTANBUL THE MODERN CONSTANTINOPLE IT'S OXFORD 
AND I'VE COME HERE TO SPEAK TO A MAN WHO HAS MADE THE STUDY OF CHRISTIAN SACRED IMAGES HIS LIFE'S WORK 
CONSTANTINOPLE HAD THE FINEST AND MOST PRIZED RELICS IN THE WORLD 
THIS IS A PIECE OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
PROFESSOR ALEXEI LIDOV HAS MADE A STUDY OF A RARE MEMOIR 
OF A FRENCH CRUSADER WHO HUNTED DOWN THESE RELICS AND GIVES US THIS INTRIGUING ACCOUNT 
IT IS SET IN CONSTANTINOPLE IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FOUR 
AROUND TEN YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF THE PRAY MANUSCRIPT 
AND IT MENTIONS A SHROUD OF CHRIST DISPLAYED IN SOME KIND OF CEREMONY 
IN WHICH THE SHROUD WITH ITS FIGURE OF CHRIST WAS RAISED UP EVERY FRIDAY 
I QUOTE 
AMONGST OTHERS THERE WAS ANOTHER OF THE CHURCHES 
CALLED OUR LADY SAINT MARY OF BLACHERNAE 
IN WHICH WAS THE SHROUD 
IN WHICH OUR LORD WAS WRAPPED AND WHICH STOOD UP STRAIGHT 
EVERY FRIDAY SO THAT THE IMAGE COULD BE CLEARLY SEEN ON IT 
WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THE IMAGE OR LE FIGURE WAS LIFTED UP 
A KIND OF RITE OR A SPECIAL RITUAL 
HAPPENED EVERY FRIDAY IN THE BLACHERNAE CHURCH 
RELATED TO THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE SHROUD OF CHRIST 
IT SEEMS TO ME VERY PROBABLE THAT THE CONSTANTINOPLE SHROUD 
AND THE SHROUD OF TURIN IS ONE AND THE SAME PIECE 
BECAUSE OF VERY RARE SIMILARITIES AND THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT EVIDENCE 
BY ROBERT DE CLARI THAT THERE WAS AN IMAGE OF CHRIST ON THE SHROUD 
AS FOR WHY WE DON'T HEAR OF THIS SHROUD AGAIN 
THE CRUSADER ROBERT DE CLARI TELLS US IN HIS MEMOIR THAT AT THE END OF THE FOURTH CRUSADE 
WHEN CONSTANTINOPLE WAS RANSACKED BY FRENCH CRUSADERS 
NO ONE KNEW WHAT BECAME OF THE SHROUD 
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE TURIN SHROUD'S FIRST RECORDED APPEARANCE 
IS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS LATER IN FRANCE IN THE HANDS OF A FAMILIAR FIGURE ONE GEOFFREY DE CHARNEY 
RECENT RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT HE WAS MARRIED TO A DIRECT DESCENDANT 
OF ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE FOURTH CRUSADE 
IF A FRENCH CRUSADER TOOK THE SHROUD FROM CONSTANTINOPLE 
IT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY WE ONLY HEAR FROM IT AGAIN IN THE HANDS HIS HEIRS 
BUT ALTHOUGH THE SHROUD DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY YEARS 
PROFESSOR LIDOV BELIEVES A MEMORY OF THE IMAGE ON THE SHROUD 
WAS PRESERVED IN THE ART OF THE PERIOD 
THIS ICON OF CHRIST IS KNOWN AS THE MAN OF SORROWS 
IT BECAME POPULAR IN CONSTANTINOPLE WHEN THE SHROUD DISAPPEARED 
IT HAS MANY OF THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE IMAGE 
ON THE SHROUD OF TURIN 
THE CROSSED ARMS THE HIDDEN THUMB 
AND SIGNIFICANTLY IT DEPICTS AN IMAGE OF CHRIST 
EMERGING OUT OF A BOX LIKE TOMB AS IF RAISED UP FROM THE DEAD 
MANY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF IT EXIST 
IT WAS CLEARLY A CELEBRATION OF THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS 
AND ALMOST CERTAINLY INVOKES THE RITUAL INVOLVING A SHROUD DESCRIBED BY THE CRUSADER ROBERT DE CLARY 
I WONDER IF ITS ORIGIN MIGHT BE CONNECTED WITH THE LOSS OF THE SHROUD IN SOME WAY 
I THINK SO IN A WAY WE MAY CONSIDER THIS AS A KIND OF COMPENSATION 
OF THIS GREAT LOSS AND THE COMMEMORATION OF THE PRESENCE OF THE SHROUD IN CONSTANTINOPLE 
THE PRAY MANUSCRIPT THE TESTIMONY OF THE ROBERT DE CLARY AND THE MAN OF SORROWS ICON 
ALL BUILD A COMPELLING CASE FOR THE SHROUD OF TURIN 
BEING OLDER THAN THE DATE SPECIFIED BY THE CARBON FOURTEEN TEST 
IT'S A CONTROVERSIAL CLAIM BUT IT SEEMS TO BE SUPPORTED 
BY AN INTRIGUING SERIES OF FEATURES NOW CLEARLY REVEALED BY HIGH DEFINITION IMAGES OF THE SHROUD 
WHEN LIT FROM THE SIDE THE SHROUD IMAGE ALL BUT DISAPPEARS 
AND FROM THE SHADOWS EMERGES ANOTHER DIMENSION THE CLOTH'S ACCUMULATED FOLDS 
WATCH AGAIN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE LIGHTING CHANGES 
NOTICE THE HORIZONTAL CREASES THE WHOLE WIDTH OF THE CLOTH 
LINEN HAS A KIND OF MEMORY 
IT CREASES AND IF IT'S KEPT FOLDED FOR LONG PERIODS 
THESE CREASES BECOME PERMANENT 
AND A RECORD OF HOW THE CLOTH HAS BEEN KEPT 
ACCORDING TO DOCTOR JACKSON IT'S DATA THAT CAN BE USED FORENSICALLY 
TO LINK THE MAN OF SORROWS ICON TO THE SHROUDS OF TURIN AND CONSTANTINOPLE 
DOCTOR JACKSON IDENTIFIED A SERIES OF FOLD MARKS AT REGULAR INTERVALS 
A B. C. AND D. THAT REFLECT THE WAY THE CLOTH WAS FOLDED DURING STORAGE 
HE EXPECTED THE PATTERN TO REPEAT ITSELF ALONG THE WHOLE CLOTH 
SURPRISINGLY IT DOESN'T 
THERE IS NO FOLD E. BETWEEN THE HEAD AND THE NAVEL 
INSTEAD JUST BELOW THE CROSSED HANDS JACKSON FOUND NO LESS THAN FOUR CLOSELY PACKED FOLDS 
GROUPED TOGETHER IN WHAT HE CALLS THE F. BLOCK 
FINALLY THE PATTERN SUGGESTED THAT THERE SHOULD BE A FOLD HERE BY THE LEGS 
AND SURE ENOUGH ON CLOSE INSPECTION THERE WAS BUT ODDLY IT WAS SHALLOWER THAN THE OTHERS 
JACKSON DEVELOPED A PROGRAMME TO SIMULATE ALL THE FOLDS 
AND CONCLUDED THAT THEY MUST HAVE COME FROM SOME KIND OF DEVICE PERHAPS FOR STORING THE SHROUD 
JACKSON LOOKED FOR CLUES IN THE MAN OF SORROWS ICON 
NOT ONLY DID IT DEPICT THE ONE AREA OF THE SHROUD THAT WAS FREE OF FOLD MARKS 
BUT IT WAS INVARIABLY SHOWN AS SOMETHING COMING OUT OF A BOX 
PERHAPS THE DEVICE THAT HAD FORMED THE FOLDS ALSO DISPLAYED THE SHROUD 
IN THE WAY DESCRIBED BY THE CRUSADER ROBERT DE CLARI 
I HAVE BEEN INVITED TO WITNESS THE UNVEILING OF A DEVICE DESIGNED AND BUILT BY JACKSON'S TEAM 
BASED ON THE FOLD MARK EVIDENCE AND THE CEREMONY WITNESSED IN CONSTANTINOPLE 
SO WHAT DOES THIS MACHINE DO AND HOW DOES IT POSSIBLY EXPLAIN WHERE THE FOLD MARKS ARE ON THE SHROUD 
WELL ALL OF THEM WERE CALCULATED AS TO EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE 
YOU REMEMBER THE F. BLOCK THE F. BLOCK IS THIS BLOCK HERE 
WITH THE FOUR FOLDS AROUND IT 
AND THEN WE HAD AN INTERESTING PROBLEM 
WE COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHY THERE WAS A MISSING FOLD 
SO THE SOLUTION WE CAME UP WITH WAS A WEIGHTED BAR 
IT DOES SOME MARVELLOUS THINGS FOR US 
FIRST OF ALL IT KEEPS THE FRONT OF THE SHROUD TAUT SO YOU ALWAYS HAVE 
A GOOD FACE THAT DOESN'T FLUFF LIKE A SAIL KEEPS IT TAUT YEAH 
THAT'S RIGHT AND THEN IT ALSO HAS A TENDENCY TO PULL THIS DOWN 
RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE F. BLOCK WHICH GIVES US THIS SHARP FOLD HERE 
SO IT ANSWERS TWO THINGS THE FACT THIS POLE BEING HERE 
WHY THERE IS NO FOLD MARK AT THAT POINT AND WHY THERE IS THIS F. BLOCK MARKS HERE 
THAT'S TRUE AND THEN WE ALSO SAW THAT VERY SHALLOW FOLD MARK THAT WE SAW BEFORE 
THAT SHALLOW FOLD MARK IS THIS FREE HANGING FOLD RIGHT THERE 
THIS YES THAT IS CORRECT 
THE TIME HAS COME TO DECIDE IF THIS ELABORATE HYPOTHESIS COULD BE TRUE 
THE BYZANTINES HAD A GREAT REPUTATION FOR CREATING SPECTACLE AND THEATRICAL LITURGY 
COULD THIS BE THE IMAGE OF CHRIST THAT WAS RAISED UP EVERY FRIDAY 
THAT ROBERT DE CLARI SAW IN CONSTANTINOPLE 
IN ANY OTHER FIELD OF HISTORICAL RESEARCH THIS WEALTH OF EVIDENCE 
TEXTILE DOCUMENTARY ARTISTIC AND FORENSIC 
WOULD BE ENOUGH TO CONCLUDE THAT THE SHROUDS OF TURIN AND CONSTANTINOPLE 
WERE ONE AND THE SAME 
BUT THE CARBON FOURTEEN TEST HAS CREATED A BARRIER 
THE SHROUD OF TURIN CANNOT BE OLDER 
PERHAPS IT'S TIME TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT CARBON FOURTEEN 
I'VE COME TO OXFORD SITE OF ONE OF THE THREE LABS 
WHICH CONDUCTED THE LANDMARK TESTS TWENTY YEARS AGO 
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE MARGIN OF ERROR OF PLUS OR MINUS SIXTY FIVE YEARS WAS WRONG 
SHOULD IT HAVE BEEN WIDER 
PROFESSOR CHRISTOPHER RAMSEY NOW RUNS THE OXFORD RADIOCARBON ACCELERATOR UNIT 
AND WAS PRESENT HERE WHEN THE ORIGINAL TEST WAS RUN ON THE SHROUD 
ANYTHING IS ALWAYS SOMEWHAT PROVISIONAL 
THERE ARE ALWAYS NEW EXPERIMENTS YOU CAN DO 
MOST SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS ARE ONLY VERIFIED BY BEING REPEATED MANY TIMES 
AND IF YOU CAN REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT AND DO IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY 
YOU GET THE SAME ANSWER YOU'RE CONVINCED 
WITH THE SHROUD YOU'RE IN A DIFFICULT POSITION BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GO ON DATING IT LOTS OF TIMES 
AS A SCIENTIST I'M MORE INTERESTED IN GETTING THE RIGHT ANSWER 
THAN I AM IN STICKING TO AN ANSWER WHICH WE CAME TO BEFORE 
MY OWN HUNCH AT THE MOMENT FROM THE WEIGHT OF SCIENTIFIC DATA 
AND OTHER DATA WOULD BE THAT THE SHROUD IS MEDIEVAL 
BUT I DON'T YOU KNOW I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK I WILL ALWAYS HOLD THAT 
AND I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO INQUIRIES THAT WOULD INDICATE OTHERWISE 
THERE IS AN ANOMALY 
THE EVIDENCE FROM PHYSICS IS SEEMINGLY AT ODDS WITH THAT FROM HISTORY 
BUT OF COURSE EVEN IF IT COULD BE PROVEN BEYOND DOUBT 
THAT THE SHROUDS OF TURIN AND CONSTANTINOPLE WERE ONE AND THE SAME 
THAT STILL WOULDN'T MAKE IT AUTHENTIC 
AFTER ALL TRADITION CLAIMS THAT THE SHROUD OF TURIN IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE BURIAL CLOTH OF CHRIST 
EVEN THE TWELFTH CENTURY IS STILL ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE DEATH OF JESUS 
BUT PRESSURE ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE CARBON FOURTEEN TEST HAS CONTINUED TO BUILD 
WITH NEW FORENSIC EVIDENCE THAT PLACES THE SHROUD YET FURTHER BACK IN TIME 
IT IS SOMETHING KNOWN AS THE SUDARIUM OF OVIEDO IN SPAIN 
IT'S REPUTED TO BE THE FACE CLOTH MENTIONED IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN 
JOHN SAYS THAT THE DISCIPLES ENTERED THE TOMB OF JESUS 
ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER HIS DEATH ONLY TO FIND IT EMPTY 
APART FROM THE BURIAL CLOTH AND THE FACE CLOTH 
WE ALSO KNOW FROM OFFICIAL RECORDS IN OVIEDO THAT THE SUDARIUM 
CAN BE ACCURATELY DATED TO THE FIFTH CENTURY AD 
I'VE INVITED TO TURIN MARK GUSCIN AN EXPERT ON THE SUDARIUM OF OVIEDO IN SPAIN 
HIS EVIDENCE COULD PUSH THE DATE OF THE TURIN SHROUD BACK ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS TO THE FIFTH CENTURY 
THIS IS AN IDENTICAL COPY OF THE SUDARIUM 
ITS PURPOSE WAS TO TRAP BLOOD ESCAPING FROM THE CORPSE AS IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FOR BURIAL 
GUSCIN BELIEVES HE'S IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE LINKING THE SUDARIUM TO THE SHROUD OF TURIN 
GUSCIN ALREADY KNEW THAT THE SHROUD HAS REAL BLOOD 
IT BELONGS TO THE RARE GROUP A. B. 
THERE ARE ALSO TRACES OF BLOOD SHED IN LIFE AND BLOOD SHED IN DEATH 
AND FINALLY THERE ARE THE UNMISTAKEABLE TRACES OF BLOOD 
FROM A CROWN OF THORNS ON THE FRONT OF THE HEAD AND THE BACK 
GUSCIN BELIEVES ALL THREE BLOOD FEATURES CAN BE FOUND ON THE SUDARIUM 
THE FIRST IS THE BLOOD GROUP 
WHICH IS A RELATIVELY RARE BLOOD GROUP 
IT'S THE BLOOD GROUP A. B. 
AND IT'S THE SAME BLOOD GROUP OF HUMAN BLOOD ON BOTH CLOTHS 
THEN THERE IS THE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN LIFE BLOOD BLOOD SHED IN LIFE 
AND POST MORTEM BLOOD WHICH CAN BE CLEARLY DIFFERENTIATED 
AND AGAIN THAT COINCIDES ON BOTH CLOTHS 
AND THAT BRINGS US TO WHAT FOR ME CLINCHES THE WHOLE MATTER OF THE CLOTHS BEING USED ON THE SAME BODY 
THIS WAS BLOOD SHED IN LIFE WHILE THE MAN IN QUESTION WAS STILL ALIVE 
THIS BLOOD COMES FROM WOUNDS THAT WERE MADE BY SOME KIND OF SHARP OBJECT 
PIERCING THE SKIN IN THIS AREA OF THE NAPE OF THE NECK 
O. K. PERFECTLY COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED SINCE THEN A CROWN OF THORNS O. K. 
NOW IF WE LOOK AT THIS WE HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME STAINS IN THE SAME AREA ON THE SHROUD OF TURIN 
NOW THE ACTUAL SHAPE OF THE STAINS IF YOU DO AN OVERLAY OF THE TWO 
THE ACTUAL SHAPE THE WAY THE BLOOD FLOWED COINCIDES ON BOTH CLOTHS 
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS NOT ONLY THE BLOOD TYPES ARE THE SAME 
THE ACTUAL PATTERNS OF THE BLOOD ON BOTH CLOTHS CAN BE MATCHED 
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S EXACTLY SO WHICH HAS LED MORE THAN ONE FORENSIC QUALIFIED FORENSIC DOCTOR TO SAY 
THAT THE ONLY CONCLUSION YOU CAN MAKE FROM THAT IS THAT BOTH CLOTHS WERE USED ON THE SAME BODY 
IN OTHER WORDS IT'S TOO MUCH FOR A SIMPLE COINCIDENCE 
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT 
THE FACT THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SUDARIUM IN ITS HISTORY HAS HUGE IMPLICATIONS 
FOR THE SHROUD BECAUSE THEY BOTH COVERED THE SAME MAN YES 
AND THE ONLY PLACE THEY COULD HAVE COINCIDED BOTH IN TIME 
WAS IN JERUSALEM SOME TIME BEFORE THE FOURTH OR THE FIFTH CENTURY 
THERE'S NO TWO WAYS ABOUT THAT 
THEY COULDN'T HAVE COINCIDED AT ANY TIME AFTER THAT 
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SUDARIUM WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THE SUDARIUM WAS ALL THE TIME 
THESE VERY DISTINCTIVE WOUNDS ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD ON THE SHROUD 
LINK IT TO THE SUDARIUM IN JERUSALEM BEFORE FIVE HUNDRED AD 
THE TURIN SHROUD'S LINKS WITH THE SHROUD OF CONSTANTINOPLE 
PUSHED ITS DATE BACK NEARLY TWO CENTURIES 
ITS LINKS WITH THE SUDARIUM OF OVIEDO 
PUSH IT BACK BY ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS 
TO BE SURE NONE OF THESE LINKS NECESSARILY MAKE IT THE TRUE SHROUD OF CHRIST 
IT MIGHT BE THAT IT'S A FIFTH CENTURY FAKE 
BUT THERE IS A THIRD SHROUD THE ONE DESCRIBED IN THE GOSPELS 
WHICH WRAPPED THE BODY OF CHRIST IN JERUSALEM AFTER HIS CRUCIFIXION 
COULD THE SHROUD OF TURIN BE THAT SHROUD 
THAT WOULD BE THE MOST CONTENTIOUS CONNECTION OF ALL 
FOR IT WOULD MAKE THE DATE OF THE SHROUD OF TURIN 
ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED YEARS OLDER THAN THE DATE INDICATED BY THE CARBON FOURTEEN TEST 
AND YET THAT'S WHAT NEW FINDINGS IN COLORADO ARE HINTING AT 
THE TEAM STUDYING THE SHROUD OF TURIN HAVE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF LINKS TO THE SHROUD OF JERUSALEM 
FIRST CENTURY JEWISH BURIAL CLOTHS AS TODAY HAD TO CONFORM TO STRICT JEWISH RULES AND REGULATIONS 
FIRST THEY HAD TO BE LINEN UNCONTAMINATED BY WOOL 
REBECCA JACKSON IS JEWISH HERSELF AND SHE'S FOUND THAT THE CLOTH USED 
FOR THE SHROUD OF TURIN CONFORMS PRECISELY 
ACCORDING TO JEWISH LAW 
YOU CANNOT MIX LINEN AND WOOL IN THE SAME FABRIC THAT WILL BE TOUCHED 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY ILLEGAL 
AND THAT GOES WAY BACK INTO EGYPTIAN CULTURE THE TEMPLE LAWS OF ANCIENT EGYPT 
AND THE SHROUD IS DEFINITELY LINEN WITH SOME TRACES OF COTTON THAT COULD HAVE SLIPPED IN THERE 
BUT THAT'S FINE AND THAT'S O. K. THAT'S O. K. 
YOU CAN MIX LINEN AND COTTON FOR EVER AND EVER BUT YOU CAN'T MIX LINEN AND WOOL 
REBECCA JACKSON TOLD ME OF ANOTHER VERY SPECIFIC LINK WITH JEWISH CULTURE 
THIS IS ONE CUBIT 
AND THIS IS TWO CUBITS 
O. K. SO THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN USED AS A TOOL OF MEASUREMENT RIGHT 
SO LET'S CHECK IT OUT 
THAT'S TWO CUBITS IN WIDTH 
AND ACROSS 
THAT'S ONE 
THE POINT THERE THREE 
THE SHROUD'S DIMENSIONS ARE IN THE UNITS USED IN JERUSALEM AT THE TIME OF CHRIST THE CUBIT 
WHAT DOES THAT SUGGEST TO YOU 
THE WHOLE THING CHECKS OUT IN TERMS OF THE MEASUREMENT OF THE SHROUD IN THE CUBIT 
THE SHROUD HAS MANY OF THE HALLMARKS OF A JEWISH BURIAL CLOTH 
AND DOCTOR JACKSON BELIEVES THERE IS EVIDENCE 
THAT CONNECTS THE SHROUD DIRECTLY TO THE SHROUD IN THE GOSPELS 
THE MOST DETAILED ACCOUNT OF WHAT THE DISCIPLES SAW IN THE EMPTY TOMB IS THE GOSPEL OF JOHN 
HE MENTIONS THE FACE CLOTH 
BUT HE ALSO MENTIONS BURIAL CLOTHS IN THE PLURAL 
THAT MUST INCLUDE THE SHROUD THAT WRAPPED THE CORPSE 
BUT THE PLURAL INDICATES THAT THERE WAS YET ANOTHER CLOTH AND THAT HAS PUZZLED NEW TESTAMENT SCHOLARS 
WELL JACKSON BELIEVES HE HAS IDENTIFIED THE OTHER CLOTH 
IN THE SHROUD ITSELF 
IN A STRIP OF CLOTH SEWN ALONG ONE SIDE 
THIS IS A TRANSMITTED IMAGED IT'S A TRANSMITTED LIGHT IMAGE AN ABSORPTION IMAGE 
JACKSON OWNS THIS BACKLIT IMAGE OF THE SHROUD TAKEN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT 
AND IT SHOWS CLEARLY THAT THE BANDS OF DISCOLOURATION FROM THE WEAVING 
GO RIGHT THROUGH THE SEAM FROM THE MAIN CLOTH TO THE STRIP 
SHOWING THAT IT WAS PART OF THE ORIGINAL CLOTH THEN TORN OFF AND THEN RESEWN BACK ON AGAIN 
COULD THIS SIDE STRIP BE THE MISSING CLOTH ALLUDED TO IN JOHN'S GOSPEL 
HERE'S THE SIDE STRIP ON THE SHROUD 
LET ME JUST SHOW YOU THAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY THE LENGTH OF THE ACTUAL SHROUD ITSELF O. K. RIGHT 
SO WE'RE GOING TO USE THIS TO FINISH OFF WHAT I'M PROPOSING TO 
EXPLAINS THAT MOVEMENT OF THE CLOTH 
NOW REMEMBER THE BOTTOM OF THE FEET HAVE BLOOD ON THEM AND SO THAT HAS TO BE HELD IN PLACE 
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE THE BOTTOM PART 
SO LET'S PUT A SMALL KNOT HERE AT THE BOTTOM 
AND WE'RE GOING TO WRAP THIS AROUND 
AND MAKE IT RATHER TIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HOLD THE BODY TOGETHER 
SO THAT'S THE BIT THAT WOULD HAVE HELD THE KNEES TOGETHER 
THAT'S GOING TO HOLD THE LEGS TOGETHER WHICH HOLDS THE KNEES AS WE OBSERVE ON THE SHROUD 
THE WAY THE STRIP FASTENS THE CLOTH AROUND THE BODY 
CONFORMS TO THE WAY THE BODY IS REPRESENTED ON THE SHROUD 
LOOK HERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CHIN 
NOTICE THE DISRUPTION THAT OCCURS IN THE CLOTH 
I THINK WE CAN SEE THAT ECHOED IF WE GO OVER HERE AND VIEW THE NEGATIVE IMAGE 
WE CAN SEE THE HAIR ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FACE 
BUT WHEN WE GET DOWN IT LOOKS LIKE THE HAIR SUDDENLY THERE'S A DISRUPTION 
AT LEAST TO MY EYE 
OVER HERE I THINK THERE'S ALSO A DISRUPTION IN THE BEARD THERE'S SOMETHING HERE 
AND I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE ARE INDUCING 
BY FOLDING ON THE CLOTH HERE 
JACKSON'S SIDE STRIP THEORY COULD ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT'S PUZZLED STUDENTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT 
I ASKED JACKSON IF HE WOULD SUBMIT HIS SOLUTION TO AN EXPERT ON JOHN'S GOSPEL 
IN A REAL FIRST CENTURY TOMB IN JERUSALEM ITSELF 
I'VE ARRANGED FOR DOCTOR JACKSON TO PRESENT HIS THEORY 
TO DOCTOR STEPHEN NEED A NEW TESTAMENT SCHOLAR 
THIS IS JUST THE SORT OF TOMB THAT'S REFERRED TO 
JACKSON HAS LAID OUT THE BODY IN THE TOMB 
WRAPPED ACCORDING TO HIS RECONSTRUCTION FROM THE SHROUD 
COMPLETE WITH THE TORN OFF SIDESTRIP TIED AROUND IT 
FOR ACCURACY THE SUDARIUM OR FACE CLOTH THAT JOHN'S GOSPEL DESCRIBES IS ALSO IN POSITION 
THEN JUST BEFORE DOCTOR NEED'S ARRIVAL THE BODY IS REMOVED TO LEAVE JUST THE CLOTHS 
IT'S VERY STRIKING TO COME INTO A REAL TOMB IN JERUSALEM AND TO SEE THE CLOTHES LYING THERE LIKE THAT 
IT FITS IN WITH THE JOHANINE PICTURE 
IF THAT PIECE OF CLOTH THAT WAS TORN OFF AT THE TIME OF THE BURIAL 
WAS INDEED A SEPARATE PIECE OF CLOTH THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE PLURAL 
IF JACKSON IS RIGHT THEN THIS ARRANGEMENT OF BURIAL CLOTHS 
MAY BE A CLOSER REPRESENTATION OF WHAT JOHN'S GOSPEL SAYS THE DISCIPLES SAW 
WHEN THEY WALKED INTO THE TOMB ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER JESUS'S DEATH 
THE SIDE STRIP LINKS THE SHROUD OF TURIN TO THE GOSPEL OF JOHN AND THE FIRST CENTURY AD 
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST DIRECT EVIDENCE LINKING THE SHROUD OF TURIN TO THE TIME OF JESUS 
IS AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND MADE IN JERUSALEM ITSELF 
I'VE COME TO THE ISRAEL MUSEUM TO HEAR ABOUT A DISCOVERY MADE IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNEARTHED THE REMAINS OF A VICTIM OF ROMAN CRUCIFIXION DATING FROM THE TIME OF JESUS 
THE RELEVANT FIND WAS A SINGLE HEEL BONE WHICH CHALLENGED THE WAY WE IMAGINED CRUCIFIXION 
AND THE MUSEUM HAS AGREED TO LET ME SEE IT 
WHAT ELLI HAS JUST BEEN HANDED TO ME 
IS THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE OF THE VICTIM OF A CRUCIFIXION 
THE KEY THING IS THAT THIS NAIL DID NOT GO THROUGH THE FRONT OF THE FOOT BUT THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE HEEL 
GROOVES ON THE VICTIM'S ULNA BONE SHOW THAT HE WAS NAILED THROUGH THE WRISTS 
THESE FINDS OVERTURN THE CONVENTION 
THAT JESUS WAS NAILED THROUGH THE FRONT OF THE FEET AND HIS PALMS 
AND SO THEY ARE A BENCHMARK FOR THE TRUE AGE OF THE SHROUD 
CRUCIFIXION DISAPPEARED ALONG WITH THE ROMAN EMPIRE 
LATER ARTISTS SHOW THE NAILS GOING THROUGH THE FRONT OF THE FEET AND THE PALMS 
I WOULD EXPECT A MEDIAEVAL FORGER TO HAVE FOLLOWED THE SAME CONVENTION 
BUT IF THE METHOD OF CRUCIFIXION IS DISTINCTLY ROMAN 
THEN IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BE FROM THE TIME OF JESUS 
I'VE ASKED TWO SPECIALISTS PETER DEAN A FORENSIC MEDICAL EXAMINER 
AND DOCTOR NIELS SVENSSON AN EXPERT ON THE SHROUD 
TO ASSESS WHETHER THE TYPE OF CRUCIFIXION REPRESENTED ON THE IMAGE 
CONFORMS TO CHRISTIAN ICONOGRAPHY OR TO ROMAN METHODS OF EXECUTION 
THERE ARE THE WOUNDS YOU WOULD EXPECT TO FIND FROM THE DESCRIPTIONS IN THE GOSPELS 
THE SCOURGING FOR EXAMPLE 
THE SHAPE AND SIZE MATCH ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES 
OF THE FLAGRUM FAVOURED BY THE ROMANS IN THE FIRST CENTURY 
LIKEWISE THE WOUND IN THE SIDE MATCHES THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE ROMAN LANCE 
BUT FOR DOCTOR SVENSSON THE MOST TELLING DETAILS ARE THE WOUNDS WHERE THE BODY WAS NAILED TO THE CROSS 
A ROMAN CRUCIFIXION BEGAN WITH FIXING THE ARMS AT THE CROSS BEAM 
CALLED THE VERTIBULUM 
AND IF WE LOOK AT THE MAN IN THE SHROUD 
WE SEE HERE AT THE WRISTS 
A BIG WOUND WITH BLOOD RIVULETS IN TWO DIRECTIONS 
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE 
WHEN ONE THINKS OF THE NORMAL PICTURES OR REPRESENTATIONS 
ONE IS USED TO SEEING PICTURES OF A NAIL THROUGH THE PALM ITSELF 
BUT HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BACK SURFACE OF THE WRIST RATHER THAN THE PALMS 
YOU GET MUCH MORE SUPPORT IF YOU GO THROUGH THE BONY STRUCTURES OF THE WRIST RATHER THAN 
THE SOFT TISSUE IN THE PALM WHICH MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY CAPABLE OF BEARING WEIGHT 
THE WOUNDS ON THE FEET ALSO CONFIRM THAT THIS WAS A ROMAN CRUCIFIXION 
THE ROMANS CRUCIFY THEIR VICTIMS BY NAILING THEM THROUGH THE HEEL 
AND THIS MAN WAS PIERCED BY THE HEEL 
BECAUSE WE SEE A LARGE OUTFLOW OF BLOOD FROM HERE 
THE BLOOD STAINS ON THE SHROUD ARE CONSISTENT WITH 
THIS PRACTICAL WAY OF NAILING THE WAY WE NOW KNOW TO BE THE ROMAN WAY 
SO NO ONE HAS YET WORKED OUT HOW THE IMAGE WAS FORMED 
AND THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT PLACES THE SHROUD EARLIER IN TIME 
IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
IN THE FIFTH CENTURY 
AND EVEN IN THE FIRST CENTURY 
THE CONFLICT OF EVIDENCE IS SUCH THAT THE TEAM IN COLORADO IS ASKING 
WHETHER THE RESULTS OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CARBON FOURTEEN TEST COULD HAVE BEEN DISTORTED 
UP THERE IN THE STRATOSPHERE IS WHERE THE CARBON FOURTEEN ISOTOPE IS CREATED 
AS THE COSMIC RAYS HIT THE ATMOSPHERE 
AND SINCE THE SHROUD WAS TESTED TWENTY YEARS AGO 
MORE IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS TRANSITION FROM THERE TO THE PLANTS FROM WHICH THE LINEN IS MADE 
BASED ON THIS NEW KNOWLEDGE JACKSON AND HIS TEAM HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW HYPOTHESIS THAT COULD EXPLAIN WHY 
THE AGE OF THE SHROUD SAMPLE TESTED TWENTY YEARS AGO IS YOUNGER THAN THE REST OF THE EVIDENCE WOULD SUGGEST 
SCIENTISTS HAVE NOW DISCOVERED THAT BEFORE IT'S ABSORBED INTO CARBON DIOXIDE THE CARBON FOURTEEN ISOTOPE 
ACTUALLY SPENDS UP TO TWO MONTHS IN THE ATMOSPHERE AS CARBON MONOXIDE 
IF THE CARBON MONOXIDE BONDED WITH THE LINEN OF THE SHROUD IT COULD HAVE MADE THE CLOTH APPEAR YOUNGER 
IN FACT A TWO PER CENT CONTAMINATION IS ALL IT WOULD TAKE 
TO DISTORT THE AGE OF THE CLOTH BY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED YEARS 
SO LET ME UNDERSTAND YOU IN LAYMAN'S TERMS RIGHT 
IF YOU CAN ESTABLISH HERE THAT THERE HAS BEEN THIS CONTAMINATION 
OF THE MATERIAL IT WOULD MEAN THAT THE SHROUD OR THE MATERIAL 
WOULD HAVE BEEN THEREFORE DATED MUCH EARLIER THAN IT ACTUALLY IS 
IT WOULD MEAN THAT THE RADIOCARBON DATING OF THE SHROUD 
WOULD HAVE DATED A CONTAMINATED SAMPLE 
THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THE RADIOCARBON DATE WAS INCORRECT 
THE TEAM IS NOW GETTING READY TO BEGIN THE LONG PROCESS OF TESTING THE NEW HYPOTHESIS 
USING SAMPLES OF MODERN LINEN THE TEAM PLAN TO CARRY OUT A SERIES 
OF TESTS TO FIND OUT WHETHER ITS TRUE AGE CAN BE DISTORTED 
THE EXPERIMENTS WILL TAKE SOME TIME 
THEY NEED TO SUBMIT THE SAMPLES TO ALL THE POSSIBLE CONDITIONS 
THAT THE SHROUD OF TURIN ITSELF COULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO 
ITS STORAGE EXTREME HEAT ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT HANDLING WATER AND SO ON 
THE TESTS COULD HELP RESOLVE THE ANOMALY AT THE HEART OF THE STUDY OF THE SHROUD 
THE TIME HAS COME TO ASK PROFESSOR CHRISTOPHER RAMSEY AT THE OXFORD RADIOCARBON UNIT 
IF THE HYPOTHESES WHICH JOHN JACKSON HAS COME UP WITH DO HAVE ANY VALIDITY SCIENTIFICALLY 
IF THEY DO STAND UP TO EXPERIMENT THEY'LL HAVE MUCH WIDER IMPLICATIONS 
FOR OTHER SAMPLES WHICH MIGHT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS 
SO YOU KNOW IT'S PART OF THE SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY TO CONTINUE 
TO INVESTIGATE POSSIBLE WAYS OF IMPROVING THE TECHNIQUES AND SO ON 
THE OXFORD LABORATORY HAS AGREED TO TEST THE SAMPLES BEING PREPARED BY JACKSON'S TEAM 
AND THE FIRST BATCH OF SAMPLES OF LINEN IN NORMAL STORAGE CONDITIONS 
IS READY FOR PROFESSOR RAMSEY TO TEST 
HOW HAVE THESE PRELIMINARY SAMPLES TESTED 
AND DOES PROFESSOR RAMSEY FEEL THERE IS ANY FUTURE FOR THIS INVESTIGATION 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PARTICULAR HYPOTHESIS FOR CONTAMINATION WAS 
THAT IT'S THE FIRST THAT'S HAD THE CAPABILITY AT LEAST IN PRINCIPLE 
OF SHIFTING THE DATE BY A VERY LARGE AMOUNT 
WITHOUT VERY MUCH CONTAMINATION 
SO THAT'S WHY WE WERE DOING THESE EXPERIMENTS 
TO TRY TO SEE IF CARBON MONOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE WOULD REACT WITH LINEN 
IN THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE FOR THIS HYPOTHESIS TO WORK 
THE SAMPLES THAT WE'VE HAD SO FAR WHICH HAVE BEEN IN FAIRLY SORT OF 
NORMAL CONDITIONS HEATED LINEN AND STORED WITH CARBON MONOXIDE 
WE HAVEN'T YET SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OF REACTION BETWEEN THE CARBON MONOXIDE AND THE LINEN 
SO SO FAR THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS HYPOTHESIS 
THAT WOULD APPEAR TO UNDERMINE THE ORIGINAL RADIOCARBON DATING MEASUREMENTS 
SO THE QUESTION IS IS THERE SOMETHING VERY PARTICULAR 
ABOUT THE SHROUD ITSELF AND THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH IT'S BEEN STORED 
WHICH MAKES THOSE REACTIONS MANY TENS OF THOUSANDS TIMES FASTER 
THAN WE CAN REGISTER WITH THE MATERIAL WE HAVE SO FAR 
SO I GUESS THE SEARCH IS ON TO SEE IF THAT'S THE CASE 
WITH THE RADIOCARBON MEASUREMENTS AND WITH ALL OF THE OTHER EVIDENCE WHICH WE HAVE ABOUT THE SHROUD 
THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A CONFLICT IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE DIFFERENT EVIDENCE 
AND FOR THAT REASON I THINK THAT EVERYONE WHO'S WORKED IN THIS AREA 
RADIOCARBON SCIENTISTS AND ALL OF THE OTHER EXPERTS NEED TO HAVE A CRITICAL LOOK 
AT THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY'VE COME UP WITH IN ORDER FOR US TO TRY TO WORK OUT SOME KIND OF A COHERENT STORY 
THAT FITS AND TELLS US THE TRUTH OF THE HISTORY OF THIS INTRIGUING CLOTH 
WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THE NEW TESTS NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SHROUD WILL EMERGE 
COULD ITS IMAGE BE THE WORK OF AN ARTIST FROM AN EARLIER AGE 
OR COULD IT HAVE WRAPPED THE CORPSE OF CHRIST 
WHAT DID HAPPEN TO THE SHROUDS WE KNOW EXISTED IN THE FIRST FIFTH AND TWELFTH CENTURIES 
AND HOW WAS THE IMAGE ON THE CLOTH FORMED 
THE MYSTERIES LINGER ON 
THERE ARE THINGS 
WAITING IN THE DARKNESS 
CREATURES OF METAL AND FIRE AND BLOOD 
BUT HE'S OUT THERE BURNING THROUGH TIME 
FACING A THOUSAND DANGERS ACROSS THE STARS AND NEVER GIVING UP 
HE LOOKS LIKE A MAN BUT HE'S A LEGEND AND HIS NAME 
IS THE DOCTOR 
HE'LL COME BACK TO SAVE US 
AND THIS TIME I'M GONNA BE READY 
THEN JUST LIKE THAT 
WE'LL BE GONE
