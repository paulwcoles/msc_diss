ONE TUESDAY MORNING 
MR. FORTESCUE LEFT HIS HOUSE TO GO TO A BARBECUE 
IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY AND A GOOD OPPORTUNITY 
FOR HIM TO WEAR HIS STRAW HAT 
HE HURRIED ALONG THE AVENUE TO THE BUS STOP 
WHERE HE KNEW THERE WOULD BE A LONG QUEUE 
AS HE TURNED INTO DUEL LANE 
A LIGHT GUST OF WIND SUDDENLY BLEW HIS HAT AWAY 
MR. FORTESCUE WAS UPSET 
HE COULDN'T SEE WHERE HIS HAT HAD LANDED 
MRS. AGNEW FROM THE BUS QUEUE CALLED TO MR. FORTESCUE 
IS THAT YOURS SHE SAID 
HE LOOKED UP AND THERE 
RIGHT ON TOP OF THE HEAD OF GENERAL BARTHOLOMEW 
WAS HIS OLD STRAW HAT 
THE PEOPLE IN THE BUS QUEUE STARTED TO ARGUE 
YOU'LL WANT TO GET THAT DOWN SAID PRUE 
IT MIGHT BLOW RIGHT ACROSS TOWN SAID SUE 
THE GENERAL'S NOT A CLOWN SAID DREW 
JUST THEN STU TURNED THE CORNER FROM THE AVENUE 
AND AS USUAL WAS CARRYING HIS SNOOKER CUE 
WHY IS THAT STATUE WEARING A HAT HE JEERED 
IT REALLY DOESN'T SUIT HIM 
IT'S MINE SAID MR. FORTESCUE 
IT JUST BLEW OFF MY HEAD 
AND I'M TRYING TO GET TO A BARBECUE 
NOT TO WORRY SAID STU I KNOW WHAT TO DO 
I'LL COME TO YOUR RESCUE 
HE TOOK HIS SNOOKER CUE 
CLIMBED THE BASE OF THE OLD STATUTE 
AND KNOCKED THE HAT OFF GENERAL BARTHOLOMEW 
MR. FORTESCUE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH STU 
HE LET HIM TAKE HIS PLACE IN THE LONG BUS QUEUE 
THEN CONTINUED ON HIS WAY TO THE BARBECUE
