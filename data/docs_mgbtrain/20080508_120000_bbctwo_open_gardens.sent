EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF BRITISH GARDENERS TRY DESPERATELY TO GET A PLACE IN THE YELLOW BOOK 
PUBLISHED ANNUALLY BY THE NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME IT LISTS PRIVATE GARDENS OF SUCH A HIGH STANDARD 
THEY CAN OPEN THEIR GATES FOR CHARITY 
THOSE ACCEPTED INTO THE YELLOW BOOK WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO OPEN THEIR GARDENS TO THE PAYING PUBLIC 
BUT OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED WHO APPLY YEARLY ONLY HALF GET THROUGH 
THE STANDARDS ARE HIGH AND THE ASSESSING RUTHLESS 
AT THE MOMENT THERE'S NO INTEREST WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
THIS IS RATHER A MONSTROSITY I'M SAYING NO 
IT'S NO FOR THIS YEAR I'M GOING TO SAY NO 
I'LL BE FOLLOWING AVID GARDENERS STRIVING TO TURN THEIR PRIVATE PARADISES INTO OPEN GARDENS 
TODAY I'M GOING TO BE MEETING TWO PEOPLE WHO HOPE THEIR GARDEN WILL MAKE THE GRADE 
MY GARDEN MEANS A LOT TO ME I LIKE GETTING MY HANDS DIRTY 
IT WOULD BE GREAT TO BE ACCEPTED BY THE N. G.S THE STANDARDS ARE HIGH 
SO IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC BUT WILL TODAY'S GARDENS HAVE WHAT IT TAKES FOR THE YELLOW BOOK 
TODAY'S FIRST GARDEN IS IN THE HEART OF RURAL KENT 
IT'S A PICTURE POSTCARD COTTAGE THAT DATES BACK TO THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS 
IT'S GOT A WONDERFUL COTTAGE GARDEN WITH SHADY SPACES AND OPEN PLACES 
AND A WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF MATURE TREES 
THIS HISTORICAL HAVEN BELONGS TO THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD CATHRYN DRAPER 
FOR THREE YEARS SHE HAS SPENT MUCH OF HER PRECIOUS SPARE TIME WORKING HARD HERE 
TO RESTORE IT TO ITS FORMER YELLOW BOOK GLORY 
THE GARDEN WAS OPENED BACK IN NINETY SEVEN AND WE KNOW THAT IT MUST HAVE MET SOME REALLY STRICT CRITERIA 
SO WE HOPE WE MEET THE SAME LEVEL WE'VE GOT A LOT TO LIVE UP TO 
THIS THREE QUARTERS ACRE SOUTH FACING COUNTRY GARDEN IS PACKED FULL OF MATURE TREES AND WALKWAYS 
THROUGH PICTURESQUE ARBORS BUT THESE AREN'T THE ONLY RELICS 
THERE'S AN ANDERSON AIR RAID SHELTER FORMING THE BASE OF A ROCKERY 
TWO OVERGROWN WILDLIFE PONDS AND A VEGETABLE PATCH 
I SEE THE GARDEN AS A BIT OF A HAVEN IT'S A COMPLETE CONTRAST TO WHAT I DO EVERY DAY 
TO CHILL OUT HERE IS GREAT IN SUMMER WITH A GLASS OF WINE IT'S JUST THE MOST RELAXING THING 
CATHRYN'S HAD HELP IN THE GARDEN FROM HER FATHER IN LAW DAVID 
IT MEANS AN AWFUL LOT TO HER 
I THINK IT WAS THE PRINCIPAL REASON FOR BUYING THE HOUSE 
THE HOUSE IS WONDERFUL BUT THE GARDEN WAS SPECIAL TO HER AND SHE COULD EXPRESS HERSELF 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S PHYSICALLY QUITE HARD WORK AND USUALLY BY SUNDAY EVENING I'M QUITE WORN OUT 
I CAN DO WHAT I WANT TO DO NOBODY NEEDS ME TO DO ANYTHING 
AND I CAN LISTEN TO THE BIRDS LOOK AT THE GARDEN NOTHING ELSE GIVES ME THAT SENSE OF SATISFACTION 
OR ACHIEVEMENT AT THE END OF THE DAY 
WHEN DID YOUR LOVE OF GARDENING FIRST START I GUESS FROM MY PARENTS MUM WAS AN AVID GARDENER 
MY GRANDDAD HAD AN ALLOTMENT UNTIL HE WAS ABOUT NINETY SO A LOT OF GARDENING HISTORY 
THIS GARDEN'S BEEN IN THE YELLOW BOOK BEFORE YES DOES THAT GIVE YOU CONFIDENCE OR MAKE YOU MORE NERVOUS 
IN SOME WAYS IT'S A GOOD THING AT LEAST THERE IS SOME HISTORY OF THAT IT'S BEEN OPEN BEFORE 
SO IT'S NOT STARTING FROM SCRATCH 
THIS GARDEN MAY BE BEAUTIFUL HOWEVER THERE ARE A COUPLE OF MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH IT 
THESE TWO PONDS ARE SERIOUSLY OVERGROWN AND A BIT SMELLY 
AND THIS HANDRAIL WELL THAT'S A SAFETY HAZARD THE N. G.S WILL BE REALLY HOT ON THESE 
IT COULD PREVENT CATHRYN FROM GETTING INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER CATHRYN'S GARDEN MAKES THE MARK LIES WITH COUNTY ORGANISER FELICITY WARD 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT SOMETHING WELCOMING 
SOMETHING THAT SAYS COME IN COME AND SEE WHAT'S ROUND THE NEXT CORNER 
SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES PEOPLE TO WALK THROUGH 
FELICITY HAS EXACTING STANDARDS WITH CATHRYN'S ASSESSMENT ONLY DAYS AWAY HER FATE LOOKS DOUBTFUL 
OUR SECOND GARDEN TODAY IS IN SUSSEX ALTHOUGH YOU MAY BE FORGIVEN FOR THINKING YOU'RE FURTHER AFIELD 
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS JAPANESE STYLE GARDEN BUILT ON A GRAND SCALE 
IT'S GOT THIS WONDERFUL ROCKERY THE PLANTING'S ACERS CAMELLIAS RHODODENDRONS WHAT YOU'D EXPECT 
AND THERE'S THIS FABULOUS WATERFALL AND EVEN A BIG LAKE 
THE WHOLE GARDEN CONTRASTS WITH THIS TUDOR HOUSE NOT BAD FOR A WEEKEND PAD EH 
THESE EXQUISITE JAPANESE INSPIRED GARDENS BELONG TO SIXTY YEAR OLD ADELE SPEELMAN 
ADELE AND HER HUSBAND RUN A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IN LONDON AND CAXTON MANOR'S BEEN THEIR GETAWAY 
FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
MY GARDEN MEANS A LOT TO ME IT MEANS TRANQUILLITY 
I LIKE GETTING MY FINGERS DIRTY 
IT'S THE ONE THING I REALLY ENJOY DOING 
IT KEEPS ME FIT KEEPS MY MIND FIT 
I LOVE IT IT MEANS A LOT TO ME 
THE THREE ACRES OF GARDEN ARE A REAL FUSION OF EAST MEETS WEST 
BY THE HOUSE IS A NEWLY CREATED ELIZABETHAN PARTERRE 
LEADING TO A WOODLAND WALK INTO THE JAPANESE GARDENS 
WITH AN ENORMOUS WATERFALL A LAKE WITH A BRIDGE AND A VAST EXPANSE OF LAWN 
GARDENING IS NEVER NEVER BORING THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ON A DAILY BASIS 
AND BECAUSE I'M A LONDONER AND THIS IS MY WEEKEND HOME 
IT'S REALLY RELAXING FOR ME TO COME DOWN HERE AND GET TOTALLY ABSORBED BY WHATEVER AREA I'M DOING 
HER NEIGHBOUR MELANIE KNOWS WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO ADELE TO OPEN HER GARDEN TO THE PUBLIC 
ADELE JUST WANTS TO SHARE THE GARDEN WITH PEOPLE SHE GETS SUCH PLEASURE FROM IT AND LOVES SHOWING IT OFF 
F. R. ADELE THE DRIVE TO OPEN THE GARDEN HAS RECENTLY TAKEN ON A MORE SIGNIFICANT AND HEARTFELT MEANING 
MY MOTHER DIED JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS LAST YEAR OF CANCER I'VE NEVER EVER DONE ANYTHING FOR CHARITY 
AND I LOVE GARDENING AND JUST FELT I COULD DO SOMETHING TO HELP THAT CAUSE 
WHAT FIRST GOT YOU INTO GARDENING 
I SUPPOSE IT'S IN THE FAMILY 
MY PARENTS ALWAYS LOVED GARDENING 
IF ANYTHING'S GOING TO MAKE ME SMILE IT'S A FLOWER A PLANT A BLOSSOM ANYTHING 
BUT WHY JAPANESE 
QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT WITH MY HUSBAND TO JAPAN 
I LOVED THE TRANQUILLITY OF THEIR GARDENS AND I THOUGHT HERE 
I COULD DO SOMETHING WITH THIS 
I REALLY HOPE YOU GET IN GOOD LUCK THANK YOU I HOPE SO TOO 
THERE'S LOADS OF INTEREST IN THIS GARDEN BUT THERE'S SOME MAJOR PROBLEM AREAS TOO 
LOOK AT THIS FOR EXAMPLE IT'S BOGGY IT'S CLAY AND YOU CAN SEE IT FROM EVERYWHERE ELSE 
THERE'S ALSO A PARTERRE AREA THAT'S JUST NOT WORKING OUT AT ALL 
ARE THESE AREAS GOING TO JEOPARDISE ADELE'S CHANCES OF GETTING INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
THE PERSON ADELE WILL HAVE TO IMPRESS IS ASSISTANT COUNTY ORGANISER ROBIN LLOYD 
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE IT LOOKS NICE GENERALLY WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS HAVE LOTS OF WEEDS 
LOTS OF BARE PATCHES 
WE LOOK FOR GARDENS THAT ARE IN A GOOD STATE OF REPAIR 
SO ROBIN HAS HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND JUDGING BY HIS OWN GARDEN AN UNFINISHED PROJECT WON'T DO 
WHAT WILL HE MAKE OF ADELE'S WORK IN PROGRESS 
TODAY'S TIME FOR OUR TWO GARDENS TO FACE THE ULTIMATE TEST 
WILL THEY BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE YELLOW BOOK 
IN KENT FELICITY WARD IS ON HER WAY TO JUDGE CATHRYN'S GARDEN 
BUT WILL THE QUIRKY HIGHLIGHTS OF THE GARDEN BE ENOUGH TO DISTRACT HER FROM HOW MUCH THERE'S STILL TO DO 
MEANWHILE TENSIONS ARE RUNNING HIGH AS THE ASSISTANT COUNTY ORGANISER ARRIVES AT ADELE'S 
TO SEE IF HER JAPANESE GARDEN HAS GOT WHAT IT TAKES 
GOSH IT'S 
WHAT A GARDEN YES IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME TO WORK AT BUT I'VE ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE 
JAPANESE BASED YES ABSOLUTELY 
MY ONLY REACTION IMMEDIATELY IS THESE STONES WHICH ARE SLIPPERY AT THE MOMENT 
WHAT'LL WE DO ABOUT THAT THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM WHILE IT'S A SHAKY START IN SUSSEX 
FELICITY HAS ALSO FOUND SOMETHING NOT TO HER LIKING IN CATHRYN'S GARDEN 
AND HERE WE'VE GOT AN OLD ANDERSON SHELTER YES 
IT WAS QUITE AN UNTIDY ROCKERY SO YOUR PLANS FOR THIS BED ARE PROBABLY TO REMOVE THE YARN 
ADELE HAS LED ROBIN STRAIGHT TO HER LATEST PROJECT THIS IS MY NEWLY PLANTED AREA 
OH THE PARTERRE YES 
IT'S POTENTIALLY VERY INTERESTING BUT A LITTLE SPARSE AT THE MOMENT 
YES IF YOU WERE TO OPEN YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S PROPERLY PLANTED 
IT'S SLIGHTLY ON THE BARREN SIDE YES 
HEALTH AND SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT IN AN N. G.S GARDEN AND IS CAUSING SERIOUS CONCERN IN KENT 
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO HERE 
YES WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT EVERYTHING WE DON'T WANT IN THERE 
ALSO FOR VISITORS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE EDGES MUCH MORE CLEARLY DEFINED YES A BIT OF WORK TO DO THERE 
AND ALSO THIS YES DON'T LEAN ON THAT OR THERE WILL BE AN ALMIGHTY SPLOSH 
IF I GO IN I CAN TELL YOU YEAH 
ROBIN HAS FINALLY REACHED THE AREA THAT COULD JEOPARDISE ADELE'S CHANCES 
IT'S VERY SQUISHY ROUND HERE 
HOPEFULLY WE'LL JUST GRASS IT IN BUT NOT FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS 
IT'S A BIT OF A WORRY O. K. 
THE ASSESSMENT IS COMPLETE AND IT'S TIME FOR THE RESULTS 
I LOVED THE GARDEN PATH AS I WALKED TO YOUR FRONT DOOR ENCHANTING 
AND A VERY INVITING FRONT DOOR 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LETTING ME LOOK ROUND MY PLEASURE 
HOWEVER THERE ARE A FEW CONCERNS 
WE'VE GOT THE SLIPPERY STONES 
THE PARTERRE AROUND THE CORNER THE PARTERRE NEEDS IMPROVEMENT 
I LOVE THIS PART OF THE GARDEN 
THE TULIPS FULL OF EXPECTANCY 
THERE ARE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF IT THAT HAVE GOT TO BE TIDIED UP 
AT THE ANDERSON SHELTER IT NEEDS TO BE REPLANTED 
AND THE BRIDGE THE PONDS YEAH 
MY MAIN RESERVATION AND WORRY IS THE SOIL DOWN AT THE BOTTOM 
IT REALLY HAS TO BE IMPROVED 
SO WILL FELICITY SEE THE POTENTIAL OF CATHRYN'S GARDEN DESPITE THE POND AND DANGEROUS HANDRAIL 
HAVING HAD THIS GARDEN UP TO NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WE'D LOVE TO HAVE IT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE 
BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S NOT READY 
SO IT'S A NO FOR CATHRYN SHE MUST BE DEVASTATED 
A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT WE HAVEN'T MADE IT THIS YEAR BUT WE KNOW WE'VE A LOT OF WORK 
SO WE NOW HAVE TO MAKE A PLAN AND DECIDE WHAT TO TACKLE AND GET ON WITH IT REALLY 
BUT ALL IS NOT LOST AS SHE HAS ANOTHER CHANCE WHEN THE COUNTY ORGANISER RETURNS LATER IN THE YEAR 
LET'S HOPE IT'S BETTER NEWS FOR ADELE BACK IN SUSSEX 
YOU'VE CERTAINLY GOT FORTY FIVE MINUTES' WORTH OF INTEREST IN THE GARDEN WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
WE'VE STILL GOT THAT PROBLEM OF THE SOIL THAT NEEDS TO BE CORDONED OFF 
THAT HAVING BEEN SAID I THINK WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU OH GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
SO SHE'S MADE IT BUT ONLY JUST AND THIS GARDEN WILL BE OPENING FOR THE PUBLIC IN JUST THREE MONTHS' TIME 
I'M REALLY REALLY THRILLED YES VERY GOOD 
THREE WEEKS LATER AND I'M BACK AT CATHRYN'S GARDEN IN KENT AND DETERMINED TO HELP HER GET IN 
THIS IS THE OLD AIR RAID SHELTER LOOKS LIKE A BOMB'S HIT IT RECENTLY DOESN'T IT YES 
WHAT'S THE PLAN WELL A COUPLE OF IDEAS WE THOUGHT WE COULD PUT MORE ROSES IN BUT WE HAVE LOTS ALREADY 
THE NEXT PLAN WAS HERBS AND GRASSES SOMETHING THAT SMELLS NICE LOOKS NICE SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
FROM WHAT ELSE IS HERE I THINK HERBS WOULD LOVE IT HERE IT'S REALLY SUNNY AND OPEN 
AND YOU'VE GOT THIS BRICK EDGING YES WE'LL RE LAY THAT AND TURN IT INTO A PERFECT CIRCLE 
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL GET PERFECT NO IT'S EASY 
JUST PUT A STICK IN THE MIDDLE A BIT OF STRING AND GO ROUND IT PERFECT CIRCLE WE CAN DO THAT 
I HOPE YOU DO COME ON THEN LET'S DO SOMETHING GLOVES ON LET'S GET RID OF THIS METAL 
YOU CAN PROBABLY SELL THIS AS A WORK OF ART THAT WOULD BE USEFUL 
RIGHT SHALL WE START DIGGING I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND O. K. 
IT'S GOING TO LOOK REALLY GOOD YEAH WE SHOULD GET IT DONE 
WHILST I LEAVE CATHRYN TO CARRY ON TRANSFORMING ONE EYESORE IN THE GARDEN I LOOK AT THE OTHER 
A NATURAL POND NOT ONLY LOOKS GREAT BUT IT ALSO BRINGS IN A LOAD OF WILDLIFE TO THE GARDEN 
BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP ON TOP OF THEM 
THEY'RE A HIGH MAINTENANCE PART OF THE GARDEN YOU'RE LOOKING TO COVER ABOUT SIXTY PER CENT OF THE WATER SURFACE 
KEEP THE SUNLIGHT OFF IT IT TURNS THE WATER GREEN 
WHEN YOU CUT BACK ANY FOLIAGE TAKE IT OUT OF THE WATER DON'T LET IT ROT IN THERE 
AGAIN THAT IMPROVES THE CLARITY 
JUST SOUTH IN SUSSEX ADELE HAS A LOT TO DO TO BE READY FOR HER OPEN DAY IN JUST EIGHT WEEKS' TIME 
CONGRATULATIONS YOU MADE IT YES I'M ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED 
EVEN WITH THIS DODGY AREA 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT BUT MAYBE YOU CAN HELP OUT AND TELL ME WITH SOME IDEAS 
THE SOIL IS REALLY CLAY IT'S SUBSOIL IN EFFECT 
YOU HAVE TO REALLY IMPROVE THE SOIL PUT LOADS OF ORGANIC MATTER IN 
WHAT ABOUT FOR YOUR OPEN DAY BASICALLY WE'LL JUST BARRIER IT OFF AND HOPE NOBODY NOTICES IT 
AND NOBODY WILL SINK I THINK THEY WILL NOTICE 
ONE THING IS HOW IT TIES IN WITH THE NATURAL LANDSCAPE HERE 
SHALL WE GO UP TO THE HOUSE AND SEE HOW IT LOOKS THAT'S QUITE A VANTAGE POINT LOVELY 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT IT LOOKS GOOD FROM THE HOUSE THE REST OF THE GARDEN DOES 
WHAT I'D DO IS CONTINUE THE RHODODENDRONS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BACK 
AND HORSESHOE THEM ROUND 
THEN TAKE THE LAWN DOWN AND BLEND IT IN NICELY 
YOU NEED TO THINK QUITE LARGE SCALE AS FAR AS PLANTING IS CONCERNED 
MAYBE SOME TREES I HAVE GOT SOME SILVER BIRCHES THAT I THOUGHT OF PUTTING DOWN FANTASTIC 
WOULD THAT BE O. K. LOVELY 
IN WINTER THEY'LL BE STRIKING BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST PLONK THEM DOWN 
THEY NEED TO BLEND IN AND PUT SOME OTHER EVERGREEN TREES IN FRONT OF THEM TO DRAW YOU ROUND 
YEAH GOOD SO YOU'LL DIG FOR ME A FEW HOLES NO I'M NOT DIGGING I'M HERE AS A DESIGNER ONLY 
THE BILL'S ALREADY IN THE POST I CAN DEAL WITH THAT GREAT 
ADELE HAS ANOTHER PROBLEM AREA BUT I MIGHT KNOW HOW TO HELP 
THIS PLANTED AREA DOESN'T QUITE WORK BECAUSE HALF IS IN SHADE AND HALF OF IT'S IN SUN 
BUT IT'S GOT LAVENDER THROUGHOUT 
IT HATES THE SHADE LIKES THE SUN 
LOOK FOR STABLE CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT IN SUN OR SHADE 
OR LOOK FOR PLANTS THAT CAN TOLERATE SUN AND SHADE AT THE SAME TIME 
BOTH OF TODAY'S GARDENS HAVE BIG DEADLINES LOOMING AND THEY'RE HARD AT WORK 
CATHRYN'S TRANSFORMING THE OLD AIR RAID SHELTER BUT DELIVERY OF SLATE IS PROVING TO BE DESTRUCTIVE 
I'LL GO THE OTHER SIDE IF I YELL STOP 
O. K. 
COME THIS WAY A LITTLE BIT 
O. K. PERFECT 
THE LORRY THEY BROUGHT THE SLATE ON WAS TOO LARGE FOR THE LANE 
SO AFTER SOME REVERSING WE'VE NOW GOT IT DELIVERED HERE 
MINUS A PIECE OF HAWTHORN HEDGE AND QUITE A LOT FURTHER TO TAKE IT TO WHERE WE NEED IT NEVER MIND 
I AM WORRIED THAT WITH ONLY DAYS TO GO CATHRYN HAS FAR TOO MUCH LEFT TO DO 
AND COULD FACE A SECOND REJECTION 
I HOPE WE'VE DONE ENOUGH 
WE HAVE DONE A GREAT DEAL OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS 
WE'VE STILL GOT BITS AND PIECES TO DO BUT HOPEFULLY IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH 
BACK IN SUSSEX ADELE GOT THE GO AHEAD TO OPEN HER GARDEN 
IF SHE RECTIFIED THE PROBLEM PARTERRE HOW'S SHE GETTING ON 
AT THE MOMENT THIS IS A PROBLEM AREA 
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO THIS AREA YET 
I'M TAKING OUT ALL THE DEAD LAVENDERS AND TRYING TO MAKE THE EARTH MORE AERATED 
OTHERWISE MAYBE I'LL NEED TO DO A BIT MORE THAN THAT 
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL ALL BE SORTED ON THE DAY IT WILL BE 
AND IT'LL LOOK O. K. 
AGAINST MY ADVICE ADELE IS NOT TOUCHING THE LARGE EXPANSE OF BARE SOIL AND WILL CORDON IT OFF 
AS THE COUNTY ORGANISER SUGGESTED 
I JUST HOPE IT DOESN'T DISTRACT VISITORS FROM THE GARDEN 
IN KENT CATHRYN'S BEEN HARD AT WORK AND THE DAY OF THE REASSESSMENT IS HERE 
SHE'LL BE PRETTY IMPRESSED IT'S SO DIFFERENT FROM HOW IT WAS IT WAS A COMPLETE MESS 
IT LOOKS A LOT BETTER GREAT YEAH THANK YOU 
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK 
CATHRYN'S CERTAINLY PUT IN THE HOURS SHE'S DONE SO MUCH WORK SO MUCH GRAFT 
I THINK IT LOOKS FANTASTIC 
THIS WAS FALLING OVER SHE'S REBUILT IT FROM SCRATCH NICE AND SOLID 
BUT THE COUNTY ORGANISER WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE 
WILL SHE THINK THIS GARDEN IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE YELLOW BOOK 
CATHRYN'S PUT HER HEART AND SOUL INTO THIS PLACE BUT NOW HER FATE LIES WITH THE COUNTY ORGANISER 
HER FATHER IN LAW DAVID AND I WILL TAKE A BACK SEAT WHILE IT'S REASSESSED 
IT'S DOWN TO THE WIRE WORKING TO THE LAST ABSOLUTELY 
FELICITY'S HERE NOW HERE WE GO READY FOR MY VISIT GOOD TO SEE YOU 
LET'S LOSE THE BROOM AND WALK ROUND FOLLOW ME 
GOODNESS THIS IS A CHANGE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK INTERESTING YOU'VE GONE FOR SLATE YES 
AND YOU'VE PLANTED HERBS AND SOME GRASSES ARE YOU PLANTING ANY MORE 
WE HAVE GOT MORE TO GO IN BUT WE'RE GOING TO WAIT AND SEE HOW BIG THESE GROW 
AND WE HAVE SOME IDEAS FOR A SCULPTURE IN THE MIDDLE 
WE'RE STILL TOYING WITH WHAT 
HOW DID THAT BIT GO THEN 
I THINK IT WENT QUITE WELL 
GOOD SIGN MM HMM O. K. 
COME AND SEE THE PONDS LOVELY 
GOODNESS A NEW BRIDGE STOP PEOPLE FALLING IN 
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THE GROUND HAVE YOU BANKED IT UP WITH BRICKS 
NOT REALLY WE HAD TO DIG A LOT OF PLANTS OUT IT'S MOSTLY GRASSES WE GOT RID OF 
NOW WE JUST NEED TO GIVE IT A COAT OF WOOD STAIN 
AND WE'LL USE SOME OLD ROCKS TO BANK UP THE SOIL THAT'S LEFT THERE 
SO WE DON'T LOSE ANY MORE OF IT INTO THE POND WELL DONE 
THAT'S GOOD STEADY YEAH WELL DONE 
THE REASSESSMENT IS COMPLETE BUT HAS SHE DONE ENOUGH WELL DONE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'VE REALLY ENJOYED SEEING IT AGAIN 
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF PLANTING TO DO 
WHICH DOES WORRY ME SLIGHTLY 
A LOT OF AREAS NEED A LOT OF ATTENTION 
YOU'VE GOT TO WORK REALLY HARD FOR A LONG TIME 
CERTAINLY ALL THIS AUTUMN YOU'VE GOT TO PLANT A LOT 
BUT IF YOU CAN DO IT AND YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD TO GET THIS FAR 
I THINK WE COULD TAKE YOU ON BOARD 
FANTASTIC WE'LL GET STUCK IN AND CRACK ON WITH IT GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
CATHRYN YOU MADE IT HOW DO YOU FEEL QUITE NERVOUS NOW VERY NERVOUS ACTUALLY 
YEAH BUT IT'LL BE FUN IT'S A RICHLY DESERVED SUCCESS 
SHE'LL BE OPENING HER GARDEN GATES TO THE PUBLIC NEXT YEAR 
IT'S MID MAY AT CAXTON MANOR THE MORNING OF THE OPENING 
ADELE AND HER FAMILY ARE PREPARING SO THE DAY RUNS SMOOTHLY 
IN MEMORY OF HER MOTHER I KNOW IT'S A LAST MINUTE JOB BUT WE WERE WORKING TO MIDNIGHT 
DOING ALL SORTS OF THINGS THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST THINGS ON OUR LIST SO IT'S O. K. 
WE CAN MANAGE THIS THERE'S OTHER BITS AND PIECES 
BUT EVERYBODY HAS LAST MINUTE THINGS TO DO 
THE GATES ARE JUST ABOUT TO OPEN AND ADELE'S PUT IN LOADS OF WORK 
THE GARDEN LOOKS FANTASTIC I JUST HOPE THERE'S LOADS OF PEOPLE 
THEY'RE IN FOR A REAL TREAT 
JUST THREE MONTHS AGO THIS JAPANESE INSPIRED GARDEN FACED SOME REAL PROBLEMS 
THE PARTERRE WAS SCRUFFY BUT NOW LOOKS SMART AND FORMAL 
THE SUN'S SHINING AND THE GARDEN IS LOOKING TRULY BEAUTIFUL 
THE PUBLIC ARE POURING IN AND THE RECEPTION IS WELCOME 
THE UNIQUE SETTING OF THE GARDEN IS PROVING TO BE A REAL HIT WITH THE VISITORS 
THE LAKE IS BEAUTIFUL AND THIS SETTING HERE IS FANTASTIC 
IT'S JUST BEAUTIFULLY LAID OUT EVERYTHING'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT 
IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE TO SEE SUCH LOVELY PLANTING AND THOUGHTFUL PLANTING AS WELL 
HOW'S THE DAY GOING 
FANTASTIC WE'VE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE IT'S BEEN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
THE WEATHER STAYED FANTASTIC AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE 
SO THE PAYING PUBLIC ARE THRILLED AND ADELE IS PLEASED BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ASSISTANT COUNTY ORGANISER 
ROBIN WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GREAT SHE'S RESOLVED ALL THE ISSUES IN THE MAIN 
IT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF MATURING 
CERTAIN THINGS LIKE THE BRIDGE WILL AGE NICELY 
BUT OTHER THAN THAT SHE'S DONE WELL 
ADELE'S HUSBAND JULES IS THRILLED THE DAY HAS GONE SO WELL FOR HER 
THE EFFORT SHE'S PUT INTO IT IS THERE FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE 
I THINK IT'S BEEN A GREAT PLUS IN HER LIFE 
HER MOTHER DIED LAST YEAR FROM CANCER SO THAT'S A CHARITY THAT'S CLOSE TO HER HEART 
THIS WILL BE A CONTRIBUTION TO THAT SO THAT'S ONE ASPECT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ADELE 
DID ANY VISITORS MENTION THE PROBLEM AREAS DID THEY SEE THE RED AND WHITE TAPE 
IT'S AMAZING I HAVE TO TELL YOU NOBODY MENTIONED A WORD ABOUT THE PROBLEM AREA OR THE RED TAPE 
REALLY YES YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO HEAR THAT 
YOUR FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF INTEREST IS KEEPING THEM OCCUPIED EXACTLY 
SO ROLL ON NEXT YEAR WHEN WE HAVE A DIFFERENT ASPECT POSITIVE THINKING 
ADELE'S FIRST OPEN DAY HAS BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS 
SHE'S HAD THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE THROUGH THE GATE AND RAISED ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FOR CHARITY 
SHE CAN NOW PROUDLY DECLARE HERSELF AS PART OF THE PRESTIGIOUS N. G.S
