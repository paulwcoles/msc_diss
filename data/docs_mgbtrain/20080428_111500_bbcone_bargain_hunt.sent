I LIKE YOUR YOUTHFUL ENTHUSIASM BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHICH TEAM IS GOING TO WIN

WE'LL FIND OUT IN A MINUTE AS THE PROGRAMME PROGRESSES 
BUT RIGHT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET THREE HUNDRED 
AT YOUR RATE YOU COULD GET THREE HUNDRED THREE PIECE SUITES FOR YOUR THREE HUNDRED 
BUT PLEASE DON'T GO BUYING ANY THREE PIECE SUITES 
YOU KNOW THE RULES YOUR EXPERTS AWAIT OFF YOU GO AND VERY GOOD LUCK ISN'T THAT BRILLIANT 
TWO ROMANTICO COUPLES 
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A ROMANTIC OUTCOME 
INVESTIGATING FOR THE REDS IS CHARLES HANSON 
AND ORIENTEERING FOR THE BLUES IS PAUL LAIDLAW 
A NICE PLATE LOUISE IT'S STAFFORDSHIRE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY 
A BIT ORIENTAL YES IT DOES ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
SORRY TO DISRUPT YOU THAT'S O. K. 
I'VE JUST COME ACROSS THIS I'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S A SOLID SILVER SANDWICH BOX WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY LET'S HAVE A LOOK IT SPARKLES FIRST OF ALL 
IT DOES IT'S LOVELY YOU'RE A SPARKLY SORT OF 
IT'S VERY HEAVY IT IS AND THAT'S A GOOD SIGN FIRST OF ALL WEIGHT 
GAUGE OF SILVER IS VERY IMPORTANT 
YOU SAID A SANDWICH BOX HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WELL I MEAN 
I THINK IT'S MULTIFUNCTIONAL 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO STICK A BOG STANDARD CHEESE AND PICKLE SANDWICH IN THERE 
YOU COULD USE IT FOR SOMETHING MAYBE FOR CIGARS OR SOMETHING 
ANY SORT OF BOX OF THIS TYPE COULD BE A CIGAR BOX OR FOR A VARIETY OF USES 
BUT ON HERE CHRIS LOUISE IMPORTANTLY IT'S GOT THE HALLMARKS ON 
WHICH IS A GOOD SIGN 
THERE'S A CROWN FOR SHEFFIELD 
AND THE YOUNG QUEEN VICTORIA SOVEREIGN'S HEAD 
SO WE KNOW IT'S PRE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FIVE OR THEREABOUTS 
AND THE DATE LETTER P. AND WE CAN DATE IT SO PRECISELY IS FOR ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE IT'S VERY NICE 
WHAT'S IT WORTH 
IT'S ONE HUNDRED NINETY THEY'RE WANTING FOR IT 
UM OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A LOT 
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD FETCH AT A SALE 
IF IT CAME TO A VALUATION DAY I WOULD SAY TO A CLIENT 
HOPEFULLY UP IN YORKSHIRE 
THE ESTIMATE WOULD BE PERHAPS ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
ON A GOOD DAY WITH THE WIND BLOWING UP IN LEYBURN 
IT MIGHT MAKE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
IT'S A VERY COMMERCIAL VERY NOVEL PIECE OF SILVER 
SHALL I TRY AND WANGLE THE PRICE DOWN THEN 
WANGLE WHAT'S WANGLE BARTER 
BARTER IS THAT A NORTHERN TERM 
I USE IT GO ON THEN GET OFF THEN 
CHRIS AND LOUISE SNAPPED UP THE SANDWICH BOX FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE TASTY 
I QUITE LIKE THE LITTLE MUSTARD DISHES THEY'RE NICE WITH THE BLUE INSIDE YEAH 
HEY GUYS I SAW YOU LOOKING AT SILVER EARLIER ON 
I WONDER IF YOU LIKE THAT 
THAT'S NICE YEAH VERY DAINTY 
SIMPLE ISN'T IT TELL ME WHAT IT IS 
A VERY SMALL CANDLE HOLDER 
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT 
IT'S A TAPER STICK 
WHICH BEGGARS THE QUESTION 
WHAT ON EARTH IS A TAPER WHEN IT'S AT HOME 
A TAPER IS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES A DINKY CANDLE 
RIGHT AND YOU USE A TAPER TO CARRY LIGHT FROM ROOM TO ROOM 
SO I'M SAT IN MY GEORGIAN DRAWING ROOM 
I'VE DONE SOME QUAFFING 
AND I FEEL A LITTLE BIT TIRED I'M OFF TO BED DARLING 
AND I TAKE SOME LIGHT FROM THE TABLE CANDLESTICK 
AND I RETREAT UP THE STAIRS 
AND I USE THIS TO LIGHT THE CANDLES IN MY BEDROOM 
THAT'S A TAPER STICK FOR YOU 
NOW THE NEXT QUESTION HOW OLD IS IT I HAVE NO IDEA 
THEY WEREN'T USING THEM IN THE FIFTIES I'LL GIVE YOU THAT MUCH 
UM NINETEEN TWENTIES O. K. A BIT OLDER THAN THAT 
IN AESTHETIC AND STYLE IT'S EARLY GEORGIAN 
THE FIRST HALF OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
BUT STRICTLY SPEAKING 
THIS IS A REPRODUCTION OF THE LATE VICTORIAN ERA NINETEEN HUNDRED O. K. 
NOW LET'S LOOK IN DETAIL AT WHAT WE HAVE HERE 
WE HAVE A LITTLE WAISTED SOCKET FOR OUR TAPER 
THEN THIS KNOCKED BALUSTER STEM 
ON THIS ELEGANT LITTLE HEXAGONAL PAN 
AND TO CARRY IT UPSTAIRS 
WE HAVE THIS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS LITTLE SEA SCROLL HANDLE 
NOW YOU TAKE A HOLD OF THAT AND GIVE ME YOUR REACTION 
IT IS VERY HEAVY FOR ITS SIZE ISN'T IT ISN'T IT 
SO IT'S SILVER THEN GOOD QUESTION IT IS 
AND THESE LITTLE HALLMARKS HERE ASSURE US OF THAT 
TELLING US IT WAS ASSAYED IN LONDON IN NINETEEN HUNDRED RIGHT 
HOW MUCH IS IT RIGHT AT THE MOMENT I'VE GOT THE PRICE DOWN TO EIGHTY 
I THINK WE NEED MORE THAN THAT OFF IT 
I WILL BE PERFECTLY HONEST WITH YOU AS AN AUCTIONEER 
IF IT COMES INTO MY SALE ROOM I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT AT FIFTY TO EIGHTY 
RIGHT BUT LET'S SAY I COULD GET IT FOR SIXTY 
THAT WOULD BE IDEAL THAT'D BE GOOD YOU THINK THAT'S A GOER 
I THINK THERE'S A BET IN THAT SO AM I UNDER ORDERS 
YES IT'S REALLY NICE GO FOR IT 
AT JUST SIXTY WILL THE BLUES' TAPER STICK GLOW 
ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT BEING ON BARGAIN HUNT 
IS HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY OF POKING ABOUT IN ALL THIS STUFF 
LOOK AT THIS SHOP ABSOLUTELY CRAMMED WITH GEAR 
JUST OCCASIONALLY YOU CAN COME ACROSS SOMETHING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY DREAMY LIKE THIS JOKER HERE 
YOUR FIRST CHALLENGE IS TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS 
IT LOOKS A BIT LIKE A CHILD'S SCOOTER WITH HANDLEBARS 
EXCEPT IT'S MISSING THE WHEELS 
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS THING WAS MADE A LONG TIME 
BEFORE YOUR AVERAGE CHILD'S SCOOTER 
I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY MADE AROUND EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY 
IT IS MADE OF THE MOST DELICIOUS MAHOGANY 
THIS DARKISH RED MAHOGANY IS CALLED HONDURAS MAHOGANY 
IT WAS IMPORTED INTO THIS COUNTRY IN QUITE LARGE QUANTITIES 
BY FINE CABINET MAKERS INCLUDING MESSRS. GILLOWS 
YOU THINK ABOUT A FIRM LIKE GILLOWS AS ONLY MAKING BITS OF FURNITURE WELL THEY DIDN'T 
THEY MADE ENTIRE HOUSE CONTENTS ALL THE REQUISITES FOR A RICH COUNTRY LANDOWNER 
AND THE PERSON WHO OWNED THIS OBJECT CERTAINLY WAS A LANDOWNER 
HE WAS A MAN OF PROPERTY 
HE WAS IN BUSINESS AND TO GET AROUND HIS BUSINESS EMPIRE 
HE HAD TO RIDE A HORSE 
THE HORSE WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF HIS MOTOR CAR 
BUT ONCE HE HAD GOT HOME HE WOULD WANT TO RELAX 
AND ONE OF THE BORING THINGS ABOUT BEING A HORSEMAN IS WEARING THOSE LONG LEATHER BOOTS 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET HOME AND YOU'RE TIRED AT THE END OF A LONG DAY YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THE BOOTS OFF 
THIS THING WAS MADE SPECIFICALLY AS A BOOT JACK AN AID TO YOUR REMOVAL 
OF THOSE VERY DIRTY BORING TIGHT LEATHER RIDING BOOTS 
AND IT'S GOT ONE OR TWO INTERESTING FEATURES 
THE HANDLEBARS SO TO SPEAK WOULD TAKE YOUR WEIGHT 
YOU WOULD INSERT YOUR BOOTED FOOT LIKE THAT 
PUSHING UP THAT FRONT BAR WHICH IS SHAPED 
TO CURVE OVER THE TOP OF YOUR FOOT 
I GIVE A BIT OF A HEAVE HO LOOK AT THAT 
THE HEEL SLIPS OUT OF THE SHOE IN THIS CASE 
BUT THE BOOT IF YOU WERE WEARING A HUNTING BOOT 
I ONCE FOLLOWED ONE OF THESE IN A SALE 
I THOUGHT WHAT A NICE OBJECT THAT IS FOR TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED 
DID YOU KNOW WHAT IT MADE IN THE AUCTION 
IT MADE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SO I KNOW THIS SORT OF OBJECT CAN MAKE MONEY 
THIS ONE IS AVAILABLE IN BARNARD CASTLE TODAY FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY 
I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT THE DEALER WOULD NEGOTIATE DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
AND AT THAT I HAVE TO SAY 
IT'S PRETTY CHEESY 
HI THERE 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT A HAND PAINTED MILITARY STYLE WALLET WITH SOMEBODY'S INITIALS 
AND CHRIS WHAT HAVE YOU GOT I'VE GOT A PAIR OF BINOCULARS 
I WASN'T SURE HOW OLD THEY WERE 
BUT THEY LOOK WELL USED AND THEY CERTAINLY LOOK QUITE OLD 
AGAIN LOOKING AT THEIR TYPE AND THEIR COLOUR THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE ABOUT NINETEEN FIFTEEN AS WELL 
SO OF THAT FIRST WORLD WAR PERIOD 
THIS IS VERY NICE IT'S EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY IMPORTANTLY THERE'S ALSO THIS MILITARIA INTEREST 
WE'VE GOT THIS ARTILLERY SOLDIER FIRST WORLD WAR 
INSCRIBED CALAIS NINETEEN EIGHTEEN AND IT'S IN A VERY NICE ART NOUVEAU FRAME 
WHAT WE HAVE ALMOST GOT HERE IS A LIQUORICE ALLSORT 
A WONDERFUL LOT OF OBJECTS OF FIRST WORLD WAR INTEREST AND FINALLY 
I'VE GOT THESE AS WELL 
AGAIN TO ROUND IT OFF I'VE FOUND THIS REALLY NICE PAIR OF MEDALS 
IT'S THE GREAT WAR MEDAL AND THE VICTORY MEDAL AWARDED TO A PRIVATE 
THEY ARE OF SUCH GREAT INTEREST TO COLLECTORS 
I THINK THEY'RE INDIVIDUALLY PRICED 
MINE IS THIRTY FIVE THERE'S PRICES HERE AS WELL 
I'LL ALMOST SAY THE MARKET TODAY THE ROMANCE OF THESE ITEMS 
IT'S ALMOST AN IDEA TO PUT THEM TOGETHER IN A PARCEL LOT 
I COULD SEE A COLLECTOR WISHING TO PAY PERHAPS BETWEEN EIGHTY AND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
O. K. LOUISE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THERE'S NO MONEY IN THE WALLET I DID HAVE A GOOD LOOK 
AND I'LL SEE IF THESE ARE GOING TO WORK ANYWAY 
THEY'RE IN GOOD WORKING ORDER BUT WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE 
SHALL WE FIND OUR MAN TO PAY FOR THEM YEAH DEFINITELY 
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN BARTER DOWN THE PRICE 
THE REDS' VERY INTERESTING LOT OF MILITARIA WAS BOUGHT FOR ONLY NINETY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THEM THEN 
THEY'RE SO COOL 
JUST OUR KIND OF THING IT'D BE GOOD FOR MOUNTAIN RESCUE 
LOOK GUYS I'M GUESSING YOU DIDN'T BRING THEM WITH YOU 
AND I HOPE YOU'RE NOT BEING SERIOUS 
THEY'RE REALLY COOL THEY'RE FANTASTIC 
I GUESS WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BUY THEM YEAH 
BUT WAIT A MINUTE MAYBE THERE'S MORE TO THESE THAN WE THOUGHT 
LOOK AT THIS FOR A PROVENANCE 
SIR ANDREW COMMON HUNTER HOUSE SHOTLEY BRIDGE COUNTY DURHAM 
SHERIFF OF DURHAM 
AND OUR MAN HIGH SHERIFF 
BOUGHT SECOND HAND 
BECAUSE HE BOUGHT EX ARMY GOVERNMENT SURPLUS SNOW SHOES 
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOVERNMENT SURPLUS 
WELL SEE THE MARKS ON THE WEBBING STRAPS HERE YEAH 
THERE'S A GOVERNMENT BROAD ARROW THERE 
AND THAT'S AN ORDNANCE INSPECTOR'S MARK 
AND I'M SUFFICIENTLY SAD TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU 
THAT BHG LIMITED ARE BARROW HEPBURN AND GALE 
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS TO THE WAR OFFICE FROM THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
AND THESE ARE ACTUALLY FABULOUSLY RARE OH 
BUT NO ONE CARES BUT NO THEY DO 
IT IS A HELL OF A NICHE MARKET 
THE CHANCE OF US FINDING THE FEW COLLECTORS 
WHO ARE INTERESTED IN SUCH AT THE AUCTION ROOM 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S A REAL LONG SHOT 
BUT MY WORD THEY'RE QUIRKY WHAT DO YOU THINK AT SEVENTY FIVE 
WE NEED TO DO SOME WORK 
WE NEED TO TRY HARD TO GET THAT PRICE DOWN TO UP THE ODDS A WEE BIT 
O. K. SHALL WE GO FOR THEM YEAH I THINK SO 
SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO 
SNOWSHOES WELL I NEVER 
AT FIFTY THEY ARE HOPING FOR STORMY WEATHER WITH THOSE MUSH MUSH 
AFTER OUR TEAMS HAVE FOUND THEIR THREE ITEMS 
THE EXPERTS WILL BE GIVEN ANY LEFTOVER LOLLY TO FIND A BONUS BUY 
THAT SPECIAL PIECE THAT MAY BOOST THEIR TEAM'S PROFITS AT THE AUCTION 
THE BIG QUESTION IS WILL THE EXPERTS' INTUITION PROVE TO BE CORRECT 
I'VE MADE A DECISION WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS OH RIGHT 
IT REMINDS IT REMINDS ME OF OUR DAUGHTER ISOBEL 
I THINK IT'S A BABY PLATE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YES IT IS IT'S VERY NICE 
WE'VE GOT A WONDERFUL PRINTED SCENE HERE 
FAIRY FOLK WITH TINY WINGS FLYING ALL OVER MY PLATES AND THINGS 
ISN'T THAT SWEET IT IS YEAH IT'S LOVELY 
ON THE BASE WE CAN SEE MABEL LUCIE ATTWELL 
MABEL WAS A REALLY GREAT GREAT ILLUSTRATOR 
SHE WAS MADE FAMOUS BY THE PETER PAN BOOK OF NINETEEN THIRTY WHICH SHE ILLUSTRATED 
IF WE TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN WHO'S MADE IT I HAVEN'T LOOKED 
THERE WE GO SHELLEY I'VE HEARD OF THAT SHELLEY A GREAT GREAT NAME 
WHAT IS IT WORTH LOUISE WELL 
IT'S THIRTY FIVE THE TICKET PRICE ON IT 
I THINK AT AUCTION LOUISE IT'S SOMETHING WORTH 
ON A BAD DAY TWENTY ON A REALLY GOOD DAY THIRTY FIVE 
RIGHT SO I THINK BE DECISIVE 
I THINK IT'S WORTH A SHOT I'LL GO AND BARTER THEM DOWN AND SEE HOW MUCH I CAN GET OFF IT 
AT THIRTY LOUISE WAS BOWLED OVER BY THE BABY PLATE AH 
LOOK WHAT WE BOUGHT WHILE YOU WERE LOUNGING AROUND 
MIND READERS 
OH YES SHIRAZ MY FAVOURITE 
BUT THIS YOU'VE BOUGHT THE CARRIER 
YES MY WORD WELL DONE YOU 
WHY 
IT'S NICE IT'S PRETTY IT'S SIMPLE IT'S USEFUL 
WE FIGURED IT WOULD APPEAL TO MOST PEOPLE BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE DRINK WINE SO 
I AGREE WITH ALL OF THE ABOVE 
SOLD YEAH ALTHOUGH WHAT CAN I ADD TO THIS 
INDEED ISN'T IT ELEGANT 
AND WOULDN'T THIS SIT IN TODAY'S HOME WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE AT ALL 
AND DOESN'T IT ELEVATE YOUR BOTTLE OF SUPERMARKET PLONK SOMEWHAT YEAH 
SO LET'S LOOK AT THIS IT'S SILVER PLATE HERE 
I'LL SIT THAT DOWN THERE AND HAVE THAT LATER 
SCISSOR ACTION HERE

IT'S NOT DONE TOO MUCH WORK 
SO THERE WE GO WE OPEN IT UP THERE'S OUR BOTTLE 
OVER SHE GOES CLOSE THAT DOWN THERE 
I LIKE THAT VERY MUCH 
NO TROUBLE WITH THAT BUT WHAT WAS THE DAMAGE 
WE MANAGED TO GET IT DOWN TO FORTY FIVE 
IF I WERE PLACING AN AUCTION ESTIMATE ON THAT AND I'LL BE MEAN 
I'D SAY THIRTY TO FIFTY 
RIGHT SO I THINK YOU'RE THERE OR THEREABOUTS 
NOT IN THE BAG BUT IT COULD EASILY BE EXCELLENT WELL DONE 
POP OFF COME BACK WITH THREE GLASSES AND WE'LL SEE YOU THEN 
TIME'S UP LET'S RECAP ON WHAT THE REDS HAVE BOUGHT 
CHRIS AND LOUISE'S SILVER SANDWICH BOX IS PRETTY 
BUT AT ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE IS IT TOO BIG FOR YOUR LUNCHBOX

QUITE IT'S QUITE A LOT OF MONEY ISN'T IT IT'S A GOOD BUDGET I LIKE IT 
ARE YOU GOING OUT SHOPPING BIG TIME THEN OR ARE YOU DOING YOUR CAUTIOUS AND SOFT UNDERBELLY APPROACH 
LET'S GO WITH THE CANNY SCOTS' APPROACH SHALL WE 
AS PER USUAL AND MAKE A WHACKING GREAT PROFIT ON IT WE HOPE 
WELL DONE PAUL WHILE HE'S DOING THAT I'LL SHOVE OFF AND LOOK AT A BIT OF HISTORY 
MUSEUMS COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES 
AND YOU'D THINK SOMEWHERE AS BIG AS BEAMISH MUSEUM NEAR NEWCASTLE 
WOULD HAVE ALL THE SPACE IN THE WORLD IT NEEDS 
TO SHOW OFF ALL ITS EXHIBITS 
BUT EVEN HERE WITH THEIR THREE HUNDRED ACRES 
AND THEIR VERY OWN ONE HUNDRED YEAR OLD FULLY RESTORED TOWN 
THEY HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH SPACE TO DISPLAY ALL THEIR ITEMS 
IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES REALLY 
BUT AN INCREASING PROBLEM AS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE DONATE THINGS TO THE MUSEUM'S COLLECTIONS 
AND IT IS NOT JUST POTS AND PANS 
BEAMISH HAS BEEN GIVEN THINGS AS LARGE AS TRACTORS HORSE DRAWN VEHICLES RAILWAY ROLLING STOCK 
AND EVEN WHOLE STEAM ENGINES 
IT HOLDS THESE IN A MASSIVE PURPOSE BUILT AIR CONDITIONED STORE 
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THOUGH IS TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL THEIR SMALLER OBJECTS 
HERE IN THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE GOT TOGETHER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM 
IN RATHER AN UNUSUAL WAY HERE AT WHAT THEY CALL THEIR REGIONAL RESOURCE CENTRE 
IMAGINE YOU'VE GOT A FAMILY PIECE OR SOMETHING THAT YOU BOUGHT AT AUCTION AND YOU WANT TO RESEARCH IT 
YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WHETHER IT'S IN THE COLLECTIONS HERE 
WELL WHERE BETTER PLACE TO START THAN THE OLD COMPUTER 
NOW WHAT I HAVE IN MIND IS A CERAMIC ITEM 
SO I TYPE IN C. E. R. A M. I. C. 
THEN GIVE IT A BIT OF A SEARCH 
AND WHAT IS GOING TO COME UP A WHOLE RAFT OF POTENTIAL HERE 
THERE WE GO THAT'S THE FELLOW I'M AFTER 
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT DOES LOOK ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS DOESN'T IT 
WELL HIDEOUS OR BEAUTIFUL IT'S ALL IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER 
TARA 
I'M GOING TO TRY TO FIND THE ACTUAL TRAY AMONGST THE FORTY THOUSAND ITEMS THEY'VE MANAGED TO PRESERVE HERE 
THEY SOLVED THE STORAGE PROBLEM BY TAKING A LARGE BUILDING WITH A FLOOR AREA OF ABOUT A TENNIS COURT 
INSTALLING AIR CONDITIONING AND CLIMATE CONTROL 
AND THEN THIS AMAZING FACILITY OF STORAGE SHELVES 
THESE THINGS GO FROM FLOOR TO CEILING ALONG THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE BUILDING 
AND EFFECTIVELY AT THE END OF THE DAY 
YOU GET THE EQUIVALENT OF ELEVEN TENNIS COURTS' WORTH OF STORAGE 
ISN'T THAT EXTRAORDINARY NOW I'M AFTER MY CERAMIC 
HERE WE ARE LOOK OH TWO DOMESTIC POTTERY AND ORNAMENTS 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK INSIDE THERE AND SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT 
JUST LOOK WHAT'S OPENED UP A WHOLE WORLD OF AMAZING SHELVES 
AND HERE IT IS MY LONG LOST GEORDIE WORK OF ART 
YOU MIGHT SAY IT'S ONLY MADE OF OLD BROKEN SHARDS OF POTTERY 
HOW CAN I DESCRIBE THIS AS A WORK OF ART 
THEY'VE TAKEN A PIECE OF A BROKEN GERMAN BISCUIT MANTELPIECE FIGURE 
AND ARTFULLY PLASTERED A WHOLE MOSAIC TO COVER A CORE 
WHICH IS AFTER ALL ONLY A CHEAP TIN TEA TRAY 
IT'S A GREAT OBJECT 
SO HOW MANY OBJECTS WILL THEY MANAGE TO CRAM INTO THE AUCTION ROOM EH 
MUSIC SOUNDS BETTER WITH YOU BY STARDUST 
IT'S VERY VERY NICE TO BE IN TENNANT'S SALE ROOM IN LEYBURN WITH THE BOSS RODNEY TENNANT 
MORNING RODNEY GOOD MORNING TIM YOU IN GOOD VOICE 
YES I AM AT THE MOMENT AT THE END OF THE SALE I MIGHT NOT BE 
EXCELLENT CHRIS AND LOUISE THE FIRST ITEM FOR THEM IS THIS WEE SANDWICH BOX 
LET ME HAVE A LOOK AT THIS ONE IT'S SAID TO BE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
SILVER SHEFFIELD VICTORIAN HEAD ON THERE VICTORIAN MARK 
I RATHER LIKE THESE OBJECTS IT'S WELL 
I LIKE THEM AS WELL BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY USE ONE 
MAYBE ON THE HUNTING FIELD 
YES IT'S WHY THEY WERE SO SLIM IN THOSE DAYS IF YOU HAD YOUR LUNCH OUT OF THAT LITTLE BOX 
THAT WAS IT IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D BE AS THIN 
AS A PENCIL BY THE END OF THE DAY YES 
IT'S WORTH MORE THAN THE FORTY TO SIXTY THAT I THINK WE MAY GET FOR IT 
IS THAT WHAT YOUR ESTIMATE IS FORTY TO SIXTY I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO 
I DON'T WANT TO SURPRISE YOU HERE BUT ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE WAS PAID 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY ISN'T IT THAT'S NEARER RETAIL PRICE THAN AN AUCTION PRICE 
YES I'D BE SURPRISED IF IT MADE MORE THAN SIXTY 
WE'RE SMELLING A BIT OF A LOSS ON THAT ANYWAY 
THE NEXT IS AN INTERESTING LITTLE GROUP OF SORT OF FIRST WORLD WAR PERIOD ITEMS 
THEY'VE GOT THE FRAME AND THE MEDALS AND WHAT NOT 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT LOT RODNEY 
I RATHER LIKE IT IT'S SORT OF NOSTALGIC 
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF WOULD HAVE HAD FAMILY THERE 
IN THE SOMME AND IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
IT'S PURE NOSTALGIA THIS I THINK IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING 
AT FIRST I DIDN'T PICK IT UP 
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A LEATHER WALLET NO PARTICULAR INTEREST 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU FIND THEM PAINTED LIKE THIS WITH THE REGIMENTAL RIGHT 
THE CREST AND THE LANCER AND SO ON AND SO FORTH 
I'M NOT THE HEAD OF THE PICTURE DEPARTMENT BUT I'VE SOLD A LOT OF PAINTINGS 
MILITARY PAINTINGS LIKE THIS BY A CHAP CALLED SIMPKIN 
AND TO ME THIS HAND IS VERY MUCH OF THAT QUALITY 
IT'S NOT SIGNED BUT IT'S A PROFESSIONAL HAND YES 
I THINK THAT'S HIGHLY LIKELY IN WHICH CASE 
IT'S A REGIMENTAL MUSEUM PIECE THERE WE GO ISN'T THAT INTERESTING 
IT IS 
BUT OVERALL I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE WHOLE LOT 
COULD MAKE OVER ONE HUNDRED BUT SEVENTY TO NINETY WOULD BE A SENSIBLE ESTIMATE 
NINETY PAID WELL THAT'S FINE IT'S WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF IT ALL ISN'T IT 
IT ALL DEPENDS HOW EXCITED PEOPLE GET ABOUT THE WALLET ISN'T IT 
IT IS REALLY O. K. BRILLIANT 
DO YOU REMEMBER THESE LITTLE BABY PLATES 
THESE ATTWELL TRANSFER DECORATED SHELLEY DISHES 
I DO REMEMBER THEM BUT I DON'T THINK I HAD ONE WITH 
BY LUCY ATTWELL LIKE THIS ONE BUT QUITE COLLECTABLE THOUGH 
YES THEY ARE AGAIN IT'S BACK TO PURE NOSTALGIA ISN'T IT ABSOLUTELY 
TWENTY ISH O. K. THIRTY THEY PAID 
LOOKING AT THIS GROUP DEPENDING ON HOW THE WALLET GETS ON 
I DO FEEL THEY'VE GOT A REAL BIG HOLE THAT'S OPENING UP UNDERNEATH THAT SANDWICH BOX 
SO OVERALL THEY'LL NEED THEIR BONUS BUY LET'S GO AND LOOK AT IT 
NOW LULU AND CHRIS YOU GAVE THE MAESTRO CARLOS THIRTY FIVE 
LOOK AT HIM BLUSHING LIKE A BRIDE 
ANYWAY THIRTY FIVE HE SPENT ALL OF IT SOME OF IT REVEAL ALL 
ALL SPENT TIM ON A WONDERFUL OBJECT 
LOOK AT THAT OH RIGHT 
IT HAS PROVENANCE IT HAS PEDIGREE 
THIS OBJECT CHRIS IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS OLD REALLY 
IT'S HAD A NEW HANDLE IT'S HAD A WONDERFUL OLD REPLACED WHITE METAL SPOUT MM HMM 
IT'S CHINESE IT'S CHI'EN LUNG AND IT'S EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
WILL THE RESTORATIONS MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE PRICE 
I THINK IT GIVES IT CHARM IT GIVES IT A CERTAIN 
LIKE IT'S BEEN LOVED ABSOLUTELY 
HERE WE GO AGAIN IT COST ME THIRTY FIVE 
IF IT DOESN'T MAKE THAT AND A BIT MORE I SHALL BE AMAZED RIGHT 
I THINK YOU LIKE IT LULU DON'T YOU YOU DON'T 
WELL THAT'S QUITE CLEAR I THINK YOU LIKE IT CHRIS 
IT'S INTERESTING THERE WE GO GOOD WORD INTERESTING 
IT'S KIND OF I WOULD STOP WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD 
IT'S CERTAINLY BATTERED 
USED YES 
THAT'S IT IT'S OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD SO IT'S GOING TO BE USED ISN'T IT 
WOULD YOU BUY A BIT OF USED CHINA FROM THIS MAN THAT'S THE QUESTION YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF 
AND IF YOU WOULD YOU'LL GO WITH HIM 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE NOW BUT AFTER THE SALE OF YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS 
FOR VIEWERS AT HOME LET'S HEAR WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS OF THE TEAPOT 
SO THERE WE GO RODNEY RIGHT RATHER A HANDSOME THING I'D SAY 
WELL IT IS I THINK THIS IS THE EARLIEST OBJECT THAT I'VE SEEN TODAY 
IT'S CHINESE PORCELAIN MADE IN THE REIGN OF EMPEROR KANG HI 
IT'S PROBABLY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY IN DATE 
ALWAYS A VERY PRIZED ITEM TEA 
DON'T FORGET TEA WAS IN CADDIES LOCKED WITH THE KEY SO NOBODY COULD STEAL THE TEA 
HENCE WHEN THIS GOT DAMAGED AND THE TEAPOT SPOUT WENT THEY REPLACED IT WITH A SILVER ONE 
A SILVERSMITH CAME IN AND MADE IT 
THAT'S HOW MUCH THEY TREASURED THIS POT AT THE TIME THAT IT WAS DONE 
THE HANDLE HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH A NON BURN HANDLE 
IF ANYBODY WANTED AN ACADEMIC PIECE FOR THEIR COLLECTION THEY SHOULD CERTAINLY PAY 
THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY FIVE IN THE AUCTION TODAY FOR THAT THEY SHOULD 
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING TO US TO SEE HOW MUCH YOU DO SELL IT FOR IN THE AUCTION YES 
GOOD FUN THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS NOW FOR THE BLUES 
SIMON AND NAOMI

FIFTY TO SEVENTY 
SIXTY PAID YES IT'S GOT TO BE THAT SORT OF MONEY HASN'T IT 
ANYWAY WE'RE NOT FORESEEING A HUGE PROFIT OR HUGE LOSS HOPEFULLY ON THAT WHICH IS NICE 
I KNOW YOU'RE VERY KEEN ON WINTER SPORTS RODNEY AND YOU TRAVEL ALL THE WHILE TO FOREIGN LANDS
