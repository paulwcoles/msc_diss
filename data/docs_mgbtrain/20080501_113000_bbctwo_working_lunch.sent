LOT OF PEOPLE WILL INVEST FOUR THOUSAND 
THAT'S HOW IT STARTED THEN IT 
JUST IT GREW AND GREW 
THE CALLS 
COULD COME FROM ANY OF DOZENS OF 
COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD BUT 
MOST OF THEM COME FROM SPAIN IT IS 
A SHADY BUSINESS WHICH THRIVES ON 
YOUNG BRITONS WHO FLOCKED TO 
BARCELONA MADRID AND THE COAST 
LOOKING FOR CASUAL WORK OUR 
INFORMANT HAS BEEN SELLING SHARES 
FROM SPAIN FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND 
CLAIMS THIS BOGUS INDUSTRY HAS 
REACHED A MIND BOGGLING SIZE HE 
AGREED TO OPEN THE DOOR TO THE 
BOILER ROOMS IF WE KEPT HIS 
IDENTITY DISGUISED 
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK ARE 
WORKING FOR THE BOILER ROOMS OUT 
THERE 
IN SPAIN THOUSANDS IF YOU THERE GO SOMEWHERE LIKE BARCELONA IN THE 
WINTER AND ALL THE TOURISTS ARE 
GONE IF YOU GO INTO A BAR AND THEY 
SPEAK ENGLISH THEY ARE DOING THIS 
JOB OR MAYBE REAL ESTATE BUT THE 
MAJORITY DO THIS THERE'S THOUSANDS 
OF THEM THAT'S JUST SPAIN HE HE SHOWED ME LEAD BOOK LISTS OF 
NAMES AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS CULLED 
FROM SHAREHOLDER REGISTERS IN THE 
U. K. THE ENTRIES INCLUDE INTERESTS 
TO TALK ABOUT SUCH AS FAVOURITE 
CARS AND PETS INFORMATION GLEANED 
BY PREVIOUS CALLERS ALL OF THESE 
AT TARGETS TO SELL WORTHLESS SHARES 
TOO 
IT'S EASY MONEY O. K. IT'S A TOO REJECTION GAME AND A TOUGH GAME TO 
SURVIVE IN BUT IF YOU'RE GOOD AT 
IT THE MONEY IS ENDLESS A LOT OF 
PEOPLE AREN'T HAPPY AND IT DOESN'T 
SETTLE TOO WELL WITH THEM BUT WHEN 
AT THE END OF THE MONDAY BOSS COMES 
OVER AND SAYS WE JUST MADE A 
TRANSFERRED TO YOUR ACCOUNT OF 
FORDY GRAND IT SOON SHUTS YOU UP 
FORTY GRAND 
A TYPICAL SPANISH 
BOILER ROOM HAS TWENTY SALES PEOPLE 
WORKING THE PHONES ANY MORE AND 
THEY RISK ATTRACTING TOO MUCH 
ATTENTION AND BEING CLOSED DOWN 
THERE IS A FLOOR MANAGER IN CHARGE 
AND TO LOOK AFTER EACH TEAM OF TEN 
DEREK TWO CHIEF DEALERS WORKING AS 
A SECOND VOICE WHICH IS BASICALLY 
BACK UP IF A SALESMAN HAD A DEAD 
END WITH AN INTENDED VICTIM THE 
SALESMEN ARE MOSTLY BETWEEN AT SIXTEEN 
AND TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD SUCKED INTO A 
SUPPOSEDLY GLAMOROUS LIFESTYLE OF 
SAM ALCOHOL AND GETTING RICH QUICK 
THEY GO OUT FOR EXTENDED HOLIDAYS 
WORK IN A BAR FOR SUMMER LIKE IT 
AND WANT TO STAY ON THEY CAN SEE 
SOME OF US WALKING ROUND WITH TWENTY 
GRAND WATCHERS ON NOT A CARE IN 
THE WORLD EARNING STUPID MONEY 
BUT THE SALESMAN IN THE BOILER ROOM 
OF TWO LOADERS OFTEN HIGHLY 
EXPERIENCED EX CITY TRADERS ONCE 
ONE OF THE TEAM HAVE CONNED SOMEONE 
INTO THE FIRST SALE A LOTAH WILL 
MOVE INTO BELIEVE THE TARGET OF THE 
REST OF HIS SAVINGS 
WHAT THESE 
GUYS WOULD DO AS RIPPER AND APART 
ABSOLUTELY RIP THEM APART YOU 
MIGHT TAKE SOME ON FOR TEN GRAND 
BALL WEEKS LATER AND A LOADER HAS 
JUST GOT HALF A MILLION OF THEM 
BUT THE BOILER ROOM HASN'T FINISHED 
WITH THE VICTIM YET 
SOME OF THE 
DEALERS ON THE FLOOR ARE SLOPPY 
THEIR JOB IS TO HASSLE INVESTORS 
WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN RIPPED OFF 
AIMING TO WHEEDLE MORE MONEY OUT OF 
THEM BY INVENTING FICTITIOUS BUYERS 
FOR THEIR DUD SHARES IN EXCHANGE 
FOR AN UPFRONT FEE 
THAT'S A BRIDE 
STEALING AT LEAST WITH THE STOCK 
THEY DO GET SOMETHING FOR THEIR 
MONEY THOUGH IT'S MISLEADING THEY 
ARE ACTUALLY PURCHASING STOCK MOST 
OF THE TIME WITH SLOPPING THERE 
IS NO INTENTION YOU ARE GETTING 
ANYTHING YOU'RE STEALING MONEY 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A SHARE 
CERTIFICATE OR ANYTHING INVESTORS INVESTORS WHO CENT OF THEIR CHEQUES TO THE 
BOILER ROOMS OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS WILL 
USUALLY NEVER SEE THEIR MONEY AGAIN 
EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT HAVE AN 
IMPRESSIVE LOOKING SHARE 
CERTIFICATE AS PROOF OF THEIR SO 
CALLED INVESTMENT THE LOSSES RANGE 
FROM THOUSANDS OF POUNDS TO 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF POUNDS AND 
MORE THE SITUATION IS GETTING SO 
SERIOUS THAT THE CITY OF LONDON 
POLICE IS CALLING THIS THE MOST 
SERIOUS FINANCIAL THREAT FACING 
MIDDLE RANKING HOUSEHOLDS THE 
SALESMAN CONCENTRATE THEIR PATTER 
ON BUSINESSES SUCH AS MINING WHICH 
HOLD OUT THE HOPE OF SEVEN FINES 
AND INSTANT PROFITS ALSO SHARES 
SUPPOSEDLY IN FRONTLINE 
TECHNOLOGIES SECTORS AND THE 
INTERNET AROUND WHICH THEY CAN 
SPIN A TEMPTING STORY BUT USUALLY 
BEHIND THE HYPE ARE A SHAM 
COMPANIES DOING AND EARNING NOTHING 
IT IS A THEFT TO GET MONEY INTO 
THAT SORT OF THING YES IT IS 
IT'S DECEPTION MORE THAN ANYTHING 
BECAUSE THEY ARE RECEIVING SHARES 
IN A COMPANY WITH REGISTRATION 
NUMBER WHERE THEY CAN RING UP 
REGISTRAR AND PHYSICALLY CHECKED 
BUT SOME OF THE U. K. STOCKS WE SELL 
THEY CAN RUN OF LLOYD'S THE MAJOR 
REGISTRAR AND SAY MR. JOHN SMITH 
YOU HOLD TEN THOUSAND SHARES BUT THEY 
WILL VERY RARELY GET ANY MONEY BACK 
IN RECENT YEARS BOILER ROOMS HAVE 
CONCENTRATED ON SHOW AT SELLING 
SHARES ON OBSCURE U. S. COMPANIES 
WHICH OFTEN HAVE NO VALUE ON CAN'T 
BE SOLD ON BY THE INVESTOR BECAUSE 
OF LEGAL RESTRICTIONS NOW THEY ARE 
MOVING TO INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS 
OF SHARES IN START UP BUSINESSES 
WITH FANCY WEBSITES BUT NO MONEY 
EARNING ACTIVITIES AND MOST 
WORRYINGLY INTO CLONED SHARES 
WHAT HAS COPIES OF SHARES IN WELL 
KNOWN INTERNATIONAL CORPORATIONS 
WORTHLESS COPIES 
WE CAN OPEN UP A 
BANK ACCOUNT IN PANAMA AND THE 
BUSINESS ACCOUNT NAME IS GOOGLE SO 
IN EFFECT THEY ARE SENDING THEIR 
MONEY'S TO THEM JUST HOURS NOT 
THEIRS 
BRITAIN'S FINANCIAL THEIRS SERVICES AUTHORITY BASED IN LONDON 
ESTIMATES THE TOTAL COST OF BOILER 
ROOMS TO U. K. INVESTORS BY 
EXTRAPOLATING FROM THE NUMBERS OF 
COMPLAINTS IT GETS THIS IS CLEARLY 
A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM THE SIZE OF 
THE PROBLEM WE KNOW ABOUT HIS FORTY 
MILLION BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IS 
THE TIP OF AN ICEBERG 
THE FIGURE FOR BOILER ROOM TAKINGS 
IS BASED ON THE TWO THOUSAND COMPLAINTS IT 
RECEIVES EVERY YEAR FROM INVESTORS 
WHO PROVIDE DETAILS OF LOSSES 
ADDING UP TO THAT FORTY MILLION THE 
F. S. A. SAYS THIS INDICATES TOTAL 
ANNUAL LOSSES OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION 
BASED ON ITS EXPERIENCE OF OTHER 
SCAMS BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL 
HUNDRED BOILER ROOMS CURRENTLY 
TARGETING U. K. INVESTORS FROM SPAIN 
AND ELSEWHERE OUR INFORMANT IS 
CONVINCED FROM HIS INSIDER'S 
VIEWPOINT THAT THE F. S. A. IS 
DRASTICALLY UNDERESTIMATING THE 
SCALE OF THE PROBLEM 
THE AVERAGE 
SHOT IF YOU ARE DECENT YOU'RE 
WRITING A MILLION A WEEK THE FIRST 
EIGHT WEEKS IT TAKES YOU TO GET 
THERE THEN YOU ARE WRITING A 
MILLION A WEEK A MILLION POUNDS 
EVERY WEEK 
IN TOTAL WHAT YOU 
THINK IS GOING OUT OF THE U. K. BUT 
THESE SORTS OF BOILER ROOMS 
WITHOUT SITTING DOWN AND WORKING 
OUT THE MATH BUT IT'S A BILLION 
POUND INDUSTRY EVERY YEAR 
I THINK 
EVERYBODY IS DOING HERE IS GUESSING 
AT THE BIT OF THE ICEBERG THAT IS 
BELOW THE WATER YOU CAN'T ARGUE 
WITH ESTIMATES THERE IS A CERTAIN 
LOGIC APPLIED TO THEM L. THINK I AM 
ACCEPTING THAT IT IS A VERY BIG 
PROBLEM WHETHER IT IS TWO HUNDRED MILLION 
OR SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION IT'S 
DIFFICULT TO SAY BECAUSE EVERYONE 
IS GUESSING BEYOND THE FORTY MILLION 
THAT WE DEFINITELY DO KNOW ABOUT L. 
DON'T QUIBBLE BUT NEITHER CAN I 
FULLY ACCEPT 
ACCORDING TO ONE CITY 
OF LONDON 
SPECIALISING IN 
OF LONDON SOLICITOR SPECIALISING IN FRAUD THERE IS AN EXPLANATION FOR 
THE F. S. A.'S LOW FIGURE MANY 
INVESTORS DON'T YET KNOW THEY HAVE 
LOST OUT THEY STILL THINK THEIR 
SHARES ARE WORTH SOMETHING AND 
MANY OTHERS BLAME THEMSELVES AND 
KEEP QUIET 
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW 
EMBARRASSING IT IS TO FIND AS AN 
EXPERIENCED INVESTOR YOU SUCCUMB 
TO THE PATTER AND HARD SELL TACTICS 
OF A BOILER ROOM SALESMAN ONLY TO 
SEE YOUR HARDENED INVESTMENT CASH 
GOING DOWN THE PAN BECAUSE THE 
SHARES ARE WORTHLESS OR THE BOILER 
ROOM JUST TAKES THE MONEY AND RUNS 
STOPPING IT IS NIGH ON IMPOSSIBLE 
BECAUSE THE F. S. A. THE GOVERNMENT 
HAVE NEVER TRIED TO GET ON TOP OF 
IT NOW THE BEAST IS TOO BIG YOU 
CAN'T CUT THE HEAD OF SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT THE WORLD AS A SMALL 
PLACE YOU STOP IT IN SPAIN 
EVERYONE IS MOVING TO BRAZIL WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR OWN FEELINGS ABOUT WHAT'S 
GOING ON 
THE INDUSTRY WILL NEVER 
CLOSE THERE'S TOO MUCH MONEY TO BE 
LOST NO MATTER WHAT I DO OR WHAT 
ANYBODY DOES THIS INDUSTRY WILL 
ALWAYS BE GOING THERE IS TOO MUCH 
MONEY 
KEN AND BARBARA HAVE SENT MONEY THEIR SHARES TO A LOCAL STOCKBROKER 
IN DORSET IN THE HOPE THAT THEY CAN 
GET SOMETHING BACK THEY WANT 
OTHERS TO LEARN FROM THEIR 
EXPERIENCE 
I WOULDN'T BUY ANYTHING EXPERIENCE FROM SOMEBODY WHO RINGS A PERSON 
OUT OF THE BLUE WE WERE DRAWN IN 
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS SOMEBODY 
FROM ANOTHER COMPANY THAT WE'VE 
DEALT WITH IN THE PAST BUT IF YOU 
DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE JUST DON'T 
BUY THEM 
I'D TELL THEM TO CHECK 
EVERYTHING MAKE SURE IT'S A 
REPUTABLE DEALER BECAUSE THIS IS 
SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO 
THE POLICE 
HAVE CONFIRMED TO ME THAT THEY 
BELIEVE THAT LOSSES FROM BOILER 
ROOM FRAUD ARE MUCH LARGER THAN HAS 
PREVIOUSLY BEEN THOUGHT THEY PUT 
THE FIGURE AT AT LEAST HALF A 
BILLION POUNDS AND PROBABLY MORE 
THAN THAT OF WHICH PUTS IT AHEAD 
OF FRAUD FROM DEBIT CARDS AND 
CREDIT CARDS AND THE BIGGEST FRAUD 
AFFECTING LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE 
IN BRITAIN TODAY SIMON IS HERE TO 
GIVE US MORE L. UNDERSTAND YOU GOT 
SOME INFORMATION FROM THE CITY 
REGULATOR THE F. S. A. 
YES THEY HAVE 
GIVEN ME A LIST TODAY OF THE BOILER 
ROOMS THAT ARE MOST ACTIVE AT THE 
MOMENT THEY'RE GETTING MOST 
COMPLAINTS ABOUT THEM LET'S GO 
THROUGH THE LIST IT WILL BE ON OUR 
WEBSITE LATER THIS AFTERNOON IF 
YOU HAVE BEEN PHONED BY ANY OF 
THESE PEOPLE 
THE ANSWER IS TO TAKE GREAT CARE 
THE F. S. A. WOULD SAY DON'T CONTINUED 
TALKING TO THEM PUT THE PHONE DOWN 
IT'S ALSO WORTH MENTIONING THAT ON 
THE F. S. A.'S WEBSITE AND YOU CAN 
TELEPHONE THEM AS WELL THERE IS A 
LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT BOILER 
ROOMS IT WARNS YOU ABOUT TO BE 
CAREFUL ABOUT THE CITY OF LONDON 
POLICE ARE LOOKING INTO THIS FROM 
THE CRIMINALITY POINT OF VIEW 
THAT LIST YOU GAVE A LOT OF THEM 
SOUND SIMILAR TO PROPER COMPANIES 
IT'S ONE OF THE TRICKS THAT THEY 
CHOOSE THESE NAMES THAT ARE VERY 
SIMILAR TO NAMES YOU ARE SORT OF 
HALF FAMILIAR WITH 
THIS IS A 
MASSIVE WHAT HAS SURPRISED ME IS 
THAT THIS IS ONE IF NOT THE 
BIGGEST FRAUD IN THIS COUNTRY 
YOU'VE GOT MORE ABOUT THIS TOMORROW 
MORE DETAILED TOMORROW FIRST OF 
ALL ABOUT THE COMMISSION'S AND 
EARNINGS THAT SOME OF THESE BOILER 
ROOM OPERATORS ARE MAKING BUT ALSO 
ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT OVER THE PHONE 
WHAT THE PATTER IS GOING TO BE LIKE 
AND WHAT THEIR TACTICS ARE WE WILL 
BE LOOKING AT WHY THEY AREN'T EASY 
TO CATCH WHY THE CONCH OF THEM 
DOWN 
I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE DOWN ALREADY E. MAILING ABOUT IT

PROGRAMME PAWNBROKERS WITH THEIR 
QUICK CASH DEALS ARE DOING WELL OUT 
OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH JENNY SHAW

FINANCIAL SERVICES COVERING 
PAWNBROKING CHEQUE CASHING WE CAN 
HAVE PAID A ADVANCES ADVANCING 
PEOPLE ON THEIR SALARY CASH CASH CONVERTERS IS AN AUSTRALIAN COMPANY 
THAT CAME TO THE U. K. FIFTEEN YEARS AGO 
THERE ARE NOW AROUND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FRANCHISES 
INCLUDING THIS ONE IN WOOLWICH THE 
FRONT AND THE BACK OF THE SHOP IS 
LIKE AN ELECTRICAL ALADDIN'S CAVE 
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING FROM 
PROFESSIONAL D. J. DECKS SAT NAV AND 
DIGITAL CAMERAS PEOPLE BRING THESE 
GOODS IN AND MAKE PURCHASE 
AGREEMENTS ON THEM FROM AS LITTLE 
AS TWO UP TO THREE THOUSAND SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE 
BUSINESS IN WHICH REVOLVES AROUND 
SOMETHING CALLED BUY BACK IT 
INVOLVES CASH CONVERTERS 
TEMPORARILY BUYING GOODS OF VIEW ON 
THE PREMISE YOU BUY THEM BACK IT 
IS ITEMS TRADITIONALLY PAWNBROKERS 
WON'T TAKE ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS 
THAT UNLIKE JULIE JURY WILL 
PROBABLY LOSE THEIR VALUE YOU THEN 
HAVE THE RIGHT TO BUY THEM BACK 
WITHIN TWENTY EIGHT DAYS THEY PERFORM CREDIT 
SHOULD THE DO NOT PERFORM CREDIT 
CHECKS BUT THEY DO ASK FOR 
IDENTIFICATION 
WE GET A LOT OF OLD IDENTIFICATION CUSTOMERS AND ALSO NEW CUSTOMERS 
THEY KEEP COMING BACK SO THE NEW 
CUSTOMERS BECOME REGULAR CUSTOMERS 
I HEARD PEOPLE USING FIRST NAMES 
YES IT IS LIKE A FAMILY BUSINESS 
A LOT OF LIVELIHOODS DEPEND ON 
COMING IN THE MONEY WE GIVE THEM 
THEY MIGHT BE SHORT FOR MONEY FOR 
BILLS WE CAN GIVE THEM A LITTLE 
LOAN TO TIDE THEM OVER UNTIL THE 
WAGES COME IN 
I AM UNEMPLOYED AT 
THE MOMENT L. L. NEED TO GET SOME MONEY 
DO YOU USE THE BUY BACK MONEY SERVICE 
YES ALL THE TIME THERE SERVICE THERE IS NO DENYING SOME PEOPLE VIEW IT 
AS VALUABLE SEEN BUSINESS BUT 
IT IS SERIOUS BUSINESS IF YOU 
ARE GIVEN ONE HUNDRED FOR YOUR ITEM TWENTY EIGHT 
DAYS LATER OR ANY TIME BEFORE THEN 
CASH CONVERTERS WILL ASK YOU FOR 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TO BUY IT BACK THIRTY PER CENT IS THE 
STANDARD CHARGE IF YOU DO NOT 
COLLECT IT IT IS PUT UP FOR SALE

STREETS SHOPS STRUGGLE THIS ONE IS 
BUCKING THE TREND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN SALES 
FOR CASH CONVERTERS IN THE U. K. GREW

THE WAY THEY OPERATE MEAN SOME 
CUSTOMERS WORK AND GETTING A 
DIFFERENT DEAL THAN THEY WOULD FROM 
THEIR LOCAL BANK MANAGER WHO 
STANDARD HIGH STREET STORE 
IT IS 
LIKE A MARKET WITHIN THESE WALLS 
NO DISRESPECT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE 
THEY COME FROM COUNTRIES WERE PART 
AND PARCEL OF EVERYDAY SHOPPING IS 
HAGGLING THEY MAY SAY SOME 
RIDICULOUS PRICES BUT YOU HAVE TO 
GET ON WITH IT 
HOW DO YOU GET 
YOURSELF A GOOD DEAL ON A BUY BACK 
AT CASH CONVERTERS 
MAKE SURE THE 
GOODS ARE CLEAN IF IT IS WELL 
PRESENTED WE WILL PAY MORE MONEY 
BE REALISTIC DON'T COME IN LOOKING 
FOR TONS OF MONEY COME IN LOOKING 
FOR A REALISTIC PRICE 
PORT IS 
EXPECTING A GOOD YEAR IN WHICH THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH IS MAKING BUSINESSES 
LIKE THIS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR 
AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
A RAY OF SUNSHINE IN THE ECONOMIC 
GLOOM SURROUNDS ANNUITY RATES 
WHICH ARE CRUCIAL IF YOU ARE TAKING 
YOUR PENSION THEY ARE RISING 
DESPITE THE CREDIT CRUNCH THERE IS 
A FIVE YEAR HIGH THIS COULD BE 
GOOD NEWS IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO 
RETIRE WE WILL BE FINDING OUT MORE 
ABOUT THAT CURRENT MARKET BUT WE 
NEED A KNOW ALL TO TELL US WHAT AN 
ANNUITY IS AN WYVER BY NEWS OF 
RISING WHERE CAN WE FIND ONE OF 
THOSE THOSE AN ANNUITY A PROMISE TO PAY 
SOMEONE A REGULAR INCOME FOR THE 
REST OF THEIR LIVES PEOPLE THINK 
THEY LIVE OFF THEIR PENSIONS THEY 
DON'T THEY SAVED INTO A PENSION 
WHEN THEY RETIRE THEY USE THE 
MAJORITY OF THE PENSION TO BUY THAT 
ANNUITY IT IS EFFECTIVE A BET ON 
HOW LONG YOU WILL LIVE IF YOU HAVE 
TO LIVE OFF YOUR SAVINGS THERE IS 
A DANGER THE MONEY WOULD RUN OUT 
BEFORE YOU DIED BUT WITH AN 
ANNUITY THERE IS NO RISK THEY 
PROMISED TO PAY YOU A REGULAR 
AMOUNT FOR HOWEVER LONG YOU LIVE 
THEY ARE BETTING ON YOUR LIFE IF 
YOU DIE TOMORROW THEY WOULD HAVE 
ALL YOUR SAVINGS AND YOU THEY 
WOULD HAVE PAID YOU HARDLY ANYTHING 
AT ALL IF YOU LIVED UNTIL ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY YOU A REGULAR 
AMOUNT EVEN IF THEY ARE MAKING A 
LOSS EITHER WAY YOU DO NOT WORRY 
BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS TAKING THE 
RISK NOT YOU THE DEAL YOU GET A 
RETIREMENT IS THE DEAL YOU GET FOR 
LIFE THE PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE IS 
THE MONEY THEY GET DOES DEPEND ON 
THE DEAL THEY GET TO THE POINT THEY 
RETIRE SO IF THE DEAL IS BAD THEY 
ARE STUCK WITH IT FOR EVER THE 
GOOD NEWS THE DEALS PEOPLE ARE 
GETTING RIGHT NOW ARE GOOD HERE 
HIS WIFE THE COMPANIES WHICH SELL 
ANNUITIES FUND THEM BY INVESTING 
IN BOMBS THE CREDIT CRUNCH HAS 
PUSHED DOWN THE PRICE OF BOMBS NOT 
GOOD NEWS ON THE FACE OF IT BUT 
THAT IS GOOD AS THE PRICE OF IT 
FALLS THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE 
IT PAYS INCREASES SO YOU HAVE THIS 
INVERSE RELATIONSHIP SO AS THE 
PRICE FALLS THE RATE RISES SO LET 
ME EXPLAIN ASSUME YOU HAVE A ONE 
BOND IT PAYS A FIXED PAYMENT OF TWO P. 
A YEAR THAT IS OBVIOUSLY TWO PER CENT AND 
THAT IS TERRIBLE A BOND IS AND I 
KNOW YOU THEY HAVE BORROWED MURRAY 
AND PROMISES TO PAY IT BACK WITH 
INTEREST LET'S SAY I GET NICKED TO 
BUY IT OFF ME L. OFFER HIM THE ONE 
BOND NOT FOR ONE BUT FOR FIFTY PENCE 
HE PAYS FIFTY PENCE BUT HE STILL GETS 
THE TWO P. IN YEAR INTEREST THE 
EFFECTIVE RATE HAS GONE UP TO FOUR PER CENT 
THERE IS THE PRICE AS IT FALLS 
THE INTEREST RATE RISES THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED THEIR 
PRICES ARE FALLING THE INTEREST 
RATE IS RISING AND ANNUITY RATES 
ARE RISING AS WELL 
WE CAN NOW TALK TO NIGEL CALLAGHAN 
A PENSIONS ANALYST AT HARGREAVES 
LONGSTOWE WHY ARE THESE BOMBS ARE 
FALLING FALLING IT IS LARGELY DOWN TO MARKET 
CONFIDENCE SINCE THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
OF LAST SUMMER THE CONFIDENCE HAS 
EVAPORATED IN THE CORPORATE BOND 
MARKET AND DRIVEN DOWN THE COST AND 
AS HAS JUST BEEN EXPLAINED THAT 
HAS INCREASED THE YIELD OR INCOME 
FROM THOSE BOMBS THAT IS GREAT 
NEWS FOR ANNUITIES AND THOSE PEOPLE 
RETIRING BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW 
PUSHING FIVE YEAR HIGH 
IT IS A 
CRUCIAL MOMENT WHEN YOU CASH IN AND 
GO FOR AN ANNUITY BECAUSE YOU HAVE 
TO STICK WITH IT THE GENERAL 
ADVICE IS IF YOU CAN DO AN ANNUITY 
DO IT RIGHT NOW 
ABSOLUTELY THE 
ANNUITY RATES YOU CAN BUY TODAY 
THEY ARE ELEVEN PER CENT HIGHER THAN YOU COULD 
HAVE BOUGHT TWO YEARS AGO WHO 
KNOWS WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS BUT 
YOU KNOW YOU ARE GETTING A GOOD 
DEAL IF YOU ARE COMING UP TO 
RETIREMENT NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO 
DO IT THE RATE YOU BUY IS NOT JUST 
FOR TODAY IT IS FOR EVER UNTIL YOU 
DIE 
TO GET THIS STRAIGHT THERE IS DIE OFTEN A LOT OF CONCRETE CONFUSION 
IT IS A ONE OFF TRANSACTION BUT 
YOU HAVE A BROAD WINDOW FOR WHEN 
YOU ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE IT FROM 
WHEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT IS THAT 
RIGHT 
YOU CAN RETIRE FROM ANY RIGHT POINT FROM FIFTY UP TO SEVENTY FIVE AND YOU CAN 
CHOOSE AT ANY POINT TO DO THAT YOU 
DON'T HAVE TO CONVERT OR YOUR 
PENSION SAVINGS INTO AN ANNUITY 
IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN CONVERT HALF 
OF THEM NOW AND THE OTHER HALF IN A 
FEW YEARS' TIME 
YOU OBVIOUSLY 
HAVING TROUBLE WITH YOUR EARPIECE 
NOW CAN WE LOOK FORWARD BECAUSE WE 
ARE HEARING TODAY FROM AMERICA AND 
FROM THIS COUNTRY SOME PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING THE CREDIT CRUNCH IS ALL 
OVER WE WILL BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE 
SEE IT IF YOU THINK THE MARKET IS 
GOING DOWN OR IF YOU THINK IT IS 
GOING UP HOW WILL THAT INFLUENCE 
THE ANNUITY MARKET AND THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VALUE AND 
THE YIELD 
AS YOU SAY THINGS THAT 
ARE TRACKING DOWN INTEREST RATES 
HIS LIFE EXPECTANCY WE ARE LIVING 
LONGER AND THAT TENDS TO PUSH DOWN 
ANNUITY RATES BECAUSE YOUR PENSION 
SAVINGS HAVE TO LAST LONGER AND 
ALSO CORPORATE BOND FUND MANAGERS 
REALLY THINK CORPORATE BOND PRICES 
ARE AT AN ALL TIME LOW ALL MARKET 
IS FACTORED IN LOTS OF BAD NEWS 
IF THEY ARE RIGHT CORPORATE BOND 
PRICES ARE LIKELY TO RISE WHICH 
WILL TRACK DOWN THE YIELD SPREAD 
AND ULTIMATELY ANNUITY RATES ON 
THE OTHER HAND IF THE ECONOMY DOES 
NOSEDIVE CONFIDENCE COULD 
EVAPORATE COMPANIES AND 
INDIVIDUALS COULD FACE EVEN MORE 
DIFFICULTIES BORROWING MONEY ALL 
THAT COULD FEED THROUGH TO 
INFLATIONARY FEARS WHICH COULD 
PUSH UP ANNUITY RATES 
SO YOU THINK 
IT IS GOING TO COME DOWN YES 
LOTS OF E. MAILS PHILIPPA HE SAYS 
WHEN SHE GETS CALLS FROM THESE 
SCAMMERS SHE TELLS THEM THAT HER 
HUSBAND AS RAN OFF WITH ANOTHER 
WOMAN THAT STOPS THEM IN THEIR 
TRACKS TRACKS ALSO LOUISE CALLED ME DURING YOUR 
REPORT I TOLD HIM TO GO AWAY 
GOOD ADVICE SEE YOU TOMORROW AT 
TWELVE THIRTY P. M. TWELVE THIRTY P. M.
