CRUCIFIX AND A ROSARY AND READ THE 
BIBLE HE WAS INCREDIBLY RELIGIOUS

TWO AND A HALF MILLION VISITORS 
EVERY YEAR TWENTY YEAR OLD STEVE COOK 
ARRIVES HERE ON THIRTY FIRST AUGUST TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
WITH GROUP OF FRIENDS 
ON THEIR FIRST NIGHT THEY ARE KEEN 
TO JOIN THE FUN 
THERE WAS A BAR CRAWL THAT WAS 
ORGANISED THAT WE DECIDED AS IT 
WAS FREE WE WOULD JUMP ON IN IT 
WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO FIND OUT 
WHICH WERE THE BEST BARS TO GO TO 
AND THAT FOR THE REST OF THE 
HOLIDAY 
WE WERE HAVING A GOOD TIME HOLIDAY EVERYONE WAS LAUGHING JOKING WE 
HAD A GOOD NIGHT 
LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHER YOUNG 
HOLIDAY MAKERS THE GROUP PARTIED 
FOR HOURS 
JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT I DECIDED THAT 
I'D HAD ENOUGH TO DRINK AND STEVE 
VOLUNTEERED TO COME BACK WITH ME 
MAKE SURE I GOT BACK O. K. ON THE WAY 
BACK TO THE HOTEL STEVE SAID WHY 
DON'T WE HAVE ONE MORE DRINK WE 
WERE NOT FAR FROM THE HOTEL WE 
WENT INTO THIS BAR TO HAVE ONE 
DRINK EACH THE BAR WAS PROPER 
RAMMED TO THE RAFTERS REALLY IT 
WAS REALLY FULL SO I QUICKLY 
LOOKED AROUND TO SEE IF I COULD 
SPOT STEVE IN THE BAR BUT I 
COULDN'T FIND HIM 
ANDY PRESUMES THEY WILL SEE EACH 
OTHER BACK AT THE HOTEL BUT THE 
NEXT MORNING STEVE ISN'T THERE 
ALTHOUGH STEVE GOES MISSING IN 
GREECE BRITISH POLICE LAUNCH THEIR 
OWN INVESTIGATION 
AN AWFUL LOT OF INFORMATION 
SURROUNDING STEVE'S DISAPPEARANCE 
WAS U. K. BASED HE WAS WITH U. K. 
HOLIDAY COMPANY HE WAS WITH A 
GROUP OF FRIENDS SO WE WERE ABLE 
TO PULL TOGETHER A DOSSIER OF 
INTELLIGENCE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN 
A REAL USEFUL STARTING POINT FOR 
THE GREEK POLICE 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO RE TRACE HIS 
STEPS ON THAT NIGHT 
THERE IS WITNESS 
HE WAS LAST SEEN STANDING OUTSIDE A 
PARTICULAR BAR LOOKING FOR 
DIRECTIONS BACK TO THE HOTEL WHICH 
WAS A MATTER ONLY OF A FEW HUNDRED 
YARDS AWAY 
THIS IS THE LAST TIME THAT HE IS 
SEEN THAT NIGHT 
NINE MONTHS PASS WITH NO NEWS THEN 
IN EARLY JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIX SOMETHING 
HAPPENS THAT ADDS TO THE MISERY OF 
THE CASE 
PATH ANSWERS THE PHONE SHE GETS A 
GAR BELLED NOISE I CAN BEST 
EXPLAIN EXPLAIN AND THE PHONE WENT DAD SO PATH 
RANG ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THE MESSAGE WAS 
DIFFERENT TO THE NORMAL MESSAGE OF 
A PHONE CALL IN THE U. K. 
WE TRACED THAT CALL TO AN EXCHANGE 
IN THE DUSL DOR OF AREA OF GERMANY 
THAT CALL COULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY 
ANY PERSON IT COULD HAVE BEEN FROM 
SOMEBODY OFFERING A MESSAGE OF 
SUPPORT ON THE OTHER HAND IT COULD 
HAVE BEEN STEPHEN TRYING TO MAKE 
CONTACT WITH HIS FAMILY IN THE 
ABSENCE OF ANY FIRM EVIDENCE IT IS 
STILL SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE TO 
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF ALTHOUGH THE 
CALL IS TRACKED TO GERMANY THE 
TELEPHONE IT IS MADE FROM IS NO 
LOCATED WHEN TRACED THE DETAILS 
OF THE NUMBER ARE INCONCLUSIVE 
THE COOK'S LIVES HAVE BEEN IN LIMBO 
SINCE SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND FIVE AS THEY WAIT 
FOR NEWS 
STEPHEN IS ALWAYS THERE 
HE ALWAYS WILL BE HE'LL NEVER GO 
AWAY RIGHT NOW IF YOU WERE TO SAY 
TO ME WHAT WOULD YOU WANT MOST OF 
ALL OTHER THAN HIM BEING HERE AND 
MY ANSWER TO YOU WOULD BE JUST LET 
ME KNOW HE'S ALIVE 
JOINING ME NOW IS DEPUTY 
COMMISSIONER RICHARD BRYAN FROM 
ACPO ACPO THERE ARE A DIFFERENT SET OF 
HURDLES TO OVERCOME WHEN SOMEBODY 
GOES MISSING ABROAD 
IF SOMEBODY 
GOES MISSING IN THE U. K. THERE ARE 
ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES WE NEED TO 
START SEARCH THEY GET A SEARCH 
UPBTSDZ WAY THEY MAKE UNDERWAY 
THEY START MAKING ENQUIRIES IF 
SOMEBODY GOES MISSING ABROAD YOU 
ARE DEPENDANT ON INQUIRIES WHICH 
TAKE PLACE OVERSEAS 
COUNTRIES HANDLE THINGS IN 
DIFFERENT WAYS AND HAVE DIFFERENT 
PRIORITIES 
WHEN DO INTERPOL GET PRIORITIES INVOLVED 
INTERPOL IN A WAY THE INVOLVED POLICE FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES 
SPEAK TO EACH OTHER THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX 
COUNTRIES RELATED TO INTERPOL 
INTERPOL WILL CALL THE INQUIRYS TO 
BE CONDUCTED OVER SEAS 
THEY BRIDGE 
THE GAP DO THEY YES 
WE HAVE YES HEARD THEM MENTIONED A FEW TIMES 
IS IT A BIG PROBLEM PEOPLE GOING 
MISSING FROM THE U. K. ABROAD THE THE NUMBERS ARE SMALL BUT THEY ARE 
TRICKY THEY ARE TRICKY BECAUSE YOU 
ARE VERY MUCH IN THE HANDS OF 
PEOPLE OVERSEAS DOING THE ENQUIRIES 
SOME OF THE CASES YOU DEMONSTRATED 
IS PEOPLE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF SELF 
HELP KEEP THINGS ON THE AGENDA 
MOTIVATE THE LOCAL POLICE WHEN 
THEY GET INFORMATION MAKE SURE 
PEOPLE HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT THERE 
IS A LOT OF WORK TO KEEP THESE 
CASES ALIVE 
WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO TO 
KEEP A LONG TERM CASE ALIVE AND IN 
THE PUBLIC EYE 
THESE PROGRAMMES 
ARE ABSOLUTELY INVALUABLE THERE 
ARE A NUMBER ACROSS EUROPE IT IS 
ABOUT MAKING SURE PEOPLE DON'T 
FORGET WHEN THERE ARE SIGHTINGS 
MAKING SURE THE INFORMATION GETS 
OUT IT IS ABOUT ENGAGING WITH THE 
LOCAL POLICE ABOUT ENGAGING WITH 
THE MEDIA THAT IS EASIER SAID THAN 
DONE IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE LANGUAGE 
IT IS THAT KEEP OF WORK THAT KEEPS 
THINGS MOVING EVEN WITH CASES IN 
THE U. K. WHEN PEOPLE GET FOUND 
OFTEN IT IS A PRODUCT OF THE WORK 
THAT THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS HAVE 
DONE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE 
POLICE OR WITH CHARITYS LIKE 
MISSING PEOPLE

THAT C. C. T. V. A LOT OF CALLS HOW ARE 
WE DOING 
THE RESPONSE FROM THE 
PUBLIC HAS BEEN FANTASTIC 
OBVIOUSLY CAPTURED THE PUBLIC'S 
IMAGINATION WE'VE TAKEN TONNES OF 
CALLS EVERY DAY PASSING THEM ON TO 
THE POLICE HIS DAD IS FOLLOWING 
THEM IN REGENT'S PARK AS WELL WE 
NEED TO HEAR MORE 
UNTIL WE GET THE 
CALL THAT COUNTS UNTIL HE IS FOUND 
WE NEED MORE DON'T WE 
SHE IS LISTENING TO THE RADIO AND 
HEARS A MAN HAS GONE MISS FROM THE 
CAIRNGORM MOUNTAINS MAGGIE KNOWS 
INSTANTLY THAT MAN IS HER BROTHER 
THE CAIRNGORMS ARE VERY HIGH OVER 
FOUR THOUSAND FEET IT HAS THE FORM OF A 
HIGH PLATEAU THE WEATHER CAN BE 
VERY SEVERE IN WINTER IN PARTICULAR 
ALMOST HAS THE CHARACTER OF AN 
ARCTIC ENVIRONMENT 
ONE REGULAR 
VISITOR TO THE MOUNTAINS IS CLIMBER 
DAVID AMOS WHOSE HOB BIHAS TAKEN 
HIM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
I JOINED 
THE CLUB ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO 
BEFORE THAT I USED TO WALK MOSTLY 
THROUGHOUT SCOTLAND 
IT IS A CHALLENGE TO COMPLETE THE 
CLIMB DO IT CORRECTLY AND CLIMB 
AT YOUR LIMIT SOMETIMES BUT NOT 
ALWAYS 
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX DAVID JOINS OTHER ALWAYS INTERNATIONAL CLIMBERS AT A MEET ON 
THE EDGE OF THE CAIRNGORMS DESPITE 
POOR WEATHER HE AND THREE OTHERS 
SET OUT FOR A CLIMB 
THERE HAD BEEN 
QUITE A BIT OF SNOW WE WERE NOT 
SURE WHAT WE WOULD DO THE FOUR OF 
US JUST SET OFF IT WAS ABOUT 
EIGHT ZERO ZERO A M. 
AS THEY REACHED 
THE SUMMIT EIGHT HUNDRED A M. THE WEATHER TURNS AGAINST THEM 
THE WIND WAS BLOWING IN OUR FACES 
OUR EYEBROWS WERE FROZEN THERE WAS 
SLOW PROGRESS AND DISORIENTATING 
AND EXHAUSTING 
WHEN THE OTHERS RETURN TO BASE AND 
FIND DAVID'S TEAM ARE NOT THERE 
THEY RAISE THE ALARM 
BECAUSE THEY 
WERE SO EXPERIENCED IT WAS DECIDED 
NOT TO DO ANYTHING THAT'S QUITE 
OFTEN THE CASE IF IT'S EXPERIENCED 
CLIMBERS WE WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT 
MORNING BECAUSE IT'S USUAL FOR 
PEOPLE TO COME BACK AFTER DARK IF 
THEY'RE DOING A BIG CLIMBING ROUTE 
DAVID'S COMPANION AND DAVID ARE 
LOST 
BY THE TIME IT WAS DARK LOST PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED P. M. WE DECIDED 
THAT WE WOULDN'T GET OUT OF THERE 
THAT WE SHOULD STOP AND MAKE 
OURSELVES AS COMFORTABLE AS 
POSSIBLE WE DIDN'T WANT TO SLEEP 
BECAUSE WE FELT IF WE DID SLEEP WE 
MIGHT NOT WAKEN UP 
AS DAWN BREAKS THE SEARCH BEGINS 
AFTER TWELVE HOURS WITH NO CONTACT NO 
ONE KNOWS WHAT THEY MIGHT FIND 
IT WAS A CASE OF EITHER THEY GOT 
LOST OR THEY HAD BEEN AVALANCHED 
WHICH WAS QUITE A STRONG 
POSSIBILITY GIVEN THE CONDITIONS 
THE BLIZZARD MEANS THE HELICOPTER 
CAN'T FLY SO CLIMBERS FROM THE MEET 
JOIN TEAMS FROM THE CAIRN GORM 
MOUNTAIN RESCUE TO SEARCH WHAT 
GROUND THEY CAN COVER MEANWHILE 
BACK HOME IN EDINBURGH DAVID'S 
SISTER MAGGIE GETS IN FROM WORK 
I PUT THE RADIO IN AS SOON AS I GOT 
IN THE DOOR IT WAS THE FOUR HUNDRED P. M. NEWS 
I HEARD ON THE RADIO THERE WAS TWO 
CLIMBERS MISSING L. KNEW 
IMMEDIATELY THAT IT WAS HIM I I PHONED BILLY HE SAID HE KNEW HE 
SAID I THINK YOU SHOULD BE 
PREPARED FOR THE WORST IT'S IT'S ARCTIC UP THERE IT'S A ROTTEN 
ROTTEN PLACE TO BE YOU LOSE WHERE 
YOU ARE SOMETIMES IF IT'S REALLY 
BAD FROM WHAT I KNEW THAT WAS THE 
CONDITIONS THEY WERE IN IT WAS 
REALLY BAD 
DESPITE THE MASSIVE 
SEARCH AS DARKENS CLOSES IN AGAIN 
DAVID AND HIS COMPANION FACE 
ANOTHER NIGHT OUTSIDE 
VISIBILITY WAS VERY BAD EVERYTHING 
WAS COVERED IN SNOW 
WHEN YOU GET 
TO THE END OF THE DAY AND YOU HAVE 
NOT FOUND THE PERSON YOU ARE 
LOOKING FOR IT'S WORRYING 
I THINK 
IN THIS CASE IN PARTICULAR I 
THOUGHT IF THESE GUYS ARE SO 
EXPERIENCE AND WE WANT HAVEN'T 
FOUND THEM THERE IS ALWAYS THE 
FEAR OF AVALANCHE IN THE BACK OF 
YOUR MIND 
AS A SECOND NIGHT APPROACHES WITH 
NO NEWS OF DAVID MAGGIE IS 
INCREASINGLY WORRIED 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO REALLY I 
WAS JUST REALLY LOST 
I WENT INTO A REAL DARK CORNER 
THOUGHT GOD WHAT IF THEY NEVER 
FIND THEM 
IT'S DAWN ON DAY THREE 
THE SKIES ARE FINALLY CLEAR 
THE HELICOPTER CAN JOIN THE SEARCH 
WE LOOKED AT OUR MAP TO SAY WHICH 
WAY TO GO WE HEARD THE HELICOPTER 
WE RAN OUT AND PUT OUR HANDS UP IN 
THE AIR 
DAVID AND HIS COMPANION ARE WINCHED 
TO SAFETY 
DELIGHT AND RELIEF I THINK A
