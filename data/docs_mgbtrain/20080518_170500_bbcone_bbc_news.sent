EVIDENCE OF THE TRUE EXTENT OF THE 
SUFFERING IN BURMA A BRITISH

BRITISH MEDICAL CHARITY MERLIN 
WHICH IS WORKING IN LAP PUTT AT

ONE OF THE WORST HIT AREAS 
MERLIN'S STAFF ARE KEEPING A VIDEO 
DIARY 
THE MONSOON HAS HIT THIS DIARY TOWN WITH A VENGEANCE NOW AND THE 
PEOPLE ARE ARE SUFFERING HERE MORE 
THAN EVER IN CONDITIONS LIKE THESE 
ACUTE DIARRHOEA AND PNEUMONIA COULD 
BECOME MAJOR KILLERS IN A FEW DAYS

THEIR NUMBER ONE LEADER THE SENIOR 
LEADER FROM GORDON BROWN 
INSISTING THAT THIS WAS A 
HUMANITARIAN ENTERPRISE AND THAT

TREATING THIS ON THE TERMS WE'RE 
OFFERING IT 
IN THE DELTA AID FROM 
BRITAIN GETS THROUGH TO THE MERLIN 
DOCTORS A CHILD CRIES OUT AS HIS 
INFECTED WOUND IS FINALLY TREATED 
THIS IS VERY COMMON WE SEE AFTER 
EMERGENCIES THAT WOUNDS ARE 
TREATED BUT THEY'RE NOT PROPERLY 
DISINFECTED OR STERILISED AND WHEN 
THAT HAPPENS IT'S ALMOST CERTAINTY 
THAT THE WOUND WILL BREAK DOWN AND 
NOT HEAL PROPERLY 
SLOWLY MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING 
OUTSIDE HELP HERE BUT ALL THIS 
SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED TWO WEEKS AGO 
AND EVERY EXTRA DAY IS COSTING 
LIVES LIVES WE CAN TALK TO ANDREW MARK 
MALLOCH BROWN IS PREDICTING THINGS 
ARE SHIFTING DRAMATICALLY NOW IS 
THERE ANY REAL EVIDENCE OF THAT 
NOT YET NO FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF 
WEEKS WE'VE SEEN THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
TRYING TO SHAME BURMA'S GENERALS 
INTO OPENING THEIR DOORS THAT 
HASN'T WORKED THE BRITISH 
AMERICANS THE FRENCH WARSHIPS 
SITTING OFF THE COAST WAITING WITH 
THEIR AID AND NOT BEING ALLOWED IN 
BUT WE'RE NOW SEEING SOME SIGNS 
THAT PERHAPS THINGS COULD CHANGE 
SLOWLY ON THE GROUND WITH A MORE 
DIPLOMATIC APPROACH THAT'S WHY 
WE'RE HEARING THAT THE UN 
SECRETARY GENERAL BAN KI MOON 
WILL BE VISITING RANGOON THIS WEEK 
TO TRY TO PUSH THINGS FORWARD WITH 
A MORE NUANCEED PERSUASIVE LINE FOR 
THE GENERALS FOR THE TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OUT IN THE DELTA TONIGHT 
IN THE RAIN OUT IN THE OPEN THRBGS 
IS ALL MUCH TOO LITTLE MUCH TOO 
LATE LATE CHINA HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THREE DAYS 
OF NATIONAL MOURNING FOR VICTIMS OF 
THE COUNTRY'S EARTHQUAKE WILL BEGIN 
TOMORROW NEARLY A WEEK AFTER THE 
QUAKE STRUCK RESCUE WORKERS ARE 
CONTINUING THEIR SEARCH BUT ARE 
FINDING FEW SURVIVORS MORE THAN 
THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ARE NOW KNOWN TO HAVE DIED 
AND MANY MORE HAVE BEEN LEFT 
HOMELESS OUR CORRESPONDENT JAMES 
RENOLD HAS SENT THIS REPORT WHICH 
YOU MAY FIND PARTS OF IT DISTURBING 
IF THERE'S ANYONE LEFT ALIVE UNDER 
THE RUINS IN THE TOWN OF BEICHUAN 
NO ONE CAN FIND THEM AFTER SIX 
DAYS YOU DON'T GET TOO MANY MORE 
MIRACLES 
HERE RESCUERS BREAK THROUGH THE 
RUBBLE OF A HOTEL 
THIS MAN IS HOPING TO FIND HIS THIRTY TWO 
YEAR OLD SON 
HE'S ASKED RESCUERS TO SEARCH 
BECAUSE HE'S CONVINCED HIS SON IS 
STILL ALIVE 
THE DAY BEFORE 
YESTERDAY WE CALLED MY SON'S 
MOBILE PHONE AND WE GOT THROUGH 
BUT WE COULD ONLY HEAR BREATHING 
VERY WEAK BREATHING 
THE WORKERS LOOK INSIDE BUT THEY 
DON'T FIND ANY SURVIVORS 
RESCUE WORKERS HAVE GIVEN UP HOPE 
HERE THEY'VE GOT TO MOVE ON TO 
OTHER PLACES 
BUT WHEN YOUR ONLY SON IS TRAPPED 
UNDERNEATH ALL THIS AND YOU 
BELIEVE THAT HE'S STILL ALIVE YOU 
CAN'T WALK AWAY 
HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE THAT THEY 
SHOULD GIVE UP LOOKING FOR ALL THAT 
THEY HAVE 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE 
DIED AND WE'RE NOW SLOWLY LEARNING 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO SOME OF THEM 
THESE PICTURES FILMED IN BEICHUAN 
ON FRIDAY SHOW A MAN TRAPPED UNDER 
A COLLAPSED BUILDING 
HE'S SERIOUSLY INJURED 
THE T. V. REPORTERS HANDS HIM A MOBILE 
PHONE SO HE CAN TALK TO HIS WIFE 
I DON'T HOLD OUT MUCH HOPE OF 
SURVIVING SURVIVING LATER ON RESCUERS MANAGE TO PULL 
HIM OUT 
BUT THEY'RE TOO LATE 
THEY CAN'T REVIVE HIM 
THESE PICTURES SHOW THAT THERE'S 
NOT MUCH HOPE IN OTHER PLACES 
EITHER EITHER THESE ARE THE FIRST SHOTS OF A 
REMOTE VILLAGE ENTIRELY DESTROYED 
BY THE EARTHQUAKE 
YOU CAN BARELY TELL THAT THIS 
VILLAGE EVER EXISTED 
THOSE WHO MADE IT OUT ALIVE DON'T 
KNOW WHAT TO DO 
IT'S EMERGED THAT THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST 
DEFENCE COMPANY B. A. E. SYSTEMS AND A 
SENIOR COLLEAGUE WERE DETAINED AND 
BRIEFLY QUESTIONED AT AN AMERICAN 
AIRPORT LAST WEEK U. S. AUTHORITIES 
ARE INVESTIGATING CORRUPTION 
ALLEGATIONS SURROUNDING A MAJOR 
ARMS DEAL WITH SAUDI ARABIA IN THE 
NINETEEN EIGHTIES NINETEEN EIGHTIES B. A. E. HAS DENIED ANY WRONG DOING OUR 
DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT REPORTS 
AN IMMENSELY EMBARRASSING ENCOUNTER 
FOR THE HEAD OF ONE OF BRITAIN'S 
BIGGEST COMPANIES THE DEFENCE 
EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER B. A. E. SYSTEMS 
ENTERING THE U. S. ON A BUSINESS TRIP 
VIA ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S BUSIEST 
AIRPORTS BAE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
MIKE TURNER AND A COMPANION WERE 
UNEXPECTEDLY PULLED OVER FOR THE 
NEXT TWENTY MINUTES THEY WERE HELD FOR 
QUESTIONING THEIR LAPTOPS SEARCHED 
AND A SUBPOENA SERVED BEFORE THEY 
WERE ALLOWED TO GO IT'S ALL PART 
OF THE U. S. JUSTICE'S DEPARTMENT'S 
INVESTIGATION INTO A MASSIVE B. A. E. 
ARMS DEAL SUPPLYING JETS AND OTHER 
EQUIPMENT TO SAUDI ARABIA AND 
WHETHER BRIBERY WAS INVOLVED IT'S 
AN ALLEGATION B. A. E. DENIES BUT IT'S 
ALREADY CAUSED A POLITICAL STORM 
HERE IN BRITAIN 
THE ORIGINAL ARMS DEAL SIGNED IN 
NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE BY THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT 
CEMENTED BRITAIN'S BIGGEST EVER 
EXPORT DEAL BUT FOUR YEARS AGO A 
PROBE WAS LAUNCHED BY THE SERIOUS 
FRAUD OFFICE SO INVESTIGATE 
ALLEGATIONS THAT SAUDI ARABIA'S 
PRINCE BANDAR HAD RECEIVED MILLIONS 
OF POUNDS IN KICKBACKS COMMON 
PRACTICE IN THE MIDDLE EAST BUT 
WHICH HE DENIES THEN IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
APPARENTLY AFTER A THREAT FROM THE 
SAUDIS THAT THEY MIGHT CEASE CO 
OPERATION ON INTELLIGENCE AND 
FUTURE ARMS SALES TONY BLAIR 
ORDERED AN ABRUPT HALT TO THE PROBE 
THAT HAS NOW BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE 
HIGH COURT WHICH EARLIER THIS YEAR 
RULED THAT THE SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE 
WAS WRONG TO HALT ITS INVESTIGATION 
BUT ACROSS THE ATLANTIC THE U. S. 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PARALLEL 
INVESTIGATION IS CLEARLY REACHING 
AN ACTIVE STAGE 
IT IS A NATIONAL 
DISGRACE THAT IN THIS COUNTRY A 
MAJOR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION WAS 
STOPPED FOLLOWING POLITICAL 
INTERFERENCE IN ORDER TO PROTECT 
COMMERCIAL INTERESTS WHEREAS IN THE 
UNITED STATES THE PROSECUTORS ARE 
BEING ALLOWED TO GET ON WITH THEIR 
JOB 
B. A. E. IS MAKING IT CLEAR IT IS JOB CO OPERATING WITH THE U. S. 
THE THE FOREIGN OFFICE INSISTS ANY 
DEALINGS BETWEEN THE U. S. JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT AND B. A. E. SYSTEMS CONCERNS 
THEM THEM THEM ALONE BUT THE 
AMERICANS HAVE ALSO APPROACHED THE 
HOME OFFICE APPARENTLY FORMALLY 
REQUESTING LEGAL ASSISTANCE SO 
CONTROVERSY OVER THE SAUDI ARMS 
DEAL ISN'T OVER YET 
GORDON BROWN HAS STRONGLY URGED M. P.'S 
TO BACK STEM CELL RESEARCH USING 
HUMAN ANIMAL EMBRYOS ON THE EVE OF 
A COMMONS VOTE TOMORROW IN A 
NEWSPAPER ARTICLE HE SAID THE WORK 
WAS INHERENTLY MORAL AND COULD LEAD 
TO CURES FOR DISEASES THAT COULD 
AFFECT MILLIONS 
M. P.'S GET A CHANCE TO SET ASIDE PARTY 
POLITICS AND THROUGH PERSONAL 
CONSCIENCE DECIDE ISSUES OF 
FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO SCIENCE

AND SO CALLED SAVIOUR SIBLINGS AND 
ON TUESDAY AND THE TIME LIMIT FOR 
ABORTION TOMORROW THE MAIN 
CONTROVERSY WILL CONCERN HYBRIDS 
BRITISH SCIENTISTS HAVE ALREADY 
CREATED THESE USING CATTLE EGGS 
BECAUSE HUMAN EGGS ARE IN SHORT 
SUPPLY THEY'RE NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE PER CENT HUMAN AND 
ZERO POINT ONE PER CENT ANIMAL THEY HOPE TO EXTRACT 
THE STEM CELLS INSIDE WHEN THEY'RE 
SMALLER THAN A PINHEAD IN ORDER TO 
STUDY A RANGE OF DISEASES IN HIS 
OBSERVER ARTICLE GORDON BROWN 
GIVES UNEQUIVOCAL SUPPORT HE SAYS 
BUT THOSE AGAINST HYBRID EMBRYOS 
WILL ARGUE THAT EMBRYONIC STEM CELL 
RESEARCH HAS SO FAR YIELDED NOTHING 
THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ROUTE BUT 
BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY ROUTE WHICH 
THROWS UP MORAL PROBLEMS ADULT 
STEM CELLS DON'T UMBILICAL CORD 
USE DOESN'T BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY 
ROUTE THAT THROWS UP MORAL PROBLEMS 
IT SEEMS TO ME THE ONUS IS ON 
SCIENCE TO SAY BUT LOOK WE CAN 
PROVE THAT THIS WORKS SO FAR IT 
HASN'T HASN'T TOMORROW MR. BROWN WILL ALSO VOTE 
IN SUPPORT OF THE CREATION OF 
SAVIOUR SIBLINGS ALLOWING A 
COUPLE TO CONCEIVE A CHILD WHO CAN 
DON'T UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD FOR A

TO VOTE TO KEEP THE ABORTION TIME 
LIMIT AT TWENTY FOUR WEEKS ON HYBRID 
EMBRYOS THE CLEAR ADVICE FROM 
NOBEL PRIZE WINNING SCIENTISTS AND 
BODIES LIKE CANCER RESEARCH U. K. AND 
THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE SOCIETY 
FEEL THIS RESEARCH IS VITAL M. P.'S

OVERRULE THE ADVICE OF BRITISH 
SCIENCE SCIENCE IT'S BEEN A WEEKEND THAT WILL LIVE

NEXT SEASON FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
THE CLUB'S HISTORY 
NINETEEN YEARS AFTER HIS LAST SCREEN 
OUTING INDIANA JONES IS BACK THIS 
TIME PITTING HIS WITS AGAINST COLD 
WAR SOVIET AGENTS IN THE JUNGLES OF 
PERU THE FILM IS BEING PREMIERED 
TONIGHT AT THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL 
AT THE WORLD'S FOREMOST ART HOUSE 
FILM FESTIVAL A MOVIE THAT'S GOT 
BLOCKBUSTER WRITTEN ALL OVER IT HAS 
BEEN THE BIGGEST TALKING POINT 
INDIANA JONES IS BACK AND IN A 
KNOWING ASIDE IN THE FILM ITSELF 
THERE'S AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF HOW 
MUCH TIME HAS PASSED 
THIS AIN'T 
GOING TO BE EASY 
NOT AS EASY AS IT 
USED TO BE 
HARRISON FORD IS SIXTY FIVE 
YEARS OLD MANY ARE CREDIBLE HE CAN 
BE FOR A YOUNG AUDIENCE IS IT 
RELEVANT AS AN ISSUE 
IT'S NOT 
RELEVANT TO ME L. DO WHAT'S 
REQUIRED IN A CHARACTER 
AND IN 
TERMS OF THE PLOT MUCH HAS BEEN 
KEPT SECRET BUT HARRISON FORD 
ALBEIT CAREFULLY REVEALED JUST A 
LITTLE LITTLE SO I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT WE MADE 
THE DECISION TO MOVE FORWARD IN 
TIME AND TO REVISIT THE LATER 
PERIOD IN HISTORY WHICH IS THE 
PERIOD OF THE COLD WAR NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN AND 
THE ERA OF MCCARTHYISM IN THE 
UNITED STATES A PERIOD OF TIME IN 
OUR HISTORY WHICH I THINK IS 
SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF 
AND HAS SOME RESONANCE IN THE 
PRESENT PRESENT THIS IS SLICK FORMULA FILM MAKING 
AND WHILE THE STORY IS ALWAYS A 
QUEST THE FRANCHISE CAN PREDICT 
THE ANSWER A BOOMING BOX OFFICE 
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE HAVE 
ALREADY WATCHED THE TRAIRL OF THIS 
FILM ON THE INTERNET THERE'S NO 
DOUBT THAT THE LATEST INDIANA 
ADVENTURE WILL BE A BIG COMMERCIAL 
SUCCESS THE BIGGER ISSUE IS ALSO 
WHETHER IT WILL BE A CRITICAL 
SUCCESS AND MUCH OF THAT DEPENDS ON 
THE CREDIBILITY OF HARRISON FORD AS 
AN ACTION HERO 
THAT'S IT FOR NOW I'LL BE BACK 
WITH MORE FROM THE NEWS ROOM AT TEN 
O'CLOCK ON B. B. C. ONE GOOD EVENING FROM B. B. C. LONDON
