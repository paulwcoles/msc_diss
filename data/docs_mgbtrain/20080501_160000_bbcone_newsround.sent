ONLINE ONLINE TO A JUMBO SIZED PROBLEM IN SOUTH 
AFRICA FOR THE PAST THIRTEEN YEARS IT 
HAS BEEN ILLEGAL TO KILL ELEPHANTS 
BUT NOW THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THERE 
ARE TOO MANY OF THEM AND MADE IT 
LEGAL TO PUT THEM DOWN 
THIS IS KRUGER NATIONAL PARK IN 
SOUTH AFRICA EVERY YEAR THOUSANDS 
OF VISITOR FLOCK HERE TO SEE THE 
ELEPHANTS AND THEY HAVE A GOOD 
CHANCE OF SPOTTING ONE 
BUT THAT'S WHAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN 
GOVERNMENT SAYS IS THE PROBLEM 
THEY RECKON RECKON THERE ARE TOO 
MANY ELEPHANTS ROAMING THE BUSH 
IN THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS THE NUMBER OF 
ELEPHANTS IN SOUTH AFRICA HAS GROWN 
FROM EIGHT THOUSAND TO EIGHTEEN THOUSAND 
THE ANIMALS ARE BLAMED FOR DAMAGING 
THE COUNTRYSIDE EATING FOOD NEEDED 
FOR HUMANS AND CREATING PROBLEMS 
FOR OTHER ANIMALS LIVING NEARBY 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE ANIMALS 
NEED TO BE CONTROLLED SO THE LAW 
HAS BEEN CHANGE TODAY KEEP THE 
NUMBER OF ELEPHANTS DOWN IT IS 
LEGAL TO KILL THEM 
BUT CAMPAIGNERS ARE GOING TO COURT 
TO TRY AND GET THE LAW SCRAPPED 
THEY SAY KILLING THE ELEPHANTS 
ISN'T THE RIGHT SOLUTION 
THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO THINK 
OF MORE HUMANE WAYS OF CONTROLLING 
NUMBERS BUT IMPROVING ENCLOSURES 
MOVING THEM TO DIFFERENT AREAS AND 
GIVING THEM MEDICINE TO STOP THEM 
FROM HAVING BABIES
