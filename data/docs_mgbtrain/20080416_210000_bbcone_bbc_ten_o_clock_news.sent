UNPRECEDENTED INTERVENTION TO EASE 
THE CREDIT CRISIS HIGH STREET 
BANKS WILL BE OFFERED GOVERNMENT 
BONDS MAKING IT EASIER TO BORROW 
AND TO LEND 
GORDON BROWN HOLDING TALKS IN NEW 
YORK TODAY SAID HE WAS READY TO ACT 
WE ARE LOOK AT HOW WE CAN GENERALLY 
INJECT LIQUIDITY INTO THE MARKET 
AND HOW MONEY CAN GET THROUGH TO 
FIRST TIME BUYERS PARTICULARLY 
THOSE GROUPS OF PEOPLE DENIED 
MORTGAGES AT THE MOMENT 
AS THE 
CREDIT CRISIS CONTINUES THE 
CHANCELLOR ADMITS THE GOVERNMENT 
NEEDS TO SHARPEEN ITS ACT THE RHYS 
JONES MURDER INVESTIGATION TONIGHT 
THERE HAS BEEN A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT 
A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD YOUTH HAS BEEN 
CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF RHYS 
JONES ON TWENTY SECOND AUGUST TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
THE ROBERT MUGABE IS ACCUSED BY 
BRITAIN OF TRYING TO STEAL THE 
PRESIDENTAL ELECTION ANOTHER DAY 
OF HEAVY VIOLENCE IN GAZA AT LEAST 
TWENTY TWO HAVE DIED IN THE LATEST CLASHES 
BENEDICT BECOMES JUST THE SECOND 
POPE IN HISTORY TO VISIT THE UNITED 
STATES 
ON B. B. C. LONDON NEWS THE GOVERNMENT 
PLEDGES MORE POLICE OFFICERS TO 
COUNTER EXTREMISM IN THE CAPITAL 
HAS KEN LIVINGSTONE MISSED THE BUS 
ON HIS PLEDGE FOR GREENER PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT 
GOOD EVENING THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
IS TO TAKE UNPRESS DENTSED ACTION 
TO EASE THE PRESSURE IN THE 
FINANCIAL SYSTEM THE B. B. C. HAS BEEN 
TOLD THAT THE PLAN IS TO ALLOW THE 
HIGH STREET BANKS TO SWAP THEIR 
MORTGAGE BASED ASSETS FOR 
GOVERNMENT BONDS THERE ARE 
CONCERNS THAT THE TAXPAYER WILL BE 
EVEN MORE EXPOSED WHEN THE SYSTEM 
IS PUT IN PLACE DURING THE DAY THE 
CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING 
ADMITTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDED 
TO SHARPEN UP AND TO IMPROVE ITS 
MESSAGE MESSAGE NOT SO LONG AGO THE FAST PACED 
WORLD OF MONEY WAS A WELL OILED 
MACHINE BILLIONS OF POUNDS CHANGED 
HANDS IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE NOT 
ANY MORE THANKS TO THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH BANKS DON'T WANT TO LEND TO 
EACH OTHER WHICH MEANS THEY DON'T 
WANT TO LEND TO AWFUL US GORDON 
BROWN WENT TO THE EPICENTRE OF THIS 
GLOBAL FINANCIAL SHOP TODAY NEW 
YORK IT IS THE COLLAPSING VALUE OF 
AMERICAN SUB PRIME MORTGAGES THAT 
STARTED BRITISH BANKS WORRY BEING 
MORTGAGES HERE 
ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO U. S. 
BANKERS TODAY OFFICIALS WERE MOVING 
TOWARDS AMERICAN STYLE SOLUTIONS 
HERE AT HOME 
WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING WITH THE 
BANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES 
THROUGH THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND 
THROUGH THE TREASURY IS WHAT 
MEASURES WE CAN TAKE TO BOTH INJECT 
LIQUIDITY INTO THE MARKET PLACE ON 
A MORE SUSTAINED BASIS 
I'VE LEARNT 
THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS CLOSE 
TO LAUNCHING AN ENTIRELY NEW 
PROGRAMME FOR BRITISH BANKS BACKED 
BY THE TREASURY TO HELP MONEY FLOW 
MORE FREELY IN THE MONEY MARKETS 
THEY ARE WORKING OUT THE FINAL 
DETAILS THE BROAD OUTLINES OF THE 
SCHEME WILL BE SIMILAR TO RECENT 
MOVES BY THE AMERICAN CENTRAL BANK 
AND IT COULD BE LAUNCHED AS EARLY 
AS NEXT WEEK 
AND IT COULD BE LAUNCHED AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK 
AS NEXT WEEK IN NORMAL TIMES BANKS LEND HAPPILY 
BACK AND FORTH TO EACH OTHER SECURE 
IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE BANKS 
HAVE MORTGAGES AND OTHER ASSETS TO 
BACK THOSE LOANS NOW THEY ARE SO 
NERVOUS ABOUT HOW MUCH THOSE 
MORTGAGES ARE WORTH THEY L. L. ONLY 
LEND TO EACH OTHER AT VERY HIGH 
RATES OR NOT AT ALL THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND'S PLAN IS TO BREAK THE 
LOGJAM BY TAKING THOSE MORTGAGE 
ASSETS OFF THE BANK'S HANDS FOR A 
YEAR OR SO IN EXCHANGE FOR 
GOVERNMENT BONDS IT HOPES THE 
BANKS WILL BE HAPPIER TO LEND TO 
EACH OTHER AGAIN AND THEN HAPPIER 
TO LEND TO ALL OF US 
EACH OTHER AGAIN AND THEN HAPPIER TO LEND TO ALL OF US 
YOU MIGHT SAY 
ISN'T THIS A BIT LIKE NORTHERN 
ROCK THE GOVERNMENT WOULD SAY 
ABSOLUTELY NOT 
I'M TOLD THEY WON'T GO THROUGH WITH 
THE PLAN IF THEY HAVEN'T WORKED OUT 
A WAY FOR TAXPAYERS TO BE PROTECTED 
THE CHANCELLOR WAS IN CHINA TODAY 
HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS 
PLAN BUT HE DID ADMIT THE 
GOVERNMENT NEEDED TO HAVE A CLEARER 
MESSAGE FOR VOTERS ON THE QUESTION 
OF TAXPAYER RISK IT WILL HAVE TO BE 
VERY CLEAR INDEED 
THERE HAS TO BE 
MORE LA QUIDTY THIS APPROACH OF A 
SWAP COULD BE PART OF THAT WHAT 
THE GOVERNMENT THE AUTHORITIES THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND HAVE TO MAKE 
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR IS THAT THIS IS 
NOT A BAILOUT THIS IS NOT THE 
TAXPAYERS TAKING ON THE RISBLGS AND 
LOSSES OF THE BANK 
THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND HAS ACCEPTED MORTGAGE 
BACKED ASSETS AS SECURITY BEFORE 
BUT ONLY ON SHORTER TERM LOANS THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE BACKED THIS IDEA 
OF SWAPPING THOSE ASSETS FOR BONDS 
FOR LONGER PERIODS 
THEY SAID TODAY THAT IT COULD OFFER 
SIGNIFICANT HELP TO HOME OWNERS WHO 
HAVE HAD TO REMORTGAGE AT HIGHER 
RATES BANK SHARES WENT UP TODAY ON 
THE HOPE THAT NEW OFFICIAL HELP WAS 
IN STORE THE GOVERNMENT WON'T 
REJOICE IN THE BANK SHAREHOLDERS 
WINNING OUT BUT IT WILL BE WORTH 
IT IF THIS PLAN HELPS TO STOP THE 
CRUNCH SPREADING TO ALL OF US 
IN HIS ADDRESS TO THE UNITED 
NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL TODAY 
GORDON BROWN ACCUSED ROBERT MUGABE 
OF TRYING TO STEAL THE 
PRESIDENTAL ELECTION IN ZIMBABWE 
HE SAID THAT NO ONE BELIEVED THAT 
MR. MUGABE HAD WON HE CALLED ON THE 
UN TO SEND OUT A STRONG MESSAGE 
OUR POLITICAL EDITOR NICK ROBINSON 
REPORTS NOW FROM NEW YORK 
IT HAS TAKE AN TRIP TO NEW YORK 
MORE THAN TWO WEEKS SINCE THE 
PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE VOTED FOR GORDON 
BROWN TO FINALLY SAY IT ROBERT 
MUGABE IS TRYING TO STEAL AN 
ELECTION ELECTION TIME TO ACT SAID THE BANNIER 
FLOWN ABOVE THE UNITED NATIONS 
TODAY AS THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
GATHERED TO DISCUSS AFRICA 
BAZARPLY SOME WANTED ZIMBABWE KEPT 
OFF THE AGENDA 
NOT SO GORDON BROWN 
NO ONE THINKS HAVING SEEN THE 
RESULTS AT POLLING STATIONS THAT 
PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS WON THIS 
ELECTION ELECTION A STOLEN ELECTION WOULD NOT A. B. 
DEMOCRATIC ELECTION AT ALL 
AS A GENERAL SECRETARY HAS SAID 
THE CREDABILITY OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PROCESS DEPENDS ON THERE BEING A 
LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT 
UNTIL NOW 
BRITAIN HAS BACKED SOUTH AFRICAN 
PRESIDENT MBEKI'S QUIET DIPLOMACY 
SO QUIET HE DIDN'T EVEN MENTION 
ZIMBABWE TODAY AND INSISTS THAT 
THERE IS NO CRISIS THERE 
ZIMBABWE'S MAN AT THE UN IS 
DECIDEDLY UNROUGHED BY WHAT HE 
DISMISSES AS AN ATTACK BY HIS 
COUNTRY'S FORMER COLONIAL 
OPPRESSERS 
WE HAVE NEVER STOLEN OPPRESSERS ELECTIONS THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE 
SHOULD STEAL ELECTIONS 
THERE IS IF 
YOU ARE LOSING UNLESS YOU STEAL 
THEM 
NO WHEN WE FOUND THAT THERE THEM WAS DISCREPANCIES THERE WAS 
CHEATING THAT HAD OCCURED WE HAD TO 
MAKE SURE ACCORD TOGETHER ZIMBABWE 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION THEY HAD TO BE 
SURE WHAT THEY WERE PUBLISHING 
WERE CORRECT RESULTS 
WITH THOSE RESULTS STILL NOT 
PUBLISHED GORDON BROWN HOPES THAT 
TODAY MARKED MOMENT WHEN THE UN 
WOULD BEGIN TO TAKE GREATER ROLE 
IN CONFRONTING ROBERT MUGABE WHAT WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN ROUND THE TABLE THIS 
MORNING IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COUNTRIES 
FROM AFRICA COUNTRIES FROM ASIA 
AND OF COURSE FROM EUROPE SAYING 
THAT THE RESULTS HAVE TO BE 
PUBLISHED THIS THAT THEY HAVE TO 
BE TRANSPARENT EVERYTHING HAS TO 
BE ABOVE BOARD 
THE PRIME MINISTER 
NOW HOPES THAT THE UNITED NATIONS 
WILL PLAY A MUCH BIGGER ROLE IN 
CONFRONTING MUGABE 
IT IS NOT HIS WORDS OR VISIT THAT 
IS MAKING NEWS HERE 
THIS MORNING 
POPE BENEDICT ARRIVES ON U. S. SOIL

HARD TO GET ANY ATTENTION HERE 
I LOVE AMERICA L. LOVE WATCHING

DID YOU MAKE OF THE STRONGLY WORDED 
STATEMENT FROM MR. BROWN TODAY WELL WELL IT WAS SURPRISING BECAUSE IT WAS 
HERE AND IT WAS NOW WHY DID GORDON 
BROWN DO SOMETHING WHICH HE KNOW 
THAT IS ROBERT MUGABE RELISHS IN 
OTHER WORDS BEING ATTACKED BY A 
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER WHICH HAS 
TENDED TO RALLY PEOPLE TO MUGABE 
BOTH IN ZIMBABWE AND IN AFRICA AS A 
WHOLE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE PRIME 
MINISTER BELIEVES THAT THE TIME 
AND IN THIS PLACE THIS CAN'T BE 
REPRESENTED SIMPLY AS BRITAIN 
VERSES ZIMBABWE THE UN SECRETARY 
GENERAL AGREED WITH MR. BROWN TODAY 
VOICES IN SOUTH AFRICA ARE 
INCREASINGLY CRITICAL OF THEIR 
PRESIDENT OF GOING TOO SOFLTLY 
SOFTLY THE HOPE IS PRESSURE MOUNTS 
ON MUGABE NOBODY PREDICTS THAT 
PRESSURE WILL MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
IT IS AN IMPORTANT VISIT FOR MR. 
BROWN WHAT DID HE MAKE OF THE FACT 
THAT THE CHANCELLOR IS SAYING THE 
GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO SHARPEN UP 
IT'S ACT 
IN ITSELF SAYING THE 
GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO SHARPEN UP ITS 
ACT COULD BE REPORTED AS A 
STATEMENT OF THE BLEEDING OBVIOUS 
WHAT MAKE IT IS SURPRISING IS WHO 
SAID IT IT IS THE CHANCELLOR WHO 
SAID IT SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A 
LONG TERM ALLY OF GORDON BROWN WHO 
FOUGHT TO GET HIM THE TOP JOB TO 
GET HIM INTO TEN DOWNING STREET NOW 
CLEARLY THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY 
DIFFICULT TIME FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
GORDON BROWN IS FACING ECONOMIC 
PRESSURES POLITICAL PRESSURES THAT 
FRANKLY TONY BLAIR NEVER EVER FACED 
WE ARE SEEING THAT MINISTERS 
GOVERNMENT THAT THE LABOUR PARTY 
ITSELF ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW THE 
WEAR AND TEAR

THE PAST THREE MONTHS ALONE IT HAS 
PROMPTED PROMPTED NEW FEARS ON 
THE IMPACT OF THE POOR AND PUBLIC 
BACK LASH IF THE PRICES KEEP RISING 
DRAMATICALLY TONIGHT YOU CAN HAVE 
DINNER AT THIS RESTAURANT IN 
BEIJING FOR ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE OH A HEAD 
THAT IS TEN PER CENT MORE THAN IT WAS A YEAR 
AGO THE RESTAURANT DOESN'T DARE TO 
PUT UP ITS PRICES ANY FURTHER 
PEOPLE HERE ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING 
TO AFFORD EVERYTHING ELSE 
RICE COOKING OIL MEAT AND VEGETABLE PRICES HAVE ALL 
GONE UP MY PARENTS ARE RETIRED 
THEY HAVE HAD TO DOUBLE THE AMOUNT 
THEY SPEND IN ORDER TO BUY THE SAME 
AMOUNT OF FOOD 
THAT IS WHAT REALLY HURTS PEOPLE 
HERE HERE IN RECENT YEARS CHINA HAS GOT 
RICHER BUT THE THINGS ITS PEOPLE 
WANT TO EAT KEEP ON GETTING MORE 
AND MORE EXPENSIVE 
IN CHINA PORK IS A GREAT FAVOURITE 
BUT LAST YEAR THERE WAS AN OUTBREAK 
OF BLUE EAR DISEASE IN THIS COUNTRY 
SO PORK PRICES IN SOME BUTCHER 
SHOPS HAVE DOUBLED FROM EIGHTY P. TO ONE 
OF SEVENTY A KILO 
CHINA HASN'T FACED THE KINDS OF 
PROBLEMS OTHER DEVELOPING NATIONS 
HAVE HAD IN COUNTRIES DEPENDANT ON 
FOOD IMPORTS HUGE PRICE RISES HAVE 
CAUSED UNREST CHINA TRIES TO MAKE 
AS MUCH OF ITS OWN FOOD AS IT CAN 
IT DOESN'T YET TO HAVE IMPORT HUGE 
AMOUNTS OF FOODS PRODUCTION LEVELS 
ARE THERE IN THE COUNTRY THE 
POPULATION ISN'T BEING EXPOSED IN A 
WAY THAT YOU SEE PERHAPS IN OTHER 
ASIAN COUNTRIES LIKE BANGLADESH OR 
AFGHANISTAN OR MANY COUNTRIES IN 
AFRICA WHERE THE POORER MEMBERS OF 
SOCIETY ARE REALLY AT THE SHARP END 
OF THESE PRICE INCREASES 
STILL CHINA HAS TO FEED THE 
WORLD'S BIGGEST POPULATION 
THE GOVERNMENT HERE DOESN'T WANT 
PRICES TO RISE ANY FURTHER PRICE 
RISES MAKE THE COMMUNIST PARTY 
NERVOUS RECENT HISTORY SHOWS THIS 
IF PEOPLE HERE CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY 
FOOD THEY GET ANGRY AND THEY 
PROTEST PROTEST THE GOVERNMENT WON'T WITH A THAT 
ESPECIALLY NOT THIS YEAR THE YEAR 
OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS COULD DO MORE 
HARM THAN GOOD FOR SOME PEOPLE 
EVEN LEAD TO A PREMATURE DEATH

CORRESPONDENT IS HERE WITH ME 
THIS THIS RESEVEN WAS PUBLISHED BY 
A HIGHLY RESPECTED INTERNATIONAL 
BODY AND ANALYSED SIXTY SEVEN CLINICAL 
TRIALS INTO VITAMIN AND ANTIOXIDANT 
SUP PLIMENTS MANY BRITONS ARE 
CONVINCED OF THEIR BENEFITS SALES 
ARE WORTH THREE HUNDRED SIX MILLION A YEAR AND 
THEY'RE TAKEN BY FOUR IN TEN ADULTS 
BUT THE FINDINGS WERE WORRYING 
VITAMIN A SUP PLIMENTS WERE 
ASSOCIATED WITH A SIXTEEN PER CENT INCREASED 
MORTALITY RISK 
BEETTA CAR TEEN WAS LINK TODAY A SEVEN PER CENT 
INCREASE AND VIT MEN E. TO A FOUR PER CENT 
INCREASE FOR BOTH VITAMIN AND C. 
AND SELENIUM THERE WAS NO RESULTS 
HOW ARE ANTIOXIDANT SUP PLIMENTS 
SUPPOSED TO HELP FREE RADICALS ARE 
MOLECULES THAT CAN SLOWLY DAMAGE 
TISSUE OVER TIME CAUSING AGEING AND 
DISEASE MANY BELIEVE THE 
ANTIOXIDANTS IN THE SUP PLIMENTS 
CAN MOP UP OR NEUTRALISE THE FREE 
RADICALS PROMOTING GOOD HEALTH 
BUT THIS COULD HAVE DAMAGING 
EFFECTS IN LARGE DOSES 
YOU MIGHT BE TAKING FISH OILS AND 
CALCIUM THAT'S A REASONABLE 
COMBINATION BUT IF YOU'RE TAKING 
EXTRA ANTIOXIDANTS YOU MAY BE 
DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE OVERWEIGHT 
DRINKER AND KIDNEY OR LIVER 
PROBLEMS THESE INCREASE THE RISK 
THE MILLIONS WHO TAKE A SINGLE 
MULTIVITAMIN PILL EVERY DAY 
SHOULDN'T BE ALARMED THIS RESEARCH 
LOOKED AT HIGH STRENGTH HIGH DOSE 
SUP PLIMENTS AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE 
WORRIED SOME PEOPLE 
I'VE HAD 
PATIENTS COMING IN ALL DAY SOME 
HAVE CAME IN WITH ALL THE VITAMINS 
THEY HAVE AT HOME AND ASKING CAN 
THEY TAKE THIS IT SHOWED MIGHT MAY 
BE TAKING SUP PLIMENTS MORE THAN 
THEY SHOULD WE'RE SAYING COME AND 
SEE YOUR PHARMACIST WE WILL 
REASSURE YOU ON THE RIGHT ONES THE THE BEST WAY TO STAY HEALTHY IS WITH A 
BALANCED DIET AND EXERCISE BUT ONE 
IN FOUR ADULTS MANAGE FIVE FRUIT

RESEARCH FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT 
SUPPLEMENTS PREVENT DISEASE BUT 
RATHER MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF
