YOU ASKED ME SHOW ME THE WAY TO 
ARARILLO THESE PICTURES HAVE 
HAUNTED ME WOULD YOU LIKE TO SWING 
ON A ROPE 
SO MUCH OF THE 
GOVERNMENT COMES FROM NUMBER TEN 
THESE DAYS THESE MINISTERS HAVE 
LOTS OF TIME TO PLAY IN THE PARK 
WHAT ABOUT YOU AS FIFTY FIVE PER CENT OF LABOUR 
VOTERS NOW WANT THE GREAT LEADER TO 
GO LABOUR VOTERS 
I WOULDN'T PAY 
TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO POLLS IN THE 
IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF A DIFFICULT 
ELECTION THAT'S THE FIRST RULE OF 
POLITICS REALLY IT HAS BEEN A 
DIFFICULT FEW DAYS FOR US I WOULD 
TAKE WITH A LARGE PINCH OF SALT ANY 
OPINION POLL IN THE LAST FEW DAYS 
THE GREAT LEADER EVER TIME HE POPS 
UP SAYS HE IS GOING TO LISTEN AND 
LEAD HERE IS AN OPINION POLL A 
GOOD SURVEY OF BRITISH PEOPLE 
SAYING FIFTY FIVE PER CENT OF HIS OWN VOTERS WANT 
HIM TO GO NOW YOU ARE SAYING I 
WOULDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THAT L. 
THOUGHT YOU WERE GOOD AT LISTENING 
WE WILL TAKE A LONGER VIEW IF YOU 
DON'T MIND WE NEED TO LISTEN TO 
WHAT THE PUBLIC TOLD US LAST 
THURSDAY AND LET'S BE HONEST THE 
PUBLIC DID GIVE US A PRETTY CLEAR 
MESSAGE LAST THURSDAY LET'S TALK 
ABOUT A REAL POLL RATHER THAN AN 
OPINION POLL 
THIS OPINION POLL 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT ELECTIONS AND 
THE BRITISH POLITICAL SYSTEM IS 
PEOPLE MIKE ME AND OTHER LIKE ME 
AND OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THE CABINET 
WERE OUT LAST WEEK WE HAD DIRECT 
CONTACT WITH PEOPLE AND THE RIGHT 
THING TO DO IS LISTEN TO WHAT THEY 
WERE SAYING THEN AND RESPOND IN THE 
RIGHT WAY 
THIS POLL ALSO SHOWS 
WAS THIS CONFIRMED AT THE DOORSTEP 
THAT MOST VOTERS NOT JUST LABOUR 
MOST VOTERS WANT SIGNIFICANT POLICY 
CHANGES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN 
THINGS LIKE HEALTH EDUCATION AND 
TAX ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO 
THAT 
WE DO HAVE TO LISTEN WE HAVE THAT SAID THAT SINCE LAST THURSDAY THE 
ISSUES THAT 
WILL WE GET 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES 
ISSUES NOT 
JUST A CASE OF LISTENING PEOPLE 
WILL SAY WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED I 
TELL YOU WHAT I LEARNED HAVING BEEN 
OUT ON THE DOORSTEPS IMMIGRATION 
IS A KEY ISSUE THAT WORRIES PEOPLE 
STILL CRIME REMAINS A CONCERN 
THERE IS A GENERAL CONCERN ABOUT 
FAIRNESS AND ARE WE DOING THE RIGHT 
THING BY PEOPLE WHO ARE PERHAPS 
ABOVE THE LINE FOR SOME OF THE 
SUPPORT THAT'S AVAILABLE AND MIDDLE 
INCOME EARNERS AND THIS IDEA OF THE 
SQUEEZED MIDDLE IS SOMETHING WE 
HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO IF IF IMMIGRATION IS SUCH A BIG ISSUE 
WILL YOU IGNORE CHARLES CLARKE'S 
ADVICE THIS MORNING TO STOP ALL 
THESE DOCK WHISTLES LIKE A TOTALLY 
MEANINGLESS MANTRA OF BRITISH JOBS 
FOR BRITISH WORKERS A POLICY WHICH 
IF YOU IMPLEMENTED WOULD BE 
ILLEGAL 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS ILLEGAL REFERRING TO 
HE IS REFERRING TO 
THINGS LIKE THAT BRITISH JOBS FOR 
BRITISH WORKERS SAYS ONE THING TO 
ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE AND IS ANTI 
IMMIGRATION WITH ANOTHER 
ON THIS 
ISSUE TALK ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE 
THE SUBSTANCE IS THE GOVERNMENT IS 
PROPOSING A POINTS BASED SYSTEM FOR 
IMMIGRATION THE PUBLIC WOULD SAY 
WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT AND CRUDELY 
IT'S DEPENDING ON WHAT SKILLS WHAT 
YOU CAN OFFER THIS COUNTRY IT THEN 
GIVES YOUED RIGHT TO COME IN WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT MINISTER WE HAVE 
DONE IT MANY TIMES ON THIS SHOW 
IT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THE THE FIRST TIME WE DID IT WAS WHEN HIS 
PARTY INTRODUCED IT AND YOU OPPOSED 
IT THAT'S ANOTHER MATTER CAN HE 
BE SURE WE WILL GET NO MORE OF THIS 
BRITISH JOBS FOR BRITISH WORKERS 
STUFF 
I MEAN I THINK IT'S A STUFF COMPLETELY LAWEDIBLE THING TO SAY 
WE WANT 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN HIGH HIGH QUALITY EMPLOYMENT IN ALL PARTS OF 
THE COUNTRY AND THAT WE ENSURE THAT 
IN PLACES LIKE THE ONE I REPRESENT 
WHICH HAS BEEN THROUGH DIFFICULT 
TIMES WITH THE LOSS OF 
MANUFACTURING JOBS RECENTLY THAT 
WE GET JOBS INTO THOSE 
YOU CAN'T 
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANY OTHER NON 
BRITISH WORKER AND IT WOULD BE 
ILLEGAL TO DO SO AGAINST EUROPEAN 
WORKERS YOU ACCEPT THAT 
THE POINT 
I WAS DESCRIBING PWR ABOUT THE 
POINTS BASED SYSTEM IS PRECISELY 
THAT THAT ACTUALLY IN MOST TESTS 
IF THERE IS A RESIDENT LISTEN 
THIS IS IMPORTANT IF THERE IS 
IT WILL NOT APPLY TO EUROPEAN 
WORKER 
THE WAY IN WHICH WORK WORKER PERMITS HAVE WORKED IS A RESIDENT 
LABOUR MARKET TEST IF THERE IS A 
SKILLED AND RESIDENT LABOUR MARKET 
THAT PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO 
THOSE WORKERS THAT'S THE WAY THE 
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM HAS 
TRADITIONALLY WORKED 
JUST BE CLEAR 
HERE YOU CANNOT GIVE A POINTS 
BASED SYSTEM OR PRIORITY TO BRITISH 
WORKERS OVER EUROPEAN WORKERS THAT 
WOULD BE ILLEGAL CORRECT 
OF COURSE 
THE POINTS BASED SYSTEM DOES NOT 
APPLY TO POLES CZECHES ESTONIANS 
AND SO ON 
THAT'S CORRECT THERE 
ARE TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS IN 
PLACE FROM THE FORMER EASTERN 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES YOU ARE RIGHT 
THE POINTS BASED SYSTEM APPLIES TO 
PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE EUROPE WHAT IT 
DOES DO IT ENABLES PEOPLE WHO ARE 
COMING IN WITH SKILLS IN SHORTAGE 
AREAS TO GET MORE POINTS AND THAT'S 
A SENSIBLE THING 
ARE YOU GOING TO 
WIN THE CREWE BY ELECTION ARE YOU 
ON A ROLL AT THE MOMENT 
WE ARE 
GOING TO FIGHT VERY HARD LET'S BE 
CLEAR 
ARE YOU GOING TO WIN 
IT'S A CLEAR SEAT WITH A STRONG LABOUR MAJORITY 
IT'S A STRONG SEAT YOU HAVE 
GWYNETH DUNWOODY WAS A GREAT 
INSTITUTION SHE WILL BE MISSED 
HER DAUGHTER IS FIGHTING THE SEAT 
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT CLEARLY WE 
ARE GOING TO FIGHT TO WIN YOU YOU THINK YOU CAN WIN THAT'S WHY DAVID 
CAMERON WAS UP THERE HE WOULDN'T 
HAVE GONE YESTERDAY IF HE DIDN'T 
THINK HE WAS GOING TO WIN DAVID DAVID CAMERON HAS BEEN TO ALL THE BY 
ELECTIONS WE HAVE HAD SINCE LEADER 
AND WILL CONTINUE TO GO TO THEM IN 
THE FUTURE HE WILL HAVE 
CONSERVATIVE M. P.'S MEMBERS OF THE 
SHADOW CABINET UP THERE CAMPAIGNING 
WE WILL DO OUR BEST YOU FIGHT 
EVERY BATTLE EVERY BY ELECTION 
WITH THE AIM OF WINNING 
YOU ARE 
NOT GOING TO TELL ME 
LET'S NOT GET 
OVERCONFIDENT I AM NOT GOING TO 
FORECAST VICTORY WE WILL DO OUR 
BEST 
O. K. QUIET START TO THE SHOW BEST STKPWHRP START AS WE MEAN TO GO ON 
NOW THE TEN P. TAX ROW RUM PWEPLS 
RUMBLES ON LABOUR BACKBENCHERS ARE 
CONTINUING TO PUSH GORDON BROWN AND 
THE CHANCELLOR TO EXPLAIN HOW 
THEY'LL COMPENSATE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
LOST OUT AND DAVID CAMERON HAS 
ALSO BEEN PILING ON THE PRESSURE 
BUT COULD THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER'S 
DECISION TO CAMPAIGN ON THE ISSUE 
BACKFIRE WHILE HE WAS ON THE 
STREETS OF CREWE AND NANTWICH 
YESTERDAY FOR SOME OF THE BY 
ELECTION PAVEMENT 
WE HAVE 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT HE WAS 
CHALLENGED BY A MEMBER OF THE 
PUBLIC TO SAY WHETHER HE WOULD 
REINSTATE THE TEN P. TAX BAND IF HE 
BECOMES PRIME MINISTER 
WOULD YOU 
PLACE THE TEN PER CENT TAX BACK WILL YOU 
REDUCE THE TWENTY PER CENT BACK TO TEN PER CENT FOR THE 
PEOPLE AFFECTED BY IT THAT'S ONE 
QUESTION 
I CAN'T PROMISE THAT BUT QUESTION WHAT WE CAN DO IS STOP THE 
GOVERNMENT IN THEIR TRACKS MAKE 
MAKE THEM REOPEN THE BUDGET AND 
HELP THE FIFTY THREE MILLION PEOPLE THEY'VE 
HIT THEY CAN DO THAT NOW 
WE DON'T 
WANT TAX CREDIT SIR 
I AGREE WITH 
YOU YOU CANNOT DO IT BY TAX 
CREDITS ALONE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT 
THE TAX ALLOWANCES PEOPLE'S TAX 
CODES CONSIDER DIRECT PAYMENTS TO 
PEOPLE GOT TO DO ALL THE THINGS 
NECESSARY TO THOSE PEOPLE 
I FIND MR. CAMERON'S RESPONSE 
BAFFLING GIVEN THAT IT'S HE 
HIMSELF WHO IS SAYING THIS IS 
ATOTEMIC ISSUE FOR THE BY ELECTION 
BACK AT THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN RED BOOK AND 
APPOLISHING THE RATE COSTS PRPBD SEVEN 
BILLION YEAR WITH A TOTAL BUDGET 
OF ALMOST SIX HUNDRED BILLION SURELY IT'S 
WORTH SPENDING COMMITMENT ON THE 
PART OF MR. CAMERON 
THE PROBLEM WE 
HAVE NOW IS THAT THE PUBLIC 
FINANCES ARE ALREADY IN A MESS IT 
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO GET 
WORSE BEFORE TWO THOUSAND TEN FOR TO US SAY 
NOW WE CAN TELL YOU FOR CERTAIN 
WHAT WILL BE IN THE TWO THOUSAND TEN BUDGET 
WITHOUT KNOWING HOW BAD THE PUBLIC 
FINANCES WILL BE BY THEN I THINK 
WOULD BE RASH L. DON'T WANT US TO 
GET INTO THE GAME OF MAKING 
PROMISES WE CAN'T KEEP 
ISN'T THAT 
AN EXCUSE IT'S SO CONVENIENT FOR 
THE OPPOSITION TO REACH FOR THAT 
EXCUSE 
IT'S THE NATURE OF EXCUSE OPPOSITION WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING 
ABOUT THIS UNLESS ANDY'S PARTY 
WANTS TO CALL A GENERAL ELECTION 
WHICH WE WILL HAPPILY FIGHT AND AIM 
TO WIN AND TAKE THE DECISIONS THIS 
COUNTRY NEEDS LIKELIHOOD IS WE 
HAVE TO WAIT TWO MORE YEARS BEFORE 
WE GET INTO POWER WE ARE GOING TO 
SEE MORE BUDGETS MORE OF THE 
CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION UNFOLD 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WILL 
BE IN THE KITTY IN TWO THOUSAND TEN 
YOU ARE 
BEING OPPORTUNISTIC 
WE WOULD NOT 
HAVE GOT OURSELVES INTO THE 
POSITION NOW WHAT DAVID CAMERON 
SAID IS WE WOULD NOT HAVE 
INTRODUCED A BUDGET THAT MADE 
SIGNIFICANT TAX CHANGES ON THE 
BACKS OF SOME OF THE POOREST PEOPLE 
IN OUR SOCIETY L. WAS AMAZED AT THE TIME 
AGAIN THAT'S EASY FOR AN TIME OPPOSITION PERSON TO SAY YOU HAVE 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A COMMITMENT 
TO TURN THAT AROUND MR. CAMERON 
HIMSELF HAS SAID THAT IT'S ATOTEMIC 
ISSUE HE WILL FIGHT THE CREWE 
ELECTION ON IT 
WE HAVE A 
GOVERNMENT THAT'S LET THE PUBLIC 
FINANCES GET OUT OF CONTROL WE 
DON'T KNOW HOW BAD IT WILL BE IN 
TWO YEARS' TIME WE CAN'T TAKE 
POWER FOR US TO SAY WE CAN TELL 
YOU FOR CERTAIN WHAT WE ARE GOING 
TO BE ABLE TO DO IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WILL BE 
RASH AT THE MOMENT THE FINANCES 
ARE NOT GREAT THEY'RE GETTING 
WORSE THEY MAY BE APPALLING BY THE 
TIME WE TAKE POWER FOR US TO GIVE 
A CLEAR COMMITMENT NOW WOULD BE 
RASH 
YOU JUST BRIEFLY YOU WERE RASH CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY 
LAST YEAR YOU KNOW HOW THE 
TREASURY WORKS HOW HOW HAS THIS 
MANAGED TO TURN INTO SUCH A MESS 
WELL IT IS DIFFICULT ISSUE IT 
CLEARLY WAS A FACTOR IN THE 
ELECTION THE REASON FOR REMOVING 
THE TEN P. TAX BAND WAS BECAUSE IT 
WASN'T A PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE 
MEASURE TO TARGET HELP ON LOWER 
PAID WORKERS AND 
GORDON BROWN 
CHAMPIONED IT WHEN HE INTRODUCED IT 
HIMSELF SO HE IS NOW SAYING IT WAS 
A MISTAKE 
IN ADVANCE OF THE TAX 
CREDIT SYSTEM WE HAVE INTRODUCED IT 
WAS AN IMMEDIATE WAY OF HELPING 
LOWER PAID WORKERS BUT THE MAJORITY 
OF BENEFICIARIES OF THE TEN P. TAX 
BAND WERE PEOPLE WHO EARNED 
HIGHER PEOPLE EARNED HIGHER UP THE 
INCOME SCALE L. THINK HE HAS BEEN 
CLEAR ABOUT THIS THE MISTAKE WAS 
THERE WAS A GROUP OF OLDER WOMEN 
PARTICULARLY BUT OLDER PEOPLE AGED 
SIXTY TO SIXTY FOUR AND A GROUP OF YOUNGER 
WORKERS WHO ARE AMONGST THE LOWER 
PAID WORKERS WHO WEREN'T HELPED 
THROUGH OTHER MEANS THAT WE HAVE 
READILY SAID THOSE ARE THE GROUPS 
WE ARE LOOKING CLEARLY AT AND 
ALISTAIR DARLING IS GOING TO COME 
WITH WITH COME BACK WITH HIS 
PROPOSALS 
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS PROPOSALS RESEARCH LIBRARY HAS DONE A STUDY 
OF THIS IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND NO WHERE CAN 
THEY FIND EITHER IN THE SPEECHES OF 
MR. BROWN AND OTHER POLITICIANS OR 
IN ANY OF THE TREASURY LITERATURE 
THAT INTRODUCED THIS THE USE OF 
THE WORD TRANSITIONAL IT WAS 
NEVER EXPLAINED IT WOULD BE 
TRANSITIONAL CAN YOU PRODUCE A 
DOCUMENTARY TO SHOW THAT 
GORDON IS 
THE MAN WHO INTRODUCED IT 
HE NEVER 
SAID TRANSITIONAL 
I THINK HE 
UNDERSTANDS WHAT HE HAD IN MIND 
WHEN HE INTRODUCED THE SYSTEM HE HE NEVER TOLD US HE NEVER USED THE 
WORD TRANSITIONAL THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS LIBRARY 
YOU HAVE CLEARLY 
DONE YOUR RESEARCH THERE HE IS MAT 
MAN WHO INTRODUCED IT HE KNOWS THE 
REASONS AND WHAT HE HAD IN MIND 
WHEN HE INTRODUCED IT WHAT HE DID 
SINCE WAS INTRODUCE A SYSTEM OF TAX 
CREDITS WELL IT'S POPL 
HE DID 
TELL US AT THE TIME 
IT'S HELPED A 
LOT OF LOWER PAID WORKERS 
I WANT 
TO LIGHTEN THE MOOD 
THERE IT'S LIGHTENED WE HAVE THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR CULTURE 
MEDIA AND SPORT IT'S A LONG TITLE 
HE IS ON OUR SOFA IT'S NOT A SOFA

FIND OUT ABOUT OUR GUESTS' CULTURAL

TWELVE POINT FOUR FIVE 
I FEEL THE NATION GETTING UP OFF 
ITS SOFAS 
IN WESTMINSTER ANOTHER DAY 
ANOTHER ROW FOR GORDON BROWN THIS 
TIME HE DECIDED TO PICK A FIGHT 
WITH SCIENTISTS OVER THE 
RECLASSIFICATION OF CANNABIS ON 
THE DAY AN INDEPENDENT REPORT 
ANNOUNCED IT SHOULD REMAIN A CLASS 
C. DRUG OUR GREAT LEADER DECIDED TO 
FLEX HIS TABLOID PLEASING MUSCLES 
AND JACQUI SMITH IS TO ANNOUNCE IT 
IS BEING UPGRADED BACK TO WHERE IT 
WAS CLASS B. WHAT'S THE FUSS ABOUT 
JENNY THE INHABITANTS OF THE 
POLITICAL GARDEN HAVE BEEN ALL OF 
FLUSTER OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS 
THEY UM AND AH OVER THE DANGERS OF 
CANNABIS IN TOUR IN TOUR TOUR 
IN TOUR DAVID BLUNKETT TOLD 
EVERYONE TO RELAX AFTER BEING 
COMILD ABOUT THE CHANGE THE 
ASSOCIATION OF CHIEF CHIEF POLICE 
OFFICERS LAST YEAR CALLED FOR IT TO 
BE RECLASSIFIED TO CLASS B. 
CONCERNS WERE RAISED OVER THE SUPER 
SKUNK AND WITH THE LINKS BETWEEN 
LONG TERM CANNABIS USE AND MENTAL 
HEALTH PROBLEMS SO ON BECOMING 
PRIME MINISTER GORDON BROWN LAST 
YEAR POPPED UP TO ANNOUNCE HIS 
INTENTION TO REGRADE CANNABIS TO A 
CLASS B. TODAY EXPERTS SLITHERED ON 
TO RECOMMEND THAT CANNABIS REMAINS 
AT CLASS C. 
TO RECOMMEND THAT CANNABIS REMAINS AT CLASS C. 
AT CLASS C. DESPITE THIS VERDICT IT SEEMS THAT 
GORDON BROWN WILL RECLASSIFY THE 
DRUG DRUG LET'S TALK TO LAWYER AND HOSE 
WORK BRINGS HIM INTO CONTACT WITH 
CANNABIS USERS 
YOU HAVE LOT OF PERSONAL 
EXPERIENCE WHAT EFFECTS DO YOU SEE 
FROM THE LONG TERM 
USE OF CANNABIS 
I REPRESENTED CRIMINALS FOR THIRTY THIRTY 
PLUS YEARS AND CHAIRED MENTAL 
HEALTH TRIBUNALS AND I SEE THE 
EFFECTS OF CANNABIS IT OFTEN 
PRODUCES DRUG INDUCED PSYCHOSIS AND 
IT CAN LEAD ON TO LONG TERM SERIOUS 
MENTAL ILLNESS 
YOU AGREE WITH GORDON BROWN'S 
DECISION TO CLASS IT AS A MORE 
DANGEROUS DRUG AGAIN BUT DO YOU 
THINK THAT IN THE MEANTIME THE 
MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNMENT ON ITS 
DRUGS POLICY IS ANY CLEARER 
THERE WAS A LOT OF COVERAGE WHEN 
THEY DECLASSIFIED IT TO A C. AND 
CERTAINLY YOUNG PEOPLE I BUMPED 
INTO FREQUENTLY AND PATIENTS WHO 
UNFORTUNATELY CAME BEFORE TRIBUNALS 
TOOK THE VIEW THE GOVERNMENT SAID 
IT IS CLASS C. IT IS DECLASSIFIED 
AND LESS IMPORTANT AND IF THEY 
DON'T CARE WE DON'T CARE LET'S 
GET ON WITH IT THE MESSAGE WENT 
OUT LOUD AND CLEAR INITIALLY AND 
THIS TIME IT HAS GOT TO GO OUT AND 
CLEAR SAYING IT IS A CLASS B. IT IS 
A SERIOUS DRUG IT CAUSES MENTAL 
PROBLEMS AND LEAD TO PROBLEMS IN A 
PERSON'S LIFE 
CHANGING THE CLASSIFICATION DOES 
HAVE DIRECT IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT 
OF CANNABIS THAT PEOPLE USE 
IRRESPECTIVE OF THE VIEWS OF THE 
SCIENTISTS AND THE THEORY I SEE IT 
ON THE STREETS I SEE IT IN THE 
COURTS AND IN TRIBUNALALS ON A 
DAILY BASIS AND I HAVE NO DOUBT 
THAT THE CLE CLASSIFICATION WAS 
RECLASSIFICATION WAS WRONG AND 
HOPEFULLY THINGS WILL GO BACK TO 
HOW THEY WERE WHEN IT GOES BACK TO 
A B. GORDON BROWN WAS RIGHT 
WE ARE JOINED BY PROFESSOR COLIN 
BLAKEMORE BLAKEMORE IF THE GOVERNMENT IGNORES PEOPLE 
LIKE YOU NOT YOUR COMMISSION IN 
THIS CASE BUT ANOTHER SIMILAR 
COMMISSION ARE YOU REDUNDANT AS AN 
EXPERT IN THIS MATTER 
THERE ARE 
CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS EVERY RIGHT TO OVERRULE EXPERT 
OPINION FOR INSTANCE IF EXPERTS 
RECOMMEND POLICY THAT IS TOO 
EXPENSIVE BUT IN THIS CASE IT IS 
HARD TO SEE WHAT THE MITIGATING 
ARGUMENTS SHOULD BE THAT LEAD THE 
GOVERNMENT TO IGNORE EXPERTS AND 
OPINION EXCEPT THE KINDS OF RUMOURS 
THAT WERE CIRCULATING IN JULY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
WHEN THIS REVIEW WAS INITIATED THAT 
CANNABIS ON THE STREETS IS TWENTY OR THIRTY 
TIMES STRONGER THAN IT USED TO BE 
IS THAT TRUE 
THERE ARE HIGHER 
INCIDENTS OF MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS 
AS A A CONSEQUENCE 
THE AVERAGE STRENGTH HAS DOUBLED IN 
THE LAST TEN YEARS BUT STUDIES 
FROM HOLLAND SUGGEST WITH STRONGER 
CANNABIS USERS TAKE LESS LIKE 
COMPARING DRINKING WHISKY AND BEER 
IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT PEOPLE ARE 
EXPOSING THEMSELVES TO EXTRA DOSES 
OF THE SUBSTANCE 
THE SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS ON THIS 
MATTER IS THAT THE SORT OF STUFF 
AVAILABLE NOW IS NOT SO MUCH 
STRONGER THAN THE OLD STUFF THAT 
IT IS A DANGER TO MENTAL HEALTH 
WELL IT IS AN ESTABLISHED DANGER 
TO MENTAL HEALTH FOR A SMALL SMALL 
FRACTION OF THE POPULATION 
THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE CONCLUDED 
THAT FIVE THOUSAND YOUNG MEN WOULD HAVE TO 
BE PREVENTED FROM EVER SMOKING 
CANNABIS IN ORDER TO RESCUE ONE 
FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SCHIZOPHRENIA AND TWENTY ONE THOUSAND YOUNG 
WOMEN WOULD HAVE TO BE PREVENTED TO 
RESCUE A WOMAN THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE THAT THE VULNERABLE VUN 
YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BE PROTECTED BY 
RECLASSIFYING CANNABIS USE HAS 
FALLEN BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT SINCE IT WAS 
CLASSIFIED AS C. 
IT HAS FALLEN 
EXACTLY IF ONE IS 
LOOKING AT THE EFFECTS OF MESSAGES 
THE MESSAGE OF THE RECLASSIFICATION 
FROM C. THE NEXT MOST POPULAR DRUG 
IS COCAINE WHICH A CLASS A DRUG 
WHAT'S THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR 
TAKING THIS DECISION WE HAVE NOT 
HEARD THE DECISION YET JACQUI 
SMITH WILL BE MAKING A STATEMENT TO 
PARLIAMENT AFTER PRIME MINISTER'S 
QUESTIONS QUESTIONS YOU SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL 
YOU YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS 
I DON'T 
KNOW WHAT'S BEEN 
WHAT IS THE 
SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR RECLASSIFYING 
IT AGAIN BACK TO A CLASS B. 
AS PROFESSOR BLAKEMORE WAS BEEN 
ACKNOWLEDGING THERE HAS BEEN A 
CHANGE IN THE STRENGTH OF THE 
CANNABIS THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE 
STREETS OF THIS COUNTRY L. TAKE THE 
POINT THAT THE EVIDENCE MAY SHOW 
THAT THAT IS NOT AS STRONG AS SOME 
OF THE REPORTS MAY SAY BUT 
NEVERTHELESS BUT THERE ARE FIGURES 
THAT SHOW THAT POLICE SEIZURES THAT 
SKUNK OR SUPER SKUNK ACCOUNT FOR 
THE MAJORITY OF SEIZURES SO IT IS 
MORE PREVALENT THAN WAS THE CASE 
BEFORE AS PROFESSOR BLAKEMORE SAID 
THERE IS AN ESTABLISHED LINK WITH 
MENTAL HEALTH AND POOR MENTAL 
HEALTH THESE ISSUES ARE 
COMPLICATED THEY ARE FINELY 
BALANCED BUT THESE ARE THE THINGS 
THAT JACQUI SMITH AND GORDON BROWN 
HAVE BEEN WEIGHING IN THE BALANCE 
CHRIS GRAYLING YOUR PARTY SAID IT 
SHOULD BE RECLASSIFIED ON THE BASIS 
OF SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL EVIDENCE 
ALONE WHAT IS IS THAT SCIENTIFIC 
AND MEDICAL EVIDENCE 
WE HAVE GOT 
TO LOOK CAREFULLY AND I HAVE BECOME 
OVER THE YEARS MORE HAWKISH ABOUT 
THIS FOR TWO REASONS L. HAVE HAD A 
LOT OF CONVERSATIONS SINCE I BECAME 
AN M. P. WITH LOCAL G. P.'S IN MY 
CONSTITUENCY WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED 
DIRECTLY YOUNG MEN IN THE AREA WHO 
DEVELOPED MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AS 
A RESULT OF OF TAKING CANNABIS AND 
THAT'S BEEN A BIG FACTOR IN MAKING 
ME CONVINCED THAT THE LINE WE HAVE 
TAKEN ON CANNABIS IS A RIGHT ONE 
THERE IS AN ODDITY IN THE WAY THE 
POLICY WORKS IF YOU HAVE CANNABIS 
CLASSIFIED AS C. C. YOU ARE SAYING IT 
IS O. K. TO TAKE CANNABIS BUT YOU 
HAVE GOT TO BUY IT FROM AN ILLEGAL 
DEALER THE CURRENT POLICY HAS BEEN 
UNSATISFACTORY IN THAT RESPONSE 
PROFESSOR YOU ARE SHAKING YOUR 
HEAD 
TWO YEARS IMPRISONMENT FOR HEAD CLASS C. AND FOURTEEN YEARS FOR SUPPLY 
IT IS ILLEGAL 
IT REMAINS ILLEGAL BUT THE MESSAGE 
THAT CAME OUT OF RECLASSIFICATION 
WAS NOT THAT THE FULL LETTER OF THE 
LAW SHOULD BE USED IN THESE 
CIRCUMSTANCES CIRCUMSTANCES YOUR PARTY SAID IT SHOULD BE ON THE 
BASIS OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL 
EVIDENCE ALONE 
THAT'S WHY WE 
SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT PROFESSOR 
BLAKEMORE I HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS 
WITH MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS IN MY 
CONSTITUENCY ABOUT YOUNG MEN WHO 
HAVE RUN INTO MENTAL HEALTH 
PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF TAKING 
CANNABISPM 
DON'T YOU THINK THAT THE CANNABISPM ADVISORY COMMITTEE TOOK THAT INTO 
ACCOUNT THEY ARE THE EXPERTS 
THAT'S WHY I SAID WE NEED TO LOOK 
AT WHAT THEY HAVE SAID HAVE HAD 
MY VIEWS HARDENED BY TALKING TO 
DOCTORS I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT 
PROFESSOR BLAKEMORE AND HIS TEAM 
HAVEN'T LOOKED AT AT THESE ISSUES 
WHY HAVE I TAKEN THE VIEW THAT I 
HAVE BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL BEEN 
GIVEN MANY MANY EXAMPLES BY 
MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS OF SITUATIONS 
WHERE THERE HAS BEEN ISSUE FOR 
YOUNG PEOPLE YOUNG MEN IN 
PARTICULAR PARTICULAR IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE YOUR WORK 
CUT OUT PROFESSOR 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US P. GORDON 
BROWN SAYS HE KNOWS WHAT MOST 
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT OH YES

ROOF A GLORIOUS DAY IN LONDON AND 
WE ARE CELEBRATING THE WEATHER BY 
BEING JOINED BY NICK ROBINSON 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS DAVID 
CAMERON GOING TO GO ON THE ANSWER 
IS WE DON'T KNOW 
WE DON'T KNOW AND 
IT IS HARD ON TEN PENCE TAX HE 
CAN'T ANSWER THE OBVIOUS COMEBACK 
FROM THE PRIME MINISTER WHICH IS 
WHAT WOULD YOU DO 
CHRIS GRAYLING 
FAILED TO ANSWER THAT 
HE HAS COME UP REASONS YESTERDAY 
IN CREWE HE WAS STOPPED ON THE 
STREET BY A SYMPATHETIC VOTER BUT 
A PERSISTENT ONE WHO THREE TIMES 
SAID TELL US YOU WILL BRING THE 
TEN PENCE TAX RATE BACK THE TRUTH 
IS THE TORIES HAVE NO PLANS TO 
BRING THE TEN PENCE TAX RATES BACK 
AND THEY HAVE OTHER TAX MEASURES 
SO I SUSPECT HE WON'T GO ON THAT 
BECAUSE IT IS TOO EASY HIT IN REPLY REPLY I SUPPOSE CHRIS GRAYLING THE 
DANGER GIVEN THE ENVIRONMENT HAS 
NEVER BEEN BETTER FOR DAVID CAMERON

RESULTS BUT THAT'S ALL WE HAVE HAD 
WE NEED TO GET ON WITH THE JOB OF 
CHALLENGING THE GOVERNMENT OVER THE 
ISSUES THAT MATTER 
I THOUGHT THAT EXCHANGE FROM CREWE 
WAS BIGGER WHEN YOU PUT THEIR 
POSITION UNPRESSURE IT KIND OF 
FALLS APART IN YOUR HANDS AND MR. 
COME RON IS CAMERON IS GOING TO 
FACE A GREATER DEGREE OF SCRUTINY 
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT PUBLIC 
BORROWING WILL BE IN TWO THOUSAND TEN HIS HIS POSITIONS DON'T STAND UP TO IT IF 
IT IS MORE OF A FIGHT LET'S HAVE 
IT IT THERE IS NO WAY GORDON BROWN WOULD 
HAVE WRITTEN A BUDGET IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AHEAD 
OF THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN ELECTION 
HE HAD POLICIES 
IN NORTHERN ROCK YOU WERE SAYING 
ADMINISTRATION A FIRE SALE YOU 
WERE DOTTING AROUND TO ALL THE 
DIFFERENT POSITIONS AND ON THE 
ECONOMY YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU 
HAVE TO HAVE A CREDIBLE POSITION 
THAT YOU STICK BY AND THE PUBLIC 
CAN SAY WE CAN TRUST THESE PEOPLE 
IN DIFFICULT TIMES BECAUSE THEY 
KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT 
YOU HAVE NOT PASS THAT HAD 
TESTAMENT TESTAMENT WELCOME TO MY NEXT TWO YEARS 
AND OURS 
ANY JOB OFFERS I'M OPEN 
ONE THING I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO 
IS SCOTLAND BENDY WENDY BECAUSE 
SHE SAYS IN FAVOUR OF A REFERENDUM 
THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF 
TROOPER RATU BABAKOBAU OF THE 
HOUSEHOLD CAVALRY REGIMENT WHO WAS 
KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN ON FRIDAY WE 
OWE HIM AND ALL OTHERS WHO HAVE 
LOST THEIR LIVES GREAT DEBT OF 
GRATITUDE MR. SPEAKER THIS MORNING 
I HAD MEETINGS WITH MINISTERIAL 
COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS IN ADDITION 
TO MY DUTIES IN THE HOUSISH HAVE 
FURTHER MEETINGS LATER TODAY 
AS THE RIGHT HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN 
IS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE HOUSE 
WITH EXPERIENCE OF UNSEATING 
SITTING PRIME MINISTER WHAT IS HIS 
OWN ESTIMATE AS TO HOW LONG HE HAS 
GOT GOT MR. SPEAKER ONCE AGAIN THE BIG 
POLICY QUESTIONS OF SUBSTANCE L. HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN 
WHAT THIS GOVERNMENT HAS DONE UNDER 
TWO PRIME MINISTERS WE HAVE 
CREATED THE HIGHEST EMPLOYMENT IN 
HISTORY WE HAVE CUT CHILD POVERTY 
AND PENSIONER POVERTY WE HAVE 
DOUBLED INVESTMENT IN HEALTH AND 
SOCIAL SERVICES WE HAVE GOT THE 
BEST EDUCATIONAL RESULTS IN OUR 
HISTORY AND NONE OF THAT WOULD 
HAVE HAPPENED UNDER A CONSERVATIVE 
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT OVER FIVE THOUSAND OF MY CONSTITUENTS IN 
NEWHAM ARE LIVING IN SUB STANDARD 
TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION PAYING 
OVER ONE THOUSAND PERCALENDAR MONTH IN 
RENT THIS IS CLEARLY UNAFFORDABLE 
FOR THOSE WHO ARE LIVING ON LOW 
INCOMES AND IT TRAPS FAMILY IN 
BENEFITS DEPENENCY WILL MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIEND CONFIRM HIS 
COMMITMENT TO BUILDING FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
AFFORDABLE NEW HOMES IN LONDON PER 
YEAR AND REVIEW THE BENEFITS SYSTEM 
TO INCENTIVISE WORK 
YES WE WILL 
AND WE HAVE MADE AVAILABLE MONEY 
FOR SEVENTY THOUSAND NEW AFFORDABLE HOMES 
INCLUDING FORTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW SOCIAL HOMES 
AND THAT'S A FIFTY PER CENT INCREASE AND HALF 
OF THESE WILL BE DELIVERED IN 
LONDON AND I WELCOME THE NEW MAYOR 
OF LONDON TO THE HOUSE AND TO SAY 
TO HIM I HOPE HE WILL CONTINUE THE 
RECORD OF HIS PREDECESSOR IN SOCIAL 
HOUSING AND CREATING AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING 
BORIS JOHNSON WALKED IN HOUSING EARLIER TO BIG CHEERS NOW DAVID 
CAMERON 
I JOIN THE PRIME MINISTER CAMERON IN PAY BE TRIBUTE TO RATU BABAKOBAU 
WHO WAS KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN ON 
FRIDAY THE WHOLE HOUSE WILL WANT 
TO SEND OUR CONDOLENCES TO EVERYONE 
CAUGHT UP IN THE BURMESE CYCLONE 
AND THE PRIME MINISTER KNOWS HE 
WILL HAVE THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE 
OPPOSITION BENCHES IN ANY ACTION 
NEEDED FOR THE AID AND ASSISTANCE 
THAT CLEARLY WILL BE NECESSARY CAN 
I ALSO JOIN THE PRIME MINISTER IN 
CONGRATULATING MY HONOURABLE FRIEND 
THE MEMBER FOR HENLEY ON HIS 
MAGNIFICENT VICTORY L. AM SURE THE 
PRIME MINISTER HAS ALWAYS SECRETLY 
WANTED TO SEE THE BACK OF KEN 
LIVINGSTONE AND I AM SURE HE WILL 
HAVE A FRUITFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH 
MY HONOURABLE FRIEND INAUDIBLE INAUDIBLE INDEED FOLLOWING THURSDAY'S 
ELECTIONS THE PRIME MINISTER SAID 
HE WOULD LISTEN AND LEAD SO LET ME 
START WITH AN ISSUE OF LEADERSHIP 
LABOUR'S LEADER IN SCOTLAND SAYS 
THERE SHOULD BE A REFERENDUM NOW ON 
SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE DOES HE 
AGREE WITH HER 
THAT IS NOT WHAT 
SHE HAS SAID MR. SPEAKER THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY THE LIBERAL 
PARTY AND THE LABOUR PARTY HAVE 
JOINED TOGETHER IN SETTING UP THE 
REVIEW COMMISSION ON DEVOLUTION I 
HOPE THAT WE CAN SEE PROGRESS IN 
THAT COMMISSION AND WE WILL REVIEW 
THE PROGRESS BEFORE MAKING ANY 
FURTHER DECISIONS AND I THOUGHT 
THAT WAS THE POLICY OF THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHO SUPPORTED 
THE COMMISSION 
I THINK THE PRIME 
MINISTER IS LOSING TOUCH WITH 
REALITY THIS IS WHAT WENDY 
ALEXANDER SAID I DON'T FEAR THE 
VERDICT OF THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE SHE 
TOLD B. B. C. SCOTLAND ON SUNDAY BRING 
IT ON WHAT ELSE COULD THAT 
POSSIBLY MEAN SO CAN I ASK HIM 
AGAIN DOES HE AGREE WITH WENDY 
ALEXANDER OR NOT IT'S NOT MUCH 
LEADERSHIP IF NO ONE IS REALLY 
FOLLOWING HIM 
MR. SPEAKER THE 
CARMEN COMMISSION HAS BEEN SET UP 
TO REVIEW THE PROGRESS OF 
DEVOLUTION I BELIEVE THAT ALL 
PARTIES IN THE HOUSE WILL WELCOME 
THE FACT THAT IT IS LOOKING AT ALL 
THESE ISSUES WHEN WE REVIEWED THE 
PROGRESS OF THE CARMEN COMMISSION 
WE CAN MAKE FURTHER DECISIONS WHAT 
THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY IN 
SCOTLAND WAS POINTING TO WAS THE 
HOLLOWNESS OF THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL 
PARTY THAT SAID THEY WANTED 
INDEPENDENCE SAID THEY WANTED IT 
IMMEDIATELY AND NOW WANT TO 
POSTPONE A REFERENDUM UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TEN 
THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS POINTING OUT 
AND SHE WAS MAKING IT CLEAR THAT 
WHAT THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY 
WAS DOING WAS AGAINST THEIR 
ELECTION MANIFESTO 
MR. SPEAKER THE 
ONE THING I THINK PEOPLE THOUGHT 
ABOUT THIS PRIME MINISTER IS HE WAS 
QUITE A GOOD POLITICAL FIXER AND HE 
HAS NOW LOST CONTROL OF THE 
SCOTTISH LABOUR PARTY SO NO 
LEADERSHIP ON THE AOUPB LET'S TURN 
ON THE UNION LET'S TURN TO 
LISTENING PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW IF 
THIS IS ANOTHER GENUINE LISTENING 
EXERCISE N. LONDON WHERE WE HAVE A 
CONSERVATIVE MAYOR ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST ISSUES AT THE ELECTION WAS 
CRIME UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT'S 
EARLY RELEASE SCHEME NEARLY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND 
PRISONERS HAVE BEEN RELEASED EARLY 
FROM PRISON THE LAST PRIME 
MINISTER WHO INTRODUCED THIS 
SCHEME ALMOST A YEAR AGO DESCRIBED 
IT AND I QUOTE AS VERY TEMPORARY 
IF THE CURRENT PRIME MINISTER IS 
SERIOUS ABOUT LISTENING WILL HE 
SCRAP IT 
WE ARE BUILDING UP THE 
NUMBER OF PRISON PLACES WE MADE AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT NEW PRISON PLACE 
THIS IS YEAR AND IN THE NEXT FEW 
YEARS AND WHEN WE HAVE BUILT UP THE 
NUMBER OF PRISON PLACES FROM THE 
SIXTY THOUSAND WE INHERITED NOW EIGHTY THOUSAND TO 
EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND AND THEN EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND WE WILL 
MAKE OUR DECISIONS ON THE RIGHT 
RIGHT THING TO DO ABOUT EARLY 
RELEASE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE 
A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE BUILT 
ENOUGH PRISON PLACES AND THAT'S 
WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO AGAIN I 
THOUGHT HE SUPPORTED US ON THE 
BUILDING OF PRISON PLACES AND SO HE 
SHOULD 
SO THAT'S A NO THEN NO SHOULD ACTION TO STOP THE EARLY RELEASE OF 
PRISONERS EVERY WEEK MORE 
PRISONERS ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED 
UNDER HIS EARLY RELEASE SCHEME HE 
IS NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE 
WHEN IT COMES TO CRIME UP AND DOWN 
THE COUNTRY PEOPLE TOLD THE 
GOVERNMENT IN THE CLEAREST POSSIBLE 
TERMS THAT THEY WANTED TO KEEP 
THEIR LOCAL POST OFFICE THE FORMER 
HOME SECRETARY THE RIGHT 
HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR NORWICH SOUTH 
THEY SHOULD LISTEN TO THE FORMER 
HOME SECRETARY HE ALWAYS HAS 
SOMETHING HELPFUL TO SAY TALKING TALKING ABOUT CHARLES CLARKE 
THE REVIEW 
SHOULD SHOULD BE SUSPENDED WILL 
THE PRIME MINISTER LISTEN TO PEOPLE 
AND HALT THE CLOSURE PROGRAMME FOR 
THE POST OFFICE 
MR. SPEAKER ONCE 
AGAIN HE IS PROPOSING TO SPEND 
MONEY HE DOESN'T HAVE HE KNOWS 
PERFECTLY WELL THAT WE ARE PUT 
PUTTING ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION INTO POST 
OFFICES THAT'S TO KEEP AS MANY 
POST OFFICES OPEN AS POSSIBLE WE 
HAVE JUST PUBLISHED THE LONDON 
RESULTS OF THE REVIEW HAVE BEEN 
PUBLISHED AND SAVE SOME OF THE 
POST OFFICES IN LONDON BUT THE 
FACT OF THE MATTER IS HE HAS NO 
MONEY TO BE ABLE TO KEEP FURTHER 
POST OFFICES OPEN AND SHOULD STOP 
MISLEADING THE ELECTORATE ABOUT 
WHAT HE CAN AND CAN'T DO 
SO THAT'S 
ANOTHER NO THEN HE IS NOT 
LISTENING TO PEOPLE ON THE POST 
OFFICE WHEN IT COMES TO THE POST 
OFFICES WHEN IT COMES TO RELEASING 
CRIMINALS WHEN IT COMES TO TAXING 
THE LOW PAID PEOPLE WILL CONCLUDE 
THIS WHOLE DISLINE LISTENING 
EXERCISE IS EMPTY WORDS SEVEN 
MONTHS AGO THE PRIME MINISTER 
CALLED OFF THE GENERAL ELECTION AND 
SAID HE WANTED MORE TIME TO SET OUT 
HIS VISION SINCE THEN WE HAVE HAD 
NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY WHITE AND GREEN PAPERS 
THIRTY FOUR GOVERNMENT BILLS SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN 
GOVERNMENT PRESS RELEASES IF HE 
HAD A COHERENT VISION WOULDN'T 
PEOPLE HAVE HEARD IT BY NOW 
SHOULDN'T EVERYONE CONCLUDE THAT WE 
HAVE GOT A GOVERNMENT THAT 
HRURPBLGS FROM ONE RELAUNCH TO 
ANOTHER AND SHOULDN'T THEY CONCLUDE 
THAT'S WHAT IS MISSING IS WHAT IS 
REALLY NEEDED AND THAT'S A CLEAR 
VISION AND STRONG LEADERSHIP FOR 
BRITAIN BRITAIN MR. SPEAKER THE CHOICE IN THIS 
COUNTRY IS BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT 
THAT THAT HAS CREATED JOBS 
STABILITY GROWTH AND PUBLIC 
SERVICES AND A CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
THAT HAS GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO 
OFFER THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY 
MR. SPEAKER WHEN I LOOKED AT WHAT 
THE CONSERVATIVE PROMISES ARE TEN 
BILLION OF TAX CUTS BLACK HOLE 
IN PUBLIC SPENDING RISK TO THE 
ECONOMY BACK TO THE SITUATION WE 
HAD IN THE EARLY NINETIES AND NO AMOUNT 
OF SLEEK SALESMANSHIP CAN OBSCURE 
THE FACT THERE IS NO SUBSTANCE IN 
EVERYTHING THE CONSERVATIVES SAY 
PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR VIEW ON THE 
CHOICE LAST WEEK THE PRIME 
MINISTER TALKS ABOUT SALESMANSHIP 
WE ALL KNOW HIS BRILLIANT 
SALESMANSHIP THIS IS THE MAN THAT 
SOLD GOLD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
MARKET THAT'S THE PROBLEM HE HAS 
NOTHING TO SELL AND HE IS USELESS 
AT SELLING IT WHILE WE ARE AT IT I 
HAVE MORE ADVICE FOR HIM THIS IS 
THE PRIME MINISTER WHO WENT ON 
AMERICAN IDOL WITH MORE MAKE UP ON 
THAN BARBARA CARTLAND THE PRIME 
MINISTER WHO SITS IN NUMBER TEN 
DOWNING STREET HE SITS IN NUMBER 
TEN DOWNING STREET WONDERING 
ORDER ORDER LEADER OF THE 
OPPOSITION 
HE SITS IN NUMBER TEN OPPOSITION DOWNING STREET WAITING FOR SHAKIRA 
TO CALL FOR GEORGE CLOONEY TO COME 
TO TEA I HAVE ADVICE FOR HIM WHY 
DOESN'T HE GIVE UP THE P. R. AND START 
BEING A. P. M. 
THIS IS THE MAN WHO 
TRIES TO LECTURE US ON PRESENTATION 
THIS IS A MAN WHO TRIES TO LECTURE 
US ON STYLE BECAUSE MR. SPEAKER 
THERE IS NO SUBSTANCE IN ANY OF HIS 
QUESTIONS MR. SPEAKER THE CHOICE 
IS BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS 
RAISED THE MINIMUM WAGE AND A 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT OPPOSED THE 
MINIMUM WAGE THE CHOICE IS BETWEEN 
A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS TAKEN A 
MILLION CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY 
AND THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT 
TREBLED POVERTY AND NO AMOUNT OF 
PRESENTATION FROM THE CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY COULD OBSCURE THE VITAL 
QUESTIONS THAT THE CHOICE IN THIS 
COUNTRY IS BETWEEN A LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT THAT DELIVERS AND A 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT JUST TALKS 
TORIES WAVING BYE BYE TO GORDON 
BROWN WHILE THAT WAS GOING ON MANY MANY FAMILIES IN PORTSMOUTH HAD TO COPE 
WITH SKY HIGH INTEREST RATES 
RAMPANT INFLATION AND LITTLE 
LIKELIHOOD OF FINDING WORK SINCE 
THEN SUSTAINED INVESTMENT IN JOBS 
AND TRAINING HAS LED TO THE HIGHEST 
EMPLOYMENT LEVELS EVER DOES MY 
RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND AGREE THIS 
IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF FIXING THE 
ROOF WHILE THE SUNSHINES 
THERE ARE 
MORE PEOPLE IN EMPLOYMENT IN THIS 
COUNTRY THAN AT ANY TIME IN OUR 
HISTORY THERE ARE MORE VACANCIES 
FOR JOBS AND WE HAVE CUT 
UNEMPLOYMENT TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL 
SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND THAT COULD NOT HAVE 
HAPPENED IF WE FOLLOWED THE 
POLICIES OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
MORE THAN THAT THERE ARE EIGHTEEN 
MILLION MORE HOME OWNERS IN THIS 
COUNTRY AND THAT COULD HAVE NOT 
HAPPENED IF WE HAD THE FIFTEEN PER CENT INTEREST 
RATES THAT WE HAD UNDER THE 
CONSERVATIVES 
MAY I ADD MY OWN CONSERVATIVES EXPRESSIONS OF SYMPATHY AND 
CONDOLENCE TO THE FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS OF TROOPER RATU BABAKOBAU 
AND ALSO I SPEAK I AM SURE I SPEAK 
ON BEHALF OF ALL MEMBERS OF THE 
HOUSE WHEN I EXTEND OUR EXPRESSIONS 
OF SYMPATHY AND CONDOLENCE TO THE 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF RAY MEKER 
THE FORMER MEMBER WHO PASSED AWAY 
LAST WEEK MR. SPEAKER 
THE 
PRIME MINISTER UNDERSTAND THE 
THREAT FROM HIS RIGHT HONOURABLE 
FRIEND THE MEMBER FOR NORWICH 
SOUTH WHEN HE SAID THAT THE 
DOUBLING OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE WILL 
REASONATE UNTIL THERE IS CLARITY 
WHEN WILL WE GET CONCRETE PROPOSALS 
TO COMPENSATE ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE 
BEEN HIT 
I ADD TO THE CONDOLENCES 
HE SENT TO THE FAMILY OF RAY MEKER 
A VERY DISTINGUISHED MEMBER OF THIS 
HOUSE CAN I SAY ABOUT THE TEN P. RATE 
HIS PARTY ARE NOT PROPOSING THE 
RESTORATION OF THE TEN P. RATE NOT AT 
ALL AND LET US ALSO SAY THE 
CHANCELLOR HAS PUT HIS LETTER TO 
THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE AND 
OUTLINED THE STEPS THAT HE IS 
TAKING TO DEAL WITH THE TWO GROUPS 
THAT WERE MISSED IS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE 
REMEMBER THOSE EVERYBODY KNOWS 
WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING THE MOST 
NEEDY HE HAS NO PRINCIPLES AND THE 
TORIES HAVE GOT NO POLICIES WILL 
HE NOW PROVIDE AN ABSOLUTE 
GUARANTEE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE LOST 
OUT WILL BE COMPENSATED IN FULL 
BACKDATED TO THE BEGINNING OF APRIL 
AND WILL NOT HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH 
HOOPS TO CLAIM WHAT IS RIGHTLY 
THEIRS 
THE CHANCELLOR WILL PUT HIS THEIRS PROPOSALS BUT THE LIBERAL PARTY OWE 
TPOESED OPPOSED THE NEW DEAL THE 
LIBERAL PARTY WANTED A LOCAL 
MINIMUM WAGE NOT A NATIONAL THE 
AND THE LIBERAL PARTY HAS OPPOSED 
OUR CHILD TAX CREDITS AND CHILD 
TRUST FUND THAT'S NOT A RECORD 
THEY SHOULD BE PROUD OF 
MR. SPEAKER 
COULD I ADD MY CONDOLENCES TO THE 
FAMILY OF THE SERVICEMAN KILLED IN 
AFGHANISTAN ON FRIDAY MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIEND IS AWARE THAT THE 
FIGHT FIGHT AGAINST CRIME IS 
ONGOING AND THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE 
CONFIDENCE WHEN THEY BRING FORWARD 
PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE THE WAY THEY 
TACKLE VIOLENT CRIME AND TERRORISM 
THAT POLICY MAKERS WILL GIVE THOSE 
PROPOSALS SERIOUS CONSIDERATION 
WHAT DOES MY RIGHT HONOURABLE 
FRIEND HAVE TO SAY TO MEMBERS OF 
THIS HOUSE WHO CLAIM TO BE ON THE 
SIDE OF THE POLICE BUT DON'T BACK 
THAT UP WITH VOTES WHEN WE BRING 
FORWARD MEASURES TO BRING IN A 
NATIONAL DATABASE AND TO IMPOSE 
MANDATORY FOR SENTENCES FOR RAPISTS 
AND THOSE WHO CARRY KNIVES 
HE IS 
RIGHT INDETERMINATE SENTENCES FOR 
ANYONE WHO COMMITTED A SERIOUS 
SEXUAL CRIME AND ALL THESE 
PROPOSALS WERE OPPOSED BY THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
DOES THE PRIME MINISTER RECALL 
AGREEING WITH ME WHEN I SUGGESTED 
TO HIM MONTH OR TWO AGO THAT THE 
HOUSE WAS GOING TO NEED A MUCH 
BETTER AND FULLER EXPLANATION AS TO 
WHY THE INCREASE IN TIME HAS BEEN 
SOUGHT BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR 
HOLDING PEOPLE IN DETENTION WITHOUT 
CHARGE WHEN IS HE GOING TO GIVE US 
THIS EXPLANATION WOULDN'T IT BE A 
GOOD TIME NOW 
THAT IS WHAT DEBATE 
AT THE MOMENT IS ABOUT AND I HAVE 
APPEALED I'VE APPEALED TO MEMBERS 
OF THIS THIS HOUSE TO LOOK AT THIS 
MATTER SO WE CAN FIND A CONSENSUS 
AND I'VE SAID THAT THE CIVIL CON 
TIN GENERALS ACT WHICH SOME PEOPLE 
USE TO FOR THIS PURPOSE WHICH 
WOULD MEAN YOU WOULD WOULD BEYOND 
TWENTY EIGHT DAYS AND HAVE TO DECLARE A STATE 
OF EMERGENCY TO DO SO THERE WOULD 
BE MANY PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE WHO 
WOULD BE PREPARED TO HAVE A PERIOD 
MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT DAYS BUT TO DO SO WE 
WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A STATE OF 
EMERGENCY I AM PROPOSINGING AND 
THE GOVERNMENT IS PROPOSING THAT WE 
GIVE POWER TO THE HOUSE THAT THE 
HEAD OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE 
WOULD HAVE TO COME TO THIS HOUSE 
WITH AN ORDER AND THE HOUSE WOULD 
HAVE TO SOCIETY FOR THE SECOND TIME 
AS WHETHER THEY APPROVED THE ACTION 
BEFORE SOMEONE WAS CHARGED FOR MORE 
THAN TWENTY EIGHT DAYS THESE ARE SAFEGUARDS 
THAT PROTECT THE CITIZEN AGAINST 
ARBITRARY TREATMENT THAT INCLUDE 
THE ACTION OF A JUDGE EVERY SEVEN 
DAYS TO REVIEW THE DETENTION 
INCLUDE ALSO A REPORT BY THE 
INDEPENDENT REVIEWER AND INCLUDE 
THE HOME SECRETARY HAVING TO COME 
TO THE HOUSE AND A FINAL REPORT 
BEING MADE ON HOW THE PROCEDURE HAD 
BEEN ADOPTED THESE ARE THE 
PROTECTION FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES THAT 
PEOPLE ASKED FOR BUT I HAVE TO 
TAKE THE ADVICE OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO 
TELL ME IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE 
HAVE A PRECAUTIONARY POWER IN PLACE 
SO IF THERE IS A MULTIPLE INCIDENT 
THEN WE CAN GO BEYOND TWENTY EIGHT DAYS WITH 
THE APPROVAL OF THE HOUSE L. HAVE 
LOOKED AT TERRORIST INCIDENTS OVER 
THE LAST FEW YEARS MR. SPEAKER AND 
I HAVE LOOKED AT SOPHISTICATION OF 
TERRORISTS WHO ARE USING MULTIPLE 
PASSPORTS USING MULTIPLE TELEPHONE 
NUMBERS AND MULTIPLE MULTIPLE E. 
MAIL ADDRESSES 
IF WE HAD A PLOT WE WOULD NEED FOR 
THAN TWENTY EIGHT DAYS TO REVIEW THE EVIDENCE 
I BELIEVE THAT MOST SENSIBLE PEOPLE 
OF THIS HOUSE AND MOST MEMBERS OF 
THE PUBLIC SUPPORT THIS POSITION 
AND I HOPE THE HOUSE VOTES FOR IT 
IN MY CONSTITUENCY THRAS JOB 
THERE IS JOB 
MR. SPEAKER SPEAKER IN BURY WE HAVE 
THE ONLY TORY LEADER IN THE COUNTRY 
WHO HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO AN 
INQUIRY INTO POSAL POSTAL VOTES 
IN MY CONSTITUENCY THERE IS JOB 
FOR ALMOST EVERYONE ABLE AND 
WILLING TO WORK 
BUT THE PRIME MINISTER WILL KNOW 
THAT THERE IS SEVERE ECONOMIC 
PRESSURE ON MANY WORKING FAMILIES 
PARTICULARLY THOSE ON LOW INCOMES 
WHAT CAN HE DO TO ASSIST IN THE 
SHORT TERM THROUGH RELIEVING THE 
PRESSURE ON TAXES AND PRICES AND IN 
THE THE LONG TERM BY INVESTING IN 
THE SKILLS OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO 
MAINTAIN FULL EMPLOYMENT IN BURY 
NORTH 
MR. SPEAKER HE IS RIGHT WE NORTH WISH THE STRENGTH OF OUR ECONOMY TO 
WITH STAND WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC 
DOWNTURN THAT IS HAPPENING 
WORLDWIDE AND WE WILL DO EVERYTHING 
IN OUR POWER WORKING WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES AS WELL AS ACTION WE 
WILL TAKE ON OUR OWN SO WE CAN WITH 
STAND THESE PROBLEMS WE WILL BE 
LOOKING AT WHAT MORE WE CAN HELP 
THE HOUSING MARKET AND TO HELP THE 
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WE WILL LOOK 
AT WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP FIRST 
TIME BUYERS WHO ARE IN A DIFFICULT 
POSITION BECAUSE OF THE RISE IN 
MORTGAGE RATES BEING CHARGED BY 
BUILDING SOCIETIES WE WILL LOOK AT 
HOW WE ARE HELPING THOSE PEOPLE WHO 
ARE SUBJECT TO HIGH UTILITY BILLS 
AND UNEMPLOYMENT WE WILL WORK WITH 
SMALL SMALL BUSINESS AND MEDIUM 
SIZED BUSINESSES TO ENSURE THEY 
HAVE THE FUNDS TO INVEST FOR THE 
FUTURE SO IN EVERY AREA WE WILL 
LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP PRIN 
WITH STAND A PROBLEM THAT IS 
HITTING AMERICA AND THE REST OF 
EUROPE AND I BELIEVE THE STRENGTH 
OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY WILL WITH 
STAND THE PROBLEMS WE FACE 
THIS IS A QUESTION ABOUT PLANNING IN KETHERING 
KETTERING 
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL AGENCIES 
WORK TOGETHER TO DELIVER THE HOMES 
IN KETTERING AND ELSEWHERE 
BUT IT IS DELIVERED WITH TRANSPORT 
STRUCK INFRA TURE THAT WE HAVE 
ALGATED OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION FOR INFRASTRUCTUREMENT 
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE RECEIVED FIFTY NINE 
MILLION AND SINCE TWO ZERO ZERO THREE NINE GOVERNMENT 
ALLOCATED OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO 
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE MADE UP OF OF 
VARIOUS GROWTH AREA INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND TRANSPORT FUNDS THIS HAS BEEN 
POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE 
TO EXPAND PUBLIC SPENDING 
MR. SPEAKER LOCAL RESIDENTS WOULD 
LIKE A MEETING WITH THE PRIME 
MINISTER SO THAT HE CAN EXPLAIN 
SO THAT HE CAN EXPLAIN TO MY 
CONSTITUENTS WHY THE GOVERNMENT'S 
PLANS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF 
HOUSES LOCALLY BY ONE THIRD BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE 
ON THE ONE HAND IS BEING MATCHED 
BY CUTS IN THE TRAIN SERVICE AND 
RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THE 
LOCAL ROAD NETWORK ON THE OTHER 
WILL THE PRIME MINISTER AGREE TO A 
MEETING MEETING MR. SPEAKER I CAN JUST SAY TO HIM 
THAT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION IS BEING 
ALLOCATED FOR STRUCK INFRA TURE AND 
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE ALLOWED RECEIVED 
MONEY HE HAS GOT TO AGREE WITH 
MONEY THAT NO GOVERNMENT SPENT MORE 
ON PUBLIC SERVICES AND PUBLIC 
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE AND HIS 
COUNTY BENEFITED AS RESULT OF THAT THAT CONGRATULATE LANCASHIRE POLICE ON 
THE WORK THEY HAVE DONE IN CLOSING 
DOWN CANNABIS FACTORIES ACROSS 
PRESTON AND WILL HE CONTINUE TO 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE USE OF 
CANNABIS AND THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS IT 
CAUSES BUT BECAUSE THERE ARE NEW 
FORMS OF CANNABIS SUCH AS SKUNK 
WHICH ARE MORE DANGEROUS AND 
STRONGER THAN PREVIOUS FORMS 
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IT IS CAUSING 
SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH CRIME 
MR. SPEAKER I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE 
WORK THAT IS DONE BY THE POLICE 
AUTHORITY AND THE POLICE IN HIS 
AREA THE HOME SECRETARY WILL BE 
MAKING STATEMENT ON THIS MATTER 
JUST AFTER QUESTION TIME BUT IT IS 
GENERALLY AGREED THAT THE QUANTITY 
AND ALSO THE TYPE OF CANNABIS THAT 
IS BEING SOLD ON THE STREETS OF OUR 
CITIES AND EQUALLY THE THREAT THAT 
IS 
THERE FOR 
THE MENTAL HEALTH OF 
MANY OF THE PEOPLE USING THAT 
MAKES IT NECESSARY THAT WE LOOK AT 
THIS MATTER AGAIN 
I BELIEVE THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS 
THAT THE HOME SECRETARY WILL PUT 
FORWARD WILL NOT ONLY BE IN LINE 
WITH WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS TO SEE 
BUT ALSO WHAT THE POLICE WANTS TO 
SEE AND I BELIEVE THE HOUSE WILL BE 
PLEASED SHE IS TAKING MEASURES FOR 
ENFORCEMENT THAT WILL BE WELCOME IN 
ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
MR. KEN LIVINGSTONE THE OUTGOING 
MAYOR OF LONDON SAID HE HAS GONE 
OF COURSE SADLY GONE MAYOR OF 
LONDON LONDON HE SAID HE SAID SORRY BORIS 
HAS SAID THAT HE IS LOOKING FORWARD 
TO DOING A SPOT OF GARDENING AND 
TAKING HIS CHILDREN TO SCHOOL WHAT 
IS THE PRIME MINISTER LOOKING 
FORWARD TO WHEN HE LEAVES OFFICE 
MR. SPEAKER I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO 
BUILDING STRONGER ECONOMY IN BRITAIN BRITAIN I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CREATING 
MORE JOBS IN OUR COUNTRYMENT I'M 
LOOKING FORWARD TO BUILDING 
BETTER HEALTH SERVICE AND I KNOW WE 
WILL GET NO HELP FROM THE WELSH 
NATIONALIST PARTY BUT WE WILL GO 
AHEAD AND DO IT FOR WALES AS WELL 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER MAY I TELL 
THE PRIME MINISTER THAT LAST WEEK 
THE WOLVERHAMPTON COUNCIL ORGANISED 
A MAY DAY CELEBRATION WHICH 
ATTRACTED OVER ONE THOUSAND TRADE UNIONIST 
WHO PAID TRIBUTE TO THEIR FELLOW 
WORKERS DOCK WORKERS IN SOUTH 
AFRICA WHO REFUSED TO HANDLE ARMS 
TO ZIMBABWE A PRINCIPLED STAND 
CAN I ASK THE PRIME MINISTER TO 
GIVE HIS SUPPORT TO THAT ACTION AND 
TO RECOGNISE THAT WHERE TRADE 
UNIONISTS ACT TO INTERVENE ON 
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS FOR 
HUMANITARIAN AID THEY ARE TO BE 
SUPPORTED EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES 
THEIR GOVERNMENTS LOOK TARREDY 
MR. SPEAKER I HAVE GIVEN SUPPORT TO 
THOSE WORKERS WHO STOPPED AN ARMS 
SHIPMENT THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO 
ZIMBABWE AND AT THE SAME TIME WE 
HAVE BEEN CALLING AT THE UNITED 
NATIONS FOR AN ARTICLES EMBARGO TO 
PREVENT OTHER ARMS GETTING INTO THE 
COUNTRY OF ZIMBABWE AT THIS TIME 
THIS IS IS CRITICAL TIME FOR 
ZIMBABWE AND I THINK IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNISE THAT 
THE AFRICAN UNION AND ALL THOSE WHO 
HAVE WHO HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE 
FUTURE OF ZIMBABWE PUT PRESSURE SO 
ANY ELECTIONS THAT TAKE PLACE IN 
ZIMBABWE ARE FREE AND FAIR 
MONITORED BY THE WHOLE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO BE SEEN 
AS FREE AND FAIR SO THAT JUSTICE IS 
DONE IN SECURING FOR THE ZIMBABWEAN 
PEOPLE THE DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS 
MR. SPEAKER DOES THE PRIME MINISTER 
UNDERSTAND THAT UNLESS HIS 
GOVERNMENT TACKLES THE SCOURGE OF 
BOVINE T. B. SOON THERE WILL BE LITTLE 
OR NO LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY LEFT IN 
THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
HE IS RIGHT THAT WE'VE GOT TO DEAL 
WITH THE DISEASE BUT THAT MUST BE 
BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE 
THAT IS AVAILABLE TO US AND THAT IS 
WHAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR 
ENVIRONMENT IS LOOKING AT 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER DO PEOPLE 
WANT TO SEE THAT THE RIGHT TO SEE 
THEIR DOCTORS IN THE EVENINGS AND 
AT THE WEEKENDS OR ARE THE TORIES 
RIGHT TO SCRAP THAT RIGHT OF CHOICE 
AND TURN THE CLOCK BACK THE THE MAJORITY OF BRITISH PEOPLE WANT 
MORE ACCESS TO THEIR G. P.'S IN THE 
EVENINGS AND AT WEEKENDS AND THE 
MAJORITY OF BRITISH PEOPLE WELCOME 
THE VOTE BY THE BRITISH MEDICAL 
ASSOCIATION THAT THEY WILL GIVE AN 
EXTRA THREE HOURS OF MEDICAL 
SERVICES EITHER ON AN EVENING OR AT 
WEEKENDS IN HALF THE AREAS OF THE 
UNITED KINGDOM AND I'M PLEASED THAT 
THAT SERVICE IS STARTING THAT'S 
WHY IT IS SURPRISING THAT THE 
CONSERVATIVE HEALTH SPOKESMAN IN 
PULSE MAGAZINE ON TWENTY NINTH APRIL SAID 
THAT HE WANTS TO RESTORE TO G. P.'S THE 
POWER TO MAKE THIS DECISION AND 
PRESUMABLY ALSO THE POWER TO THE 
G. P.'S TO BLOCK THE EXTENSION OF 
PRIMARY CARE TO NEW PROVIDERS L. 
DON BELIEVE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
ARE AGOING IN THE NATIONAL HEALTH 
SERVICE AND THAT IS WHAT IS THE 
TRADITION OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER LAST WEEKEND 
THE PRIME MINISTER CLAIMED TO SHARE 
PEOPLE'S PAIN AT THE RISING COST OF 
LIVING SO CAN HE TELL THE HOUSE HOW 
MUCH IT COST TO FILL UP A FAMILY 
CAR IN HIS CONSTITUENCY AND WHEN HE 
LAST HAD TO DO IT HIMSELF 
MR. SPEAKER THE COST OF PETROL HAS 
GONE UP AS A RESULT OF WHAT IS 
HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD 
A BARREL OF OIL IS NOW ONE HUNDRED TEN DOLLARS 
A LITRE OF PETROL 
ORDER ALLOW THE PRIME 
MINISTER TO SPEAK ALLOW HIM TO 
SPEAK THE PRIME MINISTER 
ORDER ORDER A LITRE OF PETROL IS ONE POINT ONE OH IN MANY 
PLACES AND IT IS RISING AND SOME 
OTHER PLACES THE THE IMPORTANT 
THING IS WE HAVE POSTPONED THE FUEL 
DUTY INCREASE AND WE ARE DOING WHAT 
WE CAN TO WORK WITH OPEC TO GET THE 
PRICE OF OIL DOWN THINK HE WOULD 
AGREE WITH ME THAT IN EVERY PART OF 
THE WORLD WHEN OIL PRICES RISE IT 
HITS HOUSEHOLDS AND IT HITS 
MOTORISTS AND WE'RE DOING 
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO GET THE 
PRICE OF OIL DOWN 
TOMORROW ISRAEL 
WILL CELEBRATE THE SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY 
OF HER INDEPENDENCE MR. MY 
HONOURABLE FRIEND CONGRATULATE ME 
IN JOINING THE ISRAELI PEOPLE 
PARTICULARLY IN THE HI TECH 
INDUSTRY AND WILL HE SHOW ISRAEL'S 
ASSURE ISRAEL'S OF THE U. K. SUPPORT 
INTO THE FUTURE 
I WISH TO ADD MY CONGRATULATIONS TO 
ISRAEL ON THE SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY AND 
ISRAEL HAS COME A LONG WAY LOOK 
FORWARD TO BEING PRESENT AT THE 
FINCHLEY SYNAGOGUE THIS EVENING 
ISRAEL IS PART OF SECURE MIDDLE 
EAST AND IT MUST REMAIN OPTIMISTIC 
THAT THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED AND WE 
WILL WORK WITH PEOPLE OF BOTH SIDES 
TO ENSURE A TWO STATE SOLUTION AND 
I BELIEVE THAT IS THE BEST 
GUARANTEE OF THE FUTURE OF ISRAEL 
IN THE NEXT SIXTY YEARS TO COME 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER A POP LIST 
POLL OUT TODAY OF LABOUR'S 
SUPPORTERS SAID THAT THE PRIME 
MINISTER SHOULD STEP ASIDE FOR A 
YOUNGER FRESHER AND MORE 
CHARISMATIC LEADER 
I SUSPECT A FEW OF HIS COLLEAGUES 
WERE ON THE RECEIVING END OF THE 
CALLS DOES HE NOT UNDERSTAND THE 
ANGER OF PEOPLE ABOUT HIS CRIPPLING 
TAX INCREASES WHICH HIT THE POOREST 
IN THIS COUNTRY AND HE HAS GOT TWO 
PROPOSED TAX INCREASES FOR THE 
MOTORISTS THOSE WITH FAMILY CARS 
A FOUR HUNDRED VEHICLE EXCISE DUTY AND A 
PROPOSED TWO PENCE INCREASE ON FUEL 
IN THE AUTUMN WILL HE DITCH THE 
PROPOSED TAX INCREASES BEFORE HIS 
COLLEAGUES DITCH HIM 
MR. SPEAKER IT IS RIGHT IT IS 
RIGHT THAT HOUSE HOUSEHOLDS ARE 
SUFFERING AS RESULT OF WHAT HAS 
BEEN HAPPENING IN A WORLD DOWNTURN 
AND IT IS RIGHT THAT FUEL PRICES 
HAVE GONE UP AND IT IS UNACCEPTABLE 
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE PEOPLE LOST OUT 
AS RESULT OF THAT THAT'S WHY WE 
HAVE POSTPONED THE FUEL DUTY RISE 
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE INCREASED THE 
WINTER ALLOWANCE AND THAT'S WHY WE 
HAVE NEGOTIATED WITH THE UTILITY 
COMPANIES THAT DEAL ONE HUNDRED WILL GO 
TO HELP LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN 
THIS COUNTRY I HAVE TO SAY TO HIM 
THAT NONE OF THAT HAPPENED UNDER 
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WHEN PEOPLE 
WERE SUFFERING 
LAST WEEK NESTLE OPENED A NEW 
CHOCOLATE FACTORY IN MY 
CONSTITUENCY DOES THE PRIME 
MINISTER AGREE WITH ME THAT THAT IS 
A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE BY A FOREIGN 
MULTI NATIONAL COMPANY IN THE 
BRITISH ECONOMY AND IN THE CITY OF 
YORK AND WOULD THE PRIME MINISTER 
COME TO YORK OR ASK HIS SECRETARY 
OF STATE FOR BUSINESS TO COME TO 
YORK TO SEE THE FUNDAMENTAL 
STRENGTH OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY 
I CONGRATULATE THE COMPANY IN HIS 
CONSTITUENCY THAT ARE EXPANDING AND 
THE FACT THAT LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT 
IN HIS CONSTITUENCY IS DOWN BY OVER 
EIGHTY PER CENT WHILE UNEMPLOYMENT IS RISING 
IN OTHER COUNTRIES EMPLOYMENT IS 
RISING IN BRITAIN AND THAT IS 
BECAUSE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL STRENGTH 
OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY SOMETHING 
THAT I BELIEVE THAT ALL PEOPLE WHO 
LOOK AT THAT WILL ACCEPT AND WE 
WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE MORE JOBS 
IN THIS COUNTRY 
MR. SPEAKER DOES THE PRIME MINISTER 
EVER WONDER WHY ON EARTH HE TOOK 
THE JOB 
FOR THE REASON I GAVE IN MY ANSWER 
TO THE LAST QUESTION TO CREATE 
JOBS FOR PEOPLE TO CREATE BETTER 
PUBLIC SERVICES TO TACKLE POVERTY 
AND TO MAKE BRITAIN A BETTER PLACE 
AND ISN'T IT REMARKABLE THAT NOT 
ONE QUESTION COMING FROM THE TORY 
BACKBENCHES IS ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE 
OF POLICY THEY CANNOT FACE UP TO 
THE BIG POLICY QUESTIONS FACING 
THIS NATION 
WILL WILL 
REFERRED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN 
ANSWERS TO COLLEAGUES BUT CAN HE 
TELL THE HOUSE MORE ABOUT WHAT HE 
IS DOING TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO 
ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR 
MORTGAGES HAVE THE LEEWAY WITH 
WHICH TO MANAGE THEIR BUDGETS 
HE IS RIGHT WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS 
WITH THE COUNCIL OF MORTGAGE 
LENDERS TO ENABLE MORTGAGE LENDERS 
TO GET BETTER DEAL WHEN THEY ARE 
FACED WITH DIFFICULTIES IN PAYING 
THEIR MORTGAGE BILLS AND AT THE 
SAME TIME WE PUT FORWARD PROPOSALS 
FOR A SHARED EQUITY SCHEME WHICH 
WILL ALLOW MORE PEOPLE TO BUY A 
PERCENTAGE OF THEIR HOUSE EVEN IF 
THEY ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO BUY 
ALL THEIR HOUSE AS RESULT OF 
CHANGES TO THE RATES TO MORTGAGES 
AND WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO 
HELP YOUNG HOMEBUYERS GET ON THE 
FIRST RUNG OF THE HOUSING LADDER 
NICK CLEGG GOING AGAIN ON THE TEN P. 
TAX BAND ABOLITION OF WE WILL HEAR 
FROM OUR PANEL IN SECOND FIRST 
WE ARE GOING TO HEAR WHAT YOU 
THOUGHT JENNY YOU HAVE THE E. 
MAILS MAILS LOTS OF PEOPLE FOCUSING VERY MUCH 
ON THE CANNABIS ISSUE THAT WE 
TALKED ABOUT AS WELL AND OF COURSE 
COURSE CAME UP IN PMQS 
BRIAN JAMES SAYS HAS MR. BROWN 
CONSIDERED THE IMPAB ON BRITAIN'S 
OVERCROWDED PRISONS LOTS OF YOU 
ALSO POINTING OUT THAT DEATHS FROM 
CANNABIS IN BRITAIN SAYS THE 
DANGEROUS DRUGS ARE LEGAL BUT 
DEADLY HE SAYS ALCOHOL KILLS 
FORTY THOUSAND PER YEAR AND TOBACCO ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND 
LOTS OF YOU POINTING OUT THAT 
ALCOHOL PERHAPS HAS TKAEUPBG AS 
DANGEROUS AS CANNABIS IN SOME WAYS 
SOME PERSONAL E. MAILS AS WELL WE 
HAVE BEEN GETTING TODAY THIS ONE 
SAYS I AM TWENTY ONE AND TWO MONTHS AGO I 
QUIT SMOKING CANNABIS FROM WHAT WAS 
A HEAVY DAILY HABIT RECLASSIFYING 
WILL DO LITTLE TO IMPACT THE USE OF 
THE DRUG PHUPBG YOUNG PEOPLE THE 
GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO FOCUS ON 
PROVING THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECT IT 
CAN HAVE ON YOUR LIFE IN MY 
EXPERIENCE I FOUND A LACK OF 
MOTIVATION AND LOSS OF FRIENDS A 
PARLIAMENT RUBBERSTAMP IS USELESS 
THEN AN E. MAIL THAT SAYS A MOTHER 
IT SAYS CANNABIS DOES NOT USUALLY 
KILL BUT IT CAN TAKE YOUR LIFE AWAY 
IT'S DESTROYED'S MY SON'S LIFE AND 
CAST A SHADOW OVER HIS FAMILY 
THANK YOU FOR THOSE KEEP THEM 
COMING IN WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT 
NICK 
IF 
I WAS WENDY ALEXANDER IF NICK I HAD DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER THE 
PRIME MINISTER BACKED ME AS LEADER 
OF LABOUR IN SCOTLAND PRETTY CLEAR 
AT PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS THAT 
CERTAINLY ON THAT ISSUE HE DOESN'T 
HE ACTUALLY WAS ASKED DIRECTLY 
WHETHER HE BACKED A CALL FOR A 
REFERENDUM NOW AND INSISTED THAT'S 
NOT WHAT SHE SAID WHAT STKE DID 
SAY IS BRING IT ON ATTACKING THEM 
FOR POSTPONING THE IDEA OF A 
REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE UNTIL 
TWO THOUSAND TEN 
SHE DOES SAY HAVE IT NOW TWO THOUSAND TEN CERTAINLY SOONER RATHER THAN LATER 
SHE SAID YOU MEANING THE SCOTTISH 
NATIONALISTS YOU CANNOT PROPOSE 
THE BREAKUP OF THE U. K. THEN RUN 
SCARED OF THE ISSUE FOR THREE YEARS 
WHICH IS THE LENGTH OF THE SCOTTISH 
PARLIAMENT IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO 
PUT UP OR SHUT UP L. SAY TO MR. 
SALMOND LEADER OF THE FIRST 
MINISTER BRING IT ON LET'S NOT 
HAVE IT AT THE FAG END OF THIS 
PARLIAMENT NOW IN WHAT WHAT SENSE 
CAN THAT NOT ME SHE WANTS IT NOW 
RATHER THAN LATER 
I HAVE NOT BEEN 
STUDYING WENDY'S WORDS CLOSELY TO 
GIVE YOU THE HONEST ANSWER L. THINK 
SHE IS SAYING SHE WANTS THE 
SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT TO BEGIN A 
DEBATE NOW ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT 
WANTS TO HAVE A REFERENDUM WENDY 
IS HER OWN WOMAN SHE IS PERFECTLY 
ENTITLED TO MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT 
SHE HAS MADE OTHERWISE THIS IS 
GOING TO BE A KIND OF RUNNING 
IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE PRIME 
MINISTER AND THE LEADER OF THE 
LABOUR PARTY IN SCOTLAND DON'T 
AGREE IT'S THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
DENYING THAT SHE SAID WHAT SHE SAID 
NOW WE HAVE AVT LET'S LOOK AT WHAT 
SHE SAID 
OF COURSE THERE HAVE BEEN TACTICAL 
DISCUSSIONS ON THESE ISSUES I 
MEAN 
IS IT NOT ABOUT MORE THAN MEAN TACTICS IT'S ABOUT THE FUTURE OF 
THE COUNTRY 
ABSOLUTELY WHY I 
THINK IT'S SO WORRYING THAT THE S. N. P. 
APPEAR TO BE TOYING WITH THE 
ELECTORATE OF SAYING WE WANT THIS 
IT'S THE REASON WE CAME INTO 
POLITICS BUT BY THE WAY WE ARE 
FRIGHTENED TO BRING THE MATTER 
FORWARD I DON'T FEAR THE VERDICT 
OF SCOTTISH PEOPLE BRING IT ON 
BRING IT ON IF THE ENGLISH 
LANGUAGE MEANS ANYTHING YOU ARE A 
GRADUATE IN ENGLISH BRING IT ON 
LET'S HAVE THE REFERENDUM NOW 
CERTAINLY LET'S HAVE IT SOONER 
RATHER THAN LATER WHY DOES THE 
PRIME MINISTER DENY THAT WHITE IS 
WHITE 
YOU SEEM TO BE ANALYSING WHITE WHAT IS SAID IN THE HOUSE AND WHAT 
WENDY SAID AND COMING UP WITH YOUR 
PREFERRED SOLUTION BRING IT ON 
MIGHT BE THE DEBATE I DON'T KNOW 
I THINK IT'S CLEARLY A MATTER FOR 
THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT TO DECIDE 
WHEN WHETHER IT SHOULD HAVE A 
REFERENDUM AND WHEN SHE IS IS 
RIGHTLY SAYING LET'S NOT HAVE THIS 
KIND OF PEOPLE PUSHING IT INTO 
THE DISTANCE CONSTANTLY USING THE 
THREAT OF IT TO KIND OF RUN AND 
AND CHANGE POLL SIX IN SCOTLAND 
TODAY POLITICS IN SCOTLAND THIS THIS IS WHAT DEVOLUTION HAS DONE TO 
POLITICS THE POLITICAL PARTIES ARE 
NOT ABLE TO HAVE A SINGLE 
UNIONIFIED COMMAND GORDON BROWN 
THINKING OVER THE WEEKEND WHAT CAN 
WE DO TO REASSURE MIDDLE BRITAIN 
WHICH WE MEAN MIDDLE ENGLAND IN 
TRUTH WHAT CAN WE DO THE LAST 
THING ON THEIR LIST WOULD HAVE BEEN 
LET'S TALK ABOUT SCOTTISH 
INDEPENDENCE AS THE FIRST THING WE 
DO THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN UPSET 
ABOUT THAT WENDY ALEXANDER ON THE 
OTHER HAND FOUND HERSELF BEING 
ASKED QUESTIONS AS WE HAVE SEEN 
WHICH ARE NOT ABOUT LABOUR'S 
DEFEATS IN LOCAL ELECTIONS OR IN 
THE LONDON MAYORSHIP BUT ARE ABOUT 
SCOTLAND AND SHE WANTS TO GET ON 
THE FRONT FOOT AGAINST THE S. N. P. 
AND 
I UNDERSTAND THAT LET ME AND BRING IN CHRIS GRAYLING WHAT'S 
THE POLICY OF THE CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY IS IT FOR A REFERENDUM ON 
INDEPENDENCE AND IF SO WHEN 
WE ARE 
NOT ARGUING FOR A REFERENDUM ON 
INDEPENDENCE WE HAVE SAID THAT WE 
WILL IF THERE IS A REFERENDUM 
BROUGHT BY THE SCOTTISH 
NATIONALISTS BY THE LABOUR PARTY 
THEN WE WILL CAMPAIGN IN DEFENCE OF 
THE UNION 
THE POSITION OF BOTH THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN LONDON AND 
THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN 
EDINBURGH YOU ARE BOTH AGAINST A 
REFERENDUM 
ANNABEL GOLDS HAS BEEN REFERENDUM CRITICAL OF WENDY'S COMMENTS LOOK 
AT GORDON BROWN IN THE COMMONS IT 
SPEAKS MORE ABOUT GORDON BROWN THAN 
ANYTHING ELSE HE CAN'T TAKE A STEP 
BACK AND SAY O. K. FINE WENDY 
ALEXANDER SAID ONE THING I AM 
SAYING ANOTHER THAT'S DEVOLUTION 
HE CONSTANTLY HAS TO COME UP WITH 
THE IMPLAUSIBLE DENIAL THE FACT IT 
ISN'T QUITE RIGHT WHY CAN'T HE FOR 
ONCE TELL IT AS IT IS 
CAN WE 
CLARIFY WE HAVE HAD THE 
CONSERVATIVES WE HAVE HEARD THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE AGAINST A 
REFERENDUM THAT MAY CHANGE BUT 
THAT'S THE STATEMENT MR. GRAYLING 
HAS MADE AT THE MOMENT WHAT'S THE 
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY ON A 
REFERENDUM 
WENDY WAS EXPRESSING A REFERENDUM CLEAR VIEW AS THE LEADER AND SHE IS 
HER OWN PERSON COMPLETELY RIGHT TO 
DO THAT 
IN FAVOUR OF IT 
WELL ONE 
SECOND I WAS SAYING TO YOU A 
MOMENT AGO WAS SHE SAYING LET'S 
BRING THE DEBATE ON I DON'T KNOW 
I WILL HAVE TO LOOK INTO WHAT SHE 
SAID I DON'T THINK YOU ARE RIGHT 
TO SAY THE PRIME MINISTER WAS 
NECESSARILY DISTANCING HIMSELF HE 
IS SAYING WE HAVE A COMMISSION IN 
SCOTLAND TO LOOK AT THE POWERS 
IT'S NOT TO DO WITH INDEPENDENCE 
THIS QUESTION WILL CLEARLY ARISE IN 
THE COURSE OF THOSE DELIBERATIONS 
LET'S SEE BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO 
STICK WITH THIS SUBJECT THE 
BREAKUP OF THE U. K. IS A BIG SUBJECT 
WE HAVE BEEN JOINED BY BRIAN WILSON 
HE WAS A SCOTTISH M. P. LET'S BRING 
HIM ON WELCOME TO THE DAILY 
POLITICS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
LET ME ASK YOU THIS IS IT YOUR 
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS NOW WENDY 
ALEXANDER'S POLICY THEREFORE THE 
POLICY OF THE LABOUR PARTY IN ROAD 
IN HE HAD HOLLY ROAD TO HAVE 
HOLYROOD TO HAVE A REFERENDUM AND 
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER 
IN THIS 
CONFUSED WORLD I THINK THAT 
PROBABLY IS MY UNDERSTANDING BUT 
THEN IT'S NOT WITHIN THE POWER OF 
HOLYROOD TO HAVE REFERENDUMS SO 
WHETHER THE FACT THAT IS THEIR 
POLICY IS RELEVANT TO WHETHER OR 
NOT THERE WAS A REFERENDUM IS 
ANOTHER QUESTION THAT'S WHERE THE 
ABSURDITY OF THIS COMES IN YOU 
CANNOT HAVE TWO POLICIES AT LEAST 
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TWO POLICIES ON 
A SUBJECT LIKE THIS WHICH AFFECTS 
THE WHOLE OF THE U. K. OF COURSE WHEN 
WE ARE OR MY FORMER COLLEAGUES 
CERTAINLY ARE ALL PART OF ONE 
POLITICAL MOVEMENT 
DOES IT LOOK 
LIKE IT'S DEVELOPING NOW THAT YOU 
HAVE ONE POLICY HERE IN LONDON WITH 
GORDON BROWN AND A GOVERNMENT 
KHOBG ABLOCK WITH SCOTS SAYING WE 
DON'T WANT A REFERENDUM BUT WENDY 
ALEXANDER AND EDINBURGH SAYING 
BRING IT ON 
WHICH IN SHORT WOULD 
BE A RIDICULOUS SITUATION TO BE IN 
AND WHICH YOU KNOW THE 
PERSONALITIES INVOLVED AS WELL AS I 
DO AND THE PLAUSIBILITY OF THESE 
TWO INDIVIDUALS HAVING DEVELOPED 
DIFFERENT POLICIES ON THIS 
PARTICULAR SUBJECT IS NOT STRONG 
CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN TO OUR VIEWERS 
OR AMPLIFY THAT REMARK YOU MADE AT 
THE BEGINNING THE SCOTTISH 
PARLIAMENT ITSELF DOES NOT HAVE THE 
POWER TO CALL REFERENDUM ON 
INDEPENDENCE THAT WESTMINSTER THE 
PARLIAMENT FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM 
WOULD HAVE TO GRANT PERMISSION TO 
HAVE A REFERENDUM IN SCOTLAND YEAH YEAH I MEAN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
SOMETHING VERY VERY BIG HERE WE 
ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW A 
KIND OF WHAT WE WILL DO ON MONDAY 
WE WILL HAVE A REFERENDUM WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE 
UNITED KINGDOM SOMETHING WHICH HAS 
BEEN IN PLACE FOR THREE HUNDRED YEARS WHICH 
IS IN THE EYES OF MOST PEOPLE IN 
MOST OF THE U. K. IS SOMETHING THAT 
SHOULD NOT BE UNDERCHALLENGED L. 
MEAN I SAW A KAEBLT MINISTER LAST 
KAEBLT MINISTER LAST CABINET 
MINISTER SAYING THIS HAD BEEN 
DISCUSSED AT THE CABINET AND SHE 
WAS PRESSED REPEATEDLY YES THE 
CABINET WAS BEHIND THIS L. MEAN 
IT'S JUST THIS I CAN'T MAKE HEAD 
OR TAIL OF THIS THE BRITISH 
CABINET IS DISCUSSING A REFERENDUM 
IS ASSENT AGO REFERENDUM ON THE 
FUTURE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND 
COMES OUT BY DRIBS AND DRABS ON T. V. 
INTERVIEWS AND CLARIFICATIONS AND 
COUNTERCLARIFICATIONS I CANNOT 
MAKE HEAD NOR TAIL OF IT STICK STICK WITH US WE HAVE A CABINET MINISTER 
WITH US IN LONDON ANDY YOU WERE 
AT THIS CABINET MEETING WHAT WAS 
DISCUSSED WHAT WAS DECIDED AT THE 
CABINET MEETING ON A REFERENDUM FOR 
SCOTLAND 
THERE WASN'T ANY DECISION SCOTLAND TAKEN 
WAS IT DISCUSSED 
IF 
IT WAS TAKEN IT WAS ONLY IN PASSING 
IT EITHER 
WAS OR WASN'T 
I WASN'T THERE FOR 
THE WHOLE THING I HAVE TO BE HONEST 
I DON'T RECALL IT BEING DISCUSSED 
IN ANY DETAIL NOR WAS ANY DECISION 
TAKEN BRIAN WILSON I THINK 
EXPRESSES IT VERY CLEARLY AND VERY 
WELL THESE ARE MAJOR ISSUES THEY 
AFFECT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY 
OBVIOUSLY WHILE THERE CAN BE A 
DEBATE IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT 
TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WOULD WANT A 
REFERENDUM THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO 
BE CONSIDERED ON A BROADER CANVAS 
THAN THAT 
YOU WERE NODDING WHEN 
BRIAN WILSON WAS SAYING THAT 
WESTMINSTER HAS THE ULTIMATE 
DECISION ON A REFERENDUM ON THE 
BREAKUP OF THE UNITED KINGDOM THAT 
ULTIMATELY HAS TO BE A STKAOEPB FOR 
WESTMINSTER DECISION FOR 
WESTMINSTER 
IT'S A RESERVED POWER WESTMINSTER WHEN WESTMINSTER TOOK THE DECISION 
TO CREATE A DEVOLVED PARLIAMENT 
YES THE PEOPLE DECIDED THROUGH A 
REFERENDUM BUT WESTMINSTER TAKES 
THE FINAL DECISION THEY RESERVE 
POWERS DEFENCE FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
ONE OF THOSE RESERVED WAS THE 
FUTURE OF THE CONSTITUTION IN 
OTHER WORDS IF THERE WAS TO BE 
ANOTHER STEP FOR SCOTLAND CLEARLY 
SCOTS COULD DEBATE IT COULD ARGUE 
ABOUT IT IN IN THEIR OWN PARLIAMENT 
AND PEOPLE CAN HAVE A SAY BUT THE 
ULTIMATE DECISION WILL BE ONE FOR 
WESTMINSTER IN SIMPLE TERMS IF 
THERE IS TO BE A REFERENDUM ON 
INDEPENDENCE IN THIS GOVERNMENT'S 
TIME IT'S UP TO GORDON BROWN TO SAY 
YES I WILL HAVE ONE OR NO I WON'T 
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO ODD THIS GAP 
BETWEEN HIS SCOTTISH LEADER AND 
HIMSELF ON THE ISSUE NOW IN TRUTH 
I THINK THIS IS A MATTER OF TIMING 
AND TACTICS RATHER THAN STRATEGY 
WENDY ALEXANDER WAS SICK OF FACING 
THE QUESTION IN SCOTLAND LOOK YOU 
GUYS IN THE LABOUR PARTY YOU ARE 
OPPOSED TO THE IDEA OF VOTERS 
HAVING A CHOICE ON THIS ISSUE WHY 
DON'T YOU LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE 
WHAT SHE ESSENTIALLY WANTED TO SAY 
WAS THEY'RE PLAYING GAMES THEY 
KEEP TALKING OF INDEPENDENCE BUT 
IT'S YEARS AWAY THEY'RE ARGUING 
ABOUT THE QUESTION SO WHEN SHE 
SAID BRING IT ON SHE WAS TRYING TO 
SAY WE ARE NOT SCARED WHY DON'T WE 
HAVE IT IN THE S. N. P. ARE SO SO 
CONFIDENT BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES A 
REFERENDUM WOULD BE LOST BUT SHE 
DID IT WITHOUT PROPER CONSULTATION 
AND IT SEEMS IN CONTACT HANDED WAY 
A DECISION TO BREAK UP THE U. K. WAY WOULD CERTAINLY BE THE BIGGEST 
POLITICAL DECISION IN MY LIFETIME 
AND CAREER AS A JOURNALIST WHY DID 
WENDY ALEXANDER DECIDE THAT SHE WAS 
NOW IN FAVOUR OF A REFERENDUM AND 
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER ON THIS 
ENORMOUS ISSUE AND JUST JUST 
BLURT IT OUT ON A SUNDAY T. V. SHOW I I AM NOT PRIVY TO THAT INFORMATION 
THERE ARE TWO ISSUES HERE L. 
ENDORSE THE POINT THAT'S JUST BEEN 
MADE I THINK THERE IS A GOOD CASE 
FOR A REFERENDUM IN SCOTLAND WE 
HAVE SUFFERED MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OF 
THIS TEED KWRUS DEBATE TEDIOUS 
DEBATE THIS OVERLAY OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICS AND THERE 
IS A CASE FOR BREAKING THAT TO SOME 
KIND OF CONCLUSION ONE WAY OR 
ANOTHER I SAID A FEW WEEKS AGO 
WHEN THIS COMMISSION WAS SET UP 
NOT ANOTHER COMMISSION NOT ANOTHER 
ROUND OF THIS PROCESS LET'S HAVE A 
FEW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AND THEN 
YOU KNOW WE WILL ALL KNOW WHERE WE 
STAND AND OUR CHILDREN WILL KNOW 
AND THEY WON'T HAVE TO SUFFER 
ANOTHER THIRTY YEARS OF IT SO THAT'S A 
STATABLE CASE WHAT SEEMS TO BE 
EXTRAORDINARY IS THAT SOMETHING SO 
MAJOR WHICH HAS TO BE THE DECISION 
OF THE UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENT 
BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS VERY 
VERY IMPORTANT TO THE WHOLE OF THE 
U. K. OBVIOUSLY BUT IT SHOULD HAVE 
DRIBBLED OUT IN THIS MYSTERIOUS WAY 
I DON'T KNOW EVEN IF THE INTENTION 
WASN'T TACTICAL AND LET'S HAVE A 
STORY FOR MONDAY MORNING AFTER A 
BAD ELECTION RESULT OR SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT THEN OF COURSE THE 
TIMING OF THIS MAKES IT VULNERABLE 
TO THAT CHARGE IT'S JUST FARID 
FARID FAR FAR TOO IMPORTANT TO 
GET MIXED UP IN THAT SHORT TERM 
SEARCH FOR POLITICAL ADVANTAGE 
THIS IS EITHER REAL OR ISN'T AND 
THERE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN A GREY 
AREA ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS REAL OR 
WASN'T THANK YOU 
I THINK YOU ARE IN GLASGOW IT 
LOOKS LIKE GLASGOW BEHIND YOU A 
FINAL WORD FROM NICK 
ALEX SALMOND 
HAS BY AWAY AT THE MOMENT THE S. N. P. 
ARE SAYING WE SET OUT OUR TIMETABLE 
FOR A REFERENDUM IN THE FUTURE WE 
WON'T PLAY LABOUR'S GAMES THERE IS 
A POSSIBILITY A SMALL ONE I 
SUSPECT THAT ALEX SALMOND MAY THINK 
THERE AND SIT YOU WANT A 
REFERENDUM WHEN YOU ARE THE MOST 
UNPOPULAR GOVERNMENT IN RECENT 
HISTORY FINE LET'S HAVE IT MAYBE 
WE WILL WIN MY SUSPICION IS HE WON 
BUT ALEX SALMOND IS A CALCULATING 
POLITICIAN POLITICIAN HE MAY THINK HE IS MORE LIKELY TO 
WIN A REFERENDUM FOR INDEPENDENCE 
WITH A TORY GOVERNMENT IN 
WESTMINSTER 
THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL WESTMINSTER CALCULATION THE QUESTION FOR HIM 
WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A BREAK TO 
CELEBRATE HIS WEDDING ANNIVERSARY 
DOES HE SHRUG THIS OFF AND SAY THAT 
LABOUR ARE IN A MESS OR DOES HE 
THINK I WONDER IF I WOULD WIN NOW 
THAN I WOULD IN THE FUTURE 
NICK THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH FINDS US TALKING 
ABOUT OUR NATIONAL OBSESSION HOUSE 
PRICES BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE 
WORRYING MORE ABOUT WHETHER OUR 
HOMES ARE WELL BUILT WELL DESIGNED 
AND SUSTAINABLE 
LAST MONTH THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED 
A SHORTLIST FOR THE NEW ECOTOWNS 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THEY WILL BE 
ZERO CARBON AND THEY WILL GO SOME 
WAY TO SOLVING OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE 
BY PUTTING ROOF OVER THE HEADS OF 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BY 
TWO THOUSAND TEN WILL THE DEVELOPMENTS BE ANY 
GOOD AND WILL ANYONE WANT TO LIVE 
THERE IN TWENTY YEARS TIME WAYNE 
HEMINGWAY HAS SOME GRAVE DOUBTS 
LOT OF US HAVE GOT SERIOUS 
RESERVATIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN 
DELIVER TEN ECOTOWNS THAT ARE 
ECOAND ARE GREAT PLACES TO LIVE WE 
HAVE HISTORY OVER THE LAST FORTY 
YEARS OF BUILDING POOR PLACES TO 
LIVE AND WE'RE IN ONE OF THEM NOW 
THIS IS THE CENTRAL AREA IT IS 
SUPPOSED TO BE THE PLAY AREA FOR 
KIDS THERE IS NOT ONE BIT OF PLAY 
EQUIPMENT THERE IS NOWHERE TO KICK 
A FOOTBALL IT 
IS SUNNY DAY IT IS THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND THERE IS NOT A SOUL OUT 
IS THERE ANYTHING FOR THE KIDS TO 
DO HERE NO 
NO FOOTBALL PITCHES NO NOTHING NO ACTIVITIES WHERE 
CHILDREN GO 
NO COMMUNITY HALL NOTHING NOTHING THERE IS LOT OF HOUSES HERE 
ISN'T THERE 
MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED FLATS 
HERE HERE WITH NOTHING TO DO WITH NOTHING TO DO DO THIS IS WHERE YOU COME INTO YOUR 
HOME THIS IS I'M ARRIVING HOME 
LOVELY EH A FEW TINS OF STUFF 
BLOWING AROUND RUBBISH BLOWING 
EVERYWHERE WHAT IS THIS THIRD 
WORLD I MEAN IT IS GREAT THAT THEY 
HAVE GOT BALCONIES THIS IS A 
BALCONY THAT IS ONLY BIG ENOUGH TO 
HANG YOUR WASHING OUT NOBODY HAS 
TABLES AND CHAIRS OUT BECAUSE YOU 
COULD NOT T. ANYTHING OUT THERE AT ALL ALL IF THIS WAS A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN 
JUST ABOUT ANY OTHER EUROPEAN 
COUNTRY THIS STREET WOULD BE WHAT 
IS CALLED A HOME ZONE IT WOULD BE 
A PLACE THAT'S BUILT FOR PEOPLE AND 
BIKES FIRSTLY AND CARS SECRETARY 
WE JUST GET ALL THAT WRONG AND YOU 
ARE ONLY TALK ABOUT FEW THOUSAND 
POUNDS BUT THE VALUE IN SPENDING 
THAT MONEY TOWARDS COMMUNITY 
TOWARDS ROAD SAFETY TOWARDS THE 
REAL VALUES OF LIFE INKAL KAABLE KAABLE WAYNE HEMINGWAY JOINS US NOW 
DOES IT COME DOWN TO COST YOU 
MENTION IT WOULD ONLY BE FEW 
EXTRA THOUSAND POUNDS WHY DON'T 
PEOPLE DO IT IN 
IT IS SKILLS 
THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD DESIGNERS 
BUT MOST OF THEM WHEN THEY HAVE 
ATTEMPT TODAY DO HOUSING 
DEVELOPMENTS WHEN THE HOUSING 
DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN BUILT THEY 
WASH THEIR HANDS OF IT THEY SAY IT 
OUGHT GOT LOST IN TRANSLATION 
THE ARCHITECTS ARE DESIGNING THEM 
BUT THE PLANNERS OR BUILDERS OR 
SOMEONE ISN'T IMPLEMENTING THE 
DESIGN 
WE HAVE THIS THING CALLED DESIGN DESIGN AND BUILD YOU CAN DESIGN 
SOMETHING GREAT AND WHEN YOU HAVE 
FINISHED THE DESIGN IT GETS PASSED 
OVER TO THE BUILDERS WHO CAN CUT 
CORNERS AND AND DO ANYTHING THEY 
LIKE TO SAVE COST THE PEOPLE WHO 
HAD THE VISION AT THE BEGINNING ARE 
NOT THERE WHEN THE RESIDENTS MOVE 
IN WHEN YOU DESIGN A CAR AND WHEN 
YOU DESIGN A A BLOUSE YOU ARE THERE 
AT THE CELEBRATION WHEN SOMEONE 
BUYS IT 
YET THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME UP 
WITH THE GOOD IDEAS THEY'RE GONE 
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE LEFT IN THE 
HAN THE PLANNERS IF YOU LOOK AT 
THE PLANNING SITUATION THERE IS A 
SHORTAGE OF QUALITY PLANNERS MY 
DAUGHTER IS STUDYING PLANNING AT A 
MAJOR UNIVERSITY AND ONE COURSE 
LAST YEAR SHE WAS ONE OF EIGHT 
ARCHITECTURE IS OVERSUBSCRIBED 
THAT'S CLASSED AS A SEXY SUBJECT 
IT IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE STATUS OF 
PLANNERS 
PARENTS WATCHING THIS IT PLANNERS IS A FANTASTIC PROFESSION IT IS 
WONDERFUL YOU HAVE GOT SO MUCH 
POWER IN DOING GOOD FOR BRITISH 
SOCIETY AND YET IT IS REALLY 
STRUGGLING TO ATTRACT NUMBERS AND 
IF YOU ARE FAILING TO ATTRACT 
NUMBERS YOU ARE NOT ATTRACTING 
SKILLS SKILLS IT IS THE PLANNERS AS OPPOSED TO 
THE SYSTEM ONES THERE ANYTHING THE 
GOVERNMENT COULD DO TO THE SYSTEM 
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE 
THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T BE BLAMED 
HEAVILY FOR IT 
WHAT I THINK 
IT WOULD BE MUSIC 
TO THEIR EARS 
WHAT I THINK YOU CAN DO IS YOU 
KNOW WHAT WE HAVE GOT AT THE 
MOMENT ARE THE ECOTOWNS WHICH ARE 
THE BIGGEST THINGS PEOPLE ARE TALK 
BEING IN HOUSING AND PLANNING WHICH 
WILL BE COULD BE UP TO A COUPLE OF 
HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES REALLY OF 
THE THREE MILLION YOU WANT TO TO 
DELIVER BY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OR WHATEVER IT IS 
TAKE THOSE OUT OF THOSE NUMBERS SO 
YOU DON'T GET CRITICISED FOR NOT 
DELIVERING THEM IF WE DELIVER ONE 
GOOD ECOTOWN THAT IS UP THERE WITH 
THE BEST PRACTISE IN EUROPE BECAUSE 
WE ARE WAY BEHIND WE HAVE DONE 
SOMETHING AND WE HAVE SET A PRESS 
DEN IF WE DELIVER A LOAD TO GET 
THE NUMBERS WE COULD END UP WITH 
THE PROBLEMS OF THE SIXTIES NEW TOWNS 
THE STESM NOT THE GOVERNMENT THE 
SYSTEM IS NOT THERE TO DO IT 
DO YOU RECOGNISE IT AS A PROBLEM 
PROBLEM 
I THINK WAYNE IS RAISING PROBLEM IMPORTANT ISSUES AND I'M SURE CHRIS 
WOULD AGREE AS M. P.'S WE KNOW WHERE 
THE POWER LIES AND PLANNERS ARE 
POWERFUL WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING 
AND SHAPING LOCAL NEIGHBOURHOODS 
WAYNE IS RIGHT THAT'S WHERE IF YOU 
WANT TO HAVE THE POWER THAT'S WHAT 
YOU SHOULD BE GOING TO UNIVERSITY 
FOR WHEN I LOOK AT THE COMMUNITY 
WAYNE WAS IN A FEW DAYS AGO NOT 
ENOUGH SPORTS PROVISION THERE THAT 
CAUSES ME CONCERN 
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT AS DEPARTMENT OF 
CULTURE MEDIA AND SPORT 
IF WE WENT BACK IF I HAD THE TIME 
TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE PLANS 
THAT AREA WOULD HAVE HAD SEATS 
PLAY AREAS 
IN THE ORIGINAL DESIGN 
IT WOULD 
HAVE HAD PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO MEET 
AND FOR KIDS TO DO THINGS IT HAS 
BEEN VALUE ENGINEERING WHICH THE 
DEVELOPER WILL DO BECAUSE OF THE 
GREED OF THE LAST FEW YEARS WHERE 
IT HAS BEEN EASY TO THERE IS A 
HOUSING SHORTAGE YOU VALUE 
ENGINEER ALL THE GOOD THINGS IN 
LIFE OUT AND YOU PUT PEOPLE IN 
THERE IT BECOMES A MONO CULTURAL 
PLACE TO LIVE IT ONLY ATTRACTS 
PEOPLE WHO NEED A ROOF OVER THEIR 
HEAD AND WE NEED PLACES 
WE ARE 
BUILDING THE FIRST ECOHOMES IN THE 
NORTH WEST ON AN OLD COLLIERY SITE 
COULD YOU COME AND GIVE US SOME 
ADVICE ADVICE WOULD YOU DO THAT 
OF COURSE I 
WOULD WOULD DON'T YOU NEED GREATER LOCAL 
CONTROL CONTROL THE DECISIONS ARE TAKEN BY A 
FACELESS PERSON IN BRISTOL L. THINK 
IT IS A BIG CONCERN MOST OF US 
INDIVIDUAL M. P.'S OR AS COUNCILLORS OR 
AS AS COMMUTERS 
REMEMBER IT IS 
ABOUT PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE GOT 
PEOPLE LOCALLY WHO HAVE GOT VISION 
THEY CAN GET PAST THE BRISTOL 
RUBBISH PEOPLE MAKE IT HAPPEN 
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING YOUR PASSION 
HERE HERE AND WE HAVE GOT AGREEMENT ON AIR 
WE MUST SEND A CAMERA AND SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS HAPPENS AFTER PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTION 
TIME THE HOME JACQUI SMITH THE 
HOME SECRETARY JACQUI SMITH MADE A 
STATEMENT TO M. P.'S ABOUT CANNABIS 
JACQUI SMITH AS PREDICTED DECIDED 
TO RECLASSIFY CANNABIS NOW BACK TO 
BEING WHAT IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO 
A CLASS B. DRUG THIS IS WHAT SHE 
HAD TO SAY 
MR. SPEAKER I'VE GIVEN THE 
COUNCIL'S REPORT CAREFUL 
CONSIDERATION OF THE COUNCIL'S TWENTY ONE 
RECOMMENDATIONS I ACCEPT ALL BAR 
THOSE RELATING TO CLASSIFICATION L. 
HAVE DECIDED TO RECLASSIFY CANNABIS 
TO A CLASS B. DRUG 
SUBJECT TO PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL 
MY DECISION TAKES INTO ACCOUNT 
ISSUES SUCH AS PUBLIC PERCEPTION 
AND THE NEEDS AND CONSEQUENCES FOR 
POLICING PRIORITIES 
THERE IS MR. SPEAKER A COMPELLING 
CASE FOR US TO ACT NOW RATHER THAN 
THAN RISK THE FUTURE YOUNG PEOPLE 
WHERE THERE IS A CLEAR AND SERIOUS 
PROBLEM BUT DOUBT ABOUT THE 
POTENTIAL HARM THAT WILL BE CAUSED 
WE MUST ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION 
AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC L. MAKE NO 
APOLOGY FOR THAT L. AM NOT 
TO WAIT AND SEE 
THE HOME SECRETARY ANNOUNCING THE 
RECLASSIFICATION OF CANNABIS BACK 
TO CLASS B. FROM CLASS C. 
THAT WILL PROBABLY DOMINATE THE 
NEWS FOR THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON 
YOU CAN GET MORE ON B. B. C. NEWS 
EARLIER WE ASKED OUR TWO GUESTS 
ANDY BURNHAM AND CHRIS GRAYLING TO 
GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO THEIR 
CULTURE INTERLAND IT WASN'T 
PLEASANT PLEASANT I HAD TO AVERT MY EYES

COMPARED TO TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT WHO VOTED FOR ANDY 
BURNHAM'S LIST
