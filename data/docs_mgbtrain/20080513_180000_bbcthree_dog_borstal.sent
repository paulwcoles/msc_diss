AND IF THERE WERE ASBOS FOR DOGS GEORGE THE LABRADOR WOULD HAVE ONE 
WHEN GEORGE GOES FOR THE DOGS HE MEANS BUSINESS OH SHIT 
THE OWNERS OF THESE THREE DOGS HAVE HAD ENOUGH 
IT'S TIME FOR EXTREME MEASURES 
THIS IS THE LAST RESORT FOR BAD DOGS 
SET UP ON A SECURE TEN ACRE COMPOUND IN A REMOTE PART OF THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
DOG BORSTAL IS RUN BY THREE OF BRITAIN'S TOUGHEST TRAINERS 
MY MISSION IS TO TEACH OWNERS TO TEACH DOGS WHO'S BOSS 
EACH TRAINER WILL TAKE ON ONE DOG AND ATTEMPT TO REFORM THEM 
IN JUST FOUR DAYS USING THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL TRAINING METHODS 
IT'S NOT THE SIZE OF THE DOG IT'S THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM 
BUT TO REFORM BAD DOGS THEY NEED TO TACKLE THEIR OWNERS 
GIVE ME ANY OWNER AND I'LL FIND YOU A TECHNIQUE THAT WORKS 
FOR THESE THREE DOGS FREEDOM AND BAD BEHAVIOUR ARE ABOUT TO COME TO AN END 
GEORGE IS A LABRADOR FROM THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TRACKS 
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO HE WAS RESCUED FROM A LIFE OF NEGLECT BY ANIMAL LOVER JONATHAN 
I'VE GOT FOUR DOGS TWO CATS THEY'RE JUST MY LIFE 
THEY GIVE MY WHOLE LIFE A STABILITY A ROUTINE 
AS SOON AS THE ALARM GOES OFF 
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET DOWNSTAIRS AND SEE THEM 
NOW GEORGE LIVES IN THE LAP OF LUXURY 
HE HAS A DOTING OWNER AND A DEDICATED DOG WALKER GOOD BOY 
HE'S A LOVING DOG IN THIS HOUSE 
AND HOW DOES GEORGE REPAY HIS OWNER FOR THIS PRIVILEGED LIFESTYLE 
IT REALLY IS JEKYLL AND HYDE IT'S LIKE A METAMORPHOSIS 
IT GOES FROM A GORGEOUS HAPPY SMILEY LOVING DOG 
WHAT EVERYONE THINKS A LABRADOR LOOKS LIKE 
TO JUST YOU KNOW 
THERE'S ONE COMING HERE NO 
STARTS SLAVERING WE NEED TO GET AWAY FROM HERE JAW TIGHT 
NO GEORGE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANIMAL 
GEORGE 
OH I'M SO SORRY 
I'M SO SCARED THAT'S WHY WHEN I COME TO THE PARK I TIE HIM ON ME 
WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN 
THIS IS NOT A DOG ENJOYING HIMSELF THIS IS A DOG WHO'S STRESSED 
GEORGE IS MAKING HIS OWNER'S LIFE A MISERY BUT DESPITE EVERYTHING JONATHAN IS SYMPATHETIC 
GEORGE'S PAST IS THAT HE WAS WITH A YOUNGISH COUPLE 
HE WAS LOCKED IN A YARD WITH NO FOOD NO WATER NEVER LET OUT 
AND WE THINK THAT THE GUY IN THE RELATIONSHIP WAS QUITE AGGRESSIVE 
WE'VE HAD GEORGE EIGHTEEN MONTHS NOW AND DESPITE ALL OUR EFFORTS THERE'S BEEN NO IMPROVEMENT 
AND WE'RE AT THE POINT NOW WHERE PEOPLE EITHER AVOID US OR SAY TO US 
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME YOU SHOULD NEVER TAKE ON A RESCUE DOG 
HE'S GOT PROBLEMS 
YOU SHOULD JUST GET RID OF HIM AND SPEND TIME WITH YOUR OTHER DOGS 
AND I'D LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN TO TURN ROUND TO THEM AND TELL THEM WE'VE GOT A RESULT COME ON 
EVERYTHING ELSE THEY'VE TRIED HAS FAILED 
THE LAST RESORT FOR GEORGE IS A STRETCH AT DOG BORSTAL 
HERE WE GO 
HIS FUTURE IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF TRAINER LYNNE DAVIES 
LYNNE IS AN AWARD WINNING DOG HANDLER 
AND IS RENOWNED FOR GETTING RESULTS WITH CATEGORY A INMATES 
GEORGE THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE 
I KNOW THAT GEORGE IS VERY DOG AGGRESSIVE 
IT COULD BE A MULTITUDE OF THINGS 
I WANT HIM TO BE ABLE TO GO ON A WALK AND ENJOY HIS LIFE 
BECAUSE AT THE MINUTE HE DOESN'T HE'S JUST A NERVOUS WRECK 
THE NEXT FOUR DAYS WILL TELL WHETHER GEORGE CAN EVER CHANGE LOVELY 
READY 
BUT HE'S RELUCTANT TO FACE HIS SENTENCE 
PRETTY SCARY PLACE ISN'T IT 
OH NO COME ON JUST WALK HIM IN DON'T LOOK BACK AT HIM DON'T TAKE ANY NOTICE OF HIM JUST WALK HIM IN 
HI ELLIE THIS IS JONATHAN 
BEFORE ENTERING BORSTAL ALL DOGS MUST UNDERGO A THOROUGH EXAMINATION 
TO ENSURE THEY'RE FIT ENOUGH FOR TRAINING 
DID YOU WANT THAT OH DEAR 
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO WHAT ARE YOU UP TO 
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO HAVE A SLIGHT ACCIDENT 
GEORGE YOU'RE SCARING ME DON'T WORRY 
NEXT STOP THE KENNEL BLOCK 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME GEORGE WILL HAVE BEEN APART FROM OWNER JONATHAN SINCE BEING RESCUED 
SINCE THE DAY THAT I GOT HIM HE'S NEVER BEEN IN THAT SITUATION 
AND FROM WHAT I KNOW THAT'S THE SITUATION THAT CAUSED HIS PROBLEMS 
AT LEAST GEORGE'S ACCOMMODATION IS COMFORTABLE MORE THAN CAN BE SAID FOR HIS OWNER'S 
JUST ALL LOOKS A BIT BUTCH 
A BIT AGGRESSIVE 
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT 
THE NEXT CANINE CONVICT IS BREEZING CAREFREE INTO BORSTAL 
TIZZY IS A SEVEN YEAR OLD LURCHER WHO DOES WHAT SHE LIKES WHEN SHE LIKES 
AND GOES WHEREVER TAKES HER FANCY 
THIS IS TIZZY'S HOUSE 
SHE RULES THE ROOST SHE'S THE QUEEN BEE 
SHE'S THE BOSS OF THE PROPERTY AND ALL THAT'S IN IT AND ALL THAT SHE SURVEYS 
AS A NATURAL BORN HUNTER TIZZY IS CUNNING AND AGILE 
WHEN SHE SEES SOMETHING SHE WANTS SHE TAKES IT 
WHAT'LL HAPPEN IS I'LL MAKE A SANDWICH THE PHONE WILL GO 
I'M TALKING ON THE PHONE 
BACK INTO THE KITCHEN AND THE SANDWICH IS GONE 
THAT'S THAT RUINED ISN'T IT 
TIZZY'S OWNER MERNA IS AT THE END OF HER TETHER 
AS A HEADMISTRESS 
SHE KEEPS SIX HUNDRED KIDS ON TIGHT REIN BUT IS STRUGGLING TO CONTROL ONE DOG 
I'M SKILLED IN ALL THOSE THINGS AND YET HERE WE HAVE SOME BEHAVIOUR ISSUES AND I FIND IT IRONIC 
FRUSTRATING AND EMBARRASSING 
LIKE A NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL 
TIZZY WAITS UNTIL MERNA IS OUT OF SIGHT BEFORE WREAKING HAVOC 
WHEN I COME BACK FROM WORK SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED DURING THE DAY 
WHERE SHE'S GONE BANANAS 
AND SHE'S RIPPED THE PAINT OFF 
AND THEN SHE'S TAKEN THE MORTAR OUT OF THE BRICK SO IT'S DISASTER 
AND WHEN SHE'S NOT WRECKING THE HOUSE TIZZY'S FAVOURITE PASTIME IS PLAYING TRUANT 
ONE THING THAT TIZZY DOES THAT'S REALLY OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME 
IS THAT SHE REGULARLY ESCAPES 
AND SHE'S JUST LOOKING FOR A BIG OPEN SPACE TO RUN IN AND THAT'S USUALLY THE ROAD 
TIZZY 
WHEN TIZZY'S A. W. O. L. SHE'S AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN 
AND FOR MERNA THIS IS A GRAVE MATTER 
IF DOG BORSTAL COULDN'T HELP 
THEN I FEEL I'D HAVE TO HAVE HER PUT TO SLEEP 
IT'S LAST CHANCE SALOON FOR TIZZY 
TIZZY IS ABOUT TO LEARN THE TRUE MEANING OF DISCIPLINE 
MIC MARTIN MADE HIS NAME TRAINING POLICE AND MILITARY DOGS 
HE EXPECTS PUNCTUALITY ORDER AND OBEDIENCE 
FROM DOGS AND OWNERS 
I'M THINKING HE'S A BIG THICKO OR HE WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW 
HE'D BE IN THE GREYHOUND CHAMPIONSHIPS WOULDN'T HE 
GOSH IT'S LIKE A PRISON 
MY NAME'S MIC HOW ARE YOU HELLO MIC 
HAVE YOU GOT ALL YOUR PAPERS AND STUFF YES I'LL JUST GET THEM 
O. K. IT'S VERY BLEAK I THINK ITS GOING TO BE 
DOG IN 
FROM HERE ON TIZZY'S HEADMISTRESS OWNER WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT 
THAT SHE'S THE PUPIL AND WHATEVER MIC SAYS IS LAW 
I'M GLAD HE'S TIZZY'S TRAINER AND I THINK SHE MIGHT BE THE DOG THAT DOES GET THE BETTER OF HIM 
OH GOD ARE THOSE THE TENTS ARE THOSE THE TENTS 
THE LAST INMATE SENTENCED IS A FUN LOVING CRIMINAL WITH A STUBBORN STREAK 
MEET LEXI 
SHE'S A BIT OF A MADAM LEXI LIKES TO BE CENTRE STAGE 
HYPERACTIVE BOISTEROUS 
A LITTLE BIT FEISTY AND A BIT OF A HOOLIGAN 
LEXI JUST WANTS TO HAVE FUN TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS 
BUT OWNER LISA IS NO PARTY ANIMAL 
I KNEW LIFE WOULD BE HARD WORK BUT I DIDN'T THINK FOR A MINUTE SHE'D BE THIS HYPERACTIVE A YEAR ON 
LEXI CAME HOME TWELVE MONTHS AGO WITH EX BOYFRIEND MARK 
NOW HE'S GONE LISA'S LEFT HOLDING A FIVE STONE BABY 
WHO'S DEVELOPED ATTITUDE 
I CAN'T CONTROL HER TO BE A DOG 
SHE CONTROLS ME AND TELLS ME WHAT SHE WANTS 
FOR LEXI ANYTHING THAT MOVES IS FAIR GAME 
SHE'LL TOY WITH EVERYBODY BIG OR SMALL 
NOW ONLY THE BRAVEST WILL VENTURE THROUGH LISA'S FRONT DOOR 
I CAN'T HAVE FRIENDS ROUND BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FRIGHTENED OF HER 
AND ERM SHE JUST SITS AND BARKS 
SO I HAVE TO SHUT HER AWAY SO PEOPLE TEND NOT TO COME BACK 
FOR THIS LITTLE BRUISER THE GAME IS FINALLY OVER 
LEXI WILL BE TRAINED BY ROBERT ALLEYNE 
AS A BEHAVIOURIST HIS PHILOSOPHY IS THAT TO CONTROL A DOG 
YOU MUST FIRST UNDERSTAND HOW IT THINKS 
ENGLISH BULL TERRIERS ARE RENOWNED FOR THEIR STUBBORNNESS 
WILFULNESS LACK OF READINESS TO BE RESPONSIVE 
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF LEXI'S BAD BEHAVIOUR 
ROBERT WANTS TO SEE IT FOR HIMSELF 
NO DOWN 
NO LEXI 
GET DOWN 
WHO'S CHILD IS THIS THAT'S MY BEST FRIEND'S LITTLE GIRL 
THIS ISN'T GOOD ALTHOUGH LEXI DOESN'T MEAN HARM 
ROBERT KNOWS IF SHE CARRIES ON DOWN THIS ROAD HER BEHAVIOUR COULD SOON WARRANT A COURT CASE 
IF THAT WERE YOUR DOG AND YOU GOT PROSECUTED 
UNDER THE DANGEROUS DOGS ACT I DON'T THINK I COULD GET HER OFF 
I DON'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT YOU UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUSNESS OF THAT 
COS I DON'T WANT TO EVER HAVE TO BE DEFENDING YOU 
BUT THAT WOULD GET HER PUT TO SLEEP 
ALTHOUGH THE BITING ISN'T AGGRESSIVE 
IT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER SHE'LL DO IT TO THE WRONG PERSON 
SO LOTS OF CONTROL TRAINING LOTS OF TEACHING THIS DOG WHO'S THE BOSS AND IT AIN'T THE DOG 
THE NEXT FOUR DAYS WILL BE TOUGH 
AND IF THE OWNERS WANT TO STAY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THEIR TRAINERS 
THEY MUST STICK TO DOG BORSTAL'S SCHEDULE 
COMING IN 
AT SIX P. M. THEY MUST REPORT TO THE KENNEL BLOCK TO ATTEND TO THEIR DOGS 
BUT TIZZY'S BEEN LEFT IN THE LURCH 
HEADMISTRESS MERNA IS USED TO MAKING THE TIMETABLES NOT STICKING TO THEM 
MERNA'S ALREADY HALF AN HOUR LATE 
AND MIC CAN'T STAND BAD TIME KEEPING 
MAYBE SHE'S JUST PUSHING IT IT'S NOT MY DOG AIN'T MY PROBLEM IS IT 
TAKING 
WHAT'S THE TIME 
SORRY 
YOU'VE BROKEN THE RECORD FOR BEING LATE THE LONGEST OH DEAR 
THIRTY MINUTES THE MOST I'VE EVER HAD 
THERE'S LIKE TWO OR THREE MINUTES LATE 
O. K. I'M SORRY FOR BEING LATE 
YOU'LL HAVE TO REPORT TO THE KENNELS NOW AND DO HALF AN HOUR FOR ME 
I'D LIKE YOU TO MOP ALL THIS OUT 
CLEAR ALL THIS OUT HERE AND THE SPARE KENNEL PLEASE 
I'LL JUST SHOW YOU THIS IS THE SPARE OF THE SPARE 
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THIS IS THE NUMBER TWO RIGHT 
THIS NEEDS BRUSHING MOPPING HE'LL GIVE YOU ALL THE STUFF 
HE THINKS HE'S BACK IN THE ARMY REALLY I THINK 
LIKE THAT 
I DO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE WAY HE'S SAYING THIS IS A PUNISHMENT 
SO HERE I AM LIKE CINDERELLA AND ALL THE OTHERS ARE DOING WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO 
FABULOUS GLAD THAT WASN'T ME 
CAN YOU DO FOUR THOUSAND PUSH UPS HOW CAN YOU FALL ASLEEP 
MAKES ME FEEL CROSS BECAUSE HE'S PLAYING 
HE'S PLAYING WITH ME PLAYING WITH MY EMOTIONS 
HE'S TRYING TO BE THE PUPPET MASTER 
THE OPENING BATTLE HAS STARTED HASN'T IT 
THERE WE ARE I THINK GAME SET AND MATCH 
AS NIGHT FALLS 
THE OWNERS MUST TAKE THEIR DOGS ON A ONE MILE WALK AROUND THE BASE 
LEXI AND LISA ARE LAST TO ATTEMPT THE EXERCISE 
BUT FOR THIS PARTNERSHIP A SIMPLE WALK IS ALWAYS AN ORDEAL 
THE DOG JUST TAKES THE PEE AND KNOWS IF IT SITS DOWN 
AND FLATLY REFUSES TO MOVE THERE'S VERY LITTLE SHE CAN DO ABOUT IT 
O. K. JUST TOW HER 
WITH LISA FINALLY MOVING THINGS GO FROM BAD TO WORSE 
THE PAIR HAVE ENDED UP AT A DEAD END 
LISA LISA LISA 
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL DARLIN' IT DOESN'T MATTER 
WHAT'S UP I WANT TO GO HOME 
IT'S SO NOT A BIG DEAL I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY JUST PART OF HOW SHE'S FEELING GENERALLY 
A BIT LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER HERE 
SHE'S NOT COMFORTABLE SHE'S WELL OUT OF HER COMFORT ZONE 
IT'S A STRANGE PLACE FULL OF STRANGE PEOPLE 
I THINK IT'S ALL JUST BEGINNING TO TAKE ITS TOLL A BIT 
I THINK ALL WE NEED NOW IS A THUNDER STORM AND THAT WOULD BE HER LOT SHE'D WANT TO GO HOME 
TODAY WAS VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT I EXPECTED 
IT'S BEEN QUITE AN UP AND DOWN DAY TODAY 
I'VE BEEN VERY EMOTIONAL AND I'M VERY TIRED 
I'VE GOT TO REMAIN POSITIVE 
AT THE MINUTE MY POOR DOG'S THERE AND I'M HERE 
I WANT MY DOG TO LIKE ME AND I THINK TOMORROW 
HE'S NOT GOING TO LIKE ME FOR SOME TIME 
I'M ABSOLUTELY SHATTERED I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN HERE ABOUT TWO WEEKS 
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW I'LL GET THROUGH TOMORROW 
I'VE MANAGED TODAY AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SLEEP 
SO GOODNIGHT 
BAD DOGS GEORGE TIZZY AND LEXI ARE SERVING TIME AT BORSTAL 
GEORGE MAY LOOK LIKE BUTTER WOULDN'T MELT IN HIS MOUTH 
BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING 
WILL OWNER JONATHAN MEASURE UP TO LYNNE'S HARD LINE TRAINING PROGRAMME 
WE'VE TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T DO THAT TO ANOTHER DOG 
FOR ESCAPE ARTIST TIZZY THE STAKES COULDN'T BE HIGHER 
SO FROM WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID IF I DON'T DO IT RIGHT THEN THE DOG'S DEAD YEAH 
BUT WILL IT BE MIC AND MERNA'S RELATIONSHIP THAT TAKES CENTRE STAGE 
WHAT THE FUCKING NOW THAT IN MY BOOK IS AGGRESSIVE 
WILL PARTY ANIMAL LEXI LEARN SOME MANNERS 
AND WILL OWNER LISA COPE WITH TRAINER ROBERT'S SHORT SHARP SHOCK TREATMENT 
IF SHE DOESN'T GET THIS IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HER DOG BITES THE WRONG PERSON 
DO THESE INMATES HAVE THE ABILITY TO TOW THE LINE 
THERE ARE THREE DAYS AND COUNTING 
IT'S AN EARLY RISE AT BORSTAL 
BRING IT ON MIC I'M READY 
YOU GORGEOUS BOY 
THE OWNERS ARE LEARNING THAT DOGS TAKE PRIORITY 
AND WHILE JONATHAN FULFILS HIS KENNEL DUTIES 
AT H. Q. TRAINER LYNNE WANTS TO ASSESS THE FULL EXTENT OF GEORGE'S PREDATORY BEHAVIOUR 
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS IN A CHOCOLATE LABRADOR NOT THIS EXTREME 
I'VE SEEN CHOCOLATE LABRADORS THAT WANT TO HAVE A FIGHT NO 
BUT TO THAT EXTREME 
IT'S ALMOST PIT BULL LIKE FIGHTING DOG BEHAVIOUR 
NOW WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO IS MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T DO THAT TO ANY OTHER PERSON'S DOG 
SO LYNNE'S FIRST ORDER IS THAT FROM NOW ON WHENEVER GEORGE IS OUTSIDE 
HE MUST BE MUZZLED AT ALL TIMES 
HE JUST LOOKS SO UNCOMFORTABLE I FEEL REALLY CRUEL 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I NORMALLY RECOMMEND 
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT A DOG THAT'S EITHER GOING TO DO SERIOUS HARM TO ANOTHER DOG OR PEOPLE 
DOG OUT 
HIM FEELING A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT REALLY ISN'T A BIG ISSUE 
GEORGE AND JONATHAN MUST GET USED TO THE MUZZLE QUICKLY OR NOTHING WILL BE ACHIEVED 
SO THIS COULD BE IT 
TIZZY'S IN BORSTAL FOR NOT RESPONDING TO COMMANDS 
BUT SO FAR IT'S HER OWNER MERNA'S LACK OF DISCIPLINE THAT'S BEEN THE PROBLEM 
WITH HARD MAN MIC AS HER TRAINER SHE'S LUCKY NOT TO HAVE BEEN SENT HOME 
YESTERDAY SHE WAS LATE 
I PAY NO ATTENTION TO THAT TODAY TODAY IS ANOTHER DAY 
FOR THE MOMENT THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS TO DISCUSS 
TELL ME ABOUT THIS LAST CHANCE SALOON THING 
HERE I HAVE A HOUND DOG THAT'S BORN TO RUN 
AND I CAN'T TAKE IT OFF THE LEAD SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE 
THE DOG'S NOT GOT A PROPER QUALITY OF LIFE AND NEITHER HAVE I 
IF YOU CAN'T GIVE ME THE TOOLS TO CONTROL HER 
THEN I THINK I'D HAVE TO HAVE HER PUT TO SLEEP 
SO IN A NUTSHELL IF I DON'T DO IT RIGHT THE DOG'S DEAD YES 
WITH TIZZY'S FUTURE HANGING IN THE BALANCE 
MIC WANTS TO ASCERTAIN WHO'S MORE AT FAULT DOG OR OWNER 
YOU REALLY NEED TO DEMONSTRATE LEFT RIGHT HOLD IT OVER LEFT HAND UNDERNEATH 
A CIRCUIT OF THE AGILITY COURSE WILL LET NICK SEE HOW TIZZY RESPONDS TO MERNA'S BASIC COMMANDS 
UP 
O. K. JUST TRY IT AGAIN 
MERNA'S NOT PROVING TO BE A NATURAL DOG HANDLER 
BUT TIZZY IS RESPONDING WELL TO THE CHALLENGE 
GOOD GIRL NOW GO GO 
KEEP IT GOING YEAH GO ON 
NICE TIZZY UP GOOD GIRL 
GOOD SO HOLD HOLD HOLD 
GO LET GO 
UP ON HER FIRST OUTING TIZZY'S ALREADY PROVED THAT SHE'S NOT SUCH A LOST CAUSE 
GOOD I THOUGHT SHE WAS WAS A DOG OF VERY LITTLE BRAIN TIZZY 
BUT I THINK SHE COTTONED ON BETTER STICK WITH THAT FELLA YOU KNOW 
NOW SHE'S DOING IT FOR ME SO I THINK GIVE HER CREDIT FULL CREDIT 
THE REVELATION HAS LEFT NICK UNIMPRESSED WITH MERNA'S JUDGEMENT 
WE WERE THINKING PERHAPS IT MIGHT HAVE TO BE PUT DOWN 
MAYBE SHE'S STILL THINKING THAT BUT AFTER WHAT I'VE SEEN TODAY THAT'S AN OUTRAGEOUS DECISION 
COS THERE'S ABSOLUTELY ALL WRONG WITH THAT DOG 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF BORSTAL HEADSTRONG LEXI IS ABOUT TO MEET HER MATCH 
WE'LL TO WORK ON STRENGTHENING LEXI'S LEAD COMMAND 
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO LEARN 
BECAUSE SHE'S RUNNING OUT AND JUMPING ON PEOPLE AND BITING STRANGERS AND SO ON 
AND THAT'S GOING TO GET HER PUT TO SLEEP 
AS LEXI GOES FOR THE SQUEAKY TOYS LISA MUST COMMAND HER TO LEAVE THEM ALONE 
OFF YOU GO DON'T STOP DON'T BREAK YOUR STRIDE KEEP PULLING 
KEEP PULLING PULLING PULLING 
LEXI'S JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH IN CONTROL OF HER WALKS 
AND SHE BELIEVES THAT SHE CAN GO THE WAY THAT SHE WANTS TO GO 
STOP AND START WHEN SHE WANTS TO 
KEEP GOING JUST KEEP GOING JUST KEEP GOING 
SHE'S SAYING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO THE DOG 
GOOD BAD OR INDIFFERENT AND SO THE DOG'S JUST DOING WHAT IT LIKES 
THIS IS NOT GOOD 
LISA ISN'T BEING ASSERTIVE ENOUGH 
COMPUTER SAYS NO 
WE SHOULDN'T STILL BE HERE AND HERE I AM SAYING 
DON'T LET HER DRAG YOU ROUND THE FIELD 
IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT MORNING 
LEXI'S STILL DOING AS SHE PLEASES 
LISA'S STRUGGLING TO TAKE CONTROL 
LEAVE AND ROBERT'S READY TO GIVE UP THE GHOST 
BUT OBVIOUSLY WHAT I NEED IS TO GET HER TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE 
AND ACCEPT THAT SHE'S THE ONE AFFECTING THIS DOG'S BEHAVIOUR IT'S NOT DOWN TO ANYBODY ELSE 
THERE'S MORE CHANCE OF ME BEING HEAD OF THE BN P. 
THAN THERE IS OF ME GETTING THIS THROUGH TO HER 
GEORGE HAS SPENT THE MORNING GETTING MORE COMFORTABLE WITH HIS MUZZLE 
COS WE SEEM TO BE GETTING HIM USED TO IT 
WE CAN NOW MOVE ON AND DO SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS HE'S GOT PROBLEMS WITH 
WHILE AGGRESSIVE TO OTHER DOGS GEORGE REACTS IN THE OPPOSITE WAY 
WHEN CONFRONTED BY AN UNFAMILIAR PERSON 
THERE YOU GO 
LYNNE WANTS TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE FIRST 
I DON'T GO MANY PLACES ON AN AVERAGE DAY 
IF I'M STOOD IN A QUEUE HE'S BARKED THEN PEED ON THE FLOOR YES 
THE THING IS HE CAN'T KEEP AN EYE ON BOTH SIDES 
SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING BEHIND HIM AND SOMETHING OVER HERE AND OVER THERE 
HE CAN'T KEEP AN EYE ON THEM ALL AND AGAIN 
IT'S THAT HEMMED IN FEELING THAT EVERYTHING IS CLOSING IN ON HIM 
AT HOME GEORGE HAS A FEAR OF STRANGE MEN 
TO CONQUER THIS LYNNE HAS ENLISTED THE HELP OF SOME TEST DUMMIES 
THEY'LL COME IN AND DO VARIOUS THINGS 
THEY'LL HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU I WANT YOU TO RELAX 
THEY MIGHT HAND YOU SOMETHING I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT 
IT'S GOING TO BE THEIR JOB TO GET HIS ATTENTION ON THEM AND REWARD HIM 
AS EACH MAN ENTERS THE ROOM THEY WILL GIVE GEORGE A TREAT 
MAKING THEIR PRESENCE A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE 
FOR JONATHAN AND GEORGE THESE ARE UNCHARTED WATERS 
GOOD LAD GOOD BOY 
WITHIN MINUTES GEORGE IS HAPPILY TAKING TREATS FROM THE MEN 
TO SEE GEORGE WITH LIKE A GROUP OF PEOPLE ROUND HIM LIKE THAT 
ALL COMING IN GOING AND DOING THINGS NEVER HAPPENS 
IT'S FANTASTIC 
NICE AND REWARDING 
EVERYTHING IS NICE AND RELAXED 
NOW LYNNE WANTS TO PUSH GEORGE EVEN FURTHER 
BY TAKING OFF HIS MUZZLE AND ENCOURAGING HIM TO APPROACH THE MEN ON HIS OWN 
RIGHT SO THIS IS GETTING HIM CONFIDENT WITH YOU AND WITHOUT YOU 
IT'S JUST A LITTLE EXERCISE THAT I LIKE TO DO IT'S ALMOST A GAME TO HIM 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN THE MIDDLE THEY'RE AROUND THE OUTSIDE 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEND HIM TO EACH PERSON 
O. K. INTO A SIT GIVE HIM A STROKE 
GIVE HIM A STROKE FIRST SHOW HIM YOUR HANDS 
GEORGE COME HERE COME ON KIDDO GOOD BOY 
GEORGE 
GEORGE SIT SIT 
BY REPEATING THIS POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT EXERCISE 
GEORGE IS BEGINNING TO OVERCOME HIS FEAR OF STRANGERS SIT 
GOOD BOY 
SIT 
SIT GOOD BOY 
FANTASTIC 
THAT'S GOOD FOR A WHILE NOW I'VE KNOWN 
THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE AN ANSWER THAT WE HAVEN'T GOT TO YET BECAUSE 
I COULDN'T CONTINUE YOU KNOW I MEAN I'VE PROBABLY GOT HIM FOR ANOTHER 
FIFTEEN YEARS I CAN'T SPEND FIFTEEN YEARS FEELING LIKE I FELT 
I CAN'T GET OVER IT 
IT JUST SHOWS THAT WE'VE MADE A STEP FORWARD THINGS ARE LOOKING ROSY 
HE NOW REALISES 
THAT THERE'S LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL FOR HIM 
QUITE RELIEVED 
IT'S BEEN AN EVENTFUL MORNING AND LUNCH BRINGS A BRIEF RESPITE 
FOR THE OWNERS AND A CHANCE FOR THE DOGS TO BE RESTED 
BUT AFTER A SHORT BREAK IT'S STRAIGHT BACK TO TRAINING 
TIZZY AND OWNER MERNA ARE FIRST BACK ON THE FIELD 
LURCHERS ARE BORN TO RUN AND BACK HOME IN MANCHESTER TIZZY IS A VERY CLEVER ESCAPE ARTIST 
SPECIFIC PROBLEMS NICK WANTS TO WORK ON GETTING TIZZY TO RETURN TO MERNA 
BUT HE HAS A LACK OF FAITH IN ONE HALF OF THE PARTNERSHIP 
I THINK THE PICTURE THAT IS EMERGING FROM THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE 
IS THAT THE DOG ACTUALLY ISN'T THAT BAD AT ALL 
BUT THE HANDLER JUST NEEDS A WAKE UP CALL 
LURCHERS ARE BRED TO HUNT SO RECALL IS OFTEN A PROBLEM 
IT'S GOING TO BE PROBABLY DOUBTFUL WHETHER I CAN MAKE IT GO BACK TO HER YOU KNOW WITHIN THIS SESSION 
WHAT WE DO IS WE CLIP THE DOG ONTO THE LONG LINE 
YOU RUN AWAY A LITTLE BIT YOU CALL YOUR DOG 
TIZZY UP TIZZY 
WHEN TIZZY TAKES OFF SHE CAN REACH A TOP SPEED OF THIRTY FIVE M. P. H. 
WHAT DID I SAY THIS AFTERNOON WOULD HAPPEN 
SAID IT WOULDN'T WORK DIDN'T I 
BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO IT AGAIN AND THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED THE TRAIN RECALL 
TIZZY COME HERE TIZZY 
COME ON 
IF SHE COULD JUST LEARN TO SLOW DOWN JUST GO COME 
IT'S THE LAST LITTLE BIT 
AND JUST BACK OFF A LITTLE BIT 
TIZZY COME 
TIZZY COME COME ON 
TIZZY COME 
GOOD GIRL 
STEADY STEADY COME COME HERE 
DON'T GRAB DON'T GRAB TIZZY 
TIZZY 
STEADY COME ON OH YEAH 
FINALLY A GOOD PERFORMANCE FROM BOTH DOG AND OWNER 
BUT NOW THE PRESSURE'S ON MERNA TO KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK 
IF SHE COULD JUST GET HER TIMING WITH THE RIGHT COMMANDS 
THE QUICKER THE DOG WILL PICK UP ON THE REST 
THE ONLY WAY IT WON'T WORK IS IF SHE DOESN'T DO SOMETHING RIGHT 
IT TRULY IS DOG BORSTAL AND PERSON BORSTAL TOO 
DOG OWNER BORSTAL AND IT'S JUST VERY VERY INTENSE 
AT BORSTAL ALL DOGS HAVE TWO TRAINING SESSIONS A DAY 
FOR GEORGE'S AFTERNOON SESSION 
LYNNE WANTS TO STEP THINGS UP A GEAR 
DOGS LIKE GEORGE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AT HOME AND ANY OTHER THINGS 
HOW THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH THE DOG ARE NOT GOING TO BE FUELLING 
THIS BEHAVIOUR THAT HE'S DOING OUT AND ABOUT 
AT HOME GEORGE IS AGGRESSIVE AROUND OTHER DOGS 
AND DESPITE JONATHON'S BEST EFFORTS HE'S YET TO FIND A SOLUTION 
TO DEAL WITH SUCH EXTREME BEHAVIOUR LYNNE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO CONFRONT 
IT HEAD ON AND IS PREPARED TO USE HER OWN DOG CAIN 
LYNNE HAS EQUIPPED JONATHON WITH A WATER SPRAY TO USE AS A NEGATIVE DETERRENT 
WE'LL ALMOST SATURATE HIM WITH THIS EXPERIENCE AND MAKE HIM REALISE THAT IN EVERY SITUATION IF HE ACTS 
IN THIS OUT OF CONTROL MANNER IT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE FOLLOWED BY A NO AND WATER 
THIS NEGATIVE ENFORCEMENT WILL ACT TO CHANGE GEORGE'S AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR 
O. K. PUT HIM INTO SIT JONATHON GOOD BOY 
SO ONCE HE IS IN THE SIT LET HIM GO LOOSE ON THE LEAD 
O. K. BUT IF HE GOES TO GO IN THE DOWN AGAIN BRING HIM BACK INTO THE SIT FOR ME 
O. K. AND JUST BE READY WITH THAT BOTTLE SIT 
SO HE'S COMPLETELY FIXATING WATCH HIS EYES HE'S JUST WAITING FOR ME TO COME CLOSE 
NO 
NO GOOD 
PREVENTING GEORGE'S AGGRESSION RELIES ON JONATHON 
MAKING THE RIGHT MOVES AT THE RIGHT TIMES O. K. 
SO BY PULLING HIM BACK YOU'RE TAKING HIS CHEST UP WHICH IS MAKING HIM 
IN A MORE DOMINANT POSITION 
THAT'S WHY HE'S GOING IN THE DOWN 
BECAUSE IT GIVES HIM SPRING TO LAUNCH HIMSELF FORWARD 
WITH GEORGE NOW USED TO CAIN IT'S TIME TO UP THE ANTE 
FANTASTIC GOADING HIM TO WHAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO NOT DO 
JUST SO NATURAL AND IT'S SOMETHING I WOULD AVOID AT ALL COSTS 
NO 
SORRY IT'S INTERESTING TO PUT PRESSURE ON HIM WITH DOGS THAT ARE MORE IN HIS FACE 
AS GEORGE LEARNS THAT ATTACKING HAS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES HE CHOOSES TO AVOID CONFRONTATION 
I THINK WE USED THE WATER TWICE 
AND THEN HE JUST WENT INTO AVOIDANCE SO IT WAS ALMOST LIKE LOOKING 
THE OTHER WAY AS THE DOG CAME WHICH ALTHOUGH IT IS QUITE DRAMATIC IT'S ALMOST FANTASTIC 
PRAISE HIM UP LOADS GOOD BOY 
BECAUSE IF HE WE CAN GET GEORGE TO 
WHEN HE SEES ANOTHER DOG LOOK THE WAY OR LOOK AT JONATHON WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE A BONUS 
BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOING TO BE FIXATING ON THAT DOG COMING TOWARDS HIM AND WAITING TO HAVE A LUNGE 
PRAISE HIM UP LOADS GOOD BOY LOADS OF PRAISE 
SO TO ACTUALLY STAND WITH GEORGE HERE AND THE DOG THERE 
IS QUITE STRANGE I COULDN'T SPEAK 
COME ON THEN 
IT'S SIX O'CLOCK AND ALL OWNERS MUST REPORT TO THE KENNEL BLOCK FOR THEIR EVENING DUTIES COMING IN 
YEAH WHAT'S THIS 
BUT NOT EVERYONE IS HAPPY WITH THE REGIME 
WELL THERE'S TIME SLOTS AND ALL THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS 
I STILL WANT TO GO OUT AND STILL WANT MY HOUSE AND MY SOFA 
AND BED 
MAKES ME SOUND REALLY LAZY DOESN'T IT 
SHE'S SO QUIET AND SHE'S SO INTROVERT 
I MEAN JUST THE WORST POSSIBLE OWNER FOR THIS DOG WHICH NEEDS SOMEBODY TO BE LOUD AND EXCITING 
THE DOG IS SO SWITCHED OFF TO HER IT WILL GO OFF TO ANYONE OR ANYTHING 
BECAUSE ANYONE OR ANYTHING IS MORE EXCITING THAN SHE IS 
IT IS A BIT BORING IN THERE THOUGH AND A BIT BARE ISN'T IT 
AND WE'VE JUST GOT A REAL UPHILL STRUGGLE 
COMING OUT 
WITH THE DOGS LOCKED UP FOR THE NIGHT THERE'S A NEW ARRIVAL AT CAMP 
LYNNE'S REQUESTED THE PRESENCE OF GEORGE'S BRAZILIAN DOG WALKER ANNA 
I HOPE GEORGE IS NOT DEAD NERVOUS ANY MORE 
I HOPE HE'S WELL HE'S DOING ALL RIGHT 
HI JONATHON HI 
HOW ARE YOU 
JUST YOU WAIT THE HOUSEKEEPER CUM THE WALKER 
SPENDS PROBABLY MORE TIME WALKING THE DOGS THAN JONATHON 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ANNA 
IT'S ALL VERY WELL JONATHON LEARNING WHAT TO DO AND HIM BEING ABLE TO DO IT 
IF SHE DOESN'T GET THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE DOING IT WRONG 
AND IT WON'T HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ON GEORGE AS IT IS WITH JONATHON 
I'M VERY HAPPY 
WITH THE DAY COMING TO AN END THE OWNERS CAN RELAX AND WELCOME THE NEW INMATE 
BUT LEXI'S OWNER LISA IS NOT IN THE PARTY MOOD 
JUST REALLY TIRED AGAIN 
I THINK IT'S ALL THE FRESH AIR 
IT MAKES ME REALLY TIRED 
ELSEWHERE IN THE CAMP THE SPIRIT IS DECIDEDLY MERRY 
AFTER A COUPLE OF BOTTLES OF WINE JONATHON DECIDES TO MAKE AN AWARD 
FOR GEORGE TO CELEBRATE THE DAY'S SUCCESS 
OH GOD I WON'T SLEEP TONIGHT 
AT NIGHT ENTRY TO THE KENNEL BLOCK IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN 
BUT RULES ARE THE LAST THING ON THEIR MINDS AS THEY BREACH CAMP SECURITY 
I REQUEST THIS GORGEOUS GEORGOUS IS AWARDED THIS ACCOLADE IMMEDIATELY 
PLEASE PASTE ONTO THE NAMEPLATE OF HIS KENNEL YOURS JONATHON 
KISS KISS 
RIGHT COME ON QUICK BACK TO THE WINE 
FOR LEXI TIZZY AND GEORGE THE END OF THEIR SENTENCE IS IN SIGHT 
THERE'S ONLY ONE DAY OF TRAINING LEFT BEFORE THE DOGS 
AND THEIR OWNERS WILL HAVE TO PROVE THAT THEY HAVE REFORMED 
THE PRESSURE IS ON ALL THE INMATES TO START SHOWING SOME SERIOUS IMPROVEMENT 
IT'S THE MORNING AFTER THE NIGHT BEFORE 
THERE'S JONATHON SPORTING HIS LITTLE BLUE NUMBER 
I THOUGHT IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET WET YOU MIGHT AS WELL YOU KNOW GET WET IN SWIMMING SHORTS 
HANGOVER OR NO HANGOVER ALL DOGS MUST STILL BE WALKED AND TAKEN TO THE TOILET 
IT'S AN EARLY START ON THE TRAINING FIELD FOR GEORGE JONATHON AND ANNA 
BUT AT THE KENNED BLOCK THE EVIDENCE OF LAST NIGHT'S EXCESSES HAS BEEN DISCOVERED 
I KNOW MAYBE THERE WAS A BIT OF ALCOHOL INVOLVED 
THERE ARE RULES REGARDING THE KENNEL WHICH BASICALLY MEANS 
THAT WHEN THEY'RE LOCKED UP AT NIGHT NOBODY GOES IN THERE 
MAYBE TODAY WON'T BE AS GOOD AS YESTERDAY AND YOU'LL 
END UP STRUGGLING AGAIN BECAUSE THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO 
THIS IS JUST GETTING YOU READY TO ACTUALLY COPE WHEN YOU GET BACK 
BACK HOME ANNA COULDN'T CONTROL GEORGE 
NOW LYNNE IS GOING TO SHOW HER HOW TO KEEP HIM ON A TIGHT LEASH 
WE'RE GOING TO GET HER HANDLING THE DOG AN AWFUL LOT THIS MORNING SO THAT SHE GETS USED TO IT 
OH WHAT A GOOD LAD 
ANNA MUST LEARN TO ALWAYS KEEP GEORGE ON THE LEFT 
FOCUSING HIS ATTENTION ON HER AND AWAY FROM OTHER DOGS 
DON'T START EXPLAINING THINGS TO HIM DON'T SAY TOO MANY THINGS TO HIM 
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS NO THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE 
YES YOU'RE A GOOD BOY AND THAT'S IT 
BE CONFIDENT IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
I KNOW IT'S NEW TO YOU YOU'VE GOT TO BE CONFIDENT 
GOOD GEORGE 
ANY TIME ANYONE COMES ANYWHERE NEAR YOU WITH ANOTHER DOG THIS IS YOUR POSITIONING 
DOG PERSON PERSON DOG 
WITH ANNA UP TO SPEED JONATHON'S NOW FREE TO CONCENTRATE ON TOMORROW'S TEST 
IF YOU JUST GLANCE OVER TO HER AT THE MOMENT WHAT'S HER DOG DOING 
JUST STARING AT HER LOOKING AT HER 
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT FROM YOUR DOG 
THAT EXCEPT FOR WE DON'T WANT THE DOWN 
WE ALREADY KNOW WITH YOUR DOG THAT'S WHAT HE DOES BEFORE HE ATTACKS ANOTHER DOG 
TIZZY'S OWNER IS SCHEDULED TO HAVE A LECTURE FROM MIC ON DOG LAW 
BUT HEADMISTRESS MERNA HAS MADE THE UNILATERAL DECISION TO BRING TIZZY ALONG TOO 
WHO TOLD YOU TO GET THE DOG OUT 
WHAT'S THIS TO DO WITH EFFICIENCY 
I'M ASKING YOU A QUESTION HERE 
WHO TOLD YOU TO GET THE DOG OUT 
NOBODY NOBODY PUT THE THING BACK NO COME ON 
YOU'RE WASTING GOOD TIME THERE'S A TEST TOMORROW 
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE LAW THIS MORNING 
NO ONE SAID GET THE DOG OUT DID THEY 
I'M READY FOR ACTION 
DOG IN AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S THERE DON'T WORRY DON'T GET UPSET 
LOOK AT HER CRYING NOW MY HEART'S LIKE THAT 
I'M NOT HAVING ANYONE SWEARING AT ME COS THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT 
IT'S JUST OVER THE TOP 
BUT MIC ISN'T THE ONLY ONE EXPERIENCED IN THE ART OF DRESSING PEOPLE DOWN 
I CAN HEAR HER CRYING IN THERE 
IF YOU'RE ANNOYED AT ME FOR NOT DOING WHATEVER YOU SAID BUT SAYING 
ALL THIS WHAT THE HELL NOW THAT IN MY BOOK IS AGGRESSIVE IT'S NOT ASSERTIVE 
I SUPPOSE THE THING IS MERNA I PROBABLY AM 
HONESTLY I DON'T MIND YOU SAYING THE GRASS THE MEN 
ANY OF THAT BUT IT'S WHEN YOU'RE SAYING IT TO ME THAT'S AGGRESSIVE 
I CAN'T HELP IT OF COURSE YOU CAN A BIG GROWN MAN 
NO I CAN'T MIC IT'S AGGRESSIVE MERNA I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT 
HE'S SORRY ABOUT THAT THAT'S LOVELY THANK YOU 
BUT I CAN'T CHANGE YOU SAID THE S. WORD MIC THAT WILL DO ME 
TELL ME ABOUT THE LAW NOW 
IF YOU OPEN THE MANUAL 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF BORSTAL ROBERT'S STRUGGLING TO MAKE 
A BREAKTHROUGH WITH LEXI'S OWNER LISA 
IT'S WORRYING BECAUSE I DON'T THINK LISA STILL UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE 
OF IF SHE DOESN'T GET THIS IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HER DOG BITES THE WRONG PERSON 
RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS ROBERT'S COME UP WITH A DRASTIC PLAN TO SHOCK LISA INTO ACTION 
HE'S ORGANISED TO HAVE LEXI DOGNAPPED 
START CALLING HER NOW ENCOURAGING HER TO PAY ATTENTION 
LEXI COME ON COME ON LEXI LEXI COME ON 
LEXI LEXI COME ON LEXI 
LEXI COME ON 
LEXI COME ON 
OH MY GOD 
O. K. 
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO EMPHASISE TO PEOPLE 
THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING CONTROL OF YOUR DOG OUTSIDE 
SO WE NEED TO KEEP ATTENTION ON OUR DOGS 
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON MAKING OURSELVES MUCH MORE EXCITING 
COS YOU ALREADY HAVE A DOG THAT WILL RUN OFF TO OTHER PEOPLE 
WHERE THE BLOODY HELL HAVE YOU BEEN COME ON THEN 
THE SHORT SHARP SHOCK SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED 
BUT WITH TEST DAY LOOMING LISA WILL NOW HAVE TO PUT IN 
TWICE THE EFFORT IF SHE'S TO STAND ANY CHANCE OF GETTING A PASS WITH LEXI 
LEAVE 
GOOD GIRL 
SEE HOW SHE'S ENGAGING HER DOG NOW 
GOOD GIRL 
AM I FEELING MORE UPBEAT AND MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR CHANCES IN THE FUTURE 
I'M FEELING LESS DOWNBEAT CERTAINLY BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I'VE HAD 
WITH LISA OVER THE WEEK IS SHE KIND OF GETS IT NOW AND THIS AFTERNOON IT'S GONE 
SO IF SHE CAN MAINTAIN THIS THEN I THINK SHE HAS A REALLY 
GOOD CHANCE OF DOING VERY WELL BUT THE QUESTION IS CAN SHE MAINTAIN IT 
COME ON GOOD GIRL 
AT THE KENNEL BLOCK TIZZY IS GETTING READY FOR HER FINAL TRAINING SESSION 
THAT IS IF MIC AND MERNA CAN CALL A TRUCE 
I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE AM I 
I'M NEVER GOING TO CHANGE 
TEST IS TOMORROW 
WE'VE ONLY GOT THESE HOURS LEFT SO WE'LL SEE IF MIC'S ADAPTED HIS 
BEHAVIOUR A BIT AND THAT'S WHAT I'M AFTER FOR A SUCCESSFUL DAY NOT COS I WANT TO DOMINATE HIM OR ANYTHING 
SHE SWEARS AS MUCH AS I DO 
SHE'S JUST VERY GOOD AT RESTRAINING IT AT THE RIGHT TIMES AND I SUPPOSE 
YOU DON'T GET TO THE POSITION THAT SHE'S GOT IN SOCIETY BY BEING A FOUL MOUTH LIKE ME 
RIGHT GAME ON THEN 
FOR THEIR FINAL SESSION TIZZY AND MERNA WILL BE 
PUT THROUGH THEIR PACES WITH AN ADVANCED HEELWORK DRILL 
GOOD GIRL YEAH 
GET READY RIGHT TURN TIZZY 
DON'T RUSH THE TURN LEFT TURN 
TIZZY COME ON GOOD GIRL 
THAT'S GOOD GOOD CHANGE OF PACE KEEP IT GOING 
IN THE STAND 
BOTH DOG AND OWNER HAVE DONE WELL 
THERE'S JUST ONE LAST ISSUE FOR MIC TO DEAL WITH 
AT HOME IN MANCHESTER TIZZY CAUSED THOUSANDS OF POUNDS WORTH OF DAMAGE TO MERNA'S BEDROOM WALLS 
TO HELP UNDERSTAND HER DESTRUCTIVE TENDENCIES MIC WANTS MERNA TO SEE THE WORLD THROUGH TIZZY'S EYES 
LOOK AT THAT THAT'S WHAT YOUR DOG FEELS LIKE EVERY DAY IT'S LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND IT CAN'T GET OUT 
VISUAL THING FOR YOU A BRILLIANT LESSON YEAH 
AND ONE THING YOU KNOW NOW THAT WHEN SHE'S UPSTAIRS SHE'S LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND SHE SEES 
THAT OTHER DOG AND SHE WANTS TO PLAY AND SHE SEES THE CARS 
SHE JUST GETS FRUSTRATED SO SHE STARTS SCRATCHING THE WALL 
PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME THING WITH DOGS IN CARS AND WHAT I SAY IS JUST BLACK OUT THE WINDOW 
SO THEY CAN'T LOOK OUT 
AND THEY'RE NOT URR URR URR EXACTLY 
WHAT A SUPERB LESSON THAT IS COS NOW I'VE FELT THE WAY THE DOG'S FELT YOU KNOW 
IT'S THE FINAL EVENING WALK 
THE NEXT TIME THE OWNERS SEE THEIR DOGS IT WILL BE TEST DAY 
WITH THEIR DUTIES COMPLETE THERE'S ONE LAST CHANCE FOR EVERYONE TO ENJOY A DRINK TOGETHER 
AND THIS TIME EVEN LISA HAS JOINED THE PARTY 
TODAY'S TRAINING SESSION WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD LEXI WAS BRILLIANT 
JUST THE WAY I HAVE CONTROL OVER HER WILL CHANGE AND IT HAS CHANGED 
ULTIMATELY I WANT TO SUCCEED 
I WANT HER TO BE GOOD I WANT TO PASS 
I FEEL TOWARDS THE TEST TOMORROW THAT THE DOG WILL DO VERY WELL INDEED 
BUT I WILL HAVE TO REALLY SHAKE MYSELF 
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LET THE DOG DOWN 
IT'S JUDGEMENT DAY 
THE OWNERS HAVE LESS THAN AN HOUR TO PREPARE 
LOOK AT THIS IT'S FREEZING I'VE BEEN SO COLD IN THE NIGHT 
I LOOK LIKE WHAT I HAVE DONE FOR THE LAST TWO NIGHTS LAST NIGHT 
WHICH WAS A VERY SILLY THING TO DO SO I'M EXTREMELY TIRED THIS MORNING 
MORNING 
GIRLS AGAINST BOYS GET ME DRUNK MADE ME SLEEP IN BUT I'M HERE 
THE TESTS HAVE BEEN SET AND FROM THIS POINT ON THE TRAINERS CAN ONLY WATCH AND HOPE 
WILL THE INMATES BE RELEASED WITH A PASS A DISTINCTION OR BE SENT HOME IN SHAME 
THE MORE RELAXED YOU ARE THE LESS GEORGE IS GOING TO PICK UP ON IT YES 
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL 
NERVOUS YEAH 
I REALLY WANT HER TO DO WELL I'VE GOT NO DOUBTS SHE'LL GET A DISTINCTION 
NO DOUBT IF SHE DOESN'T THEN SHE'S COMPLETELY MUFFED IT 
COME ON THEN 
LISA'S OUT WITH HER DOG 
NO YOU'RE NOT PERHAPS NOT AS RESPONSIVE AS I'D LIKE HER TO BE 
I THINK THE BIGGEST THING HERE WILL BE NERVES 
IF LISA LOSES HER NERVE THE DOG'S NOT GOING TO DO IT 
THE INDEPENDENT JUDGE IS RICHARD CLARKE 
ONE OF THE MOST RENOWNED AND RESPECTED DOG TRAINERS IN THE COUNTRY 
FIRST TO FACE HIM ARE LEXI AND LISA 
HELLO LISA NICE TO MEET YOU 
AND LEXI 
BACK HOME IN NOTTINGHAM LEXI RAN RIOT DOING EXACTLY AS SHE PLEASED 
AND IN THE PROCESS MADE OWNER LISA'S HOME A NO GO AREA 
HAVE THEY DONE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE THE JUDGE THE PECKING ORDER HAS CHANGED 
COME ON THEN GOOD GIRL WHAT'S THIS 
GOOD GIRL 
LEXI COME ON THEN FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE TEST LISA MUST KEEP LEXI TO HEEL 
A SIMPLE TASK THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE A FEW DAYS AGO 
THIS WILL EITHER GO REALLY REALLY WELL OR IT WILL GO REALLY REALLY BADLY GOOD GIRL 
YES YOU ARE YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL 
JUST COME TOWARDS ME 
NEXT RECALL OFF THE LEAD 
BEFORE BORSTAL LEXI WAS ATTRACTED TO ALMOST ANYTHING OTHER THAN HER OWNER LISA 
THIS WILL BE HER HARDEST PART OF THE TEST 
COME ON THEN LEXI 
LEXI COME ON THEN COME ON THEN 
COME ON THEN LEXI 
COME ON THEN COME ON THEN 
GOOD GIRL 
GOOD GIRL YEP YEP 
WELL DONE LISA GOOD GIRL 
LISA IS OVER THE FIRST HURDLE BUT CAN SHE STAY IN CONTROL AS LEXI IS TEMPTED AWAY WITH FOOD 
THERE'S TWO WAYS SHE CAN DO THIS SHE CAN EITHER PRE EMPT THE DOG'S BEHAVIOUR OR IF SHE'S 
NOT CONCENTRATING WHAT SHE'LL DO IS REACT TO WHAT LEXI DOES WHICH MEANS LEXI WILL GO TO GRAB THEM 
LISA WILL THEN TELL HER TO LEAVE BUT IT MAY ALREADY BE TOO LATE 
WHAT'S THIS LEAVE LEAVE 
SHE'S GIVING THAT ONE SOME THOUGHT 
GOOD GIRL 
LEAVE LEAVE 
AND FINALLY THE ULTIMATE TEMPTATION FOR ANTI SOCIAL LEXI A MOCK MOTHER AND BABY 
LEAVE 
HELLO DON'T EAT THE BABY LEAVE 
SHE'S JUMPED UP LISA'S PULLED HER BACK DOWN SO HE'LL PROBABLY DOCK HER SOME MARKS FOR THAT 
SHE'S KEEPING HER FEET UPON THE FLOOR NOW LEAVE 
THAT ERROR MAY HAVE COST HER THANK YOU 
WITH THE TEST COMPLETE IT'S THE MOMENT OF TRUTH 
HI GUYS 
ALL RIGHT MATE HELLO I HAVE A MAXIMUM OF SIXTY MARKS 
FOR THE DOG I GAVE HER FIFTY FIVE 
FOR HANDLER I HAVE A MAXIMUM OF FORTY MARKS 
I GAVE YOU THIRTY NINE 
SO OUT OF A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED MARKS YOU GOT NINETY FOUR 
AND THERE'S AN EXEMPLARY DISTINCTION 
I'D LIKE TO PRESENT YOU WITH THIS ROSETTE WELL DONE LEXI 
YOU SHOULD BE REALLY PROUD OF YOURSELVES YOU DID REALLY WELL THANK YOU 
SHE'S NOT BEEN THE EASIEST CLIENT I'VE EVER HAD 
AND MENTALLY SHE HAS WRUNG ME OUT THIS WEEK 
THE TEST WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
I AM SO CHUFFED CHUFFED TO PIECES 
TEARS OF HAPPINESS BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A DISTINCTION 
WITH A HIGH STANDARD SET TIZZY IS NEXT TO FACE THE JUDGE 
THE REASON I'M NERVOUS IS THAT THE DOG WON'T MESS IT UP BUT I MIGHT 
WHEN TIZZY CAME TO BORSTAL MERNA WAS SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT HAVING HER PUT DOWN 
IN A NUTSHELL IF I DON'T DO IT RIGHT THE DOG'S DEAD 
YEAH HAS SHE CHANGED ENOUGH TO EARN A REPRIEVE 
IF SHE'S 
SO FIRED UP AND A BIT NERVOUS SHE MIGHT ACTUALLY PUNCH HIS LIGHTS OUT 
I SENSE YOU'RE QUITE NERVOUS MERNA 
ARE YOU A LITTLE NERVOUS YES 
BE CONFIDENT I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE A HEADMISTRESS 
YES SO JUST BE A HEADMISTRESS WITH YOUR DOG O. K. 
SOMEONE SAID DO YOU GET NERVOUS WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING STUDENTS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TEST 
NO HANDLER AND DOG NORMAL PACE FORWARD 
GOOD GIRL STEADY 
RIGHT TURN TIZZY HEEL GOOD GIRL 
FIRST MERNA WILL HAVE TO KEEP TIZZY TO HEEL WHILE SHE FOLLOWS RICHARD'S COMMANDS

GOOD TECHNIQUE THERE MERNA 
HEEL READY TIZZY WOO YEAH

SHE'S HEADING FOR A SCRAPE AT THE MOMENT 
NOW THE BIG TEST 
LAST IT'S RECALL 
MERNA HAS MASTERED THIS OVER A SHORT DISTANCE 
BUT THE JUDGE IS DETERMINED TO MAKE THE TEST AS TOUGH AS POSSIBLE 
KEEP GOING 
KEEP GOING I CAN'T 
SHE CAN'T RUN ANY MORE 
CALL YOUR DOG TIZZY COME 
TIZZY WOO GO DOWN 
TIZZY TIZZY COME 
COME TIZZY COME 
OH UP 
TIZZY COME 
GOOD GIRL 
CAME BACK IN THE END I THOUGHT HE'D OFF ROUND THE CORNER 
OUT OF TEN SIX 
TIME TO FIND OUT IF TIZZY REALLY IS A LOST CAUSE 
SO MERNA I THOUGHT YOU DID WELL 
YOU DID A GOOD FORWARD ROLL ON AGILITY 
OUT OF TOTAL MARKS OF ONE HUNDRED MERNA 
YOU GOT NINETY ONE HEY WELL DONE THANK YOU 
MERNA HAS BECOME MIC'S HIGHEST SCORING PUPIL EVER GOOD GIRL 
AND WITH TIZZY FREE FROM DEATH ROW IT SEEMS THE HEADMISTRESS 
AND THE DOG TRAINER HAVE A NEW FOUND RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER 
WHAT I'VE MANAGED TO DO WITH MIC MARTIN IS TURN HIM 
INTO A SWEET LITTLE BOY WHO COMES AND KISSES ME LIKE THAT 
I LIKE HER 
I'VE LURED HIM IN AND CHANGED HIM 
I'VE MASTERED THE DOG AND I'VE MASTERED HIM TWO IN ONE 
SOMEONE SUGGESTED JUST NOW THAT I'VE MET MY MATCH WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YEAH RIGHT 
LAST TO MEET THE JUDGE IS GEORGE AND HIS OWNER JONATHON 
THEIR TEST WILL TAKE PLACE IN A REAL LIFE SITUATION 
VERY BUSY LOTS OF DOGS LOTS OF PEOPLE 
THIS WILL EITHER GO REALLY WELL OR REALLY BADLY 
LESS THAN A WEEK AGO THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE 
GEORGE DIDN'T LIKE STRANGERS AND WAS GUILTY OF GBH ON FELLOW DOGS 
NOW HE FACES HIS TOUGHEST CHALLENGE 
JONATHON MUST WALK GEORGE THROUGH A MILE LONG PEDESTRIAN ZONE 
TAKE YOUR TIME WE'LL LET YOU GO AHEAD 
JUST WALKED STRAIGHT PAST A GOLDEN RETRIEVER AND HE DIDN'T REACT AT ALL THAT'S FANTASTIC 
REALLY REALLY PLEASED WITH THAT 
THIS IS ALMOST AS INTENSE AS IT'S EVER GOING TO GET 
AND THIS IS REALLY TESTING HIM TO THE LIMIT 
SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHETHER JONATHON COULD COPE WITH THE UNEXPECTED AND THIS IS THE UNEXPECTED 
AFTER SUCH AN IMPRESSIVE DISPLAY THE JUDGE HAS MADE A DECISION THAT NO ONE IS PREPARED FOR 
I KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS THAT YOU FACE IS YOUR DOG OFF THE LEAD AROUND OTHER DOGS 
AND SO I'D LIKE TO TEST YOU ON THAT 
NOW IT'S NOT JUST GEORGE AND JONATHON WHO'LL FACE THE MUSIC 
WE SHALL SEE ONE LITTLE BIT TO GO 
TRAINER LYNNE'S REPUTATION IS ALSO ON THE LINE 
DOG IN 
WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY TRAINED FOR THIS SO IT WILL BE JONATHON 
THINKING ABOUT WHAT HE'S DOING AND JUST DEALING WITH IT 
COME ON 
GEORGIE COME ON 
COME ON 
GEORGIE 
WELL DONE

BACK PAST STAY TO YOUR LEFT 
WALK THIS WAY 
GEORGIE GEORGIE COME ON BOY 
GOOD BOY COME ON COME ON

NOW THE MOMENT OF TRUTH 
WELL DONE LYNNE'S PROBABLY EXPLAINED TO YOU THAT YOU ARE THE CAUSE OF A LOT OF THE BEHAVIOUR 
YOU ARE STILL VERY ANXIOUS AND ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT AS YOU SEE THE DOG IMPROVE

ALL INMATES HAVE GRADUATED WITH DISTINCTION

SHE DOESN'T GET BORED NOW WHEN WE'RE OUT HAVING A WALK BECAUSE I'M MORE INTERESTING 
HER RECALL'S BEEN MUCH BETTER SHE'S JUST A DIFFERENT DOG 
GOOD GIRL 
EVERYONE'S NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE IN HER AND RATHER THAN JUMPING ALL OVER PEOPLE 
SHE'LL SIT IN FRONT OF THEM SHE'S LIKE A DIFFERENT DOG 
I KNOW THAT I'M THE BOSS NOW AND THAT SHE IS THE DOG 
BACK IN MANCHESTER DOES TIZZY HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE 
TIZZY'S BEHAVIOUR HAS CHANGED 
IT'S AS IF I'VE GOT A NEW DOG IN THE SAME BODY 
BECAUSE THE WAY SHE RESPONDS TO ME AND OUR RELATIONSHIP IS A PLEASURE 
BEFORE I WAS CONTEMPLATING HAVING TIZZY PUT TO SLEEP 
NOW OUR LIVES ARE CHANGED COMPLETELY 
WE'VE GOT A WHOLE NEW LIFE AHEAD TOGETHER
