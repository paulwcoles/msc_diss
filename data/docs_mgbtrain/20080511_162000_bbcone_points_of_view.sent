GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO POINTS OF VIEW 
IT'S SORTED EVERYONE 
THE PROBLEM THAT'S HAD CHANNEL CONTROLLERS RIPPING EACH OTHER'S BRACES OFF 
AND WAKING AT NIGHT DRENCHED IN SWEAT HOW DO YOU MAKE YOUR AUDIENCES HAPPY ON A SATURDAY NIGHT 
THAT IS THE BIG ONE AND WE'VE SOLVED IT 
OR AT LEAST YOU HAVE THE ANSWER TURNED OUT TO BE A THREE LETTER WORD 
NOW DELANEY HAD A DONKEY 
THAT EVERYONE ADMIRED 
TEMPORARILY LAZY AND PERMANENTLY TIRED 
A LEG AT EVERY CORNER BALANCING HIS HEAD 
AND A TAIL TO LET YOU KNOW WHICH END 
IT WAS VAL ALL ALONG 
V. A L. THAT'S ALL WE NEEDED 
IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF CASH SAVED THE SUM WE COULD SPEND ON NEW CARPETS 
IF THE BEEB LEFT ANNE ISABELLA MIKERAPHONE WAS IT 
AND PEDROKELLY IN CHARGE OF SATURDAY NIGHTS 
MUSIC STIRS THE SOUL WHERE WERE YOU LOOKING FOR IT THIS WEEK 
WELL THERE WAS YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
THERE WAS MUSIC ON THAT WASN'T THERE 
WHEN I SAW THAT COMMENT I ASSUMED THE DOG BRUSHING REFERENCE 
WAS A BIT OF POETIC LICENCE FROM NEIL THERE BUT 
THERE'S A GOOD BOY 
I DON'T GET INVOLVED IN THE ACTUAL MUSIC AT ALL 
THAT WOULD NOT BE THE RIGHT THING 
BECAUSE I'VE GOT YOU KNOW NO QUALIFICATIONS TO DO THAT 
ALL RIGHT WE'VE GOT THAT COULD YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR PLEASE HAVE SOME MUSIC 
AND ON A SEPARATE HYMN SHEET WHAT IS THE WORD ON LATER LIVE WITH JOOLS HOLLAND 
IT'S NOW ON LATER BUT APPARENTLY NOT LIVE 
CONFUSED MAYBE RICHARD POWELL CAN HELP US 
GOOD QUESTION RICHARD I'LL ASK 
WE WANT EVERYONE TO KEEP WATCHING ON FRIDAY 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE LATER STARTED AND HAS BEEN ON FOR SIXTEEN YEARS 
BUT IF MORE PEOPLE DISCOVER WHAT WE DO 
ON A TUESDAY AT TEN AND GET INTO IT AND THEN JOIN US 
ON FRIDAY AS WELL WHERE THEY WILL GET MORE OF IT THAT'S GOOD FOR EVERYONE I THINK 
SO THERE IS OUR ANSWER THEN NOW IN CASE YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM TEMPORARY AMNESIA LET ME REMIND YOU 
YOU ARE WATCHING B. B. C. ONE AND THIS IS POINTS OF VIEW DID YOU NEED TELLING 
IT SEEMS B. B. C. THREE B. B. C. FOUR CBEEBIES AND MANY OF THE B. B. C.'S OTHER DIGITAL CHANNELS THINK YOU DO 
BECAUSE THEY PUT UP THAT LITTLE ICON KNOWN AS A DOG 
OR DIGITAL ON SCREEN GRAPHIC 
IT'S THERE ALL THE TIME SO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE 
AND WE DON'T MIND DO WE OH YES WE DO 
WHY DO T. V. CHANNELS INSIST ON PUTTING STATIC LOGOS 
ON OUR T. V. SCREENS WHILST WE'RE WATCHING 
THE CHILDREN'S CHANNELS FROM THE B. B. C. ARE PARTICULARLY BRIGHT 
AND EVEN THOUGH PART OF THE LOGO IS ANIMATED THE REST ISN'T 
SO WE JUST GET A STATIC IMAGE BURNT INTO PLASMA T. V.'S 
THE SAME WITH THE B. B. C. BREAKFAST NEWS 
WHY DO I HAVE TO HAVE A CLOCK TELLING ME WHAT THE TIME IS 
I'VE GOT CLOCKS IN MY HOUSE I DON'T NEED IT CONSTANTLY ON THE SCREEN 
MARTIN UPLOADED HIS MOAN VIA OUR WEBSITE WHY NOT GIVE IT A GO 
IT'S VERY EASY BY THE WAY AND WE'LL TRY AND GET YOU AN ANSWER LIKE THIS ONE 
FIRST OF ALL LET'S HEAR WHY THE B. B. C. INSISTS 
ON PUTTING A LOGO SOME VIEWERS FIND IRRITATING AND DISTRACTING ON ITS DIGITAL CHANNELS 
MOST OF US TODAY ARE WATCHING DIGITAL TELEVISION 
AND WITH THAT WE HAVE A VAST CHOICE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF CHANNELS 
THAT WE'RE ABLE TO WATCH THE DOG OR CHANNEL LOGO THAT APPEARS IN THE CORNER 
IS A REALLY HELPFUL TOOL FOR VIEWERS TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT CHANNEL THEY'RE WATCHING 
ALSO AS YOU NAVIGATE AROUND THE CHANNELS YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE 
WE'RE ALWAYS MINDFUL OF WHAT FEEDBACK WE GET FROM OUR VIEWERS 
AND WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY BUT I THINK ON BALANCE 
WE'VE DECIDED THAT THE BENEFIT OF BEING ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE 
WHAT CHANNEL THEY'RE WATCHING TO HELP THEM TO NAVIGATE 
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE DISTRACTION FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
ALTHOUGH AS I SAY WE ARE VERY MINDFUL OF THEIR CONCERNS 
NEXT MARTIN'S COMPLAINT ABOUT SCREEN BURN IN 
NOW THIS HAPPENS WHEN LOGOS REMAIN ON SCREEN FOR LONG PERIODS 
THE LOGO GETS BURNT ONTO THE SCREEN 
IT ONLY AFFECTS BIG PLASMA SCREENS AND THE B. B. C.'S TECHNOLOGISTS ARE TRYING TO COMBAT THE PROBLEM 
WE DO TRY AS FAR AS WE CAN 
TO FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES THAT WE'VE AGREED WITH THE CONSUMER INDUSTRY 
TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF OUR LOGOS SO THAT THEY'RE STILL LEGIBLE 
BUT ARE AT A SENSIBLY LOW LEVEL THAT SHOULD NOT CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH BURN IN 
THERE ARE OTHER TECHNIQUES FOR REDUCING BURN IN YOU CAN MOVE THE LOGO VERY SLIGHTLY 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE VERY MUCH JUST TO BLUR THE EDGES SO YOU DON'T GET A HARD BURN IN 
FOR BUYERS OF NEW PLASMA SCREENS 
A TIP FROM THE TECHIES TO AVOID BURN IN ALMOST COMPLETELY 
WHEN YOU GET IT HOME IT WILL HAVE BEEN SET UP FOR SHOWROOM USE AT ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM BRIGHTNESS 
THE BEST ADVICE IS TO REDUCE THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SCREEN 
TO ABOUT HALF OR SOMETHING AROUND THERE 
TO REDUCE THE RISK OF BURN IN 
THE B. B. C. DEPARTMENT KNOWN AS THE KENNELS WHERE THEY KEEP ALL THOSE DOGS 
THEY'RE HAVING A ROUGH TIME AT THE MOMENT COS THEY DO CREDIT SQUEEZING TOO 
AND WE KNOW HOW FURIOUS THAT MAKES YOU 
SHORTLY WE'LL GO AND SEE THEM UNLEASH THE HOUNDS OF HELL 
FROM CREDIT SQUEEZE A SORT OF B. B. C. INDUCED PROBLEM 
TO CREDIT CRUNCH ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR 
BUT SAYING THAT I'D CHECK MYSELF 
SOME DAYTIME PROGRAMMES DO SEEM TO ENCOURAGE VIEWERS 
TO STRETCH THEIR BUDGET TO INVEST IN PROPERTY AS YOU'VE POINTED OUT 
WEEKDAY MORNINGS ARE THE TRADITIONAL HOME OF B. B. C. ONE'S ENDURINGLY POPULAR PROPERTY PROGRAMMES 
HOMES UNDER THE HAMMER AND TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
IT'S A SUNNY WORLD WHERE PRICES ALWAYS RISE 
MORTGAGES ARE PLENTIFUL AND ONLY A BUFFOON COULD LOSE MONEY 
BUT FORMER PROPERTY DEVELOPER MARK GORDON 
THINKS THE RELENTLESS OPTIMISM OF DAYTIME PROPERTY SHOWS IS WAY OUT OF DATE 
HE SOLD ALL HIS PROPERTIES IN MARCH CONVINCED THE GOOD TIMES ARE OVER 
THE PROGRAMME IS SO IRRELEVANT TO TODAY'S MARKET 
THE FIGURES ARE GONNA STACK UP SOON PEOPLE ARE GONNA COME FOR REMORTGAGE SOON THEY'RE GONNA STRUGGLE 
AND THOSE SORT OF PROGRAMMES ARE BEING SHOWN ON T. V. THAT YOU KNOW 
ARE A CLOUD CUCKOO LAND VERSION OF PROPERTY BUYING I THINK THAT THEY'LL OFFEND THEM 
MAKE SOME PROGRAMMES ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE COS IT'S DONE AND DUSTED REALLY 
THE B. B. C. MAINTAINS ITS DAYTIME PROGRAMMES 
ARE NOW REFLECTING THE SLOWER HOUSING MARKET 
ALL OF OUR PROPERTY PROGRAMMES ARE VERY MUCH A REFLECTION 
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE HOUSING MARKET 
HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALISE 
THAT THIS IS A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE 
ULTIMATELY THESE SHOWS THOUGH HUGELY POPULAR ARE ENTERTAINMENT SHOWS 
THEY DO OFFER GENUINE ADVICE ON THE BASICS OF HOW TO BUY AND SELL A PROPERTY 
WITH REPEATED PROGRAMMES INCREASINGLY WHAT WE'RE DOING 
IS USING ON SCREEN DEVICES VARIOUS TYPES OF DEVICES 
TO CLARIFY THAT PRICES WERE ACCURATE AT THE TIME OF RECORDING 
SOME MOVEMENT IN THE DAYTIME PROPERTY MARKET THEN 
NOW YOU MAY HAVE CAUGHT MY MENTION LAST WEEK OF ONE OF THOSE CAN THAT REALLY BE TRUE MOMENTS 
CBEEBIES IS THE ONLY CHANNEL ON THE B. B. C. POSSIBLY EVEN IN THE WORLD 
WHERE ITS VIEWERS ACTUALLY ENJOY REPEATS 
SO WHAT DO THEY DO THEY DECIDE TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF REPEATS THEY SHOW 
WELL I'VE GOT ANOTHER CAN THAT REALLY BE TRUE MOMENT FOR YOU 
COURTESY OF VIEWER SUE HIBBERD 
LET US KNOW BY THE WAY IF CEEFAX STILL HAS A PLACE IN YOUR DIGITAL WORLD 
NOW FROM TEXT TO CUTE AND CUDDLY FURRY ANIMALS 
WHICH CAN ALWAYS BE RELIED ON TO ELICIT A COLLECTIVE AAH FROM VIEWERS 
B. B. C. TWO THOUGHT THE CUTE AND CUDDLY STEPHEN FRY WOULD BE THE PERFECT PERSON 
TO LEAD US THROUGH SOUTH AMERICA IN SEARCH OF THE SPECTACLED BEAR WERE THEY RIGHT 
HE'S ALSO WITNESSED SOMETHING ELSE WHICH IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY 
THE BEARS MAKING BEDS IN THE TREES 
THE ENDANGERED SPECTACLED BEAR THERE 
WE'D HAVE A LOT MORE ENDANGERED SPECIES ON BRITISH SHORES 
IF MEDIEVAL COOKING EVER CAUGHT ON AGAIN 
CLARISSA DICKSON WRIGHT TOOK B. B. C. FOUR VIEWERS THROUGH THE MENUS ON OFFER IN RICHARD THE SECOND'S ERA 
WHEN SPECIES PROTECTION WAS CLEARLY NOT HIGH ON THE POLITICAL AGENDA 
SO HOW DID HER HISTORIC FARE GO DOWN 
MEDIEVAL ENGLAND IN THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETIES 
RICHARD THE SECOND IS ON THE THRONE 
HE REIGNS AS A DIVINE MONARCH 
AND THE CHURCH DICTATES THE DAILY RITUAL OF LIFE 
BUT ONE CORNER OF THIS DUTIFUL WORLD 
CLAMOURS WITH NOISE DAY IN DAY OUT THE KITCHENS OF RICHARD'S COURT 
OUR TRAVELLING TALKING POINT TOOK A TRIP BACK IN TIME 
WHERE JESTERS AND SERVING WENCHES 
WERE KEEN TO GET STUCK IN TO CLARISSA AND THE KING'S COOKBOOK 
I LIKED THE OLD AND THE NEW MIXED TOGETHER 
WHERE KING RICHARD WAS IN HIS ROOM AND HE WAS LOOKING AT A T. V. SET OF THE PEASANTS OUTSIDE PROTESTING 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS QUITE GOOD 
RICHARD IGNORED THEM AND FAMOUSLY DECLAIMED 
I WILL NOT DISMISS ONE SCULLION FROM MY KITCHEN AT PARLIAMENT'S REQUEST 
FOR ME IT COULD HAVE HAD A FEW MORE PEOPLE IN IT 
AND IF THEY'D HAVE GOT REAL PEOPLE OFF THE STREET IN IT 
IT WOULD'VE BEEN A LOT BETTER WITH THEM SAT THERE EATING THE FOOD THEY WOULD'VE ATE BACK THEN 
I THOUGHT IT WERE GOOD HOW THEY BLENDED THEM BOTH TOGETHER 
AND HOW SHE MADE IT AS IF SHE WAS WORKING THEN AND USED ALL THE RIGHT INGREDIENTS AND STUFF 
I THINK IT SITS WITH THE B. B. C. FOUR MEDIEVAL THEME THAT THEY'VE GOT GOING ON AT THE MOMENT VERY WELL 
I WOULD IMPROVE THE SHOW BY ASKING 
GETTING DOWN TO MAYBE GOING OUT ON THE STREET 
BY GIVING THE PEOPLE OF TODAY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAMPLE THE MEDIEVAL TIMES 
RATHER THAN EXPERTS WHO ARE ALREADY AWARE OF IT 
WE HAD THE PEOPLE ROUND THE TABLE WHO WERE ALL EXPERTS ON MEDIEVAL TIMES 
AND BASICALLY WHAT WAS PUT IN FRONT OF THEM IS WHAT THEY ALREADY KNOW 
THESE VIEWERS LAPPED UP THIS SERVING FROM B. B. C. FOUR 
BUT THOUGHT THAT IT PERHAPS NEEDED TO APPEAL MORE TO US PEASANT FOLK 
A FLAGON OF MEAD ANYONE
