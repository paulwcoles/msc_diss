HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW 
WITH ME CHRISTINE AND MY RUNNING 
MATE THIS EVENING COLIN JACKSON 
ARE YOU ON YOUR MARKS 
I'M ALL SET 
LET'S GET GOING THEN ALSO ON THE 
STARTING LINE TONIGHT A T. V. 
FAVOURITE ALTHOUGH NO LONGER 
YOUNK ONE WE STILL ADMIRE HIS 
BOTTOM BOTTOM AND NOW STARRING IN TEENAGE KICKS 
AND SOME CAN RECALL THEM LIKE THEY 
WERE YESTERDAY THE OFFICIAL RULING 
THAT DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES WAS A 
VICTIM OF DRUNK AND DANGEROUS 
DRIVING HAS MADE IT BAD WEEK FOR 
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS OR SO YOU 
WOULD THINK BUT FOR SOME IT IS A 
LONG LINE OF ESTABLISHMENT COVER 
UPS SO WHY DO SOME CONSPIRACY 
THEORIES JUST REFUSE TO GO AWAY 
KELVIN MACKENZIE REVEALS THAT THE 
TRUTH IS WAY OUT THERE ONE 
THEORY ABOUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES 
WE NEED THEM THEY MAKE GREAT DRAMA 
GREAT GOSSIP AND GREAT FRONT PAGES 
AS A NATION WE SIMPLY DON'T BUY 
WHAT GOVERNMENTS TELL US WHAT 
QUANGOS TELL US WHAT TOWN HALLS 
TELL US WE LOVE GOOD STORY AND 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW SIMPLE 
FACTS TO GET IN THE WAY OF THEM 
THE CONSTANT NEED FOR NEWS THE 
CONSTANT NEED FOR A NEW ANGLE ALSO 
FUELS THESE ALTERNATIVE AND 
SOMETIMES OFF THE WALL EXPLANATIONS 
AND AS PSYCHOLOGISTS WE KNOW THAT 
VERY OFTEN PEOPLE CAN BE SELECTIVE 
IN WHAT THEY COUNT AS EVIDENCE AND 
HOW THEY EVALUATE EVIDENCE BUT BUT DOESN'T THAT LEAVE US WITH A LOT OF 
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS WAS THERE 
REALLY A KILLER ON THAT GRASSY 
KNOLL WHEN J. F. K. GOT SHOT DID MAN 
REALLY WALK ON THE MOON AND IS 
ELVIS REALLY ALIVE AND DOING A 
STINT IN A CHIP SHOP EVERYTHING EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THIS WORLD ISN'T 
RUN BY THE GOVERNMENT 
I DON'T 
THINK THE GENERAL PUBLIC ARE TOLD 
THE ENTIRE TRUTH 
IF YOU CAN PROVE 
IT I'LL BELIEVE A CONSPIRACY 
THEORY 
I THINK PIGEONS ARE TAKING THEORY OVER THE WORLD 
OF COURSE THERE 
COULD BE ANOTHER EXPLANATION IT 
COULD ALL BE TRUE IN SEARCH OF 
THAT TRUTH I'VE COME TO A SECRET 
MEETING AT A TOP SECRET LOCATION 
O. K. I'M MEETING A FEW NOISY BLOKES 
IN ACTON LONDON 
MY MISSION SHOULD I CHOOSE TO 
ACCEPT IT IS TO FIND OUT MORE IF 
I'M HONEST WITH YOU IF SOMEBODY 
SAYS TO ME THEY ARE A CONSPIRACYIST 
THEY ARE A LOONY TUNE 
BUT HISTORY 
IS LITTERED WITH CONSPIRACIES THE 
GUNPOWDER PLOT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE 
COME THROUGH WITH ALTERNATIVE VIEWS 
OF HISTORY ARCHAEOLOGY AND SCIENCE 
AND THEY ARE CONSIDERED WHACKO NO 
THEY ARE NOT 
WHAT IS THE MOST 
UNEXPLAINED THING YOU HAVE COME 
ACROSS IN YOUR LIVES 
ARE WE ALONE 
IN OUR UNIVERSE L. DON'T THINK SO 
I THINK THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO LOOKS 
UPON US AS A LAB RAT 
SO OUR 
CONVERSATION IS BEING WATCHED BY 
AND CONTROLLED BY A HIGHER BEING 
COULD IT BE THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF 
THE B. B. C. PERHAPS NOT SO FACT OR 
FICTION CONSPIRACY THEORY OR HARD 
REALITY ONE OLD FLEET STREET 
NEWSPAPER EDITOR USED TO SAY ABOUT 
ITS REPORTERS' COPY MAKE IT LIVE 
MAKE IT SING MAKE IT UP AND 
THAT'S TRUE AS IF I'M STANDING HERE 
CALVIN LET'S FACE IT CONSPIRACY 
THEORIES MAKE A STORY MORE 
INTERESTING IT IS AS SIMPLE AS 
THAT 
ABSOLUTELY YES THERE THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE ANY 
SUBSTANTIAL TRUTH IN IT BUT JUST A 
SENSE OF YES THAT SOUNDS ABOUT 
RIGHT 
HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT RIGHT CREATING THAT 
IT AESS NOT NORMALLY 
CREATED IN THE U. K. WE'RE TRUTHISTS 
OVER HERE IN AMERICA THERE IS A 
WHACKO RELIGION THEY BELIEVE IN 
ANYTHING HAPPENING IN A WAY WHERE 
THE GOVERNMENT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
IT BUT ACTUALLY AREN'T PREPARED TO 
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT AMERICA IS 
FULL OF IT THERE ARE ENTIRE STATES 
WHO BELIEVE THAT MAN NEVER GOT TO 
THE MOON THAT J. F. K. WAS SHOT BY A 
BLOKE WEARING A GORILLA MASK THEY 
ARE COMPLETELY MAD AND WE THANKS 
TO THE ON LINE WORLD ARE GETTING 
INTO THE GRIP OF IT OURSELVES BUT BUT LET'S FACE IT SOME OF YOUR BIGGEST 
SCOOPS CON CONSPIRACIES LIKE 
FREDDIE STARR'S HAMSTER DID YOU 
COME UP WITH THAT ONE 
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE 
CONSPIRACYISTS THAT IS ACTUALLY 
TRUE AND IF YOU KNEW FREDDIE STARR 
A LOT FUNIER THINGS THAN HAMSTERS 
HAVE GONE DOWN HIM 
IN SHOWBIZ 
THERE ARE CONSPIRACY THEORIES ALL 
OVER THE PLACE MARILYN MONROE AND 
ELVIS ANY FAVOURITES OF YOURS I I DON'T HAVE ANY TRUCK WITH THEM THE 
COLNE COUNCIL CAN'T CONSPIRE TO 
EMPTY MY BINS OR DELIVER MY MAIL 
THIS THEORY THAT SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE 
WORKING TO SLAUGHTER DIANA IT'S 
UNBELIEVABLE UNBELIEVABLE IN YOUR EXPERT TABLOID OPINION DO 
YOU THINK THIS WILL PUT A LID ON 
THE DIANA CONSPIRACY AT THIS POINT 
NO I DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL PUT 
LID ON IT BELIEVE THERE WILL BE 
DOCUMENTRIES SAYING THE DIANA 
CONSPIRACY WAS TRUE FOR A THOUSAND 
AND ONE DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THE 
NEXT TWENTY YEARS WE'VE HAD LORD LUCAN 
SHERGAR AND OTHERS 
I THINK SHE IS 
STILL ALIVE 
HE BELIEVES IN THE 
CONSPIRACY THAT HARDEEP IS A 
COMEDIAN 
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT OUR COMEDIAN FAMILY MEMBERS ON THIS SHOW BUT 
REAL LIFE IS TRUER WHAT WOULD HAVE 
BELIEVED THAT ADRIAN HERE TOPPED 
THE CHARTS WITH A HOUSEWIVES' 
FAVOURITE 
I'VE GOT MYSELF A FAVOURITE WALKING LIVING DOLL 
YES WITH A 
LITTLE HELP FROM SIR CLIFF THE 
YOUNK ONES THEY AND THE YOUNK 
ONES THEY TOPPED THE CHARTS I'M 
SURE THAT A COUPLE OF PINTS MR. 
DOWNED IN MAKING 
THAT TUNE YES YES THAT WAS OUR MAIN INSPIRATION AND AND IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME THAT 
A CLASSIC POPULAR SONG HAS HAD ITS 
ORIGINS IN A PUB AS MYLEEN KLASS 
IS FINDING OUT THIS MUST BE ONE OF 
THE MOST FAMOUS PUBS IN LONDON 
OUTSIDE OF THE QUEEN VIC IT HAS 
BEEN IMMORTALISED IN A SONG 
HALF 
A POUND OF TUPPENY RICE 
HALF A POUND OF TREACLE 
NUMBER S. THE WAY THE MONEY GOES 
POP GOES THE WEASLE 
WHY IS THIS SO POPULAR 
IT CAME 
TOGETHER WITH A TUNE AND A STORY 
AND CHILDREN LOVE DOING THAT POP 
AND THAT'S WHY IT HAS ONE VIVED AND 
OTHERS HAVEN'T 
SURVIVED LONDON 
AUTHOR CHRIS ROBERTS IS TAKING ME 
ON THE HISTORY OF THIS SONG IT IT COMES FROM MUSIC HALL THEATRES AND 
THIS WOULD BE A NIGHT OUT A 
RELEASE TO GO TO A MUSIC HALL AND 
SEE A VARIETY OF ACTS AND LIVE A 
LITTLE 
UP AND DOWN THE CITY ROAD LITTLE IN AND OUT THE EAGLE 
THIS EAGLE 
TAVERN IS REFERENCE IN THE RHYME 
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING REALLY MAD 
USED TO LIVE OPPOSITE THE THE EAGLE 
AND I JUST KNEW IT AS THE PUB AND AND GOING BACK TO THE NURSERY RHYME 
ABOUT SPENDING MONEY THAT'S GOING 
TO THE MUSIC HALL 
BUT I STILL 
DON'T KNOW WHY THE WEASLE IS 
POPPING THE ANSWER MAY LIE IN THIS 
AREA OF EAST LONDON THIS IS 
SPITALFIELDS AND TODAY IT IS A VERY 
CHICK ADDRESS BUT IT USED TO BE 
VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE WERE CROWDED 
TOGETHER IN THE STREETS IN SQUALID 
CONDITIONS THEY SPENT THEIR MONEY 
ON FOOD THE RICE AND TREACLE OF 
THE SONG BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT 
WEASLE 
IT STARTED WITH CLOTHING WEASLE AND THE HUGE KNOWS THE HUGE 
KNOWS THE FRENCH WEAVERS AND THEY 
LEFT AND THE JEWISH PEOPLE TOOK UP 
THE CLOTH TRADE AND THE BENGALIS 
LATER SO YOU HAVE THIS STRANGE 
MIGRANT AREA WHERE PEOPLE TAKE UP 
THE SAME TRADE IT'S NICE 
AND WHAT 
ABOUT THIS WEASLE 
IT'S PART OF THE 
WEAVING MACHINE THAT COUNTS THE 
YARN AND THE POPPING IS THE END OF 
THE PROCESS IT GETS TO THE END OF 
A CYCLE AND IT POPS 
UP AND DOWN 
THE CITY ROAD IN AND OUT OF THE 
EAGLE EAGLE THAT'S THE WAY THE MONEY GOES 
POP GOES THE WEASLE 
HALF A POUND OF TWO P. RICE 
HALF A POUND OF TREACLE 
MIX IT UP AND MAKE IT NICE HOP 
GOES TO WEASLE NUMBER 
BUT THERE IS 
ANOTHER THEORY WHEN YOU WERE A BIT 
STRAPPED AT THE END OF THE WEEK YOU 
WENT TO THE LOCAL PAWN SHOP AND 
POPPED SOMETHING WHAT WOULD YOU 
POP 
I NICE COAT OR ANYTHING POP REALLY AND WEASLE AND STOAT IS 
RHYMING SLANG FOR COAT SO POP 
GOES THE WEASLE YOU COULD BE 
PAWNING YOUR COAT AT THE LOCAL 
PAWNBROKERS 
AND WHERE DOES THE PAWNBROKERS LANGUAGE COME FROM 
IT WAS A STREET 
LANGUAGE THAT PEOPLE LOVED BECAUSE 
IT WAS KIND OF A SECRET 
AND THE 
TRUE MEANING OF POP GOES THE WEASLE 
MAY BE LOST BUT WHETHER IT COMES 
FROM PAWN BROKING SHOPS OR WEAVING 
IT HAS LONG HAD A PLACE IN THE 
HEART OF LONDONERS AND IT STILL HAS 
TODAY 
HALF A POUND OF TWO P. RICE TODAY HALF A POUND OF TREACLE THAT'S THE WAY THE MONEY GOES POP GOES THE WEASLE THOSE BUILDERS WERE LOVING IT 
WEREN'T THEY SO ADRIAN TEENAGE 
KICKS ANOTHER SITCOM 
BUT IT IS A 
TRUTHFUL ROAD IT'S BASED ON A SAD 
OLD GIT WHO LOOKS BACK ON HIS YOUTH 
AND IN THE STORY HE'S DIVORCED AND 
PENNILESS AND MOVES IN WITH SOME 
KIDS IN A STUDENT FLAT WHO HAPPEN 
TO BE HIS OWN KIDS AND HE THINKS 
THIS IS NICE I CAN BE A KID 
AGAIN IT IS BASED ON THE THING 
WHEN I DID THAT COMIC RELIEF FAMILY 
ACADEMY THING I WAS IN WITH ALL 
THESE BRIGHT YOUNG PEOPLE AND I 
DELUDED MYSELF THAT I WAS DOWN 
THERE WITH THE KIDS AND THEN I 
HEARD THEM TALKING ABOUT UNCLE ADE 
OH LET'S 
LOOK AT CLIP AND YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THE 
WARS HERE 
I'VE MET THE NEW DOG 
THAT THING OUT THERE EATING THE 
BANISTERS IN 
THAT'S THE NEW FAMILY 
PET YOU ALWAYS WANTED ANOTHER DOG 
AND NOW YOU HAVE ONE 
BUT YOU 
DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE MR. HOLINSON 
MADE YOU BUY HIM BECAUSE HE 
COULDN'T AFFORD THE TRANQUILLISERS 
ANY MORE 
IT IS A BIT MORE MANY 
STREAM 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN STREAM YOU GET OLD YOU CAN'T BE THE 
VANGUARD OF COMEDY ANY MORE YOU 
BECOME MAINSTREAM I'M DISAPPOINTED 
MYSELF 
WHAT IS IT LIKE PLAYING MYSELF MORE OF THE ADULT THAN THE KID I I HAVE THIS PROBLEM AT HOME L. HAVE 
THREE TEENAGE DAUGHTERS AND I 
BEHAVE MORE LIKE A KID THAN THEY DO 
I CERTAINLY ENJOY MORE RADICAL 
MUSIC AND GO TO MORE GIGS THAN THEY 
DO AND THEY NEVER THANK ME THAT I 
INVENTED THIS TYPE OF COMEDY AND 
KEEPING TO ALIVE 
WELL JENNIFER 
SAUNDERS YOUR WIFE IS THERE A 
BATTLE OF WITS BETWEEN YOU IT MUST 
BE CRAZY HAVING PARENTS LIKE YOU 
I'M AFRAID IT IS RATHER BORING 
JENNIFER SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME 
WATCHING FLOG IT AND SOMEBODY HAS 
TO BUY THE TOILET PAPER JENNIFER JENNIFER HAS A BIT OF A DILEMMA TONIGHT 
TEENAGE KICKS IS ON I. T. V. ONE AT NINE HUNDRED THIRTY 
AND STARRING YOU 
LOOK AT THAT 
GORGEOUS BODY 
AND AT THE SAME TIME 
ON B. B. C. ONE THERE IS HER BEST FRIEND 
IN THE VICAR OF DIBLEY 
BUT THAT'S 
A REPEAT YOU DON'T WANT TO WATCH A 
REPEAT 
WHAT WILL SHE WATCH REPEAT NEITHER SHE IS ON STAGE WITH DAWN 
IN CARDIFF TONIGHT 
MY HOME TOWN 
NOW WE KNOW THAT SPORT PROVOKES 
PASSION AND WE'VE SEEN IT WITH THE 
PROTESTS OVER THE TORCH THIS 
WEEKEND AND THEN THAT DODGY 
PENALTY IN FOOTBALL 
IT WASN'T DODGY 
BUT THE RAGE IS NOW AFFECTING 
JUNIOR LEAGUE TEAMS AND THE 
OFFENDERS ARE MUMS AND DADS WE 
CONFRONT THE PARENTS LIVERPOOL 
LEGEND BILL SHACKLY ONCE SAID THAT 
FOOTBALL IS MORE SHANKLEY ONCE 
SAID THAT FOOTBALL IS MORE 
IMPORTANT THAN LIFE OR DEATH AND 
FOOTBALL LIKE THIS IS INFECTIOUS 
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO BE DRAWN 
INTO THE COMPETITION AND MOST OF 
THE PARENTS ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT 
SUPPORTING THEIR CHILDREN BUT ON 
BRITAIN'S TOUCHLINES THERE IS 
TROUBLE BREWING 
ONE OF THE KIDS 
WAS READY FOR A FIGHT 
I DIDN'T 
WANT MY SON TO BE A PART OF IT ON A 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON INCREASINGLY INCREASINGLY OVER ZEALOUS PARENTS ARE VENTING 
THEIR ANGER AT THE REFEREES IF THEY 
THINK A DECISION IS DODGY AND THIS 
IS TURNING THE BEAUTIFUL GAME UGLY 
LEE HAS BEEN REFEREEING MATCHES FOR 
OVER FIVE YEARS BUT LAST SUMMER HE 
GOT MORE THAN AN ANGRY LOOK WHEN HE 
MADE ONE DECISION THAT AN ANGRY 
PARENT DISAGREEED WITH 
WE WERE 
ARRANGING A TOURNAMENT AND ONE 
PARENT WASN'T HAPPY THAT HIS BOY 
HAD BEEN DROPPED HE THOUGHT HIS 
BOY SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE TEAM 
AND THOUGHT HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST 
PLAYERS ON THE TEAM AND WE GOT 
INTO A BIT OF A VERBAL AND HE WENT 
TO HIS CAR AND GOT OUT A BASEBALL 
BAT 
AND CAME BACK L. PUT MY HAND UP AND HE FRACTURED A FINGER AND I 
SPENT FIVE WEEKS OFF WORK UNPAID 
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT HE WENT 
TO COURT AND HAS SPENT FOUR MONTHS 
IN PRISON IT IS NOT JUST PARENTS 
WHO ARE LOSING THEIR COOL AT YOUTH 
MATCHES THE INTERNET IS LITTERED 
WITH KICKABOUTS THAT ARE TURNING 
UGLY A SPECTATOR FILMED THIS AT A 
MATCH OF UNDER EIGHTEENS WHEN BRAWL WAS 
STARTED A RECENT POLL SHOWS THE 
SCALE OF THE PROBLEM ONE IN FIVE 
IN THE SURVEY SAID THEY HAD 
WITNESSED VIOLENCE ONE PARENT SAYS 
THAT THE HIGH STAKES POSED BY THE 
PROFESSIONAL GAME COULD BE THE 
REASON FOR THE PARENTS MISBEHAVING 
IT HAS BECOME A WHOLE ASPIRATIONIAL 
THING BECAUSE YOU HAVE FOOTBALLERS 
EARNING SUCH A LOT OF MONEY A WEEK 
AND WHEN PARENTS WANTED THEIR 
CHILDREN TO BECOME A DOCTOR NOW 
THEY WANT THEM TO BE FOOTBALL 
PLAYERS BECAUSE IT IS WAY MORE 
MONEY AND WAY MORE EXPOSURE COULD COULD THIS AFFECT THE CHILDREN LATER IN 
LIFE 
ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE YOU'RE LIFE GIVING THEM A DISTORTED VIEW ON 
COMPETITION CHILDREN NEED TO LEARN 
ABOUT COMPETITION BUT THEY NEED TO 
LEARN TO THRIVE ON COMPETITION 
RATHER THAN BE FRIGHTENED OF IT 
GENERALY'S CONCERNS ARE SHARED BY 
THE PARENTS I MET 
IF THINGS GET WORSE THEY COULD END 
UP REMOVING THEIR CHILDREN FROM THE 
PITCH 
SOME PARENTS ARE CONSIDERING PITCH TAKING THEIR CHILDREN OUT OF 
FOOTBALL COMPLETELY BECAUSE OF THE 
VERBAL AND PHYSICAL ABUSE THAT THEY 
ARE FACING EVERY WEEK ON THE FIELD 
WE DON'T WANT THEM TO GO THROUGH 
LEARNING THE ABUSIVE SIDE OF 
FOOTBALL WE WANT THEM TO ENJOY IT 
AND BE PART OF GOOD TEAM AND AND IT'S NOT JUST THE PARENTS GIVING UP 
YOUNG OFFICIALS VITAL TO KEEP THE 
GAME GOING ARE LEAVING TOO I'VE I'VE HAD A FEW INSTANCES WHERE YOU GIVE 
A MINOR DECISION AND THE TEAM 
AND IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 
GAME OR A PENALTY OR SOMETHING AND 
THE PARENTS JUST KICK OFF THEY 
TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY L. STOPPED 
REFEREEING IN THE END BECAUSE OF 
THE PARENTS AND THEY CAME ACROSS 
BADLY WITH THE LANGUAGE AND ABUSE 
AND IT WASN'T WORTH THE HASSLE IN 
THE END 
BUT THERE IS HOPE ON THE 
HORIZON THE F. A. HAVE ANNOUNCED A 
FIVE YEAR PLAN BACKED BY MILLIONS 
TO TAKE THE ANGER OUT OF THE GAME 
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EMPLOY CHILD 
WELFARE OFFICERS WHO ARE 
SAFEGUARDING CHILDREN AND MAKING 
SURE CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO PLAY 
FOOTBALL IN A SAFE LEARNING 
ENVIRONMENT I REMEMBER WHEN MY SON 
SAID TO ME HE WANTED TO GET INVOLVE 
IN FOOTBALL AND I WAS A PARENT WHO 
STOOD ON THE TOUCHLINE AND 
OCCASIONALLY OFFERED ENCOURAGEMENT 
AND WHEN I LOOK BACK I'M NOT PROUD 
TO SAY IT BUT SOMETIMES MAYBE I 
WAS TOO INVOLVED IN THE GAME 
WOULD SAY TO PATIENTS THINK STEP 
BACK ENCOURAGE AND MAKE SURE YOU 
DO IT APPROPRIATELY RATHER THAN 
AGGRESSIVELY 
AND EVEN THOSE AT THE AGGRESSIVELY HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE ESTABLISHMENT 
ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE 
GAME 
IF YOU 
HAVE CHILDREN YOU GAME HAVE TO SHOW THEM RESPECT IN 
WHATEVER IT IS IN LIFE AND IF YOU 
ARE ON A FOOTBALL PITCH OF COURSE 
YOU HAVE TO SHOW RESPECT FOR 
EVERYONE AND IT IS VERY VERY 
IMPORTANT AND IF YOU DON'T START 
WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG THE END RESULT 
WILL BE BAD 
MANY PARENTS THINK A CLEAN UP IS 
LONG OVERDUE AND WITHOUT IT THE 
YOUTH GAME COULD BE FACING 
RELEGATION 
WELL 
THE KIDS WILL BE RELEGATION THE ONES THAT SUFFER IN THE END 
BECAUSE NO ONE WILL WANT TO BRING A 
CHILD TO A GAME TO PLAY IF IT'S 
BAD AND FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO GET 
INVOLVED THEY'LL BE NOTHING THERE 
DO YOU THINK THESE PARENTS ARE 
LIVING THEIR SPORTING DREAMS 
THROUGH THEIR CHILDREN 
I THINK 
THERE IS A PERCENTAGE OF PARENTS 
OUT THERE WHO WOULD ADMIT THEY ARE 
PUSHY AND IF THERE IS TALENT OUT 
THERE THEY CAN NURTURE IT BUT 
SOME GO OVER BOARD BUT THERE ARE 
MORE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE NOW 
AND A LOT OF PARENTS SAY I WISH I 
HAD THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND LIVE 
THEIR DREAM THROUGH THEIR CHILD 
BUT THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT 
TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE CHILD 
BECAUSE IT CAN MAKE THE CHILDREN 
BORED WITH IT 
IT MUST BE 
IMPOSSIBLE I USED TO SHOUT FROM 
THE SIDE RUN LIKE THE WIND 
MAKE A HERCULEAN EFFORT 
WOULD YOU 
AND JENNIFER WANT TO PUSH THEM INTO 
SHOWBIZ 
NO NOT AT ALL IN FACT SHOWBIZ THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM TO GO THAT 
WAY WELL ONE IS A SINGER AND THE 
OTHER ISN'T DOING VERY MUCH YOU YOU NEED TO BE A BIT PUNISHY 
DO THINK 
I SHOULD PUSH MORE L. HAVEN'T SENT 
THEM TO SCHOOL YET 
WERE YOUR 
PARENTS QUITE PUSHY WITH YOU NO NO IN ATHLETICS IT IS SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE 
THIS AGGRESSION AS YOU DO WITH A 
LOT MORE CONTACT SPORTS 
BUT DID 
THEY SEE YOU COULD RUN QUITE WELL 
WHEN YOU WERE SMALL AND MADE YOU 
RUN ALL THE TIME COLIN RUN TO 
THE SHOP AND WE MEAN RUN 
NO I 
WASN'T ALL THAT GOOD WHEN I WAS 
YOUNG 
DO YOU HAVE A DOG L. L. DO YOU YOUNG YOU WILL KNOW THEN THAT OF COURSE 
DOGS ARE A MAN'S BEST FRIEND THEY THEY ARE ARE THINK OF JOHN NOAKES AND SHEP AND 
ROBBIE AND WELLARD 
AND WHAT ABOUT BERNIE WINTERS AND 
SCHNORBITZ YES SUCCESSFUL 
PAIRING IS ALWAYS VITAL 
BUT GET IT 
WRONG AND YOU COULD END UP IN A 
DOGGY MESS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE 
PAIRED UP WITH DOG MATCHER IN 
COUNTY DOWN WITH ELY HARRISON AND 
A PENSIONER WHO IS IN NEED OF A NEW 
POOCH POOCH MEET KEITH MATTHEWS HE IS A DOG 
TRAINER ON MISSION 
HE HAS WORKED WITH THOUSANDS OF 
DOGS AND THEIR OWNERS HE MAINTAINS 
THAT GOOD DOG OWNERSHIP STARTS LONG 
BEFORE 
YOU EVEN GET YOUR PET WHEN WHEN YOU ARE CONSIDERING GETTING A DOG 
IT IS JUST LIKE SAY SHOULD WE 
START A FAMILY IT A IT IS A 
FULL TIME COMMITMENT AND YOU HAVE 
TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU WORK AND GO 
ON HOLIDAY IT IS A LIFE LONG 
RESPONSIBILITY 
KEITH BELIEVES RESPONSIBILITY PEOPLE NEED TO THINK CAREFULLY WHEN 
PICKING A JOB 
IF PEOPLE DON'T DO 
THEIR RESEARCH THEY ARE TOTALLY 
IRRESPONSIBLE IT IS A TRAUMATIC 
EXPERIENCE FOR A DOG TO BE RE HOMED 
SO BEFORE YOU PICK A DOG YOU HAVE 
TO ASK YOURSELF CAN I GIVE IT A 
LIFE LONG COMMITMENT 
LAST YEAR 
ALONE THERE WERE OV TEN THOUSAND DOGS 
THAT NEEDED RE HOMING 
MY LAST DOG 
DIED AFTER TEN YEARS L. HAD TWO OF 
THE SAME BREED SPRINGER SPANIELS 
I FIND THEM EXTREMELY AFFECTIONATE 
AND GOOD FAMILY DOGS L. HAVE 
GRANDCHILDREN COMING TO SEE ME 
OFTEN AND I HAVE NO FEAR OF THE DOG 
ONCE THEY MAKE RELATIONS WITH IT 
WHAT SORT OF EXERCISE ROUTINE HAVE 
YOU IN MIND FOR YOUR NEW PUPPY AS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED A DOG HAS TO 
GET OUT TWICE A DAY AND I WALK 
THEM IN THE MORNING AND THE AFTER 
NON AND SOMETIMES BEFORE I GO TO 
BED I WALK THEM AROUND THE BLOCK 
WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST SPANIELS SPANIELS NEED TO BE BUSY AND HYPERAND NEED A 
LOT OF FREE RUNNING EXERCISE TO 
BURN UP THEIR ENERGY WHICH IS WILL 
GET WITH PETE EF PETER AND THEY 
ARE FABULOUS WITH KIDS MOST 
GUNDOGS ARE FABULOUS WITH KIDS AND 
FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I CAN'T SEE 
THERE BEING A PROBLEM WITH PETER 
HAVING A SPANIEL 
TIME TO FIND A 
NEW DOG MOLLY HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO 
THE KENNELS IF SHE HAS THE RIGHT 
PENALTY SHE COULD BE THE DOG FOR 
PETER 
SHE LOOKS LOVELY AH PETER AH DOESN'T SHE FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
PETER IS QUITE QUITE TAKEN WITH 
MOLLY BUT KEITH NEEDS TO ESTABLISH 
IF THEY ARE RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WE 
CHOOSE DOG THAT SUITS PETER'S 
PERSONALITY SO WE WILL DO A BIT OF 
A TEMPERAMENT TEST SO WE WANT A 
DOG THAT IS SLIGHTLY SUBMISSIVE 
BUT VERY RESPONSIVE 
THE FIRST TEST 
HOW MOLLY WILL REACT TO LOUD 
NOISES NOISES THAT'S NO PROBLEM 
WHAT IS NEXT 
WE'RE GOING TO THROW WEE BOTTLE 
LIKE THAT 
SHE SEEMED CURIOUS YES YES MOLLY ISN'T PHASED BY SUDDEN 
DISTRACTIONS 
AND SHE IS SLIGHTLY DISTRACTIONS SUBMISSIVE WHICH IS A GOOD THING 
AND KEITH BRINGS IN BOW HIS DOG 
COULD MOLLY BE TOO SPIRITED AND 
INDEPENDENT FOR PETER 
THAT'S GOOD 
FINALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT TEST 
HOW WILL MOLLY COPE WITH MEETING 
PETER'S GRANDCHILDREN 
BEND TOWN TO 
HER LEVEL 
SHE HAS PASSED ALL THE 
OTHER TESTS WITH FLYING COLOURS 
BUT A BAD REACTION NOW WOULD SPELL 
DISASTER 
IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT DISASTER WHEN YOU BRING A NEW DOG INTO A 
HOME EVEN DOWN TO THE SMALLEST 
CHILD THAT THE DOG FULLY 
UNDERSTANDS THAT IT IS SUBORDINATE 
AND THE HUMANS ARE LEADERS YOU'LL 
NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM 
IT IS TIME TO 
TELL PETER KEITH'S VERDICT HAS 
MOLLY GOT THE RIGHT PERSONALITY 
WHAT IS THE VERDICT 
I THINK SHE'S 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT FOR PETER SHE 
IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED FOR HIM 
SHE IS A RESPONSIVE DOG BUT WITH A 
SLIGHT SUBMISSION WHICH WILL MAKE 
IT EASY FOR PETER TO TRAIN AND 
HANDLE THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY 
TO PETER IS HE TEACHES HER HOW TO 
WALK PROPERLY ON A LEAD AND TAKES 
HER TO OBESE YENS CLASSES SO SO YOU'RE HAPPY 
OBEDIENCE CLASSES 
I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY BUT SHE WILL 
NEED A LITTLE TRAINING 
AH VERY 
NICE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WE HAD 
THREE RESIDENTS OF BATTERSEA DOGS 
HOME LOOKING FOR NEW HOMES AND I'M 
HAPPY TO SAY THAT TWO OF THEM HAVE 
FOUND NEW HOMES 
BUT POOR APACHI A SIX MONTH OLD 
STAFFORDSHIRE BULL TERRIER IS STILL 
WAITING FOR MR. OR MRS. RIGHT TO LAY 
CLAIM TO HIM AH AH 
IT LOOKED A AH AH BIT VICIOUS I THOUGHT L. L. WOULDN'T 
FANCY IT 
NO IT'S A GENTLE AND 
LOVING DOG 
MY DOG IS VERY LIKE ME 
I HAVE A BORDER TERRIER THAT IS 
GETTING QUITE OLD IT'S GOING DEAF 
AND BLIND AND PUTTING ON WEIGHT AND 
CAN'T QUITE MAKE IT TO THE TOILET 
CAN'T QUITE MAKE IT TO THE TOILET WE'RE VERY SIMILAR WE'RE LOOKING 
FOR ALTERNATIVE PETS WITH PROBLEMS 
FOR A NEW SERIES SO IF YOU HAVE A 
GRUMPY GOLDFISH OR A BANK ERS 
BUDGIE OR A TERRIBLE CAT DO TELL 
US THAT'S IT FOR TONIGHT TEENAGE 
KICKS NINE HUNDRED THIRTY TONIGHT AND OUR VERY 
OWN ADRIAN WILL BE BACK ON MONDAY 
HE'S FINISHED PAINTING THE SKIRTING 
BOARD AND HE'LL BE BACK ON THE SOFA 
AND WE'LL BE FINDING OUT WHAT REAL 
LIFE IS LIKE ON THE DEWSBURY MOOR 
ESTATE WHERE SHANNON MATTHEWS LIVED 
SO HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND AND THANK 
YOU TO ALL OUR GUESTS BYE BYE
