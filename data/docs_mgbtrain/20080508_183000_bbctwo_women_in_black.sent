MY NAME IS AMANI ZAIN AND I'M AN ARAB MUSLIM WOMAN FROM YEMEN 
I'VE LIVED IN LONDON MOST OF MY LIFE 
BUT I HAVE TWO CULTURES SITTING VERY COMFORTABLY INSIDE MY HEAD 
WELCOME TO MY EAST WEST STYLE WORLD 
THIS IS MY WESTERN SIDE 
I BUY MOST OF MY CLOTHES FROM THE HIGH STREET 
AND THIS IS MY EASTERN SIDE 
WELCOME TO MY ARAB IDENTITY 
HERE ARE ALL MY ABAYAS AND SHAYLAS 
AN ABAYA'S A LONG BLACK CLOAK 
I'D WEAR IT ON TOP OF MY CLOTHES EVERY TIME I GO OUT IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE SHAYLA IS A HEADSCARF 
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE MASSIVE ISSUES ABOUT WHAT TO WEAR 
I HAVE AN EASTERN SIDE AND I HAVE A WESTERN SIDE SO I GET THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS EASY REALLY 
I WAS BORN IN ADEN IN SOUTH YEMEN 
WE MOVED TO LONDON WHEN I WAS THREE 
NOW I LIVE IN BATTERSEA WITH MY HUSBAND NICK 
HE'S WHITE TALL AND BLOND ABOUT AS DIFFERENT FROM A YEMENI MAN AS YOU CAN GET 
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU ON A JOURNEY 
WE'RE OFF TO YEMEN WHERE YOU'LL MEET THE WOMEN OF MY FAMILY AND STEP INSIDE OUR SECRET WORLD 
HOW DO WE REALLY LIVE IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH OUTSIDERS ASSUME WE ARE ONLY WOMEN IN BLACK 
WE MUSLIM WOMEN NOW MAKE UP TEN PER CENT OF THE POPULATION OF THE ENTIRE WORLD 
SOMETIMES IT FEELS AS IF THE REST OF YOU SEE US AS SHAPELESS BLACK BLOBS 
WHERE YOU'VE SEEN A VEIL BEFORE 
TONIGHT I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT LIES BENEATH 
WE ARE THE WOMEN IN BLACK 
I'M DOING SOMETHING HUNDREDS OF MUSLIM WOMEN DO EVERY DAY AS THEY TRAVEL FROM WEST TO EAST 
I'M HALFWAY HOME AND IT'S TIME FOR MY YEMENI MUSLIM MAKEOVER 
IT'S OFF WITH MY JEANS AND ON WITH THE LONG SKIRT 
I'VE GOT TO SMOOTH MY HAIR CURLY LOCKS ARE A BIG NO NO 
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH SPARKLE IN YEMEN 
ONCE I'VE GOT MY ABAYA AND SHAYLA ON I FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT MY BODY 
I FEEL GREAT FEMININE SENSUAL 
THIS COVERS A MULTITUDE OF SINS SO IF YOU'RE HAVING A FAT DAY IT'S PERFECT 
AND IN MY CASE IT'S REALLY TAKEN CARE OF MY POST FLIGHT HAIR 
ANYONE WOULD LOOK GOOD IN THIS 
I'M GLAD THIS FLIGHT TAKES HOURS 
THE WESTERN PART OF ME IS SLIPPING TO THE BACK OF MY MIND AND MY ARAB SIDE IS REALLY COMING THROUGH 
AFTER NINE HOURS I ARRIVE IN ADEN SOUTH YEMEN AND MY FAMILY ARE WAITING 
THIS IS MY COUSIN BEDOOR 
BEDOOR'S ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS 
SHE SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME THINKING ABOUT APPEARANCE HERS AND OTHER PEOPLE'S 
THIS IS IMAD HI OUR FAMILY DRIVER 
WE'RE AN UPPER MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY BY YEMENI STANDARDS WEALTHY ENOUGH TO HAVE A DRIVER 
BUT YEMEN'S THE POOREST COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
I'LL BE STAYING AT MY UNCLE'S HOUSE BUT I WON'T SEE MUCH OF HIM 
WOMEN AND MEN LIVE SEPARATELY BUT UNDER THE SAME ROOF 
NOW FOR SOME MUSLIM ETIQUETTE 
THROUGH THERE IS THE MEN'S PART OF THE HOUSE NOT BOTHERED ABOUT THAT 
THIS IS THE WOMAN'S PART 
NOW THAT I'M HERE I CAN TAKE MY VEIL OFF 
I WOULDN'T TAKE IT OFF OUTSIDE BECAUSE THERE ARE MEN THERE 
APART FROM WOMEN I CAN ONLY TAKE MY VEIL OFF IN FRONT OF MY HUSBAND AND MALE RELATIONS 
THIS IS MY AUNT HAIA 
THIRTEEN HOURS AGO I WAS BACK IN BATTERSEA NOW I'M IN ANOTHER WORLD 
THIS IS NA'IMAH SHE'S A MAID BUT SHE'S ONE OF THE FAMILY 
SHE'S FANTASTIC NOOR IS A FANTASTIC COOK AND NADINE IS A FRIEND OF BEDOOR'S 
NA'IMAH AND NOOR ARE BOTH FROM SOMALIA YEMEN'S NEIGHBOUR 
WE MAY BE POOR BUT WE OPEN OUR DOORS TO REFUGEES OTHER MUSLIM COUNTRIES REFUSE 
THIS IS WHAT THEY DO WHEN SOMEBODY COMES FROM OVERSEAS 
THEY THROW SWEETS EVERYWHERE 
YOU MAY NOTICE THAT SOME OF THEM ARE WEARING HEADSCARVES THEY NORMALLY WOULDN'T DO THAT TO BE HONEST 
THEY'D WEAR A VEIL OUTSIDE LIKE I DO AND INSIDE THEY WOULDN'T WEAR ANYTHING AT ALL 
BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE AND THERE MAY BE SOME MEN WATCHING THEY'RE STAYING COVERED UP 
EXCEPT FOR MY AUNT HAIA WHO'S ALWAYS BEEN A BIT OF A REBEL 
BUT EVEN SHE COVERS UP WHEN SHE GOES OUTSIDE 
THERE ARE JUST A FEW THINGS I'D LIKE TO CLEAR UP 
I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU MAY THINK THAT MUSLIM WOMEN JUST 
WEAR BLACK CAPES AND BLACK SCARVES BUT EVEN THE BLACK HERE HAS SO MANY DIFFERENT STYLES AND VARIATIONS 
HANDY WHEN YOU'RE SHORT OF CHANGE 
BUTTERFLY 
GYPSY FEVER 
AN ABAYA ALWAYS COMES WITH ITS OWN MATCHING SHAYLA 
I WEAR THE SHAYLA FOR CULTURAL REASONS BECAUSE I WAS BROUGHT UP TO 
I DON'T REALLY MIND IF A LITTLE BIT OF HAIR SHOWS 
BUT THERE ARE SOME WOMEN WHO WEAR THE SHAYLA FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS 
SO THEY MAY WEAR A HEADBAND LIKE THIS UNDERNEATH TO MAKE SURE NO HAIR SHOWS 
SOME PEOPLE WEAR A COLOURED HEADSCARF WHEN THEY GO OUTSIDE 
IT CAN BE THICK IT CAN BE THIN IT CAN EVEN BE SEE THROUGH 
THERE IS ONE MORE I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU 
IT'S TRADITIONAL OUTERWEAR WORN BY OLDER WOMEN 
THERE ARE MORE NIQABS AROUND TOWN THESE DAYS 
THAT'S BECAUSE THE MORE CONSERVATIVE NORTH IS NOW 
INFLUENCING THE TRADITIONALLY LIBERAL SOUTH WHERE I'M FROM 
THE TWO UNITED SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO ONCE THE BRITS HAD LEFT ADEN 
INSIDE THE HOUSE WOMEN RULE THE ROOST 
WE DECIDE WHAT TO SPEND ON THE EVERYDAY RUNNING OF THE HOUSE 
MY FAMILY'S LUCKY WE'RE LANDOWNERS 
MY UNCLE DISTRIBUTES THE RENT AMONGST THE OLDER FAMILY MEMBERS 
THIS IS A WORLD THAT'S CLOSED TO OUTSIDERS BUT THE DOOR'S ALWAYS OPEN TO FEMALE FRIENDS 
SOME HAVE JUST POPPED ROUND FOR BREAKFAST WI'AM WORKS AS A BEAUTICIAN IN ADEN 
MANAR IS A TEACHER 
THEY'VE BOTH BEEN MARRIED FOR ABOUT FOUR FIVE YEARS BUT I'VE NEVER MET THEIR HUSBANDS 
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL WE JUST DON'T SOCIALISE WITH MEN HERE I PROBABLY NEVER WILL MEET THEM 
SEPARATING MEN AND WOMEN BEGAN IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
IT'S MEANT TO KEEP THE WOMEN SEXUALLY PURE 
FEMALE CHASTITY IS CENTRAL TO THE HONOUR OF THE MUSLIM FAMILY 
PURE OR NOT IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IT'S BROUGHT ABOUT A STRONG BOND 
AMONGST THE WOMEN IN MUSLIM HOUSEHOLDS 
WE'RE ABOUT TO GO OUT 
SINCE OUR FACES ARE THE ONLY PARTS OF OUR BODIES THAT WILL BE SEEN 
WE'RE MAKING SURE THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD 
WI'AM AND BEDOOR WANT TO SHOW ME THEIR FAVOURITE PLACE IN ADEN THE NEW SHOPPING MALL 
TIME TO PUT OUR ABAYAS AND SHAYLAS ON AGAIN 
GOING OUT WITHOUT THEM IS A BIT LIKE GOING OUT IN YOUR UNDERWEAR 
THIS IS ADEN MALL 
WESTERN CONSUMERISM HAS ARRIVED IN A SMALL WAY BANG IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWN AND WITH IT JOB OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR WOMEN GOOD NEWS IN A COUNTRY WHERE MOST WOMEN DON'T WORK AND WHEN THEY DO ARE OFTEN UNPAID 
I'VE JUST ASKED WI'AM IF PEOPLE ARE FASHION CONSCIOUS HERE THEY FOLLOW 
FASHION AND SHE LOOKED AT ME LIKE YEAH WHAT DO YOU EXPECT 
THINK WE'RE STUPID OF COURSE WE DO 
SO THAT'S SHUT ME UP 
VERY NICE THIS ONE 
THESE PAIR OF JEANS ARE ONE OF HIS BESTSELLERS 
MY GOD LOOK AT THAT 
BEDOOR LIKES THIS 
OH THAT IS A BIG SELLER AS WELL AND THAT LOOK AT THIS 
PLAIN JEANS AND THEN THEY JUST HAVE TO ADD THE ARAB TOUCH 
BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO GO IN ADEN SINCE IT OPENED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
THIS AIR CONDITIONED MALL HAS BECOME THE PLACE TO HANG OUT 
BUT I GET ENOUGH OF THIS TYPE OF THING BACK IN BRITAIN 
BEDOOR AND WI'AM LOVE THIS MODERN MALL BUT FOR ME IT'S THE 
TRADITIONAL OLD FASHIONED ADEN THAT I LOVE COMING BACK TO 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PARTY AT OUR PLACE A GOOD OLD FASHIONED ADENI KNEES UP 
IT'S THIS THURSDAY JUST DAYS AWAY AND YOU'RE INVITED 
THURSDAY NIGHT IN YEMEN IS EQUIVALENT TO SATURDAY NIGHT IN BRITAIN BUT IT'S A REAL BIG DEAL 
PEOPLE GET REALLY GLAMMED UP IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT GIRLS' NIGHT IN 
FIRST THING I NEED A FANTASTIC DRESS 
FORGET THE MALL THE BEST PLACE TO FIND IT IS IN THE SOUK 
THIS IS COUTURE CULTURE EVERYONE GETS THEIR DRESSES HAND MADE 
BEDOOR IS HELPING ME CHOOSE THE MATERIAL 
THIS ONE'S QUITE NICE SEE LIKE A PINEAPPLE THERE 
BEDOOR DOESN'T LIKE THE BLACK 
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL 
WELL BASICALLY YOU WANNA GO WITH SOMETHING THAT'S HEAVY IT'S WEIGHED DOWN BY ALL THE BLING AND SEQUINS 
THEY'RE BRINGING OUT THE TEA COS THEY KNOW IT'S GONNA BE A WHILE 
AND A CHAIR AS WELL YOU CAN'T SEE THIS HAPPENING IN TOP SHOP CAN YOU 
IT ALWAYS TAKES ME TIME TO GET USED TO THIS 
IT'S SUCH A DIFFERENT WAY OF SHOPPING FROM BACK IN BRITAIN 
I'M GETTING OVERWHELMED BY ALL THESE COLOURS 
O. K. I THINK I'M GONNA GO FOR THE TURQUOISE BEDOOR SAYS THAT THIS COLOUR'S REALLY IN AT THE MOMENT 
JUST LIKE JOHN LEWIS NEVER KNOWINGLY UNDERSOLD 
EVEN THOUGH I'M YEMENI I'M A TOURIST WHEN IT COMES TO HAGGLING 
WE'RE STUCK ON THIRTY THOUSAND RIYALS WHICH IS ABOUT A HUNDRED QUID 
IT IS QUITE EXPENSIVE A HUNDRED QUID 
BUT BEDOOR SAYS SHE BOUGHT ONE LAST YEAR AND IT WAS MORE EXPENSIVE SO I THINK I'M GONNA GET IT 
TO HELL WITH THE MONEY A GIRL'S GOTTA LOOK GOOD I GUESS 
I'VE SPENT A FORTUNE ON THE MATERIAL BUT IT'S ONLY GONNA COST ME TWO POINT FIVE OH TO HAVE MY DRESS MADE 
AS IN MOST COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST THERE'S A SEAMSTRESS ON HAND TO SEW IT 
ASMA'S BEEN MAKING DRESSES FOR MY FAMILY EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER 
I'M GETTING A PARTICULAR TYPE OF DRESS MADE A DIRI WHICH IS AN ADENI SPECIALITY 
ASMA'S WEARING A DIRI THEY'RE ALL THE SAME DESIGN A HOLE FOR 
THE NECKLINE WHICH YOU CAN VARY TWO HOLES FOR THE ARMS NO SLEEVES 
ASMA'S JUST GONNA GIVE US A TWIRL 
AND THEN UNDERNEATH YOU'D WEAR LIKE 
YOU'D BE HARD PUSHED TO FIND THEM ON OXFORD STREET BUT IN ADEN WE LOVE THEM 
WOMEN FEEL FEMININE AND GLAMOROUS AND THEY'RE REALLY COOL AND COMFORTABLE 
THAT'S IT SHE'S GONNA SEND IT OVER WHEN SHE'S READY 
I'LL PAY HER WHEN I SEE HER THERE'S NO NEED TO COME BACK 
IT'S NOT LIKE I NEED A SECOND FITTING OR ANYTHING SO ERM 
NOW I KNOW TWO POINT FIVE OH SOUNDS LIKE PEANUTS BUT IT TAKES ASMA ONLY FIFTEEN MINUTES TO SEW ONE 
IN A GOOD MONTH SHE EARNS THREE THOUSAND RIYALS JUST OVER EIGHT 
TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER MONEY THAT ASMA'S FAMILY EARNS THAT MAKES THEM COMFORTABLE 
IT'S OVER FORTY DEGREES HERE AND INCREDIBLY HUMID 
SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE ARE OBSESSED WITH PERFUMES AND INCENSE 
WE'VE GOT A DO TO GO TO SO WE HAVE TO SMELL REALLY GOOD 
MY AUNT HAIA'S ONE OF THE BEST INCENSE MAKERS IN TOWN 
WE'VE COME TO BUY THE INGREDIENTS SHE NEEDS TO MAKE A BATCH FOR THE PARTY 
THE ONLY REASON AUNT HAIA'S TAKEN HER SCARF OFF 
IS SHE'S KNOWN THE SHOPKEEPER FOR SUCH A LONG TIME 
SHE'S BEEN COMING HERE FOR DECADES 
AND SHE ALSO NEEDS TO SEE WHAT SHE'S BUYING 
ALL THE THINGS AUNT HAIA NEEDS TO MAKE HER INCENSE OR BAKHUR IN ARABIC ARE COMPLETELY NATURAL 
SOME ARE VEGETABLE MATTER LIKE SANDALWOOD 
ROSEWATER 
AND SAFFRON OIL 
GOD I WISH WE HAD SMELL O. VISION 
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL 
AND THEN THERE WERE BITS OF ANIMALS 
CLAM SHELLS 
THEN LUMPS OF MUSK WHICH COMES FROM THE GLAND OF A MALE MUSK DEER 
YES THAT'S RIGHT A DEER 
AND MORE DEER SECRETIONS MUSK OIL AND JEWEL OF MUSK 
THE REASON THEY CALL IT JEWEL OF MUSK IS THAT'S ESSENTIAL IT'S IN THE BAKHUR RECIPE 
OTHER OILS YOU CAN TAKE OR LEAVE BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THIS STUFF IN 
IF YOU THOUGHT DEER GLANDS WERE BAD CHECK THIS OUT 
OH THIS IS REALLY REALLY 
THIS IS REALLY GROSS IT'S BASICALLY ZABAD 
IT COMES FROM A GLAND OF A CAT A VERY RARE ETHIOPIAN CAT 
I CAN'T SAY I BELIEVE YOU 
O. K. 
THE WHOLE SHOP STINKS 
OF CAT POO REALLY I MEAN THAT'S WHAT IT SMELLS LIKE 
AND THERE'S MORE 
WHALE BILE ER AMBERGRIS COMES OUT OF THE INTESTINE OF A SPERM WHALE 
BUT THEY COLLECT IT FROM THE SEASHORE 
IT DOESN'T SMELL GOOD AT ALL 
SO AUNT HAIA'S GOT ALL HER INGREDIENTS TO MAKE HER INCENSE 
AND IT'S COSTING HER FIFTEEN THOUSAND RIYALS WHICH IS JUST UNDER FORTY QUID 
THERE'S NO NEED TO HAGGLE SHE'S BEEN COMING HERE FOR SO LONG IT'S A SET PRICE 
BACK HOME AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT AUNT HAIA'S GONNA TAKE ALL THE BITS OF CLAM DEER CAT 
WHALE AND EVERYTHING ELSE SHE'S BOUGHT IN THE SHOP AND MAKE A LOAD OF WONDERFUL SMELLING INCENSE 
THIS IS REALLY EXCITING FOR ME ACTUALLY COS I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY MAKE IT 
THEY'RE KIND OF GUARDED SECRETS THESE INCENSE RECIPES 
AUNT HAIA GRINDS THE DRY INGREDIENTS THEN SHE ADDS THEM TO LOTS OF MELTED SUGAR 
SHE HEATS UP THE OILS 
IT SMELLS REALLY FRAGRANT SAME AS IT SMELT IN THE SHOP WITH ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL PERFUMES 
UNFORTUNATELY ALL THE INGREDIENTS SMELL JUST LIKE THEY DID IN THE SHOP 
IT REALLY IT'S HORRIBLE 
IT REALLY STINKS IT SMELLS LIKE A DEAD RAT 
I DOUBT IT 
IN GO THE DEER DISCHARGE AND THE WHALE EXCRETION OH 
IT'S REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GONNA SMELL SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL 
MY AUNT HAIA'S THE JO MALONE OF ADEN 
SHE SELLS HER INCENSE TO CUSTOMERS IN BRITAIN SAUDI AND DUBAI 
SHE'S TYPICAL OF MANY YEMENI WOMEN WHO MAY NOT GO OUT TO WORK IN AN OFFICE 
BUT RUN A SMALL BUSINESS FROM HOME 
UNDER ISLAMIC LAW WOMEN KEEP ANY MONEY THEY EARN BUT IT'S THEIR 
HUSBANDS' RESPONSIBILITY TO HOUSE AND CLOTHE THEM 
O. K. 
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN I COULD TRUST AUNT HAIA 
O. K. SO THIS IS AN INCENSE MAKING TURNING POINT BECAUSE NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN 
BY MAGIC IT SMELLS REALLY WONDERFUL AGAIN 
SHE NEVER DOUBTED IT FOR A MINUTE 
AUNT HAIA LINES THE BOWLS WITH THE REMAINING PERFUME OIL AND THEN THREE HOURS AFTER 
WE STARTED THE MIXTURE'S POURED INTO THEM TO SET OVERNIGHT 
WOW 
THAT'S AUNT HAIA'S INCENSE 
IN THE WOMEN'S QUARTERS WE ALL DO THE HOUSEWORK EAT AND EVEN SLEEP TOGETHER 
UNLESS YOU'RE MARRIED IN WHICH CASE YOU'LL BE IN HIS BED 
THIS IS AN OLD FASHIONED WAY OF LIFE FOR YOUNGER MUSLIM WOMEN NOW BUT I LOVE IT 
A LOT OF TIME IS SPENT ON SMELLING AND LOOKING GOOD 
IT'S THE PARTY TOMORROW AND I'VE GOT SO MUCH TO DO THAT I'D BETTER START GETTING READY NOW 
AUNT HAIA'S GOT ANOTHER RECIPE UP HER SLEEVE TAKE ONE PACK OF HENNA 
ADD SOME WATER SHOVE YOUR HAND IN TILL YOU GET A NICE THICK PASTE ADD A DOLLOP OF YOGHURT 
ADD ONE EGG 
AND A SPLASH OF OLIVE OIL 
BAP IT IN ON YOUR HAIR 
LEAVE ON FOR ONE HOUR THAT'S IT 
NO TIME TO LOSE 
WHILE THAT'S SORTING OUT THE HAIR ON MY HEAD I'M GOING TO GET RID OF THE HAIRS ON MY BODY ALL OF THEM 
I REALLY HATE THIS PART BUT WAXING'S A BIG DEAL AMONGST MUSLIM WOMEN 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU'RE ASIAN ARAB OR BRITISH YOU'VE GOTTA GET WAXED 
HAVING ANY HAIR IS A COMPLETE SOCIAL FAUX PAS A BIT LIKE FARTING IN PUBLIC 
WHEN I SAY WAXING IT'S NOT ACTUALLY WAX IT'S SUGARING WHICH IS SUGAR 
LEMON JUICE AND WATER BOILED UP TO LOOK LIKE TOFFEE 
IT'S ALL NATURAL BUT IT'S VERY PAINFUL 
OH GOD 
LOOK AT THAT 
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SHOWING YOU MY HAIRY ARMS 
IT'S NOT JUST MY LEGS AND ARMS THAT ARE GONNA GET WAXED 
THE HOLLYWOOD THAT ALL THE CELEBS ARE DOING AT THE MOMENT 
STARTED IN THE MIDDLE EAST BUT WE DO OUR PRIVATE PARTS IN THE PRIVACY OF OUR OWN HOMES 
THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU YET 
US YEMENIS HAVE GOT A BIT OF A HABIT 
BEDOOR AND I HAVE COME TO ADEN'S QAT SOUK TO GET THE DRUGS IN 
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW QAT IS A PLANT AND IT'S A NATURAL STIMULANT 
AND YOU DON'T SNORT IT OR INJECT IT YOU CHEW IT 
YOU SEE THE MEN WITH BIG BULGES IN THEIR CHEEKS THAT'S QAT 
YEMENIS ARE REAL QAT ADDICTS 
THE AVERAGE INCOME IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THREE HUNDRED A YEAR YET PEOPLE WILL SPEND OVER 
A QUARTER OF IT ON QAT RATHER THAN ON DOCTORS AND EDUCATION 
ALMOST ALL THE MEN CHEW AND NEARLY HALF THE WOMEN THEY ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT 
AND THE BIGGEST QAT NIGHT OF THE WEEK IS TONIGHT THURSDAY NIGHT 
QAT'S A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE 
IT'S LEGAL HERE AND IN BRITAIN BUT IT'S ILLEGAL IN MOST ARAB AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 
AND IN AMERICA IT'S A CLASS A DRUG ALONG WITH HEROIN AND L. S. D. 
IT CAN GIVE YOU INSOMNIA HEART ATTACKS AND CANCER 
BEDOOR'S GETTING HER FIX 
SOME QAT CAN GIVE YOU INSOMNIA BUT THIS ONE IS FINE SO YOU CAN 
HAVE IT AND IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SIDE EFFECTS 
FOUR HUNDRED FOR ONE WHICH IS JUST OVER A QUID 
IT'S NOT FOR ME O. K. NOT FOR ME 
O. K. IT'S NOT FOR BEDOOR 
ONE THING I NEED TO POINT OUT LOTS OF WOMEN HERE CHEW QAT BUT IT'S NOT REALLY COOL TO PUBLICISE IT 
MOST RESPECTABLE MUSLIM WOMEN WOULDN'T BE SEEN DEAD IN A PLACE LIKE THIS 
SO BEDOOR IS WELL COVERED UP 
I'LL TRY THIS SHORT STUMPY QAT BUT FOR THE PARTY I'M GETTING THE ONE WITH THE STEMS 
BECAUSE IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE 
THIS BIT'S GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME 
I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE QAT SOUK TO BUY THE LONG QAT WE NEED 
ONLY WOMEN WITH NO REPUTATION TO LOSE WOULD HANG OUT HERE 
BEDOOR IS GOING TO CHICKEN OUT SO I'VE GOT TO DO THIS ON MY OWN 
BUT SHE'S SHOWN ME HOW TO COVER MY FACE WITH THE VEIL 
A VERY HANDY THING TO DO IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS 
I'M ONLY GOING IN BECAUSE I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT IT'S LIKE IN THERE 
I'M NOT REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE AT THE MOMENT I JUST WANT TO GET THE QAT AND LEAVE 
AS I GO DEEPER INTO THE MARKET I REALISE THAT SOMETHING'S HAPPENING I HADN'T EXPECTED 
I FEEL COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED I HAVE TO GET OUT 
THERE'S LOTS OF JEERING GOING ON LOTS OF KIND OF LIKE RUDE REMARKS 
I'M NOT REALLY COMFORTABLE 
SO I THINK I'M GONNA GO BACK AND GET SOMEBODY TO GET THE QAT FOR ME 
I'M GLAD TO BE OUT OF THERE 
I'M GONNA START CRYING 
O. K. 
IT DOES FEEL REALLY WRONG FOR ME TO GO IN THERE 
BECAUSE WE'RE SO SEGREGATED FROM MEN HERE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M LIKE 
LOOK I'M COVERING MY FACE AND I'M TALKING 
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS AMONGST ALL THESE MEN AND IT JUST FELT REALLY REALLY REALLY WRONG 
I THINK I AM COMING FROM TWO EXTREME CULTURES BEING BROUGHT UP IN BRITAIN 
AND BEING SO PROUD OF BEING AN ARAB AND BEING YEMENI 
YOU DO FEEL SOMETIMES THAT THERE'S A BATTLE INSIDE YOU 
IT SHOULD BE FINE TO GO INTO A QAT SOUK FULL OF MEN 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT YOU KNOW 
BUT THEN THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE ME THINKING THIS IS SO WRONG WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE IT'S HARD IT'S HARD SOMETIMES 
ONLY THREE HOURS TILL THE PARTY AND THERE'S LOADS TO DO 
IMAD BOUGHT THE QAT FOR ME 
US YEMENIS PLACE SO MUCH IMPORTANCE ON IT THAT WE POUR GALLONS OF PRECIOUS WATER ON OUR QAT FIELDS 
EVEN THOUGH THE COUNTRY IS BECOMING DANGEROUSLY DEHYDRATED 
THE INCENSE HAS SET LIKE CHOCOLATE FUDGE 
THE HOT COALS BURN THE INCENSE AND THE FRAGRANCE COMES OUT 
IN THE WEST YOU SMOKE FISH MEAT AND CHEESE HERE WE SMOKE OURSELVES 
I'M GOING TO USE A SCARF TO TRAP ALL THE INCENSE 
THAT SMELLS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY BOILING 
IT'S LIKE BEING IN A SAUNA 
NOW THAT I'M SMELLING WONDERFUL I'VE GOT TO MAKE MYSELF LOOK WONDERFUL TOO 
TO START WITH THAT MEANS HAVING MY HAIR STRAIGHTENED 
MOST YEMENI WOMEN CRAVE STRAIGHT THICK HAIR MY HAIR'S TAKING AGES 
ABOUT FORTY MINUTES TO THE PARTY 
THE MILK HASN'T ARRIVED FOR THE TEA THE CAKE HASN'T ARRIVED 
I'VE GOT TO LAY OUT ALL THE BISCUITS THE PRESSURE'S ON NOW 
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET IT OUT OF THE BOX 
NOW FOR THE MAKE UP IN ADEN IT'S AS OTT AS THE CAKES 
NOT TOO MUCH BEDOOR 
ARAB BRITISH 
I'M SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE 
HOW MUCH MORE MAKE UP 
IT'S FINE IT'S YOU KNOW ADENI 
I HOPE I LOOK LIKE A CLOWN I FEEL LIKE I'M A CLOWN 
FINALLY MY NEW DRESS ARRIVES 
THE GUESTS ARE ABOUT TO COME BUT I HAVEN'T GOT MY JEWELS ON YET 
GOLD IS LIKE THE ARAB WOMAN'S CURRENCY 
MOST OF THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY DON'T HAVE BANK ACCOUNTS THEY HAVE LOTS OF GOLD 
TRADITIONALLY MUSLIM WOMEN MEN TOO HAVE ALWAYS TRUSTED GOLD 
WE BELIEVE IT KEEPS ITS VALUE MORE THAN HARD CURRENCY AND BANK ACCOUNTS 
BEDOOR WANTS ME TO WEAR THIS BUT I AM PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN 
I'M NOT PUTTING ON A GOLD TIARA SORRY SORRY 
READY JUST IN TIME 
OUR GUESTS ARE HERE 
BEFORE YOU START CHEWING QAT YOU HAVE TO LINE YOUR STOMACH 
PREFERABLY WITH SOMETHING LIKE CHOCOLATE CAKE 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE YEMENI TO GET THIS ONE 
YOU HAVE TO KEEP ON DRINKING ALL NIGHT QAT REALLY DEHYDRATES YOU 
NO BOOZE OF COURSE 
YOU CAN SMOKE IF YOU WANT TO 
CIGARETTES OR SHISHA WITH TOBACCO WHICH CAN BE FLAVOURED 
ONCE YOU'VE SETTLED DOWN YOU CAN START TO CHEW 
TO DO THAT YOU PICK UP ONE OF THE STALKS 
AND YOU PICK THE TOP LEAVES CAUSE THEY'RE THE FRESHEST 
ONCE YOU GET A DECENT AMOUNT 
YOU STICK IT IN YOUR CHEEK 
AND YOU SLOWLY BEGIN TO CHEW 
AND ADD AND CHEW AND ADD 
TILL YOU GET A LUMP AS BIG AS THE ONE MY AUNT HAS GOT 
FANTASTIC 
IT MAKES ME FEEL CHILLED BUT BUZZY 
IT'S A BIT LIKE HAVING SIX ESPRESSOS 
OR SOME OF MY NON MUSLIM FRIENDS COMPARE IT TO HAVING A FEW GLASSES OF WINE 
ALL OVER YEMEN PEOPLE ARE DIGGING INTO THEIR QAT 
THAT MEANS THAT MOST OF THE COUNTRY IS ZONED OUT RIGHT NOW MEN AND WOMEN BUT NOT WITH EACH OTHER 
I GUESS IT'S A BIT UNUSUAL IN BRITAIN TO HAVE PARTIES WITH NO MEN BUT I LOVE IT 
IT'S A REALLY GREAT GIRLS' NIGHT IN AND YOU CAN LET YOUR HAIR DOWN 
MY AUNT SAYS SHE CAN RELAX WHEN THERE ARE NO MEN AROUND 
BUT SOMETIMES THEY COME IN USEFUL 
I'M NEAR THE END OF MY TRIP 
I ALWAYS FIND IT HARD TO LEAVE THIS WOMEN'S WORLD 
COULD I LIVE HERE ALL THE TIME 
I DOUBT IT BUT I'D MISS IT IF I DIDN'T VISIT 
YEMEN'S CHANGING SLOWLY COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE WORLD 
IN PUBLIC WOMEN'S LIVES ARE RESTRICTED 
THAT MEANS THAT THIS PRIVATE WORLD IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN EVER 
NEXT WEEK MEET THE DUBAI STYLE MONSTERS 
THIS IS HOT 
THEY'RE IN THERE FLIRTING WITH EACH OTHER AND THEY'RE USING ONE OF THESE 
IT'S OUR BEST SELLER REALLY YES 
THAT WAS SO COOL 
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE DUBAI EYES PLEASE 
JOIN ME IN THE LAS VEGAS OF THE MIDDLE EAST 
TELL ME WHAT TO DO TO GET MY LIFE BACK 
LAST THING I REMEMBER IS THIS MAN WHAT MAN 
THE GUY WITH THE HORN RIMMED GLASSES 
HOW DOES IT END NOT WELL I'M AFRAID
