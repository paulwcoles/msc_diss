THE NEW FOREST IN HAMPSHIRE 
IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PLACES TO WATCH WILDLIFE 
AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THERE IS A PARTICULAR TREAT IN STORE 
BUT TO GET A RINGSIDE SEAT I'VE HAD TO DRESS FOR THE OCCASION 
PRETTY SCARY LOOKING ISN'T IT 
YOU WOULDN'T EXACTLY DRESS LIKE THIS TO POP OUT FOR A BOTTLE OF MILK 
WELL NOT WITHOUT BEING ARRESTED BUT YOU KNOW 
WEARING CAMOUFLAGE CAN GET YOU VIEWS OF BRITISH WILD CREATURES 
THAT YOU COULDN'T GET ANY OTHER WAY ONE IN PARTICULAR LISTEN 
THERE IT IS 
FALLOW DEER 
AUTUMN FROM ABOUT THE MIDDLE TO THE END OF OCTOBER 
IS THE TIME OF THE FALLOW DEER RUT ONE OF THE BEST TIMES TO WATCH THEM 
YOU CAN WATCH FALLOW DEER IN ANY NUMBER OF PARKS AROUND BRITAIN 
ORNAMENTAL COLLECTIONS WHERE THEY'RE USED TO SEEING PEOPLE 
MUCH EASIER TO GET CLOSE TO BUT YOU KNOW WHAT 
DOESN'T COMPARE TO THIS WATCHING THEM IN THE WILD 
THAT'S THE REAL THING 
THE RUT IS THE DEER'S MATING RITUAL 
CULMINATING IN BATTLES BETWEEN THE BIGGEST MALES 
IT'S THAT CLASH OF ANTLERS THAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE 
BUT IT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE GETTING CLOSE ENOUGH IN THE FIRST PLACE 
TO STAND A CHANCE OF GETTING CLOSE TO WILD FALLOW DEER 
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE RIGHT GEAR DARK CLOTHING'S O. K. 
CAMOUFLAGE BETTER COVER UP ANY PALE PATCHES YOUR HANDS YOUR FACE 
AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY 
IF YOU'RE GONNA MOVE YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT QUIETLY 
I'M COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY THEM THERE'S ONE BUCK 
CALLING OVER HERE ANOTHER ONE JUST BACK IN THE WOODS 
ONE MUCH CLOSER OH HERE HE COMES 
HERE HE COMES THAT'S A BIG FELLA 
THAT'S EXACTLY 
THAT PATCH OF GROUND HE'S MOVED ON TO YOU CAN SEE IT'S QUITE BARE 
THAT'S WHERE HE HAS BEEN RUNNING AROUND THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT 
THERE ARE A LOT OF SIMILARITIES 
BETWEEN FALLOW DEER RUTTING AND RED DEER RUTTING 
BUT THERE ARE SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES TOO 
WITH THE RED DEER IT'S A VERY MOVEABLE AFFAIR 
AND THEY CAN RANGE OVER QUITE A BIG PATCH OF LAND 
WITH FALLOW DEER 
BUCKS WILL OFTEN STICK TO A REALLY SMALL PATCH OF GROUND 
IT'S CALLED A RUTTING STAND YOU KNOW IT'S UNCANNY 
THEY SEEM TO MATCH THE AUTUMN COLOURS 
THE ANTLERS ARE THE COLOUR OF TURNING BRACKEN 
THE DARK BROWN NECK 
FULL OF MUSCLE THAT FELLA 
RIGHT SEE IF WE CAN GET IN A BIT CLOSER 
MAKE SURE THE WIND IS IN YOUR FACE BLOWING YOUR SCENT AWAY FROM THEM 
THERE ARE BUCKS COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK EVERYWHERE LITERALLY 
THERE'S ONE JUST BEHIND HIM 
ALL LISTENING TO THE SOUND OF THE MASTER BUCK 
THE ONE WHO'S BEING NOISY AND HAS ALL THE FEMALES WITH HIM 
I GET THE FEELING THIS IS BUILDING UP 
I'M GOING TO COME BACK HERE TOMORROW 
OH 
RIGHT 
BIT OF A WASHOUT THEN 
BUT IN A STRANGE WAY I RATHER LIKE BEING OUT AND ABOUT IN THE RAIN 
ALL A PART OF THE EXPERIENCE OF ENJOYING THE NATURAL WORLD 
ALL THIS RAIN IS ENOUGH TO DAMPEN ANYONE'S ARDOUR THOUGH 
THE DEER AREN'T UP TO MUCH 
I'M GOING TO DRY OFF AND HOPE FOR A BETTER DAY TOMORROW 
THIS IS BETTER 
A CLEAR COLD AUTUMNAL MORNING 
PERFECT CONDITIONS 
AND I'M HOPING THAT THE DROP IN TEMPERATURE 
THAT MASTER BUCK IS HOLDING ON TO ALL THE FEMALES 
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE CALLING 
OH THE DOE'S COMING IN 
THIS COULD MAKE THINGS KICK OFF HERE WE GO 
ANOTHER MUCH BIGGER BUCK COMING IN NOW 
NO QUESTION ABOUT HIS CONFIDENCE 
CALLING THE WHOLE TIME AS WELL 
SIZING EACH OTHER UP WALKING ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER 
THAT PARALLEL WALK 
WE'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE ANTLERS 
THERE WE GO ENGAGED 
THIS IS WHAT THE RUT IS ALL ABOUT 
COMPETITION 
DECIDED IN BATTLES LIKE THIS 
LISTEN TO THAT THE CLASHING OF THOSE ANTLERS 
OOH LOOK AT THE POWER 
YOU REALLY CAN SEE WHY THEY'RE SO FRONT HEAVY NOW 
ALL OF THEIR POWER IN THEIR NECK AND SHOULDERS 
MASTER BUCK IS GOING TO HAVE TO PROVE HIS WORTH NOW 
I THINK IT'S OVER 
YEP THAT'S OUR BOY COMING BACK 
IT'S ABSOLUTE MAGIC THIS IS SUCH A HEADY MIX 
FOR ALL THE SENSES YOU CAN ENJOY IT AT ANY LEVEL 
SURROUNDED BY THE GORGEOUS SMELLS OF AUTUMN THE SOIL THE LEAVES 
THE COLOURS OF COURSE 
IT REALLY DOESN'T GET VERY MUCH BETTER THAN THIS 
A PRIVILEGED VIEW THAT MAKES ALL OF THE WAITING WORTHWHILE 
ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT THEN TO LEAVE IT AS YOU FOUND IT 
QUIETLY CAREFULLY WITHOUT DISTURBING A THING
