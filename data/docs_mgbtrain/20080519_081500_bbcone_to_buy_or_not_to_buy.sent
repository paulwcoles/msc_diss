WELCOME TO TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY WE'RE PUTTING ON OUR THINKING CAPS 
TO HELP A PHYSICS STUDENT MAKE A QUANTUM LEAP INTO PROPERTY OWNING 
HELPED BY THE BANK OF MUM AND DAD 
FINDING THE PERFECT PROPERTY SHOULDN'T CAUSE FRICTION 
DON'T YOU WISH IT WOULD JUST FALL 
RIGHT OUT OF THE SKY 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT IT'S DARK I CAN'T FIND THE LIGHT SWITCH 
WE SHOULD BE TRAVELLING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT TO FIND THREE PROPERTIES 
AND GIVING OUR BUYER THE UNIQUE CHANCE TO TRY BEFORE THEY BUY HE SAID IT NOT ME 
TODAY'S BUYERS ARE RICHARD AND JULIE GOODALL AND THEIR SON SIMON 
SIMON'S BEEN ACCEPTED AT NOTTINGHAM UNIVERSITY FOR A PHYSICS COURSE AND IS PLANNING FOR STUDENT LIFE 
BUT SIMON DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FINDING SUITABLE DIGS 
BECAUSE MUM AND DAD ARE KEEN TO BECOME LANDLORDS 
YOU SEE THEY HAVE TWO MORE CHILDREN ALEX AND STEPHANIE 
AND THEY HOPE THE PROPERTY WILL PASS ON TO THEM WHEN THEY GROW UP 
AND IF THEY DON'T GO TO NOTTINGHAM UNIVERSITY IT'S AN INVESTMENT 
SIMON'S NOT THE ONLY CLEVER CLOGS IN THE FAMILY 
RICHARD JULIE SIMON WELCOME EVERY PARENT SOONER OR LATER SENDS THEIR CHILDREN OFF TO UNIVERSITY 
GREAT WASHING YOUR HANDS OF YOUR CHILDREN FOR FOUR YEARS BUT YOU'RE GETTING INVOLVED IN IT 
IF WE PUT HIM IN UNIVERSITY ACCOMMODATION THAT'S GOING TO COST US TWELVE THOUSAND FOR THE FOUR YEARS 
SO PUT HIM IN A PROPERTY RENT IT OUT TO A COUPLE OF HIS MATES AS WELL 
AT THE END WE SELL IT ON OR KEEP RENTING IT OUT OR WHATEVER AND HOPEFULLY DON'T LOSE TWELVE THOUSAND 
WHOOSH WHO EVENTUALLY HAS THE FINAL SAY ON THE PROPERTY 
MAINE US BUT SIMON'S THE ONE WHO IS GOING TO BE LIVING IN IT 
SIMON WHAT DO YOU WANT I WANT SOME ACCOMMODATION THAT'S CLOSE TO THE UNIVERSITY 
EASY ACCESSIBILITY A BIT OF A GARDEN SOMEWHERE FOR MY MOTORBIKE WHEN I BRING IT UP 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE HIM TO HAVE SOMEWHERE SAFE AND SECURE A NICE NEIGHBOURHOOD 
A PRISON PERHAPS LOCKED UP I'LL HAVE HIM BACK IN SEVEN YEARS 
ALSO SOMEWHERE TO GET BACK FROM THE PUB EASILY MUM I'M SURPRISED YOU SAID THAT AND NOT HIM 
YOU'RE ENCOURAGING HIM NOW WHEN I WAS AT UNIVERSITY MY STUDENT ACCOMMODATION WAS 
IT WASN'T THE CLEANEST OF PLACES OR THE NICEST OF PLACES 
HOW REALISTIC ARE WE BEING IN TERMS OF KEEPING IT CLEAN THE EASIER IT IS THE BETTER 
COVENTRY ISN'T THAT FAR AWAY SO YOUR MUM COULD BRING THE HOOVER 
THIS IS JUST WHAT I THOUGHT ONCE A MONTH HE'S GOING TO SAY MUM WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME UP 
MUMS ARE GREAT THEY STILL DO IT LET'S TALK ABOUT BUDGETS 
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GOT TO SPEND WE WERE LOOKING AT THE BRACKET OF NINETY TO ONE HUNDRED TEN 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ON THE OUTSIDE 
MY PARENTS SENT ME OUT FOR A PINT OF MILK WHEN I CAME BACK THEY'D MOVED YOU ARE A LUCKY BOY 
WE SHOULD GET MOVING WE'LL TRY TO FIND A NICE SELECTION OF PROPERTIES 
SEE YOU LATER ON 
THIS IS A FIRST FOR US PARENTS BUYING THEIR STUDENT SON HIS FIRST ACCOMMODATION 
NEVER HAPPENED IN MY DAY NOR MINE 
IN MY DAY IT WAS A HOUSE SHARE WITH FIFTEEN OTHER PEOPLE TWO TONS OF DIRTY WASHING AND SIX RATS WOW 
YOUR MUM MUST HAVE BEEN BUSY NO THE STUDENT HOUSE SHARE 
I KNOW YOUR MUM'S LOVELY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY GRAND IS NOT A BAD BUDGET 
FANTASTIC BOTH LET'S GO SHOPPING 
NOTTINGHAM IS FAMOUS FOR ITS LEGEND OF ROBIN HOOD AND HIS MERRY MEN 
AND ITS HISTORY OF LACE MAKING 
BUT IT HAS LOTS MORE TO OFFER THAN JUST CHEAP FRILLS 
THE CITY CENTRE HAS A PUB CLUB OR RESTAURANT FOR EVERY NIGHT OF THE YEAR 
SIMON'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE WITH GOOD ACCESSIBILITY FROM BUSES AND TRAMS WHAT MORE DOES HE NEED 
AND LOOK AT THIS MAJESTIC UNIVERSITY BUILT IN ACRES OF PARKLAND 
IF SIMON PASSES HIS EXAMS HE COULD BE IN THERE WITH THIRTY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS 
NO WONDER NEARBY AREAS HAVE BECOME HOTSPOTS FOR RENTED STUDENT ACCOMMODATION 
AN AVERAGE PRICE FOR A STUDENT HOUSE WITH TWO TO THREE BEDROOMS IS NINETY TO ONE FIFTEEN K. 
AND THERE'S QUITE A FEW PROPERTIES ON THE MARKET 
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THEIR BUDGET ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND BUYS ROUND THE COUNTRY 
WELL WHAT ABOUT THIS 
A THREE BEDROOM SEMI DETACHED IN CARLISLE WITH AN L. SHAPED LOUNGE 
WOOD EFFECT LAMINATE FLOORING AND A TASTEFUL KITCHEN 
OR YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS THREE BEDROOM DETACHED BUNGALOW IN A SMALL VILLAGE IN WALES 
IT'S GOT A GENEROUS LOUNGE AND A HUGE GARDEN 
OR YOU MIGHT BE TEMPTED BY THIS EXCEPTIONAL LIVING SPACE 
A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT IN THE CITY CENTRE OF NEWCASTLE 
THE INTERIOR IS CONTEMPORARY WITH A BEDROOM FEATURE FIREPLACE 
THAT WAS AN INTERESTING COLLECTION LET'S SEE WHAT NOTTINGHAM OFFERS 
IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM THAT I'VE LOST MOST OF MY HAIR THE BEST PLAN OF ATTACK IS TO GET ON THE STREETS 
LOOK AT THE PROPERTIES AND THEN CALL THE ESTATE AGENT 
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE RESULTS AS YOU WILL SOON SEE 
HI KRIS SORRY WRONG NUMBER I'M OUT SEARCHING FOR PROPERTIES 
WHEN YOU CAN'T FIND WHAT YOU WANT IT RUBS YOU UP THE WRONG WAY 
IT IS HARD WORK LIKE TRYING TO FIND A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK 
CAN I HAVE MORE NEEDLES PLEASE 
I THINK THIS IS THE PASSAGEWAY IT'S A TAD OVERGROWN 
HAIR LOSS HARDLY WORKED FOR ME 
NO THIS IS SOMEONE'S BACK GARDEN OUT OUT OUT 
MY NAME'S DOMINIC HI I'M DIANE I WANT A HOUSE FOR A STUDENT 
I'M HOUSE HUNTING FOR A STUDENT 
THIS ONE AH I LIKE THAT CLOSE TO THE UNIVERSITY 
MAYBE TWO TO THREE BEDROOMS IT'S STILL GOT TO BE FIRST CLASS NOT SECOND BEST 
THREE LETTABLE ROOMS THREE LETTABLE ROOMS I WOULDN'T MIND VIEWING THAT O. K. 
WHEN DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT NOW 
DO NOT JUDGE US BECAUSE WE ARE SITTING DOWN WE'VE WORKED SO HARD 
LIKE A COUPLE OF HOUND DOGS WELL ONE I'VE CONTRIBUTED A LITTLE BIT 
IN A SMALL WAY I FOUND A SPOT NEAR THE OLDEST PUB IN ENGLAND 
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF STUMBLING ACROSS THAT AND DRINKING SODA WATER AND BLACKCURRANT JUICE 
HARDLY ROCK AND ROLLERS ARE WE IT KEEPS THE MIND FOCUSED AND SHARP 
AND WE'VE DONE QUITE WELL LET'S START OFF WITH MY PROPERTY 
IT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF WORK SOME T. L. C. LIKE KRISTIAN HIMSELF 
BUT THERE IS ROOM TO EXPAND I RECKON THEY'LL LOVE IT 
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH SIZE IS DOM YOUR MAN NO HE'S NOT I'M YOUR CHAP 
I FOUND A PROPERTY THAT IS CRACKING LOADS OF SPACE 
MORE THAN DOMINIC'S AND IT'S VERY SMART AND TIDY 
THIS IS THE ONE I'M BACKING IT HASN'T GOT MORE SPACE JUST MORE BEDROOMS IT'S SMALLER 
MORE BEDROOMS SEE FOR YOURSELF O. K. WILD CARD 
BUT VERY SHREWD INVESTMENT POTENTIAL BUT THE LOCATION WE'LL HAVE TO SEE 
S. NOW WE'LL TAKE YOU ALONG AND OUR HOUSE HUNTERS FINISH OUR RIBENAS 
LET'S START WITH MY PROPERTY NUMBER ONE A TWO BEDROOM END OF TERRACE IN BEESTON 
A MAGNET FOR STUDENTS WITH A LOVELY CONSERVATORY 
ARE YOU ON THEIR WAVELENGTH THEY DID ASK FOR THREE BEDROOMS DON'T WORRY YOURSELF KRISTIAN

RICHARD SIMON JULIE HERE'S THE HOUSE I FOUND 
I BELIEVE IT'S ABSOLUTELY PERFECT FOR A STUDENT

PLEASANT ROOM NICE ISN'T IT IT'S A NICE SQUARE SHAPE 
NOT TOO MANY LITTLE ALCOVES DON'T LIKE THE OLD FIRE CAN'T GO BACK BOILER 
QUITE A LOT OF WORK ISN'T IT 
I DON'T THINK YOU'D TOUCH THE DECORATION FOR THE STUDENTS 
SIMON IS BEING VERY QUIET HERE 
IF MY MUM AND DAD WERE BUYING ME A HOUSE I'D BE OVER THE MOON WHERE DO I SIGN 
UGH YELLOW AND GREEN 
YES OH THAT IS SO YELLOW 
THE UNITS ARE CHANGE THE COLOUR 
I THINK I'D BE HAPPY BUT IT NEEDS SOME PAINT 
NICE SIZE PLENTY OF SPACE 
ALL YOU NEED IS SPACE ENOUGH TO DO THIS KNOW WHAT THAT IS 
OPENING THE FRIDGE NO THE TOASTER THE SANDWICH MAKER 
THE PIZZA CARTON FROM THE DELIVERY 
LOOKS LIKE SOME SORT OF MAKESHIFT FOR THEM TO HAVE THEIR BREAKFAST 
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IT COULD BE 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE USED FOR IRONING I DON'T KNOW NO 
WHEN I WAS A STUDENT I WAS A FREAK BECAUSE YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN ONE 
I IRONED MY CLOTHES YOU IRONED YOUR UNDERPANTS THAT'S WHY YOU WERE A FREAK 
THIS IS A PLEASANT SURPRISE A CONSERVATORY NICE FOR A DINING TABLE 
YOU COULD SIT OUT HERE AND EAT STUDENTS DON'T DINE YOU DON'T DINE ON A LAGER YOU DRINK A LAGER 
AND EAT TOAST YEAH 
A COUPLE OF GARDEN GNOMES 
WHAT DOES HE MEAN NO IDEA NOR ME CAUGHT ANYTHING YET 
A LOT OF WOOD PANELLING ANYWAY 
TWO MINUTES TO RIP IT OFF NO BIG DEAL A STUDENT COULD DO IT 
THIS IS ALL RIGHT A GOOD SIZE IT CERTAINLY IS ISN'T IT IT'S QUITE A BIG ROOM 
I'M NOT TOO KEEN ON THAT WOOD PANELLING 
NO VERY SEVENTIES DO YOU THINK WHEN IT WAS POPULAR 
STUDENT PARTIES HAVE A SEVENTIES THEME 
THAT'S A GOOD SIZE 
OOH YEAH 
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO LEAVE YOUR STUFF ALL OVER THE FLOOR 
JUST CHUCK IT ALL IN LIKE YOU DO AT HOME 
OH THAT WAS A DIG IF EVER I HEARD ONE MUM HAD A POP AT HIM 
IF HE'S GOING TO BE A STUDENT HE HAS TO HAVE STUFF EVERYWHERE 
OH GOODNESS OH RIGHT GOSH 
YEAH WOOD PANELLING AGAIN 
EVERYWHERE IS MATCHING SAME COLOUR NOT PROBABLY OUR TASTE 
DOM AND KRISTIAN SUNBATHING O. I. DO WE LOOK LIKE WE'RE SUNBATHING 
DO WE NO WE'RE IN THE SHADE 
SMALLER THAN THE OTHER ROOM WOULD YOU HAVE FIGHTS 
FIGHTS HE OWNS THE BUILDING HE'D HAVE THE BEST ROOM THEY'RE THE LANDLORDS 
I'LL JUST TAKE A PEEK UP HERE 
OH YES THIS WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY A GREAT STORAGE AREA OR A STUDY AREA 
ALL YOUR TEXTBOOKS ALL YOUR COURSE WORK COMPUTER SPOT ON 
ALL YOUR COLOURING IN BOOKS YEAH 
DECENT ENOUGH BATHROOM ACTUALLY IT'S RELATIVELY NICELY TILED 
A BIT OUT OF DATE I DON'T LIKE IT TOO OLD FASHIONED IT IS OLD FASHIONED I AGREE 
GOOD JOB WE'RE NOT SHOWING THEM IN YOUR WARDROBE YEAH 
HAS IT GOT A SHOWER STUDENTS WILL ONLY USE A SHOWER 
I LIKE STUDENTS THEY LIKE THIS PROGRAMME WE LOVE THEM 
I THINK DOM MADE A VERY GOOD CHOICE WITH ALL THE WOOD PANELLING 
WOOD PANELLING ASIDE WE COULD LOOK AT REMOVING THAT LATER ON O. K. 
WE CAN WRAP THIS UP AND GO HOME WE'VE GOT MORE CONVINCING TO DO YOU'RE SO NEGATIVE 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS HOUSE IT'S SOMEWHERE SIMON IS GOING TO STAY 
THEN YOUR NEXT CHILD IS MOVING IN IT'S ALMOST A BATON EFFECT PASSING IT ON 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S AN INVESTMENT YES 
YOU WANT AS MUCH RETURN AS YOU CAN AND TO RENT OUT THE ROOMS TO HELP PAY FOR THE UPKEEP 
YOU'VE ONLY GOT TWO BEDROOMS NICE STUDY AS WELL 
LET'S FACE FACT STUDENTS DON'T REALLY NEED A LIVING ROOM LIKE THIS 
NO HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING YOU COULD PUT IN A PARTITION WALL HERE 
YOU COULD TURN THIS INTO ANOTHER BEDROOM EVEN A DOUBLE ROOM 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT A LOUNGE THEN BUT THEY DO WANT SOMEWHERE TO CHILL OUT AND OPEN THEIR TAKEAWAYS 
YEAH BUT THIS HOUSE HAS THE BONUS OF THE FULL LENGTH CONSERVATORY 
NO THAT'S A BIG PLUS AND IT'S A LOVELY SIZE ACTUALLY 
PUT THE TELLY OUT THERE AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU WANT AND USE THAT AS YOUR LOUNGE MORE INCOME 
RIGHT SIMON HERE'S MORE OF WHAT COULD BE YOUR LOVELY ESTATE HERE 
CRACKING HOUSE AND A BIT OF GARDEN YEAH 
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED SPEAKING FROM A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE 
UNIVERSITY ISN'T ALL ABOUT ACADEMIA A BIT OF RELAXING DRINKING PARTYING EXACTLY 
TO HAVE A SPACE LIKE THIS FOR BARBECUES AND BEERS SPOT ON YEAH HOWEVER NO ONE'S LIVING HERE NOW 
THE WEEDS AND GRASS ARE GOING CRAZY SO YOU'RE NOT SEEING IT AT ITS BEST 
BUT I CAN'T SEE YOUR BEST HOBBY BEING GARDENING NOT MY KIND OF THING BUT MY DAD ENJOYS IT 
HE ENJOYS IT WELL HE'S GARDENING MUM DOING THE LAUNDRY 
IN TERMS OF YOU WE HAVE THIS INTERESTING ARCHITECTURAL IDIOM 
IT'S PERFECT FOR YOUR BIKE YEAH ACCESS JUST THERE WHIZZ IT IN IT STAYS DRY 
HONESTY IS ALWAYS THE BEST POLICY YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH A HAMMER AND NAIL 
BECAUSE AS WE WALK DOWN HERE THERE'S A VERY INTERESTING ARRANGEMENT FOR THE DECKING 
A FEW NAILS MISSING YEAH YOU CAN DO THAT I CAN YOU CAN DO THAT SIMON YEAH 
ALL WE NEED NOW YOU'VE SEEN THE HOUSE THE GARDEN WE'RE PRICING THE HOUSE COME ON O. K. 
O. K. WE'RE GOING TO GET SERIOUS NOW GUESS THE PRICE 
WE WANT YOU TO INDEPENDENTLY GUESS THE PRICE OF THE PROPERTIES TO WORK OUT WHO'S GOT THE BRAINS 
YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE PROPERTY BUT YOU'RE LIVING IN IT SO I LIKE THAT STYLE 
LET'S HAVE DIVISION RIVALRY PARENTS VERSUS STUDENT SON HAS HE GOT A CHANCE 
NONE NO THEY'VE GOT NO FAITH IN YOU 
DO YOU FEEL YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE I DON'T KNOW 
BE COOL O. K. YOU GUYS GO FIRST 
RIGHT WELL I RECKON IT'S GOING TO BE ROUND A B. O. U. T. ONE OH NINE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
MM YEAH MAYBE SLIGHTLY LESS 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHT ONE HUNDRED SEVEN YEAH ONE HUNDRED SEVEN ONE HUNDRED SEVEN DEAD YEAH 
SIMON WHAT DO YOU THINK I THINK SLIGHTLY LESS AGAIN 
ONE HUNDRED FIVE PERHAPS A BIT UNDER ONE HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
HE'S BEING PRECISE ISN'T HE THAT'S QUITE INTERESTING 
STILL FEEL LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE WON YEP YOU WERE SPOT ON 
I NEED TO SHAKE THIS HAND UNBELIEVABLE 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE INCREDIBLE BEGINNER'S LUCK HE'S THROWN DOWN THE GAUNTLET DOM 
THEY HAVE NO FAITH IN YOU PULL YOUR SOCKS UP WE'RE OFF TO HOUSE NUMBER TWO 
CONGRATULATIONS HE'S ACADEMIC 
IF THIS PROPERTY IS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR RICHARD AND JULIE 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO REMOVE THE GAS FIRE TO CONVERT THE LOUNGE TO A BEDROOM 
TO AVOID ANY RISK OF CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING 
HERE'S MY CHOICE PROPERTY TWO 
A NEWLY DECORATED THREE BEDROOM MID TERRACE IN LENTON ABBEY 
IT'S SO RECENTLY DECORATED THE PAINT IS HARDLY DRY AND ONLY A STONE'S THROW FROM THE UNIVERSITY 
RIGHT HERE WE ARE AT PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
WHICH IS MY CHOICE DOMINIC'S CHOICE HOW MANY BEDROOMS 
TWO TWO SLASH THREE OH THAT'S GREAT 
TWO SLASH THREE MINE IS THREE SLASH FOUR WHICH I THINK IS BETTER A LOT MORE RENTAL POTENTIAL 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS VERY NICE NICE SIZE CAN LITERALLY SEE THE UNIVERSITY DOWN THE ROAD 
LOOKS O. K. I THINK I PREFERRED IT WITH THE SIDE ENTRANCE THAT WE SAW EARLIER O. K. 
I LIKE YOU RICHARD GONE OFF YOU 
JULIE LOOKS NICE AND TIDY THAT'S WHERE I GIVE KRISTIAN CREDIT IT HAS BEEN PRESENTED NICELY 
YOU DO PAY FOR THAT HE SAYS YOU'VE GOT AN EXTRA BEDROOM 
BUT YOU'VE GOT A NEIGHBOUR ON BOTH SIDES YOU'VE GONE FROM SEMI DETACHED TO MID TERRACE 
YOU WANT SOMEWHERE SAFE TO PUT YOUR MOTORBIKE NO PROBLEM THROUGH THE PORCH THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM 
MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T DRIP IN THE HALL CAN I HAVE A WORD ALSO 
YOU LIKED THAT CONSERVATORY NICE 
JUST GO IN AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A SCRAP 
AND NO LOFT CONVERSION JUST GO 
IF YOU'VE GOT IT USE IT YOU AND I ARE GONNA HAVE SERIOUS WORDS 
HE'S A PHYSICS STUDENT YEAH KNOW WHAT THEY CALL THIS NO CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM 
DIDN'T KNOW THAT DID YOU 
STRAIGHT INTO THE KITCHEN NICE QUITE SPACIOUS 
IT'S A LOVELY KITCHEN 
THE LAYOUT IS WHAT THEY WANTED 
OBVIOUSLY JUST BEEN DONE AND NOT USED BY THE LOOK 
IT'S SO NEUTRAL IT'S INOFFENSIVE THERE'S NO COLOUR TO DISLIKE 
A BIG STORAGE LIKE A PANTRY YOU COULD MAKE THAT INTO A BIGGER KITCHEN 
WHAT GOOD IS A BIG KITCHEN TO A STUDENT POINTLESS 
YOU CAN GET HUGE GIANT AMERICAN STYLE PIZZAS DELIVERED YOU CAN OPEN UP EVEN BIGGER LIDS 
YOU LIKE DOING THAT WINDSCREEN WIPER IMPRESSION IT'S A PIZZA CARTON 
NICE BIG SIZED ROOM I THINK YOU CAN SMELL PAINT 
A HOUSE LIKE THIS IN GOOD DECORATIVE ORDER IT TAKES NOTHING TO KEEP IT TO THAT STANDARD 
OCCASIONALLY SLOP SOME PAINT ON BUT MY ONE AT LEAST YOU COULD EXPAND AND BUILD ON IT 
IT'S NICE AND SQUARE ISN'T IT I SMELL PAINT 
I'M SO GLAD SHE LIKES THE SHAPE AND IT'S NOT OCTAGONAL 
THE OLD FIREPLACE AGAIN I THINK THEY'RE ON ABOUT THE FIRE 
NOT MY FAVOURITE THING I'D REPLACE THAT 
OBVIOUSLY A NEW CARPET PLENTY OF SPACE TO SIT AROUND SIT AROUND AND PARTY 
WILL THEY COME OUT TO THE CONSERVATORY NOW THEY HAVEN'T GOT ONE 
IT'S TERRIBLE TO FEEL OVERCONFIDENT A NEW FEELING FOR YOU 
YEAH I'M FEELING VERY CONTENT 
THE SMALLEST OF THE BEDROOMS IT'S A BIT SMALL FOR RENTING OUT 
HE'S THINKING ABOUT HIS MONEY WHAT HE'LL GET BANK OF MUM AND DAD 
EASY THING AGAIN IS IF WE CONVERTED THE LIVING ROOM TO A BEDROOM 
AND JUST USE THIS AS A STOREROOM 
IF THEY RENTED OUT THE LOUNGE YES WHERE WILL THEY WATCH TELLY 
THIS IS A BETTER BEDROOM A NICER SIZE BUT YOU NEED A DESK OR WORK AREA 
BUT IT'S GOT SOME NICE STORAGE SPACE 
LOOK HOW DEEP THAT IS 
NORMALLY A WARDROBE IS SAY DEEP AND IT'S LIKE THAT I PROMISE YOU A BIT LIKE YOUR TRAP 
YOU COULD EVEN POSSIBLY HAVE THE BED HERE 
THEY DIDN'T DO THIS AT YOURS 
HERE WE HAVE THE BATHROOM 
OBVIOUSLY QUITE SMALL BUT LIKE KRISTIAN SAYS IT'S PRESENTED WELL 
BUT MAYBE NOT QUITE AS BIG AS THE PREVIOUS ONE 
THIS BATHROOM IS IN MUCH BETTER DECORATIVE ORDER THAN YOURS IT'S THE SIZE OF A BISCUIT TIN 
THIS IS A GOOD SIZE ROOM YEAH IT'D BE A MAIN ROOM 
THEY HAVEN'T GOT ANY DOUBLE BEDS 
THAT IS SUCH A DEVIOUS LITTLE TRICK WHAT PUTTING IN SINGLE BEDS TO MAKE IT LOOK BIGGER SHE SPOTTED IT 
IT'S ALL CLEAN ALL TIDY ALL PAINTED THE SAME COLOUR 
NOT LIKE THE ONE WE SAW EARLIER 
THE BATHROOM'S A BIT SMALL THE BEDROOMS NOT SO WELL PROPORTIONED 
I THINK WE SHOULD GET IN THERE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT WHAT IS IT 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND MILES PER SECOND 
LOOKING AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE WHAT DO YOU NOTICE 
THERE'S NO CONSERVATORY 
I SO WISH KRISTIAN COULD HEAR THIS 
THERE ISN'T A CONSERVATORY BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT 
WHEN YOU LOOK OVER THERE TWO SKYLIGHTS AND OVER THERE FOUR SKYLIGHTS 
LOOK AT THIS HOUSE THE PITCH IS THE HEIGHT OF THE ROOF 
YOU'VE GOT A HUGE PITCH ON THERE 
YOU NEED A MINIMUM OF TWO METRES TO CONVERT AN ATTIC INTO A ROOM 
YOU COULD DO THAT VERY EASILY AND TURN THAT INTO AN OFFICE OR STUDY 
OR IF THE PRICE WAS RIGHT HAVE A DORMER EXTENSION PUT ON IT 
YOU'D NEED THAT TO MAKE IT BIGGER AND GET A STAIRCASE PUT IN THERE 
BUT THERE IS POTENTIAL WITH THAT PITCH TO GO UP INTO IT 
AND IF YOU USE THAT AS A BEDROOM ANOTHER ROOM COULD BE A STUDY BANG ON IT COULD BE 
SO YOU'VE SEEN THE HOUSE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AREA AND LOCATION 
YOU CAN MAKE AN OBSERVATIONAL ASSESSMENT NOT A BAD NEIGHBOURHOOD 
NO IT LOOKS NICE IT'S QUIET YOU FEEL AT EASE WITH THE AREA 
YEAH AND THE UNIVERSITY'S A STONE'S THROW AWAY 
JUST LURKING BEHIND THOSE TREES I THINK HE'LL LOVE IT HERE 
IT IS A GOOD AREA SO LET'S TALK ABOUT MONEY LET'S DO THAT 
WELL IT'S GUESS THE PRICE 
BUT MUM AND DAD LEFT EATING HUMBLE PIE 
ARE YOU STILL FEELING CONFIDENT NO 
YES DAD IS YOU THINK YOU'LL WIN THIS YES 
SHALL WE THROW THE BALL NOW INTO SIMON'S COURT AND GET HIM TO GUESS FIRST 
YEAH O. K. SIMON PUT THE HEAT ON ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED TEN DEAD ONE HUNDRED TEN DEAD O. K. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
LET'S GO F. O. R. ONE TWELVE FIVE HUNDRED 
CAN I SAY WELL DONE YOU PUSHED THE PRICE UP ABOVE WHAT IT'S WORTH SO YOU'RE WRONG YOU'RE WRONG 
AND HERE'S THE SHOCKING NEWS SIMON YOU ARE SPOT ON AGAIN 
TO THE POUND THE PRICE IS ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND HAS HE BEEN HOUSE HUNTING FOR WEEKS 
HAS HE BEEN ON THE INTERNET I WONDER NOW 
WHILE WE'RE REELING FROM THE SHOCK OF THIS FANTASTIC PROPERTY 
AND SIMON DOING SO WELL 
PROPERTY NUMBER THREE THE WILD CARD THIS WAY YOUR LAST CHANCE TO REGAIN SOME DIGNITY 
BUT IF MY CHOICE GETS THE VOTES FROM RICHARD AND JULIE THEY NEED TO INVESTIGATE RENT LEVELS IN THE AREA 
TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH INCOME THEY'LL GET 
NOW FOR THE WILD CARD THIS THREE BEDROOM SEMI DETACHED IN STAPLEFORD 
PROVIDES ALL THE SPACE A COUPLE OF STUDENTS WOULD NEED IT'S IN A QUIET SETTING 
AND THE PROPERTY HAS A REAL FAMILY FEEL 
HERE IS PROPERTY NUMBER THREE THE JOINT CHOICE THE WILD CARD 
A VERY SMART PROPERTY HOWEVER THE REASON IT'S OUR WILD CARD IS THE LOCATION 
WE'RE IN STAPLEFORD FURTHER AWAY FROM THE UNIVERSITY THAN YOU WOULD LIKE BUT WE COULDN'T RESIST 
STAPLEFORD IS THE EPICENTRE FOR SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVOUR 
ONE OF DOMINIC'S SCIENTIFIC HEROES WHO COMES FROM THIS AREA HERE HAS MADE A LIFE CHANGING INVENTION 
HMM KNOW WHAT IT IS SIMON DON'T HAVE A CLUE 
JULIE SCANNERS IT'S A GUESS BUT IT'S NOT RIGHT RICHARD D. N. A. 
THEY'RE NOT THINKING BIG ENOUGH NO THEY'RE NOT 
IT'S A MODERN DAY EINSTEIN A DARWIN HER NAME IS DOCTOR JOANNE MORGAN 
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT SHE INVENTED 
USING THE FORCES OF GRAVITY AND PHYSICS SHE HAS REINVENTED THE BRA 
SHE CAME UP WITH A MODEL THAT IS STRAPLESS AND BACKLESS SHE IS A BACHELOR BOY'S HERO 
AND SHE CAME FROM STAPLEFORD WILL WONDERS NEVER CEASE DOESN'T THAT INSPIRE YOU YEAH 
IT INSPIRES ME COULD BE YOUR CLAIM TO FAME EXACTLY 
CAN WE FOCUS ON THE PROPERTY NOW O. K. SORRY TO DIVERT YOU DOM BUT YOU GUYS GO IN THERE 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT YEAH YOU GOT EXCITED SHE NEEDS MORE FUNDING 
THINK WHAT SHE COULD DO FOR THE REST OF LINGERIE WONDERS NEVER CEASE 
DOM ALL THAT STUFF IS THAT TRUE ABOUT JOANNE MORGAN YEAH GOSPEL HONESTLY YEAH YEAH 
CROSS YOUR HEART DON'T QUESTION ME SUPPORT ME HERE 
THIS IS NICE ISN'T IT WOW CAN YOU IMAGINE STUDENTS IN HERE 
MIGHT BE TOO NICE FOR STUDENTS 
THEY'VE DONE WELL HERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT ISN'T IT 
THIS DOESN'T FEEL STUDENTY IT'S A NICE SOLID FAMILY HOME 
MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE A CHIMNEY BREAST THEY'VE MADE A SHELF FROM INTERESTING 
THEY SHOULD GET DOCTOR JOANNE MORGAN ROUND 
BIG KIDS HAVING FUN DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE IN THAT POSITION 
NICE KITCHEN IT'S A BIT COMPACT ISN'T IT 
IS THAT A POLITE WAY OF SAYING SMALL AS LONG AS EVERYTHING'S IN THERE ALL THE WHITE GOODS 
THERE'S NOTHING TO MOAN ABOUT 
YOU'VE GOT A SERVING HATCH THERE I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT ON THAT SIDE 
STUDENTS COULD LINE THEIR DRINKS UP 
YOU DO NEED SPACE FOR THE BEER THE WINE AND THE VODKA ESSENTIAL STUDENT ACCESSORIES 
NO IT'S TEQUILA WITH STUDENTS AND CIDER 
THE HALLWAY'S NICE GOOD BANISTER PAINTED UP WELL THAT'S AN ODD OBSERVATION 
NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE 
A BATHROOM 
THIS HAS BEEN DONE OUT REALLY WELL LOOK AT THE LIGHTS IN THE CEILING 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE SOMEONE'S GONE WITH A SHOTGUN THEY'RE PEPPERED 
IT'S NOT A WHITE SUITE BUT IT'S A NEUTRAL COLOUR 
IT'S NOT ONE THAT WOULD PUT PEOPLE OFF TOO MUCH 
STUDENTS CAN MOVE IN AND THEN AT THE END SELL IT BACK ON TO A FAMILY 
THAT'S WHY DAD IS MAKING THOSE COMMENTS THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE 
THIS COULD BE A GOOD PROPERTY SOUND INVESTMENTS 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A CHILD'S BEDROOM A GOOD SIZED BEDROOM SIMON 
FOR A STUDENT IT WOULD LET ALL RIGHT WOULDN'T IT 
THEY'VE GOT TO LOOK FOR RENTAL POTENTIAL 
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A SINGLE BED IN HERE WOULDN'T IT STUDENTS DON'T NEED A DOUBLE BED 
NO IF WE WERE SELLING IT ON YOU COULD QUITE EASILY FIT A DOUBLE BED IN HERE 
THEY SHOULD SAY BUNK BEDS BOTTOM OR TOP WE'LL RENT OUT THE OTHER 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE AND SQUARE 
THEY SAY IT'S HIP TO BE SQUARE IS SQUARE THE NEW BLACK APPARENTLY THINK SO H. M. M. 
THIS IS A NICE BEDROOM THIS MUST BE THE MASTER BEDROOM 
HOW WOULD THIS SUIT YOU YOUR ROOM 
NOT ONLY LILAC WALLS LILAC CARPET 
IT MIGHT BE KRISTIAN'S COLOUR MIGHT NEED TO REDECORATE IT 
EVERY TIME THERE'S A FLAMBOYANT ROOM COLOUR I GET ACCUSED OF IT 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE SMALLER OF THE BEDROOMS 
LET'S BE HONEST KRIS THEY LIKE THE HOUSE 
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY CHOOSE THIS ONE 
IT'S WHETHER THE AREA IS ACCESSIBLE TO NOTTINGHAM WOULD STUDENTS COME THIS FAR OUT 
BUT WE COULD LET IT TO FAMILIES YEAH AND IT WOULD SELL ON PROBABLY EASIER 
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE STAND NO POINT IN SWINGING AROUND LIKE ORANG UTANS LET'S GET IN 
WOULD YOU AGREE THAT OF THE THREE HOUSES THIS ONE IS THE BEST PRESENTED CERTAINLY IT'S LOVELY 
YOU STARTED TO FALL IN LOVE WITH IT BUT I SENSED THAT SIMON DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT ONE 
IF IT WAS FOR OURSELVES THIS WOULD BE THE ONE WE WOULD GO FOR 
BUT IT'S NOT FOR US 
HE'S GOT A ONE TWENTY FIVE C. C. MOTORBIKE WHICH HE'S WORRIED ABOUT 
HE WANTS TO LOOK AFTER IT THIS PATHWAY IS NOT BLATANTLY OBVIOUS BUT IT'S GOT A GARAGE 
YOU CAN'T PUT A CAR IN THERE BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACCESS 
BUT IT'S GOT POWER IT'S GOT LIGHTS 
AND IT'S GOT A DIRTY GREAT BIG SUZUKI MOTORCYCLE IN THERE 
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW PRACTICAL A GARAGE IT IS 
DOES THIS COME WITH IT NO WELL THEY'D PROBABLY THROW IT IN 
RIGHT SIMON COME OUT HERE ALL VERY NICE AGAIN 
MORE MANICURED THAN OTHER GARDENS 
THE SPACE OF THE HOUSE BETTER WORSE 
IT'S A LOT BIGGER THE BEDROOM'S QUITE SMALL BUT THE FEEL TO THE HOUSE IS QUITE BIG 
IT'S STILL A BIT TOO FAR AWAY 
IS THAT YOUR BIG WORRY YEAH O. K. LET'S FOCUS ON THE HOUSE 
AND MAKING IT EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE FIRST THAT MIGHT SWAY YOU 
FIRST HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO PERSUADE YOUR PARENTS TO BUY YOU A HOUSE 
IT WAS MORE OF THEIR OWN IDEA THEY WANTED AN INVESTMENT RATHER THAN SPENDING IT ON SOMEWHERE ELSE 
SO IT'S NOT YOU BEING LOVELY MAKING THEM DINNER 
NO NOT REALLY THEY'RE JUST OFFERING YOU ALL THEIR CASH 
SEE IF YOU CAN GET ANY MORE CASH FROM THEM BECAUSE THIS HAS POTENTIAL TO BE EXTENDED 
LOOK ALONG HERE THIS IS ONE OF THE ONLY HOUSES IN THIS STREET THAT HASN'T BEEN EXTENDED 
YOU CAN GO SINGLE STOREY OR BOTH FOR A LARGER KITCHEN LARGER LOUNGE 
SEPARATING OFF THE DINING ROOM AND LOUNGE AND MAYBE GET A BIGGER BEDROOM UPSTAIRS 
YEAH MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S THE THIRD GUESS THE PRICE TIME YOU'VE DONE SO WELL YEAH 
I THINK YOUR PARENTS ARE AMAZED YEAH OF COURSE THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT 
THERE'S THE PROPERTY DETAILS HAVE A LOOK THANK YOU 
FINISHED I HAVE PASS THEM BACK 
LET'S SEE IF YOU GET IT RIGHT A THIRD TIME 
AS FUTURE LANDLORDS RICHARD AND JULIE HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE PROPERTY IS COVERED 
BY STRICT NEW HOUSING REGULATIONS FOR HOUSES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION 
O. K. IT IS THE LAST GUESS THE PRICE YOU GUYS MUST SORT IT OUT HERE 
SIMON WE CAN'T HAVE A HAT TRICK YOU'RE SHOWING UP YOUR PARENTS 
JULIE HAS THAT LOOK EMBARRASSMENT I THINK 
YOUR BUDGET WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MAXIMUM O. K. 
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT CHEATING YOU GUYS GO FIRST WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE PRICE 
WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AT THE TOP OF OUR BUDGET 
DO YOU RECKON ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN YEAH ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
O. K. AND YOU'RE BEING VERY PRECISE YEAH THEY'VE LEARNT FROM SIMON 
EXACTLY ARE YOU GOING FOR A ROUND NUMBER OR AN ODD NUMBER I'LL STICK WITH THE ODD NUMBERS 
I THINK IT'S JUST OUT OF BUDGET I RECKON PROBABLY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
THAT'S AN ODD FIGURE TO GO TO JUST UNDER TWENTY TWO GRAND 
AND YOU COULD PUT AN OFFER IN AND GET IT DOWN TO YOUR BUDGET 
HIS GUESS IS A BIT ODD 
ROUND FIGURE YEAH FEELING LUCKY CONFIDENT 
I'M HOPING PULLED ONE BACK YES WELL DONE SPOT ON TO THE POUND 
UNBELIEVABLE I DON'T BELIEVE THIS HOW DO YOU 
HE'S A GENIUS HAVE WE BEEN SET UP I THINK SO 
NO WE WOULDN'T DO THAT THAT'S GOT TO BE BEGINNER'S LUCK THREE TIMES THOUGH 
WE NEED A DECISION ABOUT WHICH PROPERTY YOU'D LIKE TO TEST DRIVE TO HELP THAT DECISION 
HERE ARE ALL THREE PROPERTIES TAKE THIS AWAY DELIBERATE 
I'LL GIVE IT TO SIMON HE SEEMS TO HAVE THE BIGGEST BRAIN 
GUIDE YOUR PARENTS BE GENTLE 
WE KNOW HOW IT WORKS COMMISERATIONS BUY THEM A COFFEE CHEERIO OFF YOU GO 
HERE'S A QUICK RECAP ON THE THREE PROPERTIES 
MY CHOICE WAS THIS TWO BED SEMI IN BEESTON 
IT HAS EVERYTHING SIMON COULD WANT A GOOD BEDROOM AND A GOOD SIZED LOUNGE THAT COULD EASILY BE TURNED 
INTO A THIRD BEDROOM TO RENT OUT 
HOLD ON TIGER WHAT ABOUT THIS MID TERRACE IN LENTON ABBEY 
IT HAS THREE BEDROOMS ALREADY AND HAS BEEN SYMPATHETICALLY DECORATED 
WITH SPACE FOR A CONSERVATORY 
HANG ON A SECOND LET'S NOT FORGET THE WILD CARD THIS THREE BED SEMI 
IT HAS ALL THE COMFORTS STUDENTS LEAVE BEHIND AND A DINING ROOM AND FANTASTIC GARDEN 
BUT IT IS FURTHER AWAY 
WILL THAT COUNT AGAINST IT 
WHICH PROPERTY WILL BE THE ANSWER 
PROPERTY NUMBER ONE DECORATION'S O. K. ISN'T IT 
YES JULIE AND IT'S A SQUARE ROOM WHAT DO YOU RECKON TO THE KITCHEN 
NOT KEEN ON THE COLOUR 
THE TILES WILL PUT THEM OFF 
WOULD YOU MAKE IT A DINING ROOM I RECKON YEAH A DINING ROOM 
HOLD YOUR HORSES DIGBY 
I QUITE LIKED THIS PRESENTATION IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE DOM 
THE BATHROOM WAS VERY SMALL SMALL WASN'T IT 
IT'S CURTAINS DOWN FOR YOU DIGBY 
A BIT TOO SMALL ALL THE BEDROOMS 
I SHOWED THEM THREE DECENT SIZED BEDROOMS OH THROW THE TOWEL IN KRISTIAN 
VERY WELL PRESENTED OH THEY SEEM TO LIKE THIS ONE 
NICE DINING AREAS AS WELL GOOD FOR MAKING INTO A BEDROOM 
WOULDN'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING TO IT 
WHICH ONE ARE THEY GOING TO CHOOSE I AM COMPLETELY CONFUSED 
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID KRIS LET ME HELP YOU YOURS IS A NON STARTER 
DOM'S KRISTIAN'S OR WILD CARD 
I AM SO PLEASED THAT YOU CHOSE MY PROPERTY OVER THE OTHER TWO BUT IN PARTICULAR OVER KRISTIAN'S 
IT'S WIPED THAT SMUG SMILE OFF HIS FACE NO IT'S STILL THERE 
UNFORTUNATELY WHAT DID IT FOR YOU I THINK HOW CLOSE IT WAS TO THE UNIVERSITY THAT DID IT 
SIMON WAS HAPPY WITH IT LOCATION YEAH WHAT ABOUT YOU MUM 
IT WASN'T BAD REPAIR 
WE COULD SEE THE IMPROVEMENTS WE COULD DO TO SELL IT ON LATER ON TO IMPROVE THE PROPERTY 
SIMON THE POSITION'S VERY GOOD 
VERY EASY ACCESS FOR THE UNI NICE SIZE 
QUITE A NICE AREA 
I MADE A FUNDAMENTAL MISTAKE IN GIVING YOU LOTS OF BEDROOMS HOW STUPID AM I 
WE'LL HAVE TO MOVE ON CERTAINLY BEFORE WE LET YOU IN 
OUR SURVEYOR GAVE IT THE ONCE OVER ON YOUR BEHALF 
HE HAS FOUND A COUPLE OF THINGS TO DISCUSS 
IT'S NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY IF BUYING GET A FULL STRUCTURAL SURVEY CARRIED OUT 
HOWEVER IF YOU WANT TO CONVERT THAT ATTIC YOU'LL NEED BUILDING REGS 
HE THINKS IT'LL BE NO PROBLEM BUT YOU WILL NEED A FIXED LADDER DOWN FROM THE LOFT 
ENCLOSE THAT PUT A FIRE DOOR AT THE BOTTOM AND HAVE PROVISIONS FOR A FIRE ESCAPE 
THEN TURN IT INTO A BEDROOM 
SOMETHING WHICH MIGHT BE MORE SERIOUS IS IF YOU STAND BACK FROM IT 
AND LINE YOURSELF UP WITH THE GABLE WALL IT'S NOT QUITE VERTICAL 
IT'S ACTUALLY BOWING IN THE CENTRE 
HE BELIEVES HOPEFULLY IT'S JUST ISOLATED SETTLEMENT BUT WE'D RECOMMEND IT GETS LOOKED AT 
THAT'S IT TEST DRIVE TIME 
THEY'RE VERY QUIET DOM I KNOW IT'S THE EFFECT WE HAVE ON PEOPLE 
I EXPECT TUMBLEWEED NOW I'LL GET SOME FOR YOU 
GO AND MAKE SOME NOISE IN THE HOUSE AND WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER ON 
ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO CHECK OUT THE AREA 
HERE'S SIMON'S BUDDIES TO HELP OUT WITH THE TEST DRIVE ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT WILL ENSUE 
YOU KNOW KRIS I DO PREDICT A RIOT I HOPE THE FOUNDATIONS CAN COPE 
WHAT ON EARTH ARE THEY UP TO 
I COULD GET USED TO THIS RICHARD'S WARMING TO STUDENT LIFE 
THEY DON'T NEED AN EXTRA BEDROOM HE'S FOUND A SPOT ON THE FLOOR 
IT'S O. K. ISN'T IT AS AREAS GO 
I DON'T LIKE THIS IT'S SCARING ME OH BEHAVE 
THERE WON'T BE MUCH HOUSE TO BUY 
KRISTIAN BOYS WILL BE BOYS IT IS A PERFECT STUDENT HOUSE 
AND IT SEEMS THIS PROPERTY HAS MADE A SPLASH WILL OUR BUYERS SPLASH OUT 
I HAVE TO SAY IT'S BEEN EMOTIONAL I'M DRAINED I'VE BARELY GOT ANYTHING LEFT TO GIVE 
BUT WE'RE AT THE FINAL HURDLE 
ARE YOU STILL KEEN ON IT YES YOU LIKE IT YES NICE PROPERTY 
IT'S O. K. SIMON DO YOU THINK YOU COULD ENJOY LIVING IN IT 
I THINK I COULD EASILY ENJOY A COUPLE OF YEARS HERE 
YEAH YOU'D LOOK AFTER IT WELL 
HE'S GOT TO BE CAREFUL WHAT HE SAYS NO ONE'S COMMITTING COMPLETELY SEE IT WHEN IF HE'S LIVED HERE 
LET'S GET DOWN TO THE MEAT OF THE BONE HERE'S WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW WILL YOU BARTER OR SCARPER 
WELL I THINK WE MIGHT DO A BIT MORE INVESTIGATION INTO THE AREA FIRST BUT MAY PUT IN AN OFFER 
VERY PLEASED TO HEAR IT HOW DO YOU FEEL SIMON QUITE HAPPY HAPPY TO LIVE HERE
