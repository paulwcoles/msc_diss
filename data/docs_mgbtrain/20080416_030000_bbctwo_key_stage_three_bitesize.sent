HELLO AND WELCOME TO KEY STAGE THREE BITESIZE MATHS REVISION 
THE SERIES DESIGNED 
TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR NATIONAL TEST IN THE SUMMER 
IN THIS PROGRAMME WE'LL LOOK AT KEY AREAS OF MATHS 
FOR YOU TO REVISE WITH A SERIES OF SAMPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO TRY 
JUST WORK THROUGH THE PROGRAMME IN BITE SIZE CHUCKS 
CONCENTRATING ON THOSE AREAS 
THAT YOU THINK YOU NEED THE MOST HELP WITH 
THIS PROGRAMME HAS UNITS COVERING 
NUMBER GRAPH WORK 
HANDLING DATA AND PROBABILITY 
FIRST LET'S LOOK AT NUMBER TOPICS 
THIS SECTION ON NUMBER IS SPLIT INTO TWO UNITS 
ONE ON POWERS ROOTS AND INDEX NOTATION 
AND THE OTHER ON RATIO 
LET'S START WITH POWERS ROOTS AND INDEX NOTATION 
FIRST SOME DEFINITIONS 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS 
EVENING MEET OUR DOOR CONTROL OPERATIVES 
ROCK AND CLIFF SAY HELLO BOYS' 
EVENIN' 
OH YEAH AND THEY'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU TO NUMBERS NIGHTCLUB 
THEY'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU 
BUT THEY WON'T IF YOU'RE THE WRONG SORT OF NUMBER 
IF THEY RECKON YOU'RE THE WRONG SORT 
THEN YOU'LL BE OUT FASTER THAN YOU CAN SAY MULTIPLICATION 
NUMBERS NIGHTCLUB HAS A VERY STRICT DOOR POLICY SEE 
LIKE ON SATURDAYS FOR INSTANCE 
SATURDAY IS SQUARES NIGHT 
AND WE AIN'T TALKING ABOUT THE MUSIC NEITHER 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SORT OF NUMBERS WE ALLOW IN 
ROCK AND CLIFF LET IN FOURS NO PROBLEM 
AND SIXTEENS 
IF YOU'RE A NINE YOU'LL SAIL THROUGH AN ALL 
AS FOR TWENTY FIVES WELCOME 
HELLO WHAT'S THIS AN EIGHT 
SORRY NOT TONIGHT RULES ARE RULES SEE 
SO HAVE YOU WORKED OUT WHAT SORT OF NUMBERS GET IN ON SQUARES NIGHT 
SQUARE NUMBERS OF COURSE 
NUMBERS WHICH ARE THE RESULT OF MULTIPLYING A NUMBER BY ITSELF 
LIKE NINE WHICH IS THREE X. THREE 
TWENTY FIVE WHICH IS FIVE X. FIVE 
YOU CAN THINK OF SQUARE NUMBERS IN TERMS OF THE AREA OF A SQUARE 
TWO SQUARED OR TWO X. TWO EQUALS FOUR 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE A SQUARE OF LENGTH TWO ON EACH SIDE 
HAS AN AREA OF ONE TWO THREE FOUR SQUARE UNITS 
TWO SQUARED EQUALS TWO X. TWO EQUALS FOUR 
BECAUSE A SQUARE WHERE EACH SIDE IS THREE UNITS 
HAS AN AREA WHICH EQUALS NINE SQUARE UNITS 
THREE SQUARED EQUALS THREE X. THREE EQUALS NINE 
NOW HERE'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION 
ONE SQUARED WHAT DOES IT EQUAL 
WELL ONE SQUARED IS ONE MULTIPLIED BY ITSELF 
OR ONE X. ONE EQUALS ONE 
YOU NEED TO KNOW ALL THE SQUARE NUMBERS UP TO ONE HUNDRED 
THAT'S UP TO TEN X. TEN SO HERE THEY ARE 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO LOOK AT SQUARE ROOTS 
SQUARE ROOTS ARE THE OPPOSITE OR INVERSE OF SQUARES 
TWO SQUARED EQUALS FOUR 
WORKING BACKWARDS FROM THAT 
THE SQUARE ROOT OF FOUR EQUALS TWO 
WE CAN WRITE THAT 
LIKE THIS 
THREE SQUARED EQUALS NINE WORKING BACKWARDS FROM THAT 
THE SQUARE ROOT OF NINE EQUALS THREE 
WE CAN WRITE THAT LIKE THIS 
NOW WE ALREADY KNOW THAT ONE SQUARED EQUALS ONE 
WORKING BACKWARDS FROM THAT THE SQUARE ROOT OF ONE EQUALS ONE 
WHICH IS THE SAME 
WE CAN WRITE IT LIKE THIS 
THE SQUARE ROOT OF ONE EQUALS ONE 
LET'S MOVE ON TO CUBES 
JUST LIKE YOU CAN THINK OF SQUARE NUMBERS 
IN TERMS OF THE AREA OF A SQUARE YOU CAN THINK OF CUBED NUMBERS 
IN TERMS OF THE VOLUME OF A CUBE 
SO A CUBE WITH LENGTH TWO UNITS WIDTH TWO UNITS AND HEIGHT TWO UNITS 
HAS A VOLUME OF TWO X. TWO X. TWO 
WHICH IS EIGHT UNITS CUBED 
SO TWO CUBED EQUALS EIGHT 
A CUBE WITH LENGTH THREE UNITS WIDTH THREE UNITS AND HEIGHT THREE UNITS 
HAS A VOLUME OF THREE X. THREE X. THREE 
THAT'S TWENTY SEVEN UNITS CUBED 
SO THREE CUBED EQUALS TWENTY SEVEN 
FOUR CUBED IS FOUR X. FOUR X. FOUR 
THAT'S SIXTEEN X. FOUR WHICH IS SIXTY FOUR 
AND FIVE CUBED IS FIVE X. FIVE X. FIVE 
THAT'S TWENTY FIVE X. FIVE EQUALS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AND SO ON 
SO WHAT'S OUR OLD FRIEND ONE CUBED 
WELL THAT'S ONE X. ONE X. ONE THAT'S ONE AGAIN 
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW ONE CUBED 
TWO CUBED 
ZERO POINT THREE CUBED 
ZERO POINT FOUR CUBED 
ZERO POINT FIVE CUBED 
AND TEN CUBED SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO RECOGNISE ONE EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN 
SIXTY FOUR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AND ONE THOUSAND 
AS THE CUBES OF ONE TWO THREE 
FOUR FIVE AND TEN 
NOW THERE'S A SHORT WAY 
OF WRITING A NUMBER SQUARED 
OR A NUMBER CUBED 
WE CAN WRITE FOR EXAMPLE FOUR SQUARED 
THAT'S FOUR X. FOUR 
AS FOUR WITH A SMALL TWO JUST AFTER AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE IT LIKE THIS 
IT'S A SMALL TWO BECAUSE WE'RE MULTIPLYING TWO NUMBER FOURS TOGETHER 
FOUR CUBED THAT'S FOUR X. FOUR X. FOUR 
CAN BE WRITTEN AS FOUR WITH A SMALL THREE JUST AFTER AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE IT 
IT'S A SMALL THREE BECAUSE WE'RE MULTIPLYING THREE NUMBER FOURS TOGETHER 
WRITING A NUMBER WITH A SMALL NUMBER AFTER IT IS CALLED INDEX NOTATION 
THE SMALL NUMBER ITSELF 
IS CALLED THE POWER OR INDEX NUMBER 
YOU MIGHT BE ASKED WHAT EIGHT TO THE POWER OF TWO IS 
THAT'S EIGHT WITH A LITTLE TWO AFTER IT 
AND THAT TWO MEANS THAT THERE ARE TWO EIGHTS MULTIPLIED TOGETHER 
EIGHT X. EIGHT 
WHAT DOES THAT GIVE US 
EIGHT TO THE POWER OF TWO EQUALS EIGHT X. EIGHT EQUALS SIXTY FOUR 
A COMMON MISTAKE IS TO THINK THAT EIGHT TO THE POWER OF TWO 
IS THE SAME AS EIGHT X. TWO IT'S NOT 
EIGHT TO THE POWER OF TWO IS EIGHT SQUARED 
OR EIGHT X. EIGHT WHICH EQUALS SIXTY FOUR 
EIGHT X. TWO EQUALS SIXTEEN 
SO INDEX NOTATION IS A KIND OF SHORTHAND 
WITH THAT POWER OR INDEX NUMBER 
TELLING US HOW MANY TIMES WE'RE MULTIPLYING A NUMBER TOGETHER 
THIS SYSTEM GOES BEYOND SQUARES AND CUBES 
WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT NINE TO THE POWER OF TWO 
WHICH IS NINE SQUARED OR NINE X. NINE 
NINE TO THE POWER OF THREE IS NINE X. NINE X. NINE OR NINE CUBED 
NINE X. NINE X. NINE X. NINE 
CAN BE WRITTEN NINE TO THE POWER OF FOUR 
INSTEAD OF WRITING NINE X. NINE X. NINE X. NINE X. NINE X. NINE X. NINE 
WE CAN WRITE NINE TO THE POWER OF SEVEN 
WHEN THE NUMBERS GET COMPLICATED WE CAN USE A CALCULATOR 
ONE WAY TO CALCULATE NINE TO THE POWER OF SEVEN 
IS TO ACTUALLY MULTIPLY NINE BY NINE 
BY NINE BY NINE 
BY NINE BY NINE 
BY NINE SEVEN TIMES 
THAT'S ACTUALLY FOUR MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE 
BUT IF YOU HAVE A SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR 
YOU CAN CALCULATE IT USING THE SPECIAL POWER BUTTON ON IT 
YOU PRESS NINE 
TO THE POWER 
SEVEN 
EQUALS 
WHICH GIVES THE SAME ANSWER WITH FOUR BUTTON PRESSES 
INSTEAD OF FOURTEEN 
TO CALCULATE SQUARE ROOTS ON A CALCULATOR 
THERE'S A SPECIAL SQUARE ROOT BUTTON WHICH IS HERE 
SO LET'S FIND THE SQUARE ROOT OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE 
ON THE CALCULATOR YOU PRESS ONE SIX NINE 
FOLLOWED BY THE ROOT BUTTON 
ON SOME CALCULATORS YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE SQUARE ROOT BUTTON FIRST 
THEN THE NUMBER THEN EQUALS TO GET THE ANSWER 
AND THE ANSWER IS THIRTEEN 
IN FACT EVERY NUMBER HAS A SQUARE ROOT 
NOT JUST THE FAMILIAR ONES LIKE ONE FOUR NINE 
SIXTEEN TWENTY FIVE AND SO ON 
TO WORK OUT THE SQUARE ROOT OF TWELVE 
ENTER TWELVE AND THEN PRESS THE SQUARE ROOT BUTTON 
AND THE ANSWER IS THIRTY FOUR MILLION SIX HUNDRED FORTY ONE THOUSAND SIXTEEN 
NOW IF WE WERE TO ROUND THIS OFF TO TWO DECIMAL PLACES 
THEN THE ANSWER IS THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX 
HERE ARE SOME NUMBER CARDS 
THEY SHOW US THE NUMBERS THREE TWO TO THE POWER OF SIX 
EIGHTY ONE EIGHT SQUARED 
SIXTY FOUR AND EIGHT 
NOW ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS 
STOP THE TAPE AND HAVE A GO AT THAT YOURSELF 
HOW DID YOU GET ON 
WE ARE SHOWN CARDS 
THAT DISPLAY THE NUMBERS THREE 
TWO TO THE POWER OF SIX EIGHTY ONE 
EIGHT SQUARED SIXTY FOUR AND EIGHT 
AND ASKED TO DO SOME QUESTIONS 
THE ANSWER NINE SQUARED EQUALS NINE X. NINE 
WHICH FROM YOUR TIMES TABLES IS EIGHTY ONE 
TWO CUBED IS TWO X. TWO X. TWO 
AND AGAIN FROM YOUR TIMES TABLE TWO X. TWO EQUALS FOUR 
X. TWO AGAIN EQUALS EIGHT 
REMEMBER THAT THE SQUARE ROOT OF NINE 
IS THE NUMBER THAT WHEN SQUARED THAT'S MULTIPLIED BY ITSELF 
GIVES NINE THE ANSWER TO THAT IS THREE 
BECAUSE THREE X. THREE EQUALS NINE 
REMEMBER THAN AN INDEX NUMBER OR POWER 
IS THE SMALL NUMBER JUST AFTER AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE MAIN NUMBER 
SO THE CARD WITH AN INDEX NUMBER OF TWO 
IS THE NUMBER WITH A LITTLE TWO JUST AFTER IT 
SO THE CARD WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS EIGHT TO THE POWER OF TWO OR EIGHT SQUARED 
LET'S LOOK AT TWO TO THE POWER OF SIX 
WHICH IS TWO X. TWO X. TWO X. TWO X. TWO X. TWO 
WORKING THAT OUT IS SIXTY FOUR 
THEN WE HAVE THE CARD EIGHTY ONE SO THAT'S NO GOOD 
LOOK AT EIGHT TO THE POWER OF TWO WHICH IS EIGHT SQUARED 
THAT'S EIGHT X. EIGHT EQUALS SIXTY FOUR AGAIN SO WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE 
FINALLY WE HAVE THE CARD SIXTY FOUR ITSELF 
SO THAT'S IT 
THE THREE CARDS WITH NUMBERS 
THAT ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER 
ARE TWO TO THE POWER OF SIX 
EIGHT SQUARED AND SIXTY FOUR 
NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO RATIO 
WE'VE ALREADY LOOKED AT THE UNITARY METHOD 
THIS WAS WHERE WE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE COST OF ONE THING 
AS A STEP TO CALCULATING THE COST OF MORE THAN ONE THING 
IT'S USEFUL WHEN CONVERTING BETWEEN CURRENCIES FOR INSTANCE 
EXTENDING THIS IDEA WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO RATIOS 
RATIOS ARE ABOUT THE PROPORTIONS OF ONE QUANTITY TO ANOTHER 
O. K. SO RATIOS CAN BE USED WHEN QUANTITIES VARY 
BUT THEY HAVE TO BE KEPT IN THE SAME PROPORTIONS 
TAKE THIS RECIPE FOR EXAMPLE 
IT SAYS TO MAKE TWELVE PANCAKES YOU NEED THREE EGGS 
NINE HUNDRED MILLILITRES OF MILK 
AND THREE HUNDRED GRAMS OF PLAIN FLOUR 
SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I ALTERED THE QUANTITIES 
TO MAKE TWELVE PANCAKES 
WE NEED THREE EGGS NINE HUNDRED MILLILITRES OF MILK AND THREE HUNDRED GRAMS OF FLOUR 
WE CAN REPRESENT THIS AS A RATIO FOR EGGS TO MILK TO FLOUR 
WHICH IN THIS INSTANCE WOULD BE THREE NINE HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED 
NOW IF WE WISH TO MAKE DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF PANCAKES 
THEN WE NEED DOUBLE THE QUANTITIES 
SO WE WOULD HAVE SIX EGGS 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED MILLILITRES OF MILK 
AND SIX HUNDRED GRAMS OF FLOUR 
WHICH AS A RATIO WOULD BE SIX ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED 
NOW IF WE WANT A THIRD OF THE ORIGINAL NUMBER OF PANCAKES 
LET'S REMIND OURSELVES OF THE ORIGINAL QUANTITIES 
TO MAKE TWELVE PANCAKES IT WAS THREE EGGS 
NINE HUNDRED MILLILITRES OF MILK AND THREE HUNDRED GRAMS OF FLOUR 
AND THE RATIO WAS THREE NINE HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED 
WELL WITH ONE THIRD OF THE ORIGINAL QUANTITIES 
WE WILL GET ONE THIRD OF THE NUMBER OF PANCAKES 
SO WE'LL HAVE ONE INSTEAD OF THREE 
THREE HUNDRED INSTEAD OF NINE HUNDRED 
AND ONE HUNDRED INSTEAD OF THREE HUNDRED 
SO INSTEAD OF OUR ORIGINAL TWELVE PANCAKES 
WE WILL ACTUALLY MAKE FOUR PANCAKES 
REMEMBERING OF COURSE AS LONG AS WE KEEP THE RELATIVE PROPORTIONS 
OF EACH INGREDIENT THE SAME OUR RECIPE STILL WORKS 
SO WHEN WE DOUBLED THE RECIPE WE DOUBLED EVERYTHING 
AND WHEN WE DIVIDED BY THREE WE DIVIDED EVERYTHING BY THREE 
BUT LOOKING AT IT THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
SUPPOSE WE'VE GOT TWENTY FOUR PANCAKES 
AND WE NEED TO DIVIDE THEM BETWEEN THREE PEOPLE 
BUT IN THE RATIO ONE TWO THREE HOW WOULD THIS WORK 
SUPPOSE THE PEOPLE ARE CALLED JIM ALAN AND JANE 
AND WE WISH TO SHARE THE PANCAKES BETWEEN THEM IN THE RATIO OF ONE TWO THREE 
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PARTS IS ONE TWO THREE WHICH IS SIX 
SO SIX PARTS REPRESENT TWENTY FOUR PANCAKES 
NOW HOW MANY PANCAKES DOES EACH PART REPRESENT 
TWENTY FOUR SIX EQUALS FOUR 
SO FOUR PANCAKES REPRESENT ONE PART 
NOW IF WE SHARE THE PANCAKES BETWEEN JIM ALAN AND JANE 
IN THE RATIO OF ONE TWO THREE THAT MEANS 
JIM WITH ONE PART WILL GET FOUR X. ONE OR FOUR PANCAKES 
ALAN WITH TWO PARTS WILL GET TWO X. FOUR OR EIGHT PANCAKES 
AND JANE WITH THREE PARTS WILL GET THREE X. FOUR OR TWELVE PANCAKES 
REMEMBERING OF COURSE THAT THE RATIO OF FOUR OH EIGHT 
IS THE SAME AS A RATIO OF ONE TWO THREE 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME AND HAVE A GO 
AT THE EXAM QUESTION ON RATIO 
NO CALCULATOR AS IT'S ON PAPER ONE 
PART A RATIO IS A WAY OF COMPARING TWO NUMBERS 
AND SOMETIMES IT'S ALSO A WAY OF TELLING YOU 
HOW TO DIVIDE A NUMBER IN UNEQUAL PARTS 
WE'RE TOLD THAT IN THIS PATTERN THE RATIO OF GREY TO BLACK IS THREE ONE 
AND ASKED WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE DESIGN IS BLACK 
THE RATIO OF THREE ONE MEANS THAT THERE ARE THREE GREY PARTS AND ONE BLACK PART 
SO THERE ARE FOUR PARTS ALTOGETHER 
ONE OUT OF FOUR PARTS ARE BLACK 
SO BLACK IS TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IS THE ANSWER 
PART B. WE'RE TOLD THAT SIXTY PER CENT IS GREY AND THE REST IS BLACK 
AND ASKED WHAT THE RATIO OF GREY TO BLACK IS 
IF SIXTY PER CENT IS GREY THIS MEANS THAT FORTY PER CENT IS BLACK 
THE RATIO OF GREY TO BLACK IS SIXTY FORTY 
TO PUT THE RATIO IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM 
YOU HAVE TO DIVIDE BY COMMON FACTORS 
JUST LIKE SIMPLIFYING FRACTIONS 
TWENTY IS THE LARGEST NUMBER THAT GOES INTO SIXTY AND FORTY 
SIXTY TWENTY EQUALS THREE 
AND FORTY TWENTY EQUALS TWO 
SO THE SIMPLIFIED RATIO IS THREE TWO 
THAT'S IT FOR THIS SECTION ON NUMBER 
IF THERE WAS ANYTHING YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND 
JUST GO BACK AND TAKE ANOTHER LOOK 
THIS NEXT SECTION LOOKS AT GRAPH WORK 
THIS UNIT ON GRAPHS IS DIVIDED INTO THREE SECTIONS 
ONE ON COORDINATES ONE ON MAPPINGS 
AND ANOTHER ON STRAIGHT LINE GRAPHS 
LET'S BEGIN WITH COORDINATES 
IF I TAKE A POINT HERE FOR EXAMPLE 
HOW COULD ITS EXACT LOCATION BE EXPLAINED 
THAT'S WHERE COORDINATES COME IN 
TAKE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS TOURIST 
TRYING TO GET FROM ONE PART OF LONDON TO ANOTHER 
NOW SHE'S TRYING TO FIND COVENT GARDEN IN LONDON 
SHE KNOWS IT'S ON THIS PAGE OF HER MAP IN SQUARE J. SEVEN 
SO SHE FINDS COLUMNS J. AND ROW SEVEN 
AND WHERE SHE'S TRYING TO GET TO IS COVENT GARDEN 
SO ANY SQUARE ON THE MAP CAN BE LOCATED 
BY USING THE NUMBERS AND LETTERS ON THE GRID 
THE LETTER AND NUMBER PAIR J. SEVEN 
IS CALLED THE COORDINATE OF THE SQUARE 
AND IT TELLS US EXACTLY WHERE IT IS ON THE PAGE 
WE CAN DO THE SAME WITH A GRAPH LIKE THIS 
WE CAN FIND THE COORDINATE OF ANY POINT 
BY USING THE X. AXIS THAT GOES ACROSS THE GRAPH HORIZONTALLY 
REMEMBER X. IS ACROSS AND THE Y. AXIS 
THAT GOES UP AND DOWN THE GRAPH VERTICALLY 
ALL POINTS ARE MEASURED FROM THIS POINT HERE ZERO 
WHERE THE X. AND THE Y. AXES MEET 
ALSO CALLED THE ORIGIN 
THIS POINT HERE WOULD BE 
TWO ALONG AND ONE UP OR TWENTY ONE 
THIS POINT HERE WOULD BE 
FOUR ALONG AND THREE UP OR FORTY THREE 
LET'S FIND A POINT ON THE GRAPH 
FORTY THREE 
FIRST OF ALL YOU START WITH THE X. COORDINATE 
SO WE GO ALONG TO FOUR 
AND THEN YOU FIND THE Y. COORDINATE SO WE GO UP TO THREE 
WHICH BRINGS US 
TO THIS POINT HERE 
LET'S LABEL IT FORTY THREE 
WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU OPEN A BRACKET 
YOU WRITE THE X. COORDINATE FIRST 
THEN YOU PUT A COMMA 
THEN YOU WRITE THE Y. COORDINATE AND YOU CLOSE THE BRACKET 
THE ORDER YOU DO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT 
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER POINT 
WITH SIMILAR NUMBERS BUT THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
LET'S LOOK AT THIRTY FOUR 
THREE ALONG ON THE X. AXIS 
AND THEN FOUR UP WHICH BRINGS US TO THIS POINT HERE 
AND REMEMBERING WHEN YOU WRITE DOWN COORDINATES 
YOU WRITE THE X. COORDINATE FIRST THREE 
AND THEN THE COMMA AND THEN FOUR AND THEN WE CLOSE THE BRACKET 
AS YOU CAN SEE THIRTY FOUR IS A VERY DIFFERENT POINT TO FORTY THREE 
BUT THIS IS ONLY ONE QUARTER 
OR QUADRANT OF A MUCH BIGGER GRAPH 
AND WE CAN USE COORDINATES 
TO SPECIFY POINTS 
IN ANY OF THOSE FOUR QUADRANTS 
IN THE FIRST QUADRANT 
THE NUMBERS ON THE X. AXIS AND Y. AXIS 
ARE POSITIVE 
SO ALL THE POINTS IN THIS QUADRANT 
HAVE POSITIVE X. AND Y. VALUES 
LIKE FORTY THREE 
IF WE GO DOWN TO THE NEXT QUADRANT 
ALL THE POINTS IN HERE 
HAVE POSITIVE X. NUMBERS 
BUT NEGATIVE Y. NUMBERS 
LIKE FOUR MINUS THREE 
AND IF WE GO INTO THIS QUADRANT 
THE POINTS HERE HAVE BOTH NEGATIVE X. VALUES 
AND NEGATIVE Y. VALUES LIKE MINUS FOUR MINUS THREE 
AND FINALLY IN THIS QUADRANT 
WE HAVE NEGATIVE X. AND POSITIVE Y. VALUES 
LIKE MINUS FOUR THREE SO ALL FOUR QUADRANTS OF THE GRAPH 
WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS 
WE'VE BEEN GIVEN THE COORDINATES 
OF THE CORNER MARKED WITH X. FOR TILE ONE 
PART A WE ARE ASKED TO GIVE THE COORDINATES 
OF THE CORNER WITH A CIRCLE ON TILE NUMBER TWO 
THE COORDINATES OF THE CORNER WITH A CIRCLE ARE AT THIS POINT HERE 
STARTING AT THE ORIGIN WE MOVE ACROSS FIRST 
FOUR ACROSS AND UP FOUR SO THAT'S THE POINT FORTY FOUR 
PART B. ASKS WHAT ARE THE COORDINATES OF THE CORNER 
WITH A CIRCLE ON TILE NUMBER FOUR 
WE CAN SEE THAT THE COORDINATES OF THE CORNER 
WITH A CIRCLE ON TILE NUMBER ONE IS TWENTY TWO 
ON TILE NUMBER TWO WE WORKED IT OUT TO BE FORTY FOUR 
AND ON TILE NUMBER THREE IT IS SIXTY SIX 
SO WE MIGHT EXPECT THE CORNER FOR TILE NUMBER FOUR 
TO HAVE COORDINATES TWICE THE TILE NUMBER TWO 
THAT'S EIGHTY EIGHT BUT LET'S JUST CHECK 
BY EXTENDING THE DIAGRAM A LITTLE 
THIS IS WHERE THE COORDINATES 
OF THE CORNER WITH A CIRCLE 
ON TILE NUMBER FOUR WOULD BE 
AND STARTING AT THE ORIGIN 
WE MOVE ACROSS FIRST 
EIGHT ACROSS RIGHT 
AND UP EIGHT 
SO THAT'S THE POINT EIGHTY EIGHT 
FINALLY PART C. SAYS 
DANIEL MARKS THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER OF EACH TILE WITH AN X. 
WE HAVE TO FILL IN THE TABLE 
TO SHOW THE COORDINATES OF EACH CORNER WITH AN X. 
AND WE'VE BEEN GIVEN THE COORDINATES 
OF THE CORNER MARKED WITH X. FOR TILE ONE 
THAT'S HERE STARTING AT THE ORIGIN WE MOVE ACROSS FIRST 
TWO ACROSS RIGHT AND UP ONE SO THAT'S THE POINT TWENTY ONE 
THEN FOR TILE TWO THE CORNER MARKED WITH AN X. 
IS HERE THAT'S STARTING AT THE ORIGIN 
ACROSS FOUR UP THREE 
SO THAT HAS THE COORDINATES FORTY THREE 
THEN FOR TILE NUMBER THREE THE CORNER MARKED WITH AN X. IS HERE 
STARTING AT THE ORIGIN ACROSS SIX AND UP FIVE 
SO THAT HAS COORDINATES SIXTY FIVE 
AND FINALLY FOR TILE FOUR WE CAN LOOK AT THE PATTERN 
IN THE X. COORDINATES SO FAR 
THAT'S TWO FOUR SIX 
SO WE WOULD EXPECT TILE FOUR TO CONTINUE ADDING TWO 
AND HAVE X. COORDINATES EIGHT 
AND WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT THE PATTERN IN THE Y. COORDINATES SO FAR 
THAT'S ONE THREE FIVE 
SO WE WOULD EXPECT TILE FOUR TO CONTINUE ADDING TWO AGAIN 
AND HAVE Y. COORDINATES SEVEN 
LET'S JUST CHECK THOUGH BY EXTENDING THE DIAGRAM 
THE CORNER MARKED WITH AN X. 
FOR TILE FOUR WOULD BE HERE 
AND STARTING AT THE ORIGIN 
ACROSS EIGHT AND UP SEVEN 
THAT'S COORDINATES EIGHTY SEVEN 
NOW ON TO MAPPINGS 
IN THIS EXAMPLE WE SAY THESE VALUES MAP ON TO ONE ANOTHER 
SO TWO MAPS TO ONE 
ONE MAPS TO ZERO 
ZERO MAPS TO NEGATIVE OR MINUS ONE 
NEGATIVE ONE MAPS TO NEGATIVE TWO 
AND NEGATIVE TWO MAPS TO NEGATIVE THREE 
SO IN OTHER WORDS FOR EACH ARROW 
WE SUBTRACT ONE TO TAKE US TO THE NEW VALUE 
SO THE RULE OF THIS MAPPING 
IS TO SUBTRACT ONE 
SO WHEN X. IS TWO Y. IS ONE 
WHEN X. IS ONE Y. IS ZERO 
WHEN X. IS ZERO Y. IS MINUS ONE AND SO ON 
IN FACT WE CAN WRITE THIS AS AN EQUATION 
Y. EQUALS X. ONE AND WE CAN PLOT OUR COORDINATES 
TO GIVE THE GRAPH OF THIS EQUATION 
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE 
TAKE THIS MAPPING DIAGRAM OR THIS TABLE 
SHOWING THE VALUES OF X. AND Y. 
WHEN X. IS TWO Y. IS FIVE 
WHEN X. IS ONE Y. IS FOUR 
WHEN X. IS ZERO Y. IS THREE AND SO ON 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN X. AND Y. 
IS SUCH THAT Y. IS ALWAYS THE X. VALUE PLUS THREE 
WE CAN PLOT OUR COORDINATES 
TO GIVE THE GRAPH OF THIS EQUATION 
LET'S MOVE ON TO STRAIGHT LINE GRAPHS 
FOR INSTANCE SOME STUDENTS AT THIS SCHOOL 
HAVE SET UP A SMALL INTERNET CAFE DURING LUNCHTIMES AND AFTER SCHOOL 
THEY CHARGE ONE TO JOIN 
AND TWO FOR EVERY SESSION SPENT ON THE INTERNET 
IN OTHER WORDS THE ONE FEE IS FIXED AND THE REST OF THE COST 
DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF SESSIONS THE STUDENTS GO TO 
AND AT TWO IT'S TWICE THE NUMBER OF SESSIONS ATTENDED 
THE STUDENTS CAN WORK OUT THE TOTAL CHARGES USING AN EQUATION 
LET'S GO TO OUR EXPERT FOR MORE INFORMATION 
THE TOTAL COST IN POUNDS FOR EACH STUDENT 
EQUALS TWO FOR EACH SESSION ATTENDED 
SO TWO X. THE NUMBER OF SESSIONS A FIXED JOINING FEE 
NOW THE COST OF THAT JOINING FEE IS ONE 
RIGHT SO IF WE USE Y. TO REPRESENT THE TOTAL COST 
AND X. TO REPRESENT THE NUMBER OF SESSIONS THEN 
THE TOTAL COST EQUALS Y. 
WHICH EQUALS TWO TIMES X. PLUS ONE 
WE CAN ALSO WRITE THAT LIKE THIS 
Y. EQUALS TWO X. ONE 
THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN REPRESENT THIS EQUATION 
IN ORDER TO PLOT THE POINTS AS A GRAPH WE CAN USE MAPPING 
THE X. VALUES 
ARE PUT INTO A COLUMN 
AND THESE ARE MAPPED ON TO Y. VALUES 
ACCORDING TO THE EQUATION 
SO TAKING THE FIRST VALUE X. EQUALS ONE 
TWO X. ONE ONE GIVES US A VALUE OF THREE 
SO X. EQUALS ONE MAPS ON TO Y. EQUALS THREE 
TAKING THE SECOND VALUE X. EQUALS TWO 
TWO X. TWO ONE EQUALS FIVE 
SO TWO MAPS ON TO FIVE AND SO ON 
NOW ANOTHER WAY WE CAN REPRESENT THIS EQUATION 
IS IN THE FORM OF A TABLE 
THE NUMBER OF SESSIONS X. AND THE TOTAL CHARGE IN POUNDS OF Y. 
SO REMEMBERING TO USE THE EQUATION 
THE VALUE OF ONE FOR X. TWO X. ONE ONE 
GIVES A TOTAL CHARGE OF THREE FOR ONE SESSION 
THE VALUE X. OF TWO USING THE EQUATION 
TWO X. TWO ONE 
GIVES A TOTAL CHARGE OF FIVE FOR THOSE SESSIONS 
ALL OF THESE VALUES CAN BE PLOTTED AS COORDINATES ON A GRAPH 
O. K. THE FIRST COORDINATE THIRTEEN 
IS LOCATED HERE ONE ON THE X. 
AND UP TO THREE ON THE Y. 
LET'S MARK THAT POINT AND LABEL IT 
BRACKET ONE COMMA THREE CLOSE BRACKET 
THE SECOND POINT TWENTY FIVE 
TWO ON THE X. COORDINATE 
AND FIVE COMING UP TO FIVE 
ON THE Y. COORDINATE 
LET'S MARK IT AND LABEL IT 
BRACKET TWO COMMA FIVE CLOSE BRACKET 
AND A THIRD POINT THIRTY SEVEN 
THREE ON THE X. AND UP TO SEVEN 
OPEN BRACKET THREE COMMA SEVEN CLOSE BRACKET 
NOW WE CAN JOIN THESE POINTS AS A STRAIGHT LINE 
AND THE INTERSECTION OF THESE POINTS 
IS HERE AT ONE 
WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE ONE IN THIS EQUATION 
RIGHT NOW YOU CAN USE ANY VALUE OF X. THAT YOU WANT 
TO CALCULATE THE CORRESPONDING VALUE FOR Y. IN THE FORMULA 
WE JUST HAPPENED TO USE THESE PARTICULAR ONES 
BUT WHEN YOU DO YOUR CALCULATIONS FOR THE GRAPH YOU SHOULD NOTICE 
IF YOU PLOT TWO POINTS IT SHOULD GIVE YOU A STRAIGHT LINE 
BUT YOU SHOULD DO A THIRD AS A CHECK 
AND IF YOU DON'T GET A STRAIGHT LINE YOU SHOULD RE CHECK YOUR CALCULATIONS 
LET'S TAKE IT A BIT FURTHER 
IF WE CONSIDER THE EQUATION Y. EQUALS TWO X. ONE 
WE CAN DRAW IT LIKE THIS 
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THE INTERSECTION WITH THE Y. AXIS IS HERE 
WHERE Y. EQUALS ONE AND THAT CORRESPONDS TO ONE IN THE EQUATION 
IF WE LOOK AT THIS EQUATION Y. EQUALS TWO X. FOUR 
IF WE DRAW IT IT WILL LOOK LIKE THIS 
NOW HERE WE CAN SEE THAT THIS LINE IS PARALLEL TO THE FIRST LINE 
BUT THE INTERSECTION HERE WITH THE Y. AXIS IS AT FOUR 
AND THAT CORRESPONDS TO FOUR IN THE EQUATION 
RIGHT THE LAST EQUATION WE'LL LOOK AT IS Y. EQUALS TWO X. TWO 
AND IF WE DRAW THIS EQUATION IT WILL LOOK LIKE THIS 
AND HERE AGAIN IT'S PARALLEL TO THE FIRST TWO 
AND THE INTERSECTION WITH THE Y. AXIS IS AT MINUS TWO 
AND THAT CORRESPONDS 
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER EQUATION 
LET'S CONSIDER THE EQUATION X. EQUALS FOUR 
IF YOU WANT TO REPRESENT THIS AS A GRAPH WE NEED COORDINATE PAIRS 
SO LET'S START WITH ERM Y. EQUALS ZERO 
Y. EQUALS ZERO AND X. EQUALS FOUR 
LET'S DRAW THAT IN 
X. AXIS FOUR COMMA AND THEN A ZERO 
AND WE CLOSE THE BRACKETS 
LET'S CONSIDER ANOTHER POINT 
ERM WHEN Y. EQUALS TWO X. EQUALS FOUR 
SO IF WE PLOT THAT POINT 
WE COME HERE 
LET'S LABEL THAT REMEMBER X. COORDINATE IS WRITTEN FIRST 
FOUR C. O. M. M. A TWO 
AND ONE MORE POINT WHEN Y. IS FOUR X. IS STILL FOUR 
AND THAT BRINGS US TO THIS POINT WHICH IS HERE 
AND WHEN WE LABEL THAT X. COORDINATE FIRST 
FOUR COMMA FOUR CLOSE BRACKET 
SO LET'S DRAW THE LINE 
SO THIS VERTICAL LINE 
IS THE GRAPH OF THE EQUATION X. EQUALS FOUR 
LET'S CONSIDER ANOTHER EXAMPLE THE EQUATION Y. EQUALS MINUS ONE 
WE CAN REPRESENT THIS AS A GRAPH BY DRAWING COORDINATE POINTS 
O. K. IF WE CONSIDER WHERE X. EQUALS ZERO THAT'S HERE 
Y. EQUALS MINUS ONE 
SO LET'S MARK THIS POINT AND LABEL IT 
OPEN BRACKETS X. COORDINATE FIRST 
ZERO COMMA MINUS ONE CLOSE BRACKETS 
O. K. LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER POINT 
LET'S CONSIDER X. EQUALS TWO 
RIGHT 
X. EQUALS TWO IS HERE 
Y. STILL EQUALS MINUS ONE 
THAT BRINGS US TO THIS POINT 
LET'S MARK IT 
AND LABEL IT 
OPEN BRACKETS X. COORDINATE FIRST 
TWO COMMA MINUS ONE AND CLOSE BRACKETS 
WE CAN JOIN THESE POINTS WITH A LINE 
IN FACT WHATEVER VALUE OF X. WE USE Y. IS ALWAYS MINUS ONE 
TO DRAW A STRAIGHT LINE GRAPH 
WORK OUT TWO POINTS WHICH JOIN UP TO CREATE THE STRAIGHT LINE 
AND THEN A THIRD POINT THAT SHOULD BE ON THE LINE 
TO CHECK THAT YOU'VE DRAWN THE LINE CORRECTLY 
THE EQUATION OF A STRAIGHT LINE GRAPH IS WRITTEN 
WITH A Y. VALUE EQUAL TO AN X. TERM FOLLOWED BY A NUMBER 
THE NUMBER TELLS US WHERE THE GRAPH CROSSES THE Y. AXIS 
THE GRAPH SHOWS A STRAIGHT LINE 
PART A FILL IN THE TABLE 
FOR SOME OF THE POINTS ON THE LINE 
PART B. WRITE AN EQUATION OF THE STRAIGHT LINE 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME TO HAVE A GO AT THIS EXAM QUESTION 
THIS QUESTION IS ALL ABOUT COORDINATES 
AND LOOKING FOR RULES THAT LINK COORDINATES 
WHEN THEY MAKE STRAIGHT LINES ON A GRAPH 
THE FIRST PART ASKS YOU TO FILL IN A TABLE 
REMEMBER THAT THE FIRST COORDINATE IN ANY PAIR IS THE X. COORDINATE 
WHICH GOES ACROSS AND THE SECOND IS Y. WHICH GOES UP 
THIS POINT IS THIRTEEN 
THIS POINT IS TWENTY TWO 
THIS POINT IS THIRTY ONE 
THIS POINT IS FORTY 
YOU COULD ALSO HAVE CHOSEN 
THERE ARE MANY MORE 
WE WRITE THEM IN THE TABLE 
IF YOU LOOK AT EACH PAIR 
THEY ALWAYS ADD UP TO FOUR 
SO THE EQUATION IS X. Y. EQUALS FOUR 
NOW FOR ANOTHER USE OF STRAIGHT LINE GRAPHS 
IF FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE ONE HUNDRED WE CAN USE STRAIGHT LINE GRAPHS 
TO WORK OUT THE NUMBER OF EUROS WE CAN GET FOR THIS 
HERE'S OUR EXPERT 
WELL IF WE CONSIDER A CURRENCY RATE OF ONE GIVES ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EUROS 
THEN IF I HAVE ONE HUNDRED I WILL HAVE ONE HUNDRED TIMES THAT AMOUNT OF EUROS 
THE ANSWER THEN IS ONE HUNDRED EQUALS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EUROS 
LET'S CONSIDER OTHER VALUES 
THE ANSWER IS TO DRAW A CONVERSION GRAPH 
WE HAVE POUNDS HERE ON THE Y. AXIS AND WE HAVE EUROS ON THE X. AXIS 
WE COULD HAVE DRAWN THIS THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
BUT WE'VE JUST CHOSEN TO DO IT THIS WAY 
RIGHT LET'S PLOT THE POINTS THAT WE KNOW 
WE HAVE ONE HUNDRED EQUALS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EUROS SO WE FIND ONE HUNDRED HERE 
AND THEN WE FIND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EUROS WHICH BRINGS US TO THIS POINT HERE 
WE KNOW ANOTHER POINT WHERE ZERO IS ZERO EUROS WHICH IS THIS POINT HERE 
SO LET'S CONNECT THESE POINTS WITH A STRAIGHT LINE USING THE RULER 
WE CAN CHECK IF WE'VE DONE THIS CORRECTLY 
BY LOOKING AT ANOTHER VALUE 
SO FOR TEN WHICH IS HERE 
IT SHOULD BE FIFTEEN EUROS AND YES WE'VE DONE THAT CORRECTLY 
WE CAN USE THIS GRAPH TO CALCULATE HOW MANY EUROS WE WILL GET FOR SEVENTY 
SEVENTY IS HERE 
WHICH GIVES US 
ZERO POINT ONE ZERO FIVE EUROS 
SEVENTY IS 
ONE HUNDRED FIVE EUROS 
WE CAN DO THIS THE OTHER WAY AROUND 
WE CAN FIND HOW MANY POUNDS WE GET FOR SEVENTY EUROS 
O. K. THIS TIME STARTING ON THE X. AXIS 
SEVENTY EUROS IS HERE 
GIVES A VALUE IN POUNDS 
OF FORTY SEVEN 
SEVENTY EUROS EQUALS FORTY SEVEN 
THIS QUESTION IS ABOUT 
SPEED DISTANCE AND TIME 
THE LINE ON THE GRAPH BELOW REPRESENTS A SPEED OF SIXTY K. M. SLASH HOUR 
PART A DRAW A LINE ON THE GRAPH 
TO REPRESENT A SPEED OF THIRTY K. M. SLASH HOUR 
LABEL THE LINE BY WRITING THIRTY K. M. SLASH HOUR 
PART B. NOW DRAW A LINE ON THE GRAPH 
TO REPRESENT A SPEED OF ONE TWENTY K. M. SLASH HOUR 
LABEL THE LINE BY WRITING ONE TWENTY K. M. SLASH HOUR 
IN THIS QUESTION 
SPEED IS THE DISTANCE THAT YOU TRAVEL IN ONE HOUR 
WE ARE MEASURING DISTANCE IN KILOMETRES 
THE LINE THEY SHOW ON THE GRAPH COMPARES DISTANCE WITH TIME 
FOR A CONSTANT SPEED OF SIXTY K. M. SLASH HOUR 
NOTICE THAT MINUTES ARE MARKED ON THE AXIS 
IF YOU TRAVEL SIXTY K. M. IN SIXTY MINUTES YOU WOULD GO THIRTY K. M. IN THIRTY MINUTES 
OR TEN K. M. IN TEN MINUTES 
PART A ASKS YOU TO PLOT THE LINE THAT REPRESENTS THIRTY K. M. SLASH HOUR 
YOU CAN PLOT A POINT AT THIRTY K. M. IN SIXTY MINUTES AND FIFTEEN K. M. IN THIRTY MINUTES 
AND ZERO K. M. IN ZERO MINUTES THAT'S A GOOD ONE TO CHOOSE 
BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TRAVEL ANY DISTANCE 
IF YOU HAVE NO TIME AT ALL 
NOW PLOT THE LINE 
PART B. ASKS YOU TO PLOT THE LINE 
THAT REPRESENTS THE SPEED OF ONE TWENTY K. M. SLASH HOUR 
YOU GO ONE TWENTY K. M. IN SIXTY MINUTES BUT THIS ISN'T ON THE GRAPH 
SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW FAR YOU GO IN THIRTY MINUTES 
YOU'VE HALVED THE TIME SO YOU HALVE THE DISTANCE 
YOU TRAVEL SIXTY K. M. IN THIRTY MINUTES 
IF YOU DIVIDE BOTH DISTANCE AND TIME BY THREE YOU TRAVEL TWENTY K. M. IN TEN MINUTES 
AND OF COURSE YOU TRAVEL ZERO K. M. IN ZERO MINUTES 
NOW WE PLOT THE POINTS AND PLOT THE LINE 
SIXTY IN THIRTY TWENTY IN TEN AND ZERO IN ZERO 
JOIN THE POINTS 
THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER WAYS OF DOING THIS QUESTION 
CAN YOU THINK OF ANOTHER QUICKER WAY OF DOING IT 
THAT'S THE END OF THIS SECTION ON GRAPHS 
THIS NEXT SECTION IS ABOUT HANDLING DATA 
IN THIS SECTION WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT COLLECTING AND REPRESENTING DATA 
AND COMPARING DATA 
TO START WITH COLLECTING AND REPRESENTING DATA 
WE'LL LOOK AT TALLY CHARTS TABLES 
BAR GRAPHS PIE CHARTS AND LINE GRAPHS 
LET'S TAKE A GAME OF BASKETBALL 
IF WE TAKE DATA ABOUT HOW A TEAM SCORED OVER A RANGE OF MATCHES 
AND THE PERFORMANCES OF INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS OVER A SEASON 
THIS IS CALLED RAW DATA 
TO SORT OUT RAW DATA WE USE A TALLY CHART 
WE'RE GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON THE SCORES OF FORTY DIFFERENT PLAYERS 
WHO HAVE PLAYED FOR THIS CLUB DURING THE LAST SEASON 
THEIR SCORES RANGE FROM ZERO TO FORTY THREE 
ALTHOUGH WE CAN LIST THE SCORES INDIVIDUALLY 
IT WOULD MAKE A VERY LARGE TABLE 
SO TO MAKE MORE SENSE OF IT 
WE CAN BUNCH THE DATA UP INTO GROUPS 
THE FIRST GROUP INCLUDES SCORES OF ZERO ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR 
THE NEXT GROUP WOULD HAVE FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT AND NINE 
THE THIRD GROUP WOULD BE FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 
AND SO ON UNTIL WE END UP WITH NINE GROUPS 
TAKE THE FIRST SCORE OF THIRTY TWO THAT FALLS INTO THE THIRTY TO THIRTY FOUR GROUP 
IF WE WERE TO MAKE UP A TALLY CHART 
WE'D GIVE THIRTY TO THIRTY FOUR A TALLY COUNT OF ONE 
THE NEXT SCORE OF ELEVEN WOULD FALL INTO THE TEN TO FOURTEEN GROUP 
WHICH WOULD GET A TALLY COUNT OF ONE 
THIRTY FOUR WOULD ALSO COME UNDER THE THIRTY TO THIRTY FOUR GROUP 
SO THAT NOW GETS A TALLY COUNT OF TWO 
EVENTUALLY WE'D END UP WITH A CHART LIKE THIS 
SO TAKING THE ZERO TO FOUR GROUP 
IT HAS A TALLY COUNT OF ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
A CROSS FOR FIVE SIX AND SEVEN 
SO SCORES BETWEEN ZERO AND FOUR HAVE OCCURRED SEVEN TIMES 
OR THIS GROUP HAS A FREQUENCY OF SEVEN 
IF WE DID THIS FOR ALL THE GROUPS 
WE'D END UP WITH A FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION TABLE LIKE THIS 
LOOKING AT FIGURES IN A FREQUENCY TABLE IS ALL VERY WELL 
BUT OFTEN IT'S EASIER TO SEE PATTERNS OR TRENDS 
BY LOOKING AT A DIAGRAM LIKE A BAR CHART 
A BAR CHART IS A GRAPH WITH TWO AXES 
THE ITEMS IN THE SURVEY ARE LISTED ON ONE AXIS 
AND THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THEY OCCUR IS ON THE OTHER AXIS 
THE ACTUAL FREQUENCY OF EACH ITEM 
IS REPRESENTED BY THE HEIGHT OF EACH BAR 
TRANSLATING THE INFORMATION FROM OUR FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION TABLE 
WE REPRESENT THE GROUPS OF DATA ON THE X. AXIS 
THE SCORES OF THE FORTY PLAYERS IN DIFFERENT GROUPS 
AND THE Y. AXIS SHOWS 
THE FREQUENCY OR NUMBER OF TIMES THAT SCORES HAVE OCCURRED 
FROM THE TALLY CHART WE KNOW THE GROUP ZERO TO FOUR HAS A FREQUENCY OF SEVEN 
SO THE HEIGHT OF THAT BAR IS SEVEN 
THE GROUPS FROM FIVE TO NINE AND TEN TO FOURTEEN HAVE FREQUENCIES OF THREE 
SO THESE BARS GO UP TO THREE ON THE Y. AXIS 
THE GROUP FROM FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN GOES UP TO EIGHT BECAUSE ITS FREQUENCY IS EIGHT 
NOTICE THAT THE HEIGHTS OF THE BARS MAY VARY BUT THE WIDTH IS THE SAME 
BECAUSE IN BAR CHARTS THE INTERVALS ARE REGULAR 
ALONG THE X. AXIS WE HAVE THE NUMBER OF VISITS TO THE SCHOOL GYM 
ALONG THE Y. AXIS WE HAVE THE FREQUENCY 
SO WE CAN SEE THAT TWELVE OF GERRY'S CLASSMATES 
EITHER DIDN'T USE THE GYM OR USED IT ONLY ONCE 
FIVE CLASSMATES USED THE GYM TWO OR THREE TIMES 
EIGHT USED THE SCHOOL GYM FOUR OR FIVE TIMES 
THREE USED THE SCHOOL GYM SIX OR SEVEN TIMES 
AND TWO USED IT EIGHT OR NINE TIMES 
SO FOR PART A 
WE NEED TO ADD TOGETHER THE HEIGHTS OF EACH OF THE BARS 
WHICH IS THIRTY IN TOTAL 
PART B. ASKS 
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS 
WHO USED THE SCHOOL GYM SIX SEVEN EIGHT OR NINE TIMES SO THAT'S 
FINALLY PART C. SAYS 
WELL JILL SAYS OF GERRY'S CLASSMATES 
HAVE USED THE SCHOOL GYM AT LEAST ONCE 
THAT MEANS ONCE OR MORE THAN ONCE 
BUT 
SO JILL COULD BE WRONG 
SINCE WE DON'T KNOW IF ALL OF GERRY'S CLASSMATES 
HAVE USED THE SCHOOL GYM AT LEAST ONCE 
LET'S NOW LOOK AT A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE OF DATA HANDLING 
THIS IS GALLOP AND THEY SPECIALISE IN GATHERING DATA 
IT'S COMPANIES LIKE THIS WHO FIND OUT WHAT YOU AND I THINK ABOUT ANYTHING 
FROM POLITICS TO VIDEOS 
TO DO THIS THEY TALK TO A SAMPLE OF THE POPULATION 
EITHER BY RINGING THEM UP OR STOPPING THEM IN THE STREET 
AND THEN USE THE ANSWERS TO INTERPRET WHAT THE NATION THINKS AS A WHOLE 
BUT ANYONE CAN DO A SURVEY WITH A LITTLE PLANNING 
SO HOW DOES YOUR WORK HELP DESIGNERS 
WE MIGHT SAY LOOK AT PARTICULAR LOGOS 
THAT DESIGNERS WANT TO USE ON A PRODUCT 
AND WE'D HELP THEM USUALLY TO START WITH TO TEST HOW GOOD A LOGO IS 
DO PEOPLE LIKE IT DOES IT MEAN SOMETHING TO THOSE PEOPLE 
MATHS FILE IS GOING TO DO ITS OWN SURVEY 
LOOKING AT LOGO DESIGN 
IT'S THE SORT OF THING COMPANIES DO 
TO TEST HOW WELL THEY'RE DESIGNS ARE WORKING 
WE MIGHT HELP REFINE THE LOGO FOR THEM MAKE SOME CHANGES 
SO THAT IT'S MORE APPEALING ON THE PRODUCT IT'S USED ON 
I WANT TO DESIGN A SURVEY TO TEST THE MOST RECOGNISABLE SPORTS LOGO 
HOW WOULD I GO ABOUT DOING THAT 
O. K. WE'VE PUT THE FOUR MAIN LOGOS WE THINK PEOPLE MIGHT RECOGNISE 
DOWN THIS SIDE 
NOW WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO IS SAY 
LOOK AT TWO DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS 
SO HERE WE OUTLINE WHERE YOU MIGHT TALK 
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TEN TO TWENTY YEAR OLDS AND TO CONTRAST THEM 
TALK TO A GROUP WHO ARE THIRTY TO FORTY YEAR OLDS 
SO WE'VE GOT YOUNG PEOPLE AND MIDDLE AGED 
WE'D ALSO PROBABLY WANT TO SAY YOU SHOULD ALSO TALK 
TO SOME BOYS AND SOME GIRLS AND SOME MEN AND SOME WOMEN 
OUR SURVEY WILL LOOK AT WHETHER PEOPLE CAN IDENTIFY FOUR TRAINER LOGOS 
NIKE CONVERSE 
REEBOK AND ADIDAS 
WE'VE SPLIT THE SURVEY SHEET UP BY AGE AND SEX 
TO RECORD THE INFORMATION WE'RE GOING TO USE TALLY MARKS 
IF AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD BOY IDENTIFIED LOGO ONE NIKE 
WE'D MAKE A TALLY MARK IN THE TEN TO TWENTY MALE BOX 
FOR EVERY FIFTH PERSON WE PUT A STRIKE MARK ACROSS 
WHICH SHOWS A GROUP OF FIVE RECOGNISE THE LOGO 
IT ALSO MAKES ADDING UP EASIER 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD I NEED TO ASK I MEAN 
IDEALLY IF YOU HAD A LOT OF MONEY TO SPEND 
AND YOU WERE DOING A FULL SURVEY FOR THE BRITISH POPULATION 
IF YOU ASK ABOUT ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE 
YOU GET A VERY ACCURATE CROSS SECTION OF THE POPULATION 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE TAKING A SLICE OF THE PIE 
YOU DON'T NEED TO EAT THE WHOLE PIE TO KNOW WHAT'S IN IT 
YOU CAN TAKE A SMALL SLICE OF IT AND GET SOME MEN 
SOME WOMEN SOME YOUNG AND SOME OLD 
WITH A SURVEY LIKE THIS 
IF YOU JUST WANT TO GET AN IDEA OF WHETHER PEOPLE KNOW DIFFERENT LOGOS 
YOU CAN MAYBE DO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE 
IT WOULDN'T BE AS ACCURATE 
BUT IT WOULD GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHICH LOGOS PEOPLE KNOW 
WE HAVE FOUR LOGOS THERE 
AND FIRST I NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT AGE RANGE YOU'RE IN 
SYMBOL NUMBER ONE NIKE T. HAT'S R. I. G. HT 
WHAT'S THIS 
NOPE NOPE NOPE 
NUMBER THREE REEBOK 
NUMBER FOUR ADIDAS 
NUMBER TWO IS ERM ALL STARS 
CONVERSE ALL STARS 
NUMBER THREE NO AND NUMBER FOUR NO 
SYMBOL NUMBER THREE YEAH REEBOK 
ADIDAS FOUR OUT OF FOUR 
DO I WIN A PRIZE NO PRIZES HERE 
GOT FIVE IN NO TIME AT ALL 
BOTH MALE AND FEMALE AT THIS AGE RANGE FOR NIKE 
SO LET'S START ADDING THESE FIGURES UP O. K. I'LL GO FIRST 
SO THAT'S FIVE AND THAT'S TWO SO THAT MAKES SEVEN 
FIVE ONE THAT'S SIX 
SO WE'VE CARRIED OUT OUR SURVEY AND ADDED UP THE RESULTS 
BECAUSE WE ONLY TALKED TO ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE IT IS ONLY A GUIDE 
BUT SMALL SURVEYS ARE OFTEN USED BY POLLING COMPANIES 
TO SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING WORTH INVESTIGATING ON A LARGER SCALE 
WHAT MIGHT OUR FIGURES TELL US 
WE CAN PUT IT IN A WRITTEN FORM SO PEOPLE CAN READ ABOUT THE RESULTS 
RATHER THAN JUST LOOKING AT FIGURES 
HERE WE'VE GOT 
NUMBERS SHOWING HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU INTERVIEWED 
AND THEN HOW MANY PEOPLE WITHIN EACH OF THESE GROUPS 
RECOGNISED EACH OF THE LOGOS 
SO FOR INSTANCE WE KNOW EIGHTY PER CENT EIGHT OUT OF TEN MALES 
WHO ARE AGED TEN TO TWENTY RECOGNISED THE NIKE LOGO 
SO YOU CAN MAKE INTERESTING COMPARISONS 
BETWEEN THE DATA THAT WE'VE GOT 
THIS LOOKS A LITTLE CONFUSING 
IS THERE ANOTHER WAY TO INTERPRET THIS INFORMATION 
THERE'S ONE WAY WE CAN DO IT WHICH IS USING GRAPHICS 
PICTURES OF THE DATA 
RATHER THAN JUST WRITING THE FIGURES 
ON THE COMPUTER WE'VE LOOKED AT FIRST OF ALL 
WHAT WERE THE LEVELS OF AWARENESS FOR EACH LOGO 
THIS IS THE MOST SIMPLE THING WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT 
WHAT WE HAVE HERE ALONG THIS SIDE ARE THE NAMES OF THE LOGOS 
THAT WE HAD PEOPLE LOOK AT 
UP THIS SIDE WE'VE GOT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE 
WHAT PROPORTION ACTUALLY RECOGNISED THE LOGO 
SO IT ALLOWS US TO COMPARE ACROSS AND SAY 
MOST PEOPLE RECOGNISED NIKE SIXTY TWO PER CENT JUST OVER SIX OUT OF TEN PEOPLE 
THE LOWEST RECOGNITION WAS FOR CONVERSE 
NOT MANY PEOPLE WERE AWARE OF THAT ONLY TWENTY NINE PER CENT 
WHICH IS LESS THAN THREE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE 
AS WELL AS WORKING OUT THE MOST AND LEAST RECOGNISABLE LOGO 
ANDY CAN USE OUR RESULTS ON AGE AND SEX TO MAKE PIE CHARTS 
THIS CAN SHOW A COMPANY LIKE CONVERSE 
WHERE THEY'RE RECOGNITION PROBLEM MAY BE 
WHAT WE CAN SEE HERE IS THAT THE AWARENESS IS VERY LOW 
AMONG TEN TO TWENTY YEAR OLDS ONLY EIGHTEEN PER CENT 
IT'S MUCH HIGHER AMONGST THIRTY TO FORTY YEAR OLDS 
SO THE REAL STORY THERE 
IS IF CONVERSE WANT TO SELL MORE OF THEIR PRODUCTS TO YOUNGER PEOPLE 
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK ON RAISING AWARENESS AMONGST THAT GROUP 
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT PIE CHARTS 
A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT IN THIS LARGE BOYS' SCHOOL 
IT LOOKED AT THE FAVOURITE SPORTS OF A CLASS OF THIRTY TWO PUPILS 
AND THE TOP FOUR ACTIVITIES WERE 
THE SURVEY SHOWS THAT EIGHT PUPILS PREFERRED BASEBALL 
FOUR PREFERRED CRICKET FOUR PREFERRED RUNNING 
AND SIXTEEN PREFERRED TENNIS 
LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF PUPILS WHO PREFERRED EACH SPORT 
AS A FRACTION OF THE ENTIRE CLASS 
WE CAN SEE THAT BASEBALL REPRESENTS EIGHT OUT OF THE THIRTY TWO PUPILS 
CRICKET FOUR OUT OF THIRTY TWO 
RUNNING FOUR OUT OF THIRTY TWO 
AND TENNIS SIXTEEN OUT OF THIRTY TWO 
WE CAN THEN SIMPLIFY OR CANCEL THESE FRACTIONS 
AND SHOW THAT A QUARTER OF THE CLASS PREFERRED BASEBALL 
AN EIGHTH PREFERRED CRICKET 
AND EIGHTH PREFERRED RUNNING 
PREFERRED TENNIS 
NOW IF WE WANT TO SEE THIS DATA AS A DIAGRAM 
WE COULD REPRESENT THESE PROPORTIONS ON A PIE CHART 
NOW THIS IS EXACTLY AS IT SOUNDS IT'S A CHART IN THE SHAPE OF A PIE 
IF WE DIVIDE THE PIE UP ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS 
IT WILL LOOK LIKE THIS 
EACH SECTOR REPRESENTS A SPECIFIC PIECE OF DATA 
SO WORKING CLOCKWISE WE CAN SEE THAT 
A QUARTER OF THE CLASS'S FAVOURITE SPORT IS BASEBALL 
THAT TAKES UP A QUARTER OF THE CIRCLE 
THEN AN EIGHTH PREFER CRICKET ANOTHER EIGHTH PREFER RUNNING 
FINALLY THE FRACTION OF PUPILS WHO PREFERRED TENNIS IS A HALF 
SHOWN BY THE FINAL SEGMENT 
NOTICE THAT ALL THE FRACTIONS REPRESENTED BY A PIE CHART 
ADD UP TO ONE WHOLE OF A CIRCLE 
LOOK AT THIS INFORMATION 
PART B. 
THIS IS A PAPER TWO QUESTION SO YOU CAN USE A CALCULATOR 
THIS IS A PIE CHART QUESTION 
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT PIE CHARTS ARE ALL ABOUT ANGLES AND FRACTIONS 
WITH THE MAIN EMPHASIS IN THIS QUESTION ON FRACTIONS 
THE MAN EARNED SIXTEEN PER WEEK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX 
SO THE COMPLETE CIRCLE REPRESENTS SIXTEEN 
IN PART A YOU'RE ASKED HOW MUCH HE SPENT ON FOOD 
LOOK AT THE CHART AND THE SECTION ON FOOD 
IF YOU USE AN ANGLE MEASURER OR EVEN THE CORNER OF A PIECE OF PAPER 
YOU CAN TELL THAT THIS IS A RIGHT ANGLE 
WHICH MEANS THAT THE FOOD SECTION IS A QUARTER OF THE CIRCLE 
A QUARTER OF SIXTEEN IS FOUR SO HE SPENT FOUR ON FOOD 
IN PART B. YOU HAVE TO DRAW YOUR OWN PIE CHART 
TO REPRESENT THE FIGURES IN THE TABLE 
THIS TIME THE MAN SPENDS FOUR HUNDRED IN A WEEK 
SO THE WHOLE CIRCLE REPRESENTS FOUR HUNDRED 
RENT IS TWO HUNDRED THIS IS HALF OF FOUR HUNDRED 
SO HALF OF THE PIE CHART WILL BE RENT 
THERE ARE LITTLE TICK MARKS ON THE CIRCLE 
SO YOU CAN USE THEM TO DRAW HALF A CIRCLE OR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
HE SPENDS ONE HUNDRED ON FOOD 
THERE ARE FOUR ONE HUNDREDS IN FOUR HUNDRED SO FOOD MUST BE A QUARTER OF HIS SPENDING 
MARK A QUARTER OF THE CIRCLE ON THE DIAGRAM 
REMEMBER THAT THE ANGLE MUST BE NINETY DEGREES AT THE CENTRE 
HE SPENDS FIFTY ON ENTERTAINMENT THIS IS HALF OF WHAT HE SPENDS ON FOOD 
FOOD WAS NINETY DEGREES SO ENTERTAINMENT IS FORTY FIVE DEGREES 
THE LITTLE MARKS ON THE CIRCLE SHOULD BE ENOUGH 
FOR YOU TO DRAW FORTY FIVE DEGREES ACCURATELY 
AND FINALLY THERE IS FIFTY ON OTHER 
THIS IS THE SAME AS ENTERTAINMENT 
IF YOU'VE DRAWN THE OTHER CATEGORIES CORRECTLY 
THEN THIS SHOULD ALREADY BE DRAWN 
IT SHOULD BE THE SAME SIZE AS ENTERTAINMENT 
WHENEVER YOU DO PIE CHART QUESTIONS 
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CHECK WHAT THE WHOLE CIRCLE REPRESENTS 
AND CHECK THAT ALL THE ANGLES ADD UP TO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES 
IN THIS CASE WE HAD 
AND THEY ADD UP TO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES 
LET'S MOVE ON TO LINE GRAPHS 
LINE GRAPHS SHOW US HOW DATA CHANGES OVER INTERVALS OF TIME OR DISTANCE 
IF A STRAIGHT LINE CAN BE DRAWN THROUGH ALL THE POINTS PLOTTED 
WE SAY THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS LINEAR 
IF THE LINE CURVES 
THE RELATIONSHIP IS NON LINEAR 
THESE GRAPHS SHOW THE DEPTH OF WATER AS CONTAINERS FILL UP 
LET'S LOOK AT GRAPH ONE 
AT TWO SECONDS ON THE X. AXIS 
THE CONTAINER HAS FILLED TO A DEPTH OF FIVE C. M. 
WHEN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME HAS PASSED AGAIN 
AT FOUR SECONDS 
THEN IT'S FILLED TO THE DEPTH OF EIGHT C. M. 
AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AGAIN IT'S FILLED TO A DEPTH OF NINE 
SO ALTHOUGH THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME PASSES ON EACH OCCASION 
THE WATER IN THE CONTAINER FILLS AT A SLOWER AND SLOWER RATE 
THIS COULD BE BECAUSE THE CONTAINER IS GETTING WIDER 
NOW LOOK AT GRAPH TWO 
AT TWO SECONDS ON THE X. AXIS 
THE CONTAINER HAS FILLED TO A DEPTH OF THREE C. M. 
IN ANOTHER TWO SECONDS IT'S FILLED TO NEARLY FIVE 
IN THE SAME TIME AGAIN TO A DEPTH OF JUST OVER FIVE 
AND IN A FURTHER TWO SECONDS TO A DEPTH OF SEVEN C. M. 
WITH THIS GRAPH ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF TIME PASSING IS THE SAME 
THE DEPTH OF THE WATER SEEMS TO BE SLOWING DOWN FIRST OF ALL 
AND THEN GETS FASTER AGAIN 
THIS COULD BE BECAUSE THE CONTAINER IS WIDER AND THEN THINNER 
LIKE A GOLDFISH BOWL 
A LINE GRAPH IS ALWAYS TRYING TO ILLUSTRATE A RELATIONSHIP 
YOU JUST HAVE TO WORK OUT WHAT IT IS 
THE X. AXIS IS LABELLED TIME 
THE Y. AXIS IS LABELLED DEPTH OF WATER 
SO THE GRAPH SHOWS US HOW THE DEPTH OF WATER CHANGES OVER TIME 
SO HERE FROM A TO B. 
WE CAN SEE THAT THE DEPTH OF WATER 
IS INCREASING AT A STEADY RATE 
THEN FROM B. TO C. 
THE DEPTH IS STILL INCREASING 
BUT AT A SLOWER RATE 
FROM C. TO D. THE DEPTH STAYS THE SAME 
UNTIL FROM D. TO E. 
WE SEE A SUDDEN RISE IN THE DEPTH 
FROM E. TO F. THE DEPTH OF WATER STAYS THE SAME 
FROM F. TO G. THERE IS A STEADY DECREASE IN THE DEPTH OF WATER 
THEN A FASTER DECREASE FROM G. TO H. 
AND A SLOWER STEADY DECREASE FROM H. TO I 
PART A OF THE QUESTION TELLS US 
WHICH EXPLAINS THE STEADY RATE OF INCREASE IN THE DEPTH OF WATER 
THEN WE'RE ASKED WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING AT POINT B. 
WELL AT POINT B. THE DEPTH OF WATER IS STILL INCREASING 
BUT AT A SLOWER RATE 
THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS 
PART B. ASKS 
THAT'S WHERE THERE IS A SUDDEN RISE IN THE DEPTH OF WATER FROM D. TO E. 
SO NOW WE'VE SEEN HOW TO REPRESENT DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA 
LET'S MOVE ON TO COMPARING DATA 
LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE ENJOYING LUNCH AT THIS RESTAURANT 
THERE ARE TWO AREAS OF THE RESTAURANT 
THE MANAGER NEEDS TO ORGANISE HIS STAFF ROTA 
FOR SUMMER WEEKENDS AND BANK HOLIDAYS 
WHEN THE RESTAURANT GETS VERY BUSY 
HE WONDERS IF ON HOT DAYS 
HE SHOULD PUT WAITERS IN CHARGE OF MORE TABLES IN THE OUTDOOR AREA 
THAN IN THE INDOOR AREA OF THE RESTAURANT 
OR WHETHER EVEN IF IT'S HOT PEOPLE PREFER TO EAT INSIDE IN THE SHADE 
THE MANAGER ASKS ONE OF HIS STAFF TO COLLECT SOME DATA 
TO HELP HIM FIND OUT 
FIRST THE OUTDOOR RESTAURANT 
NOW LOOK AT THESE SCATTER DIAGRAMS 
AND SEE IF WE CAN MAKE SENSE OF THEM 
AS A STARTER IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO READ THE DESCRIPTION OR TITLE 
THIS ONE SAYS THE SCATTER DIAGRAM 
SHOWS THE TEMPERATURE AT MIDDAY IN DEGREES CENTIGRADE 
AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT MIDDAY IN THE OUTDOOR AREA 
FOR WEEKENDS AND BANK HOLIDAYS IN APRIL AND MAY 
LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THE VARYING TEMPERATURE 
AND THE VARYING NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUTDOORS 
LOOK AT THE PATTERN OF POINTS PLOTTED 
YOU CAN SEE THAT AS TEMPERATURE INCREASES 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE USING THE OUTDOOR AREA INCREASES 
WHEN ONE VARIABLE INCREASES AS ANOTHER INCREASES 
WE SAY THERE IS 
NOW THE INDOOR RESTAURANT 
THE OTHER SCATTER DIAGRAM 
SHOWS THE MIDDAY TEMPERATURES AND THE MIDDAY NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
IN THE INDOOR AREA OF THE RESTAURANT 
LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ALSO A RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THE VARYING TEMPERATURE AND THE VARYING NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
IN THIS AREA OF THE RESTAURANT 
LOOKING AT THE PATTERN OF POINTS PLOTTED 
YOU CAN SEE THAT AS THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE USING THE INDOOR AREA DECREASES 
WHEN ONE VARIABLE INCREASES AS ANOTHER DECREASES LIKE THIS 
WE SAY THAT THERE IS 
IF WE DRAW A STRAIGHT LINE THROUGH THE POINTS ON THIS SCATTER DIAGRAM 
WITH AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE ON THE LINE 
AND ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF POINTS THAT AREN'T ON THE LINE 
LYING EITHER SIDE OF IT 
THEN WE GET WHAT WE CALL THE LINE OF BEST FIT 
WE CAN USE THIS LINE OF BEST FIT TO MAKE SOME ESTIMATIONS 
WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS SIXTEEN C. AT MIDDAY 
WE CAN ESTIMATE THAT THERE WILL BE TEN PEOPLE IN THE INDOOR AREA 
WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS TWENTY ONE C. 
THEN WE CAN ESTIMATE THERE WILL BE FOUR PEOPLE IN THE INDOOR AREA 
THE WAITRESS DID A COUNT OF PEOPLE IN THE INDOOR AND THE OUTDOOR AREAS 
OF THE RESTAURANT AT SIX P. M. 
LET'S LOOK AT THAT DATA AND SEE IF IT TELLS US A DIFFERENT STORY 
THIS SCATTER DIAGRAM SHOWS THE SIX P. M. TEMPERATURES 
AND THE SIX P. M. COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE INDOOR RESTAURANT 
ON WEEKENDS AND BANK HOLIDAYS IN APRIL AND MAY 
NOTICE THERE DOES NOT REALLY SEEM TO BE A PATTERN OF PLOTTED POINTS 
SO HERE WE SAY THERE APPEARS TO BE 
FOR PART A LET'S LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
THE HEIGHT AND MASS OF HORSES 
WE CAN SEE FROM THE PLOTTED POINTS 
THAT AS THE HEIGHTS OF THE HORSE INCREASE 
SO DO THEIR MASSES 
AND THE UPWARD SLOPE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT 
OF THE LINE OF BEST FIT CONFIRMS THIS 
WE CAN SAY 
FOR PART B. 
WE HAVE TO ESTIMATE THE MASS OF THE HORSE BY USING THE LINE OF BEST FIT 
FOR A HEIGHT AT ONE SIXTY THREE C. M. 
LOOK AT THE HEIGHT AXIS 
THAT'S THE HORIZONTAL AXIS 
AND READ OFF FROM THIS 
YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE TEN C. M. 
BETWEEN ONE FORTY C. M. AND ONE FIFTY C. M. 
AND ONLY FIVE SQUARES 
SO EACH SQUARE ALONG THIS HORIZONTAL AXIS 
REPRESENTS TWO C. M. 
SO A HORSE OF HEIGHT ONE SIXTY THREE C. M. 
WOULD READ HERE 
LET'S DRAW A LINE UP FROM ONE SIXTY THREE C. M. 
TO THE LINE OF BEST F. IT 
NOW ALONG TO THE VERTICAL AXIS THAT SHOWS THE MASS OF THE HORSE 
WE CAN SEE THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED K. G. 
BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED K. G. AND SIX HUNDRED K. G. 
AND ONLY FOUR SQUARES 
SO EACH SQUARE ALONG THIS VERTICAL AXIS 
REPRESENTS TWENTY FIVE K. G. 
OUR LINE COMES TO HERE 
WHICH IS MORE THAN FIVE SEVENTY FIVE K. G. 
AND LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED K. G. 
SO USING OUR LINE OF BEST FIT 
WE WOULD PROBABLY ESTIMATE THAT A HORSE OF ONE SIXTY THREE C. M. 
WOULD HAVE A MASS OF FIVE NINETY K. G. 
ANOTHER WAY OF COMPARING SEVERAL SETS OF DATA 
WOULD BE TO LOOK AT AVERAGES 
BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES OF AVERAGES 
THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES 
BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER TAKE A LOOK AT THIS 
HERE WE CAN SEE EALING TORNADOS BASKETBALL TEAM 
THEY'VE PLAYED WELL ON SOME DAYS AND NOT SO WELL ON OTHERS 
LET'S SUPPOSE THAT THE TEAM HAS PLAYED SIX GAMES 
ON ONE OCCASION THEY WON SIXTY TO TWELVE ON ANOTHER THEY WON FORTY FIVE TO TWELVE 
BUT IN ONE GAME THEY LOST FIFTEEN TO EIGHTY FOUR 
EALING TORNADOS ARE HOPING TO DO EVEN BETTER LATER IN THE SEASON 
AND THEY'RE HOPING TO ENCOURAGE THIS COACH TO TRAIN THEM 
KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THEIR PERFORMANCES 
SUPPOSE THE COACH WANTS TO MAKE SENSE OF THE DATA FOR THE SIX GAMES 
PLAYED SO FAR THIS SEASON 
TO FIND OUT HOW STRONG THE TEAM'S ATTACK IS 
HE COULD LOOK AT THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF POINTS 
THAT THEY'VE SCORED IN THE SIX GAMES 
TO FIND OUT HOW STRONG THEIR DEFENCE IS 
HE COULD LOOK AT THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF POINTS THEY'VE LET IN 
THAT'S THE SCORES OF THOSE TEAMS 
THEY'VE PLAYED AGAINST IN THE SIX GAMES 
A COMMON TYPE OF AVERAGE IS THE MEAN 
SO IF WE LOOK AT THE MADE UP SCORES OF THE EALING TORNADOS WE ADD UP 
AND THEN DIVIDE THEM BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF GAMES THAT'S SIX 
THIS COMES TO THIRTY THREE 
LET'S SEE HOW THE OPPONENTS FARED 
AND LEARN MORE A BIT MORE ABOUT THE MEAN 
THE MEAN IS A TYPE OF AVERAGE AND IT SHOULD BE TYPICAL OF THE DATA SET 
THE VALUE OF THE MEAN 
SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE SET 
LET'S WORK OUT THE MEAN SCORE FOR THE OPPONENT'S TEAM 
WE'VE GOT 
WE ADD THOSE UP AND THAT GIVES US A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR 
WE DIVIDE THAT BY THE NUMBER OF SCORES ON THE LIST SIX 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR DIVIDED BY SIX GIVES US AN ANSWER OF TWENTY NINE 
SO THE MEAN SCORE FOR THE OPPONENT'S TEAM IS TWENTY NINE 
ALTHOUGH THE MEAN SCORE WAS CORRECTLY WORKED OUT TO BE TWENTY NINE 
THAT'S A BIT DECEIVING IF WE LOOK AT THIS CHART HERE 
IN FIVE OUT OF THEIR SIX GAMES THEY SCORED LESS THAN TWENTY NINE 
VICTORIA PARK SCORED TWENTY EIGHT 
OSNEY TOWN SCORED TWELVE 
PERCH UNITED SCORED TWENTY SIX 
TWELVE A N. D. TWELVE 
ONLY IN ONE GAME DID THEY ACTUALLY SCORE MORE THAN TWENTY NINE 
SO TO SAY THAT THEY HAD AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY NINE IS A LITTLE BIT DECEIVING 
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT IN THIS GAME HERE 
WHERE THEY SCORED EIGHTY FOUR 
THAT SCORE HAS DISTORTED THE MEAN AVERAGE FOR THE OPPONENTS 
SO YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE MEAN 
THE EALING TORNADOS SCORED TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY EIGHT FIFTEEN AND FORTY FIVE 
TO FIND THE MEDIAN AVERAGE WE PUT ALL THE SCORES IN ORDER OF SIZE 
STARTING WITH THE SMALLEST TO THE LARGEST OR LARGEST TO THE SMALLEST 
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
WE'RE GOING TO ORDER THEM FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST 
ONCE WE'VE DONE THAT 
WE NEED TO FIND THE MIDDLE VALUE THE MIDDLE OF THESE SIX VALUES HERE 
THAT FALLS BETWEEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH VALUE 
TWENTY EIGHT AND TWENTY EIGHT WHICH MEANS THE MEDIAN SCORE IS TWENTY EIGHT 
LET'S CHANGE ONE OF THE TWENTY EIGHTS TO A TWENTY SEVEN 
AGAIN WE HAVE TO FIND THE MIDDLE VALUE OF THESE SIX VALUES HERE 
THIS TIME IT FALLS BETWEEN TWENTY SEVEN AND TWENTY EIGHT 
SO THE MEDIAN IS HALFWAY BETWEEN THESE TWO VALUES 
THAT MAKES IT A MEDIAN SCORE OF 
LET'S SAY THE EALING TORNADOS PLAYED A SEVENTH GAME 
AND HAD A WINNING SCORE OF SIXTY THREE 
WE'D HAVE TO ADD THAT TO OUR LIST HERE SIXTY THREE 
AGAIN WE WANT TO FIND THE MIDDLE VALUE 
THIS TIME IT FALLS EXACTLY ON THE FOURTH VALUE TWENTY EIGHT 
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE 
WE'VE GOT ONE TWO THREE LESS 
AND ONE TWO THREE MORE 
SO THAT GIVES US A MEDIAN AVERAGE OF TWENTY EIGHT 
FINALLY LET'S LOOK AT THE MODE 
IN THIS CASE THE SCORE THAT OCCURS MOST OFTEN 
LET'S LOOK AT THE MODAL AVERAGE FOR THE EALING TORNADOS 
THAT'S THE SCORE THAT OCCURRED THE MOST OFTEN 
THEY SCORED TWENTY EIGHT TWICE SIXTY ONCE TWENTY TWO ONCE FIFTEEN ONCE AND FORTY FIVE ONCE 
SO THE SCORE THAT OCCURS THE MOST OFTEN IS TWENTY EIGHT 
THEREFORE THE MODAL AVERAGE FOR THE EALING TORNADOS IS TWENTY EIGHT 
LET'S LOOK AT THE SCORES FOR THE OPPONENTS OF THE EALING TORNADOS 
THEY SCORED TWENTY EIGHT ONCE 
TWELVE THREE TIMES 
TWENTY SIX ONCE AND EIGHTY FOUR ONCE 
SO THE SCORE THAT OCCURS MOST OFTEN IS TWELVE 
THEREFORE THE MODAL AVERAGE AGAINST THE EALING TORNADOS IS TWELVE 
TO FIND THE MEDIAN PLACE ALL THE QUANTITIES IN SIZE ORDER 
AND THEN FIND THE MIDDLE ONE 
IF THERE ARE TWO IN THE MIDDLE 
TAKE THE VALUE THAT IS HALFWAY BETWEEN THE TWO 
SOMETIMES THE MEAN MEDIAN OR MODE 
IS NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION ON ITS OWN 
SO TO BACK UP AN AVERAGE 
YOU MIGHT FIND THE RANGE TOO 
THE RANGE SHOWS OUT HOW SPREAD THE VALUES ARE 
IN THIS CASE WOULD SHOW THE COACH 
HOW CONSISTENTLY THE TEAM IS PLAYING 
LET'S LOOK AT THE RANGE OF SCORES FOR THE EALING TORNADOS 
THEIR HIGHEST SCORE WAS SIXTY THEIR LOWEST FIFTEEN 
SO THE RANGE IS SIXTY SUBTRACT FIFTEEN 
WHICH EQUALS FORTY FIVE 
LET'S LOOK AT THE RANGE OF SCORES 
FOR THE OPPONENTS OF THE EALING TORNADOS 
THEIR HIGHEST SCORE WAS EIGHTY FOUR THEIR LOWEST TWELVE 
SO THE RANGE IS EIGHTY FOUR SUBTRACT TWELVE 
WHICH EQUALS SEVENTY TWO NOW IF WE TAKE THIS INFORMATION 
OF THE RANGE BEING SEVENTY TWO 
A LARGE RANGE 
ALONG WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT 
THE MODAL AVERAGE FOR THE OPPONENTS IS TWELVE 
WE SEE THAT IN GENERAL 
THE TORNADOS DON'T LET OPPONENTS SCORE VERY HIGHLY 
BUT ON ONE OCCASION THEY HAVE 
IF THERE'S A QUANTITY IN THE DATA SET 
THAT IS A LOT BIGGER THAN THE REST 
OR A LOT SMALLER THAN THE REST 
THE MEAN MIGHT MISREPRESENT THE DATA 
SO IT MAY BE BEST TO USE A DIFFERENT AVERAGE 
FOR EXAMPLE IN JANUARY THE TEMPERATURE RANGES 
FROM SEVENTEEN DEGREES CENTIGRADE TO TWENTY FOUR DEGREES CENTIGRADE 
PART A ASKS 
PART B. SAYS 
THE QUESTION BEGINS WITH AN EXPLANATION OF THE GRAPH 
WHICH SAYS THAT IT SHOWS THE RANGE IN TEMPERATURE IN MIAMI EACH MONTH 
WE ARE ASKED WHICH MONTH MIAMI HAS THE SMALLEST RANGE OF TEMPERATURE 
THIS WILL BE REPRESENTED BY SHORTEST BAR 
WHICH APPEARS TO BE SEPTEMBER 
WHERE THE RANGE IS FROM TWENTY SIX DEGREES TO THIRTY DEGREES 
A RANGE OF THIRTY SUBTRACT TWENTY SIX FOUR DEGREES 
FOR PART B. WE ARE ASKED WHICH ARE 
THE FIVE MONTHS OTHER THAN JULY WHEN THE TEMPERATURE RANGE IS FIVE DEGREES 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR MONTHS WITH A TEMPERATURE RANGE OF FIVE DEGREES 
WE WERE TOLD THAT IN JANUARY THE TEMPERATURE RANGES 
FROM SEVENTEEN DEGREES TO TWENTY FOUR DEGREES 
SO THAT'S A RANGE OF TWENTY FOUR SUBTRACT SEVENTEEN THAT'S SEVEN DEGREES 
IN FEBRUARY WE CAN SEE THAT THE RANGE IS BIGGER THAN SEVEN DEGREES 
BECAUSE THE BAR IS EVEN LONGER THAN JANUARY'S BAR 
IN MARCH THE TEMPERATURE RANGES FROM NINETEEN DEGREES TO TWENTY FIVE DEGREES 
SO THAT'S A RANGE OF TWENTY FIVE SUBTRACT NINETEEN WHICH IS SIX DEGREES 
THEN IN APRIL THE TEMPERATURE RANGES FROM TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY SEVEN DEGREES 
SO THAT'S A RANGE OF TWENTY SEVEN SUBTRACT TWENTY ONE WHICH IS ALSO SIX DEGREES 
IN MAY THE TEMPERATURE RANGES FROM TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY NINE DEGREES 
SO THAT'S A RANGE OF TWENTY NINE SUBTRACT TWENTY FOUR WHICH IS FIVE DEGREES 
WE HAVE FOUND OUR FIRST MONTH OTHER THAN JULY 
WITH A RANGE IN TEMPERATURE OF FIVE DEGREES 
IN JUNE THE TEMPERATURE RANGES FROM TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY DEGREES 
SO THAT'S A RANGE OF THIRTY SUBTRACT TWENTY FIVE WHICH IS ALSO FIVE DEGREES 
WE WERE TOLD THAT JULY HAS A TEMPERATURE RANGE OF FIVE DEGREES 
SO LET'S MOVE ON TO AUGUST 
IN AUGUST THE TEMPERATURE RANGES FROM TWENTY SIX TO THIRTY TWO DEGREES 
SO THAT'S A RANGE OF SIX DEGREES 
WE HAVE ALREADY WORKED OUT 
THAT SEPTEMBER HAD THE SMALLEST RANGE OF FOUR DEGREES 
SO LET'S MOVE ON TO OCTOBER 
IN OCTOBER THE TEMPERATURE RANGES FROM TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY NINE DEGREES 
WHICH IS ANOTHER MONTH WITH A TEMPERATURE RANGE OF FIVE DEGREES 
IN NOVEMBER THE TEMPERATURE RANGES FROM TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY SIX DEGREES 
YET ANOTHER MONTH WITH A TEMPERATURE RANGE OF FIVE 
AND FINALLY DECEMBER 
THE TEMPERATURE RANGES FROM NINETEEN DEGREES TO TWENTY FOUR DEGREES 
A FIVE DEGREE RANGE AGAIN 
SO THE FIVE MONTHS OTHER THAN JULY 
WHEN THE RANGE IN TEMPERATURE IS FIVE DEGREES 
ARE MAY 
JUNE 
OCTOBER 
NOVEMBER 
AND DECEMBER 
THAT'S IT FOR THIS SECTION ON HANDLING DATA 
IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND 
JUST GO BACK AND TAKE ANOTHER LOOK 
THIS SECTION IS ABOUT PROBABILITY 
WE USE WORDS LIKE 
TO DESCRIBE IT THESE WORDS CAN BE PUT ON A SCALE 
IMPOSSIBLE IS AT ONE END OF THE SCALE 
SOMETHING THAT CANNOT EVER HAPPEN 
CERTAIN IS AT THE OTHER END OF THE SCALE 
SOMETHING THAT WILL DEFINITELY HAPPEN 
HALFWAY ALONG THE SCALE IS EQUALLY LIKELY 
SOMETHING WHICH IS AS LIKELY TO HAPPEN AS NOT 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS 
IN TODAY'S STREET MATHS WE'RE USING A PROBABILITY LINE 
I'M GOING TO SAY A STATEMENT AND YOU'VE GOT TO SAY 
IF IT'S CERTAIN OR IF IT'S EVENS 
OR IMPOSSIBLE OR VERY VERY UNLIKELY 
IT'S GOING TO BE BRILLIANTLY SUNNY ALL DAY 
I SAID IT'S GOING TO BE BRILLIANTLY SUNNY ALL DAY 
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO BE 
I THINK IN TRUE BRITISH FASHION 
WHO PUT THAT ARROW THERE WHO SAID IT'S LIKELY ONE PERSON 
LOOK THIS LADY THINKS IT'S GOING TO BE BRILLIANTLY SUNNY 
DON'T YOU LOVE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT GIVE HER A ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
BACK TO THE PROBABILITY LINE 
I HAVE A STRAIGHT PACK OF CARDS EXCEPT THEY'RE BIGGER THAN NORMAL 
THE MAIN THING IS THEY'RE SHUFFLED 
WHEN I PICK THE TOP CARD THE TOP CARD WILL BE RED 
RIGHT LET ME SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT 
AND YOU'VE TRUSTED ME THAT IT'S A FAIR PACK OF CARDS GOOD ON YOU 
AND YOU'VE SAID THAT IT'S AN EVENS CHANCE THE TOP CARD WILL BE RED 
IN A NORMAL PACK OF CARDS TO SAY IT'S EVENS IS REASONABLE 
WHO WANTS TO TURN OVER THE CARD 
IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A BLACK CARD IT WAS AN EVEN CHANCE 
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THE CHANCE OF IT BEING EITHER RED OR BLACK 
TAKE THAT CARD HOLD THAT THERE AND PICK ANY OTHER CARD YOU LIKE 
O. K. AND HOLD THAT THERE WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM 
HE'S HOLDING TWO CARDS WHAT ARE THE CHANCES HE HAS A MATCHING PAIR 
PUT YOUR ARROWS ON THE PROBABILITY LINE 
THERE'S LOADS OF MATCHING PAIRS IN A PACK OF CARDS 
YOU'VE ALL SAID IT'S UNLIKELY 
YOU HAVEN'T SAID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS POSSIBLE 
YOU COULD HAVE GOT TWO BLACK SEVENS BUT NO ONE HAS SAID IT'S CERTAIN 
DO YOU RECKON YOU'RE ALL HAPPY WITH YOUR ANSWER YES 
DO WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT TWO CARDS HE'S PICKED YES SHOW US 
HAVE YOU GOT A MATCHING PAIR 
SOME OF YOU ARE LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT COULD BE A TRICK 
DOES ANYBODY TRUST ME NO I WON'T TRY AND BORROW MONEY OFF YOU 
IF YOU'D KNOWN ABOUT THE PACK OF CARDS YOU'D HAVE BEEN CERTAIN 
THE WORDS ON THAT SCALE GIVE US A ROUGH INDICATION OF CHANCE 
BUT WE CAN USE A MUCH MORE ACCURATE MEASURE A NUMBER 
A PROBABILITY 
PROBABILITY IS MEASURED AS A FRACTION OR A DECIMAL FROM ZERO TO ONE 
SO THE PROBABILITY SCALE NOW GOES FROM IMPOSSIBLE AT ZERO 
TO CERTAIN AT ONE 
EQUALLY LIKELY IS MIDWAY AT OR OH FIVE 
TODAY IS TUESDAY 
WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY OF TOMORROW BEING SUNDAY 
WE KNOW THAT SUNDAY NEVER FOLLOWS TUESDAY SO THE PROBABILITY IS ZERO 
WE WRITE THAT AS 
ON THE OTHER HAND 
WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY OF TOMORROW BEING WEDNESDAY 
THAT'S ONE BECAUSE WEDNESDAY ALWAYS FOLLOWS TUESDAY 
SO WE'D WRITE THAT AS 
THERE IS A WAY OF WORKING OUT THE PROBABILITY OF AN EVENT HAPPENING 
WITHOUT HAVING TO ACTUALLY COUNT ALL THE OPTIONS 
HERE ARE THREE CUPS AND ONE MARBLE 
WE HAVE TO GUESS WHICH CUP THE MARBLE IS UNDER 
WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY OF MAKING THE CORRECT CHOICE 
THERE IS ONE CORRECT CHOICE THE CUP WITH THE MARBLE UNDER IT 
AND THREE POSSIBLE CHOICES ALL THREE CUPS 
THE PROBABILITY OF MAKING THE CORRECT CHOICE IS 
THE NUMBER OF CORRECT CHOICES ONE 
DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE CHOICES THREE 
THAT'S ONE OVER THREE ONE THIRD 
LET'S MAKE THE GAME MORE COMPLICATED 
NOW WE HAVE TEN CUPS AND THREE MARBLES HIDDEN UNDERNEATH 
SO WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY OF PICKING A MARBLE THIS TIME 
THERE ARE THREE CORRECT CHOICES 
THE CUPS WITH THE MARBLES UNDER THEM 
AND TEN POSSIBLE CHOICES ALL TEN CUPS 
WHICH IS ALSO EQUAL TO OH THREE 
NOW LET'S LOOK AT HOW TO REPRESENT THE PROBABILITY 
OF TWO EVENTS HAPPENING TOGETHER LIKE TOSSING TWO COINS 
WITH TWO OUTCOMES AT THE SAME TIME LIKE TOSSING TWO COINS 
OR THROWING TWO DICE 
OR TOSSING ONE COIN AND THROWING ONE DICE AT THE SAME TIME 
WE CAN RECORD OUR POSSIBLE OUTCOMES 
ON A SAMPLE SPACE DIAGRAM LIKE THIS ONE HERE 
SO WE COULD HAVE IF WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF TOSSING TWO COINS 
WE COULD HAVE A HEAD AND A HEAD 
A HEAD AND A TAIL 
A TAIL AND A TAIL 
A TAIL AND A HEAD 
SO THERE ARE FOUR POSSIBLE OUTCOMES 
IF I WANT TO FIND THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING TWO HEADS 
THAT WOULD BE 
ZERO POINT ONE OUT OF FOUR 
NOW IF I WANT TO FIND 
THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING A HEAD AND A TAIL 
I'VE GOT THE CHANCE OF GETTING A HEAD AND A TAIL HERE 
THAT'S ONE 
A TAIL AND A HEAD HERE 
THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING A HEAD AND A TAIL OR A TAIL AND A HEAD 
IS TWO OUT OF FOUR 
AND I CAN REDUCE THAT DOWN TO 
SO THROWING A HEAD AND A TAIL 
IS TWICE AS LIKELY AS THROWING TWO HEADS OR TWO TAILS 
BUT WHAT ABOUT A COIN AND A DICE 
IF WE THROW A FAIR DICE AND TOSSED ONE COIN AT THE SAME TIME 
THE COMBINATIONS WOULD BE 
A TAIL AND A ONE 
A TAIL AND A TWO AND SO ON 
UP TO A TAIL AND A SIX 
AND A HEAD AND A ONE 
UP TO A HEAD AND A SIX 
SO THERE ARE TWELVE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES 
THIS MEANS THAT THE PROBABILITY OF THROWING A HEAD AND A THREE 
IS THE NUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES ONE 
DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES IN THIS CASE TWELVE 
WHICH IS ONE TWELFTH 
IF THE PROBABILITY OF AN EVENT HAPPENING IS ZERO THEN IT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
IF THE PROBABILITY OF AN EVENT HAPPENING IS ONE THEN IT IS CERTAIN 
THE PROBABILITY THAT AN EVENT 
IS AS LIKELY TO HAPPEN AS IT IS NOT TO HAPPEN IS OR OH FIVE 
THE PROBABILITY OF AN EVENT HAPPENING 
IS THE NUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES 
WE WANT TO HAPPEN DIVIDED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES 
THE PROBABILITY OF AN EVENT HAPPENING 
PLUS THE PROBABILITY OF THE SAME EVENT NOT HAPPENING IS ALWAYS ONE 
EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER IT OFFERS A CHOICE OF 
THE QUESTION SAYS 
AND IN PART A IT TELLS ME THAT 
IT THEN ASKS 
WELL I KNOW THE PROBABLITY OF AN EVENT HAPPENING 
PLUS THE PROBABILITY OF IT NOT HAPPENING ALWAYS ADDS UP TO ONE 
SO IF THE PROBABILITY THAT I WILL THROW A DOUBLE SIX IS ONE THIRTY SIXTH 
THE PROBABILITY I WILL NOT THROW 
A DOUBLE SIX MUST BE ONE MINUS ONE THIRTY SIXTH 
WHICH IS THIRTY FIVE THIRTY SIXTHS 
WE CAN CHECK THIS BY DRAWING A TABLE 
THAT LISTS ALL THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES 
OF THROWING TWO DICE 
THERE ARE A TOTAL OF THIRTY SIX DIFFERENT THROWS 
AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS A DOUBLE SIX 
SO THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING A DOUBLE SIX IS ONE OUT OF THIRTY SIX 
THERE ARE THIRTY FIVE THROWS WHICH ARE NOT A DOUBLE SIX 
SO THE PROBABILITY OF NOT THROWING A DOUBLE SIX IS THIRTY FIVE OUT OF THIRTY SIX 
PART B. TELLS ME 
THAT I THROW ONE DOUBLE SIX AND THEN THROW THE DICE AGAIN 
IT ASKS ME TO TICK THE BOX THAT DESCRIBES THE PROBABILITY 
THAT I WILL THROW DOUBLE SIX THIS TIME 
THE FACT THAT I THROW A DOUBLE SIX THE FIRST TIME DOES NOT AFFECT 
THE PROBABILITY OF THROWING A DOUBLE SIX THE NEXT TIME 
THE DICE ARE EXACTLY THE SAME 
AND THE PROBABILITY OF THROWING A SIX REMAINS THE SAME 
SO THE PROBABILITY WILL STILL BE ONE THIRTY SIXTH 
PART C. ASKS 
LET'S USE OUR TABLE OF THROWS AGAIN 
THERE IS ONE WAY OF THROWING A DOUBLE THREE 
OUT OF A TOTAL OF THIRTY SIX POSSIBLE THROWS 
SO THE PROBABILITY OF THROWING A DOUBLE THREE 
IS ONE THIRTY SIXTH 
THE FINAL PART ASKS 
USING OUR TABLE WE CAN SEE THERE ARE SIX WAYS OF GETTING A DOUBLE 
ONE AND ONE TWO AND TWO THREE AND THREE AND SO ON 
UP TO SIX AND SIX 
SIX OUT OF THIRTY SIX THROWS ARE DOUBLES 
SO THE PROBABILITY IS SIX THIRTY SIXTHS 
YOU CAN SIMPLIFY THIS IF YOU WANT 
TO ONE SIXTH 
WELL THAT'S IT FOR PROBABILITY 
IT'S ALSO THE END OF THIS KEY STAGE THREE BITESIZE MATHS REVISION PROGRAMME
