POSSIBLE MEMBER GEORGIA HAS TWO 
BREAK AWAY REGIONS WITH LARGE 
RUSSIAN REGIONS IT HAS ACCUSED 
TENSIONS THERE ON TUESDAY IT WAS 
SENDING EXTRA PEACEKEEPING TROOPS 
IN GEORGIA BECAUSE RUSSIA HAD 
PLANS OF ATTACK IT IS A DANGEROUS 
PLAN OF ATTACK 
THIS AREA A SMALL BEAUTIFUL 
SLITHER OF LAND SAND WICHED BETWEEN 
RUSSIA AND GEORGEA NOW A FLASH 
POINT CAUSING MOUNTING 
INTERNATIONAL CONCERN TENSIONS 
FLARED WHEN GEORGIA RELEASED THIS 
VIDEO CLAIMING IT SHOWED A RUSSIAN 
FIGHTER SHOOTING DOWN ONE 
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT RUSSIA 
DENIES IT SINCE THEN BELLICOSE 
RHETORIC HAS TURNED INTO ACTION 
WITH MOSCOW ANNOUNCING IT IS 
INCREASING ITS PEACEKEEPING FORCE 
IN THE REGION IT ALREADY HAS TWO THOUSAND 
TROOPS ON THE GROUND THE THE 
RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER HAD TO 
PROTECT THE PEOPLE WHAT HE CLAIMED 
THREAT OF MILITARY ACTION BY 
GEORGIA TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE 
SEPARATIST REGION MOSCOW SAYS IN 
THE REMOTE GORGE IN THE NORTH OF 
THE COUNTRY INTERESTS BEEN A MAJOR 
BUILD UP OF GEORGIAN TROOPS 
INCLUDING SPECIAL FORCES AND HEAVY 
ARMOUR POISED TO ATTACK BUT THE 
GEORGIAN GOVERNMENT DENIES THIS 
AND INSTEAD ACCUSES RUSSIA OF 
TRYING TO PROVOKE A CONFLICT 
RUSSIA IS TRYING TO DESTABILISE THE 
SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY THE MAIN 
GOAL OF RUSSIA IS NOT TO ALLOW US 
TO BE A SUCCESS STORY NOT TO ALLOW 
US TO CONTINUE OUR MOVEMENT TO THE 
DIRECTION OF NATO AND TO THE 
DIRECTION OF EUROPE 
TODAY NATO 
ITSELF LASHED OUT AT MOSCOW 
PARTICULAR LEVER ON THE DECISION TO 
INCREASE THE RUSSIAN PEACEKEEPING 
CONTINGENT 
THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION CONTINGENT HAS SAID THAT IT IS AUTHORISED I 
HAVE SEEN IN THE STATEMENTS WITHIN 
THE LIMITS SET OUT BY ITS C. I. S. 
MANDATE TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF 
PEACEKEEPING TROOPS THAT IS 
TECHNICALLY THE CASE BUT IN 
REALITY IN THE POLITICAL REALITY 
THIS IS NOT EASING TENSIONS IT IS 
RAISING TENSIONS 
EVER SINCE THE 
BLOODY CIVIL WAR IN THE EARLY 
NINETEEN NINETY S. WHICH LED TO GEORGE A BEING 
BROKEN WAY A THERE'S MEDDLING IN 
BIG POWERS TO THE EAST AND WEST 
NOW THE PEOPLE MUST BE AWARE ONCE 
AGAIN TENSIONS ARE COMING TO AHEAD 
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE 
SITUATION CAN BE CALMED DOWN IN 
TIME JOINING ME LIVE FROM 
TBILISI IS GEORGIA'S PRIME MINISTER 
LADO GURGENIDZE PRIME MINISTER 
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO RUSSIA'S 
ACCUSATION THAT YOU HAVE BEEN 
BUILDING UP TROOPS ON THE BORDER 
WITH ABKHAZIA 
GOOD EVENING WELL 
THAT IS A FALSE ACCUSATION VERY 
CLEARLY THE MISSION THAT HAS 
RECENTLY SURVEYED THE UPPER 
ABKHAZIA REGION THE PRECISE REGION 
WHERE THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN 
CLAIMING SUCH A BUILD UP HAS BEEN 
FOUND HAS FOUND NO EVIDENCE WHAT 
WHAT EVER GEORGIA HAS BEEN 
COMMITTED TO THE PEACEFUL 
RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT AND TO 
THE PEACEFUL REINTEGRATION OF OUR 
PROVINCES OF ABKHAZIA AND SOUTH 
OSSETIA THE PRESIDENT UNVEILED A 
COMPREHENSIVE AND MODERN TWENTY FIRST 
CENTURY EUROPEAN IF YOU WILL 
PEACE PLAN WITH A WIDE RANGING 
INCENTIVES WITH A PROMISE OF FREE 
ECONOMIC ZONE THE PROMISE OF A 
VICE PRESIDENTCY FOR THE ABKHAZIA 
LEADER AND PRESENTATION AMOUNTING 
TO A VETO RIGHT ON ANY MATTERS THE 
FEDERAL LEVEL THAT AFFECT ABKHAZIA 
THIS IS NOT A NEW PROPOSAL 
YOU CAN 
CONFIRM THERE'S BEEN NO BUILD UP OF 
GEORGIAN TROOPS IN ANY WAY NO 
CHANGE IN TROOPS NUMBERS 
THAT IS 
CORRECT I EMPHATICALLY CONFIRMED 
THAT GEORGIA IS IN THE MIDDLE OF 
AN ECONOMIC MIRACLE WE HAVE 
GROWING OUR HAND OVER FIST LAST 
YEAR IT WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR PER CENT WE ARE TAKING IN 
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF FOREIGN 
INVESTMENT LAST YEAR TO THE TUNE 
OF FIFTEEN PER CENT OF G. D. P. YEAR BEFORE THAT 
FOURTEEN PER CENT WE FINISHED THE BEST FOREIGN 
INVESTMENT INFLOWS WE WOULD BE 
POSITIVELY INSANE TO WISH ANY 
MILITARY CONFLICT AT THIS TIME 
BUT YOU DO HAVE A PROBLEM IN 
ABKHAZIA BECAUSE MOST OF THE 
PEOPLE THERE DON'T WANT TO BE PART 
OF GEORGIA THEY WANT TO BE PART OF 
RUSSIA THEY HAVE RUSSIAN PAST 
PORTS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET 
AROUND THAT PROBLEM 
YOU'RE QUITE 
RIGHT THAT WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM IN 
ABKHAZIA BUT LET'S GO TO THE ROOTS 
OF THE PROBLEM AND DEFINE IT 
PROPERLY THE PROBLEM WITH ABKHAZIA 
IS THAT BEFORE THE HOSTILITIES OF 
NINETY TWO AND NINETY THREE THAT POPULATION OF 
CLOSE TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CURRENTLY 
ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
ESTIMATES THERE'S ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
LIVING THERE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND TOPS IT 
REMAINS AND HAS BEEN FOR THE PAST 
FIFTEEN YEARS UNFORTUNATELY A SEVERELY 
DEPOPULATED ETHNICALLY CLEANSED 
AREA FROM WHICH ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
ETHIC GEORGIANS GREEKS ESTONIANS 
JEWS RUSSIANS ET CETERA WERE 
DRIVEN OUT IN WHAT WAS ONE OF THE 
MOST UNFORTUNATE CASES OF 
WIDESPREAD ETHNIC CLEANSING AND 
MASS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONNESS NINETY TWO 
AND NINETY THREE YOU'RE RIGHT WE HAVE A 
PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE 
CURRENT PEACEKEEPING FORMAT THAT 
HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN 
YEARS HAS NOT MANAGED TO ALLOW AND 
FOSTER AND FACILITATE THE DIGNIFIED 
AND PEACEFUL AND SAFE RETURN OF ALL 
THOSE DISPLACED PERSONS WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT ALMOST HALF A MILLION 
PEOPLE 
SO I MEAN RUSSIA IS PEOPLE RATCHETING UP THE TENSION YOU 
WOULD SAY BY ANNOUNCING IT WILL 
INCREASE ITS TROOP PRESENCE IN THAT 
AREA AREA SORRY PRIME MINISTER CAN YOU HEAR 
ME I THINK HE MIGHT BE CAN YOU 
HEAR ME I'M TERRIBLY SORRY HELLO 
PRIME MINISTER I THINK WE HAVE 
LOST GEORGIA'S PRIME MINISTER

THE ROOMS TO BE FOUND IN A VERY OLD BUILDING FULL OF 
LITTLE CORNERS LITTLE CREVICES 
INSIDE ARE DEEP CELLAR AND WE COME 
TO THIS VERY OMINOUS ENTRANCE AFTER 
YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH FIVE 
DIFFERENT ROOMS 
ELIZABETH FRITZL

AROUND THE CLOCK IN THIS 
PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC IN AMSTETTEN 
HERE THEY'RE SLOWLY GETTING 
ACCUSTOMED TO THEIR FREEDOM 
E. YESTERDAY WE HAD A LITTLE IMPROVISED BIRTHDAY PARTY 
FOR THE TWELVE YEAR OLD SON WITH A 
LITTLE BIRTHDAY CAKE AND EVERYBODY 
WAS IN ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THAT THE 
MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY TALK A LOT 
WITH EACH OTHER THAT IS CLEAR 
AFTER SUCH A LONG SEPARATION 
THEY'RE VERY HAPPY TO BE TOGETHER 
AGAIN AND OF COURSE SOME OF THEM 
SEE EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME 
DO THE AUSTRIAN 
AUTHORITIES POLICE SOCIAL 
SERVICES ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR HAVING ALLOWED THIS CRIME TO GO 
UNNOTICED FOR A QUARTER OF A 
CENTURY CENTURY 
THE RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION SO FAR SHOWS VERY 
CLEARLY THAT THE ACCUSED HAS TO BE 
SEEN AS A PERSON WHO ACTED ALONE 
AS THE INVESTIGATION PROCEEDS A 
PROFILE OF JOSEF FRITZL'S LIFE IS 
EMERGING HE WAS BORN IN AMSTETTEN 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE TO NINETY SIX HE RAN A 
GUEST HOUSZ WITH HIS WIFE SHE 
LOOKED AFTER THE OPERATION IN THE 
SUMMERS LEAVING HIM AT HOME 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HE GOT PLANNING PERMISSION

NETWORK OF UNDERGROUND WINDOWLESS 
ROOMS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR HE FORCED ELIZABETH 
INTO THE CELLAR HAVING BEEN 
SELECTED AS HIS VICTIM SHE HAD 
SEVEN CHILDREN ONE DIED SHORTLY 
AFTER BIRTH 
POLICE SAY THEY MAY CHARGE FRITZL 
OVER THE CHILD'S DEATH AND 
FRITZL'S NEIGHBOURS STILL SAY THEY 
SUSPECTED NOTHING THIS BAKE VERY 
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO JOSEF FRITZL 
HOUSE HOUSE 
HE WAS ALWAYS WELL DRESSED WHEN HE CAME IN THE SHOP 
WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEWS THE 
WEATHER HE SEEMED LIKE A NORMAL 
PERSON 
TODAY POLICE DECLARED THE PERSON CASE OF A SECRET DUNGEON SOLVED 
BUT THEY'VE PROMISED TO EXAMINE 
EVERY ASPECT OF JOSEF FRITZL LIFE 
TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE 
COMMITTED HIS CRIME ELIZABETH 
FRITZL IS SAID TO BE WEAK AND PALE 
AFTER HER TWENTY FOUR YEARS SPENT IN THE 
CELLAR HER ELDEST DAUGHTER 
KIRSTEN REMAINS IN A COMA IN THE 
LOCAL HOSPITAL DOCTORS DON'T 
EXPECT HER CONDITION TO IMPROVE 
SOON BUT SAY THEY'LL DO ALL THEY 
CAN TO SAVE HER LIFE THE NEWS FROM 
THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS NOT AS BAD 
AS PREDICTED THE FIGURES OUT TODAY 
CLAIM IT GREW BY OH SIX PER CENT WHICH IS 
WEAK BUT BETTER THAN EXPECTED ANY 
MINUTE NOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE 
THE U. S. STRA BANK WILL ANNOUNCE 
WHETHER IT IS CUTTING INTEREST 
RATES AGAIN TO STIMULATE THE 
WORLD'S BIGGEST ECONOMY WE WILL GO 
LIVE TO NEW YORK FOR THAT 
ANNOUNCEMENT BUT FIRST ADAM 
BROOKES LOOKS AT THE SORRY STATE OF 
THE U. S. HOUSING MARKET THE NUMBERS 
TELL US THAT AMERICA'S NOT IN 
RECESSION NOT QUITE BUT THE 
HOUSING MARKET'S A DISASTER 
MORTGAGES ARE VERY HARD TO COME BY 
THE NUMBER OF HOMES BEING 
REPOSSESSED HAS DOUBLED IN THE LAST 
YEAR NOW OF EVERY ONE HUNDRED HOMES 
THREE ARE SITTING EMPTY 
IF A CRIME 
DOES OCCUR WE CAN KIND OF CHECK 
THE VACANT HOUSES 
FOR THE POLICE 
HERE IN FAIRFAX COUNTY THAT'S A 
WORRY 
ON THIS PARTICULAR HOUSE WE WORRY WERE GETTING COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE 
CONDITION OF THE YARD WHEN IT WAS 
LEFT THE VEHICLES TWO VEHICLES 
WERE LEFT HERE 
THE FAMILY THAT 
LIVED HERE FLED WHEN THEIR HOME WAS 
REPOSSESSED NOW THE NEIGHBOURS ARE 
WORRIED VACANT PROPERTIES ATTRACT 
CRIME 
HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING CRIME IN THEM OR UPKNIVES ARE IN THERE 
USING MARIJUANA WE MADE DRUG 
ARRESTS IN SOME 
SO WHEN A HOUSE 
LIKE THIS ONE GETS REPOSSESSED AND 
STARTS FALLING INTO DISREPAIR IT 
CAN START TO AFFECT THE ENTIRE 
NEIGHBOURHOOD BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS 
TO BUY A NEW HOME NEXT TO AN 
EYESORE LIKE THAT SO HOUSE PRICES 
ALONG THE ENTIRE STREET BEGIN TO 
FALL AND THAT'S HOW THE MORTGAGE 
CRISIS IS STARTING TO AFFECT ENTIRE 
COMMUNITIES SO MANY REPOSSESSED 
HOMES ARE ON THE MARKET BUYERS CAN 
TAKE BUS TOURS TO VIEW THEM ALL 
WHILE MANY AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE 
SEEING THE VALUE OF THEIR HOMES 
FALL THEY'RE SEEING THE COST OF 
FOOD AND FUEL GO UP AND UP 
AMERICANS ARE EXTREMELY NERVOUS 
PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY IN CONSTRUCTION OR 
RETAIL ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR 
FUTURE EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE A 
MORTGAGE THAT'S IN TROUBLE BUT 
MORE THAN THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT 
IN ONE OF THOSE SECTORS WHEN YOU 
LOOK AT FINANCIAL CONTRACTIONS 
MAKING IT HARD FOR COMPANIES TO 
EXPAND AND THE RIPPLE EFFECTS YOU 
WILL SEE FROM THESE THINGS 
EVERYONE IS WORRIED AMERICA'S AMERICA'S CENTRAL BANK THE FEDERAL RESERVE 
IS EXPECTED TO CUT INTEREST RATES 
AGAIN TODAY NOT BY MUCH PERHAPS 
ONE QUARTER OF A PER CENT IT IS 
ONE MORE EFFORT TO SPARK AMERICA'S 
ECONOMY BACK INTO LIFE 
WELL I'M JOINED BY OUR BUSINESS 
CORRESPONDENT IN NEW YORK MICHELLE 
FLEURY ARE WE STILL WAITING FOR 
THAT ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE FEDERAL 
RESERVE 
IN THE LAST FEW SECONDS RESERVE THAT DECISION HAS COME THROUGH THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE HAS DECIDED TO CUT 
INTEREST RATES BY TWENTY FIVE BASIS POINTS 
BRINGING THE COST OF BORROWING DOWN 
PRIOR TO THIS DECISION WE HAVE 
ALREADY SEEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE 
CUTS CUT THREE TIMES SINCE MID 
SEPTEMBER THIS IS A LONG LINE OF 
CUTS SINCE THE U. S. ECONOMY BEGAN TO 
SLOWDOWN 
WHAT KIND OF EFFECT DO SLOWDOWN YOU THINK IT'LL HAVE ON THE U. S. 
ECONOMY WILL IT HAVE THE DESIRED 
EFFECT I GUESS I'M ASKING WELL WELL THESE THINGS WILL TAKE A BIT OF 
TIME BEFORE THEY START FEED THROUGH 
TO THE BROADER COME THE FEDERAL 
RESERVE LED BY BEN BERNANKE THEY 
WILL BE HOPING THEY ACTED SWIFTLY 
CUTTING EARLY AND QUICKLY AND TWICE 
ACTING OUT OF THE ORDINARY MEETING 
TIMES NOW THIS WILL TAKE SEVERAL 
MONTHS BEFORE IT STARTS IF YOU 
LIKE FILTERING DOWN TO THE ECONOMY 
BUT THEY ARE HOPING IT'LL PROVIDE 
ENOUGH STIMULUS SO THEY MAY NOT 
HAVE TO DO MANY MORE CUTS AHEAD 
BUT OBVIOUSLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 
TO WAIT AND SEE AS WE SAW WITH THE 
LATEST GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT 
FIGURES FROM AMERICA CONSUMERS ARE 
BEGINNING TO SPEND LESS AS THINGS 
BEGIN TO BITE 
WE KEEP ON HEARING 
ABOUT RISING PRICES FOOD PETROL 
AND SO ON HOW WORRIED IS THE FED 
ABOUT INFLATION 
INDEED THE FEDERAL 
RESERVE HAS A TRICKY BALANCING ACT 
ON THE ONE HAND THEY ARE TRYING TO 
STIMULATE GROWTH ON THE OTHER HAND 
THEY ARE TERRIBLY WORRIED ABOUT 
INFLATION THIS HAS LED TO 
ARGUMENTS AMONGST THOSE ON THE FED 
OPEN MARKETS COMMITTEE BASICALLY 
THEY DISAGREE THERE ARE THOSE WHO 
ARE MORE WORRIED ABOUT INFLATION 
WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE 
THOSE WHO ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT 
GROWTH THIS HAS BEEN THE DEBATE 
AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE DEBATE 
MOVING FORWARD AS TO WHETHER WE SEE 
MORE RATE CUTS IT'S BASICALLY RATE 
CUTS WILL HELP STIMULATE THE 
ECONOMY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY 
CAN ALSO BE BAD NEWS FOR THE FED'S 
JOB OF TRYING TO CONTROL INFLATION 
SO DEFINITELY WATCH THIS SPACE TO 
SEE BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY VERY 
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN 
IN TERMS OF THE RECENT HIGHER OIL 
AND FOOD PRICES WHICH ARE TAKING 
THEIR TOLL ON CONSUMER'S SPENDING 
HABITS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH HABITS LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE 
DAY'S OTHER NEWS HOSPITAL 
OFFICIALS IN SADR CITY DISTRICT OF 
BAGHDAD SAY UP TO FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN KILLED IN THE PAST MONTH OF 
FIGHTING BETWEEN SHI'ITE GUNMEN AND 
THE U. S. AND IRAQI FORCES TWO PEOPLE 
WERE REPORTED TO HAVE DIED TODAY 
AFTER A PRIMARY SCHOOL WAS 
DESTROYED BY AN AMERICAN MISSILE 
SADR CITY HAS SEEN FIERCE FIGHTING 
SINCE THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT IS 
TRYING TO DISARM SHIA MILITIA 
MEMBERS MEMBERS OF A BEGUN'S SECURITY FORCES SAY 
THEY HAVE KILLED AT LEAST THREE OF 
THE INSURGENTS INVOLVED IN SUNDAY'S 
ATTACK ON PRESIDENT KARZAI THREE 
POLICEMEN WERE ALSO KILLED DURING 
THE GUN BATTLE IN THE CAPITAL KABUL 
THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE SAYS SIX 
OTHER SUSPECTS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED 
THE SWISS CHEMIST WHO DISCOVERED 
THE HALLUCINOGENIC DRUG L. S. D. HAS 
DIED AT THE AGE OF ONE HUNDRED TWO ALBERT 
HOFFMAN FIRST ENCOUNTERED THE 
SUBSTANCE IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT WHILE STUDYING 
MEDICAL USES FOR A FUNGUS FOUND ON 
WHEAT L. S. D. BECAME A POPULAR DRUG 
AMONGST HIPPIES IN THE SIXTIES 
ZIMBABWE'S PRESIDENTAL ELECTION MAY 
BEGIN THE PROCESS OF CHECKING THE 
MUCH AWAITED PROCESS OF CHECKING 
THE RESULTS TO BUT TONIGHT THERE 
IS A FLURRY OF CLAIMS ABOUT WHETHER 
THE M. D. C.'S MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WON 
ENOUGH VOTES TO AVOID A SECOND RUN 
OFF ROUND AGAINST PRESIDENT ROBERT 
MUGABE SINCE THE B. B. C. IS NOT 
ALLOWED TO REPORT FROM ZIMBABWE 
I'M JOINED BY OUR CORRESPONDENT IN 
JOHANNESBURG JOHANNESBURG WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE ABOUT THE 
REPORTS THAT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
MIGHT HAVE WON BUT NOT BY QUITE 
ENOUGH 
WELL IT IS VERY DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON 
HERE REMEMBER ALL WE HAVE AT THE 
MOMENT IS A COUPLE OF UNSOURCED 
QUOTES FROM GOVERNMENT SOURCES AND 
FROM WITHIN THE ZIMBABWE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION SUGGESTING THAT MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI HAS NOT WON ENOUGH VOTES 
TO WIN THIS ELECTION OUTRIGHT HE 
WON SOMETHING LESS THAN FIFTY PER CENT 
ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
SPEAKING TO REUTERS MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI GOT FORTY SEVEN PER CENT TO FORTY THREE PER CENT FOR 
MUGABE THE FRENCH NEWS AGENCY IS 
QUOTING ELECTORAL OFFICIALS SAYING 
PERHAPS HE GOT AROUND FORTY EIGHT PER CENT BUT 
EITHER WAY THE ELECTORAL OFFICIALS 
SAY THAT OFFICIALLY ONLY THEY CAN 
RELEASE THE FIGURES THEY ARE 
CALLING PARTY REPRESENTIVES TO 
THEIR OFFICES TOMORROW AT TWO HUNDRED TO 
BEGIN THE VERIFICATION PROCESS THE 
OPPOSITION HAS SAID THAT IT HAS 
ALSO HEARD THOSE RUMOURS BUT THE 
OPPOSITION HE SPOKESMAN WHO I WAS 
SPEAKING TO SAID AS FAR AS THEY ARE 
CONCERNED ALL OF THIS IS SIMPLY AN 
ATTEMPT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO 
PREPARE THE COUNTRY FOR A RUN OFF 
VOTE WHICH THE M. D. C. BELIEVES IS 
BLATANTLY UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THEY 
BELIEVE THEY WON THIS OUTRIGHT WE WE HAVE HEARD SIMILAR CLAIMS COMING 
FROM GOVERNMENT SOURCES BEFORE 
HAVEN'T WE A FEW DAYS AFTER THE 
ELECTION THERE WAS A SIMILAR 
REPORT 
WELL THE GOVERNMENT HAS REPORT NEVER REALLY FORMALLY SPOKEN ABOUT 
THIS THE GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN HAS 
SAID HAS REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE 
REPORTS SAYING ALSO IT IS UP TO 
THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION AND 
REMEMBER THE GOVERNMENT ALSO 
ACCUSED THE M. D. C. OF TRYING TO 
UNDERMINE THE ELECTORAL PROCESS BY 
CLAIMING VICTORY BASED ON RESULTS 
THAT THEY HAD COLLECTED FROM 
POLLING STATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY 
IN CLAIMING THEY HAD WON THIS 
OUTRIGHT THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT 
WAS AN ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE THE 
WHOLE ELECTION PROCESS AND THAT THE 
M. D. C. AND THE REST OF THE WORLD MUST 
SIMPLY BE PATIENT 
IT SEEMS LIKE 
ONCE AGAIN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
TAKE ALL THESE RUMOURS WITH A PINCH 
OF SALT UNTIL WE GET THE DEFINITE 
RESULTS TOMORROW 
THAT'S RIGHT 
CLEAR BY THE M. D. C. BELIEVES ALL OF 
THIS DELAY HAS BEEN ABOUT ALLOWING 
THE GOVERNMENT THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
GET ACCESS TO THOSE PRESIDENTAL 
BALLOT PAPERS TO EFFECTIVELY FIX 
THE RESULTS TO STAFF THE BALLOTS 
AND TO MAKE SURE THERE IS A RUN OFF 
THEY ARE SAYING THE VIOLENCE THEY 
ARE CLAIMING THAT IS TAKING PLACE 
NOW IS ALL PART OF A GOVERNMENT 
CRACKDOWN DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE 
THE OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS TO STOP 
THEM FROM VOTING AND TO MICK SURE 
THE GOVERNMENT WINS THIS ELECTION 
BY HOOK OR BY CROOK THE GOVERNMENT 
INSISTS IT IS A LOAD OF LIES THE 
ONLY PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
VIOLENCE IS THE M. D. C. AND SO FAR THIS 
WHOLE ELECTION HAS BEEN RELATIVELY 
FREE AND FAIR 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WITH THE OLYMPIC TORCH BACK ON HOME 
SOIL THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES ARE 
HOPING THAT THE WORLDWIDE PROTESTS 
WHICH HAVE DOGGED THE RELAY ARE 
BEHIND THEM WITH 
THE GAMES 
CHINA HAS BEEN HOLDING CELEBRATIONS 
TO MARK THE MILESTONE BUT THE 
CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE 
CAREFUL NOT TO OVERDO ITS 
NATIONALIST FERVOUR 
A STAR STUDDED STAGE FOR THE 
UNVEILING OF BEIJING WELCOMES YOU 
THE SONG TO CELEBRATE ONE HUNDRED DAY 
COUNTDOWN TO THE OLYMPICS 
FOR THE CHINESE SOME MUCH NEEDED 
GLITZ ON A GAMES TARNISHED BY 
PROTEST 
THE BATTERED BUT STILL BURNING 
TORCH IS NOW BACK ON CHINESE SOIL 
MUCH TO THE RELIEF OF THE 
ORGANISERS IN HONG KONG THERE WAS 
VIRTUALLY NO DISRUPTION NO CHANCE 
FOR NATIONAL PRIDE TO BLOSSOM 
SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WENT BEFORE 
AS I SPEAK SOMEONE IS TRYING TO 
GRAB THE TORCH FROM THE BLUE PETER 
PRESENTER 
BY GIVING THE TORCH A PRESENTER TWENTY NATION OVERSEAS ODYSSEY BEIJING 
INADVERTENTLY ALOUD HUMAN RIGHTS 
PROTESTERS TO VENT THEIR FEELINGS 
CHINA LIED PEOPLE DIED FOR FOR MILLIONS OF CHINESE THESE PROTESTS 
LOOKED LIKE A PLOT TO UNDERMINE 
THEIR COUNTRY'S MOMENT OF GLORY 
AND CHINESE INTERNET SITES ARE FULL 
OF RESENTMENT AT WESTERN CRITICISM 
IN THIS POEM THE STUDENT SAYS 
WHATEVER WE DO WE FIND SOMETHING 
TO CRITICISE AND NOTHING WE DO CAN 
PLEASE YOU INITIALLY WHEN WE CHOSE 
COMMUNISM THEN OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T 
LIKE THIS NOW WE HAVE EMBRACED 
MARKET ECONOMY AND EVERYTHING AND 
THEN YOU SAY NOW WE ARE TOO 
CAPITALIST SIMILARLY WHEN WE WERE 
CLOSED WE WERE CRITICISED FOR NOT 
EMBRACING THE MARKET NOW WE ARE 
VERY OPEN TRADING WITH PEOPLE 
THEN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT THE TRADE 
DEFICIT AND WE TAKE JOBS AWAY 
THESE SENSITIVITIES HAVE DEEP ROOTS 
THE CHINESE ARE TAUGHT THAT BEFORE 
MAU THERE WAS A CENTURY OF 
HUMILIATION BY FOREIGNERS DURING 
THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION ANYTHING 
WESTERN WAS DESPISED THOSE 
SUSPECTED OF FOREIGN LINKS WERE 
PUNISHED PUNISHED PEOPLE OF THE WORLD UNITE AND 
DEFEAT THE U. S. AGGRESSORS COMMUNISM COMMUNISM WAS GUN TO BE DISMANTLED IN THE 
NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND CHINA OPEN TO THE WEST 
BUT AS THE OLD IDEOLOGY DIED THE 
COMMUNIST PARTY HAS HAD TO 
LEGITIMISE ITSELF BY PROMOTING 
NATIONALISM SOMETIMES THAT TOO 
TURNS INTO FULL BLOWN XENOPHOBIA 
PASSIONATE PRO CHINA PROTESTS HAVE 
GROWN THROUGH THE TORCH'S JOURNEY 
THERE'S EVEN BEEN A BOYCOTT OF 
FRENCH PRODUCTS AFTER THE 
PARTICULARLY EMBARRASSING FIASCO IN 
PARIS BUT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
IS CAREFUL TO DISTANCE ITSELF FROM 
THESE OUTBURSTS 
IT DOES PROMOTE 
PATRIOTISM AND SEES IT AS A 
POSITIVE THING BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
GOVERNMENT IS ALSO WARY OF THE 
NATIONALIST SENTIMENTS GETTING OUT 
OF HAND SO AT THE SAME TIME IT 
ACTUALLY ALSO TRIES TO CONTROL THAT 
AND DOESN'T WANT THE NATIONALISTS 
FEELINGS TO JUST RUN WILD 
AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
CERTAINLY DOESN'T WANT IT TO RUN 
WILD IN AUGUST ANTI WESTERN 
FEELING COULD BE AS DISRUPTIVE TO 
THE OLYMPIC DREAM AS PRO TIBET 
PROTESTS WHEN THE WORLD'S MEDIA 
DESENDS ON BEIJING 
THIS IS WORLD NEWS TODAY 
AND THAT'S' ALL FROM THE PROGRAMME 
NEXT ON B. B. C. FOUR THE WEATHER WITH 
SUSAN POWELL BUT FOR NOW GOODBYE 
ALTHOUGH OUR WEATHER LOOKS LIKE IT 
WILL BEGIN TO GET QUIETER BY THE 
WEEKEND WE ARE NOT OUT 
IN TERMS OF HEAVY AND 
THUNDERY SHOWERS MORE FORECAST FOR 
TOMORROW TOMORROW IT IS THIS BIG AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
HERE THAT'S CAUSING THE WEATHER 
YOU CAN SEE IT DRIFTING FURTHER 
NORTH SO MUCH SO BY TOMORROW 
MORNING THE THICKEST CLOUD AND 
OUTBREAKS ARE RAIN A LIKELY TO 
AFFECT ENGLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
ENGLAND AND WALES NOT GETTING OFF 
TO TOO BAD A START BUT THEN THE 
SHOWERS ARE BACK AGAIN THEY MAY 
FORM IN BANDS SOME AREAS COULD SEE 
THEM RELENTLESSLY WHERE PERHAPS 
TOWARDS THE SOUTH COAST IT MIGHT BE 
A DRY AND BRIGHT AFTERNOON TO THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND NORTH OF 
LONDON SHARP SHOWERS THROUGH FROM 
THE WASH INTO THE MIDLANDS 
SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL TOTALS LIKELY 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON NORTHERN 
ENGLAND ALSO SEEING SOME ISOLATED 
SHOWERS BUT HOPEFULLY SOME DRIER 
SPELLS IN BETWEEN FOR SCOTLAND A 
LOT OF CLOUD IN GENERAL NOT MUCH 
BRIGHTNESS IN BETWEEN THE SHOWERS 
AND FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AN 
OVERCAST DAY THAT CENTRE QUITE 
CLOSE TO THE NORTH OF THE U. K. FOR 
WALES HOPEFULLY DECENT BRIGHTER 
SPELLS IN BETWEEN THE OUTBREAKS OF 
RAIN BY FRIDAY FINALLY THE LOW 
STARTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE U. K. AND 
YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF 
INFLUENCE FROM A RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE PUSHING INTO THE EAST FROM 
THE CONTINENT THAT'S WHAT WILL 
START TO CALM THINGS DOWN FOR THE 
WEEKEND BY FRIDAY IT LOOKS QUIETER 
THAN IT HAS DONE SO FAR
