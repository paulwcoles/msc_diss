THE FRENCH FINANCIER AND PHILANTHROPIST ALBERT KAHN 
BANKROLLED ONE OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS PROJECTS IN PHOTOGRAPHIC HISTORY 
DURING A PERIOD OF RISING INTERNATIONAL TENSIONS KAHN CREATED 
THE ARCHIVES OF THE PLANET A STOREHOUSE OF IMAGES 
THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE GREATER UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT 
FOR THE DIVERSE CULTURES OF THE WORLD 
KAHN DISPATCHED A TEAM OF PHOTOGRAPHERS TO MORE THAN FIFTY COUNTRIES 
WHERE THEY CAPTURED MANY EXTRAORDINARY IMAGES 
OF THE LIVES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE 
THEY ENCOUNTERED FISHERMEN BRAVING THE TREACHEROUS WATERS OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC 
THE IMPACT OF EUROPE'S IMPERIAL POWERS ON THE CULTURES OF NORTH AFRICA 
AND HE PRODUCED SOME OF THE EARLIEST COLOUR DOCUMENTARY FILMS 
PRESERVING THE VIBRANT CULTURAL LIFE OF FRANCE ITSELF 
THESE COMPELLING IMAGES GIVE US A UNIQUE INSIGHT 
INTO THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF ALBERT KAHN 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO A SHIP LEFT THE FRENCH PORT OF LE HAVRE TO JOURNEY 
THREE THOUSAND MILES ACROSS THE NORTH ATLANTIC 
ON BOARD WAS A CAMERAMAN WHO HAD BEEN SENT BY ALBERT KAHN ON A UNIQUE AND DANGEROUS MISSION 
THERE IS A FASCINATING NOTION 
IN A LOT OF KAHN'S WORK 
TO REACH PLACES THAT ARE REALLY FAR AWAY 
THAT NO ONE PERHAPS WAS ABLE TO REACH UNLESS THERE WAS A VERY GOOD REASON FOR DOING SO 
ONE WAS NEWFOUNDLAND WHICH WAS A BRITISH COLONY 
NOT PART OF CANADA UNTIL NINETEEN FORTY NINE IN WHICH THERE ARE TWO INDUSTRIES 
ONE IS TIMBER AND THE OTHER IS FISHING AND THAT'S IT 
THE FRENCH HAD OCCUPIED PARTS OF NEWFOUNDLAND SINCE THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
BY THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THEY ONLY HELD ON TO THE SMALL ISLAND OF SAINT PIERRE 
BUT THEY'D RETAINED LOCAL FISHING RIGHTS AND SO EVERY YEAR 
ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FRENCHMEN WOULD SPEND MONTHS IN THESE TREACHEROUS SEAS FISHING FOR COD 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO KAHN'S CAMERAMAN LUCIEN LE SAINT JOINED THE FISHERMEN 
HE KEPT A DETAILED DIARY OF HIS VOYAGE 
SATURDAY MAY SIXTH 
EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING 
THE WEATHER IS FINE NOW COMPLETELY CALM 
WE ARE TOTALLY SURROUNDED BY ICE 
WE'VE SEEN ICEBERGS TWO OR THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF OUR BOAT 
IT'S BOTH A WONDERFUL AND FRIGHTENING SIGHT 
LE SAINT WANTED TO FILM ALL ASPECTS OF THE FISHING PROCESS 
WHICH AT THIS TIME STILL INCLUDED THE USE OF THE ANCIENT TECHNOLOGY OF HOOK AND LINE 
AS FAR AS I'M AWARE THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE PIECE OF FILM 
WHAT WE CAN SEE IS REALLY 
A SYSTEM THAT DIED PROBABLY IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
SO WE'RE REALLY ON THE BRINK OF A DISAPPEARING AGE AS IT WERE 
AND THE WAY THEY FISHED IN THOSE TIMES WAS BY USING DORIES 
NOW EACH DORY IS LIKE A SAUCER 
IT CAN STACK ONE INSIDE THE OTHER IT HAS NO DECK 
EACH SCHOONER THAT CAME ACROSS FROM FRANCE 
WOULD HAVE PERHAPS TEN DORIES AND TWENTY FOUR MEN 
AND FROM THEIR DORIES THE MEN WOULD THEN THROW OUT THEIR HAND LINE 
THEN THEY BRING THE FISH BACK INTO THE MOTHER SHIP WHERE THEY ARE PITCHED BACK ON BOARD 
LUCIEN LE SAINT WAS THE IDEAL CHOICE FOR A MISSION AS GRUELLING AS THIS 
LE SAINT HAD ESTABLISHED A REPUTATION AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTREPID CAMERAMAN 
HE'D COVERED THE FIRST WORLD WAR HAD SPECIALISED 
IN AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY AND HAD TRAVELLED ALL OVER THE WORLD 
LUCIEN LE SAINT WAS WITHOUT A DOUBT 
THE MOST CINEMATIC OF KAHN'S CAMERAMEN 
AND THAT'S CLEAR IN HIS FRAMING IN THE TECHNICAL QUALITY OF THE IMAGES HE DELIVERED 
HE KNEW ALL THE TRICKS OF THE CAMERA 
AND WAS EXCELLENT AT HIS CRAFT 
HE WORKED WELL EVEN IN REALLY TOUGH SITUATIONS LIKE BEING OUT AT SEA 
SATURDAY MAY THIRTEENTH 
THESE MEN WORK LIKE SLAVES 
SOMETIMES THEY GET LOST IN THE FOG DRAGGED OFF BY THE CURRENTS 
WHICH TAKE THEM OUT OF SIGHT OF THEIR SHIP 
AND EVERY TIME WE SEE THAT HAPPENING 
IF THE WEATHER IS TERRIBLE IT'S GOODBYE TO THESE LITTLE BOATS 
THURSDAY MAY TWENTY FIFTH 
TODAY WE RESCUED TWO MEN WHO HAD BEEN LOST AT SEA FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS 
ONCE THEY'D BROUGHT THE COD ABOARD THE MEN STARTED PREPARING THE FISH 
BY GUTTING THEM AND STORING THEM IN SALTWATER 
MANY OF THE FISHERMEN WOULD SLEEP FOR JUST AN HOUR OR TWO A DAY 
THIS IS COLD WORK 
A MAN'S HANDS COULD FREEZE IN PERHAPS HALF AN HOUR OR SO 
BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO WORK IN THE FIDDLY CONDITIONS 
OF EITHER BAITING HOOKS OR GUTTING FISH IF YOU ARE WEARING GLOVES 
SO GENERALLY SPEAKING AS YOU CAN SEE IN THESE PICTURES PEOPLE HAVEN'T GOT PROTECTED HANDS AT ALL 
AND ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE DAMAGE THEY DID TO THEIR HANDS 
AFTER A SEASON OF FISHING IN THESE VERY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS 
JOINING THE FISHING FLEET WAS A HOSPITAL BOAT 
THE ONLY PLACE THE MEN RECEIVED ANY SORT OF MEDICAL ATTENTION 
THE DOCTOR WOULD PERFORM OPERATIONS OF EVERY KIND FROM TOOTH EXTRACTIONS TO AMPUTATIONS 
THE CONDITIONS WERE SUCH THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF DISEASE WAS EXTREMELY STRONG 
BUT ALSO THERE WERE INJURIES CAUSED PERHAPS BY PUNCTURE WOUNDS FROM FISH 
OR FROM KNIVES AND THESE WOULD BECOME VERY INFECTED IN THE FILTHY ENVIRONMENT OF FISH GUTTING 
AND WE ARE STILL TWENTY YEARS OFF ANTIBIOTICS AND SO THE ONLY WAY THE DOCTORS 
COULD DEAL WITH THESE APPALLING INJURIES WAS TO DRAIN THEM AS BEST THEY COULD AND HOPE FOR THE BEST 
THURSDAY MAY TWENTY FIFTH 
WE'VE SEEN QUITE A FEW SHIPS BRINGING WITH THEM ABOUT A DOZEN SICK MEN 
A LOT WITH LEG INJURIES FROM GETTING IN AND OUT OF THE DORIES 
BUT MOSTLY FOR INFECTED HANDS 
THE DOCTOR HAD TO DRAIN FIVE INFECTED WOUNDS TODAY AND TOMORROW HE'LL HAVE TO CUT OFF A MAN'S THUMB 
THE FISHERMEN STAY OUT HERE THREE OR FOUR MONTHS 
WITHOUT FRESH WATER TO WASH THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE SUPPLY IS LIMITED 
IT'S A TOUGH LIFE 
THE ONLY REFUGE FOR THE FRENCH FISHERMEN WAS THEIR COUNTRY'S 
LAST REMAINING COLONIAL OUTPOST HERE THE TINY ISLAND OF SAINT PIERRE 
IT'S STILL A DEPARTMENT OF FRANCE TO THIS DAY 
IT TRADES IN EUROS AND IMPORTS FOOD FROM THE MOTHER COUNTRY 
LE SAINT'S CAMERA OBSERVED THE LIVES OF THE ISLANDERS 
INCLUDING A MAN RIDING A CART POWERED BY A PAIR OF NEWFOUNDLAND DOGS 
WEDNESDAY JUNE FOURTEENTH 
WE ARRIVED AT SAINT PIERRE ON THE TENTH 
WE'VE SPENT FOUR DAYS HERE FOR SHIP REPAIRS 
I AM TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO FILM SOME GREAT VIEWS OF THE COASTLINE AND THE DRYING OF THE COD 
WHILE FILMING OFF NEWFOUNDLAND LE SAINT SAW THE FUTURE OF THE FISHING INDUSTRY 
STEAM ENGINED TRAWLERS USING HUGE NETS 
LE SAINT'S IMAGES OF THE NEW TRAWLERS 
SHOW THE ECLIPSE OF ANCIENT FISHING METHODS 
BY THE INDUSTRIAL SCALE EXPLOITATION OF THE SEAS 
THROUGHOUT HIS PROJECT KAHN WANTED TO SHOW HOW TRADITIONAL WAYS OF LIFE 
WERE BEING DISPLACED BY THE FORCES OF MODERNITY 
THIS PROCESS WAS RECORDED BY ONE OF KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS DURING VISITS 
TO THE FRENCH COLONIES OF NORTH AFRICA 
IN TUNISIA HE VISITED CITIES THAT ALREADY HAD EUROPEAN BUILDINGS 
AND TRANSPORT SYSTEMS 
AND IN MOROCCO 
WHICH HAD BECOME A PROTECTORATE OF FRANCE IN NINETEEN TWELVE 
HE FOUND NEW CITIES WERE RISING FROM THE SANDS 
WHAT THE FRENCH CALLED VILLES NOUVELLES HAD BEEN BUILT IN CASABLANCA 
AND RABAT AS PART OF A MODERNISATION PLAN 
DEVISED BY THE COLONIAL ADMINISTRATOR THE RESIDENT GENERAL MARSHAL LYAUTEY 
LYAUTEY LOOKED AT THE MODEL ELSEWHERE HE LOOKED AT WHAT THE BRITISH HAD DONE 
IN INDIA AND NIGERIA AND RULED THROUGH LOCAL LEADERS 
PEOPLE TENDED TO OBEY LOCAL RULERS WHERE THEY WOULD BE DIFFICULT WITH COLONIAL AUTHORITIES 
IT WAS ALSO QUITE A BIT CHEAPER 
BECAUSE IF YOU ACTUALLY KEEP THIS IDEA THAT THE COUNTRY 
IS STILL BEING RUN BY ITS TRADITIONAL RULERS YOU CAN TAX THE LOCAL PEOPLE 
IF YOU TAKE OVER WITH A FULLY COLONIAL AUTHORITY YOU HAVE TO FUND IT YOURSELF 
BUT BY THE TIME SAUVAGEOT TOURED THE COUNTRY IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX 
THERE WAS WIDESPREAD DISSATISFACTION WITH F. RE NC H. RULE 
IN STREET PERFORMANCES TRADITIONAL STORYTELLERS 
MOCKED LOCAL PEOPLE WHO COLLABORATED WITH THE FRENCH 
THEY USED TO TELL STORIES 
BUT ALSO JOKES AND FROM TIME TO TIME 
THEY VENTURED TO MAKE JOKES AT THE EXPENSE OF NATIVE AUTHORITIES 
I THINK THAT THESE PEOPLE TOOK PART IN AN IMPORTANT PHENOMENON 
NAMELY SHAPING COLLECTIVE MEMORY 
AND EVEN SHAPING NATIONAL IDENTITY INSOFAR THEY WERE TELLING NOT ONLY STORIES 
BUT PART OF HISTORY AND NOT ONLY MOROCCAN HISTORY BUT ISLAMIC HISTORY 
AND THESE STORIES FUELLED MOROCCAN PATRIOTISM AND NATIONALISM 
THROUGHOUT HIS JOURNEY SAUVAGEOT DOCUMENTED THE DAMAGING IMPACT OF FRENCH COLONIAL RULE 
ON THE LIVES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE IN MOROCCO 
I WAS INTERESTED IN PARTICULAR BY THE WAY PEOPLE WERE DRESSED 
THE GENERAL IMPRESSION WAS THAT PEOPLE WERE POOR 
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE IMPOVERISHMENT WHICH CAME AS A RESULT OF THE TAX BURDEN 
THESE PEOPLE HAD TO PAY HEAVY TAXES 
THEY HAD THEIR LAND CONFISCATED FOR THE BENEFIT OF FRENCH SETTLERS 
THE DESTITUTION CREATED BY FRENCH COLONIAL POLICIES FORCED MANY 
WITHIN THE RURAL POPULATION TO HEAD FOR THE CITIES 
SOME MOROCCAN WOMEN WERE SO DESPERATE 
THAT THEY TURNED TO PROSTITUTION 
THESE EXTRAORDINARY IMAGES 
WERE SHOT IN CASABLANCA'S SO CALLED SPECIAL QUARTER 
WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE FRENCH FOR YOUNG PROSTITUTES 
MOST OF THEIR CLIENTS WOULD BE FRENCH SOLDIERS 
AS THE COLONIAL POWER WANTED TO GUARD AGAINST THE SPREAD OF VENEREAL DISEASES 
THE WOMEN WERE FORCED TO ACQUIRE A DOCTOR'S CERTIFICATE 
TO LEAVE THE QUARTER 
PROSTITUTION IS NOW ILLEGAL IN MOROCCO 
AND TODAY SIGHTS LIKE THIS 
WOULD BE COMPLETELY UNIMAGINABLE 
AT THE TIME OF SAUVAGEOT'S VISIT MOST MOROCCANS WERE LIVING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
IN REMOTE MOUNTAIN VILLAGES IN THE NORTH OF THE COUNTRY HE SAW MOROCCAN WOMEN 
ENGAGED IN MORE CONVENTIONAL PURSUITS THAN THOSE HE'D WITNESSED IN THE CITIES 
THERE IS SOMETHING INTERESTING ALSO IN THE PICTURES THE MIXING BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN 
THIS WAS SOMETHING COMMON AT THE TIME 
WOMEN WERE PRESENT IN THE FIELDS 
DOING ALL SORTS OF DUTIES AND THEY HAD NOT TO VEIL 
NOWADAYS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ISLAMIST MOVEMENTS 
WOMEN HAVE THE VEIL AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MOROCCAN TRADITION IF YOU LIKE 
IT IS SOMETHING UP TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IMPORTED 
IN HIS IMAGES OF MOROCCO 
SAUVAGEOT PRODUCED A REVEALING VIEW OF LIFE IN THE COLONIAL WORLD 
TWO YEARS LATER KAHN GAVE HIM ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENT ONE MUCH CLOSER TO HOME 
AT ALBERT KHAN'S GARDENS IN BOULOGNE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF PARIS 
SAUVAGEOT TESTED OUT A BRAND NEW CINEMA TECHNOLOGY 
HE WAS FILMING MOVING IMAGES BUT THIS TIME IN COLOUR 
ONCE AGAIN ALBERT KAHN WAS AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF TECHNOLOGY 
A FEW YEARS BEFORE HOLLYWOOD PERFECTED TECHNICOLOR 
HIS TEAM WERE ALREADY USING FILM STOCK THAT REPRODUCED THE TRUE COLOURS OF NATURE 
THE PROCESS IN QUESTION WAS CALLED KELLER DORIAN BERTHON 
AND IT USED BLACK AND WHITE FILM 
THE FILM WAS EMBOSSED AND BECAUSE A SPECIAL LENS WAS USED 
BOTH IN THE FILMING AND IN THE PROJECTION 
THE FILM ONSCREEN WAS IN COLOUR 
TO SAUVAGEOT THE CITY OF PARIS PROVED TO BE AN IRRESISTIBLE SUBJECT 
FOR SHOWING OFF THE RICH POSSIBILITIES OF COLOUR 
IN A WAY I FIND THESE FILMS VERY MOVING 
BECAUSE I'VE SPENT YEARS LOOKING AT THE BLACK AND WHITE FILMS IN THE KAHN COLLECTION 
AND THE FIRST TIME I SAW CARS IN PARIS IN COLOUR IT CHANGED HOW I SAW THE PAST 
OF COURSE THAT'S HOW IT WAS IT WAS IN COLOUR NOT BLACK AND WHITE 
JUST AS BLACK AND WHITE FILM 
AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HAD STARTLED PEOPLE SO COLOUR WAS SOMETHING VERY NEW 
AND ALBERT KAHN TOOK HUGE DELIGHT IN SHOWING THESE FILMS TO HIS PRIVILEGED GUESTS 
ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE THEIR ASTONISHMENT AND PLEASURE IN SEEING THESE IMAGES 
AND EVEN THOUGH WE'RE USED TO SEEING THE WORLD IN COLOUR THESE IMAGES ARE STILL QUITE MAGICAL 
SOON KAHN'S TEAM TOOK THEIR CAMERA FURTHER AFIELD 
THEY TRAVELLED TO CAP MARTIN ON THE FRENCH RIVIERA 
WHERE THEY FILMED STUDENTS FROM A LOCAL ENGINEERING COLLEGE 
BATHING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN 
BUT HIS MOST REMARKABLE COLOUR PICTURES WERE SHOT 
IN THE DEEPEST REGIONS OF FRANCE THE PART OF THE COUNTRY KNOWN AS FRANCE PROFONDE 
THE NOTION OF DEEP DIVERSITY OF FRANCE AS SOMETHING OF AN EMPIRE IN WHICH THERE ARE NATIVE TRIBES 
IS SOMETHING OF WHICH KAHN WAS WELL AWARE HE WAS ALSATIAN BY BIRTH 
THAT ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CULTURE WAS PART OF HIS OUTLOOK 
IN NORTH WESTERN FRANCE THE CAMERA WAS TAKEN TO LOCRONAN 
IN BRITTANY TO FILM THE ANNUAL PILGRIMAGE TO COMMEMORATE 
SAINT RONAN WHO BROUGHT CHRISTIANITY TO THE AREA IN THE NINTH CENTURY 
DOWN THE COAST IN THE PORT OF CONCARNEAU 
KAHN'S TEAM OBSERVED TUNA FISHERMEN BRINGING IN THEIR CATCH 
IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE THEY FILMED THE COWBOYS WHO ROAM THE MARSHES OF THE CAMARGUE 
SINCE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THEY'VE RIDDEN THE LOCAL BREED OF WHITE HORSES AND RAISED THEIR CATTLE HERE 
ON THE SAME COAST KAHN'S CAMERA RECORDED A VERY SPECIAL OCCASION 
THE ANNUAL PILGRIMAGE TO SAINTES MARIES DE LA MER 
IT'S SAID THAT HERE MARY THE SISTER OF THE VIRGIN 
AND MARY THE MOTHER OF TWO APOSTLES LANDED ON THE FRENCH COAST 
ALONG WITH THEIR BLACK SERVANT GIRL SARA 
IT'S SARA WHO'S BECOME THE FOCUS OF THE CELEBRATION FOR GYPSIES 
WHO COME HERE FROM THROUGHOUT FRANCE SPAIN AND EASTERN EUROPE 
I WAS THRILLED TO SEE THIS FOOTAGE BECAUSE THERE IS VERY LITTLE 
DOCUMENTARY FILM ABOUT GYPSIES ANYWHERE IN EUROPE AT THIS TIME 
GYPSIES ARE FOR A WHOLE SERIES OF REASONS SUSPICIOUS 
AND IMMEDIATELY YOU SEE THAT THE FILM MAKERS HAVE GOT THROUGH THAT 
THAT THEY HAVE TRANSCENDED THE GAP BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THESE PEOPLE 
THIS ABILITY TO PRESENT THEMSELVES 
DESPITE THE FACT THEY'RE EXTREMELY POOR NOT JUST WITH APLOMB 
BUT WITH GRACE IS QUITE CLEAR 
EVEN THE LITTLE SHOTS OF THE TINY CHILDREN DANCING 
CAPTURES AN ELEMENT OF THAT 
THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS PILGRIMAGE IS THE GREAT PROCESSION WHEN STATUES OF THE SAINTS 
ARE TAKEN TO THE SEA TO BE BLESSED BY THE LOCAL ARCHBISHOP 
SIGNIFICANTLY IT'S THE GYPSIES WHO ARE GIVEN THE HONOUR 
OF CARRYING THE STATUES 
IT'S A MOMENT OF INCLUSION 
IT'S A MOMENT IN WHICH THE GYPSIES ARE TREATED AS EQUALS BY THOSE THEY LIVE AMONGST 
KHAN'S EXPERIMENT WITH COLOUR FILM HAD PRODUCED MANY CAPTIVATING IMAGES OF LIFE IN FRANCE 
IT'S CERTAIN HE WOULD HAVE ASKED HIS PHOTOGRAPHERS TO USE COLOUR FILM ON FUTURE OVERSEAS ASSIGNMENTS 
BUT WITHIN A YEAR EVENTS WOULD DELIVER A FATAL BLOW TO KAHN'S PLANS 
THE WALL STREET CRASH OF NINETEEN TWENTY NINE HAD BROUGHT DEPRESSION 
TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST ECONOMY THE UNITED STATES 
THE IMPACT OF THE CALAMITY SOON SPREAD TO EUROPE 
AND IT HAD A DRAMATIC EFFECT ON THE FINANCES OF ALBERT KAHN 
VERY QUICKLY ALBERT KAHN WAS PLUNGED INTO SPIRALLING DEBT 
WHICH EVENTUALLY LASTED SO LONG HE BECAME BANKRUPT 
BECAUSE OF THAT ALL HIS GOODS THAT IS TO SAY HIS PROPERTY IN BOULOGNE 
HIS OTHER PROPERTIES LIKE THE VILLA IN CAP MARTIN 
HIS FURNITURE AND HIS ART COLLECTION THEY WERE ALL PUT UP FOR AUCTION MAINLY IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX 
ALBERT KAHN'S PRIVATE GARDEN WHERE HE HAD DELIGHTED 
IN ENTERTAINING SO MANY EMINENT VISITORS WAS TURNED INTO A PUBLIC PARK 
HE WOULD WALK AMONGST THE TREES WHICH REMINDED HIM OF THE FOREST OF VOSGES FROM HIS CHILDHOOD 
AND WE HAVE A VERY MOVING SKETCH OF ALBERT KAHN WHICH WAS MADE JUST BEFORE HIS DEATH 
HE LED A SIMPLE LIFE AND HE STILL HAD HOPES FOR THE FUTURE 
WHEN HE EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS WITH THE PEOPLE 
WHO LOOKED AFTER THE PROPERTY ALBERT KHAN WAS ALWAYS OPTIMISTIC 
AND HIS BELIEF IN MANKIND NEVER LEFT HIM 
IN JULY NINETEEN FORTY THAT OPTIMISM WAS SEVERELY TESTED 
WHEN THE GERMAN ARMY ARRIVED IN PARIS 
ALBERT KAHN HAD COME TO THIS CITY AFTER PRUSSIA INVADED FRANCE IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY 
NOW SEVENTY YEARS LATER THE GERMANS WERE IN HIS HOMELAND ONCE AGAIN 
KAHN ESCAPED THE FATE THAT BEFELL MORE THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND FRENCH JEWS 
IN THE NAZI DEPORTATIONS THAT FOLLOWED THE INVASION 
ON FOURTEENTH NOVEMBER NINETEEN FORTY ALBERT KAHN DIED IN HIS BED AGED EIGHTY 
WHEN GERMAN SOLDIERS VISITED KAHN'S HOME THEY TOOK AWAY SOME DOCUMENTS 
LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT WEALTHY JEWS 
BUT HIS PRECIOUS COLLECTION OF FILMS AND AUTOCHROMES WAS LEFT UNTOUCHED 
IT'S RATHER FORTUNATE THAT THESE IMAGES DIDN'T AWAKEN ANY INTEREST 
ON THE PART OF THE OCCUPYING FORCES BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT 
THEIR INTENT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF NAZI IDEALS 
IMAGINE TREATING ALL THESE CULTURES WITH EQUAL RESPECT 
THESE IMAGES WERE PRESERVED AND TODAY THEY SPEAK TO US 
EVEN MORE FORCEFULLY AND DIRECTLY UNLIKE NAZI PROPAGANDA 
FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THE WAR KAHN'S COLLECTION LAY DORMANT 
FEW KNEW WHAT TREASURES WERE HIDDEN IN THE CANS OF FILM 
THE GLASS AUTOCHROMES REMAINED IN THEIR BOXES CONSIDERED TOO FRAGILE AND DIFFICULT TO VIEW 
BUT IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE NEWLY FORMED LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
ESTABLISHED A MUSEUM DEDICATED TO KAHN'S COLLECTION 
AT LAST THE AUTOCHROMES WERE SYSTEMATICALLY CATALOGUED AND PRESERVED 
THE FILM COLLECTION WHICH COULD HAVE DETERIORATED 
AND GONE UP IN FLAMES HAS NOW BEEN CONSERVED AND SAFELY RESTORED 
DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY IS GIVING A NEW LEASE OF LIFE TO THESE IMAGES FROM ANOTHER AGE 
ONCE KAHN'S HOUSE AND GARDENS WERE VISITED BY EUROPE'S POLITICAL AND CULTURAL ELITE 
TODAY HIS HOME IS A PUBLIC SPACE IN WHICH REGULAR EXHIBITIONS 
REVEAL THE TREASURES OF HIS ARCHIVES OF THE PLANET 
ALBERT KAHN IS DEAD HIS IDEALS CONTINUE IN OTHER FORMS AND ORGANISATIONS 
BUT THE AIM OF THE MUSEUM IS TO MAKE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND 
HOW THIS MAN REALISED HIS IDEALS WHICH HAVE A UNIVERSAL AND TIMELESS VALUE 
AND THANKS TO THESE IMAGES WHICH SPEAK TO US SO CLEARLY WE ARE STRAIGHTAWAY CONNECTED TO OUR PAST 
THE REAL VALUE OF THE ARCHIVES OF THE PLANET IS THE CAPACITY TO CONNECT OUR SHARED PAST 
WITH PEOPLE TODAY AND OF COURSE TO FUTURE GENERATIONS 
ALBERT KAHN BELIEVED IT WAS POSSIBLE TO USE PHOTOGRAPHY TO IMPROVE THE WORLD 
BY FOSTERING INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF CULTURAL DIFFERENCES 
HIS PROJECT AMASSED AROUND ONE HUNDRED HOURS OF CINE FOOTAGE 
A COLLECTION THAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT ARCHIVES OF EARLY NON FICTION FILMS 
BUT THERE'S ALSO HIS EXTRAORDINARY PORTFOLIO OF SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND AUTOCHROMES 
A TREASURY THAT INCLUDES THE FIRST EVER COLOUR PICTURES OF MANY COUNTRIES 
COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHS OF SEMINAL MOMENTS IN TWENTIETH CENTURY HISTORY 
AND VERY RARE COLOUR IMAGES OF SOME OF THE MOST EMINENT PEOPLE OF THE AGE 
KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE TO WITNESS EVENTS THAT SHAPED OUR MODERN WORLD 
YET IT'S THEIR INTIMATE PORTRAYAL OF EVERYDAY LIFE 
THAT PROVIDES THE MOST POTENT AND MEMORABLE IMAGES 
IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY ARCHIVE 
PEOPLE AT WORK 
AND AT PLAY 
IN SICKNESS 
AND IN HEALTH 
MOMENTS OF TRIUMPH 
AND DESPAIR 
TIMES OF QUIET REFLECTION 
AND EXUBERANT DISPLAY 
BY USING THE INFANT MEDIUM OF COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHY KAHN ASSEMBLED A COLLECTION 
THAT OFFERS A UNIQUE INSIGHT INTO WHAT WE USUALLY CONSIDER TO BE A MONOCHROME AGE 
IN THE PROCESS ALBERT KAHN CREATED WHAT'S ALMOST CERTAINLY 
THE MOST IMPORTANT COLLECTION OF EARLY COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE WORLD 
ONLY YOU OU OU 
CAN MAKE THIS WORLD SEEM RIGHT 
WE GOT COMPANY 
ONLY YOU 
SOME THINGS JUST GET BETTER WITH AGE 
THE INDIANA JONES TRILOGY CONTINUES 
I'VE CLIMBED MOUNTAINS 
CROSSED JUNGLES AND TREKKED ACROSS THE PLANET'S TOUGHEST TERRAINS 
PUSHING MY BOUNDARIES HAS CHANGED MY LIFE 
AND LAST YEAR ON EXTREME DREAMS I HELPED MORE PEOPLE CHANGE THEIRS 
OH MY GOD I'M GONNA CRY 
NOW I'M BACK TO LEAD MORE ASPIRING ADVENTURERS THROUGH SOME OF THE WORLD'S TOUGHEST ENVIRONMENTS 
REAL DETERMINATION AND GRIT NOW 
JUST TOTALLY EXHAUSTED 
I'M BEN FOGLE AND THIS IS EXTREME DREAMS 
IT'S THE FINAL AND TOUGHEST DAY OF OUR EXTREME DREAM IN NEPAL 
WE'RE WITHIN AN ACE OF OUR GOAL THE REMOTE BEAUTIFUL LAKES OF PANCH POKHARI 
HIGH IN THE DEADLY HIMALAYAN PEAKS OF NEPAL 
BUT BETWEEN US AND THE LAKES LIE THE HARDEST CHALLENGES OF THE ENTIRE ADVENTURE 
I SELECTED FIVE WOULD BE EXPLORERS TO JOIN ME ON THIS LIFE CHANGING JOURNEY 
BUT NONE OF THEM COULD HAVE DREAMED WHAT WAS IN STORE 
VERY VERY HARD 
I COULD JUST GO TO SLEEP RIGHT NOW 
OUR JOURNEY HAS TAKEN US FROM BLIZZARD LASHED PEAKS 
TO SCORCHING TROPICAL VALLEYS 
WHERE A SUSPECTED STOMACH BUG STRUCK DOWN TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD NICOLE 
LEAVING HER SO ILL 
WE HAD TO RISK A DANGEROUS HELICOPTER RESCUE FROM THE SIDE OF A PRECIPITOUS MOUNTAIN 
GOOD LUCK 
AND FOR THE REST OF MY TEAM THINGS HAVE BEEN LITTLE BETTER 
THEY'VE FACED THE MOST PUNISHING TEN DAYS OF THEIR LIVES 
JONNA CAME ON THE TREK TO SHOW SHE CAN BEAT LUPUS 
A DISEASE THAT ATTACKS EVERY ORGAN OF HER BODY 
AND IT'S PLAYED HAVOC WITH HER ON THE TREK 
I AM FEELING 
BOTH PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY DRAINED 
MY BODY'S SCREAMING OUT 
WHAT'S GOING ON 
BRAVELY WALKING ON DESPITE HER AGONY 
HER CONSTANT NEED FOR MEDICAL STOPS PUT US SO FAR BEHIND SCHEDULE 
IT'S THROWN THE WHOLE TRIP INTO JEOPARDY 
FORTY YEAR OLD MUM PAULA CAME ON THE TRIP TO PROVE HER LOVE FOR HER ESTRANGED DAUGHTER PIA 
SHE'S FACED AND OVERCOME HER FEAR OF WATER 
AS WE RAFTED EIGHT TERRIFYING MILES DOWN ONE OF NEPAL'S MOST FEROCIOUS RIVERS 
PAULA HAS BEEN RUTHLESSLY FOCUSED ON HER GOAL OF GETTING TO THE LAKES 
AND JONNA'S SLOW PACE THREW HER INTO A RAGE 
WELL I CAN'T HELP IT NO YOU CAN'T HELP IT CAN YOU 
LAYING ON THE GRASS PAULA PAULA PAULA PAULA I CAN'T HELP WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME 
BUT AS THE CLIMB GOT HIGHER AND HARDER PAULA DEVELOPED A STOMACH BUG AND BEGAN TO WEAKEN HERSELF 
DID YOU SAY THAT THIS IS WORSE THAN CHILDBIRTH 
HONESTLY IT'S WORSE THAN CHILDBIRTH 
NOW IT'S PAULA WHO'S SLOWING DOWN THE GROUP 
JERMAINE WHO PUT HIS LIFE ON HOLD TO LOOK AFTER HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN 
HAS SUFFERED ALTITUDE SICKNESS THAT LEFT HIM SLEEP DEPRIVED NAUSEOUS AND HALLUCINATING 
JERMAINE THINKS HE'S JUST PASSED A PIZZA RESTAURANT 
LAST NIGHT THOUGH HIS SPIRITS RALLIED 
AND HE THREW HIMSELF INTO THE CAMPSITE ENTERTAINMENT WITH THE LOCAL SHERPAS 
THIS IS COOL THIS IS COOL YOU'VE GOTTA PARTY HAVEN'T YOU 
ABSOLUTELY 
BUT TODAY WE GO HIGHER THAN EVER AND I FEAR HIS HEALTH COULD TAKE ANOTHER BATTERING 
HAIRDRESSER PAUL IS ON THE TRIP TO PROVE THAT BEING OLDER DOESN'T MEAN BEING PAST IT 
IF THE GIRLS CAN DO I I CAN DO IT
