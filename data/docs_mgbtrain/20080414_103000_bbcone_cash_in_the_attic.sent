IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PERFECT PLACE TO EXPAND YOUR LEARNING

THE TREAT IS NOT MINE IT'S OWNED BY A FRIEND OF MINE 
I'M GOING TO COME AND LIVE UP HERE WITH HIM AND HIS FINE LADY 
HE OWNS THE PROPERTY ALL THE ANTIQUES ARE OWNED BY HIM BUT HE'S ASKED ME TO SORT THEM OUT 
AH COS THEY WERE LEFT HERE WHEN THE PREVIOUS PEOPLE MOVED OUT 
SO WE'VE GONE THROUGH IT PICKED OUT THE BITS THAT WE WANT THE REST OF IT WE'VE NO IDEA 
THAT'S NICE YOU GET TO LIVE IN THE COTSWOLDS IN RETURN FOR BEING A CLEARER UPPER HAPPY DAYS 
LUCY ARE YOU ONE TOO I JUST GET LUNCH ON THIS I THINK 
YES 
WHAT WILL WE BE RAISING THE MONEY FOR 
I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED IS A SIT DOWN LAWNMOWER 
FOR THE LAND AT THE BACK YEAH 
GREAT LIKE A SAFARI WE'RE GOING TO NEED ONE 
SO I KNOW MY FRIEND HAS GOT HIS EYE ON ONE 
AND I THINK IF WE RAISE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THAT WILL GO TOWARDS IT NICELY SERIOUS LAWNMOWER 
IT'S GOING TO BE A PRETTY BIG ONE O. K. WHERE ARE WE GOING TO LOOK 
OUTSIDE I THINK YOU GET YOUR SCARF LET'S GO OUTSIDE IT'S PRETTY COLD 
AND YOU HAVE A LOOK AT IT LUCKILY I HAVE A HIGH TECH ANTIQUE FINDING DEVICE OUTSIDE 
BUT HE'S GETTING CHILLY O. K. LET'S GO THAT WAY 
THIS HUGE FARMSTEAD CONSISTS OF A BARN A HOUSE TWO COTTAGES AND STABLES 
IT'S JUST AS WELL BECAUSE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED IS A HUGE TARGET TO AIM FOR 
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE OUR EXPERT JONTY HERNDON HAS HIT THE DECKS RUNNING 
SIFTING THROUGH ALL THE DEBRIS TO FIND SOME DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH 
COME ON GUYS LOTS OF WORK TO DO 
OH SO MANY BUILDINGS TO LOOK AT WHERE'S THE BARN 
THE BARN IS THAT WAY 
I SMELL THE EXPERT THAT WAY 
SO THIS IS THE BARN AH THAT'S JONTY 
JONTY THIS IS MARK 
HELLO MATE HI HOW ARE YOU LUCY HI 
SO THIS WAS ALL THE STUFF YOU DIDN'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT 
WE'VE PICKED OUT THE BITS WHICH WE WANT TO KEEP 
THE REST WE'LL CHUCK ON THE SKIP SO THIS IS THE ANTIQUES GRAVEYARD YES WHAT HAVE YOU DUG UP 
A HINGE TOPPED CABINET HERE WHICH IS KNOWN AS A COFFER 
NOW COFFERS WERE AROUND FROM THE FIFTEEN HUNDREDS ONWARDS 
AND BEFORE WARDROBES YOU PUT ALL YOUR CLOTHES AND BELONGINGS IN A CHEST LIKE THIS 
IT REALLY HAS A FANTASTIC RUSTIC CHARM 
SO RUSTIC IT'S FILTHY DIRTY IT'S QUITE OLD 
BUT LOOK HOW SIMPLY IT IS MADE 
THE TIMBER IS OAK O. K. 
AND IT IS A VERY SIMPLE PLANKED FORM SO IF YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THE FRONT 
WE'VE TWO VERY SIMPLE PLANKS YES 
EVERYTHING YOU SEE ON THE TOP WE'VE GOT TWO PLANKS ON THE TOP 
IS ALL HANDMADE 
THE IRONMONGERY IS ALL HANDMADE 
AND LOOK ON THE INSIDE 
THESE ARE ALL HAND FORGED IRON HINGES 
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME THAT THIS IS WORTH A LOT OF MONEY IT'S JUST BOARDS NAILED TOGETHER 
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW OLD THIS IS IT MAY BE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OLD YEAH 
LET'S DOUBLE IT I RECKON IT IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
THREE HUNDRED YEARS YES WOW 
SO WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT THE PRICE 
I THINK THIS IS WORTH BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
NAH THAT'S A GOOD START SO LET'S KEEP GOING AND IF WE KEEP GOING WE'LL MAKE OUR TARGET IN NO TIME 
SPLIT UP AND START TO FIND THIS WAY WHAT ABOUT THIS 
THE VALUATION OF THE COFFER IS AMAZING 
IT WAS A PIECE OF OLD FURNITURE IN THE BARN AND IT'S QUITE VALUABLE 
SO I AM QUITE EXCITED ABOUT THAT 
IF THERE ARE MORE VALUABLE PIECES LIKE THAT HIDDEN IN THE BARN WE STAND A GOOD CHANCE IN THE SALEROOM 
AND WHILE LUCY IS STILL TRYING TO DISH UP MORE THINGS TO SELL 
IT LOOKS LIKE ONCE AGAIN JONTY HAS FOUND AN INTERESTING SPIN OFF 
I'VE GOT SOMETHING STUCK IN MY TEETH STOP ADMIRING YOURSELF 
ADMIRE THIS LUCY COME WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS 
CAST AN EXPERT EYE IT LOOKS VICTORIAN TO ME SHE'S VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE 
YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH OUT YOU'RE CLOSE BECAUSE THIS IS VERY VICTORIAN 
WE'VE A CUPBOARD DOOR HERE 
NOT ONLY HAVE WE A CUPBOARD THERE WE'VE TWO IN THE MIDDLE 
AND ABOVE THAT A FRIEZE DRAWER AS WELL 
AND LOOK AT THIS THAT'S ALL ENGLISH OAK SO IT'S WELL MADE 
EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE IS MAHOGANY 
THIS IS KNOWN AS A CREDENZA 
ONCE UPON A TIME IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A HALF MIRRORED DOOR ON TOP 
IT WOULD HAVE A MASSIVE MIRRORED SUPERSTRUCTURE DO YOU LIKE IT 
NOT MY CUP OF TEA 
I AM MORE MID CENTURY MODERN 
IT IS TOO BIG IT'S TOO CHUNKY BUT IT IS SO WELL MADE 
THERE'S SO MUCH CRAFTSMANSHIP SO MANY HOURS THAT HAVE GONE IN TO MAKING THIS PIECE OF FURNITURE 
HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH I WON'T SAY I AM GOING TO TURN THE TABLES ON YOU I HATE THAT 
HOW MUCH IT DEPENDS HOW MUCH SOMEONE WANTS IT 
I DON'T KNOW AS I WOULD BUT A COUPLE OF HUNDRED QUID ALISTAIR 
I HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU IT'S NOT VERY FASHIONABLE 
I'VE SEEN THEM BOMB BADLY SO I'D SAY EVEN LESS MAYBE FIFTY 
FIFTY QUID FOR THIS IS IT O. K. IF WE TAKE YOU ALONG TO THE SALE 
AND ME NOT TELL YOU ITS VALUE I GUESS SO IT'S A MYSTERY I LOVE A MYSTERY 
LET'S FIND SOMETHING ELSE 
I AM HAPPY FOR THE CREDENZA TO GO TO AUCTION BECAUSE IT IS IN THE WAY 
IF WE CAN MAKE TWO HUNDRED FOR IT THAT'S GREAT 
LET'S NOT GET TOO CARRIED AWAY LUCY 
WITH JONTY'S SILENCE ON THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE CREDENZA 
AND MY DOUBTS ABOUT ITS WORTH IT'S TIME FOR THE TEAM TO SPLIT UP 
AND COVER MORE GROUND 
OH 
I WAS GETTING EXCITED 
IT LOOKS LIKE A GRANDFATHER CLOCK BUT IT'S BEEN DECAPITATED 
THE GEORGE THE THIRD LONG CASE CLOCK 
HAS LOST ITS HEAD BUT WITH THIS ESTIMATE 
IT STILL COULD ADD A LARGE AMOUNT OF CASH TO OUR POT 
WITH MY VERY FIRST GEM UNEARTHED WE ARE SLOWLY MOWING OUR WAY THROUGH TO AUCTION SUCCESS 
AND BEING A BIT OF A MUSIC DUDE MYSELF 
I CAN'T RESIST FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT OUR RESIDENT D. J.'S PRIVATE COLLECTION 
HEY MR. D. J. OH YOU FOUND MY TUNES THEN YEAH CAN I PUT ONE ON YOU BE CAREFUL WITH THAT THIS ONE 
DON'T SCRATCH IT BRONSKI IS THAT YOUR D. J. NAME 
NO THAT'S THE NAME OF THE RECORD 
SPARKY MAX IS ME AND A MATE OF MINE SO THAT'S A COLLABORATION 
IT'S NOT AN ANTIQUE SO HANDS OFF OW 
CAN WE SELL THEM I TELL YOU WHAT THEY WOULD BE WORTH AS MUCH AS THE HOUSE I RECKON 
REALLY YEAH HONES T. LY 
IN YOUR HEART IF YOU SAW THE MAGIC THOSE LITTLE NUGGETS THERE COULD PERFORM 
PRICELESS PRICELESS IS THE WORD HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN D. J. ING 
MY FIRST PAYING D. J. GIG WAS BOURNE BRITISH LEGION IN FARNHAM 
AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN WOW THAT'S A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE DEBUT 
YEAH IT WAS O. K. AND YOU NEVER LOOKED BACK 
I'VE NEVER LOOKED BACK 
YOU'VE ALWAYS MADE YOUR LIVING BY SPINNING DISCS 
WELL WHAT CONSTITUTES A LIVING 
IT'S A PROFESSION AND I AM A PROFESSIONAL 
DO YOU FEEL YOU CAN WORK OUT HERE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE YOU DON'T NEED TO BE IN THE THICK OF THINGS 
THE COUNTRYSIDE IS FANTASTIC 
IT'S LOVELY TO COME OUT OF LONDON TURN EVERYTHING DOWN AND HEAR YOURSELF THINK 
IT'S FRUITFUL IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
SO THE GARDEN IS AN IMPORTANT PROJECT FOR YOU 
I THINK IT IS 
THE GARDEN PROJECT BRIAN HAD ALREADY STARTED THAT BEFORE I MOVED HERE 
AND SEEING EVERYTHING GOING ON 
I THINK WHAT WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD SURPRISE FOR HIM 
WOULD BE TO GIVE HIM A FEW QUID AND SAY GET YOUR SIT DOWN LAWNMOWER 
IF WE MADE A FEW EXTRA BOB WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THE MONEY ER 
IF WE MAKE A BIT MORE MAYBE A SHRUBBERY I DON'T KNOW 
YEA I CAN SEE IT NOW MAYBE A TOPIARY HEDGE WITH CASH IN THE ATTIC SNIPPED OUT 
ER THAT'S A BAD IDEA I THINK WE'LL GO FOR THE LAWNMOWER 
AND MAYBE A PEAR TREE 
THINK ABOUT IT COME ON WE NEED TO GO AND RAISE SOME MONEY FOR OUR LAWNMOWER MR. D. J. 
SO MARK DOESN'T SHARE MY VISION OF WHAT COULD MAKE 
THE PERFECT GARDEN PARADISE 
WHILE WE'RE ALL GETTING OUR HANDS DIRTY 
MARK DECIDES TO STAY AWAY FROM THE DUSTY JUNK OF THE BARN 
JUST A DIRTY BOOK 
IT'S A GOOD MOVE AS HE SPOTS SOMETHING THAT COULD TAKE US ON A JOLLY JOURNEY TO SOME LOVELY LOLLY 
WE WASTE NO TIME IN ADDING THIS VICTORIAN SHIP 
TO TODAY'S PLAYLIST 
WHILE OUR ANTIQUES CONNOISSEUR IS STILL DOUBLE CHECKING THE OLD CLOCK 
LUCY SEEMS TO HAVE SPOTTED SOMETHING THAT MIGHT PUT OUR WORRIES TO REST 
JONTY WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS SOFA 
IT'S FILTHY DIRTY ISN'T IT 
BUT IT'S GOOD YEAH I AM HAVING A THING FOR OLD UPHOLSTERED SOFAS 
I HAD A VICTORIAN ONE I PAID TWENTY TWO FOR AT AN AUCTION ONCE YEAH 
AND I SPENT FOUR HUNDRED ON UPHOLSTERING IT 
THERE'S THE RUB WHEN IT COMES TO UPHOLSTERY THAT IS THE PROBLEM 
BUT LOOK AT THESE SCROLL ARMS THIS SHAPE AND DESIGN IS VERY REGENCY 
SO WE'RE TALKING VERY EARLY PART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SO THIS IS HOW OLD THIS SOFA IS AND LOOKS IT 
IT'S ALMOST TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
BUT IT NEEDS A CLEAN 
THIS NEEDS TO GO TO A RESTORER'S 
AND THEN THE UPHOLSTERY CAN BE CHANGED O. K. HAVE A LOOK AT THE DESIGN 
SEE THESE APPLIED MOULDINGS THESE BRASS MOULDINGS 
HERE AND ALSO HERE 
NOW THOSE ARE ALSO VERY REGENCY IN THEIR FEEL 
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THESE LEGS 
I'LL TIP IT UP SO YOU CAN HAVE A CLOSER LOOK 
LOOK AT THE FEET 
THE SPLAYED FEET HAVE BEEN RESTORED 
THEY'VE BEEN CUT DOWN THEY SHOULD GO OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE 
SOMEBODY HAS REDUCED THOSE 
I WOULD SUGGEST THESE FEET ALMOST NEED TO BE REPLACED 
SO WE ARE LOOKING AT A NOT VERY HIGH PRICE FOR THIS BECAUSE IT IS IN SUCH A POOR STATE 
IT NEEDS COMPLETELY RECOVERING YES 
THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF COST THAT NEEDS TO GO INTO THIS 
IN THIS STATE IT IS WORTH TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED O. K. IS THAT GOOD NEWS 
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE IT TO AUCTION DEFINITELY YES O. K. 
I THINK THE SOFA IS QUITE PRETTY AND ELEGANT 
IN THE RIGHT HOUSE IT COULD LOOK FANTASTIC 
I WOULDN'T BE THE ONE TO SPEND ONE THOUSAND ON IT THOUGH 
STILL SECRETLY TRYING TO COME OUT WITH SOME MORE EXCITING IDEAS FOR THE GARDEN I COME ACROSS 
THIS VICTORIAN CHAIR 
AND OAK LIBRARY TABLE 
IT GOES STRAIGHT ONTO OUR AUCTION LIST 
LUCY IS NOW ESCAPING THE COLD AND DAMP OF THE BARN 
TO RETREAT INTO THE WARMTH OF THE HOUSE WHERE THERE'S STILL A LOT TO GET THROUGH 
THE PICTURES AREN'T ANY GOOD WHAT HAVE YOU GOT AN OLD CLOCK 
THAT'S MOTHER OF PEARL ISN'T IT ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS HERE 
THIS IS FASCINATING I HAVE SPENT ALL DAY LOOKING THROUGH THE BARN 
THE WHOLE OF THE COTTAGE EVERYWHERE 
EVERYTHING I HAVE SPOTTED SO FAR HAS ALL BEEN ENGLISH AS ENGLISH AS THEY COME RIGHT 
THIS IS FRENCH OH LA LA MAIS OUI 
THIS IS A VINEYARD CLOCK 
THIS IS THE GENERIC TERM FOR A WALL CLOCK RIGHT 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE LET ME OPEN IT UP 
THIS IS A RATHER QUIRKY WAY OF OPENING THIS UP 
THAT'S A PAINTED DIAL RIGHT 
SO THAT'S PROBABLY A BRASS DIAL THERE 
YOU SEE THE PENDULUM DOWN THERE ALL THE WORKINGS 
WE'VE GOT A STRIKING GONG 
PERFECT GREAT 
AND YOU CAN TELL IT'S FRENCH SIMPLY BY THE EBONIZED RIB DESIGN 
AND THIS IS A TWENTY FOUR HOUR CLOCK THAT'S QUITE UNUSUAL 
SO WE'VE GOT THE TWELVE AND THEN WE'VE GOT THE TWENTY FOUR ROUND THE INSIDE AS WELL 
FORWARD THINKING 
FRENCH CLOCKS ALWAYS STRIKE WITH A GONG AS WELL SO YOU DON'T HAVE A TING OF A BELL 
IT HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS 
SO WE CAN'T GET HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR IT 
BUT I STILL WE ARE LOOKING AT A VERY C. R. E. D. I. B. L. E. EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
EIGHTY FOR THAT YEAH WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE IT TO AUCTION RIGHT NOW I'LL START THE VAN LET'S DO IT 
I THINK THIS ITEM IS GOING TO SELL AT AUCTION 
IT'S FRENCH IT'S A BIT KOOKY YEAH I THINK PEOPLE WILL LIKE IT 
WITH EVERYONE BACK AT H. Q. WE'RE HOPING NOTHING WILL SLIP PAST 
OUR INQUISITIVE EYES 
AND IT'S MORE GOOD NEWS WHEN JONTY DISCOVERS THIS GILT FRAME 
THAT COULD OUTLINE A PICTURESQUE PROFIT OF 
AH HERE YOU ARE GUYS 
HELLO MATE YOU DID SOME MORE RUMMAGING YES 
ARE THESE THE PLANS THESE ARE THE BITS FOR ACROSS THE LITTLE YARD 
THIS IS EVENTUALLY GOING TO BE MY LITTLE HOME 
IS THIS SERIOUS THIS MOVE TO THE COUNTRY IS IT A LONG CHERISHED DREAM NO 
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY AS I SAID BEFORE A FRIEND HAS BOUGHT EVERYTHING YOU HAVE SEEN TODAY 
SO LAST JANUARY I MOVED UP HERE 
AND MY FIRST JOB WAS TO GET ALL THE STUFF OUT OF THE BIG HOUSE 
AND PUT IT IN THE BARN AS YOU'VE SEEN PICKED OUT WHAT WE NEED 
IT'S QUITE A CHANGE YOU'RE A JOBBING D. J. IN LONDON 
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO GET OUT TO THE COUNTRYSIDE BRILLIANT 
YOU CAN STAND OUTSIDE AND YOU CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING 
AND YOU NEED THAT SO IT'S BEEN A LOVELY OPPORTUNITY TO DECOMPRESS 
TAKE A STEP BACK PUT IT DOWN AND GET ON WITH SOME OTHER STUFF BE A BIT CREATIVE 
WHAT ABOUT YOU LUCY I THINK FOR ME IT IS A WEEKEND RETREAT 
I AM NOT READY TO GIVE UP THE FAST PACE AND DYNAMISM OF LONDON YET 
WHAT'S YOUR CREATIVE LINE OF WORK I'VE GOT A FASHION AND SPORTS P. R. AGENCY IN THE CENTRE OF TOWN 
IN COVENT GARDEN THAT'S PRETTY CUTTING EDGE 
IT'S QUITE HECTIC AND GOOD FUN BUT 
THIS IS JUST LIKE A DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER TOTALLY 
AND HOW DID THE VILLAGE REACT WHEN YOU WILD DISCO MUSIC PEOPLE CAME 
WELL WE DON'T TURN IT UP TOO MUCH SO THEY DON'T GET TO HEAR IT 
BUT WE PLAY CRICKET FOR THE VILLAGE NOW SO YOU'RE INTEGRATING 
HAVE YOU JOINED THE PARISH COUNCIL NO BUT I DO RUN THE PUB QUIZ ON A WEDNESDAY 
WHAT ABOUT THE GARDEN IT WAS STARTED BEFORE I MOVED HERE 
THERE WERE ALREADY GARDENERS IN BRIAN HAS A GREAT VISION OF WHAT HE WANTS 
THEY HAD ALREADY STARTED IT HUGE BIT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE OUT THERE 
EVERYONE KNOWS NEW GRASS TAKES TIME TO GROW YEAH 
AND WHEN IT GROWS WE WANT THE LAWNMOWER TO CUT IT WITH 
SO WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE HERE I LIKE YOUR PRIORITIES 
GOOD THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
WE SHOULD FIND OUT WHAT JONTY'S DOING POOR THING HAS PROBABLY RUMMAGED HIS FINGERS TO THE BONE 
BACK TO WORK 
ALL ROOMS ARE NOW BEING SUBJECTED TO A RIGOROUS SCRUTINY 
WHILE SOMEONE SEEMS MORE INTERESTED IN CHECKING HIMSELF OUT 
LUCY LOOKS AT THINGS FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE 
AND GETS HER HANDS ON A REGENCY PIER MIRROR 
MARK SEEMS TO HAVE SPOTTED SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT ETCH OUT SOME MORE PROFIT 
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND I DUNNO 
THE PICTURE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE COS OF THE BUILDINGS ON THIS SIDE BIT WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER 
THE FRAME IS QUITE INTERESTING BUT I RECKON WE SHOULD GET 
JONTY 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT DROPPING DOWN WITH THE TIDE 
AMAZING FRAME THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT 
THIS IS ALL ORIGINAL FRAME TO THE ETCHING 
SEE ALL THESE LINES ETCHED THE REASON THEY ARE THERE 
IS THE PROCESS OF CREATING THE ETCHING 
DO YOU KNOW HOW AN ETCHING IS CONSTRUCTED 
IF IT IS LIKE AN ETCH A SKETCH THEN WOULD TAKE FOR AGES NO 
THIS IS ALL DONE PROBABLY ON A COPPER PLATE 
THE ENGRAVER LITERALLY SCORES MARKS INTO THE PLATE 
WHAT THEN HAPPENS AFTER THAT THE INK IS LAID 
INTO THOSE SCRATCHES ON THE COPPER PLATE AND ARE THEN WIPED OFF 
THEN PLACED INTO A PRESS WITH THE PAPER GOING OVER THAT 
SO THERE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE IMPRESSED MARK 
FROM THE INK AND THE PLATE 
DOES THE FACT THAT IT IS AN ETCHING MEAN THAT THERE ARE MANY COPIES SO IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE YES 
IT'S A WAY OF REPRODUCING FACSIMILES BEFORE FACSIMILES WERE INVENTED 
AM I GOING TO GET A LAWNMOWER FROM HAVING THIS CUT TO THE CHASE YES 
NOT EXACTLY 
BUT IT IS A VERY NICE GOOD QUALITY ETCHING THERE ARE MANY ETCHINGS 
THAT YOU SEE THAT ARE REALLY NOT OF THIS KIND OF QUALITY 
AS A CONSEQUENCE WE'RE LOOKING AT A VALUE OF SIXTY TO EIGHTY 
MAYBE A BIT MORE SIXTY TO EIGHTY YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE YOU SCOFFING A WEE BIT ER NO 
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT IT 
I THINK IF SOMEONE WANTS TO LOOK AT IT FOR EIGHTY QUID 
THEY CAN THEIR PLEASURE ALL THEIR PLEASURE 
EXCELLENT LET'S TAKE IT DOWN WITH THE OTHER THINGS 
I AM GLAD HE PICKED IT OUT AND FOUND IT INTERESTING 
AND I AM ALSO GLAD IT IS GOING TO SELL FOR SIXTY QUID 
COS I WOULDN'T BUY IT 
WE'RE DETERMINED TO HELP D. J. MARK GET HIS DREAM GARDEN SO BEFORE WE CALL IT A DAY 
WE'RE HAVING ONE FINAL LOOK AROUND 
IT'S BEEN A LONG RUMMAGE 
AND I AM AFRAID JONTY MIGHT NOW BE CLUTCHING AT STRAWS MARK 
LOOK AT THESE THESE OLD THINGS 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE BITS OF TIRED OLD WOOD THAT ARE IN THE WAY 
I THINK THEY'RE GREAT I WANT TO SHOW THE OTHERS 
COS I THINK THESE ARE QUITE INTERESTING GUYS 
CAN YOU COME OVER YOU LIKE THESE GREAT FIND 
I'VE GOT A FUNNY FEELING THERE ARE TWO MORE IN THE BARN REALLY WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE JONTY YOU ARE ALWAYS SHOWING US BITS OF OLD WOOD 
AND PRETENDING THEY ARE WORTH SOMETHING 
WHAT WE HAVE HERE ARE LEAVES TO AN EXTENDING DINING TABLE 
SO THESE ARE EXTRA LEAVES YOU CAN PLACE IN OR TAKE OUT WHERE'S THE REST OF IT NO IDEA 
THE LEGS AND BITS AND BOBS 
EXTENDING DINING TABLES THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE 
SOMETIMES THEY HAVE LOST THE LEAVES THEY ORIGINALLY HAD 
RESTORERS ARE ALWAYS DESPERATE TO FIND OLD SEASONED TIMBER LIKE THIS 
THESE LEAVES CAN BE READAPTED TO A SIMILAR SIZED TABLE 
SO IT'S NOT THAT ALL TABLES ARE THE SAME SIZE AND THESE ARE A STANDARD FIT NO 
TABLES DO HAVE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS HAVING SAID THAT THIS IS ABOUT FOUR F. T. SIX 
WHICH IS ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF A LOT OF DINING TABLES 
SO THEY ARE REALLY WORTH THEIR SALT 
LOOK AT THE BACK SEE THESE HOUSING MARKS 
THESE ARE WHERE THE FORKS OF THE TABLE WOULD HAVE BEEN PLACED 
THE FORKS ARE PIECES OF BRASS THAT SIT INTO EACH LEAF 
AND WE CAN SEE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN USED AT SOME POINT AND RE HOUSED 
SO THEY'VE BEEN RECYCLED BEFORE HAS THIS BEEN PAINTED BLACK 
NO THIS IS THE NATURAL COLOUR OF THE UNPOLISHED MAHOGANY 
AND THIS IS FRENCH POLISHED MAHOGANY ON THE FRONT 
SO THAT'S MAHOGANY ALL SOLID MAHOGANY NOT FIREWOOD 
YOU SAY YOU HAVE ANOTHER TWO PIECES IN THE BARN I THINK SO YEAH 
THESE REALLY DO HAVE VALUE AND I CAN SEE THE FOUR OF THEM BEING PUT INTO A JOB LOT 
AND BEING SOLD FOR AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
I WAS GOING TO CHOP THEM UP AS FIREWOOD 
THAT'S VERY GOOD BECAUSE BY MY RECKONING 
THAT BRINGS OUR TOTAL UP NOT INCLUDING THE CREDENZA 
WE HAVE MADE 
ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY HAVE YOU GOT THE MONEY WITH YOU NO 
WE HAVEN'T SOLD ANYTHING BUT WE'VE GOT ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY WORTH OF ANTIQUES TO TAKE TO AUCTION 
PLUS THE CREDENZA 
THAT SHOULD COVER YOUR LAWNMOWER YOUR LUNCH AND ALL THE EXTRAS FOR YOUR GARDEN 
IT'S LOOKING HOPEFUL BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AT AUCTION SO FINGERS CROSSED 
TODAY HAS BEEN TOUGH BUT WE'VE MANAGED TO COMPILE A GREAT COLLECTION OF ANTIQUES 
TO TAKE TO AUCTION 
THE MODEL OF A VESSEL AT SEA 
UPHOLSTERED REGENCY SOFA 
NINETEENTH CENTURY FRENCH CLOCK 
VICTORIAN CREDENZA WHOSE VALUE WILL BE REVEALED AT AUCTION 
IT'S BEEN A GOOD FEW WEEKS SINCE WE HAD LUCY AND MARK OUT IN THE BARN 
AND WE BROUGHT ALL THEIR GOODIES HERE TO THE HAMPSHIRE AUCTIONS IN ANDOVER 
REMEMBER WE'VE GOT TO GET ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FOR THAT SIT ON LAWNMOWER 
AND TO MAKE A HEAD START WITH THE GARDEN 
LET'S HOPE THE BIDDERS REMEMBER TO DIG DEEP 
HAMPSHIRE AUCTION ROOMS IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS AND THE BUYERS AND DEALERS ARE GIVING EVERY ANTIQUE 
A GOOD LOOK OVER IN THEIR SEARCH FOR A BARGAIN 
FOR OTHERS IT'S JUST A GREAT DAY OUT

AUCTIONEER DOMINIC FOSTER THINKS SOME OF BRIAN'S QUIRKY ANTIQUES 
WILL FIND THE RIGHT BUYER TODAY 
THE FOUR TABLE LEAVES SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM AT ALL TO SELL
