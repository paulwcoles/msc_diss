OWN HANDS IT SAYS IT HAS ITS OWN 
FIGURES WHICH SHOW THAT MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI WILL BE THE NEXT 
PRESIDENT OF ZIMBABWE HERE'S THE 
FIGURES 
THE RESPONSE FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
WAS SWIFT AND IT SAID IT WOULD 
CRACKDOWN ON ANYBODY WHO THREATENED 
THE AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNMENT 
THE B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE 
BUT OUR REPORTER HAS MANAGED TO GET 
IN AND HAS SENT US THIS REPORT 
A VICTORY DANCE FOR ZIMBABWE'S 
OPPOSITION CONFIRMATION THAT THEY 
ARE LIKELY TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE 
COUNTRY'S PARLIAMENT FOR THE FIRST 
TIME MOST HAVE LITTLE ACCESS TO 
THE THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND HAVE TO 
RELY ON STATE CONTROLLED MEDIA FOR 
NEWS THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN SLOWLY 
DRIP FED TO COUNTRY DESPERATE FOR 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
WE WANT TO 
WORK WE WANT TO CHANGE WE WANT 
ZIMBABWE TO BE THE BREAD BASKET OF 
SOUTH AFRICA ONCE AGAIN 
FOUR DAYS 
AFTER THEY VOTED PEOPLE STILL 
DON'T KNOW WHO THE NEXT PRESIDENT 
WILL BE THE OPPOSITION THINKS IT'S 
WAITED LONG ENOUGH AND TODAY MADE 
THEIR OWN DECLARATION PRESIDENT PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS WON THIS 
ELECTION ZANU P. F. HAS LOST THIS 
ELECTION M. D. C. IS IN THE MAJORITY 
THIS IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE WANT 
CHANGE WE FILMED SECRETLY AS WE 
EXCHANGED MONEY ON THE BLACK MARKET 
THE FIGURES ARE BEWILDERING 
ZIMBABWE HAS HYPER INFLATION AND 
PRICES DOUBLE EVERY FEW DAYS FOR 
TEN U. S. DOLLARS I WAS GIVEN FOUR HUNDRED 
MILLION ZIMBABWEAN DOLLARS THE THE PROBLEM IS COMING FROM THE M. D. C. 
THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED 
KINGDOM ARE SO EAGER AND WANT TO 
SEE THE BACK OF ROBERT MUGABE THEY 
WANT HIM TO GO 
ZIMBABWE IS ON THE 
OF HISTORIC CHANGE BUT IT'S STILL 
NOT GUARANTEED AND FEARS OF A 
BACKLASH ARE VERY REAL HAVE OPPOSED ROBERT MUGABE'S 
THREE DECADE RULE IN THIS COUNTRY 
WE REPORT NOW ON THE BATTLE BETWEEN 
ONE OF AFRICA'S LAST DESPOTS AND 
HIS YOUNGER RIVAL TWO FACES OF 
ZIMBABWE ROBERT MUGABE THE 
PRESIDENT FIRST CREDITED WITH 
FREEING THE COUNTRY NOW ACCUSED OF 
RUINING IT AND MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
THE CHALLENGER WHO INSISTS THE 
PRESIDENT HAS CLUNG TO POWER FAR 
TOO LONG ROBERT MUGABE IS ACCUSED 
OF TURNING FROM HERO TO DESPOT THIRTY 
YEARS AGO AND ZIMBABWE'S PEOPLE 
HAILED ROBERT MUGABE AS THEIR 
LIBERATOR ELECTED FAIR AND SQUARE 
AS ZIMBABWE'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER 
HE WAS THE CATHOLIC MARXIST FREEDOM 
FIGHTER WHO HAD LED A GUER RHYL LA 
WAR AGAINST THE WHITE REGIME EVEN 
NOW ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S HARSHEST 
CRITICS SAYS WE SHOULD NOT FORGET 
THE GOOD THAT CAME BEFORE THE BAD 
THIS IS MAN WHO WAS A FREEDOM 
FIGHTER AND WE SHOULDN'T FORGET 
THAT HE WAS QUITE REMARKABLE LEADER 
ARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU LEADER USES THE PAST TENSE HE IS 
HORRIFIED BY MORE RECENT HISTORY AS 
ROBERT MUGABE MOVED TO CRUSH ANY 
AND ALL OPPOSITION HE URGED THUGS 
TO SEIZE WHITE OWNED FARMS AFTER 
YEARS FAILING TO TACKLE THE REAL 
INEQUALITY OF LAND OWNERSHIP HE 
ENRICHED HIMSELF BUILDING THIS 
MANSION ON THE EDGE OF HARARE 
WHERE DID THE MONEY COME FROM HE 
PLUNGED ZIMBABWE INTO ECONOMIC RUIN 
WITH A WORTHLESS CURRENCY AND TOO 
LITTLE TO FEED THE PEOPLE MOST OF 
THEM DESPERATE AND OUT OF WORK 
WITH THAT RECORD A SERIOUS 
CHALLENGE TO PRESIDENT MUGABE WAS 
INEVITABLE MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS 
THAT CHALLENGER WILL HE BE ABLE TO 
RESCUE ZIMBABWE CAN HE LEAD 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS CHARASMATIC 
AND A TRADE UNIONIST TURNED 
POLITICIAN HE IS ALSO CURE RAGEOUS 
HE WAS BEATEN UP FOR LEADING A 
PROTEST MARCH AND ROBERT MUGABE 
SAID HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED HIS 
OWN PARTY HAS SLIP THOUGH MORGAN MORGAN TSVANGIRAI SEEMS TO HAVE STOOD FOR 
GOOD VALUES IN SPITE OF THE 
OPPOSITION THAT HE RECEIVED FROM 
THE GOVERNMENT HE HAS STOOD THE 
THE TEST OF TIME 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
JUST WANTS THE CHANCE TO PROVE 
HIMSELF HE IS CONVINCED THE PEOPLE 
OF ZIMBABWE HAVE VOTED FOR HIM AND 
HAVE REJECTED ROBERT MUGABE BUT 
THIS HEAD TO HEAD IT FAR FROM OVER 
JOHN SIMPSON IS ALSO IN ZIMBABWE 
WE CAN CROSS TO HIM NOW JOHN 
FINALLY A RESULT IN THESE ELECTIONS 
WHAT IS THE REACTION BEEN TO THEM 
TODAY 
WELL RATHER MUTED BECAUSE TODAY THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS AREN'T 
REALLY WHAT MATTER THE FACT IS 
THAT IF ROBERT MUGABE IS GOING TO 
IN POWER THEN PRESUMABLY NO MATTER 
HOW MANY SEATS THE M. D. C. HAS IN 
PARLIAMENT EVEN IF IT HAS A 
MAJORITY HE IS STILL GOING TO BE 
GOVERNING SO EVERYTHING STILL 
DEPENDS ON THOSE ELUSIVE FIGURES 
ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
THESE ARE NOW FOUR DAYS AWAY FROM 
THE TIME THAT THEY WERE CAST AND 
IN FACT IT ISN'T VERY DIFFICULT TO 
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE 
OUTSIDE EVERY POLLING STATION THE 
RESULTS HAVE HAD TO BE POSTED UP IN 
AN EFFORT TO STOP THE THE KIND OF 
FIXING THAT ROBERT MUGABE HAS GONE 
IN FOR IN THE PAST THAT WAS 
SOMETHING THAT WAS IMPOSED ON HIM 
THE M. D. C. FINALLY GOT SICK OF WAITING 
AND ANNOUNCED WHAT THE FIGURES WERE 
OR WHAT THEY BELIEVED THE FIGURE TO 
BE AND NOW WE ARE JUST WAITING 
REALLY TO SEE WHETHER THE OFFICIAL 
AND PRESUMABLY MUGABE INFLUENCE 
THE BODY WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE 
THE ANNOUNCEMENTS WILL COL UP WITH 
THE SAME FIGURE OR IS GOING TO 
INSIST THAT THERE HAS TO BE A RUN 
OFF ELECTION IN THREE WEEKS' TIME 
JOHN ARE YOU SAYING THAT THESE 
RESULTS ARE MADE HAVE MADE NO 
DIFFERENCE TO THE MOOD ON THE 
STREETS AFTER ALL IN THE PAST WE 
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DESPERATION 
AFTER INITIAL JUBILATION AND SO ON 
I JUST THINK NOBODY KNOWS REALLY 
WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON L. WAS 
DRIVING AROUND HARARE TODAY AND I 
NOTICED QUITE A BIG CHANGE FROM 
YESTERDAY YESTERDAY WAS MODERATELY 
RELAXED BY COMPARISON TODAY THERE 
WERE ALL SORTS OF POLICE PRESENCES 
ON THE STREETS THERE WERE THERE 
WAS A ROAD BLOCK ON THE MAIN ROAD 
THAT WE TOOK INTO THE THE CENTRE OF 
TOWN THE POLICE THE RIOT POLICE 
WERE PRESENT WE NOTICED ONE 
PARTICULAR PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT 
SCENE WHERE THE RIOT POLICE WERE 
ARRESTING PEOPLE L. L. THINK IT'S NOT 
AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO THE 
FIGURES SO MUCH AS A SENSE OF 
GROWING NERVOUSNESS ABOUT THE 
DELAYS IN FINDING OUT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING HERE 
JOHN IN ZIMBABWE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AS JOHN WAS SUGGESTING THERE IS 
STILL A LONG TIME TO GO IN THIS 
RACE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS IN 
THE FUTURE OF ZIMBABWE IT'S 
INTERESTING TO NOTE THE STATE RUN 
NEWSPAPER INSIDE ZIMBABWE TALKED 
TODAY OF A RUN OFF BETWEEN MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI AND ROBERT MUGABE A 
SECOND ROUND RUN OFF IF THAT 
HAPPENS IT COULD TAKE ANYTHING UP 
TO THREE WEEKS AND THAT IS THREE 
WEEKS IN WHICH WE COULD SEE 
VIOLENCE IN WHICH WE COULD SEE 
MORE ACCUSATIONS OF VOTE RIGGING L. 
THINK THAT IN A WAY IS WHAT JOHN IS 
TALKING ABOUT THIS THING IS FAR 
FROM OVER THERE IS PLENTY MORE 
THAT THE OPPOSITION NEEDS TO DO 
THE REST OF THE DAY'S NEWS THE 
STEP FATHER OF SHANNON MATTHEWS 
THE SCHOOLGIRL WHO WENT MISSING FOR 
MORE THAN THREE WEEKS HAS BEEN 
ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF POSSESSING

THE JURY AT THE INQUEST INTO THE 
DEATHS OF DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES 
AND DODI FAYED HAS BEEN SENT OUT TO 
CONSIDER ITS VERDICTS IT HAS TO 
DECIDE WHETHER THE DEATHS WERE AS A 
RESULT OF AN ACCIDENT UNLAWFUL 
KILLING OR UNEXPLAINED BUT IT 
CANNOT RETURN A VERDICT OF MURDER 
EVERYTHING NOW RESTS ON 
BUT THE CORONER TOLD THE JURY THAT 
IF THEY STILL HAD SUSPICIONS THAT 
THE CRASH WAS CAUSED DELIBERATELY 
BY SOMEONE THEY SHOULD RETURN AN 
OPEN VERDICT THE CORONER SAID 
THIS 
THEN IN RELATION TO A POSSIBLE 
VERDICT OF UNLAWFUL KILLING CAUSED 
BYMENRY PAUL'S DRIVING THE CORONER 
SAID SAID MENRY 
JUST BEFORE MIDDAY THE JURORS 
GATHERED UP THEIR MANY FILES AND 
DOCUMENTS TO RETIRE THERE IS NO 
HURRY THE CORONER TOLD THEM TAKE 
AS LONG AS YOU NEED COURT SEVENTY THREE WAS 
LEFT EMPTY TO AWAIT THEIR RETURN 
AND THE INTERESTED PARTIES MOHAMED 
AL FAYED AMONG THEM LEFT COURT TO 
PONDER WHAT THE NEXT FEW DAYS MAY 
BRING BRING THE TOP STORY TONIGHT ROBERT 
MUGABE LOSES CONTROL OF ZIMBABWE'S 
PARLIAMENT THE OPPOSITION SAY ITS 
MAN IS THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND 
COMING UP ON LINE AND ON SHOW 
COULD YOUR CHILDREN BE PUTTING TOO 
MUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION ON THE 
NET NET LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON WHERE IS 
BORIS ACCUSATIONS THAT THE MAYORAL 
CANDIDATE IS AVOIDING SOME PUBLIC 
DEBATES PLUS THE WEST LONDON 
SOUL SINGER WHO SAYS SHE HAD TO 
QUIT THE CAPITAL TO BE SUCCESSFUL 
IF YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SECURE A 
NEW MORTGAGE OR RENEGOTIATE TERMS 
YOU WILL KNOW THAT THE MARKET IS 
GETTING TIGHTER FEWER MORTGAGES 
ARE BEING OFFERED AND TWO BANKS 
FIRST DIRECT AND THE CO OP ARE TO 
STOP OFFERING DEALS TO NEW 
CUSTOMERS FOR THE TIME BEING OUR 
BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT HUGH PYM 
HAS JOINED ME IN THE STUDIO WE'RE 
GETTING FAMILIAR WITH THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH WITH BANKS UNWILLING TO 
LEND TO EACH OTHER NOW WE'RE 
SEEING ONE OF THE EFFECTS OF A 
MORTGAGE CRUNCH THE CO OP IS THE 
LATEST BANK TO ANNOUNCE IT IS 
SCALING BACK PULLING DEALS FOR 
TWO YEAR CUSTOMERS THERE ARE NOW 
FEWER THAN FIVE THOUSAND MORTGAGE DEALS ON 
THE MARKET THAT IS DOWN A 
STAGGERING EIGHTEEN PER CENT ON LAST WEEK IT 
MEANS MORTGAGES ARE HARDER TO GET 
AND MORE EXPENSIVE MARK MOORE IS 
HOUSE HUNTING HE HAS TWO CHILDREN 
AND JUST TWO THOUSAND IN SAVINGS THIS 
THREE BEDROOMED HOUSE WOULD BE 
PERFECT BUT HE JUST CAN'T GET A 
MORTGAGE MORTGAGE SO HOW MANY DOORS HAVE YOU FOUND 
HAVE BEEN CLOSED TO YOU WHILE 
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A MORTGAGE SO SO FAR ALL OF THEM I'VE APPROACHED 
TWO MORTGAGE LENDERS AND A MORTGAGE 
ADVISER AND NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE 
TO OFFER ME ANYTHING AT THE MOMENT 
SAYING THEY CAN'T DO ME A ONE H. U. N. 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGE AND THAT'S WHAT I'M 
LOOKING FOR 
WHAT HAS ONE LENDER 
SAID THEY'D BE PREPARED TO LEND 
YOU 
ONE LENDER HAS SAID THEY'RE YOU PREPARED TO LEND ME SIXTY THOUSAND HOW HOW WORRIED ARE YOU BY THE A NOUSMENT 
MADE BY FIRST DIRECT TODAY WELL WELL ONE MORTGAGE LENDER HAS CLOSED NEW 
ACCOUNTS SO IF OTHERS FOLLOW IT 
WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE MARK MARK DREAMS OF BUYING A HOME BUT THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET IS LEAVING PEOPLE 
LIKE HIM BEHIND SO HIS DREAMS ARE 
ON HOLD INDEFINITELY 
OPTIONS ARE LIMITED BECAUSE SOME OF 
THE BEST KNOWN NAMES ARE REIN 
REINING IN THEIR LENDING THE 
NATIONWIDE BUILDING SOCIETY HAS 
DRAWN IN SOME OF ITS TWO YEAR DEALS 
AND HALIFAX HAS NEW RATES FOR NEW 
CUSTOMERS AND THE LEHMAN BROTHERS 
SAYS IT WILL BE REFUSING NEW 
APPLICANTS FOR U. K. MORTGAGES 
HOWEVER FINANCIAL ADVISERS ARE 
STRESSING IF YOU REALLY WANT A 
MORTGAGE YOU WILL FIND SOMETHING 
IT WOULD BE THE WRONG MESSAGE TO 
SAY YOU CAN'T GET A MORTGAGE ANY 
MORE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS YOU 
CAN'T GET MORTGAGES EASILY THAT ARE 
BELOW BANK BASE RATE THAT MARKET 
HAS DISAPPEAR 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT 
MORTGAGES ARE JUST HARDER TO GET AT 
A TIME WHEN HOUSE PRICES ARE 
BEGINNING TO FALL IF THE MORTGAGE 
CRUNCH GETS WORSE THERE COULD BE A 
DOWNWARD SPIRAL IN THE HOUSING 
MARKET MARKET DOWNING STREET HAS CONFIRMED THAT 
THE PRIME MINISTER WILL WELCOME THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH OUTSIDE NUMBER TEN 
THIS SUNDAY THE B. B. C. UNDERSTANDS 
GORDON BROWN'S DECISION TO PUBLICLY 
ACCEPT THE TORCH FOLLOWS FRESH THE 
CHINESE GOVERNMENT THE PROTESTS 
AGAINST CHINA'S POLICIES TOWARDS 
TIBET ARE EXPECTED AS THE TORCH 
CONTINUES ON ITS GLOBAL TOUR 
AS MANY AS ONE IN SIX SCHOOLS IN 
ENGLAND ARE BREAKING THE LAW WHEN 
IT COMES TO DISMISSES THAT IS 
ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT SOME 
ARE APPARENTLY DEMANDING FINANCIAL 
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PARENTS OR 
ASKING THEM WHAT JOBS THEY DO 
HERE IS JAMES WESTHEAD ON THE 
SCHOOLS THAT WERE TODAY NAMED AND 
SHAMED ONE OF LONDON'S MOST 
PRESTIGIOUS CATHOLIC SCHOOLS NOW 
ACCUSED OF ACTING UNLAWFULLY THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS ONE OF ALMOST 
ONE HUNDRED MAINLY FAITH SCHOOLS A SURVEY 
FOUND BROKE RULES ON ADMISSIONS 
BUT THE HEAD TEACHER HERE IS 
FURIOUS HE SAYS THE BREACH WAS A 
MINOR TECH TECHNICALITY TO DO WITH 
WORDING ON THE APPLICATION FORM AND 
THE SCHOOL HAS NOT BROKEN THE LAW 
I FELT ANGRY AND I FELT INSULTED 
AND I FELT THAT MY PERSONAL 
INTEGRITY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY 
THEITY OF OUR ADMISSIONS AUTHORITY 
WAS BEING CALLED INTO ACCOUNT BUT BUT THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT SOME 
SCHOOLS ARE TRYING TO SCREEN 
PARENTS BY ASKING FOR INAPPROPRIATE 
INFORMATION SUCH AS JOBS OR 
MARTIAL STATUS AND EVEN IN SOME 
CASES FOR MONEY 
THAT IS CLEARLY 
ILLEGAL AND THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES OF 
SCHOOLS ASKING PARENTS TO SIGN 
STANDING ORDER FORMS AND SO ON 
THOSE ARE ALL COMPLETELY 
UNACCEPTABLE THEY ARE IN TOTAL 
BREACH OF THE LAW 
ONE FAMP WAS 
THIS JEWISH PRIMARY SCHOOL IN NORTH 
LONDON WHICH ASKED FOR A FIFTY 
DEPOSIT BUT LIKE SEVERAL IN 
BARNET DENY THE CASH WAS LINKED TO 
SCHOOL PLACES 
SEVERAL PRIMARY 
SCHOOLS ASKED PARENTS FOR FIVE 
VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION AND THAT'S 
FOR THE RELIGIOUS ASPECTS OF THE 
SCHOOL OR FOR SECURITY BUT THERE 
IS NO TRUTH IN THE ALLEGATION THAT 
PARENTS WILL TO PAY FOR A PLACE 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES INSIST THAT NO 
CHILD HAS LOST OUT APPLYING TO 
SCHOOLS LIKE THIS ONE BUT THE 
GOVERNMENT INSISTS IT IS NOT MAKING 
A FUSS ABOUT NOTHING AND THIS IS 
ABOUT FAIRNESS AS MANY AS ONE IN 
SIX SCHOOLS MAY BE BREAKING THE 
RULES ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT 
BUT MANY FAITH SCHOOLS ARE ANGRY 
OVER WHAT THEY SAY ARE EXAGGERATED 
CHARGES IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE 
THEIR STATUS 
THE IRISH PRIME MINISTER BERTIE 
AHERN HAS UNEXPECTEDLY ANNOUNCED 
THAT HE IS RESIGNING NEXT MONTH HE 
HAS BEEN FACING CLAIMS OF WRONG COG 
DOING IN HIS FINANCIAL AFFAIRS 
CLAIMS HE HAS CONSISTENTLY DENIED 
WHILE I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT 
I HAVE MADE MISTAKES IN MY LIFE AND 
CAREER ONE OF THE MISTAKES I HAVE 
NEVER DONE IS TO MISUSE THE TRUST 
OF THE PEOPLE L. HAVE NEVER 
RECEIVED A PAYMENT OR MISUSED THE 
OFFICE I HAVE HELD 
LET'S TALK TO 
DENIS MURRAY FROM DUBLIN DENNIS 
WHY IS HE GOING NOW PRECISELY PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THESE NEVER ENDING 
ALLEGATIONS ABOUT HIS PERSONAL 
FINANCES HE CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR 
PAYMENTS HE HAS RECEIVED AND ONE IN 
PARTICULAR WAS PAID INTO A BUILDING 
SOCIETY ACCOUNT WHICH HE SAID HE 
USED ONLY FOR HIS SALARY BUT THIS 
PAYMENT WAS IN STERLING SO IT 
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIS SALARY 
BECAUSE IN THOSE DAYS THEY WOULD 
HAVE BEEN PAID IN THE IRISH POUND 
THE PUNT SO HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO 
PROTECT HIS GOVERNMENT AND THE 
FIANNA FAIL BUT HE WAS QUITE 
EMOTIONAL THIS MORNING L. THINK HE 
WOULD HAVE MUCH RATHER GONE LATER 
THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT YEAR 
SO IF 
HE IS EFFECTIVELY BEING FORCED TO 
RESIGN HOW WILL PEOPLE LOOK BACK 
AT HIS YEARS AT THE TOP WHAT KIND 
OF A LEADER WAS HE 
HE WAS AN 
EXCELLENT POLITICAL LEADER HE HAD 
THE COMMON TOUCH HE BROUGHT 
POLITICAL STABILITY TO THE REPUBLIC 
OF IRELAND WHEN I WORKED FOR THE 
B. B. C. BACK IN THE ZEROS AT ONE STAGE 
THERE WERE GENERAL ELECTIONS THREE 
GENERAL ELECTIONS IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
HE'S HELPED THE CELTIC TIGER 
ECONOMY COMING UNDER A BIT OF 
PRESSURE AT THE MOMENT BUT MORE 
THAN ANYTHING HE WILL BE 
REMEMBERED FOR THE GOOD FRIDAY 
AGREEMENT PROCESS AND THAT WILL BE 
A LASTING LEGACY 
PRESIDENT BUSH HAS URGED NATO 
ALLIES TO SEND MORE TROOPS AND 
OFFER EXTRA RESOURCE TOSS 
AFGHANISTAN THE PRESIDENT IS 
ATTENDING FIVE TWO DAY NATO SUMMIT IN 
THE ROMAIN YAN CAPITAL BUCHAREST 
NATO CURRENTLY HAS FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND TROOPS IN 
AFGHANISTAN FROM FORTY DIFFERENT 
NATIONS MILLIONS OF YOUNG CHILDREN 
COULD BE PLACING THEMSELVES AT RISK 
EVERY TIME THEY LOG ON TO A SOCIAL 
NETWORKING WEBSITE MANY POST 
PERSON DETAILS TONNE THE WEB 
WITHOUT USING SECURITY SETTINGS 
ON SHOW ON LINE FOR ANYONE TO SEE 
ON SITES LIKE BEBO AND MYSPACE 
TEENAGERS ARE PUTTING TOO MUCH OF 
THEIR LIVES ON THE WEB WITHOUT 
THINKING OF THE CONSEQUENCES THAT 
IS THE CONCLUSION OF NEW RESEARCH 
THE OFCOM REPORT PRAISES SOCIAL 
NETWORKING FOR HELPING CHILDREN 
DEVELOP NEW SKILLS BUT ALSO WARNS 
OF THE DANGERS TODAY'S RESEARCH 
SHOWS THAT HALF OF ALL CHILDREN IN 
BRITAIN WHO HAVE INTERNET ACCESS 
HAVE PROFILE ON A SOCIAL 
NETWORKING SITE THE MAJORITY OF 
THEM ON BEBO BUT IT ALSO SHOWS 
THAT MILLIONS OF THEM ARE DOING 
NOTHING TO KEEP THOSE PROFILES 
PRIVATE AND THAT THEIR PARENTS 
OFTEN UNDERSTAND LITTLE OF THIS 
WORLD AT LONDON'S SCIENCE MUSEUM 
WE FOUND PARENTS PUZZLED ABOUT 
NETWORKING AND CHILDREN WHO SEEMED 
CONFIDENT THEY COULD USE IT SAFELY 
I'M SIMON AND I'M THIRTEEN AND I'M ON 
BEBO 
SIMON SAYS ONLY HIS FRIENDS BEBO CAN SEE HIS PROFILE BUT DOES HIS 
MUM UNDERSTAND PRIVACY SETTINGS IT IT IS CONFUSING BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING 
L. KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT IS A 
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT IS A COMPLETE MUDDLE FOR ME I'M I'M KAYLEIGH AND I'M AGED THIRTEEN AND I USE 
SMN 
SHE KNOWS SHE HAS HER PROFILE SMN PRIVATE BUT WHAT DOES HER DAD KNOW 
ABOUT IT 
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING 
ABOUT IT IT'S USED BY CHILDREN 
ARE YOU AWARE OF HER SETTINGS I I HAVE NO IDEA OF THE SETTINGS FOR 
BEBO 
THE HOME OFFICE WILL SOON BEBO UNVEIL A CODE ON SAFER SOCIAL 
NETWORKING A DRAFT VERSION SAYS 
THE NETWORK SHOULD MAKE THE DEFAULT 
PRIVATE FOR CHILDREN AND KEEP THE 
INFORMATION AWAY FROM ADULT CONTENT 
AND PUT NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY 
NUMBERS ON THEIR SITES 
IN ORDER TO USE BEBO YOU MUST BE 
THIRTEEN AND OVER 
BEBO AND OTHER 
NETWORKS SAY THEY ARE WORKING TO 
BEEF UP THEIR SECURITY BUT SOCIAL 
NETWORKING IS NOW UNDER PRESSURE TO 
PROVE IT CAN BE SAFE 
NOW TIME TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
WEATHER WEATHER AND A VERY PRETTY PICTURE BEHIND
