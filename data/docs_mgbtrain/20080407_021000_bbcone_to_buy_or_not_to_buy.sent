AND NO DESTINATION IS TOO DISTANT AND THAT SHOW COULD TAKE YOU TO EVERY CORNER OF THE NATION 
AND MAYBE EVEN MIDDLE EARTH AND THAT SHOW IS TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
TODAY WE'RE IN HALL GREEN IN THE HEART OF ENGLAND 
AND TO ONE YOUNG BOY CALLED JOHN RONALD REUEL THIS COULD VERY WELL HAVE BEEN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE EARTH THAT YOUNG BOY GREW UP TO BE 
THE LITERARY GENIUS JRR TOLKIEN 
IT WAS IN THE SHADOW OF THIS GREAT MILL THAT HE FOUND THE INSPIRATION 
FOR MIDDLE EARTH AND HIS NOVEL THE LORD OF THE RINGS 
BUT TODAY WE'RE FOLLOWING A DIFFERENT FELLOWSHIP A FAMILY ON A QUEST 
FROM THE SAVANNAS OF ZIMBABWE TO THE SHIRES OF HALL GREEN

THEY HAVE MOVED AROUND DIFFERENT AREAS RENTING PROPERTY AFTER PROPERTY ALONG THE WAY 
BOTH MANSOOR AND THE CHILDREN ARE FOOTBALL CRAZY AND THE WHOLE FAMILY ARE ARDENT LIVERPOOL FANS 
WHILE THE BOYS ARE BUSY SHAMEMA LOVES TO INDULGE IN HER PASSION FOR ARTS AND CRAFTS 
CREATING MASTERPIECES SUCH AS SCATTER CUSHIONS QUILTS AND GLASS PAINTED POTS 
AND AWAY FROM HEADERS AND VOLLEYS IN THE GARDEN MANSOOR IS A SELF TAUGHT GUITAR PLAYER 
AND ENJOYS HELPING ELDER SON SABIR FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS 
NOW ALL THIS FAMILY FUN ISN'T THE SAME IN A RENTED PROPERTY

INDEED NOW HALL GREEN WAS THE CHILDHOOD HOME OF JRR TOLKIEN 
FOLLOWING HIS FAMILY'S MOVE FROM SOUTH AFRICA IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES 
ALONG WITH OLD SAREHOLE MILL IT WAS THE GREENERY PARKS AND THE REGION'S STREAMS 
WHICH INSPIRED TOLKIEN TO USE THE AREA AS HIS MODEL 
FOR THE SHIRE OF HOBBITON COMPLETE WITH THE EVIL TWIN TOWERS 
NOWADAYS TOLKIEN'S PERSONAL MIDDLE EARTH HAS BEEN MASSIVELY DEVELOPED 
AND HALL GREEN IS NOW A THRIVING SUBURB OF BRITAIN'S SECOND CITY WITH A POPULATION OF WELL OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
AS WELL AS GREAT ACCESS TO THE M. FORTY TWO MOTORWAY AND BIRMINGHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 
IT IS A SUPERB LOCATION FOR MANSOOR AND SHAMEMA TO SETTLE 
MOST OF THE HOUSES IN THE REGION WERE BUILT AROUND THE TIME OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
AND MANY PEOPLE ARE ATTRACTED TO THESE TRADITIONAL SEMI DETACHED PLACES 
AS THEY ARE FULL OF CHARACTER AND ARE BUILT ALONG TREE LINED AVENUES 
NO WONDER THAT PROPERTY IN THIS POPULAR AREA IS MOVING VERY FAST 
MOTOR RACING COMMENTATOR MURRAY WALKER AND LEGENDARY COMEDIAN TONY HANCOCK JOIN TOLKIEN

TIME FOR US TO USE OUR ALL SEEING EYES TO SEE WHAT MANSOOR AND SHAMEMA 
CAN AFFORD WITH THEIR BUDGET OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE U. K.

WHEN THEY SEE THIS SECOND FLOOR PENTHOUSE IN DORSET 
IT HAS TWO BEDROOMS TWO BATHROOMS AND IT'S A STONE'S THROW FROM THE SEA

WITH ITS RETRO STYLING AND SWISH KITCHEN IS A FANTASY COME TRUE 
AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND

MM I'M ENJOYING THE CEILING GOOD KARMA 
IT'S JUST GOT LIKE BITS AND BOBS EVERYWHERE AND THAT WOULD BE LIKE THE SEPARATE UTILITY AREA 
OR THE WASHING AREA DON'T SEE THE WASHING 
THAT WOULD BE YOUR WASHING UP AREA AFTER DINNER AREA 
BREAKFAST NOOK YEAH 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T NEED A SEPARATE UTILITY AREA 
BECAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE SURPRISE IN THE GARETTE 
THERE'S THE STORAGE YES 
ADEQUATE ROOM FOR YOUR WASHING MACHINE AND THEY'VE GOT BICYCLES 
YEAH YOU SEE IT'S A GOOD SPACE THERE 
UNFORTUNATELY WHERE DO YOU PUT THE CAR 
YOU HAVE A VERY SMALL CAR HALF A CAR 
OOH SPACIOUS BATHROOM VERY SPACIOUS 
I'M COUNTING LOOS FOR IKRAM THE SECOND LOO 
IT'S A SECOND LOO FOR IKRAM YES

MAJOR I MEAN IT'S ENGLAND WE CAN GET ALL THE 
APPLIANCES HERE ADD AN EXTRA SHOWER IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM TO ADD ONE 
BUT IT'S LOVELY IT'S THE RIGHT SIZE I THINK 
IT'S COMFORTABLE IT'S NOT CLAUSTROPHOBIC YEAH 
SEE I HAVE TO SAY LIKE WORKING WITH YOU IAN SHE'S HAPPY WITH THE SIZE AND SHE'S COMFORTABLE 
OH THIS IS LOVELY 
OH IT IS LOVELY THIS IS YOUR COLOUR YEAH 
I THINK WE'D MAKE THIS OUR BEDROOM BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE GARDEN AT THE BACK THERE

SHE LIKES THE VIEW OF THE BACK GARDEN WE'RE O. K. AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE

MAKE SOME LOVELY CUPBOARDS THERE YEAH YEAH 
AND INCORPORATE THE CHIMNEY BREAST 
CONVERT THAT LIKE INTO A DRESSING AREA YES 
I CAN GET MY MASCARA RIGHT THIS TIME 
LOOK AT THE CEILING AGAIN IT'S REALLY NICE

WE'VE NEVER HAD PEOPLE HAVING A CEILING THING GOING ON 
OH ACTUALLY I MIGHT HAVE THIS BEDROOM 
OH YOU SEE THE CUPBOARDS DO YOU YEAH YEAH LOADS OF CUPBOARDS ALREADY MADE UP FOR YOU YEAH 
OH WOW IT'S A BIT SMALL IT'S NOT SO INCEY OH IT'S NOT SO INCEY 
NO THERE'S A BUNK BED IN HERE YEAH 
THE BOX ROOM IT'S PERFECT FOR A HOBBIT 
JENNY'S DONE REALLY WELL WE'LL HAVE TO TALK TO THEM AND SEE IF THEY WANT TO LEAVE THIS BEHIND 
THE EXERCISE MACHINE THIS IS THE MINI GYM YEAH SHALL WE GO FIND THOSE TWO 
WE BETTER GO AND SEE WHAT MANSOOR AND SHAMEMA MAKE OF YOUR PROPERTY 
YOU BETTER COME BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT YOU'RE A HARD HOBBIT TO BREAK 
SO SHAMEMA YOU LOVE THIS AREA THE KITCHEN AREA 
I KNOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU YEAH 
AND YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF SPACE HERE BUT YOU WERE BOTH DISCUSSING 
AS WE WERE OVERHEARING THE SHAPE OF THE ROOM I'VE GOT TONNES OF IDEAS 
WE WERE THINKING OF PROBABLY HAVING AN ARCHWAY THERE AH 
SO IT'S LIKE KITCHEN CUM DINING ROOM 
OPENING THAT UP AND THEN HAVING AN EXTENDED KITCHEN BREAKFAST NOOK I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
ITS VERY ZIMBABWEAN THIS OPEN PLAN DINING ROOM CUM KITCHEN 
AND THEN IF YOU ZOOM OVER THIS SIDE YEAH 
BACK INTO THE UTILITY AREA ANOTHER OPTION IS WE COULD DO IT THIS WAY 
AH SO YOU COULD GO INTO WHERE THE CUPBOARD IS UNDERNEATH THE STAIRS 
BUT INCORPORATE A PANTRY AREA AS WELL OH 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M HERE AND THEN STILL HAVE THE UTILITY ROOM IN THERE 
NOW MANSOOR I THINK WE'RE IN THE BEST PART OF THIS HOUSE AND THAT'S THE GARDEN 
I LIKE IT IT'S BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT 
I'M NOT A BIG FOOTBALL PLAYER BUT THIS IS GOOD FOR FOOTBALL 
THERE'S ENOUGH SPACE FOR THE BOYS TO RUN AROUND 
I WANNA TALK ABOUT THE SPACE IN THE HOUSE IT'S GOT POTENTIAL 
I FEEL THAT IT'S LACKING ONE ROOM FOR YOU A LITTLE PLACE TO HIDE AWAY 
SOMETHING THAT'S BECOMING POPULAR IN THIS COUNTRY IS SOMETHING CALLED PODS 
THEY COME IN PRE FABRICATED STRUCTURES 
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL AND YOU PUT THEM AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR GARDEN 
AH PLANNING LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY MEAN THAT YOU DON'T NEED PLANNING PERMISSION FOR THEM 
THEY COME PRE WIRED ALL VERY VERY GREEN CREDENTIALS THERE VERY WELL INSULATED 
BIG GLASS YOU COULD STILL LOOK AT THE HOUSE BUT THEY STILL GIVE YOU THAT PLACE TO GO AND DO YOUR THING 
SO WHETHER IT'S THE KIDS' PLAY ROOM WHETHER IT'S YOUR HOME OFFICE IT CAN'T BE USED AS A PLACE OF WORK 
DIFFERENT REGULATIONS APPLY BUT FOR A HOME OFFICE THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
SOMETHING TO BEAR IN MIND WITH A BIG GARDEN 
HEY LOOK JUST OVERHEARD A BIT OF THAT TWO PEAS IN A POD YOU ARE 
AND WE'VE COME TO OUR FIRST GUESS THE PRICE HERE 
AND I KNOW YOU'RE VERY NERVOUS ABOUT IT ARE YOU ARE YOU TWO COMPETITIVE

IT'S A SEMI DETACHED PROPERTY SAME AREA THREE BEDROOMS 
HOWEVER INSIDE IT'S COMPLETELY DONE 
YOU ALSO GET OFFICE SPACE YOU GET THAT FANTASTIC GARDEN 
AND AND SHAMEMA TAKE A LOOK AT THE KITCHEN 
ALL I WILL SAY IS YOU KNOW THAT GARAGE THE MINI GARAGE THAT WE'VE DECIDED AND MADE UP

THERE IS A LOT OF SPACE I THINK THIS FAMILY WELL THE TWO BOYS THEY NEED SPACE 
ALSO SHAMEMA SAYS SHE DOESN'T JUST LIKE COOKING IT'S PART OF HER LIFE THE KITCHEN'S CRUCIAL AN EVENT 
THERE'S AN OFFICE HERE 
IT'S HUGE COMPARED TO HOW IT LOOKED OUTSIDE OH I COULD JUST SEE ME SITTING HERE AND DOING MY IT 
OR YOUR PAPERWORK 
NOW THIS IS YOUR DOWNSTAIRS OFFICE BUT PLAYROOM IT COULD ALSO BE A PLAYROOM 
OR A UTILITY ROOM ARTS AND CRAFTS ARTS AND CRAFTS

OH COME AND HAVE A LOOK LOOK AT THE GARDEN OH IT'S LOVELY 
IT'S HUGE HUGE 
WHAT I LIKE YOU KNOW IS YOU GET A FOOTBALL PITCH HERE 
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS LITTLE HIDDEN IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SECRET GARDEN 
NO A GARDEN CENTRE 
NO A REALLY SPECIAL 
MIDDLE EARTH 
IF YOU USE YOUR IMAGINATION 
I JUST SAW A HOBBIT THEN DID YOU 
THE BOYS' ROOM WE'RE GONNA FIGHT 
WE'RE GONNA SEE WHO WANTS WHICH ROOM OVERLOOKING THE GARDEN YES 
BUT YOU COULD EASILY HAVE BOTH END CUPBOARDS HERE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CHIMNEY 
LOVELY 
BAY WINDOW DO YOU LIKE THE BAY WINDOWS NOW 
WELL I THINK IT GIVES A BIT MORE CHARACTER TO THE PROPERTY 
IT GIVES THE ROOM MORE SPACE 
AND DOESN'T MAKE IT FEEL CLAUSTROPHOBIC 
AHH NEW FITTINGS IN THE BATHROOM NICE VERY NICE 
TOWEL RACKS AND I'M SURE THERE'S A SHOWER BEHIND HERE OH THERE IS 
DO YOU LIKE THE SHAPE OF THE BATH

COME ON IAN I'LL RACE YOU TO THE FINISH LINE 
NOW SHAMEMA I'M NOT ONE TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH 
BUT IT DOESN'T NEED A LOT DOING TO IT DOES IT NO IT'S ALL DONE YEAH 
I THINK THE ONLY THING LETTING IT DOWN IS OUT THE FRONT HERE 
IT'S WHAT WE BRITS CALL CURB APPEAL 
SO WHEN YOU DRIVE PAST IT'S A BIT DISAPPOINTING 
YEAH WHAT WOULD BE A NINETEEN THIRTY'S STYLE 
IT'S VERY INTERESTING IN TERMS OF PERIODS OF HOUSES 
WE'VE GOT THE VICTORIAN STYLE 
WE'VE GOT GEORGIAN REGENCY NINETEEN THIRTIES THEY'RE ALL VERY CLEAR DESIGNS AND DIFFERENT STYLES 
AND THIS IS A VERY DISTINCTIVE NINETEEN THIRTIES HOUSE I HEARD YOU GUYS MENTION THE BAY INSIDE 
THAT'S WHAT HOUSES WERE BUILT LIKE IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
IT'S WHEN HOUSES WERE BUILT MORE QUICKLY IF IT'S FAIR TO SAY 
THE VICTORIANS SPENT LOTS OF TIME AND MONEY BUILDING VERY GRAND HOUSES 
AND THIS WAS PRACTICALITIES BUT THEY'RE WELL BUILT DO YOU LIKE THE STYLE 
I THINK WE'D PROBABLY BRING OUT THE PORCH A LITTLE BIT MORE 
AND THEN THE BOYS AND I WOULD PROBABLY DO SOME ATTACK SOME ART 
ART YEAH SOME ATTACK WOW I LIKE THE IDEA OF THAT 
I THINK IT'S A SHAME LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY STOP USING THEIR GARAGES 
AND MAKE THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE INTO ONE BIG DRIVEWAY AND IT GETS RID OF THE COLOUR 
SO IT'S NICE WHEN YOU KEEP A BIT OF PLANTING 
BUT I'VE NEVER THOUGHT OF A BIT OF ART ON THE DRIVEWAY BUT NOT ME WITH THE DIY

ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S NOT SUCH A SMALL PROPERTY DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT THE EXTRA RECEPTION ROOM

THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS YOU START TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART 
I COULD DO MY MAKE UP IN HERE REALLY WELL IT'S VERY LIGHT 
THE WHOLE HOUSE GIVES YOU THAT SENSE OF LIGHT YES LIGHT COLOURS

A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS FOR YOU TWO I THINK WHAT ARE THEY NOT ENOUGH SPACE

YOU'VE GOT ALL THIS ROOM TO PLAY WITH YOU COULD DO SO MANY THING S. W. I. T. H. IT 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT YOU'VE BEEN TELLING US ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
SO WHAT COULD YOU DO WITH IT 
UTILITY AREA FOR ART DIY 
GARAGE SHALL I GO ON BICYCLES BICYCLES 
SO NOW I'M OPENING YOUR EYES TO THE FACT THAT O. K. THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH ROOM IN THE HOUSE 
BUT OUT HERE HOW ABOUT MAKING SOMETHING OUT OF THAT YEAH 
NOW MANNY AS WE'RE THE MEN WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE CARS IN THE DRIVEWAY YES 
WALKING OUT BETWEEN THESE HOUSES YOU'LL SEE THERE'S NOT ROOM FOR TWO CARS JUST ABOUT ROOM FOR ONE 
YES YOU'D HAVE TO FOLD THE MIRRORS BACK THAT'S TRUE 
BACK IN THE THIRTIES CARS WERE A LITTLE BIT NARROWER 
COME UP HERE WE COME TO THIS IT'S TWO GATES SO OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T GET YOUR CAR THROUGH THERE 
AND THAT WORRIES ME A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS A SHARED ACCESS AGREEMENT 
YOU'D BOTH BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THIS ONE DRIVEWAY 
AND ALSO ORIGINALLY YOU'D HAVE HAD THE GATES SLOPING RIGHT BACK 
SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE BOTH DRIVEN YOUR CARS INTO A GARAGE THERE THIS HAS BEEN CHANGED 
PROBABLY BY LOCAL AGREEMENT SO YOU'D DEFINITELY NEED TO GET YOUR SOLICITOR TO LOOK AT THE DEEDS 
SO YOU CAN'T GET A CAR THROUGH HERE BUT YOU CAN GET YOU AND ME THROUGH SHALL WE SHALL WE 
MAYBE YOU NEED HIM INDOORS TO HELP YOU OUT A BIT BECAUSE YOU'RE A GREAT PARTNERSHIP 
I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME BUT EH ALWAYS WHEN I'M OUT OF EARSHOT ISN'T IT 
BUT I FEEL LIKE THEY NEED TO MAKE A DECISION TOGETHER THEY'RE VERY WELL BALANCED IAN YOU'RE RIGHT 
TIME FOR GUESS THE PRICE GUESS THE PRICE WHO'S GONNA GO FIRST 
YOU WANT ME TO GO FIRST I THINK YOU SHOULD MANNY COME ON MANNY GO WILD LIKE THE WILD CARD 
TWO HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED RIGHT O. K. 
SHAMEMA 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
WHAT DID YOU SAY TWO HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
WELL LET ME TELL YOU THE PRICE OF THIS PROPERTY IS TWO HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND WHAT MAKES ME EVEN MORE PLEASED 
IS THE FACT THAT YOU ACTUALLY ARE QUITE NEAR TO THE ASKING PRICE FOR A CHANGE AT LAST 
NOT TWENTY THOUSAND OUT SO IS THAT GOOD NEWS DOES THAT CHANGE YOUR MIND AT ALL 
ANY INCLINATIONS WE'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT 
YEAH YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF DECISIONS TO MAKE HAVEN'T YOU 
A LOT OF DECISIONS YES I THINK IN EACH PROPERTY THERE'S SOMETHING YOU LIKE DEFINITELY 
YES IF YOU COULD PUT ALL THE ELEMENTS TOGETHER IT'D BE PERFECT 
BUT YOU CAN'T AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION THE ONLY WAY TO HELP YOURSELVES 
IS TO TEST DRIVE ONE OF THOSE PROPERTIES YEP 
ALL RIGHT WELL IF YOU WANT TO GO OFF HAVE A LITTLE CONFLAB 
GET INSPIRED 
AND WE'LL MEET YOU AT THE PLACE YOU'RE GONNA TEST DRIVE O. K. ALL RIGHT WE'LL SEE YOU THERE 
WHILE THEY'RE HAVING THAT CONFLAB HERE'S A REMINDER OF THE THREE PROPERTIES 
FIRST OFF THERE WAS MY CHOICE WITH THE GORGEOUS CEILINGS AND GARETTE 
IT HAS THREE GOOD SIZED BEDROOMS TWO RECEPTION ROOMS AND A LOVELY MATURE GARDEN 
BEST OF ALL IT'S WELL UNDER THE BUDGET AT ONE HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
OR HOW ABOUT PROPERTY TWO THE ONE WITH THE COMFORTABLE STAIRS 
THERE'S A WIDE FEATURE WINDOW AND CRITICALLY ROOM FOR MANSOOR'S PLASMA T. V. 
IT HAS LOADS OF EXTRA SPACE BUT IT'S SLIGHTLY OVER BUDGET AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
OR WILL THE CHARMS OF OUR WILD CARD WIN OUR COUPLE OVER WITH THE ART ATTACK OUTHOUSE 
LOVELY BAY WINDOWS AND A STUNNING BATHROOM
