O. K. RIGHT SO THAT'S REDUCING DOWN NICELY 
WE'LL ADD THE ARROWROOT IN A MOMENT 
WE DO HAVE A QUICKIE QUESTION SO EARS OPEN 
TODAY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OUR QUICKIE QUESTION COMES FROM ADELE CAPLAN 
I DETECTED A LITTLE BIT OF AN ACCENT WHEN I FIRST SPOKE WITH YOU 
YES I'M FROM SOUTH AFRICA WELCOME TO ENGLAND ARE YOU ENJOYING YOURSELF 
YES BUT I DO LIVE HERE NOW HAVE YOU PICKED UP SOME COOKING TIPS TODAY 
IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL LOVELY WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK THE CHEFS 
WHEN I BAKE CAKES IN MY FAN OVEN ALTHOUGH IT IS TURNED A LITTLE LOWER 
I FIND THE TOP DRIES OUT BEFORE THE INSIDE HAS BAKED 
O. K. DID YOU HEAR THAT GUYS SO YOU SAID IT'S A LITTLE BIT LOWER 
SO ABOUT TWENTY DEGREES CLOSER TO NORMAL OVENS YES 
IT DOES SOUND TO ME THAT YOU'RE STILL COOKING IT TOO HIGH 
FUNNILY ENOUGH RICHARD AND I WERE TALKING THE OTHER DAY 
IT MIGHT BE THAT YOU NEED TO GET YOUR OVEN SERVICED 
WHEN WAS IT LAST SERVICED THE OVEN IS ONLY ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD 
YOU NEED TO CHECK THAT THE TEMPERATURE IS CORRECT 
BECAUSE IT STILL SOUNDS TO ME THAT IT IS TOO HIGH 
WHAT I DO WHEN I'M COOKING THEM IS I TURN THE OVEN OFF HALFWAY THROUGH COOKING 
IT DOES TAKE LONGER TO COOK THEM BUT YOU GET A MUCH BETTER QUALITY CAKE 
SO GO HIGHER AT THE BEGINNING RATHER THAN A CONSISTENT TEMPERATURE ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
HIGHER AT THE BEGINNING GET THE RISE GET IT AERATED 
THEN TURN THE OVEN OFF AND IT WILL COOK ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
DON'T OPEN THE OVEN IT WILL CONTINUE COOKING AND BE NICE AND MOIST IN THE CENTRE 
AND COOKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH IF YOU OPEN THE OVEN 
IT SINKS IN THE MIDDLE AND YOU DON'T WANT A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE 
GET IT SERVICED THOUGH 
AS YOU WERE SAYING THE OTHER DAY YOU GET YOUR CAR SERVICED BUT NOT YOUR OVEN 
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO THAT THOUGH SO MANY OF US 
WE'VE GOT OUR OVENS AT HOME ALL THIS LOVELY EQUIPMENT AND NEVER GET THEM SERVICED 
YOU BUY THEM AND THINK THEY'RE GOING TO WORK ALL THE TIME 
IT WON'T COST THAT MUCH LET US KNOW HOW YOU GO
