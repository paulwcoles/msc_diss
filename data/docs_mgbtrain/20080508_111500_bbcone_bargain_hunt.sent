YOUR EXPERT AWAITS AND OFF YOU GO AND VERY VERY GOOD LUCK 
JOINING OUR BATTLE HARDENED TEAMS TODAY 
ARE THE EVER SO REFINED EXPERTS 
MARAUDING FOR THE REDS IS 
PILLAGING FOR THE BLUES WE HAVE 
IS THIS PLAYTIME FOR VIKINGS YES IT IS 
WELL LOOK AT THIS OH THAT IS SUPERB THAT'S BEAUTIFUL 
I THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY OF YOU DAGGERS 
AS A SORT OF CLOAK THING THAT'D LOOK VERY NICE 
THAT'D LOOK STUNNING IT WOULD LOOK GOOD 
IT IS IN FACT A BUCKLE 
VERY SIMPLE CONSTRUCTION 
AND THIS WOULD HAVE HAD MATERIAL GOING THROUGH IT 
SO YOU LINK IT ROUND THE WAIST AND IT COULD OBVIOUSLY BE ADJUSTABLE 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW 
IS THIS SORT OF CELTIC DESIGN HERE CAN YOU SEE THAT 
THIS BIRD IN THE FOLIAGE CAN YOU SEE IT 
VIKINGS WERE VERY BIG ON BIRDS AND ANIMALS INTERWOVEN IN THEIR KNOTWORK 
RIGHT O. K. I THINK THIS IS EXCELLENT 
IT'S SILVER CAST SILVER 
THERE'S A HALLMARK THERE AND ALSO THERE 
YOU CAN HARDLY SEE IT IT'S IN THE INTRICATE TAPESTRY 
THAT IS FOR BIRMINGHAM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINE WOW 
IT HAS SOME AGE 
OFTEN THEY'RE CALLED NURSES' BUCKLES 
BECAUSE NURSES SEEMED TO ADOPT THESE WITH THE OLD FASHIONED UNIFORMS 
BUT THIS WAS A FASHIONABLE ITEM AROUND NINETEEN HUNDRED 
THAT'S LOVELY REALLY NICE 
YOU CAN HAVE THIS GUESS HOW MUCH 
FIFTY 
THIRTY 
I COULD MAKE A PROFIT FIFTY QUID 
IT'S TWENTY OH WOW YES AND IT'S SOLID SILVER BRILLIANT 
WILL YOU GET YOUR VIKING HORDES TO COME ALONG WE WILL 
RIGHT LET ME GO AND SEAL THE DEAL 
BUT YOU LIKE IT WE DO WE LOVE IT 
I THINK IT'LL BE A PROFIT 
EVERYBODY'S HEARD ABOUT THE BIRD 
BIRD BIRD BIRD BIRD BIRD'S THE WORLD 
BIRD BIRD BIRD THE BIRD IS THE WORD 
BIRD BIRD BIRD WELL THE BIRD IS THE WORD 
I LIKE THIS OH THAT'S NICE ISN'T IT 
WHAT APPEALS TO YOU ABOUT IT 
I LIKE THE COLOURS I LIKE THE BLUES ESPECIALLY 
NICE EARTHY COLOURS AREN'T THEY REAL RICH BLUE ON IT 
EVEN WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE MARK I CAN TELL IT'S ROYAL DOULTON 
THIS DATES FROM THE EARLY PART OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
WITH THE NICE SLIP DESIGN ON IT 
AND IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF A PAIR 
FROM THE EARLY PART OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
IF WE LOOK JUST TO CONFIRM 
THERE'S THE ROYAL DOULTON MARK WITH THE SHAPE NUMBER 
AND THEN SOME ARTIST MARKS 
DO YOU KNOW WHO THE ARTIST IS I DON'T THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BIG NAMES 
OFTEN ON THESE TYPES OF PIECES 
DOULTON WOULD ALLOW THEIR ASSISTANTS TO HELP DECORATE PIECES 
AS A SORT OF LEARNING EXERCISE 
DO YOU LIKE IT LIVVY I DO YES IT'S VERY TACTILE 
AND I LIKE THINGS THAT ARE TACTILE IT'S RATHER NICE 
MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW MUCH IS IT 
IT'S FIFTY FIFTY 
WELL NOT OVER THE TOP BUT I THINK YOU NEED 
TO TALK THE DEALERS INTO LOWERING IT A BIT IF YOU CAN 
DO YOU THINK IT'LL MAKE A PROFIT 
IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU GET IT FOR 
IF I WERE PUTTING IT INTO AN AUCTION MYSELF 
I'D PUT AN ESTIMATE OF FIFTY TO EIGHTY ON IT 
IF WE CAN GET IT FOR A BIT LESS 
IT MIGHT STAND A CHANCE IT'S A VERY NICE LOOKING PIECE 
IT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT'S GRABBED MY ATTENTION 
IF IT'S GRABBED YOU IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME 
LIVVY AND ORK BOTH GRIPPED AND GRABBED THE VASE FOR FORTY 
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT YOUR ANTIQUES ARE WORTH 
WHY NOT TRY OUR WEBSITE AND LOOK AT THE PRICE GUIDE 
WHO KNOWS YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME VIKING TREASURE 
DAVID DAGMAR I'VE FOUND A BESWICK HORSE 
AND YOU WANTED ONE 
YOU SAY BEZZICK NOT BEZ WICK 
IS THAT HOW YOU SAY IT I'VE SAID BEZZICK ALL MY LIFE 
I'VE BEEN CORRECTED SO MANY TIMES 
BUT ALSO EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT BESWICK POTTERY 
IT'S VERY ELEGANT QUITE SOPHISTICATED 
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S COLLECTIBLE AT THE MOMENT 
WOULD YOU HAVE BOUGHT THAT FOR YOURSELF I WOULD HAVE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
HAVE YOU CHECKED IT'S O. K. I'VE HAD A QUICK LOOK 
RIGHT EARS ARE O. K. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LEGS 
BECAUSE THESE ARE FRAGILE IT IS NICE AND PEOPLE DO COLLECT THESE 
THESE HORSES ARE VERY POPULAR WHAT'S THE PRICE ON IT SEVENTY 
OOH 
IT'S RATHER A LOT OF MONEY WE COULD TRY AND KNOCK THEM DOWN 
IF YOU CAN GET IT FOR SOMETHING UNDER FIFTY 
THERE'S A CHANCE OF MAKING A PROFIT WE HAVE TO MAKE A PROFIT YES 
TWENTY TWENTY I DON'T THINK SO 
DO YOU LIKE THIS YEAH WELL YOU'VE GOT GOOD TASTE LET'S GO FOR IT 
THE REDS RODE OFF WITH THE HORSE FOR THIRTY FIVE 
MARK YES I LIKE THIS REALLY 
I LOVE IT WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT IT THE PLATES THEY'RE SQUARE 
IT REMINDS ME OF BEING A KID HAVING TEA AT GRANDMA'S 
CRUMPETS BUTTER LOADS OF CAKE IT'S JUST I LOVE THE COLOURS 
WE ALL LIKE A BIT OF CRUMPET DON'T WE 
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT COS THIS DATES FROM THE LATE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
SO THAT WOULD FIT IN WITH THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE STILL HAD TEA SETS 
WHICH THEY WOULD LAY OUT AND HAVE AFTERNOON TEA AND ALL THOSE GOODIES THAT YOU MENTIONED 
BUT IT LOOKS AS IF IT'S BY QUITE A SMALL FACTORY 
YES TUSCAN CHINA MADE IN ENGLAND 
IT IS PARTLY HAND PAINTED 
THE DESIGN IS TRANSFER PRINTED ON AND THEN COLOURED OVER BY HAND 
IN THESE RATHER THICK ENAMELS 
I WAS WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS HAND PAINTED YES PARTLY 
IT'S WHAT WE TEND TO CALL DECORATED WHICH COVERS THE TRANSFER PRINTING AND HAND PAINTING 
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF IT ISN'T THERE IT'S GOT A TEAPOT 
AND YOU VERY RARELY GET TEA SETS WITH TEAPOTS YOU'RE RIGHT 
IT DOESN'T HAVE A MILK JUG AS FAR AS I CAN SEE HOW MUCH IS IT 
TWENTY FIVE 
WELL IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY IS IT FOR ALL THIS CHINA NO 
BUT I RECKON AS YOU'RE A PAIR OF VIKING MARAUDERS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO AND BULLY HER DOWN A BIT 
YEP I THINK ORK CAN HAGGLE THAT DOWN ABSOLUTELY THAT'S MY JOB 
ORK HAGGLED THE TEA SET DOWN TO FIFTEEN 
DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL YOU THAT THERE AREN'T BARGAINS ABOUT IN THESE FAIRS 
COS THERE JOLLY WELL ARE 
TAKE THIS FOR SIZE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
FIRST THING TO NOTICE IS IT'S HINGED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE 
IN INDIA ROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TO NINETEEN HUNDRED AT THE TIME OF THE BRITISH RAJ 
THE BRITS TRAVELLING OUT TO INDIA WOULD HAVE GONE ON THE P. AND AMP O. STEAMER 
AND SAT IN A CHAIR LIKE THAT ON DECK LATER ON IN INDIA 
THEY TOLD THE LOCAL WORKMEN MAKE ME A STEAMING CHAIR JUST LIKE THE ONE WE TRAVELLED OUT TO INDIA ON 
AND THIS IS WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH IT'S MADE 
OF SOLID TEAK WHICH IS A MARVELLOUS TIMBER BECAUSE YOU CAN LEAVE IT OUT ALL SUMMER AND WINTER 
AND IN FACT IF THIS CHAIR WAS LEFT OUT FOR A COUPLE OF SUMMERS 
IT WOULD LOSE THAT NUT BROWN COLOUR AND GO SILVERY GREY 
AND ACTUALLY LAST FOR YEARS AND YEARS WITHOUT CREOSOTING OR ROTTING 
IT LOOKS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THESE LITTLE SLATS BUT I TELL YOU 
IT'S ACTUALLY EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE LOVELY FOR LOUNGING ON 
AND ENJOYING A GIN AND TONIC 
SO YOU'VE GOT SOME HISTORY YOU'VE GOT A BIT OF GARDEN FURNITURE WHICH IS USEFUL 
AND YOU'VE ALSO GOT A BARGAIN WHY WELL THIS IS PRICED AT FORTY FIVE 
GOSH THAT'S CHEAP 
DAGGERS ANNETTE HAVE A LOOK AT THIS 
SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT UNUSUAL 
DO YOU HAVE ANY ASSOCIATION WITH COVENTRY YES ACTUALLY WE DO 
BACK IN JULY LAST YEAR 
I DID A SHOW THERE AT WILLENHALL WOODS AND I FIRST MET ANNETTE THERE 
IT'S TRUE OH HOW LOVELY 
THIS IS INTERESTING 
BECAUSE IT'S WOVEN BY THOMAS STEVENS OF COVENTRY RIGHT 
IN THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY COVENTRY HAD A SILK WEAVING INDUSTRY 
AND THEY MADE RIBBONS FOR HATS LADIES' FASHIONS 
ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT MARKET DISAPPEARED 
THOMAS STEVENS REINVENTED RIBBONS AND STARTED PRODUCING BOOKMARKS 
IT IS WOVEN COLOURED SILKS AND THEY COMMEMORATE THINGS 
THIS ONE IS IN SUCH BRILLIANT CONDITION 
IT'S GOT A VIEW OF COVENTRY OLD COVENTRY 
WITH THE THREE SPIRES OH YES I SEE 
ONLY ONE CHURCH SURVIVES INTACT THE OTHERS INCLUDING THE CATHEDRAL ARE IN RUINS 
AND WE'VE GOT THE DETAILS HERE 
COVENTRY AND MIDLAND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIAL AND ART EXHIBITION 
OPENED JUNE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN 
AND THE PRESIDENT WAS THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD LEIGH 
THERE'S A PORTRAIT AND THEN STONELEIGH ABBEY WHERE HE LIVED 
SO WE'VE GOT ALL THIS COMBINED ON ONE RIBBON 
THAT IS IN SUCH WONDERFUL CONDITION IT IS SO FRAGILE 
I'M GOING TO LIFT IT OUT OF THE CASE BUT TO HANDLE IT I'M VERY NERVOUS BE VERY CAREFUL 
IT'S RATHER WINDY 
WELL THERE WE ARE WOW THAT IS FINE ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL 
AND THE COLOURS ARE BRILLIANT THIS HAS BEEN FOLDED IN A BOOK 
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S EVER BEEN USED AS A BOOKMARK 
IT LOOKS VERY FRESH DOESN'T IT THAT'S THE TERM FRESH 
IT LOOKS VERY FRESH INDEED A COLLECTOR'S ITEM I KNOW PEOPLE 
WHO WILL BUY THIS WOW 
BECAUSE THEY'RE STEVENGRAPH COLLECTORS THIS IS BEAUTIFUL 
EVEN THE BACK'S TIDY YEAH THAT'S SO NICE IT'S GOOD 
OH AND LOOK 
JUST AT THE TOP THERE I WAS RIGHT THOMAS STEVENS 
DO YOU SEE THAT 
THAT'S AMAZING WE'VE GOT TO GET IT ABSOLUTELY 
I THINK THE PRICE IS NINETY FIVE 
WHICH IS TOO MUCH TO SELL AT AUCTION AND MAKE A PROFIT RIGHT 
IF YOU ALLOW ME TO NEGOTIATE YOU CAN GET IT DOWN I'M SURE YOU CAN 
I COME FROM JUST OUTSIDE COVENTRY SO I'LL PLAY ON THAT YES 
DAVID'S LOCAL KNOWLEDGE REALLY PAID OFF AND HE GOT THE RIBBON FOR FIFTY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS GUYS 
DO YOU WANT AN HONEST OPINION OF COURSE I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY DETESTABLE 
WELL I DON'T WANT YOU TO HOLD BACK I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT YOU FEEL 
SO THIS IS A NO NO I HATE IT WITH A PASSION WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND 
THESE OH THOSE ARE RATHER NICE 
WHY DID YOU LIKE THEM THE COLOURS THE WAY THEY SHINE IT'S IRIDESCENT 
DO YOU THINK THE DATE'S RIGHT ON THE LITTLE TAG 
I THINK SO MID TWENTIETH CENTURY 
THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY COFFEE SPOONS COS THEY'VE GOT THE LITTLE COFFEE BEANS THEY WILL BE SILVER GILT 
AND THEY'RE IN A FITTED BOX BUT QUITE A NICE SET 
ARE THOSE HALLMARKS YES THEY WILL BE 
I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT ONE WOULD DO WITH THEM THESE DAYS THIS IS THE TROUBLE 
WE DON'T DRINK COFFEE IN THE SAME WAY YOU'D PUT THE COFFEE IN BUT NOT USE THEM TO STIR 
NO YOU WOULD STIR WITH THEM YOU WOULDN'T PUT THE SPOON INTO THE COFFEE 
YOU'D HAVE A COFFEE POT TO POUR IT INTO THE CUP AH 
THERE WAS NO NESCAFE IN THOSE DAYS YOU SEE 
FRESH COFFEE WHAT DOES ONE DO WITH THEM NOW PEOPLE COLLECT SPOONS 
THEY'RE ALWAYS BUYING THEM AND PUTTING THEM IN LITTLE DISPLAY RACKS 
I LOVE THEM I WOULD NOT HAVE THESE SHUT IN A DRAWER 
YOU'RE DETERMINED AREN'T YOU I AM YES I'M PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN WITH A FIRM HAND 
BEFORE YOU PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN WITH A FIRM HAND HOW MUCH ARE THEY 
THEY A R. E. ONE TWENTY FIVE OH GOSH 
WELL I THINK I NEED A SEAT LET ALONE A FIRM HAND 
YOU NEED TO GET THAT DOWN O. K. TO STAND A REALISTIC CHANCE OF MAKING ANY MONEY 
BUT YOU DO LIKE THEM AND IF IT IS SOMETHING YOU LIKE 
I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE A WORD WITH THE DEALER TRY AND GET THEM DOWN 
AND WE'LL CROSS OUR FINGERS AT AUCTION 
DO YOU THINK OUR VIKING TEAMS TODAY WILL MAKE A PROFIT 
OR ARE THEY GOING TO NEED A HELPING HAND 
WELL THEIR EXPERTS ARE GOING TO TAKE THE LEFTOVER LOLLY OUT OF THE THREE HUNDRED 
AND ARE GOING TO BUY A BONUS BUY THAT COULD MAKE OR BREAK THE TEAMS AT THE AUCTION EXCITING ISN'T IT 
LET'S HAVE A REMINDER OF WHAT THE REDS DID BUY 
DAGMAR AND ANNETTE

SO THEY COUGHED UP TWENTY 
THIRTY FIVE PAID HOPEFULLY THE REDS WON'T BE HAVING A MARE

THERE YOU GO THERE'S ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE VERY NICE 
GOT ANY IDEAS A LOT OF MONEY ABSOLUTELY NO IDEAS WHATSOEVER 
WHAT'S NEW THEN EXACTLY 
OFF YOU GO VERY GOOD LUCK 
WE'LL FIND OUT HOW HE GETS ON AT THE AUCTION RIGHT NOW WE'LL SEE SOMETHING I COOKED UP EARLIER 
WHO LIVED IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
THIS PLACE USED TO BE AN ABBEY 
IT WAS CONVERTED INTO A HOUSE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
LET'S LOOK AT THE CLUES 
A SINISTER CUP MADE OUT OF HUMAN SKULL 
ITS OWNER CLEARLY HAD A VERY STRANGE SENSE OF HUMOUR 
IN A BEDROOM A BED IS A PROMINENT FEATURE 
MAYBE SUGGESTING A BIT OF A ROMANTIC 
NO SEX PLEASE WE'RE BRITISH 
A PLAYER OF SPORTS 
FINALLY A PILE OF BOOKS OUR PERSON WAS VERY WELL READ 
AND OFTEN JOTTED HIS THOUGHTS DOWN TOO 
SO DO YOU KNOW WHO LIVED IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
THE ANSWER IS THE ENGLISH ROMANTIC POET GEORGE GORDON BYRON 
BYRON WAS A FASCINATING CHARACTER WHOSE PERSONAL LIFESTYLE 
WAS ALMOST AS INTERESTING AS HIS LITERARY WORKS 
HE WAS THE SUPER ROCK STAR OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THIS IS NEWSTEAD ABBEY 
IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE BYRON TOOK UP RESIDENCY HERE 
SHORTLY BEFORE HIS TWENTY FIRST BIRTHDAY 
IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THE MACHIAVELLIAN MAESTRO STARTED HIS REIGN OF WILD NIGHTS 
FAST WOMEN AND ALL OUT ROCK'N'ROLL 
NEWSTEAD ABBEY REALLY WAS THE BEST RAVE IN TOWN 
HE USED THE GREAT HALL FOR PISTOL PRACTICE 
AND IT'S SAID THAT BEHIND THESE OAK PANELS ARE THE ORIGINAL GUNSHOT HOLES 
IN THE ABBEY DINING ROOM 
HE USED TO PRACTISE HIS BOXING FENCING AND BATTLEDORE 
HE WAS ALSO A VERY KEEN CRICKETER AND COULD OFTEN BE SEEN AT THE CREASE IN THE GARDEN 
HOWZAT 
BYRON LOVED HIS SPORT BUT HE NEVER LET IT GET IN THE WAY OF WHAT HE LIKED DOING BEST 
PARTYING HARD 
BYRON AND HIS FRIENDS USED TO GET UP INTO THEIR ABBEY HABITS 
AND COME INTO THIS CHAPEL 
TO DRINK COPIOUS QUANTITIES OF WINE OUT OF THEIR CRANIUM CUP 
THEN GO FOR A QUICK FROLIC IN THE MONASTIC PLUNGE POOL NEXT DOOR 
THERE WE HAVE HIM A POET A ROMANTIC AND A HELL RAISING ROCKER 
WHO WOULD HAVE PUT OZZY OSBOURNE TO SHAME 
GEORGE GORDON BYRON WE SALUTE YOU 
MORE POETRY IN MOTION 
OVER TO MELLORS AND KIRK AUCTION HOUSE IN NOTTINGHAM 
WHERE OUR TWO TEAMS WILL BE HOPING TO HIT THE TARGET 
AND WE'RE WITH NIGEL KIRK PROPRIETOR AND SUPREMO IS THAT RIGHT ABSOLUTELY WELCOME 
GREAT TO BE HERE NOW DAGMAR AND ANNETTE 
WENT WITH THIS BESWICK HORSE ANY GOOD 
BESWICK IS AN EXTREMELY SOUGHT AFTER AND COLLECTIBLE FACTORY 
BUT THIS IS A RELATIVELY COMMON MODEL IT WAS IN PRODUCTION OVER A LONG PERIOD 
AND LIKE MOST OF THE BESWICK HORSES 
WAS MODELLED BY ARTHUR GREDINGTON 
BUT OF COURSE WHAT DETERMINES THE VALUE IS THE COLOURWAY 
AND I'M AFRAID BROWN IS THE MOST COMMON OF ALL 
SO WHAT'S IT WORTH TWENTY TO THIRTY THIRTY FIVE THEY PAID 
NOW THIS SO CALLED CELTIC STYLE BUCKLE CAST SILVER YES 
HANDY IF YOU'RE IN THE NURSING TRADE 
YES IT'S A TYPICAL NURSE'S WAIST CLASP AND EACH PART IS HALLMARKED 
AS IT SHOULD BE MM BUT IT'S A VERY POOR QUALITY ONE CRUDELY CAST AND PIERCED HOW MUCH 
TWENTY OR THIRTY I'M AFRAID O. K. TWENTY THEY PAID SO THAT'S ALL RIGHT 
NOW WHAT ABOUT THIS SO CALLED STEVENGRAPH TELL US ABOUT MR. STEVENS OF COVENTRY 
THESE BEAUTIFUL MINIATURE PICTURES WHICH ARE KNOWN AS STEVENGRAPHS 
AND A HUGE VARIETY OF BOOKMARKS SUCH AS WE HAVE HERE 
AND I SUPPOSE IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GREAT NINETEENTH CENTURY INVENTIONS 
FOR WHICH ENGLAND BECAME SO FAMOUS 
COS WE PRODUCED THE MACHINE THAT PRODUCED THE OBJECTS THAT SEEMED TO BE A BIT OF A MIRACLE 
IT IS A LOVELY THING AND IN SPARKLING CONDITION 
WITH A VIEW OF COVENTRY CATHEDRAL OF COURSE THAT IS NO LONGER 
AND IT RELATES TO LORD LEIGH OF STONELEIGH SO IT'S LOCAL TO THE AREA IN WHICH IT WAS MADE 
WELL NEXT STEP HAVE A LOOK AT THEIR BONUS BUY 
ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT THIS ABSOLUTELY YOUR WHOLE FUTURE PROFITABILITY 
COULD HANG ON WHAT DAVID BARBY IS GOING TO REVEAL NOW 
HE HAD ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE TO SPEND 
YES YES O. K. WHAT DID YOU SPEND IT ON 
THAT'S A NICE CLOCK IT IS 
A NICE LITTLE CARRIAGE CLOCK EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE FOR 
THEY HUNG IN A CARRIAGE THE BEAUTY OF THIS PIECE IS 
THAT WHEN YOU GOT IT TO THE HOTEL OR THE HOUSE YOU WERE STAYING AT 
IT HAS AN ALARM SO YOU SET IT FOR SEVEN A M. DEPENDING WHEN THE SHOOT WAS 
AND THEN YOU WOULD SET IT AT THE BACK HERE AND IT STRIKES HERE 
I LIKE THAT SO THERE'S A BONUS IN THE FACT THAT IT STRIKES ON A COIL 
AND ALSO IT'S AN ALARM VERY GOOD SALESMAN ISN'T HE 
DID YOU SELL INSURANCE IN ANOTHER LIFE 
I DID 
I KNEW THAT CAN I MENTION ENDOWMENT POLICIES NO DON'T MENTION THEM 
YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE THREE IN YOUR POCKET PASS IT OVER AND LET DAGMAR HAVE A LOOK 
A RAVE REVIEW FOR YOUR CARRIAGE CLOCK NICE AND HEAVY 
NICE QUALITY HOW MUCH I PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOR IT 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THAT'S NOT BAD 
YOU RATE CARRIAGE CLOCKS FROM THE STANDARD MODEL 
WHICH WOULD BE A WHITE FACE WITH NO ALARM NO STRIKE NO REPEATER 
THIS ONE GOES UP A LEVEL IT'S AN ALARM AND A STRIKER AS WELL 
IT'S THE G. T. I. OF CARRIAGE CLOCKS IT'S GOT THE SUNSHINE ROOF THE GO FASTER STRIPES ALLOY WHEELS 
YES YES GO FOR IT 
SO HOW OLD IS IT 
DATE WISE IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINETEEN HUNDRED OW WOW 
THINK IN TERMS OF THE LATE VICTORIAN EDWARDIAN HOUSE PARTY YES 
EVERY GUEST WOULD HAVE ONE OF THESE LOVELY HOW MUCH PROFIT 
I'D LIKE TO SEE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED 
SO THERE COULD BE FIFTY PROFIT IN IT COULD BE 
WOW IT'S AMAZING ISN'T IT 
WHEN I WAS CATALOGUING THESE THINGS NIGH ON TWENTY YEARS AGO 
AN ALARUM CARRIAGE CLOCK EVEN IN A TATTY OLD BOX LIKE THAT 
WAS ALWAYS WORTH TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ABSOLUTELY 
SO I'M FEELING VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT 
TWENTY YEARS AGO WAS THE TIME TO SELL THEM CARRIAGE CLOCKS 
ARE VERY SOUGHT AFTER BUT REALLY FOR THE ONES WHICH ARE 
SOPHISTICATED OR OF PARTICULARLY FINE QUALITY IN TERMS OF THE CASE WORK 
THIS IS A VERY WELL MADE AND VERY TYPICAL LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY FRENCH CARRIAGE CLOCK 
THE MOST IMPORTANT FACT ABOUT THIS CLOCK 
IS THAT IT'S RETAINED ITS ORIGINAL ESCAPEMENT ALL TOO OFTEN 
THE CLOCKS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO A REPAIRER WHO'VE SIMPLY UNBOLTED 
THE NUTS THERE WHIPPED OFF THE ESCAPEMENT AND PUT IN A NEW ONE 
THAT RUINS THE VALUE 
THAT'S GOT THE ORIGINAL PLATFORM 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PAID WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATE 
WELL I'D GIVE IT A TENTATIVE ESTIMATE OF EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
WHICH IS PROBABLY A LITTLE MEAN AND I HOPE IT'D DO BETTER 
A LITTLE MEAN SERIOUSLY THOUGH THE PRICES HAVE COME DOWN FROM FIFTEEN YEARS AGO 
IT MIGHT MAKE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
YES IT MIGHT 
BUT WHAT WILL BE IN STORE FOR OUR BLUES 
ORK AND LIVVY WENT WITH THIS DOULTON POT 
YES TUBE LINE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
IT ACTUALLY MEANS RATHER LIKE ICING A CAKE THE DESIGN IS IN RELIEF 
AND DIFFERENT COLOURED GLAZES OCCUPY THE SPACES 
IT REMINDS ME IN SOME RESPECTS OF CLOISONNE ENAMELLING 
THIS WAS MADE AT A TIME WHEN DOULTON WERE MASS PRODUCING 
THEIR WARES IN LAMBETH IT'S QUITE STYLISH ISN'T IT IT IS 
IT'S A SHAME THERE ISN'T A PAIR TO IT WHICH I'M SURE IT ONCE HAD 
YES VALUE FORTY TO SIXTY 
O. K. FORTY PAID THAT'S A RELIEF THERE'S POTENTIALLY A PROFIT THERE 
I WOULD HOPE SO BRILLIANT 
NOW A TEA SET FOR TEN 
THIS IS R. H. PLANT'S TUSCAN CHINA 
THEY WERE ONE OF THE LARGEST PRODUCERS OF BONE CHINA TEA WARE 
FROM THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND FORTIES THROUGH TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
BUT IN COMMON WITH MOST OF THESE MASS PRODUCED TEA SERVICES 
THE GILDING IS RATHER HARSH AND METALLIC 
IT'S NOT TERRIBLY GOOD QUALITY 
BUT QUITE A FEW PIECES THERE HOW MUCH 
THIRTY TO FORTY GREAT FIFTEEN PAID 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE YOU CAN GET A WHOLE SERVICE LIKE THAT FOR FIFTEEN 
ABSOLUTELY SO WE'VE GOT TWO POTENTIAL PROFITS THERE NOW 
THE PRETTY COFFEE SPOONS THEY ARE PRETTY AREN'T THEY 
THEY'RE SILVER GILT 
AND GUILLOCHE ENAMELLED 
IN DIFFERENT COLOURS WHICH MEANS THEY'RE A HARLEQUIN SET 
THEY'RE HALLMARKED BIRMINGHAM NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE 
AND WOULD BE LIKELY TO BE POPULAR IN TODAY'S MARKET 
THEY'RE PRETTY BUT I'M AFRAID THEY'RE UNPOPULAR 
ALTHOUGH THESE ARE IN GOOD CONDITION 
BUYERS TEND TO BE CONCERNED 
THAT THEY ARE SO TERRIBLY FRAGILE THEY COULD EASILY BE DAMAGED 
SO I THINK TWENTY TO THIRTY IS ABOUT OH DEAR NINETY THEY PAID 
TOO MUCH TOO MUCH DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN NEED OF THE BONUS BUY 
MARK HAD ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE YES MARK YES I DID WHAT DID YOU SPEND IT ON 
I SPENT IT ON THIS TIM 
WHICH IS A TELESCOPE BRASS AND LEATHER EMBOSSED 
AND A LITTLE COMPASS IN THE TOP THERE 
MADE ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED OR SO 
I ONLY SPENT FORTY ON IT 
DO YOU SPY A PROFIT WITH IT 
WELL YES I HOPE SO I WOULD HOPE SIXTY OR EIGHTY MAYBE 
SIXTY OR EIGHTY YES EVEN WITH THE BIT OF DAMAGE 
YES BECAUSE IT'S UNUSUAL YOU DON'T OFTEN GET A COMPASS FITTED 
IF THE COMPASS IS IN THE TOP HOW DO YOU SEE OUT TAKE THE COVER OFF 
VERY VERY EASY 
IT'S LIKE A LENS COVER ON THE END ALL RIGHT 
LET'S SAY THAT YOU'RE TRAVELLING AROUND 
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN YOU'D HAVE THAT ON 
AND YOU'D GET ON WITH IT ANYWAY WE ARE SEEING THEN MARK 
TWENTY PERHAPS PROFIT YES I HOPE SO 
YOU GUYS AT HOME CAN FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT IT 
I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE ABSOLUTELY 
SOMETHING BEGINNING WITH PROFIT HERE 
IT'S AN INTERESTING TELESCOPE YOU CAN'T SEE THROUGH IT 
UNLESS YOU REMOVE THE LENS CAP WHICH INCORPORATES A COMPASS 
AND THAT IS MOST UNUSUAL 
I SUSPECT THAT THIS WAS PERHAPS INTENDED FOR 
A LATE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN CYCLIST REALLY 
IT'S A POCKET SIZED TELESCOPE BEAUTIFULLY MADE OF BRASS 
AND COVERED IN MOROCCO LEATHER 
THE BRASS IS LACQUERED TO PROTECT THE METAL 
IN PLACES YOU CAN SEE THE LACQUER HAS WORN AWAY 
SADLY THE COMPASS GLASS HAS BEEN BROKEN 
BUT THE COMPASS IS NICELY MADE 
IT'S A PITY WE CAN'T PUT A NAME TO IT IT'S COMPLETELY ANONYMOUS 
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH THIRTY OR FORTY GREAT FORTY THEY PAID 
AND IF YOU GOT AN OLD BIKER ABOUT THEY MAY PAY MORE DEFINITELY 
EVERY COUNTRY AUCTION IS LITTERED UP WITH PILES AND PILES OF BRASSWARE 
THIS IS A PRETTY TYPICAL PLAQUE 
IT WAS NEVER MADE TO HOLD BREAD OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BACK IT'S GOT A LITTLE HANGING TERMINAL 
THIS THING WAS TO JOLLY UP THE INTERIOR OF YOUR COTTAGE 
MADE IN AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY PROBABLY STAMPED OUT IN BIRMINGHAM 
THE CAPITAL CITY OF BRASS MANUFACT URE 
AND THIS HAS BEEN DECORATED WITH A SERIES OF INTERLOCKING SCALES 
THEY LOOK RATHER LIKE FISH SCALES DON'T THEY 
AND SOME RADIATING BANDS AROUND THE OUTER EDGE 
IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AT EACH OF THOSE BITS OF DECORATION 
THEY'RE ALL MADE UP OF A SERIES OF DOTS BECAUSE THEY WERE DECORATED BY HAND 
LITERALLY SOMEBODY STOOD AT A WORKBENCH AND WENT DOT DOT DOT 
WITH A BURIN OR ENGRAVER'S TOOL AND CREATED THOSE DESIGNS 
BUT YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THIS CHAP 
D. A. NA 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
ISN'T IT FANTASTIC 
SIMILAR IDEA 
BUT JUST ENORMOUS IN SCALE 
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS THING IS THE DECORATION 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FRONT YOU CAN SEE A TREE OF LIFE 
IT HAS A RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE 
AND SPROUTING OUT OF THE TREE OF LIFE ARE ALL THESE SCALY BRANCHES 
WITH POTENTIALLY STYLISED POMEGRANATES ON THE END 
THE OUTER BORDER'S GOT SOME MORE FISH SCALES 
AND A CONTINUOUS WIBBLY WOBBLY SNAKE TYPE DECORATION ALL THE WAY ROUND THE OUTSIDE 
TECHNICALLY IT'S AN ARTS AND CRAFTS OBJECT 
AGAIN ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN DECORATED BY HAND 
BUT IN ALL THESE SALEROOMS PEOPLE WANDER BY PILES OF BRASS LIKE THIS 
AND THEY SIMPLY DON'T LOOK AT THEM PROPERLY 
THIS IS A WORK OF ART 
TRUE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO CLEAN IT ONCE IN A WHILE 
OR HAVE IT LACQUERED SO ONCE YOU'VE HAD IT POLISHED ONCE 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO POLISH IT AGAIN 
STICK IT UP ON THAT BORING ENORMOUS CHIMNEY BREAST OF A WALL 
AND I PROMISE YOU THE WHOLE THING WILL BE JOLLIED UP 
YOU GET THESE TWO BITS IN THIS AUCTION I BET YOU NOBODY'S LOOKED AT THEM PROPERLY
