SO LET'S STOP HIM BEFORE HE FOLLOWS IN HIS BROTHER'S FOOTSTEPS 
VERNON KING HE RAN THE CHURCHILL SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX 
THE ESTATE HAS SEEN AN INCREASE IN DRUG RELATED CRIME 
AND AS YOU ALL KNOW HE DIED IN HIS BEDSIT AT THE WEEKEND 
SUSPECTED HEROIN OVERDOSE NOW THEIR LEADER MAY BE DEAD BUT THE CREW ARE STILL THERE WORKING HIS CORNERS 
WORD IS THAT KING TOOK DELIVERY OF SEVERAL KILOS JUST BEFORE HE DIED 
THAT'S A LOT OF SMACK TO SELL SO I'M HOPING THAT GREED 
AND A LACK OF LEADERSHIP WILL LEAD THEM TO BE CARELESS 
RIGHT YOU ALL KNOW YOUR TARGETS ANY QUESTIONS 
WHAT KEEP MOVING 
THIS IS MY CORNER NOW YOU FEEL ME 
O. K. LET'S STOP THE CHURCHILL ESTATE CREW BEFORE THEIR DRUGS CLAIM ANY MORE VICTIMS 
JUST HAND THOSE OUT GARY I'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS 
HOW YOU DOING 
I'M A BIT BUSY TO BE HONEST 
YEAH ABOUT TONIGHT 
YEAH WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SELLING THE FLAT 
JULIA WANTS US ALL TO GO ROUND TO HERS AFTER WORK 
SO TELL HER THAT YOU'VE GOT OTHER PLANS 
I CAN'T SHE NEEDS TO SORT THE PROBLEM OUT WITH THE CAMPUS SURGERY 
HOW VERY CONVENIENT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE FLAT TOMORROW YEAH 
HAVE I GOT ANY CHOICE 
I'VE GOT TO GO LISTEN I REALLY AM AS SERIOUS ABOUT THIS AS YOU ARE 
WHAT'S GOING ON 
SHE'S BEEN AS FIDGETY AS A BOX OF FROGS ALL MORNING 
I RECKON SHE'S TAKEN A FANCY TO THE STATIONERY GUY 
HE'S IN HIS TWENTIES 
LIFE IN THE OLD GIRL YET 
HERE WE ARE 
IS THAT IT A CAR SHE'S GONE GA GA OVER A CAR 
NO THERE MUST BE SOME REASON WHY SHE'S BOUGHT SOME SCRAP OF METAL 
SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE RELIABLE LOOK I WAS WITH HER AT THE AUCTION 
I TRIED TO PUSH HER IN THE DIRECTION OF A NICE LITTLE RUN AROUND BUT NO SHE WANTED THAT 
NICK COULD I HAVE A WORD PLEASE 
I'LL PUT THE KETTLE ON 
WHAT'S UP 
IT'S ABOUT MELODY 
PROBLEM WELL YOU TELL ME YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SUPERVISING HER 
I KNOW I SAID I'D TAKE OVER FROM JOE BUT MELODY'S A BIG GIRL NOW 
SHE DOESN'T NEED ME LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER ALL THE TIME THAT ISN'T JUST YOUR DECISION TO MAKE 
MENTORING IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF HER ONGOING TRAINING YOU KNOW THAT 
THEN MAYBE I'M NOT THE PERSON TO DO IT CAN'T GEORGE TAKE OVER 
SHE'S BUSY SUPERVISING DANIEL FOR THE G. M. C. 
O. K. WHAT ABOUT JIMMI OH YOU WANT HIM TO TAKE THIS ON AS WELL AS DOING HIS POLICE SURGEON WORK 
O. K. POINT TAKEN 
YOU'RE A PARTNER NICK ACT LIKE ONE 
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED I'VE GOT IMPORTANT THINGS ON MY PLATE TOO 
LIKE LEARNING TO WALK WE'VE ALL GOT PROBLEMS TO SORT OUT NICK 
BUT AS MY PARTNER RIGHT NOW I NEED YOU TO PULL YOUR WEIGHT 
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIS NEW SURGERY OFF THE GROUND 
DI MOORE TO ALL UNITS 
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE ALREADY ELECTED A NEW LEADER 
IT'S LEON KING VERNON'S BABY BROTHER HE'S SEVENTEEN 
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S JUST BEEN A MINOR PLAYER TILL NOW 
SO LET'S STOP HIM BEFORE HE FOLLOWS IN HIS BROTHER'S FOOTSTEPS 
REMEMBER THESE KIDS ARE STREETWISE 
WE NEED EVIDENCE OF CASH BEING EXCHANGED FOR THE DRUGS BEFORE WE CAN MOVE 
WE'VE GOT MOVEMENT 
FIVE MAYBE SIX PEOPLE APPROACHING THE CORNER 
OH NO NOT HER 
LEON LEON KING 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE 
NOTHING JUST MINDING MY OWN YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SHOULD BE 
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO END UP LIKE YOUR BROTHER 
MY BROTHER WENT OUT LIKE A MAN DOING HIS THING 
AND WHAT WAS HIS THING SELLING DRUGS WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING WHAT OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE DO LIKE WHAT 
GOING TO COLLEGE GETTING A CAREER 
THAT AIN'T FOR US 
WE WANT SOMETHING AND WE'RE GOING TO GET IT OUR OWN WAY 
THAT'S VERNON TALKING 
YEAH AND HE DIDN'T LIKE YOU OR YOUR HAPPY CLAPPY CLAN COMING ROUND HERE RUINING BUSINESS 
SO MOVE ON 
DON'T WORRY WE'RE GOING 
NEED TO PREPARE FOR VERNON'S MEMORIAL 
YOU'RE ALL WELCOME TO COME PAY YOUR LAST RESPECTS 
AND I'LL BE SAYING A SPECIAL PRAYER FOR YOU 
SAVE IT FOR SOMEONE WHO STILL BELIEVES 
YOU MAY HAVE GIVEN UP ON GOD LEON BUT THAT DON'T MEAN HE'S GIVEN UP ON YOU 
RIGHT O. K. EVERYONE LET'S REFOCUS ON THE JOB IN HAND 
I C. ONE IN SILVER CORSA APPROACHING THE TARGET 
REMEMBER WE WANT THEM ALL 
KING AND THE REST OF THE GANG 
MOVE ON MY SIGNAL 
WHAT THE HELL'S SHE DI MOORE WHAT BRINGS YOU TO THE CHURCHILL 
GET HER IN HERE NOW 
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE PLAYING AT 
JUST TAKING OUR MESSAGE TO THOSE WHO'VE FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE 
YOU'RE COMPROMISING A POLICE OPERATION 
YOU DIDN'T MENTION AN OPERATION AT THE LAST RESIDENTS' MEETING 
IN FACT YOU NEVER SEEM TO HAVE ANY ANSWERS AS TO HOW TO CURB CRIME ON THE ESTATE 
WE'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING NOW AREN'T WE BUT THIS ISN'T THE WAY 
DO YOU WANT THE DEALERS OFF THE STREET OR NOT 
I WANT TO HELP THESE CHILDREN NOT CRIMINALISE THEM 
WHEN THEY'RE LOCKED UP THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF TIME TO SAVE THEIR SOULS 
BUT IN THE MEANTIME YOU AND YOUR PRAYER PATROL STAY OUT OF MY WAY 
YOU PULL ANOTHER STUNT LIKE THAT AND I'LL ARREST YOU ALL FOR OBSTRUCTION 
WHEN YOU REALISE I'M RIGHT YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN FIND ME 
GOOD BYE 
WHAT'S HAPPENING 
BOSS WHAT'S HAPPENING 
FILTH FILTH 
IT'S TOO LATE HE'S MADE US 
O. K. ALL UNITS STAND DOWN 
I NEED A PLAN B. 
THE RADIO WORKS IT'S GOT A VERY GENEROUS GLOVE COMPARTMENT 
HOW MANY MILES ON THE CLOCK ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
BEEN ROUND THE BLOCK A FEW TIMES THEN 
RIGHT 
HAS IT BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT I'M NOT SURE THIS PAINT JOB ON THIS WING MATCHES THE REST OF THE CAR 
OH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN YEAH CUT AND SHUNT I BEG YOUR PARDON 
IT'S WHEN THEY TAKE TWO HALVES OF TWO DIFFERENT CARS AND WELD THEM TOGETHER 
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR IT AGAIN 
DO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN TAKEN FOR A RIDE 
NO NOT AT ALL LOOK IT'S OLD BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN WELL LOOKED AFTER 
YEAH PERSONALLY I'D HAVE GONE FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE SLEEK AND SPORTY OF COURSE 
OF COURSE BUT ALL IN ALL YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF A NICE LITTLE MOTOR HERE 
WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR APPROVAL 
NOW HAVEN'T YOU BOTH GOT WORK TO DO 
HOW MANY TIMES YOU GONNA TURN THE PLACE OVER 
YOU NEVER FOUND NOTHING WHEN YOU CAME TO TAKE VERNON AWAY 
WHAT YOU THINK HE GOT ALL THE BRAINS IN THE FAMILY 
HEY YOU'RE GONNA BE PAYING FOR ALL THE DAMAGES YOU KNOW THAT 
IF YOU WANNA BE A PLAYER LEON YOU'VE GOT TO GET USED TO THIS KIND OF ATTENTION 
AIN'T A BIGGIE IT'S YOU THAT'S WASTING YOUR TIME SEE 
SO MUCH FOR PLAN B. NOW WHAT 
DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU SO SOON WE'VE GOT UNFINISHED BUSINESS 
REALLY I THOUGHT WE WERE BOTH VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHERE WE STOOD 
O. K. LOOK I WAS WRONG NOT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE OPERATION BUT WE HAD TO MOVE QUICKLY 
AND THAT'S MEANT TO JUSTIFY THE DAMAGE YOU'VE DONE TO OUR WORK ON THE ESTATE NO OF COURSE NOT 
WE'VE BEEN BUILDING RELATIONS WITH THE DEALERS FOR MONTHS NOW 
OFFERING SPIRITUAL SUPPORT SO THAT WHEN WE'VE WON THEIR TRUST WE CAN TRY TO PERSUADE THEM AWAY FROM CRIME 
BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OF A REDUCED LEVEL OF DRUG DEALING 
AND YOU EXPECT RESULTS OVERNIGHT I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO BELIEVE IN MIRACLES 
LOOK I KNOW THAT GETTING KING AND THE GANG OFF THE STREETS ISN'T THE ANSWER BUT IT IS A START 
IT SENDS OUT A MESSAGE TO THE GANG AND THE RESIDENTS THAT WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT TACKLING THIS PROBLEM 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER DEALERS ON THE ESTATE WHY GO AFTER LEON 
WHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTED IN PROTECTING HIM 
BECAUSE I KNOW HE'S NOT A BAD BOY AT HEART 
HE'S SELLING DRUGS TO ANYONE WHO'LL COME UP WITH ENOUGH CASH 
HE'S TAKEN OVER FROM THE BUSINESS HIS BROTHER BUILT YES 
BUT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR VERNON'S INFLUENCE 
LEON WOULD HAVE STAYED ON AT SCHOOL AND MADE SOMETHING OF HIMSELF 
CAN'T YOU SEE I'M TIRED OF BURYING OUR YOUNG ONES AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING JUST ISN'T WORKING 
THANKS TO YOU WE'VE HAD TO CHANGE OUR PLANS KING WON'T BE DEALING ON THE STREETS FOR A WHILE NOW 
SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO WALK AWAY LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO 
NOT THIS TIME WE THINK VERNON DIED FROM SAMPLING HIS OWN GEAR 
WHETHER OR NOT HE TOOK TOO MUCH OR IT'S A DODGY BATCH WE CAN'T LEAVE THOSE DRUGS OUT THERE 
SO WHY AREN'T YOU SMASHING IN DOORS 
OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO 
BECAUSE I NEED YOUR HELP 
WE'VE SEARCHED KING'S FLAT AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF THE DRUGS 
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW IF HE HAS ACCESS TO ANY OTHER PROPERTY 
A GIRLFRIEND'S PLACE OR A LOCK UP GARAGE I ONLY KNOW ABOUT HIS FLAT 
SO MUCH FOR YOUR LOCAL KNOWLEDGE 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T FIND OUT 
BUT LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT I WON'T DO ANYTHING THAT PUTS LEON IN JAIL 
I'M ONLY INTERESTED IN GETTING THE DRUGS OFF THE STREETS 
THEN I'LL HELP BUT AS LONG AS WE DO THIS MY WAY AGREED 
THERE SHE IS THE LEWIS HAMILTON OF LETHERBRIDGE 
VERY FUNNY DOCTOR GRANGER 
WHAT YOU DOING A BIT OF CRAMMING OOH NO I'M JUST SEEING WHAT'S NEW 
THEY'RE ALWAYS MESSING ABOUT WITH THE TRAFFIC LAWS AREN'T THEY 
YEAH YOU'LL FIND A LOT OF CHANGES SINCE YOU WERE LAST ON THE ROAD 
LIKE THE INVENTION OF TRAFFIC LIGHTS 
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO STOP FOR MAIL CARRIAGES ANY MORE 
COME ON WE'RE ONLY TEASING 
YES I KNOW IT'S JUST 
WHAT 
I DIDN'T REALISE THERE WAS SO MUCH TO LEARN COME ON VIVIEN YOU'LL PASS THE THEORY TEST EASY 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PRACTICAL 
I THOUGHT I'D JUST JUMP IN THE CAR AND IT WOULD ALL COME FLOODING BACK BUT IT'S NOT THAT EASY IS IT 
YOU NEED A FRIEND TO TAKE YOU OUT FOR A FEW REFRESHERS 
GIVE YOU A BIT OF CONFIDENCE BE A CALMING INFLUENCE 
WHO WOULD THAT BE EXACTLY 
I HOPE YOU'RE ALL STILL COMING TONIGHT YEAH OH YES SURE 
GOOD WE'LL BE THERE 
WE'RE HERE TO REMEMBER THE SHORT LIFE OF ONE OF OUR OWN 
SOME OF YOU MAY ONLY REMEMBER HIM FOR THE TRAGIC NATURE OF HIS DEATH 
BUT I WANT TO REMEMBER THE HAPPY CHILD WITH THE READY SMILE 
WHAT HE BECAME LATER WASN'T ALL HIS FAULT 
HE HAD FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO TURN AWAY FROM A LIFE OF CRIME THAT SNARES SO MANY OF OUR YOUNG ONES 
IF ONLY HE COULD HAVE SEEN THAT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE FOR HIM 
LET US PRAY 
I'M GLAD EVERYONE COULD COME NOT EVERYONE'S HERE YET 
DON'T TELL ME RUTH STILL ISN'T HERE I SPOKE TO HER YESTERDAY SHE SAID SHE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO COME 
DID SHE SAY WHY A PRIOR ENGAGEMENT BUT WASN'T THIS HER IDEA 
WELL WE CAN'T WAIT FOR HER 
HAS EVERYBODY GOT A DRINK 
I'M NOT SURE THAT BUSINESS AND ALCOHOL GO TOGETHER 
EVERYONE'S GIVEN UP THEIR TIME LET'S MAKE IT PLEASANT GET THE CREATIVE JUICES FLOWING 
I'M JUST HAVING ORANGE JUICE 
RIGHT O. K. LET'S MAKE A START GUYS 
SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO RE LAUNCH THE CAMPUS SURGERY

WHY'D YOU DO IT WHY DID YOU BLOW THE POLICE OUT LIKE THAT 
COS I WANTED TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE TO SEE THE LIGHT 
LISTEN I AIN'T A KID ANY MORE I DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR FAIRY TALES 
WORKING THE CORNER IS THE ONLY OPTION YOU GOT WHEN YOU'RE BORN ON THE CHURCHILL 
YOU COULD BE THE ONE THAT GETS OFF THE ESTATE AND MAKES SOMETHING OF YOUR LIFE 
SHOW THE OTHER KIDS THAT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY MORE FAIRY TALES 
NO ONE'S SAYING IT'LL BE EASY 
BUT IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO CHANGE 
IF YOU DON'T 
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE YOUR PICTURE ON THERE 
HAVE YOU GOT FIVE MINUTES 
WHAT FOR WHAT YOU CAN'T SPARE ME A FEW MINUTES 
IT MIGHT TURN YOUR WHOLE LIFE ROUND 
WE'RE NOT GETTING VERY FAR

I DON'T THINK I WANT TO 
I MEAN WHAT ARE THEY INTO SEX 
DRUGS SEX 
HOW DO WE TAP INTO THOSE INTERESTS REFER A FRIEND AND GET A FREE C. D. 
A BOTTLE OF BEER WITH EVERY PRESCRIPTION THAT WOULD BE POPULAR 
I KNOW I KNOW FREE CONDOMS 
CAN WE JUST HAVE SERIOUS SUGGESTIONS PLEASE 
I AM BEING SERIOUS 
WHY DON'T WE JUST GO WITH THE OPEN DAY IDEA AS PLANNED UNTIL THE CORPSE PUT THE KIBOSH ON IT 
EXACTLY SO WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO SHOW OFF OUR WARES SO TO SPEAK 
WELL I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GREAT IDEA 
YEAH GOOD
