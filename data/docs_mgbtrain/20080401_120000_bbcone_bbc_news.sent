BRITONS THE DAMMING FINDINGS OF A 
REPORT INTO IMMIGRATION 
A LORDS COMMITTEE SAYS THE 
POSITIVES HAVE BEEN OVERSTATED AND 
CALLS FOR LIMITS TO MIGRANT LEVELS 
THREE DAYS ON AND STILL ZIMBABWENS 
WAIT TO FIND OUT WHO WON SATURDAY'S 
ELECTIONS ELECTIONS FROM OPTIMISM TO PESSIMISM HOPE TO 
DESPAIR ZIMBABWENS FEAR YET 
ANOTHER ELECTION IS BEING STOLEN 
FROM THEM 
HEALTH MOTS FOR THE OVER FORTIES THE 
GOVERNMENT'S LATEST PLAN TO STOP US 
FALLING SICK 
THE CORONER AT THE DIANA INQUEST 
SAYS IT'S BLINDINGLY OBVIOUS THAT 
HER FORMER BUTLER PAUL BURRELL DID 
NOT TELL THE TRUTH 
AND NINETY NOT OUT THE R. A. F. CELEBRATES 
IN STYLE 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON ON PATROL IN 
PECKHAM HARRIET HARMAN COMES UNDER 
FIRE FOR WEAR AGO STAB PROOF VEST 
IN SOUTH LONDON WITH A LACK OF 
TEACHERS IN THE CAPITAL COULD 
QUALIFIED REFUGEES BE THE ANSWER 
GOOD AFTERNOON THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
BEEN ACCUSED OF OVERSTATING THE 
ADVANTAGES OF IMMIGRATION A 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY INQUIRY FROM 
THE HOUSE OF LORDS SAYS RECORD 
NUMBERS OF IMMIGRANTS HAVE BROUGHT 
LITTLE OR NO ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO 
TO BRITAIN THE PIERCE CALLED FOR A 
LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
ALLOWED IN BUT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS 
IMMIGRANTS ARE GIVING A BOOST TO 
THE ECONOMY OUR SOCIAL AFFAIRS 
CORRESPONDENT ANDREW BOMFORD 
REPORTS REPORTS THESE ARE THE IMMIGRATION WINNERS 
ACCORDING TO THE INFLUENTIAL 
INQUIRY IT'S IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES 
WHO ARE BENEFITING MOST THESE ARE 
THE IMMIGRATION LOSSERS LOSERS 
YOUNG LOW PAID BRITONS LIKE THESE 
IN LINKS COMPETING FOR IN 
LINCOLNSHIRE COMPETING WITH JOBS 
AND SERVICES THE GOVERNMENT SAYS 
IMMIGRATION BRINGS SIX BILLION TO 
THE ECONOMY EACH YEAR THE HOUSE OF 
LORDS COMMITTEE SAYS THAT IS 
MEANINGLESS FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE 
WITH ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND NET IMMIGRATION A YEAR 
AND IF IT'S NOT DOING US ANY GOOD 
AND PRESENTING PROBLEMS IN ALL 
SORTS OF AREAS THE SOONER WE GET 
DOWN TO GET AGO RIGHT BALANCE THE 
BETTER 
THE OFFICIAL POPULATION BETTER HERE IN BOSTON IS FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND BUT THE 
LOCAL COUNCIL SAYS THAT FIGURE IS 
WRONG AND IN FACTLETS MUCH HIGHER 
IT ESTIMATES ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
ARE LIVING HERE WHY BECAUSE OF 
RAPID IMMIGRATION FROM EASTERN 
EUROPE EUROPE THIS IS ANITA AND HER FAMILY SHE 
IS FROM LATVIA AND THEY'VE JUST 
BOUGHT THIS HOUSE IN BOSTON 
THEY'RE BUILDING A LONG TERM FUTURE 
IN BRITAIN WHILE THEY'RE WORKING 
AND PAYING TAXES THEY'RE ALSO 
USING PUBLIC SERVICES LIKE THEIR 
DAUGHTER'S NURSERY SHE STARTS 
SCHOOL IN SEPTEMBER THAT WILL COST 
THE TAXPAYER ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR 
WE ARE LIVING HERE WE ARE PEOPLE 
WHO WORK FOR MINIMUM WAGE WE FEEL 
QUITE RIGHT TO USE PUBLIC SERVICES 
BECAUSE WE PAY TAXES AND INSURANCES 
ANITA WORKS AT A FACTORY MAKING INK 
JET CARTRIDGES FOR PRINTERS TWENTY 
PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED HERE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY 
PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED HERE HER BOSS 
SAYS WITHOUT A POOL OF CHEAP LABOUR 
HIS COMPANY MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORCED 
TO MANUFACTURE MANUFACTURING TO 
MOVE MANUFACTURERING TO CHINA 
WITHOUT THE INFLUX OF THE WORKERS 
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM TO 
STAY 
THEY SAY WHILE EASTERN STAY EUROPEANS CANNOT BE STOPPED FROM 
COMING TO BRITAIN THERE SHOULD BE 
A CAP ON IMMIGRATION FROM ELSEWHERE 
THIS IS A SERIOUS AND HEAVYWEIGHT 
CHALLENGE TO IMMIGRATION POLICY 
THE LORDS SAY THE GOVERNMENT MUST 
TAKE NOTICE 
LET'S GET MORE ON THIS AND SPEAK TO 
OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT REETA 
CHAKRABARTI IN DOWNING STREET IT'S 
A DAMMING REPORT WHAT RESPONSE 
FROM THE GOVERNMENT TODAY WELL WELL MINISTERS HAVE INTERESTINGLY BEEN 
UNWILLING TO ARGUE TOO STRONGLY 
WITH THE BASE I CAN FINDINGS OF THE 
HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE THEY'VE 
SAID THAT THERE IS A LOT OF COMMON 
GROUND AND THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY 
IMPLEMENTING MANY OF THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE PIERCE PUT 
FORWARD BUT THE PRIME MINISTER 
GORDON BROWN HOLDING HIS MONTHLY 
PRESS CONFERENCE HERE IN DOWNING 
STREET BEHIND ME HE DID TAKE ISSUE 
WITH THE ASSERTION THAT IMMIGRATION 
HAS BROUGHT FEW ECONOMIC BENEFITS 
TO PEOPLE LIVING IN BRITAIN THIS 
IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY 
MANY OF THESE MIGRANTS ARE TODAY 
THE HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS THAT 
HELP US FILL VACANCIES THAT EXIST 
IN THE ECONOMY AND ARE IMPORTANT TO 
THE ECONOMY SO THE HOUSE OF LORDS 
REPORT IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION 
TO THE DEBATE ABOUT THIS BUT I 
THINK WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT THE 
FIGURES AND LOOK AT THE FACTS THEY 
WILL SEE THAT OVER THE LAST TEN 
YEARS BRITISH GROWTH HAS BEEN HIGH 
IT'S BEEN HIGHER THAN MANY OTHER 
COUNTRIES THE IDEA THAT THESE 
SKILLS HAVE NOT HAD A POSITIVE 
IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY AS THE 
CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE HAS SAID IS 
WRONG 
BUT HE DOES SAY THAT WRONG CONTROLS ON IMMIGRATION ARE BEING 
TIGHTENED MAINLY WITH A NEW 
POINTS BASED SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE FROM 
OUTSIDE THE E. U. SO THAT PEOPLE WHO 
DON'T HAVE SKILLS WON'T BE ABLE TO 
COME IN 
REALISTICALLY GIVEN THE 
FREE MOVEMENT OF EUROPEAN WORKERS 
HOW MUCH ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE DOES 
THE GOVERNMENT HAVE ON THIS WELL WELL THAT DOES RESTRICT THEIR FREEDOM TO 
MOVE PRETTY SEVERELY YOU HAVE TO 
REMEMBER THAT ALL E. U. NATIONALS 
APART FROM THOSE FROM ROMANIA AND 
BULGARIA CAN COME AND WORK HERE 
THE LATEST FIGURES WE HAVE FOR TWO THOUSAND SIX 
SUGGEST THAT ABOUT HALF OF ALL THE 
IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME HERE WERE FROM 
EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES THE HOUSE 
OF LORDS COMMITTEE WANTS THE 
GOVERNMENT TO SET A CAP ON THE 
OTHER HALF IT WANTS A CEILING TO 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING IN FROM 
OUTSIDE EUROPE THAT'S A 
CONSERVATIVE POLICY AND NOT ONE 
THAT MINISTERS ARE GOING TO TAKE ON 
BOARD I THINK OVERALL THOUGH THE 
GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO ANSWER 
THOSE CALLS FOR IT TO TOUGHEN ON 
IMMIGRATION BY SAYING THAT IN MOST 
RESPECTS IT'S DOING SO ALREADY 
THANK YOU 
PRESSURE IS MOUNTING ON THE 
ZIMBABWEN GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE THE 
FULL RESULTS OF SATURDAY'S 
ELECTIONS SO FAR JUST OVER HALF 
THE PARLIAMENTARY RESULTS HAVE BEEN 
DECLARED AND NONE FOR THE 
PRESIDENTIAL VOTE OF THE TWO HUNDRED TEN 
PARLIAMENTARY SEATS UP FOR GRABS 
ZIMBABWE'S ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
SAYS MR. MUGABE'S ZANU P. F. PARTY HAS 
SIXTY FOUR SEATS WHILE THE OPPOSITION 
MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE 
PARTY HAS SIXTY TWO IN THE PRESIDENTIAL 
RACE EARLY INDICATIONS ARE THAT 
THERE COULD BE A SECOND ROUND 
RUNOFF BETWEEN ROBERT MUGABE AND 
THE OPPOSITION'S MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
THE B. B. C. IS ONE OF THE BROADCASTERS 
BANNED FROM REPORTING INSIDE 
ZIMBABWE BUT GEORGE ALAGIAH IS ON 
THE BORDER WITH SOUTH AFRICA FOR US 
AS YOU SAID I AM HERE AT THE BORDER 
RATHER NOISY BORDER IT HAS TO BE 
SAID BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA AND 
ZIMBABWE BEYOND ME THERE THIS IS 
PLACE WHERE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ZIMBABWENS 
HAVE GONE BACK INTO THEIR COUNTRY 
AND WHEN THEY WENT THEY WENT IN THE 
HOPE OF WINNING THEIR COUNTRY BACK 
FROM THE DESPOTIY RULE OF ROBERT 
MUGABE I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO SOME 
AS THEY COME BACK IT HAS TO BE 
SAID MANY OF THEM ARE NOW DES 
PONDENT THEY FEAR THE TRICKLE OF 
RESULTS YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
IS JUST PRELUDE TO ROBERT MUGABE 
RIGGING THE FINAL RESULTS NEARLY 
THREE DAYS ON REMEMBER THAT THREE 
DAYS ON FROM THE CLOSE OF POLLS 
THERE IS NO REAL INDICATION OF WHO 
HAS WON THAT ALL IMPORTANT 
PRESIDENTIAL VOTE LET'S GO NOW TO 
OUR FIRST REPORT FROM PETER BILES 
AS THE ELECTION RESULTS CONTINUE 
TRICKLING OUT ZIMBABWENS ARE TRYING 
TO PICK UP EVERY NEW SNIPPET OF 
INFORMATION THE DELAY IS CAUSING 
FRUSTRATION 
LAST TIME THEY TAKE FRUSTRATION ONE DAY END OF MORNING WE RECEIVE 
ALL THE RESULTS 
I THINK IT'S GOING 
TO TAKE ABOUT THREE TO FOUR DAYS 
COMPARED TO LAST TIME WHEN WE VOTED 
LAST TIME TOOK ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
THE SLOW RELEASE OF THESE RESULTS 
IS FUELLING SUSPICION THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO BUY TIME 
AND RIG THE OUTCOME 
WE ARE VERY 
UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY THE RESULTS 
ANNOUNCEMENT IS TAKING PLACE WHAT 
HAS HAPPENED IS THAT MOST OF THE 
RESULTS FOR PARLIAMENT ARE ALREADY 
KNOWN WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT 
THE ZIMBABWE ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
IS TRYING TO MANAGE THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PARLIAMENTARY 
RESULT WE ARE CHALLENGING THEM TO 
RELEASE ALL THE FIGURES AS QUICKLY 
AS POSSIBLE TO DEFUSE WHAT EVER 
ANXIETY THAT MIGHT EXIST WITHIN THE 
ZIMBABWEN PEOPLE 
THE ZIMBABWE 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION HAD WARNED 
THIS PROCESS MIGHT TAKE SOMETIME 
BUT FOREIGN OBSERVERS TOO ARE NOW 
BEGINNING TO QUESTION WHAT IS 
HAPPENING 
THE DELAY OF THE RESULTS HAPPENING GIVES ROOM FOR PEOPLE TO BE VERY 
VERY SUSPICIOUS OF THE FINAL 
OUTCOME 
IN SPITE OF THE EMOTION OUTCOME GENERATED BY THESE ELECTIONS THERE 
IS NOT YET ANY ESCAPE FROM THE 
HARDSHIP OF DAILY LIFE THE QUEUES 
FOR MONEY AND AND FOOD REMAIN 
UNDER ROBERT MUGABE ZIMBABWE ONLY 
GETS WORSE 
AS WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THE B. B. C. IS 
BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE BUT THAT'S NOT 
STOPPED US FROM GETTING INFORMATION 
FROM INSIDE THE COUNTRY INDEED ONE 
OF OUR CORRESPONDENTS IAN PANEL HAS 
MANAGED TO GET IN WE ARE NOT GOING 
TO SAY WHERE HE IS DISCLOSE HIS 
LOCATION FOR OBVIOUS SAFETY REASONS 
BUT THIS MORNING HE SENT US A 
DESPATCH ON A COUNTRY THAT'S 
SWAMPED BY SUSPICION AND RUMOUR 
THERE IS AN AIR OF EXPECTANCY IN 
ZIMBABWE AS PEOPLE WAIT FOR YET 
ANOTHER DAY TO BE TOLD WHO THEIR 
NEXT PRESIDENT WILL BE THE STAKES 
COULDN'T BE HIGHER NORMALLY THERE 
IS ONLY ONE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION 
HERE THE DISASTROUS ECONOMY WHERE 
TO BUY BREAD OR MEAT WHICH PETROL 
STATION HAS FUEL HOW MANY MORE 
MILLIONS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO PRICES 
OVERNIGHT IN A COUNTRY WHOSE 
INFLATION RATE EXCEEDS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER CENT 
YOU ARE TOLD TERRIBLE STORIES OF 
DESPERATION INCLUDING FEMALE 
TEACHERS BEING FORCED INTO 
PROSTITUTION TO MAKE ENDS MEET 
THAT'S WHY THE ELECTION RESULTS 
HAVE NOW BECOME THE OTHER MAIN 
TOPIC OF CONVERSATION HERE PEOPLE 
HOPE THAT THE RESULTS WILL BRING 
SALVATION EVERYONE I HAVE SPOKEN 
TO HAS VOICED SUPPORT FOR THE 
OPPOSITION AND BELIEVES ITS 
CANDIDATE MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS 
WON BUT THE LONGER THE RESULTS ARE 
DELAYED THE MORE THEY WORRY THAT 
YET ANOTHER ELECTION WILL BE RIGGED 
AND THE HOPE FOR REAL CHANGE IN 
ZIMBABWE MAY ONCE AGAIN BE DASHED 
WELL THAT WAS AN AND PANEL FROM 
INSIDE THE COUNTRY OBVIOUSLY THE 
EVENTS THERE ARE BEING WATCHED 
THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND IN 
PARTICULAR HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WHAT 
HAPPENS THERE HAS THE POTENTIAL 
MAKE NO MISTAKE HAS THE POTENTIAL 
TO DESTABLISE WHAT UNTIL NOW HAS 
BEEN ONE OF THE MOST STABLE AND 
PROSPEROUS PARTS OF THIS CONTINENT 
GORDON BROWN HERE HAS BEEN CALLING 
FOR ZIMBABWE'S ELECTION RESULTS TO 
BE PUBLISHED IMMEDIATELY THAT'S 
BEEN COMING IN HERE TO US THAT'S 
SOMETHING THE OPPOSITION WANTS 
WHAT ARE THEY DOING AT THE MOMENT 
I THINK THE OPPOSITION FACE A VERY 
VERY DIFFICULT TIME A BIG 
CHALLENGE THEY CLAIM THAT THEY ARE 
THE VICTORS AND YET THEY'VE GOT TO 
WORK OUT WHAT TO DO TO PUSH THAT 
CLAIM FORWARD THE CONUNDRUM FOR 
THEM IS DO THEY MOBILISE THE PUBLIC 
WE HAVE HEARD THE PUBLIC IS IN NO 
MOOD TO GO OUT ON TO THE STREETS 
THEY'RE TOO SCARED TOO HUNGRY SO 
I THINK FOR MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND 
THE M. D. C. HE IS GOING TO WAIT A WHILE 
BUT WORK OUT EXACTLY AT WHAT TIME 
HE CAN RISK PUSHING THE PEOPLE OUT 
PERHAPS STARTING SOME KIND OF 
PROTEST MOVEMENT THAT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS 
I WOULD THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BE 
MOMENTOUS DAYS INDEED FOR THAT 
COUNTRY ZIMBABWE 
THANK YOU 
THE TWO ROYAL MARINES KILLED IN 
SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN HAVE BEEN 
NAMED LIEUTENANT JOHN THORNTON TWENTY THREE 
AND TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD MARINE DAVID MARSH 
BOTH FROM FORTY COMMANDO WERE ON 
PATROL NEAR KAJAKI IN HELMAND ON 
SUNDAY EVENING WHEN THEIR VEHICLE 
WAS CAUGHT IN A BLAST 
THE DEFENCE SECRETARY DES BROWNE IS 
TO ANNOUNCE THAT NO MORE TROOPS ARE 
TO BE WITHDRAWN FROM IRAQ FOR THE 
TIME BEING BECAUSE OF RECENT 
VIOLENCE IT HAD BEEN THOUGHT 
FOLLOWING A REVIEW MORE THAN HALF 
THE FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SOLDIERS LEFT IN THE 
COUNTRY WOULD BE RETURNING HOME 
OUR SECURITY CORRESPONDENT FRANK 
GARDNER IS HERE NOW THIS IS 
SOMETHING OF A CLIMBDOWN THEN A A LITTLE BIT YES IT'S A DECISION 
TAKEN WITH SOME RELUCTANCE I THINK 
ON ADVICE FROM COMMANDERS ON THE 
GROUND IN IRAQ IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
PERMANENT JOINT HEADQUARTERS AT 
NORTHWOOD THEY SIMPLY COULDN'T DO 
IT AT A TIME WHEN THE VIOLENCE IN 
BASRA HAS FLARED UP AND THE BOTTOM 
LINE IS BRITISH TROOPS ARE IN IRAQ 
TO MENTOR THE IRAQI ARMY TO 
GUARANTEE SECURITY AND CLEARLY THAT 
JOB ISN'T YET DONE BECAUSE AS WE 
HAVE SEEN OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED IN THE LAST WEEK OF OF 
FIGHTING THE IRAQI ARMED FORCES 
CAN'T DO THIS ON THEIR OWN H. F. E. A. 
OWN I THINK U. S. MILITARY COMMANDERS 
ARE SAYING WELL HANG ON THIS IS 
UNACCEPTABLE FOR BRITAIN TO START 
REDUCING ITS TROOPS THERE WHEN THE 
JOB IS NOT YET DONE ALL THE HOPES 
WERE THEY THEY COULD REDUCE THE 
NUMBER AND SHIPPING SOME OF THOSE 
NUMBERS TO AFGHANISTAN THEY CAN'T 
DO IT YET 
FOR THE TIME BEING THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH MUCH NOW NANNYING OR NECESSARY THE 
GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSING THAT 
EVERYONE IN ENGLAND OVER THE AGE OF 
FORTY AND UNDER THE AGE OF SEVENTY FOUR GETS 
SCREENED FOR HEART AND KIDNEY 
DISEASE DIABETES AND STROKE RISK 
IT CLAIMS SCREENING WOULD SAVE 
TWO THOUSAND LIVES A YEAR BUT THE BRITISH 
MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS WORRIED THAT 
IT COULD DIVERT CARE FROM PEOPLE 
WHO NEED IT MOST 
JANE HUGHES REPORTS 
AOEU LEAN MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN SHE 
WAS IN DANGER OF HEART DISEASE IF 
SHE HADN'T BEEN CALLED IN FOR 
SCREENING NOW HER CLINIC'S HELPING 
HER HER CHANGE HER DIET TO CUT THE 
RISK 
I DON'T HAVE 
SUGAR NOW AND RISK SUGAR IN DRINKS THAT'S ALL STOPPED 
FOR MY OWN BENEFIT PLENTY OF 
VEGETABLES 
SHE IS ONE 
OF HUNDREDS VEGETABLES OF PATIENTS ACROSS NOTTINGHAM WHO 
HAVE HAD LETTERS OFFERING THEM 
HEALTH CHECKS THE GOVERNMENT WANTS 
THE SAME THING OFFERED TO EVERYONE 
IN ENGLAND BETWEEN THE AGES OF FORTY 
AND SEVENTY FOUR THEY THINK SCREENING WORKS 
BEST FOR THAT AGE GROUP IN 
NOTTINGHAM THEY SAY THEY'RE ALREADY 
SEEING RESULTS 
WE HAVE PICKED UP A NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK AND FIVE 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIABETES AND 
SOMEONE WITH CHRONIC RENAL DISEASE 
THOSE ARE PEOPLE WE CAN THEN MANAGE 
APPROPRIATELY ADVISE AS TO HEALTH 
RISK FACTORS THE LIFESTYLE RISK 
FATTORS AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR 
THEM IN THEIR LIVES 
AT THE MOMENT THE G. P.'S IS THE PLACE 
YOU GO WHEN YOU ARE FEELING ILL 
BUT THIS WILL SHIFT THE EMPHASIS ON 
TO PREVENTING CONDITIONS WHICH 
AFFECT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THE COST 
IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
MILLION A YEAR BUT THE GOVERNMENT 
SAYS ULTIMATELY THE SAVINGS WILL BE 
FAR MORE THAN THAT 
THEY SAY IT COULD PREVENT UP TO 
NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES A 
YEAR FOUR THOUSAND CASES OF DIE BEELTS AND 
IT COULD SAVE TWO THOUSAND LIVES IN 
ENGLAND ENGLAND DIABETES BUT G. P.'S SAY IT'LL MEAN 
CALLING IN MILLIONS OF EXTRA 
PATIENTS PATIENTS THERE IS NOWHERE TO PUT THE EXTRA 
STAFF THAT WE'D NEED THERE IS NO 
MONEY TO PAY THE EXTRA STAFF AND 
IF THE PRESENT STAFF ARE THE ONES 
DOING THE WORK THEY WON'T BE ABLE 
TO DO THE AMOUNT THAT'S NECESSARY 
AND PROVIDE ACCESS FOR THOSE PEOPLE 
WHO ARE ILL WHO RIGHTLY SHOULD 
COME TOP OF THE QUEUE THE THE CONSERVATIVES SAY THIS IS AN OLD 
IDEA REANNOUNCED THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS QUESTION THE COST OF IT 
IN THE FACE OF OTHER CUTBACKS THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS HEALTH CHECKS WILL 
BEGIN LATER THIS YEAR 
OUR TOP STORY THIS LUNCH TIME A 
DAMNING REPORT ON IMMIGRATION A 
LORDS' COMMITTEE SAYS IT IS OF 
LITTLE OR NO ECONOMIC BENEFIT 
COMING UP WHY WHERE YOU LIVE COULD 
LAND 
YOU WITH 
A BIGGER BILL FOR 
YOUR PRESCRIPTION 
ON B. B. C. LONDON LONDONERS SPENDING 
HABITS BRING THE CAPITAL A STEP 
CLOSER TO BECOMING A FAIRTRADE CITY 
AND CARRYING A TORCH FOR THIRTY YEARS 
THE OLYMPIC RUNNERS WHO FINALLY 
TIED THE KNOT 
INQUEST INTO THE DEATH OF PRINCESS 
DIANA HAS SAID IT WAS BLINDINGLY 
OBVIOUS THAT THE EVIDENCE GIVEN BY 
HER FORMER BUTLER PAUL BURRELL WAS 
NOT THE WHOLE TRUTH YESTERDAY IN 
HIS SUMMING UP THE CORONER TOLD THE 
JURY THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO 
SUPPORT CONSPIRACY THEORIES THAT 
THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH ORDERED 
DIANA'S DEATH OR THAT IT WAS 
ORGANISED BY M. I SIX 
OUR ROYAL CORRESPONDENT IS AT THE 
HIGH COURT WHAT DID HE HAVE TO 
SAY 
PAUL BURRELL IS ONE OF THOSE SAY CHARACTERS WHO ALWAYS ATTRACTS A 
LOT OF HEADLINES BUT QUITE WHAT HIS 
REAL SIGNIFICANCE IS IN THE 
CONTEXT OF THESE INQUESTS THOSE 
ARE MATTERS THAT THE JURY WILL NOW 
HAVE TO DECIDE MR. BURRELL WAS HERE 
GIVING EVIDENCE EARLIER THIS YEAR 
HE WAS CERTAINLY GIVEN A HARD TIME 
BY COUNSEL PARTICULARLY COUNSEL 
FOR MOHAMED AL FAYED HE WAS SENT 
AWAY TO FIND DOCUMENTS TO TRY TO 
SUBSTANTIATE SOME OF HIS CLAIMS AND 
MR. BURRELL SAID THAT THE WHOLE 
EXPERIENCE WAS QUITE HORRID WELL 
NOW THIS MORNING THE CORONER HAS 
CERTAINLY LAID INTO HIM AS HE HAS 
CONTINUED HIS SUMMING UP LORD 
JUSTICE SCOTT BAKER SAID THIS 
THE CORONER SAID THAT DIDN'T 
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE JURY 
SHOULD DISREGARD ALL OF HIS 
EVIDENCE BUT HE SAID I ADVISE YOU 
TO PROCEED WITH CAUTIOUS 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE LEFT WITH THE 
IMPRESSION THAT HE ONLY TOLD YOU 
WHAT HE WANTED YOU TO HEAR HE SAID 
THAT ALL IN ALL YOU MAY THINK MR. 
BURRELL'S BEHAVIOUR HAD BEEN PRETTY 
SHABBY THEN SUMMARISING THE REST 
OF THE PERHAPS MORE SUBSTANTIVE 
EVIDENCE HE HAS DEALT WITH THE 
WHITE FIAT UNO HE SAID THERE WAS 
NO EVIDENCE THAT THAT DELIBERATELY 
CAUSED THE CRASH THEN HE HAS 
TURNED TO THE WHOLE AND VERY 
IMPORTANT QUESTION OF HENRI PAUL 
AND DRINK THE CORONER SAID THAT 
THERE IS DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT HE 
HAD CONSUMED TWO FIVE SENT LITRE 
MEASURES OF RICARD IN THE BAR THE 
EQUIVALENT OF FOUR SINGLE MEASURES 
OF WHISKEY HE ALSO SAID THAT WHAT 
IS CLEAR IS THAT STAFF AT THE RITZ 
KNEW THAT HENRI PAUL HAD BEEN 
DRINKING BEFORE HE DROVE THAT NIGHT 
AND HE SAID THAT THE JURY WOULD 
HAVE TO WEIGH UP WHETHER THE STAFF 
AT THE RITZ HOTEL HAD CLOSED RANKS 
IN EFFECT TO KEEP QUIET ABOUT THAT 
BRIEFLY WHAT TIMETABLE FOR THE 
INQUEST NOW 
SUMMING UP WILL 
CONTINUE UNTIL TOMORROW THERE'S 
BEEN A BIT OF A HICCUP AT THE 
MOMENT THE EARLIEST THE JURY WILL 
BE GOING OUT WILL BE TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON OR POSSIBLY THURSDAY SO 
VERDICTS PERHAPS THURSDAY OR 
FRIDAY FRIDAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE COST OF 
DUMPING RUBBISH IS GOING UP AND IT 
COULD SOON BE HIT IN YOUR POCKET 
FROM TODAY THE GOVERNMENT SIN 
CEASING THE TAX IT CHARGES COUNCILS 
FOR USING LANDFILL SITES TO TRY TO 
ENKUDGE MORE RECYCLING BUT THE 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION IS 
WARNING HOUSE COLDS TO SEE THEIR 
COUNCIL TAX BILL RISE BY FIFTEEN YEAR 
AS RESULT HOUSEHOLDS 
WITH ONLY SIX YEARS OF LANDFILL 
SPACE LEFT IN SUFFOLK THE COUNTY 
COUNCIL HERE HOPE MORE WILL FOLLOW 
KAREN CANNARD'S EXAMPLE FROM ABOUT 
BATTERIES PLASTICS AND FOOD SHE 
RECYCLES THE LOT 
EVERYBODY COULD 
DO IT REGARDLESS OF THE SITUATION 
EVEN IF YOU CAN'T GET TO ZERO WASTE 
WE CAN ALL MAKE THAT LITTLE BIT 
MORE EFFORT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT 
THROUGH REUSING WHAT WE HAVE AND 
RECYCLING 
AND FOR COUNCILS FROM TODAY EVERY 
LOAD TAKEN TO LANDFILL WILL COST 
THEM MORE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TO EIGHT THEY WERE 
CHARGED TWENTY FOUR PER TONNE THAT WILL 
RISE TO THIRTY TWO AN EIGHT INCREASE THAT 
WILL MEAN THAT COUNCIL ALSO SEE IN 
TOTAL LANDFILL TAX RISE OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION MILLION THE GOVERNMENT HAS PLEDGED TO 
RETURN SOME OF THE TAX GENERATED BY 
THIS STUFF BACK TO COUNCILS WHOSE 
LEADERS SAY THEY ARE OWED AROUND 
THREE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION WITHOUT IT THEY SAY 
COUNCIL TAX BILLS COULD HAVE TO 
RISE BY AROUND FIFTEEN 
OUR COUNCIL IS VERY CLEAR OUR 
POLITICIANS ARE VERY CLEAR THEY 
WANT IT KEEP THE COUNCIL TAX DOWN 
THAT'S WHAT THE ELECTORATE HAS TOLD 
THEM WE UNDERSTAND WHY THE 
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO STOP US LAND 
FILLING BECAUSE IT IS DANGEROUS TO 
THE ENVIRONMENT BUT WE NEED 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT SO YES TACTS 
LANDFILL BUT GIVE US THE MONEY BACK 
SO WE CAN RECYCLE AND COMPOST MORE 
SO YES TAX THE LANDFILL 
HOUSEHOLDERS WHO RECYCLE MORE MAY 
END UP PAYING MORE AS WELL 
WE ARE ON FIRE WE ARE ON FIRE 
THE LAST RADIO MESSAGE FROM AN R. A. F. 
HERCULES HAS BEEN PLAYED AT AN 
INQUEST INTO THE DEATHS OF THE TEN 
SERVICEMEN KILLED WHEN THEIR PLANE 
CRASHED INTO IRAQ THE HERCULES 
CAME DOWN AFTER FUEL TANK WAS HIT 
BY ENEMY FIRE AND THEN EXPLODED 
MATT PRODGER IS AT THE COURT NOW A 
DRAMATIC AND POIGNANT RECORDING 
HEARD IN COURT THERE TODAY THE THE INQUEST HEARD THAT THIS INQUEST 
THE TEN SERVICEMEN WHO DIED IN 
JANUARY TWO THOUSAND FIVE REPRESENTED THE 
BIGGEST SINGLE LOSS OF LIFE IN 
COMBAT SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
AND THEIR FAMILIES CAME HERE THIS 
MORNING BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KNOW 
WHY WHY THE BALL OF FLAME MARKS THE SPOT 
AN R. A. F. HERCULES DOWNED BY ENEMY 
GUNFIRE TO ONE OF ITS FUEL TANKS 
THE FINAL RADIO MESSAGE FROM THE 
AIRCRAFT WE ARE ON FIRE WE ARE 
ON FIRE 
TEN SERVICEMEN DIED IN THE ATTACK 
ON JANUARY TWO THOUSAND FIVE AS THE PLANE FLEW 
LOW BETWEEN BAGHDAD AND BALAD 
AIRBASE AIRBASE THIS INQUEST WILL ASK KEY QUESTIONS 
WOULD THE MEN HAVE SURVIVED IF 
PLANES OF THIS TYPE HAD BENEFITED 
WITH EXPLOSIVE SUPPRESSANT FOAM 
THEY SINCE HAVE BEEN AND WHY 
DIDN'T THE CREW KNOW ABOUT 
SIMILAR ATTACK ON U. S. HELICOPTERS IN 
THE SAME AREA IN THE SAME DAY THE 
CORONER WILL CALL ON SECRET 
WITNESSES THEIR IDENTITIES 
CONCEALED FOR SECURITY 
AND AFTER LENGTHY STRUGGLE WITH 
THE U. S. GOVERNMENT HE'S NOW 
OBTAINED CRUCIAL STATEMENTS FROM 
AMERICAN SERVICEMEN 
THIS MORNING THE INQUEST HEARD FROM 
ONE WITNESS WHO DESCRIBED THE 
HERCULES RACING ALONG AT BETWEEN 
THREE HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED METRES ABOVE THE 
GROUND BEFORE IT WAS CHASED BY 
STREAK OF FLAME AND EXPLODED 
AND THIS INQUEST BEGAN A FEW WEEKS 
AFTER THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE WENT 
TO THE HIGH COURT IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
LIMIT THE LANGUAGE OF CRITICISM 
WHICH INQUIRIES LIKE THESE CAN 
EMPLOY WHEN CRITICISING THE 
MINISTRY OF DEFENCE FOR APPARENT 
FAILINGS BUT THE CORONER HERE HAS 
PROMISED A FULL FRANK AND FEARLESS 
INQUIRY INQUIRY PASSENGERS AT HEATHROW'S TERMINAL FIVE 
ARE FACING MORE DISRUPTION WITH 
ANOTHER FIFTY SHORT HAUL FLIGHTS 
CANCELLED BRITISH AIRWAYS SAYS IT 
HOPES TO BEGIN RETURNING A BACKLOG 
OF NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND BAGS THAT HAVE 
BUILT UP SINCE THE NEW TERMINAL 
OPENED LAST WEEK BUT THE AIRLINE 
HAS WARNED IT WILL BE SLOW 
PROCESS FROM TODAY IF YOU LIVE IN 
ENGLAND AND ARE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY 
YOU CAN HOP ON BUS AND TRAVEL FOR 
FREE IN THEORY COULD YOU MAKE YOUR 
WAY FROM LAND'S END TO BERWICK UPON 
TWEED WITHOUT PAYING A PENY THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS PUT OVER TWO HUNDRED 
MILLION INTO THE SCHEME BUT SOME 
LOCAL COUNCILS SAY THE SUMS DON'T 
ADD UP 
FROM TODAY M. P.'S WILL BE ABLE TO 
RECORD THAT THEIR RELATIVES ARE 
WORKING FOR THEM ON THE REGISTER OF 
MEMBERS' INTERESTS THE SCHEME 
WHICH IS COMPULSORY FROM AUGUST 
FOLLOW ACCUSATION THAT IS SOMS M. P.'S 
MISUSED PUBLIC FUNDS THE RULES 
HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED AFTER DEREK 
CONWAY WAS THROWN OUT OF THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY FOR PAYING HIS 
SON FORTY THOUSAND FOR WORK HE DIDN'T 
CARRY OUT 
THE COST OF N. H. S. PRESCRIPTIONS IN 
SCOTLAND HAS BEEN CUT TO FIVE IT IS 
THE FIRST OF SEVERAL PRICE DROPS 
WITH THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT 
PROMISING TO ABOLISH ALL 
PRESCRIPTION CHARGES BY TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN 
ALMOST OH NINE PER CENT OF PRES ARE ALREADY 
DISPENSED FREE OF CHARGE 
FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCOTS THE 
COST OF MEDICINE IS PICKED UP BY 
THE N. H. S. BUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE WHO PAY WILL BENEFIT FROM 
THE REDUCED FIVE FEE CUT OF ONE POINT EIGHT FIVE 
THE SCOTTISH NATIONALISTS ANNOUNCED 
THE CUT AT COMMUNITY CHEMIST IN 
GOVAN TO COINCIDE WITH AN INCREASE 
IN CHARGES IN ENGLAND AND THEY SAY 
THEY ARE COMMITTED TO ABOLISHING 
CHARGES BY TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN 
THIS YEAR IS THE 
SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE N. H. S. L. L. 
THINK IT IS RIGHT THAT WE ARE 
TAKING THE STEP THAT WILL RETURN 
THE N. H. S. TO ITS FOUNDING PRINCIPLE 
HEALTH CARE FREE AT THE POINT OF 
USE 
THE REDUCTION NORTH OF THE USE BOREDER IS CONTRASTED BY A FIFTEEN P. RISE 
IN ENGLAND TAKING THE COST TO 
SEVEN POINT ONE OH PER PRESCRIPTION WHILE THE 
WELSH ASSEMBLY ABOLISHED THE FEES 
ENTIRELY LAST YEAR WITH NORTHERN 
IRELAND DUE TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT 
TOMORROW THERE ARE NOW BIG 
DIFFERENCES IN WHAT WE PAY FOR OUR 
PRESCRIPTIONS DEPENDING ON WHERE 
WE LIVE IN BRITAIN THE POLICY WILL 
COST NINETY SEVEN MILLION OVER THE NEXT 
THREE YEARS THE S. N. P. SAYS THAT'S 
MONEY WELL SPENT BUT IT NOW MEANS 
THAT ENGLAND IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE 
PLACE IN THE U. K. FROM WHICH TO 
OBTAIN YOUR PRESCRIPTION 
NOW IN THE PAST FEW MINUTES THE RED 
ARROWS HAVE MADE A SPECTACULAR FLY 
PAST OVER CENTRAL LONDON TO 
CELEBRATE NINETY YEARS OF SERVICE FROM 
THE ROYAL AIRFORCE NICK 
RAVENSCROFT HAS SPENT THE MORNING 
WITH THE PLANE'S CREW AS THEY 
PREPARED FOR THE FLIGHT OVER THE 
CAPITAL THESE RELICS WERE THE 
CUTTING EDGE OF AVIATION IN THEIR 
DAY NINETY YEARS AGO THE R. A. F. WAS 
FORMED AND ITS PILOTS THROUGH 
SORTEES IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS OF 
WORLD WAR ONE AS THE DECADES 
PASSED THE PLANES A BECAME MORE 
RECOGNISABLE AS FLIGHTING MACHINES 
IN WORLD WAR TWO AND THE COLD WAR 
RIGHT UP TO TODAY'S ADVANCED 
FIGHTER JETS ON ACTIVE SERVICE 
THE RED ARROWS SYNONYMOUS WITH 
PRECISION FLYING ARE LEADING THE 
ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS TODAY ALL ALL OF THE PILOTS IN MY SQUADRON HAVE 
SERVED ON PRISONAL DETACHMENT AND 
EXERCISES AS WELL AS SOME OF MY 
GROUND CREW AT THE MOMENT 
ENGINEERS AND SUPPORT STAFF ARE 
SERVING IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 
WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE THE RED ARROWS 
THEY GO BACK TO FRONTLINE 
OPERATIONAL DUTIES IT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT WE REMEMBER THAT THAT IS 
A JOB THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE NINETY 
YEARS WE 
AWFUL LOT IN 
THAT TIME YOU THINK OF THE FIRST 
KIND OF AIRCRAFT THAT WE FLEW THE 
S. E. FIVES AND ANYHOW YOU LOOK TO THE NEW 
GENERATION OF FIGHTERS THE TYPHOON 
AIRCRAFT THE LEAP FORWARD NO 
CAPABILITY HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL IN 
NINETY YEARS WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL BE 
GOING ON 
SETTING OUT FROM THEIR 
BASE NEAR LINCOLN THEY WILL FLY 
PAST R. A. F. BASES EN ROUTE WHERE LIKE 
FOR THE QUEEN'S GOLDEN JUBILEE 
THEY WILL TRAVEL UP THE THAMES BUT 
INSTEAD WITH CORE 
OF THE NEW 
GENERATION TYPHOON FIGHTERS THE 
BRIEFINGS HAVE BEEN DONE THE 
PLANES HAVE BEEN CHECKED OVER AND 
THE PILOTS READY TO GO SO AM I 
I THINK 
WE SET OUT FROM THE RED ARROWS HOME 
NEAR LINCOLN FLYING PAST R. A. F. BASES 
EN ROUTE TO THE CAPITAL THERE AT 
ONE ZERO ZERO P. M. A BIRTHDAY SALUTE IN THE 
SKIES ACROSS LONDON 
WELL HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE RAVE 
R. A. F. WE SALUTE YOU IT WAS A GOOD 
DAY FOR A FLY PAST QUITE POSSIBLY 
THE SUNNIEST DAY THIS WEEK 
THE SWIND WHAT YOU WILL NOTICE THE 
SKIES ARE BRIGHT RATHER THAN PURE 
BLUE WE SAID SOMEBODY TO LAST 
NIGHT'S RAIN 
NOT EVERYONE IS ENJOYING WONDERFUL 
WEATHER THE WINDS ARE STRONG AND 
SHOWERS FREQUENT THROUGH SCOTLAND 
GUSTS OF SIXTY HAPPENING THROUGH 
LOWLAND SCOTLAND THE SHOWERS ARE 
OBVIOUSLY PRETTY FREQUENT YOU HAVE 
TO BE IN ABERDEENSHIRE TO ENJOY THE 
BENEFIT OF SHELTER AND SUNSHINE 
OTHERWISE WELL IT IS NOT SO GOOD 
TEN AT BEST IN GLASGOW 
FAIRLY QUICKLY AS YOU COME SOUTH 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CUMBRIA 
THERE ARE FEW SHOWERS THERE IS A 
LOT MORE SUNSHINE AND ALTHOUGH IT 
IS BREEZY AND CHILLY IN THE BREEZE 
IF YOU GET A BIT OF SHELTER IT IS 
A STRONG APRIL SUN AND IT'LL FEEL 
PRETTY WARM AT FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN THAT SORT 
OF ORDER YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
HIGH FIFTIES IF YOU WANT IT IN 
FAHRENHEIT THERE IS NOT A LOT OF 
CLOUD IN THE SKY IN CORNWALL AND 
DEVON AND WALES THERE IS A NOTICAL 
WESTERLY BREEZE BRINGING VERY FEW 
SHOWERS THE SAME IS TRUE FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND MOST OF THE 
SHOWERS JUST TOPPING THE FAR NORTH 
SO THAT'S THE PICTURE TODAY THE 
SHOWERS WILL EVENTUALLY DIE DOWN IN 
SCOTLAND IT WILL ALMOST BE A DRY 
NIGHT IN FACT AS THE BREEZE DIES 
THE CLOUD INVADES THOSE TWO 
PROCESSES DON'T QUITE ALLOW FROST 
TO FORM SO IT WON'T BE A 
PARTICULARLY COLD NIGHT THE AIR 
COMING IN IS FAIRLY MOIST THERE 
WILL BE HILL MIST SEVEN OR EIGHT 
QUITE WARM TOO NOT A LOT OF RAIN 
BUT THE PRINCIPAL DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN TODAY AND TOMORROW WELL 
THERE MIGHT BE TWO A LITTLE LESS 
BREEZE AND A LOT MORE CLOUD SO YOU 
HAVE TO BE IN EASTERN SCOTLAND OR 
EASTERN ENGLAND TO ENJOY MOST OF 
THE SUNSHINE TOMORROW THERE MIGHT 
BE HOLES ELSEWHERE BUT THEY ARE BY 
NO MEANS GUARANTEED THE BREEZE IS 
MORE OR LESS A WESTERLY IF YOU ARE 
IN THE SHELTER THAT'S FINE YOU GET 
THE SUNSHINE IF YOU DON'T IT'LL 
STILL FEEL WARM AT FOURTEEN LIKEWISE FOR 
THURSDAY TEMPERATURES HAVEN'T 
DROPPED AT ALL DESPITE THE AMOUNT 
OF CLOUD THOUGH OF COURSE THE SUN 
MAKES YOU GET THE BEST BENEFIT FROM 
IT SO A PRETTY CLOUDY DAY ON 
THURSDAY TOO BUT LARGELY DRY AND 
FAIRLY MILD 
O. K. INTERESTING WEEK SUNNY TODAY
