PETER EBDON AND MARK KING WERE BOTH 
VERY SATISFIED WITH THEIR 
PERFORMANCES IN THE FIRST ROUND OF 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP PETER SQUEEZED 
IN A FINAL FRAME DECIDER 
AGAINST JAMIE COPE ONLY ONE OF 
KENT WILL FEEL HAPPY AFTER THEIR 
SECOND ROUND MATCH THIS PROGRAMME 
WILL FEATURE THE FIRST SESSION 
HE HAS HIT THAT VERY HARD A LITTLE 
BIT BAFFLED BY IT HIMSELF 
BOTH PLAYERS HAVE COME THROUGH 
REALLY HARD MATCHES IN THE PREVIOUS 
ROUND 
THEY HAVE NOT PLAYED EACH OTHER 
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
MARK KING HAS REALLY TOUGHENED UP 
HIS GAME IN THE LAST SEASON OR TWO 
HE CURRENTLY HAS AN EXCELLENT 
CHANCE OF GETTING BACK INTO THE TOP 
SIXTEEN KEN DOHERTY GOING OUT HAS MOVED 
HIM UP A LITTLE BIT 
THE GOOD RECOVERY HE DID NOT PLAY 
THE BLACK PARTICULARLY WELL A GREAT SHOT AND HE 
DESERVES TO 
BE 
ON SOMETHING 
I THINK HE TRIED TO PUSH THE RED 
COAT OF THE WAY BUT MISSED THE KISS 
OUT OF THE WAY 
THE BLACK IS CLEARLY BUT HAVING 
TO USE THE RED MAKES IT MORE 
DIFFICULT IT IS CLEARLY ON BUT 
HAVING TO USE THE REST MAKES IT 
DIFFICULT 
MARK KING CROWD IS ON EVERY SHOT 
ALMOST AS THOUGH HE IS SITTING ON A 
BAR STOOL CRUNCHES 
A HIGHLY PROMISING START TO THE 
MATCH FOR MARK KING HE LOOKED VERY 
GOOD IN THE SECOND SESSION AGAINST 
MARK SELBY WHO WAS SECOND 
FAVOURITE FOR THE TITLE BEFORE THE 
START OF THE TOURNAMENT 
HE HAS A GREAT RECORD AGAINST 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN ALMOST A FIFTY PER CENT 
RECORD AND ARE NOT MANY PLAYERS 
CAN BOAST THAT 
IT FLEW OFF THE CUSHION A LITTLE 
BED BUT THE LAST RED IS STILL ON 
AND LITTLE BIT 
THIS IS THE KEY SHOT AT THE KISS 
INTO THE RED THAT IS LOOSE THAT IS PERFECT THE FRAME IS NOW SAFE CAN HE MAKE ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
PETER HAS NOT DONE A LOT WRONG HERE 
HE BROKE OFF A LITTLE BIT SUSPECT 
A VERY ENCOURAGING START FOR MARK 
KING AND HE WINS THE FIRST FRAME OF 
THE MATCH 
THIS ONE HAS COME NEARLY OUT OF 
BAULK AS WELL SO MAYBE THE TABLE 
IS PLAYING A LITTLE BIT QUICKLY 
IF THE RED IS STRAIGHT HE IS FINE 
HE CAN PLAY THE STUN RUN 
BEAUTIFUL SHOT THAT IS THE PERFECT 
WAY OF PLAYING A STUN RUN THROUGH 
YOU ALMOST SEE THE WHITE STOCK AND 
THEN IT RELEASES 
HE CAN JUST DROP THIS IN FOR THE 
LOOSE RED THAT IS ALL RIGHT 
AGAIN NICELY PLAYED HE DID NOT 
TRY TO GO INTO THE PACK TOO HARD 
BECAUSE THE CUE BALL MIGHT HAVE 
DRIFTED AWAY FROM THE NEXT RED 
MARK KING LOOKED IN TOTAL CONTROL 
IN FRAME ONE AND THIS IS ALMOST 
EQUAL AT THE MOMENT PETER EBDON 
HAS NOT PLAYED A BAD SHOT HERE 
STILL A BIT OF WORK TO DO TO MAKE 
IT A FRAME WINNING BREAK HE HAS TO 
WORK OUT A PLAN TO GET ON A COLOUR 
NICELY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE 
REDS IN THE MIDDLE 
HE HAS A CHOICE OF PINK OR BLACK 
PINK TO LEFT CENTRE WOULD OBVIOUSLY 
GEARED TOWARDS THE REDS AND 
DEVELOPED A FEW 
IF HE SKEWS IF 
DEVELOPED A FEW IF HE SKEWS IF HE SCREWS IN TO DO THREE REDS TO 
THE LEFT OF THE PINK HE HAS EVERY 
CHANCE HERE 
THERE MUST BE A PLANT ON OTHERWISE 
HE WOULD HAVE PLAYED THE PINK 
RATHER THAN THE BLACK 
THE COLOURED MIGHT BE A PROBLEM 
THE COLOUR A GOOD STANDARD SO FAR 
THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND SHOT THAT 
MARK KING HAS HAD AFTER THE BREAK 
OFF SHOT AND SO IT IS GOOD STANDARD 
AND THAT IS AMAZING THE KISS ON 
THE BROWN HAS GIVEN HIM A CHANCE TO 
PINCH THE FRAME THIS GAME ALREADY 
COULD BE ALL ABOUT THE GREEN 
HE CAN POT THE BLACK BUT IT IS TOO 
THIN TO STAY FOR THE REDS SO HE 
WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO GO AROUND THE 
TABLE WHICH MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE GREEN IS 
OFF ITS SPOT SO HE CAN TRAVEL 
AROUND THE GREEN SPOT TO GET BACK 
WITHOUT THE KISS ON THE BLUE HE WAS 
NOT ON THE SHOT HE TOOK CHANCE 
I NEVER FEEL QUITE AS CONFIDENT 
WHEN PLAYERS PUT THE EXTENSION ON 
IF THEY ARE PLAYING STUN SHOT THERE IS MORE WEIGHT IN THE CUE 
STILL NOT PERFECT BUT HE HAS A 
CHANCE OF GETTING ON THESE THREE 
REDS 
HE PLAYED IT SLOWLY TO MISS THE 
KISS ON THE PINK 
THIS IS PROBABLY AS MUCH AS HE 
COULD HOLD THIS AND HE CAN PLAY ON 
THE PINK FROM THIS RED 
LOOKING IN ADVANCE THE GREEN IT 
FOR A LEFT HANDER IS NOT 
TOO BAD 
PERHAPS PETER SHOULD THINK ABOUT 
THAT BUT IT IS PUTTING A COLOUR 
SAFE HE SHOULD PUT THE YELLOW SAFE 
BECAUSE THEN THE LEFT HANDER HAS TO 
USE THE REST 
ANGLE NEEDED ON THE YELLOW TO BE 
ABLE TO GET ON THE GREEN 
I'M NOT SURE HOW HE GETS FROM 
YELLOW TO GREEN NOW PROBABLY THE 
WORST ANGLE YOU COULD IMAGINE 
THIS WOULD TAKE SOME SHOT TO PLAY 
ON THE GREEN THAT IS NOT A GOOD SHOT AT ALL 
THE FIRST BAD SHOT THAT HE HAS 
PLAYED MARK KING IS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE 
I THINK YOU WOULD NOT NORMALLY GO 
ONE CUSHION BUT IN THIS CASE 
OBVIOUSLY IT IS PROBABLY THE BEST 
ANGLE IF HE DOES MISS IT IT WILL 
NOT BE STACKED UP IT WILL GO BACK 
UNDER THE MISS RULE HE CAN AFFORD 
TO MISS THIS ONCE L. THINK IT IS THE ONLY WAY 
THAT WAS WELL PLAYED THE FACT THAT 
PETER EBDON LEADS BY NINETEEN HE MIGHT 
JUST PUT THE GREEN IN AND WORRY 
ABOUT MARK KING GETTING IN FOR A 
TIE 
THAT WAS NOT A GREAT SHOT FROM 
PETER 
HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING ELSE BUT THE 
POT WHY WOULD HE 
THE FACT HE DOES NEED TWO SNOOKER'S 
PETER EBDON WILL LEVEL AT ONE TO ONE 
THAT IS ANOTHER ONE A LITTLE BIT 
OF FUN BETWEEN THE PLAYERS PETER 
LOOKS UP AND SHRUGS HIS SHOULDERS 
MARK KING GIVES HIM MIRROR IMAGE 
THEY LOOK ALIKE AND OBEYED THOUGHT 
IT LIKE THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN 
DO IN THIS GAME AND THEY THOUGHT 
ALIKE THAT IS A MASSIVE FLUKE 
THERE IS PLENTY OF ADVANTAGE IN 
PLAYING THE DOUBLE PLAYERS DO NOT 
NORMALLY TWELVE HAVE WANT TO 
THE CUE BALL IS PLAYED AS A SHOT TO 
NOTHING THE YELLOW AND GREEN ARE 
IMPOSSIBLE EBDON IS STRONG 
FAVOURITE FOR TO ONE TWO TO ONE 
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD SHOT HE MAKE 
GET A FEW POINTS ON MISSES PETERED 
WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO PLAY IT IN 
SUCH WEIGHT TO LEAVE THE RED ON SO HE MAY PLAY IT SLOWLY PETER 
OH DEAR THAT GOES TO SHOW YOU 
WHAT YOU CAN DO THE CUE BALL CAME 
BACK IN THE WRONG DIRECTION HE 
REALLY SCREWED THAT HE TRIED TO 
CHANGE THE ANGLE COMPLETELY 
IF THE 
WHITE HAD FINISH WHERE IT WAS HE 
WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE BALLS 
REPLACED HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE 
LEFT THE YELLOW WHERE IT IS 
THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT A NATURAL 
ANGLE 
THAT WAS AN INTERESTING A THIRD 
THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN 
ELEMENT OF LUCK WITH THAT SHOT 
EFFORT 
I THINK HE TIS TOO EFFORT DIFFICULT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO 
CLEAR UP SO HE MIGHT AS WELL GET A 
BIT CLOSER ON THE SCORE BOARD HE 
MIGHT GET THIRTY POINTS ON THIS WHERE 
THE GREEN AND YELLOW ARE I WOULD 
BE RELUCTANT NOT TO PUT THEM IN 
AGAIN UNTIL HE HITS IT 
HE WENT WIDE DEATH THAT WAS A GOOD 
SHOT WHITE THERE THIS RED WILL 
CUT WHETHER HE CAN CUT IT IN AND 
COME OFF THE CUSHION AND MOVE THE 
YELLOW IT IS VERY THIN SO IT MAY 
NOT BE ON 
THAT IS THE KIND OF 
SHOCKED HE IS SPEAKING ABOUT 
SHOT 
IT WAS A BIT THIN I THINK IT WAS 
TOO THIN TO HAVE THE NATURAL ANGLE 
STILL ALL TO PLAY FOUGHT IN THE 
FRAME FOUR FOR 
THAT WAS WORTH THE RISK HE NEEDED 
THE YELLOW TO GO SAFE AND IT IS 
QUITE SAFE EBDON MIGHT DECIDE TO 
TAKE THIS ON 
IT IS FRAME BALL IT IS PROBABLY A GOOD THING THAT 
PETER DID NOT FLUKED THE YELLOW IT 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO MATCH FOR MARK 
KING TO TAKE IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS 
GOING IN FOR A WHILE 
HE ALMOST PUTS THE GREEN OUT THAT 
WAS NOT WHAT PETER WAS LOOKING FOR 
HE HAS LOOKED AT ANOTHER SNOOKER 
THERE WAS AN APOLOGY FROM PETER 
FOOT THE BALLS ARE NOT RUNNING 
VERY WELL FOR MARK HE HAS GOT 
EIGHT CHANCE OF WINNING IT BUT HE 
IS GOING TO HAVE TO HIT THIS 
SNOOKER BEFORE TRYING ANYTHING ELSE 
HE NEEDED A BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE AND 
HE HAS DESERVED IT IT IS MARK 
KING'S TURN TO HOLD HIS HAND UP 
THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM EBDON 
IT IS AMAZING HOW DIFFERENT PLAYERS 
FEEL WHEN THE BALL IS SAFE MARK 
KING IS TRYING TO MAKE THINGS 
HAPPEN HE WAS TRYING TO PLAY IT 
HARD TO GET IT CLOSER TO THE GREEN 
IT IS ANOTHER SHOT THAT PETER 
SHOULD TAKE BECAUSE IT IS FRAME 
BALL HE COULD POT THE YELLOW IN 
THE CORNER 
WHY IS HE SCREWING BACK WHY 
DOESN'T HE JUST POT THE YELLOW I I THOUGHT THE SAME THING L. DID NOT 
UNDERSTAND THE SHOT HE WOULD 
PROBABLY HAVE GOT IT THE WAY HE WAS 
CUEING IT HAS MADE THE POT MUCH 
MORE DIFFICULT 
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR 
PETER FOLSTAD HE WILL DEFINITELY BE 
TAKING THE POT ON PETER 
THAT WAS TOO THICK IS THIS THE 
CHANCE THAT MARK HAS BEEN WAITING 
FOR WILL HE PLAY THE SNOOKER 
BEHIND THE BLUE L. DO NOT THINK HE HAS THE ANGLE TO DO THAT 
HE PLAYED THE SNOOKER THAT IS A 
VERY GOOD SHOT 
HE COULD DO WITH 
PETER MISSING THIS IF HE DID THE 
DIFFERENCE WOULD BE TWENTY ONE BOTH 
PLAYERS WOULD NEED THE GREEN THAT 
WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT 
EBDON IS THE FAVOURITE BECAUSE HE 
ONLY NEEDS THE YELLOW 
HE IS ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS IN 
THE GAME WITH THAT LITTLE HOLDING 
SHOT MARK KING HE PLAYS THAT SHOT 
REALLY WELL 
I THINK IT WILL GO BACK HE IS 
CLOSE TO THE MIDDLE POCKET IF HE IS 
TO MAKE THE SHOT HAPPEN THIS IS 
THE SHOT IT LOOKED LIKE HE CAME 
CLOSE TO THE FIRST CUSHION HE 
SLIPPED A BIT WIDE MAYBE HE WILL 
PLAY A DIFFERENT SHOT 
WHAT A SHOT THAT WAS A BIT SPECIAL 
THAT WAS AN AMAZING SHOT HE 
PROBABLY FELT THE ANGLE WAS NOT ON 
BECAUSE OF THE MIDDLE POCKET 
THAT WAS A FABULOUS SHOT FROM PETER 
EBDON 
HE HAS NOT GOT THE HELP HE NEEDED 
THE FACT THEIR HE NOW NEEDS YELLOW 
AND GREEN HAS NOT MADE A LOT OF 
DIFFERENCE THAT IT IS THE SAME 
SCENARIO AS BEFORE CAN HE GET THE 
YELLOW OUT L. DO NOTHING HE HAS THE ANGLE TO DO IT NOT THINK 
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE GOT IN 
BEHIND THE GREEN 
THAT IS THE ONLY CONCERNED WITH 
THAT SHOT YOU THINK THE DOUBLES 
ARE SHOTS WHEN YOU CANNOT LEAVE 
ANYTHING ON BUT YOU CAN FLICK THE 
JAW IS THIS A HALF CHANCE FOR THE 
FRAME MARK KING MUST HAVE THOUGHT 
THAT COULD HAVE COST ME THE GAME 
FOR US OF THAT SHOT COULD HAVE WON 
HIM THE GAME HE FORCED GET INTO 
PLAY THE DOUBLE WHICH HAS GONE 
ASTRAY EBDON 
NOW THEN THAT WAS PLAYED VERY WELL 
IF HE IS STRAIGHT ON THE BROWN 
THAT IS NOT TERRIBLE HE CAN PLAY A 
SCREW SHOT HE HAS GOT THE POWER 
IT IS ALL ABOUT THE ANGLE MAYBE 
JUST SLIGHT ANGLE TOWARDS THE 
BAULK CUSHION IF HE PLAYS A RUN 
THROUGH 
HE PLAYED TOP OF THE BALL AND USE 
THE BAULK CUSHION HE PLAYED IT 
BIT FAR HE WOULD LIKE TO BE RIGHT 
IN BEHIND THE BLACK WITH NOT TOO 
MUCH TO DO 
I AM SURE HE PLAYED ON IT INTO THE 
CORNER IT IS ONE OF THOSE SHOTS 
IF YOU OVERHIT YOU REALLY WANT TO 
OVERHIT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET IN 
BEHIND THE BLACK 
I THINK IT IS 
WORTH A DOUBLE IF HE CAN PUT THE 
WHITE TIGHT ON THE CUSHION THERE 
WOULD BE MORE ADVANTAGE TO PLAYING 
THE DOUBLE HE COULD PLAY A CANNON 
INTO THE BLACK IF HE PLAYS BE CUT 
WHAT A SHOT HE MADE THE CUE BALL 
SLOWED DOWN SO MUCH 
THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT CLEARANCE 
JUST BE TWENTY FIVE POINTS BUT IT WAS 
ABSOLUTELY PRECIOUS PETER EBDON IS 
TWO FRAMES TO ONE 
A VERY RELIEVED 
MARK KING GETS FRAME FOUR UNDER WAY 
HE IS TWO TO ONE IN FRONT HE WILL BE 
DELIGHTED HE PLAYED VERY WELL IN 
THE LAST FRAME TO PINCH IT 
THAT IT WAS VERY SWEET CUEING FROM 
PETER L. HAVE WONDERED IF HE WILL 
FRANCE HE A GO AT THE BROWN IN THE 
CENTRE I WONDER IF HE WILL FANCY 
HAVING A GO 
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD IT WAS A 
TOUGH BROWN TO PLAY IF YOU ARE 
STRAIGHT ON THOSE THEY ARE EASY 
IF IT IS A THREE QUARTER BALL AND 
RUNNING THROUGH IT PUTS A LOT OF 
PRESSURE ON THAT SHOT 
TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO IN OUR DAY YOU WOULD 
NOT HAVE SEEN ANYONE GO FOR THOSE 
SHOTS 
IT WAS A TOUGH ONE TO PLAY SHOTS IT IS THE MODERN DAY GAME THERE 
ARE HOURS AND HOURS OF PRACTISING 
AT ALL SORTS OF SHOTS 
HE PLAYED IT BEAUTIFULLY HE PLAYED 
IT FOR CHOICE OF RED 
IT JUST WANTED ANOTHER TWO INCHES 
OF PACE AND HE COULD PLAY THE DEEP 
SCREW 
IF IT WERE ANOTHER TWO INCHES 
FURTHER DOWN HE COULD HAVE PLAYED 
THE SCREW SHOT INTO THE BUNCH HE 
HAS SOME WORK TO DO NOW 
THAT WAS MORE GOOD FORTUNE I HAVE 
SEEN ONE OR TWO KIDS MATCHES AND 
THE ART FLICK FROM PETER HE STILL 
TRAILS COULD NUDGE YEARS HE HAS 
NO CHOICE BUT TO PLAY THIS HE 
NEEDS TO DEVELOP HAS MANY REDS AS 
HE CAN 
IT IS ONE OF THOSE STRANGE 
SITUATIONS WHERE THE PLAYER WHO HAS 
HAD THE BEST RUN OF THE BALL IS NOT 
HAVING THE ADVANTAGE IT IS NOT 
ABOUT HOW MANY FLUKES SOMEONE HAS 
IT IS ABOUT WHO WINS THE MATCH HE 
DID NOT GOING TO BE PACK FULL BALL 
BECAUSE HE MIGHT HAVE PUSHED A RED 
INTO THE CORNER THAT IS WHY HE DID 
NOT PLAY THAT SHOT YOU WOULD HAVE 
EXPECTED SOMEONE OF THIS CLASS TO 
GO IN OFF 
HE HAS JUST LOST THE CUE BALL 
SLIGHTLY HE DID NOT POT THE RED 
THAT CLEANLY OVER THAT KIND OF 
DISTANCE THINK HE HAS GOT 
REASONABLE SHOT OF THE BLACK 
NUDGING INTO A FEW REDS 
WOW THAT LOOKED TO BEAT IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE POCKET BE 
IT WAS HIGH FROM THAT ANGLE IT 
LOOKED TOTALLY DIFFERENT HE STILL 
LOOKS BAFFLED HE HAS BLOCKED THE 
RED INTO THE SAME POCKET 
VERY RARELY DO YOU QUESTION PETER'S 
CHOICE OF SHOT BUT I QUESTION THAT 
ONE 
NOW PETER HAS PUT HIMSELF IN 
TROUBLE BECAUSE THAT COULD SAFETY 
SHOT HAS GIVEN HIMSELF ALL SORTS OF 
PROBLEMS HE CANNOT SEE THE RED 
STAND OF LEFT HAND SIDE D. REDS 
DOWN THE LEFT HAND SIDE 
COMPLETE MISJUDGEMENT I DO NOT 
THINK IT WAS THAT DIFFICULT A 
SAFETY SHOT HE CAUGHT IT TOO THIN 
AS LONG AS HE MISSES THAT RED HE 
CANNOT GO WRONG 
MARK KING WILL BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE 
THIS CHANCE TO MAKE IT THREE TO ONE 
THAT BAD SHOT THERE PULL HEARD FOR 
PETER EBDON AND LOSING THE PREVIOUS 
FRAME WILL HAVE HURT 
IT IS 
OBVIOUSLY A VERY LONG MATCH BUT 
JUDY STRAIGHT AT THE BEGINNING IN 
THE MIDDLE OR IN THE END IT IS ALL 
THE SAME BUT YOU'D LOSE FRAMES 
I THINK THIS IS THE BEST THAT I 
HAVE SEEN MARK KING PLAY LIVE ON 
TELEVISION IN A TOURNAMENT SUCH AS 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP YOU TRY TO 
BRING YOUR GAME AND MARK KING HAS BROUGHT THAT TO THIS TOURNAMENT 
THAT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT WE 
HAVE SEEN ONE OF THE REDS DISAPPEAR 
UNDER THE TABLE FROM THAT POCKET 
ONE SHOT AWAY THERE FROM HAVING A 
CHANCE TO WIN THE FRAME AT ONE 
VISIT 
WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING THAT SLOW THE 
BALL CAN MOVED FROM THE FINGERMARKS 
OFF THE BALL CAN MOVED FROM THE 
FINGERMARKS 
MARK IS HOPING THAT SOMETHING GOES 
WRONG HE HAS ONE ROAD WHICH WILL 
KEEP HIM INTERESTED AT THE BOTTOM 
OF THE TABLE ONE RET ONE OF RED 
TO KEEP HIM INTERESTED 
TOTALLY TO WRONG SHOT 
KEARNEY HAD 
TO POT THE RED HE ONLY HAD TO 
POT THE RED 
HE RETAINS THE ADVANTAGE WITH A 
DECENT SAFETY 
WE SAW MARK KING STILL POT LAST 
FRAME AND IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN 
WE SAW MARK KING STEAL THE LAST FOR 
HIM THE LAST FRAME 
HE HAS HAD A REPRIEVE PETER EBDON 
PLAYED ONE POOR SHOT AND IT HAS 
NOT COST HIM THE FRAME BARRING 
SPEAKERS IT IS PETER EBDON WHO HAS 
LEVELLED THE MATCH FOR THE SECOND 
TIME 
THAT WAS A WIDE IN CRICKET I'M NOT 
SURE WHAT HAPPENED THERE HE MISSED 
THAT BY A WIDE MARGIN L. DON'T KNOW 
WHERE IT CAME FROM BECAUSE 
OTHERWISE HE WAS CUEING WELL 
HE DEVELOPED THE PINK AND A COUPLE 
OF REDS AND HAS LANDED ON THE BLUE 
THAT HAS OPENED UP THE FRAME THE 
IDEA NOW IT IS TO GET ON THE PINK 
OR THE BLUE AND THE RED ON THE 
BLACK SPOT IS THE KEY TO TO FRAME 
NINE THE KEY TO THE FRAME NOW 
TOO RISKY TO SCREW INTO THE BUNCH 
HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GUARANTEED 
TO BE ON ONE SO HE WILL PLAY FOR 
THE LOOSE RED 
IF THE PINK SPOT IS COVERED THERE 
IS AN ADVANTAGE TO PLAYING FOR THE 
PINK NEXT AND HAVING THE PINK ON 
THE BLACK SPOT 
HE IS ON THE PINK BUT THERE IS NO 
WAY THAT HE PLAYED THAT CANNON ON 
THE RED 
HE HAS BEEN COMING HERE FOR MANY 
YEARS NOW AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU 
GET WHEN YOU WATCH PETER EBDON HE 
IS ONE OF THE MOST DETERMINED 
PLAYERS EVER A WONDERFUL GUY AWAY 
FROM THE TABLE HE LIVES IN DUBAI 
AND COMES TO SHEFFIELD A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT AND 
PLAYS AT THE ACADEMY HE IS A BIG RACE HORSE FAN 
A BIT STRAIGHT HERE WHICH IS NOT 
TOO BAD WHEN YOU HAVE A RED CLOSE 
TO THE PINK SPOT 
EITHER STRAIGHT 
OR THREE QUARTER BALL HE NEEDS TO 
BE ON THIS RED THE 
THIS FRAME AT THE MOMENT 
THE PINNACLE GO ON ITS OWN SPOT NOW 
SO THAT WILL MAKE THINGS SLIGHTLY 
MORE DIFFICULT THE PINK WILL GO 
THIS TABLE IS VERY FAST AND I AM 
NOT SURE WHETHER THE PLAYED FOR THE 
MIDDLE AND OVER RUN IT 
THAT WAS IT GREAT SHOT AND THE KEY 
TO IT IS NOT TO PUT ANY SIDE ON 
ONCE AGAIN IT SEEMS THAT ONE 
MISTAKE IS COSTING AT LEAST FOR 
FRAME 
PETER EBDON CAME INTO THIS MATCH AS 
FAVOURITE WHICH SETTING KISSED 
FAVOURITE ON PREVIOUS VISITS TO THE 
CRUCIBLE L. WAS DERRY IMPRESSED 
WITH MARK KING'S PERFORMANCE 
AGAINST MARK SELBY VERY IMPRESSED 
PETER EBDON IS FORTUNATE THAT JIMMY 
KO'D IS THE LESS EXPERIENCED PLAYER 
JAMIE COPE BECAUSE HE WAS THE 
BETTER PLAYER IN THE MATCH BUT 
PETER EBDON KNOWS HOW TO HANG IN 
AND WIN A MATCH 
AND HE NEEDS A GOOD SHOT TO KEEP 
THE BREAK GOING 
IT IS PETER EBDON'S HIGHEST BREAK 
OF THE MATCH SO FAR 
I DO NOT THINK THERE WAS A GAP 
THERE 
DID YOU SEE ANY DECENT SIGN THERE OF A GAP IT WAS NOT ON 
MARK IS 
LAUGHING BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE 
REFEREE IS GOING TO HAVE A JOB 
PUTTING THE BALLS BACK 
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE 
HE IS 
GIVING HIM THE TREATMENT HE IS 
HAVING LOOK AND THEN HAVING IT PUT BACK 
TIME TO TURN IT IN IF HE DOES NOT 
HAVE THE BALLS REPLACED 
HE JUST WANTED TO KEEP HIM WAITING 
AND THINKING AND THE REFEREE BIT 
OF TIME TO FORGET WHERE THE BALLS 
WERE PLACED 
HE HAS TO GET THE WHITE RIGHT HE 
CAN PLAY THE ONE CUSHION THE THE REFEREE OBVIOUSLY THINKS THAT MARK 
THINKS THAT THERE IS A GAP THERE 
BUT LOOKING AT THEM NOW YOU COULD 
NOT GET THEM MATCHSTICK THROUGH 
THERE 
YOU COULD NOT GET THE BALL THERE THROUGH THEIR LAST TIME I THINK 
THE REFEREE SHOULD AT LEAST LOOK TO 
SEE THAT THERE WAS SLIGHT GAP BEFORE 
I THINK IT IS A REALLY BEFORE TOUGH ONE TO PUT BACK 
PLAY ONE CUSHION MARK AND IT WILL 
SOLVE EVERYONE'S PROBLEM THE MISS 
RULE IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED BUT 
THIS IS WHERE TO GET A BIT FARCICAL 
WHERE ALL THE BALLS HAVE TO BE 
REPLACED 
THE ONE CUSHION REPLACED IS REPLACED RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT 
MAYBE HE IS WORRIED THAT IF HE'D 
RESTS ON IT IT COULD LEAVE A 
PROBLEM WHAT A BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE 
LOOKING AT CUSHION FIRST IF HE CAN 
GUARANTEE LEAVING THE WHITE WHERE 
THE RED IS THAT COULD BE A SNOOKER 
HE MUST HIT IT FULL BALL FOUND THAT FOUL 
MARK NEVER HIT THE RED AT ALL LIKE 
HE WANTED TO AND IN OFF HIS VERY 
UNFORTUNATE HE TRIED TO LEAVE THE 
WHITE WHERE THE RED WAS 
PETER EBDON IS BLESSED WITH 
WONDERFUL CONCENTRATION WE HAVE 
HAD FIFTEEN MINUTES OF SAFETY AND HE IS 
STILL ABLE TO MAKE A POT LIKE THAT 
EXCELLENT THE IF THE YELLOW WAS 
ON ITS SPOT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO 
EASY 
THAT PUTS HIM THIRTY IN FRONT OF HE 
DID NOT HAVE TO PLAY TOO MUCH 
HEROICS FRONT 
PETER EBDON LEFT THE YELLOW ON HE 
WILL BE COMFORTED BY THE FACT THAT 
MARK NEEDS A SNOOKER IN THE FRAME 
JUST ONE SNOOKER 
THERE HAS BEEN SOME DECENT SAFETY 
IN THIS FRAME THAT IS NOT A BAD 
KISS BALLS TO HE CAN GET THE WHITE 
IN BEHIND THE BROWN THE BROWN 
THE THAT THE KISS IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN EASY WITHOUT 
BANGS THE TABLE HE KNOWS IT WAS A 
CHANCE 
PETER WAS SHOWING MARK HOW TO GET 
THE SNOOKER HE KNOWS HIS WAY 
AROUND PETER EBDON 
THAT WAS AN 
EXCELLENT SNOOKER IT WAS TOUGH TO 
PLAY IT THAT WAY HE PLAYED IT 
PERFECTLY PERFECTLY FOUL 
THE LONGEST FRAME OF THE MATCH HAS 
GONE TO PETER EBDON HE LEADS BY 
FOUR THRANE TO THREE FRAMES 
JUST FOR THAT RECORD I THINK I HAD 
TEN HAIRS ON MY HEAD WHEN I MADE MY 
DEBUT L. WAS GOING TO SAY CAN ARE 
YOU MUST HAVE HAD HAIR ONCE THAT THAT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO WASN'T IT THAT WAS A GOOD OPENING RED 
THIS IS A CHANCE THE BLACK IS 
POTTABLE THE LAST FRAME WAS 
SCRAPPY EVERY FLEGG EVERY FRAME 
WAS DIFFERENT EVERYTHING IS 
DIFFERENT EVERY TIME YOU COME TO 
THE TABLE THE BALLS ARE ALWAYS IN 
A DIFFERENT POSITION 
THIS RED WILL BE HANDY TO GET OUT 
OF THE WAY FOR PETER IT WILL 
COMPLETELY CLEARED THE BLACK 
PLAYER CLEAR 
HE HAS DEVELOPED A COUPLE OF REDS 
IT WAS A KIP CHANCE I SUPPOSE 
HAVE TO DO IT OFTEN YOU SEE 
SOMEONE OPEN THE REDS UP QUELL 
PLAYING THE RED GOOD WHILE 
PLAYING THE RED 
HAVING COMMENTED ON EVERY FRAME IT 
WOULD BE PROBABLY THE BEST BET 
EBDON COULD HAVE GOT OUT OF THIS 
FROM WHAT WE ARE SEEING COME UP I 
WOULD THINK FOUR TO FOUR WAS THE RIGHT 
SCORELINE SEEING I WOULD THINK 
HE HAS LOOKED GOOD 
WHEN YOU PLAY 
PETER EBDON YOU KNOW YOU HAVE GOT 
TO SCRAP PARROTT THE FLAME THE 
FRAMES L. L. THINK WE MADE A BIT 
EARLIER WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT 
PETER'S CONCENTRATION GOODPOINT 
GOOD POINT A LITTLE SHAKE OF THE 
HEAD FROM PETER YOU DO NOT GET 
MUCH EMOTION FROM HIM NOTHING MUCH 
FROM PETER WHY DOES HE NOT LIKE 
THIS SHOT IT LOOKS A DECADE THE 
RED WILL POT 
O. K. THAT WAS FINE HE PLAYED IT 
IN SUCH A WAY BET HE GUIDED THE CUE 
BALL BACK THAT 
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE IS GETTING 
THROUGH THE BALL WELL HE PLAYED 
FOR THE TOP RED OF THOSE TWO IF HE 
DECIDES TO PLAY IT NOW HE CANNOT 
AVOID THE PACK 
HE GOT THE WHITE PERFECT BUT HE 
FORGOT THE POT IT IS REPRIEVE 
FOR MARK KING THE THIRTY FOUR POINT LEAD IS 
NOT ENOUGH 
MARK HAS NOT SEEN A LOT OF TABLE 
TIME RECENTLY L. WONDER IF HIS 
CONCENTRATION HAS GIVEN WAY YOU 
JUST FEEL BUT PETER IS STARTING TO 
GET THE UPPER HAND THAT 
PUT HIS 
FROM THOSE WHO FELT HE PUT HIS I I 
PR I 
PUBLIC 
PRIVATE LIFE BEFORE HI BEFORE HI DUTIES ON DU I DUOREIGN 
PRESIDENT DEFENDED SEND MORE TROOPS 
TO AFGHANISTAN 
SAYING IT WOULD BE WRONG D. 
THE 
TELLER THAN 
TAKEOVER HE 
REAFFIRMED 
TAKEOVER HE REAFFIRME REAFFIRME 
TAKEOVER HE REAFFIRMED HIS OPPOSITION OP I 
OPPOSITION TO TURKEY JOINING THE 
SAYING THAT HE 
HE'D TIMED THAT ONE NICELY YOU GET 
THE FEELING THAT PROBABLY HE WOULD 
SCORE ENOUGH TO WIN THE FRAME IT 
IS NOT REALLY AWKWARD HE HAS A 
GOOD CHANCE IT WOULD NOT 
NECESSARILY BE A REFLECTION OF ON 
THE SESSION IF PETER TICK A FIVE TO THREE 
LEAD L. THINK MARK KING LOOKED THE 
BETTER PLAYER IN THE BEGINNING OF 
THIS SESSION HE KNOWS AGAINST 
EBDON HE WILL NEED TO CONCENTRATE 
A LONG TIME THAT IS NOT EASY TO DO 
IT HAS GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR THE 
CUE BALL IS RUNNING AROUND THE BIT 
A BIT 
HE MISJUDGED THAT HE IS NOT 
INTERESTED IN THE BLACK HE IS 
PLAYING THE GREEN 
THAT WAS A NICE SHOT WHEN YOU SEE 
A PLAYER RELEASED RIGHT INTO THAT 
AND SWING THE CUE BALL ROUND HE 
DID NOT WANT TO DO THAT HE PLAYED 
IT QUITE SLOWLY HE JUST LOST THE 
EVE WHITE A LITTLE BIT 
I THINK THE 
PINK WILL POT IN THE MIDDLE LOST 
THE WHITE THIS IS NOT MORE THAN 
ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT THIRTY T. H. S. IN HIS FAVOUR SEVENTY 
HE HIT IT THICK BUT HE GOT THROUGH 
THE CUE BALL BEAUTIFULLY 
THAT WAS 
AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT SHOT HE 
PLAYED IT WITH TOP SPIN A LOT OF 
THINGS COULD GO WRONG HE HAS HIT 
IT BIG THAT WAS A BEAUTY THICK AND 
MARK KING IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO 
COME BACK TO THE TABLE IT HAS BEEN 
A LONG MATCH AND LOTS STILL TO PLAY 
FOR 
IT IS GOING TO BEAT PETER EBDON AT 
A THE OVERNIGHT LEAD GOING TO BE 
PETER EXTENT THAT TAKES THE 
OVERNIGHT LEAD EBDON THERE HAVE 
BEEN LOTS OF PREDICTIONS FOR THIS 
YEAR'S CHAMPIONSHIPS IT MIGHT BE 
AN OPEN YEAR WE HAVE NOT HAD TOO 
MANY PEOPLE FLAGGING UP THE CHANCES 
OF EBDON 
YOU KNOW THAT PETER EBDON IS 
PREPARED AND HE IS BOOKED IN FOR IT 
TO A HALF WEEKS HE HAS BEEN IN THE 
FINAL BEFORE TWO AND A HALF 
WEEKS 
YOU FEEL HE IS STARTING TO CUTE 
BETTER AND BETTER YOU COULD ARGUE 
THAT HE WAS LUCKY IN HIS FIRST 
MATCH CUE HE WAS ALWAYS BEHIND 
HE TOOK NINE REDS AND A NUMBER OF 
COLOURS IT WAS NOT ALWAYS HIGH 
COLOURS THE BLACK WAS NOT EASY TO 
GET ON AT THE START 
PETER EBDON WAS THREE TO TWO DOWN BUT HE HAS 
WON THE LAST TWO FRAMES IT IS 
PETER EBDON FIVE MARK KING THREE 
OVERNIGHT ADVANTAGE TO PETER EBDON 
BUT THERE IS EVERY CHANCE THIS 
MATCH COULD GO THE DISTANCE FOR 
COVERAGE OF DAYS SEVEN PRESSED BEAT 
RED BUTTON AT TEN A M. OTHERWISE ON 
B. B. C. TWO IT HIS A
