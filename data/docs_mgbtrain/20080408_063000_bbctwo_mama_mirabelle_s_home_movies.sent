WITH ALL THOSE STRIPES FLYING BY EVEN I CAN GET CONFUSED 
BUT HOW DID YOU FIND KARLA MAMA 
WELL THAT HERD OVER THERE 
IS A HERD OF GREVY'S ZEBRAS 
AND KARLA'S HERD IS A HERD OF PLAINS ZEBRAS 
YOU MEAN THERE'S MORE THAN ONE KIND OF ZEBRA 
THAT'S RIGHT THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT KINDS 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF OTHER ANIMALS TOO 
SOME OF THEM MIGHT SURPRISE YOU 
HOW DO YOU EVER TELL THEM ALL APART 
YOU HAVE TO SPOT THE THING THAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT 
BUT HOW DO YOU DO THAT 
WELL LET'S SAY IT PAYS TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK 
SO MAYBE IT WOULD HELP TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT A MOVIE OR TWO 
MOVIE TIME IT'S MOVIE TIME

FIREFLIES LIGHT IT UP 
THIS ONE IS CALLED A CLOSER LOOK 
CAMELS YES 
SO TELL ME HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR CAMELS 
WITH ONE HUMP 
OR TWO HA HA OH LOOK 
TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF CAMEL 
CAMELS WITH ONE HUMP ARE CALLED DROMEDARY CAMELS 
WHILE CAMELS WITH TWO HUMPS ARE CALLED BACTRIAN 
BOTH KINDS OF CAMELS USE THEIR HUMPS FOR THE SAME THING WHAT 
WELL CAMELS LIVE IN THE DESERT WHERE FOOD CAN BE SCARCE 
SO THEY STORE EXTRA IN THEIR HUMPS 
NOW THEN THIS IS AN AFRICAN ELEPHANT 
JUST LIKE ME AND ME 
BUT DID YOU KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER KIND OF ELEPHANT THERE IS 
YES SHOUT IT OUT IF YOU CAN SEE HOW THESE ANIMALS ARE DIFFERENT 
MEET SOME ASIAN ELEPHANTS 
HOW DO YOU TELL AFRICAN AND ASIAN ELEPHANTS APART MAMA 
LET'S ALL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK 
I'M NOT SURE I CAN TELL THEM APART 
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME 
O. K. KIDS HERE ARE TWO BIG CLUES 
WOW THEIR EARS ARE HUGE 
GIGANTIC MUCH BIGGER THAN THE ASIAN ELEPHANTS 
SO THAT'S HOW YOU CAN TELL THEM APART 
AFRICAN ELEPHANTS' EARS ARE BIGGER THAN ASIAN ELEPHANTS' EARS 
ARE YOU READY FOR SOMETHING HARDER YES 
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR 
HEY THAT'S MY AUNT ZELDA AND UNCLE ZIGGY 
PLAINS ZEBRAS JUST LIKE YOU 
OH AND THERE'S MY OLD FRIEND GARY HE'S A GREVY'S ZEBRA 
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT I DON'T KNOW 
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK 
NOW YOU'RE GETTING IT 
SO DO YOU SEE ANYTHING DIFFERENT THOSE ZEBRAS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME 
AH DON'T BE SO SURE BO THEY BOTH LOOK VERY STRIPY 
KEEP LOOKING THEY'RE BOTH STRIPY 
BUT DO YOU SEE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE STRIPES I KNOW 
I KNOW YOU KNOW KARLA BUT LET THE OTHERS TRY 
LOOK AT THE ZEBRAS' TUMMIES BOYS THEIR TUMMIES H. M. M. 
OH I GET IT THE STRIPES THEY GO ALL THE WAY ROUND THE TUMMY 
THAT'S RIGHT ON THE PLAINS ZEBRA LIKE THIS ONE 
THE STRIPES GO ALL THE WAY ROUND ZELDA'S TUMMY 
BUT MY OLD FRIEND GARY HAS A WHITE TUMMY 
THOSE ARE A FEW OF THE ANIMALS THAT MIGHT SEEM THE SAME AT FIRST 
BUT WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK THEY'RE AS DIFFERENT AS CAN BE 
I KNOW HOW TO SPOT THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE TYPES OF ZEBRA AND ELEPHANT EVEN CAMELS 
BUT WHAT IF BOTH ZEBRAS ARE THE SAME KIND HOW DO YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE SAME KIND OF ZEBRA OR THE SAME KIND OF ELEPHANT 
WELL YOU KNOW 
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND IT CAN BE TRICKY 
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW I TELL THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN OUR FRIENDS THE MONKEY BROTHERS 
RIGHT ON CUE 
TELL ME WHICH IS WHICH 
OH I REMEMBER KIP IS THE ONE WITH THE SPIKY HAIR 
YES 
AND FLIP IS THE ONE WITH THE BUSHY HAIR 
SO THE LAST CHEEKY MONKEY WITH THE FLATTER HAIR MUST BE CHIP 
NOW YOU'RE GETTING IT LET'S PICK OUT A FEW MORE 
IT'S THE ASIAN ELEPHANTS 
THEY HAVE SMALLER EARS THAN AFRICAN ELEPHANTS 
WHAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER 
LET'S LOOK CLOSELY 
ONE HAS THOSE BIG WHITE THINGS STICKING OUT OF HIS MOUTH 
AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T BULL'S EYE BO 
THOSE BIG WHITE THINGS ARE CALLED TUSKS 
NAZ DOESN'T HAVE TUSKS BUT BILLY DOES 
I LIKE THIS GAME SHOW US MORE MAMA 
TWO BIGHORN SHEEP BUT I WONDER HOW THEY'RE DIFFERENT 
ME ME THAT ONE'S GOT BIGGER HORNS 
GOT IT IN ONE MAXIE 
THEY ARE DROMEDARY CAMELS THEY HAVE THE ONE HUMP 
AND THAT ONE HAS A LIGHT BROWN COAT THAT ONE'S DARKER 
THE LONGER AND CLOSER YOU LOOK THE MORE DIFFERENCES YOU SEE 
BO CAN YOU TELL WHICH ZEBRA IS WHICH IN MY HERD NOW 
I'LL DO MY BEST KARLA 
TAKE A GOOD CLOSE LOOK 
EVERY ZEBRA'S STRIPES ARE DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER ZEBRA'S STRIPES 
NO TWO STRIPED PATTERNS ARE EVER THE SAME 
YOU'RE RIGHT HE'S GOT THINNER STRIPES THAN THE ONE BEHIND HIM 
WELL DONE BO 
WHAT MAKES MINNIE DIFFERENT 
SHE'S GOT A BROWN SPOT ABOVE HER NOSE AW LOOK 
YES SHE CERTAINLY HAS 
EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY SEEM THE SAME FROM A DISTANCE 
WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK YOU REALLY CAN SEE A DIFFERENCE 
SO BO SHOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE PICKING YOU OUT OF A HERD KARLA 
NOW WHERE DID THAT LITTLE ZEBRA GET TO 
SHE WAS HERE JUST NOW COME QUICK 
COME ON THE SHOW'S ABOUT TO START 
O. K. I THINK I KNOW WHICH ONE FLIP IS
