SO I THOUGHT MOVING TO A NEW TOWN WOULD BE MY CHANCE 
MY CHANCE TO BE NORMAL BUT I WAS FORGETTING ONE LITTLE THING 
I'M A VAMPIRE 
I'M SURE WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A LEFT BACK THERE 
STOP BREATHING IN MY FACE YOU CAN'T HAVE BRUSHED YOUR TEETH FOR WEEKS 
AM I THE ONLY ONE GAGGING HERE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVE TO SPEAK THIS STUPID LANGUAGE 
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE WHY DID WE HAVE TO MOVE ANYWAY 
PLEASE BE QUIET I'M TRYING TO READ THE MAP 
DON'T TELL ME TO BE QUIET INSECT BITER 
RIGHT THAT IS IT OH 
DON'T YOU TOUCH ME YOU FUNGUS BRAT CREEP WITCH 
PUS FACE TURN RIGHT 
CORN CHEWER CRETIN FREAK 
FART BREATH SPIDER LICKER SCAB PICKER 
SNOT EATER RENFIELD 
WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON 
SORRY FOR DISTURBING YOU MASTER 
SILENCE INGRID WANTS RENFIELD TO TURN THE HEARSE AROUND AND GO BACK TO TRANSYLVANIA 
OH YOU DO AND WHAT ABOUT THE ANGRY TORCH WIELDING TRANSYLVANIAN PEASANT MOB

ROBIN 
ROBIN 
ROBIN FACE IT MAM YOU DID A GOOD JOB WITH ME AND PAUL 
AND ME THREE OUT OF FOUR AIN'T BAD IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT YOU ALSO HAD A GOTH CHILD 
HE HASN'T COME OUT OF HIS ROOM ALL MORNING AND THAT'S A BAD THING 
IF HE DOESN'T COME OUT NO ONE'S GOING CAMPING 
O. I. NUT JOB OPEN UP 
O. I. HURRY UP 
CAN I PROCEED NOW MASTER YES YES GOOD IT SMELLS LIKE A ZOMBIE'S ARMPIT IN HERE 
I THOUGHT SO IT'S VLAD'S STUPID STUFFED DOG 
O. I. HE'S NOT A DOG HE'S A WOLF 
AND HE DOESN'T SMELL 
WELL ACTUALLY MASTER VLAD I DO SMELL A BIT 
MY SAWDUST SEEMS TO HAVE GOT A LITTLE DAMP IN TRANSIT 
RENFIELD DRIVE 
WHAT IS THAT 
HOME SWEET HOME 
MAYBE DAD SHOULD GO ON A DIET 
I HEARD THAT 
WELL HERE WE ARE AT LAST H. M. M. 
IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING 
WHERE ARE THE COBWEBS THE DAMP THE ROTTING CORPSES 
LOOK DAD YOU JUST SAID FIND A CASTLE 
IT WAS THE BEST I COULD FIND AT SHORT NOTICE 
WELL SUPPOSE I MIGHT FEEL BETTER WHEN I'VE HAD SOMEONE TO EAT 
RIGHT I'LL GET MY THINGS 
BAGSIE THE TOWER ROOM I'M THE ELDEST I'M HAVING THAT ONE 
BUT I CALLED IT WHEN IN THE HEARSE RIGHT 
PLEASE THIS IS VERY SIMPLE 
VLADIMIR WILL HAVE THE ROOM 
BRILLIANT OH INGRID I DO BELIEVE YOU WERE ABOUT TO CHEW ON THAT 
THIS IS BECAUSE HE'S YOUR FAVOURITE ISN'T IT YES THAT'S RIGHT 
I HATE YOU MORE THAN GARLIC 
SHE IS SO MUCH LIKE HER MOTHER 
UGH IN THE ATTIC

THANKS DAD 
OH VLADIMIR THERE'S NO NEED TO THANK ME

IT'S ONLY RIGHT YOU SHOULD HAVE THE BEST ROOM 
ACTUALLY I ONLY WANTED THE TOWER ROOM COS I THOUGHT I MIGHT GET A T. V. 
AND THE RECEPTION'S BETTER UP THERE GRRR RRR 
TIME TO MEET THE NEIGHBOURS 
NOT JUICY ENOUGH GO AWAY 
A T. V. A T. V. 
IF YOU WANT TO SEE MOVING PICTURES VLADIMIR RUN AROUND THE PORTRAIT GALLERY 
DOES HE THINK HE'S LIVING IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY OF COURSE NOT MASTER 
THE COUNT THINKS HE'S LIVING IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
HE'S A FEW HUNDRED YEARS BEHIND EVERYONE ELSE 
I HATE BEING A VAMPIRE IT SUCKS ISN'T THAT RATHER THE POINT 
I JUST HOPED THIS MOVE WOULD BE A NEW START FOR US 
A CHANCE TO BE A BIT LESS 
VAMPIRIC EXACTLY COME ON TAKE A LOOK AT THIS 
SEE 
SEMI DETACHED HOUSES STREET LIGHTS A NEWSAGENT A GOLF COURSE 
IT'S ALL SO NORMAL 
RIGHT NEW LIFE NEW NEIGHBOURHOOD 
TIME TO CHECK 'EM BOTH OUT 
BUT YOUR FATHER HAS FORBIDDEN US FROM LEAVING THE CASTLE 
WE NEED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE 
ZOLTAN I'M A PRE TEEN VAMPIRE THAT MEANS I'VE GOT THE REFLEXES OF A NIGHT HUNTER 
COMBINED WITH AN INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO SNEAK OUT BEHIND MY PARENTS' BACK 
INGRID HOW'S THE GRAND SULK GOING I'VE DECIDED I'M GOING TO GO AND LIVE WITH MUM 
INGRID YOUR MOTHER'S DEAD 
YOU'RE DEAD WE'RE ALL DEAD YOU STILL CAN'T GO AND LIVE WITH HER 
YOU'RE JUST MAD BECAUSE SHE LEFT YOU FOR A WEREWOLF SHE DID NOT LEAVE ME FOR A WEREWOLF 
WE MUTUALLY AGREED TO SEPARATE AFTER SHE MET A WEREWOLF VLADIMIR KEEPS THE ROOM 
IT'S HIS BIRTHRIGHT AND WHAT'S MY BIRTHRIGHT 
I DON'T KNOW CLEANING MY CAPES HOUSEWORK SOMETHING LIKE THAT I HAVEN'T GIVEN IT MUCH THOUGHT 
I HOPE YOU GET SOME PAINFUL SPLINTERS FROM YOUR COFFIN 
RENFIELD MY STOMACH TELLS ME IT'S LUNCHTIME
