THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN NORWAY A PROPER WINTER COUNTRY 
AND WE HAVE PROPER WINTER SPORTS LINED UP FOR YOU 
SO WELCOME TO THE TOP GEAR WINTER OLYMPICS 
IT'S THE WINTER OLYMPICS SPEEDED UP A BIT 
WE'LL BEGIN WITH THE BIATHLON 
NORMALLY THIS IS A COMBINATION OF SKIING AND SHOOTING 
BUT SINCE THIS IS TOP GEAR WE'LL BE DRIVING AND SHOOTING 
LET'S START BY MEETING THE CONTESTANTS 
I SHALL BE USING THIS THE NEW AUDI Q. SEVEN 
AUDI'S FIRST ATTEMPT TO MAKE A SCHOOL RUN FOUR BY FOUR 
YOU SEE THE Q. SEVEN IS BASED LOOSELY ON THE PORSCHE CAYENNE BUT WITH THE HARDCORE OFF ROAD STUFF TAKEN OUT 
SO IT'S A BIT LIKE HAVING YOUR BIG SNOW BOOTS MADE BY THAT JIMMY SHOES BLOKE 
IT'S A FULL THREE INCHES LONGER THAN A LAND ROVER DISCOVERY 
AND IT'S THREE PER CENT UGLIER THAN A TROLL 
BUT THERE ARE SOME GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT 
IT HAS A VERY GOOD V. SIX THREE LITRE DIESEL ENGINE 
AN EXCELLENT GEARBOX AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT HAS SEVEN SEATS 
AND THE PRICE FOR THIS THREE LITRE DIESEL S. E. 
JUST UNDER FORTY THOUSAND 
VERY GOOD THE SECOND SORT OF SEMI OFF ROADER FOR FAMILIES 
BUT WHAT'S THE POINT OF BEING SECOND 
THAT'S LIKE DRIVING AROUND IN BUZZ ALDRIN I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE NEIL ARMSTRONG 
SO HERE IS THE CAR I'LL BE USING AS I BID FOR OLYMPIC GOLD 
IT'S THE VOLVO X. C. NINETY 
THIS WAS THE FIRST SEVEN SEAT FOUR BY FOUR DESIGNED BY SOMEONE WHO HAD CHILDREN 
NOT BY AN ENGINEER WHO READ ABOUT THEM IN A BOOK 
IT'S A BRILLIANT CAR IT REALLY IS 
IT'S NOT MUMSY IT'S NOT GITTISH 
IT'S LIKE THE FAMILY PET IT'S LIKE HAVING A FAITHFUL OLD LABRADOR 
THERE'S MORE TOO IT'S GOT A SMOOTH NEW DIESEL ENGINE 
IT'S MORE SPACIOUS THAN THE AUDI AND IT'S FOUR THOUSAND CHEAPER 
SO WHICH IS BEST 
THE LABRADOR OR BUZZ ALDRIN 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT IN OUR BIATHLON 
THE RULES ARE SIMPLE DRIVE THREE K. M. AROUND THE COURSE STOP SHOOT AT FIVE TARGETS 
AND THERE'S A FIVE SECOND TIME PENALTY FOR EVERY MISS THEN WE DO ANOTHER THREE K. M. 
COME BACK HERE SHOOT AT THE TARGETS AGAIN LYING DOWN IN THE BACK OF THE CARS 
THEN A SPRINT TO THE FINISH 
THE WINNER THAT'LL BE ME GETS GOLD 
AND THE LOSER GETS TO EAT SOME GOLDEN SNOW 
COME ON 
JAMES GRABBED AN EARLY LEAD IN HIS MORE POWERFUL AUDI 
WHOA WOO 
AND IN MY ENTHUSIASM TO CATCH HIM UP 
TREES OH 
I LOVE THE WINTER OLYMPICS 
HE WOULD BECAUSE CAPTAIN SLOW WAS NOW WELL AHEAD 
I DON'T WANT TO EAT GOLDEN SNOW 
NOW IT'S BUMPY 
BIATHLETES NEED TO EAT SIX THOUSAND CALORIES A DAY 
SIX THOUSAND THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO POUNDS OF BUTTER 
SEVENTY SLICES OF BREAD ONE HUNDRED TWELVE EGGS EIGHTY SIX TUBS OF YOGHURT 
TWENTY EIGHT POTATOES ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN BISCUITS AND TWENTY ONE TWIX BARS 
ON THAT BASIS I COULD BE AN OLYMPIC BIATHLETE 
THANKS TO MY OFF JAMES HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE SHOOTING RANGES 
MAGAZINE IN 
YOUR REAL BIATHLETE ARRIVES HERE WITH HIS HEART DOING ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY A MINUTE 
AND HE HAS TO TIME THIS WITH HIS HEART BEAT AND HIS BREATHING 
SHOOTING RANGE 
FIVE OUT OF FIVE TO BEAT VOLVO MAN 
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HIS SCORE 
NOT ONLY IS HE USING THE WRONG CAR HE'S USING THE WRONG GUN 
ZERO POINT TWO TWO'S ALL RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE NINE BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN A HURRY YOU NEED ONE OF THESE 
HECKLER AND KOCH M. P. FIVE MACHINE PISTOL 
FULLY AUTOMATIC 
EAT LEAD OLYMPIC TARGET 
OH YEAH 
STAGGERINGLY I MISSED THE LOT 
SO THAT WAS A FIVE SECOND PENALTY FOR EACH ONE 
TWENTY FIVE SECONDS IS A WEEK 
THAT'S THE SIDEWAYS BEND 
I'M ABOUT A MINUTE BEHIND CAPTAIN SLOW THERE'S A LOT OF TIME TO BE MADE UP POWER 
DIESEL IS EXCELLENT FOR OFF ROADING AS WHEN WE TURN IN REALLY TIGHT 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THAT WHEN THE GULF STREAM STOPS BRITAIN WILL LOOK LIKE THIS BRING IT ON 
WITH CLARKSON NOWHERE IN SIGHT I ARRIVE BACK AT THE RIFLE RANGE 
THIS TIME WE HAD TO FIRE LYING DOWN FROM INSIDE THE CAR 
WHICH MEANT DROPPING THE REAR SEATS 
IN THE Q. SEVEN IT WAS A DODDLE 
THAT'S IT 
TAKE COVER 
COME ON 
OH COCK I'VE MISSED A COUPLE YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD 
STOP BEEPING YOUR HORN 
DID YOU MISS ANY YES GOOD HE HAS PENALTIES THEN 
RIGHT SEATS DOWN 
NOW THE GOOD THING IS I ACTUALLY HAVE ONE OF THESE CARS AT HOME 
HOW DOES THAT GO DOWN 
THAT'S NOT IT 
I'M STUCK 
HOW CAN I NOT KNOW I'LL HAVE TO PHONE MY WIFE 
HI DARLING NO I'VE PULLED THE HANDLE 
THERE'S A WHAT O. K. THANKS 
AH HA COME ON IT'S FLAT ENOUGH 
LOWER THAT THERE WE GO 
THE GREAT THING WITH JEREMY'S SHOOTING IS YOU'RE SAFE AS LONG AS YOU STAND IN FRONT OF THE TARGET 
I'D LEARNED MY LESSON AND I WASN'T GOING TO MISS THIS TIME 
SO WITH JAMES THUNDERING ALONG I WAS BACK IN THE PENALTY BOX 
STEVIE WONDER COULD HAVE DONE BETTER 
THAT'S EXCELLENT 
BUT THEN JAMES STOPPED THUNDERING AND STARTED CRASHING 
GOD 
JAMES IS OFF 
JAMES IS OFF YES I MEAN 
OH NO OH POOR JAMES 
NEVER HAS A VOLVO BEEN DRIVEN LIKE THIS BEFORE 
THAT'S HIM THAT'S JAMES 
COME ON I CAN CATCH HIM SOD OFF CLARKSON 
WE ARE NECK AND NECK AS WE COME INTO THE FINISH 
NO HE'S GETTING AHEAD 
HE'S ON THE OUTSIDE THIS IS LOOKING GOOD 
THAT'S A MISTAKE 
COME ON UNDER STEER HE'S COMING THROUGH 
COME ON COME ON 
YES NO NO 
YES YES I'VE WON A TOP GEAR EVENT YES 
SO THAT'S ONE TO ZERO TO CAPTAIN SLOW DESPITE WHAT WE BOTH THOUGHT WAS RATHER A POOR CAR 
NOT ONLY IS IT UGLY 
BUT THE AIR SUSPENSION IS TOO COMPLICATED AND THE SEAT LAYOUT IS ALL WRONG 
STILL IT DIDN'T CHANGE THE OUTCOME 
YOU ARE KIDDING 
IT'S YOUR RULES 
I WISHED I HADN'T USED THE MACHINE GUN 
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING OF 
ANYWAY YOU'VE PROBABLY NOTICED THAT RICHARD HAMMOND ISN'T WITH US TODAY 
THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S ON COMMERCIAL DAYTIME TELEVISION 
YES HE'S ON LIVE EVERY AFTERNOON FILLING PAUL O'GRADY'S SLOT 
I JUST REALISED WHAT I SAID THERE 
ANYWAY BEFORE HE STARTED ENTERTAINING THE UNEMPLOYED AND ELDERLY 
WE GAVE HIM A TASTE OF WHAT LIFE WOULD BE LIKE OUT HERE 
YES IN NUNEATON ACTUALLY 
THIS IS THE MOTOR INDUSTRY RESEARCH ASSOCIATION 
HERE CARS ARE TESTED TO DESTRUCTION 
AND IN THIS CHAMBER THEY CAN RECREATE THE FREEZING TEMPERATURES OF THE NORTH POLE 
IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE FOR A TOP GEAR EXPERIMENT 
NAMELY WHO BREAKS FIRST IN EXTREME COLD CAR OR MAN 
THE CAR WE'VE CHOSEN IS A CITROEN C. ONE 
ONE OF THE MOST BASIC VEHICLES YOU CAN BUY 
AND THE MAN IT'S GOING UP AGAINST IS ALSO PRETTY BASIC 
MAINE 
OH GOOD 
ACCORDING TO A TOP FROSTBITE BOFFIN 
THE EXPERIENCE WOULD NOT BE PLEASANT 
MINUS THIRTY YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE 
ICE CRYSTALS START TO FORM IN THE TISSUE OF YOUR SKIN 
PUNCTURED CELLS FINGERS ARE GOING TO SWELL 
ANYTHING ELSE THAT GETS FROSTBITTEN PARTICULARLY YOUR MANHOOD MIGHT SWELL OR BLISTER 
EVENTUALLY IT WILL PROBABLY DROP OFF DROP OFF DROP OFF 
IN ORDER TO PROTECT ME AND MY MANHOOD 
I WAS COVERED IN TEMPERATURE SENSORS 
TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE THERE HAS TO BE A THERMOMETER IN ME 
AND THIS DOESN'T GO IN MY MOUTH 
THE CAR GOT SLIGHTLY MORE DIGNIFIED TREATMENT 
AND FINALLY WITH ME JUST WEARING A SCARF AND A WOOLLY PULLY 
WE WERE BOTH READY FOR THE BIG FREEZE 
THEY'RE A BIT WORRIED MY NOSE MIGHT DROP OFF 
SO THEY HAVE TO MONITOR THE TEMPERATURE 
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT 
THE TEMPERATURE WAS A MERE MINUS THREE SO THE EVIL BOFFINS ACTIVATED AN EIGHTY M. P. H. ARCTIC WIND 
THE BATTLE IS HEATING UP NO IT'S COOLING DOWN WELL IT'S 
I TRIED THE IGNITION EVERYTHING WORKS 
SO FAR I'D SAY WE'RE EVEN 
WE'RE HANGING ON IN THERE 
THE C. ONE COMES WITH A LITTLE SOCKET AND YOU CAN PLUG IN YOUR I. POD 
THE OFFICE KINDLY PROVIDED ME WITH ONE 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT 
OH LAY OH LAY OH LAY OH LAY FEELING HOT HOT HOT 
I'D BEEN IN THE WIND TUNNEL FOR OVER AN HOUR NOW 
AND IT WAS ALMOST MINUS TWENTY THREE IN THE CAR 
IN THE ENGINE BAY IT WAS CLOSER TO A MUCH TOASTIER MINUS SEVENTEEN DEGREES 
SO SURELY THE ENGINE WOULD START 
BATTERY WORKS 
COME ON 
I'M GIVING YOU YOUR BEST CHANCE 
BUT THERE WAS NO PULSE 
YOU ARE OUT 
SO I'D ALREADY BEATEN THE ENGINE 
THE REASON WAS I WAS RUNNING ON BLOOD BUT THE CAR WAS RUNNING ON DIESEL 
THIS IS A LITTLE BEAKER OF DIESEL 
AND LOOK IT'S GONE GLOOPY AND SOLID 
BUT THE CONTEST WASN'T OVER THIS WAS A BATTLE TO THE FINISH 
AND THE C. ONE'S ELECTRICS WERE STILL GOING 
HOWEVER THE BOFFINS WERE STARTING TO WORRY ABOUT MY FALLING SKIN TEMPERATURE 
HOW'S YOUR NOSE AND YOUR TACKLE STILL INTACT PRESUMABLY 
IT'S MINUS TWENTY SIX IN HERE NOW 
I WONDER IF THE CAR BATTERY STILL WORKS GIVE IT A SHOT YEAH 
HANG ON THE GEARBOX OIL IT'S ALL FROZEN UP 
I'LL TRY THE I. POD 
SUMMER OF SIXTY NINE BY BRYAN ADAMS 
THE EVIL BOFFINS REACTIVATED THE ARCTIC WIND 
AND THE TEMPERATURE PLUMMETED TO MINUS FORTY DEGREES CENTIGRADE 
AMAZINGLY THE ELECTRICS STILL WORKED JUST 
I WAS NOW IN THE FROSTBITE ZONE AND CLOSE TO CRACKING 
MY BRAIN WAS SO FUDDLED 
TODAY LIGHT PAPER 
BOOT 
WHAT 
THE BOFFINS WERE GOING TO HAVE TO PULL ME OUT BUT WOULD THE CAR CRACK FIRST 
HERE WE GO 
OH 
IT'S 
I'VE HAD IT 
NOBODY CAN DENY IT HUNG ON IN THERE IT NEVER CLAIMED TO BE A POLAR EXPEDITION VEHICLE 
IT'S A TINY LITTLE CHEAP SUPER MINI 
IT DID INCREDIBLY WELL BUT IN THE END I WAS BETTER 
SO THERE YOU ARE 
IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE TO THE NORTH POLE BUY A HAMMOND 
THAT WAS AMAZING INCREDIBLE 
DID YOU SEE HOW MANY CLOTHES HE WAS WEARING MUST HAVE BEEN FREEZING 
EITHER THAT OR HE WAS A BIG GIRL'S BLOUSE 
YEAH ANYWAY TIME FOR OUR NEXT EVENT 
THIS IS SPEED SKATING 
WHICH IN THE PROPER OLYMPICS INVOLVES MEN IN CONDOMS SLITHERING ABOUT 
IN A RACE THEIR HEARTS BEAT TWO HUNDRED TIMES A MINUTE 
AND IT'S ALL JOLLY EXCITING 
BUT WE THINK WE CAN DO BETTER 
THIS IS OUR ICE SKATES 
THE BRAND NEW JAGUAR X. K. EIGHT 
AND THIS IS TORVILLE 
WHAT THE OLDER FATTER TORVILLE IS GOING TO BE DOING IS RACING THIS FELLOW 
THAT IS ESKIL ERVIK AND HE IS THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER FOR THE ONE FIVE HUNDRED M. SKATING QUICKLY THING 
RIGHT IT'S A ONE FIVE HUNDRED M. RACE 
THREE LAPS 
AND THEY'RE OFF 
WELL HE IS ANYWAY 
THAT DIDN'T GO WELL 
NOW OH THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY THERE'S NO GRIP AT ALL HERE 
NO BREAKING AND NO REAL STEERING 
BIT OF A SLIP FROM TORVILLE THERE HERE COMES MAY HE'S GAINING ON YOU 
THE SKATER WAS HITTING FORTY M. P. H. THROUGH THE BENDS 
JEREMY WAS BARELY TOUCHING FOUR 
I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO MAKE IT AS AN OLYMPIC SPORT 
YOU COULD SLOW DOWN A RUDDY FUNERAL AT THIS RATE I'M GOING AS FAST 
THIS IS SO IRRITATING HAVING A MAN KEEPING UP WITH ME 
HE'S JUST GONE PAST ME AGAIN 
HE'S JUST TOYING WITH ME NOW 
NO 
I SUSPECT IT WAS MY DRIVING 
THAT LED THE JAG DOWN THERE 
BECAUSE ON THE FACE OF IT THIS DOES SEEM TO BE QUITE A CAR 
OBVIOUSLY 
ON SNOWY ROADS LIKE THESE I CAN'T POSSIBLY DO A PROPER ROAD TEST 
SO WE'LL DO THAT BACK IN BRITAIN 
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT I CAN TELL YOU NOW 
FOR INSTANCE IT'S FASTER AND HAS TWO MORE SEATS THAN THE NEW BABY ASTON 
BUT IT COSTS FIFTEEN THOUSAND LESS 
SURE THE ASTON'S A BEAUTIFUL LOOKING CAR 
BUT THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU'D CALL A MINGER IS IT 
IT WAS DESIGNED BY THE SAME MAN 
WHO DID THE ASTON 
AND IF YOU THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL ON THE OUTSIDE 
WAIT TILL YOU SEE THE INTERIOR 
OLD JAGS WERE ALL FULL OF WOOD AND PIPE TOBACCO 
IT WAS LIKE BEING INSIDE JAMES MAY 
IT REALLY IS A STAR SHIP IN HERE 
AND IT GOES LIKE ONE TOO 
WELL IT IS VERY QUICK 
OR IT WOULD BE IF I HAD A BIT MORE SPACE TO PLAY WITH 
YOU COULD HAVE SO MUCH FUN HERE 
FOLLOWED BY SUCH AN ENORMOUS ACCIDENT 
SO BECAUSE IT WAS GOING DARK WHICH IT DOES 
EVERY FIFTEEN SECONDS IN NORWAY 
I WENT TO MEET JAMES AT THE HOTEL 
TO MAKE A PLAN FOR THE NEXT TOP GEAR WINTER OLYMPIC EVENT 
YOU KNOW THAT JAG YOU KNOW IT WASN'T VERY GOOD AT SPEED SKATING 
NO WELL I WAS WONDERING 
HOW WOULD IT BE AT LIKE OFF ROAD SLALOM 
SPEED DANCE SKATING 
I'VE NO IDEA BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING 
I JUST THOUGHT OF IT GET A GREAT BIG OPEN AREA 
A FROZEN LAKE PERFECT 
THEN CARVE A SORT OF COURSE IN IT 
AND THEN YOU DRIVE ROUND IT BUT THEN YOU WANT A FOUR WHEEL DRIVE CAR 
NO YOU DON'T YES YOU DO THE LAKE DOESN'T FREEZE 
LIKE THAT IT FREEZES LEVEL 
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH HILLS 
FOUR WHEEL DRIVE WILL GIVE YOU CONTROL IN SLIPPERY CORNERS 
THAT'S WHY RALLY CARS ARE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE YOU'LL NEED FOUR WHEEL DRIVE 
YOU WON'T YOU WILL YOU WON'T 
IN THE MORNING AFTER A MILLION MORE BEERS I'M GOING TO PROVE IT TO YOU 
FINE YOU JUST WAIT WE'VE GOT A LONG TIME TO WAIT TILL MORNING 
SOMETIME THE NEXT AFTERNOON IT WAS MORNING 
AND WE FOUND THE PERFECT FROZEN LAKE 
JAMES ALSO FOUND HIS PERFECT CAR 
THE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE LAND ROVER DISCOVERY 
RIGHT I'M GOING TO BUILD A TRACK 
AND THIS IS WHAT I'VE GOT IN MIND 
IT'S GOING TO START WITH A LONG SWEEPING CURVE WHERE JEREMY WILL GET CARRIED AWAY AND APPLY THE POWER 
AND THEN IT'LL COME TO A STRAIGHT 
WITH A SERIES OF TIGHTENING S.'S WHERE JEREMY WILL CRASH 
THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER SWEEPING CURVE 
AND ANOTHER SERIES OF TIGHTENING S.'S 
AND THEN FINALLY IT'LL COME BACK AND JOIN THE BIG CURVE AGAIN 
BUT WHAT JAMES HADN'T REALISED 
WAS THAT THE ICE MIGHT NOT BE THICK ENOUGH FOR HIS BIG LAND ROVER 
AT THIS POINT IT IS 
THAT THICK YES 
DO PEOPLE FALL THROUGH THE ICE IN NORWAY ON LAKES YES 
OFTEN TWO LAST WEEK TWO LAST WEEK YES 
AND ARE THEY DEAD QUITE DEAD 
AND JAMES WOULD BE COMPETING IN A CAR THAT WEIGHS NEARLY THREE TONS 
WHEREAS MY JAG WAS SITTING AS YOU CAN SEE FROM ITS SATELLITE NAVIGATION SCREEN 
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE 
NO PROBLEM AT ALL 
BECAUSE IT'S MADE FROM ALUMINIUM 
AND THEREFORE WEIGHS ABOUT THREE OUNCES 
UNAWARE OF THE PROBLEM BOB THE BUILDER 
WAS BUSY WITH A TRACTOR CARVING OUT A COURSE 
IT'S CUTTING DOWN ONTO THE FIVE FOOT THICK ICE 
AND WHILE HE DID THAT I WENT FOR A SNEAKY PRACTICE 
IN MY TWO WHEEL DRIVE JAG 
OH NO 
I'M ALARMINGLY OUT OF CONTROL HERE 
HERE'S MR. MAY 
YOU KNOW IN REAL ICE SKATING 
PEOPLE SORT OF DO THIS YEAH 
AND THAT YEAH AND THIS 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHAT 
THAT 
FINALLY OUR OFF ROAD SPEED DANCE MEN'S WOMEN'S NO HILL 
TWO WHEEL DRIVE CHALLENGE SLALOM 
WAS READY 
GOOD TRACK JAMES NOT BAD IS IT 
ARE YOU READY YEAH I'LL HAVE A GO 
HOW THICK'S THE ICE YOU'LL BE FINE SERIOUSLY YEAH 
AND WE'RE OFF 
NICE BIT OF DRIFT THERE FLICK IT THE OTHER WAY 
THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO GET THE POWER DOWN ONTO THE ICE 
WITH FOUR WHEEL DRIVE INTELLIGENT DIFFERENTIALS 
INTELLIGENT TRACTION CONTROL NOT JUST BOOTING IT AND SHOUTING 
YOU JUST DON'T NEED FOUR WHEEL DRIVE OUT HERE 
OH YES 
THOUGHT I HEARD THE ICE CRACK 
I'M RECKONING ON JEREMY NOT BEING ABLE TO FACE THE CORRECT DIRECTION 
HE'LL GO ROUND AND ROUND IN CIRCLES 
OH WHAT A DRIFT 
VERY SAFE VERY STEADY 
AND IT TOOK HIM TWO MINUTES THREE SECONDS 
PATHETIC RUBBISH MAN YOU WERE HARDLY MOVING 
I WAS GOING AT A GOOD CONSISTENT SPEED AND IN CONTROL 
WHICH IS THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE YOU WERE BARELY MOVING 
THE OTHER DISAPPOINTMENT IS THAT YOU DIDN'T FALL THROUGH THE ICE 
DO YOU KNOW HOW THICK IT IS FOUR FEET 
ABOUT FIVE INCHES 
YOU'RE KIDDING NO ABOUT FIVE INCHES 
SO HOW WOULD THE REAR WHEEL DRIVE JAG GET ON 
OH YEAH WITH ALL THIS SPACE 
IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER AND FASTER 
THAN IT HAD BEEN ON THE ICE RINK OR ON THE ROAD 
SIDEWAYS IN CONTROL LOOKING GOOD 
POWER OH NO 
THAT'S A PIROUETTE 
NICE DANCING CIRCLES 
THIS IS RUBBISH 
WORK A BIT HARDER DON'T BE LAZY 
GET IN NOSE IN 
GIVE IT SOME FRONT END GRIP NOW 
IT'S GOOD 
IT'S BAD 
I WANT ONE OF THESE CARS 
NO ONE OF THESE LAKES 
THE FINAL BIG SWEEPING CORNER 
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ELEGANT SOMETHING PRETTY 
JAMES VERY GOOD I WON 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU WON I WON 
I WENT ROUND THERE IN TWO MINUTES THREE SECONDS YOU WERE THIRTY SECONDS BEHIND WHEN YOU CRASHED 
ICE DANCING IS NOT AGAINST THE CLOCK 
IT'S ABOUT POISE AND DELICACY AND BEAUTY AND I WAS MUCH MORE 
BEAUTIFUL THAN YOU WERE 
YES BUT THIS IS AGAINST THE CLOCK AND IT PROVES THAT FOUR WHEEL DRIVE BEATS TWO WHEEL DRIVE 
THAT WAS MY VICTORY 
IT'S GOING DARK SO WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO ARGUE 
BEFORE HE BECAME MIRED IN A WORLD OF AMUSING SHAPED VEGETABLES 
RICHARD HAMMOND CAME TO NORWAY WITH JAMES FOR A RACE 
YES AND WE THOUGHT WE'D SHOW IT TO YOU AGAIN NOW 
GO AND GET YOUR DISCOVERY BECAUSE I NEED TO PULL THIS OUT 
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING FIRST 
SINCE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT RICHARD 
YOUR CAR'S HAD ITS TEETH WHITENED 
LILLEHAMMER HAS ONE OF THE MOST FORMIDABLE BOBSLEIGH RUNS IN THE WORLD 
THE DOWNHILL COURSE OF TWISTS AND TURNS STRETCHES FOR ALMOST TWO KILOMETRES 
EVEN SO A CRACK BOBSLEIGH TEAM 
CAN GET DOWN THIS RUN IN JUST UNDER A MINUTE 
WITH THE BOBSLEIGH ITSELF HITTING EIGHTY MILES AN HOUR 
THAT SPEED COMES AT A PRICE FOR THE PASSENGERS EACH MEMBER OF THE TEAM 
IS SUBJECTED TO CORNERING FORCES OF FIVE G. THAT'S MORE THAN AN F. ONE DRIVER SUFFERS 
HONESTLY TO DO THIS YOU'D HAVE TO BE BRAVE STUPID OR JUST DESPERATE TO GET ON THE TELEVISION 
SO THIS IS WHERE I'LL BE SITTING HERE IN THE MIDDLE 
TO MAKE THINGS EVEN MORE ARDUOUS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RACE 
WE'VE COME TO LILLEHAMMER BECAUSE ALONGSIDE THE BOBSLEIGH RUN 
WE HAVE THIS ROAD THEY START IN THE SAME PLACE RUN DOWN THE HILL AND THEY FINISH IN THE SAME PLACE 
THE ROAD IS ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME LENGTH AS THE BOB RUN 
AND LIKE THE BOB RUN IT'S SLIPPERY AND FULL OF DIFFICULT CORNERS 
IT REQUIRES A SPECIAL VEHICLE 
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT IT'S A MITSUBISHI EVO WORLD RALLY CAR 
WITH A THREE HUNDRED HORSEPOWER TURBO CHARGED ENGINE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE 
AND STUDDED TYRES 
SO THAT'S THE CHALLENGE CAN THE RALLY CAR BEAT THE BOBSLEIGH 
I HAPPEN TO THINK IT CAN ALTHOUGH HAMMOND TELLS ME IT DEFINITELY CAN'T 
THIS IS MY BOBSLEIGH RUN 
IT WIGGLES ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE AND FINISHES THERE 
AND THIS IS THE ROAD 
WHICH WIGGLES ALL THE WAY UP THERE 
BUT IT FINISHES IN THE SAME PLACE 
BUT MY BOBSLEIGH CAN GET FROM THERE TO THERE IN LESS THAN A MINUTE 
YOU'VE HAD IT BUT ALL YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE YOU THERE IS GRAVITY 
I'VE GOT THREE HUNDRED HORSEPOWER 
AND A HUGE TURBO CHARGER 
AND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SPIKES IN EACH TYRE 
AND GRAVITY TO GET DOWN THERE 
YES BUT MY BOBSLEIGH WAS CUSTOM BUILT FOR GOING ON ICE 
YOUR CAR HAS HAD TO BE ADAPTED 
YOU'RE WEARING TIGHTS I AM I CAN'T TAKE LECTURES ON PHYSICS FROM A MAN IN TIGHTS 
DANCING YES PHYSICS NO 
THE TRUTH IS THOUGH THE BOB WILL BE HARD TO BEAT 
WHICH COUNTS ME OUT FOR DRIVING THE CAR 
SO INSTEAD WE'VE GOT HENNING SOLBERG 
THE NORWEGIAN NATIONAL RALLY CHAMPION 
THE BOBSLEIGH'S CHANCE OF VICTORY DEPENDS ON HOW GOOD OUR START IS 
THAT MEANS INTENSE PREPARATION FOR ME AND THE NORWEGIAN OLYMPIC BOBSLEIGH TEAM 
AND WHILE WE PRACTICE RUNNING 
THE DRIVER VISUALISES THE COURSE IN HIS HEAD 
ALL OF THIS PROVIDED MUCH MERRIMENT 
FOR THE BONE IDLE MAY ARE YOU WARMING UP YES 
I'M WARMING UP AS WELL 
TO BE HONEST I COULDN'T SEE THE FUNNY SIDE OF IT 
BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED ABOUT LETTING THE TEAM DOWN 
ANY TIME YOU LOSE HERE A SECOND 
IS MULTIPLIED BY THREE AT THE BOTTOM SO THAT'D BE THREE SECONDS 
AND I WAS ALSO WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER MY BODY WOULD COPE 
THE KEY THING IS AS YOU GO INTO THE CORNERS TO HOLD YOUR BREATH 
TO GET AS MUCH BREATH IN AS YOU CAN BECAUSE THAT SUPPORTS YOU WHEN YOU'RE BEING SUBJECTED TO G. FORCES 
APPARENTLY IN A COUPLE OF PLACES DOWN THERE IT HITS SIX G. 
THE DRIVER TOLD ME HE'S BEEN DOING THIS SIX YEARS 
AND HE'S THREE CENTIMETRES SHORTER 
I CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THREE C. M. 
JAMES WAS STRAPPED IN AND I WAS READY TO RUN 
OUR RALLY DRIVER COULD HARDLY SPEAK ANY ENGLISH 
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP JAMES GIVING HIM A PATRONISING PEP TALK 
RIGHTO HENNING IT'S THE REPUTATION OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION 
RESTING ON YOUR SHOULDERS 
IN THE NEXT MINUTE OR SO 
I WAS GOING TO TIME THE CAR WITH MY TRUSTY STOPWATCH 
AND HAMMOND'S BOB WOULD BE TIMED BY THE COURSE OFFICIALS 
THIS WAS IT 
MIND THE TREES YOU NUTTER 
WE'VE STARTED THE TURN 
THAT'S A TURN 
SIXTEEN CORNERS 
THAT'S THREE OF THEM DONE 
TWO KILOMETRES ON ICE IN A MINUTE 
BOY HAS HENNING GOT IT ALL TO DO 
OH THAT HURTS A LOT 
THE BOB MAY HAVE STARTED SLOW BUT IT WAS JUST GETTING FASTER AND FASTER 
THESE GUYS NEVER USE THE BRAKES 
NO NO 
THERE'S A CORNER COMING UP THAT'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER 
AT MIDPOINT ONE THOUSAND METRES IN IT WAS ANYBODY'S GUESS 
OH PUT A SOCK IN IT I'M BANGING MY HEAD 
OH 
HENNING WAS JUST AWESOME 
YOU CAN'T GO THIS FAST ON ICE 
IF WE HIT THE SIDE IT'S GOING TO KILL US 
ARGH 
I DON'T WANT TO DIE IN TIGHTS 
FIFTY NINE POINT SIX EIGHT 
DID WE WIN WHAT DID HE DO 
MY GOD I'M BROKEN 
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IT IN FIFTY NINE POINT SIX EIGHT 
COME ON COME ON 
ONE MINUTE TWO SECONDS TWENTY FOUR 
WE WON 
I HOPE I DIDN'T SLOW YOU UP TOO MUCH THAT WAS FANTASTIC 
WE DID IT THAT WAS SOMETHING 
AWESOME YES 
RIGHT THAT WAS LAST YEAR THIS IS NOW AND I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS 
IT'S THE WEEKEND SO RICHARD HAMMOND HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE 
FROM HIS WORLD OF AMUSINGLY SHAPED POTATO CRISPS AND HE'S HERE 
UP UNTIL NOW SUZUKI HAS BEEN WELL KNOWN 
FOR MAKING SMALL JEEPS AND A REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
EVERYTHING ELSE THEY'VE MADE IS ABOUT AS INTERESTING AS THAT TREE 
NO MAYBE THAT ONE IN THE MIDDLE 
BUT NOW OUT OF NOWHERE THEY'VE COME UP WITH THIS THE NEW SWIFT 
AND I DO MEAN OUT OF NOWHERE JUST LOOK AT IT 
WHEN THIS DRIVES PAST YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE IT A SECOND GLANCE 
IT COSTS LESS THAN EIGHT GRAND 
AND YET FOR THAT YOU GET A PERKY THIRTEEN LITRE ENGINE 
C. D. PLAYER ELECTRIC MIRRORS TINTED GLASS AND SOME AIR BAGS 
IT DOES JUST ABOUT THE CLEVEREST THING A SMALL CAR CAN DO 
WHICH IS NOT FEEL LIKE A SMALL CAR 
IT FEELS BIG AND SOLID IT FEELS GROWN UP 
WHICH CONSIDERING WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO WITH IT IS A GOOD THING 
THE LAST TIME WE TESTED A SMALL CAR 
WE ENDED UP PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH TEN OF THEM 
THEY WERE TOYOTA AYGOS AND FRANKLY IT ALL GOT A BIT MESSY 
THE THING IS IT'S A BIT NIPPY FOR FOOTBALL IN THESE CONDITIONS 
BUT DON'T DESPAIR 
BECAUSE WE CAN DO THIS 
I DECLARE 
THE TOP GEAR WINTER OLYMPICS 
SUZUKI SWIFT CAR ICE HOCKEY CHA 
OPEN 
YES THIS IS THE PITCH 
AND THESE ARE THE PLAYERS TEN SUZUKI SWIFTS 
MAKING IT FIVE A SIDE ALL PILOTED BY LOCAL RALLY DRIVERS 
JAMES AND I WOULD BE TEAM CAPTAINS 
IT'S NOT DIFFICULT 
ICE HOCKEY IS BASICALLY THE MOST VIOLENT SPORT IN THE WORLD 
SO 
SO IF YOU BITE JAMES 
YEAH NO I MEAN IF IT GETS 
IF THERE IS A DEATH THEN YOU HAVE TO PUT SOMEBODY IN THE SIN BIN 
THAT'S WHEN I BLOW MY HORN YES 
SO I HAVE TO STOP THE GAME AND BLOW THIS YES SO 
THE END'S COME OFF 
WITH THE STANDS PACKED TO THE RAFTERS 
AND THE GIANT PUCK IN PLACE 
WE WERE READY FOR THE OFF 
THE BLUE TEAM CAPTAINED BY CAPTAIN SLOW THAT'S PRIMETIME T. V. 
THE RED TEAM CAPTAINED BY RICHARD PHILIP SCOFIELD HAMMOND 
THAT'S PLAYTIME T. V. ARE WE READY 
WITHIN A MINUTE DAYTIME T. V. SCORED GOAL 
IS IT A GOAL IN ICE HOCKEY YEAH 
THERE WERE A LOT OF CRASHES WHEN WE DID THIS PLAYING FOOTBALL 
I THINK BY PLAYING ON ICE WE'VE MADE IT A LOT SAFER 
DESPITE MY BEST FOOTBALL CLICHES 
HOWIE'S UP LIKE A SALMON IT'S THE OLD ONE TWO 
TEAM PRIMETIME WERE ALL OVER THE PLACE 
IT'S GONE WIDE 
MEANWHILE DAYTIME T. V. WERE ON FIRE 
AND DESPITE AN OBVIOUSLY BIASED REF 
GO ON JAMES 
GO ON MAN YOU'VE GOT IT OH 
WE BANKED GOAL TWO 
GOAL 
AND GOAL THREE 
IN QUICK SUCCESSION 
WHO'S PRIMETIME NOW THEN BOYS 
YES MY TEAM WERE BEING TROUNCED 
AND WHEN WE FINALLY DID SCORE 
YEAH 
GUESS WHO WAS OTHERWISE ENGAGED 
YES ALL IN ALL THE REF'S GRASP OF THE GAME WAS POOR 
WHY HAS THAT HAPPENED THAT'S AND WHY HAVEN'T YOU SCORED 
WE HAVE SCORED WELL I HAVEN'T SEEN IT WE JUST SCORED THERE 
WHO'S THE REFEREE I FELL OVER A BIT DID YOU YOU MISSED THE GOAL 
I MISSED THE GOAL WELL IT'S NOT A GOAL 
ARE YOU PREPARED TO ACCEPT MY WORD AS A PRIMETIME T. V. PRESENTER 
THAT WE SCORED A SUPERB GOAL YES THANK YOU 
DAYTIME WAS STILL TWO GOALS AHEAD THOUGH 
AND THE REF DIDN'T LIKE THAT 
WHAT 
IT'S IN THE MIDDLE 
JAMES TOOK IMMEDIATE ADVANTAGE 
COME ON BOYS 
THREE THREE 
THAT'S IN THAT'S LOVELY 
GOAL 
GIVE HIM A MEGAPHONE HE'S HAPPY 
BUT MOMENTS LATER JAMES CRASHED INTO HIS OWN MAN 
LEAVING HIS GOAL MOUTH WIDE OPEN FOR ME 
HA 
AFTER THAT THE MATCH REALLY HOTTED UP 
FOR MOST PEOPLE THAT IS 
OH IS THAT A BEER 
THANKS 
OH NO IT'S HAMMOND 
BLOODY HELL JAMES 
STILL ANOTHER GOAL FOR DAYTIME MAKING THE SCORE 
UH THAT'S 
FIVE THREE WHAT 
WHAT IS IT 
AS THE GAME ENTERED ITS FINAL STAGES 
THE VIOLENCE REACHED PROPER ICE HOCKEY LEVELS 
THERE'S MY BUMPER NEVER MIND 
THESE ARE PROVING THEMSELVES TO BE TOUGH LITTLE CARS I MUST SAY 
UPSIDE DOWN 
DO YOU HAVE A VACUUM CLEANER VACUUM CLEANER 
DOES TOP GEAR HAVE A VACUUM CLEANER NO 
RED TWO WAS OUT OF ACTION BUT MY JOY WAS SHORT LIVED 
THERE'S A SPARE CAR WE'RE WRITING NUMBER TWO ON IT AS WE SPEAK 
WE'LL BE BACK IN BUSINESS WITH NINETY SECONDS OF PLAY LEFT 
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON I AM TOTALLY IMPARTIAL I'VE GIVEN YOU EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY 
RUBBISH I I'VE SCORED TWO BRILLIANT GOALS 
WHILST YOU'VE BEEN CHATTING UP SOME NORWEGIAN WOMEN IN THE BAR 
MY WIFE YES IT WAS YOUR WIFE HIS WIFE 
WITH PLAY ALMOST OVER 
I ACCIDENTALLY BUT VERY ACCURATELY TOOK OUT JAMES 
I'M OUT HAMMOND IN THE SIN BIN 
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M IN THE SIN BIN FOR WHAT 
GO ON I. T. V. YOU GO IN THE SIN BIN IT'S THAT SIMPLE 
WITH ME SHACKLED PRIMETIME BROUGHT THE SCORE UP TO FIVE FOUR 
OH REF 
HAMMOND YOU MAY REJOIN 
THAT'S THE END OF THE GAME 
NO MATTER DAYTIME HAD WON 
WHICH MEANT FOR JAMES THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE POST MATCH DRINK 
SO HOW WAS THE SNOW IT WAS GOLDEN THANK YOU JEREMY 
AND THAT GENTLEMEN IS HOW YOU DO THAT I MUST GET BACK TO THE WORLD OF LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT 
I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU WHY 
COS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING NEXT WHICH IS 
THAT 
OH YOU ARE JOKING 
I AM STAYING 
THIS IS THE SKI JUMP AT LILLEHAMMER THE VERY ONE USED IN THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WINTER OLYMPICS 
IT OFFERS JUMPERS FOUR HUNDRED FEET OF PURE UNBRIDLED TERROR 
RIGHT CHAPS WE HAVE GOT TO GET THAT 
TO JUMP FURTHER THAN HIM 
IN THE TOP GEAR WINTER OLYMPICS SKI SLASH CAR JUMPING CHAMPIO 
HMM A TWENTY YEAR OLD SLIGHTLY RUSTY LEYLAND MINI 
FOURTEEN SECONDS 
NO HANG ON THAT'S NOT RELEVANT 
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY GRIP OFF THE TYRE ALL YOU'VE GOT IS GRAVITY 
OH GRAVITY'S A CRUEL AND UNPREDICTABLE MISTRESS SO NO IT ISN'T 
IT'S A CONSTANT ALL OVER THE WORLD 
THIS IS SIMPLE ARITHMETICALLY IT'S V. EQUALS U. AT 
WE KNOW ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY IS NINETY EIGHT METRES PER SECOND SQUARED 
BUT THAT'S WEIGHT COMPONENT DOWN A PLANE BECAUSE IT'S ON A SLOPE 
SO WE NEED TO GET THE MASS OF THE CAR THE ANGLE OF THE SLOPE AND THE ANGLE OF WHERE IT JUMPS OFF 
THAT WILL GIVE US V. WE SHOULD THEN BE ABLE TO CALCULATE 
THE POINT WHERE THE CAR MEETS THE SNOW 
I THINK WE SHOULD GO AND GET A CUP OF TEA AND WORK THAT OUT 
COME ON JAMES HANG ON 
IS GRAVITY GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO GET THE CAR DOWN THE RAMP AND BEAT THE SKIER 
NO 
RIGHT WE HAVE A PROBLEM WE NEED MORE PROPULSION BECAUSE WE CAN'T USE THE ENGINE 
BECAUSE THAT'LL JUST SPIN THE WHEELS RIGHT 
ALSO WE CAN'T PUT A DRIVER IN IT BECAUSE HE'LL BE KILLED 
SO WE'LL HAVE TO WORK SOMETHING OUT ON STEERING THAT CAN BE YOUR JOB 
O. K. THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM ONCE IT'S SET OFF WE'VE GOT TO STOP IT 
OTHERWISE IT'LL JUST SOAR OVER THERE AND TAKE OUT LILLEHAMMER I'LL WORK OUT HOW TO STOP IT 
RIGHT GUIDANCE FOR YOU STOPPING BRAKING FOR YOU 
AND THEN I'LL FIGURE OUT SOME WAY OF POWER POWER EXACTLY 
LET'S GET ABOUT OUR BUSINESS 
I'LL TAKE MY TEA EARL GREY IN NORWAY WHOEVER WOULD'VE THOUGHT IT 
OUR FIRST JOB WAS TO MARK THE POINT WHERE THE SKIER HAD LANDED 
SO WE KNEW THE DISTANCE TO BEAT 
UNFORTUNATELY JAMES WAS NO SIR EDMUND HILLARY 
YOU'VE GOT TO SPRAY PAINT IT 
THERE YOU GO I'VE DONE IT 
YOU'VE GOT TO CROSS IT NO THAT'LL DO IT WON'T DO 
SHUT UP 
HOW HARD CAN IT BE 
WITH JAMES PROVING HIS OWN LAWS OF GRAVITY 
I GOT ON WITH THE BUSINESS OF POWER 
HI IS THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM ROCKETRY ASSOCIATION 
YEAH IT'S JEREMY CLARKSON HERE FROM TOP GEAR I NEED SOME ROCKETS 
SOON THOUGH IT WENT DARK AGAIN 
SO WE WENT TO THE PUB 
THE NEXT MORNING THE ROCKETEERS ARRIVED 
AND ANNOUNCED THAT THEY COULD GIVE THE MINI TWICE AS MUCH THRUST 
POUND FOR POUND THAN AN F. FIFTEEN JET FIGHTER 
I'VE TAKEN DRAG AERODYNAMIC DRAG SKI FRICTION GRAVITY 
AND THE THRUST OF THREE ROCKET MOTORS INTO ACCOUNT 
THIS IS ROCKET SCIENCE THIS IS 
BUT THEN I SAW THE ROCKETS' 
YOU CAN BUY THESE FROM POST OFFICES IN NOVEMBER 
ARE THESE REALLY GONNA GIVE ENOUGH THRUST THEY ARE 
AS MUCH THRUST AS YOU CAN HANDLE SO WE PUT THEM HERE 
OH JEREMY THAT WAY ROUND 
DOWN HERE TAKE THE BOOT OUT 
YEP RIP THAT OUT LET'S HAVE A BOOT PULL 
MEANWHILE I'D CHOSEN A SPOT TO BUILD MY SNOWMAN 
I THINK ABOUT HERE 
OR HERE 
NO 
I THINK 
RIGHT 
HOW FAST WAS THE SKIER GOING WHEN HE LEFT THE THING FIFTY SIX M. P. H. 
WE'RE GONNA BE GOING EIGHTY THREE M. P. H. 
THIS MEANT HAMMOND HAD TO THINK BIG 
RICHARD HAMMOND HOW'S THE BRAKING GOING 
IT'S GOING WELL 
BY THIS STAGE SPIDERMAN HAD FINALLY GOT TO THE TOP OF THE SKI JUMP 
WHEN THE SKIER GOES DOWN 
HOW DOES HE 
HOW DOES HE STAY IN THE MIDDLE 
OH HE HAS SOME TRACKS GROOVES 
LIQUID NITROUS OXIDE YES THAT'S GOT ALL THE OXYGEN IN IT YEP 
AND IN THE BOTTOM END FUEL WHICH IS RUBBER 
HERE'S A TIP PLEASE I'M A DOCTOR OF ENGINEERING TWICE 
IF YOU USE RUBBER AS FUEL 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO AS FAR AS IF YOU USE PETROL OR DYNAMITE 
JEREMY DO YOU THINK YOU COULD MOUNT IT ON SKIS 
WHY WHY DOES HE WANT SKIS 
IF YOU PUT IT ON SKIS I CAN KEEP IT DEAD STRAIGHT 
WE'D HAVE TO MAKE 'EM WELL YES 
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T GO TO THE SKI RENTAL SHOP AND SAY HAVE YOU GOT SKIS FOR A MINI 
JAMES THE TRACK IS THIRTEEN HUNDRED M. M. 
AND WITH THOSE MEASUREMENTS THE ICE MEN COULD NOW CUT THEIR SPECIAL GROOVES' 
OH YES 
IF I LOSE IT NOW I'M GONNA END UP IN THE LILLEHAMMER ASDA 
THESE SCIENTISTS HAVE FOUND A JOB FOR ME TO DO 
DOES ANYONE WANT EARL GREY NO 
WITH MY SKIS FITTED 
THE ROCKETS INSTALLED 
AND THE ICE GROOVES COMING ALONG NICELY 
JAMES AND I DROPPED IN ON HAMMOND TO INSPECT HIS SNOW BANK 
I CAN GUARANTEE THAT WON'T STOP THE MINI 
PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH 
BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE YOU BUILT THAT IN FRONT OF THAT SLOPE 
AND THE MINI IS COMING DOWN THAT ONE 
RIGHT 
I MIGHT HAVE WHAT A COMPLETE AND UTTER 
SOME ADJUSTMENTS DIDN'T ANYBODY TELL YOU 
NO OBVIOUSLY OR I'D HAVE BUILT IT OVER THERE 
IT'S FAIRLY EMBARRASSING WHAT I NEED 
IS A BIG MACHINE 
SO I GOT MYSELF A PISTE BASHER 
WITH THIS I AM GOING TO CONSTRUCT SOMETHING THAT WILL RIVAL THE HOOVER DAM 
THOSE TWO MUPPETS WILL NOT BE LAUGHING AT ME NOW 
AND TO SPEED THINGS UP I DRAFTED IN A HERD OF TRACTORS 
WHILE PHILIP SCOFIELD WAS BUILDING THE GREAT WALL OF LILLEHAMMER 
OH YEAH 
THE ROCKET CAR PRIMED WITH FIFTEEN TONS OF EXPLOSIVE THRUST 
BEGAN ITS LONG JOURNEY TO THE TOP OF THE JUMP 
AND HALF AN HOUR LATER THE ICE GROOVES WERE READY FOR CHRIS BONINGTON'S APPROVAL 
DON'T COME NEAR ME I'M NOT TOUCHING YOU GO OVER THERE 
I'M NOWHERE NEAR YOU 
THAT'S REALLY NICE 
THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE 
NO WE ARE IN FACT AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF COCKING THE BAT 
THE TIME FOR COCKING A BAT HOWEVER WAS OVER 
THE WALL WAS FINISHED 
THE TARGET WAS LAID DOWN 
AND WE WERE NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE ROCKET MEN 
THEY'RE FILLING THE ROCKET FUEL 
IT'S GOING TO BE AN APPALLING MESS 
AN EXPLOSION A BURNING MINI COMING DOWN ON ITS ROOF 
VENTING RED 
WHITE BLUE GOOD VENTING 
THREE TWO ONE PUSH 
COME ON MINI 
ARMED 
FIVE FOUR THREE TWO 
ONE INITIATE 
WALL'S GONNA BE NEEDED 
WE WERE A BIT SHORT WE DIDN'T BEAT THE SKI JUMPER 
I'M SATISFIED WITH THAT AND ANYWAY I HAVE TO GO I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE WORLD OF DAYTIME TELLY 
BOYS IT'S BEEN A JOY GOODBYE IT'S BEEN GREAT HAVING YOU HERE THANKS FOR COMING 
BYE ACTUALLY WE CAN GO ANYWAY 
COS IT'S THE END OF THE SHOW NO IT ISN'T 
THERE'S ONE MORE THING 
THIS IS A SNOWMOBILE 
IT'S A SORT OF JET SKI WITH A TANK TRACK ON THE BACK 
AND IT'S USED FOR HERDING MOOSES AND GENERALLY LARKING ABOUT 
BUT HERE'S THE THING 
NO ONE IN THE WHOLE OF HUMAN HISTORY HAS EVER ATTEMPTED TO RIDE ONE OF THESE THINGS 
DOWN A SKI JUMP 
THE REASON WHY NO ONE HAS EVER RIDDEN A SKIMOBILE DOWN A SKI JUMP 
IS THE SAME REASON WE DIDN'T PUT ANYONE IN THE MINI LAST NIGHT 
YES COS YOU'D PROBABLY GET KILLED TO DEATH YEP VERY GOOD CHANCE OF THAT 
LUCKILY HOWEVER WE KNOW A MAN WHO HAS NO FEAR 
YOU THOUGHT WE'D FORGOTTEN HIM BUT HE'S HERE THE STIG 
LAND OF HOPE AND GLORY 
IT'S THE LANDING I'M WORRIED ABOUT MOST OF ALL 
AND ON THAT BOMBSHELL OR AS HE WOULD NOW PUT IT 
ON THAT BOMBSHELL 
TIME TO END THE SHOW THANKS VERY MUCH FOR WATCHING GOOD NIGHT
