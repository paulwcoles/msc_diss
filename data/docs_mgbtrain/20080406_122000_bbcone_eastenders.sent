RICKY TOLD ME TOWARDS THE END HE COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK 
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE FRANK BUTCHER WITHOUT SOMETHING TO SAY FOR HIMSELF 
HE WAS ALWAYS GIVING IT PLENTY OF THAT 
FULL OF SCHEMES AND PLANS 
GOOD TIMES WAITING JUST ROUND THE CORNER 
POOR OLD FRANK 
NO MORE SCHEMES OR PLANS HE WANTS ONE LAST RIDE AROUND ALBERT SQUARE 
AND THEN A WAKE HERE 
OR DID I TELL YOU THAT ALREADY 
OH I KEEP REPEATING MYSELF IT'S O. K. 
I'M LIKE AN OLD WOMAN YOU AIN'T AN OLD WOMAN 
WELL I FEEL LIKE IT WELL YOU AIN'T ALL RIGHT 
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING JUST GIVE ME A CALL I GOTTA GET GOING O. K. 
NOT THE FIRST TIME FRANK'S DIED 
NO HIS LAST FUNERAL WAS IN SPAIN 
THEY HAD A SPACE FOR HIM WAITING IN THE WALL 
IN THE WALL THEY DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY OVER THERE 
SO THIS LAST TIME HE DIED 
WELL HE WASN'T REALLY DEAD 
I WORKED THAT OUT FOR MYSELF 
I CAME OUT THE CEMETERY AND I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET 
AND THERE HE WAS SITTING IN THE CAR 
WITH A PAIR OF BIG DARK SHADES COVERING HIS FACE 
SO IT WAS A SCAM 
HA LIFE WAS ONE BIG SCAM WITH FRANK 
BUT PRETENDING TO BE DEAD 
YEAH 
WHAT A SWINE HE WAS A SWINE A CHARLATAN A CON MAN 
AND A CHEAT 
WE AIN'T GOT TIME FOR ANY OF THAT STUFF NOW 
WE HAVE GOT HIS PARTY TO ORGANIZE 
HE'S GOT SOME FRONT AIN'T HE AFTER THE WAY HE'S BEHAVED 
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS PAT BECAUSE HE WANTS IT 
AND WHEN FRANK SAYS JUMP WE SAY HOW HIGH 
BIANCA IT'S ME AGAIN IF YOU COULD

SHE SAID HER GOODBYES THEN 
IT'S NICE YOU'RE HAVING THE FUNERAL FROM THE SQUARE 
IT'S WHAT HE WANTED 
APPARENTLY HE TOLD RICKY THAT HIS HEART WAS HERE 
FRANK BUTCHER DIDN'T HAVE A HEART 
WELL I AGREE IT WASN'T ALWAYS EASY TO FIND IT SOMETIMES 
DEAD AND IN A BOX AND HE'S STILL PULLING THE STRINGS 
THIS PARTY 
THE ONLY THING EITHER ONE OF US COULD DEPEND ON FRANK BUTCHER FOR 
WAS THAT HE'D LET US DOWN 
AND YET HE'S EXPECTING US TO DO ALL THIS FOR HIM 
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT FOR HIM 
I WANT TO DO IT FOR ME 
TO MAKE SENSE OF ALL THOSE YEARS 
NO COS I DON'T FANCY THE ALTERNATIVE 
WHICH IS GOING TO THE CREM 
SINGING A HYMN WATCHING THE CURTAINS CLOSE AND THEN WHAT 
GOING HOME HAVING A CUP OF TEA 
TURNING ON THE TELLY LIKE NOTHING'S HAPPENED 
I DON'T WANT TO CELEBRATE HIS LIFE 
PEGGY WE'VE HAD OUR BATTLES OVER FRANK IN THE PAST YEAH ONCE OR TWICE 
AND WE GOT THROUGH ALL THAT WE'RE HERE AND WE'RE FRIENDS 
PERHAPS THAT'S WORTH CELEBRATING EH 
BESIDES WE BOTH LOVED HIM 
HE DIDN'T LOVE US THOUGH DID HE 
THE ONLY PERSON FRANK BUTCHER EVER LOVED WAS HIMSELF 
ALL RIGHT MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT MAYBE HE DIDN'T LOVE ME OR YOU 
THERE'S NO MAYBE ABOUT IT 
BUT I LOVED HIM AND I THINK YOU LOVED HIM TOO 
SO IF WE HAVE THIS PARTY 
IF WE STAND SIDE BY SIDE AND RAISE OUR GLASSES TOGETHER 
MAYBE JUST MAYBE IT MIGHT MAKE SOME SENSE 
OF THE WHOLE BLOODY MESS 
PUT THIS LOT ON THE TABLE WE CLEARED NEARLY EVERY SHELF IN THE MINUTE MART

HE DIDN'T WANT TO MARRY ME 
PEGGY HE THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T GONNA TURN UP 
THE LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN I DID SHEER PANIC NO 
HE WAS LIKE A RAT IN THE TRAP AND YOU PUT HIM IN THAT TRAP 
I WOULDN'T HAVE TURNED UP IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU YOU MADE IT HAPPEN WHY 
BECAUSE I WANTED TO HELP 
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO KEEP HIM ON THE SQUARE 
YOU DID WANT TO MARRY HIM 
YOU WANTED TO KEEP HIM LIKE A FLY IN YOUR WEB UNTIL YOU WERE READY TO POUNCE 
NO YOU DON'T REGRET MARRYING HIM

WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS MAKING EVERYTHING SO COSY AND NICE 
I'M NOT FRANK WASN'T COSY AND NICE 
HE WANTED EVERYONE TO THINK SO TALKING THE TALK 
WALKING THE WALK MAKING EVERYBODY FEEL LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS 
BUT THAT WASN'T THE REAL FRANK 
THE REAL FRANK WAS HORRIBLE NASTY AND ROTTEN 
NO HE WASN'T RIGHT THROUGH TO THE CORE 
ALL RIGHT SO HE MADE MISTAKES SOMETIMES 
BUT HE WAS THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT HE WAS NO ANGEL 
DEEP DOWN HE WAS PURE GOLD

THAT SOMEHOW EVERYTHING WOULD BE WAITING FOR US HERE LIKE IT USED TO BE 
NOT REALLY NO 
I'M NOT PROUD OF MYSELF PEGGY 
I WAS ASHAMED THEN AND I'M ASHAMED NOW 
THE ONLY EXCUSE I'VE GOT IS THAT WHEN I WAS A YOUNG GIRL 
I MET THIS BLOKE AND FELL IN LOVE 
AND THAT LOVE LASTED THE WHOLE OF MY LIFE 
OH NICE PERFORMANCE PAT YOU KNOW MISTY EYES QUIVERING LIP 
YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN FRANK A RUN FOR HIS MONEY 
I DIDN'T ALWAYS LIKE HIM SOMETIMES I HATED HIM 
BUT I NEVER STOPPED LOVING HIM OH PLEASE 
YOU OBVIOUSLY NEVER HAD WITH ANYBODY WHAT I HAD WITH FRANK I LOVED MY ERIC 
NOT LIKE I LOVED FRANK OR YOU'D UNDERSTAND 
NEXT YOU'LL BE TELLING ME IT WAS A TRULY BEAUTIFUL THING 
IT WASN'T BEAUTIFUL 
IT WASN'T UGLY NEITHER IT WAS JUST WHAT IT WAS 
THE LAST TIME I SAW FRANK WAS JUST AFTER JANINE'S TRIAL 
D'YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID TO ME 
HE SAID TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF BABE 
AND I SAID I'M TOO OLD TO BE ANYBODY'S BABE 
AND HE SAID 
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MINE RIGHT UP TO MY LAST BREATH AND BEYOND 
OH THEY WERE WORDS 
THEY CAME EASY TO FRANK 
DONT MEAN A THING IT'S LIKE BANGING ON A DRUM EMPTY NOISE NO 
D'YOU REMEMBER DOWNSTAIRS THE DAY I MARRIED HIM 
DO YOU REMEMBER HIM STANDING IN THE BAR TELLING ME AND THE WHOLE OF WALFORD HOW MUCH HE LOVED ME 
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT SPEECH 
YEAH OH HE WAS GOOD VERY VERY GOOD HE EVEN CONVINCED HIMSELF 
D'YOU REMEMBER HOW HE WIPED THAT TEAR AWAY FROM HIS EYE 
YEAH 
WELL IT WAS AN ACT FRANK WAS A SHOWMAN 
HE LIKED PEOPLE LOOKING AT HIM HE LOVED TO HEAR THE SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE 
HE ENJOYED TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR MAKING THEM LAUGH MAKING THEM CRY 
BUT THE MINUTE THEY WERE OUT OF HIS LINE OF VISION HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT THEM 
HE DIDN'T LOVE ME 
AND HE DIDN'T LOVE YOU 
HE WASN'T WORTH THE TIME EITHER ONE OF US SQUANDERED ON HIM 
PERHAPS HE WAS A WASTER 
IN SOME WAYS A NO GOOD SON OF A. 
CLEVER MAN THOUGH OH YEAH YEAH HE WAS CLEVER ALL RIGHT 
ALL DUE RESPECT PEGGY I DON'T THINK HE WAS EVER COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU 
OH TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW 
NO HE DIDN'T LET YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS THINKING 
NO OFFENCE PEGGY BUT I DON'T THINK HE SAW YOU AS HIS EQUAL I BEG YOUR PARDON 
WELL WE JUST SAID IT DIDN'T WE HE WAS A CLEVER MAN EASILY BORED YOU TELLING ME I'M STUPID 
I THINK HE PREFERRED SOMEBODY TO KEEP UP WITH HIM YOU WHAT SOMEBODY SHARP AND THAT WAS YOU 
YOU SAID IT ME AND FRANK CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH WE UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER 
YOU'LL BE TELLING ME HE WANTED YOU FOR YOUR MIND 
WE WERE SOUL MATES 
WILL YOU LISTEN TO YOURSELF YOU STUPID FAT OLD TART 
THE ONLY THING FRANK BUTCHER WANTED FROM YOU WAS SEX

AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN STAY AROUND TO SAY TA 
I WAS IN A STATE THAT DAY 
HE WAS PRETTY UPSET HIMSELF I WASN'T THINKING STRAIGHT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING

AND THEN WHEN HE MIGHT BE USEFUL AGAIN WELL GUESS WHAT UP YOU POP 
AND I NEARLY BOUGHT THAT TEARFUL LITTLE GIRL ACT 
WHATEVER ELSE I'VE DONE ALL RIGHT 
NO MATTER HOW I TREATED HIM SOMETIMES BELIEVE ME I LOVED MY DAD 
OF COURSE YOU NEVER STOPPED EVER SINCE YOU WAS A LITTLE GIRL DID YA 
I'VE TOLD YOU HOW I USED TO WAIT FOR HIM OUTSIDE OUR FRONT GATE

BUT WE CAN'T STAY THERE IT'S AGAINST THE RULES OR SOMETHING 
ONLY YOU HAVE BEEN IN RECEIPT OF HOUSING BENEFIT 
SO 
WHICH WAS INTENDED TO PAY YOUR RENT 
LIKE I SAID IT'S DIFFICULT KEEPING TRACK 
ALL RIGHT LOOK MAYBE I DID SPEND SOME OF IT ON FOOD AND STUFF SMACK ME 
IT'S JUST THAT IF YOU'VE BEEN EVICTED FOR NOT PAYING RENT 
EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE BEEN RECEIVING HOUSING BENEFIT 
WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER YOU'RE INTENTIONALLY HOMELESS INTENTIONALLY 
WE NEED TO ASSESS WHETHER YOUR ACTIONS HAVE LED TO YOUR BEING HOMELESS AND WHAT IF THEY HAVE 
THEN WE'RE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO HOUSE YOU 
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T BE HELPED
