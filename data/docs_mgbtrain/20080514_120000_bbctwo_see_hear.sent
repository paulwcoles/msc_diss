WE'RE FINALLY HERE THERE'S NO GOING BACK NOW 
I WISH YOU COULD ALL EXPERIENCE IT AS WELL 
AND FEEL HOW I FEEL AT THE MOMENT IT'S JUST COMPLETELY AMAZING 
HELLO I'M OLIVER WESTBURY 
BACK IN JANUARY ON SEE HEAR YOU SAW ME TRAINING AND FUNDRAISING 
FOR THE NATIONAL DEAF CHILDREN'S SOCIETY'S NORTH POLE CHALLENGE 
MY SEVENTIES STYLE NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY RAISED TWELVE THOUSAND 
PRETTY GOOD BUT MY TARGET WAS TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
OLIVER'S ALWAYS WANTED TO TAKE ON CHALLENGES 
AND PUSH HIMSELF TO THE LIMIT 
AND WHEN HIS FATHER DIED THREE YEARS AGO 
IT WAS JUST BEFORE HE RAN HIS FIRST MARATHON 
HIS FATHER RAN MARATHONS AND HE TOLD OLIVER 
THAT ONCE HE'D RUN ONE MARATHON HE'LL NEVER WANT TO RUN ANOTHER 
AND THAT GAVE OLIVER THE GRIT AND DETERMINATION TO RUN MORE MARATHONS 
I STARTED DOING MARATHONS HAVING SET MYSELF THAT AS A CHALLENGE 
BUT I ALWAYS WANTED TO STRETCH MYSELF 
AND NEXT WAS TO DO SOMETHING BIG FOR CHARITY 
SO WHEN A FRIEND SUGGESTED THE NORTH POLE 
I THOUGHT I'VE GOT TO GRAB THIS OPPORTUNITY 
IT WAS THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME 
THE CHALLENGE WAS ORGANISED BY THE NDCS 
WHO SUPPORT DEAF CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES 
AND HELP THEM TO DEVELOP THEIR POTENTIAL 
THE ORIGINAL IDEA CAME TO US ROUND ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO NOW 
WE WERE LOOKING AT A MAGAZINE AND SAW AN EXPEDITION 
THAT WAS RUN BY MIKE FROM POLAR CHALLENGE 
HE SUGGESTED WE TAKE FOUR OR FIVE PEOPLE ON THIS EXTREME EXPEDITION 
AND REALLY IT ALL SNOWBALLED FROM THERE 
THERE ARE SEVEN OF US IN THE TEAM GOING TO THE NORTH POLE 
THERE'S THE LEADER ASSISTANT LEADER THEN FIVE OF US 
WHO FOR THE NDCS WILL RAISE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND EACH 
I'M THE ONLY PROFOUNDLY DEAF BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE USER IN THE GROUP 
THEN THERE'S CARL MORRIS 
WHO BECAME DEAF AFTER CONTRACTING MENINGITIS AT THE AGE OF THREE 
AND NOW HAS A COCHLEAR IMPLANT 
AND IAN BERRY WHO BECAME DEAF ABOUT A YEAR AGO 
BUT HAS BEEN LEARNING SIGNING AT LEVELS ONE AND TWO 
THE REMAINING TWO ARE HEARING SO THAT'S THE GROUP 
THIS REALLY IS THE FIRST EXPEDITION OF ITS KIND 
WE ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO TAKE DEAF PEOPLE TO THE NORTH POLE 
GOING TO THE NORTH POLE AND LEADING A LAST DEGREE TRIP 
IS ALWAYS FAIRLY HAZARDOUS ANYWAY 
TAKING A GROUP THAT ARE MIXED DEAF AND HEARING 
WILL ONLY ADD TO THAT CHALLENGE 
THE NORTH POLE HAS ALWAYS CAPTURED THE IMAGINATION OF EXPLORERS 
ROBERT PEARY IN NINETEEN OH NINE CLAIMED TO BE THE FIRST TO GET THERE 
BUT THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONTROVERSIAL 
THE FIRST DEAF MAN TO REACH THE NORTH POLE WAS FROM JAPAN 
HAVING ARRIVED BY BOAT IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
BUT WE WERE THE FIRST DEAF GROUP TO ATTEMPT A SEVENTY MILE TREK 
BETWEEN EIGHTY NINE AND NINETY DEGREES NORTH 
THE GEOGRAPHIC NORTH POLE 
EVERY SPRING WHEN IT'S LIGHT ENOUGH 
PEOPLE TRY TO REACH THE POLE 
BUT THE AREA IS DECREASING IN SIZE 
THERE'S THINNING ICE OPEN WATER AND STORMS TO CONTEND WITH 
LAST YEAR SEVERAL EXPLORERS WERE FORCED TO SCRAP THEIR MISSIONS 
DUE TO THESE RESULTS OF THE WARMER CLIMATE 
MY DREAM OF GOING TO THE NORTH POLE WAS GETTING CLOSER 
BUT I HAD TO PASS MIKE'S TOUGH FITNESS TEST 
BEFORE MY PLACE ON THE EXPEDITION WAS CONFIRMED 
COUNTING MY STEPS HELPED ME FOCUS 
AND I DROVE MYSELF FORWARD TO THE FINISH 
I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THAT I'D COMPLETED IT IN SIXTEEN MINUTES 
I'D PASSED THE TEST YES 
THE CHALLENGE OF JOINING THIS TRIP IS NOT JUST ABOUT FITTING IN 
BEING STRONG ENOUGH AND BEING ABLE TO MAKE THE JOURNEY 
IT'S ABOUT RAISING THE MONEY 
EACH PERSON HAS GOT TO RAISE WELL OVER TWENTY THOUSAND 
OF WHICH A LARGE PART IS PAYING FOR THE LOGISTICS 
AND THE OTHER PART IS GOING TOWARDS THE NDCS 
ONE OF MY FUNDRAISING ACTIVITIES WAS TO GROW A BEARD 
THE IDEA WAS THAT FOR EVERY WEEK I DIDN'T SHAVE I GOT PAID MORE 
PUTTING MY FILMS ON FACEBOOK INCREASED THE BIDS 
THE BEARD GOT BUSHIER AND BUSHIER UNTIL FINALLY OFF IT CAME 
AFTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS 
WE'RE JUST STAGGERED BY HOW MUCH EFFORT AND ENERGY 
HE'S PUT INTO IT ALL 
AND SO GLAD THAT HE'S COME TO DO THIS FOR NDCS 
RECENTLY I HELD BRITAIN'S FIRST EVER DEAF POKER NIGHT 
WHICH RAISED ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED 
THEN MY MUM ORGANISED A BARN DANCE ALSO RAISING ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED 
MIKE THORNEWILL HAD BEEN TO THE NORTH POLE FOUR TIMES BEFORE 
HE AND HIS WIFE 
WERE THE FIRST COUPLE TO TREK TO BOTH THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLES 
WITH SUCH VAST EXPERIENCE MIKE WAS BRILLIANT AS OUR LEADER 
AS HE KNEW EXACTLY HOW TO PREPARE US FOR THE TRIP AHEAD 
DOWN TO THE SIDE 
AT THE POLE THERE ARE OFTEN BREAKS IN THE ICE THAT WE'D NEED TO CROSS 
SO WE PRACTISED GETTING OURSELVES AND OUR KIT ACROSS THE WATER 
IN A TINY DINGHY 
TENTS HAD TO BE PUT UP REALLY QUICKLY 
IN ORDER TO GET IN AND GET WARM 
AND THE CHALLENGE OF SIGNING WITH THICK MITTENS ON 
WAS ADDRESSED AT DEAF AWARENESS TRAINING 
COMMUNICATION ON ANY EXPEDITION IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL 
AND ON THIS TRIP IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN MORE CHALLENGING 
THAN ANYTHING I'VE EVER DONE BEFORE 
CLEARLY HEARING PEOPLE NON HEARING PEOPLE 
MAKING SURE THEY ALL GET ON THERE'S NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS 
WHEREVER THERE'S DANGERS OR RISKS 
BE ABLE TO EXPRESS WHAT THOSE RISKS ARE 
AT THE DEAF AWARENESS TRAINING DAY 
WE PUT ON MITTENS AND PRACTISED SIGNS LIKE DANGER 
ALL CLEAR ON THE RIGHT AND SO ON 
THAT'S BECAUSE THE THICKNESS OF THE ICE VARIES 
SO YOU NEED TO SIGNAL WHICH SIDE IS SAFE 
THIS IS THE SIGN FOR POLAR BEAR 
SO IF YOU SEE ONE YOU SIGN POLAR BEAR 
THAT TELLS EVERYONE TO MOVE BEHIND THE TEAM LEADER CARRYING THE GUN 
WE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY COMING UP WITH SOME FORTY SIGNS 
WEARING THE MITTENS 
I THINK THE TEAM ARE EXCELLENT 
I'M VERY HAPPY WITH HOW QUICKLY THEY'VE LEARNED EVERYTHING 
I DON'T ENVISAGE THERE WILL BE ANY GREAT PROBLEMS WITH COMMUNICATION 
THE WAY I'VE SEEN PEOPLE BEHAVING TODAY 
TODAY'S BEEN A GOOD DAY 
A FEW MONTHS AGO WE WERE GIVEN THIS LIST 
IT'S A KIT LIST OF ALL THE CLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT 
THAT WE NEED TO TAKE WITH US TWO PAGES OF STUFF 
THESE ARE OUR TREK BOOTS LOOK HOW BIG THEY ARE 
THESE CLIPS FASTEN ONTO THE BACK OF MY TROUSERS 
SO THAT I CAN CLIP THE SLEIGH ONTO ME 
I'LL BE PULLING EIGHTY K. G. WHICH IS REALLY HEAVY 
EQUIVALENT TO THE WEIGHT OF ONE MAN 
SO WHY TWO 
WELL THIS ONE'S FOR YOUR DRINKING WATER 
AND THAT ONE'S FOR YOUR URINE 
IN THE TENT YOU WEE INTO IT AND THEN THROW IT AWAY 
I MUST BE CAREFUL TO DRINK FROM THE RIGHT ONE 
AND HERE'S THE BRITISH FLAG 
WE'LL ADD THE WORD DEAF ACROSS THE MIDDLE 
IT'S NOW TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT I CAN'T SLEEP 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S MY LAST NIGHT BEFORE I FLY OFF TO RUSSIA 
WHERE I'LL THEN TREK ALL THE WAY TO THE NORTH POLE 
IT'S ALMOST HERE 
I'M EXCITED 
BUT ALSO A BIT NERVOUS ABOUT THE DANGERS AND RISKS 
AM I BRAVE AM I MAD 
WOW MY CHILDHOOD DREAM OF GOING TO THE NORTH POLE HAS COME TRUE 
TODAY'S THE DAY AND I'VE BEEN GIVEN THIS BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY 
WE FLEW FIRST TO OSLO THEN ON TO LONGYEARBYEN 
ARRIVING AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
WE'VE FINALLY ARRIVED AT LONGYEARBYEN 
AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD AT SEVENTY FIVE DEGREES NORTH 
IT'S FREEZING I RECKON IT'S MINUS FIVE 
I'VE GOT GOOSE PIMPLES ALREADY I'M OFF INSIDE NOW 
WE WERE HERE FOR TWO DAYS TO DO OUR FINAL TRAINING 
BEFORE HEADING ON TO EIGHTY NINE DEGREES NORTH 
WE LEARNT ESSENTIAL SURVIVAL SKILLS 
WE WERE GETTING THE HANG OF OUR SKIS AND THE CAMERA 
SO HOW AM I FEELING 
WELL IT'S OUR LAST NIGHT 
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN 
IT'S LIKE I DON'T KNOW IT'S HARD 
FOR SURE THERE'S NO MORE TRAINING 
IT'S SERIOUS BUSINESS NOW 
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ERRORS ALL OUR LIVES ARE AT RISK 
YEAH YOU CAN SEE I'M NERVOUS 
O. K. 
WITH US WERE TWO OTHER TEAMS ALSO HOPING TO MAKE IT TO THE POLE 
ICE STATION BARNEO IS ONE HUNDRED K. M. SOUTH OF THE POLE ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE 
AS WE GOT OFF THE PLANE THE COLD REALLY HIT US 
WE'RE NOW ON A HELICOPTER FLYING FROM ICE STATION BARNEO 
TO OUR DROP OFF POINT AT EIGHTY NINE DEGREES NORTH 
WHERE WE BEGIN OUR EXPEDITION TO THE NORTH POLE YES 
WE ARRIVED REALLY LATE AND SET UP CAMP 
IT HIT ME JUST HOW ISOLATED WE WERE 
WOW 
IT'S OUR FIRST NIGHT IN A TENT ON THE ICE 
WE'RE AT EIGHTY NINE DEGREES NORTH WHERE THE HELICOPTER HAS JUST DROPPED US OFF 
IT'S TIME FOR A REST AND ALTHOUGH IT'S LIGHT 
IT'S ACTUALLY ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
IT'S SO LIGHT IT'S LIKE WAKING UP AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING 
IT'S STRANGE AND I'M DUE TO GO TO BED SOON WEIRD 
WE'RE COOKING DINNER NOW 
IT'S ONE IN THE MORNING AND WE'RE HAVING DINNER 
INTERESTING 
HELLO WE'RE NOW AT EIGHTY NINE DEGREES NORTH ON THE FIRST DAY OF OUR TREK 
WE'VE GOT OUR KIT SLEDS AND STICKS 
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT TOO COLD 
WE'RE GOING TO BE WALKING ROUGHLY NINE TO TEN MILES THAT A WAY 
IN THE MORNING WE PACKED UP CAMP AND SET OFF 
WHEN CARL'S SKI BINDING BROKE 
HE HAD TO WALK THE REST OF THE DAY OFTEN IN DEEP SNOW 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE USED OUR DINGHY TO CROSS THE WATER 
THE OPEN WATER HAS COME FROM BREAKS IN THE PACK ICE 
THAT DAY ON THE WATER CARL BOARDED THE DINGHY DANGEROUSLY 
MIKE TRIED TO WARN HIM BUT BECAUSE HE WAS WEARING A BALACLAVA 
CARL COULDN'T LIPREAD HIM 
WE SHOULD HAVE COVERED TEN MILES THAT DAY 
BUT ONLY MANAGED FIVE BECAUSE OF THE WATER 
WE FINALLY GOT HERE ABOUT HALF SIX IN THE EVENING 
BY THEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FREEZING 
YOU CAN SEE HOW MY BEARD HAS FROZEN UP 
IT'S BEEN TOUGH GOING WITH US ALL WALKING IN A LINE 
I'M WORN OUT 
I'LL GRAB SOME FOOD IN THE TENT 
CARL BROKE ONE OF HIS SKI BINDINGS 
REALLY BECAUSE HE WAS WADDLING ABOUT ALL OVER THE PLACE 
COME ON 
IT IS BROKEN LOOK 
AT THE NORTH POLE THE ICE CONSTANTLY SHIFTS 
AS IT FLOATS ON THE ARCTIC OCEAN 
WITH PRESSURE RIDGES AND LARGE CRACKS APPEARING 
THESE CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME WITHIN MINUTES OR OVER A FEW HOURS 
CREATING DANGERS FOR THE TEAM 
YOU CAN SEE HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS 
WE WERE TRYING TO SKI ACROSS WITH OUR HEAVY BOOTS 
AND SLEDS WEIGHING EIGHTY K. G. 
THIS WAS US TRYING TO GET ACROSS A CRACK IN THE ICE 
THE SEA WAS THREE MILES DEEP AND FREEZING 
SO WE DIDN'T WANT TO FALL IN 
IT WAS EVEN DIFFICULT FOR OUR MOST EXPERIENCED GUIDES 
AT THE END OF THE DAY SETTING UP CAMP 
WE ALL HAD OUR DIFFERENT ROLES TO PLAY 
SO THAT WE COULD PUT THE TENTS UP AND GET INSIDE 
TO EAT AND GET WARM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
EVERYBODY'S WORKED REALLY HARD TODAY 
WE'VE DONE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE GETTING TOWARDS FOURTEEN KILOMETRES 
WHICH WAS MORE THAN WE HAD ACTUALLY HOPED FOR SO FANTASTIC 
I'VE HAD A REALLY GOOD DAY IT'S BEEN VERY INTERESTING 
AND I'VE DONE THINGS THAT I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD EVER DO BEFORE 
WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY TO THE NORTH POLE WHICH I'M REALLY HAPPY ABOUT 
I'VE GOT THE POSITION NOW THE ARCTIC ICE MOVES LIKE A TURNTABLE 
SO YOU DON'T WALK IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
YOU HAVE TO KEEP CHECKING YOUR COMPASS AND USE CAREFUL NAVIGATING 
TO ENSURE YOU DON'T VEER OFF COURSE 
IF YOU WALK IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
LIKE THIS OTHER EXPEDITION TEAM WE MET 
AND WHO WERE TRYING TO GET TO THE NORTH POLE 
THEY WALKED IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
AND A MILE LATER WERE STILL IN THE SAME PLACE 
LAST NIGHT WHILST WE WERE SITTING IN THE TENT WE HAD A NORTHERLY DRIFT 
AND WE COVERED ROUND ABOUT JUST OVER A NAUTICAL MILE 
INSIDE THE TENT SITTING THERE DRINKING OUR TEA 
AND SLEEPING OF COURSE WHICH WAS GREAT 
THE BEAUTIFUL AND STARK WHITE LANDSCAPE 
REMINDED US OF THE MOON'S SURFACE 
THERE WERE AREAS OF FLAT FROZEN ICE WITH SNOW ICE BOULDERS 
PRESSURE RIDGES AND CRACKS IN THE ICE 
IT WAS STUNNING 
WE'VE BEEN WALKING ALL DAY 
FROM NINE IN THE MORNING TILL SIX IN THE EVENING EIGHT HOURS 
COVERING ABOUT EIGHT MILES 
SOME PEOPLE IN THE TEAM HAVE BLISTERS ON THEIR FEET 
THAT'S TOUGH 
YOU NEED SPECIAL SOCKS INDIVIDUALLY TAILORED FOR YOUR FEET 
YOU THEN NEED THREE LAYERS OF SOCKS AND PROPER BOOTS 
IF YOU DON'T YOU'LL HAVE BLISTERS FOR SURE 
WE HAVE CREAM AND POWDER TO HELP 
AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL MAKE IT THROUGH THE TEN DAYS OF WALKING 
WE'RE ONLY FIFTEEN MILES FROM THE POLE 
IT'S BITTERLY COLD AND AS YOU CAN SEE WE'RE WALKING REALLY SLOWLY 
IT'S TAKING ABOUT ONE HOUR TO COVER ONE MILE 
IT'S FREEZING I'M ICING UP 
I HAVE TO GET GOING WE'RE NOT FINISHED YET 
HELLO NOW I'M IN THE TENT ABOUT TEN MILES FROM THE NORTH POLE 
IT'S NOT FAR NOW 
ALTOGETHER WE'VE TREKKED ABOUT FORTY MILES 
TEN MILES TO GO YES 
OVERNIGHT WE FLOATED ABOUT FOUR MILES 
THAT'S HOW FAST THE DRIFT WAS 
IF THE ICE FLOW WENT TOO FAR WEST 
WE'D HAVE MISSED THE NORTH POLE COMPLETELY 
SO WE HIT A REALLY FAST PACE TO AVOID GOING OFF COURSE 
ZERO POINT EIGHT MILES OVER THERE IS THE NORTH POLE 
WE'RE ALMOST THERE COME ON 
YES DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE WE'RE AT THE NORTH POLE 
NINETY DEGREES NORTH LOOK 
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING FOR ALL YOUR HELP 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY FREEZING AND I'VE JUST TREKKED FIFTY MILES TO GET HERE 
TO THE TOP OF THE WORLD 
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL VIEW 
IT'S SUNNY BUT THE WIND CHILL FACTOR 
MAKES IT FEEL SOMETHING LIKE MINUS TWENTY OR MINUS THIRTY 
O. K. THANK YOU YES 
I WISH YOU COULD ALL EXPERIENCE IT AS WELL 
AND FEEL HOW I FEEL AT THE MOMENT IT'S JUST COMPLETELY AMAZING 
HERE I AM AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD 
I'M STILL THINKING ABOUT IT 
THAT MOMENT OF PUTTING THE FLAG IN THE GROUND I DID IT 
WOW THAT WAS IT 
YOU CAN'T DO BETTER THAN THAT 
IT WAS SUCH A BRILLIANT EXPERIENCE 
TRULY A ONCE IN A LIFETIME DREAM COME TRUE 
IT'S MADE ME THINK ABOUT MY DAD WHO PASSED AWAY A FEW YEARS AGO 
I'M SURE HE'S WITH ME AND IS PROUD OF ME 
AND I DID IT FOR HIM MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND EVERYONE 
I HAVE VERY MIXED EMOTIONS 
IT WAS DEFINITELY WORTH IT THOUGH 
I'M VERY EXCITED 
I'M GOING TO TRY AND GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP TRY 
MY HEAD'S FULL OF ALL THESE THOUGHTS ANYWAY GOOD NIGHT 
IT'S COLD 
WE CAMPED HERE FOR THE NEXT TWO NIGHTS 
WHILE WE WAITED FOR THE HELICOPTER TO COME AND PICK US UP 
WE HAD NOTHING TO DO SO WE JUST HAD SOME FUN 
THIS IS A RUSSIAN HELICOPTER FROM ICE STATION BARNEO 
IT FLIES ALL SORTS OF EXPEDITION GROUPS AROUND THE NORTH POLE 
THAT'S IT THERE 
WE'RE AT NINETY DEGREES NORTH HAVING FINISHED OUR TREK 
SO IT'S PICKING US UP TO TAKE US BACK HOME 
IT'S SAD TO THINK OUR TIME HAS COME TO AN END HERE 
AT THE BEAUTIFUL NORTH POLE 
BACK AT ICE STATION BARNEO WE MET UP WITH THE OTHER TWO GROUPS 
NEITHER HAD MADE IT TO THE NORTH POLE 
AND I REALISED HOW LUCKY WE WERE 
IT HAPPENED OVER A COUPLE OF DAYS BASICALLY 
YOU KNOW HAVING TO WORK WITH THE TENT POLES IN THE MORNING 
ALSO HAVING TO TAKE YOUR GLOVES OFF WHEN YOU'RE MESSING WITH YOUR SKIS 
SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY WHERE IT'S GONE WRONG 
SO IF YOU THINK THE NORTH POLE ISN'T COLD TAKE NOTE 
IT'S SUCH A NICE SURPRISE TO SEE SO MANY OF MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS HERE 
I FEEL VERY EMOTIONAL 
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THE EXPEDITION WAS A TERRIFIC SUCCESS 
COMMUNICATION WISE IT WAS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD 
ALTHOUGH WE'D LEARNED ABOUT FORTY PHRASES 
I THINK WE PROBABLY ONLY NEEDED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN OF THEM 
A LOT OF THE TIME YOU COULD JUST SORT OF SAY COPY ME 
FOLLOW MY TRACKS OR WHATEVER ELSE 
AND IN THE TENT WHEN PACE WAS A BIT SLOWER 
YOU COULD COMMUNICATE BY LIPREADING AND FINGERSPELLING 
WHICH WE ALL GOT FAIRLY PROFICIENT AT 
THAT'S IAN THERE HE HAS SOME HEARING 
HE WAS ONE OF OUR TEAM AND DID SOME INTERPRETING FOR ME 
IT WAS BASIC BUT SO SO USEFUL TO ME 
WHEN I WAS A BIT LOST HE HELPED ME A GREAT DEAL 
WE WERE A LITTLE BIT SAD WHEN THE HELICOPTER ARRIVED TO COLLECT US 
BECAUSE WE KNEW WE'D BE LEAVING THAT PLACE FOREVER 
I'M HAPPY I'M HAPPY I'VE MADE THE HISTORY BOOKS 
MORE MINUS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
TWO HUNDRED FIVE SOLD 
I'M THE FIRST PERSON TO SHAVE OLIVER'S BEARD IN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS 
BYE BEARD 
SEE YOU IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
OLIVER'S BACK 
MY BEARD OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IS NO MORE REST IN PEACE 
A MINUTE'S SILENCE PLEASE 
THAT NIGHT I RAISED ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED 
WHICH BRINGS MY GRAND TOTAL TO TWENTY SIX THOUSAND 
ANOTHER ONE THOUSAND AND I'LL HAVE REACHED MY TARGET 
IT FEELS VERY STRANGE AFTER TWO YEARS OF NON STOP FUNDRAISING 
IT ALREADY FEELS DIFFERENT 
I'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE A REST NOW 
BUT I AM GOING TO PLAN ANOTHER CHALLENGE 
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT 
IT COULD BE THE MOON IT COULD BE MOUNT EVEREST ANYTHING 
I'VE GOT AN IDEA BUT YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE
