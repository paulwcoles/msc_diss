THIS IS TIBET IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
A BEAUTIFUL ISOLATED LAND HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS OF THE HIMALAYAS 
SURROUNDED BY THE EMPIRES OF BRITAIN AND CHINA 
AND YET STILL ALMOST COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED BY THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
TIBET IS NOW MOST FAMOUS FOR ITS LEADER THE DALAI LAMA 
WHO WAS FORCED INTO EXILE NEARLY FIFTY YEARS AGO 
OH FATHER MY FATHER 
TIBET AS WE SEE IT IN THESE FILMS HAS BEEN COMPLETELY LOST 
THIS TREASURE TROVE OF RARE COLOUR FILMS SHOT BY BRITISH CHINESE 
AND TIBETAN PEOPLE WHO LIVED THROUGH THESE TIMES 
HAVE BEEN PRESERVED BY THE BRITISH FILM INSTITUTE 
THESE FILMS ALLOW US A GLIMPSE INTO A WORLD WHICH HAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED 
TO A TIME BEFORE THE DALAI LAMA AND HIS PEOPLE LOST THEIR COUNTRY 
IT'S NOW IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL THE STORY OF TIBET IN TIBET BECAUSE SINCE THE CHINESE INVASION OF NINETEEN FIFTY 
IT'S BECOME A CRIMINAL OFFENCE TO EVEN DISCUSS TIBETAN INDEPENDENCE IN TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY CHINA 
SO TO TELL THE TALE OF THE LOST WORLD OF TIBET I'VE HAD TO COME TO ANOTHER COUNTRY I'VE COME TO INDIA 
THE DALAI LAMA ESCAPED HERE IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE 
AND ALONG WITH THE TIBETAN GOVERNMENT IN EXILE 
IS BASED HERE IN THE MCLEOD GANGE 
TO UNDERSTAND HOW TIBET WAS LOST WHY THE DALAI LAMA MUST LIVE 
IN EXILE YOU HAVE TO LOOK BACK TO A TIME WHEN TIBET WAS A FREE NATION 
THIS IS LHASA THE CAPITAL OF TIBET IN THE EARLY NINETEEN FORTIES 
THIS FILM WAS OF THE MAIN SHOPPING STREET KNOWN AS THE BARKHOR 
DESPITE BEING SHOT IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IT LOOKS MEDIEVAL 
HARDLY SURPRISING GIVEN TIBET'S LOCATION 
IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH SO IT REMAINED FROZEN IN TIME 
NAMGYAL TAKLA LIVED IN TIBET IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES 
WE HAD THE HUGE MOUNTAINS SURROUNDING TIBET 
AND THEN WE WERE INSIDE THIS MOUNTAIN ISOLATED 
AND WE HAD THE BIG 
RUSSIA CHINA BRITAIN AROUND US 
AND IT WAS THE POLICY TO BE 
THIS COUNTRY TO BE KEPT ABOVE A STATE SORT OF A ZONE WHERE THE BIG POWERS WILL NOT MEET 
AND IT WAS WE LIVED IN 
IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WE MAYBE HAVE LIVED LIKE WE WERE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
TIBETAN SOCIETY WAS BOTH FEUDAL AND DEEPLY RELIGIOUS 
BUDDHISM HAD A PROFOUND EFFECT IN SHAPING ITS CULTURE AND TRADITIONS 
RULED BY A DUAL SYSTEM OF ARISTOCRATIC FAMILIES AND BUDDHIST MONKS 
THE GOVERNMENT'S MAIN FUNCTION WAS TO MAINTAIN THE RELIGIOUS STATE 
TIBET'S FEUDAL STRUCTURE MEANT THAT MOST OF THE POPULATION LIVED IN POVERTY 
ANY ATTEMPTS TO MODERNISE OR INVITE FOREIGN INFLUENCE WERE RESISTED 
BY THEIR CONSERVATIVE AND PROFOUNDLY RELIGIOUS OUTLOOK 
LIFE IN LHASA WAS DOMINATED BY A HUGE NUMBER OF RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS 
WHICH INVOLVED MOST OF THE CITY'S POPULATION 
SIXTY EIGHT DAYS OF THE YEAR WERE TAKEN UP WITH FESTIVALS 
SINCE THE CHINESE OCCUPATION OF TIBET 
ALL OF THESE FESTIVALS HAVE BEEN BANNED 
EVEN THOUGH LIFE FOR EXILED TIBETANS HAS CHANGED ENORMOUSLY 
SINCE THE CHINESE INVASION 
TIBETAN SOCIETY IS STILL DEEPLY RELIGIOUS AND BUDDHISM IS CENTRAL TO ITS CULTURE 
BUDDHISM ARRIVED IN TIBET IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY AD 
ABOUT ONE THOUSAND YEARS AFTER IT STARTED IN NORTHERN INDIA 
FOCUSING ON SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT ALL BUDDHISTS BELIEVE THAT THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT 
LIES THROUGH THE PRACTICE AND DEVELOPMENT OF MORALITY MEDITATION AND WISDOM 
AT THE TIME THESE FILMS WERE MADE MONKS MADE UP TWENTY PER CENT OF THE MALE TIBETAN POPULATION 
EVERY TIBETAN FAMILY RICH OR POOR SENT THEIR YOUNGEST SON 
TO A MONASTERY AS A SPIRITUAL AND RELIGIOUS DUTY 
BECAUSE MONKS HAD A HIGH SOCIAL STATUS 
POOR FAMILIES GAVE UP THEIR BOYS IN THE CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE THEY WOULD BE LOOKED AFTER FINANCIALLY FOR LIFE 
THESE BOYS WOULD JUST HAVE ARRIVED AT THE MONASTERY 
EVEN THOUGH IN THEORY THEY COULD GIVE UP BEING A MONK IF THEY WANTED 
THEY WOULD EXPECT TO STAY THERE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES 
THE PRESENT DALAI LAMA WHO'S THE FOURTEENTH WAS FOUND WHILE HE WAS STILL A SMALL CHILD 
IN A TRADITION THAT DATES BACK TO THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THE DALAI LAMA 
OR OCEAN OF WISDOM IS BOTH THE SPIRITUAL AND SECULAR LEADER OF TIBET 
ALL BUDDHISTS BELIEVE IN REBIRTH AND REINCARNATION BUT FOR TIBETAN BUDDHISTS 
THE MAN THEY CALL HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA IS VERY SPECIAL INDEED 
SOME SEE HIM AS A MAN GOD 
ALL BELIEVE HE'S A REINCARNATION OF ALL THIRTEEN PREVIOUS DALAI LAMAS 
AND HE'S A BODHISATTVA OF COMPASSION AN ENLIGHTENED BEING 
WHO HAS CHOSEN REBIRTH AS A HUMAN BEING SO HE CAN BE ON THIS WORLD TO HELP OTHERS 
WHEN THE THIRTEENTH DALAI LAMA DIED HIS REINCARNATION A THREE YEAR OLD BOY 
CALLED TENZIN GYATSO WAS FOUND SOME SIX HUNDRED MILES FROM THE CAPITAL IN AMDO 
A PROVINCE IN THE FAR NORTH EAST 
WHILE THE WESTERN WORLD WAS AT WAR THE FAMILY MADE THE LONG JOURNEY TO THE CAPITAL LHASA 
THE FOURTEENTH DALAI LAMA ARRIVED IN OCTOBER NINETEEN FORTY 
BY NOW HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD 
HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND TWO ELDER BROTHERS 
LOBSANG SAMTEN AND GYALO THONDUP 
OH FATHER MY FATHER 
FATHER YES 
AND MY MOTHER 
THIS IS ELDER BROTHER WHOM I BULLY 
MY MOTHER VERY VERY GENTLE 
ALMOST I NEVER SAW HER SORT OF 
IN A MENTAL STATE OF TEMPER I NEVER SAW VERY GENTLE 
ALWAYS SMILE 
SOMEBODY VERY NICE VERY NICE WOMAN 
A VILLAGER UNEDUCATED 
AT THE BEGINNING ILLITERATE 
LATER WITH HER OWN EFFORT SHE CAN READ 
SOME BOOKS 
NOW HERE YES MY FATHER WITH MOUSTACHE 
HE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN KEEPING HIS MOUSTACHE 
VERY ORGANISED WAY 
NOT LIKE THAT 
SO HE USED OF COURSE OUR FAMILY FROM TIME TO TIME EATING MEAT 
WITH BONE 
SO EVERY TIME 
FROM THE BONE 
THERE'S SOMETHING WHAT DO WE CALL IT MARROW OR SOMETHING 
SO HE USED TO PUT IT ON HIS MOUSTACHE 
AND DO LIKE THAT 
ALTHOUGH THE YOUNG DALAI LAMA WAS REVERED AS A GOD KING 
HE WOULD NOT TAKE UP HIS POSITION AS HEAD OF STATE UNTIL HE REACHED EIGHTEEN 
YEARS OF MONASTIC STUDY LAY AHEAD OF HIM 
BUDDHISM INVOLVES TRAINING TRANSFORMING THE MIND 
SO AS TO HAVE A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRUE NATURE OF EXISTENCE 
TO GAIN HAPPINESS AND ULTIMATELY TO ACHIEVE SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT 
BUDDHISTS BELIEVE IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE TO ESCAPE SUFFERING 
TO FIND TRUE HAPPINESS BY GIVING UP ALL WORLDLY DESIRES 
AND BY ACCEPTING THE TRANSITORY NATURE OF LIFE 
ALL THINGS CHANGE COME TO AN END DON'T TRY TO HANG ON TO THINGS 
ALSO ONE HAS TO UNDERSTAND THAT ALL ONE'S ACTIONS ONE'S KARMA 
HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR GOOD OR FOR ILL 
IF YOU DO GOOD THINGS THEN YOU GET MERIT AND I SUPPOSE HURTLE TOWARDS YOUR OWN ENLIGHTENMENT 
BUT MORE TO THE POINT DO GOOD THINGS AND THE WORLD BENEFITS 
YOU PUT POSITIVE ENERGY OUT INTO THE WORLD 
THE EVENTS OF BUDDHA'S LIFE AND TEACHINGS WERE CELEBRATED 
THROUGH CEREMONIES AND RITUALS THAT DOMINATED LIFE IN TIBET 
THE MONLAM CHENMO OR GREAT PRAYER FESTIVAL IS A SERIES OF EVENTS 
WHICH COMMEMORATES THE DAY WHEN BUDDHA PREACHED THE DHARMA OR SACRED TEXT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THE FESTIVAL STARTS WHEN THE MONKS TAKE OVER THE RUNNING OF LHASA FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
THE PROCTORS OF THE DREPUNG MONASTERY ARRIVE CARRYING HEAVY SILVER MACES 
TO DEMAND THAT POWER IS HANDED OVER TO THEM BY THE KASHAG OR PARLIAMENT 
THEIR ATTENDANTS CEREMONIALLY THROW DOWN THE WHIPS OF THE CITY MAGISTRATES 
AND BOW TO THE PROCTORS TO FORMALISE THE HANDOVER 
THE PROCTORS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOB DOBS OR MONASTIC POLICE 
HUGE MONKS WHO CARRIED LONG STICKS AND WHIPS 
WEARING PADDED ROBES THEIR JOB IS TO INTIMIDATE AND CONTROL 
THE CROWD OF TWENTY THOUSAND MONKS WHO FLOOD THE CITY FOR THE FESTIVAL 
FOR THE NEXT MONTH THE PROCTORS ARE ABLE TO IMPOSE FINES ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC 
FOR HAVING A DIRTY HOUSE FOR USING BELLS ON A HORSE OR MULE 
FOR WOMEN NOT WEARING A HEADDRESS FOR THE WEARING OF FOREIGN SHOES 
OR ANY OTHER DISORDERLY BEHAVIOUR 
GIFTS OF MONEY AND FOOD WERE HANDED OUT 
WHILE THE EVENT WAS MOSTLY FUNDED BY THE GOVERNMENT 
THERE WERE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE BRITISH AND CHINESE TRADE MISSIONS BASED IN LHASA 
AT THIS TIME THE CHINESE WERE HAPPY TO SUPPORT RELIGIOUS EVENTS 
THE TIBETAN GOVERNMENT WAS DOMINATED BY A GROUP OF ARISTOCRATIC FAMILIES 
THERE WERE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FAMILIES WHO MADE UP THE CIVIL SERVICE 
AND EACH OF THEM HAD TO PROVIDE A SON TO SERVE AS AN OFFICIAL 
WITHIN THE ARISTOCRACY THERE WERE THIRTY HIGHER STATUS FAMILIES WHO HAD THE MOST SENIOR POSITIONS 
NAMGYAL IS FROM ONE OF THESE FAMILIES THE TSARONGS 
OH THAT'S OUR HOUSE 
THE HOUSE I WAS BORN IN 
IT'S OUR OWN HOUSE AND THAT'S MY AUNT KUKULA 
AND THAT'S MY MOTHER THEY'RE REALLY MODELLING AWAY 
IT SEEMS QUITE STRANGE THAT THEY'RE MODELLING 
BECAUSE WE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THIS IN TIBET 
NOR DID ANYBODY DO THAT IT SEEMS QUITE STRANGE 
I'M SURE AUNTIE KUKULA MUST HAVE ARRANGED THIS 
I THINK THEY HAD A BRITISH GOVERNESS 
SO SHE MUST HAVE TAUGHT MY MOTHER HOW TO WALK 
THEY'RE WEARING THE CEREMONIAL COSTUMES 
KUKULA'S CONSIDERED VERY BEAUTIFUL AND SHE'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL HERE 
I MUST SAY AND YOU NOTICE HERE 
OH THIS IS ALSO IN OUR GARDEN 
WE HAD ONE OF THE BEST GARDENS ALSO IN LHASA 
BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER HIMSELF HE WORKED IN THE GARDEN 
AND ALSO HE MADE ALL THE FAMILY MEMBERS COME AND WORK 
AND WE EACH CHILD HAD A TREE 
WE HAD TO WATER THE TREE FERTILISE IT AND WE WERE ONLY ALLOWED 
TO TAKE THE FRUIT OFF THAT TREE AND NO FRUIT FROM THE OTHER TREES 
SO WE HAD STRAWBERRIES AND GOOSEBERRIES PEARS EVERYTHING 
IN THIS PICTURE YOU SEE MY AUNTS TOGETHER WITH THEIR GRANDFATHER 
THEY HAD THE SAME FATHER TSARONG BUT THEY HAD THREE DIFFERENT MOTHERS 
THEY WERE THREE SISTERS FROM THE ORIGINAL TSARONG FAMILY 
THIS SORT OF FAMILY STRUCTURE WAS NOT UNUSUAL IN TIBET 
MEN COULD MARRY A NUMBER OF WOMEN 
AND EVEN WOMEN COULD MARRY A NUMBER OF MEN 
THE REASON IS TO KEEP THE FAMILY WEALTH TOGETHER 
MARRIED OUT THE BROTHERS HAD SEVERAL WIVES THERE ARE BOUND TO BE TROUBLES 
AND THEN THEY MIGHT SAY O. K. WE WANT TO SEPARATE THE LAND 
SO THEY USUALLY HAD BROTHERS MARRYING ONE DAUGHTER 
OR THE DAUGHTERS MARRYING SEVERAL BROTHERS IT WAS VERY COMMON 
DIVORCE DID EXIST AND USUALLY WHAT HAPPENED WAS 
DURING MARRIAGE THERE'S A CONTRACT MADE AND THEN 
USUALLY MOST OF THE DIVORCES 
THE WIFE WOULD BE WELL LOOKED AFTER WHEN SHE LEAVES THE HOME 
IF THERE'S A SON THE SON STAYS WITH THE FATHER AND THE DAUGHTER STAYS WITH THE MOTHER 
THERE'S NO CUSTODY OF CHILDREN FIGHTING ABOUT IT 
AUTOMATICALLY THE DAUGHTER GOES TO THE MOTHER THE SON GOES TO THE FATHER THEY COULD ALSO REMARRY 
WE HAD NO PROBLEMS ABOUT DIVORCEES OR WIDOWS REMARRYING 
IN FACT IF THEY WERE YOUNG THEY WERE ENCOURAGED TO MARRY 
THIS MASSIVE CIVIL AND MONASTIC BUREAUCRACY WITHIN LHASA 
WAS ABOUT TO BE LED SPIRITUALLY IF NOT POLITICALLY 
BY THE FIVE YEAR OLD DALAI LAMA 
BEFORE HIS OFFICIAL ENTHRONEMENT 
HE STAYED AT THE SUMMER PALACE THE NORBULINGKA 
AT FIRST HIS FAMILY WERE ALSO ALLOWED TO STAY THERE TOO 
BEFORE HE BEGAN HIS NEW LIFE 
OF COURSE AT THAT TIME MY MOTHER MY FATHER AND MY ELDER BROTHER 
REMAINED OR STAYED WITH ME 
THEN MOTHER AND FATHER 
I THINK EVERY DAY THEY CAME TO SEE ME 
AND ALSO I VISITED TO THEIR HOME 
I ENJOY MY NATIVE VILLAGE'S FOOD 
WHILE PILGRIMS CAME FROM ALL OVER TIBET FOREIGN DIGNITARIES ALSO PAID HOMAGE TO THE GOD KING 
THE BRITISH POLITICAL OFFICER IN NEARBY SIKKIM 
BROUGHT A MOVIE CAMERA WITH HIM AND MANAGED TO GET 
THIS FIRST EVER MOVING PICTURE OF THE DALAI LAMA 
SIR BASIL GOULD SEEN HERE WITH THE WHITE PRAYER SCARF AROUND HIS NECK 
ALSO BOUGHT AN EXPENSIVE FOREIGN TOY CAR FOR THE LITTLE BOY 
BUT ALREADY HIS STATUS SET HIM APART FROM OTHER CHILDREN 
AND ONLY THE OLDER BROTHER LOBSANG WAS ALLOWED TO TEST DRIVE IT 
THIS IS MY BROTHER ELDER BROTHER 
SO THE PEOPLE FELT 
IF I HANDLE IT MAY BE TOO RISKY 
SO MY ELDER BROTHER LET HIM PLAY 
SOMETIMES I FEEL JEALOUSY 
SOMEBODY IS IN THE CAR 
I WONDER IF THAT IS MY HUSBAND 
IT'S HIM 
NAMGYAL MARRIED THE DALAI LAMA'S OLDER BROTHER LOBSANG IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO 
THERE'S LOBSANG ON THE HORSE NOW I SEE HIM 
HE'S SO SERIOUS I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SERIOUS HE IS THERE 
HE'S NOT A SERIOUS PERSON BUT THERE HE LOOKS SO SERIOUS 
NOW THAT'S A VERY NICE PICTURE YES OF LOBSANG'S FATHER 
WITH HIS MOTHER GOING IN FRONT OF HIM 
THE DATE FOR THE FOURTEENTH DALAI LAMA'S ENTHRONEMENT CEREMONY AT THE POTALA PALACE 
WAS REACHED ACCORDING TO COMPLEX ASTROLOGICAL CALCULATIONS 
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE NORBULINGKA PALACE AND THE POTALA IS ONLY A FEW MILES 
THE DALAI LAMA WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED ON THE SHORT JOURNEY BY THE WHOLE OF HIS MONASTIC AND CIVIL RETINUE 
THE THIRTEEN STOREY POTALA WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY 
IT'S A QUARTER OF A MILE LONG WITH OVER ONE THOUSAND ROOMS 
IT WAS A WINTER RESIDENCE OF THE DALAI LAMA 
A CENTRE FOR RELIGIOUS WORSHIP AND TRAINING 
AS WELL AS HOUSING TIBET'S GOVERNMENT AND HUGE CIVIL SERVICE 
TENZIN GYATSO WAS ENTHRONED 
AS THE FOURTEENTH DALAI LAMA ON TWENTY SECOND FEBRUARY NINETEEN FORTY 
A LIFE OF AUSTERITY AND STRICT SCHOLARLY PURSUIT 
BEGAN FOR THE FIVE YEAR OLD AND HIS BROTHER LOBSANG 
I THINK FOR HIM BEING A NORMAL CHILD AND THEN SUDDENLY 
BECOMING A MONK AND THEN COMING UP TO LHASA WITH HIS HOLINESS 
AND LEAVING THE PARENTS AND THEN SUDDENLY GOING INTO THIS HUGE POTALA PALACE AND LIVING THERE 
AMIDST THE OLDER MONKS WHO CAN BE QUITE STRICT 
AND HE USED TO OFTEN TELL ME IT WAS NOT THAT PLEASANT THERE 
THE ELDER BROTHER STAYED WITH ME WE ALWAYS PLAY 
AND SOMETIMES I BULLY HIM 
ALTHOUGH HE'S OLDER THAN ME 
HE USED TO TALK ABOUT HIS HOLINESS BEING QUITE NAUGHTY AND MISCHIEVOUS 
AND THEN WHEN HE WAS NAUGHTY HIS TUTORS USED TO FRIGHTEN LOBSANG 
AND THEN HE SAID HIS HOLINESS USED TO GET INTO A LOT OF VERY NICE GAMES 
RUNNING AROUND AND THEN FEEDING THE BIRDS OUTSIDE ON THE ROOF 
THAT WAS THE GREATEST FUN 
HERE WERE THESE TWO LITTLE BOYS WITH THE OLDER 
ATTENDANTS AND HUGE DARK ROOMS 
AND IT WAS VERY FRIGHTENING FOR THEM 
COMING FROM A VILLAGE WHERE YOU HAD A LOT OF RUNNING AROUND FREEDOM 
AND THEN SUDDENLY UP THERE IT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE INTIMIDATING FOR HIM 
SO THEN I CAN GO ONCE A MONTH 
MY MOTHER CAME 
SO WHEN MY MOTHER CAME I FEEL VERY HAPPY 
WHEN MY MOTHER DEPARTS I FEEL A LITTLE 
LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE LITTLE SAD 
TIBETAN BUDDHISM DIFFERS FROM OTHER TYPES BECAUSE AT ITS ROOTS 
IN THE TRADITIONS OF THE EARLIER BON RELIGION 
THEREFORE THERE'S A BELIEF IN GODS AND CELESTIAL BEINGS 
BUT ALSO THERE ARE VARIOUS TRADITIONS THAT INVOLVE 
ALL TIBETAN SOCIETY IN THE PRACTICE OF BUDDHISM 
TIBETANS BELIEVE THAT THEIR PRAYERS CAN BE GIVEN ADDED POWER 
BY BEING CONDUCTED BY MEANS OF A PRAYER WHEEL 
HERE IS A PRAYER WHEEL 
WALKING ROUND THE WHEEL MEANS THAT MY PRAYERS HAVE THE POWER 
OF THE WRITTEN PRAYERS INSIDE THIS WHEEL INCREDIBLE 
ALSO THE FLAGS HAVE A SIMILAR THING 
PRAYERS THROUGH REPETITION AND THE MANTRAS 
ARE USED TO REALLY GAIN MERIT 
AND HELP ONE ON ONE'S PATH TO ENLIGHTENMENT 
PRAYER WHEELS CAN CONTAIN UP TO A MILE OF WRITTEN PRAYERS 
THEY'RE SYMBOLICALLY RECITED WITH EVERY TURN 
PILGRIMS EARN MERIT AND CONCENTRATE THEIR MINDS ON THE MANTRAS 
THEY'RE RECITING AS THE WHEEL TURNS 
THE CIRCULAR FIVE MILE WALK WHICH SURROUNDED LHASA WAS KNOWN AS THE LINKHOR 
ON THE FESTIVAL DAYS PILGRIMS WOULD START WALKING EARLY IN THE MORNING 
ARTEMESIA SCRUB RHODODENDRON AND JUNIPER TWIGS 
WERE BURNT AND THE AIR WOULD BE FILLED WITH INCENSE 
A NEW LINKHOR'S BEEN CREATED AT MCLEOD GANGE 
IT SURROUNDS THE DALAI LAMA'S OWN RESIDENCE UP THERE 
THIS REPLACES THE SACRED PATH LOST AT LHASA 
PILGRIMS NOW WALK IT 
THIS IS A PARTICULARLY DAY IT'S A FESTIVAL DAY 
THESE DAYS AS I SAY THEY JUST WALK 
BUT IN THE PAST PILGRIMS WOULD PROSTRATE THEMSELVES ALONG THE ROUTE 
AND THAT WAS DONE RATHER LIKE THIS 
ONE SIMPLY STOPS SAYS A PRAYER 
AND THEN ONE MEASURES ONE'S LENGTH ON THE GROUND RIGHT THE WAY DOWN 
TO THE BOTTOM AND UP AGAIN 
AND SO ONE GOES RIGHT AROUND THE PATH 
I PUT MY FEET WHERE MY HEAD WAS AND DOWN I GO AGAIN 
A DIFFICULT PROCESS BUT IT WAS TO SHOW RESPECT AND COMPASSION 
FOR ALL THINKING BEINGS TO REMOVE NEGATIVE FORCES 
AND TO GAIN MERIT TO HELP ONE ALONG ONE'S PATH TO ENLIGHTENMENT 
JAMPA CHODEN WAS A YOUNG NUN LIVING IN LHASA AT THE TIME 
DOWN HERE THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE DOING SIDEWAYS PROSTRATIONS 
AS WELL AS THE FORWARD PROSTRATIONS 
I DID A LINKHOR CIRCUIT 
I TOOK SIX DAYS IN MOURNING 
I DIDN'T MANAGE TO DO ANY SIDEWAYS PROSTRATIONS 
BUT I MANAGED TO DO ONE CIRCUIT DOING THE FORWARD PROSTRATIONS 
HERE THEY'RE MAKING THE DESCENT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE PROSTRATING 
HERE YOU'D NEARLY FALL DOWN THE HILL 
IN THE AFTERNOON DURING THE MIDDAY SUN 
YOU COULDN'T DO THE PROSTRATIONS YOU COULD HAVE A REST 
FRIENDS WOULD BRING YOU MEALS SO YOU'D HAVE A LUNCH BREAK 
JAMPA SULTRAN AND TENZIN CHONI TARA ALSO DID THE LINKHOR CIRCUIT 
SO AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY 
IT TURNS OUT THAT WE BOTH HAPPEN TO HAVE DONE 
THE FULL BODY LENGTH PROSTRATIONS AND MADE THE WHOLE CIRCUIT 
IT WOULD VARY HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO DO 
THE FULL BODY LENGTH PROSTRATIONS DEPENDING ON THE INDIVIDUAL 
THE FAST ONES WOULD DO IT IN THREE TO FOUR DAYS 
OTHERS MIGHT DO IT IN SHORT STAGES 
SO IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT SEVEN TO EIGHT DAYS TO DO THE FULL CIRCUIT 
WHEREVER YOU ENDED THE DAY YOU'D LEAVE A MARK 
AND THEN YOU'D RESUME FROM THERE THE NEXT DAY 
HE SAID YESTERDAY HE DID IT IN FOUR DAYS 
THE REASON FOR DOING THE PROSTRATIONS 
IS TO ACCUMULATE MERIT AND TO CLEANSE YOURSELF OF YOUR NEGATIVITIES 
IT'S AN ENTIRELY SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY 
ON FESTIVAL DAYS THE CABINET AND SENIOR CIVIL OFFICIALS 
ALSO WALKED THE LINKHOR 
BUT THEY WOULD GET VERY HOT IN THEIR HEAVY CEREMONIAL COSTUMES 
AND SO WOULD STOP OFF AT THE BRITISH MISSION FOR A CUP OF TEA 
HISTORICALLY THE BRITISH AND CHINESE WERE OFFICIALLY REPRESENTED IN TIBET 
BRITISH PRESSURE TO ALLOW TRADING HAD LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW BRITISH TRADE MISSION IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN 
AND IN THE MID NINETEEN FORTIES A CHINESE REPRESENTATIVE ARRIVED IN LHASA 
RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH WERE CORDIAL WHILE THEY WERE MORE TENSE WITH THE CHINESE 
DOCTOR SUM LYEN CHEN 
SEEN HERE BEING WELCOMED BY THE TIBETAN FINANCE MINISTER 
WAS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CHINESE NATIONALIST GOVERNMENT 
AT HOME CHINA WAS IN THE MIDST OF A BLOODY CIVIL WAR BETWEEN THE NATIONALISTS AND COMMUNISTS 
LIFE IN LHASA CONTINUED ACCORDING TO ANCIENT CUSTOM AND PRACTICE 
THE DALAI LAMA LIVED IN THE POTALA DURING THE WINTER AND THE NORBULINGKA DURING THE SUMMER 
TWICE A YEAR THE CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS HIERARCHY ACCOMPANIED HIM ON HIS MOVE FROM PALACE TO PALACE 
IDENTIFIED BY THE PEACOCK FEATHERED UMBRELLA 
WHICH ACCOMPANIED HIS SEDAN CHAIR 
THE WHOLE POPULATION OF LHASA WATCHED SILENTLY FOR A GLIMPSE OF HIS HOLINESS 
OH THAT YOUNG MONK 
I THINK OUT OF CURIOSITY LOOKING 
IN ANY CASE FROM MY CHILDHOOD FROM THAT AGE 
I WANTED TO SMILE WITH PEOPLE WITH PUBLIC 
SO PEOPLE ALSO THEY LOVE MY SMILE 
SO WHENEVER I LOOK LIKE THAT THE PEOPLE EXPRESS SOME KIND OF 
EXPRESSION OF OVERJOYOUS 
I THINK AROUND FROM TEN YEARS OLD AROUND TEN 
WHEN I LOOK THIS I FEEL THE PEOPLE CONSIDER THE REINCARNATION OF DALAI LAMA 
BUT ACTUALLY THAT YOUNG BOY I THINK THINK ONLY PLAY HOW TO PLAY 
SO THERE'S A BIG CONTRAST 
THE TIBETAN YEAR'S MARKED BY MANY RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS 
HERE IN THE DALAI LAMA'S OWN MONASTERY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE GATHER TO CELEBRATE NEW YEAR 
IT TAKES PLACE IN LATE FEBRUARY EARLY MARCH 
BUT SADLY FAR FEWER FESTIVALS ARE CELEBRATED NOW THAN THEY WERE IN TIBET 
THE KING'S NEW YEAR FESTIVAL 
CELEBRATES THE DALAI LAMA'S POSITION AS A RULER OF BOTH CHURCH AND STATE 
THE HIGH OFFICIALS WEAR ROBES WHOSE DESIGN DATES BACK TO THE SEVENTH CENTURY 
ALONG WITH ANCIENT ORNAMENTS OF AMBER AND CORAL 
WHICH HAVE BEEN TRADED ALONG THE SILK ROUTE AND HAD ORIGINALLY COME FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN 
THE TURQUOISE CHARM BOXES AROUND THEIR NECKS 
AND THE GOLDEN BAR ENCASED IN TURQUOISE 
WHICH REACHES THEIR WAIST IS SO HEAVY IT MUST BE CARRIED 
THE ORDINARY PEOPLE OF LHASA GATHER AT THE FOOT OF THE POTALA 
TO WATCH THE SKY DANCING 
A SPECTACLE IN WHICH A MAN SCALES A ROPE UP TO A TALL WOODEN MAST 
STANDS PRECARIOUSLY ON A SMALL PLATFORM AND THEN SPINS HIMSELF AROUND 
THE PERFORMANCE TRADITIONALLY A MAN FROM ONE OF THE SMALL VILLAGES IN THE REGION OF TSANG 
IS DONE IN RETRIBUTION FOR THEIR RESISTANCE TO THE RULE OF THE FIFTH DALAI LAMA 
THERE'S A SAYING IN TSANG MOTHERS DON'T DIE FROM ILLNESSES 
BUT FROM WORRY THAT THEIR SONS MIGHT BE TAKEN FOR THE SKY DANCE 
THE CASTING OUT OF THE VOTIVE OFFERING WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST ELABORATE OF THE CELEBRATIONS 
THIS CEREMONIAL MILITARY MANOEUVRE WAS KNOWN AS THE COILING SNAKE 
WITH CIVIL OFFICIALS ACTING AS MARSHALS FIVE HUNDRED INFANTRY IN CHAINMAIL 
MOVE IN A ZIGZAG FORMATION WHILE ANOTHER FORMATION CIRCLES IT 
SEEMINGLY CHAOTIC IT WAS HIGHLY ORGANISED AND THE TROOPS REHEARSED FOR MONTHS TO PERFECT IT 
HUNDREDS OF MONKS ARRIVE CARRYING GREEN DRUMS AND CYMBALS 
NEXT THE TORMA ARE BROUGHT OUT TALL SCULPTURES 
WHICH HAVE A GRINNING SKULL ON TOP AND REPRESENT ALL EVIL SPIRITS 
WEARING AN ORNATE HEADDRESS THE NECHUNG ORACLE 
A MONK WHO IS CHOSEN FOR HIS PSYCHIC POWERS 
APPEARS IN A STATE OF POSSESSION 
THE ORACLE'S HELMET AND COSTUME ARE SO HEAVY THAT THE MEDIUM CAN HARDLY WALK IN THEM 
AT LEAST NOT IN A TRANCE LIKE STATE 
HE RACES AROUND CHAOTICALLY CHASING THE TORMAS INTO A CLEARING 
ACCOMPANIED BY HUNDREDS OF MONKS AND MOST OF THE POPULATION OF LHASA 
WHEN THE ORACLE ARRIVES HE SHOOTS A BURNING ARROW INTO BONFIRES 
WHICH CONTAIN THE EVIL SPIRITS AND THEY'RE SET ABLAZE 
THE WHOLE OF LHASA WAS DISTRACTED BY FESTIVALS OR CEREMONIES FOR NEARLY A QUARTER OF THE YEAR 
ONE OF THE DALAI LAMA'S FAVOURITE EVENTS 
WAS THE ANNUAL OPERA FESTIVAL HELD AT THE NORBULINGKA PALACE 
DURING SUMMER IN NORBULINGKA I THINK AROUND JULY AUGUST ON SUMMER FESTIVAL 
THE FOLK DANCE 
AND ALSO EVERY DAY 
THE MILITARY PERFORMANCE 
SO LIKE ANOTHER CHILD I LOVE THE MILITARY PERFORMANCE 
THEY WELL ORGANISED THEY QUITE SMART LIKE THAT 
OPERA TIBETAN OPERA 
IS A PLAY SO DURING THAT PERIOD I HAVE NO LESSON 
FREE HOLIDAY 
THEN MY MOTHER 
OFTEN COME BECAUSE DURING THAT PERIOD 
MY FAMILY STAY IN RESIDENCE IN NORBULINGKA 
THEY STAY THERE A FEW DAYS 
SO I VERY HAPPY 
THEN AFTER FIVE DAYS FESTIVAL FINISH 
THEN NEXT DAY MY LESSONS STARTED 
AND SAME TIME THIS IS THE FIFTH DAY EVENING MY MOTHER DEPART 
THAT'S THE CHILD'S SORT OF EXPERIENCE LIKE THAT 
MANY OF THE RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS HAD AN ADDITIONAL CIVIL OR GOVERNMENTAL ELEMENT 
AT THIS REVIEW 
THE TIBETAN CAVALRY ASSEMBLE IN FRONT OF THE CABINET AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
THE CAVALRY WEARS CHAINMAIL 
STEEL BREASTPLATES AND HELMETS WITH PEACOCK FEATHERS ON THEM 
THE STANDARD BEARERS WEAR SPECIAL HELMETS WHICH HAVE ALLAH 
INSCRIBED ON THEM IN GOLD THOUGHT TO DATE BACK TO EIGHTH CENTURY CONTACT WITH ARABS 
THEY CARRY TALL LANCES WRAPPED IN PAINTED BANNERS 
SAID TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY THE ARMY OF GENGHIS KHAN'S GRANDSON 
THE CABINET WEARS ORNATE ROBES THEIR FUR TRIMMED HATS 
HAVE SILK CROWNS WITH ORNAMENTS ON TOP OF CORAL TURQUOISE AND GOLD 
A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL FOLLOWED BY FOUR JUNIOR OFFICIALS MAKES HIS REPORT FOR CABINET 
ANNOUNCING THE NUMBER OF MEN AND HORSES 
THE CAVALRY THEN RIDE PAST THE CABINET IN CEREMONIAL STYLE 
FOR THE COMMONERS IN LHASA PARTICIPATION IN SOME FESTIVAL EVENTS 
WAS NOT REALLY A MATTER OF CHOICE 
FOR THE WRESTLING AND WEIGHTLIFTING 
THE CONTESTANTS WERE ALL FROM THE DALAI LAMA'S PERSONAL BODYGUARDS 
THOUGH IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE GIVEN THEIR SIZE AND STATURE 
THE WRESTLING WAS A PARTICULARLY UNPOPULAR DUTY AS THEY HAD TO WEAR LOINCLOTHS 
IT WAS DEEMED TO BE SHAMEFUL APPEARING SEMI NAKED IN PUBLIC 
ESPECIALLY IN FRONT OF YOUR SUPERIORS 
FOR MOST SHYNESS MEANT THEY WERE COVERED UP QUICKLY BUT SOME SEEMED TO RATHER ENJOY IT 
AT THE SAME TIME AS THE HORSE RACE IS BEING CONDUCTED AROUND THE CITY 
THERE'S ALSO A FOOT RACE 
A MOTLEY GROUP OF MEN RUN IN BRIGHTLY COLOURED OUTFITS SOMEWHAT UNENTHUSIASTICALLY 
THE RACE IS COMPULSORY AND IT'S PERFORMED AS A DUTY TO THEIR LANDLORDS 
FOR THE TIBETAN ARISTOCRATS THERE ARE LOTS OF SOCIAL EVENTS 
TO ATTEND AT THE BRITISH MISSION OR DEKYI LINGKA 
IN TRUE COLONIAL STYLE TEA WAS SERVED AND EVEN DARTS WERE PLAYED 
BUT THE BRITISH MISSION CLOSED WHEN INDIA GAINED INDEPENDENCE IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN 
TIBET STILL HAD NO STATUS AS AN INDEPENDENT NATION 
AND WAS NOT RECOGNISED INTERNATIONALLY 
THE CIVIL WAR BETWEEN THE COMMUNISTS AND NATIONALISTS IN CHINA CONTINUED 
THE TIBETAN GOVERNMENT REALISED THAT IF THE COMMUNISTS WON THEY WOULD NOT TOLERATE THEIR RELIGION 
HOWEVER THEY DID NOT WANT TO BE SEEN TO BE TAKING SIDES 
SO THEY POLITELY ASKED THE NATIONALIST CHINESE TO LEAVE TIBET 
THEY WERE SENT OFF WITH THE UTMOST COURTESY 
WITH PARTIES AND FREE TRANSPORT TO THE INDIAN BORDER 
THE SMALL TIBETAN ARMY WAS REORGANISED NEW REGIMENTS WERE FORMED AND THEY WERE RE EQUIPPED 
IN NINETEEN FORTY NINE THE CHINESE CIVIL WAR ENDED 
AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA WAS ESTABLISHED 
UNDER MAO TSE TUNG'S CHAIRMANSHIP 
ONE OF THEIR FIRST OBJECTIVES WAS TO BRING TIBET BACK INTO WHAT THEY CALLED THE MOTHERLAND 
ON SIXTH OCTOBER NINETEEN FIFTY 
FORTY THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS OF THE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY INVADED TIBET 
AND THE SMALL TIBETAN ARMY WAS QUICKLY OVERWHELMED 
AND FORCED TO SURRENDER 
THE ISSUE OF THE INVASION WAS RAISED WITH THE UNITED NATIONS BUT NOTHING WAS DONE 
INDEED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DID SHAMEFULLY LITTLE TO HELP TIBET IN ITS PLIGHT 
SO THE TIBETANS HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE CHINESE 
TO DO THIS THEY NEEDED A SOLE RULER AND SO DALAI LAMA 
STILL WITH TWO YEARS OF TRAINING AHEAD OF HIM 
WAS RAPIDLY GIVEN THE POWER TO RULE IN TIBET 
INCREDIBLE THIS A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD BOY WAS SUDDENLY MADE 
THE TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL RULER OF TIBET 
THE TEENAGER ACTED QUICKLY AND SENT DELEGATIONS TO BRITAIN AND AMERICA 
BUT IT WAS THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR AND THEY REFUSED TO HELP 
THE CHINESE HOWEVER WERE HAPPY TO TALK 
FEARFUL THAT CHINESE TROOPS WOULD INVADE LHASA 
THE DALAI LAMA INSTRUCTED TIBETAN OFFICIALS IN BEIJING TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS 
THE SEVENTEEN POINT AGREEMENT IN WHICH TIBET WAS DEFINED AS BEING PART OF THE CHINESE MOTHERLAND 
WAS SIGNED IN BEIJING WITHOUT THE DALAI LAMA'S CONSENT 
THE REUNIFICATION AS THE CHINESE CALLED IT WAS COMPLETED 
WHEN THE INVADING FORCES REACHED LHASA IN OCTOBER NINETEEN FIFTY ONE 
AND TIBET WAS CONQUERED 
RATHER THAN RESIST CHINESE RULE 
THE DALAI LAMA ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THE SEVENTEEN POINT AGREEMENT WORK 
AS IT WAS MEANT TO ALLOW THE TIBETAN GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE RUNNING ITS OWN COUNTRY 
FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS HE INTRODUCED SOCIAL AND LAND REFORMS 
ATTEMPTING TO PROPEL TIBET INTO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR DALAI LAMA RECEIVED AN INVITATION FROM THE CHINESE TO GO TO BEIJING 
MOST TIBETANS WERE AGAINST THE IDEA FEARING FOR HIS SAFETY 
THE DALAI LAMA HOWEVER WAS DETERMINED TO GO 
HE SAW IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO CHAIRMAN MAO IN PERSON 
THEN I FELT NOT ONLY ME 
BUT SOME OFFICIALS SOME HIGH OFFICIALS ER 
NOW TWO OPINIONS ONE OPINION 
NOW THIS IS HIGH TIME 
SHOULD GO TO BEIJING AND MEET HIGH OFFICIALS HIGH LEADERS 
THEN SOME 
VERY MUCH RELUCTANT VERY MUCH AGAINST 
I THINK OUT OF FEAR 
MY OWN OPINION IS 
NOW BETTER GO THERE 
THIS IS DEPARTING LHASA TO CHINA I THINK THIS ONE 
YOU KNOW I LIKE MISSIONS OR THESE MODERN THINGS 
SO I LOVE TO VISIT CHINA 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT LIKE JUST TOURIST 
ALSO HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY 
SO NOT VERY CERTAIN SO ALL KINDS OF MIXTURE FEELING 
UNDECISIVE LIKE THAT 
AND ALSO SOME EXCITEMENT 
THE DALAI LAMA ATTENDED THE FIRST NATIONAL CHINESE PEOPLE'S CONGRESS 
WHICH INCLUDED TEN SEATS FOR THE TIBETAN DELEGATION 
HE WAS IMPRESSED BY MAO AND FELT A GREAT AFFINITY 
WITH MANY OF THE EGALITARIAN PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNISM 
HOWEVER AT THEIR LAST MEETING MAO WASTED NO TIME 
IN GIVING HIS TRUE OPINION OF TIBET AND ITS FUTURE UNDER CHINESE RULE 
AS THE DALAI LAMA LEFT MAO TURNED TO HIM AND SAID RELIGION IS POISON 
THE DALAI LAMA RETURNED HOME 
NEWS REACHED HIM THAT THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES IN EASTERN TIBET 
WERE CONFISCATING LANDS BELONGING TO MONASTERIES 
AND REDISTRIBUTING THEM AMONGST THEMSELVES 
THE SITUATION DETERIORATED 
FIGHTING BROKE OUT BETWEEN THE CHINESE ARMY 
AND TIBETAN FREEDOM FIGHTERS AND REFUGEES BEGAN POURING INTO LHASA 
IN THE MIDST OF THIS TENSE ATMOSPHERE THE DALAI LAMA STILL HAD TO TAKE HIS FINAL MONASTIC EXAMS 
THE MAIN FOCUS OF WHICH WERE PUBLIC DEBATES 
DEBATE IS THE RIGOROUS DISCUSSION OF BUDDHIST TEACHINGS 
EVERYTHING IS CHALLENGED 
DEBATE IS AN ANCIENT TRADITION WITHIN BUDDHISM WHICH IS STILL PRACTISED TODAY 
ALTHOUGH THE MONKS AND NOW NUNS ARE SOMEWHAT MORE VIGOROUS IN THEIR STYLE THAN THEY WERE IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
THESE MONKS ARE ARGUING OVER THEIR PERSONAL INTERPRETATION OF BUDDHIST TEXTS 
THE SKILL IS IN ARGUING AND USING LOGIC IN YOUR OWN ANALYSIS TO BACK UP YOUR POINTS 
THEY ARE PUNCTUATED WITH CLAPS TO THE HAND 
THE RESPONDENT MUST THEN REPLY 
THE CULMINATION OF THE DALAI LAMA'S EIGHTEEN YEARS OF STUDY 
WAS AN EXAMINATION FOR A DOCTORATE IN BUDDHIST PHILOSOPHY 
IT STARTED WITH DEBATES IN THREE OF THE LARGEST MONASTERIES IN TIBET 
DREPUNG MONASTERY HAD TEN THOUSAND RESIDENT MONKS 
EIGHT THOUSAND OF THEM WERE SQUEEZED INTO THE SQUARE TO SEE THE DALAI LAMA 
AS HE ARRIVED WITH HIS RETINUE TO TAKE HIS FIRST EXAM 
THE MONASTERY OWNED LOCAL ESTATES AND HAD SOME TWENTY THOUSAND TIED PEASANTS 
WHO WORKED THE LAND AND PAID THEM TAXES 
THE REVENUE PAID FOR THE PRAYER SESSIONS AND FESTIVALS WHICH DOMINATED MONASTIC LIFE 
FEEDING THE MONKS FOR BIG EVENTS LIKE THE EXAMINATIONS WAS A HUGE IF SOMEWHAT RUSHED PROCESS 
THE YOUNG MONKS RUN DOWN FROM THE COOKHOUSE 
CARRYING HUGE TUBS OF SAMPA FOR THE BRETHREN WHO ARE SITTING IN THE SQUARE 
SAMPA IS ROASTED BARLEY FLOUR MIXED WITH YAK BUTTER TEA OR WATER TO MAKE DOUGH 
TO CELEBRATE HIS HOLINESS'S PRESENCE THE MONKS ARE ALSO GIVEN PRAYER SCARVES TEA AND MONEY 
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE DALAI LAMA 
WOULD HAVE DEBATED IN PUBLIC AND WITH THE MOST EXPERIENCED ABBOTS IN THE MONASTERY 
NOW THIS ABOUT TOP SCHOLAR MONGOLIAN 
HE ASK QUESTION VERY RAPIDLY 
OUR TOP SCHOLAR IS VERY RAPIDLY PUTTING QUESTION QUESTION 
THEN NO TIME HOW TO PRETEND 
OR HOW TO 
DEFEND LIKE THAT 
SO NOW THIS IS MY TURN DEBATE 
THE NEXT EXAM WAS AT SERA MONASTERY THE WHOLE OF THE DALAI LAMA'S GOVERNMENT TRAVELLED WITH HIM 
ALLOWING HIM TO CONSULT WITH THEM ABOUT THE GROWING TENSION IN LHASA 
AT THE SAME TIME HE HAD TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT SERIES OF DEBATES 
BUT THE ABBOTS EACH HAD THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL STYLE OF ARGUING 
IN SERA MONASTERY 
YOU SEE WHEN YOU DEBATE 
WITH THE OPPONENT 
GOOD SCHOLAR 
THEN THEIR ANSWER IS SOMETHING LOGICAL OR SOMETHING 
VALID MEANINGFUL 
IN SERA MONASTERY ONE ABBOT NOT THAT MUCH SCHOLAR NOT THAT TOP 
SO YOU SEE FROM MY SIDE THE PREPARATION IF ANSWER COME THIS WAY 
YES THIS IS THE WAY TO ARGUE 
IF THIS WAY 
IF ANSWERS COME THIS KIND OF ANSWER THEN YES ALREADY PREPARED 
AND HIS ANSWER UNEXPECTED ANSWER 
SO THEN MY TUTOR NOTICED THAT AND HE VERY KINDLY 
STOP NOW FINISH O. K. 
THAT'S TREMENDOUS RELIEF 
THE LAST OF THE PRELIMINARY EXAMS WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM LHASA 
AT GANDEN MONASTERY 
IRONICALLY THE EXAMINATIONS AT GANDEN PROVED TO BE A BRIEF PERIOD OF RESPITE FOR DALAI LAMA 
THOUSANDS MORE REFUGEES HAD FLED THE FIGHTING IN THE EAST AND ARRIVED IN LHASA 
A HUGE NUMBER WERE NOW CAMPED AROUND THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY 
TENSIONS WITH THE OCCUPYING CHINESE WHO'D BEEN IN TIBET FOR ABOUT NINE YEARS WERE HIGH 
THERE WERE FOOD SHORTAGES IN LHASA AND RUMOURS ABOUT MASSACRES IN EASTERN TIBET 
AND ALSO RUMOURS ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF SACRED SITES 
MEANWHILE THE DALAI LAMA STILL HAD HIS FINAL EXAM TO TAKE 
THE DALAI LAMA RETURNED TO LHASA 
AND CONTINUED TO PREPARE FOR HIS FINAL EXAM 
AMIDST INCREASINGLY DISTURBING REPORTS OF CHINESE ATROCITIES 
HE ATTEMPTED TO CONCENTRATE ON HIS STUDIES 
HE TOOK SOLACE IN BUDDHIST TEACHINGS THAT ONE'S ENEMY IS ONE'S GREATEST TEACHER 
AND TO HAVE COMPASSION FOR ALL SENTIENT BEINGS 
THE FINAL EXAM WAS ARRANGED TO TAKE PLACE AT THE SAME TIME AS THE NEW YEAR FESTIVAL 
THERE WERE THIRTY THOUSAND MONKS IN THE CITY AND PILGRIMS WERE ARRIVING FROM ALL OVER TIBET 
THE JOKHANG TEMPLE WAS FULL TO BURSTING 
THE CABINET CIVIL OFFICIALS AND ALL THE SENIOR ABBOTS AND MONKS WERE PRESENT 
AS A JUNIOR MONK OFFICIAL 
THIS MAN WAS IN THE AUDIENCE 
ON THE ONE HAND THE ORDINARY PEOPLE AND THE ARISTOCRATS WERE ALL DRESSED UP IN THEIR FINEST 
ON THE OTHER RIGHT NEXT DOOR THE CHINESE WERE MAKING ELABORATE MILITARY PREPARATIONS 
WITH SOLDIERS CARRYING RIFLES AS IF THEY MIGHT ATTACK AT ANY MOMENT 
GUN EMPLACEMENTS WERE BUILT THERE WERE CHINESE CARRYING RIFLES PATROLLING THE ROOFTOPS OPPOSITE 
EVERYONE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THE CLERGY THE PEOPLE 
WERE THERE FOR THE RELIGIOUS FUNCTION OF THE THIRTEENTH 
BUT THEY SAW CLEARLY THE CHINESE SOLDIERS WALKING AROUND ON THE ROOFTOPS 
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THAT THESE TWO EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS COULD BE HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME 
THE POSITION BETWEEN THE CHINESE AND THE TIBETANS WAS BECOMING IRRECONCILABLE 
ONE ASPECT THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE IS SO TENSE 
MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY FELT WHETHER THIS BIG GATHERING 
CAN TAKE PLACE OR NOT BECAUSE SO MUCH TENSE 
BUT THEN EVERYTHING GO VERY SMOOTHLY SO EVERYBODY VERY HAPPY 
THE DALAI LAMA RETURNED TO THE NORBULINGKA WITH HIS FULL RETINUE 
BUT THIS TIME HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY ARMED GUARDS 
LITTLE DID HE KNOW THAT THIS ONE THOUSAND YEAR OLD CEREMONIAL PROCESSION THROUGH LHASA WOULD BE HIS LAST 
THE CHINESE GOVERNOR GENERAL OF TIBET INVITED THE DALAI LAMA 
TO SEE A DANCE TROUPE AT THE CHINESE MILITARY HEADQUARTERS 
IN THE NAME OF DISPENSING WITH FORMALITY THE CHINESE REQUESTED 
THAT HE ATTEND WITH UNARMED BODYGUARDS 
WORRIED THAT A REFUSAL WOULD WORSEN THE FRAGILE SITUATION 
THE DALAI LAMA ACCEPTED BUT THE NEWS SOON SPREAD 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SURROUNDED THE PALACE DEMANDING THAT THE DALAI LAMA DID NOT GO 
INTELLIGENCE REPORTS REACHED HIM THAT THE CHINESE WERE ABOUT TO BOMB THE PALACE 
CONVINCED THAT IF HE LEFT THE PEOPLE WOULD BE SAVED THE DALAI LAMA DECIDED HE HAD TO LEAVE 
OF COURSE I THINK TOPMOST 
IN MY MIND IS FEAR SADNESS 
AND ALMOST LIKE THE FEELING OF DESPERATE 
AND ALSO 
LEAVING SOME OF MY CLOSE FRIENDS 
SWEEPERS OR SOME MONKS 
WHO LOOK AFTER TEMPLES OR LIBRARIES IN NORBULINGKA 
AND INCLUDING MY DOG 
SO AT A HUMAN LEVEL 
VERY SAD 
ONE FACTOR 
THEN ALSO SEVERAL THOUSAND TIBETAN 
SUPPOSE DIFFERENT NORBULINGKA ALL GATHERED THERE 
SO THAT ALSO ADDITIONAL WORRY 
IF SOMETHING HAPPEN 
THEN THOUSANDS PEOPLE WILL DIE 
THEN ALSO ER MY OWN LIFE 
THERE IS DANGER ONE PERSON'S FUTURE BUT THE FUTURE OF TIBET ALSO IS RELATED 
SO THEREFORE 
ANXIETY 
FEAR 
A LITTLE DOUBT HESITATION AND SADNESS 
ALL MIXED VERY MUCH MIXED 
THAT NIGHT THE DALAI LAMA ESCAPED FROM THE NORBULINGKA DISGUISED AS A TIBETAN SOLDIER 
THEN NEXT DAY REACH SOUTHERN TIBET 
THEN FEAR OF MY LIFE 
THEN NO LONGER 
THEN WE HAVE NO HESITATION 
TO CRITICISE ABOUT OUR CHINESE BROTHERS AND SISTERS 
ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES WE CRITICISE BUT FROM ONE CORNER OF OUR MIND ER WE 
OH BE CAREFUL BE CAREFUL 
THAT KIND OF SITUATION 
THEN AS SOON AS REACH SOUTHERN TIBET 
FREE FROM CHINESE FORCES 
WE GET SOME 
SOME EXTRAORDINARY FEELING NOW FREE 
FREEDOM 
TWO WEEKS LATER AFTER AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY THROUGH THE HIMALAYAS 
THE DALAI LAMA REACHED SAFETY IN NORTHERN INDIA 
THAT MORNING AROUND DAWN 
THEY BEGAN SHELLING THE NORBULINGKA AT AROUND NINE OR TEN 
I WENT TO THE HILL TO THE DEFENSIVE POSITION I HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO MONITOR 
WHEN I LOOKED I SAW THERE WAS A HUGE FIRE IN THE EASTERN WING 
NEAR THE ACCOUNTS SECTION A HUGE FIRE 
THE BOMBARDMENT STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE HILLS UPWARDS 
THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY THE RAT A TA TAT OF MACHINE GUN FIRE IT WAS RELENTLESS 
IN ANY CASE EVENTUALLY EVERYWHERE WAS TAKEN OVER AND COMPLETELY LOOTED 
EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR A FEW CHAPELS IT WAS LEFT LIKE AN EMPTY SHELL 
EVERYTHING ELSE WAS DESTROYED 
THEN THE RELENTLESS BOMBARDMENT BEGAN 
IN THE DUST AND SMOKE I SAW PEOPLE AND HORSES FALLING 
THE INTENSE BOMBARDMENT WENT ON FOR ABOUT AN HOUR OR TWO 
THAT DAY OVER A THOUSAND OF OUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED 
I SAW IT ALL WITH MY VERY OWN EYES 
THE TIBETAN RESISTANCE MADE UP OF FREEDOM FIGHTERS AND MONKS 
HAD TAKEN UP ARMS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES WERE NO MATCH FOR THE CHINESE ARMY 
THEY SURRENDERED AFTER THREE DAYS 
THE TIBETAN GOVERNMENT WAS ABOLISHED 
AND THE CHINESE SYSTEMATICALLY BEGAN TO DESTROY TIBETAN SOCIETY 
AND ITS BUDDHIST CULTURE AND TRADITIONS 
MONASTERIES WERE LOOTED AND SCRIPTURES BURNED 
NUNS AND MONKS WERE FORCED TO DENOUNCE THEIR FAITH 
THEY WERE ALSO MADE TO DISCARD THEIR ROBES AND GROW THEIR HAIR 
THEY WERE EVEN FORCED TO MARRY EACH OTHER 
CLASS RESENTMENT AMONG US PEASANTS OVER TIBET'S FEUDAL SYSTEM WAS RUTHLESSLY EXPLOITED 
THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT GRANTED THE DALAI LAMA POLITICAL ASYLUM 
EIGHTY THOUSAND REFUGEES FROM TIBET ESCAPED FROM TIBET TO JOIN HIM 
HE'S LIVED HERE IN DHARAMSALA KNOWN AS LITTLE LHASA EVER SINCE 
THE DALAI LAMA APPEALED TO THE UNITED NATIONS 
CALLING ON CHINA TO RESPECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF TIBETANS AND THEIR DESIRE FOR SELF DETERMINATION 
DESPITE THREE RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
THE FACT THAT THOUSANDS OF MONASTERIES WERE DESTROYED 
AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TIBETANS WERE IMPRISONED IN LABOUR CAMPS 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REFUSED TO INTERVENE 
IT'S TRAGIC THAT TIBETANS HAVE LOST THEIR HOMELAND 
AND WITH NO TANGIBLE INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION 
BUT COMING HERE LOOKING AROUND ONE CAN SEE THAT DESPITE EVERYTHING 
TIBETANS RETAIN THEIR SENSE OF NATIONAL IDENTITY THEIR CULTURE AND THEIR PRIDE 
LOOKING AT THIS PICTURES THAT YOU HAVE HERE IN FRONT OF ME 
IT'S ENTIRELY A DIFFERENT WORLD 
AND IT WAS TO ME IT'S VERY SAD 
ER FOR INSTANCE LIKE MY GRANDFATHER WANTED TIBET 
IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL TO TALK ABOUT TIBET YOU KNOW 
ER MY GRANDFATHER WANTED TIBET TO BE WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
AND TO JOIN THE UNITED NATIONS TO EDUCATE THE TIBETANS OUTSIDE 
TO BE WITH THE MODERN WORLD 
BUT HIS VISIONS AND HIS WISHES 
AND ALSO THE THIRTEENTH DALAI LAMA AND THE FOURTEENTH DALAI LAMA 
HAD WISHED THAT WE MUST HAVE CONTACT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL WORLD 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY FROM OUR OWN SIDE 
WE WERE JUST SO ENGROSSED IN OUR LITTLE POND 
YOU KNOW 
SO WE KNEW NOTHING WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO THE WORLD 
WHAT COULD HAPPEN AND SO WE LOST OUR COUNTRY 
THE DALAI LAMA ADVOCATES A MIDDLE WAY WHICH MEANS HE WANTS TIBETANS 
TO MOVE BACK TO TIBET EVEN IF THEY BECOME A MINORITY WITHIN CHINA 
BUT A MINORITY WITH A DEGREE OF SELF RULE 
HE REMAINS DETERMINED THAT A DIALOGUE 
BETWEEN THE CHINESE AND THE TIBETANS REMAINS PEACEFUL AND POSITIVE 
MIDDLE APPROACH IS THE BEST 
SO PRESENT CHINESE GOVERNMENT POLICY REGARDING 
DIFFERENT MINORITIES PARTICULARLY REGARDING TIBET IS NOT HEALTHY OR NOT GOOD 
FOR LONG RUN 
SO KIND OF NEW OPINIONS 
AS A RESULT OF BETTER AWARENESS NOW COMING 
SO THEREFORE BASICALLY I'M HOPEFUL 
THANK YOU 
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT REMAINS ADAMANT THAT TIBET IS NOT AN INDEPENDENT NATION 
ALL THE BUDDHIST CEREMONIES AND RITUALS WE'VE SEE IN THIS FILM 
ARE STILL BANNED IN THE DALAI LAMA'S HOMELAND OF TIBET
