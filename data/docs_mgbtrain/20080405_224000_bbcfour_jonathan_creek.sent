MORNING BENJAMIN 
HOW ARE YOU TODAY 
O. K. MY NAME IS MARTHA PARRISH 
PERSONAL SECRETARY TO LADY THERESA CUTLER 
ON HER BEHALF MAY I WELCOME YOU TO CICADA PARK 
THE HOUSE IS OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
AND IS STILL THE PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE OF LADY THERESA AND HER FAMILY 
HER HUSBAND SYLVESTER LE FLEY IS THE FAMOUS THEATRE CRITIC 
AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS COLUMNIST ON THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH 
FRIDAY TENTH ARTS DESK F. A. O. DEREK CHINNERY 
EDGAR BINT'S LATEST EFFORT AT THE COTTESLOE UPLOAD DOWNLOAD 
WAS BILLED AS A HILARIOUS NEW COMEDY 
OF THESE FOUR WORDS ONLY THE FIRST IS ACCURATE 
WHILE NEITHER HILARIOUS NEW OR COMIC IT IS MOST CERTAINLY AN INDEFINITE ARTICLE 
THE FACT THAT IT DREW MANIACAL LAUGHTER FROM THE BRAINLESS HYENAS AROUND ME 
MERELY CONFIRMS MY LONG HELD BELIEF THAT QUALITY THEATRE IS TOO PRECIOUS TO BE WASTED ON AUDIENCES 
MUMMY CAN I HAVE A TREE HOUSE OF COURSE SWEETHEART 
NOT JUST THIS SECOND THOUGH 
SAUMON FUME DARLING 
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE HUNGRY 
YOU READ MY MIND 
ARGH 
THE DOORS IN THIS PART OF THE HOUSE ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST 
THEY'RE OF HAND CARVED SPANISH MOORISH DESIGN 
DATING BACK TO THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS 
WHEN THE FIFTEENTH MARQUESS HAD THEM SPECIALLY IMPORTED 
YOU DEMENTED HARPY I CAN'T HAVE A SIMPLE MASSAGE NOW 
WITH HER ARM UP YOUR SHORTS YOU ARE INSANE 
EVERYTHING IS AN ACT OF INFIDELITY WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY TONGUE 
I CAN'T SPEAK 
GO SUCK A DOCK LEAF 
THIS WE CALL THE FLEMISH GALLERY 
HOUSING WORKS BY WELL KNOWN DUTCH GENRE PAINTERS 
EVERYTHING IN THIS ROOM HAS BEEN IN THE HOUSE AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
APART FROM ERIC WHO'S BEEN HERE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
SO WE COME TO THE JEWEL OF CICADA PARK EL GRECO'S KISS OF JUDAS 
WHICH WE KEEP IN A ROOM ON ITS OWN 
WHERE TEMPERATURE HUMIDITY AND LIGHT LEVELS ARE MAINTAINED 
TO PREVENT DISCOLOURATION OR CRACKING 
BECAUSE OF THIS WE CAN ALLOW ONLY EIGHT PEOPLE INSIDE AT A TIME 
SO WHO'S GONNA BE MY FIRST GROUP 
AS I SAY THE AMBIENT LIGHT 
IS CONTROLLED BY THE SPECIAL TINTING IN THE GLASS ABOVE YOU 
IF I COULD ASK YOU TO CLOSE THE DOOR WHILE WE'RE IN HERE PLEASE INSURANCE COMPANY RULES 
BECAUSE THE PICTURE THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU IS CONSERVATIVELY VALUED AT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION 
O. K. WHEN THE REST OF YOU ARE READY 
WHO'S THIS THAT'S BY A PAINTER CALLED OSTADE A PUPIL OF FRANS HALS 
RIGHT LET'S HAVE THE NEXT GROUP PLEASE 
O. K. 
AS I SAID TO YOUR FRIENDS THE REASON WE MUST BE EXTRA CAREFUL 
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING 
ERIC 
ERIC 
IT'S GONE IT CAN'T HAVE CUT FROM THE FRAME HOW 
THIS IS ABSURD 
THE WHOLE THING IS JUST ABSURD 
I THINK IT'S BEST IF YOU ALL JUST I'M SORRY I'M IN SHOCK 
I CAN'T THINK HOW THIS HAS HAPPENED 
ERIC 
MARTHA MARTHA ERIC SAID THE EL GRECO SOMEONE'S JUST 
PERHAPS WE'RE ALL DREAMING IT WAS THERE THIRTY SECONDS BEFORE 
AND THEN IT WASN'T AND THE ROOM WAS EMPTY I SWEAR

IF IT'S LIKE THIS WHEN WE GET TO HYDE PARK WE'LL HAVE FUN AND GAMES 
WE'LL NEED SYNCHRONISED SWIMMERS 
WILL YOU SHUT UP AND KEEP THE KNOTS DRY I'M ATTEMPTING A STATE OF OSTEO MUSCULAR PRECONTRACTION 
BLOODY GANGSTERS

MM OUR ALL TIME FAVOURITE REVIEWER SYLVESTER LE FLEY D'YOU REMEMBER

HIM AND HIS WIFE HAD A PRICELESS PAINTING NICKED BROAD DAYLIGHT 
WELL HA HA HA SUCK ON THAT YOU SMARMY BASTARD WHERE ARE YOU GOING THEY'RE NERVOUS JONATHAN 
THEY NEED THEIR HANDS HELD THEY'RE NERVOUS COS YOU'RE IN THE COFFIN 
I KNEW IT WAS TOO EASY 
SO OH I DUNNO 
EVERYTHING'S SUCH A MESS WITH ME I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START 
HAVE YOU HAD ANY MORE EROTIC DREAMS ABOUT 
YOU KNOW WHO 
LAST NIGHT ACTUALLY 
WE WERE MAKING LOVE TOGETHER LIKE I DUNNO 
OLYMPIC GYMNASTS 
I THINK I GOT DOWN TO A SIZE TEN AT ONE POINT IT WAS INCREDIBLE 
BUT WE WERE ON STAGE AT THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE COVENT GARDEN AND THE AUDIENCE WERE BOOING AND SHOUTING 
BRING BACK THE JUGGLER 
WHICH I REMEMBER PUT US OFF SLIGHTLY COME WITH ME PLEASE 
PARDON DET INSP GREGSON THIS CONSULTATION'S OVER 
FOR WHAT REASON YOU'RE NO MORE A PSYCHOANALYST THAN I AM 
YOU WHAT SORRY ABOUT THIS 
IT'S A CONDITION OBSESSIVE DELUSION 
THE SUFFERER ACTS OUT A FANTASY ROLE TO SATISFY SOME UNFULFILLED DESIRE 
IN THIS CASE LISTENING TO PEOPLE'S SEXUAL NEUROSES THE PARTY'S OVER 
ALL RIGHT MR. GREGSON LEAVE HER BE PLEASE 
MR. GREGSON 
IT'S A PSYCHOTIC CONDITION IN WHICH HE BELIEVES HE IS A POLICE INSPECTOR 
WHEREAS YOU ACTUALLY WORK FOR THE NORTH THAMES GAS BOARD REMEMBER 
DO FORGIVE THE INTRUSION 
I'LL KEEP MY DOOR LOCKED IN FUTURE 
UNSETTLING WHEN THAT HAPPENS ISN'T IT 
NOW YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOME GENERAL SENSE OF CONFUSION IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE 
SORRY 
YES WELL 
THERE'S THIS ONGOING BUSINESS WITH JONATHAN OBVIOUSLY 
BUT THE OTHER DAY SOMETHING ELSE CROPPED UP AS WELL WHICH 
YOU KNOW THAT THING 
WHERE A GHOST FROM YOUR PAST SUDDENLY COMES BACK TO HAUNT YOU 
GREAT TO PUT A FACE TO THE NAME 
I'M SORRY DUE TO A COCK UP IN THE DIARY I SEEM TO HAVE TWO LUNCHES TODAY AND I'M ALREADY LATE FOR BOTH 
YEAH HE RANG ME AGAIN LAST NIGHT AND YES THURSDAY MORNING 
I'M GONNA SEE IT THROUGH BARRY 
MY THERAPIST RECKONS IT'LL BE GOOD FOR ME SO O. K. SHALL WE WEND 
I S'POSE I'D BETTER GET BACK COME ON WHAT D'YOU SAY I TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE SMART FOR LUNCH 
NOT THAT IT'S OTT OR ANYTHING JUST STICK WITH ME ON THIS ONE 
MISS MAGELLAN MR. CREEK 
HOW DO YOU DO MARTHA PARRISH 
YOU LIKE TO FOLLOW ME PLEASE 
IT'S JUST THROUGH HERE I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING FUSSY OMELETTE 
OH ARE YOU O. K. 
JONATHAN UNFORTUNATELY IS BORDERLINE ASTHMATIC 
CAN YOU GIVE US A SECOND OF COURSE I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIND MR. LE FLEY FOR YOU 
ALL RIGHT WHERE'S THE MIRROR 
JUST WANNA REMIND MYSELF WHAT A GULLIBLE PRAT LOOKS LIKE ALL RIGHT 
ALL RIGHT 
I'LL LEVEL WITH YOU THEY DON'T DO OMELETTES COME ON IT'S ONE HELL OF A PUZZLE 
A PAINTING THAT'S THERE ONE MINUTE AND GONE THE NEXT WILL I NEVER LEARN JONATHAN 
JUST COS THE BLOKE GAVE YOUR SHOW IFFY REVIEWS DEATH NOTICES IS NO REASON TO PASS UP A CHALLENGE 
BUT I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
TIS SO IMPOSSIBLE WHY EVEN TRY 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE WEIRD MYSTERIES 
IT'LL JUST NEVER BE EXPLAINED 
THAT THE ROOM DOWN THERE 
WINDOW'S MADE OF SOME KIND OF REINFORCED SPECIAL GLASS 
IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO BE OPENED 
EXCEPT WHERE ELSE COULD THEY HAVE GOT IN ARE YOU TWO MARRIED 
WHATEVER GAVE YOU THAT IDEA I SAW YOU ARGUING THAT'S RIGHT 
BUT IN OUR CASE WE'RE JUST ARGUING IN SIN MUMMY AND DADDY ALWAYS SHOUT AT EACH OTHER 
SOMETIMES THEY SHOUT AT ME BENJAMIN 
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD ABOUT TALKING TO STRANGE MEN AND WOMEN 
ANOTHER HABIT YOU'VE PICKED UP FROM MELISSA HIS LAST NANNY WAS A BAD INFLUENCE 
WE COME HOME AFTER TWO MONTHS ABROAD AND FIND HIM FRATERNISING WITH THE CAR MECHANIC 
THE CONSEQUENCES ARE UNTHINKABLE NEVER TRUST A MAN WITH AXLE GREASE ON HIS FINGERS EXACTLY 
AS FOR THIS HORROR THE POLICE ARE UP A GUM TREE 
SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THE FIFTY THOUSAND IS THERE FOR THE TAKING TO ANYONE WITH A POSITIVE LEAD 
OH YES THAT WAS THE OTHER THING 
THEY ARE OFFERING A SMALL REWARD FOR THE PAINTING'S RETURN 
WHICH CAN'T BE BAD 
NOW YOU SEE THIS IS WHERE I'M SITTING HERE 
NOT THERE NOT THERE BUT HERE WHERE I'VE GOT A DIRECT LINE THROUGH THAT DOOR 
EATING MY LUNCH WHICH ON FRIDAY COMPRISED LUCOZADE AND A SPAM SANDWICH 
WHEN MRS. PARRISH CAME OUT WITH THOSE GIRLS IT WAS THERE ON THE WALL IN ITS FRAME 
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING THAT SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT'VE STEPPED IN OR OUT IN BETWEEN WITHOUT MY NOTICING 
WHEN THAT PAINTING WAS STOLEN 
THERE WAS NO ONE INSIDE THAT ROOM 
YOU'D COME FROM THE FLEMISH GALLERY AND YOU'RE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW 
WHEN SOMEONE ATTACKED YOU WITH A SHARP INSTRUMENT 
AS I SEEM TO HAVE TOLD EVERYONE ONE HUNDRED TIMES THEN I FELL TO THE GROUND 
WHERE PARDON ME 
YOU COULDN'T SHOW US 
ON THE FLOOR WHERE YOU FELL 
EXACTLY 
THAT'S WHEN YOU HEARD WHOEVER IT WAS RUNNING AWAY PRESUMABLY INTO THE LIBRARY THEY FOUND FOOTPRINTS 
WHICH DO NOT CORRESPOND TO ANY SHOES WORN BY MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSEHOLD 
MIGHT BE WORTH A SHUFTY 
INTERESTING 
TWO RIDDLES IN ONE HOW'S THAT 
SETTING ASIDE THE PROBLEM OF HOW OUR INVISIBLE THIEF MANAGED TO GET PAST EVERYONE WITH THE PAINTING 
THEY'D BE IN A HURRY TO GET OUT THE 
OH COME ON A CHILD OF FIVE COULD WORK IT OUT I CAN WORK IT OUT 
WHY DIDN'T HE GO ACROSS THE CARPET 
EXACTLY 
HE'S HEADING FOR THE WINDOW SO WHY GO ROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM 
RIDDLE NUMBER ONE 
RIDDLE NUMBER TWO WHY WAS HE WALKING THESE AREN'T THE FOOTSTEPS OF A RUNNING MAN MR. LE FLEY 
WHOEVER WAS IN HERE IT WASN'T THE PERSON WHO ATTACKED YOU IN THE HALL WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE 
MISS MAGELLAN WHO IS AM I RIGHT AN INVESTIGATIVE CRIME WRITER 
AND MR. CREEK IS CREATIVE CONSULTANT TO ADAM KLAUS YOU SAW ONE OF OUR SHOWS REMEMBER 
IT WAS A RAGBAG OF CHICANERY ILL CONCEIVED BY WITLESS TRICKSTERS 
WHO SEEMED TO CONFUSE MYSTERY WITH MISERY 
TURN OF PHRASE HE'S GOT HASN'T HE SO ANYWAY 
I MAKE NO SECRET OF MY AVERSION TO YOUR PARTICULAR ART FORM MR. CREEK 
HOWEVER I CONCEDE ITS RELEVANCE TO THE PROBLEMS IN HAND ANY INSIGHTS WE'LL BE PLEASED TO HEAR THEM 
IT'S A STUMPER 
NO QUESTION 
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T HELP 
SO THIS HAS BEEN A COMPLETE WASTE OF OUR TIME 
IT'S DEFEATED EVERYONE ELSE LORD KNOWS WHY WE EXPECTED YOU TO GET IT 
IT DOESN'T DEFEAT ME I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOUR PAINTING DISAPPEARED 
I'M JUST NOT GOING TO TELL YOU TIME WE WERE MOVING 
FIFTY THOUSAND 
GREEN ONES JONATHAN 
SO YOU'VE WORKED OUT HOW THE WHOLE THING WAS DONE BUT YOU WANT TO MAKE HIM SUFFER 
CORRECT 
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S BEING AMAZINGLY PETTY 
STILL 
I SUPPOSE NO ONE CAN BLAME YOU THE MAN'S A GRADE A TOSSBAG I CAN'T DENY 
YES WHY DON'T WE MAKE HIM STEW 
WHY SHOULD WE LET HIM KNOW WHAT WE KNOW 
WHAT UM DO WE KNOW EXACTLY 
OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN TELL ME 
DREAM ON 
WITLESS TRICKSTER NOT FAR OFF THE MARK FOR YOU REALLY IS IT 
SWEETHEART NO ONE'S DENYING YOUR INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE SHOW 
OR THE UNIQUE PLACE YOU OCCUPY IN MY AFFECTIONS 
WHEN IT COMES TO MEETING HER MAJESTY I GOTTA WATCH WHO I BRING ALONG 
OH DON'T TAKE IT AS ANY KIND OF SLIGHT 
BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WOULD ABSOLUTELY ADORE YOU 
LOVELY IT'S BEEN A BIG HELP THANKS A LOT YOU'RE VERY WELCOME 
IT'S NO SWEAT I'LL WORK IT OUT MYSELF I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING YOU'VE SEEN I'M NOT A COMPLETE MORON 
YES 
I NEVER SAID ANYTHING 
LOOK JUST GIVE ME A LEG UP TO GET ME STARTED PLEASE 
JUST ONE TINY CLUE 
LOOK TO ERIC'S SPAM SANDWICH 
IT CONTAINS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE AFFAIR 
SORRY ABOUT THE TIME GUESS WHERE I'VE JUST COME FROM 
MR. POISON PEN SYLVESTER LE FLEY'S 
ONE OF THE WEIRDEST SETUPS I'VE 
YES YES YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT THAT LATER DID YOU SEE LARRY ABOUT MORE PLAY ON THE DOWELS IN THE COFFIN 
HE'LL SEE WHAT HE CAN DO IF THEY'RE TOO LOOSE IT'LL RUIN THE AUDIENCE INSPECTION 
JUST ENOUGH SO I DON'T BREAK MY SPINE IT'S THE BIGGEST OPEN AIR MAGIC SHOW IN BRITAIN FOR SEVENTY YEARS 
NOW THURSDAY WEEK BUCKINGHAM PALACE HAVE YOU COME UP WITH ANYTHING WHAT'S TO COME UP WITH 
YOU'RE BEING PRESENTED TO THE QUEEN ADAM YOU JUST SHAKE HER HAND COP YOUR M. B. E. AND THEN OFF 
NO NO IT NEEDS A LITTLE SOMETHING TO LEAVEN IT 
A STAMP ON ARE YOU INSANE 
IT'S PERFECT I GET HER TO STICK IT OUT WHAT'S THIS 
I KNOW THIS FACE COULD YOU SIGN IT FOR ME 
BIG LAUGH WHAT DO YOU THINK HOW COULD WE DO THAT 
YOU WINNING 
OH RIGHT COME TO GLOAT I SUPPOSE ON MY INEPTITUDE 
COME ON YOU DUPED ME INTO GOING ROUND THERE COS YOU KNEW I'D NEVER AGREE TO HELP SYLVESTER LE FLEY 
REWARD OR NO REWARD SO WHY ARE YOU BACK HERE YOU STILL OWE ME LUNCH 
GO ON THEN WE'LL GIVE THAT ITALIAN ROUND THE CORNER A TRY 
JUST UM GIVE ME A MINUTE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF CALLS PUT A FACE ON I'LL BE WITH YOU 
OF COURSE YOU MIGHT KNOW JACK SHIT ABOUT ANY OF IT 
THIS COULD BE AN ELABORATE BLUFF TO MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A TOTAL DUNCE WHILE YOU ACT ALL SUPERIOR 
WHICH SHOWS YOUR LATENT INSECURITY COMPLEX MY INSECURITY COMPLEX 
YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU HOW THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED YES HOW THE PAINTING DISAPPEARED YES 
SO YOU CAN COLLECT THE REWARD YES NO ALL RIGHT YES 
CAN'T WE FORGET THIS STUPID VENDETTA AND POCKET THE DOSH WE COULD MAKE SOME SERIOUS MONEY HERE 
THE PAIR OF THEM ARE DESPERATE THE INSURANCE COMPANY ARE BEING STICKY ABOUT THE CLAIM 
I BET IF I PHONED HIM I COULD MAKE HIM DOUBLE THAT REWARD EASILY 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND JONATHAN 
YOU RECKON I'M SURE OF IT 
SO INSTEAD OF SAYING STUFF YOUR FIFTY GRAND I COULD SAY STUFF YOUR ONE HUNDRED GRAND EVEN MORE SATISFYING 
I SURRENDER 
ALL RIGHT 
AS THAT WAS A RATHER FINE LINGUINI YOU BOUGHT ME LET'S TAKE A LOOK 
THE FIRST LOAD OF SCHOOLGIRLS COME OUT WITH HIS SECRETARY THE PAINTING'S THERE IN FULL VIEW 
THIRTY SECONDS LATER IT'S BEEN CUT OUT OF ITS FRAME AND REMOVED NO CONCEIVABLE HIDING PLACE 
THEN THE THIEF SOMEHOW ESCAPED WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND KNOCKED OUT MR. LE FLEY 
THE OVERHEAD WINDOW DOESN'T OPEN 
POLICE SAID THERE WAS NO SIGN IT HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH 
I DON'T KNOW I'VE BEEN WORKING ON EVERY CONCEIVABLE POSSIBILITY 
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT SOMEONE COULD'VE CUT IT WITHOUT ACTUALLY BEING IN THE ROOM 
USING A HIGH POWERED LASER THROUGH THE GLASS IN THE CEILING YOU ARE KIDDING ME 
COURSE I AM THE IDEA'S RIDICULOUS 
THE TRICK'S SO SIMPLE YOU'LL WONDER WHY YOU DIDN'T GET IT IN FIVE SECONDS FLAT 
OH PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY 
WHAT WAS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A SODDING SPAM SANDWICH 
AH ABSOLUTELY 
AND FOR THAT MATTER WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SCENTED ROOM 
WHICH PUTS YET ANOTHER SPIN ON IT THE SCENTED ROOM 
YOU CLOCKED IT TOO WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THAT DOOR 
A FRAGRANCE OF SOMETHING SWEET AND FLORAL IN THAT DRAWING ROOM 
THAT'S RIGHT COMING FROM THE BOWL OF POTPOURRI ON THE TABLE 
YOU MEAN POTPOURRI ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
PEOPLE PICK IT UP IN A SHOP AND GO 
M. M. M. SMELL THIS ONE SENSATIONAL I'LL HAVE SOME OF THAT COURSE IT IS IF YOU SHOVE YOUR FACE IN IT 
OTHERWISE YOU CAN'T SMELL A THING 
SHOULD BE A LABEL ONLY WORKS IF INSERTED UP NOSTRIL 
IS THERE A POINT TO THIS THE POINT IS THAT THE SMELL WASN'T COMING FROM THE POTPOURRI 
I'M NOT WITH YOU WHAT ARE YOU SAYING 
PERFUMES DON'T HANG AROUND FOR TWO DAYS 
WELL 
THEN 
MR. CREEK IS IT DETECTIVE INSPECTOR ROY GREGSON 
YOU'VE GOT ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS TO ANSWER IT MAY BE THAT YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED AS IT 
LET ME HANDLE THIS 
ARE YOU AWARE IT'S AN OFFENCE TO WITHHOLD INFORMATION YOU'D BETTER TELL ME RIGHT NOW 
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT THE THEFT OF LADY THERESA CUTLER'S PAINTING 
OR WE CAN PLAY HARDBALL 
WHY HAS YOUR I. D. GOT NORTH THAMES GAS BOARD ON IT 
DON'T BE CLEVER FAILURE TO DISCLOSE EVIDENCE IS A SERIOUS MATTER 
SO IS IMPERSONATING A POLICE OFFICER NICE TRY 
I HAVE TO BE GOING I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT 
OH JONATHAN 
I HAD TO HAVE A CONTINGENCY PLAN YOU CAN'T BLAME ME FOR THAT 
O. K. NOW YOU CAN OPEN THEM 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YOU DID SAY YOU WANTED A TREE HOUSE 
WHAT'S THAT ON THE SIDE AH 
A LIFT 
SO YOU DON'T GET ALL SCRATCHED AND TEAR YOUR CLOTHES CLIMBING UP THE BRANCHES 
COME ON AS IF WE HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS AT THE MO 
SYLVESTER LE FLEY 
M. M. M. 
WHAT 
THEY ARE JOKING SURELY TO GOD 
TELL HIM I WANT TO SPEAK TO HIM NOW YOUR BLASTED INSURANCE COMPANY 
SAYS THERE ISN'T ENOUGH EVIDENCE OF A CRIME 
IF THAT CREEK DOES KNOW SOMETHING HE IS BLOODY WELL GOING TO TELL US 
WHAT'LL IT BE NOW A ROW OF FLAGS COMING OUT THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH'S FLIES JONATHAN CREEK 
JONATHAN I HAVE A QUERY IT'S MULTIPLE CHOICE IF YOU COULD CHOOSE HOW TO DIE WOULD IT BE 
A PEACEFULLY IN YOUR SLEEP B. BREATHLESSLY WITH NICOLE KIDMAN 
C. DISMEMBERMENT BY A HOMICIDAL ILLUSIONIST IF C. HANG UP NOW 
IF NOT GET YOUR BACKSIDE DOWN TO CICADA PARK AND EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT EL GRECO 
I'M SORRY I'M NOT WITH ANY OF THIS THEN LET ME KEEP IT SIMPLE FOR YOU 
LADY THERESA IS CHAIRPERSON OF THE LOCAL CONSERVATIVE ASSOCIATION 
AND WIELDS IMMENSE INFLUENCE OVER WESTMINSTER COUNCIL THE COUNCIL HAS THE POWER TO STOP OUR CONCERT 
SATURDAY'S CONCERT IN THE PARK WAS REFUSED A PERMIT 
IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY IN REALITY IT'S BECAUSE A MEMBER OF MY STAFF THINKS HE CAN'T BE BOUGHT 
WRONG JONATHAN MONEY CAN BUY ANYTHING AND ANYONE 
THIS IS A BATTLE WE CANNOT WIN SO DO THIS SURRENDER YOUR PRIDE AND SAVE THE SHOW 
BY TOMORROW LUNCHTIME I EXPECT TO HEAR GOOD NEWS 
OKEY DOKEY MY SWEET 
WILL DO THEN 
SURE CHEERIO BYE 
JONATHAN TO WHAT DO WE OWE 
YOU'RE LOOKING LOST YEAH 
THIS STOLEN PAINTING 
SOMETHING'S COME UP I'VE GOT TO MOVE ON IT AND I CAN'T TRACK HER NIBS DOWN FOR LOVE NOR MONEY 
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO I KNOW HE'S COMING DOWN TODAY GORDON HILL 
HOW MUCH HAS SHE TOLD YOU ABOUT ALL THIS ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE KNOWN MADELINE HOW LONG 
YOU DO YOU'LL FIND A LOT OF PROTECTIVE LAYERS LIKE SHE MAKES IT LOOK VERY EASY BUT IT HASN'T BEEN 
YOU NEVER KNEW HER FATHER NEITHER DID SHE 
HER MOTHER WAS A WRECK 
WHO LIVED ON HER NERVES 
ONE DAY SHE WAS STOPPED IN A STORE 
ACCUSED OF STEALING A PACKET OF BACON SHE SAID IT WAS A MISTAKE SUPERMARKET TOOK HER TO COURT 
NEXT DAY SHE PULLED THE WIRE FROM AN ELECTRIC IRON AND PUT IT IN HER MOUTH 
MADDY CAME HOME FROM WORK 
SHE WAS SEVENTEEN 
RAN AWAY AFTER THAT TO TRY AND PUT THE PAIN BEHIND HER EXCEPT IT NEVER GOES 
IT JUST SITS THERE 
WAITING FOR THE DAY WHEN YOU'LL COME BACK AND CONFRONT IT 
FOR MADDY TODAY IS THAT DAY 
SO WHO'S GORDON HILL 
LUNCH BREAK WE'VE TIMED IT WELL 
THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG JUST ONE LAST PIECE OF THE JIGSAW AND WE'RE ALL SET 
I WAS TOLD TO EXPECT YOU YOU HAVE SOME NEWS FOR US I BELIEVE 
BENJAMIN YOU ALL RIGHT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN ANOTHER TRICK 
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN MR. LE FLEY 
HOW BAFFLING WOULD YOU SAY THIS ROBBERY WAS 
IF THIS IS ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO ANTAGONISE ME TEN TWENTY A HUNDRED 
WE'VE DRIVEN OURSELVES DEMENTED TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT ALL RIGHT 
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR NO ONE'S IN ANY DOUBT THE PAINTING DID VANISH FROM THIS ROOM 
IT'S THE ONE FACTOR IN THIS BLASTED BUSINESS WE CAN BE CERTAIN OF WHY 
BECAUSE IT'LL MAKE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE 
IF EVERYONE COULD JUST LEAVE NOW EXCEPT FOR BENJAMIN BENJAMIN 
WHAT 
INDULGE HIM IT USUALLY PAYS OFF 
ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS WAS IT THE DOOR WAS CLOSED YES 
IF YOU WANT TO PUT A WATCH ON IT 
O. K. 
FOR GOD'S SAKE IT CAN'T BE 
NOW REMEMBER BENJ FIRST LAW OF MAGIC 
NEVER TELL THEM HOW IT WAS DONE 
THE UM SORDID MATTER OF THE REWARD 
LADY THERESA WHAT OH YES I'LL OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP WITH YOUR SON 
SO I DUNNO 
ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT IT'LL BE REALLY CATHARTIC 
WAS ABSOLUTE BOLLOCKS IN THE END 
THE ONLY WAY I COULD EVER GET THROUGH ALL THE HORROR IN LIFE 
WAS TO TRY AND FORGET ABOUT IT 
I THINK I MIGHT JUST HAVE STEPPED IN FRONT OF THAT DIGGER 
REMEMBER ME TELLING YOU ABOUT TALK ABOUT THE LAST PERSON I'D HAVE EVER SUSPECTED 
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT 
THROUGH A BORING PROCESS OF WATERTIGHT LOGIC 
THE SAME LOGIC THAT TOLD ME HOW YOU DID IT IT HAD TO BE ONE OF YOU 
WHAT WE'RE STILL HAZY ON IS 
YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK TO MELISSA MY SISTER SHE'LL BE ROUND AT JEFF'S 
SO THEN I'M THINKING MELISSA THE NAME HAD CROPPED UP EARLIER IT TOOK ME A MINUTE TO REMEMBER WHERE 
THAT'S ANOTHER HABIT WE'VE PICKED UP FROM MELISSA ISN'T IT HIS LAST NANNY WAS A TERRIBLY BAD INFLUENCE 
WELL WAS THAT A TALE AND A HALF WHEN IT ACTUALLY CAME OUT IN THE WASH 
JUDITH WHAT HAVE YOU SAID TO THEM D'YOU WANT TO GET US PUT AWAY NO ONE'S GONNA RAT ON YOU MELISSA 
YOU DIDN'T GET ON WITH THEM SO YOU SET THIS UP TO GET YOUR OWN BACK 
FOR WHICH JONATHAN WOULD LOVE TO GIVE YOU A BIG WET KISS 
I DON'T MIND SYLVESTER LE FLEY GETTING A HARD TIME WHICH OF HIS CHARMING QUALITIES DROVE YOU TO IT 
THEY HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THAT CHILD NO IDEA OR THEY DIDN'T CARE 
THEY WERE TOO INTO THEMSELVES AND INTO GADDING ROUND THE GLOBE 
ASPEN ONE DAY SAINT MORITZ THE NEXT THEY'D NEVER GIVEN BENJY ANY TIME 
ANY QUALITY TIME ANYTHING HE WANTED HE GOT EXCEPT WHAT HE REALLY NEEDED A MOTHER AND FATHER 
WHO WERE PREPARED TO MAKE THE EFFORT 
WHEN THEY WERE AROUND SHE'D OFTEN BE GIVING HER HUSBAND HELL OVER ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
SOMETIMES SHE'D GET QUITE VIOLENT TALK ABOUT VOLATILE 
OF COURSE MY APPROACH DIDN'T FIND FAVOUR AT ALL 
INDULGED HIM OF COURSE I DID I WORSHIPPED HIM 
WHEN THEY GAVE ME A FORTNIGHT'S NOTICE WELL THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH TEARS TO CRY 
I JUST THOUGHT 
IF ONLY I COULD PUT THEM THROUGH IT DEPRIVE THEM OF SOMETHING THEY REALLY LOVED 
SOMETHING LIKE A MILLION POUND PAINTING 
TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM THEM WITHOUT ACTUALLY STEALING IT I'VE GOTTA SAY WAS A NICE ONE 
EVERYONE COULD SEE IT HAD VANISHED BUT WHERE TO 
FLOOR AND WALLS OFFERED NO CLUE 
IT HAD TO BE THAT WINDOW BUT HOW DID YOU GET TO IT AND THEN OPEN IT 
ANSWER YOU DIDN'T THE WINDOW HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE POSSIBILITY LEFT IT WAS SO GLORIOUSLY UNLIKELY IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ANYONE 
THE CONTRASTING GRAIN ON EACH SIDE TOLD THE WHOLE STORY 
THE WAY THE ORIGINAL SPANISH BUILDERS HAD SECURED THE HAND CARVED PANELS TO THE FRAME 
MEANT THAT THE DOOR TECHNICALLY WAS HOLLOW 
IT WAS JEFF WHO FIRST SAW THE POSSIBILITIES 
HE WAS OVER HELPING ME CLEAR OUT MY STUFF 
MELISSA 
FINDING TIME WHEN ERIC AND MARTHA WERE OUT OF THE WAY WAS QUITE EASY 
WE OPENED A SLIT AT THE BOTTOM 
ADDED NAILS THAT COULD BE SWIVELLED ACROSS AND REHUNG IT 
EVERYTHING WAS SET JUDITH THOUGHT OF THE IDEA OF THE SCHOOL OUTING 
WHO'S GOING TO SUSPECT A BUNCH OF TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRLS SO WHAT HAPPENED 
SIX OF YOU WENT IN BUT ONLY FIVE CAME OUT BUT WHO'S COUNTING YOU 
HALF A MINUTE'S ENOUGH YOUR PALS KEEP MARTHA BUSY WITH QUESTIONS 
WHEN THE NEXT GROUP GOES IN AND EVERYONE'S GLUED TO THE EMPTY FRAME YOU MERGE IN WITH THEM 
FOR MY MONEY A WORLD CLASS TRICK 
WITH THE DELICIOUS IRONY THAT WHILE HE'S FREAKING OUT IT'S A FEW YARDS AWAY BETWEEN TWO PANELS OF WOOD 
LIKE A SLICE OF SPAM IN A SANDWICH 
THE REST OF IT WE HAVE TO GUESS 
I CAN PICTURE THERESA OUTSIDE GETTING BALLISTIC WITH HER HUSBAND 
YOU PATRONISING LOUSE GOD I'M SORRY HE DASHES INSIDE 
MAJOR PANIC ONE OF THEIR MOST VALUABLE ART TREASURES IS GONE 
AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT ANYONE WAS IN THERE THAT WON'T LOOK GOOD WHEN HE MAKES HIS INSURANCE CLAIM 
THEY'LL NEED MORE EVIDENCE THAN THAT SO WHAT DOES HE COME UP WITH 
AN IMAGINARY WHACK FROM BEHIND BY AN UNSEEN INTRUDER 
ARGH 
MR. LE FLEY ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
HE'S GOT THE HEAD WOUND COURTESY OF HIS WIFE IT'S A GIFT 
THE POLICE ERIC YES SOMEONE HIT ME AN INTRUDER 
THEY HAVE ONE OTHER IDEA BEFORE THE POLICE ARRIVE 
A SET OF FOOTPRINTS IN THE DUST ON THE FLOOR TO SHOW WHERE THE THIEF HAD LEFT THE BUILDING 
SLIGHT DRAWBACK NO DUST THE FLOOR HAD JUST BEEN CLEANED SO THEY CREATE THEIR OWN 
HENCE THE OVERPOWERING SMELL OF FREESIAS OR WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HIT US INSIDE THE ROOM 
SEE WHAT I'M SAYING IT'D BE A BRILLIANT READ IF I COULD USE IT 
BUT THAT WOULD DROP THE EX NANNY AND HER SISTER IN IT AND WE PROMISED TO KEEP SHTOOM 
YOU'VE GOT TO RESPECT A CONFIDENCE LIKE THAT SO SORRY WHERE WAS I 
YOU WILL STOP ME IF I START RAMBLING 
I WONDER WHY THEY STAY TOGETHER I MEAN THERE'S NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM OF ANY KIND 
IT'S HIS LACK OF EMBARRASSMENT 
TO GO TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE WITH A DOZEN CAGED BIRDS CONCEALED ABOUT YOUR PERSON IS A MAJOR ERROR 
IT KILLS A RELATIONSHIP WHEN PEOPLE STOP LISTENING TO EACH OTHER 
THE ROYAL FAMILY'S HARDLY GOT A PUCKISH SENSE OF HUMOUR 
WITH A CHILD INVOLVED THERE'S NO EXCUSE 
YOU JUST KNOW ONE'LL ESCAPE AND YOU KNOW WHERE IT'LL GO IF WE EVER HAD A SON IT WOULD WORK OUT 
WE'D MAKE SURE IT DID FIRST TIME THE QUEEN'S PRESENTED AN M. B. E. WITH A CANARY UP HER SKIRT 
HE WON'T BE TOPPING THE BILL AT THE ROYAL COMMAND THIS YEAR EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT JONATHAN 
SORRY HAVING A FAMILY 
SETTLING DOWN AND ALL THAT 
RIGHT VERY PROBABLY 
WHAT CAN I SMELL IN HERE 
IS IT TALCUM POWDER
