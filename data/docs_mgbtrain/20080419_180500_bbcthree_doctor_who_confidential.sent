SO JOIN CONFIDENTIAL BACKSTAGE 
AS WE SERVE YOU AN INSIGHT INTO THE OOD 
I WANTED THE OOD 
I WANTED ICE PLANETS I WANTED THE HUMANS AS SLAVE TRADERS 
I THINK THE OOD ARE LOVELY 
I THINK THERE'S MORE STORY WAITING TO BE TOLD 
BACK HERE YOU CAN HAVE THAT SHOT LINED UP FOR DAVE 
AND YOU CAN HAVE A TIGHTER ONE THAT STOPS HIM 
YEAH YUP SO YOU CAN COME OFF THE LINE HERE 
WE'RE IN A WAREHOUSE TODAY 
FILMING A SCENE WHERE THE DOCTOR IS CHASED BY A GIANT CLAW 
IT WAS TRYING TO FIND WAYS OF MAKING IT LOOK 
AS RISKY AS POSSIBLE AND TRYING TO FIND DIFFERENT WAYS 
OF COMING ROUND A CORNER 
SO IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE YOU WERE JUST RUNNING AWAY ALL THE TIME 
OF COURSE THE CLAW WAS BEING ADDED IN AFTERWARDS 
WE'VE GOT A PRE VIS THAT WE PUT TOGETHER AT THE MILL 
AND WE'VE ALREADY WORKED OUT ROUGH MOVES OF THIS C. G. I. ARM 
WE'RE GONNA TRY AND MATCH IT IN WITH THE ACTION YEAH 
SO WHEN WE COME TO FILM THE ELEMENTS THAT WE NEED HERE 
OF DAVID RUNNING DOWN THE AISLES WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT 
WE'VE GOT SHOTS OF DAVID RUNNING AWAY TOWARDS THE CAMERA 
AS THE CAMERA TRACKS BACKWARDS DOWN THE AISLES OF CONTAINERS 
WE'VE PRE VISED THAT SO WE CAN SEE WHAT IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE 
SO WHAT WE NEED DAVID TO DO IS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT 
SO HE WILL HAVE AN IDEA WHERE THE CLAW IS IN RELATION TO HIM 
WE SHOOT THE ELEMENT OF HIM RUNNING DOWN THE AISLE OF CONTAINERS 
ON THE BACK OF I THINK WE'VE GOT A QUAD BIKE OR SOMETHING 
WHAT'S THAT CALLED QUAD YES 
ACTION 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I LEFT MY BABY AND IT FEELS SO BAD 
I GUESS MY RACE IS RUN 
SHE'S THE BEST GIRL THAT I'VE EVER HAD 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE 
HOW'S THAT IT'S LOOKING GOOD TO ME 
SHALL WE GIVE MORE HEADROOM THAN WE NORMALLY WOULD 
WELL THE THING IS GOING TO COME INTO THE SHOT 
I TAKE IT YOU WANNA POP IT IN THERE DO YOU 
IT'LL COME DOWN AS WE ARE RUNNING ALONG IT'S GONNA HIT THE DECK 
HA HA HA 
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE FINISHED SEQUENCE YET 
THEY COULD MAKE THE CLAW LOOK DECIDEDLY UNTHREATENING 
IN WHICH CASE I'M RUNNING FOR MY LIFE AWAY FROM SOME FAIRGROUND GRABBER 
AND FOR TODAY'S SHOOT CAST AND CREW READY THEMSELVES FOR SOME ROUGH AND TUMBLE 
IT LOOKS QUITE FLASH TO ME 
DAVID HAS TO FALL OVER SOME BARRELS LATER AND FALL DOWN 
HE'S VERY GOOD AT ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
ANYTHING PHYSICAL HE'S GREAT ON 
PAD HIM UP AND WE'LL GET HIM TO DO IT 
IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS' 
I WASN'T DOUBLED FOR ANYTHING IT WAS REALLY JUST THROWING YOURSELF AROUND WHICH I ALWAYS QUITE ENJOY 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE LAW WON 
I FOUGHT THE LAW AND THE 
CUT 
STILL LOVED IT OF COURSE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THERE'S BEEN UPS AND DOWNS WHEN THE OOD ARE AROUND 
WE SHOULD FIND OUT WHO'S IN CHARGE 
OH RIGHT HELLO SORRY ERM I WAS JUST SAYING ER NICE PLACE 
WE MUST FEED 
FIRST TIME WE MET THE OOD 
THEY WERE INTRODUCED ON THE IMPOSSIBLE PLANET AS A SLAVE RACE 
YOUR REFRESHMENT OH YEAH THANKS 
THEY'RE SLAVES THE PEOPLE WHO COOK THE FOOD AND DO ALL THE PHYSICAL LABOUR 
I'M SORRY WHAT WAS YOUR NAME 
WE HAVE NO TITLES 
WE ARE AS ONE 
WE NEVER FOUND OUT MUCH ABOUT THEM 
THEY WERE SORT OF MILDLY TELEPATHIC 
ALL IDENTICAL 
HAPPY TO SERVE WHICH IS A VERY ODD AND STRANGE THING 
THAT'S TOUCHED ON FLEETINGLY DURING THE IMPOSSIBLE PLANET AND THE SATAN PIT 
BUT WE NEVER REALLY GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT 
SO I ALWAYS FELT THERE WAS A LOT MORE TO BE EXPLAINED ABOUT THEM 
IT'S INTERESTING FROM THE DOCTOR'S POINT OF VIEW THIS STORY 
BECAUSE HE HAS TO CONFESS THAT HE KIND OF IGNORED THE OOD THE LAST TIME 
ADMITTEDLY THERE WERE GREATER THINGS NEEDING TO BE SORTED OUT LIKE THE DEVIL 
I ACCEPT THAT YOU EXIST 
I DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT WHAT YOU ARE BUT YOUR PHYSICAL EXISTENCE I GIVE YOU THAT 
HE HAS TO LOOK TO HIS OWN SHORTCOMINGS A LITTLE BIT 
HE CONFESSES THAT THE LAST TIME HE MET THE OOD HE DIDN'T REALLY FIND OUT ANYTHING ABOUT THEM 
HE JUST TREATED THEM AS SLAVES IN THE SAME WAY THAT EVERYBODY ELSE DID 
I COULDN'T SAVE THE OOD 
I ONLY HAD TIME FOR ONE TRIP 
THEY WENT DOWN WITH THE PLANET 
THERE'S ALWAYS A DANGER THAT YOU BRING STUFF BACK 
JUST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN IN THERE BEFORE 
AND ISN'T IT FUN JUST TO HAVE A REAPPEARANCE FROM OLD MONSTERS OR CHARACTERS 
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU ONLY DO THAT WHEN THERE IS A STORY TO TELL 
WHEN I READ THIS STORY 
I REALISED WHAT A SUPERB GROUP OF CHARACTERS THEY REALLY WERE 
ONCE YOU HAD THE FIT ONES THE WELL ONES 
OR ONCE THEIR WORLD HAD BEEN PUT RIGHT 
WHAT A FANTASTIC TRIBE OF PEOPLE 
BRILLIANT OR RACE OF PEOPLE 
AS THE TENTACLES RETURN 
THE PRODUCTION TEAM AT LAST GET TO REACQUAINT THEMSELVES 
WITH AN OOLD FRIEND 
HERE THEY COME THE BEAUTIFUL ONES 
THE BEAUTIFUL ONES 
LA LA LA LA 
HERE THEY COME THE BEAUTIFUL ONES 
THE BEAUTIFUL ONES 
LA LA LA LA LA 
TODAY WE ARE FILMING IN SAINT ATHAN AIRBASE 
WALES 
AS A SORT OF UM IT'S LIKE AN ULTIMATE BATTERY FARM FOR OODS 
EACH CONTAINER IS CRAMMED IN WITH SLAVE OODS 
MYSELF AND THE DOCTOR DISCOVER THIS 
I SHOULD SAY THE DOCTOR AND MYSELF REALLY 
AND I GET SHOVED IN WITH THEM 
WHEN HE PUTS HIS HAND ON YOUR BACK DON'T ACTUALLY 
GIVE A GENTLE PUSH 
YOU GO FORWARD QUITE QUICKLY 
JUST DO THAT ONCE MORE 
AILSA IS OUR CHOREOGRAPHER AND A FRIEND OF THE PROGRAMME AS WELL 
SHE'S SO LOVELY AND SUPPORTIVE AND WONDERFUL 
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE EVERY NEW RACE AND CREATURE WE COME ACROSS THEY HAVE TO BE CHOREOGRAPHED 
OTHERWISE YOU GET EXTRAS STUMBLING AROUND LIKE BLOKES COMING OUT OF THE PUB 
AND LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT 
IT'S GOOD FUN TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE OODS BACK AGAIN 
VERY NICE CHARACTER TO WORK WITH BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER QUITE SURE 
WHO WHERE THEY HAVE COME FROM WHAT THEIR EVOLUTION IS 
BUT THIS TIME WE GET MORE OF AN INSIGHT INTO THE OODS BECAUSE WE SEE NOT JUST THE OODS 
BUT WE SEE THE NATURAL OODS WHO SLOWLY REVEAL 
OPENING THEIR HANDS YOU SEE THEIR LITTLE HIND BRAIN 
YOU GET TO KNOW MORE THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED 
TO THESE PEOPLE OVER A PERIOD OF ABOUT TWO CENTURIES 
THERE'S SOMETHING SO ALIEN ABOUT THEM 
THEY'RE JUST CRYING OUT FOR A BIT OF HISTORY I THINK 
IS THAT 
IT'S A BRAIN A HIND BRAIN 
THE MOVEMENT OF THE BASIC OOD HASN'T REALLY CHANGED 
THEY STILL HAVE THE SAME PRESENCE THE SAME CALMNESS 
AND THE SAME WALKING MOVEMENT 
THEY'RE VERY DISTINCTIVE AND VERY DIFFERENT 
COS THEY'RE NOT A DOCTOR WHO MONSTER 
IN THAT THEY'RE NOT RAMPAGING AND CHOMPING AND DESTROYING AS ALIENS OFTEN ARE 
THERE'S A REAL SLOWNESS AND PRECISION TO THE OOD THAT IS VERY VERY CAREFULLY WORKED OUT 
THE GUYS IN THE SUITS WORK VERY HARD AT DOING THAT 
ACTION 
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE SHEER ANGER COMING OUT AND THE FRUSTRATION OF THE OOD 
WITH THE RUNNING OOD OR THE RABID OOD 
SO WE'VE GOT A REALLY NICE CONTRAST 
THEY DON'T JUST WALK CALMLY 
YOU'RE SEEING A WHOLE BETTER DIMENSION OF THEM 
DOCTOR DONNA FRIENDS THE CYCLE MUST BE BROKEN IT MUST BE BROKEN 
DOCTOR DONNA FRIENDS BROKEN BROKEN 
DOCTOR DONNA FRIENDS THE CYCLE MUST BE BROKEN 
DOCTOR DONNA FRIENDS 
THE THOUGHT OF THEM JUST SLOWLY WANDERING THROUGH YOUR BRAIN IS RATHER SEDUCTIVE 
SCIENCE FICTION PROGRAMMES END UP WITH SOME KIND OF TELEPATHY MIND READING EMPATHY 
WITH TROY AND STAR TREK AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT'S VERY SHORTHAND IT'S A GREAT PLOT DEVICE ACTUALLY 
IT GENERATES HUGE AMOUNTS OF MATERIAL 
MATERIAL WHICH IS FREQUENTLY ON THE DOCTOR'S MIND 
HOLD THE SOLDIERS BACK 
GO INTO THE PAST 
SUP THE FLESH 
STOP THE HEART 
YOU WILL DIE AND I WILL LIVE 
THE TALL ONE HE CALLS US MAD 
THEN HE IS A STRANGER TO POMPEII 
CONNECTION BY ELASTICA 
RIDING ON ANY WAVE THERE IS THE LUCK YOU CRAVE 
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT NOW 
THEY JUST THINK IT'S STUPID 
SO GOT ANYTHING 
ANYONE COULD HAVE DONE 
WHO WOULD'VE CARED AT ALL NOT YOU 
HOW DID YOU DO THAT 
BURN WITH ME 
FORGET IT FORGET IT FORGET IT 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW A HEART IS A SPADE 
BUT SOMEHOW THE VITAL CONNECTION IS MADE 
HE IS AWAKE 
AND YOU WILL WORSHIP HIM 
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND HIS TARDIS 
BLOOD CONTROL BLOOD CONTROL 
OH I HAVEN'T SEEN BLOOD CONTROL FOR YEARS 
GOD I'M A CHAV 
RIDING ON ANYTHING ANYTHING'S GOOD ENOUGH 
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT IT OF SOMEONE LIKE YOU 
JUST AS THEY BROUGHT ME ROUND NOW THAT THEY BROUGHT YOU DOWN 
ROUNDABOUT AND ROUNDABOUT WHO WANTS A LIFE ANYWAY 
ANOTHER HEART HAS MADE THE GRADE 
FORGET IT FORGET IT FORGET IT 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE LAST CARD IS PLAYED 
BUT SOMEHOW THE VITAL CONNECTION IS MADE 
I AM THE MASTER 
OPEN YOUR MIND 
HERE COME THE DRUMS 
ACTIVATE 
AH TWO HEARTS 
OH BABY I'M BEATING OUT A SAMBA 
ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IS STOP THEM THINKING 
IT'S SOMETHING BEYOND OUR UNDERSTANDING 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT FASCINATES AND SLIGHTLY TERRIFIES US 
SO THAT ALWAYS PROVIDES GOOD MATERIAL FOR SCIENCE FICTION 
FANTASY TYPE STORY LINES 
IT SEEMS TO FIT THE OOD SOMEHOW THEY'RE SO BENEVOLENT AND NON INVASIVE 
THEY'RE FANTASTIC CHARACTERS AND THOSE MASKS ARE AMAZING 
THEY'RE A REAL UNIQUE DESIGN AND THEY'RE SO SQUEEZABLE 
THOSE HEADS YOU JUST WANT TO BITE THEM 
THEY ARE SO LOVELY THE OOD 
I REALLY DO THINK THEY ARE SO LOVELY 
AND IT'S ODD BECAUSE THEY LOOK LIKE NOTHING ON EARTH 
I THINK THEY'RE A GREAT DESIGN I THINK THEY'RE A FANTASTIC DESIGN 
THERE'S A HEART TO THEM A GENTLENESS TO THEM 
IT'S A REALLY WEIRD THING I THOUGHT THEY'D BE A BIT LIKE 
THEY'VE GOT THIS SORT OF UNCOOKED SAUSAGE MEAT COMING OUT OF THEIR FACE 
BUT THEY'RE NOT ALSO PAUL KASEY 
WHO ALWAYS PLAYS THE KIND OF HERO ALIEN HE'S VERY IN TUNE WITH IT 
THE FIRST LOOK OF THE OOD 
YOU LOOK AT THEM AND GO UGH BECAUSE OF THE TENTACLES 
BUT AS YOU GET TO SEE THEM MORE WITHIN THE EPISODE 
AND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OODS ESPECIALLY THE NATURAL OODS 
I THINK YOU TEND TO LOVE THEM THAT LITTLE BIT MORE 
THEY'RE SORT OF A BIT MORE 
YOU'D WANT ONE REALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE SO NICE 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WELCOME TO OODSPHERE ISN'T IT BRACING 
HERE ARE YOUR INFORMATION PACKS WITH VOUCHERS 
THREE D. TICKETS AND A MAP OF THE COMPLEX 
THEY LOOK QUITE MENACING WITH THE TENTACLES 
AND THE BIG HEAD AND STUFF 
BUT THOSE GUYS CAN HARDLY SEE IN THERE 
THEY CAN'T HEAR YOU SO YOU HAVE TO HELP THEM OVER THINGS 
SO WHEN THEY'RE WALKING TOWARDS PEOPLE TRYING TO KILL THEM 
AND YOU'D CUT AND THEY'D BE BUMPING INTO WALLS 
IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY 
AS AN ANIMATRONIC HEAD IT'S QUITE A SIMPLE PUT ON REALLY 
THEY GO ON QUITE QUICK 
WITH THE ANIMATRONICS 
WHEN THEY'RE RUNNING SOMETIMES IF THE DIALOGUE IS QUITE QUIET 
A QUIET SCENE OR SOMETHING'S BEING WHISPERED 
THEN I CAN'T HEAR SO I TEND TO HAVE TO BE CUED 
YOU KNOW WHEN TO TALK AND WHEN MY DIALOGUE IS 
OR WHEN I'M TO MAKE A MOVE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT A LOT OF THE TIME I CAN HEAR 
ONCE EVERYTHING'S MOVING WITHIN THE HEAD 
YOU KNOW ALL THE EXPRESSIONS ARE COMING OUT 
THE PUPPETEER WILL JUST BE A LITTLE BLINK GOING ON 
MAYBE A LITTLE MOVEMENT 
IF YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE'S FACES THEY'RE ALWAYS ALIVE 
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING BLINKING LITTLE TWITCHES MOUTH MOVES 
THE TRICK WITH PUPPETEERING IS ALWAYS HAVE THE FACE ACTIVE 
SO HE CAN REALLY LOOK SURPRISED FURROW HIS BROW 
GET ANGRY SYMPATHETIC WHATEVER 
YOU JUST BUILD A RANGE OF MOVEMENTS 
IT'S THE SAME CONTROL THAT YOU'D USE TO FLY A PLANE 
MODEL HELICOPTER OR A CAR 
SO WE'RE JUST USING IT FOR CREATURES INSTEAD 
IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU'RE NEXT TO ONE YOU HEAR THIS WHIRRING MECHANISM INSIDE 
IT'S SOMETIMES DISTRACTING BUT IT'S GREAT COS IT'S VERY CONVINCING 
I'M CONVINCED THERE'S MORE BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE ANIMATRONIC GUY 
IF UPDATING THE OOD FOR ANOTHER OUTING DIDN'T SEND CHILLS UP THE SPINES OF THE DESIGN TEAM 
THEY ALSO FACED A COOL CHALLENGE REALISING THE ICE PLANET 
THIS IS BARMY I WAS BORN IN CHISWICK 
I'VE ONLY EVER DONE PACKAGE HOLIDAYS AND NOW I'M HERE THIS IS 
I MEAN IT'S 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S ALL SORT OF 
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE WORD IS 
OH I'VE GOT THE WORD 
FREEZING 
SNOW 
AH REAL SNOW PROPER SNOW AT LAST 
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT LOVELY WHAT DO YOU THINK BIT COLD 
MILLIONS OF PLANETS IN MILLIONS OF GALAXIES AND WE'RE ON THIS ONE 
MOLTO BENE BELLISSIMO 
YOU SAID IT DONNA BORN IN CHISWICK 
YOU'VE HAD A LIFE OF WORK AND SLEEP 
TELLY RENT TAX TAKEAWAY DINNERS 
BIRTHDAYS CHRISTMAS AND TWO WEEKS' HOLIDAY 
THEN YOU END UP HERE 
DONNA NOBLE CITIZEN OF THE EARTH STANDING ON A DIFFERENT PLANET 
HOW ABOUT THAT DONNA 
DONNA 
SORRY YOU WERE SAYING BETTER 
LOVELY THANKS COMFY YEP 
CAN YOU HEAR ANYTHING INSIDE THAT PARDON 
ICE PLANET IS ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE SCIENCE FICTION STAPLES ACTUALLY 
AND QUITE EASILY DONE 
A QUARRY A SNOW MACHINE A BIT OF WHITE PAINT 
I SAY IT'S EASY PEOPLE SLAVED NIGHT AND DAY OVER IT 
WE HAD A COMPANY WHO SPRAYED A WHOLE AREA 
A SMALL AREA OF THE TOP OF A QUARRY 
LET IT SNOW 
OH THE WEATHER OUTSIDE IS FRIGHTFUL 
BUT THE FIRE IS SO DELIGHTFUL 
AND SINCE WE'VE NO PLACE TO GO 
LET IT SNOW LET IT SNOW LET IT SNOW 
MAN IT DOESN'T SHOW SIGNS OF STOPPING 
AND I'VE BROUGHT ME SOME CORN FOR POPPING 
THE LIGHTS ARE TURNED WAY DOWN LOW 
LET IT SNOW LET IT SNOW 
TODAY WE'RE DRESSING THE ICE PLANE SCENE 
AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND 
THERE'S PAPER SNOW GOING DOWN 
THERE'S A FINE SPRAY OF WATER WHICH GOES DOWN FIRST 
THEN PAPER SNOW IS BLOWN ON TOP OF THAT 
WHICH MAKES IT ADHERE A BIT BETTER 
IT'S A FAIRLY FAST PROCESS AS YOU CAN SEE 
WE'RE UP AT THE TREFIL QUARRY ON THE EDGE OF THE BRECON BEACONS 
AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME 
WE'VE SPRAYED A LOT OF IT WITH SNOW 
FOR THE OPENING SCENE SCENE FOUR WHERE THE TARDIS ARRIVES 
WE HAD THE MOST FANTASTIC SUMMER DAY BLUE SKIES VERY PLEASANT AND WARM 
WITH SNOW LANDSCAPE IT WAS REALLY PECULIAR 
ONE OF THE QUIRKS OF FILMING IS WHEN YOU'RE MEANT TO BE HOT 
IT'S FREEZING COLD AND WHENEVER YOU'RE MEANT TO BE COLD 
THE SUN IS BEATING DOWN 
IT'S AMAZING HOW ONCE THAT TURNS WHITE 
IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL THING IT MAKES YOU FEEL COLD 
AND IT SHOULD LOOK QUITE GOOD WITH THE FALLING SNOW 
IT WILL LOOK FAIRLY REALISTIC 
IT REALLY DID LOOK LIKE YOU WERE SOMEWHERE COLD AN ALPINE PLACE 
WEIRDLY ENOUGH HALF THE CREW GOT SUNBURNT THAT DAY 
BECAUSE OF THE BOUNCE OF THE SNOW 
A ROCKET 
BLIMEY A REAL PROPER ROCKET 
I'M AFRAID THERE ARE PROBABLY QUITE A FEW SHOTS IN THAT EPISODE 
WHERE CATHERINE AND I ARE SQUINTING OUT AT THE OOD IN FRONT OF US 
THAT WAS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WITH IT JUST NOT BEING BLINDED 
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL A SPACESHIP 
YOU'VE GOT A BOX HE'S GOT A FERRARI 
LET'S SEE WHERE HE'S GOING 
THIS IS DONNA'S FIRST TRIP TO ANOTHER PLANET 
WHEREAS WE'VE SEEN HER BEFORE GO BACK IN TIME BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN HER GO TO ANOTHER WORLD 
SHE FINDS IT DIFFICULT I THINK 
I THINK IT'S REALLY QUITE SHOCKING AS IT WOULD BE FOR ALL OF US 
WHAT IS IT 
AN OOD HE'S CALLED AN OOD 
BUT HIS FACE 
DONNA DON'T NOT NOW IT'S A HE NOT AN IT 
GIVE ME A HAND 
DONNA'S REACTION TO THE OOD IS BRILLIANT COS IT'S LIKE 
SHE'S SO HONEST 
WHEN SHE FIRST SEES THEM SHE'S HORRIFIED 
NOT ONLY IS SHE HORRIFIED SHE'S QUITE FREAKED OUT 
THEY'RE NOT NICE LOOKING FROM A HUMAN POINT OF VIEW 
YOU'RE GONNA COME LIKE THE CLAPPERS AREN'T YOU 
DO IT FROM THERE FOR THE MOMENT DAVE AND WHEN WE SHOOT IT 
COME ROUND THE CORNER AND CATHERINE 
ACTION 
WHAT IS IT AN OOD HE'S CALLED AN OOD 
BUT HIS FACE DONNA DON'T NOT NOW 
IT'S A HE NOT AN IT GIVE ME A HAND 
SHE'S THERE TO DO THE CLUMSY THINGS WE'D ALL DO 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
DESIGNATED OOD DELTA FIFTY 
MY NAME'S DONNA 
NO NO NO NO NO YOU DON'T NEED TO SORRY 
OH GOD 
DONNA PRESUMES THAT TO SPEAK TO IT 
YOU HAVE TO USE THAT TRANSLATOR BALL 
SHE PICKS UP THE BALL AND TALKS INTO IT WHICH IS A TERRIBLE FAUX PAS 
IN FRONT OF SOMEONE WHO'S DYING I BELIEVE YOU'D DO THAT 
FACE VALUE IT'S A SHOCKER INNIT 
SEEING THAT LYING IN THE SNOW WITH PURPLE BLOOD 
IT IT'S NOT NICE 
DONNA'S REACTION IS NOT RARE 
WHEN YOU'RE WITH THE DOCTOR IT CAN BE HARD TO BELIEVE YOUR EYES 
HE'S BLUE YEAH 
THE RAIN IS GOING UP 
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
THE LIQUID ROSE IT CAN TALK 
RUN 
WHAT IS THAT 
OVER THERE 
RIGHT I'VE GOT THE JOKE WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS 
IT'S A DIFFERENT PLANET I'M STANDING ON A DIFFERENT PLANET 
OH MY GOD 
HE'S DEAD URRGH ARRGH 
I TELL YOU WHAT THOUGH WHAT 
WEREWOLF I KNOW 
THEY'RE CATS NOW DON'T STARE 
DOCTOR WHAT DID YOU SEE A WITCH 
ROSE NO 
REAL PROPER ALIENS 
OH MY GOD DON'T WORRY YOU'LL GET USED TO IT 
WHERE ARE WE WHAT'S THAT 
IT'S THE FACE OF BOW IT'S ALL RIGHT 
COME AND SAY HELLO 
THEY'RE JUST SO ALIEN 
DONNA GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE THE OOD AS NEW 
BECAUSE VIEWERS MIGHT NOT HAVE SEEN THEM BEFORE 
MIGHT HAVE MISSED THOSE EPISODES FOR SOME REASON 
IT'S A RETURNING MONSTER BUT YOU GET TO PLAY THEM FROM SCRATCH WITH DONNA'S RESPONSE 
IT'S ALL RIGHT WE'VE GOT YOU 
AND SHE IS MYSTIFIED SHE IS FASCINATED 
SHE STARTS QUESTIONING THE OOD MORE CLOSELY THAN THE DOCTOR'S EVER DONE 
WHAT ARE THE RED DOTS OOD DISTRIBUTION CENTRES 
ACROSS THREE GALAXIES 
DON'T THE OOD GET A SAY IN THIS 
THE DOCTOR TAKES THEM FOR GRANTED IN A WAY 
HE'S INTERESTED IN A DEAD OOD AND A MURDER SOMETHING'S GOING ON 
IT'S DONNA WHO ASKS THEM WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS 
WHAT'S GOING ON HOW CAN YOU BE LIKE THAT 
ARE THERE ANY FREE OOD 
ARE THERE OOD RUNNING WILD SOMEWHERE LIKE WILDEBEEST 
YOU KNOW YOU JUST FEEL THESE SHIFTS GOING IN DONNA'S MINDSET 
THAT SHE'S OPEN TO AND THAT'S THE GREAT THING SHE'S OPEN TO THEM 
SHE LEARNS SYMPATHY FOR THEM AS IT GOES ON 
FROM OUR FIRST REACTION OF OH MY GOD THAT'S SO UGLY 
TO ACTUALLY CRYING FOR THEM WEEPING 
TAKE IT AWAY 
SURE I CAN'T BEAR IT 
SHE FINDS GREAT YOU KNOW EMPATHY AND COMPASSION WITH THEM 
SHE'S PROPERLY DISGUSTED BY WHAT SHE DISCOVERS GOING ON IN THE CAGES 
AND QUITE RIGHT TOO 
I THINK SHE'S QUITE GOOD AT REMINDING THE DOCTOR 
OF THE COST OF THINGS POSSIBLY 
A GREAT BIG EMPIRE BUILT ON SLAVERY 
IT'S NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM YOUR TIME O. I. I HAVEN'T GOT SLAVES 
WHO DO YOU THINK MADE YOUR CLOTHES 
IS THAT WHY YOU TRAVEL ROUND WITH A HUMAN AT YOUR SIDE 
IT'S NOT SO YOU CAN SHOW THEM THE WONDERS OF THE UNIVERSE 
IT'S SO YOU CAN TAKE CHEAP SHOTS SORRY WELL DON'T 
SPACEMAN 
SHE'S A VERY GROUNDING INFLUENCE ON THE DOCTOR 
AND EVERYONE AROUND HER REALLY 
WHICH IS PART OF THAT NEW DYNAMIC I THINK BETWEEN THE TWO CHARACTERS 
WHICH ALLOWS US TO SEE A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF THE DOCTOR AS WELL 
AS A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF WHAT IT IS TO TRAVEL WITH THE DOCTOR 
SHE DOESN'T HAVE THAT FILTER OF HUGE YOU KNOW 
ROSE COLOURED GLASSES ABOUT HIM 
DO SOMETHING YOU'RE THE ONE WITH ALL THE TRICKS 
YOU MUST HAVE MET HOUDINI THESE ARE REALLY GOOD HANDCUFFS 
OH I'M GLAD OF THAT AT LEAST WE'VE GOT QUALITY 
I DO THINK THEY GET ON AND THERE'S AN EASY BANTER 
AND A CAMARADERIE 
SERVANTS THEY'RE SLAVES 
GET UP 
MARCH 
LAST TIME I MET THE OOD I NEVER THOUGHT NEVER ASKED 
THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU I WAS BUSY 
SO BUSY I COULDN'T SAVE THEM I HAD TO LET THE OOD DIE 
I RECKON I OWE THEM ONE 
THE VERY FACT THAT SHE BRINGS UP THE FACT THAT 
YOU MET THE OOD BEFORE BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS GOING ON 
THAT SHAMES HIM A LITTLE BIT AND THAT'S A NICE NEW DYNAMIC 
THAT THE DOCTOR'S NOT BEING SIMPLY LOOKED UP TO 
AND SIMPLY INVESTED IN 
SHE'S CHALLENGING HIM 
AND THAT ALLOWS BOTH THE CHARACTERS TO REACT IN QUITE INTERESTING WAYS 
AND IT'S NOT ONLY HIS COMPANION THAT'S CHALLENGING 
NO ONE KNOWS BY QUEENS OF THE STONEAGE 
I SAID NO ALARMS 
MY CHARACTER IS CALLED HALPEN 
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY THE NAME OF A VILLAIN IT'S VERY CLEAR 
HOW MANY DEAD FACTS AND FIGURES 
I HAVEN'T FLOWN ALL THIS WAY TO DISCUSS THE WEATHER WHICH IS FREEZING 
I OWN THE FRANCHISE FOR SELLING OODS DOMESTICALLY ACROSS THE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN GALAXY 
HALPEN'S A BUSINESSMAN A NICE MIDDLE LEVEL DOCTOR WHO VILLAIN 
WHAT I MEAN IS HE'S NOT OUT TO TAKE OVER THE UNIVERSE 
HE'S A MANAGEMENT BODY 
HE'S DOING HIS JOB AND HE'S MAKING A PROFIT 
WHICH WE SORT OF USE A LOT OF IN DOCTOR WHO 
I THINK IT'S CLOSER TO TRUE LIFE VILLAINY 
THE OOD ARE BORN WITH SECONDARY BRAIN 
LIKE THE AMYGDALA IN HUMANS IT PROCESSES MEMORY AND EMOTIONS 
WITHOUT THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE DONNA YOU'D BE LIKE A PROCESSED OOD 
SO THE COMPANY CUTS OFF THEIR BRAINS 
AND THEY STITCH ON THE TRANSLATOR 
THEY WEREN'T BEING TREATED VERY WELL AT ALL EN MASSE AND WHAT APPEARS 
TO BE A VERY WONDERFUL FRONT OF A FANTASTIC BUSINESS IT ACTUALLY WASN'T 
IT WAS SOMETHING RATHER SEEDY AND NASTY GOING ON 
REALLY APROPOS TO BATTERY HEN FARMING IF YOU LIKE 
WE'VE DONE TERRIBLE THINGS TO THE OOD 
TO TURN THEM INTO SLAVES IN THE FIRST PLACE 
SO HE'S NOT A VERY NICE MAN 
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
IT'S JUST A FIRE DRILL 
WE TEST THE SYSTEM AT THIS TIME EVERY DAY 
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME 
SHE'S A MARKETING MANAGER FOR THE OOD 
AND I THINK SHE'S ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT FOLLOWS THE RULES 
SHE KNOWS SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY WHEN SHE MEETS THE DOCTOR 
SHE REALISES THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS REALLY AWFUL 
BUT SHE SOMEHOW DOESN'T STEP OUT OF HER JOB 
COME WITH ME YOU'VE SEEN THE WAREHOUSE 
YOU CAN'T AGREE WITH ALL THIS 
YOU KNOW THIS PLACE BETTER THAN ME YOU COULD HELP 
THEY'RE OVER HERE GUARDS THEY'RE OVER HERE 
SHE DOESN'T FOLLOW WHAT SHE THINKS IS RIGHT 
SHE SORT OF KEEPS DOING HER JOB 
COME ON THINK FOR YOURSELF BUT SHE NEVER DOES 
SHE LETS HERSELF DOWN THE AUDIENCE DOWN THE DOCTOR DOWN SHE'S DOOMED 
SHOOT THEM SHOOT TO KILL 
SHE DESERVED TO DIE I THINK IN THE SIMPLE MORALS OF DOCTOR WHO 
THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF A FAMILY RUN BUSINESS DOCTOR RYDER 
THE PERSONAL TOUCH WE CAN GET TO THE ROCKET 
NO NEED WE'VE GOT THIS 
DETONATION PACKS PLACE THEM AROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE 
WE'RE GOING TO BLOW IT UP 
WE HAD A LOT OF FUN WORKING OUT THE SECRET OPERATIVE OF FRIENDS OF THE OOD 
WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES TO RELEASE THE OOD IT IS DOCTOR RYDER 
WE TRIED TO HIDE IT BY WRITING IT DOWN IT'S A LOVELY PERFORMANCE 
BECAUSE HE'S A FUSSY MAN IN A WHITE COAT HE BLENDS INTO THE BACKGROUND AND IT'S DELIBERATE 
AND THEN WE FIND HE SPENT TEN YEARS DOING THIS AND GETS MURDERED 
AFTER A DECADE OF DISCREET DEALINGS WITH THE OOD DOCTOR RYDER FINALLY GETS HIS MOMENT 
BUT SADLY FOR HIM ON SET TODAY HIS MOMENT IS BEING MURDERED 
BEING A FRIEND OF THE OOD HAS MADE HIM AN ENEMY OF HALPEN 
THE PLAN IS THAT JAMES O'DEE 
OUR STUNT DOUBLE HE'S DOUBLING DOCTOR RYDER 
HE GETS THROWN BY HALPEN OVER T. H. E. B. A. L. C. ON Y. 
AND IS GOING TO DROP PROBABLY ABOUT TWELVE FEET 
TWELVE OR TEN FEET BEFORE HE HITS THE CARDBOARD BOX RIG WE'RE GOING TO BUILD FOR HIM 
THE ACTOR WILL DO THE BEGINNING OF THE FALL SO HE'LL START TO LEAN OVER THE BALCONY AS HALPEN 
THROWS HIM AND THEN JAMES WILL DO THE MIDDLE BIT 
WE'LL SHOOT FROM BELOW AND WE'LL SEE JAMES FALL DOWN TOWARDS CAMERA 
AND THEN WE'LL CUT TO THE ACTOR ON THE WIRE RIG 
WHEN IT'S ALL PUT TOGETHER IT SHOULD LOOK QUITE SPECTACULAR 
I HAVE TO MATCH WHAT THE ACTOR'S DOING 
SO WE'LL WATCH PRETTY CLOSELY TO SEE HOW HE EXITS OVER THE TOP 
THEN TRY AND GO ONTO THE BOX ON MY BACK 
IT IS GREAT TO FALL ONTO CARDBOARD BOXES BECAUSE THEY BREAK YOUR FALL GRADUALLY 
THE IDEA IS YOU SINK INTO THEM 
WE ARE BUILDING THOSE UP TYING THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPE 
THERE ARE CRASH MATS AT THE BASE SO THAT IF HE GOES THROUGH THE BOXES HE HAS A SOFT LANDING 
I FEEL FINE ABOUT IT 
IT'S QUITE A BASIC FALL BUT IT DOESN'T DETRACT 
FROM HAVING TO BE FOCUSED WHILE DOING IT 
THE PROCESS IS TOO SLOW 
IT HAD TO BE ACCELERATED I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN YOU ACCESS TO THE CONTROLS 
I LOWERED THE BARRIER TO ITS MINIMUM 
FRIENDS OF THE OOD 
IT'S TAKEN ME TEN YEARS TO INFILTRATE THE COMPANY 
AND I SUCCEEDED YES 
YES YOU DID 
DIDN'T WORK FOR ME 
IT WENT REALLY WELL I WAS THRILLED TO BITS 
WE DID IT IN ONE TAKE AND HE WAS IN THE PERFECT POSITION 
AND HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF OVER THE RAIL ON THE GANTRY 
STRAIGHT ONTO HIS BACK 
STAYED ON HIS BACK LANDED SPOT ON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOXES SUPERB 
YOU MURDERED HIM VERY OBSERVANT GINGER 
THE DEATH OF DOCTOR RYDER IS VERY IMPORTANT 
OR HALPEN WOULDN'T QUITE DESERVE WHAT'S COMING TO HIM HALPEN'S FATE IS DISGUSTING 
HOW'S THE HAIR LOSS MR. HALPEN 
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE 
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY GOTHIC ABOUT THE ENDING OF THIS EPISODE 
THE FACT THAT HALPEN IS TRANSFORMED INTO THE VERY CREATURE HE'S BEEN ABUSING 
HE IS FORCED TO WALK IN AN OOD'S SHOES 
ACTUALLY LITERALLY AT THE END 
IT HAS A VERY OLD FASHIONED EDGAR ALLEN POE FEEL TO IT 
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY SATISFYING ABOUT THAT 
WE HAD A RATHER AMAZING PROSTHETIC HEADPIECE MADE UP FOR TIM 
MADE TO MEASURE KIND OF HEADPIECE 
NOT ONLY DID THEY HAVE TO BUILD AN OOD HEAD ON TOP OF MINE 
BUT THEN ANOTHER VERSION OF ME ON TOP OF THAT 
WELL MY EARS ARE WARM 
IT WAS QUITE SCARY TO SEE ON THE DAY BECAUSE THIS LATEX FOREHEAD 
JUST PEELED AWAY 
IT WAS A GREAT BIT OF PROSTHETICS 
BEING MADE UP FOR THE SHOW'S CLIMAX IS CLEARLY A HEADACHE 
THERE'S A LOT OF GLOOP AND IT'S VERY UNPLEASANT 
IT LOOKED DISGUSTING I LIKE GORY THINGS 
I LIKE MONSTERS ON TELEVISION 
BUT THAT WAS JUST AWFUL WE SAW HIM PEEL AWAY HIS FLESH REVEALING OOD HEAD 
THAT THEN WAS LEFT FLAPPING SO YOU HAVE A HUGE 
WHERE THE SKIN PARTED HE TORE HIS SKIN AWAY 
THERE WERE TWO BIG FLAPS HANGING DOWN 
EVERY TIME I SAW THIS IN RUSHES I COLLAPSED 
IT WAS HORRIFIC AND ALSO QUITE FUNNY VERY FUNNY TO ME 
AN ENDING FITTING FOR THE START 
YOU TWIST AND TORE OUR LOVE APART 
YOUR LIGHT FINGERS THROUGH THE DARK 
SHATTERED THE LAMP INTO THE DARK IT CAST US 
NO YOU'VE GOT IT THE WRONG WAY ROUND 
YOU SHUT ME UP AND BLAMED IT ON THE BROWN 
CORNERED THE BOY KICKED OUT AT THE WORLD 
GRAHAM HARPER WHO DIRECTED THAT EPISODE DID SAY THAT DONNA 
SHOULD REACT TO THAT IN ALL ITS HORROR REALLY 
THERE SHE IS SEEING A HUMAN LITERALLY EMERGING AS ANOTHER FORM 
AND THEN WE GO INTO A SEQUENCE WITH C. G. WHERE WE PUT 
C. G. TENDRILS COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND THEN WE CUT BACK AND HE IS A FULL OOD 
THE RED ONES WILL TRACK THE FACE AND HOLD THE FACE STEADY 
AND THEN ALL OF THE BLUE ONES ARE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MUSCLES 
THAT SHOULD LOCK OUR HEAD STILL 
YOU CAN'T STAND ME NOW 
YOU CAN'T STAND ME NOW YOU CAN'T STAND ME NOW 
YOU CAN'T STAND ME NOW YOU CAN'T STAND ME NOW 
YOU CAN'T STAND ME NOW 
NO YOU CAN'T STAND ME NOW 
BUT DOCTORING D. N. A. DID CAUSE THE CREW SOME DILEMMAS 
THE WAY WE SHOT IT INITIALLY 
WE'RE LOOKING UP AT THE MOUTH 
AND IN THE EDIT 
RUSSELL SAID IF WE HAD THE TENDRILS COMING STRAIGHT TOWARDS CAMERA IT WOULD LOOK LIKE HE WAS BEING SICK 
THIS WAS AFTER THE SHOOT 
IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD IF WE COULD 
AS HE BENDS FORWARD AND DUCKS OUT OF SHOT IF YOU CAN GET A CUT AWAY 
OF JUST THE MOUTH AND ALL THE TENDRILS FALLING OUT 
SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GO FOR THE SIDE A BIT OF PROFILE 
HE JUST GOES LIKE THIS AND WE WILL PUT TENDRILS FALLING OUT 
I ROLE ON DOCTOR WHO HAS THE BEST PART ONE WORK IN THE LIGHTING DEPARTMENT 
IT'S THAT 
I'M A STAND IN HEAD 
TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TAKE ONE 
AND A SORT OF GENTLE MOVE INTO THIS ONE WOULD BE GREAT ACTION 
OPEN THE MOUTH A BIT WIDER AND A BIT MORE MOVEMENT OF THE MOUTH 
IT FEELS QUITE EMBARRASSING 
I'M QUITE A CAMERA SHY PERSON SO I'M NOT USED ALL THIS ATTENTION 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FROM A PROSTHETIC AND SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT KIND OF STANCE IT'S PHENOMENAL 
BUT YEAH IT IS FAIRLY WORRYING 
BEFORE YOUR BEANS ON TOAST I SUPPOSE ON A SATURDAY 
HOPEFULLY IN SCHOOL ON MONDAY MORNING EVERYBODY GOES DID YOU SEE THAT MAN TURN INTO AN OOD 
JOB WELL DONE IF THEY ARE 
THE CIRCLE IS BROKEN THE OOD CAN SING 
EPISODE THREE HAS A REALLY IMPORTANT STORY ABOUT LIBERATING OPPRESSED PEOPLE AND THAT 
IS A METAPHOR WE CAN APPLY ALL AROUND THE WORLD AND DOMESTICALLY 
WHETHER IT IT'S A BIG STORY THAT ONE CAN TAKE PERSONALLY OR TAKE GLOBALLY 
THAT IS WHY DOCTOR WHO IS SO IMPORTANT 
I'M ON THE ROCKY ROAD 
HEADING DOWN OFF THE MOUNTAIN SLOW 
AND MY STEPS ECHO ECHO LOUDER THAN BEFORE 
I THINK IT'S A GREAT STORY THIS ONE 
A GREAT DOCTOR WHO MONSTER GREAT CLASSIC ALIEN PLANET 
REALLY I THINK IT JUST WORKS PERFECTLY 
AS FORGING THE NEW RELATIONSHIP OF THE DOCTOR AND DONNA 
HEAR IT DONNA DOCTOR DONNA FRIENDS 
NICE ONE THANK YOU 
THE OOD CAN SING 
WHEN THE NIGHT 
HEARS MY SOUL 
I'LL BE HOME 
I'LL BE HOME 
NOW THAT THEY ARE FREE IT'S PROBABLY A RATHER LOVELY LIFE 
THEY CAN ALL SING TOGETHER THEY CAN ALL LIVE OUT THEIR DAYS 
SKIPPING THROUGH THE SNOW TOGETHER 
HAVING A LOVELY TELEPATHIC SING SONG 
THE NAME OF DOCTOR DONNA WILL GO OFF IN HISTORY AS BEEN THE MOST WONDERFUL IMPORTANT THING 
IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT THAT THESE FIRST THREE STORIES WITH A NEW COMPANION 
YOU WRITE THEM INTO THE HISTORY OF THE PROGRAMME SO THEY BECOME EMBEDDED 
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT FOR THOSE TWO 
WHEN THE NIGHT FEELS MY SONG 
I'LL BE HOME 
I'LL BE HOME
