CLIMBING ABOARD THE TITANIC FOR AN ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME KYLIE MINOGUE THE ULTIMATE POP PRINCESS 
HAS SWAPPED SELL OUT TOURS FOR SILVER SERVICE 
IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE BLAST 
I REALLY HAD TROUBLE WIPING THE SMILE OFF MY FACE 
SANTA BABY JUST SLIP A SABLE UNDER THE TREE 
FOR ME 
SHE'S AS BIG A LEGEND AS DOCTOR WHO IF NOT BIGGER 
I'VE BEEN AN AWFUL GOOD GIRL 
SANTA BABY SO HURRY DOWN THE CHIMNEY TONIGHT 
FROM HOT PANTS TO HOT WATER JOIN DOCTOR WHO CONFIDENTIAL 
AT CHRISTMAS AS WE SET SAIL BEHIND THE SCENES TO CELEBRATE THE DOCTOR WITH COMPANION KYLIE 
IT SEEMS LIKE A NICE MEETING OF ICONS FOR CHRISTMAS DAY 
HURRY DOWN THE CHIMNEY TONIGHT 
CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE THIS YEAR FOR THE DOCTOR WHO PRODUCTION TEAM 
FILMING BEGAN BACK IN THE SUMMER AND TODAY SUPERSTAR KYLIE IS ON SET 
TO SHOOT ASTRID'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE DESERTED DOCTOR 
IT'S AN UNUSUAL SITUATION TO FIND THE DOCTOR IN WANDERING MOOD AS HE ARRIVES ON THAT SHIP 
HE HAS A MOOCH ABOUT ALL ON HIS OWN AND JOINS IN WITH THE PARTY 
STILL FEELING LIKE AN OUTSIDER 
I LOVE THAT SIDE OF HIM THAT HE TRAVELS AND JOURNEYS 
TO SEE THE WORLD AND EXPERIENCE IT AND YET THAT LEAVES YOU OUTSIDE IT 
YET WITHIN SECONDS HE'S MAKING FRIENDS WITH ASTRID THERE WE GO THANK YOU SIR I CAN MANAGE 
I SUPPOSE AS SOON AS HE'S ON HIS OWN THERE MUST BE PART OF HIM 
THAT'S LOOKING OUT FOR HIS NEXT TRAVELLING COMPANION 
ASTRID TICKS ALL THE BOXES' ASTRID PETH NICE TO MEET YOU MERRY CHRISTMAS 
SHE'S SPUNKY SHE'S UP FOR AN ADVENTURE 
SHE QUICK WITTED AND EASY ON THE EYE WHICH SEEMS TO BE IMPORTANT TO THE DOCTOR 
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT WOULD BE JUST DOCTOR NOT SIR THE DOCTOR AND SHE CLICK WITHIN SECONDS' 
YOU'RE NOT WITH ANYONE NO NO JUST ME ASTRID IS A DREAMER 
SHE'S ALONE HER DREAM IS TO TRAVEL AND IN THE DOCTOR SHE SEES SOMEONE 
WHO'S LIVING THE LIFE SHE'S DREAMT OF 
THERE'S THAT HINT OF POSSIBILITY WHICH I IMAGINED SHE'D LOST FAITH IN 
BACK ON ACTION AND ACTION 
I'VE NEVER STOOD ON ANOTHER WORLD 
I USED TO WATCH THE SHIPS HEADING OUT TO THE STARS 
I ALWAYS DREAMT OH THAT SOUNDS DAFT 
SHE'S DREAMING OF TRAVELLING 
IN A SENSE YOU'D THINK BEING ON THE TITANIC IS TRAVELLING AND YET SHE'S REALLY NOT GETTING ANYWHERE 
IS IT ALL RIGHT IF THE ARTIST'S ALREADY THERE FOR THIS ONE 
WE CAN STILL START IN THE SAME PLACE IN THE DIALOGUE 
AND ACTION 
YOU DREAMT OF ANOTHER SKY 
NEW SUN 
NEW AIR NEW LIFE 
THE WHOLE UNIVERSE TEEMING WITH LIFE 
SHE MEETS THE DOCTOR WHO IS GOING EVERYWHERE AND CHANGE IS HAPPENING ALL THE TIME AND YET HE'S LONELY 
SO YOU TRAVEL A LOT 
ALL THE TIME JUST FOR FUN THAT'S THE PLAN NEVER QUITE WORKS 
ASTRID IS ONE OF THOSE ONE OFF COMPANIONS THAT WE GIVE THE DOCTOR 
SHOULD REPORT YOU 
GO ON THEN SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE A PERFECT COMPANION FOR HIM 
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THEM SAILING OFF INTO THE SUNSET TOGETHER 
YOU CAN IMAGINE ASTRID STAYING WITH THE DOCTOR FOR A LONG TIME 
IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT ALBUM AND INTERNATIONAL TOUR MAYBE SHE'D HAVE HUNG ON A BIT LONGER 
THE KYLIE THING WAS SOMEHOW LUCK IN THE END THAT SORT OF THING 
WE HAD A PRESS LAUNCH FOR SERIES THREE IN LONDON AND WILL BAKER CAME ALONG 
WHO IS KYLIE'S CREATIVE DIRECTOR AND A BIG DOCTOR WHO FAN 
I MET RUSSELL AND JULIETTE AT THE LAUNCH FOR THE LAST SERIES 
THEY OBVIOUSLY WERE AWARE OF ME AND OBVIOUSLY KNEW WHO KYLIE WAS 
HE SAID WOULDN'T IT BE MARVELLOUS IF KYLIE WAS IN AN EPISODE 
TO BE HONEST YOU JUST GO YEAH LIKE THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WE WERE JUST LAUGHING 
WOULDN'T THAT BE BRILLIANT AND PRINCESS MARGARET TOO 
LA LA LA 
LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA 
WITH AN AMAZING FORTY MILLION RECORD SALES UNDER HER SHINY BELT 
GRAMMY AWARD WINNING MISS MINOGUE IS A PINT SIZED POP PHENOMENON 
I JUST CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD 
BOY YOUR LOVING IS ALL I THINK ABOUT 
I JUST CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD 
BOY IT'S MORE THAN I DARE TO THINK ABOUT 
BUT BACK IN THE DAY THIS SEQUINNED SUPERSTAR WAS MUCH MORE AT HOME 
IN AN OILY OVERALL PLAYING GIRL NEXT DOOR CHARLENE MITCHELL 
I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY LUCKY LUCKY LUCKY 
I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY LUCKY LUCKY LUCKY 
I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY IN LOVE 
A NEIGHBOURS WATCHING NATION WAS HOOKED ON THIS TOMBOY'S TWO YEAR RELATIONSHIP 
WITH ON AND OFF SCREEN BOYFRIEND JASON DONOVAN 
ESPECIALLY FOR YOU 
I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH 
ALL THE TIME WE WERE APART I THOUGHT OF YOU 
YOU WERE IN MY HEART 
BUT LOVE NEVER CHANGED 
I STILL FEEL THE SAME 
FOLLOWING HER SOAP SUCCESS THE AUSSIE SONGBIRD 
SOON FLEW TO THE TOP OF THE CHARTS ALL ABOARD THE LOCOMOTION 
EVERYBODY'S DOING A BRAND NEW DANCE NOW 
COME ON BABY DO THE LOCOMOTION 
I KNOW YOU'LL GET TO LIKE IF YOU GIVE IT A CHANCE NOW 
COME ON BABY DO THE LOCOMOTION 
AND TWO DECADES LATER SHE'S ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST SUCCESSFUL ARTISTS 
REGENERATING HER IMAGE ALMOST AS MUCH AS A CERTAIN TIME LORD HAS KEPT KYLIE CLOSE AT HEART 
TWO HEARTS ARE BEATING TOGETHER 
I'M IN LOVE I'M IN LOVE 
IS THIS FOREVER AND EVER 
I'M IN LOVE I'M IN LOVE 
TWO HEARTS 
I THINK I'D AGREED TO IT BEFORE SHE ACTUALLY HAD 
I WAS WORKING AS A WAITRESS IN A COCKTAIL BAR THEN THE NEXT DAY IT WAS REAL 
HE PHONED UP AND JULIE GARDNER IS VERY GOOD AT PURSUING 
HE SAID SHALL WE APPROACH HER 
SIT DOWN WITH HER AND MEET HER AND RUN HER THROUGH THE PLOT 
IT WASN'T EVEN WRITTEN AT THAT STAGE SO I SAT DOWN AND BUSKED IN FRONT OF KYLIE MINOGUE JUST MAKING IT UP 
I CERTAINLY DIDN'T KNOW ASTRID WOULD DIE THEN 
SO I HOPE SHE DIDN'T THINK I CHEATED HER INTO THAT 
THEY LOOK GREAT WE'VE GOT IT ARE WE DONE WITH JIMMY NOW WE'RE DONE WITH JIMMY THANK YOU JIMMY 
THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH 
THE REFRESHING DIFFERENCE FOR ME IS THAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME 
IT'S ABOUT MY CHARACTER AND THE ENSEMBLE 
I GUESS IT JUST GOES BACK TO MY ROOTS OF WHERE I STARTED OUT 
BEING ON SET AND BEING WITH THE CREW IT'S REALLY BEEN ENJOYABLE 
I'VE LOVED IT SO FAR I'M SORE I'M TIRED 
I JUST WASHED THE DIRT AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF OFF ME 
IT'S GREAT HAPPY TO BE HERE 
WE'RE SHOOTING THE TITANIC AND KYLIE AND DAVID FOR THE CHRISTMAS SPECIAL 
DAVID IS A VERY ICONIC DOCTOR I THINK 
KYLIE'S OBVIOUSLY A HUGE ICON AS WELL 
I JUST WANTED 
TO CAPTURE THEIR ENERGY AND THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THEM 
THOUGHT THAT I WAS GOING CRAZY 
JUST HAVING ONE OF THOSE DAYS YEAH 
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
THEN THERE WAS YOU 
AND EVERYTHING WENT FROM WRONG TO RIGHT 
AND THE STARS CAME OUT AND FILLED UP THE SKY 
THE MUSIC YOU WERE PLAYING REALLY BLEW MY MIND 
IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT 
THE CHARACTER OF THE DOCTOR AND HOW HE REGENERATES AND HAS 
ALL THESE INCARNATIONS THAT ARE VERY STYLISTICALLY DIFFERENT 
IS SIMILAR TO HOW A SUCCESSFUL MODERN POP STAR EVOLVES THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREER 
WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT INCARNATIONS THAT KYLIE HAS HAD 
THERE'S SUCH A RICH VISUAL HISTORY TO DRAW FROM I THINK THAT'S REALLY AT THE CORE OF DOCTOR WHO'S SUCCESS 
THERE'S NO LIMIT TO THE PEOPLE'S IMAGINATION INVOLVED IN IT 
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME 
WITH ASTRID'S COSTUME WE MET FOUR TIMES IN TOTAL 
BEFORE WE ACTUALLY STARTED FILMING ON IT 
FOR TOV'S SAKE LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING THIS JACKET'S A GENUINE EARTH ANTIQUE 
I'M SORRY SIR I'D ALREADY HAD QUITE A GOOD BRIEF BECAUSE IN THE SCRIPT SHE'S A WAITRESS 
SO THAT WON'T CHANGE WE DIDN'T WANT TO PUT HER IN SOME LONG DRESS 
YOU DON'T GET KYLIE MINOGUE AND PUT HER IN A LONG FROCK 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE THAT CIGARETTE GIRL SHAPE 
ALMOST LIKE A NINETEEN FIFTIES ICE CREAM CINEMA USHERETTE 
THIS IS AMAZING THANK YOU WE HAD BOOTS MADE FOR HER 
EVERYTHING WE MADE WE HAD TO DO FIVE OF BECAUSE WE HAD TO MAKE FOR HER HER STUNT DOUBLE A STAND IN DOUBLE 
AND ALSO BECAUSE SHE WAS GONNA BE CLEAN AND DIRTY WE HAD TO HAVE THOSE AS WELL 
SO FIVE COSTUMES AND ALSO DIFFERENT SIZED BOOTS 
I MET HER IN SECRET AND I COULDN'T TELL THE PEOPLE MAKING HER BOOTS 
WHO THEY WERE MAKING FOR AND IT WAS ALL VERY CLOAK AND DAGGER 
AND THE SAME WITH OUR COSTUME MAKERS 
WE MADE ALL THE COSTUMES AND NOBODY HAD A WHOLE OUTFIT ON BEFORE THE FIRST DAY 
I THINK LOUISE DID AN AMAZING JOB 
I LOVE THE BOOTS THE BOOTS ARE FANTASTIC 
IN FACT SHE TOLD ME IF WAS ONE OF THE MOST COMFORTABLE COSTUMES SHE'D WORN IN YEARS I WAS VERY PLEASED 
THIS YEAR'S DOCTOR WHO CHRISTMAS SPECIAL NOT ONLY HAD TO LOOK GOOD IT HAD TO SOUND GOOD TOO 
AT THIS LONDON STUDIO COMPOSER MURRAY GOLD 
IS WORKING HIS MAGIC WITH THE MUSIC 
MUSIC'S HUGELY IMPORTANT TO OUR VERSION OF DOCTOR WHO BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE IT AS BIG 
RICH AND POWERFUL AS IT POSSIBLY CAN BE PARTLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD APPROACH TO STORYTELLING 
I'VE DONE THAT ON OTHER DRAMAS 
I'VE WORKED WITH MURRAY ON LOTS OF DRAMAS I THINK IT'S MY FOURTH OR FIFTH TIME WITH HIM HE'S A GENIUS 
IT'S BECOME A BIT OF A TRADITION THAT WE DO A CHRISTMAS NUMBER 
AND WE GOT THE BAND IN BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO GO ABOUT THINGS 
A BIT DIFFERENTLY WHEN YOU'RE RECORDING A SONG 
THE CHRISTMAS EPISODE IS ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY TO THROW EVERYTHING AT IT 
WE HAVE OUR SESSION IN LONDON WITH A BIG BAND TO RECORD THE SONG SO IT'S A REAL TREAT 
IT'S NOT THAT MUCH LOWER I THINK THAT'S THE MIX 
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A CHRISTMAS SONG SINCE SONG FOR TEN 
LAST YEAR WAS LOVE DON'T ROAM THIS YEAR IT'S STOWAWAY 
THERE'S A NICE TRADITION BUILDING 
THE THEME OF IT IS VERY LOOSELY BASED ON VOYAGE OF THE DAMNED 
WHICH HAS GOT A STOWAWAY AT ITS HEART WHO IS THE DOCTOR 
SO THE SONG'S CALLED STOWAWAY BUT IT'S WRITTEN FROM THE CAPTAIN'S POINT OF VIEW 
COULD YOU PLAY ONE WE'VE GOT A KIND OF CELTIC SOUND AND IT'S A VERY LIVELY SONG 
BUT WITH QUITE A SAD THEME TO IT ABOUT MISSING OUT ON LOVE 
WE'VE GOT YAMIT MAMO SINGING WHO SOME FRIENDS OF MINE DISCOVERED SINGING ON STAGE IN LONDON 
ONCE I FOUND A STOWAWAY 
UPON MY SHIP ON CHRISTMAS DAY 
I WAS FAIR SO I GAVE HIM A CHANCE 
SHE'S REALLY GOOD YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE WHAT'S YOUR TALE 
I OUGHT TO THROW YOU TO THE WHALE 
HE JUST SMILED AND SAID COME HERE LET'S DANCE 
HE SAID BORROW OR STEAL I'LL FIND A WAY TO BE WITH MY LOVER 
UPON CHRISTMAS DAY I'LL RUN AND I'LL ROAM 
I'LL COVER THE GROUND 
THIS CHRISTMAS I'LL SEE YOU I'LL BE AROUND 
PROBABLY COULD DO WITH A BIT MORE OF ME IN THERE ACTUALLY 
WE'LL DO ONE MORE TAKE WITH THE STRINGS AND GIVE IT A BIT MORE THUMP 
I'M A SOUL SINGER GENERALLY BUT I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR MURRAY GOLD 
AND HE'S ASKED ME TO DO THIS SO YEAH IT'S BEEN GREAT 
TO BE WITH MY LOVER TO BE WITH MY LOVER 
UPON CHRISTMAS DAY UPON CHRISTMAS DAY 
TO BE WITH MY LOVER UPON CHRISTMAS DAY EXACTLY 
I THINK HE DANCED WITH HER NOT ME 
I'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR 
HE SAID BORROW OR STEAL I'LL FIND A WAY 
AND I RUN AND I'LL ROAM AND COVER THE GROUND 
THIS CHRISTMAS I'LL SEE YOU I'LL BE AROUND 
IT'S GOT ITS ROOTS IN AN IRISH FOLK TRADITION IT'S GREAT FUN 
IT'S EVERYBODY TOGETHER AT CHRISTMAS HAVING A GOOD TIME 
IT'S PERFECT FOR THE SETTING IN THE TITANIC IT'S THE KIND OF SONG THAT MAYBE WAS PLAYED ON DECK 
IT'S A KIND OF REALLY GOOD FUN SONG 
I'LL JUST SING IT TO YOU ONCE DUR DUR DUM DUM DUR DUR DUM DUM DUM DUM 
DUR DUM DUR DUR DUM DUM DUM 
WE NEED A CROWD OF PEOPLE TO SING AS WELL SO GET EVERYONE IN THE BUILDING TO COME SING AS WELL 
WE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES PROBABLY BE OFF KEY 
HE SAID BORROW OR STEAL I'LL FIND A WAY 
TO BE WITH MY LOVER UPON CHRISTMAS DAY 
THESE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN OFTEN IT'S A ONE OFF EVERYONE TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
IT'S CHRISTMAS SUDDENLY BUT IT'S SEPTEMBER 
IT'S VERY SURREAL BUT A BRILLIANT EXPERIENCE IT'S GOOD FUN 
AAH AAH AAH 
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE WHAT'S YOUR TALE 
I OUGHT TO THROW YOU TO THE WHALE 
MICHAEL AND BEN FORSTER WHO HAVE BEEN SUPPLYING OUR MUSIC SINCE DOCTOR WHO CAME BACK 
WERE ON SET AND NOBODY TOLD ME 
IT WAS FIVE O'CLOCK ON THEIR FIRST DAY BEFORE I LOOKED ROUND AND WENT 
THAT BLOKE WITH A DODGY MOUSTACHE IN THE BAND LOOKS FAMILIAR 
THEN I REALISED IT WAS MURRAY GOLD IN SOME FORM OF DISGUISE 
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT I AM IN IT BUT I WISH THE ONE OPPORTUNITY I HAD 
I DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR THIS TACHE AND I'VE GOT THIS ARMOURED PLATED SHIRT LIKE MADE OF CARDBOARD 
THE REAL SCARY SECRET OF IT IS I'M NOT MATURE ENOUGH TO GROW A TACHE THIS THICK 
SO THIS IS MY ONE CHANCE TO LOOK LIKE A RUSSIAN COUNT 
HE HADN'T COME UP AND SAID HELLO HE'S JUST BEEN THERE 
PLONKING AWAY ON HIS GUITAR ALL DAY SO IT WAS VERY NICE TO SEE HIM 
I'VE GOT A LOT OF RESPECT FOR EVERYONE WHO DOES THIS SUPPORTING ACTOR WORK BECAUSE IT'S SO BORING 
YOU KNOW YOU JUST SIT THERE IN YOUR TACHE AND YOUR FAKE STUFF 
JUST SORT OF MOULDING IN THE SUNSHINE AND YOU GET CALLED IN EVERY NOW AND AGAIN AND PRANCE ABOUT FOR A BIT 
BUT THAT'S THE ACTOR'S LIFE 
IT WAS JUST PART OF THE DEAL THAT MURRAY AND BEN WOULD BE THERE 
I'M SURE THEY GOT BORED TO TEARS FILMING 
IT'S ACTUALLY BRILLIANT TO SEE THEM THERE JOINING IN 
HE SAID BORROW OR STEAL I'LL FIND A WAY 
TO BE WITH MY LOVER UPON CHRISTMAS DAY 
AND I'LL RUN AND I'LL ROAM I'LL COVER THE GROUND 
THIS CHRISTMAS I'LL SEE YOU I'LL BE AROUND 
THIS IS A BIG PARTY ON THE TITANIC 
SO YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE PHYSICALLY IN THE ROOM 
WE HAD FIFTY PEOPLE IN THERE THEN YOU'VE GOT OUR PRINCIPALS 
THEN A BAND ON STAGE THEN ALL OF US LOT TO SHOOT IT 
THEY WERE BIG DAYS IN THE LOUNGE IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SET 
A BECAUSE THE LOCATION WAS PERFECT IN TERMS OF ALL THE WOOD PANELLING IT'S MADE OF 
IT'S AN AMAZING PLACE BUT THEN THE ART DEPARTMENT DRESSED THE SETS 
ED THOMAS AND OUR DESIGN TEAM DID US PROUD IT WAS TRICKY COS IN DECIDING TO DO A TITANIC 
I KNEW FROM THE START WE'VE GOT TO HAVE BALLROOMS UPSTAIRS CORRIDORS 
IT'S GOT TO LOOK A BIT NINETEEN TWELVE 
I WORRIED ABOUT THAT I SAID I'M NOT SURE WHAT BUILDINGS WE'VE GOT HERE THAT COULD RECREATE THAT 
I WAS AN IDIOT TO WORRY COS OUT WENT OUR LOCATION MANAGERS ED AND HIS DESIGN TEAM 
AND THEY CAME BACK WITH THESE PLACES THAT MADE YOU THINK WE COULD HAVE DONE THE REAL TITANIC 
YOU GET THE NOTES FROM RUSSELL 
WE'RE DOING THE TITANIC YOU THINK OH GOD 
I WAS VERY KEEN THAT WHEN YOU WATCH IT YOU REALLY FEEL AS IF YOU ARE ON BOARD THIS SHIP 
THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS OF ACHIEVING THAT 
LITTLE TOUCHES LIKE A ROULETTE TABLE LOTS OF PERIOD DETAILS 
LAMPS TABLE DECORATIONS CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS BUT ALSO WITH A SLIGHTLY MODERN TWIST HERE AND THERE 
THE ODD COMPUTER SCREEN THE ODD THING THAT JUST GAVE YOU A HINT THIS WASN'T NINETEEN TWELVE 
WE HAD A CHRISTMAS TREE IT'S ABOUT SELLING A CHRISTMAS ATMOSPHERE 
SET DRESSING IS HUGELY IMPORTANT A LOT OF WHAT WE DO HERE IS PROVIDING THE WALLPAPER FOR A SCENE 
THOSE PERIOD DETAILS REALLY HAVE TO BE RIGHT 
ON THE NAPKINS WE HAD THE MAX CAPRICORN LOGO EMBROIDERED ON 
AS THEY WOULD HAVE ON THE TITANIC 
ALL THE PLATES AND CUTLERY HAD THE LOGOS IT'S WHAT HELPS SELL IT 
YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE IT STRAIGHTAWAY BUT IT REALLY ALL ADDS TO THE FLAVOUR 
WE FOUND SOME FANTASTIC LOCATIONS 
BY THE TIME YOU'VE FILLED IT WITH FIFTY EXTRAS IN NINETEEN TWELVE GEAR 
IT ALL BECOMES RATHER MAGICAL 
IT'S THE THIRTY FIRST JULY AND WE'RE ABOUT TO GO 
FROM THIS STUDIO NOW OUT ONTO THE STREETS OF CARDIFF 
WE DID THIS BIG SET PIECE IN ONE OF CARDIFF'S MAIN STREETS 
AND EVERYBODY WAS REALLY WORRIED THERE'D BE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE 
THERE WASN'T ANY FUSS AT ALL IT WAS A TESTAMENT 
TO THE PRODUCTION TEAM AND GARETH SKELDING WHO LOOKED AFTER LOCATIONS THEY WERE BRILLIANTLY MANAGED 
WE NEEDED A STREET IN CARDIFF THAT GAVE US A SCALE 
WHERE WE COULD DO THE CHRISTMAS ASPECT OF IT 
BUT TRY AND KEEP EVERYTHING QUIET 
WHICH I THINK WE'VE ACHIEVED FINGERS CROSSED WE'RE HALFWAY THERE 
EVENING 
ALTHOUGH WE'VE HAD A FEW CROWDS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS AND SO ON 
WHEN WE'VE BEEN GOING IN AND OUT OF LOCATIONS WE'VE BEEN MOSTLY LEFT FAIRLY UNTROUBLED 
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL GET AWAY WITH TONIGHT DOCTOR WHO TENDS TO GET ATTENTION 
IF YOU ADD TO THAT KYLIE MINOGUE IT MIGHT BE A BIT TRICKY TONIGHT 
THE SECURITY GUARDS ARE DESPERATE FOR A FIGHT SO IT'LL BE FINE 
WE'RE FILMING THIS MOMENT WHEN THEY ALL COME TO EARTH 
IT'S QUITE SURREAL BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF CARDIFF WHEN THERE'S NO ONE HERE IT'S GREAT 
THEY ACTUALLY SEALED OFF A STREET WHICH WE'VE NEVER QUITE DONE BEFORE 
WE'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO SNEAK IT IN BEFORE THE SET GETS INVADED BY THE PUBLIC 
AND TURN OVER 
OH NOW AS SPENDING MONEY I HAVE A CREDIT CARD IN EARTH CURRENCY 
SO IF YOU WANT TO BUY TRINKETS OR STOCKINGS OR THE LOCAL DELICACY 
ANY DAY NOW THEY START BOXING 
SHOULD BE FULL SHOULD BE BUSY SOMETHING'S WRONG IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
REALLY DO YOU THINK SO IT'S JUST A STREET I MEAN 
THE PYRAMIDS ARE BEAUTIFUL 
AND NEW ZEALAND 
IT'S A DIFFERENT PLANET 
I'M STANDING ON A DIFFERENT PLANET 
THERE'S CONCRETE AND SHOPS ALIEN SHOPS REAL ALIEN SHOPS 
THIS IS AMAZING THANK YOU 
AND CUT THERE O. K. GUYS JUST CLEAR FOR ME PLEASE 
SORRY UM OBVIOUS QUESTION BUT WHERE'S EVERYBODY GONE 
WO OH SCARED RIGHT YES 
LONDON AT CHRISTMAS IT'S NOT SAFE IS IT 
WHY WELL IT'S THEM UP ABOVE 
THE CHRISTMAS BEFORE LAST WE HAD THAT BIG BLOODY SPACESHIP EVERYONE STANDING ON THE ROOF 
AND THEN LAST YEAR WE HAD THE CHRISTMAS STAR ELECTROCUTING ALL OVER THE PLACE DRAINING THE THAMES 
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING 
THIS YEAR GAWD KNOWS WHAT SO EVERYBODY'S SCARPERED GONE TO THE COUNTRY AND CUT THERE 
WE ARE INTRODUCING THE TRADITION NOW THAT LONDON IS A DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE AT CHRISTMAS 
I LIKE DEATH AND DISASTER TO RAIN DOWN ON THE CAPITAL ON CHRISTMAS DAY 
IT'S BECOMING A BIT OF AN IN JOKE ACTUALLY 
HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN HAS CONFIRMED THAT SHE'LL BE STAYING IN BUCKINGHAM PALACE THROUGHOUT THE FESTIVE SEASON 
TO SHOW THE PEOPLE OF LONDON AND THE WORLD THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR 
I THINK I'M QUITE ENJOYING BUILDING UP THIS PRESENT DAY EARTH 
WHERE PEOPLE ARE BECOMING VERY AWARE OF IT AND STILL GO TO WORK 
MY FIRST EPISODE WAS THE FIRST CHRISTMAS SPECIAL 
WHICH WAS A BIT DAUNTING AT THE TIME TO BE LAUNCHED TO THE NATION 
ON THE MOST IMPORTANT T. V. DAY OF THE YEAR AND ALL THAT 
ACTION 
BOTH WORKING 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BOTH THEY'VE GOT TWO HEARTS OH DON'T BE STUPID 
WELL HE HAS ANYTHING ELSE HE'S GOT TWO OF LEAVE HIM ALONE 
BREATHE 
A VERY NICE MEMORY TO HAVE 
I SAT WITH THE FAMILY AND WE ALL WATCHED IT TOGETHER ON CHRISTMAS DAY LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO 
SO I SUPPOSE I DO FEEL PARTICULARLY ATTACHED TO THE IDEA OF A DOCTOR WHO CHRISTMAS EPISODE YEAH 
I GUESS THE FIRST TIME WITH THE CHRISTMAS INVASION THERE WERE NO PRECEDENTS 
YEAH WE HAD A KILLER CHRISTMAS TREE 
WHY WOULDN'T YOU IT'S DOCTOR WHO AND THE SANTAS WHO THEN CAME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR YEAH 
AND YOU'RE ALL AIMING FOR THIS SIDE OF THE CAMERA 
TONIGHT IS THE SECOND OF TWO NIGHTS 
THAT WE'VE BEEN FILMING A SEQUENCE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE SET 
IN LONDON FOR THE CHRISTMAS SPECIAL 
IT'S NICKY AND ROSE'S FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE SINISTER SANTAS 
WHO ARE KIND OF SENTINELS 
FROM THE ALIENS WHO ARE POISED TO INVADE THE EARTH ON CHRISTMAS DAY ACTION 
START TO LOWER YOUR INSTRUMENTS NOW 
WEAPONS COMING DOWN WAIT FOR THE CUE FOR WEAPONS TO COME DOWN 
AND THEN I'LL SHOUT FLAME 
FIRE 
STAND BACK 
I GUESS IT'S JUST THE SCALE OF SOMETHING ON CHRISTMAS DAY WHEN THE BLOCKBUSTER MOVIES ARE PREMIERING 
AND ACTION 
AND YOU HAVE TO KIND OF BE IN AMONGST THAT MAKING A SPLASH 
AND IT'S CHRISTMAS DAY 
YOU'VE GOT TO CELEBRATE THINGS YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE BUNTING OUT 
SO WE TRY AND GO THAT EXTRA MILE 
I THINK IT'S THRILLING TO BE MAKING A CHRISTMAS SPECIAL 
WE'VE ALSO BEEN COMMISSIONED TO MAKE A CHRISTMAS SPECIAL FOR NEXT YEAR FOR TWO THOUSAND SIX AS WELL 
I WOULD HOPE THIS IS GOING TO BECOME THE NORM FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS ANYWAY 
IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE LAST YEAR WHEN THE RUNAWAY BRIDE WAS GOING OUT AND YOU OPENED UP THE PAPERS 
AND LISTINGS MAGAZINES AND YOU'D FIND IT BEING SPOKEN ABOUT AS THIS TRADITION 
THIS CHRISTMAS TRADITION AND YOU THINK IT'S ONLY THE SECOND ONE 
IT WAS BIZARRE 
TURN THIS CAB AROUND RIGHT NOW 
O. I. ARE YOU DEATH OR WHAT 
DONNA 
WA A A AH 
WE ARE FILMING ON TOP OF A BUILDING JUST OFF FLEET STREET IN LONDON 
THE SECURITY IS REALLY TIGHT BECAUSE IT'S CATHERINE TATE'S FIRST DAY 
THE NATION DON'T KNOW SHE'S GONNA BE PLAYING DONNA 
WHO IS COMPANION TO THE DOCTOR FOR THE CHRISTMAS SPECIAL 
ACTION 
MAYBE I SHOULD COME OUT BLASTING AS WELL AS IF IT'S QUITE OUT OF CONTROL YEAH FIRE FIGHTER E. Y. 
TAMING THE BEAST 
UGH 
FUNNY THING IS FOR A SPACESHIP SHE DOESN'T DO THAT MUCH FLYING 
WE'D BETTER GIVE HER A COUPLE OF HOURS ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
IT DOESN'T MATTER 
I THINK THE JOKE IS ABOUT LIKE HOW WE'RE LIKE A MARRIED COUPLE 
YOU'VE HAD THE LONG SCENE IN THE TARDIS WHERE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN YOUR FAULT YEAH 
SORRY 
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT OH 
THAT'S A CHANGE 
I KIND OF LEAP DOWN IN A SLIGHTLY SPRIGHTLY MANNER AND BOTH TIMES I'VE KIND OF GONE WHEH HEY 
LOOKING OUT OVER LONDON 
GOD YOU'RE SKINNY THIS WOULDN'T FIT A RAT COME ON THEN ROBOT SANTAS WHAT ARE THEY 
OH IT'S YOUR BASIC ROBOT SCAVENGER 
THE FATHER CHRISTMAS STUFF IS JUST A DISGUISE 
O. I. SANTA 
YOU'D BETTER NOT CRY I'M TELLING YOU WHY 
SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN 
CONTINUING THE TREND OF DOCTOR WHO CHRISTMAS SPECIALS 
THIS YEAR'S SEASONAL SHOW HAS BEEN TAKEN TO THE BRIDGE 
I LOVE THE BRIDGE SET OF THE TITANIC AND THE SET HAD TO BE REALLY QUITE SPECIFIC 
IT HAD TO FEEL LIKE THE REST OF THE SHIP BECAUSE WE MADE THE REST 
OF THE TITANIC FEEL LIKE A REAL HOMAGE TO THE ORIGINAL SHIP 
THESE ALIENS HAD COPIED PLANS I IMAGINE OF THE TITANIC 
QUIET PLEASE FORTY THREE TAKE ONE 
AND ACTION 
ORBIT NICE AND STEADY 
GOOD WORK 
AND MAINTAIN POSITION 
NOW THEN GENTLEMEN ACCORDING TO THE TRADITIONS OF THE PLANET BELOW CHRISTMAS IS A TIME OF CELEBRATION 
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE ENTITLED TO A TOT OF RUM JUST THE ONE 
CUT THERE 
THE SET WAS QUITE SMALL AND IT NEEDED TO BE SHOT REALLY QUITE SPECIFICALLY 
THOSE WINDOWS ENABLE YOU TO GET OUTSIDE AND ACROSS THE FRONT 
OF THE ACTION AND SEE THE CHARACTERS LOOKING OUT 
I THINK IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL SET AND ONE OF THE BEST ONES WE'VE MADE ACTUALLY 
IS THAT BETTER FOR THE STACKING 
GEOFFREY JUST HOLD THE LINE HERE 
BE ON THE LINE BUT NOT 
TOO FAR O. K. 
GREAT THANK YOU

FIRST TRIP OUT THEN YOU CAN STAND DOWN MIDSHIPMAN 
MY CHARACTER IS MIDSHIPMAN FRAME 
AND HE'S ON HIS FIRST JOB OUT HE'S JUST QUALIFIED 
FROM NAVAL ACADEMY AND HE STAYS ON THE CAPTAIN'S DECK WITH THE CAPTAIN 
REGULATIONS SAY THE BRIDGE HAS TO BE STAFFED BY TWO CREW MEMBERS AT ANY ONE TIME SIR 
WELL SAID VERY GOOD 
HE'S KIND OF LIKE A BIT OF A JOBSWORTH A BIT EXCITED 
ACTION

WE'VE GOT A METEOROID STORM HEADING IN WEST ZERO BY NORTH TWO WHO IS THIS 
NEVER MIND THAT YOUR SHIELDS ARE DOWN CHECK YOUR SCANNERS CAPTAIN 
YOU'VE GOT METEOROIDS COMING IN AND NO SHIELDING

WHEN YOU POINT UP TO HIM THEN BRING IT DOWN WITH A POSITIVE ACTION 
AND THEN A POSITIVE SQUEEZE OF THE TRIGGER O. K. 
IS THERE NOTHING MUCH COMES OUT OF THE OTHER END 
NO IT'S JUST A BIT OF HOT AIR BASICALLY 
THEY'RE SAFER THAN THEY USED TO BE I REMEMBER BEING HIT BY SOMEONE WHO FIRED A GUN AT ME IN A TELEVISION 
AT GRANADA YEARS AGO AND I WAS SORT OF PEPPERED WITH BITS OF CARDBOARD 
THAT SEEMED TO HIT ME QUITE HARD 
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN ANY MORE GUNFIRE 
SHOOT THERE YEAH WHERE MY HAND IS NOW O. K. 
READY I'M READY 
O. K. THANK YOU WE GO AGAIN

I'M SORRY SIR ON THE CREW 
SEA DOGS MEN WHO'D HAD THEIR TIME 
NOT BOYS 
HE'S A GOOD MAN A VERY GOOD MAN 
NICE MAN LOVES HIS CREW LOVES HIS JOB ALL THAT 
AND I THINK HAS BEEN TOTALLY BLACKMAILED BY THE EVIL MONSTER 
AND HE'S KIND OF GIVEN NO CHOICE REALLY 
HE'S GOT TO DO THIS JOB OTHERWISE HIS FAMILY ARE TAKEN OUT OR SOMETHING NASTY WILL HAPPEN TO THEM 
SO HE REALLY HAS NO OPTION BUT TO CRASH THE TITANIC I'M SORRY SIR 
IT'S MY DUTY 
WITH ASTRID YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO IS A COMPANION IN MY MIND I ABSOLUTELY 
CONSIDER HER TO BE A COMPANION WHO TAKES THE ULTIMATE STEP 
OUT OF THOSE WOMEN AND MEN WHO WOULD GIVE THEIR LIVES TO THE DOCTOR SHE LITERALLY DOES AND ACTION 
MR. CAPRICORN 
I RESIGN 
IT'S A MOMENT WHERE THERE'S SIMPLY NO ESCAPE 
ASTRID DON'T MAX HAS TO BE STOPPED 
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO DRIVE THAT FORKLIFT TRUCK 
AND SHE'S DRIVING AT THE MAX BOX AND IS EDGING FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS AND IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE 
AND SHE LOOKS ACROSS AT THE DOCTOR 
IT MAY BE THE FIRST TIME THAT THE EARTH HAS BEEN SAVED BY A FORKLIFT TRUCK I'M NOT SURE 
IT KIND OF SUITED KYLIE SITTING IN THAT FORK LIFT TRUCK 
I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT SHE SEEMED AT HOME THERE SHE WASN'T ACTUALLY ALLOWED TO DRIVE IT 
DO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TAKE A CERTIFICATE TO DRIVE A FORKLIFT TRUCK 
HE'S GONE MAD 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN GONE 
WE HAD A STUNT LADY IN A WIG FOR THAT BIT BUT IT'S VERY CLEVERLY CUT TOGETHER OBVIOUSLY 
AND WE HAD GEORGE IN HIS MAX BOX AND THE TWO MEETING AND WHEELS SPINNING 
IT'S A FAIRLY SURREAL IMAGE REALLY 
ACTION 
MR. CAPRICORN 
O. K. CUT THERE THIRD POSITION 
THE END SEQUENCE WHEN SHE BASICALLY CONFRONTS MAX AND DRIVES HIM OFF THE EDGE OF THIS CLIFF 
WAS QUITE COMPLICATED DUE TO ALL OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS 
WE HAD A STUNT PERFORMER 
DRIVING THE FORKLIFT TRUCK 
AND ACTION SO KYLIE'S DRIVING ACROSS THE FLOOR TOWARDS THE BOX AND SHE HITS THE BOX 
IT'S HAPPENING IT'S HAPPENING 
AND HE STEPS IN TO THROW AND HE'S GOING TO THROW THE HALO 
HE'S CUT THE BRAKE LINE HE'S TRYING TO DRIVE FORWARD NO NO 
SHE LOOKS AT YOU AND START THROWING THE DEBRIS AND ACTION 
SHE LOOKS BACK AND SHE'S GOING TO LURCH FORWARD AND SHE GOES 
DAVID SAYS NO 
BUT SHE'S GOING TO GO FOR IT AND SHE PUTS HER FOOT DOWN AND SHE GOES 
BUT THE BRAKES HAVE BEEN CUT SHE GOES ALL THE WAY 
NOT JUST TO SAVE THE DOCTOR BUT TO SAVE THE EARTH 
AND TO SAVE EVERYONE STILL ON THAT SHIP IT'S THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE 
THAT'S WHY IT HAD TO BE FALLING REALLY BECAUSE 
WITHOUT ROMANTICISING SOMETHING TERRIBLE 
BUT IN A DISASTER MOVIE A FALL LIKE THAT 
IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL IMAGE AND SUCH A SAD IMAGE 
YOU COULDN'T GET SOMEONE HIT BY A LASER AND FELLED IT JUST WOULDN'T BE BIG ENOUGH 
IT HAD TO BE A BIG STUNT A BIG VISUAL A LOT OF C. G. I. GOING INTO IT TO MARK THE MOMENT 
YEAH I DID SOME WIRE WORK WHICH WASN'T FOR TOO LONG 
IT WAS FUNNY HOW THE 
PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR KIND OF MENTIONED WIRES KIND OF 
BUT DIDN'T SAY THE WORD WIRE 
WELL YOU WILL BE FLYING. 
I'M SURE EVERY SEASON THEY'RE GONNA HAVE PEOPLE FLYING THROUGH 
BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY NEVER SURE HOW COMFORTABLE YOU ARE WITH THAT 
STICK THE GREEN BACK WHERE IT SHOULD BE 
FOR KYLIE HER DEATH IF YOU LIKE 
WHEN SHE FALLS AND SHE SACRIFICES HERSELF TO SAVE THE TITANIC AND EVERYBODY 
SHE BASICALLY HAS TO FALL OFF THIS INCREDIBLY HIGH LEDGE DOWN INTO THE CORE OF THE ENGINE 
COMING UP STEVE 
THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT REALLY WAS TO SUSPEND HER ON WIRES AGAINST A GREEN SCREEN BACKGROUND 
HIYA 
JUST LEAN BACK AS FAR AS YOU CAN YOU CAN'T GO OVER YOU'RE ALL RIGHT 
GO ON 
AND THEN WE DROP HER ON WIRES AND THEN IN POST PRODUCTION 
THE C. G. I. TEAM REMOVE THE WIRES AND ADD IN THE BACKGROUND 
SO THAT INVOLVED US BASICALLY PUTTING KYLIE ON A WIRE AND HANGING HER FIFTY F. T. IN THE AIR 
O. K. JUST LET KYLIE SETTLE A SECOND ARE YOU HAPPY OTHERWISE GUYS 
THANK YOU HERE WE GO THEN 
AND TURN OVER 
AND ACTION KYLIE THREE TWO ONE ACTION 
KYLIE'S CLIMACTIC FINALE HAS SENT CAST AND CREW TO SWANSEA 
AND ON SET THE DOCTOR WHO PRODUCTION TEAM ARE PREPARING 
FOR THE MOMENT MISS MINOGUE TURNS FROM SUPERSTAR TO SUPER STARDUST 
WE'VE SEEN ASTRID FALL AND WE THINK THAT'S THE END OF HER 
AND THEN THERE'S THIS HOPE THIS BRIEF SCENE 
WHICH WE MANAGE TO KIND OF GET HER BACK 
AND ACTION 
MR. COPPER THE TELEPORTS HAVE THEY GOT AN EMERGENCY SETTING 
I DON'T KNOW THEY SHOULD HAVE 
MR. COPPER SHE FELL WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY CODE 
LET ME SEE WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING WE CAN BRING HER BACK 
IF A PASSENGER HAS AN ACCIDENT AND THEY'RE WEARING THEIR TELEPORT 
THE MOLECULES ARE AUTOMATICALLY SUSPENDED AND HELD IN STASIS 
IF WE CAN JUST CHECK ON THE SHIFT 
I'M FALLING SHE'S ONLY HALFWAY THERE COME ON 
I KEEP FALLING 
ONLY HALFWAY THERE COME ON 
FEEDBACK THE MOLECULE BOOSTER WITH 
NO NO 
WE NEED MORE PHASE CONTAINMENT 
IT'S LIKE A DOCTOR MOMENT THAT BECAUSE HE CAN'T BRING THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE 
I CAN DO ANYTHING 
STOP ME FALLING 
WHEN HE KICKS THE PODIUM DAVID'S SO BRILLIANT HE SAYS I CAN DO ANYTHING BUT HE CAN'T 
HE HAS SUCH MASTERY OVER EVERY SITUATION 
THAT YOU REALLY NEED THOSE MOMENTS SAYING THAT'S TOO FAR 
YOU CAN'T BRING HER BACK 
IN SOME WAYS HE HAS THESE GREAT POWERS ABILITIES 
AND HE CAN SAVE ALL MANNER OF SOLAR SYSTEMS BUT HE CAN'T SEEM TO SAVE THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO HIM 
THE TRUTH IS THAT WITHOUT ASTRID SACRIFICING HERSELF 
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THE EARTH WOULDN'T HAVE GOT FRIED 
SHE'S STARDUST 
AND YET THE DOCTOR'S DEVASTATED BY THE FACT THAT SHE DOES 
HE WOULD'VE LOVED TO FLY OFF INTO THE SUNSET WITH HER 
LET HER GO 
SHE DIES SHE'S GONE AND THE DOCTOR AS EVER MOVES ON 
IN A WAY ALMOST TOO FAST AND TOO QUICK IT NEEDS THAT FINAL CODA AT THE END 
AND I LIKE THAT CODA AT THE END IT LOOKS VERY SENTIMENTAL 
JUST ATOMS DOCTOR 
AN ECHO A GHOST OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
IT WAS ACTUALLY QUITE A LOGISTICS EXERCISE BECAUSE SHE'S MEANT TO BE TRANSPARENT 
SO WHAT THAT MEANT WAS WE HAD TO BASICALLY SHOOT THE SCENE TWICE 
OBVIOUSLY ONCE WITH HER THERE AND THEN LITERALLY DAVID HAS TO ACT TO NOTHING 
TAKE ONE ACTION 
ASTRID PETH CITIZEN OF STO 
THE WOMAN WHO LOOKED UP AT THE STARS AND DREAMT OF TRAVELLING 
IT WAS VERY HARD FOR DAVID COS HE HAD TO KISS NOTHING IN THE END 
SO HE'S DOING THIS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND TOUCHING MOMENT DOING IT TO NOBODY WHICH IS REALLY HARD 
BUT DAVID OBVIOUSLY DID IT AMAZINGLY AND THE END RESULT IS STUNNING 
ASTRID PETH 
CITIZEN OF STO 
THE WOMAN WHO LOOKED UP AT THE STARS AND DREAMT OF TRAVELLING 
SHE DOES GET TO KISS HIM SO PROBABLY A GREAT NUMBER 
OF THE AUDIENCE WOULD LIKE TO BE IN MY POSITION 
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING 
THAT MAKES THIS EPISODE AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP SO BITTERSWEET 
YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S POTENTIAL AND THERE'S CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THEM 
AND THAT'S HER DREAM THAT'S ALL SHE WOULD HAVE EVER WISHED FOR 
AND THE FACT THAT AT THE BEGINNING SHE'S DREAMING SHE DOES LOOK OUT AT THE STARS 
AND THEN SHE BECOMES ONE OF THEM 
OR MILLIONS OF THEM AS STARDUST 
I THINK IT'S REALLY POETIC 
HE'S LOST SOMEONE WHO COULD HAVE MADE HIS LIFE THAT LITTLE BIT LESS LONELY 
AT THE END HE'S LEFT ALONE AGAIN THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITE IMAGES THE LONELY DOCTOR 
IT'S DOCTOR WHO HE'S GOT TO BE THE LONELY TRAVELLER 
HE'S GOT TO BE CRUELLY ROBBED OF A BIT OF HAPPINESS HASN'T HE 
DAMN
