RAPIDLY MOVING SITUATION ALSO 
MIGRANT WORKERS HAVE BROUGHT LITTLE 
OR NO ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO BRITAIN 
ACCORDING TO A PARLIAMENTARY REPORT 
THE FIRST ANIMAL HUMAN EMBRYO IS 
DEVELOPED BY BRITISH SCIENTISTS WE 
HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE REPORT 
PAUL BURRELL BEHAVED SHABILY AND 
DIDN'T TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH AT THE 
INQUEST INTO DIANA'S DEATH

WHAT DOES THIS IMAGE STAY ABOUT 
PECKHAM HARRIET HARMAN COMES UNDER 
FIRE FOR A ROUTINE WALKABOUT 
GOOD EVENING THERE ARE SIGNS OF 
DRAMATIC CHANGE IN ZIMBABWE AMID 
CLAIMS THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE IS 
ABOUT TO STEP ASIDE THREE DAYS 
AFTER THE ELECTIONING TOOK PLACE 
OPPOSITION SOURCES HAVE TOLD THE 
B. B. C. THAT A POSSIBLE DEAL TO 
TRANSFER POWER FROM MR. MUGABE TO 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS BEING PUT IN 
PLACE THIS EVENING THE OPPOSITION 
PARTY THE M. D. C. SAY THAT 
NEGOTIATIONS ARE STILL TAKING PLACE 
BUT THAT NO FORMAL DEAL HAS YET 
BEEN SIGNED LET'S JOIN THE B. B. C.'S 
GEORGE ALAGIAH WHO IS ON THE 
ZIMBABWEN BORDER 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED I AM AT 
THAT BORDER BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA 
AND ZIMBABWE IT'S ALSO THE PLACE 
WHERE MANY THOUSANDS OF ZIMBABWENS 
HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE FROM WHAT'S 
GOING ON IN THEIR COUNTRY FOR 
THOSE PEOPLE HERE AND IN THERE THIS 
IS PRECISELY THE KIND OF NEWS THEY 
WERE HOPING FOR BUT I CAN TELL YOU 
TALKING TO SOME PEOPLE HERE MANAGED TO 
GET INSIDE AND TALK TO HIM AND 
LISTEN TO HIM ABOUT A MOVE THAT 
COULD MARK THE BIGGEST CHANGE IN 
THE COUNTRY FOR SOME THIRTY YEARS 
SOURCES WITHIN THE OPPOSITION 
MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN 
ZIMBABWE SAY THEY'VE ALMOST REACHED 
A DEAL FOR PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE 
TO STAND DOWN I UNDERSTAND THAT 
TALKS BROKERED BY SOUTH AFRICAN 
NEGOTIATORS INVOLVING PRESIDENT 
THABO MBEKI HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE 
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS IN THE 
CAPITAL HARARE REPRESENTATIVES OF 
THE MILITARY AND POLICE HAVE BEEN 
INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSIONS 
TALKS HAVE ALSO TAKING PLACE 
BETWEEN THE RULING 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PRESIDENT 
AND THE OPPOSITION LEADER MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI TSVANGIRAI THE DEAL WOULD INVOLVE ROBERT 
MUGABE MAKING THE PUBLIC 
ANNOUNCEMENT ON STATE TELEVISION 
THAT HE IS STANDING TO ONE SIDE 
ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHEN 
THIS WOULD TAKE PLACE MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI WOULD THEN BE DECLAREDED 
WINNING CANDIDATE IN THE 
PRESIDENTIAL RACE 
HOWEVER THE SOURCES ARE URGING 
CAUTION SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT 
AND HIS PARTY COULD CHANGE THEIR 
MIND AND THE DEAL IS STILL NOT CAST 
IRON UNTIL AN ANNOUNCEMENT IS MADE 
THE SOURCES ARE NOT INDEPENDENTLY 
VERIFIED VERIFIED THE MOMENTUM HAS BEEN GENERATED 
WELL THE B. B. C.'S WORLD AFFAIRS EDITOR 
JOHN SIMPSON IS ALSO INSIDE 
ZIMBABWE WE CAN TALK TO HIM NOW 
JOHN WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE 
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS 
WELL THE M. D. C. 
THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE 
HAS BEEN THREATENING YOU COULD SAY 
TO HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE ALL DAY 
IN HARARE HERE AT NINE HUNDRED EVERYBODY 
TROOPED IN TO SEE WHAT THEY HAD TO 
SAY AND IT WAS PUT OFF UNTIL ONE THOUSAND 
AT ONE THOUSAND IT WAS PUT OFF UNTIL THE 
AFTERNOON AND NOW WE HEAR IT COULD 
BE TAKING PLACE IN TWO HOURS' TIME 
ALWAYS BEHIND THAT THERE WAS A 
SENSE THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME KIND 
OF BREAKTHROUGH BEHIND IT ALL THE 
DETAILS HAVE NOT EMERGED HERE AND 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
POSSIBILITIES ARE FRANKLY IT HAS 
TO BE SAID THAT ON THE ONE HAND 
THAT ROBERT MUGABE IS A VERY 
SKILLED NEGOTIATOR AND IS PRETTY 
UNLIKELY I THINK JUST SIMPLY TO SAY 
O. K. I HAVE BEEN BEATEN I AM STEPPING 
ASIDE NOW AND WAVE A CHEERFUL 
GOODBYE I THINK THAT'S PRETTY 
UNLIKELY AND I THINK WE WILL HAVE 
TO LOOK VERY MUCH AT THE FINE 
DETAILS OF ANY KIND OF AGREEMENT 
WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE 
GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE DETAIL 
JUDGING BY WHAT YOU HAVE SAID IN 
THE PAST ZIMBABWENENS ARE 
PRESUMABLY GOING TO WAIT UNTIL THE 
LAST MINUTE BEFORE THEY BELIEVE 
THIS 
YES THE MOOD'S CHANGED HERE THIS ACTUALLY GEORGE DURING THE DAY 
IT'S BEEN INTERESTING OVER THE 
LAST THREE DAYS PEOPLE HAVE STAYED 
AWAY FROM WORK STAYED AWAY FROM 
THE SHOPS THE STREETS HAVE BEEN 
EMPTY OF CARS BUT TODAY THE CENTRE 
OF HARARE WAS ABSOLUTELY BUSTLING 
ONCE AGAIN THE SHOPS WERE FULL OF 
PEOPLE THERE WERE LONG QUEUES THAT 
EVERYBODY'S SO USED TO HERE WITH 
INFLATION RISING IT'S GONE UP 
EIGHT TIMES IN THREE MONTHS AND 
THERE IS A GENERAL SENSE I THINK IN 
THERE IS A GENERAL SENSE I THINK IN WHICH EVERYBODY IS ABSOLUTELY 
DESPERATE FOR SOME WAY OUT OF THIS 
AND IF IT CAN BE DONE PEACEFULLY 
AND QUIETLY EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE 
REJOICING HERE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AS JOHN WAS SAYING THESE ARE 
MOMENTOUS TIMES FOR THE PEOPLE IN 
ZIMBABWE WE WILL KNOW PERHAPS IN 
THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS BUT 
CERTAINLY IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS BY THE SOUNDS OF IT WHETHER 
OR NOT ROBERT MUGABE IS WILLING TO 
STEP ASIDE AND ALLOW CHANGE TO 
HAPPEN THE CHANGE THAT MILLIONS OF 
ZIMBABWENS VOTED FOR THE CHANGE 
THAT MILLIONS OF ZIMBABWENS WANT SO 
DESPERATELY DESPERATELY CLEARLY WE WILL TRY FOR ANOTHER 
UPDATE BEFORE THE END OF THE 
PROGRAMME PROGRAMME LET'S MOVE ON TO THE DAY'S OTHER 
NEWS MIGRANT WORKERS BRING LITTLE 
OR NO ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO BRITAIN 
ACCORDING TO A NEW PARLIAMENTARY 
REPORT THE PRIME MINISTER CLAIMED 
AGAIN TODAY THAT IMMIGRATION IS 
NEEDED TO PREVENT LABOUR SHORTAGES 
BUT THE COMMITTEE SAYS THIS CASE IS 
FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED AND IT INSISTS 
THAT HIGH NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS HAVE 
DAMAGED THE PROSPECTS OF MANY YOUNG 
BRITISH WORKERS OUR ECONOMICS 
CORRESPONDENT HUGH PYM HAS MORE 
DETAILS DETAILS ONE SCHOOL AND FORTY LANGUAGES SPOKEN 
BY THE PUPILS EVIDENCE OF THE 
CHANGING FACE OF BRITAIN BROUGHT ON 
BY IMMIGRATION AT THIS PRIMARY IN 
READING MORE THAN HALF THE CHILDREN 
DON'T HAVE ENGLISH AS A FIRST 
LANGUAGE THE SCHOOL IS NEAR THE 
TOP OF THE BOROUGH'S LEAGUE TABLE 
BUT THE HEAD SAYS THEY COULD ALWAYS 
DO WITH MORE RESOURCES 
WE COPE 
WELL WITH WHAT WE DO AT THE MOMENT 
AND WE ARE SUCCESSFUL WE ACHIEVE 
WELL BUT SOMETIMES WE WONDER 
WOULD WE ACHIEVE BETTER IF WE HAD 
MORE RESOURCES AND THAT IS IN THE 
FORM OF PEOPLE COMING IN TO WORK 
WITH THE CHILDREN 
THE REPORT SAYS 
IMMIGRATION HAS MANY EFFECTS ON 
EVERYDAY LIFE FOR EXAMPLE 
PRESSURE ON PUBLIC SERVICES SUCH AS 
EDUCATION IT SAYS THERE MAY BE 
LESS TRAINING TRAINING FOR YOUNG 
WORKERS BECAUSE SOME EMPLOYERS ARE 
MORE INCLINED TO TAKE ON IMMIGRANTS 
AND IT ARGUES THAT THERE ARE 
SERIOUSLY INADEQUATE STATISTICS 
WHEN IT COMES TO MEASURING 
IMMIGRATION IMMIGRATION THE HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE SAYS 
ALL THIS MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO 
DIFFERENT GROUPS IN SOCIETY FIRST 
HIGHER INCOME EARNERS WHERE THERE 
IS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON WAGES 
BECAUSE OF HIGHER REWARDS FOR 
SKILLS SKILLS BUT OTHERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO LOSE 
OUT SOME LOWER INCOME EARNERS FOR 
EXAMPLE BECAUSE IMMIGRATION LOWERS 
THEIR WAGES 
THE REPORT LOOKS AT THE FUTURE 
ECONOMIC IMPACT FOR EXAMPLE ON THE 
HOUSING MARKET THE GOVERNMENT 
PREDICTS THERE WILL BE A NET INFLOW 
OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR THAT'S 
THE EXCESS OF PEOPLE COMING INTO 
THE U. K. OVER THOSE LEAVING SO HOUSE 
PRICES COULD BE TEN PER CENT HIGHER BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY EIGHT 
THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT 
THE CASE AGAINST IMMIGRATION COMES 
ACROSS STRONGLY IN TODAY'S FINDINGS 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS MIGRANT WORKERS 
HAVE BOOSTED THE SIZE OF THE 
ECONOMY BUT THE COMMITTEE SAYS 
THAT IS MEANINGLESS BECAUSE LIVING 
STANDARDS PERPERSON HAVEN'T CHANGED 
WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT IT IS DOING TO 
PROSPERITY WHAT IT IS DOING TO THE 
WEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE 
COUNTRY THERE IS NO ECONOMIC 
BENEFIT AT ALL THAT IS ESTABLISHED 
THE CASE FOR IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN 
MADE BY EMPLOYERS THEY ARGUE IT'S 
OFTEN HARD TO FIND THE RIGHT STAFF 
AND THEY NEED FOREIGN WORKERS TO 
TAKE UP THE SLACK 
SOMETIMES YOU 
FIND A JOB THAT YOU CAN'T FILL 
DOMESTICALLY WITH THE RIGHT PERSON 
EITHER AT LOW SKILL LEVEL OR HIGH 
SKILL LEVEL IN LAW OR BUSINESS 
MANAGEMENT 
THE PRIME MINISTER WAS MANAGEMENT ANXIOUS TO HIGHLIGHT THE POSITIVE 
CONTRIBUTION OF MIGRANT WORKERS I I THINK WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT THE 
FIGURES AND LOOK AT THE FACTS THEY 
WILL SEE THAT OVER THE LAST TEN 
YEARS BRITISH BRITISH GROWTH HAS 
BEEN HIGH IT'S BEEN HIGHER THAN 
MANY OTHER COUNTRIES THE IDEA THAT 
THESE SKILLS HAVE NOT HAD A 
POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY AS 
THE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE HAS SAID 
IS WRONG 
BUT WHILE MINISTERS SAID 
A NEW POINTS SYSTEM WOULD HELP 
CONTROL THE FLOW OF IMMIGRANT 
WORKERS THE CONSERVATIVES SAID THE 
BENEFITS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY TO 
ORDINARY BRITISH CITIZENS WERE 
LARGELY NON EXISTENT 
SCIENTISTS AT NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY 
HAVE BECOME THE FIRST IN BRITAIN TO 
CREATE PART HUMAN PART ANIMAL 
EMBRYOES THEY'RE BEING USED TO 
LOOK FOR CURES FOR ILLNESSES SUCH 
AS PARKINSON'S AND ALZHEIMER'S 
HYBRID EMBRYOES ARE HUGELY 
CONTROVERSIAL AND THE ROMAN 
CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS BEEN CRITICAL 
OF THE WORK OUR MED COAL 
CORRESPONDENT HAS THIS EXCLUSIVE 
STORY STORY THIS IS ABOUT AS CONTROVERSIAL AS 
SCIENCE GETS FOR THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH AND AND OTHER OTHER OTHER 
OPPONENTS THE RESEARCH IN THE 
BUILDING BEHIND ME INVOLVES 
EXPERIMENTS OF FRANKENSTEIN 
PROPORTIONS FOR SCIENTISTS IT'S 
ESSENTIAL PROGRESS WHICH COULD 
UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF MANY DISEASES 
THESE ARE HYBRID EMBRYOES UNDER THE 
MICROSCOPE PART HUMAN PART ANIMAL 
EACH SMALLER THAN A PINHEAD THEY 
WERE CREATED IN THIS LAB AT 
NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY THE TEAM 
WANTS TO USE THEM TO STUDY DISEASES 
LIKE PARKINSON'S STROKE AND 
DIABETES THESE DISHES CONTAIN 
SEVERAL HYBRID EMBRYOES WHICH 
SURVIVED FOR THREE DAYS NOW 
SCIENTISTS STRESS THEY WOULD NEVER 
IMPLANT THESE INTO A WOMAN THEY'RE 
PURELY FOR LABORATORY RESEARCH THE 
ONLY REASON WHY THEY USED COW EGGS 
IS BECAUSE HUMAN ONES ARE SUCH A 
SCARCE AND PRECIOUS RESOURCE 
SO HOW DID THEY DO IT AN 
UNFERTILISED COW'S EGG WAS CUT OPEN 
BY A LASER VIRTUALLY ALL THE 
GENETIC MATERIAL WAS SUCKED OUT 
THEN D. N. A. DERIVED FROM A HUMAN SKIN 
CELL WAS INJECTED INTO THE EGG BY 
USING AN ELECTRIC SHOCK THE HYBRID 
EMBRYO STARTED GROWING IT GREW FOR 
THREE DAYS TO THIRTY TWO CELLS THE EMBRYO 
IS NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE PER CENT HUMAN AND OH ONE PER CENT COW THEY 
HOPE TO GROW THEM FOR SIX DAYS TO 
EXTRACT THE STEM CELLS INSIDE 
THESE ARE THE BODY'S MASTER CELLS 
ABLE TO TURN INTO ANY TYPE OF 
TISSUE NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY 
REALISED SOME PEOPLE FEEL UNEASY 
ABOUT HYBRIDS BUT ARGUE THE 
EMBRYOES ARE NOTHING MORE THAN 
CLUMPS OF CELLS 
IF YOU LOOK DOWN 
IT LOOKS LIKE SEMOLINA AND IT STAYS 
LIKE THAT IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PILE OF CELLS 
BUT IT GIVES US THE TOOLS TO FIND 
OUT THE SIMPLE QUESTIONS HOW CAN 
WE BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DISEASE 
PROCESSES BY WORKING WITH THOSE 
CELLS IN THE LABORATORY 
THE ISSUE 
HAS ALREADY CAUSED A HUGE ROW IN 
THE COMMONS LAST WEEK THE PRIME 
MINISTER FINALLY PROMISED MPSA FREE 
VOTE ON WHETHER HYBRID RESEARCH 
SHOULD BE BANNED CRITICS INSIDE 
AND OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT ARGUE HYBRID 
EMBRYOES ARE UNKETETH UNETHICAL 
IT'S BAD SCIENCE THESE EMBRYOES 
ARE GOING TO BE TOTALLY GENETIC 
CONFUSED AND WILL NOT BEHAVE 
NORMALLY WILL NOT PRODUCE NORMAL 
STEM CELLS AND ARE ARE LIKELY TO 
GIVE THE SCIENTISTS ANY USEFUL 
DATA 
HUNDREDS OF PATIENT GROUPS DATA SUPPORT THE RESEARCH THIS WOMAN 
HAS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY AND DURING 
CHILDHOOD HAS GRADUALLY LOST THE 
ABILITY TO WALK FOR HER FATHER THE 
WORK ON HYBRIDS OFFERS THE CHANCE 
OF A BREAKTHROUGH 
THIS LOOKS LIKE 
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY THAT COULD BE 
DELAYED AND WHEN YOU HAVE A 
PROGRESSIVE CONDITION OR A DAUGHTER 
WITH A PROGRESSIVE CONDITION YOU 
ARE LOOKING FOR A CURE IN A 
REASONABLE TIMEFRAME BECAUSE EVERY 
YEAR THAT PASSES THAT CONDITION IS 
GETTING WORSE 
NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME DEVELOPMENTS 
INSIDE DEVELOPMENTS IN SCIENCE 
ARE OUTPACING THE DEBATE IN SOCIETY 
IT WILL NOW BE UP TO MILLIONS TO 
DECIDE WHETHER THIS WORK SHOULD BE 
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE OR BE BANNED 
FOR GOOD 
TWO ROYAL MARINES WHO WERE KILLED 
IN AN EXPLOSION IN SOUTHERN 
AFGHANISTAN HAVE BEEN NAMED AS TWENTY THREE 
YEAR OLD LIEUTENANT JOHN THORNTON 
AND TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD MARINE DAVID 
DAVID MARSH THEY WERE ON PATROL 
NEAR KAJAKI IN HELMAND WHEN THEIR 
VEHICLE WAS CAUGHT IN A BLAST 
PLANS TO WITHDREW MORE BRITISH 
FORCES FROM IRAQ HAVE BEEN PUT ON 
HOLD DES BROWNE TOLD M. P.'S THAT IT 
WAS THE RIGHT DECISION BECAUSE OF 
THE ONGOING SECURITY SITUATION IN 
BASRA IRAQI SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN 
FIGHTING SHIA MILITIAS IN THE 
REGION SUPPORTED BY BRITISH FORCES 
OUR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT IS AT 
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE WHAT DOES 
THIS TELL US ABOUT THE STATE OF 
THINGS IN BASRA 
WELL THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT CIRCUMSTANCES 
HAVE CHANGED IN IRAQ THEY 
UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE SINCE GORDON 
BROWN CONTROVERSIALLY ANNOUNCED A 
PHASED WITHDRAWAL OF BRITISH FORCES 
LAST OCTOBER AT THE HEIGHT OF 
ELECTION FEVER HE SKETCHED OUT A 
TIMETABLE WHICH WOULD HAVE HAD SOME 
BRITISH TROOPS WITHDRAWING ABOUT 
NOW BRINGING THE NUMBERS DOWN TO 
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THAT WAS BLOWN OFF 
COURSE BY THE SCALE OF THE FIGHTING 
IN BASRA OVER THE LAST WEEK WHEN 
IRAQI FORCES LAUNCHED A MAJOR 
OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE SHIA MILITIA 
OF MOQTADA AL SADR NOW BRITAIN WAS 
INVOLVED ACTIVELY IN SUPPORT OF 
THAT OPERATION WITH HELICOPTERS 
AND FAST JETS WITH TANKS AND 
ARTILLERY THE ARTILLERY WAS EVEN 
USED AS BRITAIN WAS DRAWN INTO THE 
FIGHTING THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING 
AND AGAINST THAT BACK TKPWROPB THE 
GOVERNMENT FELT THE THAT BACK 
GROWN GROUND THE GOVERNMENT 
SOME M. P.'S SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER IF 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAD NEVER SET 
OUT THAT TIMETABLE RATHER THAN 
BREAK IT L. THINK THE NEWS WILL BE 
PLEASING TO AMERICA'S TOP COMMANDER 
IN IRAQ GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS HE 
AFTER ALL IS LEADING AN AMERICAN 
TROOP SURGE AT THE MOMENT 
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT 
THERE ARE SIGNS OF DRAMATIC CHANGE 
IN ZIMBABWE AMID CLAIMS FROM THE 
OPPOSITION SOURCES THAT PRESIDENT 
MUGABE IS ABOUT TO STEP ASIDE 
AND COMING UP WE ARE ON BOARD WITH 
THE RED ARROWS ON A FLY PAST OVER 
LONDON TO MARK THE R. A. F.'S NINETIETH 
ANNIVERSARY 
ON B. B. C. LONDON HOW THE CAPITAL'S 
FAST BECOMING A FAIRTRADE CITY 
PLUS WHY IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL TO 
FEEL TENSE ON THE TUBE THE 
VIRTUAL RESEARCH THAT REVEALS OUR 
PARANOID BEHAVIOUR 
PAUL BURRELL WHO SERVED AS BUTLER 
TO DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES DID 
NOT TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH AT THE 
INQUEST INTO HER DEATH THAT'S THE 
VIEW OF THE CORONER LORD JUSTICE 
SCOTT BAKER WHO HAS BEEN SUMMING 
UP FOR A SECOND DAY HE DESCRIBED 
MR. BURRELL'S BEHAVIOUR AS PRETTY 
SHABBY SHABBY HE WAS JUST ONE OF NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
WITNESSES YET HIS EVIDENCE AND HIS 
BEHAVIOUR HAVE ATTRACTED 
CONSIDERABLE CRITICISM YESTERDAY 
THE CORONER SAID PAUL BURRELL HAD 
LIED IN THE WITNESS BOX TODAY HE 
ADDED 
PAUL BURRELL'S BEHAVIOUR THE 
CORONER ADDED HAD BEEN PRETTY 
SHABBY AND HIS EVIDENCE SHOULD BE 
TREATED WITH CAUTIOUS THE CORONER 
HAS ALSO DEALT WITH THE CENTRAL 
ISSUE OF HENRI PAUL AND ALCOHOL HE 
SAID THE MAN WHO DROVE THE MERCEDES 
WAS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN SERVED TWO 
LARGE MEASURES OF RICARD AT THE 
RITZ BAR THE EQUIVALENT HE SAID 
OF FOUR SINGLE WHISKIES 
LORD JUSTICE SCOTT BAKER SAID IT 
WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT THE FRENCH 
PATH OOLGS WHO IS CARRIED OUT THE 
FIRST POSTMORTEM ON HENRI PAUL HAD 
REFUSED TO GIVE EVIDENCE TO ANSWER 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BLOOD SAMPLES 
ONE ASPECT OF THE TOXICOLOGY AN BE 
A NORMALLY HIGH CARBON DIOXIDE 
READING REMAINED A MYSTERY HE 
SIDER DASH CARBON MONOXIDE 
ON THE CRASH ITSELF HE SAID THE 
EVIDENCE FROM WITNESSES RANGED FROM 
THE HONEST TO THE WORTHLESS 
LORD JUSTICE SCOTT BAKER IS 
EXPECTED TO FINISH HIS SUMMING UP 
TOMORROW MORNING AND THEN THE JURY 
WILL RETIRE TO CONSIDER ITS 
VERDICTS VERDICTS BRITAIN'S BIGGEST TEACHING UNION 
THE NUT IS CALLING ITS MEMBERS OUT 
ON STRIKE NEXT MONTH THE ONE DAY 
STOPPAGE WILL AFFECT ENGLAND AND 
WALES THE FIRST ON THIS SCALE FOR 
AROUND TWENTY ONE YEARS THE NUT IS 
DEMANDING TEN PER CENT PAY RISE IT SAYS 
ITS MEMBERS ARE STICK AND TIRED OF 
BELOW INFLATION PAY DEALS JAMES 
WESTHEAD IS HERE IF THIS GOES 
AHEAD WHAT IMPACT WILL IT HAVE A A BIG IMPACT THE NUT SAY THEY 
REPRESENT HALF OF ALL TEACHERS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES IF THEY CAN 
MOBILISE THEIR MEMBERS THEN THAT 
COULD MEAN THERE ARE MANY SCHOOLS 
CLOSING MANY PUPILS HAVING TO STAY 
AT HOME NOW THE NUT IS HOWEVER 
LOOKING RATHER ISOLATED BECAUSE 
ALL THE OTHER TEACHING UNIONS HAVE 
REJECTED STRIKE ACTION AND WELCOMED 
THIS PAY DEAL WHICH THEY ARGUE IS 
SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN MOST OTHER 
PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS AND WAS 
AFTER ALL RECOMMENDED BY AN 
INDEPENDENT PAY REVIEW BODY 
IS IT 
CERTAIN TO GO AHEAD 
IT IS POSSIBLE 
IT COULD BE AVERTED BUT IT IS 
LOOKING VERY UNLIKELY IT IS ALMOST 
CERTAIN IT WILL GO AHEAD IT IS A 
ONE DAY STRIKE APRIL TWENTY FOURTH THERE 
COULD BE SOME DISRUPTION FOR 
PUPILS' SCHOOLS DPUPILS SCHOOLS 
AND PARENTS 
THE SPEAKER OF THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS MICHAEL MARTIN 
IS GOING TO BE INVESTIGATED BY THE 
PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONER FOR 
STANDARDS ONLINE WILL CONSIDER 
WHETHER ANY RULES WERE BROKEN WHEN 
THE SPEAKER'S WIFE SPENT MORE THAN 
FOUR THOUSAND OF PUBLIC MONEY ON TAXI 
FAIRS JOHN L. S. M. YON WILL CONSIDER 
THREE MONTHS AGO IT EMERGED THAT 
THE SPEAKER'S WIFE MARY MARTIN HAD 
SPENT MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND ON TAXES IN 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND CLAIMED THE LOT ON 
EXPENSES AT FIRST THE SPEAKER'S 
SPOKESMAN SAID THAT MRS. MARTIN WAS 
ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS AND 
ACCOMPANIED BY A COMONCES' OFFICIAL 
BUT IT SOON BECAME CLEAR SHE WAS 
OUT SHOPPING COMMONS A SPOKESMAN 
RESIGNED CLAIMING HE HAD BEEN 
MISLED A COMPLAINT WAS LODGED WITH 
THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONER FOR 
STANDARDS 
THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS STANDARDS THAT MR. MARTIN MAY NOT HAVE BEEN 
USING HIS EXPENSES PROPERLY THAT'S 
WHAT WE HAVE ASKED TO INVESTIGATE 
AND IT WORRIES THE PUBLIC AS LONG 
AS THESE THINGS REMAIN BEHIND 
CLOSED DOORS THERE WILL BE CONCERN 
IN HIS REPLY THE COMMISSIONER SAID 
THAT HE ACCEPTED THAT MRS. MARTIN'S 
CONDUCT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THE M. P.S' CODE OF 
CONDUCT AND WOULD THEREFORE 
INVESTIGATE TONIGHT A SPOKESMAN 
FOR THE SPEAKER REFUSED TO MAKE ANY 
COMMENT EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THE 
SPEAKER'S OFFICE HAD RECEIVED AN 
INITIAL INQUIRY AND HAD RESPONDED 
TO THOSE QUESTIONS 
SEVEN YEARS ON SINCE HE WAS 
CEREMONIALLY DRAGGED TO HIS CHAIR 
THE QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER THE 
SPEAKER WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE 
LEADING HIS OWN REVIEW OF M. P.S' 
EXPENSES WHEN HE IS UNDER 
INVESTIGATION HIMSELF 
TWO YOUNG SISTERS HAVE FOUND A 
SEVERED HEAD OF A WOMAN ON A BEACH 
IN SCOTLAND THE DISCOVERY WAS MADE 
IN ARBROATH POLICE SAY A HAND HAS 
ALSO BEEN RECOVERED FROM THE BEACH 
AND THEY CONFIRM AN INVESTIGATION 
IS UNDER WAY 
THE ROYAL AIR FORCE IS CELEBRATING 
ITS NINE HUNDRED NINE BIRTHDAY TODAY AND MARKED 
THE ANNIVERSARY BY ORGANISING 
FLY PAST ALONG THE RIVER THAMES 
NINETIETH BIRTHDAY NICK RAVENSCROFT 
WAS WITH THEM IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE 
HE IS UNLIKELY TO FORGET 
THE PUBLIC FACE OF THE R. A. F. 
BREATHTAKING STUNTS AND PRECISION 
FLYING FLYING NINETY YEARS AGO IT WAS ALL A BIT LESS 
HIGH OCTANE 
AT THE END OF WORLD WAR ONE WHEN THE 
ROYAL AIR FORCE WAS FORMED THESE 
AVIATION RELICS WERE SEEN AS 
CUTTING EDGE THOUGH IT WAS THE 
SECOND WORLD WAR WHICH SHOWED HOW 
VITAL PLANES WERE IN WARFARE THE 
BATTLE OF BRITAIN FOUGHT IN THE 
SKIES PROMPTING WINSTON 
CHURCHILL'S FAMOUS ADDRESS NEVER NEVER IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN CONFLICT WAS 
SO MUCH OWED BY SO MANY TO SO FEW 
THE RED ARROWS LED TODAY'S 
ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS 
ALL OF 
THE PILOTS ON MY SQUADRON HAVE 
SERVED IN EXERCISES AS WELL AS SOME 
OF MY GROUND CREW MY ENGINEER AND 
SUPPORT STAFF ARE SERVING IN IRAQ 
AND AFGHANISTAN 
WE SET OUT FROM 
THE RED ARROWS' HOME NEAR LINCOLN 
ACCOMPANIED BY FOUR OF THE NEW 
GENERATION OF TYPHOON JETS FLYING 
OVER R. A. F. BASES DOTTED ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY THEN A SALUTE IN THE SKIES 
ABOVE THE CAPITAL 
WE ARE NOT JUST FOUR HUNDRED METRES ABOVE 
THE RIVER THAMES WITH LONDON'S 
LANDMARKS FLASHING BY ON EITHER 
SIDE AT HALF THE SPEED OF SOUND 
AFTER THREE YEARS IN THE RED ARROWS 
IT IS BACK TO NORMAL OPERATIONS 
BUT THIS IS THE SHOW OFF SIDE OF 
PILOT LIFE AND BOY DO THEY ENJOY 
IT AND SO THE R. A. F. NINETY YEARS OLD 
TODAY AND CELEBRATING IN STYLE 
NICK RAVENSCROFT B. B. C. NEWS WITH 
THE RED ARROWS 
IN SCOTLAND PRESCRIPTION CHARGES 
HAVE BEEN CUT BY NEARLY TWO IT IS 
FIRST IN A SERIES OF PRICE 
REDUCTIONS AND THE TARGET IS FREE 
PRESCRIPTIONS FOR ALL BY TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN 
PEOPLE WILL NOW PAY FIVE THE PRICE 
VARIES AROUND THE COUNTRY IN 
ENGLAND THE COST HAS GONE UP TODAY 
TO SEVEN POINT ONE OH IN WALES IT IS NOW A YEAR 
SINCE FREE PRESCRIPTIONS WERE 
INTRODUCED IN NORTHERN IRELAND THE 
COST REMAINS SIX POINT EIGHT FIVE A PRICE FREEZE 
HAS BEEN SET IN PLACE NOW LET'S 
TRY AND RETURN TO OUR MAIN STORY 
THE AT DRAMIC EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE 
WHERE THERE ARE CLAIMS FROM 
OPPOSITION SOURCES THAT PRESIDENT 
MUGABE MAY BE ABOUT TO STEP ASIDE 
AND THAT THERE ARE SOME 
NEGOTIATIONS APPARENTLY UNDER WAY 
AS WE SPEAK SO LET'S JOIN THE 
B. B. C.'S IAN PANNELL WHO IS INSIDE 
ZIMBABWE FOR US IAN COULD YOU 
GIVE US THE LATEST THAT YOU HAVE ON 
WHAT KIND OF TALKS MAY BE HAPPENING 
RIGHT NOW 
YES I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO THREE 
UNNAMED SOURCES WITHIN THE 
OPPOSITION MOVEMENT MOVEMENT IN 
ZIMBABWE AND THEY ALL HAVE FAIRLY 
SIMILAR STORY THEY ALL CLAIM THAT 
THEY HAVE ALMOST REACHED A DEAL FOR 
PRESIDENT MUGABE TO STAND DOWN MY 
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THAT TALKS 
HAVE BEEN BROKERED BY SOUTH AFRICAN 
NEGOTIATORS OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS 
IN THE CAPITAL HARARY HOWEVER 
JOHANNESBURG HAS DENIED ANY 
INVOLVEMENT IN HARARE 
REPRESENTIVES FROM THE POLICE HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSIONS 
AND DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING 
PLACE BETWEEN THE RULING PARTY AND 
THE OPPOSITION LEADER MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI THE DEAL AS OUTLINED 
BY THE M. D. C. WOULD INVOLVE ROBERT 
MUGABE MAKING A PUBLIC ANNOUNCING 
HE IS STANDING ASIDE ALTHOUGH IT 
REMAINS UNCLEAR WHEN THIS WOULD 
TAKE PLACE THE SOURCES ALSO 
HOWEVER ARE URGING CAUTIOUS 
SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 
PARTY COULD CHANGE THEIR MINDS AND 
THAT DEAL ISN'T CAST IRON UNTIL A 
DECLARATION IS MADE 
IAN WE HAD JOHN SIMPSON EARLIER 
TELLING US AND AS YOU WERE SAYING 
THERE THAT MR. MUGABE IS A CUNNING 
AND ABLE NEGOTIATOR DO YOU THINK 
HE WILL BE ABLE TO EXTRACT 
SOMETHING FROM THE TALKS WHAT 
WOULD HE LIKE TO EMERGE WITH IF HE 
IS GOING TO HAND OVER POWER WELL WELL FIRST OF ALL I THINK IT STILL 
REMAINS AN IF AND WE SHOULD 
STRESS THAT AND EVEN THOUGH THE 
OPPOSITION CONCEDES THAT THIS MAN 
HAS OUTWITED THEM IN THE PAST HE 
REMAINS A VERY SHREWD AND CLEVER 
MAN THE SENSE I'M GETTING FROM THE 
OPPOSITION IS THAT THEY DON'T WANT 
TO BE SEEN AS PUNGISHING ROBERT 
MUGABE THEY EVEN TALK PUNISHING 
ROBERT MUGABE THEY EVEN TALK ABOUT 
THE POSSIBILITY OF ALLOWING HIM TO 
STAY ON IN THE COUNTRY ABOVE ALL 
WHAT THEY WANT IS UNITY FOR THE 
COUNTRY 
IAN PANNELL THERE INSIDE COUNTRY ZIMBABWE MONITORING THOSE EVENTS 
MORE ON NEWS TWENTY FOUR AS THE EVENING 
PROGRESSES NOW LET'S LOOK AT THE 
WEATHER AND IT IS SUSAN TODAY 
WEATHER AND IT IS SUSAN TODAY NOT A BAD LOOKING DAY FOR MOST OF 
THE U. K. TEMPERATURES HAVE GOT INTO 
THE MID TEENS WE WILL KEEP THE 
TEMPERATURES BUT THE SUNSHINE WILL 
BE IN MUCH SHORTER SUPPLY PLENTY 
OF CLOUD PILING IN FROM THE WEST A 
FEW GLIMMERS OF BRIGHTNESS OUTSIDE 
AT THE MOMENT AS SOON AS THE SUN 
SETS CLOUD ADVANCING FROM THE WEST 
MOST OF THE U. K. WILL BE COVERED BY 
DAWN AND WE WILL ALL SEE THE CLOUD 
THICK ENOUGH TO BRING US LIGHT RAIN 
INTO NORTHERN IRELAND WALES AND 
THE SOUTH WEST OVERNIGHT THANKS TO 
THE CLOUD IT'LL BE MILD LOWS OF 
AROUND SIX OR SEVEN AS FOR 
TOMORROW ANY CHANGES WILL BE 
RATHER SLOW WE WILL SEE OUR CLOUD 
CONTINUING TO GRADUALLY CREEP 
EASTWARDS THROUGH THE DAY WE WILL 
SEE ANY RAIN IN THE WEST GRADUALLY 
PETERING OUT BUT OVERALL WHAT WE 
WILL END UP WITH I THINK IS AL DRY 
DAY WITH A LOT OF CLOUD THE BEST 
PLACES TO SEE THE SUNSHINE WILL BE 
EASTERN SCOTLAND WITH SHELTER IT 
SHOULD BE A PRETTY FAIR DAY THE 
SAME GOES FOR THOSE AREAS SHELTERED 
BY THE PENNINES IF WE HEAD FURTHER 
WEST WE WILL HAVE THAT CHANCE OF A 
FEW SPOTS OF RAIN AND MORE CLOUD 
AROUND LINCOLNSHIRE AND EAST 
ANGLIA FAIRING WELL THROUGH 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON SOUTHERN 
ENGLAND HOWEVER WILL KEEP A LOT OF 
THICK CLOUD THROUGHOUT THE COURSE 
OF THE DAY AND PARTICULARLY ACROSS 
THE LIKES OF THE SALISBURY PLAIN 
AND THE MOORS OF THE SOUTH WEST 
THAT CLOUD WILL BE LOW AND I THINK 
THE VISIBILITY COULD BE QUITE POOR 
AND WE WILL HAVE DRIZZLE ON AND OFF 
IT WILL BE A SIMILAR MIXTURE ACROSS 
THE MOUNTAINS OF WALES AND FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND A GREY AFTERNOON 
AS WELL TEMPERATURES THROUGHOUT 
ALL OF THIS THOUGH STILL DOING 
WELL IN THE LOW TO MID TEENS ALMOST 
EVERYWHERE SIMILAR TEMPERATURES ON 
THURSDAY A SIMILAR STORY AND A 
LARGELY DRY DAY BUT ONE FEATURING A 
LOT OF CLOUD NOT A CHANGE FOR 
FRIDAY BUT A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM 
COME SATURDAY A NORTHERLY WIND 
PICKS UP AND IT'LL START IT FEEL 
MUCH COLDER AND BY SUNDAY COULD IT 
BE A REPEAT OF EASTER IT LOOKS 
LIKE WE COULD SEE SNOWFALL SINKING 
SOUTH ACROSS THE U. K. 
LET'S HAVE REMINDER OF THE MAIN 
NEWS SOURCES INSIDE ZIMBABWE ARE 
TELLING THE B. B. C. THAT PRESIDENT 
MUGABE MAY BE ABOUT TO STEP ASIDE 
THREE DAYS AFTER THE ELECTIONS TOOK 
PLACE OPPOSITION SOURCES ARE 
TELLING US THAT A POSSIBLE DEAL TO 
TRANSFER POWER FROM MR. MUGABE TO
