TWELVE THOUSAND ARE DEAD AFTER YESTERDAY'S 
EARTHQUAKE MANY THOUSANDS MORE 
UNACCOUNTED FOR 
A MASSIVE RESCUE OPERATION IS UNDER 
WAY NEARLY NINETEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE 
REPORTED TO BE BURIED IN ONE CITY 
ALONE ALONE INFLATION LEAPS TO THREE PER CENT BROUGHT ON 
BY HIGH FOOD AND FUEL COSTS 
DISTORTED AND DAMAGING THE VERDICT 
OF M. P.'S ON NATIONAL TESTING IN 
SCHOOLS SCHOOLS AND AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE 
CONGESTION CHARGE A TAX ON PARKING 
ON B. B. C. LONDON POLICE SEARCHED FOR 
THE KILLERS OF A MAN STABBED IN 
BROAD DAYLIGHT ON OXFORD STREET 
AND MODERN DAY PASSPORT TO PIMLICO 
HOW SHOREDITCH RESIDENTS ARE 
FIGHTING PLANS FOR A SKYSCRAPER 
HELLO THE AUTHORITIES IN CHINA SEA 
ALMOST TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED SO FAR IN THE EARTHQUAKE 
WHICH STRUCK THE SOUTH WEST OF THE 
COUNTRY YESTERDAY THE EPICENTRE 
WAS IN SICHUAN PROVINCE STATE 
MEDIA SAID MORE THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE 
ARE BURIED IN THE CITY OF MIANYANG 
IN THE COUNTY OF WENCHUAN TWO THOUSAND 
PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND 
ARE BURIED IN ONE CITY ALONE 
BEICHUAN COUNTY APPEARS TO HAVE 
SUFFERED THE WORST DAMAGE AT LEAST 
THREE THOUSAND HAVE BEEN KILLED THERE CHINA 
HAS DEPLOYED FIFTY THOUSAND TROOPS TO HELP 
WITH RELIEF EFFORTS 
THE ENORMITY OF CHINA'S LOSS IS NOW 
SINKING IN UNDER THE THIN COVER OF 
A TEMPORARY SHELTER A WOMAN SITS 
SURROUNDED BY THE BODIES OF LOCAL 
CHILDREN THESE TEENAGERS DIED WHEN 
THEIR SCHOOL COLLAPSED NINE HUNDRED 
CLASSMATES AND THEIR TEACHERS WERE 
KILLED THIS IS ONLY A TINY PART OF 
THE HORROR IN ANOTHER SCHOOL ONE THOUSAND 
STUDENTS WERE BURIED UNDER RUBBLE 
AT LEAST FOUR SCHOOLS COLLAPSED 
NOBODY KNOWS HOW MANY CHILDREN HAVE 
BEEN LOST SOME HAVE BEEN SAVED 
THERE IS A RELIEF AS EXHAUSTED 
RESCUERS PULLED A SMALL GIRL FROM 
THE DEBRIS CHINA HAS THROWN 
EVERYTHING IT HAS CUT THIS DISASTER 
PEOPLE ARE TOO FRIGHTENED TO RETURN 
TO THEIR DAMAGED HOMES FUND 
HUNDREDS OF AFTERSHOCKS MAKES IT 
TOO DANGEROUS TO GO BACK IN 
BEIJING THE GOVERNMENT SAID ALL 
OFFERS OF INTERNATIONAL HELP ARE 
WELCOME WELCOME WE WOULD LIKE TO 
EXPRESS OUR THANKS FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WE HAVE 
RECEIVED WE WILL BE MAKING EVERY 
EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THE AID WE HAVE 
GOT GET TO THE RIGHT PLACES AS 
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
CHINA'S PRIME MINISTER IS ON THE 
SCENE HE TOLD RESCUE WORKERS THAT 
EVERY SECOND LOST COULD COST 
ANOTHER CHILD'S LIFE THERE HAS 
NEVER BEEN A MOBILISATION LIKE IT 
BUT THIS IS DIFFICULT COUNTRY HIGH 
IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH BLOCKED 
ROADS HEAVY RAIN HAS MEANT EVEN 
HELICOPTERS COULD NOT GET TO THE 
WORST AREAS SO CHINESE TROOPS 
MARCHED ON FOOT THROUGH MOUNTAIN 
PASSES AND FINALLY REACHED THE 
EPICENTRE OF THE QUAKE BUT STILL 
THERE ARE NO NUMBERS ON CASUALTIES 
THE GOVERNMENT IN BEIJING REALISES 
THIS DISASTER IS FAR WORSE THAN IT 
INITIALLY THOUGHT IN ONE CITY 
ALONE AS MANY AS TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE MAY 
LIE TRAPPED UNDER RUBBLE EVEN WITH 
ITS ENORMOUS RESOURCES CHINA NOW 
ACCEPTS THIS IS A CATASTROPHE TO 
BID FOR IT TO HANDLE ON ITS OWN 
TOO BIG 
MICHAEL BRISTOW HAS RECENTLY 
ARRIVED IN DUJIANGYAN FIFTY MILES 
FROM THE EPICENTRE OF THE 
EARTHQUAKE JUST DESCRIBED THE 
SCENES FOR US 
WHAT I COULD SEE IT 
IS LIKE ORGANISED CHAOS PEOPLE 
HERE ARE LEAVING THEY ARE GETTING 
THEIR BELONGINGS TOGETHER AND 
HEADING OUT OTHER PEOPLE WHO CAN'T 
LEAVE ARE SETTING UP IN MAKESHIFT 
CAMPS THEY ARE SETTING UP A TENTS 
TARPAULIN AND PLASTIC STRETCHING 
IT ACROSS TREES AND CAMPING OUT IN 
THE RAIN IN THIS AREA THIS IS 
CLOSE TO THE EPICENTRE OF THE 
EARTHQUAKE TODAY WE WENT INTO THE 
CENTRE OF TOWN AND SAW THAT A GOOD 
NUMBER OF BUILDINGS HAD FALLEN DOWN 
INTO THE STREET ONE OF THOSE IN 
PARTICULAR WAS A HOSPITAL ONE HUNDRED 
PEOPLE WERE TRAPPED UNDERNEATH AND 
PEOPLE WERE DESPERATELY WAITING 
OUTSIDE FOR NEWS OF PEOPLE WHO 
COULD HAVE BEEN TRAPPED INSIDE AND 
PERHAPS WORSE STILL ALIVE TODAY 
THEY ONLY GOT ONE BODY OUT OF A 
HOSPITAL 
WE ARE HEARING TERRIBLE HOSPITAL STORIES OF PEOPLE BEING IN CONTACT 
WITH LOVED ONES WHO ARE TRAPPED AND 
ON THEIR MOBILE PHONES BUT NOBODY 
ABLE TO REACH THEM HOW DOES IT 
APPEAR THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES ARE 
COPING IN TERMS OF THE RESCUE 
EFFORT 
JUST TO GO BACK TO THAT EFFORT STORY SOMEBODY EARLIER TODAY TOLD 
ME HE SAID HIS UNCLE WAS TRAPPED 
UNDER AN APARTMENT BLOCK AND HE 
COULD CONTACT HIM ON HIS MOBILE 
PHONE HE KNEW HE WAS INJURED BUT 
HE COULDN'T GET TO HIM HE WENT TO 
A RESCUE CENTRE DESPERATE TO TRY 
AND GET ANYBODY TO HELP GET HIS 
UNCLE OUT IT MUST BE SAID THAT THE 
CHINESE AUTHORITIES SEEM TO BE 
DOING A GREAT DEAL AND SEEMED TO BE 
GETTING MEN AND MATERIAL TO THE 
AFFECTED AREAS THOSE THEY CAN GET 
TO THIS TOWN DUJIANGYAN THERE 
ARE PLENTY OF DIGGERS AND 
EXCAVATORS PEOPLE WORKING TO TRY 
AND GET UNDER THE RUBBLE AND LOOK 
FOR SURVIVORS THE FURTHER UP THE 
ROAD NORTH OF HERE IN WENCHUAN 
IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO GET TO L. 
THINK IT IS A BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO 
SAY WHAT THE SITUATION IS THERE 
THANK YOU 
YOU CAN STAY UP TO DATE WITH THE 
DETAILS ON THE SITUATION IN CHINA 
ON THE WEBSITE 
HERE THE COST OF LIVING HAS SURGED 
UNEXPECTEDLY AND IS AT ITS HIGHEST 
RATE FOR MORE THAN YEAR FIGURES 
RELEASED THIS MORNING SHOW THE RATE 
OF INFLATION HAS INCREASED FROM TWENTY FIVE 
PER CENT TO THREE PER CENT WELL ABOVE EXPECTATIONS 
THE RISE HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY HIGHER 
FUEL AND FOOD COSTS HE IS RICHARD 
SCOTT SCOTT INFLATION FEARS MEAN IT IS NEARLY 
TIME FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
GOVERNOR TO WRITE ANOTHER LETTER TO 
THE CHANCELLOR THE BANK HAS TO 
KEEP INFLATION AT TWO PER CENT BUT TODAY'S 
FIGURES SHOWED PRICES HAVE GOT UP 
BY THREE PER CENT OVER THE LAST YEAR BIG 
JUMP FROM LAST MONTH'S FIGURE OF 
TWO POINT FIVE PER CENT IF IT GOES UP ANY MORE THE 
GOVERNOR HAS TO WRITE A LETTER TO 
THE CHANCELLOR EXPLAINING THINGS 
HORRIFIC NUMBERS IT IS ALMOST 
RACING CERTAINTY THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND WILL HAVE TO WRITE TO THE 
CHANCELLOR BECAUSE WE WILL GO 
ABOVE THE UPPER BOUNDARY OF THE 
INFLATION TARGET RANGE AND 
PROBABLY STAY THERE FOR A 
CONSIDERABLE PERIOD WE WILL 
PROBABLY SEE A SECOND RECORD WE 
HAVE NEVER HAD THAT BEFORE NO 
GETTING AWAY FROM IT 
WHAT IS 
CAUSING THIS EVERY MONTH THE 
STATISTICS EXPERTS GO OUT AND GET 
THE PRICES OF THINGS WE SPEND OUR 
MONEY ON THEY FOUND THAT OVER THE 
LAST YEAR FOOD AND SOFT DRINKS 
HAVE GONE UP BY MORE THAN SIXTY FIVE PER CENT 
UTILITY BILLS GAS ELECTRICITY AND 
WATER HAVE GOT UP BY MORE THAN FIVE PER CENT 
PRICES IN TRANSPORT WENT UP BY MORE 
THAN SIX PER CENT THOSE PRICE RISES HIT 
PEOPLE ON LOWER INCOMES THE HARDEST 
AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE THE PRICE OF 
FUTURE A FOOD AND FUEL IS GOING 
UP QUICKLY TYPICALLY POORER 
PEOPLE SPEND A LARGE AMOUNT OF 
THEIR MONEY ON THOSE GOODS SO THEY 
WILL EXPERIENCE HIGHER INFLATION 
SO WHAT CAN BE DONE THE ANSWER 
MIGHT BE NOT A LOT LAST WEEK THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND KEPT INTEREST RATES 
UNCHANGED AT FIVE PER CENT MANY PEOPLE WERE 
HOPING FOR A CUT BUT THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND ALREADY KNEW ABOUT TODAY'S 
FIGURE THAT MEANS RATE CUTS IN THE 
FUTURE MAY BE POSTPONED OR 
CANCELLED 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND WILL CANCELLED HAVE TO KEEP INTEREST RATES ON HOLD 
POSSIBLY FOR A FEW MONTHS THEY ARE 
CAUGHT BETWEEN WEAKER ECONOMIC 
GROWTH BUT HIGHER INFLATION ONE 
REQUIRES LOWER INTEREST RATES ONE 
REQUIRES HIGHER RATES THEY WILL 
DRIVE A COURSE THROUGH THE MIDDLE 
THE WORRY NOW IS THAT PEOPLE SEE 
INFLATION GOING UP AND ASK FOR A 
BIGGER PAY RISES WHICH CAN FEED 
BACK INTO INFLATION AND ADD TO THE 
PROBLEM PROBLEM THE GOVERNMENT'S SYSTEM OF NATIONAL 
SCHOOL TESTS S. A. T.'S IS DISTORTING 
CHILDREN'S EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND 
HAVING A DAMAGING EFFECT ON 
INDIVIDUAL PUPILS' INDIVIDUAL 
HEALTH A GROUP OF M. P.'S SAY TEACHERS 
ARE BEING FORCED TO NARROWED THE 
CURRICULUM AND NARROW CREATIVITY 
FOR EVERY ELEVEN YEAR OLD IN ENGLAND 
LIKE EMILY THIS IS A TESTING TIME 
ALL WEEK SHE HAS S. A. T.'S TESTS IN 
ENGLISH MATHS AND SCIENCE HER 
FIRST IS IN WRITING 
THEY ARE QUITE 
EASY FOR ME BECAUSE I AM QUITE A 
GOOD WRITER AND I ENJOYED WRITING 
STORIES AND THINGS 
THEY LEARNING 
NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED I UNDERSTAND 
THAT BUT AT EMILY'S AGE TEN TO ELEVEN 
IT IS A LOT OF PRESSURE TO PUT THEM 
UNDER TO PERFORM JUST IN THAT 
PARTICULAR TIME WITH NO REGARD TO 
ACHIEVEMENTS THEY HAVE MADE IN 
YEARS BEFORE 
SIT UPRIGHT PUT 
CHOPIN'S DOWN 
THIS YEAR THE 
TESTS THEMSELVES ARE UNDER SCRUTINY 
PUT YOUR PENS DOWN A GROUP OF 
M. P.'S ARE CALLING FOR URGENT REFORM 
ALTHOUGH STOPPING SHORT OF CALLING 
FOR S. A. T.'S TO BE SCRAPPED THEY SAY 
NATIONAL TESTS DISTORT EDUCATION 
AND LEAD TO A NARROWING OF 
CURRICULUM AND FOR THOSE WHO 
STRUGGLE CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR 
PROBLEMS 
THEY ARE USED TO ASSESS PROBLEMS INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OF CHILDREN 
BUT ALSO TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE 
OF SCHOOLS BATE SAID SCHOOLS 
AGAINST OTHER SCHOOLS LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES AGAINST OTHER LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES BATES SAID SCHOOLS 
THIS CRITICISM ADDS TO CHORUS OF 
CONCERN ABOUT NATIONAL TESTS THERE 
HAS BEEN A BATTERY OF WARNINGS FROM 
OFFICIAL BODIES THAT FAR FROM 
RAISING STANDARDS THEY MAY 
ACTUALLY BE HARMING CHILDREN'S 
EDUCATION THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW 
PILOTING A LESS PRESSURED APPROACH 
CALLED TESTING WHEN READY WHERE 
TEACHERS CHOOSE WHEN PUPILS SHOULD 
SIT THEM BUT TODAY'S REPORT 
REJECTS THAT APPROACH TOO WE WE BELIEVE THAT REINFORCES THE CULTURE 
OF TESTING IT IS ABOUT TIME 
TESTING WAS ON A LOWER LEVEL AND WE 
STARTED HAVING MUCH MORE 
AVAILABILITY OF FULL CURRICULUM 
INTERPRETED BY GOOD TEACHERS EMILY EMILY AND HER FRIENDS DID NOT APPEAR TOO 
STRESSED TODAY BUT THE REAL 
PRESSURE OF THESE TESTS IS ON 
SCHOOLS NOT PUPILS THE QUESTION 
NOW IS WHETHER THAT PRESSURE IS 
SPURRING ACHIEVEMENT OR DIVERTING 
SCHOOLS FROM THE REAL BUSINESS OF 
EDUCATION EDUCATION LET'S HEAR FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE 
SCHOOLS MINISTER JIM KNIGHT IS IN 
WESTMINSTER YOU WILL BE WELL AWARE 
IT IS NOT JUST THESE M. P.'S WHO HAVE 
CONCERNS OVER ONE HUNDRED CONTRIBUTORS TO 
THE INQUIRY FOUND THERE IS 
OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THE SYSTEM IS 
DAMAGING CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND 
AFFECTING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND 
YET YOU SEEM HAPPY TO DISMISS THIS 
I WAS PLEASED THE SELECT COMMITTEE 
SAID THEY THOUGHT THE CASE FOR 
NATIONAL TESTING WAS SOUND AND 
PERSUASIVE AND THAT COULD USE OF 
TESTING ALSO IMPROVES TEACHING AND 
THEREFORE THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION 
BUT OBVIOUSLY WE WILL LISTEN 
CAREFULLY TO WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY 
I WAS DISAPPOINTED THEY DID NOT 
TAKE EVIDENCE FROM OFSTED THEY ARE 
INDEPENDENT THEY HAVE SAID THAT 
MOST SCHOOLS HAVE GOOD OR 
OUTSTANDING WELL BEING OF THEIR 
CHILDREN WHICH SUGGESTS THE SORT 
OF STRESS SOME PEOPLE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT IS NOT THERE IN THE 
WIDESPREAD NATURE IT IS BEING 
PAINTED 
WHAT CONCERNS WHEN YOU PAY PAINTED HEED TO 
WE WILL LOOK AT IT IN THE 
CONTEXT OF THE NEW FORM OF TESTING 
JAMES WAS TALKING ABOUT IN THE 
PIECE YOU JUST PLAYED THE TESTING 
WHEN READY SINGLE LEVEL TESTS AND 
WHAT WE WANT TO DO WITH THOSE IS BE 
ABLE TO REDUCE SOME OF THE PRESSURE 
BECAUSE THEY WILL BE SMALLER TESTS 
NOT EVERYBODY WILL TAKE THEM AT 
ONCE WE WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO 
MEASURE THE PROGRESS EVERY SINGLE 
CHILD IS MAKING THROUGH THEIR 
EDUCATION BETWEEN THE AGES OF SEVEN AND 
FOURTEEN WITH MATHS AND ENGLISH WE THINK 
THAT THAT IS GOING TO PROGRESS 
THINGS MUCH BETTER FOR CHILDREN 
BECAUSE IN THE END THE IMPORTANT 
THING IS THAT THEY ARE IMPROVING IN 
THEIR LEARNING ALL THE TIME 
THROUGHOUT THEIR SCHOOL TIME THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AN OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER HAS BEEN 
SERIOUSLY INJURED IN A CAR BOMB 
ATTACK IN NORTHERN IRELAND IT 
EXPLODED UNDER THE OFFICER'S PARK 
AS HE LEFT HIS HOME IN COUNTY 
TYRONE OFFICER'S CAR NO GROUP 
HAS ADMITTED CARRYING OUT THE 
ATTACK HE IS IN HOSPITAL 
THE MAN WHO OVERSAW THE OPENING OF 
HEATHROW TERMINAL FIVE IS STEPPING 
DOWN THE AIRPORT OPERATOR B. A. A. SAYS 
MARK BULLOCK HAS CHOSEN TO LEAVE 
PROBLEMS WITH BAGGAGE HANDLING 
CAUSED FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS AND 
DELAYS WHEN TERMINAL FIVE OPENED IN 
MARCH MARCH THE JURY IN THE TRIAL OF EIGHT MEN 
ACCUSED OF PLOTTING TO BLOW UP 
PASSENGER PLANES HAVE BEEN SHOWN A 
VIDEO OF A REPLICA BOMB EXPLODING 
GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS USED THE SAME 
SOFT DRINK BOTTLES AND LIQUID 
CHEMICALS AS THOSE THE DEFENDANTS 
WERE ALLEGEDLY PLANNING TO DETONATE 
ON BOARD TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHTS 
DANIEL SANDFORD IS AT WOOLWICH 
CROWN COURT PRESUMABLY THIS WAS TO 
DEMONSTRATE HOW THE MEN MIGHT HAVE 
GONE ABOUT BLOWING UP THESE PLANES 
YES WHEN THESE EIGHT MEN WERE 
ARRESTED THAT WAS WHEN THE BAN ON 
CARRYING LIQUIDS IN HAND LUGGAGE ON 
AIRCRAFT WAS INTRODUCED THE 
QUESTION SINCE THEN HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A LIQUID 
BOMB AND CARRY IT IN SOFT DRINKS 
BOTTLE WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT A 
SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS THAT WERE 
DONE AT THE FORENSIC EXPLOSIVES 
LABORATORY THE FIRST TESTS USING 
HYDROGEN PEROXIDE AND THE DRINK 
POWDER CALLED TANG AND MIXTURE OF 
CITRIC ACID AND HEXAMINE AS A 
DETONATOR THE FIRST ZERO TESTS 
DIDN'T WORK AS THE INCREASED THE 
STRENGTH OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE SO 
THAT THE SINAK THE DETONATIONS 
BEGAN THE VIDEO WE SAW THIS 
MORNING THEY SET UP A TEST IN A 
BOMB ROOM YOU SEE THE OASIS DRINKS 
BOTTLE SITTING IN THE TEST WEEK 
SURROUNDING IT ARE THICK BITS OF 
PLASTIC THE WHOLE THING IS FILMED 
FROM SIX DIFFERENT CAMERA ANGLES 
ONE OF THOSE CAMERAS IS INSTANTLY 
DESTROYED BY THE RESULTING 
EXPLOSION ANOTHER ONE IS BEHIND 
THICK GLASS THE DOUBLE LAMINATED 
GLASS IN FRONT CRACKS FROM THE 
FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION IN OTHER 
CAMERA ANGLES YOU SEE THESE THICK 
SHEETS OF PLASTIC TUMBLING DOWN 
AROUND THE ROOM AND FLYING IN SLOW 
MOTION BITS OF PLASTIC BOTTLE AND 
METAL FROM THE TEST TO THE 
LAYMAN'S I IT LOOKS LIKE A 
SIGNIFICANT EXPLOSION EYE 
BEING HAILED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO 
THE CONGESTION CHARGE BUT MAY PROVE 
TO BE JUST AS CONTROVERSIAL 
NOTTINGHAM CITY COUNCIL HAS VOTED 
TO INTRODUCE A TAX ON PARKING 
SPACES IN THE HOPE OF CUTTING 
CONGESTION AND RAISING FUNDS FOR 
THE CITY'S TRAMS BUSINESSES WILL 
BE ASKED TO PAY AN ANNUAL FEE OF 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE PER SPACE TOM SYMONDS IS IN 
NOTTINGHAM FOR US 
DIVIDING OPINION THIS ONE YES YES NOTTINGHAM IS A THRIVING CITY IT 
HAS ALL OF THE PROBLEMS OF ANY 
BRITISH CITY INCLUDING TRAFFIC 
CONGESTION IT'S PLANNED TO TAX 
COMMUTER PARKING SPACES HAS PUT IT 
OUT ON ITS OWN THIS PLAN HAS BEEN 
ON THE DRAWING BOARD FOR NINE YEARS 
IN THAT TIME IT HASN'T GOT ANY 
LESS CONTROVERSIAL 
THE RUSH HOUR THIS MORNING IN 
HOTTING HAM CITY CENTRE MORE 
PEOPLE ARE DRIVING EACH YEAR AND 
THE COUNCIL SOMETHING HAS TO BE 
DONE ABOUT IT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IN BRITAIN THESE VALUABLE BITS OF 
TARMAC WILL BE TAXED ANY BUSINESS 
WITH MORE THAN TEN WILL HAVE TO PAY 
BUSINESSES LIKE THE GIANT IMPERIAL 
TOBACCO PLANT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF 
NOTTINGHAM THE COUNCIL SAYS IT 
WILL AFFECT FIVE HUNDRED OF THE 
BIGGEST COMPANIES IN NOTTINGHAM 
WHAT WILL IT COST THIS COMPANY 
EVERY SING ONE OF THESE SPACES WILL 
BE TAXED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE A YEAR THERE ARE SEVEN HUNDRED 
SPACES THERE ARE IMPERIAL TOBACCO 
WILL PAY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND EXCEPT THAT THIS 
COMPANY IS PLANNING TO PASS THE 
COST ON TO ITS EMPLOYEES IF THE 
WORKFORCE ACCEPT IT AND THAT IS 
BIG IF THEY WILL PAY AN ESTIMATED 
SEVENTY FIVE PENCE A DAY BUT THE MANAGEMENT 
IS NOT HAPPY 
WE FEEL VERY AGGRIEVED EFFECTIVELY 
WE'VE MOVED TO AN OUT OF TOWN 
LOCATION PROVIDED A LOT OF GOOD 
WELL PAID JOBS FOR THE CITY WE 
HAVE GENERATED WEALTH FOR THE 
COUNCIL IN A NUMBER OF WAYS HERE 
WE ARE HAVING HAD TO PROVIDE 
PARKING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE IN 
ORDER TO MAKE THE SITE ACCESSIBLE 
AND NOW WE'RE BEING TAX ON THAT 
PROVISION PROVISION BUT DESPITE WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK 
THIS PLAN IS NOW LESS ABOUT 
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE NOT TO DRIVE 
AND MORE ABOUT RAISING MONEY FOR 
THE ALTERNATIVES NOTTINGHAM'S TRAM 
SYSTEM WILL GET TWO NEW BRANCHES 
THE COUNCIL BELIEVES IT WILL 
BENEFIT THE LOCAL ECONOMY 
CONGESTION IS ALREADY COSTING 
BUSINESSES ONE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION YEAR 
THEY NEED TO WEIGH THAT UP AGAINST 
THE COSTS THAT THE WORKPLACE 
PARKING LEVY WILL BE AND THE 
BENEFITS THAT THE WORKPLACE LEVY 
WILL BRING 
THE FINAL DECISION ON 
WHETHER TO INTRODUCE THIS 
CONTROVERSIAL SCHEME IS DOWN TO THE 
GOVERNMENT IT WILL COME LATER THIS 
YEAR YEAR THE GOVERNMENT IS CONSIDERING BIDS 
FROM A DOZEN OR SO CITIES FOR 
RADICAL WAYS OF CUTTING CAR USE 
INCLUDING CHARACTERING PEOPLE TO 
DRIVE AS WELL AS TO PARK THERE ARE 
SOME SIGNS THE GOVERNMENT IS KEENER 
ON THAT APPROACH THAN WHAT 
NOTTINGHAM IS SUGGESTING IT MAY 
WELL WANT TO GIVE THIS EXPERIMENT A 
BIT OF A GO 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TOM 
THE TIME IS ONE EIGHTEEN P. M. OUR TOP STORY 
MORE THAN TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE DEAD 
AFTER YESTERDAY'S EARTHQUAKE IN 
CHINA THE TOLL IS EXPECTED TO RISE 
COMING UP WHY ONLY ONE IN TEN 
PARENTS NOW 
STAYS AT 
HOME FULL TIME 
TO LOOK AFTER THEIR CHILDREN 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON 
THE REMOTE CONTROL C. C. T. V. NOW IN USE 
ON HAMPSTEAD HEATH 
AND THE MAN WHO TAUGHT MICHAEL 
JACKSON TO MOONWALK JEFFREY 
DANIELS OF SHALAMAR SHIMMIES INTO 
THE CAPITAL 
THE RISING COST OF LIVING IS FORCES 
THOUSANDS OF NEW MUMS BACK TO WORK 
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT STAY 
AT HOME AND PAY THE BILLS THAT'S 
ACCORDING TO A NEW SURVEY WHICH 
FOUND ONE IN THREE NEW PARENTS ARE 
CHOOSING WORK OVER STAYING AT HOME 
WITH THEIR BABIES HERE'S ANDREW 
BOMFORD BOMFORD SORRY I'M LATE SCHOOL RUN TRAFFIC 
THE MORNING RUSH ONE OF TWENTY SEVEN MILLION 
PARENTS JUGGLING CHILDCARE AND WORK 
MUM SANDRA RUNS HER OWN MARKETING 
FIRM DAD IAN WORKS FOR A MOBILE 
PHONE OPERATOR THREE YEAR OLD 
LAUREN GOES TO NURSERY NINETY THREE PER CENT OF 
PARENTS GO BACK TO WORK AFTER 
HAVING CHILDREN ACCORDING TO THIS 
NEW RESEARCH JUST TWO MILLION THE 
ROWEST EVER NUMBER STAY AT HOME 
IT SEEMS TO BE AS A PARENT IT'S ALL 
ABOUT GUILT YOU TRY TO DO THE BEST 
FOR YOUR FAMILY AND FOR YOU WHAT 
MAKES YOU ALL HAPPY AS LONG AS YOU 
TRY AND SPEND THAT QUALITY TIME 
DOING THINGS AS FAMILY THAT YOU 
ALL ENJOY 
MANY FEEL THEY HAVE NO 
CHOICE BUT TO RETURN TO WORK MORE 
THAN A THIRD OF PARENTS WITH 
CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWO SAID 
THEY COULD NOT AFFORD TO STAY AT 
HOME THAT NUMBER'S CLIMBING 
STEADILY ALONG WITH THE RISING 
COST OF LIVING 
I FEEL THAT 
SOMETIMES THE CHOICE IS TAKEN AWAY 
FROM US WITH NEED THE TWO INCOMES 
WE DO HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK 
WHETHER I WANTED TO OR NOT I HAD 
TO GO BACK TO WORK L. WOULDN'T SAY 
THERE IS A CHOICE 
IS THERE A COST 
TO CHILDREN IF PARENTS RETURN TO 
WORK THIS RESEARCH FOUND A THIRD 
OF MUMS AND DADS SAID THEIR 
CHILDREN WOULD HAVE A BETTER 
QUALITY OF LIFE IF THEY STAYED AT 
HOME AND SEVEN IN TEN SAID THEY 
WOULD DO THAT IF THEY COULD AFFORD 
TO THE SKHOIS MORE DIFFICULT FOR 
LONE PARENTS WHO ARE BEING 
ENCOURAGED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO GO 
BACK TO WORK AS A ROUTE OUT OF 
POVERTY ON THURSDAY MINISTERS ARE 
EXPECTED TO BACK PROPOSALS 
EXTENDING THE RIGHT OF PARENTS TO 
ASK THEIR EMPLOYERS FOR FLEXIBLE 
WORKING SO THEY CAN JUGGLE WORK AND 
FAMILY LIFE 
IT ENABLES PARENTS TO GO TO WORK 
AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN 
FINANCIALLY SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES 
AND BE THERE FOR THEIR CHILDREN IF 
THEY'RE GROWING UP OR IF THEIR 
CHILDREN GET ILL OR AT TIMES WHEN 
THEIR CHILDREN ARE NOT ABLE TO BE 
AT ATH SCHOOL 
MANY PARENTS CAN'T 
AFFORD THE CHILDCARE A QUARTER OF 
NEW PARENTS CHOOSE TO RAISE THEIR 
CHILDREN AT HOME 
THERE ARE MORE DEVELOPMENTS TODAY 
ON THE SCRAPPING OF THE TEN PENCE 
TAX BAND THE CHANCELLOR OF THE 
EXCHEQUER ALISTAIR DARLING WILL 
MAKE A STATEMENT IN THE COMMONS 
THIS AFTERNOON ON HOW HE INTENDS TO 
COMPENSATE THOSE WHO LOST OUT OUR 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT VICKI 
YOUNG IS IN DOWNING STREET HOW 
FAR IS HE EXPECTED TO GO 
WE ARE 
TOLD OFFICIALLY IT'S HIS LATEST 
THINKING ON HOW HE COMPENSATES 
PEOPLE HE DOES HAVE TO GO FURTHER 
THAN HE HAS GONE BEFORE TO HELP 
APPEASE THOSE BACKBENCHERS THE 
PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S INCREDIBLY 
COMPLICATED TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHO 
HAS LOST OUT AND WORK OUT HOW TO 
COMPENSATE THEM DO YOU MAKE ONE 
OFF PAYMENTS LAST YEAR OR RAISE 
THE MINIMUM WAGE SO THERE IS AN 
ONGOING COMPENSATION PROCESS IT 
WILL BE SIGNIFICANT AND REALLY IT 
HAS TO BE NOT LEAST THERE IS A BY 
ELECTION NEXT WEEK THE CREWE AND 
NANTWICH BY ELECTION LABOUR M. P.'S 
ARE UP THERE CAMPAIGNING AND THEY 
SAY ON THE DOORSTEPS IT'S HITTING 
LABOUR IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION 
THAT LABOUR IS NOT ON THE SIDE OF 
THE POOREST PEOPLE WE ARE TOLD 
THAT THE FULL COMPENSATION PACKAGE 
WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL THE PRE 
BUDGET REPORT IN THE AUTUMN 
THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES IN BURMA 
SAY THEY REMAIN OPPOSED TO ALLOWING 
FOREIGN AID WORKERS TO HELP THE 
VICTIMS OF CYCLONE NARGIS 
GOVERNMENT SOURCES SAY THIRTY TWO THOUSAND 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE 
DISASTER ALTHOUGH AID AGENCIES 
FEAR THE REAL NUMBER MAY BE MUCH 
HIGHER HIGHER THE UN HAS ASKED FOR A SEA OR AIR 
CORRIDOR TO BE ALLOWED TO BRING IN 
AID SUPPLIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
ANOTHER SMALL SIGN THAT BURMA'S AID 
OPERATION MAY BE MOVING UP A GEAR 
STATE TELEVISION SHOWING FOOTAGE OF 
SUPPLIES BEING RUSHED TO THE 
DISASTER ZONE THE AUTHORITIES 
TODAY INSISTING THEY NOW HAVE THE 
SITUATION FIRMLY UNDER CONTROL BUT 
NO ONE ELSE SEEMS TO SHARE THEIR 
CONFIDENCE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
TURVIEFRS ARE STILL LACKING THE 
BASICS HERE FOREIGN AID IS LOADED 
ON BOATS TO TRY TO REACH THE 
FLOODED DELTA REGION BUT THERE ARE 
NOT ENOUGH BOATS OR TRUCKS OR 
HELICOPTERS TO GET THE JOB DONE 
PROPERLY THE AUTHORITIES ARE STILL 
REFUSING TO ALLOW IN FOREIGN 
LOGISTICAL TEAMS TO HELP OUT WE WE ARE NOT REACHING ENOUGH PEOPLE 
QUICKLY ENOUGH WE ARE REACHING 
MAYBE A QUARTER OR MAYBE A FIFTH OF 
THAT SCALE OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO 
SCALE IT UP VERY URGENTLY THOSE THOSE WITH HOUSES STILL STANDING HAVE 
BEGUN TO PATCH UP THE DAMAGE BUT 
THIS DEVASTATED REGION WILL NEED 
OUTSIDE HELP FOR MONTHS OR YEARS TO 
COME THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES DID 
ALLOW AMERICA TO SEND A LITTLE MORE 
AID IN TODAY PERHAPS IT'S THE 
START OF A SLIGHTLY BIGGER AIRLIFT 
BUT A CHORUS OF INTERNATIONAL 
CRITICISM SEEMS TO HAVE MADE LITTLE 
IMPACT IF ANYTHING RESTRICTIONS 
ON FOREIGN ORGANISATIONS INSIDE THE 
COUNTRY ARE TIGHTENING 
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHICH ARE 
ORDINARY PEOPLE IN MYANMAR THAT ARE 
SUFFERING THEREFORE TO HELP THEM 
IS A MUST IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING NOW OF COURSE WE WILL HAVE 
TO USE ALL OF THE MEANS TO HELP 
THOSE PEOPLE 
OUT IN THE DELTA ONE 
OF BURMA'S FEW AVAILABLE 
HELICOPTERS BRINGS IN MORE SUPPLIES 
BUT THE MILITARY SEEM UNWILLING TO 
GRASP THE SCALE OF THIS GROWING 
DISASTER DISASTER A SHIP LOADED WITH DRINKING WATER 
HAS DOCKED IN SPAIN AS PART OF AN 
UNPRECEDENTED EMERGENCY PLAN TO 
ALLEVIATE A DROUGHT THE CITY OF 
BARCELONA IS SUFFERING ITS DRIEST 
SPRING FOR SIXTY YEARS WATER SUPPLIES 
ARE RUNNING LOW THE SHIPMENTS WILL 
CONTINUE UNTIL WORK ON A 
DESALINATION PLANT IS FINISHED 
THE QUEEN AND PRINCE PHILIP ARE 
TRAVELLING TO TURKEY FOR A FOUR DAY 
STATE VISIT THEIR FIRST TO THE 
COUNTRY SINCE NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE TODAY THEY WILL 
VISIT THE TOMB OF MUSTAPHA KEMAL 
ATATURK THE FOUNDER OF MODULAR 
SECULAR TURKEY NICHOLAS WITCHELL 
REPORTS FROM ANKARA 
RARELY IN RECENT YEARS HAS THE 
ROYAL FAMILY BEEN DEPLOYED QUITE SO 
OBVIOUSLY IN SUPPORT OF BRITISH 
FOREIGN POLICY THAN IT HAS IN 
RELATION TO TURKEY THIS WAS LAST 
NOVEMBER WHEN THE PRINCE OF WALES 
PAID HIS SECOND VISIT TO THE 
COUNTRY IN ALMOST AS MANY YEARS 
TURKEY THE NATION WHICH 
GEOGRAPHICALLY LIES AT THE 
INTERSECTION BETWEEN EUROPE AND 
ASIA IS ALSO AT A POLITICAL 
CROSSROADS BETWEEN THOSE WHO SEE 
THEIR FUTURE ALIGNED TO THE WEST 
AND THOSE WHO LOOK TO THEIR 
CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS ROUTES IN 
THE EAST 
FOR MORE THAN EIGHTY YEARS SINCE THE 
MODERN STATE OF TURKEY WAS CREATED 
THIS HAS BEEN A COUNTRY IN WHICH 
POLITICS AND RELIGION HAVE BEEN 
KEPT STRICTLY APART BUT THAT IS 
CHANGING NOW POLITICAL ISLAM IS ON 
THE MARCH 
FOR THE FIRST TIME TURKEY HAS 
ELECTED A PRESIDENT ABDULLAH G. U. L. 
WITH AN ISLAMIST BACKGROUND THAT'S 
ALARMED TURKEY'S STRONG SECULARIST 
MOVEMENT WHICH WANTS RELIGION TO BE 
KEPT OUT OF POLITICS HERE THERE 
HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATION AND VEILED 
THREATS BY THE TURKISH MILITARY 
THAT IT WON'T PERMIT TURKEY TO 
BECOME AN ISLAMIST STATE INTO THIS 
THE FOREIGN OFFICE IS BRINGING THE 
QUEEN SHE WAS LAST HERE THIRTY SEVEN YEARS 
AGO SHE COMES WITH A MESSAGE TO 
UNDERSCORE BRITAIN'S MESSAGE TO 
BRING TURKEY INTO EUROPE 
ONSIDE WITH THE WEST WHICH IS WHAT 
IN STATE VISIT IS ALL ABOUT 
IT'S ONE TWENTY SIX P. M. 
USUALLY THEY FIGHT LIKE CATS AND 
DOGS BUT A GOLDEN RETRIEVER FROM 
CHESHIRE IS PROVING TO BE THE 
EXCEPTION TO THE RULE AS WELL AS 
REARING SIX OF HER OWN PUPPIES 
ECHO THE DOG HAS FOSTERED SIX 
KITTENS IT'S VERY UNUSUAL TO SEE 
FOSTERING BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES 
OF ANIMAL PERHAPS IT'S JUST A 
CASE OF PUPPY LOVE 
I'M SORRY IT WAS NICE 
NOW LET'S HAVE A LOOK TO THE 
WEATHER WITH KIRSTY L. DIDN'T GET 
THE CHANCE TO ENJOY THE SUNSHINE 
YESTERDAY E. CAN I THIS AFTERNOON 
YOU CAN THIS AFTERNOON HOPEFULLY 
MOST OF US SHOULD ENJOY SOME 
SUNSHINE TO COME SUNNY AND 
BREEZIER THIS AFTERNOON THE EAST 
AND NORTH EAST WINDS HAVE PICKED 
AUTOPSY BIT YOU CAN SEE HARDLY 
CLOUD IN THE SKY ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
U. K. THE EXCEPTION YET AGAIN IS THE 
EASTERN SHORES WHICH HAVE BEEN 
PLAGUED BY MIST AND CLOUD 
IN TERMS OF TEMPERATURES THIS 
AFTERNOON THEY'RE JUST A TOUCH 
LOWER THAN YESTERDAY SO STILL 
PRETTY GOOD WELL ABOVE THE 
AVERAGES UP TO AROUND TWENTY FOUR DEGREES 
CELSIUS IN THE SOUTH AND NINETEEN 
DEGREES CELSIUS FURTHER NORTH 
COOLER IN NEWCASTLE WHERE THE 
CLOUD IS MORE STUBBORN 
A SMALL CHANCE OF SHOWER LATER 
THIS AFTERNOON ALONG SOUTHERN 
COUNTIES COUNTIES OVERNIGHT IT SHOULD BE DRY WE 
WILL SEE MORE CLOUD ROLLING IN OFF 
THE NORTH SEA SO CLOUDY AND MISTY 
TOWARDS EASTERN AND CENTRAL PARTS 
OVERNIGHT DRY WITH CLEAR SPELLS AS 
YOU HEAD FURTHER SOUTH AND FOR MOST 
OF US A TOUCH COOLER OVERNIGHT 
THAN IT WAS LAST NIGHT 
NOW THE OUTLOOK FOR TOMORROW 
WE'VE GOT THE LOW CLOUD AROUND IN 
THE MORNING FOR EASTERN AREAS THAT 
SHOULD TEND TO BURN AWAY DURING THE 
DAY FURTHER WEST SUNSHINE FROM 
THE WORD GO SO REALLY IT SHOULD BE 
A CRACKING START TO THE DAY YET 
AGAIN SOMETHING OF BREEZE THOUGH 
STILL AN ISSUE SO A LITTLE BIT
