IN THE LAST DECADES OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY THE NATIONS OF BRITAIN FOUND THEIR VOICES 
LOUD CONFIDENT AND DEFIANT AND THEY WERE RAISED AGAINST ENGLAND 
THE PEOPLE OF SNOWDON ASSERT THAT EVEN IF THEIR PRINCE GAVE OVER LORDSHIPMENT TO THE ENGLISH KING 
THEY WOULD REFUSE TO DO HOMAGE TO ANY FOREIGNER OF WHOSE LANGUAGE CUSTOMS AND LAW THEY WERE IGNORANT 
ON ACCOUNT OF THE ENDLESS PERFIDY OF THE ENGLISH AND TO RECOVER OUR NATIVE FREEDOM 
THE IRISH ARE COMPELLED TO ENTER A DEADLY WAR 
FOR AS LONG AS BUT A HUNDRED OF US REMAIN ALIVE WE WILL YIELD IN NO LEAST WAY TO ENGLISH DOMINION 
WE FIGHT NOT FOR GLORY NOR RICHES NOR HONOUR BUT FOR FREEDOM 
WE KNOW THESE VOICES THEY HAVE BEEN WITH US A LONG TIME NOW 
ALL THE SAME IT IS A SHOCK TO HEAR THEM THIS EARLY 
TO DISCOVER THE POLITICS OF BIRTHPLACE UTTERED WITH SUCH PASSION AND SUCH PAIN 
ONCE SAID THEY COULD NOT BE UNSAID 
WHEN THE WELSH THE SCOTS AND THE IRISH ACTED ON THEIR WORDS 
THE BLOODY WARS OF THE BRITISH NATIONS BECAME INEVITABLE 
AND THESE WOULD NOT JUST BE BATTLES ABOUT TERRITORIES 
THEY WERE BATTLES FOR IDEAS 
IDEAS OF WHAT A SOVEREIGN NATION SHOULD BE 
AN EXTENSION OF THE RULE AS WILL OR SOMETHING WIDER 
SOMETHING INVOLVING THE PEOPLE AS WELL AS THE PRINCE SOMETHING CALLED THE COMMUNITY OF THE REALM 
THOSE BATTLES WOULD BE FOUGHT BETWEEN THE PEOPLES OF BRITAIN WELSHMEN WOULD DIE IN SCOTLAND 
SCOTSMEN WOULD PERISH IN IRELAND THE ENGLISH WOULD KILL AND BE KILLED EVERYWHERE 
FOR THE FIGHT TO THE DEATH BETWEEN PRINCES AND PRINCIPLES 
THE BATTLE FOR THE MAKING OF A NATION WOULD BEGIN IN THE VERY HEART OF ENGLAND 
ONE MAN WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVOKING THE PEOPLES OF BRITAIN INTO AN AWARENESS OF THEIR NATIONHOOD 
AND HE WAS ENGLAND'S OWN HOME GROWN CAESAR EDWARD I 
IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOSE MADE CURIOUS BY HIS FEARSOME REPUTATION OPENED HIS TOMB 
THE MAN THEY FOUND INSIDE WAS EVERY BIT AS AWESOME AS CONTEMPORARIES HAD RECORDED 
DRESSED IN THE PURPLE ROBE OF A ROMAN EMPEROR AN IMPRESSIVE SIX FOOT TWO TALL 
FULLY JUSTIFYING HIS NICKNAME LONG SHANKS 
UPON THAT STARK MARBLE TOMB THE ONLY ORNAMENTATION READS 
EDWARDUS PRIMUS SCOTTORUM MALLEUS HIC EST 
HAMMER OF THE SCOTS 
AFTER A CENTURY OF RULE BY KINGS WHO WERE ESSENTIALLY FRENCHMEN 
EDWARD CAN BE CALLED THE FIRST TRULY ENGLISH KING GIVEN AN OLD ANGLO SAXON NAME 
AND IMBUED WITH A CERTAINTY THAT IT WAS ENGLAND'S IMPERIAL MISSION 
TO TAKE ITS RULE TO THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE BRITISH ISLANDS 
HIS MANY ENEMIES COMPARED HIM TO ONE OF THE BIG CAT PREDATORS 
PERHAPS HE WILL RIGHTLY BE CALLED A LEOPARD 
LEO BRAVE PROUD AND FIERCE THE PARD WILY DEVIOUS AND TREACHEROUS 
THE LEOPARD PRINCE WAS BORN TO SPLENDID IMPOSSIBLE EXPECTATIONS 
HIS FATHER HENRY THE THIRD HAD NAMED HIS SON FOR ENGLAND'S ROYAL SAINT EDWARD THE CONFESSOR 
THE PARAGON SO IT WAS THEN THOUGHT OF KINGLY PERFECTION 
THOUGH THE CONFESSOR HAD BEEN DEAD FOR ALMOST TWO HUNDRED YEARS HENRY ATE DRANK AND WORSHIPPED HIM 
AND FINALLY CREATED FOR THE LONG DEAD KING A SHRINE OF UNPARALLELED MAGNIFICENCE 
OF COURSE SUCH A SHRINE WOULD NEED A HOME THAT EQUALLED ITS SPLENDOUR 
THE NEW WESTMINSTER ABBEY 
HENRY DEMOLISHED THE OLD BASILICA AT WESTMINSTER AND REPLACED IT WITH AN IMMENSE GOTHIC ABBEY 
A BUILDING THAT NOW FITTED HIS VISION OF AN AWE INSPIRING ENGLISH MONARCH 
FROM NOW ON WESTMINSTER WOULD BE THE SYMBOLIC HEART OF THE KINGDOM 
THE PLACE WHERE ALL ENGLISH MONARCHS WOULD BE CROWNED AND BURIED 
HIS FATHER KING HENRY THE THIRD REIGNED FOR FIFTY SIX YEARS 
HE IS NOT REMEMBERED FOR ANY STIRRING ACHIEVEMENT OR BLOOD SOAKED CONQUEST 
BUT HENRY'S TIME ON THE THRONE WAS DRIVEN BY A MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION 
HE WANTED TO TURN THE MONARCHY INTO ENGLAND'S DOMINANT POWER 
HENRY'S GREAT GIFT TO THE NATION WAS MORE THAN JUST A FINE NEW CHURCH 
ACROSS THE WAY ITS SECULAR COUNTERPART 
WAS THE GREAT HALL OF THE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER 
THE PALACE WAS SEAT OF GOVERNMENT AND A RESIDENCE FOR KING HENRY 
ONE LIKE HIS ANGEVIN ANCESTORS DIDN'T MUCH LIKE BEING IN THE SADDLE 
AND THE HALL WAS A COURT IN BOTH THE SENSES THE WORD SUGGESTS 
A PLACE OF JUDGEMENT AND A THEATRE OF CEREMONY 
AT WESTMINSTER THE KING HAD TO BE SEEN TO BE MAGNIFICENT 
BUT THE KING HAD ALSO TO BE SEEN TO BE JUST 
WESTMINSTER MAY HAVE BEEN THE CREATION OF THE MONARCHY 
BUT IT ALSO BELONGED TO ENGLAND A NATION OF LAWS 
THE NATION OF MAGNA CARTA 
HENRY HAD GROWN UP WITH THE CHARTER SIGNED BY HIS FATHER KING JOHN IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
WHICH PUT REAL LIMITS ON THE POWER OF THE KING A BIT OF A BLOW FOR A KING WHO WANTED ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY 
KINGS COULD NO LONGER IGNORE THE COMPLAINTS OF THEIR SUBJECTS 
THAT THEY COULD BE FORCED TO SUBMIT TO A COUNCIL OF THE BARONS 
THAT COUNCIL THOUGHT OF ITSELF AS THE VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY OF THE REALM 
AND EVEN NOW BEGAN TO BE CALLED PARLIAMENT 
ITS ROLE WOULD BE TO HOLD THE KING TO HIS CONTRACT 
SINCE HENRY HAD BECOME KING AS A BOY OF NINE HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO SWALLOW THIS BITTER PILL 
HOWEVER AS HE GREW OLDER HENRY BURNED WITH FRUSTRATION BECOMING DETERMINED TO ESCAPE ITS SHACKLES 
TO RESTORE THE UNCHALLENGED AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN 
KNOWING THAT THIS COULDN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT A FIGHT HENRY ACCEPTED A COMPROMISE POSITION FOR MANY YEARS 
THAT THE KING WAS NOT FREE TO GOVERN THROUGH PURE ROYAL WILL 
BUT HENRY THE THIRD WAS ALSO A PLANTAGENET AND PLANTAGENETS DREAMED DANGEROUS DREAMS 
EXPENSIVE DREAMS OF CAMPAIGNS FAR ABROAD WHICH NO ONE IN YORK OR CANTERBURY COULD SEE THE POINT OF 
AND WHEN PLANTAGENETS THOUGHT THEY MIGHT GET UNWELCOME ADVICE THEY STOPPED LISTENING 
UNTIL THAT IS THEY WERE MADE TO 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT IN THE VERY HALL THAT DEFINED HIS MAJESTY WESTMINSTER 
SEVEN OF THE MOST POWERFUL BARONS CONFRONTED THE KING 
FULLY ARMED THEY PAUSED ONLY TO LEAVE THEIR SWORDS OUTSIDE 
THEY DEMANDED THAT HENRY MEET THEM AT A PARLIAMENT IN OXFORD 
AND STOP TRYING TO TURN HIS EUROPEAN DREAMS INTO REALITY 
THE BARONS WERE LED IN ALL BUT NAME BY THE MOST IMPROBABLE REVOLUTIONARY IN ALL OF BRITISH HISTORY 
SIMON DE MONTFORT HERE AT KENILWORTH 
HE PRESIDED OVER A LITTLE EMPIRE OF CULTURE 
A FRENCH ARISTOCRAT WHO INHERITED THE EARLDOM OF LEICESTER 
SIMON BECAME CONVINCED THAT HE WAS MORE ENGLISH THAN THE ENGLISH 
WHAT WAS GOOD FOR DE MONTFORT WAS GOOD FOR THE NATION LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM EVERYONE KNEW 
THAT SIMON DE MONTFORT WAS A MAN WITH A MISSION 
THAT MISSION EMBARKED ON WITH HIS FELLOW BARONS 
WAS TO BRING THE WAYWARD SELF GLORIFYING MONARCHY TO BOOK 
TO MAKE IT THE SERVANT NOT THE MASTER OF THE REALM 
AT OXFORD AMIDST WILDFIRE RUMOURS A CAMP OF SOLDIERS AND THE GROWLING HUNGER OF A FAMINE 
HENRY THE THIRD WAS TREATED TO THE EMASCULATION OF HIS SOVEREIGNTY 
A DOCUMENT WAS DRAWN UP FOR THE KING TO SIGN NOT DISCUSS JUST ACCEPT 
AND WHAT IT SAID WAS SO STARTLING SO GENUINELY REVOLUTIONARY 
THAT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT OUGHT TO BE ONE OF THOSE DATES ENGRAVED ON THE NATIONAL MEMORY 
THE PROVISIONS OF OXFORD WERE AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT AS MAGNA CARTA 
IN EFFECT THE CROWN HAD BEEN REPLACED BY A NEW COUNCIL OF NOBLES AND CLERGY 
THAT COUNCIL NOW VIRTUALLY RULED ENGLAND FOREIGN COURTIERS WERE MADE TO DISAPPEAR 
IT HAS BEEN ORDAINED THAT THERE ARE TO BE THREE PARLIAMENTS A YEAR TO VIEW THE STATE OF THE KINGDOM 
IT IS PROVIDED THAT FROM EACH COUNTY THERE ARE CHOSEN FOUR LOYAL WORTHY KNIGHTS 
TO HEAR ALL COMPLAINTS FOR THE COMMON BENEFIT OF THE WHOLE KINGDOM 
WHEN THE COMMUNITY OF THE REALM INCLUDING THE KING AND PRINCE EDWARD SWORE TO UPHOLD THE PROVISIONS 
THEY COULD HAVE BEEN IN NO DOUBT ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MOMENT FOR THE FATE OF THE NATION 
AND SO HENRY THE THIRD'S FACADE OF OMNIPOTENT RULE HAD COME CRASHING DOWN AROUND HIS EARS 
BUT HE WAS NOT THE ONLY ROYAL WITH A STAKE IN EVENTS 
HOW DID THE NINETEEN YEAR OLD EDWARD FEEL ABOUT THE DRASTIC SHRINKAGE IN THE POWER OF THE CROWN HIS CROWN 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT FOR SOME TIME EVEN THE PRINCE WAS DAZZLED 
BY THE INTENSE MAGNETISM OF SIMON DE MONTFORT'S PERSONALITY 
AND FOR A WHILE EDWARD WENT ALONG WITH IT 
BUT INEVITABLY DIVISIONS OPENED UP BETWEEN THE REFORMERS 
IT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO MAKE THE KING AND HIS OFFICERS ANSWERABLE TO THE BARONS 
BUT OUGHT THE BARONS TO BE ANSWERABLE TO THEIR INFERIORS 
DE MONTFORT THOUGHT YES THE EARLS THOUGHT NO 
AND AS THOSE DIVISIONS OPENED WIDER 
THE LEOPARD PRINCE BEGAN TO CHANGE HIS SPOTS AND SHARPEN HIS CLAWS 
NOW IT BECAME INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT THE STRUGGLE OVER WHO WAS TO RULE ENGLAND AND HOW THEY WOULD DO IT 
CENTRED ON TWO MEN SIMON AND EDWARD 
NEITHER COULD PREVAIL WITHOUT THE OTHER'S TOTAL DEFEAT 
OVER FIVE YEARS HENRY AND EDWARD MANOEUVRED AGAINST DE MONTFORT FOR POWER UNTIL FINALLY WORDS RAN OUT 
FOR THIS WAS NO THREE MONTH PAPER REVOLUTION LIKE THE ORIGINAL SIGNING OF THE MAGNA CARTA 
THE ISSUE COULD NOW ONLY BE SETTLED ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE NORMAN CONQUEST 
THE POLITICAL FATE OF ENGLAND WAS COMPLETELY FLUID ITS EVENTUAL OUTCOME UNCERTAIN 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR DE MONTFORT WON THE FIRST ROUND AT THE BATTLE OF LEWES ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS 
KING HENRY AND EDWARD WERE BOTH TAKEN PRISONER 
THE YEAR WHICH FOLLOWED WITH DE MONTFORT IN CHARGE 
WAS THE CLOSEST ENGLAND CAME TO A REPUBLIC UNTIL THE DAYS OF OLIVER CROMWELL 
AND IN PARLIAMENT NOT JUST ARISTOCRATS AND BISHOPS BUT ORDINARY KNIGHTS OF THE SHIRE 
AND EVEN BURGESSES FROM THE TOWNS PRESUMED TO DISCUSS THE FATE OF THEIR SUPERIORS A PRINCE AND A KING 
BUT LIKE THE LATER REPUBLIC THIS ONE QUICKLY GAINED THE ATTRIBUTES OF A DICTATORSHIP 
WITH POWER GOING TO HIS HEAD SIMON SEEMED MORE VAINGLORIOUS ADVENTURER THAN MESSIANIC REFORMER 
IN THE END HE SIMPLY REPELLED MORE PEOPLE THAN HE ATTRACTED 
WITH THE IMPOTENT HENRY THE THIRD FIRMLY UNDER LOCK AND KEY 
THE CROWN'S FUTURE LAY WITH EDWARD WHO OUTWITTED HIS CAPTORS 
AND MADE A DASHING HORSEBACK GETAWAY 
EVEN AT THIS STAGE IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT EDWARD 
HE RADIATED THE KIND OF CHARISMA THAT DREW CONFUSED RESPONSES OF BOTH FEAR AND ADORATION 
HE PURPOSELY KEPT HIS SIGNALS MIXED THE BETTER TO CONVERT THEM INTO LOYALTY 
EDWARD LED HIS FOLLOWING TO EVESHAM IN WORCESTERSHIRE 
WHERE DE MONTFORT'S NOW OUTNUMBERED ARMY CAMPED NEAR THE ABBEY 
UNDER STORMY SKIES THE BATTLE WAS A SLAUGHTER 
TOLD HIS SON HAD BEEN KILLED SIMON REPLIED THEN IT IS TIME TO DIE 
HE CHARGED INTO THE FRAY AND WAS SLAIN ON FOOT HIS DEVOTED KNIGHTS FALLING WITH HIM 
EDWARD IGNORED THE RULES OF WAR 
THE WOUNDED WERE STABBED WHERE THEY LAY 
SIMON'S HEAD HANDS FEET AND TESTICLES WERE CUT OFF 
THE GENITALS HUNG AROUND HIS NOSE 
THE CROWN HAD WON BUT ONLY AFTER OVERCOMING KENILWORTH'S MIGHTY DEFENCES 
IN A SIEGE THAT LASTED NINE MONTHS 
BUT EDWARD HAD BEEN GIVEN A SERIOUS EARLY LESSON IN THE POLITICAL REALITIES OF ENGLAND 
HE WOULDN'T CRINGE BEFORE THE BARONS BUT HE HAD TO MAKE THEM HIS ALLIES 
AS PARTNERS THEY'D GO ON TO CREATE AN ENGLISH EMPIRE OF THEIR OWN 
THE REINCARNATION OF ROMAN BRITANNIA 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR EDWARD I.'S CORONATION FINALLY TOOK PLACE 
IN A MAGNIFICENT SANCTUARY CREATED BY HIS FATHER 
THE WESTMINSTER IN WHICH HE WAS CROWNED WOULD 
IF EDWARD HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT BE THE CAPITAL NOT JUST OF ENGLAND BUT OF BRITAIN 
IT WAS IN WALES THAT EDWARD FIRST MADE THE SERIOUSNESS OF HIS AMBITIONS CRYSTAL CLEAR 
HERE THE DOMINANT PRINCE WAS LLEWELYN AP GRUFFYDD 
RULER OF THE MOUNTAINOUS KINGDOM OF GWYNEDD GREATER SNOWDONIA 
KNOWING THAT THE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TERRAIN OF HIS COUNTRY HAD BEEN THE GRAVEYARD OF ENGLISH ARMIES 
LLEWELYN WAS DETERMINED TO RESIST THEIR ATTEMPTS TO SUBDUE CENTRAL WALES 
HERE THE NATIVE WELSH CLUNG ON TO THEIR LANGUAGE CUSTOMS AND LAWS 
LORDS IN THEIR OWN LANDS BUT STILL SUBJECTS OF THE ENGLISH KING 
BY THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY WALES WAS DIVIDED INTO THE PRINCIPALITY OF GWYNEDD 
THE DISPUTED CENTRE AND THE ENCROACHING ENGLISH BARONIAL AND CROWN LANDS 
ENCROACHING THAT IS UNTIL ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT WHEN LLEWELYN WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO HAVE HIMSELF DECLARED 
PRINCEPS WALLIE PRINCE OF WALES 
EXPLOITING THE CIVIL WAR IN ENGLAND AND MAKING AN ALLIANCE WITH DE MONTFORT 
LLEWELYN'S ARMIES OVERRAN THE NOW UNDEFENDED CENTRE 
BUT HE THEN OVERREACHED HIMSELF MARRYING DE MONTFORT'S DAUGHTER 
AN OFFENCE EDWARD WAS UNLIKELY TO FORGIVE OR TO FORGET 
YEARS LATER LLEWELYN HANDED EDWARD THE PERFECT PRETEXT FOR RETRIBUTION 
HE FAILED TO SHOW UP AT EDWARD'S CORONATION 
AND IGNORED A TOTAL OF FIVE SUMMONSES TO PAY HOMAGE TO HIS NEW KING 
EDWARD WHO NEEDED NO TUTORIALS ON THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CEREMONIES AND POWER IMMEDIATELY TOOK THIS 
AS A SLAP IN THE FACE AN ACT OF VIRTUAL REBELLION 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX A HUGE ARMY THE BIGGEST IN BRITAIN SINCE THE NORMAN CONQUEST 
INVADED GWYNEDD PENETRATING RIGHT TO ITS FURTHEST CORNERS TO SNOWDONIA AND TO ANGLESEY 
FACED WITH THIS INVASION LLEWELYN WAS FORCED TO SURRENDER 
BUT AS SO OFTEN IN THESE YEARS HUMILIATION BRED DEFIANCE 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THE WELSH LAUNCHED A SURPRISE ATTACK ON AN ENGLISH GARRISON 
EDWARD NOW BORE DOWN AGAIN WITH AN EVEN BIGGER ARMY 
BUT THIS CAMPAIGN WAS FAR FROM BEING A WALKOVER 
REALISING THIS THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY ATTEMPTED TO CONCILIATE BETWEEN THE WARRING FACTIONS 
OFFERING LLEWELYN LAND AND TITLE IN ENGLAND IF HE WOULD RENOUNCE HIS RIGHTS IN WALES 
AND THE ANSWER TO THIS OFFER WAS BLUNT 
THAT THEY MUST STAND BY THEIR LAWS AND RIGHTS IN DEFENCE OF ALL WALES 
THE PEOPLE PREFERRED TO DIE RATHER THAN TO LIVE UNDER ENGLISH RULE 
THEY WOULD NOT DO HOMAGE TO ANY STRANGER OF WHOSE LANGUAGE MANNERS AND LAWS THEY WERE IGNORANT 
THEY WOULD FIGHT IN DEFENCE OF NOSTRA NATIO OUR NATION AGAINST THE ENGLISH 
WHEN THE WAR WAS RENEWED 
IT WAS WITH FRESH AND UNSPARING SAVAGERY 
NO QUARTER WAS GIVEN BY EITHER SIDE 
THE WELSH EXPLOITED THEIR LAND AMBUSHED THE SLOW MOVING COMPANIES OF KNIGHTS 
AND THEN DISAPPEARED OFF AGAIN INTO THE HILLS AND FORESTS 
THEN IN A MINOR SKIRMISH IN CENTRAL WALES LLEWELYN WAS KILLED BY AN ANONYMOUS ENGLISH SPEARMAN 
THE FINAL ANNIHILATION OF RESISTANCE TOOK ANOTHER SIX MONTHS 
BEFORE THE KING COULD CLAIM WALES TO BE PACIFIED 
HOWEVER THE SUBJUGATION OF WALES WAS FAR MORE SUBTLE THAN THE SURGICAL APPLICATION OF BRUTE FORCE 
EDWARD HAD THE CHILLING UNCANNILY MODERN KNOWLEDGE 
THAT TO BREAK YOUR ENEMY YOU MUST FIRST STRIP HIM OF HIS CULTURAL IDENTITY 
BEFORE THIS PLACE WAS CALLED CONWAY BY THE ENGLISH IT WAS ABERCONWY 
IT WAS A MONASTERY HOUSING THE TOMB OF THE MOST POWERFUL OF ALL WELSH PRINCES AND HOME TO A SACRED RELIC 
THAT THE WELSH BELIEVED TO BE A PIECE OF THE TRUE CROSS 
NATURALLY THEN THE MONASTERY BECAME A FORTRESS 
AND THE CROSS WAS TAKEN TO LONDON ALONG WITH LLEWELYN'S CROWN 
THE LORDS CALLED THEMSELVES PRINCES OF WALES FINE 
FROM ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED ONE THEY WILL BE THE MOST ENGLISH OF THE ENGLISH 
THE FIRST SON OF THE KING THE HEIR TO THE THRONE THE EMPEROR IN WAITING 
BUT THE MOST TITANIC OF ALL THE VISIBLE SIGNS OF THE ENGLISH EMPIRE WERE ITS CASTLES 
A GRANITE RING OF FORTRESSES STRETCHING FROM BUILTH TO HOPE 
MOST SUPPLIED FROM THE SEA DEPRIVING THE WELSH OF ANY HOPE OF LIBERATION 
FOR THE WELSH OF SNOWDONIA THE GREAT STONE FORTRESSES IN THEIR MIDST WERE WHAT ONE OF THEM CALLED 
THE MAGNIFICENT BADGES OF OUR SUBJECTION 
THE SYMBOL NOT OF IMPERIAL GRANDEUR BUT OF CRUSHING NATIONAL ANNIHILATION 
A PERMANENT DAILY WOUNDING REMINDER OF CONQUEST AND HUMILIATION 
THE MOST COLOSSAL EXERCISE IN FACT IN COLONIAL DOMINATION ANYWHERE IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE 
BENEATH THE LION STANDARD OF EDWARD PLANTAGENET THE WELSH INHABITANTS 
HAD NOW BECOME SECOND CLASS CITIZENS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY 
THOSE NATIVES WERE TREATED FOR THE MOST PART LIKE NAUGHTY CHILDREN 
NOT ALLOWED TO BEAR ARMS OF COURSE BUT EVEN FORCED TO ASK PERMISSION 
IF THEY WANTED STRANGERS TO STAY AT THEIR HOUSE OVERNIGHT 
WORST OF ALL I THINK THE WELSH WERE DOOMED BY ENGLISH SUPERIORITY 
TO BECOME OBJECTS OF TERMINAL QUAINTNESS 
THE QUAINT LANGUAGE QUAINT SONGS THOSE AMUSING CHOIRS AND CHANTS 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE AND FOR THE JEWS OF ENGLAND IT WAS 
THE WELSH WARS COST TEN TIMES THE KING'S ANNUAL REVENUE 
AND THE PRICE OF VICTORY AND CASTLE BUILDING HAD SO BLED THE JEWS THE USUAL SOURCE OF LOANS AND TAXATION 
THAT THEY HAD NOTHING LEFT TO YIELD AND SO COULD BE DISPENSED WITH ALTOGETHER 
EARLY IN HIS REIGN EDWARD PERHAPS ACTING FROM RELIGIOUS CONVICTION OUTLAWED MONEYLENDING 
AND SO PUT MOST OF ENGLAND'S JEWS OUT OF BUSINESS 
HE THEN FORCED THEM TO WEAR YELLOW FELT BADGES OF IDENTIFICATION 
AND SO BE RECOGNISED AS THE SUBSPECIES OF HUMANITY HE UNDOUBTEDLY BELIEVED THEY WERE 
A YEAR AFTER HIS FIRST WELSH INVASION 
EDWARD ARRESTED ALL THE HEADS OF THE JEWISH HOUSEHOLDS 
AND HANGED NEARLY THREE HUNDRED IN THE TOWER 
NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS HE EXPELLED THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY 
PERHAPS THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY 
AN ACT SO OVERWHELMINGLY POPULAR ESPECIALLY WITH THE CHURCH 
THAT IT AWARDED HIM A HUGE TAX GRANT 
SO IT'S EDWARD'S ENGLAND 
WHICH BECAME THE FIRST COUNTRY TO PERFORM A LITTLE ACT OF ETHNIC CLEANSING ON ITS JEWS 
THE VIOLENT UPROOTING OF ENTIRE COMMUNITIES IN YORK LINCOLN AND LONDON 
IT WAS NOT PLAIN SAILING FOR THE JEWS ABOARD ONE DEPORTATION BOAT IN THE THAMES 
AT QUEENBOROUGH THE CAPTAIN ENCOURAGED HIS JEWISH PASSENGERS TO STRETCH THEIR LEGS 
AS THE SHIP BEACHED ON THE RECEDING TIDE AS IT RETURNED HE BARRED THEM FROM GETTING BACK ABOARD 
CHALLENGING THEM TO CALL ON THEIR GOD TO PART THE WAVES AS HE HAD WITH THE RED SEA 
BUT THERE WAS NO MIRACLE THIS TIME THEY ALL DROWNED 
IN LINCOLN CATHEDRAL LIE THE ENTRAILS OF ELEANOR OF CASTILE QUEEN TO EDWARD I 
SHE DIED WITHIN MONTHS OF THE EXPULSIONS LEAVING HER HUSBAND 
NORMALLY SO THICK SKINNED AND EMOTIONALLY COARSE DISTRAUGHT PLUNGED INTO GRIEF 
EDWARD'S DEVOTION IS BEST REFLECTED IN THE MONUMENT UNIQUE IN MEDIEVAL KINGSHIP 
TWELVE CROSSES HE BUILT TO MARK THE POINTS WHERE ELEANOR'S BODY LAY EN ROUTE TO WESTMINSTER ABBEY 
THE MOST FAMOUS BEING CHARING CROSS IN LONDON 
ELEANOR'S DEATH SEEMED TO TRANSFER EDWARD'S RESERVE OF PASSION TO WHAT NOW BECAME THE REAL LOVE OF HIS LIFE 
THE SINGLE MINDED PURSUIT OF IMPERIAL POWER 
IT WAS SCOTLAND THAT WAS DESTINED TO BE ON THE RECEIVING END OF EDWARD'S DEADLY POWER GAMES 
WHICH BEGAN AS ALWAYS BY CONVERTING ACCIDENTS INTO OPPORTUNITIES 
THE ACCIDENT WAS THE DEATH IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY OF THE LAST SURVIVING DIRECT HEIR TO ALEXANDER THE THIRD 
KING OF SCOTLAND 
WITH HER GONE THE SCOTTISH NOBLES WERE LINING UP FOR THE THRONE 
SOMEONE WAS NEEDED TO JUDGE THE CONTESTANTS WELL GUESS WHO 
THE STRONGEST CLAIMANTS LED THE TWO MOST POWERFUL FAMILY FACTIONS IN SCOTLAND 
THE BRUCES AND THE COMYN BALLIOL ALLIANCE THEY HATED EACH OTHER 
BOTH WERE DETERMINED TO HAVE THEIR MAN MADE KING AND AS THEY PUSHED THEIR RIVAL CLAIMS FULLY 
THEIR CONFLICT WOULD CAUSE CIVIL WAR ACROSS ALL OF SCOTLAND 
EDWARD CAME NORTH TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE TWO RIVALS WOULD BE KING 
THE COMPETITORS MET HIM ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RIVER TWEED NEAR A PLACE CALLED NORHAM 
OF COURSE EDWARD BEING EDWARD HE HAD A PRICE ON HIS MIND 
IN RETURN FOR BEING ADJUDICATOR SLASH GODFATHER TO THE SCOTS 
AND THAT PRICE NEEDLESS TO SAY WAS HOMAGE THE BENT KNEE THE KISS ON THE RING OF THE DEVOTED SWORD 
THE ACCEPTANCE BY WHOEVER GOT THE JOB THAT HENCEFORTH HE WOULD BE EDWARD'S MAN 
DEEPLY IN HIS DEBT HIS SOLDIERS AT THE KING'S COMMAND 
TO PROVE HIS POINT HE GATHERED AN ARMY AT NORHAM AN ARMY OF MONKS SCHOLARS AND ANTIQUARIANS 
THEIR HEAVY ARTILLERY WERE ANCIENT CHARTERS AND CHRONICLES 
THEIR JOB TO FIND THE HISTORICAL PROOF OF ENGLISH OVERLORDSHIP 
BUT THEY FAILED SO THE KING THREW THE PROBLEM RIGHT BACK TO THE SCOTS 
EDWARD ASKED THE GUARDIANS OF THE REALM TO FIND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE WHY HE WAS NOT THEIR FEUDAL OVERLORD 
TO WHICH HE GOT A WONDERFULLY CANNY CONTRADICTION NOT AT ALL WHAT HE WANTED TO HEAR 
SIRE THEY SAID THE BONA GENTES THE RESPONSIBLE MEN WHO HAVE SENT US HERE KNOW FULL WELL 
YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY MAKE SO GREAT A CLAIM UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVED YOU HAD A RIGHT TO IT 
BUT OF THIS RIGHT WE KNOW NOTHING 
WHICH IS LIKE SAYING YOU CAN'T BE COMPLETELY OFF YOUR HEAD TO COME UP WITH THIS SOVEREIGNTY STUFF 
BUT ACTUALLY IT IS ALL NEWS TO US CHUM SINCE THE SCOTTISH REALM ON THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER 
IS HELD TRIBUTE TO NO ONE BUT GOD WE DON'T HAVE TO PROVE A THING 
IT'S FOR YOU TO COME UP WITH THE SUPER MONK WITH THE PERFECT CHARTER LET US KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE IT 
IN THE END ALL THOSE WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE STILL IN WITH A CHANCE OF WINNING THE SCOTS THRONE 
PAID HOMAGE TO EDWARD BUT THE REST OF THE SCOTS COMMUNITY OF THE REALM HELD THEIR NOSES AND STOOD ALOOF 
WAS THIS AS SOME SCOTTISH HISTORIANS HAVE ALWAYS INSISTED AN EDWARDIAN TRAP 
WAS HE ALREADY THINKING OF TURNING SCOTLAND INTO WALES NORTH 
THE NEXT TERRITORY TO BE GOBBLED UP BY HIS IMPERIAL APPETITE 
WELL I THINK THE APPETITE GREW WITH THE EATING 
A YEAR LATER WHEN THE FINAL VERDICT CAME THROUGH 
BALLIOL DID PROVE TO HAVE THE BETTER CLAIM AND WAS THE CLEAR CHOICE OF SCOTLAND 
EDWARD DID NOT FORCE HIM ON ANYBODY 
FOR HIS PART ONCE BALLIOL HAD ACKNOWLEDGED EDWARD'S OVERLORDSHIP 
THE ENGLISH KING AGREED TO KEEP THE SEPARATE IDENTITY OF SCOTTISH INSTITUTIONS 
ONLY IF THEIR INTEREST CROSSED WOULD THERE BE TROUBLE 
ALAS THEY DID AND TROUBLE THERE CERTAINLY WAS 
EDWARD WASTED NO TIME IN HUMILIATING BALLIOL ON EVERY OCCASION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS 
DRIVING THE SCOTS COMMUNITY OF THE REALM THE NOBLES CLERGY GENTRY AND BURGESSES 
TO STAND AGAINST THEIR OWN KING 
WHEN WAR WITH FRANCE COINCIDED WITH ANOTHER WELSH REBELLION 
EDWARD EXERCISED HIS OVERLORDSHIP OF SCOTLAND AND SUMMONED THEIR NOBILITY TO FIGHT FOR HIM 
THEY REFUSED AND THEN WENT ONE STAGE FURTHER 
THEY SIGNED A FORMAL TREATY WITH FRANCE AGAINST ENGLAND 
TO EDWARD IT WAS SELF EVIDENTLY A DECLARATION OF WAR 
THE ARMY HE RAISED IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX PUT EVEN THE WELSH CAMPAIGN IN THE SHADE 
FIRST TO FALL WAS SCOTLAND'S WEALTHIEST CITY PORT BERWICK UPON TWEED 
THE SIEGE LASTED ONLY HOURS THE MASSACRE THAT FOLLOWED DAYS 
THE KING OF ENGLAND SPARED NO ONE 
WHATEVER THE AGE OR SEX 
AND FOR TWO DAYS STREAMS OF BLOOD FLOWED FROM THE BODIES OF THE SLAIN 
SO THAT MILLS COULD BE TURNED ROUND BY ITS FLOW 
AT DUNBAR THE SCOTS ROYAL ARMY WERE SWEPT ASIDE 
NOW EDWARD TURNED IMPERIAL CONQUEROR IN DEADLY EARNEST 
KING JOHN BALLIOL'S ARMS WERE TORN FROM HIS COAT LIKE A COURT MARTIALLED SUBALTERN 
ENGLISH OFFICIALS TOOK OVER SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT 
AND JUST AS HE'D RIPPED THE HEART FROM THE WELSH SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE BY CARRYING OFF THEIR SACRED RELICS 
EDWARD NOW TOOK THE STONE OF SCONE SYMBOL OF THE INDEPENDENT SCOTTISH CROWN TO WESTMINSTER 
WHERE A MAGNIFICENT CORONATION CHAIR WAS CUSTOM DESIGNED TO HOLD IT 
AND WHEN EDWARD WAS GIVEN THE BROKEN SCOTTISH ROYAL SEAL HE SET IT ASIDE COMMENTING 
A MAN DOES GOOD BUSINESS WHEN HE RIDS HIMSELF OF A TURD 
ONE BY ONE A HOST OF SCOTS CAME TO DO HOMAGE TO EDWARD 
INCLUDING THE BRUCES BUT THERE WAS ONE WHO DID NOT 
MALCOLM WALLACE AND THIS MALCOLM HAD A BROTHER 
HERE HE IS THE STANDARD ISSUE FREEDOM FIGHTER OF THE IMAGINATION 
THE GIVE 'EM HELL WHISKERS THE SAVE ME JESUS EYES 
THE HAMSTRINGS FROM HELL 
WE HAVEN'T A CLUE OF COURSE WHETHER WILLIAM WALLACE LOOKED LIKE THIS 
ANY MORE THAN WE KNOW IF HE COULD HAVE BEEN A STUNTMAN FOR MEL GIBSON WHO IMMORTALISED HIM IN BRAVEHEART 
BUT WALLACE IS ONE OF THOSE LARGER THAN LIFE FIGURES WHOSE EPIC ROMANCE REFUSES TO GO AWAY 
IT JUST GROWS TO MATCH THIS EXTRAORDINARY MONUMENT TO HIM DOMINATING THE STIRLING SKYLINE 
THERE IS NO DOUBT OF COURSE THAT WALLACE DID COUNT 
HIS BRIEF DRAMATIC INTERVENTION IN THE WARS BETWEEN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND DID CHANGE BRITISH HISTORY 
IF ONLY TO SHOW THAT THE ARMIES OF EDWARD I WERE NOT INVINCIBLE 
AT ALL TIMES AND IN ALL PLACES 
BEYOND THAT WALLACE WAS ONE OF THE FEW SCOTS WHO NEVER AT ANY STAGE 
PAID HOMAGE TO EDWARD REMAINING LOYAL TO KING JOHN BALLIOL 
MORE GENTLEMAN TURNED OUTLAW THAN PEASANT MAN OF THE GLENS 
WALLACE WASN'T A ONE MAN WAR EITHER 
BY MID ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN ALL SCOTLAND WAS ON THE BOIL 
NORTH OF THE FORTH ANDREW MURRAY MATCHED OR SURPASSED HIM BY LEADING A WILD AND BRILLIANT GUERRILLA WAR 
WHEN MURRAY MARCHED SOUTH AND WALLACE MOVED NORTH 
TO MEET HERE ON THE FORTH AT STIRLING THE KEY TO SCOTLAND 
THE CHAOTIC WILDFIRE UPRISING TURNED INTO A MAJOR MILITARY CAMPAIGN 
ON THE EVE OF THE BATTLE OF STIRLING BRIDGE WALLACE TOLD THE ENGLISH WE ARE NOT HERE TO MAKE PEACE 
BUT TO DO BATTLE AND TO LIBERATE OUR KINGDOM 
THE SCOTS GATHERED ON THE ABBEY CRAIG RIDGE 
BELOW A NARROW WOODEN BRIDGE LED TO THE CASTLE AND TO THE ENGLISH 
WALLACE ALLOWED HALF OF THEM TO CROSS THE FRAGILE STRUCTURE ENOUGH FOR HIS FORCES TO DEAL WITH 
AND SO THEY DID RUSHING DOWN FROM THEIR PERCH THROUGH THE WOODS AND INTO THE ENGLISH RANKS 
WALLACE ON FOOT WITH A GREAT SHARP SWORD GOES AMONGST THE VERY THICKEST OF HIS FOES 
THE SCOTS VANQUISHED THE SAVAGE ENGLISH WHOM THEY PUT INTO MOURNING FOR DEATH 
SOME HAD THEIR THROATS CUT BY SWORDS OTHERS WERE TAKEN PRISONERS OTHERS DROWNED 
ONE THE HATED ENGLISH TAXMAN CRESSINGHAM WAS SKINNED 
HIS FAT BODY MADE INTO A BELT FOR WALLACE'S VICTORIOUS SWORD 
AND YET AS SO OFTEN IN SCOTTISH HISTORY DEFEAT QUICKLY FOLLOWED VICTORY DOWN THE FORTH AT FALKIRK 
WALLACE'S WARRIORS DIED BY THE THOUSAND 
THEY FELL LIKE BLOSSOMS IN AN ORCHARD WHEN THE FRUIT HAS RIPENED 
BODIES COVERED THE GROUND AS THICKLY AS SNOW IN WINTER 
WALLACE HIMSELF MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE SLAUGHTER 
ONLY TO BE CAPTURED YEARS LATER 
BETRAYED BY A SCOTSMAN POSSIBLY EVEN THE BRUCE HIMSELF 
AFTER A MOCK TRIAL WALLACE ENDURED THE MOST APPALLING DEATH THAT THE KING'S RAGE COULD DEVISE 
A LIVE DISEMBOWELMENT 
IN THE INTERVENING SIX YEARS SCOTLAND SUFFERED ALMOST AS BADLY BY EDWARD'S HAND 
AS THE SCOTS DREW INSPIRATION FROM WALLACE AND FOUGHT ON 
EDWARD CAME BACK FROM ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN TO ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FOUR 
THE WAR BECAME A MURDEROUS ACADEMY OF SIEGE WARFARE 
EDWARD CAME FROM THE SOUTH WEST TO CAERLAVEROCK CASTLE 
TOOK IT AND LEFT WITH ITS DEFENDERS HANGED FROM THE WALLS 
NORTH TO BOTHWELL WHERE A HUGE SIEGE TOWER OVERCAME ITS MIGHTY BATTLEMENTS AND ON AND ON 
NOT EVEN SCOTLAND'S WESTMINSTER WAS SAVED FROM HIS FURY 
DUNFERMLINE ABBEY IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES WHERE YOU CAN ALMOST SMELL TRAGEDY IN THE STONEWORK 
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE WAS BUILT OR RATHER REBUILT AFTER ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THREE 
IN THAT YEAR EDWARD I IN ONE OF HIS MURDEROUSLY VINDICTIVE TANTRUMS 
TORCHED THE PLACE BURNT IT TO THE GROUND 
HE WAS AS USUAL MAKING A POINT 
TO SMASH UP A ROYAL MAUSOLEUM WAS TO STRIKE DIRECTLY AT SCOTLAND'S SENSE OF INDEPENDENT HISTORY 
THE GREATEST SYMBOL OF THAT INDEPENDENCE AS ALWAYS WAS STIRLING 
ITS SURRENDER TOOK THE FIGHT OUT OF THE SCOTS 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FOUR THEY SUBMITTED TO EDWARD 
WELL HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT THAT WAS THAT DONE WITH PEACE 
A MISTAKE 
FOR WHAT EDWARD COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE PREDICTED WAS THE EMERGENCE OF A SCOTTISH LION 
EVEN MORE RUTHLESS THAN THE LEOPARD HIMSELF 
AND HE WAS OF COURSE THE BRUCE 
STRANGELY WHEN YOU CATALOGUE THE STRENGTHS OF ROBERT THE BRUCE 
HIS POLITICAL CUNNING HIS MILITARY INGENUITY HIS STEELY RESOLUTION EVEN HIS INTERMITTENT FITS OF RAGE 
THEY ALL BEGIN TO SOUND RATHER LIKE THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE MAN WHOSE WORK HE HAD SWORN TO UNDO EDWARD I 
IF HE HAD READ THE BOOK OF EDWARD'S LIFE HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT LESSON ONE WAS NOT BEAT THE FOREIGNER 
IT WAS FIRST WIN YOUR BATTLES AT HOME 
AND SO IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIX 
BRUCE THE MOST POLITICALLY INTELLIGENT AND MILITARILY SUCCESSFUL FIGURE IN MEDIEVAL SCOTTISH HISTORY 
DID JUST THAT 
HE MET WITH JOHN COMYN HIS MAIN RIVAL AND ENDED UP 
STABBING HIM BEFORE THE ALTER OF GREYFRIARS CHURCH IN DUMFRIES 
THE MURDER IS NEITHER EXPLAINED NOR JUSTIFIED BY IT BEING THE CASE OF A PATRIOT KNOCKING OFF A QUISLING 
FOR COMYN HAD BEEN A LOT MORE CONSISTENT IN HIS OPPOSITION TO THE ENGLISH THAN BRUCE 
HE REMAINED LOYAL TO KING BALLIOL WHO STILL LIVED AND SO HAD TO BE REMOVED 
BARELY SIX WEEKS AFTER HE HAD MURDERED COMYN BRUCE HAD HIMSELF INAUGURATED KING AT SCONE 
INSTEAD OF UNIFYING THE SCOTS BEHIND A SINGLE LEADER 
BRUCE'S ACTIONS ONLY INTENSIFIED WHAT WAS ALREADY A SCOTTISH CIVIL WAR 
ONE THAT HE INITIALLY LOST 
HE FLED SCOTLAND AND SO CREATED A VACUUM OF KNOWLEDGE FILLED BY HEROIC MYTHOLOGY 
THE FABLE OF THE CAVE AND THE SPIDER WHOSE PATIENCE GAVE ROBERT THE RESOLUTION TO PERSEVERE 
THERE WAS NO CAVE NO SPIDER BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING MUCH MORE EXTRAORDINARY 
THE POLISHED NOBLE TURNING HIMSELF INTO A GUERRILLA CAPTAIN 
FOR ROBERT THE BRUCE NOT WALLACE WROTE THE BOOK ON PARTISAN WARFARE 
ON HIS RETURN FOUR MONTHS LATER ADVERSITY NOW MADE HIM A GREAT GENERAL 
ATTACKING HIS SCOTS AND ENGLISH FOES ALIKE 
IN THE END ROBERT THE BRUCE SIMPLY OUTLIVED THE OLD KING WHO BREATHED HIS LAST FEARING THE WORST 
SHOULD EVER HIS SON EDWARD OF CAERNARVON HAVE TO MEET ROBERT THE BRUCE ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE 
EVENTUALLY EDWARD DIED 
HERE NEAR CARLISLE IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVEN 
EN ROUTE TO DEAL WITH BRUCE HIMSELF 
IRONICALLY AT THE END OF HIS LIFE 
EDWARD TURNED THOUGHTFUL EVEN WRITING THAT HE WANTED TO PROMOTE 
PLEASANTNESS EASE AND QUIET FOR OUR SUBJECTS 
WELL IF HE REALLY BELIEVED THIS HE MUST HAVE DIED A TRULY DISAPPOINTED MAN 
A STORY SAYS THE KING ORDERED HIS BONES TO BE BOILED FROM HIS FLESH AND CARRIED BEFORE HIS SON'S ARMY 
BELIEVING THAT AS LONG AS HIS BONES MARCHED NORTH THE SCOTS WOULD NEVER BE VICTORIOUS 
BUT EDWARD JUNIOR WAS GOING TO NEED MORE THAN HIS FATHER'S SHINBONE IF HE WAS TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF SUCCESS 
HE WAS CERTAINLY NOT THE INCARNATION OF THE COMMUNITY OF THE REALM 
NEITHER WAS HE THE TRUE HEIR OF THE CAESAR OF BRITAIN THE MONARCH OF ALL HE SURVEYED 
HE WAS JUST A LOSER 
BRUCE ON THE OTHER HAND WAS STILL A WINNER OVER SEVEN YEARS HE REGAINED HIS KINGDOM 
SO BY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FOURTEEN THE ENGLISH ONLY CONTROLLED BOTHWELL BERWICK JEDBURGH 
AND THE KEY STIRLING CASTLE NOW BESIEGED BY THE SCOTS 
FACED WITH COMPLETE HUMILIATION IN SCOTLAND EDWARD THE SECOND FINALLY ACTED AND MARCHED NORTH 
HE MET HIS NEMESIS IN A MUDDY FIELD ALONG THE BANKS OF THE BANNOCK BURN 
IT WAS NOT TO BE THE USUAL STORY OF CHARGE ARROWS AWAY SLASH VICTORY 
BUT A RELENTLESS TWO DAY AFFAIR 
OUTNUMBERED THREE TO ONE BRUCE DID GET TO CHOOSE THE BOGGY BATTLEFIELD 
KNOWING THAT EVEN PLANTAGENET WAR MACHINES DON'T WORK WELL ON WET GROUND 
HOWEVER IT WAS ALMOST ALL OVER BEFORE IT HAD BEGUN 
YOUNG ENGLISH KNIGHT HENRY DE BOHUN CAUGHT BRUCE UNAWARES AND UNARMOURED 
ON HIS LITTLE MOUNT SOME WAY OFF FROM HIS SOLDIERS 
SO HENRY MISSED THE NOBLE KING AND HE STANDING IN HIS STIRRUPS WITH AN AXE THAT WAS BOTH HARD AND GOOD 
STRUCK HIM A BLOW WITH SUCH GREAT FORCE THAT IT CLEAVED THE HEAD TO HIS BRAINS 
THE SHAFT OF THE AXE LEFT BROKEN IN ROBERT'S FIST 
SKIRMISHING FOLLOWED AS THE SHORT JUNE NIGHT FELL BRUCE REMINDING THE SCOTS 
THE ENGLISH ARE BENT ON OBLITERATING MY KINGDOM NAY OUR WHOLE NATION 
THE ENGLISH KNIGHTS CHARGE 
THE SODDEN GROUND AND SCHILTROM 
HEDGEHOGS OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEN EACH HOLDING A TWELVE FOOT SPEAR DEFEAT THEM 
RANKS OF INFANTRY MEET HEAD ON 
SUCH A SMASHING OF SPEARS THAT MEN COULD HEAR IT FAR AWAY 
ENGLISH ARCHERS ARE NOW SWEPT AWAY BY SCOTS CAVALRY 
OR BLOCKED BY THE FOUR SCHILTROMS WHICH UNITE AND PUSH FORWARD 
MANY A SPLENDID MIGHTY BLOW DEALT THERE ON BOTH SIDES 
UNTIL BLOOD BURST THROUGH THE MAIL COATS AND WENT STREAMING DOWN TO THE EARTH 
EDWARD THE SECOND FLED THE FIELD WITH FIVE HUNDRED KNIGHTS 
THE ENGLISH FORCE BROKE BEHIND HIM AND WAS SLAUGHTERED THE BURN BECOMES SO CHOKED 
MEN COULD PASS DRY FOOT OVER IT ON DROWNED HORSES AND MEN 
EDWARD THE SECOND LEFT HIS SHIELD HIS SEAL HIS HONOUR 
AND PERHAPS FOUR THOUSAND ENGLISH AND WELSH DEAD 
HAVING WON THE VICTORY ON THE BATTLEFIELD IF NOT THE WAR ITSELF 
THE SCOTS NOW SOUGHT INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION OF THEIR NEWLY WON LIBERTY 
THE OCCASION WAS A LETTER SENT TO THE POPE 
GIVING REASONS WHY SCOTLAND'S INDEPENDENCE OUGHT TO BE RECOGNISED BY THE CHURCH AS ITSELF SACRED 
THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN HERE IN ARBROATH ABBEY 
AND MORE THAN ANYTHING EVER PRODUCED SOUTH OF THE BORDER 
REPRESENTED A PERFECT FUSION BETWEEN THE TWO IDEAS OF SOVEREIGNTY WE HAVE SEEN IN ACTION 
THE NATION AND THE PRINCE 
AT THE HEART OF WHAT WE CALL THE DECLARATION OF ARBROATH IS SOMETHING MUCH MORE POWERFUL AND DEEPLY MOVING 
IT IS THE INSISTENCE THAT THE NATION LIVED ON BEYOND AND OUTSIDE THE PERSON OF THE PRINCE 
WHO FOR A TIME HAPPENED TO CLAIM ITS GOVERNMENT 
WE HEARD SOMETHING LIKE THIS EARLIER AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF OUR STORY IN OXFORD IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT 
BUT HERE IN SCOTLAND IT IS MUCH MORE ELOQUENT 
THE IMAGE OF THE FREE PATRIOT DRAWN NOT AS A DESPERADO LIKE WALLACE OR A MIGHTY PRINCE LIKE BRUCE 
BUT AS ONE OF A BAND OF BROTHER SURVIVORS 
FOR AS LONG AS BUT A HUNDRED OF US REMAIN ALIVE WE WILL YIELD IN NO LEAST WAY TO ENGLISH DOMINION 
WE FIGHT NOT FOR GLORY NOR RICHES NOR HONOUR BUT FOR FREEDOM 
WHICH NO GOOD MAN GIVES UP EXCEPT WITH HIS LIFE 
THE REAL LESSON OF THE BATTLE OF BANNOCKBURN WAS THAT THE SCOTTISH KING COMMANDED LOYALTY 
IN WAYS THAT JUST NEVER OCCURRED TO EDWARD THE SECOND 
ROBERT THE BRUCE KNEW THAT HE COULD ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL IF HE COULD BE THE PERSONIFICATION OF SCOTLAND 
THE INCARNATION OF THE COMMUNITY OF THE REALM 
THAT'S WHY HE WAS NOT SCOTLAND'S EDWARD I HE WAS SCOTLAND'S SIMON DE MONTFORT 
LIKE DE MONTFORT BRUCE HAD PINNED HIS PERSONAL CAUSE TO THE FLAG AND TO THE PASSIONS OF HIS COUNTRY 
UNLIKE EDWARD I ROBERT WAS NOT JUST A WARLORD WHO HAMMERED THE COUNTRY TO HIS WILL 
HE HAD MANAGED TO FORGE A TRUE ALLIANCE WITH THE PEOPLE 
A COMMUNITY OF THE REALM THAT WHEN UNITED AND LED BY KING ROBERT I COULD WIN ITS FREEDOM 
AND SO THE EMBOLDENED SCOTS TAKE THE WAR TO THE ENGLISH 
FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS THE SCOTS RAIDED HUGE AREAS OF NORTHERN ENGLAND 
REACHING AS FAR SOUTH AS YORKSHIRE 
ABBEYS AND CASTLES FELL CITIES PAID THE SCOTS OFF TO AVOID DESTRUCTION 
VILLAGES WERE TRASHED 
BORDER RAIDS ON A WEAKENED ENEMY WERE WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT 
BUT WHAT ROBERT THE BRUCE DID NEXT WAS UTTERLY UNEXPECTED 
IN MAY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN ROBERT BRUCE'S BROTHER EDWARD LANDED HERE IN NORTH EAST IRELAND NEAR CARRICKFERGUS CASTLE 
WITH A FORMIDABLE SCOTS ARMY OF MANY THOUSANDS OF MEN 
WHAT THE BRUCES WERE DOING IN EFFECT WAS OPENING A SECOND FRONT AGAINST THE ENGLISH EMPIRE 
ROBERT HAD WRITTEN A REMARKABLE LETTER THE SCOTS WOULD COME HE SAID 
NOT AS AN INVADER BUT AS LIBERATORS FOR 
OUR PEOPLE AND YOUR PEOPLE FREE IN TIMES PAST 
SHARE THE SAME NATIONAL ANCESTRY AND COMMON CUSTOM 
THE RHETORIC WAS STIRRING AND IN PART IT FOUND RESONANCE WITH THE NATIVE IRISH 
FOR NEARLY A CENTURY AND A HALF THERE HAD BEEN AN ENTRENCHED ENGLISH COLONY IN NORTH AND EASTERN IRELAND 
OFTEN SAFE ONLY IN CASTLES LIKE CARRICKFERGUS 
WHICH EDWARD BRUCE NOW BESIEGED FOR A YEAR 
BUT THE TIMING WAS UNFORTUNATE 
FOR ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN ALSO SAW THE WORST FAMINE IN LIVING MEMORY 
VERY SOON EDWARD BRUCE'S ARMY BECAME INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM ANY OTHER DISORDERLY GANG OF KNIGHTS 
USING FORCE TO EXTRACT THE PROVISIONS THEY DESPERATELY NEEDED FOR THEIR MEN AND ANIMALS 
AND NOT CHOOSING TO DISTINGUISH WITH ANY CARE BETWEEN GAELIC FRIENDS AND ENGLISH FOES 
FAMISHED AND DESPERATE THE SCOTS SOLDIERS TOOK WHAT THEY NEEDED FROM IRISH VILLAGES FINALLY RESORTING 
SO IT WAS SAID TO DIGGING UP FRESH GRAVES AND EATING THE DECAYED BODIES 
MONTH BY MONTH THE BRUCES' WAR OF LIBERATION TURNED INTO SOMETHING REMARKABLY LIKE AN OCCUPATION 
AMBITIOUS EDWARD BRUCE ALSO WANTED TO BE A KING A KING IN DUBLIN 
AND HE DIDN'T MUCH CARE WHAT TAKING THE THRONE WOULD COST THE IRISH 
IT WAS THE USUAL STORY A VICTORY OVER THE ULSTER ENGLISH THEN A MARCH SOUTH TOWARDS DUBLIN 
THERE MANY OF THE POPULATION TORE DOWN THEIR OWN HOUSES TO USE AS WALLS AGAINST THE SCOTS 
RATHER THAN SURRENDER THE CITY 
NOT ALL THE IRISH NOBILITY AND KINGS OPENED THEIR ARMS TO EMBRACE THEIR SCOTS LIBERATORS 
A BITTER CIVIL WAR BROKE OUT BETWEEN IRISH SUPPORTERS OF BOTH SIDES 
A CLIMACTIC BATTLE IN THE WEST TOOK ACCORDING TO CONTEMPORARIES NO FEWER THAN TEN THOUSAND LIVES 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN EDWARD BRUCE WAS HIMSELF KILLED BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR THE SCOTS HAD LEFT 
PERHAPS THE EXPERIMENT OF COLLABORATION ACROSS THE NORTH CHANNEL DESERVED TO FAIL 
BECAUSE FROM THE BEGINNING ROBERT THE BRUCE HAD HIS OWN RATHER THAN HIS IRISH BROTHERS' INTERESTS AT HEART 
NEEDING A SECOND FRONT TO DIVERT CRITICAL ENGLISH MILITARY RESOURCES FROM SCOTLAND TO IRELAND 
NOT FOR THE LAST TIME THE IRISH WERE BEING USED IN SOMEONE ELSE'S QUARREL 
AS GRIM AS THE STORY OF THE SCOTS IN IRELAND WAS 
THEY DID LEAVE BEHIND SOMETHING OTHER THAN WIDOWS AND TRAGIC BALLADS 
THE ANGLO NORMAN COLONY STOPPED EXPANDING FROM ITS BASE IN ULSTER AND LEINSTER 
THE IDEA OF THE UNSTOPPABLE ENGLISH EMPIRE OF THE PLANTAGENETS 
HAD THE SHINE KNOCKED RIGHT OFF ITS MYTH OF INVINCIBILITY 
AND NOT LEAST THE BRUCES GAVE IRISH LEADERS THEIR VOICE OF RESISTANCE 
AN EXPRESSION OF NATIONAL IDENTITY 
TO RECOVER OUR NATIVE FREEDOM THE IRISH 
FOR AS LONG AS BUT A HUNDRED OF US REMAIN ALIVE WE WILL YIELD IN NO LEAST WAY TO ENGLISH DOMINION 
THE PEOPLE PREFERRED TO DIE RATHER THAN LIVE UNDER ENGLISH RULE 
ALL THESE STARTLINGLY MODERN SOUNDING DECLARATIONS OF NATIONAL COMMUNITY COME TOGETHER 
AS THE EPITAPH OF THE IDEA OF THE PLANTAGENET EMPIRE OF BRITAIN 
YOU HEAR THIS LANGUAGE ELOQUENT FIERCE RIGHTEOUSLY BELLIGERENT 
AND YOU HEAR A VOICE WHICH FOR BETTER OR WORSE WOULD SHOUT ROAR AND LAMENT DOWN THROUGH THE AGES 
ROBERT THE BRUCE OUTLIVED BOTH EDWARDS AND WHILE WAR WOULD CONTINUE WITH ENGLAND FOR GENERATIONS 
THE SCOTS HAD WON ENGLISH RECOGNITION OF THEIR TRULY INDEPENDENT KINGDOM 
THIS IS NOT WHAT LONG SHANKS IMAGINED WHEN HE HAD BEEN CROWNED BEFORE HIS NAMESAKE THE CONFESSOR'S TOMB 
OR WHEN HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF UPON THE STONE OF SCONE 
EDWARD'S ATTEMPT TO POUND THE NATIONS OF BRITAIN INTO A UNITED SUPERSTATE 
ENDED UP JUST REINFORCING THEIR ACUTE SENSE OF DIFFERENCE 
THE HAMMER THAT EDWARD HAD TAKEN TO THE SCOTS 
HAD REBOUNDED FATALLY AGAINST HIS DREAM OF A REBORN BRITANNIA 
FOR THE COST OF ALL THOSE ENDLESS MARCHES AND MILE UPON MILE OF CASTLE WALLS 
WAS POLITICAL AS WELL AS FINANCIAL 
IT MEANT THAT PARLIAMENT WAS MORE NOT LESS NECESSARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND 
IT WAS PARLIAMENT WHICH HAD TO AGREE ON HOW TO FOOT THE BILLS AND HOW BIG THOSE BILLS OUGHT TO BE 
EDWARD THE SECOND OF COURSE COMPLETELY FAILED TO BRING ANY ATTENTION TO THIS NEW REALITY 
FALLING BACK ON RULE BY FAVOURITES 
EDWARD MADE HIMSELF AN ALIEN IN HIS OWN LAND 
THE NOBILITY FAILED TO REMOVE HIM BUT HIS WIFE SUCCEEDED 
LEGEND HAS IT THAT HE WAS KILLED IN BERKELEY CASTLE FROM A HOT IRON THRUST UP HIS RECTUM 
EDWARD'S MURDER WAS PROOF THAT THE KING COULD BE REMOVED EVEN PHYSICALLY DISPOSED OF 
IF HE BETRAYED THE COMMUNITY 
BUT ENGLAND WOULD GET A NEW KING MORE THE HEIR TO EDWARD I THAN EDWARD THE SECOND 
BUT EDWARD THE THIRD KNEW HE COULDN'T ACHIEVE ANYTHING SIMPLY BY ACTS OF BRUTAL IMPERIAL WILL 
HE'D LEARNED SOMETHING FROM THE LONG WARS OF PLANTAGENET BRITAIN 
HE'D LEARNED THAT HIS POWER DEPENDED NOT JUST ON FORCE BUT ON CONSENT 
ON THE CONSENT OF HIS BARONS AND HIS CHURCHMEN 
ON THE CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT ON THE CONSENT OF THE ENGLISH COMMUNITY OF THE REALM 
NOT FOR THE FIRST OR THE LAST TIME 
IT WOULD TAKE THE REST OF BRITAIN TO TEACH ENGLAND JUST HOW TO BE A NATION 
THERE IS MUCH MORE TO DISCOVER AND DEBATE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF BRITAIN ON THE B. B. C. HISTORY WEBSITE
