OUST VOTES THERE LET'S GO OVER TO 
THE PANEL JOHN NIAMH OR RACHEL 
WHO MIGHT HAVE THE STAGE PRESENCE 
TO DO THIS IN THE WEST END 
I THINK 
THEY BOTH HAVE THE STAGE PRESENCE 
NIAMH WAS CONFIDENT SECURE A 
GREAT VOICE BUT TONIGHT FOR ME 
DICTION WAS THE PROBLEM ANDREW 
SAID IT'S ABOUT WORDSDY NOT 
UNDERSTAND EVERY WORD NANCY TELLS 
A STORY AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT 
STORY RACHEL YOU HAVE SET THE BAR 
FOR TONIGHT I'M SORRY IF WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT STORY AND WORDS AND 
EVERYTHING THAT WAS A STORY 
BARRY NEXT 
NIAMH THAT WAS WILD 
AND WAYWARD L. THINK YOU REALLY 
BROUGHT A NEW ASPECT TO THE 
CHARACTER IT SHOWED ANOTHER ASPECT 
OF YOUR OWN GREAT TALENT L. THOUGHT 
THAT WAS TERRIFIC NANCY IT WAS 
AN AMY WINEHOUSE SONG OF COURSE 
AND I THINK THE ORIGINAL NANCY WAS 
PROBABLY LIKE AMY WINEHOUSE 
THINK YOU'LL 
DISAPPOINT THE FANS 
I'M ONE OF THEM BY THE WAY 
RACHEL I AGREE I THOUGHT THAT WAS 
YOUR BEST PERFORMANCE SO FAR IN THE 
COMPETITION COMPETITION O. K. DENISE O. K. NIAMH I LOVE YOU 
AS A PERFORMER BUT FOR ME TONIGHT 
THAT LACKED PUNCH ESPECIALLY AT THE 
START IT FELT A LITTLE BIT LIKE 
YOU WERE MARKING IT NOT GIVING IT 
A FULL PERFORMANCE AND YOU HELD 
BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THAT WE NEED 
TO SEE MORE FROM YOU BECAUSE 
YOU'RE SO FRAGILE YOU HAVE TO 
PROVE YOU'RE RIGHT FOR THIS ROLE L. 
COULDN'T UNDERSTAND SOME WORDS 
WERE YOU SINGING RACHEL A VERY 
STRONG PERFORMANCE AGAIN FROM YOU 
WEEK AFTER WEEK YOU ARE VERY 
CONSIST DENT YOU ACT VERY WELL 
BUT I FIND YOU YOU HAVE HAD A 
COUPLE OF VERY INTENSE SONGS OVER 
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS SO NOW

TO SEE SOMETHING WARMER AND PLAYFUL 
SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NANCY AND 
OLIVER AND DODGER AND THE BOYS

DIFFICULTY BECAUSE THE CHOREOGRAPHY 
PROBABLY DIDN'T REALLY HELP YOU 
THAT'S A SONG THAT'S QUITE PERSONAL 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WORDS HERE

LOST A BIT OF JESSIE IN THE PAST 
WEEK BUT I HOPE I CAN GET THE 
CHANCE TO COME BACK NEXT WEEK AND 
SHOW YOU JESSIE AGAIN 
YES SURE 
SARAH LOVELY YOU HAVE A GREAT 
VOICE I THINK SARAH BUT STILL A 
LIT BIT FOR ME THE GIRL NEXT DOOR 
REMEMBER NANCY COMES FROM THE 
SLUMS AND STREETS OF THE EAST END 
OF LONDON YOU'VE GOT SOME OF THAT 
EDGE L. WANT YOU TO SUSTAIN IT 
NEXT WEEK I WANT TO SEE MORE OF

THIS WEEK WORRY FOCUSING ON THAT THE ACTING AS THE LORD SAID L. 
COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH YOU BARRY 
I THINK SARAH YOU'RE A VERY 
INTELLIGENT PERFORMANCE AND AN 
ACTRESS 
THANK YOU ACTRESS I THINK

IN THIS COMPETITION SO FAR IT'S SO 
REAL WITH YOU YOU CAN SEE YOU 
THINKING ABOUT THE WORDS YOU FEEL 
EVERYTHING AND WE DO WHEN YOU'RE 
PERFORMING 
THANK YOU

UNBEATABLE FANTASTIC L. CAN SEE 
THAT YOU'RE HOLDING BACK A LITTLE 
BIT L. KNOW WE'VE GIVEN YOU 
CRITIQUEED YOU AND SAID YOU NEED TO 
WORK ON YOUR POSTURE AND EVERYTHING

I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU THAT 
YOU FLY THROUGH THIS COMPETITION 
DOING WHAT YOU'RE BEST AT AND 
THAT'S BEING YOU 
THANK YOU JOHN JOHN IT IS THE HALFWAY MARK WHAT DID 
YOU THINK TONIGHT 
JESSIE FIRST OF 
ALL I FEEL WE'VE LOST YOUR ESSENCE

YOU NEED TO DO A U. TURN BECAUSE 
WHAT I'M SEEING FROM THE OTHER 
GIRLS WE ARE GIVING THEM THE 
CRITIQUE THE OTHER STUFF THEY'RE 
TELLING THEM AND YOU'RE NOT FIXING 
IT YET WE NEED TO STEP BACK 
RELOOK AND GET JESSIE BACK TO WHERE 
SHE WAS 
DOES THIS MEAN SHE CAN'T 
TAKE DIRECTION WELL 
CAN I JUST SAY 
THAT I THINK WITH THIS WEEK I WAS 
SO CONSCIOUS OF FEELING LIKE THERE 
WERE SO MANY ASPECTS THAT I HAVE 
TOO IMPROVE ON MY ACCENT AND 
MOVEMENT AND EVERYTHING AND I KNOW 
I DO HAVE TO DO THAT AND I THINK I 
DID BECOME A BIT MORE CONSCIOUS 
THIS WEEK AND I THINK 
WHOEVER YOU 
WORK WITH ON YOUR PRODUCTION YOUR 
DIRECTOR WILL GIVE 
WE'LL SARAH SARAH I THINK YOU DID WONDERFUL JOB 
WITH THE SONG TOLD THE STORY 
PERFECTLY IF YOU CONTINUE TO DO 
THAT THE LASHING LARK COULD BE 
SINGING HER WAY TO THE WEST END E.

TWO 
HEARTS THAT SHINE 
IT WILL BE HARD TO GET MY FEEDBACK

REALLY REALLY MAKE ME ONE HAPPY

BOX 
IN A MOMENT I'LL BE ASKING BOX ANDREW WHAT HE MEANT LAST WEEK 
JOHN YOUR THOUGHTS ON KEISHA 
FIRST 
I HAVE TO SAY THERE WERE A FIRST COUPLE OF NOTES THAT YOU CRACKED 
AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU DID HAVE 
VOCAL ISSUES AND AND TROUBLES 
YOU'RE A FIGHTER AND NANCY IS 
BLOSSOMING L. THOUGHT YOU DID TELL 
THE STORY OF THAT ANG ASHLEY I 
NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME YOUR 
SCOTTISH ACCENT IN THE SONG WHICH 
IS OVERCOMEABLE BUT THERE WERE 
SOME FLAT NOTES THERE L. THINK 
YOU'VE LOST SOME OF YOUR FIGHT 
BOO 
NOT AT ALL IF 
ANYTHING I WAS TRYING TO MAKE A 
WARMER INVITING BECAUSE I CAN 
STAND AND BELT IT 
I UNDERSTAND 
THE WARMER END MUCH IT BUT I'M 
GOING TO USE THIS WORD BUT I GOT A 
LITTLE BIT OF CHEESE WHEN YOU WERE 
DOING THE WARM DENISE 
O. K. I'LL DENISE START WITH ASHLEY THIS TIME 
BECAUSE I DO AGREE WITH JOHN THERE 
I HAVE TO ADMIT I FOUND THAT 
SLIGHTLY CHEESY AT MOMENTS 
ALTHOUGH I CAN SEE WHAT YOU WERE 
TRYING TO DO WITH IT 
VERY BRAVE 
BUT YOU MADE SOME OF THE WRONG 
CHOICES THERE WITH THE LYRICS I I WANTED TO PUT MYSELF OUT THERE AND 
SHOW THAT I DO WHATEVER IT TAKES 
WHAT ABOUT KEISHA 
THAT WAS THE 
BEST PERFORMANCE I'VE SEEN FROM YOU 
SO FAR IN THIS COMPETITION 
I THINK THE SONG SONG SUITED YOUR 
VOICE FOR ONCE YOU CONNECTED WITH 
THE WORDS THE ONLY THING YOU NEED 
TO BE CAREFUL OF BECAUSE IT'S 
DISTRACTING WHEN YOU PERFORM YOU 
DO A LOT OF HEAD WOBBLING IT'S SO 
DISTRACTING WORK ON THAT MUCH 
BETTER 
LET'S GO TO BARRY KEISHA BETTER KEISHA THAT WAS GREAT SONG OF SURVIVAL 
AND I THINK THE BEST YET FROM YOU 
I JUST WONDER THOUGH ARE YOU AN 
ENSEMBLE PLAYER OR A SOLOIST IT'S 
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO TELL AT THE 
MOMENT MOMENT ASHLEY WELL I LIKE THAT 
CALADONIAN GUTSINESS THAT YOU 
FORMALLY SHOW CAN SEE WHAT YOU 
WERE DOING THERE BUT FOR ME IT WAS 
JUST LITTLE 
BIT NICE A LITTLE BIT POLITE IT WAS AS THOUGH WERE 
YOU SHOWING ME TO THE BEST TABLE IN 
A RESTAURANT IT WAS LITTLE BIT 
LIKE THAT PROBABLY THE DRESS BUT 
STILL I SEE GREAT GIFTS THERE 
ANDREW TWO GIRLS HERE YOU'VE 
SAVED BOTH OF THEM WHAT DO YOU 
THINK AS BOTH OF THEM 
I'M IN AN 
UNEASY CHAIR TONIGHT L. THINK 
ASHLEY YOU DID THE BEST 
PERFORMANCE I'VE HEARD YOU BUT I 
STILL WORRY 
I'M GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU 
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME 
THINK THAT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU 
COULD HOLD AN AUDIENCE IN A WEST 
END THEATRE STAGE L. THINK KEISHA 
YOU CAME THROUGH IN A WAY THAT WAS 
VERY VERY REMARKABLE BUT WHAT I 
WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO BOTH OF YOU 
GIRLS IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS 
NOW I REALLY FEEL I WOULD LOVE TO 
HAVE WORKED WITH YOU THIS WEEK AND 
IF YOU BOTH COME THROUGH NEXT WEEK 
I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU BECAUSE 
I'M JUST NOT QUITE SURE NOW L. 
THINK BOTH OF YOU HAVE GOT 
SOMETHING BUT IT'S JUST NOT QUITE 
CONNECTING KEISHA YOU'VE DONE 
BETTER AND ASHLEY YOU'VE DONE A 
LOT BETTER TOO BRAVO BOTH OF YOU 
WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO THE NITTY 
GRITTY NOW AND I HOPE I CAN HELP 
ONE OR OTHER OR BOTH OF YOU IF IF THEY WANT A CHANCE TO WORK WITH 
ANDREW YOU'LL HAVE TO VOTE FOR 
THEM IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO YOU TO 
DECIDE 
DECIDE DECIDE HERE'S THE NUMBER TO CALL LATER 
STILL TO COME SAMANTHA AND JODIE 
GO ALL OUT FOR YOUR VOTES LET'S 
REVIEW THE OLIVER SITUATION AND 
FIND OUT WHICH OF OUR BUDDING 
LEADING MEN IS NEXT TO GO THROUGH 
TO THE SEMI FINAL 
SO FAR ALL BUDDING OLIVERS MADE IT 
THROUGH TO THE SEMI FINAL BEING BEING OLIVER WOULD MEAN EVERYTHING TO BEING ME 
TO THINK THAT I COULD PERFORM IN 
THE WEST END IT JUST REALLY MAKES 
ME FEEL AMAZING

ENJOYING ALL THE EXPERIENCE AND 
WORKING WITH THE NANCYS IT'S IT'S UNBELIEVABLE I'VE GOT THIS FAR MY
