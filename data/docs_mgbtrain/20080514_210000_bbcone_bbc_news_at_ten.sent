LIVING WILL RISE EVEN MORE SHARPLY 
THIS YEAR AS GROWTH SLOWS TO A 
SNAIL'S PACE 
FOR THE TIME BEING AT 
LEAST THE NICE DECADE IS BEHIND US 
WE WILL BE ASKING IF ALL THIS MEANS 
NO FURTHER CUTS IN INTEREST RATES 
ALSO TONIGHT AFTER CHINA'S 
EARTHQUAKE THE DEATH TOLL RISES TO 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND MANY PEOPLE ARE STILL 
DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR LOVED 
ONES 
PEOPLE ARE REASONABLY DESPERATE 
HERE THEY ARE TRYING TO GET INSIDE 
THIS BUILDING TO TRY TO FIND OUT 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEIR MISSING 
RELATIVES TWO DAYS AFTER DISASTER 
STRUCK PEOPLE ARE STILL BEING FOUND 
ALIVE AS THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY PROMISES MORE HELP THE 
B. B. C. LEARNS OF A PLAN TO PRIVATISE 
ROYAL MAIL WE HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE 
REPORT MANCHESTER OVERFLOWS WITH 
RANGERS FANS FOR TONIGHT'S BIG 
MATCH MATCH 
IT'S BAD NEWS FOR THE SCOTS IN THE 
UEFA CUP FINAL 
IN B. B. C. LONDON NEWS A DAMNING 
DIAGNOSIS PATIENTS SAY THE U. K.'S 
WORST HOSPITALS ARE IN THE CAPITAL 
THE WOMAN WITH THE MULTI MILLION 
POUND BODY THIS ARTIST'S MUSE 
WON'T SEE PENNY 
GOOD EVENING THE NICE DECADE IS 
BEHIND US WITH THOSE WORDS THE 
GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
DELIVERED HIS BLEAKEST ASSESSMENT 
OF BRITAIN'S ECONOMIC PROSPECTS 
MERVYN KING FORECAST MUCH HIGHER 
INFLATION AND MUCH LOWER GROWTH 
MITT HE BLAMED THE TOUGH CONDITIONS 
ON RISING ENERGY COSTS AND FOOD 
PRICES AS WELL AS THE CREDIT CRISIS 
FIRST TONIGHT THIS REPORT FROM OUR 
ECONOMICS EDITOR STEPHANIE FLANDERS 
RISING PRICES AND A SQUEEZE ON 
INCOMES YOU MAY THINK THINGS ARE 
DIFFICULT NOW BUT THE LINE FROM 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND TODAY IS THAT 
YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET I'VE I'VE GOT A MORTGAGE I WILL BE PAYING 
MORE EVERYTHING IS GETTING MORE 
EXPENSIVE AT THE MOMENT 
THE ECONOMY 
IS A DISGRACE 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY 
THAT YOU LOOK AT THIS CITY CENTRE 
THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING SORING 
FOOD AND ENERGY PRICES HAVE ALREADY 
SET INFLATION UP TO THREE PER CENT THAT IS THREE PER CENT 
HOLE IN THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET THE 
HOLE IS BIGGER WHEN IT COMES TO 
BUYING THINGS LIKE BREAD AND MILK 
MERVYN KING'S MESSAGE TODAY WAS 
THAT INFLATION WAS GOING TO GET 
WORSE THERE IS NOT MUCH HE CAN DO 
FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST THE 
NICE DECADE IS BEHIND US THE 
CREDIT CYCLE HAS TURNED COMODITY 
PRICES ARE RISING WE ARE 
TRAVELLING ALONG A BUMPY ROAD AS 
THE ECONOMY REBALANCES MONETARY 
POLICY CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT TRY TO 
PREVENT THAT ADJUSTMENT THREE THREE MONTHS AGO THE BANK THOUGHT THAT 
INFLATION WOULD PEAK AT AROUND THREE PER CENT 
NOW IT'S BEST GUESS IS IT WILL GO 
TO THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT THEY ARE FEELING THE PAIN 
AT THIS NEW RETAIL DEVELOPMENT IN 
LIVERPOOL A YEAR AGO RETAILERS 
WOULD HAVE BEEN FALLING OVER 
THEMSELVES TO GET A SPOT HERE NOW 
THEY MAY OPEN WITH EMPTY SLOTS 
SPENDING SPREES WON'T BE AS COMMON 
AS THEY WERE THAT WAS MERVYN 
KING'S SECOND PIECE OF BAD NEWS 
OUR REAL INCOMES ARE GOING TO GET 
SQUEEZED 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SQUEEZED THE SQUEEZE ON REAL INCOME THAT IS 
IS COMING FROM THE RISE IN ENERGY 
PRICES FOOD PRICES IMPORT PRICES 
IS AFFECTING SPENDING POWER RIGHT 
ACROSS THE ECONOMY THAT IS THE 
MAIN FACTOR WHICH HAS LED TO THE 
DOWNGRADING OF OUR FORECASTS FOR 
GROWTH DURING THE PAST THREE MONTHS 
THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T EXPECT AN ALL 
OUT RECESSION HE THINKS WE ARE 
HEADING FOR SLOWER GROWTH WITH 
INFLATION SO HIGH THE BANK WILL 
NEED A LOT MORE EVIDENCE OF A SLOW 
DOWN BEFORE WE GET THE FURTHER CUTS 
IN INTEREST RATES WE WERE EXPECTING 
SADLY IT NEEDS THINGS TO BE TOUGH 
BECAUSE THE TOUGHER THINGS ARE THE 
HARDER IT WILL BE FOR RETAILERS TO 
PASS ON HIGHER PRICES TO SHOPPERS 
OR TO GET HIGHER WAGES TO PAY OUR 
BILLS THINGS LOOK BRIGHTER IF YOU 
DON'T WORK AT AN ESTATE OR BANK 
IN A SHIPYARD SAY 
WE ARE A 
SIGNIFICANT PLAYER IN THE U. K. SHIP 
REPAIR AND CONVERSION MARKET PLACE 
WE WANT TO BUILD ON THAT SUCCESS 
AND TAKE THAT ON TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL STAGE WHERE I 
BELIEVE WE WILL BE VERY VERY 
SUCCESSFUL 
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS SUCCESSFUL THAT VERY FEW OF US WILL ESCAPE 
THIS ECONOMIC SQUEEZE THE ONLY 
GOOD NEWS IS THAT EVEN THE GLOOMY 
GOV NOR THINK THAT IS THIS TOO WILL 
PASS DOSH GOVERNOR AS THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND DELIVERED ITS GLOOMY 
PREDICTION THE PRIME MINISTER WAS 
OUTLINING HIS GOALS FOR THE YEAR 
AHEAD HE STHAID HELPING FAMILY 
FINANCES AND FIRST TIME BUYERS WERE 
HIS IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES OUR 
POLITICAL EDITOR NICK ROBINSON HAS 
THIS REPORT THESE ARE THE HANDS OF 
THE MAN WHO SAYS HE HAS THE BEST 
JOB IN THE WORLD NO REALLY TODAY 
GORDON BROWN ASKED THE PUBLIC FOR 
THEIR VIEWS ON HIS PLANS FOR THE 
FUTURE CALL IT A RELAUNCH CALL IT 
A FIGHT BACK CALL IT WHAT YOU LIKE 
SHE TRYING TO SHAPE EVENTS RATHER 
THAN BEING BATTERED BY THEM 
I ASK 
AND INDEED EXPECT TO BE JUDGED BY 
THIS TEST AND BUILDING A LASTING 
PROSPERITY BY RELEASING THE 
UNTAPPED POTENTIAL OF MILLIONS OF 
PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY 
THE DAY 
AFTER THE EMERGENCY BUDGET CAME THE 
SNEAK PREVIEW OF THE NEXT QUEEN'S 
SPEEFPLT 
A 
BANKING BILL TO SUPPORT SPEEFPLT BANKING STABILITY AN EDUCATION 
BILL TO ENSURE EVERY SCHOOL A GOOD 
SCHOOL REFORMS ON AGENCY WORKERS 
ON SCALES AND ON FLEXIBLE WORKING 
THESE ARE THE PRIORITIES I COMMEND 
THIS STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE THAT THAT IS QUITE A LOT OF THAT PRIORITIES THE 
EIGHTEEN PROPOSED NEW LAWS WILL BUILD A 
FAYER MORE PROSPEROUS BRITAIN 
WILL GET TO SHAPE THE 
SERVICE THEY GET FROM SCHOOLS 
POLICE AND N. H. S. AUND NEW N. H. S. 
CONSTITUTION PATIENTS MAY DECIDE 
WHETHER HOSPITALS ARE PAID LESS IF 
THEY ARE TREATED BADLY AT WORK 
PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO DEPLANNED 
TIME OFF FOR TRAINING AND FLEXIBLE 
HOURS TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN 
GORDON BROWN ALSO ANNOUNCED PLANS 
TO ALLOW THE LOW PAID TO BUY A 
SHARE OF A HOME WITH THE GOVERNMENT 
OWNING THE REST THE TORY LEADERS 
RESPONSE IN THE COMMONS BEGAN WITH 
A SURPRISE 
THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS 
OF THINGS IN THIS STATEMENT THAT WE 
WELCOME NOT LEAST BECAUSE WE 
PROPOSED THEM 
THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH 
TO STOP HIM POURING SCORN ON THE 
ENTIRE PACKAGE 
TODAY'S QUEEN'S 
SPEECH IS ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO SAVE 
THE PRIME MINISTER'S SKIN IT WON'T 
WASH PEOPLE CAN SEE A GOVERNMENT 
NOT JUST A PRIME MINISTER THAT HAS 
RUN OUT OF RODE RUN OUT OF MONEY 
AND IDEAS 
THE LIB DEM LEADER 
JOINED IN KICKING A MAN WHEN HE WAS 
DOWN 
THIS LONG LEDGE STATIVE LIST DOWN IS A RAG BAG OF 
HE 
IS 
ADDRESSING THINGS THE GOVERNMENT 
SAID WEREN'T A PROBLEM LIKE THE 
ECONOMY OR TRYING TO TURN AROUND 
PROBLEMS THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF 
CREATED 
THIS IS 
THE WEEK ONE OF CREATED THE PRIME MINISTER'S ALLIES TOLD ME 
WHEN HE IS TRYING TO REOPEN A 
DIALOGUE WITH THE ELECTORATE YOU YOU MANAGED TO KEEP THE DISCUSSION 
UNDER CONTROL 
HIS AIM FOR NOW 
LIMITED TO STOP THE ROT TO STILL 
THE MUTTERING TO HALT THE SLIDE 
WE CAN TALK TO NICK NOW IN DOWNING 
STREET IS THERE A SENSE TODAY THAT 
MR. BROWN'S INITIATIVE WAS REALLY 
OVERSHADOWED BY MERVYN KING'S 
GLOOMY MESSAGE 
INEVITABLY A 
WARNING THAT PEOPLE WILL FACE 
HIGHER INFLATION LOWER GROWTH 
EVEN NEGATIVE GROWTH IN SOME 
QUARTERS WAS BOUND TO OVERSHADOW A 
LIST OF EIGHTEEN PROPOSED BILLS L. THINK 
THE PRIME MINISTER KNOWS THAT AND 
WON'T BE TOO WORRIED THIS 
EXTRAORDINARY WEEK OF THE MINI 
BUDGET AND THE DRAFT QUEEN SPEECH 
AND TOMORROW A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS 
AND INDEED A PRIME MINISTERIAL NEWS 
CONFERENCE WAS I BELIEVE FIRST 
AND FOREMOST ABOUT CALMING THE 
PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY RATHER 
THAN THE COUNTRY LANCING THE BOIL 
ON THE ISSUE OF TEN P. TRYING TO SHOW 
THERE WAS A FORWARD AGENDA 
INCLUDING SOME OF THOSE FAVOURITES 
LIKE AGENCY WORKERS THAT LABOUR M. P.'S 
ARE CONCERNED SO MUCH ABOUT AND 
YES I'M ALSO TOLD TRYING TO 
CONVINCE PEOPLE NOT TO REBELL ON 
ISSUES LIKE DETENTION FOR FORTY TWO DAYS 
THERE WAS A QUIZ TONIGHT FOR THE 
STAFF AT NUMBER TEN DOWNING STREET 
IF THE QUESTION HAD BEEN ASKED DO 
YOU THINK ALL OF THIS WILL BE 
ENOUGH TO SAVE LABOUR FROM LOSING 
THE CREWE AND NANTWICH BY ELECTION 
THE ANSWER WOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR 
ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT 
THANK YOU

CHINA'S RESPONSE TO THE DISASTER 
HAS BEEN UNPRECEDENTED AND THE 
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN FAR MORE 
WILLING THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST 
TO LET THE WORLD SEE WHAT IS GOING 
ON FIFTY THOUSAND SOLDIERS FROM THE

UNLEASHED SO MUCH DEVASTATION THE 
MOMENT THE EARTHQUAKE STRUCK TWO

RUNNING FOR OPEN SPACES NOT SURE

RESPONDED WITH A MASSIVE AID AND 
RESCUE PROGRAMME THE PEOPLE'S 
LIBERATION ARMY IS ON THE MOVE 
AROUND FIFTY THOUSAND SOLDIERS DRAFTED IN

VAST DAMN WALL COULD BE IN DANGER 
OF COLLAPSE THREATENING THE VERY 
AREA WHERE THE SCHOOL RESCUE IS

LEADERSHIP OFTEN RESMOT NOW CLOSER

GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU 
WE WILL FIND YOU A HOME WILL YOU 
GO BACK TO SCHOOL THE CHINESE 
AUTHORITIES ARE ACUTELY AWARE THEIR 
PEOPLE WILL JUDGE THEM HARSHLY IF 
RESPONSE TO DISASTER SEEMS 
INADEQUATE THE CHALLENGE TO SAVE 
AS MANY LIVES AS POSSIBLE AND THEN 
TO REBUILD IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING 
ROYAL MAIL SHOULD BE PARTLY 
PRIVATISED ACCORDING TO THE POSTAL 
REGULATOR POST CAM IS MAKING THE 
CONTENTIOUS PROPOSAL TO AN 
INDEPENDENT REVIEW ON THE FUTURE OF 
POSTAL SERVICES OUR BUSINESS 
EDITOR HAS THIS EXCLUSIVE REPORT 
IT'S THE GOOD OLD ROYAL MAIL 
PUBLICLY OWNED ONE OF THE LAST 
NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES FOR HOW 
MUCH LONGER A FOR SALE SIGN WOULD 
BE HUNG ON A CHUNK OF ROYAL MAIL IT 
WOULD BE PARTLY PRIVATISED THAT IS 
IF THE POSTAL REGULATOR CHAIRED BY 
NIGEL STAPLETON HA ITS WAY THEY THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CAPITAL TO 
RESTRUCTURE THEY DON'T HAVE THE 
RIGHT ALIGNED INCENTIVES AND 
COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL 
CONSIDERATION ARE SOMEWHAT MUDDYED 
SO WITH A MINORITY EQUITY POSITION 
FROM A PARTNER THAT CAN BRING 
MANAGEMENT AND CASH WE BELIEVE 
THAT THE CONSTRAINTS ON A RADICAL 
TRANSFORMATION OF ROYAL MAIL WILL 
BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WHAT WHAT WORRIES POSTCOMM IS THAT THE ONE 
PRICE LETTER SERVICE COULD WITHER 
UNLESS ROYAL MAIL'S BUSINESS IS 
MADE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT IT THINK 
IT CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH PRIVATE 
SECTOR HELP HERE'S WHAT IT SAYS IS 
WRONG 
WRONG AT ROYAL MAIL 
THERE IS A STAGGERING TWO POINT SIX BILLION 
SHORTFALL IN THE CASH ALL THE BITS 
OF ROYAL MAIL WERE SUPPOSED TO 
GENERATE BY TWO THOUSAND TEN IT'S CRIPPLED BY 
A MASSIVE FIVE BILLION DEFICIT IN ITS 
PENSION FUND 
A MASSIVE FIVE BILLION DEFICIT IN ITS PENSION FUND 
IT'S NOT A PAIN FREE 
SOLUTION FOR THIS MAN GORDON BROWN 
WANTS THE PART PRIVATISATION OF 
ROYAL MAIL ON HIS AGENDA LIKE HE 
WANTS A HOLE IN THE HEAD WHY MANY 
LABOUR M. P.'S HATE THE VERY IDEA THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS ONLY ITSELF TO BLAME 
WHEN IT SETUP THE INDEPENDENT 
POSTAL REVIEW IT KNEW THAT THE 
REGULATOR WAS BOUND TO RECOMMEND 
THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR SHOULD BE 
BROUGHT INTO THE LETTERS BUSINESS 
POSTCOMM BELIEVES A STAKE SHOULD BE 
PERHAPS BE OLD SOLD TO A PRIVATE 
EBGQUITH WITTY FIRM 
VIEWED BY LABOUR M. P.'S AS OVERPAID 
AND TOO RUTHLESS IT IS THIS 
SCANDINAVIAN THAT POSTCOMM VIEWS AS 
A POSSIBLE MODEL FOR ROYAL MAIL 
BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT THE DANISH 
POST OFFICE HAS BEEN MADE MUCH MORE 
EFFICIENT SINCE A BIG BRITISH PRY 
VIE WAIT EQUITY FIRM BOUGHT A STAKE 
IN IT POSTCOMM THINK THAT IS THE 
LIKES OF C. B. C. COULD WORK WONDERS FOR 
ROYAL MAIL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
ROYAL MAIL'S EMPLOYEES AND MILLIONS 
OF ITS CUSTOMERS MAY RESPOND ON 
YOUR BIKE ROBERT IF GORDON BROWN 
IS PRESENTED WITH THIS PROPOSAL 
WHAT IS HE LIKELY TO DO 
THIS IS A 
DEEPLY DEVICIVE ISSUE WITHIN THE 
LABOUR PARTY PART PRIVATISATION IS 
SOMETHING THAT LABOUR M. P.'S HAVE 
SIGNALLED ALREADY THEY DON'T LIKE 
THE ALTERNATIVES FOR GORDON BROWN 
ARE PRETTY DREADFUL POSTCOMM SAYS 
THAT WITHOUT PRIVATE SECTOR CASH 
PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERTISE THE 
GOVERNMENT COULD BE FORCED TO PAY A 
SUBSTANTIAL SUBSIDY AN ADDITIONAL 
SUBSIDY INTO THE ROYAL MAIL AS WE 
KNOW THE PUBLIC FINANCES ARE TIGHT 
GORDON BROWN DOESN'T HAVE THE CASH 
SO THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS 
EQUALLY UNPALATABLE IS THAT THE 
SERVICE THAT MILLION OF US DEPEND 
UPON FROM ROYAL MAIL COULD 
DETERIORATE I HAVE HERE THE ONE HUNDRED 
PAGE REPORT FROM POSTCOMM ON ALL OF 
THIS IT SAYS THAT DISCONTINUING 
SATURDAY DELIVERIES AND SELECTION 
COLLECTIONS WOULD YIELD TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY 
MILLION OF SAVINGS EVERY YEAR 
POSTCOMM SAID TO ME NIGEL 
STAPLETON SAID HE DOESN'T WANT 
THOSE DELIVERS TO BE ABANDONED 
UNLESS THIS PART PRIVATISATION 
HAPPENS THINGS LIKE SATURDAY 
DELIVERY COULD GO 
COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
HOW SPAIN'S HOUSING SLUMP PUTS 
BRITAIN'S PROBLEMS INTO THE SHADE 
HOW IT ALL ENDED IN TEARS FOR 
THOUSANDS OF RANGERS FANS IN THE 
UEFA CUP TONIGHT 
HILLARY CLINTON HAS WON THE LATEST 
STAGE OF THE CONTEST FOR THE 
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION 
HER COMFORTABLE VICTORY IN WEST 
VIRGINIA EXPOSED BARACK OBAMA'S 
DIFFICULTY IN WINNING OVER WHITE 
WORKING CLASS PEOPLE 
TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THIS OUTRAGE OUTRAGE IN GEORGIA T. SHIRT'S ON SALE 
WITH THE CLEAR MESSAGE THAT BARACK 
OBAMA LOOKS LIKE MONKEY RACE AND 
RACIAL SLURS ARE NOW A PART OF THE 
MIX IN THIS ELECTION SEASON EVEN 
IN OH OH EIGHT THEY STILL MATTER THEY 
STILL HURT AND THOSE CAUSING THE 
OFFENCE STILL REFUSE TO STOP I I SAW THAT CHARACTER HERE AND I 
THOUGHT HIS EARS AND HAIR LOOKS 
LIKE OBAMA AND THE SMILE 
PART OF 
THE REASON RACE MATTERS IS THE 
CLINTON RESURGANCE AND LATE DASH 
FOR THE NOMINATION IS COMING ON THE 
BACKS OF WHITE WORKING CLASS MRS. 
CLINTON'S STOX THEIR FIRE SHE SAYS 
SHE'S WINNING IT FOR THEM THE THE TEACHER THE COAL MINER THE 
TRUCKER THE SOLDIER VETERAN AND 
COLLEGE STUDENT 
SHE DIDN'T MENTION 
RACE LAST NIGHT BUT IN A RECENT 
PHONE INTERVIEW TO THE SURPRISE AND 
HORROR TO SOME SHE DID BARACK BARACK OBAMA'S SUPPORT AMONG HARD WORKING 
AMERICANS WHITE AMERICANS IS 
WEAKENING AGAIN 
OBAMA KNOWS WHAT 
IT MEANS LIVING IN A COUNTRY AND 
BEING WHRACK THE POLARISATION IN 
RECENT WEEKS IS CAUSED BY A BLACK 
MAN BARACK OBAMA'S FORMER PASTOR 
HAS DONE NOTHING TO HELP THE 
CANDIDATE TRANSCEND THE RACE ISSUE 
IN WEST VIRGINIA THE POLL SUGGESTS 
THE RACE IS NOT A DRIVING FORCE BUT 
IS A PROBLEM TWO OUT OF TEN WHITE 
DEMOCRATS SAID RACE WAS A FACTOR 
POLLING EXPERTS SAY MANY MANY COULD 
BE BROUGHT INTO HIS CAMP 
IF HE 
DOES THINGS WHAT HE IS DOING TODAY 
CAMPAIGNING AMONG THE WHITE 
WORKING CLASS TAKING THEIR 
QUESTIONS HE WILL OVERCOME THE 
RACE PROBLEM IT IS NOT CERTAIN 
AND THIS ELECTION WILL BE A TEST OF 
WHAT KIND OF AMERICA WE HAVE THE THE SENATOR WAS IN A FACTORY TODAY HE 
FACES MANY MORE MEETINGS WITH WHITE 
WORKING PEOPLE IN THE WEEKS AHEAD 
HIS TEAM KNOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM 
THEY THINK THEY CAN CRACK IT WELL 
WE'VE BEEN REPORTING THE HOUSING 
MARKET IN BRITAIN IS COOLING 
RAPIDLY BUT IT IS NOT ON THE SCALE 
OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SPAIN 
VALUES HAVE FALLEN BY THIRTY PER CENT AND IT IS 
KEENLY FELT BY THE ONE MILLION 
BRITONS WHO LIVE THERE 
WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING FROM 
SOUTHERN SPAIN 
THE WEATHER IS 
LOOKING GLORIOUS OUT THERE SPECK SPECK STRUM RADIO RECKONS IT HAS A 
POTENTIAL OF ENGLISH SPEAKING 
AUDIENCE OF FIFTEEN MILLION ALONG THE 
SPANISH COAST THEY'RE DRAWN HERE 
BY SUNSHINE LAID BACK LIFESTYLE 
AND BOOMING ECONOMY SPAIN BUILT 
TOO MANY HOUSES AND PRICES HAVE 
SLUMPED MAXINE CAN'T GET A JOB AND 
CAN'T PAY HER MORTGAGE HER PARTNER 
DIED LEAVING HER WITH A SIX YEAR 
OLD SON SHE'D LIKE TO GO HOME BUT 
CAN'T NO ONE WILL BUY HER 
APARTMENT EVEN AT TWENTY PER CENT LESS THAN 
SHE PAID FOR T. 
THE OTHER OPTION IS 
TO WALK AWAY AND LET THE BANK HAVE 
IT WHICH MEANS WE LOSE ABSOLUTELY 
EVERYTHING EVERYTHING WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I 
REALLY WANT TO DO 
THIS IS WHAT 
HAPPENS WHEN HOUSE PRICES CRASH 
ROWS OF NEW HOMES STAND WAITING FOR 
BUYERS AND THE WHOLE ECONOMY IS 
SUFFERING THE FINANCE MINISTER 
WARNS BRITISH BUYERS NOT TO EXPECT 
A PROFIT 
IF THEY WANT PROPERTY TO LIVE IN 
THERE NEEDS 
TO BE CORRECT MOMENT TO FIND GOOD HOUSES IN SPAIN IF 
YOUR IDEA IS TO SPECULATE AND TO 
MAKE MONEY RAPIDLY IT IS NOT A 
GOOD MOMENT 
WITHOUT BUYERS THE 
BUILDERS ARE STOPPING WORK WHAT 
THE EXPERIENCE HERE IN SPAIN SHOWS 
IS HOW A HOUSING SLOWDOWN CAN FEED 
ON ITSELF 
IT REDUCE THE NUMBER OF JOBS 
AVAILABLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION 
INDUSTRY AND OTHER INDUSTRIES AND 
THEN PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE JOBS 
CAN'T PAY THEIR MORTGAGES AND SO 
THE HOUSING SLUMP GETS WORSE AND 
THE BRITISH ARE TAKING THEIR SHARE 
OF THE PAIN 
LOTS AND LOTS OF 
PEOPLE HAVE GONE HOME SINCE I'VE 
BEEN HERE TWO AND A HALF YEARS 
I'VE SEEN LOTS OF PEOPLE COME AND 
GO BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SURVIVE OUT 
HERE 
IN CHANGING TIMES SPAIN'S NO HERE LONGER A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN LEAVE 
YOUR TROUBLES BEHIND THERE WAS 
DISAPPOINTMENT FOR TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF RANGERS FANS TONIGHT 
THEY LOST THE UEFA CUP FINAL MINUS ONE 
WITH ZENIT WE WERE WATCHING THE 
RANGERS FANS HAD ALREADY TURNED 
MANCHESTER INTO A RAW COWS HEAVING 
MASS OF BLUE 
THE ONLY QUESTION AS THEY AND 
RUSSIAN RIVALS MADE THE PILGRIMAGE 
TO THE STADIUM WOULD THE GAME LIVE 
UP TO THE PRE MATCH PARTY THE 
EARLY EXCHANGES PROMISED MUCH AS 
FIRST THERE WAS A SHOT WIDE FROM 
THE RIDE 
FIRST THERE WAS A SHOT WIDE FROM THE RIDE 
IN 
THE SECOND HALF IT WAS 
RANGERS CONTESTING MORE POSSESSION 
WHO INITIALLY LOOKED THE MORE 
LIKELY DENISOV CAUSING PANIC IN 
THE DEFENCE BUT THEN THE MOMENT 
WHICH BROKE RANGERS' HEARTS A 
DEFENCE WHICH IT CONCEDED TWO GOALS 
IN THEIR EUROPEAN CAMPAIGN PIERCED 
BY IGOR DENISOV THE FACES SAID IT 
ALL THE UEFA CUP WAS HEADING TO SAINT 
PETERSBURG NOT TO GLASGOW WORSE 
WAS TO FOLLOW AS THE RUSSIAN SIDE 
SEALED THE MATCH DEEP INTO INJURY 
TIME ADVOCAAT ARCHITECT OF THE 
FORMER CLUB'S DEMISE RANGERS WERE 
DEFIANT TO THE END BUT CELEBRATIONS 
TONIGHT BELONG TO THE RUSSIANS 
RANGERS CAN STILL WIN A TREBLE OF 
DOMESTIC HONOURS BUT THIS WAS A 
BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE CLUB 
FOR THE FANS THE LONG JOURNEY HOME 
WILL SEEM JUST THAT LITTLE BIT 
LONGER THAT'S IT TO JOIN OUR NEWS TEAMS WHERE YOU ARE GOOD EVENING
