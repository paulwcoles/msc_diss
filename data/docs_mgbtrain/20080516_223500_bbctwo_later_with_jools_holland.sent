BACK IN THAT HOLE 
LARRY MADE HIS NEST UP IN THE AUTUMN BRANCHES 
MADE FROM NOTHING BUT HIGH HOPES AND THIN AIR 
HE COLLECTED UP SOME BABY BLASTED MOTHERS THEY TOOK THEIR CHANCES 
AND FOR A WHILE THEY LIVED QUITE HAPPILY UP THERE 
HE CAME FROM NEW YORK CITY MAN BUT HE COULDN'T TAKE THE PACE 
HE THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE A DOG EAT DOG WORLD 
THEN HE WENT TO SAN FRANCISCO SPENT A YEAR IN OUTER SPACE 
WITH A SWEET LITTLE SAN FRANCISCAN GIRL 
I CAN HEAR MY MOTHER WAILING 
AND A WHOLE LOT OF SCRAPING OF CHAIRS

MEANWHILE LARRY MADE UP NAMES FOR THE LADIES 
LIKE MISS BOO AND MISS QUICK 
HE STOCKPILED WEAPONS AND TOOK POTSHOTS IN THE AIR 
HE FEASTED ON THEIR BODIES LIKE A LUNATIC 
AND WRAPPED HIMSELF UP IN THEIR SOFT YELLOW HAIR 
I CAN HEAR CHANTS AND INCANTATIONS 
AND SOME GUY IS MENTIONING ME IN HIS PRAYERS 
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS 
BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING GOING ON UPSTAIRS 
LAZARUS DIG YOURSELF

FAME FINALLY FOUND HIM 
MIRRORS BECAME HIS TORTURERS 
CAMERAS SNAPPED HIM AT EVERY CHANCE 
THE WOMEN ALL WENT BACK TO THEIR HOMES AND THEIR HUSBANDS 
WITH SECRET SMILES IN THE CORNERS OF THEIR MOUTHS 
HE ENDED UP LIKE SO MANY OF THEM DO 
BACK ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK CITY 
IN A SOUP QUEUE A DOPE FIEND A SLAVE 
THEN PRISON THEN THE MADHOUSE 
THEN THE GRAVE 
AH POOR LARRY 
BUT WHAT DO WE REALLY KNOW OF THE DEAD

THE WONDERFUL SHARLEEN SPITERI 
WE'LL BE HEARING MORE FROM SHARLEEN IN A MOMENT 
NOW I'M ABOUT TO MEET A GUEST AND HAVE A CHAT AT THE PIANO 
SHE WAS IN ONE OF THE MOST LEGENDARY GROUPS OF ALL TIME REALLY 
THEY HAD SO MANY HITS THAT I BELIEVE EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM AND MANY OF YOU AT HOME WILL KNOW THEM 
LET'S JUST SEE SHALL WE 
STOP

YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE 
NO YOU JUST HAVE TO WAIT 
SHE SAID LOVE DON'T COME EASY 
WHAT IS IT 
IT'S A GAME OF GIVE AND TAKE 
IT CERTAINLY IS AND WE WELCOME MARY WILSON ONE TIME OF THE SUPREMES 
HOW YOU DOING HAVE A SEAT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S SO FANTASTIC YOU'RE HERE 
WOO HOO 
I'VE BEEN A FAN OF YOURS FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
OH YOU HAVE HOW LONG HOW LONG 
THERE'S A BIG EXHIBITION WELL EVER SINCE I STARTED 
ONE OF THE FIRST RECORDS I HAD WAS YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE O. K. 
YES I BOUGHT THAT I BOUGHT IT SINGLE VINYL I'VE HAD THE LOT O. K. 
YOU'VE GOT A FANTASTIC EXHIBITION AT THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM 
OF A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT SUPREMES THINGS THAT YOU'RE CLOSE TO 
IT'S CALLED THE SUPREMES MARY WILSON GOWN COLLECTION 
AND I HAVE ALL THE GOWNS WE WORE ON TOP OF THE POPS 
READY STEADY GO ED SULLIVAN ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS ARE THERE 
WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT IN A MOMENT BUT BEFORE WE GO TO THE GOWNS 
WHICH WE ARE GOING TO GO TO I WANT TO GO TO THE SUPREMES 
WHEN DID THE SUPREMES FIRST FORM 
WE STARTED SINGING IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE WE WERE LIKE THIRTEEN YEARS OLD 
WE BECAME WE HAD OUR FIRST HIT RECORD IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR IN MOTOWN RECORDS 
NOT ONE BUT YOU HAD I THINK TWELVE NUMBER ONES IN FIVE YEARS 
WE HAD FIVE CONSECUTIVE NUMBER ONES TO START OFF 
WE USED TO FIGHT WITH THE BEATLES ALL THE TIME 
THEY WERE NUMBER ONE WE WERE NUMBER TWO 
WE WERE NUMBER ONE THEY WERE NUMBER TWO 
THAT WAS WHEN A NUMBER ONE RECORD WAS SELLING MILLIONS 
NOW A NUMBER ONE RECORD IS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THEN IT WAS MILLIONS 
OH DARLING ECONOMICALLY IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP 
THEY'RE MAKING FAR MORE MONEY THAN WE EVER MADE 
DID MOTOWN ORGANISE EVERYTHING FOR YOU 
WELL YOU KNOW IT WAS KIND OF A COLLABORATORY THING BUT THEY HAD CHARM SCHOOLS FOR US 
CHARM SCHOOLS THEY TAUGHT US HOW TO SIT WITH JOOLS 
AND WE WERE TOLD WE'D BE SINGING BEFORE KINGS AND QUEENS 
AND WE DID A COMMAND PERFORMANCE IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
IN FACT THE GOWN THAT WE WORE AT THE PALLADIUM IS ON EXHIBIT THERE 
WE MET THE QUEEN MOTHER SHE WAS A DOLL TOO 
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THE GOWN THAT WE WORE 
THERE WERE THREE SUPREMES DIANA ROSS FLORENCE BALLARD AND MYSELF 
YOU ALL HAD THE SAME GOWN IDENTICAL 
IN THE BEGINNING THEN IT KIND OF CHANGED AND DIANA WOULD GET A DIFFERENT COLOUR 
IN THE EXHIBIT THERE IS ONLY ONE GOWN 
THEY'RE FORTY SOMETHING YEARS OLD SO SOME OF THEM HAVE NOT HELD UP 
LET'S HAVE A LITTLE LOOK BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER 
WE'VE GOT A CLIP OF THE SUPREMES STOPPING IN THE NAME OF LOVE 
THIS TIME BEFORE YOU RUN TO HER 
LEAVING ME ALONE AND HURT 
THINK IT O. OVER 
AFTER I'VE BEEN GOOD TO YOU 
THINK IT O. OVER 
AFTER I'VE BEEN SWEET TO YOU 
STOP IN THE NAME OF LOVE 
BEFORE YOU BREAK MY HEART 
STOP IN THE NAME OF LOVE 
BEFORE YOU BREAK MY HEART 
THINK IT O. OVER 
THINK IT O. OVER 
WHAT SHOW WAS THAT IT'S YOU IN THE MIDDLE I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT SURE 
I USED TO WATCH THINGS LIKE THAT AND I WANTED TO HANG OUT WITH THEM 
YOU ARE IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE WE'RE SITTING TOGETHER 
I'D LOOK AT THAT AND THINK YOU MUST BE ON TOUR SEEING ALL THE WORLD 
MUST HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY IT WAS GREAT 
WAS IT AS GREAT AS I IMAGINED IT WAS IT WAS GREAT ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES WE VISITED WAS GREAT BRITAIN 
IN FACT BABY LOVE WAS NUMBER ONE HERE FIRST 
AND WE WERE EMBRACED SO WELL BY THE ENGLISH PEOPLE IT WAS FABULOUS 
NOW THIS IS ON EXHIBIT THIS IS THE SORT OF THING I WOULD LOVE 
THERE'S YOU IN THE MIDDLE DID YOU ALWAYS STAND IN THE MIDDLE 
UNTIL THEY FOUND OUT THAT WAS THE BEST SPOT THEN I WAS MOVED OUT 
WHY WAS THE MIDDLE THE BEST SPOT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I WAS OH I SEE 
YES INDEED 
WE HAVE A LOT OF MEMORABILIA WE HAVE EIGHT TRACKS 
THESE PEOPLE MIGHT BE TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER EIGHT TRACKS 
WE HAVE GOWNS EYELASHES WIGS ALL KINDS OF THINGS ON EXHIBIT 
IT'S THE EXHIBIT THAT SHOWS YOU THE SOCIAL RELEVANCE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE WORLD 
AND I SUPPOSE MOTOWN WAS THE FIRST MAINSTREAM POPULAR BLACK THING TO HIT A BIG WHITE AUDIENCE 
YES IT WAS MR. BERRY GORDY THE OWNER OF MOTOWN WANTED TO MAKE MUSIC SO THAT EVERYBODY COULD EMBRACE IT 
IT WAS SOUL MUSIC BUT SOMETIMES IT WASN'T PLAYED BY EVERYONE BECAUSE IT WAS JUST SOUL 
SO HE SORT OF MADE THAT MOTOWN SOUND SO THAT EVERYONE COULD ENJOY THE MUSIC 
SOME OF THE GREATEST RECORDS OF ALL TIME THANK YOU FOR PLAYING THOSE SUPREMES RECORDS 
AND A FANTASTIC THERE'S NO BREAD IN THERE JOOLS YOU CAN'T EAT IT 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD I'M GOING TO BE AT THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM

FROM NORTH CAROLINA WE WELCOME CHATHAM COUNTY LINE 
WE MET ON THE CAROLINIAN 
HEADING SOUTH FROM D. C. 
IT'S AS IF GOD HIMSELF 
HAD PICKED OUT OUR SEATS 
SHE SMILED AND SAID RICHMOND 
WHEN I ASKED WHERE SHE WAS BOUND 
I BEGAN TO WISH MY LIFE AWAY 
TO HAVE BEEN BORN IN THAT TOWN 
WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT AND THEN SHE SMILED 
AND I SAW THEN IN HER EYES 
SHE WASN'T JUST BEAUTIFUL 
SHE WAS KIND AND SHE WAS WISE 
BUT A WOMAN DOWN IN RALEIGH 
WOULD SOON HAVE MY SON 
SO I WAITED FOR HER STATION 
LIKE THE BULLET FROM A GUN 
SHE'S IN RICHMOND WITH MY HEART 
AND I'M BOUND FOR CAROLINA 
WISH I'D NEVER MET THIS TRAIN 
OR THE GIRL IT'S LEFT BEHIND HER 
WHEN THE TRAIN REACHED THE STATION 
SHE LOOKED ME IN THE EYE 
SAID COME WITH ME TO RICHMOND AND WE'LL START A BRAND NEW LIFE 
WELL YOU KNOW THAT MOMENT 
STILL WEIGHS ON MY MIND 
COS I TOOK MY BODY TO RALEIGH 
AND LEFT MY HEART BEHIND 
SHE'S IN RICHMOND WITH MY HEART 
AND I'M BOUND FOR CAROLINA 
WISH I'D NEVER MET THIS TRAIN 
OR THE GIRL THAT'S LEFT BEHIND HER 
NOW WE'RE APART 
SO WHILE I'M BOUND FOR CAROLINA 
SHE'S IN RICHMOND WITH MY HEART 
MY SON IS GROWN UP TO MY HAND

ONE MICROPHONE MULTI TALENT 
CHATHAM COUNTY LINE 
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO CHATHAM IN KENT 
NO YOU MUST VISIT CHATHAM IN KENT THEY LOVE YOU THERE 
NOW WE WELCOME AN EXTRAORDINARY MUSIC LEGEND 
WHO HAS DONE A RECORD WHICH IS A TRIBUTE TO A GREAT BLUESMAN 
WE WELCOME MICK HUCKNALL 
HI JOOLS NICE TO SEE YOU 
NOW 
UM I THINK THE FIRST THING IS YOU'VE RELEASED THIS RECORD 
IT'S THE FIRST SOLO RECORD SINCE SIMPLY RED YEAH 
AND ER 
TELL US ABOUT WHO IT'S A TRIBUTE TO 
IT'S A TRIBUTE TO A SINGER CALLED BOBBY BLUE BLAND 
WHO WAS NOT VERY WELL KNOWN 
UM PARTLY BECAUSE OF MARY AND THE SUPREMES 
IN A WAY BECAUSE 
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT 
THEY KIND OF CHANGED THE WORLD BY BRINGING SORT OF MOTOWN INTO POP 
AND BOBBY WAS REALLY LIKE AN R. AND AMP B. GOSPEL SINGER 
AND HE KIND OF WAS A LITTLE BIT BEFORE THEM 
AND SOMEHOW THAT WHOLE THING JUST CHANGED THE WORLD 
AND OVERSHADOWED THAT WHOLE SCENE 
WHICH IS IN A WAY SORT OF GOOD NEWS FOR ME 
BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH HIS WORK 
AND ER THE SONGS THAT HE CHOSE FOR ME HAVE LIVED WITH ME 
SINCE I WAS ABOUT NINETEEN 
AND I THINK THE SONGS ARE BRILLIANT 
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I CHOSE TO DO THIS 
TO EXPOSE THESE SONGS 
I REMEMBER HEARING HIM DOING A RECORD WITH DOUBLE B. KING 
AND THEN HEARING THAT RECORD WITH ALONE AFTER MIDNIGHT ON IT 
AND IT MADE ME SHAKE YEAH 
HE USED TO TOUR A LOT WITH DOUBLE B. KING 
I FIRST HEARD HIM IN LIVERPOOL IN A CLUB CALLED ERIC'S 
IN ABOUT NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT 
AND DID YOU MEET HIM AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT DOING THIS YEAH 
I FLEW OVER TO MEMPHIS 
AND WE MET 
AND I'VE GOT TO SAY I WAS A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS 
BECAUSE IT'S A STRANGE SITUATION GOING IN AND SAYING HI 
HERE'S SOME OF YOUR SONGS DONE BY ME 
COS WE DIDN'T DO DIRECT COPIES OF WHAT HE DID YEAH 
WE TRIED TO REMEMBER THAT IT WAS TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AT THAT TIME 
AND WE'RE NOW SO WE'RE NOT IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE 
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS TO SHINE 
YOU KNOW SO PEOPLE CAN DISCOVER BOBBY BLUE BLAND 
WHICH IS A GREAT THING 
AND UM WILL SIMPLY RED DO MORE AFTER THIS DO YOU THINK ER 
WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE MORE TOUR IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TWO THOUSAND TEN 
AS A THANK YOU FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF PLEASURE 
AND THEN I WANT TO MOVE ON 
AND ER JUST BECOME MORE TRY AND USE MY WRITING NOW 
TO BECOME MORE INFLUENCED BY THIS PERIOD 
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY UNTAPPED AS AN INFLUENCE
