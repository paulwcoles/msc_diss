WHO ARE YOU WHAT DO YOU WANT 
DON'T BE AFRAID WHAT DO YOU WANT 
BUT THEY SAID YOU WERE 
BUT THEY CALLED YOU 
BUT YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE PERFECT 
I TRIED TO SPEAK TO YOU IN THE FOREST YESTERDAY BUT I FRIGHTENED YOU I'M SORRY 
I WAS FRIGHTENED I WAS TERRIFIED 
YES I WAS VERY CLUMSY 
I HAVE COME NOW TO MAKE CERTAIN YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THE DRUGS I LEFT FOR YOU YOU LEFT 
WE THOUGHT THEY'D BEEN DROPPED BY ACCIDENT NO WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY WERE DRUGS 
YOU MEAN YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN THEM YET BUT YOU MUST 
THAT'S WHY I CAME BACK YOU SEE 
MY GRANDFATHER AND TWO OF MY FRIENDS ARE PRISONERS IN THE CITY AND 
NO PLEASE PLEASE YOU'RE TOO QUICK FOR ME 
THERE ARE FOUR OF YOU I KNOW THAT I'VE WATCHED YOU 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN PRISONERS 
WELL DON'T YOU KNOW ABOUT THE DALEKS 
SO THE DALEK PEOPLE HAVE SURVIVED 
BUT DO THEY LIVE IN THAT DEAD CITY 
WELL UNDERNEATH IT ANYWAY 
YOU SEE THE DALEKS WANT THE DRUGS TOO AND THEY WON'T LET US GO UNTIL I BRING THEM BACK TO THEM 
BUT WHY SHOULD THEY WANT THE DRUGS SURELY THEY MUST HAVE SOME THEMSELVES IF THEY'RE STILL ALIVE 
I DON'T KNOW 
LOOK MY GRANDFATHER AND MY FRIENDS ARE TERRIBLY ILL AND I MUST TAKE THE DRUG BACK TO THEM 
NO NO WAIT 
ARE YOU SURE THE DALEKS WANT THE DRUGS FOR YOUR FRIENDS AND NOT FOR THEMSELVES 
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT 
DO YOU TRUST THEM NO 
WELL I'M NOT SURE 
YOU STILL HAVE THE DRUGS I LEFT FOR YOU 
I SHALL GIVE YOU A FURTHER SUPPLY WHICH YOU MUST HIDE AS BEST YOU CAN 
DO YOU TRUST ME 
YES 
I AM ALYDON OF THE THAL RACE 
I SHALL GO WITH YOU THROUGH THE FOREST TO THE OUTER WALL OF THE CITY IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME 
THANK YOU 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
THEY SAID YOU WERE 
WELL THEY CALLED YOU MUTATIONS 
HERE TAKE MY CLOAK YOU'RE COLD THANK YOU 
WE ARE THE SURVIVORS OF THE FINAL WAR 
BUT THE RADIATION STILL PERSISTS AND THAT IS WHY YOUR FRIENDS ARE ILL 
I WONDER IF THE DALEKS HAVE SEEN US 
SEEN YOU I MEAN IF THEY CALL US MUTATIONS 
WHAT MUST THEY BE LIKE 
I HAVE RETURNED THE GIRL TO THE CELL 
VERY WELL THEY ARE ASKING FOR WATER 
GIVE THEM SOME 
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GIRL MUST HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH THE THALS 
OUR PRISONERS COULD BRING THE THALS TO US 
PRECISELY THAT 
THE THALS SAID THE DRUG WOULD ACT QUICKLY 
DON'T GIVE HIM ANY MORE WATER SUSAN 
HIS PULSE IS STEADY NOW ANYWAY 
MY ARMS ARE TINGLING 
YES ALYDON SAID YOU'D FEEL THAT 
IT JUST MEANS THAT THE DRUG'S WORKING THAT'S ALL 
THIS ALYDON SEEMS TO HAVE KEPT HIS WITS ABOUT HIM GIVING YOU THAT EXTRA SUPPLY OF DRUGS 
YES IT WAS STRANGE WHEN THE DALEKS FOUND IT 
I THOUGHT FIRST OF ALL THEY WERE GOING TO KEEP BOTH LOTS THEN THEY 
SUDDENLY SEEMED TO CHANGE THEIR MIND AND GAVE THE SECOND LOT BACK TO ME 
YES STILL THE THALS SEEM MORE FRIENDLY 
OH YES 
ALYDON GAVE ME THIS CLOAK TO KEEP ME WARM 
WHY DO THE DALEKS THINK THEY'RE MUTATIONS I DON'T KNOW 
JUDGING BY ALYDON THEY'RE MAGNIFICENT PEOPLE 
SUSAN 
GRANDFATHER 
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER SOON I'VE BROUGHT THE DRUGS BACK 
OH GIVE ME A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN WE MUST GO BACK TO THE SHIP 
WE'RE STILL PRISONERS 
OH ARE WE 
AS SOON AS GRANDFATHER'S PROPERLY AWAKE WE MUST TRY AND FIND A WAY OF HELPING THE THALS 
WE CAN'T EVEN HELP OURSELVES LOCKED UP IN HERE LIKE THIS 
WE MUST TRY AND TALK TO THE DALEKS 
ALYDON SAYS THE THALS ARE GOING TO STARVE UNLESS THEY CAN FIND NEW SUPPLIES OF FOOD 
YOU SEE 
AFTER THE WAR THE THALS THAT SURVIVED MANAGED TO CULTIVATE SMALL PLOTS OF LAND 
WELL THAT'S HOW THEY'VE SURVIVED EVER SINCE BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS HAD 
TO BE VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE THE CROPS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN DANGER 
BUT THEY RELY ON A GREAT RAINFALL THAT ONLY HAPPENS ABOUT EVERY FOUR OR FIVE YEARS 
WELL IT'S TWO YEARS OVERDUE NOW AND ALL THEIR CROPS ARE RUINED 
THAT'S WHY THE WHOLE THAL RACE HAD TO LEAVE THEIR PLATEAU AND GO IN SEARCH OF FOOD 
ALYDON SAYS THAT UNLESS WE CAN HELP THEM ARRANGE SOME SORT OF TREATY WITH THE DALEKS 
THEY'RE ALL GOING TO DIE 
BUT HOW CAN WE SUSAN 
WELL HE WANTS TO TALK TO THE DALEKS 
HE SAID IF THEY BRING A SUPPLY OF FOOD FOR THEM THEN ONE OF US MUST TAKE A MESSAGE OUTSIDE THE CITY 
WE COULD LET THIS CATASTROPHE DESTROY THE THALS 
WILL THEY LET THEMSELVES STARVE TO DEATH 
NO I FEEL PRESERVING OUR PRISONERS WAS A GOOD IDEA 
AND AN ARRANGEMENT TO BRING THE THALS INSIDE OUR CITY AN EVEN BETTER ONE 
WE'LL LET OUR PRISONERS SLEEP AND THEN GIVE THEM FOOD 
AFTER THAT WE CAN PLAN 
WHY NOT BEGIN NOW 
BECAUSE THE LAPSE OF TIME THE RELAXATION OF SLEEP THE PROVISION OF FOOD 
ALL THESE THINGS WILL GIVE THEM A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY 
WE HAVE BROUGHT YOU FOOD AND MORE WATER 
THE GIRL IS TO COME WITH ME 
WHY IT'S ALL RIGHT WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO TO HER 
SHE WILL BE RETURNED WE ARE GOING TO HELP THE THALS WHICH IS YOU WANT US TO DO 
COME NOW 
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HAVE THEY TAKEN SUSAN 
HOW DO THEY KNOW WE WANT TO HELP THE THALS 
AH GANATUS 
ALYDON YOU HAVE BEEN LONGER THAN I THOUGHT 
THE PATH WAS ROUGH THE DEAD CITY LIES OVER THERE 
LET US IN HERE WE'LL WALK THE REST 
OH WHAT IS IT TEMMOSUS 
THIS MUST BE THE CRAFT IN WHICH THE STRANGERS ARRIVED HERE 
SO ALYDON WE WERE RIGHT TO BELIEVE THE CITY INHABITED 
YES TEMMOSUS 
I WONDER WHAT THEY'LL BE LIKE HOW THEY'LL BE DISPOSED TOWARDS US THEY ARE DALEKS 
YES BUT WE'VE CHANGED OVER THE CENTURIES WHY SHOULDN'T THEY 
THE ONCE FAMOUS WARRIOR RACE OF THALS 
ARE NOW FARMERS 
BUT THE DALEKS WILL TEACH US WON'T THEY TEMMOSUS YES THEY WERE AND PHILOSOPHERS 
PERHAPS THEY ARE THE WARRIORS NOW 
FROM A DISTANCE THE CITY LOOKS AS IF THEY MAKE SCIENCE AND INVENTION THEIR PROFESSION 
IT'S A MAGICAL ARCHITECTURE 
PERHAPS WE CAN EXCHANGE IDEAS WITH THEM LEARN FROM THEM 
PERHAPS 
AND THESE OTHERS THEY ARRIVED HERE IN THIS WEIRD OBJECT 
YES TEMMOSUS AND YOU TRUST THEM ALYDON 
I HAVE ONLY SPOKEN WITH THE YOUNG GIRL 
BUT IF THE OTHERS ARE ANYTHING LIKE HER I WOULD TRUST THEM ABSOLUTELY 
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT TOO GENEROUS IN YOUR BELIEFS 
WHAT DO YOU SAY DYONI HMM 
I HAVE NO OPINIONS IN THE MATTER 
HOW UNUSUAL 
WHERE IS THE GIRL NOW 
I HAVE GIVEN HER THE DRUGS AND SHE HAS RETURNED TO THE CITY 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF YOU'D GIVEN IT TO A MAN 
I HAD NO CHANCE THEY ARE PRISONERS IN THE CITY PRISONERS 
ARE YOU SURE I'M AFRAID SO 
FROM EVERYTHING THE YOUNG GIRL SAID THE DALEKS ARE CERTAINLY VERY SUSPICIOUS OF OTHERS 
TELL ME ALYDON HOW OLD IS THIS YOUNG GIRL 
NO LONGER A CHILD NOT YET A WOMAN 
AH THEN PERHAPS IT'S SAFE FOR YOU TO TALK TO HER IF SHE'S NOT YET A WOMAN 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HER IF WE DON'T FIND A NEW FOOD SUPPLY FOR NEXT YEAR WE'RE FINISHED 
DOESN'T SHE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME END 
NOW THERE'S A DOUBLE MEANING FOR YOU 
BUT DON'T YOU REALISE THAT DYONI SEES HER PERSONAL FUTURE IN YOU 
YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE LEFT OUR PLATEAU AND STARTED ON THIS JOURNEY 
SHE WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A CHILD 
BUT THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO 
I'M NOT QUITE SO BLIND 
WELL GO ON WHAT HAVE YOU PLANNED 
THE YOUNG GIRL WILL SPEAK WITH THE DALEKS AND A MESSAGE WILL COME FROM THE CITY 
DIRECT FROM THE GIRL YES 
BUT HOW SHALL WE KNOW THAT IT IS NOT A TRICK SHE TOLD ME HER NAME 
SUSAN AND THAT IS HOW THE MESSAGE IS TO BE SIGNED 
OTHERWISE WE SHALL KNOW THE DALEKS ARE HOSTILE TO US 
OUR LIQUID FOOD'S LOCKED UP IN ABUNDANCE WE CAN ALSO SUPPLY 
UNLIMITED QUANTITIES OF FRESH VEGETABLES 
WHICH ARE FORCED IN ARTIFICIAL SUNLIGHT 
JUST A MINUTE 
A. R. TI FI C. I. AL 
SUN LIGHT ALL RIGHT GO ON 
IF RETURNED 
WE SHALL EXPECT THE THALS TO HELP US 
IN THE RECULTIVATION OF THE LAND SURROUNDING THE C. I. 
WHY HAVE YOU STOPPED WRITING 
WELL I CAN ONLY ASK THEM I CAN'T ACCEPT FOR THEM 
THEN PUT DOWN THAT WE EXPECT THEM TO HELP US 
YES I'M SURE THEY WILL 
PLEASE SIT STILL WHILE WE EXAMINE WHAT YOU'VE WRITTEN 
WHAT IS THE LAST WORD HERE 
THE LAST WORD 
SU SAN 
STOP THAT NOISE 
WELL IT'S WHAT I'M CALLED 
IT'S MY NAME 
SUSAN AND YOU TOLD THE THALS THAT YOU WOULD WRITE THIS NAME 
ON THE MESSAGE YES 
LOOK THERE'S NO NEED TO BE FRIGHTENED OF THEM 
THEY'RE VERY FRIENDLY PEOPLE AND ALL THEY WANT IS FOOD 
LET ME TAKE THE MESSAGE TO THEM 
NO WHY NOT WE HAVE PLANNED OTHERWISE 
BUT HOW LONG ARE THEY GOING TO KEEP SUSAN DOCTOR 
WHAT DO THEY WANT WITH HER 
PERHAPS THEY'RE GOING TO LET US GO I DON'T KNOW 
WE KNEW YOU COULD HEAR US BECAUSE YOU KNEW ABOUT THE THALS AND THE FOOD IT DOES NOT MATTER 
WE HAVE THE MESSAGE NOW 
ALL SET DOCTOR 
THE WHOLE PATTERN OF THINGS IS SUSPICIOUS 
JUST BECAUSE THE DALEKS DIDN'T KILL US IS NO REASON TO TRUST THEM 
OR SUSPECT THEM EITHER WELL MAYBE THEY JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING THINGS 
THE THALS HAVE HELPED US THE DALEKS PUT US IN A CELL I KNOW WHICH OF THE TWO I'D PREFER 
I TELL YOU THE DALEKS ARE BRILLIANT PEOPLE I THINK WE OUGHT TO CO OPERATE WITH THEM 
EVER SINCE YOU'VE TALKED ALONE TO THE DALEKS YOU'VE BEEN ON THEIR SIDE WHAT HAVE THEY DONE 
BRIBED YOU OR SOMETHING 
LOOK I WANT TO KNOW WHY 
WHY ARE YOU ON THEIR SIDE AND AGAINST THE REST OF US 
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME HOW DARE YOU SIR 
I WANT AN ANSWER 
LEAVE HIM ALONE 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
DID I HURT YOU NO DON'T WASTE TIME 
FIXED YOU FOR A WHILE 
DO YOU THINK IT WAS BROKEN ACCIDENTALLY IN THEIR STRUGGLE 
NO THE CABLE IS STRONG THEY HAVE BROKEN IT DELIBERATELY 
THEY CAN BE MOVED IMMEDIATELY TO ANOTHER ROOM WITH MY REPAIR 
NO EXTERMINATION THEN 
THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM THE ROOM THAT HOLDS THEM 
THEY MAY WELL BE USEFUL AGAIN 
WE SHALL DEAL WITH THE THALS 
THE POINT IS HOW DO WE GET OUT OF HERE 
WAIT UNTIL THE DALEKS OPEN THE DOOR AND FORCE THE ISSUE 
WE'D NEVER GET NEAR THEM WE MUST TRY AND TRICK THEM 
WE MUST ALL PRETEND TO BE DEAD THEN WHEN THEY COME IN TO INVESTIGATE WE MUST RUSH DOWN THE CORRIDOR 
YES AND THEN WHAT 
NO WE MUST FIND A WAY OF PUTTING THESE MACHINES OUT OF ACTION 
YES REMEMBER WHAT THEY DID TO YOUR LEGS YES 
THE FLOORS ARE METAL 
ALL THE FLOORS ARE METAL WELL SO ARE THE STREETS OF THE CITY OUTSIDE 
WHY I DON'T KNOW 
NO I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW 
I MEAN WHY DO THEY USE METAL 
IS IT BECAUSE THAT IT LASTS LONGER OR BECAUSE IT'S ESSENTIAL TO THEM THAT'S AN IDEA 
WELL HOW IS THAT GOING TO HELP US WELL IF METAL IS A. 
NO NO NOW LISTEN LET'S CONCENTRATE ON THE DALEKS 
HAVE YOU NOTICED FOR EXAMPLE THAT WHEN THEY MOVE ABOUT THERE'S A SORT OF ACRID SMELL 
YES I'VE NOTICED THAT I KNOW 
A FAIRGROUND 
THAT'S IT DODGEMS IT'S ELECTRICITY 
I THINK THEY'RE POWERED THAT WAY YES JUST A MINUTE 
THEY HAVE NO PICK UP OR ANYTHING 
AND ONLY THE BASE OF THE MACHINE TOUCHES THE FLOOR 
HOW DO THEY COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT 
BATTERIES NO NO I BELIEVE THE DALEKS HAVE DISCOVERED A WAY TO EXPLOIT STATIC ELECTRICITY 
VERY INGENIOUS IF I'M RIGHT 
WHAT DRAWING POWER FROM THE FLOOR 
PRECISELY IF I'M RIGHT OF COURSE 
NOW WHAT DO WE KNOW APART FROM GUESSING HOW THEY ARE POWERED M. M. M. 
THEY CAN SEE ALL ROUND THEM YES 
THEIR EYE IS FLEXIBLE LIKE A LARGE CAMERA LENS 
YES YES NOW CHESTERTON DO YOU MIND CONCENTRATING YOUNG MAN MM 
SUSAN H. M. M. THE CLOAK THE THALS GAVE YOU 
YES IT'S JUST BEHIND YOU AH BARBARA COME HERE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS MADE OF OH I DON'T KNOW IT ISN'T PLASTIC OR 
I DON'T THINK IT'S NYLON EITHER 
WHATEVER IT IS IT'LL DO FOR WHAT WE WANT 
AND WHAT WILL IT DO YOUNG MAN H. M. M. 
INSULATE IF YOU'RE RIGHT DOCTOR ABOUT THE DALEKS TAKING UP POWER 
FROM THE FLOOR THIS IS A PERFECT WAY OF PUTTING THEM OUT OF ACTION 
LOOK GANATUS THEY'VE FOUND A MANGADON UNDER SOME BUSHES 
DEAD I HOPE WELL OF COURSE IT'S DEAD 
OH I NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE SERIOUS AND WHEN YOU'RE JOKING 
WE'LL BE ABLE TO RECHARGE THE HANDLIGHTS 
I'LL GO AND TELL ANTODUS 
IS HE STILL AFRAID OF THE DARK 
WHAT I'M SORRY MY BROTHER ISN'T AFRAID OF ANYTHING 
TEMMOSUS SUPPOSE THE DALEKS REFUSE TO HELP US WHAT THEN 
I BELIEVE THE DALEKS HOLD THE KEY TO OUR FUTURE 
WHATEVER THAT FUTURE MAY BE WE MUST ACCEPT IT GRACEFULLY AND WITHOUT REGRET 
I WISH I COULD BE AS OBJECTIVE AS YOU 
WE'VE LIVED FOR SO LONG A TIME 
PERHAPS WE HAVE LIVED TOO LONG 
I'VE NEVER STRUGGLED AGAINST THE INEVITABLE 
IT'S A VAIN OCCUPATION BUT I SHOULD ALWAYS ADVISE YOU 
TO EXAMINE VERY CLOSELY WHAT YOU THINK TO BE INEVITABLE 
IT'S SURPRISING HOW OFTEN APPARENT DEFEAT CAN BE TURNED TO VICTORY 
THIS WAS FOUND AT THE CITY GATES 
WHAT DOES IT SAY 
THEY'RE COMING TO HELP US 
IT'S SIGNED BY THE GIRL SUSAN 
SHE SAYS THE DALEK PEOPLE HAVE NO MALICE TOWARDS US AND 
THEY HOPE THAT THEY CAN WORK WITH US TO BUILD A NEW AND SAFE WORLD FREE FROM THE FEAR OF WAR 
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE FOOD BY MEANS OF SYNTHETIC SUNLIGHT 
AND THEY HAVE LEFT A QUANTITY OF IT FOR US IN THE ENTRANCE HALL OF THEIR MAIN BUILDING 
WE ARE TO COLLECT IT TOMORROW 
SO THERE IS A FUTURE FOR US
