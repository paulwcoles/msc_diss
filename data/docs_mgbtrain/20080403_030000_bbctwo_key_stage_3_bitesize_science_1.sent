HELLO AND WELCOME TO KEY STAGE THREE BITESIZE 
YOU'RE WATCHING THE FIRST OF THREE PROGRAMMES DESIGNED TO HELP YOU REVISE FOR YOUR SCIENCE S. A. T. TEST 
GET READY FOR SOME GREAT CLIPS REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND MEMORY BUILDING BULLET POINTS 
THESE PROGRAMMES COVER MOST OF THE UNITS THAT YOU NEED TO REVISE 
AT THE START OF EACH UNIT YOU'LL SEE A MAIN MENU 
TO HELP YOU KEEP TRACK OF WHERE YOU ARE AND HELP YOU FIND WHAT YOU NEED TO REVISE 
EACH SECTION HAS A REFERENCE NUMBER THAT CAN BE SEEN ON SCREEN AS YOU FAST FORWARD THROUGH THE PROGRAMME 
THERE ARE ALSO KEY POINTS AND EXAMPLE QUESTIONS IN EACH UNIT SO KEEP A PEN AND PAPER HANDY 
ON THE WAY THROUGH YOU CAN PAUSE STOP FAST FORWARD OR REWIND 
SO IF YOU'RE NOT CLEAR ABOUT ANYTHING YOU CAN WATCH IT AGAIN 
HOWEVER YOU PLAN YOUR TIME IT'S USEFUL TO LEARN IN BITESIZE CHUNKS OF TWENTY MINUTES IT'S YOUR CALL 
YOU CAN DESIGN YOUR OWN WAY OF REVISING WHEN YOU WANT TO 
LET'S GET STARTED 
THE TWO SCIENCE PAPERS YOU'LL BE TAKING ARE BOTH ONE HOUR LONG AND ARE ON THE SAME DAY 
THEY COVER ALL OF YOUR WORK FROM YEAR SEVEN SO GO OVER YOUR NOTES 
MADE ONE AND TWO YEARS AGO AS WELL AS YOUR RECENT WORK 
THE FIRST TWO BITESIZE PROGRAMMES COVER THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW FROM LEVEL FOUR TO SIX 
PROGRAMME THREE DEALS WITH THE SCIENCE YOU'LL NEED TO GET A LEVEL SEVEN 
BUT WHERE ON EARTH DO YOU START 
WELL REVISING IS A SKILL THAT YOU NEED TO LEARN 
AND IF YOU START AS SOON AS YOU CAN IT'LL MAKE REVISING FOR THE EXAMS AHEAD OF YOU A WHOLE LOT EASIER 
FIRST YOU HAVE TO GET ORGANISED 
IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO START REVISING EARLY 
SO YOU CAN ASK YOUR TEACHER IF THERE IS ANYTHING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND 
FOR YOUR REVISION JUST READING IS A GOOD THING 
BUT IT'S BETTER TO DO MORE ACTIVE REVISION 
YOU COULD MAKE MIND MAPS NOTES OR DRAW A SERIES OF PICTURES TO HELP YOU REMEMBER THINGS 
TO GET YOU PREPARED FOR YOUR S. A. T.'S REVISION 
PLAN OUT A TIMETABLE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TONS OF WORK IN THE LAST WEEK 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME KEY POINTS ABOUT REVISING 
IT'S IMPORTANT YOU GET YOUR PREPARATION RIGHT 
IN THIS UNIT WE'LL LOOK AT LIFE PROCESSES ANIMAL AND PLANT CELLS 
IN THE FINAL SECTION WE'LL LOOK AT MORE SPECIALISED CELLS 
LET'S START WITH THE SEVEN LIFE PROCESSES 
SEVEN LIFE PROCESSES KEEP US ALIVE 
THE MOST OBVIOUS ONES ARE RESPIRATION MOVEMENT AND NUTRITION 
LET'S JUST RUN THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST AS A REMINDER YOU MIGHT LIKE TO WRITE THEM DOWN AS WE GO THROUGH 
MOVEMENT WHERE MUSCLES CONTRACT AND RELAX AS PARTS OF THE BODY MOVE 
REPRODUCTION ALL LIVING THINGS NEED TO PRODUCE YOUNG 
SENSITIVITY ALL LIVING THINGS CAN DETECT CHANGES AND CAN RESPOND TO MOST OF THESE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE 
GROWTH ORGANISMS THAT ARE BORN SMALL NEED TO GROW INTO ADULT SIZE 
PARTICULARLY WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL IS YOUNG 
RESPIRATION IS A PROCESS BY WHICH ENERGY AND FOOD IS RELEASED IN CELLS 
EXCRETION WASTE PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY THE BODY AND ITS CELLS NEED TO BE REMOVED 
AND FINALLY NUTRITION FOOD IS NEEDED FOR NEW BODY STRUCTURES ENERGY GROWTH AND REPAIR 
SO THAT WAS ALL SEVEN LIFE PROCESSES AND THERE IS AN EASY WAY OF REMEMBERING THEM 
AN EASY WAY TO REMEMBER THE SEVEN CHARACTERISTICS OF LIFE IS MRS. GREN 
ALL SEVEN OF THESE LIFE PROCESSES ALSO APPLY TO PLANTS INCLUDING MOVING AND SENSING 
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK 
THIS IS A RADISH IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO DO OR RESPOND TO ANYTHING 
THIS RADISH HAS BEEN REACTING TO THE STIMULUS OF LIGHT 
IN GROWING IT WEAVED TOWARDS THAT STIMULUS OVER FOUR DAYS 
MANY PLANTS RESPOND LIKE THIS BUT IT HAPPENS SO SLOWLY YOU DON'T NOTICE 
REMEMBER PLANTS ALSO HAVE MOVEMENT 
FOR EXAMPLE PLANTS WILL MOVE TOWARDS THE LIGHT 
AND SENSITIVITY PLANTS WILL DETECT CHANGES AND RESPOND TO THEM 
IT MOVES IT NEEDS FOOD 
IT EXCRETES AND IT COULD BE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES 
SO IS IT LIVING WHY NOT HAVE A THINK 
A CAR IS NOT A LIVING THING BECAUSE 
THE MARKS YOU CAN GET ARE WRITTEN ON THE PAPER 
FOR THIS ANSWER ONE MARK IS GIVEN 
ALL LIVING THINGS ARE MADE OF CELLS THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF LIFE WE ARE MADE UP OF ONE HUNDRED BILLION OF THEM 
SOME CELLS LIKE THE ONES IN THIS RED ONION FOR EXAMPLE CAN BE SEEN UNDER AN ORDINARY MICROSCOPE 
TO FIND THE RIGHT LAYER YOU NEED TO CUT A FEW CENTIMETRES INTO THE ONION 
AND IF YOU LOOK AT ONE OF THESE INNER LAYERS ON ABOUT FIFTY TIMES MAGNIFICATION YOU CAN SEE THE CELLS 
BUT CAN WE SEE ANY OF OUR OWN CELLS 
NOW I MUST DO THIS RIGHT 
COTTON BUDS 
ON THIS COTTON BUD I'VE GOT SOME OF MY CHEEK CELLS 
I'M GONNA USE SOME OF THIS BLUE STAIN BECAUSE IT HELPS SHOW UP THE CELLS 
AND THEN PUT ON THE COVER SLIP 
THERE 
AND AT A THOUSAND TIMES MAGNIFICATION YOU CAN SEE THE INDIVIDUAL CELLS 
MOST CELLS ARE SMALLER THAN THESE 
THE AVERAGE CELL IS ONE THIRTIETH OF A MILLIMETRE 
WHICH MEANS IF THIS BRICK IS THE SIZE OF ONE CELL 
THEN THIS MANY THIRTY CAN FIT INTO THIS SPACE 
SO A DIAGRAM OF AN ANIMAL CELL WILL LOOK LIKE THIS 
YOU NEED TO LABEL THE CELL MEMBRANE WHICH CONTROLS THE MOVEMENT OF SUBSTANCES INTO AND OUT OF THE CELL 
A JELLY LIKE SUBSTANCE CALLED THE CYTOPLASM IS WHERE ALL THE CELL'S REACTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT 
THE NUCLEUS CONTAINS THE D. N. A. AND CONTROLS ALL THE CELL'S ACTIVITIES 
PLANT CELLS ALSO HAVE THESE THREE STRUCTURES BUT THEY HAVE OTHERS AS WELL 
O. K. NOW WE'VE GOT THE CELL HERE MAGNIFIED OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND TIMES 
AND HERE WE CAN SEE THAT THIS CELL IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM AN ANIMAL CELL 
IN THAT IT'S GOT THIS CELL WALL ON THE OUTSIDE ALL THE WAY ROUND THE CELL 
APART FROM A PLANT CELL'S OUTER WALL THE ALGAE CELL IS VERY SIMILAR TO ALL CELLS 
THERE'S THE PROTECTIVE MEMBRANE AROUND THE CELL THE NUCLEUS 
LIKE THE NERVE CENTRE CONTROLLING EVERYTHING IN THE CELL 
AND THE CYTOPLASM WHERE CHEMICALS AND FOOD ARE MADE 
IN COMMON WITH AN ANIMAL CELL THE PLANT CELL ALSO HAS A NUCLEUS 
CYTOPLASM AND A CELL MEMBRANE 
IN ADDITION TO THESE THREE THE PLANT CELL HAS A CELL WALL 
MADE UP OF CELLULOSE WHICH GIVES IT SHAPE AND STRUCTURE AND PROVIDES THE FIBRE IN OUR DIET 
INSIDE THE PLANT CELL IS A LARGE VACUOLE FULL OF SAP 
GREEN PLANT CELLS IN THE LEAVES WILL ALSO CONTAIN CHLOROPLASTS 
CHLOROPLASTS HOLD THE GREEN PIGMENT CHLOROPHYLL 
USED TO ABSORB LIGHT FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
GET EVERYTHING READY THE NIGHT BEFOREHAND 
SO YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT ON THE DAY OF THE EXAM 
YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT ALL PLANT AND ANIMAL CELLS HAVE THREE THINGS IN COMMON 
PLANT CELLS ALSO HAVE THREE STRUCTURES THAT ANIMAL CELLS DON'T HAVE A CELL WALL A VACUOLE 
AND CHLOROPLASTS IF THE CELLS ARE GREEN SO LEAVES BUT NOT ROOTS 
FOR YOUR TEST YOU'LL NEED TO BE SURE OF THE STRUCTURES OF PLANT AND ANIMAL CELLS 
AND WHICH PARTS ONLY APPEAR IN PLANT CELLS 
WHY NOT STOP HERE AND PRACTISE DRAWING THE CELLS 
AND LABELLING THE KEY STRUCTURES 
THESE ARE THE SORT OF QUESTIONS YOU WILL BE ASKED 
MANY CELLS LIKE THESE NERVE CELLS ARE HIGHLY SPECIALISED 
TO DO A PARTICULAR JOB 
WE SAY THEY ARE ADAPTED TO THEIR FUNCTION 
THESE PLANT GUARD CELLS HAVE A DIFFERENT SHAPE 
BUT ALMOST ALL HAVE THE SAME STRUCTURES 
THE DIFFERENT SHAPE ALLOWS IT TO FULFIL ITS SPECIALISED ROLE 
THESE ARE PLANT ROOT HAIR CELLS 
AND THESE ARE HUMAN MUSCLE CELLS 
SO TO SUMMARISE SPECIALISED CELLS WE SAY SOME CELLS ARE ADAPTED TO THEIR FUNCTION 
AND YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE WORDS FUNCTION AND ADAPTED MEAN 
HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF SPECIALISED CELLS 
SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS SECTION LIFE PROCESSES AND CELL ACTIVITY 
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT ANY OF IT PARTICULARLY THOSE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANIMAL AND PLANT CELLS 
YOU CAN REWIND AND CHECK THROUGH THE KEY POINTS AGAIN 
TAKE A BREAK NOW OR MOVE STRAIGHT ON TO THE NEXT UNIT 
NEXT UP HUMANS AS ORGANISMS 
WHICH IS SPLIT OVER THE NEXT TWO SECTIONS 
THE FIRST UNIT IS IN FOUR SECTIONS 
SO LET'S KICK OFF WITH NUTRITION AND THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 
HUMANS NEED FIVE DIFFERENT FOOD TYPES 
ALL ESSENTIAL FOR HEALTHY LIFE 
THIS NEXT CLIP LOOKS AT WHAT FOODS WE NEED AND WHY 
MAKE A NOTE OF ALL THE FOOD TYPES MENTIONED 
TO TAKE PART IN THIS VIGOROUS ACTIVITY 
WE NEED A LOT OF ENERGY TO KEEP OUR BODIES HEALTHY AND ACTIVE 
ALL LIVING THINGS PLANTS AND ANIMALS 
NEED THE MANY DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES CONTAINED IN FOODS 
TO KEEP OUR BODIES HEALTHY AND ACTIVE THROUGHOUT LIFE 
WE NEED TO EAT A VARIETY OF FOODS 
FOODS THAT WE EAT EVERY DAY AS PART OF A HEALTHY DIET 
ARE MADE UP OF COMPLEX SUBSTANCES 
EACH TYPE OF FOOD MAY CONTAIN SEVERAL DIFFERENT NUTRIENTS IN THEM 
NUTRIENTS LIKE CARBOHYDRATES 
PROTEINS FATS VITAMINS AND MINERALS ALSO WATER AND FIBRE 
A DIET WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE NUTRIENTS YOU NEED TO STAY HEALTHY 
IN THE RIGHT PROPORTIONS IS CALLED A BALANCED DIET 
MOST PRE PACKED FOODS HAVE LABELS SHOWING THE QUANTITIES OF NUTRIENTS 
USUALLY IN PORTIONS THAT WE MIGHT NORMALLY EAT IN A MEAL 
WE NEED FAR MORE OF SOME NUTRIENTS THAN OTHERS 
ALTHOUGH VITAMINS AND MINERALS ARE VITAL TO GOOD HEALTH 
THEY'RE ONLY NEEDED IN VERY TINY QUANTITIES 
FOODS SUCH AS POTATOES BREAD PASTA RICE 
BISCUITS CAKES AND SUGAR ARE HIGH IN CARBOHYDRATES 
CARBOHYDRATES CONTAIN STARCHES SUGARS AND CELLULOSE 
AS WE GET A LOT OF OUR ENERGY FROM CARBOHYDRATES 
THEY MAY BE REFERRED TO AS HIGH ENERGY FOODS 
BUT SOME CARBOHYDRATES LIKE WHITE FLOUR AND WHITE SUGAR ARE REFINED 
STRIPPED OF MANY NUTRIENTS AND FIBRE 
WHITE SUGAR GIVES YOU A QUICK BOOST OF ENERGY BUT NOTHING ELSE 
ON THE OTHER HAND LESS REFINED OR COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES 
CONTAIN MANY OF THEIR VITAMINS MINERALS AND FIBRE INTACT 
FOODS LIKE FRUIT VEGETABLES BROWN RICE WHOLEMEAL FOUR 
BEANS AND LENTILS 
UNLIKE REFINED CARBOHYDRATES 
THEY RELEASE A STEADY SUPPLY OF GLUCOSE SUGAR TO THE BODY 
GIVING YOU ENERGY FOR A LONGER TIME 
IN MODERATION CARBOHYDRATES ARE INDISPENSABLE 
IN EXCESS THEY ARE STORED AS FAT 
FOODS LIKE MEAT MILK EGGS BUTTER AND CREAM 
AS WELL AS SEEDS NUTS AND FISH 
ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF FOOD RICH IN FATS 
SOME FAT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL 
IT'S NEEDED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF BRAIN NERVES AND BODY PROCESSES 
AND IS FOUND IN EVERY CELL 
PROTEIN IS FOUND IN FOODS LIKE MEAT EGGS MILK CHEESE 
SOYA NUTS LENTILS AND WHOLEGRAINS 
PROTEINS ARE MAINLY USED BY THE BODY 
FOR MAKING NEW CELLS AND TISSUES 
GROWING CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE NEED TO EAT MORE PROTEINS 
A PREGNANT WOMAN ALSO NEEDS TO EAT MORE PROTEINS 
TO ALLOW FOR THE GROWING BABY 
PROTEINS ARE USED NOT ONLY TO MAKE NEW CELLS FOR GROWTH 
BUT ALSO TO REPLACE AND RENEW OLD AND WORN CELLS 
OUR BODIES ARE LIKE MACHINES 
THERE ARE MANY ACTIVITIES GOING ON INSIDE THEM AT THE SAME TIME 
AND THERE IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE WEAR AND TEAR 
PROTEINS ARE ALSO USED TO MAKE ENZYMES FOR DIGESTING FOOD 
AND ANTIBODIES TO HELP FIGHT INFECTION 
BY EATING A VARIETY OF FOODS 
A GOOD MIXED DIET WILL NOT ONLY PROVIDE THE THREE MAIN NUTRIENTS 
THE CARBOHYDRATES FATS AND PROTEINS 
BUT ALSO ALL THE NECESSARY VITAMINS AND MINERALS THAT OUR BODIES NEED 
BUT CANNOT MAKE FOR THEMSELVES 
SO EATING A BALANCED DIET PROVIDES THE NUTRIENTS WATER AND ROUGHAGE 
NEEDED TO HELP KEEP OUR BODIES AS HEALTHY AND ACTIVE AS POSSIBLE 
THROUGHOUT LIFE 
O. K. TIME TO WRITE DOWN THE DIFFERENT FOOD TYPES MENTIONED IN THE CLIP 
YOU SHOULD HAVE COME UP WITH FIVE DIFFERENT FOOD TYPES 
THE OTHER TWO THINGS YOU NEED FOR A HEALTHY DIET ARE FIBRE AND WATER 
NOT TECHNICALLY FOOD THEY ARE STILL ESSENTIAL FOR A BALANCED DIET 
THEY ALL MAKE UP THE SEVEN COMPONENTS OF A BALANCED DIET 
FOR YOUR TEST YOU SHOULD KNOW THE SEVEN COMPONENTS OF FOOD AND WHAT WE USE THEM FOR 
WE NEED LOTS OF WATER TO REPLACE ALL THAT IS LOST THROUGH EXCRETION AND BREATHING 
TO TURN THIS LIST INTO SOLUBLE SUBSTANCES THAT THE BODY CAN USE DIGESTION NEEDS TO GET TO WORK 
SHE MIGHT NOT REALISE IT BUT HER INVESTIGATIONS HAVE JUST STARTED 
SHE'S TAKEN THE FIRST STEPS IN BREAKING DOWN OF HER FOOD 
THE MOUTH IS LIKE A CHOPPING BOARD WELL IT IS 
THE TEETH CHOP UP THE FOOD AND GRIND IT TO A PULP 
IT'S A VERY PHYSICAL PROCESS 
CHEWING ALSO INCREASES THE SURFACE AREA OF THE FOOD 
WHICH HELPS THE FIRST CHEMICAL PROCESSES OF DIGESTION 
AND THAT'S WHERE SALIVA COMES IN WONDERFUL STUFF SALIVA 
ALL ONE AND A HALF LITRES THE FOOD HAS GOT TO BE BROKEN DOWN CHEMICALLY 
SO THAT THE LARGE MOLECULES OF FOOD CAN BE CHANGED INTO MOLECULES SMALL ENOUGH TO BE ABSORBED BY THE BODY 
SALIVA CONTAINS AN ENZYME WHICH STARTS BREAKING DOWN THE STARCH 
IN THE BREAD AND CHIPS INTO SUGARS THE BODY CAN USE 
THERE'S STILL MORE BREAKING DOWN MORE DIGESTION TO DO 
ONCE THE FOOD REACHES THE STOMACH 
GLANDS IN THE STOMACH LINING SECRETE A LIQUID CALLED THE GASTRIC JUICE WHICH HELPS BREAK DOWN PROTEIN 
EVERYTHING IS CHURNED UP BY THE MUSCLES IN THE STOMACH WALL 
THE LAST OF THE CARBOHYDRATES AND SOME PROTEIN HAVE BEEN BROKEN DOWN 
BUT HARDLY ANY OF THE FAT FROM THE FOOD HAS BEEN DIGESTED YET 
I CAN'T EAT ANOTHER THING OH 
NOW THE FOOD'S IN MY STOMACH 
THE PROTEINS AND CARBOHYDRATES ARE BREAKING DOWN BUT WHAT'S NEXT 
MOVES ON TO THE SMALL INTESTINES 
BY THE END OF THE SMALL INTESTINES 
NEARLY ALL NUTRIENTS FROM THE FOOD HAVE BEEN ABSORBED INTO THE BLOOD SYSTEM 
IT'S ON TO THE LAST STAGE OF DIGESTION THE LARGE INTESTINE WHAT'S ACTUALLY LEFT BY NOW 
ALL THAT'S LEFT IS A LITTLE WATER AND UNDIGESTED FOOD 
FIBRE FOR INSTANCE WHICH HELPS TO KEEP THE FAECES MOIST H. M. M. 
SO THERE'S NOT MUCH OF FEMI'S BURGER LEFT 
A LITTLE BIT OF WATER WHICH HAS BEEN ABSORBED THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE LARGE INTESTINES 
THE REMAINING MATERIAL THE FAECES BECOMES A LITTLE BIT MORE SOLID 
AND THAT PASSES OUT OF THE BODY THROUGH THE ANUS 
THERE YOU HAVE IT THE COMPLETE DIGESTIVE PROCESS OF A HAMBURGER DESCRIBED BY RUSTY THE CHEF 
REMEMBER THAT THE POINT OF DIGESTION IS TO BREAK DOWN OUR FOOD INTO SIMPLER SUBSTANCES 
THAT THE BODY IS THEN ABLE TO USE 
THERE ARE TWO MARKS FOR THIS QUESTION 
SO YOU NEED TO GIVE AT LEAST TWO SEPARATE ANSWERS 
YOUR ANSWER COULD INCLUDE TWO OF THESE POINTS 
THAT'S IT FOR NUTRITION AND DIGESTION BUT IF YOU WEREN'T SURE OF ANY FACTS 
REWIND AND LOOK THROUGH THIS SECTION AGAIN OR YOU CAN MOVE STRAIGHT ON 
OUR SKELETAL SYSTEM CONSISTS OF BONES AND OTHER SOFT TISSUES THAT HOLD US TOGETHER 
WITHOUT A SKELETON WE WOULD BE VERY FLOPPY INDEED 
BUT SUPPORT IS ONLY ONE OF ITS THREE FUNCTIONS 
IT ALSO PROTECTS VITAL ORGANS LIKE THE BRAIN HEART AND LUNGS 
ITS THIRD FUNCTION IS FOR MOVEMENT 
THE SKELETON HAS DIFFERENT TYPES OF JOINTS THE VERTEBRAE 
BALL AND SOCKET JOINTS AND HINGE JOINTS 
LET'S CHECK THROUGH THE KEY POINTS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER ABOUT JOINTS 
JOINTS ARE POINTS IN THE SKELETON WHERE TWO OR MORE BONES MEET 
AND THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF JOINTS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT 
BUT HOW DO JOINTS HELP US TO MOVE OR DO ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER 
HOW DO THEY WORK 
PICK UP A DRINK THAT'S MY HINGE JOINT 
AND TO JUMP OFF THIS BENCH OR JOG ON THE SPOT I'M USING ALL THE DIFFERENT JOINTS 
BUT JUST HOW DO THEY WORK 
LOOKING INSIDE A RUNNING KNEE JOINT THE MUSCLES THAT CAUSE MOVEMENT ARE ATTACHED TO BONES 
THEY'RE CALLED SKELETAL MUSCLES 
SO IT'S SKELETAL MUSCLES THAT MOVE YOUR BODY 
AND THEY WORK IN PAIRS 
YOU CAN FEEL TWO OF THESE WORKING TOGETHER WHEN YOU BEND AND STRAIGHTEN YOUR ARM 
YOU CAN SEE IT WITH THIS MODEL 
TO BEND YOUR ARM THE BICEPS CONTRACTS 
IT GETS SHORTER 
YOU CAN SEE IT BULGE AND HARDEN 
THE TRICEPS RELAXES 
AS A RESULT THE BICEPS PULLS THE BONES TOGETHER AND THE ARM BENDS 
TO STRAIGHTEN YOUR ARM THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS 
THE TRICEPS CONTRACTS AND THE BICEPS RELAXES 
THIS PULLS THE BONES STRAIGHT 
MUSCLES CAN ONLY CONTRACT AND PULL BONES NEVER PUSH THEM 
NOW SOME FACTS ABOUT MOVEMENT THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW 
RESPIRATION AND BREATHING ARE TWO PROCESSES THAT CAN BE CONFUSING 
LET'S LOOK AT RESPIRATION FIRST WHEN DOING ANY ACTIVITY 
WE NEED ENERGY BUT WHERE DOES THIS ENERGY COME FROM 
TO RELEASE ENERGY FROM THE FOOD WE EAT OUR BODIES NEED OXYGEN 
THIS OXYGEN REACTS WITH THE FOOD WE HAVE EATEN TO RELEASE ENERGY 
THIS IS RESPIRATION BREATHING USING OUR LUNGS 
IS SIMPLY HOW OXYGEN GETS INTO OUR BODIES 
O. K. HERE ARE SOME DEFINITIONS 
FIRST OF ALL RESPIRATION IS AEROBIC 
AEROBIC MEANS WITH OXYGEN AND AEROBIC RESPIRATION IS THE PROCESS 
BY WHICH LIVING ORGANISMS USE OXYGEN TO RELEASE ENERGY FROM THE FOOD THEY'VE EATEN 
REMEMBER IN RESPIRATION OXYGEN IS USED TO RELEASE ENERGY 
BREATHING IS JUST THE PROCESS THAT ALLOWS OXYGEN INTO OUR BODIES 
AND CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER TO BE EXCRETED NOW LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT RESPIRATION 
WHETHER YOU'RE PLAYING SPORTS WALKING OR JUST SITTING AROUND 
YOU'RE USING ENERGY 
YOUR BODY NEEDS ENERGY FOR GROWTH MOVEMENT AND TO REPAIR CELLS 
IN FACT THE SAME IS TRUE OF ALL LIVING THINGS INCLUDING PLANTS 
THIS ENERGY IS LOCKED IN GLUCOSE 
WHICH COMES FROM THE FOOD WE EAT AND WHICH PLANTS MAKE THEMSELVES 
IT IS STORED IN THE CELLS OF THE BODY 
THE ENERGY LOCKED INTO THE GLUCOSE IS USUALLY RELEASED BY USING OXYGEN 
BREATHING IS THE FIRST STEP 
IN GETTING OXYGEN TO THE CELLS FOR RESPIRATION 
BY BREATHING IN WE TAKE THE AIR INTO OUR LUNGS 
FROM WHERE OXYGEN IS TRANSPORTED BY BLOOD TO THE CELLS 
BREATHING IS AN IMPORTANT WAY OF GETTING OXYGEN INTO OUR LUNGS 
BUT IT MUSTN'T BE CONFUSED WITH THE PROCESS OF RESPIRATION 
THE AIR ENTERS THE LUNGS ONCE THIS SHEET OF MUSCLE THE DIAPHRAGM 
IS CONTRACTED AND BECOMES FLATTER 
AND THESE MUSCLES BETWEEN THE RIBS HAVE RAISED THE CHEST UP AND OUT 
THE AIR FLOWING IN IS COLDER AND DRIER THAN THE AIR EXHALED 
IT ALSO CONTAINS MORE OXYGEN AND LESS CARBON DIOXIDE 
DRUMS KEEP POUNDING A RHYTHM TO THE BRAIN 
LA DEE D. A. DEE DEE 
LA DEE D. A. DEE DEE 
AND THE BEAT GOES ON 
THE INHALED AIR TRAVELS DOWN THE WINDPIPE AND VIA THE SMALLER TUBES 
EVENTUALLY REACHES THESE TINY AIR SACS CALLED ALVEOLI 
EACH ALVEOLUS IS SO TINY A GRAIN OF SALT WOULD MORE THAN FILL IT 
THEY GIVE THE LUNGS A LARGE SURFACE AREA 
HAVE A GOOD BLOOD SUPPLY AND VERY THIN MOIST WALLS 
IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR THE EXCHANGE OF GASES 
THEY ALLOW OXYGEN TO PASS INTO THE BLOOD 
AND CARBON DIOXIDE TO PASS OUT OF THE BLOOD 
ALL THE ALVEOLI HAVE A HUGE SURFACE AREA FORTY TIMES THAT OF THE SKIN 
THIS ENABLES LARGE AMOUNTS OF OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE 
TO PASS INTO OR OUT OF THE BODY EFFICIENTLY 
WE ALL HAVE MILES AND MILES OF BLOOD VESSELS IN OUR BODIES 
DRUMS KEEP POUNDING A RHYTHM TO THE BRAIN 
BLOOD LOADED WITH OXYGEN IS CARRIED FROM THE LUNGS TO THE HEART 
THE HEART THEN PUMPS THE BLOOD AROUND THE BODY AND THE ARTERIES 
THE ARTERIES DIVIDE INTO VERY THIN VESSELS CALLED CAPILLARIES 
THAT CARRY THIS OXYGEN RICH BLOOD TO OUR CELLS 
WHERE RESPIRATION TAKES PLACE 
BLOOD NOW HIGH IN CARBON DIOXIDE 
IS CARRIED IN VEINS BACK TO THE LUNGS VIA THE HEART 
AND THE BEAT GOES ON AND THE BEAT GOES ON 
WHEN OXYGEN IS USED IN RESPIRATION 
IN SOME WAYS IT IS SIMILAR TO BURNING 
OXYGEN COMBINES WITH FOOD SUBSTANCES THE FUEL 
TO RELEASE ENERGY AS HEAT 
FOR BURNING HAPPENS VERY QUICKLY WITH A SUDDEN BURST OF ENERGY 
WITH RESPIRATION HOWEVER 
ENERGY IS RELEASED IN A MORE CONTROLLED AND MANAGEABLE WAY 
THROUGH A SERIES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN THE CELLS 
AND SO RESPIRATION CAN BE SUMMARISED WITH THIS EQUATION 
WHEN GLUCOSE COMBINES WITH OXYGEN TO GIVE ENERGY 
CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER ARE THE WASTE PRODUCTS 
AND THE BEAT GOES ON 
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT EQUATION 
AS IT'S VITAL FOR YOUR TEST THAT YOU KNOW IT OFF BY HEART 
GLUCOSE AND OXYGEN PRODUCE ENERGY 
AND CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER 
WHY NOT STOP THE PROGRAMME AND TRY WRITING IT OUT FROM MEMORY 
SO FAR WE'VE SEEN HOW OXYGEN IS USED TO RELEASE ENERGY 
BUT HOW DOES THE OXYGEN FIRST REACH THE CELLS AND TISSUES 
AIR GOES DOWN YOUR THROAT THROUGH A PIPE CALLED THE TRACHEA 
WHICH BRANCHES INTO TWO BRONCHI 
ONE BRONCHUS INTO EACH OF THE TWO LUNGS 
THESE IN TURN BRANCH INTO A NETWORK OF SMALLER TUBES CALLED BRONCHIOLES 
OXYGEN IS ABSORBED INTO THE BLOOD 
AND CARBON DIOXIDE PASSES OUT IN THE AIR SACS 
WHEN YOU DRAW A SKETCH OF THE LUNGS YOU NEED TO KNOW THEIR STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION 
YOU NEED TO INCLUDE THE TRACHEA DIVIDING INTO THE TWO BRONCHI 
INSIDE EACH LUNG THE BRONCHUS DIVIDES INTO MANY BRONCHIOLES 
AT THE END OF THE BRONCHIOLES ARE AIR SACS CALLED ALVEOLI 
BY EXPANDING AND CONTRACTING OUR LUNGS ARE ABLE TO TAKE IN OXYGEN 
AND BREATHE OUT CARBON DIOXIDE 
BUT AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE CLIPS THEY HAVE OTHER SPECIAL FEATURES 
YOU CAN STOP THE PROGRAMME NOW AND TRY ANSWERING THIS QUESTION 
YOUR ANSWER CAN INCLUDE FOUR DIFFERENT POINTS 
IN THE LAST SECTION WE LOOKED AT DIGESTION AND NUTRITION MOVEMENT 
RESPIRATION AND BREATHING 
IF YOU FEEL UNCERTAIN ABOUT THESE REWIND AND GO OVER THEM AGAIN 
HERE ARE A FEW TIPS FOR REMEMBERING THE FACTS 
MY TIP FOR REVISING WOULD BE TO LIST YOUR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES 
AND THEN WORK ON YOUR WEAKNESSES 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THIS UNIT IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO TAKE A BREAK OR GO ON TO THE NEXT ONE 
PART TWO ON HUMANS AS ORGANISMS HAS FIVE SECTIONS 
LET'S START WITH THE FIRST CIRCULATION 
THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS PROVIDE A ROUTE SYSTEM AROUND THE BODY 
BUT IT'S THE BLOOD WHICH TRANSPORTS OXYGEN FOOD AND HORMONES 
TO PARTS OF THE BODY THAT NEED THEM AND CARRIES AWAY WASTE PRODUCTS 
THESE SUBSTANCES JOIN AND LEAVE THE BLOOD AT THIN WALLED BLOOD VESSELS 
CALLED CAPILLARIES BY DIFFUSION WHICH YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT LATER 
YOU CAN SEE THE BLOOD MOVING THROUGH THIS NETWORK OF TINY VESSELS 
THE CAPILLARY TUBE IS ONLY ONE CELL THICK AND EASILY ALLOWS GAS EXCHANGE TO TAKE PLACE 
OXYGEN FOOD AND HORMONES LEAVE THE BLOOD HERE 
AND CARBON DIOXIDE AND OTHER WASTE PRODUCTS JOIN THE BLOOD 
READY TO BE CARRIED AWAY 
THESE LAST KEY POINTS ABOUT BLOOD ARE REALLY IMPORTANT 
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE ABOUT THE FUNCTION OF BLOOD AND STRUCTURE OF CAPILLARIES GO BACK OVER IT AGAIN 
THE SUBJECT OF REPRODUCTION IN HUMANS IS QUITE COMPLEX 
SO WE'VE SPLIT IT INTO TWO SECTIONS WITH BITESIZE CHUNKS SO YOU CAN CONCENTRATE ON ONE BIT AT A TIME 
FIRST ADOLESCENCE AND THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE WHEN A HUMAN'S REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS BECOME MATURE 
AND THE PERSON CHANGES FROM A CHILD INTO AN ADULT 
THIS PERIOD OF TIME IS PUBERTY 
BOYS USUALLY START TO PRODUCE SPERM BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWELVE AND SIXTEEN 
GIRLS START TO RELEASE EGGS BETWEEN THE AGES OF ELEVEN AND FIFTEEN 
DURING ADOLESCENCE WHICH FOLLOWS PUBERTY 
MANY OTHER CHANGES HAPPEN TO OUR BODIES BOTH PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL 
ALL THESE CHANGES ARE CAUSED BY VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF VERY POWERFUL CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES CALLED HORMONES 
IN THE NEXT CLIPS WE'LL RUN THROUGH MANY CHANGES TO GIRLS AND BOYS 
SO MAKE A NOTE OF THE ONES YOU NOTICE 
YOU ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO SKETCH AND LABEL BOTH THE MALE AND FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 
IN THE MALE SKETCH YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THE PENIS 
TESTES 
SPERM DUCT 
AND URETHRA 
AND IN THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 
MAKE SURE YOU LABEL THE OVARY 
FALLOPIAN TUBE OR OVIDUCT 
UTERUS 
CERVIX 
AND VAGINA 
ALSO REMEMBER TO ALWAYS USE A PENCIL AND A RULER FOR LABELLING DIAGRAMS 
WHY NOT HAVE A GO AND PRACTISE DRAWING THEM NOW 
NOW LET'S LOOK AT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE HUMAN REPRODUCTIVE PROCESS THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE 
A WOMAN IS USUALLY FERTILE BETWEEN THE AGES OF ELEVEN AND FIFTY 
THIS MEANS EACH MONTH AN EGG IS RELEASED FROM ONE OF THE OVARIES 
THE LINING OF THE UTERUS THICKENS WITH A LARGE SUPPLY OF BLOOD TO RECEIVE AN EGG 
IF THE EGG IS NOT FERTILISED THE LINING OF THE UTERUS BREAKS DOWN AND PASSES OUT OF THE VAGINA 
THIS MONTHLY BLEED OCCURS ON AVERAGE EVERY TWENTY EIGHT DAYS THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE 
IF SEXUAL INTERCOURSE TAKES PLACE AND THE EGG IS FERTILISED 
THE LINING OF THE UTERUS STAYS INTACT AND THERE IS NO PERIOD 
THE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE LINING INCREASES READY FOR A FERTILISED EGG 
FERTILISATION IS THE STAGE OF REPRODUCTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT NEXT 
IF INTERCOURSE TAKES PLACE FERTILISATION MAY OCCUR 
THE SPERM RELEASED FROM THE PENIS SWIM ALONG THE FALLOPIAN TUBE OR OVIDUCT 
THERE THEY MAY MEET AN EGG 
SO FERTILISATION IS WHEN ONE SINGLE SPERM FUSES WITH THE LARGER EGG 
NOW THE UTERUS WALL REMAINS INTACT 
AND THE FERTILISED EGG CELL STARTS DIVIDING AND EMBEDS ITSELF INTO THE UTERUS LINING 
FOR YOUR TEST IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THE ORDER OF EVENTS IN REPRODUCTION WELL 
SO HERE IS THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS 
OVULATION AND THEN IF INTERCOURSE OCCURS FERTILISATION 
THAT'S THE FUSION OF SPERM AND EGG TAKING PLACE 
THEN CELL DIVISION TO FORM A BALL OF CELLS 
AND AFTER THAT IMPLANTATION INTO THE THICKENED UTERUS LINING 
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER FERTILISATION 
WE FIND THE EMBRYO FOCUS ON IT 
SET THE VIDEO RECORDER GOING TO GET ONE SHOT EVERY TWO SECONDS 
AND WE LEAVE THE EMBRYO THERE FOR ABOUT A WEEK 
WHAT YOU START OFF WITH IS A FERTILISED EGG WHICH IS A LARGE CELL 
AND THIS CELL WILL DIVIDE ABOUT ONCE EVERY DAY INITIALLY 
AND THESE CELLS CARRY ON DIVIDING 
UNTIL THERE ARE ABOUT EIGHT OR SIXTEEN CELLS 
ABOUT THREE DAYS AFTER THE ONE CELL STAGE 
THEN FINALLY IT GETS TO THE STAGE 
WHERE IT WANTS TO HATCH OUT OF THE JELLY COATING 
THAT HAS BEEN PROTECTING IT DURING EARLIER DEVELOPMENT 
THEN IT'S READY TO IMPLANT IN THE LINING OF THE WOMB 
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO LOOK AT HOW THE GROWING FOETUS DEVELOPS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PLACENTA 
AFTER ABOUT NINE WEEKS THE LIMBS ARE VISIBLE 
AND THE EMBRYO BECOMES A FOETUS 
THE HEART MUST BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO PUMP BLOOD ROUND THE EMBRYO'S BODY 
AND OUT TO THE LINING OF THE WOMB 
THIS BLOOD VESSEL EXTENDS FROM THE EMBRYO TO A REMARKABLE STRUCTURE THE YOLK S. A. C. 
ALTHOUGH THERE'S NO YOLK INSIDE 
THE EMBRYOS OF OTHER ANIMALS FROM WHICH WE HAVE EVOLVED 
ARE NOURISHED BY FOOD STORED IN THE YOLK S. A. C. 
HUMAN EMBRYOS HOWEVER OBTAIN THEIR FOOD BY WAY OF THE PLACENTA 
BLOOD VESSELS FROM THE EMBRYO SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE LINING OF THE WOMB 
HERE THE PLACENTA DEVELOPS TO PROVIDE THE INTERCHANGE OF FOOD OXYGEN AND OTHER SUBSTANCES 
BETWEEN THE MOTHER'S BLOOD AND THAT OF HER GROWING BABY 
THE ARTERIES AND VEINS JOIN TO FORM THE MAJOR VESSELS OF THE UMBILICAL CORD 
THE LIFELINE BETWEEN MOTHER AND BABY 
THE PLACENTA BRINGS THE FOETAL BLOOD INTO CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE MOTHER'S BLOOD 
BUT THE TWO DON'T MIX 
THE BLOOD PASSES TO THE FOETUS THROUGH THE UMBILICAL CORD 
THE PLACENTA ALSO ACTS AS A BARRIER TO HARMFUL SUBSTANCES 
SUCH AS PATHOGENS AND SOME DRUGS 
THAT'S AN INTERESTING ONE 
THE PLACENTA GROWS AND DEVELOPS ALONGSIDE THE FOETUS BUT WHAT IS ITS SPECIAL JOB 
THERE ARE TWO MAIN POINTS STOP THE PROGRAMME AND WRITE THEM DOWN OR MOVE STRAIGHT ON TO THE ANSWER 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF OUR REVISION ON REPRODUCTION 
BUT MAKE SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE KEY POINTS IF NOT YOU CAN REWIND AND GO THROUGH THEM AGAIN 
REMEMBER TO REVISE IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
DIFFERENT WAYS OF REVISING SUIT DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
THIS IS A MAN OF FIFTY THREE WHO SMOKED HIMSELF TO DEATH TWENTY YEARS TOO SOON 
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN SMOKING AND DEVELOPED A COUGH AND PRODUCED SOME BLOOD AND WENT TO HIS DOCTOR 
WHO DID A CHEST X. RAY AND SHOWED THERE WAS A TUMOUR IN TWO MONTHS HE'S DEAD 
ALTHOUGH NICOTINE IS POISONOUS YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH FROM SMOKING TO KILL YOU 
THERE ARE MANY OTHER CHEMICALS IN CIGARETTE SMOKE AND THEY ARE GROUPED TOGETHER AS TAR 
EACH OF THESE FLASKS CONTAINS THE DISSOLVED TAR FROM ONE CIGARETTE 
THIS BLACK TREACLY SUBSTANCE IS TAR AND HAS OVER FOUR THOUSAND CHEMICALS IN IT 
WE KNOW THAT IT CAUSES CANCER WE KNOW THAT IT CAUSES A NARROWING OF THE AIRWAYS INTO THE LUNGS 
WE KNOW IT CAUSES AN INCREASE IN MUCUS PRODUCTION 
AND WE KNOW IT DAMAGES THE LITTLE HAIRS THAT LINE THE LUNGS THAT HELP PROTECT THEM FROM DIRT AND DISEASES 
SMOKING PRODUCES CHEMICALS THAT HAVE A LONG TERM EFFECT ON HEALTH LET'S CHECK THROUGH THE KEY POINTS 
BESIDES SMOKING YOU ALSO NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND OTHER HARMFUL SUBSTANCES 
AS WE RUN THROUGH THE LIST WHY NOT MAKE A NOTE OF THEM AND HOW THEY AFFECT THE BODY 
ANY DRUG IF ABUSED CAN CAUSE PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO OUR BODIES 
DRUGS CAN ALSO CAUSE PERSONAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS 
WE'VE JUST SEEN THE SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY SMOKING NOW LET'S LOOK AT ALCOHOL 
LARGE QUANTITIES OF ALCOHOL SLOW DOWN THE DRINKER'S BRAIN ACTIVITY 
MAKING THEM CLUMSY AND SLOW TO REACT 
CONTINUED ABUSE WILL DAMAGE THE BRAIN AND THE LIVER 
NEXT SOLVENTS INHALED SOLVENTS SUCH AS GLUES AND PAINTS 
PRODUCE HALLUCINATIONS 
AND PERMANENT DAMAGE TO THE LUNGS BRAIN LIVER AND KIDNEYS 
OTHER DRUGS SUCH AS HEROIN COCAINE AND ECSTASY 
CAN HAVE A RAPID EFFECT ON HEALTH 
AND LARGE DOSES CAN CAUSE DEATH 
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT THIS SUBJECT BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW SOME EFFECTS OF DRUGS 
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE OF THE FACTS WHY NOT REWIND AND GO THROUGH THEM AGAIN 
EVERYDAY LIFE EXPOSES US TO OTHER THREATS TO OUR HEALTH 
AND ONE MAJOR CAUSE OF ILL HEALTH IS MICRO ORGANISMS 
NOT ALL MICRO ORGANISMS ARE BAD NEWS BUT THE ONES THAT ARE ARE CALLED PATHOGENS 
THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES BACTERIA AND VIRUSES 
IN REALITY VIRUSES ARE ONE HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND TIMES SMALLER THAN BACTERIA 
AND EVEN IF WE PUT ONE THOUSAND BACTERIA END TO END THEY WOULD ONLY COVER ONE MILLIMETRE 
LET'S LOOK AT BACTERIA FIRST 
BACTERIA ARE SINGLE CELLED MICRO ORGANISMS AND HAVE NO DISTINCT NUCLEUS 
THEIR GENETIC MATERIAL OR D. N. A. IS WITHIN THEIR CELL WALLS 
TYPICAL BACTERIAL DISEASES ARE TETANUS CHOLERA AND TUBERCULOSIS 
AND FOOD POISONING IS VERY COMMON 
THE SECOND TYPE OF MICRO ORGANISM IS THE VIRUS 
THE COMMON COLD FLU AND MEASLES ARE ALL CAUSED BY VIRUSES AND H. I. V. IS THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES AIDS 
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A VIRUS AND A BACTERIUM IS THE VIRUS DOES NOT HAVE A CELL WALL 
ONLY A PROTEIN COAT SURROUNDING A FEW GENES 
FOR VIRUSES TO LIVE AND GROW THEY TAKE POSSESSION OF A LIVING CELL 
THIS IS WHERE THEY SET ABOUT THEIR DESTRUCTION AND REPRODUCE RAPIDLY 
ANTIBIOTICS ONLY WORK WITH BACTERIA 
BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE VACCINES FOR SOME VIRUSES 
YOU DON'T NEED AN IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT BACTERIA AND VIRUSES 
BUT IT IS GOOD TO KNOW SOME OF THEIR CHARACTERISTICS AND IMPORTANTLY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM 
LET'S CHECK THROUGH THEM AGAIN 
VIRUSES HAVE TO INVADE AN ORGANISM'S CELL TO REPRODUCE 
BRILLIANT NOW YOU'VE COMPLETED HUMANS AS ORGANISMS 
CHECK THROUGH AGAIN IF YOU NEED TO REVISIT ANY OF THE TOPICS THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO TAKE A BREAK 
THIS UNIT IS GOING TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF PLANTS AS LIVING ORGANISMS 
WE'LL START OFF WITH PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND RESPIRATION 
PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS THE KEY PROCESS FOR PLANTS 
THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW REALLY WELL 
PHOTOSYNTHESIS MEANS MAKING THROUGH LIGHT 
THIS CLIP LOOKS AT THE FOUR THINGS PLANTS NEED FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
TAKE A LOOK AND WRITE DOWN WHAT THESE ARE 
A SUNNY DAY A PICNIC IN A PARK 
THE PERFECT INGREDIENTS FOR A LAZY AFTERNOON JUST HANGING OUT 
BUT WHILE YOU'RE THERE SPARE A THOUGHT FOR THE PLANTS 
WHILE YOU'RE FINDING THE BEST SPOT FOR THAT PICNIC 
THEY'RE MAKING THEIR OWN FOOD 
THIS UNIT LOOKS AT HOW GREEN PLANTS PRODUCE FOOD IN AN AMAZING WAY 
USING JUST WATER CARBON DIOXIDE GAS AND SUNLIGHT 
THIS PROCESS IN PLANTS OF MAKING THEIR OWN FOOD 
IS KNOWN AS PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
LEAVES ARE GREEN AS THEY CONTAIN A SUBSTANCE CALLED CHLOROPHYLL 
CHLOROPHYLL IS STORED INSIDE THE CHLOROPLASTS OF THE CELLS 
AND CAN ABSORB THE LIGHT ENERGY FROM THE SUN 
PLANTS THEN USE THIS LIGHT ENERGY 
TOGETHER WITH CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER TO MAKE FOOD 
SO HAVE A NICE DAY 
HAVE A NICE DAY 
HAVE A NICE DAY 
BUT HOW ON EARTH IS CARBON DIOXIDE 
A GAS THAT'S PART OF THE AIR AROUND US 
AND WATER A PRETTY ORDINARY LIQUID ACTUALLY MADE INTO FOOD 
WATER USUALLY RAINWATER SEEPS INTO THE SOIL 
ENTERS THE PLANT THROUGH ITS ROOTS AND TRAVELS UP TO THE LEAVES 
WHERE THE NEXT INGREDIENT THE CARBON DIOXIDE ENTERS THE PLANT 
PHOTOSYNTHESIS HAPPENS WITHIN THE GREEN PARTS OF PLANTS 
BUT MOSTLY IN LEAF CELLS 
IN THIS LEAF CROSS SECTION THE CARBON DIOXIDE IS SEEN PASSING IN 
THROUGH TINY HOLES CALLED STOMATA ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE LEAF 
THE FOOD THAT'S MADE IS A SUGAR CALLED GLUCOSE 
WHICH IS TRANSPORTED FROM THE LEAVES TO THE REST OF THE PLANT 
IN PHLOEM TUBES 
IN MAKING THIS FOOD OXYGEN IS A WASTE PRODUCT 
THE OXYGEN LEAVES THE LEAF THROUGH THE STOMATA 
THE SAME TINY HOLES THROUGH WHICH CARBON DIOXIDE ENTERS 
HAVE A NICE DAY 
HAVE A NICE DAY 
PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS SIMPLY CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER 
BEING CONVERTED INTO GLUCOSE AND OXYGEN USING THE SUN'S ENERGY 
ALTHOUGH OXYGEN IS A WASTE PRODUCT FOR THE PLANT 
IT'S USEFUL STUFF ESPECIALLY FOR HUMANS AND OTHER ANIMALS 
AS WE TAKE IT IN FROM THE AIR 
YOU SHOULD HAVE COME UP WITH FOUR THINGS FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER THE RAW INGREDIENTS 
CHLOROPHYLL IN THE GREEN LEAVES 
AND SUNLIGHT WHICH PROVIDES THE ENERGY FOR THE PROCESS 
THESE MAKE GLUCOSE A SIMPLE SUGAR THE MAIN PRODUCT OF THE REACTION 
AND OXYGEN IS ALSO PRODUCED 
PHOTOSYNTHESIS TAKES PLACE IN ALL OF THE GREEN PARTS OF PLANTS 
BUT THE LEAVES ARE THE MAJOR SITE 
THE LEAF IS ADAPTED WELL FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
IT'S PACKED WITH CHLOROPLASTS WHICH CONTAIN CHLOROPHYLL 
THIS ABSORBS THE SUNLIGHT 
AND MAKES THE ENERGY AVAILABLE FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
THIS WORD EQUATION IS REALLY CRUCIAL FOR YOUR TEST 
CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER IN THE PRESENCE OF SUNLIGHT 
GIVE GLUCOSE AND OXYGEN 
YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS OFF BY HEART 
WHY NOT WRITE IT OUT UNTIL YOU HAVE NO PROBLEMS REMEMBERING IT 
AS WELL AS PHOTOSYNTHESISING PLANTS ALSO RESPIRE 
JUST LIKE ANIMALS WHEN PLANTS RESPIRE THEY USE OXYGEN IN THE AIR AND PRODUCE CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER 
BUT IN THE LIGHT PLANTS PHOTOSYNTHESISE TOO 
SO TO INVESTIGATE THE GAS EXCHANGE IN RESPIRATION ALONE 
I'LL HAVE TO DO THE NEXT EXPERIMENT IN THE DARK 
NO LIGHT MEANS NO PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
THIS CYLINDER PASSES PURE OXYGEN DOWN THIS TUBING INTO A BELL JAR 
THERE'S NO CARBON DIOXIDE IN THERE AT ALL 
ANOTHER TUBE PASSES THE OUTLET GAS THROUGH THIS BICARBONATE INDICATOR 
LEFT OVERNIGHT IF THE PLANT IS PRODUCING CARBON DIOXIDE 
THE INDICATOR WILL TURN YELLOW 
SO SURE ENOUGH JUST LIKE US 
THIS PLANT IS PRODUCING CARBON DIOXIDE 
PLANTS NOT ONLY RESPIRE AT NIGHT BUT DURING THE DAY AS WELL BUT WHY DO PLANTS NEED TO RESPIRE 
PLANTS NEED TO RESPIRE TO RELEASE ENERGY FROM THE FOOD OR GLUCOSE THEY HAVE MADE AND STORED 
AND THEY NEED ENERGY TO GROW TO TAKE UP MINERALS REPRODUCE MOVE AND MAKE SPECIALISED CELLS 
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT TO GET TO GRIPS WITH 
AS WELL AS PHOTOSYNTHESISING PLANTS NEED TO RESPIRE TO RELEASE ENERGY 
PLANTS JUST LIKE ANIMALS BREAK DOWN THEIR STORED GLUCOSE 
BY USING OXYGEN TO RELEASE ENERGY PRODUCING CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER 
AS WE KNOW FROM THAT CRUCIAL WORD EQUATION 
PHOTOSYNTHESIS PRODUCES GLUCOSE A TYPE OF SUGAR 
BUT PLANTS NEED MORE THAN SUGAR TO SURVIVE 
A SUNFLOWER MIGHT PRODUCE THIS MUCH SUGAR IN PERFECT CONDITIONS 
ON AN EIGHTEEN HOUR SUNNY DAY 
AND A BANANA TREE WITH ITS LOVELY BIG LEAVES 
MIGHT PRODUCE THIS MUCH 
AND THIS YOUNGSTER 
WITH ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND LEAVES 
WITH ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND LEAVES 
CAN PRODUCE A MASSIVE THIRTY KILOGRAMS OF SUGAR IN A DAY 
BESIDES THE GLUCOSE THAT PLANTS MAKE FROM PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
PLANTS ALSO NEED MINERAL SALTS FOR HEALTHY GROWTH 
THEY ABSORB THESE ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS USING THEIR ROOTS AND WE'LL LOOK AT THESE IN MORE DETAIL 
BUT PLANTS NEED SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL AS LIGHT IN ORDER TO MAKE FOOD FOR THEMSELVES 
THEY NEED WATER AND THE NUTRIENTS THAT ARE DISSOLVED IN IT 
THAT OF COURSE THEY SUCK UP FROM THE GROUND 
THE ROOTS WITH WHICH THEY DO SO PROBE DOWNWARDS SEEKING MOISTURE 
TO GET THAT THEY HAVE TO POSITION THEMSELVES WITH AS MUCH ACCURACY 
AS THE LEAVES DO WHEN FINDING LIGHT 
HAVING FOUND WATER THEY PUT OUT THIN ROOTLETS 
AND FROM THEM A FUR OF TINY HAIRS 
SO MULTIPLYING MANY THOUSANDS OF TIMES THE SURFACE AREA THROUGH WHICH WATER CAN BE SUCKED IN 
A DIAGRAM OF A ROOT HAIR CELL WILL LOOK LIKE THIS 
IT'S ADAPTED TO HAVE A LARGE SURFACE AREA FOR THE ABSORPTION OF WATER AND MINERAL SALTS 
BUT REMEMBER IT'S LIKE A PLANT CELL THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH 
WITH A NUCLEUS 
VACUOLE 
CELLULOSE CELL WALL AND A CELL MEMBRANE 
REMEMBER TO TAKE TIME TO LABEL YOUR DIAGRAMS 
FROM THE LAST TWO SECTIONS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THAT NUTRIENTS ARE REQUIRED FOR PLANT GROWTH 
AND PLANTS HAVE SPECIALISED CELLS CALLED ROOT HAIRS WHICH ABSORB WATER AND MINERAL SALTS FROM THE SOIL 
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP FOR YOUR UPCOMING TESTS 
THAT'S IT FOR PLANTS AS ORGANISMS DON'T FORGET YOU CAN PLAY BACK ANY SECTIONS YOU'RE NOT SURE OF 
THIS UNIT ON VARIATION CLASSIFICATION AND INHERITANCE 
IS SPLIT INTO FOUR SECTIONS LET'S KICK OFF WITH VARIATION 
A SPECIES IS A GROUP OF LIVING THINGS THAT CAN INTERBREED SUCCESSFULLY 
TO PRODUCE FERTILE YOUNG 
THERE ARE MANY SPECIES OF SHARK LIKE THE GREAT WHITE AND HAMMERHEAD 
BUT THESE CAN'T SUCCESSFULLY INTERBREED 
BUT IF WE LOOK AT OURSELVES WITHIN OUR OWN SPECIES WE ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER 
VARIATION IS THE NAME GIVEN TO THESE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE SAME SPECIES 
THE VARIATION WITHIN OUR SPECIES OR ANY OTHER IS CAUSED BY OUR GENETIC MAKE UP AND THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND WE'LL LOOK AT THESE GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS NEXT 
THE VARIATION IS CAUSED PARTLY BY THE GENETIC MATERIAL WE'VE INHERITED FROM OUR PARENTS 
YOUR EYES AND NOSE MAY BE THE SAME SHAPE AS YOUR MUM'S BUT THE SHAPE OF YOUR FACE MAY BE LIKE YOUR DAD'S 
THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE GENETIC DECIDED BY THE GENES WE HAVE INHERITED FROM OUR PARENTS 
THE GENES THAT CARRY THE BLUEPRINT OF OUR INHERITED FEATURES 
CAN BE FOUND INSIDE THE NUCLEUS OF ALMOST EVERY CELL IN OUR BODIES 
ALL ANIMALS PASS CODED MESSAGES FROM PARENT TO CHILD 
MESSAGES INSTRUCTING THE GROWING FOETUS TO DEVELOP BLOOD CELLS 
BONE CELLS OR BRAIN CELLS 
AND THESE MESSAGES ARE CALLED GENES 
TO FIND OUT WHAT GENES ARE AND HOW ALL THIS INFORMATION GETS TRANSFERRED 
I WENT TO SEE DOCTOR FRAN BALKWILL 
WHAT'S IN THESE TUBES FRAN WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THE CHEMICAL INSTRUCTIONS OF LIFE 
STRANDS AND STRANDS OF GENES THAT ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE A HUMAN BEING THE SECRET OF LIFE 
WHAT DO THESE GENES DO THE EASIEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT GENES IS THAT THEY'RE RECIPES 
GENES ARE RECIPES FOR MAKING PROTEINS 
EACH GENE IN YOUR BODY IS A RECIPE FOR MAKING ONE PROTEIN 
IT COULD MAKE YOUR EYES THE COLOUR THEY ARE OR YOUR SKIN THE COLOUR IT IS 
YOU'VE GOT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND GENE RECIPES IN YOUR BODY WHERE DO WE FIND GENES 
IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR CELLS 
THERE'S ABOUT TEN MILLION CELLS IN MY LITTLE FINGER 
EVERY ONE OF THOSE CELLS HAS GOT AN IDENTICAL COPY OF ALL THE GENES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE ME 
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU AND ME EYE COLOUR HAIR COLOUR BLOOD GROUP ARE DECIDED BY THE GENES WE INHERIT 
NOT QUITE EVERYTHING ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES ALSO AFFECT VARIATION THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US 
ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES OF VARIATION ARE DUE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS OF OUR UPBRINGING 
EXERCISE AND DIET ARE OBVIOUS EXAMPLES OF DIFFERENT LIFESTYLES 
BUT WHAT ABOUT INTELLIGENCE ATHLETICISM AND PERSONALITY 
THESE ARE COMBINATIONS OF BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES 
PLANT VARIATIONS WITHIN A SPECIES ARE ALSO DUE TO THEIR GENETIC MAKE UP AND THE ENVIRONMENT 
BUT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS HAVE A MUCH GREATER EFFECT ON HOW A PLANT TURNS OUT 
MORE SUNLIGHT SOIL NUTRIENTS AND WATER CAN MAKE ONE PLANT TWICE AS BIG AS ANOTHER 
USING VARIATION WITHIN A SPECIES OVER HUNDREDS OF GENERATIONS 
NEW VARIETIES CAN BE BRED WITH DESIRABLE FEATURES 
THIS IS CALLED SELECTIVE BREEDING AND WE CAN SEE IT ALL AROUND US 
LET'S LOOK AT A SPECIES MORE FAMILIAR TO US 
THERE'S A HUGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BREEDS OF DOGS 
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE SELECTED DIFFERENT DOGS AND BRED THEM 
TO GET PUPPIES WHICH HAVE INHERITED CERTAIN QUALITIES FROM EACH PARENT 
THIS IS CALLED SELECTIVE BREEDING 
WHEN PLANTS OR ANIMALS ARE CROSSED TO RETAIN OR EMPHASISE A PARTICULAR FEATURE 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS TINY CHIHUAHUA WHICH WEIGHS ABOUT THE SAME AS A BAG OF SUGAR 
SHARES THE SAME ANCESTOR AS THIS HUGE GREAT DANE WHO WEIGHS THE SAME AS A LARGE PERSON 
THAT COMMON ANCESTOR IS A WOLF 
ALTHOUGH THESE MIGHT LOOK LIKE HUGGABLE PETS ONLY AFTER CENTURIES OF SELECTIVE BREEDING 
HAVE THESE WILD AND FEROCIOUS ANIMALS BEEN TAMED INTO THE DOG WE CAN LIVE WITH 
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS SUBJECT BUT SELECTIVE BREEDING DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO DOGS 
MANY OF OUR DOMESTIC LIVESTOCK FRUIT VEGETABLES AND GRAINS HAVE BEEN SELECTIVELY BRED 
OVER THOUSANDS OF GENERATIONS TO PRODUCE THE DESIRED RESULT 
ALL LIVING THINGS CAN BE SORTED INTO GROUPS AND THE MEMBERS OF EACH GROUP WILL HAVE SIMILAR FEATURES 
THIS PROCESS OF SORTING THINGS INTO GROUPS IS CALLED CLASSIFICATION 
THIS MEANS THAT DIFFERENT SPECIES THAT ARE QUITE SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER CAN BE PUT INTO LARGER GROUPS 
WE CAN FIRST DIVIDE UP ALL LIVING THINGS ON EARTH INTO AN ANIMAL KINGDOM AND A PLANT KINGDOM 
THESE KINGDOMS CAN BE FURTHER SPLIT UP 
FOR KEY STAGE THREE YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE ANIMAL KINGDOM HOW IT IS DIVIDED UP AND WHY 
FIRST IT CAN BE GROUPED INTO TWO BETWEEN ANIMALS THAT DON'T HAVE A BACKBONE INVERTEBRATES 
AND ANIMALS THAT DO VERTEBRATES 
FOR YOUR TEST YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ALL THE NAMES OF THE INVERTEBRATE GROUPS 
IF A QUESTION COMES UP YOU OFTEN GET A TABLE WITH THEIR NAMES 
BUT IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO BE FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE ANIMALS 
INVERTEBRATES CAN BE SPLIT INTO FIVE GROUPS 
INSECTS ARACHNIDS THAT'S SPIDERS AND SCORPIONS 
CRUSTACEANS FOR EXAMPLE LOBSTERS AND WOOD LICE 
MOLLUSCS SUCH AS SNAILS AND MUSSELS 
AND FINALLY ANNELIDS WORMS AND LEECHES 
VERTEBRATES ARE ANIMALS WITH BACKBONES WHICH INCLUDES HUMANS 
YES WE'RE ANIMALS VERTEBRATES ARE SPLIT INTO FIVE MAIN ANIMAL GROUPS ACCORDING TO MAJOR CHARACTERISTICS 
FOR YOUR TEST YOU'LL NEED TO KNOW THESE WELL AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE GROUPS HAVE BEEN DIVIDED UP 
WHY NOT STOP HERE AND SEE IF YOU CAN WRITE DOWN THE FIVE GROUPS 
THE FIVE GROUPS OF VERTEBRATES ARE MAMMALS 
BIRDS 
REPTILES 
AMPHIBIANS 
AND FISH 
WE CAN PUT ALL VERTEBRATES INTO THEIR DIFFERENT GROUPS HUMANS ARE MAMMALS FISH ARE FISH 
WHAT DOES A GOLDFISH AND HIS FRIENDS HAVE IN COMMON WITH OTHER FISH AND WHAT MAKES A HUMAN A MAMMAL 
WHAT DO HUMANS HAVE IN COMMON WITH GIRAFFES MICE AND DOGS 
WHAT DISTINGUISHES US FROM BIRDS LET'S FIND OUT JUST WHAT MAKES A MAMMAL A MAMMAL 
LUCKILY WE CAN PUT VERTEBRATES INTO THEIR DIFFERENT GROUPS JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM 
WE CAN IDENTIFY EACH OF THE FIVE GROUPS BY THEIR EXTERNAL FEATURES 
THIS GROUP OF STUDENTS AT MARWELL ZOO HAVE BEEN SET A CHALLENGE 
TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT MAKES A FROG AN AMPHIBIAN AND A HUMAN A MAMMAL 
THEY HAVE A SET OF CARDS THAT SHOW DIFFERENT ANIMAL FEATURES 
AT THE END OF OUR CHALLENGE WE WILL KNOW JUST WHAT MAKES A MAMMAL A MAMMAL AND A FISH A FISH 
ONE OF THE HEAD KEEPERS AT MARWELL ZOO GEOFF READ IS GOING TO HELP THE STUDENTS ALONG THE WAY 
OH HERE WE GO FISH YEAH 
OH WOW THEY'RE REALLY BIG 
THEY'RE ONE OF THE GROUPS OF VERTEBRATES HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON NOT TOO BAD 
WE THINK WE'VE GOT THE KEY FEATURES OF FISH RIGHT 
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
THAT'S A POT BELLIED PIG YEAH A MAMMAL 
SO NEXT ON TO OUR FEATHERED FRIENDS BIRDS 
IT'S GOT LIKE A MOHICAN HEAD ISN'T THAT COOL THEY'VE GOT RED BEAKS 
HOW ARE WE DOING LOOK AT THEIR FEATHERS IT'S ALL RUFFLED OUT YEAH 
THESE ARE AUSTRALIAN BLACK SWANS THE OTHERS ARE VARIOUS MIXTURES OF DUCKS OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE BIRDS 
HAVE YOU FOUND ANY CHARACTERISTICS YET THEY HAVE BEAKS YEAH 
AND THEY LAY HARD SHELLED EGGS ON LAND YES 
THEY HAVE FEATHERS YEAH THEY ALSO HAVE WINGS THEY DO THAT'S GOOD 
THE KEY CHARACTERISTICS ARE 
FEED YOUNG ON MOTHER'S MILK THAT WOULD BE A MAMMAL DEFINITELY 
AS YOU CAN SEE THESE ARE MAMMALS WHAT CHARACTERISTICS HAVE YOU FOUND FOR MAMMALS 
FEED ON MOTHER'S MILK YES WHICH IT'S DOING IT'S ONLY EIGHT MONTHS OLD 
THEY HAVE HAIR OR FUR THEY DO IT'S NOT OBVIOUS ON THESE 
THE HORN IS MADE OF HAIR SEE THE TINY STRANDS 
YOU CAN FEEL LITTLE HAIRS ALL OVER ITS BODY 
ON TO A MORE TYPICAL MAMMAL A COATI 
THESE ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MAMMALS 
WHAT KEY CHARACTERISTICS HAVE YOU FOUND SO FAR THE YOUNG FEED ON MOTHER'S MILK 
AND THEY HAVE HAIR OR FUR YOU CAN SEE THAT HERE 
ALL MAMMALS 
SMOOTH DAMP SKIN AMPHIBIANS YEAH 
THESE ARE TOMATO FROGS HENCE THE COLOUR 
THEY COME FROM MADAGASCAR WHICH VERTEBRATE GROUP DO THEY BELONG TO 
ARE THEY AMPHIBIANS YES WHAT ARE THE KEY CHARACTERISTICS 
DO THEY HAVE SMOOTH DAMP SKIN YES 
LAY SOFT EGGS IN WATER YES AND DO THEY LIVE ON LAND AND WATER 
YES THAT'S A TRUE AMPHIBIAN 
AND THEY JUMP 
THEY LAY SOFT SHELLED EGGS ON LAND 
REPTILES YEAH 
SO FINALLY WHAT ARE THESE REPTILES 
YEP QUITE RIGHT WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT REPTILES 
IT'S GOT REALLY SMOOTH DRY SKIN 
FEEL IT IT'S GOT A REALLY NICE COLOUR 
THESE COME IN VERY MANY COLOURS 
HAVE YOU SORTED OUT YOUR KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIVE GROUPS YEAH GOOD WELL DONE 
YOU ALL DESERVE A GOOD BREAK NOW 
THE KEY FEATURES OF VERTEBRATES YOU SHOULD KNOW ARE 
THEY ARE WARM BLOODED 
DON'T CONFUSE THEM WITH REPTILES 
THEY'RE COLD BLOODED 
YOU SHOULD KNOW ALL FIVE OF OUR VERTEBRATE GROUPS AND THEIR DISTINGUISHABLE FEATURES 
THIS QUESTION IS WORTH THREE MARKS SO YOU MUST INCLUDE THREE POINTS 
WELL WE CAN RULE OUT MAMMALS NO FUR 
BIRDS NO FEATHERS FISH DOESN'T SPEND ITS ENTIRE TIME IN WATER 
THAT LEAVES REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS HAVE A THINK 
YOUR ANSWER SHOULD SAY THIS 
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE OF YOUR ANSWER YOU CAN REWIND AND GO OVER THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS AGAIN 
SO REMEMBER 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF VARIATION CLASSIFICATION AND INHERITANCE 
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT CAUSES VARIATION YOU CAN RUN THROUGH THIS UNIT AGAIN 
OR STOP NOW AND HAVE A BREAK 
THIS NEXT UNIT LOOKS AT LIVING THINGS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT 
THE FIRST SECTION IS ABOUT HABITATS 
A HABITAT IS THE PARTICULAR TYPE OF AREA WHERE AN ORGANISM LIVES 
WHAT IS YOUR HABITAT LIKE 
WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL FOR YOU HOW DOES IT INFLUENCE YOUR LIFE 
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT HABITATS WHERE PLANTS AND ANIMALS LIVE 
THIS GOLDFISH'S HABITAT IS ITS FISH TANK IT'S AN ARTIFICIAL HABITAT 
BUT IT MIMICS THE REAL ONE A FRESH WATER POND LET'S LOOK AT SOME OTHERS 
A WOODLAND RIVER 
A ROCKY SEA SHORE IN BRITAIN AND THE ANTARCTIC ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF HABITATS 
THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT HABITATS 
THE IMPORTANT POINT TO REMEMBER IS THAT DIFFERENT HABITATS WILL SUPPORT DIFFERENT PLANTS AND ANIMALS 
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HABITATS IN GREAT DETAIL 
BUT YOU DO NEED TO KNOW THERE ARE A WIDE VARIETY OF THEM SUPPORTING DIFFERENT PLANTS AND ANIMALS 
AND YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT ANIMALS AND PLANTS LIVE IN A CERTAIN HABITAT AS THEY'VE ADAPTED TO SURVIVE THERE 
FOR AN ANIMAL OR PLANT TO SURVIVE IT MUST BE WELL ADAPTED TO ITS HABITAT 
IN OTHER WORDS IT HAS SPECIAL FEATURES ADAPTATIONS WHICH MAKE IT SUITED TO WHERE IT LIVES 
HUMANS ARE ADAPTED TO LIVE ON LAND HAVE LUNGS AND BREATHE AIR 
WE ALSO HAVE LIMBS NEEDED FOR MOVEMENT ON THE GROUND 
FISH ARE WELL ADAPTED FOR LIFE IN WATER THEY HAVE GILLS THAT ABSORB OXYGEN DISSOLVED IN THE WATER 
FINS TO PROPEL THEMSELVES AND A STREAMLINED SMOOTH BODY TO GIVE THE LEAST RESISTANCE 
THIS HABITAT A SHORELINE IN BRITAIN SUPPORTS MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES OF BIRDS 
HERE ARE TWO SPECIES OYSTERCATCHER AND AVOCET 
FROM THEIR EXTERNAL FEATURES 
LOOK AT THE BIRDS CAREFULLY ESPECIALLY THEIR FEATURES 
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THEIR BEAKS LENGTH OF LEGS AND OVERALL SIZE 
STOP THE PROGRAMME NOW AND REWIND IF YOU NEED TO GO OVER ANY OF THIS AGAIN 
HERE ARE KEY POINTS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT LIVING THINGS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT 
ANIMALS ARE NOT THE ONLY LIVING THINGS TO ADAPT TO THE ENVIRONMENT 
PLANTS HAVE ALSO EVOLVED TO SURVIVE 
THIS SANDY BEACH MAY NOT BE THE EASIEST PLACE TO LIVE BUT IT'S NOT AS HARSH AS A DESERT 
SOME DESERTS HAVE NO RAIN AT ALL FOR SEVERAL YEARS 
AND MOST ARE EXTREMELY HOT 
A FEW SPECIES OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS HAVE ADAPTED INGENIOUS WAYS OF COPING WITH VERY HARSH CONDITIONS 
WITH HEAT AND LACK OF WATER 
BECAUSE PRECIOUS WATER IS LOST THROUGH LEAVES CACTI HAVE NO FOLIAGE 
JUST SPINES WHICH ALSO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING EATEN 
CACTI STORE WATER IN THEIR THICK FLESHY STEMS 
PLANTS AND ANIMALS ARE ALSO ADAPTED TO SURVIVE SEASONAL AND DAILY CHANGES IN THEIR HABITAT 
SEASONAL CHANGES ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SUMMER AND WINTER SPRING AND AUTUMN 
DAILY CHANGES MEAN THEY RESPOND DIFFERENTLY FROM DAYLIGHT HOURS TO NIGHT TIME MAKE NOTES OF THEM 
ONE EXAMPLE OF DAILY ADAPTATION IS THE WAY FLOWERS CLOSE AT NIGHT 
THEN AS LIGHT APPEARS AND TEMPERATURES RISE THEY OPEN DURING THE DAY 
MANY ANIMALS WILL SLEEP DURING THE DAY TO AVOID PREDATORS AND FEED DURING THE NIGHT 
EXAMPLES OF SEASONAL ADAPTATION ARE TREES WHICH SHED THEIR LEAVES IN WINTER TO REDUCE THE WATER THEY LOSE 
WHEN THE GROUND IS FROZEN 
SOME MAMMALS INCREASE THE THICKNESS OF THEIR COAT AS WINTER APPROACHES 
AND WHEN FOOD IS SCARCE IN WINTER SOME ANIMALS HIBERNATE 
DURING SUMMER MONTHS THE SKIN OF HUMANS DARKENS ON EXPOSURE TO SUNLIGHT TO PROTECT THEM 
FROM INCREASED ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION 
SO FOR ALL ANIMALS AND PLANTS TO SURVIVE OVER TIME THEY HAVE BECOME WELL ADAPTED TO THEIR HABITAT 
AND SOME ORGANISMS ARE ALSO ADAPTED TO DAILY AND SEASONAL CHANGES 
LIFE IS A STRUGGLE IT MIGHT NOT BE OBVIOUS BUT ALL PLANTS AND ANIMALS ARE WELL ADAPTED TO THEIR HABITAT 
ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT A HABITAT IS TO SEE WHAT IS EATING WHAT 
IN OTHER WORDS THE FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE SPECIES 
THESE CAN BE SUMMARISED IN A FOOD CHAIN THIS IS A REALLY KEY CONCEPT THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 
SO WATCH THIS NEXT CLIP CAREFULLY 
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A FOOD CHAIN 
ENERGY FROM THE SUN IS STORED IN PLANTS SNAILS EAT THE PLANTS 
THEN THEY GET EATEN BY SMALL BIRDS 
SMALLER BIRDS ARE EATEN BY LARGER BIRDS OF PREY 
WOW WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE 
THIS HAS BEEN WRECKED BY SLUGS AND SNAILS LOOK THEY'VE HAD A REAL BANQUET 
INCREDIBLE I CAN SEE WHY THEIR NUMBERS MUST BE CONTROLLED 
THE PROBLEM IS MOST PEOPLE USE SLUG PELLETS AND THEY KILL FAR TOO MANY SLUGS AND SNAILS 
BUT BIRDS DEPEND ON SLUGS FOR THEIR FOOD LOTS OF BIRDS LOVE SLUGS THRUSHES ARE EXPERT SNAIL KILLERS 
IF THERE ARE FEWER SLUGS AND SNAILS THAT'S LESS FOOD FOR THOSE BIRDS 
YEP IT'S NOT JUST BIRDS THEY'RE IMPORTANT IN OTHER FOOD CHAINS 
SO HEDGEHOGS BIRDS THEY DEPEND ON SLUGS AND SNAILS BUT THERE ARE OTHER ANIMALS TOO 
FROGS TOADS SLOW WORMS BADGERS 
AND THEY'RE ALL PART OF THEIR OWN FOOD CHAINS 
YOU HAVE PLANT SLUG THEN FROG OR BADGER OR TOAD 
THE SIMPLE CHAIN GETS MORE COMPLEX 
SO WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS A WHOLE LOAD OF FOOD CHAINS ALL DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER 
IT'S A BIT LIKE A WEB 
SO OUR SIMPLE CHAIN HAS GONE 
PLANTS ARE STILL THE FIRST LEVEL 
BUT NOW SLUGS AND SNAILS ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A WEB 
WITH THESE THINGS DEPENDENT ON THEM 
AND THESE DEPENDENT ON THOSE THINGS FOXES OWLS CROWS 
IF THERE AREN'T ENOUGH SLUGS AND SNAILS EVERYTHING ELSE IS AFFECTED 
THE ARROWS REPRESENT THE ENERGY FLOW ALONG THE FOOD CHAIN 
REMEMBER THE ARROWS ALWAYS GO FROM FOOD TO FEEDER 
A VERY COMMON MISTAKE IS TO PUT THE ARROW THE WRONG WAY ROUND 
COPY THIS ONE DOWN AND TRY PUTTING THE ARROWS IN 
YOUR ARROWS SHOULD HAVE GONE FROM THE FOOD TO THE FEEDER 
FOOD CHAINS GIVE US A GOOD IDEA OF SOME OF THE FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS IN A HABITAT 
BUT DON'T GIVE US ANY IDEA ABOUT NUMBERS OF EACH SPECIES 
FOR EXAMPLE HOW MANY SLUGS OR HEDGEHOGS ARE IN AN ENVIRONMENT 
KNOWING THE NUMBERS OF ANIMALS OR PLANTS IN AN AREA WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND THE HABITAT BETTER 
THIS IS DONE WITH A PYRAMID OF NUMBERS 
THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THE FOX GETS FROM ONE RABBIT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR IT TO LIVE 
ONE FOX EATS SEVENTY RABBITS TO LIVE A YEAR 
HOW MUCH DID THE SEVENTY RABBITS EAT TO LIVE 
TWENTY THOUSAND BLADES OF GRASS 
WE NOW HAVE ANOTHER WAY TO SHOW THE DECREASING ENERGY BEING TRANSFERRED FROM THE START OF THE FOOD CHAIN 
TO THE END 
TWENTY THOUSAND BLADES OF GRASS SUPPORTS SEVENTY RABBITS WHICH SUPPORT ONE FOX 
THIS IS A PYRAMID OF NUMBERS 
AS IT SUGGESTS A PYRAMID OF NUMBERS USUALLY FORMS A PYRAMID SHAPE 
WHICH REPRESENTS THE DECREASING NUMBERS OR ORGANISMS AS YOU GO UP THE FOOD CHAIN 
THERE ARE ALWAYS EXCEPTIONS LOOK AT THE FOOD CHAIN WE SAW EARLIER 
START WITH THE SLUGS' FOOD LETTUCE 
THE FOOD CHAIN IS LETTUCE SLUG MISTLE THRUSH HAWK 
IF WE MAKE THIS FOOD CHAIN INTO A PYRAMID OF NUMBERS WE HAVE 
THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE LETTUCES ARE LARGE COMPARED TO SLUGS 
ONE LETTUCE CAN FEED FIVE SLUGS 
HERE ARE SOME MORE DEFINITIONS OF RELATIONSHIPS IN FOOD CHAINS 
TO SUM UP THIS SECTION ALL LIVING THINGS LIVE IN A HABITAT 
AND LIFE IS A STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL 
ONLY PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT ADAPT WELL CAN COMPETE FOR RESOURCES AND PRODUCE LOTS OF OFFSPRING 
THIS BRINGS US TO THE END OF THE BIOLOGY SECTION OF THIS PROGRAMME 
WE NOW MOVE ON TO CHEMISTRY SO IT'S A GOOD PLACE FOR A BREAK 
WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO CHEMISTRY 
THE FIRST TWO UNITS OF CHEMISTRY ARE IN THIS PROGRAMME THE OTHER THREE ARE IN THE NEXT PROGRAMME 
TOGETHER WITH SOME PHYSICS UNITS 
WHEN YOU'RE GETTING TO GRIPS WITH CHEMISTRY TRY TO IMAGINE WHAT THE PARTICLES IN A SUBSTANCE ARE DOING 
ALL WILL BE REVEALED IN THE NEXT SECTION CLASSIFYING MATERIAL 
MATTER IS ALL AROUND US IT'S THE WORD USED TO DESCRIBE EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS 
EVERY SUBSTANCE IS MADE OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF MATTER 
YOU NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT SUBSTANCES CAN EXIST IN THREE DIFFERENT STATES OF MATTER SOLID LIQUID 
AND GAS 
FOR INSTANCE HERE WATER IS IN ALL THREE STATES 
A COLD DRINK HAS ICE AND WATER SOLID AND LIQUID STATES 
A CUP OF TEA IS ALSO IN THE LIQUID STATE BUT THE STEAM FROM THE KETTLE IS A MIXTURE OF TINY WATER DROPLETS 
AND WATER VAPOUR THE GAS 
IN EACH YOU ARE LOOKING AT WATER TEMPERATURE MAKES THE DIFFERENCE 
THE TEMPERATURE CAUSES A CHANGE OF STATE WE'LL LOOK AT THAT NEXT 
WHEN A SUBSTANCE CHANGES STATE WE SAY A PHYSICAL CHANGE TAKES PLACE 
IF A SOLID SUBSTANCE IS HEATED TO PRODUCE A LIQUID IT CAN BE COOLED AND RETURNED TO ITS SOLID STATE 
HERE SOLID PARAFFIN WAX IS BEING HEATED AND YOU CAN SEE IT QUICKLY BECOMES A TRANSPARENT LIQUID 
EVEN THOUGH A SUBSTANCE LOOKS AND BEHAVES DIFFERENTLY IN ITS DIFFERENT STATE IT'S CHEMICALLY THE SAME 
LET'S LOOK AT SOME OTHER EXAMPLES 
ANOTHER GAS IN THE AIR IS OXYGEN 
LIKE CARBON DIOXIDE IT'S INVISIBLE 
USUALLY 
OXYGEN GAS PASSES THROUGH THIS TUBE INTO A COPPER PIPE 
THE BUCKET CONTAINS LIQUID NITROGEN 
AT MINUS ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX DEGREES CELSIUS 
VERY COLD INDEED 
AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF COOLING LOOK AT THE END OF THE PIPE DROPS OF LIQUID 
IT'S SO COLD THAT THE OXYGEN GAS PASSING THROUGH THE TUBE BECOMES A LIQUID 
IT CONDENSES 
IN THIS TUBE THERE'S A SOLID BROMINE 
THIS IS LIQUID BROMINE 
AND NOW THE TUBE IS FILLING WITH BROWN GAS BROMINE AGAIN 
THE SAME STUFF BUT IN TOTALLY DIFFERENT FORMS' 
WE'RE NOT USED TO SEEING OXYGEN AS A LIQUID 
IT'S ALWAYS A GAS IN THE TEMPERATURE RANGE WE LIVE IN 
WE'RE USED TO SEEING SUBSTANCES IN ONE PARTICULAR STATE 
METALS FOR INSTANCE ARE USUALLY SOLID BUT LOOK AT THE NEXT CLIP 
AS THE TEMPERATURE RISES SOLIDS BECOME LIQUIDS THEY MELT 
EVEN IN HERE IT'S WARM ENOUGH FOR ONE PARTICULAR METAL TO BE LIQUID MERCURY IN THE THERMOMETER 
A LIQUID METAL AT ROOM TEMPERATURE 
YOU MIGHT THINK THAT METALS ARE SOLIDS BUT LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE 
METALS CAN BE LIQUIDS AND GASES TOO 
THIS COIN IS MADE OF GALLIUM IT'S A SOLID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE 
BUT GALLIUM METAL MELTS AT THIRTY DEGREES 
MY HAND IS WARM ENOUGH TO MELT IT 
IN A TEST PAPER YOU WILL OFTEN BE ASKED ABOUT THE BOILING MELTING AND FREEZING POINTS OF SUBSTANCES 
LET'S RUN THROUGH A TYPICAL EXPERIMENT 
WE CAN ADD A THERMOMETER TO A BEAKER FULL OF CRUSHED ICE READ IT EVERY MINUTE 
AND PLOT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ICE AGAINST TIME 
YOU CAN THEN PLOT A GRAPH OF THE TEMPERATURE RISES OVER FIFTEEN MINUTES 
THESE GRAPHS OFTEN APPEAR IN TEST PAPERS SO MAKE SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THEIR LAYOUT 
THIS IS A GRAPH FOR WATER 
YOU CAN SEE THE MELTING POINT M. P. WHERE THE SOLID BECOMES A LIQUID 
AND THEN AT A HIGHER TEMPERATURE ONE HUNDRED DEGREES CELSIUS 
THE BOILING POINT B. P. WHERE IT CHANGES FROM LIQUID TO GAS 
IF WE LOOK AT ANOTHER SUBSTANCE THE PATTERN IS SIMILAR 
BUT THE SUBSTANCE HAS DIFFERENT MELTING AND BOILING POINTS 
TO EXPLAIN THE PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS LIQUIDS AND GASES 
AND HOW THEY CHANGE FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WE CAN USE 
THIS IS ONE OF THE KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS YOU NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND WELL 
WE'LL GO THROUGH IT STEP BY STEP 
IN A SOLID PARTICLES ARE CLOSELY PACKED AND HELD TIGHTLY TOGETHER 
THEY'RE NOT COMPLETELY STILL JUST VIBRATING VERY GENTLY 
THIS EXPLAINS WHY SOLIDS HAVE A RIGID STRUCTURE AND FIXED SHAPE AND ARE HARD TO COMPRESS 
THE PARTICLES IN A LIQUID ARE ALSO CLOSELY PACKED 
BUT THEY MOVE OVER EACH OTHER LIQUIDS TAKEN ON THE SHAPE OF THEIR CONTAINER ARE HARD TO COMPRESS 
FLOW EASILY AND HAVE A FIXED VOLUME 
IN GASES THE PARTICLES ARE NOT CLOSELY PACKED 
THEY ARE SPACED OUT AND MOVE AROUND VERY QUICKLY THEY ALSO TAKE THE SHAPE OF THEIR CONTAINER 
BUT THEY ARE EASY TO COMPRESS AND FLOW READILY UNLIKE LIQUIDS 
THEY HAVE THE VOLUME OF THE CONTAINER 
NOTICE HOW THIS QUESTION USES THE WORD EXPLAIN 
YOU NEED TO DESCRIBE A PROPERTY AND THEN EXPLAIN IT FOR THE SECOND MARK 
STOP THE PROGRAMME AND HAVE A GO AT THE QUESTION YOURSELF 
YOU COULD SAY THAT LIQUIDS FLOW AND HAVE NO FIXED SHAPE 
THE SECOND MARK WOULD BE GIVEN FOR SAYING BECAUSE THE PARTICLES CAN MOVE OVER EACH OTHER 
IF YOU SAY THEY'RE HARD TO COMPRESS 
THE SECOND MARK IS FOR SAYING BECAUSE THE PARTICLES ARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER OR TOUCHING 
WE USE BECAUSE TO LINK THE TWO PARTS OF THE ANSWER 
DON'T FORGET ALL THE EQUIPMENT YOU NEED FOR THE EXAM 
A PEN PROBABLY A SPARE PEN 
A PENCIL CALCULATOR A RUBBER A RULER AND A PROTRACTOR 
YOU NEED TO TAKE ALL OF THOSE IN A CLEAR PENCIL CASE 
IF YOU LEAVE A GLASS OF WATER IN A ROOM OVER SEVERAL DAYS 
THE WATER LEVEL WILL GO DOWN IT EVAPORATES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE 
LET'S LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT WHAT THE PARTICLES ARE DOING 
AT ANY TEMPERATURE WHEN WATER IS LIQUID SOME WATER PARTICLES ALWAYS MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO ESCAPE 
THEY MOVE FROM THE SURFACE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND THIS IS CALLED EVAPORATION 
THE RATE OF EVAPORATION IS FASTER AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES 
THE WARMER IT IS THE FASTER PARTICLES MOVE 
WHICH MEANS MORE ESCAPE FROM THE SURFACE 
THE OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE RATE OF EVAPORATION ARE THE AMOUNT OF WATER VAPOUR ALREADY IN THE AIR 
AND THE SPEED AT WHICH THE AIR MOVES PAST THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID 
HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION WHERE YOU HAVE TO USE THE PARTICLE MODEL 
THE OPPOSITE OF EVAPORATION IS CONDENSATION 
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK 
REMEMBER CONDENSATION IS THE OPPOSITE OF EVAPORATION 
IT'S WHEN A GAS BECOMES A LIQUID 
HERE WATER VAPOUR COMES INTO CONTACT WITH A MUCH COLDER SURFACE AND TURNS BACK INTO TINY WATER DROPLETS 
PARTICLES IN THE GAS HAVE LESS ENERGY BECAUSE OF THE LOWER TEMPERATURE SO MOVE MORE SLOWLY 
AND EVENTUALLY GATHER TOGETHER TO FORM A LIQUID IT'S HOW CLOUDS FORM AND CONDENSATION APPEARS ON WINDOWS 
THIS COMPLETES THE FIRST UNIT OF CHEMISTRY ON CLASSIFYING MATERIAL 
MAKE SURE YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND THE PARTICLE MODEL AND CAN USE IT TO DESCRIBE HOW SOLIDS LIQUIDS 
AND GASES BEHAVE REWIND THIS SECTION IF YOU NEED TO GO OVER IT AGAIN DON'T FORGET TO TAKE A BREAK 
ALL MATERIALS EVERYTHING AROUND US ARE MADE UP OF CHEMICALS AND CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS LIVING OR NON LIVING 
RANGING FROM COMPLEX STRUCTURES LIKE OURSELVES TO WHAT LOOK LIKE SIMPLER THINGS LIKE PAPER AND PLASTIC 
EVERYTHING IS MADE UP OF CHEMICALS 
YOU NEED TO KNOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMICALS AND THEIR PROPERTIES 
CHEMICALS AREN'T JUST THINGS YOU FIND IN LABS 
EVERYTHING AROUND YOU IS MADE UP OF CHEMICALS 
THIS CAKE IS MADE FROM ALL THESE INGREDIENTS 
BUT WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS MADE OUT OF 
THEY'RE ALL MADE OUT OF CHEMICALS CALLED ELEMENTS 
ELEMENTS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF EVERYTHING AROUND US 
THIS LOT DON'T LOOK VERY TASTY IN FACT SOME OF THESE ELEMENTS ARE TOXIC AND DANGEROUS 
SO WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT ELEMENTS 
THEY'RE PURE SUBSTANCES AND CANNOT BE SPLIT UP INTO SIMPLER SUBSTANCES 
ALL ELEMENTS ARE MADE UP OF TINY PARTICLES CALLED ATOMS 
AND EACH ELEMENT IS ONLY MADE UP OF ONE TYPE OF ATOM 
ELEMENTS CAN BE REPRESENTED BY A SYMBOL AND YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF THE MOST COMMON ONES 
N. FOR NITROGEN O. FOR OXYGEN 
FE FOR IRON 
HG FOR MERCURY 
S. FOR SULPHUR 
C. U. FOR COPPER 
AND C. FOR CARBON 
AT ROOM TEMPERATURE ELEMENTS CAN BE SOLID LIQUID OR GAS 
SO NITROGEN AND OXYGEN GASES LOOK VERY DIFFERENT 
FROM THE ELEMENTS COPPER AND CARBON SOLIDS 
WE SEE VERY FEW PURE ELEMENTS IN EVERYDAY LIFE 
HERE'S MERCURY IN A THERMOMETER 
SILVER AND GOLD JEWELLERY 
AND HELIUM GAS FILLING A BALLOON 
ELEMENTS ARE RARELY SEEN BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN COMBINED IN CHEMICAL REACTIONS TO FORM COMPOUNDS 
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE COMBINE SODIUM AND CHLORINE GAS 
ELEMENTS ARE MADE UP OF TINY PARTICLES TOO SMALL TO SEE WITH THE NAKED EYE 
PARTICLES OF ONE ELEMENT ARE ALL THE SAME 
IMAGINE THESE ARE PARTICLES OF THE ELEMENT SODIUM 
CHLORINE PARTICLES ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM SODIUM PARTICLES 
BUT WHEN PARTICLES OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS GET TOGETHER TWO THINGS CAN HAPPEN 
THEY CAN BE MIXED TOGETHER BUT KEEP THEIR OWN CHARACTERISTICS AND ARE EASILY SEPARATED 
OR THEY CAN JOIN TOGETHER CHEMICALLY 
THEY'RE MUCH HARDER TO SEPARATE NOW THE CHEMICAL COMBINATION IS CALLED A COMPOUND 
A COMPOUND CAN BE REPRESENTED BY A CHEMICAL FORMULA 
MIXTURES ARE MADE UP OF PARTICLES OF SUBSTANCES NOT JOINED TOGETHER IN A CHEMICAL REACTION 
HERE IS A MIXTURE OF SULPHUR AND IRON THEY HAVE NOT REACTED CHEMICALLY AND ARE SEPARATED EASILY 
THE IRON IS MAGNETIC AND CAN BE EASILY CONNECTED UP USING A MAGNET 
NOTICE HOW THE QUESTION SIMPLY ASKS YOU TO DESCRIBE THE CHANGES 
NOT TO EXPLAIN THEM 
HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO MARKS ONE FOR EACH CORRECT PREDICTION 
THE BEST PREDICTIONS ARE 
STALACTITES ARE FORMED BY DRIPPING WATER OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
THE DRIP OF WATER DRIES UP AND LEAVES BEHIND TINY CRYSTALS OF CALCIUM CARBONATE 
THAT'S A COMPOUND AH SO ALREADY WE KNOW THE LOCAL WATER MUST CONTAIN CALCIUM 
AND THE BAND OF ORANGE ON THE WALL INDICATES IRON IN THE WATER 
SO THAT COULD BE IN THE WATER TOO CORRECT 
ALAN SHOWED ME EXAMPLES OF OTHER SUBSTANCES LIKE MANGANESE LEFT BEHIND BY THE WATER 
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE COULD BE MUCH MORE THAN JUST THE ELEMENTS HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN IN THE LOCAL WATER 
THIS IS THE LAB WHERE THE LOCAL WATER IS TESTED KAREN HERE DOES IT 
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT HERE I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED 
THE LOCALS CALL THIS WATER PURE THE LEAFLETS CALL IT PURE 
EVEN THE BOTTLE CLAIMS IT'S PURE AND YET IT LOOKS LIKELY THAT IT DOES ACTUALLY CONTAIN CALCIUM 
IRON AND MANGANESE YES YOU'RE RIGHT TO BE CONFUSED 
EVERYDAY USE OF THE WORD PURE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE SCIENTIFIC USE 
THIS SAMPLE OF WATER IS A MIXTURE OF WATER AND THOSE MINERALS YOU MENTIONED 
PURE WATER CONTAINS THE ELEMENTS HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN 
SO WHERE CAN I FIND PURE WATER SCIENTIFICALLY PURE 
TAKE THIS SAMPLE FOR STARTERS I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT WE CAN DO 
KAREN HEATS UP THE MINERAL WATER TILL IT STARTS TO BOIL 
THE MINERALS IN THE WATER CAN'T BOIL OFF BUT THE PURE WATER CAN 
THE PURE WATER VAPOUR PASSES UP THROUGH THIS TUBE 
THE TUBE IS KEPT VERY COOL SO THE WATER VAPOUR CONDENSES 
AND WATER TRICKLES OUT THE END SCIENTIFICALLY PURE WATER 
BUT WHEN ALL THE WATER'S BOILED AWAY WHAT'S LEFT IN THE FLASK 
YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE TRACES OF MINERALS LEFT BEHIND ON THE SIDE OF THE FLASK 
SO SCIENTIFICALLY THE MINERAL WATER IS NO MORE PURE THAN MY FIZZY DRINKS NO THEY'RE MIXTURES TOO 
BUT THAT IS PURE WATER YES THIS IS PURE WATER IT'S ACTUALLY TASTELESS 
MINERALS GIVE WATER ITS UNIQUE TASTE 
I THINK I'LL STICK TO THE NATURAL BUT NOT SCIENTIFICALLY PURE BUXTON WATER CHEERS 
SO ORDINARY WATER THAT WE DRINK AND USE FOR EVERYDAY PURPOSES IS A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MINERALS 
THAT ARE DISSOLVED INTO IT WE CAN GET PURE WATER BY DISTILLATION 
BUT THAT'S IN THE NEXT SECTION WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT 
IN CHEMISTRY MIXTURES OFTEN NEED TO BE SEPARATED 
WE'LL LOOK AT SEPARATION TECHNIQUES 
THERE ARE FIVE SEPARATION TECHNIQUES YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR YOUR TEST 
YOU ALSO NEED TO KNOW WHEN TO USE EACH ONE 
IN THIS NEXT CLIP SEVERAL TECHNIQUES ARE USED TO SEPARATE SALT FROM ROCK SALT 
TRY WRITING DOWN THE ONES YOU SEE 
IT'S THE ONLY ROCK SALT MINE IN THE U. K. 
AND IT'S ENORMOUS 
ROUND THE CORNER THERE'S SOMEONE TO HELP ME 
HI GEORGE I'VE COLLECTED MY ROCK SALT SAMPLE FOR ANALYSIS WHAT DO I DO WELL DONE 
PUT IT NICELY ON THE WEIGHING PAPER 
TAKE ONE HUNDRED GRAMS OF FRESH CRUSHED ROCK SALT 
ADD WATER AND MIX WELL FOR TWO AND A HALF HOURS 
THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT OF COURSE THE CLAY DOES NOT 
POUR THE MIXTURE THROUGH A FILTER 
THE CLEAR SALT SOLUTION PASSES STRAIGHT THROUGH INTO THE FLASK 
BUT THE BROWN CLAY PARTICLES ARE TOO BIG TO GET THROUGH THE FILTER PAPER 
HEAT THE SALT SOLUTION 
THE WATER EVAPORATES AND THE SALT IS LEFT BEHIND 
BY SUBTRACTING THE WEIGHT OF AN IDENTICAL EMPTY BEAKER FROM THE WEIGHT OF MY SALTY ONE 
I CAN CALCULATE I HAVE NINE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT GRAMS OF SALT 
SO WHAT SEPARATION TECHNIQUES DID YOU COME UP WITH 
YOU SHOULD HAVE COME UP WITH TWO SEPARATION PROCESSES 
THE CLAY AND SALT WERE FIRST SEPARATED BY FILTRATION 
AND SECONDLY EVAPORATION 
THE SALT SOLUTION WAS HEATED THE WATER TURNED TO WATER VAPOUR 
AND THE SOLID SALT WAS LEFT BEHIND 
BUT IF YOU HAD A SALT SOLUTION AND THIS TIME YOU WANTED TO KEEP THE LIQUID AND NOT THE SOLID THE SALT 
THE SEPARATION PROCESS NEEDED IS DIFFERENT 
YOU MAY WISH TO SEPARATE A SOLUTION OF SALT WATER AND KEEP THE WATER 
THE SOLUTION IS HEATED IN THE SAME WAY BUT THE WATER VAPOUR OR STEAM IS TRAPPED 
AND CHANNELLED INTO ANOTHER CONTAINER WHERE IT COOLS AND RETURNS TO LIQUID 
SEPARATING A SOLUTION IN THIS WAY IS CALLED DISTILLATION 
NEXT FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION 
IF A MIXTURE OF LIQUIDS NEEDS TO BE SEPARATED OUT LIKE THIS CRUDE OIL 
FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION IS USED 
THE DIFFERENT LIQUIDS HAVE DIFFERENT BOILING POINTS 
AS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CRUDE OIL RISES EACH LIQUID REACHES ITS BOILING POINT VAPORISES 
AND CONDENSES BACK AGAIN INTO LIQUID 
THE NEXT CLIP LOOKS AT ANOTHER SEPARATION TECHNIQUE CHROMATOGRAPHY 
INK IS A MIXTURE OF COLOURED DYES DISSOLVED IN WATER 
THE MIXTURE OR SOLUTION CAN BE SEPARATED TO SHOW WHICH COLOURS IT CONTAINS 
IT'S THEN POSSIBLE TO FIND OUT WHAT KIND OF INK WAS USED 
THE WRITING ON THIS PIECE OF CARD LOOKS AS THOUGH IT WAS DRAWN WITH ONE KIND OF BLACK INK 
WE CAN TEST THIS BY TAKING A SAMPLE OF THE INK USED FOR EACH LETTER 
AND PLACING IT ON A SPECIAL PAPER THAT ACTS LIKE BLOTTING PAPER 
THE DISH CONTAINS A SMALL AMOUNT OF CHEMICAL IN THE FORM OF A LIQUID THAT WILL DISSOLVE THE INK 
BY LEAVING THE PAPER TO STAND IN THE DISH THE LIQUID WILL GRADUALLY SOAK INTO IT AND MOVE UPWARDS 
THE LIQUID CAUSES THE DYES IN THE INK TO MOVE WITH IT UP THE PAPER 
AS SOME DYES MOVE FASTER THAN OTHERS THEY START TO SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER 
SHOWING THE DIFFERENT COLOURS IN THE INK 
THE PATTERNS THAT LOOK THE SAME WERE WRITTEN IN THE SAME INK 
THE DIFFERENT PATTERNS SHOW THAT MORE THAN ONE INK WAS USED 
SEPARATING INK DYES IN THIS WAY IS CALLED CHROMATOGRAPHY 
THAT'S THE END OF THIS SECTION 
MY TOP TIP IS TO ASK YOUR PARENTS OR FRIENDS TO QUESTION YOU ON THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THIS SCIENCE PROGRAMME IN THE KEY STAGE THREE BITESIZE REVISION SERIES 
OTHER PROGRAMMES COVER MORE CHEMISTRY AND ALL OF THE PHYSICS THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR TESTS
