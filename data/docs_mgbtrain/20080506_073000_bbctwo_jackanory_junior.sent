THIS IS JACKANORY JUNIOR 
HELLO I'M SHERIDAN 
THIS IS THE STORY OF A VERY HAPPY DOG CALLED HAROLD 
A VERY ANNOYING CAT CALLED PUD AND THE DUCK WHO CAME TO STAY 
IT'S CALLED HAROLD AND THE DUCK 
OVER THE HILLS BUT NOT SO VERY FAR AWAY WAS HAROLD'S FARM 
THERE WERE YELLOW MOONS IN THE NIGHTS AND WOOLLY MEATS 
SHEEP TO YOU AND ME IN THE MEADOWS A COBBLED COURTYARD 
AND AN OLD WEATHER VANE TELLING THE WIND WHICH WAY TO BLOW 
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT MY FARM HAROLD USED TO SAY TO HIMSELF 
WHY EVEN THE WIND DOES AS IT'S TOLD 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE PROBLEM IN HAROLD'S LIFE 
AND THAT WAS A STRAY CAT THIS CAT WENT BY THE NAME OF PUD PUD 
PUD WAS NEVER ALLOWED INTO THE KITCHEN UNTIL HAROLD HAD GONE TO BED 
PUD DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT SORT OF ACCEPTED IT 
IT WAS PART OF THE RULES 
AND SO ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT 
ALL WAS APPARENTLY WELL 
PUD HAD BEEN FED AND HAROLD WAS ASLEEP IN HIS BASKET 
IN THE COURTYARD SILENT BUT FOR THE OWLS 
STARLIGHT MADE SILHOUETTES OF THE BARNS 
AND IT WAS HERE IN THE DARKNESS OF ONE OF THE CORN BINS 
THAT SOMETHING OF CONSEQUENCE HAPPENED AN EGG WAS LAID 
IT WAS A PALE EGG WITH NOTHING VERY SPECIAL ABOUT IT 
EXCEPT THAT BY DAWN IT HAD BEEN ABANDONED BY ITS MOTHER 
AND BY BREAKFAST TIME DISCOVERED BY HAROLD 
WHAT HAS HE GOT DEMANDED WILLOW 
A MUDDY LITTLE BLOKE WITH A POPGUN AND BIG BLUE EYES 
OBVIOUS ISN'T IT SAID HIS SISTER LILY ITS MOTHER'S GONE 
AND I'M GOING TO HATCH IT 
WITHIN A VERY SHORT WHILE SHE'D CREATED A NEST 
OUT OF A COLANDER AND A BOBBLE HAT 
COVERING THE EGG WITH STRAW SHE TRANSFERRED HER INVENTION 
TO THE BASEMENT OF AN OLD STOVE WHERE THE DISHES USUALLY WARM 
IT'S TOO HOT IN THERE YOU'LL COOK IT SAID WILLOW 
WE'LL JUST WAIT AND SEE WON'T WE SAID LILY AND THEY DID WAIT 
AND AFTER A FEW DAYS WHAT THEY SAW OR HEARD WAS A TAPPING 
INSIDE THE EGG SUDDENLY THERE WAS A LOUD CRACK 
FOLLOWED BY A FOOT AND A YELLOW FACE WITH EYES LIKE MATCH HEADS 
EXPECTING SOME SORT OF CHICKEN HAROLD BLINKED 
IT WASN'T THE COLOUR OF A CHICKEN FLUFFY LIKE A CHICKEN 
BUT IT WASN'T A CHICKEN IT WAS A DUCK 
AIN'T HE SWEET SAID LILY I'M GOING TO CALL HIM DUCK 
HAROLD STOOD THERE WAGGING IT TILL IT NEARLY FLEW OFF 
BUT BARELY GOT A PAT HE WAS MIFFED AT THE ATTENTION DUCK WAS GETTING 
CUDDLES WERE SUDDENLY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN 
GOING DOWN AND DOWN AS THE DUCK GREW AND GREW 
IT SEEMED TO GROW OVERNIGHT LIKE A MUSHROOM 
IN HAROLD'S VIEW IT WAS A HORRIBLE LOOKING BIRD 
WITH A TUFT OF FEATHERS ON ITS HEAD LIKE A TOOTHBRUSH 
AND WORSE IT SLEPT IN THE KITCHEN WITH A LAMP TO KEEP IT WARM 
NOBODY CONSIDERED THE SIDE EFFECTS THIS KEPT HAROLD AWAKE 
NO MATTER HOW HE TURNED HE COULDN'T NOD 
NOT EVEN BY SMELLING THE UNWASHED SOCK HE'D HAD SINCE HE WAS A PUP 
THERE WAS ONE CONSOLATION WITHIN A WEEK THIS DUCK WOULD BE LIVING 
OUTSIDE WITH THE REST OF THEM AND WOULD BE GONE 
TWO WEEKS LATER THE DUCK WAS TWICE THE SIZE 
AND HAD TAKEN OVER THE ENTIRE KITCHEN 
SWAGGERING AND QUACKING LIKE IT OWNED THE PLACE 
IT WAS SELF CENTRED RUDE AND ARROGANT 
IT GOT CORN FOR BREAKFAST AND FLICKED IT ALL OVER THE ROOM 
NOT CONTENT WITH ITS OWN BOWL IT GOT ITS BEAK INTO HAROLD'S 
AND THREW HIS MEAT IN THE AIR 
IT WAS ALL TOO MUCH AND COULDN'T GO ON 
SOMEHOW THIS DUCK HAD TO GO 
NEXT MORNING HAROLD FINISHED HIS FIRST SESSION OF BARKING IN THE YARD 
THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WANTED BARKING AT 
MOST OF IT WAS PASSING TRACTORS AND CHICKEN WORK 
AND SOMETIMES OF COURSE THE PUD 
PUD HAD BEEN TAKING AN INTEREST IN HAROLD'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DUCK 
AND HE WAS WATCHING BY THE BACK DOOR AS THE WIRY ONE HAROLD 
REAPPEARED TO FIND THE DUCK STANDING IN HIS BOWL OF WATER 
LIKE IT WAS A POND WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY BOWL 
QUACK YOU ARROGANT DUCK 
UNTIL NOW HAROLD WAS UNAWARE OF THE PUD 
AND THERE'S THAT VEXED BAG OF A CAT HE WOOFED 
FULL OF MICE AND SMIRKING HE WENT AFTER PUD LIKE A BULLET 
OUT IN THE YARD KICKING DUST INTO THE BARN UP THE STAIRS THEY WENT 
AND DOWN THE OTHER ONES 
ROUND AND ROUND THE CORN BINS WITH HAROLD TOO PUFFED FOR THREATS 
PUD WAS A TAIL AWAY RUSHING INTO THE DARKNESS 
WHEN HAROLD REALISED HIS LEGS WERE STILL GOING 
BUT HE WASN'T GOING ANYWHERE 
HE WAS STUFFED INTO AN ABANDONED PIPE LIKE A CORK 
ONLY HIS HEAD STUCK OUT STARING AT PUD NONCHALANTLY PREENING ITSELF 
NOT LIKE YOU TO FALL FOR AN OLD TRICK LIKE THAT HAROLD 
WOOF SAID HAROLD YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAID THE PUD 
WITH A KIND OF CREAMY SMILE YOU ARE AS DOPEY AS THE DUCK 
WOOF SAID HAROLD IN EXASPERATION 
OH WOOF TO YOU SAID PUD MIMICKING HIM 
WOOF WOOF WOOF BUT IT DOESN'T GET YOU ANYWHERE 
D'YOU THINK I'D LET A DUCK GET THE BETTER OF ME 
I'D HAVE THAT OVERGROWN CHRISTMAS DINNER OUT IN A SECOND 
HOW SAID HAROLD STILL BICYCLING WITH HIS BACK FEET 
MY ADVICE HAROLD IS WHEN YOU'RE STUCK BE IT WITH A HOLE OR A DUCK 
YOU'D BETTER STOP PUSHING AND USE YOUR BRAINS 
AND WITH THAT THE PUD SLUNK AWAY INTO A GALAXY OF BUTTERCUPS 
HAROLD WOOFED AFTER HIM BUT GAVE UP 
THEN GRADUALLY WHAT THE PUD SAID MADE SENSE 
WHAT IF HE STOPPED PUSHING AND BICYCLED HIS FEET 
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION SUDDENLY 
HE WAS OUT HE LANDED ON THE BARN FLOOR WITH A BUMP 
HE TRIED TO THINK OF SOMETHING WITH HIS BRAIN BUT IT FELT DOPEY 
THE ONLY THING HE COULD THINK ABOUT WAS HOW MUCH HE DISLIKED THE DUCK 
BACK AT THE HOUSE THE KITCHEN WAS AS MESSY AS IT HAD EVER BEEN 
BUT HAROLD IGNORED IT AND TRIED TO HAVE IT OUT ONE TO ONE WITH THE DUCK 
HE TOLD HIM WHAT'S WHAT AND WHO'S WHO 
THE DUCK PECKED HIM AND GOT HIS SOCK THE SOCK WAS OF IMPORTANCE TO HAROLD 
AND HE WANTED IT BACK DUCK WANTED TO KEEP IT AND A ROW BROKE OUT 
AND THEY TUGGED AT EITHER END UNTIL LILY SKIPPED IN FROM THE GARDEN 
DON'T BE SO MEAN HAROLD SHE SAID LET HIM HAVE IT 
THE SOCK BECAME THE POSSESSION OF THE DELIGHTED DUCK 
HAROLD WAS ORDERED OUT OF THE HOUSE BAD DOG SCOLDED LILY 
BAD BAD DOG 
HAROLD SAT ALONE ON THE HILL 
UNTIL THE MOON ROSE AS YELLOW AS BUTTERCUPS 
HE WAS HOPING THE CHILDREN WOULD COME TO CALL HIM BUT THEY HADN'T 
IT WAS APPROACHING SUPPERTIME AND HE FELT HUNGRY 
BUT MORE THAN THAT HE FELT UNWANTED AND SAD 
THE UNWANTEDNESS COLLECTED IN HIS TAIL WHICH HE COULDN'T LIFT 
HIS TAIL WAS AS HEAVY AS HIS HEART 
AT LAST HUNGER HAD THE BETTER OF HIM 
AND WITH LIFELESS EARS AND A LEADEN WAGGER HE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE 
THE DOOR WAS AJAR AND HE CREPT INTO THE KITCHEN BEHIND SO MANY BLINKS 
HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT 
THERE WAS A BOWL OF FRESH FOOD FRESH WATER AND NO DUCK 
A RAPID SNIFF ROUND CONFIRMED IT THE DUCK HAD GONE 
HAROLD LEAPT IN THE AIR AND CAME DOWN IN HIS BASKET 
OH JOY OH BLISS WHAT A PRESENT IS HOME 
THERE IN ALL ITS MAGNIFICENCE WAS A FULL MEAT SERVING 
HE TUCKED IN SAVOURING THE TEXTURE 
OF CRUNCHY BISCUITS AND RUBBERY MORSELS M. M. M. 
AS HE ATE HE BECAME AWARE OF LAUGHTER 
IT SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING FUNNY WAS HAPPENING UPSTAIRS 
ALTHOUGH HE WASN'T REALLY ALLOWED 
HE FELT HAPPY ENOUGH TO RISK A TELLING OFF 
AND QUIETLY HE CLIMBED TO THE LANDING 
THE FUN WAS COMING FROM THE BATHROOM 
SHRIEKS AND SPLASHES AND HAROLD WANTED IN ON IT 
ABANDONING ALL CAUTION HE BOUNDED THROUGH THE DOOR 
THE SIGHT THAT GREETED HIM WILTED HIS WAG 
THE CHILDREN WERE IN THE BATH WITH TOYS BETWEEN THEM 
WHICH INCLUDED THE DUCK 
HE WAS IN THE BATH SWIMMING IN THE BUBBLES HAVING A SHAMPOO 
YOU SHOULDN'T BE UPSTAIRS SAID LILY 
HAROLD KNEW WHERE HE SHOULDN'T BE WHERE HE NO LONGER WANTED TO BE 
AND THAT WAS IN THE DUCK'S HOUSE 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS HE SAW A GLINT OF EYES IN THE DARKNESS 
IT WAS PUD PUD WAITING FOR HIS SUPPER 
AREN'T YOU GOING TO CHASE ME SAID THE ASTONISHED PUD 
NO SAID HAROLD STEALING PAST AS THOUGH HE WASN'T THERE 
I'M LEAVING 
LEAVING SAID THE PUD BUT WHERE WILL YOU GO 
THAT'S NOT A QUESTION YOU CAN PUT TO A HOUND IN MY POSITION SAID HAROLD 
MY MOTHER CAME SECOND AT CRUFTS AND I WILL GO WHERE I AM WANTED 
DON'T GO HAROLD I SHALL MISS YOU 
MISS ME SAID HAROLD WITH GENUINE SURPRISE WHAT WOULD YOU MISS 
WELL THE HAROLDNESS OF YOU SAID THE PUD 
YOU'RE HAROLD AND THIS IS YOUR FARM IT WON'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU 
IT ISN'T THE SAME ANYWAY REPLIED THE DEJECTED DOG AND NEVER CAN BE 
PUD PUD WATCHED HIM DISAPPEAR THEN IT TURNED 
TO SEE THE FRESHLY LAUNDERED AND SELF SATISFIED DUCK 
WADDLE INTO THE KITCHEN 
PUD KNEW THERE WASN'T LONG BEFORE THE CHILDREN CAME DOWN IN THEIR PYJAMAS 
HE WENT IN AND MADE HIMSELF FRIENDLY WITH THE DUCK 
NICE AND WARM IN HERE ISN'T IT DUCK 
PAYING NO ATTENTION THE DUCK GOT INTO HAROLD'S BASKET 
I SHOULD THINK CONTINUED THE PUD 
IT'S ALL TO DO WITH THE COAL ON THE FIRE IN THAT VERY BIG OVEN 
QUACK AGREED THE DUCK HE LIKED THAT LOVELY WARM STOVE 
THAT'S MY AUNTIE HE SAID I WAS BORN IN THERE 
DID YOU KNOW THAT DUCKS WHO COME OUT OF AN OVEN OFTEN GO BACK INTO ONE 
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT SAID THE DUCK 
I'M TALKING ABOUT ONIONS CONFIDED THE PUD 
I'M TALKING ABOUT POTATOES AND ABOUT GRAVY 
PUD WAS NOW WHISPERING SO CLOSE TO THE DUCK'S TUFT 
AND HE COULD NO LONGER BE HEARD 
TO JUDGE FROM THE BIRD'S DARKENING EXPRESSION 
THE PUD WAS ITEMISING THE ELEMENTS OF A SUNDAY ROAST 
WHICH INCLUDED SAGE AND ONION STUFFING 
HOLY QUACK SAID THE DUCK LET ME OUT 
MEANWHILE ON THE LANE HAROLD TRUDGED IN THE MOONLIGHT 
IT WASN'T EASY LEAVING HOME HE WOULD MISS THE CHILDREN 
HE WOULD EVEN MISS THE PUD 
HE STOPPED TO TAKE A LAST LOOK BACK AT HIS BEAUTIFUL FARM 
HE SAW SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO THAT EXPECTED 
THERE WAS A SCREECHING AND OUT OF THE DARKNESS SPED THE TUFTED DUCK 
ITS BEAK WAS WIDE ITS FEET A BLUR 
IT WENT PAST LIKE THE FASTEST THING YOU CAN THINK OF 
A MOMENT LATER IT WAS GONE 
SQUAWKING INTO THE NIGHT AS QUICKLY AS IT HAD COME 
THERE WAS A VOICE AND HAROLD'S EARS INSTINCTIVELY LIFTED 
THE CHILDREN WERE CALLING FOR HIM FROM FAR ACROSS THE MEADOW 
WHAT SAW THE DUCK OFF AND MADE THEM WANT HIM BACK 
THE QUESTION WAS TOO COMPLICATED TO ANSWER AND HE DIDN'T TRY 
HE WAS RUNNING FOR HOME 
BEFORE HE KNEW IT HE WAS IN THE KITCHEN 
ROUND THE TABLE HE RAN TWO AND A HALF TIMES OR MORE 
WHERE WERE YOU SAID LILY WE WERE WORRIED 
SCOOPING HIM UP SHE SMOTHERED HIM IN CUDDLES AND KISSES 
HE RAN ROUND THE TABLE AGAIN WOOF 
HAROLD WAS HOME WITH EVERYTHING WHERE IT ALWAYS HAD BEEN 
HIS BOWL HIS BASKET HIS SOCK AND HIS CHILDREN 
IT WAS ALL NORMAL AND NOTHING TO SPOIL IT EXCEPT 
EXCEPT THERE'S THAT VEXED BAG OF A CAT 
HE HURTLED AFTER IT LIKE A TORPEDO 
THROUGH THE BROCCOLI INTO THE BARN 
AND UP THE STAIRS AND DOWN THE OTHER SIDE 
HE WAS BARKING AND HE WAS HAPPY AND PUD PUD WAS HAPPY TOO 
THE MOON SHONE BRIGHT THAT NIGHT AND EVERYTHING WAS AT PEACE 
WOOLLY MEATS SLEPT IN THE PASTURES AND THE WEATHER VANE STOOD STILL 
EVERYTHING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE AND ALL THINGS AS THEY ALWAYS WOULD BE 
ON HAROLD'S FARM SEE YOU SOON
