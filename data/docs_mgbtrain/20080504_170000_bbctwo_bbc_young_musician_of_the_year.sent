IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT A GROUP OF B. B. C. PRODUCERS CAME UP WITH AN IDEA 
FOR A NEW COMPETITION THAT WOULD CHANGE THE WAY CLASSICAL MUSIC WAS PRESENTED ON TELEVISION 
THE YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR INVENTED REALITY T. V. COMPETITIONS 
LONG BEFORE THEY BECAME THE POPULAR FORUM THEY ARE NOW 
IT INTRODUCED US TO AN ABUNDANCE OF PRECOCIOUS YOUNG TALENT 
WHO HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST INFLUENCE 
HARD TO SAY I THINK PROBABLY I HAVE 
AND QUICKLY BECAME PART OF THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE 
IT'S A BRITISH INSTITUTION I THINK IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS 
IT WAS GRIPPING VIEWING 
WITHOUT THIS PROGRAMME IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET A PICTURE 
OF THE RANGE OF CLASSICAL MUSIC TALENT THAT THERE IS IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY 
THIS IS THE STORY OF AN AMBITIOUS AND RADICAL COMPETITION 
AND HOW IT CAME TO DISCOVER SOME OF BRITAIN'S MOST SUCCESSFUL MUSICIANS 
ON ITS THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY WE LOOK BACK AT SOME OF 
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY MUSICAL PERFORMANCES EVER SEEN ON TELEVISION 
IT HAS ADDED TO THE EXPERIENCE OF MUSICAL LIFE IN THIS COUNTRY 
IT'S A COLD WINTER NIGHT IN CARDIFF 
BRITAIN'S MOST GIFTED YOUNG MUSICIANS ARE CONVERGING ON THE CITY 
FOR THE CLOSING ROUNDS OF THE NATION'S BIGGEST CLASSICAL MUSIC COMPETITION 
NERVOUS EXCITED AND DETERMINED TO GIVE THE BEST POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE 
FEW ARE AWARE THAT THE PROGRAMME WAS INSPIRED BY TWO CLASSICAL MUSIC ENTHUSIASTS 
DRIVEN BY A BIT OF OLD FASHIONED BRITISH PRIDE 
THE B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF FAILURE 
OF ANY BRITISH PIANIST TO GET INTO THE LEEDS PIANO COMPETITION FINAL 
IN THE YEAR NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE 
HUMPHREY BURTON AND WALTER TODDS WERE KEY FIGURES 
IN THE B. B. C.'S MUSIC DEPARTMENT FROM THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES 
MAKING A RANGE OF CLASSICAL MUSIC PROGRAMMES THAT INCLUDED INTERNATIONAL MUSIC COMPETITIONS 
DISAPPOINTED BY THE FAILURE OF ANY HOME GROWN TALENT TO MAKE THE LEEDS FINAL 
THEY DECIDED TO TAKE POSITIVE ACTION AND GIVE BRITISH AUDIENCES 
SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE 
I WAS SAYING TO MY COLLEAGUES AFTER THE EVENT WE REALLY NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO REFLECT 
THE QUALITY OF BRITISH MUSICIANS 
WE SAID LET'S MAKE OUR OWN COMPETITION RESTRICT IT TO BRITISH YOUNG MUSICIANS 
THAT WAY WE'RE SURE TO HAVE A FINAL WITH PLENTY OF BRITS IN IT 
WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO DO 
WHICH IS MAKE A POSITIVE STATEMENT ABOUT THE MUSICAL YOUTH OF THIS COUNTRY THEY ARE UP TO SCRATCH 
THE SKYE BOAT SONG 
DURING THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES BRITISH SCHOOLS WERE LEADING A MUSICAL REVOLUTION 
AT HOYLAND EVERY CHILD IN THE JUNIOR SCHOOL IS TAUGHT TO READ AND PLAY MUSIC 
BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING 
MUSIC HAD BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 
IT WAS A VERY LUCKY TIME TO BE IN SCHOOL 
BECAUSE IT WAS GOVERNMENT POLICY 
TO ALLOW CHILDREN TO START AN INSTRUMENT FREE OF CHARGE 
IN A GROUP AND THEY COULD SEE IF THEY LIKED IT 
I REMEMBER IT WAS SO EXCITING 
TO BE OFFERED THE CHOICE OF CLARINET TRUMPET OR VIOLIN 
I REMEMBER RUSHING HOME AND SAYING WE CAN LEARN AN INSTRUMENT AT SCHOOL 
THE FOUNDERS OF YOUNG MUSICIAN RECOGNISED THE POTENTIAL OF ALL THIS TALENT AS A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY 
TO SHOW BRITISH YOUTH AT ITS BEST 
I PUT THIS IDEA OF A COMPETITION TO THE THEN CONTROLLER 
IT TOOK A LONG TIME TWO YEARS IN THE PLANNING 
THE FIRST COMPETITION WENT ON THE SCREENS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT 
GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO THE FINAL OF THE B. B. C. COMPETITION IN SEARCH OF THE YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
A FRIENDLY BUT VERY TOUGH COMPETITION WITH LOTS OF SURPRISES 
HAS PRODUCED FOUR FINALISTS WHO WILL EACH PLAY A CONCERTO WITH THE B. B. C. NORTHERN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
UNDER THE CONDUCTOR BRYDEN THOMSON 
THE FIRST YEAR OF THE YOUNG MUSICIAN WAS REALLY ONE OF THE HIGH POINTS OF MY WHOLE LIFE 
IT WAS SO MARVELLOUS TO SEE THIS THING COMING TO FRUITION 
THE FIRST PROGRAMME WENT OUT ON THE SEVENTH OF FEBRUARY NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT 
OVER THE NEXT TEN WEEKS MILLIONS OF VIEWERS WOULD TUNE IN TO WATCH SIX HUNDRED MUSICIANS 
COMPETE FOR JUST FOUR PLACES IN THE GRAND FINAL 
A COMPETITION OF THIS SCALE HAS NEVER BEFORE BEEN TACKLED IN THIS COUNTRY 
AS FAR AS WE CAN DISCOVER AND CERTAINLY NOT ON TELEVISION 
I THINK YOU'LL BE STARTLED BY THE QUALITY OF THE MUSICAL TALENT THAT'S REVEALED 
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ANTICIPATED HOW SUCCESSFUL IT WAS GOING TO BE 
I REMEMBER WATCHING IT THE FIRST TIME I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT 
I WAS AT A SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOL AT THE PURCELL SCHOOL 
WE JUST WERE I REMEMBER THINKING I'VE GOT TO DO THAT 
I WANT TO BE IN THERE DOING THAT THAT LOOKS FUN 
WHAT ABOUT THIS COMPETITION YOU'RE GOING IN FOR NOW 
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE I'LL REACH THE FINAL IF I PLAY AS WELL AS I CAN 
YOU CAN'T PREDICT ANYTHING 
IF YOU WANT TO BE A MUSICIAN THEN INEVITABLY 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO AT SOME POINT UNDERGO 
THE GRIM REALITY OF A COMPETITION 
THE B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR IS KIND OF 
AT THE PINNACLE OF COMPETITIONS I SUPPOSE 
IT'S MARVELLOUS TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO PLAY IN PUBLIC AT A YOUNGER AGE 
IT GIVES ME THE INCENTIVE TO WORK HARDER 
THIS WAS A PERFECTLY LOGICAL PROGRAMME AT THE TIME 
BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNEW THAT WE HAD THIS TREMENDOUS TALENT 
IN BRITAIN IT NEEDED SOME KIND OF COMPETITION 
I THINK A COMPETITION LIKE THIS IS USEFUL 
BECAUSE IT GIVES AN IDEA OF THE STANDARD OF PLAYING IN THE COUNTRY 
IT WORKED IT WORKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING 
WE SET THE TARGET QUITE HIGH 
EVERYBODY HAD TO HAVE VERY GOOD GRADE EIGHT IN THE FAMOUS ASSOCIATED BOARD EXAMS 
ALSO WE SAID THEY MUSTN'T BE NINETEEN THEY HAD TO BE UNDER NINETEEN ON THE DAY OF THE CONCERTO FINAL 
WE GOT I THINK IT WAS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX HUNDRED APPLICANTS THAT FIRST YEAR 
IT'S BEEN THAT WAY EVER SINCE 
A SUBURBAN HOUSE IN EDGWARE IS PERHAPS NOT THE PLACE YOU WOULD EXPECT 
TO FIND ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING MUSICAL TALENTS IN BRITAIN 
IT SEEMED NO SUBURBAN INTERIOR WAS COMPLETE WITHOUT A MUSICAL PRODIGY 
COMPETING WITH THE G. PLAN FOR ATTENTION 
GIVE US AN EXAMPLE I'LL JUST PLAY SOME OF THE CHOPIN STUDY 
THIRTY YEARS LATER TROMBONIST MIKE HEXT PLAYS IN THE ORCHESTRA AT THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HE WAS SEVENTEEN AND AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF HIS LIFE AS A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN 
MY FATHER WAS A BRASS TEACHER 
HE GAVE ME SOME LEAFLETS ONE DAY 
AND SAID HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THIS 
FIVE FOUR 
THE THIRD COMPETITOR IS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD TROMBONIST MICHAEL HEXT FROM BEDFORD 
HE'S PLAYING THE CONCERTO BY THE DANISH COMPOSER GRONDAHL WRITTEN IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR 
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS WORTH ME ACTUALLY GOING IN FOR IT I DIDN'T THINK I'D GET VERY FAR 
THE COMPETITION WAS COMPOSED OF REGIONAL HEATS 
FOLLOWED BY SEMI FINALS AND THEN THE CLASS FINALS 
MIKE BEAT OVER ONE HUNDRED BRASS PLAYERS TO MAKE IT TO THE GRAND FINAL 
WHERE SEVEN MILLION WOULD TUNE IN TO SEE HIM PLAY 
AGAINST STRINGS KEYBOARD AND WOODWIND 
COMPETING FOR THE FIRST EVER TITLE OF YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
HERE COMES MICHAEL HEXT 
HE'S SEVENTEEN AND A PUPIL AT BEDFORD COLLEGE OF HIGHER EDUCATION HE STARTED PLAYING THE TROMBONE 
AT THE AGE OF EIGHT WHICH ISN'T ALTOGETHER SURPRISING 
HIS FATHER IS A TROMBONE TEACHER 
CONCERTO FOR TROMBONE AND ORCHESTRA BY GORDON JACOB MICHAEL HEXT 
I TEND TO THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF THE GAMUT OF EMOTIONS 
THAT I FELT THAT DAY 
NOT LEAST OF ALL SURPRISE 
I REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT TO WIN IT 
THE DECISION OF THE JURY IS 
THAT THE TROPHY B. B. C. TELEVISION'S YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THIS YEAR NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT 
SHOULD GO TO MR. MICHAEL HEXT 
THE PORTRAIT OF A HAPPY YOUNG TROMBONIST 
ABSOLUTELY FLABBERGASTED 
I WAS PLEASED THAT I'D WON THE BRASS CLASS 
TO HAVE WON THE WHOLE THING WAS A REAL SHOCK A REAL SHOCK 
MIKE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS SHOCKED 
THE STRINGS AND KEYBOARDS WERE THE FAVOURITES TO WIN 
IT WAS REGARDED AS HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL TO AWARD THE PRIZE TO SUCH AN UNUSUAL INSTRUMENT 
EVERYBODY WAS KNOCKED FOR SIX I WAS TERRIBLY PLEASED 
THAT IT WAS THE TROMBONE BECAUSE THAT MEANT THAT AN UNFASHIONABLE INSTRUMENT 
FOR WHICH VERY FEW TROMBONE CONCERTOS EXIST 
AND YET THIS YOUNG PLAYER HAD SUCH POISE AND SUCH STYLE AND MADE SUCH A LOVELY SOUND WITH HIS INSTRUMENT 
THESE INSTRUMENTS THEY CALL THEM ENDANGERED SPECIES AND WE NEED PEOPLE TO PLAY THEM 
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE COMES AND PLAYS THE PIANO 
DOESN'T MEAN THEY SHOULD WIN THE COMPETITION 
IT MUST BE DONE ON THE LEVEL OF THE PERFORMANCE 
MAYBE THERE WAS PART OF ME THAT DIDN'T THINK THE TROMBONE 
COULD WIN A COMPETITION LIKE THAT 
I SAW IT AS A SORT OF AN ENSEMBLE INSTRUMENT THAT OCCASIONALLY STANDS UP AND PLAYS SOLOS 
MICHAEL HEXT ON THE NIGHT PULLED IT OFF 
IT WAS AMAZING YOUNG MUSICIAN HAS SEEN NEARLY TEN THOUSAND MUSICIANS THROUGH ITS DOORS 
IN ITS THIRTY YEAR HISTORY 
MANY OF THEM HAVE GONE ON TO BECOME SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN CLASSICAL MUSIC 
EMMA JOHNSON THE WORLD RENOWNED CLARINETTIST ENTERED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR 
I WENT INTO YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR BECAUSE I WAS ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE 
TO BE A MUSICIAN 
EMMA JOHNSON'S ONE OF THOSE PLAYERS THAT HAS THAT SORT OF INFECTIOUS TALENT 
THERE'S THIS TINY LITTLE GIRL 
THAT MAKES THIS HUGE SOUND ON THE CLARINET 
EMMA JOHNSON AGED SEVENTEEN IN THE SIXTH FORM AT SEVENOAKS SCHOOL IN KENT 
WHEN I DID IT MOST OF US HAD HARDLY EVER PERFORMED IN PUBLIC BEFORE 
IT WAS EXCITING BUT IT WAS ALSO QUITE AN ORDEAL 
THAT CHALLENGE OF THAT PERFORMANCE IN YOUR DIARY 
IT'S THERE IT WON'T GO AWAY 
IT ALSO GETS YOU TO THINK ABOUT PROGRAMMING AND HOW TO SLOT PIECES TOGETHER 
THAT WILL WORK AS A PACKAGE 
AND HOW TO PACE YOURSELF SO YOU CAN GET THROUGH A WHOLE RECITAL PROGRAMME 
WE USED BACKSTAGE TO HAVE BETS ON WHO WAS GOING TO WIN 
WE DIDN'T TRY TO INFLUENCE IT IN ANY WAY 
WE USED TO SIT THERE RUNNING A SWEEPSTAKE AS IT WERE OF 
WHO WAS LIKELY TO BE THE ONE TO GO THROUGH 
I REMEMBER THAT WHEN I SAW EMMA JOHNSON 
THERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO BEAT 
WE HAVE DECIDED TO AWARD THE FIRST PRIZE 
TO EMMA JOHNSON 
EMMA JOHNSON SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD FROM ORPINGTON IN KENT 
IT WAS JUST THE GREATEST THRILL TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THE CLARINET 
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE WHICH I'D NOT DONE VERY MUCH 
TO HAVE AN AUDIENCE TO BE A PART OF WHAT YOU WERE DOING 
IT'S NOT JUST THE WINNERS WHO ARE PROPELLED INTO THE LIMELIGHT 
THE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE GENERAL HIGH QUALITY 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THE WINNER TO DO VERY WELL 
IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE'VE DISCOVERED PAUL COKER 
STEVEN HUFF BARRY DOUGLAS DAVID HORNE 
HUGELY SUCCESSFUL CELLIST AND CONDUCTOR PAUL WATKINS 
SECURED A PLACE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FINAL 
PAUL WATKINS JUST GOD 
WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW DISGUSTINGLY TALENTED HE IS AS A CELLIST 
AND NOW AS A CONDUCTOR 
OF COURSE I SHOULD HAVE WON I WAS BY FAR THE BEST 
ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T WIN THE YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
I GOT TO THE CONCERTO FINAL AND SUDDENLY FOUND MYSELF UP IN MANCHESTER 
WITH ALL THESE RATHER INTIMIDATING STUDIO CAMERAS CIRCLING AROUND ME 
LIKE DALEKS ACTUALLY 
IT WAS THAT KIND OF FEELING 
OF BEING SCRUTINISED JUST BEFORE HIS FINAL PERFORMANCE 
PAUL MADE WHAT WAS TO BE A FATEFUL DECISION 
HE'S DECIDED AT THE LAST MOMENT TO PLAY TONIGHT ON HIS TEACHER'S CELLO 
AT THAT TIME I WAS PLAYING ON A CELLO THAT MY FATHER MADE 
WHICH I STILL USE OCCASIONALLY 
FOR THE FINAL IT WAS DECIDED AMONGST VARIOUS TEACHERS AND ADVISERS 
THAT IT MIGHT BE AN IDEA TO PLAY A MAGNIFICENT OLD ITALIAN INSTRUMENT BY GOFRILLER 
IT'S DEBATABLE WHETHER I HAD ENOUGH TIME TO GET USED TO IT 
BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D PLAYED IN PUBLIC ON AN OLD ITALIAN INSTRUMENT 
AND AS ALL STRING PLAYERS KNOW THAT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE 
FROM A MODERN INSTRUMENT NO MATTER HOW GOOD THE MODERN INSTRUMENT IS 
SWAPPING HIS DAD'S HOME MADE CELLO FOR AN ITALIAN MASTER 
JUST WASN'T ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUL THE EDGE HE NEEDED 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HAPPENED 
I HOPE MY DAD'S NOT TOO OFFENDED THAT 
HE'S A GREAT ADMIRER OF ALL THOSE OLD INSTRUMENTS 
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLE BE JEALOUS OF A LONG DEAD ITALIAN 
I DON'T KNOW I HOPE IT'S O. K. DAD 
I REALLY DO 
APPEARING ON YOUNG MUSICIAN MEANT THAT EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR PERFORMANCE 
WAS UNDER SCRUTINY BY MILLIONS OF VIEWERS 
I THINK WE ALL NOTICED 
THAT HE WAS HAVING A BIT OF TROUBLE WITH THE HEAT 
THAT WONDERFUL INCIDENT WITH THE DUSTER BETWEEN MOVEMENTS TWO 
IT ALSO MEANT A BACKSTAGE GRILLING FROM HUMPHREY 
IT WAS DO YOUR PIECE AND THEN SIT IN THE STUDIO WITH HUMPHREY AFTERWARDS 
AND TALK FOR A FEW MINUTES ON HOW IT HAD GONE LIKE SPORTS PROGRAMMES NOW 
THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO WASH AND BRUSH UP I GATHER YOU HAD TROUBLE WITH THE HEAT AT ONE POINT 
YES IT WAS TERRIBLY HOT IN THERE 
I AM TOLD THEY HAD TO REHEARSE THEIR INTERVIEW WITH HUMPHREY 
AS WELL AS THEIR PERFORMANCE WITH A SCHOOLTEACHER AT HOME 
TO GET THE HANG OF THIS TRIAL OF HUMPHREY ASKING SILLY QUESTIONS 
HE COULD SOMETIMES ASK SLIGHTLY STRANGE QUESTIONS WHICH WOULD WRONG FOOT YOU AS A TEENAGER 
YOU'RE SITTING NURSING THIS ENORMOUS INSTRUMENT BETWEEN YOUR LEGS 
AND A LOT OF US HAVE BEEN ADMIRING IT ON THE T. V. CAMERAS THIS AFTERNOON 
AND IT HAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL TEXTURE 
IS IT AN ENGLISH INSTRUMENT YES 
HE ONCE ASKED ME WHO MY MAIN INSPIRATION WAS AND I THINK 
RATHER HORRIBLY I SAID ME 
AND WHO HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST INFLUENCE IN YOUR LIFE UM 
IT'S HARD TO SAY I THINK I HAVE 
HUMPHREY PUT UP WITH HUNDREDS OF COCKY MUSICIANS PRESENTING THE PROGRAMME FOR FOURTEEN YEARS 
HE HAD A VAST AMOUNT OF MUSICAL KNOWLEDGE AND WAS ONE OF THE DRIVING FORCES BEHIND THE SHOW 
HUMPHREY BURTON IS FANTASTIC WHEN YOU'VE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HIM 
YOU FEEL A BIT LIKE SOMEONE SUCKED YOUR BRAIN OUT THROUGH YOUR NOSE 
AND I MEAN THAT IN A GOOD WAY 
WAS IT RISKY PLAYING A PIECE BY RAMEAU WHICH WASN'T FOR CLARINET DESPITE HIS HUGE KNOWLEDGE 
HUMPHREY TOOK GREAT PAINS TO PUT NERVOUS TEENAGERS AT EASE 
HUMPHREY WAS GREAT HE WAS SO ENCOURAGING TO EVERYBODY 
DO YOU STILL GET JOKES ABOUT A NICE GIRL LIKE YOU PLAYING THE TROMBONE 
IT WAS FASCINATING TO MEET THEM I LOVED TALKING TO THEM 
HE WAS ALWAYS SURE TO ASK HOW THEY FELT ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE 
IS THAT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE EVER PLAYED IN AN ORCHESTRA APART FROM REHEARSALS IT WAS REALLY BRILLIANT 
YOU'RE SEEING THESE YOUNG MUSICIANS HAVING ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCES THEY'LL EVER HAVE 
WHICH IS PLAYING WITH A SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA ONE HUNDRED PLAYERS 
BACKING THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME 
OH I DID ENJOY THAT 
FOR MANY FINALISTS THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS THE MOST THRILLING PART OF THE COMPETITION 
YES THAT WAS THE PRIZE FOR ME TO GET TO PLAY WITH AN ORCHESTRA IN THE FINAL 
JUST THAT FANTASTIC SOUND AN ORCHESTRA MAKES WHEN YOU'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF IT 
WHEN I CAME OFF AFTER THE PERFORMANCE IN THE FINAL 
I JUST THOUGHT WOW I WISH I COULD DO THAT AGAIN 
IN NINETEEN NINETY FIFTEEN YEAR OLD VIOLINIST NICOLA LOUD GOT HER CHANCE 
IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF DOING A CONCERTO WITH A FULL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA SO IT WAS VERY EXCITING 
IT'S JUST THIS MASSIVE SOUND AND THERE'S THIS MASSIVE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE 
ON THE STAGE YOU KNOW 
THEY SEEM MUCH LOUDER THAN YOU EVER THOUGHT THEY WOULD 
YOU HAVE MAYBE ONE HUNDRED PLAYERS BACKING YOU AND YOU NEVER REALISE JUST HOW MUCH NOISE 
AS A SOLOIST HOW MUCH SOUND YOU HAVE TO PRODUCE 
THEN YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE THE ORCHESTRA MOVE WITH YOU 
IF YOU WANT TO GO FASTER HOW YOU MAKE THEM DO THAT 
IF YOU WANNA GO SLOWER HOW YOU PULL THEM BACK IT'S SOMETHING 
VERY DIFFICULT TO DO AND OFTEN TAKES PEOPLE YEARS TO LEARN 
MORE IN THAT THE FIRST TIME A YOUNG MUSICIAN HAS DONE THIS 
THE T. V. VIEWER IS SEEING SOMETHING SPECIAL THAT THAT PLAYER WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER 
YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR NINETEEN NINETY IS NICOLA LOUD 
NICOLA LOUD WHO IS FIFTEEN FROM HORNSEY IN NORTH LONDON 
IT ENABLES YOU TO TAKE THAT PLATFORM 
AND DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH IT AND I WAS ABLE TO GO OFF 
AND START DOING THE BIGGER PIECES 
AT A YOUNGER AGE SO IT DOES GIVE YOU A GREAT OPPORTUNITY 
NOT ONLY WERE THE FINALISTS PLAYING WITH A FULL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
THEY WERE PLAYING TO SOME OF THE GREATEST NAMES IN CLASSICAL MUSIC 
WHO MADE UP THE FORMIDABLE PANEL 
WE HAD YEHUDI MENUHIN HARRY MORTIMER THE GREAT TRUMPETER 
WE HAD LEON GOOSSENS THE FINEST OBOIST OF HIS DAY 
WE HAD THE VERY TOP PEOPLE 
AND FINALLY THAT FINE YOUNG CELLIST JULIAN LLOYD WEBBER 
WORLD CLASS CELLIST JULIAN LLOYD WEBBER WAS A JUDGE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY 
IN A WAY IT'S SCARY BEING A JUDGE PARTICULARLY ON THE FINAL 
BECAUSE IT IS YOU'RE IN AN IMPORTANT POSITION AT THAT POINT 
BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY YOUNG PLAYERS THEY'RE VERY BRILLIANT PLAYERS 
YOU DON'T WANT TO IN ANY WAY DISCOURAGE ANYONE 
EVERY YEAR THE JURY HAS TO WRESTLE WITH SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOUNG MUSICIAN UNIQUE 
ONE OF THE CRITICISMS I'VE HEARD FROM THIS COMPETITION FROM THE VERY BEGINNING 
WAS HOW CAN YOU COMPARE ONE INSTRUMENT AGAINST ANOTHER 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO COMPARE STRING WITH WIND 
WITH PIANO WITH BRASS 
THE DAILY MAIL YESTERDAY COMMENTED THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CHOOSE 
BETWEEN SUCH VERY DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS BUT I ASSURE YOU THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF FACTORS 
THAT HELP A JURY TO SORT OUT AN ORDER OF PRECEDENCE IT'S INCREDIBLY SIMPLE THERE WILL USUALLY BE 
NOT ALWAYS BUT THERE IS SOMEONE WHO HAS MASTERED THEIR INSTRUMENT 
TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT YOU ARE JUST AWARE OF THE MUSIC 
SO IT'S AS THOUGH THERE'S NOTHING IMPEDING THE FLOW OF THE MUSIC 
THROUGH THEM TO THE AUDIENCE WHEN YOU HEAR SAY TEN PIANISTS 
OR SIX CELLISTS PLAYING THE SAME PIECE OF MUSIC IT BECOMES REALLY DIFFICULT 
I'VE FOUND IT AN EASIER SITUATION TO JUDGE 
BECAUSE YOU JUST ARE LISTENING FOR THE BEST FINISHED PERFORMANCE 
I CAN'T SEE ANY OTHER CRITERIA 
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD OBOIST NICHOLAS DANIEL MADE THE FINAL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY 
WHEN JULIAN WAS ON THE PANEL I REMEMBER HE PLAYED VAUGHAN WILLIAMS THE OBOE CONCERTO FIRST MOVEMENT 
AND IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND FLAWLESS PLAYING 
ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS AND HE WAS A CLEAR WINNER 
IT'S REALLY FUN SOME PEOPLE WERE VERY VERY SERIOUS 
TOOK THE IDEA OF BEING IN A COMPETITION VERY SERIOUSLY 
AND THAT'S JUST NOT MY WAY I WAS TO GIVE A CONCERT AND MY BEST 
I WANTED FIRST AND FOREMOST TO COMMUNICATE SO THAT'S WHAT I TRIED TO DO 
THE COMPETITION WAS ALMOST LIKE A DREAM TIME 
FOR ME REALLY I HAD THE STRONGEST INSTINCT THAT IT WAS TO BE FOR ME 
I HAD A VERY PSYCHIC GREAT AUNT WHO TOLD ME I WAS GOING TO WIN IT 
MR. NICHOLAS DANIEL 
HE JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
THAT IS A GREAT MOMENT IN ANYBODY'S LIFE 
THE OBOE ISN'T EVERYBODY'S CUP OF TEA AS A SOLO INSTRUMENT 
AND HE SHOWED HOW IT COULD BE AND CAME THROUGH WITH SHINING COLOURS 
BEST MUSICAL PERFORMER MOST MATURE CHOSE SUCH A CLEVER PROGRAMME AND NOW HE'S COMING 
TO SALUTE THIS BIG AUDIENCE 
AS YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR NINETEEN EIGHTY 
I SHOWED A TAPE OF ME WINNING THE COMPETITION TO MY CHILDREN RECENTLY 
AND THEY SAID OH DAD THAT HAIRCUT 
WHAT WERE THEY WEARING WHAT WAS THAT HAIRCUT FROM HELL 
APART FROM NINETEEN EIGHTIES HAIR WHAT DOES DEFINE THE PERFECT PERFORMANCE 
BASICALLY THE JURY WILL BE CONSIDERING TWO THINGS 
TECHNIQUE OF THE PERFORMERS AND MUSICIANSHIP AND HOW IT'S MANIFESTED IN THE CONCERTOS THEY PLAY 
SO OFTEN PEOPLE CAN COME ONTO A STAGE AND PERFORM SOMETHING THAT'S CORRECT AND THE NOTES ARE THERE 
AND THE RHYTHM IS THERE 
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT MUSIC IS ABOUT 
AT ALL I THINK IT'S ABOUT CREATING A MOMENT IN TIME 
WITH YOURSELF AND AN AUDIENCE IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
FOURTEEN YEARS AFTER CLAIMING THE TITLE 
NICK LIKE MANY EX WINNERS FOUND HIMSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JUDGES' TABLE 
I WAS A JUDGE IN THE FINAL WHEN NATALIE CLEIN WON IT 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD NATALIE CLEIN FROM POOLE WILL PLAY ELGAR'S CELLO CONCERTO 
SO MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HEARD ME PLAY THAT FROM ONE PERFORMANCE 
THEY REACTED INCREDIBLY STRONGLY TO MY INTERPRETATION OF IT 
THERE WERE MOMENTS DURING MY PLAYING WHEN I REALLY FORGOT EVERYTHING 
I FORGOT THE CAMERAS ALL OF THE TIME AND I FORGOT THE COMPETITION 
BUT I STILL FELT NERVOUS TO BE PLAYING IN THIS BIG BIG HALL WITH THESE PEOPLE 
NATALIE HAS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO MOVE 
THE MUSIC SEEMS TO COME STRAIGHT THROUGH HER 
I REMEMBER IN THE BARBICAN CENTRE THE CAMERAS CAME TO ME FOR A COMMENT 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER SHE'D PLAYED AND I WAS WIPING TEARS OFF MY FACE 
IT WAS SO SAD AND UM 
IT WAS REALLY SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL 
INCANDESCENT THANK YOU 
TRYING TO GET A GRIP ON IT THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
IS NATALIE CLEIN 
SO NATALIE CLEIN IS THE WINNER 
SHE RECEIVES THE YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TROPHY AND BURSARY 
TO GET THE WHOLE PACKAGE IN YOUNG MUSICIAN IS VERY RARE 
AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T COME ONCE IN A DECADE 
WHERE THERE IS AUTHORITY AND CONTROL 
COMBINED WITH YOU KNOW AN INCREDIBLY MATURE RANGE OF EMOTION 
IT IS ONE OF LIFE'S MYSTERIES REALLY WHAT MAKES A MUSICIAN 
BETTER THAN ANY OTHER OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN HAVE A PLAYER WHO IS EXCELLENT TECHNICALLY 
BUT SOMEHOW DOESN'T COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC 
AND I THINK THE ONES WITH THAT LITTLE BIT EXTRA 
THEY HAVE THIS GIFT OF COMMUNICATION 
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT SHOWING OFF ON THE PLATFORM 
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY BRINGING THAT MUSIC TOUCHING PEOPLE'S HEARTS 
THE JUDGES ALWAYS LOOK FOR SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY ON THE STAGE 
AND IN TWO THOUSAND CELLIST GUY JOHNSTON WAS DETERMINED TO GIVE THEM JUST THAT 
I REMEMBER WHEN I GOT THE STRING FINAL 
WHAT CONCERTO COULD ONE PLAY IN TWENTY FIVE MINUTES IN THE FINAL 
AND SHOSTAKOVICH CAME INTO THAT TIME FRAME 
AND I REMEMBER IT WAS A PIECE I REALLY LOVED 
AND HERE COMES GUY JOHNSTON EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD FROM HARPENDEN 
TO PERFORM THE CELLO CONCERTO NO ONE BY SHOSTAKOVICH 
I REMEMBERED SO MUCH ADRENALINE I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH AN ATMOSPHERE 
IN A PERFORMANCE UNTIL THAT STAGE 
THERE WAS MORE OF A CHALLENGE OF PLAYING IN THE SITUATION THAN THE WINNING PART OF IT 
IT WAS SORT OF A. IT WAS SUCH A BUZZ 
AND A THRILL TO PLAY WITH ORCHESTRA 
AND TO PLAY A WORK LIKE THAT 
I HAD A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO MY INSTRUMENT A NEW BRIDGE PUT ON 
KNOWING THAT I WAS GOING TO BE PLAYING WITH ORCHESTRA 
THESE CHANGES WERE TO HAVE A BIGGER EFFECT THAN GUY EXPECTED 
THE STRING BROKE EARLY ON IN THE FIRST MOVEMENT 
IT HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE 
SO I WAS VERY MUCH LEARNING 
AS I WENT ALONG 
AND IN SOME RESPECTS IT WAS A GOOD THING I HAD TO COPE WITH IT AT THE TIME I REMEMBER BEING SO FOCUSED 
THAT IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A DREAM 
WELL GUY JOHNSTON HAS BROKEN A STRING ON THE CELLO 
RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERFORMANCE 
SO HE WILL TAKE A FEW MINUTES NOW TO GO BACKSTAGE 
AND GET A NEW STRING I REMEMBER BEING BACKSTAGE AND THERE WAS A CAMERA UP MY NOSE 
AND EVERYONE WAS SAYING EVERYTHING O. K. ALL I CARED ABOUT WAS PUTTING THE STRING ON AND ADJUSTING IT 
WHEN YOU PLAY AND PEOPLE SAID YOU NEED TO GO BACK ON 
A HEART STOPPING MOMENT BUT WHAT A CHEER TO GREET GUY JOHNSTON 
BACK ONSTAGE ONCE AGAIN WHEN PEOPLE ASK HOW DID YOU COPE 
I DON'T KNOW I DID MANAGE TO COPE 
I REMEMBER COMING BACK ON HAVING TO COMPLETELY REFOCUS AND CHANNEL EVERYTHING AGAIN 
MAYBE THE A STRING GAVE UP ON ME OR MAYBE IT WAS SHOSTAKOVICH 
DESPITE THE INCIDENT GUY WENT ON TO TAKE THE TITLE 
AND THE WINNER IS 
GUY JOHNSTON 
I'LL BE REMEMBERED FOR A BROKEN STRING AND MAYBE NOT THE PERFORMANCE 
GUY WASN'T THE ONLY MUSICIAN WHO HAD TO COPE WITH THE UNEXPECTED 
THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR STRING FINAL 
SAW NICOLA BENEDETTI STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ODDS WITH HER VIOLIN 
THE CHIN REST OF NICOLA'S VIOLIN HAS FALLEN OFF 
AND THIS IS A PROBLEM 
THAT IS SET TO DISRUPT THE REST OF HER PERFORMANCE HERE TONIGHT 
THE CHIN REST INCIDENT WAS I THINK ONE OF THOSE THINGS 
WHILST IT'S HAPPENING YOU DO ONE OF TWO THINGS 
YOU PANIC OR JUST ADMIT TO YOURSELF 
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT NOW 
AND YOU JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT 
NICOLA HAD TO HURRY BACKSTAGE TO RE ATTACH THE CHIN REST 
THE CHIN REST HAS A SORT OF METAL CLAMP 
ATTACHED TO THE CLAMP IS A PIECE OF CORK 
WHICH OBVIOUSLY STOPS THE METAL FROM SLIPPING 
NICOLA AND HER TEACHER THOUGHT THEY'D SOLVED THE PROBLEM 
AND THEN AFTER THE FIRST TIME WE TIGHTENED IT UP 
THE CORK HAD COMPLETELY COME OFF 
SO NO MATTER HOW SECURE WE THOUGHT IT WAS 
THE CHIN REST WOULD JUST SLIP 
SNAP OF METAL 
SORRY I'M REALLY SORRY 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO IS IT FIXABLE I'D LIKE TO FINISH 
YOU WANT TO FINISH ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM 
I THINK THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED WAS O. K. THAT'S FINE 
BUT IT HAPPENED TWO OR THREE TIMES 
STAY 
SNAP OF METAL 
BUT ALL WAS NOT LOST 
LUCKILY THERE WAS SOMEBODY IN THE AUDIENCE WITH A VIOLIN 
SO I USED HER CHIN REST INSTEAD 
IT WAS NERVE WRACKING 
BUT I THINK WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH MY MIND ALL THE TIME 
WAS THAT I WAS DESPERATE TO FINISH 
UM THERE WAS PART OF THE PIECE THAT I HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO PLAY YET 
AND I'D PREPARED SO HARD 
AND WORKED SO HARD FOR THE SEMI FINALS 
THAT I WAS JUST DETERMINED NO MATTER WHAT TO GET TO THE END 
DESPITE THE DRAMA NICOLA'S PERFORMANCE 
IMPRESSED THE JUDGES ENOUGH FOR HER TO WIN A PLACE IN THE GRAND FINAL 
FOR ME ACTUALLY THE EXCITEMENT OF GETTING TO THE FINAL 
STOPPED TO BE ABOUT WHETHER I WOULD WIN OR NOT 
IT WAS HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITH A TOP CLASS 
ORCHESTRA AND CONDUCTOR AND MY CHOICE OF REPERTOIRE 
AND HERE COMES NICOLA BENEDETTI FOLLOWED BY ILAN VOLKOV 
NICOLA HAS CHOSEN TO PLAY THE FIRST VIOLIN CONCERTO BY THE TWENTIETH CENTURY POLISH COMPOSER KAROL SZYMANOWSKY 
I THOUGHT SHE WAS VERY BRAVE IN THE FINAL 
TO CHOOSE A SZYMANOWSKY VIOLIN CONCERTO 
THAT WAS NICOLA'S FIRST TIME PLAYING THAT CONCERTO 
BUT IT WAS A PIECE SHE LOVED AND OF COURSE 
THAT COMES ACROSS IN THE PERFORMANCE 
AND PROBABLY IS WHAT CLINCHES THE PRIZE 
WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON WAS MAKING SURE 
I WAS GIVING THE BEST PERFORMANCE I COULD THAT EVENING 
AND ACTUALLY AFTER THE PERFORMANCE I WAS HAPPY WITH WHAT I'D DONE 
WHICH IS VERY RARE 
SO THE WINNER OF THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR IS NICOLA BENEDETTI 
WELL SIXTEEN YEAR OLD NICOLA BENEDETTI FROM SCOTLAND HAS TAKEN THE TOP PRIZE 
I DIDN'T THINK I HAD REALLY GIVEN WINNING MUCH OF A THOUGHT AT ALL 
JUST COMPLETE SHOCK WHEN MY NAME WAS ANNOUNCED 
THE TRUE SATISFACTION FOR ME WAS MOST DEFINITELY 
HOW I FELT THINGS HAD GONE MUSICALLY THAT DAY 
IT WASN'T JUST NICOLA'S PLAYING THAT CAUGHT THE WORLD'S ATTENTION 
IT ALSO DOESN'T HURT THAT SHE LOOKS AS GORGEOUS AS SHE DOES 
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL TO WATCH SHE LOOKS LOVELY PLAYING 
AND SHE'S PLAYING A FANTASTIC CLASSIC OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE 
CONGRATULATIONS AND A BEAUTIFUL FROCK BY THE WAY THANK YOU 
AND NICOLA WASN'T THE ONLY COMPETITOR TO WEAR A POSH FROCK 
WHAT TO WEAR IS HUGELY IMPORTANT YEAH 
I REMEMBER THINKING GOODNESS ME WHAT A FANTASTIC THING 
BUT OH MY GOD WHAT DO I WEAR 
I HAD TO SPEND AGES THINKING ABOUT WHAT I WEAR 
BUT IT REALLY DOES INTEREST PEOPLE 
YOU'LL ALREADY KNOW OUR FOUR CONCERTO FINALISTS 
WELL THEY'RE IN THE GREEN ROOM NOW 
I REMEMBER THINKING I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO FRILLY 
SO I HAD THIS VERY STRAIGHT LONG BLUE DRESS 
AND I STILL HAVE IT YES IT'S A BIT LIKE A WEDDING DRESS I SUPPOSE 
IT'S SOMETHING I'LL KEEP UNTIL THE END OF MY DAYS PROBABLY 
IT'S A VISUAL ART IT IS A VISUAL ART IT'S NOT JUST SOUND 
PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING THAT'S APPROPRIATE TO THE MUSIC 
BUT THAT'S GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT AND WHY NOT 
WHEN THE GIRLS CAME IN AFTER THEY'D DONE THEIR PERFORMANCE 
I DREW ATTENTION TO THE FACT THEY WERE WEARING A NICE DRESS 
I DID GET A FAIR AMOUNT OF TUT TUT YOU SHOULDN'T DRAW ATTENTION TO IT 
YOU DON'T ASK THE BOYS WHERE THEY GOT THEIR TROUSERS THAT KIND OF STUFF 
BUT IT WAS ALL GOOD CLEAN FUN I PROMISE 
I HOPE YOU WON'T MIND IF I ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR DRESS 
OH THIS WAS MADE BY MY GRANDMOTHER 
WE CHOSE THE PATTERN AND THE MATERIAL AND SHE PUT IT TOGETHER 
HELPFUL RELATIVES WERE OFTEN CALLED IN AT THE LAST MINUTE 
FOR THOSE FASHION EMERGENCIES 
WE COULD NOT FIND A DRESS FOR ME TO WEAR AT THE FINAL 
IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO FIND CONCERT CLOTHES WHEN YOU'RE A FIDDLER 
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO HAVE ROOM TO MOVE YOUR ARMS 
THEY'VE GOT TO BE FLATTERING ETC 
AND HERE'S NICOLA LOUD NOW 
SHE'S WEARING A MARVELLOUS TURQUOISE DRESS 
WHICH I BELIEVE HER MOTHER HAS MADE FOR HER 
ESPECIALLY FOR TONIGHT'S CONCERT 
VERY NEAR TO THE FINAL A FEW DAYS BEFORE EVEN 
WE WERE STILL MAKING THIS DRESS THAT MY DAD STILL HAS 
IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO FASHION TOOK ON A MUCH BIGGER ROLE 
THE PROGRAMME HAD BEEN ON AIR FOR FOURTEEN YEARS 
AND THE POWERS THAT BE DECIDED THAT FASHION 
WAS JUST THE THING TO REINVIGORATE IT 
THE OTHER NEW DEPARTURE THIS YEAR INVOLVES THE CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT 
OF FASHION FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF CLASSICAL MUSIC 
WE'VE FOUND THAT LOTS OF YOUNG MUSICIANS AND YOUNG DESIGNERS FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THIS SUBJECT 
SO MUCH SO THAT WE'RE RUNNING A NEW COMPETITION FOR DESIGNERS ALONGSIDE YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
THERE WAS THIS STRANGE FASHION COMPETITION THAT WENT WITH IT 
I'M A GREAT FOLLOWER OF FASHION 
BUT THE TWO AREN'T COMPATIBLE 
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT FASHION IN THE CONCERT HALL RECENTLY 
AND NOT JUST FROM NIGEL KENNEDY THE BRIEF FOR THESE YOUNGSTERS 
WAS TO CREATE THE RIGHT THING TO WEAR WHEN PLAYING A CONCERTO 
NINETEEN NINETY TWO SAW A GRAND FINAL THAT ALSO INCLUDED SEVERAL FILMS 
CHARTING THE PROGRESS OF THE WINNING OUTFITS 
UNDER THE AUSPICIOUS GAZE OF DESIGNER PAUL SMITH 
DARK BLACK ON DARK GREY 
RIGHT DO YOU HAVE ANY OPINION ON THAT DO STRIPED TROUSERS WORRY YOU 
I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE WEARING STRIPES RIGHT 
GREAT GREAT 
FOR A TUBA SO IT'S THE JACKET I WANT TO SEE 
THEIR BIG IDEA WAS THAT FINALISTS WORE THEIR FABULOUS NEW OUTFITS FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THE YOUNGEST OF TONIGHT'S SOLOISTS FREDERICK KEMPF 
AND HIS CONCERT CLOTHES WERE DESIGNED BY GAYA SLIWINSKY 
BUT NOT EVERYTHING WENT TO PLAN 
YOU DOUBTLESS SPOTTED THAT IN THE END 
RACHEL BARNES DIDN'T WEAR THE DRESS DESIGNED FOR HER 
SHE FELT MORE COMFORTABLE IN HER REGULAR EVENING CONCERT DRESS 
IT DID SEEM TO ME TO BE GOING OFF IN TOO MUCH OF A TANGENT 
I THINK THEY WERE TRYING TO FIND NEW WAYS TO PRESENT IT 
AND APPEAL TO PEOPLE 
I'M A CONSERVATIVE I LIKE THINGS TO STAY THE SAME 
WHICH IS WHY I ENDED UP NOT PRESENTING THE PROGRAMME 
IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO AFTER FOURTEEN YEARS PRESENTING THE PROGRAMME 
HUMPHREY FINALLY SAID GOODBYE 
I DID IT 
LONG RUNNING FORMATS INEVITABLY TRY NEW THINGS TO KEEP FRESH 
EVEN IF THEY DON'T ALWAYS WORK 
EARLY ON IN THE PROGRAMME'S LIFE 
THE PRODUCERS MADE ONE CHANGE THAT HAS STAYED TO THIS DAY 
THE REAL LIFE PROFILE 
WE'LL TRAVEL UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY 
MEETING THE YOUNG COMPETITORS TAKING PART 
OBVIOUSLY HOW THEY'RE PLAYING 
AND THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCES THEY DELIVER THAT'S CRUCIAL 
AND THAT'S WHAT THE PROGRAMME'S ALL ABOUT 
BUT THE VIEWERS DO WANT TO KNOW WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY LIKE 
THEY WANT SOME IDEA OF THEIR PERSONALITY 
WELL BEFORE POP IDOL AND X. FACTOR 
YOUNG MUSICIAN HAS BEEN FINDING OUT WHAT MAKES A MUSICAL GENIUS TICK 
I'M STRUGGLING THROUGH A BOOK CALLED BEING AND NOTHINGNESS BY SARTRE 
GLASS ENGRAVING IS SOMETHING I'VE RECENTLY TAKEN UP 
BLUES RIFF 
MONEY 
OFTEN ALL THEY DISCOVERED 
WAS THAT YOUNG MUSICIANS WERE THE SAME AS OTHER TEENAGERS 
IS IT MUSIC TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALMOST EVERYTHING 
WELL NOT TO THE EXCLUSION OF ADOLESCENT LUST AND ALL THAT 
WHEN I DID THE COMPETITION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT 
THE B. B. C. CAME AND MADE LITTLE SHORT DOCUMENTARY FILMS ABOUT 
YOU KNOW THE NORMAL LIVES OF THE FOUR CONCERTO FINALISTS 
I GOT OFFERED A PLACE AT THE MENUHIN SCHOOL 
WHICH WAS VERY NICE FOR ME A BIT OF A SURPRISE 
BUT NEVERTHELESS I TOOK IT UP AND I'VE BEEN THERE FOR FIVE YEARS' 
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD IT WAS BRILLIANT 
IT WAS REALLY EXCITING 
HAVING A CAMERA CREW COME DOWN TO MY HOUSE IN WALES 
AND I JUST LOVED ALL THAT 
ALTHOUGH I THINK IT WOULD BE MY IDEA OF ROOM ONE HUNDRED ONE 
WOULD BE TO BE STRAPPED TO A CHAIR AND MADE TO WATCH ALL THAT AGAIN 
COS I JUST LOOKED LIKE A TERRIBLE PONCE 
IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THE PROGRAMME MADE ANOTHER HUGELY SUCCESSFUL CHANGE TO THE FORMAT 
THE ADDITION OF AN ENTIRELY NEW CATEGORY 
THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY FIVE FAMILIES WITHIN AN ORCHESTRA 
THE STRINGS THE WOODWIND THE BRASS 
KEYBOARD INSTRUMENTS LIKE PIANO AND CELESTA OR ORGAN 
AND THEN THERE IS THE PERCUSSION 
IT TOOK THE YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR COMPETITION UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
TO REALISE THAT ACTUALLY 
THERE SHOULD BE A PERCUSSION PART TO THE COMPETITION 
THAT PERCUSSIONISTS SHOULD BE WELCOME TO COMPETE 
JUST AS KEYBOARDISTS AND HARPISTS ARE 
I MUST SAY I WAS PRETTY SCEPTICAL WHEN PERCUSSION CAME IN 
BUT WHAT IT DID AND IT REALLY PROVED IDIOTS LIKE ME WRONG 
WAS THAT THERE WERE ACTUALLY 
AMAZINGLY TALENTED MUSICIANS OUT THERE 
PLAYING A WHOLE RANGE OF PERCUSSION 
ADRIAN SPILLETT ENTERED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
BRINGING WITH HIM THE BIGGEST KIT THE COMPETITION HAD EVER SEEN 
YOU'VE GOT SOME FUNKY PERSON 
I DON'T KNOW PARA DIDDLING OR PLAYING A GLASS HARMONICA 
OR JUST HAVING TEN NIPPLE GONGS 
THE SHEER WATCHABILITY OF THAT IT'S THEATRE 
I WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND I WAS THE FIRST PERCUSSIONIST TO WIN VERY FORTUNATELY 
AND HERE IS ADRIAN SPILLETT FROM SHREWSBURY 
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES PERCUSSIONISTS FACE 
IS THE MUCH SMALLER POOL OF MUSIC TO CHOOSE FROM 
YOU SPEND HOURS DOING EACH ROUND 
WORKING OUT WHAT TO PLAY 
THEN IT SAYS WHICH CONCERTO ARE YOU PLAYING 
AND MOST PERCUSSIONISTS DON'T REALLY KNOW 
WHAT CONCERTOS THERE ARE 
APART FROM THE SMALL HANDFUL OF THE REALLY FAMOUS ONES 
BUT IF YOU DO THE RESEARCH 
THERE'S CERTAINLY THE REPERTOIRE THERE TO COMPETE 
THE PIECE I PLAYED IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY SHOWBIZ 
AND IT CERTAINLY HELPED ME WIN I THINK MUSICALLY 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I TEND TO ENJOY MYSELF 
AND THAT COMES ACROSS TO THE AUDIENCE 
THAT'S WHAT GOT ME THROUGH 
HE GAVE EVERY OUNCE OF HIMSELF WITH THIS EXTRAORDINARY KIT 
HE WAS A BIT ROCK AND ROLL IT WAS GREAT 
AND HITTING THE LAST NOTE 
I REMEMBER THE SHOULDERS DROPPED WITH RELIEF 
THEN I REALISED HOW TIRED I WAS 
THE AUDIENCE WERE GOING WILD AND IT WAS AN AMAZING FEELING 
OVERWHELMING AND ALSO QUITE A RELIEF AS WELL 
COS YOU'VE BUILT UP SO LONG FOR THIS THING 
IT'S LIKE GETTING MARRIED 
EVEN WHEN I WON PEOPLE WERE WRITING IN TO THE RADIO TIMES SAYING 
HOW CAN YOU COMPARE PERCUSSION TO THE FLUTE 
SHE WAS FAR MORE MUSICAL THAN I WAS WHICH SHE PROBABLY WAS 
LIKE MANY PREVIOUS WINNERS 
ADRIAN QUICKLY ATTRACTED THE ATTENTIONS OF THE WORLD'S PRESS 
THE NEXT MORNING RADIO THREE RANG MY HOTEL ROOM AT EIGHT A M. 
THAT DIDN'T GO DOWN TOO WELL 
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN IT DAWNED ON ME 
PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT A SMALL PIECE OF ME 
TODAY WE'RE DELIGHTED TO WELCOME ADRIAN TO THE BLUE PETER STUDIO 
THE DAY AFTER THAT I HAD TO GO AND DO BLUE PETER WHICH WAS VERY FUNNY 
AND ALSO QUITE UNREAL I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE ON BLUE PETER 
BEING INTERVIEWED ON TELEVISION BECAME SOMETHING THAT A YOUNG MUSICIAN HAD TO LEARN TO COPE WITH 
HELLO HERE WE ARE ON THE POSH CHANNEL B. B. C. TWO AND MY GUEST 
THE FELLOW YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
NICHOLAS DANIEL CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU 
WHEN I WON IT THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PUBLICITY 
WHICH WAS FANTASTIC BUT UTTERLY OVERWHELMING 
WHEN YOU WIN SOMETHING LIKE THAT THINGS DO CHANGE OVERNIGHT 
IT'S QUITE INCREDIBLE 
WHAT THE TEAM DIDN'T REALISE AT THE TIME WAS JUST WHAT AN EFFECT IT WOULD HAVE ON THE WINNER 
THEY JUST DESIGNED THE COMPETITION AS A SHOWCASE AND IT TURNED OUT THE WINNER 
WOULD SUDDENLY BE DELUGED OF OFFERS TO PLAY AND TO RECORD AND SO ON 
SUDDENLY THEY'D BE LAUNCHED HEADLONG INTO THE MUSIC PROFESSION 
IT IS AN EXPLOSION YOUR PHONE RINGS THE WHOLE TIME WE ACTUALLY HAD TO TAKE OUR PHONE OFF THE HOOK 
BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE PUT IT DOWN IT WOULD RING AGAIN 
BUT OF COURSE IT DIDN'T HELP THAT WE WERE IN THE PHONE BOOK WHICH I WOULD DEFINITELY ADVISE ANYONE 
WHO WINS THIS COMPETITION DON'T STAY IN THE PHONE BOOK 
THERE WERE HUGE AMOUNTS OF LETTERS THAT ARRIVED AT MY DOOR 
I REMEMBER AFTER A WHILE IT JUST SAID NATALIE CLEIN WHO PLAYS THE CELLO IN ENGLAND 
AND THE POSTMAN KNEW WHERE TO FIND ME SO THAT WAS QUITE EXTREME 
YOU DO BECOME PART OF PUBLIC PROPERTY IN A WAY 
FOR SOME WINNERS THE MEDIA ATTENTION PROVED HARDER TO DEAL WITH 
IT WASN'T EASY 
HAVING TO CONFRONT ALL THESE THINGS AND MAKE SENSE OF THEM 
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING TO GIVE PERFORMANCES FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IT WAS AND IS A HUGE CHALLENGE 
CLARINETTIST MARK SIMPSON IS THE REIGNING CHAMPION TAKING THE TITLE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
LIKE MOST YOUNG MUSICIANS MARK WAS STILL AT SCHOOL WHEN HE ENTERED 
AND HAD TO BALANCE THE DEMANDS OF THE COMPETITION WITH HIS EVERYDAY LIFE 
I WON IT AGED SEVENTEEN IT WAS LITERALLY THREE DAYS BEFORE MY GERMAN A LEVEL EXAM 
SO I WAS DOING MY A LEVELS WHILE I WAS DOING YOUNG MUSICIAN 
WHEN I FIRST ENTERED I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GOING TO BE 
A COMPETITION WHICH RESULTED IN A FINAL WHICH WOULD BE BROADCAST 
ON TELEVISION PLAYING WITH A PROFESSIONAL ORCHESTRA 
AND HAVING THE TITLE 
AND THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE THINK YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR IS 
B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
MARK SIMPSON 
IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT IT'S A CAREER IT'S A LIFESTYLE 
YOU'RE SUDDENLY IN DEMAND AS AN INSTRUMENTALIST AS A SOLOIST 
MARK FOUND HIMSELF IN THE POSITION OF MANY PAST WINNERS 
STRUGGLING TO FIND TIME TO SATISFY A HUNGRY PUBLIC 
THE AMOUNT OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE GIVEN TO YOU 
IT JUST INCREASES TENFOLD 
THE FIRST DAY I MOVED INTO MY STUDENT ACCOMMODATION I DID PROMS IN THE PARK AT HYDE PARK 
BY NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THE B. B. C. HAD DECIDED IT NEEDED TO OFFER MORE SUPPORT TO YOUNG WINNERS 
YOU REALLY NEEDED SOMEONE FULL TIME TO DEAL WITH THE PHONE CALLS COMING IN 
AND SOMEBODY WHO KNEW A BIT ABOUT MUSIC TO HAVE AN IDEA 
OF WHETHER ONE SHOULD ACCEPT ALL THESE ENGAGEMENTS WHAT SORT OF FEE WAS APPROPRIATE TO ASK 
OR WHETHER TO EVEN ASK A FEE 
SO THE PROGRAMME ENROLLED YCAT THE YOUNG CONCERT ARTISTS TRUST 
TO HELP GUIDE ALL WINNERS TO THEIR NEW FOUND FAME 
YCAT IS A CHARITY SET UP TO IDENTIFY NURTURE AND PROMOTE YOUNG CONCERT PERFORMERS 
EXTRAORDINARILY OUTSTANDING SOLOISTS AND CHAMBER MUSICIANS 
SOMEONE LIKE YCAT WE CAN HELP THEM 
WE CAN NEGOTIATE FOR THEM WE CAN BE IN BETWEEN AND WE CAN SUGGEST TO THEM 
THAT PERHAPS DOING FIVE CONCERTS IN A ROW ISN'T A GOOD IDEA 
IT'S VERY GOOD OF YCAT TO ADVISE WHAT'S GOOD AND WHAT'S BAD 
LIKE DON'T DO THAT JOB IN THE OUTER HEBRIDES BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO THAT PROM 
IT'S SIMPLE THINGS 
IT'S SO IMPORTANT THERE'S SOMEONE IN THE PROFESSION HELPS THEM MAKE THEIR CHOICES 
SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YCAT BUT IF THEY HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING ELSE THEN YCAT'S HERE FOR THEM 
I THINK THE B. B. C. OWE THAT TO THEM 
A DUTY OF CARE FOR THE COMPETITORS HAD BECOME A VITAL PART OF THE WAY YOUNG MUSICIANS 
IS NOW RUN BUT THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE COMPETITION HAS ALWAYS THROWN UP ISSUES 
THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO CRITICISED US WHO SAID IT'S NOT FAIR 
TO PUT THE SPOTLIGHT ON YOUNGSTERS SO EARLY IN THEIR CAREERS 
I WATCHED IT ON TELEVISION AND I ASKED MUM IF I COULD GO ON FOR IT 
SO I HAVE 
IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO HANDLE VERY CAREFULLY 
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT MOST WINNERS WILL SAY THE SAME THING 
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF WINNING A COMPETITION LIKE THAT AT A TENDER AGE 
YOUNG MUSICIAN HAS NO LOWER AGE LIMIT AS LONG AS YOU'VE REACHED GRADE EIGHT YOU'RE ELIGIBLE 
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT AND SENSITIVE TIME FOR ANY MUSICIAN COS YOU HAVE TO KEEP GROWING AT THAT TIME 
KEEP STUDYING AND TO HAVE TO DO THAT IN THE SPOTLIGHT CAN BE A STRAIN 
THE VIOLIN AND THE PIANO BOTH ARE THE INSTRUMENTS THAT SOMEHOW SPAWN GENIUS AT A YOUNG AGE 
THE YOUNG VIRTUOSO IS PART AND PARCEL HAS BEEN FOR CENTURIES 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE COMPETITION SAW JUST HOW YOUNG A TALENTED MUSICIAN COULD BE 
AT JUST ELEVEN YEARS OLD BENJAMIN GROSVENOR IS THE YOUNGEST PERFORMER EVER TO GET THROUGH 
TO THE FINAL OF THIS COMPETITION 
WELL WHAT A MOMENT IN THIS YOUNG MAN'S LIFE 
ONE KNEW THAT THESE PEOPLE HAD IT THERE IT WAS ALREADY A SPIRITUAL QUALITY A MUSICALITY 
WHICH WAS NOT AWARDING POTENTIAL WAS AWARDING ALREADY PERFORMANCE SO I'M NOT 
AGAINST EIGHT YEAR OLDS TAKING PART IF THEY'RE GOING TO DELIVER 
IT'S ALWAYS MORE EXCITING WHEN SOMEBODY LIKE BENJAMIN GROSVENOR 
THIS AMAZING YOUNG PIANIST OR JENNIFER STURGEON 
THEY COME THROUGH AND THEY'RE ONLY TWELVE OR THIRTEEN 
I AM ALL FOR THE YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR EMPHASISING YOUTH 
GREAT SO HOW DO YOU FEEL 
ERM 
IT'S QUITE HARD TO PLAY THAT YEAH IT'S DRY 
IN TWO THOUSAND TWO TWELVE YEAR OLD JENNIFER PIKE BECAME THE YOUNGEST MUSICIAN TO ACTUALLY WIN THE TITLE 
I ENTERED REALLY JUST FOR EXPERIENCE 
BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY FAZE ME AT ALL OFTEN PEOPLE THINK 
GOD SHE WAS SO YOUNG AND I HOPE SHE DOESN'T WIN BECAUSE IT'LL BE SO DIFFICULT 
WHICH I FULLY UNDERSTAND BUT I FELT READY THEN 
I HAPPENED TO BE ON THE ADJUDICATING PANEL FOR THE STRINGS SEMI FINAL 
WHEN JENNIFER WAS IN IT 
AND I REMEMBER THERE WAS A REAL BUZZ AROUND THE PANEL 
AND WE JUST KNEW THAT THIS WAS A GIRL WHO HAD SOMETHING 
VERY VERY SPECIAL INDEED 
AND ALSO SOMETHING VERY VERY SINCERE AND AUTHENTIC 
BUT OF COURSE WE WERE WELL AWARE OF HER AGE AND AWARE OF THE KIND OF EXPOSURE THAT COMES FROM 
GETTING A LONG WAY IN THE YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
WE SUSPECTED THAT SHE'D PROBABLY GO ON TO WIN IT 
WHICH SHE DID SO WE WERE RIGHT THERE ANYWAY I FEEL SMUG ABOUT THAT 
JENNIFER PIKE TWELVE YEARS OF AGE FROM CHEADLE IS THE B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN OF TWO THOUSAND TWO 
SHE STARTED PLAYING THE VIOLIN WHEN SHE WAS FIVE SHE'S ONLY JUST STARTED PLAYING ON FULL SIZE VIOLINS 
WHAT AN HONOUR FOR HER 
I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD DECISION I THINK SHE'S EXCEPTIONALLY TALENTED 
I THINK THEY'VE CHOSEN VERY WELL 
IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITH 
ALL THE B. B. C. ORCHESTRAS AND IN THE WIGMORE HALL AND ALL THESE VENUES ABROAD IT'S JUST 
IT HAS BEEN AN IMMENSE EXPERIENCE 
SHE'S HANDLED IT ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANTLY AND SHE'S TAKEN IT VERY VERY SENSIBLY 
AND REALISED THAT WHAT SHE HAS TO STRIVE TO DO EVERY DAY IS NOT TO DO AS MANY INTERVIEWS 
IN MAGAZINES AS POSSIBLE BUT TO PRACTISE AND TO GET BETTER 
AND TO STUDY AND TO BROADEN HER REPERTOIRE 
AND TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE AND THAT SHE'S DOING 
AND SHE'S GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY FINE BUT NOT EVERYBODY WILL HANDLE IT IN THE SAME WAY 
SO WHAT DOES WINNING THE COMPETITION MEAN FOR THE FUTURE OF A BUDDING MUSICIAN 
IT WAS BASICALLY A HUGE LAUNCH PAD REALLY 
AND I THINK WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO THAT KIND OF HUGE TITLE IS REALLY HUGELY HELPFUL 
IT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE PUBLICITY YOU GET FOR IT 
I MEAN ANY COMPETITION THAT GIVES YOU TELEVISION COVERAGE HAS TO BE IMPORTANT 
LAST QUESTION WHAT'S YOUR AMBITION 
UM TO BE A TROMBONIST IN A GOOD PROFESSIONAL ORCHESTRA 
MIKE HAS ACHIEVED HIS AMBITION PLAYING WITH SOME OF THE BEST ORCHESTRAS IN BRITAIN 
AND MANY OF THE PREVIOUS WINNERS HAVE GONE ON TO FORGE HUGELY SUCCESSFUL CAREERS IN MUSIC 
THE TRACK RECORD OF WINNERS HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
THEY'VE EITHER GONE ON TO BE SOLOISTS FOR 
OR FULFIL THE TOP POSITIONS AT ORCHESTRAS AND CHAMBER MUSIC 
SO IT HAS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL COMPETITION 
I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE HAD ANYTHING LIKE THE CAREER I'VE GOT WITHOUT IT 
IT'S THE MOST AMAZING PIECE OF P. R. TO LAUNCH A CAREER SO LOOKED AT VERY CYNICALLY 
IT'S THE BEST POSSIBLE START A MUSICIAN COULD HAVE 
THIS YEAR'S COMPETITORS ARE HOPING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY 
HUNDREDS HAVE ENTERED YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
HOPING TO CLINCH THE TITLE AND THE GLITTERING CAREER THAT CAN COME WITH IT 
EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER WATCHING THIS COMPETITION ON THE TELEVISION 
I ALWAYS JUST THOUGHT I WANT TO BE THERE ONE DAY I WANT TO BE STANDING THERE WITH THE REST 
OF THE COMPETITORS DOING MY BEST AND SEEING HOW FAR I CAN GET 
AFTER MONTHS OF REGIONAL HEATS AND SEMIS THE EIGHT BEST FROM EACH OTHER FIVE CLASSES 
HAVE MADE IT TO THE ROYAL WELSH COLLEGE OF MUSIC AND DRAMA IN CARDIFF 
FOR THE NEXT ROUND 
I'M FEELING RATHER NERVOUS THIS MORNING 
BUT I'VE KINDA CALMED DOWN A BIT NOW AND I'LL PROBABLY GET ANOTHER SURGE OF BUTTERFLIES BEFORE I GO ON 
I'M ALWAYS UNCERTAIN BEFORE PLAYING A CONCERT AND ESPECIALLY THERE'S SO MUCH PRESSURE NOW THIS TIME 
EVEN MORE NERVOUS THAN I USUALLY AM 
THE PRESSURE'S ON TECHNICAL ABILITY AND SHEER CHARISMA MUST COME TOGETHER 
TO CONVINCE THIS YEAR'S PANEL TO PUT THEM THROUGH TO THE NEXT STAGE 
FOR ME THERE WAS A STANDOUT PERFORMER 
AT TIMES MY HEART WAS IN MY MOUTH I THOUGHT OH 
SUCH A TALENT AND SUCH A STAR 
OH MY GOD 
IT FEELS GREAT TO HAVE GOT HERE BUT I THINK I REALLY WANT TO GO ONE STEP FURTHER 
THE CHANCE TO TAKE PART IN THE GRAND FINAL AND EVEN TAKE THE TITLE IS BECOMING TANTALISINGLY CLOSE 
THE FINALISTS ARE 
I'D LOVE TO GET THROUGH TO THE FINAL WHO WOULDN'T AFTER GETTING THIS FAR 
TO WIN THE OVERALL COMPETITION THAT WOULD BE REALLY QUITE SOMETHING WOULDN'T IT 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK MOST BRITISH MUSICIANS WOULD DREAM ABOUT 
SO TO HAVE A POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING YOU IT'S MIND BLOWING 
THIRTY YEARS LATER YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR CONTINUES TO PLACE ITS FAITH 
IN THE TALENTS AND ASPIRATIONS OF BRITISH YOUTH 
IT'S A FANTASTIC THING IN THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY ABOUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY 
IT DOES SEEM TO FIND STUDENTS 
FROM EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY THROUGHOUT THE U. K. 
AND CREATES A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL OF THEM 
DESPITE THEIR DISPARATE BACKGROUNDS 
SINCE ITS VERY FIRST YEAR 
IT'S ATTRACTED SOME OF THE FINEST MUSICIANS IN THE COUNTRY 
SO MANY GOOD MUSICIANS HAVE COME FROM IT 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK 
THAT THEY'VE BEEN BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE FOR THIRTY YEARS 
IT'S GIVEN US PERFORMANCES THAT HAVE CAPTIVATED THE BRITISH PUBLIC 
I THINK WE OWE A LOT TO THAT PROGRAMME 
FOR JUST BRINGING CLASSICAL MUSIC INTO A WIDER AUDIENCE 
IT'S DEARLY LOVED BY ITS PUBLIC OF ALL AGES 
STARTING FROM VERY YOUNG TO VERY OLD AND THAT'S PRETTY UNIQUE 
IT'S BECOME AN INSTITUTION AND HAS UNCOVERED 
SOME OF THE GREATEST FIGURES IN BRITISH MUSIC TODAY 
WHAT'S SO SUCCESSFUL IS THAT IT DID CAPTURE THE PUBLIC'S IMAGINATION 
AND I'M NOT SURPRISED IT'S LASTED ALL THIS TIME 
IT REMAINS THE TITLE UPCOMING MUSICIANS WANT TO WIN 
WELL PEOPLE LIKE A COMPETITION DON'T THEY 
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS ONE 
AND THAT'S THE END OF AN EPIC AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED 
IT'S FIFTY YEARS SINCE I STARTED WORKING IN TELEVISION 
SO I'VE HAD A FEW UPS AND DOWNS 
AND I THINK YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
IF I WAS ACTUALLY PRESSED TO IT WOULD BE THE THING I'M PROUDEST OF 
AND CONTINUES TO REINVENT ITSELF FOR EVERY NEW GENERATION 
HERE IS SOMETHING TO WARM THE COCKLES OF THE HEART 
IT PROVES THAT THE MUSICAL LIFE OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY IS IN RUDE HEALTH
