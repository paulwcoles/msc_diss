IF YOU WERE TO BUY THESE WHAT WOULD YOU BE PREPARED TO PAY 
SOME FRUIT CAKE OF A B. B. C. PRODUCER HAS SENT ME OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE 
ON THE BASIS THAT I CAN FIND ANTIQUES ANYWHERE 
WELL APART FROM A FIELD FULL OF WINTER BARLEY AND A MOST ENORMOUS 
HEAP OF COW MANURE AND A FEW ANTIQUATED TELEGRAPH POSTS I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING 
STILL I SUPPOSE WE'D BETTER GO BARGAIN HUNTING HADN'T WE 
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING APART FROM AN OLD R. A. F. BASE 
HANG ON A SEC THIS LOOKS PROMISING 
ANTIQUES COME ON 
THIS IS IT WE COULD BE IN BUSINESS 
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU CAN FIND ANTIQUES PRACTICALLY ANYWHERE 
AND WHAT A GREAT PLACE TO FIND THEM 
THIS IS THE HEMSWELL ANTIQUES CENTRE JUST OUTSIDE LINCOLN 
WHERE OUR BARGAIN HUNTERS HAVE JUST ONE HOUR TO SPEND THREE HUNDRED TO TRACK DOWN THREE ITEMS 
THAT WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE THEM A PROFIT AT AUCTION AND ANY PROFIT THEY MAKE THEY GET TO KEEP 
ANY LEFTOVER LOLLY WILL BE GIVEN TO THEIR EXPERTS TO SPEND 
ON A BONUS BUY WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BOOST THEIR PROFITS 
TODAY WE HAVE TWO TEAMS OF VERY VERY GOOD FRIENDS 
AT LEAST THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT 
FOR THE REDS WE'VE GOT SARAH AND LIZ AND FOR THE BLUES WE'VE GOT TO JOAN AND MARY 
WELCOME TO BARGAIN HUNT NOW YOU TWO GIRLS TODAY'S GOING TO BE A BREEZE FOR YOU ISN'T IT 
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO BE A BREEZE 
I HAVE HAD ANTIQUE UNITS IN THE PAST 
YOU'RE AN ANTIQUE DEALER 
WELL I DIDN'T MAKE ANY MONEY OUT OF IT WHY WAS THAT 
I ONLY BOUGHT THINGS I REALLY LIKED MYSELF AND THEN I COULDN'T PART WITH THEM SO I KEPT EVERYTHING 
ALL THE NICE THINGS YES 
AND I PUT ALL MY RUBBISH ON THE STALL AND NOT SURPRISINGLY I DIDN'T SELL MUCH 
WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO A BETTER PERFORMANCE TODAY 
NOW I'M GOING TO MOVE ON TO MY NEXT QUESTION WHICH REVOLVES AROUND BATTERED OLD CHAIRS 
WHY BATTERED OLD CHAIRS 
WE LIKE RENOVATING THEM 
IT'S A HOBBY WE SHARE TOGETHER 
WE LIKE RENOVATING CHAIRS 
SARAH DOES PAINT EFFECT YES I DO PAINT EFFECTS 
YOU CAN BAG SCRAG RUB 
I DO CRACKLER AND SORT OF DISTRESS 
GOT YOUR OWN MAGNETIC HAMMER

STAPLE GUN THAT'S NO GOOD HONESTLY 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT WITH US TODAY THESE GIRLS 
NOW FOR THE BLUES JOAN AND MARY HI GIRLS

JOAN LOOKS AFTER THE SMALL ONES 
SHE SENDS OUT A WONDERFUL FLEET OF LIBRARY VANS 
TELL US ABOUT BOOK START 
BOOK START IS A FANTASTIC SCHEME 
IT'S A NATIONAL SCHEME IT PROVIDES BOOKS FOR CHILDREN ZERO TO FOUR YEARS 
I ADMINISTER IT IN LINCOLNSHIRE

IT'S ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC I COULD GO ON FOR YEARS ABOUT IT 
DO WE'VE GOT THE WHOLE PROGRAMME 
WE'VE GOT THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR ACTUALLY ANYWAY IT'S ONE OF YOUR PASSIONS IT IS 
I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT IT MARY YOU HAVE THE SAME SORT OF PASSIONS DON'T YOU YES I LOVE BOOKS 
MY HUSBAND COMPLAINS BECAUSE I JUST ACCUMULATE THEM AT HOME 
HE DOESN'T KNOW I'VE GOT A LOT MORE STORED AT WORK THAT I'M GOING TO BRING HOME HE DOES NOW 
I LIKE TO TEST DRIVE THE BOOKS BEFORE I SEND THEM OUT TO PEOPLE YOU'VE ALSO GOT A CLAIM TO FAME 
WHEN I WAS A SCHOOLGIRL THAT'S A FEW YEARS BACK I LIVED IN CORNWALL IN NEWQUAY AND THE BEATLES CAME 
THEY WERE FILMING MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR 
THEY CAME TO STAY IN A HOTEL IN NEWQUAY 
I BUNKED OFF SCHOOL AND WENT TO MEET THEM ALL 
THE GIRL I WENT WITH KNEW THE PEOPLE WHO OWNED THE HOTEL SO WE GOT IN AND ACTUALLY MET THE BEATLES 
DID YOU WE TOOK PART IN THE FILMING AND EVERYTHING IT WAS GREAT FUN 
WORTH ALL THE TROUBLE AFTERWARDS 
I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS THEY WERE VERY VERY GOOD 
NOW THE MONEY MOMENT THREE HUNDRED WHO'S GOING TO TAKE THE THREE HUNDRED YOU KNOW THE RULES YOUR EXPERTS AWAIT 
OFF YOU GO VERY VERY GOOD LUCK 
SO I WONDER IF THEY'LL TURN UP ANY BEAUTIES 
SOUNDS JUST LIKE TODAY'S EXPERTS 
HOPING TO STAY OUT OF HOT WATER FOR THE REDS IT'S THOMAS PLANT 
AND ARMED WITH A VAST ANTIQUE KNOWLEDGE AND HIS LIBRARY CARD 
IT'S DAVID BARBY 
THE REDS AREN'T HANGING AROUND 
THEY ALREADY HAVE THEIR FIRST ITEM LINED UP 
I HEAR YOU GUYS HAVE GOT A BIT OF AN OBSESSION 
AN UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAIRS 
WE BOTH LOVE CHAIRS BOTH LOVE THEM I THINK LIZ HAS GOT A LARGER COLLECTION THAN MYSELF 
HOW MANY HAVE YOU GOT I'VE GOT NINETEEN DINING CHAIRS I JUST CAN'T RESIST THEM 
I'VE BOUGHT ANOTHER FOUR THIS WEEK ART NOUVEAU SIMILAR STYLE TO THESE 
I JUST LOVE THEM THESE ARE GORGEOUS VERY NICE I LOVE THEM DO YOU KNOW WHAT MOVEMENT THEY ARE 
ARTS AND CRAFTS EXACTLY SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY ART NOUVEAU 
THE BRITISH REALLY NEVER TOOK THE ART NOUVEAU 
WE DID BUT IT WAS REALLY RESTRAINED THESE ARE TYPICAL OF THAT PERIOD 
THIS ARTS AND CRAFTS CUM ART NOUVEAU PERIOD 
THEY DATE FROM ABOUT I WOULD SAY LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS 
JUST MY PERIOD I LOVE THIS KIND OF FURNITURE 
YOU'VE GOT THIS VERY SIMPLE BASE 
WONDERFULLY MADE GREAT CONSTRUCTION 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THESE CHAIRS WOULD BE USED FOR 
THEY'RE NOT DINING CHAIRS THEY'RE NOT STURDY ENOUGH FOR DINING CHAIRS 
A SORT OF ORNATE BEDROOM CHAIR 
WE SAY NOW THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE SAY BEDROOM CHAIRS FOR LITTLE SMALL CHAIRS LIKE THIS 
BUT IN FACT SINGLE CHAIRS OR SMALL CHAIRS 
THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE I DON'T THINK EVER A CHAIR WAS MADE FOR A BEDROOM THEY ARE PARTICULARLY SMALL 
THEY WOULDN'T BE LARGE ENOUGH FOR PILING THE CLOTHES UP 
IF YOU WERE TO BUY THESE WHAT WOULD YOU BE PREPARED TO PAY 
I WOULD THINK 
SEVENTY FIVE FOR THE PAIR 
REALLY I'D BE PLEASED WITH THAT 
IT'S SO NICE HAVING A PAIR 
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S GREAT HAVING A PAIR 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE COULD PROBABLY GET THEM FOR ABOUT SIXTY ISH 
ROUND ABOUT THAT BRACKET I THINK WE'VE GOT A CHANCE 
THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD ABSOLUTELY SHALL WE GO FOR IT 
LET'S GO FOR IT LET'S GO AND HAVE A CHAT O. K. 
NOW NOW THOSE CHAIRS AREN'T FOR YOU LADIES REMEMBER 
THE REDS BAGGED THE CHAIR PAIR FOR SIXTY FIVE 
IS THIS THE ONE 
YES THAT'S IT IT'S BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT 
IT'S LOVELY GOSH THAT'S A VERY GOOD CHOICE ISN'T IT 
IT'S SO DELICATE IT IS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THESE WERE BASICALLY 
GLASS LEFT OVER AT THE END OF THE DAY IN A BOTTLE FACTORY AND THEY STARTED MAKING THESE 
THEY'RE SO INTRICATE YEAH BUT THIS IS LOVELY 
IT HAS THAT RUSTIC ELEMENT THAT I LIKE 
I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL I THINK IT'S NICE HAVE A FEEL OF IT 
THE SHAPE IS JUST BEAUTIFUL IT'S JUST LOVELY TO HOLD 
IT'S VERY TACTILE ISN'T IT YES IT IS 
ORGANIC ISN'T IT REALLY 
LET'S THINK BACK TO THE VICTORIAN PERIOD 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SORT OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY WHEN THESE WERE MADE 
THEY WERE USED BASICALLY AS PAPERWEIGHTS 
LARGE ONES WERE BY THE DOOR AS DOORSTOPS BUT THIS IS A PAPERWEIGHT 
I WOULD IMAGINE IN YOUR PROFESSION YES YES LIBRARIANS 
SO YOU NEED SOMETHING TO KEEP ALL THAT PAPERWORK IN ORDER CERTAINLY DO 
A VERY PRACTICAL LITTLE OBJECT I THINK IT'S LOVELY 
I THINK IT'S LOVELY IT JUST FEELS WONDERFUL TO HOLD IT DOES 
YES IT IS THERE ARE COLLECTORS OF THESE 
IN FACT I HAVE QUITE A LARGE COLLECTION AT HOME 
PEOPLE LIKE TO PUT THEM ON SHELVES UP AGAINST A WINDOW LIGHT SO YOU'VE ALL THESE GLASS COLOURS 
SHINING THROUGH LITTLE BUBBLES I THINK IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL 
I'M GOING TO CAST A CLOUD 
OH YES OH DEAR 
IT'S THE PRICE THIS IS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO PAY FOR ONE OF THESE 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A PRICE 
O. K. YOU'VE GOT TO COME TO WELL UNDER ONE HUNDRED WELL UNDER ONE HUNDRED 
I THINK THIS WILL SELL FOR ABOUT NINETY WE HAVE TO HAGGLE 
WE'RE GOOD AT THAT NEGOTIATE LET'S SAY NEGOTIATE 
SMILE NICELY 
THERE YOU ARE IT'S UP TO YOU OFF YOU GO LADIES NEGOTIATE THAT PRICE

BIRMINGHAM NINETEEN NINETEEN WHY DID YOU LIKE IT IT'S PRETTY AND IT FEELS NICE 
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL HERE 
THIS WONDERFUL SWAG DECORATION THIS OPEN CARTOUCHE THIS PRETTY BOW 
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT IT COULD BE USED AGAIN IT'S QUITE NICE A NICE TWENTY FIRST PRESENT 
EXACTLY THE INTERIOR IS LOVELY 
I'D PUT ALL MY PLASTIC IN THERE ALL YOUR PLASTIC 
SO WE'VE GOT AMERICAN EXPRESS DINERS CLUB AMEX AND THE ALL IMPORTANT THE MARTINI CLUB IN THERE AS WELL 
AND THE GYM WHICH WE HAVEN'T QUITE GOT TO YET AS YOU CAN SEE 
DON'T STOP IT STOP DOING YOURSELVES DOWN 
WHAT'S THE PRICE ON IT 
IT WAS EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY NINE 
EIGHTY NINE THE FIGURE'S AROUND NINETY QUID 
UM IT'S ENOUGH 
IT'S ENOUGH IT NEEDS TO BE 
DO YOU WANT ME TO HAVE A CHAT NO NEED NO NEED IT'S ALL RIGHT 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO NEED WE'VE ALREADY BOUGHT IT YEAH 
WHAT NO YOU'RE JOKING ME WE WEREN'T WASTING TIME THERE WAS A QUEUE BEHIND US 
A QUEUE OF PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY NINE BEHIND YOU WILLING TO TAKE THIS DEFINITELY WE HAD TO HAVE IT 
WHAT DID YOU BUY IT FOR WE GOT A BARGAIN DIDN'T WE EIGHTY SIX 
THREE 
WOO HOO BREAK OUT THE CHAMPAGNE 
THREE OFF 
I DON'T THINK HE'S VERY PLEASED 
EIGHTY SIX COME ON LET'S GO AND GET SOMETHING ELSE AND LET ME DO THE BARGAINING THIS TIME 
HERE'S SOMETHING TO GET YOUR SPECULATIVE JUICES GOING 
PARTICULARLY IF YOU COME FROM DOWN UNDER HAVE A LOOK AT THIS LOT 
YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'VE GOT TWO EYEBALLS AND THOSE EYEBALLS ARE FILLED WITH LITTLE CHIPS OF OPAL 
THE OPAL CHIPS SIT IN A RING OF GOLD WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT 
PROBABLY BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE HERE IS A HIGH QUALITY GIFT 
PERHAPS PRIME MINISTER MENZIES ON ONE OF HIS FOREIGN TOURS 
PRESENTED THIS OBJECT TO A FAMOUS PERSON 
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A BUTTON HERE 
THE BUTTON WOULD HAVE CONNECTED WITH AN ELECTRICAL CONTACT 
IF YOU WANTED TO SUMMON THE SERVANTS YOU'D PRESS THAT BUTTON 
AND IT WOULD SEND ITS SIGNAL OFF TO THE KITCHEN 
IT LOOKS AS IF IT'S MADE OF SOLID SILVER I RATHER HOPE IT IS 
IF IT IS MADE OF SOLID SILVER IT MUST BE WORTH BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED 
THE PRICE HERE IN THE ANTIQUES CENTRE IS EIGHTEEN 
THAT'S WHY I SAY YOUR SPECULATIVE JUICES SHOULD BE FLOWING 
RIGHT MATE 
NOW WHAT I THINK ATTRACTS THE EYE INITIALLY IS THE WAY THESE OBJECTS ARE DISPLAYED 
WHEN YOU CAME INTO THIS ROOM DID YOU SEE THESE IMMEDIATELY 
WELL YES YES WE DID YES 
DISPLAY IS SO IMPORTANT ISN'T IT I WAS VERY TAKEN WITH THEM BEING A CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN 
THE CHILDREN AND THE WAY THEY'RE POSITIONED 
THIS LITTLE CHAP IS PRECARIOUSLY 
PERCHED ON THE TOP OF THIS MILK JUG 
THAT'S THE HANDLE ISN'T IT YEAH IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
I FOLLOW THAT 
THEY'RE DELIGHTFULLY SORT OF VICTORIAN KITSCH 
THEY HAVE THAT FUN ELEMENT THESE WERE ALL MADE IN GERMANY ROUND ABOUT THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY PERIOD 
YOU CAN TELL THIS THERE'S ONE HERE 
WITH THE MARK WHICH IS JUST THERE CAN YOU SEE THAT 
IT'S BARELY VISIBLE BUT IT'S A WAISTED SHIELD A SHIELD THAT GOES IN AT THE SIDE 
THAT'S THE MARK FOR CONTE AND BOEHM 
THEY WERE A PORCELAIN COMPANY PREDOMINANT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THEY ALSO MADE SOME VERY FINE PORCELAIN BUT THEY ARE KNOWN FOR THESE NOVELTY PIECES 
IT'S UNUSUAL TO HAVE CHILDREN CLAMBERING OVER THESE SORT OF CONDIMENTS 
I THINK THEY'RE QUITE DELIGHTFUL SO WE'VE GOT A MILK JUG THERE SALT 
HERE THERE WE MIGHT HAVE MUSTARD AND THEN THESE ARE IN FACT VESTAS 
THE MATCHES WOULD GO IN THERE AND YOU'D STRIKE THEM 
SO A NICE LITTLE COLLECTION 
ARE THEY ALL BEING OFFERED AS ONE 
THEY'RE ALL IN A LOT TOGETHER 
HE WANTS TO SELL THEM ALL O. K. 
I THINK IT'S ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE FOR ALL SIX RIGHT RIGHT 
JUST THINK IF ONE OF THOSE WAS PUT UP FOR AUCTION YOU'D GET SOMETHING IN THE REGION OF EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY 
THAT SORT OF PRICE RANGE 
YOU'VE GOT TO WORK ON AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY EACH ITEM 
THAT MEANS YOU'VE GOT TO BRING IT DOWN FROM ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
OH RIGHT 
ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT 
IT'S QUITE A DROP ISN'T IT IT IS QUITE A DROP 
LET'S HOPE THE DEALER IS BEING KIND TO US TODAY 
SO DO I 
THE BLUES CAUGHT THE DEALER IN A GOOD MOOD AS THEY GOT THE VICTORIAN FIGURINES FOR ONE TWO THREE 
DOH RAY ME A B. C. ONE TWO THREE 
BARGAIN HUNT LOOKS EASY WHEN YOU WATCH IT ON THE TELLY DOESN'T IT 
WELL IT ISN'T IF YOU THINK YOU COULD DO BETTER THAN THESE GUYS 
THEN LOG ON TO OUR WEBSITE 
COME AND JOIN US 
ONE TWO THREE 
AS SIMPLE AS DOH RAY ME 
A B. C. ONE TWO THREE 
BABY YOU AND ME GIRL 
SO YOU TWO GIRLS ARE REALLY QUITE INTERIOR SAVVY AREN'T YOU 
WITH YOUR COLLECTION OF CHAIRS AND YOUR CRACKLE GLAZE 
I'VE COME ACROSS SOMETHING WHICH YOU MIGHT NOT IMMEDIATELY THINK IS GOING TO BE FASHIONABLE TODAY 
BUT I THINK IT'S GOT A CERTAIN TYPE OF STYLE AND APPEAL WHICH COULD WORK WELL WITH THE MODERN INTERIOR 
I LOVE THE TRAY THE TRAY IS NICE BEAUTIFUL SHAPE 
IF I MENTIONED A WORD TO YOU LIBERTY'S HAVE YOU HEARD OF LIBERTY'S YES 
THIS IS WHERE THIS HAS COME FROM IT'S A LIBERTY TEA SET AND TRAY 
THE REASON I CAN TELL YOU THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S MADE BY A FIRM CALLED TUDRIC 
EVERY PIECE HERE IS HELPFULLY MARKED 
AS WE CAN SEE ON THE BASE IT SAYS TUDRIC PEWTER WARE 
CAN YOU SEE IT'S GOT FIVE NUMBERS ON THE BOTTOM 
OH ONE OH SEVEN FIVE REMEMBER THAT NUMBER THEY'VE ALL GOT THE SAME 
IT'S A MATCHING FOUR PIECE TEA SET 
THE TRAY IS MATCHING AS WELL 
OR SO YOU THINK BUT IF I TAKE THESE OFF 
YOU CAN SEE OH TWO FIVE THIS TRAY HERE IS AN EARLIER TRAY 
IT PROBABLY WAS BOUGHT AT THE SAME TIME 
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AS A WEDDING PRESENT PROBABLY IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
BUT THIS TRAY WAS PROBABLY DESIGNED IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
AND I RECKON THIS TRAY WITH THAT LOW NUMBER WAS DESIGNED BY OLIVER BAKER 
HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST DESIGNERS FOR LIBERTY ON THE TUDRIC RANGE 
AND QUITE AN IMPORTANT DESIGNER HIS STUFF DOES FETCH SOME MONEY 
I DON'T THINK THE DEALER HAS REALISED THIS IS AN EARLIER TRAY WITH A LATER TEA SET 
BUT I'M SURE IT WAS MADE AND BOUGHT AT THE SAME TIME 
ABSOLUTELY 
I'M CONVINCED ALMOST THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY BOUGHT AS A WEDDING PRESENT FOR SOMEBODY 
NOW PRICE 
I'VE DONE THE RIGHT THING I'VE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE DEALER 
I HAVEN'T JUST GONE AHEAD AND BOUGHT I'M PLAYING A FAIR GAME HERE 
I'VE HAD A CONVERSATION 
IT WAS MARKED UP AT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT 
I'VE GOT IT DOWN QUITE A BIT 
I'VE GOT IT DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED FORTY QUID 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THAT SOUNDS THAT SOUNDS GOOD IT'S A GOOD DEDUCTION 
NEARLY AS GOOD AS OURS YOUR THREE DEDUCTION TO MY 
THIRTY TWO OURS WAS UNDERPRICED YOU THINK SO 
TRADE PRICE BEST POSSIBLE PRICE WELL SHALL WE GO 
AND I CAN'T GO SHOPPING WITH THAT COME ON YOU LOT 
WELL DONE THOMAS FOR SHOWING THE LADIES HOW TO SHOP 
THAT WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY PAID FOR THE TEA SET 
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT IT'S GREEN AGAIN 
NO I'D SAY THAT WAS MORE BLUE 
SHALL WE COMPROMISE AQUAMARINE O. K. YEAH 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT'S LOVELY 
THIS IS A CHINESE GARMENT POSSIBLY MADE FOR A MANDARIN FAMILY 
BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN WORN BY IMPORTANT PEOPLE 
THIS IS SO RICHLY EMBROIDERED I WONDER WHETHER IT WAS MADE 
FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION LIKE A WEDDING A MARRIAGE GARMENT 
IT REALLY IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL WOULD YOU WEAR THIS TODAY 
PROBABLY NOT NO I'D BE VERY TEMPTED TO BECAUSE IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
BUT PERHAPS NOT VERY PRACTICAL 
I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE IT ON A WALL HUNG UP WITH ALL THIS WONDERFUL EMBROIDERY 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S EXQUISITE IT REALLY IS 
THE DETAIL IS AMAZING THESE BUTTERFLIES THEY'RE SUPERB 
IT'S ALL BEAUTIFULLY DONE 
I DON'T THINK THIS HAS EVER BEEN WORN OR ON DISPLAY 
I BET IT WAS BOUGHT BACK FROM CHINA PROBABLY BEFORE THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
KEPT IN A BOX WITH TISSUE PAPER AND LAVENDER 
IT IS IN PRISTINE CONDITION 
MY FATHER WAS IN THE R. A. F. AND HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE FAR EAST 
AND SENT BACK SOME WONDERFUL SILKS FOR MY MOTHER TO HAVE MADE UP 
I CAN REMEMBER ONE IN PARTICULAR WHICH WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL COLOUR 
A PURPLE BUT VIBRANT LIKE THIS NEEDS TO BE TRIED ON COME ON 
THE CHANGING ROOM IS OVER THERE 
I HOPE IT'S THE RIGHT SIZE IT'LL BE JUST RIGHT 
I THINK SHE'S GOING TO LOOK ABSOLUTELY SUPERB 
SHE'LL LOOK MARVELLOUS 
I THINK THE COLOURS REALLY SUIT HER 
I TAKE HER SHOPPING A LOT I HOPE SHE DOESN'T POP HER HEAD AROUND THE CORNER AND ASK FOR ANOTHER SIZE 
OH MARY IT LOOKS SUPERB 
IT'S WONDERFUL 
IT'S JUST YOU IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
IT FEELS COMFORTABLE TO WEAR 
IF WE WERE SHOPPING I'D HAVE TO MAKE YOU BUY THAT 
WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON A PRICE 
YES THAT'S THE DRAWBACK 
IT'S EIGHTY FIVE WHICH IS SO RIDICULOUS CONSIDERING THE WORKMANSHIP THAT'S GONE INTO IT 
IT'S GOING TO BE SOLD AT AUCTION LET'S TRY AND GET IT A BIT LOWER MORE BARGAINING 
I'M RELUCTANT FOR THEM TO SEE YOU IN IT BECAUSE YOU LOOK SO WONDERFUL 
COME ON 
THE BLUES PAID SEVENTY FIVE FOR THE MANDARIN SILK DRESS 
AND JUST IN TIME AS THE SIXTY MINUTES ARE UP 
LET'S HAVE A RECAP OF WHAT THE REDS BOUGHT 
SARAH AND LIZ LOVE THEIR CHAIRS AND THEY DIDN'T DISAPPOINT 
WITH THIS DUO SNAPPED UP FOR SIXTY FIVE 
LET'S HOPE THEY FILL UP THIS WITH PROFIT 
THE REDS PICKED UP THE SILVER PURSE FOR EIGHTY SIX 
WHAT A LIBERTY 
THE TEA SET WAS THEIR FINAL BUY ADDED TO THEIR STASH FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
GIRLS HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE YOU'VE GOT THAT OFF PAT 
SO NINE CHANGE I MEAN THIS IS AMAZING YOU CAN SHOP YOU GIRLS 
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU GOT THAT THAT IS PATHETIC ISN'T IT 
I'VE NEVER GIVEN ANYONE ANY CHANGE BEFORE HAVE YOU NOT 
YOU'RE LUCKY REALLY WELL THOMAS WILL BE THE LUCKY ONE 
WHICH ITEM IS GOING TO BRING THE BIGGEST PROFIT 
I THINK THE TEA SET DO YOU AGREE 
NO I THINK THE SILVER PURSE 
THAT'S COS SHE CHOSE IT YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE GOOD FRIENDS 
HERE WE GO THOMAS NINE I'M HONOURED 
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET A QUICHE LORRAINE AND A CUP OF TEA DOWNSTAIRS 
MY CHOICE HAS BEEN RATHER NARROWED 
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS PLACE YOU COULD BUY FOR NINE SOME FAUX FRUIT 
FAUX WHAT FRUIT 
I'LL DO MY BEST YOU'LL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING 
ANYWAY LET'S REMIND OURSELVES WHAT THE BLUES BOUGHT 
THE BLUES GOT UNDERWAY WITH THIS PAPERWEIGHT 
BUT WILL IT HOLD DOWN ANY CASH AT AUCTION 
THE VICTORIAN NOVELTY TABLE SET WAS NEXT UP BOUGHT FOR AN EASY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE 
MARY JUST HAD TO BUY THE MANDARIN DRESS AFTER SHE TRIED IT ON 
AND THE BLUES GRABBED IT FOR SEVENTY FIVE 
SO GIRLS YOU SPENT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT YES 
PLEASE MAY I HAVE TWENTY TWO BACK 
IT'S A GOOD OLD SPEND UP 
WE CAN SPEND WHEN WE TRY YES WE CERTAINLY CAN 
WHICH ITEM IS GOING TO BRING THE BIGGEST PROFIT OH I THINK THE CHINESE COAT 
NO I THINK IT'S LOVELY BUT I DON'T THINK IT'LL BRING THE BIGGEST PROFIT 
I THINK THE VICTORIAN DUMP 
WE GOT A GOOD MARKDOWN ON THAT YES WE DID 
A GOOD MARKDOWN ON YOUR DUMP 
ANYWAY WE HAVE A LITTLE CONTROVERSY THERE 
NOW TWENTY TWO OLD FRUIT 
NOT AN AWFUL LOT IS IT WERE THEY DIFFICULT TODAY 
NO DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE AND VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE WERE THEY 
THAT'S FRIGHTENING ISN'T IT 
BUT CHALLENGING ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING FOR TWENTY TWO 
THERE'S LOADS HERE IS THERE YEAH VERY GOOD LUCK 
WE'LL SEE YOU AT THE AUCTION I SHALL BE DELIGHTED 
JUST AS DELIGHTED AS I AM TO HEAD OFF TO RENISHAW HALL 
IF YOU WANT TO SEE A FINE EXAMPLE OF A CLASSIC ENGLISH COUNTRY HOUSE 
THEN LOOK NO FURTHER THAN RENISHAW HALL IN DERBYSHIRE 
JUST LOOK AT THAT HOW COULD ANYBODY NOT FIND THAT ELEVATION BEAUTIFUL 
INDEED MANY VISITORS TO RENISHAW OVER THE YEARS HAVE FOUND IT EQUALLY ENTHRALLING 
ONE PARTICULAR CHARACTER WHO WAS ENCHANTED BY RENISHAW WAS JOHN PIPER 
ARGUABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST BRITISH TWENTIETH CENTURY ARTISTS 
AND SOME OF HIS FINEST WORKS ARE ON DISPLAY HERE 
THERE ARE PIPER PAINTINGS SCATTERED ALL AROUND RENISHAW 
BUT HERE IN THE FRONT HALL WE CAN SEE A PARTICULARLY GOOD SELECTION 
JOHN EGERTON CHRISTMAS PIPER WAS BORN AND BROUGHT UP IN EPSOM AND TRAINED AS A LAWYER 
HE WAS BULLIED INTO IT BY HIS SOLICITOR FATHER 
BUT WHEN HE DIED IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE PIPER TOOK UP ART FULL TIME 
HE WAS AN INCREDIBLY TALENTED FELLOW 
HE DID SET DESIGN AND STAINED GLASS DESIGNS 
AND IF YOU EVER GO TO COVENTRY CATHEDRAL 
THE HUGE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS WERE DESIGNED BY JOHN PIPER 
IT WASN'T UNTIL THE SECOND WORLD WAR THAT HE DISCOVERED HIS REAL LOVE 
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT STARTED THE WAR ARTISTS' SCHEME 
WHERE THEY COMMISSIONED VARIOUS ARTISTS INCLUDING PIPER 
TO PAINT BUILDINGS BEFORE AND AFTER THEY WERE BOMBED 
HE PAINTED ALL SORTS OF INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUILDINGS 
INCLUDING SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL AND HARDWICK HALL 
IT WAS THEN HE BECAME FRIENDLY WITH SIR OSBERT SITWELL 
AND VISITED RENISHAW ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS 
THESE THREE PAINTINGS SHOW A VARIETY OF VIEWS OF THE HOUSE 
THE STABLE FRONT THE NORTH FRONT AND THE SOUTH FRONT 
JUST LOOK AT HIS TREATMENT OF THE PAINT 
THE DARK AND SOMBRE EFFECTS 
YOU CAN ALMOST FEEL THE GERMAN BOMBERS ABOUT TO PASS OVERHEAD 
ON A RAID OVER SHEFFIELD 
THE TOP PAINTING IS OF THE SOUTH FRONT 
WHERE WE STARTED OUR TOUR OF RENISHAW 
I WONDER WHETHER YOU THINK IT LOOKS LIKE THAT TODAY 
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL A LASTING IMPRESSION 
NOW LET'S FIND OUT HOW THINGS ARE HOTTING UP OVER AT THE AUCTION 
WELL IT'S GRAND TO BE HERE AT MELLORS AND KIRK SALEROOM 
IN NOTTINGHAM WITH NIGEL KIRK VERY NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK 
NOW THE PAIR OF RUSH SEATED ARTS AND CRAFTS CHAIRS 
I HAVE TO SAY I QUITE LIKE THESE 
DO YOU YES I DO 
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THEY COULD BE BY LIBERTY'S 
BUT IF IT COULD BE ESTABLISHED THEY WERE THE PRICE WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE 
WAS IT PART OF A BIGGER SUITE 
I THINK THESE ARE CHAIRS FROM A BEDROOM SUITE PERHAPS A WARDROBE BED DRESSING TABLE 
BUT VERY NICE TO HAVE THESE TWO SURVIVORS NOT TOO BIG IN GOOD CONDITION 
GOOD ORIGINAL CONDITION THEY NEED TO BE LEFT ALONE 
IF THEY WERE RESEATED THAT WOULD PUT SOME PEOPLE OFF 
GUESS A PRICE SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED 
VERY GOOD SIXTY FIVE THEY PAID 
THAT'S MARVELLOUS 
RIGHT THE PURSE AND CHAIN 
I PARTICULARLY DISLIKE THESE BITS OF SILVER 
I QUITE AGREE THEY'RE SO USELESS AREN'T THEY 
WELL SOME ARE AND SOME AREN'T SOME ARE MORE COLLECTABLE 
FOR EXAMPLE VESTA CASES CAN MAKE HUGE PRICES 
AND THEY'RE NO BETTER OR WORSE THAN THESE LITTLE PURSES 
WHICH ARE JUST UNCOMMERCIAL AND NOT PARTICULARLY COLLECTIBLE 
UNCOMMERCIAL THAT'S THE WAY TO PUT IT 
SO AS AN UNCOMMERCIAL OBJECT SOLID SILVER 
BEAUTIFULLY MADE BUT SO WHAT THIRTY TO FIFTY 
OUCH EIGHTY SIX THEY PAID OH DEAR THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT A LOT OF DOUGH 
THE QUESTION IS ARE THEY GOING TO EARN IT BACK ON THIS TUDRIC HAMMERED PEWTER TEA SET 
IT'S POSSIBLE 
IT'S UNDOUBTEDLY A GENUINE LIBERTY AND AMP CO TUDRIC PEWTER TEA SERVICE 
PROBABLY DESIGNED BY OLIVER BAKER 
IF IT HAD BEEN A SHADE EARLIER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLAIN AND NOT HAMMER TEXTURED AND MUCH MORE SALEABLE 
I THINK THEY'LL BE DOING WELL TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK 
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT MAKE SEVENTY TO NINETY 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY THEY PAID A BIT OF A BLACK HOLE HERE 
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THEIR BONUS BUY LET'S LOOK AT IT 
SARAH LIZ YOU SPENT TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE WHICH IS A MAMMOTH AMOUNT OF MONEY 
ONLY LEAVING THOMAS WITH NINE SMACKERS 
WHAT DID YOU SPEND IT ON TOM LOTS OF CAKE NO I GOT A VERY NICE 
I DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY YOU DO UNDERSTAND 
A PRESERVE JAR AND COVER WITH A CONTINENTAL SILVER SPOON 
EDWARDIANA AT ITS BEST 
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR IT 
THE PRINCELY SUM OF EIGHT 
EIGHT THAT'S SO TOUGH TO ONLY HAVE NINE 
HE WAS LUCKY HE HAD THAT IT'S BY PARAGON SO IT'S A GOOD MAKER 
QUITE FASHIONABLE TODAY 
I'VE JUST DONE MY KITCHEN THAT COLOUR 
SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY CONTEMPORARY SHE HAS SUCH GOOD TASTE 
I DO ACTUALLY WILL IT MAKE ANY PROFIT WELL YES 
BECAUSE YOU ONLY GAVE ME NINE THAT MEANS I SPENT EIGHT 
I HAD A POUND FREE I KIND OF THINK IT COULD MAKE TEN 
WE'RE LOOKING AT TWO PROFIT OR TWELVE 
OR TWELVE OR FIFTEEN FIFTEEN BUT IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT COULD MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE 
AT THAT LOW LEVEL ONCE YOU GET THE BIDDING STARTED THEY GET HOOKED 
I THINK YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL TOM 
LET'S FIND OUT WHETHER THE AUCTIONEER LIKES IT 
STILL IF YOU ONLY HAVE NINE TO SPEND AND THAT'S TAKEN EIGHT OF THEM IT'S NOT TOO BAD 
ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD TRY 
IT'S PARAGON VERY TYPICALLY NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE NINETEEN THIRTY 
DIFFICULT TO SELL 
IT IS BUT IT'S COST VERY LITTLE TO BEGIN WITH WILL IT MAKE A PROFIT 
I'D HOPE SO I'D HOPE S. TO 
ANYWAY THE BLUES 
WHAT ABOUT THIS DUMP OR PAPERWEIGHT PAPERWEIGHT 
LATE VICTORIAN 
PROBABLY MADE IN YORKSHIRE 
THESE WERE MADE IN HUGE QUANTITIES DIFFERENT SIZES 
SOME WERE AS BIG AS A FOOTBALL OTHERS ARE EVEN SMALLER THAN THIS 
THE LARGE ONES OF COURSE ARE DOORSTOPS THIS SIZE WOULD BE USED AS A PAPERWEIGHT 
HOW MUCH TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE 
OH DEAR EIGHTY PAID THAT'S A LOT THAT'S A BIG LOSS ISN'T IT YES 
DAVID BARBY GOT FRIGHTFULLY KEEN ABOUT THIS LITTLE DINING TABLE SET 
ABSOLUTELY THEY ARE ALL CLEARLY BY THE SAME MAKER 
AND I THINK ONE OF THEM THIS ONE YES THIS ONE 
THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY MARKED AND THE MARK IS THAT OF THE CONTE AND BOEHM FACTORY IN GERMANY 
VERY INVENTIVE 
NOT OF ANY REAL QUALITY BUT JUST WHIMSICAL NOVELTIES 
I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE CAT 
THE CAT HAVING THE CREAM IN THE CHURN 
ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE ANY CREAM IN THE AUCTION IS THE QUESTION THEY'RE WORTH TEN OR FIFTEEN APIECE 
SO THERE'S SIX OF THEM THERE 
THAT'S NINETY QUID NINETY QUID ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE PAID SO NOT A LOT OF PROFIT 
NOW NIGEL THIS IS NOT THE GHOST OF ONE OF YOUR CHINESE ANCESTORS BEHIND YOU NO IT'S A GOWN 
IT IS INDEED PRODUCING CHINESE WHISPERS OF COURSE 
THIS IS I THINK PROBABLY NINETEEN TWENTIES NINETEEN THIRTIES RATHER THAN ANY EARLIER 
THE QUALITY IS MAGNIFICENT 
IT'S EMBROIDERED SILK IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE A LOVELY STATE OF PRESERVATION 
WHAT WOULD IT COST TODAY TO EMBROIDER A BIT OF SILK LIKE THAT 
A SMALL FORTUNE WHAT'S IT WORTH RIGHT NOW 
SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE PAID 
SO THEY STAND A REASONABLE CHANCE OF MAKING A PROFIT ON THAT 
ANYWAY LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THEIR BONUS BUY 
SO JANE AND MARY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT DOWN THE DRAIN OR UP THE SPOUT DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LIKE TO LOOK AT IT 
AND YOU GAVE DAVID TWENTY TWO WHAT DID YOU SPEND IT ON DAVID 
WELL IT WASN'T A LOT OF MONEY TIM 
BUT I'VE GOT TWO LITTLE OBJECTS THAT I'M GOING TO REVEAL NOW OH YES 
OH THEY'RE FANTASTIC 
WELL KEEPING THE IDEA OF ORIENTAL WITH THE WONDERFUL OUTFIT YOU BOUGHT 
THESE ARE TWO LITTLE JAPANESE SATSUMA BUTTONS HAVE A LOOK AT THEM 
THEY ARE FANTASTIC ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL MINUTE DETAIL 
QUITE SWEET TELL US ABOUT SATSUMA THEN 
THAT'S CERAMICS ISN'T IT YES IT'S A JAPANESE POTTERY 
IT HAS A FEATURE OF CRACKLE GLAZE 
BUT THE ACTUAL DETAIL ITSELF IS EXQUISITELY DONE 
AND THEY'RE JUST TWO LITTLE BUTTONS MADE FOR THE EUROPEAN MARKET 
PROBABLY ROUND ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED NINETEEN OH FIVE 
SO EXQUISITELY MADE JAPANESE KIND OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTIES 
WHAT DID YOU PAY FOR THEM TWENTY 
FANTASTIC THAT'S A BARGAIN ISN'T IT 
WELL HE ONLY HAD TWENTY TWO BUT WELL DONE ANYWAY HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THEY'LL MAKE 
I'VE SEEN THEM GO FOR ABOUT FORTY EACH AT AUCTION HOUSES REALLY EACH 
OH MARY BUTTON COLLECTORS HERE WOULD PAY THAT SORT OF MONEY 
BUT THERE'S NO OTHER BUTTONS IN THE SALE TO ATTRACT THEM OH RIGHT 
ON THAT HAPPY NOTE FOR YOU AT HOME LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS OF THE BUTTONS 
DEFINITELY BUTTONS ABSOLUTELY ARE THEY WORTH WASHERS 
THEY'RE WORTH BUTTONS JAPANESE JAPANESE 
SATSUMA EARTHENWARE AND I SUSPECT ORIGINALLY A SET OF SIX PRESUMABLY 
RATHER GOOD FUN ACTUALLY BUTTONS ARE COLLECTIBLE BUT THESE AREN'T SPECIAL REALLY IN ANY WAY 
SO I SUPPOSE TEN TO TWENTY IS THE PRICE FOR THAT WELL TWENTY THEY PAID 
AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A BONUS BUY THAT ARE GONNA BRING AN ENORMOUS PROFIT IN THE AUCTION OH NO NO 
IT'S AMAZING THE CROCKERY OF INTEREST THAT YOU CAN FIND IN SOME OF THESE SALES 
FIFTY TO EIGHTY IS THE ESTIMATE ON THIS LOT AND JUST LOOK WHAT YOU GET INSIDE 
A HANDSOME VICTORIAN STANDING FLAT BACK FIGURE 
WELL NOT QUITE ACTUALLY IT'S BROKEN IN TWO 
AND THAT'S THE POINT MOST OF THE THINGS IN THIS BOX ARE BUST 
IF YOU TAKE THAT VASE LOVELY ROYAL DOULTON 
PAINTED EARTHENWARE VASE GREAT SLENDER TAPERING FORM 
PAINTED BY HAND DATING FROM AROUND ABOUT NINETEEN TEN TO NINETEEN TWENTY 
THIS POT FOR CERTAIN OUGHT TO BE WORTH BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED 
LOOK AT THE TOP RIM THOUGH SADLY A WHOLE LUMP HAS BEEN REMOVED 
SO WHAT'S THAT WORTH BROKEN 
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER ACTUALLY 
KEEP DELVING IN THE RUMMAGE PIT HERE

LOOK AT THAT GREAT BIFF IN IT IT COMES FROM AN OXFORDSHIRE POTTERY IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
THIS LITTLE POT IS BY BURMANTOFTS 
YOU CAN SEE THE BURMANTOFTS MARK UNDER HERE 
IT'S GOT TWO TINY LITTLE CHIPS AND THAT ONE ON ITS OWN I SUPPOSE IS WORTH ABOUT FIFTY QUID 
HERE WE'VE GOT A PERFECTLY ORDINARY DUCKY GERMAN TILED TEAPOT STAND 
AND TO CAP IT ALL A REALLY EXQUISITE PIECE OF MEISSEN PORCELAIN 
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE AROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY OR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY 
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE IN ITS DAY 
LOOK AT THAT GORGEOUS SPRAY OF FLOWERS 
IF YOU TURN IT AROUND AGAIN SADLY A LUMP OUT OF IT 
THIS TIME REPAIRED WITH STAPLES 
SO WHAT SHOULD YOU DO ABOUT THESE MIXED CHEAP LOTS OF CERAMICS 
FRANKLY IF YOU WANTED TO BUY ALL THESE THINGS IN GOOD CONDITION IT WOULD COST YOU A SMALL FORTUNE 
IF YOU'VE GOT A DISPLAY CABINET THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO FILL WITH EXQUISITE PIECES 
TURN A LOT OF THESE THINGS ROUND SO THAT THE CHIPS FACE THE WALL 
AND YOU COULD THEN STILL HAVE A PERFECTLY ATTRACTIVE DISPLAY
