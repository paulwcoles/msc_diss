FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE HAMMER FINALLY FALLS 
I'M ON MY WAY TO MEET SHANNON WAALDIJK 
SHE'S CALLED IN THE TEAM COS SHE'D LIKE TO SPEND SOME QUALITY TIME 
WITH SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN HER LIFE 
SHANNON WAALDIJK HAS ENJOYED COLLECTING ANTIQUES SINCE HER UNIVERSITY DAYS 
BUT NOW SHE FEELS IT'S TIME TO DE CLUTTER 
SO WITH THE HELP OF HER FRIEND SARAH 
LET'S HOPE WE CAN FIND SOME ITEMS TO RAISE THOSE FUNDS 
MORNING JONTY GOOD MORNING HOW ARE YOU 
I'M GOOD I HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR A FUN DAY'S RUMMAGING COS WE'RE ABOUT TO MEET A REALLY SPARKLY LADY 
SOUNDS VERY GOOD TO ME 
SHALL WE GO LET'S GO 
GOOD MORNING YOU MUST BE SHANNON AND YOU MUST BE SARAH 
SO WHY HAVE YOU CALLED US IN 
WELL I WAS HOPING I COULD DE CLUTTER A LITTLE BIT 
YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF THINGS IN THE HOUSE 
I HAVE QUITE A FEW THINGS THAT I'VE COLLECTED OVER THE YEARS 
WHAT ARE YOU RAISING MONEY FOR 
WELL MY PARTNER HAS TWO DELIGHTFUL CHILDREN MILES AND ELLIOT 
AND WE ALL GET ALONG SO WELL WE THOUGHT WE'D TAKE THEM HORSE RIDING 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT THING TO DO 
SO HOW MUCH DO WE THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RAISE TODAY 
MAYBE FIVE HUNDRED OR SO 
FIVE HUNDRED OR SO SHE SAYS WITH A LITTLE HESITANCY 
WELL LET'S GO AND SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT 
AND LET'S FIND SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL US WHAT THEY'RE WORTH COME ON 
IN A HOUSE FURNISHED WITH HAND PICKED TREASURES 
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND ENOUGH THINGS TO FUND THAT QUALITY TIME 
THAT SHANNON WANTS TO SPEND WITH HER BOYFRIEND'S SONS 
BUT WE CAN'T DO IT ON OUR OWN 
WE NEED JONTY'S EXPERT EYE TO VALUE OUR FINDS JONTY 
THIS IS SHANNON WHOSE HOUSE IT IS AND HER FRIEND SARAH 
THIS IS WHAT I'VE SPOTTED ALREADY 
ISN'T IT TERRIFIC WHERE DID THIS COME FROM 
I THINK I BOUGHT IT IN AN ANTIQUES FAIR IN EPSOM MANY MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A STUDENT 
SO WHAT WERE YOU TOLD ABOUT IT WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT 
HE TOLD ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT BEING ART NOUVEAU AND MAYBE IT'S OAK 
YES WELL YOU'RE HALF CORRECT THERE 
THIS IS NOT ART NOUVEAU IN STYLE 
OH ISN'T IT THIS IS TUDOR STYLE 
THIS LINEN FOLD WAS USED I LOVE THE WORD LINEN FOLD 
HAVE A LOOK AT THAT DESIGN 
IT EXPLAINS IT CLEARLY THE SORT OF DECORATION THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT 
IT REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE FOLDED LINEN 
THIS IS A COPY AND I SUPPOSE A COPY MADE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
SO WE'RE TALKING PROBABLY BETWEEN THE WARS 
BUT THERE IS ONE LITTLE PROBLEM TO THIS LET ME SHOW YOU 
NOW LOOK WE'VE GOT A BIT OF DAMAGE ON THE BACK THERE 
I NOTICE SOME OLD GLUE SO HAS THAT BEEN AN OLD PROBLEM 
I TRIED TO FIX IT A LITTLE BIT BUT I HAVEN'T DONE IT VERY WELL 
I WOULD SUGGEST TO SEE WHETHER YOU CAN JUST PIN THAT UP 
SO IF YOU DO THAT FOR ME VALUE WISE WE'RE TALKING SIXTY TO EIGHTY AT AUCTION 
HOW LOVELY REALLY WHAT DID YOU PAY FOR IT 
MUCH LESS THAN THAT 
WELL SIXTY IS A GREAT START A GOOD START TO GET THE FUND RUNNING 
SHALL WE GO AND SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN FIND 
AND WE'RE OFF WITH OUR FIRST ITEM UNDER OUR BELT 
BUT WE NEED MANY MORE PRIZE THINGS TO TAKE TO AUCTION 
SO THAT SHANNON CAN TREAT MILES AND ELLIOT TO A FABULOUS DAY OUT 
AT THIRTY TO FIFTY THESE THREE EXQUISITELY DRESSED VICTORIAN BISQUE DOLLS ARE A FANTASTIC DISCOVERY 
BUT NO TIME TO PLAY JUST YET WE'VE STILL GOT A LONG WAY TO GO 
AND JONTY SEEMS TO HAVE FOUND AN INTERESTING PIECE TO REFLECT ON 
OH HI GIRLS HELLO JONTY 
MASSIVE MIRROR SHANNON CAN WE SELL IT TIS INDEED OH YES 
DID YOU PAINT THE FRAME 
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T 
WHEN A MIRROR LIKE THIS WAS MADE WHICH WAS PROBABLY TURN OF THE CENTURY 
THE MIRROR ITSELF SHOULD BE GILDED 
SO YOU'RE LITERALLY TALKING ABOUT VERY FINE LAYERS OF GOLD 
BUT AT SOME POINT SOMEONE'S GOT THEIR GOLD PAINT BRUSH OUT 
AND HAVE PAINTED IT GOLD WHICH I SUPPOSE DEVALUES IT REALLY 
I MEAN I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT IN LOVELY SHINY PROPER GOLD NOT THIS PAINTED VERSION 
THIS CAN BE RE PAINTED THIS CAN BE RE DECORATED 
IT CAN GO OFF TO THE AUCTION SALE AND IT'S STILL WORTH FIFTY TO SEVENTY 
WONDERFUL WHAT DID YOU PAY 
OH NOTHING NEXT TO NOTHING IT'S ALL ADDING UP ISN'T IT 
IT IS INDEED VERY GOOD NEWS 
I'M NOT GOING TO TOUCH IT ANY FURTHER I'M SURE IT WEIGHS A TON 
WE'LL GET THE REMOVERS TO GET THAT SORTED OUT ALL RIGHT 
OFF TO THE AUCTION SALE WONDERFUL 
LET'S CARRY ON SEARCHING THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
A WONDERFUL SURPRISE FOR SHANNON AND ANOTHER FIFTY TO SEVENTY TOWARDS THOSE HORSE RIDING LESSONS 
IT'S ALL GOING WELL AND WITH AN ESTIMATE OF BETWEEN THIRTY AND SIXTY 
AND NEEDING SOME RESTORATION 
THIS EXQUISITELY CRAFTED WALNUT CHAIR WILL ALSO GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
AS JONTY CONTINUES TO SEARCH HIGH AND LOW 
SHANNON AND I TAKE SOME TIME OUT IN HER BEAUTIFUL GARDEN 
SHE'S BEEN SEEING MICHAEL FOR TWO YEARS 
AND AT FIRST SHE WAS WORRIED THAT HIS CHILDREN MIGHT NOT ACCEPT HER 
BUT THEY ALL BONDED IMMEDIATELY 
TELL ME ABOUT THESE BOYS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT TO YOU 
MY PARTNER MICHAEL HAS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL TWO CHILDREN 
MILES AND ELLIOT AND THEY'RE VERY LIVELY 
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO GET THEM TO DO A BIT OF HORSE RIDING 
WE JUST HAD A FANTASTIC HOLIDAY IN COSTA RICA AND NICARAGUA WITH THE BOYS AND WE ALL GOT ALONG SO WELL 
AND WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM LIFE 
IT'S EASY GOING WE'RE ALL VERY HAPPY 
WELL I THINK WE SHOULD GO AND FIND JONTY 
AND LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE HE CAN FIND IN THE HOUSE FOR YOU 
WE MUST PUT ALL OUR EFFORTS INTO HUNTING OUT THOSE HIDDEN TREASURES 
SO THAT SHANNON CAN SPEND SOME FUN FILLED QUALITY TIME 
WITH THE THREE SPECIAL MEN IN HER LIFE 
HOPEFULLY THIS NEXT FIND OF A COLLECTION OF RARE BOOKS INCLUDING 
THE LIFE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY POET LORD BYRON WILL HELP 
ESTIMATED TO BRING IN UP TO FIFTY 
WE NEED SOME LITERATURE LOVERS TO TURN UP AT OUR AUCTION 
SHANNON'S HOUSE IS BURSTING WITH POSSIBILITIES 
BUT SOME OF THESE FINDS DO SEEM TO BE VERY CLOSE TO HER HEART 
GIRLS HAVE YOU FOUND SOMETHING 
WE'VE FOUND SOMETHING GOOD AND THERE'S A LOVELY STORY 
AS TO HOW YOU FOUND THIS YES INDEED 
WELL I PURCHASED IT FROM AN ANTIQUES FAIR IN WIMBLEDON 
BUT WHEN I PURCHASED IT IT HAD MUD ALL OVER IT 
WHY WAS THAT IT WAS QUITE A STATE 
IT WAS WATER DAMAGED 
SO IT HAD BEEN IN SOMEBODY'S HOUSE AND THEY'D HAD A FLOOD OR WHATEVER 
AND I COULD SEE IT STILL HAD THE METAL CASTORS 
BUT YOU'VE GROWN TO LOVE IT VERY MUCH 
I HAVE BUT IT'S JUST TOO HEAVY 
I THINK SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC IN LIFE 
AND EVEN THE THINGS YOU LOVE YOU HAVE TO LET THEM GO 
WELL LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT IT 
THANK YOU THE SHAPE 
THIS IS A DOUBLE ENDED SETTEE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE 
DATE WISE WE ARE LOOKING EARLY VICTORIAN O. K. 
SO THIS SETTEE IS OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OLD 
SO WHEN A DEALER SEES A SOFA LIKE THIS IN AN AUCTION ROOM 
THEY NEED TO ASSESS THE CONDITION OF THE FRAME 
NOW THAT SHOULD BE LOVELY FRENCH POLISH MAHOGANY 
INSTEAD IT HAS THIS DULL MATT APPEARANCE TO IT 
AND THE OTHER BIG ISSUE IS 
YES THE CONDITION OF THE UPHOLSTERY 
I WOULD ASSESS THIS NO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
REALLY YEAH 
OH WHAT A SHAME WHERE DID YOU I PAID ONE HUNDRED FOR IT DID YOU 
BUT ARE YOU GOING TO LET IT GO TO AUCTION OR NOT WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I OUGHT TO STOP BEING SENTIMENTAL AND BE PRACTICAL IT'S TOO HEAVY 
SO IS IT GOING TO GO OR STAY 
I THINK IT SHOULD GO 
IT SEEMS THAT SHANNON'S NOT COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT SHE WANTS TO PART WITH HER VICTORIAN SOFA 
BUT IF IT SELLS FOR THE TOP END OF THE ESTIMATE 
WE'LL BE WELL ON OUR WAY TO REACHING THAT FIVE HUNDRED TARGET 
WHILE SHANNON IS SIFTING THROUGH STUFF IN HER BEDROOM 
SHE PULLS OUT SOME GORGEOUS PIECES OF COSTUME JEWELLERY 
INCLUDING THESE SPARKLING MULTI STONED BROOCHES 
AT TWENTY TO FORTY THEY COULD PROVE TO BE VERY WELCOME AT AUCTION 
AND SHANNON'S REALLY PULLING OUT THE STOPS WITH HER NEXT FIND 
SOMETHING YOU WANTED ME TO HAVE A LOOK AT YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT IT BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK 
DO YOU KNOW IT ALL OPENS UP YES OH YES THERE WE GO 
THIS IS A WRITING SLOPE 
IF WE OPEN THIS COMPARTMENT WHAT HAVE WE GOT 
OOH LOOK WE'VE GOT AN INK POT WITH A CRACKED TOP THERE 
WONDERFUL OH YES 
ALL THESE COMPARTMENTS WOULD BE FOR YOUR PENS AND QUILLS 
ON THE UNDERSIDE HERE IF WE CAN GET IN I CAN JUST ABOUT 
THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT ALL YOUR LETTERS AND ENVELOPES 
O. K. YOUR STORAGE COMPARTMENT 
SO IT'S A VERY VERY CLEVERLY DESIGNED PIECE OF FURNITURE 
AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS IT'S FURNITURE RATHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
IT ALL FOLDS AWAY LIKE SO VERY VERY NEAT 
THIS IS VERY EARLY VICTORIAN 
SO THIS WRITING SLOPE IS ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY IN DATE OH GOOD HEAVENS 
SO HERE WE'VE GOT THIS LOVELY ROSEWOOD 
YOU SEE THE LOVELY GRAIN HERE 
ROSEWOOD HAS GOT THESE VERY DARK STREAKY LINES THAT RUN THROUGH IT 
AND WHAT'S IT INLAID WITH THEN 
HAVE A LOOK THIS ALL SHIMMERS 
I KNOW IT'S LOVELY MOTHER OF PEARL 
OOH IT'S LOVELY BUT IT'S CERTAINLY WORTH PUTTING INTO THE AUCTION SALE 
FIFTY TO SEVENTY WOW 
HIDING IN YOUR LOFT WONDERFUL WELL FOUND 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHALL WE GO THIS WAY O. K. 
WHAT A BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED PIECE OF HISTORY 
THIS COULD FETCH A GOOD PRICE AT AUCTION AND SEE US GALLOPING TOWARDS THOSE HORSE RIDING LESSONS 
WE'RE WORKING HARD ON TODAY'S SEARCH 
AND ANOTHER GREAT FIND THESE THREE ELEGANT VICTORIAN PARASOLS 
ESTIMATED TO FETCH BETWEEN TWENTY AND FIFTY 
JUST IMAGINE WHO MIGHT HAVE USED THESE 
TO SHADE THEMSELVES FROM THE SUN'S RAYS 
BUT NO TIME TO REMINISCE WE'RE STILL HARD AT WORK ON THE RUMMAGE 
AS THE DAY DRAWS TO AN END JONTY ASKS SHANNON ABOUT HIS LATEST FIND 
LET'S HOPE HE GIVES IT A FANTASTIC VALUE SO WE CAN REALLY BUMP UP THOSE FUNDS 
SO WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND HERE NOW JONTY 
I WAS LOOKING AT THIS DOUBLE ENDED SETTEE 
THIS IS VICTORIAN 
BUT IT'S SLIGHTLY LATER THAN THE OTHER SOFA THAT WE LOOKED AT O. K. 
THERE WE HAD THAT DOUBLE SCROLL END 
YOU KNOW WHERE HAVE THE SCROLL ENDS GONE 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE UPHOLSTERY HERE WE HAVE BUTTON BACKED UPHOLSTERY 
THIS BUTTONING CAME IN AS A FASHION DESIGN REALLY IN THE MID VICTORIAN ERA 
SO HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT A SETTEE THAT'S ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MAYBE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY IN DATE 
THE DOWNSIDE TO IT IS IT'S A VICTORIAN SOFA AND 
AT THE MOMENT THE MARKET FOR VICTORIAN DESIGN IS DEPRESSED 
YOU'VE GIVEN US THE BAD NEWS HOW ABOUT THE GOOD NEWS 
WHAT'S IT LIKELY TO FETCH AT AUCTION 
I SUPPOSE WE'RE TALKING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SO WE COULD BE SAVED 
SO WHAT DO YOU RECKON SHANNON IS IT GOING TO GO 
I THINK IF IT MADE THE UPPER AMOUNT I'D BE HAPPY 
SO DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT A RESERVE ON IT 
OH DEFINITELY IT WILL DEFINITELY HAVE TO HAVE A RESERVE 
PARTING WITH THE DAY BED IS GOING TO BE VERY HARD FOR SHANNON AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO LET IT GO EASILY 
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE SIX HUNDRED NINETY 
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED OVER OUR TARGET 
THAT'LL DEFINITELY GET MILES AND ELLIOT CHEERING 
WE'VE HAD A GREAT TIME ROOTING THROUGH SHANNON'S HOUSE 
AND FOUND SOME FASCINATING PIECES THAT SHE'S COLLECTED 
JUST LET'S REMIND OURSELVES OF WHAT'LL BE HEADING FOR AUCTION 
THIS PSEUDO ANTIQUE EXQUISITELY CARVED WOODEN TRAVELLING COFFER 
ESTIMATED TO FETCH BETWEEN SIXTY AND EIGHTY 
THE VICTORIAN ROSEWOOD WRITING SLOPE 
INLAID WITH MOTHER OF PEARL COULD SELL FOR BETWEEN FIFTY AND SEVENTY 
IN NEED OF RESTORATION BUT STILL A GLORIOUS FIND IS THE VICTORIAN LEATHER SOFA 
VALUED AT A FANTASTIC PRICE OF BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
STILL TO COME SHANNON GIVES SOME FIGHTING TALK 
WELL THEY'D BETTER BID HIGH AS WE LIVE THE LOWS 
DISAPPOINTING SOMEBODY'S GOT A GOOD BUY THERE 
AND THE HIGHS I'M DISAPPOINTED SHE'S ECSTATIC 
LOOK AT THE LOOK ON HER FACE 
AS OUR GOODS COME UNDER THE HAMMER 
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WE WERE IN SHANNON'S HOME LOOKING FOR ANTIQUES AND COLLECTABLES 
TODAY HERE WE ARE AT GAZE AND AMP SONS AUCTION ROOM AT DISS IN NORFOLK 
WHERE WE'RE HOPING THAT WE'RE GOING TO SELL THEM FOR AROUND FIVE HUNDRED 
BECAUSE THAT'S THE SUM THAT SHE WANTS SO THAT SHE CAN TAKE 
THE SONS OF HER PARTNER MICHAEL ON A SPECIAL DAY OUT 
SO WE'RE HOPING THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME SPECIAL BIDDING TODAY 
WHEN HER ITEMS GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
THE AUCTION HOUSE IS BUSTLING WITH ENTHUSIASTS AND COLLECTORS

AND ACROSS THE ROOM I SPY OUR VERY OWN EXPERT JONTY EYEING UP THE COMPETITION

WELL WE'VE GOT A COLLECTION OF SOFAS TODAY OR IS IT ONE OR TWO 
THERE'S A BIG QUESTION MARK OVER ONE OF THOSE SOFAS ISN'T THERE 
SHANNON ALL OF A SUDDEN 
I REMEMBER TALKING TO HER ABOUT THE SOFA 
I COULD SEE HER FACE SHE WAS FALLING IN LOVE WITH IT AGAIN 
COULD SHE REUSE IT COULD SHE RECYCLE IT 
AND INDEED I WONDER IF SHE'S MANAGED TO DO ANY REPAIRS TO THAT RATHER LOVELY OAK COFFER 
THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
SHALL WE GO AND SEE IF SHE'S BROUGHT THE HAMMER AND NAILS WITH HER 
AND I'VE SPOTTED SHANNON BUSY DOING WHAT SHE LOVES 
BROWSING ALL THE FINE ITEMS ON DISPLAY TODAY 
SHE'S BROUGHT HER PARTNER MICHAEL WITH HER FOR SOME MORAL SUPPORT 
SHANNON GOOD MORNING

IT'S BEEN ONE WEEK SINCE OUR DAY AT AUCTION 
AND SHANNON IS IN HIGH SPIRITS 
WITH THE TWO HUNDRED TWELVE THAT SHE MADE 
SHE'S ORGANISED A FABULOUS DAY FOR MICHAEL MILES AND ELLIOT 
SO IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO SADDLE UP AND ENJOY THE RIDE 
WELL WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE A NICE DAY OUT

GET ON WITH IT YES 
FIRST THERE'S SOME LIMBERING UP TO BE DONE

AND SHOW OFF WHAT THEY'VE LEARNT 
IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC DAY THE BOYS HAVE BEEN SO GOOD 
THEY'VE CLEARLY GOT A BIT OF A TALENT FOR RIDING 
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO US COMING BACK AGAIN
