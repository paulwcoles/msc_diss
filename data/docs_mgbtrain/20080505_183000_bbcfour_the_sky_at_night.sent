YOU'RE RIGHT 
ALL OF MODERN COSMOLOGY IS BASED ON THE IDEA 
THAT WE KNOW THERE WAS A BEGINNING 
GOOD EVENING THIS IS OUR SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIXTH PROGRAMME 
SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THE DEVIL'S NUMBER 
SO WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND 
I DON'T MEAN THE WITCH'S BROOM NEBULA 
OR THE GHOST OF JUPITER 
THINGS WE REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THEY BEAT US 
THEY'RE SO DEEP WILL WE EVER UNDERSTAND THEM 
OR IS THERE SOME REASON WHY WE CAN'T 
SOMETHING'S STOPPING US 
WITH ME THREE EXPERTS 
DOCTOR KATE LAND PROFESSOR GERRY GILMORE AND DOCTOR CHRIS LINTOTT 
I'M GOING TO BE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE SO LET'S GO TO YOU GERRY 
IN OUR COSMOLOGY EVERYTHING BEGINS WITH A BIG BANG 
THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN THOUSAND MILLION YEARS AGO 
ALL BASED ON THAT 
SUPPOSING THERE WASN'T A BIG BANG WHAT THEN 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
ALL OF MODERN COSMOLOGY IS BASED ON THE IDEA 
THAT WE KNOW THERE WAS A BEGINNING 
THAT'S BASED ON THREE PILLARS THREE FOUNDATIONS 
THE FIRST IS THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS DENSER HOTTER AND SMALLER LONG AGO 
THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING NOW LONG AGO IT WAS SMALLER 
SECONDLY IT'S BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE CAN SEE THE LEFT OVER HEAT FROM THAT ORIGIN 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE CALL THE COSMIC MICROWAVE HOW 
WELL IT'S T. V. FREQUENCIES ACTUALLY 
IT'S THE STATIC ON YOUR T. V. IN THE PRE DIGITAL DAYS 
THIS ROOM IS FULL OF THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND 
THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS SHINING WITH THIS STUFF 
AND IT'S JUST T. V. NOISE 
WE CAN MAP IT TO VERY HIGH PRECISION 
AND THE THIRD PIVOT OF THE BIG BANG IS THE ASH FROM THE BIG BANG 
WHICH IS THE ELEMENTS OF WHICH WE ARE MADE 
THE HYDROGEN THE HELIUM 
AND THE TINY TRACE OF LITHIUM THAT WAS LEFT OVER FROM THE BIG BANG 
SO WE CAN MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BIG BANG FROM ITS RADIATION 
THE MICRO BACKGROUND 
WE CAN MEASURE ITS AGE 
FROM THE RATE AT WHICH THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING NOW 
AND WE CAN MEASURE THE ASH THAT CAME FROM IT FROM THE LIGHT ELEMENTS 
THE FACT THAT THERE WAS SOME HOT DENSE EVENT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN BILLION YEARS AGO 
IS PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHED 
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT WHAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEFORE IT 
AND WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY SURE WE'VE GOT THE CORRECT DESCRIPTION OF IT 
AND WE DON'T HAVE MUCH IDEA WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER IT 
WAS THERE A BEFORE 
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED 
WE LIKE TO SAY TIME WAS CREATED AT THE BIG BANG 
I DON'T THINK WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FRAMEWORK TO EVEN ASK A QUESTION 
AS TO WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE BIG BANG 
THERE ARE SOME MODELS THAT DON'T HAVE A BEGINNING 
WHERE THE UNIVERSE IS ACTUALLY CYCLIC AND HAS AN INFINITE PAST 
BUT THE CONVENTIONAL MODEL IS THAT TIME BEGAN AT THE BIG BANG 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT SYSTEM 
WE CAN MAKE SENSIBLE COMMENTS BACK TO A FRACTION OF A SECOND JUST AFTER THE BEGINNING 
BUT IT'S TRUE THAT OUR THEORIES BREAK DOWN AT THE BEGINNING SO TO SAY ANYTHING SENSIBLE 
SO WE JUST DON'T KNOW THAT'S CORRECT 
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WE DO KNOW 
WHAT CONVINCES ME THAT THE BIG BANG IS CORRECT 
IS THAT WE LOOK BACK FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS DIFFERENT IN THE PAST 
WE SEE SMALLER GALAXIES ON AVERAGE 
WE SEE THEM FILLED WITH YOUNGER STARS 
AND WE SEE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE UNIVERSE WE KNOW TODAY 
THE FURTHEST WE CAN SEE IS WHAT GERRY TALKED OF 
THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND 
KATE WHY DO WE SEE THIS GLOW FROM THE BIG BANG AT ALL 
IT IS EFFECTIVELY THE HISS LEFT AFTER THE BIG BANG EXPLOSION 
YOU'RE SEEING THE RADIATION LEFT THE UNIVERSE WASN'T ALWAYS TRANSPARENT 
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE UNIVERSE WAS HOT AND DENSE ENOUGH 
THAT PHOTONS LIGHT PARTICLES COULDN'T TRAVEL FREELY THROUGH THE UNIVERSE 
THEY WERE CONSTANTLY SCATTERED FREE PARTICLES 
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE UNIVERSE COOLED TO ABOUT THREE THOUSAND KELVIN THAT IT BECAME TRANSPARENT 
IT'S LIKE LOOKING AT A CLOUD ON A CLOUDY DAY 
YOU CAN'T SEE INSIDE THE CLOUD YOU CAN ONLY SEE THE EDGE OF THE CLOUD 
WE GET TO LOOK BACK IN TIME THE FURTHEST WE GO 
BUT WE GET TO A POINT WHERE THE UNIVERSE WAS OPAQUE 
SO WE CAN'T SEE EARLIER THAN ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS 
CAN OUR TIMESCALES BE COMPLETELY WRONG 
POSSIBLE ANYTHING IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE 
BUT BEING THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS FITS WITH LOTS OF OTHER OBSERVATIONS 
WE KNOW IT WAS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND KELVIN THEN 
WE KNOW IT'S THREE KELVIN NOW 
SO WE KNOW SPACE HAS EXPANDED ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TIMES SINCE 
IF WE THINK WE KNOW THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE IT LIMITS WHAT TIME THE RADIATION WAS GIVEN OFF 
WE'RE TALKING OF SPACE EXPANDING 
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE EVIDENCE FOR IT 
GERRY WHY DO WE THINK SPACE IS EXPANDING AT ALL 
NOW IT'S JUST THE GOOD OLD HUBBLE RIDGE SHIFT 
NOW WE LOOK AWAY AND SEE EVERYTHING IS EXPANDING IN EVERY DIRECTION AS WE LOOK AWAY FROM US 
THAT'S A REALLY WELL ESTABLISHED PHENOMENON EXPANDING INTO WHAT 
THAT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION 
THERE'S ONE OTHER FUNDAMENTAL OBSSERVATION OF THE UNIVERSE 
IT'S SO FUNDAMENTAL WE ALL FORGET ABOUT IT 
THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT TIME IS ONLY GOING IN ONE DIRECTION 
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED PATRICK BUT YOU'RE GETTING OLDER I NOTICED IT 
IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION WHY DOES TIME ONLY GO IN ONE DIRECTION 
IT'S SHOULDN'T HAPPEN LIKE THAT TIME IS SUPPOSED TO BE SYMMETRIC 
BUT THE FACT THAT TIME ONLY GOES IN ONE DIRECTION 
IS FUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE UNIVERSE 
THAT TELLS US THAT THE PAST IS NOT THE SAME AS THE FUTURE 
THIS EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE ACTUALLY IS SEGREGATING UP HISTORY 
WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE FUTURE 
THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME FUNDAMENTAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN 
WHY TIME DOES THAT AND WHAT THE UNIVERSE IS REALLY MADE OF 
HOW DID THE BIG BANG HAPPEN YES WE'VE CONCEDED THAT ONE TO YOU 
I KNOW BUT I'M BEING DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HERE 
IS THERE SOMETHING STOPPING US FINDING OUT 
THAT IS A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION PATRICK IT RAISES TWO ISSUES 
THE FIRST IS DO WE HAVE A REAL SENSE OF WHAT THE UNIVERSE IS MADE OF 
THE ANSWER IS CHANGING VERY FAST 
IN FACT I REMEMBER ANSWERING THIS QUESTION TO YOU TEN YEARS AGO 
AND GIVING YOU A VERY DIFFERENT ANSWER I REMEMBER YES 
AS WELL AS THIS QUESTION THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF DARK MATTER AND DARK ENERGY WHICH WE'LL COME TO LATER 
IT ALSO RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE UNIVERSE IS SIMPLE ENOUGH FOR US TO UNDERSTAND 
AND WHETHER OR NOT THE BIT OF IT WE LIVE IN IS ACTUALLY A FAIR SAMPLE OF WHAT'S REALLY OUT THERE 
OR WHETHER THERE IS STUFF WHICH IS 
IF THAT IS THE CASE THAT IS THE LIMITS OF SCIENCE 
WE SIMPLY CAN'T DO SCIENCE AS WE DEFINE SCIENCE TODAY ON THINGS THAT WE CAN NEVER KNOW 
OF COURSE WE'RE ALL OPTIMISTS AS WELL AS BEING LITTLE DEVILS 
AND SO WE PROCEED TO TRY AND DO THE BEST WE CAN WITH THE LIMITS WE HAVE 
FRANKLY THAT RAISES ENOUGH INTELLECTUAL CHALLENGES 
WITHOUT WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT BEYOND THE HORIZON 
WE SEE THE AFFECTS OF DARK MATTER THEY HAVE GRAVITATIONAL AFFECTS 
WHAT IS DARK MATTER IS IT SOMETHING WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND 
WHAT A FUDGE ISN'T IT 
WE CAN SEE THE STARS IN THE GALAXY AND SEE THEM ROTATING IN THE GALAXY 
IF WE ADD UP ALL THAT MASS 
IT TURNS OUT THOSE GALAXIES SHOULD BE FALLING APART 
THE GALAXY ROTATION CURVES WE CALL THEM 
THE STARS ARE MOVING A BIT TOO FAST FOR THE MATTER THAT WE SEE INSIDE THE GALAXY 
SO WE'VE HAD TO INVOKE THIS DARK MATTER 
YOU CAN CALL IT A FUDGE BUT IT TURNS OUT IT'S INCREDIBLY CONSISTENT WITH ALL OUR OBSERVATIONS 
HAVING THIS SIMPLE TRANSPARENT PARTICLE THAT WEAKLY INTERACTS 
BUT HAS A MASS JUST DOESN'T INTERACT WITH LIGHT 
HAVING THEM IN GALAXIES WORKS VERY WELL WITH OTHER OBSERVATIONS 
BECAUSE WE NEED THEM IN GALAXY CLUSTERS AND THE EARLY UNIVERSE 
WE NEED DARK MATTER IN EVERYTHING WE LOOK AT 
HOW MUCH OF IT IS THERE A LOT THERE IS A LOT YOU'RE RIGHT 
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE UNIVERSE WE ESSENTIALLY SEE A SIZE ZERO UNIVERSE 
BUT WHEN WE WEIGH IT WE SEE A SIZE SIX UNIVERSE 
THERE REALLY IS FIVE OR SIX TIMES MORE WEIGHT IN THE UNIVERSE THAN THERE IS LIGHT 
BUT IT'S NOT SHINING THIS STUFF SO IT'S CALLED DARK MATTER 
IT'S ACTUALLY TRANSPARENT MATTER 
WE'RE LUCKY IT ISN'T DARK IF IT WAS IT WOULD BLOCK OUR VIEW 
AND WE COULDN'T SEE FAR OR DO VERY INTERESTING ASTRONOMY 
FORTUNATELY IT'S NOT DARK IT'S TRANSPARENT 
THAT SIMPLE STATEMENT TELLS US IT'S NOT MADE OF THE SAME STUFF YOU AND I ARE MADE OF 
THE STUFF WE ARE MADE OF HYDROGEN HELIUM AND SO ON KNOWS ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETISM GOOD OLD MAXWELL 
SO IT INTERACTS WITH LIGHT IT CREATES LIGHT AND ABSORBS LIGHT AND INTERACTS WITH LIGHT AND SO WE SHINE 
THAT'S WHY WE SHINE WE'RE MADE OF ELECTRICITY 
WHEREAS MOST OF THE UNIVERSE ISN'T MOST OF THE UNIVERSE KNOWS ABOUT NEWTON AND EINSTEIN AND GRAVITY 
BUT IT DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MAXWELL 
ARE THERE OTHER WAYS TO EXPLAIN THESE PHENOMENA 
WITHOUT INTERFACING SOMETHING WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND CAN'T SEE AND CAN ONLY POSTULATE 
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE TO GET RID OF DARK MATTER THERE IS ANOTHER IDEA 
THE ONLY WAY WE KNOW DARK MATTER IS THERE IS BY ITS GRAVITY 
WE SEE IT BENDING LIGHT UNDER GRAVITATIONAL LENSING EVENTS 
WE SEE IT HELPING THE ORBITS OF THE STARS IN THE GALAXY 
BUT WHAT IF PERHAPS OUR THEORIES OF GRAVITY ARE WRONG 
SO WE'VE INVENTED DARK MATTER JUST BY ITS GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION 
EXACTLY GOOD POINT 
IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE HAD NEWTON AND HIS THEORY OF HOW GRAVITY WORKED 
AND IT WORKED WELL FOR THE EARTH QUITE WELL FOR THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
BUT NOT PERFECTLY DID IT 
NO MERCURY WAS WRONG GOOD ENOUGH 
THEN A COUPLE OF CENTURIES LATER EINSTEIN CAME ALONG AND WORKED OUT THAT ACTUALLY 
ON BIGGER SCALES IT DOES NEED TO BE MODIFIED 
HE TWEAKED NEWTON'S MODEL AND CAME UP WITH GENERAL RELATIVITY 
WHAT'S TO SAY IN ANOTHER CENTURY WE'LL HAVE TO TWEAK IT AGAIN 
EXTRAPILATION FROM A LAW OF GRAVITY THAT WORKS ON THE EARTH TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
TO GALAXIES AND THE WHOLE OF THE UNIVERSE 
I THINK IT WOULD BE NAIVE TO THINK YOU COULD APPLY LAWS SO FAR TO THE WHOLE UNIVERSE 
WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER OPTION 
MODIFYING GRAVITY TURNS OUT HARD ESPECIALLY GETTING IT TO FIT WITH THESE OBSERVATIONS 
SO LET'S DO WHAT ASTRONOMERS DO AND BLAME THE PARTICLE PHYSICISTS 
IS THERE HOPE THEY MAY PROVIDE A SET OF WEAKLY INTERACTING PARTICLES WE CAN USE FOR OUR DARK MATTER 
WE NOW REALISE THERE ARE LOTS WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE UNIVERSE AND THE NATURE OF MATTER 
WHY IS THE UNIVERSE MADE OF MATTER AND NO ANTI MATTER IT SHOULDN'T 
IT SHOULD BE PERFECT BUT THERE'S MORE ORDINARY MATTER THAN ANTI MATTER AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY 
IN FACT THERE'S ABOUT THIRTEEN OF THESE LITTLE PROBLEMS YOU CAN THINK OF 
HISTORICALLY EVERY TIME YOU GET A PROBLEM LIKE THAT 
WHICH LED TO THE EXPLANATION OF A NEW TYPE OF PARTICLE 
FOR ELECTROMAGNETISM WE HAVE PHOTONS LIGHT 
AND ALL THE OTHER FORCES HAVE THEIR OWN PARTICLES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM 
WE KNOW THAT THERE MUST BE A LOT MORE TYPES OF PARTICLES 
THE MOST POPULARLY DISCUSSED THESE DAYS IS PETER HIGGS' EXPOSON THAT WE HOPEFULLY WILL SEE AND HEAR SOON 
FOR VARIOUS PHENOMENA WE INVENT PARTICLES PARTICLES AND STILL MORE PARTICLES 
NONE YOU CAN SEE NONE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND 
EVEN SO WITH ALL THAT IT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN ALL THE MASS 
YES HERE WE ENTER THE REALM OF DARK ENERGY EXACTLY 
DARK ENERGY IS A LABEL YOU'RE PRECISELY RIGHT PATRICK WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT IT IS NO 
IT SHOULDN'T EXIST THERE SHOULDN'T BE THE AMOUNT OF IT THERE APPEARS TO BE EVERYTHING THERE IS WRONG 
THAT TELLS US THAT NATURE IS CLEVERER THAN ASTONOMERS ARE NATURE KEEPS SURPRISING US IT'S EXCITING 
BUT AS FAR AS DARK ENERGY IS CONCERNED THE OBSERVATION IS SIMPLE 
THE UNIVERSE SHOULD BE SLOWING DOWN 
THERE WAS A BIG BANG AS WE DISCUSSED AND THERE IS WEIGHT IN THE UNIVERSE 
YOU AND ME AND WE ARE PULLING AGAINST THE UNIVERSE 
WE'RE SLOWING IT DOWN THE SAME AS A ROCKET GOING OFF INTO SPACE 
SO THE WHOLE THING SHOULD BE SLOWING DOWN IN FACT THE UNIVERSE IS NOT SLOWING DOWN IT'S ACCELERATING 
IT SEEMS TO BE ACCELERATING IN A PERFECTLY UNIFORM WAY EXPANDING FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER 
WHY THAT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION 
WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE IS SOME PROPERTY OF SPACE TIME ITSELF 
JUST EMPTY SPACE TIME NOTHING TO DO WITH ITS CONTENTS OR MATTER 
BUT SPACE TIME ITSELF SEEMS AS ITS VERY NATURE TO WANT TO EXPAND AND MAKE ITSELF MORE OF A VACCUUM 
ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE A NEW CONCEPT WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND AND CAN'T SEE 
AND WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE ENERGY IN THE UNIVERSE 
IT FITS THE OBSERVATIONS BUT COMES FROM TWO OBSERVATIONS DOESN'T IT 
ONE IS THAT THE UNIVERSE EXPANSION IS ACCELERATING 
BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE DON'T SEE ENOUGH MASS TO MAKE UP THE WHOLE COSMIC PIE 
ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF STUFF 
THAT'S IN THE UNIVERSE IS THAT WE CAN WEIGH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ENERGY 
WE CAN COUNT WHATEVER ELSE THERE IS AS WELL 
AND WE DO THAT IN AN INCREDIBLY SIMPLE WAY 
IT'S JUST BASIC SCHOOL GEOMETRY 
WHEN I DRAW A TRIANGLE ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF ME 
I KNOW THAT THE ANGLES OF THAT TRIANGLE WILL ADD UP TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
THAT'S STUFF EUCLID DISCOVERED LONG AGO AND WE KNOW IS CORRECT 
IF I DO THE SAME THING ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IT'S CURVED 
SO THE ANGLES OF THAT TRIANGLE WILL ADD UP TO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
AND SO BY MEASURING QUITE SIMPLY THE ANGLES IN A TRIANGLE 
I CAN TELL WHETHER THE SURFACE I'M ON IS CURVED OR FLAT 
THE NUMBER COULD BE LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES IF WE WERE SHAPED LIKE A SADDLE 
SO I CAN MEASURE THOSE ANGLES FROM THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND 
I CAN MEASURE THE ANGLES OF THE UNIVERSE AND TELL VERY ACCURATELY 
WHAT SHAPE IS SPACE TIME ITSELF 
AND THAT CORRESPONDS TO HOW MUCH STUFF THERE IS IN THE UNIVERSE 
AND SO WE KNOW ACCURATELY FROM BASIC GEOMETRY MEASURING ANGLES 
THAT THE UNIVERSE CONTAINS JUST UNDER SIX HYDROGEN ATOMS PER CUBIC METRE 
THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT WEIGHT WHAT IS IT MADE OF 
ALL OUR ORDINARY MATTER AND OUR DARK MATTER ONLY MAKES UP A QUARTER OF IT 
AGAIN WE'VE WEIGHED THE UNIVERSE AND WE'VE SAID 
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL AS ORDINARY WEIGHT THERE 
WE HAVE THESE HORRIBLE FUDGES WE'VE HAD TO PUT IN 
FITTING INDEPENDENT OBSERVATIONS 
SOME PEOPLE THINK WE MAKE THIS UP AS WE GO ALONG BUT WHILE IT'S CONSISTENT 
IT'S HARD TO FIND OUT MUCH ABOUT IT 
CAN WE GET RID OF IT 
WELL ACTUALLY OUR PATCH EVERYTHING WE CAN SEE IS A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THE UNIVERSE 
THERE MIGHT BE A LOT MORE BEYOND WHAT WE SEE BUT WE LIKE TO THINK THAT OUR PATCH IS A GOOD AVERAGE 
THAT ASSUMPTION ALLOWS US TO APPLY GENERAL AUTIVITY 
AND WE CAN INFER DARK ENERGY 
BUT WHAT IF OUR PATCH WAS QUITE ODD AND NOT REPRESENTATIVE EXACTLY 
MAYBE JUST LOCALLY WE HAVE AN ACCELERATION AND THE WHOLE UNIVERSE DOESN'T HAVE DARK ENERGY IN IT 
THAT MUST BE THE TENTH ASSUMPTION SO FAR 
LOOKING FURTHER AHEAD YOU SAY IT BEGAN WITH THE BIG BANG I WONDER 
HOW'S IT GOING TO END WILL IT END WITH A BIG CRUNCH A BIG SQUASH 
WE REALISE WE ASSERT THAT THE UNIVERSE IS GOING TO LIVE 
FOR EVER SO THE UNIVERSE HAD A BEGINNING BUT IT HAS NO END 
IT'S SPEEDING UP AFTER ALL 
IT WILL ACCELERATE INTO NOTHINGNESS 
THAT IS BIZARRE IN THE EXTREME 
EVEN THOSE OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO LIKE MOST COSMOLOGISTS 
ARE ALWAYS CONFIDENT BUT OFTEN WRONG FIND THAT PUZZLING 
WHY IS IT WE END UP SAYING THEN THAT WE ARE ALIVE NOW 
AT THE ONLY INSTANT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE 
WHEN WE COULD ACTUALLY DO ASTRONOMY 
BECAUSE ALMOST THE ENTIRE FUTURE OF THE UNIVERSE 
IT WILL BE SO DILUTE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE ANY STARS 
JUST A FEW LITTLE ATOMS ON THEIR OWN YET HERE WE ARE 
THAT MAKES US SO UNLIKELY PEOPLE REACT IN TWO WAYS QUITE 
THAT'S THE WAY NATURE IS WE WON THE LOTTERY TICKET 
YOU CAN'T WIN WITHOUT A LOT OF LOSING TICKETS SO ALL THE OTHER UNIVERSES 
ARE EMPTY AND THAT'S THE MOST COMMON WAY COSMOLOGISTS REACT TO THAT 
EVERYBODY ELSE SAYS THAT IS SO ABSURD THERE'S A BIG PIECE OF THE JIGSAW WE HAVEN'T SPOTTED YET 
I JUST WONDER 
SOME UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS HIDDEN FROM US 
THAT COULD UNDERMINE THESE THEORIES 
CAN WE BE COMPLETELY WRONG NOW 
IF SO CAN WE FIND OUT 
OR ARE WE BEING STOPPED FROM FINDING OUT SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX 
ALL WE CAN DO IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IS MAKE AS MANY OBSERVATIONS AS WE CAN 
THE LARGEST ONE WE CAN MAKE IS THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND 
SO WHAT DO WE LEARN FROM LOOKING AT THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND 
WHAT DOES IT TELL US ABOUT THE EARLIEST UNIVERSE 
IT TELLS US ABOUT THE PERIOD BEFORE 
WE SAID THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS 
BUT WE THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THE FIRST TEN TO THE MINUS THIRTY THREE SECONDS 
THAT HAS LEFT IMPRINTS ON THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND 
IT'S OUR BEST PROBE OF THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE 
BUT ALSO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF OUR PATCH IS WEIRD 
IT'S A GOOD THING TO USE FOR THAT 
WE FIND THAT COSMIC BACKGROUND MICROWAVE RADIATION IS VERY SMOOTH 
TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE PART IN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IT IS COMPLETELY SMOOTH 
FROM ONE PART OF THE SKY TO THE OTHER SMOOTHER THAN A WHITE PIECE OF PAPER 
THAT CONSTRAINS THE IDEA THAT WE'RE IN AN ODD PIECE OF THE UNIVERSE 
WHEN THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND WAS FIRST DETECTED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES IT WAS VERY VERY SMOOTH 
BUT SINCE THEN IN THE EIGHTIES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE FLUCTUATIONS 
IF THERE WEREN'T ANY FLUCTUATIONS WE WOULDN'T BE HERE 
THOSE ARE THE SEEDS OVER DENSE AND UNDER DENSE PATCHES 
OVER TIME GRAVITY HAS SLOWLY CAUSED THEM TO COLLAPSE AND WE GET THE STRUCTURE AROUND US 
THERE ARE THREE PROBLEMS LEFT 
AND ONE SOLUTION SOLVES ALL THREE BUT IT'S NOT A NICE SOLUTION 
THE PROBLEMS ARE AS KATE SAID THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND TELLS US 
THE EARLY UNIVERSE WAS VERY SMOOTH 
WHY WE KNOW THE UNIVERSE AS JERRY SAID IS FLAT 
YES WHY SHOULD WE BE THERE 
YOU NEED THESE SMALL FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND 
TO PRODUCE GALAXIES SO THERE CAN BE ASTRONOMERS AND THE SKY AT NIGHT 
WHY WERE THEY THERE AT ALL HOW DO WE RESOLVE THESE THREE PROBLEMS 
WELL WE KIND OF CONSOLIDATE THESE THREE DEBTS INTO ONE IN SOME WAYS 
BY HAVING WHAT WE CALL INFLATION 
WE THINK IT'S A VERY SIMPLE IDEA BUT WE THINK 
THAT THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE AND WE EVEN SAY BEFORE THE BIG BANG 
THAT'S HOW WE TEND TO TALK ABOUT IT 
IN THE FIRST TEN TO THE MINUS THIRTY FOUR SECONDS THERE WAS A RAPID EXPANSION 
SPACE EXPANDED FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT WHY 
IT EXPLAINS ALL THESE PROBLEMS HOW 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED EXACTLY 
IT'S LIKE SHIFTING THREE DEBTS INTO ONE EXACTLY 
IT EXPLAINS ALL THREE THINGS 
IT MAKES YOUR LITTLE PATCH OF THE UNIVERSE EXPAND VERY QUICKLY 
LIKE IF YOU WERE STANDING ON A FOOTBALL YOU'D SEE IT WAS ROUND 
IF IT RAPIDLY EXPANDED YOU COULD VERY THINK IT WAS FLAT 
AND NO MEASUREMENT YOU COULD MAKE COULD TELL YOU OTHERWISE 
WITH A PERIOD OF RAPID EXPANSION THE UNIVERSE WOULD ALWAYS LOOK FLAT 
IT ALSO MAKES EVERYTHING VERY SMOOTH SO WITHOUT INFLATION 
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ONE SIDE OF THE SKY IS THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS THE OTHER 
THEY SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMMUNICATE RADIATION AND HEAT 
IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE REACHED EQUILIBRIUM BUT THEY'RE THE EXACT SAME TEMPERATURE 
AND INFLATION DOES THE SAME THING 
YOU HAVE A SMALL PATCH WHERE RADIATION WAS ABLE TO TRANSFER 
THESE PARTS WHICH WERE IN CAUSAL CONTACT THEY COULD TALK TO EACH OTHER YES 
THEY WERE PUSHED APART BUT THE AMAZING THING ABOUT INFLATION 
IS IT MAKES THE UNIVERSE SMOOTH BUT IT ALSO GIVES IT THESE LITTLE FLUCTUATIONS 
QUANTUM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VACUUM WERE EXPANDED RAPIDLY 
THEY WENT FROM SCALES WE CAN'T EVEN SEE TO CLASSICAL SCALES WHICH ARE RELEVANT TO YOU AND I 
THE SEEDS WHICH FORM THE GALAXIES AFTER INFLATION 
BEFORE WERE SCALES SMALLER THAN AN ATOMIC NUCLEUS 
IT'S A WHACKY IDEA BUT IT WORKS IT WORKS VERY NICELY 
BUT AS YOU SAY IT IS AN IDEA 
BUT SPACE EXPANDING FASTER THAN LIGHT I FIND THAT VERY HARD TO SAY 
IT GOES AGAINST THE FUNDAMENTAL THING IN GENERAL AUTIVITY 
NOTHING CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT BUT NOTHING CAN TRAVEL THROUGH SPACE FASTER 
SPACE ITSELF CAN PRETTY MUCH DO WHAT IT LIKES 
IT DOESN'T BREAK ANY OF OUR LAWS AT THE MOMENT 
TO HAVE SPACE RAPIDLY EXPANDING 
THERE ARE GALAXIES THAT LOOK AS IF THEY ARE MOVING FASTER 
HAVE WE FOUND ANY PROBLEMS 
IT'S CONSISTENT WITH OBSERVATIONS OF THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND 
THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND HAS HOT AND COLD SPOTS 
ON THE LARGEST SCALE THESE PATTERNS SHOULD BE QUITE RANDOM 
IF YOU BLUR THESE SMALL PATTERNS INTO LARGER PIXELS 
YOU SEE NO PATTERN AT ALL 
THEY SHOULD BE QUITE RANDOM AND WHAT WE SEE AT THE MOMENT 
WHEN YOU BLUR IT INTO BIG PIXELS YOU SEEM TO GET THIS PATTERN 
THE HOT AND COLD SPOTS ALL ALIGNING 
AND THEY SEEM TO BE MARKING OUT A DIRECTION THE AXIS OF EVIL 
THIS AXIS OF EVIL IN THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND WHICH INFLATION 
PREDICTS SHOULDN'T BE THERE INFLATION BECAUSE OF RAPID EXPANSION 
REALLY AVERAGES EVERYTHING OUT AND THE UNIVERSE SHOULDN'T HAVE A LEFT OR A RIGHT 
I'M BOUND TO BE RATHER WARY ABOUT THE AXIS OF EVIL WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT GERRY 
GIVEN YOUR CURRENT MOOD I'D THINK YOU'D RUB YOUR HANDS IN GLEE 
I DID RATHER SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX I DID 
THERE'S TWO INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE AXIS OF EVIL ACTUALLY 
ONE POINT KATE ALREADY PICKED UP IS IT REAL 
AND ONLY FUTURE MEASUREMENTS WILL CONFIRM THAT YES OR NO 
IT'S RIGHT AT THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE CAN MEASURE 
FORTUNATELY THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY IS LAUNCHING A NEW SATELLITE 
SO WE'LL KNOW WHETHER IT'S REAL SOON 
THE SECOND THING IS IT IS THIS TEST OF WHETHER OR NOT 
WHAT WE CAN SEE IS REALLY A FAIR TEST OF WHAT'S REALLY OUT THERE 
AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT UNLUCKY 
OUR UNIVERSE IS NEARLY PERFECT PERFECT ENOUGH THAT WE'RE HERE 
BUT PERHAPS IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT DEFECTIVE AND THIS WOULD BE A HINT 
THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NOT QUITE AS PERFECT AS OUR SIMPLE EXPLANATIONS 
WOULD HAVE IT 
IT WOULD BE HINTING THAT THERE ARE EVEN MORE COMPLEX EXPLANATIONS 
GOING TO BE REQUIRED THAN THOSE WE'VE BEEN SPECULATING ABOUT TODAY 
WELL WE'VE GOT SOMEWHERE 
IF SOMEONE COULD LOOK BACK ON THIS OUR PROGRAMME SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX 
IN A COUPLE OF ONE HUNDRED YEARS TIME 
WOULD THEY SAY ALL THIS IS COMPLETELY OBSOLETE NOW 
I'M SURE THEY WILL 
I BET IF YOU LOOK BACK ON PROGRAMME SIXTY SIX YOU'D SAY THE SAME NOW 
I DO 
I REMEMBER I DID ONE PROGRAMME ABOUT VENUS 
I MADE SIX STATEMENTS ABOUT VENUS ALL BACKED UP BY THE BEST EVIDENCE 
AND EVERY ONE OF WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG 
WELL A NICE HISTORICAL ANALOGY WITH THIS IS THE FAMOUS STATE OF PHYSICS IN NINETEEN HUNDRED 
MANY PEOPLE SUMMARISED THE STATE OF SCIENCE AT THE TIME 
FAMOUSLY LORD KELVIN SAID YES 
WE SOON WILL KNOW EVERYTHING WE NEED TO KNOW BUT THERE IS THIS LITTLE CLOUD ON THE HORIZON 
HE WAS REFERRING TO WHAT WE CALL A COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT 
ZERO POINT ENERGY 
BUT THAT CLOUD CLEARED AWAY IT BECAME TRANSPARENT 
AND IT LEFT BEHIND PLANK AND RUTHERFORD AND EINSTEIN 
SO THAT TINY LITTLE UNCERTAINTY IN PHYSICS 
CREATED ATOMS IN NINETEEN HUNDRED THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ATOMS AND RELATIVITY 
IT TOOK THAT NEW SCIENCE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND SPECIAL AND GENERAL RELATIVITY 
TO SEE WHAT WAS BEHIND THAT CLOUD 
NOW WE HAVE TWO OR THREE LITTLE CLOUDS ON THE HORIZON 
THERE'S NO REASON TO ASSUME WHAT'S BEHIND THEM ISN'T AS CHALLENGING 
AND IMAGINATIVE AS WHAT WAS BEHIND OUR ONE LITTLE CLOUD 
DO YOU AGREE 
OUR HORIZONS PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY HAVE EXPANDED A FEW TIMES IN THE LAST TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
WE USED TO THINK THE EARTH WAS AT THE CENTRE AND THEN WE REALISED 
AFTER A LONG TIME THAT ACTUALLY THE SUN WAS CENTRE 
THEN WE REALISED THE OTHER STARS WERE JUST LIKE OUR SUN YES 
IT'S ONLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THAT WE REALISED THERE WERE OTHER GALAXIES I'M SURE THEY'LL EXPAND AGAIN 
IT'S ONLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THAT WE REALISED THERE WERE OTHER GALAXIES I'M SURE THEY'LL EXPAND AGAIN 
CHRIS I'M AN OPTIMIST SO I THINK WE'LL MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS 
I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL GET A GOOD HANDLE ON DARK MATTER SOON 
I THINK THE PARTICLE PHYSICISTS WILL FIND SOME CANDIDATES 
DARK ENERGY WE HAVE NO THEORETICAL UNDERLYING REASON FOR THIS ACCELERATION 
IT'S HARD TO THINK OF OBSERVATIONS THAT WOULD REALLY HELP THAT'S A MUCH HARDER PROBLEM 
WE WILL GET THERE EVENTUALLY IT'S A MORE RECENT ONE AS WELL 
LET'S GIVE OURSELVES A BREAK THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT COMPLETELY 
THE WHOLE OF SCIENCE IS BASED ON THE TRULY ASTONISHING EXPERIMENT WHICH WE REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND 
THE FUNDAMENTAL THING WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT OUR BRAINS CAN UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSE 
PERHAPS THERE'S A LIMIT I DON'T KNOW QUITE 
WE'VE COME TO VARIOUS BRICK WALLS AND WE'VE SURMOUNTED THEM AND WE'VE GOT SEVERAL NOW 
THAT WE CAN'T SEE OVER OR IF THERE IS AN OVER 
AND THAT MAY BE HIDDEN FROM US 
ARE WE EVER GOING TO SOLVE THESE THINGS OR IS SOMETHING LIKE SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX 
GOING TO STOP US DOING SO 
WE JUST DON'T KNOW 
KATE JERRY CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AND NEXT MONTH THE PLANET SATURN AND THE CASSINI PROBE 
UNTIL THEN FROM ALL OF US GOOD NIGHT
