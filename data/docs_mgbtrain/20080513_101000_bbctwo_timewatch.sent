ON SEPTEMBER THE ELEVENTH NINETEEN FORTY THREE A SMALL TEAM OF MEN SET OUT ON WHAT OFFICIAL RECORDS DESCRIBED 
AS THE MOST DARING ATTACK OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
THE SECRET MISSION PITTED JUST A HANDFUL OF BRITISH VOLUNTEERS 
AGAINST AN ENEMY SEVERAL THOUSAND STRONG 
I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT WE WERE IN FOR 
CRAMMED INTO FOUR MAN MIDGET SUBMARINES 
THEY BATTLED FOR ELEVEN DAYS ACROSS TREACHEROUS ARCTIC SEAS 
THEIR OBJECTIVE 
AN IMPREGNABLE NORWEGIAN FJORD AND A FOE ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TIMES THEIR SIZE 
THE BATTLESHIP HITLER CALLED THE BEAST TIRPITZ 
GERMANY'S BIGGEST SHIP TIRPITZ WAS A CONSTANT MENACE TO ALLIED CONVOYS 
CHURCHILL DECLARED THAT THE WHOLE STRATEGY OF THE WAR TURNS AT THIS PERIOD ON THIS SHIP 
HIDDEN AWAY IN HER LAIR HER CREW BELIEVED TIRPITZ UNTOUCHABLE 
BUT THE BEAST WOULD BE SLAIN BY THREE EXPERIMENTAL X. CRAFT 
HERE WE HAVE THREE GADGETS IF YOU LIKE ATTACKING THE BIGGEST SHIP IN THE GERMAN NAVY 
YOU CAN'T GET MUCH MORE DRAMATIC THAN THAT 
FROM THE OUTSET THE ODDS WERE STACKED AGAINST THE VOLUNTEERS 
HE KNEW HE WASN'T COMING BACK 
HE DID 
REMARKABLY CREW MEMBERS FROM TWO OF THE MIDGET SUBMARINES SURVIVED TO TELL THE TALE 
BUT MYSTERY HAS ALWAYS SURROUNDED THE ROLE PLAYED IN THE ATTACK 
BY THE REMAINING SUBMARINE X. FIVE AND HER FOUR MAN CREW 
TONIGHT TIMEWATCH JOINS A TEAM OF DIVERS AS THEY SEEK TO RESOLVE THE MYSTERY 
AND REVEALS THE FULL STORY OF THE HEROES OF THE TIRPITZ RAID 
KAAFJORD IN NORTHERN NORWAY THREE HUNDRED MILES INSIDE THE ARCTIC CIRCLE 
A TEAM OF NORWEGIAN DIVERS ARRIVE IN SEARCH OF THE WRECK OF A BRITISH MIDGET SUBMARINE 
SUNK HERE DURING A HEROIC RAID ON THE GERMAN BATTLESHIP TIRPITZ 
BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY ALL THREE 
ON BOARD IS STUART USHER A HISTORICAL RESEARCHER WHO HAS SPENT THIRTY YEARS ON A QUEST 
TO LOCATE THE MISSING MIDGET SUBMARINE X. FIVE 
HERE WE ARE AND ON THE STARBOARD SIDE YOU SHOULD SEE SOME OBJECTS TOO O. K. 
AFTER YEARS OF DIVING IN THE FJORD THEY'RE CONVINCED THEY KNOW WHERE THE WRECK OF X. FIVE IS THERE SHE IS 
OH YES THEIR SONAR EQUIPMENT HAS PICKED UP AN UNUSUALLY SHAPED OBJECT ON THE FJORD BED 
AND IT APPEARS TO BE NEAR TO WHERE EYEWITNESSES SAY THEY LAST SAW X. FIVE 
TO FIND OUT MORE THEY SEND DOWN AN UNDERWATER CAMERA 
THE WRECKAGE IS IN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FEET OF WATER 
THE PROBLEM IS THIS FJORD WAS ONCE A MAJOR GERMAN NAVAL BASE 
AND THE BOTTOM IS LITTERED WITH WRECKS 
IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE AGAINST ALL ODDS 
THREE TINY SUBMARINES CREPT IN HERE 
TO PLANT EXPLOSIVE CHARGES UNDER THE ENORMOUS BATTLESHIP TIRPITZ 
THE CAPTAINS OF TWO OF THE SUBMARINES WERE AWARDED THE VICTORIA CROSS 
AND THEIR CREWS DECORATED 
BUT THE THIRD SUBMARINE X. FIVE 
DISAPPEARED WITHOUT TRACE DURING THE ATTACK 
THE BIG MYSTERY OF THIS OPERATION IS 
DID ALL THREE X. CRAFT ACTUALLY ATTACK THE TIRPITZ 
WE KNOW X. SIX DID WE KNOW X. SEVEN DID BECAUSE THEIR SURVIVORS TOLD THE STORY OF HOW THEY DID IT 
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS DID THE LEAD SUBMARINE OF THE ATTACK 
X. FIVE ACTUALLY LAY A SIDE CHARGE OR BOTH OF THEM 
WE DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE THE CREW WERE KILLED THEY NEVER CAME BACK THEY DISAPPEARED 
AND WE AREN'T EVEN CERTAIN HOW THE SUBMARINE WAS SUNK ALL WE KNOW IS THAT IT WAS SPOTTED 
IT WAS ATTACKED AND THEN IT DISAPPEARS FROM SIGHT FOREVER 
TIRPITZ WAS HITLER'S PRIDE AND JOY AND GERMANY'S MOST POTENT NAVAL WEAPON 
THE BEAST WAS FIFTY THOUSAND TONS EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THREE FEET LONG 
WITH AN ARMAMENT OF EIGHT FIFTEEN INCH GUNS 
SHE WAS STATIONED IN KAAFJORD 
TO INTERCEPT THE BRITISH CONVOYS ON THEIR WAY TO MURMANSK IN RUSSIA 
IN JULY NINETEEN FORTY TWO TIRPITZ AND HER BATTLE GROUP 
BROUGHT ABOUT ONE OF THE GREATEST SHIPPING DISASTERS OF THE WAR 
ALLIED CONVOY P. Q. SEVENTEEN LIKE SO MANY OTHER CONVOYS WAS TORN APART 
OF THE THIRTY SIX SHIPS THAT SET OUT FOR RUSSIA TWENTY FOUR WERE SUNK 
U. BOATS AND AIRCRAFT DID THE SINKING BUT TIRPITZ WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INITIAL PANIC 
WINSTON CHURCHILL DECLARED HER AS HIS NUMBER ONE TARGET 
CHURCHILL WAS VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE THREAT POSED BY TIRPITZ 
HE'S CONSTANTLY HECKLING HIS COMMANDERS TO SAY WHY CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT TIRPITZ 
SHE'S THERE DO SOMETHING ABOUT HER BOMB HER ATTACK HER IN OTHER WAYS 
BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM 
TIRPITZ AND HER BATTLE GROUP WERE HIDDEN AWAY UNDER A HIGH WALLED FJORD IN NORTHERN NORWAY 
R. A. F. BOMBING MISSIONS HAD PROVED UNSUCCESSFUL 
THE FJORD WAS SO HEAVILY DEFENDED THAT ATTACK BY SURFACE SHIPS WAS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE 
TIRPITZ WAS EVEN PROTECTED BENEATH THE WAVES 
BECAUSE TIRPITZ IS SURROUNDED BY ANTI TORPEDO NETS 
YOU CANNOT USE CONVENTIONAL SUBMARINES AGAINST HER 
THE MAJOR WEAPON OF A CONVENTIONAL SUBMARINE IS THE TORPEDO 
AND IF YOU FIRE A TORPEDO AT TIRPITZ FROM OUTSIDE THE NETS ALL YOU'LL GET IS AN EXPLOSION ON THE NETS 
THEREFORE YOU HAD TO FIND SOMETHING THAT COULD GET UNDER THE NETS OR THROUGH THE NETS 
AND DROP EXPLOSIVE CHARGES BESIDE THE SHIP ITSELF 
AN EXPERIMENTAL WEAPON WAS BEING SECRETLY DEVELOPED 
IN AUGUST NINETEEN FORTY TWO NOTICES AT PORTSMOUTH NAVAL BASE CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS 
FOR SPECIAL AND HAZARDOUS DUTIES 
AMONG THE VOLUNTEERS WAS VERNON COLES 
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT THERE WERE LOTS OF RUMOURS FLYING AROUND 
THE SHED THAT THIS OBJECT WAS IN WHICH WAS 
WE STILL DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS 
AN ARMED SENTRY OUTSIDE GOT PERMISSION 
TO TAKE US INTO AN INNER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS ANOTHER SENTRY INSIDE 
THEY OPENED THE INNER DOOR AND WE WENT IN AND SAW THIS GHASTLY THING LAYING THERE 
WE LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND SAID GOOD HEAVENS IS THIS IT 
THE STOMACHS TURNED OVER 
I WAS RATHER FRIGHTENED 
IT LOOKED SO SMALL 
AND VERY VERY WET AND SMELLY INSIDE 
WHAT LAY INSIDE THE SHED WAS THE X. CRAFT 
A REVOLUTIONARY MIDGET SUBMARINE POWERED BY A LONDON BUS ENGINE 
INITIALLY KNOWN SIMPLY AS JOB EIGHTY TWO 
THE PROTOTYPE WAS SO TOP SECRET 
THAT IT WAS BUILT IN THREE SEPARATE SECTIONS IN DIFFERENT SHIPYARDS 
BEFORE BEING ASSEMBLED IN PORTSMOUTH 
EACH X. CRAFT WOULD CARRY A DIVER 
WHO COULD LEAD THE SUBMARINE TO CUT THROUGH THE UNDERWATER STEEL NETS THAT SURROUNDED TIRPITZ 
THEY WOULD ALSO CARRY A NEW WEAPON 
TWO ENORMOUS BOMBS CALLED SADDLE CHARGES WHICH WERE TO BE DROPPED 
UNDERNEATH THE HULL OF THE BATTLESHIP AT HER BASE IN NORWAY 
INSIDE THE MIDGET SUBMARINE THERE WAS ROOM FOR JUST FOUR MEN 
OH IT WAS CERTAINLY TINY 
THEY SAY THEY ARE FIFTY FOOT ER FIFTY FOOT LONG 
THEY'RE NOT FIFTY FOOT LONG INSIDE NOT BY ANY MEANS 
I WAS ACTUALLY SIX FOOT ONE 
BUT THERE WAS A CHAP IN X. EIGHT HE WAS SIX FOOT TWO 
AND THE FIRST LIEUTENANT OF X. SEVEN BILL WHITTAM HE WAS SIX FOOT FOUR 
I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT WE WERE IN FOR 
BUT WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND FOOLISH YOU WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
SIXTY ONE YEARS AFTER THE X. CRAFT MADE THEIR WAY INTO THIS FJORD THE NORWEGIAN DIVERS BELIEVE 
THEY ARE CLOSE TO FINDING THE WRECK OF THE MISSING X. FIVE 
WE ARE ALMOST EXACTLY OVER WHERE X. FIVE WAS LAST SEEN 
AND FIRED UPON BY TIRPITZ 
WHO OF COURSE WAS IMMEDIATELY BEHIND US 
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED METRES AWAY IN THAT DIRECTION 
X. FIVE SEEN AT OH SEVEN OH DEGREES ON ST TIRPITZ'S STARBOARD BOW 
AND THAT PUTS US RIGHT HERE WE'RE RIGHT OVER IT NOW 
SO THE WRECK OF X. FIVE SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE BOAT AS WE STAND AT THE MOMENT 
AND THEN OUT OF THE GLOOM OF THE FJORD A WRECK THE NORWEGIAN DIVERS BELIEVE COULD BE X. FIVE 
YES THAT'S AN INTERESTING FEATURE JOHN ISN'T IT 
COS THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THAT IS THE BOW YES THERE'S NO DENYING IT 
WHICH WE THINK CAME FROM TIRPITZ WHILE SHE WAS UNDERGOING REPAIR A LITTLE BIT DOWN PLEASE 
YOU CAN SEE HOW CRUSHED IT IS YES YES 
YES IT'S IN REAL BAD SHAPE ISN'T IT 
THEY SUFFERED SOME EXPLOSIVE FORCE DIDN'T THEY 
ALTHOUGH THE DAMAGE TO THE WRECK IS CONSISTENT WITH REPORTS OF X. FIVE BEING DEPTH CHARGED 
SO FAR STUART USHER HAS NOT SEEN ANY FEATURES THAT CAN POSITIVELY IDENTIFY THE WRECK 
THAT THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO SEE THIS HATCH HERE AND WE'RE COMING TO IT NOW AREN'T WE 
THE DIVERS THINK THAT THIS ACCESS HATCH IS SIMILAR TO AN X. CRAFT'S 
BUT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR STUART TO BE CERTAIN IT IS THE RIGHT SHAPE 
NOT ALTOGETHER HAPPY WITH THE HATCH 
WHERE ARE THOSE VERY LARGE DOMED CAST IRON HATCHES 
IT IT'S A WORRY TO ME ER THAT WE CAN'T SEE THOSE TWO HATCHES 
EVERY X. CRAFT HAD THEM BECAUSE THAT'S THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF HOW THEY WORKED NOT ONE BUT TWO 
THE CAPTAIN OF X. FIVE WAS HENTY HENTY CREER 
UNLIKE THE CAPTAINS OF X. SIX AND X. SEVEN HE DID NOT RECEIVE THE VICTORIA CROSS 
AS THERE WAS NO PROOF HE HAD LAID HIS EXPLOSIVE CHARGES 
IF IT WAS CERTAIN OR BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT 
THAT X. FIVE HAD CARRIED OUT AN ATTACK 
THEN I THINK THERE WOULD BE A VERY CREDIBLE ARGUMENT 
FOR GIVING HER COMMANDING OFFICER HENTY CREER THE V. C. 
THE DIVERS HAVE SENT A VIDEO OF THE WRECK TO HENTY CREER'S SISTER DEIRDRE 
EVER SINCE HIS DEATH SHE AND HER FAMILY HAVE SOUGHT RECOGNITION 
FOR HIS ROLE IN THE ATTACK ON TIRPITZ 
I'M AFTER HIS HONOUR 
AND IF IT'S HIS BOAT HE DESERVES WHAT HE WENT IN 
TO ACHIEVE AND THAT WAS THE V. C. 
I THINK A MYSTERY IS SOMETHING THAT NAGS ONE THROUGH THE YEARS 
YOU HAVE TO FIND A FINAL ANSWER 
RUBY SIMPSON AND HER FAMILY AREN'T INTERESTED IN HONOURS 
BUT THEY TOO WANT THE MYSTERY OF X. FIVE SOLVED 
RUBY'S BROTHER TOM NELSON WAS ONE OF ITS CREW 
WE DON'T WANT MEDALS WE DON'T WANT MONEY 
WE JUST WANT 
WE'LL NEVER GET TO THE TRUTH 
BUT I'D LOVE TO PROVE THAT HE WENT IN AND DROPPED THOSE CHARGES 
X. FIVE WAS ONE OF SIX MIDGET SUBMARINES BUILT BY VICKERS FOR THE ATTACK ON TIRPITZ 
CODENAMED OPERATION SOURCE THE TOP SECRET MISSION NOW BEGAN IN EARNEST 
THE SIX X. CRAFT WERE TRANSPORTED BY TRAIN TO REMOTEST SCOTLAND WHERE A SECRET BASE WAS SET UP 
THIS SECLUDED HOUSE BESIDE LOCH STRIVEN 
WOULD BE HOME TO THE X. MEN FOR SEVERAL MONTHS 
IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN FORTY TWO THE VOLUNTEERS ARRIVED 
SOME WERE ALREADY IN THE NAVY BUT OTHERS WERE FROM THE ROYAL NAVAL VOLUNTEER RESERVE 
IT WAS AN OLD SHOOTING LODGE 
AND THEY BUILT VARIOUS NISSEN HUTS FOR PETTY OFFICERS AND SAILORS 
AND THE OFFICERS WERE SAT IN THE BIG HOUSE 
WE WERE IN GROUPS IT WAS ALL ENGINE ROOM ARTIFICERS AND OFFICERS AND THE LIKE 
WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TIME FOR THE OFFICERS THEY WERE WITH THE SUB LIEUTENANTS 
THEY HAD A WHITE BAND AROUND THE HAT AND THE NEXT MINUTE WE THEY HAD TO GO ON A FISH AND CHIP COURSE 
THEY COME BACK AND WE HAD TO CALL THEM SIR 
FROM THE OUTSET IT WAS ACCEPTED THAT THIS UNIQUE AND EXPERIMENTAL MISSION WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS 
OPERATION SOURCE REQUIRED BRAVERY AND DARING OF THE HIGHEST ORDER 
TO PENETRATE AN ENEMY FJORD BASICALLY AN ENEMY HARBOUR VERY HEAVILY DEFENDED IN ALL WAYS 
AND TO COME ALONGSIDE AND EVEN UNDER THE ENEMY TO DO YOUR DAMAGE 
THAT REQUIRES BRAVERY OF A PARTICULAR DEGREE AND A PARTICULAR KIND 
WE KNEW FROM THE START THE OBJECT OF THE MIDGET SUBMARINE WAS THE TIRPITZ HAD TO BE GOT 
WE KNEW VERY WELL THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE THE TARGET 
SO WE WERE FULLY AWARE OF WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO AND IT WAS DRUMMED INTO US 
WE WEREN'T SWORN MEN BUT IT WAS DRUMMED INTO US NOT TO SAY ANYTHING TO ANYONE 
SO WHEN YOU WENT ON LEAVE YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE MEETING YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND FAMILY 
YOU HAD TO KEEP QUIET 
TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD TOM NELSON JOINED THE TEAM AS A DIVER ON X. FIVE 
TOM WAS AN EXCELLENT SWIMMER YOU KNOW HE HAD MEDALS AND EVERYTHING FOR SWIMMING 
BUT WE CERTAINLY NEVER KNEW A THING ABOUT MIDGET SUBMARINES 
NOT AT ALL 
THE STORY THAT HE TOLD WAS THAT HE WAS SALVAGING SHIPS THAT HAD BEEN SUNK IN SCOTLAND 
TO PREPARE FOR THE ATTACK ON TIRPITZ 
ALL OF THE VOLUNTEERS HAD TO TRAIN AS DIVERS AND LEARN HOW TO CUT THROUGH ANTI SUBMARINE NETS 
THE DIVER HAD TO EVACUATE THE BOAT AT THIRTY FOOT WHEN SHE WAS NOSE INTO THE NET 
AND MADE VARIOUS CUTS AROUND THE 
THE NET WHILE SHE SLID THROUGH 
THE ONLY SNAG WAS YOU HAD TO BE VERY CAREFUL YOU DIDN'T GET LEFT ON THE NET WHEN SHE 
WHEN SHE'S GONE THEN YOU HAD TO GET BACK IN WITHOUT ANY BUBBLES GOING UP 
THAT WAS THE OBJECT OF THE EXERCISE AND WE ALL HAD TO DO THIS 
LIKE THEIR SUBMARINES THEIR DIVING EQUIPMENT WAS ALSO EXPERIMENTAL 
WE HAD A THING CALLED A SLAVE IN A SUIT AND YOU WERE BREATHING PURE OXYGEN 
AND ER IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT YOU COULD BREATHE 
PURE OXYGEN FOR THREE HOURS AT THIRTY FEET WHICH IS ONE ATMOSPHERE 
GO DOWN TO FIFTY FEET 
IT'S ABOUT HALF AN HOUR 
GO DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED FEET IT'S ABOUT TWO MINUTES AND YOU'RE DEAD OXYGEN POISONING 
THAT ALL HAD TO BE WORKED OUT AND SADLY SOME PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES 
TAFFY THOMAS WAS THE FIRST ONE 
HE ER HE WAS THE FIRST ONE LOST HE WAS LOST OUT OF X. FOUR 
AND THEN ER SUB LIEUTENANT LOCKE HE WAS THE NEXT ONE LOST 
DAVID LOCKE WHO'D JOINED UP WITH ME WAS EXERCISING DOING SOME NET CUTTING IN LOCH STRIVEN 
AND HE CAME OUT AND GAVE THE THUMBS UP THUMB WHICH WAS A SIGN THAT HE EVERYTHING WAS O. K. 
WENT DOWN AND HE'S STILL THERE POOR CHAP 
ER WHICH HAD A VERY NASTY 
FEELING WHEN YOU REALISE SUDDENLY YOU'VE LOST A CHUM 
SOME PEOPLE GOT KICKED OUT AT THAT STAGE 
THEY USED THEY JUST COULDN'T TAKE THE TRAINING AND THE STRAIN 
AND WE LOST QUITE A FEW PEOPLE LIKE THAT SENT BACK TO ER BIG SUBMARINES OR GENERAL SERVICE 
THE NEXT PROBLEM WAS FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET THE MIDGET SUBMARINES TO NORWAY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED MILES AWAY 
SOME EXTRAORDINARILY MAD PERSON IN THE ADMIRALTY SUGGESTED WE MIGHT BE DROPPED BY AIR 
THIS IS TRUE WE WEIGHED THIRTY TWO TONS AND THEY HADN'T EVEN DROPPED A TEN TON BOMB IN THOSE DAYS 
AND THEN SOME VERY GOOD TRAINING OFFICER WE HAD LIEUTENANT HASLETT 
HE SAID WHY NOT TOW A SMALL SUBMARINE WITH A LARGE ONE AND THAT WAS THE ANSWER 
BUT TOWING A SUBMARINE HAD NEVER BEEN ATTEMPTED BEFORE 
AS TRIALS BEGAN IN SCOTLAND TIME WAS ALREADY RUNNING OUT 
THE SUCCESS OF OPERATION SOURCE DEPENDED ON ATTACKING TIRPITZ BEFORE THE END OF AUTUMN 
THE ARCTIC WINTER WOULD MAKE THE MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 
IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE X. CRAFT WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE NO LATER THAN SEPTEMBER THE ELEVENTH 
UP TO DATE INTELLIGENCE ON THE EXACT POSITION OF TIRPITZ WAS CRUCIAL 
ON SEPTEMBER THE SEVENTH A SPITFIRE RECONNAISSANCE FLIGHT LEFT RUSSIA 
AND FLEW OVER THE ANCHORAGE IN THE FJORD 
BUT TIRPITZ WAS NOT THERE 
THE BEAST HAD FLED HER LAIR 
UNKNOWN TO THE ADMIRALTY 
TIRPITZ AND HER BATTLE CREW HAD PUT TO SEA TO ATTACK AN ALLIED RADIO BASE IN SPITZBERGEN 
BRISTLING WITH HEAVY GUNS AND PROTECTED BY TWELVE AND A HALF INCH ARMOUR PLATING 
HER CREW BELIEVED SHE WAS UNSINKABLE 
I SAID TO MYSELF 
MY GOD NOW THERE'S A SHIP 
THE WAR CAN TAKE ONE HUNDRED YEARS NOTHING WILL HARM YOU HERE 
ON SEPTEMBER THE TENTH ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED MILES AWAY 
THE MEN PLANNING TO ATTACK TIRPITZ GATHERED FOR THEIR LAST NIGHT ASHORE 
THE NIGHT BEFORE WE SAILED THE OFFICERS HAD A GLORIOUS BANQUET WITH ALL THE BIGWIGS IN THE WAR ROOM 
BUT WE ENGINE ROOM ARTIFICERS WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DRINK ON BOARD YOU WOULDN'T THINK WE WERE GOING 
NO ONE CAME ANYWHERE NEAR US SO WE HAD TO GO INTO A COWSHED ASHORE WITH A BARREL OF BEER 
AND ER THAT'S WHERE WE CELEBRATED THERE 
THE VOLUNTEERS KNEW THERE WAS A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WOULD NOT COME BACK 
TOM NELSON FROM X. FIVE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE A LAST LETTER HOME 
HE KNEW HE WASN'T COMING BACK 
HE DID 
THIS IS TALKING TO HIS CONTEMPORARIES AT THE TIME THAT THEY WEREN'T COMING BACK 
AND I THINK THEY'D GONE SO FAR WITH THE MISSION I SUPPOSE THEY COULD HAVE CHICKENED OUT AT ANY TIME 
IF THEY FELT THEY COULDN'T DO IT 
DEAR MOTHER AND DAD IT'S AT TIMES LIKE THIS WHEN I THINK 
OF MY EXPERIENCES IN LIFE THAT I OWE EVERYTHING TO YOU 
TO A GOOD UPBRINGING BY THE VERY BEST PARENTS IN THE WORLD 
I CAN NEVER REPAY THE TOIL AND SWEAT 
THAT HAS BEEN BORNE BY BOTH OF YOU TO ME 
AND HELPED RUBY AND MYSELF WHAT WE ARE TODAY 
WITH A VERY BRIGHT FUTURE AND THE START IN LIFE THAT VERY FEW OTHER CHILDREN HAVE HAD AND WITH THAT 
I'LL SAY GOODNIGHT 
ALL MY LOVE TOM 
IN KAAFJORD THE CHANCES OF SOLVING THE MYSTERY OF X. FIVE HAVE TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE 
STUART USHER AND THE DIVERS HAVE COMPARED THE BUILDER'S DRAWINGS OF X. FIVE 
WITH THE WRECK IN THE FJORD AND THEY APPEAR TO BE DIFFERENT 
MY GUT INSTINCT AT THE MOMENT WITH REGARD TO THE WRECK BELOW US IS THAT IT IS NOT X. FIVE 
WHAT WE THEN HAVE TO DO POSSIBLY IS ADOPT A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE SEARCH 
AND FORGET ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A COMPLETE SUBMARINE HERE 
AND BREAK THIS DOWN TAKE A MORE ER FORENSIC APPROACH TO THIS AND START LOOKING AT PIECES 
THE DIVERS NOW TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO LOOKING FOR FRAGMENTS OF AN X. CRAFT 
IF THEY CAN FIND EVIDENCE THAT X. FIVE DID DROP HER SADDLE CHARGES IT WOULD STRENGTHEN 
THE CASE FOR HER CREW TO GET THE RECOGNITION THEIR FAMILIES SEEK 
THEN AGAINST ALL ODDS A REAL FIND 
A PIECE OF AN X. CRAFT 
THAT'S DEFINITELY WHAT WAS USED TO HAUL THE SIDE CHARGE 
ONCE THE SIDE CHARGE WAS OFFERED UP TO THE SUBMARINE 
CLAMPED ONTO THE SIDE THEY THEN TOOK UP THE SLACK IN THE TURN BUCKLES 
AND THAT PULLED THE SIDE CHARGE SNUGLY ONTO THE SIDE OF THE X. CRAFT 
AND I AM ASTONISHED THAT IT'S SO FREE THE MECHANISM IS SO FREE 
IT'S JUST AMAZING LOOK AT IT IT'S FREE AS IF IT WAS ONLY PUT ON THERE YESTERDAY 
SIXTY ONE YEARS IN THE WATER ABSOLUTELY 
AND ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS ANSWERING THE MYSTERY 
AN ASTONISHING FIND 
ON SEPTEMBER THE ELEVENTH THE MOTHER SUBMARINES TOWED THE SIX X. CRAFT FROM THEIR SECRET BASE 
AHEAD OF THEM WAS AN ELEVEN DAY JOURNEY ACROSS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED MILES 
OF THE MOST INHOSPITABLE SEAS ON THE PLANET 
THE CREWS WHO WOULD CARRY OUT THE ATTACK WOULD STAY ON THE TOWING SUBMARINES 
UNTIL THEY REACHED THE NORWEGIAN COAST 
THERE THEY WOULD SWAP WITH THE THREE MAN PASSAGE CREWS FROM THE X. CRAFT 
CONDITIONS ON BOARD WERE PRETTY AWFUL 
AND HUMAN ENDURANCE COULD ONLY TAKE THAT UP TO A CERTAIN POINT 
THAT WAS WHY THEY HAD TO HAVE TWO CREWS 
WITHOUT A PASSAGE CREW TAKING THE SUBMARINE THERE UNDER TOW 
THAT CREW WOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY EXHAUSTED 
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY INCAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT AN ATTACK 
WE ATE VERY LITTLE 
BECAUSE THE MORE YOU EAT THE MORE YOU PASS THROUGH 
AND THAT PRESENTED A PROBLEM 
SO AND WE DIDN'T WASH AND OF COURSE IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE 
AND IT SMELT JUST LIKE NEW MOWN HAY AFTER IT HAD PASSED THROUGH A HORSE 
AND SLEEPING OF COURSE WELL THAT PRESENTED ANOTHER PROBLEM 
ONE HAD TO SLEEP OVER THE BATTERIES UP THE FRONT END 
AND YOU HAD TO SHUT THE BULKHEAD DOORS SO YOU WERE REALLY LOCKED IN A STEEL COFFIN 
GOT VIOLENT HEADACHES AND BAD TUMMIES 
YOU WERE SO RELIEVED WHEN SOMEONE CAME AND OPENED THE BULKHEAD DOOR TO LET YOU OUT 
THREE DAYS AFTER THE X. CRAFT DEPARTED NEW AERIAL PHOTOS ARRIVED AT H. Q. IN BRITAIN 
TIRPITZ WAS BACK IN THE FJORD 
THE NEW INTELLIGENCE WAS SIGNALLED TO THE TOWING SUBMARINES GIVING HER EXACT POSITION 
IT CAME AS A WELCOME DISTRACTION FROM THE BOREDOM OF THE PASSAGE 
TO BE LOCKED UP IN THE TOWING SUBMARINE FOR NINE DAYS WAS MUCH TOO LONG MUCH TOO LONG 
YOUR MIND CAN START WANDERING FOR THAT MATTER 
I DON'T MEAN IT GOT DOWN TO ANY CONCERN ABOUT GOING UNDER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
BUT YOU KEPT THINKING WHAT CAN GO WRONG 
AND OF COURSE IN OUR CASE IT DID GO WRONG 
THE WHOLE THING ACTUALLY WAS A GLORIOUS COCK UP FROM START TO FINISH BECAUSE IT TOOK US 
WE HAD TO GO IN EVENTUALLY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED MILES 
AND NONE OF THE CRAFT HAD BEEN AT SEA FOR MORE THAN ABOUT FIVE CONTINUOUS DAYS 
BUT WE WERE BEING TOWED FOR TEN BLOODY DAYS 
BY WHICH TIME THINGS HAD GONE WRONG 
THE SUCCESS OF THE NAVY'S LATEST PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THE X. CRAFT 
WAS ABOUT TO BE PUT INTO JEOPARDY BY ONE OF ITS OLDEST THE TOWROPES 
OUR TOWROPES IN TRAINING WERE BREAKING RIGHT LEFT AND CENTRE 
AND THEY WERE SPECIALLY MADE TOWROPES FOR THIS JOB THEY WERE MANILLA 
WELL THEN WE GOT HOLD OF A NYLON TOWROPE 
WE HAD NO TROUBLE WHATSOEVER WITH NYLON NONE WHATSOEVER 
AND WHEN THE CRUNCH CAME WHEN WE SAILED YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SURPRISE 
WHEN THERE WAS ONLY THREE NYLON TOWROPES AND THREE MANILLA 
SIX DAYS INTO THE CROSSING DISASTER STRUCK 
X. NINE'S TOWROPE BROKE DRAGGING HER AND HER THREE MAN PASSAGE CREW TO THE BOTTOM 
SHE DIDN'T STAND A HOPE 
SHE HAD ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED F. T. OF TOWROPE HANGING ON HER BOW AND SHE COULD NEVER SURFACE WITH THAT WEIGHT ON 
WE WERE FULL OF APPREHENSION 
WORRIED ABOUT OUR THREE PALS PADDY KEARON FROM NORTHERN IRELAND DIKEY HARTE FROM LONDON 
AND GINGER HOLLETT FROM LIVERPOOL THREE VERY FINE PEOPLE VERY DEDICATED PEOPLE 
AND WE REVERSED COURSE AND FOUND THIS BIG PATCH OF ER DIESEL FUEL WHERE YOU EXPECTED TO FIND X. NINE 
SHE WASN'T THERE WE FOUND THIS DIESEL FUEL SO SHE'D OBVIOUSLY BEEN DRAGGED DOWN TO HER CRUSHING DEPTH 
AND THAT WAS AWFUL 
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WOULD ALSO MEAN THAT X. EIGHT AND X. TEN WOULD NOT MAKE THE FINAL ATTACK INTO KAAFJORD 
THE SUCCESS OF THE MISSION NOW DEPENDED ON JUST THREE MIDGET SUBMARINES 
DAY NINE AND IT WAS TIME FOR THE OPERATIONAL CREWS TO TRANSFER TO THEIR X. CRAFT 
FROM NOW ON THEY WERE ON THEIR OWN 
THROUGH FIFTY MILES OF HEAVILY DEFENDED ENEMY WATERS 
IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER TWO DAYS TO REACH TIRPITZ 
I ALMOST LOST MY NERVE AT THE END OF THE DAY AND SAID TO THE LEADING SEAMAN I CAN'T DO THIS 
AND HE SAID COME ON SIR SEE YOU IN THREE WEEKS' TIME OR A WEEK'S TIME OR SOMETHING 
AND PUSHED ME IN AND AWAY I WENT 
COME ON SIR SEE YOU NEXT WEEK 
I MUST HAVE LOST MY NERVE TEMPORARILY I SUPPOSE 
FROM THE DROP OFF POINT 
THE NEXT OBSTACLE FOR THE X. CRAFT WAS A GERMAN MINEFIELD 
A MINE DRIFTING CAUGHT ON TO THE TOWROPE 
BETWEEN THE LARGE AND SMALL SUBMARINE 
AND DRIFTED DOWN THE TOWROPE 
ONTO THE BOWS OF THE X. CRAFT 
AND THE COMMANDING OFFICER GOT UP AND KICKED IT AWAY 
AFTER CROSSING THE MINEFIELD 
THE THREE TINY X. CRAFT HAD SILENTLY TO PICK THEIR WAY 
INTO THE MOST HEAVILY DEFENDED GERMAN BASE IN NORWAY 
THEY HAD TO PASS RIGHT UNDERNEATH MASSIVE GERMAN GUNS 
TO BE DISCOVERED NOW WOULD SPELL DISASTER FOR THE TWELVE VOLUNTEERS 
IN THESE DEFENSIVE POSITIONS THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF GERMAN SOLDIERS 
BETWEEN THE X. CRAFT AND THE TIRPITZ WERE MANY THOUSAND MORE 
THEY HAD THIS GUN SIGHT HERE IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE THE MOUNTING IS STILL HERE 
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHERE THE MIDGET SUBMARINES CAME THROUGH 
ER OVER THERE 
O. K. OVER HERE AND INTO ALTAFJORD 
INTO ALTAFJORD THEY STAYED OVER THE NIGHT ON BRATTHOLMEN A LITTLE ISLAND IN ALTAFJORD O. K. 
HERE WE HAVE THREE GADGETS IF YOU LIKE MANNED BY A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF 
ONE MIGHT ALMOST CALL THEM NAVAL COMMANDOES ATTACKING THE BIGGEST SHIP IN THE GERMAN NAVY 
YOU CAN'T GET MUCH MORE DRAMATIC THAN THAT 
AFTER SUNSET ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIRST THE X. CRAFT SURFACED TO RECHARGE THEIR BATTERIES 
THE THREE TINY SUBMARINES WERE NOW IN SIGHT OF HITLER'S ENORMOUS BATTLESHIP 
I WAS ON WATCH OUTSIDE ON THE DECK WHILE WE CHARGED THE BATTERIES AND YOU COULD SEE THE TIRPITZ FULLY LIT 
IT WAS THE MOST MAGNIFICENT LOOKING SHIP I'D EVER SEEN 
IT SEEMED AN AWFUL PITY TO BLOW HER UP 
HERE WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GERMAN MAIN NAVAL BASE 
AND NOBODY HAD OBVIOUSLY ANY IDEA WE WERE THERE ALL THE SHIPS WERE FULLY LIT 
ACROSS THE FJORD THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED MEN ON BOARD TIRPITZ HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE BEING WATCHED 
WE FELT TOTALLY SAFE ON BOARD 
THE SHIP WAS ARMOUR PLATED AND WHEN WE WERE AT THE MOORINGS 
WE EVEN RELAXED THE DEGREE OF ALERT 
WE WERE SECURE INSIDE A RING OF NETS 
SO AS FAR AS SECURITY WAS CONCERNED YES WE FELT TOTALLY SAFE 
IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING THE THREE MIDGET SUBMARINES DIVED 
WITH NO MEANS OF COMMUNICATION THEY WOULD ATTACK INDIVIDUALLY 
ONCE INSIDE THE FJORD X. SIX AND X. SEVEN WOULD APPROACH FROM THE EAST 
X. FIVE FROM THE SOUTH 
BUT FIRST THEY HAD TO GET THROUGH THE ANTI SUBMARINE NETS 
X. SIX WAS TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE STROKE OF LUCK 
ALL NETS WORLDWIDE MUST HAVE A. 
A GATE FOR LEGITIMATE TRAFFIC TO GO THROUGH 
AND WE DIVED ABOUT TWO A M. 
AND DONALD CAMERON MY CO SAW A GERMAN TUG WITH A LOT OF GERMAN SAILORS ON BOARD 
GOING THROUGH BACK TO THE TIRPITZ AND THE GATE WAS OBVIOUSLY OPEN 
SO WE SURFACED AND WENT ON TO MAIN ENGINE 
AND FOLLOWED THIS TUG ABOUT SIX F. T. BEHIND IT 
AND WE WERE JOLLY LUCKY COS I THINK MOST OF THE GERMAN SAILORS WERE PROBABLY DRUNK 
HAVING HAD A GOOD NIGHT ASHORE AND THEY NEVER SAW US 
THERE WAS NOTHING NOW BETWEEN THEM AND TIRPITZ 
IT WAS TIME TO PUT THEIR EXPERIMENTAL NEW WEAPON TO USE 
DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR OPERATION SOURCE 
EACH X. CRAFT HAD TWO HUGE EXPLOSIVE SADDLE CHARGES 
WHICH WERE RELEASED FROM INSIDE THE SUBMARINE 
THEY HAD NEVER BEEN USED IN COMBAT BEFORE 
AND NO ONE WAS REALLY CERTAIN WHETHER THEY WOULD WORK 
WE WERE THEN ALMOST ALONGSIDE THE TIRPITZ 
WHEN WE WE STRUCK AN UNCHARTED ROCK 
I SAW SOMETHING WHICH I THOUGHT AT FIRST WAS A DOLPHIN OR A WHALE 
THERE WAS SOMETHING GREY COMING UP SLOWLY TO THE SURFACE 
THE CRASH INTO THE ROCK HAD BADLY DAMAGED X. SIX AND FORCED HER TO THE SURFACE 
I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY SUBMARINE COULD HAVE GOT INSIDE OUR NETS 
I BUMPED INTO MY SUPERIOR AND TOLD HIM THERE WAS A SUBMARINE ON THE PORT SIDE 
SOUND THE ALARM 
THERE REALLY IS A SUBMARINE 
AND THEN THE PERISCOPE MOTOR CAUGHT FIRE 
X. SIX WAS NOW COMPLETELY BLIND AND MORTALLY WOUNDED 
MY CO DONALD CAMERON SAID RIGHT WE'LL JUST GO RIGHT ALONGSIDE THE TIRPITZ AND HIT IT 
RATHER CHEEKY ACTUALLY RAMMED IT 
AND THEN WE WENT DOWN 
LAID A CHARGE 
AND THEN WE SURFACED UP ALONGSIDE THE TIRPITZ LAID THE SECOND CHARGE 
HAVING DROPPED HER CHARGES AND WITH NO MEANS OF GETTING AWAY 
THE CAPTAIN OF X. SIX DECIDED TO SCUTTLE THE SUBMARINE AND SURRENDER 
THE SECOND SUBMARINE X. SEVEN HAD ALSO MADE IT PAST THE NETS 
AND DROPPED BOTH HER SADDLE CHARGES UNDER TIRPITZ 
THE PROBLEM WAS HAVING PRIMED THEM TO EXPLODE 
THEY COULDN'T FIND THEIR WAY BACK OUT PAST THE NETS TO SAFETY 
AND THAT WAS I SUPPOSE THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME OF THE WHOLE OPERATION 
BECAUSE DEPTH CHARGES STARTED GOING OFF 
BADLY DAMAGED BY THE EXPLOSIONS X. SEVEN WAS FORCED TO THE SURFACE 
HER COMMANDING OFFICER GOT OUT BUT IMMEDIATELY REALISED THAT X. SEVEN WAS ABOUT TO FLOOD AND SHUT THE HATCH 
I WAS COMING UP TRYING TO PUSH IT OPEN 
SOME WATER FLOODED IN 
WE THEN WENT DOWN WE SAT ON THE BOTTOM TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO NEXT 
THE ONLY CHANCE OF ESCAPE FOR THE THREE REMAINING CREW WAS TO FLOOD THE SUBMARINE 
SO THEY COULD REOPEN THE HATCH AND ESCAPE USING EMERGENCY BREATHING APPARATUS 
BUT IT WOULD TAKE AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR THE SUBMARINE TO FLOOD AND OXYGEN WAS AT A PREMIUM 
DURING THAT TIME 
ONE HAD NOTHING TO DO EXCEPT WAIT 
AND WHEN THE WATER HAD GOT I SUPPOSE MORE OR LESS UP TO WAIST LEVEL 
UM THE BATTERIES FUSED AND THE FUMES CAME AND WE HAD TO START BREATHING OXYGEN 
AND JUST WAIT FOR THE WATER TO GET HIGHER AND HIGHER 
AND OF COURSE AS SOON AS WE WENT ONTO OXYGEN WHEN THE FUMES CAME 
WE COULD NOT HAVE ANY CONTACT COULDN'T TALK TO EACH OTHER 
AND THERE WERE NO LIGHTS WE COULDN'T SEE EACH OTHER 
AND SO WE WERE LEFT TO OUR OWN THOUGHTS 
AFTER AN HOUR AND A HALF ON THE BOTTOM X. SEVEN WAS AT LAST FULL OF WATER 
AND ROBERT AITKEN MANAGED TO OPEN THE HATCH TO ESCAPE 
AND I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A VERY SATISFACTORY ESCAPE 
AND REMEMBER THINKING HOW PLEASED CHADWICK MY INSTRUCTOR 
WOULD HAVE BEEN TO SEE THAT I WAS CARRYING OUT THE CORRECT DRILL 
THE REMAINING TWO CREW MEMBERS OF X. SEVEN BILL WHITLEY AND BILL WHITTAM DIED ON THE SEABED 
BY THIS TIME JOHN LORIMER AND THE CREW OF X. SIX WERE PRISONERS ON BOARD TIRPITZ 
THEY WERE VERY SURPRISED TO SEE US VERY SURPRISED TO SEE US 
I REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF I DON'T GIVE SIXPENCE FOR MY BLOODY LIFE 
NOW I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF THOSE 
RIFLES 
THE CREW OF TIRPITZ WERE NOW AT ACTION STATIONS AND THE CAPTAIN ORDERED THE SHIP TO BE MOVED 
THE VOLUNTEERS KNEW THAT THEIR SADDLE CHARGES WERE ABOUT TO EXPLODE BENEATH THEM 
SHIP'S DIVER HELMUT SEMON WAS TOLD TO GET INTO A LAUNCH AND FIND OUT WHAT THE SUBMARINES HAD PLANTED 
WE NOTICED THEY KEPT ON LOOKING AT THEIR WATCHES LIKE THIS 
THEY WERE ALWAYS LOOKING AT THEIR WATCHES THEN WE SAID TO OURSELVES WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN 
OF COURSE WE HAD NO TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT ANY FURTHER WE HAD OTHER WORRIES 
BUT WE KNEW THEY WERE LOOKING AT THEIR WATCHES WHY 
I WAS BEING INTERROGATED BY THE COMMANDER WHO THE FUNNY THING IS 
THERE WERE OVER TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE ON BOARD THE SHIP AND THERE WAS ONLY NOBODY SPOKE REALLY GOOD ENGLISH 
AND THE COMMANDER SAID TO ME YOU WAS BORN WAS YOU 
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT'S MY DATE OF BIRTH HE'S ASKING FOR 
AT WHICH TIME EIGHT TONS OF AMATOL WENT OFF 
THERE WAS A GIGANTIC EXPLOSION 
THAT LIFTED US ALL THE WAY UP THE SHIP'S SIDE 
SO HIGH YOU COULD SEE THE SHIP'S DECK FROM ABOVE 
ALTHOUGH WE WERE SIX METRES BELOW 
THE SHIP WAS LIFTED UP AND THEN IT SUNK BACK IN THE WATER 
BUT THE IMPACT WAS SO GREAT THAT WE HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE WITH BROKEN LEGS 
THEY LINED US UP IN FRONT OF A FIRING SQUAD 
AND A LITTLE CHAP WITH A REVOLVER WAS RUSHING ROUND THREATENING TO KILL US 
THE GERMAN ADMIRAL WHO'D HEARD A BANG WHO'D BEEN SOMEWHERE ASHORE 
CAME ALONG AND SAID YOU CAN'T SHOOT THESE CHAPS THEY'RE PRISONERS 
THAT'S WHY I'M TALKING TO YOU NOW 
TIRPITZ WAS SO BADLY DAMAGED SHE WAS NEVER FULLY OPERATIONAL AGAIN 
THE SADDLE CHARGES HAD DONE THEIR JOB 
THE COMMANDING OFFICERS OF X. SIX AND X. SEVEN WERE AWARDED THE VICTORIA CROSS 
THEIR CREWS THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE ORDER 
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE THIRD SUBMARINE X. FIVE 
DID SHE TOO MAKE HER ATTACK 
ONE OF THE LAST PEOPLE TO SEE HER WAS JOHN LORIMER 
LOOKING OVER THE STARBOARD SIDE OF THE TIRPITZ 
I WAS HORRIFIED TO SEE A PERISCOPE 
WHICH COULD ONLY BE X. FIVE AND THE GERMANS SAW IT THE SAME TIME AS I DID 
AND THEY GOT A DIRECT HIT FROM A FOUR INCH AND IT DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE WAVES 
X. FIVE AND HER CREW WERE NEVER SEEN AGAIN 
THEY WERE NOT DECORATED FOR THEIR PART IN THE MISSION 
WE DON'T KNOW IF SHE CARRIED OUT AN ATTACK AND THAT REALLY IS THE KEY ISSUE 
WAS X. FIVE HELD OFF BY THE NETS 
DID SHE GIVE UP OR DID SHE IN FACT PENETRATE THE NETS 
AND LAY AT LEAST ONE OR POSSIBLY BOTH CHARGES UNDER THE GERMAN BATTLESHIP WE JUST DON'T KNOW 
BUT THAT'S A KEY ISSUE BECAUSE IF IT WAS KNOWN THAT SHE HAD DONE THAT 
HER CO WOULD HAVE RECEIVED A VICTORIA CROSS WITH THE OTHER TWO X. CRAFT COS 
SIXTY ONE YEARS LATER THE NORWEGIAN DIVERS BELIEVE THEY MAY BE CLOSE 
TO SHEDDING NEW LIGHT ON THE MYSTERY OF X. FIVE AND WHETHER SHE MADE HER ATTACK 
ONE FORTY F. T. BELOW THEY MAKE AN ASTONISHING AND SINISTER DISCOVERY 
AN UNEXPLODED TWO TON SADDLE CHARGE 
IT CAN ONLY HAVE COME FROM AN X. CRAFT 
WELL NOW THERE'S A SURPRISE 
LOOK THERE THEY ARE THAT'S ONE OF THAT'S ONE OF THE ATTACHMENTS 
YEAH IT IS FOR CLAMPING IT ONTO THE SIDE OF THE X. CRAFT ISN'T IT 
YES I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT 
THIS IS ONE OF THE SADDLE CHARGES LEFT BEHIND BY AN X. CRAFT 
NOW THAT'S A FIND AND A HALF ISN'T IT 
SINCE IT WAS LIFTED INTO POSITION IN LOCH CAIRNBAWN BEFORE THE ATTACK IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE 
AND I AM FRANKLY ASTONISHED THAT WE ARE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS PIECE OF KIT I REALLY AM 
BUT CAN THIS REMARKABLE DISCOVERY HELP TO RESOLVE 
THE MYSTERY OF WHETHER X. FIVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED HER ATTACK 
THE OBVIOUS QUESTION THAT THAT ARISES WITH 
FINDING THIS IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS ONE OF HENTY CREER'S CHARGES 
ER AND THAT AND THAT RAISES A PHENOMENAL ER ISSUE HERE 
BECAUSE HENTY CREER'S INVOLVEMENT IN OPERATION SOURCE 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SOURCE OF GREAT CONTENTION 
AN ADDED DIMENSION IF YOU WILL TO THIS ENDURING MYSTERY OF X. FIVE 
WITH THE HELP OF MILITARY SOFTWARE SPECIALISTS THE EXACT POSITION 
OF THE SADDLE CHARGE IS FIXED ON AN ADMIRALTY CHART 
THIS IS THEN MATCHED TO AN R. A. F. RECONNAISSANCE PHOTOGRAPH OF TIRPITZ TAKEN THE DAY AFTER THE ATTACK 
THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE UNEXPLODED CHARGE 
IS OUTSIDE THE NETS BUT JUST NINETY METRES FROM TIRPITZ 
THAT'S ASTONISHING I CAN'T 
I CAN HARDLY CREDIT THAT THAT CHARGE IS LYING THERE 
ALL THE RECORD BOOKS SAY THAT THE FOUR CHARGES THAT WERE LAID WERE ALL LAID INSIDE THE CONFINES OF THE NET 
X. SIX DROPPED TWO CHARGES UNDER THE PORT BOW OF TIRPITZ 
AND X. SEVEN DROPPED ONE CHARGE UNDER THE MIDSHIP SECTION AND ONE SLIGHTLY TOWARDS THE STERN 
SO IF WE'VE GOT FOUR CHARGES GOING OFF INSIDE HERE AND ONE LYING THERE 
IT CAN ONLY HAVE COME FROM X. FIVE 
NOW THAT WILL THROW THE RECORDS INTO A BIT OF A TIZZ I THINK 
THE DISCOVERY OF THE UNEXPLODED SIDE CHARGE AROUND HERE 
IN MY OPINION CONFIRMS THAT ATTACK TOOK PLACE IN THIS AREA IT CAN ONLY BE X. FIVE 
BUT THEN THE BIG QUESTION WHERE'S THE OTHER SIDE CHARGE 
THE ONLY PLAUSIBLE SOLUTION IT SEEMS TO ME IS THAT THAT SECOND SIDE CHARGE OF X. FIVE'S 
WAS PLACED UNDER TIRPITZ AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE EXPLOSIONS THAT DAMAGED THE SHIP SO SERIOUSLY 
WHETHER OR NOT WE EVER FIND X. FIVE 
THERE IS A GOOD ARGUMENT I THINK 
FOR RECOGNISING HENTY CREER'S BRAVERY 
THE FACT THAT HE DID GET VERY CLOSE TO TIRPITZ 
THE FACT THAT THERE IS A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY THAT HE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DAMAGE THAT TIRPITZ SUFFERED 
AND PERHAPS WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET A LITTLE MORE EVIDENCE ON THAT 
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE AT LEAST SYMMETRICAL TO RECOGNISE 
THAT ALL THREE COMMANDERS SHOWED EXCEPTIONAL BRAVERY 
IN INFLICTING DAMAGE ON THE TIRPITZ IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN FORTY THREE 
IT'S NEVER LEFT US 
WE HAVE NEVER EVER NOT THOUGHT OF HIM 
IN EVERY WAY 
THE FOCUS NATURALLY LANDS ON THE SURVIVORS 
BUT UM ONE HAS TO REMEMBER THAT THEY'RE ONLY REPRESENTATIVES 
OF A MUCH LARGER BODY OF MEN WHO WERE ALL ESSENTIAL TO THE OPERATION OF SOURCE 
TOM WAS A BRAVE FELLA 
AND WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT WE DID PRODUCE MEN LIKE THAT 
EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR FAMILY I SUPPOSE 
I'VE GOT A LOVELY POEM 
WHEN HALTS THEE MY EARTHLY ROUNDABOUT 
AND MUSIC DIES AND LIGHTS GO OUT 
BURY ME NOT IN SICKLY MOULD FOR EARTHLY WORMS TO PLUNDER 
BUT SINK ME DEEP BY DOWN AND HEAD WHERE CORAL SPRAYS SHALL BE MY BED 
AND SEA FLOWERS BLOSSOM WHITE AND RED TEN FATHOMS UNDER
