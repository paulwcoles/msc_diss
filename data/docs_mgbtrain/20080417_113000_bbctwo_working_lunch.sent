GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO WORKING 
LUNCH DELAYS IN PAYMENTS AND THE 
LOSS OF THOUSANDS OF POUNDS 
THOUSAND TAKEOVER OF ONE PENSION 
PROVIDER IS CAUSING A HEADACHE FOR 
CUSTOMERS THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
ANNOUNCES A NEW PLAN TO HELP EASE 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH WILL IT WORK 
RARE SUNSHINE ON THE HIGH STREET AS 
SMITH REPORT A RISE IN PROFIT 
AND LIVING WITHOUT YOUR LUGGAGE 
HOW YOU CAN SURVIVE ON HOLIDAY WHEN 
YOUR BAGGAGE DOES NOT TURN UP AND AND THE SHARES THAT MAY DO WELL IN A 
SLOW DOWN 
BUT FIRST A PENSIONS 
LOGJAM HAS LEFT THOUSANDS WAITING 
FOR PAYMENTS ONE VIEWER SAYS THE 
DELAY HAS COST HIM ELEVEN THOUSAND THEIR 
POLICIES WITH WERE A COMPANY CHA 
USED TO BE CALLED N. H. LIFE THAT WAS 
TAKEN OVER BY WINDSOR LIFE THEY 
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THE 
LEVEL OF CALLS SINCE THE MERGER 
WINDSOR LIFE IS A SUBSIDIARY OF THE 
COMPANY SWISS RE THAT USED TO OWN 
THE BER GIN GHERKIN BUILDING IN 
LONDON IT HAS TAKEN O' OVER A 
STRING OF U. K. LIFE AND PENSIONS 
CONCERNS WHILE WINDSOR CAN HAVE 
LIFE EXPECTED THREE THOUSAND CUSTOMER CALLS 
A WEEK ITS HAD EIGHTEEN THOUSAND IT STARTS 
WITH WINDSOR'S TAKEOVER LAST YEAR 
OF THE FORMER CUSTOMERS OF A 
COMPANY CALLED TOMORROW WHICH USED 
TO BE CALLED G. E. 
LIFE IT HAD 
POLICIES THAT WERE UNDER THE BANNER 
OF N. M. CAN HAVE LIFE AND PENSIONS 
THESE CUSTOMERS HAVE FACED THE 
DELAYS 
DELAYS 
THIS IS SERIOUS WE HAVE DELAYS SEEN BEFORE COMPANIES ACQUIRING THE 
BUSINESS OF OTHER COMPANIES WITH A 
VIEW TO DELIVERING THE SERVICE AT A 
SORT OF PROFIT TAKING ACCOUNT OF 
ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND OFTEN THEY 
ARE THEY DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY BUT 
IT MUST NOT BE DONE AT THE EXPENSE 
OF THE CUSTOMERS 
MONEY SAVED OVER 
THE YEARS IN PERSONAL PENSION 
POLICIES HAS TO BE CASHED IN HEN 
RETIREMENT APPROACHES AND SPENT ON 
PIEING A REGULAR RETIREMENT INCOME 
CALLED AN ANNUITY IF THE SPOCK 
MARKET FALLS BEFORE THE POLICY IS 
CASHED IN THE SIZE OF THAT INCOME 
IS REDUCED 
SO ONE CUSTOMER 
IS REDUCED SO ONE CUSTOMER TRANSFERRED 
TRANSFERRED REG IS WORRIED THAT 
THE WILLING JAM MAY HAVE REDUCED 
THE SIZE OF HIS PENSION IN 
DECEMBER HE ASKED TO TAKE HIS 
PENSION AND WAS TOLD THE FUND WAS 
WORTH FORTY THREE THOUSAND THE REGULAR PAYMENTS 
DIDN'T START WHEN HE HAD ASKED 
THEN LATE IN FEBRUARY HIS PENSION 
OFFER WAS MADE ON THE BASE IS OF 
OBEY SIS OF A FUND VALUE OF 
THIRTY TWO THOUSAND SO ELEVEN THOUSAND LEFT 
I BELIEVE 
THEY HAVE BEEN SITTING ON IT AND IT 
HAS DROPPED WHETHER IT IS DOWN TO 
THE DROP IN INTEREST RATES THE 
STEK MARKET BUT EVEN SO THEY 
SHOULD HAVE PAID ME OUT AT THE DATE 
I ASKED 
WINDSOR LIFE SAYS NO 
CUSTOMER WILL SUFFER FROM ANY 
MISTAKES IT HAS MADE BUT IT IS 
DIFFICULT FOR POLICY HOLDERS TO 
KNOW HOW MUCH THEY MAY HAVE LOST 
OUT 
IT IS A DIFFICULT AREA IF OUT SOMEBODY HAS ACTUALLY INCURRED A 
DELAY AND HAS SUFFERED FINANCIAL 
LOSS BECAUSE THEIR PENSION POT HAS 
DROPPED IN VALUE FROM THE DATE WHEN 
THEY SHOULD HAVE GOT IT TO THE DATE 
THEY ARE GOING TO GET IT THEN THEY 
WILL HAVE CERTAINLY A CLAIM FOR 
COMPENSATION ON THE GROUNDS OF 
FINANCIAL LOSS 
PEOPLE 
RECEIVING THEIR PENSIONS APPEAR TO 
BE AFFECTED BY DELAYS WINDSOR LIFE 
SAID IT HAD PROBLEMS INTEGRATING 
COMPUTER SYSTEMS ONE VIEWER TOLD 
US HE EXPECTED HIS AN YOUTY PAYMENT 
MADE ONCE A YEAR ON FOURTH APRIL AND 
IT DID NOT COME AND ONLY APRIEVED 
ON FIFTEENTH AFTER WORKING EARRIVED 
AFTER WE HIGHLIGHTED THE CASE WITH 
WINDSOR 
WINDSOR LIFE 
IT IS IMPORTANT THEY 
GET THIS MONEY ON TIME IT IS ALL 
PAID ON FOURTH APRIL L. HAVE ARRANGED 
ALL MY ANNUAL BILLS LIKE CAR 
INSURANCE ROAD TAX TO COME WITHIN 
THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL IT DIDN'T 
ARRIVE ON THE FOURTH APRIL IN FACT IT 
DIDN'T ARRIVE UNTIL A COUPLE OF 
DAYS AGO THANKS TO YOUR PROGRAMME 
MEAN WHILE ADVISORS WHO SHOP AROUND 
FOR SAVERS TRYING TO FIND THEM THE 
BEST AN YOUTYS SAY THE DELAYS 
ANNUITIES ARE EXCEPTIONALLY BAD 
THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS WITH 
THAT TOMORROW FUND PASSED TO 
WINDSOR LIFE AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED COME 
PLAINTHS COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN 
RECEIVED WE HAVE JOINED BY THE 
MANAGING DIRECTOR OF WINDSOR LIFE 
WATCHING THIS STORY I FIND IT HARD 
TO THINK OF ANYTHING MORE SENSITIVE 
AS FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT THAN 
ONE'S PENSION YOU WORK ALL YOUR 
LIFE AND YOU NEED THAT MONEY YOU 
NEED A GUARANTEE IT IS GOING TO BE 
SAFE WHY HAVE YOU LET THESE PEOPLE 
DOWN 
AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAY FROM DOWN OUR VIEW WE REGRET WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED AND WE ARE LOOKING TO PUT 
IT RIGHT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
IN TERM OF WHAT 
WE WERE LOOKING TO DO WE DID TWO 
THINGS FIRST WE TRANSFERRED THE 
POLICIES FROM THE N. M. COMPANIES INTO 
WINDSOR LIFE LAST YEAR THAT WAS A 
CORE PROCESS THAT INVOLVED A LARGE 
MEASURE OF NOTIFICATION TO TO PL SI 
HOLDERS IT TWHAUZ NOTIFICATION 
WHICH GAVE RISE TO A LARGE NUMBER 
OF CALLS TO THE COMPANY ASKING 
WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
YOU MUST HAVE 
KNOWN THE CALLS WERE GOING TO COME 
THE PEOPLE WORKING THE FUND WOULD 
SAY THIS IS HOW MANY CALLS WE GET 
WELL I THINK THAT IS NOT THE CASE 
WHAT WE FOUND WE HAVE OWNED THIS 
BUSINESS SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX SO WE HAVE 
CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MANY 
CALLS WE WOULD GET ON REGULAR 
BASIS YOU RIGHTLY HIGHLIGHTED THE 
ACTUAL NUMBER WENT UP FROM 
SOMETHING IN THE RANGE OF TO TO 
THREE THOUSAND A WEEK TO EIGHTEEN THOUSAND IN A WEEK'S 
TIME THAT WAS A LARGE INCREASE 
SOMETHING WHICH WE WERE NOT 
RESOURCED TO DEAL WITH AT THAT TIME 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT NOW 
ARE YOU GOING TO THE OLD SYSTEM IN IN TERMS OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT 
WAS NOT THE PROBLEM THE ACTUAL 
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS RESOURCED THE 
CALL CENTRE TO A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL 
WE HAVE DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE THERE AND THEY ARE GETTING 
ON TOP OF THE CALLS AND THE WAITING 
TIMES ARE REDUCED FROM WHAT THEY 
WERE ONCE THE POINT AT WHICH THE 
TRANSFER HAD GONE THROUGH 
YOUR OWN 
INDUSTRY NICK NAMES YOUR PROCESS 
HERE AS VULTURE FUNDS ARE THEY NOT 
RIGHT YOU COMING IN TAKING IN 
ASSET STRIPPING TOUT VALUE AND 
NAILING DOWN THE SALES COST AND THE 
PEOPLE WHO SUFFER ARE THE 
CUSTOMERS 
I DON'T ACCEPT THEY CUSTOMERS OFFER U. SUFFER 
WELL THEY SEEM TO 
BE 
THEY HAVE IN THIS CASE BUT WE BE DO REGRET THAT I'M LOOKING TO PUT 
THAT RIGHT BUT ON THE ISSUE OF 
FUNDS THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPANIES 
IN THE U. K. LIKE INSURANCE COMPANIES 
CONSOLIDATED MASSIVELY AND LOT HAS 
BEEN DRIVEN BY PEOPLE CUTTING OUT 
THE SELLING SIDE OF THEIR BUSINESS 
IN ORDER TO THEN TAKE FORWARD THE 
BUSINESS IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO 
BRING THEM TOGETHER INTO WHAT YOU 
CALL VULTURE FUNDS 
LET'S CUT TO 
THE CHASE WE HAVE HEARD REG THERE 
HE HAS HAD A DROP IN HIS FUND HE 
FEELS HE WAS GIVEN A CERTAIN FIGURE 
I HAVE SEEN IN THE PRESS YOU SEEM 
TO BE GUARANTEEING THEY WILL GET 
THEIR MONEY BACK WILL REG GET HIS 
MONEY BACK 
EACH CASE WHERE 
SOMEBODY HAS SUFFERED LOSS WILL BE 
INVESTIGATED AND THAT LOSS WILL BE 
MADE GOOD 
DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE A 
RECORD OF THIS CALL BECAUSE PEOPLE 
RING IN GOOD FAITH THAT IS WHAT 
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT EVERYONE EVERYONE WHO HAS SUFFERED A LOSS AND THAT 
HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION 
WE ARE INVESTIGATING THESE AS WELL 
WE WILL THEY WILL BE COMPENSATED 
THE INVESTIGATION IT VERY THOROUGH 
AND OUR REGULATOR LOOKS AT THIS 
CAREFULLY 
WHAT SORT OF CORPORATE CAREFULLY MENTALLY LIES BEHIND THE DECISION 
WHEN THE PEOPLE ARE IN TROUBLE TO 
SET UP A PREMIUM RATE LINE SO WHEN 
THEY HANGING ON FOR THIRTY FIVE MINUTES 
THEY ARE PAYING MORE THAT CLASSIC 
RUBBING PEOPLE'S NOSES IN THE DIRT 
THIS WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION 
ABOUT THE CONCERNS WITH THIS FROM 
OUR VIEW WE USE WHAT IS CALLED 
ON OH EIGHT SEVEN OH NUMBER WE USE THAT TO 
TRANSFER CALLS BETWEEN THE 
OPERATING CENTRES THAT WE RUN IT 
WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE A PREMIUM 
RATE OR SOME SORT OF INCOME 
GENERATION FOR US WE TAKE NO 
INCOME FROM THESE CALLS GOING 
FORWARD I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE 
OFCOM THE REGULATOR ADDRESS THIS 
AND COME UP WITH LOW COST LINE 
FOR PEOPLE TO USE 
THE F. S. A. HAVE THE 
POWERS TO INVESTIGATE SYSTEMIC MIS 
SELLING ARE YOU EXPECTING AN 
INVESTIGATION 
THERE HAS BEEN NO INVESTIGATION MIS SELLING IN TERMS OF THE 
QUALITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION WE 
HAVE MAINTAINED ON OPEN DIALOGUE 
WITH THE F. S. S. ABOUT ALL THE ISSUES 
THAT WE HAVE FACED AND AS FAR AS 
I'M AWARE THEY ARE HAPPY THAT WE 
ARE BRINGING THESE UNDER CONTROL 
THANK YOU THE MARKETS NOW WE HAVE 
GOT A RETAILER WITH GOOD NEWS 
SMITH REPORTED A RISE IN PROFITS 
THEIR SHARES ARE DOWN OVER THE YEAR 
BUT THEN SO ARE THE VAST MAJORITY 
OF THE RETAIL SECTOR IN FACT I 
KNOW OF ONE SHARE THAT HAS RISEN IN 
THAT SECTOR OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS 
SMITHS HAS BEEN BEING DOING 
BETTER THE FIRST HALF TAXES OF SIXTY FOUR 
THAT RISE OF ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT HOWEVER 
I DON'T WISH TO RAIN ON THEIR 
PARADE HIGH STREET SALES WERE DOWN 
THREE PER CENT INTERESTINGLY TRAVEL REVENUES 
INCREASED BY ONE PER CENT DRIVEN BY THE 
AIRPORTS BUSINESS THE GROUP SAID 
THE TRAVEL BUSINESS WAS HELPED BY 
CHANGES AND SUCCESSFUL PROMOTIONS 
IF PEOPLE GET DELAYED IN AIRPORTS 
MORE THEY MAY SPEND MORE AT 
SMITHS THEIR SHARES ARE UP TODAY 
HERE WILL SOME OF THE OTHERS 
DEBENHAMS ARE DOWN KESA WHICH OWNS 
COMET ARE UP AND D. S. G. THAT WAS 
DIXONS AND OWNS CURRYS THEIR 
SHARES ARE UP ALMOST ONE PER CENT NOW MORE 
OF THE MORE WIDELY SHARES 
YESTERDAY WAS STRONG WITH 
WIDESPREAD RISES ALLIANCE AND AMP 
LEICESTER ARE UP H. BANK OF 
SCOTLAND AND LLOYD'S THERE ARE 
SOME STRENGTHS IN THE BANKS WE 
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FINANCIAL 
SERVICES INDUSTRY PRUE DEB SHALL 
REPORTED A FOURTEEN PER CENT RISE IN SALES 
PRUDENTIAL THEY SAID INSURANCE 
SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS WERE SEVEN 
TWENTY NINE MILLION DESPITE THAT GOOD NEWS 
THEIR SHARES ARE DOWN ALMOST TWO PER CENT 
THE SECTOR IS ALMOST SPLIT INTO TWO 
BUT OVER THE PAST YEAR WE COULDN'T 
FIT EVERYONE IN BUT IT SHOWS YOU 
THE PROBLEMS FRIENDS PROVIDENT 
USING FORTY PER CENT OF THEIR VALUE THE ONLY 
ONE WITH ANY STRENGTH IS RESOLUTION 
THEY UP TEN PER CENT AVIVA IS DOWN ALMOST A 
FIFTH THAT IS AGAINST THE MARKET 
WHICH HAS FALLEN SOME SIX PER CENT SO WORSE 
THAN THE AVERAGE THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IS 
DOWN BUT WE ARE ABOVE THE SIX THOUSAND 
LEVEL F. T. S. E. NOW AT SIX THOUSAND TWENTY EIGHT THE 
TREASURY COULD ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF 
PLANS TO HELP THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND ARE WORKING OUT DEAL 
THE PEEB'S ECONOMICS EDITOR JOINS 
ME NOW B. B. C.'S. HEAR THE SOUND OF 
A LARGE STABLE DOOR BOLTING IS IT 
TOO LATE 
ON THIS OCCASION YOU MAY 
BE UNFAIR 
TOO LATE BE UNFAIR 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF 
DOOR CLOSING WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT 
REGULATING THINGS IN THE FUTURE 
THIS IS ACTUALLY DESIGNED IT IS OF 
A PIECE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER 
THINGS THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS DONE 
AND FEDERAL RESERVE HAS DONE A LOT 
MORE OF SINCE LAST AUTUMN THEY 
HAVE LOOKED AT WHERE THE LIQUIDITY 
PROBLEMS STILL R. LIE THE RATES ARE 
STILL HIGH AND THEY SAW 
PARTICULARLY IN AN AUCTION THIS 
WEEK THIS WAS A GAP IN THE LONGER 
TERM LENDING THEY WERE GIVING THE 
THREE MONTH TYPE MONEY TO BANKS WHO 
NEEDED IT BUT NOW THEY ARE LOOKING 
AT THE LONGER TERM THIS I THINK 
THIS SCHEME WILL BE FILLING A HOLE 
IN THE SENSE IT WILL OFFERING THE 
SWAPPING OF BONDS FOR ASSETS FOR 
OVER A YEAR 
TO GO INTO THE DETAIL 
IT IS A GAME OF SWAP THEY ARE 
SWAPPING THESE MORTGAGES FOR THE 
SAFER BONDS ONE QUESTION IS WILL 
IT BE THE HIGHER RATE PREMIUM 
MORTGAGE THERE IS A GO INTO THE 
FUND OR THE SUB PRIME 
IT WILL BE 
BONDS THAT ARE BASED ON MORTGAGES 
BUT IT IS THE SAME THING THEY HAVE 
NOT DECIDED THEY KNOW IT WILL BE 
THE THEY WILL INCLUDE THE HIGHER 
QUALITY MORTGAGE ASSETS WHICH THEY 
HAVE BEEN DOING IN THESE SPECIAL 
AUCTIONS ON A SHORTER TIME FRAME 
THEY I THINK THEY KEEN TO EXTEND IT 
A BIT BUT IT WON'T BE THE DROSS 
IT WON'T BE THE REAL SUB PRIME 
STUFF YOU NOT HELPING OUT THE BANK 
WHO IS MADE MISTAKES 
IS IT GOING TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
TO THE DAY TO DAY LIVES OF PEOPLE 
ATTEMPTING TO GET FUNDING FOR THEIR 
HOUSES 
THIS ISN'T AN ATTEMPT TO HOUSES PROP UP MORTGAGES THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND WILL BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT 
THAT'S NOT THEIR JOOB BUT THE PLAN 
IS IF THE BANKS ARE ABLE TO BECOME 
IF THEIR MARKETS ARE MORE LIQUID 
AND CAN EXCHANGE MORE CASH BETWEEN 
EACH OTHER THAT WILL MAKE THEM MORE 
WILLING TO LEND ALL OF US AND PUSH 
DOWN RATES BUT WE CAN'T EXPECT 
MIRACLES HEERL THE PROPERTY MARKET 
IS NOT WHAT IT WAS A YEAR AGO 
IF YOU'RE A LENDER LOOKING AT 
SOMEONE WITHOUT A DEPOSIT YOU MIGHT 
NOT THINK IT'S WORTH IT GIVING 
SOMEONE A ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGE BECAUSE 
HOUSE PRICES MAY GO DOWN WHEREAS 
YEAR A AGO WHEN YOU EXPECTED HOUSE 
PRICES TO GO UP YOU WOULD HAVE 
DONE WE CAN'T EXPECT MIRACLES 
THAT EVERYTHING WILL GO BACK TO 
NORMAL BECAUSE THERE IS A 
CORRECTION GOING ON IN THE PROPERTY 
MARKET BUT THE AUTHORITIES WANT TO 
MAKE SURE THERE'S NO OVERSHOOTING 
THAT THE MARKETS AREN'T BEING TOO 
PESSIMISTIC 
MORTGAGE HOLDERS ARE PESSIMISTIC USUALLY TAX PAYERS THERE IS A FEAR 
IN SOME AREAS THAT WE THE TAX 
PAYERS MAY FUND THE BILL IF 
THERE'S HIGH RISK INVOLVED IS THE 
RISK GOING TO THE BANKS OR ARE WE 
FACING THE BANKS 
THE GOVERNOR OF 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND SAID ALL ALONG 
NOT ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR SCHEME 
BUT ABOUT ANY FUTURE SCHEME THE 
RISK WOULD HAVE TO STAY WITH THE 
BANKS THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING 
TO VERY HARD TO DESIGN THE SCHEME 
TO DO WHEN WE GET ALL THE DETAILS 
WE CAN ASSESS WHETHER THEY'VE 
MANAGED THAT OR NOT BECAUSE IT'S A 
PRETTY HARD TRICK THE PLAN IS FOR 
EXAMPLE THEY WOULD ONLY ACCEPT 
THESE MORTGAGE ASSETS AT A DISCOUNT 
IN A SENSE THERE WILL BE A MARGIN 
FOR ERROR THERE IF THEY GOT THE 
VALUE WRONG OR IF THE VALUE FELL WE 
WOULD HAVE A LOT OF PROTECTION AS 
TAX PAYERS 
AND FINALLY WE HEARD A TAX PAYERS LOT OF THIS PHRASE MORAL HAZARD 
WHERE THE BANKS HAVE BEEN LENDING 
WILLY NILLY THEY'VE CUT BACK ON 
THAT DOES BEING BAILED OUT BY THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND TEMPT THEM TO BE 
LESS MORALLY STABLE IN THE FUTURE 
IF THEY DO THIS THE BANK WOULD NOT 
CONSIDER THIS TO BE A BAIL OUT IF 
THE RISK IS NOT TRANSFERRED THEY'RE 
TO THE BEING BAILED OUT WHAT'S 
BEING FIXED IS THE TEMP RIL 
LIQUIDITY PROBLEM IN THE 
TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY PROBLEM IN THE 
MARKETS MARKETS AN INVESTIGATION HAS BEGUN INTO 
ALLEGATIONS OF COLLUSION AND PRICE 
FIXING INVOLVING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED 
CONSTRUCTION FIRMS THE COMPANIES 
WHICH INCLUDE BALFOUR BEATTY AND 
CORAL I DON'T KNOW ARE ACCUSED OF 
RIGGING BIDS FOR CONTRACTS SUCH AS 
SCHOOLS UNIVERSITIES AND HOSPITALS 
FORTY FIRMS HAVE ADMITTED TO PRICE 
FIXING ANOTHER THIRTY SEVEN HAVE APPLIED FOR 
LENIENCY FROM THE OFFICE OF FAIR 
TRADING TRADING A GANGMASTER SUPPLYING STAFF TO 
FIRMS HAS HAD HIS LICENCE REVOKED 
AFTER AN INVESTIGATION FOUND 
SHOCKING ABUSE AGAINST WORKERS THE 
GANGMASTERS LICENSING AUTHORITY 
SAID WORKERS AT ELS RECRUITMENT IN 
PETERBOROUGH HAD PAID DEDUCTIONS 
WITHOUT EXPLANATION HAD TO PAY TO 
USE COMPANY TRANSPORT AND WERE ALSO 
TOLD THEY WOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY 
WAGES IF THEY DECIDED TO GO ON 
HOLIDAY SEVEN SAINSBURY'S HAS 
ANNOUNCED PLANS TO HALVE THE NUMBER 
OF DISPOSABLE PLASTIC BAGS USED BY 
CUSTOMERS OVER THE NEXT YEAR THE 
SUPERMARKET CHAIN SAID IT WOULD 
REWARD CUSTOMERS WHO RE USED BAGS 
WITH STORM POINTS THEY SAID FIFTY PER CENT OF 
BAGS WOULD BE MADE OF RECYCLEABLE 
CONTENT BY JUNE THIS YEAR AND ADAM 
WORKING LUNCH EVERY DAY MY SON 
COMES BACK FROM UNIVERSITY NEVER 
TALKS TO MEAL HE GOES STRAIGHT TO 
THE SCREEN TO WAFPL WORKING LUNCH 
AGAIN WILL YOU PLEASE BE LESS 
ENTERTAINING SO MY SON WILL FIND 
TIME TO TALK TO ME AGAIN EVERYONE EVERYONE SHOULD SPEAK TO YOUR MOTHERS 
ON TO OTHER THINGS WITH FEARS THAT 
THE ECONOMY IS HEADING FOR TROUBLE 
THERE ARE CONCERNS AMONGST 
INVESTORS ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD DO 
WITH THEIR MONEY AND WHERE THEY 
SHOULD INVEST IT WHAT USUAL 
SUSPECTS ARE THERE ON THE STOCK 
MARKET THAT MIGHT BEST WEATHER ANY 
FINANCIAL STORM WE'RE HEADING 
TOWARDS HERE ARE SOME OF OUR 
FAVOURITE FACES FROM THE OFFICE 
THEY'RE NOT LOOKING PLEASED THERE 
WITH SOME OF THE COMPANIES IN THEIR 
GRUBBY HANDS THAT IT'S THOUGHT 
MIGHT DO BETTER THAN MOST IN AN 
ECONOMIC 
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN 
LET'S START WITH ANNA YOU COULD 
ARGUE THAT TESCO WOULD BE O. K. 
EVERYONE ALWAYS HAS TO BUY FOOD 
DEMAND SHOULD BE THERE WHATEVER 
HAPPENS TO THE ECONOMY IT HAS 
DEVERSIFIED INTO LOTS OF OTHER 
PRODUCTS LIKE ELECTRICALS AND 
CLOTHES IT HAS A BROAD BASE 
THEREFORE FOR MANY IT'S SEEN AS 
GOOD VALUE L. L. SUPPOSE 
GET'S GET RID OF HER AND TO THIS 
UGLY BLOKE B. P. OIL THE BASIS OF 
WHAT WE NEED NOT ONLY IN PETROL 
BUT ALMOST ALL PRODUCTION PROCESSES 
IF PLASTIC AND EVERYWHERE WHAT'S 
MORE THE PRICE OF OIL HAS BEEN 
RISING DESPITE THESE FEARS OF A 
SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY 
RIGHT GO AWAY THANK YOU BEN 
PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR WELL IT'S A 
USUAL SUSPECT FOR TROUBLED TIMES 
IT OPERATES AROUND THE WORLD AND 
THERE'S GROWING DEMAND FOR IT AND 
IT MIGHT BE WELL PLACED FOR 
TURBULENCE AS WELL 
THERE WE HAVE SIMON WITH VODAFONE 
WELL WE'RE JUST ADDICTED TO MOBILE 
PHONES THEY'RE A WAY OF LIFE 
THAT'S LIKELY TO STAY WITH US 
WHATEVER HAPPENS TO THE ECONOMY 
INTERESTINGLY VODAFONE HAVE BEEN 
INVESTING IN FOREIGN MARKETS IT'S 
NOT RELIANT JUST ON WHAT HAPPENS IN 
THE U. K. THERE ARE FOUR 
POSSIBILITIES FOR YOU 
HERE IS HENK POTTS FROM BARCLAYS 
STOCKBROKERS ON WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN 
A SHARE THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO BEAT 
A A RECESSION 
WE WOULD LIKE LOOK FOR SHARES THAT 
OFFER STRONG STABLE EARNING STREAMS 
WHEN LOOKING AT COMPANIES LIKELY TO 
WEATHER A RECESSION BETTER THAN 
OTHERS YOU DON'T WANT COMPANIES 
VERY MUCH LINKED TO DISCRETIONRY 
SPENDING THEREFORE YOU NEED TO 
LOOK AT AREAS WHERE PEOPLE ARE 
ALMOST FORCED TO CARRY ON SPENDING 
THEREFORE YOU LOOK TOWARDS FOOD 
RETAILERS THE PHARMACEUTICALS ARE 
PERHAPS ANOTHER CLASSIC AREA WHERE 
INVESTORS TEND TO GO DURING TIMES 
OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY OF COURSE 
UTILITIES AND THE TELECOMS OFFER 
GOOD PROTECTION DURING TIMES WHEN 
THE ECONOMY IS LOOKING LIKE IT WILL 
SLOW DOWN 
THE USUAL SUSPECTS I MENTIONED 
SOUND GOOD BUT THERE'S LOTS OF 
REASONS THEY MIGHT NOT DO WELL WE 
ARE EATING BUT COMPETITION IS TOUGH 
IN THE SUPERMARKET SECTOR AND THEIR 
SHARES HAVEN'T DONE WELL THEY'RE 
ALL DOWN OVER THE YEAR IF TIMES 
ARE TOUGH THE N. H. S. WILL BE UNDER 
PRESSURE SO WE WON'T BUY MANY DRUGS 
THAT'S ALSO POINT ONE PUT TO HENK POTTS 
CLEARLY IF YOU'RE LOOKING POTTS FOR A DEFENSIVE SECTOR THERE ARE 
RISKS INVOLVED IN THE INDIVIDUAL 
COMPANIES PEOPLE OFTEN GO TOWARDS 
THE PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR BUT WE 
KNOW THIS IS A SECTOR THAT WILL 
STRUGGLE WITH CHEAP GENERIC 
COMPETITION A WEAK PIPELINE OF NEW 
DRUGS THEY'RE PERHAPS LOOKING AT 
THE FOOD RETAIL SECTOR BELIEVING 
PEOPLE STILL HAVE TO BUY FOOD BUT 
WE KNOW THIS IS A SECTOR THAT IS 
INCREDIBLY COMPETITIVE THERE ARE 
PITFALLS YOU CAN FIND SAFE HAVENS 
AND IDENTIFY SECTORS BUT YOU STILL 
NEED TO LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC 
COMPANY INVOLVED BEFORE MAKING AN 
INVESTMENT INVESTMENT THANKS VERY MUCH IT HAS TO BE SAID 
THAT IT MIGHT BE NONE OF THOSE 
SHARES DO WELL AND WEATHERING 
STORM COULD BE MORE OF AN ISSUE OF 
TRYING TO SPRELD YOUR RISK WITH 
SCREEN SHARES PRORPT BONDS AND 
INDEED THAT VERY OLD FASHIONED 
THING THAT SOME PEOPLE CALLED CASH 
THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S BEEN THREE 
WEEKS SINCE HEATHROW'S TERMINAL FIVE 
OPENED IT'S BEEN BLIGHTED BY 
PROBLEMS INCLUDING A DISASTROUS 
BAGGAGE HANDLING PROCESS IT'S BEEN 
SO BAD THAT SOME INSURANCE 
COMPANIES ARE REFUSING TO PROVIDE 
LOST LUGGAGE COVER FOR PASSENGERS 
FLYING OUT OR INTO TERMINAL FIVE ONE 
OF OUR VIEWERS FLEW FROM TERMINAL FIVE 
ON OPENING DAY SHE'S BEEN SO SAN 
FRANCISCO AND BACK BUT WHO KNOWS 
WHERE HER BAG IS 
RACHEL HAS BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT 
FOR OUR VIEWER LOUISE IT WAS LESS 
OF A MAIDEN VOYAGE MORE OF AN 
UNMITIGATED DISASTER 
IT'S THREE 
WEEKS TODAY SINCE I LAST SAW MY 
LUGGAGE THE WAY THAT IT HAS BEEN 
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ANY SENSE OR 
SPEAK TO SOMEBODY WHO APPEARS TO 
KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IT'S BEEN 
EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THE 
WEBSITE IS VERY CONFUSING AND THE 
INFORMATION THAT IS PUT ON THERE IS 
OFTEN ERRONEOUS 
WHEN YOU DO GET TO SPEAK TO 
SOMEBODY ON THE TELEPHONE WHEN I 
ACTUALLY SPOKE TO SOMEBODY IN 
FLORIDA I WAS IN SAN FRANCISCO 
REMEMBER THEY WERE JUST LOOKING 
AT THE SAME WEBSITE THAT I HAD BEEN 
LOOKING AT SO REALLY I DIDN'T 
FEEL THAT SHE KNEW ANYTHING MORE 
THAN I DID 
IT'S THE FRUSTRATION I THINK 
AND NOBODY DOES IT BETTER 
LOUISE'S WAS ONE OF 
MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND BAGS MISLACED BY 
BRITISH AIRWAYS AS THEY CANCELLED 
FLIGHTS AND STRUGGLED TO COPE WITH 
THE OPENING OF TERMINAL FIVE TODAY B. A. 
TOLD US 
INCLUDING LOUISE'S WHICH THEY 
ESTIMATE SHOULD HAVE ARRIVED BY 
YESTERDAY EVENING UNFORTUNATELY 
LOUISE TELLS US HER BELOVED 
LUGGAGE IS STILL NOWHERE TOB SEEN 
RACHEL SOME INSURERS REFUSING TO 
ENSURE 
THAT'S RIGHT A HANDFUL OF ENSURE SHARES INCLUDING TESCO DIRECT 
LINE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND AND 
CHURCHILL SAID ANY NEW POLICIES 
WON'T COVER PASSENGERS FOR LOST OR 
DELAYED BAGGAGE OR EVEN IN SOME 
CASES DELAYED OR CANCELLED FLIGHTS 
IF THEY'RE FLYING IN OR OUT OF 
TERMINAL FIVE THIS ISN'T GOING TO 
AFFECT ANYONE WHO TOOK OUT A POLICY 
BEFORE THE TERMINAL FIVE PROBLEM 
STARTED IT'S NOT NECESSARILY 
PERMANENT DIRECT LINE SAID AS SOON 
AS TERMINAL FIVE IS WORKING PROPERLY 
THEY'LL REINSTATE THAT COVER ONE ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES IS THAT IT'S NOT 
UNUSUAL TO LOSE YOUR BAGS SO IS IT 
WORTH TAKING OUT INSURANCE AT ALL 
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S FRUSTRATING 
LOSING YOUR BAGS OR HAVING YOUR 
FLIGHT DELAYED IS COMMON BUT WE 
ARE WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT 
PASSENGERS IN OR OUT OF TERMINAL FIVE 
AND ONLY LIMITED NUMBER OF 
COMPANIES NO LONGER PROVIDING THAT 
COVER IF YOU ARE THINKING OF NOT 
TAKING OUT INSURANCE INSURANCE 
DOESN'T JUST COVER YOU FOR WHAT 
HAPPENS TO YOUR BAGS OR FLIGHT 
QUITE OFTEN YOU'LL END UP CLAIMING 
FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES MAYBE YOU'RE 
A VICTIM OF THEFT MAYBE YOU NEED 
TO CANCEL YOUR FLIGHT IT'S ALWAYS 
WORTH THINKING ABOUT WORTH TAKING 
OUT IF YOU'RE GOING ON HOLIDAY 
EARLIER I SPOKE TO THE ASSOCIATION 
OF BRITISH INSURERS THEY SAID THE 
SITUATION AT TERMINAL FIVE IS 
IMPROVING AND THEY EXPECT THAT 
POLICY TO BE REINSTATED BY THOSE 
PROVIDERS FAIRLY SOON 
IF YOU LOSE 
YOUR BAG LET'S GET PRACTICAL WHAT 
DO YOU DO 
ACCORDING TO THE 
ASSOCIATION OF BRITISH INSURERS 
THEY SAY IF YOU LOSE YOUR BAG AND 
HAVE INSURANCE COVER THE FIRST 
THING YOU DO IS PHONE YOUR 
INSURANCE COMPANY 
IF YOUR BAGS GO MISSING YOUR FIRST 
POINT OF CALL SHOULD BE TO TALK TO 
YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY MOST HAVE 
TWENTY FOUR HOUR HELPLINES SO YOU CAN GET IN 
CONTACT WITH THEM MOST TRAVEL 
COMPANIES WILL PAY AN AMOUNT SO YOU 
CAN GO OUT AND BUY TEMPORARY 
PROVISION FOR EXAMPLE EMERGENCY 
CLOTHES AND TOOTHPASTE UP TO 
MONETARY AMOUNT IN THE POLICY SO SO KEEP A COPY OF YOUR POLICY IN YOUR 
HAND BAGGAGE 
IF YOU DON'T HAVE COVER FOR YOUR 
BAGS WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE 
CHOSEN NOT TO TAKE IT OR YOU HAVE 
ONE OF THOSE POLICIES THAT WON'T 
COVER YOU FROM TERMINAL FIVE YOU ARE 
COVERED BY SOMETHING CALLED THE 
MONTREAL CONVENTION THAT HOLDS 
AIRLINES LIABLE FOR PROBLEMS WITH 
BAGS AND PROBLEMS WITH FLIGHTS IT 
COVERS YOU FOR A LOST BAG UP TO 
ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED PER PASSENGER IT 
APPLIES FOR INTERNATIONAL TRIPS 
AND BETWEEN E. U. MEMBER STATES TO 
GET ACCESS TO THAT YOU APPLY 
DIRECTLY TO THE AIRLINE AND YOU'LL 
GET MORE ON THAT ON THIS WEBSITE 
ANY ADVICE PRE CLAIMING INSURANCE 
IN OTHER WORDS ANY PRACTICAL ADVICE 
TO TRY TO STOP HAVING TO CLAIM FOR 
A. W. O. L. LUGGAGE 
YES THE IDEAL THING 
WOULD BE FOR YOUR BAG NOT TO GO 
MISSING I ASKED VETERAN TRAVEL 
EVERY SIMON CALDER WHAT WE CAN DO 
FIRST IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE 
SOMETHING DON'T CHECK IT IN 
LUCKILY THESE DAYS ON MANY AIRLINES 
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO CARRY ONE CHUNKY 
PIECE OF HAND LUGGAGE AND ALSO A 
LAPTOP OR HANDBAG IT MEANS THAT ON 
A WEEKEND TRIP OR BUSINESS TRIP YOU 
CAN RRY EVERYTHING YOU NEED INTO 
THE AIRCRAFT CABIN NEXT IF YOU 
HAVE TO CHECK STUFF IN TRY TO GET A 
DIRECT FLIGHT IF YOU'RE CHANGING 
PLANES AT SOMEWHERE LIKE HEATHROW 
AMSTERDAM PARIS OR FRANKFURT 
THAT'S WHEN THE CHANCES ARE HIGHEST 
THAT YOUR BAG WILL GO ASTRAY 
FINALLY ASSUME THAT EVERY SINGLE 
TAG WILL BE TORN OFF THE OUTSIDE OF 
YOUR BAG AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE 
LABEL WITH YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS 
CLEARLY MARKED STUCK AT THE INSIDE 
OF THE BAG THAT MEANS IF YOUR BAG 
DOES GO OFF ON ITS OWN LITTLE 
HOLIDAY THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE IT 
WILL FINALLY MAKE ITS WAY BACK TO 
YOU 
OUR VIEWER LOUISE DOES HAVE YOU TRAVEL INSURANCE SHE STARTED HER 
CLAIM SHE'S WAITING ON ONE PIECE 
OF PAPERWORK FROM BRITISH AIRWAYS 
WHICH HOPEFULLY FOR HER WILL ARRIVE 
FAIRLY SOON MAYBE EVEN WITH HER 
BAG THANK YOU 
STKPWHRE THAT'S ALL FROM US TODAY 
ADAM AND PADDY ARE BACK TOMORROW 
I'M BACK ON MONDAY SEND US YOUR 
MORTGAGE QUESTIONS FOR TOMORROW
