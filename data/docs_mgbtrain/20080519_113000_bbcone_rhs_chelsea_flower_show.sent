WITH YOUR SIXTY THIRD MEDAL OF THE FINGERS FINGERS CROSSED CROSSED THE SCALE OF THE GREAT PAVILLION IS 
STAGGERING SOME OF THE MOST 
POPULAR EXHIBITS AT CHELSEA ARE THE 
SMALL GUARD NDS WHICH OFTEN 
INSPIRE GREAT IDEAS TO TAKE HOME 
ESPECIALLY IF LIKE ME GARDENING IS 
A HOBBY RATHER THAN PROFESSION 
THERE ARE TWENTY TWO SMALL GARDENS AT 
CHELSEA THIS YEAR THEY'RE DIVIDED 
INTO TWO CATEGORIES URBAN AND 
COURT YARD ANDY WENT ON A MINI 
MISSION TO PROVE SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL THE COURT YARD GARDENS ARE TUCKED

WILLOWS REMIND US OF THE MUCH LOVED 
STORY 
I'VE RECENTLY MOVED HOUSE I'M 
LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A GARDEN 
THOUGH IT'S A VERY SMALL GUARD 
WHAT CAN I TAKE FROM SOME OF THOSE 
THAT WE'VE SEEN THE SMALL GARDEN 
IS A IMPORTANT INGREDIENT OF 
CHELSEA PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO THEM 
SO EASILY YOU CAN TAKE LOTS OF 
THINGS FROM THEM MIGHT BE THE 
MATERIALS THEY USE THE WALL FINISH 
COULD BE EVEN THE COMBINATION OF 
PLANTS THERE'S A LOT THERE 
FOR ME 
THEY'RE MORE REALISTIC THOUGH THEY 
PUSH THE BOUNDARIES I CAN IMAGINE 
SOME OF THOSE IN AN IDEAL WORLD 
BEING TRANSPORTED HOME 
THE OTHER 
THING ABOUT SOME OF THEM IS THEY 
HAVEN'T GOT HUGE BUDGETS THEY'VE 
HAD TO BE INNOVATIVE WITH THE MONEY 
THEY'VE GOT THAT ALSO MAKES IT 
MUCH MORE REALISTIC FOR MOST PEOPLE 
WE ALL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE 
PURSE STRINGS IT'S PRESS DAY AT 
CHELSEA THE DAY WHEN THE WORLD'S 
MEDIA DESKRENDS ON THE SHOW HOPE 
TO SCHOOL HORTICULTURAL HEADLINES 
IT MUST BE ONE OF THE FEW DAYS WHEN 
THE CELEBRITIES TAKE SECOND PLACE 
TO THE PLANTS L. BRAVED THE THRONG TO FIND OUT WHY CHELSEA PUTS ALL OTHER SHOWS IN THE SHADE
