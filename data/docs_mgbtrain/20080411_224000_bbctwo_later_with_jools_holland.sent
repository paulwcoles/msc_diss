GLEN MARKETA WELCOME TO THE SHOW AND NOW 
FIRST OF ALL I HAVE TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS 
BECAUSE YOU'VE ACTUALLY WON AN OSCAR FOR YOUR LOVELY SONG IN THE FILM ONCE 
WHAT WAS WINNING AN OSCAR LIKE YOU PLAYED THERE 
IT WAS A BIT LIKE BEING A PLUMBER AT A FLOWER SHOW 
IT WAS WE KIND OF FELT TOTALLY OUT IT WAS WEIRD FOR US 
BECAUSE WE MADE THIS FILM IN DUBLIN TWO YEARS AGO IN JANUARY ON TWO HANDYCAMS 
AND IT WAS JUST COMPLETELY THE ANTITHESIS OF EVERYTHING THAT'S KINDA HOLLYWOOD 
AND THEN FOR IT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY THE AMERICANS 
WAS KIND OF A SHOCK FOR US 
WELL HOW WAS IT THERE 
ERM WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO 
WAS TO GO RIGHT IT'S A ROOM FULL OF ABOUT THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE IT'S A GIG 
JUST PLAY THE SONG 
BUT THEN YOU'RE CONSTANTLY REMINDED OF THE WEIGHT AND SIZE OF THE THING 
I MEAN IT'S HUGE 
THERE'S A TOTAL BLANK IN MY EVENING WHEN JOHN TRAVOLTA CAME ON STAGE AND WAS LIKE YOU KNOW 
FOR BEST SONG THE OSCAR GOES TO 
AND I DON'T REMEMBER FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS THERE'S A TOTAL HOLE IN MY NIGHT 
WHERE I GOT UP ON STAGE AND SAID SOMETHING BUT I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT 
DO YOU HAVE ANY MEMORY OF IT OR HAVE YOU WIPED IT IT WAS SO TRAUMATIC 
WELL NO ACTUALLY I KEPT WAITING TO GET NERVOUS AND MY NERVES JUST DIDN'T HIT COS I WAS SO 
I WAS SO FULL OF JOY TO BE THERE AND TO PLAY FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE I WAS JUST REALLY EXCITED 
YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS THE BUILD UP 
THE WHOLE BUILD UP TO THE THING WAS LIKE MONTHS OF YOU'RE PLAYING NO PRESSURE 
YOU'RE PLAYING IN FRONT OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST STARS 
AND AN AUDIENCE OF MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD NO PRESSURE EXACTLY 
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE FILM WHICH YOU'RE BOTH IN 
THANKS

I SEE YOU EVERY DAY 
DURING THE DAY PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR SONGS THEY KNOW JUST 
SONGS THEY RECOGNISE I WOULDN'T MAKE MONEY SO I PLAY THESE AT NIGHT
