WELCOME TO B. B. C. SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
TONIGHT WE FEATURE MAD ABOUT MUSIC 
AN INSPIRATIONAL INTRODUCTION TO THE WORLD OF MUSIC 
ENABLING STUDENTS TO EXPERIENCE A RANGE OF STYLES AND IDEAS FROM INDIAN RHYTHMS TO JAPANESE SCALES 
THESE LIVELY DOCUMENTARY STYLE PROGRAMMES WILL ENCOURAGE STUDENTS 
TO EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT STYLES AND WAYS OF MAKING MUSIC 
WE ALL LIKE HEAVY HARD ROCK THAT'S THE MAIN BASIC OF THE MUSIC 
BUT HIP HOP AND ALL THESE KIND OF MUSICS THAT ARE OUT THERE WE LISTEN TO 
YOU JUST KINDA WANNA THROW IT INTO YOUR MUSIC TOO 
LET'S GO 
WHEN WE WRITE SONGS WE START WITH A RIFF WITH A DRUMBEAT WITH SOMETHING 
AND THEN WE JUST BUILD ON IT PEOPLE KEEP ADDING THEIR TWO CENTS THROWING THEIR IDEAS IN 
WE GOT ONE GUITAR DOING ONE THING THE BASS DOING ANOTHER HORNS ON TOP THAT'S WHAT GIVES IT A FUSION 
BOOP D. A. BOOP BOOP BOOP 
YOU GOT A POP SONG AND A BIOHAZARD TYPE HEAVY RIFF IN THE MIDDLE 
SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T EVEN HEAR THE BOTTOM SAX BECAUSE YOU'RE SO INTO 
WE'VE NO BOUNDARIES SO WHY SHOULD WE WE CAN ADD A HORN COS NO ONE CARES 
YEAH YEAH YEAH LOOKY HERE WHAT I GOT FOR YOU 
I CAN HEAR YOU INSIDE SCREAMING 
FEED ME THE JUICE 
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT FOR YOU TO DO 
I GOTTA GET LOST CAN'T BE SORRY 
IF THESE ARE GOOD TIMES YEAH 
IF THESE ARE GOOD TI I. IMES 
THE WORDS REALLY NEVER COME FIRST IT'S ALWAYS MUSIC 
WE FEED OFF THE MUSICAL IDEA AND THEN DEVELOP WORDS AROUND THAT 
WE GET THE INFLUENCE FOR THE SONG THROUGH THE GUITARS BASS DRUMS WHATEVER'S COMING OUT 
SOME BANDS MIGHT HAVE A SONGWRITER WHO SAYS THIS IS THE WORDS AND EVERYONE ELSE LEARNS IT 
BUT WHEN WE WRITE SONGS IT'S LIKE SEVEN PEOPLE IT'S A FIGHT THIS IS MY PART 
TAKE THAT OUT PUT THIS IN 
HEY MAN GOT SOME SPARE CHANGE FOR ME BROTHER ALL I NEED'S A LITTLE SOMETHING 
YOU SEE ME SITTING HERE FACE TO THE GUTTER YOU PASS ME BY YOU RIDE UP HIGH 
THE LAST ONE DEAD IS A ROTTEN EGG 
MAY BE BETTER OFF OUT OF IT 
IF THESE ARE GOOD TIMES 
YEAH 
IF THESE ARE GOOD TI I. IMES 
THEY MAKE ME WANNA 
WE'RE NOT QUEUEING UP FOR THE BUS LET'S GO 
GOOD TIMES 
IF THESE ARE GOOD TIMES YEAH 
GOOD TIMES 
IF THESE ARE GOOD TIMES 
COME ON COME ON NOW 
ALL WE KNOW WE KNOW YEAH WE KNOW 
ALL WE KNOW WE KNOW YEAH WE KNOW 
ALL WE KNOW WE KNOW YEAH WE KNOW 
MICHEAL HAS BEEN COMPOSING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WE WERE PREPARING TO DO A CONCERT 
AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD DO A COMBINED PIECE I WOULD WORK ON THE RHYTHM 
AND MICHEAL ON THE MELODY 
IT STARTED WITH A TABLA COMPOSITION WHICH IS A COMPOSITION IN ITSELF 
THAT OPENING RHYTHM WAS THE KEY TO IT D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. 
AND I WANTED SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE 
AND FROM THAT LITTLE MOTIF ALL OF THE REST OF THE MUSIC IN FACT CAME 
WITH CRISPY THERE ARE LAYERS 
IT IS A KIND OF FUSION BUT THE LAYERS ARE INTERACTING ALL THE TIME 
YOU HAVE THAT RHYTHMIC LAYER FIRST OF ALL THEN YOU HAVE THE LAYER OF PICTURES 
BY PICTURES I MEAN THERE'S INDIVIDUAL NOTES 
AND THE HARMONIES THAT GO WITH THEM 
AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT AGAIN MORE RECENTLY KEN EDGE THE SAX PLAYER HAS BEEN COMING IN 
AND WE'VE INVITED HIM JUST TO IMPROVISE FREELY OVER THOSE 
SO YOU GET A THIRD LAYER WHICH IS NOT NOTATED IT'S IMPROVISED JAZZ 
IN THE MIDDLE SECTIONS I FOUND THAT IN FOLLOWING THE RHYTHMS I NEEDED A CHORD SEQUENCE 
SO I SIMPLY PICKED A STOCK CHORD SEQUENCE SOMETHING LIKE YOU'D FIND IN VIVALDI 
AND THAT SORT OF APPEARED 
I THINK OF CRISPY AS A MEETING OF MUSICAL PERSONALITIES 
UM ME ON THE ONE HAND AS A DRUMMER 
MICHEAL AS A COMPOSER AND A PLAYER OF IRISH MUSIC 
THE ORCHESTRA FROM A CLASSICAL BACKGROUND KEN WITH IMPROVISATORY SKILLS ON THE SAXOPHONE 
SO I SUPPOSE A COMBINATION OF ALL THOSE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF FUSION IN MUSIC 
I LIKE TO COMPOSE PIECES WHICH NOT SO MUCH USE TRADITIONAL MUSIC BUT USE TRADITIONAL MUSICIANS 
BECAUSE THEY BRING WITH THEM ALL OF THE ORNAMENTATION AND THE VARIATION 
AND ALL OF THE STYLE OF THE THINGS THAT TRADITIONAL MUSICIANS DO 
THE SOUND OF THE FLUTE FOR EXAMPLE THE VERY SOUND YOU GET OUT OF IT 
WHAT I HAD IN MIND FOR TODAY WAS JUST TO TRY OUT A FEW THINGS 
AND SEE HOW THEY WORK WITH BOTH YOUR VOICES TOGETHER 
HERE'S THE CHORDS 
HAVE YOU GOT SOME LYRICS THAT WE COULD TRY YEAH 
I LOOK TO HORIZONS FOR A STRAIGHT AND EVEN PLAN SEARCHING FOR TOMORROWS LURKING INSIDE THE SHADOW'S HAND 
IF YOU WANNA TRY ANY OF THOSE OVER THIS CHORD SHAPE 
WHAT I TRIED TO ACHIEVE IN THIS PIECE IS ACTUALLY TO FUSE TWO DIFFERENT STYLES 
TO BRING IN DENYSE'S COMMERCIAL AND WESTERN TYPE OF SINGING 
AND MIX THAT WITH JAYANTE BOSE'S MORE CLASSICAL STYLE FROM INDIA 
YOU KNOW YOU COULD KEEP THIS AS A COMMON TONE 
TRY IT WITH YOU COMING IN YEAH 
THAT'S IT 
HEAR THE VOICE AS IT REACHES TO YOU 
WHEN SHE SAYS HEAR THE VOICE IT WORKS NICELY WITH YOU I DON'T WANT TO SING AS MANY NOTES 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE GOOD AND THEN MAYBE WE COULD GO INTO THE BEGINNING OF THE WHOLE THING 
TRY THREE BEATS 
YEAH MORE LIKE THAT 
IN ADDITION TO THESE THINGS IN THE STUDIO I'LL BE ADDING IN THINGS LIKE FLUTE 
AND SEQUENCE PARTS LIKE THE DRUMS AND BASS AND SO ON 
THESE ARE ALL THE DRUM SOUNDS 
THE BASS AND A FANTASY PAD SOUND 
GO STRAIGHT INTO THE OTHER BIT 
THAT'S ONE YEAH AND TWO IS 
YEAH 
OH OH RIGHT JUST GLISSANDO 
THAT'S IT AS SIMPLE AS THAT AND AS SHORT AS THAT 
TRY EVEN VOCALS 
I'M THINKING LIKE VOICES AND VOCAL SOUNDS IT COULD BE QUITE EFFECTIVE 
DHUM DHUM DHUM DHUM DHUM 
YEAH GO FOR IT ALL RIGHT 
HEAR THE VOICES 
SOME OF THE RHYTHMS ARE AFRICAN RHYTHMS I LEARNED FROM GUYANA 
I'M GONNA LOOK TO HORIZONS 
FOR THAT SAFE AND EVEN PLAN 
SEARCHING FOR TOMORROWS 
LURKING INSIDE THE SHADOW'S HAND 
HEAR THE VOICE THAT REACHES TO YOU 
OH EASE THAT WORRIED MIND 
HEAR THE VOICE THAT REACHES TO YOU 
YOU'RE NOT THE WORRYING KIND 
THINKING OF A FANTASY 
THAT REACHES SO FAR AND WIDE 
FREE AS THE WIND BLOWS 
YOU HAVE NOTHING 
NOTHING TO HIDE 
YEAH 
HEAR THE VOICE THAT REACHES TO YOU 
OH EASE THAT WORRIED MIND 
HEAR THE VOICE THAT REACHES TO YOU 
YOU'RE NOT THE WORRYING KIND 
HEAR THE VOICE THAT REACHES TO YOU 
OH EASE YOUR WORRIES 
EASE YOUR WORRIED MIND YEAH 
LET IT EASE LET IT EASE LET IT EASE 
OH OH 
HEAR THE VOICE 
HEAR THE VOICE 
HEAR THE VOICE 
YEP I'VE FINISHED 
NICE ONE O. K. YEAH COOL 
DAVE FINDS HIS INSPIRATION IN FAIRLY MUNDANE THINGS 
THINGS LIKE WHEN HE'S WASHING HIS TRACKSUIT BOTTOMS OR WHEN HE HEARS SOMETHING IN THE STREET 
THAT SEEMS TO EXCITE HIM AND THEY FIND THEIR WAY INTO HIS MUSIC 
I WAS ASKED TO DO A PIECE CALLED WATER 
COMBINING THE SOUND OF RUNNING WATER AND THE STRING ORCHESTRA 
I WAS TRYING TO GET IT TO SOUND LIKE 
THAT 
BUT IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO SUSS OUT HOW TO DO IT 
AND EVENTUALLY I SUSSED OUT THAT IF YOU PUT A TRACKSUIT INTO WATER AND LIFT THEM OUT 
YOU GET A MUCH BETTER SOUND THAN A TOILET 
ON TOP OF THAT DRIPPING WATER SOUND 
THAT DAVE DISCOVERED HE'S GIVEN ME THIS LONG VIOLIN SOLO 
IT'S QUITE REPETITIVE 
IT HAS THESE ARPEGGIOS WHICH ARE SCALES THAT GO UP AND DOWN 
THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED IT 
IT WASN'T SOUNDING QUITE HOW DAVID IMAGINED IT 
HE ASKED ME TO VISUALISE MYSELF JUST SITTING BY A WATERFALL AND THAT WOULD BE THE TRICKLING SOUND 
HE SAID I SHOULD FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS MAKING UP THE NOTES AND DISCOVERING THEM AS I WENT ALONG 
VOODOO CHILE BY JIMI HENDRIX 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT HENDRIX IS THAT HE COULD MAKE VERY UGLY SOUNDS INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL 
THE WAY HE PLAYED WAS VERY EXTREME 
HE WASN'T AT ALL FRIGHTENED OF MAKING ANY SOUND THAT COULD BE EXPRESSIVE 
WHEN I WROTE THIS PIECE GORBACHEV I USED VERY MUCH HENDRIX INFLUENCED GUITAR PLAYING ON THE SOLO CELLO 
I GOT TOGETHER WITH THE CELLIST MELISSA PHELPS 
AND WE FOUND THE BEST WAY OF GETTING THE EFFECTS I WAS TRYING TO GET 
THAT'S A BIT TOO DISGUSTING SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THE TWO 
I GET IT SOUNDING TOO STRAIGHT OR TOO WILD 
IT'S TO SOUND BEAUTIFUL AND UGLY WHICH IS WHAT HENDRIX USED TO DO 
SOMBRE CELLO 
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GET ANY SOUND 
THAT'S GREAT THAT'S THE WAY THE CELLO SHOULD SOUND 
CLASSICAL PLAYERS ARE TAUGHT ALL THE TIME TO MAKE A BEAUTIFUL SOUND 
THEN I COME ALONG AND SAY CAN YOU MAKE THE MOST UGLY SOUND SOME PEOPLE FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT 
BUT MELISSA MAKES IT SOUND WORSE THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE 
IT'S NOT THAT IT'S UGLY YOU JUST GET MORE OVERTONES 
IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WAY OF USING THE INSTRUMENT AND IT'S NOT A SINGING CELLO SOUND 
LAST YEAR A FRIEND CALLED KATHY RUSSELL DIED OF LEUKAEMIA 
I WANTED TO WRITE A PIECE FOR HER AND TWO DIFFERING IDEAS CAME TO ME 
THAT SORT OF INSPIRED THE PIECE 
THE FIRST THING THAT CAME TO MIND WAS THAT MY SON TY WAS PLAYING WITH A WIND PIPE IN THE GARDEN 
IT SOUNDED BEAUTIFUL BUT HAUNTING IT SOUNDS LIKE THE LAST POST ON THE TRUMPET IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS 
AND THEN IT SOUNDS VERY HEAVENLY BECAUSE THE VIOLINS COME IN VERY VERY HIGH THEY'RE RIGHT UP HERE 
HIGH SOLEMN NOTE AND THEY GO ON 
IT ALL SOUNDS VERY REMOTE AND VERY FREE AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL 
AND THEN IT MOVES INTO THE CELLO SOLO WHICH IS THE CROCODILE SONG 
BEFORE KATHY DIED SHE HAD SUNG TY THE CROCODILE SONG FROM PETER PAN 
BECAUSE TY HAD BROUGHT IN HIS PLASTIC CROCODILE AT THAT TIME HE WOULDN'T GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT HIS CROCODILE 
AND THAT GOES LIKE THIS 
AFTER SHE HAD DIED THAT SONG REALLY HAUNTED ME AND I KEPT THINKING ABOUT IT 
NEVER SMILE AT A CROCODILE 
NO YOU CAN'T GET FRIENDLY WITH A CROCODILE 
I WANTED TO MAKE IT A LOT SADDER SO I PUT IT IN THE MINOR 
AND A LOT SLOWER 
THEN HE TAKES THAT SOLO IN TO THE VIOLIN IT'S VERY INTERESTING 
BECAUSE IT'S STILL THE CROCODILE SONG BUT IT'S GOT OTHER INFLUENCES 
DAVE'S GOT INTO SCOTTISH MUSIC SINCE HE MOVED TO SCOTLAND AND HE'S LISTENED TO A LOT OF FIDDLE MUSIC 
AND HE'S USED SOME OF THEIR TECHNIQUES HE USES A THING CALLED SCOTCH SNAPS WHERE I GO 
IT'S JUST REALLY EXPRESSIVE REALLY BEAUTIFUL 
THE EXCITING THING ABOUT DAVE'S WRITING ESPECIALLY FOR STRINGS 
IS THAT HE'S PUSHED BACK BOUNDARIES OF THE SOUNDS THAT WE CAN MAKE 
I DON'T KNOW MANY COMPOSERS WHO WANT US TO MAKE SOUNDS LIKE THIS 
BUT DAVE REALLY INSISTS ON IT IT'S GOT TO BE HARD AND AGGRESSIVE 
GIVE IT EVEN MORE STICK GO RIGHT UP TO THE BRIDGE 
I WAS ON A TRAIN ONE NIGHT SITTING OPPOSITE THIS IRISH GUY WHO WAS DRUNK TRYING TO PLAY THE VIOLIN 
HE WAS GOING UP TO THE BRIDGE AND EVERYONE WAS TELLING HIM TO SHUT UP 
BUT WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT TO HAVE A WHOLE ORCHESTRA MAKING THAT SOUND 
WHEN DAVE GAVE US THE MUSIC FOR FREE THE SPIRIT 
HE SAID THAT THE BEGINNING SHOULD BE VIOLENT AND THEN WE HAVE THIS BIT WHERE IT GETS FASTER AND FASTER 
IT SOUNDS LIKE A TRAIN CHUGGING ACTUALLY BUILDING UP SOME SPEED 
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY HEARD THE SOUND BEFORE ON THE FLUTE 
IT'S THE ALTO FLUTE SO IT'S GOT A MORE RESONANT SOUND 
HE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THOSE SOUTH AMERICAN PAN PIPES HE JUST BLOWS INCREDIBLY HARD 
YOU DON'T GET A REAL NOTE BUT YOU GET HARMONICS 
AND LOTS OF SPIT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SOUND A SORT OF TUH SOUND 
I WAS PLAYING IN A FILM AND THERE WAS AN AFRICAN TUNE WHICH WE'LL PLAY THAT I DEVELOPED INTO MY THING 
THAT WAS THE STARTING POINT AND I ENDED UP DOING THAT RHYTHM ON ONE NOTE SO I WAS GOING 
AND I TURNED IT INTO 
ON THIS ALTO FLUTE IF YOU GO DOWN TO THE BOTTOM NOTE AND GIVE IT A LOT OF STICK AND STILL DO THAT RHYTHM 
YOU END UP WITH SOMETHING QUITE EXTRAORDINARY 
THAT BECAME THE MAIN THEME OF THIS PIECE CALLED FREE THE SPIRIT 
IT'S VERY EXCITING TO PLAY IT'S VERY SHORT WHICH IS QUITE NICE 
BECAUSE YOU FEEL YOU GET A HUGE AMOUNT IT'S LIKE AN EXPLOSION 
YOU GET THIS HUGE AMOUNT OF SOUND AND EXPERIMENTING WITH SOUNDS BUT IT'S ALL OVER IN ABOUT A MINUTE 
I DON'T REALLY LIKE DISCUSSING MUSIC 
BECAUSE THE MUSIC SPEAKS TO YOU OR NOT I CAN GIVE INTELLECTUAL TWADDLE ABOUT THIS THAT OR THE OTHER 
BUT IF IT DOESN'T MOVE THE PERSON IT'S NOT REALLY WORTH ALL THE EFFORT 
AND SO ALL MY FAVOURITE MUSICIANS ARE PEOPLE THAT WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THEM SOUND VERY EMOTIONAL 
WHETHER IT'S JOHN COLTRANE MOZART OR MILES DAVIS THEY SPEAK TO YOU THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH IT 
WITH CELTIC AIR I WANTED TO WRITE A PIECE FOR KATHY'S MEMORIAL SERVICE 
AND I HOPE THAT IF SHE HAD HEARD IT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT IT WAS A FITTING TRIBUTE 
I'D LIKE YOU TO HEAR THE FINAL SECTION WHICH IS THE MOST EMOTIONAL PART AND I HOPE IT GETS TO YOU 
I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM JOSS ONE DAY SAYING SHE NEEDED A SINGER THAT COULD SOUND LIKE AN ALIEN 
AS SHE HAD THIS IDEA FOR AN OPERA 
DID YOU MEAN TO DO THE HAPPEN INSTEAD OF HAPPEN TO 
YOU DID HAPP EN 
THE INSPIRATION FOR THIS OPERA CAME FROM AN ACCOUNT I READ 
OF A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO WAS APPARENTLY ABDUCTED BY ALIENS' 
ONE THING THEY DID WAS WARN HER ABOUT THE POSSIBLE END OF THE WORLD 
THE POSSIBLE DESTRUCTION OF OUR PLANET TERRIBLE THINGS WOULD HAPPEN TO THE EARTH 
CITIES WOULD CRUMBLE MOUNTAINS WOULD FALL THE SUN WOULD TURN BLACK 
AND THOSE ARE THE WORDS THAT I SING IN THE OPERA 
WE RECORDED THEM FORWARDS AND THEN TURNED THE TAPE ROUND 
TERRIBLE THINGS 
WILL HAPPEN TO THE EARTH 
IT WILL BLOW UP 
CITIES WILL CRUMBLE 
AND THEN WE JUST TURN IT OVER HERE 
IT WAS A BIT EXTREME WASN'T IT THAT LAST SWOOP 
IT WILL BLOW UP 
WE WERE LOOKING FOR A WAY OF CONVEYING AN ALIEN LANGUAGE 
WE TRIED ALL SORTS OF STRANGE WAYS OF SINGING 
AND IT SEEMED THAT THE BACKWARDS SINGING WAS THE MOST APPROPRIATE 
THIS PECULIAR LANGUAGE AND PECULIAR RHYTHM 
SOUNDS O. K. IT'S GOT SOMETHING 
YOU FEEL AS IF YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE IT'S STILL ENGLISH JUST BACKWARDS 
SO THAT MAKES IT PARTICULARLY STRANGE 
ALSO I THINK THE ALIEN'S NOT NECESSARILY AN UNFRIENDLY CHARACTER 
ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS REALLY STRANGE WHEN IT ENTERS STEELY AND COLD 
BUT THE SINGING IS ALMOST A CONTRAST TO THAT IT'S QUITE SOFT AND PLEADING IN A WAY 
PLEADING WITH THIS PERSON TO LOOK AT THESE TERRIBLE THINGS AND TO BEWARE 
AND TO WARN OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO THE EARTH 
CITIES WILL CRUMBLE 
YEP TRY THAT 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS QUITE NICE IT SOUNDS TO ME A TINY BIT FLAT AGAIN 
IT'S ONLY ON ONE D. A. D. A. 
WHAT APPARENTLY OFTEN HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE ARE VISITED BY ALIENS IS THEY GET INTO A TRANCE STATE 
OR A HYPNOTIC STATE 
WHICH IS WHAT WE WANTED TO CONVEY WITH MIKE 
MIKE IN THE OPERA IS FAIRLY TRAUMATISED BY THE VISIT OF THIS ALIEN 
HE'S ALSO IN A KIND OF TRANCE LIKE STATE AND HIS SINGING REFLECTS THIS 
SUDDENLY HE'S ABLE TO SING BACKWARDS 
AND HE'S REPEATING ONE OF THE WORDS THAT MELANIE SINGS FULLBARREH WHICH MEANS TERRIBLE THINGS 
IN THE MUSIC THERE'S A VERY LILTING QUALITY IN THE STRINGS 
THAT'S VERY REPETITIVE AND IT'S GOING ON THE WHOLE TIME 
AGAIN IT HAS A MESMERIC TRANCE LIKE QUALITY TO IT WHICH IS UNDERLINING THE WHOLE THING 
THE VERY END OF THE PIECE GOES INTO AN IMPROVISATION 
AGAIN WE WANTED TO FIND A SORT OF UNUSUAL QUALITY 
I SUPPOSE I TRIED TO IMAGINE WHAT AN ALIEN WOULD SOUND LIKE 
IF IT WAS TALKING TO ITSELF OR JUST CHATTERING 
I THINK I JUST I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER ACTUALLY 
I JUST DID SOME VERY HIGH 
THAT SORT OF THING LITTLE SNIPPETS MM LIKE AN EASTERN EUROPEAN ALIEN 
T. V. ON 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOND OF GANGSTER FILMS 
AND IT'S A FONDNESS I'VE SHARED WITH THE FEATHERSTONEHAUGHS 
WHO ARE MY DANCERS FOR THIS PROJECT 
WE DO GO AND SEE A LOT OF GANGSTER FILMS TOGETHER 
AND I MEAN OLD BLACK AND WHITE EDWARD G. ROBINSON GANGSTER FILMS RIGHT THROUGH TO MORE MODERN STUFF 
ANYTHING WITH GUNS IN WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN 
AND THIS WHOLE SORT OF GLAMOROUS UM 
YES GLAMOROUS GANGSTERS GLAMOROUS GANGSTERS WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN 
FOR ME WHAT I FIND INTERESTING IS THE SHAPES THEY MAKE WITH THIS GUN 
THE GUN POINTS AND EVERYONE ELSE RECOILS 
THE MUSIC FOR LITTLE GREEN BAG IS A SOUNDTRACK ACTUALLY FROM A GUN FILM A GUN TOTING FILM 
WHICH I'D JUST BEEN PLAYING AT HOME BECAUSE I LIKED IT 
IT'S SUCH A DAFT PIECE OF MUSIC I'D NEVER HEARD IT FIRST TIME ROUND WHEN IT WAS RELEASED IN THE SEVENTIES 
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS RIDICULOUS AND I STARTED USING IT FOR REHEARSAL 
AND THE RESPONSE TO IT WAS GREAT EVERYONE LEAPED AROUND AND DANCED 
SO I THOUGHT THIS WAS A RECIPE FOR A GOOD PIECE OF DANCE 
YEAH 
LOOKING BACK ON THE TRACK FOR A LITTLE GREEN BAG 
GOT TO FIND JUST THAT KIND I'M LOSING MY MIND 
OUTTA SIGHT IN THE NIGHT 
OUTTA SIGHT IN THE DAY 
LOOKING BACK ON THE TRACK GONNA DO IT MY WAY 
OUTTA SIGHT IN THE NIGHT OUTTA SIGHT IN THE DAY 
LOOKING BACK ON THE TRACK GONNA DO IT MY WAY 
LOOKING BACK 
LOOKING FOR SOME HAPPINESS 
BUT THERE IS ONLY LONELINESS TO FI I. IND 
JUMP TO THE LEFT TURN TO THE RIGHT 
LOOKING UPSTAIRS LOOKING BEHIND 
IF YOU WANT MUSIC THAT WORKS WITH THE DANCE AND DON'T CONSTRUCT THE DANCE TO FOLLOW THE MUSIC 
THEN YOU NEED TO GET SOMEONE IN TO WRITE MUSIC FOR YOU 
LEA ANDERSON THE FEATHERSTONEHAUGHS' CHOREOGRAPHER BROUGHT THIS TAPE 
A COMPLETED DANCE WHICH SHE'D REHEARSED TO 
USING SONIC YOUTH THE AMERICAN BAND JUST A RECORD FROM THEIR COLLECTION 
WE'VE WORKED THIS WAY BEFORE WHERE SHE REHEARSES TO ONE PIECE OF MUSIC 
AND THEN I MAKE MY OWN PIECE OF MUSIC TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL ONE 
AS YOU CAN HEAR THE MUSIC'S QUITE VIOLENT PASSIONATE AS IS THE DANCE 
I TOLD STEVE WHEN HE FIRST SAW THESE DUETS 
THAT I WANTED TO TRY AND USE SOME OF THE CONTRADICTORY STANCES 
AND ARRANGEMENTS OF TWO PEOPLE PLACED TOGETHER THAT UM 
THAT MADE FOR A RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU COULDN'T EXPLAIN IN WORDS 
YOU CAN'T SAY THEY'VE HAD AN ARGUMENT AND ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT UP 
IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT AS MOST RELATIONSHIPS ARE 
I ASKED STEVE IF HE COULD HELP ME MAKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD RETAIN THIS ODDNESS WITHIN THE DUETS 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT GETTING THE PULSE IN OH RIGHT 
YOU COULD DO IT AT THE END 
THE BASS LINE B. FLAT 
G. 
DOWN TO F. SHARP 
ULTIMATELY I'M GONNA HAVE LOADS OF REALLY BIG BASS YEAH 
AND I'LL DOUBLE UP THE BASS LINE ON THIS RIGHT 
WE NEED HALF THE AMOUNT OF THOSE NOTES 
IT'S GOTTA BE THE SAME SPEED AS THIS SONIC YOUTH TRACK THEY WERE REHEARSING TO 
NO IT KIND OF WON'T WORK UNTIL THE SOUNDS ARE RIGHT 
I WANT MASSIVE ECHO ON THIS 
IT TAKES A WHILE TO BE ABLE TO UM 
FOR A COMPOSER TO LOOK AT DANCE AND KNOW WHAT WILL HELP THE DANCER MAKE IT LOOK MORE EXCITING 
OR WHAT CAN DRAG IT BACK AND MAKE IT LOOK DULL OR BORING 
SO IT'S QUITE A DIFFICULT PROCESS WORKING WITH A COMPOSER SUCCESSFULLY 
I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS NOT TO SWAMP THE DANCE 
NOT TO KIND OF CLASH NOT TO GET TOO BUSY OR DISTRACT FROM THE MOVEMENT 
I THINK THE MUSIC SHOULD DRAW YOU INTO THE MOVEMENT 
THE REPETITIVENESS OF THE MUSIC CERTAINLY HELPS THE ODDNESS 
AND THE INSTRUMENTATION THE STRANGE LITTLE HORN THAT STICKS OUT AND KEEPS GOING 
IT DIGS INTO YOUR BRAIN AND YOU FIND YOURSELF AS YOU'RE WATCHING IT MOVING WITH THE MUSIC 
IT'S VERY VERY COMPELLING MUSIC 
LOOK INSIDE YOURSELF AND YOU CAN LISTEN 
TO WHAT YOUR HEART IS TELLING YOU 
TRUST IN LIFE AND YOU'LL FIND TRUE LOVE IN TIME 
TODAY MYSELF AND ASHLEY INGRAM ARE HOPING TO COMPLETE A SONG CALLED YOU BROUGHT ME BACK TO LIFE 
IN THIS SOMETIMES CRAZY WORLD 
I BELIEVE YOU PROVED IT TO ME BABY 
I'LL SING THE SONG A CAPPELLA TO ASHLEY AND HE'LL WORK ON SOME CHORDS THAT HE FEELS FIT THE MELODY 
SOMETIMES THEY WORK SOMETIMES NOT SO IT'S A CASE OF FINDING ONES THAT WE BOTH ARE HAPPY WITH 
AND LISTEN 
AGAIN CAN WE GO ON THAT THING 
LOOK INSIDE YOURSELF AND LISTEN 
LOOK INSIDE YOURSELF AND LISTEN 
TO WHAT YOUR HEART IS TELLING YOU 
TRUST IN LIFE AND YOU'LL FIND TRUE LOVE 
IN TIME I LIKE IT UP AND THEN COME DOWN 
YEAH SO LOVE HAD DIED 
I JUST HAD TO TUNE IN AND I HEARD THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT MUSICALLY IN MY HEAD 
I HEARD DRUMS I HEARD PIANOS I HEARD STRINGS' 
MY HEART AGAIN DO YOU HAVE A BASS HERE 
I HEAR THAT I CAN HEAR BIG SHINY DUM DUM 
WHEN I WORK WITH ASHLEY I SUPPOSE WE'VE DEVELOPED A CHEMISTRY WHERE HE KNOWS EXACTLY 
THE RIGHT MOOD AND FEEL TO GIVE THE SENTIMENT OF THE LYRICS 
AND HE JUST INSTINCTIVELY KNOWS WHERE TO GO 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE AFTER THE SONG'S RUN TO THAT POINT IT'S UP IN THE AIR 
DAH DAH AND PEOPLE WILL WAIT FOR THAT DAH O. K. 
RELEASE IS GOOD 
BUT THEN I CANNOT FIT THE REST OF THE LYRICS IN I KNOW YOU CAN I CAN'T 
HOW ABOUT IF I WENT ROUND ONE MORE TIME O. K. BECAUSE TO ESTABLISH THE MELODY 
IF I GO RELEASE THE PAIN 
THEN MIDDLE EIGHT 
D. A. NA NA NA NA FA NA NEE 
FAH SUDDENLY 
NA NA NA NA SHOW THAT I'LL BE 
LA LA LA NA NA NA NA SHOW THAT I'LL BE 
AND 
THIS SONG IS ABOUT SOMEONE OR ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN SMITTEN OR BEEN IN A BAD RELATIONSHIP 
AND HAVE DISMISSED THE WHOLE IDEA OF RELATIONSHIPS AND LOVE ALTOGETHER 
THEN YOU MEET SOMEONE AND THE WHOLE THING STARTS TO REVIVE 
IT'S LIKE RESUSCITATION OF THE SPIRIT AND THE EMOTIONS' 
DAH D. A. D. A. DUM 
DAH D. A. D. A. 
LOVE AND YOU AWAKE 
D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. SUDDENLY 
D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. DEE DEE 
D'YOU REMEMBER THAT YES I THINK SO 
NO 
I GOT HERE 
THE LOVE AND SAY AND SAY 
BUT 
D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. DEE 
WHEN YOU BROUGHT ME BACK TO 
THE EMOTION 
WE'VE GOT THE KEYBOARDS DOWN WE'VE JUST PUT THE BASS DOWN NOW WE'LL PUT DOWN THE DRUMS 
I PUT DOWN THE DRUMS BY USING SOUNDS THAT I'VE RECORDED FROM LIVE DRUMS 
AND PUT THEM ONTO KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD 
ONCE THOSE THREE ELEMENTS ARE DOWN THAT'S BASICALLY THE RHYTHM TRACK 
THAT'S A GOOD BED FOR DES'REE TO SING ON 
I CAN FEEL YOU'RE HEALING 
OH H. THE CLOSER YOU GET THE BETTER YOU FEEL 
I FEEL MY SELF ESTEEM'S ABOUT TO RISE SORRY 
SAME DROP HERE IT COMES 
I FELT THE SHAME OF A BROKEN LOVE AFFAIR 
YOU HELPED ME RELEASE 
THE PAIN 
YOUR ENERGY AND SPIRIT ALWAYS MAKE ME SMILE 
WHEN I FEEL LIKE GIVING UP OH DAMN 
I NEED A BREAK ANYWAY MY TOES HAVE CURLED RIGHT UP AND TOUCHED MY SHINS O. K. 
O. K. HERE IT COMES 
I FELT THE SHAME 
OF A BROKEN LOVE AFFAIR 
YOU HELPED ME RELEASE 
SHOW 
SHOW ME YEAH 
D. A. D. A. DEE SHOW W. W YES EXACTLY

THAT SOUNDS ALL RIGHT I RECKON THAT WILL WORK IT SOUNDS WICKED 
FEAR CAN CAUSE EVEN THE BRAVEST TO RETREAT 
A VOICE INSIDE SAID PATIENCE 
NOW I KNOW WHY YEAH YEAH YEAH 
LOVE HAD DIED 
OH 
I DIDN'T LIKE THAT MIDDLE EIGHT 
I LOVED IT O. K. FROM FEAR YEAH FEAR RIGHT THERE 
BECAUSE YOU COULD'VE FEAR CAN CAUSE YES 
FEAR CAN CAUSE 
EVEN THE BRAVEST TO RETREAT 
A VOICE INSIDE SAID PATIENCE 
NOW I KNOW WHY YEAH YEAH YEAH 
LOVE HAD DIED 
BUT YOU BROUGHT ME BACK TO LIFE 
YOU TAUGHT ME HOW 
TO SMILE AGAIN 
I FELT THE SHAME 
OF A BROKEN LOVE AFFAIR 
YOU HELPED ME RELEASE 
LOVE HAD DIED 
BUT YOU BROUGHT ME BACK TO LIFE 
YOU TAUGHT ME HOW 
TO SMILE AGAIN 
NOW I FELT THE SHAME 
OF A BROKEN LOVE AFFAIR 
YOU HELPED ME RELEASE 
OUR LOVE HAS DIE 
NO 
REPEAT UP 
TAKE IT HOME SO YOU CAN COME IN AND LISTEN EXACTLY AND ASSESS 
THERE'S SO MUCH GOOD STUFF IN THERE WE KEEP THAT AND JUST WORK WITH IT 
YOU HELPED ME RELEASE 
SURELY 
A HEART WILL SET FREE 
I FELT SO LOW AT TIMES WANTED TO DIE 
I'VE JUST DONE MY VOCAL AND FOR A CHANGE I'M QUITE PLEASED WITH IT 
SO NEXT WE'RE GOING TO ADD STRINGS AND THEN BACKING VOCALS TO COMPLETE IT 
A VOICE INSIDE SAID PATIENCE NOW I KNOW WHY YEAH YEAH YEAH 
LOVE HAD DIED BUT YOU BROUGHT ME BACK TO LIFE 
FOR ME MUSIC IS ABOUT FEELING 
I DON'T LIKE TO INTELLECTUALISE OR THINK ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING TOO MUCH 
SO I WAS SITTING HERE LOOKING OUT OF MY WINDOW FEELING A SENSE OF MISSING 
ER YOU KNOW FEELING A SENSE OF LONELINESS 
AND THE CHORDS AND THE SOUND CAME VERY NATURALLY I WAS JUST 
AND THE SECOND PART WAS A LOVE TUNE THE MELODY THAT THE FLUTE PLAYS 
THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORIGINAL THEME 
WHEN I WAS COMPOSING THE PIECE 
I WAS UNSURE WHAT INSTRUMENT WOULD PLAY THE MELODY LINE 
I ALREADY KNEW THE FLUTE WOULD PLAY THE HARMONY AND ADD A DARK TEXTURE 
SO I WANTED SOMETHING TO BLEND WITH THAT SO IT WAS OUT OF THE MUTED TRUMPET 
OR WITH THE FLUGELHORN 
I DECIDED ON THE FLUGELHORN BECAUSE I FELT IT WAS A MORE HAUNTING SOUND 
AND IT WAS DARKER WHICH WAS WHICH COMPLEMENTED THE MOOD I WANTED TO SET 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PIECE 
ONE TWO 
WELL THE PIECE SUNDAY CALLING IS ABOUT MISSING SOMEONE WHO YOU LOVE OR IS VERY CLOSE TO YOU 
IT'S A JOURNEY THROUGH YOUR SADNESS 
THEN IT GOES ON AND YOU DEVELOP INTO ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT YOU MISS THEM 
AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU START TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT WHY YOU LOVE THIS PERSON 
THIS IS DANNY ORIN 
SIMONE NANA GEORGE 
STEVE SANDY AND DEAN 
I LOVE IT JUMPIN' AND JIVE UNDER MY LOVE UP AND ALIVE 
THE IDEA OF THE SONG IS THAT THERE'S CALL AND RESPONSE A LOT OF THE TIME 
SO THE FIRST BIT OF THE TUNE GOES D. A. NA NA NO D. A. NA NA NO 
D. A. NA NA NO D. A. NA NA NO NA NA WA WA WA WA WA WA 
I HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM ANY WRITTEN OUT MUSIC I'VE JUST SUNG IT TO THEM 
WE JUST PLOUGHED THROUGH IT LIKE A CHARGING ELEPHANT THEY PICK IT UP AS THEY GO ALONG 
D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. NA NA 
THEN THE SINGING STARTS 
WHEN THE VOICE COMES IN I WANT THAT'S THE SAME RHYTHM VOICE 
THE SECOND TIME THE VOCAL COMES THERE'S A HARMONY PART ONE WANT YOU TWO TO TRY OUT I'LL SHOW YOU 
IT GOES 
EACH HOUR I SAVE ME THE FLOWER YOU GAVE ME 
THE RESPONSE TO THAT SHOULD BE A BIG UNISON EVERYBODY DOING IT SHALL WE TRY THAT ONE TWO THREE 
EACH HOUR I SAVED YOU THE POWER YOU GAVE ME 
I LOVE IT JUMPIN' AND JIVE UNDER MY LOVE UP AND ALIVE 
I LOVE IT LIFTIN' ME UP HOISTIN' ME UP MAKIN' ME SHOUT 
I LOVE IT JUMPIN' AND JIVE UNDER MY LOVE UP AND ALIVE 
I LOVE IT HOISTING ME UP WAKIN' ME UP 
CRAZY YO YO OF LOVE 
CRAZY YO YO OF LOVE 
CRAZY YO YO OF LOVE CRAZY YO YO 
OH OF LOVE 
I'M A LION IN A JUNGLE 
IN A PEAR TREE IT'S A NATURAL THRILL 
LIGHTNING AND THUNDER 
IS FRIGHTENING 
I'M UNDER YOUR SPELL 
EACH HOUR I SAVE ME THE FLOWER YOU GAVE ME 
WE WALK IN THE DARK LIKE YOU WALK IN 
WE MOVE IN THAT WAY LIKE YOU DO 
I LOVE IT JUMPIN' AND JIVE UNDER MY LOVE UP AND ALIVE 
I LOVE IT PICKIN' ME UP WINDIN' ME UP MAKIN' ME SHOUT 
I LOVE IT JUMPIN' AND JIVE UNDER MY LOVE UP AND ALIVE 
I LOVE IT WINDIN' ME UP WINDIN' ME UP CRAZY YO YO 
OF LOVE 
CRAZY YO YO OF LOVE 
CRAZY YO YO OF LOVE 
CRAZY YO YO OF LOVE 
YO YO OF LOVE 
CRAZY YO YO OF LOVE CRAZY YO YO OF LOVE 
CRAZY YO YO OF LOVE 
THAT'S THE KIND OF MUSIC I WROTE FOR HORROR FILMS WHICH IS WHERE I STARTED WRITING MUSIC FOR FILMS 
THE PIECE YOU'VE GIVEN ME IS VERY DIFFERENT NOT ONLY IN ITS STYLE 
BUT IT'S SHORT NINETY SECONDS INSTEAD OF NINETY MINUTES FOR A FEATURE FILM 
FIRST YOU SEE THEM START WALKING THROUGH THE SQUARE 
THERE'S NO DRAMA IT'S INCIDENTAL SCENE SETTING IF YOU LIKE 
SO I STARTED WRITING A SORT OF 
WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE CHURCH BELLS 
IT ROLLS ALONG AND REPEATS AND HAS NO GREAT MELODIC CONTENT 
IT DOESN'T TELL YOU MUCH I'M SAVING THE DRAMA FOR LATER IN THE PIECE 
IF I PLAY WHAT I PROGRAMMED INTO THE COMPUTER YOU CAN SEE HOW I'VE BUILT THE PIECE UP ADDING INSTRUMENTS 
IT JUST WEAVES IN AND OUT OF THE PIANO STILL NOT SAYING ANYTHING DRAMATIC IT'S STILL QUITE INNOCENT 
THEN I ADDED STRINGS 
AT THIS POINT IN THE FILM WHERE THE LIGHT 
SOMETHING THAT WAS HAPPENING BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS THEY WERE FALLING IN LOVE OR THERE WAS INFATUATION 
SO I CHOSE A GLOCKENSPIEL WHICH REMINDS ME OF A MUSIC BOX 
OF BEING A CHILD OF INNOCENT THINGS 
THOUGH IN OTHER CONTEXTS I'VE USED IT IN HORROR FILMS TO SIGNIFY EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE 
THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S SUCH INNOCENT MUSIC 
HERE IT WAS SOMETHING MAGICAL IF I SPIN THE PICTURE BACK YOU CAN SEE 
THE POINT WHEN THE GLOCKENSPIEL COMES IN 
NOW THE MUSIC IS HELD IN SUSPENSE 
YOU THINK SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN 
AND IN FACT THE LIGHTS ON THE BRIDGE GO ON QUITE A MAGIC MOMENT 
THEY BEGIN TO DANCE TOGETHER THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY 
THIS IS A MOMENT FOR THEM 
BUT I ALSO WANTED IT TO SEEM VERY DREAMLIKE AS IF PERHAPS THIS HADN'T REALLY HAPPENED 
BECAUSE YOU'LL SEE LATER 
THE LOW CELLO SIGNIFIES TENSION THEY TAKE THE GIRL AWAY 
THIS COULD ALL HAVE BEEN THE BOY'S DREAM 
AS THE PHOTO BLOWS AWAY 
THE PIECE RESOLVES MELODICALLY AND HARMONICALLY 
AND FADES 
BUT YOU COULD HAVE DONE THIS IN MANY WAYS I'LL DEMONSTRATE THAT TO YOU 
THIS IS PERHAPS COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE THIS WILL BE DOING IT IN A MODERN DANCE STYLE 
PERHAPS BY PLAYING THIS TO YOU I CAN SHOW THAT THAT MIGHT WORK FOR INCIDENTAL MUSIC 
BUT FOR ANY EMOTIONAL CONTENT OF THEM BEING IN LOVE IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK 
THIS GIVES A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IMPRESSION OF THE FILM 
ALMOST LIKE A POP VIDEO 
AND IT WORKS FINE FOR THIS POINT IN THE FILM FOR ME 
BUT AT THE MOMENT THE LIGHT GOES ON AND THEY GET ONTO THE BRIDGE 
IT'S UNABLE TO CONVEY ANY COMPLEXITY IN TERMS OF THE CHARACTERS 
DRAMATIC CHORD I CAN DO A SYNC ON THAT WHICH GIVES A DRAMA BUT NOT MUCH ELSE 
NOW THIS IS LIKE AN M. T. V. VIDEO 
I REALLY DID THAT JUST TO PROVE I LIKE MUSIC LIKE THAT BUT IT'S NOT RIGHT FOR THIS KIND OF FILM 
EXCUSE ME COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE CHESTER ROW IS CHESTER ROW UM 
YEAH I'LL SHOW YOU 
GLOCKENSPIEL FLOURISH 
AT THE BEGINNING THERE'S NOT A LOT HAPPENING 
SO I WANTED TO INJECT SOME ENERGY AND PERHAPS A LITTLE TENSION INTO IT 
SO I PUT JUST A REPEATED C. IN THE VIOLA 
I DECIDED TO USE A STRINGED INSTRUMENT THERE 
AND IMMEDIATELY BY DOING THAT 
I THINK YOU WONDER WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
THEN I DECIDED TO GIVE IT MORE RHYTHM OR SPIKINESS SO I PUT 
BY DOING THAT IN A WAY THAT MIGHT MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF THE GIRL MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY TROUBLESOME 
THEY GO OFF TOGETHER 
AND IT FEELS MORE RELAXED SO I WANTED TO SHOW THAT IN THE MUSIC 
I BROUGHT IN A REALLY LOVELY INSTRUMENT THE CLARINET 
IT GIVES A REALLY WARM FEELING 
WHICH IS HOW I FELT THE TWO PEOPLE FELT WARM ABOUT EACH OTHER 
AND I ALSO CHOSE A STRING QUARTET 
BECAUSE THAT HAS SUCH A HUGE RANGE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOUNDS AND TONES 
IT GOES REALLY LOW FROM THE CELLO AND HIGH UP FOR THE VIOLINS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN 
WHEN I GOT TO THE BIT WHEN THEY'RE TURNING AND THE LIGHTS ARE TURNING 
THAT SEEMED RATHER SAD BECAUSE THEY SEEMED VERY HAPPY TOGETHER BUT THEY WERE GOING TO GET SPLIT UP 
I WROTE A LITTLE SAD MOMENT 
BUT THAT SEEMED TOO SAD SO I TRIED TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT HAPPIER 
AND TO BRING OUT THE TURNING WITH ALL THE LIGHTS AND EVERYTHING 
I PUT IN TRIPLETS IN THE ACCOMPANIMENT 
FOR THE REST OF THE PIECE EVERYTHING'S BEEN 
THAT KIND OF FEELING 
BUT NOW JUST TO MAKE A CHANGE 
AND THEN PUTTING THAT TUNE TOGETHER WITH THE TRIPLETS 
BECAUSE THIS IS A SHORT FILM I HAD TO FIND A REALLY SHORT THEME 
THAT I COULD USE IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO SHOW DIFFERENT FEELINGS 
BECAUSE IT'S MOSTLY SAD I CHOSE A FALLING THEME 
ALL THE NOTES ACTUALLY GO DOWNHILL WHICH IS A SAD FEELING 
EXCEPT FOR WHEN THEY ARE FEELING HAPPY AND THEY'RE DOING TURNING 
WHEN IT ACTUALLY GOES UP 
I THINK THE STRONGEST EMOTIONAL POINT IN THE FILM IS WHEN THE GIRL IS LED AWAY BY THE POLICE IT'S REALLY SAD 
IT'S JUST VERY LONELY 
YOU WONDER WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
FUNNILY ENOUGH THAT'S A STRONGER EMOTIONAL FEELING THAN WHEN EVERYBODY'S PLAYING AT ONCE 
SO IN A WAY TO DO LESS ACTUALLY CAN CONVEY MORE EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY A FEW NOTES 
THAT WAS NICE 
EXCUSE ME COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE CHESTER ROW IS CHESTER ROW UM 
YEAH I'LL SHOW YOU 
MY NAME'S HOWARD GREENHALGH I'M A MUSIC VIDEO DIRECTOR 
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN SOME OF MY WORK THINGS SUCH AS SOUNDGARDEN 
SUEDE SKY HIGH IN THE AIRWAVES 
PET SHOP BOYS I WOULDN'T NORMALLY DO THIS KIND OF THING 
TODAY I'M DOING SOMETHING THAT I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE ILLUSTRATING A PIECE OF CLASSICAL MUSIC 
SAINT JOHN'S PASSION BY BACH 
THE REASON WHY I'M DOING THIS IS TO TEST MYSELF 
TO SEE WHAT IMAGES THAT I COME UP WITH WITH A STYLE OF MUSIC THAT I'VE NEVER WORKED WITH BEFORE 
I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE ORIGINAL USE WAS FOR THE MUSIC 
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING HISTORICAL OR RELIGIOUS I WANTED TO RELATE THE MUSIC TO SOMETHING MODERN 
SOMETHING MORE CONTEMPORARY 
I THINK THE MUSIC SAINT JOHN'S PASSION TOOK ME ON A JOURNEY 
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE MUSIC WAS LIKE CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN 
IT HAD TOIL IN IT THERE WAS SWEAT AND TEARS IN IT AT THE SAME TIME 
IT HAD A PASSIONATE CHARACTER TO IT 
THOSE CRESCENDOS ATTRACTED ME TO THE MUSIC 
THE STORY IS ABOUT DIFFERENT DESIRES THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
A DESIRE TO BE THE FASTEST THE STRONGEST A DESIRE TO BE ATTRACTIVE 
A DESIRE TO ESCAPE TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL 
A ROCK 
HANGS IN THE AIR 
IT HAS ONLY ONE DESIRE 
NOT TO FALL 
A PASSION TO BE WEIGHTLESS 
IF DESIRE WAS A WINDOW THROUGH WHICH WE COULD LOOK 
THE ROCK WOULD SEE ITSELF AS A BUBBLE FLOATING IN THE BREEZE 
POWER 
NOTHING HAPPENS IN RUGELEY AS OF GENERAL 
RUGELEY'S A DYING TOWN 
THE LARGE TOWNS AROUND ARE BUILDING UP AND WE'RE SHRINKING DOWN 
THE REASON I SKATE IS BECAUSE I LOVE IT 
SKATING IS AN ARTFORM IT'S DIFFERENT 
YOU WORRY ABOUT BILLS IF YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH FOOD WHATEVER 
AND THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN YOU'RE SKATING COS IT'S JUST YOU 
IT'S A COOL THING 
THIS SKATE PARK IS THE ONLY PLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HANG OUT IN RUGELEY 
MATT BODEN AND HIS MATES ARE ORGANISING A SKATE AND MUSIC FESTIVAL 
PEOPLE IN RUGELEY ARE SURPRISED SOMEONE'S DOING THIS 
EVERYONE'S EXCITED 
EVEN IF THEY HATE SKATING SOMETHING'S GOING ON 
WE'LL GO THROUGH WHAT'S GOING ON 
WE'RE ORGANISING THIS IT'S PROPERLY BIG ISN'T IT 
IT IS GONNA BE BIG WE TALKED TO EVERYONE EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S GETTING AROUND FAST 
I'M SCARED ABOUT THE MONEY THAT'S MY WORRY AS WELL 
IT'S THREE WEEKS TO SORT OUT ABOUT THREE GRAND 
GRAND A WEEK YEAH SO YOU KNOW 
ROBIN IS HELPING MATT WITH THE SKATE COMPETITION DAN'S ORGANISING PHOTOGRAPHY 
AND LEFTY IS IN CHARGE OF THE ARTISTIC SIDE WHICH WILL INCLUDE A TAGGING COMPETITION 
ARTIFICIAL DEGRADATION A LOCAL BAND 
HAVE BEEN BOOKED TO PLAY 
ME AND DANNY WRITE THE LYRICS AND ARE VOCALISTS 
DANNY'S MY BOYFRIEND HE GETS A BIT AGGRESSIVE BUT HE'S A PEACEKEEPER 
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH TAMMY IS IMPORTANT 
SOME OF THE MATERIAL WE USE IS ELABORATED FROM ARGUMENTS 
AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
KILF ONLY JOINED THE BAND TWO WEEKS AGO 
I ALWAYS WANTED TO TRY THE BASE AND I'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR A YEAR 
I'VE NEVER PLAYED IN A BAND BEFORE I'M GOING TO BE NERVOUS FOR THE GIG 
NOT ALL SKATERS ARE IN INTO NU METAL 
SO MATT TRAVELS TO TAMWORTH TO CHECK OUT SOME ALTERNATIVE SOUNDS 
PEOPLE WANT TO SKATE TO THE MUSIC THEY LIKE 
IF THEY'RE A HIP HOP PERSON THEY DON'T WANT METALLICA PLAYING 
IF THEY'RE A METALLICA FAN THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR EMINEM 
OUR GROUP IS CALLED UCAP UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL 
THERE'S SEVEN OF US 
WE'RE THE GARAGE M. C.'S 
THE BAND HASN'T BEEN TOGETHER LONG BUT WE'RE REALLY TIGHT 
WE'RE TRYING TO GET THINGS UP AND RUNNING 
AND WRITING LOADS OF TRACKS 
I'D REALLY LIKE YOU ALL TO PLAY WE'D LOVE TO DO IT 
IS THE ACTUAL GIG A COMPETITION OR IS JUST THE SKATING 
THE SKATING'S THE COMPETITION THE GIG'S JUST ABOUT HAVING FUN 
ENJOYING MUSIC BASICALLY YEAH 
I'VE HAD TO COME UP WITH A COUPLE OF IDEAS FOR FLYERS 
AND RUN THE BY THE ORGANISERS 
THE DESIGN FOR THE FLYER IS A PHOTOGRAPH 
THAT I'D TAKEN OF A GROUP OF FRIENDS JUST POSING 
IT'S JUST BASICALLY A SILHOUETTE OF THAT PICTURE 
I'M PUTTING SOME IDEAS TOGETHER FOR A POSTER FOR THE SKATE FEST 
I SEARCHED FOR THINGS TO DO WITH SKATING ON THE INTERNET 
AND I FOUND SOME GRAFFITI WEBSITES 
AND I TOOK DIFFERENT LETTERING OFF THERE AND COLOURS 
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE WEATHER 
BECAUSE IF IT RAINS ALL THE PREPARATION WILL GO DOWN THE PAN 
WE WERE THINKING ABOUT COVERING IT BUT IT'S PROVING TOO COSTLY 
WE WERE THINKING OF SCAFFOLDING AND COVERS BUT IT'S NOT PRACTICAL 
ONE ALTERNATIVE IS A LOCAL ROCK VENUE 
THE RED ROSE 
THEY'VE GOT THE BUILDERS IN 
GOOD TO MEET YOU GRAB A SEAT 
SO YOU'RE DOING MUSIC ART 
SKATEBOARDING AND ROLLERBLADING 
SKATEBOARD AND ROLLERBLADE YEAH 
I SUGGEST YOU HAVE A LOOK BECAUSE YOU'RE UP AGAINST A HARD JOB HERE 
RIGHT MATT 
AUDITORIUM OBVIOUSLY YOU ALREADY KNOW IT YEAH IT'S CHANGED 
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF REFURBISHMENT 
BY THE SIXTEENTH THIS IS GONNA BE READY 
O. K. THIS IS WHERE I SEE YOU'VE GOT THE PROBLEM OUTSIDE MATT 
ON THE ONE HAND STAGING THE EVENT AT THE RED ROSE WOULD MEAN THE BANDS WOULD BE IN THE DRY 
BUT MATT WOULD HAVE TO RENT SKATE RAMPS AND PROTECT THEM FROM RAIN 
THE BIG PROBLEM YOU'VE GOT IS COVERING THIS AREA YEAH 
WE HAVE LOOKED AT A MARQUEE BUT IT'S THE COST RIGHT 
THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD MEETING I'M REALLY PLEASED 
BUT I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT TWO THINGS 
FINANCIALLY WE NEED TO GET THE MONEY SORTED 
AND WE'RE ON A SHORT DEADLINE 
WHEN THEY ASKED US TO GO TO RUGELEY IT WAS LIKE OH I DON'T KNOW 
THAT CAME AS A BIG SURPRISE TO US THE SKATING THING 
WE WEREN'T EXPECTING IT AT ALL 
MARISSA AND JADE ALSO GO TO CLASSES TO LEARN STREET DANCING AND BREAK DANCING 
THEY'RE HOPING THEY CAN GIVE A DANCE PERFORMANCE 
SLOWLY SLOWLY 
UNLIKE TAMWORTH RUGELEY ISN'T FAMOUS FOR ITS STREET CULTURE 
BUT THERE IS ONE KNOWN BREAK DANCER WHO LIVES THERE 
ROCKAFELLER SKANK BY FATBOY SLIM 
I LEARNT MY BREAK DANCING 
FROM THE INTERNET AND DOWNLOADING STUFF 
YOU COULDN'T GET ME OFF THE COMPUTER FOR A WHILE I WANTED TO DO IT PROPERLY 
I TRY AND PRACTISE FOR TWO HOURS EVERY DAY 
THAT'S PHYSICALLY PRACTISING AND RESEARCHING SOME STUFF 
AND STUDYING IT 
EVERY TIME YOU GET A NEW MOVE OUT IT'S A SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT 
IN WHAT YOU DO 
I'D LOVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FESTIVAL 
JUST TO SEE HOW THE CROWD REACTS 
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME 
ONE OF THE WAYS MATT HOPES TO FINANCE THE FESTIVAL IS BY RAISING SPONSORSHIP 
ALL RIGHT I'M MATT HOW ARE YOU 
GOT YOUR E. MAIL 
SO HOW'S IT GOING 
WE'VE GOT A LOT TO STILL SORT OUT 
WE'VE JUST COME TO TALK ABOUT POSSIBLE SPONSORSHIP FOR THE EVENT 
SIXTEENTH FEBRUARY YEAH 
LITTLE BIT LATE ORGANISING IT 
WE HAVEN'T GOT A BUDGET TO GIVE YOU ANY CASH TO HELP 
BUT CERTAINLY WE COULD HELP YOU WITH PROMOTION 
WE COULD GIVE YOU SOME PRODUCT TO HELP YOU OUT GIVE OUT YOUR FLIERS 
YOU'RE LATE ON GETTING THE PEOPLE 
MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO GET THE FLIERS AND POSTERS OUT 
LATER ON THIS EVENING WE'RE HAVING A MEETING WITH THE DESIGNERS AND GETTING THE FINAL THING DONE 
PRINTED NEXT WEEK 
SO THERE'S NO CASH BUT AT LEAST MATT'S GOT SOME PRIZES FOR THE COMPETITION 
SORRY SARAH COULDN'T MAKE IT ANY IDEAS WHY 
SARAH COULDN'T COME BUT SENT HER IDEAS IN WITH A FRIEND 
THE IDEA WAS TO PUT GRAFFITI IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE FIGURE AND NOT USE COLOUR 
I'VE DONE SOME ROUGH COPIES OF AN IDEA FOR JUST 
ONE DESIGN BASICALLY THAT'S DAMN COOL 
THAT'S THE BIG VERSION WHEN'S THE DEADLINE TUESDAY 
THAT'S THE LATEST BECAUSE WE WANT THEM SORTED ON WEDNESDAY 
WE REALLY NEED TO HURRY UP BASICALLY AS IT'S IN TWO DAYS 
DAN HAS PUT TOGETHER A PHOTOGRAPHY TEAM OF FELLOW ART STUDENTS SARAH BEECH AND MARK HENDRY 
SKATING'S IMPORTANT 
COS IT'S JUST CREATIVE AND THAT'S WHY I'M AN ARTIST AS WELL 
ART AND SKATING HAVE GOT A LOT IN COMMON 
I'VE NEVER RUN A FESTIVAL AS SUCH 
OR A PHOTOGRAPHY TEAM SO IT'S A NEW THING BUT HOPEFULLY I'LL LEARN 
WHAT I LIKE FROM IT 
PEOPLE DON'T EXPECT IT TO HAPPEN HOPEFULLY IT WILL HAPPEN 
AND I'LL PUT MOST OF MY EFFORT INTO IT 
RUGELEY'S DYING SO IT'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE TO DO ALL MY MATES 
ARTIFICIAL DEGRADATION ARE IN CRISIS 
THEY'VE LOST THEIR DRUMMER TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE FESTIVAL 
WE'RE HAVING SOME AUDITIONS BUT WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE PICKING A DECENT DRUMMER 
SO THAT'S CAUSING PROBLEMS 
IF WE GET THAT SORTED BY NEXT WEEK WE'LL BE FINE 
WITH A WEEK'S PREPARATION WE'LL BE GREAT 
AFTER AGONISING THEY'VE DECIDED TO STAGE THE EVENT AT THE RED ROSE 
LEFTY CAN COMPLETE THE FLIER DESIGN AND TAKE IT TO THE PRINTERS 
THAT'S FINE 
A FEW DAYS LATER THE FLIERS ARE BEING PRINTED 
EVEN THOUGH THE TEAM HAVEN'T RAISED ENOUGH MONEY TO STAGE THE EVENT 
WHAT'S MORE MATT'S GONE MISSING 
MATT'S GONE A. W. O. L. AND WE CAN'T CONTACT HIM AT ALL 
WE'VE GOT SEVEN DAYS LEFT THREE THOUSAND OR ODD DOWN 
OR IF NOT MORE BECAUSE WE NEED SO MUCH MORE MONEY 
ROBIN AND LEFTY HAVE TO PICK UP THE PIECES AND STAND IN FOR MATT 
AT A MEETING AT THE BANK 
WE WENT IN MET THE GUY TONY HE SEEMED ALL RIGHT 
BUT ONCE WE'D OUTLINED THE ACTUAL COSTS FOR THE PAINT AND FOR THE COMPETITION 
WHEN OUR QUOTA'S NOW LIKE FOUR THOUSAND 
HE'S LIKE ALL RIGHT THEN 
HE DID SAY HE HAD SOME MONEY BUT HE HAD NO IDEA WE NEEDED SO MUCH 
SO KEEP AT IT EH 
IN TAMWORTH UNAWARE THAT THE FESTIVAL IS IN JEOPARDY 
MARISA AND JADE ARE REHEARSING THEIR DANCE STEPS 
TO PUT DANCERS TOGETHER IF WE THINK LIKE OF ANY DANCE MOVES 
OR WE SEE THEM ON T. V. WE JUST PUT THEM TOGETHER 
IT'S NOT THAT HARD 
SOMETIMES IT LOOKS REALLY HARD TO SO BUT SOME SMALL STEPS WE USED TO LEARN IN PRIMARY SCHOOL 
OR WHEN WE USED TO GO TAP DANCING 
YOU JUST PUT THOSE BITS IN AND IF YOU PUT ATTITUDE INTO IT IT LOOKS GOOD 
WHILE ROBIN AND LEFTY BECOME INCREASINGLY NERVOUS THAT THEY WON'T PULL IT OFF 
THE LOCAL PAPER'S RUN AN ARTICLE FEATURING AN INTERVIEW WITH MATT 
THERE IT IS 
MEET THE PERSON WHO IS SINGLE HANDEDLY SHADY MAN 
SINGLE HANDEDLY WHAT THE HELL IS THAT 
AMAZINGLY ALL THE ORGANISATION IS BEING DONE BY THIS TEENAGER 
HE WASN'T EVEN DOING IT SINGLE HANDEDLY TO BEGIN WITH 
CAN'T BELIEVE THAT 
OH MY GOD 
HALF OF THAT ISN'T TRUE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T PUT THAT 
OH GOD I'VE GOT A FEW PEOPLE HELPING ME NOW AND NOW HE'S LEFT US IN THE LURCH 
THE BANDS AREN'T PROPERLY ORGANISED YET 
WE'VE GOT TO BOOK THE MARQUEE GET THE RAMPS ALL THE SUPPLIES FOR THE PAINTING AND 
HE SAYS HE'S ORGANISED ALL THAT BUT HE HASN'T HAS HE 
WE GOT SEVEN DAYS FROM TOMORROW 
YEAH IT'S NOT A LOT IS IT 
WHAT WE GONNA DO 
OH NO 
OH GOD 
THAT WEEKEND AT THE SKATE PARK 
MATT TURNS UP OUT OF THE BLUE WHAT'S GOING ON NOW 
IT JUST NEEDS MORE SORTING OUT 
I AIN'T GOT MUCH TIME AS I HAD 
GOT THE QUOTE ON THE MARQUEE WHICH IS TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED 
WHICH WE CAN'T AFFORD SO 
I'M THINKING RENTING THE RAMPS OUT AND GOING TOO PITCH 
IF IT'S SUNNY WE KEEP ON GOING WITH THE MUSIC AND RAMPS 
IF IT RAINS THAT'S THREE THOUSAND WASTED PUT FAITH IN THE WEATHER 
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE COMING FOR THE RAMPS THEY'LL STILL BE THERE 
IF IT RAINS THEN YOU KNOW 
PEOPLE KNOW THE SCORE 
GOT TO MAKE SURE IT'S EITHER THE MARQUEE AND NO RAMPS OR RAMPS AND NO MARQUEE 
WITH ONLY A FEW DAYS TO GO MATT ABANDONS THE IDEA OF HIRING A MARQUEE NOT ENOUGH MONEY 
THEN AT THE LAST MINUTE A DONATION COMES IN FROM THE PRINCE'S TRUST 
WEATHER PERMITTING IT LOOKS LIKE THE FESTIVAL CAN GO AHEAD 
RUMOUR'S BEEN GOING ROUND THAT IT'S BEEN CANCELLED BUT IT'S NOT 
I STILL THINK IT'S GONNA BE GREAT IT'S A GREAT THING TO DO 
BUT I KNOW IT'S A LOT MORE WORK AND IT'S NOT A RIDE IN THE PARK SORTING IT OUT 
I'M SWEEPING ALL THE SURFACES AND STUFF NEEDS TO BE CLEANED 
IF PEOPLE SKATE THEY HIT PEBBLES AND THEY'LL FALL OVER SO WE'RE JUST MAKING SURE IT'S ALL CLEAN 
THE WEATHER FORECAST'S COME UP REALLY WELL 
FINGER'S CROSSED IT WILL BE COOL 
I FEEL RELIEVED TO KNOW THE MAJORITY OF IT'S DONE 
WE WERE A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE MORNING 
I'M GLAD WE CANCELLED THE COVER COS IT'S PRETTY DAMN NICE WEATHER IT SHOULD BE GOOD 
WE DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN NO 
I'VE JUST BEEN SORTING OUT PRIZES WHILE YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING ABOUT 
FIRST PRIZE IS THE SKATES I'VE GOT A GOODY BAG FOR THEM 
BLUE GOODY IT'S A LARGE THE KIDS WILL BE PRETTY SMALL I'VE GOT A SMALLER ONE 
I'M FEELING PRETTY COOL COS IT'S ALL COMING OFF 
THERE'S BEEN TROUBLE FOR THREE MONTHS 
SORTING EVERYTHING OUT 
SOMETIMES IT GETS ON TOP OF YOU I CAN'T BE ARSED WITH THIS 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TOMORROW 
THE RAMPS ARE UP BUT IT'S NOT ALL GOING TO PLAN 
THE SOUND ENGINEER HASN'T ARRIVED 
WE'VE GOT AN HOUR AND A QUARTER FOR HIM TO DO A SOUND CHECK AND GO 
THAT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN 
WE WANTED MORE PHOTOGRAPHS THAN WE GOT 
BUT WE COULDN'T GET INTO COLLEGE 
WE HAVEN'T AS MANY AS WE WANTED REALLY 
THE BITS AT THE SKATE PARK ARE O. K. 
I'M A BIT DISAPPOINTED REALLY 
AT COLLEGE YOU CAN PRINT THEM AND ADJUST THE CONTRAST 
THEY'RE SO SMALL PEOPLE WILL HAVE SQUINT 
I'M FEELING NERVOUS 
I'VE GOT BUTTERFLIES IN MY STOMACH YOU KNOW 
I'M FEELING SO NERVOUS IT'S UNREAL 
BUT I'LL GIVE THEM WHAT I GOT 
FINALLY THE SOUND ENGINEER TURNS UP 
ARTIFICIAL DEGRADATION 
NEVER DID FIND A NEW DRUMMER BUT THEIR OLD DRUMMER HAS STEPPED IN 
THE PHOTOGRAPHY TEAM ARE REDUCED TO TWO SARAH NEVER MATERIALISED
