O. K. I GIVE YOU GLOBAL VILLAGE TRUCKING COMPANY 
ALL YOURS 
I BUST IN AND OUT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES 
LIKE A REPETITIOUS BALLOON 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THE B. B. C. FOLLOWED A ROCK GROUP LIVING IN A COMMUNE 
IN NORFOLK WITH THEIR FAMILIES ROADIES AND MANAGERS 
THEIR AIM WAS TO BE SELF RELIANT AND TO MAKE IT BIG WITHOUT A RECORD LABEL 
WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD 
I WANTED TO BE A ROCK STAR I WANTED TO BE A ROCK STAR 
AT HOME OR ON THE ROAD THEY WERE DETERMINED TO SPREAD THE MESSAGE OF GLOBAL VILLAGE TRUCKING COMPANY 
IT'S LIKE THERE'S STARS IN THE SKY IT WAS A GIVEN THAT WHAT WE WERE DOING WAS JUST GOING 
TO GET BIGGER AND YOU KNOW LOADS OF OTHER PEOPLE WERE DOING IT IN PARALLEL 
SUCCESS FOLLOWED WHEN THEY RECORDED SESSIONS FOR THE B. B. C.'S JOHN PEEL AND TWO ALBUMS 
BUT IT ALL FELL APART 
AS I RECALL IT IT WAS MIKE WHO WAS THE FIRST ONE TO SAY 
LOOK I'M JUST STANDING UP ON STAGE AGAIN AND I JUST CAN'T THINK WHAT I'M DOING HERE 
THERE WAS PROBABLY A SHELF LIFE FOR THE BAND 
IT WAS DESTINED TO DO WHAT IT DID OVER A PERIOD OF TIME 
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT REVISITS THE ORIGINAL FILM 
ALL CHICKS HERE ARE FAITHFUL AND ALL THAT 
FINDS OUT WHAT BECAME OF THE GROUP'S MEMBERS 
THE ISSUE IS GOING TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE DEAL 
AND JOINS THEM AS THEY REUNITE FOR THEIR FIRST GIG IN THIRTY YEARS 
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S GONNA BE ABOUT FIFTY PEOPLE AND A DOG 
OR WHETHER THERE ARE GONNA BE PEOPLE FLOWING ON TO LEYTONSTONE HIGH ROAD 
I'M GONNA CONFESS IT ON THE JUDGMENT DAY 
I'M GONNA BEAT THAT SIN LORDY LORD 
WHEN FIVE YOUNG MEN DECIDE TO FORM A POP GROUP 
THEY DON'T USUALLY SET UP HOUSE IN A REMOTE COTTAGE 
IN THE WILDS OF NORFOLK TOGETHER WITH ALL THEIR GIRLFRIENDS 
BUT THE GLOBAL VILLAGE TRUCKING COMPANY AREN'T AN ORDINARY GROUP 
THEY'RE NOT VERY WORRIED ABOUT MAKING MONEY 
AND THEY WON'T TAKE ANY OF THE USUAL SHORTCUTS TO SUCCESS 
WHAT THEY ARE DETERMINED TO DO IS TO MAKE THEIR OWN WAY 
WITHOUT WHAT THEY REGARD AS THE MOGULS OF THE RECORD BUSINESS 
THE PROMOTERS THE BIG MANAGERS THE PROFESSIONAL MANIPULATORS GLOBAL VILLAGE WANT TO DO IT THEIR WAY 
OM 
WELL WE'RE A ROCK AND ROLL BAND WITH A DIFFERENCE 
THE DIFFERENCE BEING THE FACT THAT WE LIVE AS A COMMUNITY OF ABOUT FIFTEEN PEOPLE 
ALL OF WHOM IN THEIR OWN WAYS CONTRIBUTE TO THE MUSIC WHICH COMES OUT 
EVEN THOUGH THE FINAL PRODUCT IS JUST FIVE MUSICIANS ON STAGE 
OUR WHOLE HOUSEHOLD IS A SELF CONTAINED WORKING UNIT 
WHICH INCLUDES ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HELP GET THE SHOW ON THE ROAD LIKE THE ROADIES 
THE MANAGERS AND THEN ALL PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES LIKE BACK AT THE HOUSE DOING THE DOMESTIC THINGS 
AND IT'S ALL LIKE A SORT OF GREAT BIG FAMILY AND A WORKING TEAM ALL IN ONE 
ALL PUSHING TOWARDS THIS END PRODUCT OF GETTING THE MUSIC OUT 
LIKE OUR AIMS ARE TO GET THE MUSIC AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE 
TO GET IT OUT TO AS MANY PEOPLE BUT TO ENABLE 
THAT TO SUPPORT US IN THE WAY THAT WE WANT TO LIVE 
AND THE TWO ARE VERY VERY CLOSELY CONNECTED IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO 
WHEN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING AT THE TIME IT JUST SEEMS NATURAL 
THERE WAS THIS ROCK AND ROLL BAND 
THERE WERE THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE THE SUPPORT SYSTEM TO THE BAND 
THERE WAS A PHILOSOPHY AND LIFESTYLE THAT WE ALL WANTED TO EMBRACE AND IT ALL KIND OF JUST HAPPENED 
IT WASN'T MAPPED OUT ON GRAPH PAPER IT WASN'T SOMETHING 
THAT WAS PLANNED IN ANY SORT OF ORGANISED FASHION YOU JUST DID WHAT YOU DID 
WE GET A LOT OF FEEDBACK INTO THE MUSIC FROM THE PLACE WE LIVE IN 
WHICH YOU WOULDN'T GET LIKE IN THE CITY YOU'D GET SPEEDY AND NEUROTIC MUSIC 
IT'S A MORE ORGANIC THING ALTOGETHER WHICH COMES OUT IN THE MUSIC A MUCH MORE RELAXED ATMOSPHERE 
SO WHAT YOU MEAN SORT OF 
I'M GONNA DANCE ON THE JUDGMENT DAY 
I THINK IT WAS A LOT THROUGH THE CONVENIENCE OF THE FACT 
THAT IF YOU COULD LIVE TOGETHER YOU COULD REHEARSE DAY AND NIGHT 
IF YOU WANTED TO BUT SOMETIMES THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE MIGHT SAY OH GOD YOU CAN STOP YET 
WE'VE DECIDED IT'S A LOT EASIER TO BE OUT IN THE COUNTRY WHICH IS WHY WE'RE LIVING OUT IN NORFOLK 
IT CREATES A MUCH MORE HARMONIC FEEL BOTH WITHIN OURSELVES AND WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT 
LIKE PEOPLE ALWAYS THINK IN TERMS OF THE COUNTRY AS A PLACE TO GO AWAY TO AND DO NOTHING 
IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK LIKE THAT WITH US AT ALL BECAUSE WITHIN THIS SMALL SPACE UNDER THIS ROOF 
THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE ENERGY GOING ON THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE 
DETERMINISM TO DO SOMETHING WHICH WE ALL BELIEVE IN 
AND ERM IT GETS VERY HECTIC AT TIMES 
TEMPERS GET FRAYED AND PEOPLE SAY VERY HEAVY THINGS TO ONE ANOTHER BUT BASICALLY IT'S IT'S GREAT 
EVERYONE IN GLOBAL VILLAGE HAS THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO THE GROUP 
HELGA IS IN CHARGE OF THE WASHING 
THE IDEA IS THAT ALL SHOULD WORK AND PLAY TOGETHER IN PEACE AND HARMONY 
DON'T TREAD TOO HEAVILY ON THAT BIT OF METAL COS YOU'LL GO RIGHT THROUGH IT 
HEY JIMMY DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE HOLE WAS IF I LOOK UP I CAN SEE THE SKY 
IT'S ALL RIGHT I CAN SEE IT YEAH 
PREDICTABLY THE WOMEN DO MOST OF THE HOUSEWORK 
WHILE THE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO KEEP THE PLACE FROM FALLING APART 
THERE'S NOTHING REVOLUTIONARY ABOUT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR 
IF YOU SEE THE SKY DISAPPEAR 
YEAH BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH BIT IT WAS FROM HERE 
CAN'T YOU SEE IT THERE'S A HOLE YOU CAN SEE THE SKY THROUGH IT 
IF I COVER UP THE HOLE YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO SEE IT GOT IT 
THE BAND IS LIKE A VEHICLE THAT ERM THAT PROVIDES A BIT OF MOMENTUM 
TO KEEP US ALL TOGETHER COS IF WE WERE JUST A COMMUNE OF PEOPLE 
THAT WEREN'T REALLY DOING ANYTHING DIDN'T HAVE VERY 
SHARPLY DEFINED AIMS THE WHOLE THING MIGHT CRUMBLE AROUND US 
BUT BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GOING IN A DIRECTION AND THE BAND AND THE MUSIC 
GIVES US THAT DIRECTION ERM WE KNOW IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO DISAPPEAR ONE DAY 
I CAN NO LONGER SEE THE SKY GREAT 
WE WERE PREPARED TO TRY ANYTHING 
WHAT WE KNEW BOTH IN TERMS OF THE MUSIC AND OF THE LIFESTYLE 
WAS THAT THINGS DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THE WAY THEY'D ALWAYS BEEN YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO ERM 
LIVE IN A NUCLEAR FAMILY SITUATION YOU COULD TRY COMMUNAL LIVING AND THAT WAS WONDERFUL 
ERM I'D GO BACK TO THAT IF IT STILL EXISTED I'D LOVE TO LIVE LIKE THAT AGAIN 
HOW MUCH DO THE MEN HELP IN THE BUSINESS OF ACTUALLY RUNNING THE HOUSE 
WE HAVE A ROTA AND THEY ARE ALL SUPPOSED TO DO THEIR SEPARATE JOBS 
THE EASY JOBS LIKE CLEANING THE BATHROOM WHICH JAMES HELPS DANIELLA DO 
JONNY IS SUPPOSED TO DO THE STAIRS 
AND WE ALL HAVE TURNS WASHING UP EVERY DAY AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO KEEP THE KITCHEN TOGETHER ON THAT DAY 
DO ALL THE SWEEPING AND THINGS 
THEY DO HELP A LOT AROUND THE HOUSE LIKE JONNY MENDS THE ROOF AND HE DOES THE ELECTRICITY 
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE HIM HE DID ALL THE WIRING FOR THIS HOUSE 
WHICH WE'D HAVE BEEN LOST WITHOUT 
WE DERIVE OUR BENEFIT FROM LIVING TOGETHER BY WORKING TOGETHER 
BECAUSE IT HELPS GIVE US A FRAMEWORK TO OPERATE IN 
SEE WE LIVE TOGETHER BECAUSE WE LOVE EACH OTHER 
BUT THAT'S NOT WE'RE GIVEN A WAY TO LOVE EACH OTHER BECAUSE WE HAVE TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER 
IT WAS THE PERFECT BLEND OR COULD BE THE PERFECT BLEND 
OF SPIRITUALITY AND ROCK AND ROLL 
ROCK AND ROLL WAS THE VOICE 
IT WAS WHAT YOU DID IF YOU HAD SOMETHING TO SAY AND SOMETHING TO CHANGE 
ONE DAY IT MIGHT HAPPEN 
WHEN YOU'RE LEAST EXPECTING IT 
HEAR A SPACEMAN CALLING YOU 
UPON HIS SILVER SHIP 
I WAS VERY MUCH A PERFORMER AND A FRONT MAN 
I GOT INTO TROUBLE FOR BEING A FRONT MAN AND A PERFORMER 
RATHER THAN A GOOD MEMBER OF THE COMMUNE WE'RE A COMMUNE BAND AND WE'RE ALL IMPORTANT 
I ACTUALLY QUITE LIKED BEING A FRONT MAN AND ENTERTAINING AND YOU CAN'T HELP THAT IF YOU'RE THE SINGER 
BECAUSE THE BAND ARE BASED ON NORFOLK THEY HAVE A STRONG LOCAL FOLLOWING 
THIS GIG IN A DISCO UNDER A NORWICH PUB ATTRACTS ENTHUSIASTIC LOCAL SUPPORT 
YOU KNOW REALLY EARTHY AND THEY PUT ACROSS THE MESSAGE 
OF THE SORT OF GENERATION OF TODAY 
THEY'RE SORT OF A HAPPY GO LUCKY BAND YOU KNOW HOW SO 
YOU KNOW THEY CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE THAT EVERYBODY AGREES WITH YOU KNOW 
SORT OF PLACID 
OUT HERE YOU KNOW IN NORFOLK YOU GET PUT DOWN YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE 
BUT THEY JUST CREATE A LOCAL ATMOSPHERE DON'T THEY YEAH 
EVERYTHING YEAH WE'RE JUST LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT 
THERE'S NO HASSLES THERE'S NO SORT OF PRETENCE 
HOME LIFE IN GLOBAL VILLAGE HAS THE CASUAL INTIMACY OF AN UNUSUALLY RELAXED FAMILY 
A LETTER FROM A FRIEND IS LIKE A LETTER HOME 
JAMES HAS JUST SPOKEN TO JO ON THE TELEPHONE 
I LIKE THE WEDDING AND THE DESCRIPTION OF 
CONGRATULATIONS TO JIMMY AND FREDDIE HIS MUM AND MR. 
AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO FEELS THEY NEED CONGRATULATING 
ON THIS AUSPICIOUS ET CETERA 
THE HOUSE WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN ROOMS ELEVEN OF WHICH WERE BEDROOMS 
THERE WAS A KITCHEN AND A MUSIC ROOM AND A BATHROOM AND TOILET 
EVERY OTHER ROOM IN THE HOUSE WAS A BEDROOM 
COS THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE LIVING THERE 
ALL MY LOVE HAIR AND FINGERNAILS CHOCOLATE O'DWARF AND WENDY 
YOU DON'T GET SERVICE LIKE THIS NORMALLY 
I WAS SIXTEEN SO I WAS QUITE A LOT YOUNGER THAN MOST PEOPLE THERE 
WE ACTUALLY LIVED IN THE OLD COAL HOLE 
YEAH WE HAD THE COAL HOLE WHICH WASN'T FULL OF COAL BUT 
IT USED TO BE WAS IT YEAH IT WAS A COAL HOLE ORIGINALLY I REMEMBER SHOVELLING LOADS OF COAL OUT OF THAT 
LOVELY BEFORE I CAME YES BEFORE I WENT AND GOT YOU 
OH YOU DID MAKE AN EFFORT THEN DIDN'T YOU ABSOLUTELY 
AND THEN WE MOVED NEXT TO THE BAND ROOM WHICH WAS HORRIFIC 
IT WAS A BIGGER BEDROOM NOT MUCH BUT IT WAS BIGGER BEDROOM 
BUT THEY PLAYED ALL NIGHT AND IT WAS REALLY REALLY NOISY IN THERE 
THE MOST ANNOYING WAS SIMON DRUMMING 
BECAUSE HE WOULD PRACTISE SIMON WOULD JUST DRUM ON HIS OWN 
GOING THROUGH HIS RHYTHMS DOING HIS VARIOUS RHYTHMS ALL THE TIME HIS PRACTISING DID GET ANNOYING 
MIKE THERE SHOULD BE A BOWL 
THE GROUP FIND GREAT STRENGTH IN SELF RELIANCE NOT JUST EMOTIONALLY BUT RIGHT DOWN 
TO THE MOST SIMPLE DOMESTIC TASKS LIKE MAKING THEIR OWN BREAD 
BECAUSE OUR SOCIETY HAS GOT SO BIG THERE'S THIS GREAT SENSE OF IMPERSONALITY YOU KNOW 
YOU DON'T REALLY FEEL VERY CLOSE TO SOMEONE BUT IF YOU'RE LIVING WITH PEOPLE ALL THE TIME 
AND YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO THEM ALL THE TIME YOU NEVER SORT OF FEEL THIS INSECURITY 
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE LIVING IN COMMUNES ARE WILD DEGENERATE HIPPIES 
AND THEY THINK I THINK THEY THINK THEY'RE NOT QUITE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS 
I MEAN EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS THIS THING IN THEM THAT EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW 
PART OF THEIR SEARCH FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR A BIT OF SECURITY IS PAIRING UP WITH ONE PERSON 
I'D GOT AWAY FROM MY FAMILY AT THAT TIME 
I WAS STILL QUITE YOUNG MYSELF I'D LEFT HOME I WAS STILL IN TOUCH WITH MY FAMILY BUT I FELT 
I FELT A NEED TO BREAK OUT OF ERM A VERY COMFORTABLE SUBURBAN EXISTENCE AT THAT TIME 
AND ER 
DISCOVER SOME NEW THINGS IN THE WORLD 
WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT PHASE OF YOUR LIFE YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM YOUR OWN FAMILY SOMETIMES 
BUT YOU STILL NEED SOME SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE SO IT WAS MARVELLOUS 
TO FIND PEOPLE WHO WOULD TAKE OVER THAT ROLE 
THE SORT OF STOCK IMAGE OF THE COMMUNE THE ONE THAT WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH 
IS OF THIS SORT OF SCENE OF DEPRAVITY AND EVERYBODY SLEEPING WITH EVERYBODY ELSE 
THAT SORT OF THING HOW IN FACT DOES IT WORK OUT 
I MEAN ALL THE CHICKS HERE ARE FAITHFUL AND ALL THAT YOU KNOW WE ALL SORT OF 
ALL THE CHICKS NEVER SLEEP WITH ANYONE ELSE AS FAR AS I KNOW WELL I DON'T ANYWAY AND ERM 
ALL THE UNATTACHED ONES USUALLY HAVE CHICKS HOME FROM GIGS OR SOMETHING NOT VERY OFTEN THOUGH 
THEY'RE USUALLY FRIENDS THEY'RE NOT SORT OF SORDID OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS WHO HAPPEN TO DIG EACH OTHER A LOT 
AND LOVE EACH OTHER NOT NECESSARILY IN THE WAY YOU LOVE YOUR WIFE OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND 
BUT IN THE FRIEND'S LOVE WAY 
AND THEY THINK IT'S A NICE THING TO DO IT'S REALLY NICE 
VICKY DO YOU THINK AS A MOTHER WITH A CHILD THAT LIVING WITH THIS COMMUNITY ADDS SOMETHING THERE 
OH YES 
BECAUSE WELL WE'VE GOT BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND HE'S GOT 
MOTHERS AND FATHERS BESIDES MYSELF 
AND AS HE HASN'T GOT AN ESTABLISHED FATHER 
HE CAN LEARN SO MUCH MORE FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT FATHERS AND MOTHERS 
AT THAT TIME IT JUST FELT HOW IT SHOULD BE 
THERE WASN'T ANY QUESTION AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED THAT THAT IS HOW 
CERTAINLY I SHOULD LIVE 
I WASN'T SURE ABOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT IT SEEMED SUCH A GOOD WAY 
FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE AND TO SHARE EVERYTHING TO SHARE EVERYTHING 
WE ALL LOVE HIM JUST THE SAME YEAH I MEAN I REALLY LOVE HIM 
HE'S NOT MY BABY REALLY 
NOT BY SORT OF MEDICAL TERMS BUT I MEAN I FEEL JUST AS 
WELL NOT AS MUCH AS MOTHER NOT AS MUCH AS VICKY DOES BUT I FEEL VERY MATERNAL TOWARDS HIM 
YOU KNOW COS HE'S A CHILD IN OUR COMMUNITY 
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT BEING A COMMUNITY THAT IS ALSO A ROCK AND ROLL BAND 
IS THAT YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND DO GIGS 
IT SUITS US TO HAVE A LARGE BUS BECAUSE THAT WAY WE CAN TAKE THE FAMILY WITH US 
AND SO WHEN WE GO OFF TO A GIG THE ROADIES LOAD UP THE GEAR 
THEN EVERYBODY PILES ONTO THE BUS AND WE'VE GOT A HARDCORE AUDIENCE IF YOU LIKE OF PEOPLE 
WHO ARE GOING TO GROOVE ON THE MUSIC ALREADY THERE WITH US TO HELP US GET THE ATMOSPHERE GOING 
GLOBAL VILLAGE SOMETIMES GO OUT ON GIGS WHEN THEY KNOW THEY WON'T GET PAID 
THEY'VE EVEN PLAYED AT NORWICH PRISON FOR FREE 
AND THEY SOMETIMES TRUNDLE THEIR OLD BUS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
TO TURN UP AT A STREET FESTIVAL OR AN OPEN AIR PARTY JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT 
BUT TO KEEP THE FAMILY TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO MAKE MONEY SOMEHOW 
AND TO DO THAT THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL TO WHERE THE WORK IS 
FOR THEM AS FOR MOST GROUPS TRUCKING ROUND THE COUNTRY 
IS A LARGE PART OF THEIR WHOLE WAY OF LIFE 
BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL TOGETHER THEY TRY TO MAKE EVEN THE MOST BORING ASPECTS OF LIFE ENJOYABLE 
TRAVELLING BECOMES A PARTY 
OH OH 
OH OH OH OH OH OH 
OH OH 
WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE OF THE WAY 
THIS IS THE TIME OF TED HEATH THE MINERS' STRIKE THE THREE DAY WEEK 
SO WE WERE ACTUALLY LIVING THROUGH QUITE A POLITICAL TIME IN THIS COUNTRY 
THERE WAS A LOT OF I. R. A. ACTIVITY AND WE WERE CRUISING THROUGH THAT 
AND I THINK IN SOME WAYS WE MAYBE TRIED TO PRETEND WE WEREN'T A PART OF THAT 
DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO 
WELL I BET YOU THAT A LONG TIME ISN'T HAPPY 
YOU HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE TO BLAME 
THE MUSIC IS JUST A MEANS OF PUTTING OUT TO THE PUBLIC WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING AND LIVING 
AS A COMMUNITY IN THE COUNTRY WE'RE BRINGING A BIT OF THE COUNTRY 
TO THE PLACES IN THE CITY THAT WE PLAY LIKE WHEN WE GO TO SOHO 
THOSE PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT A SPACE IS YOU KNOW 
THEY'RE ALL THE TIME HEMMED IN INSIDE SKYSCRAPERS AND CARS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
AND LIKE IF THE MUSIC CAN PORTRAY A BIT OF A DIFFERENT SCENE MAYBE THE OTHER SIDE OF HOW THEY ARE LIVING 
YOU KNOW THAT'S REALLY NICE THAT'S REALLY FUN FOR THOSE PEOPLE IF THEY CAN'T GET THAT ANY OTHER WAY 
CONVINCED OUR DAYS ARE HARD TO COME BY 
YOU AIN'T GOT NO REASON YOU SHOULD CRY 
NO YOU AIN'T GOT NO REASON YOU SHOULD CRY 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LEAVE YOUR PROBLEMS TO PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT 
RATHER THAN TRYING TO WORK IT OUT YOURSELVES 
WE'D NEVER HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER OUR OWN SITUATION SO 
AND WE'VE GOT SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND TO HANDLE THINGS 
AND TAKE DECISIONS ON THINGS IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT TO USE THEM 
THERE'S MORE SATISFACTION YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN YOU GET ALL THOSE LITTLE THINGS 
WHICH REALLY BUG MOST PEOPLE WHEN YOU GET THEM ALL SUSSED OUT AS A GROUP 
YOU JUST GET MORE SATISFACTION WHEN IT ACTUALLY ALL COMES TOGETHER ON TOUR 
YEAH IT'S A GREAT SATISFACTION SEEING AN IDEA FLOW THROUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE AND GRADUALLY MATERIALISE 
INTO SOMETHING CONCRETE YOU KNOW THAT EVERYBODY SUSSES OUT AND THEN TAKES PART IN 
THERE'S A WHOLE FUND OF KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE US ARE GETTING IN ON THEMSELVES 
THE WHOLE EARTH CATALOGUE TYPE OF ATTITUDE 
OF GATHERING DATA AND DOING IT YOURSELF AND LEARNING BY DOING IT 
THE WORLD WAS GOING MAD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE EVERYBODY YOU KNOW 
I'D BEEN DEMONSTRATING AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR IN AUSTRALIA 
AND PEOPLE WERE BURNING THEIR DRAFT CARDS AND RUNNING AWAY 
AND CHANGING THEIR WAY OF LIFE AND PEOPLE WERE NOT GOING TO BECOME BUSINESSMEN 
AND PEOPLE WERE NOT GOING TO GO AND WORK FOR A FIRM 
AND PEOPLE WERE 
YOU WERE ALWAYS GOING TO WORK FOR YOURSELF FOR TRUTH AND BEAUTY 
WHAT IS IT THAT HAPPENED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE'S CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH MAKES THEM 
NO LONGER PREPARED YOU KNOW TO GO THE WAY THAT YOU ALL COULD HAVE GONE 
YOU COULD BE LIVING COMFORTABLY AND INSTEAD WE ARE 
YOU LIVE IN A DRAUGHTY WET DINGY COTTAGE IN THE MIDDLE OF A BLASTED HEATH IN NORFOLK 
IT'S NATURAL I THINK IT'S THE MOST COMFORTABLE PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN 
SPIRITUALLY IT'S MORE COMFORTABLE THAN KANGA 
THAT COMFORT DEPENDS ON EXTERIORS LIKE CENTRAL HEATING AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
COMFORT DOESN'T DEPEND ON THAT AT ALL 
YOU CREATE COMFORT WHEREVER YOU ARE AND WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING 
YOU WISH TO BE COMFORTABLE SO YOU CREATE THAT COMFORT 
BUT PREVIOUSLY EVERYBODY'S BEEN EDUCATED BY CONCERNS 
WHOSE SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT THEY CAN SELL 
PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT TO BELIEVE THAT COMFORT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY PRODUCTS YOU HAVE 
HOW MUCH YOU CONSUME 
BUT A WHOLE LOAD OF PEOPLE BROUGHT UP IN COMFORTABLE MIDDLE CLASS BACKGROUNDS 
GOING THROUGH THE TRAUMAS OF ADOLESCENCE 
SUDDENLY REALISE THAT THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE IN THAT SITUATION 
AND WE'RE SUDDENLY DISCOVERING THAT COMFORT ISN'T DEPENDENT ON 
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKE AND HOW MUCH YOU SPEND BUT HOW YOU FEEL 
MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF GLOBAL VILLAGE AREN'T MUCH GIVEN 
TO DEEP PHILOSOPHISING ABOUT THEIR WAY OF LIFE 
BUT THEY PROBABLY ALL BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE REACHING BACK TO A FEELING FOR THE VITAL RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN MAN AND NATURE A FEELING WHICH THEY BELIEVE IS GROWING IN THE WORLD 
THERE WERE MAGICAL MOMENTS THERE 
BUT A LOT OF THEM MIGHT HAVE BEEN L. S. D. INSPIRED I CAN'T REMEMBER WELL 
BUT I REMEMBER WE USED TO RUN AROUND NAKED IN THE FIELDS 
WHICH WAS VERY ENJOYABLE I SEEM TO REMEMBER 
I REMEMBER VICKY'S PARENTS TURNING UP WHEN I WAS WANDERING AROUND NAKED 
THEY WERE A BIT SHOCKED THEY DROVE UP IN THEIR CAR I SEEM TO REMEMBER THAT 
THIS FEELING IS SOMETHING THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AROUND AND IF ONE LOSES TOUCH 
WITH THAT FLOW OF LIFE THEN ONE ENDS UP IN A VERY SORT OF STERILE SITUATION 
WHICH I THINK YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES IN TODAY 
SO WHAT DOES GLOBAL VILLAGE DO TO REDRESS THE BALANCE 
WELL WE'RE JUST ONE OF A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE FELT 
SOMETHING ABOUT A SORT OF NEW VIBRATION OR ATMOSPHERE IN THE AIR IT'S AFFECTING EVERYONE REALLY 
AND COULD YOU PUT THAT INTO WORDS WHAT THAT IS 
THAT FEELING THOSE AIMS 
I SUPPOSE IT'S MORE A MEMORY OR 
A FLASH OF SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY HAPPEN YOU KNOW 
THAT THIS WORLD COULD BE A BETTER PLACE AND CAN BE A BETTER PLACE IF EVERYONE GETS DOWN AND TRIES TO PUT 
SOMETHING WHICH IS ONLY A DREAM INTO REALITY 
MAY DAY IN OXFORD 
A FESTIVAL FOR GLOBAL VILLAGE 
THIS IS MAY THE FIRST AND IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF SUMMER 
AND THEREFORE IT'S AN OCCASION FOR A BIT OF CELEBRATION 
A BIT OF DANCING AND SINGING AND GETTING OUT IN THE STREETS AND GETTING IT ON GENERALLY 
AND PERHAPS A LITTLE SENSE OF RITUAL AS WELL 
THE FACT THAT SUMMER'S COMING IS STILL A THING TO DANCE AND SING ABOUT 
ONCE UPON A TIME EVERYBODY JOINED IN THIS CELEBRATION IT'S A VERY TRADITIONAL THING 
IN THOSE DAYS I GUESS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MEDIEVAL FAIR 
TODAY WHEN YOU WANT TO DO THAT WITH A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE AROUND YOU HAVE A ROCK FESTIVAL 
LAST YEAR IT WAS THE START OF THE BAND AS WELL IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GIGS THE BAND EVER DID 
AND WE CAME TO BE SO CLOSELY ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER IN OXFORD THAT WE'VE GOT IT ON AGAIN THIS YEAR 
O. K. I GIVE YOU GLOBAL VILLAGE TRUCKING COMPANY ALL YOURS 
THEY KNOW THEY MAY NOT STAY TOGETHER FOREVER BUT FOR THEM IT'S NOW THAT COUNTS THE MUSIC IS THE MESSAGE 
IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND IT WE CAN BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE ON ABOUT 
WELL 
I BUST IN AND OUT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES 
LIKE A REPETITIOUS BALLOON 
LET ME EXPLAIN YOU SEE I ENTERTAIN 
I'M A READY MADE BABOON 
I'M GONNA BE DANCIN' ON JUDGMENT DAY 
I AM WHOA 
I'M GONNA BE DANCIN' ON JUDGMENT DAY 
THERE WAS PROBABLY A SHELF LIFE FOR THE BAND IF YOU LIKE 
IT WAS DESTINED TO DO WHAT IT DID OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN IT PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE 
THE RIGHT INTERNAL DYNAMIC TO SURVIVE A SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIAL CAREER 
ONCE I USED TO SIT AROUND AND SULK FOR HOURS 
AS I RECALL IT IT WAS MIKE WHO WAS THE FIRST ONE TO SAY 
LOOK I'M JUST STANDING UP ON STAGE AGAIN AND I JUST CAN'T THINK WHAT I'M DOING HERE 
IT'S BEEN LAUGHTER SINGIN' MUSIC ALL THE WAY 
I'M GONNA BE DANCING ON JUDGMENT DAY 
I WAS GOING THROUGH A PHASE WHERE I WAS DEFINITELY LOSING CONFIDENCE ABOUT PLAYING 
AND I WASN'T ENJOYING IT I WAS GETTING A BIT OF STAGE FRIGHT OR SOMETHING 
I WASN'T ACTUALLY ENJOYING BEING ON THE ROAD THAT MUCH 
BECAUSE WE WERE GOING UP AND DOWN THE M. ONE 
GOING TO BIRMINGHAM AND ABERDEEN AND LANCASHIRE 
AND THESE WERE BORING PLACES AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED 
AND I WAS NOW LIKE TWENTY FIVE AND I THOUGHT I WANNA SEE THE WORLD YOU KNOW 
AND I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE THIS BAND WILL SEE THE WORLD 
I'M GONNA BE DANCIN' ON JUDGMENT DAY 
I TALKED TO A COUPLE OF MUSICIANS AND ASKED THEM 
WHAT'S AMERICA LIKE COS I WAS QUITE INTERESTED I HAD NEVER BEEN ABROAD REALLY APART FROM FRANCE 
THE GUY SAID I DON'T KNOW BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE HOLIDAY INN'S LIKE 
AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW WE WERE IN A BUBBLE ALREADY BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO GO ROUND THE WORLD IN A BUBBLE 
AND ERM I LEFT THE BAND 
I'M GONNA BE DANCIN' ON JUDGMENT DAY 
YEAH YEAH 
A BIT OF THE HEART WENT OUT OF IT WHEN MICHAEL LEFT AND WENT TO BRAZIL 
WHEN I GOT TO BRAZIL I THINK I GOT MORE INTO A HEDONISTIC SITUATION TO BE QUITE HONEST 
AND YOU KNOW THIS SPIRITUAL SEARCH I THINK WAS KIND OF LIKE PUT ON HOLD 
BECAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY HAVING QUITE AN INTENSE TIME PLAYING AND GROOVING 
AND DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT WANNA DO WHEN YOU'RE A YOUNG GUY IN BRAZIL 
AFTER ABOUT THREE OR FOUR YEARS I SUDDENLY FELT A BIT EMPTY HEADED AND I SUDDENLY STARTED TO WANT 
TO KNOW MORE AGAIN ABOUT HOW YOU TICK NOT NECESSARILY FROM A SPIRITUAL POINT OF VIEW 
MORE FROM A. JUST HOW IT WORKS SO I DECIDED TO READ UP ON NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AT THAT TIME 
THAT SOUNDS CRAZY BUT I REALISED THAT I COULDN'T ACTUALLY READ THOSE BOOKS 
WITHOUT KNOWING ABOUT SOME BASIC CHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEMISTRY 
SO I WENT THROUGH THIS WHOLE STUDY OF ALL THESE THINGS FROM ATOMS UP TO BIOCHEMISTRY 
ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO READ THESE BOOKS 
AND THIS WAS ALL ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHAT NEUROPHYSIOLOGISTS THOUGHT ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS 
THAT HAD A LOT OF INFLUENCE ON ME AND I STARTED READING THESE BOOKS 
AND THAT'S WHERE HOLOGRAPHY WAS MENTIONED I STARTED TO GET INTERESTED IN HOLOGRAPHY 
BASICALLY I HAVE TO HAVE AN OBSESSION OR I JUST WANT TO DIE SO BASICALLY I HAD TO COMBINE 
WHATEVER SMALL TALENTS I'VE GOT IN ART OR SCIENCE OR WHATEVER 
AND COMBINE IT INTO THE SYNTHESIS THAT IS WHAT HOLOGRAPHY DEMANDS 
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS KEPT ME IF YOU LIKE GETTING UP IN THE MORNING REALLY 
I'M USING THIS VERY OLD COMPUTER YOU CAN SEE HERE 
IT'S REALLY GOOD FOR THE JOB BUT WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT TO WARM UP A BIT 
OH YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG ONE THERE 
YEP AND THEN YOU CAN JUST USE THE SHUTTER LIKE THAT RIGHT 
YOU CAN SEE THE LASER BEAMS GOING ROUND THESE OPTICS HERE 
AND ERM BECAUSE WE'RE DOING ANIMATED HOLOGRAMS 
WHICH ISN'T THE ONLY KIND OF HOLOGRAMS WE DO BUT YOU CAN SEE THE FILM PROJECTOR HERE 
IT PROJECTS ONTO THE SCREEN AND IT PROJECTS SEQUENTIAL FRAMES ON TO THAT SCREEN 
WHICH IS THEN RECORDED BY THE HOLOGRAM AS SEQUENTIAL FRAMES AND STORED 
SO YOU SEE SEQUENTIAL FRAMES AS YOU WALK PAST THE HOLOGRAM 
DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA WORK 
YES I THINK IT DOES YOU'VE GOT TO STAND RIGHT BACK THOUGH HAVEN'T YOU YEAH 
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON YEAH IT'S A HUGE ANIMATION ISN'T IT 
THE MORE THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT LOTS OF THINGS THE MORE YOU CAN DO IN HOLOGRAPHY 
AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T GET ONE BIT OF THE BRAIN 
IT'S NOT LIKE DOING IT OR COMPUTERS WHERE JUST ONE BIT OF THE BRAIN IS YOU KNOW 
THAT'S WHY I LIKE IT AND ALSO BECAUSE I CAN DRIFT OFF AND IMAGINE 
YOU KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT HOLOGRAPHY'S ABOUT IN TERMS OF COSMOLOGY AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
SO THAT'S WHY I FIND IT QUITE A COMPLETE SORT OF AREA FOR ME 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT IT READ ALL ABOUT IT READ ALL ABOUT IT WHILE YOU CAN 
OH S. N. FIFTY EIGHT 
ER I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S GONNA BE ABOUT FIFTY PEOPLE AND A DOG 
OR WHETHER THERE ARE GONNA BE PEOPLE FLOWING ONTO LEYTONSTONE HIGH ROAD 
I DON'T KNOW COS WE HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA 
ALL RIGHT BOYS 
I'M JUST CONCERNED TO MAKE SURE THAT ERM WE'RE PLAYING O. K. 
WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE REHEARSAL SIMON HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT THIS GIG 
I THOUGHT I'D ASKED A QUESTION FOR YOU I'M FEELING NUMB 
HE'S COMFORTABLY NUMB I LOVE TO BE NUMB 
JAMES GOOD MAN HOW ARE YOU DOING 
GOD WATCH OUT HE'S STARTED SCHMOOZING 
NO BUT THANKS FOR GIVING US THE GIG AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE MAN THAT'S NOT EASY 
WE'VE ALREADY DONE ALL THAT WELL I HAVEN'T DONE IT HAVE I 
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHO WE ARE HE'S THE ORGANIST BY THE WAY O. K. COOL 
OOH IS THAT WHAT I AM TO YOU AN ORGANIST 
BLOODY HELL AFTER ALL THESE YEARS 
THAT'S WHAT I GET AN ORGANIST 
THERE ISN'T EVEN SUCH A WORD 
YOU CREATE COMFORT WHEREVER YOU ARE WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING 
YOU WISH TO BE COMFORTABLE SO YOU CREATE THAT COMFORT 
PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT TO BELIEVE THAT COMFORT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY PRODUCTS YOU HAVE HOW MUCH YOU CONSUME 
THIS ONE 
YEAH THAT'LL DO THAT ONE OR THE OTHER ONE THAT ONE'S BETTER 
LIFT THAT UP A SECOND IT'LL FIT UNDER THERE 
IN A SENSE IT LOOKS LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE 
LEFT OUT OF THE ORIGINAL GROUP WHO'S 
STILL LIVING COMMUNALLY THIS PLACE IS SIMILAR IT'S A SCHOOL 
AND EVERYBODY HERE IS A STUDENT OF THE SCHOOL STAFF PRINCIPAL GARDENERS 
EVERYBODY IS A STUDENT OF THE SCHOOL 
EVERYBODY WORKS TOWARDS A SINGLE AIM AND SO I SEE IT AS A LOGICAL CONTINUATION 
OF WHY WE WERE ALL LIVING TOGETHER WHY WE HAD THE BAND WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO EXPRESS 
WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO AND THIS IS IT 
WE'RE GOING TO STUDY NUMBER SIX IT STARTS IN LIKE MANNER 
O. K. READY 
WELL HE SAID MAY GOD SANCTIFY HIS SECRET IN THE MATHNAVI 
IF THAT THOUGHT TO BE A ROSE THOU ART A ROSE BOUQUET 
IF IT BE A THORN THOU ART FUEL FOR THE FIRE 
BESHARA SCHOOL OF INTENSIVE ESOTERIC EDUCATION 
NOW THAT'S A KIND OF A HUGE THING TO TALK ABOUT 
BUT ESSENTIALLY EDUCATION IS ABOUT DRAWING OUT WHAT'S INSIDE OF EACH PERSON 
THAT'S WHAT THE PLACE IS FOR HERE 
EXISTENCE IS ONE AND EVERYTHING PARTICIPATES IN THAT ACCORDING TO ITSELF 
AND ONE IS INFORMED ABOUT REALITY BY REALITY ITSELF 
THE SCHOOL EXISTS TO HELP PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO LISTEN 
AND LOOK AND WATCH THE REALITY UNFOLDING ITSELF IN FRONT OF THEM 
MY WHOLE LIFE IS A SEARCH FOR TRUTH 
AND THE GLOBAL VILLAGE TRUCKING COMPANY WAS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT STEP ON THE WAY 
JUST BECAUSE THAT SHAPE AND FRAME THAT WAS THE GLOBAL VILLAGE TRUCKING COMPANY HAS FALLEN AWAY 
IT DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH STOPS 
YOU KEEP WALKING YOU CARRY ON 
LET ME SEE LET ME SEE RIGHT I'LL START DOING ONE THEN 
I PRINTED THEM OUT THAT'S FINE THAT'S GOOD 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO TAPE ALL THE TUNES WE DO 
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING YOU'RE BUZZING 
I'VE GOT HERE AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL 
COS NORMALLY I USED TO SET UP SIMON'S DRUMS 
HE USED TO HAVE THEM STONED ROADIE PROOF SO I COULD SET THEM UP IN WHATEVER CONDITION I WAS IN 
AND I COULD JUST SET THE WHOLE DRUM KIT UP AND HE WOULD COME IN AND ADJUST THE SNARE DRUM 
IF WE WERE LUCKY AND THAT WAS THAT 
BRILLIANT THAT'S EXCELLENT YEAH I'VE TIMED IT TO PERFECTION 
CONGRATULATIONS TO JIMMY AND FREDDIE HIS MUM 
AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO FEELS THEY NEED CONGRATULATING ON THIS AUSPICIOUS ET CETERA 
ALL MY LOVE HAIR AND FINGERNAILS CHOCOLATE O'DWARF AND WENDY 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT AND YOU LOOK AT HOW YOUNG WE WERE 
ESPECIALLY ME I MEAN SIXTEEN HOW MANY PEOPLE 
MUMMY WAS SIXTEEN AND I WAS TWENTY ONE HOW OLD WERE YOU TWENTY ONE I WAS TWENTY ONE 
IT'S RARE ISN'T IT WE'RE THE ONLY ONES OUT OF EVERYBODY WHO'S STILL TOGETHER 
THAT IS IMPRESSIVE 
YEAH I MEAN I WAS SUPER YOUNG BUT I'D ALSO BEEN A BIT OF A WILD KID SO 
NOT BAD OR ANYTHING BUT I'D LIVED QUITE A LIFE YOU'D LIVED QUITE A LOT FOR YOUR AGE 
I THINK I'M QUITE PROUD OF THEM REALLY 
IT SEEMED VERY EXCITING 
I'M QUITE IMPRESSED THAT MY MUM WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST PERSON NAKED ON TELEVISION 
THE FIRST NAKED PERSON ON T. V. THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE AT LEAST IN THIS COUNTRY 
AS LONG AS NO ONE MUCH SEES IT OH I WAS SO BEAUTIFUL 
I WOULDN'T DO IT NOW I CAN ASSURE YOU 
BUT I KNOW MY GRANDMOTHER COMPLETELY DISOWNED ME BECAUSE I WAS NAKED 
IN THE BATH 
NAKED IN THE BATH WITH A HIPPY NO IT WAS ACTUALLY QUITE 
MY PARENTS WERE O. K. ABOUT IT I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER 
BUT MY GRANDMOTHER WOULDN'T SPEAK TO ME FOR YEARS 
I THINK IT'S SERIOUSLY EMBARRASSING SOME OF IT I MUST SAY 
I'M MORE EMBARRASSED ABOUT WHAT I SAID THAN WHAT I LOOKED LIKE 
I FEEL SO AFFECTED THE WAY THAT I WAS SAYING CHICK AND DIG AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
BUT IT WAS THE TIME THAT'S THE WAY PEOPLE SPOKE 
AND IT'S LIKE THE WAY PEOPLE TALK NOW YOU'D ALL DIE OF EMBARRASSMENT IF ERM 
IF PEOPLE KNEW HOW YOU BEHAVED AS A TEENAGER SAYING LATERS AND SKANK AND WHATEVER 
INNIT RUDE BOY YEAH IT DOESN'T TRAVEL WELL OVER THE YEARS 
BUT MY ROSY PICTURE AND MEMORY OF IT 
WAS THAT WE LIVED IN THIS IDYLLIC BEAUTIFUL COTTAGE 
IN A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL PLACE AND IT LOOKS HORRIBLE 
THE KITCHEN LOOKS SO MANKY IT WAS REALLY 
AND THAT WE ALL LOOKED BEAUTIFUL I THOUGHT I LOOKED BEAUTIFUL I NEVER BRUSHED MY HAIR 
I THINK YOU DID LOOK BEAUTIFUL 
I THINK THE TIME WE WERE THERE WAS SUCH AN IMPORTANT MOMENT IN TIME 
BUT ALSO WE MET EACH OTHER AND LOVED EACH OTHER 
WE FELL IN LOVE TOGETHER AND WE'RE STILL TOGETHER ABSOLUTELY BUT I DO THINK THAT THE TIME WAS 
MORALLY IT WAS A VERY GOOD TIME 
I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT IT MOULDED ME TO SOME EXTENT 
YEAH WHAT WE LEARNED THERE FROM THE COMMUNE LIVING WITH OTHER PEOPLE INTERACTING 
AND WE SHARED EVERYTHING I THINK WE ARE HIPPIES 
WE'LL ALWAYS BE HIPPIES YES IT'S IN MY HEART IT TOTALLY IS 
YOU KNOW WE LIVE IN QUITE A COMMUNAL WAY NOW EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE LIVING WITH US 
BUT IF YOU THINK OF THE FACT THAT THE KIDS ARE STILL LIVING AT HOME 
AND THEY BRING THEIR FRIENDS ROUND AS WELL YEAH A FLOW OF FRIENDS 
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A VERY BUSY HOUSE 
I THINK WE ALWAYS HAD THE COOLEST PARENTS AROUND THANK YOU 
THANK YOU DARLING 
WELL I MEAN 
I THINK THERE ARE ELEMENTS WHERE WE FELT A BIT 
I FELT A BIT STRAIGHT LACED IN COMPARISON THE SAFFY TO THE EDINA KIND OF THING 
WHAT WITH GETTING A GOOD EDUCATION AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF BUT THEN AGAIN 
I THINK THAT WAS ENCOURAGED AS WELL SO I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE 
THERE WEREN'T MANY WAYS TO REBEL LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH NEED TO EITHER 
BECAUSE WE COULD PRETTY MUCH DO WHATEVER WE LIKED 
LET'S GET SOME PROPER SOUND JON GET THE LINE CHECK 
EXCUSE ME 
WE'RE ALL BLOODY LOUD ACTUALLY 
WE'RE ALL INCREDIBLY LOUD 
RIGHT ARE YOU READY 
LET'S GO 
I BUST IN AND OUT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES 
LIKE A REPETITIOUS BALLOON 
LET ME EXPLAIN YOU SEE I ENTERTAIN 
I'M A READY MADE BABOON 
AND IT'S LAUGHTER SINGING MUSIC ALL THE WAY 
AND I'M GONNA BE DANCIN' ON THE JUDGMENT DAY 
I'M GONNA BE DANCIN' ON THE JUDGMENT DAY YEAH 
IT SOUNDS GREAT 
A BIT MORE BASS IF ANYTHING 
MORE BASS YEAH YEAH I THINK SO 
OUR AIMS ARE TO MAKE IT TO GET THE MUSIC AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE AND TO GET IT OUT TO AS MANY PEOPLE 
BUT TO ENABLE THAT TO SUPPORT US IN THE WAY THAT WE WANNA LIVE AND THE TWO ARE VERY VERY CLOSELY CONNECTED 
RIGHT CHEERS BYE 
GLOBAL VILLAGE WAS THE STARTING POINT PRETTY MUCH OF MY ADULT LIFE 
AND BY SORT OF ACCIDENT MY WORKING LIFE 
I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO CONTINUE WORKING IN AND EARNING A LIVING OUT OF MUSIC 
WHICH YOU KNOW WAS ONE OF MY GREAT PASSIONS AS A KID 
SO I'M ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES IN THAT RESPECT 
AND I'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR THIRTY 
BASICALLY SINCE THAT PROGRAMME THIRTY FIVE YEARS OR MORE WORKING IN THE MUSIC WORLD 
FROM THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH HER 
THE ISSUE IS JUST GONNA BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE DEAL 
YOU KNOW AND WHETHER 
RIGHT O. K. 
YEAH 
I THINK A LOT OF THE THOUGHTS THAT I HAD THEN I STILL HAVE 
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE'S TIMES WHEN 
THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THE MUSIC BUSINESS HAS ACTUALLY HELPED 
AND ASSISTED ARTISTS AND TIMES THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY HINDERED AND NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THEM 
I KNOW WHICH SIDE OF THE LINE I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO STAY ON AND I DON'T THINK THAT NEEDS 
TO BE AFFECTED BY WHERE YOU ACTUALLY FIND YOURSELF IN TERMS OF 
WHAT JOB YOU MAY HAVE AT ANY PARTICULAR MOMENT 
YOU STILL CAN STAY TRUE TO YOUR IDEALS 
OUR WHOLE HOUSEHOLD IS A SELF CONTAINED WORKING UNIT 
WHICH INCLUDES ALL PEOPLE WHO HELP GET THE SHOW ON THE ROAD LIKE THE ROADIES 
THE MANAGERS AND THEN ALL PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES LIKE BACK AT THE HOUSE DOING THE DOMESTIC THINGS 
AND IT'S ALL LIKE A SORT OF GREAT BIG FAMILY AND A WORKING TEAM ALL IN ONE 
WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IN THE FILM WASN'T ACTUALLY IN TRUTH A REALITY WE COULD HAVE LIVED 
YOU COULDN'T HAVE SUSTAINED THAT BAND OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME 
WITHOUT ENGAGING WITH A RECORD COMPANY 
A RECORD WAS WHAT WAS GONNA SPREAD THE WORD AND THE INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE RECORD 
WAS WHAT WAS GONNA SPREAD THE WORD QUICKEST AND MOST EFFECTIVELY 
NOW THANKS TO TECHNOLOGY BANDS ARE ABLE IN A WAY THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR SO 
TO BE A LOT MORE SELF SUFFICIENT SELF DETERMINED THROUGH YOU KNOW 
THE ONLINE WORLD AND BEING ABLE TO BUILD AN AUDIENCE ONLINE 
WITHOUT HAVING TO ENGAGE WITH A BIG CORPORATION 
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE THAT SITUATION GROWING MORE AND MORE AS WE LOOK FORWARD 
TO THE OLD KIND OF RECORD COMPANY DOMINATED MUSIC SCENE STARTING TO CRUMBLE 
AND IT WILL START TO REINVENT ITSELF 
WHILST YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT NO ONE QUITE KNOWS WHICH WAY TO LOOK 
SOME PEOPLE ARE SCARED BY IT SOME PEOPLE ARE EXCITED BY THE POSSIBILITIES IT THROWS UP 
I THINK I'M IN THE LATTER CAMP OF THOSE TWO 
NOW IF THIS COUNTRY OR THIS WORLD EVER REACHES A POINT OF 
SOME KIND OF CRISIS AND EVERYBODY'S VERY 
WE NEVER TALK ABOUT IT BUT EVERYBODY'S THINKING THIS MAY HAPPEN ONE DAY 
EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE WE'VE GOT EACH OTHER 
AT THE TIME I THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS BEING 
NOT PARTICULARLY GOOD LOOKING BUT VERY VERY CLEVER 
AND THEN LOOKING BACK AT THE FILM 
ER I HAD THE OPPOSITE IMPRESSION 
I THOUGHT OH I WAS BETTER LOOKING THAN I REALISED AT THE TIME BUT SO STUPID 
HOPEFULLY WISER NOW 
B. A. D. A. B. A. B. A. B. A. B. A. 
I WOULD HAVE LIKED FOR THE BAND TO HAVE MADE IT TO ERM 
A MORE SUCCESSFUL RECORDING CAREER BECAUSE THAT WAS ALWAYS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO FOR THEM 
AND I WAS FRUSTRATED IN WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO 
BECAUSE EVERY TIME I'D GET THEM A POTENTIAL RECORD DEAL 
THEY WOULD TURN IT DOWN ON THE BASIS THAT THEY DIDN'T WANNA SELL OUT 
TO THE INDUSTRY WHICH HAD A VERY BAD NAME AT THAT TIME FOR EXPLOITING MUSICIANS 
YOU COULD SAY THAT ER THAT WAS THEIR UNDOING 
BECAUSE THEY WOULD NEVER TAKE A RECORD DEAL 
I SUPPOSE IT IS IRONIC THAT I'M STILL TRUCKING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS 
I ALWAYS ENJOYED THE TRAVELLING ASPECT OF IT AND THAT'S REALLY WHY I DO THIS JOB NOW 
I DID VARIOUS DIFFERENT THINGS FOR A WHILE 
BUT ENDED UP GETTING MY HGV LICENCE AND DRIVING A TRUCK ERM AND THEN GOING ON TOUR WITH VARIOUS BANDS 
I'VE WORKED FOR LOTS OF FAMOUS PEOPLE 
THE ROLLING STONES PAUL MCCARTNEY BOB DYLAN DAVID BOWIE ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT 
I NEVER HAD SUCH A GOOD EXPERIENCE AS THAT THOUGH 
BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THOSE TIMES 
NOTHING EVER QUITE MATCHED IT 
IF YOU'RE ON TOUR WITH A BAND IT'S THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD 
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN LITTLE HOME WITH YOU ALL THE TIME 
THE OTHERS ARE IN AND OUT OF HOTEL ROOMS AND AEROPLANES AND SLEEPING ON BUSES 
ALL CRAMMED TOGETHER AND I HAVE MY OWN FOUR STAR LUXURY SUITE 
I CAN JUST DRAW THE CURTAINS AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN IT'S ALL BEEN TOO MUCH 
AND I'M IN THE SAME PLACE EVERY NIGHT 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN GATHERED TOGETHER FROM THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE GLOBE 
BRINGING YOU THEIR UNIQUE BRAND OF RETRO CUTTING EDGE I GIVE YOU GLOBAL VILLAGE TRUCKING COMPANY 
LOOK INTO THE NIGHT 
YOU CAN SEE A STAR 
LOOK INTO THE NIGHT 
YOU CAN SEE HOW FAR AWAY IT IS 
LOOK INTO THE DAY 
YOU CAN SEE THE SUN 
LOOK INTO THE DAY 
YOU CAN SEE ANYONE THAT YOU WANT TO 
LOOK INTO MY EYES ONE WILL SEE YOUR FACE 
I KEEP IT WITH ME ALL THE TIME 
LOOK INTO MY HEART AND I FIND YOURSELF 
I CAN'T SEEM TO LEAVE YOUR MEMORY BEHIND 
EVEN THOUGH I KEEP ON TRYING 
I CAN'T SEEM TO LEAVE YOUR MEMORY BEHIND 
OH NO NO 
I CAN'T SEEM TO LEAVE YOUR MEMORY BEHIND 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE TRUTH IS I MEAN IT SOUNDS FACETIOUS 
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU ASK 
AND THEY WILL SAY JON OWEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN A ROCK AND ROLL STAR 
EXCEPT A HE DIDN'T LIKE GOING OUT AT NIGHT AND B. HE NEVER REMEMBERED THE WORDS 
I'M GONNA BE DANCIN' ON JUDGMENT DAY 
IT WASN'T REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME TO BE FAMOUS 
IT WAS QUITE AN IMPORTANT THING TO ME TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A LIVING 
ONE DAY IT MIGHT HAPPEN 
WHEN YOU'RE LEAST EXPECTING IT 
WHAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME WHEN I WAS WORKING 
WITH THE GLOBS IF YOU LIKE WAS ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE I MET ON THE ROAD 
THE PEOPLE I MET AT BOXMOOR HALL THOSE GUYS FROM NORWICH 
I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO SAY 
THAT'S LED ON TO WHAT I DO NOW I WORK WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
I WORK WITH SMALL BABIES I WORK WITH PENSIONERS 
I WORK WITH YOUNG SHALL WE SAY YOUNG PEOPLE DISADVANTAGED 
YOU KNOW I'VE MADE A CAREER OUT OF USING MUSIC ER 
WITH MARGINALISED GROUPS OF PEOPLE 
I WAS EIGHT WHEN I CAME HERE 
I HAD TO SAY GOODBYE TO GEORGE I CAME HERE WITH MY BROTHER 
I SAID WHERE'S HE GOING 
THEY SAID IF YOU WANT TO SEE HIM YOU CAN 
WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING NOW I SAY I HANG AROUND PEOPLE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
I'M A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN AND COMPOSER AND WHAT I CALL 
AN ARTISTIC ADVOCATE IN THE FACT THAT I USE MY SKILLS 
IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY GET WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO SAY OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANNA HEAR IT 
I WAS EIGHT WHEN I CAME HERE 
I HAD TO SAY GOODBYE TO GEORGE I CAME HERE WITH MY BROTHER 
I BECAME MORE OF A CONDUIT FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS AND I LIKE IT 
IT'S LIKE MUSICAL DOCUMENTARY 
I HAD TO SAY GOODBYE TO GEORGE 
I CAME HERE WITH MY BROTHER I SAID WHERE'S HE GOING 
HAVING SAID THAT DON'T SAY THERE'S NOT A SELFISH MOTIVE IN IT 
BECAUSE I'M ALSO WORKING WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
AND MY CREATIVITY ACTUALLY COMES FROM THEM AS WELL PEOPLE SAY 
DON'T YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF JON 
COS I DON'T REALLY WRITE MANY SONGS ANY MORE UNLESS SOMEBODY ASKS ME TO 
BUT I SAY BUT THIS HAS BECOME SO MUCH INGRAINED THAT MY ART MY COMPOSITION MY MUSIC IS THAT 
I'M HERE WITH MY BROTHER 
I SAID WHERE'S HE GOING 
I DO IT COS I REALLY ENJOY IT 
AND IT'S WHAT I DO I GET A REAL BUZZ OUT OF IT 
IN SOME WAYS THAT'S YOUR SUBSTITUTE FOR BEING A PERFORMER 
WHEN A FRIEND YOU'VE HAD A LONG TIME ISN'T HAPPY 
YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE TO BLAME 
DO YOU SHRUG YOUR SHOULDERS 
MUTTER C'EST LA VIE 
HOW CAN YOU REIGNITE A DYING FLAME 
DO YOU SHOW CONCERN FOR THAT SOMEBODY 
WONDER WHAT CAN MAKE THEM FEEL SO BAD 
WHEN YOU GOT A GOOD FRIEND 
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN 
YOU SHOULD CHERISH EVERYONE YOU HAVE 
WE'LL DO THAT TWICE LADS 
YES YOU SHOULD CHERISH EVERYONE YOU HAVE 
SEE WHEN THE GLOBS PLAY IT'S NOT JUST PLAYING IT'S LIKE A FAMILY 
IT'S LIKE YOUR BLOODY DEADHEADS WELL THESE ARE THE GLOBHEADS IT'S LIKE A FAMILY 
EVERYBODY NEEDS A GOOD FRIEND SOMETIME 
YES AND SOMETIMES THEIR LIFE 
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE I MEAN IT'S A LONG TIME AGO 
WHO THIS MEANS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT TO COS IT WAS LIKE A MOMENT 
A FEW YEARS IN TIME WHICH WAS REALLY PROFOUND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 
BUT TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A BRAND NEW START 
TRY VERY HARD NOT TO BE BLUE 
UP UP UP 
THEY WERE FANTASTIC ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
YOU HAVE TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO IT AGAIN 
AND NOT WAIT THIRTY FIVE YEARS FOR THE NEXT ONE COS I'LL BE DEAD THEN 
NO IT'S BRILLIANT ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
ONE MORE TIME FOR EVERYBODY 
HE COULD MAY 
HE COULD MAYBE OOH OOH 
HE COULD MAY OOH OOH 
HE COULD MAYBE USE A GOOD FRIEND TOO 
WHOA YEAH 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING

IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
