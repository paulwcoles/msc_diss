THIS IS B. B. C. WORLD NEWS TODAY WITH 
ME 
RELIEF TRICKLES 
IN TO 
STRICKEN 
SURVIVORS OF BURMA'S CYCLONE 
DISASTER BUT THE SECRETIVE 
MILITARY JUNTA HOLDS UP THOUSANDS 
OF TONNES OF AID AT THE BORDER 
COULD THE UN 
SOMEHOW BYPASS 
THE 
GENERALS 
AND FORCE 
THROUGH AID AND 
RELIEF WORKERS 
I AM DISAPPOINTED 
WITH THE PROGRESS SINCE I SPOKE TO 
YESTERDAY YESTERDAY PROTESTS IN LEBANON ERUPT INTO 
ARMED CONFLICT THE OPPOSITION 
HEZBOLLAH THREATEN ALL OUT WAR AND 
THE ARMY WARNS ITS SOLDIERS MIGHT 
BREAK DOWN ALONG SECTARIAN LINES 
FLY PASTS IN ISRAEL AS PEOPLE 
CELEBRATE 
THE SIXTIETH 
ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE STATE'S TROUBLED FOUNDING WE 
REPORT FROM JERUSALEM ON THE 
NATION'S MOOD 
AND WASTE NOT WANT NOT BILLIONS 
IN THE BIN WHY BRITISH HOUSEHOLDS 
ARE THROWING AWAY TEN BILLION WORTH 
OF GOOD FOOD EVERY YEAR 
HELLO AND WELCOME NEARLY A WEEK 
AFTER BURMA'S DEVASTATING CYCLONE 
SURVIVORS ARE LEFT TO SCAVENGE 
THOUSANDS OF CORPSES FLOAT IN 
RIVERS THREATENING TO POLLUTE 
WATER SUPPLIES AID AGENCIES SAY 
EVERY HOUR GOING BY IS AN HOUR 
WASTED FOR THE ONE MILLION NEEDY 
SURVIVORS WHAT BY NOW SHOULD BE A 
MAJOR RELIEF OPERATION HAS GOT 
UNDER WAY IN FITS AND STARTS THE 
FIRST UN PLANE LOAD HAS REACHED 
RANGOON AND RELIEF SUPPLIES FROM 
FRIENDLY NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES ARE 
BEING ALLOWED IN HOWEVER U. S. 
MILITARY AIRCRAFT CARRYING HELP ARE 
BEING DENIED ACCESS AND SOME OF 
THE WORST HIT AREAS ARE CUT OFF 
ANDREW HARDING HAS MORE 
BURMESE MONKS HELP CLEAR A PATH 
THROUGH THE WRECKAGE AN AMATEUR 
AID OPERATION IN A COUNTRY WHERE A 
MILLION SURVIVORS ARE STILL WAITING 
FOR OUTSIDE HELP TO POUR IN HERE 
DEEP IN THE IRRAWADDY DELTA THE 
DESTRUCTION IS OVERWHELMING 
DESPERATE FAMILIES TRUDGING THROUGH 
THE MUD LOOKING FOR WATER AND 
SHELTER BUT THERE IS NOT MUCH OF 
BY THEY GET ANOTHER WEARY FAMILY 
WAITS FOR HELP WE ONLY HAVE FOOD 
FOR THIS MORNING SAYS THE MOTHER 
FROM TONIGHT WE HAVE NOTHING SOME 
SUPPLIERS ARE NOW GETTING THROUGH 
FOREIGN AID ARRIVING AT RANGOON 
AIRPORT AIRPORT TODAY BUT IT IS 
NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH ON STATE 
TELEVISION BURMA'S AUTHORITARIAN 
RULERS ARE TRYING TO PROVE THEY 
HAVE THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL 
BUT THE GENERALS ARE FAILING 
LISTEN TO THIS ASSESSMENT FROM MY 
COLLEAGUE IN RANGOON A B. B. C. 
JOURNALIST WHOSE IDENTITY MUST BE 
KEPT SECRET FOR HIS OWN SAFETY 
THOUSANDS OF TREES NOW LIVE ON WHAT 
WERE ONCE LEAFY AVENUES MASSIVE 
TREE TRUNKS RIPPED UP ACROSS THE 
WHOLE CITY THERE IS BARELY A 
SINGLE BUILDING LEFT UNTOUCHED BY 
THE FORCE OF THE WIND FUEL IS IN 
SHORT SUPPLY AND CARS ARE QUEUEING 
OVERNIGHT FOR JUST A FEW LITRES OF 
PETROL AND THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY 
FOR THOSE WITHOUT GENERATORS THERE 
IS SOME 
FOOD AVAILABLE BUT ONLY FOR 
THOSE WHO CAN PAY AND PRICES ARE 
GOING UP BY TWO HUNDRED PER CENT AND THERE 
CLIMBING EVERY DAY 
OUTSIDE BURMA 
MOUNTAINS OF AID ARE PILING UP BUT 
WHY ISN'T MORE GETTING THROUGH FOR 
NOW THE GENERALS ARE STILL 
DRAGGING THEIR FEET FROM THAILAND 
TODAY THESE AMERICAN MILITARY 
CARGO PLANES WERE POISED TO FLY IN 
BUT THEY ARE STILL BEING BLOCKED BY 
A BURMA'S ISOLATED GOVERNMENT AND A 
WALL OF RED TAPE RIGHT NOW THE 
BURMESE AUTHORITIES ARE BLOCKING 
THE VISAS OF SOME FORTY KEY 
INTERNATIONAL AID WORKERS A 
RECLUSIVE REGIME PLAYING POLITICS 
WHILE ITS PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING 
THEY WANTED TO SHOW THE ARMY IS THE 
ONLY INSTITUTION WHO IS TAKING CARE 
OF ITS OWN PEOPLE IN BURMA SO THEY 
DON'T WANT TO SHARE CREDIT TO ANY 
OTHER ORGANISATIONS 
TODAY A FEW 
MORE FAMILIES WERE PLUCKED FROM THE 
FLOOD ZONE BUT THIS DISASTER 
REQUIRES AN ARMADA OF BOATS AND AN 
ARMY OF MEDICAL TEAMS MANY WOUNDED 
STILL WAITING FOR TREATMENT IT IS 
FIVE DAYS AFTER THE CYCLONE STRUCK 
THE DIFFICULTIES FACED BY 
INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES TO GET THEIR 
SUPPLIES AND EXPERTS INTO A BURMA 
MEANS THE CYCLONE DISASTER IS 
PROVING TO BE BOTH A HUMANITARIAN 
AND DIPLOMATIC CHALLENGE SPEAKING 
JUST BEFORE WE WENT ON AIR THE 
UNITED NATIONS EMERGENCY RELIEF CO 
ORDINATOR SIR JOHN HOLMES 
EXPRESSED HIS OWN FRUSTRATION AT 
BURMA'S MILITARY LEADERSHIP 
WE ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO HELP THE 
GOVERNMENT OF MYANMAR TO CARRY OUT 
THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO AID THESE 
PEOPLE IN DESPERATE NEED AND 
INCREASINGLY DESPERATE NEED AS WE 
CAN ALL SEE FROM THE REPORTS WE ARE 
SEEING WE ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO 
HELP PEOPLE THERE ARE NO OTHER 
POLITICAL MOTIVES I. N. D. IN THIS AND 
THEREFORE WE REALLY DO I APPEAL 
VERY STRONGLY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF 
MYANMAR BOTH TO STEP UP THEIR OWN 
EFFORTS TO HELP PEOPLE ON THE 
GROUND AND TO CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE 
COMPLETELY TO THE EFFORTS THAT WE 
ARE MAKING 
JOINING US HERE IS 
DAVID HANNAY BRITAIN'S FORMER 
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS 
WHAT DO YOU DO IN SUCH A SITUATION 
WHEN YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY SO 
SUSPICIOUS ABOUT OUTSIDE 
INTERVENTION TRY TO ASSURE THEM 
THIS IS ALL HUMANITARIAN OR WHAT I I THINK YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE WHOLE 
DISCUSSION ON A HUMANITARIAN LEVEL 
I THINK THE MINUTE YOU START 
TALKING ABOUT 
IT 
IN POLITICAL 
TERMS 
IT JUST GETS WORSE BUT THAT 
DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY YOU CANNOT 
BRING PRESSURE 
TO BEAR 
FROM A WHOLE 
NUMBER OF COUNTRIES FRIENDS OF 
BURMA LIKE CHINA AND INDIA AND AT 
THE UNITED NATIONS AND ELSEWHERE 
IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT TO GET IT 
ACROSS TO THE MILITARY RULERS OF 
THIS COUNTRY THAT NO ONE IS TRYING 
TO PLAY POLITICS HERE WHAT THE F. A. 
IS IS TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES AND 
THEY NEED HELP THEY HAVE 
RECOGNISED THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE 
APPEALED FOR HELP IT IS FRANKLY 
SHAMEFUL THAT HAVING APPEALED FOR 
HELP THEY ARE NOT GIVING THESE IS 
NOT ALLOWING PLANES IN AS 
FREQUENTLY AS THEY SHOULD DO NOT 
ALLOWING TEAMS TO MOVE IN THERE AND 
SAVE THE LIVES OF THESE PEOPLE SO 
DO YOU 
THINK THEN 
THAT WHAT 
IS 
GOING ON NOW IS THAT INTERMEDIARIES 
INDONESIA FOR INSTANCE QUITE 
FRIENDLY WITH BURMA THAT THEY WILL 
BE ASKED ONE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT VISAS ARE 
BEING GIVEN TO ALLOW THOSE MUCH 
NEEDED RELIEF WORKERS IN 
I THINK 
THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS GOING ON WITH 
MANY GOVERNMENTS ANYONE WHO HAS 
ANY INFLUENCE WITH THE RULERS IN 
MYANMAR IS BEING ASKED TO USE THAT 
INFLUENCE TO GET THEM TO OPEN THE 
DOORS TO THIS HUMANITARIAN EFFORT 
I THINK THAT HAS TO BE STEPPED UP 
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT I DON'T 
MYSELF THINK 
IT IS SENSIBLE TO 
START CANVASSING IDEAS 
ABOUT THE 
USE OF FORCE 
I THINK 
THAT 
JUST SEIZE UP A WHOLE THING THESE 
GENERALS BELIEVE THE WHOLE WORLD IS 
OUT TO DO THEM HARM 
WHAT ABOUT 
AIRDROPS OF RELIEF 
AIRDROPS ARE A 
THING THAT THE MEDIA ALWAYS TURN TO 
IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS 
I'M SO SORRY 
FOR BEING SO AN ORIGINAL THE THE MILITARY WILL TELLY IT IS NOT 
USUALLY A TERRIBLY GOOD WAY OF 
GETTING STUFF TO PEOPLE 
PARTICULARLY WHEN THE LAND IS 
FLOODING BUT FLOODED WHEN THE 
ASSAULT WATER EVERYWHERE AND SO ON 
WHAT YOU NEED IS 
HELICOPTERS THAT 
IS 
WHAT WE 
SAW AT THE TIME OF THE 
TSUNAMI THE HELICOPTERS MANY OF 
WHICH WERE PROVIDED BY THE U. S. NAVY 
AND THEY MADE NO POLITICAL 
INTERFERENCE IN THE UNEASY AT ALL 
WERE CRUCIAL IN SAVING LIVES BUT BUT WHEN WE SAW THE FRENCH INITIATIVE 
BY THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAYING 
LOOK WE HAVE THIS PRINCIPLE AT THE 
UN RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT IS 
THERE SOME KIND OF NICK NURSE 
MECHANISM THAT THE UN COULD USE TO 
KIND OF BYPASS AND JUST FORCED THE 
GENERALS INTO ACCEPTING HELP I I THINK IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE ARE 
LOOKING HERE 
OF A 
HUGE 
DISASTER THE ANSWER IS THAT IT 
WILL NOT MAKE THINGS BETTER IF YOU 
START TALKING ABOUT FORCE THE 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT IS A VERY 
REAL INTERNATIONAL RULE IT WAS 
ADOPTED THREE YEARS AGO IT IS 
QUITE DIFFICULT TO APPLY IN 
PRACTICE IT IS CRUCIAL HOWEVER 
THAT WE DO GET HELP TO THESE PEOPLE 
THE REAL TOUCHSTONE IS HOW IS THE 
BEST WAY TO GET HELP TO THEM IS IT 
BEST TO START TALKING ABOUT 
BYPASSING 
THE GOVERNMENT 
OR 
IS IT 
BEST TO START TALKING ABOUT 
PERSUADING THE GOVERNMENT TO ADMIT 
WORKERS I THINK IT IS THE SECOND 
YOU SAID THE RESPONSIBILITY TO 
PROTECT SO MUCH FUSS ABOUT IT 
BASICALLY NOT WORTH THE PAPER IT IS 
WRITTEN ON 
I THINK THAT IS A 
SIMPLISTIC VIEW IN DARFUR BELIEVE 
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT HIS 
VERY REAL AND THE UN IS GRADUALLY 
BEGINNING TO DEPLOY PEACEKEEPERS TO 
PROTECT THE POPULATION AND SO ON 
WE ARE NOT TALKING HERE ABOUT 
PROTECTING THE POPULATION WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT HELPING THEM 
BRINGING AID TO THEM THINGS THAT 
CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT THE CO 
OPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
COUNTRY NOBODY IS GOING TO GO IN 
AND TAKE OVER THEIR COUNTRY AND RUN 
IT FOR THEM 
MAYBE PERHAPS MORE 
FORCE AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL BUT 
DO YOU THINK THE POSITIONS OF CHINA 
AND RUSSIA WOULD MAKE THAT TOO 
DIFFICULT 
I THINK IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT USEFUL IF SOMEWHERE AT THE UN IT 
WAS STATED CATEGORICALLY THAT 
EVERYBODY SAYS THERE IS A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE 
LUCKLESS VICTIMS OF THIS DISASTER 
THAT RESPONSIBILITY RESTS ON THE 
GOVERNMENT THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT 
BUT THEY CANNOT FULFIL IT ENTIRELY 
SO THEY MUST LOOK TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HELP 
THEM SO THE WAY YOU FULFIL THEIR 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT IN THESE 
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN MY 
VIEW IS A JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND THE 
GOVERNMENT OF MYANMAR THE SOONER 
THEY REALISE THEY KNOW THEY NEED 
HELP AND NEEDING HELP MEANS OPENING 
THEIR DOORS AND GETTING PEOPLE HILL 
GETTING PEOPLE IN I HOPE I 
TOMORROW THEY WILL REALLY UNDERSTOOD IT 
AND THE 
PENNY WILL 
HAVE 
DROPPED AND 
THEY WILL 
BE 
GETTING 
HELP THEY 
NEED LORD HANNAY 
LORD HANNAY THANK YOU 
THERE ARE FEARS TONIGHT FOR THE 
STABILITY OF LEBANON THE 
OPPOSITION HEZBOLLAH WITH CLOSE 
TIES TO SYRIA AND IRAN HAS LEFT A 
BIT ONGOING PROTESTS AGAINST THE 
PRO WESTERN GOVERNMENT AND IS 
REPORTED CLASHES AND GUM PIPES 
HASSAN NASRALLAH HAS WARNED ALL OUT 
WAR IF GOVERNMENT FORCES MOVE 
AGAINST HIS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK 
LEBANON'S FIFTEEN YEAR CIVIL WAR HAS 
LEFT A LEGACY OF FRAGILE UNITY THE 
ARMY HAS WARNED ITS UNITY MIGHT 
BREAK DOWN ALONG SECTARIAN LINES 
LET'S GO LIVE TO BE A ROOT AND OUR 
CORRESPONDENT JIM MUIR WHAT HAS 
BROUGHT MATTERS TO A HEAD THIS 
TIME 
I THINK THERE ARE TWO TIME IMMEDIATE TRIGGERS FOR THE CURRENT 
CRISIS BUT OF COURSE IT HAS BEEN 
BUILDING FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR 
MORE WHAT 
HAS BOUGHT 
IT 
TO A 
HEAD 
THIS WEEK 
ARE TWO 
THINGS FIRST 
OF 
ALL 
ON MONDAY 
NIGHT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAD A MARATHON SESSION 
AFTER WHICH IT ANNOUNCED SOME 
MEASURES CLEARLY AIMED AGAINST 
HEZBOLLAH REMOVING THE HEAD OF 
SECURITY WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE A 
BIT SUPPORTED BY HEZBOLLAH ON 
THE GROUNDS HE HAD NOT TAKEN ACTION 
AGAINST ALLEGED PLACEMENT BY ASIF 
OF SURVEILLANCE OVERLOOKING THE 
RUNWAY AND ALSO BASICALLY SAYING 
THAT HEZBOLLAH'S COMMUNICATIONS 
NETWORK IT HAS ITS OWN PRIVATE 
PHONE NETWORK SHOULD BE 
DISMANTLED WITH PROSECUTION OF 
THOSE INVOLVED AS OBST SAW THIS AS 
CONFRONTATIONAL WHEN THE SECOND 
EVENT HAPPENED WORKERS' STRIKE 
YESTERDAY WEDNESDAY IT RAPIDLY 
BECAME OVERTAKEN BY THE OPPOSITION 
USING IT AS A VEHICLE AGAINST THE 
GOVERNMENT SO INSTEAD OF JUST A 
QUITE WORKERS' STRIKE IT BECAME A 
VERY NOISY AFFAIR WITH ROADS BEING 
BLOCKED BY BURNING TYRES SET BY 
HEZBOLLAH AND ITS SUPPORTERS AND 
OF COURSE LATER IN THE DAY THERE 
WERE GUN BATTLES IN VERY SENSITIVE 
AREAS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTH BEIRUT 
WHERE THE SUNNI AND SHI'ITE AREAS 
OVERLAP IT TURNED FROM A SINGLE 
EVENT ONE DAY WORKERS' STRIKE 
INTO SOMETHING MUCH MORE SERIOUS A 
MUCH MORE SERIOUS STATE OF 
CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE 
OPPOSITION AND THE GOVERNMENT A A FEW HOURS THERE WE HAD A VERY 
STRONG SPEECH BY THE PIERCE LEADER 
SHEIKH HASSAN NASRALLAH HOW FAR IS 
HE UPPING THE ANTE 
IT DEPENDS HOW 
YOU READ IT YOU COULD SEE IT AS 
SIMPLY A STATEMENT OF HIS POSITION 
AND INTENDING IF YOU READ IT 
POSITIVELY BETWEEN THE LINES TO 
KEEP THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE NOT 
RATCHETING UP THE PRESSURE ON THE 
GOVERNMENT BUT NOT NECESSARILY 
THREATENING ESCALATION HE BLAMED 
THE GOVERNMENT VERY CLEARLY FOR 
WHAT IT HAPPENED BLAMING IT 
BECAUSE OF THOSE DECISIONS TAKEN ON 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT HERE IS WHAT HE 
HAD TO SAY ON THAT THIS DECISION IS FIRST OF ALL A 
DECLARATION OF WAR AND A LAUNCHING 
OF WAR BY THE GOVERNMENT OF WALID 
JUMBLATT AGAINST THE RESISTANCE 
FOR THE BENEFIT OF AMERICA AND 
ISRAEL AND ON THEIR BEHALF WE ARE 
NOT DISTORTING THIS IT IS AS CLEAR 
AS THE SUN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY 
JIM ANOTHER WORRYING DEVELOPMENT 
IS THIS COMMENT BY THE ARMY THAT 
ITS OWN UNITY MAY BREAK DOWN IT 
HAD BEEN SEEN VERY MUCH AS A BEACON 
OF STABILITY AMONGST ALL THESE 
TROUBLES 
THAT'S RIGHT IF THE ARMY TROUBLES WERE TO GO TO PIECES I THINK MANY 
LEBANESE WOULD LOSE HOPE BECAUSE IT 
IS THE LAST REMAINING BACKBONE OF 
THE COUNTRY DURING THE EARLIER 
CIVIL WARS FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE ARMY DID 
GO TO PIECES ALONG SECTARIAN LINES 
THE CURRENT SITUATION TODAY IS 
THREATENING TO DO THE SAME THING 
BECAUSE IT IS PUTTING THE ARMY IN A 
VERY STRESSFUL POSITION WHERE IT 
IS BEING ASKED BY THE GOVERNMENT 
INTERVENED AGAINST 
HEZBOLLAH TO 
CLEAR 
THE ROADS 
AND SO 
ON WHICH 
WOULD BE SEEN AS TAKING SIDES SO 
IT 
VERY HARD TO 
NEUTRAL TO 
INTERVENE TO 
STOP 
FIGHTING ON THE 
GROUND BUT 
NOT TO 
BE SEEN 
TO BE 
TAKING SIDES WITH A 
GOVERNMENT 
WHICH HAS 
NO SHI'ITE 
COMPONENT IN IT ANY MORE THEREFORE 
IS REGARDED MORE AS A PARTY THAN AS 
A NEUTRAL STATE THAT IS WHY IT HAS 
PUT OUT THE STATEMENT SAYING IF 
ALL SIDES DON'T BACK DOWN IN THE 
NATIONAL INTEREST 
ITS OWN 
UNITY 
COULD WELL BE THREATENED 
JIM MUIR 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
IN ISRAEL CELEBRATIONS ARE TAKING 
PLACE TO MARK THE FOUNDING OF THE 
STATE IT WAS THREE YEARS AFTER THE 
END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND THE 
DEATH OF SIX MILLION JEWS IN THE 
HOLOCAUST HOLOCAUST OUR MIDDLE EAST EDITOR HAS THIS 
SPECIAL REPORT FROM JERUSALEM 
ISRAEL HAS A LOT TO CELEBRATE 
THE AIR SHOW OVER TEL AVIV WAS FOR 
A STATE THAT HAS ABSORBED MILLIONS 
OF JEWISH REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS 
CREATED A HI TECH ECONOMY AND THE 
MIDDLE EAST'S STRONGEST ARMED 
FORCES FORCES WHAT IT HAS NEVER HAD IS PEACE 
THIS IS A FARMING SETTLEMENT 
FOUNDED BY POLISH JEWS WHO ESCAPED 
THE NAZI HOLOCAUST THE SIX MILLION 
DEAD ARE COMET RATED IN THE MUSEUM 
THEY RESERVE PRESERVED THE 
BATTLEFIELD WHERE THEY FOUGHT 
SOLDIERS FROM EGYPT 
ONE OF THE FIVE ARAB STATES AFTER 
THE NATION'S STATEMENT OF 
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE 
I HAVE NO WAY TO REACH THEM I WAS 
VERY VERY ANGRY 
MORE RECENTLY 
PALESTINIAN ROCKETS HAVE HIT THE 
KIBBUTZ ISRAELIS CAN FEEL STRONG 
AND INSTUER AT THE SAME TIME 
BECAUSE OF PLACES LIKE YAB MORDECAI 
A FEW MILES AWAY BEYOND ISRAEL'S 
BORED DER FENCES IS GAZA 
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS CAN HAVE 
LONG ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE CAUSES OF 
TODAY'S VIOLENCE AND THE VIOLENCE 
OF SIXTY YEARS' BUT IF THEY WANT TO 
HAVE PEACE THEY NEED TO MAKE A DEAL 
ABOUT SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF 
NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT NOW THAT MEANS CREATING A 
PALESTINIAN STATE ALONGSIDE ISRAEL 
AND DECIDING WHAT TO DO ABOUT 
JERUSALEM AND WHAT TO DO WITH 
PALESTINIAN REFUGEES THE KIND OF 
PEOPLE WHOSE FAMILIES USED TO LIVE 
NEAR YAD MORDECAI AND WHO NOW LIVE 
IN GAZA 
ONE OF MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND 
PALESTINIANS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES 
IN WHAT BECAME ISRAEL IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT IS 
AHMAD ABDALLAH A RETIRED 
HEADMASTER HE CARRYIS SCARS FROM 
AN ISRAELI ATTACK THAT KILLED HIS 
FIVE SISTERS AND TWO BROTHERS WHAT 
TIME THEY WERE FLEEING THEIR 
VILLAGE HE HAS THE TITLE DEEDS TO 
HIS FAMILY'S CONFISCATED PROPERTY 
HE WILL NEVER ACCEPT IT IS ISRAEL'S 
IF THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS O. K. 
THAT I COULD TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE 
INSTEAD OF THIS I WOULD REJECT THE 
OFFER OFFER YOU WOULD NOT TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE 
NO MY ROOTS ARE THERE MY FATHER 
IS BURIED THERE MY FAMILY IS THERE 
MY GRANDFATHER IS THERE 
ONLY A FEW BITS OF RUBBLE REMAIN AT 
THE SIGHT OF HIS VILLAGE THE 
ISRAELI MEMORIAL LIKE ALL ISRAELI 
TERRITORY BEFORE NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT CAPTURED IS 
NOT UP FOR NEGOTIATION 
FOR ALL THAT HAS CHANGED IN SIXTY 
YEARS THE CHOICE IS THE SAME 
FINDING A WAY TO SATISFY THE TWO 
PEOPLES WHO BELIEVE THIS SHAND 
THEIRS OR FIGHTING FOR IT 
NOW THE DAY'S OTHER NEWS AS MANY 
AS FORTY THOUSAND WORKERS AND FAMILIES HAVE 
BEEN FORCED OFF FARMS IN POST 
ELECTION VIOLENCE IN ZIMBABWE 
ACCORDING TO A FARM WORKER'S UNION 
IT SAYS THAT THE AGRICULTURE WORK 
PRESSURES TARGETED AS THE 
GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THEY VOTED FOR 
THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE 
THE RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT HAS 
APPOINTED THE RUSSIAN PRIME 
MINISTER OF VLADIMIR PUTIN THE 
VOTE FOLLOWS MONTHS OF POLITICAL 
MANOEUVRING TO ENSURE THAT VLADIMIR 
PUTIN REMAINS AT THE HEART OF POWER 
AT THE END OF HIS PRESIDENTIAL TERM 
SILVIO BERLUSCONI HAS BEEN SWORN IN 
FOR A THIRD TERM AS ITALY'S PRIME 
MINISTER MINISTER HE HAS PROMISED TO FIGHT CRIME 
CLAMP DOWN ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
AND CLEAR THE MOUNDS OF RUBBISH IN 
NAPLES NAPLES IT'S THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF 
DEVOLUTION IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
GORDON BROWN AND BRIAN COWAN ARE 
ATTENDING A THREE DAY INVESTMENT 
CONFERENCE IN BELFAST AIMED AT 
CAPITALISING ON THE PROVINCE'S 
RECENT POLITICAL PROGRESS CHINESE 
MOUNTAINEERS HAVE TAKEN THE OLYMPIC 
FLAME TO THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT 
EVEREST THE TEAM CARRIES SPECIAL 
HIGH ALT TUED TORCHES 
AND CHINA'S PRESIDENT HU JINTAO 
HAS BEEN SHOWING OFF HIS PING PONG 
SKILLS ON DAY THREE OF HIS STATE 
VISIT TO JAPAN HE TOOK ON ONE OF 
THE TOP PLAYERS AND PRO TIBET AND 
PRO CHINA PROTESTORS WERE INJOFLED 
IN LIGHT SCUFFLES OUTSIDE 
INVOLVED 
NOW HALF A MILLION READY MEALS AND 
MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND WHOLE CHICKENS 
JUST SOME OF THE PERFECTLY GOOD 
FOOD THROWN IN THE BIN BY BRITISH 
FAMILIES EVERY DAY ACCORDING TO 
RESEARCH BRITISH PEOPLE ARE 
DISPOSING OF TEN BILLION WORTH OF 
FOOD EACH YEAR MUCH OF IT IS 
UNTOUCHED AND STIM WITHIN ITS SELL 
BY DATE THE REPORT COMES A 
AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE 
INCREASES OF BASIC FOODS STUCHS 
INCREASES HAVE HAVE CAUSED RIOTING 
IN SOME THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES 
IT IS NOT JUST THE COST OF FOOD 
GOING UP SO IT SEEMS IS THE 
AMOUNT WE THROW AWAY SO BILLION 
EACH YEAR CORDING TO WRAP THE 
GOVERNMENT'S WASTE AND AMP RESOURCES 
ACTION PROGRAMME THE RESEARCHERS 
WENT THROUGH BINS TO DISCOVER NOT 
JUST THE VOLUMES OF FOOD THROWN 
AWAY BUT THE DIFFERENT TYPES SO 
YOGHURT PORTS AROUND ONE P. THREE MILLION 
ARE THROWN INTO THE BINS EVERY DAY 
FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WHOLE CHICKENS NEVER MAKE IT 
OUT OF THEIR PACKAGING AND NEVER 
EVEN MAKE IT INTO THE OVEN THEY 
MAY BE CONVENIENT BUT IT IS 
THOUGHT THAT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND READY MALES 
EACH DAY END UP UNUSE UNUSED 
UNEATEN AND IN THE BIN 
I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL BE VERY 
SHOCKED THE FIGURES ARE 
ASTONISHING I THINK THAT PEOPLE 
WILL WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
THAT MEANS PLANNING MORE CAREFULLY 
LOOKING AT THE STORAGE INFORMATION 
TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THEY STORE 
THE FOOD CORRECTLY AND TRYING TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THEY USE IT BEFORE 
IT GOES OUT OF DIED 
BUT AS EMITY 
KNOWS THAT IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE 
A BUSY MUM SHE FINDS HERSELF 
THROWING AWAY FOOD EVERY WEEK 
WHEN YOU GO TO A SUPERMARKET YOU 
GO IN FOR PICK AND MILK AND BREAD 
THEN YOU SEE THE APPLES THEN YOU 
BUY THE CAKE IT IS SE WELL 
PRESENTED ON THE SHELF THAT THAT RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT IN BRITAIN 
BUT IT COULD VERY WELL REFLECT THE 
SITUATION IN MANY WESTERN NATIONS 
WE ARE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY THE 
FOOD HISTORIAN AND AUTHOR OF A 
HISTORY OF BRITAIN THROUGH COOKING 
KATE COLQUHOUN IS THIS ANOTHER 
EXAMPLE OF OUR THROW AWAY CONSUMER 
SOCIETY 
I THIS IT IS WE HAVE BEEN SOCIETY THROUGH FRUGALITY COME THROUGH 
GREED AND ARE HAVING TO RETURN TO 
THRIFT WESTERN GOVERNMENTS HAVE 
PURSUED ESPECIALLYALLY URBANISED 
COUNTRIES HAVE PURSUED THIS AT ANY 
COST FOR US WE ARE SPENDING A 
LOWER PROPORTION OF INCOME THAN WE 
HAVE DONE ON FOOD CLEARLY WE VALUE 
IT LOWLY 
SO I THINK WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN 
JUST A GENERATION IS WE HAVE LOST 
THE KNACK AND THE PLEASURE AND THE 
PRIDE THAT HAS BEEN KEPT IN MOST 
CONTINENTAL EUROPE MOST OF THE 
MIDDLE EAST IN MOST OF ASIA IN 
MAKING FOOD LAST UNTIL IT HAS 
FINISHED FINISHED YOU CAN'T DO IT YOU USE IT YOU 
CAN'T USE IT BY THE SELL BY DATE 
YOU THROW IT AWAY YOU THINK YOU 
MAY GET POISONED 
WELL WHETHER THE 
FOOD SMELLS OR LOOKS GOOD YOU USE 
YOUR OWN JUDGMENT 
YOU ARE NOT SUGGESTS TO SAVE IT 
AFRB THE SELL BY DATE 
I CAN'T BUT 
COMMON SENSE THROWING A COMPLETE 
CHICK NO ONE THE BIN IS BONKERS IF 
IT HAS SLIPPED OVER ITS SELL BY 
DATE BY A DAY IT COULD BE OPENED 
SMELLED TOUCHED WE ARE SO URBAN 
SO DIVORCED FROM THE SOURCES OF OUR 
FOOD WE DON'T KNOW WHAT FRESH FOOD 
COULD LOOK LIKE 
BUT YOU ARE ONLY TALKING SURELY 
ABOUT THE BETTER OFF GROUPS OF 
SOCIETY THAT PEOPLE LOWER DOWN THE 
INCOME SCALE ARE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT 
WHAT 
THEY THROW AWAY PRESUMABLY PRESUMABLY THEY ARE THEY ARE SPENDING A 
LARGER PROPORTION OF THEIR INCOMES 
ON FOOD THEY ARE STRUGGLE 
STRUGGLING WHAT WE HAVE SEEN 
PROBABLY ALSO IN A LOT OF OTHER 
COUNTRIES LIKE AMERICA AND 
AUSTRALIA TOO WE ARE NOT TEACHING 
CHILDREN HOW TO COOK ANY MORE WE 
ARE GIVING THEM LOW VALUE FOODS TO 
EAT AND LOSING THE BASIC SKILLS 
THAT OUR MOTHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS 
HAD OF WHAT TO DO WITH IT 
DO YOU 
THINK THAT THE GREEN MOVEMENT NOW 
THE DECISION TO GO ORGANIC IS 
MAKING THEM MORE IN TOUCH WITH THE 
FOOD CHAIN HOW IT IS PRODUCED IT 
IS NOT JUST A CHIENY PACKAGE YOU 
BUY IN A SUPERMARKET IS THAT NOT 
CHANGING 
I THINK THEY ARE THE CHANGING CONTEXT OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND 
ANXIETIES IT IS CLEARLY A MORAL 
ISSUE IF HALF OF THE WORLD IS 
STARVING HOW DARE WE THROW AWAY SO 
MUCH FOOD IN ENGLAND TEN BILLION 
WORTH OF FOOD EVERY YEAR WHAT I 
THINK WILL CHANGE PEOPLE'S HABITS 
IS WHEN IT HITS THEM IN THEIR 
POCKETS THE ERA OF CHEAP FOOD FOR 
US IS OVER WE CAN SEE THAT IN THE 
PRICE RISES SO HABITS WILL HAVE TO 
CHANGE IT WILL NOT BE A MID 
MIDDLE CLASS ASPIRATIONAL ORGANIC 
MOVEMENT IT WILL BE ABOUT KEEPING 
THE LIDS ON OUR BELTS 
AND DO YOU THINK WE WILL START 
TURNING MORE TO QUALITY FOOD AS 
PART AND PARCEL OF ALL OF THIS I I HOPE SO BRITAIN EATS MORE READY 
MEALS THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE 
WORLD WORLD I DON'T 
BUT WE HAVE A T. V. CHEF 
CULTURE THAT HAS MISSED THE TRICK 
IT STRESSES HOW TO COOK FAST OVER 
HOW TO COOK WITH GOOD QUALITY BUT 
LOW COST INGREDIENTS AND HOW TO USE 
THEM UP THESE ARE ANCIENT THINGS 
YOU SOUND LIKE A ONE WOMAN FOOD 
REVOLUTION THE TOP STORY THE 
FIRST UN FLIGHT HAS REACHED RANGOON 
CARRYING AID SUPPLIES FOR THE 
VICTIMS OF BURMA'S CYCLONE A UN 
OFFICIAL WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT 
BURMA HAD MOVE SOD SLOWLY ON 
LIFTING RESTRICTIONS FOR THE AID TO 
GET INTO THE COUNTRY 
THIS IS WORLD NEWS TODAY 
THAT IS ALL FROM THE PROGRAMME 
NEXT ON B. B. C. FOUR IT IS THE WEATHER 
WITH ALEXANDER DEAKIN BUT FOR NOW 
FROM ME ZEINAB BADAWI AND THE REST 
OF THE TEAM GOODBYE
