OOH OOH 
AND MY GARDEN ROBINS ARE GETTING INTO A RIGHT OLD FLAP 
PLUS OUR VERSION OF MOST HAUNTED ONLY WITH BETTER ACTING 
OH WHAT WAS THAT 
FIRST THOUGH A QUESTION 
WHICH OF BRITAIN'S BIRDS DO YOU RECKON IS THE HARDEST TO SEE 
M. M. M. 
A VERY SMALL ONE 
THE EAGLE RED KITE 
THE BITTERN RARE FALCON 
AN OWL OR SOMETHING NIGHTJARS 
MOORHENS THEY'RE INCREDIBLY SHY 
A PEREGRINE FALCON 
SOMETHING LIKE A KINGFISHER 
DODO YOU CAN'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE 
PROBABLY A CORNCRAKE 
YOU HEAR THEM BUT YOU DON'T SEE THEM 
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT 
YOU DO INDEED HEAR THEM BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
SUCH AS THE HEBRIDES OR PARTS OF SCOTLAND AND IRELAND 
BUT EVEN THERE YOU DON'T SEE MUCH OF THEM BECAUSE NOT ONLY 
ARE THEY VERY SKULKY THEY'RE PRETTY RARE 
CORNCRAKES HAVE DEFINITELY SUFFERED BECAUSE OF MODERN FARMING PRACTICES 
GRASSLAND TOO SHORT FOR NESTS AND CHICKS MANGLED AT HARVEST TIME 
I MEAN NO WONDER THEY KEEP A LOW PROFILE 
I TELL YOU THEY'VE GIVEN ME A RUN AROUND A FEW TIMES OH YES 
BUT THIS TIME I'VE BEEN REALLY REALLY LUCKY 
AND I'VE MANAGED TO GET JUST A LITTLE BIT CLOSER 
THERE HE IS 
LOOK AT THIS PLACE EH 
OH BABE MAGNET FLAT IF EVER THERE WAS ONE DON'T YOU THINK 
YEAH NOW THIS IS A MALE AND IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME 
IT'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW THE BREEDING SEASON 
SO HE'S GONNA START CALLING HE'LL BE GOING DO YOU MIND 
HE'S NOT IMPRESSED BUT HOPEFULLY A FEMALE WILL BE 
AND THAT IS WHEN HE'LL BE PUT TOGETHER WITH A FEMALE 
WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT 
WELL HE'S PART OF A BREEDING PROGRAMME AND ALL THE MALES HAVE GOT A SORT OF VIRILITY RATING 
THAT'S YOU DOWN THERE THERE YOU GO 
HE WOULDN'T TELL YOU HIMSELF BUT THE FACT IS HE'S A BIT OF A STUD 
SO IT'S GONNA BE A LUCKY LADY 
THIS CASANOVA CORNCRAKE IS PART OF AN ATTEMPT TO RETURN 
THAT STRANGE RASPING CALL TO PARTS OF BRITAIN 
WHERE IT HASN'T BEEN HEARD FOR CENTURIES 
AND WE'LL BE BACK IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME TO SEE HOW HE'S GOT ON 
H. M. M. CAN'T SAY IT SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE A ROMANTIC MELODY TO ME 
BUT TO A CORNCRAKE IT'S A SERENADE OF LOVE 
AND AFTER A FEW WEEKS OF SCHMOOZING AND ALL THAT MALARKEY 
THERE'S MORE THAN JUST CORNCRAKES IN THE PENS 
CORNCRAKE EGGS 
DELICATE AND PRECIOUS 
IN FACT SO PRECIOUS THAT THEY DON'T LET MUM AND DAD RAISE THEM 
NO NO NO IT'S OFF TO THE LABS FOR A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC T. L. C. 
STAGE ONE PLACE IN INCUBATOR AND GENTLY COOK AT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR DEGREES FOR FOURTEEN DAYS 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT STAGE TWO IS 
OH YES LITTLE FLUFFY LUMPS 
AND STAGE THREE WELL THIS IS WHAT WE CALL IN T. V. A TEASE 
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE PROGRAMME TO FIND OUT 
IRRITATING YES BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT ANYWAY AND I PROMISE IT'S WORTH WAITING FOR 
MEANWHILE I COMMEND YOU TO THE AGREEABLE COMPANY OF WILDLIFE CAMERAMAN JOHN AITCHISON 
THAT'S TYPICAL OF THIS PLACE THIS IS A WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT A DAPPLED BACKWATER IN DORSET 
IT'S NOT YOUR NORMAL TERRITORY IS IT 
NO NO HE'S A STRANGER ROUND THESE PARTS I CAN TELL YOU 
BUT I'D CALL THIS OTTER COUNTRY YOU SEE BUT I HAPPEN TO KNOW YOU'VE 
FILMED OTTERS MANY MANY TIMES BUT NOT ANYWHERE LIKE THIS RIGHT 
NO NOT ON RIVERS I'VE NEVER FILMED THEM ON RIVERS 
I FILM THEM BY THE SEA COS I LIVE BY THE COAST 
AH YES EXQUISITE CLOSE UPS OF OTTERS FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR OWN BACK YARD 
BUT WHAT ABOUT DOWN ERE IN DORSET M. M. 
YOUR CHALLENGE TODAY IS TO FILM OTTERS YES 
BUT THERE IS ONE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU FILMING OTTERS IN SCOTLAND AND FILMING THEM DOWN HERE 
THEY ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY NOCTURNAL IN DORSET SO IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY DARK 
RIGHT I'M GONNA NEED SOME EXTRA KIT I THINK 
OH YES 
H. M. M. 
H. M. M. INDEED JOHN 
SO HAVE YOU GOT A CUNNING PLAN 
LIKE HIDING BEHIND A SMALL TREE 
ANY OTHER THOUGHTS HOW CAN YOU FILM AN OTTER IN PITCH DARKNESS 
IT HAS TO BE INFRARED LIGHT WHICH IS USEFUL BECAUSE THE OTTERS CAN'T SEE IT AND I CAN'T SEE IT EITHER 
WHICH MEANS A SPECIAL CAMERA WHICH FORTUNATELY I'VE GOT SO THERE'S QUITE A LOT TO DO ACTUALLY 
I'VE GOT TO RIG UP LIGHTS HERE IN THE TREES AND PUT UP A HIDE 
AND PUT THE INFRARED CAMERA INTO IT BETTER GET STARTED I THINK 
I'VE JUST GOT ONE LITTLE WORRY 
I HOPE ALL THESE WEIRD CHALLENGES I'M SETTING AREN'T BEGINNING TO MESS WITH HIS MIND A BIT 
JUST HAD A SUDDEN VISION OF AN OTTER DISCOVERING ALL THIS CABLE 
AND PLAYING SOME MAD GAME AND LEAVING IT ALL WRAPPED ROUND THE TREES AND UP EVERYWHERE 
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
I BET YOU HAD NO IDEA IT WAS GONNA INVOLVE SO MUCH AGONY ON MY PART BILL 
OH I DID YES 
WELL EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE WORKING JUST NOW 
IT'S JUST THE MAIN INFRARED CAMERA WITH A BIG LENS ON AND A SCREEN HERE WHICH IS 
SHOWING ME AT THE MOMENT THE RIVER AND THE LOGS WHERE BILL AND I SAT 
STILL NOTHING GOING ON 
IT'S VERY QUIET IN FACT THERE'S NOTHING MOVING AT ALL 
ON ANY OF THE CAMERAS 
BIT LIKE SPRINGWATCH 
ERM JOHN SOMETHING IS HAPPENING ACTUALLY 
ALL THOSE LIGHTS ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO FLASH ON AND OFF LIKE THAT 
OH DEAR 
ALL THE LIGHTS HAVE GONE COMPLETELY BERSERK TOTAL BREAKDOWN 
EVERYTHING'S FLASHING 
ALL THE CAMERAS ARE GOING CRAZY 
LOOKS LIKE AN INFRARED DISCO 
BUT IT'S NOT VERY GOOD FOR FILMING OTTERS 
HAVE TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE 
BUT THIS MIGHT BE THE MAGICAL FIX 
VERY VERY BRIGHT INFRARED LIGHT 
HEY JOHN PERHAPS THERE'S A POLTERGEIST OUT THERE 
LOOK I'LL LEAVE YOU TO HANDLE THAT BECAUSE I'M OFF ON A BIT OF A SPOOKY MISSION MYSELF 
SURELY IF ANYWHERE WERE A HOME FOR GHOSTS THIS IS IT 
SHAPES SHADOWS AND SOUNDS 
OH JUST JACKDAWS 
I MEAN JACKDAWS YEAH MIGHT MAKE YOU JUMP BUT AT LEAST YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE 
BUT IT'S THE NOISES YOU DON'T RECOGNISE THAT ARE MORE DISTURBING 
WHAT WAS THAT 
OOH 
IT'S GOTTA BE A GHOST 
IT'S A BIT SCOOBY DOO BUT YOU KNOW 
NO OF COURSE IT ISN'T 
THAT'S JUST THE CALL OF ROCK DOVES 
OOH OOH OOH 
THERE YOU GO JUST A ROCK DOVE 
BUT IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A BIRD AND YOU BELIEVED IN GHOSTS 
AND YOU DID KNOW THAT THIS WAS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE HAD DIED 
IN FACT WHERE THEY'D BEEN MURDERED 
AND MAYBE YOU WERE HERE ALONE AT NIGHT AND YOU SUDDENLY HEARD 
OOH OOH 
WELL THAT'S HOW A GHOST STORY STARTS 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT MANY NO MOST WELL QUITE POSSIBLY ALL 
TALES OF GHOSTS SPOOKS BANSHEES AND SPIRITS TURN OUT TO BE WILDLIFE 
SO IS THIS THE SOUND OF LOST SOULS TRAPPED FOR ETERNITY OR THE TORTURED CRIES OF THE UNDEAD 
NO OF COURSE IT ISN'T IT'S THE COURTSHIP CALLS OF THE BARN OWL 
EVEN LOOKS A BIT LIKE A GHOST REALLY DOESN'T IT 
AND WHAT ABOUT THIS SOUND 
SOME KIND OF VOODOO WORSHIP OR PERHAPS INHUMAN SCREAMS FROM THE GATES OF HELL 
NO IT'S ACTUALLY JUST A HEDGEHOG 
IT'S AN AGGRESSIVE HEDGEHOG YES BUT IT'S STILL THE SAME LITTLE 
CREATURE THAT POTTERS AROUND THE GARDENS AT NIGHT SAVAGELY DEVOURING NICE JUICY SLUGS 
AND WHAT IS THIS 
THE BLOOD CURDLING HOWL OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WEREWOLF 
OR JUST A COUPLE OF URBAN FOXES HAVING A BIT OF A SCRAP IN THE MATING SEASON 
AND FINALLY HOW ABOUT THIS 
A CLASSIC CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY 
YOU SEE IN DAYS GONE BY AS PEOPLE LAY IN THEIR DEATHBEDS 
MANY THOUGHT THAT THIS TAPPING WAS THE APPROACHING SOUND OF THE GRIM REAPER 
BUT IN FACT IT'S PRODUCED BY A PARTICULAR KIND OF BEETLE 
A BEETLE THAT SOUNDED SO EERIE IT WAS NAMED THE DEATH WATCH BEETLE 
NOW HEAVEN KNOWS I DON'T WANT BE A SCEPTIC AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANNA BE A SPOILSPORT 
BUT LISTEN NEXT TIME YOU THINK MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD A GHOST 
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN IT WASN'T ONE OF THESE 
EEK EEK OOH OOH HOWL 
SO WHAT WILDLIFE COULD BE MISTAKEN FOR GHOSTS H. M. M. 
OWLS BATS 
CROWS AND RAVENS ARE SORT OF A BIT EERIE 
THE ESCAPED PUMAS 
GHOSTS EXIST I DON'T DOUBT 
IT'S ALL IN THE MIND 
PEOPLE GET SPOOKED WITH BATS 
KIND OF REALLY STRANGE WHAT IS THAT SOUND 
OF COURSE IN CRUMBLING MANSIONS AND GRAVEYARDS 
IT'S EASY TO BE SPOOKED BY THE SLIGHTEST SQUEAK BUT WHAT ABOUT OUT AT SEA 
I MEAN IT'S NOT REALLY WHERE YOU'D EXPECT TO HEAR BANSHEES WAILING 
BUT THERE AREN'T MANY EERIER SOUNDS THAN THE SONGS OF GREY SEALS' 
BOTH I AND ACE SOUND MAN CHRIS WATSON HAVE SAILED OUT TO THE SEALS 
OFF THE NORTHUMBERLAND COAST MANY TIMES BEFORE 
BUT WE'VE NEVER GOT THIS CLOSE 
AND THIS IS CHRIS'S CHANCE TO RECORD THE SEALS' FIRST ALBUM 
JUST HAVE A LISTEN TO THAT 
AH IT'S SUCH A SPOOKY SOUND I MEAN 
SO HUMAN YEAH BUT ALSO YOU KNOW I MEAN GHOSTLY 
OR WHAT WE'VE COME TO ACCEPT AS GHOSTLY 
IT'S GOT ALL THOSE QUALITIES IT'S HAUNTING AND SORT OF ETHEREAL 
AND IT MIXES IN WITH THE SOUNDS OF THE SEA IT SORT OF DRIFTS AND FADES 
OOH OOH I'M SO SAD YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THAT 
BUT IT'S ALSO I THINK VERY ALLURING 
NOW IF YOU IMAGINE YOU'RE DRIFTING PAST SOME ROCKS 
BUT WOULD YOU GO TOWARDS IT 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I WOULD OR YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY YOU MIGHT THINK 
OH THAT PERSON'S CALLING TO ME THEY NEED MY HELP AND COMFORT 
MAYBE OOH COME HERE YEAH YEAH YEAH MAYBE 
I MEAN PERSONALLY I WOULDN'T BUT 
OH I WAS GONNA SAY I THINK YOU'VE BEEN AT SEA A LOT LONGER THAN ME 
IS IT A SONG 
YOU KNOW IN THE SENSE THAT WE THINK A BIRD HAS A SONG WE CALL IT A SONG IS IT A SONG 
I DON'T THINK IT IS IT'S A COMMUNICATION IT'S A VOCALISATION 
BUT THE INTERESTING THING I THINK IS ONE WILL STIMULATE THE OTHER 
AND THEY'LL DO IT AS A GROUP IT'S NOT LIKE INDIVIDUAL BIRDSONG 
NO IT'S IT'S A CHORUS IT'S A CHORAL THING 
THERE IT IS AGAIN IT'S COME TO ME COME TO ME COME TO ME 
WELL I THINK THAT IS A SAD PLEA 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE SAYING YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T GOT A BABY 
I AIN'T GOT A HUSBAND 
YOU SEE THEY IDENTIFIED WITH THAT 
IF YOU GIVE ME THE HEADPHONES THIS IS BRILLIANT I WANNA RECORD THIS 
ONE THING IS FOR CERTAIN IT IS ONLY THE FEMALE'S MOAN LIKE THIS 
THE MALES WHEN THEY ARRIVE SORT OF ROAR AND BELLOW AS 
MALE ANIMALS ARE WONT TO DO SO THIS IS A LADIES' ONLY CHOIR 
IN WHICH CASE HOW DO THEY FEEL ABOUT ME JOINING IN H. M. M. 
THEY'RE DEFINITELY REACTING WHEN YOU SING TO THEM 
YEAH SHALL I TRY SINGING NORMALLY 
RED SEALS IN THE SUNSET 
I DON'T KNOW THE REST OF THE WORDS 
BUT ARE YOU AS INTERESTED WHEN I SING LIKE THIS 
NO I HAVE TO TAKE MY HEADPHONES OFF SORRY 
YES WELL I'M OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT TOO BUTCH FOR THAT CHOIR 
ANYWAY WHERE WAS I 
OH FLIPPING HECK 
YUP JOHN AITCHISON STUCK IN A HIDE LIGHTS FLASHING ON AND OFF 
I'D FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT HIM 
ANY LIFE OUT THERE 
OH IT'S A BAT 
LIKE THE DAUBENTONS THEY LIKE RIVERS 
I THINK THEY'LL EVEN PICK INSECTS OFF THE SURFACE SOMETIMES 
IT'S QUITE NICE BEING IN A HIDE AT NIGHT LIKE THIS 
AND NOT REALLY BEING ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING 
BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU SO MUCH MORE AWARE OF SOUND 
IT'S LIKE HAVING EXTRA ACUTE HEARING AND HEARING EXTRA GURGLES AND THINGS 
IN THE RIVER THAT I THINK I WOULDN'T NOTICE OTHERWISE AND SPLASHES 
AND THINGS DROP ON THE ROOF AND MAKE ME JUMP 
IT MUST BE LIKE THAT BEING AN OTTER AT NIGHT 
BECAUSE REALLY THEY'VE ONLY GOT THEIR EARS OR THEIR NOSES TO USE TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE WORLD 
I QUITE LIKE IMAGINING THEM OUT THERE 
SENSING THIS PLACE IN THE DARK 
WHAT AM I DOING SITTING ON A RIVER BANK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TALKING TO MYSELF 
OH NO I'M TALKING TO YOU AREN'T I 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT 
NOT QUITE SO MAD AS IT SEEMS 
WONDER WHAT BILL'S UP TO 
THINK I'LL SEND HIM A TEXT 
HELLO BILL IN THE HIDE 
WISH YOU WERE HERE JOHN 
HEY NONE OF THAT 
IT'S FOUR IN THE MORNING NOW 
AND I CAN HEAR SOMETHING SWIMMING OUTSIDE THE HIDE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S AN OTTER I CAN'T TELL 
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE THAT WOULD BE SWIMMING OUT HERE 
NO NO IT'S NOT AN OTTER IT'S A RAT 
INTERESTING THOUGH QUITE BUSY 
IT'S GETTING LIGHT NOW 
THE FIRST BIRD 
FUNNY YOU MUST JUST PASS SOME THRESHOLD 
AND SUDDENLY IT'S LIGHT ENOUGH TO SING 
IT'S THE FIRST ROBIN IT'S THE FIRST LITTLE NOTES 
IT'S QUITE NICE TO HAVE THE COMPANY ACTUALLY IT'S BEEN SO QUIET HERE 
FEELS I'M SURE IT'S NOT THE CASE BUT IT FEELS LIKE IT'S JUST ME 
NOTHING ELSE ALIVE 
BUT SUDDENLY NOW THERE ARE BIRDS 
IT'S NICE 
WHAT WAS IT BILL SAID 
TRY AND FILM OTTERS ON A RIVER AT NIGHT 
H. M. M. 
WELL I FILMED THE RIVER AND IT WAS AT NIGHT 
SO IT COULD BE WORSE I SUPPOSE 
IT'S TWO OUT OF THREE 
ACTUALLY I THINK HE DID VERY WELL 
I MEAN CONSIDERING THAT NOBODY'S SEEN ANY OTTERS ROUND THERE FOR QUITE A WHILE 
A COUPLE OF YEARS ACTUALLY 
OOH AND ANYWAY LOOK A ROBIN THE PERFECT LINK INTO MY GARDEN VIDEO DIARY 
NOW I DARE SAY THAT MANY PEOPLE'S FAVOURITE BIRD IS THIS ONE THE ROBIN 
YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT THEM IN YOUR GARDEN 
WELL SO HAVE I AND UNLIKE SAY OTTERS AT NIGHT ROBINS POSE FOR THEIR CLOSE UPS 
ALL YOU'VE GOTTA DO IS GET THE FOCUS SORTED OUT 
THAT'S BETTER 
NICE AND CLEAR WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT EH JOHN AITCHISON 
H. M. M. YES ANYWAY FAIR ENOUGH 
IT ISN'T EXACTLY A CHALLENGE I AGREE JUST PUT OUT A BIT OF FOOD AND VOILA THE ROBIN 
IN FACT THOUGH I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET MY ROBINS TO TAKE MEALWORMS FROM MY HAND 
ALMOST THERE COME ON COME ON 
OOH NOT QUITE YET NOT QUITE 
YOU SEE I ONLY HAVE A SMALL GARDEN AND THAT MEANS THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR ONE PAIR OF ROBINS NO MORE 
INTRUDERS ARE SEEN OFF IMMEDIATELY 
MOST YEARS THEY NEST IN THE GARDEN AND WHAT THEY APPRECIATE IS LOTS OF TANGLY SHADY IVY 
IT WAS LAST APRIL WHEN I FIRST NOTICED THAT ROBINS WERE CHECKING OUT THE IVY ABOVE THE BACK DOOR 
THERE WAS LOTS OF HOVERING ALMOST LIKE HUMMING BIRDS GOING IN AND OUT IN AND OUT 
SO I KNEW THERE WAS A NEST THERE 
I LEFT THEM IN PEACE FOR A WEEK OR TWO 
BUT THEN I SIMPLY HAD TO FIND OUT THEY WERE TAKING FOOD IN 
SO LITHE AS A MOUNTAIN GOAT I LEAPED UP ON THE FLAT ROOF 
OH 
CREPT ALONG 
PARTED THE IVY AND YES CHICKS 
BUT HOW MANY COME ON ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
OH MY BABIES 
WELL THE ROBINS' BABIES ACTUALLY 
BUT I DID START WORRYING ABOUT THEM IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE IN MY GARDEN 
THERE ARE RATS THERE ARE MAGPIES THERE ARE JAYS 
THERE ARE SQUIRRELS ALL OF THEM PARTIAL TO A NIBBLE OF BABY ROBIN 
TIME FOR THE ROBIN PROTECTION AGENCY TO MOVE IN 
IT'S NOT DIFFICULT YOU TOO CAN MAKE A CUSTOM BUILT ROBIN SECURITY CAGE 
ANIMAL TESTED TOO 
WELL IT WORKS ON PLASTIC PIGS 
I PUT IT UP 
ROBIN WATCHED ME 
THERE WE GO STRAIGHT IN 
NOW I'D LIKE TO THINK THEY WERE GRATEFUL FOR MY EFFORTS 
BUT APPARENTLY NOT GRATEFUL ENOUGH BECAUSE I HAD BEEN HOPING TO FILM 
THEM FLEDGING BUT I HAD TO GO AWAY FOR A WEEK AND WHEN I CAME BACK THE NEST WAS EMPTY 
AH I FEARED THE WORST BUT THEN AGAIN 
I HAVEN'T BEEN LURKING AROUND IN BUSHES FOR SIXTY YEARS 
WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO THINK LIKE A BABY BIRD SO I LURKED 
WHERE I'D EXPECT THEM TO LURK AND YES I WAS RIGHT 
LITTLE SPECKLY THINGS WITH NO RED BREAST YET 
BUT BEAUTIFULLY CAMOUFLAGED UNTIL THEY GO EXPLORING 
IT'S WEIRD REALLY 
THEY'VE BEEN BORN INTO A PSYCHEDELIC NIGHTMARE BUT THEY KNOW NO BETTER 
NORMAL GARDEN TO THEM 
ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK YOU'RE MEANT TO BE PLAYING WITH THE RATS 
YOU SEE THEIR PARENTS MIGHT EAT YOU FOR DINNER 
TALKING OF PARENTS LOOK AT THE STATE OF MOTHER ROBIN 
HALF BOLD LOST HER TAIL 
OH DEARIE ME IN FACT I RENAMED HER SCRUFFBAG 
AND I'M SURE SHE WOULDN'T WANT THE BRITISH PUBLIC SEEING HER LIKE THAT 
WELL NOTHING A GOOD MOULT WON'T PUT RIGHT 
D. A. D. A. 
THERE WE ARE THE ROBIN WE KNOW AND LOVE ALL READY TO TAKE HER PLACE ON A CHRISTMAS CARD 
THE JOY OF GARDEN BIRDS GETTING TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS FAMILIES 
IT'S NOT TO BE FAIR THE SORT OF INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP 
YOU'D HAVE WITH FOR EXAMPLE A CORNCRAKE 
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE LOOKING AFTER THEM FOR A REINTRODUCTION PROJECT 
NOW REMEMBER CASANOVA CORNCRAKE HAD DONE THE STUFF 
WITH MRS. C. AND THE RESULT WAS EGGS AND CHICKS 
WHO ARE NOW GROWN UP AND WAITING FOR THEIR SPECIAL DAY 
AND THAT DAY IS TODAY 
THESE ARE THE NENE WASHES IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE 
CLASSIC CORNCRAKE COUNTRY AND THAT WASN'T EASY TO SAY 
NOW SOMEWHERE IN HERE ARE YOUNG CORNCRAKES THAT ARE ACCLIMATISING 
THEMSELVES TO LIFE IN THE FENLANDS 
THEY ARE TOTALLY INVISIBLE 
THEY ARE IN HERE SOMEWHERE 
AH LOOK LOOK LOOK LOOK SOMETHING IN HERE 
THERE'S A PAIR OF ORNITHOLOGISTS 
THERE AREN'T MANY OF THESE IN CAPTIVITY AND THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY 
AFTER THEIR PREY AND THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING LOOK LOOK LOOK 
A CORNCRAKE 
REMARKABLE EYESIGHT 
RIGHT 
SURPRISINGLY DELICATE WITH THEIR FEET 
I CAN HEAR ANOTHER ONE HERE 
YEAH O. K. GOT IT 
THEY'VE SPOTTED IT HE'S GOT THE LAST ONE NUMBER FOUR 
NUMBER FOUR GOES INTO THE BAG AND BY THE WAY QUITE SERIOUSLY 
ONCE A BIRD IS IN A BAG IT WILL CALM DOWN 
IT'S NOT BEING HURT IN THAT BAG IT'S O. K. FAIR COP WAIT FOR THE NEXT PHASE 
AND WHAT IS THE NEXT PHASE 
WRIGGLING IN A BAG 
MUST BE MORE TO LIFE THAN THAT 
JUST HANG ON HANG ON HANG ON 
THEY'RE BEING GIVEN A FULL MEDICAL CHECK UP 
THE WEIGHT THE HEALTH 
THE FITNESS THE SIZE 
JUST TO LIVE OUT IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE 
WELL IN FACT THEY'VE GOT A JOURNEY COMING UP WHICH AND THIS 
IS THE AMAZING THING WHICH IS A GREAT DEAL MORE DEMANDING THAN JUST FLAPPING ACROSS A FIELD HERE 
THESE BIRDS ARE GONNA HAVE TO FLY SOUTH TO CENTRAL AFRICA 
SO IN A SENSE THIS IS LIKE A BUNCH OF ASTRONAUTS HAVING THEIR CHECK UPS 
BEFORE THEY GO ON AN AMAZING ADVENTURE 
RHYS IT'S THE MOST ELABORATE MEDICAL 
I KNOW THIS SCHEME'S BEEN GOING FOR FIVE SIX YEARS IS IT 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT WHAT SORT OF A SUCCESS HAVE YOU HAD SO FAR 
EVERY YEAR NOW SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR WE'VE HAD CORNCRAKES IN THE WILD ON THE NENE 
WASHES AND THE OTHER GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT 
WELL WE KNOW ACTUALLY THAT THEY'VE BRED SUCCESSFULLY HERE 
ANY CHANCE OF SAYING GOODBYE TO ONE MYSELF 
I THINK THAT COULD BE ARRANGED BILL THANK YOU 
LISTEN TO ME 
THERE'S GOOD NEWS YEAH AND BAD NEWS 
NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU'LL SOON BE BASKING IN THE AFRICAN SUN 
BUT THE BAD NEWS IS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET THERE YOURSELF 
NO SAT NAV NO MAPS AND LET'S FACE IT 
YOU DON'T EXACTLY LOOK LIKE YOU'RE BUILT FOR FLYING DO YOU 
LITTLE STUBBY WINGS AND GREAT BIG GANGLY LEGS 
BUT GENERATIONS OF CORNCRAKES BEFORE YOU HAVE DONE IT O. K. 
AND HERE'S THE EVEN BETTER NEWS FOR US IF YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS MAKE IT 
THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE WILL ONCE AGAIN ECHO 
WITH THE SOUND OF CRKK CRKK 
NOW SAVE YOUR ENERGY YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT 
GOOD LUCK MATE 
A HAPPY ENDING OR A NEW BEGINNING 
NEXT TIME MORE BIRDS ON THE MENU 
WE'RE NOT GONNA EAT YOU 
AND 
IT'S RATHER WET JOHN AITCHISON MOANING AGAIN 
PLUS 
WOW 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY 
BRACE YOURSELVES THE COMPETITION IS HOTTING UP 
YOU'RE SHOWING US ALL THE COLOURS OF NANCY 
ONCE AGAIN YOU JUST BLEW ME AWAY YOU'RE A STAR 
THAT WAS EMOTIONALLY FANTASTIC FANTASTIC FANTASTIC 
JOIN GRAHAM NORTON FOR I'D DO ANYTHING 
HE'S GOOD AND I THINK THAT COMBO IN THE LOUNGE THAT IS HORRIBLE 
A HORSE A HORSE
