SOUL ON FIRE FROM SPIRITUALIZED 
FROM THE FORTHCOMING ALBUM SONGS IN A AND AMP E. 
AND NOW WE WELCOME FROM WEST BROMWICH AND FROM NASHVILLE 
ROBERT PLANT ALISON KRAUSS AND T. BONE BURNETT 
WELCOME TO THE SHOW IT'S FANTASTIC TO HAVE YOU ALL HERE 
IT'S A GREAT NOVELTY BEER FOR MR. BURNETT YEAH 
A GREAT NIGHT OUT IT'S SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK 
YOU CAME AND CHATTED BRIEFLY ON THE SHOW ABOUT THE RECORD 
AND THAT WAS AT THE EARLY POINT BUT NOW YOU HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY TOURING 
DONE YOUR FIRST DATE IN NEW ORLEANS WHICH IS GREAT 
I'M GOING TO ASK ONE OF YOU HOW IT GOES I'LL SPIN THE BOTTLE 
TO DECIDE WHO GETS THE QUESTION 
T. BONE T. BONE HOW'S THE TOURING GOING 
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN GOING BEAUTIFULLY 
WHAT I WANT TO SAY ABOUT 
WELL THERE'S A LOT TO SAY 
BUT ROBERT WHEN HE FIRST CALLED ME ABOUT THIS BAND 
I'M NOT GONNA SAY ALL THAT IT'S BEEN GOING GREAT 
WHAT DID HE FIRST SAY HOW DID HE FIRST 
WELL WHEN ROBERT FIRST CALLED UP HE SAID YOU KNOW 
ALISON AND I ARE DOING A RECORD BUT WE WANT TO DO IT AS A BAND 
AND I HAVE TO SAY IT'S BECOME A BAND 
AND IT'S THE MOST FUN I'VE EVER HAD PLAYING MUSIC 
WELL THE BAND SOUNDS GREAT THERE'S MORE TO DO YET 
ALISON HOW IS IT WORKING THERE'S LOTS OF MEN IN THIS BAND 
DOES IT GET A BIT SORT OF BORING ON TOUR 
JUST ENDLESS MEN NO GIRLS TO TALK TO 
WELL YOU KNOW I GET THE BATHROOM TO MYSELF 
YES AND THAT'S A NICE TREAT 
WHAT IS IT LIKE SINGING WITH ROBERT HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT 
OH GOSH IT'S A VERY INTERESTING COMBINATION I THINK 
I COME FROM ONE WORLD HE COMES FROM ANOTHER 
AND PUTTING THE TWO TOGETHER 
IT'S STILL JUST SINGING FROM YOUR HEART AND YOU KNOW 
HARMONISING WHICH IS SOMETHING I GREW UP DOING 
BUT IT'S A FASCINATING COMBINATION TO COME TOGETHER FROM SUCH DIFFERENT WORLDS 
DO YOU FEEL AS IF YOU'RE COMING FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS 
UNDOUBTEDLY YEAH BUT YOU KNOW UM 
THE CHALLENGE IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
I THINK THE THREE OF US OUR HISTORIES 
ARE ALL ABOUT TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS GOING TO NEW PLACES 
AND YEAH YOU KNOW THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD 
WOULD BE JUST TO BE A ONE TRICK PONY 
AND TO DIVE IN WITH THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY COMING FROM ANOTHER PLACE IS FASCINATING 
AND INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING 
AND NOW THE FRUITS ARE THERE WE'VE HAD SUCH A BALL 
AND IT'S FUNNY THAT'S THE GREAT THING 
I MEAN WE'RE HERE NOW TALKING ABOUT A PROJECT BUT IT'S GREAT FUN 
THESE GUYS THAT WE'RE PLAYING WITH HERE YOU KNOW 
THAT'S AMERICAN HISTORY THERE REALLY 
THE OTHER THING YOU DID HAVE TO BREAK OFF BEFORE 
TO GO AND YOU DID A LED ZEPPELIN CONCERT IN THE MEANTIME 
WAS THAT VERY DIVERTING FOR YOU TO GO AND HAVE TO DO THAT 
ER NO IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE'D PLANNED TO DO 
ANOTHER THING TO DO DO YOU DO LED ZEPPELIN SONGS WITH THIS BAND 
ONLY WITH A MANDOLIN YEAH 
OR IS IT THE BANJO OR THE FLUTE 
DO YOU PLAY OTHER INSTRUMENTS ME YES 
ER HANDCUFFS 
ALWAYS GET A NICE TUNE OUT OF THEM 
WE HAVE GOT A BIT OF WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOME FOOTAGE 
COS THERE ISN'T REALLY FOOTAGE THAT RELATES TO ALL OF YOU 
SO WE THOUGHT WE'D CELEBRATE SOMEBODY WHO WE DON'T SEE SO MUCH 
BUT WHO DID WORK WITH LED ZEPPELIN SANDY DENNY 
SHE DID WORK WITH YOU ON LED ZEPPELIN THE FOURTH I THINK IT WAS 
WE'VE GOT A CLIP OF HER NOW LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
MISSED THE MORNING TOO DIDN'T RISE BEFORE NOON 
SHE'S A LAZY LADY TODAY 
ALWAYS YAWNING YOU WITH YOUR EYES 
ON THE MOON 
YOU'RE A CRAZY LADY I'D SAY 
D. A. DUM D. A. D. A. 
IT'S THIRTY YEARS SADLY SINCE HER DEATH 
AND THAT WAS A RATHER GOOD CLIP WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF HER 
WELL I JUST KNOW THAT SHE WAS 
I THINK LIKE SO MANY OF OUR CONTEMPORARIES NO MATTER WHAT AGE 
YOU JUST DON'T HAVE ANY ESTIMATION OF HOW REMARKABLE THE GIFT IS 
AND HOW IT AFFECTS YOU KNOW 
I MEAN THE PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW 
WE'D BEEN WORKING ON STUFF WITH TOWNES VAN ZANDT 
YOU GET ALL THESE FANTASTIC ARTISTS WHO HAVE NO IDEA 
AND WRAP THEMSELVES IN SORT OF SELF DOUBT AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT 
AND SHE WAS SPECTACULAR 
YEAH IT SOUND ALSO TO ME THERE 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE 
OR NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE OR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTY FIVE 
IT'S OF NO TIMELESS YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT REALLY 
TO TRY AND CREATE STUFF THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY HANG ON TO AN IDIOM 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE MOVING THROUGH THE SPHERES 
MY LAST QUESTION T. BONE YOU'VE PRODUCED SOME FANTASTIC PEOPLE 
WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU IS THIS 
I WAS A GREAT FAN OF YOURS AND A FAN OF T. BONE WALKER 
WHERE DID YOU GET THE NAME T. BONE FROM I'VE TOLD SO MANY LIES BY NOW I DON'T TIME FOR ANOTHER

OUR PARENTS WOULD TREAT US WITH CARROTS AND STICKS 
JUST TWO ALCOHOLICS UP TO THEIR OLD TRICKS 
MUM PLAYED PIANO SHE LOVED GRACIE FIELDS 
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FAMOUS BUT WE DRAGGED AT HER HEELS 
MY DAD WAS A BIG MAN UNSHAVEN AND STRONG 
HE LOVED TO HEAR GRACIE AS SHE SANG A SONG 
THE PUB ON A SUNDAY WAS WHERE SHE WOULD SING 
AND WE'D SIT OUTSIDE TILL THE LAST BELL WOULD RING 
MY BROTHER WAS GIFTED HE HAD A GREAT VOICE 
NOT LIKE THE OTHER YOUNG BATTERSEA BOYS 
HE KNEW EVERY OPERA AND SANG IN THE STREETS 
AND WITH SALLY'S ARMY HE PLAYED TAMBOURINE 
PUB ON A SUNDAY IS WHERE THEY WOULD SING 
AND THEY'D JOIN TOGETHER TILL THE LAST BELL WOULD RING 
WHEN HE WAS FOURTEEN MY BROTHER WAS SENT 
TO THE SALVATION ARMY TO LIVE WITH HIS FRIENDS 
DAD COULD NOT TAKE IT HE CALLED HIM A POOF 
FOR SINGING PUCCINI SO MISUNDERSTOOD 
MY BROTHER WAS GIFTED HE HAD A GREAT VOICE 
NOT LIKE THE OTHER YOUNG BATTERSEA BOYS 
HE STUDIED HIS MUSIC WE KEPT IN TOUCH 
STILL HAD THAT OLD STREAM OF BROTHERLY LOVE 
HE SINGS FOR HIS SUPPER HE STILL WANTS TO BE 
A VOICE ON THE BIG STAGE WITH HIS OWN C. D. 
OUR PARENTS ARE LONG GONE COLD IN THE GROUND 
I SERVED TIME IN PRISON BUT THEY WEREN'T AROUND 
I LOVE MY SWEET BROTHER HIS VOICE MAKES ME CRY 
WE SING FOR FORGIVENESS AS TIME PASSES US BY 
MY BROTHER WAS GIFTED HE HAD A GREAT VOICE 
NOT LIKE THE OTHER YOUNG BATTERSEA BOYS 
MY BROTHER WAS GIFTED HE HAD A GREAT VOICE 
NOT LIKE THE OTHER YOUNG BATTERSEA BOYS 
NOT LIKE THE OTHER YOUNG BATTERSEA BOYS 
LEAVES WERE FALLING 
JUST LIKE EMBERS 
IN COLOURS RED AND GOLD 
THEY SET US ON FIRE 
BURNING JUST LIKE MOONBEAMS 
IN OUR EYES 
SOMEBODY SAID THEY SAW ME 
SWINGING THE WORLD BY THE TAIL 
BOUNCING OVER A WHITE CLOUD 
KILLING THE BLUES 
NOW I'M GUILTY OF SOMETHING 
I HOPE YOU'D NEVER DO 
BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING 
SADDER THAN LOSING YOURSELF IN LOVE 
SOMEBODY SAID THEY SAW ME 
SWINGING THE WORLD BY THE TAIL 
BOUNCING OVER A WHITE CLOUD 
KILLING THE BLUES 
AND NOW YOU ASK ME JUST TO LEAVE YOU 
TO GO OUT ON MY OWN 
AND GET WHAT I NEED TO 
YOU WANT ME TO FIND WHAT I'VE ALREADY HAD 
SOMEBODY SAID THEY SAW ME 
SWINGING THE WORLD BY THE TAIL 
BOUNCING OVER A WHITE CLOUD 
KILLING THE BLUES

WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING SOMETHING FOR US FROM

RIGHT ONE OF MY EX HUSBANDS 
HE WAS REALLY MY FIRST PRODUCER HE PRODUCED PIECES OF THE SKY AND OTHER RECORDS

PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK IT'S SURPRISING THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AGAIN 
BUT WE ARE GREAT FRIENDS AND I LOVE WORKING WITH HIM SO IT WAS GREAT 
AND IT'S LOVELY IT SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THOSE EARLY EMMYLOU RECORDS 
WHAT WAS IT THAT FIRST MADE YOU WANT TO GO SOLO 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT YOU KNOW IT WAS THE ERA OF JOAN BAEZ 
AND I JUST GOT A GUITAR AND I WANTED TO BE THE NEXT JOAN BAEZ 
BUT REALLY IT WASN'T UNTIL I MET GRAM PARSONS AND STARTED SINGING HARMONY WITH HIM 
THAT I THINK I REALLY FOUND MY TRUE VOICE AND MY PASSION 
THROUGH HARMONY SINGING AND COUNTRY MUSIC 
WHICH ALSO ENCOMPASSES FOLK AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS 
BUT IT WAS REALLY THAT AND I DIDN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT BEING A SOLO ARTIST 
I JUST WANTED TO SING WITH GRAM BUT HE DIED QUITE YOUNG 
AND I WAS JUST LEFT WITH A LOT OF MUSIC I WANTED TO DO 
AND I KIND OF HAD TO CONTINUE ON ON MY OWN 
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST PLAYED AT THE B. B. C. 
UM IT WAS EITHER WAS IT SEVENTY FIVE OR SEVENTY SIX 
IT WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE I THINK O. K. 
THAT'S THE INFORMATION I HAVE AND IN FACT WE'VE GOT IT RIGHT HERE 
OH DEAR NO OH GOOD OH GOOD O. K. 
OH AMARILLO WHAT D'YOU WANT MY BABY FOR 
OH AMARILLO NOW HE WON'T COME HOME NO MORE 
YOU DONE PLAYED A TRICK ON ME 
HOOKED HIM IN THE FIRST DEGREE 
WHILE HE PUT ANOTHER QUARTER 
PUSH DOLLY AND THEN PORTER 
WHILE HE RACKS UP FIFTY THOUSAND ON THE PINBALL MACHINE 
THAT WAS GREAT 
THAT WAS FANTASTIC REALLY
