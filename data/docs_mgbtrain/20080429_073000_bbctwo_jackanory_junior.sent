ELLIE HAD LIVED IN MORE HOUSES AND BEEN TO MORE SCHOOLS 
THAN ANY EIGHT PEOPLE PUT TOGETHER 
IT'S NOT FAIR SHE KICKED A STONE AS SHE WALKED TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE 
I HATE SCHOOL I HATE THIS HOUSE I HATE EVERYTHING ELLIE SAID 
THE DINING ROOM WAS ON THE FIRST FLOOR OVERLOOKING THE BACK GARDEN

THIS SAUSAGE IS TOO SMALL 
AND THE BEANS SHOULDN'T BE TOUCHING THE CHIPS YUK
