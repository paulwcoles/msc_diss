THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A DAY AT THE RACES THOUGH IAN 
MANDY'S GOT HER OWN RACEHORSES 
WILL SHE GIVE US SOME INSIDE TIPS 
WHAT ON HOW TO FIND PROPERTIES WE DON'T NEED THAT 
SO MANDY AND KATIE HERE WE ARE IN YOUR LOVELY GARDEN 
WHY ARE WE MOVING I SAY TO MYSELF 
WELL I'VE GOT TO GET ON THE PROPERTY LADDER 
I'VE FINISHED MY DEGREE TOUCH WOOD SO NOW WE NEED TO FIND ME SOMEWHERE 
YOU'VE BEEN AT UNIVERSITY YOU'VE WORKED HARD 
YOU'VE FINISHED YOUR STUDIES YOU'RE GOING OUT INTO THE BIG BAD WORLD 
GETTING A JOB A MORTGAGE DEBT UNHAPPINESS 
SO THIS IS A BIG STEP FOR YOU THEN 
YEP IT IS A BIG STEP FOR ME IT'S A BIG STEP FOR US SHE'S FLYING THE NEST MUM ABSOLUTELY 
SO YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN USED TO KATIE BEING AWAY A BIT 
YES I HAVE SHE'S BEEN AT UNI FOR FIVE YEARS BUT SHE'S ALWAYS COME HOME AT WEEKENDS 
SHE LIKES NOT TO BE TOO FAR AWAY DON'T YOU 
SO THIS IS GONNA BE A BIT OF A STRAIN ON YOU BOTH YES POSSIBLY 
I THINK SHE'LL BE HOPEFULLY LOCAL 
AND I THINK I'VE GOT MY NAME ON A FEW THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED 
O. K. SO YOU'RE LOOKING TO MOVE BUT NOT TOO FAR AWAY FROM MUM AND DAD 
WE'LL LOOK IN THE DROITWICH AREA PREFERABLY 
O. K. SO DROITWICH TELL ME WHAT'S LOVELY ABOUT DROITWICH 
WELL I MEAN IT'S REALLY CLOSE TO BIRMINGHAM AND WORCESTER IT'S A PERFECT DISTANCE 
FANTASTIC LOCATION REALLY FOR THE MOTORWAY 
THE MOTORWAY IS LITERALLY FIVE MINUTES FROM ANYWHERE IN DROITWICH PRETTY MUCH 
SO IT'S NOT TOO BUILT UP AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL AREA BUT YOU'RE NEAR THE BIG CITY YES 
THE REASON YOU LIKE THE COUNTRYSIDE IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE A KEEN INTEREST WHICH IS HORSERACING 
WE HAVE SOME HORSES WHICH WE WATCH BUT WE GO ANYWHERE DON'T WE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO RACES 
I COULD'VE BEEN A CHAMPIONSHIP JOCKEY GOT THE BUILD FOR IT 
YEAH I COULD SEE YOU IN ONE OF THOSE SATIN STRIPY JOBBIES 
THAT'S DIFFERENT AND SOMETHING YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT IN YOUR OWN TIME JENNY THANK YOU IAN I AM WARPED 
WHAT KIND OF HOUSE WOULD YOU IDEALLY WANT 
I'M NOT THAT FUSSY REALLY AM I 
I'D RATHER HAVE SOMEWHERE THAT'S CLEAN AND ALL I HAD TO DO WAS A FEW LICKS OF PAINT HERE AND THERE 
I HAVE TO GIVE YOU A WARNING THERE NEVER SAY TO US YOU'RE NOT FUSSY 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH 
TELL US WHAT YOU DEFINITELY DON'T WANT WHY DON'T WE START WITH THAT 
O. K. I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT A FRONT DOOR THAT OPENS UP INTO A ROOM 
EVEN IF IT'S JUST AT LEAST A LITTLE HALLWAY I HATE THE FRONT DOOR IN THE LOUNGE 
IF WE FIND A LOVELY HOUSE WHERE WE COULD BUILD A HALLWAY WOULD THAT BE O. K. 
YEAH BIT OF A PORCH IF IT WAS IN THE BUDGET 
VERY GOOD I DON'T MIND PAINTING BUT I DON'T WANT TO START RIPPING OUT KITCHENS AND BATHROOMS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ANY SORT OF KITCHEN AS LONG AS IT'S A GOOD SHAPE 
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE SO LONG AS IT'S IN THE BUDGET 
YOU WANT OFF ROAD PARKING 
FOR TWO CARS PREFERABLY TWO OR THREE BEDROOMS 
TWO BEDROOMS DEFINITELY THREE WOULD BE A BONUS 
EVEN IF I HAVE TO USE THE THIRD ROOM SPACE AS AN EN SUITE I'D RATHER THAT 
OOH YOU DO LIKE THE FINER THINGS IN LIFE EH 
NOW WHAT ABOUT YOUR DOG 
THE DOG WELL HE NEEDS A GARDEN 
IT'S NOT MY DOG BUT WHEN HE COMES 
YOU'RE HAVING A DOG SHARE 
SO ALL WE NEED FOR A DOG IS A GARDEN SO WE NEED A BIT OF A GARDEN 
AND SORT OF LOCATION WISE WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE NEAR ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR 
NOT REALLY AS LONG AS I CAN GET TO WORK 
THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN REALLY BUT I'D RATHER NOT BE RIGHT ON A MAIN ROAD I WANNA GET A CAT 
YOU WANNA GET A CAT DO YOU 
O. K. YOU SEE WHEN SHE LEAVES HOME SHE CAN DO WHAT SHE LIKES 
MUM I'VE GOT A NOSE RING AND A MOHICAN AND A CAT 
ALL RIGHT THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WE HAVEN'T COVERED 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT YOUR BUDGET IS 
WELL WE'VE DECIDED AROUND ONE EIGHTY FIVE K. THAT'S THE MOST 
BUT YOU KNOW IF THE GUIDE PRICE WAS MORE WE COULD OFFER 
O. K. SO ONE EIGHTY FIVE K. IS THE MOST YOU'VE GOT TO SPEND 
IF WE FIND SOMETHING WE THINK WE MIGHT MAKE A CHEEKY LITTLE OFFER THEN WE'LL BE O. K. ALL RIGHT FINE 
WE OUGHT TO GIVE IT A GO REALLY 
SHALL WE GET ON WITH IT LET'S GET ON OUR HORSE AND DRINK OUR MILK 
VERY GOOD IN THE WORDS OF JOHN WAYNE I FEEL 
ALL RIGHT WE'LL SEE YOU LATER 
I SEE TROUBLE AHEAD YOU KNOW 
BECAUSE THIS IS KATIE'S BOOK AND LIKE A TYPICAL GIRL SHE SAID I'LL KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT 
WE DO KNOW A COUPLE OF THINGS DON'T WE 
TWO BEDROOMS OFF ROAD PARKING FOR AT LEAST TWO CARS 
AND A FRONT DOOR THAT DOESN'T GO INTO THE LIVING AREA 
INTO ANY ROOM IN FACT WHAT ARE THE ODDS ON THAT 
WELL I'D IMAGINE THE ODDS ARE ABOUT THREE TO ONE AND THE GOING IS DEFINITELY GOOD 
AND IN THE WORDS OF JOHN WAYNE WHEN THE GOING GET'S TOUGH THE TOUGH GET'S GOING 
THAT WAS BILLY OCEAN 
NOW DROITWICH SPA IT'S SIX AND A HALF MILES NORTH EAST OF WORCESTER 
AND TWENTY ONE MILES SOUTH WEST OF BIRMINGHAM 
DROITWICH MEANS PLACE OF SALT IT GETS ITS NAME FROM THE TIME ROMANS OCCUPIED THE AREA 
AND EXPORTED THE VERY VALUABLE COMMODITY 
THE VICTORIANS ALSO TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE SPA'S BRINE 
THE WATER HERE IS AS SALTY AS THAT OF THE DEAD SEA PERFECT FOR SOME RELAXING FLOTATION 
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THAT THE BENEFITS OF FLOATING AROUND IN BRINE WERE APPRECIATED AND BRINE BATHS WERE BUILT 
IT WAS A CHAP CALLED JOHN CORBETT WHO TURNED DROITWICH INTO A FASHIONABLE SPA TOWN 
HE WAS A SALT KING AND AN M. P. 
HE USED HIS STATUS TO PROMOTE DROITWICH AS A HEALTH RESORT 
AND IT WAS JOHN CORBETT WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING DROITWICH'S VERY OWN CHATEAU BACK IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE 
NO EXPENSE WAS SPARED AND THREE THOUSAND MEN WERE EMPLOYED TO BUILD IT 
IT WAS MEANT TO BE A HOME FOR HIS FRENCH WIFE BUT IT'S SAID THAT ON COMPLETION SHE REFUSED TO LIVE THERE 
I HOPE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO US TODAY JENNY 
THERE ARE SOME GRAND PLACES HERE 
BUT DON'T FRET BECAUSE YOUR AVERAGE SEMI STILL COMES IN AT UNDER TWO HUNDRED K. 
THAT'S NOT BAD AT ALL BUT WILL KATIE'S ONE EIGHTY FIVE K. GET HER A CHATEAU ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE U. K. 
WELL IT'S NOT QUITE A CHATEAU J. P. BUT IT'S NOT FAR OFF 
ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT IT'S GOT BAGS OF CHARACTER AND CHARM WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
VERY NICE AND IF YOU'D BUILD IT FOR ME I'D DEFINITELY MOVE IN 
AS IT'S ONLY ONE EIGHTY FIVE K. 
WHAT ABOUT THIS LITTLE BEAUTY IN LINCOLN 
SURELY YOU WOULDN'T REFUSE TO MOVE IN HERE 
WELL IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY MEN YOU HAD WORKING ON IT IAN 
YOU KNOW ME AND BUNGALOWS 
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND FINALLY A NEWLY BUILT THREE BED SORT OF CHATEAU TOWN HOUSE 
IN THIS SOUGHT AFTER DEVELOPMENT IN THE WEST OF NORWICH 
JENNY JUST TELL US HOW MUCH IT IS 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
RIGHT O. K. BACK TO DROITWICH SPA THEN 
I'M JONATHAN JONATHAN GOOD TO MEET YOU I'M ON THE LOOK OUT FOR PROPERTY FOR A FIRST TIME BUYER 
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO ARE YOU SHOPPING SHOPPING 
YOU'RE GOING TO A SHOPPING CENTRE AND I ASK YOU A STUPID QUESTION LIKE THAT 
I'M STUPID AREN'T I YOU ARE STUPID THANK YOU 
SHE'S GOT THE FUNDS IN PLACE SHE'S READY TO GO SHE WANTS TO LIVE AROUND DROITWICH 
HELLO HOW ARE YOU I'M VERY WELL YOU'RE VERY SHOWBIZ 
YOU LOOK LIKE A FOOTBALLER'S WIFE IN DROITWICH THERE 
YOU MENTIONED OFF ROAD PARKING 
THAT HAS OFF ROAD PARKING WHICH IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR MILLER STREET AND IT'S VERY CLOSE TO THE TOWN 
LOOK AT YOU WHAT A LOVELY SMILE THAT IS A PROPER SMILER EVERYONE 
TAKE NOTE THAT'S A REAL GENUINE SMILE 
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO WALK STRAIGHT INTO THE FRONT ROOM 
THAT DOES DOESN'T IT IT DOES 
BUT IT IS A PERIOD PROPERTY AND DOES TICK EVERY OTHER BOX SO I MIGHT JUST SKIRT OVER THAT ONE 
PORCHES ARE A GOOD THING AREN'T THEY 
ARE YOU FROM DROITWICH YES 
I CAN'T SAY IT YOU KNOW DROITWICH TAKE THE T. OUT OF THE MIDDLE DROI W. I. C. H. OH THAT'S IT 
WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF ALTERNATIVES 
BUT WE'RE NOW MOVING AWAY FROM THE OLDER STYLE PROPERTIES TO THE MODERN EQUIVALENTS 
WITHIN A SIMILAR SORT OF PRICE RANGE 
I MEAN DOWLES CROFT AGAIN VERY CLOSE TO THE TOWN 
IT'S A THREE BED MODERN SEMI DETACHED PROPERTY 
THIS TIME NOT ONLY HAS OFF ROAD PARKING BUT A GARAGE AS WELL 
AMAZING VALUE FOR MONEY 
HEY YOU LOOK LIKE CHRIS EVANS 
OH CHEERS DOES EVERYONE SAY THAT THEY CALL HIM CHUCKIE 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT THOUGH NO 
JONATHAN YOU'RE PUSHING ME ABOVE MY BUDGET HERE DO YOU THINK THERE ARE DEALS TO BE MADE HERE 
WE'RE LEGALLY OBLIGED TO PUT ALL OFFERS FORWARD SO IF YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU LIKE 
PERHAPS IT'S WORTH PUSHING THE BUDGET A BIT FURTHER TO GET THE RIGHT PROPERTY 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SAID BUT IT WAS 
THIS IS TIM BOSWELL FOR TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY IN DROITWICH SPA 
NICE TO HAVE MET YOU THANKS 
YOU'VE PICKED A ROMANTIC SPOT HAVEN'T YOU THAT'S ME 
ARE WE GONNA HAVE A PICNIC LATER NO DID THE TOUGH GET GOING OR DID THE GOING GET TOUGH 
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID TO ME AH WELL NO 
THE TOUGH GOT GOING AND I CAME UP WITH A RESULT BECAUSE I FOUND THIS GREAT PROPERTY IN DROITWICH 
IT'S A NEW PROPERTY BUT IT'S GOT AN EN SUITE AND I THINK THAT'S JUST FANTASTIC 
I NEVER THOUGHT WE'D FIND ONE BUT I HAVE 
WOOOO I KNOW OFF ROAD PARKING 
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'VE CHOSEN THAT PLACE BECAUSE IN CONTRAST I'VE GOT THIS PLACE 
LIFE IS ONE BIG COMPROMISE AND IT'S ALL ABOUT TAKING A CHOICE ISN'T IT 
IT'S A VICTORIAN SEMI THEY ALWAYS HOLD A PREMIUM FOR PRICE 
SO OF COURSE I HAVEN'T GOT AN EN SUITE 
BUT SHE'S GOT A VICTORIAN HOUSE WITH BAGS OF CHARACTER OFF STREET PARKING BIT OF AN EXTENSION 
IS THAT THEIRS YEP AN EXTENSION DO YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS 
SHE'S GOT SIMILAR SORT OF SIZED PROPERTIES BUT OLD AND NEW AND VERY DIFFERENT 
YOU CAN TELL WHY WE'RE A TEAM BECAUSE WE WERE TOLD TO BE 
O. K. AND THE WILD CARD 
NOW THE WILD CARD IT'S BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT 
YEAH NICE DOOR GOOD SIGN THE BLUE DOOR 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT'S NOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH SHAKIN' STEVENS 
GOOD I AM VERY GLAD 
AND THERE'S SOMETHING DOWNSTAIRS IN THIS ONE AND I DON'T MEAN DOWNSTAIRS I MEAN DOWNSTAIRS 
IT'S A DOER UPPER WE CALL IT 
NOW THAT'S AN INTERESTING ONE TO GET THEM BECAUSE FOR A WILD CARD IT'S NOT WHAT THEY WANT 
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO A PLACE UP BUT IF IT'S CHARMING ENOUGH WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONVINCE THEM 
YOU'RE RIGHT KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS 
THE HORSES ARE IN THE STALLS AND IT'S TIME TO GO WITH PROPERTY ONE 
STRAIGHT OFF THE BLOCKS THEN IT'S MY CHOICE 
AN END TERRACE WHICH HAS BEEN EXTENDED WITH OFF ROAD PARKING 
WHICH IS RARE FOR AN OLD PROPERTY WHAT DO YOU THINK JENNY 
YEAH I QUITE LIKE IT BUT DOESN'T THAT FRONT DOOR OPEN STRAIGHT INTO THE LIVING ROOM 
BUT DON'T WORRY WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY 
O. K. MANDY AND KATIE HERE WE ARE AND THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS 
IT'S PROPERTY NUMBER ONE KATIE 
AND I'VE FOUND YOU A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE SEMI DETACHED VICTORIAN PROPERTY 
IT'S GOT TWO BEDROOMS SLASH THREE YOU COULD CALL ONE OF THEM A STUDY IF YOU LIKE 
I'VE GOT YOU OFF STREET PARKING WHAT MORE DOES A GIRL WANT 
IT'S FOUR MILES TO MUM'S WHICH IS ABOUT RIGHT BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT MUM THERE ALL THE TIME NO NO 
NOW YOU DID SAY THERE WERE A COUPLE OF DEFINITE NO NOS 
ONE OF THEM WAS YOU DIDN'T WANT THE DOOR TO OPEN ONTO THE LIVING ROOM 
CAN I JUST SAY THE DOOR DOES OPEN ONTO THE LIVING ROOM 
NO NO IT OPENS INTO THE DINING ROOM 
IT'S STILL A LIVING AREA SO THERE IS A SLIGHT LACK OF HALL OR PORCH 
MAYBE WE CAN SORT THOSE THINGS OUT 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS YOU TWO YEAH GREAT LOCATION 
I LIKE IT YEAH I LIKE THE PARKING SO FAR 
I LIKE THE WINDOWS YOU SAID YOU WANTED OFF STREET PARKING FOR TWO 
I'VE GOT YOU OFF STREET PARKING FOR ONE BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN PARK ON THE ROAD 
PROPERTY NUMBER ONE IS A VICTORIAN PROPERTY 
YOU ALWAYS PAY A PREMIUM FOR VICTORIAN PROPERTY SO THERE WILL BE OTHER COMPROMISES 
SEE WHAT YOU THINK THANK YOU 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN YEP I'D LOVE TO 
O. K. LET'S GO 
AND IN THE WORDS OF JOHN WAYNE AGAIN I FEEL A GOOD THING GOING WITH THIS PROPERTY 
I FEEL IT IN MY FINGERS I FEEL IT IN MY TOES 
WHERE WERE YOU IN THE EIGHTIES THAT WAS WET WET WET MUPPET 
NOW THERE ARE TWO THINGS THIS COULD BE 
IT COULD BE PROPERTY NUMBER TWO JENNY'S CHOICE 
OR IT COULD BE A LITTLE STABLE FOR A SHETLAND PONY 
IT'S NOT TOO BAD YOU CAN GET A TABLE IN 
IT'S CERTAINLY USEABLE AS A DINING ROOM 
YOU COULD ALSO SAY THAT THIS ROOM IS ACTUALLY A VERY BIG ENTRANCE HALL 
YOU COULD CERTAINLY PUT A PORCH ON THE FRONT THERE 
SO THERE MUST BE MORE THAN ONE ROOM TWO ROOMS DOWNSTAIRS THEN 
IT'S NICE GORGEOUS FIREPLACE 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ORIGINAL BUT IT'S VICTORIAN 
LET'S GO THROUGH HERE 
OH WOW 
I LOVE THE FLOOR 
NICE WORKABLE KITCHEN 
AND THE KITCHEN I THINK IS A MINIATURE VERSION OF MUM AND DAD'S 
LACKING A HUGE MARBLE SLAB IN THE MIDDLE YEAH 
SPACE FOR A DISHWASHER WOW 
MUM SOUNDS QUITE EAGER DOESN'T SHE 
QUITE SMALL YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE A SMALLISH SUITE 
VERY SMALL SUITE BUT I WANT AN L. SHAPED SOFA 
SHE WANTS AN L. SHAPED SOFA 
HAVE THEY FOUND THE DOWNSTAIRS TOILET WHAT 
AH SUNGLASSES 
I'M NOT SURE I'VE EVER HEARD OF A LOO OFF OF A SITTING ROOM BEFORE 
IT'S A BONUS YOU NEVER HAVE TO USE IT 
YOU'VE GOT A DOWNSTAIRS LOO IN A HOUSE THIS SIZE 
I THINK IT'S AN ENORMOUS BONUS 
I LIKE THE STAIRS GOING ROUND THEY'RE BENDY DOESN'T USE TOO MUCH SPACE UP 
I THOUGHT SHE SAY THEY'RE TOO STEEP AFTER SHE'S HAD A COUPLE WITH HER FRIENDS 
WOULD YOU GET A DOUBLE BED IN HERE YEAH 
I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD AT A PUSH 
VERY GOOD SIZED CUPBOARDS YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE WARDROBES

THAT'S BRILLIANT WELL YOU COULD EVEN HAVE A COMPUTER HERE

BUT WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE ON A CUL DE S. A. C. AND THERE'S A GOOD REASON 
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO WALK STRAIGHT INTO A LIVING ROOM OR DINING ROOM YOU'RE HAPPIER THAN I THOUGHT 
NO BUT CERTAINLY IF THERE'S A WAY ROUND IT I'LL TAKE IT 
THE REASON WE'RE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD IS BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO LOOK THIS WAY LADIES

PLENTY OF ROOM FOR A TABLE OBVIOUSLY 
YEAH YOU'D GET A GOOD SIX OR EIGHT SEATED HERE 
I LIKE ALL THESE FANCY LITTLE ARCHES

I THOUGHT SHE WOULDN'T LIKE THOSE VERY TYPICAL OF THE PERIOD YOU KNOW CIRCA NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE YEAH 
GLORY HOLE FANTASTIC 
YEAH KITCHEN 
WOW KITCHEN I LIKE SMALL BUT COMPACT 
SHE LIKES THE KITCHEN POKY BUT NICE MUM DOESN'T SOUND AS ENTHUSIASTIC 
I LOVE THE TILES YEAH NICE 
BLACK TILES YOU SEE 
VERY CHIC I THOUGHT SHE'D SAY BLACK TILES ARE FOR BOYS 
BUT NO SHE'S QUITE INTO THEM 
NICE LITTLE TOILET THESE PEOPLE HAVE TOILETS YEAH IT'S A NICE LITTLE TOILET 
OFF THE KITCHEN THAT'S WEIRD 
IT'S UNUSUAL BUT IT'S FINE 
AHA GARAGE CRIKEY OOH 
YOU COULD USE THAT GARAGE FOR A UTILITY ROOM 
JUST ABOUT GET YOUR MINI IN HERE 
BUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE MINI IN HERE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET ALL THE JUNK IN HERE 
IT'S A GOOD SPACE WITH CUPBOARDS AND WHATNOT YEP 
ONE CAR MIGHT GO IN THERE AND THE OTHER ONE OUTSIDE 
YEP SHALL WE GO UPSTAIRS 
THAT'S IT FOR THE DOWNSTAIRS THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN SAY ABOUT IT 
O. K. 
OH WE'VE GOT A BANISTER HERE 
THERE'S SOMETHING UPSTAIRS THAT IS GONNA DO IT FOR KATIE THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING 
IT'S CERTAINLY SWEET JENNY 
IS IT A THREE BED SO I THINK THIS IS THE SMALLEST PROBABLY IS NOT BAD 
NOT BAD IT'S MARVELLOUS 
YOU'D PROBABLY GET A SINGLE BED IN HERE ACTUALLY 
YEAH COURSE YOU WOULD SINGLE BED FOR SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO POP OVER FOR THE WEEKEND 
BATHROOM MORE BLACK TILES THEY DO LIKE THE DARK TILES HERE 
DARK TILES I DON'T THINK MUM LIKES THE DARK TILES KATIE'S LOVING THEM 
THERE'S A SHOWER THINGY BUT NO SHOWER RAIL AND THINGS 
MANDY'S TALKING HERSELF OUT OF THIS PROPERTY I CAN TELL SHE'S AH WELL MMMN YEAH MMMN 
IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST ROOM BUT NEITHER WAS THE ONE IN IAN'S CHOICE 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IAN'S CHOICE I LIKE THIS LANDING SPACE 
WAIT FOR THE MOMENT SHE GOES INTO THE MAIN BEDROOM AND SHE SEES WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER 
THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM WOW I LIKE THE COLOURS YEAH

I QUITE LIKE THIS SPACE HERE 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR WARDROBE SPACES QUITE DEEP 
THAT'S FAB ACTUALLY FOR ME WITH ALL MY CLOBBER 
AND I LIKE THE WARDROBES WITH THE MIRRORS YOU WALK THROUGH YOUR CLOTHES EITHER SIDE 
IT'S A NICE WINDOWSILL I COULD PUT ALL MY PHOTOS ON THERE AND I'VE GOT LOADS OF THOSE YOU CERTAINLY HAVE 
I THINK THEY LIKE IT CERTAINLY LIKE THE WINDOWSILLS 
THEY DO JENNY BUT JUST REMEMBER THIS SAYING 
THERE'S NO POINT IN CLOSING THE STABLE DOOR ONCE THE HORSE HAS BOLTED 
NOW LADIES WHAT DO WE REALLY HONESTLY AND TRULY THINK OF THIS PROPERTY 
BECAUSE I SENSE A HINT OF DOUBT ON PAPER IT'S VERY GOOD BUT 
MAYBE IF I GAVE YOU AN IDEA TO GIVE YOU A BIT MORE OF A SENSE OF SPACE WOULD THAT HELP 
POSSIBLY BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL AGREED ON THE FACT THAT THE KITCHEN IS QUITE SMALL 
IT FEELS QUITE CLAUSTROPHOBIC 
POINTY YES IT'S A FUNNY SHAPE 
IT'S NOT A VERY SOCIAL KITCHEN IS IT NO SO I WAS THINKING THE TREND IS TO HAVE A KITCHEN DINER NOW 
I MEAN YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT A FORMAL DINING AREA AT YOUR STAGE IN LIFE DO YOU 
NO SO HERE WE HAVE THIS LOVELY ARCH WHICH I KNOW YOU QUITE LIKE 
BUT WHAT ABOUT IF WE BLOCKED THIS UP HERE AND OPEN UP THIS WALL HERE YEAH 
AND THEN YOU COULD LEAD THE KITCHEN THROUGH TO A LOVELY DINING SPACE HERE 
SO YOU'VE GOT DOORS THAT WE CAN COME IN FROM THE LIVING AREA HERE 
STRAIGHT IN GOT A NICE KITCHEN DINER 
MUCH MORE SPACIOUS ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
I WOULD PUT SOME PATIO DOORS THERE IN THAT CASE 
IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT LOOK BIGGER THEN 
YEAH IT'S A GOOD IDEA IT'S DO ABLE IT DEPENDS ON THE PRICE 
EXACTLY THAT KITCHEN MIGHT BE SMALL BUT IT'S CLEAN IN THERE 
I LOVE HOW YOU COULD JUST WASH UP AND LOOK OUT OVER THE GARDEN 
THIS IS MY HAPPIEST TIME REALLY 
I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT BECAUSE I THINK MANDY YOU'RE ONE WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING AREN'T YOU 
YEAH I LIKE A GOOD RUBBER GLOVE 
THEY'RE NICE THESE ONES HAVE FLUFF INSIDE REALLY NICE 
OH GETTING WORRIED NOW IAN SHALL WE GUESS THE PRICE AGAIN 
O. K. SO LET'S REMIND OURSELVES OF THE BUDGET WHICH WAS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE OF COURSE YEAH 
YOU WENT FIRST LAST TIME 
MANDY YOU SHOULD GO FIRST THIS TIME 
AND REMEMBER KATIE YOU'VE GOT ONE UP AT THE MOMENT I HAVE GO FOR IT MANDY 
I'M GOING TO GO FOR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY O. K. 
SO KATIE OH THAT'S THROWN YOU HASN'T IT I THINK IT'S A LOT MORE 
I THINK IT'S MORE THAN THE LAST ONE BECAUSE IT'S A NEW BUILD 
YEAH YOU'VE GOT YOUR ENSUITE WITH WALK IN WARDROBE I'M GOING TO SAY ONE HUNDRED NINETY 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOUR GIRL MANDY 
IT'S WORTH IT EDUCATION YOU SEE IT IS 
SO MUCH DEBATE AT THE MOMENT BUT ALL THAT MONEY YOU'VE LENT HER 
YOU CAN TELL SHE'S COME STRAIGHT OUT OF UNIVERSITY BECAUSE THE ASKING PRICE FOR THIS IS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
LOOK AT THAT FIFTY SPONDUKES OUT 
I THINK IT'S TOO MUCH FOR THIS I DO 
O. K. I LIKE THAT BIT OF HONESTY WE SAID THAT ALL ALONG 
SHE'D BE A GOOD CHARTERED SURVEYOR WOULDN'T SHE 
WELL THINGS DON'T END THERE YOU KNOW 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION YET 
BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO WAIT FOR THE CHEEKY WILD CARD 
WHICH I HAVE TO SAY PEOPLE USUALLY LIKE DON'T THEY 
WILL KATIE AND MANDY ALSO FALL FOR THE WILD CARD 
I THINK THEY REALLY WILL HAVE TO USE THEIR IMAGINATION HERE IAN 
YES BUT WITH ORIGINAL FEATURES THROUGHOUT GOOD SIZED ROOMS AND THREE BEDROOMS 
IF THIS HOUSE WAS DONE UP IT WOULD BE A THOROUGHBRED I JUST HOPE KATIE HAS YOUR VISION IAN 
KATIE AND MANDY I THINK WE'VE SAVED YOU IN SOME WAYS THE BEST TILL LAST 
I THINK YOU KNOW WHY IT'S THE WILD CARD BECAUSE WE'RE NOT IN DROITWICH ARE WE 
NO NO WE'RE IN WONDERFUL WORCESTER AND WE ARE BOTH VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS HOUSE KATIE 
NOT JUST BECAUSE ACROSS THE ROAD YOU HAVE 
A FANTASTIC PARK A BABBLING BROOK TENNIS COURTS EVEN A LIDO OVER THERE 
BUT WE'VE FOUND WHAT WE THINK IS A GROWN UP VICTORIAN HOUSE WITH BAGS OF POTENTIAL 
AND EVEN MORE INTERESTINGLY NOT THAT THAT WASN'T 
YOU LIKE TWENTY NINE DON'T YOU DO YOU LIKE TWENTY FIVE I DO THAT IS MY LUCKY NUMBER 
HA HA MUSIC TO OUR EARS 
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY 
NEEDS A BIT OF T. L. C. BUT IT'S SPACIOUS 
IT'S AN INVESTMENT PROPERTY AS WELL IT IS 
AND IT DOES FEEL LIKE HOME YOU WALK IN AND IT FEELS LIKE HOME YEAH 
BUT YOU KNOW WE LIKE IT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT LOOKS NICE FROM THE OUTSIDE NO OFF ROAD PARKING 
NO BUT I COULD DEAL WITH THAT QUIET ROAD QUIET ROAD

THIS SIDE OF WORCESTER YES THIS IS THE RIGHT SIDE YEAH GOOD 
WELL TAKE YOURSELVES IN HAVE A LOOK ROUND AND WE'LL SEE YOU WHEN YOU COME BACK 
O. K. LET'S GO SEE YOU IN A WHILE THANK YOU 
WHAT'S YOUR LUCKY NUMBER I WAS GOING TO SAY WHAT'S YOURS REALLY 
YOUR AGE IS MY LUCKY NUMBER FORTY FIVE 
WOW WELL IAN I COULDN'T GET YOU THE ROYAL ENCLOSURE IN TIME SO I GOT YOU THE BACK GARDEN INSTEAD 
IT'S REALLY BIG 
IT'S KIND OF GRAND IN A POSH KINDA WAY 
OH IT'S GRAND IN A POSH KINDA WAY 
REALLY HIGH CEILINGS AGAIN 
NICE FLOOR 
IT'S NICE GOOD SIZE ACTUALLY ALL CREAKY AND OLD I LIKE IT 
I THINK KATIE LIKES HIGH CEILINGS WHAT D'YOU THINK 
WHAT'S THIS 
DINING ROOM WOW 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE AGAIN 
YOU'VE GOT TWO PROPER SIZED RECEPTION ROOMS IN THIS HOUSE 
OH MY GOODNESS IT'S A CELLAR IT IS A BIT OF A CELLAR 
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE OLD COAL CELLAR IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FULL HEIGHT 
I'M NOT GOING DOWN THERE CRIKEY 
SHE'S SOUNDS A BIT FREAKED OUT NOW YEAH 
WATCHING TOO MANY MOVIES I DO THAT SCARY ONES 
WHERE THERE'S A CELLAR OH NO I'LL GO DOWN THERE LATER 
RIGHT LOOK AT THAT LATER YEAH 
SMALL VERY SMALL YES YOU MIGHT HAVE A BIT OF A PROJECT HERE 
THIS KITCHEN IS SMALL IT'S OUT OF DATE OLD FASHIONED 
SLEDGEHAMMERS COME INTO MIND 
IN FACT YOU COULD PUT THE KITCHEN IN THERE COULDN'T YOU 
THIS IS THE FIRST PROPERTY WHERE WE REQUIRE THEM TO HAVE A BIT OF VISION 
AND SEE PAST WHAT'S THERE SEE WHAT COULD BE THERE 
THEY'RE QUITE STEEP AREN'T THEY 
UP THE STEEP STAIRS WHAT YOU GET IN AN OLD HOUSE ISN'T IT 
OOH PURPLE 
SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE ORANGE KITCHEN 
THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE UP HERE UNEXPECTED AS WELL 
I LOVE THE HIGH CEILINGS AGAIN YEAH 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT ALL THIS NO GOT TO GO 
NIGHTMARE TO REMOVE THE WHOLE HOUSE IS COVERED IN IT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT CHIP PAPER WOODCHIP 
GOOD VIEWS 
NICE LITTLE ROOM 
EVERY SINGLE HOUSE WE'VE SHOWN THEM INCLUDING THE MODERN ONE 
WAS VERY BRIGHT INSIDE AND SPACIOUS M. M. M. 
THE STUDY 
LOVELY GARDEN OH YEAH 
AND IT'S A SUNNY ASPECT AS WELL 
SUNNY ASPECT THESE TWO SHOULD BE ESTATE AGENTS 
I HOPE IT'S WELL UNDER BUDGET BECAUSE YOU'D NEED THIRTY THOUSAND TO SPEND IN HERE 
A PROPERTY LIKE THIS IS RIPE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND YOU CAN LIVE IN IT HAPPILY 
UNTIL YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT BIT BY BIT 
OOH BATHROOM 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE IT'S NICE THOUGH OH DEAR WHAT'S WITH THE CEILING 
IT'S GOT POTENTIAL BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE SPACE 
RIGHT THE BEDROOMS ARE NOT BIGGER THEN ARE THEY 
THIS IS THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER ONE SURELY 
WHEN YOU WALK INTO THESE BEDROOMS THEY SEEM THE SAME SIZE 
BUT THEY'RE MUCH BIGGER THAN THE PROPERTIES WE'VE SHOWN 
I SEE IT'S GOT POTENTIAL BUT OH DEAR 
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THE QUANDARY IS HERE WHAT DIY OR NOT TO DIY THAT'S THE QUESTION 
ENOUGH POETIC LICENCE COME ON GIDDY UP OOH 
SO KATIE IT'S FAIR TO SAY YOU LIKE THIS HOUSE 
I DO I LIKE IT A LOT 
AND A BIT LIKE ME YOU'RE QUITE EXCITED BY THE FACT THERE'S A CELLAR AND IT'S A GREAT CELLAR 
USUALLY ONLY BOYS LIKE CELLARS AND SHEDS YOU KNOW 
IS IT MAYBE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOU'RE A GIRL CHARTERED SURVEYOR 
COULD BE ARE YOU A RARE THING IT'S A MAN'S WORLD REALLY ISN'T IT IT IS A MAN'S WORLD YEAH 
I JUST STRUGGLE THROUGH IT 
WELL I'M SURE YOU'LL DO VERY WELL AT IT SO YOU LIKE THIS HOUSE DON'T YOU I DO YEAH 
YOU'RE ALSO AWARE THAT IT'S A BIT OF A PROJECT 
YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL BUT THERE'S ALSO A GOOD THIRTY THOUSAND TO SPEND 
AND THEN THE THIRTY THOUSAND WOULD GET YOU THERE AND THEN YOU'D NEED TO DO THE BASEMENT IF YOU WANTED TO ONE DAY 
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC AND IT'S A LOVELY FLOOR 
BUT IF PEOPLE DOWN HERE COULD SMELL IT IT'S DAMP ISN'T IT YEAH 
GOOD OLD SMELL OF DAMP SO THE FLOOR WOULD NEED TO COME UP 
WE'D NEED TO DIG DOWN TO GET A BIT MORE HEAD HEIGHT 
AND THEN THE CELLAR NEEDS TANKING AS WELL BIG PROJECT 
EVEN MORE MONEY YOU LOOK WORRIED YEAH IT WOULD HAVE TO BE QUITE BELOW THE BUDGET 
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT SO ANYWAY WE SHOULD GO UP AND FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT IS O. K. 
O. K. NOW MANDY I KNOW THAT YOU'RE A BIT APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THIS PROPERTY 
THERE'S A LOT TO DO AND WHAT ARE YOU THINKING 
I THINK SHE MIGHT BE BITING OFF MORE THAN SHE COULD CHEW 
SO YOU'RE A BIT MORE WARY ABOUT THIS ONE BECAUSE YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY 
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE ON ALL THE HARD WORK FAIR ENOUGH 
BUT AS A PROPERTY IT WOULD BE A GREAT INVESTMENT 
ABSOLUTELY IT'S GOT HUGE POTENTIAL NOT A BAD THING 
THE ONE THING I KNOW WE HAVEN'T GOT THAT SHE REQUIRED WAS OF COURSE OFF ROAD PARKING 
SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KNOCK DOWN THIS WALL HERE AND DROP THE KERB YEAH 
TO DO THAT THOUGH YOU HAVE TO GET CONSENT FROM THE COUNCIL 
YOU JUST CAN'T GO AND DO IT OBVIOUSLY 
AND WHOEVER DOES THE JOB HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THE COUNCIL AS WELL 
SO IT HAS TO BE A CONTRACTOR THAT IS APPROVED BY THEM YEAH 
AND OVERALL IT'S GOING TO COST ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED ALL IN SO NOT TOO BAD 
I THINK IT WOULD BE WELL WORTH IT 
IT'S ALL TALKING FIGURES TALKING CASH AS USUAL IT'S ALL DOWN TO THE BUDGET 
WE'RE BACK TO GUESS THE PRICE 
WE'VE BEEN IN THE CELLAR WE SLIGHTLY SMELL DAMP KATIE AND ME BUT IN A GOOD WAY 
I HOPE SO IF SMELLING DAMP IS A GOOD THING IS IT KATIE NOT REALLY NO 
ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT THIS ONE 
YEAH IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT YEAH HERE WE GO 
SO BUDGET ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND 
KATIE 
WELL THERE'S SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE I'M HOPING THAT IT'S GONNA COME IN BELOW BUDGET 
EVER THE OPTIMIST BUT I'M STILL GOING TO GO FOR MORE THAN I THINK AND SAY ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR O. K. 
MANDY 
I'M GOING TO GO LOWER AGAIN ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
WOW WELL 
IT'S INTERESTING THIS ONE BECAUSE I'M AFRAID YOU'RE BOTH VERY WRONG 
THE ASKING PRICE IS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE LOOKS OF HORROR DAH DAH DAH DAH 
JUST TAKE THAT IN NOT ON YOUR NELLY IS WHAT'S COMING TO MIND WITH ME I'M NOT SURE ABOUT ANYONE ELSE 
YOU ARE JER OKING YOU ARE JER OKING YEAH THAT'S A LITTLE PRICEY 
THERE'S AT LEAST THIRTY THOUSAND TO SPEND AND THAT WOULDN'T EVEN TOUCH IT 
I LOVE HER THOUGH SHE'S SO QUALIFIED TO LOOK AROUND THESE PROPERTIES 
IN FACT OUR TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY SURVEYOR I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE NEED HIM 
ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GETTING A CERTAIN VIBE FROM YOU 
IT'S A LOVELY HOUSE IT DOES NEED MONEY SPENDING ON IT IT'S A LONGTERM PROJECT 
BUT IT MIGHT JUST BE TOO MUCH YEAH 
ONCE YOU GET OVER THE SHOCK THOUGH YOU HAVE SEEN THREE PROPERTIES ALL VERY APPEALING IN THEIR OWN WAY 
YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHICH ONE YOU ARE GOING TO TEST DRIVE 
AND POSSIBLY PUR CHASE WHO KNOWS PUR CHASE I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS I AM AS WELL 
IT'S A FIRST HOME IT IS DON'T DECIDE NOW COS IT'S A BIG DECISION 
IT'S THE FIRST HOUSE GO AWAY DISCUSS IT YOU AND MUM WORK OUT WHICH ONE YOU'RE GOING TO TEST DRIVE 
WE'LL SEE YOU AT WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE 
O. K. THANK YOU 
WHILE OUR LOVELY LADIES MAKE A DECISION ON WHICH PROPERTY THEY ARE GOING TO TEST DRIVE 
HERE'S A REMINDER OF ALL THREE 
OUR RUNNERS AND RIDERS WILL KATIE OPT FOR PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
THE END TERRACE WITH OFF ROAD PARKING THREE BEDROOMS AND A DOWNSTAIRS LOO 
IN MY OPINION THIS IS THE ODDS ON FAVOURITE AND IT'S SPOT ON BUDGET AT 
NAH THIS IS WHERE YOU ARE WRONG IAN WHAT ABOUT PROPERTY NUMBER TWO IT'S GOT THE HALLWAY 
KATIE ASKED FOR THREE BEDROOMS ONE OF THEM ENSUITE A GARAGE AND LOOK AT THE DECOR 
ALL KATIE WOULD HAVE TO DO IS MOVE HER STUFF IN 
IT'S ONLY FOUR GRAND OVER BUDGET AT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
PERHAPS SHE'LL PUT ALL HER MONEY ON OUR WILD CARD A CHARMING MID TERRACE PROPERTY IN WORCESTER 
IT NEEDS A LITTLE T. L. C. BUT WITH ALL THOSE ORIGINAL FEATURES AND SPACE 
IT COULD BE THE PERFECT FIRST HOME FOR KATIE 
BUT WILL THE PRICE BE PERFECT AT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WELL KATIE AND MANDY LOOK AT THIS YOU'VE GONE FOR THE THOROUGHBRED 
BECAUSE MY HOUSE WAS FIRST PAST THE POST 
IT'S PROPERTY NUMBER ONE AND YOU'VE CHOSEN TO TEST DRIVE IT YES IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
WE HAD A FEELING YOU'D GO FOR THIS ONE 
WE THOUGHT WE'D THROWN YOU WITH THE WILD CARD BUT YOU STUCK TO YOUR GUNS 
WE THOUGHT WE'D THROWN YOU WITH THE WILD CARD BUT YOU STUCK TO YOUR GUNS 
AND OUR INITIAL INSTINCTS AND GONE FOR THIS ONE 
SO WELL DONE I HAVE TO HAND IT TO YOU IAN LOVELY PROPERTY 
OUR SURVEYOR HAS BEEN ROUND THIS PROPERTY BUT SOMETHING ELSE HAS HAPPENED 
YOU WENT ROUND WITH HIM DIDN'T YOU YEP I HAD A WALK ROUND WITH HIM 
THE FIRST THING IS THE ROOF THE ROOF TILES MAY NEED REPLACING 
BUT THERE'S A POSITIVE ON THIS SIDE 
THE TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY SURVEYOR TELLS ME 
THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A ROOM UP THERE AND CONVERT IT INTO A ROOM 
SO TWO BIRDS ONE STONE MIGHT AS WELL DO THAT TOGETHER O. K. 
AND THE OTHER THING IS THE DAMPCOURSE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN INJECTED 
SO WE'D NEED TO LOOK INTO THE CERTIFICATES AND SEE WHAT THE GUARANTEE SAYS ON THAT 
IS THAT LEGALLY BINDING OR SHOULD YOU GO ON AND GET YOUR OWN WHICH IS LEGALLY BINDING 
YES I'LL GET MY OWN WHICH IS LEGALLY BINDING 
YEAH IT'S A GOOD POINT WELL DONE YOU SHOULD DO THIS FOR A LIVING YEAH MAYBE YOU WILL ONE DAY 
VERY IMPRESSIVE WELL MISS KNOW IT ALL
