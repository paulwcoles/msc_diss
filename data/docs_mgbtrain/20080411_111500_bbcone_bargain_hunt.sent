WHEN THEY WERE MAKING THEM THEY WOULD REGISTER THE PRINT 
THESE LITTLE DOTS ARE USUALLY ONLY FOUND ON THE OLD GENUINE ONES I DIDN'T KNOW THAT 
THEY'RE NOT ON THE REPROS THE DEPTH OF THE COLOUR AND THE TYPES OF COLOURS IS VERY APPEALING 
AND JUST THE AGEING TO IT YES A FEW LITTLE CRACKS AND NICKS DOES THAT MATTER NO NO 
THERE AREN'T ANY SIGNIFICANT ONES THAT'S REALLY GOOD HOW MUCH DO THEY WANT IT SAYS THIRTY FIVE

HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A FARMER 
THERE'S A GUN HAVING A POT SHOT AND A LEOPARD SO POSSIBLY A FARMER IN AFRICA MAYBE 
WHAT'S ON THE BACK PEACE AND PLENTY AND HIS INITIALS 
IT'S A BIT BEATEN UP BUT IT'S A LOT OF MONEY EIGHTY FIVE

ALL RIGHT CHEESY GRIN GREAT 
ARCHIE PARTED WITH A WHOPPING SEVENTY FIVE 
HAVE THE TEAMS TAKEN THEIR EXPERTS' ADVICE DO PIPPA AND MICHAEL KNOW THEIR WINNERS FROM THEIR LOSERS 
THEY'LL HAVE TO PROVE IT WITH THE BONUS BUY WILL IT MAKE OR BREAK THE TEAM'S PROFIT 
PETER AND KENDA ARE OFF TO AUCTION WITH A ROYAL WORCESTER FIGURE 
FOR ONE HUNDRED THEY BOUGHT A CLARICE CLIFF CROCUS PATTERN BOWL THAT USED TO BE SOLD IN WOOLWORTH'S 
AND THE STAFFORDSHIRE GOBLET WAS BOUGHT FOR FORTY FIVE 
YOU DID WELL WITH THAT GOBLET STAND FIRM THAT'S THE IDEA 
NOW WHICH PIECE IS GOING TO BRING THE BIGGEST PROFIT CLARICE CLIFF 
SURE ABOUT THAT I THINK SO THEY BOUGHT IT TOGETHER 
AND HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND EH TWO HUNDRED FORTY 
SIXTY PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FIFTY SMACKERS TO MR. HOGBEN THANK YOU EXCITED MICHAEL VERY I LOVE SPENDING MONEY 
GOT ANYTHING IN MIND I'LL PHONE MY STOCKBROKER THE ONE AT THE BETTING SHOP 
SERIOUSLY GOING TO SPEND IT ALL THERE'S A FEW BITS OUT THERE 
DIFFICULT TO MAKE A PROFIT THAT'S THE PROBLEM I'M FACED WITH 
YOU'RE OUR NUMBER ONE MAN THANK YOU TIM 
ARCHIE AND JAN TAKE WITH THEM THE PRATT TOILET BOX AND COVER 
THE PEWTER ICE CREAM MOULD 
AND SEVENTY FIVE BOUGHT THEM THE OVAL COPPER SNUFF BOX 
COR THAT WAS A CLOSE SHAVE WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE PIECE 
I THINK IT'S THE LITTLE BOX 
SO HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO SO I WANT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT PLEASE 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT OF LEFTOVER LOLLY LOVELY JUBBLY 
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN GETTING ON GREAT FAIR HAVE YOU ANYTHING IN MIND FOR THE BONUS BUY 
I HAVE I'VE SEEN IT IT'S UNDERNEATH SOMETHING ELSE SO I'VE GOT TO RUSH OFF BIG PROFIT 
DEFINITELY TIM OFF YOU GO I FEEL A BIT OF A CASTLE COMING ON 
ACTUALLY I'VE NIPPED UP TO THE WELSH MARCHES TO TAKE A PEEK AROUND CHIRK CASTLE 
ANYONE NEED SOME NEW GARDEN GATES 
WHY NOT TRY THESE ON FOR SIZE 
THEY ARE MAGNIFICENT AREN'T THEY THEY STAND AT THE ENTRANCE TO CHIRK CASTLE IN CLWYD 
AND ARE THE ULTIMATE EXAMPLE OF HAND CRAFTED CRAFTSMANSHIP IN BOTH CAST AND WROUGHT IRON 
THEY WERE MADE BY TWO LOCAL CRAFTSMEN THE DAVIES BROTHERS 
BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWELVE AND ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETEEN 
ALL SORTS OF NOTABLES WILL HAVE PASSED THROUGH HERE THE KING OF SPAIN QUEEN MARY COLE PORTER 
HILAIRE BELLOC AND GEORGE GERSHWIN WHAT GORGEOUS PARTIES THEY MUST HAVE HAD 
RHAPSODY IN BLUE 
AND HERE ARE THE GATES IN THEIR ORIGINAL POSITION 
IN AN ENGRAVING DATED ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
NESTLING UNDERNEATH THESE NORMAN TOWERS THEY LOOK CURIOUSLY SMALL 
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST AMUSING VIEWS OF THE GATES AND THE CASTLE HAS TO BE THIS ONE 
BECAUSE IT'S SO WACKY BIZARRE 
THE LAYOUT OF THE VIEW IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE PRINT OVER THERE 
THAT WAS PRINTED IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
THIS WAS CREATED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND IT WAS DONE BY A CRAFTSPERSON WHO HAPPENED TO BE A SERVANT HERE IN THE CASTLE 
ROBERTS THE PORTER HE WOULD HAVE SAT DOWN AT THE END OF EVERY MEAL 
AND PERSUADED HIS FELLOW SERVANTS TO GIVE HIM ALL THE BONES 
HE CUT THOSE UP INTO SECTIONS AND INLAID THEM 
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE BLOCKS IS A SCRATCHED DESIGN TO CREATE THAT IMAGE BRILLIANT ISN'T IT 
THE TIMBER THAT IT'S INLAID INTO IS ALSO SPECIAL 
IT LOOKS LIKE EBONY AND IS CERTAINLY VERY DARK BUT IT'S BOG OAK 
AN OAK TREE THAT FELL DOWN ONE THOUSAND YEARS AGO INTO A WELSH BOG 
WAS SUBMERGED IN THE WATER AND THEN WENT BLACK OVER THE SUCCEEDING HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
THAT WAS DUG UP AND PRIZED AS A TIMBER AND THEN CREATED IN THIS INSTANCE 
INTO AN EXTRAORDINARY KNOBBLY FRAME 
IT'S A SERIOUS WORK OF ART A SERIOUS PIECE OF CRAFTSMANSHIP 
I WONDER WHETHER OUR TEAMS HAVE BEEN THAT CRAFTY AT THE AUCTION 
WE'RE OFF TO SHREWSBURY TO HALL'S AUCTIONS WITH JEREMY LAMOND 
HI JEREMY HI TIM LOVELY TO BE HERE THE ROYAL WORCESTER FIGURE 
PETER AND KENDA WENT FOR THIS 
THINK BIG FLY HIGH WELL THIS IS FREDA DOUGHTY 
THIS WAS HER FIRST MODEL 
ONE OF THE DIRECTORS OF ROYAL WORCESTER VISITED HER WHEN SHE WASN'T WORKING FOR THEM 
AND SAW HER MAKING THESE LITTLE MODELS AND HIRED HER 
REALLY NEVER DID A LIMITED EDITION BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LIMIT ACCESSIBILITY TO HER WORK 
THAT'S A PITY ISN'T IT THAT MEANS THERE'S LOTS ABOUT 
THIS IS THE MOST COMMON MODEL 
OH DEAR THE PARAKEET WORTH FORTY TO SIXTY 
NOT GOING TO TAKE OFF TO NINETY FIVE DOUBT IT WHAT DID THEY PAY NINETY FIVE 
OH DEAR NEVER MIND CLARICE CLIFF THE OLD CROCUS 
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HER IS SHE NEW LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT CLARICE 
NO THIS IS NOT A RARE BOWL 
NO IT'S HER MOST COMMON DESIGN CROCUS PATTERN 
SHE DID VARIATIONS ON A THEME OF CROCUS PATTERN NINETEEN THIRTIES BOWL SHAPED BOWL 
NOT GEOMETRIC FIFTY TO EIGHTY FIFTY TO EIGHTY THEY PAID ONE HUNDRED 
O. K. THAT'S A NORMAL RETAIL PRICE WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE PAID 
I'M NOT SEEING A BIG PROFIT THOUGH 
WHAT ABOUT THIS STAFFORDSHIRE COPPER LUSTRE GOBLET GOT HOPE ON IT YOU NEED HOPE TWENTY OR THIRTY 
IS THAT THE ESTIMATE YES DEAR OH DEAR FORTY FIVE THEY PAID 
RIGHT MONEY BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT IN YOUR OPINION 
MARK YOU FUNNY THINGS HAPPEN AT AUCTION HOPEFULLY THEY DO 
YOU NEED A LOT OF FUNNY THINGS HAPPENING FOR THEM TO DO WELL THREE 
BUT ANYWAY WE MIGHT GET SOME HOPE AND INSPIRATION OUT OF THE REDS' BONUS BUY LET'S LOOK AT IT 
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT FOR THE BONUS BUY YOU ONLY GAVE POOR MICHAEL SIXTY QUID TO PLAY WITH 
I'M QUITE HANDY WITH SIXTY QUID I CAME UP WITH SOME POOLE AEGEAN 
THAT'S NICE GOOD STUFF I LIKE IT 
I LIKE LATE SIXTIES EARLY SEVENTIES STUFF IT'S KICKING IN IN SALE ROOMS 
QUITE UNUSUAL AS AEGEAN IS BLUE 
A NICE PIECE NOT DAMAGED NO DAMAGE 
EXCELLENT STYLISED DECORATION 
THAT MAKES A CHANGE DON'T START ON ME HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY 
A MERE THIRTY WHAT'S THE PREDICTION OF PROFIT LOOKING AT THE SALE ROOM 
IT COULD BE BORDERLINE THIS ONE I'M NOT GUARANTEEING A PROFIT NO 
NO TO BE HONEST WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME I WENT LIKE THAT 
SO IT'S ON THE CUSP IT IS INDEED 
I'M CONFIDENT BUT I'M NOT SURE DOES IT HAVE ANY AGE TO IT NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT SEVENTIES ROUND THAT WAY 
QUITE A LOT OF AGE THEN FORTY YEARS THAT'S OLD FOR MICHAEL 
YOU DON'T NEED TO DECIDE UNTIL AFTER THE SALE OF YOUR THREE ITEMS 
NOW LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS 
THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT'S POOLE 
IT IS LINDA WILLS SHE'S THE DECORATOR 
SHE IS SIGNED ON THE BOTTOM TYPICAL EXAMPLE FROM THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
A RATHER SINUOUS ALMOST ART NOUVEAU DESIGN 
THAT SHOULD DO WELL TWENTY OR THIRTY

WE'LL GET IT AWAY FOR THEM MY CHILDREN WOULD SAY WICKED DAD THAT'S BAD NO AWFULLY GOOD 
IN MODERN PARLANCE SO THEY TELL ME 
NOW THE ICE CREAM MOULD A PRETTY USELESS THING ICE CREAM 
OR BLANCMANGE I WOULD THINK TWENTY OR THIRTY AS MUCH AS THAT 
COULD BE O. K. THEY PAID FIFTY FIVE SHOULD IT HAVE A BOTTOM 
ER YES IT SHOULD SO IT'S MISSING ITS BOTTOM 
GOOD OVAL COPPER SNUFF BOX SOMETHING NICE AND RUSTIC 
THAT'S IT PEACE AND PLENTY THERE WE ARE LOOK AT THAT 
AND IT'S GOT THE OWNER'S DETAILS ON G. FURZEY 
THERE'S A BIT OF A HUNT GOING ON WITH THE HARES AND BIZARRELY A LEOPARD HERE 
IT MIGHT BE SOUTH AFRICAN COULD BE NINETEENTH CENTURY FAIRLY RUSTIC 
IT'S SEEN A FEW SHOTGUN PELLETS BEEN USED IN HUNTING I THINK 
OR IN THE BOER WAR THE BOER WAR THIRTY FORTY AS MUCH AS THAT 
THEY PAID SEVENTY FIVE O. K. 
SEVENTY FIVE IS A WICKED AMOUNT OF MONEY NO A MONSTROUS AMOUNT TO PAY 
IT'S BAD IT'S REALLY BAD IT'S WICKED AND BAD 
WICKED AND BAD OH DEAR LET'S LOOK AT THE BLUES' BONUS BUY 
ARCH JAN YOU GAVE PIPPA ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT YES WE WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE SPENT YOUR CASH ON

SOMEWHERE TO PUT THE COMBS POSSIBLY NEEDLES FOR SEWING AND IT COST 
IT COST FIFTEEN 
AH SEE 
JAN'S PERKED UP A BIT NOW I WAS ALL READY TO SAY HMM YES 
BUT AT FIFTEEN IT'S LEATHER IT'S MADE OF LEATHER 
WITH THE ART NOUVEAU MOTIF ON THE FRONT WHICH IS VERY NICE TOOLED AND EMBOSSED 
A BIT OF WORK'S GONE INTO IT DO YOU THINK IT IS ART NOUVEAU I DO 
MAYBE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER STRAP DOWN THE CENTRE THERE 
OTHER THAN THAT GOOD CONDITION WHAT WERE THESE BITS FOR 
EM NEEDLES AND THREADS 
THEY'D HAVE HOLES IN I DON'T KNOW 
YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH HER LIPS NOW I'M GOING TO ASK WHAT'S THE PREDICTION OF PROFIT PIPPA DEELEY 
I PREDICT TIMOTHY THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AT LEAST TEN ON THIS ONE 
NEARLY DOUBLE YOUR MONEY IF NOT MORE THERE'S YOUR PREDICTION 
YOU CAN DECIDE AFTER THE SALE OF YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS 
BUT NOW LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS 
SO PIPPA DEELEY BOUGHT THIS RATHER FEMININE LITTLE CASE O. K. NOT SURE WHAT IT'S USED FOR 
NICELY EMBOSSED IT IS IT LOOKS LIKE PIGSKIN 
VERY WELL STITCHED HERE AND SOME LITTLE FOLDS HERE 
FOR WHAT PRESSED FLOWERS BILLETS DOUX SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SOMETHING YOU COULD POWDER UP ON 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S A GOOD THING TWENTY OR THIRTY WE THOUGHT 
FIFTEEN THEY PAID POTENTIAL PROFIT A BARGAIN DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT 
ANYWAY WE'LL FIND OUT AT THE AUCTION YES YES YES YES 
YES WHAT MYSTERIOUS ITEMS ARE COMING UP FOR SALE IN THE AUCTION 
SO WHAT IS THIS POT SOME SORT OF GLORIFIED TEAPOT 
IT'S GOT A TEAPOT TYPE HANDLE AND A SPOUT AND PERHAPS A MISSING COVER 
BUT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY FOR TEA 
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT INSCRIPTION IN LATIN ROSAR SICC WHAT DOES ROSAR SICC MEAN 
WELL ROSAR IS EXTRACT OF ROSED SYRUP 
THIS IS AN UNUSUAL OBJECT IT'S A WET DRUG JAR 
IF YOU WEREN'T FEELING VERY WELL ACTUALLY FOR ROSAR SICC YOU PROBABLY HAD A BIT OF SCURVY 
YOU'D GO TO THE LOCAL PHARMACIST IN AMSTERDAM AND HE'D HAVE ROWS OF THESE POTS ON HIS SHELVES 
AND HE'D SAY WHAT YOU WANT IS EXTRACT OF ROSE SYRUP 
BECAUSE ROSE SYRUP IS A WET DRUG IN OTHER WORDS A FLUID 
IT WOULD BE SCORED IN A JUG LIKE THAT AND THAT SPOUT WOULD SIMPLY BE USED 
TO POUR A TINY PORTION OF ROSAR SICC OUT WHICH YOU'D QUICKLY IMBIBE AND HOPEFULLY FEEL A BIT BETTER 
OR BE DEAD ONE THING OR THE OTHER 
THIS HAS A LITTLE MARK UNDERNEATH THAT STAR LIKE AN ASTERISK 
THAT'S THE WHITE STAR FACTORY IN HOLLAND 
AND THIS WAS PROBABLY MADE ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY TO ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY 
SO IT'S GOT SOME CONSIDERABLE AGE IT'S MADE OF TIN GLAZE 
WHICH MEANS IT'S A BODY OF EARTHENWARE WITH VERY THIN WHITE TIN GLAZE WHICH IS SHINY ON THE OUTSIDE 
BUT IT HAS LEAD GLAZE ON TOP TO MAKE IT HARD SHINY AND DURABLE 
WHAT WOULD SOMEBODY DO WITH THIS TODAY A LOT OF PEOPLE COLLECT THINGS ABOUT DRUGS AND MEDICINES 
THAT'S PROBABLY WHO THE END BUYER OF THIS THING WOULD BE 
IT'S ESTIMATED AT THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED 
IF YOU FEEL A BIT QUEASY ABOUT THAT YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT IT'S REALLY WORTH IN A MINUTE AT THE AUCTION 
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT I'M JUST SECOND HAND ROSE
