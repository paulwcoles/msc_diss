THE GREAT CATHEDRALS WERE THE WONDERS OF THE MEDIEVAL WORLD 
THE TALLEST BUILDINGS SINCE THE PYRAMIDS 
THE SHOWPIECES OF MEDIEVAL CHRISTIANITY 
THESE CRYSTAL PALACES WERE BUILT CENTURIES BEFORE MODERN ARCHITECTS 
DID THE SAME WITH GLASS AND STEEL 
YET THEY WERE BUILT AT A TIME WHEN MOST OF US LIVED IN WOODEN HOVELS 
AND WITH LITTLE MORE THAN HAMMERS AND CHISELS ROPES AND PULLEYS 
WHO WERE THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT THEM 
WHAT DROVE THEM AND JUST HOW WERE THEY ABLE 
TO BUILD WITH SUCH BOLD AMBITION 
THE GREAT CATHEDRALS EMBODIED THE HIGHEST ASPIRATION OF THE MEDIEVAL AGE 
TO REPRESENT HEAVEN ON EARTH 
THE MEDIEVAL CONSECRATION SERVICE MADE THIS CLEAR 
OH HOW AWE INSPIRING IS THIS PLACE 
IT IS NO LESS THAN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THE GATE OF HEAVEN 
FOR THE MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION 
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING IN EXISTENCE HAD SYMBOLIC VALUE 
JUST AS CREATION WAS A BOOK WRITTEN BY GOD 
SO WHAT MAN DID SHOULD BE AN IMAGE OF THAT DIVINE ORDER 
FOR MEDIEVAL THINKERS CATHEDRALS WERE RICH IN SPIRITUAL MEANING 
THE HEIGHT REPRESENTETH COURAGE THE LONG LENGTH OF THE NAVE LONG SUFFERING 
THE BREADTH IS CHRISTIAN CHARITY 
AS THE STONES OF THE WALL WOULD HAVE NO STABILITY WITHOUT MORTAR 
SO MAN CANNOT BE SET IN THE WALLS OF THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM WITHOUT LOVE 
WHICH THE HOLY SPIRIT BRINGS 
BUT THE MEDIEVAL ENGLISH CATHEDRALS THAT STAND TODAY 
WERE BORN NOT OF LOVE BUT WAR 
THE NORMAN CONQUEST OF ONE THOUSAND SIXTY SIX BROUGHT WITH IT AN ARCHITECTURAL REVOLUTION 
FROM THE OUTSET IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE NEW CATHEDRALS WERE NOT ONLY ABOUT THE POWER OF GOD 
THEY WERE ALSO ABOUT THE POWER OF THE INVADERS 
BY THE ONE THOUSAND NINETIES ALMOST EVERY MAJOR SETTLEMENT IN THE COUNTRY 
FROM DURHAM IN THE NORTH TO CANTERBURY IN THE SOUTH 
HAD BECOME A VAST BUILDING SITE 
WITH OVER FIFTEEN CATHEDRALS UNDER CONSTRUCTION 
HERE IN NORWICH THE NORMANS OBLITERATED THE ANCIENT MARKET PLACE HOUSES AND CHURCHES 
INSTEAD THEY BUILT A CASTLE AND A CATHEDRAL 
TWIN PILLARS OF THE INVADERS' MIGHT 
MANY OF THE NORMAN BISHOPS HAD BEEN CLOSE TO THE CONQUEROR 
NOW THEY WERE REWARDED WITH PRESTIGIOUS JOBS 
THE BISHOP OF NORWICH HERBERT DE LOSINGA PAID A SMALL FORTUNE FOR HIS TITLE 
AND HE WANTED HIS NEW CATHEDRAL TO REFLECT HIS NEW STATUS 
IT WAS HERE THAT BISHOP HERBERT BUILT HIMSELF A MIGHTY PALACE 
RIGHT NEXT TO THE CONSTRUCTION SITE 
FROM HERE HE COULD OVERSEE BUILDING WORKS ON THIS ENORMOUS PROJECT 
THE BUILDING OF A CATHEDRAL IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY 
WAS A COLOSSAL UNDERTAKING 
ALL AROUND ME HERE WOULD'VE BEEN PERHAPS A COUPLE OF HUNDRED PEOPLE 
WORKING IN WHAT WOULD'VE LOOKED LIKE A SMALL TOWN 
THE NOISE AND DUST MUST HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY 
THE SMOKE AND SPARKS OF A BLACKSMITH'S FORGE 
THE BUZZ AND RASP OF CARPENTERS' SAWS 
STONE DUST THICK IN THE AIR AS THE MASONS CUT AND CARVED AND POLISHED 
AND PEOPLE SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER IN FRENCH ENGLISH EVEN LATIN 
THE DIN MUST HAVE BEEN DEAFENING 
STAGE ONE WAS TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS 
WE'RE ACTUALLY UNDER THE EAST END OF NORWICH CATHEDRAL 
THIS IS WHERE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CHURCH ITSELF STARTED 
FIRSTLY THEY WOULD HAVE TO DIG FOUNDATION TRENCHES WITHIN WHICH 
THEY WOULD PUT THE LOCAL STONE AND THE LOCAL STONE IN NORFOLK IS FLINT 
BECAUSE THEY'RE USING SMALL FLINTS THEY WOULD USE VERY LARGE QUANTITIES OF BURNT LIME 
THERE'S A LOT OF CHALK IN NORFOLK THEY CAN BURN THE CHALK TO MAKE LIME 
AND MIXING IT WITH WATER AND SAND TO CREATE A MORTAR TO HOLD THE WHOLE WALL TOGETHER 
TO GET IT AS TRUE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THEY'RE BUILDING IN FLINT 
THEY'D BE BUILT BETWEEN SHUTTERS WOODEN PANELS IF YOU LIKE 
WHICH WOULD BE PUT IN AT A HEIGHT OF ABOUT A THIRD OF A METRE 
YOU CAN SEE THAT SURVIVING IN THE WALLS 
BECAUSE THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE WALLS PARTICULARLY HERE 
CAN ONLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT THE PANELLING THE SHUTTERING 
WAS THERE AS PART OF THAT CONSTRUCTION PROCESS 
BUILDING USUALLY STARTED AT THE EAST END WHERE MASS WAS CELEBRATED 
WHEN THAT WAS FINISHED THE CHURCH COULD BE CONSECRATED AND PUT TO USE 
FOLLOWED BY THE TRANSEPTS RUNNING NORTH TO SOUTH 
THE NAVE AND THE SIDE AISLES WOULD FOLLOW 
FROM FOUNDATIONS TO FINISH MIGHT TAKE LESS THAN SIXTY YEARS 
OR AS MANY AS TWO HUNDRED IF THE MONEY RAN OUT 
IT'S A BIT OF A MYTH THAT THE MEDIEVAL CATHEDRALS 
SOMEHOW DESIGN THEMSELVES IN A GREAT COMMUNAL OUTBURST 
OF RELIGIOUS ENERGY WITHOUT THE HELP OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL AN ARCHITECT 
IN FACT HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN CALLED AN ARCHITECT BUT TO CREATE A STRUCTURE 
OF THIS AMBITION YOU NEEDED A MAN WITH SKILL VISION AND EXPERTISE 
A MAN WHO KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING 
THOSE MEN WERE CALLED MASTER MASONS 
THEY LEARNED EVERYTHING THEY KNEW ON SITE PROGRESSING FROM APPRENTICE TO STONE CARVER 
THEY TRAVELLED AND MADE SKETCHES OF WHAT THEY SAW 
ADAPTING THEM FOR THEIR OWN DESIGNS TO PUT TO THE BISHOP 
VERY FEW MEDIEVAL MASONS' PLANS OR NOTEBOOKS SURVIVE 
THOSE THAT DO SHOW THEY KNEW GEOMETRY 
NOT THE THEORY THAT WE UNDERSTAND TODAY BUT A GEOMETRY BASED ON THE COMPLEX MANIPULATION OF SQUARES 
CIRCLES AND TRIANGLES TO PRODUCE SHAPES AND PATTERNS 
IN REGULAR PROPORTIONS 
SOME OF THESE PATTERNS CAN SEEM PRETTY SOPHISTICATED 
THE RATIO OF ONE TO THE SQUARE ROOT OF TWO FOR EXAMPLE 
CROPS UP IN LOTS OF CATHEDRALS 
IT'S A FORMULA THAT SUGGESTS SOME PRETTY SOPHISTICATED MATHEMATICS 
IN FACT IT'S VERY EASY TO GENERATE USING SOME BASIC GEOMETRY 
SIMPLY DRAW A SQUARE 
AND THEN DRAW A DIAGONAL ACROSS IT 
AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DIAGONAL AND THE SIDE OF THE SQUARE 
WILL BE IN THE PROPORTION OF ONE TO THE SQUARE ROOT OF TWO 
SO IF YOU TAKE THE GROUND PLAN OR FOOTPRINT OF A CATHEDRAL 
LIKE NORWICH FOR EXAMPLE 
THE CLOISTER IS A SQUARE DRAW A DIAGONAL ACROSS IT 
AND YOU GET THE LENGTH OF THE NAVE 
CREATE A SQUARE FROM THAT LENGTH 
AND A DIAGONAL ACROSS THAT SQUARE 
GIVES YOU THE LENGTH OF THE ENTIRE CHURCH 
RIGHT UP TO THE HIGH ALTAR 
PROPORTION RATIO SYMMETRY 
TO THE MEDIEVAL MIND THESE WERE SPIRITUAL QUALITIES 
THEY REFLECTED THE HARMONY OF CREATION AND MEDIEVAL MASONS CARED PASSIONATELY ABOUT THEM 
SOME HAVE CLAIMED TO SPOT MYSTERIOUS MESSAGES AND CODES 
IN THE DIMENSIONS OF MEDIEVAL CATHEDRALS 
THE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR FOR EXAMPLE WHICH REFERS TO THE NUMBER 
OF THOSE WHO WILL BE SAVED IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION 
ALL KINDS OF NUMBERS THAT OCCUR IN THE BIBLE POP UP FROM TIME TO TIME 
IN CATHEDRAL ARCHITECTURE THESE ARE MOSTLY THE IDEAS OF CHURCHMEN 
MUCH MORE COMMON ARE THE BASIC GEOMETRICAL PRINCIPLES 
FOLLOWED BY THE MASTER MASONS 
WITH A SQUARE AND A CIRCLE AND A DIAGONAL YOU CAN GENERATE 
AN ENTIRE CATHEDRAL 
BUT HOW MUCH HARD SCIENCE DID THE ARCHITECT KNOW 
THE KNOWLEDGE OF MATHEMATICS PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED TODAY 
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE A BUILDING LIKE THIS STAND UP OR FALL DOWN 
THE MASTER MASONS REALLY UNDERSTOOD STABILITY CENTRE OF GRAVITY 
AND WHERE THAT CENTRE OF GRAVITY 
WOULD BE IN THEIR PILES OF STONES THAT EVENTUALLY MAKE A CATHEDRAL 
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE CONCEPT OF STRESS 
THAT IS A MODERN CONCEPT 
IT'S THE INTENSITY OF LOAD IT'S HOW MUCH LOAD PER UNIT OF AREA 
AND IN A CATHEDRAL LIKE THIS 
THAT INTENSITY OF FORCE IS REALLY COMPARATIVELY LOW 
IT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TONS ON EVERY SQUARE METRE 
SO IF YOU THINK OF THESE COLUMNS AS ONE SQUARE METRE BY ONE SQUARE METRE THEY COULD EASILY CARRY ONE HUNDRED TONS 
INDEED THEY COULD CARRY ONE THOUSAND TONS 
THOSE COLUMNS IN THE NAVE ARE HUGE AND THEY ARE THE WEIGHTIEST PART OF THE CATHEDRAL 
INDEED WHEN I WORKED OUT THE WEIGHT OF ONE BAY OF NORWICH CATHEDRAL 
THE TOTAL WEIGHT WAS ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TONS FOR ONE BAY 
OF WHICH ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TONS WAS IN THE COLUMNS 
SO YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WEIGHT WENT INTO THE COLUMNS AND THE WALLS 
VERY LITTLE WAS IN THE STONE VAULT AT THE TOP 
ONLY ABOUT THREE PER CENT OF THAT WEIGHT I FOUND IN THE THIN STONE VAULT 
AND THIS IS THE SECRET TO SUCCESS 
KEEPING THE WEIGHT LIGHT AT THE TOP HEAVY AT THE BOTTOM 
TO BRING THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY DOWN TO A LOWER LEVEL 
AND THEN THERE'S A STABILITY ELEMENT 
THIS ARCH ALLOWS THESE TWO COLUMNS TO WORK TOGETHER TO FORM A STABLE WHOLE 
LIKE STANDING ON TWO LEGS INSTEAD OF STANDING ON ONE 
YOU CAN REPEAT THE EXERCISE BY PUTTING MORE WEIGHT ON THE OUTSIDE THAN ON THE INSIDE 
THIS MAKES THIS EXTREMELY STEADY AND STRONG 
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO DEVISE A SET OF RULES 
BY WHICH THE STONEMASONS WOULD HAVE WORKED 
FOR EXAMPLE THE SLENDERNESS RATIO OF A COLUMN 
THAT IS THE HEIGHT OF THE COLUMN DIVIDED BY ITS WIDTH 
FOR MOST COLUMNS IF YOU KEEP THAT BELOW TEN THAT'S FINE 
AGAIN THE ARCHES AND THE VAULTS WERE PROPORTIONED WITH THE SET OF RULES 
THE THICKNESS OF A VAULT IS ROUGHLY ONE TWENTY T. H. OF ITS SPAN 
HERE AT NORWICH WITH A SPAN OF TEN M. THE VAULT IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED M. M. THICK 
AND THAT WORKS FINE 
SO THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE RULES THAT THE STONEMASONS 
WOULD'VE PASSED ON THROUGH THE FAMILY LINE OF FATHER TO SON 
WORSHIPPING IN CHURCHES BUILT PARTLY BY RULE OF THUMB 
WASN'T WITHOUT THE ODD ANXIETY 
THE CONGREGATION OF BEVERLEY MINSTER IN YORKSHIRE AROUND ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN 
GREW UNEASY AT THE NEW BUILDING WORKS IN THEIR GREAT CHURCH 
THE CRAFTSMEN WHO WERE IN CHARGE OF THE WORK WERE CONCERNED WITH BEAUTY RATHER THAN STRENGTH 
THEY LED THE NEW WORK INTO THE OLD INGENIOUSLY BUT NOT FIRMLY 
IN THE MANNER OF THOSE WHO SEW NEW CLOTH INTO OLD 
AT LAST IT CAME ABOUT THAT FROM FEAR A GREAT PART OF THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE REFUSED TO ENTER THE CHURCH 
AND THERE WERE OCCASIONAL DISASTERS 
THE CENTRAL TOWER AT WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL FELL IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVEN 
ONE OF THE WEST TOWERS AT GLOUCESTER COLLAPSED IN THE LATER TWELFTH CENTURY 
AT NORWICH THE SPIRE BLEW DOWN IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO 
MANY PROBLEMS CAME FROM POOR FOUNDATIONS 
WHICH CAUSED THE STONES TO SLOWLY SHIFT AND CRACK 
MOST PEOPLE NOW THINK THAT THE CATHEDRALS WERE ACTUALLY HEAVILY OVER ENGINEERED 
YOU COULD TAKE QUITE A LOT OF STONEWORK AWAY FROM THESE BUILDINGS WITHOUT THEM FALLING DOWN 
IN AN UPSTAIRS ROOM AT YORK MINSTER YOU CAN GET A TANTALISING FEEL 
OF THE EARLY STAGES OF A MASTER MASON'S WORK 
THIS IS A VERY VERY SPECIAL PLACE 
THESE ARE THE LIVING QUARTERS AND THE WORKSHOP OF ONE OF THE TOP MASTER MASONS IN THE COUNTRY 
THE MAN WHO DESIGNED YORK MINSTER 
HERE HE MIGHT HAVE COME UP WITH SOME OF HIS BEST DESIGN IDEAS PERHAPS 
SITTING ON HIS PRIVATE TOILET WHICH STILL EXISTS OVER THERE 
IT IS NOT JUST A PLACE FOR THINKING SLEEPING AND EATING 
HERE IS HIS DRAWING BOARD 
HIS DRAWING BOARD IS THE FLOOR AND SCRIBED ON IT 
ARE THE INDIVIDUAL LINES INDIVIDUAL PIECES OF STONE 
ALL AROUND US ARE SIMILAR PATTERNS WHICH OVER THE YEARS MIGHT HAVE BECOME QUITE A HEADACHE TO WORK WITH 
SO EVERY NOW AND AGAIN HE HAD TO PUT DOWN A NEW LAYER OF PLASTER 
AND TO MAKE IT REALLY FIRM PERHAPS DOZENS OF PEOPLE 
PERHAPS SOME OF THEM CHILDREN WOULD HAVE COME UP HERE AND WALKED AROUND IN SOCKED FEET AND WE CAN STILL SEE 
THE HEELS OF MEDIEVAL MASONS ON THIS FLOOR IT TO THIS DAY 
MAKING SURE IT'S AS FIRM AS POSSIBLE FOR THE NEXT SERIES OF DESIGNS TO BE WORKED IN 
THERE'S A FEEL OF THE MARY CELESTE ABOUT THESE MARKS 
AS IF THE MASTER MASON HAD JUST GONE OFF FOR LUNCH 
AND THE WINDOWS BUILT FROM THIS DESIGN ARE STILL THERE 
JUST A FEW FEET AWAY AT THE EAST END OF THE MINSTER 
THE NEXT TASK FOR THE MASTER MASON WAS TO CHOOSE THE STONE 
UP TO EIGHTY THOUSAND TONS OF IT 
DRAGGED TO THE SITE BY OX AND CART OR FLOATED DOWN RIVER ON BARGES FROM THE QUARRIES 
THIS QUARRY SUPPLIED STONE FOR LINCOLN CATHEDRAL 
IT WAS A MATTER OF BARS WEDGES HORSES CARTS 
QUITE A LABOUR INTENSIVE PROCESS 
THEY'RE NATURALLY BEDDED YOU CAN JUST SEE ONE GOING THROUGH THERE I SEE THAT FLAT LINE 
AND THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ONE DOWN HERE AND DOWN HERE SO YOU'VE GOT THREE DIFFERENT BEDS 
THEY KNEW THAT MEDIEVAL MASONS KNEW THE BEST STONE THE BEST STONE 
WAS THE SILVER BED WHICH WAS THE TOP ONE 
THE SILVER BED WAS TOP QUALITY CARVING FOR YOUR CARVINGS YOUR CAPS ANGELS GROTESQUES 
THE NEXT ONE WAS THE LOWER SILVER WHICH WAS STILL NICE TO WORK BUT 
A LITTLE BIT SOFTER AND THEN THE RED BED 
THEY ALL HAD THEIR INDIVIDUAL USAGE 
THESE ARE GOING TO END UP AS BEAUTIFUL CARVINGS 
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME PRETTY STRICT QUALITY CONTROL I IMAGINE 
YOU HAVE EVEN FROM THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF QUARRYING THE BLOCK 
IF YOU SEE QUITE A FEW NATURAL CRACKS IN THAT IT IS PUT TO A WASTE PILE 
THE QUARRYMEN WERE QUITE GOOD AT THEIR JOB 
BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T GO TO THE TROUBLE OF GETTING IT OUT IF IT WASN'T ANY GOOD ANYWAY 
THE FINAL SAY WAS THE MASTER MASON 
IT WAS HARD LABOUR AND ESPECIALLY ALL THAT WORK YOU WENT INTO TO GET THEM BLOCKS OUT 
THEN REALISE IT HAD A CRACK IN IT IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO FRUSTRATING 
SO I DO TAKE MY HAT OFF TO THEM 
THE MASTER MASON THEN HIRED A TEAM OF STONEMASONS 
TO WORK THE ROUGHLY CUT BLOCKS 
THEY FOLLOWED TEMPLATES MADE FROM HIS DESIGNS 
THE TEMPLATES APPLIED TO THE OUTSIDE OF A BLOCK OF STONE 
THEY GUIDE THE MASONS 
SHOW THE MASONS WHAT SHAPE THE STONE SHOULD BE 
IF THEY FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE TEMPLATES 
AND THEY FOLLOW THE SHAPE OF IT 
THEY WILL END UP WITH A BLOCK THAT'S CUT TO THE CORRECT SIZE 
YOU MAY NEED SEVERAL TEMPLATES FOR ONE STONE DEPENDING ON ITS COMPLEXITY 
IF IT'S A VERY COMPLEX PIECE OF TRACERY FOR INSTANCE OR A SPRINGING STONE YOU WOULD 
NEED A SECTION MOULD WHICH WOULD GO ON THE SIDE TO GIVE YOU THE PROFILE 
A BED MOULD THAT WOULD GO TO THE TOP 
AND APPLY TO THE BOTTOM PROBABLY TWO DIFFERENT MOULDS FOR THAT 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A FACE MOULD WHICH WOULD SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE STONE WHEN VIEWED FROM THE FRONT 
AND ANY LINES OF MOULDING THAT ARE ON THERE 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE DRESSMAKING IT'S THE SAME PRINCIPLE 
SO THIS IS THE FINAL DESTINATION OF A PIECE OF STONE 
YES THIS ONE HAS COME FROM THE QUARRY IT'S BEEN WORKED 
WE'VE CUT A SPACE FOR IT TO GO IN HERE 
WE'LL JUST PUT A LITTLE BED OF MORTAR ON HERE 
THIS IS JUST A MIXTURE OF SAND AND LIME 
MEDIEVAL BUILDERS USED A LIME MORTAR WHICH SETS LESS RIGIDLY THAN MODERN CEMENT 
SO THE STONES COULD SHIFT AND SETTLE OVER CENTURIES 
HERE I'VE GOT LEWIS PINS 
WHICH ARE VERY SIMILAR TO ONES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED IN MEDIEVAL TIMES I PUT THOSE IN THE HOLE 
AS I PULL ON THEM THEY'LL OPEN UP LIKE SO AND THEY'LL GRAB HOLD OF THE STONE FOR US 
YES WE CAN GET IT INTO THE EDGE AND THE STONE BELOW 
LOOKS LIKE IT'S FROM SOME PREVIOUS RESTORATION BUT THE ONE ABOVE 
HAS BEEN THERE FOR PROBABLY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED YEARS 
SOMEBODY PRESUMABLY HAS HAD TO COME UP HERE AND DO A VERY DETAILED MEASUREMENT OF THAT 
AND CREATE A TEMPLATE AND SOMEBODY DOWN THE MASON'S YARD 
HAS USED THAT TEMPLATE TO COME UP WITH THIS LOVELY CLEAN SMOOTH BIT OF MOULDING HERE 
IN CATHEDRAL BUILDING ANCIENT CRAFT MET MODERN ASSEMBLY LINE 
EACH STONE INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED AND CARVED THEN REPEATED 
TO CREATE SYMMETRY AND PATTERN 
AT DURHAM THE MASTER MASON PRESCRIBED 
THE PRECISE SIZE AND QUANTITY OF BLOCKS HE WOULD NEED TO BUILD THE CHURCH 
THE GREAT ZIG ZAG AND DIAMOND PATTERNS ON THE COLUMNS WERE CREATED 
FROM FIVE STANDARDISED DESIGNS 
EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY BLOCKS OF ONE SIZE SIX HUNDRED OF ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY OF A THIRD AND SO ON 
BY ARRANGING THESE IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
ALL THE PATTERNS ON THE COLUMNS CAN BE GENERATED 
IT'S AS IF THE CHURCH WAS A VAST JIGSAW 
THE BUILDING OF THE CATHEDRAL TESTED THE SKILLS AND INGENUITY OF THE CATHEDRAL BUILDERS TO THE LIMIT 
YET THE IDEAS AND METHODS THAT THEY USED HAD BARELY CHANGED SINCE ROMAN TIMES 
IN FACT THE STYLE THEY BUILT IN 
IN THE EARLY PERIOD IS CALLED ROMANESQUE 
IT'S BASED ON THE KIND OF ARCH THAT ROMANS USED THE ROUND ARCH 
THE SHAPE WAS ALWAYS BASED ON A CIRCLE 
OFTEN A FULL SEMI CIRCLE 
SOMETIMES A SECTION OF ONE OR WITH THE CURVE SLIGHTLY DISTORTED 
IT WAS SIMPLE BUT LIMITED 
ARCHES IN THE STYLE KNOWN AS ROMANESQUE CAN BE STURDY EVEN CHUNKY 
A WHOLE BUILDING MADE OF THESE ARCHES HAS A MUSCULAR POWERFUL EFFECT 
BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY CAME AN IDEA THAT WOULD CHANGE ALL THIS 
A REVOLUTION IN DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION 
WHICH WOULD RAISE CATHEDRAL BUILDING TO NEW LEVELS OF SOPHISTICATION 
IT WAS A STYLE THAT WOULD BECOME KNOWN AS GOTHIC 
IT WAS BORN IN FRANCE AT SAINT DENIS NEAR PARIS 
HERE THE VISIONARY ABBOT SUGER REBUILT PART OF THE ABBEY CHURCH 
BURIAL PLACE OF THE FRENCH KINGS 
HE WAS USING A NEW KIND OF ARCH 
NOT A ROUND ARCH BUT A POINTED ONE 
BUT HIS AIMS WENT BEYOND THIS 
FOR ABBOT SUGER HAD A VISION 
HE WASN'T SIMPLY AFTER SOMETHING BIGGER AND GRANDER 
HE HAD A THEOLOGICAL RATIONALE FOR HIS NEW DESIGN 
IT WAS A THEOLOGY OF LIGHT 
FOR MEDIEVAL THINKERS LIGHT HAD A PROFOUNDLY RELIGIOUS MEANING 
THE EMBODIMENT OF SPIRIT ONE WRITER CALLED IT 
THE WORK SHOULD BRIGHTEN OUR MINDS 
SO THEY TRAVEL THROUGH THE LIGHT TO THE TRUE LIGHT OF CHRIST 
IN SEEING THIS LIGHT THE DULL MIND IS RESURRECTED FROM DARKNESS 
ABBOT SUGER AND HIS UNNAMED MASTER MASON 
HAD GLIMPSED THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE POINTED ARCH 
IT'S BOTH STRONGER AND MORE FLEXIBLE THAN A ROUND ONE 
BOTH THE SHAPE AND WIDTH OF A POINTED ARCH CAN BE VARIED IN MORE WAYS 
AND THE WEIGHT OF A BUILDING NATURALLY MOVES DOWNWARDS 
AND OUTWARDS IN A SHALLOW CURVE 
CLOSER TO THAT OF A POINTED THAN A ROUND ARCH 
THIS SIMPLE DIFFERENCE WAS TO CHANGE 
THE ENTIRE WAY CATHEDRALS WERE CONCEIVED DESIGNED AND BUILT 
THE SECOND SUNDAY IN JUNE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR 
MAY HAVE HAD A GREATER EFFECT ON ARCHITECTURE THAN ANY OTHER DAY IN HISTORY 
AT THE DEDICATION SERVICE BISHOPS FROM ALL OVER EUROPE GATHERED AT SAINT DENIS 
TO WITNESS A BUILDING DESIGNED TO EVOKE THE EXPERIENCE OF HEAVEN 
MORE COMPLETELY THAN ANYTHING BEFORE IT 
THE BISHOPS WERE AWESTRUCK 
THEY HAD SEEN THE FUTURE 
THERE WAS ONE DISSENTING VOICE THE MONK BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX 
SAW IN SUCH SPLENDOUR NOTHING BUT WORLDLY DISTRACTION 
OH VANITY OF VANITIES BUT MORE FOLLY THAN VANITY 
EVERY PART OF THE CHURCH SHINES BUT THE POOR MAN IS HUNGRY 
THE WALLS ARE CLOTHED IN IN GOLD WHILE THE CHILDREN OF THE CHURCH REMAINED NAKED 
BUT SUCH ASCETICISM WAS OUT OF STEP WITH WHAT THE MIGHTY BISHOPS WANTED 
ENGLAND WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY OUTSIDE FRANCE TO TAKE UP THE NEW STYLE 
LORDS AND BISHOPS HAD ESTATES IN FRANCE AND FRENCH WAS THE LANGUAGE OF COURT 
WHEN FIRE DEVASTATED THE EAST END OF CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL THE MOST IMPORTANT CHURCH IN THE COUNTRY 
THE MONKS HERE SAW THEIR CHANCE 
THE MAN IN THE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTIES CHOSEN TO BE THE NEW MASTER MASON 
WAS SIGNIFICANTLY A MAN WHO HAD WORKED FOR YEARS IN FRANCE 
HIS NAME WAS WILLIAM OF SENS 
HIS TASK TO CREATE ONE OF ENGLAND'S FIRST GOTHIC CATHEDRALS 
THE GOTHIC STYLE STARTED A PUSH TO BUILD HIGHER 
IT WOULD PLACE NEW DEMANDS ON THE UNSUNG HEROES OF CATHEDRAL BUILDING 
THE CARPENTERS 
THEY BUILT SCAFFOLDING AND THE TIMBER FRAMES 
AROUND WHICH ENTIRE SECTIONS OF THE CATHEDRAL WERE BUILT 
INCLUDING THE ARCHES THEMSELVES 
WE START OFF WITH A WOODEN CENTRING 
WHICH WE PUT IN HERE 
THEN WE JUST START OFF DOWN THE BOTTOM OF THE ARCH 
BUILDING THE STONES UP EITHER SIDE 
THEY'RE BUILT ON LITTLE PADS 
WHICH SPACE IT OUT NICELY TO GIVE IT A NICE JOINT 
AND THEN ONCE YOU'VE GOT TO THE TOP YOU PUT IN THE KEYSTONES 
AND THEY'LL WEDGE IT ALL INTO PLACE SO THAT IT WON'T MOVE 
AFTER THAT WE POUR LEAD INTO Y. SHAPED GROOVES THAT RUN DOWN 
IN BETWEEN EACH OF THE STONES THAT MAKES IT EVEN MORE SOLID 
THEN WE FINISH OFF BY PUTTING MORTAR INTO THE JOINTS POINTING IT UP 
SO PUTTING UP THIS WALL IS THE FINAL STAGE OF THE PROCESS 
YES ONCE THE WALL IS UP AROUND IT 
WE CAN TAKE THE CENTERING OUT AND THE ARCH WILL SUPPORT ITSELF 
AND PUTTING UP ARCHES LIKE THIS IS THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCK OF CREATING A CATHEDRAL 
VERY MUCH SO YOU CAN CREATE VERY LARGE SPACES INSIDE THE BUILDING 
WITH MUCH BIGGER ARCHES THAN THIS 
IT'S THE SAME TECHNIQUE THAT THE MEDIEVAL MASONS WOULD HAVE USED 
MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF WOOD WERE REQUIRED TO BUILD THE CATHEDRALS 
ALMOST ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TREES HAD TO BE CUT DOWN TO BUILD SALISBURY CATHEDRAL 
OFTEN THE WOOD WASN'T AVAILABLE LOCALLY 
AND HAD TO BE SOURCED FROM ABROAD 
PINE FROM THE BALTIC OAK FROM IRELAND 
ENTIRE FORESTS ARE LOCKED UP IN THE WALLS OF THE CATHEDRALS 
AND TO GET THE GREAT WOODEN BEAMS AND PIECES OF STONE 
UP FROM GROUND LEVEL 
MASONS AND CARPENTERS USED ROPES WINCHES PULLEYS LADDERS 
AND THE BIG BERTHA OF THEM ALL 
THIS IS THE WINDLASS THAT THE MASONS WOULD HAVE USED 
TO LIFT ENORMOUS BLOCKS OF STONE 
TO THE UPPER LEVELS OF THEIR CONSTRUCTION SITE 
BY HOLDING ONE OF THESE PEGS AND TURNING THIS GREAT WOODEN WHEEL 
A MASON COULD LIFT MORE THAN TEN TIMES HIS OWN WEIGHT 
AS THE WHEEL TURNED THE TIMBER BEAM TURNED 
AND DOWN HERE 
YOU CAN SEE THE GOUGE MARKS MADE BY THE ROPES AS THEY LIFTED THE STONES 
IT WAS A PRECARIOUS AND DANGEROUS BUSINESS 
THIS STRANGE LITTLE CARVING 
SHOWS A MASON FALLING FROM THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE BUILDING 
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM 
BUT WE DO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO WILLIAM OF SENS AT CANTERBURY 
SOME YEARS INTO THE PROJECT 
HE WAS WORKING FIFTY F. T. ABOVE THE FLOOR UP AMONG THE ROOF TIMBERS 
SUDDENLY THE BEAMS BROKE UNDER HIS FEET 
HE FELL TO THE GROUND STONES AND TIMBERS ACCOMPANYING HIS FALL 
SORELY BRUISED BY THE BLOWS OF THE BEAMS AND THE STONES 
HE WAS RENDERED HELPLESS ALIKE TO HIMSELF AND FOR THE WORK 
WILLIAM WAS PARALYSED AND HAD TO RETURN TO FRANCE 
BUT GOTHIC WAS HERE TO STAY 
NO ONE HAD SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE 
THE LAVISH USE OF POLISHED STONE 
THE VAST EXPANSES OF JEWEL LIKE GLASS 
THIS NEW EAST END WAS FOUR METRES HIGHER THAN ITS PREDECESSOR 
AND A THIRD LONGER 
BUT WHAT WAS REALLY REVOLUTIONARY ABOUT IT 
WAS THE USE IT MADE OF THE POINTED ARCH 
THIS GAVE THE INTERIOR A KIND OF TENSE HARMONY 
THAT WAS NOVEL MODERN ALMOST SHOCKING 
CANTERBURY AND THE CATHEDRALS THAT FOLLOWED IT 
SEEMED TO FLOAT HEAVENWARDS INFUSED WITH COLOUR AND LIGHT 
WITHIN A GENERATION OF GOTHIC APPEARING IN BRITAIN 
IT HAD DEVELOPED INTO AN INNOVATIVE NATIVE STYLE 
WHERE THE FRENCH BUILT HIGH AND AUSTERE 
IN ENGLAND GOTHIC WOULD TURN INTO SOMETHING RICH AND ORNATE 
OFTEN DRAMATIC SOMETIMES FANTASTICAL 
AT THE CATHEDRAL IN WELLS 
THE GOTHIC STYLE CAME TO BE USED IN A WHOLLY NEW WAY 
EVERY YEAR ON PALM SUNDAY 
THE CATHEDRAL BUILDING ITSELF BECAME A STAGE SET FOR RELIGIOUS RITUAL 
DRESSED IN THEIR MOST MAGNIFICENTLY EMBROIDERED CLOTHES 
THE CLERGY FORMED A GREAT PROCESSION 
WHICH WOULD HEAD TOWARDS THE GRAND WEST FRONT 
CLOUDS OF INCENSE SURROUNDED THEM 
THEY WERE ABOUT TO TAKE PART IN A PIECE OF SACRED THEATRE 
RE ENACTING CHRIST'S ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM 
LIFT UP YOUR HEADS O. YE GATES SO THE KING OF GLORY CAN COME IN 
THEY CHANTED IN LATIN 
IT WAS THE ARCHITECTURE THAT ANSWERED BACK 
FOR BEHIND THE WEST FRONT WITH ITS ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX LIFE SIZED PAINTED STATUES 
THE BUILDERS HAD CREATED A SPACE FOR A HIDDEN CHOIR 
THE STATUES SEEMED TO SING OUT THE RESPONSE ACROSS THE CATHEDRAL CLOSE 
FOR A FEW BRIEF MOMENTS ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE 
AND A KIND OF SACRED THEATRE HAD FUSED 
AND THIS CHURCH IN THE ENGLISH WEST COUNTRY 
HAD BECOME JERUSALEM ITSELF 
MEDIEVAL CATHEDRALS REVELLED IN THESE KINDS OF DRAMATIC EFFECTS 
COLOUR WAS EVERYWHERE 
WALLS WERE WHITEWASHED AND PAINTED WITH PATTERNS AND SACRED SCENES 
CARVINGS BROUGHT TO LIFE WITH PAINT 
COLUMNS POLISHED TO LOOK LIKE PRECIOUS STONES 
AND PERHAPS THE KEY INNOVATION OF GOTHIC 
HUGE WINDOWS TO ALLOW THE LIGHT OF GOD TO POUR IN 
FILTERED THROUGH RICHLY STAINED GLASS 
STAGE LIGHTING FOR THE THEATRE OF GOTHIC 
THE SPECTACULAR EAST WINDOW OF YORK MINSTER WAS DESIGNED 
BY JOHN THORNTON OF COVENTRY IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY 
IT TELLS THE STORY OF THE CREATION AND THE END OF THE WORLD 
TODAY IT'S UNDER REPAIR 
THE CONSERVATORS USING MUCH THE SAME TECHNIQUE AS THE MEDIEVAL GLAZIERS 
THE STARTING POINT IS A CARTOON 
THE ARTIST NOT ONLY NEEDS TO DRAW IN THE DETAIL ON A PLAN OR A CARTOON 
BUT ALSO NEEDS TO TELL THE GLASS CUTTER WHERE TO CUT THE GLASS 
IN THE MEDIEVAL TIMES WHEN THIS PANEL WAS BEING MADE 
THE DARK LINES WOULD HAVE INDICATED WHERE TO CUT 
SO YOU NEED TO CUT GLASS FIRST 
THE GLASS COULD BE BROUGHT IN FROM THE CONTINENT 
WE THINK FRANCE OR THE LOW COUNTRIES 
BECAUSE THEY WERE MAKING THE BEST QUALITY OF GLASS AT THAT TIME 
THE IMPURITIES IN THE MATERIALS THAT MAKE UP THE GLASS 
GIVE IT A BEAUTIFUL TINT OF GREENISH OR YELLOWISH 
SO THE BORDER PIECES ARE TINTED GLASS 
BUT IF YOU LOOK INSIDE YOU CAN SEE DIFFERENT COLOUR GLASSES RED BLUE 
THAT WOULD BE BROUGHT IN AS BLUE GLASS 
AT THE MOLTEN STAGE OXIDES WOULD BE ADDED 
IN THIS CASE COBALT WOULD BE ADDED TO THE MELTING POT 
TO MAKE THAT GLASS BLUE 
THE ROUGH SHAPES WOULD HAVE BEEN LAID OUT AND THEN FINELY GROZED 
BY JUST NIBBLING AWAY AT THE EDGES WITH A BAR 
ONCE THE GLASS WAS LAID ON THE SHEET THE PAINTER COULD BEGIN THE WORK 
THEN THE GLASS WAS JOINED TOGETHER USING STRIPS OF LEAD 
WHEN IT WAS PUT IN PLACE IT WAS PERHAPS THE LARGEST STAINED GLASS WINDOW IN EUROPE 
GOTHIC AND STAINED GLASS MADE A PERFECT MARRIAGE 
CATHEDRAL BUILDERS VYED TO MAKE EVER LARGER WINDOWS TO MAKE WALL SPACES EVER SMALLER 
SOME BUILDINGS BECAME MERE SKELETONS OF STONE 
BUT THESE STRUCTURES WITH THEIR GREAT ROOFS AND CEILINGS 
PUSHED OUTWARDS AS WELL AS DOWNWARDS 
THEY NEEDED STRONG SUPPORT 
THE MASONS CAME UP WITH A NEW KIND OF STRUCTURE 
THE FLYING BUTTRESS TAKES THE WEIGHT OF THE BUILDING OUT AND DOWN 
LEAVING ITS WALLS FREE FOR ALL KINDS OF POSSIBILITIES 
WINDOWS COULD GET BIGGER THE STRUCTURE ITSELF COULD GET HIGHER 
AND ARCHES OF ALL KINDS COULD BE MORE DELICATELY DECORATED 
THE FLYING BUTTRESS SIPHONED OFF THE WEIGHT FROM THE WALLS OF THE NAVE 
LEAPFROGGING THE SIDE AISLES AS IT DID SO 
WHERE PRACTICAL NECESSITY MET AESTHETIC ADVENTURE 
CAME A STRANGE FANTASTIC BEAUTY 
FOR MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED YEARS FROM THE LATE TWELFTH CENTURY TO THE EARLY SIXTEENTH 
CATHEDRAL ARCHITECTURE IN ENGLAND ENJOYED A GOLDEN AGE 
WINDOWS MAKE THE UPPER PARTS OF THE CATHEDRAL BRIGHT 
WITH THEIR VIVID AND VARIOUS COLOURS IMITATING THE RAINBOW 
HARD WITHOUT BUT LIKE A HONEYCOMB WITHIN 
IT SEEMS TO BE A THING NOT OF ART BUT OF NATURE 
HOLDING PEOPLE'S MINDS IN SUSPENSE AS THEY WONDER 
SOARING AND LOFTY CLEAR AND RESPLENDENT 
THE LAST PART OF A CATHEDRAL TO BE BUILT 
WAS THE STONE CEILING UNDER THE ROOF LEVEL KNOWN AS A VAULT 
HERE AT GLOUCESTER YOU CAN SEE HOW AS MASONS GREW BOLDER 
THEIR VAULTS BECAME EVER MORE AMBITIOUS 
THE GREAT BREAKTHROUGH CAME WITH THE INVENTION OF THE RIB VAULT 
THESE SMALL DIAGONAL ARCHES 
MADE IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD VAULTS THERE WERE BIGGER AND HIGHER 
THOUGH AT FIRST THEY WERE BUILT TO STRENGTHEN THE VAULT 
AND HIDE UGLY JOINS IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY 
MASONS BEGAN TO EXPLOIT THE PURELY DECORATIVE EFFECTS OF THESE RIBS 
THEY ADD THESE DIAGONAL RIBS WHICH ARE CALLED TIERCERONS 
THAT ARE MORE DECORATIVE SIMPLY ABOUT MAKING PATTERNS 
SOON YOU ARE IN WHAT WE CALL THE DECORATIVED STYLE 
YOU'RE HEADING THROUGH THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
AND PEOPLE START TO GET REALLY CARRIED AWAY THEY ADD LITTLE 
SHORT RIBS WHICH ARE JUST THERE 
TO MAKE THREE DIMENSIONAL PATTERNS ON A CURVED STONE ROOF 
ABOVE THE LADY CHAPEL AT GLOUCESTER CATHEDRAL 
YOU CAN REALLY GET A SENSE OF HOW SUCH ELABORATE VAULTS WERE CONSTRUCTED 
FIFTY F. T. ABOVE THE GROUND 
THE MASTER MASON SHOWS ME THE REVERSE SIDE OF THE VAULT 
O. K. SO WE ARE ON TOP OF THE LADY CHAPEL HERE 
AND WE'RE GOING TO CLIMB 
OVER THIS VAULT SO WE WILL HAVE A GOOD VIEW 
ON THE STRUCTURE 
YOU HAVE A VOLUME OF SPACE TO COVER WITH A PARTICULAR CEILING 
WHICH IN THAT CASE IS A GOTHIC VAULT 
SO FIRST YOU FIT THAT SPACE WITH A SCAFFOLDING FRAME MADE OF WOOD 
YOU POSITION THE WOOD ARCHES 
THE WOOD CENTRING 
WHICH ARE JUST UNDERNEATH THE STONE RIBS 
IT WILL SUPPORT ALL THE INDIVIDUAL STONES CONSTITUTING THE STONE RIBS 
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE YOU HAVE GOT THE MAIN ARCH THE MAIN RIBS 
AND THEY'RE ALL GOOD SOLID STONE 
BUT YOU SEE THAT FUNNY LOOKING STONE INBETWEEN 
THAT'S TUFA IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS VERY VERY LIGHT 
AND SPONGY AND VERY LIGHT 
IT'S A MATERIAL WHICH IS PROBABLY LESS THAN 
HALF THE WEIGHT OF NORMAL STONE 
YOU CAN EXTRACT IT QUARRY IT IN THE FIELD 
WHEN IT IS FRESH IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY SOFT 
THEN EXPOSED TO THE AIR IT WILL HARDEN VERY QUICKLY 
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE TWO MARKS THE DOUBLE EDGED AXE MARKS 
WHICH WAS THE PRIMARY TOOL OF THE MEDIEVAL MASON 
TO PRODUCE QUICKLY A UNIT OF STONE 
SO IT WAS DONE IN THERE AND HE STARTED AT THAT CORNER AND CAME DOWN 
THEY ARE THE TYPICAL RADIATING MARKS 
OF THE DOUBLE EDGED AXE GOING DOWN THAT WAY 
SO THESE LARGE SQUARE STONE 
THEY ARE AT THE JUNCTION OF ALL THE RIBS AND THE CARVING OF THE BUST 
IS TO HIDE THIS JUNCTION AND TO MAKE A USE OF THIS JUNCTION 
AND IT ALSO IT WAS A USEFUL DEVICE TO HIDE POSSIBLE INACCURACIES 
WHERE IT WAS NOT QUITE MEETING 
WHICH WAS OCCURING FROM TIME TO TIME 
IN THE CLOISTERS AT GLOUCESTER 
MASTERY IN STONE AND AESTHETIC AMBITION REACH A CLIMAX 
THE FAN VAULT MUST RANK AS ONE OF THE MARVELS OF THE ENGLISH GOTHIC STYLE 
THESE TRUMPET LIKE CONES COVERED IN CARVED PATTERNS 
WERE UNLIKE ANYTHING SEEN BEFORE 
THE FAN VAULT DISPENSES WITH RIBS ALTOGETHER 
IT IS JUST A SKIN OF CARVED STONE A FEW INCHES THICK 
LIKE AN EGGSHELL 
YET THE EFFECT HAS ALL THE DELICACY OF LACE 
IT WAS A KIND OF EUREKA MOMENT FOR THE MEDIEVAL MASONS 
INSTEAD OF RIBS THEY SIMPLY BUILD A SMOOTH CURVED SURFACE 
SPREADING OUT EVENLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS LIKE AN INVERTED DOME 
THE SURFACE WAS COVERED WITH REPEATED PATTERNS 
REFLECTING THOSE THAT RAN OVER THE WALLS AND WINDOWS BELOW 
AGAIN NO MATHS OR PHYSICS WERE NEEDED JUST WHAT WORKED 
THE IDEA IS INSPIRED 
BUT THE ENGINEERING NOT MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN CONSTRUCTING AN IGLOO 
THE FAN VAULT WAS ONE OF THE LAST GREAT INNOVATIONS 
IN THREE CENTURIES OF GOTHIC 
GROWING TECHNICAL SOPHISTICATION 
FED A DEMAND FOR MORE ELABORATE ARCHITECTURE 
PATRONS WANTED MORE OF EVERYTHING MORE VARIETY RICHER PATTERNS 
MORE FANTASTIC DESIGNS AND MORE BREATHTAKING ARCHITECTURAL EFFECTS 
ALL OVER ENGLAND 
THE GREAT CATHEDRALS WERE REBUILT IN THE RICH NEW STYLE 
FROM THE SOARING NAVE OF CANTERBURY 
TO THE ELEGANT CHOIR AT SALISBURY 
AND THE LUMINOUS STAINED GLASS OF YORK 
SUMPTUOUS LADY CHAPELS WERE ADDED 
BORNE OF A PASSIONATE NEW ATTACHMENT TO THE VIRGIN MARY 
BUT THERE WAS A PRICE TO BE PAID FOR SUCH AMBITION 
AT LINCOLN IN THE THE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETIES 
THE CATHEDRAL WAS REBUILT IN AN ELABORATELY ORNAMENTED GOTHIC STYLE 
SO CARRIED AWAY WAS THE MASTER MASON HE NEGLECTED TO BUILD COLUMNS 
STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD UP THE TOWER HE WAS ABOUT TO BUILD 
THE RESULT 
BEFORE THE TOWER WAS EVEN FINISHED IT CAME CRASHING TO THE GROUND 
YET MEDIEVAL MASONS WERE GOOD AT TURNING DISASTER INTO TRIUMPH 
THE CENTRAL TOWER OF WELLS CATHEDRAL 
ALSO SHOWED SIGNS OF IMMINENT COLLAPSE IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
THE MASONS CAME UP WITH AN ASTONISHING SOLUTION 
GIGANTIC SCISSOR ARCHES THAT BRACED THE ARCHES SUPPORTING THE TOWER 
THIS BIZARRE BUT GRACEFUL EDITION STABILISED THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE 
BUT THE MOST INNOVATIVE RESPONSE TO CALAMITY 
HAPPENED TWO HUNDRED MILES TO THE EAST 
ON TWELFTH FEBRUARY IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO 
THE MONKS OF ELY CATHEDRAL HAD JUST SUNG MATINS 
SUDDENLY AND SWIFTLY 
THE BELL TOWER CRASHED DOWN UPON THE CHOIR 
WITH SUCH A THUNDEROUS NOISE ONE MIGHT THINK AN EARTHQUAKE HAD OCCURRED 
THE FALL DEVASTATED THE CENTRAL PART OF THE CATHEDRAL 
AND PLUNGED THE SENIOR MONK ALAN OF WALSINGHAM INTO DESPAIR 
ALAN OF WALSINGHAM WOULD HAVE BEEN FACED BY AN ENORMOUS PILE OF RUBBLE 
THE FIRST THING TO DO WAS SIMPLY TO CLEAR THAT 
AND PERHAPS AS HE WAS DOING IT AN IDEA MIGHT HAVE BEGUN 
TO TAKE SHAPE OF QUITE A BOLD SOLUTION 
TO THE PROBLEM OF HOW TO REPLACE A FALLEN NORMAN TOWER 
THE CHURCH LIKE ALL OTHER CHURCHES HAD FOUR GREAT ARMS 
EAST AND WEST AND NORTH AND SOUTH 
AND AN ENTIRE SECTION AT EACH OF THESE FOUR ARMS WAS DEMOLISHED 
MAKING THEM SHORTER AND THIS SPACE MUCH BIGGER 
AND THEN HE JOINED THESE FOUR ARMS WITH FOUR ANGLED WALLS 
CREATING AN ENORMOUS OCTAGONAL SPACE ABOUT TWENTY THREE METRES WIDE 
HAVING LAID THIS OUT 
THE MASONS HAD TO DIG DOWN TWO OR THREE METRES FIND NEW FOUNDATIONS 
AND THEN THEY STARTED TO BUILD UPWARDS 
AND THEY WENT UP AND UP TWENTY OR THIRTY METRES INTO THE SKY 
BUT THEY WEREN'T REALLY BUILDING WALLS BUT A KIND OF SKIN 
A SKIN PIERCED BY ENORMOUS ARCHES 
THE KIND OF THING THAT IS ONLY POSSIBLE WITH GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE 
AND WHEN HE'D FINISHED HE HAD AN OCTAGON OF STONE 
AND THE QUESTION WAS WHAT TO PUT ON TOP OF IT 
TO ROOF THIS ENORMOUS OCTAGONAL SPACE 
ALAN OF WALSINGHAM WORKED WITH ONE OF THE KING'S MASTER CARPENTERS 
THE THE PLAN WAS TO DO IT ALL IN WOOD 
TIMBERS HAD TO BE SOURCED 
SOME OF THESE ARE TWELVE METRES LONG 
AND THEY ARE STILL COVERED WITH AXE MARKS MADE BY MEDIEVAL WORKERS 
BETWEEN THEM THEY DEVISED AN INGENIOUS WOODEN FRAMEWORK 
A COLOSSAL STRUCTURE 
WHICH LITERALLY SITS ON TOP OF THE STONE SHEATH OF WALLS THEY HAD ALREADY CREATED 
AND RISES UP FROM IT GOING HIGHER AND HIGHER 
SO THAT IT SUSPENDS A GREAT WOODEN VAULT 
WHICH FROM UNDERNEATH LOOKS LIKE IT'S ALMOST WEIGHTLESS 
ONCE AGAIN MEDIEVAL CRAFTSMEN HAD TURNED A DISASTER 
INTO A COLOSSAL PIECE OF ARCHITECTURAL THEATRE 
OF ALL THE SPINE TINGLING MOMENTS OF THE MEDIEVAL CATHEDRALS 
THIS HAS TO BE THE TOPS 
ALL THE LINES OF THIS ENORMOUS OCTAGONAL SPACE 
RISE UP AND CONVERGE 
AND JUST WHEN YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO JOIN 
THEY STOP AND GO UP AGAIN INTO A CAGE OF COLOURED LIGHT 
AND RIGHT AT THE TOP AT THE HEART OF IT ALL 
IS A BEAUTIFUL CARVING OF CHRIST IN MAJESTY 
THE OCTAGON AT ELY CATHEDRAL SURVIVES FROM THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTIES 
A DECADE OF ARCHITECTURAL BRILLIANCE 
WHOSE MASONS SHOULD BE AS FAMOUS AS TURNER OR SHAKESPEARE 
BUT THIS WAS NOT AN AGE OF EGO 
THE REPUTATION OF THESE MEN LIES BURIED IN THE STONEWORK 
AND SOARING VAULTS OF THESE AMAZING BUILDINGS 
THE CATHEDRALS TODAY ARE A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME NOT A MOMENT IN TIME 
EACH ONE HAS BEEN REBUILT OR EXTENDED SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE CENTURIES 
NOT A SINGLE ONE IS AS IT WAS WHEN IT WAS FIRST BUILT 
TO WALK THROUGH AN ENGLISH CATHEDRAL 
IS TO WALK THROUGH THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND AND ITS ARCHITECTURE 
HERE AT ELY FOR EXAMPLE THE GREAT ROUND ARCHES OF THE NAVE 
WITH THEIR MASSIVE PILLARS DATE BACK TO THE CONQUERING NORMANS 
WALK ALONG AND YOU ENTER THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY AND THE POINTED ARCHES OF GOTHIC 
FURTHER STILL AND YOU GET TO THE VERY END OF THE MEDIEVAL ERA 
WITH ITS PASSION FOR CARVING THAT LOOKS LESS LIKE STONE THAN CRYSTALLISED FOAM 
BUT THE TIME WOULD COME WHEN THE GREAT CATHEDRALS 
NO LONGER EXERTED THE SAME FASCINATION 
THE INTELLECTUAL AND RELIGIOUS PASSION 
THAT HAD FIRED THE MEDIEVAL BUILDERS WAS CHANGING 
WEALTHY PATRONS PUT THEIR MONEY INTO PRIVATE CHAPELS 
RATHER THAN GREAT CHURCHES 
AND IN THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTIES THE RELIGIOUS WORLD OF ENGLAND WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN 
PROTESTANTS AND PURITANS PUT HAMMERS AND CHISELS TO A VERY DIFFERENT USE 
BUT THE SPLENDOUR OF THE GREAT CATHEDRALS THE COMMITMENT 
AND SKILL OF THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED THEM THESE REMAIN 
REMINDERS OF A GLORIOUS AMBITION 
TO REALISE THE VISION OF THE BOOK OF REVELATION 
TO BUILD HEAVEN ON EARTH 
THE NEW JERUSALEM PURE GOLD LIKE UNTO CLEAR GLASS 
GARNISHED WITH PRECIOUS STONES 
NEEDED NEITHER THE SUN NOR THE MOON TO SHINE IN IT 
FOR THE GLORY OF GOD DID LIGHTEN IT
