WHEN I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD I CAME HERE TO JOIN THE CHOIR OF SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL IN LONDON 
OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR SO I LEARNT REHEARSED AND PERFORMED 
SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND PROFOUND MUSIC EVER WRITTEN FOR THE HUMAN VOICE 
I MUST CONFESS THAT OVER THAT PERIOD I PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE STORIES BEHIND THIS WONDERFUL MUSIC 
BUT NOW I'VE BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE TO MAKE A JOURNEY TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE LIVES 
AND THE BELIEFS OF THOSE THAT SANG IT AND THOSE WHO COMPOSED IT 
IN THIS SERIES I'M GOING ON A PILGRIMAGE TO INVESTIGATE FOUR LANDMARKS 
IN THE HISTORY OF WESTERN SACRED MUSIC 
THIS IS A STORY OF A THOUSAND YEARS OF PRAISE THROUGH SONG 
MY JOURNEY WILL TAKE ME ACROSS EUROPE 
TO THE ETERNAL CITY OF ROME TO DISCOVER HOW THE MUSIC OF THE VATICAN POWERED THE RENAISSANCE 
TO TUDOR BRITAIN AND A COUNTRY IN TURMOIL AS CATHOLIC WORSHIP IS DRIVEN UNDERGROUND 
AND TO GERMANY WHERE PROTESTANT MUSIC REACHED ITS ZENITH WITH THE GENIUS OF BACH 
BUT FIRST I'M LEAVING LONDON FOR MEDIEVAL PARIS 
TO FOLLOW THE STORY OF THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF CHRISTIAN CHURCH MUSIC 
FROM THE HAUNTING SIMPLICITY OF PLAINCHANT 
TO THE FULL GLORY OF GOTHIC POLYPHONY 
OUR STARTING POINT IS THE CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE DAME IN PARIS 
THE BUILDING AT THE HEART OF THE GOTHIC REVOLUTION 
THAT TOOK PLACE IN NORTHERN FRANCE AT THE END OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
AN EXPLOSION OF CREATIVITY THAT BROUGHT THE CUTTING EDGE OF MEDIEVAL TECHNOLOGY 
TOGETHER WITH THE OUTER LIMITS OF MUSICAL EXPERIMENTATION 
THE RESULT WAS A SOUND THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD BEFORE HARMONY 
THIS IS MUSIC WHICH CAN ILLUMINATE NOT ONLY THE WORLD OF THE CHURCH 
BUT ALSO THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE WHO COMPOSED PERFORMED AND HEARD IT 
TO HELP ME EXPLORE THIS MEDIEVAL BIG BANG HARRY CHRISTOPHERS THE MUSICAL DIRECTOR OF THE SIXTEEN 
HAS CHOSEN FOUR OF HIS SPECIALIST SINGERS TENORS MARK DOBELL AND SIMON BERRIDGE 
BARITONE EAMON DOUGAN 
AND BASS JONATHAN ARNOLD 
HAVE BROUGHT THEIR EARLY MUSIC EXPERTISE TO THE GOTHIC BASILICA OF SAINT DENIS IN THE NORTH OF PARIS 
WHEN THESE CATHEDRALS WERE BEING BUILT THE MUSICIANS WERE CREATING THIS SOUND TO MATCH THE BUILDING 
AND THE TWO WORKED HAND IN HAND 
IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT MUSIC WAS THERE FOR THE GLORY OF GOD 
THE BUILDINGS WERE THERE FOR THE GLORY OF GOD 
WHEN IT WAS FIRST HEARD IT MUST HAVE BEEN JUST 
I MEAN THE MOST MODERN THING ANYBODY HAD EVER HEARD 
THIS IS SAINT JULIEN LE PAUVRE ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE SEINE 
FROM HERE I CAN SEE NOTRE DAME ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER 
BOTH CHURCHES WERE BEING BUILT AT AROUND THE SAME TIME THE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTIES AND ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTIES 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF SAINT JULIEN GREW FROM GENERATIONS OF TRADITIONAL BUILDERS' KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE 
SALVE REGINA 
MATER MISERICORDIAE 
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS THIS WAS THE STANDARD CHURCH ARCHITECTURE 
THICK WALLS ENCLOSING AN INTERIOR LIKE A SORT OF CHAMBERED CAVE 
DIVIDED BY THESE MASSIVE PILLARS SUPPORTING THE CEILING 
AND PUNCTUATED BY SMALL ROUND ARCHED WINDOWS 
AD TE CLAMAMUS 
EXSULES 
AND THE MUSIC THAT FILLED THIS SPACE WAS PLAINSONG 
OR SINGLE LINES OF CHANT SIMPLE EFFECTIVE AND BEAUTIFUL 
ONE PURE LINE OF MELODY WITHOUT ANY ACCOMPANIMENT OR HARMONY 
AND IN FREE TIME THE ONLY SENSE OF TEMPO OR RHYTHM BEING DETERMINED BY THE LENGTH OF THE PHRASE BEING SUNG 
AND THE CAPACITY OF THE SINGER'S LUNGS 
LACRIMARUM VALLEO 
WELL PLAINSONG STARTED WAY BACK IN THE SIXTH CENTURY REALLY 
AND IT BECAME THE FOCAL POINT OF THE SINGING IN THE SERVICES BEAUTIFUL SIMPLE LINES 
THAT COULD WITHIN THAT GET QUITE ELABORATE 
THE PRINCIPLE THING IS A VOCAL LINE THAT'S EASILY MEMORABLE 
AND THE CONGREGATIONS WOULD HAVE KNOW THESE LINES AND SUNG ALONG WITH THEM 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S A SINGLE LINE IT'S INCREDIBLY EXPRESSIVE 
SALUTARE DEI NOSTRI 
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THERE WAS NO MUSICAL NOTATION 
THE MANUSCRIPTS USED BY THE CHOIR CONTAINED NOTHING BUT THE TEXT 
THE MELODIES HAD TO BE LEARNED BY HEART AND PERFORMED FROM MEMORY 
IT TOOK TEN YEARS FOR A SINGER TO LEARN THE FULL REPERTOIRE OF HIS OWN CHURCH COMMUNITY 
BUT SAINT JULIEN AND PLAINSONG REPRESENT THE PAST 
NOTRE DAME AND ITS MUSIC IS THE FUTURE 
I'M STANDING IN THE PLACE DU PARVIS NOTRE DAME AND THERE SHE IS NOTRE DAME HERSELF 
IN THE LATE TWELFTH CENTURY THIS AREA WAS A MAZE OF OVERCROWDED STREETS 
CRAMMED WITH STUDENTS ECCLESIASTICALS ARTISANS AND MERCHANTS 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE TO SEE THIS HUGE ELABORATE BUILDING 
OVERSHADOWING THE MEDIEVAL CITY 
BUT THIS WASN'T JUST A BIG NEW CATHEDRAL IT WAS A GOTHIC STATEMENT IN STONE AND GLASS 
A REVOLUTIONARY BUILDING 
WHAT WAS NEW ABOUT IT 
WHAT'S NEW IS THE GOTHIC STYLE IS REALLY REVOLUTIONARY 
IN CERTAIN TECHNIQUES OF CONSTRUCTION 
AND THESE TECHNIQUES ALLOWED 
FOR THINNER MORE SLENDER MUCH MORE ELEGANT BUILDINGS 
GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE INVENTION OF THE RIB VAULT 
AND A RIB VAULT IS WHAT I'D SEE IF I LOOKED UP AT THE CEILING YES A RIB VAULT IS LIKE 
THE BONES OF THE BODY WHICH WERE THEN FLESHED OUT WITH TISSUES AND SKIN 
SO THERE'S AN ENTIRE NEW APPROACH TO THE SKELETON 
AND THEN ABOUT THIRTY YEARS INTO THE HISTORY OF GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE 
SOME MAGNIFICENT BUILDER INVENTS APPLIES THE FLYING BUTTRESS 
AND THIS IS THE FIRST IMPORTANT CHURCH WHERE THE FLYING BUTTRESS IS EMPLOYED 
AND THE FLYING BUTTRESS ALLOWED WHAT THE FLYING BUTTRESS ALLOWS WHAT I'D CALL PRECISE 
TACTICAL SUPPORT AT THE VERY POINT ON THE UPPER PART OF THE WALL WHERE YOU NEED IT 
AND IT BEARS WHAT WE CALL THE COMPRESSION LOAD 
IF YOU COULD STRIP AWAY THE SKIN OF THE BUILDING 
YOU WOULD FIND THE FLYING BUTTRESS TOUCHING ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE WALL 
AND THAT CORRESPONDS PRECISELY TO THE POINT WHERE THE RIB VAULT COMES DOWN 
THE HIGHEST POINT OF PRESSURE YES GOTHIC CATHEDRALS CAN BE MUCH THINNER IN THE WALLS 
BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT SYSTEM OF THE RIB VAULTS UP ON THE TOP 
COUPLED WITH THE FLYING BUTTRESSES ON THE OUTSIDE 
FLYING BUTTRESSES EVEN THE TERM IS FAINTLY GLAMOROUS 
THAT PROVIDED THE TECHNOLOGY NEW MEDIEVAL SPACE EFFORT 
TRANSFERRING THE THRUST DOWNWARDS OR ESSENTIALLY PROPPING UP THE WALLS 
GOETHE CALLED ARCHITECTURE FROZEN MUSIC 
AND LINKED DIRECTLY TO THE BUILDING OF THIS MONUMENTAL STRUCTURE 
IS A SECOND CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT MUSICAL TRIUMPH 
A NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SOUND 
YOU CAN FIND IT IN THE MAGNUS LIBER THE GREAT BOOK 
THE SINGLE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT IN MEDIEVAL MUSIC 
AT THE TIME WHEN VIRTUALLY NO MUSIC WAS WRITTEN DOWN 
THIS IS A UNIQUE AND PERMANENT RECORD OF THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF WESTERN MUSIC 
IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM IT CONTAINS A CYCLE OF MUSIC FOR THE ENTIRE CHURCH YEAR 
AND CRUCIALLY IT SHOWS THE EVOLUTION FROM SINGLE LINES OF CHANT 
TO POLYPHONIC OR MANY VOICED MUSIC 
IT'S ONE OF THE IRONIES OF HISTORY THAT WHILE THE MASTER BUILDERS 
OF THIS MAGNIFICENT CATHEDRAL REMAIN UNKNOWN 
WE DO KNOW THE NAMES OF TWO FRENCH COMPOSERS OF THIS PERIOD 
LEONIN AND HIS SUCCESSOR PEROTIN 
WHO BOTH MADE MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE MUSIC OF NOTRE DAME 
AND IN PARTICULAR THE MAGNUS LIBER 
THEIR COMPOSITIONS TOGETHER WITH THOSE OF THEIR ANONYMOUS FRENCH CONTEMPORARIES 
ARE KNOWN COLLECTIVELY AS THE MUSIC OF THE NOTRE DAME SCHOOL 
THE KEY WORK OF THE NOTRE DAME SCHOOL VIDERUNT OMNES 
A STANDARD BIBLICAL TEXT IT HAD BEEN CHANTED AS PLAINSONG FOR CENTURIES 
BUT IN THE HANDS OF LEONIN IT WAS TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING RADICALLY NEW AND DIFFERENT 
SALUTARE 
LEONIN DID SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL BECAUSE HE TOOK THE PLAINSONG 
PUT IT INTO LONG NOTES VERY LONG NOTES SO THE FIRST NOTE REALLY DOES SUSTAIN FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
VI VI VI VI VI VI 
STRETCHING OUT THE PLAINSONG LEONIN PRODUCED SEQUENCES OF LONG LOW DRONE NOTES 
OVER THE TOP OF WHICH A SECOND VOICE COULD ELABORATE THE BIRTH OF HARMONY 
VI VI VI VI DER 
THE PART THAT I SING IS REALLY A BARITONE BASS PART 
YOU WERE SUSTAINING VERY VERY LONG NOTES FOR VERY LONG PERIODS OF TIME 
UNDER THE MORE FLORID TEXTURE OF THE UPPER VOICE 
VIDERUNT OMNES FINES TERRA ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH HAVE SEEN 
SALUTARE DEI NOSTRI THE SALVATION OF OUR GOD 
JUBILATE DEO MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE TO GOD 
OMNIS TERRA ALL THE EARTH 
IT IS OF COURSE PARTLY ABOUT THE PROCESS OF SINGING AND OF MAKING MUSIC 
BUT NOW THOSE TWO LATIN WORDS VIDERUNT OMNES TAKE MINUTES TO SING 
WHAT YOU'RE LOSING IS ANY SENSE OF THE VIDERUNT TEXT MAKING SENSE 
BUT WHAT YOU DO GAIN BY LEONIN'S NEW SETTING OF THESE TEXTS 
IS A DANCE LIKE SPIRITUAL JOYOUS MUSIC 
O. O. OMNES 
THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE MODERN HARMONIC LANDSCAPE WITH ITS VERY LOW BASS AND HIGH TREBLE 
HERE IS AN EXQUISITE SMOOTHNESS OF INTERLOCKING VOICES 
AND A SENSE OF INFINITY WHICH FOR MANY MUSICIANS 
REFLECTS A STATE OF PERFECTION 
DEI NOSTRI 
VIRTUALLY ALL WE KNOW ABOUT THE MUSIC OF THE NOTRE DAME SCHOOL 
COMES FROM AN IMPORTANT BUT ANONYMOUS TREATISE WRITTEN IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY 
SO LONG AFTER THE COMPOSERS OF THE MUSIC WERE DEAD 
WE DON'T KNOW THE AUTHOR'S NAME AND SO HE'S REFERRED TO IMAGINATIVELY AS ANONYMOUS THE FOURTH 
BUT WE DO KNOW HE WAS AN ENGLISH STUDENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS 
AND POSSIBLY FROM BURY SAINT EDMUNDS AND THAT THANKFULLY HIS BLUFFERS GUIDE TO SINGING HAS SURVIVED 
ANONYMOUS THE FOURTH WROTE IN THIS CRUCIAL DOCUMENT THAT A COMPOSER CALLED LEONIN 
COMPILED A COLLECTION OF MUSICAL SCORES FOR THE SINGERS OF NOTRE DAME 
THE MAGNUS LIBER 
PROFESSOR MARK EVERIST HAS MADE A SPECIAL STUDY OF THE HANDFUL OF SURVIVING MEDIEVAL MANUSCRIPTS 
AND TRANSCRIBED SOME OF THE MUSIC USED IN OUR SINGERS' PERFORMANCE SCORES 
MARK THE MAGNUS LIBER THE GREAT BOOK 
CAN I TRY AND DEFINE WHAT PRECISELY IT IS BECAUSE IT ISN'T A BOOK 
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S NOT REALLY A BOOK AT ALL 
THERE'S A KIND OF WEIRD DESCRIPTION OF THE MAGNUS LIBER 
AS A COLLECTION OF MUSIC 
POLYPHONIC MUSIC TWO PARTS FOR THE ELABORATION OF MASS AND DIVINE OFFICE 
WHERE'S THIS COME FROM THIS COMES FROM ANONYMOUS THE FOURTH ANONYMOUS THE FOURTH 
I'M GUESSING HIM BUT WHO KNOWS ANONYMOUS THE FOURTH IS REALLY INTERESTING HE'S THE FIRST WRITER ABOUT MUSIC 
TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT MUSIC AND ITS PAST 
SO HE'S WRITING IN THE LAST QUARTER OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER LEONIN OUR FIRST MUSICOLOGIST 
YOU COULD VERY WELL SAY THAT AND HE GIVES YOU A STORY 
ABOUT LEONIN THE TYPES OF ECCLESIASTICAL POSITIONS HE HAD 
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY PERFORMING AND COMPOSING THIS MUSIC 
ARE A PARTICULAR GROUP OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL TEAM AT NOTRE DAME 
AND THEY'RE CALLED THE CLERKS OF MATINS 
THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOLO PARTS OF PLAINSONG 
WHICH ALSO TURN INTO THE ELABORATE SECTIONS OF POLYPHONIC MUSIC 
ARE THEY IN HOLY ORDERS BARELY 
THESE GUYS WERE HIRED BY THE YEAR AND SUMMARILY FIRED EVERY YEAR 
ANONYMOUS THE FOURTH TALKS ABOUT THEM AS NOTATERS OF MUSIC 
IN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE WHO WRITE MUSIC DOWN 
FOR THESE PIONEERS OF POLYPHONY 
THE FRANKLY AWE INSPIRING VASTNESS OF THE INTERIOR OF THE GOTHIC CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE DAME 
MUST HAVE BEEN AN EXCITING AND CHALLENGING NEW ACOUSTIC SPACE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME I BEGAN TO GET A REAL SENSE OF WHAT INSPIRED THE NOTRE DAME COMPOSERS 
TO PUSH THEIR SINGERS INTO NEW CHORAL TERRITORY 
DISCOVERING NEW MUSICAL SOUNDS EVEN AS THE BUILDING TOOK SHAPE AROUND THEM 
LEONIN MUST HAVE SPENT MUCH OF HIS CAREER HERE IN THE UNFINISHED CHOIR AT THE EASTEND OF THE CATHEDRAL 
SEPARATED FROM THE INCESSANT NOISE OF BUILDING BY A TEMPORARY SCREEN 
THAT MOVED WESTWARD COLUMN BY COLUMN AS THE YEARS PASSED 
IT'S VERY INTERESTING YOU COME INTO A BUILDING LIKE NOTRE DAME 
AND IF YOU SANG PLAINSONG JUST THAT SINGLE LINE 
YOU'D FIND IN THIS SORT OF ACOUSTIC THE NOTES BLENDING INTO ANOTHER NOTE 
SO YOU'VE GOT THE BASIC FORM OF HARMONY WITH THE ECHO WITH THE ECHO BUILDING WHICH IS FABULOUS 
WE'RE IN A REVOLUTIONARY PLACE IN ITS ARCHITECTURE 
AND THESE COMPOSERS FOLLOWED SUIT AND IS THIS A GOOD SINGING ARCHITECTURE 
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND IT MUST'VE MADE PEOPLE TINGLE WITH EXCITEMENT 
AND IT'S A MEDITATIVE AID ISN'T IT ON A PAR WITH LIGHT THEY WERE DISCOVERING IN THESE BUILDINGS 
THEY WERE USING THIS WONDERFUL NEW BUILDING TO SHAPE 
THE SOUND THEY WERE CREATING AND THERE ARE VERY CLEAR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE WHOLE ARCHITECTURE 
HAVING TO RESEMBLE THE MUSIC THE TWO BEING IN PARTNERSHIP 
I FIND THIS AMAZING IN THIS PARTICULAR BUILDING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME THAT THESE MEN 
HAD THIS REVOLUTIONARY IDEA 
PARIS HAS CHANGED OUT OF ALL RECOGNITION OF COURSE SINCE MEDIEVAL TIMES 
BUT STANDING ON ONE OF THE TOWERS OF THE CATHEDRAL YOU GET SOME SENSE OF THE MEDIEVAL CITY STILL 
I WONDER WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR A MEDIEVAL MAN OR WOMAN TO BE STANDING HERE 
LOOKING DOWN ON THEIR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS DOWN BELOW 
THEY MUST HAVE FELT LIKE GOD OR AN ANGEL 
THE CATHEDRAL DOMINATES THE CITY 
GOD LOOKING OVER THE SPRAWL OF HUMAN LIFE 
ANDREW THE FIRST THING THAT STRUCK ME WHEN I SAW THIS AS A CHILD 
AND IT STILL STRIKES ME NOW IS ITS SIZE 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS EVEN IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PARIS 
WHY IS IT SO BIG 
IT STILL DOMINATES PARIS NOW BUT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
WHEN IT WAS BUILT IT WAS ALL ABOUT POLITICAL CONTROL 
AS WELL AS RELIGIOUS SO THE POLITICAL LEADERS OF THAT TIME 
THE CATHEDRAL WAS FOUNDED BY PHILIPPE AUGUSTE AND HIS BIG IDEA WAS 
THAT PARIS WOULD REPLACE ROME AS THE POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS CENTRE OF EUROPE 
IT HAD BEEN THE AMBITION OF MAURICE DE SULLY WHO COMMISSIONED THE FIRST ARCHITECTS 
THAT THIS WOULD OVERWHELM HE WAS THE FIRST MINISTER OF PHILIPPE AUGUSTE 
THIS WOULD OVERWHELM ANY ROMAN AMBITIONS TO CONTROL EUROPE 
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT A PARISH BUT ABOUT UNIFYING FRANCE AS A COUNTRY 
AND SPREADING POLITICAL CONTROL BEYOND THE BORDERS OF PARIS 
DID IT WORK WERE PEOPLE AMAZED BY ITS GRANDEUR 
DID IT TURN PARIS INTO A RIVAL TO ROME 
PARIS WAS ALREADY A RIVAL INTELLECTUALLY 
IT DREW PEOPLE TO COME AND LOOK IN AWE AT THIS THING 
BUT IT PUT THE STAMP ON WHAT PARIS WAS ALREADY DOING 
THIS IS THE CENTRE OF ALL INTELLECTUAL THEOLOGICAL AUTHORITY IN EUROPE 
WHAT I FIND INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK AT THE HEIGHT OF NOTRE DAME RIGHT NOW 
AND IT LITERALLY OVERSHADOWS ALL THE LITTLE TRANSEPTS AND LITTLE CELLS 
WHERE THE MONKS AND PRIESTS WOULD BE DELIVERING THE WORD OF GOD 
WAS THAT A DELIBERATE STATEMENT ABSOLUTELY 
THE AREA AROUND IT TELL ME A LITTLE ABOUT THE AREA AROUND IT 
ALL OF THIS IS PRETTY SANITISED AND PRETTY CLEAN 
ALL OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN LITTLE ALLEYWAYS STREETS THIS PIAZZA WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HERE 
ALL OF THIS WOULD HAVE LOOKED SOMETHING LIKE CALCUTTA OR CONTEMPORARY BOMBAY 
IT WAS ALSO A VERY FERVID KIND OF PLACE 
THE BORDERS OF PARIS WERE JUST THE BRIDGE THERE AND THE BRIDGE THERE 
IT WAS LINED WITH HUSTLERS THIEVES TARTS PARIS WAS TIGHT 
IT WAS PACKED INTO THAT SPACE 
PROVINCIALS FEARED IT AS A DANGEROUS PLACE COS THEY COULD HEAR THE NOISE OF PARIS 
SEVERAL LEAGUES AWAY AS THEY WOULD PUT IT 
AND THAT WAS WHAT WAS CHARACTERISTIC THE NOISE THE SHOUTS THE TOUTS AND HAWKERS AND ALL THIS STUFF 
TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY TWENTY FOUR HOUR IT WAS A DANGEROUS BUT ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING PLACE 
THE IDEA WAS THAT THE WORD OF GOD DOMINATED EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON 
WE CAN CAPTURE A SENSE OF WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE FROM THE WORKS 
OF PHILOSOPHER AND MUSICIAN PETER ABELARD 
WHO'D ARRIVED IN PARIS FROM THE PROVINCES TO STUDY THEOLOGY 
HE WAS IN HIS OWN ESTIMATION A HANDSOME MAN 
A BRILLIANT SPEAKER A POET A COMPOSER AND VERY VERY CHARISMATIC 
HE TOOK ROOMS HERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE CANON OF NOTRE DAME FULBERT 
IN EXCHANGE HE AGREED TO TUTOR FULBERT'S BELOVED NIECE HELOISE 
SHE WAS CLEVER SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL AND INEVITABLY ABELARD FOUND HER IRRESISTIBLE 
BEFORE LONG IN HELOISE'S ROOM THE COUPLE DISCOVERED AN INTOXICATING COMBINATION 
OF STUDY AND SEX 
OBEYING YOUR COMMAND FROM THE START 
I CHANGED BOTH MY HEART AND MY HABIT 
PROVING YOU TO BE THE ONLY POSSESSOR BOTH OF MY BODY AND OF MY MIND 
I NEVER LOOKED TO MY OWN PASSION 
BUT ONLY TO YOURS WHICH I WAS ALWAYS ZEALOUS TO GRATIFY 
THE COUPLE MARRIED IN SECRET FLED TO BRITTANY AND HAD A SON 
BUT ABELARD COULDN'T RESIST COMING BACK TO THE CENTRE OF INTELLECTUAL LIFE PARIS 
THEIR SECRET MARRIAGE WAS THE TALK OF THE CITY 
BUT WHEN FULBERT FOUND OUT HE PLANNED A GRIZZLY REVENGE 
ONE NIGHT A GROUP OF MEN BROKE INTO ABELARD'S ROOM 
AND IN HIS OWN WORDS CUT OFF THAT WITH WHICH HE HAD COMMITTED THE SIN 
ABELARD AND HELOISE'S LOVE SURVIVED EVEN HIS CASTRATION 
SHE BECAME A NUN HE CONTINUED TO TEACH AND TO STUDY IN PARIS 
WHAT REMAINS TODAY OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS A SERIES OF LETTERS THEY EXCHANGED 
THEY DISPLAY A HEADY AND PERHAPS PECULIARLY FRENCH COMBINATION OF LOVE OF PHILOSOPHY 
AND OF EACH OTHER 
THERE WERE TWO THINGS IN YOU I MUST CONFESS 
WITH WHICH YOU COULD CAPTIVATE THE HEART OF ANY WOMAN 
YOUR SKILL IN MAKING SONGS AND YOUR JOY IN SINGING THEM 
THIS WAS WHY ALL THE GIRLS BURNED AND SIGHED WITH LOVE FOR YOU 
ABELARD COMPOSED A HYMN BOOK FOR USE BY THE COMMUNITY OF NUNS THAT HELOISE JOINED 
ONLY ONE POEM WITH ITS SETTING HAS SURVIVED FROM THAT WORK 
IT'S A MEDITATION ON THE DISAPPOINTMENTS OF HUMAN LIFE 
IN HEAVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD 
WHEN EVERY DAY IS A SUNDAY AND THERE IS REST FOR THE WEARY 
THERE WILL BE NO SEPARATION BETWEEN A WISH AND ITS FULFILMENT 
ALL PRAYERS WILL BE ANSWERED 
BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE JUST HAVE TO SOLDIER ON 
O. QUANTA QUALIA 
SUNT ILLA SABBATA 
QUAE SEMPER CELEBRAT 
SUPERNA CURIA 
QUAE FESSIS REQUIES 
QUAE MERCES FORTIBUS 
CUM ERIT OMNIA 
DEUS IN OMNIBUS 
THIS IS THE TWELFTH CENTURY BUILT IN STONE 
AND THE DIRECT INSPIRATION FOR NOTRE DAME 
HERE HARRY CHRISTOPHER AND HIS SINGERS 
ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE GOTHIC ACOUSTICS 
TO TRY AND RECREATE THE AUTHENTIC SOUND OF LEONIN'S ORGANUM DUPLUM 
TWO PART POLYPHONY ORGANUM IS THIS IDEA OF THE LONG NOTES 
AND ABOVE IT THIS VERY IMPROVISED LINE DUPLUM 
WHEN WE SANG IN SAINT DENIS IT WAS STAGGERING BECAUSE THE SOUND WENT JUST ALL THE WAY BACK 
LOVELY ACOUSTIC AN EVEN SOUND ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
WHAT I CALL A BEAUTIFUL TAIL TO THE END OF THE SOUND 
THE FIRST THING THAT STRUCK ME WAS THE VERY POWERFUL ACOUSTIC 
IT WAS VERY CLEAN AND YET A NICE REVERBERATION 
YOU REALLY FELT AS A SINGER 
THAT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING TO RECEIVE THAT SORT OF MUSIC 
WHEN WE FINISHED A LONG HELD CHORD 
IT CAME BACK ABSOLUTELY IN TUNE WHICH IS VERY GRATIFYING INDEED 
AND NOT ALWAYS THE CASE I'D SAY 
OMNES 
THESE EARLY TWO PART COMPOSITIONS ARE MILESTONES IN THE HISTORY OF WESTERN MUSIC 
SOME OF THE FIRST KNOWN PIECES FOR TWO INDEPENDENT PARTS 
AND CRUCIALLY THEY WERE WRITTEN DOWN 
HELEN DEEMING IS AN EXPERT IN MEDIAEVAL POLYPHONY 
WITH A SPECIAL INTEREST IN THE GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF MUSICAL SOUNDS 
PEOPLE HAD EXPERIMENTED WITH THE IDEA YOU COULD DRAW HORIZONTAL LINES 
TO CONNECT NOTES OF THE SAME PITCH 
THE VERY FIRST MUSICAL NOTATION WAS LITTLE MARKS ABOVE A TEXT 
THE IDEA OF IT WAS TO REMIND YOU OF A TUNE THAT YOU ALREADY KNEW 
GRADUALLY PEOPLE REALISED THAT YOU COULD PLACE THE MARKS HIGHER UP 
OR LOWER DOWN THE PAGE 
THE REAL INNOVATION WAS THE IDEA OF HAVING HORIZONTAL LINES 
THAT WOULD CONNECT ALL OF THE NOTES OF THE SAME PITCH 
IT ENABLES MUSIC TO MOVE AROUND 
MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND FREELY THAN IT HAD BEEN ABLE TO BEFORE 
NOW IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SIGHT READ 
TO READ IT FORM THE PAGE AND MAKE THE MUSICAL SOUNDS 
IT MUST HAVE HAD A MASSIVE EFFECT ON THE PRACTITIONERS 
VERY MUCH SO I THINK IT'S A REVOLUTION IN MUSIC WRITING 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STAVE 
MARKS THAT SYMBOLISE NOTES 
FIXED ON A SET OF LINES PLACED ONE ABOVE THE OTHER 
LEARN TO WRITE WITH THE SYSTEM AND YOU CAN COPY OR COMPOSE A COMPLEX NEW MUSIC 
LEARN TO READ WITH THIS SYSTEM AND YOU CAN SPEEDILY LEARN 
A NEW REPERTOIRE 
RULES WERE A MEDIAEVAL OBSESSION 
ENDLESS ACADEMIC ENERGY WAS SPENT SEEKING TO PERFECT 
AN EXPLANATION OF HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS 
FUSING THE OLD AND THE NEW TESTAMENTS WITH GREEK PHILOSOPHY 
SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS SCHOLARS FORMULATED UNIVERSAL LAWS 
AND MUSIC WAS A KEY PLAYER 
NEARLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS EARLIER 
THE PHILOSOPHER PYTHAGORAS HAD DISCOVERED CORRESPONDENCES 
BETWEEN THE MUSICAL NOTES THAT HE HEARD AS HARMONIOUS 
AND THE MATHEMATICAL INTERVALS HE COULD MEASURE BETWEEN THEM 
THE SCIENTIFIC LAWS BEHIND THIS HE DECLARED 
MUST BE THE SAME AS THOSE THAT GOVERN THE MOTIONS OF THE STARS AND PLANETS 
MEDIAEVAL SCHOLARS SEIZED ON THIS IDEA OF HARMONIC PURITY 
AND TRIED TO PRODUCE A SET OF RULES THAT WOULD WORK FOR MUSIC 
AND THAT FITTED INTO THE GREATER PHILOSOPHICAL SCHEME OF THINGS 
EVERY THEORIST TALKS TECHNICALLY 
THEY TALK ENDLESSLY ABOUT DETAILS OF NOTATION 
WHICH IS CODIFIED IN THIS FANTASTIC SCHOLASTIC WAY 
SO EVERYTHING HAS A STRUCTURE EVERYTHING HAS GOT A PLACE 
IN WHICH IT FITS 
WE ACTUALLY HAVE CURRICULA FOR MUSIC FROM THE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTIES 
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'D EXPECT 
IT'S MORE AKIN TO PHYSICS THAN WHAT WE MIGHT UNDERSTAND AS MUSIC 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THEORY 
ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF MUSIC IS THAT YOU CAN EASILY PUT THEORY INTO PRACTICE 
THIS IS A WORKSHOP IN ESSEX THAT BELONGS TO NICK 
HE'S A GUITAR MAKER 
HE'S GOING TO SHOW ME HOW TO MAKE A VERY SIMPLE INSTRUMENT 
THE MONOCHORD 
I'M COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT HE'S GOING TO LEAD ME THROUGH 
NICK LET'S START THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE INSTRUMENT 
COMPARED TO GUITAR MAKING 
WE START OFF WITH FOUR IDENTICAL SIZED PIECES OF WOOD 
WE HAVE FOUR CORNER PIECES 
WHICH I'M GOING TO GET YOU TO GLUE ON 
THERE'S YOUR BLOCK OF WOOD 
YOU JUST NEED A VERY THIN BEAD OF GLUE 
JUST A SQUIDDLE WE CALL IT IN THE TRADE 
THEN THIS IS THE MUCKY BIT 
THAT'S FINE 
THE MONOCHORD IS REALLY SIMPLE TO BUILD 
WHAT IT DOES IS QUITE CLEVER 
A DETERMINATION TO DEMONSTRATE THAT PYTHAGORAS' RULES CAN BE APPLIED TO WESTERN CHURCH MUSIC 
INSPIRED THE THEORISTS TO TRY TO MEASURE PRECISELY THE FRACTIONS OF NOTES WITHIN AN OCTAVE 
O. K. SO THAT'S STUCK WE LEAVE THAT TO DRY 
I THINK IF WE'RE VERY CAREFUL WE CAN PROBABLY PUT THE BASE ON 
THEY DISCOVERED THAT TWO INTERVALS THE FOURTH AND THE FIFTH 
PRODUCED A SATISFACTORY RESONANCE A HARMONY 
JUST AS PYTHAGORAS' PURE MATHS HAD PREDICTED 
WITH THIS INSTRUMENT THE MONOCHORD 
THESE MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIPS COULD BE BOTH MEASURED AND DEMONSTRATED 
THERE WE GO NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE ONE END A TAILPIECE 
AND AT THE OTHER END WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GUITAR MACHINE HEAD 
YOU'RE IN 
THE MONOCHORD IS SIMPLY A BOX WITH A SINGLE STRING 
WHEN YOU PLUCK THIS STRING IT WILL VIBRATE AT A SPECIFIC FREQUENCY 
AND THAT PRODUCES A NOTE 
IF YOU HALVE ITS LENGTH THE PLUCKED STRING WILL VIBRATE AT TWICE THE FREQUENCY OF THE ORIGINAL 
AND THE NOTE WILL BE AN OCTAVE HIGHER 
CAN I DO IT IT'S GOING TO BE A DISASTER PLEASE DO 
ONE THAT SIDE 
THERE'S THE OCTAVE 
USING THIS LITTLE SLIDING BRIDGE 
YOU CAN SUBDIVIDE IT ENDLESSLY 
LIKE MAGIC YOU CAN CALCULATE AND BOTH SEE AND HEAR THE DIFFERENT HARMONIC INTERVALS 
AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS 
YOU GET THE SENSE THIS IS PYTHAGORAS THE PERFECT INTERVALS GREEK PHILOSOPHY 
BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY A COMPLETELY PRACTICAL INSTRUMENT YEAH 
THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE HEARING IT IN THE FLESH SO TO SPEAK 
YOU CAN HEAR A THEORY BEING PUT INTO PRACTICE 
HERE I AM PROUDLY GOING OFF WITH MY OWN MONOCHORD 
I'VE LEARNT A LOT ABOUT IT AS WELL I THINK YOU NEED A GIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
RIGHT THIS IS WHERE MATHS MEETS MUSIC 
MARK THIS IS THE STRING DIVIDED TWO TO ONE SO IT SHOULD BE AN OCTAVE 
SHOULD BE WE HOPE 
WOULD YOU SING THAT PLEASE MARK AH H. H. 
HIGHER NOTE AH H. H. 
IT'S A PERFECT OCTAVE WE THINK THAT'S ABOUT A C. 
ROUND ABOUT A C. 
THE SECOND INTERVAL IS A FIFTH 
SO WE HAVE THIS THE LOWER NOTE 
AH H. H. 
ABOUT A D. AND THEN THIS SHOULD BE ACTUALLY YOU SING IT FIRST 
HIGHER NOTE AH H. H. 
SAME NOTE MAGIC THAT'S A FIFTH 
SO THAT'S AN A AND THIS SHOULD BE A FOURTH 
SO 
AH H. H. 
HIGHER NOTE AH H. H. 
SAME NOTE 
THAT'S THE PRINCIPLES PYTHAGOREAN PRINCIPLES 
THIS IS SCIENCE AND MUSIC WORKING TOGETHER AT THE BIRTH OF HARMONY 
LEONIN AND THE NOTRE DAME SINGERS DISCOVERED THAT THE NOTES WHICH SOUNDED RIGHT WHEN SUNG TOGETHER 
CORRESPONDED TO THE IDEAS ABOUT HARMONIC PURITY DEVELOPED BY THE THEORITICIANS 
AND DEMONSTRATED BY THE MONOCORD 
HARRY I SPENT A LONG AND ENTERTAINING MORNING 
BUILDING THIS WHICH IS MY MONOCHORD 
I'M VERY PROUD OF IT WHAT PRECISELY WAS IT USED FOR 
IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE THANK YOU VERY IMPRESSIVE INDEED 
IT WAS USED QUITE SIMPLY TO GIVE THE NOTE UH HUH 
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO TEACH YOUNG MUSICIANS WHAT INTERVALS WERE 
AND PARTICULARLY THE FOURTH AND THE FIFTH 
WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND RECONSTRUCT THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF ORGANUM IS THAT RIGHT 
YES I MEAN ORGANUM IS BASED ON THE CHANT 
YEAH SO WE'VE GOT THAT WONDERFUL CHANT HEC DIES FOR EASTER DAY 
RIGHT AND THEY'LL SING THE CHANT FIRST OF ALL VERY SIMPLY 
HEC 
DIES 
NOW ON VERY HIGH FEAST DAYS SPECIAL OCCASIONS 
THIS COULD WELL HAVE BEEN SUNG AT THE OCTAVE LIKE THIS 
HEC 
DIES 
SO THAT'S THE OTHER LINE SINGING AN OCTAVE BELOW 
AND IT GIVES IT A BIT MORE WEIGHT AND 
YEAH AND YOU GET A FEELING OF A REAL FESTIVE OCCASION 
SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING WE THINK THEY EVER DID 
WAS TO ADD AN OCTAVE TO GIVE IT A BIT OF BALLAST ABSOLUTELY 
AND THEN WHAT WAS THE NEXT STAGE 
WELL THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS IS THE INTERVAL OF THE FIFTH 
THIS SHOULD BE A FIFTH 
A BIT CHINESE 
HIGHER NOTE SO WE SING THE CHANT LIKE THIS 
WITH FIFTH INTERVAL ADDED HEC 
DIES 
THAT TO ME SOUNDS LIKE A RATHER HOLLOW 
SINISTER SOUND IT'S A VERY HOLLOW SOUND IT IS ABSOLUTELY HOLLOW 
AND SORT OF SUITS THE ARCHES OF THIS CHURCH 
BUT THEN WE HAVE SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AND WE HEAR THE INTERVAL OF A FOURTH A LITTLE LOWER 
WITH FOURTH INTERVAL ADDED HEC 
HEAR THAT CHANT NOW 
HEC 
SO HERE'S THE RANGE OF NOTES THAT WILL HARMONISE 
WHEN LEONIN REMODELS THE PLAINSONG AS POLYPHONY WITH THE LONG DRONE NOTES 
AND ELABORATE SECOND VOICE 
THOSE THREE INTERVALS ARE THE THREE BASIC INTERVALS THAT WE GET FROM PYTHAGOREAN THEORY 
AND THEORISTS AT THIS TIME WERE WRITING ABOUT THOSE INTERVALS AND SAYING THESE ARE THE 
THE PURE THE PERFECT INTERVALS 
IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT HEC DIES HEARD ON EASTER DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE SAME EFFECT AS STRAVINSKY'S RITE OF SPRING FOR ITS AUDIENCE 
SOME PEOPLE MUST HAVE HATED IT OTHERS THOUGHT WOW WHAT IS THIS FANTASTIC MUSIC 
THESE TUNES ESPECIALLY THOSE FOR THE GREAT FEAST DAYS WOULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO EVERYONE IN A CHURCH 
THE CONGREGATION IN THE NAVE JUST AS MUCH AS THE CHOIR IN THE STALLS 
BUT WHO WAS THIS MUSIC BEING SUNG FOR 
IT WAS OF COURSE BEING DIRECTED UP TO HEAVEN 
THE ULTIMATE THE FINAL AUDIENCE FOR THIS MUSIC WAS GOD 
THE MUSIC SOARS UP TO GOD AND HIS SAINTS AND HIS ANGELS 
IT ALSO SELF CONSCIOUSLY ASPIRES TO PERFECTION THE PERFECTION OF HEAVEN 
PURE BUT COMPLEX 
THE VOICES INDEPENDENT BUT ACCURATELY POSITIONED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER 
AN INTELLECTUAL EXERCISE GOVERNED BY MATHEMATICAL PATTERNS 
BUT WITH A MYSTICAL SPIRITUAL INTENTION 
THE DESIGN AND COMPLEXITY OF THE MUSIC 
REFLECTING THE INCREASINGLY FLAMBOYANT STYLE OF THE ARCHITECTURE 
THE FLYING BUTTRESSES THE POINTED WINDOWS 
THE TRACERY THE STATUARY THE VASTLY AMBITIOUS 
STAINED GLASS THIS IS THE REAL GOTHIC 
SO THIS IS THE SAINTE CHAPELLE 
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY 
WHO BUILT IT AND WHY 
IT WAS BUILT BY LOUIS THE NINTH THIS WAS GOING TO HOUSE THE RELICS OF THE PASSION 
AND ESPECIALLY THE CROWN OF THORNS AND THAT WAS GOING TO MAKE IT 
THE CENTREPIECE OF WESTERN CHRISTIANITY SO AGAIN 
IT WAS A BIG RELIGIOUS STATEMENT AND IT WAS A BIG POLITICAL STATEMENT LIKE NOTRE DAME 
LIKE NOTRE DAME BUT WHAT WAS MOST INCREDIBLE ABOUT THIS CHAPEL 
IS REALLY THE ARCHITECTURE YOU'VE GOT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY 
AND SOME PEOPLE DESCRIBE IT AS THE TRIUMPH OF THE INTANGIBLE 
IF YOU LOOK AROUND YOU THIS IS LIKE A WINDOW ON HEAVEN 
IT'S PSYCHEDELIC IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S TRIPPY IT'S VISIONARY 
AND THIS INCREDIBLE TRANSCENDENTAL BEAUTY AS WELL IN SOME WAYS 
THE APOGEE OF WESTERN CHRISTIAN ART 
THERE'S SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THIS AS WELL WHICH IS TO DO WITH THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY AND THE MATERIAL 
MELTED INTO THE INTANGIBLE INTO THE IMPOSSIBLE 
WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS IMPOSSIBLE 
AND REMEMBER TO THE MEDIEVAL MIND THIS IS A MIND BLOWING EXPERIENCE 
EVERYTHING HERE IS A MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE SPACE 
OF THE BEYOND AND THE DIVINE 
FOR THEM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PICTURE OF HEAVEN 
IT LOOKS LIKE HEAVEN LIKE THE VERY HEAVENS THEMSELVES 
AND I FIND IT MIND BLOWING LOOKING AT IT NOW 
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE MEANT TO THE MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION 
EVERY SINGLE FEATURE OF THESE EXTRAORDINARY BUILDINGS 
WAS DESIGNED TO CONVEY THIS DIZZYING THEOLOGICAL MESSAGE 
THEIR ELEGANT GEOMETRY REFLECTING THE CONCEPT OF GOD'S ORDERED AND HARMONIOUS UNIVERSE 
THE NEW POLYPHONY WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS 
AS VIBRANT AND RICHLY TEXTURED AS THE STAINED GLASS AND STONEWORK 
SO ALONG WITH GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE THIS MUSIC SPREAD THROUGHOUT NORTHERN FRANCE 
AND THEN VERY QUICKLY THROUGHOUT MEDIEVAL CHRISTENDOM 
PARIS HAD BECOME THE PRE EMINENT CITY IN WESTERN EUROPE 
IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY THE CITY ITSELF WAS EXPANDING 
AS A CENTRE FOR LEARNING IN TERMS OF THE SCHOOLS WHICH WOULD BECOME THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS 
IT WAS ALSO A GREAT CENTRE FOR TRADE BECAUSE OF THE RIVER SEINE 
THERE ARE PEOPLE COMING INTO PARIS FROM ALL ACROSS EUROPE 
SO THEY'RE GOING TO NOTRE DAME AND HEARING THIS MUSIC AND SEEING THIS FABULOUS NEW BUILDING 
SO ANYBODY WITH AN INTEREST IN MUSIC RECOGNISES THIS 
AS SOMETHING QUITE MIND BLOWING AND IS RAPIDLY PICKING UP MANUSCRIPTS OF IT 
AND TAKING WHAT THEY FIND THERE BACK TO THEIR HOME COUNTRIES 
SO PRESUMABLY SOME PEOPLE SAID OH YOU MUST HEAR THE NEW LEONIN IT'S FANTASTIC ABSOLUTELY 
IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SEND THE BOOK TO ANOTHER PLACE 
AND FOR SOME OTHER SINGER TO READ IT FROM THE PAGE AND MAKE THE MUSICAL SOUNDS 
WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE ANOTHER SINGER COME WITH HIM TO TEACH HIM THE TUNE 
THIS IS THE FLOWERING OF THE MIDDLE AGES 
FROM THE END OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY WHEN LEONIN FLOURISHED UNTIL THE RENAISSANCE TWO CENTURIES LATER 
THE STARTLING NEW HARMONIES OF THE NOTRE DAME SCHOOL WOULD NOW BE HEARD EVERYWHERE 
NOT JUST IN THE NEW GOTHIC CATHEDRALS BUT IN MONASTERIES 
ARISTOCRATIC CHAPELS AND EVERY CHURCH THAT COULD OBTAIN A SET OF MUSIC MANUSCRIPTS 
AND SOME SINGERS WHO COULD READ THEM 
ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO ONE DOCUMENT WE COULD CALL THE MAGNUS LIBER 
THERE ARE ABOUT HALF A DOZEN SURVIVING NOTRE DAME MANUSCRIPTS 
SCATTERED ACROSS EUROPE EVIDENCE OF HOW EFFICIENTLY POLYPHONY WAS NOW BEING EXPORTED 
IN THE HERZOG AUGUST LIBRARY IN WOLFENBUTTEL NORTHERN GERMANY 
I DISCOVERED TWO OF THE BEST PRESERVED EXAMPLES' 
THESE ARE OUR NOTRE DAME MANUSCRIPTS 
THE BINDING IS MODERN BUT THE CONTENT IS THE ORIGINAL PARCHMENT AND SCRIPT 
PROBABLY OF THE MIDDLE OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY 
IN THIS TIME PARCHMENT WAS THE ONLY MATERIAL 
TO WRITE BOOKS PAPER WAS NOT YET KNOWN IN WESTERN EUROPE 
AND SO PARCHMENT MADE FROM SHEEP GEESE OR MAINLY CALVES 
IT'S VERY SIMPLE ISN'T IT 
IT'S A WORKING HANDBOOK YES 
NOTHING ORNAMENTAL ABOUT IT AND PRESUMABLY IT WAS MUCH USED 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HANDLED BY GENERATIONS OF SINGERS 
IT ARRIVED IN GERMANY AFTER CENTURIES OF USE IN SCOTLAND 
IT'S SLIGHTLY GRUBBY STAINED 
AND PEPPERED WITH SPLASHES OF ANCIENT WAX EXTRAORDINARY 
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MUSIC 
IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A MEDIEVAL SINGER IN A DARKENED GOTHIC CHURCH 
TRYING TO FOLLOW THE NOTES BY THE LIGHT OF A FLICKERING CANDLE 
VIDERUNT OMNES 
YES THAT'S IT WOW 
IT'S FANTASTIC 
THE SECOND OF THE TWO COLLECTIONS LOOKED AND FELT RATHER DIFFERENT 
THIS IS A DIFFERENT WRITER ISN'T IT YES IT'S A DIFFERENT WRITER 
THIS IS SURELY WRITTEN IN FRANCE 
WE DON'T KNOW WHO ORDERED THIS MANUSCRIPT 
PROBABLY IT WAS WRITTEN FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS INTERESTED 
IN A LITTLE BIT MORE BEAUTY AND LUXURY 
AND THEREFORE THESE INITIALS WERE PAINTED WITH COLOURS AND EVEN WITH GOLD 
WHICH WAS A QUITE EXPENSIVE THING 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
THE COPYIST'S WORK IS SO DELICATE AND SO INTRICATE AND YOU CAN SEE 
THE MUSIC ECHOING THE ARCHITECTURE FOR WHICH IT WAS COMPOSED 
WITH SCORES LIKE THESE BEING COPIED AND CIRCULATED 
FRENCH POLYPHONY BEGAN ITS INEVITABLE TAKEOVER OF EUROPE 
CHANGING FUNDAMENTALLY THE WAY CHOIRMASTERS SINGERS AND CONGREGATIONS 
THOUGHT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUSIC AND DIVINE WORSHIP 
ALL THE KEY FACTORS THAT POWERED THE GOTHIC REVOLUTION 
WERE NOW IN PLACE 
A NEW METHOD OF WRITING DOWN NOTES THE MONOCHORD 
NEW ACOUSTIC SPACES CREATED BY THE GOTHIC STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE 
EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER TO PROVIDE THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
IN WHICH POLYPHONIC MUSIC CAN FLOURISH 
LEONIN'S IS NOT THE ONLY NAME THAT HAS SURVIVED FROM THE NOTRE DAME SCHOOL OF COMPOSERS 
WE ALSO KNOW THAT HIS SUCCESSOR WAS CALLED PEROTIN 
WITHIN A GENERATION PEROTIN HAD COMPILED A NEW EDITION OF LEONIN'S WORK 
ANONYMOUS THE FOURTH DESCRIBES PEROTIN AS A MASTER WHO WROTE THE BEST FOUR PART POLYPHONY 
SEDERUNT PRINCIPES WAS WRITTEN FOR THE FEAST OF SAINT STEPHEN 
THE FIRST CHRISTIAN MARTYR AND CO PATRON OF NOTRE DAME 
JUST AS THE GOTHIC BUILDERS USED FLYING BUTTRESSES AND RIB VAULTS 
TO SUPPORT ALL THIS TRACERY AND STAINED GLASS 
PEROTIN USED LEONIN'S DEVELOPMENT OF DUPLUM ORGANUM 
THE EXTENDED TENOR DRONE AND THE PYTHAGORAS APPROVED NOTE INTERVALS 
TO SUPPORT MORE AND MORE ELABORATE INTERWOVEN VOCAL PARTS 
SO WE'VE ARRIVED NOW AT ONE OF THE BIG BANG MOMENTS OF WESTERN MUSIC 
HOW LONG BEFORE THIS HAPPENED HAD THE CHURCH BEEN SINGING WHAT WE WERE SINGING 
ONLY A MATTER OF ABOUT FIFTY YEARS 
WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE TURN OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
WE HAVE LEONIN WRITING THOSE DUPLUM ORGANUM 
AND THEN PEROTIN COMING ALONG AND REVISING IT 
AND ACTUALLY TURNING IT INTO FOUR PART 
NOW THAT OBVIOUSLY BY NECESSITY HAS TO CHANGE NEEDS DISCIPLINE NEEDS MUCH MORE ORGANISATION 
SO THIS IS VIDERUNT OMNES PEROTIN 
IT'S AGAIN BASED ON A PLAINSONG CHANT 
LET'S SING IT LET'S SING THE OPENING PHRASE 
YOU'RE GOING TO ASK ME TO SING IT AS WELL AREN'T YOU I CERTAINLY AM ON YOUR HEAD BE IT 
I'VE GOT MY MODERN VERSION OF A MONOCHORD 
VIDERUNT OMNES 
GREAT SO THAT'S THE BASIC TUNE 
NOW WHAT DOES HE DO NOW THE SAME AS LEONIN IN THAT WE HAVE THE LONG NOTE VALUES 
SO THE PLAINSONG IS ELONGATED POOR OLD JONATHAN HAS TO DO IT BY HIMSELF 
YOU CAN JOIN ME ON THIS 
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT O. K. 
AND THEN OVER THE TOP OF IT WE HAVE THESE ADDED PARTS 
DUPLUM SECOND PART TRIPLUM THIRD PART QUADRUPLUM FOURTH PART 
IF I WERE TO SING IT WITH YOU AND DESTROY THE BEAUTY OF THE WHOLE THING 
DO WE DO WHAT I WAS TAUGHT AT SCHOOL STAGGERED BREATHING 
YES I BREATHE AND YOU DON'T 
THEN YOU BREATHE AND I DON'T YES THROUGH OSMOSIS WE KNOW WHEN THE OTHER PERSON IS GOING TO 
OR YOU CAN INDICATE THROUGH THE SUBTLE USE OF YOUR LITTLE FINGER OH REALLY ON THE PAGE 
IF I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BREATHE I WON'T SHALL WE HAVE A GO 
VI 
SO WE HAD VARIOUS DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OUR FINGERS WORKED 
THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING THING FOR ME 
I THINK THE THING IS THAT CHORD AT THE BEGINNING THE IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE HAD 
IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT WHEN IT WAS FIRST EVER PERFORMED 
CHRISTMAS DAY IT WAS AN AMAZING MOMENT 
IT STILL SOUNDS VERY RICH EVEN TO MODERN EARS IT DOES YES 
IT'S AN ATHLETIC SING THAT'S THE OTHER THING 
WHEN YOU HEAR THE WHOLE THING 
IT'S A BIG SING 
IT'S AMAZING AS WE GO THROUGH THE PIECE WE'VE GOT GREAT MOMENTS OF REAL DISCORD 
IF WE JUST SING A LITTLE PASSAGE 
IT'S THE MOST FANTASTIC CADENCE ISN'T IT 
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
IT GIVES IS A VERY EARTHY FEEL AS WELL 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT'S SPIRITUAL MUSIC AND SACRED MUSIC 
IT GIVES IT A REAL EARTHY QUALITY THAT WOULD REALLY RING TRUE 
MANY A MODERN COMPOSER WOULD BE PROUD OF THAT MOMENT ABSOLUTELY 
VI 
IT'S NOT HARD TO IMAGINE HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE FELT WHEN THEY FIRST SANG THIS FOUR PART MUSIC 
WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE REALLY 
IT'S GOT AN AMAZING RAWNESS AN AMAZING POWER 
YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE FELT OVERWHELMED BY THAT 
THIS WAS REALLY A NEW DEPARTURE IT WAS A REAL MOMENT IN HISTORY 
VIDERUNT OMNES 
WHAT FOUR PART PEROTIN MUST HAVE SOUNDED LIKE 
TO A CONGREGATION TURNING UP IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
AND HEARING THAT AMAZING TEXTURE THAT CHORDAL FOUR PART RINGING 
DOWN THE NAVE 
AND THEN COMING BACK 
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
THEY ARE NOW EXPERIENCING SOMETHING COMPLETELY NEW 
CONTEMPORARY LISTENERS REACTED WITH THE MEDIEVAL EQUIVALENT OF SHOCK AND AWE 
THE BISHOP OF CHARTRES WHO ATTENDED SERVICES IN NOTRE DAME AT THIS TIME 
GAVE THIS FIRST HAND DESCRIPTION 
THAT WHICH IS MOST TUNEFUL AMONG THE BIRDS CANNOT EQUAL THEM 
HEARING THE SOFT HARMONIES OF THE VARIOUS SINGERS 
SOME TAKING THE HIGH PARTS OTHERS THE LOW 
SOME SINGING IN ADVANCE OTHERS FOLLOWING IN THE REAR 
YOU WOULD THINK YOURSELF LISTENING TO A CONCERT OF SIRENS 
RATHER THAN MEN 
AND WONDER AT THE POWER OF VOICES 
SUCH IS THEIR SKILL IN RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE SCALES 
SO WONDERFUL THE SHORTENING OR MULTIPLYING OF NOTES 
THE REPETITION OR EMPHATIC UTTERANCE OF THE PHRASES 
THE TREBLE AND TRILL NOTES ARE SO MINGLED WITH THE TENOR AND THE BASS 
THAT THE EARS LOSE ALL POWER OF JUDGEMENT 
WHEN THIS IS TAKEN TO EXCESS IT IS MORE FITTING TO EXCITE LUST THAN DEVOTION 
BUT IF IT IS KEPT WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF MODERATION 
IT DRIVES CARE AWAY FROM THE SOUL CONFERS JOY PEACE AND EXULTATION IN GOD 
AND TRANSPORTS THE SOUL TO THE SOCIETY OF ANGELS 
THE NOTRE DAME SCHOOL GAVE THE WESTERN WORLD ITS FIRST TASTE OF DEVELOPED HARMONY 
AND THAT TASTE WOULD LEAD ON TO BACH AS WE SHALL HEAR LATER IN THIS SERIES 
AND ALSO TO THE HARMONIC RICHES OF MOZART BEETHOVEN WAGNER 
AND THE WHOLE RANGE OF POPULAR MUSIC 
VITUS ABIT LITTERA IS A CELEBRATION 
THIS IS THE DAY OF JOY LET US REJOICE SAYS THE TEXT 
OUR GUILT IS FORGIVEN 
AND SURELY YOU CAN HEAR THAT JOY IN THE COMPLEX HYPNOTIC PLAY OF THE FOUR VOICES 
IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF SACRED MUSIC 
MY JOURNEY WILL TAKE ME TO ROME 
TO DISCOVER THE UNACCOMPANIED CHORAL MUSIC 
OF THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE 
AND ITS GREATEST MASTER PALESTRINA 
HIS STORY WILL TAKE US INTO THE HEART OF THE LABYRINTH OF SIXTEENTH CENTURY VATICAN POLITICS 
WHERE POPES WIELD POWER AND AUTHORITY 
AND SINGERS TAKE THE PRAISE OF GOD TO DIZZY NEW HEIGHTS 
VITUS ABIT LITTERA
