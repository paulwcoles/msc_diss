CHARLOTTE OH GOD 
STOP HER 
NOT MUCH OF A MESSAGE 
YOUR LOVING HUSBAND'S A MAN OF FEW WORDS WHAT'S IT SAY 
TO KATE IT'S A BIT BRIEF EVEN BY JOHN'S STANDARDS 
WHAT'S THE OCCASION THERE ISN'T ONE 
I'M LUCKY IF I GET A ROSE AND SOME CHOCOLATES ON VALENTINE'S DAY 
MAYBE YOU'VE GOT A SECRET ADMIRER 
HAS CHARLIE BAILEY CALMED DOWN YET 
YEAH JUST ABOUT WE FOUND A DECENT AMOUNT OF CRACK COCAINE IN HER ROOM 
BUT WILSON HAS COVERED HIS TRACKS I BET HE NEVER TOUCHES THE STUFF 
TAKES NO RISKS AND POCKETS THE PROFITS WE COULD STILL CHARGE HIM 
CHARLIE BAILEY'S ONLY SIXTEEN 
IF SHE ADMITS SHE WAS WORKING FOR WILSON AS A PROSTITUTE AND SELLING DRUGS FOR HIM 
WE'VE GOT HIM FORCING HER TO ENGAGE IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITHOUT CONSENT 
RUNNING A BROTHEL AND SUPPLYING A CLASS AS THAT'S FIFTEEN YEARS 
IF SHE AGREES TO TESTIFY IT'S A BIG IF 
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER GIRLS 
NONE OF THEM HAD ANY DRUGS IN THEIR POSSESSION 
SO IF SHE DOESN'T IMPLICATE WILSON 
HE WALKS AWAY AND SHE GOES DOWN FOR POSSESSION WITH INTENT TO SUPPLY 
IT MIGHT BE AN IDEA TO HAVE KELLY SPEAK TO HER 
SHE MIGHT OPEN UP MORE TO A WOMAN AND KELLY'S SOIT TRAINED GOOD IDEA 
WHEN I SIGNED UP I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE CAR CHASES AND CATCHING CROOKS 
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU BUILDS CHARACTER THEN WHY DON'T YOU DO IT 
BECAUSE MY CHARACTER'S ALREADY BEYOND REPROACH AND MORE IMPORTANTLY I'VE GOT STRIPES 
WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER SHE'S MAKING HER OWN WAY TO THE STATION 
WHY'VE YOU ARRESTED ME AND NOT HIM COS YOU WERE THE ONE THROWING ALL THE PUNCHES NAME 
FIONA GLOVER ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF ASSAULT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING 
SHE ELBOWED A MEMBER OF STAFF IN THE FACE AND BROKE HIS NOSE 
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN TROUBLE WE'RE ALWAYS HAPPY TO BROADEN PEOPLE'S HORIZONS 
WHAT SHALL WE DO FIRST SEARCH PRINTS D. N. A. SWABS 
I WENT THERE TO BRING MY DAUGHTER HOME 
AND ENDED UP STARTING A BRAWL 
SO WOULD YOU IF HE'D DONE TO YOUR DAUGHTER WHAT HE'D DONE TO MINE 
HE RAPED HER HE RAPED MY DAUGHTER 
DID SHE TELL YOU THAT NO OF COURSE NOT SHE'D NEVER SAY A WORD AGAINST HIM SHE'S BRAINWASHED 
SHE THINKS THE SUN SHINES OUT OF HIS BACKSIDE 
HOW DO YOU KNOW IF SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING 
I READ HER DIARY I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE 
I WAS DESPERATE 
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP ME FIND OUT WHERE SHE'D GONE 
ALL I FOUND OUT WAS STUFF ABOUT HER HAVING SEX WITH HIM 
SHE WASN'T SURE ABOUT IT FELT THAT SHE HAD TO OTHERWISE HE'D DUMP HER 
UNLESS JESSICA MAKES A FORMAL COMPLAINT THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO 
WAS IT JUST THE ONCE WHAT 
THAT SHE WROTE ABOUT HAVING SEX WITH KIERON 
THEY'VE BEEN SLEEPING TOGETHER FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS 
AND HE RAPED HER EVERY TIME DID HE 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE 
HE'S OLDER THAN SHE IS AND SHE'S IMPRESSIONABLE 
MRS. GLOVER THIS IS A FAMILY MATTER IT ISN'T SOMETHING WE CAN DEAL WITH HERE 
BUT ASSAULTING A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC IS 
BUT SHE'S MY DAUGHTER I KNOW 
BUT THE MORE YOU TRY TO CONTROL JESSICA THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO PUSH HER AWAY 
MRS. GLOVER I'LL HAVE A WORD WITH THE BLOKE AT THE POOL CENTRE O. K. 
I'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION BUT IF HE WANTS TO PRESS CHARGES WE HAVE TO CHARGE YOU WITH ASSAULT 
HI CHARLIE I'VE BROUGHT YOU SOME CLOTHES
