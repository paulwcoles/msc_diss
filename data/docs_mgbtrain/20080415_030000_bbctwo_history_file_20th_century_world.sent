IT IS AUGUST NINETEEN FOURTEEN 
A GLORIOUS SUMMER IN A BRITAIN WHERE EVERYONE STILL WEARS HATS 
WHERE HORSES ARE MORE COMMON ON THE STREETS THAN CARS 
WHERE CINEMA IS SILENT AND A FAMILY PHOTOGRAPH A SPECIAL OCCASION 
THIS IS THE ELLIS FAMILY 
WILLIAM ELLIS A WEALTHY SHIP OWNER IN CARDIFF 
HIS WIFE CONSTANCE THEIR CHILDREN CHARLOTTE AND ALFRED 
BY THE TIME THEIR FAMILY PORTRAIT IS PRINTED 
A DEVASTATING WAR WILL HAVE BROKEN OUT IN EUROPE 
CHANGING THEIR LIVES AND BRITAIN FOR EVER 
LA A AND OF HOPE AND GLORY 
BEFORE THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
MANY PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT BRITAIN WAS REALLY THE WEALTHIEST MOST SUCCESSFUL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD 
BRITAIN CONTROLLED THE SEAS 
THE NAVIES OF OTHER WORLD POWERS WERE DWARFED BY THE BRITISH 
A QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION LIVED UNDER BRITISH EMPIRE RULE BRITAIN DOMINATED WORLD TRADE 
ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES WAS COAL 
COAL KEPT THE WORLD TURNING 
IT KEPT HOUSES WARM POWERED FACTORIES TRAINS AND SHIPS 
THE COAL MINES OF SOUTH WALES SENT MILLIONS OF TONS OF COAL TO CARDIFF DOCKS 
WHICH EXPORTED MORE COAL AROUND THE WORLD THAN ANY OTHER PORT IN EUROPE 
AS THIS NINETEEN OH NINE CARTOON SAYS 
SHIP OWNERS LIKE WILLIAM ELLIS REAPED THE REWARDS 
THEY WERE RICH MEN IN A RICH COUNTRY 
BUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE WEALTH WAS HIGHLY UNEQUAL 
THE ANNUAL CARDIFF SHIP OWNERS PHOTOGRAPH REEKS OF WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE 
THE PHOTOGRAPH OF STRIKING MINERS IN NINETEEN TWELVE HOWEVER REVEALS THE HARDSHIP OF LIFE 
RUMMAGING FOR SCRAPS OF COAL TO KEEP THEIR FAMILIES WARM IN WINTER 
BRITAIN WAS DIVIDED BY A CLASS SYSTEM 
AT THE TOP OF THE PILE WERE THE WEALTHY UPPER CLASS 
THEN CAME THE MIDDLE CLASS DOCTORS LAWYERS AND SHOPKEEPERS 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE WAS THE WORKING CLASS MINERS SERVANTS MANUAL WORKERS 
EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION THEY OWNED VIRTUALLY NOTHING 
THIS WAS A MAN'S WORLD 
WHERE YOUR WEALTH EDUCATION JOB ACCENT AND EVEN YOUR NAME 
TIED YOU INTO ONE LIFE OR ANOTHER 
WRITER GEORGE ORWELL WAS BROUGHT UP IN A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY 
WE WERE TOLD THE LOWER CLASSES SMELL 
AND EVEN LOWER CLASS PEOPLE WHOM YOU KNEW TO BE QUITE CLEAN 
LIKE SERVANTS WERE UNAPPETISING 
THE SMELL OF THEIR SWEAT THE TEXTURE OF THEIR SKINS 
WERE MYSTERIOUSLY DIFFERENT FROM OURS 
PEOPLE LIKE THE ELLISES EMPLOYED LOWER CLASS PEOPLE 
TO COOK CLEAN AND LOOK AFTER THEM 
MRS. ELLIS DOES NOT WORK SHE IS A LADY OF LEISURE 
UPSTAIRS IS ONE WORLD DOWNSTAIRS ANOTHER 
TWO MILLION SERVANTS TOILED IN BRITISH HOUSES AT THIS TIME 
THE WORK WAS HARD AND THE PAY LOW 
TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD I. WAN JONES HAS BEEN TAUGHT A SKILL 
UNLIKE MR. ELLIS HE CAN DRIVE THE NEW FAMILY AUTOMOBILE 
FOR WHICH HE IS PAID NINETEEN A YEAR 
HIS COAL MINING FAMILY THINK THAT HE HAS LANDED A GOOD JOB 
COMPARED TO WORKING IN THE PITS 
DOMESTIC SERVICE IS SAFE AND AS LONG AS HE KNOWS HIS PLACE SECURE 
MARY DAVIES THE HOUSEMAID 
HAS TO GET UP AT FIVE A M. EVERY DAY TO LIGHT THE FIRES 
SHE DOES MOST OF THE MORE MENIAL TASKS 
SCRUBBING WASHING POLISHING 
AND MUST BE POLITE AT ALL TIMES 
FOR THIS SHE GETS TWELVE A YEAR PLUS FOOD CLOTHING AND HER OWN ROOM 
AT ANY HOUR OF THE DAY 
ONE OF THE ELLISES MAY RING FOR HER 
UPSTAIRS CHARLOTTE ELLIS IS GETTING DRESSED 
AN OPERATION COMPLEX ENOUGH TO REQUIRE MARY'S HELP 
CHARLOTTE IS NOT EXPECTED TO WORK 
OR CONCERN HERSELF WITH FINANCE OR POLITICS 
EVEN PRIVILEGED WOMEN AT THIS TIME DID NOT HAVE THE VOTE 
CHARLOTTE'S LIFE IS GOVERNED BY A SET OF RULES KNOWN AS ETIQUETTE 
WHOLE BOOKS WERE WRITTEN 
SETTING OUT THE BEHAVIOUR APPROPRIATE TO EVERY SITUATION 
HOW TO HITCH UP YOUR SKIRTS WITHOUT MAKING THIS SPECTACLE OF YOURSELF 
OR MAKING SURE SHE IS ALWAYS CHAPERONED 
SO THAT NO LIAISONS DEVELOP WITH UNSUITABLE YOUNG MEN 
SCANDAL OF THAT KIND COULD TARNISH HER REPUTATION IN SOCIETY 
IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE HOWEVER 
TO IMAGINE THAT EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY WITH THEIR WAY OF LIFE 
SOME WOMEN CAMPAIGNED FOR THE VOTE 
ONE GROUP KNOWN AS SUFFRAGETTES 
HAD BEGUN A DETERMINED AND OFTEN VIOLENT CAMPAIGN 
THE TRADES UNION MOVEMENT WAS GROWING IN POWER 
IN CRUCIAL INDUSTRIES LIKE COAL AND SHIPPING 
BUT ON THE FOURTH AUGUST NINETEEN FOURTEEN WAR WAS DECLARED 
IMPOSING A NEW SET OF PRIORITIES ON EVERYONE 
OH OH OH IT'S A LOVELY WAR 
WHO WOULDN'T BE A SOLDIER EH ALMOST ASHAMED TO TAKE THE PAY 
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THERE WAS WILD ENTHUSIASM FOR THE GREAT ADVENTURE 
HOW CAN WE SPEND THE MONEY WE EARN OH OH OH IT'S A LOVELY WAR 
RECRUITING STATIONS WERE SWAMPED WITH VOLUNTEERS 
OH OH OH IT'S A LOVELY WAR 
NONE OF THOSE CARDIFF VOLUNTEERS WOULD HAVE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT THE REALITIES OF WAR 
WAR WAS THOUGHT TO BE A GLORIOUS AFFAIR THAT THE BRITISH USUALLY WON 
CAUGHT UP IN THE GENERAL ENTHUSIASM 
ALFRED ELLIS WRAPS UP HIS AFFAIRS IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS 
AND JOINS THE THIRTY EIGHTH WELSH DIVISION 
HIS PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION MEANS HE AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES AN OFFICER 
IN CONTRAST I. WAN THE FAMILY CHAUFFEUR 
JOINS UP AS A PRIVATE SOLDIER 
OH OH OH IT'S A LOVELY WAR 
EVERYONE IMAGINED A QUICK HEROIC WAR THEN HOME FOR CHRISTMAS 
HOW CAN WE SPEND THE MONEY WE EARN 
OH OH OH IT'S A LOVELY WAR 
THIS CONFLICT FAR FROM BEING SHORT AND HEROIC 
TURNS OUT TO BE LONG AND BRUTAL 
SLAUGHTER ON THIS SCALE HAD NEVER BEEN DREAMED OF 
WAR BACKED BY INDUSTRIAL POWER 
MACHINE GUNS TANKS SUBMARINES AND AEROPLANES WERE THE NEW WAR WEAPONS 
CHURNED OUT ON THE FACTORY FLOORS ACROSS EUROPE 
THE FIGHTING CREATED A HUGE DEMAND FOR SUPPLIES 
AND AT THE SAME TIME A SHORTAGE OF WORKERS BACK HOME 
THIS HAD TWO FAR REACHING EFFECTS 
FIRSTLY IT PUT THE TRADE UNIONS IN A STRONGER POSITION THAN BEFORE 
WHEN STRIKES BROKE OUT IN ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIES DURING THE WAR 
AND THEY DID FREQUENTLY 
GOVERNMENT AND EMPLOYERS OFTEN HAD TO GIVE IN 
SECONDLY THE SHORTAGE OF MEN IN THE FACTORIES 
MEANT THAT THERE WAS NO CHOICE BUT TO EMPLOY WOMEN 
IN THIS PROPAGANDA FILM 
THE FIGURE OF BRITANNIA URGES WOMEN TO WORK FOR VICTORY 
FOR MANY WOMEN IT WAS THEIR FIRST CHANCE TO ESCAPE THEIR RESTRICTED LIVES AND THEY LEAPT AT IT 
THEY JOINED THE LAND ARMY 
WENT TO THE FRONT AS NURSES 
AND TOOK ON JOBS WHICH BEFORE HAD ONLY BEEN DONE BY MEN 
IT GAVE THEM A NEW SELF ESTEEM 
AND THE MONEY MEANT INDEPENDENCE FROM THE FATHERS AND HUSBANDS WHO'D RULED THEIR LIVES 
CHARLOTTE JOINS THE VOLUNTARY AID DETACHMENT 
AND FINDS HERSELF TENDING SOLDIERS ON THE FRONT LINE 
THE CARNAGE OF WAR IS APPALLING 
IN THE FACE OF WHAT SHE SEES HERE 
MUCH OF WHAT SHE THOUGHT IMPORTANT LIKE ETIQUETTE SEEMS MEANINGLESS 
THE WAR HAD A HUGE APPETITE GOBBLING UP LIVES AND SUPPLIES 
MARY LEAVES HER HOUSEMAID'S JOB AND BECOMES A MUNITIONS WORKER 
HERE SHE EARNS FAR MORE THAN THE ELLISES HAD EVER PAID HER 
CONDITIONS FOR FACTORY WORKERS IMPROVED DURING THE WAR 
HIGH OUTPUT DEPENDED ON GOOD HEALTH 
AND SO MEDICAL CHECKS WERE PROVIDED CANTEENS BUILT 
AND EVEN CRECHES SET UP TO LOOK AFTER WORKERS' CHILDREN 
FOR THE ELLIS SHIPPING COMPANY THE WAR IS GREAT BUSINESS 
MERCHANT SHIPS ARE CRUCIAL TO SUPPLY THE WAR EFFORT IN FRANCE 
AND ANY THAT ARE SUNK ARE REPLACED BY THE GOVERNMENT 
ON SIXTH NOVEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
A TELEGRAM ARRIVES AT THE ELLIS HOUSEHOLD 
CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY A SMALL BOX CONTAINING 
ONE POSTCARD ONE PIPE ONE BIBLE 
ONE WRIST WATCH 
ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF THEIR SON ALFRED 
THE ADVENTURE THAT WAS TO BE OVER BY CHRISTMAS 
HAD DRAGGED ON FOR FOUR YEARS CLAIMING NINE MILLION LIVES 
EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEM BRITISH 
A LARGE SWATHE OF THE COUNTRY'S YOUNG MEN HAD SIMPLY DISAPPEARED 
BEFORE THE WAR THIS AMATEUR FOOTBALL TEAM IN CARDIFF WAS MADE UP OF TWENTY YEAR OLDS 
AFTER THE FEW SURVIVORS HAD TO BE AUGMENTED BY OLD MEN 
OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED 
A QUARTER OF A MILLION CAME BACK PERMANENTLY MAIMED 
AND FOR MANY A RETURN TO NORMAL LIFE WAS IMPOSSIBLE 
I. WAN THE FAMILY CHAUFFEUR SURVIVES THE WAR 
BUT RETURNS WITHOUT HIS RIGHT LEG 
HE IS HOSPITALISED AT THE PRINCE OF WALES HOSPITAL IN CARDIFF 
HE HAS FOUGHT THROUGH A NEW TYPE OF WAR THAT NO ONE 
NOT EVEN THE GENERALS HAD KNOWN HOW TO FIGHT 
HE NOW HAS A BITTER DISTRUST OF THE UPPER CLASSES I. WAN COULD NOW NEVER GO BACK TO DOMESTIC SERVICE 
RETURNING SOLDIERS WERE PROMISED A LAND FIT FOR HEROES TO LIVE IN 
BUT THIS POST WAR OPTIMISM SOON DISAPPEARED 
AS BRITAIN WAS HIT BY AN ECONOMIC SLUMP 
WHEREAS DURING THE WAR EVERYONE HAD A JOB BY NINETEEN TWENTY ONE FOURTEEN MILLION WERE JOBLESS 
MARY THE HOUSEMAID FINDS HER LIBERATION SHORT LIVED 
THE RETURNING SOLDIERS TAKE WHAT JOBS ARE AVAILABLE A WOMAN'S PLACE IS ONCE MORE IN THE HOME 
SHE HAS NO OPTION BUT TO RETURN TO SERVICE IN THE ELLIS HOUSEHOLD 
FOR EDUCATED WOMEN HOWEVER THERE WERE NOW MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOBS AND INDEPENDENCE 
MANY MEN WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN AGAINST THE VOTE FOR WOMEN NOW CHANGED THEIR MINDS 
J. L. GARVIN EDITOR OF THE OBSERVER NEWSPAPER WROTE IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN 
TIME WAS WHEN I THOUGHT MEN ALONE MAINTAINED THE STATE NOW I KNOW 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN WOMEN OVER THIRTY WHO OWNED PROPERTY WERE ALLOWED TO VOTE 
A YEAR LATER NANCY ASTOR ENTERED PARLIAMENT AS BRITAIN'S FIRST WOMAN M. P. IT WAS A START 
THE THINGS CHARLOTTE HAS SEEN IN THE WAR MAKE A RETURN TO HER PRE WAR LIFE IMPOSSIBLE 
SHE GETS HERSELF A JOB AND BECOMES MORE INDEPENDENT 
NOW SHE SMOKES IN PUBLIC WEARS HER HAIR AND DRESSES SHORT AND USES MAKE UP 
AT WEEKENDS SHE GOES TO PARTIES WITHOUT A CHAPERONE 
THINGS WERE NEVER THE SAME AGAIN FOR MR. ELLIS 
THERE IS A BRIEF POST WAR BOOM IN CARDIFF DOCKS 
BUT SOON BRITISH COAL EXPORTS ARE UNDERMINED BY CHEAPER FOREIGN COAL 
BRITAIN WAS NO LONGER THE RICH COUNTRY IT HAD BEEN 
THE WAR HAD BEEN PAID FOR WITH BORROWED MONEY 
AND BRITAIN'S DEBT STOOD AT SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINE MILLION 
AS A RESULT OF THE WAR TAXES HAD RISEN SHARPLY 
AND THE UPPER CLASSES COULDN'T MAINTAIN THE OLD LAVISH LIFESTYLES 
MR. ELLIS BLAMES IT ALL ON THE RISE OF THE WORKING CLASSES 
THE TRADE UNIONS MOVEMENT NOW WITH SIXTY FIVE MILLION MEMBERS 
SHOWED ITS MUSCLE IN A SERIES OF STRIKES IN THE EARLY TWENTIES 
IT WAS NOW A FORCE GOVERNMENTS HAD TO RECKON WITH THE FACE OF BRITISH POLITICS HAD CHANGED 
THE LABOUR PARTY WAS GAINING GROUND 
AND IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR WERE VOTED INTO GOVERNMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IN SOUTH WALES POLITICAL AGITATORS WERE REPORTEDLY STIRRING THE MINERS INTO ACTION AND EVEN REVOLUTION 
TO MR. ELLIS THE WORLD SEEMS TO BE DISSOLVING INTO A SOCIALIST MADNESS 
THE OLD WORLD THAT MR. AND MRS. ELLIS KNEW HAD GONE WITHOUT TRACE 
FOR THE YOUNG THE GREAT WAR HAD UPSET THE APPLE CART 
ALTHOUGH THE ELLISES ARE A FICTIONAL FAMILY THEY ARE REAL IN THE SENSE THAT EVERYTHING 
HAS BEEN BASED ON ACTUAL HISTORICAL EXAMPLES 
THESE EVENTS REALLY HAPPENED 
AND THESE PEOPLE THE RICH THE POOR THE MAIDS WORKERS NURSES AND SOLDIERS REALLY EXISTED 
BY LOOKING AT THE SHADOWS THEY LEFT BEHIND WE CAN SEE HOW BRITAIN WAS CHANGED BY THE GREAT WAR 
AND HOW IT BEGAN TO EVOLVE INTO THE COUNTRY WE LIVE IN TODAY 
THIS EPISODE OF HISTORY FILE WAS PRODUCED IN CARDIFF BY B. B. C. WALES 
IT WAS DEVISED AND CREATED BY THESE ACTORS MUSICIANS DESIGNERS TECHNICIANS AND PROGRAMME MAKERS 
AND NARRATED BY ME JULIET STEVENSON 
THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER WAS MR. DAI WILLIAMS WOTCHER 
IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE EUROPEAN POWERS GOT TOGETHER 
AND DIVIDED UP MOST OF AFRICA BETWEEN THEM 
AFRICA WAS SEEN AS A HUGE EMPTY LAND WITHOUT AN OWNER 
JUST WAITING FOR EUROPE TO EXPLOIT IT SO THEY TOOK IT 
THE PINK TERRITORIES ON THIS MAP BECAME BRITISH 
IN THE EAST THEY GOT A HUGE PIECE OF LAND 
WHICH THEY CALLED BRITISH EAST AFRICA LATER RENAMED KENYA 
IT BECAME PART OF THE GREAT BRITISH EMPIRE 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY A QUARTER OF THE WORLD WAS RULED BY THE BRITISH 
FROM CANADA TO AUSTRALIA AFRICA TO INDIA 
OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE LIVED WITHIN WHAT WAS THEN THE WORLD'S GREATEST EMPIRE 
THE TINY ISLAND OF BRITAIN WAS A SUPREME WORLD POWER 
WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE THE EMPIRE IN THIS PROGRAMME 
BY FOLLOWING THE FORTUNES OF THE GRANT FAMILY WHO SETTLED IN KENYA 
THROUGH THEIR STORY WE CAN LEARN HOW THE EMPIRE WORKED 
AND WHY ULTIMATELY IT ENDED 
ON THE FOURTH OF SEPTEMBER NINETEEN THIRTEEN THE GRANT FAMILY MAJOR JOCELYN 
HIS WIFE NELLIE AND DAUGHTER ELSPETH SET SAIL FROM BRITAIN 
FOR A REMOTE COLONY CALLED KENYA LURED BY THE PROMISE OF A NEW LIFE 
WIN A GOLDEN RETURN IN AFRICA CLIMATE AND SOIL ALIKE WORK FOR THE SETTLER 
CROPS OF ALL SORTS FLOURISH PROLIFICALLY 
LABOUR IS CHEAP THE LIFE IS HEALTHY AND FREE FROM HOME CONVENTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS 
IT IS THE IDEAL LIFE FOR THE ENERGETIC AND ENTERPRISING 
SIX WEEKS LATER THEY ARRIVE AT THE PORT OF MOMBASA 
ALL AROUND THEM KENYAN PRODUCE TEA COFFEE COCONUTS AND MAIZE 
WAS BEING LOADED ONTO SHIPS TO BE SENT BACK TO BRITAIN 
THROUGH ITS EMPIRE BRITAIN CONTROLLED SIXTY PER CENT OF THE WORLD'S RUBBER 
FIFTY PER CENT OF THE WORLD'S RICE AND SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE WORLD'S GOLD PRODUCTION 
FOR BRITAIN THE EMPIRE PROVIDED A READY MADE MARKET FOR THEIR MANUFACTURED GOODS LIKE TRAINS 
FROM MOMBASA THE GRANTS TAKE THE TRAIN TO THE CAPITAL NAIROBI 
TRAVELLING IN A FIRST CLASS CARRIAGE WHITES ONLY 
IN NAIROBI THERE'S MUCH TO MAKE THEM FEEL AT HOME 
BRITISH STYLE HOTELS CHURCHES TEA SHOPS AND BANKS 
THEY MOVE ON TO A SMALL SETTLEMENT CALLED THIKA 
HERE THEY BUILD A HOUSE AND ESTABLISH A COFFEE PLANTATION 
LAND IN KENYA WAS PLENTIFUL AND CHEAP 
SIR HARRY JOHNSTON A COLONIAL ADMINISTRATOR 
THOUGHT THAT THE BRITISH WERE BUILDING UP KENYA OUT OF NOTHING 
SIR HARRY WAS WRONG 
IN FACT THERE HAD BEEN AFRICAN PEOPLE IN THE AREA THE WHITES CALLED KENYA FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
AND THEY HAD A THRIVING CULTURE 
IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE TO US NOW BUT THE BRITISH DREW LINES ACROSS THEIR LANDS AND SET UP FARMS 
TRIBES LIKE THE KIKUYU WERE UPROOTED 
EVEN THOUGH THEY'D SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BRITISH MANY YEARS BEFORE 
THE WHITES DISMISSED AFRICAN PEOPLE AS UNIMPORTANT SAVAGES 
IN NEED OF CIVILISATION 
SCHOOLS SET UP BY MISSIONARIES TAUGHT THEM ABOUT CHRISTIANITY 
AND GAVE THEM A EUROPEAN EDUCATION TO REPLACE THEIR TRIBAL CULTURES 
TO THE BRITISH THE WAY THEY LIVED AND DRESSED SEEMED PRIMITIVE AND NOT WORTH PRESERVING 
THEY SET ABOUT INTRODUCING THEM TO A MORE BRITISH WAY OF LIFE 
THIS IS THE INTERIOR OF A TRADITIONAL KIKUYU HUT 
AND HERE'S THE BRITISH VERSION COMPLETE WITH TEAPOT 
BUT HOWEVER MUCH THEY ABSORBED BRITISH WAYS 
IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WHITE MAN WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN ON TOP 
BACK AT THIKA THE GRANT FAMILY HAD TO WAIT FIVE YEARS FOR THEIR FIRST CROP OF COFFEE 
ADAPTING TO THE UNFAMILIAR CONDITIONS OF THE COUNTRY WASN'T EASY AS NELLIE GRANT RECALLS 
SEVENTH OF APRIL A TERRIFIC LOCUST INVASION AND A GRASS FIRE 
AND STILL NO SIGNS OF THE RAIN 
THE HEAT AND DUST AND DRYNESS ARE FOUL BEYOND WORDS 
TENTH OF SEPTEMBER THE DAMNED LOCUSTS COME EVERY DAY NOW 
NOT A SIGN OF RAIN EITHER 
DESPITE THE SETBACKS THE FARM EARNED THE GRANTS UP TO TWENTY FIVE A MONTH 
NOT A LOT BY BRITISH STANDARDS 
BUT IN KENYA AT THAT TIME THAT MONEY WENT A LONG WAY 
THE WEALTHIER BRITISH COLONISTS COULD ENJOY A STANDARD OF LIVING 
THAT THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD IN BRITAIN 
COCKTAILS AT THE BLUE POSTS HOTEL 
AND PARTIES UNTIL THE AFRICAN DAWN 
AND THEN IT WAS OFF ON SAFARI TO SHOOT THE LOCAL WILDLIFE 
BY THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THE GRANTS WERE ABLE TO AFFORD A NEW BUNGALOW AND EMPLOY SERVANTS 
THE GRANTS LIKED AND TREATED THEIR SERVANTS WELL 
NELLIE'S PHOTOGRAPH OF KARANGA AND MBUGWA HAS THE AIR OF A FAMILY SNAPSHOT 
LIFE IN THE EMPIRE COULD BE REWARDING 
IF YOU WERE WHITE 
AS LONG AS THE WORLD GOES ROUND AND ROUND 
MOST PEOPLE IN BRITAIN HAD NEVER SEEN A KENYAN IN THE FLESH NOR ANY OTHER PERSON WITH REALLY BLACK SKIN 
IF THEY WEREN'T BEING PORTRAYED AS SAVAGES 
BLACK PEOPLE WERE SEEN AS HARMLESS FIGURES OF FUN 
IT'S NOT SURPRISING BRITAIN'S RIGHT TO RULE OVERSEAS WASN'T QUESTIONED 
THESE ATTITUDES WERE INGRAINED FROM BIRTH 
EVERY YEAR SCHOOLCHILDREN CELEBRATED EMPIRE DAY 
I WANT TO TELL YOU CHILDREN THAT YOU ARE EACH ONE OF YOU 
A MEMBER OF THE EMPIRE AND WHEN YOU SING THAT YOU'RE PROUD OF THE EMPIRE 
I WANT YOU TO FEEL PROUD OF YOURSELVES 
IT WAS CELEBRATED WITH SONGS AND PAGEANTS THE TALLEST GIRL IN SCHOOL DRESSING UP AS BRITANNIA 
THE OTHERS REPRESENTING EMPIRE COUNTRIES PAID HOMAGE TO THEIR RULER 
PEOPLE FOUND REMINDERS OF BRITAIN'S WORLD STATUS IN THEIR DAILY LIVES 
YOU COULD BUY EXOTIC GOODS FROM THE COLONIES 
OR VISIT AN EMPIRE THEATRE OR CINEMA 
FROM NAIROBI IN KENYA COMES ANOTHER HAPPY PICTURE 
OF BRITISH CELEBRATIONS IN A DISTANT TERRITORY OF EMPIRE 
BY THE NINETEEN THIRTIES LOOKING AFTER SUCH AN EMPIRE WAS BECOMING DIFFICULT 
MUCH OF THE NAVY WAS EMPLOYED TO PROTECT ITS FAR FLUNG TERRITORIES 
AND A THIRD OF THE ARMY WAS IN INDIA ALONE 
PEOPLE IN THE EMPIRE QUESTIONED BRITAIN'S RIGHT TO RULE THEM 
AND THREATS OF THIS NATURE WERE DEALT WITH HARSHLY 
THE GARDEN PARTY AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE EXHIBITS A CHARACTERISTIC TEMPER OF INTENSE LOYALTY 
IN BRITAIN THE EMPIRE WAS SHOWN TO BE PEACEFUL HAPPY 
AND SET TO LAST FOR CENTURIES IT DIDN'T 
THE EMPIRE PROVED INDISPENSABLE TO BRITAIN DURING THE WAR 
IT PROVIDED PORTS NAVAL BASES AND ABOVE ALL SOLDIERS 
AFRICANS ASIANS CARIBBEANS CANADIANS NEW ZEALANDERS 
AND OTHERS FOUGHT ENTHUSIASTICALLY SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE BRITISH 
EVEN SO OLD PREJUDICES WERE HARD TO DISCARD 
A TIMES ARTICLE FROM NINETEEN FORTY CONCLUDED THE AFRICA RACES WERE 
CONSIDERED TO BE THE MORE BACKWARD OF MANKIND 
YET SHOW SPONTANEITY AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE ISSUE 
THEY KNOW THAT THE EMPIRE OF WHICH THEY ARE MEMBERS IS BEING CHALLENGED 
AND ARE EAGER IN THEIR SIMPLE WAY TO HELP IN DEFENDING IT 
EVEN WHEN SONS OF AFRICA WERE DYING FOR BRITAIN 
SOME PEOPLE WERE STILL UNABLE TO SEE AFRICANS AS EQUALS 
AFTER THE WAR BRITAIN'S GRIP ON THE EMPIRE BEGAN TO SLIP 
BRITAIN WAS BANKRUPT NO LONGER WITH THE POWER TO CONTROL AN EMPIRE 
IN THIS EXHAUSTED BRITAIN ATTITUDES AT LAST BEGAN TO CHANGE 
PEOPLE WANTED TO REBUILD THE COUNTRY INTO A FAIRER SOCIETY 
HOLDING ON TO THE EMPIRE DIDN'T FIT IN WITH THIS 
WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS WAS FORMED ALL COUNTRIES INCLUDING BRITAIN 
AGREED A DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS SAYING ALL MEN AND WOMEN BLACK AND WHITE WERE EQUAL 
NATIONAL DELEGATES STAND FOR THE CHARTER THEY FORGED TOGETHER 
FIFTY NATIONS UNANIMOUS FOR PEACE 
THE IDEA OF A SMALL COUNTRY LIKE BRITAIN HOLDING ON TO A VAST EMPIRE 
SUDDENLY SEEMED OUT OF STEP WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD 
BACK IN KENYA THE GRANTS' FORTUNES WERE DECLINING 
OLD MAJOR GRANT A VETERAN OF TWO WORLD WARS DIED IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN 
NELLIE KEEPS ON THE FARM BUT THE KENYA AROUND HER IS CHANGING 
NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND KENYANS FOUGHT IN THE WAR AND SAW THE WORLD OUTSIDE 
MANY RETURNED TO MENIAL JOBS AND POVERTY 
AFRICAN NATIONALISTS PROTESTED AFRICA FOR THE AFRICANS THEY SAID 
AN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT WAS BORN 
ITS AIM TO UNITE ALL KENYAN TRIBES INTO ONE NATION 
AT ITS HEAD WAS JOMO KENYATTA 
SURELY IF WE ARE CONSIDERED FIT ENOUGH TO TAKE OUR RIFLES AND FIGHT SIDE BY SIDE WITH WHITE MEN 
WE HAVE A RIGHT TO A DIRECT SAY IN THE RUNNING OF OUR COUNTRY 
SOME YOUNG AFRICANS TOOK TO ARMS THE BRITISH OFFERED FIVE A HEAD 
TO ANYBODY SHOOTING THESE PEOPLE WHOM THE SETTLERS CALLED MAU MAU 
AFRICANS WHO FOUGHT FOR THE BRITISH WERE SEEN AS TRAITORS 
AND BECAME TARGETS FOR SOME OF THE MAU MAU'S WORST ATROCITIES 
THE HORRIBLE MAU MAU MASSACRE NEAR NAIROBI IN KENYA 
A VILLAGE TURNED INTO A FUNERAL PYRE FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY KIKUYU TRIBESMEN 
ONLY A HANDFUL SURVIVED THE RAID 
THE MEDIA FOCUSED ON MAU MAU ATROCITIES RATHER THAN INDEPENDENCE 
ALLEGED BRITISH MISTREATMENT OF MAU MAU PRISONERS WENT UNREPORTED 
COLONIAL POLICE ACT AFTER THIS BLOODY UPRISING 
ROUNDING UP FIVE HUNDRED NATIVE SUSPECTS OF THE DREAD SECRET SOCIETY 
BARBARIANS WHO WILL SLAUGHTER EVEN THEIR FELLOW TRIBESMEN 
IN THEIR PLEDGE TO DRIVE THE WHITE MAN FROM KENYA 
THE MAU MAU WERE A REAL THREAT TO ISOLATED SETTLERS 
NELLIE DISCOVERED KARANGA HER COOK HAD MAU MAU CONNECTIONS SHE WAS WORRIED 
NINTH OF OCTOBER NINETEEN FIFTY TWO ON TUESDAY POOR OLD CHIEF WARUHIU GOT MURDERED 
AND ANOTHER EUROPEAN WOMAN STABBED TO DEATH THE SECOND IN A FORTNIGHT 
SO NOW I'M TAKING THE FIREARM QUESTION SERIOUSLY 
AND GOING TO THE POLICE TO BE TOLD HOW TO LOAD MY REVOLVER 
WHITE SETTLERS STRUGGLED TO KEEP THEIR PREWAR WAY OF LIFE IN SPITE OF THE REAL SITUATION IN KENYA 
BUT HOME GROWN MILITIA AND ARMED SETTLERS COULD NOT COPE 
BRITISH TROOPS POURED INTO KENYA 
THE OLD GUARD OF THE EMPIRE STILL HELD ON NOW HOPELESSLY OUT OF STEP WITH WORLD OPINION 
EVEN BACK IN BRITAIN PEOPLE STARTED TO QUESTION WHETHER ALL THIS CONFLICT WAS JUSTIFIABLE 
IN THE STRUGGLE FOR KENYAN INDEPENDENCE 
ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MAU MAU WERE KILLED 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN BRITISH SOLDIERS 
AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED CIVILIANS 
MOSTLY BLACK ALSO DIED 
ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH 
UHURU INDEPENDENCE FOR KENYA IN LINE MR. SANDS MR. MACDONALD THE NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL 
AND JOMO KENYATTA MAU MAU LEADER NOW PRIME MINISTER 
BRITAIN SAID FAREWELL TO ITS COLONY PEACEFULLY 
BUT NOT WITHOUT REMINDING IT OF ITS DEBT TO BRITAIN 
'. WITH BRITISH STYLE GOVERNMENT KENYA LOOKS TO THE FUTURE 
A TIME OF REJOICING BUT ALSO REGRET 
MANY EUROPEANS WHO GREW WITH KENYA NOW SEE THEMSELVES AS DISPOSSESSED 
ON THE TWELFTH OF DECEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE FLAG IS LOWERED ON BRITISH KENYA 
AND AFRICAN KENYA IS BORN 
SOME WHITE FARMERS PREPARE TO GIVE UP 
FOR NELLIE GRANT IT MEANS GIVING UP ALL SHE'S LIVED AND WORKED FOR 
I FEEL BITTERLY ABOUT BEING SUCH A POOR RELATION CRAWLING HOME AND BEING A NUISANCE 
POLITICS RAGING OF COURSE IT HARDLY BEARS THINKING OF THE NEAR FUTURE I MEAN 
BUT EIGHTY YEAR OLD NELLIE STAYS ON FOR TWO YEARS 
BEFORE SELLING HER FARM FOR NINE HUNDRED TO HER OLD KIKUYU WORKERS 
ALL THE POSSESSIONS SHE TAKES WITH HER ARE PACKED INTO THE SAME THREE TRUNKS SHE ARRIVED WITH IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN 
IN EIGHTY YEARS THE PEOPLE OF KENYA HAD JOURNEYED FROM FREEDOM TO COLONIALISM TO INDEPENDENCE 
THE FUTURE OF AFRICA WAS AT LAST BACK IN AFRICAN HANDS 
KENYA WAS THE LAST PART OF THE EMPIRE THAT BRITAIN TRIED TO KEEP BY FORCE 
LITTLE BY LITTLE THE EMPIRE THAT HAD ONCE CONTROLLED A QUARTER OF THE WORLD PEELED AWAY 
LEAVING THE ISLAND OF BRITAIN JUST ANOTHER COUNTRY ON THE MAP 
THIS EPISODE OF HISTORY FILE WAS PRODUCED IN CARDIFF BY B. B. C. WALES 
IT WAS MADE BY THIS ESPECIALLY ASSEMBLED TEAM 
OF ACTORS MUSICIANS DESIGNERS TECHNICIANS AND PROGRAMME MAKERS 
AND NARRATED BY JULIET STEVENSON EXECUTIVE PRODUCER WAS DAI WILLIAMS 
WOTCHA 
AN AWESOME MOMENT AS THE FIRST ROCKET PLANE IS FUELLED FOR FLIGHT 
AN ASBESTOS CLAD SCIENTIST LIGHTS IT 
THERE'S NO TELLING HOW FAR THIS REVOLUTIONARY ROCKET MAY TRAVEL 
PERHAPS INTO OUTER SPACE PERHAPS TO THE VERY MOON 
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY HAS BEEN A TIME OF ENORMOUS TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE 
EVEN A BASIC OBJECT LIKE THE TELEPHONE HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED BY TECHNOLOGY 
FROM A LUXURY TO A NECESSITY WE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT 
IN THIS PROGRAMME WE WILL EXPLORE HOW THE CHANGING FACE OF TECHNOLOGY 
FOR MOST PEOPLE WHO LIVED EARLY THIS CENTURY FACILITIES IN THE HOME WOULD BE QUITE BASIC 
MANY HOUSES HAD NO RUNNING WATER 
AND WOULD SHARE A PUMP IN THE STREET WITH SEVERAL OTHER HOUSES 
PEGGY JONES WAS BORN IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE 
OUR TOILET AS THEY CALL IT NOW WAS UP AT THE TOP OF THE GARDEN 
IT WAS A LITTLE SHED IN A WAY 
AND THERE WASN'T A CHAIN TO PULL THE WATERS 
SO YOU JUST DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO AND THEN YOU WENT BACK DOWN 
DONALD MACGREGOR WAS BORN IN NINETEEN TWELVE 
IF IT WAS RAINING IT WAS AN AWFUL BUSINESS 
FORTUNATELY WE WERE OF THE POSITION THAT WE HAD CHAMBER POTS 
CALLED BY ALL SORTS OF NAMES AND THAT WAS ALL RIGHT 
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO AIM IN THE DARK YOU LIT A CANDLE OR OIL LAMP 
ELECTRIC LIGHT WAS A LUXURY ONLY FOR THE RICH 
THIS IS HOW LIFE HAD BEEN FOR CENTURIES 
WE DIDN'T HAVE ELECTRICITY IN OUR HOUSE 
SO WHEN WE WENT TO BED MY MOTHER WOULD GIVE US A CANDLE 
SO WE WERE LIKE WILLY WINKIE GOING UP TO BED WITH THESE CANDLESTICKS IN OUR HANDS 
WE KEPT THE CANDLE ALIGHT UNTIL WE HAD UNDRESSED THEN WE BLEW IT OUT 
PEOPLE AWOKE TO COLD HOUSES AND A COLD WASH BEFORE THE FIRES WERE LIT 
EVERYONE DEPENDED ON COAL TO HEAT THEIR HOUSES AND COOK THEIR FOOD 
BEFORE YOU COULD COOK BREAKFAST YOU HAD TO LIGHT THE RANGE 
THE FIRE HAD TO BE LIT EVERY MORNING THE ASHES CLEARED OUT 
THERE WERE BIG GRATES THIS HEIGHT THEY STARTED OFF WITH PAPER AND STICK AND THEN PILED UP THE COAL 
IT WAS QUITE A LOT OF WORK BECAUSE YOU HAD TO CLEAR THE ASHES OUT AND RELIGHT IT EVERY MORNING 
BUT YOU TOOK IT FOR GRANTED 
ALL THE HOT WATER HAD TO BE BOILED ON THE STOVE 
FINE FOR A CUP OF TEA BUT IMAGINE FILLING A BATHTUB 
BATHS NO NEVER BOTHERED TO US 
WE WOULD PROBABLY GO INTO THE SCULLERY AND HAVE A BASIN 
AND WE WOULD BE PROBABLY STRIPPED NAKED 
AND WE WOULD HAVE A SPONGE AND WE WOULD GIVE OURSELVES A WASH DOWN 
THE RANGE WAS KEPT ALIGHT ALL DAY 
MOST PEOPLE COULDN'T AFFORD TO KEEP FIRES BURNING AROUND THE HOUSE 
SO THE WARM KITCHEN STOVE BECAME THE FOCUS OF THE HOME 
FOOD WAS USUALLY BOUGHT ON THE DAY IT WAS NEEDED 
NO ONE HAD REFRIGERATORS SO KEEPING IT FRESH WAS A PROBLEM 
COOKERY BOOKS SUGGESTED ALL SORTS OF WAYS OF PRESERVING FOOD 
FOR EXAMPLE WHAT TO DO WITH BUTTER IN HOT WEATHER 
A LARGE FLOWERPOT WRAPPED IN A WET CLOTH AND TURNED OVER THE BUTTER 
OR SOME FRESH CABBAGE LEAVES AROUND IT WILL KEEP IT FIRM 
HOUSEWORK WAS HARD PHYSICAL TOIL 
THE WEEKLY WASH TOOK A WHOLE DAY 
THEY HAD TO RUB AND RUB AND RUB WITH BIG SLABS OF SOAP 
SOME PEOPLE THEN HAD A BIG WOODEN MANGLE 
YOU'D PUT THE CLOTHES THROUGH THIS MANGLE AND IT WAS HARD WORK TURNING THE HANDLE 
SOME TECHNOLOGY DID EXIST TO HELP HOUSEWORK BUT IT WAS ALL HAND POWERED 
MY MOTHER HAD A SORT OF A WASHING MACHINE BUT IT WASN'T A REAL ONE 
SHE HAD TO BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH AND THAT WAS HARD WORK 
GRADUALLY OTHER SIMPLER MACHINES BECAME AVAILABLE 
THIS IS A MECHANICAL VEGETABLE CHOPPER 
BUT MANY LIKE THIS HAND OPERATED VACUUM CLEANER DIDN'T WORK VERY WELL AND WERE VERY EXPENSIVE 
ONLY THE RICH COULD AFFORD TO BUY THEM 
IT PROVED EASIER AND CHEAPER TO EMPLOY SERVANTS TO DO THEIR CHORES 
RATHER THAN BUYING NEW TECHNOLOGY 
PHYLLIS DAVIES STARTED IN SERVICE WHEN SHE WAS FOURTEEN 
I DID THE CLEANING VERY OFTEN I WAS CALLED AT SIX A M. TO GET UP 
NO WE DIDN'T HAVE A VACUUM CLEANER 
THEY WEREN'T THOUGHT OF REALLY THEN 
NO IT WAS A PUSH MACHINE 
AND A DUSTPAN AND BRUSH ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES 
IT WAS DIRTY OH YES 
THE DUST YOU'D GET FROM THE COAL AND YOU HAD TO KEEP YOURSELF CLEAN 
THAT WAS ALL IN A DAY'S WORK 
EVENTUALLY HOUSEMAIDS WERE REPLACED BY A NEW GENERATION 
OF EFFICIENT AND AFFORDABLE MECHANICAL DEVICES 
HOUSEWORK WAS ABOUT TO BECOME CLEANER AND EASIER 
WITH A NEW POWER SOURCE THAT COULD BE FED DIRECTLY INTO THE HOME ELECTRICITY 
FOR CENTURIES ELECTRICITY WAS ONE OF THE WILD UNTAMED FORCES OF NATURE 
NOW MEN CAN CONTROL IT AND PRODUCE IT ARTIFICALLY IN THE LABORATORY 
WITHIN FIFTY YEARS ELECTRICITY HAS CHANGED LIFE ON EARTH 
AND BECOME THE SERVANT OF HUMANITY 
IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES POWER STATIONS WERE BUILT 
PUMPING OUT ELECTRICITY DAY AND NIGHT 
HUGE PYLONS WERE ERECTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY BRINGING AFFORDABLE POWER INTO THE HOME 
HOUSEHOLD GADGETS WERE REDESIGNED AND IMPROVED 
TO UTILISE THIS NEW POWER SOURCE 
AT FIRST THEY WERE STILL LUXURIES 
BUT SOON THEY WERE MASS PRODUCED IN MODERN FACTORIES 
AND PRICES CAME DOWN 
ELECTRICITY WAS VERY VERY MODERN VERY VERY CLEAN 
INSTEAD OF HAVING CANDLES TO LIGHT US FOR AN EVENING MEAL 
WE COULD HAVE THE ELECTRIC BULB IT WAS FORTY WATTS 
AND WE WERE SO AMAZED THAT WE COULD GET SO MUCH LIGHT 
TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH DOWN AND THERE IT WAS YOU SAW THIS FORTY WATT BULB 
MEET GRANDMA DAWSON IN NUMBER FORTY FOUR 
SHE BLACK LEADED THIS GRATE FOR TWO HOURS A WEEK SINCE NINETEEN OH SEVEN FORTY FIVE YEARS 
AND NOW SHE'S BLACK LEADED IT FOR THE LAST TIME DOWN IT COMES' 
THE KITCHEN STOVE LOST ITS PLACE AS THE WARM FOCUS OF THE HOUSE 
INSTANT HEAT COULD NOW BE PLACED IN EVERY ROOM 
COAL FIRES WERE CONSIDERED DIRTY UNLESS IT WAS FAKE 
YOU COULD STILL GET THE LOOK WITHOUT THE INCONVENIENCE 
VACUUM CLEANING TECHNOLOGY WAS IMPROVING 
BY THE NINETEEN FIFTIES MASS PRODUCTION WAS MAKING THEM CHEAPER 
THE ARRIVAL OF SARAH DUNN'S FIRST VACUUM CLEANER WAS QUITE AN EVENT 
I BOUGHT A VACUUM CLEANER A HOOVER IT WAS WONDERFUL 
IT PICKED UP THE DUST PICKED UP EVERYTHING SAVED A LOT OF WORK A LOT OF SWEEPING IT WAS GREAT 
A CUP OF TEA OR INSTANT COOKING AT THE FLICK OF A SWITCH 
KEEPING BUTTER FRESH WAS NO LONGER A PROBLEM 
I DIDN'T HAVE A FRIDGE BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK I NEEDED ONE 
WHEN YOU HAVEN'T HAD IT YOU DON'T MISS IT WHEN YOU'VE HAD A FRIDGE YOU THINK HOW DID I MANAGE 
THE FOUR FOUNDATIONS OF MODERN LIVING THE ELECTRIC COOKER 
THE ELECTRIC REFRIGERATOR THE ELECTRIC WATER HEATER AND THE ELECTRIC WASHING MACHINE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE KEYMATIC I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL 
TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS UNIQUE WASHING PROCESS 
IT SAVES US DOING ALL THAT HARD WORK DOESN'T IT 
YOU THINK OF WASHING ALL THAT WASHING 
NOW YOU PUT EVERYTHING INTO THE WASHING MACHINE AND IT COMES OUT CLEAN ALMOST DRY 
LUXURIES LIKE HOT AND COLD RUNNING WATER WERE BECOMING NECESSITIES THAT NO ONE COULD DO WITHOUT 
THE CHAMBER POT WAS OBSOLETE 
THE HOUSE WAS NOW LIGHT WARM AND EASY TO CLEAN 
YOU COULD PHONE FRIENDS 
OR ENJOY A STARTLING INVENTION CALLED THE TELEVISION 
WATCHING TELEVISION TOOK OFF IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
AND BECAME THE MAIN WAY IN WHICH OUR SOCIETY RELAXES 
REPLACING THE WARM KITCHEN STOVE AS THE FOCUS OF THE HOME 
'. THE CAR AND ITS IMPACT ON US 
OUTSIDE ANOTHER TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION WAS TAKING PLACE 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY CARS WERE SO UNFAMILIAR ON BRITISH ROADS 
THAT A MAN WITH A FLAG HAD TO WALK OUT IN FRONT TO WARN PEOPLE 
THE EARLIEST MODELS WERE HAND BUILT 
ALMOST LIKE PIECES OF FURNITURE WITH WOODEN WHEELS AND AN ENGINE 
TECHNOLOGY ADVANCED QUICKLY BUT EVEN WHEN THIS CAR WAS MADE IN NINETEEN ELEVEN 
IT WOULD HAVE COST SEVERAL TIMES THE ANNUAL SALARY OF THE WORKERS WHO MADE IT 
FOR THE ORDINARY PERSON A JOB AS A CHAUFFEUR 
WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GET YOUR HANDS ON THE WHEEL 
AT THIS TIME CARS WERE STILL A RARITY ON OUR STREETS 
EVEN BUSES WERE HORSE DRAWN 
THIS BUS NICKNAMED THE TOAST RACK 
CARRIED PEOPLE AROUND THE STREETS OF SOUTH WALES AROUND NINETEEN TWELVE 
HORSES ALSO PULLED DELIVERY VANS THAT CAME TO YOUR DOOR 
THERE WAS THE MILK CART 
HE HAD A CART WITH BIG CHURNS FULL OF MILK 
AND YOU HAD TO TAKE A JUG TO GET THE MILK NO BOTTLES 
THEN THERE WAS THE BUTCHER HE CAME IN A ROUND CART THAT WAS UNUSUAL 
THE BREAD MAN HE CAME ROUND 
WE USED TO LOVE TO SEE THESE THINGS COMING THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OF ENTERTAINMENT 
THE MAN WHO DID MORE THAN ANYONE TO MAKE THE HORSE REDUNDANT WAS AN AMERICAN HIS NAME WAS HENRY FORD 
BY MASS PRODUCING CARS ON PRODUCTION LINES 
HE REDUCED THE TIME TO MAKE A CAR FROM TWELVE TO ONE HOURS PRICES FELL 
NOW A FORD WORKER COULD BUY ONE OF HIS MODEL T.'S FOR LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS' WAGES 
CAR MANUFACTURING WAS TRANSFORMED 
THE NOVELTY OF THE RICH 
WAS ON ITS WAY TO BECOMING A PART OF DAILY LIFE FOR EVERYONE 
ONE OF MY FRIENDS HER FATHER BOUGHT A FORD CAR I THINK IT WAS 
AND HER FATHER AND MOTHER ASKED ME WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME FOR A RIDE IN THE CAR 
OH RIDE IN THE CAR IT WAS LIKE ASKING ME TO GO INTO SPACE NOW 
BY NINETEEN THIRTY THERE WERE A MILLION CARS ON BRITISH ROADS 
THERE WAS NO DRIVING TEST YOU COULD GET IN A CAR AND DRIVE AWAY 
ROAD ACCIDENTS SOARED 
A DRIVING TEST WAS INTRODUCED IN NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR 
ROADS WERE IMPROVED AS WELL AS STANDARDS OF DRIVING 
PETROL WAS CHEAP AND THE CAR ENJOYED ITS HEYDAY 
I ACTUALLY BOUGHT MY FIRST CAR IN ABOUT NINETEEN FIFTY 
AND IT WAS AN OLD NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT FORD 
AND AGAIN IT HAD THREE FORWARD GEARS AND ONE REVERSE 
IT WAS WONDERFUL FOR SHOPPING 
WE COULD BUY EXTRA THINGS THE EXTRA WAS ALWAYS ABLE TO BE FITTED INTO THE BOOT 
AS WELL AS SHOPPING TRIPS CARS BECAME A NECESSITY FOR GETTING TO WORK TAKING THE KIDS TO SCHOOL 
OR JUST GOING OUT FOR A SPIN 
THIS ENABLED US TO GO FURTHER AND FURTHER AFIELD 
YOU COULD PACK EVERYTHING INTO THE BOOT SWIMMING SUITS LUNCHES 
AND WE COULD GO DOWN TO THE SEASIDE WITHOUT ANY ADO 
IT WAS WONDERFUL 
IT WAS WONDERFUL EXCEPT OF COURSE WHEN EVERYONE HAD THE SAME IDEA 
A NEW PHENOMENON WAS BORN THE TRAFFIC JAM 
MORE CARS MEANT MORE ROADS MORE ROADS LED TO MORE CARS 
BY NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THERE MORE THAN FOURTEEN MILLION CARS ON BRITISH ROADS 
HENRY FORD WAS RIGHT WHEN HE PREDICTED THAT THE HORSE WOULD DISAPPEAR FROM OUR HIGHWAYS 
BUT EVEN HE DIDN'T PREDICT THAT TODAY THERE ARE MORE CARS THAN FAMILIES IN BRITAIN 
DONALD 
PHYLLIS 
SARAH 
AND PEGGY 
HAVE LIVED THROUGH A PERIOD OF EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE 
AS CHILDREN THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DREAMT OF LIVING IN A HOUSE 
WHICH A MACHINE COULD HEAT WHILST THEY SLEPT 
OR OF MACHINES THAT CAN ANSWER THE PHONE WASH CLOTHES AND COOK FOOD 
WITHIN A CENTURY TECHNOLOGY HAS TRANSFORMED EVERY ASPECT OF OUR DAILY LIVES 
BUT CAN PROGRESS CONTINUE AT THIS RATE THE ONLY THING THAT'S CERTAIN 
IS THAT EVERYTHING WE THINK OF AS MODERN 
WILL TO FUTURE GENERATIONS APPEAR AS OLD FASHIONED AS THE CHAMBER POT 
THIS EPISODE OF HISTORY FILE WAS PRODUCED IN CARDIFF BY B. B. C. WALES 
IT WAS DEVISED AND CREATED BY THIS ESPECIALLY ASSEMBLED TEAM OF ACTORS MUSICIANS DESIGNERS 
TECHNICIANS AND PROGRAMME MAKERS 
AND NARRATED BY ME JULIET STEVENSON 
THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER WAS MR. DAI WILLIAMS WOTCHA 
HE BECAME A LABOURER ON A BUILDING SITE 
ADVERTS EXIST SOLELY TO SELL PRODUCTS AND MANY OF THEM ARE AIMED AT WOMEN 
KATIE SPEAKING 
PHILIP'S TRYING TO READ HIS PAPER BUT HE CAN SMELL THE OXO JACKETATOES I'M COOKING 
ADVERTS MAY AT FIRST SIGHT APPEAR TO BE AN UNRELIABLE HISTORICAL SOURCE BUT DON'T REJECT THEM 
THEY CAN PROVIDE A VIVID INSIGHT INTO HOW PEOPLE THOUGHT AT THE TIME THEY WERE MADE 
CLEVER GIRL 
YOU SEE THE ADVERTISEMENT'S RIGHT OXO GIVES A MEAL MAN APPEAL 
IN THIS PROGRAMME WE ARE GOING TO COMPARE THE ADVERTISERS' DREAM 
WITH THE DAY TO DAY REALITY OF WOMEN'S LIVES AT VARIOUS CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
IN THE EARLY PART OF THE CENTURY THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT ABOUT IT 
RICH OR POOR WOMEN WERE DEPENDENT ON MEN AND THEIR PLACE WAS IN THE HOME 
IT TOOK THE WORLD WARS TO CHANGE THIS 
WORLD WAR TWO CHANGED WOMEN'S LIVES IN MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT WORLD WAR ONE HAD DONE 
WITH THE MEN AWAY FIGHTING WOMEN HAD TO COME OUT OF THE HOME 
THE PRIORITY WAS NOT MAKING BABIES BUT BOMBS 
EVERY MAN WHO CAN FIGHT IS NEEDED FOR FIGHTING 
AND IT IS UP TO THE WOMEN OF BRITAIN TO TAKE OVER NON COMBATANT DUTIES 
WHETHER YOU ARE MARRIED OR SINGLE THERE IS A JOB WAITING FOR YOU A JOB THAT MUST BE FILLED 
YOU ARE NEEDED IN THE AAFS IN THE WRNS IN THE WAAF 
WOMEN'S MAGAZINES WERE ALSO MOBILISED TO PERSUADE THEM INTO THE WORKPLACE 
THEIR COVERS FEATURED HEROIC PICTURES OF WOMEN 
DOING EVERYTHING FROM PLANTING POTATOES TO MAKING PARACHUTES 
INSIDE THE MAGAZINES ADVERTISERS USED THE SAME KINDS OF PICTURES TO SELL EVERYDAY PRODUCTS 
THE HAND THAT HELD THE HOOVER DRIVES A CRANE 
WOMEN ARE WINNING THE WAR OF FREEDOM WITH TAMPAX 
THE WAR OFFICE SAW THE POTENTIAL FOR PROPAGANDA 
AND DESPATCHED ARTIST LAURA KNIGHT TO A NEWPORT FACTORY TO PAINT A WORKING WOMAN 
SHE CHOSE A GUN ENGINEER CALLED RUBY LOFTUS 
I HAVE PAINTED RUBY WORKING ON A LATHE SCREWING A BREECH RING 
WHICH TILL NOW HAS ONLY BEEN DONE BY MEN OF EXCEPTIONAL ENGINEERING SKILL AFTER EIGHT TO NINE YEARS' TRAINING 
AND SHE CAN DO IT AFTER ONLY FOUR MONTHS 
THIS HEROIC IMAGE OF RUBY WAS IDEALISED 
HER SISTER ELSIE PROVIDES CONTRASTING EVIDENCE 
BEFORE THE WAR GIRLS DID NOTHING LIKE THAT THEY WOULDN'T THINK OF IT 
WE WERE ALL BLISTERS IN THE BEGINNING 
IT WASN'T AN EASY JOB TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO BECAUSE A GIRL DOESN'T EXPECT ALL THAT 
ADVERTISERS REALISED THAT IT WASN'T A GLAMOROUS JOB 
SHIFT GREASE AND DIRT WITH ZIXT 
WOMEN LIKE ELSIE DID THE SAME WORK AS MEN 
BUT THEY WEREN'T TREATED AS EQUALS 
I WAS DOING K. STRIKERS AND ONE YOUNG MAN IN THE NEXT AISLE HE'D COME AND BORROW A COUPLE OF MINE 
IF HE HADN'T GOT ENOUGH TO GET HIS BONUS FOR THE WEEK 
THEY WERE ON BONUSES THE MEN WE WEREN'T IN THE BEGINNING BUT WE DID FIGHT FOR THAT 
WHEN THE WAR ENDED IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
THE SAME MAGAZINES THAT HAD CREATED HEROIC WOMAN RETURNED TO IMAGES OF DOMESTIC WOMAN 
I WAS QUITE HAPPY TO GO INTO THE HOME 
BECAUSE THE MEN CAME BACK THEY WANTED THEIR JOBS BACK 
THE WOMEN HAD TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO BEING AT HOME AND BEING MOTHERS 
FOR THE MAN CHARGED WITH SHAPING BRITAIN'S FUTURE SIR WILLIAM BEVERIDGE 
A WOMAN'S PLACE WAS NOW IN THE HOME 
IN THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS 
THIS IDEA WAS EAGERLY PICKED UP BY THE SAME ADVERTISERS WHO'D ONCE CELEBRATED WOMEN'S WAR WORK 
THEY NOW ENCOURAGED WOMEN TO FIGHT GERMS INSTEAD OF GERMANS 
AND MOTHERHOOD WAS PORTRAYED AS THE IDEAL FOR THE WOMAN OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
YOUR AFTER THE WAR DREAM IS COMING TRUE 
NOT SURPRISINGLY FOR MANY GIRLS OF THE FIFTIES IT WAS MARRIAGE THAT GAVE THEM THEIR PLACE IN THE WORLD 
ON THE DAY JANE WAS WED A DOUBT CREPT INTO HER FAIR HEAD 
HER BAKING WOULD IT BE A SUCCESS OR A FLOP 
NEVER FEAR COOKEEN IS HERE 
SUCH ADVERTS REFLECT THAT FOR MANY WOMEN HOUSEWORK WAS THE PRINCIPAL ROUTE TO FULFILMENT AND ACHIEVEMENT 
AND ADVERTISERS EAGERLY TOUTED PRODUCTS TO HELP WOMEN EXCEL 
SO I SAID BUT WHITE'S WHITE I TOOK OUT MY HANKIE AND SAID NOW I CALL THAT WHITE 
AND SHE SAID WELL I DON'T WANT TO BOAST BUT I USE PERSIL AND SHE TOOK OUT HER HANKIE 
AND IT WAS MILES WHITER THAN MINE 
BUT IS THIS ADVERTISER'S VISION OF COMPETING WIVES A RELIABLE ONE FOR HISTORIANS 
OH IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO GET THE WASH CLEAN AND WHITE AS POSSIBLE 
WHEN A WOMAN DID HER WASHING AND HUNG IT ON THE LINE THE NEIGHBOURS WOULD LOOK AT IT AND TALK ABOUT IT 
LOOK SHE HASN'T WASHED PROPERLY LOOK AT THE HOLES IN THE TOWELS 
SARAH WAS A YOUNG BRIDE IN THE FIFTIES 
ANOTHER ASPECT OF HER EARLY MARRIED LIFE WAS TOTAL DEPENDENCE ON HER HUSBAND FOR MONEY 
AS A YOUNG WOMAN FOR INSTANCE I COULDN'T GO INTO A SHOP AND BUY CLOTHES ON THE HIRE PURCHASE 
MY HUSBAND WOULD HAVE TO SIGN FOR IT I TRIED ONCE TO BUY A FUR COAT 
I THINK IT WAS C. AND AMP A.'S OH NO YOUR HUSBAND HAS TO SIGN FOR IT 
AND HE WOULDN'T SIGN I COULDN'T ARGUE VERY WELL WITH HIM REALLY 
IT SO HAPPENS THAT I'VE SAVED A BIT OUT OF HOUSEKEEPING 
THERE'S A HAT OH YES 
WHEN YOU ADD TWO OXO CUBES YOU CAN BE SURE 
BUT WAS THE PICTURE GIVEN BY SUCH ADVERTS THE WHOLE STORY 
OXO GIVES A MEAL MAN APPEAL 
IN FACT TWENTY TWO PER CENT OF MARRIED WOMEN HAD CONTINUED TO WORK AFTER THE WAR 
ESPECIALLY PART TIME JOBS IN LIGHT INDUSTRY 
THE NUMBER INCREASED IN THE FIFTIES 
THE WOMEN WORKED IN ORDER TO GET A FEW LITTLE EXTRA THINGS YOU KNOW 
HOLIDAYS AND MAYBE A FEW NICE CLOTHES OR SOMETHING FOR THE HOUSE THAT KIND OF THING 
HUSBANDS OF WORKING WIVES WERE NEVER SERIOUSLY EXPECTED TO HELP WITH THE HOUSEWORK 
FOR ADVERTISERS A MAN IN THE KITCHEN WAS A JOKE 
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE COOKING A PLEASURE 
DID THE SHOPPING COOKING WASHING CLEANING IRONING EVERYTHING 
OH THIS WAS EXPECTED OF ME IT WAS WHAT I WAS BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE THAT I HAD TO DO 
THE PROBLEM FOR A WORKING MOTHER WAS HOW TO HOLD DOWN A JOB AND YET FIND TIME TO BE A GOOD HOUSEWIFE 
ADVERTISERS BEGAN TO ADDRESS THIS DILEMMA 
WE MET MRS. DOBSON OUT SHOPPING DURING HER LUNCH HOUR 
AND THEY OFFERED A SOLUTION 
THERE TWO INDIVIDUAL CHICKEN PIES ALL READY TO BAKE THAT'S THE POINT READY TO BAKE 
MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH GO OUT TO WORK BIRDSEYE PIES ARE SUCH A HELP 
IT'S CONVENIENT BUT BECAUSE MRS. DOBSON BAKES IT HERSELF SHE FULFILS HER WIFELY DUTIES 
A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS WERE ADVERTISED 
WHICH ENABLED HER TO BE A GOOD PROVIDER WITHOUT HAVING TO SPEND AGES CHOPPING AND PEELING 
A NEW KIND OF SOUP THAT ONLY NEEDED HOT WATER IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT HOME COOKED FLAVOUR 
BUT FOR MANY MARRIED WOMEN THE ROLE THEY HAD TAKEN ON WAS BECOMING UNFULFILLING 
ADVERTISERS RESPONDED BY TRYING TO MAKE HOUSEWORK WORTHWHILE AGAIN 
NOW MANY HOUSEWIVES BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE EVERY DAY 
NOW MANY HOUSEWIVES BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE EVERY DAY 
AFTER ALL THE LAVATORY IS USED EVERY DAY 
ADVERTS PROMOTED EVER GREATER STANDARDS OF CLEANLINESS NEW WAYS TO MAKE THE HOME ATTRACTIVE 
EVER MORE COMPLEX RECIPES 
IF YOU STILL WEREN'T SATISFIED THERE WEREN'T MANY ALTERNATIVES 
A FEW ASPIRATIONAL ROLES FOR YOUNG UNMARRIED WOMEN DID APPEAR IN ADVERTS 
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER I WANTED TO BE A DANCER 
BUT IN REALITY SUCH CAREERS WERE FOR THE LUCKY FEW 
FOR THE MAJORITY THE PROSPECT WASN'T AS GLAMOROUS 
WOMEN LEARNT ABOUT THEIR ROLES IN LIFE FROM AN EARLY AGE 
SOME LESSONS WERE DIFFERENT FOR BOYS AND GIRLS 
WHILE BOYS WERE DOING WOODWORK THE GIRLS WERE DOING HOME ECONOMICS 
SOME SCHOOLS EVEN PROVIDED FURNISHED FLATS FOR THE GIRLS TO PRACTISE THEIR HOMECRAFT IN 
FOR MANY PARENTS FURTHER EDUCATION FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS WOULD SEEM POINTLESS 
AFTER ALL YOU DON'T NEED A UNIVERSITY DEGREE TO KNOW THAT PERSIL WASHES WHITER 
THE SIXTIES SAW A BOOM IN THE NUMBER OF JOBS AVAILABLE TO SINGLE YOUNG WOMEN 
WHO WERE THUS ABLE TO BE SOMETHING OTHER THAN WIFE OR MOTHER 
ADVERTISERS CELEBRATED THESE NEW WOMEN AND MADE A BID FOR THEIR CASH 
MORE WOMEN WENT INTO HIGHER EDUCATION IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO THERE WERE OVER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND GIRLS AT UNIVERSITY 
LIVING AWAY FROM HOME WITH INTELLECTUAL AND FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE 
MANY EMERGED WITH GREATER EXPECTATIONS 
ELIZABETH SIDNEY READ ENGLISH AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY 
IF YOU WANT TO SUPPRESS WOMEN YOU REALLY MUSTN'T EDUCATE THEM 
THAT'S A GRAVE ERROR 
WE WERE USED TO IT IN UNIVERSITY ARGUING WITH MALE COLLEAGUES 
AND WE LOOKED AROUND AND DISCOVERED WE WERE BEING VERY BADLY TREATED 
WE WERE NOT BEING PAID PROPERLY OR GIVEN OPPORTUNITIES 
ADVERTISEMENTS CAME IN FOR HEAVY CRITICISM FOR OFFERING A LIMITED VIEW OF WHAT WOMEN COULD ACHIEVE 
AMERICAN FEMINIST BETTY FRIEDAN SAID IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE 
WOMEN ARE SHOWN SOLELY AS MAN'S WIFE MOTHER LOVE OBJECT DISHWASHER CLEANER 
AND NEVER AS A PERSON 
WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT WOMEN'S LIB 
BY THE END OF THE SIXTIES WOMEN'S RIGHTS WERE HOT NEWS 
THEY'VE GOT VOTES HUSBANDS WHAT MORE DO THEY WANT 
AS FAR AS I GATHER THEY'RE NOT TOO KEEN ON THE IDEA OF HUSBANDS 
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF OLD MADAM TO ME 
WOMEN'S LIB IS HAPPENING NOW HOW IS IT GOING TO CHANGE OUR LIVES READ THE OBSERVER TOMORROW 
WOMEN WERE MOBILISED THE WOMEN'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT WAS BORN 
TO MANY THEIR ATTITUDES SEEMED SHOCKING AND EXTREME 
THIS IS INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY TODAY AND YOU SEND A MALE TO INTERVIEW ME AND A MALE CAMERAMAN 
WHERE ARE THE B. B. C.'S WOMEN CAMERAMEN 
SOME OF THEIR DEMANDS STRUCK A CHORD WITH ORDINARY WOMEN 
IN PARTICULAR THE DEMANDS FOR EQUAL PAY AND OPPORTUNITIES 
BELIEVE ME IT WASN'T EASY 
I WENT OUT MARCHING WITH THEM FOR BETTER CONDITIONS TO BE RECOGNISED AS EQUALS TO MEN 
THE POLICE WEREN'T VERY NICE TO US THEY USED TO PUSH US AROUND A BIT 
MY HUSBAND DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT I TOLD HIM I WAS VISITING FRIENDS 
A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS A JOKE 
PEOPLE LAUGHED AT US THEY DON'T LAUGH AT US ANY MORE THEY TAKE US VERY SERIOUSLY 
WE'RE REALLY GETTING THROUGH TO THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS 
ADVERTISERS WERE UNSURE HOW TO REACT TO THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT 
WE TRAVEL INTER CITY LIKE THE MEN DO INTER CITY SITTING PRETTY ALL THE WAY 
FOR THIS ADVERTISER WOMEN'S LIB WAS O. K. AS LONG AS THEY WERE HOME IN TIME FOR THEIR HUSBANDS 
AWAY FROM THE BORING KITCHEN SINK AND NEED YOU ASK 
WE'RE LEAVING BEHIND THE DAILY ROUND OF COMMON TASKS 
COME ON AND TRAVEL INTER CITY LIKE THE MEN DO WE LOVE A LITTLE OUTING NOW AND THEN 
SO UP WITH WOMEN'S RIGHTS COME UP AND SEE THE SIGHTS WE'LL BE NICER BRIGHTER WOMEN FOR OUR MEN 
AWAY FROM IT ALL AND HOME AGAIN 
IN REALITY THE HOUSEWIFE WAS MORE RADICAL 
AND THEIR CAMPAIGNING BORE FRUIT 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THE EQUAL PAY ACT MADE IT ILLEGAL TO PAY A WOMAN LESS THAN A MAN DOING THE SAME JOB 
THE SEX DISCRIMINATION ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE MADE IT ILLEGAL TO REFUSE SOMEONE A JOB ON THE GROUNDS OF GENDER 
MEANWHILE THE IMAGES OF WOMEN IN ADVERTS WERE STILL VERY MIXED 
ONE RECURRING ICON WAS THE BIMBO 
SEEMS PRETTY CREAMY TO ME LOOK AT MY BITS OF FRUIT 
BY THE EIGHTIES WOMEN MADE IT PLAIN THAT THEY'D HAD ENOUGH 
BY NOW WOMEN WERE INCREASINGLY COMBINING MARRIAGES WITH CAREERS 
NONETHELESS THEY STILL TENDED TO DO ALL THE HOUSEWORK 
THE DOUBLE BURDEN OF A WORKING WIFE IS ACKNOWLEDGED IN THIS OXO AD 
SHE'S GOT TO WORK LATE AND HAS PRE PREPARED THE FAMILY MEAL 
HOW'S THE CASSEROLE 
A WORKING CAN COOK A ROTTEN CASSEROLE SHE HAS TO BE GOOD AT EVERYTHING 
THE REAL SUCCESS OF THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT IN MY VIEW 
HAS COME FROM THE FACT THAT THEY THE JOBS CHANGED 
THEY WERE JOBS THEY COULD DO AND EARN BIG MONEY 
WOMEN'S LIVES HAVE CHANGED RADICALLY THIS CENTURY 
THIS NINETIES WOMAN IS A WORLD AWAY FROM OXO KATIE AND HER JACKETATOES 
BUT IS THIS FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT NON DOMESTIC WOMAN JUST AN ADVERTISER'S DREAM 
THERE'S A BIG GROUP OF WOMEN WHO STILL HAVE ILL REWARDED AND ILL TREATED PART TIME JOBS 
WOMEN WHO WERE REALLY NOT SKILLED OR IN SEMI SKILLED JOBS 
THEY WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HEAP AND REMAIN THERE 
WOMEN ARE STILL THE PRIME TARGETS OF ADVERTISING 
AS YOU WATCH T. V. TONIGHT TRY TO EVALUATE THE ADVERTS THAT YOU SEE 
FREEDOM TO BE THE WOMAN YOU ARE 
ARE THEY RELIABLE EVIDENCE FOR FUTURE HISTORIANS 
ARE THEY ANY MORE ACCURATE IN THEIR PORTRAYAL OF REAL WOMEN'S LIVES THAN ADVERTS FROM THE PAST 
THIS EPISODE OF HISTORY FILE WAS PRODUCED IN CARDIFF BY B. B. C. WALES 
IT WAS DEVISED AND CREATED BY THIS ESPECIALLY ASSEMBLED TEAM OF ACTORS MUSICIANS DESIGNERS 
TECHNICIANS AND PROGRAMME MAKERS 
AND NARRATED BY ME JULIET STEVENSON 
THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER WAS MR. DAI WILLIAMS WOTCHA 
ALL THINGS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL 
THIS PROGRAMME IS ABOUT POVERTY 
WE WILL LOOK AT THE PERSISTENCE OF POVERTY 
AND HOW GOVERNMENTS HAVE TRIED TO DEAL WITH IT IN THE LAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
ALTHOUGH BRITAIN AT THIS TIME WAS A VERY WEALTHY COUNTRY ONLY A SMALL MINORITY OF THE PEOPLE WERE RICH 
OUT OF EVERY ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE 
TWO OR THREE WERE LIVING IN THE LAP OF LUXURY WHILE TWENTY FIVE OR MORE WERE LIVING IN DIRE POVERTY 
THE GULF BETWEEN THESE TWO WORLDS WAS HUGE 
FEW PEOPLE IN THE REST OF SOCIETY HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT THE REALITY OF POVERTY 
ONE MAN WHO DETERMINED TO FIND OUT WAS BENJAMIN SEEBOHM ROWNTREE 
HIS FAMILY HAD GROWN RICH MAKING CHOCOLATE 
AND PUT THE FORTUNE TO GOOD USE BY RESEARCHING POVERTY IN YORK 
HE FOUND LARGE FAMILIES WITH AS MANY AS TEN CHILDREN CRAMMED INTO SINGLE ROOMS IN SMALL DAMP HOUSES 
DISEASE WAS RIFE 
A QUARTER OF ALL CHILDREN IN YORK'S SLUMS DIED BEFORE THE AGE OF ONE 
FOR THE BREADWINNER EMPLOYMENT WAS CASUAL 
YOU COULD BE HIRED AND FIRED AT WILL AND THE PAY WAS LOW 
TO SUPPLEMENT INCOME CHILDREN AND THEIR MOTHERS OFTEN WORKED RATHER THAN GO TO SCHOOL OR STAY AT HOME 
THEIR WAGES WOULD HAVE BEEN PITIFUL 
ROWNTREE WAS APPALLED BY WHAT HE FOUND 
IF THERE WAS NO WORK POOR FAMILIES WOULD OFTEN HAVE TO RAISE MONEY BY PAWNING THEIR POSSESSIONS 
PAWNSHOPS WITH THEIR CHARACTERISTIC SIGN OF THREE BRASS GLOBES 
WERE A COMMON SIGHT IN POOR AREAS 
THEY MADE A PROFIT OUT OF POVERTY 
PEOPLE WOULD HAND OVER VALUABLE ITEMS SCRAPS OF JEWELLERY OR THE SUNDAY BEST SUIT 
IN EXCHANGE THEY'D BE GIVEN MONEY AND A TICKET FOR EVERY ITEM PAWNED 
ONCE THE FAMILY HAD A BIT OF MONEY AGAIN 
THEY COULD GET THEIR GOODS BACK BY REPAYING THE LOAN WITH INTEREST 
THE POOR EXPERIENCED PARTICULAR HARDSHIP AT LEAST THREE TIMES IN THEIR LIVES 
BECAUSE THIS BOY WAS BORN INTO A LARGE FAMILY WITH MANY MOUTHS TO FEED 
HIS EARLY YEARS WERE SPENT IN POVERTY 
AS HE GREW UP AND BEGAN TO EARN THINGS IMPROVED FOR HIM 
UNTIL HE BEGAN TO HAVE HIS OWN LARGE FAMILY 
ONCE AGAIN TIMES BECAME HARD 
FINALLY IN OLD AGE IF HE LIVED THAT LONG 
POVERTY WOULD STRIKE HIM AGAIN 
ROWNTREE'S REPORT SHOCKED SOCIETY 
AND PROMPTED THE FIRST MEASURES BY A GOVERNMENT TO DEAL WITH POVERTY 
CALLED THE LIBERAL REFORMS 
FOR CHILDREN SCHOOL MEALS AND MEDICAL CHECKS 
FOR THOSE OVER SEVENTY A PENSION OF FIVE SHILLINGS A WEEK 
FOR THE WORKING MAN SICKNESS AND UNEMPLOYMENT PAY 
IRONICALLY THE FIRST WORLD WAR DID MORE TO ALLEVIATE POVERTY THAN ANY LAWS 
THE HUGE DEMAND FOR MANPOWER IN THE ARMY AND IN THE INDUSTRIES WHICH SUPPLIED THEM 
WIPED OUT UNEMPLOYMENT RAISED WAGES 
AND BETTERED LIVING CONDITIONS FOR MILLIONS OF WORKING CLASS FAMILIES 
THE WAR ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF POVERTY 
SUCH WAS THE POOR HEALTH OF THE WORKING CLASSES THAT OF TWO MILLION MEN WHO WERE CALLED UP IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN 
OVER ONE MILLION WERE UNFIT FOR FULL MILITARY DUTIES 
WITH THE WAR OVER FULL EMPLOYMENT ENDED 
HOPES FOR A BETTER WORLD THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND WORK WERE SOON DASHED 
THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED BY ROWNTREE PERSISTED 
ANDY WAUDBY GREW UP IN THE SLUMS OF YORK IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
THERE WAS NO WALLPAPER ON THE WALLS AND YOU COULD LAY BACK IN BED 
AND WATCH THE BUGS WALKING UP THE WALLS 
THE WAUDBY FAMILY SURVIVED ON A DIET OF STALE FOOD AND SCRAPS 
MY MOTHER AND I WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO EAT 
UNTIL MY DAD HAD HAD HIS 
WE HAD TO HAVE WHAT WAS LEFT 
MEAT ON THE PLATE WAS SOMETHING TO REMEMBER 
SHEEP'S HEADS AND SHEEP'S HEADS WERE PUT IN A STEW IN THE PAN 
WE USED TO SAY IF YOU LEAVE THE EYES IN IT'LL SEE YOU THROUGH THE WEEK 
THE ONLY SURVIVING PHOTOGRAPH OF ANDY AS A CHILD TAKEN IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE 
HAS THE TITLE HAPPY DAYS 
BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT FOR PEOPLE LIKE ANDY 
DEATH AND DISEASE WERE A WAY OF LIFE 
MY AUNT SHE HAD A LITTLE DAUGHTER CALLED LOUIE 
EVEN TO THIS DAY I CAN REMEMBER GOING INTO THE HOUSE TO SEE MY AUNT EMMA 
ON THE KITCHEN TABLE THEY USED TO PUT THE COFFINS ON THE KITCHEN TABLE 
AND I SAW LITTLE LOUIE IN THE COFFIN ON THE TABLE 
THAT'S WHAT THEY USED TO DO 
BY THE NINETEEN THIRTIES BRITAIN WAS IN THE GRIP OF AN ECONOMIC SLUMP 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY TWO TWENTY TWO PER CENT OF THE POPULATION WERE OUT OF WORK 
THE LIBERAL REFORMS WERE NEVER DEVISED TO COPE WITH HARDSHIP ON SUCH A VAST SCALE 
THE GOVERNMENT WAS HARD PRESSED TO PAY OUT SO MUCH DOLE MONEY AND SOUGHT WAYS TO CUT IT BACK 
BEFORE A FAMILY COULD RECEIVE ANY DOLE 
AN ASSESSMENT WAS MADE TO SEE HOW NEEDY THEY WERE 
THIS WAS KNOWN AS THE MEANS TEST 
INSPECTORS WOULD VISIT THE HOUSE AND MAKE AN ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT THE FAMILY COULD RAISE 
FOR EXAMPLE BY THE SALE OF FURNITURE CONSIDERED INESSENTIAL 
THIS SUM WOULD BE DEDUCTED FROM THEIR BENEFIT 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS WERE DISALLOWED 
SAVING THE GOVERNMENT MILLIONS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE POOREST IN SOCIETY 
THE MEANS TEST BECAME A SOURCE OF GREAT BITTERNESS 
THE DECADE WAS MARKED BY HUNGER MARCHES VIOLENCE AND A DIVIDED NATION 
IT'S BEEN SO BAD AT TIMES FOR MEN NOT TO GET A JOB 
BECAUSE OF CUTTING THEIR THROATS COMMITTING SUICIDE 
ALL THINGS WISE AND WONDERFUL 
THE LORD GOD MADE THEM ALL 
THE WRITER GEORGE ORWELL SPENT SOME TIME LIVING IN WORKING CLASS AREAS 
IN ORDER TO SEE AT FIRST HAND THE EFFECTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT 
IT IS A DEADLY THING TO SEE A SKILLED MAN RUNNING TO SEED YEAR AFTER YEAR IN HOPELESS IDLENESS 
SEVERAL MILLION MEN IN ENGLAND WILL UNLESS ANOTHER WAR BREAKS OUT 
NEVER HAVE A REAL JOB THIS SIDE OF THE GRAVE 
ORWELL WAS RIGHT WAR SOLVED THE UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS AT A STROKE 
EVERYONE WAS NEEDED AGAIN 
RATIONING ENSURED THAT EVERYONE HAD THE SAME TO EAT 
PEOPLE BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT REBUILDING A BETTER BRITAIN AFTER THE WAR 
I WAS THINKING ABOUT GAPS BETWEEN HOUSES WHAT COMES DOWN MUST GO UP 
NOT LIKE IT USED TO BE WITH THOSE SLUMS AND TENEMENTS 
THE JOB'S GOT TO BE DONE DECENTLY 
IF WE CAN WORK TOGETHER NOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AFTERWARDS TO CLEAR UP THE MESS 
AND BUILD A BETTER WORLD SO THESE THINGS CAN'T HAPPEN I'LL SECOND THAT 
THE TASK OF DRAWING UP A BLUEPRINT FOR THE FUTURE FELL TO WILLIAM BEVERIDGE 
THIS NEW BRITAIN NEEDED A BIG IDEA TO COPE WITH LONG TERM UNEMPLOYMENT AND KILL OFF THE POVERTY CYCLE 
THE BEVERIDGE SOLUTION AIMED TO GIVE EVERYONE ECONOMIC SECURITY FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE 
THROUGH A NATIONAL INSURANCE SCHEME 
WE SHALL TAKE THE FIRST STEP TO SECURITY 
WITH FREEDOM AND RESPONSIBILITY 
THAT IS WHAT WE ALL DESIRE 
THERE WAS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT 
FOR THE BEVERIDGE PLAN AND THE NINETEEN FORTY FIVE LABOUR GOVERNMENT MADE IT A REALITY THE WELFARE STATE WAS BORN 
BLUE SKIES SMILING AT ME 
NOTHING BUT BLUE SKIES 
IMPROVED PENSIONS FOR ALL 
FREE SECONDARY EDUCATION FOR ALL 
AND A FREE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE FOR ALL 
BEVERIDGE WAS A TONIC TO THE NATION 
BUT THE BATTLE TO CLEAR THE BOMB DAMAGED HOUSING AND SLUMS HAD YET TO BE WON 
ROW UPON ROW OF DIRTY HOUSES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PULLED DOWN LONG AGO 
HOMES WITHOUT ANY PROPER SANITATION 
WHERE ALL THE WATER IS CARRIED UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS IN BUCKETS 
AND THE COOKING STOVE IS ON THE STAIRWAY LANDING 
HOMES WHERE WHOLE FAMILIES LIVE EAT AND SLEEP ALL TOGETHER IN ONE ROOM 
JOHN BIRD GREW UP IN CONDITIONS LIKE THIS IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES IN LONDON 
THERE WAS VERY BAD SANITATION 
THERE WAS OUTSIDE TOILETS SHARED BY TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE 
WE LIVED IN A FRONT ROOM 
AND MY PARENTS USED TO SLEEP IN THE KITCHEN WHICH WAS OUT THE BACK 
AND MY BROTHERS AT THE TIME I WAS BORN I HAD TWO ELDER BROTHERS 
THEY SLEPT ON THE FLOOR BY THE WINDOW AND I SLEPT BETWEEN TWO ARMCHAIRS 
I REMEMBER SLIPPING DOWN THE MIDDLE 
I USED TO THINK I WISH MY PARENTS WOULD GET ME OUT OF THIS 
LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHERS JOHN AND HIS FAMILY EVENTUALLY GOT INTO BETTER HOUSING 
AS THE NATION GOT WEALTHIER 
THE SLUMS CHILD MORTALITY AND STARVATION DIETS BECAME A THING OF THE PAST 
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES IT WAS THOUGHT POVERTY WAS BEATEN 
BY THE NINETEEN NINETIES IT'S CLEAR THAT WAS WRONG 
CHANGES IN SOCIETY HAVE CAUSED NEW FORMS OF POVERTY 
WORK FOR UNSKILLED PEOPLE HAS BECOME MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND IN A TECHNOLOGICAL AGE 
SINGLE PARENTS FELL THROUGH BEVERIDGE'S SAFETY NET 
AS HIS REFORMS HAD ONLY BEEN DESIGNED TO HELP THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY UNIT 
IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE CHILD POVERTY ACTION GROUP PRODUCED A REPORT 
THE FINDINGS WERE STARTLING 
THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE MOST OF THEM WOMEN 
AND ONE IN FOUR CHILDREN WERE FOUND TO BE LIVING IN POVERTY TODAY 
THE DESTITUTION OF THE ROWNTREE DAYS HAD GONE 
BUT THEY FOUND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHOSE LIVING STANDARDS FELL FAR BELOW WHAT WE EXPECT TODAY 
AS ONE YOUNG MOTHER SAYS 
SINGLE PARENT CATH LEIPER SLEEPS DOWNSTAIRS SO THAT HER SIX CHILDREN CAN HAVE THE BEDS 
SUCH AS THEY ARE 
IT'S VERY HARD TO SURVIVE 
ON INCOME SUPPORT WITH SIX CHILDREN THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO GO ROUND 
IT GOES ON GAS ELECTRIC AND FOOD 
I'D RATHER BE OUT WORKING TO SUPPORT MY CHILDREN THAN TO HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE'S MONEY SUPPORTING MY CHILDREN 
BUT POVERTY TODAY IS NOT JUST A QUESTION OF MONEY IT'S ALSO ABOUT A LACK OF OPPORTUNITY 
YOU GET INTO THIS FEELING THAT YOU'VE GOT NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
YOU'RE JUST A PIECE OF SOCIAL TRASH A PIECE OF RUBBISH 
AND YOU LOSE EVERYTHING 
I KNOW LOTS OF POOR PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT BOIL AN EGG FOR THEMSELVES 
JOHN BIRD ESCAPED THE POVERTY TRAP 
HE RUNS THE BIG ISSUE A SUCCESSFUL MAGAZINE DESIGNED TO HELP THE HOMELESS HELP THEMSELVES 
PEOPLE WHO TEN TWENTY THIRTY ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO COULD HAVE CLIMBED OUT OF THEIR POVERTY 
BECAUSE THERE WERE PATHWAYS OUT OF POVERTY 
THOSE PATHWAYS HAVE BEEN BLOCKED BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF UNSKILLED WORK AROUND 
AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF PEOPLE ARE BECOMING USELESS IN SOCIETY BECAUSE BUSINESSES DON'T WANT THEM ANY MORE 
IN NINETEEN OH FIVE A TIMES EDITORIAL WARNED OF RELYING TOO MUCH ON GOVERNMENT HELP 
TO SORT OUT THE PROBLEM OF POVERTY 
WE HAVE ALREADY RELIEVED PARENTS OF THE DUTY OF EDUCATING THEIR CHILDREN 
THIS IS NOW USED AS AN ARGUMENT FOR RELIEVING THEM OF THE DUTY OF FEEDING THEIR CHILDREN 
WHAT ARE WE TO EXPECT THE HABIT OF LOOKING TO THE STATE FOR MAINTENANCE WOULD BE INGRAINED IN THEM 
WITHOUT STATE INTERVENTION THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO END TO THE SQUALOR AND DISEASE OF THIS CENTURY 
BUT TODAY MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE WE HAVE GONE TOO FAR AND CREATED A NANNY STATE 
CAN FUTURE GOVERNMENTS DO ANY BETTER THAN THOSE OF THE PAST 
AND IF NOT WHAT WILL BE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR SOCIETY 
IF YOU WANT SOCIAL PEACE WHERE THE STREETS ARE SAFE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOCIAL JUSTICE 
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT SOCIAL JUSTICE YOU CAN'T HAVE SOCIAL PEACE

AND NARRATED BY ME JULIET STEVENSON 
THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER WAS MR. DAI WILLIAMS WOTCHA 
WARTIME CHILDREN'S LIVES WERE LIT BY SURPRISES 
BETWEEN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND NINETEEN FIFTY ONE WE SAW OUR FIRST BANANAS WASHING MACHINES 
AND OUR FIRST TELEVISION SETS 
WE GOT ANGRY AT OUR ELDERS' APATHY AND DISILLUSIONMENT 
THEY FORGOT THAT FOR US IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BRAVE NEW WORLD 
FIVE YEARS AFTER THE WAR CHANGE WAS IN THE AIR 
PEOPLE WANTED TO FORGET THE WARTIME DISRUPTION AND POST WAR AUSTERITY 
COULD PROSPERITY AND PEACE BE ACHIEVED 
SOUTH KOREA WAS OVERRUN BY THE ARMIES OF THE COMMUNIST NORTH 
IT WAS A PLACE FEW BRITONS HAD EVER HEARD OF 
BUT THE WAR SOON INVOLVED THE WORLD 
I DECLARE THE FESTIVAL OPEN AND WISH IT SUCCESS 
THE NINETEEN FIFTIES STARTED WITH BRITAIN SCARRED FINANCIALLY BY THE WAR 
SHORTAGES MADE LIFE DIFFICULT OFTEN EXASPERATING 
A COAL SHORTAGE CUT TRAIN SERVICES 
A STEEL SHORTAGE CLOSED THE CAR FACTORIES 
THERE WAS A SERIOUS HOUSING SHORTAGE 
THERE'S ME MY HUSBAND AND ONE IN THE COT 
AND TWO IN THERE WHEN IT'S OVER WARM 
I PUT THEM TOGETHER WHEN IT'S VERY COLD 
AUSTERITY GAVE WAY TO AFFLUENCE 
WAGES ROSE BY TWENTY PER CENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT WAS VIRTUALLY NIL 
THE NEW WELFARE STATE OFFERED SECURITY FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE 
NEVER BEFORE HAVE PEOPLE REACHED SUCH A STANDARD OF PROSPERITY 
THEY EARN HIGH WAGES AND HAVE MONEY TO SPEND ON THE LUXURIES OF LIFE 
THEY DEMAND AND GET THINGS LIKE TELEVISIONS IN COUNCIL HOUSES 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS GET MOTORCYCLES TEENAGE GIRLS WEAR SMART FROCKS 
I THINK OF THE OLD DAYS WITH LOW WAGES POOR FOOD AND SHABBY CLOTHES 
MANY LIVED IN SLUMS WITH NO WATER AND BAD DRAINAGE 
THE BRITISH SHRUGGED OFF OLD ATTITUDES TO BORROWING MONEY 
THE FIFTIES SAW HIRE PURCHASE DEBTS RISING AT THEIR FASTEST LEVELS 
HIRE PURHASE OR CASH HIRE PURHASE PLEASE 
HOW MUCH DEPOSIT ROUGHLY THIRTY 
THAT GETS YOU ONE HUNDRED FIFTY WORTH OF GOODS 
ONE IN THREE HOUSEHOLDS IS BUYING SOMETHING ON H. P. 
ONE IN TWO T. V.'S IS BOUGHT ON H. P. ONE IN THREE RADIOS IS BOUGHT ON H. P. 
ONE IN FIVE NEW CARS IS ON H. P. 
THREE MILLION NEW HOUSES WERE BUILT 
BY THE END OF THE DECADE THERE WERE ONE THOUSAND NEW HOUSES EVERY DAY 
MODERN HOUSES BRING MANY NEW ADVANTAGES 
HOT WATER LIVING SPACE BATHROOMS 
THIS IS THE FUTURE 
THE COUNTRY HAS NEVER BEEN SO PROSPEROUS 
THE STANDARD OF LIVING HAS GONE UP 
WE'RE BETTER FED BETTER CLOTHED WE'RE USING MORE ELECTRICITY 
PEOPLE HAVE CARS BICYCLES OTHER THINGS 
WHICH ONLY RECENTLY WERE LUXURIES OF THE FEW 
THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WERE THE FIRST PERIOD OF MASS AFFLUENCE 
AFTER THE AUSTERITY AND RATIONING OF THE NINETEEN FORTIES 
MANY PEOPLE COULD ENJOY NEW CONSUMER GOODS LIKE TELEVISIONS AND FRIDGES 
BEFORE THIS POINT THEY'D BEEN RESTRICTED TO A FEW WEALTHY PEOPLE 
BUT THERE WERE STILL PROBLEMS 
THERE WERE GROUPS LIKE THE ELDERLY AND SINGLE PARENT FAMILIES 
THEY LIVED ON THE POVERTY LINE AS YET UNHELPED BY THE WELFARE STATE 
BRITAIN WAS GROWING BUT THERE WERE SIGNS IT WASN'T GROWING FAST ENOUGH 
PEOPLE NOTICED POOR PRODUCTIVITY AND BAD INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 
IT MADE BRITAIN LESS EFFECTIVE THAN HER INTERNATIONAL TRADING RIVALS 
EDMUND HILLARY FROM NEW ZEALAND 
TENZING NORGAY SHERPA FROM NEPAL THEY CONQUERED EVEREST IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE 
A QUEEN IS CROWNED AS HER PEOPLE WATCH THROUGHOUT THE LAND 
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN GOD SAVE THE QUEEN 
JUST LOOK AND YOU CAN SEE THESE YOUNGSTERS ARE REALLY WITH IT 
WITH TEENAGERS I FLINCH AT THE IDEA OF TREADING THAT GROUND AGAIN 
I SHAN'T TRY TO REACH A PROFOUND CONCLUSION 
WE JUST HOPE TO OBSERVE A NEW TYPE OF TEENAGER 
ONE WHO'S MAKING MORE MONEY THAN THEY USED TO 
THEY HAVE A NEW SPENDING POWER AND ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DIFFERENT WAY 
UNEMPLOYMENT DIDN'T EXIST IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX THERE WERE TEN VACANCIES PER PERSON 
THOSE AGED BETWEEN FIFTEEN TO TWENTY WERE IN HIGH DEMAND 
TEENAGERS CAN BE TRAINED TO EARN EIGHT OR TEN A WEEK 
THE SHOPS ALL HAVE TEENAGE DEPARTMENTS 
PROVIDING DISTINCTIVE FASHIONS 
OUT WENT TWIN SETS AND PEARLS IN CAME STILETTOS AND RADIOS 
MALE FASHION ONCE WHAT DAD WORE NOW BURST INTO THE MARKETPLACE 
THE GENERATION GAP WIDENED 
TEENAGERS HAD DIFFERENT LIFESTYLES PARTICULARLY IN AREAS LIKE MUSIC 
SHAKE RATTLE AND ROLL BY BILL HALEY AND HIS COMETS 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX BILL HALEY'S FILM ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK HIT BRITAIN 
THE OLDER GENERATION WERE APPALLED THE FILM WAS BANNED IN MANY TOWNS 
THIS WAS THE YOUTHQUAKE 
AWAY FROM CITIES THE TEENAGERS OF JOURNALISTS HARDLY EXISTED 
BUT THE RULES OF THE OLDER GENERATION WERE CHALLENGED 
THE END OF MEAT RATIONING THE END OF WARTIME FOOD DISTRIBUTION 
THE FOURTEEN YEAR STORY TOLD BY THIS BOOK WAS OVER 
AND SHE SAID I USE PERSIL MY HANKIE IS WHAT I'D CALL WHITE 
AND IT WAS WHITER THAN MINE 
I ALWAYS THOUGHT MY WHITES WERE WHITE 
WHITE'S WHITE BUT PERSIL'S WHITER 
MONDAY HOW I HATE THE SIGHT OF WASHING 
I ENJOYED IT BEFORE I WAS MARRIED 
THIS HOUSEHOLD WASH IS DRUDGERY 
STILL IT'S GOT TO BE DONE 
AFTER ALL THEIR WARTIME WORK WOMEN WERE PUSHED BACK INTO THE HOME 
THE FIFTIES WERE THE DECADE OF THE IDEAL FAMILY 
THE ROLE OF WOMEN AS WIVES AND MOTHERS 
WAS SEEN AS VITAL TO REGAIN PRE WAR VALUES 
I LIKE TO BE HOME IN TIME TO CHANGE SO HE SEES ME AT MY BEST 
IF I HURRY I SHALL HAVE TIME FOR A DOZE BEFORE THINKING ABOUT SUPPER 
THE GOODS ADVERTISED ENFORCED THE IDEA OF WOMEN STAYING AT HOME 
BUT HOW COULD THEY AFFORD THEM UNLESS THEY WORKED 
DESPITE THE PRESSURE TO STAY AT HOME 
WOMEN WORKED MORE THAN EVER BEFORE 
EXPECTATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES 
CAN I JUST SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO ME 
DURING MY PERIOD OF OFFICE 
I WISH MY SUCCESSOR LUCK AND GOD'S PEACE TO YOU ALL 
WILL YOU SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO GOVERN THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM 
CANADA AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND 
AT THE QUEEN'S CORONATION BRITAIN RULED ONE OF THE LARGEST EMPIRES 
THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN 
ACCORDING TO THEIR LAWS AND CUSTOMS I SOLEMNLY PROMISE SO TO DO 
BUT WITHIN TWENTY YEARS IT WAS REPLACED BY FORTY INDIVIDUAL STATES 
IT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST ABDICATIONS OF POWER IN HISTORY 
THE WRITING WAS ON THE WALL 
FOR THE BRITISH EMPIRE AFTER NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
THE COUNTRY WAS BANKRUPT DEFENDING AN EMPIRE SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE 
IT WAS HARD ENOUGH TO SAVE BRITAIN FROM BANKRUPTCY 
IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN WHEN INDIA WAS LET GO IT SEEMED THE REST MUST SURELY FOLLOW 
BRITAIN TRIED TO BEAT AN ORDERLY RETREAT FROM ASIA AND AFRICA 
THE IDEA OF EMPIRE SEEMED OBSOLETE AND OUT OF DATE 
THIS WAS THE WORLD OF THE NEW SUPERPOWERS THE U. S. A. AND U. S. S. R. 
THE BRITISH EMPIRE WAS BOUND TO COLLAPSE 
THROUGH THE COMMONWEALTH BRITAIN SOUGHT A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE OLD EMPIRE AND THE POST WAR WORLD 
ELVIS HAS EMBARKED ON FOREIGN SERVICE IN GERMANY 
HAVE YOU HAD A ROUGH TIME BECAUSE OF YOUR PAST CAREER 
NO I WAS SURPRISED I'VE NEVER MET A BETTER GROUP OF BOYS IN MY LIFE 
WHAT IT MEANT TO BE AN IMPERIAL POWER WAS BROUGHT HOME 
WHEN CITIZENS OF THE EMPIRE USED THEIR RIGHT TO LIVE IN BRITAIN 
IN TRINIDAD WHERE I WAS BORN 
BRITISH MISSIONS SHOWED FILMS OF WHITES WELCOMING BLACKS TO BRITAIN 
IT WAS AFTER THE WAR 
WHEN THE CRY WAS TO COME AND HELP REBUILD THE MOTHER COUNTRY 
THE STREETS OF LONDON WERE SAID TO BE PAVED WITH GOLD 
MOST PEOPLE CAME THINKING THEY'D STAY FOR FIVE YEARS GET SOME MONEY 
AND RETURN TO THEIR BIRTH COUNTRIES 
SOME ARE STILL HERE THEY HAVEN'T RETURNED 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ARRIVED FROM THE WEST INDIES BETWEEN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT AND NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT 
AFTER THE INITIAL SHOCK OF THE COLD CLIMATE 
MANY FACED PREJUDICE FROM THE WHITE POPULATION 
DISAPPOINTMENT AND DISILLUSIONMENT WERE THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SETTLER 
ASKED A WOMAN FOR A LODGING 
SHE LOOKED ME IN THE EYE 
POINTED TO A LITTLE NOTICE 
NO COLOUREDS NEED APPLY 
HOUSING WAS A PROBLEM 
WE SAW NOTICES WHICH READ 
ROOMS AND FLATS TO LET NO CHILDREN NO IRISH NO DOGS 
NO COLOUREDS 
WHEN WE TELEPHONED AND MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO GO 
THE LANDLORD WOULD SAY YES WE'VE GOT A ROOM 
WHEN THEY SAW A BLACK FACE 
IF YOU DIDN'T GO WHEN THEY LET YOU KNOW YOU WEREN'T REQUIRED 
THEY'D THROW WATER AT YOU OR SPIT AT YOU OR CALL THE POLICE 
SO WE HAD TO LEAVE WE HAD TO LEAVE 
IT WAS DISAPPOINTING IT CONFLICTED WITH THE IMAGERY OF WHITE PEOPLE 
WELCOMING BLACK PEOPLE INTO THEIR HOMES 
IT WAS A SAD DISAPPOINTMENT FOR US 
MOST OF THE WEST INDIAN SETTLERS WERE IN THEIR TWENTIES 
THEY HAD PLENTY TO OFFER 
MANY WERE SKILLED WORKERS 
THEY OFTEN HAD LOW STATUS JOBS 
EMPLOYMENT WAS ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM 
THE COMPANIES WHO DIDN'T WANT BLACK PEOPLE 
HAD VACANCY CARDS STAMPED NCP 
IT DIDN'T MEAN NATIONAL CAR PARK 
IT MEANT NO COLOURED PERSON 
WITH OUR SKILLS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET JOBS ALONG THOSE LINES 
THERE WERE PEOPLE BETTER QUALIFIED THAN ME 
PROFESSIONALS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES 
THEY SWEPT THE STREETS THE RAILWAY STATIONS 
THEY WORKED AS PORTERS 
IT WAS DEMEANING 
CLARENCE THOMPSON WAS A SKILLED TECHNICIAN 
BUT HE FOUND NO SKILLED WORK 
HE BECAME A LABOURER ON A BUILDING SITE 
YOU COULDN'T GET PROMOTION 
YOU GOT LESS PAY YOU GOT CALLED NAMES 
IF YOU REACTED TO THAT 
THEY SAID YOU HAD A CHIP ON YOUR SHOULDER 
PEOPLE WERE TOTALLY INSULTING BUT WE HAD NO RIGHTS TO SAY IT'S UNFAIR 
WE COULDN'T SAY THAT WE HAD TO BE VERY TOLERANT 
MANY IMMIGRANTS WERE SHOCKED AT THE LEVEL OF RACISM THEY ENCOUNTERED 
THEY WON'T MOVE WHEN YOU WALK PAST THEM IN THE STREET 
THEY WON'T WORK AND IF YOU LIVE BY THEM THEY'RE MORE NUISANCE STILL 
IN THE PUBS THE BARTENDER WOULDN'T SERVE YOU 
AND IF YOU WENT IN WITH A WHITE PERSON WHO ORDERED THE DRINKS 
THE BARTENDER WOULD BREAK THE GLASS YOU USED RATHER THAN WASH IT 
IN THE DANCE HALLS COLOURED MEN ARE NOT ENCOURAGED 
IF YOU WERE WITH A WHITE WOMAN SHE WAS CALLED A PROSTITUTE 
THEY SAID THAT NO DECENT WHITE WOMAN WOULD GO OUT WITH A BLACK MAN 
I FELT PRETTY BITTER 
I FELT TOTALLY BETRAYED BY THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE SAW 
IN THE CARIBBEAN WE SAW BRITAIN AS THE MOTHER COUNTRY 
WELL A MOTHER CARES FOR YOU 
SHE HEARS YOUR CRIES AND PAINS AND HELPS YOU ALONG 
THAT'S HOW WE SAW BRITAIN THEN WE FOUND THEY DIDN'T WANT BLACK PEOPLE 
THERE WAS TOTAL CONTEMPT FOR BLACK PEOPLE 
CUBANS CELEBRATED THE COLLAPSE OF THE BATISTA DICTATORSHIP 
SEVEN DAYS LATER THEY CHEERED THE ENTRY INTO HAVANA OF FIDEL CASTRO 
IN MOST CATEGORIES BRITAIN LEADS THE WAY 
THE TRIUMPH HERALD WILL DO CLOSE ON FIFTY MILES TO THE GALLON 
THERE'S THE NEW MORRIS MINI MINOR 
WITH ITS ENGINE ACROSS THE FRAME 
IT'S EASY TO SPOT THE CHANGES OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
OLD ATTITUDES SHAKEN BY THE NEW PROSPERITY 
A TEENAGE REVOLUTION A FAILING ECONOMY AND A DECLINING EMPIRE 
YET IT WAS A CONSERVATIVE DECADE 
FOR MOST ATTITUDES AND VALUES WERE THE SAME AS THE PRE WAR YEARS 
IT WAS THE NEXT DECADE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHICH MARKED THE REAL WATERSHED
