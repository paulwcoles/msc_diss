I THINK HE'S FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO COME TO TERMS WITH ONE PARISH AND 
LOTS OF DIFFERENT SEPARATE COMMUNITIES 
GUY'S BOSS BISHOP BILL IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS AND IS PLANNING A TRIP OVER 
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ANY RELATIVELY YOUNG PRIEST BUT I MEAN FOR GUY 
YOU MOVE OUT INTO THE SEA AND YOU HAVE A GROUP OF ISLANDS 
WHICH ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS DIOCESE 
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING THE ISLANDS ARE SUDDENLY OVERWHELMED BY TRAGEDY 
WHEN A POPULAR YOUNG LIFEBOATMAN COLLAPSES AND DIES 
EVERYONE IS NUMB 
NUMB WITH SHOCK AND DISBELIEF 
HERE SURROUNDED BY THE SEA 
IT'S MIDSUMMER ON THE FIVE INHABITED ISLES OF SCILLY THIRTY MILES OFF THE WEST COAST OF CORNWALL 
FOR THE HOLIDAYMAKERS IT'S A CHANCE TO GET OUT AND JUST ENJOY THE SUNSHINE 
BUT UNBEKNOWN TO MOST OF THEM THE ISLANDERS ARE STRUGGLING 
TO COME TO TERMS WITH A TRAGEDY THAT HAS ENGULFED THEM ALL 
TODAY IT'S THE FUNERAL OF THE POPULAR YOUNG LIFEBOATMAN NATHAN WOODCOCK 
WHO DIED SUDDENLY AFTER COLLAPSING AFTER A GIG RACE A FEW DAYS AGO 
MANY OF THE SHOPS ARE CLOSED BOAT TRIPS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED 
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER THE AIRPORT HAS SHUT DOWN AS A MARK OF RESPECT 
FOR THE FUNERAL OF A MAN WHO EVERYONE KNEW AND LOVED 
WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER'S FAMILIES 
SO WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS TO SOMEBODY THAT YOU KNOW 
IT REALLY BRINGS IT HOME TO EVERYBODY 
EVERYBODY'S FEELING QUITE DOWN AT THE MOMENT 
HE WAS HE WAS A GREAT GUY 
AND HE'LL BE MISSED YOU KNOW 
IT'S A REAL SHAME 
BEING HERE LAST YEAR I KNEW NATHAN FROM LAST YEAR 
BUT IT AFFECTED ME AS WELL YOU KNOW IT WAS A REALLY SAD SAD DAY 
IT'S BEEN SAD EVER SINCE 
IT'LL TAKE A LONG TIME FOR THE ISLAND TO GET OVER THAT 
IF IT EVER DOES AT ALL 
THE NEW CHAPLAIN TO THE ISLES FATHER GUY SCOTT IS UNSURE HOW BEST TO BE OF HELP 
HE KNEW NATHAN BUT NOT HIS FAMILY AND HE'S VERY AWARE OF THE TRAUMA THE TRAGEDY HAS PROVOKED 
IN SUCH A TIGHT KNIT COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY AMONGST THE YOUNG ISLAND MEN 
IT'S BEEN QUITE A YEAR HASN'T IT IT HAS IN TERMS OF THE TRAGIC AND UNEXPECTED 
AND IT'S TAKEN ITS TOLL I BELIEVE ON PEOPLE 
IT SEEMS TO HAVE HIT HIS PEERS HIS OWN AGE GROUP PARTICULARLY HARD 
WELL YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT CAN'T YOU 
SOMEONE IN THEIR EARLY TWENTIES DIES VERY SUDDENLY AND IT BRINGS YOU FACE TO FACE WITH DEATH 
YOU THINK AT THAT AGE THAT YOU'RE IMMORTAL 
BUT NO WE HAVE TO FACE DEATH AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN OUR LIVES IT'S JUST UTTER SHOCK FOR THEM 
HOW DO YOU SORT OF COPE WITH PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT 
WELL AS A PRIEST YOU ALWAYS STRUGGLE WITH THAT I DO ANYWAY 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE 
AT TIMES THERE REALLY ISN'T ANYTHING I FIND YOU CAN SAY 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO BE THERE WITH THEM AND TAKE THE ANGER 
COS THERE HAS BEEN ANGER OH A GREAT DEAL YEAH 
WHAT HAS MADE NATHAN'S SUDDEN DEATH AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THREE EVEN HARDER TO ACCEPT 
IS THAT HE WAS IN THE PEAK OF HEALTH 
IT APPEARS HIS HEART SIMPLY STOPPED BEATING 
WHAT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS SUDDEN ADULT DEATH SYNDROME 
NATHAN LEAVES A PARTNER VICKY AND A TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER MEGHAN 
CLOSE FRIENDS LIKE TOM JACKMAN WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT'S HAPPENED 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO CLAIM TO BE NATHAN'S BEST FRIEND 
WE WERE BEST FRIENDS IN FALMOUTH AND OVER HERE 
WHENEVER I'D COME BACK FROM SEA THE FIRST THING I'D DO AFTER DROPPING MY BAG OFF AT HOME 
WAS GO STRAIGHT TO THE BOATHOUSE AND SEE NATHAN I'D KNOW I WAS HOME THEN 
YOU KNOW GET DOWN AND SEE NATH TALK ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON WHAT I'D MISSED OUT ON WHEN I WAS AWAY 
YEAH THAT'S HOME I'D ALWAYS GO OFF AND HAVE COFFEE WITH HIM MOST MORNINGS 
WE KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG IN HIS GIG 
WE ROWED OVER TO ASSIST STRAIGHTAWAY 
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH EFFORT GOING INTO TRYING TO SAVE ONE PERSON'S LIFE IT REALLY WAS AMAZING 
IF YOU ASKED ME THIS TIME LAST YEAR IF YOU COULD TAKE ANYONE AWAY FROM THESE ISLANDS 
THAT WOULD HAVE A BIG EFFECT ON ME I'D SAY NATHAN 
YOU COULD ASK THAT QUESTION TO EVERY OTHER LOCAL OVER HERE 
AND HIS NAME WOULD COME UP MORE TIMES THAN ANYONE ELSE'S HE REALLY IS MISSED 
THE FUNERAL IS THE BIGGEST ON SCILLY IN LIVING MEMORY 
LARGER EVEN THAN THAT OF THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER HAROLD WILSON WHO DIED HERE TWELVE YEARS AGO 
INSTEAD OF GUY NATHAN'S FAMILY HAVE ASKED A METHODIST MINISTER 
THEY KNOW FROM THE MAINLAND TO CONDUCT THE SERVICE 
FOLLOWING TRADITION NATHAN'S BODY IS CARRIED ACROSS THE ISLAND 
TO BE BURIED IN THE LITTLE CHURCHYARD AT OLD TOWN BAY 
IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL THE ISLANDERS STRUGGLE TO RETURN TO SOMETHING RESEMBLING NORMAL LIFE 
THERE'S A LIVING THAT STILL HAS TO BE MADE 
AWAY FROM THE ISLAND'S FAMOUS BEACHES AND OUT OF SIGHT OF MANY OF THE HOLIDAYMAKERS 
THERE'S A BURGEONING LITTLE INDUSTRY ON SCILLY WHICH COULD IN TIME MAKE A BIG CONTRIBUTION 
TO THE LONG TERM FINANCIAL SECURITY OF THE ISLANDS 
IN AN ECONOMY THAT RELIES TOTALLY ON TOURISM 
THE ISLANDERS CONSTANTLY HAVE TO THINK OF NEW AND IMAGINATIVE WAYS OF TEASING MONEY OUT OF THE VISITORS 
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS MORE AND MORE OF THE LOCALS HAVE BEEN TRYING 
TO EARN A LIVING FROM ART AND CRAFT SKILLS 
THERE'S A PERFUMERY MAKING USE OF ISLAND FLOWERS RUN BY PETER HOBSON BETTER KNOWN AS PETE THE HAT 
YOU MAKE USE OF THE NATIVE FLOWERS 
AS MUCH AS I CAN I LITERALLY USE ANYTHING THAT GROWS OVER HERE 
MY MOTTO IS IF IT DOESN'T MOVE DRY IT 
SO I GO INTO THE FIELDS 
THE FIELDS OVER HERE AS SOON AS I WALK PAST THEM ALL THE FLOWERS WILT 
COS THEY KNOW I'M GOING TO NIP THEIR HEADS OFF AND USE THEM IN POTPOURRI SOAP AND ALL SORTS OF PRODUCTS 
THERE'S EVEN A STAINED GLASS WINDOW WORKSHOP RUN BY ORIEL HICKS 
WHO'S MARRIED TO BOATMAN FRASER HICKS' BROTHER STEVE 
THERE'S QUITE A THRIVING LITTLE COTTAGE INDUSTRY BEHIND THE SCENES HERE ON SCILLY 
YES THERE'S A LOT OF CRAFTSPEOPLE WHO WORK IN SCILLY AND ARTISTS OF COURSE 
YOU'VE GOT THE WHITE SAND AND THE TURQUOISE SEA 
AND THE QUALITY OF LIGHT IS VERY BRIGHT AND IT'S LOVELY TO PAINT 
YOU KNOW THE COLOURS ARE VERY INSPIRING SO THERE ARE A LOT OF CRAFTSPEOPLE HERE 
PEOPLE HERE ALSO SEEM TO BE ABLE TO MAKE VERY GOOD USE OF NATURAL MATERIALS YES YES 
THERE'S PEOPLE WHO RECYCLE THE DRIFTWOOD AND SHELLS' 
IF YOU CAN RECYCLE IT WE RECYCLE IT BECAUSE THERE'S A PROBLEM GETTING RID OF ANYTHING ON SCILLY 
ONE OF ORIEL'S BIGGEST PROJECTS TO DATE HAS BEEN THE CREATION 
OF FOUR SPECIAL MEMORIAL STAINED GLASS WINDOWS 
FOR THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CHURCH OVER ON THE ISLAND OF BRYHER 
AND SHE'S WORKING TO FINISH THE LAST ONE IN TIME 
FOR THE IMMINENT ARRIVAL OF THE BISHOP OF TRURO BISHOP BILL 
WHAT AN HONOUR TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY PUT STAINED GLASS INTO A LOCAL CHURCH THAT'S THAT BEAUTIFUL 
AND IT'LL BE THERE HOPEFULLY FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
THERE ARE OTHER DEVELOPMENTS UNDER WAY TOO 
BEHIND THE BEACH AT PORTH MELLON ON THE MAIN ISLAND OF SAINT MARY'S THERE'S A LITTLE ESTATE AGENCY 
IT'S RUN BY TIM GUTHRIE WHO AS WELL AS HANDLING THE FEW PROPERTIES THAT EVER COME ON 
TO THE MARKET ON SCILLY LOOKS AFTER THE HOLIDAY RENTALS FOR THE ISLANDERS 
OH O. K. YES ABSOLUTELY FINE YEAH NO PROBLEM AT ALL 
ABOVE HIS OFFICE THERE'S A TINY ATTIC AND IT'S HERE THAT KERI JONES 
WHO'S RECENTLY ARRIVED FROM THE MAINLAND 
HOPES TO CREATE THE WORLD'S SMALLEST RADIO STATION RADIO SCILLY 
THIS WILL BE THE ON AIR STUDIO WHERE ALL THE PROGRAMMES ARE GOING TO COME FROM 
AND THEN BACK THROUGH HERE THERE'S GOING TO BE AN OFFICE SPACE WHERE WE CAN PRODUCE THE PROGRAMMES 
WHERE WE CAN SET UP INTERVIEWS DEAL WITH ACCOUNTS OR SEND E. MAILS FROM SURE 
WHAT'S THE SCHEDULE FROM HERE THEN THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE THE STUDIO HERE IS IT 
THIS'LL BE THE STUDIO WE'VE GOT A BIG PAINT JOB THAT STARTS NEXT WEEK WE'LL ALL BE PUTTING OUR OVERALLS ON 
AND MEANWHILE TIM IS ACTUALLY CONDUCTING HIS NORMAL BUSINESS DOWNSTAIRS 
IS THAT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM NO I THINK IT'S GOING TO ADD A BIT OF EXCITEMENT TO THE OFFICE 
REALLY ABSOLUTELY I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT IT'LL BE REALLY GOOD 
RUMOUR HAS IT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE THIS GUY HIS OWN PROGRAMME ABSOLUTELY 
WELL HE'S ASKED FOR ONE AND ANYBODY WHO'S A RESIDENT ON THE ISLANDS CAN PRESENT A PROGRAMME 
I'M PREPARED TO TRAIN PEOPLE UP FOR NO FEE TO DEVELOP SKILLS ON THE ISLANDS 
TIM FOR SOME TIME HAS WANTED TO DO A CHAT SHOW HAVE YOU DECIDED WHAT SORT OF TIME SLOT YOU WANT YET 
NOT YET SO WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT 
IT'S A FEW DAYS AFTER NATHAN'S FUNERAL AND UP AT THE CHAPLAINCY 
FATHER GUY IS FACING HIS MOST DIFFICULT TASK SINCE HE ARRIVED ON SCILLY 
THE ANNUAL LIFEBOAT SERVICE IS TAKING PLACE DOWN BY THE HARBOUR AND GUY HAS TO PREACH THE SERMON 
THE TURNOUT FOR THE SERVICE IS THE BIGGEST ANYONE CAN REMEMBER 
FATHER GUY KNOWS IT'S VITAL HE READS THE MOOD OF THE CONGREGATION AND GETS THE TONE RIGHT 
MONTHS AGO WHEN I WAS FIRST TOLD THAT I'D BE PREACHING 
IT SEEMED A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD MATTER 
A QUICK SOMETHING ABOUT THE SELFLESS BRAVERY OF THOSE WHO RISK THEIR LIVES TO SAVE OTHERS IN PERIL 
EASY 
BUT EVENTS HAVE INTERVENED AND CONSPIRED TO MAKE THIS LIFEBOAT SERVICE 
AS FAR FROM STRAIGHTFORWARD AND EASY AS IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE 
AND THAT I BELIEVE 
ULTIMATELY IS NO BAD THING 
FOR IT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONFRONT AND EXPLORE 
THE DEPTHS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN 
THE RIPPLES FROM NATHAN'S DEATH 
HAVE SPREAD THROUGHOUT OUR ISLAND COMMUNITY 
AND SO MUST WE BE READY TO RESPOND 
TO THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF LIFE 
AND LIKE THE LIFEBOATS 
ALWAYS BE READY TO GO TO THE AID OF THOSE IN DISTRESS 
IT'S NOT BEEN AN EASY SERVICE FOR ANYONE 
FATHER GUY CAN ONLY HOPE HIS WORDS MAY BRING SOME COMFORT TO THE ISLANDERS 
A FEW DAYS LATER AND A VERY WELCOME FIGURE ARRIVES ON SAINT MARY'S FROM THE MAINLAND 
BISHOP BILL IS FATHER GUY'S BOSS AND THE TIMING OF HIS VISIT TO SCILLY COULDN'T BE BETTER 
IF EVER THERE WAS A MOMENT FOR A BIT OF MORALE BOOSTING THIS IS IT 
WELCOME COME IN 
HOW ARE YOU FINDING IT I MEAN IS IT MORE DIFFERENT THAN YOU'D EXPECTED IT TO BE 
YEAH WELL AS YOU'RE AWARE IF I'M PERFECTLY HONEST IT HASN'T BEEN AN EASY START 
BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY 
BECAUSE OF WHAT I'VE COME TO IT'S JUST WHAT CAME UP AS SOON AS I BEGAN MY MINISTRY HERE 
ON A DAY LIKE TODAY WITH A SMOOTH SEA IT CAN LOOK BEGUILINGLY BEAUTIFUL 
EVERYBODY'S STANDING AND EVERYONE'S HAPPY 
BUT UNDERNEATH THERE ARE QUITE STRONG UNDERCURRENTS WHICH YOU'VE GOT TO BE AWARE OF 
ANY JOB IN A WAY IS DIFFICULT BUT THERE ARE SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES HERE AREN'T THERE 
WHAT CAN APPEAR TO BE IN A BIGGER PLACE NOT REALLY VERY IMPORTANT HERE IT BECOMES A SORT OF HURRICANE 
YEAH ABSOLUTELY IN NO TIME AT ALL AND IT COMES FROM NOWHERE DOESN'T IT YEAH 
LATER THE BISHOP OF TRURO IS GUEST OF HONOUR AT A BIG EVENT TAKING PLACE DOWN ON THE BEACH 
HELLO FANCY SEEING YOU HERE I ONLY CAME HERE BECAUSE I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO BE HERE I KNOW 
BISHOP BILL'S VERY MUCH SEEN AS INSPIRATIONAL A MAN OF THE PEOPLE 
HE'S ACTUALLY HERE TO BLESS A SPECIAL SAND CHAIR 
TO HELP THE DISABLED HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THE BEACH 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING FOR BEING HERE AND FOR BEING PART OF THIS DAY 
I'M NOW GOING TO BLESS THIS SAND CHAIR 
YOU DON'T NEED BLESSING YOU'RE ALL RIGHT 
NO NO I'LL GIVE YOU A KISS INSTEAD 
SOON BISHOP BILL'S MAGIC SEEMS TO BE HAVING AN EFFECT 
YOU'RE BLOODY WELL GOING IN YOURSELF 
CAN I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION WITH GUY WHERE IS THE BISHOP THE BISHOP 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND HE'S BORROWING A TOILET 
HE'S DOING WHAT 
HE'S USING A FACILITY TO GET CHANGED IN BEFORE HE GOES INTO THE SEA IS HE GOING IN APPARENTLY 
WHAT IN SWIMMING TRUNKS APPARENTLY HE BROUGHT THEM YEP 
ESPECIALLY YEAH HE'S A BRAVER MAN THAN ME IT'S TOO COLD 
LOOK THERE HE IS THAT'S HIM 
GET JOHN TO GET THE CROWD OUT OF THE WAY SHOULD THE LADIES BE PRESENT 
SCILLY IS FAMOUS FOR ITS BEACHES BUT BECAUSE OF THE UNUSUAL ATLANTIC CURRENTS HERE 
THE SEA IS USUALLY FREEZING LOOK OUT IT'S A GREAT WHITE SHARK 
NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND EVER GOES SWIMMING 
IT'S ALL RIGHT MOLLY YOU RELAX THAT'S IT 
HIS PUBLIC DUTIES OVER FOR TODAY BISHOP BILL TRIES TO GET THE FULL STORY 
ABOUT THE STATE OF THINGS IN THE PARISH 
HE WANTS TO FIND OUT WHAT HE CAN FROM CHURCH WARDENS SUE AND FIONA 
WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN WE CAN GET THEM DO YOU 
HOW'S IT ALL GOING WITH OLD GUY IS HE COPING OUR NEW INCUMBENT 
HE SAID THE THING IS IT ISN'T CORNWALL 
NO YOU KNOW IT IS ITS OWN PLACE 
I THINK IT'S HARDER WORK THAN HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 
WELL IT'S DIFFERENT CERTAINLY DIFFERENT WORK YES 
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I LIKE COMING HERE 
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE THE PEOPLE ARE LOVELY BUT I DON'T THINK I COULD BE THE VICAR HERE WHY NOT 
BECAUSE WELL I THINK BECAUSE YOU'RE SO SORT OF IT'S GOLDFISH BOWL LIKE 
YOU KNOW THERE IS NOWHERE YOU CAN GO TO ESCAPE OR TO RELAX 
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO DO IT BUT GUY KNEW ALL THIS DIDN'T HE BEFORE HE CAME 
WELL THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING SOMETHING 
I TOLD HIM THAT AND OTHER PEOPLE TOLD HIM THAT BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WITH KIDS 
YOU TELL KIDS YOU'LL FIND THIS THIS AND THIS AND THEY SAY OH NO NO 
AND THEN OF COURSE THEY FIND OUT I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT'S HAPPENED 
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS BRYHER'S LITTLE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CHURCH 
DOWN BY THE BEACH HAS BEEN A HIVE OF ACTIVITY 
ORIEL HICKS AND HER TEAM ARE BUSY PUTTING IN THE FINAL NEW STAINED GLASS WINDOW 
READY FOR BISHOP BILL'S VISIT 
THIS BEING SCILLY THE GLASS OF THE OLD WINDOW BEING REPLACED WILL BE PUT TO GOOD USE 
THE DIAMONDS THAT ARE ON THERE NOW WE ARE GOING TO TURN INTO ANGELS

LORRAINE KELLY LOOKS LIKE HAVING A RIVAL IN LORRAINE BRUCE THE MANAGERESS OF THE ATLANTIC 
WHAT IS IT EXACTLY YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING ON RADIO SCILLY WELL TO BE HONEST WITH YOU 
I THINK I'M GOING TO BE AN AGONY AUNT RIGHT 
WHO PEOPLE CAN PHONE IN BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE A SERIOUS AGONY AUNT 
HOW CAN YOU NOT BE A SERIOUS AGONY AUNT 
I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO TAKE THAT UP WITH KERI 
HE'S COMING UP WITH SOME FUN IDEAS 
THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES 
KERI'S PERSUADED BOATMAN PHIL COLVER AND HIS MATES 
TO DO A WEEKLY COMEDY SKETCH SHOW 
THE COUNCIL DOG WARDEN MAGGIE PERKOVIC WILL BE WRITING A SOAP OPERA 
TO BE PERFORMED BY THE LOCAL AMATEUR DRAMATIC GROUP CALLED THE ISLANDERS 
WHILE DOWN AT SAINT MARY'S WHOLESALERS GUIDANCE FOR THE BIG MORAL ISSUES OF THE DAY 
WILL COME FROM BEHIND THE BOOK KEEPER'S DESK AND FATHER GUY'S CHURCH WARDEN FIONA 
WELL THEY'VE ASKED ME TO DO THOUGHT FOR THE DAY OH RIGHT YEAH I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IT INVOLVES YET 
I WON'T BE THE ONLY ONE THANK GOODNESS BUT I'M COMING UP WITH LOTS OF THOUGHTS 
THAT'S GOING TO BE QUITE A CHALLENGE ISN'T IT 
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY CHALLENGING I THINK PEOPLE MIGHT BE QUESTIONING MY MORALS BY THE END OF IT 
HE SEEMS TO WANT FUN ON THE RADIO AND HE SEEMS TO THINK 
THAT I MIGHT BE A BIT OF FUN I DON'T KNOW WHY DOES HE THINK THAT 
IT WAS OVER A BOTTLE OF WINE THAT WE WERE SITTING DISCUSSING THIS 
YOU MIGHT GET YOUR OWN CULT FOLLOWING 
YEAH THAT'S A POSSIBILITY I SUPPOSE 
I DON'T THINK SO THOUGH 
YOU COULD BECOME A SHOWBIZ LEGEND 
YEAH I DON'T THINK SO REALLY 
I'LL KEEP DRIVING THE BOAT I THINK THAT'S THE BEST WAY 
DON'T GIVE UP THE DAY JOB IS THE RIGHT WAY OF LOOKING AT IT 
NOT ONLY HAS HE JUST A FEW WEEKS TO GET THE STATION UP AND RUNNING 
BUT WITH SUCH AN INEXPERIENCED TEAM OF PRESENTERS WILL THE ISLANDERS REALLY WANT TO TUNE IN 
IT'S THE DAY OF THE ANNUAL ROUND THE ISLAND YACHT RACE 
THIS IS ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE SCILLY SUMMER SEASON 
AND NEARLY EVERY SAILING BOAT THAT CAN STILL TAKE TO THE OPEN WATERS IS PRESS GANGED INTO SERVICE 
RATHER UNFORTUNATELY THE EVENT IS COINCIDING WITH THE BISHOP'S VISIT TO THE ISLANDS 
BUT IF ANYONE THOUGHT THE SAILING WOULD DETRACT FROM HIS TRIP OVER TO BRYHER THIS MORNING 
THEY'D CLEARLY UNDERESTIMATED BISHOP BILL'S PULLING POWER 
MORNING THIS IS BISHOP BILL HIYA HI HOW ARE YOU DOING 
THE JOURNEY ACROSS FROM SAINT MARY'S TO THE MOST NORTH WESTERLY ISLAND OF THE GROUP TAKES ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES 
AND THE LURE OF THE LOVELY STAINED GLASS WINDOWS SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED ITS MAGIC 
RARELY HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE BEEN ARRIVING AT THE LITTLE CHURCH 
WITH BISHOP BILL THERE GUY SEEMS MORE RELAXED THAN HE'S BEEN FOR WEEKS 
THE RESIDENT POPULATION OF BRYHER IS ONLY ABOUT EIGHTY 
BISHOP BILL KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT A BUILDING LIKE THIS IS IN SUCH A SMALL AND REMOTE COMMUNITY 
IT'S TEMPTING TO COME INTO THIS BUILDING AND SEE THESE LOVELY WINDOWS 
AND TO GO INTO ALL SORTS OF REVERIES AND FANTASIES ABOUT THE WORLD 
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BUILDING IS FOR 
THIS BUILDING IS ABOVE ALL THE PLACE OF OFFERING 
IT'S A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE BRING THEIR LIVES ALL THE GOOD BITS AND THE BAD BITS 
ALL THE BITS THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
WE COME HERE TO BE GIVEN THE STRENGTH 
TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN 
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LIGHT CONTINUES TO COME 
AND NOW WE CAN BLESS THE WINDOWS 
THE BISHOP PUTS THE HOLY WATER TO USE IN HIS OWN INIMITABLE WAY 
THE BEAUTIFUL ISLAND JUST TO THE SOUTH OF BRYHER IS UNINHABITED 
AND THANKS TO THE RECENT HOT WET WEATHER 
IT'S NOW LUXURIATING IN A SPECTACULAR CARPET OF HEATHER 
THE BEST ANYONE CAN REMEMBER 
THIS IS SAMSON WHERE A HANDFUL OF ISLANDERS USED TO LIVE UNTIL THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
SURVIVING MAINLY ON POTATOES AND DRIED FISH 
THE PEOPLE HERE HAD TO BE FORCIBLY REMOVED FOR FEAR THEY'D STARVE 
ANOTHER ISLAND NOW UNINHABITED IS SAINT HELEN'S WHERE THE INFAMOUS PEST HOUSE WAS LOCATED 
UNDER ACT OF PARLIAMENT IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY NINE SHIPS ARRIVING IN THE CHANNEL FROM ABROAD HAD BY LAW 
TO UNLOAD ANY DISEASED SEAMEN HERE WHERE THEY'D REMAIN UNTIL THEY DIED 
SAINT HELEN'S IS ALSO THE PLACE WHERE CHRISTIANITY WAS FIRST BROUGHT TO SCILLY IN THE EIGHTH CENTURY 
ONCE A YEAR THE OLD RUINS OF THE ANCIENT CHAPEL BECOME A PLACE OF PILGRIMAGE FOR THE ISLANDERS 
THIS IS BISHOP BILL'S FINAL DUTY ON SCILLY AND AFTER ALL THE RECENT EMOTIONAL UPHEAVAL ON THE ISLANDS 
HE'S KEEN TO REMIND THEM OF THEIR CHRISTIAN ROOTS 
THERE ARE MANY MANY PLACES WHICH ARE HOLY IN THIS COUNTRY TO WHICH PEOPLE COME 
QUITE OFTEN FOR INSTANCE THEY WOULD DO IT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S DIED 
THEY WOULD ACTUALLY SAY I'M GOING TO SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE IN ORDER TO THINK ABOUT SUCH AND SUCH A PERSON 
AND YOU MAY LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT NOW 
NEXT DAY AND IT'S TIME FOR THE BISHOP TO SAY FAREWELL TO HIS REMOTEST PARISH 
HE'S DUE TO RETIRE EARLY NEXT YEAR SO THIS IS HIS LAST OFFICIAL VISIT TO SCILLY 
I HOPE ALL GOES YOU KNOW STRAIGHTFORWARDLY THANK YOU THANKS FOR COMING 
BISHOP BILL'S VISIT HAS BEEN A HUGE TONIC FOR FATHER GUY AND HIS PARISHIONERS AT A MOMENT OF CRISIS 
ONLY TIME WILL TELL HOW THEY'LL FARE WITHOUT HIM IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME 
IN THE NEXT PROGRAMME IT'S BACK TO BUSINESS WITH A VENGEANCE 
THE CASH STRAPPED VET HEIKE HITS THE JACKPOT WITH THE DISCOVERY OF A PRIVATE ZOO 
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO DEAL WITH ANY EXOTIC ANIMALS ON SCILLY 
YEAH THERE ARE LOADS ABSOLUTELY LOADS 
RETIRED SCHOOLTEACHER MARK THE BREWER TAKES ON THE BIGGEST GAMBLE OF HIS LIFE ON SCILLY 
HOW ARE YOU DOING MARK IT'S TERRIFYING 
THE POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER IS ENORMOUS 
AND ALL EYES ARE ON THE WORLD'S SMALLEST RADIO STATION 
AS THE COUNTDOWN BEGINS TO ITS HISTORIC FIRST BROADCAST 
IT'S AGAINST THE CLOCK NOW I'M JUST DREADING A COUPLE OF DAYS WITH NO SLEEP I THINK 
THEY MAY LIKE IT MORE WHEN WE GUESS THE PRICE
