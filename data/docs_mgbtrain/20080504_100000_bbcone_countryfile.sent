BIRDS 
OF THE 
ISLANDS PEOPLE COME OUT TO SEE 
THESE LITTLE BIRDS AND GO A WAY VERY HAPPY INDEED BECAUSE 
WE HAVE 
VAST NUMBERS ON 
THE ISLANDS 
MORE 
MORE FROM THE 
FROM THE FEARNS LATER 
RISING SEA 
LEVELS ARE 
CHANGING THE 
RISING SEA LEVELS ARE CHANGING THE FACE 
S. COASTLINE 
NOWHERE 
MORE SO THAN IN NORFOLK WHERE 
PROPOSALS TO ABANDON SEA DEFENCES 
ALL TOGETHER 
COULD CREATE THE 
KINGDOM'S FIRST CLIMATE REFUGEES MIRIAM HAS MORE FOR US FOR 
CENTURIES EAST ANGLIA 
HAS BEEN 
ON 
THE FRONTLINE 
IN THE 
BALLOTS TO 
DEFEND OUR 
LAND 
THE FIGHT TO 
LOW LYING 
COAST 
COULD BE 
COMING TO 
AN END 
COAST COULD BE COMING TO AN END 
HERE WHERE THE NORFOLK 
BROADS ARE 
CLOSEST TO THE COAST THESE DEFENCE 
ARE KEEPING 
THE SEA BACK FOR NOW 
BUT THE 
LATEST STUD 
ES SHOW 
BECAUSE 
OCEAN 
ARE SET 
TO RISE BY A METRE 
BEFORE 
THE END 
OF THE 
CENTURY IF THAT 
HAPPENS THE RESULT 
N. G. STORM 
HAPPENS THE RESULTING STORM SURGES WILL BE IMMENSE THE SEA WILL EASILY 
BREACH THESE DEFENCE AND FLOOD ALL 
OF THIS 
LAND FOR MILES 
VILLAGES AND 
FARMS WILL 
BE LOST IT 
DOESN'T HELP 
THAT THE 
WHOLE 
OF THE 
EAST 
SLOW Y. SINK N. G. THIS DOOMSDAY 
SCENARIO HAS FOCUSED THE MIND 
OF THE 
GOVERNMENT WHO HAVE 
ASKED NAL 
ENGLAND TO LOOK AT FUTURE OPTIONS 
OUR REPORT LOOKS AT FOUR OPTIONS FIRST Y. 
WE COULD 
DO NOTHING FIFTY EIGHT LOU 
NATURE TO TAKE ITS CORRESPOND 
COULD HOLD THE LINE WHICH MEANS 
MAINTAINING THE LINE WHICH EXTRA INVESTMENT AND NEW 
SORTS OF 
TECHNOLOGY 
RE REAT THE 
LINE OR 
WE COULD 
GO FOR LARGE 
REAT 
LARGE SCALE RETREAT 
A LARGE 
SCALE RE 
REAT 
WOULD MEAN 
SQUARE MILES 
OF LAND 
BEING 
SACRIFICED BACK 
SEA WITH NEW 
FLOOD BARRIERS BEING BUILT EIGHT 
MILES IN AND THIS MAY SEEM EXTREME 
BUT SEA 
DEFENCE COST MONEY AND 
CAN'T GUARANTEE THE FUTURE SAFETY SIX IN 
AND VILLAGES 
ANNE 
MARKS HAS 
SIX INLAND VILLAGES ANNE MARKS HAS LIVED IN WAX 
M. FOR 
FIFTEEN YEARS 
OVER 
THE 
COMING DECADES 
HER HOUSE 
BE AT RISK 
IF THE GOVERNMENT 
TO RE REAT SHE 
SAYS IF 
THE 
WAVES DO 
TO RETREAT SHE SAYS IF THE WAVES DO WASH IN SHE WON'T BE COMPENSATED AT AT NIGHT TIME YOU CAN LAY HERE AND 
THINK THE SEA 
OVER THE 
FIVE 
ZERO METRES A 
WAY 
NEVER THINK 
IT IS GOING 
TO COME IN SURELY WHEN 
YOU MOVED HERE YOU MUST HAVE ONLY A METRE 
AND A HALF 
ABOVE SEA LEVEL AND WITH CLIMATE 
SOME POINT THE SEA WAS 
A RISK TO YOUR HOME YES 
YES 
I THINK 
WE WERE 
BUT WHEN 
FIRST MOVED IN 
THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR 
SEA DEFENCE UP AND THEY 
DID PROMISE 
THAT THEY 
WOULD KEEP 
SEA DEFENCE UP SO THEREFORE IF THEY LET THE SEA IN 
I'M 
CONCERNED THEY 
SHOULD BE LIABLE 
IF 
TOWN HERE A HUGE TOWN 
IT YOU KNOW 
THEY WOULD PROTECT IT YOU KNOW BECAUSE 
AND 
QUIET AND 
THERE'S A 
FEW VILLAGES A 
FEW HOUSE THEY 
PROBABLY THINK 
IS NOT 
WORTH PROTECT N. G. AND YOU 
JUST CANNOT KEEP 
GOING IN 
AND AND 
IN 
INLAND AND 
LET THE WATER GO FURTHER 
AND FURTHER IN WHEN 
IS IT GOING 
TO 
STOP THIS AREA 
OF NORFOLK 
IS RICH 
STOP IN FERTILE SOIL FARM 
RS ARGUE 
THAT 
WE DON'T 
HAVE 
ENOUGH GOOD 
ARGUE L. 
LAND AS 
IT IS 
TO GROW FUTURE FOOD 
SO 
WE SHOULD 
FIGHT TO STOP 
THIS BECOMING PART 
OF THE 
SEABED 
CLIMATE 
CHANGE IS GOING 
TO THROW 
A WHOLE RANGE 
OF CHALLENGES 
FOR 
SOCIETY AND HOW 
WE DEAL 
WITH THE 
IM 
IMPACTS OF 
CLIMATE 
CHANGE ON 
COMMUNITIES NOT JUST HERE 
BUT ABOUT 
ELSEWHERE 
IS A 
DEBATE SOCIETY NEEDS 
TO 
HAVE WHETHER 
WE COULD COMPENSATE 
COMPENSATE 
LOOK AT 
OF ENABLING 
PEOPLE TO MOVE SOME 
SUGGESTED THAT 
PEOPLE COULD SELL 
THEIR HOUSE 
AND 
LEASE THEM BACK 
RANGE 
OF DIFFERENT 
POSSIBILITIES 
WE NEED 
THAT DEBATE 
NOW NOT IN FIFTY YEARS' TIME I 
I TRAVELLED FIFTY 
MILES DOWN THE COAST 
WHERE I 
EXPECTED TO 
FIND 
STILL MANAGING THE THREAT FROM THE 
SEA 
BUT HERE 
ON 
THE BLYTHE 
ESTUARY 
IN SUFFOLK OLD FLOOD DEFENCES BEING ABANDONED 
IT IS 
CALLED MAKING 
SPACE FOR WATER AND 
IT IS HAPPENING 
HERE THE ENVIRONMENT 
HERE THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY 
DECIDED 
IT WAS 
JUST TOO EXPENSIVE TO 
CONTINUE PROTECT 
N. G. THIS 
LAND 
LOCALS HAVE 
BEEN FORCED TO DO 
OWN SANDBAGGING ALONG THE ESTUARY 
IT IS 
A TOUGH DECISION IF THE COAST 
IS ERODING 
AND THE RISK 
IS IN REASING WHO DO 
WE PROTECT 
RURAL 
COMMUNITIES ARE 
FEELING HELP 
HELPLESS THEY SAY THEY 
ARE BEING 
FORCED TO 
DEFEND THEMSELVES 
AGAINST 
THE HOPE SEA A MAN CALLED PETER BOWING 
YUS FAMOUS 
FAMOUSLY BUILT HIS OWN DEFENCES HE TOOK ON 
THE SEA 
LIKE KING KANOUTE 
WITH A MECHANIC L. DIGGER HIS PLAN WORK 
D. FOR 
A WHILE 
UNTIL NATURAL 
WORKED FOR A WHILE UNTIL NATURAL ENGLAND 
LABELLED HIS 
CLIFF A SITE 
SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST 
STOPPED IN HIS TRACKS 
I LOVE THIS 
PLACE 
HOME MY GRANDFATHER 
RENT 
D. IT 
ORIGINAL Y. 
IN THE YEAR 
NINETEEN AND 
IT IS THE 
MOST NATURAL 
THING ON GOD S. EARTH FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO PROTECT 
THEIR HOME 
TO 
PROTECT THE THING THEY LOVE 
AND THE 
LOVE 
AREA SO 
SO WHAT 
WALK 
N. G. ON 
NOW PETER 
WAS CONSTRUCTED BY YOU AND 
YES 
YES 
TO 
AS A 
SACRIFICIAL SEA DEFENCE TO PROTECT 
THE LOCAL PROPERTIES HOW FAR 
DID IT 
THE LOCAL PROPERTIES HOW FAR DID IT STRETCH IT 
STRETCHED FRR 
STRETCH 
JUST OVER STRETCH A KILOMETRE NORTHWARDS FROM HERE METRES WIDE AT THE BASE 
OF IT 
NOW 
NOW MOST 
WORK HAS BEEN WASH 
MOST OF THAT WORK HAS BEEN WASHED AWAY 
WHEN THIS GOES THE NEXT PIECE AWAY GOES AND 
THE NEXT PIECE GOES IN NO 
TIME AT ALL 
WE WILL 
HAVE 
TIME AT ALL WE WILL HAVE PETERBOROUGH ON SEA CAMBRIDGE ON SEA AND 
BURY SAINT EDMONDS 
ON SEA WHO 
WILL BE 
TO 
HAVE NOT PUT 
MONEY 
PROTECTION AN 
AN 
MOVING COASTLINE CAN 
BE SEEN 
WHEN YOU 
TRAVEL DOWN TO 
BE SEEN WHEN YOU TRAVEL DOWN TO DUNNE YICH ONES A MAJOR PORT TOWN 
WITH A 
FABLED EIGHTEEN 
CHURCHES AND 
CHAPELS BEFORE THE SEA GOT ITS WAY DUNNE 
YICH WAS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT 
PORT ON 
THE EAST 
COAST NOW 
TINY VILLAGE IN 
THE THIRTEENTH 
CENTURY 
TINY VILLAGE IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY A MAGSIVE STORM HIT THE AREA THE RIVER 
CHANNEL THE 
PORT FELL 
OUT 
SE AND AFTER THAT THE 
OF DISUSE AND AFTER THAT THE CONTINUAL EROSION 
HAS BASICALLY RE 
TOWN 
IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN 
TO FIVE 
TO SEA 
THE 
NATIONAL TRUST IS 
RESIGNED TO 
LOSING THEIR FISHERMAN S. COTTAGES 
AND THE R. S. P. B. MAY HAVE TO RE OCATE THE 
NATURE RE 
ERVE NEXT 
DOOR 
LOOM N. G. BEHIND IS SOMETHING THAT 
WILL HAVE 
TO BE 
PROTECTED AT 
ALL 
COSTS 
I CAN'T 
IMAGE THAT YOU WON'T COSTS TRY AND 
DEFEND SIZEWELL 
A NUCLEAR 
POWER STATION SO YOU WILL HAVE SOME POINT 
FROM THE COAST 
WHERE THEY 
POINT FROM THE COAST WHERE THEY ARE GOING 
STRONGLY DEFEND D. THE 
IM ACT 
OF THOSE 
IS INTERESTING 
WHEREVER YOU 
DEFEND SOMETHING 
STRONGLY SOMETHING ELSE ALONG THE 
COAST SUFFERS 
IT 
ACTUAL Y. USUALLY SOLVE A PROBLEM 
YOU KNOCK ON A PROBLEM ELSE WHICH 
MEANS YOU 
HAVE TO 
THERE AND 
KNOCK THE 
PROBLEM ON TO 
SOMEWHERE ELSE 
WE EITHER 
DEFEND THE 
WHO'LL 
OF THE 
COASTLINE THE EAST 
WHO'LL OF THE COASTLINE THE EAST COAST FROM 
YORKSHIRE RIGHT 
ROUND TO 
COAST FROM YORKSHIRE RIGHT ROUND TO DORSET AND DEVON OR 
WE THINK 
MORE 
SENSIBLY AND SAY THE COAST HAS 
CHANGED ALWAYS CHANGED 
CONTINUE TO CHANGE 
LET'S WITH 
OUR 
MODERN SCIENCE WORK OUT HOW 
GOING TO CHANGE AND ADAPT 
SO IT 
COMES DOWN TO A HARD 
CHOICE OVER 
WHAT 
WE WANT 
TO PROTECT AND 
WE ARE PREPARED TO SPEND 
WE ARE PREPARED TO SPEND DOING IT 
GOVERNMENT POLICY 
IS TO 
HOLD THE 
GOVERNMENT POLICY IS TO HOLD THE LINE 
OF CURRENT 
SEA DEFENCE AROUND 
HERE FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS 
BUT THE 
HERE FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS BUT THE INCREASED RISK 
OF STORM 
SURGES MAY 
INCREASED RISK OF STORM SURGES MAY MAKE THIS A VERY TOUGH JOB AS GROW OVER RISING SEA 
LEVELS MORE 
AND 
MORE INDIVIDUALS 
ARE TAKING 
IT UPON 
THEMSELVES TO 
RE 
RE AIR OUR 
COASTAL DEFENCE AROUND 
FIFTEEN MILLION 
COASTAL DEFENCES AROUND FIFTEEN MILLION OF US 
LIVE NEAR 
SEA SO 
HAVE TO HAVE AN OPEN NATIONAL 
DEBATE ABOUT WHAT OUR FUTURE 
STRATEGY 
IS GOING 
TO BE 
IN 
PROTECTING THE 
U. K. AND HOW 
WE ARE 
GOING TO TREAT ANY FUTURE CLIMATE 
CHANGE REFUGEES 
CHANGE REFUGEES 
HERE ON 
THE FEARON 
ISLANDS BIRD 
COLONIES ARE PART AND PARCEL 
OF LIFE 
COLONIES ARE PART AND PARCEL OF LIFE THEY 
ARE WHAT YOU WOULD 
EXPECT 
HERE 
BUT I 
WOULD EXPECT TO SEE ELEPHANTS 
STROLLING THROUGH THE BRITISH 
COUNTRYSIDE UNLESS 
OF COURSE 
YOU 
ARE ON 
THE CHILTERN 
HILLS IN 
BEDFORDSHIRE BEDFORDSHIRE MY NAME 
IS LEE 
SAMBROOK I'M HEAD 
KEEP R. 
OF THE 
ELEPHANTS AT ZS WHIP 
WHIPSNADE ZOO EVERY WEEK 
WE LIKE 
TO 
TAKE 
THE ELEPHANTS ON WALK HERE ON 
CURRENTLY WHIPSNADE HOLDS NINE 
ELEPHANTS THREE MALES AND SIX FEMALES 
FEMALES 
STAFF 
OF SEVEN 
THAT MANAGE THEM 
THEIR JOB 
IS NOT ONLY TO KEEP 
THE ANIMALS 
CLEAN 
BUT TO 
EN ICH THEM AND BY 
DOING THAT 
WE TAKE 
THE BRANCHES OUT 
WE SET 
UP SCATTER FEEDS 
OUTSIDE EN 
LOSURES AND 
HAVING A 
LARGE TEAM 
ENABLES US 
TO DO THAT 
SAFELY AND 
GIVE THE ELEPHANTS THE 
PROPER CARE THEY NEED THE 
LIFE OF THE 
ELEPHANTS 
WOULD BE 
OF ALL 
THE BATH ROUTINE 
IN THE 
MORNING 
AS YOU 
CAN SEE 
IF YOU 
WATCH 
THEM DURING 
ROUTINE THEY 
ARE VERY 
RE 
AXED AND 
HAPPY WITH IT 
THE BABY 
LOVES THE 
WASH 
N. G. ROUTINE 
CHANCE 
FOR HIM 
TO GET EXCITE 
PLAY AND INTERACT WITH 
HIS MOTHER 
IN THE AFTERNOON 
SPEND IT 
GOING OUT 
ON 
AFTERNOON WALK 
FOR THE 
ELEPHANTS 
IS THE BEST PART 
OF THEIR 
DAY 
THOUGH THEY 
LOVE THE 
BATH THE FACT 
THEY CAN GET OUT AND ABOUT AND GRAZE 
AND BREAK THE ODD BRANCH AND CHEW ON 
IT 
IS PROBABLY 
THE BEST PART FOR 
THEM BRANCHES FOR THE ELEPHANTS ARE 
A VERY IMPORTANT 
PART OF THEIR 
DIET 
HERE AT THE ZOO 
WE ACTUAL 
Y. HAVE A 
LOAD 
DELIVERED ONCE 
A WEEK EVERY 
EVERY EVERY DAY 
WE DO 
AT 
LAP 
THE ZOO AND ONE LAP 
OF WHIPSNADE 
ZOO 
FIVE MILES SO THEY GET QUITE 
GOOD WALK 
WHEN PEOPLE DO TRY TO 
ACCOMPANY 
A WALK THEY REALISE 
ACCOMPANY US ON A WALK THEY REALISE ELEPHANTS HAVE QUITE QUICK PACE 
THEY HAVE A WIDE GAIT AND SO THEY DO 
MOVE QUICK Y. ALTHOUGH RUN IN 
THE TRUE 
SENSE 
OF THE 
WORD 
THEY CAN WALK AT UP TO HOUR FOR 
THOSE WHO 
HAVE NEVER 
IT BEFORE MOST PEOPLE 
ARE SHOCKED 
IT BEFORE MOST PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED THAT 
WALK THE ELEPHANTS ONCE 
THEY HAVE GOT OVER THAT THEY 
AMAZED TO GET THIS CLOSE TO AN 
ELEPHANT 
AND APPRECIATE 
THE FACT 
THAT 
WE ARE 
ABLE TO TAKE THEM TO 
PLACES LIKE THE DOWNS WHERE THEY CAN 
SEE NATURAL BEHAVIOUR 
I NEVER 
NOTICED AN ELEPHANT 
HAVING BAD 
DAYS 
NOTICED AN ELEPHANT HAVING BAD DAYS AND GOOD DAYS 
BUT YOU 
HAVE TO 
ELEPHANTS ARE AND 
BE EXTREME Y. DANGEROUS ANIMALS TAKE 
ALL THE 
PRE AUTIONS 
WE NEED 
TO 
TO ENSURE EVERYONE 
STAYS IS 
SAFE 
WHEN WE DO 
THINGS LIKE 
WALK THEM OR 
WHEN 
WE INTERACT 
WITH 
THEM AS 
WELL 
OUR MAIN REASON FOR ELEPHANTS 
IS THE 
ELEPHANTS AT 
THE ZOO 
IS A 
CONSERVATION ISSUE REALLY THE ASIAN ELEPHANT 
IS AN 
ENDANGERED 
SPECIES 
THERE ARE ONLY 
BETWEEN 
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND ASIAN ELEPHANTS LEFT WILD NOW 
WRAZ THERE'S 
OVER HALF 
WILD NOW WRAZ THERE'S OVER HALF A MILLION AFTER 
CAN ELEMENTS 
OUR AIM 
IS TO 
MAINTAIN A CAPTIVE POPULATION 
AND MANAGE THEM AS THAT REALLY USUALLY WHEN 
WE GET 
BACK 
WALK 
WE LIKE 
TO INSPECT 
THEIR FEET 
TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVEN'T GOT 
ANYTHING 
THEIR PADS 
MAKE 
SURE 
THERE ARE NO 
CRACKED NAILS 
AS 
WELL THAT'S THE END 
OF ANOTHER 
DAY 
FOR ME AND THE ELEPHANTS THEY 
BACK INSIDE EVENING NOW AS I'M SURE 
ARE AWARE 
ELEPHANTS NEVER FORGET SO I'M SURE THEY

ALLOW THEM TO EN OY THE ISLAND ALSO MAKE SURE 
DISTURBING THE BIRDS AND 
THINGS LIKE 
THAT ROUGH HARD LABOUR AS WELL WE THAT WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE ISLAND A CERTAIN 
AMOUNT OF 
LAND MANAGEMENT

KEEPING THE 
ISLAND 
LOOKING GOOD 
WHAT ATTRACT D. YOU TO 
THE JOB THEN 
IT WAS 
THE OPPORTUNITY 
IT WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AMONGST THE SEA BIRDS A LIVE IN O. B. AS WELL SO 
WE ARE 
HERE TWENTY FOUR 
TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS THE ACOMB 
DALINGS LOOKS

KIND OF PERSON 
ARE YOU 
LOOK 
FOR FOR A WARDEN IT 
TAKES A 
SPECIAL 
FOR FOR A WARDEN IT TAKES A SPECIAL TYPE 
OF BERNE 
NOT JUST 
FOR THE 
SKILLS AND 
QUALIFIES 
BUT SOMEONE 
WHO CAN LIVE ON AN ISLAND 
WE DEAL 
WITH FORTY THOUSAND VISITORS A YEAR ARE ARE THEY DIFFICULT TO FIND THEM THEY THEY 
MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT 
DIFFICULT YOU CONTINUED TO FIND 
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO COME 
INTO THIS 
LINE 
OF INDUSTRY 
RE 
ERVE WORK 
AT 
GROUND LEVEL PEOPLE 
ARE NOT 
GET 
THEIR HANDS 
DIRT SLASH 
QUITE LITERALLY 
SO WARDENS HAVE BE 
SPECIALISTS AND 
TOUR 
GUIDES AS 
WELL YOU ARE LOOK 
THE WELL ABILITY TO 
IDENTIFY BIRDS WORK WITH 
BIRDS 
IT IS A 
BIG SKILL INDEED 
ALSO 
SOMEONE WHO 
CAN LIVE 
IN THE TWENTY ONE 
CENTURY WITH THESE SORT 
OF VERY 
BASIC CONDITIONS YOU KNOW THE GAS 
LIGHTS AND 
HAVING TO 
RELY ON THE 
MAINLAND FOR WATER 
NO SHOWERS NO NO SHOWERS IT 
DOES TAKE 
A SPECIAL TYPE 
OF PERSON 
BUT IT IS 
A UNIQUE JOB 
AND 
IT IS GREAT 
EXPERIENCE AND 
A LOT 
OF PEOPLE 
WHO WORK ON 
THE FEARON 
MOVE ON TO OTHER JOBS 
THINK 
IT IS THE 
BEST 
TIME OF THEIR 
LIVES 
THE WARDENS ARE THE ONLY LIVES PEOPLE TO 
EXPERIENCE THE 
ISLANDS BY NIGHT BECAUSE 
THERE'S NO 
ACCOMMODATION FOR ANYONE ELSE BACK ON 
THE MAINLAND 
THERE ARE 
MANY 
PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO TAKE 
THEIR OWN 
ACCOMMODATION WITH THEM AS THEY 
TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRYSIDE IN 
R. VANS AND CARAVANS A 
WHILE AGO MICK 
KALE YA 
WENT

THE WORLD S. BIGGEST CREAM TEA PARTY TELL ME ABOUT THE 
IDEA BEHIND

TRY TO FESTIVAL PROMOTE ALL 
THINGS WEST COUNTRY 
ALL 
THINGS DEVON 
MOST 
CERTAINLY TO 
CELEBRATE ALL THE GOOD FOOD 
AND THE 
LOCAL PRODUCE TO EMPHASISE THE 
FINER ASPECTS OF LIVING SO SO EVERYTHING WE SEE HERE TODAY COMES 
VERY MUCH 
SO 
FROM THE WEST COUNTRY VERY MUCH SO IT IS ALL 
BAKED BY 
LOCAL 
OR 
IT IS CREATED 
BY LOCAL 
ENTREPRENEURS IT 
REALLY IS 
A LOCAL 
CELEBRATION 
OF GOOD 
FOOD 
AND DRINK 
OF COURSE THE BIG DEBATE 
IS WHETHER 
IT IS 
CREAM FIRST 
OR JAM 
FIRST 
AND THEN CREAM I'M BUDGET ON 
I'M BUDGET ON CREAM UNDERNEATH AND JAM ON TOP I 
GREW UP IN DEVON AND I WAS JAM ON 
THE BOTTOM 
AND CREAM ON 
TOP YOU 
AND I 
WILL HAVE TO HAVE A TOP LONG CHAT ABOUT THIS OVER A CREAM 
TEA OR TEN THE CENTREPIECE 
OF THE 
FESTIVAL IS 
THIS CREATION VYING FOR 
ITS PLACE 
BOOKS AS 
THE 
WORLD S. BIGGEST SCONE LOCAL BAKER 
HELEN HAS 
SPENT WEEKS 
COMING UP 
THE PERFECT RECIPE IT 
DOESN'T LOOK 
THE PERFECT RECIPE IT DOESN'T LOOK DIFFICULT

BECAUSE YOU 
HAVE TO GET THE WHOLE SCONE TO COOK

IT IS EDIBLE 
EDIBLE SO 
WE WANT 
D. TO 
MAKE SURE

FOR US 
THE SCONE 
THE MIDDLE AND 
GOT THE 
LIFT ON 
THE MIDDLE AND GOT THE LIFT ON THE SIDES THERE 
IS ONE 
QUESTION I'VE SIDES GOT AND THAT IS 
IS IT JAM

OTHER WAY IT 
IT DEPENDS 
IF YOU 
ARE IN 
CORNWALL APPARENTLY IN DEVON YOU PUT THE JAM ON

CREAM AND

COMPLETE Y. 
DIFFERENT STORY

HUMID AND RAIN AROUND SOME 
OF IT 
QUITE DRAMATIC RAIN A WONDERFUL LINE 
OF THUNDERSTORMS 
BROUGHT IN 
ALONG THIS COLD FRONT AT 
THE MOMENT 
THERE'S A 
HUGE LOW 
WINDING THINGS UP TOWARDS US THE AIR 
IS COMING 
FROM THE 
NORTH 
THE WARMTH 
LINE ON 
FRONT OR 
JUST A 
EAD 
OF IT 
PARTICULARLY THUNDERY IN SHROPSHIRE 
THIS MORNING NOW

UP 
TOWARDS THE BORDERS 
OF SCOTLAND 
L. 
SUSPECT MID AFTERNOON YOU HAVE THE 
POTENTIAL 
SOMEWHERE IN

THUNDERSTORMS NOT QUITE AS DRAMATIC 
AS 
THEY WERE 
THIS MORNING 
THUNDERY ALL THE SAME BEHIND IT A RASH 
OF SHOWERS 
ALMOST CONTINUOUS 
RAIN IN HIGHLAND SCOTLAND

IS LESS 
HUMID THE
