THIS TIME TONY AND JON HIT THE WATER ON A TREE PLANTING ASSIGNMENT 
THE MOST UNUSUAL CONSULTANCY THAT I'M DOING 
JON DRESSES UP TO TACKLE SOME DANGEROUS CUSTOMERS 
DO I LOOK LIKE A SPACEMAN 
AND TONY HAS A SURPRISE LIFT OFF 
WE'RE RIGHT OFF THE GROUND NOW 
TONY KIRKHAM'S IN CHARGE OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND TREES IN THE ROYAL BOTANIC GARDENS KEW 
I WANT TO MAKE TREES MATTER TO PEOPLE TODAY 
TOGETHER WITH HIS BEST TREE CLIMBER JON HAMMERTON TONY IS ON A MISSION 
TO DISCOVER WHETHER IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
WE STILL VALUE THE TREES THAT MADE BRITAIN 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY TREES ARE UNDER ATTACK ON ALL FRONTS 
ONE THING WE'VE NOTICED WHILST MAKING THIS SERIES 
IS THAT TREES ARE UNDER THREAT FROM CLIMATE FROM INFECTION 
AND FROM PEOPLE LIKE NEVER BEFORE 
THE COMBINED FORCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT 
MEAN ESTABLISHED TREES ARE BEING LOST AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE 
THESE HORSE CHESTNUT TREES ARE IN THE WAY OF A LARGE DEVELOPMENT AND 
UNLESS SOMEONE CAN COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE THEY FACE THE CHAINSAW 
IN THIS PROGRAMME WE'RE GOING OFF TO SEE THE EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS THAT PEOPLE GO TO TO SAVE TREES 
WE'RE GONNA COME BACK LATER WITH A RADICAL SOLUTION TO THIS ONE 
TREES PROVIDE SHELTER AND SHADE 
THEY CLEAN THE AIR AND THEY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE AROUND THEM 
IN THE FACE OF WINTER STORMS WARMING SUMMERS AND CREEPING 
URBAN SPRAWL TONY'S KEEN TO SEE IF THERE ARE PEOPLE PREPARED 
TO GO THE EXTRA MILE TO MAKE SURE FUTURE GENERATIONS ENJOY THE TREES THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED 
TONY AND JON ARE HEADING TO THE FAR NORTH OF ENGLAND 
THE LAKE DISTRICT IS NEARLY NINE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES OF NATIONAL PARK 
WHICH SHOULD BE PROTECTION ENOUGH FOR CUMBRIA'S TREES 
BUT TONY HAS COME ACROSS SOME TREE FANATICS WITH A VERY UNUSUAL PROBLEM RIGHT JON 
THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD FUN TODAY 
THE TREES ON WINDERMERE'S FAMOUS ISLANDS ARE UNDER THREAT 
VIOLENT STORMS ARE ERODING THE FOURTEEN ISLANDS CAUSING THEM TO DISINTEGRATE 
THE WINDERMERE CANOE AND KAYAK COMPANY HAVE JUST BECOME VOLUNTARY CUSTODIANS OF THE LAKE'S SECOND 
BIGGEST ISLAND THOMPSON HOLME AND HAVE CALLED TONY AND JON FOR HELP 
THIS IS THE MOST UNUSUAL CONSULTANCY THAT I'M GONNA BE DOING ANYWAY IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING 
TO SAVE THE TREES THEY NEED TO SAVE THE ISLAND 
AND TONY HAS ONE SIMPLE SUGGESTION PLANT MORE TREES SO THE ROOTS WILL HOLD THE ISLAND TOGETHER 
THIS IS ONE OF THE TREES IS IT 
IT IS THAT'S A REALLY NICE SPECIMEN 
IT IS OBVIOUSLY IT'S A NATIVE OAK TREE 
YEAH TONY'S BEING HELPED BY STEVE TATLOCK NATIONAL PARK RANGER FOR WINDERMERE 
THANK YOU DO YOU KNOW HOW TO HOLD THESE PROPERLY 
STICK THE PADDLE ON YOUR HEAD YOU SHOULD MAKE TWO RIGHT ANGLES 
LIKE A TREE 
MATT STIDSON FROM THE CANOE COMPANY 
WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOOKING AFTER THE TREES ON THE ISLAND AND WILL SHOW THEM THE WAY 
WELL I NORMALLY GO IN A VAN TO DO MY WORK 
YOU LOOK LIKE POCAHONTAS IN THAT HAT 
EVERYBODY'S TALKING AT ME 
I DON'T HEAR A WORD THEY'RE SAYIN' 
ONLY THE ECHOES OF MY MIND 
ON THEIR WAY TO THOMPSON HOLME STEVE SHOWS TONY WHAT'S HAPPENING 
TO THE ISLANDS OF WINDERMERE AND THE LAKE'S TREES 
SO TONY WELCOME TO MAIDEN HOLME SO THIS IS AN ISLAND 
WELL ONLY AS RECENTLY AS THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THIS WAS MUCH MUCH BIGGER 
IT WAS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE METRES FROM END TO END AND SEVEN OR EIGHT METRES WIDE 
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES SO ONLY TWENTY YEARS AGO YEAH 
IT'S ONLY THE TREE HOLDING TOGETHER WHAT'S LEFT OF THE ISLAND 
YEAH THIS IS WHAT I'D CALL SEVERE WATER LOGGING PROBLEMS YEAH 
SO REALLY THE ISLAND WE'RE GOING TO NOW TO PLANT A TREE 
IT'S REALLY TRYING TO PREVENT THIS HAPPENING ABSOLUTELY YEAH 
ALL RIGHT JONNY 
LAND AHOY 
BEFORE THEY START PLANTING TONY KEW'S TREE EXPERT HAS GOT TO PROVE HIS WORTH 
STEVE SET US A TASK ACTUALLY A CHALLENGE 
THERE'S AN AMERICAN TREE ON THIS ISLAND 
MOST OF THEM ARE BRITISH NATIVES LIKE BEECH AND OAK AND HE'S SET US A TASK OF FINDING IT 
BUT IT'S DECIDUOUS SO IT COULD BE WELL HIDDEN 
WHILE IT DOESN'T TAKE TONY LONG TO FIND THE TREE 
FOUND IT OVER HERE NAMING IT PROVES A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT 
I THINK THIS IS THE AMERICAN ONE AND IT'S THERE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND 
AND IT'LL POP OUT IN A MINUTE ITS FULL NAME 
YOU'LL HAVE TO USE ENGLISH NAMES 
NOT A SNOWBELL TREE IT'S NOT A SNOWBELL TREE 
A SNOWDROP TREE NO 
SNOW YEAH 
GO ON WHAT SNOW SNOWY 
I'VE FORGOTTEN IT AS WELL 
SNOWY SNOWY 
WHILE TONY IS STRUGGLING SOMEONE ELSE HAS COME UP WITH A SUGGESTION 
I THINK IT'S AMELANCHIER 
IT COULD BE AMELANCHIER YEAH SNOWY MESPILUS 
THAT'S THE ONE WELL DONE JON YOU'RE IMPRESSED BY THAT 
I AM YEAH I'M VERY IMPRESSED 
WITH THAT PROBLEM SOLVED IT'S TIME TO GET PLANTING THE NEW TREE 
TO HELP SAFEGUARD THE ISLAND AGAINST EROSION 
THIS IS THE BUSINESS OH 
HE'S GIVEN ME THE SPADE 
IF YOU'RE THE CUSTODIAN YOU'LL BE ON HERE PLANTING TREES IN THE FUTURE 
IT'S CRITICAL YOU GET IT RIGHT 
SO I THINK IF YOU HAVE THIS SPADE 
O. K. YOU DIG THE HOLE AND I'LL TALK YOU THROUGH IT O. K. 
SO EVERYONE THINKS WE DIG A ROUND HOLE BUT WE ACTUALLY DIG A SQUARE HOLE BECAUSE IT'S EASIER 
FOR TREE ROOTS TO BREAK OUT OF THE CORNER AND ESTABLISH QUICKER 
AND NATURALLY RATHER THAN A CIRCLE 
OR THEY HIT THE CIRCLE AND CARRY ON SPIRALLING LIKE THEY'RE IN A POT O. K. 
OOH THAT'S HARD 
PLENTY OF ROOTS DOWN THERE 
THAT'S THE TURF COMING OFF ISN'T IT 
LOOK AT THAT 
DOING THE BUSINESS THERE MATT D'YOU WANNA GIVE HER A GO 
NOW THE OTHER BASIC PRINCIPLE OF TREE PLANTING 
IS YOU'VE GOT A NURSERY MARK AND THAT'S KNOWN AS A HYPOCOTYL 
IT'S WHERE THE TRUNK JOINS THE ROOTS 
A DIFFERENT COLORATION CAN YOU SEE THE COLOUR 
THAT MUST BE AT SOIL LEVEL WHAT IF IT'S NOT AT THE SOIL LEVEL 
IMAGINE WHEN THIS TREE'S PLANTED AND YOU GET A WIND WHEN THEY SWAY LIKE THIS THEY FLEX AT THIS COLLAR 
AND WHEN THEY FLEX AT THE COLLAR 
THAT TELLS A TREE TO PUT MORE ROOTS ON I UNDERSTAND 
BUT IF YOU PLANT IT TOO DEEP IT CAN'T FLEX AND SO IT NEVER REALLY ESTABLISHES 
IF YOU GET THAT PLANTING DEPTH RIGHT THEN THEY'LL ROAR AWAY 
RIGHT MATT IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS EXCELLENT 
YOU'RE PLANTING FOR THE FUTURE AND I THINK IF YOU CARRY ON 
DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD ISLAND FOR YEARS 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP AND ADVICE YOU'RE WELCOME 
THANKS COME BACK ANY TIME 
LET'S GET BACK BEFORE THAT RAIN COMES SOUNDS GOOD TO ME LET'S GO 
HAVING HELPED SAVE THOMPSON HOLME ISLAND AND ITS TREES FOR THE FUTURE TONY AND JON ARE HEADING SOUTH 
THOUGH SAVING A TREE IS NEVER EASY FOR MOST PEOPLE THE BATTLE DOESN'T INVOLVE CANOES AND ISLANDS 
A TREE PRESERVATION ORDER GIVES A TREE THE FULL PROTECTION OF THE LAW 
GETTING AN ORDER IS SOMETHING ANYONE CAN DO WITH A LITTLE KNOW HOW AND PERSERVERANCE 
IN HARVINGTON PARK IN BECKENHAM KENT STANDS AN ATLANTIC CEDAR 
LOCAL RESIDENT WENDY GOWLETT HAS KNOWN THE TREE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
I REALLY COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE THE AREA WITHOUT IT 
IT SO IMPACTS ON THE ENTRANCE TO THE HARVINGTON ESTATE 
I DON'T KNOW A HUGE AMOUNT ABOUT TREES BUT WE LOVE THIS TREE 
THIS GIANT CEDAR IS VERY CLOSE TO THE LODGE WHICH WAS RECENTLY PUT UP FOR SALE 
WENDY'S FEAR WAS SOMEONE CHOOSING TO BUY THE BUILDING 
IN THE FUTURE MIGHT BE LESS KEEN ON THE CENTURY OLD TREE 
WITH NOTHING PREVENTING IT FROM BEING CUT DOWN WENDY DECIDED TO ACT 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WENDY TO SAVE THIS TREE 
WELL I KNEW A LITTLE ABOUT TREE PRESERVATION ORDERS SO WE APPROACHED THE COUNCIL IN THE VIEW 
TO HOPEFULLY HAVING A TREE PRESERVATION PUT ON THE TREE 
ANYONE CUTTING OR PRUNING A PROTECTED TREE WITHOUT PERMISSION 
CAN BE FINED UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND 
IT'S GREAT PEOPLE GET SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THEM AND FIGHT TO KEEP 'EM 
FOR A TREE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A PRESERVATION ORDER IT MUST BE HIGHLY VISIBLE TO THE PUBLIC 
BUT IF IT'S DEAD DYING OR DANGEROUS IT WON'T QUALIFY SO JON'S GOT SOME TREETOP DETECTIVE WORK TO DO 
SO I'LL JUST DO A BIT OF FILMING 
JUST CHECKING THIS SIDE OUT 
NAH IT'S ALL PRETTY SAFE 
SO HOW'S IT LOOKING JON IT WAS JUST LIKE ANY OLD CEDAR IN THE GARDENS 
FALLING DOWN NO 
CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH 
GOOD NEWS WITH THE CEDAR GIVEN THE ALL CLEAR THE PLANNING OFFICER 
CAN GIVE WENDY THE NEWS SHE'S BEEN WAITING FOR 
SO THERE YOU GO WENDY TREE ONE THE ATLANTIC CEDAR IS SAFE ARE YOU PLEASED 
VERY PLEASED YES IT'S MADE ME VERY HAPPY 
YOU CAN SLEEP NOW I SHALL CONTINUE TO COME HERE AND ENJOY IT 
WAHEY OH AND IT HIT IT 
HERE'S TO WENDY AND CORAL 
AND HERE'S TO OUR TREE YEAH 
CHEERS CHEERS CHEERS 
CHEERS CORAL THANK YOU 
YOU DON'T GET ONE OF THESE WITH EVERY TREE PRESERVATION ORDER 
BY THE WAY JUST IN CASE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING 
BUT NOT EVERY TREE HAS SOMEONE LIKE WENDY TO BE ITS CHAMPION 
EPPING FOREST DISTRICT BORDERS LONDON AND THE PRESSURE ON TREES FROM URBAN SPRAWL IS INCREASING 
JON STOKES FROM THE TREE COUNCIL HAS INVITED TONY AND JON 
TO SEE A SOLITARY BLACK POPLAR NEAR WALTHAM ABBEY 
THIS TREE WAS SURROUNDED BY MANY OTHERS BUT IS A LONE SURVIVOR 
STANDING ON THE EDGE OF A HOUSING ESTATE 
THIS IS A YOU KNOW FANTASTIC TREE 
GROWING IN THE MIDDLE OF A HOUSING ESTATE NEXT TO THE MOTORWAY 
SO HOW DO YOU PROTECT IT YOU'VE GOT TO GET PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT THIS IS 
PART OF THEIR HERITAGE THIS IS SOMETHING THEY SHOULD VALUE 
CHRIS NEILAN TREE OFFICER FOR EPPING FOREST DISTRICT HAS COME UP WITH A NOVEL WAY 
OF GETTING PEOPLE TO STAND UP FOR TREES LIKE THIS SOLITARY POPLAR AND TONY AND JON ARE PART OF HIS PLANS 
WE GET THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT TO NOMINATE THEIR FAVOURITE TREES AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING THAT 
WHAT WE NEED HELP WITH IS TO GET THE BEST ONES 
THE ONES THAT YOU CHOOSE 
WILL BE DECLARED THE FIFTY FAVOURITE TREES OF EPPING FOREST DISTRICT 
AND WE HOPE THAT THAT WILL HELP US SAVE THEM 
LIKE THIS TREE OBVIOUSLY NEEDS A BIT OF WORK SO IT DOESN'T BREAK UP IN THE NEXT WIND 
WELL NOW WE KNOW ABOUT IT WE CAN HELP DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT THERE ARE OTHERS 
OUT THERE AS WELL AND I SUPPOSE WE CAN'T DO EVERYTHING 
WE NEED TO KNOW WHICH ONES WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON 
SO IT'S A KIND OF POP IDOL FOR TREES YEAH 
HERE'S THE BOOK WITH THEM ALL IN 
WE'LL GO AWAY DIGEST THESE AND COME AND GIVE YOU A HAND BRILLIANT 
HAVING STUDIED OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ENTRIES SENT IN RESPONSE TO CHRIS' PUBLIC APPEAL 
TONY AND JON HAVE COME TO THE LOCAL MUSEUM IN WALTHAM ABBEY TO JOIN THE JUDGING PANEL 
THEY HAVE TO WHITTLE DOWN THE ENTRIES TO THE WINNING FIFTY 
JON AND I LIKE THE HORSE CHESTNUT 
WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD SHIFT THAT TO THE MAYBES 
A DEFINITE YES 
IT'S NOT AS EASY AS THIS ON POP IDOL IS IT 
I'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH THIS ONE GUYS 
THERE'S A BIT OF COMPETITION THERE WE MIGHT BE VOTING 
ALL THOSE FOR THE OAK 
YOU'RE HAPPY AREN'T YOU I AM 
ONE THAT HAD TWO NOMINATIONS WAS THE BLACK POPLAR ON THE OLD ROYAL ORDNANCE SITE 
THE BLACK POPLAR THAT TONY AND JON SAW IS UP FOR NOMINATION 
IF WE GAVE IT SOME CREDIT AND PUT IT INTO THE TOP FIFTY WILL IT GIVE IT A BIT OF CLOUT 
IT DOES YEAH 
I THINK IT SHOULD GO ON THEN 
WHILE THE JUDGES SEEM TO AGREE ON MOST NOMINATIONS 
THERE'S ONE TREE PROVING A BIT OF A STICKING POINT 
WELL I ALSO LOOKED VERY HARD AT THIS TREE IN THE SCHOOL 
AND I FELT THAT YOU KNOW THREE HUNDRED FIFTY KIDS CAN'T BE WRONG REALLY 
LOOKED AT OBJECTIVELY IT'S AN ORDINARY OAK ISN'T IT 
AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS ABOUT PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT THIS IS ABOUT THE FUTURE 
IS THIS A DEFINITE YES OR A DEFINITE NO OR A MAYBE 
WE'RE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ALL UNSURE HERE 
I THINK JON AND I HAVE TO GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT THIS AND SEE IT 
I THINK THE PHOTOGRAPHS AREN'T REALLY GIVING US A FEEL 
WE'VE GOT TO GO AND SEE IT MAYBE MEET 
THE TREE IN QUESTION IS IN THE THOMAS WILLINGALE SCHOOL IN LOUGHTON 
TONY AND JON HAVE COME TO MEET THE HEAD MRS. SMITH 
HELLO HELLO MRS. SMITH 
WE HEARD THERE WAS A LOT MORE TO THIS TREE THAN WHAT WE WERE READING 
WELL HAVE A LOOK AT THIS 
BRILLIANT ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
THE BEST MOMENT FOR ALL OF US 
THIS TREE IT WAS UNDER THREAT 
THE TREE IS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE METRES AWAY FROM A HOUSE AND THERE WAS SOME SUGGESTION 
THAT IT WAS CAUSING SUBSIDENCE 
AND THAT MEANT THAT WE WERE SENT A LETTER ASKING TO CUT IT DOWN 
THE CHILDREN WERE REALLY QUITE DETERMINED NOBODY WOULD CUT IT DOWN 
THIS IS A SCHOOL THAT'S PASSIONATE ABOUT TREES 
IT'S NAMED AFTER THOMAS WILLINGALE FAMOUS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
FOR SAVING EPPING FOREST FROM DEVELOPMENT BY BIG LANDOWNERS 
CONTINUING IN HIS FOOTSTEPS MRS. SMITH IS DETERMINED TO HELP SAVE HER OAK 
BY GETTING IT INTO THE TOP FIFTY 
I MEAN DO THE RESIDENTS FEAR YOU THE NEIGHBOURS 
WE'VE HEARD YOU'VE GOT A FIERY REPUTATION WHEN IT COMES TO TREES 
I'M VERY ENTHUSIASTIC AND I DO FOLLOW WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT 
AND UM I'M VERY DETERMINED AS WELL 
DOES MRS. SMITH TEACH YOU ALL ABOUT TREES IN THE CLASSES YEAH 
AND DO YOU COME OUT AND HAVE YOUR LESSONS UNDER HERE AS WELL 
OUR FIRST EVER SCIENCE LESSON WE CAME TO THIS TREE 
SO YOU'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER SCIENCE FROM THIS TREE 
YEAH GREAT 
I WISH I HAD MY LESSONS UNDER TREES 
AS THE REST OF YEAR SIX COME TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR PRECIOUS TREE 
JON DECIDES TO HEAD INTO THE BRANCHES 
YEAH TONY THINKS HE'S THE HEADMASTER NOW HE'S TAKEN CONTROL 
AND WE'VE COME TO HAVE A LOOK AT THIS TREE AND SEE 
IF IT'S WORTHY OF GOING IN THE TOP SPOT QUALIFYING FOR THE TOP FIFTY 
SO DO YOU ALL WANT IT TO QUALIFY 
YES 
BUT JON ISN'T THE ONLY WILDLIFE IN THIS OLD OAK IT'S A SQUIRREL 
A SQUIRREL 
A SQUIRREL DROPPED 
IT'S A GOOD HEALTHY TREE FROM HERE GOOD 
THERE'S NO DECAY 
A FEW BITS OF DEAD WOOD BUT 
NOTHING MAJOR THOUGH NOTHING 
APART FROM SOMETHING JUST JUMPED OUT THAT WAS A BIT OF A PAIN 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON IT'S IN PRETTY GOOD NICK AS A JUDGE 
WELL I'M IN YOU'RE IN YEAH O. K. LET'S SEE WHAT THEY SAY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU WE'RE IN 
BEFORE TONY AND JON HAVE A CHANCE TO DELIVER THEIR VERDICT TO THE SCHOOL THEY'RE RECALLED TO KEW 
TONY'S RESPONSIBLE FOR FOURTEEN THOUSAND TREES IN THE ROYAL BOTANIC GARDENS 
AND THERE'S A PROBLEM THAT MEANS SOME OF HIS OWN TREES NEED SAVING 
KEW HAS GOT AN INVASION OF CONTINENTAL OAK PROCESSIONARY MOTHS 
THE CATERPILLARS ATTACK OUR NATIVE OAKS AND NEED TO BE REMOVED NOW 
BEFORE THEY BECOME MOTHS AND FLY AWAY TO REPRODUCE THREATENING YET MORE TREES 
IT'S NOT JUST THE TREES THAT NEED PROTECTING 
SO A BIT DIFFERENT TO WHAT WE NORMALLY WEAR 
COMPLETE COVERAGE 
MASKS RESPIRATORS TOTALLY DIFFERENT TO WHAT WE NORMALLY DO 
NOT CHAINSAWS BLOW TORCH 
THE CATERPILLAR OF THIS PARASITE HAS SIXTY TWO THOUSAND FINE HAIRS 
EACH ONE CARRYING BACTERIA 
WHICH CAN CAUSE SEVERE RASHES AND BREATHING PROBLEMS 
IF THIS INSECT GETS HOLD IN ENGLAND IT'LL CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES 
FOR SURE IT'S THAT SERIOUS VERY SERIOUS 
IF YOU HAVE SAY FIFTY OR ONE HUNDRED NESTS IN THIS TREE 
THEN OVERNIGHT THEY COULD DEFOLIATE THE WHOLE TREE 
THAT'LL PUT THE TREE UNDER STRESS WE'RE CATCHING IT 
IN ITS EARLY STAGES NOW BEING PROACTIVE AND STOPPING IT GETTING TO THOSE PROPORTIONS 
WITH EACH NEST CONTAINING UP TO TWO HUNDRED CATERPILLARS TO ERADICATE THE THREAT TO THE TREE 
AND TO PEOPLE BELOW YOU NEED TO GET RID OF THE NESTS WHICH MEANS SOMEONE NEEDS TO GET INTO THE TREE 
SO DO I LOOK LIKE A SPACEMAN 
TONY HAS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF HOW BAD THESE CATERPILLARS CAN BE 
WHAT THEY DO WHEN YOU AGGRAVATE THE CATERPILLARS 
THEY CAN SHOOT THOSE HAIRS OUT SIXTY TWO THOUSAND OF THEM AND YOU COME UP WITH A RASH 
IT LOOKED LIKE I HAD CHICKEN POX SO I GOT CAUGHT OUT WITHOUT CLOTHING ON 
WHEN WE DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND MUCH ABOUT THEM SO I DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT AGAIN 
JON HAS TO REMOVE EACH NEST BY HAND 
AND ELIMINATE ANY STRAY HAIRS THAT ARE LEFT BEHIND WITH A BLOWTORCH 
YOU START ITCHING JUST JUST THINKING ABOUT IT 
PLENTY OF HAIRS IN THERE YEAH 
ANOTHER ONE FOR THE INCINERATOR 
WELL DONE JON 
TREE PESTS AND DISEASES ARE A PROBLEM THEY ARE WITH US 
AND WE WILL GET MORE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 
AND IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A TREE 
THEN CALL IN AN APPROVED ARBORIST OR YOUR LOCAL AUTHORITY ARBORICULTURAL OFFICER 
IT'S PRETTY HOT IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WHERE HE COMES FROM ORIGINALLY BUT IT'S VERY HOT WHERE HE'S GOING NOW 
JOB DONE 
THE RECENT INVASION OF PARASITES FROM THE CONTINENT HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY CHANGING CLIMATE 
WARMER SUMMERS HAVE ALSO CAUSED DROUGHTS RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF MANY NATIVE TREES 
TO ENSURE FUTURE GENERATIONS HAVE TREES AT ALL TONY'S BEEN PIONEERING 
A RADICAL APPROACH FOR ANYONE PLANNING TO GET PLANTING 
THIS IS HIS OWN APPROACH TO SAVING TREES IN THE LONG TERM 
IF BRITISH SUMMERS ARE TO BECOME MORE LIKE MEDITERRANEAN 
THEN TONY BELIEVES WE SHOULD START PLANTING TREES MORE SUITED TO THAT CLIMATE 
IT'S A BIG DAY TODAY THE MAYOR OF LONDON KEN LIVINGSTONE IS COMING TO OFFICIALLY OPEN THIS GARDEN 
THE LANDSCAPE WE'VE CREATED HERE IS POTENTIALLY A GARDEN OF THE FUTURE 
THIS IF CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES THEN THIS IS A TYPE OF GARDEN 
THAT WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE CERTAINLY IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND 
WE'VE GOT LOTS OF TREES HERE 
WE'VE GOT PINES AND OAKS AND OLIVES 
YOU MAY REMEMBER IN THE LAST SERIES WE WENT TO ITALY WE CHOSE THESE OLIVES 
AND THEN WE CRANED THEM IN AND THE MORRIS DANCERS WASSAILED THEM WITH OLIVE OIL 
SO WE BROKE A BIT OF TRADITION THERE 
BUT THERE THEY ARE FLOWERING AWAY READY TO PRODUCE OLIVES 
THESE ARE TREES THAT WEREN'T COMMONLY PLANTED FIVE YEARS AGO BUT NOW THESE ARE TREES 
THAT WE'LL SEE MORE OF IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND 
IF THE CLIMATE CHANGES AS IT'S DOING TODAY 
THE TEAM HAVE BEEN THROUGH HERE TODAY AND GOT IT LOOKING GOOD 
AND IT IS LOOKING GOOD BUT YOU ALWAYS FIND THE ODD WEED 
IT'S FINE NOW 
HE'S COMING NOW SO BETTER BE ON OUR STATIONS 
A MEDITERRANEAN GARDEN WE HAVE A SMALL CEREMONY FOR YOU 
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT 
ONE TWO THREE OPEN 
CAMERAS CLICK 
THERE WE GO 
MAY I INTRODUCE TONY KIRKHAM 
HI NICE TO MEET YOU 
THE THEME THIS YEAR IS THE MEDITERRANEAN 
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT SHOWING PLANTS PEOPLE CAN PLANT IN GARDENS 
NOT WATER THAT WILL SURVIVE OUR CLIMATE NOW IN THE SOUTH 
DO YOU LIKE WORKING WITH TREES 
I LOVE ANYTHING IN THE GARDEN IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS ME SANE 
I GOT IT FROM MY MUM SHE'D BE OUT IN THE GARDEN AT MIDNIGHT WITH A TORCH 
WELL YOU KNOW WE WILL CHANGE THE TREE SCAPE BY PLANTING TREES 
AND SELECTION IS IMPORTANT 
WELL THAT WAS IT THAT ALL SEEMED TO GO WELL HE'S VERY INTERESTED 
BUT JOB DONE HERE 
I'VE GOT TO GET ON NOW BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO GET ON WITH THIS MISSION AND GO AND LOOK AT SOME TREES 
I'VE GOT TO GET ME KEW KIT BACK ON AND AWAY SO 
TONY AND JON ARE HEADING TO THE EAST OF ENGLAND SHOWGROUND IN PETERBOROUGH 
THIS LARGE EXHIBITION CENTRE IS NEARING COMPLETION 
AND FIVE HORSE CHESTNUTS ARE IN THE WAY OF AN OUTSIDE DISPLAY AREA 
EVERYONE'S BEEN THINKING HARD ABOUT HOW TO SAVE THEM AND TONY'S RETURNED 
TO SEE IF THEY'VE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION 
WE THINK WE'VE GOT ONE 
AND HERE IT IS NOW IT'S COMING 
NOW THAT IS BIG KIT JON BIG KIT 
JON THOUGHT WE WERE BRINGING A SPADE AND A WHEELBARROW 
PERHAPS THE MOST DRAMATIC WAY TO SAVE A TREE IS SIMPLY TO PICK IT UP AND MOVE IT 
THIS TREE WEIGHS AROUND FIVE TONNES AND NEEDS TO BE MOVED FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY METRES TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SHOWGROUND 
THEY'VE HAD TO CALL IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST OF THESE MACHINES IN BRITAIN TO DO THE JOB 
WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS IS A MACHINE THAT GOES ROUND THE TREE 
THIS'LL CLOSE UP AND THERE'S SEVERAL STAKES THAT PUSH INTO THE GROUND 
AND GO UNDER AND JOIN UNDERNEATH UNDER THE ROOT BALL AND IT CAN ALL BE LIFTED OUT 
DON'T THINK I'M EVEN GONNA GET ME HANDS DIRTY TODAY 
THIS ISN'T A SOLUTION FOR THE FAINT HEARTED 
WITH THE COST OF MOVING A SINGLE TREE TOPPING ONE THOUSAND 
THERE'S SOME POWER THERE AS THOSE BLADES START TO CUT IN 
JEFF WHAT'S THE IDEA OF THE WATER 
IT JUST HITS THE BACK OF THE SPADE AND MAKES IT EASIER IT JUST LUBRICATES THE SOIL 
AND MAKES IT A LOT EASIER FOR US TO DIG 
SO ARE YOU JUST START WITH THIS ONE STRAIGHTAWAY FROM YA 
WHILST SOME OF THE ROOTS ARE INEVITABLY CUT OFF 
ENOUGH OF THE ROOT BALL IS RETAINED TO GIVE THE TREE A GOOD CHANCE OF SURVIVING THE MOVE 
YEAH I'VE GOT THE POWER NOW IT'S IN MY HANDS 
IT'S ALL ABOUT WATERING YOU KNOW 
IT'S ALL RIGHT HIM PULLING LEVERS 
READY TO LIFT JIM 
TONY D'YOU WANNA JUMP IN YEP 
WE'RE RIGHT OFF THE GROUND NOW 
THE WHOLE LORRY'S UP IS IT JUST ON THE BACK WHEELS 
DON'T LOOK BACK INTO THE SUN BY THE LIBERTINES 
WHAT A PIECE OF KIT THAT IS 
LET'S SEE IF IT'LL GO IN THE HOLE NOW 
SO THERE'S A WATERING LOOP IN HERE 
SO THIS IS A TUBE THAT'S PERFORATED AND THE IDEA IS 
THAT YOU CAN GET WATER IN THERE BY POURING IT DOWN THE TUBE 
LOOK AT THAT STRAIGHT IN 
I TELL YOU WHAT 
WHEN THESE PEOPLE LOOK OUT THEIR WINDOW IN THE MORNING THEY'LL GET A SURPRISE 
HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE IT'S DEAD UPRIGHT 
LOOK AT THE TREE THROUGH HERE KEEP YOUR EYE LOOKING AT THE TOP MAKING SURE IT STAYS NICE AND LEVEL 
PRETTY GOOD THAT 
AND THERE IT IS JOB DONE TREE MOVED NEW HOME 
THERE'S NO REASON WHY THAT WON'T SURVIVE ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED YEARS YEP 
TREES TODAY ARE UNDER THREAT LIKE NEVER BEFORE 
BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THIS PROGRAMME ARE THE EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS THAT PEOPLE GO TO TO SAVE TREES 
WELL THAT'S ANOTHER TREE SAVED FOR THE FUTURE JON JOB DONE 
WELL DONE T. 
TONY AND JON HAVE ONE MORE IMPORTANT JOB TO DO BEFORE HEADING BACK TO KEW 
THEY'VE RETURNED TO THOMAS WILLINGALE SCHOOL IN LOUGHTON 
TO GIVE SOME NEWS TO AN EXPECTANT AUDIENCE 
RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY 
GOOD AFTERNOON 
AH THAT GOT YOU DIDN'T IT

HERE GOES AND GOOD LUCK 
O. K. 
THE FIFTY FAVOURITE TREES COMMITTEE HAVE CONSIDERED YOUR APPLICATION 
AND 
YOU HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL 
WELL DONE EVERYBODY CONGRATULATIONS 
IT'S A SPECIAL TREE AND WILL STAY A SPECIAL TREE FOR A LONG TIME SO WELL DONE WELL DONE EVERYONE 
CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU YOU SHOULD BE PROUD 
I'M ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED WE ARE AS WELL 
PLANT A LITTLE SEED 
PLANT A LITTLE SEED 
PLANT IT IN THE GROUND 
PLANT IT IN THE GROUND 
WAIT FOR IT TO GROW 
WAIT FOR IT TO GROW 
DON'T 
DON'T DIS 
DON'T DIS TURB

NEXT TIME TONY AND JON TAKE TO THE AIR 
TO LOOK AT THE PLIGHT OF TREES IN CITIES 
JON GOES UP IN THE WORLD 
AND TONY GETS A HELPING HAND 
IT'S GREAT ISN'T IT 
NOTHING MORE REWARDING THAN SEEING CHILDREN PLANTING TREES 
SUNSHINE WILL COME 
THE RAINDROPS WILL FALL 
AND THAT'S THAT
