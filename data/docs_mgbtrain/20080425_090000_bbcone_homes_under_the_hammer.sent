BUT WE'RE BECOMING MORE CAUTIOUS 
MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO BUY YOUR HOME UNDER THE HAMMER 
WELL IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR VARIETY BUT ALSO GOOD VALUE TOO THEN THE AUCTION HOUSE MAY BE FOR YOU 
WELL HERE ARE THE PROPERTIES THAT TEMPTED OUR BUYERS ON TODAY'S SHOW 
IT'S NOT ALWAYS HOMES THAT GO UNDER THE HAMMER TAKE THIS INDUSTRIAL BUILDING IN SOMERSET FOR EXAMPLE 
THESE KIND OF PROPERTIES FETCH BIG MONEY 
FOR THE BUYER WHO LIKES TO KEEP THEIR FEET ON THE GROUND THERE'S THIS BUNGALOW IN WOKINGHAM 
THERE'S THIS SERVING HATCH IF THAT'S YOUR KIND OF THING 
AND IN STOKE ON TRENT AN OLD RAILWAY COTTAGE IS JUST THE TICKET 
WOW WHAT A FIREPLACE 
THESE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN SOLD AT AUCTION WE'LL FIND OUT 
WHO BOUGHT THEM AND WHAT THEY PAID FOR THEM WHEN THEY WENT UNDER THE HAMMER 
I'M IN THE VILLAGE OF HENSRIDGE ON THE BORDER OF DORSET AND SOMERSET 
BUT I'M NOT HERE TO SEE ONE OF THESE PRETTY LITTLE COTTAGES 
I'M HERE TO SEE SOMETHING VERY VERY DIFFERENT 
OF COURSE IT'S NOT JUST HOUSES THAT COME UP AT AUCTION 
I'M LOOKING AT SOMETHING WHICH IS NOTHING MORE THAN A GLORIFIED SHED 
IT'S ACTUALLY THIS PURPOSE BUILT INDUSTRIAL UNIT ON 
AN INDUSTRIAL ESTATE BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT THESE KIND OF PROPERTIES FETCH BIG MONEY 
THIS DETACHED UNIT WENT TO AUCTION AT A GUIDE PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
IT'S A CLASSIC WITH A STEEL FRAME CONSTRUCTION 
CLAD WITH STONE AND STEEL SHEETING SO THE OUTSIDE IS PRACTICAL AND EASY TO MAINTAIN 
LET'S CHECK OUT THE INSIDE 
SO WHAT DO YOU GET IN A BUILDING LIKE THIS 
WELL THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR OR MORE ACCURATELY THE SIDE DOOR INTO 
WHAT I SUPPOSE IS A RECEPTION AREA AND A SPACE HERE AND BASICALLY IT'S JUST REALLY PRACTICAL 
YOU'VE GOT A KITCHEN YOU'VE GOT A LOO WITH A HAND BASIN THERE 
AGAIN THROUGH THIS RECEPTION AREA INTO ANOTHER ROOM 
BEFORE YOU SEE THAT WHAT DO YOU RECKON IT IS A STORE ROOM WORKSHOP OR AN OFFICE 
WELL IF YOU ANSWERED C. YOU ARE CORRECT 
IT IS AN OFFICE AND ACTUALLY IT'S NOT A BAD SIZE SPACE 
AGAIN JUST VERY PRACTICAL BUT THIS ISN'T THE MAIN PART OF THE UNIT 
IT'S OVER THERE 
IT'S A PRETTY CAVERNOUS SPACE ALL RIGHT 
THE INTERNAL MEASUREMENTS ARE ALMOST TWELVE METRES BY THIRTEEN METRES 
NOW I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHATSOEVER FOR REQUIRING A BUILDING 
LIKE THIS AND YET I WISH I COULD FIND A REASON BECAUSE IT IS PERFECT FOR SOMEBODY 
LOOK AT THIS THE HIGH CEILINGS VERY LOW MAINTENANCE 
IT'S GOT A VERY MODERN ROOF THESE HIGH SHUTTERED DOORS HERE 
FOR SOMEBODY WHO WAS RUNNING A BUSINESS THAT NEEDED THIS KIND OF SPACE IT IS IDEAL 
THAT'S GOBBLEDEGOOK BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IT IS A PERFECT INDUSTRIAL PREMISES 
LOW MAINTENANCE BIG SPACE EASY TO LOOK AFTER 
PERFECT 
THERE LOOKS TO BE POTENTIAL HERE FOR ANY SHREWD INVESTOR 
IF THE NEW OWNER IS LOOKING TO RENT I RECKON THEY COULD DIVIDE THE UNIT IN HALF AND GET TWICE THE INCOME 
YOU SEEM TO HAVE A LOT HERE THERE'S A RECEPTION MEETING ROOM STAFF LOO KITCHEN AND AN OFFICE 
AND AS A FINAL BONUS AT THE BACK OF THE UNIT YOU'VE GOT THIS LARGE AREA OF HARD STANDING 
IT'S GREAT YEP I'M SOLD ON THIS UNIT 
IT IS A SPECIALIST NICHE MARKET SO I'VE ARRANGED FOR 
A LOCAL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY EXPERT TO COME AND TAKE A LOOK 
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A CHAIN REACTION 
CAN HE SHED ANY LIGHT ON THE HISTORY OF THE PLACE 
IT'S BEEN USED FOR CAR REPAIRS AND IT'S BEEN USED FOR A TAXI HIRE FIRM 
IT'S ON A BIG SITE AND THERE'S ROOM FOR MORE DEVELOPMENT IN THE BACK HERE 
THERE'S PLENTY OF POTENTIAL 
IF THIS WAS A HOUSE IT WOULD NEED VERY LITTLE WORK 
JUST A SPLASH OF PAINT AND YOU CAN MOVE STRAIGHT IN 
GREAT NEWS FOR PROSPECTIVE BUSINESSES 
IT'S A MODERN BUILDING DOESN'T NEED MONEY SPENT ON IT ANYBODY COULD MOVE IN HERE STRAIGHTAWAY 
IT'S ALL UP TOGETHER 
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR DREAM FAMILY HOME WITH 
VIEWS OF THE OCEAN THIS WON'T FIT THE BILL HOWEVER IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 
AN INDUSTRIAL PREMISES THAT COULD WORK FOR YOUR BUSINESS DOES THIS CUT THE MUSTARD

ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WELL DONE SIR WELL THE FINAL BID OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
WAS MADE BY JEREMY AND HIS FATHER PETER SO THEY NOW OWN THE PERFECT PREMISES FOR THEIR SMALL BUSINESS 
IN FACT JEREMY'S GONE ON HOLIDAY TO CELEBRATE SO I MET UP WITH HIS DAD AT THE PROPERTY 
PETER NICE TO MEET YOU AND YOU CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU WHY DID YOU WANT TO BUY THIS PLACE 
I DIDN'T WANT TO BUY IT IT WAS MY SON WHO WANTED TO BUY IT RIGHT HE USED A BIT OF MY MONEY TO DO IT 
BUT IT WILL BE GOOD FOR HIM IN THE FUTURE HERE SO TELL ME MORE 
WHY DID HE WANT TO BUY IT 
WELL WE MANUFACTURE TIMBER BUILDINGS AND THE SITE WE'RE ON IS NOT REALLY SUITABLE FOR WHAT WE DO 
AND WE STRUGGLE A BIT WITH THE SPACE BUT THIS BUILDING WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY IDEAL 
SO WHAT KIND OF THINGS DO YOU MAKE WELL WE MAKE ALL SORTS OF BUILDINGS OUT OF TIMBER 
STABLES SUMMERHOUSES GARAGES 
ANYTHING THAT NEEDS WOOD WE MAKE IT 
SO WHERE ARE YOU BASED AT THE MOMENT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YARDS UP THE ROAD 
NO YES 
AND WE'RE GONNA STILL KEEP PART OF THAT ON BECAUSE 
THERE ARE OTHER SIDES TO OUR BUSINESS WHICH WE'LL NEED THE SPACE UP THERE TO RUN IT FROM 
SO AT WHAT POINT DID YOU NOTICE THIS PLACE WAS UP FOR SALE 
ABOUT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND WE HAD A LOOK AT IT THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IDEAL AND SO WE DECIDED TO GO FOR IT 
YOU MUST BE COCK A HOOP BECAUSE IT'S LITERALLY SO CLOSE 
AND WE'VE ALSO GOT THE SAME POSTCODE WHICH IS VERY GOOD 
FOR THINGS LIKE YOUR LITERATURE AND STATIONERY 
PETER USED TO BE A SCHOOLTEACHER BUT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE HE STARTED A BUSINESS 
CUTTING TIMBER FOR THE BUILDING TRADE AND MANUFACTURING WOODEN STRUCTURES 
IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE HIS SON JEREMY TOOK OVER THE COMPANY AND PETER SEMI RETIRED 
THEY'D BEEN ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ADDITIONAL PREMISES FOR SOME TIME 
YOU WENT TO THE AUCTION THEN DID YOU HAVE A PRICE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU MIGHT PAY 
WE THOUGHT THAT A GOOD PRICE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
BUT WE ALSO REALISED THAT IF WE HAD TO DEVELOP 
OUR OWN SITE AND PUT A BUILDING LIKE THIS UP WE WERE GONNA LOSE A LOT OF MONEY IN LOST PRODUCTION 
AND SO WE THOUGHT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND SO WE WERE QUITE HAPPY TO BUY AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY WHICH WE DID 
WE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD PRICE AND FAIR TO US YOU KNOW SO WE'RE PLEASED 
WELL I'M NOT SURPRISED PETER AND JEREMY FOUND JUST THE KIND OF INDUSTRIAL UNIT THEY WERE AFTER 
THERE'S JUST AN EMPTY SPACE 
WHAT WILL YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET THIS PLACE SUITABLE FOR YOUR BUSINESS 
VERY LITTLE 
OBVIOUSLY CLEAN IT UP A LITTLE BIT 
THE ELECTRICS ARE HERE WE'LL NEED THE ELECTRICIAN IN AND 
WE COULD BE UP AND RUNNING HERE WITHIN THREE FOUR DAYS MAXIMUM WOW 
AND OF COURSE MOVING OUR EQUIPMENT DOWN HERE 
ONLY ONE HUNDRED YARDS IS NOT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM 
IN TERMS OF THE STORE ROOM AND THE OFFICE AND THE LOO IS THAT STAYING AS IT IS 
YES IT'LL STAY AS IT IS 
THE OFFICE IS NOT QUITE BIG ENOUGH BUT WE CAN COPE WITH A FEW ALTERATIONS AND WHAT HAVE YOU 
SO IN TIME THAT WILL BE DONE 
ANY IDEA HOW MUCH THE LITTLE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IS GONNA COST YOU VERY LITTLE 
PROBABLY LESS THAN FIVE THOUSAND 
AND THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO SPEND MUCH MONEY ON A REMOVAL FIRM 
THEY'RE ONLY GOING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YARDS THEY COULD PROBABLY DO IT THEMSELVES 
WHAT ABOUT THE BIG AREA AT THE BACK IS THAT OF ANY USE 
WELL IT'S A LIMITED AREA IN ONE RESPECT 
IT'S A MUCH SMALLER SPACE THAN WHAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT BUT 
WE'LL BE ABLE TO ORGANISE IT 
IN HERE WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE 
THERE WILL BE WOODWORKING MACHINES IN HERE OCCASIONALLY WHEN WE PRODUCE SOMETHING WE HAVE TO ASSEMBLE IT 
AS WE'RE DOING IT SO WE'LL HAVE ROOM TO DO THAT AS WELL SO IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE USEFUL 
RIGHT AND IT'S NICE AND LIGHT LOTS OF NATURAL LIGHT YES IT IS SO WHAT ABOUT HEATING 
ARE YOU PLANNING TO PUT HEATING IN THEY'LL BE HEATING IN THE OFFICE 
YOU DON'T NORMALLY PUT HEATING IN AN AREA LIKE THIS OTHERWISE THE MEN STOP WORK 
THEY KIND OF WORK THEMSELVES WARM 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE WORKING HERE 
GENERALLY JUST TWO PEOPLE BUT OCCASIONALLY THREE OCCASIONALLY FOUR 
BUT IT'S NORMALLY TWO PEOPLE 
SO WHAT NEXT 
WELL MOVE IN AND GET CRACKING YOU KNOW 
I DON'T THINK WHEN MY SON COMES BACK OFF HOLIDAY I THINK HE'S QUITE EXCITED SO 
I'VE TOLD HIM ON THE TELEPHONE THAT HE'S GOT TO DO A LOT OF WORK 
BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT SUMMER 
NO MORE HOLIDAYS 
TO PAY YOU BACK YES THAT'S RIGHT CONGRATULATIONS I'M DELIGHTED IT'S TURNED OUT SO WELL FOR YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU GOOD LUCK WITH THE MOVE THANK YOU 
THERE'S JUST AN EMPTY SPACE 
JEREMY SHOULD MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT'S LEFT OF HIS HOLIDAY 
IT SOUNDS LIKE THEIR NEW FACTORY WILL BE HARD AT WORK IN NEXT TO NO TIME 
WELL IT SEEMS THAT FOR PETER AND HIS SON THEIR BUSINESS AND THIS PLACE ARE THE PERFECT MATCH 
IT SHOWS THERE'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY AT THE AUCTION 
FIND OUT HOW THEY GET ON SETTING IT UP HERE LATER IN THE SHOW 
FOR THE NEXT AUCTION PROPERTY I'VE COME TO THE BERKSHIRE MARKET TOWN OF WOKINGHAM 
IT'S POPULAR WITH COMMUTERS WITH ITS RAIL LINKS TO LONDON WATERLOO AND ROADS TO READING AND BRACKNELL 
THIS IS BARKHAM ROAD IN WOKINGHAM 
NOW AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S A REALLY BUSY ROAD AND CARS DO JUST THUNDER DOWN HERE BUT 
I'M A MILE FROM THE CENTRE OF TOWN AND THE TRAIN STATION IS A WALK AWAY SO IT'S PERFECTLY POSITIONED 
AND THE LOT I'M HERE TO SEE TODAY IS A TWO BEDROOM DETACHED BUNGALOW 
THE GUIDE PRICE WAS JUST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
IT'S NOT THE MOST IMPOSING PROPERTY BUT CONSIDERING 
IT WAS BUILT BEFORE THE SECOND WORLD WAR IT COULD BE A LOT WORSE 
YOU KNOW I USED TO LIVE IN A BUNGALOW AND I LOVED IT 
WE'VE GOT THE LIVING ROOM IT'S A GOOD SIZE 
THERE'S CENTRAL HEATING SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT EXPENSE 
THERE'S DOUBLE GLAZED WINDOWS AND A BEDROOM 
ALONG THIS BIT OF CORRIDOR THERE'S AN AIRING CUPBOARD AND 
ANOTHER REALLY GOOD SIZED BEDROOM AND THROUGH HERE IS A HUGE KITCHEN 
LOOK AT THIS 
NOW I'M NOT SURE THE NEW OWNERS WOULD LIKE THESE SHADES OF DUSKY PINK ON THE WALL 
A LITTLE BIT OF FRESH PAINT MIGHT REALLY BRIGHTEN THIS PLACE UP BUT IT'S A FANTASTIC SIZE 
SOME NEW UNITS IN HERE WOULD LOOK AMAZING 
THERE'S THIS NICE LITTLE SERVING HATCH IF THAT'S YOUR KIND OF THING BUT IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE 
MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT BUNGALOWS BUT I ALWAYS FEEL THEY OFFER YOU 
MORE SPACE AND THEY USUALLY SIT ON A GENEROUS PLOT AND IN THIS CASE IT SEEMS TO BE TRUE 
THE FRONT GARDEN IS BIGGER THAN THE WHOLE PLOT FOR MANY NEWBUILDS AND 
ROUND THE BACK OF THIS BUNGALOW YOU GET A REALLY BIG BIT OF BERKSHIRE 
NOW THIS IS A HUGE GARDEN O. K. YOU MAY NEED TO GET OUT THE LAWNMOWER AND YOUR CLIPPERS BUT 
ONCE DONE IT COULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR'S 
TO KEEP UP WITH THE JONESES YOU'LL NEED TO REFURBISH INSIDE AS WELL 
WE'VE SEEN WHAT THE KITCHEN NEEDS NOW LET'S CHECK OUT THE BATHROOM 
THERE ARE A FEW WAYS I WOULD LIKE TO UPDATE THIS BATHROOM 
RIP UP THIS CARPET BECAUSE CARPETS IN A BATHROOM ARE A NO NO 
YOU COULD REPLACE IT WITH TILES MAYBE UPDATE THE TAPS 
YOU'VE GOT A WHITE BATHROOM SUITE SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS AND GET RID OF 
THIS OLD HEATER UP HERE BUT OVERALL YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD SPACE TO WORK WITH 
LIKE MANY BUNGALOWS THE DIMENSIONS OF THE ROOMS ARE GENEROUS BUT IT'S THE FLOOR PLAN THAT LETS THEM DOWN 
YOU COULD MAKE MORE OF THE SPACE BY MOVING 
A WALL HERE AND A CUPBOARD THERE AND THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING 
THE AUCTION CATALOGUE HINTS AT REPLACEMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT BUT STANDING OUT HERE 
YOUR CHANCES OF REBUILDING WILL BE RESTRICTED BY THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THESE BUNGALOWS ON EITHER SIDE 
NOW BUZZ WORDS LIKE REPLACEMENT 
AND EXTENSION CAN SOMETIMES BE MISLEADING 
DON'T FORGET EVERYTHING IS SUBJECT TO PLANNING PERMISSION 
YOU CAN'T COUNT ON ANYTHING 
I THINK IT'S ALWAYS WORTH A PHONE CALL TO YOUR LOCAL COUNCIL 
YOU COULD PERHAPS LOOK AT SOME OLD APPROVED PLANS IN THE AREA 
JUST LOOK IN THE STREET TO SEE IF A PRECEDENT HAS BEEN SET YOU CAN EVEN TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBOURS 
DO ALL YOU CAN BEFORE AUCTION A CHAT WITH A LOCAL ESTATE AGENT CAN PAY DIVIDENDS 
THEY KNOW THE AREA BETTER THAN ANYONE SO IS THERE MUCH CHANCE THAT THIS PROPERTY CAN BE EXTENDED 
IT'S A BUNGALOW WE FEEL COULD EITHER BE EXTENDED OR MAYBE REDEVELOPED 
THERE ARE BUNGALOWS ON EITHER SIDE SO THE LOCAL AUTHORITY 
WOULD PROBABLY ONLY WANT TO SEE A BUNGALOW OR PERHAPS A CHALET AND IT'S GOT THAT POTENTIAL 
WITH THE SPACE AT THE BACK AND THE GARAGE IT COULD BE A POSSIBILITY 
HOWEVER IF THE PLANNERS REFUSE AN APPLICATION TO EXTEND 
WHAT WOULD THEN BE THE BEST WAY TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF THIS BUNGALOW 
IF SOMEBODY DECIDES TO KEEP THE BUNGALOW AS IT IS IT WOULD NEED A NEW BATHROOM NEW KITCHEN 
I THINK PROBABLY REWIRING CENTRAL HEATING AND REDECORATION AND NEW CARPETS 
THE GARDEN IS ONE OF THE MAIN FEATURES 
IT'S OVER ONE HUNDRED FEET DEEP IT'S BEEN WELL LOOKED AFTER SO IT'S GOT ESTABLISHED HEDGES AND 
WOULD CERTAINLY BE A FEATURE EITHER IF THE BUNGALOW IS RETAINED AS IT IS OR IT'S EXTENDED 
THIS BUNGALOW HAS ONLY GOT TWO BEDROOMS AND WENT TO THE AUCTION AT A GUIDE PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
BUT AFTER A GOOD QUALITY REFIT HOW MUCH COULD IT BE WORTH WITH OR WITHOUT EXTRA BEDROOMS 
IF SOMEBODY LEAVES IT AS A TWO BEDROOM BUNGALOW AND 
IMPROVES IT THE VALUE WOULD PROBABLY BE AROUND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
THE POTENTIAL TO EXTEND IT AND DEPENDING WHETHER IT WAS THREE OR FOUR BEDROOMS THE VALUE WOULD BE 
PROBABLY BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR A FOUR BEDROOM PROPERTY 
YOU'RE FACED WITH TWO OPTIONS HERE 
IMPROVEMENT OR REPLACEMENT OF THIS BUNGALOW 
THE QUICK MONEY IS IN IMPROVEMENT BUT THE BIG MONEY WOULD BE IN REPLACEMENT 
LET'S FIND OUT WHO BOUGHT IT WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN BARKHAM ROAD WOKINGHAM 
LET'S SAY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
TWO HUNDRED YES THANK YOU 
CAN I SAY TWO HUNDRED TEN TWO HUNDRED TEN NOW 
TWO HUNDRED TEN RIGHT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO 
I THOUGHT I WAS IN CHARGE OF THIS AUCTION 
AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR MADAM 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR SIR TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX 
DOESN'T NEED ME SO YOU HEARD THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY 
TWO HUNDRED SIXTY I'M BID TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO MAY I HAVE SIR 
YES THANK YOU 
TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THEN 
THE BIDDING IS WITH YOU SIR AT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO BIDDING WITH YOU SIR 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SECOND THIRD AND LAST TIME ARE WE ALL DONE WITH IT 
IT'S YOURS SIR 
THAT WINNING BID OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND WAS MADE BY ASHLEY 
HE'S A LOCAL LAD WHO BOUGHT THE BUNGALOW FOR HIS FIRST HOME 
HE LIVES WITH HIS PARENTS AND WORKS WITH HIS DAD NORMAN 
I MET UP WITH BOTH OF THEM BACK AT ASHLEY'S NEW RESIDENCE 
ASHLEY CONGRATULATIONS YOU MUST BE SO PLEASED I'M VERY PLEASED YES 
SO HAVE YOU BOUGHT THIS HOUSE FOR YOURSELF TO LIVE IN 
YEAH HOPEFULLY AS LONG AS I CAN KEEP UP THE PAYMENTS YEAH 
SO HOW OLD ARE YOU NOW SO AT TWENTY TWO HOW HAVE YOU MANAGED TO DO THIS 
I'VE GOT A BIG LUMP SUM BORROWED FROM MY DAD AND A MORTGAGE FOR THE REST OF IT 
THAT'S A NICE DAD THAT'S VERY NICE YES 
SO HE'S HELPED YOU OUT HAS HE HE HAS A GREAT DEAL YEAH SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING 
I WORK WITH MY DAD DOING CLASSIC CARS WE SPECIALISE IN A CERTAIN TYPE OF CLASSIC CAR 
WE BUY AND SELL THE CARS RESTORE THEM AND BREAK THEM DOWN FOR PARTS 
DO YOU HAVE A PASSION FOR CARS 
I DO LOVE CARS YEAH YEAH I LOVE CARS 
SO WHY DO YOU WANT THIS BUNGALOW SO MUCH 
IT'S A NICE AREA FOR ME IT'S CLOSE TO WHERE MY MUM AND DAD LIVE AND WHERE I LIVE AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S CLOSE TO THE TOWN WHERE ALL MY FRIENDS ARE 
WHERE I USUALLY SPEND MOST OF MY NIGHTS OUT SO IT WILL BE QUITE GOOD 
IT WILL BE A SHORT DRIVE BACK HOME AFTER WORKING WITH DAD ON THE CARS BUT SADLY 
THIS BUNGALOW IS NOT A CLASSIC AND RESTORATION WON'T BE EASY 
SO HOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF RENOVATING THIS PROPERTY 
WITH A LOT OF HELP FROM MY DAD AGAIN AND MY BROTHER HAS DONE STUFF LIKE THIS BEFORE 
HAVE YOU GOT ANY BUILDING SKILLS 
NOT REALLY I HAVE HELPED OUT MY BROTHER DID A PROPERTY WHICH I HELPED HIM OUT 
WITH DOING LITTLE BITS AND BOBS SO THERE'S A VERY VERY BASIC KNOWLEDGE THERE BUT I HOPE TO BUILD ON THAT 
CAN YOU PAINT A WALL I CAN PAINT A WALL YEAH YOU CAN PAINT A WALL AND 
YOU CAN CLEAN AND TIDY UP AND RIP UP FLOORING 
WE DID DO SOME LAMINATE FLOORING SO THAT PROBABLY HELPS 
ON THIS RENOVATION ASHLEY WILL GET HIS HANDS DIRTY WITH FILLER AND PAINT NOT OIL AND GREASE 
ASHLEY IN THE AUCTION CATALOGUE IT HINTED AT POSSIBLY EXTENDING 
THIS PROPERTY OR EVEN DEMOLISHING IT AND GOING FOR A NEWBUILD HERE 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT AND WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE A PLAN FOR MYSELF 
IT'S QUITE ADEQUATE REALLY I THINK FOR WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH IT 
THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING ANOTHER BEDROOM IN 
SO YOU'RE POSSIBLY GONNA CHANGE THE LAYOUT IN HERE YEAH A LITTLE BIT YEAH YEAH MAYBE 
YOU'LL UPDATE THIS KITCHEN OR WILL YOU RIP IT OUT 
UPDATE IT WE'LL TAKE ALL THE UNITS AND EVERYTHING OUT WILL YOU KEEP THE SERVING HATCH 
PROBABLY NOT NO IT WILL PROBABLY BE BRICKED UP 
SOME OF YOUR MATES WOULD BE QUITE HAPPY TO GET THEIR EGG AND CHIPS THROUGH HERE 
I RECKON ASHLEY'S BEEN HANDED A LOAN ON A PLATE FROM HIS DAD BUT HE'LL BE PAYING IT BACK A BIT 
AT A TIME JUST AS IF HE'D ARRANGED A MORTGAGE HIMSELF SO THE SOONER THE BUNGALOW'S FINISHED THE BETTER 
SO WHAT'S YOUR TIMESCALE HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU TO BE MOVING ALL YOUR STUFF IN 
HOPEFULLY WE'D LIKE TO GET IT COMPLETED WITHIN SIX MONTHS 
ARE YOU GONNA HAVE A BIG HOUSE WARMING PARTY 
HOPEFULLY YES DEFINITELY DOES DAD KNOW ABOUT THAT 
NOT YET NO 
AND THERE'S ANOTHER SECRET ASHLEY MIGHT WANT TO KEEP FROM DAD 
THIS GARAGE WOULD MAKE A GREAT STORE FOR ANY CLASSIC CAR AN ADDED BONUS TO ASHLEY'S TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND INVESTMENT 
NOW WHAT SORT OF BUDGET ARE YOU LOOKING AT TO DO THIS PLACE UP 
I'D LIKE TO KEEP IT WITHIN TEN BUT ALLOWING FIFTEEN THOUSAND FOR IT 
YOU'LL TRY TO KEEP UP THOSE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS YEAH A BIT OF OVERTIME FROM DAD WOULDN'T HURT YEAH 
ASHLEY'S DAD WILL DO A LOT OF THE WORK HERE WE NIPPED OUT TO THE GARDEN TO DISCUSS HIS PLANS 
NORMAN WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU TO HELP YOUR SON ON THE PROPERTY LADDER 
I JUST FEEL IF WE DON'T THEN HE'S NEVER GOING TO GET ON THE PROPERTY LADDER 
THEY'LL BE RENTING ALL THEIR LIFE AND I FEEL WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING HELP THEM OUT A BIT 
WILL YOU BE KEEPING A FIRM EYE ON WHAT'S GOING ON HERE I'LL BE HERE MOST DAYS YEAH YEAH 
I'LL BE DOING A LOT OF THE WORK SO HE'LL PICK UP DIFFERENT THINGS 
THAT HE CAN DO HIMSELF AND WHEN HE DOES SETTLE DOWN ONE DAY 
HE'LL BE ABLE TO DO A FEW JOBS HIMSELF YOU KNOW 
A BIT OF CHIPPING AND A BIT OF PLASTERING AND A BIT OF PLUMBING 
BUT HE'S YOUNG HE'S ONLY TWENTY TWO HE'S GOT THIS WHOLE GARDEN TO LOOK AFTER 
BEST TIME TO START BEST TIME TO START 
ARE YOU PREPARED TO GIVE HIM THAT TIME OFF WORK HE MIGHT NEED YEAH 
WELL WE'LL BE UP HERE TOGETHER BUT YOU CAN HAVE A COUPLE OF DAYS A WEEK MAYBE THREE DAYS UP HERE 
HE'S PLANNING ON A BIG PARTY HERE DOES THAT CONCERN YOU NOT TOO WORRIED HE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS 
SADLY THOUGH I DON'T THINK YOU'VE GOT AN INVITE NO PROBABLY NOT 
I'LL PROBABLY SNEAK IN THE BACK 
JUST KEEP THE NOISE DOWN AND DON'T DISTURB THE NEIGHBOURS 
FIRST TIME BUYER ASHLEY MADE A BRAVE MOVE IN BUYING THIS 
PURCHASING PROPERTY IN THE AUCTION ROOM IS HARROWING ENOUGH 
WITHOUT FIRST TIME BUYER NERVES ADDING TO THE STRESS LEVELS 
HE'S LUCKY ENOUGH THOUGH TO HAVE A DEDICATED DAD ON BOARD TO LEND HIM A HELPING HAND 
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SO SURE HE'LL GET AN INVITE TO THE HOUSEWARMING 
JOIN ME LATER TO SEE IF ASHLEY HAS MADE THIS A REAL HOME FROM HOME 
STILL TO COME THIS OLD RAILWAY COTTAGE IN STOKE ON TRENT HAS SOME FIRST CLASS POTENTIAL 
LOOK AT THIS ONE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT OF GARDEN 
BACK IN WOKINGHAM THE RENOVATION OF THIS BUNGALOW TAKES A NEW DIRECTION 
I GOT MADE AN OFFER WHICH I COULDN'T REALLY REFUSE I SUPPOSE 
BUT FIRST WE RETURN TO INDUSTRIAL SOMERSET 
JEREMY'S VERY DELIGHTED WITH THE WHOLE THING 
IT'S A BIG THING THAT I OWE HIM 
OF COURSE IT'S NOT JUST HOUSES THAT GO UP FOR AUCTION 
THERE ARE OFTEN SOME GREAT COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES UP FOR GRABS TOO LIKE THIS LARGE INDUSTRIAL 
BUILDING IN TEMPLE COOMBE SOMERSET 
IT WAS BOUGHT BY PETER FOR HIS SON JEREMY 
THEY RUN A TIMBER BUSINESS AND FELT THE TIME HAD COME TO EXPAND 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND LATER THE UNIT WAS ALL THEIRS 
IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS SINCE I MET PETER SO I WAS KEEN TO FIND OUT HOW THEY'D GOT ON 
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THIS BUILDING SINCE WE'VE MOVED IN IS 
WE'VE JUST PUT OUR EQUIPMENT IN HERE 
HAD AN ELECTRICIAN IN TO WIRE IT UP AND FITTED SOME EXTRACTION SYSTEMS AND 
STARTED WORK REALLY QUITE SIMPLE 
THEY'VE KNOCKED THIS BUILDING INTO SHAPE 
IT'S NOW FILLED WITH ALL THEIR MACHINERY AND BUSINESS IS CARRYING ON AS NORMAL 
KNOCK 
KNOCK ON WOOD 
EVERYBODY KNOCK 
KNOCK KNOCK ON WOOD 
PERSONALLY I'M THRILLED TO SEE THIS PROPERTY BEING USED AS IT IS 
REMEMBER I DID SAY IT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR SOMEBODY AND THAT TURNED OUT TO BE PETER AND JEREMY 
THEY'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE YARD OUT THE BACK AS WELL 
THE REASON WE DUG THE BANK OUT AT THE BACK IS THAT THERE'S ANOTHER SORT OF TWENTY FOOT OF LAND WHICH 
WOULD HAVE BEEN UNUSED SO WE'RE ABLE TO USE THAT NOW SO IT'S EXTRA YARD SPACE 
THIS SPACE NOW HAS SOME REAL POTENTIAL EITHER TO EXPAND THE CURRENT BUSINESS OR BE SOLD ON 
IT ONLY TOOK A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO REFIT THIS BUILDING WHICH MEANT THE BUSINESS HAD MINIMAL DISRUPTION 
NOW WITH JEREMY BACK FROM HIS HOLIDAYS IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL 
EVEN THOUGH PETER HAS RETIRED AND COULD BE ON THE GOLF COURSE THIS IS A PART OF HIS LIFE HE LOVES 
ONE OF THE PERKS OF BEING RETIRED IS I DON'T GET UP 
UNTIL EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEREAS IT USED TO BE HALF PAST SIX 
HE HELPS ME OUT WITH ADVISORY WORK 
HE'S BEEN IN THE BUSINESS FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND HE COMES IN 
PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY JUST TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING AND CHECKING THAT I'M DOING O. K. 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHEN THE NEXT GENERATION COMES ON THAT 
THEY ARE THE NEXT GENERATION AND THEY KNOW BEST REALLY AND 
SO I THINK IT WORKS VERY WELL I'M GOB SMACKED AT SOME OF THE THINGS HE DOES YOU KNOW 
I THINK COR WISH I COULD DO THAT 
JEREMY IS CERTAINLY A CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK AND WITH HIS DAD 
DRIVING AROUND THE COUNTRY SETTING UP NEW JOBS THINGS ARE GOING WELL 
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A DOG'S LIFE 
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT 
WHO WHO WHO WHO 
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT 
WHO WHO 
IT'S NEARLY MANDATORY TO HAVE A DOG IF YOU WORK FOR US 
WHO WHO WHO WHO 
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT 
THAT'S NOT STRICTLY TRUE BUT IT SEEMS TO BE AND I'VE GOT TWO AND MY SON'S GOT ONE AND NEIL OUR 
FOREMAN'S GOT ONE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO COMES OVER IF THEY WANT TO BRING THEIR DOG THEY CAN 
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A JOKE WITH OUR COMPANY FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS 
WE HAVE THE DOGS WANDERING AROUND IN THE YARD AND IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE YOUR PET ALONG 
IT'S A THING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WORK CAN'T DO AND IT'S GOOD 
WITH THE NEW YARD TO EXPLORE I THINK THE DOGS ARE HAPPY WITH THEIR NEW OFFICES TOO 
IT'S BEEN AN EASY MOVE FOR THE COMPANY 
THEY PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THE PLACE WHICH WAS CHEAPER THAN BUILDING ONE 
FROM SCRATCH BUT HAS IT COST MUCH TO MOVE 
I'M NOT CERTAIN BUT I WOULD GUESS AT 
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE THOUSAND TO DO THE ELECTRICS AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
POSSIBLY A TOTAL OF FIVE THOUSAND 
SO A TOTAL COST OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND TO RESHAPE THE FUTURE OF 
THIS TIMBER BUSINESS AND FOR PETER AND JEREMY IT'S MONEY WELL SPENT 
YEAH MOVING TO THE SITE HAS 
CERTAINLY IMPROVED OUR SITUATION FROM OUR OLD SITE 
IT'S A LOT CLEANER 
LESS MUD AND YEAH CERTAINLY A LOT BRIGHTER TO WORK FROM 
I THINK THIS WAS A VERY GOOD BUY FOR JEREMY AND I THINK IT WILL PROVE SO IN THE LONG RUN 
SOMEWHERE 
OVER THE RAINBOW 
WELL THERE'S NO POT OF GOLD BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY A BRIGHT OUTLOOK FOR THIS BUSINESS 
PETER AND JEREMY PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND IN TOTAL TO BUY AND MOVE INTO THEIR NEW PREMISES 
SO WHAT WILL TWO LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS MAKE OF THEIR HARD WORK AND THAT PLOT OF LAND BEHIND 
THEY'RE A LOCAL FIRM 
THIS IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR AREA SO IT SUITS THEM VERY WELL 
IT PROVIDES THEM WITH PLENTY OF SPACE OUTSIDE NICE WORKING AREA INSIDE 
THEY FITTED IT OUT TO SUIT THEM SO IT'S IDEAL FOR THEM 
THIS IS A TYPICAL USE FOR THE AREA TRADITIONAL INDUSTRY 
THE PROPERTY IS VERY WELL SUITED TO WOODWORKING AND JOINERY 
THAT THEY'RE USING THE UNIT FOR AND THE STORAGE 
THEY COULD DEVELOP THE REAR 
PUT ANOTHER BUILDING IN THE BACK WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE VALUE AND MAKE A BETTER USE OF THE SITE 
PROPERTIES LIKE THIS HOLD THEIR VALUE WELL AND 
THEY'RE NOT AS VOLATILE AS SOME PROPERTY INVESTMENTS ARE 
WITH COMMERCIAL PREMISES THEIR VALUE IS WHATEVER PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY 
THIS ONE COST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AT AUCTION JUST TWO MONTHS AGO SO IT WON'T HAVE CHANGED MUCH 
THE REAL VALUE IS IN THE BUSINESS HAVING ROOM TO GROW 
BUT THAT YARD AT THE BACK MAY JUST HAVE GIVEN THEM A PROFIT MARGIN 
IF THEY CAN GET PLANNING PERMISSION THEN IT WILL PROBABLY INCREASE THE VALUE BY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
IF THE PROPERTY AT THE BACK OBTAINED A SEPARATE PLANNING CONSENT 
THE VALUE COULD BE ENHANCED THERE BY SOMETHING IN EXCESS OF THIRTY THOUSAND 
VERY GOOD YEAH VERY GOOD IDEAL 
DEFINITELY CONSIDER PUTTING AN APPLICATION IN WE HAD ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT MIND 
SO IT'S GOOD NEWS 
OVERALL THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR A RETURN EITHER AS BIGGER PREMISES OR BY SELLING OFF THE PLOT 
BUT FOR NOW BUSINESS IS GOING WELL ON THE NEW SITE AND I DON'T SEE THEM MOVING ANYTIME SOON 
WHAT DO THEY THINK NOW THEY'RE ALL SETTLED 
YEAH I THINK IT'S A GOOD MOVE FOR THE FUTURE AND 
LOOK FORWARD TO MANY YEARS OF WORKING HERE 
WELL OUTSIDE IT'S RAINING CATS AND WELL THE DOGS ARE SAFELY INSIDE 
WHERE THE BUSINESS NOW HAS ROOM TO GROW 
ALTHOUGH JEREMY IS NOW THE BOSS HE'S PLEASED THAT HIS DAD ISN'T 
PLANNING TO HANG UP HIS CHISEL JUST YET 
AS LONG AS HE'LL HAVE ME YEAH YEAH 
THIS IS BROWNLEES IN STAFFORDSHIRE 
THERE USED TO BE A FOUNDRY AND A MINE HERE AND THESE 
COTTAGES BEHIND ME WERE BUILT TO HOUSE THE MINE WORKERS 
THEY'RE CALLED RAILWAY COTTAGES WHICH GIVES CAUSE FOR CONCERN 
BECAUSE IT MEANS THERE'S A ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE INTERCITY LINE NEARBY 
IN THIS CASE NOT THAT IS THE RAILWAY LINE 
IT'S DISUSED 
WHAT KIND OF STATE IS THE PROPERTY IN 
FROM THE OUTSIDE IT LOOKS IN GREAT SHAPE 
IT WAS BUILT IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS BY ROBERT HEATH A LOCAL BUSINESSMAN WHO WAS 
ONCE THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRODUCER OF BAR IRON 
HE ALSO MADE FOUR WHEEL TRAINS AND THE TRACKS AT THE BACK OF 
THE HOUSE LED TO HIS STEELWORKS SO THERE'S AN INTERESTING HISTORY ATTACHED TO THIS PROPERTY 
WOW THAT'S A NICE SURPRISE OFTEN WITH COTTAGES LIKE THIS YOU SORT OF WALK THROUGH THE FRONT 
DOOR AND IT'S QUITE OPPRESSIVE BUT NOT THIS ONE IT'S GOT A NICE FEEL 
SOMEBODY'S KNOCKED THROUGH THE LOUNGE INTO 
THE SITTING ROOM BUT IT'S CREATED THIS ONE REALLY NICE BIG SPACE 
AND AS A CENTREPIECE WOW 
WHAT A FIREPLACE 
NICE USE OF WOOD BUT NO IT'S AN OPEN FIRE WE LOVE THAT 
NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE DESIGN BUT THAT'S EASILY CHANGED IT'S A GOOD START YEAH 
LET'S GO TO THE KITCHEN 
IT ALL GETS WEIRD AT THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY THOUGH 
THIS IS THE KITCHEN AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S VERY LONG AND NARROW 
YOU COULD DO SOMETHING WITH THIS STICK A GALLEY KITCHEN HERE 
BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS BACK THERE BECAUSE THROUGH THE SHUTTERED 
UTILITY ROOM AREA IS THE ONLY LOO IN THE PROPERTY AND THE BATHROOM IS ACTUALLY SEPARATE AND 
DOWN ANOTHER SET OF CORRIDORS JUST OVER THERE SO BIT OF A STRANGE LAYOUT 
NOW I'M A BIG FAN OF KEEPING A TOILET DOWNSTAIRS BUT HAVING 
THE BATHROOM DOWN HERE TOO DOESN'T WORK SO WELL SO LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ROOM TO MOVE IT UPSTAIRS 
SO UPSTAIRS THREE BEDROOMS BUT THERE IS A CAVEAT TO THAT 
WHICH I'LL COME ONTO IN A SECOND BUT THAT'S THE FRONT ONE NICE SIZE 
NICE VIEWS OUT WE LIKE THAT IT'S GOT A REALLY NICE FEEL TO IT AND 
THE ORIGINAL DOORS WHICH IS A DELIGHT SECOND BEDROOM HERE 
AGAIN NOT A BAD SIZE 
BUT THE THIRD BEDROOM IS NOT IDEAL AT ALL BECAUSE YOU 
HAVE TO PASS THROUGH THE SECOND BEDROOM TO FIND IT 
IT'S A SMALLER BOX ROOM SO O. K. IT'S NOT A BAD SIZE BUT AS I SAID THE BIG ISSUE IS 
YOU GO THROUGH THAT SECOND BEDROOM TO GET TO IT AND I HAVE TO SHOW THIS WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THIS IS THE HOT WATER CYLINDER 
IT'S A MAJOR FEATURE IN THE ROOM 
IT'S GOT A LITTLE BLANKET ON IT TO KEEP IT WARM HOW CUTE IS THAT 
WELL I THINK THE PERFECT SOLUTION WOULD BE TO SACRIFICE SOME OF 
THE SECOND BEDROOM TO CREATE A CORRIDOR THROUGH TO BEDROOM THREE 
THEN I CONVERT BEDROOM THREE INTO A FAMILY BATHROOM 
IT MAY SEEM A BAD DECISION TO LOSE A BEDROOM BUT HERE'S THE TWIST 
UPSTAIRS THERE'S A LOFT ROOM WHICH WOULD MAKE A VERY LARGE DOUBLE BEDROOM WITH THE ADDITION OF 
A FEW SKYLIGHTS OR EVEN A DORMER IF PLANNING PERMISSION WAS GRANTED 
WHATEVER THE BUYER DOES THERE'S SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT HERE 
SO A BIT OF A STRANGE LAYOUT BUT IN GENERAL 
A NICE COTTAGE WITH A GOOD FEEL TO IT AND REASONABLE SIZE BUT 
THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU WHICH MAKES IT INTERESTING AND THAT'S HERE AT THE BACK 
ONE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT OF GARDEN NOW IT'S GOT ALL THESE SHEDS THAT YOU WANT TO GET RID OF 
BUT WHAT ABOUT USING THIS AS SOME KIND OF BUILDING PLOT 
MAYBE PUT ANOTHER HOUSE HERE 
SOUNDS GREAT 
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT THERE IS A COVENANT WHICH GOES ALONG WITH THE SALE OF 
THIS HOUSE WHICH SAYS THAT IF YOU DO BUILD SOMETHING ON THERE 
THE PERSON WHO BUYS THIS HAS TO PAY THE CURRENT OWNER FIFTY PER CENT OF ANY PROFIT THEY GOT FROM WHATEVER THEY BUILD 
THAT'S NOT NICE 
SO WITH PLANS FOR DEVELOPING THE BACK GARDEN DERAILED I ASKED A LOCAL AGENT TO PUT HIS TRAINING 
TO GOOD USE AND FIND OUT WHETHER THAT COVENANT AFFECTS EXTENDS THE COTTAGE ITSELF 
JUST EXTENDING WOULD CARRY NOTHING WITH THE COVENANT 
IT WOULD ONLY BE IF PLANNING PERMISSION WAS OBTAINED TO DEVELOP THE SITE TO THE SIDE 
WELL THAT'S A RELIEF 
AT LEAST THE HOUSE DOESN'T HAVE ANY COVENANTS ATTACHED 
ONCE THE HOUSE HAS BEEN REVAMPED WHAT PROFIT COULD THE BUYER EXPECT ON A GUIDE PRICE OF AROUND NINETY THOUSAND 
WHEN WE LOOK AT BASING OUR FIGURES WE LOOK AT COMPARABLE EVIDENCE AND THE TERRACED PROPERTIES 
IN THE ROW HERE THE TWO BEDROOM ONES WHICH ARE MUCH SMALLER WITH MUCH LESS GROUND TEND TO ACHIEVE 
IN A MODERNISED CONDITION AROUND NINETY FIVE THOUSAND MAYBE ONE HUNDRED SO WITH THIS 
HAVING THREE BEDROOMS AND END TERRACE AND OF COURSE A MUCH LARGER PLOT TO THE SIDE AND OFF ROAD PARKING 
FULLY MODERNISED I'D GUESS WE'D ESTIMATE SOMEWHERE AROUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE TO ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
THAT IS A HEALTHY MARGIN AND IF THE BUYER HANGS ONTO THE PROPERTY FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE COVENANT 
ON THE GARDEN EXPIRES SO THERE'S SCOPE FOR MORE PROFIT IN THE FUTURE 
SO A RAILWAY COTTAGE WITHOUT A RAILWAY AND 
A PLOT OF LAND THAT YOU CAN'T BUILD ON WITHOUT PAYING FIFTY PER CENT OF ANY PROFITS TO THE CURRENT OWNER OF THIS PLACE 
STILL IT'S ONLY NINETY THOUSAND AND I'M SURE IT WAS A POPULAR LOT AT THE AUCTION 
WHAT'S THIS EIGHTY TO START ME ON THIS ONE 
LOT FORTY TWO 
THREE BEDROOMS LOFT ROOM AS WELL 
EIGHTY TO START ME 
EIGHTY I'M BID THANK YOU AT EIGHTY THOUSAND 
EIGHTY FIVE CAN I SAY NOW AT EIGHTY THOUSAND 
EIGHTY FIVE ANYWHERE AT EIGHTY THOUSAND 
LOOKING FOR EIGHTY FIVE NOW EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND 
AT EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND NINETY IS IT AT EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND 
NINETY IT IS AT NINETY THOUSAND ANOTHER FIVE 
AT NINETY THOUSAND TAKE ONE IF IT HELPS 
AT NINETY THOUSAND NINETY ONE ANYWHERE 
AT NINETY THOUSAND NINETY ONE THOUSAND 
NINETY TWO NINETY THREE NINETY FOUR NINETY FIVE NINETY SIX NINETY SEVEN 
AT NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND 
AT NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND NINETY EIGHT IS IT 
AT NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND THEN ALL WE ALL DONE 
NINETY EIGHT ANYWHERE ELSE 
NINETY EIGHT ON THE FRONT ROW AT NINETY EIGHT 
NINETY NINE IS IT NINETY NINE 
ONE HUNDRED 
ANYONE AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ON THE FRONT ROW 
AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ANOTHER ONE 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE BID'S ON THE FRONT ROW AGAINST YOU LEFT AGAINST YOU RIGHT 
THE BID'S HERE AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
ARE WE ALL DONE I'M SELLING IT THEN AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AGAINST YOU SIR AGAINST YOU THE BID IS IN 
AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ARE WE ALL DONE 
YOU BOUGHT IT WELL DONE 
THE WINNING BIDDER WAS ROSEMARY 
SHE RETIRED FROM MANAGING CARE HOMES FOR ADULTS WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES TO DABBLE IN PROPERTY 
IN FACT ROSEMARY HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE AN OFFER TO THE OWNER BUT IT WAS WITHDRAWN FROM SALE 
I DID TRY TO BUY IT BEFORE THE AUCTION ACTUALLY SEALED BIDS RIGHT TELL ME MORE 
WE GOT A CHANCE TO PURCHASE IT AT ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND BUT THEN THEY SAID NO 
THEY WERE GOING TO SEND IT TO AUCTION AND YOU PAID ONE HUNDRED I PAID ONE HUNDRED 
HOW'S THAT FOR A BIT OF DIVINE JUSTICE 
ELEVEN THOUSAND YES SO I WAS VERY PLEASED 
SO WHAT'S THE APPEAL TO YOU OF GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS KIND OF PROJECT 
I JUST LOVE HOUSES 
LOVE HOUSES AND DOING THINGS TO THEM 
SO IS THIS SOMETHING YOU'VE GOT EXPERIENCE OF IS IT SOMETHING YOU'VE DONE BEFORE OR 
I'VE DONE MY OWN PROPERTIES UP BEFORE YOU KNOW SO I'VE JUST SORT OF SOLD ON AND MOVED 
AND DONE ANOTHER ONE AND HOPEFULLY JUST MOVED UP THE LADDER 
A LITTLE BIT OVER THE LAST OOH ABOUT THE LAST FIFTEEN TWENTY T. H. S. YEARS 
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE HOUSE 
I'M GOING TO PUT A NEW BATHROOM NEW KITCHEN AND PROBABLY THE BATHROOM 
WILL GO UPSTAIRS IT'S IN THE OUTHOUSE DOWNSTAIRS HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SET ASIDE FOR THE WORK 
I HOPE I MIGHT DO IT FOR THE ELEVEN THOUSAND THAT I SAVED AT THE AUCTION THAT WOULD BE GREAT WOULDN'T IT 
HOPEFULLY I WON'T NEED TO SPEND MUCH MORE THAN THAT 
RAILWAY COTTAGE IS PERFECT FOR ROSEMARY BECAUSE SHE HAS A CONNECTION TO 
A VERY FAMOUS BRAND OF MODEL TRAINS 
OUR GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER HELPED DESIGN THE HORNBY RAILWAY 
WHAT LIKE THE DOUBLE O. AND THE WHOLE THING YES YES WOW 
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THAT 
WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT UP AND DISPLAY SOME AND PROBABLY PUT A TRACK UP AS WELL 
WHERE PROBABLY UPSTAIRS SOMEWHERE IN THIS HOUSE 
YES BECAUSE I THINK MY SON'S GOING TO LIVE HERE EVENTUALLY 
WHEN I'VE ORGANISED ALL THE RENOVATION AND EVERYTHING 
SO IT'S A RAILWAY COTTAGE WITH ITS OWN RAILWAY 
YES IT'S GOING TO BE CALLED HORNBY COTTAGE 
THAT'S A GREAT STORY 
I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK AND PLAY ON THAT 
ROSEMARY WAS DESTINED TO BUY THIS COTTAGE AND 
WASN'T GOING TO BE RAILROADED BY THE COVENANTS ATTACHED TO THE HOUSE 
WHAT WAS IT YOU LIKED ABOUT THE HOUSE 
IT'S A BIT QUIRKY ISN'T IT YEAH AND THE LAND I LIKE THE LAND AS WELL 
BUT I KNEW ABOUT ALL THE COVENANTS THAT WERE ON THE LAND TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT THEM 
IT'S TWENTY FIVE YEARS YOU CAN'T REALLY DO AN AWFUL LOT WITHOUT GIVING FIFTY PER CENT BACK 
MM IT'S A BIT ROUGH THAT ISN'T IT 
YEAH BUT AFTER THAT IT'S ALL YOURS SO EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY MAYBE THE GRANDCHILDREN 
WILL BENEFIT BY THAT IF WE STILL HAVE THE COTTAGE BY THEN 
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE BUILDING IT IN FOR THE FAMILY FUTURE THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING ALL THIS RENOVATING FOR 
GREAT CONGRATULATIONS AND GOOD LUCK THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WELL IT SEEMS THAT THIS PURCHASE WAS MEANT TO BE FOR ROSEMARY 
BIG QUESTION NOW IS WILL HORNBY COTTAGE BE A RUNAWAY SUCCESS OR SHUNTED INTO THE SIDINGS 
YOU CAN FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW 
TIME HAS SIMPLY FLOWN BY BUT HAVE OUR BUYERS MADE ANY PROGRESS WITH THEIR PROPERTIES 
LET'S GO BACK AND FIND OUT 
IN THE BERKSHIRE TOWN OF WOKINGHAM LOCAL LAD ASHLEY HAD BOUGHT THIS BUNGALOW FOR TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND 
IT WAS TO BE HIS FIRST HOME 
HE'S TWENTY TWO CURRENTLY LIVES AT HOME AND WORKS WITH HIS FATHER NORMAN RESTORING CLASSIC CARS 
IT WAS HIS DAD TO INVESTED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE PROJECT 
WHILE ASHLEY TOOK OUT A MORTGAGE OF SEVENTY THOUSAND TO FUND THE BALANCE AND DO THE REFURBISHMENT 
TWELVE WEEKS LATER WE'RE BACK AT THE PROPERTY TO CATCH UP WITH ASHLEY AND NORMAN 
THE BIG CHANGES ARE INSIDE THE BUNGALOW 
THE CHIMNEY BREASTS HAVE BEEN ATTACKED IN THE TWO FRONT ROOMS 
AND THE SERVING HATCH IN THE KITCHEN IS NOW HISTORY 
IN FACT A LOT OF THE KITCHEN HAS BEEN HIT WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER 
IT CONTINUES IN THE BEDROOM AND THE BATHROOM 
THERE ARE CERTAINLY A LOT OF BRICKS ON SHOW BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WORK HAS GROUND TO A HALT 
THE FIRST WEEK WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WE CAME HERE FOR ABOUT HALF A DAY RIPPED A FEW OLD BITS OUT CLEARED 
IT OUT A BIT CHUCKED OUT A BIT OF RUBBISH AND THAT'S ABOUT IT WE HAVEN'T BEEN BACK HERE SINCE REALLY 
SO WHAT EXACTLY HAS BEEN ACHIEVED 
NOT A LOT WE'VE SPENT PROBABLY ABOUT HALF A DAY MAYBE A DAY ALL 
IN ALL JUST RIPPING A FEW THINGS OUT AND GOT MADE AN OFFER WHICH I COULDN'T REALLY REFUSE I SUPPOSE 
AN OFFER YOU CAN'T REFUSE 
THIS IS WOKINGHAM NOT SICILY 
BUT IT IS STILL A FAMILY BUSINESS 
MY OTHER SON MY ELDEST SON BUMPED INTO AN OLD FRIEND OF HIS 
WHO MENTIONED THAT HE KNEW A LADY THAT WANTED TO GET TO THE AUCTION AND 
BUY THE PROPERTY AND SHE COULDN'T MAKE IT 
SHE SAID SHE DESPERATELY WANTED IT 
POSTMAN PAT 
POSTMAN PAT 
POSTMAN PAT AND HIS BLACK AND WHITE CAT 
THE LADY IN QUESTION IS PAM NOT PAT BUT SHE DOES RUN THE LOCAL POST OFFICE 
I SAW THE HOUSE HAD COME UP FOR AUCTION AND I WAS FULLY INTENDING TO GO TO THE AUCTION AND BID FOR IT 
BUT I'M A POSTMISTRESS AND I WAS STUCK IN THE POST OFFICE AND I JUST LITERALLY COULDN'T ESCAPE 
TO BE ABLE TO COME OUT AND BUY IT SO I JUST GAVE UP AND THOUGHT IT OBVIOUSLY WASN'T MEANT TO BE 
BUT WHEN PAM HEARD THAT ASHLEY AND NORMAN 
HAD BOUGHT THE BUNGALOW SHE GOT IN TOUCH AND ARRANGED TO MEET UP 
SHE'S SINCE HAD A MEETING WITH US SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE PLACE AS IT IS AT THE MOMENT 
I DIDN'T THINK SHE'D BUY IT 
SHE HAD A LOOK ROUND SHE SAID NO I WANT IT I'VE GOT TO HAVE IT AND THAT WAS IT 
WE STRUCK A DEAL AND SINCE THEN WE'VE EXCHANGED AND IT COMPLETES IN A COUPLE OF DAYS 
PAM PAID THEM THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR IT SO THAT'S A THIRTY EIGHT GRAND PROFIT AFTER JUST THREE MONTHS NICE WORK 
THEY'RE DELIGHTED AS IS PAM IN FACT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY IS PLEASED 
THE PEOPLE I'VE TOLD ARE THRILLED TO BITS BECAUSE THEY KNEW THE LADY THAT USED TO LIVE HERE AS I DID 
AND THEY'RE ALL SAYING YOU'RE BUYING EVE'S HOUSE 
THAT'S WONDERFUL BECAUSE IT'S STILL IN BARKHAM OR IT STILL BELONGS TO PEOPLE WE KNOW 
SO ASHLEY'S FIRST HOUSE PURCHASE HAS RESULTED IN A PROFIT BUT NOT A HOME 
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE BUNGALOW IS A FIRST FOR PAM AS WELL 
I HAVE NEVER BOUGHT A HOUSE ON MY OWN BEFORE 
MY LATE HUSBAND AND I BOUGHT THE POST OFFICE AND TO ACTUALLY DO IT COMPLETELY ON MY OWN 
BUT UNLIKE HIS BANK ACCOUNT NORMAN HAS GOT A BIT OF AN EMPTY FEELING 
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING THE WORK COS WE WERE 
GETTING A BIT SLACK IN WHAT WE DO AT HOME WITH THE CLASSIC CARS SO I WAS 
LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING THE WORK AND GETTING HIM INTO HIS FIRST PROPERTY BUT HE'LL FIND SOMETHING ELSE 
I FEEL THE PROFIT ON THIS PROPERTY HAS PERHAPS GIVEN ME AN INTEREST TO LOOK INTO IT A BIT MORE AND MAYBE 
TRY AND DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO PUT WORK INTO THE NEXT ONE 
WELL THE BOYS HAVE GOT THEIR PROFIT OUT OF THIS PROPERTY BUT PAM'S PAID THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR IT AND 
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO DO SO HAS SHE MADE TOO MUCH OR IS THERE A PROFIT FOR HER AS WELL 
LET'S ASK TWO LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS 
THIS IS A LOVELY PROPERTY QUITE A STRONG PROPERTY 
I THINK IT'S GOOD HUGE POTENTIAL 
IT WILL BE LOVELY WHEN IT'S DONE UP AND ITS LOCATION IS EXCELLENT 
HAVING LOOKED AT IT AGAIN I CAN SEE THE POTENTIAL NOW 
SOME OF THE WORK HAS BEEN DONE 
THERE'S MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND 
A NEW KITCHEN AND NEW BATHROOM AND REDECORATING TO MAKE IT LOOK REALLY GOOD 
THE GARDEN LOOKS A LOVELY SIZE 
IT'S VERY PROPORTIONAL TO THIS PROPERTY AND IT'S VERY PRETTY 
I LOVE GARDENING BUT THE GARDEN I'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT IS 
AT LEAST TWICE THE SIZE OF THIS ONE AND IT'S TOO BIG 
PAM WILL HAVE TO GET THE BUNGALOW REFURBISHED SO HOW MUCH WOULD IT BE WORTH ONCE THE WORK'S COMPLETED 
I THINK ONCE THE WORK HAS BEEN FINISHED AND ASSUMING IT'S 
FINISHED TO A REASONABLE STANDARD I WOULD THINK THE VALUE AS A TWO BEDROOM BUNGALOW IS AROUND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
WE'D EXPECT WITH THE OTHER BUNGALOWS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE AREA THAT IF IT WAS DONE AS IS AND 
REMAINS A TWO BEDROOM PROPERTY WE'D PROBABLY SEE A PRICE TAG BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY AND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE 
WE THOUGHT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE TO THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE WHEN FINISHED YOU KNOW AFTER SPENDING PERHAPS FIFTEEN TO TWENTY THOUSAND ON 
A NEW KITCHEN BATHROOM YEAH THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT 
AT THOSE PRICES THAT MEANS THERE'S A PROFIT FOR PAM AFTER ALL WHICH IS GREAT NEWS EVERYONE'S A WINNER 
BUT ARE THE BOYS DISAPPOINTED NOT TO BE GETTING STUCK INTO THE RENOVATION WORK THEMSELVES 
NO WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT VERY PLEASED YEAH 
WE'VE MADE A PROFIT AND IT'S GIVEN HIM A GOOD DEPOSIT FOR THE NEXT PROPERTY 
SO ON THE NEXT PROPERTY WILL ASHLEY ROPE DAD IN AGAIN TO HELP WITH THE FINANCES AND THE WORK 
I EXPECT HE'LL FIND SOMETHING AND HE'LL WANNA DRAG ME INTO IT I'M SURE I'LL NEED HIM AGAIN 
SO I'LL BE AROUND MOST OF THE TIME AND I EXPECT WE'LL 
DO UP SOMETHING BETWEEN US AND THEN HE'LL MOVE IN AND ENJOY IT 
IF PROPERTY NUMBER TWO DOES TURN OUT TO BE A FINANCIAL WINNER 
LIKE THIS FIRST ONE HIS DAD WILL BE PLEASED 
BEATS LEAVING MONEY IN THE BUILDING SOCIETY 
TROUBLE IS ASHLEY WILL HAVE TO CARRY ON LIVING AT HOME 
IF HE DOESN'T GET A HOUSE HE CAN MOVE INTO 
ROSEMARY BOUGHT THIS RAILWAY COTTAGE IN STOKE ON TRENT FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WITH THE HELP OF HER SON SHE PLANNED TO RENOVATE IT INTO A FAMILY HOME 
THE COVENANT PROTECTING THE LARGE GARDEN DIDN'T PUT ROSEMARY OFF 
AS IT WAS THE COTTAGE ITSELF THAT ATTRACTED HER 
SHE PLANNED TO GET AS MUCH FROM IT AS POSSIBLE 
THREE MONTHS ON I WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THIS RAILWAY COTTAGE HAD KEPT TO ITS TIMETABLE 
A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE WE LAST WERE HERE 
WE'VE PUT AN EXTENSION ON WHICH HAS TOTALLY TRANSFORMED IT I THINK 
ALTHOUGH THE TRAIN TRACK BEHIND THIS COTTAGE HASN'T BEEN USED FOR SOME TIME IT'S CLEAR THAT ROSEMARY 
AND HER SON HAVE STEAMED AHEAD WITH THE RENOVATION 
GIVE ME STEAM 
HOW YOU FEEL CAN MAKE YOU REAL 
REAL AS ANYTHING YOU'VE SEEN 
GET A LIFE 
WITH A DREAMER'S DREAM 
IN THIS ROOM WE'VE ACTUALLY COMPLETELY GUTTED THE WHOLE ROOM 
WE'VE REPLACED THE RSJ WHICH WAS ACTUALLY HERE AND WE'VE MOVED IT OVER A METRE 
WE'VE KNOCKED THROUGH AND MADE AN INGLENOOK FIREPLACE 
THERE WAS ORIGINALLY A RADIATOR THERE 
WE'VE ALSO ADDED A NEW STAIRCASE TO THE RIGHT OF THE BUILDING 
THE NEXT JOB IS TO ACTUALLY PLASTER AND UP TO NOW IT'S BEEN WELL WE'RE HAPPY WITH IT 
THAT COVENANT PREVENTED BUILDING INTO THE GARDEN BUT IT DIDN'T STOP 
THEM FROM EXTENDING THE COTTAGE WHICH THEY'VE DONE WELL INTERNALLY EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THE PLACE USED TO BE 
THE EXTENSION HAS MEANT MOVING THE FRONT DOOR TO THE SIDE ADDING 
THIS ROOFTOP TERRACE LEADING OFF THE MAIN BEDROOM AND CREATING MORE SPACE DOWNSTAIRS 
WE HAVE AN OFFICE 
WE ALSO HAVE A FOYER 
I THINK WE'VE GOT A GRAND ENTRANCE WITH THE TWO DOUBLE DOORS 
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE ARE TWO PILLARS IT'S NEARLY FINISHED IN THIS SECTION HERE WE'LL HAVE 
TWO DOUBLE DOORS WHICH WILL LEAD ONTO THE MAIN LIVING ROOM AND WE'RE HAPPY WITH IT SO FAR 
UPSTAIRS THE ROOMS HAVE BEEN RECONFIGURED TOO MAKING THIS A FOUR OR EVEN FIVE BEDROOM PROPERTY 
A NEW STAIRCASE HAS BEEN INSTALLED AS WELL AS NEW HEATING WIRING AND WINDOWS IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH 
WE'VE PUT A NEW KITCHEN ON 
WE'VE ADDED AN AUDIO SYSTEM WE'VE ALSO ADDED DOWNLIGHTERS TO THE WHOLE PROPERTY 
THERE'S A BIG FOYER 
WE'VE ADDED INTERNET ACCESS 
WE'VE ADDED NEW FLOORS STAIRCASE AND WE'RE HAPPY SO FAR 
THE CONVERSION IS UNUSUAL 
THEY'VE EFFECTIVELY TURNED THE HOUSE ROUND NINETY DEGREES SO IT NOW FACES THAT LAND 
ONCE FINISHED IT WILL LOOK FANTASTIC AND THE MAN BEHIND THE DESIGNS IS MARK 
I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN THE ARCHITECT AND NOW I THINK EVERYBODY CAN SEE 
THE PLANS COMING TOGETHER THAT HAVE BEEN IN MY SIGHT FOR SO LONG 
THE RAILWAY BACKGROUND OF THIS COTTAGE IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS ROSEMARY BOUGHT IT 
THIS IS BECAUSE WHILE TRACING HER FAMILY HISTORY SHE DISCOVERED ONE OF HER ANCESTORS 
HAD HELPED DESIGN THE FAMOUS HORNBY TRAIN SET SO AS WELL AS RENAMING THE HOUSE HORNBY COTTAGE 
SHE HAS ALSO TRACKED DOWN AN OLD SET 
YES WE DID BUY THE TRAIN SET OFF THE OLD CHAPPIE DOWN IN THE VILLAGE 
AND HE'S REALLY PLEASED THAT IT'S COMING TO A NICE RAILWAY COTTAGE 
SHE PAID ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THIS COTTAGE AND THE RENOVATION SEEMS TO BE ON SCHEDULE 
OTHER THAN A CHANGE OF BUILDING TEAM MARK AND ROSEMARY ARE HAPPY WITH PROGRESS 
HOWEVER THE EXTENSION WASN'T IN THE ORIGINAL PLANS SO HOW HAS THAT AFFECTED THE BUDGET 
THE ORIGINAL BUDGET WAS ELEVEN THOUSAND ROUGHLY BUT I KNEW IT WOULD PROBABLY 
BE A LOT MORE ANYWAY AND THE BUDGET NOW I WOULD SAY IS ABOUT 
WHAT WE'VE SPENT PROBABLY ABOUT FORTY FIVE FIFTY THOUSAND BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE TOTALLY TRANSFORMED IT YEAH 
I CAN'T STOP NOW 
I'VE GOT 
WOW THAT'S A HEFTY FAIR TO PAY FOR THIS JOURNEY 
ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT MORE THAN THEY HAD PLANNED 
THAT TAKES THE TOTAL ON THIS PROJECT TO AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
SO WILL ALL THEIR DESIGN AND HARD WORK PAY OFF OR HAVE THEY DERAILED ANY CHANCE OF MAKING A PROFIT 
TIME FOR TWO PROPERTY INSPECTORS TO SEE IF THIS COTTAGE IS ON TRACK 
THEY HAVE EXTENDED THE PROPERTY TO THE SIDE GONE ONTO THE ATTIC 
THEY'VE MADE THE BEST USE OF 
WHAT WAS THERE CREATING GOOD SIZED LIVING ACCOMMODATION DOWNSTAIRS 
AND MAKING BEST USE OF THE ATTIC TO CREATE AN ADDITIONAL BEDROOM AGAIN IDEAL FOR A FAMILY 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN TO THIS PROPERTY 
FOUR BEDROOMS WELL SIZED AND A LOVELY SIZE GARDEN FOR A FAMILY 
HAVING LOOKED ROUND THE PROPERTY I BELIEVE THE OWNERS HAVE DONE TOO MUCH WORK FOR THE PROPERTY 
AS THERE IS A CEILING PRICE WITHIN THE AREA 
WITH COSTS HEADING TOWARDS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BEFORE FEES AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS THERE'S A RISK 
THAT THEY'VE JUST SPENT TOO MUCH SO WHAT DO THE AGENTS THINK IT COULD BE WORTH ONCE IT'S ALL FINISHED 
I WOULD PUT THIS PROPERTY ON THE MARKET AT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND 
I'D PUT THE PROPERTY ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND POSSIBLY TO ACHIEVE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY OOH I THINK THAT IS A LITTLE BIT LOW 
I THINK WHEN IT'S ALL FINISHED IT'LL BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
UNTIL THE HOUSE IS COMPLETELY FINISHED 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO PUT A PRICE ON IT BUT HAS THE VALUATION CHANGED THEIR MINDS ABOUT THEIR PLANS FOR IT 
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE FAMILY HOME FOR A WHILE 
AND THEN I THINK WE'LL CONSIDER OUR OPTIONS AND POSSIBLY MOVE ONTO A FARM NEXT WITH SOME MORE LAND 
ALTHOUGH YOU COULD ARGUE IT'S COST THEM THE EARTH THEY WILL END UP WITH A LOVELY FAMILY HOME 
WITH ALL THE HISTORY ATTACHED AND ONCE THAT COVENANT HAS EXPIRED A GREAT PLOT OF LAND AS WELL 
SO AS A MOTHER AND SON TEAM ARE THEY PROUD OF WHAT THEY'VE ACHIEVED 
YEAH REALLY PROUD YES I THINK SO YEAH 
HARD WORK BUT YEAH I THINK SO 
AND IT HASN'T PUT US OFF DOING ANOTHER ONE 
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME FOR MORE AUCTION PROPERTY BARGAINS 
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN GOODBYE GOODBYE
