STEAM HOT SPRINGS ROMANS 
WE CAN ONLY BE IN ONE PLACE BATH 
THIS IS WHERE THE STORY OF BATH BEGINS THE FAMOUS HOT SPRINGS 
DEVELOPED BY THE ROMANS WHO FIRST CAME HERE TO TAKE THE CURES SOME TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
AND CONTINUING TO MAKE THE PILGRIMAGE TO BATH IS THIS VERY BRAVE QUEUE 
WHO'VE TURNED OUT IN ALL WEATHERS 
THEY'VE BROUGHT ALONG ALL THEIR ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES 
HOPING TO GET TOP VALUATIONS FROM OUR EXPERTS 
CATHERINE SOUTHON AND JETHRO MARLES 
AND JUST LIKE THE GUY WHOSE FEET ARE TOO BIG FOR HIS BED 
NOTHING SEEMS TO FIT 
THOSE RAINDROPS ARE FALLING ON MY HEAD 
THERE'S A GREAT TURNOUT HERE AT THE BATH PAVILION TODAY 
JETHRO'S ALREADY SPOTTED A LITTLE GEM 
VICKY I AM SO PLEASED WITH THIS LITTLE BOX YOU'VE BROUGHT IN 
BECAUSE RIGHT AWAY IT'S EXCITING ME 
DO YOU KNOW WHY NO TELL ME BECAUSE OF THE MAKER OF THAT BOX 
RIGHT O. K. DO YOU KNOW WHO MADE THAT BOX 
CARTIER YOU SEE YOU KNOW 
IT IS A CARTIER BOX THIS CLASSIC RED LEATHERETTE 
OR LEATHER IN THIS CASE 
WITH A LITTLE GOLD BANDING AROUND THE OUTSIDE 
THAT IS A CARTIER BOX SO LET'S SEE IF IT IS 
THERE ARE COPIES AND FAKES 
THIS LOOKS TO BE PERFECTLY ORIGINAL IT'S GOT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF WEAR 
THERE IN THE TOP IS THE CARTIER STAMP 
WE'RE ONTO A GOOD START AREN'T WE 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT INSIDE 
WE HAVE 
SO TELL ME ABOUT IT 
HOW DID YOU COME BY IT 
IT WAS GIVEN TO MY FATHER 
HE WORKED AT WHAT WAS 
ONE OF THE FIRST NIGHTCLUBS IN LONDON IT WAS THE CABARET CLUB 
THEY WOULD GIVE GIFTS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES FROM TIME TO TIME 
AND YOU KNEW IF YOU WERE IN FAVOUR OR OUT OF FAVOUR BY THE SORT OF GIFT YOU WERE GIVEN 
IF YOU WEREN'T GIVEN A GIFT YOU PARTICULARLY LIKED 
YOU CALLED IT A COFFEE POT WHY DID YOU CALL IT A COFFEE POT 
IT WAS JUST SORT OF A DEROGATORY TERM 
THAT WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF JUST A COFFEE POT 
MY DAD ALWAYS CALLED THIS HIS COFFEE POT 
BECAUSE IT WAS A FEMALE'S CIGARETTE HOLDER 
RIGHT DID HE USE IT 
MY MUM USED IT YEAH NO I THINK IT WAS A BIT TOO FEMININE FOR HIM 
WELL LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE OBJECT ITSELF 
FIRST OF ALL YOU CAN'T IMMEDIATELY NOTICE ANY MARK BY CARTIER 
IT'S IN THE STYLE OF A CARTIER PIECE 
IT'S GOT THE QUALITY OF A PIECE MADE BY CARTIER WITH THESE LOVELY 
LITTLE CABOCHON BLUE SAPPHIRES GOING AROUND THE OUTSIDE 
CABOCHON MEANS POLISHED LIKE A PEBBLE REALLY 
THERE IS A HALLMARK ON THE SIDE HERE 
HAT TELLS ME THAT IT WAS MADE OR ASSAYED IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR 
OH RIGHT 
IF YOU COLLAPSE IT DOWN 
AROUND THE RIM ON THE INSIDE 
NOT ONLY IS THERE A FULL HALLMARK 
BUT ALSO IT SAYS CARTIER LONDON 
RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S CIGARETTES AND BECAUSE IT'S SMOKING 
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT COLLECT THAT SORT OF THING BUT NOT THAT MANY NO 
AND IT'S NOT A POPULAR THING ANY MORE NO 
IT'S GOING OUT OF FASHION 
I THINK IF YOU WERE TO PUT IT IN THE AUCTION I THINK WE NEED TO SAY AN ESTIMATE OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
IT MIGHT SOUND A BIT OF AN ODD ESTIMATE MM HMM 
THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT O. K. 
IT'S SORT OF SUGGESTING TO PEOPLE THAT IT OUGHT TO BE WORTH GETTING ON TO TWO HUNDRED 
BUT YOU CAN BUY IT FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
GET PEOPLE INTERESTED I THINK IF YOU DO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE THE INTEREST 
IF WE PUT IT IN WITH A RESERVE AT ONE HUNDRED FORTY YOU'D BE HAPPY TO PUT IT IN 
YES I WOULD YEAH O. K. WELL LET'S DO THAT O. K. 
JUDY THANKS VERY MUCH FOR COMING ALONG TODAY 
NOW THIS MAY LOOK TO SOME PEOPLE SOME VERY ORDINARY CHINA 
BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING QUITE SPECIAL HERE 
IF WE LOOK VERY CLOSELY 
YEP 
HOW DID YOU ACTUALLY COME TO HAVE THIS 
WELL MY SISTER HAD AN ASSOCIATION WITH A GENTLEMAN THAT SHE MARRIED 
MM HMM THAT HAS SLIGHT CONNECTIONS WITH THE FLEET AIR ARM MUSEUM O. K. 
AND HIS ASSOCIATION WITH IT 
WAS THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST IN THE AREA TO PROMOTE CONCORDE 
RIGHT AND HE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE GIVEN THE WARES 
SO THEY JUST GAVE HIM A FEW BITS AND PIECES 
TO PROMOTE CONCORDE FABULOUS 
YES AND HE LUCKILY KEPT HOLD OF THEM 
HE DID WE HAD A LOT MORE ITEMS THAN THIS 
OBVIOUSLY OVER THE YEARS IT'S GOT BROKEN WE'VE USED IT 
AND UM YES GOT RID OF EVERYTHING 
OH YOU'VE USED IT WE HAVE 
I REMEMBER USING THE SALT AND PEPPER POTS AT WEDDINGS WITHIN THE FAMILY 
OH REALLY ALSO WHEN EVERYONE CAME OVER TO TEA 
YOU USED TO GET THE CUPS AND SAUCERS OUT AND THE SALT AND PEPPER AND 
IN THOSE DAYS YOU DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT 
IT WAS LIKE JUST CROCKERY AND YOU USED IT 
IF IT BROKE YOU JUST REPLACED IT 
ABSOLUTELY WELL CONCORDE MEMORABILIA 
I'M HAVING A LOOK AT THIS REALLY 
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS THE COLLECTIBLE OF THE FUTURE 
THERE WAS AN AUCTION ROOM AN INTERNATIONAL AUCTION ROOM 
THAT HAD A SALE OF CONCORDE MEMORABILIA A FEW YEARS AGO 
AND IT DID MAKE SOME BIG MONEY 
THIS IS POSSIBLY SOME OF THE EARLIER CROCKERY 
SOME OF THE LATER CROCKERY I THINK HAS GOT A BLUE STRIPE 
IF WE LOOK VERY CLOSELY UNDERNEATH 
IT'S GOT THE BRITISH AIRWAYS STAMP AND ROYAL DOULTON AT THE TOP YEP 
WHAT'S NICE ABOUT IT IS WE HAVE THE BRISTOL CONNECTION 
SO HOPEFULLY SELLING IT LOCALLY 
PEOPLE WILL BE INTERESTED FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW 
WHAT I REALLY LOVE ABOUT IT IS THE SALT AND PEPPER IT'S SO DINKY 
ACTUALLY YOU'VE GOT SOME SALT IN THERE TOO WONDERFUL 
NOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT A VALUE ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE A GUESSTIMATE NOT AN ESTIMATE 
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SOLD ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE 
WITH THAT IN MIND WE'VE GOT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE BOWLS 
ONE PLATE AND THE SALT AND PEPPER WHICH ARE SO CUTE 
THEY ARE VERY DAINTY SO CUTE I'M GOING TO PUT ABOUT FORTY TO SIXTY ON 
AND LET'S HOPE IT TAKES OFF 
CHRIS TWO THINGS ATTRACTED ME TO THE TABLE 
YOUR HAT AND THIS SCANDINAVIAN GLASS 
I KNOW IT'S SCANDINAVIAN IT'S EITHER SWEDISH OR DANISH 
SWEDISH SWEDISH IS IT 
SWEDISH SWEDISH IS IT 
DO YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT A LITTLE 
GO ON TELL ME STROMBERG 
YEAH LATE SIXTIES 
HE WAS A STUDIO ARTIST WHO I THINK WENT TO KOSTA BODA AND WORKED FOR THEM FOR A WHILE 
YES HE DID FOR A LITTLE BIT YEAH 
EDWARD STROMBERG AND HE WORKED WITH HIS SON ASTOR 
THE FACTORY HAD BEEN GOING SINCE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX IT WAS CALLED LINDFORS 
STROMBERG TOOK IT OVER IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE 
SO IT HAS GOOD PEDIGREE IT'S STILL GOING TODAY 
IT'S GOT A DIFFERENT NAME AGAIN 
IT KEEPS CHANGING AND IT KEEPS EVOLVING 
THIS IS THE PERIOD THAT EVERYBODY WANTS RIGHT NOW EARLY SIXTIES 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY STUNNING HOW DID YOU COME BY IT 
I WAS AT AUCTION FOR SOME JAPANESE PIECES TWO OPIUM PIPES 
THIS CAME IN A BOX THAT I HADN'T EVEN LOOKED IN AS PART OF THE LOT 
AND THIS GENERALLY ISN'T THE KIND OF KIT THAT YOU'RE INTO THEN IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR OPIUM PIPES 
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT BUT THIS WAS OVER A YEAR AGO 
I'VE LIVED WITH IT AND WE'VE HAD A BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP AH 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY STUNNING LET ME JUST HAVE A LOOK 
IT SHOULD BE SIGNED UNDERNEATH WITH A SCRATCHED DETAIL 
THERE IT IS I CAN JUST SEE THAT 
CONDITION IN GLASS IS SO IMPORTANT 
GLASS IS VERY HARD TO SELL TO THE PURIST UNLESS IT'S IN ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CONDITION 
THEY DON'T LIKE LITTLE SCRATCHES 
THERE IS ONE LITTLE TINY SCRATCH ON HERE AND IT IS JUST THERE I SEE IT 
IT'S NOT THAT DEEP I THINK THAT ONE WILL COME OUT IT WILL 
THE TRICK IS WHEN YOU'RE BUYING GLASS FROM A CAR BOOT SALE OR AN OUTDOOR FAIR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
NEVER BUY GLASS THAT'S BEING SOLD IN THE RAIN BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER TELL IF THE PIECE IS SCRATCHED 
ONCE IT'S DAMP OR WET YOU DON'T SEE ANY SCRATCHES 
SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL 
O. K. I THINK THIS 
IF WE PUT IT INTO AUCTION 
WILL SELL FOR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE HUNDRED FORTY QUITE EASILY 
IT IS A FASHION STATEMENT THIS IS WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS RIGHT NOW 
SOUNDS VERY GOOD TO ME WHAT DID YOU PAY FOR IT 
WELL I DIDN'T YOU DIDN'T IT WAS A FREEBIE IN YOUR JOB LOT 
EXACTLY WHAT DID THE JOB LOT COST 
THIRTY WELL I THINK 
THIS WILL DO VERY VERY WELL IN A SALE ROOM 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE WHAT HAVE YOU BROUGHT ALONG 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST A WOODEN PANEL 
THAT'S BEEN INLAID WITH MOTHER OF PEARL AND PAINTED 
O. K. SO YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT IT IS 
HOW DID YOU COME BY IT WHERE HAS IT BEEN 
MY FATHER BOUGHT IT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY YEARS AGO 
HOPEFULLY I THINK HE INTENDED IT TO GO ON HIS NARROW BOAT 
I DON'T EVER REMEMBER SEEING IT ON THE BOAT SO I THINK 
IT JUST GOT PUT UP IN THE ATTIC AND IT'S BEEN THAT EVER SINCE 
SO HE BOUGHT IT AT AN ANTIQUE SHOP OR SOMETHING 
I THINK HE DID YES UP IN THE WEST MIDLANDS WHERE HE LIVED 
HOW LONG AGO WAS THAT THEN 
IT WOULD BE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
DO YOU KNOW HOW ALL THIS PANEL IS NO DO YOU 
I HOPE I MIGHT KNOW 
IT IS A PANEL IN FACT 
IF YOU LOOK ON THE SIDE JUST HERE ON YOUR SIDE 
THERE ARE SPACES WHERE HINGES HAVE BEEN PUT 
YES SO OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS BEEN HUNG AS A DOOR 
THERE'S ALSO SOME WORK GONE ON UNDERNEATH HERE ALONG THE BASE WHERE IT'S BEEN CHIPPED AWAY 
SO MAYBE IT DID SLOT IN 
AND WAS PART OF SOME QUITE GRAND PIECE OF FURNITURE 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE SPECTACULAR 
NOW YOU KNOW THAT IT'S TWENTY YEARS OLD 
YOU THINK IT'S OLDER THAN THAT 
TWENTY TO THIRTY EXACTLY 
IT'S PROBABLY NEARER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY YEARS OLD 
GOOD GRACIOUS 
SO IT'S BEEN AROUND QUITE A LONG TIME 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S MADE OF IT'S INLAID WITH MOTHER OF PEARL 
I THOUGHT IT WAS WOOD BUT I'VE SINCE BEEN TOLD IT'S PAPIER MACHE 
EXACTLY RIGHT 
IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE PART OF A CABINET IT'S BEEN MADE OF WOOD 
ON EITHER SIDE IT'S BEEN SANDWICHED BUT WITH PAPIER MACHE 
WE ALL KNOW WHAT PAPIER MACHE IS 
IT CAN BE MOULDED INTO THE SHAPE 
THE GREAT THING IS YOU CAN DECORATE IT AND OVER DECORATE IT 
AS YOU'VE QUITE RIGHTLY SAID YOU'VE GOT THE MOTHER OF PEARL INLAY 
UP HERE AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE PAINTING DETAIL WHICH IS LOVELY 
WHEN YOU LOOK ON THE TOP LOOK AT THIS LOVELY FARMLAND SCENE HERE 
WITH THE FARM BUILDINGS AND THE LOVELY MILL STREAM COMING DOWN 
IT'S AN IDYLLIC SCENE ISN'T IT YES 
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED LOVELY ON YOUR FATHER'S NARROW BOAT 
IT'S A SHAME YOU DIDN'T GET ROUND TO IT 
YOU'VE GOT A CENTRAL PANEL HERE 
WITH THIS MOTHER OF PEARL FRAME AROUND THE CENTRAL MOTHER OF PEARL 
DOWN HERE THIS LITTLE CHAP HERE THIS LITTLE DOG 
A PERSONAL TOUCH MAYBE THE FAMILY DOG 
YES WHO KNOWS VERY SWEET THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT DAMAGE ON HERE 
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BIT CLOSE TO A FIRE A WARM FIRE AT SOME TIME 
NOW THIS PIECE ITSELF HAS COME OFF SOME 
PROBABLY A GRAND PIECE OF FURNITURE I WOULD GUESS 
PERHAPS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY IT'S DIFFICULT TO DATE THIS SORT OF THING 
BUT PAPIER MACHE TYPES OF OBJECTS 
THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE IN THEIR HEY DAY REALLY 
AS FAR AS VALUE IS CONCERNED WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH 
I THOUGHT ABOUT FORTY TO SIXTY 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE GIVING IT AWAY A LITTLE BIT YES 
I THINK WE OUGHT TO SAY SIXTY TO EIGHTY 
EVEN BETTER I THINK IF IT WAS MINE I WOULDN'T WANT TO SELL IT FOR ANY LESS THAN THAT RIGHT 
AND WE'LL PUT IT IN THE AUCTION WITH A RESERVE AT SIXTY HOW DO YOU FEEL LOVELY

WELL NOT BAD FOR STARTERS 
AFTER ALL THAT EXCITEMENT AT THE AUCTION I NEED A REFRESHING DRINK 
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN A COOL GLASS OF WATER 
AT THE HEART OF THIS BEAUTIFUL GEORGIAN CITY OF BATH 
AND VERY MUCH CENTRAL TO ITS EXISTENCE IS A NATURAL PHENOMENON 
IT'S UNIQUE IN ALL OF BRITAIN 
PIPING HOT SPRINGS 
WITH THE STEAMING WATER BUBBLING UP 
STAINING EVERYTHING AROUND IT A VIVID RED 
THE SPRINGS WERE A SOURCE OF MYSTERY AND WONDER FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
UNABLE TO EXPLAIN IT THEY WERE CONSIDERED THE WORK OF THE GODS 
BUT WHEN THE ROMANS FIRST CONQUERED BRITAIN IN THE FIRST CENTURY AD 
THIS SACRED SITE SUDDENLY LAY AT THE HEART OF A ROMAN TOWN 
RECOGNISING THE CURATIVE AND SACRED POWERS OF THE HOT SPRINGS 
WORK SOON BEGAN ON THE LUXURIOUS ROMAN SPA AQUAE SULIS 
ONE OF THE MANY ARCHAEOLOGISTS DRAWN TO THIS SACRED SITE IS MAREK LEWCUN 
THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO SPEAK TO US THAT'S A PLEASURE 
YOU CAN SEE WE'RE AT THE HEART OF THE COMPLEX HERE 
THERE'S HOT BUBBLES BUBBLING UP IN THE WATER THERE HOW IS THAT CREATED 
THAT WATER FELL ON THE MENDIP HILLS JUST SOUTH OF HERE TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
AND IT PERCOLATES DOWN TO A DEPTH OF TWO TO THREE KILOMETRES 
AND THERE THE ROCKS HEAT IT UP 
THEN THE WATER COMES UP HERE IN THE HEART OF BATH 
SO THAT FELL TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO AS RAINWATER FALLING ON OUR ANCESTORS 
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN STONE AGE MAN 
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
HOW MUCH WATER ACTUALLY FLOWS 
A QUARTER OF A MILLION GALLONS A DAY GOSH THAT IS A LOT 
POINT OUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT IS ACTUALLY ROMAN 
BELOW THE WATERLINE YOU'VE GOT A STONE BUILT RESERVOIR 
ORIGINALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LINED WITH LEAD 
THERE ARE STATUE BASES IN THERE AS WELL 
YES ABOVE THE WATERLINE WE'VE GOT THE WINDOW HERE 
THE LOVELY SMILING WINDOWS YES THOSE ARE ROMAN 
WHAT DID THE ROMANS USE THIS FOR INITIALLY 
THIS WAS THE SACRED HEART OF THE WHOLE COMPLEX 
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE COME HERE THEY WOULD HAVE PRAYED TO THE GODDESS 
THEY WOULD HAVE MADE OFFERINGS 
THEY ALSO WOULD HAVE THROWN IN CURSES AS WELL 
PRAYERS MIGHT BE A MORE CORRECT WAY OF PUTTING IT 
LITTLE PIECES OF ROLLED UP LEAD 
AND ON THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SCRIBED INTO IT 
PERHAPS SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TAKEN SOMETHING FROM THEM OR STOLEN IT 
AND THEY WOULD HAVE SAID TO THE GOD 
MAKE THIS PERSON HAVE NO CHILDREN OR BRING BAD HEALTH UPON THEM 
WE'VE GOT A COLLECTION OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY CURSES WHICH PEOPLE THREW IN HERE 
AND ALSO THOUSANDS OF COINS TOO 
MANY THOUSANDS 
THERE ARE LATER STAGES OF ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT 
GOING ON HERE THROUGH THE PERIOD CAN YOU POINT OUT SOME OF THEM 
JUST ABOVE THE WATERLINE BEHIND US 
WE'VE GOT NICHES WHICH ARE NORMAN THAT IS MEDIEVAL IN DATE 
AS YOU GO UP YOU'VE GOT THIS DECORATIVE STONEWORK SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU HAVE THE LEGENDARY FOUNDER OF BATH BLADUD 
I WAS GONNA SAY WHO IS THAT CHARACTER 
HE'S KING BLADUD AND IN EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY THREE B. C. HE WAS CURED OF LEPROSY WHAT HERE 
THAT'S RIGHT HERE IN BATH WOW 
ABOVE THAT YOU GO INTO THE GEORGIAN PERIOD THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
ABOVE THAT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ADDITIONS AT THE VERY TOP 
THOSE BIG SASH WINDOWS YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT 
THAT'S RIGHT IT IS TWO THOUSAND YEARS' WORTH YES 
BEHIND ME IS THE GREAT BATH THE CENTREPIECE WE ALL RECOGNISE 
IT REALLY DOES GO TO SHOW WHAT MASTER BUILDERS THE ROMANS WERE 
HOW SIGNIFICANT WAS THIS AS AN ACHIEVEMENT FOR A DESIGN AND BUILD SCHEME IT'S QUITE INCREDIBLE REALLY 
THIS IS A BIG SPACE AND IT HAD A HUGE BARREL VAULTED ROOF OVER THE TOP OF IT 
WITH THESE GREAT COLUMNS SUPPORTING THAT 
YOU HAD ALL THE WATER WHICH THEY'D ALREADY HARNESSED FLOWING IN 
THEY ALSO HAD LEAD PIPES WHICH WERE TAKING WATER INTO OTHER BATHS TOO 
YOU HAD THE WEST BATHS THE EAST BATHS 
IT'S A HUGE COMPLEX WHICH DEVELOPED OVER TIME IT WENT THROUGH MANY PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT 
THIS WAS ALWAYS THE HEART THE GREAT BATH IN FRONT OF US 
THAT'S INCREDIBLE THE PLUMBING SYSTEM THAT THEY PUT IN THEN 
THAT'S RIGHT WE COULDN'T REPRODUCE THIS TODAY IF WE TRIED NO 
SO WAS IT AN IMPORTANT PART OF ROMAN CULTURE TO TAKE A BATH HERE 
IT WAS IT WAS A SOCIAL CENTRE THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE HUNG OUT 
THIS IS WHERE THEY RELAXED 
PEOPLE WOULD ALSO HAVE CARRIED OUT BUSINESS DEALS HERE AS WELL 
SO IT'S A BIT LIKE GOING DOWN THE PUB SORT OF WHEELING AND DEALING 
THAT'S RIGHT YES THAT SORT OF PLACE 
ANOTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO THIS SITE WOULD BE THE TEMPLE 
WE'RE STANDING IN IT RIGHT NOW 
YOU'VE GOT TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN OPEN COURTYARD 
IT WOULDN'T HAVE THIS DARK CEILING WOULD IT MAREK NO 
SO WHAT WENT ON HERE 
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD THE TEMPLE OF MINERVA HERE JUST BEHIND US 
AND THAT'S HER UP THERE 
THAT'S HER SHE WAS DISCOVERED IN A DRAIN IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN 
AT THAT TIME NOBODY REALLY KNEW MUCH ABOUT ROMAN BATH 
NOW WE'VE GOT THE TEMPLE THERE 
WE'VE ONLY GOT THE STEPS THERE'S STILL AN AWFUL LOT TO BE DISCOVERED 
WHAT WE HAVE GOT IS THE PEDIMENT WHICH HAD THE GORGON'S HEAD AT THE VERY CENTRE 
IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE BEST ROMAN TEMPLE PEDIMENTS 
IN THE WHOLE OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE SO IT'S QUITE AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY 
WE'VE STILL GOT THAT 
HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS SITE TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF ROMAN BRITAIN 
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE FEW PLACES 
WHERE YOU'VE GOT QUITE A LOT SURVIVING PARTICULARLY WELL INDEED 
BUT ALSO AS A WHOLE COMPLEX 
YOU'VE GOT THE BATHING ESTABLISHMENT 
YOU'VE GOT THE TEMPLE COURTYARD 
THE TEMPLE ITSELF WE HAVE MORE TO DISCOVER A LOT IS STILL BURIED 
THE COURTYARD GOES BEYOND WHERE I'M STANDING HERE AS WELL THIS IS JUST A SMALL AREA OF IT 
AND I KNOW THIS SITE IS VERY SACRED TO YOU AS WELL 
ESPECIALLY THAT LITTLE GULLY THERE 
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S WHERE MY CAREER BEGAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
I'D ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN ARCHAEOLOGY SINCE I WAS A KID 
AND AN OPPORTUNITY AROSE FOR SOMEBODY TO WORK HERE 
AND I JUMPED AT THE OPPORTUNITY THE REST IS HISTORY 
HOW WONDERFUL YES 
THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE FIFTH CENTURY 
ALSO MEANT THE END TO THESE MAGNIFICENT BATHS 
AND THE ROMANS' SOPHISTICATED DRAINING SYSTEM 
EVENTUALLY BROKE DOWN FLOODING THE WHOLE AREA 
ALL OF THIS WAS COVERED IN AN OOZING BLACK MUD 
WE'RE BACK AT THE VALUATION DAY NOW 
AND CATHERINE'S DISCOVERED A SPLENDID LITTLE HEIRLOOM 
PHILIPPA THANK YOU FOR COMING ALONG TO FLOG IT TODAY 
YOU'VE BROUGHT ALONG THIS RATHER CHARMING AND RUSTIC 
OIL ON BOARD BY A SNAPE 
WILLIAM H. SNAPE WHERE DID YOU GET THIS FROM 
IT WAS FROM MY MOTHER 
SHE HAD IT ABOVE HER PIANO AND THERE WAS A PAIR 
WHEN SHE DIED WE DIVIDED THE PICTURES OUT IN LOTS 
AND THIS WAS MY LOT 
AH SO WHERE'S THE OTHER 
IN NEW ZEALAND IT'S GONE ACROSS THE SEAS TO NEW ZEALAND 
TO FAMILY IN NEW ZEALAND YES MY SISTER RIGHT 
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE OTHER ONE IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL SCENE 
IT WAS A SIMILAR SCENE IN TERMS OF IT WAS A FIRESIDE 
AND IT WAS AN OLD WOMAN SLIGHTLY LONGER AND MORE DETAILED 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY NICE TO HAVE THE PAIR 
BUT WE'VE JUST GOT THE ONE 
IT'S IN NEW ZEALAND I'M AFRAID A LONG WAY TO GO BACK AND RETRIEVE IT 
NEVERTHELESS WE HAVE GOT QUITE AN INTERESTING PICTURE HERE 
IT IS QUITE SOLEMN I'M TEMPTED TO FEEL QUITE SORRY FOR THIS CHAP 
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S BEEN OUT IN THE FIELDS ALL DAY 
HE'S COME BACK AND IS JUST HAVING A LITTLE WARM BY THE FIRE 
LET'S JUST TALK A BIT ABOUT THE ARTIST 
HE WAS WORKING AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY QUITE A LONG TIME AGO 
YES I'D PROBABLY DATE THIS TO ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THE ARTIST TENDED TO PAINT QUITE A LOT OF RURAL SCENES 
AND A LOT OF THESE RUSTIC PICTURES THE SORT OF THING WE'VE GOT HERE 
VALUE WISE I'D PROBABLY THINK THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH 
IF YOU DID HAVE THE OTHER ONE IT WOULD BE GREAT 
IT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE 
IT'D PROBABLY BE WORTH ABOUT SIX HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED 
BUT ON ITS OWN LIKE THIS I THINK YOU'D BE LOOKING AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
HOW DOES THAT SOUND TO YOU THAT SOUNDS FINE 
IT'S GREAT BECAUSE IT IS ON BOARD IT IS OIL ON PANEL 
IT HAS GOT WONDERFUL CHARM 
IT IS QUITE IT'S NOT TO EVERYONE'S TASTE 
NO INCLUDING ME 
FAIR ENOUGH IT IS QUITE A SAD PICTURE 
WHAT ABOUT ITS PAIR OVER IN NEW ZEALAND 
IS THAT STILL WITH THE FAMILY 
YES I WAS THINKING OF PUTTING THE MONEY TO GO ON A TRIP 
OBVIOUSLY IT WON'T PAY FOR THE WHOLE THING 
BUT IT'LL PAY FOR SOME OF IT WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA 
YOU COULD PUT THE MONEY TOWARDS GOING TO SEE ITS PAIR 
TAKE SOME GOOD PHOTOGRAPHS OF IT BEFORE YOU GO 
SO YOU CAN REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE YES 
NOW ERIC YOU BOUGHT THIS JUG THIS EWER THIS POT 
OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT IN FOR ME TO HAVE A LOOK AT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK WHEN YOU SEE THIS HOW OLD DO YOU THINK IT IS 
I THINK IT'S ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTIES THIRTIES WHY DO YOU THINK THAT 
IT'S GOT AN ART NOUVEAU TYPE LOOK TO IT THE PATTERN ON IT 
HOW DID YOU COME BY IT 
I BOUGHT IT IN AN ANTIQUE SHOP 
IN A BOX OF COPPER BITS AND PIECES 
I FOUND THAT ATTRACTIVE AS A PIECE OF ART NOUVEAU 
I PICKED IT OUT OF THE BOX 
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR IT I PAID A FIVER FOR THAT 
A WHOLE FIVER YES 
SO YOU OBVIOUSLY WERE ATTRACTED TO IT FOR THOSE REASONS 
AND NOW YOU'RE THINKING OF SELLING IT WHY YES 
WELL THE MONEY I COULD DO WITH TO GET A COMPUTER 
WELL I TELL YOU WHAT I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE QUID NOW IF YOU LIKE 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR MONEY BACK 
NO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH MORE THAN FIVE QUID YES RIGHT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS JUG WAS USED FOR 
I THINK IT'S A COFFEE POT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT 
WHEN I GOT IT UNDERNEATH IT WAS ALL BURNT 
ALL BLACK ON THE BOTTOM AND I THOUGHT IT'S GOT TO BE A COFFEE POT 
COS SOMEONE'S HAD IT OVER A BURNER YES O. K. 
ANY JUG OR ANY UTENSIL THAT'S DESIGNED TO HOLD A HOT LIQUID 
WILL INVARIABLY HAVE AN INSULATED HANDLE 
TO STOP HEAT GOING INTO THE HANDLE 
THIS HASN'T GOT ANY INSULATION IN HERE 
SO YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF BONE OR IVORY 
INSERTED INTO THE HANDLE TO STOP THE HEAT TRANSMITTING INTO THE HANDLE 
SO IT CAN'T HAVE BEEN 
IT WON'T HAVE BEEN FOR THAT THIS WILL BE FOR SOFT DRINKS 
FOR WINE OR FOR WATER 
NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS INSTANTLY I THINK OF ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT WITH THE ART NOUVEAU THEME 
AND I'M ALSO HOPING THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE BY WMF 
WUERTTEMBERGISCHE METALLWAREN FABRIKEN I'VE PRACTISED THAT 
S. A M. O. LTH F. L. L. 
IT'S A MOUTHFUL IF WE TURN IT UP AND HAVE A LOOK UNDERNEATH THE BASE 
THERE IS A MARK HERE 
BEFORE WMF USED THE STAMP WMF THEY USED AN OSTRICH 
SO THIS IS SLIGHTLY EARLIER THAN I THOUGHT 
IT IS PROBABLY LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THAT IS IN ITS FAVOUR 
THE ONLY THING THAT I AM REALLY UNHAPPY ABOUT 
IS THIS FINIAL UP HERE 
THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT RIGHT 
I ADDED THAT AT A LATER STAGE 
IT DID GET KNOCKED OFF AND THE GUY THAT I BOUGHT IT FROM 
HE COULDN'T FIND THE TOP OF IT SO I PUT THAT ON 
ORIGINALLY I THINK IT WOULD HAVE HAD A FINIAL 
THAT WAS MORE OF A CROSS SHAPE MAYBE 
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY USED TO HAVE 
SO THIS SORT OF WORKS BUT IT'S NOT VERY PRACTICAL 
THAT'S A STUD TO GO OVER A SCREW ISN'T IT YES YES I KNEW THAT 
YOU WEREN'T GOING TO TELL ME A BIT CHEEKY 
THE OTHER THING IS THE DAMAGE THE DENTING AROUND THE BASE HERE 
A LITTLE DENTING THAT IS NOT A REAL PROBLEM 
BECAUSE THAT CAN BE DEALT WITH AND SORTED OUT 
SO YOU PAID FIVE 
YOU'VE ADDED AT LEAST ONE IN VALUE BY ADDING THAT FINIAL 
I THINK IF WE TAKE IT OFF AND PUT ANOTHER ONE ON 
WE MIGHT INCREASE THE VALUE 
AS IT IS I THINK AN ESTIMATE OF THIRTY TO FIFTY 
O. K. I THINK THAT IS A FAIR ESTIMATE 
THERE'S WMF THIRTY RESERVE DO YOU WANT TO PUT IT IN THE AUCTION 
YES SURE 
SHEILA I LOVE FRENCH PRISONER OF WAR WORK 
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL MODEL THAT YOU'VE BROUGHT ALONG TODAY 
WHERE DID YOU GET HOLD OF IT 
IT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR QUITE SOME TIME 
IT BELONGED TO MY MOTHER'S FAMILY 
HER FATHER APPARENTLY WAS A MARINER 
WHETHER HE ACTUALLY HAD IT PURCHASED AND MADE I DON'T KNOW 
THE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE RIGGING 
WAS MADE FROM SOME LADY'S HAIR 
ORIGINALLY THERE WAS SOME LETTER 
REGARDING THE ACTUAL BUILDING OF IT AND THE MAKING OF IT 
BUT THAT HAS GOT LOST 
SO YOU HAD A LETTER THAT GAVE YOU ALL THIS INFORMATION 
I DIDN'T BUT THE FAMILY DID 
RIGHT AND IT'S BEEN IN MY MOTHER'S CUPBOARD FOR YEARS AND YEARS 
THE ACTUAL SITE WHERE IT WAS MADE APPARENTLY WAS IN FISHPONDS 
WHICH WAS WHERE THE FRENCH PRISONERS OF WAR WERE INTERNED ABSOLUTELY 
SO IT WAS MADE AND THE BUILDING IS STILL THERE NOW 
I THINK THE DATE ON IT WAS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY TWO 
WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS FRENCH PRISONER OF WAR WORK IS THE DETAIL 
AND THE DETAIL IS INCREDIBLE 
IF YOU LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT THE HULL 
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE INDIVIDUAL PLANKS 
THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN PINNED TOGETHER 
IT'S AMAZING IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE WAY THESE PEOPLE WERE WORKING 
THESE PRISONERS THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY WERE IN 
AND THE DETAIL THAT THEY GO TO ON THESE MODELS IT IS INCREDIBLE 
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE LITTLE FLAPS 
WITH ALL THE CANNONS JUST PEEPING THROUGH 
AT THE FRONT WE HAVE A LOVELY FIGUREHEAD 
WHICH HAS BEEN CARVED A WARRIOR FIGUREHEAD 
AND AT THE BACK THE BEAUTIFUL GALLERIED STERN 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT AS WELL IS IT'S IN THIS LOVELY DISPLAY CASE 
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THESE MODELS OVER THE YEARS IN BOXWOOD AND IN BONE 
OFTEN THEY'RE OUT OF THEIR CASE 
BUT THIS IS LOVELY BECAUSE IT'S IN ITS ORIGINAL DISPLAY CASE 
THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THE RIGGING 
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU'LL FIND WITH MANY MODELS 
THE RIGGING DOES DETERIORATE 
AND AS THESE PIECES ARE MOVED FROM ONE DISPLAY CABINET TO THE NEXT 
THEY ARE GOING TO GET DAMAGED 
YOU CAN ONLY EXPECT THAT FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTIES TO NOW 
FOR SOMEBODY TO DO THIS IT WOULD COST AN AWFUL LOT 
TO GET IT REPAIRED AND TO GET IT DONE PROPERLY 
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA ON HOW MUCH IT WOULD BE WORTH AT AUCTION 
I WOULD HAVE NO IDEA AT ALL 
NOT AT ALL 
IF I SAID IT WOULD BE WORTH ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED HOW DOES THAT SOUND 
YOU WOULD LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE 
PROBABLY YES PROBABLY 
I CAN PUT IT IN AT SIX HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED 
BECAUSE I KNOW IT IS VERY DEAR TO YOU 
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST LET IT GO 
I'LL PUT IT IN AT SIX HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED PROTECT IT WITH A SIX HUNDRED RESERVE 
AND LET'S HOPE THAT IT MAKES A LOT OF MONEY YEAH 
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE PIECE OF LOCAL HISTORY SHEILA'S MODEL SHIP IS 
AND WORTH EVERY PENNY OF CATHERINE'S VALUATION 
JOINING IT IN THE SALE ROOM IS PHILIPPA'S OIL PAINTING 
AND ERIC'S COPPER JUG 
LET'S HOPE HIS HANDIWORK ON THE LID DOESN'T DETER THE PURISTS 
LET'S SEE WHAT AUCTIONEER MARC BURRIDGE THINKS OF SHEILA'S MODEL SHIP 
CRACKING LITTLE LOT THIS IT REALLY IS 
THIS ONE'S SOMETHING FOR THE PURISTS IT BELONGS TO SHEILA 
IT'S A MODEL OF A SHIP IN A CASE OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN SEE THAT 
IT WAS MADE BY A PRISONER OF WAR JUST OUTSIDE BRISTOL 
APPARENTLY SOME OF THE RIGGING IS MADE OF HUMAN HAIR 
CATHERINE OUR EXPERT HAS PUT SIX HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED ON THIS 
YES IT'S NICELY MADE 
IT'S FINELY DETAILED FOR THE SCALE 
CATHERINE SAID AGE WISE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTIES ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTIES DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLY A BIT EARLIER 
BECAUSE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTEEN WAS THE END OF THE NAPOLEONIC WARS 
THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO 
HE MAY HAVE STAYED ON IN ENGLAND AND CARRIED ON MAKING THIS 
BUT I THINK THE CHAP WHO MADE THIS 
OBVIOUSLY KNEW WHAT A SHIP SHOULD LOOK LIKE OF THAT PERIOD 
AND IT'S A VERY GOOD MODEL 
SO REALLY THAT SHOULD PUT THE VALUE UP 
IF THE PIECE IS SLIGHTLY EARLIER 
WELL IT'S A DIFFICULT ITEM TO VALUE 
IT IS ISN'T IT HOW WOULD YOU VALUE IT 
I'VE HAD INTEREST AND I HOPE FINGERS CROSSED 
THAT WE'LL GET TO THE RESERVE 
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS SOMEWHERE IN THE SIX HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED IS SPOT ON 
I HOPE SO WITH A FAVOURABLE WIND WE'LL WIN WE COULD COULDN'T WE 
WELL GOOD NEWS ON THE SHIP 
BUT FIRST UP IT'S PHILIPPA'S OIL PAINTING 
WE HAVE A CRACKING LITTLE OIL ON BOARD NOW 
IT'S GOING UNDER THE HAMMER IT BELONGS TO PHILIPPA NOT FOR MUCH LONGER 
WE NEED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
I HOPE IT GETS A LOT MORE THAN THAT 
BECAUSE PHILIPPA IS PUTTING THE MONEY TOWARDS A TRIP TO NEW ZEALAND 
HAVE YOU BEEN THERE BEFORE YES I HAVE 
OBVIOUSLY FELL IN LOVE WITH IT 
I LOVED IT IT WAS BEAUTIFUL A REALLY BEAUTIFUL PLACE 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO EMIGRATE THERE 
OH NO NO I LOVE LIVING IN ENGLAND 
BUT MY SISTER LIVES IN NEW ZEALAND YOU SEE SO I'M GOING TO VISIT HER
