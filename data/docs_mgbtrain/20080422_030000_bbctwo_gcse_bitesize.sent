HELLO AND WELCOME TO GCSE BITESIZE 
THIS PROGRAMME ON MODERN BRITISH HISTORY FOCUSES ON THE SKILLS YOU NEED TO DO WELL IN YOUR EXAM 
THE TWO OTHER PROGRAMMES ON HISTORY ARE 
THE BEST WAY TO STUDY WITH BITESIZE IS 
WORKING THROUGH THE VIDEO IN BITESIZE CHUNKS 
EACH PROGRAMME IS FULL OF USEFUL INFORMATION 
THIS PROGRAMME ON MODERN BRITISH HISTORY WILL LOOK AT 
IN THIS SECTION ON THE LIBERAL REFORMS WE'LL LOOK AT 
WATCH THE CLIP THEN PAUSE THE TAPE 
AND MAKE NOTES OF THE DIFFICULTIES PEOPLE IN BRITAIN FACED IN NINETEEN HUNDRED 
OVER THREE QUARTERS OF THE POPULATION WERE WORKING CLASS 
AND A THIRD OF THESE LIVED IN DESPERATE POVERTY 
POVERTY AND SQUALOR WERE MOST OBVIOUS IN THE TOWNS AND CITIES 
THEY WERE SWAMPED BY HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE LOOKING FOR JOBS CREATED BY THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
OVERCROWDED HOUSING WAS ONE MAIN THING WHICH MADE FOR THE DISMAL LIFESTYLE OF THE LABOURING CLASSES 
MOST HOUSES DIDN'T HAVE TOILETS OR RUNNING WATER WITH SUCH LIVING CONDITIONS IT'S NO SURPRISE 
THERE WERE FREQUENT OUTBREAKS OF DISEASES LIKE TYPHOID AND TUBERCULOSIS 
LIFE EXPECTANCY WAS SHORT AND THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF CHILDHOOD DEATHS 
IN SCOTLAND IN NINETEEN HUNDRED THIRTEEN OUT OF EVERY ONE HUNDRED BABIES DIED BEFORE THEY WERE ONE YEAR OLD 
THERE THEY DIE 
AND THEIR LITTLE BODIES ARE LAID ON A TABLE OR DRESSER TO BE OUT OF THE WAY OF THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS 
WHO PLAY AND SLEEP AND EAT IN THEIR GHASTLY COMPANY 
FROM BEGINNING TO RAPID ENDING THE LIVES OF THESE CHILDREN ARE SHORT PARTS IN A CONTINUOUS TRAGEDY 
A LARGE PROPORTION ENTER LIFE BY THE SIDE DOOR OF ILLEGITIMACY 
ONE IN EVERY FIVE OF ALL WHO ARE BORN THERE NEVER SEE THE END OF THEIR FIRST YEAR 
OF THOSE WHO SO PREMATURELY DIE 
A THIRD HAVE NEVER BEEN SEEN IN THEIR SICKNESS 
MOST POLITICIANS AT THIS TIME DIDN'T SEE IT AS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT 
TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM POVERTY AND HARDSHIP 
THEY BELIEVED IN SELF HELP NOT STATE HELP IT WAS UP TO INDIVIDUALS TO LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES 
NINETEENTH CENTURY GOVERNMENTS ALLOWED ONE EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF SELF HELP THE POOR LAW 
PEOPLE WHO WERE JOBLESS PENNILESS AND WITH NO MEANS OF SUPPORT 
COULD BE CLASSIFIED AS PAUPERS AND APPLY FOR RELIEF UNDER THE POOR LAW 
NOW PAUSE THE TAPE AND COMPLETE YOUR NOTES 
HOW DID YOU DO YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED THAT 
IN MANY CITIES PEOPLE LIVED IN OVERCROWDED HOUSES WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY IN ONE ROOM 
MANY FAMILIES SHARED ONE TOILET AND HAD TO QUEUE UP AT A TAP FOR FRESH WATER 
IN CONDITIONS LIKE THESE EPIDEMICS WERE COMMON ALTHOUGH CHOLERA WAS NO LONGER WIDESPREAD 
THE DAMP OVERCROWDED HOUSES OFTEN LED TO TUBERCULOSIS OR WHITE DEATH AS IT WAS CALLED THEN 
VICTIMS DIED IN AGONY AS THEIR LUNGS DISSOLVED INTO WHITE FOAM 
DISEASE LED TO HIGH INFANT MORTALITY ONE CHILD IN FIVE DIED BEFORE THE AGE OF TWO 
AND FAMILIES HAD HARDLY ANY WAYS OF GETTING HELP 
MOST DOCTORS ONLY SAW PATIENTS WHO COULD AFFORD TO PAY FOR TREATMENT 
AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE RECEIVING OUTDOOR RELIEF 
WITH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN WORKHOUSES WHERE THEY COULD BE TREATED VERY BADLY 
FAMILIES WERE SPLIT UP 
PAUPERS HAD TO WEAR A UNIFORM AND THERE WERE STRICT RULES 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON WHAT BRITAIN WAS LIKE IN NINETEEN HUNDRED 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP 
THEN PAUSE THE TAPE AND MAKE NOTES ON WHY THE LIBERALS BEGAN A PROGRAMME OF REFORMS IN NINETEEN OH SIX 
AS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WENT ON MORE PEOPLE OF POWER AND INFLUENCE 
REALISED A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF POVERTY WAS NEEDED 
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS CAUSED THIS CHANGE IN ATTITUDE 
WHEN SOLDIERS WERE BEING RECRUITED FOR THE BOER WAR ALMOST HALF THE VOLUNTEERS HAD TO BE REJECTED 
BECAUSE OF THEIR POOR PHYSICAL CONDITION THIS LED TO FEARS FOR BRITAIN'S NATIONAL EFFICIENCY 
THERE WOULDN'T BE A STRONG ARMY OR NAVY TO DEFEND BRITAIN'S EMPIRE 
NOR A FIT LABOUR FORCE TO KEEP BRITAIN'S PLACE AS THE LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATION 
DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE CENTURY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ALLOWED TO VOTE THE ELECTORATE 
HAD BEEN EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MORE MEN FROM THE LOWER CLASSES 
TO GAIN THEIR VOTES POLITICAL PARTIES NEEDED TO HAVE POLICIES 
WHICH WOULD IMPROVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING OF THE LESS WELL OFF 
PIONEERING SOCIAL INVESTIGATORS CHARLES BOOTH AND SEEBOHM ROWNTREE 
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR DRAWING THE ATTENTION OF THE UPPER CLASSES TO THE PROBLEM OF URBAN POVERTY 
BOOTH'S INVESTIGATIONS INTO POVERTY IN LONDON SHOWED THAT ONE IN THREE PEOPLE LIVED IN POVERTY 
IT ALSO CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS LOW PAY IRREGULAR WORK AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
THAT WERE MOSTLY TO BLAME FOR POVERTY 
IT WASN'T DOWN TO LAZINESS OR FECKLESSNESS OF THE POOR THEMSELVES 
SEEBOHM ROWNTREE WANTED TO KNOW IF LONDON WAS TYPICAL OR EXCEPTIONAL 
SO HE CARRIED OUT A SURVEY IN YORK 
AND CONCLUDED THAT STATE ACTION WAS NECESSARY 
HOW DID YOU GET ON YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED 
DURING THE BOER WAR VOLUNTEERS FOR THE ARMY HAD TO TAKE A MEDICAL 
ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT OF MEN FAILED 
BUT IN SOME CITY CENTRES THE FIGURE WAS AS HIGH AS NINETY PER CENT 
THE GOVERNMENT BECAME WORRIED THAT THE PEOPLE WERE TOO UNHEALTHY 
AND IN A FUTURE WAR THERE WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO FIGHT 
IN GERMANY THERE WERE SICKNESS AND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE 
DURING THE LAST THIRTY YEARS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY MORE THAN FIVE MILLION PEOPLE HAD GAINED THE VOTE 
POLITICIANS WANTED TO PERSUADE THESE NEW VOTERS TO SUPPORT THEM 
ESPECIALLY AS THE LABOUR REPRESENTATION COMMITTEE THE LABOUR PARTY WAS SET UP IN NINETEEN HUNDRED 
CHARLES BOOTH AND SEEBOHM ROWNTREE CARRIED OUT SURVEYS 
INTO PEOPLE'S LIVES IN LONDON AND YORK THEY FOUND THAT THIRTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE 
LIVED IN ABSOLUTE POVERTY AND THAT THE MAIN REASON WAS LOW PAY 
THIS MEANT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE PEOPLE COULD DO TO HELP THEMSELVES 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON WHY THE LIBERALS DECIDED TO INTRODUCE REFORMS IN NINETEEN OH SIX 
AND HOW DID THE REFORMS CHANGE THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP THEN PAUSE THE TAPE 
AND MAKE NOTES OF THE REFORMS THE LIBERALS INTRODUCED IN THE YEARS FROM NINETEEN OH SIX TO NINETEEN FOURTEEN 
THE LAW ALLOWED LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PROVIDE SCHOOL MEALS FOR CHILDREN SOME FREE PAID OUT OF LOCAL TAXES 
IN THE SHORT TERM IT WAS HOPED A FULL STOMACH WOULD HELP CHILDREN TO PERFORM BETTER IN THEIR STUDIES 
AND IN THE LONG TERM HELP IMPROVE THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE WHOLE POPULATION 
THIS LAW AUTHORISED THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF ALL SCHOOL CHILDREN 
THESE INSPECTIONS SHOWED UP JUST HOW UNHEALTHY CHILDREN WERE 
THE INSPECTIONS ALSO REVEALED THAT SICK CHILDREN WERE NOT BEING TREATED 
BECAUSE PARENTS COULDN'T AFFORD TO PAY THE DOCTOR'S BILLS 
IN NINETEEN TWELVE THE FIRST SCHOOL CLINICS WERE SET UP AS THE GOVERNMENT CAME UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE 
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT WERE BEING EXPOSED 
THESE CLINICS ONLY OFFERED BASIC MEDICAL CARE FROM NURSES 
AND SOMETIMES DOCTORS 
THIS LAW BROUGHT IN STATE PENSIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IF YOU WERE OVER SEVENTY AND WERE CLASSIFIED AS DESERVING 
YOU WERE ENTITLED TO DRAW A WEEKLY PENSION FROM YOUR LOCAL POST OFFICE 
LLOYD GEORGE DESCRIBED THE ACT AS 
LIFTING THE SHADOW OF THE WORKHOUSE FROM THE HOMES OF THE POOR 
WINSTON CHURCHILL WAS MORE MODERATE IN HIS JUDGMENT 
WE HAVE NOT PRETENDED TO CARRY THE TOILER TO DRY LAND 
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS TO STRAP A LIFE BELT AROUND HIM 
THIS LAW WAS THE MOST RADICAL OF THE LIBERAL REFORMS IT CAME IN TWO PARTS 
PART ONE PROVIDED STATE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR ALL LOW PAID WORKERS 
IF THEY WERE ILL THEY HAD FREE TREATMENT FROM A DOCTOR AND WERE PAID SICKNESS BENEFIT WHEN OFF WORK 
PART TWO PROVIDED STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR WORKERS IN A FEW UNSTABLE TRADES LIKE IRON FOUNDING 
AND SHIPBUILDING 
THESE WORKERS RECEIVED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT WHEN THEY WERE OUT OF WORK 
WEEKLY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM WORKERS THEIR EMPLOYERS AND THE GOVERNMENT FINANCED THESE INSURANCE SCHEMES 
LIBERAL POLITICIANS LIKE WINSTON CHURCHILL 
SAW THE NATIONAL INSURANCE ACT AS A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN SOCIAL REFORM 
HOW DID YOU GET ON 
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED 
THE FIRST REFORMS INTRODUCED BY THE LIBERALS WERE INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN 
MEDICAL INSPECTIONS WERE STARTED IN SCHOOLS 
AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WERE ALLOWED TO PROVIDE SCHOOL MEALS FOR THE POOREST CHILDREN 
AND THE CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS ACT CHILDREN'S CHARTER 
STOPPED CHILDREN BUYING ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO AND SET UP JUVENILE COURTS AND PRISONS 
SCHOOL CLINICS WERE SET UP SO THAT CHILDREN COULD RECEIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT 
THE ELDERLY WERE HELPED BY OLD AGE PENSIONS WHICH BEGAN IN NINETEEN OH NINE 
EVERYONE OVER THE AGE OF SEVENTY RECEIVED PAYMENTS 
A CHANGE NOT MENTIONED IN THE CLIP WAS THAT PEOPLE IN SOME LOW PAID JOBS WERE GIVEN FIXED RATES OF PAY 
BY TRADE BOARDS WHICH SET WAGES IN INDUSTRIES WHERE THERE WERE NO TRADE UNIONS 
SICKNESS AND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT WERE PROVIDED BY THE NATIONAL INSURANCE ACT 
WORKERS RECEIVED FIFTEEN WEEKS OF BENEFIT WHEN THEY WERE OUT OF WORK AND TWENTY SIX WEEKS WHEN THEY WERE SICK 
WORKERS ALSO RECEIVED SOME FREE MEDICAL TREATMENT 
UNEMPLOYMENT WAS TACKLED BY SETTING UP LABOUR EXCHANGES IN NINETEEN TEN 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON WHAT EXACTLY DID THE LIBERALS DO 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP THEN PAUSE THE TAPE AND MAKE NOTES OF THE LIMITS ON THE LIBERAL REFORMS 
HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY BENEFITED AND TO WHAT EXTENT 
MEDICAL INSPECTIONS FOR CHILDREN WERE PUT IN PLACE BUT THERE WAS NO FREE HEALTH SERVICE FOR THEM 
MOST PEOPLE WERE ENTITLED TO A PENSION 
BUT THE AMOUNT WAS BELOW THAT NEEDED FOR A MINIMUM STANDARD OF LIVING 
HEALTH INSURANCE WAS INTRODUCED 
BUT IT ONLY COVERED WAGE EARNERS NOT THEIR FAMILIES 
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WAS INTRODUCED 
BUT IT DIDN'T COVER THE BULK OF THE WORKING POPULATION 
SO IN THESE AREAS OF SOCIAL WELFARE YOU COULD SAY THE LIBERAL REFORMS LEFT MAJOR GAPS TO BE PLUGGED 
BUT WHAT WAS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED BY THE LIBERAL REFORMS 
WAS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE STATE HAVING A RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR THE WELFARE OF ITS PEOPLE 
WITHOUT THIS PRINCIPLE HAVING BEEN ACCEPTED NO WELFARE STATE COULD HAVE DEVELOPED 
WHETHER THIS IS ENOUGH TO CALL LLOYD GEORGE THE FATHER OF THE WELFARE STATE IS OPEN TO QUESTION 
HOW DID YOU DO YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTED 
THE LIBERALS DIDN'T INTEND TO TACKLE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF POVERTY AND SICKNESS 
BUT TO PROVIDE A SAFETY NET TO DEAL WITH THE MOST SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES 
MOST WORKERS WEREN'T COVERED THEIR FAMILIES WEREN'T COVERED AT ALL 
PAYMENTS ENDED AFTER A FIXED NUMBER OF WEEKS AND WERE VERY LOW 
MUCH LOWER THAN THE FIGURES WORKED OUT BY BOOTH AND ROWNTREE 
WHEN PAYMENTS STOPPED THE WORKER AND HIS FAMILY HAD TO APPLY TO THE POOR LAW FOR HELP 
WORKHOUSES WEREN'T ABOLISHED UNTIL NINETEEN TWENTY NINE 
THE ONLY ILLNESS TREATED FREE OF CHARGE IN HOSPITALS WAS T. B. 
AND THAT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS SO SERIOUS 
HERE'S A TYPICAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT GET ON THIS TOPIC 
O. K. LET'S WORK THROUGH IT 
THE QUESTION ASKS YOU TO EXPLAIN HOW THINGS CHANGED 
FOR GOOD MARKS YOU MUST SHOW THE DIFFERENCES LIBERAL REFORMS MADE 
AND NOT JUST DESCRIBE THE REFORMS REMEMBER 
NOW STOP REWIND THE TAPE AND HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS WHOLE SECTION 
THEN HAVE A GO 
SO YOUR PLAN FOR YOUR ANSWER SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
BUT REMEMBER WHEN YOU WRITE YOUR FULL ANSWER TO INCLUDE DETAILS OF WHAT DIDN'T CHANGE AS WELL 
THAT'S THE END OF THE WHOLE SECTION ON THE LIBERAL REFORMS 
IN THIS SECTION ABOUT VOTES FOR WOMEN WE'LL LOOK AT 
SO HOW DID WOMEN TRY TO GET THE VOTE 
THERE WERE TWO ORGANISATIONS THE SUFFRAGISTS AND THE SUFFRAGETTES 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP 
THEN PAUSE THE TAPE AND MAKE NOTES OF THE METHODS USED BY THE SUFFRAGISTS AND THE SUFFRAGETTES 
CAMPAIGN FOR EQUAL RIGHTS BEGAN LONG BEFORE ELIZABETH DEAN WAS BORN 
DURING THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTIES A FEW VISIONARY WOMEN AND MEN BEGAN TO QUESTION WOMEN'S LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES 
AND THEIR COMPLETE LEGAL DEPENDENCE ON MEN 
BY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY SOME SIGNIFICANT GAINS HAD BEEN WON 
WOMEN COULD KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTY WHEN THEY MARRIED AND A FEW GIRLS' SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WERE SET UP 
WOMEN RATE PAYERS COULD EVEN VOTE IN LOCAL ELECTIONS AND BECOME COUNTY COUNCILLORS 
BUT IN MILLICENT FAWCETT'S EYES 
WOMEN COULD NEVER ACHIEVE FULL EQUALITY UNTIL THEY HAD THE PARLIAMENTARY VOTE 
MRS. FAWCETT AND HER SUFFRAGISTS LED A SUSTAINED CAMPAIGN 
IN NINETEEN OH THREE A NEW GROUP ARRIVED ON THE SCENE THE SUFFRAGETTES 
IMPATIENT WITH THE GENTEEL TACTICS OF MRS. FAWCETT'S SUFFRAGISTS THEY CALLED FOR MILITANT ACTION 
LED BY THE CHARISMATIC EMMELINE PANKHURST THE SUFFRAGETTES DEVISED COLOURFUL PROTESTS 
DEMANDING VOTES FOR WOMEN DELIBERATELY BREAKING THE LAW IN ORDER TO GAIN MAXIMUM PUBLICITY 
VICTORIA LYDIARD JOINED THEM IN NINETEEN TEN 
AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME MRS. PANKHURST MADE A VERY BIG EFFORT 
TO HAVE SOMETHING VERY BIG DONE 
AND SO IT WAS A CASE OF SMASHING OF WINDOWS 
YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOTTED 
THE NATIONAL UNION OF WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE SOCIETIES THE SUFFRAGISTS WAS SET UP IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN 
THE LEADER WAS MILLICENT FAWCETT 
THEY HELD MARCHES AND ORGANISED PETITIONS TO GET WOMEN THE VOTE 
MANY M. P.'S SUPPORTED THEM BUT THE GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T ALLOW ANY TIME IN PARLIAMENT TO GET AN ACT PASSED 
THE WOMEN'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL UNION THE SUFFRAGETTES WAS SET UP BY EMMELINE PANKHURST IN NINETEEN OH THREE 
THEY BEGAN TO USE VIOLENT METHODS IN NINETEEN OH FIVE BECAUSE PEACEFUL METHODS WEREN'T WORKING 
THEIR METHODS GRADUALLY BECAME MORE AND MORE VIOLENT 
UNTIL EMILY DAVISON THREW HERSELF UNDER THE KINGS'S HORSE AT THE DERBY IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN 
THIS IS THE END OF THE SECTION ON THE SUFFRAGISTS AND THE SUFFRAGETTES 
WATCH THIS CLIP THEN PAUSE THE TAPE AND MAKE NOTES ON THE EFFECTS OF THE SUFFRAGETTE ACTIONS 
BY NINETEEN FOURTEEN SUFFRAGIST ORGANISATIONS HAD OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS 
BUT THEIR PEACEFUL APPROACH MADE LITTLE HEADWAY 
AGAINST THE MALE POWER STRUCTURES OF EDWARDIAN BRITAIN 
AND SO FROM NINETEEN OH THREE EMMELINE PANKHURST AND HER DAUGHTERS 
SET UP A RIVAL MORE RADICAL ORGANISATION 
THE WOMEN'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL UNION 
THESE SUFFRAGETTES ARGUED DON'T LET'S WAIT TO BE GIVEN THE VOTE IT'S OURS BY RIGHT 
LET'S TAKE IT IF THAT MEANT BREAKING THE LAW SO BE IT 
DEEDS NOT WORDS IS OUR MOTTO 
WE WANT THE VOTE AND WE CAN SEE THIS SO CALLED LIBERAL GOVERNMENT IS HOSTILE TO US GETTING THE VOTE 
SO WE MUST FIGHT THIS GOVERNMENT UNTIL THEY ARE CONQUERED OR DRIVEN FROM OFFICE 
FROM NINETEEN OH THREE TO NINETEEN FOURTEEN THE SUFFRAGETTE IMPACT GREW 
MASS RALLIES RESULTED IN CLASHES WITH THE POLICE 
PANKHURST AND OTHERS SPENT TIME IN HOLLOWAY PRISON THEY DEMANDED TO BE TREATED AS POLITICAL PRISONERS 
WHEN THIS WAS REFUSED THEY WENT ON HUNGER STRIKE 
THEY SUFFERED FORCED FEEDING 
NOT SURPRISINGLY ON THEIR RELEASE THEY WERE TREATED AS HEROES 
OF ALL THE PUBLICITY STUNTS OF THE SUFFRAGETTES THE MOST FAMOUS AND THE MOST TRAGIC 
WAS THAT OF EMILY WILDING DAVISON SEEN HERE WITH THE PANKHURSTS IN A PICTURE TAKEN BY CHRISTINA BROOM 
IN JUNE NINETEEN THIRTEEN DAVISON WENT TO EPSOM 
SHE MINGLED WITH THE CROWD AND PUSHED HER WAY TO THE FRONT AS THE HORSES APPROACHED 
HER PLAN WAS TO RUSH ONTO THE COURSE AS THE KING'S HORSE ANMER APPROACHED THUS THROWING THE DERBY 
A PHOTOGRAPHER FROM THE DAILY SKETCH STOOD OPPOSITE AS SHE MADE HER MOVE 
THE PHOTOGRAPH HE TOOK RECORDS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT 
ANMER STRUCK HER WITH HIS CHEST SHE WAS KNOCKED OVER SCREAMING 
BLOOD RUSHED FROM HER NOSE AND MOUTH THE KING'S HORSE TURNED A SOMERSAULT 
AND THE JOCKEY HERBERT JONES WAS KNOCKED OFF AND SERIOUSLY INJURED 
AN IMMENSE CROWD INVADED THE COURSE THE WOMAN WAS PICKED UP 
PUT IN A CAR AND TAKEN BY AMBULANCE TO EPSOM COTTAGE HOSPITAL 
EMILY DAVISON DIED OF HEAD INJURIES THREE DAYS LATER 
THE SUFFRAGETTES ORGANISED A SPECTACULAR FUNERAL 
TWO THOUSAND SUFFRAGETTES ESCORTED HER COFFIN 
BUT THE MORE EXTREME THEIR TACTICS THE MORE THEY ALIENATED CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY 
THEY SMASHED WINDOWS BOMBED POLITICIANS' HOUSES AND THE PUBLIC RECOILED 
LOOK AT THIS IT'S EXTRAORDINARY A SUFFRAGETTE GIVEN POLICE PROTECTION FROM AN ANGRY MOB 
THE SCENE TOOK PLACE IN CRICCIETH IN WALES IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN 
YOU READ ACCOUNTS OF WOMEN CAUGHT BY ANTI SUFFRAGE MOBS SHE'S IN REAL DANGER 
A GROUP OF MEN FOUGHT THEIR WAY TOWARDS US AND PLAYED A KIND OF RUGBY FOOTBALL WITH US 
PUSHING US INTO THE ARMS OF ANOTHER GROUP WHO IN TURN PUSHED US ON 
TWO YOUTHS HELD ONTO MY SKIRTS SO TIGHTLY I FEARED IT WOULD COME OFF OR I'D BE DRAGGED TO THE GROUND 
EVENTUALLY WE MANAGED TO BOARD A TRAMCAR 
THE CROWD SPEEDING OUR DEPARTURE WITH A SHOWER OF CABBAGES 
BY NINETEEN FOURTEEN THE DEBATE RAGED 
WERE THE SUFFRAGETTES' TACTICS HELPING OR DAMAGING THE CAUSE 
BUT THEN SUCH QUESTIONS WERE SWEPT ASIDE BY EVENTS ON THE EUROPEAN STAGE 
HOW DID YOU DO YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTED THE FOLLOWING POINTS 
IN NINETEEN OH EIGHT THEY BEGAN TO THROW STONES AND THEN WENT ON HUNGER STRIKE 
IN NINETEEN ELEVEN THE SUFFRAGETTE CAMPAIGN BECAME EVEN MORE VIOLENT 
AND THEY BEGAN TO ATTACK PROPERTY 
THEY BURNED DOWN THE HOUSES OF POLITICIANS AND DESTROYED CHURCHES 
YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN 
THEY SLASHED FAMOUS PAINTINGS SUCH AS THE ROKEBY VENUS 
THE VIOLENCE OF THE SUFFRAGETTES BEGAN TO LOSE THEM SUPPORT 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IN NINETEEN TWELVE THE SUFFRAGISTS BROKE AWAY FROM THEM COMPLETELY 
AS THE SUFFRAGETTES BECAME MORE VIOLENT 
THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T WANT TO APPEAR TO BE GIVING IN TO WOMEN BEHAVING LIKE TERRORISTS 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON THE EFFECTS OF THE SUFFRAGETTE ACTIONS 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP THEN PAUSE THE TAPE AND MAKE NOTES ON WHY WOMEN GOT THE VOTE 
WHILE THOUSANDS OF MEN LOST THEIR LIVES IN FRANCE WOMEN WERE CALLED ON TO VOLUNTEER FOR SERVICE TOO 
WE SHALL CHEER YOU THANK YOU 
BLESS YOU 
WHEN YOU COME BACK AGAIN 
THEY DID HEAVY DIRTY AND PHYSICALLY DANGEROUS JOBS 
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE BEFORE THE WAR 
MANY HAD THEIR FIRST TASTE OF THEIR OWN PAY PACKET AND FOUND THEY LIKED IT 
MRS. PANKHURST ABANDONED HER CAMPAIGN FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND THREW HERSELF INTO THE RECRUITING EFFORT 
HER SUFFRAGETTE MOVEMENT FOLDED IN AN ORGY OF PATRIOTISM 
WE SHALL CHEER YOU THANK YOU 
MRS. FAWCETT'S SUFFRAGISTS WHILE SUPPORTING THE WAR EVEN SENDING NURSING UNITS TO THE FRONT LINE 
CONTINUED TO PRESS FOR THE VOTE 
IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN THEIR TIRELESS EFFORTS OVER FIFTY YEARS WERE FINALLY REWARDED 
ONLY A MONTH AFTER ARMISTICE DAY ALL MEN BUT ONLY WOMEN OVER THIRTY VOTED IN THEIR FIRST ELECTION 
TO THE DISMAY OF FEMINISTS OF THE SEVENTEEN WOMEN CANDIDATES 
ONLY ONE WAS SUCCESSFUL CONSTANCE MARKIEWICZ 
BUT AS A GOOD SINN FEINER SHE REFUSED TO TAKE HER SEAT IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT 
ELECTED IN A BY ELECTION NEXT YEAR NANCY ASTOR BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN 
TO TAKE HER SEAT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
HOW DID YOU DO YOU MAY HAVE NOTED SOME OF THE FOLLOWING POINTS 
MORE THAN TWO MILLION WOMEN WORKED IN WAR FACTORIES 
SOME MADE MUNITIONS FOR THE ARMY 
THIS WAS DANGEROUS WORK AND MANY WOMEN WERE KILLED IN EXPLOSIONS 
OTHER WOMEN JOINED THE ARMED FORCES OR WORKED ON THE LAND 
THIS CONVINCED MANY PEOPLE THAT THEY DESERVED THE RIGHT TO VOTE 
YOU SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER 
YOU COULD ONLY VOTE IF YOU'D LIVED IN BRITAIN AT LEAST SIX MONTHS 
POLITICIANS FEARED THE SUFFRAGETTES MIGHT START THEIR CAMPAIGNS AGAIN 
SO WOMEN WERE GIVEN THE VOTE AT THE AGE OF THIRTY IF THEY WERE HOUSEHOLDERS 
OR MARRIED TO HOUSEHOLDERS SO WOMEN WERE STILL NOT EQUAL TO MEN 
HERE'S A TYPICAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT GET ON THIS TOPIC 
THE QUESTION ASKS YOU TO EXPLAIN WHY 
TO GET GOOD MARKS YOU MUST SORT THE REASONS INTO THE CORRECT ORDER AND EXPLAIN HOW ONE LED TO ANOTHER 
SO YOU WOULDN'T GET MANY MARKS JUST BY DESCRIBING WHAT HAPPENED 
STOP REWIND THE TAPE 
HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS WHOLE SECTION AND THEN HAVE A GO 
SO YOUR PLAN FOR THE ANSWER SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
THAT'S THE END OF THE WHOLE SECTION ON VOTES FOR WOMEN 
IN THIS SECTION ABOUT THE HOME FRONT DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR WE'LL LOOK AT 
FIRST HOW WERE SOLDIERS RECRUITED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR 
AT THE BEGINNING OF WWI THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T EXPECT THE WAR WOULD LAST LONG 
THE PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCED IT WOULD BE BUSINESS AS USUAL SO HE RELIED ON VOLUNTEERS FOR THE ARMY 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP THEN PAUSE THE TAPE 
AND NOTE DOWN THE WAYS VOLUNTEERS WERE ENCOURAGED TO SIGN UP 
IN AUGUST NINETEEN FOURTEEN BRITAIN HAD AN ARMY OF JUST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN 
THIS BRITISH EXPEDITIONARY FORCE WAS SENT TO BELGIUM TO BOLSTER THE FRENCH LINE 
BUT THEY FACED A GERMAN ARMY OF OVER TWO MILLION 
LORD KITCHENER MINISTER FOR WAR CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS APPEALING TO BRITISH PATRIOTISM 
THE RESPONSE EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS 
WITHIN A WEEK ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN HAD COME FORWARD 
WITHIN A MONTH THE FIGURE HAD RISEN TO THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION 
THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF PROPAGANDA CARTOONS THE GOVERNMENT USED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO VOLUNTEER 
HOW DID YOU DO YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT USED 
THE MOST FAMOUS METHOD OF RECRUITMENT IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN WAS POSTERS 
THE MOST FAMOUS OF ALL SHOWED LORD KITCHENER BUT THERE WERE MANY OTHERS 
YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THERE WERE SONGS AND ACTRESSES IN MUSIC HALLS APPEALED FOR VOLUNTEERS 
ONCE A LOCAL MAYOR APPEALED AT A FOOTBALL MATCH 
BUT AS THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES GREW FEWER MEN CAME FORWARD 
IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN THE TONE OF POSTERS BEGAN TO CHANGE 
PRESSURE WAS PUT ON MEN BY IMPLYING THEIR CHILDREN MIGHT ASK AWKWARD QUESTIONS AFTER THE WAR 
WOMEN WERE ASKED TO PERSUADE THEIR HUSBANDS BROTHERS AND SONS TO VOLUNTEER 
THEY STUCK WHITE FEATHERS ON THE JACKETS OF MEN NOT IN UNIFORM 
SOMETIMES THEY EVEN SPAT IN THEIR FACES 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON RECRUITMENT DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
SO WHAT IMPACT DID CONSCRIPTION HAVE 
WATCH THE NEXT CLIP AND SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT 
IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN LLOYD GEORGE REPLACED ASQUITH AS HEAD OF A COALITION GOVERNMENT 
FACED WITH FALLING RECRUITS HE INTRODUCED CONSCRIPTION 
THE COMPULSORY ENLISTMENT FIRST OF SINGLE MEN THEN MARRIED MEN INTO THE ARMY 
IN THIS STRUGGLE TO KEEP PEOPLE BEHIND THE WAR PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE TO PLAY A CRUCIAL PART 
ONE STORY DOESN'T DO MUCH CREDIT TO MY PROFESSION 
ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE MIRROR IT'S ABOUT CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS 
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS SUFFERED THE IGNOMINY OF BEING OUTSIDERS AT A TIME OF NATIONAL TOGETHERNESS 
BECAUSE THIS WAS A CONFLICT IN WHICH EVERYONE WAS MEANT TO PLAY THEIR PART 
SO YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED THAT 
THE MILITARY SERVICE ACTS FORCED ALL MEN OVER EIGHTEEN TO JOIN THE ARMY 
FIRST SINGLE MEN WERE CALLED UP LATER MARRIED MEN WERE INCLUDED 
MEN COULD ASK TO BE EXEMPT AND COULD USE FOUR REASONS 
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS WERE NOT POPULAR 
SOME WERE SHOT AFTER A COURT MARTIAL 
LATER ATTITUDES IMPROVED 
THERE WERE TWO TYPES OF CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR 
THEY USUALLY BECAME MEDICAL ORDERLIES OR DROVE AMBULANCES 
THEY WERE SENT TO HOME OFFICE CENTRES WHERE THEY WERE TREATED VERY BADLY ABOUT SEVENTY DIED 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON CONSCRIPTION DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
NOW WE LOOK AT HOW WOMEN HELPED IN THE WAR EFFORT 
WATCH THE CLIP THEN PAUSE THE TAPE AND MAKE NOTES ON HOW WOMEN BECAME MORE INVOLVED IN THE WAR EFFORT 
THE SUFFRAGETTES CALLED OFF THEIR CAMPAIGN AS SOON AS WAR BROKE OUT 
MOST WOMEN FELT IT WAS THEIR DUTY TO HELP THE WAR EFFORT 
OH WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU 
BUT WE THINK YOU OUGHT TO GO 
AT FIRST THEY ENCOURAGED MEN TO ENLIST AND PROVIDED THINGS FOR THE TROOPS 
THEY COLLECTED MILLIONS OF CIGARETTES BOOKS AND SOCKS 
AND MISS YOU 
BUT WITH ALL OUR MIGHT AND MAIN 
WE SHALL CHEER YOU THANK YOU BLESS YOU 
BY NINETEEN FIFTEEN THERE WAS A SHORTAGE OF WORKERS AS SO MANY MEN HAD JOINED UP 
IN THIS TOTAL WAR WOMEN NEEDED TO TAKE OVER JOBS ALWAYS DONE BY MEN 
WE THINK YOU OUGHT TO GO FOR YOUR KING AND YOUR COUNTRY 
OF ALL THE PROFESSIONS WOMEN TOOK OVER ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS SHELL MAKING 
IN BRITAIN ONE MILLION WOMEN WENT TO WORK IN THE MUNITIONS FACTORIES LIKE THE WOOLWICH ARSENAL 
THE FUMES OFTEN MEAN SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN CASUALTIES A NIGHT 
YOU'RE BLIND AND SPEECHLESS BY THE TIME YOU ESCAPE 
SOME OF THE CASUALTIES WEREN'T SERIOUS 
WOMEN CUT THEIR FINGERS OR GOT GRIT IN THEIR EYES BUT SOMETIMES THEY WERE KILLED BY EXPLODING SHELLS 
WHAT MANY OF THE WOMEN DIDN'T REALISE AT THE TIME 
WAS THAT THEY WERE BEING KILLED SLOWLY BY THE EXPLOSIVES 
ALL THE TIME THEY WERE IN THE FACTORY THEY WERE BREATHING IN THE POISONOUS FUMES OF THE T. N. T. 
WAR WORK WAS DANGEROUS 
BUT THE WOMEN KNEW THAT WITHOUT THEIR SUPPLY OF SHELLS AND BULLETS THE MEN WOULD LOSE THE WAR 
THE WOMEN BELIEVED THAT AFTER THE WAR THEIR WORK WOULD WIN THEM THE VOTE AND RECOGNITION 
BUT AS THE MEN RETURNED WOMEN WERE FORCED OUT OF THEIR JOBS 
AND EQUAL VOTING RIGHTS WITH MEN WERE NOT ACHIEVED UNTIL NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT 
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED THAT 
WHEN THE WAR BEGAN MOST PEOPLE BELIEVED IT WOULD BE OVER BY CHRISTMAS SO WOMEN WERE IGNORED 
THEY WERE JUST EXPECTED TO KNIT GLOVES AND SCARVES FOR THE TROOPS 
THE TURNING POINT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT CAME IN MAY NINETEEN FIFTEEN 
THE ARMY RAN SHORT OF SHELLS AND LLOYD GEORGE BEGAN TO RECRUIT WOMEN TO WORK IN MUNITIONS FACTORIES 
POSTERS AND FILMS WERE PRODUCED TO ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO VOLUNTEER 
MANY WOMEN WERE KEEN TO VOLUNTEER AS THEY WANTED TO HELP WIN THE WAR 
THERE WAS ALSO HIGHER PAY IN FACTORIES 
MANY WOMEN WHO'D WORKED AS DOMESTIC SERVANTS BEFORE THE WAR LEFT TO WORK IN MUNITIONS FACTORIES 
IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN MANY MORE WOMEN WENT TO WORK IN WAR FACTORIES 
BECAUSE MEN WERE FORCED TO JOIN THE ARMY 
HERE'S A TYPICAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT GET ON THIS TOPIC 
THE IMPORTANT POINT TO NOTE IS THAT THE QUESTION ASKS YOU TO 
SO LET'S WORK THROUGH IT 
THE QUESTION ASKS YOU TO EXPLAIN IN WHAT WAYS TO GET GOOD MARKS 
STOP REWIND THE TAPE AND HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS WHOLE SECTION 
THEN HAVE A GO AT THE QUESTION 
YOUR PLAN FOR THE ANSWER SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
THAT'S THE END OF THE WHOLE SECTION ON THE HOME FRONT NINETEEN FOURTEEN TO NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
IN THIS SECTION ON THE GENERAL STRIKE WE'LL LOOK AT 
FIRST WE LOOK AT 
DURING WWI THE COAL MINES WERE TAKEN OVER BY THE GOVERNMENT 
PRODUCTION ROSE AND SO DID WAGES SAFETY ALSO IMPROVED 
BUT AT THE END OF THE WAR THE SANKEY COMMISSION WAS SET UP 
WATCH THE NEXT CLIP THEN PAUSE THE TAPE 
AND NOTE DOWN WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COAL MINES FROM NINETEEN NINETEEN TO NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE 
BEFORE THE WAR THE TRIPLE INDUSTRIAL ALLIANCE WAS FOUNDED 
UNITING MINERS RAILWAYMEN AND TRANSPORT WORKERS 
IT WAS POTENTIALLY A FORMIDABLE WEAPON 
THE COAL OWNERS WERE THE FIRST EMPLOYERS TO TEST ITS STRENGTH 
THE STRUGGLE IN THE COAL INDUSTRY SHARPENED IN NINETEEN NINETEEN 
THE MINERS DEMANDED AN INCREASE IN WAGES SHORTER HOURS 
AND NATIONALISATION OF MINES WITH A DEGREE OF WORKERS' CONTROL 
THE GOVERNMENT WHICH CONTROLLED THE MINES WAS IMMEDIATELY IMPLICATED 
UNWILLING TO CHALLENGE THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE LLOYD GEORGE ASKED THE MINERS TO POSTPONE STRIKE ACTION 
AND JOIN A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CONDITIONS IN THE INDUSTRY AND NATIONALISATION 
SIR JOHN SANKEY WAS CALLED TO CHAIR THE NEW COMMISSION 
WHEN THE REPORTS APPEARED THE MAJORITY INCLUDING SANKEY'S 
ADVOCATED NATIONALISATION AS THE ONLY LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR THE INDUSTRY 
BUT LLOYD GEORGE ARGUED THAT THE ABSENCE OF UNANIMITY ENABLED HIM BREAK HIS PLEDGE 
HE REFUSED TO NATIONALISE 
THE MINERS FELT THEY'D BEEN DUPED 
BUT FOR THEM WORSE WAS TO COME 
WITHOUT WARNING THE GOVERNMENT RELINQUISHED CONTROL OF THE MINES 
THE OWNERS REACTED INSTANTLY 
WITH WAGE CUTS BETWEEN FORTY AND FORTY NINE PER CENT 
UNIONS FELT THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION WAS AN EXPLICIT ATTACK UPON THE WHOLE LABOUR MOVEMENT 
THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE ISSUED STRIKE NOTICES 
TO RAILWAYMEN AND TRANSPORT WORKERS 
APRIL FIFTEENTH NINETEEN TWENTY ONE 
BLACK FRIDAY MARKED THE COLLAPSE OF THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE 
AND THE BEGINNING OF SAVAGE WAGE CUTS IN EVERY INDUSTRY 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE MINERS WERE FACED BY THE PROSPECT OF MORE PAY CUTS 
IN THE COAL INDUSTRY WHICH WAS ALREADY IN A VERY BAD STATE 
AND WAGES WERE VERY LOW 
THE RESULT WOULD BE THAT IF A COAL OWNER WANTED TO SELL COAL 
HE'D HAVE TO PUT UP HIS PRICES IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET BY TEN TO TWELVE PER CENT 
THAT WOULD PRICE HIM RIGHT OUT OF THE MARKET 
WHAT IN FACT HE DID WAS TO SAY 
THAT THE ALREADY LOW WAGES OF THE MINERS SHOULD BE REDUCED FURTHER 
THE COAL OWNERS WERE UNMOVED 
MINERS HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WAGE CUTS OR A LOCKOUT 
AS THE STORM CLOUDS GATHERED THE GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE TUC 
ANNOUNCED A NATIONAL EMBARGO ON THE MOVEMENT OF COAL TO TAKE EFFECT 
ON THIRTY FIRST JULY NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE AT MIDNIGHT 
THEN SUDDENLY THE PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCED A GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY OF TEN MILLION TO RUN FOR NINE MONTHS 
WHILE A COMMISSION EXAMINED THE COAL INDUSTRY IN DETAIL 
IT'S A VICTORY FOR COMMON SENSE PROCLAIMED THE TIMES 
RED FRIDAY SANG THE DAILY HERALD 
WORKERS EVERYWHERE RECEIVED THE NEWS WITH JUBILATION 
BLACK FRIDAY HAD BEEN VINDICATED 
AS THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY EXPIRED THE LOCKOUT CAME INTO FORCE 
MAY DAY NINETEEN TWENTY SIX WAS LIKE NO OTHER 
A MASSIVE TURNOUT OF WORKERS AT HYDE PARK AWAITED NEWS FROM THE LEADERS 
AT MEMORIAL HALL DELEGATES REPRESENTING THREE MILLION WORKERS 
VOTED TO GIVE THE GENERAL COUNCIL SPECIAL POWERS 
TO COORDINATE ACTION TO TAKE EFFECT ON MONDAY MAY THIRD 
ON MAY SECOND AN UNOFFICIAL DISPUTE ERUPTED AT THE DAILY MAIL 
WHEN WORKERS REFUSED TO PRINT AN ATTACK ON THE TRADE UNIONS 
EDITOR THOMAS MARLOWE A RIGHT WING TORY IMMEDIATELY REPORTED IT TO DOWNING STREET BY TELEPHONE 
IT'S A DIRECT CHALLENGE SAID BALDWIN 
I'M SORRY THIS IS THE END 
THAT WAS AN ACT OF WAR NOT A RESPONSE OF A PRIME MINISTER 
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED 
THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED THAT THE MINES BE KEPT IN PUBLIC OWNERSHIP 
BUT THEY WENT BACK TO THE OWNERS 
THEY ANNOUNCED PAY CUTS AND MINERS ASKED OTHER UNIONS TO BACK THEM 
AT THE LAST MOMENT THE OTHER UNIONS PULLED OUT IN APRIL NINETEEN TWENTY ONE 
THIS WAS BLACK FRIDAY MINERS' WAGES WENT DOWN SAFETY GOT WORSE 
YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW THAT 
BECAUSE GERMAN COAL WAS CHEAPER THAN BRITISH COAL 
MINERS AGAIN CALLED FOR A STRIKE AND THE OTHER UNIONS BACKED THEM 
BUT THE GOVERNMENT INTERVENED WITH A SUBSIDY 
IN THE CLIP IT SAID TEN MILLION BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY TWENTY THREE MILLION 
THIS WAS KNOWN AS RED FRIDAY AND WOULD KEEP MINERS' WAGES AT THE SAME LEVEL FOR ANOTHER NINE MONTHS 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON WHY A GENERAL STRIKE TOOK PLACE IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX 
THE SUBSIDY RAN OUT ON THIRTIETH APRIL NINETEEN TWENTY SIX AND THE MINERS WENT ON STRIKE THE NEXT DAY 
THE OTHER UNIONS CAME OUT ON STRIKE ON THIRD MAY 
WATCH THIS CLIP PAUSE THE TAPE AND MAKE NOTES OF WHAT HAPPENED NEXT 
TROOPS WERE DRAFTED TO LONDON SOUTH WALES LANCASHIRE AND SCOTLAND 
HYDE PARK WAS TURNED INTO A FOOD AND FUEL DEPOT OVERNIGHT 
THE OMS HANDED OVER ITS ORGANISATION TO THE GOVERNMENT THE MACHINERY OF THE STATE WAS BROUGHT INTO ACTION 
THE FIRST ISSUE OF THE BRITISH GAZETTE APPEARED ON MAY FIFTH 
AT THE OFFICES OF THE MORNING POST ARTISTS COFFEE PLANTERS DOCTORS CLERKS AND OTHER VOLUNTEERS 
PUBLISHED THE GOVERNMENT'S NEWSPAPER 
UNDER THE EDITORSHIP OF WINSTON CHURCHILL 
THE STRIKERS ALSO HAD A NEWSPAPER 
THE BRITISH WORKER ORGAN OF THE TUC 
MILDER THAN NEWS BULLETINS PRINTED BY STRIKERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
IT WAS THE ACTIONS OF THE VOLUNTEERS THAT MOST ANGERED THE STRIKERS 
THE TRAMS COULD NEVER GO FAR DOWN THE LINE 
BECAUSE THE STRIKERS SCREWED NUTS AND BOLTS INTO THE CENTRAL LINE WHICH CARRIED THE POWER 
THE TRAM DROVE DOWN THEN ITS WHOLE UNDER STRUCTURE WAS STRIPPED OFF IT 
AND THERE WERE DISABLED TRAMS STANDING ABOUT IN VARIOUS PARTS 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER 
CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT IS BEING ATTACKED 
THE LAWS OF ENGLAND ARE THE PEOPLE'S BIRTHRIGHT 
THE LAWS ARE IN YOUR KEEPING 
YOU HAVE MADE PARLIAMENT THEIR GUARDIAN 
THE GENERAL STRIKE IS A CHALLENGE TO PARLIAMENT AND IS THE ROAD TO ANARCHY AND RUIN 
ON TUESDAY MAY SIXTH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
LIBERAL LAWYER AND M. P. SIR JOHN SIMON DENOUNCED THE STRIKE AS AN ILLEGAL ACT 
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED THE FOLLOWING 
WHEN THE STRIKE BEGAN THE UNIONS EXPECTED AN EASY VICTORY 
BUT THE PRIME MINISTER HAD MADE CAREFUL PREPARATIONS 
HE HAD SEVENTY THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS IN THE ORGANISATION FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SUPPLIES THE OMS 
HE HAD TROOPS AND POLICE READY TO ESCORT CONVOYS OF FOOD 
HE'D USED THE NINE MONTH DELAY TO STOCKPILE SUPPLIES OF COAL 
THE UNIONS HAD NO REAL PLANS AND WERE SURPRISED BY THE PREPARATIONS 
STRIKERS BECAME DISHEARTENED 
WHEN ATTACKED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND CALLED TRAITORS 
THE GOVERNMENT SET UP A PAPER 
THE BRITISH GAZETTE EDITED BY CHURCHILL 
HE CALLED WORKERS REVOLUTIONARIES 
AND ACCUSED THEM OF TRYING TO OVERTHROW PARLIAMENT 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE GENERAL STRIKE 
THE GENERAL STRIKE WAS A GREAT VICTORY FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND A GREAT DEFEAT FOR THE TRADE UNIONS 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP PAUSE THE TAPE AND NOTE DOWN WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF THE STRIKE 
WE BEGAN TO HEAR RUMOURS THAT THE STRIKE WAS OVER 
WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THESE 
IT WAS IN FACT AN UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER 
WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED 
AND I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANNOUNCING IT FROM THE STEPS OF RUSKIN HOUSE CROYDON 
THEY SIMPLY WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT I DIDN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT MYSELF 
PEOPLE EVEN WEPT 
WHEN I GOT BACK THERE THE STATIONMASTER GAVE ME A FORM TO SIGN 
THE CONDITIONS OF MY RE ENTRY BACK TO THE RAILWAY STAFF 
WAS THAT I SIGN THIS FORM 
AND THAT ON ANY FUTURE OCCASION THAT I DID COME ON STRIKE 
THAT THIS WOULD SIGNIFY THAT I'D HAVE IMMEDIATE DISMISSAL 
AND WOULD NOT BE RE EMPLOYED BY THE RAILWAYS 
THE MINERS CONTINUED THE STRUGGLE ALONE FOR SEVEN PAINFUL MONTHS 
UNTIL STARVATION DROVE THEM TO WORK FOR WHATEVER WAGES THEY WERE OFFERED 
THAT WAS WHAT BEAT THE MINERS STARVATION 
IT WASN'T THAT THE SPIRIT WASN'T THERE IT WAS 
ONLY THE MINERS COULDN'T FACE STARVATION 
THEREFORE WE JUST HAD TO WIND UP 
THE TORY GOVERNMENT DIDN'T STOP THERE THE ECONOMY WAS IN CHAOS AND UNEMPLOYMENT WAS OUT OF CONTROL 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN THEY PASSED THE PUNITIVE TRADE DISPUTES ACT 
WHICH WEAKENED THE UNIONS AND UNDERMINED LABOUR'S ECONOMIC BASE 
OVER THERE WAS A STATUE OF WILLIAM WILBERFORCE 
WHO ABOLISHED SLAVERY IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE 
THAT WAS A LAUGH 
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED THAT THE TUC GAVE IN AFTER NINE DAYS 
BECAUSE IT WAS ACCUSED OF TRYING TO START A REVOLUTION 
THE MINERS STAYED OUT BUT HAD TO GO BACK ON THE OWNERS' TERMS 
ALTHOUGH THE P. M. PROMISED STRIKERS WOULD BE FAIRLY TREATED 
SOME WERE DISMISSED OR DEMOTED 
TRAIN DRIVERS WERE FORCED TO WORK AS PLATFORM STAFF 
YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW THAT 
THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT POLITICAL PARTIES USUALLY LABOUR 
WITH MONEY FROM SUBSCRIPTIONS UNLESS MEMBERS REFUSED PERMISSION 
FROM NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN THE MEMBERS HAD TO GIVE THEIR PERMISSION 
THIS MEANT A BIG REDUCTION IN INCOME FOR THE LABOUR PARTY 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN GENERAL STRIKES WERE MADE ILLEGAL 
IN FUTURE IT WAS ONLY LAWFUL TO TAKE PART IN A STRIKE 
IF WORKERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE DISPUTE 
THEY COULDN'T STRIKE IN SYMPATHY WITH SOMEONE ELSE 
HERE'S A TYPICAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT GET ON THIS TOPIC 
THE QUESTION'S ASKING YOU TO EXPLAIN TO GET GOOD MARKS 
TO GET THE BEST MARKS 
SO STOP REWIND THE TAPE 
AND LOOK AGAIN AT THIS WHOLE SECTION THEN TRY THE QUESTION 
YOUR PLAN FOR THE ANSWER SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS 
THAT'S THE END OF THE WHOLE SECTION ON THE GENERAL STRIKE 
NOW WE MOVE ON TO THE DEPRESSION IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
IN THIS SECTION ABOUT THE DEPRESSION IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
WE'LL LOOK AT 
FIRST WHAT EFFECTS DID THE WALL STREET CRASH HAVE ON BRITAIN 
WITHIN A FEW YEARS ABOUT THREE MILLION PEOPLE WERE OUT OF WORK 
WATCH THE NEXT CLIP THEN PAUSE THE TAPE 
AND MAKE NOTES ON THE EFFECTS THAT THE WALL STREET CRASH IN AMERICA HAD ON THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN 
IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AMERICANS WERE ENJOYING THE FRUITS OF A NEW PROSPERITY 
THE GREATEST INDUSTRIAL NATION FIZZED AHEAD IN A POST WAR BOOM 
FOR THOSE WHO HAD MONEY IT WAS A TIME TO GET RICH QUICK 
BELIEVING THEY COULD ONLY WIN A MILLION AMERICANS HAD THEIR MONEY IN THE STOCK EXCHANGE 
IN JUST FOUR YEARS THEIR SHARES ROARED UP FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT 
THEN ON THE MORNING OF OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN TWENTY NINE THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENED 
ALL OF A SUDDEN THESE ORDERS STARTED POURING IN EVERYTHING WAS SELL 
IT WAS JUST DOWN DOWN DOWN THE MARKET KEPT GOING DOWN 
THE TREMENDOUS CROWDS WHICH YOU SEE GATHERED OUTSIDE THE STOCK EXCHANGE 
ARE DUE TO THE GREATEST CRASH IN THE HISTORY OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE 
THE CRASH AFFECTED PEOPLE FAR BEYOND WALL STREET 
THE GREATEST VICTIMS WERE NOT THE WEALTHY BUT WORKING PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD 
CAPITALISM HAD PROMISED PROGRESS AND PROSPERITY FOR ALL 
INSTEAD IT DELIVERED MASS UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE BREADLINE 
AS PEOPLE HAD LESS TO SPEND AND TRADE SLOWED MORE FACTORIES CLOSED IN ONE COUNTRY AFTER ANOTHER 
IT SEEMED UNSTOPPABLE FORCES WERE AT WORK WHICH INDIVIDUAL GOVERNMENTS COULD DO NOTHING TO CONTROL 
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED 
IN OCTOBER NINETEEN TWENTY NINE PRICES ON THE NEW YORK STOCK MARKET CRASHED 
PEOPLE LOST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND STOPPED BUYING GOODS 
TRADE FELL AND FACTORIES CLOSED MANY WORKERS BECAME UNEMPLOYED 
THE CRASH AFFECTED COUNTRIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD 
YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW THAT 
IN THE U. K. THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT WAS UNABLE TO PAY UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT 
AND RAN OUT OF MONEY IN NINETEEN THIRTY ONE 
U. S. BANKS OFFERED A LOAN BUT ONLY IF BENEFITS WERE REDUCED 
THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT REFUSED AND DECIDED TO RESIGN 
KING GEORGE V. PERSUADED THE LABOUR PRIME MINISTER RAMSAY MACDONALD 
TO STAY ON AND LEAD A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT 
YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT REDUCED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT 
AND INTRODUCED THE MEANS TEST 
THIS MEANT THAT AFTER A WORKER HAD BEEN OUT OF WORK FOR A YEAR 
HE HAD TO HAVE AN INSPECTION OF HIS HOUSE INCOME AND BELONGINGS 
BEFORE HE COULD RECEIVE FURTHER PAYMENTS THE DOLE 
THIS WAS VERY UNPOPULAR 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON THE IMPACT OF THE WALL STREET CRASH 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP PAUSE THE TAPE 
AND MAKE NOTES OF THE REASONS 
BRITAIN WAS SO BADLY AFFECTED BY THE DEPRESSION BECAUSE SHE WAS SO DEPENDENT ON WORLD TRADE 
MANY OF THE INDUSTRIES UPON WHICH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE EMPLOYED 
HAD EXPORTED ENORMOUSLY BEFORE THE GREAT WAR THE GREAT WAR REDUCED WORLD TRADE 
AND NEW RIVALS LIKE JAPAN WERE CLAIMING BRITAIN'S MARKET 
THOUSANDS WERE THROWN OUT OF WORK IN THE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHICH HAD DEPENDED ON THESE INDUSTRIES 
THE WALL STREET CRASH OF NINETEEN TWENTY NINE HIT THEM STILL HARDER 
SOME OF THESE INDUSTRIES WERE HAMMERED THROWING THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OUT OF WORK 
GOVERNMENTS FELT THERE WAS LITTLE THEY COULD DO THEY WERE WAITING FOR NATURAL RECOVERY FOR BETTER TIMES 
MEANWHILE THE DOLE QUEUES LENGTHENED 
THE WELSH MINING VALLEYS WERE NUMB WITH DISTRESS 
IN WIGAN ONE MAN IN THREE WAS ON THE DOLE 
THE MINING VILLAGES OF COUNTY DURHAM THE STEELWORKS OF TYNE AND TEES WERE DERELICT 
SO IT WAS IN SCOTLAND IN GLASGOW HALF THE POPULATION WAS UNEMPLOYED 
ONE OUT OF TWO SHOPS APPEARED TO BE PERMANENTLY CLOSED 
WHEREVER WE WENT THERE WERE MEN HANGING ABOUT HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF THEM 
THE WHOLE TOWN LOOKED AS IF IT HAD ENTERED A PERPETUAL PENNILESS BLEAK SABBATH 
THE MEN WORE THE DRAWN MASKS OF PRISONERS OF WAR 
IN THE WORST YEAR NINETEEN THIRTY TWO UNEMPLOYMENT REACHED THREE MILLION 
YOU'LL BE CLOSING DOWN AT THE END OF THE MONTH 
IT GOT YOU SLOWLY 
WITH THE SLIPPED STEALTH OF AN UNEXPECTED MALIGNANT DISEASE 
YOU FELL INTO THE HABIT OF SLOUCHING OF PUTTING YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS 
OF GLANCING AT PEOPLE FURTIVELY ASHAMED OF YOUR SECRET 
UNTIL YOU FANCIED EVERYBODY EYED YOU WITH SUSPICION 
YOU KNEW THAT YOUR SHABBINESS BETRAYED YOU 
YOU PRAYED FOR THE WINTER EVENINGS AND THE KINDLY DARKNESS DARKNESS POVERTY'S CLOAK 
NOTHING TO DO ALL THE TIME NOTHING TO SPEND NOTHING TO DO TOMORROW NOR THE DAY AFTER NOTHING TO WEAR 
YOU CAN'T GET MARRIED A LIVING CORPSE 
A UNIT OF THE SPECTRAL ARMY OF THREE MILLION LOST MEN 
PEOPLE FELT THEIR LIVES HOPES THEIR TALENTS WERE LOST 
IF ONLY HE HAD WORK JUST IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE 
ON THE WHOLE MY HUSBAND HAS WORKED ABOUT ONE YEAR OUT OF TWELVE 
HIS FACE WAS LOVELY WHEN I MARRIED HIM BUT NOW HE'S SKIN AND BONES 
WHEN WE MARRIED HE HAD A GOOD JOB HE WAS EARNING EIGHT TO TEN A WEEK 
HE'S A LEFT HANDED SHIP'S RIVETER A CRAFT WHICH WOULD BE EARNING HIM A LOT OF MONEY 
HE FELL OUT OF WORK ABOUT A WEEK AFTER WE WERE MARRIED 
MANY KEPT ON TRYING TO FIND WORK EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMED HOPELESS 
FOR THOSE OUT OF WORK THERE WAS UNEMPLOYMENT PAY AVAILABLE FOR TWENTY SIX WEEKS 
THEN YOU WERE ON THE DOLE 
FATHER RETURNED AT LUNCH TIME WITH FOOD VOUCHERS TO LAST US FOR TWO DAYS 
IT WAS EXPECTED THAT WE WOULD BE GRANTED FORTY THREE SHILLINGS PER WEEK 
THIS SUM MUST COVER EVERYTHING FOR NINE PEOPLE 
RENT FOOD CLOTHING HEATING LIGHTING AND THE THOUSAND AND ONE NEEDS OF A GROWING FAMILY 
MOTHER LOOKED AT HIM DISBELIEVINGLY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE SHE SAID 
HER UNPAINTED FACE PUCKERED UP WITH SURPRISE SHE WAS USED TO SPENDING MORE THAN THAT ON A HAT 
EVEN THE DOLE WAS SUBJECT TO THE HATED MEANS TEST 
FIRST INTRODUCED IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN THIRTY ONE 
IT DELVED INTO THE MOST INTIMATE DETAILS OF AN UNEMPLOYED MAN'S FAMILY LIFE 
AND TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE EARNINGS OF ALL THE FAMILY 
OFFICIALS WERE SENT TO CHECK PEOPLE'S HOMES 
SOMEONE CAME TO YOUR HOUSE AND MADE YOU DISPOSE OF WHAT THEY CONSIDERED TO BE SUPERFLUOUS TO YOUR NEEDS 
SO HE HAD A GOOD LOOK ROUND OPENED DRAWERS CUPBOARDS 
EVEN COUNTED THE TEACUPS 
AND FINALLY IN DISGUST HE SAID 
THREE IN THE FAMILY YOU'VE GOT FOUR CHAIRS IN HERE GET RID OF ONE OF THEM 
I THINK WE GOT TWO SHILLINGS FOR IT 
THE DOLE ITSELF WAS NOT ENOUGH TO LIVE ON 
IT MEANT AN UNBALANCED DIET DOMINATED BY BREAD AND MARGARINE AND TEA WITH CONDENSED MILK 
SO THAT HEALTH BEGAN TO DETERIORATE 
IT MEANT WHEN CLOTHES WORE OUT THEY COULD NOT BE REPLACED AND BREAKING A CUP COULD BE A MINOR DISASTER 
THE JARROW PETITION FOR WORK FOR THE THOUSANDS OF UNEMPLOYED IN PROBABLY THE HARDEST HIT TOWN 
IS BEING CARRIED TO LONDON BY THE TWO HUNDRED MEMBERS OF THE JARROW CRUSADE 
THE JARROW MARCH WAS ONLY ONE OF MANY HUNGER MARCHES 
BUT THE ONLY ONE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD ALLOW TO BE FILMED 
LONDON AT LAST 
THE JARROW CRUSADERS MUST BE GLAD TO HAVE REACHED THE END OF THEIR THREE HUNDRED MILE TREK 
OTHER MUCH LARGER MARCHES ORGANISED BY COMMUNISTS AND SOCIALISTS WERE VIOLENTLY BROKEN UP 
THE DEMONSTRATION HAS BEEN MOST ORDERLY THEY'RE OUT TO PETITION TO AID THEIR TOWN A WORTHY ONE 
SO HERE'S THE VERY BEST OF LUCK 
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED 
MANY FACTORIES WERE OLD FASHIONED AND NEEDED NEW MACHINERY 
BUT THERE WAS NO MONEY 
OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE JAPAN THE U. S. A. AND INDIA 
HAD TAKEN OVER BRITAIN'S EXPORT MARKETS 
OLD INDUSTRIES LIKE COAL STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING WERE WORST AFFECTED 
THESE WERE BASED 
IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND CENTRAL SCOTLAND AND SOUTH WALES 
THEY'D BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR BRITAIN'S SUCCESS 
DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
BUT NOW THEY WERE OUT OF DATE OTHER COUNTRIES OVERTOOK THEM 
ONE OF THE WORST PLACES TO SUFFER WAS JARROW 
FIVE OUT OF SIX PEOPLE DEPENDED ON PALMER'S SHIPYARD TO EARN A LIVING 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR IT WAS CLOSED TWO YEARS LATER 
THE PEOPLE OF JARROW ORGANISED A MARCH TO LONDON 
BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT 
IF PEOPLE WERE UNEMPLOYED FOR MORE THAN A YEAR 
THEY HAD TO FACE THE MEANS TEST 
BEFORE THEY WERE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE DOLE 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON WHY UNEMPLOYMENT WAS WORST IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE IN OTHER AREAS OF BRITAIN 
ALTHOUGH PEOPLE IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND EXPERIENCED POVERTY AND HARDSHIP DURING THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
IN OTHER AREAS OF BRITAIN THE PICTURE WAS VERY DIFFERENT 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND OUT WHY THEN PAUSE THE TAPE AND MAKE NOTES 
WE'RE IN THE MONEY WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WHAT IT TAKES TO GET ALONG 
WE'RE IN THE MONEY THE SKIES ARE SUNNY 
OLD MAN DEPRESSION YOU ARE THROUGH YOU DONE US WRONG 
WE NEVER SEE A HEADLINE BOUT THE BREADLINE TODAY 
AND WHEN WE SEE THE LANDLORD WE CAN LOOK THAT GUY IN THE EYE 
WE'RE IN THE MONEY COME ON MY HONEY 
LET'S SPEND IT SEND IT LEND IT ROLLING ALONG 
FOR MANY PEOPLE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES WERE AN UNPRECEDENTED ERA OF NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD 
IN PLACES LIKE THE SOUTH AND THE MIDLANDS THERE WERE NEW FACTORIES AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES 
STANDARDS OF LIVING WERE RISING FOR THOSE IN WORK BECAUSE OF FALLING PRICES 
FOR SOME PEOPLE THEN THIS WAS A PERIOD OF RISING CONSUMPTION AND THE FIRST STAGE OF AFFLUENCE 
BUT THIS SIDE OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES WAS EASILY OVERLOOKED AFTERWARDS 
WHEN PEOPLE ONLY SAW THE POWERFUL IMAGES OF THE HUNGER MARCHES AND THE DOLE QUEUES 
THIS SIDE OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THE SIDE OF BOOMING AFFLUENCE WAS EASILY FORGOTTEN 
FOR THOSE WITH MONEY THERE WAS THE CHANCE OF BUYING A SEMI DETACHED HOUSE FOR FOUR HUNDRED OR FIVE HUNDRED 
IN ONE OF THE NEW ESTATES BEING LAID OUT IN THE SUBURBS 
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING WE LONDONERS HAVE SAVED FOR 
A HOUSE IN THE SUBURBS A HOME OF OUR OWN A PLACE WHERE THE WIFE CAN BE MISTRESS IN HER OWN HOUSE 
A PLACE WHERE THE KIDS CAN RUN ABOUT IN SAFETY 
A QUIET PEACEFUL PLACE WHERE A MAN CAN REST AND FORGET HIS WORRIES FOR A WHILE 
THE THIRTIES SAW THE COMPLETION OF OVER THREE MILLION HOUSES MAINLY FOR PRIVATE SALE 
THREE BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS ONE OR TWO LIVING ROOMS DOWNSTAIRS 
AND EACH HOUSE HAS ITS OWN GARDEN 
MASSIVE SLUM CLEARANCE SCHEMES MOVED ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE INTO NEW LOCAL AUTHORITY HOMES 
ARCHITECTS OF THE MODERN MOVEMENT INTRODUCED BOLD NEW IDEAS FOR HOUSING 
THIS HOUSE WAS DESIGNED BY OLIVER HILL AS PART OF A NEW SEASIDE ESTATE AT FRINTON ON SEA 
NEW CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS MADE POSSIBLE EXCITING NEW DESIGNS 
WINDOWS COULD NOW BE MADE TO CURVE ROUND CORNERS AND RUN THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF A ROOM 
BECAUSE AIR AND LIGHT WERE NOW THOUGHT TO BE ESSENTIAL TO GOOD HEALTH 
THE HOUSE IS DESIGNED TO BE AS OPEN AND SPACIOUS AS POSSIBLE 
THE THIRTIES ALSO SAW THE ARRIVAL OF MANY LABOUR SAVING DEVICES 
HAPPY IN THE MORNING 
BECAUSE THE WATER'S HOT 
WE CAN BATH AN ARMY THE ASCOT DOES THE LOT 
HAPPY AFTER BREAKFAST 
BECAUSE THE WATER'S HOT 
DIRTY GREASY DISHES ARE LEFT WITHOUT A BLOT 
CLEANING HOUSE HAS NO MORE FEARS 
ASCOT'S WAITING THERE 
SAVING MONEY SIGHS AND TEARS AND ENDLESS WEAR AND TEAR 
HAPPY IN THE EVENING BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'VE GOT 
WATER WATER EVERYWHERE AND ALWAYS BOILING HOT 
THE ULTIMATE POSSESSION WAS A MOTOR CAR NOW AVAILABLE FOR AS LITTLE AS ONE HUNDRED 
SURELY THE CAR THAT TAKES US EVERYWHERE DESERVES THE CREDIT 
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT DEAR WE WERE VERY WISE WHEN WE DECIDED TO DEPEND ON AN AUSTIN 
OH I DO LIKE TO BE BESIDE THE SEASIDE 
PEOPLE ENJOYED INCREASED LEISURE TIME 
AND WITH PAID ANNUAL HOLIDAYS MANY WORKING PEOPLE WERE ENJOYING THEIR FIRST HOLIDAY AWAY FROM HOME 
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED 
IN THE SOUTH EAST AND MIDLANDS 
MANY PEOPLE HAD A MUCH HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING 
FACTORIES OPENED THAT MADE CARS BICYCLES AND ELECTRICAL GOODS 
THESE WERE CALLED THE NEW INDUSTRIES 
THEY MADE GOODS THAT MADE PEOPLE'S LIVES EASIER 
THEY USED THE ASSEMBLY LINE SO PRICES FELL 
BY THE MID NINETEEN THIRTIES MANY PRICES HAD FALLEN BY FORTY PER CENT 
THE NEW INDUSTRIES MEANT THAT UNEMPLOYMENT WAS LOW WAGES ROSE 
PEOPLE HAD MONEY TO SPEND AND BOUGHT CARS AND WENT TO THE CINEMA 
YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN 
BILLY BUTLIN OPENED HIS FIRST HOLIDAY CAMP 
THESE WERE ALL SIGNS THAT PEOPLE WERE BECOMING BETTER OFF 
HERE IS A TYPICAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT GET ON THIS TOPIC 
O. K. SO LET'S WORK THROUGH IT 
THE QUESTION ASKS WHAT EFFECTS SO TO GET GOOD MARKS 
TO GET THE HIGHEST MARKS 
STOP REWIND THE TAPE AND HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS SECTION 
THEN HAVE A GO AT THE QUESTION 
YOUR PLAN FOR THE ANSWER SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
THAT'S THE END OF THE WHOLE SECTION ON THE DEPRESSION 
WE NOW MOVE ON TO 
IN THIS SECTION ON THE HOME FRONT DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
WE'LL LOOK AT 
FIRST HOW DID THE GOVERNMENT TRY TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN 
THE GOVERNMENT REALISED 
THE WAR WAS GOING TO BE MORE DANGEROUS THAN EVER BEFORE 
PEOPLE COULD BE KILLED OR INJURED BY BOMBING 
AND MIGHT ALSO BE STARVED BY GERMAN BLOCKADE 
WATCH THE NEXT CLIP PAUSE THE TAPE 
AND MAKE NOTES ON THE EFFECT THE BLITZ AND EVACUATION HAD ON LIFE 
MEANWHILE THERE'S MORE MERRIMENT DOWN ON THE FARM HOW DO YOU LIKE COUNTRY LIFE 
OH IT'S WONDERFUL SIR AND YOU GEORGE 
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE WELL I'VE SEEN 
A RABBIT 
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT THEY'RE EVACUEES SELECT EVACUATION 
SEPTEMBER FIRST NINETEEN THIRTY NINE A MASS EVACUATION BEGAN FROM THE CITIES 
TO SAFETY ZONES THROUGHOUT BRITAIN 
THE RISK OF AIR RAIDS SEEMED SO GREAT 
PARENTS WERE ENCOURAGED TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN AWAY 
FOR THE DURATION OF THE WAR 
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE ALIVE TODAY WHO EXPERIENCED EVACUATION 
EITHER AS PARENTS FOSTER PARENTS OR CHILD EVACUEES 
IT WAS AN AGONISING SITUATION FOR PARENTS TO HAVE TO MAKE 
WHETHER TO EXPOSE THEIR CHILDREN TO THE DANGERS OF BEING BURNED ALIVE OR BLOWN TO PIECES BY BOMBS 
OR WHETHER THEY WOULD TO ENTRUST THEM TO STRANGERS TO LET THEM OUT INTO THE UNKNOWN AN AWFUL DECISION 
THEY DON'T LOOK TOO WORRIED 
TO ENCOURAGE EVACUATION THE NEWSREELS SHOWED IT AS AN ADVENTURE 
MOST OF THE CHILDREN HAVE GONE OFF CHEERFULLY FOR THEM 
THE PROCEDURE SEEMS TO HOLD NO TERRORS AND IS EVEN REGARDED AS A HOLIDAY 
MAYBE IT WAS FOR SOME 
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU GOT THERE 
WHAT FOLLOWED WAS REALLY LIKE AN AUCTION SALE PEOPLE LOOKED US OVER 
AND CHOSE CHILDREN 
IT WAS WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH THIS NICE LADY 
OR HERE'S A COUPLE WHO'RE LOOKING FOR A NICE LITTLE GIRL 
EVERYTHING DEPENDED ON WHO YOUR FOSTER PARENTS WERE 
HAD THEY BEEN FORCED TO TAKE YOU ON OR WAS IT GENUINE GOODWILL 
DID THEY REALLY WANT TO LOOK AFTER YOU OR DID THEY JUST WANT A CHEAP MAID OR FARMHAND 
NO REAL EFFORT WAS MADE TO MATCH EVACUEES WITH THEIR HOSTS AND THERE WERE MISUNDERSTANDINGS 
ALL LONDON TEACHERS RESENTED THE SMUG ASSUMPTION MADE BY MANY VILLAGERS 
THAT EVERY CHILD WHO CAME FROM LONDON MUST COME FROM A SLUM 
AND HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED BY ITS PARENTS AND THAT THEY WERE DIRTY 
ON THE FIRST EVENING MY NEW FOSTER MOTHER SAID TO ME ARE YOU CHURCH OR CHAPEL 
VERY CAUTIOUSLY I SAID WHICH ARE YOU SHE SAID WE'RE CHURCH 
AND SO FROM THEN ON I WAS CHURCH TOO 
THE PENALTY FOR THIS PIECE OF TREACHERY 
WAS THAT I HAD TO LISTEN TO A STREAM OF ANTI SEMITISM FROM THESE PEOPLE 
ABOUT THOSE FILTHY JEWS DOWN THE ROAD 
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN 
SHE WAS JEWISH BUT SHE HID THIS TO FIT INTO A NEW INTOLERANT HOUSEHOLD RIGHT 
HOW ELSE DID EVACUATION AFFECT PEOPLE 
FOR SOME IT WAS A CHANCE TO DISCOVER THE COUNTRYSIDE AND MAKE FRIENDS FOR LIFE 
OTHERS FOUND IT MORE DIFFICULT 
BUT BY BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER OF VERY DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS 
SOCIETY WAS FACING UP TO DIVISIONS SO OFTEN IGNORED 
I SUPPOSE WE SHALL ALL REMEMBER THE EMOTIONS OF THIS HEADY SUMMER 
WHAT OUR NEW PRIME MINISTER CALLED OUR DARKEST HOUR 
WHEN IT SEEMED THAT ANY DAY WE MIGHT BE INVADED BY THE NAZIS 
BUT WE WEREN'T DOWNHEARTED WE PATROLLED AND WAITED 
WE WORKED AND WAITED WAITED FOR THE TERROR WE KNEW WAS COMING 
THEN IT CAME 
THIS WAS THE SOUND THAT BECAME PART OF THE DAILY LIFE OF EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD IN BRITAIN 
WHAT'S GOING ON THE GERMAN BOMBING OF BRITISH CITIES LATER CALLED THE BLITZ SELECT 
THE BOMBING OF LONDON BEGAN AT FIVE P. M. ON SEPTEMBER SEVENTH NINETEEN FORTY 
FOR TWELVE HOURS INCENDIARIES AND HIGH EXPLOSIVES RAINED DOWN 
IN AN ATTEMPT TO BREAK BRITISH MORALE THOUSANDS OF HOMES WERE DESTROYED ON THAT FIRST NIGHT 
FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY PEOPLE DIED ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED 
SO HOW DID PEOPLE COPE 
EAST LONDON PAUSED TO LICK ITS WOUNDS FOR A MOMENT YESTERDAY 
AFTER HITLER'S NIGHT OF TERROR BUT IT CARRIED ON REGARDLESS 
DURING A FIVE HOUR TOUR OF THE BOMBED AREA I MET ONLY ONE DISGRUNTLED PERSON 
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED 
IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN THIRTY NINE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT EXPECTED THE WORST 
NEARLY ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED 
FROM BIG CITIES AND STRICT REGULATIONS CAME INTO FORCE 
YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED REGULATIONS 
TO TRY TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM BOMBING 
EVERYONE HAD TO CARRY A GAS MASK AT ALL TIMES 
FILMS WERE MADE WARNING PEOPLE OF THE DANGERS OF BOMBING 
THERE WERE PRACTICE AIR RAIDS SO PEOPLE KNEW WHERE SHELTERS WERE 
BUT FOR SIX MONTHS NOTHING HAPPENED 
AND UNTIL SEPTEMBER NINETEEN FORTY NO BOMBS WERE DROPPED ON BRITISH CITIES 
THEN THE BLITZ BEGAN 
FROM SEPTEMBER TILL NOVEMBER 
BRITAIN WAS BOMBED REGULARLY BY THE GERMAN AIR FORCE 
AT THE SAME TIME THE GERMANS TRIED TO STARVE BRITAIN OUT 
BY SINKING SHIPS CARRYING SUPPLIES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC 
U. BOATS ATTACKED THE CONVOYS 
THAT WERE BRING FOOD AND WAR MATERIALS FROM THE U. S. A. 
BY NINETEEN FORTY ONE THE SITUATION WAS DESPERATE 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON EVACUATION AND THE BLITZ 
SO HOW DID THE GOVERNMENT TRY TO OVERCOME FOOD SHORTAGES 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP AND LOOK FOR THE WAYS 
THE GOVERNMENT TRIED TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE HAD ENOUGH TO EAT 
THEN PAUSE THE TAPE AND MAKE NOTES 
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO SEE THE NEWSREELS REGULARLY 
HERE'S ONE STORY THAT'S BECOMING A SERIAL 
THE STORY OF THE BRITISH CONVOYS THAT TRUDGE THROUGH THE SEAS 
LASHED BY BOMBS TO BRING US VITAL FOOD AND RAW MATERIALS 
YET THEIR SELFLESS WORK IS BEING UNDERMINED BY THE BLACK MARKETERS 
HERE'S LORD WOOLTON MINISTER FOR FOOD 
THERE MUST BE NO DIRTY FINGERS IN THE PEOPLE'S FOOD 
THAT'S RIGHT FOOD CHEATS ARE THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE 
ARE YOU LACKING COUPONS FOR NEW CLOTHES 
WHY NOT FORM A MAKE DO AND MEND GROUP WITH YOUR FRIENDS 
THEN YOU CAN ALL HELP EACH OTHER 
AND REMEMBER OUR HOUSEHOLD HINTS STOP THAT TAP FROM DRIPPING 
DON'T WASTE GAS BY LEAVING THE KETTLE BOILING 
AND DON'T CUT THE STRING UNTIE THE KNOT AND DON'T THROW IT AWAY 
DID THEY REALLY SAVE BITS OF STRING 
IT WAS NO JOKE GERMAN BLOCKADES AND WAR PRODUCTION IN THE FACTORIES 
MEANT SHORTAGES OF NECESSITIES CLOTHES FUEL FOOD 
PEOPLE WERE URGED TO MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY AVAILABLE RESOURCE 
DO YOU LIKE STANDING IN A QUEUE FOR YOUR VEGETABLES 
OR DO YOU THINK IT'S TIRING DO YOU EVER FIND YOUR WAIT WAS USELESS 
THAT SUPPLIES HAVE RUN OUT BEFORE YOUR TURN COMES 
IT'S NOT THE GREENGROCER'S FAULT IT'S UP TO YOU 
DIG FOR VICTORY 
COMMON LAND PRIVATE GARDENS EVEN GOLF COURSES 
EVERY AVAILABLE SPACE HAD TO BE USED TO GROW FOOD THEN CAME STEP TWO 
MAKING THE MOST NUTRITIOUS USE OF WHAT YOU'D GROWN 
COOK FOR TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES IN A CUP OF WATER 
ARTHUR I CAN'T GET IN A CUP 
NOT YOU PUT THE CABBAGE IN THE CUP OF WATER 
I CAN'T THE GET CABBAGE IN THE CUP NO PUT THE CABBAGE AND THE CUP OF WATER IN THE SAUCEPAN 
BUT MANY FOODS COULD ONLY BE BOUGHT IN SHOPS 
SHORTAGES THREATENED RISING PRICES THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY UNFAIR 
THE RICH COULD BUY WHAT THEY NEEDED THE POOR WOULD GET NOTHING 
SO THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED THE RATION BOOK 
WHICH CONTROLLED WHAT EACH INDIVIDUAL COULD BUY 
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED 
TO TRY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE IN BRITAIN HAD ENOUGH TO EAT 
EVERYONE WAS ISSUED WITH A RATION BOOK 
AND HAD TO REGISTER WITH A GROCER AND A BUTCHER 
THE RATION COUPONS HAD TO BE EXCHANGED FOR FOOD EVERY WEEK 
MEAT CHEESE SUGAR FAT AND SWEETS WERE RATIONED 
LORD WOOLTON THE MINISTER FOR FOOD 
ENCOURAGED PEOPLE NOT TO WASTE ANYTHING 
UNLESS IT WAS COMPLETELY USELESS 
MAKE DO AND MEND WAS A POPULAR SLOGAN 
THIS MEANT CARRY ON REPAIRING SOMETHING FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON FOOD SHORTAGES 
WITH SO MANY MEN AWAY IN THE ARMED FORCES 
WOMEN HAD TO TAKE OVER MANY JOBS 
WATCH THE CLIP THEN PAUSE THE TAPE 
AND MAKE NOTES ON WHAT WOMEN DID DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
WE EVEN MOBILISED OUR WOMEN SHOULD WE LET THE SCOURGE OF UNEMPLOYMENT RETURN 
WAS WOMEN WORKING SO UNUSUAL 
WORK HAD BEEN AVAILABLE FOR SINGLE WOMEN 
MOSTLY IN THE TEXTILE INDUSTRIES CLERICAL WORK AND DOMESTIC SERVICE 
LOW STATUS JOBS FOR HALF THE EQUIVALENT MALE WAGE 
BUT EVEN THAT STOPPED ON MARRIAGE FROM THEN ON WORK MEANT HOUSEWORK 
THE WAR CHANGED ALL THAT 
THE CALL IS SOUNDED AND WOMEN FALL IN FOR SERVICE IN THEIR COUNTRY'S CAUSE 
KHAKI UNIFORM REPLACES FASHION 
FOR IN THE AUXILIARY TERRITORIAL SERVICE WOMEN UNDERGO MILITARY TRAINING 
AND UNDERTAKE TASKS WHICH WILL RELIEVE MEN FOR FIGHTING 
BY NINETEEN FORTY THREE BRITAIN HAD CONSCRIPTED ALL WOMEN UP TO THE AGE OF FIFTY 
TO WORK IN DEFENCE ON THE LAND OR IN THE FACTORIES 
WOMEN WERE TO COME TO THE NATION'S RESCUE 
AND TRADITIONAL VALUES HAD TO BE SET ASIDE 
WOMEN ARE NO USE NO GOOD TELLING ME DIFFERENT 
WHAT'S THAT A WOMAN SIR 
SOON WOMEN WERE PROVING THEMSELVES AS GOOD AS MEN 
EVEN IN ENGINEERING AND HEAVY INDUSTRY 
THEY WERE PORTRAYED AS THE HEROINES OF THE HOME FRONT 
THEY WORKED LONG HOURS UNDER THE CONSTANT THREAT OF BOMBING 
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED 
WOMEN SOON FOUND THEMSELVES WORKING IN ALL KINDS OF INDUSTRIES 
THEY DID MOST OF THE WORK IN MUNITIONS FACTORIES 
THEY BUILT TANKS AND AIRCRAFT 
AND EVEN TRAINED AS PILOTS TO DELIVER AIRCRAFT TO AIRFIELDS 
IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE SINGLE WOMEN WERE CONSCRIPTED INTO THE ARMED FORCES 
IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE MARRIED WOMEN WERE ALSO CONSCRIPTED 
THEY TOOK OVER JOBS FROM MEN THAT DIDN'T INVOLVE FIGHTING 
YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW 
THAT WOMEN PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN THE VOLUNTARY SERVICES 
THEY WORKED AS FIRE WATCHERS AIR RAID WARDENS 
AND IN THE WOMEN'S VOLUNTARY SERVICE 
LOOKED AFTER PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN HURT OR MADE HOMELESS IN AIR RAIDS 
AT THIS TIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY FOR MORALE TO HAVE DROPPED 
THIS WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THE CLIP AND IS OFTEN IGNORED IN HISTORY BOOKS 
HERE IS A TYPICAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT GET ON THIS TOPIC 
LET'S WORK THROUGH IT 
STOP REWIND THE TAPE AND HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS WHOLE SECTION 
AND THEN HAVE A GO AT THE QUESTION 
HOW DID YOU GET ON 
YOUR PLAN SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
THAT'S THE END OF THE WHOLE OF THE SECTION 
ON THE HOME FRONT NINETEEN THIRTY NINE TO NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
IN THIS SECTION WE'LL LOOK AT 
AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR LLOYD GEORGE HAD WANTED TO CREATE A HOME FIT FOR HEROES 
BUT THE GOVERNMENT WAS IN DEBT AFTER THE WAR AND THE SITUATION GREW WORSE DURING THE DEPRESSION 
WATCH THE NEXT CLIP THEN PAUSE THE TAPE 
AND MAKE NOTES OF WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE IN BRITAIN IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BETWEEN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE AND NINETEEN THIRTY TWO WAS NEARLY THIRTY PER CENT 
THE CENTRAL BELT OF SCOTLAND WAS BADLY AFFECTED MANY OF THE UNEMPLOYED WERE SKILLED WORKERS 
I REMEMBER AT ONE POINT THERE WAS FOUR MEN IN THE STREET WORKING 
MY FATHER WAS ONE NONE WERE WORKING AT THEIR TRADE 
NOW WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WAS THEY WALKED THE STREETS IDLE 
AND THEY USED TO GO DOWN EVERY DAY TO LEITH DOCKS IT WAS SIR HENRY ROBBS 
AND SEE IF THERE WAS ANY WORK 
AND THERE WOULD MAYBE BE QUITE A CROWD OF THEM STANDING AND IT ALL DEPENDED HOW THE GAFFER FELT 
AND HE WOULD JUST LOOK AT THEM AND SAY YOU YOU YOU AND YOU AND MAYBE ONLY TAKE FOUR 
THEY WOULD GET MAYBE A FORTNIGHT'S WORK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AS MORE PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS THE COST OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT SUPPORT REACHED CRISIS POINT 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY ONE THE GOVERNMENT CUT THE DOLE BY TEN PER CENT 
THEY MADE EVERYONE CLAIMING IT TAKE A MEANS TEST 
IT MADE LIFE EVEN HARDER FOR MANY FAMILIES 
BY INVESTIGATING HOUSEHOLDS TO FIND OUT IF ANYONE WAS EARNING MONEY 
THE INSPECTORS WOULD COME AND IF YOU HAD ANYTHING IN YOUR HOUSE THAT WAS OF ANY VALUE 
IF YOU HAD AN ORNAMENT THAT YOU COULD SELL YOU HAD TO SELL IT 
SOME OF THE UNEMPLOYED DEVOTED THEIR TIME TO PROTESTS 
THE HUNGER MARCHES AS THEY WERE CALLED BEGAN IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO AND CONTINUED FOR SIXTEEN YEARS 
I WENT IN THEM THE CHILDREN WENT WITH THEIR PARENTS 
AND SHOUTING AND CARRYING ON 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE UNEMPLOYMENT IN BRITAIN REACHED THREE MILLION 
IN DUNDEE UNEMPLOYED WORKERS CLASHED WITH THE POLICE AND THERE WAS SERIOUS RIOTING IN GLASGOW 
IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES ALMOST HALF A MILLION PEOPLE EMIGRATED TO PLACES LIKE AMERICA TO ESCAPE THE POVERTY 
SO HOW DID YOU GET ON YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED 
DURING THE NINETEEN THIRTIES MANY PEOPLE SUFFERED GREAT HARDSHIP 
THE NATIONAL INSURANCE ACTS APPLIED TO THE WORKER AND NOT HIS FAMILY 
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT STOPPED AFTER TWELVE MONTHS 
FAMILIES HAD TO APPLY FOR THE DOLE AND FACE THE MEANS TEST 
THIS MEANT HAVING AN INSPECTOR GO THROUGH THE HOUSE AND BELONGINGS 
FAMILIES COULD BE FORCED TO SELL PROPERTY BEFORE RECEIVING HELP 
WIVES AND CHILDREN HAD TO PAY FOR VISITS TO THE DOCTOR 
AND FOR ANY MEDICINES PRESCRIBED 
MANY WOMEN WENT WITHOUT TO ENSURE THEIR CHILDREN WERE LOOKED AFTER 
MANY POLITICIANS DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY 
TO LOOK AFTER ALL OF THE PEOPLE 
THEY BELIEVED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPROVE THE NATION'S HEALTH 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON BRITAIN IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR THE GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO CONTROL MANY ASPECTS OF EVERYDAY LIFE 
IT WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THIS IN PEACE TIME BUT WAR DEMANDED IT 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP THEN PAUSE THE TAPE 
AND MAKE NOTES ON WHY ATTITUDES BEGAN TO CHANGE DURING THE WAR 
MANY SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT IN THE WAR WERE THE SAME MEN WHO HAD STOOD IN THE DOLE QUEUES OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
AND FACED THE HUMILIATION OF THE MEANS TEST 
THEY REMEMBERED THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THEIR FATHERS WHO HAD FOUGHT IN WWI FOR A LAND FIT FOR HEROES 
AND WERE DETERMINED THIS TIME PROMISES WOULD BE DELIVERED 
ON THE HOME FRONT THE WAR MADE A BIG IMPACT 
CALLING ALL WORKERS 
IN INDUSTRIES SUPPORTING THE WAR THERE WAS A NEW ATMOSPHERE OF CO OPERATION AND CONSIDERATION 
THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR CONFLICT THAT MIGHT THREATEN PRODUCTION 
A HAPPY HEALTHY WORKFORCE WAS IMPORTANT 
MUSIC WHILE YOU WORK THIS MORNING 
THE B. B. C. TRANSMITTED PROGRAMMES TO BRIGHTEN UP THE WORKING DAY CRECHES WERE OPENED FOR WORKING MOTHERS 
MANAGEMENT AND WORKERS HAD MEETINGS TO IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS 
STANDARDS OF HEALTH AND WELFARE WERE RAISED EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO RAISE SPIRITS WAS DONE 
NEW CANTEENS BROUGHT HOT LUNCHES AND SOMETIMES MORALE BOOSTING CONCERTS 
ROUND THE BACK OF THE ARCHES BY FLANAGAN AND ALLEN 
THE WAR BROKE DOWN CLASS BARRIERS 
IN ANY OFFICE SUCH AS OURS 
BESIDES THE DAY'S WORK WE'D FIRE WATCH AT NIGHT 
THE MANAGING DIRECTOR WOULD FIRE WATCH WITH THE OFFICE BOY AND THE JUNIOR TYPIST FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE 
AND THEN THEY'D ALL DOSS DOWN IN GREAT DISCOMFORT 
IN ONE OF THE OFFICES WITH RUGS THAT WERE PROVIDED FOR THE PURPOSE 
SO EVERYBODY HAD TO MUCK IN 
DURING THE WAR WE ALL TALKED TO ANYONE WE FOUND OURSELVES WITH 
IF YOU WERE IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE YOU TALKED TO THE OTHER PEOPLE IF YOU WERE ON A BENCH SAME THING 
IN BUSES WE ALL TALKED IT WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE 
THE AIR RAID SHELTERS ESPECIALLY ENCOURAGED THIS COMMUNITY SPIRIT 
WHAT SHALL WE HAVE DOWN A. T. THE COME ON THEN 
COME COME COME AND MAKE EYES AT ME 
DOWN AT THE OLD BULL AND BUSH 
HERE DIFFERENCES OF BACKGROUND WERE FORGOTTEN AND FRIENDSHIPS MADE 
TO ESCAPE THE BOMBING CHILDREN WERE EVACUATED FROM THE TOWNS THIS LET PEOPLE SEE HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVED 
MIDDLE CLASS COUNTRY LADIES WERE SHOCKED WHEN THEY MET SOME OF THESE CHILDREN 
THOSE COMING FROM THE SLUMS WERE OFTEN IN AN APPALLING PHYSICAL CONDITION 
UNDERNOURISHED BADLY CLOTHED AND SUFFERING FROM SKIN INFECTIONS 
GUILT AND SHAME LED TO PROMISES OF FUTURE ACTION 
YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOTTED 
MEMORIES OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES WERE IMPORTANT 
AFTER THE SACRIFICES DURING THE WAR 
THEY WANTED A BETTER LIFE FOR BRITISH PEOPLE WHEN IT ENDED 
PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT CLASSES MIXED MUCH MORE DURING THE WAR 
THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT EACH OTHERS LIVES THIS MADE PEOPLE CLOSE 
EVACUATION SHOWED JUST HOW BAD A STATE SOME CHILDREN WERE IN 
SOME FAMILIES WERE HORRIFIED WHEN THEY RECEIVED EVACUEES 
THEY HAD SKIN DISEASES AND WERE MALNOURISHED 
IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE 
PUBLISHED A REPORT WHICH DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM 
THIS FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO ACT 
RATIONING WAS INTRODUCED TO TRY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE IN BRITAIN HAD ENOUGH TO EAT 
IT MEANT PEOPLE ATE LESS MEAT AND FAT AND INSTEAD HAD MORE VEGETABLES AND POTATOES 
THE RESULT WAS THAT PEOPLE BECAME FAR HEALTHIER 
PREGNANT WOMEN ALSO RECEIVED SPECIAL TREATMENT 
THIS PROVED PEOPLE COULD BE MADE HEALTHIER 
HOUSING WAS BADLY DAMAGED BY BOMBING AND WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED AFTER THE WAR 
IT SOON BECAME CLEAR THAT AFTER ALL THE SACRIFICES PEOPLE HAD MADE DURING THE WAR 
SOMETHING BETTER HAD TO COME OUT OF IT IT WAS THIS FEELING THAT LED TO THE IDEA OF THE WELFARE STATE 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON THE IMPACT OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE THE GOVERNMENT SET UP A COMMISSION TO LOOK INTO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE AFTER THE WAR 
WILLIAM BEVERIDGE WAS IN CHARGE IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO HE PRODUCED THE BEVERIDGE REPORT 
WATCH THIS CLIP AND NOTE DOWN WHAT WAS IN THE BEVERIDGE REPORT 
WHAT WERE THE EFFECTS OF WAR ON THE BRITISH PEOPLE 
DURING THE WAR CIVIL SERVANT SIR WILLIAM BEVERIDGE PRODUCED A REPORT 
IN WHICH HE LAID OUT HIS PLAN FOR A BETTER BRITAIN 
THIS CARTOON SHOWS THE FIVE GIANTS BEVERIDGE THOUGHT HAD TO BE KILLED 
WANT MUST NOT BE KNOWN AGAIN 
IDLENESS THERE MUST BE NO MASS UNEMPLOYMENT A GIANT EVIL OF ONLY YESTERDAY 
IGNORANCE NO DEMOCRACY CAN NOWADAYS AFFORD 
DISEASE MUST BE OVERTHROWN 
THE VOLUNTARY HOSPITAL AND THE NURSING HOME ARE NOT ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN THIS NATION'S HEALTH 
WE ARE NOT FIGHTING TO PRESERVE SLUMS WHICH BREED DISEASE JUST AS SWAMPS BREED MALARIA 
NO MORE GENERATIONS MUST BE STUNTED IN SQUALOR 
YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOTTED 
BEVERIDGE RECOMMENDED THAT A WELFARE STATE SHOULD BE SET UP 
THE STATE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WELFARE OF ITS PEOPLE 
IT SHOULD SUPPORT THEM WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG OLD OR COULDN'T WORK 
AND SHOULD PROVIDE MEDICAL TREATMENT WHEN NEEDED 
BEVERIDGE LISTED FIVE GIANT EVILS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO TACKLE 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ENSURE PEOPLE DIDN'T SUFFER FROM ANY OF THESE 
BEVERIDGE'S PLAN WAS THAT STATE HELP SHOULD RUN FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE 
AS SOON AS A BABY WAS BORN THERE SHOULD BE HELP THIS SHOULD LAST UNTIL THE PERSON WAS BURIED 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON BEVERIDGE AND THE FIVE GIANTS 
IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE THE LABOUR PARTY WON THE GENERAL ELECTION AND BEGAN TO PUT THE BEVERIDGE REPORT INTO PRACTICE 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP 
AND NOTE DOWN ALL THE CHANGES THAT THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT MADE IN THE YEARS FROM NINETEEN FORTY FIVE TO NINETEEN FIFTY 
TACKLING THE GIANT OF WANT WAS BEVERIDGE'S OWN SPECIFIC TASK 
HE PROPOSED INSURANCE BENEFITS TO RID THE UNEMPLOYED THE SICK AND THE OLD FROM THE FEAR OF POVERTY 
AND A FAMILY ALLOWANCE TO HELP PARENTS PAY FOR CHILDREN 
SIR WILLIAM YOU'VE THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING 
FAMILY ALLOWANCE BECAME LAW IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
THERE'S SHOES FOR BETTY AND A SUIT FOR GEORGE I'M NOT MADE OF MONEY 
WAIT I'VE JUST READ ABOUT FAMILY ALLOWANCES WE CAN GET TEN SHILLINGS A WEEK 
THE FOLLOWING YEAR NATIONAL INSURANCE WAS MADE LAW 
HOW OLD ARE YOU PENSIONS THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED A BETTER DEAL THAN BEVERIDGE HAD SUGGESTED 
ATCHOO SICKNESS BENEFIT THIS WENT UP BY EIGHT SHILLINGS A WEEK 
IF YOU ARE ILL TO CLAIM SICKNESS BENEFIT YOU MUST GET A CERTIFICATE FROM YOUR DOCTOR 
THE SCHEME CAME INTO OPERATION IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT ON THE SAME DATE AS THE START OF THE ATTACK ON DISEASE 
ON JULY FIFTH THE NEW NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE STARTS 
THIS TRANSFORMED HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE LOVED IT 
THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY THRILLED 
TO FIND THAT THEY COULD GO TO A DOCTOR AND GET FREE THE EXPERT ADVICE THEY NEEDED 
A CONSULTANT'S ADVICE IF THEY NEEDED IT HOSPITAL TREATMENT AND THEY PAID NOTHING WHILE THEY WERE SICK 
LET'S HAVE A PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION 
OFF YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR YOU HAVE SOME UNUSUAL ILLNESS WHICH CAN'T BE DIAGNOSED 
HE'LL NO DOUBT WISH YOU TO SEE A SPECIALIST IN HOSPITAL YOU'LL BE UNDER OBSERVATION 
THIS WILL INCLUDE X. RAY IF NECESSARY 
PRIOR TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE N. H. S. 
FREE MEDICAL TREATMENT WAS AVAILABLE TO INSURED WORKERS BUT NOT THEIR FAMILY DOCTORS HAD TO BE PAID FOR 
YOU WERE AWARE OF CAN'T GO TO THE DOCTOR IT COSTS FIVE SHILLINGS 
WHEN YOU WENT YOU HAD TO HAVE THE FIVE SHILLINGS IN YOUR HAND YOU COULDN'T JUST GO 
YOU HAD TO HAVE IT OR THEY WOULDN'T TREAT YOU IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING SO POOR PEOPLE DIDN'T GO AT ALL 
MY MOTHER SHE HAD HAD THIS TROUBLE SHE WAS LOSING BLOOD AND I SAID ABOUT THE DOCTOR 
NO NO SHE SAID IT'S JUST THE CHANGE OF LIFE IT'S JUST NORMAL 
AND SHE WOULDN'T GO TO THE DOCTOR 
NO IT'S QUITE NATURAL ALL WOMEN GO THROUGH THIS I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANYTHING TO IT 
AND WHEN SHE FINALLY DID GO TO THE DOCTOR I THINK SHE HAD A FLOODING 
IT WAS TOO LATE THE CANCER HAD SPREAD RIGHT THROUGH HER BODY AT FORTY TWO YEARS OF AGE 
THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE DIDN'T JUST MAKE DOCTORS AVAILABLE TO ALL 
OTHER FORMS OF MEDICAL CARE LIKE DENTISTS AND OPTICIANS WERE PART OF THE SERVICE 
EVERYBODY COULD GET GLASSES AND DENTURES FOR NOTHING 
MY MOTHER AND DAD HAD PROBLEMS WITH THEIR TEETH FOR AGES THEY WERE THE FIRST AT THE DENTIST 
AS SOON AS THEY OPENED THEY WERE THERE 
INSTEAD OF HAVING A FEW TEETH OUT THEY HAD THEM ALL OUT 
AND FREE DENTURES THEY THOUGHT IT WAS WONDERFUL 
THERE WAS A HUGE DEMAND FOR ALL THE N. H. S. SERVICES 
DENTISTS DOCTORS AND OPTICIANS WERE OVERWHELMED WITH PEOPLE 
SOME SAW THIS AS A SYMPTOM OF OFFERING SOMETHING FOR NOTHING 
OTHERS THAT LACK OF MONEY HAD STOPPED DEMAND FOR TREATMENT BEFORE 
IT MEANT THE COSTS OF THE N. H. S. 
WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN EXPECTED AND THREATENED THE CONTINUATION OF A TOTALLY FREE SERVICE 
OF ALL THE GIANTS IDLENESS LINGERED MOST VIVIDLY IN THE MEMORIES OF THOSE WHO LIVED THROUGH THE THIRTIES 
THE YEARS OF MASS UNEMPLOYMENT AND DEPRESSION 
HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT WAS A SCOURGE 
BUT AS BEVERIDGE WARNED IT COULD'VE CAUSED THE COLLAPSE OF HIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME 
A WELFARE SYSTEM DIDN'T COME FREE BRITAIN COULD ONLY AFFORD ONE IF ITS PEOPLE WERE IN WORK 
CREATING WEALTH SO THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO HAVE ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT ENSURED FULL EMPLOYMENT 
THIS GRAPH OF UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS BETWEEN NINETEEN THIRTY ONE AND NINETEEN FIFTY ONE 
SHOWS HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY WERE IN ACHIEVING THAT 
BEFORE THE WAR UNEMPLOYMENT RANGED FROM ONE MILLION TO ALMOST THREE MILLION 
AFTER THE WAR IT NEVER ROSE ABOVE HALF A MILLION 
THE POST WAR LABOUR GOVERNMENT ATTACKED THE FIVE GIANTS 
AND IN DOING SO ESTABLISHED THE WELFARE STATE IN BRITAIN WITH THE N. H. S. AS ITS CROWNING GLORY 
YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOTTED 
THE N. H. S. CAME INTO BEING IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT 
ALL THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN COULD RECEIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT FREE OF CHARGE FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THE NATIONAL INSURANCE ACT CAME INTO EFFECT AT THE SAME TIME 
ALL WORKERS WERE NOW COVERED AS WERE THEIR FAMILIES 
BOTH SCHEMES WERE PAID FOR BY NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS 
FURTHER EXPENSES WERE COVERED BY THE STATE 
THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT ALSO PROVIDED FAMILY ALLOWANCES 
WEEKLY PAYMENTS TO HELP WITH CHILDREN'S UPBRINGING 
THERE WAS NO PAYMENT FOR THE FIRST CHILD ONLY THE SECOND AND THIRD NOW THIS IS CALLED CHILD BENEFIT 
YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT NATIONAL ASSISTANCE COVERED ANYBODY WHO WAS NOT ENTITLED TO NATIONAL INSURANCE 
PERHAPS PEOPLE WHO WERE TOO OLD TO WORK 
THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT BEGAN A BIG HOUSING PROGRAMME 
AND BUILT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW HOUSES TO REPLACE AREAS THAT HAD BEEN DESTROYED DURING THE WAR 
HERE'S A TYPICAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT GET ON THIS TOPIC 
O. K. SO LET'S WORK THROUGH IT 
THIS QUESTION IS ASKING TO EXPLAIN A WELFARE STATE WAS INTRODUCED 
TO GET THE BEST MARKS SORT THE REASONS INTO THE CORRECT ORDER AND EXPLAIN HOW ONE LED TO ANOTHER 
STOP REWIND THE TAPE HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS WHOLE SECTION 
THEN HAVE A GO 
YOUR PLAN SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
THAT'S THE END OF SECTION ON THE WELFARE STATE 
THAT'S THE END OF THIS PROGRAMME THE OTHER TWO HISTORY PROGRAMMES ARE 
THERE'S MORE INFORMATION IN THE BITESIZE BOOKS AND ON THE WEBSITE
