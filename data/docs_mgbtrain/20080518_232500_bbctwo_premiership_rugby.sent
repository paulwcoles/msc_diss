THE MIDDLE OF MAY BUT THERE ARE 
STILL UP THREE WEEKS TO GO IN THE 
DOMESTIC RUGBY SEASON TODAY WE 
HAD THEIR SEMI FINALS OF THE 
GUINNESS PREMIERSHIP LAWRENCE 
DALLAGLIO'S LAST HOME GAME AGAINST 
A SIDE WHO HAVE PLAYED SOME 
SPECTACULAR RUGBY ALL SEASON AND HE 
WANTED REVENGE IN THIS END OF 
SEASON GRAND FINAL FOSTER 
LEICESTER IS A REPEAT OF LAST 
YEAR'S SEMI FINAL GLOUCESTER 
LEICESTER THEIR COACH'S JOB COULD 
HAVE DEPENDED ON THIS GAME ALSO 
THIS WEEK MARTIN JOHNSON'S FIRST 
ENGLAND SQUAD ANOTHER BIG MAN WAS 
PUT INTO THE REJECT BIN 
RYAN ECHO LOW AMONGST THOSE WHO 
HAVE BEEN DUMPED PERHAPS 
SURPRISINGLY PLENTY TO TALK ABOUT 
BUT WE WILL FOCUS ON THESE TWO 
SEMI FINALS BY NICOLE LOW THE 
GENERAL STANDARD HAS GONE UP A 
NOTCH OR TWO VAINIKOLO 
THERE WAS ONE LAST CHANCE FOR THE 
CROWD AT WASPS TO SEE SOMEONE WHO 
WAS GREAT FOR THEIR SIDE ON 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT LAWRENCE DALLAGLIO 
RECEIVED A SPECIAL PRESENTATION FOR 
HIS EIGHTEEN SEASONS WITH THE CLUB THE 
NEXT GENERATION KNOW ONLY TOO WELL 
HOW MUCH THEY OWED THE FORMER 
ENGLAND CAPTAIN AND HOW MUCH HE 
WANTED TO GO OUT ON A HIGH 
HE IS 
GOING TO BE UP FOR IT EVERYONE IS 
GOING TO SEND HIM A GOOD FAREWELL 
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN SUCH A GOOD 
AMBASSADOR FOR THE CLUB 
IT WAS A 
VERY STRESSFUL WEEK FOUGHT THE LAST 
YEAR IN ADVANCE OF THIS ON 
WEDNESDAY HIS SIX YEAR OLD SON WAS 
ATTACKED BY THE FAMILY DOG 
RESULTING IN THE ANIMAL BEING PUT 
DOWN AND LEAVING HIS SON WITH 
SEVERAL FACIAL INJURIES ALTHOUGH 
HE WAS WELL ENOUGH TO ATTEND 
TODAY'S SEMI FINAL IT WAS WATCHED 
BY BRIAN MOORE AND ANDREW COTTON LOOKING AHEAD TO THIS MEETING IN 
THE SUNSHINE AT ADAMS PARK IT IS 
HARD TO COMPLAIN SO MUCH AT STAKE 
PLAYER OF HISTORY BETWEEN THE TWO 
SIDES AND SO MUCH TALENT ON DISPLAY 
TEILLERIA AT THE HELM DALLAGLIO 
AT THE HELM THERE IS NEWS THAT 
IBANEZ IS A LATE WITHDRAWAL 
INSTEAD JOE WARD TAKES HIS PLACE 
BATH ALSO HAVE HOOKER PROBLEMS MASTERS OF THE PLAYERS WASPS 
THREE TIMES CHAMPION BUT IT IS 
BARKLEY AND BATH WHO GET THINGS 
UNDER WAY TEILLERIA GETS EARLY 
HANDS ON THE BALL DALLAGLIO HE 
WINNERS THE FIRST PENALTY FOR WASPS 
SOME HANDSOME FELLOWS THERE YES YES TWO WANTED MEN BOTH SIDES HAVING LOST THEIR 
FIRST CHOICE HOOKER SHORTLY BEFORE 
THE GAME IT WILL BE A CRUCIAL 
ASPECT OF THE GAME BATH WILL HAVE 
SURELY THE FIRST SHOT AT GOAL THE 
FIRST SHOT AT THREE POINTS 
APPLAUSE ALL ROUND 
I THINK THE 
REFEREE GOT THAT ONE RIGHT HE IS 
ONLY GUESSING AS INDEED AM I BUT 
IT LOOKED TO ME THAT BARNARD'S WAS 
UNDER PRESSURE BERNARD WAS UNDER 
PRESSURE 
HE KICKED HIS LAST FIFTEEN IN PRESSURE THE PREMIERSHIP BILL THEM UP AND MCLEOD AT ADAMS 
PARK WERE NOT COME DOWN THAT WAS A 
WILD ONE FROM BARKLEY BUILD THEM 
UP THE CRAB AT ADAMS PARK WILL NOT 
COME DOWN 
WORRYING FOR BATH NOT 
SO FOR WASPS THE CROWD A HEARTY THUMP DOWN THE FIELD 
MADDOCK FINDS SPACE HE WHEELS 
ROUND AND BOUNCES OFF A TACKLE 
BATH NOW WITH SPACE SACKEY NOW 
LOOKING FOR THE INTERCEPTION AND HE 
FINDS IT BUT THE WHISTLE WILL 
BRING THEM BACK 
I THINK IT IS 
GOING TO BE AN OFFSIDE FROM THE 
BREWING OF THE CROWD I THINK IT 
ALMOST CERTAINLY IS BOUIN 
ANOTHER CHANCE FOR BARKLEY 
FROM 
THE BOOS OF THE CROWD HE IS MISSED BY THREE OTHER PLAYERS 
I AM NOT SURE WHO HE GAVE OFF SIDE 
TO 
OLLY BARKLEY IS NOW ON A LESS TO THAN REMARKABLE STREAK OF ZERO FROM 
ONE A RESPECTFUL HUSH AND MY GOODNESS 
THAT IS ANOTHER WILD HALT 
WELL HE 
LOOKS ASTONISHED HE MAY BE BECAUSE 
THAT RUN WAS A SIMPLE ONE MILES TO TO SHOCKERS FROM OLLY BARKLEY BATH 
COULD BE LEADING BY SIX POINTS THE 
BALL TO CROCKETT BARKLEY DOES WELL BARNES JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE 
FLUENCY ABOUT THE BATH PLAY 
ABOUT HOW BATHS ARE PLAYING THE BOUNCE OF THE BALL IS VERY 
VERY GOOD DANGERS FOR WASPS A A GOOD PLOY THERE DANGEROUS FOR 
WASPS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO 
PUSH ON THE WASPS DEFENCE BUT THEY 
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT PRESSURE ON 
THE LINE OUT A GRIZZLED OLD VETERAN GRABS IT 
WASPS ARE UNDER REAL PRESSURE NOW 
THEY HAVE TO BUY THEMSELVES BIT 
OF SPACE FOR THE CLEARING KICK 
CIPRIANI A TRY FOR BATH FOR 
CROCKETT A GIFT 
A WELL WHAT CAN 
YOU SAY WELL WHAT CAN YOU SAY 
HE TAKES IT JUST AT THE LAST SECOND 
JUST AS HE IS ABOUT TO RECEIVE THE 
BALL SEE HOW MUCH TIME HE HAS GOT 
HE HAS NO TIME WHATSOEVER 
THEY ARE 
GOING TO THE VIDEO REFEREE WHAT WHAT FOR 
GET ON THE DECK GET ON WITH 
IT THEY DO FIVE POINTS KITTENS 
BEING HAD BY SHAUN EDWARDS WELL WELL THEY HAVE PROBABLY GOT WHAT THEY 
DESERVED BUT PROBABLY NOT IN THE 
WAY THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD 
GET IT I AM SURE ALWAYS A RISKY 
PLOY A VERY SMALL DEAD BALL AREA 
NOT VERY MUCH TIME AND IT IS A 
SIMPLE MISTAKE 
IT WAS LOUIS'S 
MISTAKE BUT ALMOST THE TEAM 
COLLECTIVELY FOR TRYING TO WORK 
THEIR WAY OUT OF THAT POSITION WHY WHY ARE THEY TRYING 
TO RUN 
THE BALL 
ANYWAY BEFORE THE 
BREAK DOWN 
I DO 
NOT KNOW 
IT SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN BOX 
KICKED DOWN 
THE FIELD 
AS FAR AS IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN 
TWO ATTEMPTS FROM 
BARKLEY SO FAR FAR FAR MORE 
STRAIGHTFORWARD THIS ONE BATH 
SCORE AND 
WELL MADE A CELEBRATE WELL MAY THEY CELEBRATE THEY HAVE 
ONLY HAD ONE REAL ATTACKING 
OPPORTUNITY 
ALMOST HALF AN HOUR OPPORTUNITY GONE AND IT COULD WELL BE MORE THAN 
SEVEN POINTS FOR THAT AT LEAST 
WASPS THIS SHOULD BE GRATEFUL BUT 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO SPEND SOME TIME 
IN THE BATH HALF IN BATH'S HALF 
SACKEY IS AWAY HE IS BURSTING 
THROUGH TACKLES THE WASPS' CROWD 
DESPERATELY WANT SOMETHING 
DALLAGLIO ONCE MORE QUICKER SLICKER PLAY FROM WASPS 
THE FIRST REAL EFFORT IN THE BATH 
TWENTY TWO AND IT LIFTS THEM AS REYES 
CARRIES ON HASKEL WILL BE KEEN TO HAVE A GO 
HE SCRAMBLES JUST A YARD OR TWO 
AGAIN A WANDER ROUND THE BLIND 
SIDE NO MORE THAN THAT HE SEES THAT TRY LINE NOW SPACE 
FOR WASPS WATERS GOES STRAIGHT 
THROUGH 
IMMEDIATE Y. 
WASPS HIT 
THROUGH IMMEDIATELY WASPS HIT BACK WELL FINISHED BY WATERS GOOD GOOD HAS THERE BY FLUTEY HANDS AT 
THAT ANGLE HOME AND DRY AS SOON AS 
HE CUT THE LINE A FANTASTIC 
RIPOSTE BY EIGHTEEN WHO KNOW THEIR WAY 
AROUND THE PLAY OFFS L. L. WONDER HOW 
MUCH BATH WILL MISS THEIR RUE 
THEIR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES AGAIN AGAIN THE NOISE BEGINS TO GROW AROUND 
ADAMS PARK HIGGINS IS SHUNTED BACK IT IS ALL 
WASPS AND NOW THEY WILL HAVE THE 
SCRUM JUST A FEW METRES FROM THE 
BATH LINE AND THEY DO HAVE THAT 
MOMENTUM 
WELL IT HAS BEEN TURNED MOMENTUM AROUND HASN'T IT IT WAS 
INCONCEIVABLE THAT WASPS WOULD NOT 
GET AN APPEARANCE IN THIS GAME THE THE SCRUM IS SOLID A BIG MOMENT NOW AS 
DALLAGLIO LINKS UP CIPRIANI SEES THE GAP SACKEY NOW 
IT IS A TRY THERE THEY CELEBRATE 
THEY ARE HAPPY THEY ARE CONVINCED 
IT 
WE BELIEVE A TRY HAS BEEN IT SCORED IS THERE ANY REASON WE 
CANNOT AWARD A TRY PLEASE 
IT IS A 
POSITIVE QUESTION FROM CHRIS WHITE 
THEY BELIEVE A TRY HAS BEEN SCORED 
BY RIKI FLUTEY LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
NO DOUBT AT ALL 
THANK YOU 
TRY IT 
IS TRY NUMBER TWO FOR WASPS THEY 
HAVE ROARED BACK INTO THIS GAME ON 
THE BACK FOOT NOW FIRMLY ON THE 
FRONT STRETCHES THE HOME SIDE 
CLEAR 
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I TOLD CLEAR YOU SO WHAT BUT IT WAS A QUESTION 
OF HOW BATH RESPONDED TO THE FIRST 
RIPOSTE THIS IS THE FIRST PASSAGE 
OF PLAY WHERE THEY HAD TO RESPOND 
I GOT THE FEELING IN THAT BATH 
WHEN THEY WERE WALKING BACK AFTER 
THE FIRST CALL LOOKED A BIT SHELL 
SHOCKED AS IF TO SAY TO THEMSELVES 
WE DO NOT DESERVE TO BE LEFT THAT THAT WAS AN UGLY LOOKING KICK BUT 
CIPRIANI STROKES IT THROUGH THE 
POSTS NOW WASPS HAVE THEIR CHANCE 
CIPRIANI ALWAYS TRIED TO CARRY OFF 
THE UNEXPECTED LOOKS TO BE IN 
BIT OF TROUBLE CIPRIANI HE HAS 
HURT HIS ANKLE ALL HIS CALF 
OH OH DEAR OH MY GOODNESS IT LOOKS BAD DEAR AND IT SOUNDS BAD OH MY WORD FOR 
DANNY CIPRIANI AND FOR ENGLAND AND 
TOM MARTIN JOHNSON BUT MOST OF ALL 
FOR DANNY CIPRIANI THIS LOOKS VERY 
BAD 
YOU CAN SEE THE ANGLE OF HIS BAD FOOT IT LOOKS TO BE PUSHED OUT L. 
DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT IS A BROKEN 
ANKLE OR JUST TOE AND LIGAMENTS 
BUT THE FOOD WAS INVERTED AT AN 
ANGLE BEFORE TWAS INVERTED AT AN 
ANGLE WHICH HE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE 
TO REACH WHAT A HORRIBLE MOMENT IN 
A GAME OF CELEBRATION AT THE END OF 
THE SEASON SO MUCH UP FOR GRABS 
AND A YOUNG MAN'S KOREA WILL BE 
CRUELLY CUT INTO HIS CAREER THE SCRUM IS BEING HEAVED ALL OVER 
THE PLACE THERE BATH HAVE ANOTHER 
CHANCE THEY HAVE A PENALTY BATH LOST THE BALL AND THEN 
COMMITTED A PENALTY TO STOP THE 
RESULTING BATH MOVE BUT THAT CAME 
DIRECTLY FROM THEM BEING UNABLE TO 
GET A STABLE PLATFORM FROM WHICH TO 
HOOK THEIR OWN BALL 
SEVEN POINTS 
ADRIFT OF THE TWO STRAIGHTFORWARD 
CHANCES THAT OLLY BARKLEY MISSED AT 
THE START OF THE GAME A CHANCE 
HERE TO AT LEAST CHIP AWAY AT THAT 
WASPS' LEAD 
WASPS ARE BEING 
TWISTED AND SHOVED IN THAT FRONT 
ROW 
START OF THE GAME KICKING ROW HORRIBLY OLLY BARKLEY NOW NEEDS 
TO STEP UP DIFFICULT IN TERMS OF 
DISTANCE A FAIRLY STRAIGHT KICK AS 
WELL STRAIGHT AND THROUGH THAT 
LEAD SHRINKS BATH HAVE REASON TO 
BLOW THEIR HORNS AND APPLAUD TOM VOYCE HAS IT TWO MEN QUICKLY 
UPON HIM NOW SIX OR SEVEN METRES 
OUT FROM THE BATH LINE AND WASPS 
COMING FORWARD WITH A FURY PALMER 
WITH A RAPIER THRUST BATH HAVE 
POSSESSION WASPS AND SCORE AND 
THE GAME IS MOVING BEYOND THE 
VISITORS 
THERE ARE THREE PLAYERS VISITORS ON THE BLIND SIDE THERE THAT HE 
SHOULD HAVE COUNTED HE DID NOT 
LOOK AT THE RUN BY PALMER 
PERFECTLY TIMED I SUGGEST THAT 
THAT IS A WINNING SCORE 
IN THE 
PROCESS TOM VOYCE HAS PICKED UP AN 
INJURY HE IS OFF VAN GISBERGEN 
REMAINS AND KEEPS THE EXTRA POINTS 
IT IS A BIG LEAD NOW FOR WASPS WASPS SHOWBOATING THEIR WAY TO 
TWICKENHAM THE CLOCK TICKS TOWARDS 
EIGHTY MINUTES THE CROWD ARE ASKING 
FOR THE WHISTLE A FRACTION EARLY 
THEY COUNT DOWN TO TWICKENHAM IT 
IS CALLING ONCE MORE WASPS WILL 
ONCE MORE HEAD DOWN A ROAD THEY 
KNOW SO WELL AND NOTHING WILL STOP 
AT GREAT GLADIATOR DE LA NEO 
LEADING HIS SIDE OUT THERE THE 
VICTORY HAS COME AT QUITE A COST 
BE GREAT GLADIATOR DE LA EARLIER 
AN AWFUL LOOKING INJURY FOR DANNY 
CIPRIANI WE WISH HIM ALL THE BEST 
HE WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE AT 
TWICKENHAM BUT WASPS WILL BE THERE 
ONE MORE GAME BEFORE THE END FOR 
DOOLALLY OLD PERHAPS ONE MORE 
TROPHY FOR LAWRENCE DALLAGLIO 
I THOUGHT WE WERE IMMENSE WE HAD 
TO OAK UP LOT OF PRESSURE WE 
DID DOMINATE BATH'S ATTACK THEY 
HAVE BEEN IN GREAT SHAPE 
I THINK 
WE PLAYED REASONABLY WELL IN THE 
FIRST THIRTY MINUTES JUST COULD NOT 
QUITE FINISHED THAT FORM CONTINUED 
THROUGHOUT THE SECOND HALF WHERE 
THINGS DID NOT QUITE WORK BUT THAT 
IS THE WAY OF THE GAME WASPS 
DEFENDED VERY WELL THANKFULLY IT 
WAS NOT A ONE SIDED SEMI FINAL AS 
WE SAW LAST SEASON 
OUR DEFENCE IS 
A MAJOR PART OF WINNING 
PERFORMANCES TODAY IT WAS 
DEFINITELY THE CASE WE HAD THE 
BALL FOR THIRTY OR FORTY PER CENT OF THE GAME TO 
PLAY AS WELL AS WE DID WAS CRUCIAL 
WE DREW LOT OF TODAY'S AGGRESSION 
FROM THE FACT THAT WE HAD BEEN 
WRITTEN OFF A FEW BATH PLAYERS 
SAID THEY WANTED TO FINISH US OFF 
AND THAT SPURS THE GUYS ON 
OBVIOUSLY IT IS DISAPPOINTING THE 
GUYS WERE SHOCKED BY DANNY'S INJURY 
AND TOM VOYCE'S INJURY WE HAVE TWO 
WEEKS TO PREPARE FOR MASSIVE GAME 
AND BRING OUT THE STOPS 
THE GUYS 
ARE DEVASTATED YOU WORK AS LONG AS 
YOU DO ALL SEASON TO GET TO THE 
FINALS AND TO MISS OUT IS 
DEVASTATING WE ALL HAVE OUR GOALS 
AND TO MISS OUT LIKE THAT IS 
DISAPPOINTING I THOUGHT THE EFFORT 
WAS OUTSTANDING IT ALWAYS IS WITH 
OUR TEAM BUT OUR EXECUTION LET US 
DOWN AND WE MISSED OUT ON THE 
SCORE BOARD 
THE HEADLINES TOMORROW WILL BEYOND 
THAT TERRIBLE INJURY TO DANNY 
CIPRIANI BRIAN MOORE IS IN THE 
STUDIO NOW OFF DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
THE SITUATION IS 
WE HAVE TO WAIT 
FOR THE SCAN OBVIOUSLY THE LEAD IS 
BROKEN AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE 
FOOTAGE BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS 
THAT CAN GO WRONG DISLOCATIONS 
SPINAL FRACTURES THEY ARE ALL KEY 
TO BEING A FOUR TO SIX MONTH INJURY 
OR A EIGHT TO NINE MONTHS' INJURY I I WAS STANDING TEN YARDS AWAY FIRSTLY 
YOU COULD HEAR A TERRIBLE SCREAM 
FROM DANNY THE WHOLE GROUND 
TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE ABSOLUTELY 
SILENT YOU COULD HAVE HEARD A PIN 
DROP BECAUSE EVERYONE KNEW HOW 
SERIOUS IT WAS 
WHENEVER THERE IS A 
SERIOUS INJURY PLAYERS REACT LIKE 
THEY DO WHEN THE PLAYERS REACT 
LIKE THAT AND PLAY STOPS YOU KNOW 
IT IS SERIOUS 
THE COACHES WERE 
OBVIOUSLY VERY CONCERNED AT THAT 
SITUATION AND DANNY GOT A 
TREMENDOUS RECEPTION WHEN HE WAS 
CARRIED OFF DID THAT HAVE AN 
IMPACT ON THE WASPS TEAM 
IMMEDIATELY HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO 
PUT THAT TO ONE SIDE 
YOU HAVE TO 
BE PRAGMATIC ABOUT THE WHOLE THING 
OVER THE YEARS YOU LEARN TO NOT 
WORRY ABOUT IT YOU FORGET ABOUT 
INJURIES YOU JUST WORRY ABOUT THE 
GUY COMING IN AND WHO IS PLAYING 
WELL YOU GET ON WITH THE DOG IN 
HAND IT IS ONLY AFTER THE MATCH 
THAT YOU WORRY ABOUT HOW THINGS 
STAND ALL THE GUYS WILL WANT TO 
GIVE HIM A CALL TONIGHT TO SEE HOW 
HE IS GETTING ON L. FEEL SORRY FOR HIM 
IT WAS HIS GREAT MOMENT TO HIM STAMP HIS AUTHORITY AND HE WILL 
NOT HAVE THAT NOW ALL OF US WISH 
DANNY THE VERY BEST LET'S TALK 
ABOUT THE GAME WHAT DID YOU MAKE 
OF IT 
HE TOOK HIS EYE OFF THE BALL 
IT WAS A DODGY MOVE BECAUSE THERE 
ARE NOT LONG DEAD BALLS ON THIS 
GROUND SO HE IS UNDER PRESSURE 
ANYWAY IT WAS A BOX KICK ANYWAY 
BEFORE IT WENT TO THIS BREAK DOWN 
IT WAS NOT THE BEST OF PASSES BUT 
YOU WOULD EXPECT AN EXPERIENCED 
INTERNATIONAL TO CATCH THAT BUT HE 
WAS UNDER PRESSURE BUT HE HAS 
PLAYED ORWELL WELL SO SEASON YOU 
WOULD FORGIVE HIM IT WAS ONLY 
SEVEN POINTS THEY WERE DOWN AND 
DUMP OF THEN WASPS BLITZED THEM 
THE BATH PLAYERS WERE LOOKING ROUND 
AS IF TO SAY WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND 
WHY WE ARE DOWN BECAUSE WE HAVE 
HAD THE PREDOMINANT PLAY DURING THE 
FIRST HALF AND YET WE WILL GO IN 
BEHIND 
YOUR DEFENCE WAS IMMENSE BEHIND AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A 
SECOND RIKI FLUTEY SCORED FOR YOU 
HE HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING PLAYER 
YEAH THE ARGUMENT ABOUT FOREIGN 
PLAYERS PLAYING FOR ENGLAND WILL 
CROP UP WITH HIM 
WOULD YOU PICK 
HIM IN THE ENGLAND TEAM 
ON FORM I 
WOULD GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO STAKE 
HIS CLAIM AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL 
UNTIL PLAYERS PLAY YOU DO NOT KNOW 
HOW THEY WILL GET ON SOME THINK IF 
YOU ARE NOT ENGLISH YOU SHOULD NOT 
PLAY FOR ENGLAND BUT THE RULES ARE 
THE RULES HE IS A CLASS ACT AND I 
AM SURE HE WILL GET A SHOT AT SOME 
POINT 
YOUR SCRUM WAS UNDER POINT PRESSURE THE LINEOUT WAS NOT 
IRREPLACEABLE AND YET YOUR DEFENCE 
VERY RARELY DID YOU LOOK LIKE BEING 
BREACHED IS THAT ALL THE SHAUN 
EDWARDS FACTOR 
IT WAS A LARGE PART 
THAT BUT YOU ARE BEGINNING TO SEE 
YOU NOW EIGHTY TEAMS MOVING AWAY FROM 
THE OLD SCHOOL THINKING OF WINNING 
THE SCRUM AT WASPS WE HAVE NEVER 
DONE THAT WE STILL WON THE GAME 
SOME TEAMS SPEND HOURS SORTING OF 
THOSE PHASES OUT BUT WE DO NOT DO 
THAT OBVIOUSLY IT IS A BIG 
PRIORITY TO GET THEM RIGHT THE 
MORE YOU WIN THE EASIER THE GAME 
BECOMES BUT WE PRIORITISE OUR 
DEFENCE AND ATTACK IF YOU GET YOUR 
ATTACK RIGHT AND NOT EXPOSE 
YOURSELF TO TURNOVERS IT IS ALL 
THOSE FACETS OF THE GAME THAT HAVE 
BEEN SECRET OF OUR SUCCESS 
A QUICK 
WORD ON BATH BRIAN BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE CUT SO MANY DEFENCES TO SHREDS 
THIS SEASON HAVE THEY RUN OUT OF 
PUFF 
I THOUGHT THEY WERE IMPRECISE PUFF THEY TRIED TOO HARD TO FORCE THINGS 
AT TIMES BUT THEY TRIED EVERYWHERE 
THEY COULD THINK OF TO GET ROUND 
THE DEFENCE AND NONE OF THEM 
WORKED SOME OF THE KICKS THEY WERE 
PUTTING BEHIND WERE TOO LONG AND 
WHEN IT CAME TO OUTFLANKING PEOPLE 
THEY WERE NOT PASSING THE BALL WE WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE FINAL LATER AND 
ALSO ABOUT TOM VOYCE BUT ALSO THIS 
WEEK IT HAS BEEN A CHANCE FOR 
MARTIN JOHNSON TO TELL US WHAT HE 
WILL DO WITH THE ENGLAND TEAM IN 
THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME THERE 
IS NO END OF THIS RUGBY SEASON 
BECAUSE THE WASPS GUYS WHO WERE 
PLAYING IN THAT FINAL WERE SELECTED 
FOR ENGLAND AND WILL BE PLAYING A 
WEEK LATER THE EXAMINATION OF THE 
JOHNSON REGIME BEGAN THIS WEEK 
A BRIAN ASHTON KEPT FAITH WITH 
LESLIE VAINIKOLO THROUGHOUT THE SIX 
NATIONS CHAMPIONSHIP WHY DO THEY 
NOT MAKE THE GRADE HERE 
WE THOUGHT 
THE GUYS WERE ABOVE THEM IN TERMS 
OF FORM AT THE MOMENT L. SPOKE TO 
LESLEY AND EXPLAINED THAT TO HIM 
AND THEY UNDERSTOOD LESLEY HAS HAD 
SOME INJURY ISSUES HE WORKED IT 
WOULD BE GOOD FOR BOTH THOSE GUYS 
TO HAVE A DECENT BREAK AND AS 
COACHES OUR FITNESS TEAM WILL ALSO 
SPEAK TO THEM AND LET THEM KNOW 
WHERE WE THINK THEY NEED TO IMPROVE 
IN TERMS OF GETTING BACK INTO THE 
SQUAD SO ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT 
GOING THEY ARE NOT DISCARDED THEY 
ARE PART OF A WIDER SELECTION 
PROCESS OF WHO IS AVAILABLE IAIN 
BALSHAW WILL BEYOND THAT TEAM A A SIX UNCAPPED PLAYERS DO YOU FEAR 
IT COULD BE A BAPTISM OF FIRE IN 
NEW ZEALAND IT IS ALWAYS A BAPTISM 
OF FIRE IN NEW ZEALAND 
THE PLAYERS 
DESERVE THEIR PLACE IN THE SQUAD 
AND IT IS AS TOUGH A TOUR AS YOU 
CAN EXPERIENCE IN INTERNATIONAL 
PLAY IT IS A TOUGH ARENA SO 
WHETHER THEY GET ON THE FIELD OR 
NOT THEY WILL COME BACK AS MORE 
EXPERIENCED PLAYERS 
YOU ARE NOT 
GOING FOR PERSONAL REASONS HAVING 
PICKED THE SQUAD IS THERE A BIT OF 
YOU THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS 
THROUGH 
OF COURSE YOU WOULD PART THROUGH OF THE RUGBY EXPERIENCE IS GOING 
THROUGH EVERYTHING GOOD AND BAD 
WITH THE PLAYERS IT IS A BIT 
AWKWARD TO BE LEFT AT HOME WE PUT 
THE SQUAD TOGETHER WE MADE THE 
DECISIONS IN TERMS OF WHO DOES NOT 
GO AND THEN WE GET ON WITH IT WE 
COME BACK ON THE FIRST JULY AND NEED 
TO PICK THE SQUAD IT WILL BE GREAT 
TO GO GET TOGETHER WITH THE PLAYERS IF YOU DID NOT SEE THE SQUAD WHO 
ENGLAND HAVE NAMED YOU CAN SEE 
SOME FAMILIAR NAMES AS WELL AS SOME 
UNFAMILIAR ONES 
AS YOU MOVE ON TO THE BACK DIVISION 
SOME CHANGES THERE TOO 
IT HAS THROWN IT INTO A MAKES AGAIN 
YOU'RE HALF BACK PAIRINGS ARE SO 
CRUCIAL INTO A MIX L. WOULD 
THINK THAT THEY WOULD LOOK AT OLLY 
BARKLEY MOVING BACK THERE GIVEN 
THAT THERE IS NO REAL OUTSTANDING 
ALTERNATIVE THAT IS AT LEAST ONE 
POSITION THAT THEY MIGHT SEEK TO 
PLAY BECAUSE HE HAS EXPERIENCE AS 
WELL 
WHAT CONTACTED YOU HAVE WITH WELL MARTIN JOHNSON SINCE HE BECAME THIS 
SUPREMO 
I HAVE SPOKEN TO HIM A FEW SUPREMO TIMES I HAVE SPOKEN TO HIM I 
HAVE WORKED WITH HIM OVER THE YEARS 
AND GET ON WELL WITH HIM L. AM SURE 
HE IS GOING TO BE PHENOMENAL IN THE 
JOB 
WHAT YOU THINK HE WILL BRING JOB TO THE POSITION THAT WASN'T THERE 
BEFORE 
IT IS A TOUGH ONE HE HAS A BEFORE ROLE THAT IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TO 
THE PRECEDING FIVE YEARS NOW HE 
HAS COMPLETE POWER HE WILL BE ABLE 
TO BRING HIS TOUGH EDGE TO THEIR 
GAME BUT HE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THE 
WIDER PICTURE THAT IS A BIG THING 
I THINK IT WAS A SLIGHTLY 
MISLEADING QUESTION REALLY THE 
WRONG PREMISE REALLY THAT ROLE 
WAS NOT THERE BEFORE THAT IS WHAT 
WE HAVE BEEN SHOUTING ABOUT FOR SO 
LONG GET THE STRUCTURE SORTED OUT 
AND FIT THE PEOPLE INTO IT NOW 
THEY HAVE DONE THAT EVERYONE CAN 
MOVE FORWARD THEY CAN ONLY BE ONE 
PERSON IN CHARGE BUT THE PROBLEM 
WAS WHO WOULD IT BE 
THE HAVE BEEN 
THROUGH THAT BEFORE 
WE HAVE BEEN 
TO THAT BEFORE HE HAS THAT 
ATTENTION TO DETAIL BUT IT WILL 
ALL DEPEND ON THE SUCCESSFUL 
CHOOSING OF A TEAM TO WORK UNDER 
HIM 
MCGEECHAN IS THE NEW MAN HEAD HIM HEAD MAN AT THE LIONS YOU MUST 
BE DELIGHTED ABOUT THAT 
I AM SURE 
EVERYONE IS PLEASED THERE WAS NO 
OTHER CONTENDER CLOSE TO HIM 
HE IS 
VERY FAIR SCRUPULOUSLY FAIR HE 
LOOKS AT PEOPLE AS THEY PERFORM ON 
TOUR I KNOW THAT FROM EXPERIENCE 
HE IS IN A SLIGHTLY ODD POSITION 
FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE TEAMS HAVE 
BEEN SAYING WE DO NOT ONE GATLAND 
TO BE CONSIDERED BUT MCGEECHAN HAS 
SHOWN IN THE PAST THAT HE IS QUITE 
ABLE TO CUP MEANT 
COMPARTMENTALISE HIS VARIOUS ROLES 
SUCCESSFULLY O. K. BACK TO THE 
ACTION ACTION THE TIGERS HAD AN UNUSUAL WARM UP 
REGIME BECAUSE TO RAISE MONEY FOR 
THEIR FORMER PROP WHO WAS PARALYSED 
WHEN THE SCRUM COLLAPSED HIPKISS 
LED AN ALL STAR BAND LISTEN TO 
THIS 
EWING NEVER CAUGHT A RABBIT 
YOU AIN'T NEVER CAUGHT RABBIT FANCY SEEING YOU HERE I DOUBT EVEN 
MARTIN CURRY AND LEICESTER THOUGHT 
THEY WOULD BE COMING OUT AS THE 
LAST RITES WERE BEING ADMINISTERED 
AT THE END OF THE REGULAR SEASON 
HERE THEY ARE FORM AND HISTORY 
MEAN NOTHING HE AND LEICESTER HAVE 
BEEN BUSY PLOTTING A WEST COUNTRY 
AMBUSH ALL WEEK HERE COME GLOUCESTER THEY HAVE 
TOPPED THE TABLE FOR THE THIRD TIME 
IN SIX YEARS AT THE END OF THE 
REGULAR SEASON THEY FINISHED A 
FULL TEN POINTS AHEAD OF LEICESTER 
BACK IN FOURTH PLACE BUT THESE 
PLAYERS KNOW THAT MEANS ABSOLUTELY 
NOTHING TODAY IT IS A CUP FINAL 
IT IS A ONE OFF AND THEY KNOW WHAT 
IS AT STAKE BOTH TEAMS HAVE SEVEN 
SURVIVORS FROM THE STARTING LINE 
UPS OF LAST YEAR'S FINAL LEICESTER 
COACH DOES THE LEICESTER COACH HAS BEEN CAUSED INTO ONE 
CHANGE FOR WHAT COULD BE 
CONCEIVABLY HIS LAST MATCH IN 
CHARGE HAS BEEN FORCED INTO ONE CHANGE A FAMILIAR FACE IN CHARGE DAVE 
PEARSON WHO WAS HERE A WEEK AGO 
HE TOOK THE GAME AND THESE TWO MET 
TWELVE MONTHS AGO AT TWICKENHAM FOR THE 
TITLE TODAY IT IS ALL ABOUT 
WINNING TICKET FOR TWICKENHAM AND 
THE RIGHT TO PLAY WASPS IN A 
FORTNIGHT GLOUCESTER WILL KICK OFF 
A YEAR AGO THIS WEEKEND THEY MADE 
FORTY SIX POINTS IN THAT FINAL TODAY IS 
ABOUT REVENGE AND IS ABOUT GOING 
ONE BETTER LEICESTER KNOW THAT 
ONLY ONE TEAM HAS MANAGED TO LEAVE 
HERE WITH A PREMIER LEAGUE WIN IN 
THE REGULAR SEASON AND THEY ARE 
THAT TEAM DEFENSIVE DETAIL EARLY 
ON THOUGH LAMB A CHIP AHEAD 
THIS IS A BRIGHT BRIGHT START FROM 
GLOUCESTER RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT 
THAT THE BALL WAS KNOCKED ON GLOUCESTER SIGNALLED THEIR INTENT FROM THE START VAINIKOLO ON THE CHARGE PICKED UP 
BY JAMES SIMPSON DANIEL WALKER 
GOES TO GROUND THIS IS THE HOOKER TITTERRELL THE 
FIRST PENALTY ALL THE PRESSURE 
THAT HAS BEEN GLOUCESTER'S AT THE 
START OF THE GAME FINALLY LEADS TO 
SOMETHING TANGIBLE A KICK AT GOAL 
AND 
THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF POINTS LAMB TENS TWENTY TWO TODAY STILL CARRIES THE SCARS FROM LAST YEAR'S FINAL 
SCARS THAT ARE SLOWLY BEGINNING TO 
HEAL AND THAT WILL HELP GLOUCESTER 
DESERVEDLY AHEAD FIVE MINUTES GONE 
THEY LEAD BY THREE ZERO LAMB WITH THE 
PENALTY A GREAT START TO THE GAME ANOTHER PENALTY COMING LEICESTER'S WAY ANOTHER PENALTY THE BEST WISHES OF ALL LEICESTER 
FOLK GO WITH HIM OH NO IT IS 
JUST JUST HE GETS THE THREE 
POINTS BUT THIS IS HOW CLOSE HE 
WAS TO NOT GETTING THEM ALTHOUGH 
IT IS RED AND WHITE POST IT IS 
THREE POINTS FOR LEICESTER FIFTEEN 
MINUTES GONE NO SCORE IN TERMS OF 
TRIES YET THREE EACH IN TERMS OF 
PENALTIES BUT IT HAS BEEN A VERY 
BRIGHT START TO THEIR GAME AND 
GLOUCESTER HAVE ANOTHER PENALTY HIPKISS BRINGING THE BALL AWAY 
CORRY PICKED UP BY PEARSON EITHER 
WAY IT IS CLUSTER PENALTY AND A 
CHANCE TO RE ESTABLISH THE LEAD 
AND A CHANCE TO RE ESTABLISH THE 
LEAD GLOUCESTER ARE BACK IN FRONT 
THEY LEAD SIX TO THREE LAMB HAS HAD TWO 
PENALTIES A MOMENT OF HIGH ANTICIPATION AND 
THE FIRST FOR WHILE A PEAK OF THE WHISTLE AND DAVE PEARSON WANTS 
TO HAVE A LITTLE LECTURE HERE 
YELLOW CARD BEING FISHED OUT OF THE 
POCKET TRAIN IS OFF FOR TEN MINUTES 
CRANE THE FIRST TIME IN WHILE 
THAT GLOUCESTER HAD REALLY 
STRETCHED LEICESTER'S DEFENCE THE 
RESULT IS YELLOW CARD AND THE 
SIN BIN FOR CRANE LAMB DECIDING 
THAT DESPITE THE POSTS BEEN ON 
OFFER IT IS NOT WHAT THEY WANT 
HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL HERE THAT 
IS THE WORST THING THEY COULD HAVE 
DONE THEY HANDED IT TO LEICESTER 
THEY WILL FIRE IT INTO THE SHED AND 
GIVE LEICESTER SOME BREATHING SPACE TITTERRELL AGAIN THE RECIPIENT OF 
HIS OWN BORN AGAIN VERY QUICKLY 
OF HIS OWN BALL AGAIN ANOTHER 
PENALTY CONCEDED LEICESTER ARE 
BEGINNING TO COUGH UP MORE AND MORE 
PENALTIES THEY ARE THE ONES UNDER 
LOTS AND LOTS OF PRESSURE AT THE 
MOMENT IT MIGHT BE TIME TO PUT SOME POINTS 
ON THE BOARD THEY ARE GOING FOR 
THE POSTS LAMB THE BIRTHDAY BOY 
NINE TO THREE TO GLOUCESTER PLAYED FOR THE 
BEST PART OF HALF AN HOUR IT HAS 
BEEN A FABULOUS GAME TO WATCH 
LEICESTER HAVE ENJOYED THE BEST OF 
THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES BUT 
GLOUCESTER HAVE THE POINTS THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME SPACE THAN 
THAT DEFENCE CRANE IS STILL 
SITTING ON THE SIDELINE IN THAT 
DEFENCE THE HINT OF AN INTERCEPTION 
OPPORTUNITY IT IS ANOTHER PENALTY 
THEY WERE PLAYING THE ADVANTAGE 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER TRIP TO 
THE HEADMASTER'S OFFICE ELLIS IS 
MAKING THE TRIP TO THE OFFICE IT 
IS ANOTHER YELLOW CARD AN 
ACCUMULATION OF PENALTIES NOT 
NECESSARILY ALL ELLIS'S FOLD BUT 
LEICESTER ARE DOWN TO THIRTEEN PLAYERS 
AND COCKEREL IS MAKING HIS THOUGHTS 
KNOWN TO IS MAKING HIS THE IT'S 
NONE THESE ARE BIG PROBLEMS FOR 
LEICESTER GLOUCESTER ARE BEING PATIENT 
LEICESTER ARE BEING PURPOSEFUL IN 
DEFENCE BROWN WAS TACKLED BY 
STANKOVICH FOUR MINUTES TO GO 
FOUR MINUTES TO THE BREAK THIS WAS 
THE MOMENT YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
FOR GLOUCESTER BORTOLAMI THE 
SKIPPER IT IS ANOTHER PENALTY ON 
THIS OCCASION NO YELLOW CARD JORDAN CRANE IS BACK ON WIDELY 
REGARDED AS THE MOST CONSISTENT 
TEAM OF THE SEASON THEY ARE MAKING 
THE MOST OF IT THEY HAVE EXTENDED 
THE LEAD THEY HAVE GOT NINE 
POINT CUSHION AND LEICESTER ARE 
PAYING THE PRICE FOR INDISCIPLINE 
LEICESTER JUST SENSING THAT THAT 
BALL MIGHT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR THE 
TURNOVER BUT GLOUCESTER MANAGED TO 
KEEP THEIR HANDS ON IT SIMPSON 
DANIEL BROUGHT TO GROUND BY 
VARNDELL AND DANNY HIPKISS HALF 
TIME FIVE PENALTIES BUT THE REAL 
STORY THE TWO YELLOW CARD 
LEICESTER IN DISCIPLINE MEANS THAT 
GLOUCESTER WITH ALL THEIR 
DOMINANCE AND TERRITORY IN 
POSSESSION LEAD AT THE BREAK THE CHAMPIONS LEICESTER HAVE FORTY 
MINUTES TO TRY AND HOLD ON TO THEIR 
CROWN FOR THE END OF SEASON 
SHOWPIECE AT TWICKENHAM FOR THE 
FOURTH SEASON IN ROW TIPPED UP 
BY WASPS AND SALE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND TWO THOUSAND SIX 
THEY BEAT GLOUCESTER YEAR AGO 
BUT IS THIS TO BE REVENGE FOR THE 
CHERRY AND WHITES NINE POINT CUSHION 
AT HALF TIME AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY 
FOR LEICESTER TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT 
THAT TACKLER NOT ROARING AWAY THE 
WAY ANDY GOODE HAS BEEN KICKING SO 
FAR I WOULD SUSPECT THAT THIS 
MIGHT BE BEYOND HIS REACH BUT HE 
MIGHT BE GOING FOR IT WHEN ANDY 
GOODE HIS HEART HE IS HOT HE HAS 
GOT IT ON TARGET HE HAS GOT THE 
DISTANCE INCREDIBLE GLOUCESTER 
ARE TRYING TO STRETCH THINGS LEICESTER THINK THEY HAVE GOT IT A 
NUMBER OF THEM WERE ON THE FLOOR 
AND THEY CONCEDE THE PENALTY AND THAT ONE IS GOOD THEY HAVE 
ERASED ANDY GOODE'S PENALTY AT THE 
START OF THIS SECOND HALF AND 
RESTORED THEIR NINE POINT LEAD MEFIN DAVIES HAS FILLED IN VERY 
HANDILY AS A SQUAD PLAYER THIS 
SEASON FOR LEICESTER OH ALEX TUILAGI HE WAS GIVEN AN 
INCH AND THE TRY HAS BEEN GIVEN 
ROW WIND TO TWICKENHAM TWELVE MONTHS 
BEFORE WE WIND AND ANNEXED WERE 
LIKELY WAS MOTORING HIS WAY THROUGH 
THE CHERRY AND WHITE DEFENCE THERE

PICTURES WHAT A MOMENT IT IS A 
TRY AARON MAUGER HAS HIS SECOND 
TRY OF THE SEASON THE CONVERSION 
IS OVER IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME BUT 
WHAT WOULD GLOUCESTER THINKING OF 
HERE RYAN LAMB WOULD BE A KICK 
ALWAYS GOING TO BE A LOTTERY FROM 
THAT POINT ON IS IT 
NARRAWAY 
WITH THE LOOSE BALL IT CAME OFF 
THE POST AND AARON MAUGER SCORED 
IT MIGHT COME DOWN TO EXPERIENCE 
AND KNOW HOW AND STREET SAVVYNESS 
GLOUCESTER OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
SEASON HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING THAT 
MASSIVE WIN AT WASPS A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS AGO IT IS A PENALTY TO 
LEICESTER THEY HELD OFF THE 
CHALLENGES AT BATH LAST WEEKEND 
BUT NOW THEY ARE UP AGAINST THE 
PAST MASTERS LEICESTER HAVE THE 
PENALTY AND THEY HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO GO AHEAD FOR THE 
FIRST TIME A WEEK AGO THEY HAD BEEN WRITTEN 
OFF THEY WERE FISHING OUT THE 
SUNTAN LOTION FOR THE BEACH AND THE 
SUMMER HOLIDAY NOW WITH A LITTLE 
OVER TEN MINUTES TO GO LEICESTER 
AHEAD AT KINGSHOLM IF THINGS STAY 
THE SAME LEICESTER WILL BE AT 
TWICKENHAM IN A FORTNIGHT COOL 
HEADS NEEDED NOW ANTHONY ALLEN WILL PUT ABSOLUTELY 
EVERYTHING INTO WHAT IS LEFT OF 
THIS GAME AFTER THE PAIN OF A YEAR 
AGO A PENALTY WOULD PUT GLOUCESTER 
BACK AHEAD AND THEY HAVE GOT THE 
PENALTY OH WHO SAYS THE PLAYERS 
DON'T GIVE YOU DRAMA THIS IS 
ALMOST UNBEARABLE GLOUCESTER HAVE 
GOT THAT KICK TO RETAKE THE LEAD HE HAS MISSED IT THAT SHOULD BE 
GLOUCESTER AHEAD BUT THAT IS WHAT 
NERVES DO TO YOU THAT IS WHAT 
MOMENTS LIKE THIS DUTY EVEN THE 
BEST LEICESTER STILL HAVE A ONE 
POINT LEAD THEY CAN BARELY BELIEVE 
IT ALEX BROWN DOING REALLY WELL 
WHAT A SPIRITED RESPONSE FROM THE 
TEAM WHO SAID THEY WERE NOT GROWN 
UP ENOUGH A YEAR AGO THEY NEEDED 
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL TO LEARN ABOUT 
THE HARSH REALITY OF RUGBY AT THE 
TOP LEVEL BUT THIS IS THEIR END 
OF SEASON EXAM MAKE NO MISTAKE 
THEY ARE SITTING IT NOW THEY ARE 
TRYING TO SHOW US ALL WHAT THEY 
HAVE LEARNT THAT THEY DO HAVE THE 
TEMPERAMENT TO CLOSE AT THE BIGGEST 
OF GAMES THEY HAVE BEEN TOP FOR 
MUCH OF THE SEASON WILLIE WALKER 
WITH THE DROP GOAL IT IS THERE 
THE MAN HAS SENT GLOUCESTER BERSERK 
THE PASS NEEDED TO BE PERFECT IT 
WAS THE KICK TOO AND THE POSTS 
HAVE SMILED ON GLOUCESTER AND THE 
NEW ZEALANDER THIS IS REALLY 
SPIRITED NOW FROM LEICESTER THE 
SKIPPER SIGNED UP FOR ONE MORE 
SEASON AARON MAUGER WHOSE TRY 
BROUGHT THEM BACK INTO IT 
FORTUITOUSLY FACE MADE OVER TWO 
MINUTES TO GO A SMITH OVER 
DROP GOAL SPEECHLESS CAPTIVATING 
STUFF AT THE END OF A CAPTIVATING 
GAME AND NOW IT IS LEICESTER WITH 
THE TICKET TO TWICKENHAM WE HAVE 
TWO MINUTES TO GO LEICESTER JUST 
NEED TO HANG ON TO IT THE MOMENT 
WHEN JORDAN CRANE WAS YANO HARDEEP 
YELLOW CARDED FOLLOWED BY HARRY 
ELLIS LOOKED LIKE GLOUCESTER WERE 
GOING TO TAKE CONTROL BUT DEAN 
RYAN'S MEN COULD NOT DO THAT NO 
ONE HAS EVER QUESTIONED THE 
CHARACTER OF THIS LEICESTER SIDE 
ANDY GOODE ROLLS BACKWARDS KICKS 
THE BALL INTO TOUCH AND WHAT ONE 
OF SPORT'S MOST ASTONISHING STORIES 
THIS YEAR HAS ANOTHER CHAPTER 
WRITTEN A YEAR RON FROM TWICKENHAM 
AND ONCE AGAIN IT IS LEICESTER A 
YEAR ON THE HEARTBREAKS FOR 
GLOUCESTER THEY TOPPED THE TABLE 
FOR THE BULK OF THE SEASON BUT THE 
WINNER'S BOILS GO TO LEICESTER 
THEY ARE OFF TO TWICKENHAM IT WILL 
BE WASPS AGAINST LEICESTER FOR THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP A GAME 
WE JUST 
STUCK AT IT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE 
WERE DOWN TO THIRTEEN MEN WE STAYED IN 
THE GAME IT WAS NOT OUR BEST RUGBY 
BUT WE STAYED CLOSE STUCK AT IT 
WHEN YOU GET ANDY GOODE ON YOUR 
SIDE GREAT FINISH YOU ALWAYS 
STAND CHANCE 
WE GOT WHAT WE 
DESERVED THE BOYS WERE PLAYING FOR 
SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS WHEN YOU COME 
TO THESE FINAL STAGES YOU WILL GET 
KNOCKED DOWN IF YOU PLAY POORLY WE 
HAVE TO ACCEPT ACCOUNTABILITY THAT 
WAS A GAME WE SHOULD HAVE WON 
EASILY WE TOOK OPTIONS THAT WE DID 
NOT UNDERSTAND WE COMMITTED 
SUICIDE IN THE SECOND HALF WHEN 
ALL WE NEEDED TO DO WAS CALM THINGS 
DOWN AND PLAY THE PERCENTAGES AND 
BE PATIENT WE WERE NOT ANY OF 
THOSE THINGS WHEN YOU ARE NOT YOU 
ARE OUT WE HAVE NOT GOT ANYWHERE 
TO GO FROM THERE 
REALLY HAPPY THE 
PLAYERS MADE A VERY GOOD GAME WE 
KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE HARD BUT 
WE KNEW THAT WE HAD TO WIN THE 
COLLISIONS WE HAD TO PLAY ON THE 
FRONT FOOT AGAINST GLOUCESTER 
GLOUCESTER IS A VERY INTENSE AND 
PHYSICAL TEAMED BUT WE KNEW THAT 
IF WE COULD DOMINATE ON THAT WE 
COULD HAVE A CHANCE MAYBE TO WIN 
THE GAME AND THE PLAYERS DID A 
GREAT PERFORMANCE 
IN THE WEEK THAT AVRAM GRANT TAKES 
CHELSEA TO MOSCOW HOW CAN 
LEICESTER BE TALKING ABOUT GETTING 
RID OF THE MAN THAT GOT THEM TO THE 
FINAL 
IT 
IS A LOT IF HE WINS HE FINAL IS PROBABLY SAFE IF THEY DO NOT 
WIN THEY MAY STILL TAKE THAT 
OPTION BUT I HOPE IT IS NOT THE 
START OF THE FOOTBALL SHORT TERMISM 
COMING IN YOU HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE 
CHANCES AND ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO 
PICKED HIM WHERE ARE THEY IN THEIR 
JOB YOU HAVE PICK SOMEONE WHO HAS 
ONLY LASTED SIX MONTHS THEY SHOULD 
GIVE HIM MORE TIME 
IT WAS AN 
EXTRAORDINARY GAME BUT IN A SENSE 
IT SWUNG ON THAT BIZARRE TRY FOR 
AARON MAUGER WHEN IAIN BALSHAW 
THROUGH A PASS THAT HE WILL 
PROBABLY WONDER WHY HE DID IT HOW 
DID YOU SEE THIS 
GAMES ARE OFTEN 
LOST ON SILLY MISTAKES LIKE THESE 
BAD KICK FOLLOWED BY BAD PASS IT 
HAS COST US GAMES BASIC ERRORS 
TEAMS THAT GO ON TO WIN MAKE VERY 
FEW BASIC ERRORS LIKE THIS GIVING 
AWAY TRIES YOU DEFEND SO WELL FOR 
THE DURATION OF THE MATCH AND THEN 
GIVE ONE AWAY IT IS NOT GREAT THE THE CARDINAL RULE WHICH TEAMS ARE UNDER 
PRESSURE FAILED TO FOLLOW HIS WHEN 
YOU ARE IN A BAD POSITION PASSING 
BACKWARDS WILL INEVITABLY MAKE IT 
WORSE PEOPLE COMING ON TO THAT MAN 
HE IS STATIC WHATEVER TROUBLE YOU 
ARE IN WHEN HE GETS IT HE IS 
FURTHER BEHIND AND IT MAKES IT 
WORSE IF HE HAD HUNG ON TO THAT 
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN HIT BUT THE 
CHANCE WAS HE COULD KILL IT IT IT IAN BALSHAW HAS HAD CRITICS BUT 
NOBODY GETS MORE FLAK THAN ANDY 
GOODE AND YET HE IS THE HERO AGAIN 
HE IS REMEMBER GAME HE WON WITH 
ONE OF THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS DROP 
GOALS I HAVE EVER SEEN HE IS ONE 
OF THE MEN I WOULD HAVE TAKING A 
SHOT LIKE THAT 
YOU WERE NOT 
EXPECTING HIM TO BE PLAYING IN THE 
FINAL YOU HAVE AN AWFUL NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE MISSING LIKE DANNY CIPRIANI 
HOW DO YOU READ THE MATCH IN TWO 
WEEKS' TIME 
I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO 
DIGEST EVERYTHING BUT IT IS THE 
OLD ENEMY AGAIN WE HAVE HAD 
TITANIC STRUGGLES WITH THEM IN 
EUROPE AND THE LEAD LEICESTER AT 
TWICKENHAM AGAIN ROLLS OFF THE CAN 
EASILY 
WHO DO YOU THINK WILL WIN EASILY ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WILL WIN BY 
QUITE A MARGIN THE HISTORY HAS 
BEEN THAT ONE SIDE IS REALLY GOOD 
I REMEMBER THE YEAR THAT WASPS 
PHYSICALLY DOMINATED LEICESTER AND 
VICE VERSA L. THINK WASPS WILL HAVE 
A HARD TIME 
HE IS CONFIRMATION OF 
THE 
GUINNESS PREMIERSHIP FUNNEL 
THAT YOU CAN SEE ON B. B. C. TELEVISION 
FINAL 
WASPS AGAINST LEICESTER IN THE 
FINAL OF THE GUINNESS PREMIERSHIP 
WILL IT BE LAWRENCE DALLAGLIO'S 
FINAL HARA BYE BYE
