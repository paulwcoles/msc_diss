AND RACE IT 
BASICALLY DON'T MESS THIS UP WE'VE GOT TO WIN 
O. K. GOOD LUCK 
AND I MAKE A BAG PERFECT FOR THE BEACH 
HI HELLO WELCOME TO THE SHOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
I NOTICE THERE'S SOME SUMMERY THINGS IN THE STUDIO I'M GLAD YOU NOTICED 
THERE'S A REASON BEHIND THIS BECAUSE TODAY MY FRIENDS 
I'M GOING TO MAKE A BEACH BAG 
WHAT THAT'S GOT DISASTER WRITTEN ALL OVER IT YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT 
THAT'S WHY I'VE ASKED FOR SOME HELP WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL GUEST 
OOH I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT BUT NOW TIME FOR A CHALLENGE INVOLVING CARS 
I WAS IN MY ELEMENT 
INSIDE BY STILTSKIN 
IT'S FAST 
IT'S VERY COMPETITIVE 
AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY A TEAM THAT'S DETERMINED TO WIN 
THE BLUE PETER TEAM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
ZOE AND I HAVE TEAMED UP WITH 
WEST SOMERSET COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
TO TAKE PART IN THE BIGGEST ELECTRIC CAR RACE IN THE COUNTRY 
IT'S THE GREENPOWER CORPORATE CHALLENGE 
RIGHT HERE AT GOODWOOD MOTOR CIRCUIT 
EACH TEAM HAS GOT TO MAKE AND DESIGN ITS OWN CAR 
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH ANDY BUT I THINK THAT WE HAVE GOT THE CAR 
TO CRUISE US RIGHT THROUGH THAT FINISH LINE 
I WAS GOING TO JOIN FOR RACE DAY 
BUT ANDY MET SCOTT OUR TEAM'S DESIGNER TO SEE HOW THE PLANS 
WERE SHAPING UP OUR TEAM HAD BEEN WORKING ON THE CAR SINCE APRIL 
WELL SCOTT HOW ARE YOU DOING GOOD YEAH 
YOU DON'T REALISE HOW EXCITED I AM ABOUT THIS 
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO RACE A CAR WHAT MAKES A GOOD ELECTRIC CAR 
IT MUST LAST A FOUR HOUR ENDURANCE RACE 
YOU HAVE TO SEE WHICH ONE WILL LAST FOUR HOURS AND GO FURTHEST O. K. 
THESE TWO BATTERIES I'M GUESSING THEY'LL POWER THE CAR 
THEY SHOULD LAST THE WHOLE RACE 
SCOTT GAVE ME THE LOW DOWN ON HOW WE'D BUILD THE CAR 
THEN IT WAS TIME TO MEET THE REST OF THE BLUE PETER RACING TEAM 
O. K. TEAM WE'VE GOT ALL THE TECHNICAL BITS SORTED 
AND NOW WE NEED TO THINK OF A COLOUR 
ANY IDEAS BLUE'S OUR SCHOOL COLOUR AND IT'S THE BLUE PETER COLOUR 
ANYTHING ELSE 
SOME GREEN WHEEL TRIMS WHY GREEN 
IT'S NOT YOUR FAVOURITE COLOUR IS IT 
IT'S A GREEN PROJECT ISN'T IT THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA 
LOGOS ON THE BONNET AND THEN TWO ON THE SIDE 
WE'VE STILL GOT SOME BITS AND PIECES TO PICK UP 
I RECKON A FEW OF US WILL GO SHOPPING WHO'S UP FOR IT 
YEAH O. K. LET'S GO 
WHEELS AND HELMETS WERE JUST A FEW OF THE SUPPLIES THAT WE NEEDED TO BUY 
BEFORE WE COULD GET STUCK IN TO MAKING OUR CAR 
ON THREE TOP TEAM ONE TWO THREE TOP TEAM WHOO 
ONCE WE HAD ALL THE MATERIALS WE NEEDED IT WAS TIME TO GET TO WORK 
AND THERE WAS LOADS TO DO 
CHRIS IS THE GROUP'S TEACHER 
AND OUR TEAM'S PROJECT MANAGER 
SCOTT DO WE JUST PUT SOME RIVETS ON THESE RIVETS ALL DOWN THE SIDE 
IN HERE ON THE INSIDE YEAH 
O. K. WE'RE JUST TURNING THE CAR ON ITS SIDE 
SO THE GLUE CAN ACTUALLY SET IN PLACE 
EVERYTHING'S TAKING SHAPE SO FAR WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT AERODYNAMICS 
ABOUT THE AIRFLOW SMOOTHLY OVER THE CAR 
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS SHOULD DO IT QUITE WELL 
I'M LIKING THE EFFORT GUYS I'M LIKING THE TEAMWORK 
THE AIR DUCT'S IN PLACE AND THIS IS HOW IT WORKS 
SO THE CAR'S GOING DOWN THE TRACK THAT WAY AND THE AIR COMES THIS WAY 
AND IS GATHERED IN HERE TO COOL DOWN THE MOTOR SO IT DOESN'T OVERHEAT 
ONCE THE CAR WAS PAINTED IT WAS TIME TO PUT THE BATTERIES IN 
PUT THIS ON 
OH GUYS WELL DONE THAT IS A CAR IT'S NOT BAD IS IT 
IT'S GOOD LET'S LEAVE THE PAINT TO DRY LET'S TEST DRIVE IT TOMORROW 
BUT BEFORE WE COULD TEST DRIVE OUR CAR 
WE HAD TO HAVE IT CHECKED BY JEREMY WAY ONE OF THE RACE ORGANISERS 
TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFE AND ROADWORTHY 
ONCE IT GOT THE ALL CLEAR I COULDN'T WAIT TO GIVE IT A BURN 
JAMES BOND THEME 
IT'S SUCH A GREAT FEELING OF ACHIEVEMENT 
THE FACT THAT THEY'VE PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER 
AND IT ACTUALLY WORKS 
I REALLY CAN'T WAIT FOR RACE DAY 
BRING IT ON BRING IT ON 
COMING UP 
THE TEST DRIVE'S GONE SMOOTHLY BUT HOW WILL WE GET ON IN THE RACE 
WE'LL SEE MORE OF THAT A LITTLE LATER ON NOW EARLY ON IN THE SHOW 
GETHIN SAID HE'D BE MAKING HIMSELF A BEACH BAG I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS 
HAVE YOU STARTED YET I'M JUST ABOUT TO 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS BEACH BAG IS IT'LL COST YOU HARDLY ANYTHING 
THE REASON FOR THAT IS IT'S MADE OUT OF RUBBISH 
ZIGGA ZIG AH 
THERE'S MY HELPER JUST ON TIME IT'S GERI HALLIWELL HI 
GERI HI 
WE'RE HIGH FIVING I WAS GOING FOR THE KISS WELL MAYBE LATER 
I'VE COME TO HELP IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU BEFORE WE CHAT 
YOU MAY KNOW GERI AS GINGER SPICE BUT BEFORE WE CHAT 
HERE'S YOUR LIFE IN A MINUTE O. K. 
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT WHAT YOU REALLY REALLY WANT 
GERI IS ONE OF THE SPICE GIRLS 
LAST YEAR THEY HAD A WORLD TOUR AND RECORDED A CHILDREN IN NEED SINGLE 
BUT THE SPICE GIRLS GO BACK EVEN FURTHER THAN THAT 
THEY ORIGINALLY GOT TOGETHER OVER TEN YEARS AGO 
POSH SCARY BABY 
SPORTY AND GINGER BECAME THE MOST SUCCESSFUL GIRL GROUP OF ALL TIME 
SELLING MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE MILLION RECORDS AND SPREADING SPICE FEVER 
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 
GOODBYE MY FRIEND 
BUT DESPITE THEIR HUGE SUCCESS AFTER TWO YEARS TOGETHER 
GERI DECIDED IT WASN'T FOR HER 
AND LEFT THE GROUP FOR A SOLO CAREER 
IT PROVED TO BE A GREAT MOVE 
IT'S RAINING MEN 
WITH FOUR NUMBER ONES IN THE U. K. CHARTS 
GINGER OR GERI THERE'S JUST NO STOPPING HER 
YEAH YOU NEVER STOP DO YOU 
YOU'VE FINISHED THE SPICE GIRLS TOUR 
AND STARTED TO WRITE ADVENTURE BOOKS FOR CHILDREN WHY DID YOU DO THAT 
WELL I WROTE THESE BOOKS ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO ABOUT UGENIA LAVENDER 
SHE'S A GIRL SHE'S GOT GIRL POWER 
AND I THOUGHT IT'D BE NICE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT LITTLE GIRL 
THAT GIRLS COULD IDENTIFY WITH 
BECAUSE THERE'S HORRID HENRY FOR THE BOYS 
AND THERE ARE FLOWER FAIRIES THAT ARE QUITE PINK 
SO UGENIA IS IN THE MIDDLE IS THERE A BIT OF GERI IN UGENIA 
A LITTLE BIT SHE'S KIND OF CHEEKY AND FUNNY SHE'S A BIT NAUGHTY 
HER BEST FRIEND RUDI 
YEAH LOOKS A BIT LIKE ANDY REALLY YEAH JUST A LITTLE BIT 
YOU'RE IN THERE AND HER TEACHER HAS GOT A WELSH ACCENT

O. K. GERI ARE YOU GOING TO HELP START MAKING A BEACH BAG TODAY YES 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS MADE OF I'VE NO IDEA GETHIN 
I THINK THE WELSH ACCENT'S GOING TO STAY ISN'T IT 
IT IS IT'S MADE OUT OF A. MILK

THAT'S HOW IT STARTS ITS LIFE WASH THEM YOU PROBABLY NEED A FEW 
DO OR YOU'LL HAVE A STINKY MILK BAG PEOPLE'LL GIVE YOU FUNNY LOOKS 
YES O. K. WHAT WE'VE DONE IS MARK IT OUT AT THE BOTTOM O. K. 
CUT SOME SQUARES OUT AS BIG AS YOU CAN 
AND YOUR BAG WILL BE NICE AND BIG ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT 
YOU NEED TO MAKE SOME MARKINGS ON YOUR SQUARES 
THERE AND CUT YOUR HOLES OUT VERY GOOD 
I'VE ALREADY STARTED AS WE HAVE NO TIME HAVE YOU GOT A PUNCH THERE 
AND PUNCH OUT THE OTHER HOLES DO YOU LIKE MAKING THINGS 
I LOVE MAKING THINGS IT'S SO MUCH FUN TO BE CREATIVE 
ACTUALLY RUDI MAKES UGENIA'S BEST FRIEND MAKES A VISION BOARD 
AND THAT'S VERY CREATIVE IT'S WHERE YOU PUT 
ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT ON TO ONE PIECE OF PAPER 
GOOD IDEA 
LAST ONE DONE THAT NEEDS A BIT OF STRENGTH 
IT DOES IT DOES YOU MAY NEED SOME HELP 
I'VE PREPARED SOME STUFF FOR YOU GRAB THE FIRST BLOCK OF SQUARES 
WITH MASKING TAPE MASKING TAPE 
THAT KEEPS THEM ALL TOGETHER RIGHT 
WE'LL TAKE THEM OFF AT THE END O. K. 
WE NEED TO FINISH STICKING THOSE ON 
YOU DO THAT VERY WELL I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT MAKING THINGS 
BUT IT'S GOOD TO TRY AND TO WORK AS A TEAM 
RIGHT WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING YES GREAT 
CO OPERATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO YOU 
BY GERI AND GETHIN HAVE YOU DONE THAT I'M DONE 
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT THOSE ON SORRY 
TOO BUSY CHATTING BUT IT'S FUN ABSOLUTELY 
WE'VE DONE THAT COS THE NEXT STAGE 
IS PUTTING THESE BAG TIES IN THE APPROPRIATE HOLES O. K. 
THESE ARE FOR KEEPING FOOD FRESH YEAH SO THEY COME IN WHITE 
YOU COULD USE RIBBON OR STRING TOO 
TO MAKE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT BAGS 
YOU'LL FIND THESE IN THE KITCHEN GOT THE IDEA I'VE GOT IT 
BUT THE NEXT STAGE 
LOOK BEHIND YOU IS GET THAT ONE OUT IT'S THIS BIT 
WE HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH TIME IT'S ONE 
I PREPARED EARLIER

EVERYONE'S GONNA WANT ONE OF THESE WE HOPE SO 
WE'LL DO THE BASE AND HANDLES LATER FOR NOW THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME 
LIKE IT AND 
THAT'S ONE OF YOUR BEST YET IT'S GONNA BE 
JUST WAIT GERI HAVE YOU GOT A FAVOURITE WEIRD ANIMAL 
STRANGE QUESTION I MET A SEAL LAST MONTH IT GAVE ME A KISS 
IT MADE A VERY STRANGE NOISE AND IT WAS UGLY 
YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE CUTE IT WENT URR URR THAT'S WEIRD 
NOW WE'VE REACHED W. ON OUR A Z. OF WEIRD ANIMALS 
THIS ANIMAL IS ONE OF OUR WEIRDEST YET 
PLANET EARTH IS AROUND SEVENTY PER CENT WATER 
AN ENVIRONMENT THAT'S HOME TO MANY DIFFERENT CREATURES 
SOME LIVE SO FAR DOWN IT'S TOO DARK FOR THE HUMAN EYE TO SEE 
AND THEY DON'T COME MUCH WEIRDER THAN THIS 
W. IS FOR THE WINTERIA 
ALSO KNOWN AS THE BARRELEYE OR SPOOKFISH 
THE WINTERIA LURKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DEEPEST OCEANS 
ALONG WITH THIS BIZARRE BUNCH 
OVER A MILE UNDERWATER THERE'S SO LITTLE LIGHT 
THAT OUR EYES JUST CAN'T SEE 
BUT OTHERS CAN 
HERE BEING ABLE TO SEE AND NOT BE SEEN IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY SOME OF THESE FRIENDLY CHAPS 
THIS IS WHERE THE WINTERIA'S SPECTACULAR EYESIGHT COMES IN 
THEIR OVERSIZED LENSES 
ARE INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE TO LIGHT 
THEY LOOK UP TOWARDS THE SURFACE WHERE THEY CAN PICK OUT THEIR PREY 
SILHOUETTED BY THE FAINTEST BEAMS FROM THE SUN 
SOME PREY FISH HAVE EVOLVED LIGHT PRODUCING CELLS ON THEIR BELLY 
WHICH BREAK UP THEIR SURFACE AND MAKE THEM ALMOST INVISIBLE 
FROM BELOW 
LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT MANY OF THE CREATURES THAT INHABIT THE ABYSS 
IN FACT NEW SPECIES ARE BEING DISCOVERED ALL THE TIME 
UNFORTUNATELY AS THEY LIVE SO FAR DOWN 
I'LL NEVER REACH THEM AS A SCUBA DIVER 
ESPECIALLY NOT IN A TRAINING POOL 
SO WHERE WILL THE WINTERIA GO ON OUR WALL OF WEIRD 
IS IT AN URGHH OR AN AHH 
WELL I LIKE TO GO ON FACE VALUE 
AND THIS CREATURE'S A BIT UGLY 
SO I'M PUTTING IT IN THE URGHH SECTION 
WELL WE'VE GOT THREE LETTERS TO GO 
KEEP WATCHING TO FIND OUT WHAT THOSE ANIMALS ARE BEFORE I FORGET 
YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ONE OF THESE 
IT'S A FACT SHEET FOR ALL THE ANIMALS WE'VE COVERED 
YOU COULD BUILD A COLLECTION 
NOW IT'S THE PART OF THE SHOW WHERE WE READ OUT YOUR LETTERS 
SHALL WE ASK OUR GUEST TO HELP 
GERI WOULD YOU HELP ME ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN READ THAT ONE O. K. 
THE GUYS HAVE BEEN GETTING INVOLVED IN RECYCLING FASHION WE LOVE THAT 
WE'VE GOT THIS LETTER FROM MOLLY ESME AND ANNIE FROM PETERBOROUGH 
THEY SPENT THEIR EASTER HOLIDAYS MAKING DRESSES AND BAGS FROM RUBBISH 
THE DRESSES FROM CARRIER BAGS AND NEWSPAPERS

BASICALLY THEY'VE TAKEN AN OLD SCHOOL UNIFORM 
AND PUT LITTLE DENIM POCKETS ON IT A GOLD STAR 
AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT AT THE BACK
