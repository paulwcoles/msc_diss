TONIGHT ONE SMALL STUMBLE FOR MAN 
AS WE BUILD A SPACE SHUTTLE 
I DRIVE A NUCLEAR BOMB DISGUISED AS A MERCEDES 
AND SIMON PEGG MAKES A HOT FUZZ IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
HELP 
YOU'RE WRONG YOU'RE WRONG 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO AN ARGUMENT 
YOU SEE THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF PETROLHEAD 
YOU'VE GOT IDIOTS LIKE THIS WHO LIKE THE PORSCHE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
THEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO'D RATHER HAVE ANTHRAX THAN A NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
COS I'M A FERRARI PERSON 
WHEN YOU OWNED A FERRARI YOU COULDN'T LEAVE IT ON THE STREET 
OR GO OUT FOR DINNER COS YOU SPENT THE WHOLE MEAL 
WORRYING ABOUT WHO WAS BUMPING IT OR CARVING ON IT TRUE 
I LEFT THE ROOF OFF AND IT WAS SO FULL OF PHLEGM YOU COULD'VE SWUM HOME BUT EXACTLY THEREFORE 
AND WHEN YOU WERE EVENTUALLY BRAVE ENOUGH TO USE IT 
BY THAT TIME THE BATTERY WAS FLAT IT WAS HOPELESS I KNOW 
BUT A FERRARI WITH A FLAT BATTERY IS AN AESTHETIC THING 
YOU CAN ENJOY LOOKING AT IT BUT IT'S NOT MOVING THAT'S WHY I LOVE THE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
BECAUSE YOU CAN USE IT EVERY DAY TO GO TO PLACES IT'S A CAR 
AND NOW THERE'S A NEW TURBO VERSION WHICH WE ASKED HIM TO DRIVE 
IN THE HOPE HE'D SEE THE LIGHT 
THIS IS THE BIGGEST NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN TURBO THEY'VE EVER MADE 
BUT IT'S STILL NO LONGER THAN A TOYOTA PRIUS 
NO WIDER THAN A THREE SERIES B. M. W. 
AND UNLIKE A NORMAL SUPERCAR IT DOESN'T HAVE MARILYN MONROE HIPS 
SO IT DOESN'T GET STUCK IN MULTISTOREY CAR PARKS 
WHAT'S MORE 
IT'S NOT LIKE THREADING THROUGH TRAFFIC IN A POSTBOX 
IN A FERRARI YOU CAN'T SEE WHERE BUSES ARE SO YOU CAN'T CARVE THEM UP BUT IN THIS 
YOU CAN 
IN A FERRARI YOU'D BE FOREVER WORRIED ABOUT GRAUNCHING THE NOSE ON A SPEED HUMP 
BUT NOT IN THE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
AND IT DOESN'T EVEN HARM THE SKY VERY MUCH EITHER 
IT MAY HAVE A FLAT SIX 
TWIN TURBO ENGINE 
BUT IT ONLY PRODUCES THREE HUNDRED CARBON DIOXIDES 
THAT'S ONE HUNDRED LESS THAN YOU GET FROM THE BACK OF A FERRARI FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY 
IF YOU DRIVE THIS CAR THROUGH A REALLY POLLUTED CITY LOS ANGELES 
CALCUTTA HARROGATE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THE GAS COMING OUT OF THE EXHAUST PIPES IS LESS TOXIC 
THAN THE AIR GOING INTO THE ENGINE 
AND I'M NOT JOKING THAT'S TRUE 
THIS THEN IS LIKE A SMALL EFFICIENT EASY TO USE VACUUM CLEANER 
THEY SHOULD'VE CALLED IT THE PORSCHE DYSON 
AND IT'LL SUCK UP YOUR LUGGAGE TOO 
BECAUSE UNLIKE ANY OTHER SUPERCAR ITS BOOT IS EASILY BIG ENOUGH 
FOR THE WEEKLY SHOP 
THERE IS THE PEACH AND PEACOCK 
THE CORNERSTONE OF ANY PORSCHE DRIVER'S SUNDAY LUNCH 
AND THERE'S STILL ROOM LEFT OVER FOR THE ICE CREAM 
MADE FROM THE BONES OF YOUR DEFEATED SQUASH OPPONENT 
AND YOU CAN USE THIS CAR ON THE SCHOOL RUN 
BECAUSE IT HAS BACK SEATS 
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE FAIRLY THIN CHILDREN 
BUT THEN YOU WOULD HAVE 
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A PORSCHE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN SO YOU'D HAVE A THIN WIFE 
I WILL CONCEDE THEN THAT THERE'S NO EVERYDAY SITUATION 
THAT FLUMMOXES A NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN TURBO 
AND SO BECAUSE YOU CAN USE IT EVERY DAY 
ITS BATTERY WON'T BE FLAT WHEN THE MOMENT IS RIGHT 
AND YOU FANCY A DRIVE 
THE NEW NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN TURBO HAS SPECIAL VARIABLE VEINED TURBO CHARGERS 
THAT ALWAYS WORK WHATEVER THE REVS 
YOU CAN EVEN BUY A SPECIAL OVER BOOST FACILITY 
WHICH FOR BRIEF MOMENTS CAN DELIVER FIVE HUNDRED TORQUES 
AND IT'S GOT A SPECIAL NEW FOUR WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEM 
THAT DOESN'T ALLOW ANY FORM OF UNDER OR OVERSTEER 
YOU JUST GET SO MUCH GRIP THAT YOUR EYES START TO HURT 
IT'S LIKE BEING IN A CAPSULE OF SPEED 
SO 
WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN 
YOU CAN REALLY GET CRACKING 
O. K. LET'S ENGAGE 
THE STABILITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 
AND PUT IT IN SPORT MODE 
THAT'S CHANGED THINGS A BIT 
NOW EVERY TIME I TURN THE STEERING WHEEL 
IT FEELS LIKE I'M DRAWING A LINE THROUGH THE LAWS OF PHYSICS 
THIS IS NOT DRIVING 
THIS IS PURE MATHS 
SO HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO MY BELOVED FERRARI 
WELL IT HAS A SMALLER ENGINE 
BUT BECAUSE OF THE SCRAM JET TURBO CHARGERS 
IT PRODUCES FOUR EIGHTY B. H. P. 
EXACTLY WHAT YOU GET FROM THE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY 
BUT THIS IS LIGHTER THAN THE FERRARI 
THANKS TO ALUMINIUM DOORS WHICH WEIGH JUST ELEVEN K. G. EACH 
IT'S ALSO TWENTY THOUSAND LESS EXPENSIVE 
SURE IT ISN'T AS EXCITING AS THE FERRARI 
IT'S MORE ABOUT ENGINEERING THAN PASSION 
BUT I WILL ADMIT THE END RESULTS ARE ASTONISHING 
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME PERFORMANCE FIGURES ZERO TO SIXTY THIRTY NINE SECONDS 
TOP SPEED NEAR AS MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TWO HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR 
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE O. K. FORTY TO SIXTY IN SECOND GEAR 
ONE SECOND ONE 
IT'S AMAZING 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST MORE USABLE THAN A FERRARI MORE PRACTICAL 
BUT I THINK OUT HERE IN THE REAL WORLD WITH CRESTS AND DIPS 
AND BUMPS AND BLIND BROWS I THINK IT'S FASTER AS WELL 
I REALLY DO 
AH YOU SEE 
LADIES LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
WE MUST ALL REJOICE BECAUSE CLARKSON HAS FINALLY CAUGHT THE BUG 
NO I HAVEN'T I STILL PREFER THE FERRARI 
HANG ON YOU'VE SPENT THE LAST SIX MINUTES WASTING OUR TIME TELLING US THAT IT'S FASTER 
MORE POWERFUL LIGHTER AND MORE PRACTICAL AND CHEAPER 
IT IS NO I'M SORRY THAT'S LIKE SITTING IN A V. W. BEETLE WITH MUSTARD UP ITS BOTTOM 
WELL IT'S BETTER THAN SITTING IN A CAR THAT WON'T START COS IT LOOKS A BIT PRETTY 
CAN I SAY THIS ARGUMENT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR FORTY YEARS 
IT WILL GO ON FOR ANOTHER FORTY 
THE CORRECT PLACE IS IN THE PUB SO WE WILL DO THE NEWS 
NO I'VE JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING ELSE O. K. 
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE I HAVE PASSION FOR THE FERRARI 
I RESPECT THAT BUT IT'S LIKE DAVID ATTENBOROUGH I RESPECT DAVID ATTENBOROUGH 
INFINITE RESPECT IN THE SAME WAY AS I RESPECT THAT CAR BUT I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO HIM 
YEAH BUT 
BUT I HAVE RESPECT AND PASSION FOR THE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
THERE YOU ARE YOU'VE JUST ADMITTED ON TELEVISION YOU WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO DAVID ATTENBOROUGH 
HE'S JUST SAID IT 
YOUR LOGIC SOMETIMES MATE IS THE MOST WARPED THING 
SHUT UP O. K. 
WE SHALL DO THE NEWS 
RIGHT 
AND NOW THE NEWS AND WE BEGIN THIS WEEK 
OH 
WITH 
WITH 
WITH THE PORSCHE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
MORE SPECIFICALLY 
THE PORSCHE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN G. T. THREE R. S. 
OH NOW THAT IS THE BUSINESS IT'S FASTER LIGHTER IT'S TAUTER 
IT'S POSSIBLY THE ULTIMATE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
AND EBOLA IS THE ULTIMATE TROPICAL DISEASE LOOK AT THAT SCAFFOLDING 
IT'S A ROLL CAGE 
I'M SORRY IF I SEE SCAFFOLDING ROUND A BUILDING I THINK IT'S NOT FINISHED 
NO IT'S A ROLL CAGE 
LOOK I WILL ADMIT PERHAPS THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS OTHERWISE BRILLIANT CAR 
IT'S NOT THE MOST PRACTICAL IF YOU WANT TO GO TO THE NEWSPAPER SHOP 
YOU HAVE TO CLAMBER OVER THE ROLLCAGE 
LOWER YOURSELF INTO THE SEAT DO UP THE SIX POINT HARNESS PRIME THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER IT'LL TAKE TIME 
SO IN THE REAL WORLD MY TWELVE L. PANDA IS FASTER TO THE SHOPS 
NO MATE IT'S NOT NO IT IS I ONLY HAVE TO PUT THE SEATBELT ON ONCE YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT SIX TIMES 
AND THEN WAIT WHILST YOU DO ALL YOUR PRE FLIGHT CHECKS TO MAKE SURE THE AIR VENTS ARE ALL 
CAN I MOVE THIS ALONG DO YOU MIND 
I'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT'S BUGGING ME THESE AVERAGE SPEED CAMERAS 
I WAS FLYING ALONG THE M. TWENTY FIVE THROUGH THE ROADWORKS YOU HAD TO DO AN AVERAGE OF FORTY M. P. H. 
MEASURED BY TWO CAMERAS ONE AT THE START ONE AT THE END 
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
YOU'RE DRIVING ROUND AND YOU THINK OH GOD I'M DOING FORTY TWO COS IT'S DOWNHILL 
SO YOU'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR HALF A MILE SO NOW YOU NEED TO DO HALF A MILE AT THIRTY EIGHT 
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU CAN ONLY LOOK AT THE SPEEDOMETER NOTHING ELSE 
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH ROADWORKS ON THE M. TWENTY FIVE IN THE RAIN AT RUSH HOUR 
I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING HERE IT'S THE GOVERNMENT GORDON BROWN HAS WORKED OUT 
HE'S GOT TO PAY OUR PENSIONS COS WE'RE GONNA LIVE FOREVER 
THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL US OFF 
BUT I KNOW HOW TO GET ROUND IT 
GO PAST THE FIRST CAMERA PULL OVER GET THE NEWSPAPER OUT READ IT 
LISTEN TO THE RADIO FOR TEN MINUTES DO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOR THE REST OF THE WAY 
THAT'S NOT RIGHT ACTUALLY I CAN PROVE THAT THE WAY TO KEEP TRAFFIC MOVING THROUGH ROADWORKS 
WHICH IS WHERE THOSE AVERAGE SPEED CAMERAS ARE YEAH IS FOR EVERYBODY TO GO FASTER 
IT'S ALL DOWN TO THE WORK OF THE SWISS PHYSICIST DANIEL BERNOULLI YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH HIM 
OH HIM THOUGHT SO HE ISN'T 
HE'S NEVER HEARD OF HIM 
WHAT HE ESSENTIALLY PROVED IS THAT IN A SYSTEM 
PRESSURE AND VOLUME MULTIPLIED TOGETHER MUST BE A CONSTANT 
SO IF YOU HAVE A BUSY MOTORWAY AND IT GETS THINNER THEY MUST GO FASTER FOR THE FLOW RATE OF THE CARS 
TO REMAIN THE SAME LIKE PUTTING YOUR THUMB OVER THE END OF A HOSE 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S LIKE 
SO IF YOU TAKE A THREE LANE MOTORWAY TO ONE LANE HOW FAST DOES THE TRAFFIC HAVE TO MOVE 
IN ORDER TO KEEP THE FLOW RATE THE SAME 
WELL THE FORMULA WOULD BE VN WOULD BE LO DIVIDED BY L. R. X. VE 
SO HOW FAST WHICH IS TWO HUNDRED TEN 
TWO TEN M. P. H. WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN FAIR ENOUGH 
ALL BUY BUGATTIS AND ZONDAS TO CURE CONGESTION 
NOW THE BIG NEWS OCCUPYING ALL THE BULLETINS 
IS THAT FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED THIS PETITION 
PROTESTING ABOUT THE PLANS TO IMPLEMENT ROAD CHARGING YOU KNOW PAY AS YOU GO STUFF 
IF YOU WANT TO ADD YOUR NAME TO THAT PETITION HERE IS THE ADDRESS 
O. K. 
THAT'S THE ADDRESS OBVIOUSLY THIS BEING THE B. B. C. 
IF YOU THINK ROAD PRICING'S A GOOD IDEA AND WANT TO REGISTER YOUR THOUGHTS 
THERE'S A WEBSITE TOO 
THERE IT IS 
BEST OF LUCK WITH THAT 
THE MITSUBISHI EVO WE LOVE THAT CAR IT'S A GREAT CAR 
THIS IS THE NEW ONE THE EVO X. THIS IS WHAT IT'LL PROBABLY LOOK LIKE 
THEY'VE LOADED IT WITH LOADS OF TECHNOLOGY 
IT'S GOT ALL THESE INITIALS A. C. D. GOOD AYC GOOD A. S. C. SAWC M. M. M. 
MIVEC KEEP TALKING TO ME LIKE THAT 
IF IT'S GOT ALL THE TECHNOLOGY AND IT LOOKS AS GOOD AS THAT OH 
WHY DO YOU NEED SUPERCARS YEAH WHY IF IT LOOKS LIKE THAT 
THERE IS A SLIGHT WARNING ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE CARS BECAUSE OF ALL THAT TECHNOLOGY 
THEY GO BEYOND FLATTERING YOU AS A DRIVER IT'S A BIT LIKE AN AUTOMATIC PIANO 
WHERE YOU PLAY THEN TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF AND IT CARRIES ON PLAYING 
THERE'S A DANGER THE CAR'S LIKE THAT IF YOU'VE GOT PASSENGERS WITH YOU THINKING YOU'RE A BRILLIANT DRIVER 
DON'T TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL IT WILL KEEP GOING AND YOU'LL LOOK AN IDIOT 
A COUPLE OF TIMES RECENTLY ON THE PROGRAMME 
WE'VE SAID THERE WON'T BE A CAR TO BEAT THE BUGATTI VEYRON IN OUR LIFETIME 
IT'S THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERING 
TURNS OUT WE MIGHT'VE BEEN WRONG LOOK AT THIS 
THIS IS CALLED THE MELLING HELLCAT I'VE GOT SOME FIGURES FOR YOU 
IT'S GOT A SIX L. QUAD TURBO V. TEN 
ONE ONE SEVENTY FIVE B. H. P. 
AND A TOP SPEED THEY'RE SAYING OF TWO SEVENTY M. P. H. 
OH RUBBISH WHAT THAT'S RUBBISH 
I BET YOU THAT'S NOT SLIPPERY ENOUGH 
YOU MEAN NOT AERODYNAMIC ENOUGH CAN YOU PLEASE NOT ASK ME TO BE THE ONE TO FIND OUT 
I JUST DON'T FANCY IT HEY LAST WEEK DID YOU SEE THE AMERICAN PROGRAMME LAST WEEK 
YES 
YOU KNOW WE GOT INTO A SPOT OF BOTHER IN A PETROL STATION IN ALABAMA 
WE MISSED A TRICK WHEN THAT WOMAN SAID ARE YOU GAY OR LOOKIN' TO GET BEAT UP IN A HICK TOWN 
AND I SAID NO I'M MARRIED WITH THREE CHILDREN IF ONLY YOU'D SAID YOU WERE MARRIED WITH TWO CHILDREN 
WE COULD'VE JUST POINTED AT BACHELOR BOY HERE 
THE ONE WITH LONG HAIR EXACTLY WATCH THEM KICK THE SNOT OUT OF HIM 
CHAPS 
NEWS FROM THE B. B. C. 
IF YOU'RE A B. B. C. EMPLOYEE AND YOU DRIVE FLEET CARS OR HIRE CARS 
YOU'VE NOW GOT TO GO ON A SAFE DRIVING PROGRAM 
WELL WE DRIVE THOSE DO WE HAVE TO YES WE DO 
NO WAY I'M NOT KIDDING IT SAYS HERE 
DRIVING IS NOW ACKNOWLEDGED AS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS WORK RELATED HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES 
IT ISN'T 
IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT'S MORE COMFORTABLE THAN WALKING 
THE B. B. C. IS COMMITTED IN REDUCING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACTIVITY 
THEY'RE MAKING IT SOUND LIKE MASTURBATION 
STOP DRIVING YOU'LL GO BLIND EXACTLY 
I'VE GOT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE 
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS B. B. C. EMPLOYEES HAVE TO FACE WE'LL BRING THEM UP ON THE SCREEN 
YOU HAVE A BLOW OUT ON THE MOTORWAY ONE FOR YOU HAMMOND 
WHAT INSTINCTIVE REACTION 
SHOULD YOU AVOID 
ACCELERATING WHAT AS IF MY TYRE'S GONE BRRR 
THIS IS INSTINCTIVE REACTIONS 
TAKING YOUR HANDS OFF THE STEERING WHEEL THAT'LL HELP 
THEY'RE MANIACS I'M SO IRRITATED BY THIS I CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
EXCEEDING THE SPEED LIMIT IN A BUILT UP AREA IS ACCEPTABLE 
IN VEHICLES FITTED WITH ANTI LOCK BRAKING SYSTEMS 
DO YOU STRONGLY DISAGREE DISAGREE OR STRONGLY AGREE 
IT'S NOT GONNA BE AN EXCUSE IS IT 
YEAH OFFICER IT'S O. K. I WAS DOING ONE HUNDRED TEN IN THE VILLAGE I HAVE A. B. S. 
YEAH NO TICKET FOR ME WHY ARE YOU LOOKING ANGRY AT ME 
WHAT'S THE PRIMARY HAZARD FACING DRIVERS WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT 
ANYONE WANT TO GUESS AT THAT 
HANG ON YEAH WHAT 
THE DARK 
ANYTHING ELSE 
GERMANS GERMANS THESE ARE ALL VALID POINTS 
NONE OF THESE THINGS ARE ON MY LIST ANYBODY ELSE GOT ANY THOUGHTS 
PEASANTS PEASANTS 
NO IT'S GLARE FROM OTHER VEHICLE'S HEAD LIGHTS 
CYCLISTS IN DARK CLOTHING THAT'S THEIR OWN FAULT 
FOR NOT WORKING HARD ENOUGH AND HAVING A CAR FATIGUE AND STAYING ALERT 
THAT NOW MEANS YOU MUST SPEND TWENTY MINUTES NEXT WEEK FAILING THE TEST THEN GOING ON A COURSE 
SO SORRY WE WON'T BE HERE NEXT WEEK BUT WE'LL BE SAFER DRIVERS WHEN WE GET BACK 
NOW HERE ON TOP GEAR WE LIKE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE 
WE'VE MADE AMPHIBIOUS CARS WE'VE MADE A CONVERTIBLE PEOPLE CARRIER 
BUT NOW TIME TO SEE IF WE CAN CONQUER THE FINAL FRONTIER 
SPACE 
NO WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO 
NO WE WANTED TO FIND OUT IF YOU CAN MAKE A CAR INTO A SPACESHIP YES 
AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE SINGLE STUPIDEST IDEA 
I'D EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE AND REFUSED TO HAVE ANY PART IN IT 
AH BUT YOU'D UNDERESTIMATED THE GENIUS OF OUR SPACE BASED PLAN 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH SPACE ROCKETS 
IS THAT THEY'RE JOLLY EXPENSIVE THE SUPER POWERS 
SPEND BILLIONS TRYING TO GET THEIR HARDWARE UP AMONGST THE STARS 
BUT WE THOUGHT YOU COULD DO IT FOR A LOT LESS CASH 
IF YOU BASED YOUR SPACE ROCKET ON A CAR 
THAT MEANT GETTING HOLD OF THE MOST ROCKET SHAPED CAR WE COULD THINK OF 
YES IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR THIRTY YEARS AND FOR TWENTY NINE OF THOSE YEARS 
IT'S BEEN A COMPLETE JOKE 
NOW THOUGH WE'RE GONNA SEE 
IF THE RELIANT ROBIN HAS THE MAKINGS OF A SPACESHIP 
IT'S LIGHT IT'S CHEAP 
AND IT TAPERS TO A POINT LIKE A ROCKET 
SO WE'RE ALREADY HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA STRAP ROCKETS TO IT SET IT OFF AND WAVE IT GOODBYE 
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA SEE 
IF WE CAN TURN IT INTO THE MOST DIFFICULT OF ALL SPACECRAFT 
THE ONE THAT HAS TO TAKE OFF AND BE USED AGAIN 
A SPACE SHUTTLE 
IF YOU'RE EIGHT 
YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT 
OUR FIRST JOB WAS TO PUT A CALL IN TO THE ROCKETEERS 
THESE WERE THE MEN WHO HELPED TO SEND A MINI DOWN A SKI JUMP 
FOR THE TOP GEAR WINTER OLYMPICS 
THREE TWO ONE INITIATE 
JAMES AND I CONVENED A MEETING AT THEIR HEADQUARTERS 
JUST OUTSIDE THE DERBYSHIRE TOWN OF GLOSSOP 
IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTRE IS IT 
OH I DUNNO 
INSIDE WE'D ASSEMBLED A MOTLEY CREW 
OF BOFFINS 
RIGHT GENTLEMEN WHAT WE WANT FROM YOU IS THE MOST DIFFICULT KIND OF SPACE ROCKET 
A SPACE SHUTTLE 
THIS HAS TO WORK PROPERLY 
IT HAS TO HAVE THE BIG FUEL TANK THE BOOSTER ROCKETS 
THEY ALL HAVE TO SEPARATE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE WANT TO BRING IT DOWN 
UNDER CONTROL TO A LANDING 
AND IT'S WORTH SAYING THAT NO ONE IS GOING TO GO IN THIS 
BUT IT HAS TO BE LANDED 
THE IDEA IS WE SEND IT UP A FEW THOUSAND FEET 
WE'RE TESTING THE PRINCIPLE IF YOU CAN MAKE THIS WORK AND BRING IT INTO THIS CONTROLLED LANDING 
WE WILL PROBABLY GET FUNDING FROM THE E. U. FOR A PROPER SPACE MISSION 
SO YOU WANT TO LAUNCH IT JETTISON THE S. R. B. JETTISON THE ORBITER 
AND FLY IT DOWN 
WHAT'S THE ORBITER THE RELIANT RIGHT 
HAVE YOU GOT A SPARE BILLION DOLLARS THOUGH 
NO THAT'S WHY WE'VE COME TO YOU YOU'RE FROM MANCHESTER AND YOU CAN DO IT FOR TEN AND SIX 
THERE'LL BE AS MUCH TEA AS YOU CAN DRINK CHIPS IN LARD ANYTHING 
THE ROCKET MEN DID SOME CALCULATIONS ON THE BACK OF A LAPTOP 
HOW DO WE MAKE THIS BLOODY THING WORK WELL WE HAVE THE ROBIN 
THAT'S A STARTING POINT WHOOPEE WE'VE GOT A ROBIN 
AN HOUR LATER AND IT LOOKS AS IF JEREMY MAY HAVE HAD A POINT 
IT IS DIFFICULT IN EVERY SINGLE WAY RIGHT 
YOU'VE GOT A RELIANT ROBIN IT'S A CAR SO IT'S REALLY HEAVY 
YEAH SO ROUGH NUMBERS 
WE'RE GONNA NEED TWELVE TIMES THE POWER THAT THE MINI HAD 
REALLY 
IT'S THE LARGEST NON COMMERCIAL ROCKET LAUNCHED IN EUROPE 
IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL NON COMMERCIAL ROCKET LAUNCHED IN EUROPE RIGHT 
AS A ROCKET IT'S THE MOST AWFUL SHAPE IT COULD EVER BE 
I THOUGHT THE ROBIN WAS A GOOD PLACE TO START BECAUSE 
IT'S POINTY AT ONE END 
THAT'S AS FAR AS WE GOT WITH THAT 
IT'S POINTY YES 
NEVERTHELESS THEY SET TO WORK WITH JAMES IN TOW 
WHILE MAY WAS IN HIS ELEMENT IN THE WORLD'S BIGGEST ALLOTMENT SHED 
LOOK AT THAT 
I WAS TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW TO LAND A RELIANT ROBIN 
IF ROCKETS ARE DEPLOYED 
I WRESTLED WITH THE PROBLEM FOR AGES BEFORE I HAD A BRAINWAVE 
HELLO IS THAT MODEL AEROPLANE MONTHLY 
GREAT I NEED SOME HELP 
THIS I THINK IS THE ANSWER IF IN A MORE POWERFUL VERSION 
WELL WHATEVER THIS IS TO OUR SPACE SHUTTLE 
AND WE CAN TAKE CONTROL OF IT FROM THE GROUND AFTER IT'S JETTISONED ITS ROCKETS AND FLY IT IN BY REMOTE 
IT'S A GOOD PLAN JUST HAVE TO GET GOOD AT FLYING 
I THOUGHT IT BEST TO SACK MYSELF FROM THIS JOB 
AND INSTEAD HIRED STEVE HOLLAND A CHAMPION MODEL AEROPLANE PILOT 
THAT IS MORE LIKE IT STEVE 
HOW ARE YOU AT FLYING CARS 
CARS SMALL CARS 
WITH STEVE THE PILOT ON BOARD I WENT BACK TO CHECK ON JAMES'S BUILD 
AND I WAS IN FOR A SHOCK 
BLOODY HELL JAMES 
IT'S ENORMOUS 
THAT'S A SOLID ROCKET BOOSTER THERE ARE TWO OF THOSE 
THAT HASN'T EVEN GOT ITS NOSE CONE ON YET 
I WAS THINKING FIREWORK ON A STICK 
SO WAS I BUT THAT ISN'T THE BIGGEST BIT 
NO THE EXTERNAL FUEL TANK WAS THE BIGGEST BIT COMPLETE WITH EXTRA 
ROCKETS IN THE BOTTOM AND THEN MORE ROCKETS IN THE RELIANT 
AND EXPLOSIVE BOLTS TO SEPARATE EVERYTHING 
THE WHOLE CONSTRUCTION WAS MIND BOGGLINGLY COMPLICATED 
WHAT OCCURS TO ME NOW IS THE LIST OF THINGS TO GO WRONG 
IS ENORMOUS YEAH 
IF ANY ONE OF THEM GOES WRONG I'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT THE LANDING 
THE CHANCES OF GETTING AS FAR AS THE LANDING ON THE DAY ARE NOW 
HOW DID YOU GET ON WITH YOUR FLYING BY THE WAY GOOD 
THE NEXT PROBLEM WAS A BIGGIE THE ROCKETEERS WERE WORRIED 
THAT BECAUSE OF THE ROBIN'S ODD SHAPE THE WHOLE SHUTTLE 
WOULD SPEAR OFF COURSE DURING THE ASCENT 
WE'RE HAPPY WE'VE GOT THE POWER 
YES EIGHT TONNES OF THRUST AND THE THING ONLY WEIGHS ONE AND A HALF 
SO IT'S GONNA GO SOMEWHERE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK IS IT 
IT'S GOT TO WORK WE'RE A LONG WAY INTO IT NOW WHAT'S THAT 
IF YOU LOOK AT IT LIKE THIS IT MAKES MORE SENSE 
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T LAUNCH ITSELF IT COULD FALL ONTO ITS BACK IN THE SKY OR ANYTHING 
THIS ISN'T ABOUT POWER NOW 
THIS IS ABOUT THE SHAPE OF IT AND HOW THAT WILL AFFECT WHERE IT GOES 
WE NEED AN AERODYNAMICS EXPERT TO LOOK AT THIS STUFF 
ONE GROVELLING PHONE CALL TO THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF ENGLAND 
AND WE SECURED PERMISSION TO USE THEIR WIND TUNNEL 
AND BECAUSE IT WAS FREE WE ASSUMED IT WAS SELF SERVICE 
GO WHAT DO YOU MEAN GO I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
ER 
DO THAT 
THAT'S GOOD 
NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIED JAMES COULDN'T MAKE HIMSELF 
INTO THE SHAPE OF A RELIANT ROBIN EVEN WITH HELP 
THANKFULLY TWO EGGHEADS ARRIVED WITH THE SCALE MODEL OF OUR SHUTTLE 
YOU SEE A BEARD LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN SAFE HANDS YES 
BASICALLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANYTHING AERODYNAMIC 
THE RELIANT IS A PROBLEM AERODYNAMICALLY 
THEY DIDN'T DESIGN IT WITH THIS IN MIND 
IS THERE ANY WASH OUT OR WASH IN ON THE WINGS 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU TWO ARE SAYING 
WELL THERE IS THE AEROFOIL SECTION OF THE WING 
SO THE BIG QUESTION WILL IT FLY 
I TOOK IT FROM HIS SILENCE THAT HE HAD HIS DOUBTS 
AND HE WASN'T ALONE 
LIKE THE REAL THING OUR SHUTTLE WOULD GLIDE BACK TO EARTH WITHOUT POWER 
AND STEVE OUR PILOT HAD ALSO BUILT A MODEL TO SHOW HOW WELL IT DID THIS 
WHAT IS IT GOING TO FEEL LIKE TO FLY IT 
IT WILL COME DOWN LIKE A LIFT WITH THE CABLE CUT 
YOU'RE NOT FILLING ME WITH HOPE 
THEY LOSE ABOUT A FOOT IN HEIGHT THE ROBIN IS THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
THREE TWO ONE 
AND WHEN THE MODEL WAS RELEASED FROM ITS TOW PLANE 
IT'S PLUMMETING TO THE EARTH 
RATHER YOU THAN ME I TELL YOU 
SO THERE WERE DOUBTS ABOUT OUR SPACE SHUTTLE GOING UP AND DOUBTS ABOUT IT COMING DOWN 
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO WORRY NOW BECAUSE SHE WAS READY 
AND ON HER WAY TO THE LAUNCH SITE 
DON'T WORRY I STILL LIKE CARS I PROMISE 
WE'LL PICK UP THE LUDICROUS STORY LATER ON 
BUT NOW TIME TO PUT A STAR IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HERO OF A NEW AMERICAN HOLLYWOOD ACTION FILM 
HERE HE IS SIMON PEGG 
HOW ARE YOU GOOD TO SEE YOU HAVE A SEAT 
A SUPERSTAR 
NOW WE DON'T REALLY DO PLUGGING VERY MUCH ON THIS SHOW WE'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT IT 
I ALSO LIKE TO SAY HOW IT IS YOU KEEP IT REAL 
YES IF SOME WARBLER COMES ON WE WILL SAY YOUR RECORD IS TERRIBLE 
BUT YOUR NEW FILM HOT FUZZ MAN THAT'S FUNNY GOOD 
AS FAR AS I CAN WORK OUT THE IDEA IS TO MAKE BRITISH COPS COOL 
YES THERE'S A BIG TRADITION OF BRITISH FILMS BEING ABOUT GANGSTERS 
AND THE CRIMES IN THE WORLD BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO MAKE THEM LOOK COOL 
BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT SHOOTERS AND STUFF 
WHEREAS THE BRITISH COPS IT'S SLIGHTLY AGAINST THEM IN TERMS OF 
IT'S A TRADITIONAL FORCE 
THE UNIFORMS ONLY JUST STARTING TO GET PRACTICAL 
SO IT'S HARD TO BE COOL AND A BRITISH COP 
THE ONE THING THAT IS DIFFICULT FOR OUR POLICE FORCE IN TERMS OF THE COOLOMETER 
IS THE POINTY TALL HAT WHICH PREGNANT WOMEN ARE STILL ALLOWED TO WEE IN 
THAT'S TRUE IF THEY'RE CAUGHT SHORT IN THE TOWN CENTRE 
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO WEE IN A POLICEMAN'S HAT IF YOU'RE PREGNANT 
I CAN CLAIM THAT 
COME HERE OFFICER THANKS A LOT MATE 
SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT WE'RE ON ABOUT 
I'VE MADE SURE WE'VE GOT A CLIP OF THIS FILM GOOD 
IT'S A BIT IN THE SUPERMARKET YES 
WHEN THEY HAVE YOU HAVE A GUN FIGHT THE BATTLE OF SOMERFIELD'S 
LET'S LOOK AT THAT 
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING WE SHOULD STRIKE NOW WHILE WE'VE GOT THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE 
THE LONGER WE WAIT THE LONGER FOR THEM TO MOBILISE LET'S GO IN THROUGH THE FRONT ENTRANCE 
VERY GOOD WHAT HE SAID 
MY MY HERE COME THE FUZZ 
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT IN WAIT HERE DON'T GO IN ON YOUR OWN 
DON'T WORRY HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING 
O. K. THEY'RE IN 
YOU DEAL WITH THE STORE AND I'LL DEAL WITH THE TROLLEY BOY EH OH 
OH 
THAT IS MARVELLOUS 
NOW 
THE NEXT QUESTION I'VE GOT TO ASK DID SOMERFIELD LET YOU DO THAT 
YES THEY DID I'VE GOT MAXIMUM RESPECT FOR SOMERFIELD NOW 
WE WROTE TO THEM AND SAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A FIGHT IN ONE OF YOUR SUPERMARKETS IF YOU DON'T MIND 
IT'S ALL IN GOOD FUN MEANT WITH A GREAT AMOUNT OF AFFECTION THEY WERE ALL RIGHT 
WE'VE GOT TO GET ONTO CAR CHASES THE AMERICAN CAR TENDS TO BE REAR WHEEL DRIVE IN A POLICE CHASE 
YOU USED ASTRA DIESELS NOTHING BUT THE BEST 
THAT IS WHAT A LOT OF POLICE ARE LUMBERED WITH 
IT'S LIKE FIRE AND ICE 
THAT CHASE WOULD NEVER END UNTIL THE FUEL RAN OUT 
THERE'S NO TWO ASTRA DIESELS CHASING EACH OTHER 
IT'S LIKE THE IMMOVABLE FORCE AND THE UNSTOPPABLE OBJECT 
THE OTHER AWFUL THING ABOUT THEM YOU KNOW THOSE WORLD'S WILDEST POLICE CHASE VIDEO THINGS 
I ONCE WATCHED ONE OF THOSE IN AMERICA AND THEY SAID WE GOT A CLIP FROM ENGLAND NOW 
I THOUGHT I'M GONNA DIE OF SHAME 
SURE ENOUGH IT WENT ROUND A CORNER AND BUMPED INTO A PLANT POT 
DID YOU HAVE GUN TRAINING FOR THE FILM 
WE DID A COUPLE OF DAYS I WAS PRETTY PROFICIENT ANYWAY 
YOU WERE GUN MAN I'VE GOT A BUNCH OF WEAPONS I PACK HEAT 
WE HAD SOME AMAZING DAYS OF JUST RUNNING THROUGH WELLS TOWN CENTRE 
FIRING WINCHESTER THIRTEEN HUNDRED M. PUMP ACTION SHOTGUNS 
THIRTEEN HUNDRED M. YEAH I LIKE THE WAY YOU THROW THE MODEL NAME IN THERE 
NICK FROST CALLED IT EMMA HE WAS THAT ATTACHED TO IT 
AND WHEN WE WERE DOING SPACED HE HAD TO DISMANTLE A GUN FOR THE SHOW 
SO HE TOOK A REPLICA M. P. FIVE HOME WHICH IS A MACHINE GUN 
TOOK ALL HIS CLOTHES OFF NO 
HE STRIPPED TO THE WAIST IT WAS SUMMERTIME AND PUT A BLINDFOLD ON 
AND WAS DOING THIS TOOK THE BLINDFOLD OFF AND THERE WERE EIGHT ARMED POLICE OFFICERS 
IN THE LIVING ROOM WITH THEIR GUNS DRAWN 
AND IF NICK WENT LIKE THAT RATHER THAN LIKE THAT WHICH HE DID THEY WERE GONNA SHOOT HIM REALLY 
HE PHONED ME AFTERWARDS SIMON 
APPARENTLY HE WAS GOING I'M AN ACTOR I'M AN ACTOR 
THEY WERE WHERE'S YOUR EQUITY CARD THEY'VE CHANGED THE RULING YOU DON'T NEED ONE ANY MORE 
CAN I JUST MOVE ON COS FILMS YOU'RE A BIT OF A BUFF I AM A BIT 
STAR WARS IN PARTICULAR YEAH ABSOLUTELY 
DID YOU NOT ONCE WRITE A THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WORD ESSAY 
ON WHY YOU THOUGHT C. THREE P. O. WAS GAY 
NO NO 
I ANALYSED STAR WARS FROM A MARXIST PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF SAYING 
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS IN STAR WARS THAT ARE PRETTY RIGHT WING 
IT CAME AFTER VIETNAM IT WAS A BIG EXPRESSION OF AMERICAN WHITE MIDDLE CLASS POWER 
AND THE REJECTION OF THE OLD ORDER OF THE ENGLISH 
AND YOU COULD ARGUE THAT C. THREE P. O. WAS AN EMASCULATED HOMOSEXUAL I 
HE WAS CAMP BUT SAFE COS HE DIDN'T HAVE A WILLY SO IT WAS O. K. 
HOMOSEXUAL MAN HAVE WILLIES HE WAS SEXUALLY NON THREATENING 
GRAHAM NORTON'S GOT A WILLY HOW DO YOU KNOW 
I MUST ADMIT WHEN I WAS DOING MY LAP 
I WAS JUST WISHING I COULD HEAR THE STIG LIKE BEN KENOBI 
SLOW ROUND THE CORNER SIMON SLOW ROUND THE CORNER 
ANYWAY WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE SIMON'S LAP YEAH 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THIS TYRES SQUEAL 
NICE SLIGHT WHEEL SPIN 
THAT'S MY JOB THE COMMENTARY 
TYRES SQUEAL 
OH YEAH 
THAT WAS PLEASANT VERY PLEASANT 
PLEASANT IS NOT A WORD I'VE EVER LOOK AT THAT 
THAT WAS MY FAVOURITE BEND IT WAS SO GOOD YOU JUST KEPT IT GOING 
IN GEAR YOU 
A LEAF FROM HUGH GRANT THERE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO 
AND NICE 
THIS IS GOOD 
HELP 
THAT'S THE FIRST CRY FOR HELP WE'VE HAD THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN 
GOD IF YOU CAN NAIL THIS ONE YOU'RE LAUGHING 
NO WHERE'S THE SPEED GONE 
THAT WAS MY WORST CORNER NO OH YOU SLOWED DOWN I KNOW 
ACROSS THE LINE THERE 
IT WAS FAST THAT IT WAS ALL RIGHT 
GETS THE ADRENALIN GOING DOESN'T IT IT DOES IT WAS SO MUCH FUN 
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'VE COME 
ABOVE COOGAN 
YOU DID IT IN ONE MINUTE SO YOU'RE ABOVE JIMMY CARR 
FORTY SO ALREADY YOU'RE ABOVE COOGAN 
EIGHT POINT FIVE SO WAY ABOUT COOGAN 
NICE ONE 
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD RESULT THANK YOU 
I THINK IF I'D NAILED THAT CORNER THAT WAS THE ONE THAT BOTHERED ME 
I RECKON IF YOU'D HAVE DONE THOSE LAST TWO CORNERS AT SORT OF WHAT I CALL GAMBON SPEED 
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN UP THERE WITH GORDON RAMSAY YEAH 
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD LAP IT FELT REALLY GREAT 
WELL BEST OF LUCK WITH THE FILM THANK YOU FOR COMING 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SIMON PEGG THANK YOU THANK YOU CHEERS 
IN THE OLDEN DAYS IT WAS TERRIBLY EASY TO TUNE UP A MASS PRODUCED CAR 
YOU PUT A BIGGER CARBURETTOR ON IT 
MADE AN AIR SCOOP FOR THE BONNET OUT OF PLYWOOD AND AWAY YOU WENT 
THESE DAYS IT'S NOT QUITE SO EASY 
IT IS ESPECIALLY TRICKY IF YOU START OUT WITH THIS MERCEDES S. L. SIXTY FIVE 
FIVE SEVENTEEN B. H. P. V. TWELVE TWIN TURBO 
HOW CAN A TUNING COMPANY POSSIBLY MAKE THIS BETTER THAN IT ALREADY IS 
AND IF THEY COULD WHAT KIND OF MONSTER WOULD YOU END UP WITH 
WELL YOU'D END UP WITH THIS 
THE MOST POWERFUL CONVERTIBLE EVER MADE 
WELCOME EVERYONE TO THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND BRABUS S. BI TURBO ROADSTER 
SWEET MOTHER OF GOD THIS IS FAST 
THE SECRET TO ALL THIS SPEED OF COURSE IS THE ENGINE 
WHAT BRABUS DO IS TAKE THE STANDARD MERCEDES V. TWELVE 
AND THEN THROW ALMOST ALL OF IT AWAY 
ONLY THE CYLINDER BLOCK REMAINS AND EVEN THAT IS MODIFIED 
EVERYTHING ELSE IS NEW 
NEW AND BIGGER 
THE ORIGINAL CAR HAS FIFTY FIVE LITRES 
THIS IS A SIXTY THREE AND THE RESULT OF THAT IS DRAMATIC 
SEVEN THIRTY B. H. P. 
THAT'S MORE THAN ANY BENTLEY FERRARI MORE THAN ANY LAMBORGHINI EVEN 
OF COURSE IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT DIFFICULT TO SCREW SEVEN THIRTY B. H. P. FROM AN ENGINE 
BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO PUT ALL THAT POWER ON THE ROAD 
AND IT'S NIGH ON IMPOSSIBLE WHEN THE ENGINE IS CHURNING OUT 
AN ALMOST RIDICULOUS ONE THOUSAND TORQUES 
ONE THOUSAND TORQUES IS WHAT YOU'D USE FOR RESTARTING A DEAD PLANET 
IT'S SO MUCH THAT WHEN THEY PUT THE ENGINE IN THE CAR IT WOULDN'T MOVE AT ALL 
THE TRACTION CONTROL SAT THERE GOING THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE 
WHEN THEY TURNED THE TRACTION CONTROL OFF THE REAR WHEELS SPUN UNTIL THE TYRES BURST 
TYRES SQUEAL 
AS A RESULT THEY'VE NOW LIMITED IT TO EIGHT HUNDRED ELEVEN TORQUES 
WHICH IS ABOUT WHAT YOU'D USE TO POWER A MEDIUM SIZED AIRCRAFT CARRIER 
AT THIS POINT YOU'RE PROBABLY EXPECTING ME TO SAY THEY'VE LIMITED THE TOP SPEED AS WELL 
AND I'M AFRAID THEY HAVE 
TO TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES AN HOUR 
THE TOP SPEED IS INCREDIBLE BUT THE WAY IT GETS THERE 
BOGGLES THE MIND 
ONE HUNDRED 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
I'M NOW GOING ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
FASTER THAN THE TOP SPEED OF AN APACHE HELICOPTER GUNSHIP 
I'M RUNNING OUT OF RUNWAY 
I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO EXPLAIN AT THIS POINT 
THAT MERCEDES LIMIT THIS CAR TO ONE FIFTY FIVE M. P. H. 
BECAUSE THAT'S THE LIMIT OF WHAT VARIOUS COMPONENTS CAN TAKE 
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT GO TWO NINETEEN M. P. H. 
THOSE COMPONENTS HAVE TO BE CHANGED 
THAT DISCREET BODY KIT THEREFORE IS NOT FOR SHOW 
IT'S THERE TO KEEP ME ON THE GROUND 
WHICH IS HANDY WHEN YOU'RE DOING THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FEET A SECOND 
AND WHAT KIND OF UNDER FLOOR ENGINEERING DOES THE BRABUS HAVE 
TO KEEP IT IN CHECK AT THIS KIND OF SPEED 
WELL PUT SIMPLY IT'S ALL VERY BIG 
THE BRAKES ARE THE SIZE OF DUSTBIN LIDS AND HAVE TWELVE PISTONS EACH 
THE TYRES COULD ENCOMPASS NEPTUNE AND AT SPEED 
THE WHOLE CAR SITS LOWER TO THE ROAD THAN NORMAL BY FIFTEEN MILLIMETRES 
SO HAS IT WORKED 
NO NOT REALLY 
EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE REINED IN THE TORQUE THERE'S STILL FAR TOO MUCH OF IT 
EVERY TIME YOU GO NEAR THE THROTTLE EVEN IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
YOU GET THE TRACTION CONTROL GOING I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
EVEN IF YOU TURN THE TRACTION CONTROL OFF OF COURSE 
IT ISN'T REALLY OFF 
YOU'VE GOT THE BRAKES STABBING AWAY AT THE BACK TYRES 
DESPERATELY TRYING TO CONTROL THE MOUNTAIN OF TORQUE 
JUST WASTING THEIR TIME YOU MAY AS WELL BLOW ON AN OIL RIG FIRE 
YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP A NEW TECHNIQUE WHICH IS BLAST DOWN THE STRAIGHT 
HARD ON THE BRAKES I'VE JUST MADE A CREASE IN THE RUNWAY 
AND THEN GO VERY SLOWLY SLOWLY 
EASE THE POWER IN STILL THE TRACTION CONTROL SQUIRMING AWAY 
OF NO THAT WAS TOO MUCH 
IT'S VERY HARD WORK THIS 
AND WORSE AFTER A WORRYINGLY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME 
THE BRAKES WERE COMPLETELY SHOT 
STILL AT LEAST THIS MEANT I COULD PULL OVER AND STOP THE MADNESS 
IN TERMS OF HANDLING THEN THIS CAR IS A NIGHTMARE 
IT JUST CANNOT COPE WITH THE VOLCANO UNDER THE BONNET 
HERE THEN IS TWO AND A BIT TONNES OF PROOF 
THAT ABSOLUTE POWER REALLY DOES CORRUPT ABSOLUTELY 
SO IT'S RUBBISH 
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT BY PUTTING IT ON OUR TRACK 
THAT MEANS HANDING IT OVER TO OUR TAME RACING DRIVER 
SOME SAY IF YOU LICK HIS CHEST IT TASTES EXACTLY THE SAME AS PICCALILLI 
AND THAT AT THIS WEEK'S BRIT AWARDS HE WAS ARRESTED FOR GOOSING RUSSELL BRAND 
ALL WE KNOW IS HE'S CALLED THE STIG 
THE TYRES STRUGGLING TO CONTAIN ALL THE TORQUES 
HE'S PILING INTO THE FIRST CORNER ALREADY 
A MIGHTY STRUGGLE BETWEEN POWER TRACTION CONTROL 
LOOK AT THAT UNBELIEVABLE DRIVING 
HE COULD HEAR THE OTHER'S HEART BEATING 
STIG'S TALKING BOOK COLLECTION GETTING ANOTHER AIRING THERE 
AS HE BARRELS THROUGH CHICAGO NOT LOOKING ALL THAT FAST 
LUNATIC OF A CAR THIS THING THROUGH THE HAMMERHEAD 
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT WOBBLING AROUND AS THE COMPUTERS 
STRUGGLING TO KEEP IT ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW 
I LOVE HIM SHE SHOUTED TO THE ELEMENTS I LOVE HIM 
HE CAN REALLY WIND IT UP HERE MAKE UP SOME LOST TIME 
BUT HE'S GOT TO HAVE LIFTED EVEN THE STIG'S NOT THAT STUPID 
IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK THAT FAST 
YOU CAN'T GET THE POWER ON WHEN YOU WANT TO 
SECOND TO LAST CORNER JUST HOLDING IT ON THE TRACK 
THROUGH GAMBON AND ACROSS THE LINE 
YOU'RE APPLAUDING BUT 
READY 
AN ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX POINT TWO 
THE PROBLEM IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD 
MERCEDES SPEND ONE MILLION A DAY ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
A MILLION A DAY SO THEY'VE GOT THE BEST BRAINS IN THE WORLD WITH ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD 
TO MAKE THE STANDARD CAR AS GOOD AS IT CAN BE 
HOWEVER I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS THE END FOR TUNING COMPANIES 
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE JAG HERE THEY SPENT THIRTY FIVE P. DESIGNING THIS 
MAKE NO MISTAKE I LOVE IT 
BUT I DO THINK THERE'S MORE POWER TO BE GOT OUT OF A V. EIGHT UNDER THIS BONNET 
THIS IS A PRIME CANDIDATE FOR SOMEONE TO COME ALONG AND TUNE IT UP A BIT 
YOU'RE RIGHT AND WHAT'S MORE WE'RE BRITISH THE INVENTORS OF EVERYTHING 
IT IS TIME TO BRACE OURSELVES HASTEN UNTO THE SHED 
AND LIBERATE OURSELVES FROM THE ABYSS MADE DARK BY THE LIGHTS OF PERVERTED GERMAN SCIENCE 
I THINK HE REALLY HAS LOST IT THIS WEEK 
IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE WE CAN MOVE ON BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR THE COOL WALL 
WE'LL BEGIN BY MOVING ALL THE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE CARS DOWN 
ALL OF THEM ALL OF THEM ARE GOING DOWN 
TIMES HAVE MOVED ON RICHARD TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
YES BUT NOT ALL FOUR BY FOURS ARE DRIVEN BY WOMEN AROUND CHELSEA 
I AGREE WITH YOU I AGREE WITH MOST PEOPLE HERE 
THAT FOUR BY FOURS ARE NOT KILLING POLAR BEARS BUT 
SOME OF US LIVE IN THE COUNTRY WE NEED THEM 
CARS ARE ALL ABOUT PULLING WOMEN FOR US OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN FOR BLOKES 
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA PULL SOCIALIST WOMEN WITH THESE 
WHAT DOES THAT MATTER YOU'RE NOT MAKING SENSE 
SOCIALIST WOMEN ARE BETTER IN BED THAN TORY WOMEN 
LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THIS WAY O. K. 
I'LL GIVE YOU A STRAIGHT CHOICE VANESSA REDGRAVE OR A. N. N. WIDDECOMBE 
CRIKEY VANESSA REDGRAVE THERE YOU ARE 
AND AS A RESULT THEY'VE ALL GOT TO COME DOWN THEY'RE NOT COOL ANY MORE 
THEY'RE JUST NOT 
KNOW WHAT I'LL DO TO CELEBRATE I'LL BUY A RANGE ROVER 
I'M GOING TO GET A V. EIGHT ONE PETROL 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE THIS IS THE NEW LAMBORGHINI GALLARDO SPYDER 
WHAT DO WE THINK 
HOW COOL'S THAT 
WHAT DO WE THINK SUB ZERO IN THE FRIDGE 
SUB ZERO IN THE FRIDGE 
HOLD ON EVERYONE WITH YOUR OPINIONS 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF CRUCIAL THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW 
NUMBER ONE HE'S JUST BOUGHT ONE LOOK AT THIS 
NUMBER TWO I'M HAVING THE WALL EXTENDED THROUGH THAT WALL DOWN THERE 
TO ADD A NEW REALLY REALLY REALLY SERIOUSLY UNCOOL SECTION 
THAT IS TRUE IF WE BUY ONE WE RUIN THE REPUTATION OF THAT CAR 
WHICH IS WHY WE PUT THAT OVER THERE BUT THIS THE FORD G. T. CAN AT LAST COME UP HERE 
COS I'VE GOT RID OF IT 
NEXT ONE PORSCHE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN G. T. THREE R. S. 
G. T. THREE R. S. 
A BRILLIANT BRILLIANT CAR 
BUT EVEN I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE THAT THAT'S COOL 
KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS THIS IS THE TEST WE HAVE AS YOU KNOW 
WHY HAVE YOU GOT SCAFFOLDING IN THE BACK 
IT'S A ROLL CAGE IN CASE I FALL OVER 
SHE'S JUST GOING TO GET OUT 
WHY HAS IT GOT A FIRE EXTINGUISHER IN CASE WE BURST INTO FLAMES ON A RACETRACK 
OPENING THE GLOVE BOX AND GOING WHY IS THERE DETTOL IN HERE 
IN CASE MY EYE INFECTION FLARES UP AGAIN 
IT'S GOING RIGHT DOWN HERE 
YOU KNOW IF YOU PUT A COCKOMETER AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A WHAT 
A COCKOMETER YOU KNOW YOU DRIVE INTO VILLAGES AND IT TELLS YOU YOUR SPEED 
IF THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE ALONGSIDE TELLING YOU HOW MUCH OF A COCK YOU LOOK 
IT'D BE RIGHT OFF THE SCALE IF YOU DROVE PAST IN ONE OF THOSE 
THAT IS A KIA CEE'D OH FOR GOD'S SAKE 
NOW HANG ON I'M LOSING THE WILL TO LIVE 
DOES ANYBODY HERE THINK THAT'S COOL 
ABSOLUTE RUBBISH HAVE YOU DRIVEN ONE 
I WOULDN'T WANT ONE 
NO DID SOMEONE SAY YES 
YOU'VE DRIVEN A KIA CEE'D 
I WORK FOR KIA 
ON PURPOSE OR IS IT JUST BAD UNEMPLOYMENT IN YOUR TOWN 
IT'S A FABULOUS CAR AND IT'S A FABULOUS COMPANY 
REALLY 
YOU'RE NOT HELPING ME THERE NO EXCEPT FOR ONE TINY DETAIL 
THE KOREANS EAT DOGS 
YOU'RE GONNA COME DOWN ONE MORNING AND DON'T COME CRYING TO ME WHEN YOU FIND TOP GEAR DOG IN A BAP 
THIS IS YOUR LOGIC AND IT'S FRIGHTENING 
I'M ON THE MONEY COME ON BE HONEST 
WHY IF YOU WORK FOR KIA HAVE YOU GOT A TVR T. SHIRT ON 
BECAUSE TVRS ARE BRITISH AND THEY'RE FAST AND THEY'RE SUB ZERO 
EVERYTHING KIAS AREN'T 
RIGHT 
THIS DUCATI ONE THOUSAND NINETY EIGHT 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
IT'S A DUCATI ONE THOUSAND NINETY EIGHT I'D LIKE TO PUT IT FORWARD TO GO ON THE BOARD 
SERIOUSLY THERE'S EVERY REASON WHY THIS IS A VERY VERY COOL BIKE 
NOW EARLIER ON RICHARD HAMMOND AND I WERE ATTEMPTING TO PROVE JOHN F. CLARKSON WRONG 
BY TURNING A RELIANT ROBIN INTO A SPACE SHUTTLE 
WHEN WE LEFT THE ACTION IT WAS ALL GOING TERRIBLY WELL 
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE THEME 
THE LAUNCH SITE WAS A MILITARY BASE WHOSE WHEREABOUTS ARE TOP SECRET 
THE BUILD BEGAN AND SOON THE MAIN FUEL TANK WAS ASSEMBLED AND ATTACHED TO THE LAUNCH PAD 
TOGETHER WITH THE SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS 
THESE PARTS CONTAINED THE EIGHTY FIVE TONS OF ROCKET POWER 
THAT WOULD TAKE THE RELIANT UP INTO THE HEAVENS 
HERE'S WHAT TERRIFIES ME 
AS IT IS HERE ON THAT LET'S BE HONEST BIT OF SCAFFOLDING 
YEAH 
LOOK IT'S FINE 
IT'S HELD DOWN WITH SOME OLD CONCRETE BLOCKS 
AND STRAPS YOU'D USE TO HOLD FURNITURE DOWN IN A REMOVAL VAN IT'S PERFECT 
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING USEFUL WE CAN DO SOMEWHERE 
AS IT HAPPENED THERE WAS 
WE WERE SENT OFF TO DIG A BUNKER FOR STEVE 
THE MODEL AEROPLANE PILOT WHO WOULD GUIDE THE RELIANT IN 
BUT THAT WASN'T EASY 
BECAUSE THE LAUNCH SITE IS LITTERED WITH UNEXPLODED BOMBS 
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING A PRECISION METAL DETECTOR 
WITH YOUR METAL DETECTOR YOU CAN HUNT FOR COINS RELICS 
GOLD AND SILVER JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE DOES IT SAY BOMBS NO 
JAMES HAD BOUGHT HIS METAL DETECTOR AT ARGOS 
SO I GOT MYSELF SOME SERIOUS BODY ARMOUR 
YOU'VE FOUND MY J. C. B. 
I JUST WORKED OUT SOMETHING FROM THIS 
IT ONLY WORKS DOWN TO A DEPTH OF ABOUT THREE INCHES 
AS IT TURNED OUT IT ALL WENT RATHER WELL 
IN THE MAIN 
LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE 
YOU PHILISTINE 
FINALLY OUR BUNKER WAS FINISHED 
SO THAT'S IT THEN GOOD 
WITH STEVE NOW FULLY PROTECTED 
WE WENT BACK TO THE LAUNCH SITE WHERE THERE WAS GOOD NEWS 
BANG ON TIME FOR ITS DATE WITH DESTINY 
THE RELIANT ROBIN HAD ARRIVED 
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT 
KEEP IT COMING 
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT ON THAT LINE 
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT YEP 
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT 
BACK NICE 
AND STOP 
THAT IS THE BUSINESS END OF A REUSABLE RELIANT ORBITER 
WOW 
THEN WE WERE ENTRUSTED WITH ANOTHER JOB 
YOU SPANNER THAT'S WHERE IT GOES ON THE WING 
WHAT'S IT GONNA LOOK LIKE WHEN IT'S POINTING UPWARDS BRILLIANT 
UPSIDE DOWN 
AS NIGHT FELL THE MOST DELICATE AND RISKY PART OF THE OPERATION BEGAN 
ATTACHING THE RELIANT SPACE ORBITER TO THE ROCKETS AND FUEL TANK 
WE'RE NOT KIDDING THIS BIT IS GENUINELY VERY SCARY 
BECAUSE AS THEY'RE MOUNTING IT UP WITH ALL THE COMPLICATED LINKAGES 
IF THE SHUTTLE CLONKS IT AND BENDS ANY OF THE RELEASE MECHANISMS 
IT WON'T COME OFF AND THEN THE SHUTTLE AND THE TANK WILL COME DOWN 
SHALL WE GO OVER AND HELP 
I THINK NOT 
DID YOU HEAR THAT REALLY UN MACHO THING HE SAID JUST NOW WHAT 
RIGHT COME ON LADS LET'S GET THIS ROBIN 
OH A LADDER'S COMING OUT 
NASA DON'T KEEP A STEPLADDER ON THE LAUNCH PAD 
ONE SMALL STEPLADDER 
WILL YOU STOP LAUGHING THEY'LL GET REALLY CROSS 
FINALLY THE ROBIN WAS ATTACHED 
AND THE COMPLETED SPACE SHUTTLE MADE FOR A TRULY AWESOME SIGHT 
EVERYTHING WAS LOOKING GOOD 
BUT LATER IN OUR SUITE AT THE LOCAL RITZ SHERATON 
I WAS A WORRIED MAN 
HAMMOND WHAT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CHANCES ARE OF IT ACTUALLY WORKING 
IT'LL WORK 
YOU KNOW WHEN WE DO THESE BIG THINGS THEY USUALLY END IN A MASSIVE DISASTER 
I'D QUITE LIKE THIS ONE TO WORK 
WELL IT'S UP IT'S BUILT 
BUT IT'S WORTH A QUICK REMINDER OF EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN 
WE'VE GOT EIGHTY FIVE TONS OF ROCKET THRUST TO PUSH THAT THING OFF THE GROUND 
AND AT ABOUT ONE ZERO ZERO ZERO F. T. THE TWO SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS WILL BE EMPTY 
THEY WILL FALL AWAY AND COME DOWN ON PARACHUTES DOING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. 
IT'LL CONTINUE ACCELERATING TO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
AND THEN AT ABOUT THREE ZERO ZERO ZERO F. T. THE ORBITER ITSELF WILL DETACH FROM THE MAIN BODY 
THAT'S WHEN STEVE THE PILOT TAKES CONTROL 
IT'S HIS JOB TO GLIDE IT IN 
HE HAS THE OPTION OF FIRING THREE ROCKETS TO EXTEND THAT GLIDE 
HE'LL PUT IT DOWN ON THE DECK ON THE LANDING STRIP AND PROVE IT'S A REUSABLE CRAFT 
YEAH OF COURSE ALL THAT WE'VE SAID IS JUST WORDS WORDS 
LET'S BE HONEST WHO KNOWS 
THE LAST FEW HOURS WERE TAKEN UP WITH FINAL PREPARATIONS 
AND WITH SUCH AN AMBITIOUS PROJECT AS THIS 
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ONBOARD SYSTEMS WAS SIMPLY STAGGERING 
EACH ELECTRONIC COMPONENT HAD TO TALK TO EVERY OTHER ELECTRONIC COMPONENT 
AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME 
THERE HAVE BEEN ONE OR TWO DELAYS 
MOST OF THESE ARE OF AN ELECTRICAL NATURE 
THERE'S A LONG WIRE LEADING FROM LAUNCH CONTROL DOWN TO THE ROCKET 
AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT HAD A BREAK 
JAMES A COW RAN THROUGH IT 
THAT'S ALL SORTED WE ARE NOW FUELLING THE BIRD 
AND ONCE THAT'S DONE THERE CAN BE NO DELAYS 
IT'S FULL OF FUEL SO THEY HAVE TO LIGHT THAT CANDLE YEAH 
THE TENSION NOW WAS ALMOST UNBEARABLE 
YOU COULD ALMOST HEAR JEREMY PREPARING SOME INTERGALACTIC SMUGNESS 
SO WOULD IT STAY ON COURSE DURING THE ASCENT 
WOULD THE ROCKETS AND FUEL TANK DETACH 
AND WOULD STEVE WHO HAD REFUSED OUR KIND OFFER OF A BUNKER 
BE ABLE TO PILOT THE ROBIN DOWN SAFELY 
IN JUST A FEW SECONDS WE'D KNOW 
OH YEAH 
GO ON 
YES 
IT'S NOT COMING OFF 
SEPARATE SEPARATE 
SEPARATE TWELVE ONE THOUSAND 
OH NO 
THAT'S WHY HOW WERE YOU GONNA USE IT AGAIN 
THAT'S ENOUGH REALLY 
NEXT WEEK THESE TWO COMPLETELY LOSE TOUCH WITH REALITY 
AND TRY TO GET THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH WITH A LAWNMOWER 
I THINK WE DID QUITE WELL 
BY WHAT MEASURE DO YOU ARRIVE AT THAT CONCLUSION 
IN FAIRNESS IT WAS ONLY ONE BOLT THAT LET US DOWN 
IT WAS ONLY ONE ICEBERG THAT SANK THE TITANIC 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS YOU JUST BLEW A BIG HOLE IN NORTHUMBERLAND 
YEAH AND NEXT WEEK ALL OF US ARE RUINING BEDFORDSHIRE WITH TRACTORS 
THAT'S TRUE BUT I'M ALSO DRIVING UP AND DOWN OUR TRACK VERY FAST IN A LAMBORGHINI 
WE REALLY HOPE WE'LL SEE YOU THERE TAKE CARE GOOD NIGHT
