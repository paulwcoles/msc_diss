AND YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO DESCRIBE THINGS VERY CORRECTLY IN WRITING 
RECOGNISE THIS NICE PIECE OF ART DECO 
IT'S BRITAIN'S FIRST PURPOSE BUILT BROADCAST CENTRE 
AND THE PERFECT PLACE FOR ME TO RECORD 
WHAT I'M AFRAID IS MY VERY LAST PROGRAMME FOR THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW 
DEAR OLD BROADCASTING HOUSE 
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS IT STILL FILLS ME WITH AWE 
MY FAVOURITE UNCLE USED TO LIVE HERE UNCLE MAC 
HE DID CHILDREN'S HOUR ON THE WIRELESS 
I NEVER DREAMED THAT ONE DAY I'D DO MY OWN RADIO SHOWS FROM HERE 
OUR STUDIOS WERE DOWN IN THE BASEMENT 
VERY HANDY FOR THE BAKERLOO LINE 
AND THERE'S THE MIGHTY LORD REITH 
WHO CREATED THE B. B. C. WITH HIS BARE HANDS 
THIS IS WHERE THE FEELING OF AWE GIVES WAY TO TERROR 
THIS IS THE OFFICE OF THE D. G. 
THE DIRECTOR GENERAL 
IT WAS THE CENTRE OF POWER A PLACE OF TWEED AND PIPE TOBACCO 
AND THE OCCASIONAL WHIFF OF GUNPOWDER 
AH 
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT 
VERY COSY 
AND OUR OWN LITTLE HALL OF FAME 
LORD REITH'S CURRENT REPRESENTATIVE ON EARTH HAS KINDLY AGREED 
SINCE TONIGHT IS MY LAST ROADSHOW 
THAT WE CAN USE THIS ROOM AS OUR HEADQUARTERS 
IT'S A CHANCE FOR ME TO CELEBRATE MY TIME ON THE PROGRAMME 
IN THE COMPANY OF A FEW GOOD FRIENDS 
IN MY EIGHT YEARS ON THE ROAD I'VE INTRODUCED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SHOWS 
FROM A FABULOUS SELECTION OF LOCATIONS 
I WISH I COULD REMEMBER THEM ALL 
THE SHEER SCALE AND BEAUTY OF POWIS CASTLE IN MID WALES 
IS QUITE OPERATIC 
DUNROBIN CASTLE HAS BEEN THE HOME OF THE EARLS AND DUKES OF SUTHERLAND 
SINCE THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY 
AND TODAY AT RENISHAW HALL THE STAGE IS SET FOR ANOTHER ROADSHOW 
THIS IS PORTMEIRION IN NORTH WALES 
THE PALACE HAMPTON COURT 
WELL THIS WEEK WE'VE COME TO CELEBRATE A PIECE OF WORK 
THAT MAY LOOK MODEST NOW 
BUT IN ITS DAY WAS AN ACHIEVEMENT ON A MONUMENTAL SCALE 
HADRIAN'S WALL 
THE NAME OTTAWA COMES FROM AN ALGONQUIN INDIAN TRIBE 
WHO HUNTED AND TRADED FURS IN THIS AREA 
LONG BEFORE ANY EUROPEANS ARRIVED 
WELCOME TO A VERY SPECIAL EDITION OF THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW DOWN UNDER 
THE CURRENT LORD MAYOR OF THE SQUARE MILE 
LIVES HERE AT THE MANSION HOUSE 
ROLL UP ROLL UP TWENTY WORLD CLASS ANTIQUES SPECIALISTS 
FREE VALUATION EVERY TIME 
COME AND GET IT 
MY VERY FIRST OUTING WAS TO BARNSTAPLE IN NORTH DEVON 
IT WAS ON EIGHTH MARCH IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND I WAS VERY VERY NERVOUS 
IT WAS LIKE BEING HANDED A PIECE OF PRECIOUS GLASS 
AND BEING SCARED THAT YOU WERE GOING TO DROP IT 
BUT STRAIGHT AWAY EXCITING EVENTS TOOK OVER 
SIMON BULL OUR WATCHES AND CLOCKS SPECIALIST 
HAD SOME ASTONISHING NEWS FOR ONE CURIOUS OWNER 
I BOUGHT IT OFF A CHAP THAT WAS DEALING IN BRIC A BRAC 
IN NEWPORT MARKET IN SOUTH WALES SOME TWENTY TO TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO 
AND THERE WAS TROUBLE WITH THE WATCH IT WASN'T KEEPING TIME 
SO HE SAID IF YOU LET ME HAVE IT BACK 
I KNOW A MAN THAT CAN GET IT FIXED BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY WHAT DID YOU PAY HIM ER 
SEVENTY OR EIGHTY AND I THINK I GAVE HIM ABOUT A TENNER TO GET IT FIXED 
WHICH WAS A LOT OF MONEY THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY YEAH TWENTY YEARS AGO 
YEAH AND THEY WERE WORN OUTSIDE 
PROBABLY ON A BIG LEATHER OR FLEECE FLYING JACKET YES 
ACTUALLY OUTSIDE SO YOU COULD READ IT WHEN YOU WERE IN THE COCKPIT 
YEAH AND IT'S A FIRST WORLD WAR PILOT'S WATCH YES 
AND HENCE THE THE VERY CLEAR WHITE DIAL WITH THE BLACK NUMBERS 
WELL AS A WATCH 
IT'S PROBABLY WORTH IN FACT MORE LIKE TWO THOUSAND OR SO YEAH 
BUT THIS IS A REPAIR BILL 
YEAH YEAH NINETEEN THIRTY THREE YEAH 
MADE OUT TO A T. E. SHAW OF CLOUDS HILL MORETON IN DORSET 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT YEAH DO YOU KNOW WHO HE IS NO I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE 
IT'S LAWRENCE OF ARABIA GOOD GOD 
I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS A CHARACTER OF FICTION I DID 
NO NO IT'S THE T. E. LAWRENCE OF THE FILM AND WHO WROTE THE BOOK YEAH 
I REMEMBER SEEING THE FILM YEARS AGO BUT I RECKON AND HE LIVED I'M SURE 
FROM MY RECOLLECTIONS HE LIVED AT CLOUDS HILL IN DORSET 
I THINK HE WAS KILLED UNDER THE NAME OF SHAW ON HIS MOTORCYCLE WHEN DRESSED IN R. A. F. KIT GOOD GOD 
IT'S ACTUALLY HIS WATCH PROBABLY RETURNED TO HIM IN NINETEEN THIRTY 
HAVING BEEN CLEANED UNDER THE NAME THE PSEUDONYM THAT HE'D ADOPTED 
GOOD GOD 
SO YEAH 
COUPLE OF GRAND COUPLE AND A HALF JUST AS A WATCH YES 
HOW MUCH YOU COULD ADD FOR THE LAWRENCE CONNECTION I DON'T KNOW 
HE'S ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING CHARACTERS OF THE EARLY PART OF THIS CENTURY YEAH I WOULD 
IT'S A GUESS I'D DOUBLE THAT MAYBE FIVE MAYBE TEN GOOD GOD 
I'D BETTER GET IT INSURED THEN 
FANCY THAT MY VERY FIRST ROADSHOW 
AND WE FIND A RELIC OF MY BOYHOOD HERO THE GREAT LAWRENCE OF ARABIA 
PEOPLE OFTEN ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ITEMS WE FIND ON THE SHOW 
WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE LAWRENCE WATCH ENDED UP AT THE OMEGA MUSEUM IN GENEVA 
ON THE WAY IT CHANGED HANDS FOR EIGHTY THOUSAND SWISS FRANCS 
THAT'S ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND 
THE BEST BIT OF THE SHOW FOR ME 
IS WHEN AN EXPERT BRINGS SOME INANIMATE OBJECT TO LIFE 
OR SOME BIT OF CRAFTSMANSHIP GETS THEIR EMOTIONS GOING 
HERE ARE TWO OF OUR TEAM AT FULL THROTTLE OVER SOME SUPERB ITEMS 
THAT IS JUST GLORIOUS ISN'T IT 
YES AND IT WAS VERY VERY POPULAR THIS TYPE OF EMBROIDERED PICTURE 
IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
NOW IT'S GOT A LOT OF DIFFERENT STITCHES ON IT 
I MEAN THERE'S LOVELY CHENILLE WORK HERE WITH THE MOSS 
IT HAS SATIN STITCH 
THERE'S COUCHED WORK IN WHICH ALL THE EXPENSIVE THREAD WAS ON THE TOP 
NONE OF IT WAS BEHIND WHERE IT WOULDN'T BE SEEN 
AND OF COURSE EVERYWHERE CATCHING THE LIGHT AS I TILT IT 
WE HAVE GOLD THREAD WE HAVE BITS OF MICA AND ALL IN ALL 
IF YOU HAD A TICK LIST OF ALL THE THINGS 
THAT YOU WANTED TO SEE IN A SEVENTEENTH CENTURY EMBROIDERY 
THIS HAS IT ACTUALLY WITH KNOBS ON 
WELL THIS IS MAGNIFICENT ENGLISH FURNITURE 
THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY 
AND IT'S OF A QUALITY ONE PUTS AUTOMATICALLY INTO THE EXHIBITION CATEGORY 
THERE MUST BE TWENTY DIFFERENT WOODS AND AS MANY DIFFERENT PATTERNS 
WE WERE MAKING BY THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTIES PERFECT FURNITURE 
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS IN CABINET MAKING IS CREATING A CORNER PROPERLY 
AND HERE AT THE TOP OF THIS COLUMN THIS CORINTHIAN STYLE COLUMN 
YOU'VE GOT THIS WONDERFUL CAP 
AND YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE TINY PIECE OF IVORY JUST ON THE CORNER 
AND IT FOLLOWS ROUND YES IT DOES 
ON A PIECE OF SUCH SIZE 
ONLY THE VERY BEST MAKER WOULD BOTHER WITH THAT LITTLE PIECE THERE 
HILARY AND JOHN HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE YOU 
TO LEARN ALL THAT TECHNICAL STUFF 
WELL I SUPPOSE I WAS HELPED BECAUSE I STARTED OUT LIFE AS AN AUCTIONEER 
AND YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO DESCRIBE THINGS VERY CORRECTLY IN WRITING 
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE RELYING ON 
IS THOSE DESCRIPTIONS SO I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN IT 
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT YOU LEARN FROM AN EARLY AGE 
I KNEW MORE AT SOTHEBY'S WHEN I WAS NINETEEN AND THE LEARNING CURVE IS VERY QUICK 
BUT I MEAN SINCE THEN WE'VE DONE NOTHING ELSE 
IT SOUNDS CLEVER AND TECHNICAL BUT IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE 
IT'S YOUR OWN LANGUAGE YES EXACTLY 
IT'S A BROAD CANVAS OF DESIGN AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL HISTORY 
FASHION MANUFACTURE 
I THINK OF SHAKESPEARE'S TYPEWRITER 
YOU WHAT 
I THINK OF SHAKESPEARE'S TYPEWRITER 
HOW DO WE KNOW HE DIDN'T HAVE ONE 
OH EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THEY COULDN'T MAKE IT 
WELL ALL I DO IS TO REFINE THAT PROCESS OF THOUGHT 
WONDERFUL WONDERFUL LEGS 
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN FOUR LEGS LIKE THAT ON A CARD TABLE BEFORE 
OUTSIDE OF A MUSEUM 
THERE'S EVERYTHING THERE THAT THERE SHOULD BE ON AN ENGLISH CARD TABLE 
THE SCROLL IS A DOUBLE SCROLL IT'S GOT THIS CURVILINEAR LITTLE PAPER SCROLL AT THE TOP HERE 
AND THEN THAT WONDERFUL SHELL 
AND THEN RIGHT DOWN HERE THE LITTLE DROPS ON THIS PENDULUM HERE 
AND THEN A CLAW AND BALL FOOT TO DIE FOR 
IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL I MEAN THAT'S A CLAW AND BALL FOOT 
THERE IS THE SACRED PEARL OF WISDOM BEING HELD BY THE DRAGON'S CLAW 
AS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE 
WONDERFUL WONDERFUL ALL THE SHAPE IN THE WORLD 
I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T EVEN SAID HELLO 
ONE OF THE BEST BITS OF FURNITURE I'VE SEEN FOR A LONG TIME 
OF THIS TYPE THIS PERIOD ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE TO ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY 
GEORGE THE SECOND MAYBE EARLY GEORGE THE THIRD 
THAT TABLE FOR EXAMPLE 
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE PERIOD WHEN THEY DESIGNED IT 
OR AFTER THE PERIOD WHEN THEY MADE IT BY MACHINE 
SO SHAKESPEARE'S TYPEWRITER 
DO YOU FIND THAT ON MOST ROADSHOWS THERE IS AT LEAST ONE THING THAT MAKES YOUR HEART LEAP 
MICHAEL THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT MAKES MY HEART LEAP 
WHETHER IT WILL MAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S HEARTS LEAP IS A DIFFERENT MATTER 
BECAUSE THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS OUT THERE THAT LIGHT MY FIRE 
WHETHER IT'S AS WE'VE SEEN EARLY EMBROIDERY 
OR A PIECE OF ROCK AND ROLL MEMORABILIA 
OR SOMETHING OFF A GREAT CAR OR WHATEVER IT IS 
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME ASPECT THAT WILL REALLY MAKE MY EYES SPARKLE 
WE HAVE GOT ANOTHER WHALING SHIP FLYING THE BRITISH FLAG 
THE WHITE ENSIGN 
AND ALONGSIDE HERE YOU CAN SEE A WHALE 
IS ACTUALLY STRAPPED TO THE SIDE OF THE VESSEL 
AND ON THE BACK THERE IS A REPRESENTATION 
OF A WHALE HUNT IN OPERATION 
AND PERHAPS THE MOST EXCITING THING FOR ME 
IS LOOKING AT THE STYLE I'M ALMOST CERTAIN 
THAT IT'S THE WORK OF SOMEBODY CALLED EDWARD BURDETT 
THE FIRST SCRIMSHAW ARTIST WHO IS DOCUMENTED 
HIS STYLE IS VERY DISTINCTIVE AND ALTHOUGH THESE AREN'T SIGNED 
THEY'RE RECOGNISABLE THEY'RE INSTANTLY RECOGNISABLE AS HIS WORK 
THEY REALLY ARE STAGGERINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND VERY IMPORTANT 
IN THE HISTORY OF SCRIMSHAW WORK 
I HAVE TO SAY I WALK AWAY FROM EVERY ROADSHOW FEELING 
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THERE THAT'S MADE MY HEART SKIP A BEAT JOHN 
I THINK IT'S THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY 
BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST THE MOST WONDERFUL WONDERFUL CHARACTERS 
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY THERE I COME AWAY REMEMBERING 
AND THERE'S NOBODY ELSE THAT WILL QUEUE UP FOR FOUR OR FIVE HOURS 
TO BE TOLD WHAT THEY'VE GOT ISN'T VERY GOOD AND SAY THANK YOU I'VE HAD A WONDERFUL DAY 
IT ONLY HAPPENS IN ENGLAND AND IT PUTS MY FAITH BACK IN HUMAN NATURE 
RIGHT LET'S NOW SEE HOW THOSE FOUR OWNERS REACTED 
AFTER YOU TOLD THEM VERY INTERESTING THINGS 
AND THEN THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF TINKLING BRASS 
AS FAR AS VALUE IS CONCERNED I WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT 
IT WOULD FETCH BETWEEN EIGHT THOUSAND AND TEN THOUSAND IN AUCTION 
AND IN TODAY'S MARKET A MODEST INSURANCE VALUATION WOULD BE FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
REALLY YES YES THAT'S THAT'S A MODEST VALUATION 
AND I WOULD HAVE SAID WE'RE TALKING BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
GOSH AS MUCH AS THAT 
YES DEFINITELY AS MUCH AS THAT 
IF WE CAN TRACE IT TO A MAKER 
THEN THIS PIECE OF FURNITURE WOULD BE IN EXCESS OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
GOD 
BUT DON'T WORRY WE HAVEN'T FOUND HIM YET 
GOOD 
IF WE CAN'T IF WE CAN'T 
THEN I'M AFRAID IT WOULD ONLY BE WORTH ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND 
EITHER WAY IT'S FANTASTIC I HAD NO IDEA 
WELL THOSE THOSE WERE GREAT MOMENTS 
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT PIECE AFTERWARDS WAS IT SOLD 
THE CREDENZA THE REWARDING THING FOR ME IS THAT NO SHE DIDN'T SELL 
AND KEPT IT AND SHE WROTE TO THE PROGRAMME 
TO SAY THAT SHE'D DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESEARCH AND SHE HAS FOUND OUT WHO IT WAS MADE FOR 
AN EXTREMELY WEALTHY FAMILY A VERY FAMOUS FAMILY 
AND WHERE THE HOUSE WAS WHICH IS NOW PULLED DOWN WHEN IT WAS PULLED DOWN 
WHEN HER GREAT AUNT'S MOTHER BOUGHT IT AND WHO MADE IT 
SO I MEAN IT IT WAS WONDERFUL 
I SORT OF I FEEL THAT I INSPIRED HER TO NOT SELL BUT TO FIND OUT 
AND NOW OF COURSE IT'S A FAMILY HEIRLOOM AND IT WILL STAY IN THE FAMILY 
SO THAT WAS VERY GOOD FANTASTIC 
AND AS FAR AS THE SCRIMSHAW IS CONCERNED 
I READ THROUGH THE TRADE PRESS THAT THAT IN FACT WAS SOLD 
OR THE TWO PIECES WERE SOLD OUT IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS 
SO A NICE ENDING FOR HER 
THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE HAPPY ENDINGS 
I WISH I COULD SAY THAT I'D LEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM YOU BOTH 
BUT ALL I CAN SAY IS THANKS FOR YOUR COMPANY VERY MUCH INDEED 
WELL MICHAEL I HAVE TO SAY IT'S IT'S BEEN A HUGE PRIVILEGE 
TO BE INVITED TO THIS YOUR RETROSPECTIVE PROGRAMME 
IT'S BEEN A FABULOUS TIME WITH YOU ON THE ROADSHOW 
AND WE'RE GOING TO MISS YOU TERRIBLY 
AND WE HOPE THAT EVERYTHING IN THE FUTURE GOES HAPPILY FOR YOU 
THANK YOU SAME TO YOU 
THE THING ABOUT MICHAEL I WENT TO HIS WELCOMING PARTY EIGHT YEARS AGO 
WHEN HE FIRST STARTED AND HE SAID 
I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY I'VE BEEN CHOSEN IT'S BECAUSE I'M BLAND 
I'M THE BLANDEST THING ON TELEVISION 
WELL IT'S EIGHT YEARS ON AND THIS IS HIS LEAVING PARTY 
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT MAN IS NOT BLAND HE'S AN ABSOLUTE SUPERSTAR 
BUT HE'S A MOST INTERESTING INTELLIGENT PERSON AND HE'S BEEN 
A VERY ENJOYABLE COMPANION FOR ALL OF THAT TIME WE'LL MISS HIM GREATLY 
THE DEIRDRES WILL NOW SOOTHE THE FEVERED BROW 
WITH THEIR RENDITION OF A HAUNTING MELODY 
BLACKPOOL END OF PIER NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN 
FRAID NOT NO 
IT STRETCHES YOUR FINGERS 
STRETCHES THE WIDTH BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS IT'S AN INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE 
WOULD YOU TURN IT AWAY FROM ME PLEASE 
WELL HOW MANY OF THESE THINGS HAVE YOU GOT 
I HAVE ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED 
ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED YES I'VE NOT GOT THE BIGGEST COLLECTION 
BUT CERTAINLY SOME OF THE RAREST PIECES 
YES GOOD BOY 
WELL FORGIVE ME I WOULD SAY THAT WAS GROTESQUE 
TO THE POINT OF NIGHTMARISHNESS 
BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING YOU TREASURE 
WELL TREASURE PERHAPS WE'VE CERTAINLY LOOKED AFTER IT 
AH THAT'S MORE LIKE IT I'VE COME TO LIFE 
LET'S HEAR YOURS AGAIN THAT'S SOME BARK 
THE ONLY PEOPLE I KNOW WHO USE WHITE GLOVES TO TOUCH OBJECTS 
ARE THE NATIONAL TRUST ARE YOU FROM THE NATIONAL TRUST 
STRANGELY ENOUGH NO I'M NOT 
I'M DRESSED AS THE GHOST OF A HIGHWAY ROBBER ADAM LYLE DECEASED 
WELL IT IS ONE HUNDRED SIX YEARS OLD AFTER ALL 
IF I SMELL AS GOOD AS THAT AFTER ONE HUNDRED SIX YEARS I SHALL BE VERY SURPRISED 
THAT'S BRILLIANT WOW 
IN A FEW YEARS YOU CAN HAVE ME STUFFED AND PUT IN THE WINDOW AS WELL THANKS EVER SO MUCH 
ONE QUICK TUG AND ALL IS REVEALED 
THE GENIE WILL TELL US EVERYTHING HOPEFULLY 
I WONDER HOW MANY RABBITS THAT'S SEEN OFF I WONDER 
ONE QUESTION WHAT WAS IT 
WHEN I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE TAKEN TO AUSTRALIA AS THE TEAM MASCOT 
A FEW YEARS AGO WE WERE ALL OVERWHELMED BY THE WARMTH OF OUR RECEPTION 
BEING A SPORTING NATION AND VERY KEEN TO SEE FAIR PLAY 
THE AUSSIES ALWAYS LOVE IT WHEN A FAKE TURNS UP ON THE SHOW WELL DON'T WE ALL 
ONE OF OUR EXPERTS SEEMS TO HAVE A PARTICULARLY GOOD NOSE 
FOR SPOTTING THINGS THAT ARE NOT QUITE RIGHT 
I'M AFRAID IT'S VERY BAD NEWS 
IT'S A FORGERY IS IT 
NOT ONLY IS IT A FORGERY IT IS ILLEGAL 
OH MINTON NEVER ACTUALLY MADE THIS PARTICULAR DISH 
YOU DON'T GET THIS CRAB ON HERE THESE COLOURS DON'T EXIST 
THEY DIDN'T DO THIS SHREDDED CLAY EFFECT 
SO WHERE YOU BOUGHT IT WAS BREAKING THE LAW SELLING THIS 
AND WHAT WE'VE GOT INSIDE 
ABSOLUTELY WHITE PRISTINE PIECE OF EARTHENWARE 
WITH NO DOULTON MAKER'S MARK ON IT RUBBISH 
THIS HAS GOT AN AMAZINGLY ANCIENT LOOK ABOUT IT 
YES PROBABLY BECAUSE IT'S OLDER THAN THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS I IMAGINE 
OLDER THAN THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS PERHAPS 
WELL THEY WERE AROUND ER NOUGHT WEREN'T THEY 
THIS WOULD BE AROUND THE HAN DYNASTY 
LIKE THE TERRACOTTA FIGURES 
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT 
I FOUND IT IN A FLEA MARKET IN SOUTH EAST LONDON A FEW YEARS AGO 
NOW HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR IT 
WELL HE WANTED LIKE FIFTY AND I HAD NO MONEY 
AND I BARTERED HIM DOWN TO THIRTY QUID 
HOW OLD IS IT COUPLE OF YEARS 
OH NO YOU'RE JOKING ARE YOU JOKING ARE YOU JOKING 
I'M NOT OH NO I'M SO SAD 
I'M SORRY I'M SORRY 
THE GREAT HEART BREAKER DAVID BATTIE 
YOU DO FIND THEM DON'T YOU 
FAKES I MEAN WELL THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS WE ALL DO 
BUT FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE PREPARED TO STAND UP IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA 
AND ACTUALLY SAY SO TO THE POOR OWNER 
I MEAN I'VE GOT A REPUTATION OF BEING MR. NASTY I THINK 
SO YOU CAN'T LET THE OWNER GO HOME WITHOUT KNOWING THEY HAVE A DUD 
BUT YOU TRY TO DO IT WITHOUT HURTING THEIR FEELINGS 
WE DO WE DO TRY OBVIOUSLY TO DO THAT 
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE 
USUALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE ADAMANT THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THE OBJECT IS 
IT MAY BE GENERATIONS OF FED MISINFORMATION DOWN THE LINE 
AND YOU SIMPLY SAY WHAT YOU SAY AND THEY'RE MORTIFIED 
IF THEY'D TOLD YOU ALL THIS FIRST 
THEN YOU COULD HAVE LET THEM DOWN A BIT MORE GENTLY BUT IT'S OFTEN NOT POSSIBLE 
ONE EXAMPLE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IS THAT CHINESE CHEST 
THAT WAS FOUND AT CHICHESTER 
THE OWNER PAID TWO THOUSAND FOR IT AND FROM THE QUALITY OF THE CARVING 
HE WAS CONVINCED HE'D BOUGHT SOMETHING OLD 
I BOUGHT IT ABOUT FIVE MONTHS AGO 
DOES ANYTHING STRIKE YOU 
NOT IN PARTICULAR 
NOT THAT IT'S SORT OF KIND OF CLEAN 
VERY CLEAN YES 
O. K. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS 
WOOD DUST WOOD DUST 
YES ABSOLUTELY DEAD RIGHT 
IT'S THE ORIGINAL DUST WHEN THIS WAS MADE REALLY 
AND THIS WAS NOT MADE VERY LONG AGO 
OH THESE CHESTS HAVE BEEN COMING OUT FROM 
SOUTH CHINA AND THE WHOLE OF THAT AREA SINCE THE LAST WAR RIGHT 
AND THIS ACTUALLY DATES FROM THE NINETEEN SIXTIES OH 
UM OFTEN MORE THAN ONE PERSON WORKED ON IT YES 
AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY WORKING AT THIS END SOMEBODY CHIPPING AWAY OVER HERE OH 
SO I'M AFRAID ALTHOUGH YOURS IS A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE 
IT'S NOT WORTH VERY MUCH OH 
AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT WORTH ANYTHING LIKE WHAT YOU PAID FOR IT 
REALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT 
IN A SALE 
TOP THREE HUNDRED 
OH RIGHT 
I'M SORRY RATHER DISAPPOINTING 
OH NO NO IF THAT'S THE TRUTH THEN OBVIOUSLY ONE MUST ACCEPT THE TRUTH 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LETTING US SEE IT NOT AT ALL THANK YOU 
AMAZING 
NINETEEN SIXTY 
WELL THE BRAVE OWNER OF THAT PROBLEMATIC CHEST IS WITH US NOW AS INDEED IS THE CHEST 
SO FRED CAMERON ER I WATCHED THAT RECORDING 
AND WE ALL FELT FOR YOU THE DISAPPOINTMENT ETC 
I WONDERED HOW IT WAS FOR YOU AFTERWARDS 
DID YOU GET A LOT OF MICKEY TAKING WELL I DID IN ACTUAL FACT 
ONE OR TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES SEEMED TO THINK 
THAT I WAS IN THE ANTIQUE TRADE AND I HAD A NUMBER OF OFFERS TO VISIT THEIR HOMES 
IN ORDER TO OFFER A PRICE FOR WHAT THEY THOUGHT TO BE ANTIQUES 
BUT THEY DID SAY THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A GOOD PRICE 
AND THOUGHT I HAD THE REPUTATION OF PAYING SLIGHTLY OVER THE ODDS 
SO TO BEGIN WITH YOU KNOW ONE COULD SMILE ABOUT THESE THINGS 
BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE THERE WAS A DEGREE OF IRRITATION 
BECAUSE WHEN I GOT THE VALUATION IT WAS A SHOCK 
BUT IT HASN'T DETERRED ME FROM WANTING TO OWN IT 
AND THE POINT ONE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT I SPOKE TO A GENTLEMAN TODAY 
WHO IS AN EXPERT CARVER OR SPECIALIST IN WORKING WITH WOOD 
AND HE HAD A GOOD LOOK AT THIS 
AND HE TOLD ME THAT IF HE WAS ASKED TO UNDERTAKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
WHICH ISN'T SOMETHING HE DOES EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK 
HE WOULD ESTIMATE THAT IT MIGHT TAKE THREE TO FOUR MONTHS 
IN TERMS OF WHAT WOULD IT COST 
WELL HE'D BE LOOKING AT SOMETHING IN THE REGION OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND PLUS 
YEAH BUT IT'S I HAVE TO TELL YOU FRED 
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LABOUR 
IT'S TO DO WITH THE MARKET 
IT'S TO DO WITH WHETHER I'M PREPARED TO TAKE OUT MY CREDIT CARD 
AND PASS MONEY ACROSS FOR THE OBJECT 
RIGHT I WOULDN'T AND NOR WOULD MOST OTHER PEOPLE 
BECAUSE IT'S OUT OF FASHION 
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES YOU KNOW 
IF YOU GO OUT ON A LIMB YOU CAN MAKE MISTAKES AND 
I CAN HARDLY LIFT THIS BUT THAT IS ONE I BOUGHT 
IT'S AN INDIAN CAST BRONZE AND GILT EWER FROM THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
WORTH ABOUT TEN THOUSAND 
AND I BOUGHT IT ON THE INTERNET 
AND IT COST ME AROUND FOUR HUNDRED 
AND IT'S A BRAND NEW MODERN FORGERY 
NOW THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT TO MAKE THAT TODAY IN EUROPE 
WOULD PROBABLY COST 
I DON'T KNOW FIVE THOUSAND TO MAKE THAT IT'S A FANTASTIC PIECE OF WORK 
SO WHAT YOU'RE REALLY SAYING IN EFFECT IS 
IF IT'S OLD ENOUGH AND IF IT'S RARE ENOUGH 
RARITY IS IF IT'S UGLY AS SIN 
IT COULD BE WORTH THOUSANDS OF POUNDS 
AND YET SOMETHING WHICH IN MY EYES IS A THING OF BEAUTY 
CAN BE VIRTUALLY WORTHLESS 
LOOK 
THIS HAS FOUND THE RIGHT OWNER 
YOU LOVE IT I DO AND THAT COULDN'T BE HAPPIER 
I CAN'T BEAR ANY MORE OF THIS 
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU FIFTEEN THOUSAND FOR THEM BOTH O. K. FINAL OFFER 
WHEN THE ROADSHOW CAME TO WILTON HOUSE NEAR SALISBURY 
THE WEATHER WAS ATROCIOUS AND THE RAIN CAME DOWN IN STAIR RODS 
AND MICHAEL WAS TOLD THERE WAS AN ELDERLY LADY IN THE CAR PARK 
WHO WAS DESPERATELY KEEN TO MEET HIM 
BUT DIDN'T THINK SHE'D MAKE IT THROUGH THE RAIN AND THE QUEUES 
AND SO MICHAEL SAID THAT'S ALL RIGHT I'LL GO AND SEE HER 
SO HE PUT ON HIS GUMBOOTS AND A COAT AND A HAT GRABBED AN UMBRELLA 
AND TRUDGED OUT THROUGH THE DRIVING RAIN AND THE MUD 
AND EVENTUALLY FOUND THIS LADY AT THE FAR END OF THE CAR PARK AND HAD A GOOD CHAT WITH HER 
FINALLY HE SAID IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I'VE GOT TO GO BACK INSIDE TO DO SOME MORE FILMING 
AND THE LADY REPLIED YES OF COURSE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING TO SEE ME 
IT'S REALLY MADE MY DAY 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF YOUR GREATEST FANS MR. PARKINSON 
OH IS THIS THE CAVALRY 
MAYBE WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE OOH I SEE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO ON THERE 
HAVE YOU SPOTTED THAT YES WE HAVE 
NOT AS OLD AS YOU THOUGH OH I DON'T KNOW 
ONLY ABOUT THREE YEARS OUT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER MY FATHER BUT IT'S GOING BACK A LONG TIME WHEN 
YOU AND HE WERE EVACUATED TOGETHER DURING THE WAR TO CHARD 
WHAT'S HIS NAME IT'S PETER PETER DODD 
PETER DODD PETER DODD 
LITTLE DODDY CLIPPED HIM ROUND THE EAR ONCE 
WELL FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT BECAUSE THERE'S A STORY THERE 
HIS SISTER BARBARA WAS ALSO EVACUATED WITH HIM 
AND SHE CLEARLY RECALLS YOU PUNCHING HIM IN THE NOSE 
AND ACTUALLY HE WASN'T SMALL AT ALL 
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SMALL I MUST HAVE BEEN VERY BRAVE THEN 
MUST HAVE BEEN I WISH IT WAS TRUE 
LISTEN I CAN'T RESIST THIS 
THIS IS JOHN SNAGG 
PERHAPS THE EARLY FIFTIES 
THIS IS LONDON 
OH YOUR RECORD CARD 
WHEN YOU WERE WITH US FIFTY YEARS AGO 
NOW I WORKED FOR YOUR FAMILY STORE FOR QUITE SOME TIME AS A SORT OF SALESMAN 
BUT I WAS GETTING INTO BROADCASTING AT THE SAME TIME 
DOWN HERE IN CARDIFF IN THE EARLY FIFTIES 
AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE TIME OFF BY MR. GERALD WHO WAS YOUR 
MY UNCLE YES YOUR UNCLE HE SAID YOU MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN THE B. B. C. AND DAVID MORGAN SO I WENT 
REASON FOR LEAVING ABSENT WITHOUT PERMISSION 
YES HAVE YOU FORGIVEN ME 
OH I THINK AFTER FIFTY YEARS WE CAN FORGIVE YOU 
FROM MICHAEL TO MICHAEL ARE YOU THIS MICHAEL YES YES YES 
AND THAT'S ME WHEN WAS THIS 
NINETEEN FIFTY NINE FIFTY NINE 
THAT'S BEFORE I WENT BLOND 
YOU CAN SEE A FEW PEOPLE THAT WE WORKED WITH 
BOB DOUGALL WHO RAN THE WHOLE OF THE NEWSREADERS 
RICHARD BAKER DICKIE 
AND THE LOVELY ME ON THE END 
WITH A GLASS IN YOUR HAND 
STRANGE THAT CAN'T BE 
WHICH DO YOU THINK WOULD EMBARRASS HIM MOST 
UM I THINK THE ONE WITH TONY BLACKBURN 
TONY YES GREAT SUIT TOO MARVELLOUS HAIR 
WHAT IS THIS MY NAME TAKEN IN VAIN 
WELL WE'VE BEEN ADMIRING YOU PAST AND PRESENT 
ADMIRING I MEAN I DO WEAR A WIG THEY'RE RIGHT 
THEY USED TO SAY I WORE A WIG AND I DO 
IN T. V. YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME WHEN THE DIRECTORS 
LIKE POLICEMEN START TO LOOK A LOT YOUNGER 
CUT NOT BAD MR. A DON'T CALL US THOUGH WE'LL CALL YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'LL FIND ME AT THE DAY CENTRE CARRY ON 
A VISIT TO THE ROADSHOW CAN BE MANY THINGS 
IT CAN BE A PLEASANT DAY OUT WITH A GOOD RESULT 
IT CAN BE A PLEASANT DAY OUT WITH NOT SUCH GOOD RESULTS 
OR SIMPLY A PLEASANT DAY OUT 
OCCASIONALLY IT CAN BE SOMETHING DEEPER 
A DAY OF REVELATIONS AND SELF DISCOVERY 
IN FACT PAUL YOU ARE KNOWN TO SOME PEOPLE AS DOCTOR ATTERBURY THERAPIST 
DO YOU GO ALONG WITH THAT WELL IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD IT 
BUT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT WE ARE IN THE SOCIAL SERVICES 
NEVER QUITE SURE HOW BUT WE FIT IN SOMEWHERE 
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WE ARE DEALING WITH FAMILY STORIES 
AND IN MANY CASES PEOPLE COME TO US EITHER WITH QUESTIONS 
OR WITH STORIES THAT NEED EXPLANATION 
AND OUR JOB IS TO HELP THEM COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR OWN PAST 
I THINK SO MUCH OF THE ROADSHOW IS NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT OBJECTS 
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IS GET BEHIND THOSE OBJECTS AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON 
NOT NECESSARILY WITH THE OWNER BUT IN THE OWNER'S HISTORY 
CAN YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE 
YES THERE'S ONE I REMEMBER PARTICULARLY IT WAS WAKEHURST PLACE 
IN SUSSEX I THINK AND A CHAP CAME IN ABOUT MY AGE 
WHO HAD A HUGE COLLECTION OF MEMORABILIA TO DO WITH THE TOWN OF LEWES 
DURING HIS LIFETIME MY FATHER MADE A HUGE COLLECTION OF LEWES MEMORABILIA 
AND HE DEVELOPED AN INTEREST IN THE HISTORY OF THE TOWN 
WHICH I'M BOUND TO SAY HE BECAME QUITE AN EXPERT 
IN THE COURSE OF HIS NINETY SIX YEARS AND SO HE WROTE THESE BOOKS 
HE WROTE BOOKS ON THE HISTORY OF LEWES THE STREET NAMES OF LEWES 
SO HE WAS VERY MUCH MR. LEWES 
HE WAS INDEED AND PEOPLE USED TO CALL HIM THAT 
HE HAD POSTCARDS AND PHOTOGRAPHS AND BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS 
THE WHOLE HISTORY WAS SPREAD OUT ON THE TABLE AND THE SON HAD COME ALONG TO SAY WHAT DO I DO 
I'M PUZZLED AS TO WHAT I SHOULD DO WITH IT 
WHAT DO YOU FEEL YOU SHOULD DO 
UM I FEEL IT DESERVES TO BE IN THE HANDS OF SOMEONE WHO WILL USE IT 
PROBABLY MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN I AM ABLE TO DO 
I THINK IT WOULD BE A PITY IF IT JUST RESIDED IN ONE OF MY CUPBOARDS AND GATHERED DUST 
AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN 
YES WELL MY CHILDREN ARE NOT LEWESIANS IN THE SAME SENSE 
SO THEY DON'T WANT IT I THINK IT'S UNLIKELY 
AND I WAS ABLE IN THAT CASE TO SAY TO HIM MY PERSONAL VIEW 
IS THAT THIS IS GREAT STUFF BUT YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION 
WE ARE UNDER COLLECTIVELY NO OBLIGATION TO KEEP WHAT OUR FAMILY HAS GIVEN US IF WE DON'T LIKE IT 
IF YOU LIKE IT THAT'S FINE IF YOUR CHILDREN WANT IT PERFECT 
THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY IS IT WOULD BE A GREAT PITY IF IT WAS BROKEN UP 
INDEED I MEAN IF YOU SAY O. K. HERE ARE THREE HUNDRED POSTCARDS 
SCATTER THEM TO THE WINDS 
YES YOU'RE UNDOING EVERYTHING HE SPENT HIS LIFE DOING THAT'S RIGHT 
SO THERE IS AN IMPORTANCE IN KEEPING THE INTEGRITY 
OF THE COLLECTION TOGETHER BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE IT 
WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT ADVICE AND FOR YOUR ENTHUSIASM 
I LOVE IT I MEAN A PHOTOGRAPH LIKE THAT IF I SAW THAT IN A FAIR 
I'D BUY THAT EVEN IF I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS LEWES 
I JUST THINK IT'S SUCH A GREAT IMAGE YES 
AND I'M SURE THERE ARE MANY MORE OH THERE ARE 
I REMEMBER HE SEEMED TO BE VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR ADVICE 
YES DID HE ACT ON IT WELL I SUPPOSE THIS IS DOCTOR ATTERBURY SPEAKING YOU KNOW 
HE IN THE PROCESS OF DISPOSING OF IT HAD KEPT SCANS 
IMAGES OF EVERYTHING INTERESTING AND HE NOW IN TURN IS BECOMING MR. LEWES 
HE GOES ROUND GIVING TALKS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF LEWES BECAUSE HE IS SITTING ON ALL THE INFORMATION 
SO HIS LIFE WAS CHANGED NOT IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY 
BUT I THINK HE FELT QUITE HAPPY AND RELAXED ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE COULD DO IT 
I ALSO REMEMBER ONE OF THE STRONGEST KIND OF FAMILY STORIES 
WAS WHEN THAT CHAP BROUGHT THE CREE INDIAN STUFF IN 
THAT LINKED BACK TO HIS OWN GRANDMOTHER AND HE HAD NO REAL IDEA 
THAT WAS EXMOUTH AND THAT WAS TO ME SUCH A POWERFUL MOMENT 
WELL I FIRST REMEMBER THIS STUFF AS A CHILD 
WE USED TO PLAY WITH IT MY BROTHER AND MY SISTER AND I 
AND UM MY GRANDFATHER TRAVELLED FROM SCOTLAND WHEN HE WAS AGED EIGHTEEN 
TO WORK FOR THE HUDSON BAY COMPANY IN CANADA AS AN APPRENTICE CLERK 
WHAT SORT OF DATE 
ER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AROUND ABOUT NINETEEN TEN I THINK 
AND HE EVENTUALLY MANAGED THE TRADING POST IN CHURCHILL 
HE MARRIED A CREE INDIAN LADY HANG ON STOP THERE 
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY UNUSUAL AT THE TIME 
ER WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT 
IT WAS NOT THE DONE THING DID HE EVER COME BACK WITH HER 
ER NO HE CAME ON LEAVE BACK TO STAY WITH FAMILY IN SCOTLAND ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS 
BUT DIDN'T BRING HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WITH HIM BUT SHE WAS YOUR GRANDMOTHER 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
AND THIS STUFF WAS THEN BROUGHT BACK TO BRITAIN 
BY HER SONS AFTER THE GRANDFATHER HAD DIED 
SO THOSE CHILDREN SMALL BOYS 
WERE RIPPED AWAY FROM THEIR MOTHER AND THEIR WHOLE CULTURE 
AND BROUGHT BACK AND BROUGHT UP IN SCOTLAND OR WHEREVER IT WAS AND 
I FOUND IT QUITE HARD KEEPING THAT ITEM GOING BECAUSE I WAS SO AGHAST AT WHAT I WAS HEARING 
THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF HER 
WITH MY FATHER AND MY UNCLE RODDY SO YOU JUST HAD THIS PHOTOGRAPH 
THAT'S ALL WE HAD WAS THE PHOTOGRAPH AND THE BEADWORK 
SO IN EFFECT YOU'RE A QUARTER CREE AREN'T YOU YEAH ABSOLUTELY YES 
HAVE YOU ALWAYS FELT PROUD OF THAT I HAVE PERSONALLY 
BUT MY FATHER NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT 
I THINK AT THE TIME HE GREW UP IT WAS SHAMEFUL IT WAS YEAH IT WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE 
I REMEMBER SAYING I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AN ORDER 
YOU HAVE TO GO TO CANADA MORE IMPORTANT YOUR CHILDREN HAVE TO GO TO CANADA 
YOU CANNOT BRING THEM UP NOT KNOWING ABOUT THEIR BACKGROUND 
HE SORT OF NODDED AND SAID YES YOU'RE RIGHT 
THE IDEA HAD NEVER ENTERED HIS MIND AS FAR AS I COULD SEE 
YOU'LL FIND YOU FIT IN YOU KNOW IT'S YOUR TRADITION IT'S YOUR BACKGROUND IT'S YOUR CULTURE YEAH 
I SAT BACK AND I REMEMBER THINKING GOD HOW DID I GET THROUGH THAT 
BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH POWERFUL STUFF AS IT SOMETIMES IS 
I ALMOST FELT WATCHING IT THAT I WANTED TO TAKE A CAMERA 
AND GO BACK TO CANADA WITH HIM AND SEE IT ALL WHAT HAPPENED 
I GATHER THAT ALTHOUGH HE HASN'T BEEN TO CANADA 
HE HASN'T ACTUALLY CARRIED OUT MY ORDERS YET 
BUT HE'S BEEN IN TOUCH THROUGH VARIOUS SOURCES CANADIAN WEBSITES 
AND HE'S ACTUALLY GOT IN TOUCH WITH HIS FAMILY 
SO THE LADY APPARENTLY MARRIED AGAIN 
THERE'S ANOTHER FAMILY OUT THERE AND HE NOW IS AT LEAST IN EMAIL CONTACT 
WITH A WHOLE SIDE OF HIS FAMILY HE DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED 
AND I'M SURE IN DUE COURSE HE WILL GO 
THAT IS POTENTIALLY A LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW 
THEY MAY REALISE THAT THEY ARE AS MUCH CANADIAN AS THEY ARE BRITISH 
WONDERFUL STORIES WHICH PROVES THE ROADSHOW WORKS ON SO MANY LEVELS 
AND VALUATION IS JUST ONE OF THEM 
YES SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THEY'VE COME AND THAT'S OUR JOB TO TELL THEM 
WHEN I FIRST MET MICHAEL HE LOOKED ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTED 
IT WAS OVER DINNER AND HE CONFIDED IN ME THAT 
HE'D TAKEN WHAT HE THOUGHT WERE A COUPLE OF HEADACHE PILLS 
ONLY TO FIND OUT LATER THAT THEY WERE SLEEPING PILLS 
AND IT WAS AN ENORMOUS TRIBUTE TO THE MAN THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS 
I SAW HIM WITH ALL HIS ZEAL AND ALL HIS ENERGY BUT OCCASIONALLY 
THE SENTENCES WOULDN'T END AND OCCASIONALLY THE EYES WOULD DROP 
AND I REMEMBER THINKING AFTERWARDS THAT'S THE MARK OF A PROFESSIONAL 
A MAN WHO CAN WORK IN HIS SLEEP 
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW WE'LL OFTEN MEET IN THE BAR 
MICHAEL PREFERS A PINT TO A CHEAP GLASS OF WINE I PREFER A PINT 
AND STANDING HAVING A CHAT 
HE'LL NEVER MENTION ANY OF THE A LIST CELEBRITIES 
HE'S MET OVER ALL THE YEARS HE'S JUST A REGULAR BLOKE 
WHAT HE WAS MOST OBSESSED BY WAS HIS BOWELS HE WAS 
AND IF YOU'D SAY NOW LOOK KENNETH HOW ARE YOU ARE YOU WELL 
HE'D SAY OF COURSE I'M NOT WELL 
WELL IF ONLY WE COULD DANCE AT THE SAME TIME 
YOU HAD TO HAVE A LICENCE FOR A CIGARETTE LIGHTER 
AT THAT TIME YES I WAS PULLED UP BY A PLAIN CLOTHES POLICEMAN WHO SHOWED ME HIS BADGE 
AND HANDS UP WHO THINKS I'M NOT PLAYING THIS THING 
THIS IS A NICE PHOTOGRAPH IS THIS A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY 
NO SHE KILLED MY MOTHER'S DOG 
OH 
MEET THE ISLE OF WIGHT AUSTINS 
HELLO EVERYONE HELLO MICHAEL 
JAMES HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A COLLECTOR 
ABOUT SIX YEARS YEAH SIX YEARS 
HOW OLD ARE YOU NOW TEN SO YOU STARTED WHEN YOU WERE FOUR YEAH 
WOW AND YOU'VE GOT A MATE WHO HELPS YOU AROUND AS WELL DON'T YOU 
YEAH WHO'S THAT MY BROTHER HE'S AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE I DON'T KNOW WHERE 
AND IS HE AS KEEN AS YOU ARE NO 
HE'S INTERESTED IN KILLING PEOPLE KILLING PEOPLE 
YES HE JUST LIKES WATCHING PROGRAMMES ABOUT KILLING PEOPLE OH 
DAD'S ARMY THEME TUNE 
AH TWO HAPPY BOYS WITH THEIR FAVOURITE GUNS 
I THOUGH THAT YOU WOULD LIKE IT FOR YOUR FAMILY TO SAY THAT'S WHAT GRANDPA DID 
GRANDPA 
YES YOU NEVER KNOW IN YEARS TO COME GREAT GRANDPA 
YES IT'S HEADING THAT WAY 
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW WAS A BIT LIKE A GOOD BOOK 
IF YOU LIKE HISTORICAL DRAMAS THAT IS 
AND WE HAVE SOME WONDERFUL STORYTELLERS ON THE TEAM 
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT 
I FOUND IT IN MY GARDEN 
JUST CUT SOME HEDGE DOWN AND WAS CLEARING UP THE HEDGE CHIPPINGS 
AND UM I JUST SAW IT LAYING ON THE GROUND AS BRIGHT AS THAT 
THIS PROBABLY BELONGED TO SOME NOBLEMAN POSSIBLY EVEN A KING 
WHO WAS TRAVELLING THROUGH WHAT IS YOUR BACK GARDEN NOW YEAH 
POSSIBLY ON HORSEBACK HIS HANDS WERE COLD IT SLIPPED FROM HIS FINGER 
AND FELL INTO THE GROUND AND THEN DING IT'S GONE 
IMAGINE THE SWEAR WORDS ALL IN ANGLO SAXON 
AND THEN IT LIES THERE FOR HOW MANY YEARS 
MY GOODNESS IN A THOUSAND YEARS THE GROUND CAN'T TOUCH THIS MATERIAL 
IT'S AS BUTTERY AND WONDERFUL TODAY AS IT WAS FOR HIM OR HER 
WHEN SHE LOST IT AND IT'S A PERFECT SOUVENIR OF SOMETHING VERY ENGLISH 
AND SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARILY RARE 
THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST EXCITING THING THAT I'VE EVER FOUND ON THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW 
AND ONE OF THE MOST MOVING THINGS I'VE EVER FOUND 
AND I COULDN'T BE MORE THRILLED TO DISCOVER IT AT THE END OF OUR DAY 
AND SO I'M GOING TO TELL YOU 
THAT I THINK YOU SHOULD GO HOME AND INSURE IT FOR TEN THOUSAND REALLY 
I WAS TOLD A THOUSAND BY A FRIEND A WHILE AGO 
BUT I NEVER IMAGINED TEN THOUSAND NO THAT'S AMAZING 
IT'S ALL IN THE INITIALS ISN'T IT 
C. R. M. CHARLES RENNIE MACKINTOSH 
WELL THAT WOULDN'T BE BY HIM THOUGH WOULD IT WELL WHY NOT 
THERE'S EVERY REASON IT'S BY HIM AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY REALLY 
THE DATE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE 
NOW IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY MACKINTOSH WAS GIVEN SIXTY 
AS A PRIZE TOWARDS A SKETCHING TRIP 
WHICH HE DECIDED TO TAKE IN ITALY 
SO HE SET OFF AT THE END OF MARCH IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE 
AND YOU SEE THAT HE'S ACTUALLY TITLED IT THE LATERM ROME 
BUT WHAT IS EXCITING FOR ME 
IS THAT I'M YOU KNOW I'M JUST THIS DISTANCE AWAY FROM THIS GREAT MAN 
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT MACKINTOSH'S WORK FOR THE BEST PART OF THIRTY YEARS 
HE'S STILL AN ENIGMA TO ME 
HE DID HAVE SUCH A CAREFUL EYE AND IT'S THIS ATTENTION TO DETAIL 
AND BALANCED DESIGN THAT JUST MADE HIM YOU KNOW 
ONE OF THE MASTER ARCHITECTS OF THE LATE NINETEENTH AND EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY 
AND YOU THINK IT IS CHARLES RENNIE MACKINTOSH 
I'VE GOT NO REASON TO DOUBT IT WHATSOEVER 
IT JUST BEGS THE QUESTION AT THE MOMENT 
OF WHAT ELSE IS LURKING IN YOUR ATTIC 
GEOFFREY AND ERIC THERE YOU ARE DOING YOUR STUFF AS EVER 
BEING ALL POETIC TAKING US TO ANOTHER PLACE AND TIME 
IS THAT ALL AD LIB OR DO YOU SORT OF REHEARSE IT IN YOUR MIND FIRST 
WELL PERSONALLY I DON'T THERE ISN'T TIME REALLY TO REHEARSE IT 
BECAUSE ONE GETS UP FROM THE TABLE HAVING SEEN THE PUBLIC 
AND THEN STRAIGHT TO THE CAMERAS AND IT'S LIKE A SORT OF MAD DANCE 
THE MUSIC'S COMING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE 
AND YOUR DANCE PARTNER IS PROBABLY VERY NERVOUS 
AND IS GOING TO LEAD YOU IN DIRECTIONS AS WELL 
MAYBE DIRECTIONS YOU HADN'T ANTICIPATED 
SO NO MATTER HOW HARD ONE TRIES TO REHEARSE THINGS IT GOES IN ANOTHER DIRECTION 
I DON'T PREPARE IT IN ANY WAY DO YOU ERIC WELL YES NO AND YES 
BECAUSE I'LL ALWAYS LOOK AT THE OBJECT 
AND I'LL LOOK FOR AN OPENING LINE AND TRY AND THINK OF AN OUT LINE 
AS FOR THE OTHER NINETY NINE PER CENT I JUST LEAVE IT ENTIRELY TO WHATEVER HAPPENS 
LIKE YOURSELF IT'S JUST A NATURAL SORT OF CONVERSATION 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT DECO FIGURES IS 
FOR SOME REASON BEST KNOWN TO THE MODELLERS THE SCULPTORS OF THE DAY 
ALWAYS SHOW THEM STANDING ON ONE LEG DON'T THEY 
WELL THAT'S HOW WE ALWAYS STAND US WOMEN IS THAT IS THAT RIGHT 
OH GOD YES 
WHEN WE'RE EXCITED WE ALWAYS GO ON ONE LEG YES HAVE YOU NOT NOTICED 
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T GOT A WOMAN EXCITED ERIC NO NO WELL THERE YOU GO 
WELL I'LL PAY MORE ATTENTION IN FUTURE EXACTLY YES 
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT RUDE TO LOOK DOWN WHEN I'M TALKING TO SOMEBODY IN THE EYE YEAH ANYWAY 
SO IN A PERFECT SITUATION WE'VE GOT THE OBJECT WE'VE GOT THE VALUATION 
OF COURSE AND A GOOD STORY 
HOW IMPORTANT IS THE OWNER HIMSELF OR HERSELF IN THIS EQUATION 
I THINK ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL FRANKLY AND WE LOOK FOR ALL KINDS OF THINGS 
WE LOOK FOR A SENSE OF HUMOUR WE LOOK FOR CHARM AND WE MIGHT LOOK FOR ECCENTRICITY 
A CERTAIN WARMTH PERHAPS SOMETHING DIFFERENT REALLY 
AND AND AND IT IS I THINK REALLY A PROGRAMME ABOUT PEOPLE 
JUST AS MUCH AS OBJECTS MORE ABOUT PEOPLE THAN OBJECTS AND WHEN IT WORKS OUT IT'S VERY GOOD 
THERE IS AN ELEMENT SOMETIMES OF LEADING THEM ON ISN'T THERE 
DRAWING THEM OUT I THINK ONE DOES LEAD THEM ON BECAUSE THERE HAS TO BE AN ELEMENT OF SURPRISE 
IT'S SOMETIMES LINKED TO THE VALUE AND SOMETIMES IT ISN'T 
THIS PINK HEART HERE THIS THROBBING LITTLE PINK HEART 
WITH DIAMONDS IS MADE BY CARL FABERGE 
IT ISN'T IT IS IT CAN'T BE 
IT IS IT JOLLY WELL IS 
COURT JEWELLER TO NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA 
MAKER OF THE IMPERIAL EASTER EGGS 
PATRONISED BY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF QUEEN VICTORIA'S DESCENDANTS 
IT'S A LITTLE LOVE JEWEL 
FOR A MAN TO GIVE TO A GIRL AS AN EMBLEM OF HIS LOVE 
IT'S DECORATED WITH OPALESCENT ENAMEL 
AND I DON'T THINK THERE WOULD BE ANY CHANCE OF YOU ACQUIRING THIS JEWEL 
UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES FOR LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND TODAY 
WHAT ONE TRIES TO DO IS TO GENTLY GENTLY GENTLY REVEAL TO THEM 
THAT THIS OBJECT IS REVEALING SOMETHING ABOUT ALL OUR PASTS 
THAT THEY'RE SILENT WITNESSES AND THAT'S THE GAME I LIKE TO PLAY 
AND LET THAT EVOLVE DURING A CONVERSATION 
I THINK THE BUZZ THAT I GET FROM THIS IS PRIMARILY 
TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN THE OBJECT TO THE CLIENT 
AND THEN FOR THEM TO LOOK AT IT WITH NEW EYES REALLY 
BUT THE RAPPORT THAT YOU HOPE TO ESTABLISH BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THE OWNER 
SOMETIMES YOU FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GET A WORD IN I'VE NOTICED 
IT CAN HAPPEN AND THAT'S NOT ABSOLUTELY A PERFECT OWNER IS IT 
BECAUSE IT MUST BE A DIALOGUE FRANKLY AND I THINK THEY'RE UNDERSTANDABLY NERVOUS 
AND MY ADVANTAGE REALLY IS THE THINGS THAT I DEAL WITH ARE INTENSELY PERSONAL 
AND THEY'RE OFTEN OWNED BY WOMEN SO I CAN BE A LITTLE BIT SORT OF TOUCHY FEELY 
AND PUT MY HAND ON THEIR BACK AND CALM THEM DOWN BEFORE THE BROADCAST AND IT HELPS ENORMOUSLY 
I EXPLAIN TO THEM IF THEY JUST DROP THEIR SHOULDERS AND BREATHE A LITTLE AND IT'LL HELP AND THEY DO 
GOLD BRACELET DIAMOND RING DIAMOND BRACELET DIAMOND RING 
AND YOU'RE A JEWELLERY GROUPIE AREN'T YOU 
WELL JEWELLERY HOLIC JEWELLERY HOLIC 
JEWELLERY HOLIC I THINK AND HOW DO YOU FEED THIS HABIT 
IT STARTED WHEN I WAS VERY VERY TINY 
I CAN REMEMBER AS A VERY VERY SMALL GIRL IF I'D BEEN NAUGHTY 
AND WAS ALLOWED A REWARD AFTERWARDS THE THING I ASKED TO DO WAS MUMMY'S JEWELLERY BOX 
WHICH WAS AN OLD CHOCOLATE BOX IN THOSE DAYS 
NO GOD YES IT STARTED WHEN I WAS FIVE OR SIX 
FED THAT HABIT AND YOU'VE BROUGHT US TWO GORGEOUS DIAMOND JEWELS HERE 
AREN'T THEY MARVELLOUS ARE YOU THRILLED WITH THEM 
I'M VERY THRILLED WITH THEM BUT THERE'S ROOM FOR MORE VERY GOOD 
HE'S GOT SUCH A SILVER TONGUE I MEAN I WENT TO THE FRED DIBNAH SCHOOL OF ELECUTION 
IT'S NOT WHERE YOU START FROM IT'S WHERE YOU END UP ISN'T IT 
I'M THE SAME WITH PEOPLE FOR US WE DO IT ON A REGULAR BASIS 
FOR THEM IT'S A ONCE IN A LIFETIME THING AND WE SAY LOOK IT'S JUST ME AND YOU 
FORGET ABOUT THESE PEOPLE 
I ACTUALLY TELL THEM THAT THE CAMERAMEN ARE ALL THERE ON YOUTH OPPORTUNITY SCHEMES YOU KNOW 
AND UM YOU KNOW IT'S A DAY OUT FOR YOU BUT IT'S A CAREER FOR ME 
IF YOU WANTED TO REPLACE THIS TODAY 
I'D PROBABLY HAVE TO WRITE A CHEQUE OUT FOR A MINIMUM OF 
LET'S SAY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS REALLY REALLY 
TWENTY FIVE GOSH THAT'S A SURPRISE A NICE SURPRISE 
BUT NOTHING TO YOU PEOPLE IN SYDNEY 
A WOMAN LIKE YOU POCKET MONEY 
I KNOW THE TYPE 
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE BRITISH VIEWER THAT'S A TEN THOUSAND LAMPSHADE 
BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING IT ALONG TODAY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS WONDERFUL 
ARE WE FILMING NOW BECAUSE WE WATCH THE ANTIQUE ROADSHOW YOU DO 
YES WE DO AND WE FEEL WE KNOW PEOPLE AND 
THAT'S SO FORTUITOUS BECAUSE I'VE GOT NOWHERE 
NOWHERE TO EAT AND SLEEP TONIGHT SO IF I COULD EAT AT YOUR PLACE 
WE'LL LIGHT THE LAMP FOR YOU WELL LOOK AT THAT CAN YOU SEE THAT YES IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
I MEANT TO DO THAT EARLIER THEY'VE STOPPED RECORDING NOW 
I WAS DESCRIBED THE OTHER DAY IN A MAGAZINE AS A WORLD AUTHORITY 
AND I SAID THAT'S A BIT MUCH COULDN'T YOU SAY 
UNIVERSAL INSTEAD YOU KNOW IT'S MORE ENCOMPASSING ISN'T IT 
THE IDEA FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW IS TO HAVE FUN ER YES 
AND WE DO WELL WE CERTAINLY DO ON MY TABLE ANYWAY 
I MEAN EVEN IF WE'RE NOT RECORDING WITH SOMEBODY 
I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW IT'S DAFT 
BUT IF SOMEONE PUTS A JUG IN FRONT OF YOU OR A TEAPOT 
I'LL SAY OH THAT'S FANTASTIC 
AND THEY SAY WELL WHY WHAT 
I SAY WELL THAT'S THE FIRST LEFT HANDED TEAPOT I'VE HAD TODAY 
THEY GO REALLY AND I SAY HAVE YOU NEVER TRIED IT TRY IT WITH YOUR LEFT HAND 
YEAH AND OH REALLY REALLY THEY THINK YOU'RE MAD NO NO NO 
FOR A MINUTE THEY'RE TAKEN IN THEN AFTER A WHILE THEY REALISE THAT THAT YOU'RE MAD 
YEAH BUT AT LEAST IT RELAXES THEM 
YEAH AND YOU NEED TO RELAX THEM I THINK THEY ARE PARALYSED WITH FEAR 
AND A FEW JOKES HELP THEM ENORMOUSLY AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER 
ANDY WARHOL SAID THAT EVERYBODY'S FAMOUS FOR FIFTEEN 
YOU'VE HAD ANDY WARHOL ON THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW DIDN'T YOU SEE HIM 
HE DID SOME DRAWINGS BUT YOU WEREN'T THERE 
BEFORE MY TIME ANYWAY HE SAID THAT EVERYBODY'S FAMOUS FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES 
AND PEOPLE ARE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THAT BECAUSE THEY KNOW VERY WELL THAT IN TWO OR THREE MONTHS' TIME 
IT'S GOING OUT TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND THEY WANT TO DO IT RIGHT 
SO OUR JOB IS TO REASSURE THEM AND TRY TO MAKE THEM RELAXED 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE DOING IT RIGHT 
YOU'RE SUCH A STAR AT DOING THAT YOU KNOW THAT DON'T YOU 
WELL YOU'RE A CONSTELLATION AREN'T YOU 
WELL YOU'RE A SUPERNOVA THEN OH VERY GOOD OH STOP IT YOU TWO 
YES STOP IT I HAVE TO PAY HIM EVERY TIME HE SAYS THAT M. M. M. 
ANOTHER PERSON WHO LIKES TO HAVE FUN WITH PEOPLE IS LARS THARP 
AS I KNOW ONLY TOO WELL 
WELL MICHAEL FROM THE POURING WEATHER WE HAVE GOT OUTSIDE 
I THOUGHT I HAD TO SHOW YOU THE SELF POURING TEAPOT 
SELF POURING SELF POURING IT'S A WACKY VICTORIAN INVENTION 
IT'S FOR THE ULTIMATE LAZY HOST AND IT'S A CLEVER IDEA 
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE BY DOULTON IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN DAMAGED 
WE'VE GOT A COLLAR PUT THERE 
BUT IT'S GOT THIS EXTRAORDINARY CYLINDER THING 
SO WHEN YOU ARE SITTING AT THE TABLE YOU LIFT THE CYLINDER 
THE CYLINDER DISPLACES THE EQUIVALENT VOLUME IN AIR INSIDE 
SO WHEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN IT ACTUALLY POURS THE TEA 
WITHOUT YOUR HAVING TO MOVE THE TEAPOT FORCES IT OUT HERE 
IT FORCES OUT THERE AH 
THANKS VERY MUCH URGH 
EVERY TIME EVERY TIME 
THERE AREN'T MANY SELF RESPECTING BROADCASTERS WHO ALLOW PEOPLE TO POUR TEA OVER THEIR FEET 
I THINK THE PERSON WHO TAKES OVER THE SHOW SHOULD BE WARNED 
SO FIONA BRUCE I AM WARNING YOU HAVE YOU BROUGHT YOUR WELLIES 
I HAVEN'T EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT BRINGING MY WELLIES I WAS THINKING MORE LIKE SUNGLASSES AND STRAW HAT 
I THINK YOU'LL WEAR THE LOT YOU'VE BEEN A FAN FOR A LONG TIME HAVEN'T YOU 
I HAVE I MEAN WHEN I WAS A CHILD I USED TO WATCH IT WITH MUM AND DAD 
I REMEMBER THAT VERY WELL SORT OF REGULAR FIXTURE 
BUT THEN THROUGH MY ADULT LIFE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE 
AND THE STORIES IN IT ARE WHAT ARE SO GREAT 
THE OBJECTS ARE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC AND MANY OF THEM ARE BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR OWN RIGHT 
BUT WHAT'S SO RIVETING I THINK ANYWAY 
IS THE STORIES BEHIND IT AND WHAT THOSE OBJECTS MEAN TO THEM 
AND THE STORIES ABOUT HOW THEY CAME INTO BEING THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT 
YOU'LL BE HEARING THOSE AT FIRST HAND FROM NOW ON I WILL 
SO IT'LL BE A PLEASANT CHANGE I SUPPOSE TO BE OUT OF THE STUDIO 
I'LL SEE A LOT OF THE COUNTRY WHICH WILL BE A PLEASANT CHANGE FOR ME 
AND ALSO I THINK THE THING THAT I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IS 
YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF MY WORKING LIFE IS ABOUT GRIMNESS 
THE NEWS OR CRIMEWATCH ABOUT DEATH AND DESTRUCTION AND WAR AND FAMINE OR WHAT HAVE YOU 
AND SUDDENLY TO BE DOING SOMETHING THAT IS JUST SO MUCH NICER 
WHERE EVERYONE IS HAPPY TO BE THERE PEOPLE ARE SMILING YOU KNOW 
WITH THEIR LOVELY OBJECTS AND YOU'RE TELLING THEM ABOUT THEM IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT 
THEY QUEUE UP THROUGHOUT ANY KIND OF WEATHER THAT'S THE AMAZING THING 
DO YOU GET LOTS OF PEOPLE THROUGH THE DOOR I GUESS YOU MUST 
SOMETIMES THREE AND HALF THOUSAND AND ALWAYS ENOUGH TO DO A SHOW 
SO YOU KNOW IT'LL WORK EVERY TIME 
I'M DAUNTED I MUST SAY ABOUT TAKING ON SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE DONE SO BRILLIANTLY FOR SO LONG 
AND A SHOW THAT'S BEEN RUNNING FOR SO LONG 
ONE THING I WANTED TO ASK YOU WAS I MEAN I LIKE POKING AROUND ANTIQUE SHOPS AND GOING TO AUCTIONS 
BUT DO YOU HAVE TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT ANTIQUES 
HOW MUCH DID YOU KNOW ABOUT ANTIQUES WHEN YOU STARTED 
WELL I WOULD SAY ROUGHLY NOTHING 
THE POINT IS I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING I WAS KEEN 
ALWAYS INTERESTED WATCHED THE SHOW AS YOU DID BUT KNEW VERY LITTLE 
BUT BY A KIND OF PROCESS OF OSMOSIS 
YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF THE EXPERTS 
AND YOU BEGIN TO TAKE AN INTEREST BEYOND WHAT YOU'D EVER SEEN BEFORE 
YOU BEGIN TO KNOW WHAT'S OLD AND WHAT MIGHT BE WORTH A FEW BOB 
I'VE GOT THE DATES THROUGH FOR THE FIRST SHOWS FOR THIS YEAR 
OH GOOD BECAUSE MY FIRST SHOW WAS AT BARNSTAPLE IN DEVON 
WHERE'S YOUR FIRST CHESTER CATHEDRAL 
YOU KNOW THE GOOD THING ABOUT CATHEDRALS THEY'RE DRY 
OF COURSE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT ISN'T IT OH YES HONESTLY 
BUT WHEN IT'S US AGAINST THE ELEMENTS THAT'S MORE FUN I FOUND 
THAN JUST DOING A STRAIGHTFORWARD SHOW 
WHEN THE SKY SUDDENLY OPENS AND YOU ALL HEAD FOR THE TENT 
OR THE MARQUEE AS WE GRANDLY CALL IT 
IT GETS MORE FUN THEN YOU HAVE TO START AD LIBBING AROUND THIS DESPERATE SITUATION 
AND YOU'LL LIKE THAT BEING A LIVE BROADCASTER 
IT'S FUN I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT AND I LOVE CHESTER 
I USED TO GO THERE WITH MY MOTHER SHOPPING IT'LL BE NICE TO DO THAT 
AND ISN'T THERE ONE DATE I'VE HEARD A WHISPER THAT YOU HAVE A REAL CONNECTION WITH 
THERE IS AND THIS IS REALLY EXCITING 
HERTFORD COLLEGE OXFORD WHERE I STUDIED 
WE'RE DOING A ROADSHOW THERE IN THE QUAD 
WHICH IS A BEAUTIFUL LOCATION IT'S WHERE EVELYN WAUGH STUDIED AS WELL 
MY ABIDING MEMORY IS TRYING TO SLEEP WHILE HORDES OF JAPANESE TOURISTS 
TRAIPSED ROUND TO SEE HIS ROOM SO IT'LL BE FANTASTIC TO SEE THAT ALL LAID OUT FOR THE ROADSHOW 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT AND THEN THE SAGE CENTRE GATESHEAD 
WHERE WE'RE DOING A ROADSHOW ABOUT MODERN COLLECTABLES 
WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY EVERYTHING SINCE POST WAR THE KIND OF STUFF 
YOU SEE AROUND YOUR GRANDPARENTS' HOME I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT 
AND IN FACT IF PEOPLE HAVE ANYTHING THAT THEY WANT TO BRING 
OR THEY'RE THINKING MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THE PROGRAMME 
THEY CAN EMAIL US OR CONTACT US 
WELL I WISH YOU FUN AND GOOD LUCK WITH THAT ONE AND ALL THE OTHER LOVELY DATES YOU'VE GOT LINED UP 
I CAN'T WAIT THANK YOU SO MUCH 
WELL AS JULIET SAID TO ROMEO AND PETE SAID TO DUD 
PARTING IS SUCH SWEET SORROW BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO SAY GOODBYE 
WHICH SADLY I MUST NOW DO 
LET ME JUST SAY THAT MY WORKING ON THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW 
HAS BEEN AN HONOUR 
AND I HOPE THEY APPRECIATE IT 
NO LET ME TRY THAT ONE AGAIN 
O. K. HAND ON HEART 
IN A LONG AND VARIED CAREER 
WORKING ON THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW HAS BEEN AS GOOD AS IT GETS 
GOODBYE 
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE PERSON ON THE ROADSHOW

AND HE VALUES EVERYONE ELSE'S CONTRIBUTIONS 
WE'RE GOING TO MISS HIM HE'S A LOVELY LOVELY MAN

IT'S NOW JUST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE AFTERNOON AND STILL PEOPLE ARE TURNING UP 
AT THIS RATE THE EXPERTS WILL BE HERE UNTIL AT LEAST MIDNIGHT 
AND ELOQUENCE LIKE A FLIGHT OF DOVES 
WHEN TO THE HOOK THE SALMON SPRINGS 
AND THE LINE WHISTLES THROUGH THE RINGS 
AND INSPIRATION REACHING FOR THE STARS 
WOW AND ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW TEAM MAY I SAY 
GIVE US A KISS 
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE NO FREELOADERS 
OUT TO GET THEIR KICKS 
WHEN IT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS 
THE WAY THAT YOU WANNA LIVE 
I JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER 
THERE'LL BE DAYS LIKE THIS 
OH YES MY GOODNESS IT'S WET 
WHEN NO ONE STEPS ON MY DREAMS WHERE AM I 
WHEN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN THERE'LL BE DAYS LIKE THIS 
WHEN YOU RING OUT THE CHANGES
