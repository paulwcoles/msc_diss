BUT ADD TO THAT THE STRESS OF TAKING ON A SELF SUFFICIENT 
COUNTRY LIFESTYLE AT THE SAME TIME AMBITIOUS OR CRAZY 
THE STREETS OF NOTTINGHAM ARE NEVER EMPTY 
WITH MORE AND MORE PEOPLE FLOCKING TO THE AREA FOR ITS GROWING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES 
AND INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT LINKS 
BUT ON TOP OF THAT IT'S THE PLACE FOR RETAIL THERAPY 
NEARLY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND SHOPPERS HIT THE STREETS EVERY WEEK 
NOT SURPRISINGLY RETAILERS ARE QUEUING UP FOR A PIECE OF THE ACTION 
SIX HUNDRED COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR PREMISES HERE 
WITH NEARLY ONE MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN AND AROUND THE CITY 
THE CENTRE IS A FLURRY OF PEOPLE TRAFFIC AND TRAMS 
PROPERTY IS AFFORDABLE HERE 
PRICES BEING TWENTY PER CENT LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE 
BUT FOR MARK AND VANESSA SMITHSON THE BIRTH OF THEIR FIRST CHILD HAS MEANT A CHANGE OF PRIORITIES 
THEIR MOVE TO THE COUNTRY IS AS MUCH ABOUT LIVING A GREENER LIFESTYLE AS LIVING IN A GREENER SETTING 
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE'RE REALLY GREEN BUT ALL WE HAVE CHANCE TO DO 
IS RECYCLE AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND USE ENERGY EFFICIENT LIGHT BULBS 
WHEN WE MOVE TO THE COUNTRY I'D LIKE US TO TO GENERATE OUR OWN ENERGY 
MAYBE USING SOLAR OR WIND AND THEN WE'D LIKE TO GROW OUR OWN VEGETABLES 
SO REALLY WE NEED A LOT MORE SPACE OUTSIDE THAN WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT NOW 
THE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR GARDEN IS IT BACKS ON TO THE LOCAL PARK 
HANDY FOR THE FAMILY DOG WILLOW AND FOR BABY DREW BUT A CITY PARK 
ISN'T THE COUNTRYSIDE HAVEN VANESSA WANTS TO BRING UP HER FAMILY IN 
I DO ENJOY LIVING AROUND HERE WITH THE PLAYGROUPS FOR DREW 
AND SWIMMING BUT IT'S NOT THE COUNTRYSIDE FOR US 
WE FEEL THAT WE NEED A SAFER ENVIRONMENT FOR HER FOR WHEN SHE GROWS UP 
AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS ISN'T THE COUNTRYSIDE WHAT WE'RE AFTER 
MARK AND VANESSA BOUGHT THEIR HOME SIX YEARS AGO FOR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
BUT WITH THE PROPERTY MARKET HERE BOOMING FASTER THAN MUCH OF THE U. K. 
WHAT'S THEIR SUBURBAN HOME WORTH NOW 
THE FRONT DOOR LEADS TO A PORCH AND HALL 
WHICH LEADS ON TO THE TWO RECEPTION ROOMS ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
A LIVING ROOM AND A SPACIOUS DINING ROOM WHICH MARK ALSO USES AS HIS STUDY 
THE PROPERTY BENEFITS FROM A THROUGH LOUNGE DINING ROOM 
WHICH IS LIGHT AND SPACIOUS AND LEADS TO DECKING IN THE REAR GARDEN 
THE BACK GARDEN IS A GOOD SIZE WITH DECKED AND LAWN AREAS 
THEN IT'S BACK IN TO THE NARROW GALLEY STYLE KITCHEN 
BACK THROUGH THE HALL IS THE STAIRCASE UP TO THE FIRST FLOOR 
AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE THERE'S A FAMILY BATHROOM RIGHT NEXT TO THE MASTER BEDROOM 
IT'S A GENEROUSLY PROPORTIONED MASTER BEDROOM 
WITH PLEASANT VIEWS OVER THE PARK TO THE REAR 
A GREAT ASPECT TO WAKE UP TO 
ON TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE IS A FURTHER GOOD SIZED DOUBLE ROOM 
AND A SMALLER THIRD BEDROOM USED AS A NURSERY 
SO MARK AND VANESSA FIRST OF ALL I'VE HAD SOME VALUATIONS DONE 
ON YOUR PROPERTY HERE AND THE AGENTS RECKON YOU COULD GET 
IN A RANGE FROM ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE THOUSAND UP TO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
YOU'RE ON THE MARKET ALREADY SO HOW MUCH IS IT ON FOR VANESSA 
IT'S ON FOR ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND IF YOU GET THAT HOW MUCH MONEY WILL YOU HAVE MADE IN THE TIME THAT YOU'VE HAD IT 
MADE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
THAT'S NICE IN SIX YEARS ISN'T IT THAT'S GOOD ISN'T IT 
SO MARK WHAT'S THE BUDGET WE'VE GOT A MAXIMUM BUDGET OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
SO FIRST THINGS FIRST IN TERMS OF YOUR SEARCH VANESSA WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO MOVE TO 
WE'D LIKE TO MOVE IN BETWEEN NEWARK AND LINCOLN NOT TOO FAR FROM WORK 
AND NOT TOO FAR FROM THE PARENTS 
MARK I KNOW YOU'VE GOT THIS ECO FRIENDLY DREAM 
SO TELL ME WHAT IDEALLY YOU'D LIKE TO FIND IN A HOUSE 
SOLAR PANELS OR MAYBE A WIND TURBINE 
I THINK THE CHANCES OF ME FINDING FOUR PROPERTIES THAT HAVE GOT THAT KIND OF EQUIPMENT ARE QUITE REMOTE 
SO WOULD YOU BE UP FOR PUTTING IT IN YOURSELVES 
AS LONG AS THERE'S SPACE TO BE ABLE TO PUT THE THINGS IN THEN THAT WOULD BE PERFECT 
RIGHT LET'S THINK ABOUT THE HOUSE ITSELF VANESSA GIVE ME YOUR ESSENTIALS LIST 
I'D LOVE TO HAVE A SEPARATE DINING ROOM AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE A DOWNSTAIRS TOILET 
AND HOW MANY BEDROOMS WE'D LIKE FOUR POSSIBLY FIVE 
AND WHAT ABOUT OUTSIDE SPACE WHAT WOULD BE A MINIMUM SIZE OF GARDEN 
CURRENTLY OUR GARDEN IS ABOUT TEN METRES BY TWENTY 
SO IDEALLY WE'D LIKE IT TO BE TWICE AS LONG AND TWICE AS WIDE 
ANY OTHER ESSENTIALS 
YES WE'D LIKE TO HAVE A STUDY DOWNSTAIRS THAT WOULD BE IDEAL 
WHAT ABOUT BONUSES THINGS YOU WOULD LIKE ON YOUR WISH LIST 
I'D LOVE TO HAVE A UTILITY ROOM JUST TO PUT ALL THE WASHING MACHINE AND DRYER OUT THE WAY 
I'D LIKE A BASEMENT SO THAT MAYBE YOU COULD STORE WINE OR GO BACK TO MAKING OUR OWN WINE COS WE USED TO DO IT 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE BUSY FOLK WHEN YOU MOVE TO THE COUNTRY 
THE SHEEP AND THE CHICKENS AND THE WINE MAKING 
I HAVE TO SAY YOU'VE GOT QUITE A LONG LIST OF THINGS BUT I THINK 
I'VE GOT AN IDEA NOW OF WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR 
YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD BUDGET BECAUSE LINCOLNSHIRE PRICES ARE STILL VERY REASONABLE 
SO YOU TWO JUST NEED TO STAY LOGGED ON NOW 
I'LL SEND YOU BACK PICTURES OF THE HOUSES I'M FINDING 
AND HOPEFULLY I'LL TURN UP THE PERFECT ECO FRIENDLY DREAM COUNTRY HOUSE FOR YOU 
GREAT FANTASTIC 
PHEW MARK AND VANESSA CERTAINLY HAVE VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS 
ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT AND BIG PLANS FOR THEIR NEW LIFE IN THE COUNTRY 
SO THE CONCERN FOR ME IS WHETHER THE PROPERTIES 
I'LL FIND FOR THEM ARE GOING TO LIVE UP TO THEIR ECO FRIENDLY IDEAS 
MARK AND VANESSA HAVE TWO VERY SPECIFIC SIDES TO THEIR WISH LIST 
SO WILL LINCOLNSHIRE COME UP TRUMPS 
THEY HAVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NEED THE SPACE AND THE PRACTICALITY 
OF A TYPICAL FAMILY HOME 
HOWEVER THEY'RE ALSO KEEN TO LEAD AN ECO FRIENDLY EXISTENCE 
SO THEY NEED SPACE FOR VEGETABLE PATCHES ANIMALS 
AND ALL THAT ENERGY SAVING KIT AND KABOODLE 
ONE OF THE LARGEST COUNTIES IN BRITAIN 
LINCOLNSHIRE STRETCHES FOR WELL OVER TWO THOUSAND SQUARE MILES 
NOT THAT IT WAS ALWAYS THIS SIZE 
LOWER LYING MARSHLANDS WERE DRAINED IN THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY 
TO MAKE WAY FOR THREE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES OF EXTRA AGRICULTURAL LAND 
ALL OF WHICH ALSO MAKES IT ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S FLATTEST COUNTIES 
IT'S ON THESE VAST PLAINS THAT IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY A MILITARY BUILDING BOOM TOOK OFF 
THE FLAT TERRAIN PROVIDED READY MADE RUNWAYS FOR PILOTS EARNING IT THE NICKNAME BOMBER COUNTY 
I'M STARTING MY SEARCH IN TWO VILLAGES 
ON TOP OF AN ESCARPMENT THAT RUNS THROUGH CENTRAL LINCOLNSHIRE 
WADDINGTON IS ONE OF THESE SO CALLED CLIFF VILLAGES 
THIS IS THE VIKING WAY A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILE FOOTPATH THAT STRETCHES FROM HUMBERSIDE TO RUTLAND 
FROM THE NINTH CENTURY IT WAS AN IMPORTANT TRADE AND TRANSPORT ROUTE 
WHEN MARK AND VANESSA HAVE TIRED OUT THEIR GREEN FINGERS IN THE GARDEN 
THERE'S PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO STRETCH THEIR LEGS 
WADDINGTON ALSO CATERS WELL FOR DAY TO DAY LIFE 
THERE'S A VILLAGE PRIMARY SCHOOL POST OFFICE AND A PUB 
HILL TOP HOUSE WAS BUILT IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND IS RUMOURED TO BE THE SECOND OLDEST HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE 
IT'S ON SALE FOR NEARLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND RIGHT AT THE TOP OF MY FAMILY'S BUDGET 
BACK IN NOTTINGHAM MARK AND VANESSA KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS VIA THE LAPTOP 
THAT'S NICE 
THAT'S A NICE GARDEN 
THE OWNER ABI ROGERS IS GOING TO SHOW ME AROUND 
SO I JUST WALKED PAST THE LAWNED AREA AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
IS THAT THE GARDEN YES THAT'S THE MAIN GARDEN THERE'S A SMALL ONE AT THE BACK BUT THAT'S THE MAIN GARDEN 
O. K. BRILLIANT I'LL EXPLORE THOSE LATER DO THE HOUSE FIRST WHAT'S DOWN HERE 
THAT'S THE CELLAR IT LOOKS A VERY GOOD SIZE 
IT IS WITH GREAT HEADROOM FOR A CELLAR 
A CELLAR FANTASTIC 
STICK YOUR WINE POOL TABLE 
WOW LOOK AT THE CEILING AMAZING 
SO WHAT'S THE AGE OF THE HOUSE 
IT WAS BUILT IN THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTIES 
GOODNESS ME SO IT REALLY IS PROPER PERIOD PROPERTY 
VERY YEAH AND THIS IS AMAZING 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS ORIGINALLY AN INGLENOOK FIREPLACE WAS IT 
THAT'S RIGHT IT WAS AN INGLENOOK FIREPLACE RIGHT 
ONE THING I'M NOTICING INSTANTLY IS THERE'S NO FURNITURE HERE HAVE YOU MOVED OUT ALREADY 
YEAH I MOVED OUT IN NOVEMBER 
SO WHAT DID YOU USE THIS ROOM FOR 
THIS WAS THE DINING ROOM LOOKS QUITE BIG FOR A DINING ROOM ACTUALLY THAT SHOULD BE GOOD YEAH 
THEN THROUGH TO THE CONSERVATORY WHEN WAS THAT PUT ON WE PUT THAT ON FIVE YEARS AGO 
SO WHICH WAY ARE WE FACING SOUTH FACING 
SO IF IT'S A NICE SUNNY EVENING THAT'S A REALLY GOOD PLACE TO SIT YEAH IT WAS LOVELY 
JUST WHAT WE WANT A SOUTH FACING GARDEN SUNSHINE SIT AND HAVE YOUR BREAKFAST EXCELLENT 
O. K. THEN THERE'S A FURTHER ROOM THROUGH HERE YEAH 
MORE BEAMS 
SO WHAT DID YOU USE THIS ROOM FOR 
CHILDREN'S MUSIC ROOM REALLY LOOKS LOVELY AND LIGHT COS YOU'VE GOT WINDOWS ON BOTH SIDES 
IT'D BE EXCELLENT FOR A STUDY COS YOU WOULDN'T BE OUT THE WAY THEN WOULD YOU 
I MIGHT HAVE TO LEARN TO PLAY THE PIANO THOUGH 
RIGHT SO BACK ACROSS THE MAIN HALLWAY 
THERE'S SOME SERIOUS HUNKS OF WOOD IN THIS PROPERTY AREN'T THERE 
THERE ARE THAT'S AMAZING 
SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT THROUGH HERE ABI THIS IS THE LOUNGE 
O. K. GOSH IT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZE IT IS IT'S LOVELY 
THAT'S A MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE SIZE FOR A LOUNGE 
AND MARK AND VANESSA ACTUALLY HAVE TWO PRETTY CHUNKY SOFAS WHICH I GUESS YOU COULD FIT HERE AND HERE 
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT PATIO DOORS OUT TO THE GARDEN THAT'S RIGHT YES 
NOT SURE ABOUT THE CHANDELIER 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE FIREPLACE BUT WE COULD CHANGE IT IT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
MY GOODNESS IT GOES ON AND ON THIS PROPERTY DOESN'T IT 
WE'RE TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE NOW 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE THAT'S THE DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM GOSH VERY FUNKY DID YOU DO THAT 
YEAH WE DID 
LOOKS BIG FOR A DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 
AND WHAT'S THROUGH THAT DOOR THERE ABI THAT'S THE UTILITY AND THROUGH THERE THE BACK GARDEN BRILLIANT 
THAT'S A BIT OF A TINY BACK GARDEN ISN'T IT 
I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT'S WALLED IN YOU COULD LET DREW OUT AND SHE WOULDN'T ESCAPE ON TO THE ROAD 
O. K. THROUGH TO THE KITCHEN WHICH LOOKS NEW WHEN WAS THIS PUT IN ABI WE PUT THIS IN FIVE YEARS AGO 
AND YOU'VE GONE FOR A VERY MODERN KITCHEN WHICH I THINK VANESSA AND MARK WILL REALLY LIKE 
IT HAS THE LOOK THEY'RE GOING FOR 
THEY WILL ALSO LOVE THIS AREA BECAUSE THEY REALLY WANT TO HAVE SPACE TO HAVE A DINING TABLE 
IN THE KITCHEN SO THEY CAN HAVE BREAKFASTS AND SUPPERS IN HERE 
NICE MODERN KITCHEN NICE MODERN KITCHEN 
IT'S GOT A TABLE AND A CHAIR JUST WHAT WE WANTED FOR DREW 
I'M COMING OUT OF THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
TO THE SIDE IN FRONT OF THE CONSERVATORY WE'VE GOT THE GARAGE 
BUT THE MAIN BODY OF THE GARDEN IS HERE TO THE FRONT OF THE PROPERTY 
BIG LAWNED AREA 
I RECKON THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE HERE TO GET A SIZEABLE VEGETABLE PATCH 
SO LONG AS THE NEIGHBOURS DON'T MIND BECAUSE WE ARE OVERLOOKED 
AT THE BACK BY A PROPERTY THERE AND BY THE REST OF THE HOUSE HERE WHICH IS ATTACHED 
SLIGHTLY OVERLOOKED 
COS OUR GARDEN'S NOT OVERLOOKED AT ALL IS IT 
NO IT'S NOT ATTACHED HOUSE BIT MAYBE THAT'S CONCERNING ME AT THE MOMENT 
THIS PROPERTY FEELS LIKE IT HAS A REAL WARREN OF ROOMS DOWNSTAIRS AND SO IT IS UPSTAIRS 
FIRST OF ALL WE'VE GOT THIS SEPARATE WING HERE WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE LARGELY DEVOTED TO BATHROOM SPACE 
THIS IS THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
THAT IS A MASSIVE BATHROOM WOW 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT HAVING CARPET ON YOUR BATHROOM FLOOR TEND TO GET WET 
BACK ROUND THE CORRIDOR FROM THE BATHROOM THROUGH THIS ARCHWAY 
LEADS INTO WHERE THE BEDROOMS ARE SITUATED 
THERE ARE FOUR IN TOTAL THEY'RE IN A ROW ALONG THIS CORRIDOR HERE 
SO BEDROOM NUMBER ONE IS AT THE FAR END OF THE HOUSE 
IT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZE IT'S GOT FAIRLY LOW CEILINGS 
GOT SOME INTERESTING FEATURES WE'VE GOT THIS BEAM 
WHICH I GUESS IS AN ORIGINAL WHICH SORT OF DISAPPEARS OFF INTO THESE MORE RECENTLY FITTED WARDROBES 
NOT SURE ABOUT THAT BUILDING YOUR WARDROBES AROUND A BEAM 
IT'S VERY INTERESTING IT'S VERY INTERESTING 
SO BACK DOWN THE CORRIDOR 
THIS IS BEDROOM TWO VERY PINK 
BIT OF DIY FOR YOU THERE HONEY SSH 
ALL THE BEDROOMS ARE ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
SO THEY'VE ALL GOT SOUTH FACING WINDOWS SO LOTS OF LIGHT 
AND UP THE STAIRS HERE TO THE MASTER BEDROOM 
NICE OLD DOOR THERE SO THIS IS A REALLY GOOD SIZED ROOM 
I HAVE TO SAY IT'S GOT SO MANY FITTED CUPBOARDS AND VANITY UNITS 
THAT IT'S QUITE HARD TO WORK OUT WHERE YOU'D PUT THE BED 
BUT I GUESS IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE HERE COS THIS IS THE ONLY WALL SPACE THAT'S LEFT 
I DON'T REALLY LIKE THOSE CUPBOARDS 
I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THE MOULDING ON THEM 
THEY LOOK A BIT ER I DON'T KNOW TACKY REALLY 
AND IT HAS ALSO GOT THE ESSENTIAL EN SUITE BATHROOM 
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT MY FAMILY MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH ALL THE DECORATING DECISIONS 
THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN THIS HOUSE AND IT IS AT THE VERY TOP END OF THEIR BUDGET 
I GUESS THEY COULD CHANGE THINGS GRADUALLY OVER THE YEARS 
AND IN THE MEANTIME THEY CAN GET BUSY OUT IN THE GARDEN WITH THE VEGETABLE PATCH 
HILL TOP HOUSE IS ON THE MARKET 
FOR JUST BELOW THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
AND THE CELLAR AND GARDEN ARE A REAL BONUS 
BUT WHILST THE PROPERTY DOES HAVE BAGS OF PERIOD CHARM 
IT WILL TAKE SOME WORK TO MAKE IT ENERGY EFFICIENT 
FOR MY NEXT PROPERTY I'VE TRAVELLED TWO MILES NORTH ALONG THE LINCOLN CLIFF 
TO THE VILLAGE OF BRACEBRIDGE HEATH 
FOR CENTURIES THIS VILLAGE EXISTED 
AS A STOP OFF AT THE JUNCTION OF TWO MAIN ROMAN ROADS 
NOW MODERN A ROADS BY THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
THE PLACE WAS BOOMING ON THE BACK OF THE AIR INDUSTRY 
THE PROPERTY I'M OFF TO SEE LIES ONLY TWO HUNDRED METRES AWAY FROM THE HEATH ALONGSIDE THE OLD ROMAN ROADS 
SEVENTY FIVE LONDON ROAD IS A FOUR BEDROOM DETACHED HOUSE 
I LIKE THE GRAVEL GARDEN 
NICE BAY KIND OF LIKE WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW THOUGH 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
WELL BELOW MARK AND VANESSA'S TOP BUDGET 
THE HOMEOWNER ROB WILLETT IS GOING TO SHOW ME AROUND 
SO THAT'S YOUR FRONT DOOR THAT I'VE COME IN THROUGH INTO YOUR CENTRAL HALLWAY HERE 
SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT THERE A DOWNSTAIRS LOO WASH BASIN AND A SHOWER 
IT'S GOT A SHOWER UNIT EXTREMELY USEFUL FOR A FAMILY THAT'S GOOD HAVING A DOWNSTAIRS SHOWER 
I'M GOING TO HAVE A LOOK AT UPSTAIRS LATER BUT LET'S START IN HERE 
NOW I'M LOOKING AT THESE VERY LOVELY DOORS NINETEEN THIRTIES STYLE 
YES THE HOUSE WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN THIRTY AND STARTED LIFE AS THE RECTORY OF BRACEBRIDGE HEATH 
I THINK THAT LOOKS LIKE QUITE A GOOD SIZE FOR A LIVING ROOM 
CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE TO FIT OUR SOFAS IN 
SO WE'RE FACING THE FRONT HERE SO THE REST OF THE HOUSE GOES BACKWARDS INDEED 
SHALL WE CARRY ON DOWN THE HALL AND HAVE A LOOK YES 
GOODNESS THIS REALLY IS THE HOUSE OF DOORS ISN'T IT INDEED IT IS 
THIS THE STUDY ALL IMPORTANT ROOM FOR MARK 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS LIKE A DINING ROOM BUT IT LOOKS PRETTY SIZEABLE FOR A STUDY 
GOOD SPACE YOU'VE GOT A DESK A PIANO AND SOFA AND BOOKSHELVES WHICH IS GREAT I IMAGINE 
IT'S FAIRLY QUIET IS IT IT IS BEING ON THE SIDE THIS IS PERFECT 
REALLY GOOD SO SHALL WE CARRY ON LOOK AT WHAT'S NEXT 
AHA SEPARATE DINING ROOM THIS IS ANOTHER OF THE THINGS ON MY LIST 
THOSE THREE DOORS MEAN THAT MAKES IT QUITE A BIG SPACE SO YOU COULD USE IT WHEN YOU'D GOT PEOPLE ROUND 
YOU COULD EITHER SHUT THE DOORS OR LEAVE THEM OPEN AS THEY'VE DONE 
HAVE YOU USED THIS MUCH VERY MUCH SO 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY SOCIAL AREA AND WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE AS FULL USE OF IT AS WE POSSIBLY COULD 
THAT IS A GOOD SIZED SPACE PLENTY OF SPACE FOR A GOOD TABLE 
AND THEN FLOWS THROUGH INTO THE KITCHEN HERE 
ANOTHER GREAT THING IS THAT YOU'VE SPACE FOR A TABLE IN YOUR KITCHEN 
IT'S A GOOD FAMILY HOUSE AND A GOOD FAMILY KITCHEN WHICH IS GREAT 
YEAH I'D WANT TO DO SOMETHING WITH THOSE UNITS AND THINGS COS IT LOOKS A BIT 
IT'S A BIT DATED ISN'T IT IT IS A LITTLE BIT DATED 
AND THEN FLOWS ON THROUGH SO WHAT'S IN THAT SECTION AT THE BACK 
TO THE LEFT IS OUR UTILITY ROOM WHERE YOU'VE GOT YOUR WASHING MACHINE ETC 
PLENTY OF SPACE FOR THE WASHER TUMBLER YEP 
SO OUT OF THE BACK DOOR THE FIRST THING YOU COME TO IS THE DOUBLE GARAGE SO ALREADY A BIG BONUS 
ANOTHER BONUS IS THAT ROB HAD THIS BUILT EXTRA BIG 
SO ALL THAT HOARDING THAT YOU LIKE DOING YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIT ALL THOSE BOXES UP THERE YEAH THANKS 
SO THESE ARE THE GARDENS THEY'RE MOSTLY LAID TO THE SIDE AND THE BACK OF THE PROPERTY 
WHICH IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE THE HOUSE FRONTS ON TO THE A FIFTEEN 
MARK AND VANESSA WILL KNOW THAT THAT'S A FAIRLY BUSY ROAD 
OUR GARDEN'S AT THE BACK IT IS 
YOU CAN GO IN THE GARDEN AND ESCAPE FROM THE NOISE WHEREAS THAT'S AT THE SIDE 
IT'S A NICE SIZE I DON'T KNOW IF THE FUMES WOULD AFFECT YOUR VEGETABLES 
IF YOU VIEW THIS HOUSE FRONT ON FROM OUTSIDE 
IT ACTUALLY LOOKS QUITE SMALL BUT INSIDE THERE'S AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF SPACE COS IT ALL GOES BACK 
IT HAS STILL GOT THAT LOVELY NINETEEN THIRTIES STYLE TO IT WHICH I RATHER LIKE 
THERE ARE FOUR BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS THIS IS THE FIRST 
AND THE SMALLEST AT THE FRONT 
THAT IS A SMALL BEDROOM 
THAT'S I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT'S SMALLER THAN OUR SMALL ROOM 
NEXT DOOR IS BEDROOM NUMBER TWO 
IT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZED DOUBLE 
WE ARE AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE HERE 
BUT THE SECONDARY GLAZING CUTS OUT SOME ROAD NOISE 
AGAIN LOOKS LIKE THERE'S GONNA BE KIND OF A LOT OF WORK TO DO 
NEXT DOOR YOU'VE GOT BEDROOM NUMBER THREE WHICH AGAIN IS A GOOD SIZED DOUBLE 
I'M AMAZED BY THE SPACIOUSNESS OF THESE BEDROOMS 
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TOWARDS THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
IN THE CENTRE OF THE CORRIDOR YOU'VE GOT THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
THIS IS THE ONLY BATHROOM AT THE MOMENT APART FROM THAT LITTLE SHOWER ROOM DOWNSTAIRS 
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S A FULL SIZED BATH IT LOOKS A SMALL BATHROOM 
SO ON DOWN THE CORRIDOR 
THAT'S THE AIRING CUPBOARD AND AT THE VERY FAR END IS THE LOO IN HERE IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
IT'S GOT GOOD BIG WINDOWS SO IT'S NICE AND LIGHT IN HERE AND WE'RE ON THE SIDE OF THE PROPERTY 
IT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZED ROOM BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT EN SUITE BATHROOM THAT VANESSA SO WANTS 
ROB TELLS ME THAT HE HAS CONSIDERED KNOCKING THROUGH 
THIS RATHER JAUNTILY DECORATED LITTLE FITTED CUPBOARD 
ON THE FAR SIDE OF IT IS THE EXISTING LOO SO YOU COULD WITH 
A BIT OF IMAGINATION INCORPORATE AN EN SUITE BATHROOM INTO THE PLANS 
I DON'T MIND GETTING MY HANDS DIRTY BUT TO BE HONEST 
I'D RATHER SPEND THE TIME INSTALLING THE ENERGY EFFICIENT STUFF 
LONDON ROAD IS A GOOD SIZED FAMILY HOME 
WITH A GARDEN RIPE FOR ALL OF MARK'S ECO PLANS 
BUT THE PROPERTY WOULD NEED A BIT OF UPDATING 
AND THE ROAD MAY PUT THEM OFF 
STILL TO COME ON ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRY 
MARK AND VANESSA FIND PLENTY TO AGREE ON WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR PLANS 
FOR INTERIOR DECOR 
WE'D HAVE TO RIP IT OUT AND START AGAIN YEAH THAT'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN HERE AS WELL 
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BOYS AND THEIR TOYS THERE'S NO NEGOTIATION 
BIG T. V. SCREEN LEATHER SOFA 
FANTASTIC ALL ME GAMES CONSOLES 
IT'LL BE EXCELLENT NO NO NO NO NO NO 
I START THE SECOND DAY OF MY SEARCH WITH SOME GOOD NEWS FOR MARK AND VANESSA 
MY INVESTIGATIONS HAVE TURNED UP A LOCAL ECO HOUSE 
IT'S IN REEPHAM FOUR MILES FROM LINCOLN 
THIS SMALL PRETTY VILLAGE IS A SOUGHT AFTER PLACE TO BUY 
NOT LEAST FOR ITS TOP LOCAL SCHOOLS AND STUNNING COUNTRYSIDE 
NUMBER SEVEN REEPHAM BECK IS A BRAND NEW FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE 
WITH ECO FRIENDLY FEATURES A GO GO 
INCLUDING SOLAR PANELLING TO HEAT THE HOT WATER SUPPLY 
THE HOUSE IS ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND 
ECO FRIENDLY HOUSE 
INTERESTED IN THE ECO THING 
BUT I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THE LOOK OF THE HOUSE FROM THE OUTSIDE 
THE QUESTION IS ARE MARK AND VANESSA REALLY WILLING TO COMPROMISE 
A LITTLE ON THEIR WISH LIST IN ORDER TO GET THEIR ECO HOUSE 
RIGHT CHRIS HERE WE ARE 
I'VE BEEN VERY INTRIGUED ON THE WAY OVER TO SEE WHAT A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ECO HOME WOULD LOOK LIKE 
YOU COULD EXPECT STARSHIP ENTERPRISE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL HOUSE 
YEAH IT'S DESIGNED WITH THE MAINSTREAM MARKET IN MIND 
BUT IT'S GOT ALL THESE 
ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES IN BUILT AS WELL I CAN'T WAIT TO THESE LET'S GET INSIDE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS EXPECTING FROM AN ECO HOUSE M. M. M. 
IT'S A BIT OF A SURPRISING DESIGN SEE WHAT FEATURES IT'S GOT 
IN WE COME NICE WIDE HALLWAY 
THAT'S A GOOD START WHAT HAVE WE GOT IN HERE CRAIG 
THAT'S THE DOWNSTAIRS TOILET IN THERE AND WHAT'S IN HERE 
JUST SPARE STORAGE SPACE IN THERE BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT INTELLIGENT HEATING CONTROL AS WELL 
IT BASICALLY REACTS AND LEARNS AND ADAPTS TO THE HOUSE AND CHANGES TO THE CLIMATE AS WELL 
IT ADJUSTS WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO RE PROGRAMME IT 
THAT'S RIGHT IT JUST MAKES IT EASY FOR THE CONSUMER 
SO THE INTELLIGENT THING IS YOU CLOSE THE DOOR AND IT GETS ON WITH IT YES FANTASTIC 
SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GOOD IDEA JUST TO MINIMISE YOUR COSTS 
IT DOES MINIMISE YOUR ENERGY USAGE 
SO LET'S GO THROUGH HERE FIRST 
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE SITTING ROOM IS IT YEAH 
THAT'S A NICE SIZE THAT 
IT IS PLENTY OF SPACE TO GET OUR SOFAS IN 
THERE'S DOUBLE THE LEVEL OF INSULATION IN THE THICKNESS OF THIS WALL 
THAT'S GONNA MAKE IT MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT YES 
I'VE GOT UNDERFLOOR HEATING THROUGHOUT THIS GROUND FLOOR AND THE BASEMENT 
DOUBLE INSULATION MEANS YOU'RE ALREADY STARTING TO SAVE ENERGY STRAIGHTAWAY WHICH IS GOOD 
IT'S OVER FOUR FLOORS I NOTICED ON THE DETAILS 
ADDITIONAL BASEMENT AS WELL SO THAT'S THE BASEMENT DOWN THERE 
SHALL WE DO THAT NEXT 
ANOTHER DOOR WHAT HAVE WE GOT IN HERE CRAIG 
UTILITY ROOM DOWN IN THERE OH BRILLIANT 
UTILITY ROOM DOWNSTAIRS WOULD I BE UP AND DOWN STAIRS 
CARRYING YOUR WASHING 
I'D BE DEFINITELY FIT WOULDN'T I BIG ROOM THROUGH HERE 
IT'S A HUGE ROOM THIS ONE IT'S A HUGE SPACE 
OBVIOUSLY IT IS ON THE BASEMENT LEVEL BUT IT HAS GOT LIGHT FROM THIS IS RATHER FUNKY ISN'T IT 
THIS IS A LIGHT PIPE YOU JUST GET A BIT OF NATURAL LIGHT 
MARK IS AFTER A STUDY SO I GUESS HE COULD USE THIS IT'S HUGE ISN'T IT 
THAT WOULD BE A MASSIVE STUDY 
I'D HAVE TO USE IT AS A LIBRARY AS WELL 
I'D BE LOST IN THE CORNER WOULDN'T I THAT IS BIG 
I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THIS EXTRAORDINARY THING IS IT PART OF THE BOILER SYSTEM 
NO THIS IS ACTUALLY A VACUUM SYSTEM 
THERE'S LOADS OF PIPES IN THE HOUSE AND VARIOUS POINTS 
WHERE YOU JUST PLUG IN YOUR VACUUM HOSE AND HOOVER AWAY 
I'M NOT SURE THIS IS AS ECO FRIENDLY AS I'D LIKE IT TO BE 
I KNOW IT'S A GREAT MODERN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THING BUT HMM 
BACK UP FROM THE BASEMENT SO ON THE GROUND FLOOR AGAIN NOW 
CENTRAL HALLWAY SO THERE'S THE LIVING ROOM THIS MUST BE THE KITCHEN 
THAT'S RIGHT YOUR DINING ROOM'S THROUGH THERE WITH IT AS WELL RIGHT O. K. ONE BIG ROOM 
THAT'S QUITE BRIGHT 
IT'S NICE AND BIG KITCHEN LOOKS NICE AND MODERN 
SO FIRST THINGS FIRST IF I WANTED TO DO A BIT OF VACUUMING WHERE DO I PLUG THE HOSE IN 
YOUR POINT'S JUST UNDER HERE JUST DO IT FROM THIS ONE POINT THIS ONE POINT BRILLIANT 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LONG HOSE THEN COS THAT'S A BIG ROOM 
SO I GUESS THEY HAVE STILL GOT A SEPARATE EATING AREA 
IN THE KITCHEN FOR BREAKFASTS AND SUPPERS 
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH AND THEN THIS MORE FORMAL AREA OVER HERE 
YOU COULD CERTAINLY FIT A BIG ENOUGH TABLE IN TO GET EVERYBODY ROUND 
FOR FAMILY GATHERINGS AND THEN THIS LEADS OUT TO THE GARDEN DOES IT 
LOVELY VIEW OF THE GARDEN NO SCOPE FOR GROWING VEGETABLES I DON'T THINK 
NO WAY THAT IS 
A RIDICULOUSLY SMALL GARDEN YOU'VE GOT NO GRASS 
SO ON THE FIRST FLOOR WE'VE GOT THREE BEDROOMS 
THE FIRST TWO ARE HERE AT THE FRONT OF THE PROPERTY 
THEY LOOK QUITE SMALL DON'T THEY THE BEDROOMS 
THEY DON'T LOOK A BAD SIZE TO BE HONEST 
IN THE MIDDLE HERE WE'VE GOT THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
EVERYWHERE YOU GO THERE'S SOME ECO FRIENDLY THINGS BEING POPPED IN 
YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER LIGHT PIPE DROPPING NATURAL LIGHT INTO THE ROOM 
THEN FINALLY ON THIS FLOOR AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE THIS IS BEDROOM THREE 
SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT MAYBE THIS WAS A REALLY LOVELY ROOM FOR DREW 
THEN SHE COULD USE THAT OFFSHOOT ROOM AS A PLAY ROOM OR A TOY STORE 
THAT'S A BIG ROOM FOR DREW TO HAVE 
IT IS A BIG ROOM DREW GETS THE BIGGEST ROOM ON OUR FLOOR 
BUT I WOULDN'T WANT DREW ON A SEPERATE FLOOR TO US NO 
SO COMING UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR NOW THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
WORTH POINTING OUT THAT UP HERE RIGHT UP IN THE ROOF IS WHERE YOU'VE GOT THE INSULATION 
IT'S RECYCLED PAPER INSULATION AND APPARENTLY IT'S FIFTY PER CENT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN NORMAL INSULATING MATERIALS 
THAT'S GOOD I LIKE THE FACT THAT THEY'RE 
MAKING USE OF RECYCLED PAPER AND IT'S BETTER 
IF THEY'RE THINKING THIS ROOM IS ONLY GOING TO TAKE OUR BED WHERE ARE WE GOING TO PUT OUR CLOTHES 
NOT TO WORRY BECAUSE THERE'S AN EXTRA LITTLE ROOM HERE 
OFF THE BEDROOM WHICH YOU CAN ONLY REALLY USE AS A WALK IN WARDROBE SO IT'S REALLY GOOD EXTRA STORAGE 
THEN NEXT DOOR IS THE EN SUITE BATHROOM 
SO IT HAS GOT AN EN SUITE 
IT HASN'T GOT A BATH IT'S GOT A VERY FUNKY SHOWER 
I'M JUST A BIT CONCERNED THAT THERE'S NO 
WINDOWS IN ANY OF THE BATHROOMS 
YES IT'S LIKE THE FRESH AIR ISN'T OPENING THE WINDOWS 
LETTING THE FRESH AIR IN AND LETTING THE MOISTURE OUT 
THIS MODERN ECO FRIENDLY HOUSE HAS BEEN A REAL VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY FOR ME 
WITH SOME GOOD ENERGY SAVING AND MONEY SAVING FEATURES 
IT COULD BE A GREAT START TO MARK AND VANESSA'S NEW LIFESTYLE 
HOWEVER THE HOUSE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE THE OUTSIDE SPACE MARK 
WAS AFTER SO WILL THE ECO FEATURES BE ENOUGH TO SWAY THEM 
FOR MY FINAL PROPERTY I'VE TRAVELLED TWENTY MILES TO LEE VILLAGE 
NEAR THE LINCOLNSHIRE AND NOTTINGHAMSHIRE BORDER 
THE DETAILS OF THIS MODERN GEORGIAN STYLE PROPERTY SOUNDED GREAT 
A LARGE FAMILY HOME WITH DOUBLE GARAGE ON THE MARKET AT TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
BUT THERE'S NO ESCAPING ONE BLOT ON THE LANDSCAPE 
A HARMLESS BUT UGLY POWER STATION ON THE HORIZON 
THAT IS 
A NASTY VIEW ISN'T IT 
M. M. M. DOES THAT MEAN YOU GET ALL THE SMOKE OVER THE HOUSE AS WELL 
JOY BLOOD HAS LIVED IN THE PROPERTY FOR FOUR YEARS NICE TO SEE YOU 
SO HERE WE ARE NICE CENTRAL HALLWAY 
I GUESS EVERYTHING LIES OFF IN ALL DIRECTIONS SO SHALL WE GO IN THIS DIRECTION FIRST 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT THROUGH HERE THIS IS OUR STUDY 
THAT'S NOT BAD AS A STUDY NO NICE SIZE YOU CAN FIT A DESK 
THERE'S A SOFA T. V. RIGHT 
SO THIS IS YOUR SITTING ROOM 
YES RATHER GRAND FEEL WITH THE DOORS THERE 
AND I'M NOTICING IMMEDIATELY YOU'VE GOT THE CEILING ROSE AND THE CORNICING 
ARE THEY MOCK PERIOD DETAILS THEY'RE TRYING TO BE KEPT IN THE TRADITION THAT THE HOUSE STYLE IS 
THEY WILL LOVE THE PATIO DOORS THE FACT THAT YOU CAN OPEN OUT 
IT'S LOVELY ON A SUMMER'S EVENING YES HAVE THOSE OPEN VERY NICE 
I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING THE PATIO LEADING OUT ONTO THE GARDEN 
IT'S IDEAL WITH DREW IN AND OUT IN SUMMER THAT'D BE REALLY GOOD 
GOODNESS I SEE IT ALL LOOKS VERY SPARKLY AND NEW WHEN DID YOU PUT THIS IN JOY 
ABOUT FIFTEEN MONTHS AGO 
SO YOU'VE CREATED LOADS MORE WORK SPACE YOU'VE RECONFIGURED THE WHOLE THING 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU'VE LEFT SPACE FOR THE TABLE 
I JUST SEE WILLOW AND DREW RUNNING ROUND AND ROUND THERE WHILE YOU'RE COOKING IN THE MIDDLE 
LET'S GO THROUGH HERE 
SO THIS IS YOUR DINING ROOM 
VERY IMPORTANT ROOM FOR MY FAMILY 
YOUR TABLE LOOKS LIKE IT'S AT LEAST AN EIGHT SEATER 
IT IS DEFINITELY I'VE HAD TEN ROUND IT SO YES 
PLENTY OF SPACE YEAH EXCELLENT FOR ENTERTAINING 
YEAH SO WE COULD FIT TEN PEOPLE ROUND 
PERFECT FOR FAMILY CHRISTMASES 
SO UPSTAIRS WE'VE GOT FOUR BEDROOMS 
THE FIRST OF WHICH IS AT THE FRONT OF THE PROPERTY 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE DOUBLE THAT'S QUITE A BIG ROOM IT'S A NICE SIZE ISN'T IT 
SO NEXT UP DOWN THE CORRIDOR IS THE MASTER BEDROOM IT ISN'T A BAD SIZE 
I THINK IT PROBABLY WOULD TAKE MARK AND VANESSA'S KING SIZE BED 
THAT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK AS BIG AS THE PREVIOUS BEDROOM THAT'S THE MASTER 
AND IT HAS GOT AN EN SUITE BATHROOM 
IT'S NOT HUGE BUT IT'S DEFINITELY GOT EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED 
AND IT'S GOT A WINDOW YES IT HAS 
SO IN THE MIDDLE HERE IS THE THIRD OF THE BEDROOMS 
THIS IS DEFINITELY THE SMALLEST 
MAYBE A GOOD ROOM FOR LITTLE DREW TO START OUT IN 
AND THEN ON THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE SO BACK AT THE FRONT WE'VE GOT BEDROOM NUMBER FOUR 
THAT'S DEFINITELY A DOUBLE AND THERE'S SPACE FOR STORAGE IN THERE 
THIS ALMOST IS THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE 
THIS IS THE FAMILY BATHROOM AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY HUGE AS YOU CAN SEE 
TWO WINDOWS AND PLENTY OF SPACE FOR THE BATH A SHOWER CUBICLE 
YOU COULD ALMOST GET ANOTHER SHOWER CUBICLE IN THIS CORNER SO THEY COULD HAVE DUAL FAMILY SHOWERING 
NICE SIZE SO POPPING OUT OF THE KITCHEN 
WHICH LEADS OUT ONTO THIS PATIO AREA WHICH IS PART OF THE WORK THAT JOY'S DONE OUT HERE IN THE GARDEN 
IT'S ALSO WORTH POINTING OUT THAT A THE GARDEN IS SOUTH WEST FACING SO THAT'S REALLY LOVELY FOR GETTING 
THE SUNLIGHT IT ALSO MEANS THAT YOU COULD SITE SOME SOLAR PANELS ON THE ROOF THERE 
EVEN SPACE FOR SOME SOLAR WATER HEATING PANELS AS WELL GREAT 
I'D SAY THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE OUT HERE 
JOY HAD ALREADY THOUGHT OF PUTTING A VEGETABLE PATCH AND SHE'S ALREADY DONE A BIT OF DIGGING 
AND PUT IN SOME COMPOSTING BINS WHICH I KNOW MARK AND VANESSA WILL REALLY APPROVE OF 
IT'S JUST WHAT WE NEED ISN'T IT NICE BIG GARDEN 
HAVING SEEN ALL FOUR PROPERTIES IT'S TIME FOR MARK AND VANESSA 
TO DECIDE ON WHICH TWO THEY WANT TO CHECK OUT FOR THEMSELVES 
HILL TOP HOUSE IS A FOUR BEDROOM TWO BATHROOM PERIOD PROPERTY 
AND DEFINITELY HAS THE SPACE TO BE THE FAMILY HOME THEY'RE AFTER 
THE OUTSIDE SPACE IS GOOD TOO BUT AFTER MARK'S INSULATION LESSON 
WILL THE HOUSE SEEM TOO MUCH OF A PROJECT TO GET UP TO SCRATCH 
AND IT'S PRICEY AT JUST FIVE UNDER THEIR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUDGET 
THE NINETEEN THIRTIES HOUSE ON LONDON ROAD IS DECEPTIVE IN SIZE 
AND IS WELL BELOW BUDGET AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
IT HAS AMPLE SPACE FOR MARK AND VANESSA TO MAKE THEIR OWN 
BUT WITH A SLIGHTLY DATED INTERIOR IT WOULD BE A FAIR UNDERTAKING 
THE ECO HOUSE IN REEPHAM BECK 
HAS A WHOLE LOAD OF ENERGY SAVING FEATURES 
SOLAR PANELS HIGH LEVEL INSULATION AND UNDERFLOOR HEATING 
BUT TO GET GIZMOS THERE'S A PRICE TO PAY AND IN THIS CASE IT'S SACRIFICING A LARGE GARDEN 
THE HOUSE IS ON AT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND 
PASTURE HOUSE IS A MODERN FAMILY HOME 
WITH ALL THE SPACE MARK AND VANESSA ARE AFTER INSIDE AND OUT 
BUT THERE'S NO DENYING THE NEARBY POWER STATION SPOILS THE VIEW 
AT TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND I BELIEVE THIS IS WHY SUCH A GREAT HOUSE 
IS AFFORDABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
SO THE QUESTION IS IS THE HOUSE WORTH THE COMPROMISE 
IF NONE OF THESE PROPERTIES IS UP MARK AND VANESSA'S STREET 
THEY CAN ALWAYS CHOOSE TO SEE MY MYSTERY HOUSE 
IT'S A FOUR BEDROOM CHARACTER COTTAGE WITH GOOD SIZED FRONT 
AND BACK GARDENS AND EVEN SOME OUTBUILDINGS ALL FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
BUT BEING TEN MILES SOUTH WEST OF NEWARK IT'S JUST OUTSIDE THEIR SEARCH AREA 
THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING 
O. K. WHAT ABOUT HILL TOP HOUSE IN WADDINGTON 
I LIKED IT IT'S WORTH INVESTIGATING 
WE'LL PUT THAT ON THE YES PILE DEFINITELY LIKE THAT ONE 
NINETEEN THIRTIES HOUSE NO DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL 
TOO MUCH TO DO DEFINITELY NO REEPHAM HOUSE 
THERE WERE THINGS I REALLY LIKED ABOUT THIS HOUSE BUT I THINK THEY 
SEEMED TO HAVE COPPED OUT OF GOING THE WHOLE HOG SO I'LL PUT THIS ON THE MAYBE AND COME BACK IN A SECOND 
PASTURE HOUSE IN LEE 
DEFINITELY LIKE THE HOUSE LOVE THE GARDEN BUT POWER STATION 
NO SO DEFINITELY NO FOR THAT ONE 
ECO HOUSE OR MYSTERY HOUSE 
YEAH THERE WAS NO GARDEN 
O. K. SO IT'S DEFINITELY NO FOR THE ECO HOUSE THEN 
WE'LL GO FOR THE MYSTERY HOUSE AND HILL TOP HOUSE AT WADDINGTON YES DEFINITELY 
SO TWO OLDER PROPERTIES HAVE WON THE DAY 
I GO TO MEET MARK AND VANESSA AT THE MYSTERY HOUSE IN HOUGH ON THE HILL 
WITH NO SHOPS AND JUST A PUB HERE THIS IS A VERY PEACEFUL LOCATION 
DEFINITELY NO A ROADS OR POWER STATIONS HERE 
AND JUST A MILE DOWN THE ROAD IS A LARGER VILLAGE WITH MORE AMENITIES 
THIS MODERNISED PERIOD COTTAGE IS ON THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE AND IS IN TIP TOP CONDITION 
ANY LEFTOVER MONEY COULD GO ON INSTALLING ALL THOSE ENERGY SAVING 
GADGETS AND BEING FIFTY GRAND UNDER BUDGET THERE'S A FAIR BIT OF CASH TO PLAY WITH 
RIGHT HERE WE ARE WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS FROM THE OUTSIDE 
LOOKS VERY NICE NOT DETACHED OBVIOUSLY BUT IT LOOKS NICE CLEAN 
ONLY A SINGLE GARAGE BUT IT DOES LOOK A VERY NICE HOUSE 
AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S GOT A GOOD DEEP FRONT GARDEN 
IT'S WELL OFF THE ROAD SO PERFECT FOR DREW LET'S GET INSIDE AND HAVE A PROPER LOOK AROUND FOLLOW ME 
RIGHT COME IN COME IN NICE TILES ON THE FLOOR 
IT'S A PERIOD HOUSE BUT I THINK YOU'LL SEE AS WE GO AROUND IT'S BEEN 
IT'S BEEN SORT OF RENOVATED SO IT FEELS VERY SOLID 
THAT'S THE SITTING ROOM 
LIKE THE BEAMS IT'S NICE 
NICE AND PALE BRIGHT I'M NOT SURE WE COULD FIT BOTH OUR SOFAS IN HERE 
THEY'VE GOT A GOOD SIZED SOFA THERE AND YOU COULD PUT SOMETHING 
ALONG THE WHOLE OF THAT WALL I LIKE THE FIRE 
CEILINGS ARE A BIT LOWER THAN I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE BUT THEY'RE NOT TOO LOW 
CRIKEY THAT'S NOT LOW 
YOU COULD GET A GIANT IN HERE 
I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD SPACIOUS ROOM YOU HAVE GOT THE PATIO DOORS OUT TO THE GARDEN THERE 
WE'LL COME BACK TO LOOK AT THE GARDEN WHEN WE'VE SEEN THE REST OF THE LIVING ACCOMMODATION 
I LIKE THE DOORS THIS IS THE KITCHEN 
THAT'S QUITE INTERESTING YES ISN'T THIS AMAZING 
THIS IS THE ORIGINAL STOVE AND THE CURRENT OWNER TELLS ME 
YOU CAN LIGHT IT STILL AND IT'S ALL GOT A BIT PAINTED UP NOW BUT YOU CAN PUT THE WATER IN THERE AND IT 
HEATS IN THE TOP OF THERE AND THERE'S THE LITTLE TAP ON THE SIDE 
FANTASTIC THAT'S EXCELLENT BUT STOVE ASIDE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE PROPORTIONS OF THE KITCHEN 
IT'S GREAT I LOVE THE FACT YOU CAN GET A TABLE IN LET'S CARRY ON 
THAT'S THE STAIRS THERE YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK UP IN A MINUTE 
JUST STICK YOUR HEADS IN THERE 
DOWNSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM AND IT'S GOT A SHOWER AND A BATH 
THIS IS THE SECOND RECEPTION ROOM SO WE'VE GOT TO THINK 
YOU WANTED A SEPARATE DINING ROOM AND A STUDY SO WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'D GO FOR 
I GET THE IMPRESSION THIS HAS BEEN A SNUG COS OF THE FIRE 
YES IT IS A COSY ROOM 
IT WOULD MAKE A NICE DINING ROOM BECAUSE OF HAVING THE FIREPLACE 
SO FROM WHAT YOU'VE SEEN INSIDE SO FAR VERY IMPRESSED 
OUT YOU COME WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS 
DECEPTIVE FROM THE FRONT I LIKE THE FACT THAT 
THERE ARE TWO BIG BUILDINGS IN THE GARDEN 
YES HENCE WHERE MY STUDY IDEA COMES IN BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU COULD CONVERT THAT LITTLE SHED THERE 
I DON'T MIND THE IDEA OF BEING IN THE GARDEN PEACE AND QUIET 
KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR CHICKENS WHILE YOU'RE WORKING 
AND THERE'S ROOM AS WELL BEHIND THE LITTLE BRICK SHED THERE VEGETABLE PATCH I THOUGHT 
YEAH VEGETABLE PATCH IDEAL 
WHAT ABOUT THE ROOF DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET A SOLAR PANEL ON THAT 
YEAH YOU COULD FIT A SOLAR PANEL ON THERE IT'S GOT A NICE PITCH 
RIGHT O. K. HEAD BACK INSIDE AND HAVE A GOOD EXPLORE UPSTAIRS AND WE'LL SEE YOU LATER 
FANTASTIC THANKS 
DREW WILL PROBABLY LOVE THIS NICE AND GIRLY AND THERE'S SOME REALLY GOOD VIEWS 
I REALLY LIKE THAT NICE VIE W. S. 
THAT'S A GOOD DOUBLE BEDROOM 
YEAH THAT'D BE PERFECT FOR OUR PARENTS TO STAY IN 
PERFECT FOR ANOTHER CHILD 
WHAT SO SOON 
YEAH IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A SHOWER ROOM UPSTAIRS 
OR YOU'D HAVE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO GO TO THE TOILET 
HELLO HAD A GOOD LOOK ROUND 
WE HAVE THANK YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IT WAS VERY DECEPTIVE FROM THE FRONT VERY NICELY DECORATED 
I WAS SURPRISED COS FROM THE FRONT WE THOUGHT IT WAS THREE BEDROOMS 
AND WHEN YOU GET INSIDE YOU FIND OUT THERE'S ACTUALLY FOUR BEDROOMS AND TWO BATHROOMS 
I THINK IT'S GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY 
ANYWAY WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT NEXT SO LET'S HEAD OFF TO PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
SO HERE WE ARE WE'LL PAUSE HERE FOR A MOMENT 
BECAUSE THIS IS THE GARDEN TO THE SIDE OF THE PROPERTY 
I LIKE THAT GARDEN THINK YOU'D GET A FEW VEG IN THERE 
PERHAPS NOT THE SHEEP YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO HEAR 
NOT REALLY OVERLOOKED PARTICULARLY HERE'S THE HOUSE IN FRONT OF US 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT LOOKS VERY NICE 
RIGHT O. K. LET'S GET INSIDE AND HAVE A LOOK AROUND FOLLOW ME 
IN YOU COME 
JUST BEHIND YOU THERE IS THE ACCESS TO THE CELLAR OH RIGHT O. K. 
LET'S GO THROUGH THIS WAY FIRST 
IT'S NICE 
BEAMS IT IS VERY NICE 
THESE BEAMS LOOK GOOD DON'T THEY YEAH 
SO THIS IS THE ROOM I THOUGHT YOU COULD MAYBE USE AS YOUR DINING ROOM 
YES GOOD FOR A DINING ROOM 
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT A LOT MORE ROOMS DOWNSTAIRS THAN IN THE PREVIOUS HOUSE 
WE'VE GOT YOUR SECOND RECEPTION ROOM HERE 
OH YES WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE STUDY FOR THIS YEAH 
THIS IS CERTAINLY BIG ENOUGH OBVIOUSLY THE BIGGER THE BETTER 
O. K. THERE'S LOTS MORE TO SEE SO LET'S CARRY ON FOLLOW ME 
O. K. SO BACK ACROSS THE HALL 
AND INTO THE SITTING ROOM 
THIS SEEMS QUITE BIG WOW THIS IS BIG 
IT'S NICE I REMEMBER THE CHANDELIERS NOW 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THEM MARK WOULD YOU KEEP THEM I THINK I MIGHT GET RID OF THEM 
BUT NOW DON'T BE TRYING TO TELL ME YOU CAN'T GET YOUR SOFAS IN HERE 
NO THIS IS A VERY NICE SIZED LIVING ROOM THIS IS A NICE SIZED LIVING ROOM 
SO DO YOU FEEL SO FAR THAT YOU LIKE IT ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO SEE BEYOND HOW THE CURRENT OWNER HAS DECORATED 
DEFINITELY YEAH YOU HAVE TO DO THAT DON'T YOU JUST TO PUT YOUR MARK ON THINGS YEAH 
SO WHAT WOULD YOUR VISION BE FOR THIS ROOM 
WE'D JUST PROBABLY TURN IT DOWN A BIT MAKE IT A BIT MORE TRADITIONAL 
YEAH I THINK A BIT LESS OSTENTATIOUS RIGHT SO 
BACK ACROSS THE HALLWAY 
STRAIGHT AHEAD VANESSA YOU'VE GOT YOUR UTILITY AREA 
GREAT JUST WHAT I NEEDED 
AND BEHIND ME DOWNSTAIRS LOO 
RIGHT THE KITCHEN MODERN KITCHEN 
I LIKE THE UNITS THESE ARE NICE YEAH 
SO ACTUALLY YOU'RE SAYING OOH LOVELY MODERN KITCHEN 
LIKE THE NEW FLOOR THE CLEAN LINES ACTUALLY YOU'RE TENDING TOWARDS 
THE MODERN EVEN THOUGH WE'RE LOOKING ROUND A VERY OLD PERIOD HOUSE YES 
I LIKE THAT MIX OF 
OLD TRADITIONAL CHARACTER FEATURES AND 
MODERN CONVENIENCE APPLIANCES AND NICE CLEAN LINES TO GO WITH IT 
O. K. GO UPSTAIRS HAVE A LOOK AROUND SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF THAT 
AND WE'LL GET TOGETHER LATER AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF THE WHOLE THING 
THIS CERTAINLY IS A REALLY BIG BATHROOM IT'S MASSIVE 
AS BIG AS IT LOOKED ON THE LAPTOP 
IT IS DEFINITELY BUT I JUST DON'T LIKE IT 
I DON'T LIKE THE TILES AND THE CARPET 
IT HASN'T GOT A SHOWER SO WE'D HAVE TO RIP IT OUT AND START AGAIN 
OH WOW THIS IS A FANTASTIC SPACE 
IT'S A GOOD SPACE A BIT CREEPY BUT PERHAPS WE COULD DO THE WINE MAKING DOWN HERE 
NO YOU WANT A BIG T. V. SCREEN LEATHER SOFA FANTASTIC ALL ME GAMES CONSOLES IT'LL BE EXCELLENT 
NO NO NO 
SO MARK AND VANESSA YOU'VE SEEN BOTH THE HOUSES SO ON THE DAY WHICH PROVED TO BE THE BEST 
I THINK THIS HOUSE PROVED TO BE 
YEAH I THINK THIS HOUSE WAS 
DEFINITELY YEAH I THOUGHT THAT THE MYSTERY HOUSE WAS AN ABSOLUTELY 
CERTAINLY LOVED THE DECORATION AND THE VIEW OUT TO THE COUNTRY 
BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH BIGGER THAN THE HOUSE WE'RE MOVING FROM 
UNLIKE THIS ONE OF COURSE WHICH HAS GOT BAGS OF SPACE 
SO DO YOU LIKE IT ENOUGH TO PUT IN AN OFFER TODAY 
I WOULD BE VERY TEMPTED TO PUT IN AN OFFER 
DESPITE THE FACT THERE'S A LOT OF MAINTENANCE TO DO AND THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS DOING 
BUT I DON'T LIKE IT ENOUGH TO PUT AN OFFER IN 
IT DOESN'T DO IT FOR ME I'M AFRAID 
SO BASICALLY MARK YOU LIKE IT 
I LIKE IT YEAH BUT VANESSA YOU'RE NOT SOLD NO NOT AT ALL 
OFTEN IT IS ABOUT GUT REACTION WHEN YOU WALK INTO A HOUSE DEFINITELY 
I THINK THAT IN A WAY 
YOU'RE SO FOCUSSED ON YOUR ECO WARRIORISM THAT YOU'RE ALMOST 
A LITTLE BIT BLURRED ON WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN A HOUSE 
SO I THINK MY ADVICE WOULD REALLY BE TO START OFF MY FOCUSSING ON YOUR 
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL LISTS FOR YOUR PROPERTY AND THEN ADD THE ECO FRIENDLINESS ON TOP OF IT 
I THINK THAT MIGHT HELP YOU TO REALLY DEFINE YOUR SEARCH 
WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL EVENTUALLY TURN UP THE RIGHT PROPERTY 
I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT WHERE YOU TURN OUT 
AND WHETHER YOU GET THE SHEEP AND THE GOATS 
SO I WISH YOU BOTH THE BEST OF LUCK 
O. K. THANKS THANKS A LOT 
SINCE FILMING MARK AND VANESSA HAVE DECIDED TO FOCUS THEIR SEARCH CLOSER TO HOME AND ARE NOW 
CONCENTRATING ON THE NEWARK AREA AND THE VILLAGES AROUND LONG BENNINGTON
