AND LIVE IN ONE OF LONDON'S MOST EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBOURHOODS BUT WANT TO SWAP IT FOR A HOME IN THE COUNTRY 
ADDING THREE HOURS TO YOUR DAILY COMMUTE SOUNDS CRAZY OR DOES IT 
LEAFY AVENUES OF GENTEEL VICTORIAN MANSIONS TYPIFY THE EXCLUSIVE NORTH LONDON SUBURB OF HAMPSTEAD 
WHICH UNTIL THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WAS A VILLAGE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY 
BUT TIMES HAVE CHANGED THE URBAN SPRAWL HAS NOW COMPLETELY SWALLOWED IT UP MAINLY DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF THE NORTH LONDON RAILWAY IN THE MID EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS WHICH FERRIED COMMUTERS IN AND OUT OF THE CITY 
THERE ARE NOW THREE DIFFERENT RAIL LINES THUNDERING THROUGH THE AREA 
PLUS THE BUSY FINCHLEY ROAD 
WHICH CONNECTS LONDON TO THE M. ONE 
SO WHILE THE COMMUTERS MAY BE HAPPY IT DOESN'T MAKE FOR A VERY QUIET LIFE 
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THIS IS STILL ONE OF THE MOST ASPIRATIONAL POSTCODES IN LONDON 
DESIGNER SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS ATTRACT LADIES WHO LUNCH AND THE RICH AND FAMOUS 
FROM STEPHEN FRY TO JERRY SPRINGER NEARLY THIRTY PER CENT OF RESIDENTS ENJOY MORTGAGE FREE LIVING WELL ABOVE 
THE LONDON AVERAGE AND LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS RECKON THAT PRICES WILL GO AS HIGH AS PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY 
THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A FOUR BEDROOMED HOUSE IS A STAGGERING ONE MILLION 
SO WHILST MOST OF US CAN ONLY DREAM OF STEPPING 
ONTO THE HAMPSTEAD PROPERTY LADDER JULES HINDS IS PREPARING TO MAKE A GREAT BIG LEAP OFF IT 
THE COMINGS AND GOINGS OF URBAN LIVING HAVE FINALLY TAKEN THEIR TOLL 
ON JULES AND SHE INCREASINGLY FEELS LIKE JUST ANOTHER FACE IN THE CROWD 
I GET UP IN THE MORNING AND THERE'S A WHOLE SEA OF FACES AND A CACOPHONY OF SOUND 
WHILST I HAVE SUPER NEIGHBOURS EITHER SIDE OF ME I'D LIKE TO 
GET BACK OUT INTO A COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE SAY GOOD MORNING TO YOU IN THE MORNING 
TO ESCAPE THE FACELESS CITY JULES LIKES TO GET BACK TO NATURE BY DOING A SPOT OF GARDENING 
THAT'S EASIER SAID THAT DONE IN A TYPICALLY SIZED LONDON GARDEN 
I REALLY LOVE GETTING MY HANDS DIRTY 
IT'S MY THERAPY AFTER WORK AND A WAY OF SELF EXPRESSION BUT YOU CAN SEE 
IT'S JUST A TYPICAL LONDON GARDEN THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM 
I BUY HEAPS OF STUFF AND I REALLY NEED SOMEWHERE LARGER 
MORE OF A PROJECT AND I REALLY WANT TO GET BACK TO NATURE 
JULES BOUGHT HER TWO BEDROOMED GARDEN FLAT FOR FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN SHE DIVORCED 
SHE HASN'T DONE ANY WORK TO THE FLAT OTHER THAN SPRUCING IT UP BUT HOUSE PRICES IN THE AREA HAVE SHOT UP 
SO I'VE ASKED TWO ESTATE AGENTS TO GIVE US A VALUATION 
OFF THE MAIN CORRIDOR YOU COME TO THE MASTER BEDROOM AT THE FRONT OF THE FLAT 
A GOOD SIZED ROOM WITH THE ADDED BENEFIT OF AN EN SUITE BATHROOM 
ACROSS THE HALL IS THE GUEST BATHROOM WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE GUEST DOUBLE BEDROOM 
AT THE BACK OF THE FLAT IS THE MAIN LIVING ACCOMMODATION 
A GOOD SIZED LIVING ROOM LEADING TO THE KITCHEN SLASH BREAKFAST ROOM 
BEING A BASEMENT FLAT DOES HAVE A TENDENCY TO BE ON THE DARK SIDE 
HAVING THE BIG WIDE DOORS LEADING ONTO THE GARDEN COMPENSATES FOR THAT 
THROUGH THE DINING AREA IS A MODERN KITCHEN WITH DIRECT ACCESS TO A BIJOU TERRACED GARDEN AT THE BACK 
THIS PATIO GARDEN IS ONE OF THE SELLING POINTS OF THE FLAT 
ALTHOUGH IT'S SMALL YOUR LIKELY BUYERS SINGLE WORKING COUPLES 
HAVEN'T GOT MUCH TIME TO MAINTAIN ANYTHING LARGER 
ACCORDING TO HER MUM LIZ JULES HAS A TENDENCY TO HAVE HER HEAD IN THE CLOUDS 
SO SHE'S COMING ALONG TO KEEP HER DAUGHTER'S FEET ON THE GROUND 
JULES AND MUM LIZ FIRST THINGS FIRST 
WE'VE HAD YOUR VERY TRENDY LONDON PAD VALUED THE AGENTS RECKON THAT 
YOU COULD EXPECT TO ACHIEVE AT THE MOST FIVE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
THAT'S EXCELLENT IS THAT GOOD NEWS IT IS WHEN I CONSIDER WHAT I BOUGHT IT FOR 
WHAT I'M MOST INTERESTED IN IS HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'VE GOT TO SPEND ON YOUR NEW COUNTRY HOUSE 
SOMETHING BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY AND FIVE HUNDRED K. 
GOSH QUITE A RANGE YES WHERE AM I GOING TO BE LOOKING 
I WANT TO LOOK IN THE COTSWOLDS 
STOW THE SLAUGHTERS AROUND THAT AREA WHICH IS PARTICULARLY BEAUTIFUL 
IT HAS TO BE AT THE MOMENT ANYWAY COMMUTABLE DEFINITELY TWO BEDROOMS AS A MINIMAL 
I'D REALLY LIKE ANY EN SUITE BATHROOM AND SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO 
A PUB WOULD BE GREAT THAT'S THE HEART OF THE VILLAGE WHERE YOU CAN MEET FOLK 
WHAT ABOUT WISH LIST ITEMS WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU ABSOLUTELY FALL IN LOVE WITH THE PROPERTY 
SOMEWHERE QUITE OPEN I QUITE LIKE THE WHOLE FEELING OF SPACE 
YOU ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT COTTAGES TEND TO COME WITH SMALLER ROOMS BY THE FACT THEY ARE COTTAGES 
WHAT SORT OF THINGS DO YOU THINK JULES SHOULD BE BEARING IN MIND 
I THINK DEFINITELY STORAGE 
SHE'S THE WORLD'S WORST FOR KEEPING THINGS 
WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT I'M ABOUT TO GO TO ONE OF THE PROPERTY HOTSPOTS IN THE COUNTRY 
YOU HAVE GOT A GOOD BUDGET 
I THINK WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO IS MARRY LIZ AND MY PRAGMATISM AND THE JULIE WISH LIST 
THIS IS THE EASY BIT YOU JUST KEEP LOGGED ONTO THE LAPTOP AND I'LL SEND YOU BACK PICTURES OF THE HOUSES 
HOPEFULLY I'LL COME UP WITH YOUR DREAM PROPERTY FANTASTIC 
EVEN WITH JULES' HALF A MILLION POUND BUDGET WE ARE LOOKING IN ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR AREAS OF 
THE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S SO PRETTY AND IT'S ACCESSIBLE TO LONDON 
SO I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MANAGE SOME OF JULES' VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS 
WILL JULES' BUDGET BUY HER THE PROPERTY OF HER DREAMS 
WELL IT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE 
SHE WANTS A COTTAGE WITH TWO BEDROOMS AND TWO BATHROOMS 
OUTSIDE HAS TO BE UP TO SCRATCH WITH A LARGE GARDEN AND PARKING 
NOT FORGETTING BEING CLOSE TO THOSE TRANSPORT LINKS 
THESE ROLLING HILLS ARE HOME TO OUR FUTURE KING A CATWALK QUEEN AND AN 
A LIST HOLLYWOOD STAR ALL DRAWN TO THE AREA'S PICTURE POSTCARD SCENERY 
THIS MAY BE A WORLD AWAY FROM THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF THE CITY 
BUT THIS AREA BOASTS ENOUGH FAMOUS RESIDENTS TO RIVAL THE CAPITAL 
PRINCE CHARLES KATE MOSS AND KATE WINSLET ALL HAVE HOMES HERE AND IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE WHY 
THE CELEBRATED COUNTRYSIDE AND DISTINCTIVE ARCHITECTURE 
MAKE THIS ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST RECOGNISABLE FILM SETS 
IT'S RECENTLY FEATURED IN BOX OFFICE HITS HARRY POTTER AND BRIDGET JONES 
DESPITE THE INVASION OF URBANITES AND FILM CREWS LOCALS ARE FIERCELY PROTECTIVE OF THEIR RURAL HERITAGE 
EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE COTSWOLDS IS STILL FARMLAND AND 
IT ONLY HAS A POPULATION OF EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS 
DEMAND FOR PROPERTY HERE IS HIGH 
ONCE PEOPLE MOVE HERE THEY TEND TO STAY PUT 
SO THE CHARACTERISTIC LIMESTONE HOUSES ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY 
HALF A MILLION POUNDS MIGHT NOT GO QUITE AS FAR AS JULES HOPES 
I BEGIN MY SEARCH IN JULES' FAVOURITE PART OF THE COTSWOLDS 
THE TINY VILLAGE OF LOWER SWELL IS JUST FOUR MILES NORTH OF THE SLAUGHTERS 
THERE ISN'T TOO MUCH ON OFFER IN LOWER SWELL BUT IF JULES WANTS 
ALL OF HER AMENITIES ON THE DOORSTEP THEN STOW ON THE WOLD IS ONE MILE 
UP THE ROAD IN THAT DIRECTION WHERE SHE'LL FIND SHOPS RESTAURANTS AND BARS 
MY FIRST PROPERTY IS ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND LEAVING JULES WITH VERY LITTLE CHANGE FROM HER BUDGET 
THIS QUIRKY THREE BEDROOMED COTTAGE HAS AN UNUSUAL LAYOUT AS IT'S ATTACHED TO TWO OTHER PROPERTIES 
LOTS OF CHARACTER NICE WINDOWS 
MEANWHILE BACK IN HAMPSTEAD JULES AND LIZ ARE KEEPING TABS ON MY SEARCH BY THE LAPTOP 
THIS COTTAGE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOT LOADS OF PERIOD CHARACTER 
IT DOES AS WE COME IN SEEING THE FLAGSTONES HERE 
WHAT AGE IS IT SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
IT'S A LOVELY HALL I LIKE THAT STEP DOWN I LIKE THE DOOR 
A COUPLE OF WINDOWS QUITE LIGHT 
WHAT'S DOWN THERE DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM THAT'S A HANDY THING TO HAVE 
IT SPLITS IN TWO DIRECTIONS SHALL WE GO THIS WAY FIRST 
LET'S DO THE DINING ROOM 
I LIKE THE FACT YOU GO UP LITTLE STEPS IT'S A NICE FEATURE 
PRESUMABLY THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE ON A SLIGHT HILL HERE THAT'S RIGHT RIGHT SO A LITTLE DINING ROOM 
A QUITE SPACIOUS DINING ROOM 
IT IS A GOOD SIZED ROUND TABLE THE DINING ROOM LOOKS FANTASTIC IT DOES VERY VERY NICE THAT 
I LIKE THE FACT YOU'VE GOT THREE WINDOWS SO LOTS OF LIGHT 
FOR A COTTAGE THIS FEELS VERY SPACIOUS DOESN'T IT IT DOES YES 
I LIKE THE FACT IT'S VERY LIGHT WHICH IS QUITE UNUSUAL FOR COTTAGES ESPECIALLY OF THAT PERIOD 
A FORMAL DINING SPACE HERE AND THEN IT LOOKS LIKE IT 
GOES THROUGH INTO THE KITCHEN SHALL WE GO THROUGH HERE NEXT JAMIE 
THIS IS A VERY GOOD SIZE AS WELL JAMIE YEAH GOOD SPACE FOR A SMALL TABLE AS WELL 
QUITE A NICE SIZED KITCHEN NOT OVER SURE ABOUT THE COLOUR 
NO I LIKE THE SIZE OF THE KITCHEN AND THE FACT YOU CAN PUT A TABLE IN THERE QUITE DARK 
BUT THE BASICS OF THE ROOM ARE BRILLIANT AS IN SIZE THERE'S LOVELY FLAGS IN HERE AS WELL 
YES ON ALL OF THE GROUND FLOOR YOU'VE GOT FLAGSTONE FLOORING 
LOVELY I LIKE THE FLAGS 
I THINK THEY GIVE THE KITCHEN A LOT OF CHARACTER 
THEN DOOR OUTSIDE 
YES THIS IS YOUR BACK GARDEN RIGHT 
I LIKE THE STABLE DOOR I REALLY LIKE THAT IT'S A COTTAGEY FEEL 
IS THIS THE ONLY BIT OF OUTSIDE SPACE NO THERE IS MORE GARDEN BUT YOU ACCESS IT FROM THE SITTING ROOM 
SO IT'S ROUND THE OTHER SIDE ROUND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE ALL VERY PAVED AT THE MOMENT 
I SUPPOSE IT'S LOW MAINTENANCE 
WHAT'S THROUGH THAT GATE THERE YOU'VE GOT THE GARAGE AT THE BACK 
JULES IS PLAGUED BY TRAFFIC WARDENS SO SHE'LL LOVE THE IDEA OF HAVING HER OWN SPACE TO PARK 
I COULD ACTUALLY PARK MY CAR GET MY SHOPPING OUT WITHOUT HAVING 
TO GIVE MYSELF A CARDIAC ARREST BEFORE I GET IN 
THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK BACK FROM THE OTHER SIDE YOU CAN TELL IT'S ALMOST IN A TERRACE 
IT'S JOINED ON BOTH SIDES THIS PROPERTY YES 
THAT'S A SEPARATE DWELLING AND SO IS THIS 
SO IS THAT YEAH SLIGHTLY LOOKING ONTO YOUR PATIO AREN'T THEY 
YES THEY ARE SLIGHTLY IF YOU'VE GOT HOUSES OVERLOOKING THAT SPACE THEN THAT'S LACK OF PRIVACY 
IT MEANS YOU'RE SECURE BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT I'D WANT THEM PEEPING OUT OF THE CURTAINS LOOKING AT ME 
OH VERY GOOD SIZE ISN'T IT 
YES VERY GOOD SIZE THE LIVING ROOM'S LOVELY LOOK AT THE FIREPLACE 
AND LIGHT JULIE AS WELL LOVELY FIREPLACE THAT'S AMAZING ISN'T IT 
INGLENOOK FIREPLACE YEAH IT REALLY DOES STAND OUT AND IT'S THE FOCAL POINT OF THE ROOM ABSOLUTELY 
THE FIREPLACE IS GREAT 
AND I NICE LITTLE WINDOW SEAT FROM WHICH TO ENJOY THE GARDEN 
QUITE SMALL THOUGH 
I THINK IT'S VERY PRETTY 
I'M NOT SURE 
IT'S PRETTY BUT SMALL 
THE STAIRS LEAD UP FROM THE DINING ROOM ONTO A NICE LITTLE LANDING HERE 
I LIKE THE FACT IT GOES OFF IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS 
JULES WILL LIKE THE QUIRKY LAYOUT IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT 
IT'S CHARACTER IN THIS COTTAGE I THINK 
A STORAGE CUPBOARD THERE ON THE LANDING SO THAT'LL KEEP MUM HAPPY 
FANTASTIC FOR YOU YOU NEEDS LOTS OF STORAGE 
I'LL PUT ALL MY JUNK IN THERE THE FIRST TWO BEDROOMS ARE AT THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
THIS WOULD BE JULES' GUEST ROOM 
THAT WOULD BE MY BEDROOM WOULDN'T IT 
IT WOULD BE GUEST BEDROOM YES IT FEELS MORE COTTAGEY UPSTAIRS THERE'S A PROPER LITTLE 
COTTAGE WINDOW JUST ABOUT SPACE FOR A DOUBLE BED BUT THERE IS A GOOD FITTED CUPBOARD AS WELL 
IT MIGHT NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE CHARACTER 
THEN THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ROOM THE MASTER BEDROOM 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO JUDGE THIS BECAUSE THEY'VE ACTUALLY TAKEN THE BED OUT OF IT 
IT SEEMS VERY SPACIOUS YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE A LARGE DOUBLE ROOM FOR YOUR SLEIGH BED WOULDN'T YOU 
IF I TAKE THAT WITH ME YEAH TO GIVE AN IDEA OF SIZE IT'S ABOUT THIRTEEN F. T. X. THIRTEEN F. T. 
AGAIN A DECENT SIZE FOR A COTTAGE 
THE SPACIOUSNESS OF THE CEILING IS A REAL BONUS ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE HOW 
THESE BEAMS HERE ARE GOING TO RATE ON THE JULES BEAMOMETER 
I LIKE THE AIRINESS OF IT 
THE HEIGHT ERM 
I'LL HAVE TO BE A WEE BIT CAREFUL ABOUT BANGING YOUR HEAD ON THOSE BEAMS 
BACK ACROSS THE HALLWAY AND THEN UP A FEW MORE STEPS 
SO YOU ARE KIND OF RISING UP OVER THE DINING ROOM HERE AND THEN INTO THE ALL IMPORTANT BATHROOM 
NOW GIVEN THAT JULES HAS VERY HIGH BATHROOM STANDARDS THIS ONE REALLY IS NOT GOING TO CUT THE MUSTARD 
IT'S A VERY SMALL AND B. INCREDIBLY DATED 
AND FINALLY NEXT DOOR IS THE THIRD BEDROOM 
DEFINITELY A SINGLE ALTHOUGH IT'S GOT A GOOD FITTED WARDROBE IN THERE 
IT IS TINY THAT IT'S GOT STORAGE BUT THEY DON'T HALF LIKE FRILLS AND FUSS 
THIS IS ONE OF THE ROOMS THAT JAMIE TELLS ME HAS ADDED TO THE HEFTY PRICE TAG 
AND IT'S A SHAME IN A WAY BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT TO CONVERT 
INTO A BATHROOM OBVIOUSLY GIVEN THE DISTANCE FROM THE MASTER BEDROOM IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE AN EN SUITE 
SO NO EN SUITE BUT THIS THREE BEDROOM COTSWOLD COTTAGE 
IS DECEPTIVE IN SIZE AND IT HAS LOTS OF POTENTIAL INSIDE 
THE OUTSIDE SPACE MAY BE LIMITED BUT THERE IS ALSO THAT GARAGE 
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THIS PROPERTY HAS ALL THE PERIOD CHARM BUT 
JULES IS AFTER AND IT'S SMACK BANG IN HER PERFECT LOCATION 
WE'LL JUST WAIT TO SEE WHETHER SHE THINKS IT'S WORTH IT BE VERY HEFTY PRICE TAG 
FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE I'LL HAVE TO RIP THE KITCHEN AND THE BATHROOM OUT THAT WOULD PROBABLY ADD AN EXTRA WHAT FIFTY K. ON TOP 
VERY TOPPY I THINK FOR THAT 
BEDROOMS QUITE SMALL REALLY THEY WERE DISAPPOINTING THE BEDROOMS YES 
FIFTEEN MILES WEST IS MY SECOND VILLAGE TEMPLE GUITING 
I'VE DONE MY OWN RESEARCH AND COMMUTING WHY IS THIS IS THE PERFECT LOCATION FOR JULES 
WALTON IN MARSH AND KINGHAM ARE BOTH ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES' DRIVE FROM HERE 
AND BOTH TOWNS OFFER FAST REGULAR TRAIN SERVICES TO LONDON 
THIS PEACEFUL VILLAGE LIES IN THE IDYLLIC WINDRUSH VALLEY 
AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS ONE OF THE GEMS OF THE COTSWOLDS 
BUT WILL MY SECOND PROPERTY LURE JULES BACK TO THE COUNTRYSIDE AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS OF A CITY LIFE 
COLLEGE BARN COTTAGE IS OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OLD 
IT IS ON THE MARKET FOR AT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND THE CURRENT OWNER SUE BLANEY IS GOING TO SHOW ME AROUND 
HI CATHERINE HOW ARE YOU SUE NICE TO SEE YOU 
OH A LOVELY LITTLE PORCH YOU'VE GOT IN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
IT'S LOVELY IN THE SUMMER WE'VE GOT THE TWO WISTERIAS AND THE ROSES WISTERIA YOU LOVE THAT DON'T YOU 
WELL YEAH I DO AND I REALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT IT'S GOT A PORCH WHERE 
YOU CAN PUT YOUR LOGS AND I LIKE THAT LITTLE BIT OF GARDEN AT THE FRONT 
IT'S VERY PRETTY TO THE CAT FROM THE FRONT AND SO HERE'S THE ROOM A LONG THIN ROOM 
IT IS IT IS BUT YOU HAVE THE DOUBLE ASPECT WINDOWS WHICH ARE REALLY USEFUL 
THAT IS GOOD SO EVEN THOUGH IT IS COTTAGEY PROPORTIONS YOU HAVE GOT LOTS OF NATURAL LIGHT IN IT YES 
QUITE NARROW ROOM IT SEEMS TO BE 
YEAH IT LOOKS BUT THEN THEY'VE GOT QUITE A LOT OF PICTURES AND 
FURNITURE CLUTTERING IT ALL UP AND I REALLY LIKE THE STONE THOUGH 
I BET IT GETS TOASTY ONCE YOU'VE GOT THAT PACKING OUT SOME HEAT YES 
WE HAVE TO SWITCH THE HEATING OFF WE COME BACK ACROSS THE HALLWAY THERE'S THE FRONT DOOR 
INTO THE KITCHEN I LOVE THAT KITCHEN I REALLY LIKE THAT KITCHEN IT'S REALLY NICE AND CLEAN 
I REALLY LIKE I KNOW IT SOUNDS MAD BUT THAT COLOURED PAINT IT'S VERY HERITAGE REALLY NICE REALLY PRETTY 
IT'S YOUR COLOUR IT'S MORE ME 
SO THIS LOOKS LIKE A GOOD KITCHEN IT WAS DESIGNED BECAUSE I COOK A LOT 
SO THIS IS THE PREPARATION AREA WITH ITS OWN SEPARATE SINK 
O. K. THEN I HAVE THE WASHING MACHINE AND A BUTLER SINK MORE LIKE A UTILITY AREA 
IT'S QUITE AN INTERESTING SHAPE BECAUSE THEN THE UTILITY BIT IS ROUND THE CORNER 
OH IT'S A LOVELY ROOM REALLY NICE IT'S THE GARDEN ROOM IT'S LOVELY 
NOW THOSE WINDOWS LOOK DO THEY FOLD BACK 
THEY DO THEY HAVE GOT HINGES AND THEY FOLD BACK ON TO 
THE OUTSIDE WALL SO THE WHOLE OF THAT SPACE IS JUST ON TO THE GARDEN 
THAT'S A SUPER FEATURE ISN'T IT YES LOVELY I REALLY LIKE THAT 
I WANTED THAT FEEL OF BRINGING THE GARDEN INTO THE HOUSE 
NOW SUE HAS VERY CAREFULLY CREATED LOTS OF DIFFERENT SEATING AREAS 
HERE'S ONE BEHIND ME SO YOU CAN CATCH THE SUN AT VARIOUS TIMES OF THE DAY IF IT'S SHINING OF COURSE 
IT BORDERS ON TO WOODLAND AND THAT IS A NEIGHBOUR'S GARDEN NEXT DOOR BUT YOU DON'T FEEL OVERLOOKED 
THIS IS A DULY LAND GARDEN 
AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE THERE'S PARKING FOR 
AT LEAST TWO CARS AND A GARAGE WHICH I KNOW WILL BE MUSIC TO JULES'S EARS 
WE GET A GARAGE AS WELL 
WHICH IS JUST COMPLETELY YEAH I MEAN THAT IS FANTASTIC 
SO THE STAIRS LEAD UP THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE COTTAGE SO IT HAS A REALLY NICE SYMMETRY TO IT 
THERE ARE THREE BEDROOMS HERE THE FIRST ONE IS AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
NOW THIS IS THE SMALLEST IT'S A SINGLE 
BUT WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS THAT SUE'S PUT LOTS OF 
LITTLE QUIRKY AND INNOVATIVE EXTRAS INTO THE ROOM SO THAT IS LIKE A BUILT IN BED AND CUPBOARD SPACE 
AT THE BACK OF THE COTTAGE HERE IN THE CENTRE IS THE GUEST BATHROOM 
I SHOULD CALL IT A SHOWER ROOM IT DOESN'T HAVE A BATH 
REALLY BEAUTIFULLY FITTED AND A SORT OF POWER SHOWER IN IT 
SPARE BATHROOM GUEST BATHROOM AND LOOK AT THE POWER SHOWER FABULOUS 
THAT IS FAB THEN ACROSS THE HALLWAY WE ARE NOW OVER THE SITTING ROOM 
THIS WOULD BE THE MAIN GUEST ROOM LOVELY 
AND THERE IS SPACE FOR A PRETTY GOOD SIZED DOUBLE BED HERE 
IT IS ALSO WORTH POINTING OUT THAT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN FAIRLY FRESHLY AND IT NEUTRALLY DECORATED BY SUE 
BUT THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE FOR ME IN THIS PROPERTY LIES UP 
THIS SECOND FLIGHT OF STAIRS SO YES WE'RE GOING RIGHT UP INTO THE RAFTERS 
INTO WHAT WE MIGHT CALL A MASTER SUITE CHARACTER IS AMAZING 
YES LOVELY ISN'T IT I'M BEGINNING TO FALL FOR THIS HOUSE BIG TIME THIS COTTAGE 
IT ISN'T HUGE BUT I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS COSY AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT 
IS THAT IT HAS LOTS OF DIFFERENT WINDOWS SO IT'S GOT PLENTY OF NATURAL LIGHT THAT'S REALLY NICE 
I LIKE THE BEAMS IT'S ALL REALLY FRESH NICELY MAINTAINED 
THE THING THAT'S REALLY GOING TO APPEAL TO JULES IS I FOUND HER 
A READY MADE EN SUITE BATHROOM AND WHAT AN EN SUITE BATHROOM IT IS 
I WANT TO PUT AN OFFER IN ALREADY 
ALL BEAUTIFULLY AND TASTEFULLY KITTED OUT BY SUE 
IT'S GOT A FREE STANDING CLAW FOOT BATH AND OTHER LOVELY FIXTURES AND FITTINGS 
TO ME IS JUST CRYING OUT TO BE A HOME TO ALL JULES'S LOVELY PRODUCTS AND POTIONS 
YEAH I REALLY LIKE THIS COTTAGE YOU'VE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH IT YEAH I HAVE 
STILL TO COME ON ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRY A HOUSE OF TWO HALVES 
WHERE JULES FINDS THE LIVING ROOM OF HER DREAMS 
I ALWAYS GET THE GOOSE BUMP THING GOING ON IF I REALLY LIKE SOMETHING HAVE YOU GOT IT 
SO ER YES I HAVE 
AND THE BATHROOM OF HER NIGHTMARES 
CAN'T BE TOO RUDE IT'S HORRIBLE 
IT'S DREADFUL IT'S A SHOCKER 
IT IS THE SECOND DAY OF MY SEARCH FOR JULES'S DREAM HOME 
AND I HAVE TRAVELLED JUST THREE MILES SOUTH OF THOSE ALL IMPORTANT TRAIN LINKS IN MORETON IN MARSH 
I'M IN THE HISTORIC VILLAGE OF BLOCKLEY IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT THIS SLEEPY CORNER OF THE COTSWOLDS 
WAS ONCE HOME TO A THRIVING SILK INDUSTRY 
THIS FIVE BEDROOM COTTAGE WITH A CONVERTED GARAGE AND 
THREE BATHROOMS IS ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND WELL THAT'S A SURPRISE 
IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE 
AND BEST OF ALL IT IS DETACHED 
BUT WHETHER IT IS THE CHOCOLATE BOX COTTAGE JULES IS AFTER IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN 
THIS LOOKS LIKE A SUBSTANTIAL PROPERTY IT IS IT IS A GOOD SIZE TYPICALLY VICTORIAN 
SO THE GARDEN IS SO CRUCIAL THING I BELIEVE THIS IS THE GARDEN ISN'T IT THIS IS THE GARDEN 
I THINK IT'S THE FACT THAT IT IS ALL AT THE FRONT HAS ALARMED SOME PEOPLE 
IT'S DETACHED I LIKE THE NICE SWEEPING DRIVE 
SO IN WE COME THERE IS A USEFUL COAT HANGING AND BOOT AREA THERE A LITTLE PORCHWAY 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE THE CLOAKROOM 
OH EXCELLENT DOWNSTAIRS LOO RIGHT SO IF WE GO HERE FIRST 
LOVELY BIG SPACIOUS DINING ROOM 
I'M NOT SURE HOW I AM FEELING ABOUT THIS ONE YET 
I'M KIND OF NOT WARMING TO IT IMMEDIATELY 
I FEEL THE SAME ABOUT THIS PROPERTY 
LOTS OF OLD FEATURES BUT ALSO SOME NEW ADDITIONS I AM NOTICING 
HAVE THE WINDOWS BEEN PUT IN RECENTLY 
YES THE OWNERS HAVE PUT MOST OF THE WINDOWS IN THEY HAVE RENOVATED EVERYTHING YOU SEE 
IT'S GOT A NICE LITTLE WOOD BURNER 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT ALL THOSE BEAMS THEY'RE NOT LIKE THEY'RE NOT THE NICE BEAMS NOT THE ORIGINAL 
I LIKE THE DOORS ARE THESE ORIGINALS THEY LOOK LIKE ORIGINALS BUT THE OWNERS PUT THEM IN 
OH O. K. GOSH HE REALLY HAS DONE A LOT IN THE TIME HE HAS BEEN HERE 
YES IT'S GOT A COLD FEEL ABOUT IT I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN IT'S SEEMS DRAB 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE FURNISHINGS OR JUST THE FACT THAT IS SO NEUTRAL 
NOTHING IS JUMPING OUT AT ME AT THE MOMENT 
IS THIS COTSWOLD STONE THEY USED IT IS COTSWOLD STONE IT IS UNUSUAL IT IS UNUSUAL 
NICE OPEN FIRE IT IS A BLANK CANVAS BUT THEY HAVE NOT PUT MUCH COLOUR ON 
I WOULD DESCRIBE THIS ROOM AS COSY IT HAS WINDOWS LOOKING OUT OVER THE GARDEN AND 
A WINDOW THERE BUT THAT DOESN'T GIVE THAT MUCH LIGHT 
THE CEILINGS ARE QUITE LOW AND IT JUST SEEMS A BIT DARK 
CROSSING BACK OVER THE DINING ROOM INTO THE HALLWAY AND THEN 
INTO THE KITCHEN RIGHT 
GOSH THIS IS A SURPRISE HOW COME WE SUDDENLY HAVE SO MUCH HEIGHT 
THIS IS AN ADDITION FROM THE EIGHTIES 
THEY'VE REACTED TO THE LOW CEILINGS NEXT DOOR AND GONE WILDLY HIGH HERE 
WAS THIS PUT IN BY THE CURRENT OWNER 
THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE WASN'T BUT THE KITCHEN WAS 
SO THIS IS ALL FAIRLY NEWLY FITTED I DON'T LIKE THIS I DON'T 
THERE'S NO NATURAL LIGHT COMING IN THROUGH THE WALLS 
SO THIS MUST BE THE GARAGE WHICH I CAN SEE FROM THE OUTSIDE IS OBVIOUSLY NO LONGER A GARAGE 
THE CURRENT OWNER CONVERTED THIS FOR WHEELCHAIR ACCESS 
BEDROOM AND BATHROOM AT THE BOTTOM 
EXCELLENT EXTRA SPACE IF YOU HAVE GOT GUESTS COMING 
COMING UP TO THE FIRST FLOOR THE FIRST DOOR IS THE BATHROOM 
IT IS FAIRLY SMALL BUT IT IS REALLY NICELY FITTED 
I LOVE THE FACT THEY HAVE LEFT THE EXPOSED STONE WORK SO YOU REALLY CAN GET THE COTSWOLD FEEL 
IT IS QUITE A PLEASANT BATHROOM 
SO THE FIRST OF THE BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS HERE IS PRETTY TINY IT HAS A LITTLE GIRL'S BED 
VERY SMALL ISN'T IT STORAGE THOUGH 
THIS IS THE MAIN BEDROOM 
IT HAS A REALLY NICE FEEL TO IT AND TWO WINDOWS SO LIGHT COMING IN ON BOTH SIDES 
SIZE WISE THIS DEFINITELY FEELS MORE LIKE A HOUSE THAN A COTTAGE IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL PROPERTY 
I HAVE COME UP TO ANOTHER WHOLE FLOOR OF ROOMS THE CURRENT OWNER 
HAS OPENED UP THE LOFT SPACE HERE TO CREATE A SHOWER ROOM IN HERE VERY NEW AND FUNKY 
AND THEN IN HERE THIS IS WHAT IS EFFECTIVELY BEDROOM FOUR 
CURRENTLY BEING USED AS AN OFFICE JULES COULD DO THE SAME 
OR THERE IS PLENTY OF SPACE FOR A REALLY BIG SINGLE BED 
THEN NEXT DOOR 
THIS IS BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE FIFTH BEDROOM 
WOULD JULES HAVE BELIEVED SHE COULD AFFORD FIVE BEDROOMS 
I FEEL REALLY FLAT QUITE DISAPPOINTED 
SO I FOUND DETACHED BUT THIS IS THERE FOR ME A HOUSE NOT A COTTAGE 
PLENTY OF SPACE EVEN IN THE LARGE FRONT GARDEN 
BUT THERE IS NO GETTING AWAY TO HOW DIFFERENT IT FEELS TO JULES'S IDEAL 
WELL IT'S NOT JULIE LAND CERTAINLY NOT 
MY FOURTH PROPERTY IS IN GREAT WALFORD JUST OVER THE BORDER INTO WARWICKSHIRE 
LAND IS CHEAPER BUT IT IS STILL WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF LONDON 
AS MORTON IN MARSH IS JUST FOUR MILES AWAY 
CHRISTMAS COTTAGE IS A PRETTY SEMI DETACHED PROPERTY WHICH SITS IN A HALF ACRE PLOT 
IT HAS THREE BEDROOMS A RANGE OF OUTBUILDINGS AND IT WOULD SET JULES BACK FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
IS THAT THE WHOLE THING DO YOU THINK 
IT LOOKS LARGER THAN FROM THE FRONT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE FRONT 
I'M MEETING UP WITH THE OWNER CLAIRE OLIVER 
SO I'VE COME IN THE SIDE ENTRANCE WHICH BRINGS US INTO THE KITCHEN 
BUT I NOTICED THIS HAS A DIFFERENT BRICK THIS PART OF THE HOUSE IS THIS A NEW EXTENSION 
THIS WAS ACTUALLY PUT UP ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO 
THE KITCHEN WAS FITTED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE EXTENSION 
KITCHEN'S VERY NICELY DONE OUT DON'T LIKE THE TILES VERY MODERN 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE A REALLY PRACTICAL GOOD SIZED KITCHEN 
DO YOU ENJOY A WORKING IN IT IT IS PROBABLY THE THING THAT SOLD THE HOUSE TO US 
THERE IS ONLY THE TWO OF US BUT WE HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS TO STAY WE LIVE IN HERE TO BE HONEST 
HEART OF THE HOME ROOM YES 
THE TABLE IS OBVIOUSLY INCORPORATED INTO THE KITCHEN AREA WHICH IS GOOD 
NOW I ASSUME THAT DOOR GOES OUT TO THE CAR PORT ON THE SIDE 
YES AND WHAT HAVE WE GOT IN HERE IN HERE WE HAVE A LAUNDRY AND A DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 
THERE IS A DINING ROOM THERE IS SHALL WE GO AND HAVE A LOOK 
RIGHT LOVELY DINING ROOM 
SO AS WE STEP THROUGH HERE WE ARE NOW IN THE ORIGINAL COTTAGE 
WE ARE THE OLDER PART SO WHEN WAS THIS BUILT CLAIRE 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY SIX RIGHT O. K. AND THERE ARE TWO COTTAGES IT'S SEMI DETACHED 
THERE'S ANOTHER COTTAGE NEXT DOOR WHICH FACES OUT 
ONTO THE ROAD WHEREAS WE FACE OUT ONTO OUR GARDEN 
RIGHT YES THAT'S LOVELY ACTUALLY THESE MUST BE ORIGINAL BEAMS 
THESE ARE ORIGINAL BEAMS 
I LIKE THEM I KNOW YOU PROBABLY THINK THERE'S TOO MANY 
FOR ME BUT IT'S NOT MY CHOICE 
AND I LOVE THE WINDOWS IT'S REALLY UNUSUAL TO SEE ORIGINAL WINDOWS 
THAT'S PRETTY FACING THE GARDEN 
IT WAS A NICE ASPECT ONTO THE GARDEN I THOUGHT THAT 
SO IF WE CARRY ON WE'RE COMING TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE YES 
IF WE HAVE A LOOK AT THE SITTING ROOM 
AH SO THAT LITTLE DOOR MUST BE THE FRONT DOOR YES 
HOW MUCH DO ACTUALLY USE IT CLAIRE 
NOT VERY MUCH REALLY WE TEND TO USE THE DOOR IN THE KITCHEN 
I'D REALLY WANT TO USE MY FRONT DOOR I'D LIKE TO MAKE FULL USE OF THAT 
NOT USING THAT MEANS YOUR SITTING ROOM ISN'T ACTING AS A HALLWAY 
NO SO IT POTENTIALLY MAKES THIS A MUCH BIGGER LIVING SPACE REALLY 
YES THE THING I REALLY LOVE ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU'VE GOT REALLY LOVELY WINDOWS ON BOTH SIDES 
NICELY PROPORTIONED ROOM QUITE LIGHT 
STAIRS GOING OFF FROM THE LOUNGE 
IT'S UM NOT MY IDEAL 
SO THERE IS HALF AN ACRE OF LAND WITH THIS PROPERTY 
AND IT LIES TO THE SIDE OF THIS HOUSE 
PART OF THE PLOT IS THIS LAWNED AREA 
WHICH BORDERS ONTO THE ROAD SO NOT ALL THAT PRIVATE AND YOU MIGHT HAVE NOISE FROM CARS GOING BY 
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE REST OF THE LAND IS SITUATED TO THE BACK AND IT BORDERS ONTO FARMLAND 
IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF LAND IT IS THE FRONT WORRIES ME A LITTLE BIT 
YOU KNOW HOW NOISE SENSITIVE I AM WITH THE NOISE FROM THE ROAD 
BUT YOU GET ALL THAT LAND 
THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE HERE THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS JULES WANTED 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE A GARDEN THAT SIZE 
YOU'RE MOVING TO THE COUNTRY TO HAVE A MORE RELAXING LIFESTYLE NOT BE WORRYING ABOUT YOUR GARDEN 
I CAN POTTER AT WEEKENDS AND I CAN ASK A GARDENER TO HELP ME IT'S MORE THAN POTTERING THAT SIZE 
THE OTHER THING SHE REALLY WANTS IS SOMEWHERE TO PARK HER CAR 
WELL ON THE SWEEP OF GRAVEL YOU CAN ACTUALLY PARK FIFTEEN 
AND THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER RATHER INTERESTING OUTBUILDING 
SO RATHER BIZARRELY THE OWNER BEFORE CLARE INSTALLED THIS AS A RECORDING STUDIO NO LESS 
FABULOUS YOU DO THINK YOU'RE BIT OF A SINGER DON'T YOU 
NOT A VERY GOOD ONE 
HE LOVED HIS MUSIC SO MUCH HE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO BACK 
IN THE HOUSE SO HE PUT IN A LOO AND BUILT HIMSELF A KIND OF BEDROOM 
I DON'T THINK JULES HAS GOT SUCH MUSICAL ASPIRATIONS AS THAT 
BUT THIS IS USEFUL EXTRA SPACE 
SHE COULD USE IT AS AN OFFICE SPACE IT'S ALL WIRED UP TO THE INTERNET 
JULES WILL BE PLEASED TO HEAR SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO SLEEP UP THERE 
THERE ARE OTHER SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS AND WE HEAD BACK IN THE HOUSE TO SEE THE BEDROOMS 
SO THERE ARE THREE BEDROOMS INSIDE THE COTTAGE 
THE FIRST IS THROUGH HERE YOU HAVE TO MIND YOUR HEAD 
THIS IS THE BIGGEST OF THE THREE AND SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEING USED AS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
IT'S QUITE QUAINT 
BACK ACROSS THE HALLWAY IS BEDROOM NUMBER TWO 
IT'S A VERY SMALL DOUBLE BUT IT'S AMPLE AS A GUEST ROOM 
LOVELY MUTUAL DECORATION AS WELL 
BEST PART FOR ME IS THE WINDOW IT DOES OVERLOOK THE ROAD 
SO POSSIBLE NOISE ISSUES BUT BEYOND THE ROAD YOU'VE GOT UNINTERRUPTED VIEWS OF ROLLING COUNTRYSIDE 
LOVELY VIEW SO WE COME TO BEDROOM NUMBER THREE 
THIS IS MOST DEFINITELY A SINGLE 
IN FACT CLAIRE IS CURRENTLY USING IT AS AN ENORMOUS WALK IN WARDROBE WHICH LIZ WILL PROBABLY APPROVE OF 
AN INDICATION THERE ISN'T TOO MUCH STORAGE IN THE OTHER BEDROOMS 
AND FINALLY RIGHT AT THE END OF THE COTTAGE IS THE BATHROOM 
IT'S A PRETTY DECENT SIZE ACTUALLY 
IT'S GOT A BATH AND SHOWER CUBICLE 
IT'S QUITE FAR AWAY FROM THE MAIN BEDROOM ISN'T IT 
NO PRIZES FOR SPOTTING THERE ISN'T 
AN EN SUITE IN THIS PROPERTY OR THE POTENTIAL TO PUT ONE IN 
BUT IF JULES WAS REALLY DESPERATE 
SHE COULD CONVERT THE SMALLEST OF THE BEDROOMS 
THE KITCHEN WILL SELL THAT HOUSE 
HAVING SEEN ALL FOUR PROPERTIES IT'S TIME FOR JULES TO DECIDE 
WHICH TWO SHE WANTS TO SEE IN THE FLESH 
CRANMER COTTAGE IS ON THE MARKET AT FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
WHICH JULES THOUGHT WAS PRICEY 
BUT I THINK THE COUNTRY COTTAGE FEEL 
ESPECIALLY IN THAT LIVING ROOM IS JUST WHAT SHE'S LOOKING FOR 
COLLEGE BARN COTTAGE ALSO HAS THE CHOCOLATE BOX APPEAL 
AND JULES PREFERRED THE KITCHEN AND BATHROOM HERE 
THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THE LONGER JOURNEY TO LONDON 
IT'S PRICED AT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
AT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND THREE CROWNS COTTAGE IS 
A SHORTER DRIVE TO THE STATION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IS DETACHED 
BUT IT LACKS CHARACTER 
AND ISN'T THE CHOCOLATE BOX COTTAGE SHE ASKED FOR 
CHRISTMAS COTTAGE HAS ALL THE OUTSIDE SPACE JULES COULD HOPE FOR 
BUT THE INTERIOR IS A LITTLE ON THE SMALL SIDE 
BUT JULES WOULD HAVE MONEY IN HER BUDGET 
TO ADAPT THAT OUTBUILDING AS IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
SO WE'VE GOT CRANMER COTTAGE 
NOW THIS WAS UM RIGHT AT THE TOP END OF MY BUDGET FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
THIS WOULD MEAN CHANGING THE BATHROOM AND THE KITCHEN 
BUT VERY PRETTY NONETHELESS I THINK THAT'S A MAYBE 
COLLEGE BARN COTTAGE I LOVE THIS ONE 
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS 
WE BOTH LOVED THAT ONE THAT'S A YES THEN DEFINITELY 
LET'S PUT THAT IN OUR YES PILE HERE 
THREE CROWNS COTTAGE UM I WOULD SAY A DEFINITE NO DEFINITE NO 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S DETACHED NO 
CHRISTMAS COTTAGE 
HMM 
IT'S A PRETTY COTTAGE FROM THE EXTERIOR THE OUTSIDE BUT FAR TOO MUCH LAND FOR YOU TO COPE WITH 
I QUITE LIKED THE LAND IT WAS OTHER THINGS THAT DIDN'T SPARK WITH ME 
O. K. SO WE'VE GOT A NO I THINK THOSE TWO ARE THE ONES 
THEY'RE MORE JULES THEY'RE JULIE COTTAGES 
O. K. SO CRANMER AND WE'VE GOT MY FAVOURITE COLLEGE BARN 
SO JULES HAS DECIDED ON THE TWO COTSWOLD COTTAGES SHE WANTS TO SEE FOR HERSELF 
AND TODAY THE COUNTRYSIDE IS LOOKING MORE CHRISTMAS CARD THAN CHOCOLATE BOX 
HELLO JULES LIZ NICE TO SEE YOU ON THIS LOVELY SNOWY MORNING 
I BROUGHT YOU TO THIS LITTLE LANE BECAUSE IT'S QUITE A GOOD WAY OF SEEING THE HOUSE FROM THE FRONT 
I THINK IT'S REALLY PRETTY REALLY LOVELY CHOCOLATE BOX ISN'T IT 
ANOTHER REASON FOR SHOWING YOU THIS WAY THIS IS A SHARED ACCESS BUT IT LEADS TO YOUR GARAGE 
YOU CAN SEE MY EYES LIGHT UP AT THAT 
BUT LET'S CARRY AND WE'RE GOING ROUND THE BACK LOVELY 
RIGHT SO THIS IS YOUR BACK GATE 
IT LEADS ONTO YOUR BACK GARDEN 
A LITTLE OVERLOOKED PERHAPS 
IT'S QUITE QUIET AT THE MOMENT 
I THINK THERE'S POSSIBILITIES WITH THIS AREA 
FOR TRELLIS WORK OR CLIMBING PLANTS TO MAKE IT MORE PRIVATE 
YES GOOD POINT THAT IS YOUR BACK DOOR SO LET'S HEAD ON INSIDE 
SO FOLLOW ME 
RIGHT SO THROUGH THE BACK DOOR 
IT'S A BIT DARK I'M THINKING THAT'S MY FIRST REACTION 
I THINK IT'S LOOKING A BIT TIRED I THINK IF YOU WHIP THE WHOLE THING OUT AND JUST EITHER PUT CREAM 
OR REALLY NICE TRADITIONAL HERITAGE COLOUR IN HERE 
BUT IT'S GOT A RAYBURN 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR LOVELY COUNTRY ROOM AND THE BEAUTIFUL FLAGSTONES 
THEY'RE NICE FLAGS 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE ROOM IT'S REALLY LIGHT AGAIN 
AGAIN IT'S QUITE OLD FASHIONED 
BUT IN TERMS OF SIZE AND IN TERMS OF SCOPE I THINK IT HAS GOT POTENTIAL IN HERE 
YES I THINK SO I LOVE THIS OLD BEAM THERE 
AND IT'S A LIGHT ROOM 
DARK CURTAINS BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU'D HAVE PERHAPS SOMETHING LIGHTER THAN THAT 
I THINK THE SITTING ROOM HERE IS REALLY GOOD SO FOLLOW ME 
THIS IS YOUR CENTRAL HALLWAY 
THAT'S THE MAIN FRONT DOOR AND THE LOO AT THE FAR END 
THAT'S GOOD THAT'S HANDY AND HERE IS THE SITTING ROOM

A GOOD EXPLORE AND WE'LL MEET UP LATER

NOT SURE ABOUT THE PINK IT'S A BIT CANDY COATED BUT NICE SIZE ROOM 
GOOD GRIEF YOU COULD PRACTICALLY DO AEROBICS ON THIS THING 
YOU COULD DO YOUR OLGA KORBUT 
YOU'RE A BIT OBSESSED WITH STORAGE 
IF EVERYBODY SAW UNDERNEATH YOUR BED THEY'LL KNOW THE REASON WHY

DELIGHTFUL WE SAY COTTAGE BUT IT'S REALLY SPACIOUS 
REALLY FELL IN LOVE WITH THAT LIVING ROOM QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO BE DONE 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE 
KEEP THOSE THOUGHTS IN MIND WE'LL HEAD OFF TO LOOK AT NUMBER TWO 
GREAT O. K. SO HERE WE ARE PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
SLIGHTLY FURTHER FROM THE STATION 
LIZ WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT A TWENTY MINUTE DRIVE EVERY DAY 
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO COMPROMISE AND MAYBE THIS WILL BE WORTH THE DRIVE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK FIRST IMPRESSIONS AGAIN VERY PRETTY 
LOVE THE STONE I LIKE IT FROM THE OUTSIDE 
DOES IT FIT INTO JULIE LAND 
IT'S GOT POTENTIAL LET'S SEE 
FOLLOW ME AND HAVE A LOOK AROUND 
RIGHT IN WE COME

VERY WELCOMING NICE AND TOASTY 
SO LET'S GO THIS WAY FIRST SHOW YOU THE KITCHEN 
VERY NICE HOUSE LOVELY LIZ'S FACE REALLY LIT UP YEAH 
IT'S WHAT I ENVISAGED FOR A COUNTRY COTTAGE 
THUMBS UP FROM MUM 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S MODERN WITHOUT BEING OVERLY MODERN AND QUITE COTTAGEY AS WELL 
I LIKE THE WHOLE BEAMED EFFECT THERE 
WITHOUT BEING PROBABLY TWEE OR OVERLY QUAINT 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FAIRLY FRESH FAIRLY NEW AS WELL 
WELL LET'S GO THROUGH THIS WAY BECAUSE THERE'S ONE OF YOUR BONUS POINTS IN THIS HOUSE 
OH THAT'S LOVELY IT'S A LOVELY ROOM ISN'T IT 
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A PLASTIC ADD ON WHICH YOU DIDN'T WANT 
NO I DEFINITELY DIDN'T WANT ONE OF THOSE IT'S NOT ME AT ALL 
THIS IS A REALLY REALLY PRETTY ROOM WITH LOTS OF LIGHT FLOODING THROUGH TO THE KITCHEN AS WELL 
SPACE FOR A TABLE I COULD SEE MYSELF JUST SAT THERE 
WE'VE GOT THE BACK DOOR TO THE GARDEN THERE I'LL LET YOU SEE THE GARDEN LATER 
LET'S LOOK AT THE SITTING ROOM 
RIGHT SO BACK ACROSS THE HALLWAY 
ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU'VE GOT YOUR SITTING ROOM 
I'M LIKING THIS ROOM I THINK IT'S UNUSUAL HOW YOU'VE GOT THE INLETS 
BUT THERE'S STILL QUITE A LOT OF FURNITURE IN HERE AS WELL 
I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S QUITE LIGHT YOU'VE GOT THE WINDOW SEAT HERE AGAIN AND THIS BEAUTIFUL STONE OH 
I PICTURE YOUR LEATHER SOFAS AND I THINK THEY'LL BE SUPER IN THIS ROOM 
KEEP THINKING YOU'VE GOT TO BEAR IT IN MIND AS A WHOLE HOUSE I KNOW 
WHAT'S THE WHOLE PACKAGE SO ON THAT THOUGHT HAVE A LOOK AT THE REST AND WE'LL GET TOGETHER LATER 
LOVELY THANK YOU 
BIRD SONG LISTEN TO THAT IT'S REALLY REALLY BEAUTIFUL YES 
IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS GARDEN 
BEAUTIFUL REALLY IS WOODS BEHIND 
ALL THE WILDLIFE ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS 
DIFFERENT WINDOWS TO DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE GARDEN 
YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING BETTER 
IT'S JUST A MANAGEABLE SIZE YOU'RE NOT OVERLOOKED IN ANY WAY IT'S JUST PRIVATE 
COULD IT DO WITH BEING A LITTLE BIT BIGGER NO 
DECOR'S REALLY TASTEFUL BEAUTIFUL 
IT'S A REALLY NICE COLOUR 
SYMPATHETIC WITH THE BATH AND WORKS WELL IN HERE WITH THE BEAMS 
IT'S JUST PERFECT 
I LIKE THE LIGHT FLOODING IN I LIKE THE LITTLE WINDOWS DOWN HERE 
HAVE YOU NOTICED ALL THE STONEWORK HERE FABULOUS 
REALLY LOVELY AND THE BEAMS ARE REALLY SUPER IN THIS HOUSE 
CAN YOU PICTURE THIS AS YOUR BEDROOM 
REALLY DEFINITELY IT'S REALLY WELCOMING 
IT'S VERY MUCH MY KIND OF ROOM IN FACT I'M READY TO JUMP INTO BED NOW 
SO HAVING SEEN BOTH PROPERTIES THAT YOU CHOSE THE BIG QUESTION IS WHICH DO YOU PREFER 
DEFINITELY THIS ONE 
I LOVE THE BEDROOMS THE BATHROOMS ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT THE REAL BIG SELLING POINT IS THE GARDEN 
IT'S A JULIE COTTAGE AND LOTS OF STORAGE AND LOTS OF STORAGE 
JULES I FELT YOU WERE FIGHTING WITH THE THINGS YOU LIKED ABOUT THE FIRST COTTAGE I DEFINITELY WAS 
THE FIRST COTTAGE I REALLY LIKED THAT BIG ROOM AND THE FIRE WAS JUST SO INVITING REALLY COSY 
DID YOU GET GOOSE BUMPS IN HERE 
I'VE GOT THEM NOW 
SO DO YOU LIKE IT ENOUGH TO PUT AN OFFER IN YES VERY MUCH SO 
SO WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP PUT MY FLAT ON THE MARKET IN HAMPSTEAD 
I THINK WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS GET ACROSS TO YOUR SELLING AGENT THAT 
YOU FOUND SOMETHING YOU REALLY LIKE 
RIGHT THE CRUCIAL THING IS TO GET YOUR FLAT UNDER OFFER 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE OWNERS HAVE ALREADY DECIDED THEY'RE GONNA GO INTO RENTED ACCOMMODATION 
FABULOUS SO NO UPWARD CHAIN HERE 
SO IT COULD ALL GO REALLY WELL IT COULD ALL COME TOGETHER NICELY 
SO I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK I HOPE YOU GET IT SO DO I 
UNFORTUNATELY JULES WAS BEATEN TO COLLEGE BARN BY A CHAIN FREE BUYER WHO PUT IN A CASH OFFER 
BUT SHE'S NOT GIVING UP THAT EASILY 
WITH HER SALE IMMINENT SHE PLANS TO GO BACK 
TO THE OWNER OF COLLEGE BARN WITH AN EVEN HIGHER OFFER 
AND IF THAT FAILS I'M SURE IT WOULDN'T BE LONG BEFORE JULES 
FINDS HER VERY OWN CHOCOLATE BOX COTTAGE IN THE COTSWOLDS
