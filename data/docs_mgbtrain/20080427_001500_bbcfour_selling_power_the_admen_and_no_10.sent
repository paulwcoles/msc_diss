THEIR JOB IS TO SELL ASPIRATION AND TO PERSUADE US 
WHICH SOAP POWDER TO USE WHAT WE SHOULD DRINK WEAR AND DRIVE 
BUT HOW DO THEY SELL PROBABLY THE MOST UNDESIRABLE PRODUCT IN THE WORLD POLITICIANS 
IN PURSUIT OF POWER THE POLITICAL PARTIES SPEND MILLIONS TRYING TO WIN OUR VOTES 
AND THEY EMPLOY SOME OF THE MOST CREATIVE PEOPLE IN BRITAIN TO DO IT AD MEN 
I DON'T INTEND TO END THIS CAMPAIGN PACKAGED LIKE CORNFLAKES 
THIS IS THE STORY OF THE METHODS USED 
THE MEMORABLE SLOGAN 
WE TEND TO FOLLOW CHURCHILL'S AXIOM 
THE ONLY ORIGINAL REMARK IS SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN SAID FOR A LONG TIME 
HOW THEY PACKAGE THE LEADER 
THE KNOCKING COPY 
YOU GO FOR THE ACHILLES HEEL OF THE OPPOSITION IS WHAT YOU TRY AND DO 
AND HOW SOMETIMES THEY JUST GO THAT LITTLE BIT TOO FAR 
A GENERAL ELECTION IS IMMINENT 
AND YOUR ADVERTISING AGENCY HAS WON THE GOVERNING PARTY'S ACCOUNT 
YOUR BRIEF TO ENSURE THEY GET BACK INTO NUMBER TEN 
AS AD MEN YOU CAN DECIDE TO HOW TO SELL POWER 
YOU CAN SELL THE PARTY SELL THE LEADER EVEN SELL INDIVIDUAL POLICIES 
BUT FIRST YOU MUST WRITE A CATCHY SLOGAN 
TO APPEAR THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN 
ENCAPSULATING IN A LINE WHY SOMEONE SHOULD VOTE FOR YOUR PARTY 
BRITAIN IS GOING BACKWARDS' 
THAT SLOGAN MUST BE CENTRED ON CHANGE 
GOOD OR BAD 
MAKING US FEARFUL OR HOPEFUL 
ASKING US TO STICK WITH WHAT WE HAVE OR TRY SOMETHING NEW 
TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THAN TODAY 
IT'S ALMOST INEVITABLE THAT IF YOU'RE THE OPPOSITION YOU HAVE TO SAY TO PEOPLE 
IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE BECAUSE YOU'RE ASKING THEM TO MAKE A CHANGE 
AND IF YOU'RE THE GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE TO SAY TO PEOPLE 
DON'T MAKE A CHANGE 
OR THERE'S NO NEED TO MAKE A CHANGE BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT CHANGE 
THE FUNDAMENTAL THING IS EVERYTHING'S GREAT 
DON'T TAKE THE RISK ON THE OTHER LOT 
WHEN YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION IT'S EVERYTHING IS DREADFUL 
IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE 
AT ITS MOST FUNDAMENTAL THOSE ARE THE TWO STRATEGIES 
THE SLOGAN EMERGED IN THE FIFTIES 
WHEN POLITICAL ADVERTISING WAS TAKING A QUANTUM LEAP FORWARDS 
THE CONSERVATIVES HIRED A TRENDSETTING AGENCY 
COLEMAN PRENTICE AND VARLEY COLEMAN PRENTICE AND VARLEY 
TO MASTERMIND THEIR FUTURE ELECTION ADVERTISING 
AFTER THEIR SHOCK DEFEAT IN THE NINETEEN FORTY FIVE BALLOT 
CPV WERE CELEBRATED FOR PROMOTING THE FASHION HOUSES JAEGER AND ELIZABETH ARDEN 
CPV WAS A VERY CONSERVATIVE AGENCY 
IT HAD EX GOVERNMENT MINISTERS ON ITS BOARD 
IT WORKED FOR WHAT WAS THEN CALLED THE WAR HOUSE THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 
THE AGENCY WAS IN ANY CASE 
THE MOST FAMOUS BRITISH AGENCY IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES 
IT'S GONE NOW SADLY 
IT WAS THE VERY EARLY DAYS OF COMMUNICATION 
THE COLONEL AS HE WAS KNOWN 
IT WAS A DIFFERENT GENTLEMANLY ERA 
THE AGENCY USED PIONEERING MARKET RESEARCH 
TO IDENTIFY A NEW TYPE OF CONSERVATIVE VOTER FOR HAROLD MACMILLAN'S ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS TORY 
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR 
CONSERVATIVES AS USUAL WHY USUAL 
I THINK THEY'RE THE BEST PARTY FOR ONE THING 
AND THEY'RE DEFINITELY THE BEST IN EVERY WAY I THINK 
THEY TARGETED THE HOUSEWIFE AND CLERICAL WORKER IN A SERIES OF INNOVATIVE ADS 
THE PARTY BUILT A WAR CHEST JUST FOR ELECTION ADVERTS 
AND SPENT THE EQUIVALENT OF EIGHT MILLION ON THE CAMPAIGN 
AND THE AGENCY CAME UP WITH THE DEFINING SLOGAN FOR TORY ELECTIONS 
LIFE'S BETTER WITH THE CONSERVATIVES 
DON'T LET LABOUR RUIN IT 
DON'T LET LABOUR RUIN IT 
IS ONE OF THE BASIC CORE STRATEGIES OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATION 
THE OTHER ONE IS TIME FOR A CHANGE 
AND CPV AS THEY WERE KNOWN DID VERY WELL WITH THAT STRATEGY FOR MANY YEARS 
WHEN THEY SAY DON'T LET LABOUR RUIN IT 
I SAY TO THEM BRITAIN CAN BE BETTER THAN THIS 
WHATEVER THE SLOGAN IT NEEDS TO REGISTER WITH THE VOTER 
I THINK THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HAVE DONE A FAIR JOB YOU KNOW 
BUT ER TIME FOR A CHANGE 
WHEN MACMILLAN WON A LANDSLIDE SOME IN THE LABOUR PARTY 
SAID IT WAS IMMORAL FOR THE TORIES TO RELY ON THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS 
TO HELP WIN POWER 
BUT WHEN HAROLD WILSON TOOK OVER AS LABOUR LEADER IN THE EARLY SIXTIES 
HE DECIDED IT WAS TIME FOR A CHANGE AND EMPLOYED A HANDFUL OF PROFESSIONAL AD MEN 
TO PROMOTE THE PARTY BUT ALL WERE UNPAID VOLUNTEERS 
I WAS WORKING FOR AN ADVERTISING AGENCY 
AND SOME OF THE VERY LARGE ACCOUNTS THAT THERE WERE IN THE WORLD 
LIKE PROCTOR AND AMP GAMBLE AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT 
IS IT ANY GOOD I'LL SAY IT IS YES GRANDMA 
DID I ASK YOU LESLEY NO GRANDMA 
WE GIRLS DON'T NEED YOUR HELP 
I WAS AN ODD PERSON IN THAT I WAS BOTH POLITICALLY MOTIVATED 
BUT ALSO I HAD BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME IN BUILDING UP A REPUTATION IN THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY 
AND THERE WEREN'T MANY OF US AT THAT TIME 
IT WAS A NEW ERA IN A WAY FOR THE PARTY AND HAROLD 
WHEN I MADE MY FIRST PRESENTATION TO HIM 
TEASED ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FACT THAT 
OH I SEE YOU'VE GOT THOSE CHART SETS WHAT AD MEN DO 
DAVID KINGSLEY PITCHED A SUITABLY SIXTIES VERSION OF TIME FOR A CHANGE 
CALLED LET'S GO WITH LABOUR 
BUT WILSON NEEDED SOME PERSUASION AS HE'D SPOTTED A DOUBLE ENTENDRE 
LET'S GO WITH LABOUR WAS PART OF WHAT WE WERE PROPOSING 
AND HAROLD INTERVENED AND SAID WELL UP WHERE I COME FROM IN THE NORTH 
BEING ON THE GO MEANS BEING ON THE PO HA HA YOU SEE 
DESPITE THE LAVATORIAL CONNOTATION IT PROVED A WINNING TAGLINE 
IN THE NEXT ELECTION LABOUR'S AD MEN CAME UP WITH A NEW ONE 
UNDERLINING THE WORD KNOW 
IT WAS REALLY SAYING TO THE PUBLIC DO YOU OR DON'T YOU TRUST 
THE LABOUR PARTY AS THE GOVERNMENT 
NOT EVERYONE LIKED IT OR WILSON TAKE A LOOK THAT POSTER 
THE ONE WITH THE UGLY FACE 
AND IT WAS NOT IT WAS NOT HARD FOR EDWARD HEATH'S CONSERVATIVE PARTY TO OFFER SOMETHING BETTER 
MR. EDWARD HEATH THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER 
WELCOME TO THE FIRST EDITION OF A BETTER TOMORROW 
THEY'VE GIVEN US PLENTY OF WORDS TO TAKE THEM AT 
LET'S LOOK AT A FEW OF THEM 
WE WERE TOLD YOU KNOW LABOUR GOVERNMENT WORKS 
LABOUR'S LOSING SLOGANS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY 
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT AREN'T THEIR IDEALS YOURS AS WELL 
AND LABOUR'S GOT LIFE AND SOUL 
SPIT IT OUT OF COURSE I'M NOT GOING TO SPIT IT OUT 
FOR MRS. THATCHER'S FIRST ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
THE AD MEN DEVISED VARIATIONS ON THEIR TRIED AND TESTED THEME 
OUR GENERAL MESSAGE WAS LIFE WILL BE BETTER WITH THE CONSERVATIVES 
THE OVERRIDING SLOGAN WAS TIME FOR A CHANGE 
WHICH WAS THE POINT WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE 
WE HAD ANOTHER ONE WHICH I ALWAYS LOVED WHICH WAS DON'T JUST HOPE FOR A BETTER LIFE VOTE FOR IT 
THE REASON THEY GET AD MEN TO REITERATE THESE VERY FAMILIAR THEMES 
IS THAT THEY CAN MAKE IT FRESHER PERHAPS 
IF YOU'RE LUCKY 
AND MAKE IT MORE RELEVANT TO THE CHANGING VERNACULAR 
OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND 
BUT GENERALLY IT IS TRUE THEY HIRE THESE AD MEN TO SAY THE SAME THING 
WHILE FIGHTING HER THIRD CAMPAIGN AS LEADER MARGARET THATCHER WAS SAID TO BE DELIGHTED 
WITH THE REGURGITATED TORY SLOGAN BRITAIN IS GREAT AGAIN DON'T LET LABOUR WRECK IT 
WE TEND TO FOLLOW CHURCHILL'S AXIOM 
THE ONLY ORIGINAL REMARK IS SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN SAID FOR A LONG TIME 
TEN YEARS LATER JOHN MAJOR'S AD MEN TRIED TO EXCITE THE VOTER 
WITH YET ANOTHER VERSION OF THEIR OLD CATCH LINE 
BRITAIN IS BOOMING DON'T LET LABOUR BLOW IT 
HE LOST THE ELECTION 
WHEN IN POWER NEW LABOUR HAD SOMETHING SIMILAR 
BRITAIN IS WORKING DON'T LET THE TORIES TAKE US BACK 
FOR THEIR GLITZY NEW EMPLOYMENT CAMPAIGN 
SOMETIMES A SLOGAN DOES REINFORCE PREJUDICES 
OR BELIEFS THAT YOU WISH TO REINFORCE 
BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT SERVES A SIMILAR FUNCTION TO A FULL STOP 
FOR AD MEN THE SLOGAN IS PERHAPS NOT THE MOST CREATIVE CONTRIBUTION TO SELLING POWER 
FOR REAL IMPACT YOU MIGHT SOMETIMES NEED SOMETHING ELSE 
BUT IN AN INDUSTRY THAT'S HIGHLY REGULATED AMAZINGLY 
POLITICAL ADVERTS AREN'T REQUIRED TO BE HONEST DECENT OR TRUE 
ALLOWING YOU TO KNOCK THE OPPOSITION AND SAY PRETTY MUCH WHATEVER YOU LIKE 
HOW HAVE WE GOT INTO THIS STATE 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY LABOUR'S PRIME MINISTER HAROLD WILSON WAS FACING HIS THIRD ELECTION 
WE'RE ON THE ATTACK IN THIS ELECTION AS YOU KNOW 
THE AD MEN NEEDED TO STOP THE FICKLE ELECTORATE VOTING FOR A CHANGE 
THEY HAD TO MAKE THE TORIES LOOK AS UNATTRACTIVE A PROPOSITION AS POSSIBLE 
LABOUR'S AD MAN DAVID KINGSLEY HAD A REVOLUTIONARY IDEA 
AND DEVISED A SERIES OF PHRASES TO BE THE BASIS OF THEIR STRATEGY 
HE PITCHED IT TO THE PARTY 
GO ON THE OFFENSIVE BY BEING OFFENSIVE 
WE MIGHT USE SUCH PHRASES AS THEY'RE THE WIZARDS THAT WEREN'T 
SHEEP IN WOLVES' CLOTHING 
THERE'S NOTHING AS STALE AS YESTERDAY'S MEN 
LOOK BACK IN ANGUISH 
I THINK THIS IS WHERE YESTERDAY'S MEN WAS BORN 
AND EVENTUALLY BECAME THE WAY THAT WE DID IT WHEN WE GOT TO THE ELECTION 
PORTRAYING THE OPPOSITION AS FAILED HAS BEENS 
KINGSLEY COMMISSIONED CLAY MODELS OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY FRONT BENCH 
TO BE USED IN A GROUNDBREAKING ADVERTISEMENT 
SIR ALEC DOUGLAS HOME EDWARD HEATH ENOCH POWELL 
ALL NAMES THAT WERE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AT THAT TIME 
THE CARICATURES APPEARED ON BILLBOARDS AROUND THE COUNTRY 
UNDER THE DEROGATORY TITLE YESTERDAY'S MEN 
IT WAS THE OPENING SHOT IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
BUT SOME FELT IT JUST WASN'T BRITISH AND WAS A BIT BELOW THE BELT 
THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTCRY PARTICULARLY FROM THE OPPOSITION PRESS 
ON THEIR FRONT PAGES ACCUSING US OF BEING RUDE ABOUT OTHER POLITICIANS 
WELL THAT WAS ANOTHER TIME WASN'T IT TODAY IT'S COMMON PRACTICE 
BUT WE DIDN'T THINK WE WERE DOING THAT 
WE WERE JUST REMINDING PEOPLE OF WHO THE ALTERNATIVE PEOPLE WERE 
THE ADS WERE SOON PULLED BUT THE DAMAGE WAS DONE 
I REMEMBER SEEING YESTERDAY'S MEN AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A CONSERVATIVE 
I'VE BEEN A CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE 
BUT I THOUGHT THAT ONE GOT IN BETWEEN THE RIBS 
IT SHOWS THE VALUE OF THESE SORTS OF POSTERS IN SETTING AN AGENDA 
IT HELPS SHAPE THE OPINION FORMERS THE JOURNALISTS 
IT LINES UP THE ATTACK 
IT IS A FOCUSING DEVICE TO FOCUS COMMUNICATION ON THE SAME TARGET 
WHEN WILSON LOST THAT ELECTION YESTERDAY'S MEN 
WAS CITED AS PARTLY RESPONSIBLE 
CERTAINLY PEOPLE WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY ALL SAY THAT HAROLD WILSON 
PUT A LOT OF BLAME ON THE ADVERTISEMENT 
AND IT WAS LESS THAN GENEROUS TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BROUGHT IT ABOUT 
THE MAKERS OF PEPSI ADS WERE THE PRODUCTION COMPANY WHO CAME TO THE AID OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
I THINK WE'VE STRUCK OIL HERE PHYLLIS 
THE TORY LEADER EDWARD HEATH WANTED TO PROJECT A CLEAN WHOLESOME IMAGE 
WHAT'S HE SAYING PHYLLIS HE'S GETTING A BIT PASSIONATE 
HE SAYS YOU OWE HIM TWENTY PESETAS FOR THE PEPSI 
JEREMY SCOTT WAS THE MAN OF THE MOMENT AND WORKED ON THEIR ELECTION FILMS 
WE SUGGESTED AN ARMOURY OF NEGATIVES 
WHICH WOULD DESTROY THE ENEMY POSITIONS 
BUT HEATH VETOED IT UTTERLY 
HE SAID NO DIRTY TRICKS NO SLEAZE 
HE WANTED THE MORAL HIGH GROUND 
HOWEVER WE PRODUCED A HOST OF NEGATIVES 
AND THE MORAL HIGH GROUND WASN'T WHAT HE GOT 
DO YOU RECOGNISE THIS 
IT A FROZEN WAGE PACKET 
MR. WILSON PUT IT ON THE MARKET IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX 
VOTE LABOUR ON JUNE EIGHTEENTH AND YOU'LL GET IT AGAIN 
IN THE FAMILY SIZE 
THE TONE OF THE INDIVIDUAL COMMERCIALS WAS AS NEGATIVE AS YOU COULD GET 
SINCE MR. WILSON CAME TO POWER THIS IS WHAT HE'S DONE TO YOUR POUND 
ONE WAS A PAIR OF SCISSORS SNIPPING UP A TREASURY NOTE 
TO SHOW HOW RAPIDLY THE VALUE OF THE POUND WAS DETERIORATING 
'.ZERO POINT ONE NINE SEVEN FOUR ELEVEN SHILLINGS 
NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE TEN SHILLINGS 
THE TEN BOB POUND 
ONLY YOUR VOTE CAN STOP HIM 
EDWARD HEATH'S VICTORY PROVED THAT NEGATIVE ADVERTISING ON THE RIGHT ISSUES COULD BE A VOTE WINNER 
BUT KNOCKING THE OPPOSITION'S POLICIES WASN'T NEW 
IN THE LATE NINETEEN TWENTIES THE CONSERVATIVES MADE THEIR FIRST POLITICAL ADS FOR A NEW MEDIUM FILM 
ONE ATTACKED LABOUR FOR BEING THE PARTY OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT 
AND INCREASED TAXATION CONSTANTLY POPULAR THEMES IN THEIR ELECTION CAMPAIGNS 
POLITICAL ADVERTISING IS ABSOLUTELY IN THE TRADITION OF PROPAGANDA 
THERE'S NOT A HUGE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN PROPAGANDA AND POLITICAL ADVERTISING 
AND THERE'S NOT A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POLITICAL PERSUASIVE DEVICES 
FROM WHATEVER PART OF THE SPECTRUM LEFT OR RIGHT THEY COME 
DENIGRATING YOUR OPPONENT CAN BE A POWERFUL PERSUADER SHOWING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PARTIES 
BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM 
MOVIE THEATRES WERE NOT KEEN ON TAKING POLITICAL PROPAGANDA 
SO THEY GOT THE IDEA OF SENDING ROUND MOBILE VANS CINEMA VANS 
WHERE THEY WOULD SHOW THEIR FILMS 
GOING NEGATIVE MIGHT EVEN HAVE HELPED STANLEY BALDWIN TO WIN POWER IN NINETEEN THIRTY ONE 
THEY WOULD GO TO THE SEASIDE 
OR PARTICULAR TOWNS THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WANTED TO TARGET 
THEY WOULD SET UP THEY WOULD HAVE A CANOPY OVER THEM 
THEY WOULD START SHOWING FILMS AND THEY WOULD TRY AND ATTRACT A CROWD 
THAT'S BASICALLY HOW THEY WORKED THEY WERE VERY IMPRESSED WITH THEIR OWN SUCCESS 
THEY WERE A NOVELTY OF COURSE BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE WAS DOING THIS AND CINEMA WAS STILL PRETTY NEW 
THE CINEMA AD WAS REVIVED FIFTY YEARS LATER 
BY LONDON'S MOST FASHIONABLE AD AGENCY SAATCHI AND AMP SAATCHI 
TELL YOU WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE WHAT'S THAT 
LABOUR IN POWER AGAIN 
LABOUR IN POWER WAS THAT THE MARX BROTHERS 
NO ANOTHER BUNCH OF COMEDIANS 
IT WAS THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
THE COUNTRY WAS FALLING APART 
LABOUR HAD BEEN IN POWER FOR FOUR YEARS AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAD RISEN TO ALMOST FIFTEEN MILLION 
THEY'RE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE UNEMPLOYED 
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE BLOODY SUFFERING 
COME AND MEET US EH 
THE SAATCHIS WERE TWO BROTHERS WITH A REPUTATION FOR HIGHLY IMAGINATIVE CAMPAIGNS 
INCLUDING A NUMBER OF AMUSING PUBLIC HEATH ADS 
WITH THIRTY LAPS TO GO COME ALONG DARLING WALKIES 
COME ON COME ALONG ROGER 
IT MAY COME AS A NASTY SHOCK 
BUT PEOPLE NEED EXERCISING JUST AS MUCH AS DOGS' 
THEY HAD DONE SOME WONDERFUL WORK FOR THE HEALTH EDUCATION COUNCIL 
AND THEY DID THESE GREAT ADS AGAINST SMOKING 
THEY DID ADS ABOUT DISEASE THEY SHOWED THEY COULD DO COMMUNICATION ON PUBLIC INTEREST TOPICS 
HANG ON HERE 
AWAY YOU GO 
YOU'LL PUT MORE EFFORT INTO EVERYTHING YOU DO 
THESE ADS IMPRESSED THE CONSERVATIVES AND THEIR FIRST WOMAN LEADER MARGARET THATCHER 
SO THE SAATCHIS WERE HIRED TO BRING THEIR FLAIR AND IMAGINATION TO HER ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
A FEW MINUTES' EXERCISE EVERY DAY COULD ADD SO MUCH TO YOUR LIFE 
MAURICE SAATCHI WROTE MOST OF THE STRATEGY AND CHARLES SAATCHI OVERSAW ALL THE CREATIVE WORK 
CHARLES IS THE GENIUS MAURICE IS THE INTERPRETER OF HIS GENIUS 
THEY LOVE POLITICAL ADVERTISING 
THEY TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME 
WE ALL DO WE'RE ALL OBSESSED WITH IT 
SAATCHI AND SAATCHI DIDN'T DISAPPOINT 
THEY CREATED ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE NEGATIVE POLITICAL ADS EVER MADE 
LABOUR ISN'T WORKING WAS A CLEVER WORD PLAY 
HIGHLIGHTING THE GROWING RANKS OF THOSE ON THE DOLE 
AND THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE LABOUR PARTY 
POSTERS STARTED APPEARING IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT 
MRS. THATCHER THOUGHT 
THAT IT WAS RATHER RISKY TO PUT THE WORD LABOUR IN THE HEADLINE 
BECAUSE IT WOULD PROMOTE THE OTHER SIDE 
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO EXPLAIN TO HER IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT 
I THINK SHE GOT IT IN THE END 
IT CAPTURED THE IMAGINATION BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THOUGHTS 
THAT JUST TOUCHES PEOPLE AND MAKES PEOPLE SAY THAT RINGS TRUE TO ME 
IT SPREAD DISCONTENT AND IT SUGGESTED TIME FOR CHANGE 
WE DIDN'T SAY LET'S DO NEGATIVE ADVERTISING 
WE JUST DID WHAT WAS THE MOST THOUGHT PROVOKING STIRRING STUFF 
LABOUR HAD BEEN IN OFFICE FOR A WEE WHILE 
SO INEVITABLY TO MAKE THE CASE FOR YOUR OWN PARTY 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE HIGHLIGHTING 
OR POINTING TO THE INADEQUACIES OF THE GOVERNMENT 
THE ACCEPTED WISDOM IS THAT NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING IS WHAT WORKS 
WHAT HAS THE GREATEST EFFECT 
IT'S CERTAINLY EASIER IT'S EASIER TO WRITE 
ALL THE FAMOUS PIECES OF COMMUNICATION 
I THINK IT'S TRUE TO SAY HAVE BEEN KNOCKING COPY AS WE CALL IT 
LISTEN TO THE NEWS READ YOUR TABLOID PRESS READ ANY PRESS 
WHY ARE NEWSPAPERS 
NOT FULL OF EVERYTHING THAT'S GONE RIGHT THAT DAY 
PEOPLE AREN'T INTERESTED IN HEARING IT 
IF YOU THINK THAT THE COMPETITION IS FOR THE UNDECIDED VOTER 
THAT IS THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE COMPETITION IN AN ELECTION 
AND A NEGATIVE AD REMINDS YOU 
AND REINFORCES THE VIEW THAT IS PRE EXISTING 
THAT PERHAPS THESE PEOPLE AREN'T AS GOOD AS THEY'D LIKE YOU TO BELIEVE 
THEN YOU'LL THINK 
YES I WAS DITHERING BUT I'M GOING TO GO THAT WAY 
AND THAT'S THE RATHER SIMPLE WAY 
THAT NEGATIVE ADVERTISING IS SUPPOSED TO WORK 
AND FREQUENTLY DOES WORK 
THE NEGATIVE AD CAN FUEL CONTROVERSY AND MAKE AN IMPACT 
AND LABOUR ISN'T WORKING CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED IN RATTLING ITS TARGET 
THE SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT 
THE GREAT JOY OF IT WAS THAT WE DIDN'T SPEND MUCH MONEY ON IT BUT LABOUR TOOK EXCEPTION TO IT 
IN PARTICULAR DENIS HEALEY CRITICISED IT 
IT ISN'T SURPRISING WHEN YOU COME TO THINK OF IT 
THAT SHE'S CHOSEN SAATCHI AND AMP SAATCHI THE SPECIALISTS IN DEODORANTS AND DETERGENTS 
TO CLEANSE AND SWEETEN THE IMAGE OF EXTREMISM AND DIVISION 
WHICH SHE'S CREATED BY ALL SHE'S SAID AND DONE 
IT WAS TYPICAL OF THE LABOUR PARTY AT THE TIME 
WHO HAVE ALWAYS IN THEIR HEARTS BELIEVED THAT ADVERTISING MEN AND MARKETING MEN 
ARE SOME KIND OF SONS OF THE DEVIL 
WHO MAKE PEOPLE DO THINGS THEY DON'T WANT TO DO AND DISTORT SOCIETY 
BUT LABOUR ISN'T WORKING 
IS THOUGHT TO HAVE AFFECTED THE COURSE OF BRITISH POLITICAL HISTORY 
IT'S HARD TO PROVE THIS BEYOND ALL DOUBT 
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR 
TO JAMES CALLAGHAN NOT CALLING AN ELECTION THAT AUTUMN 
WHICH ALMOST CERTAINLY HELPED BRING ABOUT HIS PRETTY HEAVY DEFEAT THE FOLLOWING YEAR 
CALLAGHAN'S DEFEAT LOOKED INEVITABLE AFTER A WINTER OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION CRIPPLED BRITAIN 
EXCUSE ME IS THIS THE QUEUE FOR THE FIFTY P. STALLS 
OH NO THIS IS THE QUEUE FOR SERIOUS OPERATIONS 
AND THATCHER GAVE SAATCHI'S A FREE REIGN TO CAPITALISE ON THE CHAOS 
SHE TRUSTED THEM TO FIND THE MOST POWERFUL TECHNIQUES TO HELP HER WIN THE ELECTION 
ASKING YOU TO HELP US IN THIS THE MOST CRUCIAL ELECTION 
FOR PUTTING BRITAIN ON A DIFFERENT ROAD 
THE HIGH PROFILE AND LARGELY NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN 
CONTRIBUTED TO HER SUCCESS AND MADE SAATCHI'S A HOUSEHOLD NAME 
IT WAS THEIR SPRINGBOARD TO BECOME THE BIGGEST AD AGENCY IN BRITAIN 
BRITAIN'S FIRST FEMALE P. M. SWEPT INTO NUMBER TEN 
TAKING SAATCHI'S WITH HER 
I THINK PEOPLE SAW THAT COMBATIVE CHALLENGING ADVERTISING COULD WORK 
WE'VE SINCE LEARNT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT IT 
AND MOST COMPARATIVE ADVERTISING ISN'T EFFECTIVE 
BUT PEOPLE FELT THAT THIS WAS BEING BOLD 
THIS WAS BEING CHALLENGING LET'S DO IT FOR OUR BRAND 
IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES THE CONSERVATIVES WEREN'T WORKING 
RIOTING ERUPTED IN BRITAIN'S INNER CITIES 
HUNDREDS OF FACTORIES CLOSED AND BY NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE UNEMPLOYMENT ROSE TO OVER THREE MILLION 
WITH THE GENERAL ELECTION UNDER WAY LABOUR'S NEW LEADER MICHAEL FOOT HAD YET TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION 
MICHAEL FOOT IS THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY 
MICHAEL FOOT SPEAKS FOR THE LABOUR PARTY AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE MANIFESTO POLICY 
WHY WAS IT NECESSARY IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN TO BE CLEAR WHO THE LEADER IS 
HE WANTED TO WIN ON A RADICAL SOCIALIST ELECTION MANIFESTO 
AND THE TORY AD MEN SEIZED ON IT 
THE SAATCHIS HAD A TALENT FOR IDENTIFYING AND EXPLOITING 
THEIR OPPONENT'S ACHILLES HEEL 
AND SUGGESTED THAT A VOTE FOR LABOUR WAS A VOTE FOR EXTREMISM 
THE REMARKABLE THING WAS IF YOU LOOKED AT WHAT THEY STOOD FOR 
AND WHAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY STOOD FOR 
THERE WAS HARDLY ANY GAP BETWEEN THE TWO 
SO WE DECIDED 
WOULDN'T IT BE INTERESTING TO DO AN AD COMPARING THE TWO THINGS 
SO THEN WE CAME UP WITH THIS HEADLINE WHICH JUST SAID LIKE YOUR MANIFESTO COMRADE 
AND WE HAD THESE TWO IDENTICAL LOOKING MANIFESTOS AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE 
SO IT WAS JUST A VERY SIMPLE TYPICAL US KIND OF AD REALLY 
THEY'VE DONE BRILLIANTLY NEGATIVE ADS 
WHERE THEY SPOT WHERE THE WEAKNESS IS 
AND EXAGGERATE IT AND AMUSE PEOPLE WITH IT AND IT WORKS I THINK 
UNLIKE MARGARET THATCHER MICHAEL FOOT DIDN'T BELIEVE IN IMAGE CREATION OR MANAGING THE MEDIA 
BUT EVEN HE REALISED THAT TO GET INTO NUMBER TEN HE NEEDED THE AD MEN'S HELP 
BIRD'S ANGEL DELIGHT 
YOU'LL BE SURPRISED JUST HOW DELICIOUSLY LIGHT IT IS' 
TO IMPROVE THEIR LACKLUSTRE IMAGE THEY RECRUITED THE MEN BEHIND ANGEL DELIGHT 
BIRD'S ANGEL DELIGHT 
IT'S DELICIOUSLY LIGHT 
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN ITS HISTORY THAT LABOUR PAID PROFESSIONAL AD MEN 
SPENDING THE EQUIVALENT OF ALMOST TWO MILLION IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
JOHNNY WRIGHT WON THE ACCOUNT FOR HIS COMPANY 
BUT NOT EVERYONE IN THE PARTY WAS HAPPY TO BECOME A BRAND 
WE HAD THE ABSOLUTE HATERS WHO HATED US WITH A PASSION 
THAT WAS PRETTY RARE REALLY IN BUSINESS 
AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE CAUTIOUS UM 
AND EXPECTED THAT WE COULD WAVE SOME MAGIC WAND AND DO SOMETHING MAGICAL 
WRIGHT'S AGENCY WERE ASKED TO PRODUCE FIVE TEN MINUTE ELECTION BROADCASTS 
AND HALF A DOZEN POSTERS AND PRESS ADS IN LESS THAN A MONTH 
SOME POLITICIANS ASKED TO FRONT THE CAMPAIGN HAD DIFFICULTY 
THINK POSITIVE VOTE POSITIVE OH 
IT'S SUCH A BLOODY STUPID THING TO SAY ISN'T IT 
THINK POSITIVE ACT POSITIVE VOTE LABOUR I'M SORRY BUT IT IS 
IT DOESN'T COME OFF THE TONGUE NICELY 
THINK POSITIVE ACT POSITIVE VOTE LABOUR 
READY TAKE THREE 
LABOUR WERE FIFTEEN POINTS ADRIFT IN THE POLLS 
EVERY MORNING JOHNNY WRIGHT WOULD MEET WITH CAMPAIGN MANAGERS 
AT LABOUR H. Q. TO DISCUSS WHAT THEY WOULD DO 
SOMEBODY WOULD SAY WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE HEALTH SERVICE 
AND THAT WAS RECKONED TO BE OUR BRIEF 
SO I WENT BACK TO THE AGENCY WHICH WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN TWENTY MINUTES AWAY 
IN MY EXTREMELY OLD MINI AND SAID 
IT'S THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE LADS 
AND WE'D DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE 
DESPITE THE POSITIVE SLOGAN LABOUR'S ADVERTISING WAS REASSURINGLY NEGATIVE 
IT SHOWED LIFE UNDER THE TORIES GUTTERS FULL OF THE UNEMPLOYED 
PENSIONERS UNDER THE SCREW 
YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE SCRAPHEAP 
WE DEVELOPED A SORT OF GRUESOME NEGATIVE TO DO WITH THE HEALTH SERVICE OR SCHOOL LEAVERS 
BIG VISUAL HEADLINE AND THEN A BIT OF EXPLANATORY COPY 
ABOUT WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT LABOUR WAS GOING TO DO TO RELIEVE THIS PROBLEM 
MICHAEL FOOT PROMISES HE WILL BRING DOWN UNEMPLOYMENT 
MEANWHILE SAATCHI AND AMP SAATCHI WERE WORKING OVERTIME 
TO REMIND THE VOTERS QUITE HOW DREADFUL LIFE UNDER LABOUR WOULD BE 
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEFORE THE LAST ELECTION 
WHAT IT WAS LIKE AT THE BEGINNING OF SEVENTY NINE 
THE RUBBISH PILED HIGH IN THE STREETS 
AMBULANCES LEFT UNMANNED 
THE DEAD UNBURIED 
LABOUR'S AD AGENCY JOHNNY WRIGHT AND PARTNERS WANTED TO RESPOND WITH 
A DEVASTATING AND HIGHLY PERSONAL ATTACK 
LIKENING MARGARET THATCHER TO THE GANGSTER IN THE SONG MAC THE KNIFE 
WE PRODUCED WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS FANTASTIC AGGRESSIVE 
ANTI THATCHER ADVERTISING THAT THE WORLD WOULD TALK ABOUT 
BIG STRONG VISUAL STRONG HEADLINE BIT OF A PUN BRITONS LIKE PUNS 
THEN SOME UNARGUABLE COPY POINTS 
SHE'S SLASHED THE JOBS OF TWO MILLION THOUSAND PEOPLE 
SHE'S FILLETED BRITISH INDUSTRY 
SHE'S KNIFED US IN THE REGIONS 
YOU'D HAVE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FORCED TO SEE IT BECAUSE IT WOULD'VE BEEN ON TELEVISION 
THE LABOUR PARTY ABSOLUTELY WITHDREW FROM IT 
AND THOUGHT NO NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT NO AND IT NEVER RAN 
THE ELECTION RESULT WAS NEVER IN DOUBT 
THE CONSERVATIVES' SLICK CAMPAIGN RAN RINGS AROUND THE OPPOSITION 
AS IT HAPPENS HALF THE ADVERTISING WAS CANCELLED 
AT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN BY CECIL PARKINSON THE THEN CHAIRMAN 
AS UNNECESSARY WE WERE SO FAR AHEAD WE COULDN'T LOSE NOTHING REALLY CHANGED 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS HAD BEEN SPENT BY ALL THE PARTIES IN A WAY TO GO NOWHERE 
WHICH IS A SADNESS PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE A LABOUR SUPPORTER 
I THEREFORE DECLARE 
NEIL KINNOCK ELECTED AS LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY 
LABOUR'S OVERWHELMING DEFEAT RESULTED IN THE ELECTION OF A MODERNISER 
NEIL KINNOCK BECAME THE NEW LABOUR PARTY LEADER 
ON YOUR LAST TRIP DID YOU DISCOVER WHAT THE EARTH PEOPLE EAT 
THEY EAT A GREAT MANY OF THESE 
KINNOCK WAS VERY IMAGE CONSCIOUS AND TURNED TO THE MEN 
WHO'D USED ALIENS TO SELL POTATOES TO HELP PULVERISE THE OPPOSITION 
THEY ARE CLEARLY A MOST PRIMITIVE PEOPLE 
FOR MASH GET SMASH 
LABOUR WAS STILL TRAILING THE TORIES IN THE POLLS AND THE PARTY'S OWN 
POLLING RESEARCH REVEALED KEY POLICIES LIKE RE NATIONALISATION 
AND NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT WERE OVERWHELMINGLY UNPOPULAR WITH VOTERS 
THE FIGHT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS FOR SURVIVAL 
JUST TO GET THROUGH WITH MINIMUM DAMAGE 
THEY RAN A SERIES OF ADS ATTACKING THE GOVERNMENT 
ONE HIGHLIGHTED THE RISING RATES OF CRIME 
ANOTHER MRS. THATCHER'S CALLOUS ATTITUDE TO PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS 
THE YOUNG THE OLD AND THE VULNERABLE 
THEY WERE ALMOST ALL FULL PAGE NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS 
AND WE CHARGED ABOUT CRITICISING THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS LACK OF HEART ITS LACK OF CARE THINGS LIKE THAT 
ITS FAILURE IN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND WE DARTED ABOUT 
THE REASON WE DARTED ABOUT WAS NOT TO GET STUCK ON ANY ONE SUBJECT 
WHERE WE COULD BE CRUCIFIED BY THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT 
WHO KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT WE HAD EXTRAORDINARILY UNPOPULAR POLICIES 
BUT IT WAS A QUESTION ABOUT DEFENCE THAT SET THE CAMPAIGN ALIGHT 
DURING A TELEVISION INTERVIEW KINNOCK WAS REPORTED AS SAYING 
HE WOULDN'T RETALIATE IN THE FACE OF A NUCLEAR STRIKE 
IT LED TO A SPATE OF TERRIBLE HEADLINES 
SAATCHI AND SAATCHI POUNCED 
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN THINGS HAPPEN INCREDIBLY QUICKLY 
YOU'RE WORKING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK 
LISTENING TO THE MEDIA WAITING FOR THINGS TO COME UP 
IF SOMEONE SAYS THE AD'S APPROVED WE NEED IT ON A HOARDING TOMORROW 
YOU'VE GOT TWELVE HOURS USUALLY THESE THINGS TAKE THREE OR FOUR WEEKS 
SO WE TOSSED A COIN ME AND THE GUY I WAS WITH WHO WAS GOING TO WEAR THE UNIFORM 
I WON SO HE PUT ON THE UNIFORM 
WE THEN TOOK A QUICK SNAP OF HIM SENT IT OFF TO GET PROCESSED 
PRINTED THE POSTER AND HAD IT UP THE NEXT MORNING 
AND IT MADE QUITE AN IMPACT 
NORMAN TEBBIT WAS THE CHAIRMAN 
HE WOULD SIGN OFF ALL THE WORK 
IT'S PROBABLY FAIR TO SAY MOST OF THAT CAMPAIGN WAS RUN AND APPROVED 
BY SHIRLEY HIS P. A. BECAUSE SHE HAD TO APPROVE EVERYTHING AS THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE 
MAGGIE MAGGIE MAGGIE OUT OUT OUT 
BUT IN THE FINAL WEEK OF THE EIGHTY SEVEN ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
A NEW POLL PUT LABOUR JUST BEHIND THE TORIES 
OVERNIGHT MARGARET THATCHER LOST CONFIDENCE IN SAATCHI'S 
THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY SECRETLY TURNED TO TIM BELL WHO HAD LEFT 
THE COMPANY TO START UP HIS OWN AGENCY TO COME UP WITH ALTERNATIVE ADS 
SHE WANTED TO GET ACROSS THAT THE CONSERVATIVES HAD BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL 
THAT IF YOU REJECTED THEM NOW YOU WERE THROWING AWAY A SUCCESSFUL TEAM FOR AN UNKNOWN TEAM THAT MIGHT FAIL 
BELL'S AGENCY PRODUCED HARD HITTING ADS 
THAT WERE ARGUABLY EVEN MORE NEGATIVE THAN SAATCHI'S 
I PINCHED THE LINE FROM DAVID WINDLESHAM'S FIFTY NINE CAMPAIGN 
BRITAIN'S A SUCCESS DON'T LET LABOUR RUIN IT 
SHE LOVED THEM THEY WERE EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED 
THE ADS WERE IMPOSED ON SAATCHI AND SAATCHI WHO WERE FURIOUS AND HATED IT AND HATED ME 
AND THEY CHANGED THE BOTTOM LINE 
TO BRITAIN'S GREAT AGAIN DON'T LET LABOUR WRECK IT 
MARGARET THATCHER PUT HER FAITH IN THEM SPENDING THREE MILLION 
IN THE LAST FOUR DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN AND WINNING BY A LANDSLIDE 
BUT BY NINETEEN NINETY TWO SHE'D BEEN REPLACED BY JOHN MAJOR 
THE ECONOMY WAS IN RECESSION INTEREST RATES WERE AT TEN PER CENT 
AND MANY HOMEOWNERS WERE STUCK IN NEGATIVE EQUITY 
NEIL KINNOCK SAID HIS WAS NOW THE PARTY OF ECONOMIC COMPETENCE 
NOW IS THE TIME FOR OUR COUNTRY TO START PULLING TOGETHER 
YOU CAN'T RUBBISH THE OPPOSITION IN QUITE THE SAME WAY BECAUSE 
BLESS THEM THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING 
THEY'VE JUST BEEN OPPOSING 
SO THE IDEA CAME UP THAT WE SHOULD COST ALL THEIR PROMISES 
SAATCHI'S EXPLOSIVE IDEA WAS LABOUR'S TAX BOMBSHELL 
THE AD MEN WORKING FOR KINNOCK WERE BLOWN AWAY 
I THINK THE LABOUR TAX BOMBSHELL CAMPAIGN 
WAS QUITE THE BEST PIECE OF POLITICAL ADVERTISING 
PROBABLY SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
BECAUSE IT WAS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THE COMBINATION OF A GOOD BIT 
OF THINKING ABOUT THE VULNERABILITY OF LABOUR AND A DRAMATIC AND SIMPLE 
AND NOTICEABLE VISUAL AND THE TIMING WAS VERY GOOD 
PEOPLE WERE FEELING EXTREMELY VULNERABLE AT THE TIME 
LABOUR'S TAX BOMBSHELL IS SOMETHING THAT 
WENT INTO THE LANGUAGE IS STILL IN THE LANGUAGE BUT ALSO COMING UP WITH THE FIGURE 
WHAT WAS THEIR BOMBSHELL WHAT WOULD COST THE AVERAGE FAMILY 
ONCE WE HAD THAT FACT THEN WE COULD RUN WITH THAT FACT COME UP WITH THE IMAGERY 
YOU WON'T WIN PEOPLE OVER 
BECAUSE THE POSTER IS A RELATIVELY WEAK MEDIUM 
FOR PENETRATING THE BRAIN THERE'S NO MUSIC NO SOUND 
IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE BEST AMERICAN POLITICAL COMMUNICATION 
OR EVEN SOME PARTY BROADCASTS YOU'VE A BIGGER RANGE OF EMOTIONAL WEAPONRY 
IN SEVEN SECONDS YOU DON'T CHANGE ANYBODY'S MIND 
YOU REINFORCE A BELIEF YOU CREATE CONTROVERSY 
YOU LIGHT THE BONFIRE OF PUBLICITY BUT YOU SELDOM CHANGE A MIND 
THE BOMBSHELL IDEA BECAME THE CENTREPIECE 
IN AN EQUALLY DESTRUCTIVE ELECTION BROADCAST 
THE TAX BOMBSHELL BROADCAST WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A MAN 
PAINTING THE SIGN ON THE BOMB THAT WAS IT 
BUT YOU GET ONE THING ACROSS 
THE AVERAGE TAXPAYER WOULD END UP 
BEING HIT BY AN EXTRA ONE ZERO TAX BILL 
THE POINT ABOUT ADVERTISING 
IS THAT IT HAS TO FEED INTO A CURRENT PERCEPTION 
IT CAN STRENGTHEN IT IT CAN BOOST IT IT CAN PUSH IT FORWARD 
BUT UNLESS THERE IS A PERCEPTION THEN THE ADVERTISING WON'T WORK 
AND WHY THE TAX BOMBSHELL IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WORKED WAS BECAUSE 
THERE WAS STILL A LACK OF CONFIDENCE AMONGST ENOUGH MEMBERS 
OF THE ELECTORATE PARTICULARLY THE SWING VOTERS 
THAT LABOUR HAD PUT ASIDE ITS OLD APPARENT COMMITMENT 
TO HIGHER TAXATION AS PEOPLE SAW IT UNNECESSARILY HIGH TAXATION FOR THAT ADVERTISEMENT TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE 
THE EXPERTS CAN'T SAY CONCLUSIVELY 
THAT THE BOMBSHELL AD LOST LABOUR THE ELECTION 
THERE WERE OTHER NEGATIVE ATTACKS THAT FOLLOWED 
AND A HOSTILE CONSERVATIVE PRESS ALSO WADED IN 
WE'RE ALL RIGHT 
THE TRIUMPHALISM OF LABOUR'S PRE ELECTION SHEFFIELD RALLY FURTHER ALIENATED THE FLOATING VOTERS 
IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT EVER PINNING DOWN 
THE EFFECT OF ANY AD OR CAMPAIGN DURING AN ELECTION 
AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE RUN THE NUMBERS AND SAID IT HAS NO EFFECT 
I THINK IT SELF EVIDENTLY DOES HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE PARTY 
AND HOW EFFECTIVE THE PARTY IS 
HOW THE PARTY FEELS AND ACTS AND TALKS AND BEHAVES 
AND IF YOU CAN GET THE CONFIDENCE GOING AND THE FOCUS GOING WITHIN THE PARTY ITSELF THAT'S ENOUGH 
IN ITSELF THAT EVERYONE IS SAYING THE SAME THING THE SAME SINGLE MESSAGE 
THEY'RE NOT ARGUING AMONGST THEMSELVES 
SO IF SAYING YOUR POLICIES ARE BETTER DOESN'T WORK 
AND NEGATIVE ADVERTISING BACKFIRES THERE'S ANOTHER OPTION 
SELL THE LEADER 
THEY'RE THE MOST RECOGNISED SYMBOL OF A POLITICAL BRAND AND WITH YOUR HELP 
HE OR SHE MIGHT JUST CAST A PERSUASIVE SPELL OVER THE VOTER 
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST OF THE PYTHON REPEATS IT'S A PARTY POLITICAL 
I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE SECONDS TO SWITCH OVER 
IN THE PAST THE LEADERS DIDN'T WANT THE AD MEN'S HELP 
THEY SOLD THEMSELVES 
WE CAN BE SATISFIED THE WAY THINGS HAVE GONE LATELY CAN'T WE 
YES WE'VE GOT THROUGH OUR PROGRAMME WELL 
I'VE JUST COME FROM THE HOUSE AND WE'RE RIGHT UP TO DATE 
THE FIRST TIME AD MEN WERE DRAFTED IN 
TO POLISH A LEADER'S IMAGE WAS IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES 
TED HEATH WAS DIFFIDENT STUFFY AND REMOTE 
AND IN A GROUND BREAKING BROADCAST HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED 
TO BE REPACKAGED TO MAKE HIM APPEAR MORE HUMAN 
COLD 
ALOOF 
DISTANT 
THESE WERE THE KIND OF WORDS THE PRESS WERE ALWAYS READY TO TROT OUT ABOUT TED HEATH 
AS THE ELECTION GOT INTO ITS STRIDE THEY BEGAN TO USE THEM LESS 
HEATH WAS A MAN COME TO LIFE AND CLEARLY ENJOYING HIMSELF 
AND THEN AS THE DAYS SHORTENED HIS MESSAGE BEGAN TO GET THROUGH 
OR PERHAPS IT'S THE QUALITY OF THE MAN THAT'S BEGUN TO GET THROUGH 
PEOPLE HAVE BEGUN TO REALISE THAT THIS ISN'T JUST ANOTHER POLITICIAN TALKING 
PERHAPS HE'S NOT AN EASY MAN TO KNOW BUT WHEN THEY KNOW HIM PEOPLE FEEL HE'S A MAN WORTH KNOWING 
MARGARET THATCHER WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY TO BE DRESSED UP AND MARKETED 
IF YOU'VE GOT A GOOD THING TO SELL 
USE EVERY SINGLE CAPACITY YOU CAN TO SELL IT 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 
NO ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 
IT'S A LOWERING NOT A RAISING 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 
THAT'S IT 
TO SAY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 
MARGARET THATCHER WAS THE BEST PRODUCT TO SELL 
THE PRODUCTS THEY WERE THEN SELLING 
NICE GUYS IN LOTS OF WAYS WEREN'T NEARLY AS GOOD 
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT NOT JUST OF THE COMMUNICATION 
KINNOCK HAD A BOMBASTIC PERSONA WHICH NEEDED A MAKE OVER 
BUT HE DID HAVE A WAY WITH WORDS 
IF MARGARET THATCHER WINS ON THURSDAY 
I WARN YOU NOT TO BE ORDINARY 
I WARN YOU NOT TO BE YOUNG 
I WARN YOU NOT TO FALL ILL 
AND I WARN YOU NOT TO GROW OLD 
THE QUESTION WAS HOW TO PROMOTE NEIL APPEAL AND RE LAUNCH LABOUR 
THE ANSWER TO GET A GLOSSY COMMERCIALS MAKER OR BETTER STILL 
THE DIRECTOR OF THE OSCAR WINNING BLOCKBUSTER CHARIOTS OF FIRE 
I IIIL IIIILIIII IIII IIILIIIII 
HE WAS A WELSHMAN AND HE'S A GREAT GUY NEIL 
BUT HE WASN'T AS THEY CALL TELEGENIC AND SO WE DECIDED TO TRY 
AND UP HIS IMAGE AND SHOW PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY WHAT HE WAS 
WAS A PASSIONATE 
AND DEEPLY POLITICAL MAN WITH PEOPLE'S INTERESTS AT HEART 
HUDSON MADE WHAT'S DUBBED KINNOCK THE MOVIE 
I THINK THAT THE REAL PRIVILEGE OF BEING STRONG 
IS THE POWER THAT IT GIVES YOU TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT STRONG 
I THINK THE REAL PRIVILEGE OF BEING FIT 
IT'S A HIGHLY FLATTERING PROMO TRYING TO REINVENT THE MAN 
IS THE ABILITY THAT GIVES YOU TO GIVE OTHERS A HELPING HAND 
I THINK IT BROKE NEW GROUND 
IN TERMS OF BEING A BIOGRAPHICAL FILM 
AND OBVIOUSLY WE NOW KNOW WE VOTE FOR PEOPLE 
NOT FOR POLICIES OR POLITICIANS WE WANT TO KNOW THE PEOPLE 
BOTH MY PARENTS DIED AT THE BACK END OF NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE 
WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF EACH OTHER 
THAT WAS 
BUT I HAD THIS IMMENSE GOOD FORTUNE OF HAVING GLENYS 
I LIKED HIM A BIT MORE AT THE END I TRUSTED HIM A BIT MORE 
AND I RESPECTED HIM A BIT MORE 
AND THOSE ARE THREE IMPORTANT BOXES TO TICK FOR ANY BOSS OR LEADER THAT 
YOU HAVE SO I THINK IT WAS IMPRESSIVE ON ALL ACCOUNTS 
IT WAS AN EFFECTIVE PIECE OF POLITICAL ADVERTISING AND IT CHANGED POLITICAL ADVERTISING I THINK 
AND IT INCREASED HIS POPULARITY OVERNIGHT 
BY SIXTEEN PER CENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN PER CENT 
THEY CAN'T BE TROTTING DOWN TO TIMES SQUARE 
JOHN MAJOR TOO LOOKED TO HOLLYWOOD AND TO THE DIRECTOR OF ANOTHER OSCAR WINNER MIDNIGHT COWBOY 
HEY I'M WALKING HERE I AM WALKING HERE 
UP YOURS YOU SON OF A BITCH 
WHEN YOU SEE THE HOUSE AHEAD WITH THE TWO WHITE ARCHES 
IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE THERE THAT IS WHERE WE LIVED 
IS IT STILL THERE 
JOHN SCHLESINGER CHOSE A MORE DOCUMENTARY STYLE WITH MAJOR 
IT'S STILL THERE 
TRAVELLING AROUND BRIXTON IN SOUTH LONDON AND PLAYING ON HIS HUMBLE BEGINNINGS 
WE USED TO COME IN AND BUY KIPPERS 
WE STILL SELL THE KIPPERS I'LL HAVE SOME KIPPERS 
IF YOU'D SAID TO ME AT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YOU'RE GONNA BE A POLITICIAN 
I'D HAVE SAID FORGET IT ANYTHING ELSE 
ANYTHING BUT BEING A POLITICIAN 
WHY COS I THOUGHT POLITICIANS WERE COMPLETE PAINS IN THE BACKSIDE 
FOR TONY BLAIR'S SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
THE AD MEN BROUGHT IN DOCUMENTARY MAKER MOLLY DINEEN TO GIVE HIS FILM CINEMA VERITE AUTHENTICITY 
YOU JUST HAVE TO DO IT 
PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THINGS CAN CHANGE 
BUT IF YOUR LEADER CAN'T WIN OVER THE VOTERS WITH THEIR SINCERITY 
IT'S PROBABLY TIME FOR THE HARD SELL 
TO IGNORE THEM AND GO FOR THE JUGULAR 
WITH A PERSONAL ATTACK ON THE OPPOSITION'S TOP MAN 
PARTY LEADERS ARE THE MOST RECOGNISABLE BRAND IMAGE OF THE PARTY 
AND IF YOU ATTACK THE PARTY LEADER IT'S A QUICK AND EASY 
AND UNDERSTANDABLE WAY TO MOST FLOATING VOTERS OF ATTACKING THE PARTY 
GETTING PERSONAL IS NOTHING NEW 
IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES SAATCHI PRODUCED AN AD SHOWING A PICTURE OF MICHAEL FOOT WITH THE HEADLINE 
EVEN PENSIONERS ARE BETTER OFF WITH THE CONSERVATIVES 
BUT EVEN MRS. THATCHER WOULDN'T BUY IT 
BUT AS THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN ELECTION APPROACHED 
THE CONSERVATIVES WERE MIRED IN SLEAZE 
SO HOW TO DEFLECT ATTENTION FROM IT 
WELL GET INSULTINGLY PERSONAL AND RUN A POLITICAL AD 
THAT WILL BECOME THE FIRST EVER TO BE BANNED 
JOHN MAJOR WAS DEEPLY UNPOPULAR 
THE CONSERVATIVES WERE VERY UNPOPULAR AS A PARTY 
THEIR IMAGE WAS BAD 
AND WE WERE CONFRONTED WITH A HOPELESS TASK 
WE HAD TO FIND SOMETHING WRONG WITH NEW LABOUR 
BECAUSE NEW LABOUR WAS GENIUS 
WE HAVE CHANGED THE LABOUR PARTY 
NOW THE LABOUR PARTY WANTS TO EARN YOUR TRUST TO CHANGE BRITAIN 
BLAIR WAS FANTASTICALLY IMPRESSIVE HE WAS DRESSING UP TO BE ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE AND IT WAS VERY HARD 
WE NEEDED A CAMPAIGN IDEA 
I REMEMBER PEOPLE SAYING WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIM 
THERE'S SOMETHING JUST NOT QUITE TRUSTWORTHY ABOUT 
WHAT'S BEHIND THOSE EYES THAT SMILE THAT LOOK THAT IMAGE 
IS HE SOMEONE PEOPLE WILL TRUST 
THE CONSERVATIVES WENT TO THE NEW SAATCHI AGENCY M. AND AMP C. SAATCHI 
IN THE HOPE THAT THEY'D COME UP WITH AN IDEA THAT WOULD DEMOLISH TONY BLAIR 
WHAT THEY CREATED BECAME AN ADVERTISING LEGEND 
WE'D ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO SAY THE TORIES NEVER PUT TAXES UP 
SO A LOT OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT CLAIMS 
THAT HAD GIVEN US THE ARMOUR BEHIND THE CAMPAIGNS THAT WE'D DONE 
FOR THE TORIES WE'D LOST THEM 
THE IDEA THEN WAS SINCE WE'D LOST OUR CLAIMS 
WE'D HAVE A FAR MORE EMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN 
THE IMAGE THEY CREATED WAS ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE IN ADVERTISING HISTORY 
THE GUY WHO ART DIRECTED IT HE TOOK SOMEONE'S EYES A COLLEAGUE TOOK A SHOT OF THEM 
HE WAS LOOKING AT THEM TURNED THEM UPSIDE DOWN AND WENT WOW THAT'S CREEPY 
THE CONTROVERSIAL BLAIR DEMON EYES ADVERT 
APPEARED ONLY ONCE IN THREE SUNDAY NEWSPAPERS 
WITH THE CATCHLINE NEW LABOUR NEW DANGER 
IT WAS PART OF A PEERING EYE CAMPAIGN 
WE CAME UP WITH THESE EYES SUBSEQUENTLY CALLED THE DEMON EYES 
AND THESE EYES WOULD BE PEERING AT YOU FROM WHEREVER 
NOTHING DEFINITE YOU COULD PUT YOUR FINGER ON 
BUT MALEVOLENT EYES JUST KEEPING AN EYE ON YOU 
SORRY YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WITH THE FLASHLIGHTS 
IT'S MAKING MY EYES RED 
WHILE BLAIR TO TRIED TO LAUGH IT OFF IT WAS IMMEDIATELY CRITICISED BY HIS PARTY AND THE CHURCH 
AND NOW IT'S THE DEVIL WITH THE DEMON EYES 
LOOK CAN'T WE JUST GO BACK TO BAMBI 
I HAVE TO SAY IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ANYONE 
THAT THEY WOULD BE CALLED DEMON EYES 
THAT IT WOULD BE COUNTED AS HAVING A RELIGIOUS IMPACT 
IT CAUSED OFFENCE OBVIOUSLY IN CERTAIN QUARTERS MUCH COMMENT 
I THINK LARGELY NEGATIVE AT THE TIME 
I REMEMBER THINKING MYSELF WAS THIS THE RIGHT THING TO HAVE DONE 
AND PROBABLY THINKING IT WAS AN ERROR TO RUN IT 
THEN IT GOT WITHDRAWN 
THE ADVERTISING STANDARDS AUTHORITY BANNED THE AD 
FOR ITS OFFENSIVE PORTRAYAL OF TONY BLAIR BUT DESPITE THE RULING 
INDUSTRY MAGAZINE CAMPAIGN NAMED DEMON EYES POSTER OF THE YEAR 
IN TERMS OF GETTING PUBLICITY 
IT WAS A FANTASTIC PIECE OF ADVERTISING 
AND THAT'S WHY OTHER ADVERTISERS LIKE IT 
POLITICALLY YOU CAN ARGUE THAT IT WAS AN AWFUL MISTAKE 
IT WAS BRILLIANTLY CONCEIVED CREATIVELY BUT WE NEVER REALLY SOLVED THE QUESTION 
WE NEVER DECIDED WHAT IT WAS WE THOUGHT WAS DANGEROUS ABOUT LABOUR 
IT'S A GOOD DEMONSTRATION OF ONE OF THE PROBLEMS 
WHICH PEOPLE HAVE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE BRAIN WORKS 
BECAUSE DEMON EYES OF SOMEBODY WHO'S BECOMING POPULAR 
LOTS OF PEOPLE LIKE HIM AND SUDDENLY HE'S TARRED WITH THIS BRUSH 
YOU DON'T LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THAT TO YOUR NEW GOOD FRIEND TONY BLAIR 
BUT M. AND AMP C. SAATCHI HAD WANTED TO GO EVEN FURTHER 
THAN DEMON EYES IN A COMMERCIAL 
HOW CAN I WIN 
AND EMPLOYED A FAUSTIAN TYPE FIGURE TO STOP BLAIR 
GETTING INTO NUMBER TEN 
FOUR TIMES IN A ROW WE'VE LOST 
THEY'VE MADE ME LABOUR LEADER IN ORDER TO WIN 
WE'VE GOT TO WIN OR I'M FINISHED 
BUT HOW 
THE IDEA OF THE BROADCAST 
BEING ADVISED BY A P. R. TYPE 
MANDELSON TYPE FIGURE AS TO WHAT HE WOULD NEED TO SAY TO GET ELECTED 
I CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO WIN 
WHO ARE YOU 
DOESN'T MATTER I CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO WIN 
IF YOU SEE THE WHOLE OF THE FILM WHAT YOU SEE IS A COMPLETE GRASP OF WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO 
PRETEND TO BE WHAT PEOPLE WANTED WHILE DOING WHATEVER HE FELT LIKE DOING 
YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
SAY YOU WON'T PUT UP TAXES 
BUT I WILL SO WHAT JUST SAY IT 
GO ON I KNOW I'D HAVE TO PUT UP TAXES JUST SAY IT 
SAY IT 
I 
I I WON'T PUT UP TAXES 
YOU HAD THIS SHADOWY FIGURE BEHIND HIM SAYING YES YOU CAN 
JUST TELL THEM WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR 
SO IT WAS SELLING YOUR SOUL AND NOT BEING HONEST 
AND FROM A CREATIVE POINT OF VIEW 
IT WAS A POWERFUL PIECE OF COMMUNICATION 
BUT IT WAS DECIDED IT WAS JUST TOO UNPLEASANT TOO RISKY 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEAN IT 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT JUST SAY IT 
MAJOR THOUGHT IT WOULD CAUSE A TERRIBLE CONTROVERSY FOR NO PURPOSE 
YES 
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHOLE CAMPAIGN WAS RUN BY 
A COLLECTION OF PEOPLE WHO ALL KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO LOSE 
NEW LABOUR WON A ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT SEAT MAJORITY 
A NEW DAWN HAS BROKEN HAS IT NOT 
THEY'D SPENT A RECORD SEVEN MILLION ON ADVERTISING 
A TRULY TERRIBLE NIGHT FOR THE CONSERVATIVES 
BUT THE NEW DAWN DIDN'T MAKE THEIR ADVERTISING ANY LESS PERSONAL 
IN POWER NEW LABOUR RECRUITED TREVOR BEATTIE THE MAN BEHIND THE UPLIFTING WONDERBRA ADS 
IN THE TWO THOUSAND ONE ELECTION BEATTIE PRODUCED AN AD RIDICULING 
THE BALDING CONSERVATIVE LEADER WILLIAM HAGUE 
GIVING HIM A WIG TO LOOK LIKE A THATCHERITE CLONE 
AND WHEN MICHAEL HOWARD TOOK OVER THE LEADERSHIP 
NEW LABOUR HAD TO REBUT CHARGES OF ANTI SEMITISM 
SO FAR THIS YEAR THEY'VE COMPARED ME TO FAGIN 
TO SHYLOCK AND TO A FLYING PIG 
THE CAMPAIGN FROM TIME TO TIME GETS HARD AND YOU HAVE TO BE TOUGH IN THE WAY YOU CAMPAIGN 
I'M AFRAID SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO HAVE TOUGH NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING 
TO GO WITH THE POSITIVE CAMPAIGNING 
THE NECESSITY WAS IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE ELECTION WHICH ALTHOUGH WE WON IT COMFORTABLY WAS MUCH MUCH CLOSER 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A MAJORITY GOING DOWN FROM THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTIES TO THE SIXTIES 
MORE AND MORE IT REFLECTS HOW POLITICS IS WHICH IS ABOUT THE CULT OF THE PERSONALITY 
I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S LEGITIMATE 
IT IS INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE DECISIONS 
PERSONALITIES WHO MAKE DECISIONS SO WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS 
AS AD MEN YOU'VE EARNED A FORTUNE IN FEES AND COMMISSIONS 
WORKING FOR THE POLITICAL PARTIES OVER THE YEARS 
BUT WHAT WILL TOMORROW BRING 
AT THE LAST ELECTION NEWSPAPER ADS BILLBOARDS AND TELEVISION WERE VITAL 
NOW THE INTERNET IS THE GROWING MEDIUM 
THE SECOND THE SECOND I IIIL 
IT WAS A CREED WRITTEN INTO THE FOUNDING DOCUMENTS 
THAT DECLARED THE DESTINY OF A NATION YES WE CAN 
THIS IS A WEB POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE BARACK OBAMA 
WILL.I.AM FROM THE POPULAR U. S. HIT POP GROUP BLACK EYED PEAS TURNED ONE OF HIS SPEECHES INTO A SONG 
AS THEY STRUCK OUT FROM DISTANT SHORES 
MILLIONS OF YOUNG AMERICANS HAVE WATCHED IT 
BUT IT DIDN'T COST OBAMA A DIME 
THE IDEA CAME FROM WILLI.AM HIMSELF WHO WANTED TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION 
A PRESIDENT WHO CHOSE THE MOON 
IT'S TRITE SUPERVISION MAYBE THAT'S HOW POLITICAL ADVERTISING 
IS GONNA GO AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT IS PRESENTED TO US NOWADAYS 
JUSTICE AND EQUALITY YES WE CAN 
YES WE CAN 
YES WE CAN 
YES WE CAN YOU KNOW YOU YOU CATCH IT AND THEN 
I THINK IT HAD SIX MILLION HITS ON THE FIRST NIGHT 
CERTAINLY IN THE FIRST WEEK YOU CAN SEE IT GROWING 
EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT IT'S NOT ABOUT ANYTHING 
IF OBAMA MAKES IT TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
THIS COULD BECOME THE MOST POPULAR MEANS FOR GETTING ACROSS A POLITICAL MESSAGE 
REMEMBER ADVERTISING IS A TRANSMISSION SYSTEM 
WHAT WE'RE LEARNING FROM THE WEB IS IT NEEDS TO BE INTERACTIVE SO WE NEED NEW TECHNIQUES 
I THINK WE WILL SEE AN EVOLUTION OF COMMUNICATION TO DO 
IN THE WEB SPACE WHAT WAS DONE BY SAATCHI'S ON THE POSTER SPACE 
TODAY IS THE NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF TONY BLAIR COMING TO POWER 
AND I WANT TO TALK TO YOU STRAIGHT 
THEN ONE DAY A TINY CRACK APPEARED 
IN BRITAIN ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES NOW HAVE AN INTERNET PRESENCE 
BUT THEY CAN ONLY DREAM OF REACHING 
THE NUMBERS WHO'VE WATCHED YES WE CAN 
SO DAVID JOINED SOME OTHER LITTLE BLUE CHUMS IN A BLUE PARTY CALLED THE CONSERVATIVES 
THE INTERNET WILL BE AN INTERESTING ADDITIONAL TOOL 
I DON'T THINK IT WILL REPLACE THE TRADITIONAL MEDIA 
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE ROLE OF ADVERTISING COMMUNICATION 
DURING CAMPAIGNS WILL DIMINISH 
FOR THE MOMENT TRADITIONAL FORMS OF POLITICAL PROPAGANDA 
ARE AS NECESSARY AS THE PHOTO OPPORTUNITY AND THE SOUND BITE 
BUT UNLIKE COKE IS IT NIKE'S JUST DO IT 
OR LOREAL'S BECAUSE YOU'RE WORTH IT THE POLITICAL PARTIES' AD MEN HAVE ONLY CREATED 
A HANDFUL OF MEMORABLE CAMPAIGNS 
AND FOR THE MOST PART THEY HAVE HAD LITTLE LASTING IMPACT 
SO MUCH RIDES ON THE OUTCOME THEY'LL DO IT JUST IN CASE IT'S GONNA WORK 
ON TOP OF WHICH ELECTIONS ARE TRENCH WARFARE 
IF BOTH SIDES DON'T DO IT IT PROBABLY WON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT THE OTHER SIDE IS GONNA DO IT 
SO IF THEY'RE LOBBING SHELLS AT YOU IF YOU DON'T LOB SHELLS BACK THEY'LL MAKE GAINS 
SO YOU NEED TO LOB SHELLS BACK 
ON THE WHOLE THESE CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT AND NOTHING CHANGES 
BROADLY THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT HAPPENS IN MOST ELECTIONS 
DO YOU REMEMBER ANY BROADCASTS IN PARTICULAR THAT YOU'VE SEEN 
OOH I CAN'T THINK OF 'EM STRAIGHT AWAY 
I LOOK AT 'EM AND I REMEMBER 'EM THEN I FORGET THEM 
THIS IS THE GOUGH MAP ONE OF THE OLDEST SURVIVING MAPS OF BRITAIN
