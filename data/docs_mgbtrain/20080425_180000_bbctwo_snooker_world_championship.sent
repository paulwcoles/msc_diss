WE ARE INTO THE SECOND STAGE OF THE 
WORLD SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIP IT IS 
JUST A BAD A FULL HOUSE TONIGHT 
EVERYBODY IS SETTLING INTO THEIR 
SEATS FOR THIS EVENING ABOUT ON 
ONLY SIX OCCASIONS IN THE LAST TWENTY 
YEARS HAS STEPHEN HENDRY FAILED TO 
GET TO THE QUARTER FINAL STAGES AT 
LEAST HE LOOKS WELL ON HIS WAY 
AFTER HIS OPENING SESSION AGAINST 
DING JUNHUI THIS YEAR HAVING 
BATTLED THROUGH THEIR FIRST MATCHES 
OF THE TOURNAMENT BY JUST A SINGLE 
FRAME STEPHEN HENDRY AND DING 
JUNHUI WERE HOPING TO MAKE THE MOST 
OF THE SECOND ROUND OPPORTUNITY IT 
WAS THE SCOT WHO GOT OFF TO A 
PERFECT START DOING WAS ABLE TO 
SETTLE HIS NOSE UP TO TAKE A 
SCRAPPY SECOND NERVES AND WHEN 
DING JUNHUI MISS THIS EASY BLACK 
STEPHEN HENDRY CLEARED UP THE 
SESSION THE INTERVAL DID NOTHING 
TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE MATCH 
AN IMPRESSIVE HENDRY CLEARED UP FOR 
THE SECOND TIME WITH NEITHER 
PLAYER AT THE RACES IN FRAME SIX 
IT WAS SETTLED BY AN ERROR THE 
PRESSURE TAKING ITS TOLL ON DE 
YOUNG FELLOW FROM CHINA A YOUNG 
FELLOW 
ANOTHER CENTURY AND THINGS WERE 
LOOKING OMINOUS FOR THE CHINESE 
PLAYER DING JUNHUI IS NOT AL THREE 
TIME CHAMPION FOR NOTHING HE 
REDUCED HIS ARREARS TO IN THE 
FINAL SESSION WHAT WAS YOUR 
READING OF EVENTS 
I AM DELIGHTED 
FOR STEPHEN HENDRY HE PUT DING 
JUNHUI ON THE BACK FOOT HE LOOKED 
STRANGELY SUBDUED AND A BIT FLAT 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO LOOK BOUNCY WHEN 
YOUR OPPONENT IS DOMINATING 
CONSIDERING DING JUNHUI IT WAS THE 
FAVOURITE IT IS A BIT OF A 
SURPRISE 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW KROGH SURPRISE A CLAUSTROPHOBIC THIS PLACE IS

WE ARE GOING TO WATCH THIS MATCH 
PROGRESSES IT IS THE SECOND OF 
THREE POSSIBLE SESSIONS JOHN VIRGO 
DENNIS TAYLOR ARE STANDING RIGHT IN 
THE COMMENTARY BOX THIS MATCH IS 
NOT QUITE WHAT WE EXPECTED SO FAR 
IS IT GENTLEMEN 
NOT QUITE IT IS 
GOING TO BE A FASCINATING SESSION 
CAN THIS YOUNG CHINESE PLAYER START 
OF THIS SESSION THE WAY HE FINISHED 
THE FIRST SESSION 
NOT THE BEST BREAK OFF SHOT HE HAS 
LEFT A POT ON FOR IS STEPHEN HENDRY 
WHO STARTED THIS MATCH WITH A 
MAGNIFICENT BREAK OF ONE TO FOUR 
HAS HAZEL SAID HE HAS WON THREE 
WORLD RANKING TITLES 
WHAT AN ORDEAL HE FACES HERE THIS 
EVENING THAT IS A BIT UNLUCKY HE 
PLAYED IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE 
ONLY RED HE COULD LEAVE WAS THE ONE 
HE WAS 
TAKING ON 
LOOK WHERE IT HAS 
FINISHED THE ONLY CONSOLATION IT 
IS THE BLACK IS OUT OF POSITION 
CONSOLATION 
HE PLAYED IT WELL YOU WOULD FEEL 
HE HAS TO GET OFF TO A GOOD START 
THIS EVENING HASN'T HE DING DING JUNHUI HAS GOT TO SHOW 
THE EIGHT 
FRAMES THAT ARE SCHEDULED THIS 
EVENING OBVIOUSLY IF HE COULD WIN 
FIVE TO THREE IT WOULD BE A LOT BETTER IF 
HE LOSES THIS SESSION HE WOULD 
HAVE TOO MUCH TO DO COME THE FINAL 
SESSION TOMORROW AFTERNOON 
IT LOOKS A BIT TIGHT AS TO WHETHER 
HE CAN GET ON THE BLACK HE FEELS AS IF HE CAN POT THE BLACK 
INCH PERFECT THE BLACK IS 
AVAILABLE INTO BOTH CORNER POCKETS 
IT IS A GOOD CHANCE EARLY ON IT IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE HOW 
STEPHEN GOES ABOUT THIS 
THE OTHER RED LOOKED THE BETTER RED 
DIDN'T IT 
HE WILL GO INTO THEM THIS TIME IF 
THE WHITE STICKS IN THE BUNCH IT 
WOULD BE AVAILABLE 
HE HAS DEVELOPED AT LEAST TWO REDS 
THIS ONE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE 
AVAILABLE 
HE HAS UNDERHIT THAT HE HAS UNDER 
HE TIPPED BY LONG WAY AND HE 
HIT IT THAT IS SURPRISE UNDERHIT 
LOOK WHERE HE HAS PUT THE CUE BALL 
HE HAS THE CHOICE OF REDS 
A LITTLE HEAVY CONTACT HE IS GOING 
TO HAVE TO FIND THE PATH BETWEEN 
THE BROWN AND GREEN 
HE CAUGHT THE GREEN 
NOT ENOUGH 
LEFT HAND SIDE ON THE CUE BALL 
DIFFICULT 
THE REASON HE PLAYED THAT SHOT 
BEAT ANY RED HE COULD LEAVE WAS THE 
ONE HE PLAYED THE ONLY HE WAS 
COVERING THE RED IF HE HAD GOT IT 
IN THE JAWS OF THE POCKET IT IS A 
BIT OF A CHANCE FOR DING JUNHUI 
NORMALLY COME UP WE SAY HIT INTO 
THE PINK NORMALLY WE SAVE L. 
THINK HE SHOULD GO FOR IT THE PINK 
I AM WITH YOU IF HE HITS THE PINK 
HE COULD HIT IT HALF BALL 
HE WENT INTO THE PINK HE MAY NOT 
BE ON ONE UNLESS A RED PASSES THE 
PINK 
HE DID NOT REALLY NEED TO HIT THEM 
THAT HARD THEY WERE NOT TIGHTLY 
BUNCHED 
HE IS STRUGGLING THAT WAS THE SHOT 
HE WOULD EXPECT HIM TO GET NINETY NINE TIMES 
OUT OF ONE HUNDRED QUITE AN AMAZING 
STATISTIC WHEN YOU THINK THAT HIS 
GAME IS BUILT AROUND POTTING AND 
BREAK BUILDING APART FROM AN EIGHTY 
BREAK HE HAS NOT MADE A BREAK OVER 
THIRTY 
THAT WAS A GOOD POT FROM THIRTY STEPHEN HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET 
IT IN AND OUT OF PORK TO GET ON TO 
THE NEXT RED BULK THE LINE HE 
WOULD HAVE TO TAKE TO GET TO B. THREE 
REDS HE WOULD HAVE TO SCREW DOWN 
OFF THE SIDE BOTTOM CUSHION AND 
TOWARDS THE RED 
HOW DOES THIS ONE POT CRAIG THINK 
HE IS JUST O. K. I THINK 
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD SHOT HE DOES 
NOT LIKE IT BET THAT ALL HE WAS 
STRETCHING TO MATCH I NEVER THE 
RED GOES BUT HE WAS OVERSTRETCHED 
EITHER 
DING JUNHUI CANNOT BE HAPPY WITH 
HIS PERFORMANCE TODAY THIS IS NOT 
THE START HE WAS LOOKING FOR 
I THINK WHAT HE WILL HAVE TO LEARN 
TO COPE WITH HIS WE KNOW THERE 
SO MANY PEOPLE WATCHING HIM BACK 
HOME HE IS ONLY A YOUNG MAN 
THERE IS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON HIS 
SHOULDERS 
THAT WAS A NICE SHOT 
HE CAME TO 
THE TABLE SIXTY SEVEN POINTS BEHIND 
MAYBE IT IS JUST A BIT OF POTTING 
PRACTICE FACE SAYS SOMETIMES IT IS 
EASY TO GET THERE BUT HARDER TO 
SAVE HARDER TO STAY THERE 
HE HAD A TERRIFIC START TO HIS 
CAREER JUST THE LAST COUPLE OF 
SEASONS HE HAS LOOKED VULNERABLE 
THIS IS A BIG CHALLENGE FOR HIM 
THIS EVENING 
IF HE CAN KNOCK THE BLACK IN HE 
CAN START LOOKING FOR SNOOKERS HE 
MUST POT ON THE BLACK 
HE HAS CONCEDED THE FRAME WHAT A 
START FOR STEPHEN HENDRY FOLSTAD HE 
EXTENDS HIS LEAD 
VETS GET A 
CHECK ON JOHN HIGGINS LET'S GET 
HE DID NOT HAPPY HE DID NOT LOOK 
HAPPY IN THE SECOND SESSION AGAINST 
RYAN DAY JOHN HIGGINS'S LEAD RYAN 
DAY FIVE TO THREE AS THEY BEGAN THEIR SECOND 
SESSION THIS AFTERNOON JOHN 
HIGGINS THERE WAS A BIZARRE IN OFF 
BRIAN TATE POUNCED WHEN HIGGINS 
COULD NOT POT A VITAL BLANC GREEN 
RYAN DAY HIGGINS'S FRUSTRATION 
WAS BEGINNING TO MATCH RYAN DAY 
NARROWED THE GAP TO SIX TO FIVE A COOL 
DOUBLE IN FRAME TWELVE SAW HIM HEAD 
INTO THE MID SESSION INTERVAL ALL 
SQUARE AT SIX TO SIX HIGGINS VENTED HIS 
ANGER ON THE CUE BALL THIS TIME 
HIS MOOD WAS PROBABLY NOT HELPED 
WHEN RYAN TICK THE THIRTEENTH FRAME AND A 
SEVEN TO SIX LEAD BACK CAME THE SCOT TO 
LEVEL THE MATCH WITH A BREAK OF NINETY NINE 
A KNOCK OFF FIFTY FOUR IN THE PENULTIMATE 
FRAME OF THE AFTERNOON SAW HIGGINS 
TAKE AN EIGHT TO SEVEN LEAD THE WELSH MAN 
SECURED THE LAST OF THE SESSION 
WITH A NEAR FLAWLESS BREAK OF NINETY THREE 
THEY ARE ALL AT EIGHT TO EIGHT AFTER AN 
ABSORBING AFTERNOON'S PLAY THIS 
AFTERNOON WE ALSO HAD THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
CHAMPION SHAUN MURPHY GETTING 
UNDER WAY AGAINST ALI CARTER IT 
WAS CAPTAIN CARTER FOR LEADING 
CONTROL SO FAR EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN BREAK IN THE 
FIRST SET HE HAS A SURPRISE SIX TO TWO 
ADVANTAGE THEY WILL RETURN IN THE 
MORNING MEANWHILE WE WILL RETURN 
TO THE ARENA AND TO DENNIS AND JOHN 
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT WAS A PLANT 
PLANT HE WILL SETTLE FOR IT 
IT WAS A MOST BIZARRE BREAK OFF 
SHOT HE HAS GOT DING JUNHUI IN A 
SPOT OF BOTHER OF HE IS LOOKING 
FOR A PASS TO THE RED WHICH IS ON 
THE LEFT OF THE BLACK IT IS NOT 
CLOSE TO THE CUSHION IT IS NOT 
EASY 
THAT IS WHAT HE IS LOOKING AT IF 
HE DOES NOT GET THIS ONE RIGHT 
A LONG STRAIGHT RED FOR STEPHEN 
HENDRY HE CAN GET BACK ON TO THE 
BLACK HE WILL TAKE IT ON YES THAT WAS A NICE POT 
IT IS AN AMAZING THING 
YOU CAN 
ALWAYS RELY ON HIM TO SCORE HEAVILY 
WHEN HE GETS AROUND THE BLACK 
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SAID ABOUT 
THE GAME OF SNOOKER BEING ABOUT 
CONFIDENCE STEPHEN CERTAINLY DID 
REGAIN A LOT OF HIS CONFIDENCE WITH 
THAT FANTASTIC RESULT AGAINST MARK 
ALLEN FROM NORTHERN IRELAND IT WAS 
VINTAGE STEPHEN HENDRY THE 
GENEROUS ODDS THAT WERE OFFERED 
BEFORE THIS YEAR'S CHAMPIONSHIPS 
THEY WERE FIFTY THREE ONE 
I BET THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE HAD AL FEW QUID ON THAT 
HE PLAYED FOR THAT RED TO THE RIGHT 
OF THE BLACK THE WHITE CAME OFF 
THE CUSHION A LITTLE BIT QUICKER 
THAN HE ANTICIPATED 
THAT IS WHERE HE WAS HOPING TO 
FINISH IT JUST CARRIED ON 
THIS TIME HE HAS HELD THE BLACK 
SPOT HE WAS PROBABLY WORRIED HE 
WAS GOING TO BOUNCE OFF THE TOP 
CUSHION 
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT HE WAS 
ALLOWING FOR THE BALL TO BOUNCE 
FAST OFF THE CUSHION IT DID NOT 
THAT TIME 
YOU CAN SEE HE IS JUST THE WRONG 
SIDE OF THE BLUE THE FACT THERE 
WAS A RED TO THE RIGHT OF THE BUNCH 
OF FIVE MEANT HE WAS O. K. 
THIS IS A 
GOOD INDICATION OF HOW WELL HE IS 
CUEING JUST ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE PINK 
STEPHEN WOULD NOT HAVE MINDED IF 
THEY HAD NOT BEEN ROOM FOR THE PINK 
ON THE PINK SPOT 
THIS TIME HE HAS A NICE ANGLE ON 
THE BLUE 
IF YOU WERE FORTY NINE POINTS BEHIND YOU 
WOULD HAVE PLAYED FOR THE BLACK ON 
THAT OCCASION TO GET IT BACK AT 
THIS END OF THE TABLE 
HE HAS NOT PLAYED THE BEST SHOT 
THERE IT IS AS IT HE HAS THE 
FEELING THAT THE TABLE IS PLAYING 
QUICKER DECEIVING BECAUSE HE HAS 
UNDERHIT A FEW POSITIONAL SHOTS 
QUICKER THIS EVENING 
AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT MISS WHEN YOU 
ARE IN AMONGST THE BALLS YOU CAN 
GET TO A GOOD SAFETY THAT IS WHAT 
STEPHEN HAS DONE KEEPING THE 
PRESSURE ON 
IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO HIT THE 
GREEN INTO EIGHTY TWO REDS ON THE SIDE 
CUSHION AND STILL GET THE STICKER 
THAT IS WHAT HE WOULD HAVE PLAYED 
STILL GET THE SNOOKER 
THE GREEN IS A BIT OF A 
DISADVANTAGE FOR DING BECAUSE THE 
RED TO THE RIGHT OF THE GREEN IT 
WILL NOT POT INTO THE CORNER POCKET 
WILL HE AND NESTLE ON THE TWO 
REDS TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE 
TABLE 
FOUL AND A MISS 
STEPHEN WILL HAVE TO THINK AGAIN 
BECAUSE THAT SHOT IS NOT ON 
BECAUSE THE BLUE IS IN THE WAY 
HE IS TRYING TO GET TO THE REDS 
NEAR THE GREEN 
IT IS A BETTER LINE 
IF THE GREEN WAS NOT THERE HE 
WOULD NOT BE PLAYING THE SHOT FOUL AND A MISS 
IT IS A TOUGH ANGLE TO PICK OUT 
BECAUSE OF IT IS DID SLIGHTLY FROM 
THE THIRD CUSHION IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO JUDGE IT FOUL AND A MISS 
WHEN YOU ASKED ME COULD LIKE THIS 
YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY ATTEMPTS AS IT 
TAKES WHEN YOU ARE UP SNOOKERED 
LIKE THIS 
HE HIT IT HARDER AND IT CAME OF THE 
FIRST CUSHION DIFFERENTLY 
I DO NOT 
THINK THAT THE ANGLE IS THERE NOW 
WELL PLAYED 
HE GOT IT IN THE END 
BUT HE GAVE TWENTY POINTS AWAY 
THAT IS A MISTAKE WHEN YOU PLAYED 
THAT SHOT YOU CANNOT MAKE CONTACT 
WITH THE BALL ON THE BAULK LINE 
IF THE WHITE GOES CLOSER TO THE 
CUSHION THAN HE WANTED BUT THAT IS 
VINTAGE STEPHEN HENDRY THAT SHOT A LONG WAY OUT WITH THAT ONE 
HE DID NOT QUITE GET THROUGH THAT 
AS HE INTENDED LOOKING TO SEE IT 
THE ANGLE WAS THERE TO POT THE 
GREEN AND FLICK THE RED 
HE DID WELL THAT WAS ABOUT THE 
BEST HE COULD DO FROM THAT 
SITUATION IF HE DOES CUT THIS RED 
IN THERE IS A POSSIBILITY HE COULD 
FINISH ON THE BLACK HE NEEDS TO 
PLAY IT WITH A TRACE OF SIDE 
OTHERWISE HE WOULD CANNON INTO THE 
TWO REDS 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE BLUE BUT I 
THINK THE BLACK MIGHT GIVE HIM THE 
BETTER OPTION TO COME CALLED THE 
REDS JUST ABOVE THE GREEN WITH IT 
BEING A THINNER POT IT IS HARD TO 
CONTROL THE CUE BALL 
HE WAS UNLUCKY A VERY ATTACKING 
SHOT 
YOU SAY UNLUCKY BUT IT NEVER SHOT LOOKED ON TO ME L. THINK THE PINK WAS JUST IN THE LINE THAT HE WANTED 
HE CAUGHT THE RED IT TOO THIN BUT 
IT IS NOT BAD L. DO NOT THINK THAT 
HE CAN GET THROUGH TO THE POTTING 
ANGLE PAST THE PINK IT IS TIGHT 
JUST A CONTAINING SAFETY SHOT THIS LOOKS PRETTY GOOD JUST ANOTHER FRACTION AND HE WOULD HAVE HAD THE SNOOKER 
THE MAIN PRIORITY FOR STEPHEN WAS 
NOT TO DISTURB THE TWO REDS ON THE 
RIGHT HAND CUSHION 
THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THAT 
POT IT WAS CLOSED BUT NOT CLOSE ENOUGH 
DING CAN SEE ENOUGH OF THE RED TO 
PLAY THE POT 
HE HAS AN ANGLE ON THE GREEN TO 
DEVELOP THE REDS IF THIS WORKS OUT 
HE COULD GIVE HIMSELF A CHANCE THE DREADED DOUBLE KISS 
HE COULD NOT DO A LOT ELSE REALLY 
HE COULD NOT GET BACK TO THE BAULK 
END WITHOUT PLAYING A RISKY SHOT 
STEPHEN WAS TRYING TO KNOCK THE 
BLACK SAFE THERE THIS IS THE FIRST 
TIME THAT DING HAS PLAYED THREE 
SESSION BEST OF TWENTY FIVE FRAMES 
YES IT 
IS HIS FIRST TIME IN THE SECOND 
ROUND 
THERE IS NO NEED TO PANIC JUST YET 
IF HE COULD SOMEHOW GET THIS FRAME 
THERE WAS NO REAL EASY SAFETY SHOT 
THERE AND THAT WAS A VERY GOOD POT 
THE GREEN IT WOULD GET HIM ON TO 
THE LAST RED BUT HE HAS TO GO ALL 
THE WAY AROUND THE TABLE AGAIN A BIT TOO PACY 
IT IS QUITE A COMFORTABLE SWERVE TO 
GET AROUND THE GREEN HERE BUT 
YOU'RE NEVER SURE WHERE THEY ARE 
GOING TO GO 
THAT IS A HELP FOR STEPHEN THE 
BLUE GOING ON THE SIDE CUSHION IT 
WAS ALREADY GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT 
CHANCE BECAUSE THE GREEN WILL NOT 
GO IN ITS NORMAL POCKET WITH THE 
BLACK BEING THERE 
HE HAS AN ANGLE TO GET TO THE 
YELLOW 
HE HAS TO PLAY THIS WITH BIT OF SIDE AND SCREW HE DID NOT WANT THE CANNON ON THE BLUE 
I DID NOT KNOW IF HE COULD HIT THIS 
FULL BALL AND TRIED TO GET THE 
SNOOKER A BIT TOO PACY 
JUST NINE N. T. S. 
IN IT BUT FRAME IN THE BALANCE STEPHEN HENDRY WANTS TO HAVE GO AT THIS YELLOW 
GREAT POT A TERRIFIC SHOT THAT 
REALLY IS VINTAGE STEPHEN HENDRY 
EIGHTEEN POINTS THE LEAD AND EIGHTEEN 
REMAINING JUST THE BLUE REQUIRED 
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT FRAME BALL 
MISSED 
HOW CAN HE POT THE YELLOW MISSED LIKE THE ONE THAT HE DID AND THEN 
MISSED THE BLUE HE WAS STRETCHING 
A LITTLE BIT BUT IT WAS A 
COMFORTABLE POT 
THAT IS THE WRONG SHOT THAT IS THE 
INEXPERIENCE OF YOUTH THERE THE 
ONE THING YOU MUST DO IS GET THE 
OBJECT BALL SAFE HE DID NOT NEED A 
SNOOKER HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT 
THERE IS A WAY AROUND THE TABLE TO 
GET IN BEHIND THE PINK AND BLACK 
BUT HE HAS TO KEEP THE BLUE SAFE 
AND HE HAS LEFT IT IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE TABLE SOMEWHAT AGAIN 
THE WHITE WAS NOT FAR OFF GOING 
INTO THE POCKET SO HE DID NOT CUE 
THAT VERY WELL SO CLOSE JUST KEEPING IT TIGHT 
I THINK HE HAS JUST ABOUT GOT THE 
SNOOKER IT WAS A RISKY SHOT BUT IT 
IS SAFE 
ONCE AGAIN HE HAS NEARLY GONE IN 
OFF WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT WOULD 
MAKE IF HE DID BECAUSE DING COULD 
WIN WITH THE THREE REMAINING 
COLOURS
