CITY HALL AND WEAK NUMBER ONE OF 
THE BORIS JOHNSON MAYORALTY AS 
VIEWED BY HIS NEW YORK COUNTERPART ALL 
AFTER THE NEWS 
THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON BURMA IS 
FACING AN UNIMAGINABLE TRAGEDY AND 
LESS AID TO CYCLONE VICTIMS IS 
DELIVERED QUICKLY THE WARNING FROM 
THE INTERNATIONAL WAS TWO COMMITTEE 
CAME AFTER THE UNITED NATIONS 
ESTIMATED THAT ONLY A QUARTER OF 
THE SURVIVORS HAD RECEIVED AID SO 
FAR OUR CORRESPONDENT NOW FROM 
THAILAND THAILAND BURMESE STATE TELEVISION SHOWS OFF 
A CAMP FOR VICTIMS OF THE CYCLONE 
THE PRIME MINISTER AND PARTY 
ARRIVED 
THE MILITARY REGIME IS ARRIVED DETERMINED TO SHOW IT HAS GOT THE 
SITUATION UNDER CONTROL BUT IT 
DOESN'T AT THE AIRPORT STILL NO 
SIGN OF A FORKLIFT TRUCK EVEN BUT 
AT LEAST FOREIGN AID IS NOW BEING 
ALLOWED IN A LITTLE BIT MORE 
QUICKLY AND THERE ARE SOME SIGNS 
THAT BURMA'S ISOLATED LEADERS ARE 
BEGINNING TO OPEN THINGS UP A A PLANE HAS BEEN UNLOADED FROM U. N. H. C. R. 
THIS MORNING AND WE UNLOADED FOUR 
TRUCKLOADS OF TENTS AND PLASTIC 
SHEETING AND COOKING KITS AND WE 
HAVE SENT THOSE ALREADY OUT TO THE 
DELTA THIS MORNING 
BUT THE NEWS 
FROM THE FLOODED IRRAWADDY DELTA IS 
GRIM NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH AID IS 
GETTING THROUGH AFTER MORE THAN A 
WEEK DEHYDRATION AND DISEASE ARE 
GAINING THE UPPER HAND 
WE ALREADY 
HAVE INFORMATION THAT THERE ARE 
DYING CASES BEING REPORTED CHOLERA 
IS A MATTER OF TIME AND IT CAN 
HAPPEN AT ANY TIME AS THE CLEAR UP 
CONTINUES IN RANGOON BURMA'S 
LEADERS SEEM DETERMINED TO DEAL 
WITH THE AFTERMATH OF THIS DISASTER 
ON THEIR OWN TERMS WHATEVER THE 
RISKS TO THE SURVIVORS 
THE FORMER DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER 
JOHN PRESCOTT CLAIMS HE URGED TONY 
BLAIR TO SACK GORDON BROWN BUT 
ADDED IN HIS NAME WAS THAT MR. BLAIR 
WAS SCARED OF HIS CHANCELLOR MR. 
PRESCOTT SUGGESTS THAT MR. BLAIR 
FREQUENTLY WENT BACK ON PROMISES TO 
STEP DOWN TO ALLOW GORDON BROWN TO 
TAKE OVER AS PRIME MINISTER THE 
B. B. C. HAS LEARNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
IS TO ISSUE A STARK WARNING ABOUT 
THE LACK OF MONEY IN THE CARE 
SYSTEM FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED 
PEOPLE IN ENGLAND MINISTERS IS SHARED BY MANY AND 
THINGS ARE SET TO GET WORSE AS THE 
AGEING POPULATION MEANS MORE OF US 
NEED LOOKING AFTER MANY PEOPLE 
ASSUME THAT SOCIAL CARE IS LIKE 
MEDICAL CARE FREE WHEN YOU NEED IT 
BUT IT'S NOT WHEN WE COME TO NEED 
HELP WITH THINGS LIKE WASHING 
DRESSING EATING STATE SUPPORT IS 
MEANS TESTED MOST PEOPLE HAVE TO 
ASKING HOW THE STATE FAMILIES AND 
TAXPAYERS SHOULD SHARE THE COSTS OF 
THIS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT SERVICE 
PRAYERS HAVE BEEN SAID THIS MORNING 
AT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN SOUTH 
LONDON WHERE A TEENAGER WAS 
MURDERED WHO WAS MURDERED 
YESTERDAY HAD BEEN AN ALTAR BOY 
JIMMY MIZEN WHO WAS SIXTEEN ON FRIDAY 
WAS ATTACKED BY ANOTHER YOUTH AT A 
BAKER'S IN LEWISHAM POLICE ARE 
APPEALING FOR WITNESSES THAT IS 
THE NEWS SO FAR BACK TO YOU JOHN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE OF THE 
MINOR MIRACLES AFTER THE TSUNAMI 
WAS THAT THERE WAS NO OUTBREAK OF 
TIME LLOYD CHOLERA OR DENGUE FEVER 
THAT WAS BECAUSE THE WORLD 
RESPONDED TYPHOID THE AID 
AGENCIES QUINTIN IN FORCE AND THE 
GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE REGION 
REALISED THEY COULD NOT HANDLE IT 
BY THEMSELVES THE AID AGENCIES 
WENT BEEN IN FORCE SO WHAT SHOULD 
THE WEST DO L. AM JOINED FROM HIS 
CONSTITUENCY BY THE FOREIGN 
SECRETARY DAVID MILIBAND THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US 
CAN YOU GIVE US YOUR ASSESSMENT OF 
THE LATEST FIGURES THAT YOU'RE 
GETTING ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO 
MAY HAVE DIED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
WHO NEED HELP 
GOOD AFTERNOON THE MESSAGE THAT 
HAS COME BACK FROM RANGOON FROM 
OUR OWN AMBASSADOR THERE TO DOUGLAS 
ALEXANDER AND TO MYSELF OVERNIGHT 
PAINTS A VERY GRIM PICTURE BATTY'S 
THAT I WOULD BE AMAZED IF THERE 
HAVE NOT BEEN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE DIED ALREADY ALTHOUGH I 
DO NOT THINK THAT FIGURE IS 
CONFIRMED THAT IS THAT WHAT'S 
MORE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE 
ARE AT RISK AND NATURAL DISASTER 
IS TURNING INTO A A HUMANITARIAN 
CATASTROPHE OF GENUINELY EPIC 
PROPORTIONS THIS IS INSIGNIFICANT 
PART DUE TO WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE 
AS THE MALIGN NEGLECT OF THE REGIME 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REPORT TO YOUR 
VIEWERS THAT THERE IS ONE OTHER 
ASPECT OF THE REPORT FROM THE 
AMBASSADOR OVERNIGHT WHICH IS 
IMPORTANT WHICH YOU WILL HAVE SEEN 
IN THE CLIPS OF AID ARRIVING AT THE 
AIRPORT TODAY AND THAT IS THAT 
THERE IS CLEARLY SOME INTERNATIONAL 
AID NOW BEING ACCEPTED SOME VISAS 
HAVE BEEN ISSUED WHICH IS 
IMPORTANT AND ALSO THE AMBASSADOR 
REPORTS THAT DRUGS ARE NOW HEADING 
SOUTH FROM RANGOON TO TRY TO GET TO 
THE MOST DEVASTATED AREAS THE UN 
REPORTS THAT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE 
ARE GETTING THE HELP THAT THEY NEED 
IF IT'S UP TO THAT NUMBER THEN IT 
HAS CLEARLY RISEN OVER THE LAST THIRTY SIX 
FORTY EIGHT HOURS BUT THE BASIC POINT IS 
THAT THE SCALE OF THE RESPONSE 
INSIDE THE COUNTRY IN COMPARISON 
TO THE SCALE OF THE DISASTER IS 
INADEQUATE 
UNTIL NOW THERE SEEMS INADEQUATE TO HAVE BEEN A RETICENCE ON THE 
PART OF THIS GOVERNMENT TO 
CRITICISE THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES 
MAY BE MAKING THE CALCULATION THAT 
FRANKLY THAT WOULD HELP THE AID 
FLOW MORE QUICKLY 
NO I THINK 
THAT DOUGLAS ALEXANDER AND MYSELF 
AND THE PRIME MINISTER HAD SPOKEN 
PLAINLY ABOUT THIS WE HAVE BEEN 
CLEAR THAT WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN 
POLITICAL GAIN WE'RE INTERESTED IN 
SAVING LIVES IT IS A HUMANITARIAN 
ISSUE IRONICALLY IT HAS BEEN THE 
GOVERNMENT IN RANGOON THAT HAS 
PURSUED THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
REFERENDUM WHICH WAS HELD BIZARRELY 
YESTERDAY I THINK THAT WE HAVE 
SPOKEN FRANKLY AND CLEARLY WE HAVE 
BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST TO PLEDGE AID 
UP TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST 
SLICE AND THEN MORE AS NECESSARY 
WE HAVE HUGE EXPERTISE IN THIS 
COUNTRY THROUGH ORGANISATIONS LIKE 
SAVE THE CHILDREN WHO WERE ON THE 
GROUND THERE AND WITH WHOM WE WORK 
CLOSELY AND WE ARE VERY ACTIVE AT 
THE UN AS WELL THERE IS A VERY 
CLEAR MESSAGE BUT IT IS ONLY BEING 
DIMLY HEARD WITHIN THE COUNTRY IT 
SEEMS 
IF SOMEONE IS AT HOME SEEMS LISTENING TO THIS INTERVIEW WITH 
YOU AND YOU ARE DESCRIBING THE 
DESPERATE SITUATION THERE BUT ALSO 
THE RELUCTANCE OF THE REGIME TO 
HELP WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU PART 
WITH YOUR MONEY TO HELP THE 
SITUATION IF YOU'RE NOT SURE THAT 
THE MONEY YOU GIVE IS GOING TO BE 
TURNED INTO MOSQUITO NETS WHICH 
WILL GET TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED 
THEM 
I WANT TO ADDRESS THAT VERY THEM DIRECTLY ANYONE WHO HAS GIVEN 
MONEY IN BRITAIN CAN BE SURE THAT 
IT WILL BE PROPERLY USED BECAUSE 
IT WILL NOT BE GOING INTO THE 
REGIME'S MILITARY COFFERS OUR AID 
IS CHANNELLED THROUGH ORGANISATIONS 
LIKE SAVE THE CHILDREN WHO RIGHTLY 
HAVE A VERY HIGH REPUTATION AND I 
THINK THAT THIS IS WHY THERE IS 
THIS VERY IMPORTANT NEXT THIRTY SIX HOURS 
I MEAN THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN DAYS 
HAVE BEEN REALLY INEXPRESSIBLE I 
THINK THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD HAVE 
TAKEN SO LONG YOU RIGHTLY DREW THE 
COMPARISON WITH THE TSUNAMI AND 
THE RESPONSE THEN BUT IN THAT CASE 
THE GOVERNMENT WELCOMED THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BUT WE ARE 
CLEAR THAT OUR AID WILL GO WHEN IT 
IS ABLE TO DO GOOD 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
ARGUMENT THAT SAYS WIRE NETTING A 
HANDFUL OF GENERALS STOP AN AID 
EFFORT TO A POPULATION WHICH MAY BE 
STARVING AND AT RISK OF DISEASE 
WHY ARE YOU LETTING 
THE SIMPLE 
ANSWER IS THAT ALL THE DEVELOPMENT 
EXPERTS SAY THAT THAT IS NOT A VERY 
EFFECTIVE WAY OF DELIVERING AID IT 
MAY BE THE LAST RESORT BUT ALL OF 
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REAL EXPERTS IN 
THIS AREA HUMANITARIAN FIGHTERS 
WHOM IGHTERS IS THE WRONG WORD 
WHOM FIGHTERS IS THE WRONG WORD AID EXPERTS THEY'RE MAKING 
IT CLEAR THAT THAT IS THE FOURTH OR 
FIFTH OR SIXTH BEST SOLUTION IT IS A 
LAST RESORT WHAT COUNTS IS TO TRY 
TO GET THE KIND OF MOVEMENT WHICH 
WE HAVE SEEN OF TRUCKS AND 
AEROPLANES DELIVERING A SKEETER 
NETS FOOD RICE ALSO TENTS TO 
PROVIDE SOME SHELTER MOSQUITO 
NETS AND BASIC MEDICAL EQUIPMENT 
BUT THAT MANY PEOPLE AS WELL AS 
MATERIAL 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE MATERIAL WOULD LIKE YOU TO STAY WITH US 
BECAUSE IN A MOMENT WE WOULD LIKE 
TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEMS OF POLITICS 
CLOSER TO HOME BECAUSE THIS WEEK 
GORDON BROWN WILL GIVE US A SNEAK 
PREVIEW OF WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS 
GOING TO BRING FORWARD IN THE 
QUEEN'S SPEECH THERE WILL BE NO 
USE OF THE WORD WE LAUNCHED BUT 
MOST PEOPLE AGREE THAT THAT IS 
ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT IS NO USE OF 
THE WORD RE LAUNCH SO HOW DOES 
GORDON BROWN ACHIEVE LIFT OFF 
T. MINUS FIFTEEN SECONDS TWELVE ELEVEN TEN 
GORDON BROWN IN DIRE NEED OF A RE 
LAUNCH IF ONLY IT WAS AS EASY AS 
FLINGING HIM INTO OUTER SPACE WITH 
A FEW TRUCKLOADS OF LIQUID OXYGEN 
THE LAUNCH TEAM WISHES YOU GOOD 
LUCK AND GODSPEED LIFT OFF WE HAVE LIFT OFF 
IMPORTANT VOICES IN THE LABOUR 
PARTY WANT GORDON BROWN TO GO 
FURTHER AND TO GO BOLDLY 
GORDON BROWN CAME INTO POLITICS TO 
REDUCE POVERTY HE HAS PROMISED TO 
END CHILD POVERTY HE HAS GOT 
GOOD RECORD ON IT BUT THIS IS HIS 
CHANCE TO REALLY DO IT WHETHER HE 
WINS OR LOSES THE NEXT GENERAL 
ELECTION I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE 
WOULD WANT TO SAY HE DID AS PRIME 
MINISTER IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO TAKE 
SOME RISKS THE THINGS THAT YOU 
WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO DO ARE NOW 
THINGS YOU STRATEGICALLY CANNOT 
AFFORD NOT TO DO 
RE LAUNCHES CAN 
GO BADLY WRONG 
TIME TO GET BACK 
TO BASICS 
MAJOR JOHN HAD REAL 
PROBLEMS ESCAPING POLITICAL GRAVITY 
UT UP OR SHUT UP LISTEN TO 
HIS FORMER PRESS SECRETARY 
IT WAS 
FAIRLY DEPRESSING BECAUSE YOU WOULD 
HAVE THESE PLANS TO GO ON SOME 
REGIONAL TOURS TO LOOK AT 
ORGANISATIONS AND BUSINESSES THAT 
HAD BENEFITED FROM GOVERNMENT 
POLICIES BUT IT ONLY TOOK ONE 
INDIVIDUAL ONE NONENTITY TO SAY 
SOMETHING OR DO SOMETHING SILLY 
FOR THAT TO ABSOLUTELY DOMINATE THE 
NEWS AGENDA AND OF COURSE WE'RE 
GETTING THAT NOW WITH GORDON BROWN 
AS WELL 
POLICY IS HOW MR. BROWN THINKS HE 
SHOULD TRY TO BREAK AWAY FROM 
ALTITUDE ZERO FIRST BY JUNKING 
SOME OF THE REALLY HEAVY STUFF 
THERE WILL BE A STATEMENT ON THE 
TEN P. TAX BAND EARLY NEXT WEEK THEN 
ON WEDNESDAY WE CAN EXPECT TO HEAR 
ABOUT THE QUEEN'S SPEECH AND 
FUTURE LEGISLATION GORDON MIGHT 
LAUNCH HIS STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH 
THE HOUSING PROBLEM GETTING TOUGH 
WITH OUR DEGENERATE LAWLESS 
SOCIETY IS USUALLY POPULAR WITH 
OLDER VOTERS AND OF COURSE THERE 
IS OUR OLD FAVOURITE WELFARE 
REFORM 
EVEN THE MAN WHO PILOTED COMMANDER 
BROWN'S LEADERSHIP ELECTION LAST 
YEAR WANTS HIM TO RISE BY AS THE 
NOISE AND FUSS OF DAILY POLITICS 
TO RISE ABOVE 
ACTUALLY ANOTHER 
WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM IS TO JUST 
NOT CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THE 
WESTMINSTER FROTH AND ALL THE SORT 
OF SPECULATION JUST YOU KNOW 
HAS HE BEEN CARING TOO MUCH I I THINK DISMISSING SOME OF THE 
BRICKBATS AND SLINGS AND ARROWS 
JUST GET ON WITH THE JOB AND 
ABSOLUTELY TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU CARE 
ABOUT REGARDLESS ABOUT WHAT GETS 
THROWN AROUND STAY FOCUSED KEEP 
ON YOUR MESSAGE AND BE BOLD NOW 
IS A TIME FOR THAT 
GORDON BROWN'S 
MISSION IS TO GET BACK INTO THE 
STRATOSPHERE AND THEN LAND SAFELY 
IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TEN READY FOR RE 
ELECTION 
THE COUNTDOWN HAS BEGUN THE FOREIGN SECRETARY IS STILL WITH 
US DAVID MILIBAND I DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER TO START WITH POLITICAL 
MEMOIRS TEN P. TAX BAND GORDON 
BROWN'S GENERAL PERFORMANCE SHEILA 
GUNN IS RIGHT YOU ARE IN A 
POSITION WHERE YOU CAN'T GET 
ANYTHING POSITIVE ACROSS 
I DON'T 
ACCEPT THAT CONGRATULATIONS TO THE 
B. B. C. GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT A BIT OF 
STAR TREK TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO 
ONE HAS GONE BEFORE CHRIS LESLIE 
SAID WE NEED TO GET ON WITH THE JOB 
WHAT IS IMPORTANT OVER THE LAST 
FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS THERE'S 
OBVIOUSLY BEEN A LOT OF POLITICAL 
CHATTER BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED ON 
THE GROUND CRIME FIGURES WHICH 
SHOW YOU ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE A 
VICTIM OF CRIME SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE 
EMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY IS 
HIGHER THAN EVER BEFORE N. H. S. 
FIGURES WHICH SHOW MARKED 
IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF CARE 
AND NEW PLANS FROM ALAN JOHNSON TO 
OPEN UP THE G. P. SERVICES L. THINK 
WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THE 
CURRENT PERIOD IN POLITICS IS NO 
ONE IS ACTUALLY SAYING THAT THE 
NEXT STEPS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS 
POSING ARE WRONG IN RESPECT OF 
CRIME WE ARE ROLLING OUT 
NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING IN EVERY 
WARD IN THE COUNTRY L. SAW THAT IN 
CREWE FOR MYSELF ON WEDNESDAY NO 
ONE IS SAYING THAT IS THE WRONG TO 
THING IN RESPECT OF THE ECONOMY 
NO ONE IS SAYING THAT ALISTAIR 
DARLING'S MOVES TO ENSURE THERE IS 
ENOUGH MONEY IN THE BANKING SECTOR 
SO PEOPLE CAN GET MORTGAGES NO ONE 
IS SAYING THAT IS WRONG IT'S QUITE 
DIFFERENT FROM THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHICH YOU 
AND I CAN REMEMBER THE 
CONSERVATIVES RAN OUT OF STEAM 
THEY FACED A CLEAR AND DETERMINE 
I'D LOGICAL ALTERNATIVE THIS 
GOVERNMENT IS PURSUING POLICIES 
NO ONE IS SAYING THAT THEY'RE WRONG 
AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE 
LET ME 
INTERRUPT ONE OF GORDON BROWN'S 
KEY MESSAGES LAST WEEK YOU NEEDED 
TO COMMUNICATE MORE EFFECTIVELY 
WITH THE ELECTORATE TO GET YOUR 
MESSAGE ACROSS WHEN WENDY 
ALEXANDER SAYS WE WANT A REFERENDUM 
GORDON BROWN STANDS UP IN THE HOUSE 
OF COMMONS AND SAYS NO THAT IS NOT 
WHAT SHE SAID NOW ARE PEOPLE 
STUPID STUPID NO PEOPLE ARE NOT STUPID AT ALL 
WHAT WENDY ALEX ANDER WAS EXPOSING 
WAS THE HYPOCRISY OF THE SCOTTISH 
NATIONAL PARTY WHO SAY THEY WANT A 
REFERENDUM TO ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE 
FOR SCOTLAND BUT TRYING TO PUT IT 
OFF TO KEEP THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND 
WAITING GORDON BROWN SAID THERE IS 
A REVIEW HE WAS SPEAKING AS U. K. 
PRIME MINISTER THERE IS REVIEW 
GOING ON LED 
DON'T YOU NEED TO 
TREAT PEOPLE MORE INTELLIGENTLY 
WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT THERE WAS A 
DIFFERENCE OF VIEW RATHER THAN 
TRYING TO SAY IT WASN'T WHAT SHE 
SAID PEOPLE THINK THAT IS NOT 
BEING HONEST WITH US 
I'M JUST 
TRYING TO EXPLAIN THEY'RE DOING 
DIFFERENT JOBS WENDY ALEXANDER IS 
THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR OPPOSITION 
IN SCOTLAND SHE'S RESPONDING TO 
THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY WHICH 
IS TRYING TO DANGLE THE PROSPECT OF 
SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE IN TWO OR 
THREE YEARS' TIME SHE THINKS THAT 
IS KEEPING THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE 
WAITING WHEN THERE ARE MORE 
IMPORTANT THINGS GORDON BROWN AS 
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER IS SETTING 
OUT VERY CLEARLY THAT THE LABOUR 
PARTY IS A UNIONIST PARTY WE 
BELIEVE IN THE UNION WE THINK THAT 
SCOTLAND WALES AND NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND ENGLAND ARE STRONGER 
TOGETHER THAN BEING APART ANOTHER ANOTHER PIECE OF HONEST COMMUNICATIONS 
JOHN PRESCOTT SAID THAT GORDON 
BROWN IS FRUSTRATING ANNOYING 
BEWILDERING AND PRICKRY AND COULD 
GO OFF LIKE A BLOODY VOLCANO IS 
THAT THE GORDON YOU KNOW 
NO L. 
DON'T DO BOOK REVIEWS L. HAVEN'T 
READ JOHN PRESCOTT'S BOOK L. WORK 
WITH GORDON BROWN MOST DAYS OF THE 
WEEK HE IS PASSIONATE ABOUT THE 
VALUES HE BELIEVES IN HE IS CLEAR 
ABOUT THE GOALS WE ARE PURSUING AS 
HE SAID LAST WEEK HE GETS INTO THE 
DETAIL BUT THAT IS IMPORTANT YOU 
NEED A PRIME MINISTER WHO IS ABLE 
TO HAVE COMMAND OF THE DETAIL AS 
WELL AS THE BIGGER PICTURE SO I 
DON'T RECOGNISE THE PORTRAIT THAT 
JOHN PRESCOTT HAS SET OUT THAT'S 
WHY I THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO 
GET ON WITH THE JOB WHAT IS FATAL 
IN POLITICS IS IF YOU FORGET WHAT 
YOU ARE MEANT TO BE DOING WHICH IS 
WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO 
ELECT THE YOU 
DAVID MILIBAND 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
GORDON BROWN HAS CAUGHT THE 
ATTENTION OF OUR RESIDENT 
CARTOONIST GARY BARKER THIS WEEK 
YOU CAN SEE MORE FROM GARY AT 
B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U. K. SLASH POLITICSSHOW BBCCO.UK SLASH POLITICSSHOW M. P.S' EXPENSES WERE BACK IN THE 
HEADLINES THIS WEEK AS PARLIAMENT 
CHALLENGED A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION 
ACT RULING SHE SHOULD DISCLOSE 
EVERYTHING THE ROW ABOUT HOW MUCH 
MONEY RECEIVE IN TERMS OF SALARY 
AND EXPENSES HAS BEEN RUMBLING EVER 
SINCE IT WAS REVEALED THAT A 
CONSERVATIVE M. P. DEREK CONWAY WAS 
USING HIS OFFICE ALLOWANCE TO PAY 
HIS TEENAGE SON WELL THE COMMONS 
HAS ITS OWN INQUIRY INTO HOW TO 
REFORM THE SYSTEM BUT WE HERE AT 
THE POLITICS SHOW LIKE TO GIVE THE 
POLITICIANS A RUN FOR OUR MONEY 
WE'VE ASKED THREE OF OUR VIEWERS TO 
DO THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION STEP 
FORWARD JUDE BOB AND MARGARET 
A POLITICS SHOW PANEL ON A QUEST 
THEY'RE DOING THEIR OWN REVIEW ON 
M. P.S' PAY AND PERKS THEY'RE FINDING 
OUT WHAT AN M. P. IS REALLY WORTH AND 
IF WE GET VALUE FOR MONEY 
AT THE END OF TWO WEEKS WITH THE 
HELP OF EXPERTS AND POLITICIANS 
THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME 
ANSWERS 
FIRST UP IT'S MARGARET BUTLER A 
GRANNY FROM WALES WHO HELPS OUT IN 
HER DAUGHTER'S SHOP SHE CAN'T WAIT 
TO ASK THE HARD QUESTIONS 
PARTY POLITICS WILL HAVE NO PART IN 
MY IDEAS OR PROPOSALS ON THIS 
MATTER I WANT TO KNOW WHY I 
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM LOTS OF M. P.'S 
ABOUT THE RANGE OF EXPENSES SHE CAN 
CLAIM CLAIM NEXT BOB PITMAN A BUSINESSMAN 
FROM HAMPSHIRE A SELF CONFESSED 
IDEALIST HE HAS PROMISED TO BE 
PAXMAN ON STEROIDS 
I THINK M. P.'S HAVE THEIR SNOUTS 
WEDGED FIRMLY IN THE PAY AND 
EXPENSES TROUGH ARE THEY GIVING US 
VALUE FOR MONEY L. DON'T KNOW 
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING FIND OUT 
AND FROM HARROGATE WORKING MUM 
JUDE PALMER A SAVVY MEDIA 
CONSULTANT IT'S NOT BRAIN SURGERY 
SHE SAYS 
THE CURRENT REVIEW ON M. P.S' PAY AND 
EXPENSES REPRESENTS A GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY TACKLE THE 
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF VOTER 
CONFIDENCE 
THEY HAVE JUST TWO WEEKS TO 
COMPLETE THEIR MISSION DO THEY 
HAVE ENOUGH TIME THEY PLAN TO MAKE 
THEIR OWN RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE 
THEY BITTEN OFF MORE THAN THEY CAN 
CHEW CHEW FIRST EXPERT STEPHEN MANS WORTH 
IT'S HIS JOB TO KNOW SOMEONE'S 
WORTH M. P.'S GET SIXTY THOUSAND A YEAR THEY 
CAN CLAIM EXTRA FOR EXPENSES THAT 
IS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
IF YOU TAKE THEIR ASE 
LEVEL OF PAY I THINK THERE IS AN 
ARGUMENT TO SAY THAT IS BELOW WHAT 
IT SHOULD BE 
COMPARED TO COMPARED COMPARED TO PEOPLE IN MAINSTREAM CORPORATE 
STRUCTURES IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
ALLOWANCES THAT GO ON TOP OF THAT 
THAT IS QUITE HEAVY DISTRACTION 
BECAUSE THE NINETY THOUSAND THAT IS A 
PROVISION FOR STAFF IN COMPANY WOULD BE PAID FOR IN COMPANY 
CHURCH IT'S A SACRED PLACE THEY 
SHOULD BE LIKE VICKERS WITH 
VOCATIONS RATHER THAN CAPTAINS OF 
INDUSTRY 
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT INDUSTRY POINT WHEN YOU PUT EGGS TOGETHER 
TO MAKE SCRAMBLED EGGS BEFORE YOU 
COOK IT YOU HAVE THE YOLK BROKEN 
INTO THE WHITE THAT IS EGO TIM 
WITH PUBLIC SERVICE YOU CAN'T 
SEPARATE THE TWO YOU NEED BOTH TO 
PRODUCE THE SAME SORT OF PEOPLE WHO 
ARE AGGRESSIVE AND DO THE JOBS 
THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO 
DELIVER AGAINST OBJECTIVES YOU 
HAVE TO CREATE A CORRELATION 
BETWEEN THE TWO 
WHAT CAN M. P.'S CLAIM 
ON EXPENSES EXPERT NUMBER TWO 
CAMPAIGNER HEATHER BROOKE FORCED 
SOME DETAILS TO BE MADE PUBLIC 
UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION 
ACT DUBBED THE JOHN LEWIS LIST 
M. P.'S CLAIMED ANYTHING FROM MORTGAGES 
TO FURNITURE TO NEW KITCHENS DO DO YOU THINK IS THERE A RELUCTANCE 
FROM M. P.'S TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY AND 
CLOSURE 
DEFINITELY THE FACT I CLOSURE HAVE FOUGHT FOR THREE YEARS TO GET 
THIS MINIMAL AMOUNT OF 
ACCOUNTABILITY OUT OF THEM SPEAKS 
VOLUMES ABOUT THEIR 
MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT DEMOCRACY 
THE PURPOSE OF IT 
IN THE STATES 
THE FLOW OF INFORMATION MORE EASILY 
ACCESSIBLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC 
IN AMERICA THEY HAD A FEDERAL 
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT SINCE 
NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN I ASKED FOR A BASIC THINGS 
M. P.S' EXPENSES IT'S A GIVEN IN A 
LOT OF COUNTRIES YOU WOULDN'T HAVE 
A BATTLE OVER IT I'M NOT ASKING 
FOR THEIR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT 
EXPERT NUMBER THREE FORMER SUN 
EDITOR FAMOUS FOR THE HEADLINE 
FREDDIE STAR ATE MY HAMSTER IT'S 
KELVIN MCKENZIE 
WHAT IS THE 
MEDIA'S ANGLE ON THIS WHERE ARE 
THEY COMING FROM 
MOST NEWSPAPER 
READERS DISLIKE THEIR M. P.'S AND 
PEOPLE IN POWER IN POLITICS WHO 
ARE SPENDING THEIR MONEY THEREFORE 
ANY EXAMPLES WE GET OF CROOKRY 
FRAUD SHAM CROOKRY OR SPENDING 
MONEY IN A WAY WHICH KNOW READER 
COULD GET AWAY WITH WOULD BE 
POUNCED ON AND USED TO BASH THEM 
FIRMLY OVER THE HEAD 
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE M. P.'S THAT 
TRANSPARENCY IS AN UNLOVELY 
INTRUSION 
IN ANY NORMAL COMPANY INTRUSION COMMERCIAL COMPANY YOU PRODUCE 
YOUR EXPENSES AND PRODUCE RECEIPTS 
WITH IT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NORMAL 
WHY WOULDN'T M. P.'S CONSIDER THAT 
IF GOOD ENOUGH FOR CONSTITUENTS 
WHY ISN'T IT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM 
FRANKLY IDEA THAT THERE IS SOME 
KIND OF INTRUSION THESE GUYS MAKE 
SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR IT'S BASICALLY A 
WORKING YEAR LESS THAN EVEN THE 
TEACHERS THEY HAVEN'T GOT IT TOUGH 
WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE SOME KIND 
OF SOME KIND OF COMFORT ZONE WHERE 
THEY KNOW THEY WON'T BE NAILED TO 
THE CROSS FOR HAVING CLAIMED TOO 
MANY TOILET ROLLS 
BUT BASICALLY 
IF THEY ARE SWINDLING WHICH I 
CONSIDER SOME ASPECTS OF THE WAY 
THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES AS 
STRAIGHTFORWARD FRAUD AND THAT IF 
YOU WORK FOR A PRIVATE COMPANY BY 
THE WAY BOOM OUT THE DOOR 
WE'VE GOT TO FIND A COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN OURSELVES 
WEEK ONE IS OVER 
THEY'VE HEARD FROM THE EXPERTS 
IT'S BRAIN STORMING TIME EXPENSES EXPENSES ARE A PROBLEM 
WE NEED TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT 
EXPENSES ARE 
THE ROOT OF ALL AWFUL 
CAN THEY 
AGREE 
A ROOT AND BRANCH REVIEW AGREE THAT WAS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE 
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT YES 
THIS IS ALL ABOUT TRANSPARENCY YOU YOU SAID THEY SHOULD GET NATIONAL 
MINIMUM WAGE 
WILL JUDE GET HER WAY 
ON PAY WILL BOB'S IDEALISM 
CRUMBLE MORE QUESTIONS THAN 
ANSWERS FOR MARGARET 
THEIR MISSION CONTINUES NEXT WEEK 
THEY TAKE ON POLITICIANS AND THEY 
FINALLY DELIVER THEIR CONCLUSIONS 
BECKY MILLIGAN REPORTING NEXT WEEK 
OUR THREE POLITICS SHOW VIEWERS 
WILL PRESENT THEIR CONCLUSIONS IN 
THE STUDIO TO THE LEADER OF THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS HARRIET HARMAN 
IT SHOULD BE A FASCINATING WATCH 
JOIN US FOR THAT LATER IN THE 
PROGRAMME WE MEET ROSIE LIKE MANY 
YOUNG PEOPLE SHE CAN'T AFFORD TO 
BUY A HOUSE SHE LIVES IN A VAN WE 
WILL HEAR FROM LOCATION LOCATION 
LOCATION'S KIRSTIE ALLSOPP BUT HOW 
SHE WANTS TO HELP FIRST TIME BUYERS 
WELCOME TO CITY HALL WEEK ONE OF 
BORIS JOHNSON'S MAYORTY AND THE 
BRISKEST OF STARTS ALCOHOL TO BE 
BANNED ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT THE 
APPOINTMENT OF A DEPUTY MAYOR A 
LONDON TSAR FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AS 
YET ANOTHER TEENAGE VICTIM OF 
VIOLENCE THE THIRTEENTH SO FAR THIS YEAR 
IS MOURNED IN LONDON AND THEN AN 
AGREEABLE CHIN WAG WITH NEW YORK'S 
MAYOR WHO WE WILL HEAR FROM A 
LITTLE LATER ON WE HAVE SEEN THE 
FIRST SHAPE OF A JOHNSON 
ADMINISTRATION HERE AT CITY HALL 
WITH MORE MUCH YET TO BE PUT IN 
PLACE 
BEFORE TAKING OFFICE THE LARGEST 
ORGANISATION THE BORIS JOHNSON HAD 
RUN WAS THE SPECTATOR MAGAZINE 
ANDREW WORKED WITH HIM THERE 
HE IS 
VERY VERY GOOD AT DELEGATING HE'S 
GOOD AT APPRECIATING THE PEOPLE WHO 
CAN DO THE DETAILED AND 
ADMINISTRATIVE WORK WHICH IS HE 
COMPLETELY HOPELESS AT 
BORIS JOHNSON HAS ALWAYS SAID HE 
WOULD RELY ON GOOD STAFF TO RUN 
THINGS WHEN HE BECAME MAYOR THAT 
HE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE 
BUT HE WOULD EMPLOY PEOPLE WHO DID 
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THOUGH HE 
WAS RELUCTANT TO SAY WHO THEY WERE 
THIS WEEK WE GOT A GLIMPSE OF MR. 
JOHNSON'S FIRST SHUFFLE OF THE DECK 
HIS CHIEF OF STAFF IS NICK BALLS 
CLOSE FRIEND OF DAVID CAMERON SAID 
BY MANY TO WE THE SECOND MOST 
POWERFUL MAN AT CITY HALL HE IS 
REPORTED AS DESCRIBING HIMSELF AS 
BEING LINKED TO MR. JOHNSON BY DAVID 
CAMERON CAMERON HE'S NOT DESCRIBED BY CITY HALL AS 
A MEMBER OF STAFF APPOINTED BY THE 
MAYOR THEY WERE ALSO UNABLE TO 
CONFIRM WHETHER HE IS PAID FROM THE 
PUBLIC PURSE OR BY THE CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY THERE'S ALSO BEEN A SUDDEN 
GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF DEPUTY 
MAYORS KEN LIVINGSTONE GOT BY WITH 
ONLY ONE NICKI GAVRON NOW WE 
HAVE FOUR 
I THINK WE HAVE GOT SOME FANTASTIC 
DEPUTY MAYORS THEY WILL BE LOOKING 
AT THE POLICE AT COMMUNITIES AND 
RAY LEWIS WHO IS THE MAN WHEN IT 
COMES TO INSPIRING YOUNG PEOPLE 
SHOWING THEM WHAT THEY CAN DO 
BRINGING HIS EXPERTISE TO EDUCATION 
AND I'VE GOT TO RUSH NOW BUT WHAT 
BORIS FORGOT TO MENTION WAS IAN 
CLEMENT SO WHERE EXACTLY DO THESE 
PEOPLE COME FROM 
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY WAS A LOT OF 
CAREFUL THOUGHT I THINK 
MASTERMINDED BY NICK BALLS ABOUT 
WHO TO PUT INTO THE KEY JOBS IF 
BORIS WON HE STOOD AGAINST BORIS 
JOHNSON TO BECOME THE TORY 
CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR BUT WITHDREW 
DUE TO ILLNESS AT ONE TIME HE WAS 
REFERRED TO AS THE FRONT ONE HE IS 
ALSO A FORMER WESTMINSTER CITY 
COUNCIL AS WAS THE NEW DEPUTY 
MAYOR FOR POLICING AND THE NEW 
SENIOR ADVISER SIMON MILTON 
MILTON AND OTHERS THEY FORMED A 
TIGHT CLIQUE AND IT'S CLEAR THAT 
THAT TIGHT CLIQUE CONTINUES AND 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY DON'T RECKON 
THEY WILL STOP THERE EITHER 
WHETHER THAT WILL HAPPEN WILL NOT 
IS SOMETHING THAT ONLY TIME WILL 
REVEAL AS IT WOULD SEEM IS THE 
FATE OF THE LONDON DEVELOPMENT 
AGENCY AGENCY THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY 
PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE LONDON 
DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND THAT'S WHY 
THIS MORNING I GOT A FORENSIC AUDIT 
PANEL TO BE SET UP TO BE LOOKING 
AT WHAT THE LTA HAS BEEN DOING 
WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN ANY 
WRONGDOING WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN 
ANY MONEY WASTED AND WHAT WE CAN 
DO TO MAKE SURE IT NEVER HAPPENS 
AGAIN 
THERE IS ALSO NO NEWS AS TO AGAIN WHO WILL REPLACE THE DEPARTED CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OF THE LTA OR WHO WILL 
BE THE NEW SHARE TEMPORARY 
REPLACEMENTS HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED 
BUT WITH FEES AND OTHER KEY 
APPOINTMENTS STILL TO BE MADE HAS 
BORIS JOHNSON GOT ONE MORE ACE UP 
HIS SLEEVE 
WITH ME AT CITY HALL NOW THE 
PERSON WHO IS HEADING UP THIS AUDIT 
PANEL WELCOME TO CITY HALL YOU 
WILL BE LOOKING AT SPENDING HERE AT 
THE GREATER LONDON AUTHORITY AS 
WELL AS IN OTHER AREAS HOW MUCH DO 
YOU KNOW ABOUT WHAT THE DEVELOPMENT 
AGENCY HAS BEEN DOING UP TO NOW I I THINK QUITE A LOT IS ALREADY CLEAR 
THERE ARE ACCOUNTS FOR US TO LOOK 
AT BUT ANY ORGANISATION THAT IS 
SPENDING ON THE SCALE OF THE GLA 
TWELVE BILLION OR SO THERE MUST BE 
SCOPE TO DO THINGS BETTER SO WHILE 
WE CAN AT THIS WITH NO 
PRECONCEPTIONS THERE IS A FEELING 
THAT AT SOME STAGE PERHAPS THERE 
WILL BE ROOM FOR EFFICIENCIES 
THERE HAS BEEN STORM ABOUT 
FUNDING IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE TO 
BACK UP STORIES ABOUT PROBLEMS 
OTHER THAN WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW WE WE HAVE A POLICE INVESTIGATION GOING 
ON INTO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF WHAT 
HAPPENED AT THE LTA WHETHER THAT 
IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG OR 
NOT WE DON'T KNOW BUT WE INTEND 
TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY LDA BUT 
WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT IT JUST HAS 
NOT BEEN OPEN ENOUGH THERE HAS NOT 
BEEN ENOUGH SCRUTINY IT MAY BE 
THAT A LOT OF THE GRANTS HAVE BEEN 
SUCCESSFUL BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT 
LONDONERS DO NOT KNOW THERE ARE 
AREAS TO EXAMINE HOW THINGS MIGHT 
BE IMPROVED PARTICULARLY FROM MY 
POINT OF VIEW OF OPENNESS AND 
TRANSPARENCY AND SCRUTINY 
AND YET 
YOU WILL KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN 
ALREADY TAXPAYERS' MONEY SPENT ON A 
REVIEW CARRIED OUT BY DELOITTE'S A 
BIG CITY FIRM THERE ARE CHANGES IN 
PROCEDURES ALREADY I WONDER 
WHETHER THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT 
YOU MIGHT JUST BE DUPLICATING 
THIS 
KNOW WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT THIS DUPLICATING BUT WE ARE GOING TO 
BUILD ON THAT WORK ON MY PANEL I 
HAVE GOT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
INVOLVED IN GIVING GRANTS WHO KNOW 
HOW LOCAL AUTHORITIES WORK AND 
WILL BE ABLE TO ADVISE ON HOW TO GO 
FORWARD THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE 
WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR IS 
NOT REALLY USEFUL BUT THERE IS 
MORE TO BE DONE 
YOU MENTIONED TWO 
CONSERVATIVE LEADERS AND THEY HAVE 
TO GIVE GRANTS DO THEY PROVIDE THE 
NECESSARY INDEPENDENCE HERE FOR A 
PANEL THAT IS MEANT TO BE LOOKING 
DISPASSIONATELY AT PUBLIC SPENDING 
YES ABSOLUTELY THIS IS AN 
INDEPENDENT PANEL AM CHAIRING IT 
I AM NOT A MEMBER OF ANY COUNCIL 
WE CAN CO OPT PEOPLE SHOULD WE NEED 
TO DOT IN THE CONSERVATIVE VOTER THOUGH 
ARE YOU CONSERVATIVE THOUGH LEANING 
A ABSOLUTELY I HAVE MADE LEANING NO BONES ABOUT THAT 
NOW IT'S BUT 
TWO CONSERVATIVE LEADERS OF 
COUNCILS AND A CONSERVATIVE LEADER 
IS IT FAIR TO CALL HIS INDEPENDENT 
BUT IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT WE ARE 
UNITED IN DOING IS LOOKING FOR 
VALUE FOR MONEY FOR LONDON'S 
COUNCIL TAX PAYERS 
THE THAT'S THE 
POINT SURELY IT 
DO S. 
MATTER WHERE 
PEOPLE'S ALLEGIANCES ARE BECAUSE 
YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE 
COMING FROM ARE THEY LOOKING FOR 
EXAMPLES OF SPENDING THAT THEY 
DON'T AGREE WITH BECAUSE IT IS 
LABOUR SPENDING OR ARE YOU 
GENUINELY GOING IN WITH AN OPEN 
MIND TO ACTUALLY FIND WHAT HAS NOT 
BEEN SPENT APPROPRIATELY 
WE ARE 
GENUINELY GOING IN WITH OPEN MINDS 
AS I SAID AT THE START IT IS 
CERTAINLY NOT A WITCH HUNT BUT WE 
ARE ALL LONDON COUNCIL TAX PAYERS 
WE WANT TO SEE THAT OUR MONEY IS 
BEING WELL SPENT 
BUT THAT IS 
SUBJECTIVE ALL OF THE PEOPLE ON 
THE PANEL ARE GOING TO BE COMING 
FROM A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW 
VALUE FOR MONEY IS SUBJECTIVE ONLY 
UP TO POINT THERE ARE EXERCISES 
ONE CAN DO WHICH SHOW WHERE AND 
WHEN EFFICIENCIES ARE BEING 
DELIVERED AND THAT IS NOT 
OBJECTIVE IT IS OBJECTIVE FOR FOR INSTANCE WHAT IF YOU COME BACK AND 
SAY SURPRISINGLY THE SYSTEMS ARE 
IN PLACE AND I THINK THEY ARE 
DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB I THINK 
BORIS WOULD BE SURPRISED IF WE CAME 
BACK AND SAID THAT 
I WOULD BE 
SURPRISED IF THERE WAS NOT ROOM FOR 
IMPROVEMENT HOWEVER IF WE FIND 
THAT ALL IS HUNKY DORY IT 
CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE A BAD THING 
FOR US TO SAY SO BUT WE WOULD BE 
ABLE TO REASSURE LONDONERS 
IS IT 
NOT LIKELY THAT YOU ARE JUST GOING 
TO COME BACK AND SAY WE DO NOT 
AGREE WITH THE PRIORITIES OF THE 
SPENDING BUT THAT WOULD NOT 
SURPRISE ANYBODY HAVING SPENT ALL 
THIS MONEY ON AN AUDIT PANEL TO 
TELL US THAT 
WE ARE NOT SPENDING 
ALL OF THIS MONEY ON AN AUDIT PANEL 
NOT AT ALL L. AM GIVING MY SERVICES 
FREE SO WHY MY COLLEAGUES ON THE 
PANEL WE WOULD NOT DREAM OF DOING 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT WE'RE 
HOPING TO BENEFIT AS COUNCIL TAX 
PAYERS SO WE ARE NOT SPENDING ALL 
THIS MONEY 
DO YOU GO IN WITH THE 
THOUGHT THAT IT IS THE JOB OF THE 
LONDON DEVELOPMENT AGENCY TO BACK 
LOSERS SOMETIMES BECAUSE HARD TO 
REACH GROUPS ARE THE ONES THAT NEED 
PUBLIC MONEY IF YOU APPLY THE SAME 
FORENSIC EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE FROM 
THE CITY YOU MIGHT BE RATHER 
UNFAIR ON THOSE THAT NEED START UP 
MONEY 
I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE MONEY THAT SOMETIMES MONEY IS NOT GOING 
TO PRODUCE THE RESULT THAT WE WOULD 
LIKE IT TOO BUT I WOULD LIKE THOSE 
TO BE THE EXCEPTIONS AND CERTAINLY 
IF I LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN 
THE LAST EIGHT YEARS IT SEEMS TO 
ME THAT THERE ON MANY POCKETS OF 
REAL POVERTY IN LONDON THAT KEN 
DIDN'T TOUCH AND IF WE CAN 
ORGANISE THINGS AT THE LONDON 
DEVELOPMENT AGENCY SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENTLY MAYBE WE COULD HAVE 
MORE OF AN IMPACT ON THOSE AREAS A A I AM TOLD AN INTERIM REPORT IN THIRTY 
DAYS THE FULL REPORT IN A COUPLE 
OF MONTHS AND NICE TO HAVE YOU 
BACK TO TALK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU HAVE 
MADE YOUR CONCLUSIONS 
A WOULD BE 
DELIGHTED 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DELIGHTED THERE HAS BEEN A LONG OFTEN 
FRIENDLY RIVALRY BETWEEN LONDON AND 
NEW YORK AND THAT CITY'S OWN MAYOR 
WASTED NO TIME IN COMING OVER HERE 
TO SIZE UP HIS NEW COUNTERPART 
AFTER HE HAD BEEN PRESENTED WITH A 
SHIRT FROM MR. JOHNSON WITH A TUBE 
MAP ON THE FRONT THERE BLOOMBERG 
OFFERED HIS ADVICE TO THE NEWCOMER 
HERE AT CITY HALL BEFORE WE CAUGHT 
UP WITH HIM MAYOR BLOOMBERG AND 
ASKED HIM WHETHER HE HAD BEEN 
SURPRISED BY BORIS JOHNSON'S 
VICTORY 
NO I THINK THE POLLS SAID VICTORY THAT HE HAD COME FROM BEHIND AND 
HAD A LEAD GOING INTO THE FINAL 
PERIOD AND CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IN 
THE UNITED STATES WAS THAT HE HAD A 
GOOD SHOUT 
YOU MET WITH MAYOR 
JOHNSON TODAY WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF 
HIM 
I MET HIM ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HIM MONTHS AGO IN BLACKPOOL AND HE IS 
A PERSONABLE NICE GUY HE HAS THE 
MOST DISCONCERTING THING AS I 
LOOKED AT HIS C. V. BEFORE I WENT IN 
TO SEE HIM AND IT TURNS OUT THAT 
HE WAS BORN AFTER I GRADUATED FROM 
COLLEGE THAT WAS REALLY ANNOYING 
UNTIL SOMEBODY POINTED OUT THAT 
DAVID CAMERON IS EVEN YOUNGER YOU YOU WORK YOU WORKED CLOSELY WITH KEN 
LIVINGSTONE HOW DO THE TWO 
COMPARE 
THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT COMPARE PERSONALITIES ONLY HISTORY WILL 
TELL WHETHER THEY GOVERNED 
DIFFERENTLY OR HAD DIFFERENT 
LEVELS OF EFFECTIVENESS KEN IS A 
DIFFERENT KIND OF PERSON MAYBE A 
LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS ALTHOUGH 
HE CERTAINLY WAS SOMEBODY WHO 
EXPRESSED HIS VIEWS ANNOYED SOME 
PEOPLE IN DOING SO BUT I THINK 
BORIS ER AT THE BEGINNING WILL 
DO THE SAME THING THAT MICHAEL 
BLOOMBERG DID AND PROBABLY KEN 
LIVINGSTONE DID WHEN THEY CAME INTO 
OFFICE YOU SAY THINGS THAT POP 
INTO YOUR HEAD AND THEN LATER ON 
YOU PRESS SECRETARY OR THE FRONT 
PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER EXPLAINS TO 
YOU WHY YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE PHRASED 
IT THAT WAY OVER THE YEARS YOU 
LEARN HOW TO PRESENT IT IN A MORE 
DIPLOMATIC MANNER KEN DID IT I 
DID IT AND BORIS WILL IN THE 
BEGINNING HE WILL MAKE SOME 
MISTAKES AND YOU WILL MAKE FUN OF 
HIM AND MY ADVICE TO HIM WOULD BE 
THE SAME ADVICE I GAVE MY OLDEST 
DAUGHTER ONE TIME WHO CAME TO ME 
AFTER A YEAR IN OFFICE AND SHE 
SAID DADDY THEY'RE MAKING FUN OF 
YOU I SAID I KNOW THAT IT 
HURTS BUT YOU CAN'T LET THE PRESS 
KNOW THAT BUT I AM LEARNING EVERY 
DAY ON SUNDAY I WON'T BE MAKING 
THOSE MISTAKES AND NOBODY IS GOING 
TO REMEMBER AND NOBODY CARES THE 
ONLY THING ANYBODY CARES ABOUT IS 
THEIR HOUSE THEIR JOB THE STREETS 
THE FINANCES THE THINGS THAT I AM 
PAID TO ASSIST THEM WITH THE 
GAFFES WHICH I USED TO MAKE 
FREQUENTLY I NOW MAKE ONLY 
OCCASIONALLY BUT THAT IS A 
SIDESHOW IT WILL BE THE SAME FOR 
BORIS I THINK EVERY ELECTED 
OFFICIAL HAS THE SAME EXPERIENCE 
IF THEY HAVE NOT BEEN IN PUBLIC 
OFFICE BEFORE 
YOU TRIED TO BRING 
IN A CONGESTION CHARGE IN NEW YORK 
IT DID NOT HAPPEN 
THAT'S CORRECT 
HOW DISAPPOINTED WERE YOU 
WELL I 
HAVE BEEN VERY LUCKY TO ER MAKE A 
LITTLE BIT OF MONEY SO I DON'T HAVE 
TO WORRY ABOUT MY JOB I TAKE THE 
SUBWAY EVERY DAY SO THE TRAFFIC 
DOES NOT REALLY HURT ME VERY MUCH A 
I SHOULDN'T BE DISAPPOINTED IT'S 
THE PUBLIC THAT SHOULD BE 
DISAPPOINTED IT'S OUR KIDS WHO 
SHOULD BE DISAPPOINTED OUR KIDS 
WILL LOOK BACK ON US AND SAY WE DID 
NOT HAVE THE COURAGE TO DO WHAT WAS 
WHITE WE ARE DAMAGING THE 
ENVIRONMENT WE ARE POLLUTING THE 
AIR WE BREATHE WE ARE STRANGLING 
OUR ECONOMY STOP WHEN YOU GET 
BORED WITH THIS THIS STUFF IS GOOD 
BORIS JOHNSON IS LOOKING TO REVIEW 
THE WESTERN EXTENSION AS IT IS 
CALLED OF THE CONGESTION CHARGE I I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS WHAT YOU 
NEED TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO DISSUADE 
PEOPLE FROM USING GASOLINE AND 
DISSUADE THEM FROM CHOKING OUR 
ROADS AND HAVE A REVENUE SOURCE TO 
INVEST IN MASS TRANSIT THAT'S WHAT 
CONGESTION PRICING DOES BOTH OF 
THOSE THINGS 
FINALLY WHAT ADVICE 
HAVE YOU GOT TO GIVE OR HAVE YOU 
GIVEN TO MAYOR JOHNSON ON CRIME 
WELL BORIS JOHNSON DOESN'T HAVE 
CONTROL OVER THE POLICE DEPARTMENT 
HERE IN THE WAY I HAVE CONTROL IN 
NEW YORK CITY THE COMMISSIONER 
SERVES AT MY PLEASURE I SET THEIR 
BUDGET I HAVE PHENOMENAL POLICE 
COMMISSIONER SO WHY DON'T GET 
INVOLVED AT THE TACTICAL LEVEL BUT 
CERTAINLY YOU SHOULD HOLD ME 
RESPONSIBLE SO I DON'T BORIS 
DOES NOT HAVE THAT LUXURY THINK 
HE HAS GOT TO MAKE A CASE AS TO WHY 
YOU SHOULD HAVE LOCAL CONTROL OVER 
THE POLICE FORCE I BELIEVE AND 
CONTROL BY SOMEBODY WHO WANTS US TO 
THE PUBLIC ON AN ELECTED BASIS SO 
I THINK HE SHOULD TRY TO DO THAT 
BUT THERE IS LOT OF THINGS YOU 
CAN DO IN ADDITION TO JUST HAVING 
CONTROL OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE PUBLIC 
INVOLVED THEY ARE PART OF THE 
SOLUTION YOU'VE GOT TO IMPROVE 
EDUCATION THAT SPOT OF THE 
SOLUTION TO CRIME YOU'VE GOT TO 
HAVE CLEAN STREETS PEOPLE BEHAVE 
DIFFERENTLY WHEN THEY HAVE REASON 
TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEIGHBOURHOOD 
BORIS HAS GOT TO BE SEEN OUT THERE 
WITH THE AVERAGE PERSON BE IN THE 
PARKS THAT SOME PEOPLE THINK ARE 
DANGEROUS HE CAN SHOW THAT THEY'RE 
NOT OR GET POLICE ATTENTION IF 
YOU GET MORE PEOPLE IN THE PARKS 
YOU WILL HAVE LESS CRIME CRIME 
GOES TO PLACES WHERE THERE ARE NOT 
PEOPLE THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS 
THAT BORIS JOHNSON CAN DO AND HE 
WILL FIND THINGS THAT HE AND HIS 
ADVISERS COME UP WITH THAT WE NEVER 
THOUGHT OF IT IN NEW YORK L. WOULD 
LOVE TO COPY ANY OF THAT HE IS 
WELCOME TO COPY OUR STUFF BUT I 
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AN 
INTERESTING TIME AND NOW IT IS 
BORIS JOHNSON'S TURN TO TAKE THAT 
TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND HOPEFULLY 
KEN LIVINGSTONE IS STILL LIVING 
HERE HE SHOULD HOPE THAT HIS 
SUCCESSOR TAKES THINGS TO A BETTER 
LEVEL FOR LIVINGSTONE'S FAMILY 
AND FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO MAKE THE 
CITY A BETTER PLACE MAYOR MAYOR BLOOMBERG THANK YOU VERY MUCH HE HE MY PLEASURE 
KIT BORIS JOHNSON'S KEY 
REPRESENTATIVE ON THE METROPOLITAN 
POLICE AUTHORITY JOINS ME NOW 
THERE BLOOMBERG SAYING THERE THAT 
THERE ARE BOUND TO BE GAFFS ARE 
YOU SAID FOR THOSE ARE YOU READY 
FOR THOSE 
WE EXPECT TO BE JUDGED 
JUST AS HARSHLY AS THE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATION WAS ABSOLUTELY WE 
THINK WE'RE MOVING AT SPEED WE 
HAVE A LOT TO DELIVER WE HAVE A 
LOT OF PROMISES THAT WE WANT TO SEE 
HAPPEN QUICKLY AND WE'RE HAPPY TO 
TAKE THE SCRUTINY THAT COMES WITH 
THAT 
DO YOU ACCEPT THIS IDEA SO THAT FAR THAT HE WILL BE THE KIND OF 
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD BRINGING IN 
HEAVYWEIGHTS LIKE YOU BENEATH HIM 
AND THAT IS HOW HE WILL RUN THINGS 
YES I THINK YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN 
THIS WEEK THAT BORIS'S RUNNING 
THINGS ON A MUCH MORE COLLEGIATE 
BASIS ONE OF THE BIG CRITICISMS OF 
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WAS 
THAT IT WAS A FIEFDOM WITH ONE DAY 
IN CHARGE WITH ONE GUY IN CHARGE 
BORIS JOHNSON WANTS TO SPREAD 
AUTHORITY ACROSS A NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
WE THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR LONDON WE 
THINK IT'S GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY YOU YOU WILL BE FILLING THE GAP UNTIL BORIS 
JOHNSON HIMSELF WANTS TO TAKE OVER 
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE AUTHORITY 
HOW DO YOU THINK THE MET IS DOING 
AT THE MOMENT 
I THINK THE MET HAS 
GOT SOME OF THE WAY TOWARDS WHERE 
IT NEEDS TO BE AS AN ORGANISATION 
BUT I STILL THINK THERE IS AN AWFUL 
LOT TO DO L. THINK THE MET NEEDS TO 
FOCUS MORE ON WHAT THE PRIORITIES 
OF LONDONERS ARE AND WE SAW THAT 
REFLECTED IN THE WAY PEOPLE VOTED 
IN THE LONDON ELECTION 
WHAT HAVE 
THEY BEEN FAILING TO DO IN THAT 
RESPECT THEN 
I THINK THEY ARE NOT 
RESPONDING TO PEOPLE'S WORRIES 
ABOUT TRANSPORT IN PARTICULAR THE 
BIG ISSUE IN THE ELECTION WAS 
PEOPLE'S FEAR OF CRIME AROUND 
TRAVELLING ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT YOU 
WILL BE SEEING IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
MEASURES WE ARE TAKING TO ADDRESS 
THAT BOTH IMMEDIATELY AND IN THE 
MEDIUM TERM A THING PEOPLE ARE 
ALSO WORRIED AND WE HAVE SEEN 
AGAIN OVERNIGHT ABOUT I THINK 
THE GROWTH IN STABBINGS AND 
KILLINGS AMONGST YOUNG PEOPLE THAT 
WILL BE ONE OF THE MAJOR FOCUS IS 
OF THE NEXT FEW YEARS UNDER A 
JOHNSON MAYORALTY THERE WILL BE 
PEOPLE COMING ON BOARD TO TRY AND 
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THE ONE THING 
THAT YOU WILL SEE THAT IS DIFFERENT 
HERE IS THAT WE WILL TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS WE ARE FED 
UP OF POLITICIANS BLAMING EVERYBODY 
ELSE YOU WILL NEVER HEAR ME BLAME 
CAN OR MARGARET THATCHER OR 
SHOULD YOU APPOINT THE NEXT 
COMMISSIONER 
WE WANT TO HAVE A BIG COMMISSIONER SAY IN WHO THE NEXT COMMISSIONER IS 
WE ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING THE 
POLICE COMMIT TO THE REFORM WE 
WANT THE COMMISSIONER TO FOCUS ON 
THE PRIORITIES OF LONDON IF THEY 
TWO THAT WE WILL ALL BE FRIENDS 
PERHAPS WHEN SIR IAN BLAIR GOES 
YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SAY IN WHO 
IS APPOINTED 
ABSOLUTELY MAYOR 
LIVINGSTONE WAS REALLY THAT 
INTERESTED IN THE POLICE LEN 
DUVALL CHAIRMAN OF THE POLICE 
AUTHORITY DID A FANTASTIC JOB L. 
TAKE MY HAT OFF TO HIM HE DID A 
GOOD JOB WITHOUT THE FULL AUTHORITY 
OF THE MAYOR TO DO THAT THERE HAVE 
BEEN ILLPROVEMENTS AT THE MET WE 
HOPE EVERYBODY WILL FOCUS ON THE 
SAME THING SYSTEM I'M NOT 
INTERESTED IN A AUTHORITY THAT IS 
POLITICAL OR FIGHTING 
KIT THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH 
ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN EXPECT TO 
HEAR ABOUT IN THIS WEEK'S DRAFT 
QUEEN'S SPEECH IS AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING HOUSE PRICES HAVE SHOT UP 
IN THE PAST TEN YEARS AND CREDIT 
CUNCH MEANS FIRST TIME BUYERS ARE 
FINDING IT HARD TORE AFFORD A HOME 
OF THEIR OWN 
A MAN THEY'VE ASKED TO CARRY OUT 
THE WORK IS MATTHEW TAYLOR A 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT M. P. GILLIAN 
HARGREAVES HAS TO BEEN TO CORNWALL 
TO INVESTIGATE 
IT'S STUNNING ISN'T IT THE NORTH 
CORNWALL COAST HAS WHAT YOU MIGHT 
CALL PULLING POWER SUCH BEAUTY 
COMES WITH A PRICE TAG THAT NOT 
EVERYONE CAN AFFORD HOME SWEET 
HOME FOR ONE LOCAL IS LIGHTLY 
UNUSUAL IT'S A CONVERTED VAN 
SHE'S PAYING THE PRICE FOR THIS 
AREA'S POPULARITY 
HI ROSIE HI COME IN THANK YOU 
FOR INVITING ME TO YOUR HOUSE HOME 
THIS IS WHERE YOU SLEEP 
IT'S A 
KING SIZE BED THIS IS WHERE I 
SLEEP 
YOU HAVE INSULATION AS WELL SLEEP S. IT WARM 
IT IS WARM IT HOLDS THE 
HEAT QUITE WELL THE SINK AND 
COOKER WITH MY PUMP ACTION TAP IT IT WORKS YOU HAVE WATER AND STORAGE 
FOR MY FOOD AND MY FRIDGE YES YES I'VE GOT A FRIDGE 
IT'S GOT 
EVERYTHING YOU NEED MORE OR LESS 
IT CAN'T BE IDEAL BUT YOU CAN LIVE 
HERE YES 
ROSIE KLOSKA WORKS AT HERE YES THE LOCAL PUB BUT ON HER WAGES 
SHE CAN ONLY LIVE IN A VAN 
THERE IS A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF 
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN PLACES THAT ARE 
NOT QUITE HOUSES IF THEY COULD 
CREATE ACCOMMODATION THAT WE COULD 
AFFORD TO RENT A GENUINELY 
AFFORDABLE PRICE FOR WHAT THE 
GENUINE LOCAL WAGE IS THAT WOULD 
MEAN THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 
MY AGE N. THIS POSITION WOULD HAVE 
SOMEWHERE THEY COULD CALL HOME WHY WHY CAN'T YOU GO AND LIVE IN AN INNER 
CITY OR A SUBURB SOMEWHERE AWAY 
FROM HERE THAT IS CHEAPER WELL WELL LOTS OF REASONS MAINLY I WORK 
HERE I HAVE WORKED HERE FOR A FEW 
YEARS NOW I'M PART OF THE FABRIC 
OF SOCIETY THAT GOES ON HERE 
PEOPLE NEED TO WORK IN PUBS AND IN 
SHOPS WHY SHOULDN'T WE STAY IN OUR 
COMMUNITIES OTHERWISE THEY WILL 
DIE OUT 
THE COMPETITION FOR 
ACCOMMODATION IN THIS VILLAGE IS SO 
INTENSE THE FORMER PUBLIC TOILETS 
HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO A HOLIDAY 
HOME ACCORDING TO LOCALS IT'S 
BEEN SOLD FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND THE THE CHEAPEST IS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
GRAHAM JOHNS 
HAS BEEN AN ESTATE AGENT IN THE 
VILLAGE OF STING ANESS FOR FORTY YEARS 
WHAT WOULD I PAY FOR A TWO 
BEDROOMED PROPERTY AROUND HERE WITH 
A SEA VIEW 
IT WILL BE THE BEST 
PART OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND AT LEAST 
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
YES IT'S GOT LOVELY SEA FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND VIEWS YOU WILL PLAY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WHO WHO ON EARTH CAN AFFORD THAT THE THE RETIRED OR THE WEALTHY HOLIDAY HOME 
BRIGADE 
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN BRIGADE YOUNGSTERS EARN FIFTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR 
THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT EARNING THAT 
YOU STAND THERE VERY POLITELY AND 
YOU SAID I'M SO SORRY I CAN'T 
HELP 
HELP COULD BE AT HAND THE HELP LOCAL LIBERAL DEMOCRAT M. P. HAS BEEN 
ASKED BY THE LABOUR PRIME MINISTER 
TO FIND WAYS TO CREATE CHEAP 
HOUSING HI 
HI ROSIE I'VE BEEN HOUSING HI WANTING TO MEET YOU 
THIS IS MY 
HOME 
THAT SAYS EVERYTHING 
IT DOES HOME IN THEORY THERE ARE POLICIES IN 
PLACE TO HELP WITH AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING BUT THIS IS A CLASSIC 
EXAMPLE THAT IT'S NOT WORKING 
THERE'S BEEN MORE HOMES SOLD OFF 
OLD COUNCIL HOUSE THEY'VE ALL BEEN 
DISAPPEARING FROM VILLAGES LIKE 
THIS WHAT WERE PERHAPS RELATIVELY 
AFFORDABLE RENTED COTTAGES ARE NOW 
HOLIDAY LETS WHERE PEOPLE CAN EARN 
MORE MONEY FROM THEM RENTING A FEW 
MONTHS OF THE YEAR RATHER THAN 
RENTING TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHAT 
I'M REALLY ABOUT IS SETTING OUT 
SOME CHANGES THAT I THINK CAN BE 
MADE TO DELIVER THE HOMES THAT 
PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE NEEDING IF WE 
DON'T NEED IT VILLAGES LIKE THIS 
WILL BECOME PLACES THAT NO ONE CAN 
AFFORD TO LIVE 
THERE ARE HOUSES 
BEING BUILT IN STING ANESS BUT NOT 
NEARLY ENOUGH CHEAP ONES ONLY FOUR 
ON THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE RENTAL 
OR PART BUY MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE 
ARE ON THE COUNCIL HOUSING LIST 
IN ANY CASE IS BUILDING MORE 
HOUSES THE ANSWER ESPECIALLY IF 
THE HOLIDAY HOMES' BRIGADE KEEPS 
SNAPPING THEM UP 
IN THIS ROW OF COTTAGES ONLY ONE 
IS STILL PERMANENTLY OCCUPIED THE 
REST ARE EITHER HOLIDAY LETS OR 
SECOND HOMES SOME PEOPLE WANT THAT 
TO BE CURBED 
CORNWALL IS THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE 
WHERE YOU CANNOT BUILD YOUR WAY OUT 
OF THE HOUSING PROBLEM REGULARLY 
ASK ESTATE AGENT IN MY CONSTITUENCY 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE MARKET 
EVEN THE MOST RECENT SURVEY 
DEMONSTRATES THAT FOUR TIMES IN 
FACT MORE THAN FOUR TIMES OF HOMES 
ARE SOLD TO SECOND HOMEOWNERS THAN 
TO FIRST TIME BUYERS 
WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT LAW 
WE WANT A PLANNING APPLICATION 
PROCESS TO GO THROUGH THAT WOULD 
GIVE THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE 
POWER TO PUT CAP ON THE NUMBER OF 
PROPERTIES OWNED BY SECOND 
HOMEOWNERS 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT M. P. HOMEOWNERS MATTHEW TAYLOR SAYS THAT IS 
INPRACTICAL 
HOW CAN YOU LOOK AT INPRACTICAL ELECTRICITY BILLS AND WATER BILLS 
AND WHEN THEY USE THE LOCAL PETROL 
STATION ENFORCABILITY IS THE ISSUE 
HERE I'M PERSONALLY CONVINCED IF 
CAN DO IT SOMETHING CAN BE DONE I I HAVE SEEN ONE PROPERTY AND THEY 
STILL HAVE THE CHRISTMAS TREE IN 
THE FRONT GARDEN THEY OBVIOUSLY 
HAVEN'T BEEN HERE FOR MONTH 
AT THE 
MOMENT THERE'S NO REASON FOR THOSE 
PEOPLE TO DO ANYTHING ELSE IF YOU 
HAVE RULES THAT SAY NO PEOPLE 
OFTEN FIND WAYS AROUND IT MATTHEW MATTHEW TAYLOR HAS SOME DIFFICULT CHOICES 
PEOPLE ARE PRESSING HIM FOR RADICAL 
SOLUTIONS HIS REPORT WILL BE OUT 
IN JULY HIGH SEASON IN STING ANESS 
WILL ROSIE KLOSKA HAVE ANYTHING TO 
CELEBRATE CELEBRATE IT'S NOT JUST LABOUR AND THE LIB 
DEMS THE TORIES TOO ARE KEEN TO 
TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO 
MUCH SO THEY'VE RECRUITED KIRSTIE 
ALLSOPP BEST KNOWN FOR HER WORK ON 
LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION TO BE 
PART OF THEIR SKPHIGS ON HOME 
BUYING I MET KIRSTIE AT LONDON'S 
KENSINGTON PLACE RESTAURANT L. 
ASKED HER WHAT SHE WOULD DO 
ANYBODY WHO IS SELLING HOUSE AT 
THE MOMENT IS FINDING IT 
INCREASINGLY STRESSFUL AND ANYONE 
WHO IS BUYING HOUSE NIGHON 
IMPOSSIBLE PARTLY BECAUSE OF STAMP 
DUTY PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH AND PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE 
PROCESS BEING SO DIFFICULT IN MANY 
CASES THAT CAN BE THE FINAL STRAW 
AS FAR AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOES 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO 
LOOK AT VERY CLOSELY IS COMMUNITY 
LED PROJECTS IN RURAL AREAS ARE 
YOU AN ARCHERS' LISTENER I'M 
LOOKING FOR ROB AND HAYLEY'S HOUSE 
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE HOUSE 
FOR ROY AND HAYLEY 
WOULD ROY AND 
HAYLEY FIND IT EASIER WHEN HOUSE 
PRICES HAVE DROPPED AREN'T FALLING 
HOUSE PRICES A GOOD THING FOR FOR FIRST TIME BUYERS YES THERE IS NO 
DOUBT THAT FALLING HOUSE PRICES ARE 
A GOOD THING WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE IS PRICES GOING UP AT MUCH 
SLOWER RATE AND A MUCH MORE 
MANAGEABLE RATE ONE OF THE REASONS 
IT LOOKS LIKE PRICES ARE COMING 
DOWN AT THE MOMENT IS BECAUSE THERE 
ARE SO FEW THINGS ON THE MARKET 
THAT THE ONLY THINGS THAT ARE BEING 
SOLD ARE BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
DISCOUNT IN DESPERATION 
YOU ARE 
SAYING NO STAMP DUTY FOR ANY 
PROPERTY UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
FOR FIRST 
TIME BUYERS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
THERE IS NO WAY 
I WAS WORKING WITH A YOUNG COUPLE A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO HE WAS A 
SOLDIER SHE WAS A NANNY THEY 
WEREN'T GOING TO GO ON HONEYMOON 
BECAUSE THE TWO THOUSAND THEY NEEDED IN 
STAMP DUTY TO BOY THEIR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
HOUSE WHICH THEY SPENT SIX YEARS 
SAVING UP FOR THAT IS THEIR 
HONEYMOON MONEY IT'S UNJUSTIFIABLE 
HOW DOES HAVING NO STAMP DUTY HELP 
IF YOU HAVE IN THE PRESENT CLIMATE 
GOT TO FIND TWENTY FIVE PER CENT DEPOSIT BEFORE THE 
MORTGAGE LENDER WILL GIVE YOU THE 
MONEY 
EXACTLY THAT IS MY POINT MONEY THE STAMP DUTY IS TAKING AWAY FROM 
THE DEPOSIT L. DON'T THINK IT'S ANY 
COINCIDENCE THAT THE DAYS OF NINETY FIVE PER CENT 
AND ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT MORTGAGES HAVE 
ARISEN DURING THE SAME PERIOD WHEN 
WE'VE SEEN THESE EXTRAORDINARY 
RISES IN STAMP DUTY THE GOVERNMENT 
HAVE BEEN STEALING PEOPLE'S 
DEPOSITS 
BUT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD DEPOSITS SAY LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE DOING WE 
ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP A HOUSE 
BUILDING 
PROGRAMME AND ARE DOING AN 
ENORMOUS AMOUNT TO HELP FIRST TIME 
BUYERS 
THEY'RE NOT L. WISH THEY BUYERS ARE THE PROBLEM IS TARGETS DON'T 
WORK UNLESS GORDON BROWN AND HIS 
COLLEAGUES ARE PREPARED TO ACTUALLY 
PUT THE HARD HATS ON THEMSELVES AND 
BUILD THOSE HOUSES WE'VE GOT TO 
GET THE DEVELOPERS ON BOARD 
PRIVATE COMPANIES HAVE TO BE 
INVOLVED WITH THIS PROCESS IF YOU 
DO WHAT KEN LIVINGSTONE DID IN 
LONDON AND YOU SAY THAT EVERY NEW 
PROJECT MUST BE FIFTY PER CENT AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING AND FIFTY PER CENT TO MARKET THE 
DEVELOPERS SAY FORGET IT WE CAN'T 
AFFORD TO DO THAT WE'RE NOT GOING 
TO DO IT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS 
MAKE IT REALISTIC PARTICULARLY IN 
RURAL AREAS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO 
TO ANY VILLAGE NOW YOU WILL SEE A 
ROW A TERRACED ROW OF EIGHT TO TEN 
HOUSES BUILT POST WAR THERE IS 
ONE OF THEM ON THE EDGE OF EVERY 
SINGLE VILLAGE IN THE COUNTRY 
INTERESTINGLY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT 
WHAT ABOUT MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT 
FOR WEALTHY PEOPLE TO BUY SECOND 
HOMES WHICH I KNOW SOME 
POLITICIANS ARE FLIRTING ABOUT THAT 
IDEA 
I KNOW IT WOULD BE VERY IDEA IDEALISTIC TO SAY YOU CAN'T BUY A 
SECOND HOME BUT I DON'T THINK IT 
WOULD HELP IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE 
THING TO POLICE FOR EXAMPLE I 
HAVE A SECOND HOME I'M IN A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE THAT I'M 
NOT MARRIED TOO WHO'S TO SAY ONE 
HOUSE IS NOT HIS AND THE OTHERS IS 
NOT MINE IT WOULD BE A VERY 
DIFFICULT THING TO DO IN A FREE 
MARKET PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO BUY 
AS MANY HOMES AS THEY WANT WHAT WE 
HAVE DO IS MAKE SURE THAT FOR THE 
PEOPLE WITHIN THOSE LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES THOSE PROPERTIES ARE 
AVAILABLE IN DEVON AND CORNWALL 
THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST RATIO OF 
SALARY TO HOUSE PRICES THERE ARE 
SOME AREAS IN CORNWALL WHERE 
MORTGAGES ARE TWENTY TIMES THE AMOUNT 
AS SALARIES 
WILL WE SEE YOU BECOMING A LORD OR 
A BARONESS 
I'M A ONE TRICK PONY 
I'M INTERESTED IN PROPERTY AND 
PEOPLE I HAVE WORKED WITH PEOPLE 
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE DIVIDE 
POLITICIANS ARE ACADEMIC AND 
INTELLIGENT I WANT TO SEE THAT 
KIND OF PERSON BE A MINISTER NOT 
SOMEONE LIKE ME 
KIRSTIE ALLSOPP 
THANK YOU 
WE HAVE MORE ON THOSE STORIES ON 
OUR WEBSITE 
ARE ELDERLY PEOPLE DISCRIMINATED 
AGAINST WE WILL DISCUSS THAT NEXT 
WEEK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING 
WITH US SEE YOU NEXT SUNDAY 
GOODBYE 
JUST TALK TO US 
IF I TELL THE WORLD 
I'LL NEVER SAY ENOUGH 
COS IT WAS NOT SAID TO YOU 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED TO DO 
IF I END UP WITH YOU 
TALK 
HOLBY BLUE BEING A GOOD COP IS JUST THE HALF OF IT
