WELCOME TO THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 
THE WILDEBEEST MIGRATION 
ONE OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR SIGHTS ON THE AFRICAN PLAINS 
IT LOOKS LIKE CHAOS 
BUT THE MIGRATION IS SHAPED BY SOME EXTRAORDINARY BEHAVIOUR 
WE'LL SHOW YOU WILDEBEEST AS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE 
THEY'RE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL LARGE ANIMAL ON THE SERENGETI 
THEIR NUMBERS ARE PHENOMENAL BUT HOW DO THEY ACHIEVE THEM 
WILDEBEEST SPEND THEIR LIVES ON THE MOVE 
THEY'RE ON A PERMANENT QUEST FOR THIS 
RAIN 
AND THE FRESH GREEN GRASS THAT IT BRINGS 
BUT THE AFRICAN PLAINS ARE ALWAYS CHANGING 
AND THE RAINS ARE UNPREDICTABLE 
JUST HOW THE WILDEBEEST TRACK THE WEATHER IS STILL A MYSTERY 
BY FOLLOWING THE RAINS THEY CAN FIND ENOUGH FOOD TO SURVIVE 
AND THIS STRATEGY IS SO SUCCESSFUL 
THAT THEIR NUMBERS EXCEED THOSE OF ANY OTHER ANTELOPE 
HERD UPON HERD 
THEY FORM A SUPER HERD OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION INDIVIDUALS 
EACH ANIMAL IN THE SUPER HERD 
IS FOLLOWING ITS OWN INSTINCTS TO SURVIVE 
AND TRAVELLING IN HUGE NUMBERS IS ITSELF VERY ADVANTAGEOUS 
BUT THERE'S NO ORGANISATION OR HIERARCHY THERE ARE NO LEADERS 
ANY ANIMAL COULD START MOVING AND THOUSANDS MIGHT FOLLOW 
SINCE THEY MUST COVER ENORMOUS DISTANCES 
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR WILDEBEEST TO TRAVEL AS ECONOMICALLY AS POSSIBLE 
THEIR HIGH FOREQUARTERS AND LOW HINDQUARTERS 
GIVE THEM A ROCKING GAIT 
THAT'S A VERY EFFICIENT WAY OF COVERING LONG DISTANCES 
THEY TRAVEL FROM PASTURE TO PASTURE IN A SUPER HERD 
THAT SNAKES ITS WAY ACROSS THE SAVANNAH 
IN CHARACTERISTIC LONG LINES 
WILDEBEEST ALSO PREFER TO TRAVEL BUMPER TO BUMPER 
OPEN GRASSLANDS ARE FULL OF PREDATORS AND 
AS IN CROSSING A MINEFIELD THIS IS THE SAFEST WAY TO TRAVEL 
LIVING IN A SUPER HERD 
CAN PROTECT THE WILDEBEEST AGAINST LIONS IN OTHER WAYS TOO 
LIONS LIVE IN SMALL FAMILY GROUPS 
THEIR CUBS CAN'T TRAVEL VERY FAR SO THE ADULTS CAN'T EITHER 
THAT MEANS THEY CAN'T FOLLOW THE SUPER HERD AS IT MIGRATES 
INSTEAD THEY MUST REMAIN IN THEIR TERRITORIES 
AND WAIT FOR A MASSIVE CONVEYOR BELT OF MEALS TO COME WITHIN RANGE 
WILDEBEEST TRAVELLING THROUGH THESE AREAS NEED TO BE PREPARED 
AND THEY USE DIFFERENT TACTICS IN DIFFERENT PLACES 
THEY MUST BE PARTICULARLY CAREFUL WHEN FEEDING IN LONG GRASS 
THE WILDEBEEST ABANDON THEIR LONG MARCHING LINES AND BUNCH TOGETHER 
EACH ANIMAL TRYING TO GET AS MUCH FOOD AS POSSIBLE 
BUT NO ONE WANTING TO PUSH TO THE FRONT 
IT'S A SELFISH STRATEGY AND IT WORKS 
HUDDLING TOGETHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HERD 
MEANS YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO GET CAUGHT 
AND BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO STEP OUT INTO THE OPEN 
ANIMALS LINE UP WITH ALMOST MILITARY PRECISION 
INTO THESE EXTRAORDINARY FEEDING FRONTS 
BUT THERE ARE ALSO DISADVANTAGES TO FEEDING IN A SUPER HERD 
WILDEBEEST FEEL SAFER WHEN THEY'RE CROWDED TOGETHER MORE RELAXED 
THEY'RE LESS WARY 
AND THIS MAKES IT EASIER FOR LIONS TO CREEP UP ON BIG HERDS 
THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR LIONS 
THEY MUST GET CLOSE 
THE LIONESS HAS HAD TO WORK HARD FOR THIS VICTORY 
THE MAJORITY OF ANY LION'S HUNTS ARE FAILURES 
ON A LARGE SCALE THE SELFISH STRATEGY OF BUNCHING TOGETHER 
SERVES WILDEBEEST VERY WELL 
SO WELL IN FACT THAT THE SUPER HERD'S NUMBERS 
ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY LIONS OR ANY OTHER PREDATOR 
THE BIGGEST KILLER OF WILDEBEEST IS SOMETHING ELSE 
SOMETHING THAT THRIVES ON CLOSELY PACKED ANIMALS 
DISEASE 
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO RINDERPEST ARRIVED IN AFRICA 
IT CAME FROM IMPORTED CATTLE 
AND SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE THROUGH THE SUPER HERD 
IN TWO YEARS NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF THEM WERE DEAD 
IT TOOK SIXTY YEARS FOR THE DISEASE TO SUBSIDE BUT THEN IN JUST TEN YEARS 
THE SUPER HERD'S NUMBER ROSE AGAIN TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION 
BUT LIVING IN SUCH DENSITIES 
AND KEEPING PERPETUALLY ON THE MOVE DOES BRING PROBLEMS 
COURTSHIP BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT 
IN FACT EVEN WITH THOUSANDS OF FEMALES TO CHOOSE FROM 
A MALE MUST BE VERY DETERMINED TO WIN A MATE 
BY THE END OF THE RAINY SEASON 
THE WILDEBEEST ARE WELL FED AND IN PEAK CONDITION 
IT'S THE BEST TIME FOR FEMALES TO BREED 
AND OVER THE SPACE OF THREE WEEKS THEY ALL BECOME SEXUALLY RECEPTIVE 
BUT THE MIGRATION IS STILL ON THE MOVE 
IF YOU LIVE IN THE FAST LANE YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO SPEED DATE 
ALTHOUGH THE SUPER HERD MUST BE THE LARGEST SINGLES' PARTY ON EARTH 
WITH THOUSANDS OF FEMALES TO CHOOSE FROM 
THERE ARE ALSO THOUSANDS OF OTHER MALES TO COMPETE WITH 
TO IMPROVE THEIR CHANCES MALES SET UP SMALL TERRITORIES 
THEN THEY BELLOW GRUNT 
AND PRANCE ABOUT IN THEIR DISTINCTIVE ROCKING CANTER 
FRANTIC TO CATCH A FEMALE'S EYE 
THE PROBLEM IS EACH FEMALE COMES INTO SEASON FOR ONLY ONE DAY 
AND THE MALES ARE DESPERATE TO MATE WITH AS MANY AS POSSIBLE 
EVENTUALLY THE SUPER HERD BREAKS UP INTO A PATCHWORK OF SMALL GROUPS 
EACH DEFENDED BY A BULL 
SOME BULLS WILL EVEN ALLOW ADOLESCENT MALES IN THEIR GROUP 
THEY ACT LIKE DECOY DUCKS TO ATTRACT FEMALES 
A MALE HAS TO WORK HARD TO KEEP THESE FEMALES TO HIMSELF 
FOR WHILE HIS BACK IS TURNED OTHER MALES WILL MOVE INTO HIS HAREM 
AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS THERE WILL BE A FIGHT 
BRUTE FORCE IS ONE WAY FOR A MALE TO KEEP FEMALES 
BUT A FEW HAVE DISCOVERED A MORE RELAXING WAY TO DO IT 
ON HOT DAYS EVERYONE WANTS SHADE 
BULLS WITH A TREE IN THEIR TERRITORY BECOME VERY POPULAR 
WILDEBEEST CLEVER ENOUGH TO FIND A TREE ARE NEVER SHORT OF ADMIRERS 
WHATEVER THEIR STRATEGY 
THE BULLS HAVE TO MOVE FAST IF THEY ARE TO PASS ON THEIR GENES 
THE SUPER HERD WILL SOON BE ON THE MOVE AGAIN 
THE VAST RICH GRASSLANDS OF THE SERENGETI 
ARE BUSTLING WITH ALL SORTS OF LIFE 
AS THE MIGRATION CONTINUES 
THE SUPER HERD MOWS ITS WAY ACROSS ANOTHER NEW PASTURE 
WITH THEIR BROAD MUZZLES FLEXIBLE LIPS AND WIDE ROW OF INCISOR TEETH 
WILDEBEEST MAKE FORMIDABLE LAWN MOWERS 
THEY'RE SUCH EFFICIENT CUTTERS OF GRASS 
THAT THE SUPER HERD CAN QUICKLY TURN KNEE HIGH PASTURE 
INTO A TRIMMED LAWN 
BUT THIS CREW CUT DOESN'T SUIT EVERYONE 
TOPI HAVE MOUTHS THAT ARE ADAPTED TO FEEDING ON LONGER GRASSES 
THEY FIND IT HARD TO NIBBLE THE SHORT TURF 
LEFT BEHIND BY THE WILDEBEEST 
IN FACT IF THE SUPER HERD TRIMS THE GRASS TO JUST TWO C. M. HIGH 
IT HALVES THE AMOUNT OF FOOD A TOPI CAN REACH 
BY CROPPING THE PASTURE IN THE WAY THEY DO 
WILDEBEEST AFFECT THE FORTUNES OF MANY OTHER GRAZERS 
SOME GRAZERS ARE HELPED BY THIS EXTREME FORM OF LANDSCAPING 
THOMSON'S GAZELLES ARE AMONG THEM 
THEY PREFER SHORT GRASS AND BY TAGGING ALONG BEHIND THE SUPER HERD 
THEY CAN FIND PLENTY OF IT 
THEY ARE MORE DELICATE EATERS 
WITH SMALL MOUTHS THAT CAN PICK OUT TENDER SHOOTS 
MISSED BY THE WILDEBEEST 
AND THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES 
TO BENEFIT FROM THE WILDEBEEST'S WAY OF GRAZING 
EACH WILDEBEEST EATS FOUR KILOGRAMS OF GRASS A DAY 
THAT MEANS THE SUPER HERD LEAVES BEHIND IT 
FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY TONS OF DUNG EVERY DAY 
IT'S AN IMMENSE WINDFALL FOR DUNG BEETLES 
AND THEY HOME IN ON IT FROM ALL OVER THE SAVANNAH 
WITHIN HOURS THEY'VE ROLLED THE DUNG INTO BALLS AND BURIED IT 
EACH BALL PROVIDES THEIR YOUNG WITH FOOD AND SHELTER 
BUT IT ALSO FERTILISES THE PASTURE FOR NEXT YEAR'S GRASS 
IN FACT THE SERENGETI LANDSCAPE IS IN A CONSTANT CYCLE OF CHANGE 
IT'S SHAPED AND RE SHAPED BY ALL SORTS OF FORCES 
FROM SEASON TO SEASON 
YEAR TO YEAR 
SOME OF THESE CHANGES ARE NATURAL OTHERS ARE NOT 
FIRES LOOK DEVASTATING 
BUT MANY ARE DELIBERATELY STARTED BY THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON THE SAVANNAHS 
TO ENCOURAGE NEW GRASS FOR THEIR CATTLE 
BUT THESE FIRES ALSO DAMAGE TREES 
THERE ARE OTHER DANGERS TOO 
THAT THREATEN A TREE GROWING ON THE SAVANNAH 
ELEPHANTS ARE ALSO LANDSCAPERS 
THEIR TECHNIQUE IS VERY DIFFERENT 
HUNGRY ELEPHANTS TRYING TO REACH THE BEST LEAVES ON THE TOPMOST BRANCHES 
CAN EASILY DESTROY MATURE TREES AND EVENTUALLY WHOLE WOODLANDS 
THE DAMAGE THEY DO HAS HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE SAVANNAH 
WILDEBEEST TOO WILL DAMAGE TREES 
THE BULLS LIKE TO BATTER YOUNG TREES WITH THEIR HORNS 
USING THEM LIKE PUNCH BAGS TO VENT THEIR AGGRESSION 
SO AS THE SUPER HERD BULLDOZES ITS WAY ACROSS THE SAVANNAH 
WOODLANDS ARE OFTEN BADLY DAMAGED 
IN FACT THIRTY YEARS AGO 
WHEN THE SUPER HERD HAD RECOVERED FROM RINDERPEST 
THE SERENGETI WOODLANDS WERE TRANSFORMED 
THE TREES THAT ARE MOST DAMAGED 
ARE THOSE AROUND THE FRINGES OF WOODLAND PATCHES 
AND WHEN THEY FALL THEY ARE REPLACED BY GRASS 
SO THE PASTURE EXPANDS STILL FURTHER 
EVERY YEAR THE SUPER HERD MOVES ACROSS THE SERENGETI 
BUT IT NEVER FOLLOWS EXACTLY THE SAME ROUTE 
THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR PLACE THOUGH TO WHICH THEY ALWAYS RETURN 
AT ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME EACH YEAR 
THE WILDEBEEST GATHER ON A PARTICULAR PASTURE 
IN THE SOUTH EASTERN SERENGETI 
ITS VOLCANIC SOIL GIVES THIS GRASS 
VERY HIGH LEVELS OF PROTEIN CALCIUM AND PHOSPHORUS 
IT'S JUST WHAT THE FEMALES NEED 
TO PRODUCE RICH MILK TO FEED THEIR CALVES 
SINCE RUTTING IN THE SUPER HERD WAS COMPLETED WITHIN THREE WEEKS 
CALVING TOO HAPPENS ALL TOGETHER IN A SIMILAR SHORT PERIOD 
BUT GIVING BIRTH ON THESE OPEN GRASSLANDS 
MEANS THAT THE MOTHERS AND CALVES ARE VERY EXPOSED 
MOTHERS IN LABOUR ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE 
THERE ARE PREDATORS EVERYWHERE 
BUT CALVING AT THE SAME TIME IS IN ITSELF A PROTECTION 
UP TO TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND CALVES ARE BORN A DAY 
AND ANY ONE CALF ARRIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS 
IS THEREFORE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO BE SINGLED OUT 
IF A PREDATOR DOES MOVE IN 
FEMALES HAVE A NUMBER OF WAYS OF GETTING OUT OF DANGER 
MOTHERS IN LABOUR CAN STOP THEIR CONTRACTIONS IN AN INSTANT 
AND MOVE OFF WITH THE HERD 
FEMALES ALSO TEND TO WAIT UNTIL MORNING TO GIVE BIRTH 
BEING BORN AT THAT TIME 
GIVES CALVES THE CHANCE TO GAIN STRENGTH BEFORE NIGHTFALL 
WHEN PREDATORS ARE MORE ACTIVE AND HARDER TO SPOT 
BUT IT'S STILL A RACE AGAINST TIME 
JACKALS ARE NO THREAT TO ADULT WILDEBEEST 
BUT THEY CAN KILL CALVES 
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR 
NEWBORN CALVES MUST STAND UP AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
EVEN IF A CALF IS SLOW TO FIND ITS FEET 
ITS MOTHER WILL PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT IF THE JACKAL MOVES IN 
WILDEBEEST CALVES INSTINCTIVELY STAND UP AS SOON AS THEY CAN 
SOME CAN BE ON THEIR FEET JUST THREE MINUTES AFTER BIRTH 
ONCE IT'S UP THE JACKAL HAS LOST ITS CHANCE 
AND THE CALF IS REWARDED WITH MILK 
JACKALS SCAVENGE WHERE THEY CAN 
IF THEY CAN'T STEAL A CALF AN AFTERBIRTH WILL DO INSTEAD 
THESE CALVES NEED TO DO EVERYTHING QUICKLY 
THEY MUST BOND WITH THEIR MOTHERS BEFORE THE HERD MOVES ON 
IN A SUPER HERD OF OVER ONE MILLION 
KNOWING WHO TO FOLLOW IS ESSENTIAL FOR SURVIVAL 
NO OTHER ANTELOPE BREEDS IN THIS SYNCHRONISED WAY 
IT'S A SUPER HERD STRATEGY THAT GIVES ITS MEMBERS A HUGE ADVANTAGE 
BUT THERE ARE OTHER TIMES 
WHEN THE WILDEBEEST INSTINCT TO KEEP IN STEP IS DANGEROUS 
BEING PART OF A SUPER HERD CAN ALSO BE DISASTROUS 
THE JOURNEY TO NEW PASTURES IS INEVITABLY BESET WITH DANGERS 
IN SOME PLACES SHEER DENSITY CAN BE FATAL 
NOWHERE IS THIS MORE SO THAN AT RIVER CROSSINGS 
SWIMMING ACROSS THESE FAST FLOWING WATERS IS DESPERATELY DIFFICULT 
BUT THE SUPER HERD MUST DO SO TO REACH NEW PASTURES 
AT FIRST THE WILDEBEEST CROWD THE BANK IN SEARCH OF A PLACE TO CROSS 
IN SOME PLACES THE SHAPE OF THE LAND 
FUNNELS THE WILDEBEEST DOWN TO THE WATER 
THESE ARE CROSSING POINTS 
WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN USED BY THE SUPER HERD FOR GENERATIONS 
AS THE WILDEBEEST GATHER ON THE BANKS THE CRUSH BECOMES INTENSE 
AND THE ANIMALS ARE TORN BETWEEN FEAR 
AND THE NEED TO CROSS 
EVENTUALLY ONE ANIMAL TAKES THE PLUNGE 
AND THE ENTIRE HERD FOLLOWS IT 
BUT THE CURRENT IS MUCH STRONGER THAN IT LOOKS 
SOME ANIMALS ARE SWEPT PAST THE ONLY EASY LANDING PLACE 
THEY'LL HAVE TO SCRAMBLE OUT WHERE THEY CAN 
THESE ARE TRAPPED 
THERE IS NO ESCAPE HERE 
WHILE SOME ARE TRYING TO CLAMBER UP WALLS OF MUD 
OTHERS BEHIND ARE STILL PLUNGING INTO THE RIVER 
THE SUPER HERD IS UNSTOPPABLE 
SOME WILDEBEEST ARE FORCED UNDER THE WATER IN THE CRUSH 
OTHERS ARE GRABBED BY CROCODILES 
AT LAST SOME FIND A NARROW GAP IN THE BANK 
BUT AS HUNDREDS OF WILDEBEEST TRY TO SQUEEZE INTO THIS NARROW EXIT 
ANOTHER DEADLY BOTTLENECK FORMS 
MEMBERSHIP OF THE SUPER HERD HAS A HIGH PRICE 
SOME ANIMALS ARE EXHAUSTED 
THEY GIVE UP AND TURN BACK 
BUT THE SUPER HERD AS A WHOLE DOESN'T RETREAT 
THE WILDEBEEST INSTINCT TO STAY TOGETHER 
FORCES THEM TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD 
AT LAST WITH INTENSE PRESSURE MOUNTING FROM BEHIND 
SOME OF THE HERD MANAGE TO GET UP THE BANK 
THIS SINGLE CROSSING HAS COST THE LIVES OF NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS 
THE WILDEBEEST WILL CONTINUE TO CROSS LIKE THIS FOR DAYS 
EVEN WEEKS 
COMPARED TO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THAT GET THROUGH 
THESE CASUALTIES ARE TINY 
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE POWER OF THE SUPER HERD 
WHATEVER THE DANGERS ITS SHEER MASS WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL 
AND IT'S NOT JUST ONE STRATEGY THAT MAKES WILDEBEEST SO SUCCESSFUL 
IT'S EVERYTHING THEY DO 
ULTIMATELY IT'S THE SHEER NUMBERS THAT ENABLES THE SUPER HERD 
TO TRIUMPH OVER THE HAZARDS OF LIFE ON THE SAVANNAHS
