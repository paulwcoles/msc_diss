HELPING A YOUNG COUPLE TAKE THOSE FIRST STEPS ON THE PROPERTY LADDER 
YOU FINALLY THROW AWAY THE RENT BOOKS AND TAKE THE FIRST LEAP ONTO THE LADDER 
BUT DOM SOMETIMES THAT FIRST STEP CAN BE VERY DAUNTING HOW MUCH MONEY DO I HAVE TO SPEND 
WHERE IS THE BEST LOCATION WE MEET A COUPLE OF FIRST TIME BUYERS WHO NEED OUR HELP 
WE'RE GONNA GIVE THEM MOTIVATION INSPIRATION 
AND SOME DIRECTION AND ALSO GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO TRY 
BEFORE THEY BUY 
ANDREA ALLEN AND DAVE PATERSON TORE UP THEIR RENT BOOKS 
AND MOVED BACK HOME TO THEIR MUMS WHAT A CUSHY NUMBER 
THEY WANT TO GET ONTO THE FIRST RUNG OF THE PROPERTY LADDER 
BUT THEY'RE HAVING NO LUCK IN FINDING WHAT THEY WANT WITHIN THEIR BUDGET AND THE RIGHT AREA 
THEY NEED EXTRA STORAGE FOR DAVID 
WHO PLAYS IN A LOCAL BAND AND HAS LOADS OF INSTRUMENTS TO STORE 
DOMINIC COP A LOAD OF THAT 
CAN YOU FEEL IT COP A LOAD OF THAT 
WHAT SORT OF ENGLISH IS THAT GET YOUR HANDS AROUND THAT I CAN FEEL THE LOVE IN THE AIR 
I FEEL SOMETHING IN THE AIR IT'S NOT LOVE 
THERE SHOULD BE LOADS FROM THIS DIRECTION 
BECAUSE DAVE AND ANDREA YOU'VE BEEN DATING FOR 
ABOUT TWELVE MONTHS NOW TWELVE MONTHS O. K. 
CUPID IS WORKING HIS MAGIC YOU WANT TO MOVE IN TOGETHER 
LOOK THEY'RE HOLDING HANDS I KNOW I'M FEELING LEFT OUT 
DON'T LET US STOP YOU 
BUT AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE LIVING NOT TOGETHER BUT WITH YOUR 
I'M LIVING WITH MY MUM THAT'S NOT ROMANTIC 
I JUST LEFT UNI AND JUST COME BACK TO BRUM AND YOU'RE WITH YOUR MUM AS WELL YEAH 
AFTER RENTING SHE GOT BURGLED 
NOT VERY ROMANTIC AT ALL YOU'RE LIVING WITH YOUR PARENTS 
CAN I STOP YOU BOTH THERE 
YOU'RE WHAT TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR 
YOU BOTH LIVE WITH MUM COOKING WASHING BUS FARE IF YOU NEED TO BORROW SOME MONEY 
WHAT IS WRONG WITH STAYING WITH MUM I'D LOVE TO SOME THINGS ARE GREAT 
BUT SOMETIMES YOU WANT A BIT OF PRIVACY YOU JUST WANT YOUR OWN PROPERTY A BIT OF EQUITY 
YOU WANT TO MOVE TOGETHER THAT'S THE IDEA 
WHAT IS IT THIS PROPERTY YOU'RE GOING TO BUY HOPEFULLY FINGERS CROSSED 
WHAT IS IT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING IN A RESPECTABLE AREA 
BUT SOMEWHERE QUITE BIG HOPEFULLY THREE BEDROOMS 
WE MIGHT WANT TO RENT A ROOM OUT 
HELP US PAY THE MORTGAGE A BIT OF EXTRA MONEY 
RIGHT AND WHAT WOULD THE OTHER BEDROOM BE FOR 
I'M A MUSICIAN AND SOUND ENGINEER I DO LOT OF RECORDING 
SO I'D CONVERT IT AND SOUNDPROOF IT MAKING A LITTLE MINI STUDIO 
MMM DO A BIT OF GUITAR TEACHING 
O. K. HE'S GOT NINE NINE GUITARS YOU'VE GOT NINE GUITARS NINE 
HE'S GOT NINE GUITARS AND AMPLIFIERS AND PEDALS AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
OBVIOUSLY DAVE SAID HE WANTS SOMETHING THAT'S BIG ENOUGH TO HOUSE HIS GUITARS 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE IGNORE DAVE FOR A SECOND WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE 
AS THE LADY OF THE HOUSE 
BASICALLY JUST SOMEWHERE THAT'S AGAIN IN A NICER AREA 
AND ONE THAT'S GOT A REASONABLE SIZE KITCHEN NOT A SMALL SCULLERY 
WE'VE SEEN DIFFERENT HOUSES AND SOME OF THEM HAVE VERY TINY TINY ROOMS 
LIKE THE THIRD BEDROOM IS THE SIZE OF A SHOEBOX 
RIGHT O. K. NOW I'M IMAGINING THE MONEY SIDE ISN'T GOING TO BE REALLY HUGE 
NO IT'S THE FIRST PROPERTY 
SO WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE SOME COMPROMISES BETWEEN SPACE AND AREA 
WHAT'S THE BUDGET WHAT ARE WE TALKING 
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE O. K. NOT A BRILLIANT BUDGET 
FIRST TIME BUYERS BUT THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE IN YOUR SITUATION 
GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING US TO FIND FOR THAT 
I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO SAY AN APARTMENT NOT A HOUSE 
BUT YOU KNOW YOU FIRE AWAY WE'D SOONER GET A HOUSE TO BE HONEST 
WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT APARTMENTS IS THE FACT THAT YOU NEVER OWN THE LAND BUT IF WE GET A HOUSE 
WE'RE NOT EXPECTING OUR DREAM HOUSE OBVIOUSLY FOR THAT BUDGET 
BUT IF WE CAN GET SOMEWHERE FAIRLY BIG MAYBE WITH A BIT OF LAND 
WHERE YOU COULD BUILD AN EXTENSION 
LAND BIG BEDROOMS BIG KITCHEN 
KNOW YES AND A HOUSE 
O. K. NOW YOU SAID ABOUT A POSH AND A NICE SENSIBLE AREA 
WHERE ARE YOU THINKING 
ANYTHING SAFE THERE'S UP AND COMING AREAS KINGS NORTON 
IT'S VERY PRETTY AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BOTH BEEN LOOKING FOR 
ABOUT TWO MONTHS NOW TWO THREE MONTHS YEAH 
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAVEN'T FOUND ANYWHERE 
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING VERY INTENSIVELY 
WE'RE TOO FUSSY HE SAID FUSSY 
IT WORRIES ME I TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO 
WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT THERE 
AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND THREE PROPERTIES THAT WILL BE MUSIC TO YOUR EYES WHEN YOU SEE THEM 
AND SEE HOW WE SEE WE DO DOM 
WISH US LUCK BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT A PROBLEM HERE 
YES YOU'LL BE LUCKY TO GET A BOX OF CHOCOLATES LET ALONE BOURNVILLE 
RIGHT KRIS COME HERE YEAH WHAT'S THAT LET'S FACE FACTS 
WHAT THEY WANT AND HOW MUCH THEY'VE GOT TO SPEND LET'S CLEAR OFF 
WE CAN BE HOME IN A COUPLE OF HOURS 
WE'LL BREAK THEIR LITTLE HEARTS 
IT'S YOUR LAST CHANCE NO 
DOMINIC THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING 
WE'VE FACED WORSE WE CAN HANDLE THIS 
I ADMIRE YOUR DEDICATION ONE TRIES 
I THINK IF WE SPLIT UP COVER AS MUCH GROUND AS POSSIBLE 
MEET UP WHEN THE BIG HAND TOUCHES THE LITTLE HAND AND SHOW EACH OTHER WHAT WE'VE FOUND 
ALL RIGHT GOOD LUCK SEE YOU LATER ON 
SO WHAT COULD ANDREA AND DAVE GET AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR THEIR MONEY 
WELL IN BEAUFORT THEY COULD HAVE THIS THREE BEDROOMED REFURBISHED COTTAGE ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAND 
OR WHAT ABOUT THIS SIX BED TERRACED PROPERTY NEAR BERWICK UPON TWEED 
PRIME SPOT FOR COMMUTERS AND A SNIP AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAND 
OR THERE'S THIS THREE BEDROOMED DETACHED BUNGALOW IN NORTHEAST SCOTLAND 
LARGE SPACIOUS ROOMS AND IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR OFFERS OVER ONE TWENTY FIVE K. 
BEARING IN MIND THAT ANDREA WANTS A LARGE HOME FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAND 
WE HEAD OUT TO SOUTH BIRMINGHAM HOME OF JASPER CARROTT AND OF COURSE SPAGHETTI JUNCTION 
SO WHILE I CHECK WHAT'S ON THE MARKET WITH THE LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS 
DOMINIC TRIES TO GET A FEW POINTERS FROM THE LOCALS 
REMEMBER THE FIRST HOUSE YOU BOUGHT 
YES IT WAS FIFTEEN BEAUCHAMP ROAD IN BILLESLEY 
TELL US ABOUT IT HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR IT 
WELL THAT WAS YEARS AGO IT WAS TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
IN YOUR LIFE YOU'VE NEVER EVER EVER BOUGHT A HOUSE NO WHY 
WE'VE HAD TOO MANY KIDS 
HOW MANY KIDS HAVE YOU HAD ER 
GO ON GO ON HE'S SMILING EIGHT KIDS AND TWO WIVES 
I'M NOT SURPRISED YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT A HOUSE 
FOR THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY WHAT AM I LIKELY TO FIND IN SOUTH BIRMINGHAM 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAND YOU CAN TAKE ME OUT FOR A NIGHT 
HELLO THERE HELLO NICE TO MEET YOU 
PROPERTY YES IS ONLY EXPENSIVE THE DAY YOU BUY IT 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SO RIGHT 
I AM HOUSE HUNTING ON BEHALF OF A LOVELY FIRST TIME COUPLE 
THEY WANT A THREE BEDROOM PROPERTY 
HE'S IN A BAND AND WANTS ONE ROOM FOR HIS INSTRUMENTS 
A ROOM TO RENT OUT POSSIBLY AND A ROOM FOR THEM 
AND A GOOD SIZED KITCHEN 
AND SPENDING NO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THE HOUSE BACK IN SIXTY EIGHT CAN'T REMEMBER 
THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED 
HOW BIG IS THE THIRD BEDROOM 
PEOPLE SAY THIRD BEDROOM IT'S A WALK IN WARDROBE 
QUITE SMALL WE HAVE ALL THE FLOOR PLANS ON THERE 
AND THE SIZES ARE ON THERE 
THAT'S NOT THAT SMALL IS IT NO 
I THINK THAT'S A POSSIBILITY 
WE'RE DOING SCRAMBLED EGGS ON TOAST 
I'M COMING WITH YOU TWO COME ON SCRAMBLED EGGS ON TOAST 
IT'S A NICE PROPERTY BUT TWO BEDROOMS 
I'M DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR THREE SO REJECTION 
IF WE COULD SET UP VIEWINGS FOR THESE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I CAN MAKE A BETTER JUDGMENT 
IS THAT ALL RIGHT O. K. NO PROBLEM 
AH KRISTIAN 
AH TWO SHINY BONNETS 
YOU KNOW I SAID TO YOU WE SHOULD HAVE JUMPED ON A BUS AND GONE HOME 
YES WITH HINDSIGHT YES I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION 
I'M INCLINED TO AGREE DOMINIC I'VE LOOKED AT LOADS OF PROPERTIES AND HARDLY ANY OF THEM ARE SUITABLE 
I'VE DONE THE ROUNDS AND COME UP WITH ONE JUST ONE 
HAVE A LOOK AT THAT THOUGH I THINK IT'S QUITE A GOOD PROPERTY 
IT LOOKS GOOD THEY'LL PROBABLY PICK HOLES IN IT BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET EVERYTHING 
NO I LIKE THAT I'M GOING WITH THAT I WANT A SECOND OPINION ON THIS 
NINETEEN THIRTIES GREAT PROPERTY BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THAT 
BIG GARDEN SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THUMBS UP OR THUMBS DOWN 
DEFINITELY THUMBS UP GOOD 
O. K. AND THE ONE THAT I'M TRULY MADLY DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH IS THIS ONE HERE 
THERE IS A VERY OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGE WITH THAT 
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE WILD CARD AND I'M WILLING TO PUT MY HEAD ON THE LINE 
ON YOUR HEAD BE IT ON MY HEAD BE IT SO WE HAVE THE THREE PROPERTIES LET'S START THE VIEWINGS 
RIGHT PROPERTY ONE IS OUR JOINT CHOICE 
A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE IN THE SUBURB OF KINGS NORTON 
IT'S JUST A FIVE MINUTE WALK TO THE LOCAL VILLAGE GREEN 
NOW THIS MAY BE A NINETEEN THIRTIES TERRACE BUT IT HAS A GREAT LAYOUT 
IT HAS ALL THE GOODIES THEY ASKED FOR AND IT WOULD BE AN IDEAL BUY FOR OUR FIRST TIME BUYERS 
WELL DAVE AND ANDREA I DO WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT DOMINIC AND I HAVE WORKED NOT JUST HARD 
LIKE A HOUND DOG NOT JUST REALLY HARD BUT REALLY REALLY HARD 
TO FIND PROPERTIES TO SUIT YOU SO YOU SHOULD 
WE DIDN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT DOM DID WE 
I WAS VERY TEMPTED KRIS HE WAS I HAD TO PULL HIM BACK 
BUT WE STAND HERE PROPERTY ONE IS A JOINT CHOICE WE PICKED THIS TOGETHER AND THE REASON IS 
WE THINK IT SUITS YOU PERFECTLY 
IT'S GOT THE ACCOMMODATION SPACE YOU'RE AFTER IT'S A VERY SMART NINETEEN THIRTIES TERRACED PROPERTY 
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FALL IN LOVE NOT JUST WITH EACH OTHER BUT WITH THE HOUSE 
DAVE WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
IT LOOKS QUITE BIG ACTUALLY FROM THE OUTSIDE BIG WINDOWS LOTS OF LIGHT 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN WELL MAINTAINED 
SO LET'S SEE INSIDE AND TOUCH WOOD IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT 
YES LET'S TOUCH WOOD 
STEADY STEADY WHAT YOU THINK 
IT'S A NICE AREA AS WELL 
IT'S REALLY QUIET YEAH LET'S TELL YOU WHAT EXCITED US 
FIRSTLY IT'S VERY VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY BUT I HAVE GOT TO WARN YOU 
THE HOUSE IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE KRISTIAN STRUCTURALLY IT'S O. K. 
COSMETICALLY IT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT 
BEFORE HE DEFENDS HIMSELF HAVE A LOOK SAY WHAT YOU THINK 
EXCELLENT THANK YOU THANKS 
OH DEAR WE KNOW WHO'S GOT THE STRUCTURAL FAULTS DON'T WE YES 
IT'S A NICE BLACK AND WHITE EXTERIOR 
FOR OUR FIRST HOUSE I REALLY DO THINK WE'VE BACKED A WINNER 
I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE DONE YEAH OH GOSH IT'S PINK 
YEAH IT'S PURPLE 
IT'S A LOVELY COLOUR I DON'T LIKE THE PLASTERING 
I DON'T LIKE THE CARPET BUT WE CAN SORT THAT 
THEY DON'T LIKE THE PLASTERING THE CARPETS WE'RE OFF TO A BAD START 
IT'S A NICE BIG LIVING ROOM 
IT IS ISN'T IT 
I LIKE THE WINDOWS YOU GET LOTS OF LIGHT IT'S ALL DOUBLE GLAZED 
IT IS SLIGHTLY ON THE EMPTY SIDE THIS HOUSE 
I WONDER IF THEY CAN PICTURE WHAT THEY CAN DO TO MAKE IT THEIR HOME 
IT'S A NICE BIG AREA FOR A DINING TABLE AS WELL YEAH 
NICE BIG DINING AREA 
BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN EX STUDENT WHO PLAYS THE GUITAR THAT COULD BE HIS STUDIO 
ALL HE'S GOING TO WANT IS DINE OFF A TRAY YEAH 
IT'S GOT A LOVELY HUGE GARDEN M. M. M. 
YOU COULD EXTEND IT 
EXTENDING IS ACTUALLY A VERY VERY GOOD IDEA ESPECIALLY IN THIS PROPERTY THEY COULD DO IT 
IT'S GOT A LITTLE CUPBOARD YOU AND YOUR CUPBOARDS 
I'LL LOCK YOU IN THERE WOMEN AND CUPBOARDS THEY'VE GOT TO LOOK IN THEM 
VERY SMALL KITCHEN THIS IS TINY 
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE SCULLERY AGAIN YEAH 
THAT IS THE REAL DOWNFALL HERE THE KITCHEN IS A BIT ON THE SMALL SIDE 
GOT A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS BUT THAT'S OUR STUMBLING BLOCK 
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING IT'S GOT FRIDGE COOKER WASHING MACHINE 
IT'S WORK SPACE THOUGH 
THAT KITCHEN THERE FUNCTIONS CURRENTLY FOR A FAMILY 
BEAR IN MIND HE IS AN EX STUDENT SO EVERYTHING HE COOKS COMES OUT A KETTLE IS DEHYDRATED 
PING DONE YEAH 
OOH IT'S A NICE BIG GARDEN 
OH I DO HATE THAT WORD NICE 
SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FOR A LONG WHILE 
YOU COULD HAVE A SHED AT THE BOTTOM AND KEEP YOUR EQUIPMENT 
YOU'RE JOKING 
NICE LENGTH QUITE HIGH FENCES 
THEY'RE IMPRESSED BY THE GARDEN SIZE 
NOT SURPRISED THEY HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN THE POND YET 
THEY HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN THE GNOME AT THE END 
NICE MATURE PLANTS AS WELL YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO DO TOO MUCH TO KEEP UP NO EASY TO MAINTAIN 
JUST MOW AND AS IT IS 
HOW'S YOUR ASTROTURF GOING IS IT STILL HARD TO KEEP 
I GOT FED UP WITH IT AND CONCRETED IT OVER OH WELL DONE 
I LIKE THE BANISTERS AS WELL 
IT SEEMS TO BE THE SALE HIT OF THE DAY IF IT'S GOT A BANISTER OR NOT 
DECENT SIZED LANDING 
DECENT LANDING WHAT IS SHE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER 
IT'S A SMALL LOOKING BATHROOM TO BE HONEST 
IT IS YEAH IS THERE A SHOWER IN THERE YEAH 
THERE'S A BATH AND A SHOWER AND A SINK AND A TOILET 
IT'S ALL THERE YEAH YEAH 
OOH IT'S NICE BIG BEDROOM 
THIS WOULD BE THE SECOND BEDROOM BIG WINDOWS TO LET A LOT OF LIGHT IN 
YOU CAN PUT A GARAGE DOWN THE BOTTOM AS WELL 
YEAH PRETTY BIG FISH POND 
IF THEY THINK THE POND'S BIG WAIT TILL THEY SEE THE FISH 
MASTER BEDROOM THESE PEOPLE MUST LOVE GREEN 
WHAT IS WRONG WITH GREEN DOMINIC 
YOU KNOW IT SUITS YOUR TEETH I CAN'T SEE IT NOT SUITING THAT ROOM 
I LIKE THE VIEW 
PRETTY IT'S NOT TOO BAD IS IT 
IT'S ALL RIGHT 
IT'S AN ALL RIGHT SIZE THIS ROOM IT IS QUITE BIG AND YOU'VE GOT 
LOOK AT THE CUPBOARDS THEY PROBABLY DON'T COME WITH THE HOUSE 
IT'S GOT CUPBOARDS ON THIS SIDE PLUS YOU COULD BUILD INTO THE RECESSES 
HAVE YOU GOT EARACHE I'M JUST HOLDING JUST O. K. 
OH DEAR A BOX ROOM 
THE THIRD BEDROOM AND THE RESPONSE IS 
OH DEAR 
THIS IS THE BIT WE'RE FALLING DOWN ON IS GETTING A THIRD BEDROOM ISN'T IT 
YEAH YOU WOULDN'T GET A BED IN HERE WOULD YOU I KNOW 
FOR A START IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A BEDROOM 
THIRD BEDROOM IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A BEDROOM 
IT'S GOING TO BE A STORAGE ROOM FOR MUSICAL EQUIPMENT 
WOULD YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SPECIALLY MADE BED 
IT WOULD FIT A CHILD'S BED 
KIDS HAVE NOT BEEN DISCUSSED 
THIS HAS NOT BEEN YOU KNOW NO ONE'S 
COULD YOU FIT YOUR WORK STUFF IN HERE 
COULD YOU HAVE A GUITAR AND A SETTEE OR A MIXING DESK CRAMPED 
HE MAY BE WORRIED ABOUT GETTING HIS TEN GUITARS IN 
ALL HE'S GOT TO DO IS DOWNSIZE HIS GUITARS TO BANJOS 
I WONDER IF THERE'S ANY ATTIC SPACE 
WE COULD JUST PUT UP STAIRS GO UP TO AN ATTIC MAYBE 
OH DOM WHAT A TEPID RESPONSE 
NOT HALF WE NEED TURN THIS INTO THE HOUSE OF LOVE WE NEED TO TURN THE HEAT UP 
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN SORT OUT SOME OF YOUR GRUMBLES 
ONE OF YOUR FIRST THINGS YOU NOTICED WAS THIS WALL HERE ITS UNDULATING TEXTURE 
IT'S LIKE A REALLY MILD ARTEX 
IT IS LIKE A MILD ARTEX 
TO GET RID OF THAT BASICALLY ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS STOP AND FILL 
YOU BASICALLY SMOOTH IT OVER SAND IT DOWN AND EVENTUALLY ALL THOSE RIPPLES WILL DISAPPEAR 
YOU WILL HAVE A LOVELY FRESH WALL YOU CAN PAINT IN ANY PALETTE COLOUR THAT YOU WANT 
BUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM OR THE SMALLER PROBLEM WAS THIS KITCHEN SCULLERY 
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU USE THAT WORD 
THE BIG SOLUTION WOULD BE TO GO OUT THERE LIKE YOUR NEIGHBOUR AND BUILD AN EXTENSION PRICEY 
FIRST TIME BUYER WE SHOULD UTILISE WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE 
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A SMALL KITCHEN IT'S JUST ABOUT HOW YOU LAY OUT THE KITCHEN ITSELF 
VERY DAFT IDEAS LIKE A SHELF BEHIND THE MICROWAVE 
HOW CAN YOU ACCESS THAT 
YOU'VE GOT A WINE RACK HERE WHERE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY GET THE BOTTLES OUT 
QUITE GOOD FOR DAVE 
OR IF DOM COMES AROUND BECAUSE HE DOES HELP HIMSELF 
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS RIP ALL THIS OUT AND GET A PROPER PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN PLANNER IN HERE 
AND HE WILL UTILISE THE SPACE PERFECTLY AND YOU WILL HAVE A WORKING KITCHEN 
I HEARD YOU SAYING TO ANDREA INSIDE YOU WERE CHATTING AWAY 
YOU SAID ABOUT PUTTING UP A GARAGE DOWN HERE YEAH YOU WERE ACTUALLY READING MY MIND 
IT'S GOT THE POTENTIAL HASN'T IT 
YOU GOT THE SPACE YOU'RE FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE HOUSE 
FACE FACTS THAT'S A MID TERRACED HOUSE 
IF YOU AND YOUR MATES ARE GIGGING YOU GET BACK LATE 
YOU WANT TO BRING ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT IN 
YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER ABOUT PUTTING NINE GUITARS IN THE BEDROOM 
YOU DON'T LIVE TOGETHER YET 
WHEN YOU FINISH A GIG AT THE END OF THE NIGHT AND YOU PULL UP OUTSIDE IN YOUR VAN 
AND ALL YOUR LONG HAIRED MATES STINKING OF KEBABS AND BEER 
AND SWEAT AFTER A LONG HARD NIGHT JAMMING AWAY 
SHE IS GOING TO GET THE HUMP 
CAST YOUR EYES OVER THERE 
SEE THAT YEAH THAT BRINGS YOU DOWN THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
IT IS A LITTLE BIT OVERGROWN 
YOU'D HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP YEAH THAT'S DO ABLE 
PUT A WORKSHOP HERE 
YOU GOT ACCESS THERE YOU CAN KEEP YOUR EQUIPMENT HERE 
YOU CAN DO YOUR GIGGING PRACTISING 
YOU GOT AN ALARM ON THE HOUSE EXTEND THAT SO THE ALARM IS ON THIS BUILDING 
PUT SOME PASSIVE INFRARED FLOODLIGHTS AND KEEP IT AWAY FROM THE HOUSE 
YOU'LL KEEP HER INDOORS SWEET AS A NUT 
OR I COULD KEEP ANDREA IN HERE AND I'LL HAVE THE HOUSE 
YOU'RE A BRAVE MAN WHEN SHE'S NOT AROUND I'LL TELL HER DON'T WORRY 
I'LL BEAT YOU TO IT I'M GONNA TELL HER NOW 
COME ON FAIR ENOUGH 
WOULD YOU REALLY NEED A BIG KITCHEN 
YEAH WHAT WOULD YOU COOK A MUSICIAN APART FROM ROCK CAKES ROCK CAKES 
ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO DOB HIM IN HERE 
WHEN I SHOWED HIM THE GARDEN SAID YOU COULD PUT A WORKSHOP THERE 
HE SAID I'LL KEEP ANDREA IN HERE AND I'LL GIG IN THE HOUSE 
OH YOU WOULDN'T YES HE SAID HE WASN'T SCARED OF YOU EITHER 
MORE CONTROVERSY NOW IT'S TIME FOR GUESS THE PRICE 
WHEN DOMINIC AND I SHOW YOU A PROPERTY WE WANT YOU TO GUESS THE VALUE OF THAT HOUSE 
BECAUSE HE WAS SO HORRIBLE TO YOU I'LL LET YOU GO FIRST 
WHAT D'YOU RECKON FIRST STAB 
ONE HUNDRED TWELVE ONE HUNDRED TWELVE INTERESTING 
O. K. DAVE WHAT ABOUT YOU IT'S GOT TO BE MORE THAN THAT I'D SAY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ISH 
MORE LOOKING FROM THE OUTSIDE BUT IT'S QUITE SMALL INSIDE 
QUITE SMALL YOU GOT A LANDING STRIP OF A GARDEN AND A BIG POND 
THREE BEDS EVERYTHING ELSE 
O. K. LOOK YOU ARE ACTUALLY CLOSER ON THIS ONE BUT YOU BOTH UNDERVALUED IT 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
SURPRISED US WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD VALUE 
IT'S A THREE BEDROOM PROPERTY IN A NICE AREA 
THAT ONE WAS OUR JOINT CHOICE 
THE NEXT HOUSE IS MY FAVOURITE 
I THINK YOU'RE BOTH GOING TO LOVE IT 
ALL RIGHT DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP 
IF THIS IS THE PROPERTY FOR ANDREA AND DAVE THERE'S A FEW THINGS THEY SHOULD BEAR IN MIND 
THEY SHOULD CHECK WITH THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT 
TO SEE IF PERMISSION IS NEEDED FOR A GARAGE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN 
ALSO CHECK THAT LEGALLY THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BRING A VEHICLE TO THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY 
HERE'S MY FAVOURITE A THREE BED EDWARDIAN TERRACE IN THE COTTERIDGE AREA 
A GOOD SPOT FOR BUSES TRAINS SHOPS PARKS 
IT PAINS ME TO SAY I THINK DOMINIC'S RIGHT 
IT'S GOT LARGE ROOMS EDWARDIAN CHARACTER JUST WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR 
RIGHT HERE WE ARE AT MY CHOSEN FAVOURITE 
PROPERTY TWO LET ME TELL YOU WHY I THINK THIS IS SO SUITABLE 
ALL ALONG YOU SAID YOU WANTED BIG ROOMS 
HERE YOU'VE GOT THREE BIG BEDROOMS 
A BIG DINING ROOM A BIG LOUNGE A BIG KITCHEN EVEN A BIG DOWNSTAIRS LAVVY 
THEY'RE ALL ON THE LARGE SIDE 
SO YOU CANNOT MOAN ABOUT THAT 
BUT I WOULD SAY KRIS AND I PICKED UP ON THIS IN THE LAST HOUSE 
YOU ARE FIRST TIME BUYERS 
WE THOUGHT YOU PAID TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE TRIVIAL THINGS 
DECOR CARPETS COLOURING THAT SORT OF THING 
TRY AND GO IN HERE WITH AN OPEN MIND 
WHAT D'YOU THINK I THINK YOU'RE WARNING US ABOUT SOMETHING 
D'YOU NOT TRUST THIS MAN WHY NOT 
I'VE AN OPEN MIND JUST THE DECOR 
DON'T BE PUT OFF YOU'RE FIRST TIME BUYERS 
YOU WANT TO DO THINGS YOURSELF 
WHAT D'YOU THINK FROM THE OUTSIDE 
IT LOOKS NARROW BUT IT CAN BE DECEIVING SEEMS CRAMPED 
NARROW AND CRAMPED OVER TO YOU KRISTIAN 
IF YOU SAY IT'S BIG IT MUST GO BACK A LONG WAY 
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO PICK UP ON 
THE PARKING SPACE LOOKS A BIT LIMITED 
YOU'VE GOT A PARKING SPACE OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIT YOUR VAN THERE 
I DON'T HAVE A VAN I DON'T HAVE TO FIT IT THERE 
WHILE DOMINIC'S BEEN BIGGING UP THIS PROPERTY HE DIDN'T MENTION WHICH IS IMPORTANT THE LOCATION 
WE'RE IN COTTERIDGE VERY DESIRABLE PRICES GOING THROUGH THE ROOF 
AS FIRST TIME BUYERS THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PROPERTY INVESTMENT 
SO DON'T LOOK AT THE DECORATION LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING FOR YOUR MONEY 
GET IN THERE AND SAVAGE IT DO US PROUD 
IN A GOOD WAY NOT IN A BAD WAY LET'S GO GET THE HEADPHONES ON 
YES LET'S DO IT 
O. K. DOM ALL THAT LOVE IN THE AIR 
DO YOU FEEL IT RUBBING OFF ON YOU 
I'M GOING TO GET BROMIDE PUT IN YOUR TEA 
HONESTLY 
STIFF DOOR 
IT GOES STRAIGHT INTO THE UM DINING ROOM THEN 
I WOULDN'T LIKE THAT IF THAT WAS INTO A LIVING ROOM THE KITCHEN'S PROBABLY AT THE BACK 
RATHER THAN HAVING THIS AS A LIVING ROOM THEY'VE DONE IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND 
IT'S O. K. I SUPPOSE IT'S BETTER THAN PEOPLE WALKING IN WHILE YOU'RE SITTING WATCHING T. V. 
YES D'YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW WHERE SHE'S COMING FROM WITH THAT 
THERE'S THE LIVING ROOM YEAH 
IT'S A NICE SIZE ACTUALLY 
NOT TOO BAD 
STRONG CARPET REALLY ISN'T IT 
YES YOU'D HAVE TO CHANGE THAT CAN WE DO ANYTHING TO PLEASE THESE TWO 
I COULDN'T LOOK AT THAT I COULDN'T LIVE WITH IT 
IT'S BIGGER INSIDE THAN IT LOOKS FROM THE OUTSIDE I THINK IT GOES BACK A FAIR WAY 
YES I DON'T THINK IT'S CENTRALLY HEATED IS IT 
IT FEELS A BIT COLD 
MOAN MOAN MOAN MOAN MOAN 
SHALL WE LOOK AT THE KITCHEN THAT'S MORE OF A KITCHEN THAT'S ALL RIGHT 
IT'S A BIT BIGGER A BIT NARROW 
IT'S LIKE A GALLEY STYLE ISN'T IT 
THIS IS A BIGGER KITCHEN THAN THE LAST ONE 
ALSO THE UNITS ARE MUCH NEWER 
IT'S NICELY FITTED 
IT'S NOT BEEN CHIPPED AT ALL 
THERE'S A LOT LESS WORK REQUIRED IN THIS HOUSE 
THAT'S THE THING WHICH I'M HOPING WILL SELL IT TO THEM YEP 
GOOD WATER PRESSURE AS WELL 
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE GOOD WATER PRESSURE 
NOTHING WORSE THAN WORKING WITH A LITTLE SQUIRT 
BATHROOM DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM AS WELL 
A LAVVY NEXT TO THE KITCHEN IS IDEAL 
POP YOUR TOAST IN NIP TO THE LAVVY COME OUT IT'S READY 
IT'S NOT VERY HYGIENIC IS IT 
TO HAVE A BATHROOM NEXT TO THE KITCHEN 
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP IT CLEAN YOU'RE ALL RIGHT 
I DON'T KNOW IT WOULDN'T BE MY FIRST CHOICE 
IT'S A BIGGER BATHROOM 
AND IT LOOKS IT'S NICELY TILED AND IT'S THE SAME WHITE SUITE YEAH 
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO MUCH TO THAT OR THE KITCHEN AT ALL 
NO IT WOULD BE ONE JOB LESS TO DO 
YEAH LET'S HAVE A MOOCH AT THE GARDEN 
A MOOCH I THINK HE MEANS A GANDER 
IT'S LOOKING LIKE A SMALL GARDEN 
IT IS A SMALL GARDEN BUT LET'S FACE IT HE'S AN EX STUDENT 
HE'S A BUSY MUSICIAN SHE'S BUSY ON HER COURSE 
THEY DON'T WANT SOMETHING THAT TAKES YEARS TO MOW 
THEY WANT SOMETHING MANAGEABLE WELL WE GOT IT FOR THEM YEAH 
IS THIS LIKE A SHARED YARD 
UM I DON'T REALLY LIKE THAT 
SO PEOPLE CAN WALK THROUGH YOUR SORT OF GARDEN 
THE ALLEYWAY SHARED ACCESS IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL 
TO BE HONEST I'M NOT LIKING AND NOT LIKING THE POKY GARDEN 
YOU CAN'T REALLY INVITE PEOPLE BACK HERE COULD YOU 
SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT WHEN SHE WALKED IN BECAUSE THERE WAS NO HALLWAY 
SHE WASN'T THE LOUNGE FELT COLD 
THE KITCHEN NOT IN LOVE WITH AND THE BACK GARDEN OH WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE FRIENDS ROUND HERE 
NO NO NO NO YOU FORGOT THE LAVVY NEXT TO THE KITCHEN NO GOOD COULDN'T DO THAT YEP 
THE GARDEN 
I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE GARDEN 
I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE KITCHEN EITHER 
I CAN TELL YOU DON'T LIKE THE KITCHEN AND SHE'S SO FUSSY 
FOR THE WILD CARD LET'S JUST SEE IF THE BALMORAL ESTATE'S ON THE MARKET 
GOT CREDIT NORMALLY YOU BORROW MY PHONE FOR THAT 
YOU'RE RIGHT CAN I BORROW YOURS I CAN'T GET OVER THE CARPETS 
I KEEP LOOKING AT THE CARPET THINKING AARGH 
IT'S A BIT STEEP WOOAH YEAH 
STEEP STEPS IS WHAT GETS YOU FROM ONE FLOOR UP TO THE OTHER 
IF IT WAS REALLY STEEP THEY COULD JUST HAVE A LADDER 
BEDROOMS OH CREAKY FLOOR OH 
CREAKY FLOOR THAT WAS THE LAMINATE FLOOR 
I THOUGHT SHE WOULD LIKE THAT TO GET AWAY FROM THE CARPET IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE CARPET YES 
SHE MIGHT LIKE THE LAMINATE FLOOR BUT OF COURSE NO IT'S CREAKY 
I QUITE LIKE THIS ROOM ACTUALLY 
I LIKE WHAT THEY'VE DONE WITH THE MIRRORS ON THESE CUPBOARDS 
YEAH I BET YOU DO 
ARE YOU SAYING I'M VAIN 
M. M. M. H. M. M. WHY IS THERE A GLASS BIT ABOVE THE DOOR 
THAT WILL BE TO LET LIGHT INTO THE HALLWAY PERHAPS 
THAT'S A RADIATOR OH NO IT'S A PLUG IN THING YEP AN ELECTRIC ONE 
A SECOND BEDROOM 
IT'S A GOOD SIZED ROOM EVEN THOUGH IT'S A LITTLE BIT DARKER 
YEAH BUT EASILY YOU'VE GOT A DOUBLE BED IN THERE 
LOADS OF WALKING SPACE A FITTED CUPBOARD IN HERE AS WELL 
I WONDER WHAT SORT OF ROOM WE'VE GOT IN THERE SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK 
THAT CUPBOARD LEADS UP TO THE ATTIC QUITE HANDY 
WOW THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM HOW FAR DOES IT GO BACK 
THAT'S THE LOFT ACCESS AS WELL AH IS IT 
SO THERE'S A FAIR BIT OF STORAGE ROOM AND STUFF ISN'T THERE YEAH 
AND YOU CAN GET TO THE LOFT AS WELL 
WORRIED ABOUT THE SPACE SHALL WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE THIRD ROOM 
YES IS IT A BEDROOM OR A BOX ROOM 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
ACTUALLY YOU'VE GOT A FULL SIZED SINGLE BED IN HERE 
CUPBOARDS AND THERE'S STILL LOADS OF SPACE 
IS QUITE LONG ISN'T IT IT'S NOT BAD YEAH 
AAH HE'S HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD IT'S A SMALL ROOM BUT IT'S STILL QUITE A GOOD SIZE 
YEAH AND THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT OTHER PROPERTIES 
AND I THINK THAT IS THE BEST ONE THEY'VE SEEN SO FAR YEAH 
NOT AS LIGHT AS THE OTHER HOUSE 
NO BUT STILL IMPRESSIVE UPSTAIRS ACTUALLY 
I'M LIKING THE UPSTAIRS OF THIS HOUSE MORE SO THAN THE DOWNSTAIRS 
I DON'T THINK IT'S OVER YET I THINK THERE'S STILL LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL 
LET'S TELL THEM HOW WE'D IMPROVE THIS HOUSE THERE REALLY IS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL BY THE WAY 
YEAH COME ON 
YOU WERE QUITE NEGATIVE ABOUT THIS HALLWAY UPSTAIRS 
TELL ME WHAT IT IS YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT IT THERE'S A FEW THINGS 
BASICALLY IT FEELS REALLY SMALL AND NARROW AND IT FEELS REALLY DARK 
AS WELL SO I CAN'T IMAGINE GETTING ANYTHING UP 
BUT MAINLY BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK 
ALL YOUR COMMENTS ARE JUSTIFIED 
LET ME TELL YOU HOW EASY THAT WOULD BE TO RECTIFY 
THIS WALLPAPER IS CALLED BLOWN VINYL PULL THAT OFF 
MAKE GOOD ANY MARKS ON THE WALLS PAINT THAT A NICE PASTEL COLOUR 
A NICE BRIGHT LIGHTENING COLOUR LOOK AT THE CEILING 
IT'S SO HIGH PEOPLE HAVE IGNORED IT 
BUT A NICE EGGSHELL WHITE WOULD LIGHTEN THE WHOLE HALLWAY AS WELL 
THIS IS QUITE AN EXPENSIVE CARPET 
BUT I AGREE WITH YOU IT'S HESSIAN BACKED IT'S OLD FASHIONED IT DOESN'T REALLY BELONG HERE 
CERTAINLY A YOUNG COUPLE WOULDN'T HAVE IT 
LIFT THAT UP YOU'LL HAVE BEAUTIFUL FLOORBOARDS UNDERNEATH 
YOU SAND THOSE BACK YOU'D HAVE BARE WOOD 
IT WOULD LOOK ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL THE OTHER THING IS THESE DOORS 
IT'S AN EDWARDIAN HOUSE 
THESE ARE ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
YOU COULD REMOVE THESE HAVE THEM ACID DIPPED FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN EACH 
IT WOULD BRING THEM BACK TO BARE WOOD 
IF YOU DO THAT WITH THESE FRAMES YOU GET A STRONG 
PAINT STRIPPER ON THERE YOU'VE GOT SOLID ONE HUNDRED YEAR OLD DOORS AND FRAMES 
NICE HALLWAY NICE WALLS NICE CEILING 
YOU WOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS PLACE 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT 
I HAVEN'T SOLD IT TO YOU HAVE I 
I'M NOT COMPLETELY AGAINST IT 
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY WHAT I WOULD HAVE GONE FOR 
BUT I WILL BEAR IT IN MIND DAVE WHAT HAPPENED 
YOU DID YOUR HOUSE TOUR AND QUITE FRANKLY YOU WENT COLD ON IT 
WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BIT NEGATIVE PULLING UP IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
IT SEEMS REALLY NARROW AND THE WHOLE ROW LOOKS KIND OF DINGY 
I MEAN IT'S A NICE HOUSE ACTUALLY INSIDE LOTS OF ROOM 
BUT FIRST IMPRESSIONS WEREN'T GREAT AND IT WENT DOWN FROM THERE 
YEAH I THINK SO O. K. WELL LOOK 
THIS MIGHT GET A FROSTY RECEPTION AS WELL WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THIS HOUSE HAS NO CENTRAL HEATING 
WHAT IT DOES HAVE IS SOME GAS FIRES 
IT HAS GAS CONVECTION HEATERS AND IT ALSO HAS ELECTRIC PANEL HEATERS 
REALLY THAT COMBINATION IS NOT VERY ECONOMICAL 
SO IT'S GOING TO COST YOU MORE MONEY TO HEAT ALL OF THAT 
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO HERE IS INVEST AND HAVE A COMBINATION BOILER 
YOU WANT TO GET SOME RADIATORS IN HERE 
NOW FOR ALL OF THAT AND THE PLUMBER TO FIX IT IT'S GOING TO COST YOU AROUND ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
YEAH I CAN BELIEVE THAT YEAH IT SOUNDS LIKE A BIG CHUNK OF MONEY 
BUT IT'S WELL WORTH SPENDING ON IT AND YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE ON YOUR GAS BILLS AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF 
SO IT'S WORTH DOING YEAH I THINK IT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE YEAH 
BUT ULTIMATELY OF COURSE IT DEPENDS HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE LEFT OVER IF ANY WHEN YOU BUY THE HOUSE 
YEAH THAT'S THE THING YEAH RIGHT THE PRICE THIS WAY 
WELL THERE WE GO PROPERTY NUMBER TWO IT'S GUESS THE PRICE TIME 
YOU'RE SMILING 
NOW DAVE WAS CLOSEST ON THE LAST ONE 
BUT THEN CHRISTIAN DID BULLY YOU INTO PICKING FIRST DIDN'T HE YEAH 
O. K. WELL MAKE HIM PICK THE PRICE FIRST 
ZERO H. I DUNNO I'D PROBABLY SAY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE 
O. K. UM ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR 
INTERESTING WELL IT HAS TO BE SAID THE GIRL WITH THE HAIR HAS IT BECAUSE IT'S ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
YOU'RE ONLY ONE THOUSAND OUT SO NECK AND NECK BETWEEN YOU TWO ON GUESS THE PRICE 
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THAT WE'VE NOW SHOWN YOU TWO PROPERTIES ONE MORE TO GO GUESS WHAT 
MY CHOICE THE WILD CARD 
NOW IF ANDREA AND DAVE ARE TEMPTED THERE ARE FEW THINGS TO BEAR IN MIND 
THE PROPERTY IS OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD SO CHECK IF IT HAS A DAMP COURSE 
AND WHAT IF ANY GUARANTEES COME WITH THE HOUSE 
THE WILD CARD IS MY CHOICE 
IT'S A TWO BEDROOM FLAT IN A TIP TOP LOCATION MOSELEY 
WITH SPACIOUS WELL PROPORTIONED ROOMS PLUS THE PERFECT POSTCODE 
RENTING OUT A ROOM IN THIS PROPERTY WOULD BE NO PROBLEM AT ALL 
YOU KNOW I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE TROUBLE CONVINCING THEM OF THIS 
IT WAS CONVERTED INTO FLATS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IT DOES NEED WORK 
BUT I CAN'T ARGUE 
DAVE AND ANDREA I'VE GOT A FUNNY FEELING I'M ABOUT TO ROCK YOUR WORLD 
I'M NOT SURE IF IN A GOOD WAY OR A BAD WAY 
BECAUSE PROPERTY NUMBER THREE IS MY CHOICE AND YES IT'S THE WILD CARD 
NOW IT'S WILD BECAUSE LET'S RECAP HERE YOU SAID YOU WANTED A HOUSE 
I'M OFFERING YOU 
DO YOU GET ALL THAT NO AN APARTMENT RIGHT ALL 
HOW MANY FLOORS JUST THE TWO TOP 
BUT YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAID YOU WANTED THREE BEDROOMS 
YEAH I'M GIVING YOU TWO 
BUT WHAT I AM DELIVERING YOU IS THIS PROPERTY IS IN MOSELEY ONE OF THE BEST AREAS IN BIRMINGHAM 
THIS IS GREAT FOR RENTING POTENTIAL YOU CAN MAKE SOME MONEY HERE 
SO WHAT D'YOU THINK 
EH WE'D SOONER HAVE A HOUSE BUT IT'S A NICE AREA AND IT LOOKS BIG FROM THE OUTSIDE LET'S TAKE A LOOK 
ANDREA NOT COMPLETELY CONVINCED BUT I'LL GIVE IT A GO GIVE IT A GO 
WHAT YOU WILL FIND HERE IS KRISTIAN'S GOT YOU ONE OF 
THE MOST DESIRABLE POSTCODES IN SOUTH BIRMINGHAM IT'S MOSELEY 
IT'S A VERY VERY GOOD PLACE TO BUY 
ALWAYS GOOD FOR RESALE AS WELL 
THE OTHER THING IS WHEN YOU GO ROUND INSIDE YOU'LL REALISE 
AT THE MOMENT IT'S CURRENTLY BEING RENTED OUT TO MUSIC STUDENTS DAVE 
OH DEAR YEAH COME ON INSIDE HAVE A LOOK ROUND AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK O. K. 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IN MOSELEY AND SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GETTING THE WHOLE HOUSE 
OH WE'RE GOOD BUT WERE NOT THAT GOOD DOM 
LET'S JUST HOPE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE FLAT ABOUT THIS FLAT 
OH I SEE A SLIGHT MUSICAL REFERENCE DOM YOU ARE A GENIUS 
I LIKE TO THINK SO 
AH DAVE 
THEY'VE GOT A GUITAR A BIT OF AN ODD PLACE TO KEEP A GUITAR IN THE HALLWAY RIGHT BEHIND THE FRONT DOOR 
THIS DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE A VERY STUDENTY KIND OF PLACE 
YEAH I CAN SEE THE STAINS 
WHICH MIGHT MEAN IT'S NOT VERY WELL MAINTAINED 
YOU KNOW WHAT ANYBODY SELLING A PLACE THE FIRST ROOM YOU WALK INTO 
THE HALLWAY DON'T HAVE IT CLUTTERED WITH A LOAD OF JUNK 
IT'S MADNESS ISN'T IT YEAH MADNESS 
THE BATHROOM YEAH TAKE A LOOK 
CAN I HAVE A LOOK IS IT BIG 
IT'S QUITE BIG ACTUALLY YEAH THAT'S COOL 
NOW THAT BATHROOM IT'S A GOOD SIZE 
BUT IT'S NOT VERY WELL EQUIPPED 
BUT YOU GOT THE SPACE AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING 
IT'S A WHITE SUITE THOUGH AND IT LOOKS QUITE NEW IS THIS 
YOU WON'T HAVE TO CHANGE IT WHITE WILL NEVER EVER GO OUT OF FASHION 
AND THIS SEEMS TO BE THE LIVING ROOM 
AAH YOU'D LOVE IT HERE DAVE 
THERE'S AN OPEN PLAN KITCHEN CUM LOUNGE AND LOADS OF SPACE THERE 
REALLY REALLY GOOD SPACE 
THE KITCHEN LOOKS A BIT BASIC AND VERY OLD 
IT'S VERY TIRED UP THERE IT'S HAD A LOT OF SCUFFS AND DENTS AND BANGS 
IT'S TAKEN A LOT OF WEAR AND TEAR 
ERADICATE THAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK GOOD IT'S A BIT LIKE US 
YEAH IT NEEDS A FACELIFT IT DOES 
I SUPPOSE YOU'VE GOT A BIG SPACE FOR A LIVING ROOM THOUGH HAVEN'T YOU 
IT IS QUITE BIG YEAH 
HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE HE STARTS COUNTING THE GUITARS 
COMPETITION WITH THE GUITAR COLLECTION HAVEN'T I TOLD YOU 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN 
ELEVEN AND A LITTLE MANDOLIN 
I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT MANDOLIN OR A BANJO 
IT'S A BIG ROOM SINGLE GLAZED THOUGH 
I'M GLAZING OVER A SINGLE GLAZED WINDOW IS VERY VERY EASY TO REPLACE 
YOU'D HAVE TO DO A LOT WITH THE DECOR 
WHAT IS PUTTING ME OFF IS IF YOU NEVER OWNED THE LAND 
WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO 
WHAT IS HE SUDDENLY FARMER DAVE 
A LOT OF STAIRS YEAH AND QUITE STEEP STAIRS 
I KNOW THEY ARE YOUNG BUT THEY NEED STEEP STAIRS TO GET UPSTAIRS TO THE BEDROOM 
I WOULD PUT FLAT STAIRS IN THERE MYSELF 
YEAH YEAH JUST ON THE LEVEL YEAH ESCALATOR THAT WORKS 
THIS LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE BEDROOMS YEAH NICE BED 
SEE THAT'S NOT REALLY A BED THAT'S JUST A MATTRESS THAT'S A REAL SORT OF LAZY WAY AROUND IT 
THROW A MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR AND WHO GIVES A MONKEY'S 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE ISN'T IT 
IT'S LIKE THE YOUNG ONES ISN'T IT 
YOU CAN IMAGINE VYVYAN AND NEIL HEY LENTIL SOUP 
AND THAT'S A T. V. SERIES FROM QUITE SOME TIME AGO ISN'T IT 
SORRY NOT MY ERA CENTRAL HEATING PUT IN 
WOULD YOU HAVE ACCESS WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO USE IT 
IT WOULD BE SHARED ACCESS I SUPPOSE WOULDN'T IT 
ACTUALLY WHAT HE'S GOT HERE IS A COMMUNAL GARDEN ALL THE FUN ALL THE BENEFITS WITHOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY 
SECOND BEDROOM THIS IS LETTING IN A LOT MORE LIGHT 
THIS IS A LOT BIGGER THAN MOST BEDROOMS WE'VE SEEN ISN'T IT 
YEAH IT'S ACTUALLY HUGE YOU COULD HAVE ALL YOUR GUITARS IN HERE 
WOULD YOU LET ME HAVE THEM ALL IN THE BEDROOM WOULD SHE 
IT'S STRANGE THAT THEY HAVEN'T GOT ANY BEDS YOU'D HAVE 
TO DISMANTLE YOUR FURNITURE AND GET IT UP HERE 
IT'S STRANGE WE DON'T HAVE ANY BEDS YOU WOULDN'T BE HAVING THEIR FURNITURE 
YOU WOULDN'T WANT IT WOULD YOU I TELL YOU WHAT IF I WAS LOOKING TO RENT YEAH 
I'D PROBABLY WANT TO RENT IN A PLACE LIKE THIS 
YEAH IT'D BE GREAT FOR RENTING 
BUT WOULD YOU WANT TO BUY IT 
THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING 
BUT IT COULD BE AN INVESTMENT IF YOU WANTED TO RENT IT OUT 
I THINK PEOPLE WOULD SNAP IT UP BECAUSE OF THE AREA 
IT'S THE POSTCODE THEY'RE BUYING YEAH 
THEY'VE GOT THE AREA THEY WANT BUT THEY'RE GOING TO GET SLIGHTLY LESS FOR THEIR MONEY 
O. K. OH DOMINIC I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO NEED SOME MORE CONVINCING TO BE A PART OF THIS APARTMENT 
HA THAT'S AN AMAZING LIFE THIS 
ANDREA ONCE AGAIN YOU AND I HOW COME WE KEEP ENDING UP IN THE KITCHEN AREA 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET DAVE IN THE KITCHEN FOR LONG 
NO BE HONEST WITH ME RIGHT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE PLACE 
IT'S BIGGER THAN I EXPECTED SO IT SURPRISED ME 
BUT IT JUST FEELS LIKE A LOT OF WORK A LOT OF WORK 
EVERYTHING NEEDS REPLACING 
WITH YOUR BUDGET YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO TAKE ON SOMETHING THAT NEEDS SOME RENOVATION 
AND I TELL YOU WHAT RENOVATION IS REALLY GOOD FUN DO NOT BE SCARED OF IT 
NOW THIS KITCHEN IS HELL'S KITCHEN THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
IT'S JUST GREASY AND GOTTA GO 
WONKY AND RIPPED OUT FALLING APART 
THEN YOU CAN BUY A BUDGET KITCHEN THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE COMPROMISING ON QUALITY OR STYLE THESE DAYS 
THE LAY OUT HERE IS QUITE NICE 
HERE YOU'VE GOT THE SINK STRAIGHT OVERLOOKING THE GARDEN 
WHICH IS YOURS IT'S COMMUNAL SO ALL THE PLEASURES NONE OF THE HARD WORK AND HASSLE 
AND THEN THE REASON WHY I THINK THIS IS NICE FOR YOU GUYS 
IT'S A VERY CASUAL AND SOCIAL SPACE IT FLOWS BEAUTIFULLY INTO THE LOUNGE 
GET A FEW CHAIRS A FEW CHAIRS A FEW GLASSES OF WINE ETC ETC ETC 
I THINK THIS FLAT IT'S WHY I'M BACKING IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR YOU GUYS 
I'M NOT CONVINCED YOU'RE NOT CONVINCED 
IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT NEEDS TO BE DONE 
WHAT ABOUT IF I WAS TO TALK BUDGET WITH YOU 
IT MIGHT MAKE THE DIFFERENCE LET'S DO IT 
DAVE YOU'RE A FIRST TIME BUYER YEAH A BIT OF ADVICE 
TWO WAYS TO IMPROVE A PROPERTY'S VALUE IS ONE THE KITCHEN SECOND BATHROOM 
THIS ONE IS RIPE FOR IMPROVEMENT 
IT'S A VERY VERY GOOD SIZED ROOM I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I'D START 
FIRSTLY THAT CUPBOARD IT HOUSES THE HOT WATER CYLINDER 
YOU CAN MOVE THAT TO THIS CORNER 
BEAR IN MIND WHEN THAT DOOR'S OPEN YOU WOULDN'T SEE IT BUT YOU ARE LOOKING AT THAT AND IT'S UGLY YEAH 
GET RID OF ALL THAT THERE THEN YOU'VE GOT A LOVELY CORNER AREA THERE WHICH IS 
A SHOWER YEAH 
A QUADRANT SHOWER YOU COULD GET A NINE HUNDRED BY NINE HUNDRED QUADRANT SHOWER 
BUT EVERYTHING IS WHITE THE CEILING THE TILES THE SUITE 
REALLY BLAND IT NEEDS SOME COLOUR INJECTING INTO 
IT AND YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT HAVING TO RETILE THE WHOLE LOT 
YOU COULD PUT A BORDER IN YOU COULD PERHAPS PAINT THE WALLS 
THAT AREN'T TILED A NICE COLOUR PERHAPS GET A NICE FLOOR IN A GOOD LINO GOOD CARPET WHATEVER 
YOU LIKE BUT IT NEEDS A BIT OF COLOUR IN IT A BIT OF LIFE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT FOR JUST A FEW QUID YOU COULD REALLY REALLY INCREASE THE VALUE OF THIS PROPERTY 
IT SOUNDS GOOD TALKING OF MONEY YOU READY TO GUESS THE PRICE 
I'LL GIVE IT A GO LET'S GO AND JOIN THE OTHERS 
LET'S GIVE IT A GO SO IF ANDREA AND DAVE DECIDE THAT THIS FLAT IS 
FOR THEM THEY MUST REMEMBER TO BUDGET FOR AN ANNUAL SERVICE CHARGE 
AS THE CONVERSION IS TIRED CHECK THE FIRE PRECAUTION'S UP TO SCRATCH 
O. K. NO MORE DISCUSSION IT'S NOW GUESS THE PRICE TIME 
THIS IS VERY VERY CRUCIAL BECAUSE IT'S NECK AND NECK BETWEEN YOU TWO 
SO I THINK WE SHOULD LET LADIES GO FIRST 
ANDREA WHAT WOULD YOU VALUE THIS ONE THAT 
BEING IN MOSELEY PROBABLY ABOUT TOP OF THE BUDGET ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
RIGHT EVEN THOUGH IT'S LACKING THAT BEDROOM 
DON'T FORGET SHE WANTED THE WHOLE HOUSE FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE EARLIER THIS IS TRUE 
DAVE WHAT ABOUT YOU 
I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
I'LL SAY ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
THIS APARTMENT IS ACTUALLY ONLY FIFTY AWAY FROM WHAT YOU GUESSED 
IT'S ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY VERY VERY CLOSE WELL DONE 
IT DOES MAKE YOU OUR OVERALL WINNER THOUGH 
THAT IS ALL THE THREE PROPERTIES 
SO NOW WE'VE GOT TO DECIDE WHICH PROPERTY 
YOU WANT TO TEST DRIVE OR AS WE SAY TRY BEFORE YOU BUY NOW I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE GIFT A LAPTOP 
NOW THIS ISN'T A PERMANENT GIFT THIS IS JUST TO AID YOU IN MAKING YOUR DECISION BECAUSE ON THERE ARE IMAGES 
OF ALL THREE PROPERTIES ALL THE ROOMS ALL THE VIEWS 
STORED IN THERE SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THOSE AT YOUR LEISURE AND PLEASURE AND MAKE A WELL GUIDED DECISION 
O. K. SO TAKE THAT OFF AND WE'LL SEE YOU LATER ON EXCELLENT THANK YOU 
WHILE THEY STUDY THE LAPTOP 
HERE'S A QUICK RECAP FOR YOU 
SO WILL THEY GO FOR OUR JOINT CHOICE 
THE THREE BEDROOMED HOUSE WITH REAR ACCESS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF DAVE BUILDING A WORKSHOP TO PRACTISE IN 
COULD IT BE A HIT FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
I DON'T THINK SO CHRIS I'VE GOT A FEELING IT'S GOING TO BE MY CHOICE 
THE EDWARDIAN TERRACE WITH ITS LONG KITCHEN AND LARGE THIRD BEDROOM 
THEY MIGHT WANT TO ROCK WITH THE WILD CARD MY CHOICE 
O. K. IT'S A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT BUT WITH RENTAL POTENTIAL TO HELP WITH THE MORTGAGE 
THEY COULD BE QUIDS IN 
THAT'S PROPERTY ONE THEN 
NICE LIVING ROOM THE DISTANCE FROM THE ACTUAL FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
THE FRONT WINDOWS TO THE BACK DOOR IT'S VERY SMALL ISN'T IT YEAH 
THE KITCHEN IS TINY IT'S NOT EVEN A KITCHEN NO IT'S A SHOEBOX 
BASICALLY YOU ARE GETTING TWO DECENT BEDROOMS 
A GOOD LIVING ROOM BUT A VERY SMALL KITCHEN BATHROOM AND THIRD BEDROOM 
BUT YOU DO GET THE GARDEN SHALL WE LOOK AT THE NEXT ONE 
I THINK WITH THAT ONE ACTUALLY THREE BIG BEDROOMS 
YEAH IT'S A DECENT I LIKE THAT IT WAS DECEIVING FROM OUTSIDE WASN'T IT 
IT COULD BE A GREAT HOUSE BECAUSE IT'S ALL LAID OUT PERFECTLY 
THREE GOOD SIZED ROOMS BIGGER KITCHEN BUT AS AN INVESTMENT LONGER TERM 
IT'S A NICER BATHROOM AS WELL WASN'T IT 
OH YEAH IT'S LOVELY I DIDN'T LIKE THE KITCHEN 
I LIKED THAT I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THE BATHROOM GOES OFF THE KITCHEN 
I KNOW BUT IT'S STILL A NICE SIZE A NICE LAYOUT WASN'T IT OH REMEMBER THAT CARPET 
YEAH BUT CARPETS WE CAN CHANGE IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL IS IT 
NOW I WAS SURPRISED BY PROPERTY THREE YEAH LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT SHALL WE 
YEAH ACTUALLY I DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK AT A FLAT 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY SMALL AND POKY 
I LOVE THAT PROPERTY THE LAYOUT OF IT 
IT'S VERY MESSY NEEDS A LOT OF COSMETIC WORK BUT IT HAD SO MUCH CHARACTER I THINK 
THERE'S A BIG BATHROOM A LARGE OPEN PLAN KITCHEN LARGE LIVING ROOM 
I THINK WE'VE MADE OUR DECISION THEN I THINK SO YEAH YEAH SURE 
WELL ANDY DAVE YOU DIDN'T USE MY FAVOURITE NUMBER TWO 
YOU DIDN'T CHOSE KRISTIAN'S NUMBER THREE YOU CHOSE NUMBER ONE BUT IT WAS STILL A GOOD CHOICE 
BEFORE WE LET YOU IN TO DO YOUR TEST DRIVE WE'VE HAD OUR SURVEYOR GIVE THE HOUSE A ONCE OVER 
AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF POINTS WHICH HE WANTS TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION 
I FEEL IT'S MY DUTY TO STRESS HERE IT'S NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY 
AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A PROPERTY PURCHASE GET A FULL STRUCTURAL SURVEY CARRIED OUT FIRST 
BUT WE DO HAVE SOME INTERESTING BITS AND PIECES 
ANDY I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME ROUND THE BACK SO THAT LEAVES US OUT HERE 
AND WE ARE GOING TO STAND IN THE ROAD BACKING RIGHT OUT 
HOPEFULLY NOT GETTING RUN OVER HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ROOFS NOT A LOT BEING A MUSICIAN 
NO YOU RAISE THEM WITH THE MUSIC SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WELL THAT ONE MAY LOOK ALL RIGHT BUT IT'S A BIT OF AN ANTIQUE 
O. K. IT'S ACTUALLY THE ORIGINAL ROOF SO IT'S SEVENTY EIGHTY YEARS OLD AND IT'S STARTING TO SHOW SIGNS OF ITS AGE 
SO THE TILES ARE STARTING WHAT THEY CALL SHALING ALMOST LIKE DANDRUFF FOR TILES 
AND YOU GO INSIDE AND YOU'LL NOTICE THERE'S NO SARKING FELT WHICH IS ALL TECHNICAL STUFF 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET A MORTGAGE THERE'LL PROBABLY BE A RETENTION ON THAT OF FOUR THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND 
SO YOU NEED TO REPLACE THE ROOF HAVE YOU EVER DONE THAT NOT PERSONALLY 
NO OF COURSE YOU HAVEN'T SO THE COSTS INVOLVED QUITE A BIG JOB 
SCAFFOLDING TILES OFF FELTING IT'S GOING TO COST YOU ABOUT FIVE GRAND 
A LOT OF MONEY BUT WORTH IT BECAUSE ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT 
YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT FOR ANOTHER THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW 
I KNOW IT MAY SEEM LIKE BAD NEWS BUT IT CAN BE SORTED 
SO YOU DO YOUR TEST DRIVE TREAT THE PROPERTY LIKE YOUR VERY OWN WEMBLEY ARENA 
AND WE'LL HOOK UP LATER ON AND SEE HOW YOU GET ON O. K. FAIR ENOUGH SOUNDS GOOD GOOD STUFF 
THIS IS THE AREA OF CONCERN YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THE PATIO DOORS YOUR FLOOR IN THERE YEAH 
THAT'S WOODEN THAT'S LAID ON WOODEN JOISTS 
NOW WHENEVER YOU'VE GOT ANYTHING WOODEN YOU NEED TO ALLOW THE AIR TO CIRCULATE UNDERNEATH IT 
OTHERWISE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE WOOD WILL SWEAT WHICH COULD CAUSE ROTTING 
YOU DON'T WANT THAT WOOD ROTS YOU FALL THROUGH 
SO WHAT PEOPLE DO IS THEY PUT AIR BRICKS IN 
NOW OVER THE YEARS SOMEONE'S BUILT UP THIS PATIO HERE 
THERE'S PROBABLY A GOOD TWELVE INCHES OFF THE GROUND THERE 
WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS THEY'VE COVERED UP THE MAJORITY OF THIS AIRBRICK IT'S NINE INCHES THICK 
SO IT'S NOT GETTING ADEQUATE VENTILATION IT'S A DEAD EASY THING TO RECTIFY THOUGH 
BASICALLY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS YOU NEED TO HAVE THIS SECTION CUT OUT 
AND MAKE SURE THAT THE AIR BRICK HAS FREE FLOWING AIR GOING TOWARDS IT 
ONCE YOU GET THAT DONE YOU NEED TO PUT A GRATE OVER IT 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT IT BLOCKING UP WITH LEAVES AND SLUGS AND INSECTS GETTING INTO IT 
IF YOU LOOK OVER THERE SEE WHERE THE DRAIN IS 
THAT'S BEEN BUILT ROUND THE AIR BRICK WHICH IS IDEAL 
THAT'S ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE EXCELLENT 
SIMPLE SOLUTION NOT A BIG PROBLEM 
GREAT TEST DRIVE TIME COME ON 
SO MUMS DADS AND FRIENDS TURN UP FOR A NOSE AROUND THE HOUSE 
BUT IT'S ANDREA AND DAVE WHO'RE IN THE KITCHEN MAKING A CUPPA FOR THEIR PARENTS 
MINE'S WHITE NO SUGAR PLEASE 
NOW WHILE ANDREA DISAPPEARS WITH HER MUMS DAVE GETS HIS GUITAR OUT AND PLAYS A FEW TUNES 
LEAVING DAVE TO HIS KARAOKE THE MUMS WHIZ AROUND UPSTAIRS AND ENJOY A NON STOP TOUR OF THE HOUSE 
NOW IT'S TIME TO JOIN THE OTHERS AND GET THE PARTY STARTED WITH A BIT OF BUBBLY OR IN DAVE'S CASE BEER 
I SEE IT'S A HOUSEHOLD FULL NOW IS IT A PARTY 
A FAMILY AFFAIR O. K. LET'S DIVE IN AND ASK SOME QUESTIONS 
RIGHT YOU TWO WE LEFT YOU HERE IT'S VERY TIDY NOT VERY ROCK'N'ROLL ARE YOU 
RIGHT O. K. YOU'VE SPENT SOME TIME IN THE HOUSE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT 
WE'VE ENJOYED IT IT'S A BIT SMALLER THAN WE HOPED FOR 
BUT I THINK WE'VE TRIED TO BE REALISTIC WITH OUR BUDGET 
WHAT DO YOU THINK DAVE IT'S BEEN NICE TO SPEND A BIT OF TIME HERE 
AND GET A FEW OTHER OPINIONS OF PEOPLE WE KNOW QUITE WELL O. K. I'M GOING TO CUT TO THE CHASE 
HAVE CHRISTIAN AND I FOUND YOU YOUR FIRST HOME 
ARE YOU GOING TO BARTER OR ARE YOU GOING TO SCARPER 
I THINK WE SHOULD PUT MAYBE AN OFFER IN NOT THE ASKING PRICE 
YOU'RE A MAN SINGING OFF THE SAME HYMN SHEET AS ME SHAVE A BIT OFF 
GOT TO BE DONE THIS COULD BE THE ONE YEAH I THINK SO 
FANTASTIC ANDREA DIDN'T EVEN SPEAK SHE'S ALL BEAMING WITH SMILES ALL TEETH WITH HER 
MAKE A PROMISE IF YOU DO END UP BUYING THIS PROPERTY 
THEN KEEP IN TOUCH AND LET US KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS TAKE CARE GUYS BYE BYE SEE YOU 
JUST THINK CHRIS AT THE START OF THE DAY I WAS READY TO THROW THE TOWEL IN 
AND IF WE'D DONE THAT WE WOULD HAVE DISAPPOINTED THEM BITTERLY YEAH 
NOW WE FOUND A YOUNG COUPLE THEIR FIRST EVER HOME THEY WILL REMEMBER US UNTIL THE DAY THEY DIE 
I AM FEELING WARM AND SQUIDGY INSIDE ARE YOU YEAH IT'S GOOD ISN'T IT 
IF ANYBODY ELSE WOULD LIKE OUR HELP IN TRYING TO FIND THEIR DREAM PROPERTY 
THEN GET IN TOUCH AND MAYBE NEXT TIME DOMINIC AND I COULD BE FINDING YOUR DREAM HOME 
WILL THE OUTTAKES GO IN I THINK SO 
SO YOU'VE FINALLY DECIDED TO THROW AWAY THE RENT BOOKS 
AND TAKE THAT LEAP 
WASN'T COMING OUT RIGHT WAS IT NO NO 
DON'T FOCUS ON THE DECKER DECKER 
CAROL DECKER OH I'LL JUST PICK THAT ONE UP AGAIN
