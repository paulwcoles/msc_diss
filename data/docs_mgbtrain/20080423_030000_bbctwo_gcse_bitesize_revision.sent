HELLO AND WELCOME TO GCSE BITESIZE 
THIS PROGRAMME WILL GIVE YOU LOADS OF HELP 
NO MATTER WHAT TOPICS YOU'VE STUDIED IN HISTORY 
BECAUSE IT FOCUSES ON THE SKILLS NEEDED FOR ALL HISTORY SYLLABUSES 
EVALUATION AND ESSAY WRITING 
THE OTHER PROGRAMMES ON HISTORY ARE 
THE BEST WAY TO STUDY WITH BITESIZE IS TO 
WORK THROUGH THE VIDEO IN CHUNKS 
DON'T WORRY IF THE TOPICS COVERED HERE AREN'T THOSE IN YOUR COURSE 
YOU'LL STILL GET LOTS OF HELP WITH HOW TO THINK 
AND WRITE YOUR ANSWERS 
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL EXAM BOARDS 
ALL HISTORY EXAMS HAVE TWO PAPERS 
THE PROGRAMME'S ALSO BEEN DIVIDED UP INTO TWO PARTS TO REFLECT THIS 
EACH PART'S THEN BEEN BROKEN DOWN INTO MANAGEABLE SECTIONS 
LET'S LOOK AT THE FIRST PART 
THE HIGHER THE LEVEL THE MORE MARKS YOU'LL GET 
LEVEL TWO YOU'VE MADE INFERENCES FROM THE SOURCES 
OR SPOTTED SOME WEAKNESSES 
TRY TO KEEP THINKING ABOUT THESE THREE ASPECTS 
WHILE YOU'RE USING THIS PROGRAMME 
PART ONE SOURCE EVALUATION IS DIVIDED INTO FIVE SECTIONS 
YOU'LL BE EXPECTED TO LOOK AT SOURCE MATERIAL 
AND DESCRIBE WHAT IT SHOWS YOU 
IN THE EXAM YOU'LL BE GIVEN MATERIAL FROM MANY SOURCES 
MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN COVERED IN THE PROGRAMME 
BUT MAKE SURE YOU'RE PREPARED TO HAVE A GO AT ALL TYPES OF EVIDENCE 
AS YOU WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP 
MAKE NOTES OF THE CONDITIONS THE SOLDIERS HAD TO DEAL WITH 
VERDUN MARKED A FURTHER STAGE 
IN THE DEHUMANISATION OF THE SOLDIERS IN THE WAR 
AFTER TEN MONTHS AND SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRENCH AND GERMAN CASUALTIES 
THE FRONT LINE WAS ALMOST EXACTLY WHERE IT HAD BEEN AT THE START 
AND VERDUN WAS A REEKING QUAGMIRE LITTERED WITH HUMAN REMAINS 
AT VERDUN AT THE SOMME AND IN FLANDERS 
THE COMBINATION OF SLAUGHTER 
HUMAN DESPAIR AND MUD BECAME THE PIVOTAL EXPERIENCE OF THE WAR 
THE WHOLE AREA WAS MUD POCK MARKED WITH SHELL HOLES 
THERE WASN'T A PIECE OF GROUND THAT WAS VIRGIN 
JUST A WASTELAND 
AS FAR AS YOU COULD SEE 
THAT WAS THE WORST 
THERE WAS NOTHING TO COMPARE IT WITH AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED 
MANY MEN CAUGHT IN THE BARBARITIES OF INDUSTRIALISED WARFARE 
WERE BETTER EDUCATED THAN ANY SOLDIERS BEFORE THEM 
THOUGH THEY WERE MORE INFORMED 
THEY WERE IN NO BETTER POSITION TO QUESTION THE ORDERS THEY WERE GIVEN 
THE PENALTIES FOR REFUSING TO FIGHT OR FOR DESERTING 
WERE HARSH 
IN THE BRITISH ARMY 
THEY WERE APPLIED TO MEN WHO WERE VISIBLY REELING FROM SHELL SHOCK 
ANYONE WHO DISOBEYED ORDERS FACED COURT MARTIAL 
P. T. E. ARTHUR EARP WAS IN A DUGOUT WHEN HE SHOULD'VE BEEN ATTACKING 
LIKE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED OTHERS HE WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH 
ON HIS APPEAL PAPERS GENERAL HAIG WROTE 
HOW CAN WE EVER WIN IF THIS PLEA IS ALLOWED 
PAUSE THE TAPE AND WRITE DOWN 
EVERYTHING THE FILM SHOWED ABOUT THIS PART OF THE WESTERN FRONT 
YOU PROBABLY NOTED 
DID YOU SPOT THE DEAD HORSE 
THIS ISN'T A MEMORY GAME 
FILM IS USED AS A VISUAL SOURCE OF CONDITIONS AT THE FRONT 
LOOK AT THE LIST THAT YOU MADE 
THIS WERE YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
CAN YOU DO BETTER 
GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE FILM AGAIN 
AND NOTE DOWN EXTRA THINGS YOU SEE 
KEEP REFERRING TO THE QUESTION AS YOU WATCH THE CLIP 
IT WILL HELP YOU FOCUS ON WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO 
NOW YOU'LL HAVE A BETTER LIST OF ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN SEE 
BUT THIS ISN'T ENOUGH FOR TOP LEVEL ANSWERS IN COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS 
WHAT THINGS CAN YOU TELL ABOUT THE WAR FROM WHICH YOU CAN'T SEE 
PAUSE THE TAPE AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN INFER FROM THE CLIP YOU'VE SEEN 
IF YOU NEED TO REPLAY THE CLIP DO 
HERE ARE SUGGESTIONS OF WHAT YOU COULD INFER FROM THE CLIP 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS 
NOW WE MOVE ON 
IN THE LAST SECTION WE LOOKED AT A HISTORICAL SOURCE 
AS IF WE'D NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE AND KNEW NOTHING ABOUT WWI 
HISTORIANS NEVER WORK LIKE THAT 
YOU DON'T THINK LIKE THAT 
IF WWI IS PART OF THE SYLLABUS YOUR SCHOOL'S DOING 
THEN YOU'LL HAVE STUDIED IT AND KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
AS WITH ANY TOPIC YOU'VE COVERED 
IN THE EXAM PAPER WILL BE QUESTIONS ASKING YOU TO LOOK AT A SOURCE 
AND USE WHAT YOU KNOW AS WELL AS WHAT YOU SEE TO ANSWER 
THERE ARE MORE MARKS FOR THIS KIND OF QUESTION 
AND THEREFORE IT'S WORTH SPENDING MORE TIME ON THIS 
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE TYPE OF QUESTION YOU MIGHT GET 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP THEN PAUSE THE TAPE 
AND MAKE NOTES ON HOW YOU MIGHT ANSWER THE QUESTION 
THE BRITISH MINISTER OF WAR EARL KITCHENER 
BELIEVED THE WAR WOULD LAST AT LEAST THREE YEARS 
AND THAT THE MILLION MEN IN THE BRITISH ARMY WOULDN'T LAST LONG 
THREE DAYS AFTER WAR WAS DECLARED 
KITCHENER MADE A PUBLIC APPEAL FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS 
THERE WAS A MASSIVE CAMPAIGN TO GET YOUNG MEN TO JOIN UP 
THE YORKSHIRE POST REPORTED HOW A SOCCER MATCH 
TURNED INTO A RECRUITING DRIVE 
STIRRING SCENES WERE WITNESSED 
AT LEEDS CITY FOOTBALL CLUB LAST NIGHT AT THE END OF THE MATCH 
THE LORD MAYOR ADDRESSED THE CROWD OF ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND SPECTATORS 
THERE WAS A SPIRITED RUSH ACROSS THE FIELD AND ROUSING CHEERS 
UP THE STEPS STURDY YOUNG FELLAS CAME TO RECEIVE AN ARMLET OF RIBBON 
WITH THE NATIONAL COLOURS 
WHEN THE RUSH SUBSIDED 
IT WAS FOUND THAT THE NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE 
THE LADY MAYORESS CALLED FOR A FURTHER FIFTY ONE 
ANOTHER DASH WAS MADE ANOTHER ROUND OF PROLONGED CHEERING 
AND TO THE CHORUS OF IT'S A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY 
THE QUOTA WAS QUICKLY FILLED 
IT'S A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY 
IT'S A LONG WAY TO GO 
IT'S A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY 
TO THE SWEETEST GIRL I KNOW 
GOODBYE PICCADILLY FAREWELL LEICESTER SQUARA 
JOIN UP WITH YOUR PALS WAS THE SLOGAN 
CHARLIE TAYLOR AND HIS FRIENDS WENT TO SIGN UP 
THEY ASKED MY HEIGHT I TOLD THEM THEY HUMMED AND HAWED ABOUT IT 
I'M FIVE F. T. SIX SO I FILLED MY SHOES WITH PAPERS 
I SAYS THERE'S MY PALS JOINING 
SIX OF US ALL FOOTBALLERS 
THEY SAYS LET HIM GO IN 
SO I WAS ONE OF THE MIDGETS 
THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IF YOU SIGNED UP WITH YOUR PALS YOU'D BE KEPT TOGETHER 
TOWNS AND VILLAGES WOULD COMPETE TO RAISE THE MOST BATTALIONS 
WHOLE STREETS AND FACTORIES WOULD SIGN UP TOGETHER 
AS THE WAR WENT ON MANY WOULD DIE TOGETHER 
WHERE WOULD YOU START WHEN ANSWERING A QUESTION LIKE THIS 
REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE TWO THINGS TO DO 
TO GET THE HIGHEST MARKS 
PAUSE HERE TO ANSWER 
YOU CAN STOP THE TAPE AND REPLAY THE CLIPS AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT 
IN ORDER TO GET EVERYTHING DOWN 
HERE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU MIGHT'VE NOTED DOWN 
HERE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE CLIP 
BRITAIN UNLIKE OTHER COMBATANTS HAD A VOLUNTARY ARMY UNTIL NINETEEN SIXTEEN 
HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE TYPE OF QUESTION 
YOU'LL FIND IN THIS SECTION OF THE EXAM PAPER 
KEEP THE QUESTION IN MIND WHEN YOU VIEW THIS SOURCE MATERIAL 
ON APRIL TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN BRITISH FRENCH AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND TROOPS 
BEGAN LANDING ON THE TURKISH PENINSULA OF GALLIPOLI 
THEIR AIM WAS TO KNOCK GERMANY'S ALLY TURKEY OUT OF THE WAR 
IT WAS AN ENORMOUS INVASION FORCE 
AND BY MID AFTERNOON ON THE FIRST DAY THERE WERE EIGHT THOUSAND ALLIED SOLDIERS 
ON THE BEACHES 
THE TURKISH FORCE WAS HEAVILY OUTNUMBERED 
BUT THE TURKISH SOLDIERS STOOD THEIR GROUND 
THEIR BRAVERY ALLOWED TIME FOR REINFORCEMENTS TO ARRIVE 
HERE AS IN FRANCE THE ALLIED FORCES FOUND THEMSELVES INVOLVED 
IN A WAR OF TRENCHES AND STALEMATE 
CYRIL LAWRENCE WAS AN ANZAC THE AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND SOLDIERS 
HE WAS AT GALLIPOLI IN THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER 
WHEN THERE WAS A PLAGUE OF FLIES AND DISEASE 
AND BEGAN TO QUESTION THE BRITISH COMMANDERS 
DAILY NOW THE MEN ARE GETTING WEAKER 
IF ONLY THOSE AT HOME FED ON LIES AS THEY ARE 
COULD SEE HOW THE MEN REALLY ARE 
WEAK AS KITTENS 
ONE MASS OF SORES AND YET AS UNDAUNTED IN SPIRIT AS EVER 
BUT THAT SPIRIT CAN'T LAST FOREVER 
AND SOON THESE ENGLISH IDIOTS 
WILL HAVE RUINED ONE OF THE FINEST BODIES OF MEN THAT EVER FOUGHT 
IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE GALLIPOLI CAMPAIGN 
WAS A WASTE OF OFFICERS AND MEN 
IN JANUARY NINETEEN SIXTEEN WITH MILLION MEN KILLED WOUNDED OR MISSING 
THE ALLIES WITHDREW 
AT GALLIPOLI TURKS HAD FOUGHT AUSTRALIANS NEW ZEALANDERS 
AND BRITONS 
WHAT HAD STARTED AS A EUROPEAN WAR WAS NOW SOMETHING BIGGER 
A WORLD WAR 
SO MANY MEN WERE NEEDED FOR THE WAR 
THAT ENGLAND AND FRANCE HAD TO RECRUIT FROM THEIR COLONIES 
IN AFRICA NEWSPAPERS CALLED IN PEOPLE TO JOIN UP 
THE PRESENT WAR IS A WORLD WAR 
WITHOUT YOU YOUR WHITE COMRADES CANNOT DO ANYTHING 
EVERYONE WHO LOVES HIS COUNTRY AND RESPECTS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 
JOIN THIS WAR WITHOUT HESITATION 
A WEST AFRICAN CANDE CAMARA VOLUNTEERED FOR THE FRENCH ARMY 
AND WAS SENT TO FIGHT IN FRANCE 
THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF NATIONALITIES 
THERE WERE FULAS KORANKO 
URHOBOS MUMUYES 
SENUFOS MENDE 
FANGS SESERE AND A LOT MORE 
HERE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU MAY HAVE PUT IN YOUR ANSWER 
YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW THAT 
HERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF POSSIBLE ANSWERS 
EACH ANSWER WOULD BE HEADING FOR A DIFFERENT GRADE 
IF YOU GIVE THIS KIND OF ANSWER YOU'LL BE HEADING FOR A GRADE F. 
IF YOU ANSWER IN A SIMILAR WAY TO THIS STUDENT 
YOU'LL BE HEADING FOR A GRADE C. 
IF YOU ANSWERED IN A SIMILAR WAY TO THIS STUDENT 
YOU'LL BE HEADING FOR AN A GRADE 
IT'S IMPORTANT YOU UNDERSTAND 
WHY THESE THREE ANSWERS WERE HEADING FOR SUCH DIFFERENT GRADES 
THIS IS THE END OF THE SECTION ON COMPREHENSION IN CONTEXT 
LET'S MOVE ON 
THESE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD ASK YOURSELF 
HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE QUESTION 
AS YOU WATCH THE NEXT CLIP THINK ABOUT HOW YOU'D ANSWER THIS 
THEN PAUSE THE TAPE AND MAKE SOME NOTES 
I SAW ONE OF OUR BATTALION LADS 
LAID OUT ON THE GROUND 
ON TOP OF THE PARAPET 
WITH HIS LEGS UP IN THE AIR 
AND I SAID WHAT ARE YOU TRYING ON 
HE SAID I'M TRYING TO GET A WOUND IF I CAN IN MY LEG 
THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF MACHINE GUNNING GOING ON 
I THOUGHT I MIGHT GET A BULLET THROUGH MY LEG 
AND GET HOME TO BLIGHTY HOME TO ENGLAND 
HE SAID I CAN'T STAND ANY MORE I'M ABSOLUTELY AT THE FAR END 
I SAID WE'RE ALL FEELING LIKE THAT HE SAYS YOU DON'T 
I SAYS WE DO EVERY ONE OF US BUT WE'VE GOT A JOB TO DO 
HOW DID YOU GET ON 
LET'S LOOK AT THE QUESTION 
TO ANSWER THIS THINK ABOUT THE WORDS OF WALTER HARE 
IT MAY HELP YOU TO MAKE TWO LISTS 
THE FIRST ONE SHOULD SHOW YOU THE USES OF THIS SOURCE 
AND THE SECOND THE PROBLEMS OF USING THIS SOURCE 
PAUSE HERE TO ANSWER 
AND THEN CONTINUE TO HEAR SOME SUGGESTED ANSWERS 
DON'T WRITE WALTER HARE OFF BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS YOU'VE IDENTIFIED 
FOR GOOD GRADES EXAMINERS WANT TO SEE BALANCED ANSWERS 
HERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT ATTEMPTS AT ANSWERING THIS QUESTION 
EACH SCORING VERY DIFFERENT MARKS 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THESE THREE ATTEMPT 
WERE HEADING FOR SUCH DIFFERENT GRADES 
LET'S TAKE A REALLY BIASED SOURCE 
AS YOU WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP THINK ABOUT THIS QUESTION 
AS PART OF THE PROPAGANDA FOR COLLECTIVISATION EISENSTEIN MADE HIS FILM THE OLD AND THE NEW 
THE TOIL OF THE INDIVIDUAL PEASANT PULLING HIS OWN OLD PLOUGH 
WAS TO BE TRANSFORMED BY THE NEW TRACTORS OF THE COLLECTIVE FARM 
BUT THE PEASANTS REACTION IN THE UKRAINE WASN'T JUBILATION 
THERE WAS SULLEN RESISTANCE TO THE COLLECTIVE PLANS 
THE PEASANTS WERE SUSPICIOUS THEY SAW THE TRACTORS FROM MOSCOW 
AS OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE RUSSIANS MEDDLING IN UKRAINIAN AFFAIRS 
THIS CLIP IS CLEARLY BIASED A PROPAGANDA FILM 
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHY REWIND THE TAPE AND HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT 
IF YOU COULDN'T TELL THIS FILM IS BIASED FROM THE STYLE OF THE FILM 
YOU COULD TELL IT FROM THE ATTRIBUTION 
YOUR LIST OF THINGS SEEN IN THE FILM SHOULD INCLUDE 
THE STATE GRAIN REQUISITIONS LED TO AN ARTIFICIAL FAMINE IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE 
SO THE FILM WAS MISLEADING BUT DON'T WRITE IT OFF 
IT'S TEMPTING TO SAY IT'S COMPLETELY USELESS 
BUT A PROPAGANDA FILM LIKE THIS IS EXTREMELY USEFUL 
WHY MIGHT SUCH A FILM HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
WHAT CAN THAT TELL US ABOUT COLLECTIVISATION 
ANOTHER SOURCE EXAMINERS LOVE TO USE IS CARTOONS 
REMEMBER THAT THE CARTOONIST HAS SPENT HOURS ON THIS 
THINKING UP THE IDEA DRAWING THE PICTURES KEEPING IT SIMPLE 
BUT INCLUDING DETAILS SO THAT HIS AUDIENCE WILL UNDERSTAND 
EXACTLY WHO OR WHAT IS BEING SHOWN 
SO DON'T MISS ANYTHING 
THEY HAVE THE COUNTRIES THAT THEY REPRESENT WRITTEN ON THEIR HATS 
EVEN IF THEY DON'T THE MAN IS CLEARLY A SAUSAGE EATING GERMAN 
AND THE LITTLE BOY IS BELGIUM 
THE BIG MAN WANTS TO GET THROUGH THE GATE LABELLED NO THOROUGHFARE 
AND THE BOY IS TRYING TO STOP HIM 
THIS REFERS TO EVENTS IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN WHEN THE GERMAN ARMY INVADED BELGIUM 
ON ITS WAY TO TRY TO CONQUER FRANCE AS PART OF THE SCHLIEFFEN PLAN 
REMEMBER THESE CARTOONS AREN'T MEANT TO BE FUNNY 
BUT ARE POPULAR WITH EXAMINERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE COMPLEX DETAIL 
PAUSE THE TAPE HERE TO ANSWER 
THE TIME IN QUESTION IS GIVEN WITH THE CARTOON 
IT SHOWS IN THE CAPTION AND THE ACTION IN THE CARTOON 
THAT BRITAIN SUPPORTED BELGIUM 
IN FACT IT WAS THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY NINE TREATY OF NEUTRALITY WITH BELGIUM 
WHICH LED BRITAIN TO DECLARE WAR ON GERMANY 
THE CARTOON SHOWS HOW THE CARTOONIST SAW THE START OF THE WAR 
AND EXPLAINS BRITISH REACTIONS TO THIS 
IT'S USEFUL TO LEARN THE CHARACTERS 
THAT CARTOONISTS USED TO SYMBOLISE CERTAIN COUNTRIES 
JOHN BULL FOR BRITAIN 
UNCLE SAM FOR THE U. S. A. THE BEAR FOR RUSSIA 
VISUALISE THESE CHARACTERS 
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A COMPLETELY BIASED USELESS SOURCE 
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WHAT YOU CAN GET OUT OF THE SOURCE 
IN SOURCE QUESTIONS SQUEEZE THE EVIDENCE FOR MEANING 
IN TEXT SOURCES LOOK AT EVERY PHRASE EVERY SENTENCE 
TO GET WHAT YOU CAN OUT OF IT 
WITH PHOTOGRAPH SOURCES DON'T JUST BE CONTENT WITH FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
AND WITH CARTOONS THE CARTOONIST HAS TRIED TO INCLUDE 
EVERYTHING THAT'S SIGNIFICANT 
SEE IF YOU CAN PICK UP EVERY POINT THAT THE CARTOONIST MAKES SQUEEZE THE EVIDENCE 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON USEFULNESS OF SOURCES 
LET'S MOVE ON 
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE TYPE OF QUESTION YOU'LL GET 
SOURCE A IS A CLIP FROM THE GREAT WAR 
SOURCE B. IS AN AUDIO OF MALCOLM KENNEDY AN EYE WITNESS 
SOURCE C. IS SOME MODERN FOOTAGE OF THE REMAINS OF THE TRENCHES 
DON'T FORGET TO READ THE QUESTION CAREFULLY 
EVERYONE NOW REALISED THAT THIS WAS A NEW KIND OF WAR 
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM MACHINE GUN AND ARTILLERY FIRE 
SOLDIERS ON BOTH SIDES DUG TRENCHES 
AS EACH SIDE TRIED TO OUTMANOEUVRE THE OTHER 
THE TRENCHES SPREAD UNTIL THE WESTERN FRONT RAN FOR FOUR HUNDRED MILES 
FROM THE CHANNEL TO SWITZERLAND 
BY LATE NINETEEN FOURTEEN THE GERMAN ARMY COULD GO NO FURTHER 
AND THE BRITISH AND FRENCH COULDN'T PUSH THEM BACK 
THIS WAS STALEMATE 
THE TROOPS WERE FORCED TO REMAIN IN THE TRENCHES 
TO DEFEND THEIR POSITIONS 
LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE TRENCHES WERE APPALLING 
SOME MEN THOUGHT THIS WAS LIKE BEING BURIED ALIVE 
TO STOP THEMSELVES FROM GOING MAD 
THEY SANG SONGS PLAYED CARDS AND WROTE LETTERS HOME 
AND SO IT DRAGGED ON 
THE WAR WASN'T OVER BY CHRISTMAS 
CAPTAIN MALCOLM KENNEDY WAS WITH THE SCOTTISH RIFLES 
THE CONSTANT IMMERSION IN ICY COLD WATER PLAYED HAVOC WITH THE FEET 
AND MADE THEM SWELL SO MUCH 
THAT AT TIMES IT WAS AGONY TO KEEP ONE'S BOOTS ON 
TO TAKE THEM OFF HOWEVER WOULD'VE BEEN FATAL 
AS IT WOULD'VE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO PULL THEM ON AGAIN 
RAIN SNOW SLEET 
WIND MUD ALL ADDED THEIR BIT TO THE MISERY OF TRENCH LIFE 
THE TERRIBLE MONOTONY OF THE DAILY AND NIGHTLY ROUTINE 
MANUAL LABOUR AND SENTRY DUTY NIGHT AND DAY 
WITH INSUFFICIENT SLEEP 
NEVER WARM NEVER DRY 
DOG TIRED 
AND WEARY IN BODY AND MIND 
IT WAS THE START OF A LONG DEADLOCK 
IN THIS HALF BURIED WAR 
DEFENDING A POSITION WAS MUCH EASIER THAN TAKING THE ENEMY'S 
MEN KEPT BELOW THE PARAPET 
BUT BOTH SIDES WATCHED THE OTHER CONSTANTLY 
AND SNIPERS PEERED THROUGH THEIR STEEL SPY HOLES 
TO SHOOT ANYTHING THAT MOVED 
THE GERMANS BELIEVED 
THAT ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS STAY PUT ON THE TERRITORY THEY'D TAKEN 
THEY DUG ELABORATE BUNKERS 
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE SHELLING AND WAITED 
CUT BY HAND OR WITH POWER DRILLS 
THEIR HUMAN BURROWS COULD GO DOWN FIFTY METRES WITH SEVERAL LEVELS 
THERE WERE UNDERGROUND KITCHENS SLEEPING QUARTERS AND SICK BAYS 
SOME HAD ELECTRICITY AND WATER 
ALLIED SOLDIERS ADMIRED THE GERMANS' THOROUGHNESS 
HERE'S A REMINDER OF THE QUESTION 
DON'T FALL INTO THE TRAP OF ANSWERING THE WRONG QUESTIONS 
PAUSE THE TAPE AND HAVE A GO AT ANSWERING THE QUESTION 
HERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS OF THINGS YOU COULD'VE PUT IN YOUR LISTS 
YES IT DOES 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON SOURCE COMPARISON 
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE FINAL SECTION 
PEOPLE NOT JUST HISTORIANS HAVE THEIR OWN VIEWS ABOUT THE PAST 
ONE OF THE THINGS HISTORIANS DO 
IS COMMENT ON HOW TRUTHFUL OR ACCURATE THESE VIEWS ARE 
YOU'RE ASKED TO DO THE SAME THING IN THIS PART OF THE EXAM 
THIS TYPE OF QUESTION USUALLY COMES AT THE END OF THE PAPER 
HERE WE'RE GOING TO USE 
A DESCRIPTION OF THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES AND HOW IT WAS MADE 
THEN ADD ANY COMMENTS 
FROM YOUR OWN KNOWLEDGE 
THIS QUESTION USUALLY COUNTS FOR QUITE A LOT OF MARKS 
WATCH THE CLIP AND THEN HAVE A GO AT THE QUESTION 
IN DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
WOODROW WILSON SET OFF FOR THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE 
GERMANY LOOKED TO THE PRESIDENT TO NEGOTIATE A FAIR PEACE FOR THEM 
BASED ON HIS FOURTEEN POINTS 
WILSON THOUGHT THIS WAS HIS CHANCE TO REMAKE THE WORLD 
IN HIS FOURTEEN POINTS IT SAID 
THAT ALL PEOPLES EVERYWHERE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHO RULED THEM 
HE ALSO WANTED TO SET UP A PEACE KEEPING ORGANISATION 
CALLED THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS TO PREVENT ANOTHER WORLD WAR 
WHEREVER HE WENT PEOPLE TURNED OUT TO WELCOME HIM 
IN FRANCE ITALY AND BRITAIN THOUSANDS GREETED THE PRESIDENT 
BUT THE LEADERS OF THE NATIONS WEREN'T SO PLEASED TO SEE WILSON 
BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER DAVID LLOYD GEORGE 
WAS AFRAID THAT WILSON'S PLANS WOULD END BRITAIN'S EMPIRE 
THE FRENCH PRIME MINISTER GEORGES CLEMENCEAU 
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT GERMANY COULD NEVER INVADE FRANCE AGAIN 
HE FELT THAT WILSON'S PLANS WOULDN'T WORK 
ALSO AT THE PEACE TALKS WERE LOTS OF THE SMALLER NATIONS 
THEY HOPED THAT WILSON'S FOURTEEN POINTS WOULD BRING THEM INDEPENDENCE 
DELEGATIONS FROM ACROSS THE WORLD SOUGHT THE FRIENDSHIP OF AMERICA 
THEY TOLD US THAT THEY WEREN'T SURE THAT THEY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE 
SOME OF THEM CAME FROM COUNTRIES 
THAT I HAVE TO MY SHAME NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE 
THE ALLIES' DISCUSSIONS OVER PEACE TERMS WEREN'T GOING TO BE EASY 
BUT A SOLUTION WAS NEEDED TO END THE CHAOS THROUGHOUT EUROPE 
NOWHERE MORE SO THAN IN GERMANY 
THE KAISER HAD GONE AND THE CONTINUING NAVAL BLOCKADE 
MEANT THERE WERE STILL SEVERE FOOD SHORTAGES 
DIFFERENT POLITICAL GROUPS WERE STRUGGLING FOR POWER 
PEOPLE WERE FIGHTING IN THE STREETS OF BERLIN 
GERMANY'S NEW GOVERNMENT USED EX SOLDIERS TO RESTORE ORDER 
IN JUST A FEW DAYS IN JANUARY NINETEEN NINETEEN 
OVER ONE THOUSAND WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED 
IN PARIS THE PEACE TALKS WERE NOW BEING HELD BEHIND CLOSED DOORS 
AND WILSON WAS GIVING IN ON ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER 
A YOUNG BRITISH DIPLOMAT HAROLD NICHOLSON 
WAS CALLED IN TO ADVISE THE LEADERS 
HE HAD BELIEVED IN WOODROW WILSON AND HIS FOURTEEN POINT PLAN 
HE WAS ANGRY THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS GIVING IN 
THE DOOR OPENS A GRAND ROOM WITH THE WINDOWS OPEN UPON THE GARDEN 
AND THE SOUND OF WATER FROM A FOUNTAIN 
CLEMENCEAU LLOYD GEORGE AND PRESIDENT WILSON 
HAD PULLED UP ARMCHAIRS AND CROUCH LOW OVER THE MAP 
IT'S APPALLING THAT THESE IGNORANT MEN SHOULD BE 
CUTTING PARTS OF THE WORLD TO BITS 
AS IF THEY WERE DIVIDING A CAKE 
IN THE AFTERNOON THERE IS THE FINAL REVISION OF AUSTRIA'S FRONTIERS 
HUNGARY IS DIVIDED UP LAZILY 
CARELESSLY 
AND THEN ANOTHER FRONTIER 
AND THEN TEA AND MACAROONS 
THE TREATY WAS SIGNED ON JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH NINETEEN NINETEEN 
FIVE YEARS TO THE DAY 
AFTER AUSTRIA'S ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND HAD BEEN SHOT 
THE SPOT CHOSEN FOR THE SIGNING WAS THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES IN PARIS 
THE TREATY SAID THAT GERMANY WAS GUILTY OF STARTING THE WAR 
AND SO HAD TO PAY THE FULL COST 
GERMANY WAS ALSO STRIPPED OF ALL ITS COLONIES 
AND ONLY ALLOWED TO KEEP A SMALL ARMY AND NAVY 
THE GERMANS WERE LED IN TO SIGN THE TREATY HAROLD NICHOLSON WAS THERE 
WE ENTER THE HALL OF MIRRORS 
THROUGH THE DOOR ALONE AND PATHETIC 
COME THE TWO GERMAN DELEGATES 
THE SILENCE IS TERRIFYING 
THEY KEEP THEIR EYE FIXED AWAY FROM THOSE TWO THOUSAND STARING EYES 
IT IS ALMOST PAINFUL 
THEY SIGN 
SUDDENLY FROM THE OUTSIDE COMES THE CRASH OF GUNS 
THUNDERING A SALUTE 
A TREATY HAD BEEN SIGNED 
BUT MANY BELIEVED THAT IT HAD BEEN DONE TOO QUICKLY 
AND THAT A REAL PEACE HAD NOT BEEN MADE 
THE MANY DIFFERENT DISPUTES OVER BORDERS AND TERRITORIES 
WHICH HAD CONTRIBUTED TO THE START OF THE WWI 
HAD NOT BEEN SOLVED 
GERMANY FELT HUMILIATED AND RESENTFUL THAT THEY WERE FORCED 
TO ACCEPT COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY AND PAY SUCH A HIGH PRICE 
IT IS EASY TO CRITICISE THE PEACEMAKERS 
MANY PEOPLE NOW THINK THEY WERE ATTEMPTING TO DO 
AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK IN IMPOSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES 
THE PEACE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE WORTH ALL THE LIVES THAT HAD BEEN LOST 
IT WAS NOT A LASTING PEACE 
THERE'S NO ONE RIGHT WAY TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION 
HERE ARE SOME POINTS YOU COULD'VE MADE TO DIVIDE IT INTO PARAGRAPHS 
THE NEXT FEW PARAGRAPHS COULD LOOK AT THE FACTS 
SUPPORTING THE VIEW THAT THIS WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT 
THE NEXT FEW PARAGRAPHS COULD LOOK AT THE CRITICISMS OF THE VIEW 
THAT IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT 
THAT'S THE END OF THE WHOLE OF PART ONE ON SOURCE EVALUATION 
LET'S LOOK AT THE SECOND PART OF THE PROGRAMME 
WHICH FOCUSES ON ESSAY WRITING 
THERE ARE USUALLY FOUR LEVELS 
THE HIGHER THE LEVEL THE MORE MARKS YOU'LL GET 
AND THE BETTER YOUR GRADE WILL BE 
ESSAY WRITING IS DIVIDED INTO TWO SECTIONS 
LET'S LOOK AT MAKING A PLAN 
EVEN IF NAZI GERMANY ISN'T IN YOUR HISTORY SYLLABUS 
YOU'LL FIND THE SKILLS IN THIS SECTION INVALUABLE 
IT'S A SKILL MANY FIND DIFFICULT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS 
BETWEEN AN ANSWER SCORING SEVEN OUT OF FIFTEEN LEADING TO A GRADE D. 
AND AN ANSWER WHICH USING THE SAME FACTS SCORES TEN OUT OF FIFTEEN 
AND IS HELPING TOWARDS A GRADE C. 
THE ANSWER IS THAT THE FIRST WILL BE A JUMBLE OF UNCONNECTED THOUGHTS 
AND THE SECOND WILL BE WELL PLANNED AND WELL STRUCTURED 
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE QUESTION 
IF YOU'VE DONE THIS TOPIC YOUR MIND WILL BE FULL OF THINGS TO SAY 
IT'S AN INTERESTING TOPIC WITH LOTS OF MATERIAL ON IT 
WHAT BRICKS HAVE YOU GOT IN PLANNING AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION 
HERE ARE SOME FILM CLIPS AND STILLS ABOUT THE NAZIS AND YOUNG PEOPLE 
THIS STORY TYPICAL IN NAZI GERMANY SHOWS HOW EASILY YOUNG MINDS TOOK ON DANGEROUS IDEAS 
SCHOOLS HAD BEEN NAZI FIED 
ANTI NAZI TEACHERS SACKED 
TEXTBOOKS REWRITTEN 
NAZI RACE SCIENCE WAS TAUGHT IN THE CLASSROOM 
JEWISH STUDENTS HAD SEPARATE DESKS 
THEN SEPARATE SCHOOLS 
BY FORTY TWO THEY COULD GET NO FORMAL EDUCATION AT ALL 
MEANWHILE CHILDREN LIKE HENRY WERE TAUGHT TO SPOT THE JEWISH ENEMY 
THEY TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE OF THE GERMAN BLOOD IN MY VEINS 
I WAS A SUPERIOR BEING I NEVER ASKED WHAT GERMAN BLOOD REALLY WAS 
OLD HISTORY TEXTBOOKS WERE DESTROYED THOSE THAT REPLACED THEM 
TAUGHT CHILDREN A NAZI VERSION OF GERMANY'S PAST AND FUTURE 
WE LEARNT ABOUT LEBENSRAUM LIVING SPACE 
HOW GLORIOUS IT WOULD BE TO FIGHT POLAND AND RUSSIA TO CONQUER LAND 
WE LEARNT ABOUT BATTLES AND WARS AND KINGS 
HOW IF WE STUCK TOGETHER 
AND WEREN'T STABBED IN THE BACK LIKE LAST TIME WE COULD NOT LOSE 
THE NAZIS PUT TREMENDOUS ENERGY INTO WINNING THEM OVER 
THEIRS WAS THE PARTY OF YOUTH AGAINST AGE 
OFFERING YOUNG PEOPLE NOT JUST A DREAM BUT A ROLE TO PLAY 
STANDARD BEARERS IN THE MARCH TO A NEW DAWN 
IT WAS A WAY OF CHANNELLING THE NATURAL REBELLIOUSNESS OF YOUTH ON ORGANISED LINES 
THE ORGANISATION RESPONSIBLE WAS THE HITLERJUGEND 
THE YOUTH WING OF THE NAZI PARTY 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY TWO 
THE HITLER YOUTH NUMBERED JUST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WITHIN TWO YEARS 
IT NUMBERED THIRTY FIVE MILLION 
AND BY NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
IT WAS AN ARMY COMPULSORY FOR ALL BOYS 
WITH GIRLS JOINING ITS SISTER ORGANISATION THE LEAGUE OF GERMAN MAIDENS 
IT WAS THE LARGEST YOUTH MOVEMENT THE WORLD HAD EVER SEEN 
MOST ROADS IN GERMANY AT THAT TIME HAD COBBLES 
IT WAS PAINFUL ON OUR FEET BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER 
WE FELT IMPORTANT POLICE STOPPED TRAFFIC TO GIVE US RIGHT OF WAY 
AND PASSERS BY HAD TO SALUTE TO RESPECT OUR FLAG 
I REMEMBER HOW FUNNY IT SOMETIMES WAS 
OLD LADIES WITH SHOPPING BAGS SHOOTING THEIR ARMS INTO THE AIR 
THE GROUP MET AFTER SCHOOL AND ALL DAY SATURDAY 
THERE WAS PLENTY OF SPORT 
WITH THE EMPHASIS ON TEAM WORK 
AND THERE WAS TRAINING IN USEFUL SKILLS 
SIGNALLING FIXING BIKES 
COLLECTING WASTE AND SCRAP METAL 
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON WAS IN NAZI THEORY 
LEARNING TO LOVE HITLER 
BOYS MEANWHILE WERE BEING BRED FOR WAR 
THESE SCENES RECORD LIFE ON A TYPICAL HITLER YOUTH SUMMER CAMP 
THE CAMPS WERE THE HIGH POINT OF THE HITLER YOUTH CALENDAR AND THEY WERE MUCH LOVED 
THEY GAVE POOR CHILDREN THE CHANCE OF A HOLIDAY SOMETIMES FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THEY MIXED RICH AND POOR TOGETHER THEY INTRODUCED CITY KIDS TO THE COUNTRYSIDE 
BUT THEIR MAIN FUNCTION WAS BASIC MILITARY TRAINING 
WE LEARNED HOW TO THROW HAND GRENADES HOW TO DIG TRENCHES 
THEN THEY'D TAKE US ON LONG HARD MARCHES TO TOUGHEN US UP 
IF ANYONE FELL THEY'D SHOUT TILL THEY WOBBLED ONTO THEIR FEET AGAIN 
THEY WOULD DIVIDE US INTO TWO GROUPS THE BLUES AND THE REDS 
ONE GROUP TO DEFEND A POSITION THE OTHER TO ATTACK IT 
THEY WHISTLED AND THEN CONTACT 
NOISE BLOODY NOSES TWISTED ARMS 
SHRIEKS OF PAIN 
IN THE BEGINNING I HATED IT ALL BUT I GOT USED TO IT 
AND I THINK WHAT IT DID WAS DEVELOP THE AGGRESSION WE WOULD ALL NEED TO HELP GERMANY FIGHT THE WAR 
THE IDEAL CHILD RAISED BY PROUD NAZI PARENTS WAS OF QUITE ANOTHER MOULD 
FOR ONE THING YOUNG MEN AND YOUNG WOMEN HAD DIFFERENT PARTS TO PLAY 
AS A LEADER OF THE GIRLS' LEAGUE PUT IT 
MEN AND WOMEN 
BOYS AND GIRLS 
MUST CARRY OUT THEIR DUTY ACCORDING TO THEIR STATION 
BOYS WE RAISE AS POLITICAL SOLDIERS AND GIRLS AS THE COMRADES OF THESE POLITICAL SOLDIERS 
WE TEACH THEM TO BE WIVES AND LOVERS AND TO BREED THE NEXT GENERATION THAT'S ALL 
KINDER KIRCHE KUECHE 
CHILDREN CHURCH AND KITCHEN 
GIRLS IN NAZI GERMANY WEREN'T ENCOURAGED TO HAVE AMBITIONS BEYOND THE HOME 
IN THE GIRLS' LEAGUE THEY LEARNED COOKING MAKING BEDS CHILDCARE 
THEIR CLOTHES AND HAIR COPIED OLD PEASANT STYLES 
NO CIGARETTES NO MAKE UP 
A PERM COULD BE PUNISHED BY SHAVING THE HEAD 
HOW MANY CHILDREN ESCAPED INDOCTRINATION 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW 
AS TEN YEARS OF NAZI RULE PASSED BY 
THE HITLER YOUTH LOST ITS APPEAL 
AS SOMETHING EXCITING 
IT WAS NOW COMPULSORY 
BACKED UP BY GESTAPO LAWS AND BUSY BODY HITLER YOUTH PATROLS 
MORE AND MORE THE REBELLIOUS THING WAS TO REFUSE TO JOIN 
THESE PHOTOGRAPHS ARE THE ONLY SURVIVING PICTURES OF GERMAN YOUTH GANGS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN FORTIES 
THE EDELWEISS PARIS THE TEXAS BAND THE NAVAJOS 
THEY BEAT UP NAZI OFFICIALS WROTE GRAFFITI ON WALLS BUT MOSTLY 
THEY JUST HUNG OUT AND LISTENED TO AMERICAN JAZZ 
THEIR CASUAL FUN LOVING ATTITUDE MADE A MOCKERY OF NAZI CONTROL 
THEY DANCE OUTRAGEOUSLY THEY CALL IT SWING 
SOMETIMES TWO BOYS WITH ONE GIRL SOMETIMES ALTOGETHER 
IN A WILD CIRCLE GIRLS WEAR LIPSTICK AND PAINT THEIR NAILS 
IT'S MONSTROUS 
I REMEMBER ONE TIME WHEN A GROUP OF JAZZERS HAD GATHERED ON THE PIER 
TO PLAY LOUIS ARMSTRONG AND DUKE ELLINGTON NOT DISTURBING ANYONE 
BUT JAZZ WAS UN GERMAN AND SO THE SELF IMPORTANT HITLER YOUTH LEADER 
MARCHES UP AND ORDERS THEM TO STOP THIS JEWISH NONSENSE 
BUT THE JAZZERS STRIPPED HIS CLOTHES OFF STUFFED THE MOST DISGUSTING THINGS INTO HIS MOUTH 
AND THEY CHUCKED HIM IN THE RIVER BY THIS HUGE OUTFLOW 
IT TOOK NO MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES 
THE GOVERNMENT HIT BACK 
CURFEWS WERE ORDERED TO STOP YOUNG PEOPLE VISITING BARS AFTER NINE P. M. 
HANGING AROUND AND SMOKING IN PUBLIC WERE BANNED 
FORCED LABOUR FOR THOSE THAT BROKE THE RULES 
OR DEATH 
THIS PHOTO SHOWS THE FATE OF TWELVE YOUNG EDELWEISS PIRATES CAUGHT IN COLOGNE IN FORTY FOUR 
THERE'S NO RIGHT APPROACH BUT HERE'S ONE WAY IN 
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE CLIPS AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT TO 
AS YOU MAY HAVE GATHERED 
THE ACTUAL ANSWERS TO THIS KIND OF QUESTION SHOULD BE QUITE LONG 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND 
WHY THESE THREE ATTEMPTS AT THE SAME QUESTION 
WERE HEADING FOR SUCH DIFFERENT GRADES 
PAUSE THE TAPE AND REPLAY THE THREE ANSWERS 
TO MAKE SURE YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON MAKING A PLAN ON ESSAY WRITING 
THIS IS A WHY QUESTION 
ONE OF THE COMMONEST STYLES OF ESSAY QUESTION 
IT'S ALSO WIDE RANGING COVERING THE ENTIRE INTER WAR PERIOD 
YOU MUST REMEMBER AND SELECT WHICH EVENTS AND IDEAS 
YOU'LL HAVE TO MENTION IN YOUR ANSWER 
SOME OF THESE ITEMS HAVE DATES BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN 
PUTTING THINGS IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER IS THE BEST PLAN 
FOR AN APPROACH ON HOW TO ARRANGE IT CHECK BACK TO THE QUESTION 
THE WORLD'S HOPES OF A LASTING PEACE WERE FOCUSED ON ONE MAN 
WHEN PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON ARRIVED FOR THE PEACE CONFERENCE 
TO BE HELD IN PARIS HE WAS HAILED LIKE A NEW MESSIAH 
HE HAD TAKEN AMERICA INTO THE WAR IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN 
GIVEN NEW HOPE TO THE EXHAUSTED BRITISH AND FRENCH ARMIES 
AND ENSURED AN ALLIED VICTORY 
HE DOCKED HIS HAT LEFT AND RIGHT HE WAS VERY POLITE 
EVERYONE SHOUTED LONG LIVE AMERICA 
WE KNEW THEY WERE OUR SAVIOURS 
HE WAS REALLY ACCLAIMED IN PARIS AND EVERYWHERE HE WENT 
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS ONE OF HIGH PATRIOTISM 
BECAUSE WE'D WON THE WAR 
WILSON PROMISED THE CROWDS WHO'D RECEIVED HIM SO RAPTUROUSLY A PEOPLE'S PEACE 
BY THIS HE MEANT A PEACE BASED ON HIS OWN HIGH PRINCIPLES 
A LENIENT PEACE THAT WOULD LAST AND BE FAIR TO ALL 
OTHER LEADERS LIKE BRITAIN'S LLOYD GEORGE AND FRANCE'S CLEMENCEAU 
HAD A LESS IDEALISTIC SENSE OF WHAT THEIR PEOPLE WANTED 
THEY KNEW THE POPULAR CLAMOUR FOR REVENGE ON GERMANY 
AS THEY NEGOTIATED THE SETTLEMENT TO BE SIGNED AT THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES 
WILSON SET THE AGENDA 
HE WANTED SELF DETERMINATION AND DEMOCRACY TO BE THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES 
AN ENTIRELY NEW ORGANISATION THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS 
WAS INTENDED TO BRING JUSTICE BETWEEN COUNTRIES 
IT WAS AGREED IN THE GREAT HALL OF MIRRORS 
THE NEW NATIONS HOPED TO PROTECT THEIR FRAGILE FREEDOM 
THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL BODY THAT MET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NINETEEN TWENTY 
THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS HELD ITS FIRST MEETING IN A SWISS HOTEL 
ITS SUPPORTERS SHARED AN OPTIMISTIC BELIEF 
THAT A NEW ERA OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS WAS BEGINNING 
THEY WERE UNDETERRED BY THE FACT THAT THE AMERICANS WEREN'T THERE 
CONGRESS HAD REFUSED TO JOIN 
AND THAT THE RUSSIANS AND THE GERMANS WEREN'T MEMBERS EITHER 
THEY BELIEVED THE LEAGUE COULD REPLACE THE BAD OLD WORLD OF SECRET DIPLOMACY WITH OPEN DISCUSSION 
PUBLIC OPINION WOULD ALWAYS BE LISTENED TO 
WEAK COUNTRIES WOULD HAVE A VOICE AS WELL AS THE STRONG 
POLAND'S PRIME MINISTER THE PIANIST PADEREWSKI CALLED IT THE DAWN OF A NEW ORDER 
THE LEAGUE TRIED TO BUILD UP POPULAR SUPPORT FOR ITS WORK 
JENNIFER HART CAMPAIGNED FOR THE IDEA IN BRITAIN 
MY ROLE IN THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS UNION 
WAS TO GET THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND THE IDEAS BEHIND THE LEAGUE 
FIRSTLY THAT IT WAS A TOTALLY NEW THING 
ESPECIALLY THIS CONCEPT THAT ONE WAS CONCERNED IF NATION A WAS ATTACKING NATION B. 
YOU COULDN'T JUST STAND ON THE SIDELINES 
AND TO GET PUBLIC OPINION TO BRING PRUSSIA ON GOVERNMENT TO USE THE MACHINERY OF THE LEAGUE 
ONE DIDN'T GO LOOKING FOR FAULTS OR WEAKNESSES IN THE GOVERNMENT 
SO MUCH AS SAYING IT'S A WONDERFUL NEW CONSTRUCTION 
AND IT COULD BE MADE TO WORK IF PEOPLE WANT IT TO 
A NEW WAVE OF NOVELS AND FILMS REKINDLED THE SENSE OF HORROR 
ORDINARY SOLDIERS DISCUSSED THE ABSURDITY OF WAR 
WELL HOW DO THEY START A WAR 
WELL ONE COUNTRY OFFENDS ANOTHER 
HOW COULD ONE COUNTRY OFFEND ANOTHER 
DO YOU MEAN A MOUNTAIN OVER IN GERMANY GETS MAD AT A FIELD OVER IN FRANCE 
WELL STUPID ONE PEOPLE OFFENDS ANOTHER 
OH THAT'S IT I SHOULDN'T BE HERE AT ALL I DON'T FEEL OFFENDED 
IT DON'T APPLY TO TRAMPS LIKE YOU 
GOOD THEN I CAN BE GOING HOME RIGHT AWAY YOU JUST TRY IT 
MANY SAW THE FIRST PRIORITY AS DISARMAMENT 
IF THE LEAGUE COULD ONLY GET NATIONS TO AGREE TO REDUCE THEIR WEAPONS 
THEN THE THREAT OF WAR WOULD BE REMOVED 
GERMANY WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY DISARMED IN THE EARLY NINETEEN TWENTIES AS A CONDITION OF VERSAILLES 
THOUGH BRITAIN THE U. S. AND JAPAN AGREED TO LIMIT THEIR NAVIES 
THE WORLD DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE SO MANY EXPECTED WAS CONSTANTLY POSTPONED 
THE ANTI WAR FILMS INCREASED PUBLIC IMPATIENCE FOR DISARMAMENT 
WHEN THE LEAGUE FINALLY ARRANGED THE WORLD DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE FOR NINETEEN THIRTY TWO EXPECTATIONS ROSE 
AND WE ARE GOING TO GO TO GENEVA 
TO GET THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD TO JOIN IN 
AND REDUCE THIS ENORMOUS DISGRACEFUL BURDEN OF ARMAMENTS 
WHICH WE ARE NOW BEARING FROM ONE END OF THE WORLD TO THE OTHER 
IN GENEVA THE CONFERENCE TOOK DELIVERY OF MASS PETITIONS COLLECTED FROM AROUND THE WORLD 
THE MILLIONS OF SIGNATURES WERE DESIGNED TO PUT PRESSURE ON GOVERNMENTS 
AND SHOW HOW PEOPLE EXPECTED THEM TO BANISH WAR 
I WENT TO ONE OF THE OPENING SESSIONS OF THE CONFERENCE 
WHEN PEOPLE CAME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD PETITIONING FOR DISARMAMENT 
AND IT WAS MEANT TO BE A TREMENDOUS MOMENT 
WE HAD GREAT HOPES THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE VERY SUBSTANTIAL DISARMAMENT 
L'AUSTRALIE 
CENT DOUZE MILLE CENT HUIT 
AUSTRALIA 
ONE HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHT 
THE FINAL TALLY WAS ANNOUNCED AS THE CONFERENCE BEGAN 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THREE 
AND HAWAII 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY 
THERE ARE LUNATICS IN EVERY COUNTRY 
WHO REALLY WANT THE ATTEMPT TO ORGANISE PEACE TO BE ABANDONED 
NO ONE DOUBTS THAT DISARMAMENT IS POSSIBLE 
BUT THE COMMON MAN WANTS TO KNOW 
WHETHER THE GOVERNMENTS WITH GREAT MILITARY NAVAL AND AIR FORCES 
ARE REALLY IN EARNEST IN THEIR DESIRE FOR PEACE 
IF THEY ARE 
A DISARMAMENT TREATY CAN BE FRAMED 
AND IF IT IS ACCEPTED 
THE WHOLE INTERNATIONAL ATMOSPHERE WILL CHANGE AS IF BY MAGIC 
BUT INTERNATIONAL IDEALISM 
CLASHED WITH OLD STYLE NATIONAL SELF INTEREST 
ARRIVING IN NEW YORK 
POLAND'S FORMER PRIME MINISTER PADEREWSKI EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM 
MR. PADEREWSKI WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ABOUT DISARMAMENT 
AND THE RECENT EFFORTS IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR 
THAT'S A VERY GOOD INTENTION 
IT'S A VERY FINE IDEA 
BUT A VERY DIFFICULT TASK 
EVERYONE EXPECTS THE OTHER FELLOW TO DISARM 
BUT IS NOT READY TO DISARM HIMSELF 
BUT THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS DID BEGIN TO PUT ANOTHER WILSONIAN IDEAL INTO PRACTICE 
SELF DETERMINATION 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SOME MINORITIES WERE GIVEN A CHANCE TO CHOOSE WHICH COUNTRY THEY WANTED TO BE IN 
PLEBISCITES WERE HELD IN SEVERAL REGIONS THAT HAD BEEN PART OF GERMANY 
ON THE BORDER OF DENMARK AND GERMANY PEOPLE VOTED TO BE DANISH 
BUT FOR EACH WINNER THERE WERE LOSERS 
EACH RESULT CREATED A NEW WAVE OF REFUGEES 
THOUGH THEY'D WON THEIR PLEBISCITE 
GERMAN SPEAKERS ON PART OF THE NEW POLISH GERMAN BORDER WERE DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES 
AND THE POLES TOOK THE TERRITORY ANYWAY 
TO GERMAN EYES THE POLES HAD SEIZED WHAT WAS RIGHTFULLY GERMANY 
THE SENSE THAT THEY'D BEEN ROBBED ONLY ADDED TO GERMAN GRIEVANCES 
THEY'D SEEN THEIR TERRITORY REDUCE 
THEY'D BEEN FORCED TO PAY BACK THE COST OF THE WAR IN INSTALMENTS THAT COULD LAST UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT 
AND THEIR ECONOMY WAS SOON CRIPPLED BY HYPER INFLATION 
AFTER EACH CLIP PAUSE THE TAPE AND WRITE DOWN THE KEY POINTS IT MAKES 
THEN ADD ANY INFORMATION YOU CAN REMEMBER ABOUT THE EVENT 
THE TRUST IN WHAT DEMOCRACY AND REASON MIGHT DO 
WAS INCREASINGLY SHAKEN 
THE GERMANS STILL BITTER AT THEIR TREATMENT 
BROUGHT A NEW LEADER TO POWER ADOLF HITLER 
CARL NAGEL NOW TRAINING TO BE A POLICEMAN SAW HIM IN MUNICH 
I STOOD IN THE CROWD AS HITLER DROVE PAST 
WHEN HE SALUTED US WE HAILED HIM SHOUTING 
HITLER TRIED TO REMOVE THE BURDENS 
THAT THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES HAD IMPOSED ON GERMANY 
HITLER PROMISED WORK AND BREAD FOR ALL GERMANS 
HE PROMISED TO ELIMINATE THE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT 
HE PROMISED TO MAKE GERMANY 
A NATION THAT COULD SHOW ITS FACE IN EUROPE 
THE ITALIANS ALSO DISSATISFIED WITH THE PEACE 
WERE GIVEN THE SAME ASSURANCES 
MUSSOLINI PROMISED THEM A NEW ROMAN EMPIRE 
MILLIONS OF ITALIANS REJOICED IN THE SEEMING MIRACLE OF FASCISM 
MAINTAINING THE ARDOUR AND SPIRIT OF PACIFISM 
WAS ALSO MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR IN SPAIN 
A NATIONALIST REVOLT LED BY GENERAL FRANCO AND BACKED BY HITLER AND MUSSOLINI 
RAISED FEARS THAT MORE OF EUROPE WOULD FALL TO FASCISM 
THE REBELS MADE A RUTHLESS ASSAULT ON THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT 
THE LOSS OF LIFE CONVINCED MANY OUTSIDE SPAIN THEY HAD TO MAKE A STAND 
THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS 
MANY OF THEM COMMUNISTS 
FLOCKED TO JOIN THE INTERNATIONAL BRIGADE AND FIGHT FASCISM 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE MUSSOLINI'S FORCES INVADED ETHIOPIA 
THE ETHIOPIANS STOOD NO CHANCE AGAINST THE MODERN ARMY 
THOUGH THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS ISSUED RESOLUTION AFTER RESOLUTION 
THE ITALIANS DEFIED THEM 
TODAY HAILE SELASSIE COMES TO PLEAD FOR HIS LOST EMPIRE 
HE WANTS THEM TO MAKE MUSSOLINI GIVE UP ETHIOPIA 
I CALL UPON THE FIRST DELEGATE FROM ETHIOPIA 
THE ITALIAN NEWSPAPER MEN ARE READY FOR AN OUTBREAK 
AGAINST THE EMPEROR WHOSE COUNTRY THEIR COUNTRY HAS TAKEN 
WAITING FOR HIS FIRST WORDS 
TRYING TO QUELL THE DISTURBANCE LIGHTS TURNED OUT 
THE DISTURBERS EJECTED ARRESTED AND HE IS ABLE TO MAKE HIS APPEAL 
BUT THE LEAGUE LACKED THE WILL TO HELP THE EMPEROR 
THE FAILURE TO SAVE ETHIOPIA CAME JUST AS THE LEAGUE MOVED INTO NEW HEADQUARTERS 
A MONUMENT TO THE DREAM OF WOODROW WILSON 
THE MAGNIFICENT BUILDING 
WAS SAID TO BE SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR PEACE MAKING 
BUT IN THE MEANTIME 
THE LEAGUE HAD BEEN DEFIED BY MUSSOLINI'S INVASION OF ETHIOPIA 
AS WELL AS JAPAN'S SEIZURE OF MANCHURIA 
AMERICA STILL WASN'T A MEMBER 
GERMANY HAD BEEN ADMITTED BUT HITLER HAD TAKEN IT OUT AGAIN 
IN A LEAGUE FILM MADE TO ENLIST PUBLIC SUPPORT 
AN OFFICIAL LISTED THE BACKLOG OF WORK 
POLITICAL PROBLEMS ARE DEALT WITH BY THE COUNCIL OR THE ASSEMBLY 
AND FOR THIS PURPOSE THE POLITICAL SECTION PREPARES THE WORK AND EXECUTES THE DECISIONS 
HERE ARE SOME RECENT PROBLEMS 
THE CHINO JAPANESE DISPUTES 
THE ETHIOPIA ITALY DISPUTES 
THE CHACO DISPUTES 
THE LETICIA DISPUTES 
THE PROBLEMS OF DANZIG 
THE SETTLEMENT OF THE ASSYRIANS 
THE SAAR PLEBISCITES AND THE RETURN OF THE TERRITORY TO GERMANY 
WITH THE LEAGUE'S FAILURE TO DEAL WITH DICTATORS THE IDEA OF DISARMAMENT WAS DYING 
AT THE NEW HOME OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS IN GENEVA 
THE CHIEF NEWS IS OF NATIONS ARMY IT IS ANNOUNCED THAT BRITAIN WILL SPEND MORE ON ARMAMENTS WHY 
BECAUSE THE WHOLE WORLD IS ARMING 
JAPAN DEMANDS PARITY ON THE SEA WITH BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES 
GERMANY IS BUILDING AEROPLANES 
COMMERCIAL CRAFT BUT PERHAPS CONVERTIBLE 
AEROPLANES FOR ITALY THOUSANDS OF THEM LINED UP IN SPECTACULAR ARRAY 
MUSSOLINI HAS FOSTERED AN AIR FORCE WHICH CHALLENGES COMPARISON WITH THE FINEST IN THE WORLD 
FRANCE MAINTAINS HER MILITARY STRENGTH 
TRAINS ARTILLERY AND MECHANISES HER POWERFUL ARMY 
SHE DEMANDS SECURITY AND WILL NOT DISARM 
AND BRITAIN LONG CONTENT WITH DOMINANCE ON THE SEA 
CONTEMPLATES BIGGER ESTIMATES FOR ALL THREE SERVICES 
ONLY THE UNITED STATES KEPT OUT OF THE NEW ARMS RACE 
THE CATTLE PROWL AND THE COYOTES HOWL 
OUT ON THAT GREAT 
BUT BY NOW 
IT WAS HITLER THAT WAS EMERGING AS THE GREATEST THREAT TO PEACE 
HE WAS STARTING TO REDRAW THE MAP 
SINCE THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES WAS SIGNED IN NINETEEN NINETEEN THERE HAVE BEEN 
ONLY A FEW REALLY MOMENTOUS DAYS IN THE HISTORY OF EUROPE 
TODAY COMES ANOTHER SUCH MIGHTY MOMENT 
AS HITLER CARRIES NAZI EXPANSION ACROSS THE WATERS OF GERMANY INTO THE LAND OF HIS BIRTH 
THOUGH THE UNION WAS EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN BY VERSAILLES 
THE BRITISH AND FRENCH DID NOTHING 
GERMANY'S NEW NEIGHBOUR CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
REMAINED THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF THE STATES CREATED AFTER NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
WITH THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IT WAS A TRUE CHILD OF THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES 
ENDEAVOURING TO UNITE CZECHS SLOVAKS AND ITS GERMAN SPEAKERS 
UNDER THE ONE FLAG 
PRAGUE WAS THE THRIVING CAPITAL OF A COUNTRY WHICH HAD THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN CENTRAL EUROPE 
BASED ON THE INDUSTRY OF THE OLD AUSTRO HUNGARIAN EMPIRE 
BUT CZECHS FELT INCREASINGLY THREATENED 
WHEN HITLER SAID THAT THE GERMAN SPEAKING SUDETENLAND 
SHOULD BE PART OF GERMANY AGAIN 
THE CZECHS WERE DEFIANT 
WITH THEIR LARGE ARMY 
THE CZECHS PREPARED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST A GERMAN ATTACK 
TROOPS TOOK UP POSITIONS ALONG THE BORDER WITH GERMANY 
THEY STRENGTHENED THEIR DEFENCES 
THEY EXPECTED BRITAIN AND FRANCE THE STRONGEST REMAINING DEMOCRACIES WOULD COME TO THEIR AID 
THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS WAS NOW SHOWN TO BE IRRELEVANT 
BRITAIN AND FRANCE DECIDED TO SORT OUT THE PROBLEM WITH GERMANY AND MAKE A DEAL 
BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER MADE SEVERAL VISITS TO SEE HITLER 
THE BRITISH CROWDS REJOICED WHEN CHAMBERLAIN CAME BACK FROM MUNICH 
THEY BELIEVED WHAT EVERYONE WANTED TO BELIEVE 
THAT BY GIVING IN TO HITLER 
AND ALLOWING HIM TO HAVE THE SUDETENLAND PEACE HAD BEEN SECURED 
OUR PRIME MINISTER HAS COME BACK FROM HIS THIRD AND GREATEST JOURNEY 
THE SETTLEMENT OF THE CZECHOSLOVAKIAN PROBLEM 
WHICH HAS NOW BEEN ACHIEVED 
IS IN MY VIEW 
ONLY THE PRELUDE 
TO A LARGER SETTLEMENT 
IN WHICH ALL EUROPE MAY FIND PEACE 
THIS MORNING 
I HAD 
ANOTHER TALK WITH THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR HERR HITLER 
AND HERE IS THE PAPER 
WHICH BEARS HIS NAME UPON IT AS WELL AS MINE 
FRANCE'S PRIME MINISTER DALADIER 
ALSO FLEW HOME FROM MUNICH 
HE THOUGHT THE SETTLEMENT WAS A PRELUDE TO WAR NOT PEACE 
AND THAT HITLER WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED 
ETIENNE CROUY CHANEL WAS WITH HIM 
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SO OPPRESSIVE 
WHEN WE ARRIVED AT LE BOURGET THAT WHEN WE SAW THIS HUGE CROWD 
WE THOUGHT THEY MUST HAVE COME TO HISS AND BOO US 
WHEN WE STOPPED ON THE RUNWAY 
INSTEAD OF THE HISSING AND BOOING WE WERE EXPECTING 
THERE WAS A SEA OF APPLAUSE AND ENTHUSIASM TO GREET US 
THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO UNDERSTAND 
DALADIER TURNED ROUND I CAN STILL HEAR HIM 
TOWARDS THE MAN NEAREST TO HIM AND SAID 
THESE PEOPLE ARE MAD 
IT WAS THE HIGH POINT OF WISHFUL THINKING 
THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE AND BRITAIN WERE ELATED AND RELIEVED BUT THE CZECHS FELT BETRAYED 
THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS HAD DONE NOTHING FOR THEM 
CZECH SPEAKERS IN SUDETENLAND 
HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN LIVING IN NAZI GERMANY OR FLEEING THEIR HOMES AS REFUGEES 
MANY PEOPLE WERE LEAVING 
AND THEY WERE TERRIBLY DISTRESSED 
BECAUSE THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM 
TEN DAYS AFTER MUNICH GERMAN TROOPS CROSSED THE CZECH BORDER INTO THE SUDETENLAND 
ONCE MORE CARL NAGEL'S REGIMENT WAS THERE 
WHEN THE ORDER CAME AT TWO O'CLOCK TO MARCH IN PEACEFULLY 
WE LOADED UP THE VEHICLES 
GOT ON OUR HORSES 
AND MARCHED OVER THE BORDER 
THE SUDETEN GERMANS HAD ALREADY HURRIED TO THE BORDER 
THEY WELCOMED US WITH JOY AND WITH TEARS IN THEIR EYES 
WE WERE SO HAPPY WE CRIED 
WE WERE SCATTERING FLOWERS WE WERE COMPLETELY OVERJOYED 
I HAVE TO SAY IT THOUGH I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY IT 
BUT THIS WAS THE HAPPIEST DAY IN OUR LIVES FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY 
THAT AUTUMN 
THE CZECHS CELEBRATED THE ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR INDEPENDENCE 
WITH A SENSE OF FOREBODING 
TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE BIRTH OF THE COUNTRY 
AND THE CREATION OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS 
THEIR EXERCISE IN SELF DETERMINATION WAS DOOMED 
IN MARCH NINETEEN THIRTY NINE THE GERMANS INVADED THE REST OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
AND OCCUPIED PRAGUE 
JIRI STURSA WHO'D SEEN THE AUSTRIANS LEAVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
SAW THE GERMANS ARRIVE 
MY UNCLE CAME TO WATCH THAT MOMENT AND SAID 
THOSE BASTARDS MARCHED INTO PRAGUE PRAGUE IS OCCUPIED BY THE GERMAN ARMY 
HE WENT INTO TOWN 
AND SAW THAT THE GERMAN ARMOURED VEHICLES AND TROOPS WERE THERE 
WHAT COULD WE DO NOTHING 
WE COULDN'T FIGHT THEM WITH BARE HANDS 
THE FACT IS THOUGH 
PEOPLE SHOOK THEIR FISTS AT THEM 
THE GERMAN SPEAKING CZECHS 
AND I THINK EVEN THE SOLDIERS 
FELT EMBARRASSED 
THE GERMANS SEEM TO HAVE FELT THEY WERE HATED 
THEY MUST HAVE SEEN IT 
AS WE RODE THROUGH CZECHOSLOVAKIA THEY THREATENED US 
THEY CLENCHED THEIR FISTS 
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY SAID BUT THEY MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THEY DIDN'T WANT US 
THE INDEPENDENT NATION BORN IN NINETEEN NINETEEN NO LONGER EXISTED 
HITLER HAD OCCUPIED A NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY WITHOUT EVEN PRETENDING HE WAS UNITING GERMAN PEOPLE 
IN THIS HISTORIC HOUR THE FATE OF EUROPE AND PERHAPS 
THE WHOLE WORLD TREMBLES IN THE BALANCE 
THE MAP OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN SO RUTHLESSLY CHANGED 
DURING THE RECENT YEARS OF SO CALLED PEACE 
HAS NOW BECOME A MATTER OF VITAL INTEREST TO EVERY ONE OF US 
AUSTRIA AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA NOT TO MENTION ABYSSINIA AND ALBANIA 
HAVE CHANGED HANDS WITH APPALLING FACILITY 
THROUGHOUT THIS TIME BRITAIN HAS HELD TENACIOUSLY 
THAT NO PROBLEM CANNOT BE SOLVED BY PEACEFUL NEGOTIATION 
WERE THIS OPINION SHARED BY THE GERMAN REICH 
IT WOULD NOT NOW BE NECESSARY FOR BRITAIN TO STAND TO ARMS AGGRESSION MUST BE STOPPED 
THE GERMANS DID NOT HALT AND BY NOW THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
ANY HOPE THAT THE PROBLEM COULD BE SOLVED BY NEGOTIATION HAD GONE 
THAT SEPTEMBER 
GERMAN TROOPS INVADED POLAND 
THE QUESTION ALREADY TELLS US 
THAT THE POINT OF THE LEAGUE WAS TO PRESERVE PEACE 
LET'S PICK THAT UP AND LINK IT IN TO OUR OPENING SECTION 
DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF 
HAVE YOU ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT 
IF YOU'D TRIED TO PLAN THIS ESSAY EARLIER 
YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT DOING IT DIFFERENTLY 
HERE'S A SUMMARY OF THE POINTS TO REMEMBER 
THERE'S NO SUCH THING 
AS A COMPLETELY BIASED AND USELESS SOURCE 
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WHAT YOU CAN GET OUT OF THE BIASED SOURCE 
IN SOURCE QUESTIONS SQUEEZE THE EVIDENCE FOR MEANING 
IN TEXT SOURCES 
LOOK AT EVERY PHRASE AND SENTENCE TO GET WHAT YOU CAN OUT OF IT 
WITH PHOTOGRAPH SOURCES 
LOOK AROUND THE PICTURE DON'T BE CONTENT WITH FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
AND FOR CARTOONS 
THE CARTOONIST HAS TRIED TO INCLUDE EVERYTHING THAT IS SIGNIFICANT 
TRY AND PICK UP EVERY POINT THE CARTOONIST MAKES SQUEEZE THE EVIDENCE 
IT WILL BE USEFUL TO LEARN SOME OF THE CHARACTERS THAT CARTOONISTS USE 
TO SYMBOLISE CERTAIN COUNTRIES 
JOHN BULL FOR BRITAIN UNCLE SAM FOR THE U. S. A. THE BEAR FOR RUSSIA 
VISUALISE THESE CHARACTERS FOR COUNTRIES 
IN QUESTIONS THAT ASK YOU TO USE THE SOURCE AND YOUR OWN KNOWLEDGE 
START BY WRITING ABOUT THE SOURCE 
WHAT CAN YOU ACTUALLY SEE OR READ THERE IN FRONT OF YOU 
THEN THINK ABOUT WHAT THE SOURCE REMINDS YOU OF 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW THAT HELPS YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SOURCE BETTER 
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A COMPLETELY RELIABLE SOURCE 
EVERY SOURCE POSES SOME PROBLEMS 
DON'T SPEND TOO LONG ON ONE QUESTION 
IT'S EASIER TO GET A FEW MARKS FOR ALL QUESTIONS RATHER THAN FULL MARKS FOR ONE 
ALWAYS ANSWER THE QUESTION 
DON'T JUST USE IT AS A PEG ON WHICH TO HANG EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT A TOPIC 
A WAY TO MAKE SURE YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION 
IS TO PUT THE WORDS FROM THE QUESTION IN YOUR OPENING SENTENCE 
OR IN A LONG QUESTION AN ESSAY GO BACK TO THE QUESTION 
AND WRITE OUT SOME OF THE WORDS AS YOU COME TO YOUR CONCLUSION 
HAVE A CLOSE LOOK AT THE ATTRIBUTION OF THE SOURCE 
THAT WILL TELL YOU WHO MADE IT WROTE IT PHOTOGRAPHED IT DREW IT OR SAID IT 
IT WILL TELL YOU WHEN AND HELP YOU WORK OUT WHY THIS SOURCE WAS MADE 
FEEL FREE TO WRITE NOTES ON YOUR ANSWER BOOKLET JUST MAKE IT CLEAR WHERE THE NOTES END 
FOR LONGER HISTORY QUESTIONS MAKE YOUR ANSWER A BALANCED ONE 
FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S ABOUT THE USEFULNESS OF A SOURCE 
DON'T SAY THAT A SOURCE IS COMPLETELY USEFUL AND MARVELLOUS AND HAS NO PROBLEMS 
DON'T SAY IT'S USELESS EITHER TRY AND FIND A BALANCE 
INFORMATION WILL ONLY GET YOU CREDIT WHEN IT IS CLEARLY RELATED TO THE QUESTION 
DON'T JUST SAY EVERYTHING YOU KNOW 
FOR THOSE LONGER QUESTIONS ESSAY QUESTIONS CARRYING MORE MARKS 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE A PLAN 
YOU COULD JUST WRITE IT ON THE EXAM SCRIPT YOURSELF IF YOU LIKE 
IT SHOULDN'T BE JUST A LIST 
THINK OF A LOGICAL PATTERN TO YOUR ANSWER 
WHEN YOU'VE MADE YOUR PLAN LOOK BACK TO WHAT THE QUESTION REALLY SAYS 
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU REALLY BELIEVE ABOUT THAT 
PUT YOUR OWN VIEW IN THE FIRST FEW SENTENCES 
MAKE YOUR PLAN LEAD UP TO PROVING WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID 
TAKE CONTROL OF A QUESTION GIVE YOUR ANSWER SOME STRUCTURE 
ENSURE THAT THE FIRST LINE OF YOUR ANSWER AND CONCLUSION FOCUS FIRMLY ON THE QUESTION 
IN CAUSATION QUESTIONS THAT'S WHY QUESTIONS 
THERE'S ALWAYS MORE THAN ONE CAUSE OF A HISTORICAL EVENT 
IF YOU CAN MAKE A LIST OF CAUSES 
DON'T JUST LEAVE THEM AS A LIST 
BUT TRY AND THINK OF A GOOD ORDER FOR THEM LONG TERM SHORT TERM 
MOST IMPORTANT LEAST IMPORTANT CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER 
SOMETHING THAT MAKES A PATTERN 
BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ANSWERING AND THE TOPIC TITLES 
CHECK WITH YOUR TEACHER BEFORE THE EXAM 
BE FAMILIAR WITH THE ORDER OF EVENTS 
TALK ABOUT THE WRONG WAR OR REVOLUTION AND YOU'LL MISS VALUABLE MARKS 
I FOUND IT A LOT EASIER TO REMEMBER THE EVENTS RATHER THAN THE DATES 
I'M NOT SAYING DON'T REVISE DATES 
BUT IF YOU KNOW EVENTS YOU'RE GONNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT TIME 
THE EXAMINER'S GONNA KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ON ABOUT AND YOU GET LOTS OF BROWNIE POINTS 
I REMEMBER THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD MUCH BETTER THAN THINGS I'VE READ 
SO BY RECORDING MY NOTES ON TAPE I CAN LISTEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE DATES 
WRITTEN WORK SHOULD HAVE A BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END 
WITH SUBJECTS LIKE HISTORY WRITE ALL THE FACTS DOWN ON TABLES 
IT'S EASIER TO REMEMBER AND IN THE EXAM YOU CAN VISUALISE THE TABLES 
FOR HISTORY THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION TO LEARN 
I MAKE SHORT NOTES AND HIGHLIGHT KEY WORDS AND DATES 
WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR HISTORY EXAM 
ALWAYS START WITH THE QUESTION THAT GIVES YOU THE MOST MARKS 
AND WORK YOUR WAY DOWN FROM THERE 
FOR HISTORY I WASN'T SURE HOW TO REVISE 
SO I IMAGINED I WAS SOMEONE IN THE TIME I WAS STUDYING 
I RECORDED MY FEELINGS AND WHAT WAS GOING ON AND LISTENED BACK TO IT 
WHEN I REVISED FOR MY EXAM I PANICKED DON'T 
AN EASY WAY TO REMEMBER THINGS IS TO PUT PICTURES NEXT TO YOUR NOTES 
THE MORE HUMOROUS THE BETTER 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE NOTES COLOURFUL AND COLOUR CODE THEM 
IN HISTORY IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE DATES IN ONE COLOUR 
AND THE CORRESPONDING INCIDENT IN THE SAME COLOUR 
WHEN YOU REVISE THE COLOURS MAKE IT INTERESTING 
THE EASIEST WAY I FOUND WAS TO MAKE NOTES FROM MY CLASS NOTES 
AND MAKE NOTES FROM THEM AND THEN LEAVE IT A FEW DAYS 
AND THEN MAKE NOTES FROM MY NOTES AND MAKE NOTES AGAIN 
UNTIL I'D CONDENSED THEM DOWN SO THAT I COULD MEMORISE THEM 
DON'T LET REVISION TAKE OVER YOUR LIFE 
REVISE ONE UNIT AT A TIME THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
DON'T TRY AND DO THE WHOLE SUBJECT IN ONE GO 
I REVISE WITH QUIET SOOTHING MUSIC ON 
NOT CHART MUSIC AS YOU LOSE YOUR CONCENTRATION 
IF YOU DON'T DO WELL IN YOUR MOCK EXAMS THAT'S NOT THE END OF IT 
I GOT AN E. IN ONE OF MINE BUT IN THE ACTUAL EXAM I GOT AN A 
WHEN IT COMES TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS IN THINGS LIKE HISTORY OR ENGLISH 
MY TIP IS TO GET THE FIRST SENTENCE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR IN YOUR MIND 
BEFORE YOU WRITE IT DOWN 
IF YOU CAN GET THE FIRST SENTENCE RIGHT 
YOU'VE ESTABLISHED THE ARGUMENT AND THE REST WILL FLOW A LOT EASIER 
IT'S LIKE ON TELEVISION 
THERE'S NO SCRIPT ON OUR PROGRAMME IT'S PROBABLY OBVIOUS 
BUT JUST BEFORE WE GO ON THE AIR 
I GET IT CLEAR IN MY MIND WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY 
I GET THE FIRST SENTENCE OUT AND EVERYTHING ELSE FOLLOWS 
I FIND AS SOMEBODY WHO READS THE NEWS AND INTERVIEWS PEOPLE 
THAT TIME SPENT JUST READING THROUGH THE SCRIPTS I HAVE TO READ 
SAVES AN AWFUL LOT OF TROUBLE 
THAT CAN GO FOR EXAMS AND SCHOOL WORK JUST AS EASILY 
AND WHEN I'M INTERVIEWING SOMEBODY 
I PUT BUILDING BLOCKS OF WHAT I WANT TO TRY AND COVER IN THE INTERVIEW 
I DON'T PUT DOWN SPECIFIC QUESTIONS 
I PUT DOWN AREAS I FEEL MUST BE COVERED THAT GOES FOR EXAMS TOO 
YOU BLOCK OUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A MAP 
TO GUIDE YOU THROUGH WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
THAT'S THE END OF THE PROGRAMME ON MODERN WORLD HISTORY 
THE OTHER TWO PROGRAMMES ARE ON
