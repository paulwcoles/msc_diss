THIS IS JACKANORY JUNIOR 
HELLO I'M ART 
IN THIS STORY A MAN CALLED GULLIVER 
FINDS HIMSELF IN A STRANGE LAND 
THE STRANGE LAND IS CALLED LILLIPUT 
AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN IT ARE TINY 
TO GULLIVER THEY LOOK LIKE LITTLE ANTS 
BUT TO THE PEOPLE OF LILLIPUT GULLIVER LOOKS LIKE A GIANT 
THE STORY IS CALLED FIG'S GIANT 
FIG WAS SCARED OF A THOUSAND THINGS 
SCARED OF THE DARK AND OF GETTING LOST 
SCARED OF SPIDERS AND OTHER LONG LEGGED SHADOWS 
SHE WAS SCARED OF THE NEVER ENDING WAR 
AND HER DREAMS SWARMED WITH BELFUSCUNS THE ENEMIES OF LILLIPUT 
ARMED TO THEIR EGGY TEETH 
SHE HATED THE SIZE OF THE SEETHING SEA 
AND THE WEIGHT OF THE SKY ABOVE IT 
ONCE EVERYTHING FRIGHTENED FIG 
THEN GULLIVER CAME 
THE SUMMER STORM SCARED FIG TERRIBLY 
ITS THUNDER CRASHED AGAINST LILLIPUT LIKE CANNON FIRE 
ALL NIGHT SHE COULD HEAR THE SEA HUNTING FOR SHIPS TO SWALLOW 
SO SHE WAS GLAD WHEN BY MORNING THE STORM HAD DIED AWAY 
AND SHE COULD GO OUT TO PLAY WITH TOLGO HER DOG ON THE BEACH 
THAT WAS WHEN SHE SAW THEM 
TWO SAND BROWN TOWERS THEIR TOPS ROUNDED LIKE GRAVESTONES 
FIG RAN TO GET A BETTER VIEW 
IT'S A WHALE SHE WHISPERED 
BUT WHALES DON'T HAVE HANDS AS BIG AS SHEEP PENS 
OR FACES STUBBLY WITH BEARD 
BUT WORDS WOULD NOT COME BIG ENOUGH 
TO DESCRIBE THE MONSTER ON THE BEACH 
IT'S A MAN BREATHED FIG AND TOLGO HAD TO AGREE 
HE'S DEAD SAID FIG 
SHE CLIMBED THE LADDER OF FINGERS THEN OUT ALONG THE ARM 
UNTIL SHE REACHED THE CHEST COME UP TOLGO SHE SAID 
IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE 
SUDDENLY SHE HEARD IT 
THE BLUE WOOLLEN GROUND UNDER HER QUAKED WITH THE GIANT'S HEARTBEAT 
BANG BANG BANG 
THEN THE GIANT'S HEAD ROLLED SIDEWAYS 
IT WASN'T DEAD AT ALL 
THE DOG JUMPED ONE WAY FIG JUMPED THE OTHER 
BOOTS FULL OF SAND MOUTH EMPTY OF SPIT 
SHE PICKED UP HER HEELS AND RAN 
SHE RAN AND RAN UNTIL SHE REACHED THE CITY WALLS 
THERE'S A GIANT ON THE BEACH COME QUICK 
BUT NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE HER 
SO SHE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE TEMPLE TOWER AND RANG THE BELL 
CLANG CLANG CLANG 
THE WHOLE ARMY TURNED OUT THEN 
FOOT SOLDIERS ARCHERS AND CAVALRY 
WHAT ARE THE BELFUSCUNS INVADING 
HAVE THE BELFUSCUNS LANDED 
WHEN THEY SAW THE GIANT SOME TURNED AND RAN AWAY AGAIN 
THE REST FROZE WITH FRIGHT 
SHH DON'T WAKE HIM SAID FIG TO THE CAPTAIN 
SHH SAID THE CAPTAIN TO HIS TROOPS 
SHH SAID THE SOLDIERS TO THE SEAGULLS 
SQUAWK SAID THE SEAGULLS 
BUT STILL FIG'S GIANT DID NOT STIR 
HE DID NOT STIR EVEN WHILE THEY LASHED HIM DOWN WITH ROPE 
AT LAST WHEN HE WAS NETTED LIKE SUMMER STRAWBERRIES 
THEY BEGAN TO BE BRAVE AGAIN 
SWAGGERING ABOUT AND STICKING OUT THEIR TONGUES 
THAT'S PUT HIM IN HIS PLACE DECLARED THE CAPTAIN 
AT LAST THE GIANT OPENED HIS EYES AND FOUND HE COULD NOT MOVE 
POOR GIANT THOUGHT FIG SADLY 
I SHOULD HAVE KEPT YOU A SECRET 
THEN TWANG TWANG TWANG 
THE GIANT WAS BREAKING FREE 
SHOOT YELLED THE CAPTAIN SHOOT 
OUCH SAID THE GIANT AS ARROWS PRICKED HIS HANDS AND BODY 
POOR GIANT THOUGHT FIG 
I'M SORRY 
IT LOOKS HUNGRY SAID THE CAPTAIN 
BETTER FEED IT IN CASE IT HAS A MIND TO EAT US 
SO EVERYONE RAN TO FETCH FOOD AND HOW THE GIANT ATE 
WHOLE ROASTED SHEEP WHOLE SPITS OF CHICKEN THREE LOAVES AT A TIME 
FIG WAS JUST BALANCING ANOTHER BASKET OF LOAVES ON HER HEAD 
WHEN SHE SAW THE CAPTAIN POUR A BAG OF POWDER INTO A BARREL OF WINE 
NOW MEN HE SAID TAKE HIM THIS TO DRINK THAT SHOULD DO THE TRICK 
DON'T DRINK IT'S POISON SHOUTED FIG 
BUT HER GIANT WAS A FOREIGNER 
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF LILLIPUT 
HE SWIGGED DOWN THE WINE GLUG GLUG GLUG 
AND FELL INTO A DEEP DEEP SLEEP 
NOT POISONED AFTER ALL BUT DRUGGED 
SO THAT IS HOW FIG FOGEL CAME TO RIDE A GIANT 
ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE CITY 
THE ARMY BUILT A WOODEN PLATFORM ON WHEELS 
AND WINCHED HIM ABOARD FOR THE JOURNEY INLAND 
KNEELING ON HIS CHEST FIG THOUGHT 
YOU ARE MY GIANT I FOUND YOU I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU 
HE HAD TO HAVE SOMEWHERE TO LIVE 
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE A MAN OUT IN THE RAIN AND WIND 
EVEN IF HE IS AS BIG AS A TREE 
SO THE EMPEROR GAVE HIM FOR A PRISON 
THE HUGE RUINED TEMPLE ON THE HILL OUTSIDE TOWN 
FIG'S GIANT DID NOT ARGUE HE CRAWLED IN AND OUT 
THROUGH THE DOOR OF HIS DRAUGHTY PRISON LIKE A DOG IN A KENNEL 
FIG WENT UP THERE EVERY DAY TO TALK TO HIM 
IN TIME THE GIANT BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE SAID 
AND EVEN TO SPEAK A FEW WORDS OF LILLIPUTIAN 
HE SAID HIS NAME WAS GULLIVER LEMUEL GULLIVER 
PEOPLE CAME TO STARE AND POINT AT GULLIVER 
BUT FIG SIMPLY WENT THERE TO PLAY 
GULLIVER WAS HER FRIEND 
HE COULD THROW A BALL FOR TOLGO WHICH TOOK TEN MINUTES TO FETCH 
HE EVEN LET FIG PLAY IN HIS POCKETS 
WHAT MARVELLOUS THINGS THERE WERE IN THERE 
THERE WAS A COMB AS BIG AS A FENCE 
AND A PAIR OF ROUND WINDOWS JOINED TOGETHER WITH WIRE 
THERE WERE GOLD COINS AS BIG AS CARTWHEELS 
AND A SHEET BIG ENOUGH FOR THE EMPEROR'S BED 
BUT MOST MARVELLOUS OF ALL 
WAS A ROUND GOLD CHEST FULL OF COGS AND PIVOTS AND SPRINGS 
ALL WHIRRING AND WHIRLING ABOUT 
LIKE A HUGE MECHANICAL HEART 
TICK TICK TICK 
GULLIVER TOLD FIG HOW HE'D BEEN SHIPWRECKED BY THE STORM 
AND HOW IN HIS COUNTRY EVERYONE WAS AS BIG AS HE WAS 
I WOULDN'T HURT YOU LITTLE FIG 
NOR ANY OF YOUR COUNTRYMEN HE SAID NOT FOR THE WORLD 
THAT IS WHY FIG SCREWED UP ALL HER COURAGE 
WENT TO THE PALACE DOOR AND KNOCKED AT THE BIG GATE BAM BAM BAM 
PLEASE SET GULLIVER FREE SHE SAID TO THE EMPEROR 
MY GIANT'S A GOOD GIANT I GIVE YOU MY WORD ON IT 
NEXT DAY THE EMPEROR HIMSELF WENT TO VISIT GULLIVER 
ONE THING I MUST KNOW BEFORE WE FREE YOU GIANT 
AT WHICH END DO YOU OPEN A BOILED EGG 
GULLIVER TURNED TO FIG AND ASKED IS HE JOKING OR IS HE MAD 
SO FIG HAD TO EXPLAIN ABOUT THE WAR 
FOR MANY YEARS WE LILLIPUTIANS HAVE BEEN AT WAR 
WITH THE BELFUSCUNS ACROSS THE SEA 
BECAUSE THEY OPEN THEIR BOILED EGGS AT THE BIG END 
WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU OPEN EGGS AT THE POINTY END 
GULLIVER LISTENED CAREFULLY 
THEN HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED HO HO HO 
THE EMPEROR WAS PUZZLED WAR WAS A SERIOUS BUSINESS AFTER ALL 
GULLIVER SLAPPED HIS KNEES AND ROCKED TO AND FRO 
HOOTING POINTY END INDEED 
THE EMPEROR SMILED WARMLY 
AND ORDERED THE CHAINS TO BE TAKEN OFF AT ONCE GOOD ANSWER SIR 
I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU ARE A RIGHT THINKING MAN SIR 
AND A FRIEND TO LILLIPUT HE SAID 
NEXT DAY FIG WAS DOING ARITHMETIC 
WHEN THE TEACHER SCREAMED AND DROPPED A PILE OF BOOKS 
A FACE AS BIG AS A PLANET WAS BULGING IN AT THE WINDOW AH 
GOOD MORNING FIGGY SAID GULLIVER 
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE EMPEROR ABOUT EGGS 
AND I'VE HATCHED A PLAN 
CARE TO COME FOR A TRIP 
THANK YOU I'D BE DELIGHTED FIG REPLIED WHERE ARE WE GOING 
SHE ASKED AS SHE AND TOLGO RODE ALONG ON GULLIVER'S SHOULDER 
TO BELFUSCU TO STOP THIS RIDICULOUS WAR 
SUDDENLY FIG WAS NOT DELIGHTED NOT DELIGHTED AT ALL 
BUT THERE WAS NO GETTING DOWN NO GOING BACK 
GULLIVER STRODE DOWN TO THE BEACH AND WADED INTO THE SEA 
DEEPER AND DEEPER UNTIL FIG THOUGHT THEY WOULD BOTH DROWN FOR SURE 
AHEAD LAY THE COASTLINE OF BELFUSCU 
A HARBOUR CROWDED WITH SOLDIERS AND SAILORS 
AND THREE MASTED MEN O' WAR 
LIKE A SEA MONSTER GULLIVER ROSE FROM THE WAVES 
THEN ON HE WENT WADING WADING ASHORE 
SOMEWHERE ON LAND AN ALARM BELL BEGAN TO RING 
WITHIN THE HARBOUR WALLS GULLIVER CALMLY GATHERED ROPES 
INTO THE PALM OF HIS GIANT HAND 
THE STARTLED TROOPS SHOOK THEMSELVES AND RAISED THEIR BOWS 
ARROWS SWARMED INTO THE SKY 
BUT GULLIVER HAD ALREADY TURNED HIS BACK 
AND WAS WADING OUT AGAIN ACROSS THE HARBOUR 
HIS BODY FROSTED WITH SILVER BRISTLING ARROWS 
BEHIND HIM LIKE PARTY BALLOONS ON THE END OF THEIR STRING 
BOBBED THE WHOLE OF THE BELFUSCUN FLEET 
HEROES THEY CAME HOME FIG AND HER GIANT 
THEIR NAMES WERE SUNG IN SONGS AND WRITTEN IN HISTORY BOOKS 
EVERYONE DANCED IN THE STREETS 
BECAUSE THE GREAT BOILED EGG WAR HAD BEEN WON 
TOMORROW YOU SHALL GO BACK AND MAKE THE BELFUSCUNS OUR SLAVES 
DECLARED THE EMPEROR NO SAID GULLIVER I WON'T DO THAT 
ALL MEN SHOULD BE FREE OF WAR AND FREE OF SLAVERY 
I'M SORRY BUT NO 
THE EMPEROR TURNED VERY PALE 
THE DANCING STOPPED THE PEOPLE SCATTERED 
THE EMPEROR AND HIS MINISTERS OF STATE 
MET IN SECRET TO WHISPER AND PLAN 
WON'T MAKE SLAVES OF OUR ENEMIES WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS 
THE MAN IS TALKING TREASON WON'T DO WHAT WE WANT 
THE MAN IS PLAINLY A VILLAIN 
GULLIVER LEMUEL GULLIVER WAKE UP 
FIG HEAVED OPEN THE HEAVY TEMPLE DOORS 
THE BISHOP SAYS YOU'RE A SPY THE PRIME MINISTER SAYS YOU'RE A REBEL 
THE EMPEROR SAYS YOU'RE A TRAITOR I HEARD THEM WHISPERING 
GULLIVER SAT UP SO QUICKLY HE BANGED HIS HEAD 
THEY DECIDED NOT TO SHOOT YOU WITH POISONED ARROWS 
GOOD SAID GULLIVER PULLING ON HIS SHOES 
THEY DECIDED NOT TO BURN DOWN THE TEMPLE WITH YOU INSIDE 
HOW KIND SAID GULLIVER 
THEY DECIDED NOT TO SEND THE ARMY TO FIGHT YOU 
I SHOULD HOPE NOT SAID GULLIVER FASTENING HIS TROUSERS 
THEY DECIDED TO BLIND YOU INSTEAD 
FIG HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE SO ANGRY 
I'LL DANCE ON THEIR ROOFS 
I'LL EAT UP THEIR HARVESTS AND DRINK THEIR LAKES DRY BLIND ME 
THEN GULLIVER LOOKED DOWN AT FIG 
PLEASE DON'T SHE SAID 
OF COURSE I WON'T HE SAID 
HERE DRY YOUR EYES ON MY HANDKERCHIEF 
THE WHITE SHEET SMOTHERED FIG FROM HEAD TO FOOT 
BUT I'M NOT STAYING HERE TO BE BLINDED 
THERE'S FAR TOO MUCH IN THE WORLD I WANT TO SEE 
SO GULLIVER ROLLED HIS CLOTHES IN A BUNDLE AND WALKED DOWN TO THE SEA 
ON THE WAY HE SCOOPED UP A HANDFUL OF SHEEP 
AND PUT THEM IN HIS POCKETS LIKE HUMBUGS 
CHOOSING THE BIGGEST GALLEON IN THE HARBOUR HE PUT OUT TO SEA 
THOUGH THE SHIP WAS SCARCELY BIGGER THAN A BATH FOR HIM 
OVER THE HORIZON HE FLOATED ONE TINY GIANT ON THE ENDLESS SEA 
BACK IN ENGLAND 
HE LET THE LITTLE LILLIPUTIAN SHEEP LOOSE TO GRAZE IN A PUBLIC PARK 
WHERE THE GIANTS AND GIANTESSES CROWDED TO SEE THEM 
THOUGH THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE HOW HE'D COME BY THEM 
UNTIL FIG TOLD THEM TOO 
WELL WHO ELSE D'YOU THINK HE WOULD HAVE TRUSTED TO BE HIS SHEPHERD 
WHO ELSE HAD A SHEEPDOG THE RIGHT SIZE 
WHO ELSE WOULD HAVE KEPT HIM COMPANY ON THE LONG VOYAGE HOME 
WHO ELSE WOULD HE WANT TO WEAR LIKE A FEATHER IN HIS CAP 
COME WHAT MAY COME WHAT MIGHT 
WHEN HE SETS SAIL TOMORROW ON A NEW ADVENTURE 
FIG AND TOLGO WILL GO WITH HIM THEN TOO 
SEE YOU
