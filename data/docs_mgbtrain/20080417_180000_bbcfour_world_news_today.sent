THIS IS WORLD NEWS TODAY WITH ME ZEINAB 
BADAWI SOUTH 
REPLACED AS MEDIATOR IN THE 
ZIMBAWEAN CRISIS THAT'S THE LATEST 
DEMAND BY THE OPPOSITION LEADER 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
WHO INSISTS 
HE 
WON THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TWO 
WON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TWO WEEKS AGO HIS CALL COMES AS SOUTH 
AFRICA APPROVES PASSAGE 
CHINESE CARGO SHIP CARRYING ARMS TO 
ZIMBABWE 
A BRITISH PRIME MINISTER WITH A FEW 
DOMESTIC PROBLEMS BACK HOME MEETS 
THE THREE CANDIDATES WHO WANT TO 
BECOME PRESIDENT WE LOOK AT THE 
PROSPECTS FOR THE SPECIAL 
RELATIONSHIP RELATIONSHIP SIXTEEN THOUSAND SECURITY FORCES KEEP THE 
PUBLIC AND PRO TIBET PROTESTERS 
AWAY AS THE OLYMPIC TORCH TRAVELS 
THROUGH DELHI WE HEAR FROM A 
CHINESE WRITER WHO SPENT A YEAR IN 
TIBET TIBET RETURNING HOME THE FAMILIES WHO 
FLED SOUTHERN SUDAN DURING TWO 
DECADES OF CIVIL WAR 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OF FLOODING 
BACK TO SOUTH SUDAN AHEAD OF A 
HIGHLY POLITICAL POPULATION COUNT 
IT COULD SET THE STAGE FOR A HUGE 
CHANGE IN AFRICA'S LARGEST COUNTRY 
HELLO AND WELCOME THE CURRENT 
CRISIS AFTER THE DISPUTED 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN ZIMBABWE 
LAST MONTH HAS HEIGHTENED TENSIONS 
AND RAISED THE STAKES THE LEADER 
OF THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI HAS NOW CALLED ON 
ZAMBIA TO LEAD MEDIATION EFFORTS 
INSTEAD OF SOUTH AFRICA THE 
IMPASSE HAS LED THE AMERICANS AND 
OTHERS TO CALL ON AFRICA TO STEP UP 
TO THE PLATE AND FIND A RESOLUTION 
THE SITUATION HAS BEEN MADE MORE 
URGENT BY CONCERN 
THAT AN 
ARMS 
SHIPMENT IS BOUND 
FOR ZIMBABWE 
AND 
COULD BE USED TO SUPPRESS THE 
OPPOSITION PETER GRESTE REPORTS 
FROM SOUTH AFRICA BECAUSE THE B. B. C. 
IS BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE 
AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR OF MEDIATION 
BY SOUTH AFRICA'S PRESIDENT PROBLEM 
BECKY COMART ALMOST THREE WEEKS 
WITHOUT A RESULT IN ZIMBABWE'S 
ELECTION THE MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE LEADER MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI HAS RUN OUT OF PATIENCE 
WE WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT MBEKI 
FOR HIS EFFORTS BUT PRESIDENT 
MBEKI NEEDS TO BE RELIEVED FROM HIS 
DUTY HOWEVER WE ARE FAST THE 
PRESIDENT TO LEAD A NEW INITIATIVE 
TO URGE ANY DEAL WITH THE 
EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION WE FACE 
THIS MOMENT 
PRESIDENT MBEKI 
SERIOUSLY DAMAGED HIS CREDIBILITY 
AS A MEDIATOR OVER THE WEEKEND WHEN 
HE FLEW TO HARARE TO MEET ROBERT 
MUGABE AHEAD OF EMERGENCY SUMMIT OF 
REGIONAL PRESIDENTS TO THE M. D. C. AND 
MUCH OF THE WORLD'S DISMAY THABO 
MBEKI BRUSHED ASIDE ANY SUGGESTION 
THAT THE SITUATION CONSTITUTED A 
CRISIS 
THE LAW PROVIDES THAT THEY CRISIS SHOULD BE A SECOND ROUND SO THAT 
IS WHAT IS HAPPENING I WOULD NOT 
DESCRIBE THAT AS A CRISIS 
SO NOW 
THE M. P. C. WANTS THE ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT 
AND CHAIR OF THE REGION OF SOUTHERN 
AFRICA DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY TO 
TAKE THE LEAD THE M. P. C. WANTS HIM 
NOT JUST TO REPLACE THABO MBEKI BUT 
TO DISPATCH A HIGH LEVEL DELEGATION 
THAT WOULD STAY IN ZIMBABWE FOR AS 
LONG AS IT TAKES TO RESOLVE THE 
IMPASSE GIVEN INCREASING ANIMOSITY 
THAT MAY TAKE A LONG TIME THE GAP 
BETWEEN THE TWO WIDE AND ON 
THURSDAY WHEN THE SABBATH CAN 
GOVERNMENT CONFIRMED THAT A CHINESE 
SHIP ANCHORED OFF ITS COAST WAS 
LOADED WITH WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION 
BOUND FOR ZIMBABWE THE COUNTRY IS 
RECEIVING THE ARMS AT A TIME WHEN 
TWO THIRDS OF THE POPULATION DEPEND 
ON FOOD AID 
OUR CORRESPONDENT ALLAN LITTLE HAS 
SAT DOWN WITH MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND 
HE ASKED HIM WHY HE HAD CHANGED HIS 
MIND ABOUT PRESIDENT MUGABE'S 
FUTURE IF HE WAS NO LONGER IN POWER 
ROBERT MUGABE LOST AN ELECTION 
ROBERT MUGABE ROSE OUT OF THE 
MILITARY AND TO UNLEASH HIS 
BRUTALITY AGAINST THE PEOPLE FOR 
DARING TO VOTE AGAINST HIM I THINK 
THAT IS UNFORGIVABLE I THINK IT IS 
A NEW SITUATION THAT NEEDS 
REVISITING 
SO THE POLICY YOU HAVE REVISITING ARTICULATED CONSISTENTLY FOR EIGHT 
OR NINE YEARS THAT THEY WILL BE NO 
WOULD RETRIBUTION UNDER A 
TSVANGIRAI GOVERNMENT DOES THAT 
STILL HOLD 
NO I THINK IT IS 
UNFORGIVABLE AND WE NEED TO REVISIT 
THE POLICY 
WHAT SORT OF COURT 
WOULD TRIED MUGABE 
THERE ARE 
NATIONAL COURTS WE WILL SET UP A 
TRUTH AND JUSTICE COMMISSION BUT I 
THINK FOR SOMEBODY TO EMBARK ON A 
RED A RIB A RETRIBUTIVE AGENDA 
BECAUSE PEOPLE VOTED AGAINST HIM I 
THINK IT IS NO DIFFERENT FROM 
SIERRA LEONE 
HE WAS TRIED BY AN 
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT I I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT I'M SURE 
THAT EVEN THE LOCAL CRIMINAL COURT 
CAN CHARGE PEOPLE FOR THEIR 
EMISSIONS AND COMMISSIONS 
IS THAT 
AN OPTION FOR ROBERT MUGABE THAT 
YOU MIGHT GO FOR 
IT 
TO THE UN ONE 
DAY NO AND IF HE DOES 
NOT STEP 
DOWN IF 
HE 
DIGS HIS 
HEELS 
IN AND 
DEFIES THE 
REGION AND 
DEFIES WHAT 
YOU SEE AS THE POPULAR WILL WHAT 
IS YOUR STRATEGY 
I AM SURE THAT WE 
ALL HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT PERHAPS THE 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE AND THE SMOOTH 
TRANSITION WE ARE LOOKING AT HAS 
NOT BEEN ACHIEVED THAT WE NEED TO 
GO BACK TO THE TRENCHES AND FORM A 
NEW STRATEGY AND TO THE LEAVES 
THAT 
IS NOT 
AN OPTION WE HAVE 
WE 
HAVE TO 
MAKE 
SURE THAT 
WHAT WE 
HAVE DONE SO FAR IS COMPLETED HOW HOW IN CONCRETE TERMS SPECIFICALLY 
WHAT ACTIONS CAN YOU TAKE 
I CANNOT 
SAY IN A STRUGGLE YOU GO AND DO 
ONE TWO THREE THINGS BUT WHAT I 
CAN SAY IS THAT 
BEEN 
IN THE 
STRUGGLE 
FOR THE 
LAST 
NINE YEARS 
AND WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT WE 
CAN FACE FRUSTRATIONS BUT WE WE 
GROUP AND THE MOBIL ICE 
THAT WAS MORGAN TSVANGIRAI TALKING 
TO OUR CORRESPONDENT ALLAN LITTLE 
IN JOHANNESBURG 
THE TORTURED POP SO FAR OF THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH HAS GIVEN RISE TO ONE 
OF THE BIGGEST SECURITY OPERATIONS 
EVER MOUNTED FOR AN INANIMATE 
OBJECT THE INDIAN AUTHORITIES WERE 
TAKING NO CHANCES TODAY 
INTERNATIONAL TORCH RELAY FOR THE 
CHINESE OLYMPICS HAS PROVED SUCH A 
MAGNET FOR ANTI BEIJING PROTESTERS 
THAT THEY KEEP THE PUBLIC AT BAY AS 
THE CLAIM WOUND ITS WAY THROUGH 
DELHI TODAY INDIA IS HOME TO THE 
WORLD'S LARGEST TIBETAN EXILE 
COMMUNITY AND THEY HAD BEEN 
INTENDING TO HOLD MASS PROTEST IN 
DELHI AGAINST BEIJING HOWEVER 
CHINA IS INDIA'S BIGGEST ECONOMIC 
PARTNER SO DELHI IS KEEN NOT TO 
UPSET CHINA HERE IS OUR SOUTH ASIA 
CORRESPONDENT DAMIAN GRAMMATICAS 
DESERTED THE OLD IMPERIAL CENTRE 
OF DELHI LATER STOP FOR THE GLOBAL 
OLYMPIC JAMBOREE 
THE HEART THROB 
FOR MILLIONS 
IT IS A CLEAR WHO THE 
CHINESE GUARDS WERE WORRIED ABOUT 
THERE WAS NOBODY WATCHING PART OF 
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST DEMOCRACY 
SEALED OFF THE HEART OF THE 
WORLD'S BIGGEST DEMOCRACY 
THAT REPORT SEEMED TO GO TO BLACK 
WE COULD NOT SEE ANY PICTURES I 
THINK YOU MAY HAVE GOT THE GIST THE STORY 
WE SAW 
THAT 
HAS BEEN 
A MAGNET 
IN 
MANY COUNTRIES 
IT HAS GONE THROUGH LONDON PARIS 
DANTE CHINA PROTESTS SO THERE 
REALLY HAS BECOME A TERRIBLE THAT 
IS TO GO NIGHTMARE FOR THE 
COUNTRIES RECEIVING IT BUT IT IS 
ALSO LOOKING LIKE A PUBLIC 
RELATIONS DISASTER FOR THE CHINESE 
FAR FROM BEING A SHOWCASE FOR 
HOSTING OF THE OLYMPICS THIS YEAR 
FOR 
FLAME NOW HAS A 
TARNISHED IMAGE 
BEEN 
TALKING TO THE CHINESE WRITER AND 
FILM MAKER SUN SHUYUN WHO HAS JUST 
WRITTEN A BOOK CALLED A YEAR IN 
TIBET ABOUT HER TIME IN THE REGION 
SHE IS A NATIVE OF BEIJING WHY 
DOES SHE BELIEVE THE CHINESE 
LEADERSHIP UNDERESTIMATED THE LEVEL 
OF TIBETAN GRIEVANCES AS WELL AS 
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE 
CAUSE 
I THINK 
THE REAL PROBLEM IS CAUSE THE NATURE OF THE TIBETAN 
GRIEVANCES THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT A MATURE 
PROGRESS AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT 
SCHOOLS AND THE HOSPITALS AND ROADS 
BUT DON'T FORGET THE TIBETANS ARE 
FUNDAMENTALLY RELIGIOUS PEOPLE 
SPIRITUAL LIFE MEANS MORE TO THEM 
THAN MANY IN THEIR POCKETS AND 
THEY ARE CONCERNED BY THEIR CULTURE 
AND THEIR FAITH I THINK THE 
HARDEST THING FOR THEM IS BEING 
TOLD TO DENOUNCE THE DALAI LAMA 
THEY GOT THEY GOT I THINK IT IS 
REALLY WHERE IT HURTS THE MOST 
THAT IS ENOUGH I THINK TO 
OUTWEIGH ANY OF THE PROGRESS OF 
GRATITUDE WHICH THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT FEELS THEY ARE ENTITLED 
TO TWO 
YOU ARE RATHER UNUSUAL 
PERSON BECAUSE YOU HAVE MANY 
PERSPECTIVES YOU SPEND PART OF THE 
YEAR IN CHINA YOU ALSO LIVE IN 
LONDON AND NOW 
SPENT ABOUT A 
YEAR 
INTO DEBT 
SO 
YOU CAN 
SEE 
FROM ALL 
ANGLES IN 
A 
WAY DO 
YOU 
THINK IT 
IS FAIR 
TO 
SAY THAT 
PROTESTS WE HAVE SEEN 
THE 
WORLD HAVE 
BEEN A SENSE KIND OF 
WRECKED THE CHINESE COMING OUT 
PARTY IN THEIR HOSTING THE 
OLYMPICS 
I THINK THE CHINESE OLYMPICS DEFINITELY HAVE NOT EXPECTED THIS 
KIND OF PROTEST IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
PRESS IN THE LAST FOUR WEEKS THE 
COURAGE IN TIBET IS MORE THAN IN 
THE LAST TEN YEARS BUT I AM NOT 
SURE IF THE INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN 
FOR TIBET IS GOING IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION BECAUSE THE FOCUS IS NOW 
ON BOYCOTTING THE OLYMPICS AND FREE 
TIBET TIBETAN INDEPENDENCE IS 
NEVER ON THE AGENDA AS THE DALAI 
LAMA AS THE BALLET REITERATES 
BOYCOTTING THE GAME'S HAS TURNED 
THE CHINESE AGAINST THE WEST AND 
PERHAPS MADE THEM WITHDRAW THEIR 
SYMPATHY FOR TIBET THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO GIVE IN 
TO INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE SO WHAT 
IS REALLY NEEDED IS A CONSTRUCTIVE 
DIALOGUE THAT ADDRESSES THE TIBETAN 
GRIEVANCES AND ENSURES THE SURVIVAL 
OF THEIR UNIQUE CULTURE 
WHAT ARE 
THOSE GRIEVANCES AND THEIR UNIQUE 
CULTURE YOU HAVE TAUGHT TO 
TIBETANS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE IN 
THE CITY AND IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
HOW STRONG IS THEN NATIONALISM AND 
THE DESIRE FOR GREATER AUTONOMY IS 
IT VERY WIDESPREAD YOU HAVE TALKED 
IN THE VILLAGES YOU DO SEE THE 
TIBETANS DO STILL LIVE IN A 
TRADITIONAL WAY I THINK THE 
CULTURE IS SO STRONG AND THEIR 
TENACITY TO HOLD ON TO IT IS VERY 
IMPRESSIVE IN THIS VILLAGE THE 
CENTRAL CHARACTER IS THE SHAMAN 
WHO DECIDES ON THE MARRIAGE BIRTH 
AND DEATH WHICH HOSPITALS EVEN 
THE VILLAGERS GO TO OPERATION BUT 
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS TRADITION 
AND THE SCOTCH IS UNDER THREAT 
PARTICULARLY IN THE BIG CITIES THE 
THREAT COMES FROM MODERNISATION OR 
THE LARGE INFLUX OF CHINESE 
MIGRANTS AND ALSO FROM CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT POLICIES FOR EXAMPLE 
EDUCATION THIS IS THE AREA AT HIS 
MOST CONTENTIOUS THE TIBETANS WANT 
TO BE TAUGHT IN A ROW AND LANGUAGE 
THIS IS THERE SOMETHING THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT REALLY HAS TO ADDRESS 
WE HAVE HEARD FROM SOME CHINESE 
THAT THEY FEEL THAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE 
RIGHTS IN MID MARCH WERE BIASED 
AND DIDN'T PERHAPS SUFFICIENTLY 
REFLECT THE KIND OF FACILITY WHICH 
THEY HANG CHINESE IN LHASA GOT AND 
SOME OF THEM DIED APPARENTLY AND 
WERE ATTACKED WHEN YOU WERE IN 
TIBET DID YOU ENCOUNTER ANY 
HOSTILITIES AS A HANG CHINESE I I GOT ON REALLY WELL WITH THE 
TIBETANS ACTUALLY THEY JOKED THAT 
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TIBETAN IN MY 
PREVIOUS LIFE BECAUSE I SPEAK SOME 
TIBETAN I APPRECIATE THEIR 
BUDDHISM AND I EVEN EAT CORE MEAT 
WHICH THE CHINESE HATE BUT THERE 
WERE TOUGH MOMENTS I EAT RAW 
MEAT ONE DAY I WAS IN A 
RESTAURANT AND THE FOOD WAS NOT 
GOOD AND I SENT IT BACK THE 
TIBETAN MANAGERS WERE SO ANGRY 
BASICALLY SHE SAID BLOODY CHINESE 
GET OUT WE DON'T WANT YOU HERE 
YOU WILL WITH OTHER CHINESE NO NO THAT IS THE SAD THING I WAS WITH 
TWO TIBETANS AND THEY WERE MY GOOD 
THICK GOOD FRIENDS BUT THEY DID 
NOT WANT TO BE SEEN TO BE WITH ME 
AND THEY DID NOT EVEN SAY ONE WORD 
IN MY DEFENCE 
THAT WAS SUN SHUYUN WHO CAME INTO 
THE STUDIO A LITTLE EARLIER WE CAN 
BRING YOU A BRIEF LOOK AT THOSE 
PICTURES THAT 
WE COULD 
NOT BRING 
YOU IN 
THAT REPORT 
ABOUT 
THE INDIAN 
LEG OF THE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY 
THIS PASSED OFF WITHOUT INCIDENT 
BECAUSE THERE WAS TIGHT SECURITY TO 
WARD OF PROTECT DEMONSTRATORS 
THERE ARE ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND SECURITY 
PERSONNEL POLICE AND PARAMILITARY 
FORCES THE SILT OF THE HEART OF 
DELHI EXCLUDING ALMOST ALL MEMBERS 
OF THE PUBLIC HOWEVER THERE WERE 
A PROBE TO BET PROTESTS IN OTHER 
PART OF INDIA THEY WERE PRETTY 
BUT PROTESTS 
GORDON BROWN WAS MY SECOND DAY IN 
THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN MARKED 
BY MORE 
RUMBLINGS OF 
DISCONTENT AT 
HOME OVER HIS LEADERSHIP ONE 
MINISTERIAL AIDE HAS INDICATED SHE 
WILL BE RESIGNING THE PROMINENT 
LABOUR PEER LORD DESAI HAS 
QUESTIONED HIS STAYING IN THE JOB 
SAYING MR. BROWN HAD BEEN PUT ON 
THERE TO REMIND PEOPLE HOW GOOD 
TONY BLAIR WAS THIS EVENING 
GORDON BROWN IS HOLDING TALKS WITH 
PRESIDENT BUSH WHERE THE TWO 
LEADERS ARE EXPECTED TO DISCUSS THE 
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CRISIS AMID 
EXTENSIVE FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY MR. BAN 
MET THE THREE PEOPLE VYING TO 
BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES HE MET THE DEMOCRAT 
FRONT RUNNER BARACK OBAMA FOR THE 
FIRST TIME AND HIS RIVAL HILLARY 
CLINTON THE THEN 
WENT ON 
TO MEET 
THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE JOHN 
MCCAIN MCCAIN JOINING US NOW IS NILE GARDNER FROM 
THE MARGARET THATCHER CENTRE FOR 
FREEDOM AT THE CONSERVATIVE THINK 
TANK THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION IN 
WASHINGTON WHAT KIND OF IMPACT HAS 
HIS GORDON BROWN HAVE BEEN IN 
WASHINGTON 
VERY MIXED SO FAR I WASHINGTON THINK THAT MOST AMERICANS ARE NOT 
REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO GORDON 
BROWN'S VISIT HE IS VERY WROTE 
VERY LOW 
PROFILE OVER 
HERE 
AMERICANS DON'T KNOW WHO 
HE IS 
THE 
POPE HAS 
BEEN IN TOWN AS WELL 
WHICH HAS OVERSHADOWED BRAMBLES AT 
TRICK SO THE TIMING HAS BEEN 
ABSOLUTELY GHASTLY ON THE OTHER 
HAND BROWN HAS MET THE THREE 
LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HE 
HAS ALSO GIVEN SOME STRONG 
STATEMENTS ON ZIMBABWE AND THE 
UNITED NATIONS WHICH MANY HUMAN 
RIGHTS ORGANISATIONS HAVE TAKEN 
NOTE OF SO THERE HAVE BEEN SOME 
POSITIVES SO FAR BUT IT REMAINS TO 
BE SEEN WHETHER HIS MEETINGS WITH 
PRESIDENT BUSH TODAY ARE 
CONSTRUCTIVE AND WHETHER THEY CAN 
ADVANCE THE ANGLO AMERICAN SPECIAL 
RELATIONSHIP AT A TIME WHEN THERE 
ARE SOME REAL TENSIONS BETWEEN 
LONDON AND WASHINGTON OVER MAJOR 
ISSUES 
THAT IS THE ODD THING ISSUES BECAUSE GORDON BROWN IS A MAN OF 
REALLY STRONG TRANSATLANTIC 
CREDENTIALS HE SAYS HE REALLY 
VALUES THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP 
AND YET HE DOESN'T QUITE SEE EYE TO 
EYE WITH GEORGE BUSH 
ON THE 
QUESTION 
TROOP 
WITHDRAWAL IS 
THAT GOING 
TO 
A BIT OF TENSION IN THE AIR I I THINK IT WILL IRAQ AFTER ALL IS 
THE TOP PRIORITY ISSUE FOR 
PRESIDENT BUSH THERE IS A SENSE IN 
WASHINGTON THAT GORDON BROWN IS 
RATHER HALF HEARTED OVER THE IRAQ 
OPERATION THE BRITISH WERE BARELY 
INVOLVED IN THE RECENT OFFENSIVE BY 
THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT AGAINST 
IRANIAN BACKED MILITIAS IN BASRA 
LARGE NUMBERS OF AMERICAN FORCES 
WERE INVOLVED IN THAT OPERATION 
ALSO THE U. S. AIR FORCE IS HEAVILY 
INVOLVED THE BRITISH STOOD ON THE 
SIDELINES THERE IS CERTAINLY I 
THINK A SENSE HERE THAT GORDON 
BROWN IS NOT COMMITTED TO THE WAR 
IN IRAQ THEY ARE ALSO DOUBTS OVER 
HIS OVERALL APPROACH TO THE WIDER 
WAR ON TERROR AFTER ALL THE WAR 
AGAINST TERROR HAS BEEN DROPPED 
ALTOGETHER FROM THE TERMINOLOGY OF 
THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION ALSO 
BROWN HAS SENT SOME CONFLICTING 
SIGNALS WITH REGARD TO AFGHANISTAN 
DES BROWNE HAS ADVOCATED TALKS WITH 
THE TALEBAN A VERY UNPOPULAR MOVE 
HERE IN WASHINGTON AND ALSO BROWN 
IS SEEN AS A RATHER WEAK AND 
LACKLUSTRE OVER THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR 
ISSUE HE SAYS HE CERTAINLY HAS 
BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY THE FRENCH 
PRESIDENT ON THAT QUESTION 
HOW AWARE ARE THE AMERICAN 
POLITICIANS ABOUT GORDON BROWN THE 
STYLE AND SOME OF HIS LEADERSHIP 
POLICIES 
THERE WILL BE A FAIR POLICIES AMOUNT OF AWARENESS HILARY CLINTON 
KNOWS GORDON BROWN QUITE WELL JOHN 
MCCAIN MET HIM RECENTLY BARACK 
OBAMA MET HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME 
TODAY BUT THE TWO KEY DEMOCRATIC 
LEADERS CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA 
ARE FOCUSING LRPBLG LARGELY ON 
THE PENNSYLVANIA PRIMARY THIS 
WEEKEND I THINK THEY WOULD RATHER 
HAVE BEEN IN PENNSYLVANIA FRANKLY 
RATHER THAN MEETING GORDON BROWN 
IT BOWLED HAVE CAUSED A HUGE 
DIPLOMATIC UPSET TO DECLINE THE 
MEETING WITH GORDON BROWN JOHN 
MCCAIN HAD SOME IMPORTANT 
DISCUSSIONS WITH GORDON BROWN ON 
THE IRAQ QUESTION THERE ARE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MCCAIN AND 
BROWN BRITON ON THAT ISSUE AND 
PERHAPS SIGNIFICANT TENSIONS 
NIALL NILE NILE GARDINER THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH 
KENYA'S NEW COALITION GOVERNMENT 
HAS BEEN SWORN IN WITH THE 
OPPOSITION LEADER RAILA ODINGA AS 
THE PRIME MINISTER HE WILL SHARE 
POWER WITH HIS FORMER RIVAL MWAI 
KIBAKI POLITICAL AND TRIBAL 
VIOLENCE AFTER DISPUTED ELECTIONS 
IN DECEMBER LED TO THE DEATHS OF 
SOME FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE AND TENS OF 
THOUSANDS REMAIN HOMELESS THE POPE 
BENEDICT THE SIXTEENTH HAS BEEN LEADING AN 
OPEN AIR MASS AT A BASEBALL STADIUM 
IN WASHINGTON IT IS DAY TWO OF HIS 
VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES IN FRONT 
OF FORTY SIX THOUSAND PILGRIMS THE POPE 
ADDRESSED THE CHILD SIX ABUSE 
PROBLEM WITHIN THE CLERGY HE SAID 
THAT NO WORDS COULD DESCRIBE THE 
PAIN INFLICTED ON THE VICTIMS 
HORTON H. R. T. HAS RETURNED HOME TO A 
HERO'S WELCOME AFTER HIS 
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT TWO MONTHS 
AGO CHEERS GREETED HIM AFTER HE 
STEPPED OFF A PLANE IN AUSTRALIA 
WHERE HE WAS RECEIVING MEDICAL 
TEEMENT TREATMENT HE NEARLY 
LOST N. I. S. LIFE IN FEBRUARY 
A SURGE IN BOUNDED ATTACKS IN 
WESTERN SUDAN IS FORCING THE UNITED 
NATIONS FOOD AGENCY TO HALF FOOD 
PROGRAMMES SIX OF ITS TRUCKS HAVE 
BEEN HI JACKED SINCE THE START OF 
THE YEAR TWENTY SIX DRIVERS ARE MISSING 
MANY SUDANESE ARE SURVIVING ON 
HANDOUTS HANDOUTS WHEN YOU MENTION THE SUDAN IT IS 
THE CRISIS IN DARFUR THAT COMES TO 
MIND THERE ARE PLENTY OF PROBLEMS 
ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY THERE IS 
CONCERN ABOUT THE LONG TERM 
PROSPECTS FOR PEACE IN SOUTHERN 
SUDDENAN THREE YEARS AGO A PEACE 
AGREEMENT ENDED A DECADE AGO 
MILLION PERISHED THEN THE DEAL SET 
OUT HOW FUTURE OIL WEALTH AND 
POWER SHARING WOULD BE DIVIDED 
CRUCIAL TO THIS IS A SENSUS TO 
DETERMINE THE POPULATION OF THE 
SOUTH REFUGEES ARE FINALLY 
RETURNING TO SOUTHERN SUDDENAN FOR 
THE COUNT NEXT WEEK BUT THE 
SOUTHERN GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED 
THAT NOT ENOUGH ARE GOING BACK 
AMBER HENSHAW HAS THIS SPECIAL 
REPORT REPORT BUSED BACK BY THE UNITED NATIONS 
DESPERATE TO GET HOME AFTER YEARS 
AWAY AWAY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FLED FROM SOUTH 
SUDDENAN DURING A CIVIL WAR THAT 
RAGED ACROSS THE REGION FOR MORE 
THAN TWO DECADES THEY'VE BEEN 
FLOODING BACK SINCE A PEACE DEAL 
BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH 
THREE YEARS AGO THERE HAS BEEN A 
HUGE SURGE THIS YEAR AHEAD OF A 
VITAL SENSUS 
BORN IN REFUGEE CAMPS MOST OF 
THESE CHILDREN HAVE NEVER EVEN SET 
FOOT INSIDE OF SUDDENAN NOW THEY 
ARE BACK WITH THEIR FAMILIES TO BE 
COUNTED COUNTED THIS WOMAN LOST EVERYTHING IN THE 
WAR SHE STRUGGLED TO SURVIVE WITH 
HER THREE CHILDREN IN A REFUGEE 
CAMP IN UGANDA 
SHE TOLD ME THAT LIFE WAS VERY HARD 
THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN DESPERATE 
TO GET BACK HOME SHE SAID SHE 
WANTED TO GET BACK NOW FOUR THE 
SENSUS SO SHE COULD BE COUNTED TO 
HELP THE SOUTH DEVELOPE 
EVERY SOUTHERNER WANTS TO GET 
BECOME INTO TIME FOR THE SENSUS SO 
THEY CAN BE REGISTERED THIS 
POPULATION COUNT WILL PAVE THE WAY 
FOR HUGE CHANGE ACROSS AFRICA'S 
BIGGEST COUNTRY AN ELECTION NEXT 
YEAR AND A REFERENDUM IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THAT 
COULD SEE THE SOUTH SPLIT FROM THE 
REST OF THE COUNTRY 
IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP 
SYMBOLICALLY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT AN 
EXERCISE OF THIS NATURE CAN TAKE 
PLACE IN SUDAN SUCCESSFULLY IT IS 
NOT AS COMPLICATED AS AN ELECTION 
BUT IT SHARES THE COMMON ELEMENTS 
THAT YOU SEE IN AN ELECTION IF IT 
CAN BE PULLED OFF IT IS A GOOD 
PRACTISE HEADING TOWARDS AN 
ELECTION IT IS IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON 
HOW THE SENSUS IS USED FOR THE 
ELECTION AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT 
ELECTIONS COULD BE SUCCESSFUL HERE 
IN SUDAN 
MUCH OF SOUTH SUDAN IS TOO 
DANGEROUS FOR PEOPLE TO RETURN TO 
HUGE SWATHES OF THE REGION ARE 
COVERED IN LANDMINES IT HAS MADE 
IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GET 
BACK HOME FOR THE SENSUS THE 
WORLD'S BIGGEST DEMINING OPERATION 
IS TAKING PLACE HERE IN SOUTH SUDAN 
HEFR DAY HUNDREDS OF DEMINERS ARE 
PAIN STAKINGLY CLEARING THE REGION 
IT'S A RACE AGAINST TIME SO THAT 
LAND LIKE THIS CAN BE GIVEN TO THE 
THOUSANDS OF SOUTHERNERS ARRIVING 
BACK HERE EVERY DAY 
THE CIVIL WAR DEVASTATED LARGE 
PARTS OF THE SOUTH LEAVING IT POOR 
AND UNDERDEVELOPED NOW THE PEACE 
AGREEMENT IS LOOKING FRAGILE MANY 
FEAR THERE COULD BE MORE CONFLICT 
AHEAD THERE HAVE BEEN CLASHES ON 
THE NORTH SLASH SOUTH BORDER THE TWO 
SIDES ARE STRUGGLING TO AGREE ON 
KEY AREAS OF THE PEACE DEAL 
STILL THERE ARE PROBLEMS 
THERE ARE CONTENTIOUS ISSUES THAT 
ARE STILL PEND ING SOLUTIONS 
BOTH SIDES ARE WORKING TO OVERCOME 
THEM THEM DELIGHTED TO BE BACK HOME AFTER SO 
MANY YEARS MARY IS ALL TOO AWARE 
OF THE CHALLENGES AHEAD FOR HER AND 
HER CHILDREN THEY HAVE BEEN GAVEN 
BASIC PROVISIONS TO GET THEIR NEW 
LIFE STARTED WHEN THEY RUN OUT IT 
WILL BE DOWN TO HER TO PROVIDE FOR 
THE FAMILY THERE IS NO SCHOOL OR 
HEALTHCARE FOR MILES AROUND THE 
VILLAGE IS SURROUNDED BY LANDMINES 
A FOREBODING START TO THEIR NEW 
BEGINNING BEGINNING JOINING US NOW FROM WASHINGTON IS 
SUDAN'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED 
STATES JOHN UKEC ARE YOU 
CONFIDENT THAT THE SENSUS IS GOING 
ACCORDING TO PLAN 
I BELIEVE SO 
SINCE THE PRESENCE DENSEY HAVE 
AGREED UPON IT WE BELIEVE THINGS 
WILL GO AS IT HAS BEEN STUDIED 
YOU ARE A VETERAN OF THE STRUGGLE 
IN SUDAN YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED 
ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR PEACE IN 
THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH ARE YOU 
DEFINITELY I GREW INTO THE WAR 
UNTIL THIS TIME I THINK THIS IS A 
TIME FOR IMPLEMENTATION THE SOUTH 
IS DISADVANTAGED IN SO MANY THINGS 
AS IT HAS BEEN IN WAR 
TO COME BACK TO BE ON ITS FEET TO 
MAKE THE PEOPLE COME DOWN THERE 
TAKE AS WHILE 
YOU KNOW TIME IS UP WE HAVE TO GO 
AND TRANSFORM SUDAN INTO A 
DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY 
THAT IS ALL TALK AM DAS BORE 
ISN'T IT OF COURSE THE SOUTHERN 
SUDANESE ACCUSE THE GOVERNMENT IN 
KHARTOUM OF DRAGGING THEIR FEET 
PRECISELY ABOUT IMPLEMENTING WHAT 
WAS AGREED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
THERE ARE SO 
MANY SIDES TO THAT THERE ARE A LOT 
OF DIFFICULTIES ON BOTH SIDES 
THERE ARE A LOT OF CONTEN SHUGS 
CONTENTIOUS PROBLEMS THAT MUST BE 
RESOLVED BY THE BEST THING IS BOTH 
SIDES ARE WORKING TO GET OVER IT 
THEY HAVE PROMISED THAT NOBODY IS 
GOING BACK TO WAR THE C. P. A. BELONGS 
TO THE PEOPLE OF SUDAN MOST HAVE 
SAID THEY WILL NOT GO BACK TO WAR 
I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT THE SENSUS 
WILL TAKE PLACE THERE ARE A LOT OF 
RESERVATIONS IN THE SOUTH THE 
PRESIDENCY IS WORKING ON THAT I 
BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THEM WILL BE 
RESOLVED RESOLVED YOU KNOW WITHIN BIG ISSUE THAT IS 
CREATING A GREAT DEAL OF TENSION 
INDEED CLASHES HAVE BEEN REPORTED 
BETWEEN THE NORTHERNERS AND THE 
SOUTHERNERS IS OVER THE DISPUTED 
REGION OF ABIYA RICH IN OIL YOU 
KNOW VERY WELL THAT THE SOUTHERN 
SUDANESE WALKED OUT OF THE 
GOVERNMENT AS THEY SAID THAT THE 
NORTHERN SOLDIERS REMAINED IN THE 
AREA AND THEY BELIEVED THAT THE 
OILFIELDS BELONGED TO THE 
SOUTHERNERS THAT IS A POTENTIALY 
DANGEROUS FLASH POINT 
I WOULD LIKE 
YOU TO KNOW THAT I WENT INTO THE 
WAR WHEN THERE WAS NO OIL IN THE 
SOUTH THE WAR IN THE SOUTH IS NOT 
ONLY ABOUT OIL WE DON'T WANT TO 
COMPLAIICATE IT THAT WAY BUT THE 
ISSUE IS BEING TACKLED BY BOTH 
SIDES THE GOVERNMENT OF SOUTHERN 
SUDAN THE MEMBERS OF THE 
GOVERNMENT THE MEMBERS OF S. P. L. DID 
MOVE OUT IN OCTOBER BUT THEY HAVE 
COME BACK AND SET UP A COMMUNITY 
THAT IS SOLVING THE PROBLEM 
THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE DRUMMING 
OUT THAT WE ARE GOING BACK TO WAR 
AN AGREEMENT IS AN AGREEMENT THE 
WORLD IS LOOKING AT THE SUDAN IN 
GENERAL GENERAL ON BOTH SIDES THEY ARE WORKING SO 
THAT THEY CAN SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS 
WE ARE NOT GOING BACK TO WAR AT ALL 
JOHN UKEC THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
TALKING WITH US

THABO MBEKI TO STEP DOWN AS THE 
MEDIATOR THIS IS WORLD NEWS TODAY

NEXT THE WEATHER 
THE CHILLY WEATHER WE HAVE HAD IS 
SET TO CONTINUE INTO THE WEEKEND 
THAT IS ALL THANKS TO THE WIND THE 
BREEZE IS WITH US TOMORROW IT WILL 
NOT JUST BE THE WIND TO CONTEND 
WITH TO FINISH OFF THE WEEK THERE 
WILL BE MORE CLOUD THERE IS A 
FRONT SITTING OVER THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE U. K. IN THE SOUTH 
ANOTHER FRONT YOU CAN SEE THERE 
WAITING TO PUSH ITS WAY EVER CLOSER 
FOR TOMORROW THAT WILL MEAN LOTS 
OF CLOUD BETWEEN THE PAIR OF THEM 
AND OUTBREAKS OF RAIN AFFECTING 
MANY PARTS OF THE U. K. ON AND OFF
