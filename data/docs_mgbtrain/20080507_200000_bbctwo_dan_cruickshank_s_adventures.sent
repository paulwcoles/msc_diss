THIS IS A JOURNEY TO EXPLORE THE ARCHITECTURE OF POWER 
IN ROMANIA THE IRON GRIP OF A DESPOT OVER HIS PEOPLE 
IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH 
THE ARCHITECTURE OF SLAVERY 
IN ISTANBUL 
IN KAZAKHSTAN ALIEN ARCHITECTURE TO ASSERT THE POWER OF A NEW NATION 
AND IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
A LAST BASTION OF THE CRUSADER KNIGHTS 
THE CAPITAL OF ROMANIA BUCHAREST 
A CITY THAT ONCE STRADDLED THE CULTURAL DIVIDE 
BETWEEN EASTERN AND WESTERN EUROPE KNOWN AS THE PARIS OF THE BALKANS 
BUCHAREST WAS TRANSFORMED IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BY NICOLAE CEAUSESCU 
EUROPE'S LAST COMMUNIST DICTATOR 
I'M HEADING TOWARDS THE PALACE OF THE PEOPLE 
ONE OF THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS MONUMENTS TO DESPOTIC RULE THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN 
THE PALACE WAS TO BE BOTH CEAUSESCU'S PERSONAL RESIDENCE 
AND HOME TO ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT 
A BUILDING THAT WOULD SECURE HIS GRIP ON POWER 
FROM HERE THE BUILDING'S AT ITS MOST OMINOUS MOST THREATENING 
THE WINDOWS LIKE HUNDREDS OF EYES OBSERVING 
AND CONTROLLING 
THIS IS THE EPITOME OF BIG BROTHER ARCHITECTURE 
GOLLY THIS INTERIOR IS POWER PERSONIFIED 
POWER ACHIEVED THROUGH INTIMIDATING SCALE THAT DWARFS 
AND THE USE OF RUTHLESS REPETITIVE 
CLASSICAL ARCHITECTURE 
CLASSICISM THAT'S IMPERSONAL THIS FUNEREAL WHITE MARBLE 
THE PALACE CONTAINS OVER ONE THOUSAND ROOMS 
A NEVER ENDING PARADE OF EXTRAVAGANCE 
IN FLOOR AREA IT'S THE LARGEST BUILDING IN THE WORLD AFTER THE PENTAGON IN WASHINGTON 
NO EXPENSE WAS SPARED 
THERE'S ESTIMATED TO BE OVER ONE MILLION TONNES OF MARBLE 
AND OVER THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TONNES OF CRYSTAL 
USED TO DECORATE THE LAVISH INTERIORS 
SEVEN HUNDRED ARCHITECTS AND TWENTY THOUSAND WORKERS 
TOILED IN SHIFTS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY 
THE OVERALL COST WAS SAID TO HAVE EXCEEDED TWO BILLION 
CEAUSESCU WANTED HIS PALACE TO BE A TRIUMPH FOR ROMANIA 
EVERYTHING FROM THE CHANDELIERS TO THE CARVINGS HAD TO BE MADE IN THE COUNTRY 
THIS IS THE ROOM IN WHICH CEAUSESCU WOULD'VE SIGNED DOCUMENTS OF STATE 
IT'S HUGE IT'S ABSURD 
THE CLIMAX OF THE BUILDING THE SIZE AND GRANDEUR OF THIS ROOM 
WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE VISITORS FEEL SMALL AND INSIGNIFICANT 
BEFORE THE MASTER STATESMAN 
IF YOU WERE LEFT IN ANY DOUBT THAT YOU WERE IN THE GRIPS OF A MAN OF POWER 
THEN YOU JUST HAD TO HAVE A LOOK FROM THIS BALCONY 
IT'S LIKE A KICK IN THE GUTS 
FROM HERE YOU CAN SEE THE SCALE OF CEAUSESCU'S MONSTROUS AMBITION 
IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT HE DESTROYED ONE FIFTH OF CENTRAL BUCHAREST 
TO CREATE A CEREMONIAL ROUTE TO HIS PALACE KNOWN AS THE BOULEVARD OF SOCIALIST VICTORY 
THIRTEEN CHURCHES AND OVER NINE THOUSAND HOMES WERE TORN DOWN 
DISPLACING AT LEAST FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
THIS WAS THE MOST VICIOUS ATTACK ON ARCHITECTURE AND HISTORY 
IN EUROPE SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
EVEN THOUGH THE ROMANIAN POPULATION WOULD SUFFER POWER CUTS AND FOOD SHORTAGES 
CEAUSESCU WAS DETERMINED HIS PALACE WOULD BE UNRIVALLED 
HE HELD A COMPETITION 
A YOUNG AND AMBITIOUS ARCHITECT WAS CHOSEN TO DO HIS BIDDING 
MANY PEOPLE MAY FIND THIS BUILDING OPPRESSIVE 
BECAUSE THEY LOST THEIR HOMES FOR ITS CONSTRUCTION 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE PEOPLE 
BUT CEAUSESCU WAS RUTHLESS AND OBSESSED 
THE PALACE WOULD PREVAIL AT ANY COST 
THIS VAST FORMAL ROOM WAS INTENDED FOR STATE RECEPTIONS 
IT'S CALLED THE BALLROOM 
I CAN'T IMAGINE THEY WOULD'VE BEEN VERY WARM THESE RECEPTIONS A VERY CHILLING INTERIOR 
IT WOULD BE DOMINATED BY GIGANTIC PORTRAITS 
OF CEAUSESCU AT ONE END AND HIS WIFE ELENA AT THE OTHER 
ALL WE HAVE NOW IS LARGE EMPTY MARBLE PANELS 
THE PAINTINGS WERE NEVER TO BE INSTALLED 
CEAUSESCU NEVER SAW HIS PALACE COMPLETED 
IN DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE TO HIS UTTER BEWILDERMENT THE PEOPLE AT LAST REBELLED AGAINST HIS RULE 
THREE DAYS LATER ON CHRISTMAS DAY 
CEAUSESCU AND HIS WIFE ELENA WERE EXECUTED BY FIRING SQUAD 
BUT HIS DEATH LEFT THE ROMANIAN PEOPLE WITH A DILEMMA 
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO WITH THE VAST MONUMENT 
THAT SYMBOLISED CEAUSESCU'S REIGN 
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS EXTRAORDINARY 
CEAUSESCU'S PALACE WAS TRANSFORMED INTO THE HOME OF ROMANIAN DEMOCRACY 
THIS GRANDIOSE ROOM IS THE SENATE 
IT WAS DESIGNED AS A GREAT HALL IN WHICH CEAUSESCU WOULD RECEIVE HEADS OF STATE 
THIS BUILDING IS RICH IN IRONY 
WHAT WAS TO BE THE DOMAIN OF A DESPOT 
HAS BECOME THE SYMBOL OF A NEW DEMOCRATIC ROMANIA 
WHAT WAS CEAUSESCU'S PALACE HAS NOW BECOME PALACE OF PARLIAMENT 
THE ROMANIAN PARLIAMENT BEGAN TO MOVE INTO THIS BUILDING IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
JUST FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DEATH OF THE DICTATOR 
THE PEOPLE ARE OBLIGED FOR PRACTICAL AND ECONOMIC REASONS 
TO USE A BUILDING THAT IS A MONUMENT TO THEIR OPPRESSION 
THIS LONG STRAIGHT BOULEVARD COMBINED WITH THIS DOMINEERING PALACE 
IS THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF AN ARCHITECTURAL DREAM 
THAT HAS HAUNTED THE IMAGINATION OF DESPOTS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
THIS IS POWER PERSONIFIED 
BUT I MUST SAY THIS IS THE GRIMMEST EXPRESSION OF THAT DREAM I HAVE EVER SEEN 
SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NOW 
THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY ARE LEARNING TO LIVE WITH THIS BUILDING 
BUT WILL THEY EVER LEARN TO LOVE IT 
ON THE SHORES OF THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN 
LIES A LAND SACRED TO JEWS CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS 
THE HOLY LAND 
OH SHUKRAN 
OFF THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST OF SYRIA STANDS ONE OF THE MOST HISTORICALLY 
IMPORTANT AND ARCHITECTURALLY POWERFUL CASTLES EVER BUILT 
FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
IT STOOD DEFIANTLY AT THE MEETING POINT OF TWO WORLDS 
THE MUSLIM AND THE CHRISTIAN AND IN THE END 
IT ALONE KEPT CHRISTIAN HOPES ALIVE IN THE HOLY LAND 
IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY MARQAB WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST CASTLES CONTROLLED BY THE CRUSADER KNIGHTS 
PART OF A MIGHTY EUROPEAN ARMY THAT FOUGHT TO RECLAIM THE HOLY LAND FOR THE CHRISTIAN FAITH 
BUT IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT SALADIN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MUSLIM COMMANDER HAD JUST DEFEATED THE CRUSADER ARMY 
AND ONE OF THE LAST GREAT BASTIONS THAT STOOD BETWEEN HIM 
AND CONTROL OF THE HOLY LAND WAS MARQAB 
SALADIN MUST HAVE STOOD JUST ABOUT HERE 
THIS LOCATION TO THE SOUTH EAST OF THE CASTLE IS THE BEST PLACE TO VIEW ITS DEFENSIVE WORKS 
A CONTEMPORARY CHRONICLE SAYS HE THOUGHT THE PLACE IMPREGNABLE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE 
IT'S VERY LARGE AND SET IN A NATURALLY STRONG POSITION 
THE PLATEAU TOP FORTIFIED 
WITH A SERIES OF WALLS AND MIGHTY ROUND TOWERS 
THE PHYSICAL POWER OF THE CASTLE ALLOWED IT TO COMMAND A HUGE AREA OF LAND 
EXTRACTING TRIBUTE FROM ITS NEIGHBOURS FOR ALMOST A CENTURY 
FOR SALADIN IT WAS BOTH A MILITARY AND AN ECONOMIC PRIZE 
SALADIN WILL ALSO HAVE NOTED THAT 
THE CASTLE'S MADE OF HARD VOLCANIC BASALT A VERY TOUGH MATERIAL 
AND HE'D HAVE RECOGNISED THAT THE CASTLE'S A FINE PIONEERING EXAMPLE OF THE SCIENCE OF MILITARY DESIGN 
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN 
THE BASIC PLAN OF THE CASTLE IS DICTATED BY NATURE 
THE ROCKY PLATEAU ON WHICH IT SITS IS TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE 
SO THE PERIMETER WALL IS BUILT 
AROUND THE EDGE OF THE TRIANGULAR PLATEAU 
THEN WITHIN THAT A HIGHER WALL IS CONSTRUCTED 
THAT OVERLOOKS THE OUTER ONE 
ALSO THE CASTLE DIVIDES IN TWO BY A GREAT WALL HERE 
THIS IS THE CASTLE TOWN 
UP TO ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVED THERE IN TWELVE HUNDRED 
THIS IS THE CITADEL AND HERE THE GREAT DONJON OR KEEP 
TO TAKE THE CASTLE YOU HAD TO TAKE THAT 
I'M IN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE PERIMETER WALLS 
IF I WERE AN ATTACKER I'D BE SUFFERING TERRIBLY 
BECAUSE THE DEFENDERS UP THERE ON THE HIGHER WALL WOULD BE SHOWERING MISSILES ONTO ME 
NOW HERE IS THE GATE TO THE CITADEL I'D HAVE TO BREAK MY WAY THROUGH THIS 
THAT'D BE QUITE DIFFICULT I'M SURE MASSIVE DEFENCE 
AND THEN I'D PENETRATE UP 
AND GOLLY I'M BAFFLED 
THERE ARE SEVERAL EXITS TO LEFT AND RIGHT WHAT AM I TO DO 
THIS IS LIKE ENTERING A LABYRINTH 
THE PLAN OF THE CITADEL IS COMPLICATED CONFUSING 
ALL CALCULATED TO CONFOUND ANY ATTACKER 
WHERE WOULD ONE GO 
THERE'S THESE NARROW ALLEYS ARCHES LEADING LEFT RIGHT UP AND DOWN 
THIS IS A FANTASTIC MACHINE OF WAR THIS CASTLE 
EVERYTHING'S DESIGNED TO HELP THE DEFENDER 
GIVE THEM SECURITY IN A HOSTILE LAND 
FOR EXAMPLE HERE THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE SORT OF 
DIFFERENT WAYS TO GO 
AN ARCH THERE STAIRS PLUNGING INTO THE BOWELS 
ANOTHER ARCH HERE 
THIS DIVIDES AGAIN WHERE ON EARTH WOULD AN ATTACKER GO 
WELL I'LL TRY THIS DIRECTION 
THIS IS THE GREAT HALL THE CONVIVIAL HEART OF THE CASTLE 
WHERE THE GARRISON WOULD HAVE DINED 
BUT EVEN THIS IS ESSENTIALLY 
A BIT OF RUTHLESS FUNCTIONAL MILITARY ARCHITECTURE 
PART OF THE FIGHTING CAPABILITY OF THE CASTLE 
IT'S VAULTED WITH STONE VERY STRONG 
THAT'S TO PROTECT IT 
FROM MISSILES BEING HURLED IN BY ENEMY CATAPULTS OUTSIDE 
ALSO THIS PROVIDES A VERY STRONG PLATFORM 
ON WHICH THE CASTLE'S CATAPULTS COULD BE MOUNTED 
TO FLING STONES BACK 
THIS CASTLE WASN'T JUST A FORTRESS IT WAS ALSO A MONASTERY 
BECAUSE THE CRUSADER KNIGHTS WHO HELD THIS CASTLE 
WERE ALSO A MILITARY ORDER OF MONKS WHO HAD COME TO THE HOLY LAND TO LOOK AFTER PILGRIMS 
THIS STUPENDOUS BUILDING WAS BUILT IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY AS A CHAPEL 
A FANTASTIC PIECE OF EARLY GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE 
THIS WAS AN AMAZING WORLD A WORLD WHERE 
HOLY MEN WERE FIGHTING FOR THE HOLY LAND 
THE MILITARY ORDER WAS THE KNIGHTS HOSPITALLERS 
ITS MEMBERS TOOK MONASTIC VOWS OF POVERTY CHASTITY OBEDIENCE 
AND IN THIS LITTLE SIDE CHAPEL IS SOMETHING VERY AMAZING 
A FRESCO THAT DATES FROM ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY 
IT SHOWS CHRIST WITH THE TWELVE DISCIPLES 
AND WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS THAT MANY OF THE FACES SURVIVE 
THESE ARE NOT THE FACES OF MEN 
ONLY OF PRAYER BUT THESE ARE THE FACES OF WARRIORS 
SURELY THESE ARE PORTRAITS OF THE HOSPITALLERS HERE AT THE TIME WHEN THIS FRESCO WAS PAINTED 
IT'S VERY MOVING THESE ARE 
THE FACES OF THE MEN THAT MADE THIS CASTLE GREAT 
THAT REBUILT IT AND ENLARGED IT THAT MADE IT ONE OF THE GREATEST CASTLES IN THE HOLY LAND 
MASSIVE DEFENCES COULD NOT ULTIMATELY SAVE THE CASTLE 
EVEN THIS MIGHTY KEEP WITH WALLS UP TO FIVE METRES THICK 
COULD NOT RESIST 
WHEN THE END CAME IT CAME FROM BELOW 
THESE GREAT WORKS WERE UNDERMINED AND SO THEY TUMBLED 
A MUSLIM FORCE ARRIVED IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE AND TUNNELLED BENEATH THE HUGE KEEP 
FATALLY WEAKENING THE CASTLE'S DEFENCES 
DOWNHEARTED WITH NO HOPE OF RELIEF 
THE CRUSADER KNIGHTS SURRENDERED 
AFTER A SIEGE HAD LASTED JUST FIVE WEEKS 
THE LOSS OF MARQAB MARKED THE END OF THE CRUSADER ADVENTURE 
THE DREAM OF A CHRISTIAN STATE IN THE HOLY LAND WAS OVER 
THIS CASTLE HAS A GRIM AND BROODING PRESENCE IN THE LANDSCAPE 
IT'S A DARK PLACE REALLY AN APPROPRIATE MONUMENT 
TO A PARTICULARLY BLOODY EPOCH OF HUMAN HISTORY THE CRUSADES 
THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN EAST AND WEST BETWEEN ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY 
A STRUGGLE WHICH STARTED WITH THE BLOODY TAKING BY THE CHRISTIANS OF JERUSALEM IN ONE THOUSAND NINETY NINE 
AN EVENT THAT SHOCKED THE MUSLIM WORLD 
SHOCKS IT STILL REALLY 
AN ACT OF BARBARITY UNDERTAKEN BY A RELIGION DEDICATED TO LOVE 
AND THIS CASTLE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE CRUSADES 
SO STANDING HERE ONE CANNOT HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE LEGACY OF THAT STRUGGLE 
THE FACT THAT IT STILL GOES ON IN A WAY 
THERE'S STILL RELIGIOUS WARS THERE'S STILL BLOODSHED 
THERE'S STILL PAIN AND SUFFERING IN THIS REGION 
AND THIS CASTLE IN A WAY AND ITS HISTORY 
MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THAT TRAGEDY 
NEW ORLEANS LOUISIANA IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH 
THIS IS A LAND WITH A TROUBLED PAST 
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER MADE THE CITY RICH 
BUT IT WASN'T JUST CROPS THAT WERE TRADED ALONG ITS LENGTH 
HUMAN BEINGS WERE ONCE SOLD DOWN THE RIVER TO WORK AS SLAVES 
THE CITY'S MOVED ON SINCE THEN BUT HURRICANE KATRINA OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
AND THE MASSIVE FLOODS THAT FOLLOWED REOPENED OLD WOUNDS 
FLY AWAY 
BY BY HALLELUJAH BY AND BY 
FLY Y. Y. FLY AWAY 
WONDERFUL I'LL FLY AWAY I LOVE IT 
REALLY GOOD 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON THE LEGACY OF SLAVERY IS 
I THINK SLAVERY IS STILL GOING ON CONTEMPORARY SLAVERY 
THE HURRICANE HIT US TOOK FOUR OR FIVE DAYS FOR THEM TO EVEN COME AND SEE IT 
MY PEOPLE WERE STUCK ON THE ROOF FOR THREE DAYS 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE SHACKLES ON MY FEET AND TO BE CHAINED UP FOR ME TO BE A SLAVE 
SLAVERY TO ME IS A MENTAL THING RIGHT NOW CONTEMPORARY 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING IT'S ALL CONTEMPORARY 
OUT OF THE CITY HUGGING THE BANKS OF THE MISSISSIPPI SNAKES LOUISIANA'S RIVER ROAD 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE NOW BUT FOR MUCH OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THIS WAS THE COUNTRY'S WEALTHIEST HIGHWAY THE HOME OF MILLIONAIRES 
AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE MASTERS AND THE SLAVES THEY OWNED 
IS WRITTEN INTO THE VERY ARCHITECTURE OF THE REGION 
THIS IS EVERGREEN 
BUT THE HARD LABOUR WENT ON BEHIND THE SCENES 
EVERGREEN'S PUBLIC FACE WAS THIS GRAND FAMILY MANSION 
DRAMATICALLY REMODELLED IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTIES BY ITS OWNER MICHEL PIERRE BECNEL 
BECNEL WAS AN AMBITIOUS MAN 
HE SAW HIMSELF AS MORE THAN JUST A FARMER HE WAS A GENTLEMAN 
AND HIS SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ASPIRATIONS ARE REFLECTED IN THE ARCHITECTURE HE COMMISSIONED 
HE DID EVERYTHING HE COULD TO MAGNIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS HOUSE 
AND BY DOING THAT TO MAGNIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS FAMILY 
THE SECRET OF THE SUCCESS HERE ARE THESE GIANT COLUMNS 
THEY REALLY PUT THIS HOUSE IN THE MAJOR LEAGUE 
THEY MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A GRAND MANSION 
ALSO THEY FULFIL A RATHER CLEVER VISUAL TRICK 
THEY MAKE WHAT IS QUITE A SMALL HOUSE LOOK VAST 
BECNEL SPENT SO MUCH ON EVERGREEN THAT HE WENT BANKRUPT 
BUT HE GOT THE GRANDEUR HE SO MUCH DESIRED 
THE DETAILS OF THE HOUSE ARE GREEK REVIVAL 
A STYLE THAT WAS INTERNATIONALLY FASHIONABLE IN THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY 
AND HERE IN FRONT OF ME IS A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE 
IN THE UNITED STATES GREEK REVIVAL ARCHITECTURE HAD A PARTICULAR MEANING AND IMPORTANCE 
IT ALMOST REPRESENTED NATIONAL IDENTITY IT REPRESENTED CIVILISATION LIBERTY AND FREEDOM 
BUT IN THE SOUTH IT WAS FAVOURED FOR PERHAPS LESS NOBLE REASONS 
BECAUSE GREECE HAD BEEN AN ANCIENT DEMOCRACY BUT A DEMOCRACY THAT SUPPORTED SLAVERY 
AND THE GREEK REVIVAL THEME IS CONTINUED 
IONIC CAPITALS HERE GREEK REVIVAL FIRE SURROUND 
AND THIS IS THE MAIN ENTERTAINING ROOM OF THE HOUSE 
HERE THE FAMILY WOULD HAVE GATHERED 
AND HERE THEY WOULD HAVE HELD PARTIES 
THIS DOOR IS THE CLUE A WIDE DOOR WITH A DOUBLE LEAF 
THAT'S TO ALLOW LADIES IN UM 
GREAT CRINOLINE DRESSES TO PASS THROUGH WITH EASE 
CIRCULATING AROUND THE INTERIOR 
AT THE BACK OF THE MANSION EVERYTHING IS ORDERED NEAT SYMMETRICAL 
THE OUTBUILDINGS LOOK LIKE CHESS PIECES ON A GREEN BOARD 
EVEN THE OUTDOOR PRIVY TEMPLE LIKE IN APPEARANCE IS AN ESSAY IN CLASSICAL GEOMETRY 
IT'S ALL DESIGNED TO SEND OUT A MESSAGE ABOUT MAN'S CONTROL OVER NATURE 
BUT ALSO SPEAKS OF MAN'S CONTROL OVER OTHER MEN 
BEHIND THE MANSION LIES A DIFFERENT WORLD 
THIS WAS WHERE EVERGREEN'S FIELD SLAVES LIVED 
IN CABINS SEPARATED FROM THE WORLD OF THE MASTER 
BUT LAID OUT WITH THE SAME SYMMETRICAL RIGOUR 
THE SLAVE QUARTERS HERE NOW LOOK CHARMINGLY PICTURESQUE 
THE CABINS IN A ROMANTIC STATE OF DECAY 
AND THEY'RE SHELTERED BY ENCHANTING SHADOWS 
CAST BY THIS AVENUE OF WONDERFUL OAK TREES 
BUT THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT WHEN SLAVES LIVED HERE 
THE OAKS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HERE THIS WAS A GRIM INDUSTRIAL ROAD 
WITH UNIFORM AND UTILITARIAN CABINS SET ON EACH SIDE 
AT ONE END WAS THE MILL 
AND AT THE OTHER THE RIVER ROAD AND THE MISSISSIPPI 
FEEDING THE SUGAR MILL WAS HARSH WORK 
AT HARVEST TIME THE SLAVES LABOURED SIXTEEN HOURS A DAY 
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TO REAP THE TALL TOUGH CROP 
THIS IS A COPY OF THE INVENTORY DRAWN UP WHEN BECNEL WENT BANKRUPT 
IT'S IN FRENCH THEN THE LEGAL LANGUAGE OF LOUISIANA 
AND OF COURSE IT LISTS HIS SLAVES 
AND HERE WE HAVE THEM EACH ONE IS NUMBERED NAMED 
AND HIS SORT OF PROFESSION TRADE DESCRIBED 
FOR EXAMPLE NUMBER TWO IS RANCON AGED THIRTY SEVEN DESCRIBED AS COMMANDER 
CAPABLE OF DIRECTING WORKS ON THE PLANTATION SO HE'S AN OVERSEER 
THEN THERE'S PHILL AGED THIRTY FOUR 
HE'S A SUGAR WORKER AND DESCRIBED HERE AS A NEGRO OF CONFIDENCE 
THAT MEANS HE WOULD BE TRUSTED TO GO DOWN THE RIVER BY HIMSELF TO NEW ORLEANS 
DELIVERING GOODS I GUESS SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT OF COURSE THESE SLAVES ARE LISTED IN THE INVENTORY BECAUSE THEY'RE MERELY ASSETS 
EACH ONE HAS A PRICE TAG NEXT TO HIS NAME IN DOLLARS 
IN THE END THESE HUMAN BEINGS WERE ONLY PROPERTY 
HOUSED SOMETIMES AS MANY AS SIXTEEN TO A CABIN 
GOSH PRETTY COMPACT ACCOMMODATION 
BUT IN FACT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS TWO HOUSES 
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A PARTITION DOWN HERE 
I CAN SEE THE MARK ON THE FLOOR 
SO IT'S A VERY MINIMAL CONSTRUCTION JUST TIMBER POSTS WITH BOARDING OUTSIDE 
PERHAPS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INSULATION BETWEEN BUT NEVERTHELESS 
I GUESS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY COLD IN THE WINTER 
HOT IN SUMMER 
IMAGINE THE LIFE IN HERE 
CROWDED 
THE SMELLS 
SOME COOKING THERE 
BUT ALSO I GUESS A LITTLE KITCHEN SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE 
ALONG WITH A PRIVY 
LIFE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY INTENSE 
KATHE WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO BE HERE 
H. M. M. 
I FIND THAT WHEN I BRING GROUPS HERE YOU'LL OFTENTIMES FIND 
ONE OR TWO PEOPLE WHO JUST JOURNEY OFF ON THEIR OWN 
AND YOU MAY FIND THEM STANDING ON A PORCH OR BESIDE A TREE 
AND THEY'RE CRYING 
JUST SOMETIMES VERY EMOTIONALLY CRYING 
YOU CAN ALMOST 
HEAR THE CHILDREN 
I CAN SEE PEOPLE SOMETIMES STANDING ON THE PORCH 
I CAN SEE PEOPLE COMING DOWN THIS LANE FROM THE FIELDS IN THE EVENING 
VERY VERY TIRED 
AND IF YOU'RE JUST QUIET AND JUST LISTEN 
YOU CAN HEAR IT AND FEEL IT THE SPIRIT OF MY ANCESTORS ALL AROUND THIS PLACE 
IT'S INCREDIBLY MOVING AND IMPORTANT THAT THE GRAND MANSION HOUSE 
AND THE HUMBLE SLAVE QUARTERS SURVIVE ON THE SAME PLANTATION 
THIS BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURE IS NOT TAINTED BY SLAVERY 
BUT IS PART OF THE SAME NARRATIVE 
THE SLAVE QUARTERS HERE ARE I SUPPOSE TO SOME 
AN EMBARRASSING SURVIVAL BUT THAT'S A GOOD THING 
FORGETFULNESS IS THE GREAT ENEMY 
WHILE SLAVE QUARTERS LIKE THAT SURVIVE PEOPLE ARE REMINDED OF 
THE EVIL THAT COMES WHEN MAN HAS POWER OVER MAN THE EVIL OF EXPLOITATION 
THE EVIL OF DOMINATION AND WHILE THAT MEMORY SURVIVES 
THOSE EVILS ONE HOPES CAN BE ERADICATED 
ISTANBUL 
THE ANCIENT HOME OF THE OTTOMAN SULTANS 
THIS WAS THE CAPITAL OF THEIR MIGHTY EMPIRE FROM THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY 
AND THE PLACE WHERE THEIR DYNASTY THRIVED FOR OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS 
I'VE COME TO ISTANBUL TO EXPLORE AN INSTITUTION IN THE FORMER OTTOMAN COURT 
THAT FOR CENTURIES HAS BEEN REVILED AND MISUNDERSTOOD 
BY PEOPLE IN THE WEST 
IT WAS A PLACE IT IS SAID IN WHICH MEN HAD ABSOLUTE POWER OVER WOMEN 
IT'S THE HAREM OF THE SULTANS 
THE HAREM IS A LABYRINTH OF NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED ROOMS 
MANY OF WHICH HAVE STILL NEVER BEEN SEEN BY THE PUBLIC 
THIS IS THE ARCHITECTURE OF A HIDDEN AND SECRET WORLD 
THAT IS STILL LARGELY WRITTEN OUT OF TURKISH HISTORY 
I'VE NOW ENTERED THE HAREM 
THIS GATE WAS GUARDED BY BLACK EUNUCHS 
THEY'D BE SITTING IN THIS ROOM ON THESE BENCHES 
STOPPING PEOPLE LIKE ME PROCEEDING BEYOND THIS POINT 
THE LIFE STORY OF THE EUNUCHS WAS PECULIAR INDEED 
THEY WERE SLAVES MOSTLY PURCHASED AS BOYS IN NORTH AFRICA AND EGYPT 
AND THEN CASTRATED EN ROUTE BACK TO ISTANBUL 
BRUTAL INDEED 
THE EUNUCHS LIVED IN THE ROOMS HERE 
THEY GUARDED THE SULTAN'S HAREM OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN 
IMAGINE THE ATMOSPHERE THE VEILED FURY THE FRUSTRATION 
THE HAREM WAS ENLARGED BY SULTAN MURAD THE THIRD IN THE LATE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
ESTIMATES VARY BUT IT'S THOUGHT THAT BETWEEN 
FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND WOMEN WERE LIVING WITHIN THESE WALLS DURING HIS REIGN 
MOST OF THE GIRLS WERE SLAVES PURCHASED AT SLAVE MARKETS 
CAPTURED IN WAR OR SIMPLY PRESENTED AS GIFTS 
AND SINCE ISLAMIC LAW FORBADE THE ENSLAVEMENT OF MUSLIMS 
VIRTUALLY ALL THE GIRLS HERE HAD BEEN BORN CHRISTIANS OR WERE JEWISH 
AND THIS IS WHERE THE NEW ARRIVALS LIVED 
THE GIRLS WERE VIRGINS WHEN THEY ARRIVED HERE GENERALLY NOT MORE THAN TWELVE YEARS OLD 
AND IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED TO ISLAM AND THEN HAREM TRAINED 
TAUGHT USEFUL SKILLS MUSIC EMBROIDERY TURKISH 
AND THEY SLEPT IN DORMITORIES UP HERE 
OVERSEEN AT NIGHT BY AN ELDERLY LADY TO ENSURE THERE'D BE NO SAPPHIC ACTIVITY 
SEX WAS STRICTLY CONTROLLED IN THE HAREM 
A RIGID HIERARCHY WAS IN PLACE 
ONLY THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED AND BEAUTIFUL GIRLS WOULD BE CHOSEN TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH THE SULTAN 
AND THESE FAVOURITES WOULD OFTEN BE HAND PICKED BY THE SULTAN'S OWN MOTHER 
WHEN CHOSEN A GIRL'S LIFE WOULD BE TRANSFORMED 
AFTER MURAD HAD SLEPT WITH A GIRL 
HER STATUS INCREASED LITERALLY OVERNIGHT 
AFTER ALL SHE COULD BE CARRYING A CHILD THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT SULTAN 
THE GIRL WAS MOVED HERE INTO THE FAVOURITES' COURTYARD 
GIVEN HER OWN APARTMENT AND STAFF HER OWN EUNUCH 
I SUPPOSE MOST GIRLS IN THE HAREM WANTED TO BE SELECTED AS FAVOURITES 
WERE FURIOUS IF NOT CHOSEN AND WERE JEALOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE 
MURAD IS SAID TO HAVE FATHERED NEARLY FIFTY CHILDREN 
ALL THE MALES WERE INSTANTLY CONSIDERED POTENTIAL HEIRS TO THE THRONE 
THIS FOSTERED A SAVAGELY COMPETITIVE ATMOSPHERE AMONGST THE MOTHERS 
AS THEY PROMOTED THE INTERESTS OF THEIR OWN CHILDREN 
THE HAREM WAS A HOTBED OF INTRIGUE 
ONLY THE CUNNING AND MANIPULATIVE COULD SUCCEED HERE COULD RISE TO THE TOP 
WOMEN WOULD SPY ON WOMEN 
WOMEN WOULD SPY ON THE COUNCIL OF STATE IF THEY COULD 
ON THE SULTAN HIMSELF 
THROUGH THAT WINDOW THERE THAT GRILLE THIS IS THE COUNCIL HALL 
EUNUCHS WOULD BE BRIBED 
IN THIS WORLD THERE WERE NO BOUNDARIES 
THIS WORLD OF SUBTLE INTRIGUE ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE 
MURDERS WERE UNDERTAKEN EVEN THE SULTAN HIMSELF COULD BE TOPPLED 
WHEN A SULTAN DIED OR WAS DEPOSED 
IT WAS A TERRIFYING MOMENT FOR THE INHABITANTS OF THE HAREM 
AS FAVOURITES WERE REPLACED AND THE BATTLE FOR THE SUCCESSION BEGAN AMONGST THE SONS 
MURAD WHEN HE BECAME SULTAN HAD ALL HIS BROTHERS EXECUTED 
SO THAT NONE OF THEM COULD CHALLENGE HIS POSSESSION OF THE THRONE 
THIS BLOODY SOLUTION WAS TYPICAL OF OTTOMAN RULERS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THIS RATHER EXTREME APPROACH 
TO SOLVING THE TRICKY PROBLEMS OF SUCCESSION WAS GRADUALLY REJECTED 
THE SULTANS PREFERRED TO KEEP THEIR BROTHERS IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY 
AND THESE ROOMS ARE WHERE THESE CHAPS WHILED AWAY THEIR TIME 
GORGEOUS INTERIORS VERY MUCH GILDED CAGES WITHIN THE HEART OF THE HAREM 
THE WOMAN WHOSE SON SURVIVED FAMILY STRUGGLES AND FRATRICIDE TO BECOME SULTAN 
WOULD HERSELF BECOME THE MOST POWERFUL WOMAN IN THE HAREM 
INDEED ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL WOMEN IN THE MUSLIM WORLD 
SHE BECAME THE VALIDE SULTAN THE QUEEN MOTHER 
AND THIS IS HER APARTMENT AN AMAZING PLACE 
YOU CAN FEEL HERE THE PRIVILEGE 
THE PRESTIGE THAT WENT WITH HER POSITION 
THIS APARTMENT THIS AMAZING PLACE IS SET AT THE VERY HEART OF THE HAREM 
FROM HERE SHE COULD SEE AND CONTROL EVERYTHING 
GOLLY THIS IS THE PRIVATE PART OF THE APARTMENT 
THIS IS WHERE THE QUEEN MOTHER WOULD SLEEP 
THE BED OVER THERE AND HERE IS HER PRAYER ROOM 
AND ON THE WALL IS MECCA 
GOLLY AND SHE WOULD PRAY HERE FACING MECCA 
THE QUEEN MOTHER AND HER SON THE SULTAN RULED THE EMPIRE FROM THIS HAREM 
IT IS IRONIC THAT THE SONS BORN HERE COULD BECOME HEADS OF THE GREATEST ISLAMIC DYNASTY ON EARTH 
AND YET THEIR MOTHERS HAD ALMOST INVARIABLY BEEN SLAVES 
AND HAD BEEN BORN NON MUSLIMS 
POWER WAS ACHIEVED AND MAINTAINED AT TREMENDOUS HUMAN COST 
IT'S TRUE THAT SLAVES WITHIN THE HAREM WERE EDUCATED 
AND THEY COULD RISE TO HIGH POSITIONS OF POWER IN THE LAND 
BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WITHIN ITS WALLS 
GIRLS WERE ENSLAVED AND TRAINED TO BE PUT AT THE DISPOSAL OF ONE MAN 
AND THOSE GIRLS WERE GUARDED BY MALE SLAVES WHO'D BEEN CASTRATED 
AND ALSO WITHIN THE HAREM THERE WAS A TRADITION OF BROTHER MURDERING BROTHER 
SO ALTHOUGH THE HAREM IS A FASCINATING AND EFFICIENT MACHINE OF STATE 
IT WAS SURELY IN THE END A DEADLY AND TERRIFYING PLACE 
THIS IS THE STEPPE OF CENTRAL ASIA 
THE VAST AND SNOWY PLAINS OF KAZAKHSTAN 
THIS IS A COUNTRY WITH LITTLE ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 
THE PEOPLE HAVE A NOMADIC TRADITION 
BUT IT'S HERE THAT THE FIRST NEW CAPITAL CITY OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IS BEING CREATED 
THIS IS A COUNTRY STARTING FROM AN ALMOST BLANK SLATE 
WHAT KIND OF CITY WILL THEY CREATE 
THE CITY AUTHORITIES HAVE ORGANISED THIS PAGEANT FOR ME 
IT DISPLAYS TRADITIONAL KAZAKH CULTURE 
THESE CHAPS ARE FIGHTING FOR THE BODY OF A DEAD SHEEP 
AND ONE SIDE WILL GET IT AND CARRY IT AND SCORE A GOAL 
IN THE BACKGROUND IS THE IMAGE OF THE CITY 
AND THAT IS THE STRANGE THING 
THE FUSION BETWEEN TRADITION HERE ON THIS PLAYING FIELD 
WITH MODERNITY MARCHING TOWARDS US THE FUSION OF THE TWO WORLDS 
THE MARRIAGE 
THIS IS ASTANA A NAME THAT SIMPLY MEANS CAPITAL 
KAZAKHSTAN ONLY BECAME INDEPENDENT IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE 
AFTER THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION 
AND FUELLED BY OIL RICHES THIS YOUNG NATION IS CREATING 
A SPACE AGE CAPITAL TO SHOW THAT IT'S A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH 
IT'S ASTONISHING AND VERY EXCITING TO SEE A CAPITAL CITY ARISING BEFORE ONE'S VERY EYES 
IN THE CENTRAL AREA HERE IT'S VERY MUCH A CONSTRUCTION SITE 
A WORK IN PROGRESS BUT THINGS ARE GOING AHEAD AT SOME SPEED 
ALSO HISTORICALLY IT'S VERY RARE TO SEE A CITY THAT'S THE VISION OF ONE MAN 
BUT THIS CITY ONE MAN'S VISION ONE MAN'S DREAM IS BEING REALISED ALL AROUND ME IN STEEL AND CONCRETE 
ASTANA IS BEING FORGED BY PRESIDENT NAZARBAYEV 
AN AUTHORITARIAN RULER WHO HAS LED THE NATION SINCE ITS CREATION 
IN THE LAST ELECTION HE RECEIVED AN IMPLAUSIBLE NINETY ONE PER CENT OF VOTES 
BUT WHILE THERE IS OIL WEALTH AND STABILITY 
NAZARBAYEV REMAINS POPULAR 
DESPITE HIS DECISION TO MOVE THE CAPITAL TO THIS REMOTE LOCATION 
THE EMERGING CITY CENTRE FEELS LIKE A GHOST TOWN 
BUT ONE KEY BUILDING IS CALCULATED TO ATTRACT THE PEOPLE 
IN FRONT OF ME IS A MIGHTY TOWER THAT MARKS THE SYMBOLIC HEART OF THE CITY 
IT REPRESENTS THE TREE OF LIFE THE BAITEREK 
CONNECTING THE EARTH TO THE HEAVENS 
IT'S NINETY SEVEN METRES HIGH BECAUSE IT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
THAT ASTANA WAS DECLARED THE CAPITAL OF THE NATION 
ON TOP IS A HUGE GOLDEN GLOBE 
THAT REFERS TO A KAZAKH MYTH OF THE SAMRUK BIRD 
WHICH EACH YEAR LAYS A MIGHTY GOLDEN EGG 
WHICH MARKS THE COMING OF SPRING AND SYMBOLISES THE SUN 
WITHIN THIS GREAT ORB THIS RATHER POWERFUL SYMBOL OF THE SUN 
IS AN UNUSUAL IMAGE A REPRESENTATION I SUPPOSE OF THE PRESIDENT 
AND HERE IT IS 
IT'S HIS HAND HIS HAND IMPRINT 
HE INVITES ALL WHO COME TO THE CITY TO PUT THEIR HAND IN HIS 
TO JOIN WITH HIM 
I'LL HAVE A GO IT'S A RATHER LARGE MITT HE'S GOT 
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS PLAYED 
ONE STANDS HERE THINKING OF THE GREAT LEADER 
LOOKING AT HIS PALACE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME 
CHARMING 
WHAT'S STRANGE OF COURSE IS THAT THIS IS AN UNUSUAL CULT OF THE PERSONALITY 
BECAUSE ONE WALKS AROUND THE CITY AND HIS NAME HIS POWER REALLY 
IS IMPRINTED IN EVERYTHING BUT THERE ARE NO IMAGES OF HIM 
EXCEPT HERE 
THIS IS THE ONE MOMENT ON ONE'S JOURNEY THROUGH HIS CITY 
THAT ONE ACTUALLY MEETS THE MAN 
THE PRESIDENT'S WILL IS ABSOLUTE 
KAZAKHSTAN IS TO BE REPRESENTED BY MODERN AND MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTURE 
MONEY IS NO OBJECT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO HIS OWN RESIDENCE 
AND HERE'S THE PRESIDENT'S PALACE 
STANDING IN AUTOCRATIC ISOLATION 
YET COMMANDING THE CENTRE OF THE CITY 
I GUESS ITS DOMINATING POSITION 
AND ITS RATHER GRANDIOSE CLASSICAL STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE 
CAN BE READ AS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN CENTRAL TO AFFAIRS 
UTTERLY IN COMMAND THE HEAD OF STATE IN EVERY WAY CONCEIVABLE 
THE AUDACITY OF NAZARBAYEV'S VISION CULMINATES IN THE MOST MYSTERIOUS SIGHT OF ALL 
A PYRAMID SURROUNDED NOT BY SAND BUT SNOW 
THIS IS THE PALACE OF PEACE AND RECONCILIATION 
A MONUMENT TO THE ARTISTIC AND SPIRITUAL LIFE OF KAZAKHSTAN 
DESIGNED BY BRITISH ARCHITECT NORMAN FOSTER 
ALL OF THE PRESIDENT'S HOPES FOR HIS NATION ARE VESTED HERE 
A SHOWPIECE FOR THE REINVENTION OF KAZAKHSTAN 
THIS IS VERY MUCH A PYRAMID OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
IT'S MADE OF MODERN MATERIALS AND IS A PIONEERING PIECE OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING 
EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS ARE THINGS OF MYSTERY 
WHAT SECRETS CAN THIS PYRAMID HOLD 
WOW A DARK A BLACK INTERIOR 
SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE EVERY DAY 
IT'S ASTONISHING CAVERNOUS CAVE LIKE 
VERY ELEMENTAL 
TO FIND OUT WHAT THE STORY IS I'LL START AT THE BOTTOM 
GOOD HEAVENS A THEATRE IN THE BOWELS OF THE BUILDING 
NOT A TOMB CHAMBER AS IN EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS BUT A LIVING VIBRANT OPERA HOUSE 
OF COURSE AN OPERA HOUSE 
THE UNIVERSAL SYMBOL THAT YOU'VE ARRIVED 
THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF ANY CAPITAL CITY WITH CULTURAL ASPIRATIONS 
IT'S AN AMAZING SPACE THIS SUBTERRANEAN 
BUT ABOVE ME PRESIDING OVER ALL IS A GIGANTIC IMAGE OF THE SUN 
I NOW RISE UP THE PYRAMID TOWARDS THE HEAVENS 
IT'S INTENDED TO SYMBOLISE THE JOURNEY OF THE KAZAKH NATION 
EMERGING FROM THE SHADOWS INTO A GLORIOUS NEW AGE 
I'VE ASCENDED BACK INTO THE LIGHT 
I'M NOW IN A FANTASTIC MINIMAL SOARING SPACE 
I'M AT THE VERY HEART OF THE PYRAMID 
BELOW ME IS THE OPERA HOUSE 
I'M STANDING ON TOP OF ITS SUN 
AND ABOVE ME IS THE APEX OF THE PYRAMID MY JOURNEY'S END 
THE BUILDING REACHES A CLIMAX WITH A DRAMATIC EXPLOSION OF LIGHT 
AS YOU ENTER PARADISE 
THERE'S ANOTHER DAZZLING SUN OVERHEAD AND DOTTED AROUND ARE THE IMAGES OF DOVES OF PEACE 
THIS IS WHERE THE PRESIDENT MEETS TO DISCUSS SPIRITUAL MATTERS 
AND NOW I THINK I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE 
THE MEANING OF THIS STRANGE AND EXOTIC STRUCTURE 
THE PRESIDENT IS IN EFFECT THE NEW SUN GOD 
THE MAN FROM WHOM ALL GLORY ALL POWER ALL LIGHT 
EMANATES IN HIS LAND 
AND HERE HE SITS AT THE TOP OF HIS PYRAMID 
CONTEMPLATING HIS CREATION HIS CITY HIS DREAM 
THE ARCHITECTURE HERE SPEAKS OF POWER YET TO COME 
ON MY LAST NIGHT IN ASTANA I TRY THE NATIONAL DISHES OF KAZAKHSTAN 
SHEEP'S HEAD AND HORSE MEAT 
THE SURVIVAL FOOD OF NOMADS TRANSFORMED INTO AN EXPENSIVE DELICACY 
HORSE I'M INTRIGUED TO TASTE 
OH GOSH 
WOW 
VERY PUNGENT 
VERY VERY VERY STRONG TASTE 
A TASTE YOU HAVE TO ACQUIRE THROUGH YEARS OF PERSEVERANCE 
HERE'S SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL 
GOD AMAZING 
THIS IS HORSE'S MILK 
IT'S LIKE RANCID YOGHURT 
INTERESTING ACTUALLY 
MEMORABLE 
ASTANA IS ALL ABOUT THIS CLASH BETWEEN TRADITION AND MODERNITY 
A HOME FOR A NOMADIC PEOPLE PACKAGED AS A MODERN THRUSTING METROPOLIS 
IT'S THE EXPRESSION OF THE POWER OF ONE MAN 
BUT ALTHOUGH DISPLAYS OF POWER CAN BE OPPRESSIVE THEY CAN ALSO PRODUCE ARCHITECTURE OF HIGH QUALITY 
HISTORY TEACHES THAT SOMETHING UGLY CAN CREATE SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL 
TELL ME WHAT TO DO TO GET MY LIFE BACK 
LAST THING I REMEMBER IS THIS MAN WHAT MAN 
THE GUY WITH THE HORN RIMMED GLASSES 
HOW DOES IT END NOT WELL I'M AFRAID
