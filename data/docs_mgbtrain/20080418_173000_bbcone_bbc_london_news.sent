GENERATION WOULD HAVE WITNESSED IN 
THEIR LIFETIME IN THE CITY 
THALIDOMIDE SURVIVORS WHO HAVE 
LIVED LONGER THAN MEDICALLY 
EXPECTED FIGHT TO MEET THE COST OF 
THEIR CARE 
AND LONDON'S RUGBY LEAGUE MINNOWS 
ARE FACING A TRULY BIG FISH THIS 
WEEKEND WEEKEND AND CAMDEN ROCKS AS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ACTS 
PREPARED TO PLAY TWENTY FIVE VENUES IN JUST 
TWO DAYS 
GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE 
PROGRAMME LONDON'S FINANCIAL HEART 
IS BRACING ITSELF FOR A ROCKY YEAR 
AHEAD AS JOBS ARE AXED AT THE 
WORLD'S BIGGEST BANK CITIGROUP 
HAVE BEEN HIT BY MULTI BILLION 
POUND LOSSES THIS YEAR AND WITH A 
WORKFORCE OF EIGHT THOUSAND IN THE CAPITAL 
THERE IS LIKELY TO BE A SIGNIFICANT 
IMPACT ON STAFF NUMBERS IT COMES 
THE DAY AFTER TWO THE BANKS 
ANNOUNCED ONE THOUSAND JOB LOSSES SOME 
ARE LISTS SAY THERE IS FAR WORSE TO 
COME FOR LONDON'S FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS SARAH HOW BAD IS THE 
SITUATION 
WHEN YOU ARE TALKING SITUATION ABOUT THE MARKETS IT IS ALWAYS 
DIFFICULT TO TELL FOR SURE WE ARE 
EVEN LESS CERTAIN TODAY THE MAIN 
BANKS INVOLVED HAVE NOT WANTED TO 
TALK TO US ON CAMERA NO ONE IS 
DENYING THE JOB LOSSES AND NOBODY 
IS DENYING THEY ARE AS BAD AS THEY 
HAVE BEEN FOR MANY YEARS 
JUST AFTER EIGHT A M. AT LIVERPOOL STREET 
STATION AND MANY CITY WORKERS ARE 
BRACING THEMSELVES FOR MORE BRAD 
NEWS ON REDUNDANCIES TWO BANKING 
GIANTS HAVE ANNOUNCED MORE THAN 
ONE THOUSAND LONDON STAFF WILL GO TODAY 
MORE BAD NEWS FROM THE BIGGEST BANK 
HALL NO ONE IT SEEMS CAN TAKE 
THEIR JOB FOR GRANTED 
PEOPLE WERE 
BEING A BIT CAUTIOUS YEAH THERE 
IS AN AIR OF NERVOUSNESS IN THE 
CITY YOU CAN NOTICE IT 
DO YOU 
WORRY THAT YOU MIGHT LOSE YOUR JOB 
YEAH IT IS WORRY FOR EVERYBODY 
EVERYBODY HAS GOT COMMITMENTS IT 
IS ALWAYS IN THE BACK OF EVERYONE'S 
MIND 
IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS IF MIND PEOPLE DON'T EXPECT IT THEY SHOULD 
EXPECT JOB LOSSES IT HAPPENS EVERY 
EIGHT OR TEN YEARS 
I'M NOT WORRIED 
REDUNDANCY PAYOUT AND I WILL MOVE 
ON 
FURTHER EAST THINGS ARE NOT ON GETTING ANY BETTER CITIGROUP IS 
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BANK ITS 
LONDON HEADQUARTERS IS BASED JUST 
ACROSS THE WATER IN CANARY WHARF 
WHERE IT EMPLOYS EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE ITS 
FIRST QUARTER RESULTS WERE 
PUBLISHED AND IT DID NOT MAKE 
COMFORTABLE READING WITH A HUGE 
LOSS OF TWO POINT FIVE BILLION THEY WILL NOT 
SAY EXACTLY HOW MANY JOBS THAT WILL 
MEAN LOSING HERE BUT THEY ADMIT 
THEY HAVE ALREADY STARTED LAYING 
PEOPLE OFF EXPERTS SAY IT COULD 
MEAN SHEDDING AS MANY AS ONE THOUSAND JOBS 
HERE IN THE CAPITAL 
SEAN SPRINGER HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT 
FINDING NEW JOBS FOR THOSE WHO ARE 
MADE REDUNDANT IN CITY BANKS AND 
CAPITAL MARKETS HE EXPECTS THERE 
TO BE JOB LOSSES ON A SCALE NOT 
SEEN FOR DECADES 
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR I REALLY 
PREDICT IT IS GOING TO BE AS BAD AS 
ANY ONE OF OUR GENERATION WOULD 
HAVE WITNESSED IN THEIR LIFETIME 
IT IS A PERFECT STORM IT IS NOT 
JUST THOSE DIRECTLY EMPLOYED BY THE 
BANKS WHO ARE FEELING THE PINCH 
TAXI DRIVERS WAITING FOR FARES 
OUTSIDE LIVERPOOL STREET STATION 
SAY TAKINGS ARE AS LOW AS MORALE OF 
THEIR CUSTOMERS 
SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT THAT GET IN 
THEY ARE LIKE PRIZEFIGHTERS 
EVERYONE HAS HAD ENOUGH THIS 
COUNTRY IS ROCK BOTTOM IT REALLY 
IS NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE FOREMOST FOREMOST BANKERS TODAY IT WAS A CASE OF 
HOPING FOR THE BEST ON THEIR JOBS 
BUT NOT ASSUMING THAT THEY WOULD 
STILL BE AT THEIR DESKS BY THE 
SUMMER SUMMER SO LET'S GET BACK TO THAT THORNY 
QUESTION OF HOW BAD THINGS ARE 
GOING TO BE L. HAVE SPOKEN TO MANY 
EXPERTS TODAY AND YOU CAN STILL 
FIND THE OPTIMIST PEOPLE WHO SAY 
IT IS A SHORT TERM BLIP AND BY 
SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER THINGS SHOULD 
START TO GET BACK TO NORMAL L. 
THINK NOW THERE ARE AN INCREASING 
NUMBER OF PESSIMISTIC PUNDITS 
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT AS MANY AS 
THIRTY FORTY THOUSAND JOB LOSSES IN THE CITY 
EVEN AN IMPACT ON LONDON'S POSITION 
OF THE LEADING FINANCIAL MARKET IN 
THE WORLD IT IS WORTH REMINDING 
PEOPLE THAT THIS STARTED IN AMERICA 
IF AMERICA SNEEZES WE CATCH A COLD 
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE CITY 
WITH A HANDKERCHIEF OUT L. L. THINK 
THE WEATHER IS MATCHING THE MOOD 
WE WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW WHAT 
HAPPENS THERE 
NOW THERE IS LOTS MORE TO COME 
INCLUDING WHY DOING THIS JUST 
PUTTING YOUR BAGS OUT FOR THE BIN 
MEN COULD LAND YOU WITH QUITE A 
HEAVY FINE 
NOW THE MORNING SICKNESS DRUG 
THALIDOMIDE KILLED THOUSANDS OF 
BABIES WHILE THOUSANDS MORE WERE 
LEFT WITH SEVERE DEFORMITIES THE 
VICTIMS' FAMILIES WON COMPENSATION 
BASED ON THE BELIEF THAT THE 
CHILDREN WHO SURVIVED WOULD NOT 
LIVE LONG NOW FIFTY YEARS ON MANY 
OF THE BABIES HAVE MADE IT THROUGH 
BUT THEIR CARERS ARE DYING OR 
GETTING TOO WELL TO LOOK AFTER THEM 
SO THERE IS A FIGHT TO GET THE 
FINANCIAL HELP THEY NEED TO CARRY 
ON WITH THEIR LIVES 
ONE OF THOSE TO HAVE SURVIVED 
AGAINST THE ODDS IS DOMINIC GALVIN 
HIS BRAIN DAMAGED AND DEPENDS ON 
HIS MUM FOR EVERYTHING 
SHALL WE 
DRESS YOU TODAY 
AS WELL AS SPOON 
FEEDING HIM HIS MOTHER STILL 
SHAVES HIM BRUSHES HIS TEETH AND 
EVEN DRESSES HIM 
HE DOESN'T HAVE 
ANY QUALITY OF LIFE ONLY THE LIFE 
THAT I MAKE FOR HIM THERE WAS 
NOTHING HE CAN DO HE CANNOT TAKE 
FLASHING LIGHTS HE WILL NEVER BE 
ABLE TO GET MARRIED OR HAVE 
CHILDREN HE CAN'T DAVE HIMSELF HE 
CAN'T DRESS HIMSELF FOR ORDINATOR 
LIKE MANY PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE 
LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES SADIE WAS PROVOKED 
PRESCRIBED THALIDOMIDE FOR MORNING 
SICKNESS BUT IT HAD A DEVASTATING 
EFFECT 
NINE TABLETS THREE DAYS EFFECT NINE LITTLE BITS OF POISON THAT 
RUINED HIS LIFE AND MY LIFE AS WELL 
AT EIGHTY ONE SHE IS GETTING ON AND 
STRUGGLING TO GIVE HER SON THE 
RELENTLESS CARE THAT HE NEEDS BUT 
REPLACING HERSELF WITH PROFESSIONAL 
CARERS IS NOT AN OPTION AT THE 
COST OF TWO THOUSAND A WEEK IT IS MONEY 
THAT SHE HAS NOT GOT 
THE BIG 
PROBLEM FOR THALIDOMIDERS ARE THAT 
THE PARENTS ARE DYING THE PEOPLE 
THEY RELY TO LOOK AFTER THEM ARE 
NOT AROUND ANY MORE THALIDOMIDERS 
ARE GOING TO HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME 
BUT THALIDOMIDERS HAVE SPENT THEIR 
LIVES FIGHTING FOR THEIR CAUSE AND 
THEY ARE DETERMINED TO WIN IN THE 
END THEIR AIM IS SIMPLE TO GET 
COMPENSATION FROM GRUNENTHAL THE 
GERMAN COMPANY THAT PRODUCED IT 
AMAZINGLY IT HAS NEVER PAID 
PENNY TO BRITISH SURVIVORS THEY 
HAVE RECEIVED PAYOUT FROM 
DISTRIBUTOR OF THE DRUG 
THEY MUST 
BE MADE TO PAY FOR THEIR CRIME 
THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT DREADFUL 
CRIME THEY COMMITTED 
THIS IS THE 
START OF SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER L. 
WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO GRUNENTHAL 
THIS IS ONLY A DRESS REHEARSAL YOU 
CAN RUN YOU CAN HIDE BUT NOT 
FOREVER 
JOINING ME IN THE STUDIO IS SUKESHI 
THAKKAR A THALIDOMIDE SURVIVOR WHO 
WORKS FOR THE THALIDOMIDE TRUST 
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT KIND OF 
FINANCIAL HELP IS AVAILABLE TO 
THESE SURVIVORS 
IN THE U. K. WE HAVE 
A TRUST RUN BY A VERY GOOD PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE INVESTED VERY WELL FOR US 
WE HAVE AN INCOME FROM THE TRUST 
THAT WE RECEIVE EVERY YEAR 
BUT NOW 
YOU ARE CLEARLY LOOKING FOR MORE 
MONEY FROM THE DRUGS COMPANY TELL 
US WHY THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND 
WHAT KIND OF THE BEST DIFFERENCE 
IT WOULD MAKE 
WE ARE SUFFERING 
BECAUSE AS WE ARE GROWING OLDER WE 
ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE ACHES AND 
PAINS IN OUR BODY IT MEANS MORE 
CARE IS NEEDED THAT MEANS MORE 
PHYSIOTHERAPY IS NEEDED FOR US WE 
JUST CAN'T AFFORD THAT BY OURSELVES 
GOING ON THE NATIONAL HEALTH MEANS 
WAITING FOR A LONG TIME FOR THAT 
CARE WHILE WE WAIT FOR THAT CARE 
WE DETERIORATE EVEN MORE SO THE 
MONEY IS NEEDED FOR MEDICAL REASONS 
AS WELL AS SURVIVAL REASONS 
AS WE 
HEARD A LOT OF THE CARERS LOOKING 
AFTER THE CHILDREN ARE GROWING 
OLDER WE EVEN DYING 
YES THE BEST 
CARE WE DO RECEIVE AND COULD EVER 
HOPE TO RECEIVE HIS FRAN NEAREST 
AND DEAREST THAT IS ONE OF THE 
ISSUES IS FROM OUR NEAREST AND 
DEAREST 
SUKESHI THAKKAR WE WILL DEAREST FOLLOW WHAT HAPPENS AND YOU 
THERE IS MORE ON THAT STORY TONIGHT 
ON INSIDE OUT AT SEVEN THIRTY P. M. ON B. B. C. ONE 
THE MOTHER OF A GIRL WHO WAS KILLED 
AT A RAILWAY CROSSING NEAR STAINES 
HAS RENEWED HER CALL FOR UNMANNED 
CROSSINGS TO BE SCRAPPED TEN YEAR 
OLD SOPHIE STOREY WAS ELECTROCUTED 
AFTER STRAYING ON TO A LIVE RAIL IN 
TWO THOUSAND THREE ON WEDNESDAY SIXTY SIX YEAR OLD 
THERESA MANSELL DIED AT THE SAME 
CROSSING AFTER HER FOOT BECAME 
TRAPPED TRAPPED A LONDON BASED MUSLIM ACTIVIST HAS 
BEEN JAILED FOR FOUR AND A HALF 
YEARS WHAT CAR RELATED OFFENCES 
ABU IZZADEEN WHO HECKLED THE 
FORMER HOME SECRETARY WAS FOUND 
GUILTY OF FUND RAISING AND INCITING 
TERRORISM SIMON KEELER A MUSLIM 
CONVERT RECEIVED THE SAME SENTENCE 
B. B. C. LONDON HAS LEARNED THAT 
TRANSPORT FOR LONDON HAS GIVEN THE 
RMT UNION AT THE WRITTEN GUARANTEES 
IT WANTED TO CALL OFF A PLANNED FORTY EIGHT 
HOUR STRIKE THE RMT UNION THAT 
PLANNED THE STRIKE FOR THE EVE OF 
THE MAYORAL ELECTION THE UNION 
WANTS STAFF TO COME UNDER THE TFL 
PENSION SCHEME 
HAVING SOMEONE RIFLE THROUGH YOUR 
RUBBISH TO GET PERSONAL DETAILS IS 
SOMETHING MANY OF US WOULD GUARD 
AGAINST NOW THERE ARE SOME 
COUNCILS IN LONDON DOING IT WITH 
THE BACKING OF THE LAW LEGISLATION 
WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE USED TO 
STOP FLYTIPPERS IS BEING USED TO 
CATCH RESIDENTS WHO LEAVE THEIR 
RUBBISH OUT FOR TOO LONG BEFORE 
COLLECTION COLLECTION WHEN WE THINK OF FLY TIPPING WE 
THINK OF THIS LORRIES DUMPING 
MELLOWED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 
THROBBING FURNITURE THEY CANNOT BE 
BOTHERED TO DISPOSE OF PROPERLY 
BUT IF YOU PUT YOUR RUBBISH OUT TOO 
EARLY FOR THE BIN MEN YOU TOO 
COULD BE BREAKING THE LAW 
NOBODY CAN SAY THEY WANT BAGS OF 
RUBBISH CLOGGING UP THEIR HOMES 
THEY COULD HAVE ANYTHING IN THEM 
WHEN THE SUMMER ONCE THINGS UP 
THEY START TO SMELL SURELY THEY 
BELONG OUTSIDE BUT THEREIN LIES 
THE PROBLEM WHERE DO YOU PUT YOUR 
BAGS PARTICULARLY IF YOU LIVE IN 
INNER CITY LONDON TAKE THIS FLAT 
THERE IS NOWHERE TO PUT THEM AT THE 
BACK BECAUSE IT BACKS ON TO PRIVATE 
PROPERTY AT THE FRONT THERE IS A 
PUBLIC HIGHWAY THERE IS NO BEEN 
BECAUSE IT WOULD CAUSE AN 
OBSTRUCTION THE ONLY OPTIONS YOU 
HAVE IS TO LEAVE THEM OUTSIDE AND 
HAVE A FINE OR TAKE IT BACK INSIDE 
AND KEEP IT THERE UNTIL RUBBISH 
COLLECTION DAY IF YOU LEAVE IT 
OUTSIDE YOU MAY FIND COUNCIL 
WORKERS' RIFLING THROUGH IT UNDER 
POWERS GIVEN TO THEM TWO YEARS AGO 
TO STOP FLY TIPPING SOME IN LONDON 
NOW GO AFTER RESIDENTS PUT IN THEIR 
BAGS OUT TOO EARLY IT IS WHAT 
HAPPENED TO THIS PUB IN SOUTHWICK 
WHICH HAS NO OUTSIDE SPACE WE WE RECEIVED A FIFTY FINE FOR HAVING A 
COUPLE OF BAGS OF RUBBISH OUT HERE 
THEY HAD GONE THROUGH CHECKING 
RECEIPTS AND LOOKING AT BOTTLES OF 
BEER 
THE COUNCILS SAY THEY HAVE BEER LITTLE CHOICE AND MOST RESIDENTS 
ARE ACTUALLY HAPPY BECAUSE IT KEEPS 
THEIR AREA TIDY 
IT IS WHAT PEOPLE 
ARE ASKING FOR PEOPLE DO WANT US 
TO ENFORCE AGAINST DIRTY STREETS SO 
THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IS NICER FOR 
PEOPLE 
SOME COUNCILS ISSUE PEOPLE HUNDREDS OF FINDS A YEAR THEY TEND 
TO BE EIGHTY OTHERS TOLD US THEY WANT 
TO CONCENTRATE ON THE MORE SERIOUS 
CASE OF FLY TIPPING WOULD YOU FIND 
YOURSELF HAVING TO PAY OR NOT WILL 
ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE COUNCIL'S 
DISCRETION AND WHERE YOU LIVE 
WEATHER WEATHER STILL TO COME BRINGING SOME 
CULTURE TO THE WEEKLY SHOP THE 
THEATRE GROUP STAGING SHAKESPEARE 
IN THE SUPERMARKET 
OVER ONE HUNDRED MUSICIANS ARE PREPARING TO 
PERFORM IN BARS AND CLUBS ON OR 
JUST OFF A NORTH LONDON STREET 
THIS WEEKEND'S CAMDEN CRAWL WILL BE 
A MUSIC LOVER'S PARADISE ALTHOUGH 
SOME LOCAL RESIDENTS WILL NOT BE 
TOO HAPPY WE HAVE BEEN TAKING A 
LOOK AT WHAT IS TO COME WITH HIS 
BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR NEWCOMERS TO 
MAKE A NAME FOR THEMSELVES CAMDEN 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF 
LONDON'S MUSIC SCENE OVER THE NEXT 
TWO DAYS AND TWO NIGHTS WE HAVE 
GOT THE CAMDEN CRAWL WITH A 
SMATTERING OF SPECIAL GUESTS L. HAVE COME DOWN TO MEET SOME OF THEM 
THE FESTIVAL HAS CERTAINLY GROWN

UNTIL TOMORROW NIGHT 
FOOTBALL NOW AND HE HAS BEEN 
RENAMED AVRAM GRUNT FOLLOWING 
CHELSEA'S ONE TO ZERO VICTORY AT EVERTON 
WHICH KEPT THE TITLE RACE ALIVE 
THAT IS BECAUSE AVRAM GRANT'S 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MEDIA HAS NOT 
BEEN TOO HOT 
FIRST OF ALL THEY HAVE HAD TO PLAY 
TWO GAMES IN THREE DAYS AND THEY 
ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT BUT AVRAM 
GRANT DOES NOT FEEL HE HAS HAD THE 
RESPECT FROM THE PRESS WHICH HE 
DESERVES I JUST FEEL THAT HE IS A 
STOP GAP FOR A NEW MANAGER NEXT 
YEAR HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
PRESS IS AT AN ALL TIME LOW HE 
GAVE VERY POOR INTERVIEW TO THE 
WRITTEN PRESS BUT HE SPOKE TO THE 
THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT 
YOUR JOB HAS IT BEEN HARD FOR YOU 
TO FOCUS 
NO I AM N. THIS LIFE O. MANY 
YEARS THE PRESSURE IS PART OF THIS 
ERM WE KNOW THAT THE JOURNALISTS 
SOMETIMES TRY TO DO A JOB

THE JOURNALIST THINK THAT IS A BAD 
SEASON MAYBE THEY ARE RIGHT DO DO YOU THINK IT IS FRUSTRATING IT'S IT'S O. K. PART OF LIFE 
A BIT MORE TALKATIVE THERE

LITTLE BIT 
MOVING ON TO RUGBY 
LEAGUE THERE IS A LOT OF IT ON 
RUGBY LEAGUE THIS WEEKEND 
IT'S A 
MASSIVE CLASH IT'S THE LONDON 
SCHOLARS THIS SUNDAY IN THE 
CHALLENGE CUP THE EQUIVALENT TO 
THE F. A. CUP THEY ARE TAKING ON ONE 
OF THE GREATEST TEAMS IN THE 
WORLD 
YES RUGBY LEAGUE HAS ITS ROOTS IN 
THE NORTH BUT BACKING WEMBLEY IN 
NINETEEN NINETY NINE LONDON PROVED THAT SOUTHERN 
SOFTIES COULD PLAY THE GAME 
RICHARD BRANSON'S LONDON BRONCOS 
MAY HAVE CHANGED INTO HARLEQUINS 
NOW BUT EVEN THEY ARE PLAYING 
SECOND FIDDLE THIS WEEKEND TO THE 
CAPITAL'S PART TIMERS MEET THE 
LONDON SCHOLARS THE CAPITAL'S 
SECOND BEST RUGBY LEAGUE TEAM 
HOWEVER THIS LOT ARE ALL PART 
TIMERS TIMERS THERE IS NO FULL TIME PROFESSIONALS 
AT OUR CLUB AS YOU CAN SEE A 
COUPLE OF GUYS HAVE GOT STUCK IN 
THE TRAFFIC ON THE WAY FROM WORK 
BUT ONCE WE GET HERE WE'RE ALL 
SWITCHED ON AND FOCUSED WE DO IT 
FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME WE ARE 
NOT ON BIG BUCKS 
ON SUNDAY IT'LL 
BE A DAY TO REMEMBER A CHANCE TO 
CAUSE AN UPSET A CHANCE TO BE 
NOTICED 
AND IT IS SEEN SENSATIONAL NON 
LEAGUE HAVANT AND AMP WATERLOOVILLE 
SERIOUSLY EMBARRASSED LIVERPOOL IN 
THE F. A. CUP THIS SEASON AND THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT THE SCHOLARS WANT TO 
DO TO SAINT HELENS ONE OF THE 
GRANDEST AND MOST SUCCESSFUL CLUBS 
OF ALL 
WE ARE GOING INTO THIS GAME TO WIN 
IT IF WE CAN MESS UP THE NORMAL 
JOURNEY THAT SAINT HELENS HAVE TO THE 
FINAL OF THE CHALLENGE CUP THEN WE 
WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT 
IT IS 
UNLIKELY THEY WILL WIN BUT IT'S 
THE CUP YOU NEVER KNOW 
THE OLYMPICS NOW TWENTY SIX SPORTS WILL BE 
PLAYED DURING THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS 
BUT I HEAR THERE ARE CALLS FOR SOME 
SPORTS TO BE GIVEN A DEMONSTRATION 
STATUS 
THAT'S RIGHT NETBALL IS STATUS NOT CURRENTLY GOING TO BE INVOLVED 
IN THE OLYMPICS BUT THE PRIME 
MINISTER WANTS IT TO BE INVOLVED 
TONIGHT THERE IS A GAME AGAINST 
MALAWI AT WEMBLEY ARENA AND WE 
WENT ALONG TO SEE THEM 
IT IS ALL OVER ENGLAND HAVE WON 
ENGLISH NETBALL IS THRIVING BRONZE 
MEDALLISTS AT THE COMMONWEALTH 
GAMES AND SEMI FINALISTS AT LAST 
YEAR'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IT IS A 
SPORT THE HOST NATION HAVE THE 
ABILITY TO WIN A MEDAL IN AT LONDON 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THERE IS JUST ONE PROBLEM 
NETBALL IS NOT AN OLYMPIC SPORT 
THE STAR PLAYERS WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
THAT CHANGE 
IT WOULD BE GREAT I 
LIVED JUST AROUND THE CORNER SO IT 
WOULD BE GREAT TO COMPETE IN IT 
WOULD BE GREAT FOR THE SPORT AS 
WELL 
AN UNLIKELY FAN HIS PRIME WELL MINISTER GORDON BROWN WHO SAID HE 
WOULD LIKE NETBALL INCLUDED AT THE 
LONDON OLYMPICS AT LEAST AS A 
DEMONSTRATION SPORT 
IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC TO SEE IT IN 
THERE IT IS THE BIGGEST WOMEN'S 
SPORT IN THE U. K. IT'S A GREAT 
SPECTATOR SPORT TOO YOU WILL SEE 
IT TONIGHT IT'S VERY PHYSICAL OUT 
THERE VERY FAST AND THE GIRLS ARE 
REALLY ATHLETIC DEMONSTRATION DEMONSTRATION SPORTS ARE NOT PART OF THE OFFICIAL 
PROGRAMME MEDALS ON LOT AT STAKE 
BUT NETBALL WOULD LOVE TO BE 
INVOLVED AT THAT LEVEL NONETHELESS 
IF IT WAS IN THE OLYMPICS IT WOULD 
JUST BE EVERYONE'S DREAM LONDON LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE MAY COME TOO SOON FOR NETBALL 
BUT THOSE RUNNING OUT AT WEMBLEY 
TONIGHT HOPE THAT ONE DAY THEY WILL 
BE ABLE TO SHOW OFF THEIR SKILLS ON 
THE OLYMPIC STAGE 
IT SEEMS POLITICIANS CANNOT RESIST 
GETTING INVOLVED IN A LITTLE BIT OF 
SPORT BACK TO FOOTBALL A BIG 
MATCH FOR FULHAM TOMORROW YES YES THEY PLAY LIVERPOOL TOMORROW AT THE 
COTTAGE THEY WON THEIR FIRST AWAY 
GAME IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGAINST BEDDING 
THE OTHER DAY IF THEY COULD BE 
LIVERPOOL THEY COULD EVEN CLIMB 
OUT OF THE BOTTOM THREE FAST 
MONOLOGUES AT THE MEAT COUNTER AND 
SONNETS AT THE SALAD BAR IF 
YOU'RE SHOPPING IN SOUTH EAST 
LONDON THIS WEEKEND THE WHOLE 
EXPERIENCE COULD TURN OUT TO BE 
MORE CULTURAL THAN YOU THINK A 
THEATRE COMPANY IS PUTTING ON SOME 
SHAKESPEARE INSPIRED PLAYS AT A 
SUPERMARKET IN LEE GREEN WE WENT 
TO THE REHEARSALS 
I AM NOT SURE THAT ANYONE WHO IS 
HERE TODAY SHOPPING HAS NEVER LOVED 
ANYONE SO MUCH THAT IT HURTS 
NOT YOUR USUAL ANNOUNCEMENT OVER 
THE TANNOY AT A SUPERMARKET THIS 
TIME IT IS CONFESSION OF LOVE 
IT WAS BRAVE LOVELY BUT I 
PROBABLY WOULD NOT DO IT MYSELF 
SHE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE THE BRIDE 
LOOKING FOR HER FUTURE HUSBAND IS 
HERE TOO BUT IT'S NOT NEW 
SINGLES CLUB IT'S THE START OF A 
WEEKEND OF SHAKESPEARIAN INSPIRED 
PLAYS ON SHOW AT A SUPERMARKET IN 
LEWISHAM 
IT WAS NICE TO SEE A BIT LEWISHAM OF CULTURE BEING BROUGHT BACK TO 
THE PEOPLE IN THE STORE IT'S QUITE 
GOOD I LIKE THAT IF THE IT TO 
MYSELF I HAVE DONE A BIT MYSELF 
SO IT'S QUITE GOOD NICE TO SEE 
EVERYONE SMILING 
THE ACTORS SOME 
OF THEM DRESSED AS SHOP WORKERS 
ARE HERE TO BRING A MODERN TWIST TO 
THEATRE TO BRING THE STAGE TO 
EVERYDAY SURROUNDINGS WORRYINGLY 
THE ACTORS HAVE GONE A BIT METHOD 
ON US AND HAVE STARTED STACKING 
SHELVES THERE IS ONE WE KEEP 
LOSING BECAUSE HE IS ALWAYS 
COLLECTING BASKETS IN BETWEEN 
SCENES BUT WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE 
THE CHARACTERS MORE REALISTIC SO 
THAT PEOPLE DID NOT COME IN AND GO 
OH IT'S SHAKESPEARE HE 
CHARACTERS ARE IMMEDIATELY 
RECOGNISABLE THE BRIDE MAY NOT 
HAVE GOT EVERYTHING ON HER SHOPPING 
LIST BUT FOR NOW SHE IS OFF AND 
PERHAPS COMING TO AN AISLE NEAR 
YOU 
NOW LET'S GO OVER TOPEKA COCKROFT 
WHO WILL TELL US WHAT THE WEATHER 
IS DOING LET'S GO OVER TO PETER 
COCKROFT IT IS PRETTY GRIM HERE 
THIS EVENING THERE IS THIS COLD 
WIND BLOWING AND WE HAVE GOT SOME 
WIND AND RAIN AS WELL SO IT IS 
FEELING PRETTY RAW NOT A LOT IS 
GOING TO CHANGE THIS EVENING OR 
OVERNIGHT THAT WIND WILL CONTINUE 
TO BLOW L. SUPPOSE ONE THING IS 
THAT TEMPERATURES WILL HOLD UP 
FAIRLY WELL UNDER THE CLOUD BY THE 
END OF THE NIGHT I THINK WE WILL 
GET SOME MORE PERSISTENT RAIN 
TURNING UP ACROSS COUNTIES TO THE 
SOUTH OF LONDON THAT RAIN WILL BE 
IMPORTANT TOMORROW BECAUSE IT WILL 
BE WORKING ITS WAY VERY SLOWLY 
FURTHER AND FURTHER NORTHWARDS 
ACROSS THE LONDON AREA IT WILL 
TAKE ITS TIME DOING THAT DURING 
TOMORROW ALL THE WHILE I THINK 
THE RAIN WILL BE BREAKING UP AND IT 
WILL BE TURNING LIKE AND PATCHY IF 
YOU WERE GOING TO SOMEWHERE LIKE 
VICARAGE ROAD YOU WANT TO BE 
WEARING YOUR WATERPROOFS ON SUNDAY 
THERE IS THE CHANCE OF A BIT OF 
BRIGHTNESS BREAKING THROUGH A 
LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE AND 
TEMPERATURES GETTING BACK INTO 
DOUBLE FIGURES INCIDENTALLY IF 
YOU'RE A CRICKET FAN DON'T FORGET 
WE HAVE GOT CRICKET COMMENTARY FOR 
YOU ON THE WEBSITE FOR ALL OF US 
ON SUNDAY IT IS GOING TO BE A 
SHOWERY DAY NEXT WEEK WITH ANY 
LUCK WE SHOULD GET SOME DRIER 
BRIGHTER WARMER WEATHER BUT 
BEFORE THAT ARRIVES AS FAR AS THE 
OUTLOOK IS CONCERNED THE SHORT 
TERM OUTLOOK 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW A LOOK AT 
THE MAIN HEADLINES A MAN AND TWO 
TEENAGERS HAVE BEEN SENTENCED TO A 
TOTAL OF FIFTY NINE YEARS FOR MURDERING A 
BUILDER WHO DISTURBED THEM WHILE 
THEY WERE BURGLING HIS FOAM 
BURBLING HIS HOME IN KENT THEY 
VICIOUSLY ATTACKED MARK WITHERALL 
AFTER HE CHASED THEM THE CITY IS 
PREPARING FOR WIDESPREAD JOB LOSSES 
AS THE SLUMP BITES IN LONDON 
ANALYSTS PREDICT WORSE IS TO COME 
AS WE HAVE HEARD SCORES OF 
INCREASINGLY FRAIL THALIDOMIDE 
VICTIMS ARE FACING AN UNCERTAIN 
FUTURE BECAUSE DWINDLING 
COMPENSATION PAYMENTS COULD FAIL TO 
MEET THEIR NEEDS THAT'S ALL FOR 
NOW BYE BYE
