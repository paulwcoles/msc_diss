THAT WAS ABOUT THE TWENTY SECOND MAY AND 
THEN GRADUALLY FROM THEN ON YOU

DOWN THE SKATE PARK AND AFTER THEN 
SHE WOULD GO AWAY FOR A COUPLE OF 
DAYS DAYS YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS AND

AMAZINGLY 
THAT FRIEND DID NOT AMAZINGLY REALISE SHE HAD RUN AWAY AND WAS

HALF AND HE DIDN'T OFFER ANY EXCUSE 
AND SAID WE'LL CATCH UP FOR

STEP AHEAD OF EVERYONE SEARCHING

OFFICERS OFFICERS IT IS A WEEK LATER AND DANIELLE IS

EVERYTHING I NEED IS HERE REALLY 
THERE IS NOTHING MORE EXCITING OUT 
THERE THAN WHAT IS HERE 
CHEERS EVERYBODY CHEERS 
DANIELLE'S DAD TERRY AND STEP MUM 
JO JOIN US NOW 
HOW DID YOU COPE 
WELL IT WAS VERY 
DIFFICULT OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T KNOW 
WHERE SHE WAS TO START WITH BUT 
EVENTUALLY WITH THE HELP FROM THE 
POLICE AND MISSING PEOPLE YOU KNOW 
WE TRACKED HER AROUND SO OBVIOUSLY 
THAT GAVE US A LOT OF GOOD FEELINGS 
SHE ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE ONE STEP 
AHEAD OF THE POLICE DID THAT MAKE 
IT HARDER FOR YOU 
ACTUALLY IT WAS 
HARD BUT I THINK IT HELPED WE HAD 
POSITIVE SIGHTINGS OF HER WE KNEW 
SHE WAS O. K. SHE WAS WELL DRESSED 
AND FED WE KNEW SHE WAS SAFE 
ALTHOUGH SHE WASN'T AT HOME WITH US 
YOU DID YOUR OWN SEARCHES YES YES ESPECIALLY LOCALLY BUT WE WENT TO 
LONDON A FEW TIMES AND HAD A LOOK 
AROUND AROUND IT IS A BIG PLACE AND THERE IS SO 
MANY PEOPLE 
SHE WAS GONE FOR SIX MONTHS WHERE 
WAS SHE DURING THE SIX MONTHS FOR FOR HALF THE TIME SHE WAS IN LONDON 
WHERE SHE ORIGINALLY WENT AND FOR 
THE LATTER PART SHE WAS IN MARGATE 
WHAT LED TO HER GOING 
WELL SHE 
DID RECEIVE THAT LETTER FROM SOCIAL 
SERVICES WHICH HAD NEGATIVES IN 
WHICH SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED ABOUT 
BUT IT IS HARD TO TELL SHE WAS 
GROWING UP AND REBELLING AND ALL 
THAT THAT WHAT ADVICE JO WOULD YOU GIVE TO 
OTHER PARENTS WHO ARE IN SIMILAR SITUATION SITUATION THE HARDEST PART IS TALKING I 
THINK IT IS VERY EASY TO NOT 
LISTEN TO WHAT TEENAGERS ARE SAYING 
TO YOU AND SOMETIMES THEY SAY 
THINGS 
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IF SIT DOWN 
AND TALK TO THEM AND LISTEN TO THEM AND EXPLAIN YOUR 
SIDE OF THE STORY AS WELL IT HAS 
REALLY HELPED NOW THAT SHE IS HOME 
WHAT IS SHE LIKE HOW IS SHE DOING

AND SHE IS BACK AT SCHOOL ISN'T 
SHE HOW IS HER STUDYING DOING SHE SHE HAS HAD TO DO A LOT OF CATCH UP 
BUT IS DUE TO SIT SOME GCSES THIS 
SUMMER SUMMER WHEN DO THE ALARM BELLS GO OFF DO 
YOU THINK TERRY WHEN DO YOU THINK 
SHE HAS GONE MISSING COUPLE OF 
TIMES PERHAPS YOU SHOULD BE DOING 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
IT IS DIFFICULT 
FOR THE PARENTS BECAUSE WE TRIED 
DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES WHEN SHE WENT 
BEFORE TRYING TO BE LOUD AND 
AGGRESSIVE AND TRYING TO LET HER 
KNOW HOW DANGEROUS IT IS AND THEN 
BEING NICE AND NOTHING SEEMED TO 
WORK IT IS DEEP DOWN IN HER 
FEELINGS WHATEVER COMES OUT COMES 
OUT OUT SO THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW YES YES MUCH DIFFERENT SHE SEEMS MORE 
SETTLED IN HERSELF AND LIKE

SPIRING FILM MAKER FROM EDINBURGH 
AFTER SPENDING THREE YEARS IN PARIS 
HE BREAKS UP WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND 
AND RETURNS TO SCOTLAND 
ON THE TWENTY SIXTH NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX HIS 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS WORRY WHEN HE 
DOESN'T COME HOME 
WE TRIED THE TWO OR THREE OTHER 
FRIENDS WE KNEW IN EDINBURGH THAT 
HE MIGHT BE WITH AND HE WASN'T 
WITH ANY OF THEM 
AND SO IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR 
FORTY EIGHT HOURS WE CONTACTED THE POLICE 
THE POLICE TRIED TO RETRACE ALAN'S 
MOVEMENTS BY TRACKS HIS MOBILE 
PHONE THEY PINPOINT THE LOCATION 
HE MAKES A CALL FROM ON THE DAY HE 
GOES MISSING 
THE THE POLICE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE 
SHOWN THAT ALAN WAS THE CRAG'S BAR 
AROUND TWO THIRTY P. M. THE INQUIRY HASN'T 
SHOWN ANY REASON WHY HE WAS THERE 
BUT WE KNOW HE WAS IN THAT BAR 
AND THAT IS A LAST KNOWN POSITION 
WE CAN HAVE OF HIM 
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE ALAN GOES WHEN 
HE LEAVES THE BAR THAT DAY 
BUT IN THE FOLLOWING MONTHS THERE 
ARE NUMBER OF UNCONFIRMED 
SIGHTINGS REPORTED ACROSS SCOTLAND 
THERE SEEMED ALL KINDS OF POSSIBLE 
LEADS AND THEN THERE WAS LITTLE 
FLURRY OF ACTIVITY IN ABERDEEN WHEN 
TWO PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY SAW HIM AND 
AND THERE WAS BIG FLURRY 
IN APRIL IN EDINBURGH WHEN ABOUT SIX PEOPLE 
THOUGHT THEY HAD SEEN HIM AND TWO 
OF THEM KNEW HIM TWO OF THEM 
WORKED WITH HIM 
OF ALL THE POSSIBLE SIGHTINGS IT 
IS THIS ONE FIVE MONTHS AFTER ALAN 
DISAPPEARS WHICH SEEMS THE MOST 
CREDIBLE CREDIBLE STAFF AT THE HALO BAR IN EDINBURGH 
HAD LOOKED OUT THROUGH THE GLASS 
FRONTED WINDOW AND SAW MALE 
STANDING OUTSIDE ON THE PAVEMENT 
AND ONE OF THE BARMAIDS THOUGHT IT 
WAS ALAN HER AND THE BAR MANAGER 
RAN OUTSIDE AND HAD LOOK AND BY 
THIS TIME THE FIGURE HAD STARTED TO 
WALK AWAY AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY 
DIDN'T CALL ON HIM OR SHOUT HIS 
NAME AND THEY WERE FAIRLY CONVINCED 
THAT IT COULD BE ALAN HOWEVER 
AGAIN THAT'S UNCONFIRMED AND WE 
HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO TRACE THAT 
PERSON PERSON SINCE APRIL TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THERE HAVE BEEN 
NO MORE SIGHTINGS REPORTED 
IT IS NOW EIGHTEEN MONTHS SINCE ALAN

THINK THERE IS JUST EVEN WHEN HE 
WAS ANNOYING

ENDEARING ENDEARING HE PROBABLY KNEW HOW MUCH IT MEANT 
TO OTHER PEOPLE TO HAVE HIM AROUND
