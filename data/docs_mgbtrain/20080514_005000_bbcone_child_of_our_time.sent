CHILD OF OUR TIME IS THE JOURNEY OF A LIFETIME 
WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ALL THESE CHILDREN 
SINCE THEY WERE BORN EIGHT YEARS AGO 
AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO SO UNTIL THEY'RE TWENTY 
TO FIND OUT WHAT MAKES US WHO WE ARE 
GENDER WHAT DOES IT MEAN TODAY 
I WAS TOMBOY AND SHE'S A GIRLY GIRL 
HOW DOES CELEBRITY CULTURE AFFECT GIRLS 
I JUST DON'T LIKE MY BODY SHAPE 
I THINK I LOOK REALLY FAT 
NOBODY REALLY LIKES FAT PEOPLE 
WHAT DO BOYS THINK OF THE OPPOSITE SEX 
HOW MANY GIRLFRIENDS DO YOU HAVE FOUR 
AND I USED TO HAVE TWELVE 
WHY DO THEY UNDERACHIEVE 
WHICH ONE IS THAT 
CLEVER CLEVER IS GONE WHY HAS CLEVER GONE 
BECAUSE CLEVER IS SO BORING 
AND ARE GIRLS GROWING UP TOO FAST 
WOULD YOU EVER WEAR A SKIRT THAT'S THAT SHORT NOPE 
THE TEMPTATION OF SEEING A GIRL'S KNICKERS IS TOO HARD FOR A BOY TO RESIST 
TONIGHT 
HELENA RHIANNA MEGAN TYRESE AND NATHAN 
HOW DO THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE ROLES OF THE SEXES IN A SOCIETY WHERE IT SEEMS THAT ANYTHING GOES 
WHEN I WAS A BOY IT WAS CLEAR HOW MEN AND WOMEN WERE EXPECTED TO BEHAVE 
MEN WERE THE BREADWINNERS 
AND WOMEN WERE LEFT TO DO ALL THE WORK IN THE HOME 
NOW WE LIKE TO THINK WE'RE BRIDGING THE DIVIDE OF THE SEXES 
BUT IN A CULTURE DOMINATED BY SEX CELEBRITY AND THE MEDIA 
ARE OUR CHILDREN BEING PERSUADED TO OPEN UP THE GAP AGAIN 
WE DID A TEST TO EXAMINE THE POWER OF MARKETING 
WE FILLED TWO SETS OF BOTTLES WITH EXACTLY THE SAME LEMONADE 
BUT WE PACKAGED ONE AS ROCKET POP WITH BLUE LABELS 
AND THE OTHER AS PRINCESS POP AND GAVE THEM PINK LABELS 
FIRST WE ASKED THE CHILDREN WHICH THEY LIKED THE LOOK OF 
ROCKET POP ROCKET POP ROCKET POP 
PRINCESS POP PRINCESS POP 
PROBABLY THE PRINCESS ONE BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY AIMED AT GIRLS RATHER THAN BOYS 
THEY ALL CHOSE THE ONE AIMED AT THEIR GENDER 
BUT SURELY THEY WON'T BE FOOLED BY THE PACKAGING AND THINK THAT THE TWO IDENTICAL DRINKS TASTE DIFFERENT 
UGH SO WHICH ONE DID THEY PREFER 
TEN OUT OF TEN 
SEVEN OUT OF TEN 
THAT ONE THAT ONE 
WHY DO YOU LIKE THAT ONE 
COS THAT ONE'S A BIT MORE DARK AND I DON'T LIKE IT 
COS THAT HAS MORE FIZZ 
BECAUSE IT'S MORE FLAT 
IT'S GOT MORE FLAVOUR IN IT 
THIS HAS LEAST AMOUNT OF WATER PUT 
THE LESS WATER YOU PUT IN THE MORE TASTIER IT TASTES 
BECAUSE I'VE MADE MY OWN HOME MADE LEMONADE BEFORE 
I DISCOVERED THAT IN A RECIPE BOOK 
AMAZINGLY ALL OUR CHILDREN BELIEVE THE DRINK MARKETED AT THEM TASTED BETTER 
WELL ALMOST ALL 
AFTER SOME VERY THOROUGH RESEARCH 
AH 
TYRESE BUSTED US 
THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME 
IT SEEMS CONSUMER CULTURE OFTEN THRIVES 
WHEN IT REINFORCES STEREOTYPES 
BUT SOME PARENTS ARE WORKING HARD TO REDRESS THE BALANCE 
THIS IS NATHAN 
NATHAN PRICE AND HIS BIG SISTER JOY 
ARE GROWING UP IN RURAL SCOTLAND WITH THEIR PARENTS RUTH AND RICHARD 
SECONDS AWAY ROUND THREE 
FROM THE VERY START THEY REJECTED TRADITIONAL GENDER ROLES 
AT THE MOMENT IT'S RUTH WHO GOES OUT TO WORK LEAVING BEFORE DAWN FOR THE EARLY SHIFT 
IT'S IMPORTANT AS A MOTHER 
AS A ROLE MODEL TO LET JOY AND NATHAN KNOW THAT WOMEN CAN GET OUT THERE AND WORK 
NATH NATHAN I'M GOING TO MAKE YOUR PACKED LUNCHES DON'T BE TOO LONG 
RICHARD STAYS AT HOME AND DOES MOST OF THE CHILDCARE 
RIGHT PUT YOUR HAND ON THE SPOON FEEL IT 
THAT LOOKS LOVELY THAT LOOKS NICER THAN MINE 
A BOY AND A GIRL IN MY HOUSEHOLD ARE EXACTLY THE SAME 
BOTH HAVE THE SAME CHORES TO DO THE SKILLS THAT THEY'RE LEARNING ARE THE SAME 
AND THEY SHOULD SHARE THEIR TOYS AS WELL 
BOYS PLAY WITH DOLLS 
YEAH 
COS I'VE GOT A DOLL 
RUTH AND RICHARD GOT MARRIED FOURTEEN YEARS AGO 
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP HAS BROKEN DOWN JUST LIKE NEARLY HALF OF ALL COUPLES 
BUT THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING UNUSUAL 
RUTH AND I LEAD QUITE SEPARATE LIVES ALTHOUGH WE CO PARENT 
AND WE DO EVERYTHING ELSE TOGETHER WE SHARE A HOUSE WE HAVE SEPARATE AREAS IN THAT HOUSE 
RUTH AND RICHARD ARE OPEN WITH THE CHILDREN ABOUT THEIR SEPARATE LIVES 
THAT'S MY MUM'S ROOM 
SHE LIKES CRYSTALS 
AND THAT'S MY DAD'S ROOM 
HE LIKES COMPUTERS AND PAINTING AND HE LIKES SCULPTING 
MUM LIKES PURPLE AND DAD LIKES RED 
I COME TO BED AT NIGHT AND I SLEEP IN THIS BED 
RICHARD GOES TO BED EITHER ON HIS OWN 
OR NOT ON HIS OWN IN HIS BED 
SINCE RUTH AND I HAVE BEEN LIVING SEPARATELY 
I'VE HAD ANOTHER PARTNER WHO THINGS DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT WITH 
UM 
AND THE PARTNERSHIP IS NOW DISSOLVED 
JOY 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER IF WE'D SEPARATED 
BUT I WOULD HATE THE KIDS TO HAVE TO CHOOSE 
WHICH ONE TO GO AND LIVE WITH 
I'M REALLY NOT UP FOR THAT EVEN NOW I'M NOT AN OPTION 
CAN I HELP YOU POT THEM ALL IN YEAH 
I KNOW THERE ARE MEN WHO WOULD HAVE WALKED AWAY FROM THE RELATIONSHIP AND FROM THEIR CHILDREN AS WELL 
I COULDN'T DREAM OF DOING IT BECAUSE THE LOVE I HAVE 
FOR MY CHILDREN IS TOO STRONG 
AND THE RESPONSIBILITY I FEEL TOWARDS MY CHILDREN IS TOO BIG UM 
JUST TO WALK AWAY FROM IT 
DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR FAMILY IS THE SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE'S OR DIFFERENT 
I THINK EVERYONE ELSE IS DIFFERENT DO YOU LIKE BEING DIFFERENT OR WOULD YOU RATHER BE THE SAME 
I PROBABLY LIKE BEING DIFFERENT 
NATHAN'S PARENTS MEET ONCE A WEEK FOR A DIARY MEETING 
THREE POINT FOUR FIVE ELEVENTH SLEEPOVER 
YEAH EIGHTH I'VE GOT THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
GOT FOUR O'CLOCK HERE JOY'S EYE TEST 
AYE ON THE THIRTIETH YEAH THAT'S STILL THERE THAT'S THE CARD FOR IT 
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO THAT ONE 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT TO DO THAT FINE 
SO YOU'D TAKE NATHAN WITH YOU AYE 
WHERE IS YOUR SCHOOL JACKET 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW DID YOU LEAVE IT AT SCHOOL NO 
LOVE YOU DADDY LOVE YOU TOO 
HAVE A GOOD DAY REMEMBER YOUR MANNERS 
WITH MORE MEN LOOKING AFTER CHILDREN AND WOMEN WORKING HAS THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN THE SEXES SHIFTED 
HISTORICALLY THE FATHER WAS CONSIDERED THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY 
SO WHO'S IN CHARGE NOW 
SOMETIMES MY MUM AND SOMETIMES MY DAD 
BOTH 
PROBABLY BOTH 
A SHARED ROLE WAS THE FAVOURITE DADS BARELY GOT A MENTION 
BUT THE SURPRISE RESULT WAS MUMMY MUMMY MUMMY 
MUM BECAUSE SHE DOES ALL THE WORK 
PROBABLY MY MUM MY DAD DOES NOTHING IN THE HOUSE 
HE GOES OUT TO THE PUB A LOT OF THE TIME SPENDING HIS MONEY THAT HE HAS EARNED ON BEER 
SO ARE WOMEN REALLY TAKING CHARGE 
THIS IS RHIANNA 
WHOO HOO 
SHE'S AN ONLY CHILD GROWING UP IN YORKSHIRE WITH HER MUM TANYA 
DOG RED DAD ANDY 
AND SIXTEEN BRATZ DOLLS 
I USED TO HAVE HAIR AS LONG AS HER 
DID YOU YEAH SO WHEN DID YOU HAVE IT CUT 
TWO THOUSAND SIX JULY TWENTY FIFTH OR SOMETHING 
GENDER ROLES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BONE OF CONTENTION IN THIS FAMILY 
TANYA IS ONE OF THE GROWING NUMBER OF WOMEN WHOSE JOB BRINGS IN THE HIGHER INCOME 
BEFORE RHIANNA WAS BORN THE COUPLE DECIDED SHE SHOULD BE THE ONE TO GO TO WORK 
WANT TO COME OUT NOW 
BUT ANDY DIDN'T TAKE TO CHILDCARE QUITE AS PLANNED 
OH POPPET 
COME ON JUMP UP 
OH 
SO TANYA TOOK ON BOTH ROLES 
DOING MOST OF THE CHILDCARE AND WORKING PART TIME 
TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY FINANCIALLY 
I PAY FOR EVERYTHING 
EVERYTHING'S IN MY NAME AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN BECAUSE WHEN ANDY MOVED INTO MY HOUSE 
MY LAST HOUSE IT WAS MY HOUSE ALL THE BILLS WERE IN MY NAME AND WE KEPT IT THAT WAY 
AND BECAUSE I'M THE ONE WHO WORRIES IF THINGS AREN'T PAID 
IT WAS JUST MORE SENSIBLE FOR ME TO HAVE THE CONTROL 
ANDY NOW RUNS A SMALL BUSINESS MAKING SIGNS 
BUT IT DOESN'T EARN MUCH 
AND THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM 
A LOT OF THE TIME DADDY'S NOT HERE 
ABOUT TEN PER CENT HE'S HERE NINETY PER CENT HE'S NOT 
IT'S NOT GOOD BECAUSE HE'S NOT SPENDING TIME WITH HIS FAMILY 
HE GOES TO HIS OTHER OFFICE STRAIGHT AFTER WORK 
WHERE HE DOES HIS WHEELING AND DEALING 
AND NETWORKING WITH HIS OTHER MATES WHO ALSO DRINK ALCOHOL 
SO WHAT'S HIS OTHER OFFICE 
ANY PUB THAT'S OPEN 
SO RHIANNA IS GROWING UP IN A FEMALE HOUSEHOLD 
I DON'T THINK DADDY'S COMING HOME FOR TEA TONIGHT 
HE NEVER COMES HOME 
STOP IT WHAT'S THE MATTER RHIANNA 
I ELBOWED MYSELF 
IF RHIANNA MARRIES SOMEBODY LIKE ANDY I WOULD BE FURIOUS 
I REALLY WOULD 
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY SOMEBODY IT SHOULD BE AN EQUAL PARTNERSHIP 
WHEN IT ALL GETS TOO MUCH RHIANNA TAKES REFUGE IN HER BRATZ DOLLS 
I DO TAKE MY TIME DRESSING MY BRATZ BECAUSE ALL THE CLOTHING ARE REALLY GOOD 
AND I TAKE A LONG TIME TRYING TO FIND THEM OUT 
BUT THE DOLLS BRING THEIR OWN PRESSURES 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO WEAR CLOTHES LIKE THAT YEAH 
BUT I WOULDN'T FIT INTO THEM PROPERLY 
THE CLOTHES THAT WE WEAR NOW THEY THINK EVERYBODY'S SO SMALL AND MIDGEY 
AND WILL FIT INTO THINGS THAT WILL FIT A BABY 
LIKE MANY ADULT WOMEN RHIANNA IS WORRIED ABOUT THE WAY SHE LOOKS 
I JUST DON'T LIKE MY BODY SHAPE BECAUSE I THINK I LOOK REALLY FAT 
AND I JUST DON'T LIKE IT 
SHE'S COMING HOME AND SAYING I'M LARDY I'M FAT 
BECAUSE SHE'S BIGGER BUILT THAN SOME OF THE CHILDREN 
SOMETIMES I JUST HATE MY LIFE COMPLETELY 
WHEN YOU HATE IT WHAT DO YOU HATE ABOUT IT 
I JUST HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT WHEN I HATE IT 
EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WHEN I HATE IT 
RHIANNA SWEETHEART 
WILL YOU SIT UP AND EAT PLEASE 
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A PENCIL 
DON'T WANT THE DOG EATING IT 
O. K. 
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE FOOD INTO A BATTLE BECAUSE MY SISTER WAS BORDERLINE ANOREXIC 
AND SHE GOT REALLY BAD WITH FOOD REALLY BAD 
I MEAN SHE WAS DOWN TO ABOUT SIX STONE 
I DON'T WANT RHIANNA TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT SORT OF MENTAL THING 
SO WHY IS RHIANNA WORRYING ABOUT HER BODY SHAPE WHEN SHE'S ONLY SEVEN 
FOR ADULT WOMEN WEIGHT AND DIETING IS A MODERN OBSESSION 
FUELLED BY A CELEBRITY CULTURE IN WHICH THINNER IS BETTER 
THESE MAGAZINES ARE A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEM 
CELLULITE 
STRAIGHT AWAY THIS OBSESSION WITH FEMALE SHAPE 
STARS LOSE WEIGHT 
WITH LESS THAN PERFECT BODIES BEING RIDICULED IN THE MEDIA 
CAN OUR SEVEN YEAR OLDS WITHSTAND THE PRESSURE TO BE THIN 
WE WANTED TO FIND OUT SO WE SHOWED OUR CHILDREN FIGURES 
RANGING FROM A WHICH IS UNDERWEIGHT TO G. WHICH IS OVERWEIGHT 
WE ASKED THEM WHICH FIGURE THEY THOUGHT THEY LOOKED LIKE AND THEN WHICH ONE THEY'D MOST LIKE TO BE 
FIRST OF ALL I DON'T WEAR BIKINIS LIKE THAT 
I WANT YOU TO PICK OUT THE ONE WHICH IS MOST LIKE YOU 
I'D BE OFF THE PAGE 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'D BE OFF THE PAGE 
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO LOOK LIKE 
RHIANNA CHOSE A HEALTHY FIGURE IRONICALLY NOT UNLIKE HER OWN 
SHOWING HOW EASY IT IS TO LOSE PERSPECTIVE EVEN FOR CHILDREN 
SO WHICH OF THESE BODY SHAPES IS MOST LIKE YOURS 
WHY DID YOU PICK THAT ONE 
BECAUSE IT'S GOT 
IT'S GOT THE SAME SIZED TUMMY AND I WOULD RATHER BE THINNER 
BUT NOT NEARLY AS THIN AS SOME OF THE OTHERS 
I'D SAY I LOOK LIKE B. BUT I'D RATHER LOOK LIKE A 
PICK THE CHILD WHO HAS THE BODY THAT YOU WOULD MOST LIKE FOR YOURSELF 
WHAT'S BETTER ABOUT A 
IT'S THINNER A. 
THE GIRL THAT IS SKINNY 
A IS A BIT MORE A IS A TINY BIT MORE THINNER 
A WORRYING NUMBER OF THE GIRLS ASPIRED TO BEING UNDERWEIGHT BUT WHY 
THERE'S ONE ISSUE WE RAISED THAT SEEMS TO EXPLAIN IT 
WHO WOULD HAVE THE MOST FRIENDS 
WHO WOULD HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF FRIENDS 
G. 
BECAUSE SHE'S FAT 
SHE'S BIGGER 
SHE'S LIKE FAT AND I'M REALLY REALLY FAT 
MANY OF THE GIRLS EQUATED FATNESS WITH UNPOPULARITY 
AND SOME WENT EVEN FURTHER 
I THINK SHE MIGHT BE QUITE NASTY 
WHY'S THAT 
BECAUSE SHE'S QUITE FAT AND SHE WILL BE NASTY 
NO WONDER GIRLS ARE FRIGHTENED OF BEING LABELLED FAT 
SO ARE OUR SEVEN YEAR OLD BOYS AS BODY CONSCIOUS 
WHICH BODY WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO HAVE 
WHY DID YOU PICK THAT ONE AGAIN 
I DON'T KNOW 
MOST OF THEM HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR BODY IMAGE AND SHOWED LITTLE INTEREST IN DOING SO 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE THAT ONE 
UM BECAUSE I WANT TO BE REALLY FAT 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE FAT 
SO I CAN BASH PEOPLE OVER 
WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK WOULD HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF FRIENDS THAT ONE 
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S A SHOW OFF 
WHEN IT COMES TO ANXIETY ABOUT THEIR BODY IT SEEMS THAT AT SEVEN 
THE BOYS AND GIRLS ARE SHOWING MARKED DIFFERENCES 
THEY MAY FEEL LESS PRESSURE TO BE THIN BUT DO BOYS GET A RAW DEAL IN OTHER WAYS 
THIS IS TYRESE 
WOW 
HE'S GROWING UP IN BIRMINGHAM SPLITTING HIS TIME EQUALLY 
BETWEEN THE HOMES OF HIS MUM MARIE AND HIS DAD JIMAL 
BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE THEY ALREADY HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND JIMAL WAS HOPING FOR A BOY 
IF I HAD A BOY I THINK THE WAY I PLAY WITH THE KIDS WOULD CHANGE SLIGHTLY 
I'D PROBABLY DO MORE BOY THINGS THAN MORE GIRLY THINGS I SUPPOSE 
LIKE FOOTBALL I MEAN I DO PLAY WITH THEM WITH THE FOOTBALL 
BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME I DON'T THINK IT'S THE SAME PERSONALLY 
HE WANTS TO GET ROUGH AND RAGGED THAT'S IT 
BUT MARIE THOUGHT THAT BOYS WERE AT SUCH A DISADVANTAGE IN SOCIETY SHE DIDN'T WANT A SON 
THEY CAN GET INTO CRIME AND GETTING GIRLS PREGNANT AND YOU KNOW 
HARASSMENT AND FIGHTING AND END UP IN PRISON AND COURT AND I'M LIKE OH NO 
MARIE'S WORRIES WERE NOT WITHOUT A BASIS 
BOYS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE INVOLVED IN VIOLENCE 
AND AT SCHOOL THEY LAG BEHIND GIRLS IN ALMOST EVERY SUBJECT 
AND BLACK BOYS FARE EVEN WORSE 
BUT WHEN TYRESE WAS BORN FEARS WERE PUT TO ONE SIDE 
THIS IS THE BEST BIT WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON YOUR CHEST AND YOU JUST LIE DOWN 
SO HAS SHE REVISED HER GLOOMY PREDICTION 
NOW SEVEN YEARS ON I'M STILL WORRIED PROBABLY EVEN MORE SO 
BECAUSE TYRESE IS GROWING UP TO BE QUITE AGGRESSIVE 
I'M GOING TO BREAK THIS DOOR OFF AND MAKE IT FALL 
GET OFF ME 
LIKE MANY BOYS OF HIS AGE 
TYRESE HAS ALWAYS FOUND THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT CONSTRICTING 
AND HAS STRUGGLED WITH HIS WORK AT SCHOOL WHICH AFFECTS HIS BEHAVIOUR 
I'M GOING TO PUT THIS IN YOUR EYE 
TELL US ABOUT SCHOOL DO YOU LIKE IT 
NO I DON'T LIKE IT IT'S BORING 
WHY 
BECAUSE ALL THE TEACHERS ARE BORING 
I WANT YOU TO READ DOWN THESE WORDS AND RECENT TESTS INDICATE HE'S DYSLEXIC 
WILL YOU HAVE A GO AT THOSE FOR ME FROG SEA KING 
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE CAN YOU READ THAT ONE 
THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT HE'S HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH 
SO I WOULD HAVE SAID HE DOES NEED SOME SUPPORT 
O. K. 
MARIE WORRIES THAT DOING BADLY AT SCHOOL MIGHT SEND TYRESE DOWN A MORE SINISTER PATH 
THERE'S A LOT MORE GANGS ABOUT THERE'S A LOT MORE YOUNG MEN JOINING DIFFERENT GANGS 
BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT BELONGING 
BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT BEING WANTED AND THESE GANGS GIVE THEM THAT 
IT'S SCARY IT'S REALLY SCARY 
SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT OF LATE IS NIGGA 
LIKE MY NIGGA YOU KNOW 
YOU SIT DOWN AND YOU EXPLAIN TO HIM WHERE THE WORD COMES FROM 
WHY THE WORD IS NOT A GOOD WORD YES IT'S IN LOTS OF VIDEOS 
AND YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENT WAYS BUT HE'S ONLY SEVEN 
IT COULD BE LIKE I'M STEREOTYPING MY OWN KID AND MY OWN SELF 
HE MAY NOT WANT TO DO THAT HE MAY SAY OH MOTHER I WANT TO GO TO SCOUTS 
AND I WANT TO BUILD WANT TO GO CAMPING 
I WANT TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS 
IT WILL PROBABLY BE MORE THE GANG ROUTE WHICH IS WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO AS A MOTHER TO STOP THAT 
AND GEAR HIM TO ANOTHER DIRECTION BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T WANT TO GEAR HIM 
TO A DIRECTION THAT HE'S HE MAY BE SAFE BUT IT MAY BE A BIT PONCY 
WITH CHILDREN GETTING MIXED MESSAGES ABOUT WHO THEY SHOULD BE WHAT DO THEY ASPIRE TO 
ARE BOYS' AND GIRLS' VALUES THE SAME OR DIFFERENT 
WE GAVE THEM A CHOICE OF SIX QUALITIES TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY VALUE MOST 
THERE TO HELP IS PSYCHOLOGIST N. ICOLA COSGRAVE 
SO WE'VE GOT SIX WORDS TYRESE 
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO PICK ONE WORD THAT YOU'RE GOING TO THROW AWAY 
WHICH ONE IS THAT 
CLEVER CLEVER HAS GONE WHY HAS CLEVER GONE 
BECAUSE CLEVER IS SO BORING 
CLEVER IS GOING IN THE BIN 
IS IT BETTER OR WORSE THAN RICH HEALTHY AND KIND 
WORSE 
ARE YOU GOING TO THROW IT AWAY YEAH 
O. K. 
THE BOYS SEEM TO FEEL THAT CLEVERNESS ISN'T COOL 
WHICH MAY BE ONE REASON WHY THEY'RE FALLING SO FAR BEHIND GIRLS AT SCHOOL 
CLEVER MEANS YOU'RE BRAINY AND YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO QUITE A LOT OF THE TIME 
IF YOU'RE CLEVER EVERYBODY LIKES YOU MORE 
BUT THE BOYS WERE ALL IN AGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT THEY DID VALUE 
I WANT TO BE RICH YOU WANT TO BE RICH WHY 
I JUST WANT TO BUY LOTS OF CHOCOLATE 
TELL ME WHY YOU DECIDED TO KEEP RICH 
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE A LOT OF MONEY 
BECAUSE I WILL BE ABLE TO GET ANYTHING I WANT TO GET 
ALMOST ALL OF THEM KEPT RICH AS THEIR FINAL CHOICE 
THE GIRLS SEEM TO VALUE VERY DIFFERENT THINGS 
WHICH ONE ARE YOU GOING TO THROW AWAY HET 
RICH PEOPLE GET A LOT OF MONEY 
BUT THEY ALSO DON'T HAVE MANY FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY BOAST A LOT 
EVERY GIRL THOUGHT KIND AND HEALTHY WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT QUALITIES 
IF I THREW HEALTHY AWAY THEN I'D BE FAT AND TRY AND BE KIND TO MY FRIENDS 
BUT THEY STILL WOULDN'T LIKE ME COS NOBODY REALLY LIKES FAT PEOPLE 
IT'S GOOD TO BE BOTH OF THESE THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT 
THE CHILDREN SPLIT NEATLY ALONG GENDER LINES 
REGARDLESS OF CLASS ETHNICITY OR FAMILY BACKGROUND 
DOINK 
THIS IS HELENA 
SHE'S A REAL GIRL'S GIRL 
O. K. I CAN'T HIT IT SO I'M GOING TO THROW IT TO YOU AND THEN YOU HIT IT OW 
HELENA LIVES IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE 
WHERE HER MUM JEANETTE RUNS THE FAMILY'S MULTI MILLION POUND BUSINESS 
AND HER DAD BARRY HAS RETIRED 
HELENA'S A HIGH ACHIEVING SEVEN YEAR OLD WITH A READING AGE OF NINE 
AND A YOUNGER SISTER SHE LIKES TO BOSS AROUND 
BYE BYE 
SHE'S SHUT THE DOOR 
I'M NOT LETTING YOU IN 
SHE NOT LETTING US IN 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE PASSWORD BUT HELENA 
OH YOU CAN'T DO THIS HELENA 
WHY NOT 
THIS IS MY BEDROOM 
IT'S HER BEDROOM 
BUT LIFE HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN SUCH FUN 
HELENA IS THE SOLE SURVIVOR OF TRIPLETS 
BORN MORE THAN FOUR MONTHS PREMATURELY 
HER BROTHER BARRY AND SISTER MILLIE DIED SOON AFTER BIRTH 
BUT TINY HELENA WAS A FIGHTER AND AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS IN HOSPITAL SHE WAS ALLOWED HOME 
SHE'S HAVING A GOOD LOOK ROUND 
STATISTICALLY PREMATURE BABY GIRLS HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SURVIVAL THAN BOYS 
SO BEING BORN A GIRL COULD HAVE BEEN AN ADVANTAGE 
AND EVER SINCE THEN SHE'S ALWAYS EMBRACED HER FEMININITY 
I'M IN A CLOUD OF BUBBLES THIS FAIRY IS 
TODAY SHE'S HAVING A MANICURE WITH HER MOTHER 
I'M GOING TO CHOOSE THAT ONE 
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE THE SHINY SILVER OVER THERE 
HELENA AND I LAST DID OUR NAILS A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO ON A CRUISE SHIP 
SO I THINK GIRLS ARE NEVER TOO YOUNG TO LEARN BEAUTY THERAPY YOU KNOW 
JEANETTE BELIEVES THAT LOOKING GOOD IS ONLY PART OF THE RECIPE FOR FEMALE SUCCESS 
I WAS INVOLVED IN POLITICS AT THE HEIGHT OF MAGGIE POWER 
FOR A YOUNG PERSON TO SEE A WOMAN AT THE HEAD OF THE COUNTRY WAS FANTASTIC YES 
IT SHOWED ME OPPORTUNITY WAS OUT THERE 
DO YOU HAVE ANY JEWELS FOR NAILS 
NO WE DON'T 
AND SHE'S GOT HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF HELENA 
FOR ME THE TRAGEDY OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE OTHER TWO 
IS NOW ABOUT MAKING THE MOST OF HELENA 
TEACHING HER ENOUGH SO THAT SHE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE AT WHATEVER SHE CHOOSES TO BE 
HELENA'S PICKING UP ON HER MOTHER'S AMBITIOUS NATURE 
I'D LIKE TO BE UM 
UM 
BARRY'S GOT EVEN BIGGER PLANS 
I RECKON SHE'LL BE ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE ON MARS 
BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S A GIRL DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T GO TO MARS 
THEY CAN STILL PUT THEIR LIPSTICK ON THEY CAN STILL PUT A CLASSY SPACE SUIT ON OR WHATEVER 
THAT'S MY HELENA 
TO GIVE HER THE BEST POSSIBLE START IN LIFE 
JEANETTE AND BARRY HAVE ENROLLED HELENA IN AN EXCLUSIVE PRIVATE SCHOOL 
RULES OF HOMEWORK 
SWITCH OFF TELEVISIONS 
WASH YOUR HANDS 
SIT AT A TABLE 
USE A SHARP PENCIL 
REMEMBER TO TAKE YOUR HOMEWORK BACK TO SCHOOL 
SORRY MY LEGS ARE TIRED 
YOUR LEGS ARE TIRED WHY ARE YOUR LEGS TIRED 
COS I HAD TO GET UP EARLY OH 
IN SPITE OF AN EIGHT HOUR SCHOOL DAY AND HOMEWORK ON TOP HELENA'S STILL KEEN TO LEARN 
SO THE VICTORIAN TIMES ANYONE SEE WHERE THEY MIGHT FIT IN 
ANYONE HAVE A GUESS HELENA WHAT DO RECKON 
AFTER THE GREAT FIRE OF LONDON 
YOU'RE RIGHT DO YOU WANT TO PUT THAT IN ORDER 
THERE YOU GO 
TODAY'S GIRLS ARE EXPECTED TO DO WELL AND THEY DO CONSISTENTLY 
HEY HEY EXCELLENT 
SO DO THE CHILD OF OUR TIME PARENTS STILL HAVE ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS 
WE USED TO MAKE ABOUT GENDER ROLES 
I BELIEVE THE MAN SHOULD BE THE MAIN BREAD WINNER IN THE FAMILY 
NOT NECESSARILY IF THE WOMAN HAS THE BETTER JOB 
WHY NOT 
I BELIEVE A MAN SHOULD BE THE MAIN BREAD WINNER IN A FAMILY 
PERSONALLY I THINK THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THING 
I BELIEVE THAT GIRLS SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH TOY TRUCKS 
I THINK THAT'S A TOTAL LOAD OR RUBBISH 
I BELIEVE GIRLS MUST PLAY WITH TOY TRUCKS THEY MUST 
I BELIEVE BOYS SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DOLLS NO I DISAGREE 
I DON'T THINK BOYS SHOULD PLAY WITH DOLLS I WAS NEVER A DOLL PLAYER EVEN THOUGH I HAD TWO SISTERS 
DAVY USED TO PLAY WITH BECAUSE I WAS WORKING AS A NANNY AND THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF GIRL THINGS 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MY SON DOING 
I WOULD HAVE UNDERLYING CONCERNS IF HE WAS PLAYING WITH DOLLS 
BUT THERE'S ONE AREA WHERE MOST AGREE THE MARCH TOWARDS EQUALITY HAS BEEN A LITTLE SLOWER 
I BELIEVE SOCIETY HAS REACHED A POINT WHERE WOMEN AND MEN HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ACHIEVEMENT 
I KIND OF AGREE WITH THAT BUT I STILL BELIEVE THAT 
WOMEN HAVE TO WORK TWICE AS HARD AS MEN TO BE RESPECTED HALF AS MUCH 
EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK 
I DO STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THAT'S STILL AN ISSUE 
MANY WOMEN ARE STILL PAID LESS THAN MEN SO I DISAGREE TOTALLY WITH THAT 
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION 
IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WOMEN HAVE SO MANY THINGS THAT INTERFERE WITH THE WORKING LIFE 
WORKING LIFE IS I WOULD SAY IS STILL STEREOTYPICALLY MALE BASED 
AND TANYA SHOULD KNOW SHE'S BEEN MADE REDUNDANT 
SHE GOT FIRED BY HER BOSS BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T WORK FULL TIME 
SO SHE'S NOW BEEN LOOKING FOR A JOB 
BUT IN HER SPARE TIME IT'S BEEN A LOT BETTER 
BECAUSE SHE HAS GOT TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH ME 
THE LITTLE BUFFER ZONE THAT I HAD WHICH WASN'T AN AWFUL LOT 
IS GETTING EATEN AWAY EACH TIME THE MORTGAGE COMES OUT 
BUT IT'LL BE RIGHT I'LL GET SOMETHING EVEN IF I DON'T GET A JOB THAT I REALLY WANT TO DO 
I'LL HAVE TO GET A JOB THAT PAYS SOME MONEY YOU KNOW THERE ARE JOBS OUT THERE 
I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY HOURS I'D HAVE TO WORK AT MINIMUM WAGE 
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY BUT YOU KNOW 
THEY'RE ALREADY RELYING ON FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE 
WE'VE BEEN LIVING ON COUNCIL MONEY AND I'M SCARED WHEN IT RUNS OUT 
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN IT RUNS OUT 
I'M JUST REALLY SCARED ABOUT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
RHIANNA'S BEEN ESCAPING INTO THE WORLD OF TELEVISION THIS SUMMER 
I LIKE WATCHING MUSIC VIDEOS AND MUSIC ESPECIALLY ONE BY RHIANNA UMBRELLA I LIKE THAT ONE 
YOU CAN STAND UNDER MY UMBRELLA 
YOU CAN STAND UNDER MY UMBRELLA 
I THINK ALL RHIANNA'S AND BEYONCE'S SINGLES ARE REALLY GOOD 
AND SHAKIRA AND BEYONCE ARE REALLY GOOD AS WELL AS RHIANNA 
QUITE A LOT OF THEM ARE GOOD BUT THOSE ARE MY FAVOURITE GIRL BANDS 
BUT TANYA SEES A DARKER SIDE 
THE MUSIC VIDEOS ARE JUST WELL THEY'RE SOFT PORN 
A LITTLE NAUGHTY 
WANNA GET DIRTY 
IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR MY ARRIVAL 
AND SHE LIKES A LOT OF THE HIP HOP STUFF 
THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF BUMP AND GRIND IN THAT 
YEAH WHEN WE WERE LITTLE 
THOSE THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN BEHIND THE COUNTER STUFF WOULDN'T THEY 
DO YOU THINK SOME OF THE WOMEN LIKE BEYONCE AND RHIANNA 
WOULD YOU SEE THEM AS ROLE MODELS FOR YOU 
ER YES SORT OF BUT I WOULDN'T BE EXACTLY LIKE THEM 
BUT TANYA'S NERVOUS ABOUT RHIANNA COPYING HER MUSIC IDOLS TOO CLOSELY 
SHE'S TALL SHE'S QUITE WELL FORMED FOR HER AGE SHE PUTS MAKE UP ON 
AND SHE LOOKS LIKE TEN OR ELEVEN BUT HER BRAIN'S NOT TEN OR ELEVEN 
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE FOR HOW PEOPLE WILL REACT TO HER 
YOU KNOW THE INAPPROPRIATE ATTENTION AND I REALLY DON'T WANT HER COPING WITH THAT YET 
SO ARE CHILDREN COPYING WHAT LOOKS GLAMOROUS ON TELEVISION 
WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE MORE ADULT MESSAGES BEHIND WHAT THEY SEE 
CLOTHES MATTER IN A SOCIETY OBSESSED BY IMAGE 
SO WE'VE SET UP OUR OWN CHILD OF OUR TIME BOUTIQUE TO SEE WHAT OUR CHILDREN WOULD LIKE TO WEAR 
ALL THESE CLOTHES ARE AVAILABLE FOR SEVEN YEAR OLDS ON THE HIGH STREET 
OUR SELECTION RANGED FROM URBAN STREET TO BLAZER AND TIE 
FOOTBALLER'S WIFE TO JEANS AND T. SHIRT 
SO WHAT WOULD OUR CHILDREN CHOOSE AND WHY 
TO FIND OUT IS DRAMA THERAPIST JOOLS RAWLINS 
HAVE YOU GOT ANY BRATZ STUFF 
OH WHAT CAN YOU FIND 
SO WHAT OTHER KIND OF CLOTHES WOULD A BRAT WEAR 
REALLY REALLY SHORT SKIRTS LIKE THAT 
WOULD THEY COVER THEIR BOTTOMS JUST ONLY JUST 
JUST LIKE THERE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT FASHION FOR SEVEN EIGHT YEAR OLDS 
SEVEN TO EIGHT YEAR OLD GIRLS ARE TRYING TO EMULATE THE POP STARS 
AS IN THE POP GROUPS THEY WILL COME OUT IN NEXT TO NOTHING OVER SEXUALISED YEAH 
IT'S ALL IT'S LOLITA ISH 
WOULD YOU EVER WEAR A SKIRT THAT WAS THAT SHORT 
NOPE WHY NOT 
THE TEMPTATION OF SEEING A GIRL'S KNICKERS IS TOO HARD FOR A BOY TO RESIST 
OH IS IT WHAT WOULD A BOY DO IF HE SAW A GIRL'S KNICKERS 
SCREAM SCREAM 
THREE TWO ONE 
HE'S WEARING A HOOD 
SO HE'S A HOODY ISN'T HE OOH 
THERE'S A DOLLAR SIGN 
THE BOYS ALL MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE GANGSTA LOOK WHETHER THEY CAME FROM THE INNER CITY 
OH WOW 
OR RURAL SCOTLAND WHAT A FANTASTIC NEW LOOK 
YOU ARE WALKING DIFFERENTLY WITH THAT OUTFIT ON AS WELL 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR CAP ON QUITE A JAUNTY ANGLE 
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO HAVE YOUR CAP LIKE THAT I DON'T KNOW 
DOES IT LOOK DIFFERENT LIKE THAT TO IF YOU'VE GOT IT LIKE THAT 
YEAH WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THAT HOW DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENT 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE IT LIKE THAT 
SO WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE GIRLS 
THREE TWO ONE 
OH HELENA YOUNG 
I THINK I'D KIND OF WEAR THIS TO A NIGHT CLUB 
TO A NIGHT CLUB 
DO DE DOO DO DO DO 
THE GIRLS WENT FOR AN ADULT LOOK WITH FISHNETS AND MINISKIRTS ALL IN PINK 
THE CLOTHES THEY CHOSE SUGGEST THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY FASHION AND CELEBRITY CULTURE 
GOING TO THE EXTREMES OF MASCULINITY AND FEMININITY 
WE WOULDN'T BE GOING OUT TO BUY THAT PARTICULAR OUTFIT 
THE TIGHTS TURN IT FROM SOMETHING QUITE INNOCENT INTO SOMETHING A BIT LESS INNOCENT 
WITH ALL THIS EXPOSURE TO ADULT SEXUALITY 
HOW KNOWING ARE OUR CHILDREN 
WE ASKED THEM ABOUT THE MOST SENSITIVE SUBJECT OF ALL SEX 
WHERE DO BABIES COME FROM 
MUMMY DONE 
MUMMY'S TUMMY 
LADIES 
I DON'T KNOW 
WELL THEY REALLY COME FROM MEN 
BUT BABIES 
THE MEN HAVE GOT A POUCH JUST BEHIND THEIR WILLIES YEAH 
HOW DOES IT GET IN THE MUMMY'S TUMMY 
DO YOU KNOW 
DO YOU 
THE MAN JUMPS ONTO THE WOMAN 
THE WINKY GOES INTO THE FOU FOU 
IT'S REALLY VERY RUDE 
THIS IS MEGAN 
CAN YOU FEEL ANY PIGLETS INSIDE HER 
IT'S NOT SURPRISING SHE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE FACTS OF LIFE THAN MOST SEVEN YEAR OLDS 
SHE'S GROWING UP ON A FARM IN WALES WITH MUM GAYNOR 
HOW MANY BABIES CAN YOU COUNT 
DAD RHODRI 
BROTHER DAVY SEAN 
AND SISTER DELANA 
MEGAN INHERITED HER PINK BEDROOM AND WARDROBE FROM HER ELDER SISTER 
I DON'T LIKE PINK BUT SHE CHOOSED IT 
I'M A TOMBOY IT'S ACTUALLY A GIRL BUT LIKES PLAYING WITH BOY'S STUFF 
AND WEARING BOY'S CLOTHES' 
MUM I FOUND TWO OF THESE 
SHE FEELS MORE AT HOME FINDING WORMS FOR BAIT THAN WORRYING ABOUT WHAT TO WEAR 
IT'S QUITE BORING CHOOSING CLOTHES ALL MORNING 
AND THEN YOU WASTE OUT ALL YOUR DAY AND MAYBE IT WAS A REALLY FUN DAY 
AND YOU WENT FISHING OR SOMETHING 
MEGAN'S TOMBOY NATURE CAME AS A BIT OF A SURPRISE TO HER PARENTS 
THEY DO THINGS THE TRADITIONAL WAY 
I DO ALL THE SORT OF COOKING I DO ALL THE CLEANING TIDYING UP 
AND RHODRI HE SORT OF DOESN'T DO MUCH IN THE HOUSE 
HE LEAVES THE HOUSE AT SEVEN HUNDRED A M. AND HE'S OUT UNTIL MAYBE EIGHT HUNDRED P. M. NINE HUNDRED P. M. IN THE SUMMER 
BUT HE DOESN'T HELP OUT WITH THE CHILDREN 
NO WE'RE PRETTY OLD FASHIONED 
NOW MEGAN IS HAVING TO FIND HER OWN TAKE ON GENDER ROLES 
SHE'S GOT A BOYFRIEND 
CLASSMATE RHYS 
IS RHYS JUST A FRIEND OR IS HE A BIT MORE THAN THAT 
BIT MORE THAN A FRIEND IS HE YOUR BOYFRIEND MMM 
HE LOOKS QUITE COOL NEARLY ALL THE GIRLS IN THE CLASS LOVE HIM EVEN KATHRYN LOVES HIM 
IS HE GOOD LOOKING YEAH 
WHAT'S HE LOOK HE'S GOT BROWN HAIR SOMETIMES HE SPIKES IT UP 
TONIGHT THEY'RE HAVING A SLEEPOVER AND RHYS IS GUEST OF HONOUR 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
CAN'T GET THROUGH 
AND TOMBOY MEG PROVES SHE'S NOT AVERSE TO A BIT OF CHIVALRY 
BY BEDTIME RHYS IS A HIT WITH ALL THE GIRLS AT THE PARTY 
RHYS IS SO SEXY 
IT'S LOVELY I THINK IT'S REALLY NICE 
HAVING A BOYFRIEND TO A SEVEN YEAR OLD 
ISN'T REALLY ALL ABOUT KISSING AND HOLDING HANDS AND ALL THIS 
IT'S JUST BEING FRIENDS YOU KNOW 
HE'S SHOWN HIS BUM TO EVERYONE 
THE WEIRD THING ABOUT ME AND RHYS 
I'M A TOMBOY AND RHYS IS A GIRLY GIRL 
THEY CAN'T GET UP TO MUCH AT SEVEN SURELY 
MIND YOU 
I HOPE 
ALL RIGHT 
LET'S HOPE THAT RHYS DOESN'T SNORE TOO MUCH GIRLS O. K. GOODNIGHT 
WHOO 
WHEE IT'S FUN 
OUR CHILDREN ARE COPYING ADULT BEHAVIOUR BUT ARE THEY GROWING UP MORE QUICKLY THAN THEIR PARENTS DID 
MY FIRST GIRLFRIEND WAS A GIRL IN SCHOOL 
I WAS FIFTEEN SIXTEEN 
I WOULD BE SIXTEEN 
I WENT OUT WITH THE SAME PERSON FROM TWELVE TO TWENTY ONE BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE DIDN'T 
I THINK I WAS FIFTEEN SIXTEEN I WAS 
TELL ME ABOUT HIM 
ERM 
I CAN'T BECAUSE IT WON'T BE NICE 
SO WHAT DO OUR SEVEN YEAR OLDS KNOW ABOUT ROMANCE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A GIRLFRIEND IS 
SOMEONE WHO YOU LOVE IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE 
A GIRLFRIEND YOU KISS A FRIEND YOU PLAY WITH 
BUT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY LOVE THEM VERY MUCH 
I'VE GOT A SORT OF BOYFRIEND CALLED FRANK AND MRS. MERCER SAID TO ME 
THAT WE SHOULD GET MARRIED AND BECOME BANKERS BECAUSE WE ARE BOTH REALLY REALLY GOOD WITH MONEY 
I'VE GOT MORE THAN ONE GIRLFRIEND 
HOW MANY GIRLFRIENDS DO YOU HAVE FOUR 
FOUR I USED TO HAVE TWELVE 
SO WHY IS NATHAN SO POPULAR WITH THE GIRLS 
WE ASKED HIM TO SIT THE VALUES TEST THAT DIVIDED THE BOYS AND GIRLS SO NEATLY 
ALL THE GIRLS CHOSE KIND AND HEALTHY 
AND ALL THE BOYS CHOSE RICH 
ALL THAT IS BUT ONE 
WHY DID YOU THROW AWAY RICH 
BECAUSE IT'S JUST MONEY 
WHAT WOULD NATHAN CHOOSE 
NATHAN VALUED KIND AND HEALTHY ABOVE ALL THE OTHERS 
THE SAME AS THE GIRLS 
HE WAS THE ONLY CHILD TO BUCK THE TREND 
SO IT SEEMS THAT THE LACK OF STEREOTYPES AT HOME HAS ALLOWED HIM TO DEVELOP HIS SENSITIVE SIDE 
AND RECENTLY IT'S BEEN AN EMOTIONAL TIME FOR HIM 
HIS GRANDMOTHER HAS DIED 
WHEN MY GRAN DIED 
I THINK LIKE 
MY HEART BROKE 
HOW DID THAT FEEL 
SAD 
DID YOU LOVE YOUR GRANNY VERY MUCH 
SHE CAME INTO THE HOUSE TO SLEEP OVER COS SHE WASN'T THAT WELL 
AND THEN SHE FELL OFF HER BED 
AND SHE COULDN'T GET UP FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT 
AND THEN IN HOSPITAL HER HEART STOPPED WORKING AND THEN 
SHE CAME ALIVE AGAIN THEN DIED AT NIGHT TIME 
NATHAN IS HAVING TO COME TO TERMS NOT ONLY WITH HIS OWN GRIEF BUT THAT OF HIS FATHER 
WE GOT TO SEE HER COFFIN 
I HIDED BEHIND MY DAD BECAUSE IT WAS SAD 
HOW DID IT MAKE YOU FEEL WHEN YOU SAW YOUR DADDY BEING SAD 
SAD 
IT'S BECAUSE I'VE HARDLY EVER SEEN MY DAD CRY 
THEY ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT DADS DON'T CRY 
SO THEY LEARNED A BIT OF A LESSON THERE 
IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT PEOPLE REALISED THAT TEARS AREN'T GENDER RELATED 
BUT ARE EMOTION RELATED 
SO HAS SOCIETY REACHED A POINT WHERE MEN ARE FREE TO DISPLAY EMOTION 
I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE EQUALLY ACCEPTABLE FOR MEN AND WOMEN TO CRY IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE 
YEP I ALWAYS CARRY TISSUES 
GAYNOR WILL TELL YOU SHE'S OFTEN SEEN ME WITH A TEAR IN MY EYE 
AND BEING QUITE PATHETIC AS SHE SAYS 
RHODRI AND ALL HIS FAMILY THEY ALL CRY IN WEDDINGS 
HE CRIED AT MY WEDDING MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE AHEAD WITH IT 
IF YOU WANT TO CRY CRY IT SHOULDN'T MAKE YOU LESS OR A MAN OR LESS OF A WOMAN 
I RESPECT SOMEONE FOR CRYING BUT THERE'S CRYING AND CRYING DON'T GO ON LIKE A BIG GIRL'S BLOUSE 
GROWING UP IN INNER CITY BIRMINGHAM TYRESE'S PARENTS BELIEVE THAT HE NEEDS TO BE TOUGH 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE ANXIOUS TO STEER HIM AWAY FROM GANG CULTURE 
IF A FATHER WANTS TO BE A GOOD ROLE MODEL HE'S GOT TO SHOW THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO GO WITH A GANG 
GO TO SCHOOL GET A GOOD EDUCATION JOB WHATEVER AND JUST BE HAPPY 
I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE ON THE STREETS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
TO GIVE HIM A SENSE OF BELONGING JIMAL AND MARIE HAVE BEEN TAKING TYRESE TO AN AFTER SCHOOL CLUB 
UNLIKE IN THE RESTRICTIVE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT AT THE CLUB 
TYRESE CAN LET OFF STEAM AND GIVE HIS BOYISH EXUBERANCE FREE REIN 
HIS PARENTS HOPE THAT COMING HERE WILL BUILD TYRESE'S CONFIDENCE IN A WORLD WHERE EXPECTATIONS ARE LOW 
BECAUSE YOU GET TOLD IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT BLACK BOYS ARE THIS AND THAT 
AND SOCIETY THINKS THEY ARE THIS YOU START BELIEVING IT AND YOU THINK 
IF THEY THINK THAT ABOUT ME THEN I MIGHT AS WELL NOT BOTHER 
MARIE WORRIES THAT TYRESE'S COMMUNICATION SKILLS LET HIM DOWN 
SO SHE'S GIVING HIM A LESSON OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM 
SHE'S BROUGHT HIM TO BIRMINGHAM CARNIVAL WHERE SHE'S RUNNING A CLOTHES STALL 
SHE'S ALSO SET TYRESE UP IN BUSINESS 
FIVE P. FIVE FIFTY ONE FIFTY P. FORTY P. 
IT'S NEVER TOO YOUNG TO LET HIM KNOW ABOUT MONEY AND THE VALUE OF MONEY AND THAT EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE 
MARIE IS ALSO KEEN THAT TYRESE CONTRIBUTES TO THE FAMILY INCOME 
ALL WILL GO INTO THE GENERAL HOUSE POT OBVIOUSLY HE'LL GET A BIT OF TREAT 
AND GET TO GO ON THE RIDES WITH THE PROCEEDS BUT YES 
SO PRIMARILY HOUSE MONEY 
FIVE P. FOR FIFTY P. 
FIFTY FIFTEEN FIFTEEN 
AN HOUR LATER AND BUSINESS IS BOOMING FOR MARIE 
BUT TYRESE HAS YET TO MAKE A SINGLE SALE 
MARIE INTERVENES TO TRY TO PERSUADE HIM TAKE A MORE DYNAMIC APPROACH 
YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO CHILDREN AND SAY WE'VE GOT SOME SWEETS 
THERE'S SOME SWEETS DOWN THERE THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO BE DOING 
BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES TYRESE DECIDES THAT THE APPROACH ISN'T WORKING 
AND RUNS BACK TO HIS STALL 
TO ME HE GIVES UP TOO QUICKLY OR HE'LL SAY HE CAN'T DO IT 
KNOWING THAT SOMEONE WILL DO IT FOR HIM AND THAT'S ONE OF HIS BAD TRAITS 
I'M MORE INDEPENDENT I WON'T ASK ANYONE FOR ANYTHING 
TYRESE'S DIFFICULTY IN GETTING HIS MESSAGE ACROSS COULD BE LINKED TO HIS DYSLEXIA 
OR COULD IT ALSO BE A BOY THING 
COMMUNICATION IS A VITAL PART OF BEING HUMAN AND AT EIGHT 
OUR CHILDREN ARE DEVELOPING A VARIETY OF WAYS OF EXPRESSING THEMSELVES 
SO WE'VE PUT THEM TOGETHER IN PAIRS TO SEE WHO'S GOT THE GIFT OF THE GAB 
BACK IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES IT WAS BOYS WHO WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK OUT 
AND GIRLS WHO WERE TOLD TO BE QUIET 
WHAT'S IT LIKE NOW FOR OUR CHILDREN 
FIRST WE PUT BOYS AND GIRLS TOGETHER FOR TWO MINUTES 
OFF WE GO NOW 
YOU START NO 
I'VE GOT TWO DOGS TWO FROGS NINE FISH TEN SNAILS 
AND I GO HORSE RIDING EVERY SATURDAY YOUR GO 
I'M IN YEAR TWO A N. D. 
OOH OOH OOH OOH 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
CALVIN 
WHEN IS YOUR BIRTHDAY 
UM I FORGOT 
WHAT 
I FORGOT WHAT 
I FORGOT WHEN IT IS 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
I FORGOT WHEN MY BIRTHDAY IS WHAT 
YOU FORGOT WHEN YOUR BIRTHDAY IS YES 
MY MUM'S GOT FOUR FISH AND I'VE GOT THE REST 
THE SNAILS ARE MINE AND THE CHICKENS WILL BE MINE WHEN WE GET THEM 
PERHAPS THE BOYS' RELUCTANCE TO CHAT WAS DUE TO SHYNESS AROUND THE GIRLS 
SO NEXT WE PUT THEM IN SAME SEX PAIRS 
HELLO 
WHAT IS YOUR NAME RHIANNA 
HOW MANY NECKLACES HAVE YOU GOT AT HOME 
I'M WEARING A NECKLACE 
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT 
BUT EVEN WITH MEMBERS OF THEIR OWN SEX THE BOYS BARELY SPOKE 
IN FACT THE GIRLS SPOKE A STAGGERING TWO THIRDS MORE THAN THEM 
TYRESE SPOKE THE LEAST SAYING JUST TWENTY ONE WORDS IN SIXTEEN MINUTES 
RHIANNA SPOKE OVER FOUR HUNDRED WORDS 
WAS IT EASIER TO TALK TO THE GIRLS OR THE BOYS GIRLS 
THE GIRLS HAD MORE TO TALK ABOUT THAN THE BOYS 
DO YOU THINK BOYS ARE MORE TALKATIVE OR GIRLS ARE MORE TALKATIVE 
ONLY ONE BOY ACTUALLY TALKED TO ME THE REST JUST KEPT THEIR MOUTHS SHUT AND WENT UM UM UM 
I DIDN'T LIKE DOING IT 
WHY 
UM 
BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY 
NOTHING AT ALL 
NOTHING 
CLEARLY TODAY BOYS AREN'T UP FOR SMALL TALK 
BUT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THEY DO SPEAK NEARLY AS MUCH AS GIRLS JUST DIFFERENTLY 
IN THE PLAYGROUND GIRLS TEND TO USE TALKING AS A WAY OF SHARING GOSSIP 
AND MAKING FRIENDS 
PINK WATCHES PINK SKIRTS 
BOYS TEND TO USE LANGUAGE FOR FAR MORE PRACTICAL THINGS 
DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
IT'S A CORNER WATCH OUT 
OH IT WENT OVER THE TOP 
IN MANY WAYS THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE SEXES IS GROWING 
PARENTS MAY WELL BE FLEXIBLE ABOUT GENDER ROLES AT HOME 
BUT THE WORLD OUTSIDE IS INUNDATING OUR CHILDREN WITH IMAGES 
OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A BOY OR A GIRL 
AND OUR CHILDREN ARE EMBRACING THEM 
SO WHAT ARE PARENTS DOING 
PLAY NICE 
ALTHOUGH SEPARATED NATHAN'S PARENTS ARE STILL COMMITTED TO THEIR VISION FOR THE FAMILY 
I'M NOT SAYING WE'VE MANAGED TO DO EVERYTHING WELL BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T 
WE STRUGGLE IN THE WAY THAT EVERY PARENT STRUGGLES WE STUMBLE AND FALL 
BUT WE SUPPORT EACH OTHER AND WE ARE A TEAM WE ARE A UNIT 
THEY EVEN BELIEVE THAT NATHAN WOULD ACCEPT THE UNTHINKABLE 
YOU KNOW IF THERE WERE A BIKE AND NATHAN REALLY LIKED THE BIKE AND IT WAS PINK HE WOULD CYCLE IT 
SOMEONE WOULD TURN AND SAY THAT'S A GIRL'S BIKE 
THAT MEANS NOTHING TO HIM 
TO HIM IT'S A WAY OF GETTING A BIT OF FREEDOM AND SCOOTING ABOUT THE PLACE FAST 
HE DOESN'T CARE 
BUT HE HAS A BLACK BIKE 
WE NOW LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE THE ROLES OF THE SEXES ARE CLEARLY CHANGING 
AND OUR CHILDREN HAVE CHOICES 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU 
BORN PREMATURELY HELENA IS THE FIRST OF OUR CHILDREN TO TURN EIGHT 
BUT AS USUAL ON HER BIRTHDAY THOUGHTS TURN TO HER BROTHER AND SISTER WHO WEREN'T SO LUCKY 
I WAS THINKING IF WE HAD LITTLE MILLIE AND LITTLE BARRY AND THEY WERE ALL GROWN UP OR WHATEVER 
WELL ME AND MILLIE WOULD HAVE LIKED EACH OTHER OBVIOUSLY 
BUT LITTLE BARRY WOULD PROBABLY BE THE MOST ANNOYING 
WHY BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THAT LITTLE SISTERS AND LITTLE BROTHERS DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER 
I THINK IF LITTLE MILLIE AND LITTLE BARRY HAD LIVED YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED THEM VERY MUCH 
BUT WE MUSTN'T BE SAD BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T LIVE 
BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO BE GOING OH ALL DAY WOULD THEY 
THEY'D WANT YOU TO MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR LIFE YEAH 
AND THEY WANT YOU TO BE THE BEST THAT YOU CAN BE BECAUSE YOU'RE LIVING YOUR LIFE FOR ALL OF THEM YEAH 
IN A FAST CHANGING WORLD THINGS ARE MOVING ON FOR MEGAN 
HE JUST DUMPED ME SO I JUST DUMPED HIM 
WHY DID HE DUMP YOU 
WELL HE DUMPED ME BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHY SO I DUMPED HIM 
EVERY TIME I ASK HIM WHO DO YOU LOVE HE ALWAYS SAY ME 
BUT WHEN BRONIA ASKS HE ALWAYS SAYS HER 
SO THEY'RE TOGETHER NOW 
THE EXPERIENCE HAS PUT MEGAN RIGHT OFF BOYS 
WOULD YOU GET ANOTHER BOYFRIEND NOW NO 
COS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MARRY WHEN YOU'RE LITTLE ANYWAY 
TOMBOY MEGAN HAS SUCCUMBED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO THE DIVIDE OF THE SEXES 
BOYISH PASTIMES NO LONGER HOLD THEIR APPEAL 
ALL THE BOYS ARE ALWAYS PLAYING BOYISH STUFF 
AND I NEVER PLAY WITH THEM ANY MORE I DON'T LIKE NONE OF THEM 
BUT GAYNOR THINKS HER DAUGHTER CAN ENJOY THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS 
SHE COULD BECOME A VET SHE COULD BECOME ANYTHING REALLY 
HE'S IN THE BATH 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES IN THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY 
SEXUAL EQUALITY THE GIRLS DO JUST AS WELL 
SHE MIGHT END UP TAKING OVER THE FARM 
AND LIKE THE MODERN GIRL SHE IS MEGAN BELIEVES SHE CAN DO IT ALL 
I WANT TO BE LIKE A VET A NURSE AND A DOCTOR AT THE SAME TIME 
I CAN DO THE VET EVERY SATURDAY 
FARMER EVERY DAY I'M OFF WORK 
AND THEN A NURSE EVERY MONDAY 
TYRESE IS BEING ENCOURAGED TO DO IT ALL TOO 
JIMAL IS DETERMINED TO STOP HIM FALLING INTO THE STEREOTYPE OF AN UNDERACHIEVING BOY 
START AT THE BEGINNING THIS IS THE BEGINNING 
HE'S BEEN HELPING TYRESE WITH HIS SCHOOLWORK 
I HAVE A. 
WHEN HE GETS A NEW BOOK I READ IT WITH HIM HE'S GOT ANOTHER BOOK 
THAT I WRITE IN TO SAY HOW WELL HE'S DONE IF HE NEEDS IMPROVING 
OF PURPLE SPOTS 
AND HIS STRATEGY SEEMS TO BE PAYING OFF 
TYRESE DOES SEEM TO LIKE MALE COMPANY MORE THAN HE LIKES FEMALE COMPANY 
WHEN HE'S HERE HE'LL SAY YOUR HOUSE IS BORING IT'S BETTER AT MY DAD'S 
WHEN I COME TO MY DAD'S I LIKE PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH HIM PLEASE 
GO ON THEN 
IT'S HARDER FOR BLACK KIDS BECAUSE THE FATHER TENDS NOT TO BE THERE AS MUCH 
IT'S LIKE IF THEY ARE THERE IT'S INCONSISTENT 
SO THEY'RE NOT SEEING THEM AS A REAL ROLE MODEL 
COME ON YOU'RE THE ONE MESSING ABOUT 
THEY'RE MY KIDS SO I WANT TO SEE THEM TILL I DIE THEY'RE MY KIDS SO I'VE NO INTENTION OF DISAPPEARING 
NO INTENTION AT ALL 
ALL CHILDREN NEED SECURE RELATIONSHIPS 
ESPECIALLY WHEN LIFE TODAY OFFERS SO MANY DIFFERENT ROLE MODELS 
IN YORKSHIRE RHIANNA'S DAD ANDY HAS GOT SOME NEWS FOR THE FAMILY 
SPURRED ON BY TANYA BEING MADE REDUNDANT 
HE'S DECIDED TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE TO TRAIN AS AN ELECTRICIAN 
WHEN I REACHED FIFTY 
G. H. T. BLIMEY I'M FIFTY 
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO IT WAS ONE OF THOSE 
OH DEAR RIGHT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING NOW TANYA'S NOT BRINGING A WAGE IN 
I'VE PLAYED AROUND FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS AND I'VE HAD A GO AT THIS AND HAD A GO AT THAT 
AND MADE A COUPLE OF QUID HERE AND LOST A COUPLE OF QUID THERE 
AND NOTHING SOLID CONCRETE HAS COME FROM IT REALLY 
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO IN TEN YEARS' TIME IF RHIANNA WANTS TO GO TO UNIVERSITY 
THAT'S NOT CHEAP I'VE GOT TO PAY FOR THAT 
YOU CAN'T HIT ME YOU CAN'T HIT ME 
AND HE'S ALSO SPENDING MORE TIME AT HOME AND WITH RHIANNA 
YOU CAN'T SPRAY ME YOU STILL CAN'T SPRAY ME 
RIGHT CHICKPEA YOU DO THE WHEELS 
I'M DRENCHED 
HOW'S LIFE AT THE MOMENT RHIANNA PERFECT 
PERFECT PER 
GET IT PERFECT 
HAPPY 
THERE 
PERFECT 
SILLA HAS A SURPRISE FOR NICOLA
