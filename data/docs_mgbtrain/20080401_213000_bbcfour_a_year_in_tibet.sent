IT'S EARLY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN SOUTHERN TIBET 
SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY HAS IMPOSED 
STRICT POLITICAL CONTROL OVER THE TIBETAN POPULATION 
IN THIS EPISODE BUTRI A LIFELONG COMMUNIST PARTY WORKER 
GETS A BIG SURPRISE AS SHE APPROACHES RETIREMENT AGE 
LHAKPA A LOCAL RICKSHAW DRIVER HEADS NORTH IN SEARCH OF WORK 
BUT HE DOESN'T GET THE WELCOME HE WAS EXPECTING 
AND IN GYANTSE THE MONKS AT THE LOCAL MONASTERY 
HAVE DISCOVERED THAT SOME VALUABLE STATUES HAVE BEEN STOLEN 
THE POLICE SUSPECT IT'S AN INSIDE JOB 
THIS IS TANGMAI A SMALL VILLAGE JUST HALF AN HOUR'S DRIVE FROM GYANTSE 
THESE VILLAGES WERE ONCE THE COMMUNE SET UP BY MAO TSE TUNG IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
AND THEY'RE STILL RUN ACCORDING TO STRICT CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY GUIDELINES 
UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF A DISTRICT PARTY SECRETARY 
HELPING HIM IS A TEAM OF LOCAL TIBETAN COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIALS 
BUTRI JOINED MAO TSE TUNG'S COMMUNIST PARTY FORTY YEARS AGO 
AND SHE'S STILL A COMMITTED MEMBER 
TIBET HAS BEEN PART OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE 
IT'S THROUGH VILLAGE MEETINGS LIKE THESE 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS ABLE TO EXERT RIGID CONTROL FROM THE CAPITAL BEIJING 
IN A COUNTRY OVER TWICE THE SIZE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION 
IN GYANTSE TIBET'S THIRD LARGEST TOWN THE POLICE ARE ALWAYS BUSY 
IT'S EARLY MORNING 
THERE'S BEEN A BURGLARY AT THE MONASTERY THE LATEST OF A SERIES OF THEFTS IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS 
THE MONKS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT TWO IRREPLACEABLE STATUES HAVE BEEN STOLEN 
FOR CHOEPHEL THE DIRECTOR OF THE MONASTERY THE LOSS IS A BIG BLOW 
BUT HE'S EVEN MORE WORRIED ABOUT THE LIKELY CULPRIT 
THE BURGLARY IS GOING TO GIVE CHOEPHEL SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS 
AND BRING HIM UNDER THE CLOSE SCRUTINY OF THE LOCAL COMMUNIST PARTY 
IN THE MAIN TOWN IS LHAKPA A LOCAL RICKSHAW DRIVER 
HE'S PART OF A GROWING TIBETAN UNDERCLASS THAT PICKS UP WORK WHEREVER THEY CAN 
HE'S RECENTLY MET THE GIRL OF HIS DREAMS AND THEY'RE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT SETTLING DOWN 
LHAKPA AND DADON HAVE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER FOR THE LAST MONTH 
IN MOST OF CHINA THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOUR WOULD BE FROWNED UPON 
BUT NOT APPARENTLY IN TIBET 
AT THE MONASTERY CHOEPHEL'S GOT HIS HANDS FULL 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE BURGLARY 
HE ALSO HAS PROBLEMS WITH THE BEHAVIOUR OF SOME OF THE YOUNGER MONKS 
NOW TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE A WORK TEAM HAS BEEN SENT IN 
BY THE LOCAL COMMUNIST PARTY TO CHECK OUT WHAT'S GOING ON 
CHOEPHEL KNOWS THAT IT'S NOT ONLY THE THEFT THEY WANT TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT 
PUTTING IN A WORK TEAM LIKE THIS IS ONE WAY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
IS ABLE TO KEEP CLOSE TABS ON THE MONASTERIES 
HE'S GENUINELY PUZZLED OVER HOW THE STATUES CAME TO BE TAKEN 
ALREADY THE PARTY OFFICIALS ARE BEGINNING TO MAKE CHANGES 
CHOEPHEL UNDERSTANDS THAT CHANGES MUST BE MADE 
THE NEXT ORDER FROM THE WORK TEAM IS FOR THE MONKS TO CHECK THE INVENTORY 
WITH SECURITY SO POOR THE WORK TEAM HAVE ORDERED ALL THE VALUABLES 
TO BE PUT AWAY IN A LOCKED WAREHOUSE 
ALL FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM 
THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO THAT EVEN THE HEAD LAMA HIMSELF IS HELPING OUT 
LHAKPA IS WAITING OUTSIDE THE MONASTERY FOR A FARE 
BUT TRADE IS SLOW HE'LL HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THIS 
IF HE AND DADON ARE GOING TO HAVE A LIFE TOGETHER 
LHAKPA MAKES MONEY HOWEVER HE CAN AND OCCASIONALLY 
THERE'S WORK UNLOADING TRUCKS FOR THE CHINESE SHOP OWNERS 
AND THE PAY 
UNLOADING TRUCKS IS JUST ONE OF LHAKPA'S MANY CASUAL JOBS 
BUTRI IS ON ONE OF HER REGULAR VISITS TO THE LOCAL NUNNERY 
IN HER CAPACITY AS A COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIAL 
THROUGHOUT THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THERE WAS WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION OF RELIGIOUS SITES IN TIBET 
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT OVER SIX THOUSAND BUDDHIST MONASTERIES WERE DESTROYED 
TODAY SOME OF THE MONASTERIES AND NUNNERIES ARE BEING REBUILT 
BUT THE LIVES OF BUDDHIST MONKS AND NUNS CONTINUE TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT 
AND THIS IS ALL PART OF BUTRI'S JOB 
ALMOST EVERY PART OF THE DAILY LIVES OF MONKS AND NUNS IS REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENT 
IT'S A WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT ANY DISSENT OR OPPOSITION 
TOWARDS THE COMMUNIST PARTY IS DETECTED EARLY AND DEALT WITH SWIFTLY 
COMMUNIST PARTY REGULATIONS ARE SO STRICT THAT PEOPLE LIKE BUTRI AREN'T EVEN ALLOWED TO VISIT MONASTERIES 
UNLESS IT'S PART OF THEIR OFFICIAL DUTIES 
BUTRI HAS DEDICATED HER LIFE TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY FOR FORTY YEARS 
AND LIKE ALL SUCH OFFICIALS IN TIBET SHE HAD TO RENOUNCE BUDDHISM 
A BIG DECISION FOR ANY TIBETAN 
BUT OLD HABITS DIE HARD 
LHAKPA IS AT HOME WITH DADON HIS BROTHERS ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE LACK OF WORK IN TOWN 
EVER SINCE MIGRANT CHINESE WORKERS CAME TO GYANTSE WAGE RATES HAVE GONE DOWN 
AND TENSION HAS GONE UP 
LHAKPA HAS A NEW PLAN TO EARN SOME SERIOUS MONEY 
HE WANTS TO WORK ON A BUILDING SITE IN THE TOWN OF NAQU SIX HUNDRED KILOMETRES AWAY 
BUT LHAKPA'S PLAN DOES HAVE ITS RISKS 
THEY HAVE ONLY A COUPLE OF DAYS TO PREPARE FOR THEIR LONG JOURNEY NORTH 
AT THE MONASTERY THE POLICE STILL HAVEN'T CAUGHT THE THIEVES 
BUT THE WORK TEAM WANTS THE SECURITY IMPROVED IMMEDIATELY 
DEPUTY HEAD LAMA TSULTRIM HAS BEEN TOLD TO MAKE CHANGES 
HIS FIRST JOB IS TO INSTALL METAL GRILLES AROUND THE MOST VALUABLE STATUES 
ON THE ROOF TECHNICIANS ARE PUTTING IN THE NEW SECURITY SYSTEMS 
IT'S THE MORNING THAT LHAKPA AND HIS BROTHER LEAVE FOR NAQU 
DADON IS GOING AS WELL AS LHAKPA'S SISTER IN LAW 
LHAKPA'S MOTHER IS NERVOUS ABOUT THEIR PLAN 
TRADITIONALLY THE KHATA IS GIVEN FOR GOOD LUCK 
LHAKPA'S MOTHER HAS NO IDEA OF THE TROUBLE HER SONS WILL SOON FACE UP NORTH 
LHAKPA'S SISTER IN LAW YANGCHEN WILL BE STAYING BEHIND 
TO LOOK AFTER HER TWO LITTLE BOYS AND HIS MOTHER 
THE SIX HUNDRED KILOMETRE BUS JOURNEY TO NAQU IS GOING TO TAKE THEM TWO DAYS 
AND IT'S THE LONGEST TRIP THAT ANY OF THEM HAS EVER MADE 
THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CONSTANTLY WORRIES 
THAT SOME MONKS MIGHT SECRETLY SUPPORT THE DALAI LAMA 
AND ACTIVELY WORK TOWARDS TIBETAN INDEPENDENCE 
THEY SEE THIS AS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS TO STABILITY IN TIBET 
THERE'S NO SUGGESTION THAT THIS IS THE CASE IN THIS MONASTERY 
BUT THE WORK TEAM IS VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE BEHAVIOUR OF SOME OF THE MONKS 
THEY'RE USING THE BURGLARY AS A REASON TO TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON 
AND TO MAKE SURE THE MONKS STICK TO THE RULES 
THE MONKS MIGHT RESENT THE INTRUSION OF THE OFFICIALS BUT THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT 
AND THERE'S WORSE TO COME 
LHAKPA HAS ARRIVED IN NAQU A REMOTE AND DESOLATE TOWN IN NORTH EASTERN TIBET 
HERE HIGH ON THE TIBETAN PLATEAU THE WINTERS ARE LONG DRY AND COLD 
AT NIGHT TEMPERATURES OFTEN FALL TWENTY DEGREES BELOW FREEZING 
THERE'S PLENTY OF WORK HERE FOR PEOPLE LIKE LHAKPA 
BECAUSE THE LOCALS PREFER TO HAVE TIBETANS BUILD THEIR HOUSES 
RATHER THAN EMPLOY MIGRANT WORKERS FROM OTHER PARTS OF CHINA 
IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS 
LHAKPA'S GOING TO FIND OUT JUST HOW TOUGH THINGS CAN REALLY GET 
EVERY YEAR IN MARCH THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF CHINA 
THE COMMUNIST PARTY HOLD LOCAL MEETINGS TO COINCIDE 
WITH THE PEOPLE'S CONGRESS HELD IN BEIJING 
IT'S THE SAME IN GYANTSE 
THIS IS JUST ANOTHER WAY THE COMMUNIST PARTY IS ABLE 
TO EXERCISE CONTROL OVER A NATION OF THIRTEEN BILLION PEOPLE 
PREVIOUSLY THE MONASTERY WAS COMMENDED FOR ITS WORK 
THIS YEAR THEY DIDN'T GET ANY PRAISE 
THEY WEREN'T EVEN CRITICISED 
THEY WERE SIMPLY IGNORED CHOEPHEL HAS GOT THE MESSAGE 
EVEN AFTER MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS OF COMMUNIST RULE 
THE NATURAL RHYTHM OF THE SEASONS STILL DOMINATES LIFE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
SPRING HAS FINALLY COME TO THE VILLAGE OF TANGMAI 
AND IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE PLANTING SEASON 
TIBETANS CELEBRATE OVER TWENTY TRADITIONAL FESTIVALS A YEAR 
AND BUTRI'S JOB AS A COMMUNIST PARTY WORKER 
IS TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE BEHAVE THEMSELVES DURING THE CELEBRATIONS 
TODAY IT'S THE COW RACING FESTIVAL 
AND COMMUNIST PARTY RULES AREN'T GOING TO STOP TIBETANS FROM HAVING A GOOD TIME 
THE GROUP HAVE BEEN IN NAQU NOW FOR OVER A MONTH 
BUT THERE'S BEEN TROUBLE ON THE BUILDING SITE 
AND LHAKPA'S BEEN ACCUSED OF FIGHTING 
NOW THE BUILDER WANTS TO CONFRONT LHAKPA ABOUT THE TROUBLE HE'S CAUSED 
THEY'VE ALL BEEN THROWN OFF THE BUILDING SITE 
THE GROUP HAS TO LEAVE NAQU QUICKLY AND THE FASTEST WAY OUT IS BY TRAIN 
LHAKPA LIKE MANY POORLY EDUCATED TIBETANS FINDS READING CHINESE DIFFICULT 
IN FACT NEARLY FIFTY PER CENT OF TIBETANS CAN NEITHER READ NOR WRITE 
TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ANY OF THEM HAVE EVER BEEN ON A TRAIN 
THE NEW TRAIN CONNECTING TIBET TO THE REST OF CHINA 
IS THE HIGHEST RAILWAY IN THE WORLD AND ITS CONSTRUCTION HAS BEEN VERY CONTROVERSIAL 
IT TRAVELS AT AN ALTITUDE OF OVER FIVE THOUSAND METRES 
WHERE THERE'S ONLY HALF THE OXYGEN THAT THERE IS AT SEA LEVEL 
DESPITE THEIR PROBLEMS IN NAQU DADON IS ALREADY THINKING ABOUT HER FUTURE WITH LHAKPA 
IN THE VILLAGE BUTRI HAS TO SORT OUT A FIGHT BETWEEN FARM WORKERS 
THEY HAPPEN ALL THE TIME AND AS A PARTY OFFICIAL 
SHE'S ON CALL TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS LIKE THIS 
BUTRI'S FIRST JOB IS TO TAKE THE CASUALTY TO THE CLINIC TO SEE DOCTOR LHAMO 
FIGHTS LIKE THIS AMONG YOUNG FARM WORKERS 
ARE USUALLY THE RESULT OF TOO MUCH DRINKING IN THE FIELDS 
WHEN THERE'S AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS BUTRI HAS TO REPORT IT UP THROUGH THE PARTY HIERARCHY 
SHE'S OFF TO SEE THE HEAD OF THE VILLAGE 
AT THE MONASTERY CHOEPHEL IS CRACKING THE WHIP 
AND HE'S CALLED ALL THE MONKS TOGETHER 
HE'S ABOUT TO READ THEM THE RIOT ACT 
THE DEPUTY LAMA TSULTRIM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DISCIPLINE 
HE'S JUST INSTIGATED A NEW POLICY OF BONUSES AND FINES 
IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE MONKS 
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE MORE FINES THAN THERE ARE BONUSES 
CHOEPHEL FREELY ADMITS HE'S STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE IN THE MONASTERY 
LHAKPA IS BACK IN GYANTSE AND WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS HE CAN ALWAYS FALL BACK ON HIS RICKSHAW 
LHAKPA KNOWS THAT BEING A RICKSHAW DRIVER 
IS NO WAY TO START MARRIED LIFE WITH DADON 
AND HE NEEDS TO FIND HIMSELF A BETTER JOB 
IN TANGMAI VILLAGE BUTRI'S GOT YET ANOTHER PROBLEM TO SORT OUT 
SIX MONTHS AGO THE LOCAL SCHOOL BUILDING WAS CONDEMNED 
AS BEING UNSAFE AND THE CHILDREN HAD TO TAKE THEIR LESSONS OUTSIDE 
IN HER POSITION AS A LOCAL COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIAL 
BUTRI WAS ASKED TO ORGANISE THE REBUILDING OF THE SCHOOLHOUSE 
UNFORTUNATELY THINGS DIDN'T GO TOO WELL 
BUTRI WAS SUPPLIED WITH POOR QUALITY MATERIALS AND THE CEMENT WOULDN'T SET PROPERLY 
BUTRI IS A PARTY WORKER NOT A BUILDER 
AND SHE WAS CLEARLY OUT OF HER DEPTH 
FOR BUTRI HOWEVER COMPLAINTS ARE EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S GOING TO GET 
LHAKPA'S NEW PLAN TO MAKE SOME SERIOUS MONEY 
IS TO BUY A MOTOR RICKSHAW 
LHAKPA HAS NEVER OWNED A MOTORBIKE BEFORE BUT IN TIBET 
YOU DON'T NEED A LICENCE AND INSURANCE ISN'T COMPULSORY EITHER 
EVEN FOR A PASSENGER RICKSHAW 
AT LAST LHAKPA MIGHT JUST BE ABLE TO MAKE A NEW START IN LIFE 
THE GOVERNMENT WORK TEAM IS BACK AT THE MONASTERY 
AND THEY'VE COME TO APPROVE TSULTRIM'S NEW SECURITY SYSTEMS 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITS SIX HUNDRED YEAR HISTORY THE PEL KOR MONASTERY 
IS NOW UNDER THE WATCHFUL GAZE OF TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY 
BUT THE MONKS ALSO RELY ON MORE TRADITIONAL SECURITY METHODS 
DESPITE ALL THE BEST EFFORTS OF THE POLICE AND THE PARTY OFFICIALS 
THEY STILL HAVEN'T FOUND THE CULPRIT 
BUTRI'S BEEN CALLED TO A MEETING OF THE VILLAGE HEADS 
ABOUT THE SCHOOL BUILDING AND THEY'RE NOT VERY HAPPY 
BUTRI'S BEEN PUT ON THE SPOT AND SHE HAS TO JUSTIFY HER POSITION 
ALL THE HEADS OF THE LOCAL VILLAGES ARE VERY CRITICAL OF BUTRI'S WORK 
IT'S BUTRI'S JOB TO SORT OUT THE PROBLEM AND REPORT EVERYTHING TO HER SUPERIORS 
THE PROBLEMS WITH THE SCHOOL BUILDING ARE GOING TO COME BACK TO HAUNT BUTRI 
LHAKPA IS NOW IN BUSINESS WITH HIS NEW MOTOR RICKSHAW 
AND HE'S TRYING HIS HAND AT BEING A TOURIST GUIDE TOO 
HE'S TAKING HIS FIRST CUSTOMER AND AN INTERPRETER 
TO THE OLD FORTRESS IN GYANTSE 
THE SITE OF AN EPIC BATTLE WITH THE BRITISH 
WHEN HUNDREDS OF TIBETAN SOLDIERS WERE SLAUGHTERED BY A VASTLY SUPERIOR ARMY 
IN FRONT OF THE TOURIST LHAKPA'S RESPONSE IS PREDICTABLE 
THE WORK TEAM HAS NOW BEEN IN THE MONASTERY FOR SEVERAL WEEKS 
AND CHOEPHEL HAS GOT THE MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR 
BUTRI HAS JUST COME OUT OF A COMMUNIST PARTY COMMITTEE MEETING 
BOTH SHE AND HER DISTRICT PARTY SECRETARY QUIME ARE SHOCKED BY THE NEWS 
HER VILLAGE HAS NO SAY IN PARTY DECISIONS LIKE THESE 
ALTHOUGH BUTRI'S WORKED FOR THE COMMUNIST PARTY FOR FORTY YEARS 
SHE'S NEVER HAD A WRITTEN CONTRACT AND WITHOUT ONE SHE WON'T GET A PENSION 
BUTRI NOW FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
NEXT TIME A MONK AT THE PEL KOR MONASTERY DIES 
AND HE'S GIVEN A TRADITIONAL TIBETAN BURIAL 
TSEPHUN THE YOUNGEST MONK IN THE MONASTERY IS THREATENED WITH EXPULSION 
AND TSULTRIM THE DEPUTY HEAD LAMA PREPARES FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENT OF THE YEAR 
THE BUDDHA'S BIRTHDAY 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX 
DAN CRUICKSCHANK'S ADVENTURES IN ARCHITECTURE
