THAT'S RIGHT DOCTOR MUSIBA 
YOUR BLOOD HAS AN ABNORMALLY HIGH CALCIUM CONTENT WHICH IS MAKING YOU FEEL CONFUSED 
AND WHAT IS YOUR DIAGNOSIS DOCTOR 
DOCTOR WINTERS 
WELL LOOKING AT THE LESIONS ON YOUR X. RAY IT'S CONSISTENT WITH MYELOMA 
MYELOMA

SOMEBODY TOLD YOU THEY WERE WRONG 
WELL NOT IN SO MANY WORDS 
WHO 
THE CLINICAL LEAD I DON'T WANT TO GET THEM IN TROUBLE 
IT'S NOT THEM THAT'S IN TROUBLE 
DOCTOR WINTERS YOU DEFERRED TO A JUNIOR DOCTOR ON NON CLINICAL DUTIES 
INSTEAD OF TRUSTING YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT 
THE NEXT TIME YOU MUDDLE THROUGH A PROCEDURE YOU ARE NOT WILLING 
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WILL BE YOUR LAST UNDERSTAND 
CAN I JUST SAY TOBY MANAGED VERY WELL UNDER MY SUPERVISION EARLIER TODAY 
MAGGIE YOU CAUTIONED ME ABOUT THIS DOCTOR'S SUITABILITY 
AND YOU WERE THE ONE WHO ADVISED ME TO COME DOWNSTAIRS THIS EVENING 
YOU WERE RIGHT ON BOTH OCCASIONS 
YOU DID IT AGAIN IT WASN'T LIKE THAT 
YOU EXPECTED ME TO FAIL 
TOBY BELIEVE IT OR NOT I CAN DO THIS AND I WANT TO PROVE IT 
I JUST WANTED TO HELP YOU I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP MAGGIE 
THERE HE IS THE NOTORIOUS PIRATE ORTHOPOD OF HOLBY 
WHAT TIME D'YOU CALL THIS JOANNE 
I'M A COWBOY ORTHOPOD ACCORDING TO THE BOSS 
THAT BAD WAS IT YEAH 
HOW'S MY LITTLE LANA

JUST YOU TWO GO AND I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER YOU SURE 
YEAH I'M SURE O. K. COME ON THEN YOU 
I'VE GOT A BOTTLE IN THE FRIDGE LET'S GO AND COMMISERATE PROPERLY 
SO WE'LL REQUEST A PROTEIN ELECTROPHORESIS TO CHECK FOR ANY PARA PROTEINS 
OR YOU COULD ORGANISE A BONE MARROW BIOPSY 
WE COULD LOOK IN TO THAT 
THEY SEEM TO BE GETTING ON LIKE A HOUSE ON FIRE 
SO WHAT'S THE STORY WITH THE GOOD DOCTOR HERE THEN 
MYELOMA BONE MARROW CANCER 
AND THAT MAKES YOU GO LOOPY AND STEAL BABIES I DON'T THINK SO 
IT CAUSES LESIONS WHICH CAN LEAD TO INCREASED CALCIUM IN THE BLOOD WHICH CAUSES CONFABULATION 
WHEN YOU MIX UP MEMORIES FROM THE PAST WITH THE PRESENT 
IN DOCTOR MUSIBA'S CASE A FIRE IN A CHILDREN'S WARD 
VERY CLEVER NOTHING TO DO WITH ME
