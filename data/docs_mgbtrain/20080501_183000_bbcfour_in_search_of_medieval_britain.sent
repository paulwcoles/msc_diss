A UNIQUE WINDOW ONTO LIFE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE MIDDLE AGES 
USING THIS MAP I'M GOING TO TRY TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IN MEDIEVAL BRITAIN 
THIS TIME I'M TRAVELLING THROUGH CENTRAL ENGLAND 
VISITING ONE OF ENGLAND'S OLDEST PUBS AND THE MEDIEVAL WORLD'S TALLEST BUILDING 
EXPOSING THE GANGSTERS BEHIND A COLOURFUL LEGEND 
AND DISCOVERING MORE ABOUT LIFE ON THE ROAD IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
OH THAT'S LOVELY OH 
I'M STARTING IN THE NORTH EAST MIDLANDS IN LEICESTERSHIRE 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES AS NOW THIS WAS A BIG AREA FOR FARMING 
AND IN THOSE DAYS ANY FARMER WITH ANYTHING TO SELL HAD TO COME TO MARKET 
A LIVESTOCK MARKET HAS BEEN HELD 
HERE AT MELTON MOWBRAY EVERY TUESDAY FOR MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED YEARS 
AND ALONGSIDE ALL OF THE CASTLES AND CATHEDRALS OF OTHER TOWNS THE MARKET ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO WARRANT 
A PLACE FOR MELTON ON THIS FOURTEENTH CENTURY MAP 
IN THE DOOMSDAY BOOK IT'S LISTED AS THE ONLY MARKET IN THE WHOLE OF LEICESTERSHIRE 
AT THAT TIME TOWNS REQUIRED A ROYAL CHARTER TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO RUN 
AN OFFICIAL MARKET MELTON'S CHARTER WAS FIRST GRANTED IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY BY EDWARD THE CONFESSOR 
AND THE MARKET PUT MELTON MOWBRAY ON THE MAP 
TRADESMEN CAME FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SELLING VEGETABLES CROPS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY LIVESTOCK 
THE MARKET AUTHORITY CHARGED A TOLL ON EVERY SALE 
A HALFPENNY FOR A COW OR A HORSE A FARTHING FOR A SHEEP OR A PIG 
AND EVERY STORE HOLDER WAS CHARGED A PENNY 
ACCORDING TO RECORDS THE MARKET HAD A HUNDRED STALLS AT ITS PEAK 
SELLING FIFTY CATTLE A WEEK AND NEARLY THREE TONNES OF CHEESE OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR 
THE TOWN IS STILL FAMOUS FOR ITS FOOD TODAY FOR STILTON AND ESPECIALLY FOR PORK PIES 
THE MILTON MOWBRAY PIE CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTIES 
BUT MEDIEVAL PIE MAKERS WERE PUTTING PORK INTO PASTRY LONG BEFORE THAT 
PROSPEROUS MARKETS LIKE MELTON PROVIDED LUXURY INGREDIENTS TO THE WEALTHIEST OF KITCHENS 
AND SURVIVING RECIPES GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO THE CUISINE OF THE WELL HEALED 
I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU A PLANTAGENET PORK PIE FROM THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETIES SPLENDID 
IT'S A RECIPE FROM THE FORM OF CURIE WHICH IS A BOOK PROBABLY WRITTEN BY RICHARD THE SECOND'S MASTER CHEF 
HE TELLS US TO TAKE PORK THAT'S BEEN COOKED FOR 
A COUPLE OF HOURS AND GRIND IT WHICH MEANS PUTTING IT INTO A MORTAR 
THE MEDIEVAL FOOD PROCESSOR IF YOU LIKE WAS A LITTLE BOY WHO SPENT ALL DAY 
WITH A HUGE PESTLE AND MORTAR JUST GRINDING THINGS UP AND THEY LOVED THEIR FOOD TO BE 
IN PUREE AND PULPY FORM BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE FORKS SO THEY'D EAT WITH A SPOON OR THEIR FINGERS 
OR THE END OF A KNIFE 
IN THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD THEY HAD A RANGE OF READY PREPARED SPICE MIXTURES 
THIS IS CALLED POUDRE DOUCE 
AND IT'S GOT SUGAR IN IT OH GINGER 
IT'S ALSO GOT SOMETHING CALLED CUBEBS IN IT WHICH IS A KIND OF PEPPER 
I CAN TASTE THE PEPPER YEAH 
AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF THAT IN THERE 
TRADE WAS MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE THAN WE BELIEVED 
AND PEOPLE OFTEN THINK THE SPICES WERE USED TO DISGUISE TAINTED MEAT 
BUT OF COURSE IT WAS ONLY THE VERY WEALTHY WHO COULD AFFORD SPICES 
THEY DIDN'T EAT TAINTED MEAT THEY ATE BEST QUALITY MEAT THEY LIKED THE FLAVOUR OF THESE THINGS 
AND PROBABLY THE MOST DRAMATIC THING THAT THEY DID THAT WE DON'T WAS THEY PUT A LOT OF SUGAR IN WITH MEAT 
YOUR SUGAR WAS SUCH AN EXPENSIVE COMMODITY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE 
USED SWEET FRUIT AND FIGS ARE REALLY COMMON IN MEDIEVAL RECIPES 
IN ONE FIFTEENTH CENTURY RECIPE FOR THIS PIE THERE ARE FIGS CHOPPED UP AND PUT IN WITH THE MEAT MIXTURE 
IF YOU PUT THAT BOARD THERE ALIXE 
THAT'S IT 
WE CAN'T HAVE A PIE WITHOUT A PASTRY CASE IN THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD THE CASE WAS CALLED A COFFIN 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE POTTERY BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE MAKING 
IS A CASSEROLE MADE OUT OF PASTRY WHICH ISN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO BE EATEN BY THE DINERS 
WE'RE TOLD TO MAKE AN OVAL SHAPED COFFIN 
SO WE'RE GOING TO USE THE FORMER TO CREATE SOME WALLS 
THAT DOES LOOK LIKE A MEDIEVAL STONE COFFIN THOUGH THE WAY THAT YOU'RE MAKING IT 
EXACTLY A SARCOPHAGUS 
THESE LITTLE THINGS WERE CALLED POINTERS OR POINTS AND THEY'RE WHAT GIVES THE DISH ITS NAME 
BECAUSE A FLAWN POINT WHICH IS WHAT THIS PIE IS CALLED IS A FLAN THAT'S GOT POINTS STICKING OUT OF IT 
RIGHT FLAWN IS THE WORD WHICH WE GET FLAN FROM BUT IT IS AN OPEN PIE 
IT'S NOT LIKE A MODERN MELTON MOWBRAY PIE WHICH IS A CLOSED PIE SURE 
IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A CROWN 
ACTUALLY IT LOOKS REALLY LIKE A JESTER'S CAP DOESN'T IT IT DOES YEAH 
THE WEALTH GENERATED BY MELTON MOWBRAY'S MARKET 
WAS FLAUNTED BY THE TOWN'S PARISH CHURCH BUILT LARGELY ON THE PROFITS FROM LIVESTOCK AND CHEESE 
IT WAS ENTIRELY NORMAL FOR A MEDIEVAL TOWN TO INVEST MUCH OF ITS WEALTH IN A HOUSE OF GOD 
AND IN THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTY OF LINCOLNSHIRE MONEY FROM THE WOOL TRADE 
HELPED TO CREATE ONE OF THE MOST AUDACIOUS BUILDINGS IN THE HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES THE CHURCH DOMINATED ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE 
FROM BIRTH UNTIL DEATH AND EVERYONE WAS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO ITS UPKEEP AS WELL 
GIVING AT LEAST A TENTH OF EVERYTHING THAT THEY EARNED 
FAILURE TO GIVE GENEROUSLY COULD JEOPARDISE YOUR IMMORTAL SOUL 
BUT GIVING MORE COULD EASE YOUR WAY TO PARADISE 
WITH THE MONEY THAT IT COLLECTED THE CHURCH WAS ABLE TO BUILD ASTONISHING CATHEDRALS LIKE THIS ONE 
BY THE TIME OF THE MAP LINCOLN CATHEDRAL DOMINATED THE SKYLINE 
ONE OF THE MEDIEVAL WORLD'S GREATEST ARCHITECTURAL ACHIEVEMENTS 
THIS TOWERING CATHEDRAL IS A SYMBOL OF GOD'S POWER HERE ON EARTH 
AND IN THE MIDDLE AGES IT WAS ALSO SEEN AS 
A KIND OF GIANT SHIP THAT WOULD CARRY A CARGO OF THE FAITHFUL SAFELY THROUGH THIS LIFE AND INTO THE NEXT 
IT WAS A CONSPICUOUS REMINDER TO EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD 
OF THE LIFE LONG BATTLE FOR SALVATION 
TODAY THE CATHEDRAL'S MOST STRIKING FEATURE IS ITS MASSIVE CENTRAL TOWER 
NEARLY THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH BUT THE TOWER IS ONLY HALF THE STORY 
WE HAVE HERE A WONDERFUL MODEL OF THE CATHEDRAL 
THE CENTRAL TOWER WAS FINISHED UP TO THIS LEVEL BY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
AND THEN CUPPED BY THIS ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE SPIRE 
WHICH EFFECTIVELY DOUBLED THE HEIGHT OF THE CATHEDRAL AND WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE FOR MILES AND MILES AROUND 
THE TIP OF THE SPIRE REACHED A STAGGERING FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FEET MAKING THIS 
THE WORLD'S TALLEST BUILDING SURPASSING THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA AFTER FOUR THOUSAND YEARS 
FOR SOME TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS THE SPIRE SURVIVED AND THEN IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY NINE IT WAS BLOWN DOWN 
WE'RE NOW STANDING ON THE ROOF OF THE CENTRAL TOWER WHICH IS THE TALLEST PLACE IN LINCOLNSHIRE 
BUT IN FACT WE'RE ACTUALLY AT THE BASE OF THE MEDIEVAL SPIRE 
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SPIRE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HERE 
WELL IT WAS A TIMBER FRAME CLAD IN LEAD AND WE THINK THAT THE TIMBER WOULD HAVE ROTTED OVER TIME 
AND THE FRAME WHICH WAS SUPPORTING ALL OF THE SPIRE JUST STARTED TO COLLAPSE 
IT WAS A DISASTER THAT TELLS US MUCH ABOUT THE WAY THAT MEDIEVAL BUILDERS REALLY WORKED 
THEY HAD NO COMPUTER MODELLING AND THERE WERE NO STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS 
THEY WERE THE GREAT EXPERIMENTERS OF THEIR DAY WITH NOTHING TO RELY ON EXCEPT EXPERIENCE AND INTUITION 
THESE WOODEN BEAMS WERE WEDGED INTO THE TOWERS MAIN ARCHES DURING CONSTRUCTION 
AND THEY GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO HOW THE BUILDERS WORKED 
THEY WERE PUT IN IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT BUT NEVER HAVE BEEN 
OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY LOST NERVE AND SAID IS THAT ARCH REALLY VERY STABLE OR NOT AND LEFT THEM IN 
THIS CAUTION WAS BORN OF BITTER EXPERIENCE 
DURING THE BUILDING OF THE CATHEDRAL THE CENTRAL TOWER HAD ALREADY COLLAPSED SEVERAL TIMES 
THE LAST OCCASION BEING IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN 
WE HAD A MAJOR COLLAPSE HERE WITH THE TOWER AND THEN IT WAS REBUILT 
AND THIS IS WHAT ROSE OUT OF THE RUBBLE THEN THIS IS WHAT ROSE OUT OF THE RUBBLE YES 
INSTEAD OF SCALING BACK THEIR AMBITIONS 
THEY ACTUALLY PUSHED THEM FURTHER BECAUSE THIS IS A TALLER TOWER THAN THE ONE THAT IT REPLACES 
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE TOWER COLLAPSED HERE WHY DID IT COLLAPSE 
WELL THEY WERE BUILDING BEYOND THEIR COMPETENCE AT THE TIME 
THEY JUST PUSHED EVERYTHING A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR AND THE STRUCTURE WASN'T QUITE STRONG ENOUGH 
BUT THAT GAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO QUITE LITERALLY PICK THEMSELVES UP AND START AGAIN 
THE ONE THING ABOUT LINCOLN CATHEDRAL IT'S NOT MODEST IN ANY WAY 
EVERY TIME THEY DID SOMETHING THEY WENT OVER THE TOP THEY MADE IT BIGGER AND BIGGER 
IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST MEDIEVAL BUILDINGS IN EUROPE 
THEY WERE MAKING A MASSIVE STATEMENT 
AND FOR TWO AND A HALF CENTURIES TILL THE SPIRE WAS BLOWN DOWN 
LINCOLN MUST HAVE SEEMED TO REACH UP TO HEAVEN ITSELF 
TO THE MEDIEVAL PEASANT IN THE FIELDS OUTSIDE LINCOLN THE TOWERING CATHEDRAL LEFT NO DOUBT 
ABOUT THE SUPREMACY OF THE CHURCH FOR THEIR'S WAS A HUMBLE EXISTENCE SCRATCHING A LIVING FROM THE SOIL 
HERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF LINCOLN IS SOUTH COMMON 
LIKE MOST COMMONS IN THE MIDDLE AGES THIS WAS CALLED WASTELAND LAND THAT WAS JUST TOO POOR TO FARM 
BUT BACK THEN WASTELAND WAS ANYTHING BUT WASTED 
IT WAS ALSO AN ESSENTIAL SOURCE OF EXTRA FOOD FUEL AND BUILDING MATERIALS 
FOR PEASANTS THE VALUABLE RESOURCES OF THESE MEDIEVAL WASTELANDS PROMPTED A CRUCIAL DEVELOPMENT 
A SYSTEM OF RIGHTS FOR COMMON PEOPLE WHICH SHAPED ENGLISH LAW FOR EVER 
THE MEAGRE SPOILS OF THE WASTELAND WERE SHARED OUT AMONGST THE PEASANTS 
EACH HOUSEHOLD WAS GRANTED A RIGHT TO EXPLOIT A PARTICULAR RESOURCE 
THESE RIGHTS HAD NAMES THAT HAVE LONG SINCE FALLEN OUT OF COMMON USE 
THE RIGHT OF ESTOVER TO COLLECT FALLEN BRANCHES AND BRACKEN 
HERBAGE TO GRAZE LIVESTOCK 
AND TURBERY TO CUT PEAT AND TURF FOR FUEL 
THE RIGHT TO LET YOUR PIGS FORAGE FOR ACORNS WAS CALLED PANNAGE 
THE RIGHT TO FISH CALLED PISCARY 
AND TO DIG FERTILE SOIL THE RIGHT OF MORAL 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE NEW LAWS WERE PASSED TO PROTECT COMMON RIGHTS 
THEY STILL APPLY TODAY THOUGH MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA OF THE RIGHTS THEY HOLD 
HERE ON LINCOLN'S COMMONS EVERY CITY HOUSEHOLD STILL HAS THE RIGHT TO GRAZE HORSES 
BUT THE SYSTEM'S MOST IMPORTANT LEGACY IS HOW IT DEALT WITH PEOPLE WHO BROKE THE LAW 
IF YOU ABUSED YOUR RIGHTS STEALING SOMEONE ELSE'S TWIGS OR GRAZING TOO MANY CATTLE 
YOU'D RECEIVE EXACTLY THE SAME PUNISHMENT AS THE LAST PERSON WHO COMMITTED THAT CRIME 
THIS SYSTEM OF PRECEDENT UNDERPINS ENGLISH COMMON LAW TO THIS DAY 
BUT THE SECURITY OFFERED BY THESE LAWS ONLY GAVE LIMITED PROTECTION 
NEARBY LAY LAWLESS FORESTS AND MEDIEVAL TRAVELLERS VENTURED THERE AT THEIR PERIL 
I'M HEADING WEST TO NOTTINGHAM WHERE THE MOST FAMOUS MEDIEVAL FOREST OF ALL 
IS SHOWN ON THE GOUGH MAP BY A SINGLE TWISTED TREE 
AND WHERE EVEN TODAY THERE STANDS A ONE THOUSAND YEAR OLD GIANT KNOWN AS THE MAJOR OAK 
THIS OLD OAK ALREADY WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE AN IMPRESSIVE SPECIMEN AT THE TIME THAT THE GOUGH MAP WAS MADE 
TODAY IT'S IN A COUNTRY PARK BUT BACK IN THE MIDDLE AGES IT WAS AT THE CENTRE OF A VAST HUNTING GROUND 
STRETCHING EIGHT MILES WIDE BY TWENTY MILES LONG 
THIS WAS THE HEART OF SHERWOOD FOREST 
TO MOST OF US THE VERY NAME IS SYNONYMOUS WITH ONE VERY ROMANTIC FIGURE 
LEGEND HAS IT THAT ROBIN HOOD AND HIS MERRY BAND 
USED THIS TREE AS A HIDEOUT BUT NO ONE'S EVER BEEN ABLE TO PROVE IT 
IN FACT NO ONE'S EVER BEEN ABLE TO PROVE THAT ROBIN HOOD EXISTED AT ALL 
WHAT'S MORE THE ROMANTIC LEGEND OF ROBIN HOOD 
ALTRUISTICALLY STEALING FROM THE RICH IN ORDER TO GIVE TO THE POO 
CONCEALS A FAR MORE BRUTAL REALITY 
THE PEOPLE WHO RULED THE WOODS WERE WIDELY FEARED ANYTHING BUT THE LOVEABLE ROGUES OF FOLKLORE 
THEY WERE THUGS AND GANGSTERS 
ROBBERY AND EXTORTION WERE BREAD AND BUTTER CRIMES FOR FOREST OUTLAWS 
THEY WOULD PLUNDER VILLAGES AND CHURCHES AND PREY UPON PEOPLE TRAVELLING ALONG THE HIGHWAYS 
IN THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTIES THIS REGION WAS TERRORISED 
BY THE SOCIETY OF JAMES COTTERILL A VICIOUS GANG WHO SPECIALISED IN KIDNAP AND EVEN MURDER 
AFTER A PARTICULARLY BRUTAL KILLING OF A LOCAL WEALTHY NOBLEMAN JAMES COTTERILL REFUSED TO APPEAR AT COURT 
AND THEN ON THE TWENTIETH MARCH ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE HE WAS OFFICIALLY OUTLAWED 
ANYONE WHO FLED THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW WAS FORMALLY DECLARED AN OUTLAW 
BANISHED ONCE AND FOR ALL FROM SOCIETY 
STRIPPED OF ALL CIVIL RIGHTS THE OUTLAW COULD BE KILLED WITH IMPUNITY 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES FOR EVERY CONVICTED FELON THERE WERE TEN TIMES THAT NUMBER OUTLAWED 
COTTERILL WAS JUST ONE WHOSE VICIOUS EXPLOITS WERE RELAYED IN THE TALES OF MEDIEVAL STORYTELLERS 
OVER THE CENTURIES MANY LEGENDS MERGED AND WERE WIDELY ROMANTICISED 
TO PRODUCE THE MYTH WE KNOW TODAY 
OUTLAWS DROVE FEAR INTO THE HEART OF MEDIEVAL ENGLAND 
IT CAN BE NO SURPRISE THAT THEIR FEARSOME REPUTATION 
FUELLED SUCH A COMPELLING LEGEND AS ROBIN HOOD 
APART FROM THE THREAT OF VIOLENT ROBBERY THE ORDINARY TRAVELLER ALSO 
HAD TO CONTEND WITH WILD BOAR PACKS OF FERAL DOGS AND WOLVES 
THEY HAD NO MAP NO COMPASS ONLY THE NAME OF THE NEXT DESTINATION 
THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE VAGARIES OF THE WEATHER AND ENGULFED IN DARKNESS AT NIGHT 
MOST PEOPLE NEVER LEFT THEIR VILLAGE EXCEPT PERHAPS ON A ONCE IN A LIFETIME PILGRIMAGE 
TO SHRINES AT CITIES LIKE LINCOLN OR DERBY 
AFTER A FEARSOME TREK ACROSS COUNTRY 
A WEARY TRAVELLER ENTERING DERBY WOULD BE WELCOMED BY THIS REASSURING SITE A TRAVELLERS' BRIDGE CHAPEL 
THIS BRIDGE CHAPEL IS ONE OF JUST SIX THAT SURVIVE IN ENGLAND 
THEN THEY WERE BEACONS OF SAFETY GREETING TRAVELLERS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF AT LEAST FORTY MEDIEVAL TOWNS 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES THIS CHAPEL STOOD IN COMPLETE ISOLATION GUARDING THE BRIDGE THAT OFFERED 
THE ONLY PASSAGE OVER THE DERWENT AND INTO DERBY 
THE BRIDGE HAS LONG SINCE BEEN REBUILT 
ALONG WITH MUCH OF THE CHAPEL BUT IT STILL HAS SOME OF ITS ORIGINAL FEATURES 
THROUGH THAT HOLE IN THE WALL YOU CAN SEE THE PERMANENT LIGHT OF A CANDLE 
WHICH PASSERS BY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE AS THEY CROSSED THE BRIDGE 
IT'S CALLED A HAGIOSCOPE A HOLY VIEW AND THROUGH IT YOU CAN JUST ABOUT GLIMPSE THE HIGH ALTAR INSIDE 
AT NIGHT THE FLICKERING LIGHT OF THE CANDLE WOULD HAVE PENETRATED THE DARKNESS 
OFFERING OF COMFORT TO TRAVELLERS AS THEY CROSSED THE BRIDGE AN INVITATION TO COME INSIDE 
IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR TRAVELLERS CROSSING THIS BRIDGE TO PAUSE AT THIS POINT 
AND TO GIVE THANKS FOR THEIR ARRIVAL AND PRAY FOR A SAFE ONWARD JOURNEY 
YOU'D ALSO MAKE A SMALL DONATION TO PAY FOR THE UPKEEP OF THE BRIDGE 
AND TO PROVIDE FOOD AND DRINK FOR POOR TRAVELLERS 
INSIDE THE PRIEST WOULD SAY MASSES FOR THE PROTECTION OF TRAVELLERS 
AND FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE PERILOUS HIGHWAYS 
BUT THAT WASN'T ALL 
IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY THIS CHAPEL PLAYED HOST 
TO AN EXTRAORDINARY PRACTICE WHICH MIGHT SEEM TO US A LITTLE BIZARRE 
DOZENS OF MEDIEVAL CHAPELS HOUSED A SPIRITUAL HERMIT 
WHO'D SPEND THEIR ENTIRE LIFE ENCLOSED IN A STONE CELL 
KNOWN AS ANCHORITES THESE HERMITS WERE HIGHLY REVERED 
FOR DEMONSTRATING PIETY THROUGH EXTREME ABSTINENCE 
RECORDS REVEAL THAT THE BISHOP GRANTED PERMISSION FOR A CERTAIN AGNES WALLY 
TO BE ENCLOSED IN A STONE CELL WITHIN THE WALLS OF THIS CHAPEL 
SEALED UP IN HER STONE CELL HERE AGNES WITHDREW FROM THE WORLD 
TO LEAD A LIFE OF SOLITARY PRAYER AND CONTEMPLATION 
FOOD AND DRINK WOULD HAVE BEEN PASSED THROUGH A HOLE IN THE WALL TO HER BY AN ASSISTANT 
IT'S AMAZING TO THINK OF HER CONFINED IN HER AUSTERE CELL 
WITH THE BUSTLE OF THE TRAVELLERS JUST OUTSIDE ON THE BRIDGE 
MEDIEVAL TRAVELLERS WOULD HAVE CONSULTED AGNES AS A KIND OF ORACLE A FIGURE OF PIETY WHOSE WORDS 
OFFERED GREAT WISDOM AND COMFORT ON THE JOURNEY 
THE PROMISE OF A WARM FIRE HOT FOOD AND A REFRESHING ALE 
MEANT THAT YOUR FIRST STOP ON ARRIVAL WOULD PROBABLY BE THE LOCAL INN 
LIKE THIS ONE IN NOTTINGHAM 
ACCORDING TO LEGEND THERE'S BEEN A DRINKING ESTABLISHMENT ON THIS SITE 
AT THE FOOT OF THE HILLS BENEATH NOTTINGHAM CASTLE AT LEAST SINCE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE 
THAT MAKES IT A PRETTY GOOD CONTENDER FOR THE OLDEST PUB IN ENGLAND 
THE PUB'S NAME REFERS TO RICHARD I WHO RALLIED HIS KNIGHTS 
AT NOTTINGHAM BEFORE THEIR CRUSADE TO THE HOLY LAND 
THE MEDIEVAL CASTLE NO LONGER EXISTS BUT THE INN AT THE FOOT OF THE CLIFF REMAINS 
WHAT'S REALLY AMAZING ABOUT THIS PUB IS THE INSIDE 
ITS ROOMS GIVE WAY TO A NETWORK OF CAVES THAT HAVE BEEN CARVED RIGHT OUT OF THE ROCK 
THE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY REMAIN CONSTANT SO BEER IS STILL STORED HERE 
BUT IN THE MIDDLE AGES THESE UNIQUE CONDITIONS GAVE THE CAVES A VERY SPECIAL USE 
AS WELL AS FOR STORAGE THESE CAVES ARE THE IDEAL TEMPERATURE 
FOR BREWING AND ESPECIALLY FOR THE TRICKY PROCESS OF MALTING THE GRAIN 
SO THESE CAVES WERE THE IDEAL SPOT FOR THE MEDIEVAL CASTLE'S BREWHOUSE 
MALTING IS WHERE THEY WOULD SPREAD THE GRAINS OUT ON THE FLOOR 
PROBABLY LIKE IN THE CAVES HERE SO IT WOULD BE NICE AND COLD 
THEY'D RAISE THE MOISTURE LEVEL OF THE GRAIN TO ALLOW GERMINATION 
SO HOW LONG DO YOU LEAVE IT IN THE POT HERE OVER THE FIRE THAT WOULD BE LEFT IN 
FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF TWO HOURS 
JUST SIMMERING JUST TO LET THE SUGARS COME OUT INTO THE WATER 
AFTER THAT WE WILL SIEVE OUT THE BARLEY AND ADD THE BITTERING OR FLAVOURING AGENT 
FOR THIS PARTICULAR BREW WE ARE USING HYSSOP 
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN USED AMONGST OTHER HERBS 
AS A BITTERING AGENT BEFORE HOPS WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE BRITISH ISLES 
DO YOU MIND IF I TRY SOME NO GO AHEAD 
HMM 
IT'S QUITE BITTER AND QUITE GRASSY ISN'T IT 
SO THEY WOULD USE THIS INSTEAD OF HOPS 
YES THIS IS WHAT DIFFERENTIATES 
A MEDIEVAL ALE FROM TODAY'S BEER WHICH USES HOPS 
WE'LL BOIL THIS FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF THEN WE'RE READY TO GO ON TO THE FERMENTATION PROCESS 
AND SO HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE 
IF IT WAS LEFT TO FERMENT FOR ABOUT TWO DAYS 
THEN IT WOULD BE KNOWN AS SHORT ALE OR SMALL ALE 
AND THE ALCOHOL CONTENT WE THINK MIGHT BE ABOUT ONE AND A HALF TO TWO PER CENT 
THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE FAMILY WOULD DRINK THIS AS WE DRINK TEA OR COFFEE TODAY 
AND IT WAS ONE WAY OF ENSURING THAT YOU HAD A SAFE DRINK 
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T CONSIDER DRINKING THE WATER 
THE MAIN DRINK IN EVERY ENGLISH HOUSEHOLD ALE WAS AN ESSENTIAL 
THAT'S LOVELY 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN A NEW LAW EVEN RANKED IT ALONGSIDE BREAD AS A STAPLE IN THE MEDIEVAL DIET 
OH THAT IS REALLY DELICIOUS 
NOTTINGHAM'S BREWERS WERE IDEALLY PLACED TO EXPLOIT THE DEMAND 
IN MOST PLACES GRAIN COULD ONLY BE MALTED IN THE COOLEST MONTHS OF THE YEAR 
BUT IN THE CAVES IT COULD BE DONE ALL YEAR ROUND 
MALTING BECAME ONE OF THE CHIEF OCCUPATIONS IN THIRTEENTH CENTURY NOTTINGHAM EARNING THE CITY 
A NATIONWIDE REPUTATION FOR ITS ALE THE DRINK OF THE MEDIEVAL COMMONER 
I'M HEADING SOUTH TO WARWICKSHIRE WHERE A SCHEMING NOBLE 
INADVERTENTLY PAVED THE WAY FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE TO BE REPRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
TO KENILWORTH CASTLE 
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT RUINS OF MEDIEVAL ENGLAND 
ITS GREAT CENTRAL KEEP WAS A VIRTUAL CITADEL 
ENCLOSED WITHIN AN IMPREGNABLE WALL SURROUNDED BY A LAKE 
WHOEVER LIVED HERE BECAME A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH 
AND IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY IT CAME INTO THE HANDS OF A RUTHLESS ARISTOCRAT OF FRENCH DESCENT 
SIMON DE MONTFORT WAS A MAN WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY TALENT FOR SELF ADVANCEMENT 
ONE OF HIS MASTERSTROKES WAS TO MARRY ELEANOR THE SISTER OF THE KING 
BUT ELEANOR HAD TAKEN A VOW OF CHASTITY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING 
THE DEATH OF HER FIRST HUSBAND SO THEY HAD TO MARRY IN SECRET 
WHEN NEWS OF THE MARRIAGE GOT OUT IT CAUSED AN INTERNATIONAL SCANDAL 
DESPITE THE OUTRAGE THE KING MADE MONTFORT GOVERNOR OF KENILWORTH 
AND PRESENTED THIS CASTLE TO THE HAPPY COUPLE 
BUT SOON THINGS BEGAN TO GO WRONG 
FACED WITH FAMINE AND ECONOMIC DEPRESSION HENRY THE THIRD WAS LOSING POPULARITY 
THE OPPORTUNIST MONTFORT SAW HIS CHANCE TO GRAB THE THRONE AND IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT RALLIED FELLOW BARONS 
AGAINST THE KING IN THE CIVIL WAR THAT FOLLOWED HE CAPTURED HENRY AND SEIZED CONTROL OF THE NATION 
AS MONTFORT'S POWER GREW THE BARONS BECAME INCREASINGLY WARY OF HIM 
TO BOLSTER HIS FLAGGING SUPPORT IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE 
MONTFORT TOOK THE UNPRECEDENTED STEP OF SUMMONING LESSER KNIGHTS AND CITIZENS TO PARLIAMENT 
MONTFORT HAD NOT ENTIRELY WILLINGLY GIVEN COMMONERS A VOICE IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THEIR NATION 
IT WAS A PURELY SELFISH MOVE BUT IT HAD FAR REACHING CONSEQUENCES 
BY ALLOWING COMMONERS INTO PARLIAMENT MONTFORT HAD ESTABLISHED 
AN EXTRAORDINARY NEW PRECEDENT AND LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF DEMOCRACY IN ENGLAND 
BUT WITHIN MONTHS OF HIS FIRST PARLIAMENT MONTFORT WAS DEAD 
AN ARMY LED BY THE KING'S SON THE FUTURE EDWARD I 
SLAUGHTERED MONTFORT AND HIS MEN AT A BATTLE AT EVESHAM AND RESCUED THE KING 
THE ROYAL VICTORY AT EVESHAM WAS ABSOLUTE 
ONE CHRONICLER WROTE THAT IT WAS THE MURDER OF EVESHAM FOR BATTLE IT WAS NONE 
THE FIRST THAT MONTFORT'S SON LEARNED OF HIS FATHER'S FATE 
WAS WHEN HE SAW HIS HEAD MOUNTED ON A PIKE PARADED PAST HIM 
IRONICALLY WHEN HE CAME TO THE THRONE EDWARD I ACTUALLY ADOPTED MONTFORT'S IDEAS 
WHEN HE PROPOSED AND IMPLEMENTED HIS MODEL PARLIAMENT IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
AND IT WAS PROBABLY FOR THE KINGS OF ENGLAND 
THAT THE GOUGH MAP ITSELF WAS MADE AS A STATEMENT OF THEIR DOMINION 
THE GOUGH MAP SETS OUT AN IMAGE OF THE COUNTRY AS SEEN THROUGH ELITE EYES 
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO MEDIEVAL BRITAIN THAN THE GREAT LANDMARKS SHOWN HERE 
THE CITIES THE CASTLES THE CATHEDRALS 
JUST AS IMPORTANT IS WHAT IS ONLY GLIMPSED ON THE MAP THE FORESTS THE HAMLETS 
AND THE VILLAGES OF MEDIEVAL ENGLAND 
FOR THIS IS WHERE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE LIVED OUT THEIR LIVES
