NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAD HE SEEN A RIVER BEFORE 
A SLEEK SINUOUS FULL BODIED ANIMAL CHASING AND CHUCKLING 
GRIPPING THINGS WITH A GURGLE AND LEAVING THEM 
TO FLING ITSELF ON FRESH PLAYMATES THAT SHOOK THEMSELVES FREE 
THE MOLE WAS BEWITCHED ENTRANCED FASCINATED 
KENNETH GRAHAME'S THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS IS AS POPULAR TODAY AS EVER 
ITS ENDEARING CHARACTERS AND IDYLLIC WATERFRONT SETTING 
HAVE ENCHANTED GENERATIONS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS ALIKE 
GRAHAME WAS IN LOVE WITH THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
AND WOULD EXCHANGE HIS DESK AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND FOR THE BANKS OF THE THAMES AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE 
IN FRONT OF GRAHAME'S BOATHOUSE IS THIS GOLDEN WEEPING WILLOW 
ITS PROMINENCE HAS LED TO SPECULATION THAT IT IS THE VERY TREE 
THAT INSPIRED THE TITLE OF GRAHAME'S MUCH LOVED STORYBOOK 
THE VIEW FROM THE BOATHOUSE IS MAGICAL IT'S INSPIRING A NEW GENERATION 
I COME DOWN HERE AS OFTEN AS I CAN TO WRITE AND ALSO TO RELAX IT'S THE MOST PERFECT LOCATION 
I'M SURE THAT'S WHY KENNETH GRAHAME CHOSE IT TO STAY IN AND TO WRITE IN 
IT'S JUST GOT SUCH A MAGIC AND CHARM ABOUT IT 
WILLOWS GROW WELL ON A RIVERBANK BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN INVASIVE ROOT SYSTEM AND THEY LOVE WATER 
IT'S A GREAT SOURCE OF NUTRIENTS TO MAKE THEM GROW WELL 
IT'S GOT WONDERFUL BARK YOU ALMOST WANT TO HUG IT REALLY 
IT'S A LOVELY TREE AND IT LOOKS SO GOOD JUST DIPPING IN THE WATER 
THE GIRTH ON THIS IS QUITE LARGE I CAN'T HUG IT WITH TWO HANDS 
SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE EASILY WHEN HE WROTE WIND IN THE WILLOWS 
SUCH AN INSPIRATION FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL BOOK 
BUT WITH ALL THE OTHER BUILDINGS AROUND HERE YOU CAN'T SEE IT IN THE ORIGINAL SETTING 
THAT INSPIRED HIM TO PUT RAT BADGER AND MOLE HERE 
THE GOLDEN WEEPING WILLOW IS ONLY ONE OF NINETEEN VARIETIES OF THE TREE 
AND WHILST ITS ROLE IS PRIMARILY ORNAMENTAL 
ITS RELATIVES IN THE SALIX FAMILY PROVIDE THE KEY INGREDIENT OF ASPIRIN AND ALSO FINE CRICKET BATS 
THE ROMANTICISED TALE OF THE WILLOW'S ARRIVAL ON THE THAMES 
TELLS OF THE FIRST TREE BEING CULTIVATED FROM TWIGS USED AS PACKING IN A PARCEL SENT FROM SPAIN 
AND PLANTED IN TWICKENHAM BY THE POET AND AMATEUR GARDEN DESIGNER ALEXANDER POPE 
IN REALITY THE GOLDEN WEEPING WILLOW IS A HYBRID 
AND THIS SPECIMEN MAY WELL HAVE ORIGINATED FROM N. AMERICA 
RATHER THAN BABYLON OR CHINA AS IS OFTEN THOUGHT 
THIS TREE DIDN'T COME IN NATURALLY 
IT WAS A FASHIONABLE TREE TO PLANT 
WILLOWS TAKE VERY EASILY FROM CUTTINGS 
IT WAS PROBABLY JUST A BRANCH PUSHED INTO THE GROUND WHICH MAY HAVE TAKEN OFF FROM THAT 
IT SEEMS A FAIRLY HEALTHY TREE IT'S HAD ONE LIMB OFF IT 
THAT WAS PROBABLY MORE TO DO WITH WANTING TO REMOVE IT STRUCTURALLY FROM OVERHANGING NEARBY BUILDINGS 
BUT IT LOOKS VIGOROUS AND HEALTHY 
IT'S RATHER AN UNUSUAL TREE ACTUALLY 
THERE ARE OTHER POCKETS OF THIS TREE IN CHELTENHAM AND OVER IN ESSEX 
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT AS COMMON AS ONE WOULD IMAGINE 
IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE CRICKET BAT WILLOW IN THE NATURE OF THE WOOD 
A LARGE CRICKET BAT WILLOW WOULD HAVE VERY FISSURED BARK AS THIS WEEPING WILLOW HAS 
THE BOOK WIND IN THE WILLOWS DOES GIVE A STRONG FEELING OF COMMUNITY 
THE VARIOUS ANIMALS VISIT EACH OTHER IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE AREA 
THERE'S DEFINITELY THE FEELING OF A COMMUNITY NOT FAR AWAY FROM WHERE RATTY IS LIVING 
RATTY TALKS ABOUT ALL THE FRIENDS 
AND THE BANK ACTUALLY POSITIVELY BECOMING OVERCROWDED REALLY 
SO THERE'S A STRONG FEELING OF THE CHARACTERS BEING AMONG OTHER PEOPLE AND THINGS GOING ON AROUND THEM 
OFTEN WILLOWS ARE CULTIVATED BECAUSE OF THEIR STEM COLOUR DURING WINTER 
AND ON THIS PARTICULAR TREE YOU CAN SEE THE LOVELY GOLDEN YELLOW STEMS 
IT'S THE TREE FOR ALL SEASONS 
IN THE SUMMER IT'S WONDERFUL IT BLOWS IN THE WIND IT'S GENTLE 
IT'S VERY FENG SHUI WITH ITS SHAPE OF LEAF AND ITS FREE MOVEMENT 
WILLOW WAS REALLY BIG WHEN ALL THE WILLOW PATTERN WAS AROUND 
AND I GUESS IT'S SLIGHTLY RELATED TO CHINTZ FABRICS 
AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AROUND WHEN WE WERE PLANTING PAMPAS GRASSES IN THE SIXTIES 
MAYBE IT'S A TREE FOR US TO REVIVE GOING TOWARDS THE MILLENNIUM IT'D BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE IN BRITAIN'S EVER CHANGING LANDSCAPE 
THIS TREE'S PROVENANCE IS DIFFICULT TO CONFIRM 
BUT NOW BOTANY IS BEGINNING TO CAST DOUBT ON WHETHER THIS TREE COULD HAVE INSPIRED WIND IN THE WILLOWS 
I'M NOT SO SURE NOW THAT THIS IS THE TREE THE ACTUAL TREE 
I JUST DON'T FEEL THAT THE GIRTH OF THIS TREE IS SUFFICIENT 
TO MAKE IT AN OLD ENOUGH TREE TO BE THE ONE THAT INSPIRED GRAHAME 
THERE'S ONE WAY IN WHICH YOU COULD TELL ITS AGE AND THAT IS TO CUT IT DOWN AND COUNT THE AGE RINGS 
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO CHOP IT DOWN FOR YOU
