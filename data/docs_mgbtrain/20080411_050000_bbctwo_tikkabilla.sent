IT'S THE 
ARCHED WINDOW 
YOU PROBABLY KNEW THAT BIRDS LAY EGGS 
BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY DON'T JUST LAY THEIR EGGS IN NESTS 
THESE BIRDS ARE CALLED MALLEE FOWL 
AND THEY LAY THEIR EGGS IN THE SAND 
THEY DIG GREAT BIG PITS TO BURY THEM IN 
THE SAND HERE IS NICE AND WARM SO IT HELPS THE EGGS TO HATCH 
THESE BIRDS ARE SWIFTS 
AND THEY LAY THEIR EGGS SOMEWHERE VERY WET 
THEY LAY THEIR EGGS 
BEHIND A WATERFALL 
THEY HAVE TO FLY RIGHT THROUGH ALL THE WATER 
TO GET TO THEIR NEST 
WHAT A GREAT HIDING PLACE FOR THEIR EGGS THOUGH 
THESE FAIRY TERNS LAY THEIR EGGS RIGHT ON THE BRANCH 
AND HOPE THAT IT DOESN'T FALL OFF 
THE EGG IS NOT VERY WELL HIDDEN IS IT 
AND IT DOESN'T LOOK SAFE THERE AT ALL 
OH DEAR THOSE OTHER BIRDS HAVE KNOCKED IT OFF 
LAYING YOUR EGGS IN A NEST IS MUCH SAFER 
BECAUSE THEY'RE WELL PROTECTED AND THEY CAN'T FALL OUT 
LOTS OF OTHER ANIMALS LAY EGGS AS WELL 
THIS EGG IS JUST STARTING TO HATCH 
I WONDER WHAT IT IS 
IT'S A BABY CROCODILE 
CROCODILES LAY EGGS TOO 
MOSQUITOES LAY THEIR EGGS IN LITTLE RAFTS ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER 
THE MOTHER LOOKS AFTER THE EGGS 
UNTIL THEY'RE READY TO HATCH 
TREE FROGS LAY THEIR EGGS 
ON A LEAF UP IN THE TREES 
WHEN THEIR BABIES HATCH 
THE TADPOLES PLOP DOWN INTO THE POND 
AND THEN SWIM AWAY 
THESE RED CRABS ARE LAYING THEIR EGGS 
STRAIGHT INTO THE SEA 
ALL THE EGGS ARE STUCK ON THEIR TUMMIES 
SO THEY HAVE TO JUMP UP AND DOWN 
TO WASH THEM AWAY IN THE WATER 
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE DANCING 
THIS MOTH IS LAYING LOTS OF TINY EGGS 
ON A BRANCH ROUND AND ROUND SHE GOES 
COVERING THE BRANCH IN EGGS 
YOU MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT BIRDS LAY EGGS 
BUT NOW YOU KNOW THAT MOTHS LAY EGGS 
FROGS LAY EGGS 
CRABS LAY EGGS 
AND EVEN CROCODILES LAY EGGS TOO
