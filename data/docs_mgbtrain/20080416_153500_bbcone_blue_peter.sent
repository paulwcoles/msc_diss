HELLO NOW WE KNOW THAT YOU LOVE YOUR FASHION 
AND TODAY WE HAVE LIVING PROOF OF THAT 
BECAUSE ANDY AND I ARE WEARING SOME OF YOUR DESIGNS 
GO WORK IT ON THAT CATWALK ANDY 
NOW ANDY IS SPORTING AN OUTFIT WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNED 
BY EMMA FROM SAINT ALBANS EMMA THERE IS YOUR ORIGINAL DESIGN 
AND WE LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE 
COS YOU SAID IN YOUR LETTER THAT ANDY'S SUCH A SMILEY HAPPY PERSON 
THAT YOU WANTED TO PUT THE SUNSHINE ON HIS TOP 
AND THAT YELLOW WAS JUST HIS COLOUR 
SO WE THINK IT LOOKS GREAT I'M LOVING IT 
ZOE IS WEARING A DESIGN BY CHARLOTTE 
IN ELY 
SHE SENT IN A BOOK OF DESIGNS SHE'D LIKE TO MAKE WHEN SHE'S OLDER 
SHE SAID SHE'D CALL HER FASHION BRAND C. S. FABULOUS 
FABULOUS I SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE THERE 
YOU'VE PUT YOUR INITIALS IN THE NAME OF YOUR BRAND 
HOPEFULLY FINGERS CROSSED BY THE END OF THE SHOW 
I'LL BE WEARING AN OUTFIT WHICH HAS BEEN CREATED AND DESIGNED 
BY MY OWN VERY FAIR HANDS 
IT WAS A CHALLENGE SET BY A TOP FASHION DESIGNER 
WHO HAS SEEN HIS OUTFITS SHOWN ON CATWALKS ALL OVER THE WORLD 
DESIGNER GARY HARVEY IS CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE PIONEERS 
IN RECYCLED FASHION DESIGN 
HE FIRST BECAME INTERESTED IN RECYCLING WHEN HE WAS AT COLLEGE 
AND COULDN'T AFFORD TO BUY FABRICS 
ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF HIS CAREER 
WAS SHOWING HIS DESIGNS AT LONDON FASHION WEEK 
HERE HE IS GARY WELCOME TO THE STUDIO 
THANK YOU YOU ARE FAMOUS FOR 
CREATING OUTFITS MADE OUT OF RECYCLED MATERIALS 
SO YOU'RE VERY WORTHY OF YOUR GREEN BADGE 
WHAT THINGS DO YOU USE IN CREATING THOSE DESIGNS 
I LIKE TO TAKE EVERYDAY OBJECTS 
THE JEANS 
EVERYDAY NORMAL WEAR YEAH 
THEN I TAKE THEM AND CREATE FORTY TWO PAIRS INTO A BEAUTIFUL BALL GOWN OH 
AND THERE IT IS 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
I'D LOVE TO WEAR THAT OUT SHOPPING 
TALKING OF SHOPPING 
A SHOPPING BAG YOU CAN BUY ON ANY HIGH STREET IN THE U. K. 
PLASTIC BUT I'VE TURNED IT INTO A BALL GOWN 
USING THE BAGS AS A SKIRT AND THE STRAPS WOVEN TO MAKE A CORSET WOW 
SOMETHING THAT YOU'D USUALLY PUT CLOTHES INTO 
YOU'VE TRANSFORMED INTO CLOTHES ABSOLUTELY 
AND THEN 
NEWSPAPER 
SOMETHING YOU WOULDN'T NORMALLY WEAR 
SCRUMPLED UP AND CREATE INTO A BIG SKIRT 
WOW YOU REALLY DO THINK OF EVERYTHING 
AMAZING WELL WE DO LOVE A BIT OF RECYCLING ON THE SHOW 
SO MY CHALLENGE TODAY IS TO CREATE A RECYCLED PIECE OF FASHION 
SO I HAVE DECIDED TO USE LOTS AND LOTS OF TOPS THERE WE GO 
I'VE CUT THEM ALL UP 
AND HOPEFULLY INSPIRED BY YOUR COLLECTION GARY 
I'LL BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A BALL GOWN OF MY OWN 
CAN YOU STAY AND HELP ME MAKE MY DESIGN CATWALK WORTHY 
ABSOLUTELY GREAT I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY THAT 
I HOPE YOU GET THAT DRESS DONE BY THE END OF THE SHOW SO DO I ANDY 
A LOT OF YOU MIGHT KNOW I'VE GOT A BIT OF A HEIGHT PHOBIA 
SO I WAS HAPPY WHEN THE CHALLENGE 
OF BEING SUSPENDED BY TWO THIN WIRES TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR METRES IN THE AIR 
WENT TO GETHIN UNLUCKY MATE 
AS A BLUE PETER PRESENTER I GET TO DO A LOT OF EXCITING STUFF 
AND SOME FRIGHTENING THINGS AS WELL 
SO WHEN THEY TOLD ME MY NEXT CHALLENGE WAS CLEANING WINDOWS 
I THOUGHT BRILLIANT CLEAN UP ON THIS ONE 
GOT MY LADDER BUCKET NO PROBLEM 
THEN THEY SHOWED ME THE WINDOWS I'D BE CLEANING 
COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE CANARY WHARF TOWER 
ONE CANADA SQUARE IS BRITAIN'S TALLEST BUILDING 
IT'S HOME TO MANY LEADING BUSINESSES 
HAS FIFTY FLOORS AND STANDS AT A WHOPPING TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR METRES 
WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF STANDING FIFTY SEVEN DOUBLE DECKER BUSES 
ON TOP OF EACH OTHER 
THE BUILDING IS SO HIGH 
THAT ON A CLEAR DAY IT CAN BE SEEN UP TO THIRTY FIVE MILES AWAY 
IT EVEN HAS ITS OWN WARNING LIGHT TO STOP AIRCRAFT HITTING THE TOWER 
WHICH FLASHES FORTY TIMES A MINUTE 
THAT'S FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND TIMES A DAY 
INSTEAD OF LADDERS THE WINDOW CLEANERS USE CRADLES 
WHICH RUN DOWN THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING 
BUT TO GET TO THE CRADLES YOU NEED TO GO TO THE VERY TOP OF THE TOWER 
THERE ARE THIRTY SIX LIFTS IN THE TOWER 
AND WHILST IT TAKES THE WINDOW CLEANING CRADLES FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
TO GET FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM 
THAT SAME JOURNEY TAKES ABOUT FORTY SECONDS IN THIS LIFT 
WHICH IS THE SAME TIME IT'S TAKEN ME TO TELL YOU THIS 
I THINK I LEFT MY STOMACH ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
NOW ON THE ROOF 
IT WAS TIME TO MEET PAUL ONE OF THE TOWER'S WINDOW CLEANERS 
PAUL GETHIN HOW YOU GOING WELCOME TO NUMBER ONE CANADA SQUARE 
A WARM WELCOME AS WELL LET'S GET YOU KITTED UP 
YOUR HARD HAT HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS FIVE YEARS 
I CAN TRUST YOU YEAH NO INCIDENTS 
THERE'S A SAFETY WIRE PUT YOUR LEGS THROW THESE TWO HOLES 
AND THAT ONE THROUGH THERE 
DON'T KNOW WHY I'M SMILING I'M ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED 
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING IN YEAH THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING IN 
IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG BUCKET 
IS IT SAFE SAFE AS HOUSES A STUPID QUESTION BUT I NEED TO HEAR YOU 
EVERYONE DOES ONCE YOU'RE IN YOU'LL BE FINE 
WERE YOU NERVOUS THE FIRST TIME 
I WAS VERY NERVOUS THE FIRST TIME 
I'VE WORKED ON A COUPLE OF BUILDINGS OVER THERE 
BUT THE FIRST TIME ON THIS ONE I WAS NERVOUS 
WHAT'S THE WORST BIT GOING OVER THE EDGE I THINK 
COS WHEN YOU FIRST GO OVER THE EDGE AND YOU SEE THAT SHEER DROP 
IT TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY I'M GONNA STOP TALKING 
CAN YOU FEEL THAT YEAH FEEL SAFE 
CAN I HAVE A QUICK LOOK OVER BEFORE WE GO YEAH GO ON 
LONG WAY DOWN 
FELT ALL RIGHT UNTIL I DID THAT 
I WISH I'D STAYED ON THE GROUND FLOOR WITH MY STOMACH 
STILL FEEL QUEASY FROM THAT LIFT 
EXHALES 
WINDOW CLEANING IT'S JUST WINDOW CLEANING 
BUT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE AND THAT DIFFERENCE IS 
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR METRES HIGH 
I TRUST YOU PAUL YEAH MILLIONS WOULDN'T 
COME ON 
DESPITE ALL THE SAFETY GEAR 
MY NERVES WERE REALLY STARTING TO KICK IN 
OH OH 
OH OH 
I DO NOT FEEL GOOD 
I'VE WORKED OUT IF I STAY AT EYELEVEL IT'S FINE 
IT'S WHEN I LOOK DOWN THERE'S A PROBLEM 
WILL MY HOPES OF COMPLETING THIS CHALLENGE DISAPPEAR IN THE CLOUDS 
OH I DON'T LIKE THIS BIT AT ALL 
WILL MY NERVES BE GIVEN A HIGH RISE LIFT 
HELLO HOW ARE YOU 
WE'LL SEE HOW GETHIN GETS ON A LITTLE LATER 
WILL THOSE WINDOWS BE CLEAN WHO KNOWS 
TODAY INTERNATIONAL FASHION DESIGNER GARY HARVEY 
HAS SET ZOE AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY FASHION CHALLENGE 
SHE'S TO MAKE A DRESS OUT OF OLD TOPS 
ZOE HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON 
WELL NOT TOO BAD THANKS ANDY 
I'VE HAD TO PREPARE FOR THIS FOR QUITE AWHILE 
LAST WEEK I WENT OUT TO CHARITY SHOPS TO COLLECT MY TOPS 
THERE I AM SHOPPING FOR LOTS OF PINKS AND PURPLES 
I WANTED IT TO BE A NICE CINDERELLA THEME 
SO NICE AND GIRLY AND I WANTED TO CREATE A BIG BALL GOWN 
SO I TOOK ALL THE TOPS BACK 
AND I CUT THEM UP INTO LONG PIECES 
THAT I THEN ATTACHED TO THAT DRESS 
AND WHICH I'VE NOW GOT ON THIS MANNEQUIN 
ON THE DRESS I'VE PUT LOOPS SO I CAN THEN ATTACH 
THE BIG LONG TOPS I'VE CUT UP 
GARY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE LOOPS I'VE ATTACHED 
PERFECT IT DOESN'T INVOLVE TOO MUCH SEWING 
AND YOU CAN TIE YOUR FABRIC ON 
TWO THINGS YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR 
IT'S NOT TOO HEAVY SO YOU CAN WALK IN IT M. M. M. 
AND IT'S NOT TOO LONG AT THE FRONT WE DON'T WANT YOU FALLING OVER 
THAT'D BE A DISASTER A REAL NAOMI CAMPBELL MOMENT 
IF YOU DO WANT TO TRY MAKING YOUR OWN CREATIONS AT HOME 
MAKE SURE IF YOU'RE GOING TO CUT SOMETHING UP 
THAT YOU ASK YOUR PARENTS' PERMISSION 
I DID CUT UP ONE OF MY MUM'S DRESSES 
DIDN'T ASK FIRST AND I'M STILL SORRY ABOUT THAT MUM 
I HOPE WE GET THIS FINISHED 
WE'LL SEE IF ZOE'S GOT AN EYE FOR FASHION A LITTLE LATER ON 
BUT FIRST WE'VE REACHED 
ONE OF THE TOUGHEST LETTERS ON OUR A Z. OF WEIRD ANIMALS 
WHY DO I ALWAYS GET THE HARD ONES 
A SMALL GAME BIRD 
WEIRD NO NOT WEIRD ENOUGH 
AN AUSTRALIAN MARSUPIAL A BIT LIKE A SMALL KANGAROO 
WEIRD NAME BUT NOT WEIRD ENOUGH 
QUOL FROM DOWN UNDER AN AGGRESSIVE MEAT EATER WITH WHITE SPOTS 
AND A RELATIVE OF THE TASMANIAN DEVIL 
STILL NOT STRANGE ENOUGH 
GOT IT 
LETTER Q. STANDS FOR QUITE A LOT SURPRISINGLY 
INCLUDING THE QUETZAL BIRD 
FROM THE TROPICAL FORESTS 
OF CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA 
IF YOU CAME ACROSS ONE OF THESE COLOURFUL CREATURES IN THE FOREST 
YOU'D DEFINITELY BE IN FOR A SURPRISE THE JEWEL OF THE JUNGLE 
MUST BE ONE OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR LOOKING BIRDS AROUND 
DURING THE MATING SEASON MALE QUETZALS GIVE THEMSELVES 
A STYLISH NEW LOOK BY GROWING TWIN TAIL FEATHERS UP TO A METRE LONG 
THIS EXTRAVAGANT HAIRDO IS DESIGNED 
TO ATTRACT QUETZALS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX SHOW OFFS 
IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY OF GUATEMALA 
THEY LOVE THE QUETZALS SO MUCH 
AS WELL AS CHOOSING IT AS THEIR NATIONAL BIRD 
THEY'VE NAMED THEIR MONEY AFTER IT THAT'S TWO QUETZAL FIFTY PLEASE 
THE QUETZALS' FAVOURITE FOOD IS WILD AVOCADO 
WHICH THEY SWALLOW WHOLE WITHOUT TAKING THE STONE OUT 
AND THAT'S THE QUETZAL BIRD 
A COOL CUSTOMER AND 
NOT A BAD SCORE ON THE BOARD EITHER 
RIGHT WHERE IS THE QUETZAL GONNA GO ON OUR WALL OF WEIRD 
WELL I'VE MADE THE DECISION ALREADY 
LOOK AT THOSE FEATHERS VERY COLOURFUL 
LOOK AT THAT BEAUTIFUL FACE WHO COULD RESIST 
I RECKON IT'S GONNA GO HERE NEXT TO THE MEERKAT 
O. K. ZOE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S BEEN GETTING INTO RECYCLING FASHION 
I'LL JUST PEER THROUGH HERE BECAUSE ELLIE IN HERTFORDSHIRE 
HAS ENTERED A RECYCLING COMPETITION 
AND SHE MADE A DRESS OUT OF OLD SHEETS AMAZING 
IF THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH HER FRIENDS GRACE AND LUCY 
ALSO MADE STUFF OUT OF OLD PLASTIC BAGS AND CRISP PACKETS 
GARY LOOK AT THESE DESIGNS 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON IT'S AMAZING TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE TAKING STUFF 
THAT'S AVAILABLE IN THEIR HOUSE AND USING THEIR ARTISTIC TALENTS 
TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING BRAND NEW ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT YOURSELF A BLUE BADGE AND A SILVER BADGE 
AND BECAUSE YOU WERE VERY ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY ELLIE 
YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF A GREEN BADGE 
YOU GUYS AT HOME CAN ALSO GET A GREEN BADGE

OR CONSERVATION THAT'S AMAZING 
THERE ARE LOADS OF BADGES ON THE WEBSITE AS WELL

TO SAY THANK YOU PROPERLY I'M GONNA AWARD YOU WITH A BLUE PETER BADGE 
NOW I KNOW YOU WERE EXPECTING SOMETHING THROUGH THE POST 
BUT HOW WAS A VISIT FROM ME INSTEAD 
EVEN BETTER QUALITY GIVE HER A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
WHEN GETHIN CAME IN IT WAS A BIT WEIRD 
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AT THAT POINT 
IT WAS A BIT FREAKY 
OUT OF TEN FOR EXCITEMENT I'D GIVE IT A TEN 
SEE THAT'S ALL IT TAKES SEND US A LETTER 
AND WE COULD BE POPPING ROUND TO SAY HELLO TO YOU NOW HOPEFULLY 
ZOE SHOULD BE ALMOST FINISHED ON HER RECYCLING DRESS 
HOW ARE YOU DOING MATE REALLY WELL 
I'M SURPRISED HOW MUCH I'VE GOT ONTO THE DRESS 
SO I'M TAKING A BREAK FROM THAT TO DRESS UP THE TOP PART OF IT 
BECAUSE GARY'S COME UP WITH A GOOD IDEA 
OF PUTTING A CORSAGE ON THE TOP WHICH IS BASICALLY 
A NICE FABRIC FLOWER SO GARY TALK US THROUGH 
HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT WHAT YOU DO GET FIVE OR SIX CIRCLES 
OF A PIECE OF FABRIC YOU HAVE LYING AROUND AT HOME 
PUT A SIMPLE STITCH RUNNING THROUGH THE FIVE CIRCLES 
PULL THE TWO ENDS OF THE COTTON TIGHT AND TIE THEM IN A KNOT 
THEN YOU CAN DECORATE IT WITH A SINGLE BUTTON OR BEADS 
OR ANYTHING YOU HAVE LYING AROUND 
AND A SMALL PIN ON THE BACK RECYCLE EVEN MORE WHATEVER'S LYING AROUND 
PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE WELL 
I'VE GOT MINE AND I'M JUST PUTTING IT TOGETHER NOW 
IF YOU DO WANT ALL THE DETAILS 
OF HOW TO MAKE THIS 
YOU CAN GET ON THE WEBSITE AND MAKE YOUR OWN 
SEND US A PICTURE OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE 
GARY HAVE YOU GOT ANY OTHER RECYCLING FASHION TIPS FOR US 
YES I HAVE I'VE GOT THREE 
SKINNY JEANS 
THE TIGHT LEG FITTED LOOK 
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR OLD JEANS THE BOOT CUT THE BAGGY FIT 
WORK WITH AN ADULT AND THEY CAN HELP YOU 
TAKE THEM IN SO THEY'RE TIGHTER ON YOUR LEG 
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY A NEW PAIR 
YOU CAN RECYCLE AN OLD PAIR THAT'S AMAZING I LOVE SKINNY JEANS 
BUT I'VE GOT SO MANY BOOT CUTS THAT I DON'T WEAR 
SO I CAN CUT OFF THE BOTTOM AND HEY PRESTO 
WHAT'S YOUR NEXT ONE 
THE OTHER ONE IS TO TAKE YOUR OLD WARDROBE 
PUT IT IN THE WASHING MACHINE WITH A DYE 
AND THEN DYE IT A NEW COLOUR 
YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE NEW LOOK 
WOW THAT IS A GOOD IDEA 
ANYTHING ELSE THE THIRD AND FINAL ONE IS CUSTOMISATION 
TAKE YOUR OLD FAVOURITE T. SHIRT 
THEN PUT SOME GRAFFITI OR A NUMBER OR YOUR INITIAL 
IN FABRIC PENS OR IN APPLIQUE FABRIC 
OR PATCHES THAT YOU CAN JUST IRON ON 
OR JUST DRAW ON A SMALL MOTIF 
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE THERE 
AND LOOKING AT FLOWERS I'VE FINISHED MY VERY OWN ONE 
LET'S GO AND ATTACH IT TO THE DRESS I'VE PUT A SAFETY PIN ON THE BACK 
SO I CAN PUT IT ON LIKE A BLUE PETER BADGE 
THERE WE GO ON THE OTHER SIDE WE'VE ALREADY GOT A BADGE 
READY TO SLIP IT ON 
THAT LOOKS REALLY NICE I LIKE THE TIPS ABOUT RECYCLING 
AND PUTTING PRINTS ON 
LET'S HOPE YOU GET THIS DONE IN TIME TO DON IT ON THE CATWALK ZOE 
YEAH BUT FIRST 
LET'S SEE HOW GETHIN GETS ON CLEANING THE WINDOWS 
OF THE U. K.'S TALLEST BUILDING CHECK THIS OUT 
I'VE BEEN BROUGHT UP TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR METRES 
TO THE TOP OF THE U. K.'S TALLEST BUILDING ONE CANADA SQUARE 
WORKING WITH PAUL I WAS GOING OUT IN THE CRADLES 
FOR A SPOT OF EXTREME WINDOW CLEANING 
MY NERVES WERE ALREADY KICKING IN AND WHAT I DIDN'T REALISE 
WAS THAT HAVING LEFT THE TOP OF THE BUILDING 
THE CRADLE HAD TO MOVE EVEN FURTHER FROM IT TO LOCK INTO THE RUNNERS 
WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO MOVE DOWN I WASN'T HAPPY 
WHOA 
THAT'S SO WEIRD 
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK DOWN 
BUT YOU CAN SEE THE REFLECTION OF THE HEIGHT 
OH 
THAT'S NOT NICE O. K. 
I'M IN LINE YEAH GO 
O. K. I'M GOOD 
THIS IS A MASSIVE CHALLENGE FOR ME 
AND YET THIS IS PAUL'S DAY JOB 
ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE READY TO CLEAN 
YEP IF YOU'RE READY THEN WE'LL GO 
THE GOOD THING IS ABOUT THIS I LOVE CLEANING 
AND I ESPECIALLY LOVE CLEANING WINDOWS 
SO IF I CONCENTRATE ON THE WINDOW 
I'LL FORGET ABOUT THE HEIGHT 
SHOW ME THE TECHNIQUE ALL RIGHT 
UP THROUGH THE SIDE 
ROUND THE TOP DOWN THE OTHER SIDE AND UP AGAIN 
AND JUST ROUND 
I LOVE IT I USED TO DO A BIT OF WINDOW CLEANING 
YEAH YEAH HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE YOU TO DO A SIDE ABOUT FIVED AYS 
JUST ONE SIDE YEAH IT TAKES A MONTH TO GO ROUND THE WHOLE BUILDING 
THEN ONCE WE'VE FINISHED THAT WE START AGAIN 
NEVER TAKE YOUR SQUEEGEE OFF THE GLASS TILL YOU'VE FINISHED 
BRING IT ALL THE WAY DOWN 
HELLO HOW ARE YOU DOING 
I'M SORRY IF I'M TALKING A LOT BUT IF I GO QUIET I REALISE 
I'M QUITE HIGH YEAH WHOA 
THAT'S NOT NICE WHEN YOU LOOK DOWN THERE 
DID YOU LOOK DOWN IT'S NOT SO GOOD 
OH HANG ON 
SORRY I HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET 
I'M NOT AS QUICK AS YOU 
HAVE YOU EVER HAD AN INCIDENT THE CRADLE BREAKS DOWN 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
THE POWER GOES TO THE SYSTEM 
WHAT HAPPENS THEN YOU CALL MAINTENANCE 
MAINTENANCE COME UP AND FIX IT 
WHILE YOU'RE WAITING SO YOU'RE JUST STUCK THERE STUCK THERE 
YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT 
TALLEST BUILDING IN BRITAIN YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY OF TODAY 
UP TO DATE IT'D BE ALL MACHINERY 
REALLY CLEVER STUFF BUT ACTUALLY IT'S A BUCKET 
WASHING UP LIQUID IN A BOWL UP AND DOWN THE TALLEST BUILDING 
ANDY WOULD ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS 
IN FACT NOW I'M FEELING A BIT BETTER I WISH HE WAS HERE 
SO I COULD TAKE THE MICK OUT OF HIM 
YOU WEREN'T SAYING THAT AT THE BEGINNING I KNOW BRAVE NOW 
HAVING THOUGHT I FELT MORE AT EASE MY NERVES WERE SHAKEN AGAIN' 
IT WAS ALL O. K. 
THE CRADLE SHAKING WAS JUST IT MOVING BETWEEN DIFFERENT SECTIONS 
OF THE RUNNERS' WILL YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT CRIKEY 
PHEW 
HOW MANY WINDOWS HAVE YOU EVER COUNTED THEM 
I THINK THERE'S OVER FOUR THOUSAND PANES OF GLASS THERE 
FOUR THOUSAND WINDOWS 
NEVER ENDING WOW 
EVEN THOUGH I HAVE MY PILOT'S LICENCE 
I DON'T LIKE HEIGHTS WHEN I'M NOT IN CONTROL THANKFULLY 
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WORKING IN THE BUILDING HELPED DISTRACT ME 
FROM JUST HOW HIGH I WAS' 
THEY JUST HAD A LITTLE DANCE IN THERE 
I GAVE THEM SIX OUT OF TEN THEY WERE FURIOUS 
IT TOOK AN HOUR TO REACH THE BOTTOM OF THE TOWER 
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL OVER I HAD ONE MORE SURPRISE 
HOW'S THAT 
CLEAN WINDOWS CAN WE GO DOWN NOW 
I'M AFRAID NOT 
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GO BACK OUT IS BY GOING BACK TO THE TOP 
THAT'S A JOKE RIGHT 
NO WAY 
IT TOOK ANOTHER HOUR TO GO BACK TO THE TOP 
I'D FORGOTTEN HOW SCARED I WAS UP THERE 
OH DON'T LOOK AT THE REFLECTION 
OH I DON'T LIKE THIS BIT AT ALL 
THAT'S HORRIBLE 
IT'S GONNA BE O. K. 
IT'S GONNA BE FINE 
IF I LEAN NOTHING CAN HAPPEN NOW 
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE 
IT'S LIKE A SLOW EXTREME SPORT 
AS YOU KNOW I HATE ROLLER COASTERS 
I QUITE LIKE SOME EXTREME SPORTS BUT THE THING IS WITH THOSE THINGS 
THEY'RE OVER IN A FLASH 
THEY JUST HAPPEN YOU DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT THEM 
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS YOU'RE SUSPENDED FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF 
SO YOU'VE GOT LOADS OF THINKING TIME 
YOU'RE TOTALLY AWARE OF YOUR HEIGHT AT ALL TIMES 
AND THAT'S WHEN IT GETS A BIT FRIGHTENING 
BUT THOSE WINDOWS ARE CLEAN 
WELL DONE GETH THAT WAS A PRETTY TOUGH CHALLENGE 
ON TODAY'S SHOW ZOE HAS BEEN TRYING HER HAND AS A FASHION DESIGNER 
HER TASK WAS TO MAKE A DRESS OUT OF RECYCLED TOPS 
AND SHE WAS WATCHED BY INTERNATIONAL FASHION DESIGNER GARY HARVEY 
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ZOE SALMON COME ON DOWN 
AND HERE SHE IS THE FAIRY TALE PRINCESS 
RAGS TO RICHES STORY OF CINDERELLA

SALMON COUTURE 
SALMON COUTURE 
ARE YOU PLEASED BE HONEST 
I AM QUITE IMPRESSED BECAUSE I LOVE THE WAY 
IT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND I DID CREATE IT ALL MYSELF 
SO I'M QUITE PLEASED 
AND ALSO APART FROM THE CORSAGE WHICH GARY INSPIRED ME TO DO 
I CUT UP THE TOP AND I USED THE SLEEVES AS GLOVES 
WHAT DO YOU THINK COOL 
IS THERE ANY WAY SHE COULD TWEAK THIS 
NO THIS IS PERFECT FOR GOING OUT IN THE EVENING 
SHE CAN GO TO A RED CARPET EVENT SOME SORT OF OPENING 
A REALLY GOOD EVENING OCCASION 
KEEPING WITH THE THEME OF RECYCLING SHE CAN TAKE IT HOME 
CUT IT AT THE KNEE WEAR IT AS A SUMMER DRESS 
WITH FLIP FLOPS DOWN THE HIGH STREET 
THAT'S AMAZING IF THERE WAS ANY FASHION TIP YOU COULD GIVE ANYONE 
A KEY THING TO REMEMBER WHAT WOULD IT BE 
GO HOME HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR WARDROBE 
AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN RECYCLE
