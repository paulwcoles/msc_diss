THANK YOU 
PUPILS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY 
SOME OF THEM PREPARING FOR EXAMS 
HAVE BEEN FORCED TO TAKE THE DAY 
OFF BECAUSE OF THE FIRST NATIONAL 
TEACHERS' STRIKE IN TWO DECADES 
MANY OF THEIR PARENTS HAVE BEEN OFF 
WORK TOO AT HOME LOOKING AFTER 
THEIR CHILDREN IT IS THOUGHT 
TODAY'S WALKOUT BY TEACHERS 
DISRUPTED UP TO EIGHT THOUSAND SCHOOLS THAT 
IS ONE IN THREE AT LEAST ONE 
MILLION PUPILS DID NOT HAVE LESSONS 
N. A MOMENT JAMES WESTHEAD ON WHY 
TEACHERS HAVE BEEN STRIKING FIRST 
OUR REPORTERS HAVE LOOKED AT THE 
DISRUPTION H. DISRUPTION H. HERE IN WALES MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED SCHOOLS 
HAVE BEEN HIT BY THE STRIKE THAT 
IS FIFTY PER CENT OF OUR SCHOOLS IN WALES FROM 
NORTH TO SOUTH PUPILS HAVE BEEN 
ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE NUT WALK 
OUT SOME SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED ALL 
TOGETHER OTHERS LIKE THIS ONE IN 
CARDIFF REMAIN PARTIALLY OPEN AS 
YOU CAN SEE THESE PUPILS ARE STILL 
BEING TAUGHT TODAY ACROSS THE 
SOUTH WEST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN 
CLOSED OR DISRUPTED IT MASS MEANT 
A VERY BUSY DAY INDEED HERE IN 
PLYMOUTH AT PLAY CENTRES LIKE THIS 
ONE AROUND FOUR HUNDRED TEACHERS HAVE 
BROUGHT THIS PART OF MANCHESTER TO 
A STANDSTILL TODAY AROUND FIVE HUNDRED 
SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED ACROSS THE 
NORTH WEST AS FOR THE FUTURE 
TEACHERS HERE SAID THEY WOULD 
STRIKE AGAIN 
THE NUT SAYS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT 
PAY RISE IT WILL BECOME DIFFICULT 
TO RECRUIT AND RETRAIN RETAIN 
STAFF 
THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLS CLOSED FOR THE 
DAY NORMALLY BUSY CLASSROOMS EMPTY 
OVER ONE MILLION PUPILS STAYED HOME 
THEIR TEACHERS OUT ON STRIKE IN 
WHAT MAY BE THE BIGGEST DISRUPTION 
IN A GENERATION FOR SCHOOLS AND 
PARENTS 
THEY ARE NOT THINKINGANT PARENTS SINGLE PARENTS THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO 
TAKE TIME OFF WORK THEY ARE JUST 
THINKING ABOUT THEMSELVES 
I HAVE 
TWO KIDS WE HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE 
TO LOOK AFTER THEM DURING THE DAY 
MANY SCHOOLS LIKE THIS ONE IN ESSEX 
MANAGED TO STAY OPEN BY COMBINING 
CLASSES SOME PUPILS NOW PREPARING 
FOR GCSES A LEVELS OR S. A. T.'S THE 
STRIKE COULD NOT HAVE COME AT 
WORSE TIME 
AS MUCH AS THEY HAVE 
RIGHT TO GO ON STRIKE SWRE THE 
RIGHT TO HAVE AN EDUCATION 
I HAVE 
NOT HAD MUCH RESPECT FOR TEACHERS 
I THINK THEY DESERVE THE PAY RISE 
FEWER THAN HALF OF TEACHERS BELONG 
TO THE NATIONAL UNION WHICH IS 
STAGING THE STRIKE MEMBERS OF THE 
NUT WERE DEFIANT THOUSANDS MARCHED 
THROUGH CENTRAL LONDON TO SHOW 
THEIR FEELINGS 
THEY ACCEPT PAY AS IMPROVED 
RECENTLY THEY ARGUE IT HAS BEEN 
EATEN AWAY BY LIVING COSTS WE WE DEZER FAIR PAY WE WORK IN THE 
PUBLIC SECTOR WE DESERVE TO BE 
PAID ABOVE THE RATE OF INFLATION I I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GO ON STRIKE 
WE HAVE BEEN LEFT WITH NO CHOICE 
WE ARE FIGHTING IN THE LONG RUN FOR 
EDUCATION FOR BETTER EDUCATION 
FOR OUR CHILDREN 
DESPITE THE 
STRENGTH OF FEELING THE TEACHING 
PROFESSION AS A WHOLE IS FAR FROM 
UNITED OVER THIS STRIKE ACTION 
MAKING CONCESSIONS UNLIKELY 
AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW RECOMMENDED A 
PAY RISE OF JUST UNDER TWENTY FIVE PER CENT THE 
NUT WANT FORTY ONE WHICH THEY SAY IS THE 
RATE OF INFLATION WHAT DOES AN 
AVERAGE TEACHER GET THIRTY THOUSAND 
THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND AFTER SIX YEARS BUT A GOOD 
FINAL SALARY PENSION AND OF COURSE 
LONGER HOLIDAYS THAN MOST 
POLITICIANS ACROSS THE BOARD 
CONDEMN THE STRIKE WHICH MINISTERS 
ARGUE IS UNJUSTIFIABLE 
I THINK 
PARENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WILL BE 
ANNOYED AND INDEED ANGRY TO SEE 
SCHOOLS BEING CLOSED TODAY L. THINK 
MANY TEACHERS WILL FEEL THE SAME 
THING TOO L. SHARE THEIR FRUSTRATION 
THE YES NOW THE FRUSTRATION QUESTION NOW IS THIS THE END OF 
JUST THE BEGINNING THE NUT WILL 
DECIDE NEXT MONTH WHETHER THERE IS 
APPETITE AMONG ITS MEMBERS FOR A 
SUMMER OF DISRUPTION 
SO JUST HOW MUCH DISRUPTION DID 
THE TEACHERS' STRIKE CAUSE FOR 
FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES TODAY OUR 
CORRESPONDENT FOUND OUT IN WEST 
YORKSHIRE YORKSHIRE A DAY OFF SCHOOL MEANS A DAY OFF 
WORK THE HEDIGAN FAMILY ARE ONE OF

SCHOOL TODAY AS A SINGLE MUM OF 
THREE SHE'S HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO 
TAKE A DAY OFF WORK RACHEL HAS 
LOST THIRTY FIVE IN PAY AND SAYS THAT WILL 
AFFECT THE WHOLE FAMILY

TIME TAKINGS SO HIS BUSINESS WILL 
TAKE A KNOCK TODAY BECAUSE OF THE 
TEACHERS' STRIKEVY 
A LIMITED 
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WORKING FOR US 
YOU HAVE ONE PERSON OFF PER 
CENTAGE WISE IT IS A BIG DEAL SO 
FOR ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WORKING 
THEN PERHAPS THEY LOSE DAYS OFF

MONEY THEY WOULD HAVE EARNED FOR 
WORKING THAT DAY 
FOR PARENTS WHO CANNOT GET TIME OFF 
WORK DAY CARE IS ESSENTIAL TODAY

PROCESS WE MAY NOT HAVE COMPLETE 
RESULTS FOR SOME TIME 
THE HIGH COURT HAS RULED THAT 
ORDERS IMPOSED BY THE TREASURY TO 
FREEZE THE ASSETS OF TERRORIST 
SUSPECTS ARE LEGALLY FLAWED AS 
THEY WILL NOT A AS THEY WERE NOT 
APPROVED BY PARLIAMENT FIVE MEN 
WHO WERE DENIED CONTROL OF THEIR 
MONEY TOOK ON THE POWERS THE 
TREASURY SAID IT WAS DISAPPOINTED 
WITH THE JUDGMENT AND WOULD APPEAL 
ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR IT HAS BEEN REPORTED VIDEO 
EVIDENCE HAS EMERGED WHICH SHOWS 
SYRIA WAS BUILDING A NUCLEAR 
REACTOR WITH THE HELP OF NORTH 
KOREA THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS 
DENIED IT HAS ANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
PROGRAMME OR ANY SUCH AGREEMENT 
WITH NORTH KOREA THE CLAIM FOLLOWS 
AN AIR STRIKE BY ISRAEL IN 
SEPTEMBER IT IS THOUGHT THE 
ALLEGED NUCLEAR FACILITY WAS THE 
TARGET TARGET THE B. B. C. HAS LEARNT THAT OPERATING 
THEATRES HAVE BEEN THROWN INTO 
CHAOS AND OPERATIONS CANCELLED 
BECAUSE OF MISSING BROKEN OR DIRTY 
SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS THE ROYAL 
COLLEGE OF SURGEONS SAY THE 
PROBLEMS HAVE BECOME WORSE SINCE 
SOME HOSPITALS BROUGHT IN PRIVATE 
CONTRACTORS TO CLEAN THE 
INSTRUMENTS 
THESE ARE THE INSTRUMENTS FOR JUST 
ONE OPERATION EVERY TRAY HAS TO BE 
IN PERFECT CONDITION IF ANYTHING 
IS MISSING BROKEN OR DIRTY IT IS 
USELESS TO THE SURGEON THESE 
PHOTOS SHOW WHAT SURGEONS ARE 
FINDING IN TRAYS MEANT TO BE CLEAN 
GIVEN TO THE B. B. C. BY THE SURGEONS' 
ORGANISATION THEY ARE WORRIED 
CHANGES TO DECONTAMINATION ARE 
THREATENING STANDARDS EACH YEAR 
MILLIONS OF TRAYS OF SURGICAL 
INSTRUMENTS ARE STERILISED FOR USE 
WITH THE NEXT PATIENT HOSPITALS 
HAD THEIR OWN DECONTAMINATION UNIT 
IN THE PASTS NOW SERVICES ARE 
BEING CENTRALISED AND WHERE THE 
PROCESS IS UNDER WAY PROBLEMS HAVE 
EMERGED 
THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE EMERGED COMING IN INCOMPLETE KITS SO AN 
OPERATION MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GO 
AHEAD OR IF IT DOES GO AHEAD IT 
INVOLVES OPENING A BACK UP KIT AND 
IF THE BACK UP KIT HAS TO BE OPENED 
SOMEONE ELSE'S OPERATION IS 
CANCELLED 
HELENE RIGATE HAD HER CANCELLED OPERATION CANCELLED TWICE THE 
HOSPITAL ADMITS ITS DECONTAMINATION 
SERVICE WAS TO BLAME THE COMPANY 
CARRYING OUT THE WORK SAYS MISTAKES 
ARE RARE AND IT USES STATE OF THE 
ART TECHNOLOGY FOR HELENE IT WAS 
AN UPSETTING EXPERIENCE 
FOR IT TO 
HAPPEN A SECOND TIME I WAS VERY 
UPSET AND VERY ANGRY AS WELL IT IS 
NOT FAIR IT IS YOUR LIFE YOU PUT 
YOUR WHOLE LIFE ON HOLD FOR THESE 
THINGS AND THEN TO BE TOLD GO 
AWAY 
ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEONS ARE AWAY FRUSTRATED 
GYNAECOLOGY INSTRUMENTS FRUSTRATED HAVE APPEARED IN ORTHOPAEDIC TRAYS 
THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES OF TRAY 
WRAPS BEING DAMAGED THERE HAVE 
BEEN INSTANCES OF INSTRUMENTS SENT 
BACK THAT HAVEN'T BEEN STERILISED 
SURGEONS RELY ON THE RIGHT 
EQUIPMENT FOR THEIR OPERATIONS THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS IT HAS INVESTED 
HEAVILY IN DECONTAMINATION SERVICES 
TWO HUNDRED MILLION HAS BEEN SPENT IN 
ENGLAND THE HEALTH UNION UNISON 
HAS CALLED FOR A HALT TO 
DECONTAMINATION SUPER CENTRES UNTIL 
PROBLEMS ARE RESOLVED 
OUR TOP STORY A COURT HAS HEARD 
I LOVE YOU TO BITS 
A COURT HAS 
HEARD THE CHILLING FAREWELL MESSAGE 
FROM THE RINGLEADER OF THE SEVEN SEVENTHS 
SUICIDE BOMBERS TO HIS BABY 
DAUGHTER DAUGHTER COMING UP BRITAIN'S BIGGEST BANKS 
LOSE A LANDMARK COURT RULING OVER 
PENALTY CHARGES FOR OVERDRAFTS 
WE PUT THE QUESTIONS YOU WANT 
ANSWERED TO MAYORAL CANDIDATE BRIAN 
PADDICK PADDICK AND LONDON'S PARISH CHURCH OPENS 
ITS DOORS AFTER A MULTI MILLION 
POUND RESTORATION 
MOTORISTS IN SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN 
ENGLAND ARE BEING TOLD THERE WILL 
BE ENOUGH FUEL EVEN IF THE 
GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY IS CLOSED DOWN 
BY STRIKE ACTION THE CLOSURE COULD 
LIMIT OIL SUPPLIES FROM THE NORTH 
SEA BUT THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SAID 
EXTRA SUPPLIES WOULD COVER ANY 
SHORTAGES AND THERE WAS NO NEED TO 
USE EMERGENCY POWERS ANDREW 
CASSELL IS AT GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY 
TONIGHT TONIGHT GEORGE DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE 
PLUMES OF SMOKE YOU CAN SEE HERE 
THIS IS A PLANT AT THE CENTRE OF A 
BITTER INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE WHICH IS 
IN THE PROCESS OF BEING CLOSED DOWN 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME THIS GIANT 
GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY WILL HAVE BEEN 
SHUT DOWN SINCE THE SECOND WORLD 
WAR WAR THE GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY IS HUGE 
COVERING NEARLY TWO THOUSAND ACRES THEY 
BEGAN SHUTTING IT DOWN ON MONDAY 
AN OPERATION WILL BE COMPLETED BY 
SATURDAY NORMALLY GRANGEMOUTH 
PROCESSES TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL A 
DAY TURNING IT INTO PETROL OR 
DIESEL THE FUEL IT PRODUCES 
SUPPLIES MOST OF SCOTLAND NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND PARTS OF NORTHERN 
ENGLAND ONCE CLOSED IT WILL TAKE 
UP TO FOUR WEEKS TO GET IT BACK 
INTO FULL PRODUCTION TONIGHT B. P. 
TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT THE SHUT DOWN 
COULD FORCE THEM TO CLOSE A 
NEIGHBOURING PLANT WHICH COLLECTS 
NEARLY A THIRD OF THE U. K.'S OIL 
DIRECT FROM THE NORTH SEA VIA A 
PIPELINE BUT U. K. MINISTERS INSIST 
THERE SHOULD BE NO FUEL CRISIS 
THERE'S PLENTY OF FUEL IN SCOTLAND 
OF ALL TYPES PETROL DIESEL AND 
FOR THE AIRLINE COMPANIES TO MEET 
DEMAND OVER THE NEXT PERIOD OF TIME 
SO THERE ISN'T ANY EXCUSE OR ANY 
REASON FOR PEOPLE TO DO ANYTHING 
OTHER THAN BUY FUEL IN THE NORMAL 
WAY THEY WOULD DO SO 
TODAY IN 
GLASGOW VERY LITTLE SIGN OF PANIC 
BUYING FROM MOTORISTS AS THEY 
DIGESTED THE NEWS THAT TALKS HAD 
FAILED TO HEAD OFF THE STRIKE 
ELSEWHERE THOUGH THERE IS 
EVIDENCE OF SHORTAGES AT THE PUMPS 
ESPECIALLY IN SOME RURAL AREAS 
BOTH THE OWNERS AND THE UNIONS AT 
GRANGEMOUTH BLAME EACH OTHER FOR 
THE STRIKE WHICH HAS LED TO THE 
SHUT DOWN 
WE HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SHUT DOWN RESPONSIBLE WE WERE IN A 
NEGOTIATION ON THIS PENSION WHICH 
WAS A NINE MONTH NEGOTIATION AND 
AFTER SIX MONTHS THE UNION STOOD UP 
AND SAID WE ARE GOING TO GO ON 
STRIKE 
WE HAVE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN STRIKE IF THEY MAKE AN APPROACH AND TELL 
US THAT THEY ARE LIFTING AWAY THAT 
PROPOSAL WE WILL GET INTO TALKS 
WITH THEM STRAIGHTAWAY I'M NOT 
HOPEFUL OF THAT THE WAY THEY ARE 
BEHAVING THEY ARE LEADING US TO 
THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY WANT US TO 
ESCALATE THIS 
AS PLANS ARE 
PREPARED AIRLINES HAVE BEEN 
ADVISED TO REFUEL AIRCRAFT OUTSIDE 
SCOTLAND AS A PRECAUTION THOUGH 
FERRY COMPANIES SAY THEIR SERVICES 
SHOULD BE UNAFFECTED 
THAT REFERENCE BY B. P. TO THE 
PIPELINE SYSTEM THAT THEY MAY BE 
FORCED TO CLOSE HAS CAUSED SOME 
VOLATILITY ON THE OIL MARKETS TODAY 
MINISTERS HERE AND IN LONDON ARE 
ADAMANT THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT 
FUEL SUPPLIES TO LAST WELL INTO THE 
MIDDLE OF NEXT MONTH PROVIDED OF 
COURSE THERE IS NOT PANIC BUYING 
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED M. P.'S HAVE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME PUBLICLY DECLARED THAT 
THEY EMPLOY MEMBERS OF THEIR 
FAMILIES ALL OF THEM HAVE LISTED 
THE RELATIVES IN THE REGISTER OF 
MEMBERS' INTERESTS WHICH HAS BEEN 
PUBLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
THE EXPENSES SCANDAL INVOLVING THE 
M. P. DEREK CONWAY THERE IS NO 
SUGGESTION THAT ANY OF THEM HAVE 
BROKEN PARLIAMENTARY RULES 
THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER DAVID 
CAMERON HAS WARNED OF A RISING 
TIDE OF CRIME IN BRITAIN HE MADE 
HIS CLAIM DESPITE THE FACT THE 
LATEST OFFICIAL FIGURES SHOWED 
CRIME FALLING FOR THE SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE QUARTER MR. CAMERON WAS 
SPEAKING TO THE B. B. C.'S POLITICAL 
EDITOR IN THE SECOND OF OUR PARTY 
LEADER INTERVIEWS AHEAD OF THE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS 
IT WAS A CURIOUS DAY AND A CURIOUS 
PLACE FOR DAVID CAMERON TO TALK OF 
A RISING TIDE OF CRIME ANY ANY WORRIES ANY SHOPLIFTING OR IS 
EVERYTHING QUIET 
PEACEFUL AND 
QUIET DOES SEEM TO SUM UP HAMPSHIRE 
CRIME IS FALLING HERE WHAT'S MORE 
TWO SETS OF STATISTICS PUBLISHED 
TODAY SUGGESTS IT IS FALLING 
NATIONALLY TOO RECORDED CRIME 
FELL TWELVE PER CENT IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
OF LAST YEAR THE BRITISH CRIME 
SURVEY AGREES GUN CRIME AND DRUG 
CRIME THOUGH HAVE INCREASED L. 
ASKED DAVID CAMERON WHY HE INSISTED 
ON SAYING THAT CRIME WAS RISING 
THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT FIGURES IN 
THE CRIME FIGURES TODAY ARE THE 
FACT THAT GUN CRIME INCIDENTS ARE 
UP FOUR PER CENT AND DRUG CRIMES ARE UP TWENTY PER CENT 
THAT IS HUGELY IMPORTANT 
CAN YOU 
BRING YOURSELF TO ADMIT CRIME IS 
FALLING IN BRITAIN THAT IS WHAT 
THE FIGURES SAY 
WELL THE FIGURES 
TODAY SHOW SOME CRIMES FALLING AND 
OTHER CRIMES RISING 
THEY SHOW 
CRIME OVERALL FALLING ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY THAT'S GOOD WHERE THERE IS FALLING 
FIGURES PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN 
SOME AREAS BURGLARY DWELLINGS 
CAR CRIME THERE ARE REAL PROBLEMS 
IN TERMS OF GUNS AND DRUGS AND 
KNIVES AND VIOLENCE 
THE TORY 
LEADER'S HOST SAYS PEOPLE AND 
POLITICIANS SHOULD BELIEVE THE 
STATS 
MY VIEW BASED ON TWENTY FIVE YEARS STATS IS YOU CAN ALSO PROVE A TRUE FACT 
THAT IS CRIME IS FALLING LOCALLY 
POLITICIANS WOULD DO WELL TO SAY 
SO YES WANT TO POINT OUT WHERE SO YES I LIVE IS CONSIDERABLY SAFER IN 
TERMS OF VEHICLE CRIME THAN NOTTING 
HILL PROPER 
THE CONSERVATIVES 
PROPOSE TODAY THAT CRIME MAPS 
SHOULD BE PUBLISHED FOR EVERY 
STREET IN BRITAIN SHOWING WHAT 
CRIMES HAPPEN WHEN AND WHERE THERE THERE IS ENORMOUS ANXIETY ABOUT CRIME AND 
ALSO AREAS WITH HIGH CRIME ARE 
ALREADY SUFFERING FROM THAT IMAGE 
MUCH BETTER IS TO PUBLISH THE 
INFORMATION IN A MAP WHAT CRIMES 
ARE TAKING PLACE WHERE AND WHEN 
THEN GIVE PEOPLE THAT INFORMATION 
THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO CALL THE 
POLICE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT AND TO 
WORK WITH THE POLICE TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
DAVID CAMERON 
KNOWS THAT AS GORDON BROWN'S 
TROUBLES MOUNT HE WILL COME UNDER 
MORE AND MORE SCRUTINY IF YOU WERE 
PRIME MINISTER I ASKED HIM TODAY 
WOULD YOU BE SAYING THAT CRIME WAS 
FALLING HE DIDN'T SAY 
GET RID OF 
THAT GORDON BROWN 
I WILL DO MY 
BEST 
GET THE COUNTRY STRAIGHT BEST AGAINLY 
DO MY BEST BRITAIN'S AGAINLY BRITAIN'S BIGGEST BANKS HAVE LOST A LANDMARK 
CASE WHICH COULD MEN THEM PAYING 
BACK HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS 
IN OVERDRAFT CHARGES THE JUDGE 
RULED THE CHARGES CAN BE CHALLENGED 
UNDER CONSUMER FAIRNESS LEGISLATION 
AT FIRST ONLY FEW CAMPAIGNERS 
WERE ARGUING AGAINST BANK CHARGES 
SOON MORE AND MORE WEBSITES GOT IN 
ON THE ACT MILLIONS OF TEMPLATE 
LETTERS WERE DOWNLOADED AS PEOPLE 
TRIED TO CLAIM BACK THOUSANDS OF 
POUNDS EACH ONE OF THEM WAS MARIE 
PACE SHE'S HAD FIVE HUNDRED BACK FROM HER 
BANK AND HAS ANOTHER CLAIM WAITING 
TO BE DEALT WITH 
THE DIRECT DEBIT 
COMES OFF A DAY EARLIER THAN IT 
SHOULD HAVE OR IF WAGES HAVE GONE 
IN LATE SOMETIMES IT IS NOT YOUR 
FAULT THE BANK THEN BAM THEY PUT 
THE CHARGES IN 
A LOT OF ANGER IS 
DIRECTED AT THE SIZE OF THE CHARGES 
GOING OVERDRAWN WITHOUT 
AUTHORISATION CAN MEAN A BILL OF 
THIRTY FIVE IF A DIRECT DEBIT OR CHEQUE 
GETS REFUSED AS A RESULT THERE 
COULD BE ANOTHER CHARGE AND THINGS 
CAN SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL TODAY'S 
JUDGMENT SAYS BANK CHARGES CAN BE 
CHALLENGED UNDER CONSUMER LAW 
CAMPAIGNERS ARE HAPPY WITH THE 
RULING 
BANKS LEVY CHARGES OF THIRTY FIVE RULING IT SHOULDN'T BE DISPROPORTIONATE TO 
WHAT THEY COST IT CAN ONLY COST 
THEM A COUPLE OF QUID TO SEND AN 
AUTOMATED LETTER L. CAN'T SEE THE 
OFT SAYING THEY ARE NOT UNLAWFUL 
THERE IS LOT OF LEGAL ARGUMENT TO 
COME THE BANKS COULD APPEAL AND 
COULD ALSO FIGHT ANY CHALLENGE FROM 
THE OFT 
WE ARE AT THE START OF A 
PROCESS THERE IS MORE LEGAL 
DISCUSSION THAT WILL BE TAKING 
PLACE AND A DISCUSSION PARTICULARLY 
IN ABOUT FOUR WEEKS' TIME AT THE 
COURT TO SEE WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS 
NEXT 
TODAY'S JUDGMENT IS GOOD NEWS NEXT FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
WHO ARE TRYING TO RECLAIM CHARGES 
FROM THEIR BANK IT DOESN'T MEAN 
THAT THOSE CHARGES ARE UNFAIR AND 
IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WILL GET THEIR 
MONEY BACK IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP 
IN THAT DIRECTION 
ALL RIGHT LET'S GET THE WEATHER 
NOW 
I WILL START WITH THE STORY OF 
TODAY'S WET WEATHER A BAND OF RAIN 
THAT PUSHED THROUGH FROM WEST TO 
EAST WE SAW THAT YESTERDAY UNLIKE 
YESTERDAY SHOWERS FOLLOWED ON AND 
SOME OF THESE HAVE PACKED QUITE A 
PUNCH WITH HAIL WITH THUNDER AND 
SOME GUSTY WINDS THERE HAS BEEN 
SOME SUNSHINE AND WHAT SHOWERS ARE 
LEFT WILL EASE AWAY OVER THE NEXT 
FEW HOURS THERE MAY BE ONE AT 
IBROX THIS EVENING FOR THE UEFA CUP 
SEMIFINAL 
FOR MOST IT IS ANOTHER FROST FREE 
NIGHT AT SIX TO NINE DEGREES IN EASTERN 
SCOTLAND COLD ENOUGH HERE FOR A 
TOUCH OF GROUND FROST TOMORROW IS 
A VERY DIFFERENT DAY MUCH MORE 
CLOUD AROUND AND SOME RAIN COMING 
IN TO PLACES THE BEST OF THE EARLY 
BRIGHTNESS WILL BE IN THE EAST BUT 
EVEN THAT REPLACED BY INCREASING 
CLOUD FOR THE AFTERNOON LET'S 
START IN THE SOUTH EAST THERE MAY 
STILL BE SOME HINTS OF BRIGHTNESS 
HERE ESPECIALLY INTO KENT STILL 
QUITE WARM IN LONDON AS WE COME 
FURTHER WEST YOU WILL COUNT 
YOURSELF VERY LUCKY IF YOU GET TO 
SEE ANY SUNSHINE THERE MAY BE A 
BIT TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF HIGH 
GROUND 
SOME DRIZZLE OVER THE MOORS IN THE 
SOUTH WEST SOME LIGHT RAIN TO THE 
WEST OF WALES MORNING RAIN IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND WILL GIVE WAY TO 
SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DRIER AS WE 
GO THROUGH THE AFTERNOON BUT VERY 
DULL THAT RAIN PUSHES ON INTO THE 
WESTERN SIDE OF SCOTLAND SOME 
HEAVY RAIN COMING IN HERE 
SO AFTER THAT DIFFERENT DAY FOR 
SATURDAY SOMETHING BRIGHTER AND 
WARMER ACROSS THE SOUTH A BAND OF 
RAIN STILL SITTING ACROSS NORTHERN 
IRELAND SOUTHERN SCOTLAND AND 
NORTHERN ENGLAND ITS EXACT 
POSITION MAY CHANGE THOUGH BETWEEN 
NOW AND THEN 
THAT IS IT STAY WITH US TIME TO 
JOIN B. B. C. NEWS TEAMS WHERE YOU ARE 
ACCUSED OF LYING KEN LIVINGSTONE
