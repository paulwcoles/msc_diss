LEAVE THIS TO ME 
WELCOME BACK 
ROUND THREE IS ABOUT PURE STRENGTH 
IT'S BASICALLY A MOTOR RACE BUT A MOTOR RACE WITH A DIFFERENCE 
THE COMPETITORS HAVE TO PULL THIS TRUCK 
USING ONLY THEIR BRUTE STRENGTH 
THE QUICKEST SO FAR IS MAGNUS SUPERMAN SORENSON WITH THIS PULL 
HE CROSSED THE LINE IN FIVE HUNDRED ONE SECONDS 
WHICH LEAVES THE OTHERS WITH A LOT TO DO 
NEXT UP IS BIG BLOUSE BIG BLOUSE BARRY CHUCKLE 
SPAGHETTI LEGS WHERE'S THE UGLY ONE COULDN'T BEAR TO WATCH 
HE'S OTHERWISE OCCUPIED I THOUGHT HE'D BE GIVING ADVICE WANT SOME 
YES PLEASE HAVE YOU DONE THIS BEFORE NO 
IN THAT CASE MY ADVICE WOULD BE DON'T 
TAKE THE STRAIN AND PULL 
AND THE WINNER IS BRITAIN'S OWN BARRY CHUCKLE BY TWENTY SECONDS 
JUST A MINUTE I SMELL SOMETHING ODD THAT'LL BE THE LORRY 
IT'S A FISH WAGON FISH WAGON 
YEAH 
SO NOW NOW NOBODY LIKES A SORE LOSER 
OH 
SHALL WE JUST CALL IT A TIE 
NO 
LET'S CALL THIS A TIE 
THIS IS THE LAST TIME HE DOES THIS TO ME 
ONLY BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN BANNED I KNOW 
HOW DARE THEY BAN ME 
YOU WERE CAUGHT CHEATING THAT'S HOW I WAS JUST EVENING UP THE ODDS 
BUT I'VE BEEN DISQUALIFIED FROM THE TRUCK PULL AND HE'S LEADING TWO TO ONE 
IT'S THE BARREL RUN NEXT I'LL HIDE IN A BARREL AND STICK ME FEET OUT 
I'LL DO IT MY WAY SUIT YOURSELF BUT YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN 
PROMISE PROMISE GOOD 
IF I LEAVE IT TO HIM IT'LL NEVER GET DONE 
THE FINAL AND DECIDING ROUND STARTS HERE 
THE OBJECT IS FOR THE COMPETITORS TO CARRY THEIR BARRELS CROSS COUNTRY 
AND ACROSS THE LINE 
SWEDEN'S MAN MOUNTAIN MAGNUS SORENSON IS LEADING 
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF POINTS AT STAKE AND THAT COULD CHANGE 
TAKE YOUR BARRELS 
AH WELL COME ON BARRY DEEP BREATH 
IT'LL HAVE TO BE DEEPER THAN THAT 
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE NEITHER ARE YOU THAT WAY
