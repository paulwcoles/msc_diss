IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT TAKES IT HIGH OR SENDS IT LOW 
YOU CAN WORK IT OUT IF YOU JUST LEARN ABOUT 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN RIDE 
OR BUMP AND JUMP GLIDE AND SLIDE 
TAKE A LITTLE LOOK INSIDE THE WAY THINGS WORK 
AND WATCH THE THINGAMABOB THAT TURNS THE KNOB 
THAT MAKES THE JIGGER JIG 
THAT TURNS THE THINGAMAJIG THAT PULLS THE TRIGGER 
THAT MAKES THE DIGGER DIG 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN FLY 
WITHOUT A WING OR STRING TO TIE WITH 
YOU FIND THE SAME RULES APPLY WITH 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
IT WAS A BRISK AND BREEZY DAY ON MAMMOTH ISLAND 
A PERFECT DAY FOR HANGING OUT YOUR WASHING 
THAT'S IT BOYS KEEP GOING 
MORNING BRENDA DEAR LOVELY DAY 
MMNNN MMNNN 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT BRENDA YSS UMMM FOOO 
PILBEAM WHAT DO YOU MEAN AM I ALL RIGHT 
CAN'T YOU SEE ME STRUGGLING WITH THIS WASHING AND THAT WIND 
ER I'D GIVE YOU A HAND 
BUT I'M TAKING THESE TWO OVER TO PASTURE ISLAND OH TYPICAL 
WHEN YOU WANT HELP THEY ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO 
OH NEVER MIND THIS BIT OF WIND'S NO PROBLEM 
PASTURE ISLAND SAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BIGGEST LAKE ON MAMMOTH ISLAND 
THE GRASS THERE WAS THE FRESHEST ANYWHERE 
THE MAMMOTHS LOVED IT NO ONE REMEMBERED WHO BUILT THE BRIDGE 
BUT MAMMOTHS GRAZED THERE FOR LONGER THAN ANYONE COULD REMEMBER 
KEEP GOING THAT'S THE WAY 
UNFORTUNATELY IT HAD BEEN A WHILE SINCE THE BRIDGE HAD BEEN SERVICED 
EH OH 
TIME WE GOT A MOVE ON 
OH NO I'M STRANDED 
HELLO CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME 
HELP I'M STUCK MAMMOTHS CALL 
GET ME OFF OF HERE HELP 
HEARING PILBEAM'S SHOUTS AND THE MAMMOTHS' CALLS 
A GROUP SOON GATHERED ON THE LAKE'S SHORE 
DON'T WORRY PILBEAM WE'LL SOON RESCUE YOU 
I KNEW YOU'D HAVE A PLAN DAD YOU DO HAVE A PLAN 
HUH GROWN UPS WHY DOESN'T HE JUST SWIM BACK 
WHAT ABOUT THE MAMMOTHS TROY THEY CAN'T SWIM 
EASY HE COULD CARRY THEM ON HIS BACK 
UM COULDN'T HE COUSINS WHO NEEDS THEM 
WELL TOO BAD HE'LL HAVE TO DO HIS OWN WASHING AND DRYING 
DON'T WORRY WE'LL GET HIM BACK DAD YES OLIVE 
THIS WOOD FLOATS ON THE WATER RIGHT 
IF WE TIED LOTS OF PIECES TOGETHER MAYBE IT WOULD FLOAT 
AND SOMEONE COULD RESCUE PILBEAM 
IF WE MAKE IT BIG ENOUGH THE MAMMOTHS COULD COME BACK TOO 
H. M. M. IT COULD WORK WE'D NEED BIGGER PIECES OF WOOD THAN THAT 
TROY FETCH MY AXE PLEASE AND LOTS OF ROPE 
AXE IS THERE GOING TO BE CHOPPING QUITE A LOT OF CHOPPING I'D THINK 
M. M. M. CAN I DO IT YES TROY YOU CAN DO IT 
WHEY HEY HEH HEH HO HO 
HEY HEY HO HO 
THEY SET TO WORK STRAIGHTAWAY 
AS ALWAYS I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THEIR WILLINGNESS TO TRY NEW IDEAS 
OH ARGH 
OH THERE'S NO CRACKS IN 
THANKS JUST ONE MORE SHOULD DO IT 
MAKE IT THINNER THAN THE OTHERS WHY DAD 
YOU'LL SEE ASSUMING THIS THING FLOATS IN THE FIRST PLACE 
RIGHT HERE GOES 
HANG ON PILBEAM WE'LL HAVE YOU OFF THERE IN NO TIME 
YES HA HA I KNEW IT WOULD WORK HA HA 
SO DID I OLIVE WHAT YOU HAVE MADE IS CALLED A RAFT 
WHEN ANYTHING IS PLACED IN WATER 
THE WATER MOVES OUT OF THE WAY AND THEN PUSHES BACK AT THE OBJECT 
THIS IS CALLED THE UPTHRUST 
IF THE FORCE OF THE UPTHRUST EQUALS THE WEIGHT OF THE OBJECT 
THAT OBJECT THE RAFT AND FRANK 
FLOATS 
NICE ONE FRANK I THOUGHT I WAS STUCK HERE FOR GOOD 
SHE'S A CLEVER GIRL MY OLIVE 
THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR ONE MAMMOTH WE'LL COME BACK FOR THE OTHER ONE 
COME ON GIRL THERE'S A GOOD MAMMOTH NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 
JUST GOING FOR A LITTLE TRIP 
O. K. HERE WE GO 
UH 
AH 
I THINK WE MAY NEED AN EXTRA PUSH NO PROBLEM 
OH 
O. K. FRANK READY TO GO 
THREE TWO ONE 
PUSH 
UH FRANK THESE LOGS ARE SUPPOSED TO STAY ON TOP OF THE WATER RIGHT 
THAT'S RIGHT WHY 
AH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN 
SO MUCH FOR ALL THAT UPTHRUST NONSENSE 
WELL NOT REALLY BRENDA YOU SEE 
WHEN THE MAMMOTH AND PILBEAM JOINED FRANK ON THE RAFT 
THE WEIGHT OF THEM ALL TOGETHER 
WAS GREATER THAN THE WEIGHT OF WATER THAT THE RAFT DISPLACED 
THE UPTHRUST WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THEM 
SO IF WE WANT THE RAFT TO STAY AFLOAT WHEN EVERYONE'S ON BOARD 
IT HAS TO DISPLACE MORE WATER YES 
IF WE BUILT A RAFT WITH SIDES LIKE THAT WALNUT SHELL THAT WOULD WORK 
I'VE HEARD EVERYTHING THAT RAFT WOULD BE HEAVIER THAN THE FIRST 
IT WOULD SINK FASTER THAN YOU COULD BLINK TUT 
YOUR COMMON SENSE HAS SUNK WITHOUT TRACE YOUNG LADY 
BRENDA THE SIDES AROUND THE RAFT 
WHICH SOME PEOPLE CALL THE HULL 
WOULD ALLOW IT TO DISPLACE MORE WATER 
THIS WOULD PRODUCE ENOUGH UPTHRUST TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF THE PEOPLE 
AND MAMMOTHS ON BOARD 
IF WE'RE BUILDING ANOTHER RAFT WE'LL NEED WOOD MORE CHOPPING 
WHICH MEANS A LOT MORE PLANTING TO REPLACE WHAT YOU CUT DOWN 
EXCELLENT 
A LOT MORE CHOPPING LATER 
GOOD TO SEE YOU LAD LET'S GET A MAMMOTH ON BOARD 
AND SEE IF THIS ONE WORKS ANY BETTER 
O. K. TROY PUSH AH IT WORKS 
YES BUT WHY IS IT GOING ROUND IN CIRCLES WHAT 
TROY'S PUNTING HARDER THAN DAD 
DAD TROY 
SWAP SIDES 
O. K. 
EXCUSE ME SORRY 
OOH 
OH NO THEY'RE GOING ROUND IN ANOTHER CIRCLE 
YOU'VE GOT TO SWAP SIDES AGAIN AND KEEP SWAPPING SIDES 
OH 
AT LAST 
I DON'T 
FEEL VERY WELL 
OH 
THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY OF DOING THIS 
LITTLE DID OLIVE KNOW BUT INSPIRATION WAS ON ITS WAY 
MY SHEET 
THAT'S BLOWN FROM BRENDA'S GARDEN 
THE WIND'S VERY GOOD AT BLOWING THINGS ALONG HEY 
IF WE COULD GET THE WIND TO PUSH THE BOAT TROY YES 
WE NEED SOME MORE WOOD OH 
MY LOVELY CLEAN SHEET 
THE SHEET CAUGHT THE WIND AND PUSHED THE BOAT ACROSS THE LAKE 
IT'S BEING USED AS A SAIL 
OLIVE AND FRANK FITTED A RUDDER AND A TILLER TO STEER IT 
FRANK REACHED THE ISLAND PILBEAM HERDED THE LAST MAMMOTH ON BOARD 
AND THEN THEY DISCOVERED SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT SAILING LET'S GO 
WE CAN'T THE WIND'S BLOWING THE WRONG WAY NOW THEY'RE BOTH STUCK 
AND SO IS MY SHEET COULDN'T THEY TURN THE SAIL AROUND 
AND MAKE THE BOAT GO THE OTHER WAY NOT QUITE THE OTHER WAY OLIVE 
BUT ALMOST YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SAILING ON OR CLOSE TO THE WIND 
WHEN A BOAT SAILS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND 
IT'S RUNNING BEFORE THE WIND 
WHEN THE SAILS ARE PULLED IN 
THE BOAT SAILS AT ROUGHLY FORTY FIVE DEGREES TO THE WIND DIRECTION 
IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE DIRECTION UPWIND CALLED TACK 
JUST PUSH THE TILLER AND WATCH YOUR HEAD JUST LIKE THAT 
AS WE GO TACKING OR BEATING UPWIND 
AND AFTER A LOT OF SHOUTING FROM THE SHORE 
THAT'S JUST WHAT FRANK AND PILBEAM DID 
ONE MORE TIME SHOULD DO IT OKEY DOKEY OH 
UH FRANK WE'RE GOING PRETTY FAST AREN'T WE 
YES MUCH FASTER THAN WITH THOSE HOLES GREAT INNIT 
YEAH JUST ONE THING THOUGH 
HOW ARE WE GOING TO STOP OH 
DAD PILBEAM ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
I THINK SO 
WE'RE BACK AT ANY RATE 
OH 
TELL YOU WHAT I'M STARVING WHERE'S MY DINNER BRENDA 
DINNER IS THAT ALL YOU CAN THINK OF 
WHAT I'M THINKING IS WHERE'S MY SHEET 
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT BRENDA 
I'M SURE I CAN THINK OF SOMETHING 
WE MIGHT NOT AGREE ON EVERYTHING BRENDA 
BUT YOUR COOKING CERTAINLY AGREES WITH ME 
AND ME 
OLIVE AND TROY WOULD LOVE IT TOO 
I WONDER IF THEY'VE FOUND YOUR SHEET YET 
COME ON TROY IT'S EASY 
YES 
I CAN DO IT I CAN 
AH OH 
IT MUST'VE BEEN A PRETTY BIG SEED THIS COCONUT TREE GREW FROM 
I WONDER IF THE COCONUT ITSELF WAS THE SEED 
COLLECTING COCONUTS IS DIFFICULT AS THEY GROW AT THE TOP OF THE TREE 
AND LIKE TO HIDE UNDER HUGE LEAVES 
IT TOOK SOMEONE WITH SKILL TO BRING THOSE COCONUTS DOWN 
IS IT GOING TO BE O. K. PIECE OF CAKE DO IT ALL THE TIME 
I HAD NEVER EATEN COCONUT THIS FRESH BEFORE 
O. K. 
INSIDE THERE WAS SWEET WATER MY MOTHER TOLD ME NEVER TO SLURP 
WHEN THE COCONUT WAS CUT IN HALF THERE WAS SOFT WHITE FLESH INSIDE 
YOU HAVE TO EAT THIS NOW O. K. 
M. M. M. IT'S LIKE 
COCONUT JELLY IT'S NICE 
HOW COME THIS COCONUT ISN'T BROWN 
THAT I HAVE TO SHOW YOU I'LL SHOW YOU A BROWN ONE 
HOLD ON I WANT HER TO SEE THIS 
ALL RIGHT IF THIS STAYS ON THE TREE LONG ENOUGH 
IT'LL BECOME LIKE THESE SO THIS ONE'S DRIED UP STILL NOT READY 
WE HAVE TO DO THAT O. K. GO AHEAD 
YOU'RE SPINNING THE SHELL OFF MM HMM 
TAKING OFF THE LAST BIT OF SHELL THERE 
IT TAKES A BIT OF SKILL TO DO THAT YOU KNOW 
O. K. ALL RIGHT 
THANK YOU 
THAT'S WHAT I KNOW AS A COCONUT 
O. K. NOW IF YOU DIDN'T TAKE THIS OUT OF THIS 
O. K. THIS WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME A COCONUT TREE 
REALLY MM HMM HOW'S THAT HAPPEN COME HERE AND I'LL SHOW YOU O. K. 
YOU PLACE THIS IN A NICE WARM DAMP PLACE 
UNTIL 
IT SPOUTS LIKE THIS 
TAKE IT WHERE YOU WANT IT PLANT IT AND IT GROWS INTO A TREE 
SO THE COCONUT GROWS FROM A SEED 
JUTS LIKE ALL THE EXOTIC PLANTS FOUND IN THIS TROPICAL PARADISE
