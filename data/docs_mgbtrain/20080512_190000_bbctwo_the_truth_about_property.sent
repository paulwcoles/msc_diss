THIS STUNNING ELIZABETHAN HOUSE HAS 
BEEN BEEN HERE FOR MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED 
YEARS IT HAS SURVIVED WARS AND 
REVOLUTIONS CAN A DREAM HOUSE LIKE 
THIS WITHSTAND THE TURMOIL GOING ON 
NOW 
AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF NOW ESCALATING PRICES IT APPEARS THE 
PROPERTY BOOM IS OVER AND NOW 
NEARLY ALL OF US ARE FEELING THE 
CONSEQUENCES 
SOME OF US ARE CONSEQUENCES STRUGGLING TO GET A MORTGAGE ON ON THE FRIDAY THE MORTGAGE BROKER SAID 
YES YOU CAN HAVE THE MORTGAGE 
AND ON THE MONDAY THEY WERE SAYING 
THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN 
OTHERS ARE BATTLING TO KEEP THEIR 
HOME 
SELL AND LEAVE YOURSELF HOME HOMELESS OR LET THE MORTGAGE TAKE 
IT WHAT DO YOU DO I DON'T KNOW 
AND SOME ARE USING IT AS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MONEY THERE THERE COMES A TIME THAT PROPERTY COMES 
DOWN AS IT HAS HERE THAT IT 
BECOMES SUCH GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY 
YOU DIVE IN 
WE'LL GO ON A JOURNEY 
TO FIND OUT WHAT GETS HURT AND WHO 
DOESN'T AND WHO LOSES AND WHO WINS 
WE'LL ASK THE TRUTH ABOUT PROPERTY 
ARE YOU CRASHPROOF DJORN SPENT 
TWENTY YEARS RESTORING THIS BEAUTIFUL 
TUDOR MANOR HOUSE NOW HE WANTS TO 
SELL IT THIS IS AMAZING YOU SEE 
LOTS OF MOCK TUEDOR PLACES THIS IS 
THE REAL THING 
THAT IS REALLY THE 
REAL THING 
WHEN WAS IT BUILT WHEN WHEN I COME IT WAS BLACK AND WHITE 
FACADE AND FEABLE DASH THAT THAT BORDERS ON CRIMINAL WHAT ELSE DID 
YOU HAVE TO DO 
PEBBLE DASH THE 
WHOLE BUILDING HAD TO BE TAKEN DOWN 
AND RESTORED PROPERLY WITH WATTLE 
AND DAUB 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD 
HAVE THOUGHT THIS WOULD KEEP THE 
PROPERTY 
WHEN WE THOUGHT ABOUT PROPERTY PUTTING IT ON THE MARKET A YEAR 
AND A HALF AGO WE KNEW WE COULD 
GET ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE 
AND NOW 
PUT IT ON ONE POINT TWO FIVE 
ON THE STOCK MARKET THEY CALL TWO 
TAKING A HAIRCUT 
TO PUT IT DOWN TO 
WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A REALISTIC 
PRICE FOURTEEN MILLION I WILL ACCEPT 
THAT AND I'LL BE HAPPY IN SELLING 
IT FOR FOURTEEN 
IF HOUSE PRICES FALL 
FURTHER WILL BJORN BE FORCED TO 
ACCEPT A BIGGER CUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR IN HIS 
ASKING PRICE MY WORK AS A 
FINANCIAL JOURNALIST HAS CONVINCED 
ME PROPERTY IS STILL GREATLY 
OVERVALUED MY FAMILY AND I RENT 
THIS HOUSE IF PRICES KEEP FALLING 
I'M HOPING I MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUY 
ONE I'M AN ECONOMIST AND I OWN MY 
OWN HOME OR RATHER THE BANK DOES 
I HAVE A THUMPING GREAT MORTGAGE 
I'M NOT KEEN ON FALLING PRICES L. 
WOULD LIKE THE HOME TO KEEP ITS 
VALUE THE HOUSING MARKET HAS 
FALLEN MORE THAN FIVE PER CENT FROM THE PEAK 
IT HAS BEEN GREATED GREETED WITH 
THE WORDS CRISIS COLLAPSE AND 
DISASTER IN OTHER WORDS FEAR TO TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE PRICES HAVE 
TREBLED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND DO FALLING 
HOUSE PRICES HARM US FINANCIALLY 
SHOULD WE BE AFRAID 
WE WANT TO 
FIND OUT IF PEOPLE REALLY THINK 
HOUSE PRICE FALLS WOULD MAKE THEM 
WORSE OFF WE'RE DOING SPOT OF 
MARKET RESEARCH WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
YOU'LL FIND OUT 
I THINK A LOT OF 
PEOPLE OUT THERE OWN THEIR OWN HOME 
OR ARE MORTGAGED UP TO THE HILT AND 
I THINK THEY WILL BE REALLY NERVOUS 
AND THEY WILL WANT PRICES TO GO UP 
I RECKON MANY MORE WOULD BE LOT 
BETTER OFF IF PRICES GO DOWN I I DON'T THINK PEOPLE CAN STOMACH THAT 
THEY WANT IT STEADY OR GOING UP 
WHAT WILL THE PEOPLE OF CAMBRIDGE 
HAVE TO SAY 
HELLO WE'RE TRYING TO 
FIND OUT 
WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT 
HOUSE PRICES 
TO GO DOWN 
THEN I 
CAN BUY MY COUNCIL HOUSE AFTER 
PAYING RENT FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS FOR 
ORDINARY WORKERS LIKE ME AND MY 
CHILDREN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BUY 
CAN YOU WEAR A STICKER FOR ME I I GET LESS FOR MINE I'LL PAY LESS 
FOR WHAT I'M BUYING 
IF IT FALLS IT 
WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU 
YES L. 
WOULD PREFER THEM TO FLAT PLATEAU 
THAN FALL 
COME DOWN OF COURSE 
I WOULD LIKE TO GET ON THE PROPERTY 
LADDER SOON MYSELF THEY ARE TOO 
EXPENSIVE WHILE I'M BUYING IF I 
WAS SELLING I WANT THEM TO GO UP 
AGAIN 
YOU WANT HOUSE PRICES TO AGAIN FUEL WE WERE SURPRISED HOW FEW 
PEOPLE IN CAMBRIDGE WANTED PRICES 
TO GO UP WE COMMISSIONED A 
NATIONAL POLL TURNS OUT ONLY A 
FIFTH WANT PRICES TO RISE HALF 
WANT THEM TO STAY THE SAME AND MORE 
THAN A QUARTER WANT THEM TO FALL 
LEE ON SEA IN ESSEX IT HAS SUN 
SAND AND A FORTY FIVE MINUTE LINK TO LONDON 
IF ANYWHERE IS LIKELY TO BE CRASH 
PROOF SURELY IT IS THIS KIND OF 
TOWN IT REALLY FEELS LIKE SPRING 
IS FINALLY IN THE AIR AROUND THAT 
TIME THE HOUSING MARKET 
TRADITIONALLY BURSTS INTO LIFE 
THIS YEAR I HAVE A FEELING THE 
RULES OF THE GAME HAVE CHANGED HOW 
IS THE HOUSING MARKET FARING NOW 
THAT NATIONALLY IT HAS TAKEN A DOWN 
TURN WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE 
HOUSING MARKET AT THE MOMENT THE THE DEMAND HAS FALLEN SIGNIFICANTLY TO 
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE NUMBER OF 
APPLICANTS WE HAVE GOT ON OUR 
MAILING LIST IS JUST OVER HALF OF 
WHAT IT WAS TWELVE MONTHS AGO SUPPLY 
WE HAVE GOT JUST UNDER FIFTY FIVE PER CENT MORE 
THAN A YEAR AGO 
HALF AS MUCH AGAIN 
ON THE BOOKS TO SELL AND FEWER 
LOOKING 
HOUSE PRICES HAVE GONE UP LOOKING THREE HUNDRED PER CENT SINCE THE LAST TEN TWELVE YEARS 
WHICH IS REASONABLY CONSISTANT I 
SUSPECT WITH MOST OF THE COUNTRY 
I'M SAYING TO MY CLIENTS I'LL GET 
YOU THE TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE PER CENT INCREASE NOT THREE HUNDRED PER CENT 
BUT IF YOU SAY YOU'LL SELL FOR LESS 
THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED THAT YOU THOUGHT IT 
SOUNDS WORSE DO YOU THINK BUYERS 
ARE PUTTING IN CHEEKY OFFERS I I THINK THEY ARE BEING CAUTIOUS WHY WHY BUY WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW HOW FAR THE 
MARKET MIGHT FALL 
THAT UNCERTAINTY 
IS CAUSING PROPERTY SALES TO SLOW 
HOW DO YOU TURN ALL THAT 
UNCERTAINTY THAT IS SWIRLING AROUND 
THE HOUSING MARKET INTO AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MONEY WITH A 
LITTLE BIT OF LUCK WE'RE ABOUT TO 
FIND OUT I'VE COME TO MEET RAJ 
WHO VALUES HIS PROPERTY PORTFOLIO 
AT OVER EIGHT MILLION DESPITE THE 
GLOOM IN THE HOUSING MARKET HE'S 
STILL BUYING 
WELCOME TO MY HOME 
THESE ARE YOURS ARE THEY 
THIS IS 
MY EVER DAY DRIVER L. DID A COUPLE 
OF PROPERTY DEALS RECENTLY L. 
BROUGHT THE FERRARI A COMPLETE 
WASTE OF MONEY BUT IT PUTS A SMILE 
ON MY FACE 
RAJ SAYS HE HAS 
BORROWED FIVE MILLION TO BUILD UP HIS 
PROPERTY FOR THE PORT NOEL YO 
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL PORTFOLIO 
I'VE BEEN HERE FIVE YEARS I I STARTED OFF IN A RENTED ROOM IN A 
THREE BEDROOM SEMI 
HOW LONG AGO 
FIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO 
IS THAT 
BECAUSE OF YOUR PROPERTY 
INVESTMENTS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
WHAT DID YOU DO INVESTMENTS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT BUY TO LETS OR BUY PLACES AND SOLD 
ON 
SOME I TURNED AND SOME I ON BOUGHT AND SOLD STRAIGHT AWAY ARE ARE YOU TAKING A RISK BUYING IN THIS 
MARKET 
IF I BUY WAY UNDER VALUE MARKET IF IT'S WORTH THIS AND I'M BUYING 
HERE IF I HAVE STILL GOT THE 
CUSHION 
HOW DO YOU PERSUADE THEM CUSHION TO SELL AT THAT PRICE 
I'M STARTING 
TO DO WHAT IS CALLED RENT BACKS F. 
PEOPLE RENT IT OFF ME AND IF THEY 
WANT TO BUY IT THEY CAN BUY IT IN 
A FEW YEARS' TIME YOU GIVE THEM 
THE OPTION TO BUY IN THE FUTURE 
THEY SELL IT AT A LOWER PRICE IT IT HAS TO BE A WIN SLASH WIN SITUATION IT'S 
GOOD FOR ME AND GOOD FOR THEM AS 
THEY ARE NOT THROWN OUT OF THEIR 
HOUSE AS REPOSSESSION 
RAJ TARGETS 
BLUE COLLAR TOWNS AND MAKES 
LEAFLETS DROPS TO MAKE AN OFFER TO 
BUY IT IS KNOWN AS MORTGAGE RESCUE 
I GOT A GIRL THAT PUTS LEAFLETS IN 
THE DOOR SAYS THINGS LIKE STUCK IN 
A CHAIN REPOSSESSION STOPPED AND 
CALL MY NUMBER BASICALLY 
WHAT HIS 
LAEFRLET DOESN'T SAY HE WILL ONLY 
OFFER EIGHT O. PER CENT OF THE HOUSES' VALUE IT 
DOESN'T NEED TO THERE'S NO 
REGULATION 
ANYBODY IN THE LAST TEN REGULATION YEARS CAN MAKE MONEY IN PROPERTY 
NOW IT IS THE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE 
MAKING MONEY WHO KNOW HOW TO MAKE 
MONEY IN ANY MARKET 
THAT'S YOU 
THAT'S MERAJ 
HAS BEEN A BIG 
PROMOTER ON BUY TO LET TIMES HAVE 
CHANGED BANKS WOULD LEND MORE THAN 
EIGHTY PER CENT ON A PROPERTY L. WANT TO FIND 
OUT WHAT PEOPLE RAJ LEAFLETED 
THOUGHT OF THE PROPERTY YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING TO SELL YOUR HOUSE AT ALL 
NOT AT THE MOMENT 
IF YOU WERE 
LOOKING AT IT AND HAD THAT IN THE 
CUPBOARD WOULD YOU THINK OF 
RINGING 
PROBABLY YEAH SOMETIMES RINGING SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SELL QUICKLY 
IT WOULD 
NOT MAKE YOU SUSPICIOUS 
I WOULD 
PHONE IT AND FIND OUT 
SO A 
POSSIBLE CUSTOMER 
IT IS A MATTER 
OF TIME IT IS LIKE A PACK OF CARDS 
YOU HAVE FOUR ACES KEEP DEALING 
AND EVENTUALLY ONE W. WILL POP UP 
IF YOU WERE AND HAD THAT IN THE 
CUPBOARD IS THAT SOMETHING THAT 
YOU WOULD RING UP

THAT THAT WOULD MAKE YOU RING THE 
NUMBER 
IT SAYS QUICKLY 
DO YOU NUMBER EVER FEEL YOU'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE 
OF THE CUSTOMER 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE 
ETHICS THEY WOULD BE OUT ON THE 
STREETS ANYWAY 
DON'T TELL ME

THE THINGS WE ARE ALL FACING 
HIGHER MORTGAGE PAYMENTS BIG BILLS 
IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AS 
LONG AS YOU KEEP UP THE PAYMENTS IT 
IS O. K. WHEN YOU GET A BIG CHANGE OF 
PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THEN YOU 
COULD BE THREATENED WITH LOSING 
YOUR HOME IT IS A SERIOUS DANGER 
I WILL BE BACK TO SEE IF THEY CAN 
FIND A WAY OUT 
BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE TRYING TO GET 
ON THE PROPERTY LADDER THE FIRST 
TIME BUYERS LOWER PRICES SHOULD BE 
GOOD NEWS FOR THEM UNTIL RECENTLY 
THE ELKINS FAMILY HAD BEEN PRICED 
OUT OF THE MARKET NOW THOUGH 
THEY THINK IT IS AN IDEAL TIME TO 
BUY BUY SIMON HELLO 
I'M JENNY 
COME ON IN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU ARE A 
WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER 
YES A BIT OF 
A GIVE AWAY 
BEAUTIFUL PHOTOS 
THEY ARE LOVELY THAT EARNS YOU A 
DECENT INCOME DOES IT 
IT DOES I 
EARN IN EXCESS OF FIFTY THOUSAND WHICH I 
CONSIDER A GOOD INCOME 
SO THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS WITH YOU 
GETTING MORTGAGE 
YOU WOULD THINK 
NOT BUT I HAVE MORTGAGE PROMISES 
I APREEMPED A FEW COMPANIES THEY 
DID THE CREDIT CHECKS THEY WERE 
HAPPY TO LEND L. FOUND A HOUSE UP 
FOR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND L. PUT IN AN OFFER OF 
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND IT WAS ACCEPTED MY WIFE 
AND CHILDREN WERE HAPPY THEY 
THOUGHT WE WOULD BE MOVING INTO A 
LOVELY NEW HOUSE THEN A FEW DAYS 
LATER I HAD A PHONE CALL WITH BAD 
NEWS FROM THE MORTGAGE BROKER THEY 
ARE WITHDRAWING THE MORTGAGE 
PRODUCT WE WENT ON TO A DIFFERENT 
COMPANY THEN ANOTHER PHONE CALL 
THAT OFFER WAS WITHDRAWN AS WELL 
SO NOT JUST YOUR OFFER BUT 
WITHDRAWING THE PRODUCT FROM THE 
MARKET ALL THE TIME 
THAT'S RIGHT 
ON THE FRIDAY THE MORTGAGE WOULD 
BE AGREED I COULD HAVE IT ON THE 
MONDAY THEY WERE RINGING UP TO SAY 
THAT PRODUCT HAD BEEN MOVED ON IT 
WAS LITERALLY AS QUICK AS THAT 
YOU EARN MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND YOU 
HAVE ALMOST TEN THOUSAND IN THE BANK A 
CLEAN CREDIT HISTORY I CAN'T 
BELIEVE YOU CAN'T GET MORTGAGE 
SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE OUT THERE MUST 
BE WILLING TO LEND YOU MONEY I'M 
ON A MISSION COME ON LET'S GET 
YOU A MORTGAGE 
I'LL GRAB MY COAT 
ON SIMON'S LOCAL HIGH STREET IN 
NORTH HAMPTON THERE ARE NO 
SHORTAGE OF LENDERS WILL ANY OF 
THEM COME UP WITH MORTGAGE FOR 
HIM WHAT IS THE GAME PLAN 
I AM 
GOING DOWN THIS WAY 
I'LL GO DOWN 
THIS WAY 
TWELVE MONTHS AGO THERE WERE MORE THAN 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND DIFFERENT MORTGAGES NOW 
THERE ARE LESS THAN FOUR THOUSAND PLUS YOU 
NEED A LARGER DEPOSIT AS WE FOUND 
OUT OUT I AM AFRAID IT IS BAD NEWS THEY CAN 
OFFER ME NINETY PER CENT THAT IS A TEN PER CENT DEPOS IT 
I HAVE NOT THAT 
THE MOST THEY CAN OFFER IS A NINETY PER CENT 
MORTGAGE THAT MEANS A DEPOS IT OF 
OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND ONCE YOU ADD IN STAMP 
DUTIES IT WILL NOT WORK 
THEY WILL LEND FIVE PER CENT BUT THERE WAS 
HIGHER LENDING FEE 
NOBODY AVAILABLE TO SPEAK TO ME IN IN THE LAST YEAR THE NUMBER OF NEW 
LOANS TO BUY HOUSES HAS FALLEN TO 
ITS LOWEST POINT SINCE THE RECORDS 
BEGAN BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE 
THEY WILL GO TO NINETY FIVE PER CENT BUT COULD 
CHARGE UP TO THREE THOUSAND FOR THE 
PRIVILEGE PRIVILEGE THAT IS NO AS WELL 
NO GO 
BETWEEN US WE TRIED MORE THAN FIFTEEN 
DIFFERENT LENDERS THEY ALL SAID 
THE SAME THING SOME NINETY FIVE PER CENT MORTGAGES 
ARE AVAILABLE BUT ONLY WITH EXTRA 
FEES OR HIGH INTEREST RATES THE 
DAYS OF THE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGE RATE ARE 
GONE GONE YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND 
TO PUT DOWN YOU WILL HAVE NO 
PROBLEM IF YOU HAVE LESS THAN THAT 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS STRUGGLE TO 
GET A MORTGAGE 
WHAT CAN YOU DO NOW 
I NLY THING 
THAT I CAN DO IS TO WAIT AND SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE MARKETS AND 
THE MORTGAGES AND THE PROPERTY 
PRICES IN THE NEXT SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS 
FIRST TIME BUYERS HAVE DROPPED TO 
SIXTEEN PER CENT OF THE MORTGAGE MARKET THAT IS 
THE LOWEST SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY IF THEY 
DON'T GET ON THE BOT OF THE LADDER 
IT MAKE IT IS BOTTOM RUNG OF THE 
LADDER IT MAKES IT HARDER FOR 
EVERYONE TO MOVE UP 
IT IS NOT JUST THE FIRST TIME 
BUYERS THIS YEAR MORE THAN ONE 
MILLION PEOPLE COME TO THE END OF 
FIXED RATE DEAL ON THEIR MORTGAGE 
AND WILL FACE A SHARP JUMP ON THEIR 
MORTGAGE ONE OF THEM IS JOHN 
LONDON L. MET HIM IN THE LAST 
SERIES HE WAS USING HIS HOUSE AS A 
CASH MACHINE 
IF THE HOUSE PRICES FELL I EQUITY 
JOHN HOW ARE YOU DOING HELLO HELLO ANDY 
HOW ARE YOU DOING 
NOT TOO ANDY BAD BAD WHAT 
IS THAT HAT ON YOUR HEAD IT IT IS FROM MY HOLIDAY 
A HOLIDAY 
I SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE 
I COULD NOT AFFORD IT L. WAS MADE REDUNDANT 
JOHN IS ONE OF FOUR THOUSAND REDUNDANT ESTATE AGENTS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR 
JOB FACED WITH A FINANCIAL SHOCK 
AND HAVING TO REMORTGAGE I WONDER 
IF HE HAS HIS TOYS 
YOU STILL GOT THE HOT TUB 
STILL GOT IT 
EXCELLENT THE BAR IS HERE ALL THE 
LUXURIES YEP LUXURIES YEP DON'T YOU FEEL AT SOME POINT YOU 
WILL HAVE TO CUT BACK DEFINITELY DEFINITELY I CAN'T KEEP ON WITH THE LIFESTYLE 
I HAVE GET 
WHAT IS YOUR SITUATION NOW 
IT IS 
NOT GOOD IN AS FAR AS I HAVE NOT 
MET THE PAYMENTS ON CREDIT CARDS 
AND LOANS L. AM GETTING THE CALLS 
THAT IS JUST ONE PAYMENT I HAVE 
MISSED MISSED HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THE LENDERS 
CHASING THEIR PAYMENTS AND THE WAYS 
THAT THEY HAVE OF DOING IT SOME SOME ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE WITH THE WAY 
THEY CHASE IT WILL BE FOUR OR FIVE 
PHONE CALLS A DAY THEY WILL WANT A 
COMMITMENT AS TO WHEN YOU ARE GOING 
TO PAY THEY CALL IT A PAYMENT 
PROMISE 
FOUR OR FIVE CALLS A DAY PROMISE YOU MUST FEEL HAR ASED AFTER THAT 
YOU DO YOU START TO NOT ANSWER 
YOUR PHONE 
THAT ABILITY TO TAP YOUR HOUSE FOR 
EQUITY TO TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF 
YOUR HOUSE REFINANCES PAY OFF THE 
CREDIT BILLS HOW HAS IT BEEN 
AFFECTED 
I CAN'T KEEP TAPPING THE AFFECTED EQUITY LIKE I HAVE DONE BECAUSE 
THE THEY ARE DOWNVALUING IT ALL 
THE TIME NOW 
THE MORTGAGE HAS JUMPED IN INTEREST 
RATES YOU CAME OFF YOUR INITIAL 
DEAL HOW ARE YOU GOING TO COPE 
WITH THAT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO 
WITH THAT 
AT THE MOMENT THE 
INTEREST RAILTRACK IS RATE IS EIGHT PER CENT 
OR NINE PER CENT THE PAYMENT HAS GONE UP FROM 
EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY TO OVER ONE THOUSAND L. HAVE TO 
REMORTGAGE IMMEDIATALLY TO STOP 
THAT PAYMENT JUMPING 
THE SOURCE OF THE EXTRA PRESSURE ON 
THE BORROWERS IS THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
WE ARE IN AN UNPRECEDENTED 
SITUATION THE BANK OF 
INTEREST RATE IS BLOW WHAT IT WAS A 
YEAR AGO WHICH SHOULD MEAN CHEAPER 
MORTGAGES BUT THE LENDERS' RATES 
ON NEW LOANS HAVE GONE UP INSTEAD 
OF COMPETING TO LEND TO US THEY 
ARE COMPETING NOT TO WHY IS THAT 
THE REASON IS THE LENDERS ARE 
FINDING IT HARDER TO MAKE A PROFIT 
BECAUSE IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR 
THEM TO GET THE FUNDS TO LEND THE 
BANGS WILL NOT LEND TO EACH OTHER 
AT BANK OF ENGLAND'S RATE WHICH 
THEY WOULD DO BECAUSE OF THE FEAR 
FACTOR IT IS AS IF THE BANKERS ARE 
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER SAYING I'M 
AFRAID TO LEND TO YOU I DON'T KNOW 
HOW MANY BILLIONS YOU HAVE LOST I 
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY I HAVE 
LOST I WILL HORDE MY CASH THAT 
IS Q. I. THE WHY THE FUNDS HAVE 
BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE 
SO WHERE HAVE THE BANKS BEEN 
LOSING ALL OF THIS MONEY AMERICA AMERICA IS HOME NOT ONLY TO MILKY MOUSE 
BUT MICKEY MOUSE BUT ALSO THE 
HOMEOWNERS IN THE U. K. THERE HAS 
BEEN A MASSIVE RISE IN THE NUMBER 
OF REPOSSESSIONS IN THE U. S. THE 
BANKS ARE SELLING OFF PROPERTY AT 
BARGAIN PRICES WHERE THE HOUSES 
ARE CHEAP RAJ WILL NOT BE FAR AWAY 
THE MARKET IS ON THE FLOOR PEOPLE 
CANNOT MOVE THEY CANNOT GET A LOAN 
THEY CANNOT REFINANCES A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE SELLING AS THE INTEREST 
RATES ON MORTGAGES HAVE CHANGED 
DRAMATICALLY THERE COMES A TIME 
WHEN THE PROPERTY GOES DOWN WHICH 
IT HAS DONE HERE BY A LOT WHETHER 
IT BECOMES SUCH GREAT VALUE FOR 
MONEY YOU HAVE TO DIVE IN WHY WHY FLORIDA IS IT JUST BECAUSE IT IS A 
BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO BE 
YOU HAVE FIVE 
MILLION TOURIST COMING HERE BECAUSE 
OF MICKEY MOUSE AND THE ORLANDO 
AREA IT IS FANTASTIC FOR RENTALS 
RAJ AS ORGANISED SOME TYPICALLY 
UNDERSTATED TRANSPORT THIS IS NOT 
A CAR IT IS HOUSE RAJ AND HIS 
MORTGAGE BROKER STEVEN SMITT IS OFF 
ARE OFF IN SEARCH OF A BARGAIN 
LOOK AT THIS THIS HAS THE WOW 
FACTOR FACTOR YES AND IT IS IN CLOSE PRX IMITY 
TO THE PARKS 
ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE COMING FROM 
ABROAD 
THAT IS NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF THE ABROAD CLIENTELE PROPERTY VALUES HAVE 
COME DOWN RIGHT NOW IF YOU KNOW 
THE RIGHT PLACES TO LOOK AND THE 
RIGHT PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH YOU CAN 
CAPITALISE CAPITALISE SO THIS IS IT THIS IS THE ONE YOU 
ARE INTERESTED IN 
YES HOW ABOUT 
THAT THAT FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
VERY GOOD 
IS THAT WANT COUNTS 
AS THIS WAS 
RECENTLY TAKEN OVER BY THE BANK 
THE LISTING AGENT HAD IT LISTED AT 
FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS ZERO THAT IS FOR MARKET VALUE 
IT IS RE PRICED NOW IT IS WITH THE 
BANK IN THE RESEARCH I HAVE DONE 
THE SIMILAR PROPERTIES PROPERTIES 
ARE SELLING FOR THREE DOLLARS THIRTY THOUSAND 
THAT IS GOOD 
FOR SIX BED REMAINS 
YES SO IF WE 
WERE TO PLACE AN OFFER ON THE 
PROPERTY WE WOULD PLACE AN OFFER 
OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR OFFER THE ASKING 
PRICE PRICE SO FOR THE PRICE OF A ONE BED 
REMAIN FLAT RAJ COULD BUY A SIX 
BED REMAIN FLAT WITH A POOL AND 
SUNSHINE ALL YEAR ROUND HOW MUCH 
HAVE THE PRICES FALLEN 
BETWEEN TWENTY PER CENT 
AND THIRTY PER CENT DEPENDING ON HOW 
OVERPRICED THEY WERE TO BEGIN WITH 
THAT IS OVER EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
THAT'S PAINFUL TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT IN EIGHTEEN 
MONTHS DO YOU LIKE THIS ONE RAJ 
I LIKE IT 
THE NUMBERS ARE CLICKING 
IN YOUR HEAD THE PRICE DROPS 
HERE ARE HARD TO BELIEVE WITH MORE 
FALLS PREDICTED RAJ IS TAKING A BIT 
OF A RISK THE MORE REBORROWERS 
BORROWS THE MORE HE IS VULNERABLE 
TO THE PRICE FALLS HOW DID THE 
AMERICAN MARKET GET INTO THE MESS 
TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT HAPPENED YOU 
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE SUB PRIME 
MARKET THINK OF THE MORTGAGE 
MARKET AS A SLAB OF MEAT ON THE 
ONE HAND YOU HAVE THE PRIME CUT 
THE GOOD BORROWERS THE ONES THAT 
ALL THE BANKS WANT TO LEND TO 
BECAUSE THEY'LL GET THEIR MONEY 
BACK ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE 
SCRAGIER MEAT IN THE PAST THE 
BANKS WOULD NOT TOUCH THEM WITH A 
BARGE POLE BUT THEN THEY GOOD A 
LITTLE GREEDY THEY CHARGED THEM A 
SLIGHTLY HIGHER RATE OF INTEREST 
AND THEN THEY CHOPPED UP ALL THE 
DEBT THEY COMBINED A SCRAGY BIT A 
PRIME BIT AND PARCELED IT UP AND 
SOLD IT OFF AND EFFECTIVELY WASHED 
THEIR HANDS OF IT BECAUSE THE 
BANKS SOLD ON THE DEBT THEY 
WEREN'T THE ONES COLLECTING THE 
REPAYMENT ANY MORE WHAT DID IT 
MATTER TO THEM IF PEOPLE DEFAULTED 
IT MEANT IN THE RUSH FOR THE NEW 
BUSINESS IN A BOOMING HOUSING 
MARKET PEOPLE WERE GIVEN MORTGAGES 
THEY COULD NOT AFFORD TO PAY THEY 
DEFAULTED AND IT FLOODED ON TO THE 
HOUSING MARKET ALL THAT SPREAD 
AROUND THE GLOBE THE MORNINGS THAT 
BOUGHT THIS MAY ULTIMATELY HAVE 
COME FROM YOUR PENSION FUND OR BANK 
THIS GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW BIG THE 
PROBLEM OF REPOSSESSIONS IS HERE 
THERE'S A BUS TOUR TO TAKE YOU 
AROUND ALL THE HOUSES TO SEE IF 
THERE'S ONE YOU WANT TO PICK UP AND 
BUY BUY GUYS THANK YOU FOR COMING ALONG TO 
THE TOUR FORECLOSURE BUS THE 
TOUR IS RUN BY ESTATE AGENTS 
DESPERATE TO GENERATE SALES IT IS 
A FOUR BEDROOM TWO BATTLE ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN SQUARE 
FEET AND THE PRICE ON THIS IS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS 
IT HAS ATTRACTED A MIXTURE OF SMALL 
TIME INVESTORS AND PEOPLE 
SEARCHING FOR A BARGAIN FAMILY HOME 
BRAND NEW YOU CAN SMELL THE NEW 
CAR PITS 
CARPETS 
THE ASKING PRICE IS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS 
IS IT REALISTIC FOR US TO MAKE AN 
OFFER OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS 
I THINK YOU CAN PUT 
AN OFFER IN OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE DOLLARS AND YOU MIGHT 
SETTLE AT ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS L. THINK YOU HAVE A 
PRETTY GOOD CHANCE AT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE 
YOU NOTICE A BIT STRANGE KNOWING UP 
UNTIL JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO 
THIS WAS SOMEONE'S FAMILY HOME YOU 
CAN SEE THE IMPRINT ON THE CARPET 
OF THE SOFA AND THINGS THEY HAVE 
TAKEN THE PLATE AROUND THE LIGHT 
SWITCH AND THE PLATE AROUND THE 
SOCKET REALLY IT IS STRANGE YOU 
FEEL A BIT LIKE A VULTURE CIRCLING 
THE PROPERTIES IS THIS THE KIND OF 
PLACE ANY OF YOU WOULD BE 
INTERESTED IN AS A INVESTMENT IT IT WOULD AS A PRIMARY RESIDENCE AND A 
FAMILY NEIGHBOURHOOD AND THE PRICE 
I MEAN IT'S COMPARED TO WHAT IT WAS 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO PROBABLY 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE ALL WE'RE DOING IS 
GOING TO SEE BANK OWNED HOMES 
THERE'S NOBODY LIVING IN THESE 
FAEMS HOMES 
DOES THAT MAKES IT 
EASIER THE FACT YOU DON'T SEE THE 
FAMILY 
OF COURSE I DON'T WANT FAMILY THAT MORAL DILEMMA 
THAT BUS TOUR 
UNNERVED ME NOT JUST OF THE SIZE 
OF THE PRICE FALLS BUT BECAUSE OF 
THE SHEER NUMBER OF FORECLOSURES 
THEY SAY IN FLORIDA ALONE THE 
NUMBER OF REPOSSESSIONS INCREASED 
BY SEVENTY PER CENT IN THE LAST YEAR YOU CAN'T 
HELP BUT WONDER IF WHAT HAPPENS 
HERE WILL EVENTUALLY HAPPEN BACK 
HOME AS WELL 
THIS ISN'T AMERICA REPOSSESSIONS 
ARE UP SHARPLY BUT NOTHING LIKE IN 
THE U. S. YET WHAT LENDERS HERE ARE 
DOING IS USING THE LEGAL THREAT OF 
REPOSSESSION MORE THAN ANY TIME 
SINCE THE LAST RECESSION HOW QUICK 
ARE THEY TO MAKE THAT THREAT I I HAVE HEARD GOOD NEWS ABOUT ANDY AND 
SARAH SARAH HAS FOUND WORK THAT'S 
GREAT THE TROUBLE IS YOU HAVE TO 
WAIT FOR THEIR WAGES IN THE 
MEANTIME THEY ARE IN ARREARS WILL 
THE LENDER BE PATIENT ENOUGH TO 
WAIT FOR THE MONEY TO COME IN WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON 
WE HAVE HAD A 
LETTER THIS MORNING BASICALLY SAID 
WE HAVE GOT TO CLEAR THE ARREARS IN 
FULL OTHERWISE THE SOLICITORS WILL 
HAVE THE DETAILS IN SEVEN DAYS 
THIS IS ABOUT THE MAIN MORTGAGE 
YEAH YOU'LL BE REFERRED TO THE 
LEGAL DEPARTMENT YOUR HOME IS AT 
RISK YOU'LL BE LIABLE FOR FEES AND 
COSTS IT IS REALLY REALLY 
DISAPPOINTING TO FIND YOURSELF 
STILL STRUGGLING AND HERE YOU ARE 
THEY ARE PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON 
YOU DO THEY KNOW YOU HAVE FOUND 
WORK DID YOU SAY PLEASE GIVE ME A 
FEW WEEKS 
ALL THEY SAY IS THEY 
WILL ADD IT TO THE NOTES THEY WILL

WHATSOEVER BECAUSE I'VE GOT A JOB 
WE PHONED THEM THE DAY WE GOT THE 
LETTER TO TRY AND SORT IT OUT BUT 
THEY WON'T HELP US UNTIL THE SEVEN 
DAYS HAS GONE 
OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T 
PAY IN THAT TIME THIS IS THE 
BEGINNING OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
TO REPOSSESSION I'M CONCERNED THAT 
FACING THE THREAT OF REPOSSESSION 
ANDY AND SARAH MIGHT BE DRIVEN INTO 
THE ARMS OF AN UNREGULATED MORTGAGE 
RESCUE SCHEME THEY ARE ONE OF THE 
SIXTEEN THREE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS HOUSEHOLDS WHO 
HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE COURTS I'VE 
COME TO THE BANKING WORLD TO FIND 
OUT WHY SO MANY DELETS OF LEGAL 
ACTION ARE MADE WE KNOW OUR 
ABILITY TO PAY OUR MORTGAGES IT 
MAY BE GETTING WORSE BUT NOT THAT 
MUCH WORSE WHEREAS THE CLAIMS FOR 
REPOSSESSION GOING THROUGH THE 
COURTS ARE AT THEIR HIGHEST SINCE 
THE EARLY OH NINE'S 
THOSE NUMBERS WILL 
BE GOING UP BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY 
PEOPLE ARE UNDER PRESSURE ARREARS 
ARE RISING LENDERS WILL GO TO 
COURT TO BEGIN THE PROCESS WHAT 
YOU'LL FIND A RELATIVELY BIG NUMBER 
IN THE COURT PROCESS BUT THE 
NUMBERS THAT FINALLY LOSE THEIR 
HOMES IS SMALLER 
ARE THEY TRYING 
TO SCARE PEOPLE PEOPLE INTO PAYING 
THEY'RE TRYING TO FOLLOW A PROCESS 
ABOUT TREATING CUSTOMERS FAIRLY 
AND THERE'S PROCESS AROUND 
ARREARS IT'S ABOUT TREATING 
CUSTOMERS INDIVIDUALLY AND 
SYMPATHETICLY AND ARRIVING AROUND A 
AT FAIR RESULT 
THERE ARE MANY 
MORTGAGE HOLDERS IN THE U. K. THE 
FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY HAS 
GIVEN US THREE SIMPLE QUESTIONS IF 
THE ANSWER TO ALL THREE IS YES 
THEN YOU COULD LIT 
PROBLEMS PAYING 
THEN YOU COULD LIT PROBLEMS PAYING YOUR MORTGAGE DO YOU HAVE A VERY 
BIG MORTGAGE YES 
IS YOUR MORTGAGE YES HIGHER THAN THE SALE PRICE OF YOUR 
PROPERTY A ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGE YE DO YE DO YOU HAVE CREDIT CARDS 
I HAVE A 
LOAN IT DOESN'T AFFECT ME IN ANY 
WAY WAY DOES IT MAKE YOU ANXIOUS YES THE 
REASON I BOUGHT A HOUSE TO BE ABLE 
TO SUPPORT MY FAMILY I WANTED TO 
GET MARRIED SOON 
TO SUPPORT MY FAMILY I WANTED TO GET MARRIED SOON 
F. HOUSE PRICES 
GET MARRIED SOON F. HOUSE PRICES FALL 
HOW HOW BIG IS YOUR FALL MORTGAGE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND 
THE BIGGEST MORTGAGE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND WORRY IS YOU CAN SELL YOU A HOUSE 
IN A DAY IN LONDON I WASN'T 
WORRIED IF YOU LOST YOUR JOB YOU 
COULD SELL IT IF YOU LOST YOUR JOB 
WITH A SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND IT COULD TAKE A 
YEAR TO SELL THE HOUSE I'M I'M FORTUNATE I HAVE A SMALL MORTGAGE 
YOU HAVE HOW MUCH EQUITY IN YOUR 
PROPERTY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
HOW MUCH OF PROPERTY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND YOUR MORTGAGE IS IT THE SAME AS 
YOUR PROPERTY YES WAS A FIRST YES TIME BUYER 
HAVE YOU GOT ANY OTHER 
LOANS YES DO YOU WORRY ABOUT 
HOUSE PRICES FALLING 
CAN'T WORRY 
ABOUT EVERYTHING NO NOT VERY MUCH 
WHAT THE VALUE OF YOUR MORTGAGE 
HOUSE LOT MORE THAN THE MORTGAGE 
PROBABLY MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND YOU YOU HAVE A NICE CUSHION PRICES WOULD 
HAVE TO FALL BY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BEFORE 
THEY AFFECT YOU THOSE AT RISK CAN 
HANDLE PRICES FALLING IF THEY KEEP 
UP THEIR PAYMENTS ARREARS ARE UP 
BY A THIRD THERE'S STILL A TINY 
FRACTION OF MORTGAGE BORROWERS 
PERHAPS THE NEXT BIGGEST FEAR IS 
THE RISK OF NERVE EQUITY LOOK AT 
THE OUTSTANDING STANDING MORTGAGE 
SET AGAINST THE VALUE OF YOUR HOME 
THIS REPRESENTS THE VALUE OF YOUR 
HOME THE AVERAGE MORTGAGE IS FORTY FOUR PER CENT 
OF THAT HOUSE PRICES WOULD HAVE TO 
FALL BY THIS MUCH TO PUT THE 
AVERAGE BORROWER IN TROUBLE NO 
SERIOUS ECONOMIST IS PREDICTEDING 
THAT SOME ECONOMISTS ARE 
PREDICTING THEY'LL FALL BY EIGHTY PER CENT YOU 
MORTGAGE HAS TO BE EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE 
PROPERTY NEGATIVE EQUITY ONLY 
BITES WHEN YOU HAVE TO SELL NOR 
LESS THAN YOU SELL FOR THE IF YOU 
STAY PUT THEN IT SHOULD NOT AFFECT 
YOU IF YOU AREN'T AT RISK OF 
REPOSSESSION OR NEGATIVE EQUITY 
ARE YOU CRASH PROOF OR DO PRICE 
FALLS SIL DAMAGE YOUR WEALTH UNTIL 
YOU BUY OR SELL THEY MAKE NO 
MATERIAL DIFFERENCE WHEN PRICES 
FALL IF YOU ARE BUYING YOU CAN GET 
MORE PROPERTY ON YOUR MONEY THAT 
BENEFITS EVERYBODY MOVING UP TO A 
BETTER HOME YOU'LL LOSE A CERTAIN 
AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THE PRICE PLACE 
YOU'RE SELLING BUT YOU'LL SAVE 
MORE ON THE APPROPRIATE YOU'RE 
BUYING THINK OF IT AS THE RUNGS OF 
THE PROPERTY MUCH A LADDER IT 
GETS CLOSER IT'S OKAY FOR HIM 
NOW 
OUT HERE WE HAVE THE FAMILY WE HAD 
A NEW BORN BABY A WEEK AGO 
THAT IS MATTHEW THE HOUSEHOLD IS 
GROWING GROWING DO YOU REGRET BUYING 
I REGRET IT 
FINANCIALLY IF YOU HAD A CISZ TAL 
BALL YOU WOULD NOT BUY IT WILL BE 
WORTH LESS THAN IT WAS THEN 
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT IS WORTH 
IF WE WANTED TO SELL IN A HURRY WE 
WOULD HAVE TO ACCEPT LESS THAN WHAT 
WE PAID FOR IT 
WE PHONED A LOCAL ESTATE AGENT AND 
ASKED THEM WHAT THEY THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE THEY SAID TO PUT IT ON 
THE MARKET FOR TWENTY THOUSAND BUT YOU 
COULD GET LESS THAN THAT 
YES THAT IS RIGHT OBVIOUSLY WE 
DON'T GET THE TAX BACK HOWEVER HOWEVER NICK HAS WORKED OUT THAT FALLING 
PRICES COULD BE GOOD FOR HIM AND 
HIS FAMILY IN MARCH THIS LARGE 
DETACHED HOUSE WAS ON THE MARKET 
FOR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PUTTING IT BEYOND 
NICK'S PRICE RANGE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK NICK 
IT IS 
SUPERB THE SORT OF PLACE WE WOULD 
BE LOOKING TO UPGRADE TO 
WE SHOULD GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM 
LINE HOW MUCH IS IT ON THE MARKET 
FOR 
FOR SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR SO DROPPED BY ALMOST FIFTY THOUSAND 
THEY HAVE DONE IT RECENTLY 
STRAIGHT AWAY THEY ARE SEEING THE 
FRUITS FOR THAT THERE IS NOW A 
STREAM OF PEOPLE COMING AND HAVING 
A LOOK FOR A GARDEN CITY HOUSE IT 
IS GREAT VALUE 
YOU WOULD SAY THAT YOU ARE AN 
ESTATE AGENT HAS HE CONFIPBSED 
CONVINCED YOU 
WE LOSE ON HOUR 
HOUSE BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF OUR 
THE HOUSE WE WANT TO BUY IS 
DROPPING 
IF YOU HOUSE HAS GONE DROPPING DOWN ABOUT TEN THOUSAND IF THEY PUT IT 
ON AT THE SAME PRICE THIS HOUSE 
HAS COME DOWN BY FIFTY THOUSAND 
THAT'S RIGHT IF THE PRICES 
CONTINUE TO DROP FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
WE COULD FIND SUITABLE HOUSE THAT 
WOULD BE GOOD FOR OUR FAMILY SO SO YOU WANT THE PRICES TO COME DOWN 
MORE EXACTLY 
SO STAYING PUT OR UPSIZING YOU 
SHOULD NOT LOSE 
BJORN IS A DOWNSIZER HE IS SELLING 
HIS STUNNING TUDOR HOME BUT THE 
DOWNTURN IN PROPERTY PRICES HAS 
WIPED THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OFF THE VALUE 
HERE IS MY PRIVATE DINING ROOM 
WHAT A DINING ROOM 
FANTASTIC ISN'T IT THIS IS A 
LOVELY DINING PLACE THIS IS WHERE 
MY PRIVATE GUESTS COME THIS IS A 
JACOBEAN STAIRCASE 
AND WHAT TOILET 
I WILL TAKE YOU 
TO THE BEDROOM WHERE THE GHOSTS 
ARE ARE THE GHOSTS ADD B. D. S. TEN THOUSAND TO THE 
PRICE FOR THE GROSTS 
MUSH MORE THAN THAT 
THERE HE IS THIS IS FRED FRED IN 
NORWEGIAN MEANS PEACE HE IS A 
PEACEFUL GUY 
YOU HAVE HAD TO CUT 
THE PRICE DOWN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
BUT I BOUGHT IT FOR TWENTY THOUSAND 
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE 
IF YOU 
BUY SOMETHING CHEAP SIT ON IT THE 
MONEY WILL BE THERE YOU WILL 
ALWAYS HAVE A PROFIT 
THIS IS MONOR HOUSE 
YES BUT A 
HOUSE THAT WAS FALLING DOWN AND 
NEEDED SOMEONE TO TAKE IF ON AND 
LOVE AND CARE FOR IT 
BUT IN A WAY IT IS PEOPLE LIKE YOU 
TRYING TO SELL THAT IS HIT THE 
HARDEST BY THE PRICES FALLING THAT THAT HURTS BUT IN THE SAME WAY DO YOU 
SELL AND THEN START DOING SOMETHING 
ELSE OR DO YOU KEEP IT THAT'S 
REALLY UP TO IF I FEEL IF I EARN 
ENOUGH MONEY CAN I AFFORD TO SELL 
IT FOR ONE POINT FOUR MILLION AND STILL BE 
HAPPY HAPPY FALLING HOUSE PRICES ARE COSTING 
PEOPLE LIKE BJORN A LOT OF MONEY 
BUT THE FUNY THING IS AS HE HAS 
MADE MONEY FROM THE BOOM HE CAN 
AFFORD TO LOSE MONEY IN THE FALLS 
THE PEOPLE WORSE OFF ARE IN MONEY 
CASES ONES MOST STABLE TO 
WITHSTAND IT 
WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE TRULY CRASH 
PROOF COULD ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON 
SOMETHING BEYOND YOUR CONTROL THE 
ECONOMY AT THE MOMENT IT IS 
HOLDING UP RELATIVELY WELL MOST 
IMPORTANTLY EMPLOYMENT IS GOOD 
THAT COULD CHANGE IF WE START 
SPENDING LESS AS HOUSE PRICES FALL 
MAYBE AS WE ARE FEELING LESS 
CONFIDENT OR FEELING LESS WEALTHY 
THEN BUSINESSES WOULD SUFFER 
PEOPLE WOULD LOSE THEIR 
WITH THEM THEIR HOMES THAT WOULD 
CAUSE THE HOUSE PRICES TO FALL MORE 
AND THEN YOU ARE IN DANGER OF 
SETTING OFF THIS DOWN WARD SPIRAL 
IS THAT HAPPENING THE EVIDENCE IS 
MIXED WHAT WE ARE CUTTING BACK ON 
IS BIG PURCHASES LIKE FURNITURE 
AND HOME IMPROVEMENT WHERE YOU MAY 
PAY FOR IT BY BORROWING MORE 
AGAINST YOUR HOME 
WITH HIS HOUSE FALLING IN VALUE 
JOHN LONDON'S FOUND HE CAN NO 
LONGER TAP THE EQUITY ON IT HE 
CANNOT PAY OFF HIS DEBT AND HE HAS 
FALLEN INTO I REARS HAS HIS TASTE 
FOR LUXURY FALLEN INTO THE PAST I I HAVE TO PAY OFF MONEY THAT I OWE L. 
WANT TO TURN OFF A NEW LEAF AND 
CURB MY SPENDING WHICH I HAVE 
STARTED TO DO BUT THIS IS THE NEXT 
STEP L. L. DEFINITELY HAVE LESS MONEY 
IN MY POCKET THESE DAYS I NEVER 
HAD THE MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE 
IT WAS ON CREDIT CARDS GADGETS AND 
BITS AND BOBS THAT I WOULD BUY AND 
I DID NOT NEED L. AM NOT PURCHASING 
LIKE I USED TO 
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE MAY BE AT ITS 
LOWEST FOR FIFTEEN YEARS BUT WE ARE 
STILL SPENDING MORE ON THE HIGH 
STREET THAN LAST YEAR A LEADING 
ESTATE AGENT RECKONS THAT THERE ARE 
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT AFRAID 
OF A CRASH FOR GOOD REASONS IT HAS 
DRAWN UP LIST OF WHAT IT SAYS ARE 
THE BEST PLACES TO BUY IF YOU WANT 
TO BE POSSESSION PROOF THE TOP 
THREE PLACES ARE OBVIOUS CAMBRIDGE 
YORK OXFORD BUT NUMBER FOUR MIGHT 
SURPRISE YOU SO THIS IS MILTON 
KEYNES ONCE THE BUT THE OF A FEW 
NATIONAL JOKES FOR ITS PLASTIC COWS 
AND FAMOUS FOR HAVING HUNDREDS OF 
ROUNDABOUTS ROUNDABOUTS THE ESTATE AGENTS' CLAIM IS THAT 
THE HOUSES ARE RELATIVELY 
AFFORDABLE AND THE GOOD EMPLOYMENT 
AND TRANSPORT MAKE IT LESS VBL TO A 
RECESSION RECESSION LESS VULNERABLE TO A RECESSION 
THIS IS TYPICAL MILTON KEYNES 
CLOSE ALL BRAND NEW HOUSES A FEW 
YEARS OLD AT THE MOST 
IT IS SUCH A DESIRABLE AREA TO WORK 
IN PEOPLE ARE FLOCKING TO WORK 
HERE AND LIVE HERE 
WE CAME HERE 
BECAUSE OF THE PROPERTY PRICES WE 
COULD GET A BIGGER HOUSE FOR THE 
SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY 
LOTS OF 
FACILITIES IT IS GOOD FOR THE KIDS 
EACH ESTATE HAS THE SHOPPING CENTRE 
IT HAS SKIING SPORTS CENTRE IT 
HAS SHOPPING CENTRE IT HAS THE LOT 
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED 
UNFORTUNATELY WHATEVER THE ESTATE 
AGENTS TELL YOU THERE IS NO SURE 
FIRE GUARANTEE THAT ANY PARTICULAR 
AREA WILL FAREWELL IN RECESSION 
IF YOU CAN'T BE COMPLACENT ABOUT 
GIVEN LOCATION CAN YOU BE 
CONFIDENT ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL 
PROPERTY L. AM FOUND SOMEONE WHO IS 
SURE HE KNOWS HOW TO RISE ABOVE THE 
PROBLEMS OF THE HOUSING MARKET THE 
ONLY THING IS YOU WILL NEED DEEP

YES ONE THING THAT BUSINESS SCARED ME IS LOSING MY MONEY IN A 
PROPERTY MARKET CRASH L. CAN'T 
CONTROL THE PROPERTY MARKET I 
CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT IT WILL DO SO 
WHAT I DO IS CREATE BY OPERATING IN 
THE TOP MARKETS AND PRODUCING THE 
BEST PICTURES WE ARE INSULATING 
OURSELVES FROM PROPERTY MARKET 
CRASHES CRASHES DAMIAN IS SELLING TO RUSSIAN 
BILLIONAIRE LUXURY HOUSES LIKE 
THIS TEND TO RETAIN THEIR VALUE 
BECAUSE OF THEIR APPEAL TO WEALTHY 
INTERNATIONAL BUYERS 
UNLIKE THE SUPERRICH RAJ SASTRI 
STILL FINANCES HIS PROPERTIES WITH 
A MORTGAGE AS THE PROBLEMS IN THE 
HOUSING MARKET DEEPEN HE IS 
FEELING THE PINCH 
THE MORTGAGE ISSUES HAVE AFFECTED 
ME QUITE A LOT 
WHEREAS THERE WAS THAT MANY 
MORTGAGES IT HAS GONE DOWN TO THAT 
MANY L. WAS DOING A DEAL HALF WAY 
THROUGH IT THE LENDER PULLED THE 
DEAL L. COULD NOT BUY THE PROPERTY 
I COULD NOT FINANCESMENT ON SOME OF 
MY PROPERTIES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF 
A LOW TWO YEAR DEAL ONE OF THEM IN 
PUTNEY THE MORTGAGE HAS GONE UP FOUR 
ZERO A MONTH NOW THE RENTS ARE LESS 
THAN THE MORTGAGE 
CASH FLOW 
PROBLEMS ARE STARTING TO HIT 
PROPERTY COMPANIES IF THEY WERE TO 
GO UNDER WHERE WOULD IT LEAVE THE 
PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES HE HAD BOUGHT 
AND WANTED TO SELL BACK TO THEM IT IT IS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN BUT YOU HAVE 
TO HAVE THE CASH IN CASE ANYTHING 
BAD HAPPENS SO I HAVE BUILT MY 
BUSINESS ON FIRM FOUNDATIONS THAT 
IS VERY UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN 
JOHN LONDON'S FINANCESS ARE LOOKING 
UP HE HAS A NEW JOB WORKING AS 
GUESS WHAT PART TIME MORTGAGE 
ADVISOR IT MAY EXPLAIN HOW HE HAS 
MANAGED TO FIND NEW MORTGAGE DEAL 
FOR HIMSELF 
FINANCESALLY THINGS HAVE IMPROVED 
MY MORTGAGE WENT THROUGH SO I AM 
ON A BETTER RATE THAN I WAS 
I AM NOT PAYING AS MUCH IT HAS PUT 
MONEY BACK INTO MY POCKET L. HAVE 
TIGHTENED MY BELT AS FAR AS MY 
SPENDING IS GOING TO REWARD MYSELF 
I HAVE OFF TO CHINA AT THE END OF 
NEXT MONTH 
I AM OFF TO CHINA AT THE END OF 
NEXT MONTH 
I HAVE NEVER BEEN OFF TO CHINA 
THERE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT 
LIFESTYLES THE CULTURE AND IT IS 
A COUPLE OF MONTHS BEFORE THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES SO I CAN'T WAIT 
BACK IN SHEFFIELD THE SAB R. WB R. K. 
IDGES SAWBRIDGES HAVE RECEIVED 
LETTER FROM THEIR MORTGAGE LENDER 
THE ABBEY 
I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT ANOTHER 
LETTER FROM ABBEY I DREADED 
OPENING IT WHEN WE OPENED IT I 
HAD TO READ IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
I COULD NOT TAKE IT ALL IN SEVEN THEY THEY ARE STOPPING THE COURT ACTION THEY 
ARE APPOINTING US WITH ONE OF 
SOMEBODY FROM ABBEY TO HELP US OUT 
IN IT ALL IT IS BRILLIANT IT HAS 
TAKEN THE PRESSURE OFF US THAT 
FINGER OF ON THIS DAY YOU MAY LOSE 
YOUR HOUSE 
IT MEANS THAT WE DON'T 
HAVE THE TIME THE DEADLINE L. FEEL 
NOW THAT AT LAST WE HAVE THE CHANCE 
NOW TO TURN THINGS AROUND 
THE LENDER ABBEY MAINTAINS THAT 
REPOSSESSION IS LAST RESORT BUT 
SYMPATHETIC TREATMENT IS BEING 
DEMANDED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN 
EXCHANGE FOR LENDING BANKS FIFTY 
BILLION TO HELP WITH THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH CRUNCH IT HAS NOT SUNK IN YET 
WE HAVE NOT 
BEEN THIS HAPPY FOR A LONG TIME L. 
KNOW WE STILL HAVE TO WORRY BUT 
WAS GOOD NEWS FOR ONCE WE OPENED A 
LETTER AND IT WAS NOT YOU OWE US 
THIS 
IT HAS GIVEN US THE DRIVE THIS TO KEEP GOING L. AM REALLY PLEASED 
LENDERS MAY BE UNDER PRESSURE TO BE 
SYMPATHETIC BUT THERE IS FINANCIAL 
PRESSURE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION 
AS AN ECONOMIST I CAN MAKE 
PREDICTION ABOUT WHAT IS GOING IT 
HAPPEN IN THE HOUSING MARKET BUT 
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE CERTAIN 
THE TRUTH ABOUT PROPERTY IS THAT 
MOST OF US HAVE NO NEED TO FEAR 
FALLING HOUSE PRICES UNLESS YOU 
ARE AT RISK OF NEGATIVE EQUITY OR 
PLANNING TO TRADE DOWN THEY DO NOT 
DAMAGE YOUR WEALTH SO F. R. A LOT OF 
US IT IS IRRATIONALAL TO FEAR A 
SLIDING MARKET BUT IF THE FEAR 
TAKES HOLD AND STUPS STOPS US 
FROM SPENDING WE ALL FEEL THE PINCH 
AND THE ECONOMY SLOWS A CRASH 
SHOULD NOT HURT US IF WE FEAR IT 
WE WILL WE USED TO THINK OF 
PROPERTY AS AN ASSET WILL THE 
FALLS PRICES MAKE IT A LIABILITY 
TOMORROW WE ASK IS PROPERTY STILL A 
GOOD LONG TERM BET 
WE SOLD ABOUT 
ONE HUNDRED MILLION WORTH 
WILL IT FUND US IN OLD AGE 
WE ARE 
THINK ING WHAT HAVE WE DONE
