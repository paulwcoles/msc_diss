BUT TODAY'S COUPLE HAVE DONE JUST THAT 
THEY'VE STARTED A BUSINESS THAT'S SITUATED JUST A MILE FROM THEIR HOME 
SO THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE THE HASSLES OF THE OFFICE IS A MOVE TO THE COUNTRY 
WELCOME TO HINCKLEY IN THE HEART OF LEICESTERSHIRE 
IN FACT HINCKLEY IS THE HEART OF ENGLAND AND WAS ONCE THE CENTRE OF THE BRITISH ROMAN EMPIRE 
TODAY IT SITS AT THE CROSSROADS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT NATIONAL TRANSPORT NETWORK 
WITH DIRECT ACCESS TO THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR MOTORWAYS 
SO IT WILL COME AS NO SURPRISE TO LEARN THAT HINCKLEY 
HAS LONG BEEN AT THE CENTRE OF BRITISH MANUFACTURING 
ONCE KNOWN AS THE CRADLE OF THE HOSIERY INDUSTRY 
IT'S STILL HOME TO THE ACCLAIMED TRIUMPH MOTORCYCLE 
AND LIKE A LOT OF CITY CENTRES NOT MANY OLD FACTORIES SURVIVE 
TODAY MANY ARE BEING CONVERTED INTO LOFT STYLE APARTMENTS 
ATTRACTING BOTH AFFLUENT WORKERS AND YOUNG FAMILIES 
IN FACT THE AVERAGE FAMILY HOME FETCHES AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
WHICH IS PART OF THE THE REASON TODAY'S FAMILY ARE KEEN TO MOVE 
PAUL'S CONSERVATORY BUSINESS IS JUST A STONE'S THROW FROM HOME 
WHICH WAS IDEAL WHEN HE SET UP THE COMPANY 
BUT NOW HE FINDS IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE HOME FROM OFFICE 
WE'RE NEVER AWAY FROM WORK IT'S ALWAYS HERE 
WE'VE GIVEN IT A LOT OF CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND DECIDED 
THE BEST THING TO DO WAS TO MOVE INTO THE COUNTRY 
THE BUSINESS WILL BE ABLE TO RUN ITSELF 
RON RUNS THE OFFICE AND CARL RUNS THE INSULATION SIDE 
WE'VE GOT A GREAT TEAM AND I KNOW IT WILL RUN ITSELF 
I'LL STILL BE INVOLVED IN THE BUSINESS 
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO LIVE SOMEWHERE WITH COUNTRYSIDE LIKE THIS ME 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL YEAH 
HAVING BOTH GROWN UP IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
PAUL AND PAULA WANT THE SAME FOR THEIR THREE CHILDREN 
HOLLY ANNE LAURENCE AND MADDIE 
WE FEEL WE'RE NOT GIVING OUR CHILDREN THE BEST CHANCE WE CAN IN LIFE 
ALTHOUGH IT'S CONVENIENT HERE THERE IS SO MUCH MORE WE COULD OFFER THEM 
BY LIVING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE WE COULD DO MORE AS A FAMILY 
HAVING LOVELY FAMILY WALKS WITH ALL THE FRESH AIR AWAY FROM THE TRAFFIC POLLUTION 
WE REALISE THE IMPORTANCE OF TIME TOGETHER WITH THE KIDS 
AND HOW MUCH WE WANT TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN TIME TOGETHER WITH OURSELVES 
AND GIVE THEM THE THINGS THAT WE WANT THAT WE HAD AS CHILDREN 
PAULA MOVED IN WITH PAUL TEN YEARS AGO 
AND HAS MADE VAST IMPROVEMENTS BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY 
THE HOUSE ORIGINALLY COST THIRTY THREE THOUSAND AND THEY HAVE EXTENDED IT 
TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR EVER GROWING FAMILY 
SO LET'S SEE IF THAT EXTENSION HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED THE VALUE OF THE HOUSE 
ON ENTERING THE PROPERTY 
THERE IS A SEPARATE CLOAKROOM NEXT TO THE SPACIOUS LOBBY AREA 
A GUEST ROOM CUM OFFICE IS LOCATED RIGHT OPPOSITE THE LIVING AREA 
THE FAMILY BREAKFAST AREA IS SITUATED INSIDE THE LIVING ROOM 
WITH A LARGE GALLEY STYLE KITCHEN BEYOND 
THE LARGE OPEN PLAN LIVING ROOM LEADS TO THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
WITH AN ADDITIONAL TOILET NEXT DOOR 
AND ALONG THE CORRIDOR THE FIRST OF THE CHILDREN'S BEDROOMS 
WITH THE SECOND LOCATED FURTHER ALONG THE CORRIDOR 
BEYOND THE FORMAL DINING ROOM IS A LIGHT AND SPACIOUS EXTENSION 
THIS CONSERVATORY IS A FANTASTIC SELLING POINT FOR THE HOUSE 
IT REALLY BRINGS THE GARDEN INTO THE HOUSE AND IT ADDS VALUE 
A LARGE GARDEN AND SUMMER HOUSE IS TO THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY 
BACK INSIDE AND UP THE STAIRS IS A USEFUL LANDING AREA 
WHICH IS LOCATED NEXT TO THE NURSERY AND FINALLY THE MASTER BEDROOM SUITE 
SO PAUL AND PAULA WE'VE HAD THE VALUATION DONE ON THIS PROPERTY 
YOU BOUGHT THE HOUSE ORIGINALLY DIDN'T YOU YES 
FOR THIRTY THREE THOUSAND YES 
THE ESTATE AGENTS RECKON WE CAN GET UP TO TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR IT 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN THAT 
THAT MAY BE JUST A VERY REALISTIC VALUATION WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT YOU WOULD SELL IT QUICKLY YES 
IT'S UP TO YOU WHAT YOU MARKET IT AT 
PAULA WHAT IS THE BUDGET FOR THE BIG MOVE 
IT'S FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT IF WE REALLY FELL IN LOVE WITH THE PROPERTY 
WE COULD PUSH TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
RIGHT SO WHERE EXACTLY WOULD YOU LIKE TO MOVE TO 
DORSET SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF THE POOLE AREA 
THERE'S A VILLAGE CALLED LYTCHETT MATRAVERS THAT WE LOVE JUST NORTH OF POOLE 
LET'S RUN THROUGH YOUR LIST OF ESSENTIALS HOW MANY BEDROOMS DO YOU NEED 
FOUR REALLY BUT IF WE COULD FIND TWO BEDROOM THREE BEDROOM WE COULD EXTEND 
THAT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY 
PAUL ARE THERE ANY OTHER ROOMS WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL 
A COUPLE OF RECEPTION ROOMS DEFINITELY AN OFFICE 
WE WOULD LIKE THE ADDITION OF A CONSERVATORY AT SOME POINT 
THIS GARDEN IS GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER 
IT NEEDS TO HAVE SPACE FOR A CONSERVATORY AND A TRAMPOLINE IF POSSIBLE YES 
THE IF POSSIBLE WORDS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE CALLED INTO PLAY MAKES IT HARDER DOESN'T IT 
SO THAT'S THE PROPERTY WHAT ABOUT THE LOCATION 
YOU SAID YOU'D LIKE TO BE WITHIN THIRTY MINUTES OF THE COAST PAULA 
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE AMENITIES WISE NEARBY 
DEFINITELY THE SCHOOL IS THE MAJOR PRIORITY THREE YOUNG CHILDREN 
WALKING DISTANCE WOULD BE LOVELY 
STAY LOGGED ON TO THE LAPTOP BECAUSE I'LL SEND YOU PICTURES OF THE PROPERTIES 
AND YOU CAN GIVE ME A CALL AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF WHAT I'M FINDING SO FAR 
I'LL DO MY VERY BEST TO FIND EVERYTHING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ON THE LIST GOOD LUCK 
THANK YOU 
WELL PAUL AND PAULA HAVE GOT A SCARILY LONG LIST OF ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS 
AND THEY HAVE CHOSEN A VERY POPULAR AREA OF THE COUNTRY 
SO I THINK COMPROMISE WILL BE THE KEY WORD IN THIS PROPERTY SEARCH 
WITH A BUDGET OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
AND A WISH LIST AS LONG AS MY ARM I'VE GOT MY WORK CUT OUT 
PAUL AND PAULA ARE AFTER A FOUR BEDROOM PROPERTY 
WITH TWO RECEPTION ROOMS AND A GARDEN TO HOUSE A CONSERVATORY 
FULL SIZE TRAMPOLINE AND AMPLE LAWN 
BONUSES WOULD INCLUDE A SCHOOL WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE 
AND ADEQUATE SPORTS FACILITIES 
CLOSE BY 
THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTY OF DORSET OFFERS BREATHTAKING COUNTRYSIDE 
AND A DRAMATIC COASTLINE DATING BACK A STAGGERING ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION YEARS 
WHICH MAKES IT A REGULAR HAUNT OF FOSSIL HUNTERS HOPING FOR AN HISTORIC FIND 
FIVE MILLION TOURISTS WILL WALK THESE FOOTPATHS AND TRAILS EVERY YEAR 
AS POOLE HARBOUR MARKS THE START OF THE SIX HUNDRED THIRTY MILE COASTAL PATH 
HAVING RECENTLY GAINED WORLD HERITAGE SITE STATUS 
IT MAY COME AS A SURPRISE THAT DORSET NOW RANKS ALONGSIDE THE PYRAMIDS 
THE GRAND CANYON AND THE GREAT BARRIER REEF 
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PROPERTY IT'S UP THERE WITH TOKYO LONDON AND NEW YORK 
THE SANDBANKS PENINSULA IS THE COUNTY'S VERY OWN MILLIONAIRE'S ROW 
LITTLE WONDER THEN THAT HOUSE PRICES ARE NEARLY TWENTY PER CENT ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE 
MY SEARCH BEGINS IN THE TINY VILLAGE OF SHILLINGSTONE 
TWENTY MILES NORTH OF POOLE JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE BLACKMORE VALE 
ONE THING THE TOMKINS WON'T FIND THEMSELVES SHORT OF AROUND HERE ARE SPECTACULAR VIEWS 
IT'S SURROUNDED BY ROLLING COUNTRYSIDE 
SO WHEN PAULA'S DOING THE WASHING UP 
SHE'LL MORE THAN LIKELY BE LOOKING ONTO FARM TRAFFIC RATHER THAN THE RUSH HOUR 
BUILT IN TWO THOUSAND TWO BROCK HOUSE IS A SUBSTANTIAL FOUR BEDROOM DETACHED HOME 
AND IS ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
LOVELY THAT IS VERY NICE 
THE CURRENT OWNER SARAH WARMBY IS GOING TO SHOW ME AROUND 
WE COME INTO A GOOD SIZE HALLWAY HERE WITH THE STAIRS LEADING OFF IT YES 
IT LOOKS LIKE A NICE STAIRCASE 
THAT'S THE SITTING ROOM THROUGH THERE YES THAT'S THE MAIN LOUNGE 
WE HAVE A SMALLER LOUNGE AROUND THE CORNER SHALL WE GO THIS WAY FIRST 
YES FINE WHAT HAVE WE GOT IN HERE 
THAT'S JUST A DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM QUITE A GOOD SIZE 
THROUGH HERE THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL YOUR SMALLER SITTING ROOM 
YES THIS IS WE'VE JUST CONVERTED IT 
OFFICIALLY IT'S A STUDY BUT WE JUST WANTED A SMALLER T. V. ROOM 
THAT'S A NICE LITTLE SIZE NICE CHILDREN'S PLAYROOM OR T. V. LOUNGE 
I THINK FOR MY FAMILY IT WOULD HAVE TO BE TURNED BACK INTO A STUDY 
BE PERFECT FOR YOU WOULDN'T IT IT WOULD BE GREAT THAT WOULD 
LET'S CARRY ON THROUGH 
GOSH LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS 
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE JOY TO MY FAMILY'S EYES 
BECAUSE THEY ARE DESPERATE FOR A BIGGER KITCHEN OH RIGHT 
THAT'S LOVELY LOOK AT THAT FOR SPACE JUST WHAT WE WANT 
ANOTHER THING THAT PAULA WILL LOVE IS THIS BIG WINDOW IT'S VERY LIGHT IN HERE 
YES IT IS A NICE PLACE TO BE STANDING DOING YOUR WASHING UP 
WE'RE COMING ROUND IN A CIRCLE TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE YES 
A PROPER DINING ROOM YOU DON'T SEE THESE OFTEN 
THAT'S A BONUS ISN'T IT 
IT IS AS WELL IT'S A NICE SIZE 
YOU COULD GET A NICE LARGE FAMILY TABLE IN THERE 
IF MY FAMILY FELT THEY DIDN'T REALLY NEED A SEPARATE DINING ROOM 
THEY COULD USE THIS AS A PLAY ROOM DEFINITELY 
IT WOULD BE AN IDEAL CHILDREN'S ROOM AS WELL WOULDN'T IT 
WELL IF THAT'S A GOOD SIZE THIS IS A VERY GOOD SIZE 
MY FAMILY LIKE PERIOD HOUSES 
BUT THEY WERE WORRIED THAT SOMETIMES PERIOD HOUSES CAN BE A BIT POKEY 
THE BIG ADVANTAGE OF A NEW BUILD IS THAT YOU CAN GET THE DIMENSIONS THAT YOU WANT YES 
THAT'S JUST WHAT WE WANT LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT 
WE'RE USED TO A LARGE LOUNGE WE'D MISS IT WITHOUT ONE YEAH 
I'M NOTICING YOU'VE GOT FRENCH DOORS THERE OUT INTO THE GARDEN 
YES WE HAVE DO YOU NOT USE THOSE 
WE DO IT'S JUST IN THE WINTER WE PUT THAT THERE AND THEN IN THE SUMMER WE'D OPEN UP 
IT'S A NICE FEATURE TO HAVE FRENCH DOORS IN THE GARDEN ISN'T IT 
YEAH I DO LIKE THAT ROOM IT'S VERY OPEN ISN'T IT YEAH 
THERE IS A SMALL AREA OF GARDEN TO THE FRONT OF THE PROPERTY 
BUT AT THE BACK WHAT YOU SEE IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU GET 
APPARENTLY THE BUILDER CHOSE TO GO FOR A BIG HOUSE 
ON A SMALL PLOT RATHER THAN A SMALL HOUSE AND A BIG PLOT 
THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL BUT THAT IS THE ONLY DISAPPOINTING THING ABOUT IT THE GARDEN SPACE AT THE BACK 
SO UPSTAIRS IN THIS PROPERTY THERE ARE THE FOUR BEDROOMS I NEED FOR THE TOMKINS FAMILY 
A SORT OF BASIC LAYOUT OFF THIS LARGE SQUARE LANDING 
YOU'VE GOT TWO BEDROOMS AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND TWO AT THE BACK 
THIS IS NUMBER ONE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD SIZE DOUBLE 
IT HAS GOT FITTED WARDROBES SORRY ABOUT THAT PAULA 
IT'S A BIT SMALL FOR A DOUBLE ACTUALLY 
YEAH BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT WARDROBES FITTED WHICH I DON'T LIKE 
BUT USEFUL FOR CHILDREN JUST PUSH EVERYTHING OUT OF SIGHT 
LANDING WINDOW LOOKING OUT OVER THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
THEN IN HERE IS BEDROOM TWO 
THIS IS BEING USED AS AN OFFICE SO THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE CONVERTED 
BACK INTO A BEDROOM MAYBE FOR HOLLY ANNE 
SHE'LL SOON PUT A MARK ON THAT 
YEAH BECAUSE IT'S SMALLER THAN HER BEDROOM AT THE MINUTE 
A CABIN BED WOULD BE IDEAL WHICH IS WHAT WANTS ANYWAY 
NOW WE'RE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND THIS IS BEDROOM NUMBER THREE 
A GOOD THING ABOUT THE BEDROOMS IS THEY'RE ALL EVENLY SIZED 
SO THERE WON'T BE TOO MANY ARGUMENTS BETWEEN HOLLY ANNE LAURENCE AND MADDIE ABOUT WHO GETS WHICH 
IT'S ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THE FIRST ONE I THINK SO ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS LAURENCE'S 
NEXT DOOR IS THE FAMILY BATHROOM AND IT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZE 
IT'S QUITE WELL LOCATED BECAUSE IT'S HANDY FOR THESE THREE BEDROOMS 
THAT'S NICE SEPARATE SHOWER IS VERY USEFUL 
TUCKED AWAY ALONG HERE AND ON THE BACK OF THE HOUSE IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
SO PAUL AND PAULA WILL REALLY BENEFIT FROM THOSE A LOVELY VIEWS 
OUT OVER OPEN COUNTRYSIDE WHICH WAS ONE OF THEIR WISH LIST THINGS 
THAT'S A BETTER SIZE YES MORE SPACE THAT WAY ON 
BUT IT'S GOT ANOTHER REALLY BIG BONUS WHICH IS AN EN SUITE BATHROOM 
SO THIS WILL REALLY TRANSFORM FAMILY LIFE IN THE MORNINGS 
I'D JUST MAKE IT LIGHTER AND FRESHER 
I'D DEFINITELY CHANGE IT BUT I LIKE THE ROOM 
BROCK HOUSE IS A RECENTLY BUILT FOUR BEDROOM HOME 
ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
ALTHOUGH SPACIOUS INSIDE ITS ONE BIG DRAWBACK IS THE SMALL GARDEN 
I LIKE IT YOU LIKE IT TOO 
THE ONLY THING WAS THE GARDEN BUT I COULD PUT UP WITH THAT 
IF THE VIEWS COMPENSATE WE'D HAVE LESS GARDENING TIME 
AND MORE TIME EXPLORING THE COASTLINE WOULDN'T WE 
MY SEARCH HAS BROUGHT ME JUST SEVEN MILES FROM SHILLINGSTONE 
TO THE PICTURESQUE VILLAGE OF IWERNE MINSTER 
PROPERTY IS PRETTY PRICEY IN THIS VILLAGE 
THE AVERAGE HOUSE PRICE IS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND WHICH IS NEARLY AT THE TOP END OF THE TOMKINS' BUDGET 
HAPPILY I'VE MANAGED TO FIND A HOUSE WITH BAGS OF ROOM 
THERE IS JUST ONE COMPROMISE 
MY SECOND PROPERTY IS ONE OF THREE TERRACED COTTAGES BUILT IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN 
IT HAS FIVE BEDROOMS AND THREE RECEPTION ROOMS 
SO THERE'S HEAPS OF SPACE INSIDE BUT IT IS CLOSE TO A MAIN ROAD 
ALL THIS COULD BE THEIRS FOR THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THAT'S INTERESTING ISN'T IT 
I LIKE THE UPSTAIRS PART OF IT THE BALCONY DOES NOTHING FOR ME 
THE OWNER CAROLYN WILL SHOW ME AROUND 
HELLO I'VE IGNORED THE FRONT DOOR AND COME ROUND THE SIDE 
IS THIS THE DOOR YOU ALWAYS USE 
WE DO WE ALWAYS USE THIS DOOR 
WE'RE OFTEN COMING BACK WITH THE DOG OR INDEED IF YOU'VE COME IN THE CAR 
I LIKE IT I LIKE THE DOUBLE DOORS 
SO WE'RE COMING STRAIGHT INTO THE KITCHEN WHICH IS A LOVELY BIG ROOM EXACTLY WHAT PAULA IS LOOKING FOR 
IS THAT JUST AN EFFECT OR WAS THAT ORIGINALLY AN OUTSIDE WALL 
IT WAS YES 
THE HOUSE WAS EXTENDED SEVERAL YEARS AGO 
WELL THEY WERE CREATING A KITCHEN DINER BASICALLY 
THE UNITS ARE NICE YOU COULD EASILY CHANGE THE TILES 
A BIT SMALLER THAN THE LAST ONE 
DO YOU USE THIS AS A FAMILY AREA 
DEFINITELY IT'S VERY MUCH A FAMILY KITCHEN AND A FAMILY HOUSE 
SO IT'S GOOD PRACTICAL LIVING SPACE YES 
WHEN WAS THIS FITTED 
THIS WAS DONE ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO 
WE REDID THE KITCHEN 
LET'S CARRY ON THROUGH HERE 
I LIKE HOW THE COOKER'S SET APART THOUGH 
ORIGINAL QUARRY TILE FLOORS VERY COLD THINGS DROP VERY EASILY BOTTLES OF WINE ALL OVER THE FLOOR 
COME INTO THE LITTLE HALLWAY HERE WITH THE STAIRS IS THAT A KIND OF UTILITY SPACE 
YES I USE THAT FOR THE FREEZER FRIDGE AND TUMBLE DRYER 
THERE'S ANOTHER ROOM THROUGH THERE LET GO THIS WAY FIRST 
RIGHT SO THIS IS YOUR SITTING ROOM 
THIS IS THE MAIN SITTING ROOM THAT WE USE WHICH IS A LOVELY COSY ROOM WE'VE ALWAYS GOT A FIRE LIT 
IT'S A SMALL ROOM ISN'T IT IT IS 
QUITE A BIT SMALLER I'D FEEL CLAUSTROPHOBIC WE'D STRUGGLE TO FIT TWO SETTEES IN 
AND THEN WHAT'S NEXT DOOR 
THIS ROOM HAS BEEN USED FOR VARIOUS THINGS OVER THE YEARS BUT CURRENTLY IS A STUDY 
A STUDY BRILLIANT THIS IS ONE OF MY ESSENTIAL THINGS FOR PAUL BECAUSE HE WILL BE WORKING FROM HOME 
IT'S A SHAME YOU'VE GOT A FIREPLACE WHICH IS A FEATURE 
BUT IT WOULDN'T REALLY FIT IN WITH AN OFFICE NO 
GOING ON TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COTTAGE 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT IN HERE CAROLYN 
THAT'S A DOWNSTAIRS LOO RIGHT VERY HANDY 
NOW THIS WHAT AN UNUSUAL ROOM IS THIS AN ADD ON THIS IS PART OF THE EXTENSION 
AND THAT'S A DOOR TO THE GARDEN 
YES THAT'S THE BACK DOOR THAT GOES OUT 
AND ANOTHER DOOR ROUND HERE IT'S LIKE A WARREN ISN'T IT 
THAT'S A UTILITY ROOM WITH A SHOWER 
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF A SHOWER IN THE UTILITY ROOM 
AND WHAT IS THIS ROOM THROUGH HERE 
ANOTHER SITTING ROOM WE VERY MUCH USE THIS ROOM IN THE DAY ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER 
IT'S A NICE BRIGHT LIGHT ROOM 
THAT IS A NICE LITTLE ROOM A LITTLE SNUG 
I LIKE THE DUAL ASPECT TWO WINDOWS IS NICE 
THIS COTTAGE HAS HAD QUITE A FEW BITS ADDED ON TO IT OVER THE YEARS 
SO IT HAS GOT QUITE A HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY LAYOUT 
BUT UPSTAIRS THERE ARE FIVE BEDROOMS THIS IS THE FIRST 
IT WAS ONE OF CARRIE'S CHILDREN'S ROOMS 
IT WOULD MAKE A COMPACT DOUBLE BUT IT IS PERFECT AS A CHILDREN'S SINGLE 
IT MIGHT BE HARD TO GET THE BED IN WITH THE WARDROBE 
YEAH AND WHERE THE FIREPLACE AND CHIMNEY BREAST IS 
THAT'S JUST AN AIRING CUPBOARD IN THERE 
AND AROUND THE CORNER INTO A SURPRISINGLY BIG BEDROOM ACTUALLY 
IT'S REALLY LIGHT BECAUSE IT HAS WINDOWS ON TWO SIDES 
THERE'S A LOT OF SCOPE WITH THAT IT'S NICE AND BRIGHT 
YES IT'S A LOVELY SIZED ROOM 
ROUND THE CORNER WE COME TO THE NEXT BEDROOM BEDROOM NUMBER THREE 
IT IS A TINY SINGLE MAYBE A LITTLE MADDIE SIZED ROOM THAT ONE 
SHE'S RIGHT MADDIE SIZED DEFINITELY A MADDIE BEDROOM 
BIGGER THAN MADDIE'S BEDROOM NOW SO A BONUS FOR HER 
AND THEN NEXT DOOR TO IT IS WHAT IS TERMED AS A BEDROOM 
BUT THAT'S LAUGHABLE BECAUSE IT IS TINY IT'S BEING USED AS A DRESSING ROOM 
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A DRESSING ROOM 
ACROSS THE HALLWAY IS THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
FAIRLY DOMINATED BY THIS CORNER BATH 
BUT THERE'S MORE SPACE HERE AND IT HAS A SHOWER UNIT 
WHY DO PEOPLE GO FOR CORNER BATHS 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT MY CUP OF TEA 
DEEP CLAW FOOT BATH VICTORIAN LOOKING WOULD BE NICE 
AND THEN AT THE VERY FAR END OF THE COTTAGE OVERLOOKING THE GARDEN 
IS THE MASTER BEDROOM WHICH HAS GOT WHAT I CAN ONLY REALLY DESCRIBE AS 
AN OPEN PLAN EN SUITE BATHROOM 
YOU COULD PROBABLY PARTITION THAT OFF BUT AGAIN IT WOULD PROBABLY SPOIL THE ROOM AS IT IS 
THEN YOU'VE GOT WINDOWS ON TWO WALLS SO THERE'S LOADS OF LIGHT AND EVEN MORE LIGHT COMING IN 
THROUGH THE THESE FRENCH DOORS WHICH LEAD OUT ONTO A BALCONY 
CAROLYN TELLS ME THAT SHE AND HER HUSBAND SIT OUT ON THIS BALCONY AND HAVE BREAKFAST IN THE MORNINGS 
IT IS ALSO A GREAT PLACE TO SURVEY THE GARDEN 
IT'S A LOVELY IDEA HAVING THE BALCONY OFF THE BEDROOMS YES 
IT SORT OF WRAPS ITSELF ALL AROUND THE HOUSE 
LOVELY VIEWS THEY'VE GOT CHICKENS AND THE FARMYARD THAT IS NICE I LIKE THE ASPECT 
THERE ARE FULL PLANS IN PLACE TO BUILD A VERY SWANKY NEW GARAGE WITH STORAGE 
THEY HAVE LAID THE FOUNDATIONS SO NOT TOO MAJOR A JOB TO CARRY ON BUILDING IT 
THERE'S THE BALCONY SPACE HERE THERE'S A CONSERVATORY DOWNSTAIRS 
AND A PORCH THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE SO THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPTIONS 
FOR PAUL AND PAULA TO RECREATE THEIR BELOVED CONSERVATORY 
AND ALL OF THAT STILL LEAVES PLENTY OF SPACE FOR THE CHILDREN'S TRAMPOLINE 
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE SEEN IT AS THEY'VE GOT IT 
IF YOU HAD A BLANK CANVAS AND IT WAS UNDER BUDGET 
YOU COULD DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR MONEY AND GET IT HOW YOU WANT IT THERE'S SCOPE BUT YOU'RE LIMITED 
COMING UP ON ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRY I STRIKE GOLD 
I LIKE THAT ONE IT'S GOT THE WOW FACTOR 
I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY ONE 
AND PAULA FINDS THE ROOM OF HER DREAMS 
THIS IS LOVELY YEAH WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE SIZE BEAUTIFUL 
BUT FIRST I'VE GOT TO FIND MY NEXT PROPERTIES 
IT'S DAY TWO OF MY SEARCH AND I'VE SCORED A REAL COUP 
WITH NOT ONE BUT TWO PROPERTIES IN THE TOMKINS' FAVOURITE DORSET VILLAGE 
LYTCHETT MATRAVERS 
AND LOOKING ROUND I CAN SEE WHY THEY LOVE IT SO MUCH 
POOLE IS JUST SEVEN MILES THAT WAY AND THE VILLAGE ITSELF IS PACKED WITH THOSE ALL IMPORTANT AMENITIES 
BEST OF ALL THE PRIMARY SCHOOL IS JUST A TEN MINUTE WALK FROM MY NEXT PROPERTY 
AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND THIS SEMI DETACHED COTTAGE 
IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PROPERTY SO FAR 
IT HAS FOUR BEDROOMS AND A DOUBLE GARAGE 
A REAL BONUS AS IT IS PRETTY MUCH IN THE CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE 
THAT'S QUAINT ISN'T IT PRETTY ISN'T IT 
THE THATCH LOOKS IN GOOD CONDITION NICE AND NEW 
THE ONLY TROUBLE IS I'M NOT KEEN ON THATCHES 
SHEENA THE OWNER IS GOING TO SHOW ME AROUND 
I READ ON MY DETAILS THAT THIS IS AN AWARD WINNING DEVELOPMENT NO LESS 
WHEN WAS IT ACTUALLY BUILT THIS HOUSE WAS COMPLETED IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND TWO 
BUT THE DEVELOPMENT STARTED A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE THAT SO IT'S ALL IN THIS CENTURY 
YET IT LOOKS COMPLETELY IN KEEPING AND IT HAS BAGS OF CHARACTER 
IT'S THE SORT OF NEW DEVELOPMENT I WHOLEHEARTEDLY APPROVE OF AND APPLAUD ACTUALLY 
I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S AS MUCH CHARACTER INSIDE SHALL WE GET IN YES PLEASE DO 
A GOOD SPACIOUS HALLWAY 
EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCH SORT OF LIES OFF THIS HALLWAY DOES IT 
SHALL WE GO THROUGH THIS WAY FIRST 
GOOD SIZED SITTING ROOM NICE AND PRACTICAL FOR FAMILY LIFE 
IT'S A BIT DARK THERE'S LIGHT THERE BUT THE BRICK FIREPLACE DOMINATES DOESN'T IT YES TOO MUCH 
WHAT GIVES THIS PROPERTY SO MUCH CHARACTER IS THE THATCHED ROOF 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT MAINTENANCE 
HOW MUCH MAINTENANCE IS INVOLVED SHEENA 
THE RIDGE ON THE TOP OF THE ROOF NEEDS REPLACING EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS 
BUT THE MAIN ROOF ITSELF DOESN'T NEED REPLACING UNTIL IT'S THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY YEARS OLD 
ONGOING MAINTENANCE NEED TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH THAT WOULD COST 
LET'S CARRY ON ROUND THIS WAY SO THAT WE CAN FLOW THROUGH 
LOVELY BIG DOORS INTO THE ROOM IN THE MIDDLE HERE 
WHICH YOU ARE SORT OF USING AS A DINING ROOM 
I LIKE THE SIZE BUT IT'S A BIT OF A DUAL USE ROOM ISN'T IT 
THIS BRINGS US BACK TO THE HALL 
IT'S QUITE A NICE EASY LAYOUT ISN'T IT WHAT HAVE WE GOT IN HERE 
THE DOWNSTAIRS LOO RIGHT EXCELLENT 
AND SO INTO THE KITCHEN 
GOOD SIZED UTILITY ROOM WITH A DOOR TO THE GARDEN WHICH IS VERY GOOD 
NOW I LIKE THE KITCHEN THIS IS MY FAVOURITE ROOM IN THE HOUSE 
NOW I LIKE THE KITCHEN THIS IS MY FAVOURITE ROOM IN THE HOUSE 
THE KITCHEN'S ATTRACTIVE I LIKE THE UNITS 
IT'S BUILT ON THE CORNER NOTICE THE SHAPE OF THE UNITS LET'S SEE WHAT THE SEATING AREA'S LIKE 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR COOKING END UP HERE 
AND BAGS OF SPACE DOWN THERE FOR THE TABLE NOW I SEE WHY YOU DON'T NEED THAT LITTLE ROOM AS A DINING ROOM 
BECAUSE YOU'VE PLENTY OF SPACE IN HERE FOR SIX 
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU CATER ON 
I THINK PAULA'S GOING TO LOVE THAT SORT OF AN UPDATED RANGE 
THAT'S LOVELY THAT'S REALLY NICE NICE HAVING A BREAKFAST BAR I LIKE THE COOKER AS WELL 
WE HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING DOWNSTAIRS LIVING AND ACCOMMODATION WISE 
SO I'LL POP OUT AND LOOK AT THE GARDEN 
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL I COULD SEE ME IN THAT KITCHEN 
IT'S A LIVE IN KITCHEN ISN'T IT GOOD CHUNK OF MY DAY IN THE KITCHEN THAT IS LOVELY 
WHILST I WHOLEHEARTEDLY APPROVE OF THE DESIGN OF THE HOUSE 
I ADMIT THAT THE GARDEN IS A BIT OF A LET DOWN 
BUT THAT IS THE COMPROMISE OF BEING RIGHT IN THE HEART OF A VERY POPULAR VILLAGE 
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS A LARGE PART OF THE PATCH IS TAKEN UP BY THIS VERY SWANKY DOUBLE GARAGE 
AND THIS IS MY IDEA FOR PAUL'S HOME OFFICE APPARENTLY THE NEIGHBOURS HAVE ALREADY DONE IT 
IT ALREADY HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT SO IT JUST NEEDS CLADDING 
YOU COULD DIVIDE IT IN TWO ONE HALF AS A GARAGE AND ONE HALF AS A REALLY SPACIOUS OFFICE SPACE FOR PAUL 
AND GIVEN THAT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WORK TO BE DONE IN THE HOUSE 
IT WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD PROJECT FOR HIM 
A GOOD USE OF SPACE WE DON'T NEED A DOUBLE GARAGE THERE'D BE A LOT OF WORK TO CONVERT THAT 
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST OF THE CHARACTER OF THIS PROPERTY 
IS ON THE OUTSIDE WITH ITS CHOCOLATE BOXY LOOKS 
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE MADE SOME ATTEMPT ON THE INSIDE TO GIVE IT A BIT OF SORT OF PERIODY CHARACTER 
WITH THESE EXPOSED BEAMS HERE 
THIS IS THE FIRST OF THE FOUR BEDROOMS 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE FOR A CHILDREN'S ROOM 
COULD SQUEEZE A DOUBLE BED IN THERE 
NO FITTED FURNITURE WHICH IS A BONUS 
IT'S A GOOD SIZED ROOM IDEAL FOR THE CEILINGS LOOKS ON THE LOW SIDE AND SHAPED BECAUSE OF THE THATCH 
THAT'S THE AIRING CUPBOARD AND THEN NEXT DOOR IS BEDROOM NUMBER TWO 
THAT'S BIGGER ISN'T IT THAT'S LIKE A MASTER BEDROOM ISN'T IT 
NOW THE HOUSE IS ON A SLIGHT BEND SO THESE TWO BEDROOMS HAVE SLIGHTLY CURVY WALLS 
BUT IT IS WORTH POINTING OUT THAT THEY ARE STILL VERY PRACTICAL 
BECAUSE YOU COULD GET A PRETTY DECENT SIZED BED IN THERE AND STILL HAVE WARDROBE SPACE 
THAT'S INTERESTING ISN'T IT THE SHAPE OF THE ROOM VERY 
ONCE YOU FIT YOUR BED IN THERE YOU CAN GET THE FURNITURE WORK ROUND IT 
NEXT UP IS THE FAMILY BATHROOM WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE ROOMS 
IT'S WELL FITTED BUT I'M SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE SIZE IT'S QUITE SMALL 
IT'S A SHAME THERE ISN'T SPACE FOR ANOTHER WASH HAND BASIN THAT WOULD BE USEFUL 
WITH THREE CHILDREN IN THERE IT'S GOING TO BE A BIT BUSY 
BUT PRESSURE ON THE BATHROOM WILL BE MASSIVELY RELIEVED BY THE FACT THAT HERE IN THE MASTER BEDROOM 
THERE'S AN EN SUITE SHOWER ROOM SO PAUL AND PAULA HAVE GOT THEIR OWN BATHROOM SPACE 
THAT'S NICE THAT IS VERY NICE THAT IS FAR MORE SPACIOUS 
NICE DESIGN AS WELL 
IF THE TOMKINS ARE THINKING WELL IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIMITED ON SPACE 
THERE IS ONE FURTHER OPTION BECAUSE UP HERE IS THE ACCESS TO AN ENORMOUS LOFT SPACE 
THE NEIGHBOURS HAVE ALREADY DONE IT SO THE CHANCES ARE YOU'D GET PLANNING PERMISSION 
TO CREATE TWO ROOMS UP THERE WHICH WOULD REALLY TRANSFORM THIS HOUSE 
I KNOW IT'S NOT QUITE A CONSERVATORY BUT MAYBE PAUL WOULD LIKE TO BRANCH INTO THE LOFT CONVERSION BUSINESS 
DO YOU THINK I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE IT COS ITS THATCHED IT'S PRETTY IT IS BEAUTIFUL LOTS OF CHARACTER 
THE NEXT THING IS THE GARDEN YEAH I'M NOT KEEN ON IT FRONTING ONTO THE ROAD 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW BUSY THAT ROAD IS BUT IT'S A SHAME IT HASN'T GOT THE STUNNING OUTLOOK FRONT OR REAR 
IT HASN'T GOT EITHER HAS IT IT'S A SHAME BUT IT DOES LOOK PRETTY 
THIS FOUR YEAR OLD SEMI DETACHED COTTAGE COMES WITH FOUR BEDROOMS 
AND A DOUBLE GARAGE 
BUT THE THATCHED ROOF ALTHOUGH ATTRACTIVE WILL NEED MAINTENANCE 
IN THE YEARS TO COME 
DORSET UNDERWENT A PROPERTY BOOM JUST AFTER WORLD WAR TW O. 
SO IN MOST VILLAGES THERE ARE AS MANY MODERN PROPERTIES AS OLD AND LYTCHETT MATRAVERS IS NO EXCEPTION 
JUST OVER A MILE FROM HERE IS MY LAST PROPERTY 
IT WAS BUILT IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WHICH MIGHT NOT BE TO PAUL AND PAULA'S TASTE 
BUT IT DOES HAVE A RATHER SURPRISING ADDITION WHICH THEY MIGHT FIND HARD TO RESIST 
CAMARILLO IS A FOUR BEDROOMED DETACHED CHALET BUNGALOW 
THE ASKING PRICE IS JUST SHORT OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND WHICH IS NEAR THE TOP END OF THE TOMKINS' BUDGET 
IT LOOKS A BIT OLD PEOPLE ISH AT THE MINUTE WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE IT OUR STAMP I THINK 
IT'S GOT A LOT OF POTENTIAL HASN'T IT 
OWNER JO HAS LIVED HERE FOR TWELVE YEARS 
HELLO JO 
NICE TO SEE YOU NOW I HAVE IMMEDIATELY SPOTTED THE STAIRCASE WHICH IS A GIVEAWAY TO THE FACT 
THAT THIS IS A CHEAT'S BUNGALOW BECAUSE IT'S GOT AN UPSTAIRS 
THEN ONE ROOM HERE WHAT'S IN HERE THAT'S A DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM 
SO THAT'S SORT OF A LEFTOVER FROM WHEN IT WAS ALL ON ONE LEVEL 
SHALL WE GO THROUGH HERE NEXT 
THIS LOOKS LIKE YOUR SITTING ROOM VERY GOOD SIZE JO 
LOVELY PROPORTIONS 
AND THIS IS RATHER STUNNING 
WHAT'S THIS IT'S AN OPEN FIREPLACE WE BURN LOGS IN THERE 
SO THAT IS LIKE A LITTLE SCREEN YES 
THAT'S A NICE SIZE HAVE TO KNOCK THE CHIMNEY AND FIREPLACE OUT FOR A START 
IT IS A GOOD SIZED ROOM THOUGH IT IS 
O. K. LET'S CARRY ON WE ARE MOVING AWAY FROM THE ROADSIDE NOW ANYWAY 
AND GOING ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE KITCHEN THROUGH THERE 
LET'S GO THROUGH TO THIS END OF THE HOUSE FIRST 
RIGHT THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE USING AS A DINING ROOM 
YES IT WAS A BEDROOM WHEN WE CAME IN SO IT WAS FIVE BEDROOMS WHEN WE CAME 
AND HOW MUCH DO YOU ACTUALLY USE THIS NEARLY EVERY DAY 
NICE OUTLOOK THE ROOM LOOKS A BIT COLD AND CHARACTERLESS AT THE MINUTE DOESN'T IT 
BUT IT HAS A NICE OUTLOOK ON THE GARDEN LOOKS LIKE IT'S ON THE SIDE OF A HILL 
WHAT'S IN HERE THAT'S THE DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 
SO THIS IS SORT OF A LEFTOVER FROM WHEN ALL THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AS A BUNGALOW YES 
AND WHAT'S IN HERE AIRING CUPBOARD 
RIGHT INTO THE KITCHEN IS THIS PRETTY MUCH AS YOU FOUND IT 
NO WE PUT THE KITCHEN IN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO 
DON'T LIKE THE COLOURS THE SPACE IS HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY AS WELL ISN'T IT 
NOT AS OPEN AS THE OTHERS THERE'S NOT AS MUCH POTENTIAL IN THERE 
AND WHAT'S IN HERE THAT'S THE HIDEY HOLE 
GOODNESS GOOD WALK IN CUPBOARD WITH A WINDOW RATHER BIZARRELY 
SO THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL THE SUN ROOM THROUGH HERE 
ROUND THERE YES 
SO THE ENTIRE SIDE OF THE PROPERTY WAS EXTENDED 
I AM LOOKING FOR A HOUSE ON BEHALF OF A MAN WHO MAKES VERY LOVELY CONSERVATORIES 
HE MAY THINK THIS MAY BE THE IDEAL PLACE FOR HIM TO PUT ON ONE OF HIS REALLY SWANKY MODELS 
BUT DEFINITELY THE SPACE IS HERE 
IT'S A CORRIDOR WITH CHAIRS IN IT'S NOT A SUN ROOM NO 
THIS PROPERTY WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT AS A BUNGALOW 
AND THE OWNER BEFORE JO PUT THE UPSTAIRS LEVEL ON 
DON'T FORGET THERE'S ALREADY ONE BEDROOM DOWNSTAIRS 
THIS IS EFFECTIVELY BEDROOM TWO 
THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF ADDING THIS UPPER LEVEL 
IS THAT YOU ARE RAISED UP AND GET THE FULL BENEFIT 
OF THE OPEN COUNTRYSIDE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
I QUITE LIKE THE LIGHT AND THE SHAPE OF THE ROOM 
YOU COULD FIT THE BED IN QUITE EASILY YEAH 
NEXT DOOR IS THE BATHROOM THERE ARE TWO BATHROOMS HERE ONE DOWNSTAIRS AS WELL 
THIS IS BEDROOM THREE THE SMALLEST OF ALL THE BEDROOMS SO DEFINITELY ONE FOR THE CHILDREN 
YOU'D HAVE TO DRAW STRAWS AS TO WHO WAS GOING TO GET THIS ONE 
SMALL ISN'T IT IDEAL FOR MADDIE WE COULD PUT IN A CABIN BED 
AND GIVE YOU A BIT MORE SPACE OFF THE FLOOR WE DON'T WANT BIG BEDROOMS 
DOWN THE CORRIDOR WE HAVE ANOTHER AIRING CUPBOARD 
A UNIQUE FEATURE OF THIS PROPERTY IS THE MULTI LEVEL AIRING OPTIONS 
THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM IT'S GOT UNDER EAVES STORAGE WITH A MIRRORED EFFECT THIS TIME 
NOT SURE HOW PAULA WILL FEEL ABOUT THAT 
I DON'T LIKE THAT FITTED WARDROBES SLOPED CEILING 
BUT AGAIN WE'RE IN A SLOPED CEILING AND IT'S GOT MORE ROOM THAN OUR BEDROOM 
YOU COME OUT OF THE KITCHEN DOOR OR FROM THE DINING ROOM ONTO THIS LONG PATIO 
AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE TO ENJOY FANTASTIC VIEWS OVER OPEN COUNTRYSIDE 
THAT IS PRETTY THOUGH THAT GARDEN MAKES UP FOR THE PROPERTY DOESN'T IT 
IF I GO DOWN THESE LITTLE STEPS HERE 
THEY LEAD TO THE MAIN PART OF THE GARDEN 
AND I THINK THIS IS JUST THE KIND OF GARDEN MY FAMILY WERE HOPING FOR BAGS OF SPACE 
YOU HAVE GOT A PATIO AREA HERE THERE'S MORE UP ON THE TOP LEVEL WHICH SURROUNDS THE GARAGE 
AND THEN THIS HUGE PIECE OF LAWN SO THERE'S LOADS OF SPACE FOR THE THREE CHILDREN TO RUN AROUND 
THEY CAN HAVE THEIR TRAMPOLINE 
IT'S A LOVELY BIG SIZED GARDEN I DO LOVE THE GARDEN 
YES I THINK THAT IS THE PLUS POINT 
IT IS THE SELLING POINT OF THE PROPERTY ISN'T IT 
BUT THE REAL PIECE DE RESISTANCE IS TUCKED AWAY RIGHT AT THE END OF THE GARDENS 
SPECIFICALLY PLACED TO GET THE SUNSHINE 
TA D. A. IT'S GOT A SWIMMING POOL 
WOW THE KIDS WOULD LOVE THAT SOMETHING FOR THE CHILDREN 
IF IT WAS THEIR CHOICE THEY'D GO FOR IT WHAT A LOVELY OUTLOOK AS WELL THAT IS NICE 
NOW THAT PAUL AND PAULA HAVE SEEN MY PROPERTIES 
THEY MUST DECIDE WHICH TWO THEY WOULD LIKE TO VIEW 
BROCK HOUSE IS A NEWLY BUILT FOUR BEDROOM HOME 
GENEROUSLY PROPORTIONED INSIDE 
THE OUTSIDE SPACE IS SLIGHTLY SMALL 
IT'S VALUED AT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
PRESTON COTTAGE HAS FIVE BEDROOMS AND THREE RECEPTION ROOMS 
GREAT SCOPE FOR REDEVELOPMENT AND THE GARDEN IS A GREAT ASSET 
IT'S VALUED AT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
THIS SEMI DETACHED COTTAGE HAS FOUR BEDROOMS AND A DOUBLE GARAGE 
THE THATCH GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF AGE 
BUT THE PROPERTY IS ONLY FOUR YEARS OLD 
CAMARILLO IS A FOUR BEDROOMED DETACHED CHALET BUNGALOW 
IT COMES WITH A LARGE GARDEN PLUS THE ADDED BONUS OF A SWIMMING POOL 
BROCK HOUSE I LIKE THAT ONE IT'S GOT THE WOW FACTOR HASN'T IT 
I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY ONE TO HAVE A LOOK AT 
THAT ONE I'M STILL NOT SURE ABOUT YOU'RE NOT SURE COS OF THE AGE 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT IT I DON'T LIKE I'M NOT SO SURE ON THIS STYLE I THINK THERE'S POTENTIAL THERE 
TO PUT OUR STAMP ON AND MAYBE TO KNOCK SOME ROOMS DOWN INTO ONE 
I THINK IT NEEDS TO GO IN A MAYBE PILE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT 
ABBOTS MEADOW BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY LOT OF CHARACTER TOO SMALL 
WE HAVEN'T GOT THE SPACE THE GARAGE TAKES UP A LOT OF THE LAND 
I KNOW IT'S GOT POTENTIAL HEMMED IN AT THE FRONT AND THE BACK 
I THINK IT'S GOT TO BE A NO NO 
AND CAMARILLO THE LAND AND THE POOL AND THE VIEWS 
BEAUTIFUL BUT NOT THE PROPERTY 
THAT'S A DEFINITE NO NO IT'S A NO 
SO IT'S PRESTON COTTAGES THEN DO YOU THINK COME ON THEN 
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO HAVE A LOOK AND BROCK HOUSE YEP THAT'S IT DEFINITELY THEN 
HELLO NICE TO SEE YOU AND YOU HELLO PAUL 
START OF OUR BIG EXCITING DAY 
THIS IS PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
POP ONTO THE GARDEN 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT FROM THE OUTSIDE VERY PRETTY 
LOTS OF CHARACTER CAN'T WAIT TO SEE INSIDE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT AS WELL 
EXCELLENT LET'S HEAD IN WE'LL GO THROUGH THE KITCHEN DOOR FIRST 
FEELS NICE AND COSY NICE DINING SPACE 
NOT YOUR TRADITIONAL FRONT DOOR BUT I SEE WHY THEY'VE DONE IT IT'S CONVENIENCE 
COME AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE KITCHEN IS THIS THE SORT OF THING YOU HAD IN MIND 
IT'S DEFINITELY MORE SPACIOUS THAN MY OWN KITCHEN AND I DO LIKE THE DINING AREA OFF IT 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT NARROW THAT WAY 
I LOVE THE KITCHEN WINDOW ASPECT OVER THE GARDEN THAT'S PRETTY IT'S DECEPTIVE 
LOOKING AT IT ON THE COMPUTER IT LOOKS BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS 
THIS IS A BIT THAT WAS AN EXTENSION 
WHAT ABOUT THIS ROOM 
IT'S AIRY IT'S LIGHT IT'S NICE AND LIGHT 
THIS IS WHERE I THOUGHT YOU COULD COME IN WITH YOUR LOVELY PAUL DESIGNED CONSERVATORY 
YES I THINK THE PROBLEM AGAIN IS SEEING THE NEXT DOOR'S THROUGH THE PATTERNED GLASS 
I THINK IF ANYTHING WHETHER IT WANTS BREAKING UP COMPLETELY THERE 
CERTAINLY CHANGING THE ROOF NICE GLASS ROOF MODERN MATERIALS KEEP MORE HEAT IN 
SO WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THE CHANNELS THAT ARE THERE NOW 
SO COMING BACK INTO THE ORIGINAL HOUSE AGAIN 
SO MANY BITS HAVE BEEN ADDED 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ROOM I LIKE THIS ROOM 
IT'S A DOUBLE ASPECT ISN'T IT IT'S THE LIGHT THE VIEWS ONTO THE GARDEN ARE REALLY NICE 
LOOKING AT THE DETAILS OUTSIDE I THOUGHT A CONSERVATORY MIGHT SIT NICE OFF THIS SIDE 
BECAUSE THIS SIDE GETS THE SUN MORE AND TO WALK STRAIGHT ONTO THE GARDEN WOULD BE NICE 
BUT YOU CAN SEE THE LEVELS YOU'D LOSE QUITE A BIT OF GROUND TO DO THAT WOULDN'T YOU YES 
RIGHT SO WE'RE GOING BACK ACROSS 
ACROSS THE HALLWAY 
SO THAT WOULD BE YOUR OFFICE POTENTIALLY PAUL 
IT'S QUITE A GOOD SIZE 
IT'S A NICE SIZE THIS IS 
AND YOU'VE GOT A FIREPLACE IN THERE 
YES NICE FIREPLACE AS WELL THERE'S ALSO ONE NEXT DOOR THROUGH HERE 
THIS WOULD BE YOUR SITTING ROOM 
IT'S NICE AND WARM AND COSY DO YOU THINK YOU COULD IMAGINE YOURSELVES ALL COSIED IN HERE 
IT'S COSY IT'S A BIT SMALL FOR US IT'S SETTEES ISN'T IT YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY'VE TRIED TO GET SETTEES IN 
YOU'VE EITHER GOT TO GO FOR SMALLER FURNITURE OR LESS OF IT BECAUSE IT DOMINATES THE ROOM 
RIGHT I'LL LET YOU GO AND WANDER ROUND HAVE A LOOK UPSTAIRS 
LOOK AT THE GARDEN AND WE'LL GET TOGETHER LATER AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK O. K. BRILLIANT 
THIS IS THE MAIN BEDROOM THEN 
LOVELY AND LIGHT LOTS OF WINDOWS 
OH THAT'S INTERESTING THAT WILL HAVE TO GO 
WOW THIS IS LOVELY LOOK AT THE VIEWS 
WOW IT'S GORGEOUS I TELL YOU WHAT I CAN SEE MYSELF SITTING IN THE CORNER OF THIS 
WITH MY BANJO SLIPPERS ON AND A ROCKING CHAIR WHEN I'M SIXTY 
IT LOOKS NICE BUT DON'T GET TOO ATTACHED COS WE'D LOSE IT TO PUT A CONSERVATORY DOWNSTAIRS 
HELLO HI HERE YOU ARE SO HOW LONG IS THE LIST OF THINGS TO DO 
IT'S QUITE LONG THERE'S A LOT OF SCOPE FOR DOING LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS WITH IT 
THERE'S TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL WITH THIS PROPERTY 
YEAH YEAH FEELING QUITE POSITIVE ABOUT IT 
MORE POSITIVE THAN I WAS WHEN WE SAW IT ON THE COMPUTER DEFINITELY 
YES SHE'S GOT A LONG LIST OF THINGS TO DO 
IT'S QUITE EXCITING THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU COULD HAVE ACHIEVING YOUR DREAM HOME 
MAKING SOME CHANGES 
IT'S SOMETHING WE WERE LOOKING FOR WHEN WE FIRST LOOKED AT PROPERTIES 
YES SO THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE IT'S GOT THE POTENTIAL 
THE PROPERTY WE'RE GOING TO SEE NOW IS DIFFERENT SO LET'S HEAD OFF AND HAVE A LOOK AT THAT O. K. O. K. 
RIGHT SO HERE WE ARE PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
WHAT'S YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS VERY IMPRESSED 
I LIKE THE STYLE OF THIS ONE I DID FROM THE OUTSET 
RIGHT WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LET'S GET INSIDE 
RIGHT SO COME IN 
WOW LOVELY I LOVE THE SPINDLES AND THE STAIRWAY REALLY ATTRACTIVE 
IT'S ALL ON A CIRCULAR LAYOUT HERE SO WE'RE GOING ROUND THIS WAY 
THAT'S YOUR DOWNSTAIRS LOO VERY HANDY 
WOULD THIS BE BIG ENOUGH FOR YOUR OFFICE IDEAL 
PERFECT IT'S A PERFECT LITTLE SIZE ISN'T IT YES 
SO LET'S GO NEXT DOOR A SLIGHTLY GRANDER ROOM 
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THIS THIS IS LOVELY 
NICE DINING AREA IDEAL AND LOOK AT THE VIEWS LOVELY CUPBOARDS 
I REMEMBER YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT CHOPPING VEGETABLES IN A DARK ROOM MIGHT BE DANGEROUS 
WOULDN'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM HERE NO MASSIVE WINDOW 
WITH THE VIEWS AS WELL I'LL LET YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THE GARDEN IN A MOMENT O. K. 
LET'S CARRY ON LOOKING ROUND 
YOU'VE GOT A DINING ROOM IN HERE IT'S A NICE SIZE ISN'T IT 
A VERY NICE SIZE I LIKE IT BEING STRAIGHT OFF THE KITCHEN AS WELL 
THE DOUBLE DOORS ARE LOVELY ONTO THE LOUNGE 
AS YOU SAID PAULA IT FLOWS REALLY NICELY 
THROUGH INTO THE SITTING ROOM IT'S A VERY GOOD SIZE 
YES IT'S NICE LOVELY LIGHT AS WELL 
YEAH A BIT SMALLER THAN OURS MAYBE BUT I LIKE IT IT'S A NICE SIZE NICE AND LIGHT 
IT FEELS VERY COSY AND I LIKE THE FRENCH DOORS ONTO THE GARDEN AT THE BACK 
THIS IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROPOSITION FROM THE HOUSE WE JUST LOOKED AT 
BECAUSE THERE'S PRETTY WELL NOTHING TO DO HERE NO 
IN TERMS OF DIY OR JOBS IS THAT A GOOD THING 
ABSOLUTELY THAT'S VERY APPEALING 
IT'S APPEALING FROM ONE POINT OF VIEW BECAUSE MOVING TO A NEW AREA 
THERE'S LESS TO DO YOU CAN FAMILIARISE YOURSELF WITH PLACES AND THAT WOULD BE A BONUS 
BUT YOU'D PUT YOUR STAMP ON THINGS IN TIME THERE'S NO PRESSURE 
YOU CAN JUST DO IT AS AND WHEN AND THAT WOULD BE NICE 
I KNOW YOU'RE ITCHING TO GET OUTSIDE TO CHECK OUT THE GARDEN AND UPSTAIRS 
SO I'LL LET YOU WANDER ROUND ON YOUR OWN WE'LL GET TOGETHER LATER 
AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK LOVELY O. K. YES THANK YOU 
FAMILY BATHROOM NICE SHOWER SEPARATE SHOWER TO BATH 
YES WELL EQUIPPED ISN'T IT IT'S A DECENT SIZE COULD MAYBE PUT ANOTHER WASH HAND BASIN IN 
QUITE EASILY I DON'T LIKE THE TILES NO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THOSE 
TOO BRIGHT TOO LARGE NO NOT OUR TASTE ARE THEY NO 
I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE TILES AS WELL 
THEY'RE NO BETTER YEAH STILL BRIGHT IT'S A GOOD SIZED ROOM FOR AN EN SUITE ISN'T IT 
I LIKE THIS BEDROOM SIZE AS WELL 
IT'S A LOVELY SIZED BEDROOM 
I COULD PUT UP WITH THE FITTED WARDROBES IF I JUST CHANGED THE HANDLES 
YEAH BEAUTIFUL VIEWS YEAH IT'S NICE TO WAKE UP TO IN THE MORNING ISN'T IT 
YEAH NOT LOVING THE HEADBOARD THOUGH THAT WOULD HAVE TO GO AND THE DRESSING TABLE 
IT'S A PITY THE BACK GARDEN ISN'T BIGGER IT'S NOT AS BIG AS I THOUGHT IT WAS 
IT DID LOOK A BIT SMALL WHEN WE FIRST LOOKED AT IT BUT IT'S SMALLER THAN I'D LIKE 
WHAT ABOUT A CONSERVATORY THERE IT WOULD FIT WOULDN'T IT YES BUT IT WOULD TAKE UP A LOT OF GARDEN YEAH 
SO WE'VE SEEN BOTH THE HOUSES YOU CHOSE 
TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROPERTIES SO I'M AGOG TO KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY WHICH ONE YOU PREFERRED 
I FAVOUR THIS ONE AND FROM THE OUTSET I'VE LIKED THIS ONE 
BUT I KNOW PAULA PREFERS THE FIRST HOUSE WE LOOKED AT YEAH DIFFERENT REASONS REALLY ISN'T IT 
YOU'D LOVE THIS ONE BECAUSE THERE'S LESS TO DO AND IT'S A LOVELY LAYOUT 
BUT I LOVE THE SCOPE THAT THE FIRST ONE COULD POTENTIALLY OFFER 
I LIKE THE FIRST PROPERTY WE SAW THERE'S NO TWO WAYS ABOUT THAT 
BUT SUCH A LOT OF WORK NEEDS DOING 
AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU PREFER ONE AND YOU PREFER THE OTHER 
I THINK IT COULD SWING IT FOR ME IF I COULD GET A BIT MORE GARDEN WITH THIS ONE 
IF THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A BIT MORE LAND 
THAT WOULD MAYBE SWING IT MORE MY DIRECTION BECAUSE THE OTHER PROPERTY DID HAVE A LARGER GARDEN AREA 
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL PROGRESS ANY FURTHER WITH EITHER OF THE HOUSES AT THIS STAGE 
YES I'D LIKE TO PROGRESS FURTHER WITH THIS ONE 
WE NEED TO DO MORE INVESTIGATION DRIVE AROUND THE VILLAGES 
GET A BETTER FEEL FOR THE LOCAL AMENITIES THE SCHOOLS 
I KNOW THEY'RE BOTH GOOD BUT I THINK THIS ONE'S IN WALKING DISTANCE WHICH MIGHT HELP TO SWING IT AGAIN 
OVER THE COURSE OF OUR SEARCH TOGETHER HERE IN DORSET 
HAVE YOU LEARNED ANYTHING OR HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR VIEWS OF WHAT YOU WANT IN ANY WAY 
LYTCHETT MATRAVERS WE REALLY LOVED AND IT WAS LYTCHETT MATRAVERS WE'D HAVE LIKED TO HAVE LIVED 
BUT AFTER SEEING THE VILLAGES ROUND HERE 
WE REALISE WHAT BEAUTIFUL VILLAGES ARE OUTSIDE LYTCHETT MATRAVERS 
WE'RE LOOKING AT IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY NOW AREN'T WE TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
BEFORE WE WERE LOOKING AT IT THE AMENITIES SCHOOLS DOCTORS LIBRARY SHOPS 
NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT IT MORE COUNTRYSIDE NICER VIEWS IT'S THE PERIOD OF PROPERTIES HERE AS WELL 
WITH LYTCHETT MATRAVERS THERE WAS MORE NEWER PROPERTIES 
HERE YOU GET MORE PERIOD PROPERTIES WITH CHARACTER AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE BOTH REALLY LIKE 
IT'S VERY EXCITING AND I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK AND DON'T ARGUE ABOUT IT TOO MUCH WILL YOU 
WE'LL TRY NOT TO NO THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP YEAH IT'S A PLEASURE 
SINCE FILMING THE TOMKINS HAVE ADDED AN EXTRA BATHROOM TO THEIR HINCKLEY HOME 
IF THEY CAN SELL IN TIME THEY MIGHT PUT IN AN OFFER ON PRESTON COTTAGES 
SO HERE'S HOPING IT'S STILL ON THE MARKET
