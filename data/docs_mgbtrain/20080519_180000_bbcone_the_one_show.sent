HELLO WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW WITH 
CHRISTINE BLEAKLEY AND ADRIAN 
CHILES AND TWO ACTION MEN RAY 
MEARS IS HERE L. AM NOT SURE I HAVE 
SEEN YOU A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD 
BEFORE WE HAVE SOME URBAN BUSHES 
OUT THERE COULD YOU FORAGE ROUND 
IF THERE COULD YOU FIND ANYTHING 
FOR US TO EAT 
THERE MIGHT BE THE 
ODD THING 
SYRINGES THAT TYPE OF 
THING THE NO LESS MACHO DAN SNOW 
IS WITH US TOO HE IS A VERY 
SENSITIVE SOUL HE LIKES 
SHAKESPEARE YOU KNOW SPEAKING OF 
SHAKESPEARE CHRISTINE WHEREFORE ART 
THOU CHRISTINE WALKDEN COULD IT 
BE THE FLYING GARDENER HAS RIDDEN 
LIKE THE WIND HERE TO GET HERE FROM 
ESSEX YES SHE HAS WHAT A WOMAN 
SHE LOOKS THE PART THE CHELSEA 
FLOWER SHOW BEGINS TOMORROW I WAS 
DOWN THERE FOR A QUICK LOOK ROUND 
TODAY I WAS CHECKING THINGS 
OUT BEFORE THE QUEEN HAD A LITTLE 
LOOK ROUND THERE ENJOYING THE SHOW 
COVERAGE OF THE R. H. S. CHELSEA 
FLOWER SHOW FOLLOWS US ON B. B. C. ONE 
THIS EVENING A PASSION FOR 
GARDENING MEANS BRITISH GARDENS ARE 
IN GOOD NICK THAT IN TURN MEAN 
THERE'S IS MORE STUFF IN 
FOCUSED ON AROMATIC PLANTS AND THE 
WATER FUTURE THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO 
BE THE CENTREPIECE IT WAS WE HAD 
A BENCH WITH ROLL TOP A. M. S. SO SHE 
COULD SMELL THE PLANTS AND HEAR THE 
WATER 
AND ENJOY THE GARDEN SO WATER WHERE IS THE BENCH 
SOMEONE STOLE 
IT ABOUT SIX WEEKS' AGO WE GOT A 
ARES PLACEMENT ONE AND THAT WAS 
CHAINED DOWN BUT THEY DECIDED 
THEYED MAD HAD MORE THAN MORE 
NEED THAN WE DID 
IT MIGHT INDICATE 
IT WAS A SPECIAL GUARD FOREIGN A 
SPECIAL CHILD 
YES WE TOOK MEASURES 
THAT WE HOPE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE A 
CONSCIENCE AND THEY WOULD THINK 
BETTER 
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO BETTER NOW 
WE ARE THINKING RATHER THAN NOW BUTT SLASH PUTTING ANOTHER BENCH IN IS 
GETTING SOMETHING BUILT IN IT IT SEEMS A SHAME YOU HAVE TO GO TO 
THESE LENGTHS TO MAKE GARDEN FEEL 
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER SOPHIE 
IT IS 
BUT WHAT ELSE CAN I DO YOU KNOW WE 
NEED SOMETHING FOR SOPHIE AND I 
WANT SOMETHING THAT WILL STAY THERE 
I UP IS SUPPOSE SOMEONE SOMEWHERE 
IS SITTING ON THAT BENCH NOW I I HOPE THEY ARE NOT ENJOYING IT IF 
YOU THEY COULD SEE HOW LIMITED 
THE ABILITY SOME OF THESE CHILDREN 
ARE AND TAKE A BIT OF PLEASURE AWAY 
I THINK IT IS DISGUSTING 
BUT THE 
FIGHT BACK HAS BEGUN THIS CHESHIRE 
HOME HAS POSSIBLY THE BEST 
PROTECTED GARDEN IN BRITAIN IT HAS 
C. C. T. V. IT HAS MOVEMENT SENSORS YOU YOU ARE BEING MONITORED ON C. C. T. V. AND AND SOME OF THE PLANTS ARE LOCKED INTO 
THE GROUND USING SPECIAL ANCHORS 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THAT IS NOT 
GOING ANY WHERE THIS HIGH SECURITY 
GARDEN IS THE INVENTION OF ONE OF 
THE FEW FIRMS IN BRITAIN 
SPECIALISING IN PROTECTING YOUR 
BACKYARD 
WE ASK PEOPLE TO LOOK BACKYARD ROUND THEIR GARDEN AS IF THEY WERE 
A THIEF AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO 
BREAK IN AND STEAL SOMETHING AND 
HAVE A LOOK HAVE THEY GOT HOLES IN 
THE FENCE HAVE THEY GOT A GATE 
HANGING OFF THE HINGE A SHED WITH 
NO LOCK ON THE DOOR A LOT OF IT IS 
BASIC SIMPLE STUFF DON'T TAKE 
ANYTHING FOR GRANTED LOOK AFTER 
EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR GARDEN AND BE 
CRITICAL AND THINK LIKE A TOMMY TEA 
LEAF 
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT LEAF GARDEN FASHIONS HAVE CHANGED OUR 
TASTES HAVE GOT A LOT GRANDER LAST 
YEAR WE SPENT A RECORD FOUR BILLION 
IN THE PROCESS AS WELL AS PLANTS 
SHRUBS AND TREES WE HAVE BEEN 
SHELLING OUT ON ALL SORTS OF GARDEN 
ACCESSORIES WATER FEW FEATURE 
GARDEN FURNITURE AND STATUES TAKE 
A LOOK AT THIS AND ALL TO MAKE 
SURE THAT OUR LITTLE PIECES OF 
BRITAIN ARE THE ENVY OF OUR 
NEIGHBOURS BUT IT CAN ALSO MAKE 
THEM A HONEY POT FOR CRIMINALS AS 
THIS WOMAN KNOWS ONLY TOO WELL ON ON A FRIDAY RECENTLY WE HAD A LARGE 
DELIVERY OF PLANTS AFTER THEY 
DELIVERED THEM THE GARDEN DESIGNER 
SET THEM OUT SATURDAY MORNING 
WHEN WE GOT UP ONE OF THE PANELS 
WAS GONE AND THE PLANTS WERE SORT 
OF IN DIFFERENT STAGE MOVING 
ACROSS THE GARDEN 
THAT MEANS THEY 
PROBABLY HAD BEEN WATCHING YOUR 
GARDEN 
WE RECKON THAT SOMEBODY HAD GARDEN SEEN THE PLANTS BEING DELIVERED 
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU HAVE LOST IF 
THEY HAD TAKEN OFF THE PLANTS YOU 
HAD AT THAT TIME 
WE WOULD HAVE 
LOST QUITE A LOT 
QUITE A LOT HOW 
MUCH 
WELL SEVERAL THOUSAND 
IT IS MUCH EASY TO MAKE LIGHT OF SOMETHING 
LIKE THIS BUT WAS IT UPSETTING TO 
FIND IT 
IT IS IT IS MORE 
UPSETTING IF ONCE THE THIEVES ARE 
STRUCK YOUR INSURANCE WON'T GOVER 
COVER THE LOSS ONE EXPERTS 
ENCOURAGING THE GREEN FINGERED TO 
CHECK THEIR POLICY MOST PEOPLE 
HAVE COVER BUT THEY NEED TO GO 
ROUND THEIR GUARD AND AND ADD UP 
THE VALUE OF THEIR CONTENT AND WORK 
OUT WHAT IS IT WORTH AND COMPARE 
THAT WITH WHAT THEIR POLL GIVES 
THEN THEY WILL BE AMAZED TO FIND 
OUT THEY HAVEN'T GOT ADEQUATE 
INSURANCE SO IF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED 
ABOUT THEIR COVER WHAT CAN THEY 
DO 
THE FIRST THING WHEN THEY ARE DO LOOKING FOR A POLICY IS UNDERSTAND 
HOW MUCH COVER THEY NEED THE NEXT 
THING IS WHEN THEY ARE BUYING 
PRODUCTS DON'T GO FOR THE CHEAPEST 
CHECK THAT BIT IN THE POLICY WHICH 
SAYS HOW MUCH IT IS COVERED FOR AND 
MAKE SURE IT IS ADEQUATE IF IT IS 
NOT MOVE TO ANOTHER INSURER 
IF YOU 
ARE PUTTING THE FINAL FINISH 
FINISHING TOUCHES TO YOUR DREAM 
GARDEN YOU ARE READY TO ENJOY THE 
SUMMER TAKE MAKE SURE YOUR 
HORTICULTURAL HEAVEN IS SAFE FROM 
THIEVES BUT CHRISTINE MY GARDEN 
IS SOMEWHERE I WANT TO RELAX AND I 
DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE I AM IN A 
BIG BROTHER SET UP THAT JAMES BOND 
HAS KITTED OUT IT IS TERRIBLE 
ISN'T IT 
IT IS BUT THESE DAYS 
PEOPLE WILL NICK THING AND JUST 
SENSIBLE PRECAUTION GRAFUL PATHS 
HAVING LOCKS THAT WORK MAKING SURE 
THAT THE PLANT ISN'T ATTRACTIVE TO 
SOMEBODY THAT NICKS IT THE SPINIER 
AN NASTIER THE BETTER BECAUSE IT 
WILL RIP THE BLIGHTERS HANDS OFF SO 
THINGS LIKE U. K. KAS HAVE SPIKY AND 
THEY BITE LIKE MAD ROSES ARE GOOD 
PRICKLY PLANT SOME OF THE HOLLIES 
GOOSEBERRY REAL SPINEY FANNY 
NICKING THAT IN THE DARK FANCY

EVERY DAY THERE WEEK WE ARE 
CELEBRATING GREAT BRITISH EXPORT 
FIVE MEMBERS OF THE ONE SHOW FAMILY 
HAVE PICKED THEIR FAVOURITES L. 
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT DAN SNOW WOULD 
GO FOR SOMETHING LIKE A TANK OR JET 
FIGHTER BUT OH KNOW R. NO HE WANTS 
TO SHOW HIS DELICATE SENSITIVE SIDE 
THE GREAT BIG SOFTY HAS CHOSEN 
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE IN WRITING 
ABOUT EVERY LIFE EXPERIENCE 
IMAGINABLE SHAKESPEARE WAS NEVER 
SHORT FOR A FEW WORDS IN FACT HE 
HAS GIVEN THE REST OF US A FEW MORE 
TO PLAY WITH HE HAS HADED ROUND 
TWO THOUSAND WORDS TO OUR LANGUAGE AND YOU 
ARE QUOTING HIM EVERY TIME YOU SAY 
THINGS LIKE MORE FOOL YOU OR IT IS 
EARLY DAY I AM TALKING ABOUT THE 
WORLD'S GREATEST EVER PLAYWRIGHT 
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE AND HE WASN'T 
A BAD POET EITHER L. AM PAY AGO 
VISITS TO THE SHAKESPEARE BIR PLACE 
TRUST IN STRATFORD PAUL EDMONSON 
IS HEAD OF EDUCATION AND LEARNING 
HERE WHEN DID HIS WORKS START 
GETTING EXPORTED ABROAD 
HE WAS 
GROWING AS AN INTERNATIONAL WRITER 
DURING HIS LIFETIME LONDON WAS A 
COSMOPOLITAN PLACE PEOPLE ARE 
COMING IN FROM VENICE FROM THE NEW 
WORLD SHAKESPEARE IS RUBBING 
SHOULDERS WITH THESE PEOPLE I LIKE 
TO THINK THAT HE IS NOT JUST AN 
ENGLISH WRITER BUT A EUROPEAN 
WRITER 
WE FIND THE LANGUAGE WRITER DIFFICULT SO HOW CAN FOREIGNERS 
FIEP FIND IT ENGAGING 
HE BECOMES 
PART OF THE MODERN LANGUAGE OF THAT 
COUNTRY SO FOR EXAMPLE TO A GERMAN 
READER IN HIS OR HER OWN LANGUAGE 
THEY ARE READING A MODERN 
SHAKESPEARE SO THEY CAN THEIR 
PERCEPTION WOULD BE DIFFERENT TO 
OUR OWN 
DO THE VISITORS REFLECT 
HIS GLOBAL APPEAL 
THEY COME FROM 
ALL OVER THE WORLD L. LIKE TO THINK 
IF HIS D. N. A. IS ANY WHERE IT IS NEAR 
IN STRATFORD THAT IS WHAIBG MAKES 
STRATFORD SUCH AN INTERNATIONAL 
PLACE 
ROUND THREE QUARTERS OF A PLACE MILLION VISITORS PASS THROUGH HERE 
EVERY YEAR 
EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD 
PEOPLE WILL BE KNOWING SHAKESPEARE 
HE IS NUMBER ONE WOULD SAY BUT 
I AM ENGLISH 
ANOTHER POPULAR SPOP 
WITH TOURIST IS OF COURSE THE HEAD 
QUARTERS OF THE ROYAL SHAKESPEARE 
COMPANY I AM MEETING DEBORAH SHAW 
WHAT IS LIKE FOR YOU YOU ARE THE 
PERSON EXPORTS SHAKESPEARE AREN'T 
YOU 
WELL EXPORING AND IMPORTING YOU AS WELL BECAUSE SHAKESPEARE HAS 
BEEN OUT THERE HIS WORK HAS BEEN 
OUT THERE FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AND WE ARE 
IN DIALOGUE WITH ARTISTS FROM 
ABROAD COMING HERE AN THEN WE ALSO 
EVERY YEAR TAKE PRODUCTIONS OUT ALL 
OVER THE WORLD 
WHY DO FOREIGNERS 
HAVE THIS LOVE OF SHAKESPEARE 
THERE IS SO MANY WONDERFUL DRAM TI 
TISTS IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE THERE THERE IS NOBODY LIKE SHAKESPEARE HE 
COVERS THE WHOLE HUMAN CONDITION IN 
A WAY HE ARTICULATES THE HUMAN 
SPIRIT 
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THOSE SPIRIT PEOPLE WHO SAY HE ISN'T AS 
IMPORTANT AS EXPORT AS STEAM POWER 
OR THE TELEPHONE OR THE STAMP 
THERE IS LOT TO BE SAID FOR THE 
TELEPHONE BUT IT IS LIKE SAYING DO 
WE HAVE HOSPITALS OR CULTURE YOU 
WANT PEOPLE TO BE HEALTHY BUT YOU 
WANT THEM TO BE HEALTHY THIS IN 
SPIRIT IT SHOULD BE A SHAME IF WE 
WERE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BUT DIDN'T 
HAVE MUCH TO SAY 
SHAKESPEARE DIED 
IN STRATFORD ON AVON ON TWENTY THIRD APRIL 
ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTEEN THIS IS THE FINAL RESTING 
PLACE OF MY GREATEST BRITISH EXPORT 
HE DIED POPULAR SUCCESSFUL MAN BUT 
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED HIS 
WORKS ARE SO CELEBRATED CENTURIES 
LATER I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IN 
ONE THOUSAND YEARS TIME PEOPLE ARE STILL 
GOING TO BE READING SHAKESPEARE AND 
WATCHING HIM TRYING TO MAKE SENSE 
OF THEIR OWN LIVES AND THE WORLD 
ROUND THEM YOU SEE I CAN SEE YOU 
READING SHAKESPEARE IN THE OUTBACK 
I LIKE SHAKESPEARE DON'T READ 
NIT THE OUTBACK BUT I REALLY ENJOY 
IT 
IT IS INCREDIBLE EVERY DAY IT SAYINGS THAT COME DIRECTLY FROM 
SPAIBG SHEER SHAKESPEARE CRUEL 
TO BE KIND THOSE PHRASES WILL 
STICK WITH US FOREVER 
WHEN EVER WE 
ARE THINKING ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS 
LUST LOVE FEAR SHAKESPEARE GIVES 
US THE VOCABULARY TO DO THAT AND AND WHAT KIND OF FINANCIAL BENEFIT HAS 
THERE BEEN TO THE COUNTRY THROUGH 
SHAKESPEARE 
IT INTANGIBLE BUT SHAKESPEARE TOURISM WAS MASSIVE L. WENT TO THE 
COMPANY IT BRINGS A HUGE AMOUNT OF 
PEOPLE AND BUT IT IS MORE THAN 
THAT IT NOT JUST THE MONEY IT IS 
THE FACT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO 
COME PEOPLE WILL BE THINKING AND 
USING SHAKESPEARE TO MAKE SENSE OF 
THE WORLD AND IT BRINGS INTANGIBLE 
BENEFIT TO BRITAIN AND IT IS ONE OF 
THE REASONS ENGLISH IS THE WORLD 
LANGUAGE AND BRITISH INDUSTRY HAS 
DONE WELL 
IT'S A STRUGGLE 
SOMETIMES TO GET YOUR HEAD ROUND IT 
WHEN YOU FIRST READ IT TRANSLATING 
IT TO FRENCH OR GERMAN THEY CAN GET 
IT QUICKLY BECAUSE IT IS A MODERN 
VERSION 
IT MAKES YOU ABOUT THE VERSION YOUNGER GENERATIONS BOUNCING OFF IT 
WOULD YOU CARE I CAN DO BIT OF 
SHAKESPEARE IN CROATIAN IF YOU LIKE 
WOULD YOU CARE TO GUESS WHAT THIS 
IS 
I NEED MORE DRAMA PLEASE 
A BIT IS OF LIFE INTO IT 
IS THAT TO BE OR 
NOT TO BE 
GENIUS WELL DONE HE 
THOUGHT HE WOULD OUTSMART YOU THAT 
WAS IN CROATIAN BUT WE WE ARE 
INSPIRED BY THIS BOOK CALLED TO BE 
OR NOT TO BE INNIT WHICH IS 
SHAKESPEARE FOR THE MODERN 
GENERATION IT IS YOOF SPEAK YOOF 
SPEAK WE HAVE GOT A COUPLE OF 
DRAMA STUDENTS HERE WHO HAVE DONE A 
QUICK TWELVE SECONDS FOR US 
THERE WAS 
SOMETHING MINGING IN THE STATE OF 
DENMARK WHICH WAS MAKING UNCOOL 
TO BE OR NOT TO BE INIT WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE THE REST OF THAT THANK 
DO YOU PUPILS OF VALLE ACADEMY FOR 
THAT PERFORMANCE THANK YOU WE 
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK IS THE 
BEST BRITISH EXPORT IT MIGHT BE 
PERSON IT MIGHT BE AN OBJECT 
WHATEVER YOU THINK GO TO THE 
WEBSITE AND GOING BACK TO WHAT WE

YOUR FINELY SHAPED HEDGES WE WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE THOSE IF YOU CUT YOUR 
HEDGE IN THE SHAPE OF CHRISTINE WE 
WOULD LIKE TO THAT THAT COULD BE 
UNUSUAL GO OUT THERE TONIGHT 
EVERY TEN YEARS THE GOVERNMENT 
TAKES A CENSUS COUNTING HOW MANY 
PEOPLE THERE ARE OR TRIES TO IT IS 
PROBABLY EASIER THAN THE JOB ZOOS 
HAVE TO DO EVERY YEAR COUNTING 
EVERYTHING DOWN TO THE LAST INSECT 
OUR MAN HAS TAKEN HIS A. B. KUSTO 
BRISTOL TO LEND A HAND AM AT BRISTOL ZOO GARDENS FOR AN 
IMPORTANT JOB NO IT IS NOT WHAT 
YOU THINK I AM HEAR FOR ONE OF THE 
MOST IMPORTANT'S EVENT IN THE 
CALENDAR THE ANNUAL STOCKTAKE OF 
EVERY SINGLE ANIMAL ON THE PREMISES 
THE CENSUS STARTS WITH THE EASY JOB 
OF COUNTING THIS GORILLA AND HIS 
FAMILY 
FINISHED AND IT'S A REAL FAMILY PLEASURE TO COUNT THIS NEW BABY 
WHAT A GORGEOUS LITTLE BEAST 
MEANWHILE STAIR SPARE THOUGHT 
FOR WARREN IN THE BUG HOUSE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT ONE TWO 
WHAT A NIGHTMARE 
BUT I AM HERE 
TO HELP L. HAVE COME TO MEET MEL AT THE ZOO AND WE ARE 
GOING ON TO SQUIRREL MONKEY ISLAND 
AFTER YOU THANKS 
LOOK AT THEM THANKS WAITING BRILLIANT 
YOU CAN SEE 
THEY LOOK SIMILAR SO IT GETS HARD 
TO TELL THEM APART 
I WAS ABOUT TO 
SAY WHEN YOU DO THE CENSUS DOESN'T 
THAT LOOK LIKE THAT ONE HOW DO YOU 
SEX THEM AND NUMBER THEM 
WE HAVE 
WHAT IS CALLED A TRAN RESPONDER SO 
A MICROCHIP THAT GETS INSERTED 
UNDER THE SKILL SKIN THAT GOES 
INTO BRISTOL ZOO'S DATA BASE SO WE 
NEED TO CATCH THEM UP WHICH IS A 
BIT TRICKY 
A BIT TRICKY A 
LUMBERING THIRTEEN STONE IDIOT LIKE 
MYSELF RUNNING AFTER THESE LITTLE 
BEAUTIES THIS IS GOING TO BE MORE 
DIFFICULT THAN WE THOUGHT ISN'T IT 
THEY ARE SOAGELE THIS IS HOPELESS 
SO AGILE NOT EVERY ANIMAL IS 
MICROCHIPED AND HERE AS THE PENGUIN 
ENCLOSURE NIGEL IS COUNTING THEM BY 
A DIFFERENT METHOD AND ONE THAT HAS 
BEEN PIONEERED HERE AT THE ZOO SO 
WITH THE PENG PENGUINS IT IS 
ABOUT THE BANDS 
YES WE HAVE BEEN 
DEVELOPING THESE SILICON BANDS 
WHICH WE USE ON OUR PENGUINS NOW 
ORIGINALLY WE USED THESE VERY RIGID 
METAL BAND WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO 
SEE THE NUMBERS AND THEY WEAR ON 
THE FLIPPERS THE NUMBER IS UNIQUE 
TO EACH BIRD AND WE CAN LOOK AT 
THAT AND SAY THIS IS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR WITH WITH THESE NUMBERS NIGEL IS ABLE TO KEEP 
KEEP A STUD BOOK SEPARATING THE 
MEN FROM THE BOYS AND HE SHARES 
THIS INFORMATION WITH OTHER ZOO 
FOR BREEDING PURPOSES TO BE A 
CHAMPION STUD YOU NEED TO KEEP 
YOUR STRENGTH UP THAT IS WHERE I 
CAN HELP COME ON LADS HOORAY 
THERE WE GO HAVE SOME OF THAT IT 
IS O. K. IF YOU HAVE A FLIPPER BAND OR 
A MICROCHIP BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU 
ARE THIS SIZE AND THERE ARE 
THOUSANDS OF YOU HOW DO YOU COUNT 
THEM THEM INSIDE I AM GOING TO FIND OUT JUST 
LOOK AT ALL THESE LEAF CUTTER ANTS 
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COUNT THEM SO 
THIS IS NOT A JOKE HOW DO YOU 
COUNT THEM 
IT WOULD BE 
TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT IF WE HAD TO 
DO THE WHOLE COLONY SO WHAT WE DO 
IS CALL THE WHOLE THUNG ONE COLONY 
IT SEEMS LOGICAL BECAUSE THERE IS 
ONLY ONE QUEEN IN THERE SO THAT IS 
HOW WE DO IT 
HERE WE ARE IN YOUR 
OFFICE AND WE ARE COMPLETELY 
SURROUNDED BY SNAILS WHERE DO THEY 
COME FROM 
ALL OF THESE COME FROM 
FRENCH POLYNESIA AND WE NEED TO 
COUNT THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE 
TREMENDOUSLY RARE THEY ARE THESE 
ARE EX PING OH TINGE IN THE THE 
WILD THEY ONLY OCCUR ON THIS TABLE 
AND ANOTHER ONE IN FRANCE 
I HAVE 
TO SAY IT STRIKE MES AS FAIRLY EASY 
TO COUNT THEY DON'T DO A LOT OF 
MOVING 
WE NEED TO COUNT NOT ON THE MOVING NUMBER BUT WE NEED TO SPLIT THE 
COUNT INTO LIFE STAGE THE ONLY WAY 
YOU CAN TELL THE ADULT FROM A SUB 
ADULT IT HAS A LONG LIP THE LONG 
WINTER'VE NENS MUST FLY WE WAIT 
FOR THE SUMMER
