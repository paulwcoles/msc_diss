HE HAS HAD IT HE WANTS IT AND SO 
DOES HE TONIGHT THE THREE LEADING 
CONTENDERS TO BE MAYOR OF LONDON 
BATTLE IT OUT IN LIVE DEBATE 
GOOD EVENING UNLESS YOU LIVE IN 
LONDON YOU MAY WONDER WHY IT 
MATTERS WHO BECOMES MAYOR OF THE 
CAPITAL HERE IS WHY IT IS THE 
BIGGEST PRIZE IN LOCAL POLITICS 
WITH A BUDGET OF NINE BILLION IT IS 
THE MOST HIGH PROFILE POLITICAL 
CONTEST SO FAR THIS YEAR WHAT 
HAPPENS IN THE CAPITAL SENDS 
MESSAGES ACROSS THE LAND IT 
INVOLVES SOME OF THE MOST COLOURFUL 
FIGURES IN PUBLIC LIFE FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT LOSING WOULD BE A HUGE 
EMBARRASSMENT AND FOR THE TORIES 
HUNDREDS OF YOU HAVE WRITTEN IN 
WITH QUESTIONS YOU WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE ASKED WE SHALL NOT GET THROUGH 
ALL OF THEM BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE MADE OF ALL 
THREE FRONT RUNNERS WILL GET THE 
MINUTE AND A HALF BEFORE DEBATE 
BEGINS JUST BEFORE WE CAME ON AIR 
THEY DREW LOTS TO SEE IN WHICH 
ORDER THEY WOULD APPEAR THE MAN 
WHO DREW NUMBER ONE WAS BRIAN 
PADDICK PADDICK BRIAN PADDICK IS A FORMER DEPUTY 
ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF THE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE HE IS FIFTY IN A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS' TIME HE IS YET TO 
APPEAR ON A TELEVISION COMEDY SHOW 
WE ARE FACING ONE OF THE MOST 
SERIOUS CHALLENGES LONDON HAS EVER 
HAD TO FACE TWENTY SEVEN OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE 
WERE KILLED ON THE STREETS OF 
LONDON LAST YEAR ELEVEN MORE THIS YEAR 
PARENTS I TALKED TO SAY THEY ARE ON 
EDGE UNTIL THEY HEAR THE KEY IN THE 
DOOR WHEN THEIR TEENAGE CHILDREN 
ARE OUT IN THE EVENINGS WORRIED 
THAT THEY MAY NEVER COME BACK TO 
SAY THE MAYOR OR THE COMMISSIONER 
OF POLICE AND CANNOT DO ANYTHING 
ABOUT IT IS AN ABDICATION OF 
RESPONSIBILITY TO SAY THAT WE 
DON'T WANT POLITICALLY CORRECT 
POLICING AND YET SUGGEST THAT 
POLICE OFFICERS POLICE THIS ISSUE 
USING MAGIC ONCE RATHER THAN DOING 
STOP AND SEARCH I THINK IS 
INEFFECTIVE AND A CONTRADICTION IN 
TERMS WE NEED TO GET BACK TO A 
SITUATION WHERE THE MAJORITY OF 
LONDONERS BELIEVE THAT THE POLICE 
ARE ON THEIR SIDE AND WHEN MEMBERS 
OF THE PUBLIC ARE PREPARED TO TELL 
THE POLICE WHO WERE THE KNIFE AND 
GUN MEN ARE YES I WANT BETTER 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT L. DO NOT HAVE A 
CAR YES I KNOW WE NEED MORE 
AFFORDABLE RENTED ACCOMMODATION L. 
HAVE BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE THE 
INCREASE IN MY RENT HAS OUTSTRIPPED 
MY ANNUAL SALARY INCREASE MANY 
LABOUR SUPPORTERS ARE REALLY 
NERVOUS ABOUT RE ELECTING THE 
CURRENT MAYOR BECAUSE OF HIS 
CURRENT RECORD AND MANY TORY 
VOTERS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT 
ELECTING SOMEBODY WHO HAS NO TRACK 
RECORD AT ALL THERE IS A SERIOUS 
ALTERNATIVE SOMEBODY WITH A PROVEN 
TRACK RECORD AND THAT IS ME YOU YOU ARE THE LIB DEM CANDIDATE HOW LONG 
HAVE YOU BEEN A LIB DEM 
I JOINED 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS TEN YEARS AGO 
WHEN THE PRESS GOT A BIT TOO CLOSE 
TO MY PRIVATE LIFE L. LET THAT 
LAPSE AND I REJOINED ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT 
MONTHS AGO 
AND YOU ARE NOW THEIR 
OFFICIAL CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR YES YES THANK YOU COME OVER HERE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE HAS NOW SERVED TWO 
TERMS AS MAYOR AND HAS MADE SEVEN 
APPEARANCES ON HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR 
YOU HE IS SIXTY TWO 
LONDON EIGHT YEARS 
AGO WAS BEING TOLD THAT WE WOULD BE 
OVERTAKEN BY PARIS THE MEDIA EVEN 
THREATENED WE WOULD LOSE OUR 
POSITION TO FRANKFURT TODAY 
EVERYONE ACCEPTS WE HAVE CAUGHT UP 
AND PROBABLY OVERTAKEN NEW YORK 
THAT IS BECAUSE WE TOOK DIFFICULT 
DECISIONS AT THE RIGHT TIME AND GOT 
THEM RIGHT THE MAJOR PROBLEMS WE 
FACE AND WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO BE 
RUNNING TO STAY AHEAD OF THE 
COMPETITION NOT JUST NEW YORK AND 
TOKYO BUT NEW GREAT CITIES EMERGING 
IN SHANGHAI AND MUMBAI AND DUBAI 
ALL OF THESE REPRESENT A REAL 
CHALLENGE WE HAVE TO INVEST DID 
HE INVESTMENT IS IN OUR TRANSPORT 
SYSTEM THE PERSON YOU ELECT WILL 
SPEND THIRTY NINE BILLION INVESTING IN OUR 
TRANSPORT SYSTEM OVER THE NEXT TEN 
YEARS SIXTEEN BILLION OF THAT IN 
CROSSRAIL WE HAVE TO GET THESE 
DECISIONS RIGHT THE OTHER THING 
THAT IS CRUCIAL IS THAT WE HAVE TO 
GET THE ENVIRONMENT RIGHT THE 
BIGGEST THREAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE 
AND THEREFORE EVERYTHING WE DO HAS 
TO BE TO REDUCE CLIMATE EMISSIONS 
WHICH IS WHY I INTRODUCE NO APOLOGY 
FOR INTRODUCING A CHARGE FOR THE 
GAS GUZZLING SPORTS CARS WHICH HAVE 
NO PLACE IN A CONGESTED TOWN CENTRE 
WE HAVE BEEN REDUCING CRIME BY SIX PER CENT A 
YEAR BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT TEN THOUSAND 
UNIFORMED OFFICERS BACK ON THE 
STREETS AFTER THIRTY YEARS IN WHICH 
THEY WERE IN CARS THERE IS NOT 
ENOUGH TO PUT POLICE ON SAINT WE HAVE 
TO GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE SOMETHING 
EVERYWHERE PEOPLE SAY THERE IS 
NOTHING FOR KIDS TO DO THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS CHANGED THE LAW SO 
THAT AS OF THIS WEEK THE MAYOR HAS 
SEVENTY NINE MILLION TO INVEST IN YOUTH 
PROVISION AT EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS 
TO GET KIDS OUT OF GANGS AND OFF 
THE STREETS GIVE THEM ROLE MODELS 
AND MENTORS FINALLY YOU HAVE THE 
POSITION OF HOUSING ALSO THIS WEEK 
A NEW POWERS FOR THE MEHTA SPENT FOUR 
BILLION IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS 
ENOUGH TO BUILD THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES AT 
RENTS WE CAN AFFORD AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
HOMES WHERE A COUPLE ON A JOINT 
INCOME OF THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CAN GET THEIR 
FIRST FOOT ON THE PROPERTY LADDER 
YOU ARE OUT OF TIME I'M AFRAID 
WHEN YOU FIRST THOUGHT ABOUT TAKING 
THIS JOB YOU SAID YOU WOULD SERVE 
ONE TERM IS THERE ANY REASON WE 
SHOULD BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
THIS TIME 
I CHANGED MY MIND TWO 
THINGS HAPPENED WE SAW WHAT 
HAPPENED IN AMERICA CLINTON WOULD 
HAVE WON AND INSTEAD THE WORLD GOT 
GEORGE BUSH THE OTHER THING IS 
THAT I GAVE UP ALL OTHER POLITICAL 
AMBITIONS TO DO THIS JOB THIS IS 
THE LAST JOB I WILL DO IN PUBLIC 
LIFE SO I AM NOT BEHOLDEN TO ANYONE 
OUR THIRD CONTENDER BORIS JOHNSON 
HE IS CURRENTLY THE M. P. FOR HENLEY 
ON THAMES HE HAS ALSO HEADLIGHT ON 
HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU SEVEN TIMES 
HE IS FORTY THREE 
THIS ELECTION MATTERS 
BECAUSE IT IS THE CHANCE FOR 
LONDONERS TO VOTE ON THE ISSUES 
THAT REALLY MATTERED TO THEM THAT 
MEANS STOPPING THE STAGGERING WASTE 
AT CITY HALL AND THE SWANNING OFF 
TO VENEZUELA AND CONCENTRATING ON 
HOUSING AND TRANSPORT AND CRIME 
WHAT I WANT TO DO ONE HOUSING IS 
BUILT LOTS MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
ON BROWNFIELD SITES ACROSS LONDON 
BUT NOT TO KEEP EATING INTO 
LONDON'S GREEN SPACES BY DESTROYING 
THE GARDENS THAT WE HAVE LOST TWENTY TWO 
TIMES THE SIZE OF HYDE PARK IN THE 
LAST TEN YEARS L. WILL WRITE 
PRETENSION OF GARDEN SPACE INTO THE 
PLAN I WANT TO GET PEOPLE TO WORK 
ON TIME BY DOING A DEAL WITH THE 
UNIONS SO THAT THEY AGREE IN 
EXCHANGE FOR INDEPENDENT BINDING 
ARBITRATION NOT TO GO ON STRIKE IN 
THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE ABOUT PAY 
AND CONDITIONS L. L. WILL INAUGURATE 
AN ORBITAL ROUTE FOR BUSES IN SOUTH 
LONDON AND I WILL MAKE SURE OUR 
ABOVE ALL THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE ON 
THE BUSES IS SAFER AND MORE 
AGREEABLE BY GETTING ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED FORTY 
TRANSPORT P. ESSO'S ON THE BUSES 
AND I WILL MUCH MORE SYSTEMATICALLY 
TAKE AWAY THE RIGHT OF FREE TRAVEL 
FOR THE MINORITY OF TEENAGERS WHO 
ARE ABUSING AND I WILL ALLOW THEM 
TO EARN IT BACK ON A SCHEME L. WILL 
CONCENTRATE ON DRIVING OUT MINOR 
CRIME BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IS THE 
WAY TO DRIVE OUT MORE SERIOUS CRIME 
I THINK IT IS A DISGRACE THAT IN 
LONDON YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO BEEN 
BUT THEN YOU WERE IN NEW YORK TO 
BE MUGGED THAT IS WHY I WANT TO 
GET MORE POLICE ON THE BEAT AND WHY 
I BELIEVE THAT IT IS TIME FOR A 
MAYOR WHO WILL TAKE THE LEAD IN 
FIGHTING CRIME AND DISORDER THAT 
THE ROADS ARE THE QUALITIES OF 
PEOPLE'S LIVES AND RUNS DOWN 
NEIGHBOURHOODS AND THAT IS WHY I 
HOPE LONDONERS WILL VOTE FOR CHANGE 
AND FRESH THINKING FOR LONDON WHY WHY SHOULD WHAT YOU CALL PEOPLE WITH 
WATERMELON SMILES VOTE FOR YOU I I AM VERY PLEASED THAT I AM GETTING 
SUPPORT FROM ACROSS LONDON FROM ALL 
COMMUNITIES I HAVE NO DOUBT AT ALL 
THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE REFLECTED 
IN THE ELECTION AND MY 
ADMINISTRATION IN LONDON WILL 
REFLECT THE WONDERFUL DIVERSITY OF 
LONDON 
WHEN YOU WITHDRAW THOSE LONDON COMMENTS 
YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT I COMMENTS HAVE ALREADY APOLOGISED FOR THE 
DEFENCE THAT THOSE COMMENTS HAVE 
GIVEN THEY WERE TAKEN OUT OF 
CONTEXT BUT I KNOW THAT PEOPLE 
UNDERSTAND IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON 
FROM THE POLITICS OF DIVISION TO 
THE POLITICS OF UNITY 
LET'S TALK 
FIRST OF ALL ABOUT QUESTIONS OF 
INTEGRITY AND COMPETENCE BRIAN 
PADDICK YOUR LEADER NICK CLEGG 
HAS SAID THAT IF IDENTITY CARDS 
COME IN HE SAYS IT IS A LAW HE 
WOULD FEEL QUITE FREE TO IGNORE AND 
BREAK ANY YOU FEEL ENTITLED TO 
BREAK 
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME A BIT BREAK MORE TIME AFTER 
YEARS IN THE 
POLICE SERVICE IT WILL TAKE A BIT 
MORE PUSHING BEFORE I AM WILLING TO 
BREAK THE LAW 
BORIS JOHNSON APART 
FROM DRIVING ON A MOBILE PHONE I I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT I WILL NOT 
OBEY THE IDENTITY CARD L. HAVE GONE 
SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT I THINK IT 
TYRANNICAL AND I WILL GRIND IT UP 
AND EAT IT ON MY CORNFLAKES VERY VERY GENEROUS OF YOU ANY LAWS YOU WOULD 
BREAK KEN LIVINGSTONE 
I REALISED 
WHEN I CAME INTO PUBLIC LIFE THAT 
IF YOU BREAK THE LAW YOU PUT YOUR 
INVESTMENTS ELSEWHERE THE ONLY 
TIME I BROKE THE LAW WAS WHEN I 
MOVED HALF A DOZEN GREAT CRESTED 
NEWTS WITHOUT A LICENCE L. DID 
THINK OF WRITING TO THE POLICE TO 
TELL THEM BUT I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT 
THINK I WAS WASTING POLICE TIME 
WHO IS FUNDING YOUR CAMPAIGN KEN 
LIVINGSTONE 
THERE WILL BE A WHOLE LIVINGSTONE SERIES OF DONATIONS PRIMARILY BY 
EMERGING FROM THE TRADE UNIONS YOU YOU IMAGINE 
I DON'T WANT TO GET IMAGINE INVOLVED I DON'T WANT TO KNOW 
OTHER PUBLIC ENTITLED TO KNOW THEY THEY WILL BE PUBLISHED BECAUSE BORIS 
HAS DECIDED TO RAISE FUNDS DIRECTLY 
I THINK THAT 
IS A MISTAKE SOMEBODY SOMEBODY IS PAYING FOR IT WE ARE ENTITLED 
TO KNOW WHO 
NOT THAT MUCH HAS COME 
IN YET BUT THE REALITY IS HERE WE 
HAD A YEAR IN WHICH EVERY 
JOURNALIST AND ALL THE TORY PARTY 
RUBBISHED TONY BLAIR BECAUSE HE GOT 
INVOLVED IN FUND RAISING WITH BIG 
BUSINESS I DO NOT WANT TO GET 
INVOLVED IN FUND RAISING SUPPOSE 
THAT PERSON APPLIES FOR A CONTRACT 
IT COULD COME FROM ANYWHERE THEN 
IT COMES TO THE LABOUR PARTY ONE 
WOULD ASSUME THAT DUBIOUS ELEMENTS 
WOULD NOT GIVE MONEY TO LABOUR ON ON THE QUESTION OF COMPETENCE THE 
LONDON DEVELOPMENT INCORPORATION 
SEVEN ORGANISATIONS FUNDED BY THAT 
ARE CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED BY 
THE POLICE DOES THAT CONFIRM A 
REPUTATION FOR COMPETENCE 
OUT OF 
THE THOUSANDS THEY HAVE FUNDED OVER 
EIGHT YEARS WE HAVE FOUND SEVEN 
WHERE EITHER THE MONEY HAS BEEN 
MISAPPROPRIATED THEY WERE ALL 
BEING INVESTIGATED LONG BEFORE THE 
EVENING STANDARD GOT ON TO IT THE 
MOMENT THE ALLEGATIONS WERE 
RAISED AND ONE FIRM IN THE CITY 
CLOSES EVERY YEAR WE HAVE ASKED 
THE POLICE TO INVESTIGATE WE HAVE 
ASKED THEM TO INVESTIGATE TO SEE 
WHETHER ANY OF MY STAFF HAVE BEEN 
GUILTY OF MISCONDUCT IF THEY ARE 
THEY WILL BE PROSECUTED 
WAS INVOLVED 
BORIS JOHNSON NO ONE HAS ACCUSED 
YOU OF COMPETENCE 
I HAVE RUN 
EFFECTIVELY A PRIVATE SECTOR 
ORGANISATION AND UNLIKE EITHER 
OF THE MAN ON MY RIGHT L. HAVE 
EXPERIENCE OF HOLDING DOWN COSTS IN 
THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
YOU BOASTED 
THAT YOU MANAGE TO TWENTY PEOPLE 
A FEW 
MORE THAN THAT 
HOW MANY MORE AT AT LEAST FIFTY PEOPLE L. AM PROUD TO 
SAY YOUR VIEWERS WILL BE 
INTERESTED IN THE WAY THE LIBERAL 
CANDIDATE SCORNS ORGANISATIONS 
THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE 
ECONOMY AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE 
SUPPORTING I WILL STICK UP FOR 
THEM OUR RECORD WAS GOOD WE 
INCREASE THE CIRCULATION AND 
PROFITS 
I AM NOT SURPRISED GIVEN PROFITS THE STORIES THAT CAME UP 
YOU HAVE 
TO MANAGE THOUSANDS NOT JUST FIFTY 
IT IS ABOUT TIME TOO GIVEN THE 
RECORD OF MALADMINISTRATION AND 
WASTE AND NOW THEFT THAT HE HAS 
PRESIDED OVER IN HIS BUDGET IT IS 
UNBELIEVABLE WE TALK ABOUT 
COMPETENCE FROM THIS MESS MAY I 
FINISH THIS POINT KENNETH 
YOU CAN 
CALL ME KEN 
WON THE OLYMPIC BUDGET 
HAS TROUBLED ON YOUR WATCH WE ARE 
TOLD IT WILL GO UP TO TWENTY BILLION 
PRESIDED OVER THE METRONET FIASCO 
EXCUSE ME CAN I CORRECT SOMETHING 
LET'S GET ON TO POLICY 
I OPPOSED 
THE P. P. P. ON THE UNDERGROUND IT HAS 
COLLAPSED I HAVE RENEGOTIATED THE 
CONTRACTS AND REDUCE THEM BY FIVE HUNDRED 
MILLION WITHOUT WORSENING THE OFFER 
NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD HAS THERE 
BEEN A FIVE PER CENT A SHIFT FROM CARS TO 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT WE CARRIED FIFTY PER CENT 
MORE ON BUSES L. DO NOT MIND PEOPLE 
SAYING YOU CAN DO BETTER BUT DO NOT 
RUBBISH WHAT HAS BEEN A GOOD EIGHT 
YEARS 
WE WILL COME TO TRANSPORT IN YEARS A SECOND THE CONGESTION CHARGE 
WHEN YOU WERE INTRODUCING THIS AND 
YOU ORIGINALLY CAME IN AT FIVE AND 
SAID NO CIRCUMSTANCES WE WOULD BE 
INCREASED PALACE FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND THREE IN 
JULY TWO THOUSAND OF FRIDAY INCREASED IT 
IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT IF 
YOU GET BACK IT WILL BE INCREASED 
AGAIN FOR EVERYONE AND NOT JUST BIG 
CARS 
BUT WHEN I WENT INTO THE CARS ELECTION I GAVE A COMMITMENT I 
WOULD INCREASE IT L. AM NOW SAYING 
I WILL INCREASE IT TO TWENTY FIVE FOR GAS 
GUZZLING VEHICLES 
WIGAN ARE 
GUARANTEED FOR ORDINARY CARS IF IF I BREAK MY WORD AND INCREASE THE 
CONGESTION CHARGING FOR CARS BELOW 
THE POLLUTING LEVEL I WILL RESIGN 
YOU SAID YOU ALREADY BREAK YOUR 
PROMISE FIRST TIME ROUND 
IT IS A 
TWO YEAR GAP BETWEEN MAKING THE 
PROMISE AND DOING IT 
WHEN I SOUGHT 
RE ELECTION I SAID I WOULD 
INCREASE IT L. CHANGED MY MIND WE 
WERE GETTING THE STREETS CLOCKED UP 
AGAIN 
HOW DO VOTERS KNOW OF THE AGAIN PROMISES HE MADE TODAY WHEN YOU GET 
BACK IN OFFICE YOU WOULD CHANGE OF 
MIND AGAIN 
I GIVE AN ABSOLUTE 
COMMITMENT I DO NOT BREAK MY WORD 
IF I DID I WOULD STAND DOWN THE 
GUARANTEE IS ORDINARY CARS STAY AT 
EIGHT WE ONLY WON THE GAS GUZZLERS 
OFF THE STREET 
THAT IS THE SAME 
COMMITMENT YOU GAVE NOT TO RAISE 
CHEAP FARES THEY 
HAVE GONE UP YOU YOU HAVE THINGS TO ANSWER ON THE 
CONTEST IN CHARGE BORIS JOHNSON 
THE WESTERN EXTENSION CHARGE IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE WHOSE VOTES YOU 
WANT ARE YOU IN FAVOUR OF THE 
EXTENSION 
UNLIKE LABOUR I AM IN EXTENSION FAVOUR OF DEMOCRATIC CONSULTATION 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I DO NOT THINK 
IT IS A WORKING WELL THERE ARE 
BUSINESSES IN THE WESTERN EXTENSION 
OF SUFFERING AS A RESULT OF 
CONGESTION CHARGING L. AM PREPARED 
TO BE DEMOCRATIC 
ARE YOU IN FAVOUR 
OR NOT 
I DO NOT THINK IT IS 
WORKING I DO NOT LIKE IT THERE IS 
A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND THE 
LABOUR MAYOR HE PROMISED HE WOULD 
ACT UPON DEMOCRATIC CONSULTATION 
THE PEOPLE WERE CONSULTED AND 
DECIDED BY THREE TO ONE THEY DIDN'T 
WANTED HE THEN IMPOSED IT L. WILL 
CONSULT AGAIN ABOUT THE WEST 
EXTENSION THEN MAYBE PEOPLE IN THE 
WEST OF LONDON WHO HAVE CHANGED 
THEIR MINDS L. WILL ABIDE BY WHAT 
PEOPLE SAY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK TWO TWO THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE IN THE 
EXTENSION A ZONE SAID THEY DIDN'T 
WANT THE CHARGE THAT IS GOOD 
ENOUGH FOR ME L. WOULD ABOLISH IT 
IT IS NOT QUITE LIKE THAT YOU YOU EITHER CONSOLE PEOPLE AND JUNE 
LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAY IT OR YOU 
DO NOT 
WE CONSULTED PEOPLE CAN 
GET PETITIONS UP AND ORGANISE WE 
DO POLLING THERE WAS NEVER A 
MAJORITY FOR OR AGAINST L. HAVE 
NEVER INTRODUCED A POLICY WHERE THE 
OPINION POLL SHOWED THE MAJORITY 
AGAINST THE EXTENSION WAS 
SUPPORTED IN HIS OWN IT WAS CLOSER 
THERE WAS A MAJORITY AGAINST A A CONSIDERABLE MAJORITY AGAINST IT 
AND TO IMPOSE IT 
I WENT INTO THE 
ELECTION SAYING I WOULD EXTEND THE 
ZONE 
THERE IS ANOTHER POINT ON THE ZONE CONTEST IN CHARGE THE TWENTY FIVE POUND 
HIGHER RATE KEN LIVINGSTONE 
PROPOSED ON MORE POLLUTING VEHICLES 
ARE YOU IN FAVOUR 
NO BECAUSE HE 
HAS INTRODUCED A PACKAGE OF 
MEASURES NOT JUST TWENTY FIVE 
THE POINT 
IS MUCH OF YOUR PARTY IS IN FAVOUR 
HE HAS NOT JUST INTRODUCED TWENTY FIVE 
CHARGE ON HIRE CARS HE HAS 
EXEMPTED SMALL CARS THOUSANDS AND 
THOUSANDS OF SMALL CARS THE NET 
EFFECT WILL BE MORE POLLUTION AND 
MORE CONGESTION IN THE CENTRAL ZONE 
THERE WILL BE THE RESULT OF THE 
PACKAGE OF MEASURES 
I THINK THE 
PRIME'S ANALYSIS IS RIGHT IF YOU 
LOOK AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 
OF THE CHARGE HE IT IS 
NEGLIGIBLE YOU REDUCE EMISSIONS BY 
TWELVE THOUSAND PER YEAR IT IS 
ENVIRONMENTALLY TRIVIAL 
ON ANOTHER 
ASPECT OF TRANSPORT BENDY BUS IS 
YOU'RE GREAT INTRODUCTION WE KNOW 
THEY KILL MORE PEOPLE 
I AM SORRY 
THEY DO NOT NO ONE HAS BEEN 
KILLED 
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE KILLED FLEET ARE THEY 
THREE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT OUT OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED 
THEY WORK THE MOST DIFFICULT ROUTES 
BUT WHERE THEY HAVE KILLED SOMEONE 
HAS NOT BEEN BECAUSE THEY ARE LONG 
IT IS BECAUSE SOMEONE STEPPED UNDER 
THEM WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE 
PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY 
TO STEP UNDER A BENDY BUS THAN A 
DOUBLE DECKER BUS 
NO THEY ARE NOT 
IF YOU ON A BENDY BUS YOU ARE HALF 
AS LIKELY TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT THAT 
IF YOU ARE ON A BREW MASTER 
IT IS 
NOT JUST A DANGER TO BE PUT ON THE 
BUSES IT IS PEOPLE ARE ALSO THE 
BEST 
THE ROOTS MASTER 
THEY ARE BEST WELL KNOWN TO BE FREE BUS 
BECAUSE THE MAYOR OF LONDON CAN 
RELEASES AND I WILL STOP THIS 
HAEMORRHAGE A MILLION QUID FROM 
THE BENDY BUS AND JULIE'S FIFTY 
MILLION WE ARE GOING TO PHASE 
OUT THE BENDY BUS IT IS NOT 
SUITABLE FOR LONDON 
LET BRIAN 
PADDICK GET TO THE POINT 
WHY DID 
PETER HENDY SEND AN E. MAIL WHEN HE 
FOUND THE HEAD OF TRANSPORT FOR 
LONDON WHY DID HE SEND AN E. MAIL 
ARE THREATENING TO WITHDRAW FUNDING 
FOR THE POLICE WENT A POLICE 
TRAFFIC INVESTIGATORS SAID THE 
BENDY BUS WAS TO BLAME FOR FATAL 
ACCIDENT WHY 
THE BENDY BUS WAS 
NOT 
THE QUESTION IS WHY PETER NOT HENDY THREATENED TO WITHDRAW 
FUNDING FROM THE POLICE 
THE PERSON 
WHO FALL UNDER THE BUS WAS SEVERAL 
TIMES OVER THE LEGAL LIMIT FOR 
ALCOHOL AND HE FELL UNDER THE FRONT 
OF THE BUS HIS FRIEND HE WAS ALSO 
OVER THE LEGAL LIMIT WAS SO UNAWARE 
OF THIS L. AM AFRAID THE BLOOD 
TESTS SHOWED THIS PERSON WAS 
COMPLETELY MASSIVELY OVER THE LIMIT 
BORIS YOUR PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE 
WHERE TO GET THE IDEA YOU CAN 
DEVELOP REMASTER BUSES 
WHAT I WAS 
SAYING WAS IF YOU WANTED CONDUCTORS 
FOR THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SOUTHERN BINDI BUSES WHICH 
I SPOKE TO ABOUT VANESSA IT WOULD 
COST A MILLION QUID 
YOU WANT A NEW 
FLEET 
A NEW GENERATION OF BUS FLEET WHICH WOULD BE ESSENTIAL FOR LONDON 
YOU NEED TO SPEND TWENTY FIVE MILLION QUID 
TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR FLEET OF BUSES 
HOW MANY HOW MUCH NO I INVITE 
YOU TO SPECULATE TELL US HOW MUCH 
IT WOULD COST 
THEY WOULD COST NO 
MORE OR LESS THAN THE MAYOR'S OWNER 
COMMITMENT TO PRODUCE ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED 
HYBRID BUSES WHICH ARE GOING TO BE 
ON THE STREETS OF LONDON AND WHICH 
WILL BE BOUGHT NOT BY TRANSPORT FOR 
LONDON BUT BY THE BUS COMPANIES 
COME ON WHAT IS THE FIGURE THE THE AVERAGE COST OF A BENDY BUS IS A 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND I ENVISAGE THE COST OVER 
TIME BEING SUBSTANTIALLY BEARABLE 
UNDER THE BUDGET FUND 
HOW MUCH DO 
YOU PROPOSE TO SPEND ON THE NEW 
FLEET OF BUSES A FIGURE A FIGURE 
NO MORE THAN THE COST OF FIVE HUNDRED NEW 
HYBRID BUSES TELL US HOW MUCH ARE 
YOU PROPOSING ON THE BUSES 
IT HAS 
TO DESIGNED AND BUILT TO BE 
EXPENSIVE THEY 
WE ARE GETTING 
NOWHERE YOUR PROPOSAL IS NEW 
TRAMLINES 
IT IS 
NO YOU HAVE SAID TRAMLINES ENOUGH BRIAN PADDICK COME ON 
TRAMLINE 
THE ENVY OF TRAM TRACK TRAMLINE CROYDON WHO WON THE TRANSFER 
THROUGH WIMBLEDON AT THE MOMENT 
SAYS YOU 
A TRAM UP AND 
SAYS YOU CAN GET A TRAM UP AND RUNNING BETWEEN THREE OR FIVE YEARS 
AFTER PERMISSION IS GIVEN AND OVER 
A TEN YEAR PERIOD ON A BUSY ROUTES 
THEY ARE CHEAPER THAN RUNNING BUSES 
ALONG THE SAME ROUTE IF YOU POWER 
THEM FROM ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY 
ELECTRICITY SOURCES THEY CAN BE 
ZERO CARBON 
THEY ARE AN EXCELLENT 
IDEA WE AGREE ON HAVING AN 
EXTENSION BUT THEY DO COST FOUR OR 
FIVE SIX HUNDRED DEPENDING 
I WANT ONE 
WORD ANSWERS THE SALARY IT IS 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND IS THAT TOO MUCH TOO 
LITTLE OR ABOUT RIGHT 
IT IS ABOUT 
RIGHT 
IT IS RIGHT IT WAS EIGHTY THOUSAND RIGHT WHEN I FIRST STOOD 
IT SOUNDS HIGH 
TO ME 
WHAT SHOULD IT BE L. DO NOT 
I DO NOT NO IT IS SOUTH OF YOUR SALARY 
JEREMY 
LESS THAN YOU GET FOR YOUR JEREMY ARTICLES IN THE TELEGRAPH THE THE MAYOR SHOULD SHOW THE WAY AND MAKE 
A CONTRIBUTION TO THE FUND WHICH 
WOULD BE ADDITIONAL 
YOUR IDEA OF A 
SINGLE WORD IS INTERESTING IT IS 
TOO HIGH 
SHOULD THE REST OF 
BRITAIN PAY MORE TOWARDS THE COST 
OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
YES IT IS A 
NATIONAL EVENT NOT JUST THE LONDON 
EVENT 
I COMPLETELY AGREE WE SAID EVENT WE WOULD NOT INCREASE THE CHARGE 
FOR LONDONERS 
ABSOLUTELY I SEE NO 
REASON WHY LONDONERS SHOULD PAY A 
PENNY MORE IT IS TIME LONDON 
HOUSEHOLDS WHO HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR 
THIS SHOULD SEE SOME BENEFIT WE 
SHOULD DO A HARD DEAL AND GET 
DISCOUNTS FOR KIDS FROM LONDON 
HOUSEHOLDS 
WHOEVER IS NOW IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE HOUSEHOLDS WE HAVE SUBSIDISED TICKETS FOR POOR 
FAMILIES AND CHILDREN CANNABIS CANNABIS CLASS B. OR CLASSY RECLASSIFIED RECLASSIFIED AS 
MAKE THE LAWS ARE TOUGHER IT AS SHOULD BE CLASS B. 
I AM WORRIED 
ABOUT THE STRONGER CANNABIS L. DO 
NOT THINK IT IS ANY SENSE IN HAVING 
EXPERTS AND IGNORING THE ADVICE I I TOLD THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT 
COMMITTEE THREE MONTHS INTO THE 
CANNABIS EXPERIMENT THEY SHOULD 
LEAVE IT AT CLASS B. THIS MESSING 
AROUND WITH THE CLASS IS A RELEVANT 
TO YOUNG PEOPLE 
ONE WORD ANSWERS 
OF THE THREE CANDIDATES HERE 
TONIGHT IF YOU'RE NOT VOTING FOR 
YOURSELF HE WOULD YOU VOTE FOR I I COULD NOT POSSIBLY COMMENT OR ASK 
READERS TO CHOOSE 
IF I CANNOT VOTE 
GREEN MY CHOICE WOULD BE BRIAN 
PADDICK 
LONDONERS ARE BETWEEN IRAQ PADDICK AND A HARD PLACE AT THESE TWO 
CANDIDATES 
HAVE YOU A SECOND CANDIDATES PREFERENCE YOU CANNOT TELL THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US PEOPLE PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE FOR THE PERSON L. 
HAVE NOT MADE MY MIND UP YOU YOU CANNOT CHOOSE BETWEEN THESE TWO 
YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS YOU THINK 
THEY ARE EQUALLY BAD 
THEY ARE BAD 
IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
CRIME KEN 
LIVINGSTONE YOU HAVE SAID TONIGHT 
ABOUT THE DROP IN CRIME DURING YOUR 
TIME IN OFFICE AS BRIAN SAID TWENTY SEVEN 
TEENAGERS WERE MURDERED THIS YEAR 
ARGUE LIVING IN SOME SORT OF 
PARALLEL UNIVERSE 
THERE IS 
CONCERN FOR EVERY MURDER BUT WE HAD 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MURDERS FIVE YEARS AGO THIS 
YEAR IT IS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY A TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT REDUCTION 
THE HORROR IS THE INCREASE IN 
TEENAGE CRIME THE GOVERNMENT IS 
GIVING THE MAYOR MONEY TO DOUBLE 
YOUTH PROVISION MANY OF THESE KIDS 
COME FROM A DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES 
WE HAVE PUT LOTS OF POLICE ON THE 
STREETS AS TONY BLAIR SAID TOUGH 
ON THE CAUSES OF CRIME AS WELL AS 
CRIME 
THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED FORTY POLICE CRIME COMMUNITY SUPPORT OFFICERS AND FIFTY 
PEOPLE ON BUSES 
IT IS TIME FOR THE 
MAYOR TO GIVE THE NUMBER ONE MEET 
ON THE MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE CATS 
IN THE CAPITAL L. THINK THE PROBLEM 
ON BUSES IS SERIOUS FOR THOSE WHO 
GET ON BUSES ACROSS LONDON IF YOU 
DO DRIVE OUT MINOR CRIME YOU WILL 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE TWO MORE MAJOR 
CRIME WE SHOULD BE WORKING WITH 
THE KIDS WHO ARE MAKING THESE 
CATASTROPHIC CHOICES AND WRECKING 
THEIR LIVES AND THEIR LIVES OF THE 
COMMUNITIES THAT IS WHY IT IS TIME 
FOR THE MAYOR'S BANNED FOR LONDON 
WHICH IS A WAY TO GET THE WEALTH 
CREATING SECTOR IS TO FINANCE THE 
VOLUNTARY GROUPS ACROSS LONDON WHO 
ARE MAKING THESE CATASTROPHIC 
CHOICES AND CHANGING THEIR LIFE 
HOW MANY WILL THAT BE 
THERE WILL 
BE AT LEAST ANOTHER ONE THOUSAND GOING ON 
THERE WILL BE UNIFORMED POLICE ON 
THE BUSES THERE WILL BE TRANSPORT 
POLICE THERE WILL BE A 
SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER POLICE 
PRESENCE I HAVE WILL USE MY 
POSITION AS CHAIRMAN OF THE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE AUTHORITY TO 
WORK WITH THE COMMISSIONER TO GET 
SOME OF THE BUREAUCRACY THAT 
OPPRESSES THESE POLICE ON THEIR 
BACKS 
HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BACKS GOING TO DIE WHILE WE'RE WAITING 
FOR THESE INITIATIVES TO KICK IN 
NOBODY HERE IS SAYING HOW THEY ARE 
GOING TO GET BEAT GUNS AND KNIVES 
OFF THE STREETS BORIS JOHNSON IS 
TALKING ABOUT HAVING SCANNERS AT 
SCHOOLS AND AT UNDERGROUND STATIONS 
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD DO 
GET THE POLICE CONCENTRATING ON THE 
ISSUES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO 
LOCAL PEOPLE MORE AND MORE 
LONDONERS MUST BELIEVE THE POLICE 
ARE ON THEIR SIDE YOU CAN THEN 
RELY ON THE PUBLIC TO RING WHAT THE 
DEDE YEARS AGO WHICH IS PHONING UP 
AND TELLING THE POLICE HE LIT HIS 
WHO HAS BEGUN OR KNIFE THERE ARE 
HUNDREDS OF LAW ABIDING PEOPLE WHO 
NO FACILITIES BUT THEY DO NOT TRUST 
THE POLICE ENOUGH TO PHONE UP 
ANONYMOUSLY 
YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS ANONYMOUSLY AND YOU CARE ABOUT IT WE HAVE 
ALREADY HEARD WHAT KEN LIVINGSTONE 
HAS SAID ABOUT HIM HE WOULD VOTE 
FOR IF HE WERE NOT VOTING FOR 
HIMSELF OR HE COULD NOT VOTE FOR 
THE GREEN CANDIDATE FOR TO BE FIT 
IF HE OFFERED YOU A JOB RUNNING 
POLICE POLICY WHICH YOU TAKE IT 
NO I WOULD NOT L. HAVE TOLD THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS THAT WHEN I LEFT 
THE POLICE COME UP I WOULD ONLY 
TAKE ADVICE AND NOT TAKE ORDERS 
ANYMORE OF THE POLICE I WOULD 
ONLY TAKE ADVICE 
WE ARE OUT OF 
TIME EVEN FOR THE THREE OF YOU 
THERE ARE TEN CANDIDATES STANDING 
FOR LONDON MAYOR YOU CAN SEE THEIR 
DETAILS ON THE SCREEN NOW 
IF YOU MISSED ANY OF THE ARGUMENTS 
THE WHOLE DEBATE IS AVAILABLE TO 
WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN 
ONLINE BY GOING TO OUR WEBSITE 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME 
WILL SA DINGDING BE THE FIRST 
CHINESE POP STAR TO CONQUER THE 
BEST BEFORE THAT A ROUND UP OF 
TODAY'S NEWS HOUSE PRICES FELL BY 
TWO POINT FIVE PER CENT LAST MONTH ACCORDING TO THE 
HALIFAX IT IS THE FASTEST DECLINE 
SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES ON AVERAGE 
HOMES ARE WORTH MORE THAN THEY WERE 
A YEAR AGO BUT IT IS THE SLOWEST 
ANNUAL GROWTH RATE FOR FOUR YEARS 
THIS IS BEING BRANDED AS A TERRIBLE 
CATASTROPHE YEAR ON YEAR HOUSE 
PRICES ARE STILL UP 
THEY ARE YOU 
ALSO HAVE TO THINK OF PEOPLE WHO 
WOULD LIKE TO BUY HOUSES AND CANNOT 
AFFORD THEM AT THE MOMENT AS HOUSE 
PRICES GET CHEAPER AS OWNERSHIP 
BECOMES POSSIBLE FOR THEM 
DO YOU 
THINK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE 
MISUNDERSTOOD ABOUT MARKETS I I THINK PROBABLY THEY HAVE DURING 
THE BOOM PEOPLE WERE BORROWING 
MONEY ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT HOUSE 
PRICES WOULD ALWAYS GO UP AND MANY 
OF THE BANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES 
ASSUMED ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGES WERE SAFE 
BECAUSE HOUSE PRICES WOULD ALWAYS 
GO UP 
IN BROADER SOCIAL TERMS 
CLIVE IS IT DESIRABLE THAT HOUSE 
PRICES GO DOWN SOCIAL TERMS IS 
IT DESIRABLE 
THERE WILL BE SOME 
PEOPLE WHO WILL BE SERIOUSLY HURT 
THE POINT ABOUT HOUSE PRICE 
MOVEMENT IS THE TRANSFER RESOURCES 
FROM PEOPLE WHO OWN HOUSES TO 
PEOPLE WHO DO NOT ALL THE OTHER WAY 
ROUND WHEN HOUSE PRICES RISE 
PEOPLE WHO OWN HOUSES ARE MAKING 
MONEY AT THE EXPENSE OF IF YOU 
LIKE OUR DESCENDANTS PEOPLE WHO 
WANT TO BUY THEM IN THE FUTURE 
WHEN THEY FALL IT IS THE OTHER WAY 
ROUND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN OWNING 
HOUSES AND HAVE HAD A VERY GOOD RUN 
FOR THEIR MONEY OVER THE LAST TEN 
YEARS PROBABLY A REST AND A FORT 
IS A GOOD THING 
HOW FAR TO THINK 
THE FALL SHOULD GO 
I DO NOT THINK 
YOU COULD MAKE MORAL JUDGMENTS 
ABOUT HOUSE PRICES OR ANY OTHER 
SORT OF PRICE 
YOU CAN SURELY MAKE 
A JUDGEMENT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN PEOPLE'S AVERAGE EARNINGS 
AND THE COST OF FINDING SOMEWHERE 
TO GET A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD HOUSE HOUSE PRICES ARE ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT HIGHER THAN 
THE LONG RUN LEVEL FOR THE TWENTY PER CENT HAS 
BEEN A POPULAR NUMBER FOR QUITE 
SOME TIME L. WOULD NOT BE AMAZED IF 
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THEY FELL 
MORE THAN THAT THEY MAY STAY 
STATIC 
THANK YOU FOR SPARING THE STATIC TIME TO JOIN US THE MOTHER OF 
SHANNON MATTHEWS HAS BEEN CHARGED 
TONIGHT IN CONNECTION WITH THE 
ALLEGED ABDUCTION OF HER DAUGHTER 
KAREN MATTHEWS WILL APPEAR BEFORE 
MAGISTRATES TOMORROW CHARGED WITH 
PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE 
AND CHILD NEGLECT HER NINE YEAR 
OLD DAUGHTER WENT MISSING IN 
FEBRUARY FOR TWENTY FOUR DAYS SHE WAS FOUND 
IN A HOUSE NOT FAR FROM HER HOME 
AMERICA'S TOP GENERAL IN IRAQ HAS 
CALLED FOR SUSPENSION OF U. S. TROOPS 
IN JULY GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS 
SAID THE RECENT TRIP SURGE HAD BEEN 
SUCCESSFUL BUT THAT ANY REDUCTION 
COULD JEOPARDISE THOSE GAINS 
JUSTIN WEBB JOINS ME NOW FROM 
WASHINGTON WHAT TO THE SENATORS 
MAKE OF THIS EVIDENCE THE THE DEMOCRATS WERE PRETTY FRUSTRATED BY 
THE THRUST OF IT THEY SAID WHEN 
HE CAME TO US AND TOLD US THINGS 
WERE BAD AND WE NEED TO BE SAID TO 
MAKE THINGS BETTER THAT WAS ONE 
CASE NINE YOU MAKING THE OPPOSITE 
CASE THINGS HAVE GOT BETTER BUT WE 
STILL NEED THIS PAUSE IN THE TROOP 
NUMBERS IN IRAQ SO THAT THEY DO NOT 
BAOBAB DEGEN THERE IS A SENSE FROM 
CRITICS OF DAVID PETRAEUS OF WHERE 
DEBATE END IT WAS A SOMBRE HEARING 
I THINK IT IS BECAUSE EVERYONE IS 
REALISING THAT WHAT THE TRAIN AS IT 
DID NOT PROVIDE IS SOME KIND OF A 
FINALPOINT DAVID PETRAEUS THAT 
IS WHAT WAS MISSING 
WAS BARACK 
OBAMA GOING TO BE SPEAKING TONIGHT 
WE HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED BY MORE 
TRIVIAL MATTERS HERE 
HE DID AGAIN 
HE WAS AFFECTED I THINK BY THIS 
VERY SOMBRE ATMOSPHERE THERE WAS 
NOT A LOT OF POLITICAL TO AND FRO 
HE TOLD THE JOURNAL THAT HE 
BELIEVED THAT EIGHT TROOP 
WITHDRAWAL TIMETABLE SHOULD BE 
IMPOSED AND HE ALSO SAID THAT THE 
U. S. SHOULD BE TALKING TO A ROUND HE 
HAD A PERFECTLY AMICABLE 
CONVERSATION AS HILARY CLINTON HAD 
EARLIER AND JOHN MCCAIN TO SAME 
FOOT ON IT IS FASCINATING THAT 
DAVID PETRAEUS WAS APPEARING BEFORE 
THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES AS IT GETS CLOSER TO 
SOMEONE TAKING OVER THE JOB I 
THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THEY 
GET GENTLER WITH THE GENERAL IT IS 
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE FRIGHTENED OF 
HIM IT IS BECAUSE THEY GENUINELY 
DO NOT 
KNOW 
WHAT THEY 
WILL 
AND 
WHAT KIND 
OF JOB THEY WILL BE 
ASKING HIM OR HIS SUCCESSOR TO DO 
MOHAMMED AL FAYED HAS ANNOUNCED IT 
TONIGHT HE WILL ACCEPT THE VERDICT 
OF UNLAWFUL KILLING GIVEN AT THE 
INQUEST INTO THE DEATH OF PRINCESS 
DIANA AND HIS SON HE TOLD I. T. N. THAT 
HE DID SO WITH RESERVATIONS ENOUGH ENOUGH IS ENOUGH FOR THE SAKE OF THE TWO 
PRINCES WHO WILL FIND NO LOVE 
THEIR MOTHER AND HOW CLOSE THEY 
HAVE BEEN L. SAW THEM DURING THE 
HOLIDAY I'M SURE THEY HAVE 
APPRECIATED WHAT I HAVE DONE TO 
DISCOVER THE TRUTH L. HAVE DONE 
ENOUGH I AM LEAVING THE REST PAUL 
GODDARD TO GET MY REVENGE FOR 
GOT I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING ANYMORE 
IT'S F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX FINISHED 
DOWN AGAINST THE EURO THE POUND 
WAS DOWN AGAINST THE DOLLAR THE 
POUND WAS DOWN AS WELL AFTER A 
COUPLE OF DAYS IN WHICH IT SPARKED 
PROTESTS ON THE STREETS OF LONDON 
AND PARIS THE OLYMPIC TORCH IS 
LANGUISHING IN SECURITY SOMEWHERE 
IN SAFEKEEPING BEFORE IT IS 
PROGRESS THROUGH SAN FRANCISCO 
TOMORROW A BRIGHT NEW MUSICAL 
TALENT HAS JUST ARRIVED IN BRITAIN 
FROM CHINA ROBIN DENSELOW REPORTS 
SHE IS CHINESE SHE IS JUST TWENTY FOUR AND 
SHE IS CALLED SA DINGDING IN THE 
OLYMPICS HERE IN WHICH THE WESTERN 
MEDIA IS OBSESSED WITH ANYTHING 
CHINESE SHE COULD BECOME THE FIRST 
CHINESE POP STAR TO BECOME CELEBRITY IN THE WEST 
AFTER ALL SHE IS VERY CLEVER HER 
MOTHER IS FROM MONGOLIA AND SHE WAS 
BROUGHT UP AS A NOMAD ON THE 
MONGOLIAN STEPPES HIS LATER SA 
DINGDING STUDIED MUSIC IN BEIJING 
FORCED OF HER SONGS SHOW 
TRADITIONAL THEMES WITH WESTERN 
BEATS BEATS I REALLY HOPE I CAN 
INTRODUCE MORE THAN CHINA TO MY 
MUSIC FOR EXAMPLE MY MUSIC IS A 
MIXTURE OF MODERN AND ANCIENT 
CULTURE I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW HOW 
SOMEONE LIVING IN MODERN CHINA 
FEARS ABOUT AN HOUR ASIAN CULTURE 
FEELS ABOUT OUR ASIAN CULTURE 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR 
AUDIENCE IN CHINA 
I AM VERY GLAD THAT 
AFTER MY ALBUM WAS RELEASED IN 
CHINA LOT OF PEOPLE GAVE ME 
SUPPORT AND FEEDBACK DID NOT 
EXPECT THAT WHITE AUDIENCE WHICH 
CONSIST OF ANYONE FROM YOUNG 
CHILDREN TO MORE PEOPLE MIGHT 
AUDIENCE I FELT THAT THE END 
PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO THE MUSIC 
AND THE OLD PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED 
IN THE CULTURE BEHIND MUSIC SA SA DINGDING IS IN LONDON THIS WEEK FOR 
THE MUSIC AWARDS THE FACT SHE HAS 
FLOWN IN FROM BEIJING PERHAPS GIVE 
SOME INDICATION OF HOW SHE HAS DONE 
SHE WILL CERTAINLY BE PERFORMING 
HERE OVER THE SUMMER PROMISING A 
THEATRICAL SHOW INVOLVING ANYTHING 
FROM CHANTING MONKS TO KUNG FU SHE 
HAS ALREADY BEEN BOOKED FOR SOME OF 
THE BIG SUMMER FESTIVALS AND A 
CONCERT AT THE ALBERT HALL WHAT A 
HEAD CHANCES OF MAKING IT BIG IN 
THE WEST 
I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT SA 
DINGDING IS THE ONE TO MAKE IT HERE 
SHE IS UNIQUE IN THE WAY THAT SHE 
BLENDS THE ANCIENT AND MODERN AND 
ALSO USES MUSIC WE ARE FAMILIAR 
WITH THICK WITH THE MUSIC SHE HAS 
GROWN UP WITH THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND PLUS 
YEARS OF HISTORY IF SHE CANNOT 
MAKE IT THERE IS NOT A CHINESE 
ARTIST HE CAN 
SHE HAS CERTAINLY 
GOT BACKING IN LONDON'S CHINATOWN 
SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY AN EXECUTIVE 
FROM A MAJOR RECORD LABEL SHE IS 
SAID TO THE ORIGINAL SHE SINGS 
ANYTHING FROM ANCIENT SANSKRIT TO A 
LANGUAGE SHE INVENTED HERSELF AND 
STUDIES WESTERN POP AND THIS IS HIM 
BUDDHISM 
DIFFERENT RELIGIONS 
REVEAL DIFFERENT CULTURES BUDDHISM 
IS PART OF CHINA'S CULTURE 
INTERESTED IN LEARNING THAT 
DIFFERENT CULTURES AND RELIGIONS 
I AM INTERESTED AM MORE FAMILIAR 
WITH BUDDHISM AND NO MORE ABOUT IT 
IT GIVES ME A LOT OF INSPIRATION 
FOR MY MUSIC AND GIVES ME DIFFERENT 
WAYS TO UNDERSTAND IT 
THE IDEA OF 
LAUNCHING A CHINESE POP STAR IN THE 
YEAR OF THE OLYMPICS MUST HAVE 
SEEMED LIKE A RECORD COMPANY DREAM 
A VIDEO SHOT INTO BED AND ANOTHER 
WHICH ALSO INCLUDES THE SONG MAY 
SEEM LESS THAN A GOOD MARKETING 
PROSPECT SA DINGDING ARRIVED IN 
LONDON AFTER THE OLYMPIC TORCH HAS 
PASSED THROUGH THERE WERE ANGRY 
ATTEMPTS TO STOP IT BY PRO TIBET 
DEMONSTRATORS HOW DID SHE FEEL 
ABOUT THE PROTESTERS 
I KNOW THAT LOT 
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD LIKE TO GET 
VERY MUCH L. SUGGEST THAT IF YOU 
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TIBET YOU 
SHOULD GO THERE TO SEE HOW PEOPLE 
LIVE I HAVE BEEN THERE FOUR TIMES 
AND I HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS THERE 
PEOPLE WILL PEOPLE WERE 
COMMITTING CRIMES ANY RESPONSIBLE 
GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE CARE OF THE 
SITUATION AND PROTECT THE PEOPLE 
SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO 
ARGUE THAT CHINA IS OCCUPYING TIBET 
AND OUGHT TO GET OUT 
AS I HAVE SAID IF YOU 
WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING YOU SHOULD 
EXPERIENCE IT FOR YOURSELF THAT 
WILL HELP HIM MAKE THE RIGHT 
JUDGMENT I HAVE BEEN TO TIBET 
SEVERAL TIMES L. L. SUPPORT THE 
DECISION THAT GOVERNMENT HAS MADE 
SHE WANTS TO MAKE IT IN THE WEST 
BUT SA DINGDING CANNOT FORGET HER 
HOME MARKET OR HER HOME GOVERNMENT 
SHE HAS ALREADY SOLD TWO MILLION 
ALBUMS IN CHINA AND IS HOPING TO 
STAGE PRE OLYMPIC SHOW IN BEIJING TOMORROW MORNING'S FRONT PAGES 
PROPERTY PRICES COULD GO UP TEN PER CENT 
DOWN ECHOING THE FALL IN THE 
UNITED STATES APPARENTLY THERE 
SHOULD BE A CUT IN INTEREST RATES 
ACCORDING TO THE TIMES IN ORDER TO 
DEAL WITH THE PROPERTY PROBLEM 
BANKS ARE NOT PASSING ON EXISTING 
CUTS IN BANK RATES ACCORDING TO 
THE DAILY MAIL THERE HAVE ALREADY 
BEEN FOOD RIOTS IN EGYPT THEY WILL 
SPREAD ACCORDING TO THE UN 
SHANNON MATTHEWS'S MUM HAS BEEN 
CHARGED IN THE DAILY EXPRESS THEY 
HAVE COME BACK TO THE DISAPPEARANCE 
OF MADELEINE MCCANN'S THAT IS ALL 
FROM NEWSNIGHT TONIGHT WILL BE HERE AGAIN TOMORROW GOOD NIGHT
