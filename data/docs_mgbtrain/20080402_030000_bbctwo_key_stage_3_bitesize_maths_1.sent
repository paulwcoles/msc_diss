HELLO AND WELCOME TO KEY STAGE THREE BITESIZE MATHS REVISION 
THE SERIES DESIGNED TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR NATIONAL TESTS IN THE SUMMER 
IN THIS PROGRAMME WE'LL LOOK AT SOME OF THE IMPORTANT MATHS TOPICS 
YOU NEED TO REVISE ALONG WITH SAMPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO TRY 
JUST WORK THROUGH THE PROGRAMME IN BITESIZE CHUNKS 
AND CONCENTRATE ON THE AREAS YOU THINK YOU NEED MOST HELP WITH 
IN THIS PROGRAMME WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT 
FOR EXAMPLE THE DIGIT TWO CAN REPRESENT TWO UNITS 
TWO TENS OR TWENTY 
OR TWO HUNDREDS OR TWO THOUSANDS 
THE DIGIT REMAINS THE SAME BUT WHEN ITS POSITION CHANGES 
SO DOES ITS VALUE 
IF WE TAKE A THREE DIGIT NUMBER WE CAN PUT IT INTO COLUMNS 
UNITS TENS AND HUNDREDS 
IF IT'S A FOUR DIGIT NUMBER THERE WILL BE A THOUSANDS COLUMN AS WELL 
TAKE THE DIGITS ONE FIVE AND SIX 
FROM THIS WE CAN GET 
SO DEPENDING ON WHAT PLACE THE DIGITS ARE IN 
YOU GET A DIFFERENT NUMBER 
SO HOW DO DECIMALS WORK 
IF WE DIVIDE ONE WHOLE INTO TEN PARTS 
WE HAVE ONE DECIMAL PLACE 
THESE ARE ALSO TENTHS 
LOOK AT HOW WE COUNT FROM ZERO TO ONE 
OR 
NOW IF WE SPLIT EVERY TENTH INTO TEN PARTS 
THERE ARE TEN HUNDRETHS 
WE CAN WRITE ONE WHOLE AS 
HERE ARE COMMON USES OF DECIMALS 
DECIMALS ARE USED TO WRITE MONEY VALUES 
THIS MEASUREMENT IS IN METRES 
EIGHT TWENTY TWO M. MEANS EIGHT METRES TWENTY TWO CENTIMETRES 
LET'S LOOK AT HOW DECIMAL PLACES ARE USED 
TO COMPARE THREE JUMPS OF TOP CLASS ATHLETES 
IN A MEN'S LONG JUMP COMPETITION 
JAMES BEDFORD IN THE FIRST ROUND 
OH HE'S GONE OVER EIGHT METRES 
TREMENDOUS BOUNCE OFF THE TAKE OFF BOARD 
HIS THIRD ATTEMPT VERY POWERFUL 
HE HASN'T GOT THE SPEED OF THE OTHERS 
BUT IN TERMS OF SHEER AGGRESSION AND ATTACK HE'S VERY IMPRESSIVE 
THERE IT IS SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX 
JAMES BECKFORD LEADS AT THE MOMENT 
OH THAT'S BIG AS WELL 
STILL THE FIRST ROUND 
HIS HEAD STAYS ABSOLUTELY STILL 
THE BODY MOVES UNDERNEATH IT 
THAT'S A HITCH KICK TECHNIQUE 
WELL BALANCED AND AIMING FOR JAMES BECKFORD'S LEAD 
THE THREE ATHLETES HAVE JUMPED 
HERE ARE THEIR JUMPS ON A NUMBER LINE 
SEVEN POINT SIX SIX IS THE SHORTEST JUMP 
BECAUSE IT'S BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT 
THE OTHER JUMPS ARE BOTH BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE 
WHICH IS THE LONGEST 
EIGHT POINT OH FIVE IS ONLY JUST OVER EIGHT METRES 
IT IS EIGHT METRES AND FIVE CENTIMETRES 
REMEMBER THAT FIVE CENTIMETRES IS OH OH FIVE 
AND NOT OH FIVE METRES 
EIGHT POINT TWO TWO IS THE LONGEST 
BECAUSE IT IS EIGHT METRES AND TWENTY TWO C. M. 
NOW WATCH OUT FOR A REALLY COMMON MISTAKE 
EIGHT POINT NINE CAN ALSO BE WRITTEN AS EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY 
THE ZERO IN THE HUNDREDS COLUMN CAN BE WRITTEN IN OR LEFT OUT 
WHEN YOU COMPARE DECIMALS WORK FROM LEFT TO RIGHT 
COMPARE THE UNITS BEFORE THE TENTHS AND THE TENTHS BEFORE THE HUNDREDS 
YOU CAN MAKE THE SAME COMPARISON WITH MONEY 
EIGHT POINT NINE IN POUNDS WOULD BE EIGHT POUNDS NINETY 
EIGHT POINT FOUR FIVE WOULD BE EIGHT POUNDS FORTY FIVE PENCE 
WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE 
I'D GO FOR EIGHT POUNDS NINETY 
WHEN MAKING COMPARISONS MAKE SURE YOU'RE DEALING IN THE SAME UNIT 
AND KEEP AN EYE ON THE PLACE VALUE OF THE DECIMAL DIGITS 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS 
SHARING A ROOM WITH A SISTER CAN BE A NIGHTMARE 
ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE'S TEN YEARS YOUNGER THIS IS SINEAD'S PROBLEM 
I'M SINEAD I LIVE HERE WITH MY MUM MY STEPDAD MY BROTHER AND SISTER 
SINEAD HELLO I UNDERSTAND A FEW THINGS NEED SORTING OUT YES O. K. 
THIS IS THE ROOM 
WOW IT'S QUITE NICE INNIT YES SO WHY DO YOU WANT ME HERE 
YOU DON'T NEED ME HERE I SHARE THE ROOM WITH A THREE YEAR OLD 
MY SISTER AH RIGHT AND A LOT OF HER STUFF IS LEFT AROUND 
LIKE THAT CABINET I HATE IT 
SO THAT'S GOTTA GO COS IT'S OPEN 
SO IT'S BECAUSE YOUR SISTER SHARES THE ROOM WITH YOU 
YOU EACH NEED YOUR SPACE YES SO WE NEED TO DIVIDE THE ROOM UP 
YES BUT ALLOW YOU TO BOTH HAVE YOUR OWN SPACE I'M GOING INTO YEAR NINE 
SO I NEED A WORK AREA AH THAT'S ANNOYING WHAT COLOURS 
CREAMS AND THE COLOUR OF YOUR T. SHIRT O. K. AND WHAT KIND OF THEME 
CHINESE THEME RIGHT SO WE NEED WORK SPACE DIVIDE THE ROOM UP 
GIVE YOU YOUR OWN SPACE CREAMS BURGUNDIES AND CHINESE THEME YES 
LET'S GET ON WITH IT 
FIRST WE NEED TO FIND OUT HOW BIG THE ROOM IS BY MEASURING IT 
GIRLS 
THIS IS SINEAD'S MUM BERNIE YOU TAKE THIS ONE YOU TAKE THIS ONE 
MEASURE THE WINDOW THE DOOR I'LL MEASURE THE ALCOVE 
RIGHT I MAKE THAT ZERO SEVEN FIVE M. 
SINEAD NINETY FIVE C. M. NINETY FIVE C. M. 
BERNIE ONE M. SIXTY FIVE C. M. ONE M. SIXTY FIVE C. M. 
I WOULD GET IN A MESS IF I USED THEM FIGURES 
WE ALL USED DIFFERENT UNITS 
YOU NEED TO MAKE IT ALL CENTIMETRES OR ALL METRES 
LOOKING AT THIS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETRES EQUALS ONE METRE 
SINEAD WHAT WAS YOUR MEASUREMENT NINETY FIVE C. M. NINETY FIVE C. M. 
EQUALS ZERO NINE FIVE M. 
YOU HOLD THAT SINEAD BERNIE BERNIE MEASURED ONE M. 
SIXTY FIVE C. M. 
NOW ONE M. EQUALS ONE HUNDRED C. M. 
SO THAT'S ONE HUNDRED C. M. SIXTY FIVE C. M. 
EQUALS ONE SIXTY FIVE C. M. 
GIRLS OFF TO WORK 
I'M GOING TO WORK IN METRES TODAY 
SO I NEED TO CONVERT SINEAD AND BERNIE'S MEASUREMENTS INTO METRES 
CAN YOU BEAT ME TO IT 
ONE NINETY FIVE C. M. ONE NINETY FIVE C. M. 
IS ONE NINETY FIVE M. 
ONE M. EIGHTY FIVE C. M. ONE M. EIGHTY FIVE C. M. 
IS ONE EIGHTY FIVE M. 
THIRTY FIVE C. M. THIRTY FIVE C. M. 
IS ZERO THREE FIVE M. 
SO THE ORDER OF MEASUREMENTS STARTING FROM THE SMALLEST 
IS ZERO THREE FIVE M. ONE EIGHTY FIVE M. 
ONE NINETY FIVE M. 
WE'RE ALL MEASURED UP YOU'RE GOING TO PAINT I'M GOING TO MAKE A PLAN 
FINALLY LET'S LOOK AT NUMBERS TO THREE DECIMAL PLACES 
THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT PLACE VALUE WITHOUT THE HELP OF A NUMBER LINE 
LET'S LOOK AT OUR GRID WE'VE GOT AN EXTRA COLUMN HERE THE THOUSANDTHS 
STILL GOT THE UNITS DECIMAL POINT 
TENTHS HUNDREDTHS AND THOUSANDTHS 
WHEN WE'RE ORDERING OUR NUMBERS TO THREE DECIMAL PLACES 
THE METHOD IS STILL THE SAME 
SO LET'S TAKE OUR NUMBERS FIRST 
O. K. LET'S LOOK AT OUR FIRST COLUMN 
UNITS THEY'VE ALL GOT EIGHT UNITS IN THEM SO THAT DOESN'T HELP US 
LET'S MOVE IN TO THE NEXT COLUMN THE TENTHS COLUMN 
SIX TENTHS SIX TENTHS NINE TENTHS 
SO WHICH IS THE LARGEST NUMBER 
EIGHT POINT NINE OH SEVEN LET'S WRITE THAT DOWN AS OUR LARGEST NUMBER 
SO WE'VE GOT THAT ONE OUT OF THE WAY 
LET'S FIND THE NEXT LARGEST NUMBER 
UNITS ARE THE SAME LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT COLUMN 
TENTHS ARE THE SAME 
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT COLUMN THE HUNDREDTHS COLUMN 
FIVE HUNDREDTHS FIVE HUNDREDTHS STILL DOESN'T HELP 
LET'S GO INTO THE THOUSANDTHS COLUMN 
FOUR THOUSANDTHS SIX THOUSANDTHS 
WHICH IS MORE SIX OR FOUR 
SIX SO THAT'S OUR NEXT LARGEST NUMBER LET'S WRITE THAT DOWN 
WE'RE LEFT WITH ONE NUMBER 
EIGHT POINT SIX FIVE FOUR MUST BE THE SMALLEST NUMBER SO LET'S WRITE THAT DOWN 
WE'RE NOW GOING TO LOOK AT ROUNDING UP AND ROUNDING DOWN 
WE ROUND UP AND DOWN WHEN WE WANT TO APPROXIMATE 
THIS MAKES NUMBERS EASIER TO WORK WITH 
AND CAN BE USED IN ESTIMATING COMPLICATED CALCULATIONS 
WHEN WE'RE ROUNDING NUMBERS UP OR DOWN WE CAN USE A NUMBER LINE 
I'VE GOT A NUMBER LINE HERE WITH THE NUMBERS SEVENTY NINE EIGHTY AND EIGHTY ONE ON IT 
THIS IS THE NUMBER 
THAT I WANT TO ROUND UP OR DOWN TO ONE DECIMAL PLACE 
LET'S SEE WHERE IT MIGHT FIT ON OUR NUMBER LINE 
WE KNOW THAT SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FOUR IS MORE THAN SEVENTY NINE 
BECAUSE IT'S GOT FOUR HUNDREDTHS AS WELL 
BUT WE KNOW IT'S SMALLER THAN EIGHTY 
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY GOT SEVEN UNITS 
SO IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE HERE 
LET'S DIVIDE THIS NUMBER LINE UP MORE 
LET'S TAKE THE MIDPOINT HERE 
AND SAY THAT THIS IS SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
WHERE DO YOU THINK SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FOUR IS CLOSEST TO 
IS IT ON THIS SIDE OF SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
OR THIS SIDE OF SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
WE KNOW THAT IT WOULD FIT HERE 
SO IF WE WANT TO ROUND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FOUR TO ONE DECIMAL PLACE 
WE WOULD ROUND IT DOWN TO SEVENTY NINE 
WHILE WE'RE USING NUMBER LINES THINK ABOUT THIS ONE 
A MISTAKE MADE OFTEN IS TO THINK THAT BECAUSE NINE ONE EQUALS TEN 
ZERO POINT NINE PLUS OH ONE IS OH ONE OH AND THAT'S WRONG 
TO MAKE SURE YOU NEVER MAKE THAT MISTAKE LOOK AT THE NUMBER LINE 
ADDING OH ONE TO SEVENTY NINE WOULD MOVE IT ALONG THE NUMBER LINE TO THE RIGHT 
GIVING US EIGHTY 
SEVEN POINT TEN ON THE OTHER HAND OR SEVEN POINT ONE ZERO 
IS ACTUALLY JUST THE SAME AS SEVENTY ONE 
NOW ON TO ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF NUMBERS TO TWO DECIMAL PLACES 
IT'S JUST THE SAME AS ANY ADDITION SUM 
BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER TO KEEP THE DECIMAL POINTS IN THE SAME PLACE 
THEY MUST NOT MOVE 
LET'S START WITH THIS COLUMN FIRST 
ZERO FIVE EQUALS FIVE 
THREE TWO EQUALS FIVE 
THE DECIMAL POINT IN EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE 
FIVE SIX EQUALS ELEVEN 
LET'S MOVE ON TO SUBTRACTION 
REMEMBER THAT ALL OUR DECIMAL POINTS ARE IN THE SAME PLACE 
SO WE'LL DO THIS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SUBTRACTION LET'S START HERE 
FIVE ZERO EQUALS FIVE 
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TWO THREE SO WHAT DO WE DO 
WE BORROW A UNIT FROM THIS SIDE 
SO WE TAKE ONE FROM THE SIX OVER TO HERE 
BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN ONE AWAY WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT 
AND WRITE A FIVE UP THERE 
LET'S DO THE REST OF THE SUM 
TWELVE THREE EQUALS NINE 
DECIMAL POINT IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
FIVE FIVE 
SO THE ANSWER IS 
FINALLY LET'S CHECK MULTIPLYING AND DIVIDING DECIMALS BY WHOLE NUMBERS 
WE'VE GOT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTEEN MULTIPLIED BY SEVEN 
WE DO IT LIKE ANY OTHER MULTIPLICATION SUM 
BUT REMEMBER TO KEEP THE DECIMAL POINT IN THE SAME PLACE 
THAT WOULD FOLLOW TO HERE 
I DO IT LIKE ANY OTHER MULTIPLICATION 
STARTING FROM THIS END 
THREE X. SEVEN 
CARRY THE TWO 
ONE X. SEVEN EQUALS SEVEN ADD THE TWO 
DECIMAL POINT IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
THEN FOUR X. SEVEN 
SO FOUR HUNDRED THIRTEEN MULTIPLIED BY SEVEN GIVES YOU AN ANSWER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE 
LET'S MOVE ON TO DIVISION 
FIRST WE PUT THE DECIMAL POINT IN 
SEVEN INTO TWO DOESN'T GO SO WE CARRY IT 
SEVEN INTO TWENTY FOUR GOES THREE TIMES 
WITH A REMAINDER OF THREE WHICH WE CARRY OVER AGAIN 
NOW WE DO SEVEN INTO THIRTY FIVE 
THAT GOES NEATLY FIVE TIMES 
FINALLY SEVEN INTO SEVEN GOES ONCE 
SO TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN DIVIDED BY SEVEN IS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE 
PART A SAYS 
PART B. SAYS 
AND C. 
AND PART D. 
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO STOP THE TAPE AND TRY 
TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS YOURSELF 
THIS ONE HAS TO BE DONE WITHOUT A CALCULATOR 
DON'T FORGET TO SHOW HOW YOU WORKED OUT YOUR ANSWER 
LET'S WORK THROUGH THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS ONE AT A TIME 
PART A IF ONE BLANK D. V. D. COSTS TWO POINT FIVE OH THE COST OF SIXTEEN D. V. D. S. 
MUST BE TWO POINT FIVE OH MULTIPLIED BY SIXTEEN 
THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS TO MULTIPLY BY SIXTEEN HERE'S ONE 
IF YOU HALVE THIS YOU GET 
ADD THESE TOGETHER AND THAT GIVES TWO POINT FIVE OH MULTIPLIED BY FIFTEEN 
NOW WE JUST NEED TO ADD ONE MORE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY POUNDS 
TO GET TWO POINT FIVE OH MULTIPLIED BY SIXTEEN 
ANOTHER WAY TO MULTIPLY BY SIXTEEN 
IS TO MULTIPLY BY TWO AND THEN BY EIGHT 
THAT'S A NICE QUICK WAY TO GET THE ANSWER 
YOU MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT METHOD OF DOING THIS CALCULATION 
IF IT'S A METHOD YOU'RE HAPPY WITH 
YOU CAN SHOW YOUR WORKING AND GET THE RIGHT ANSWER 
THEN THAT'S FINE 
PART B. GIVES YOU THE PRICE OF A C. D. AT ONE POINT FOUR NINE EACH 
AND ASKS YOU TO CALCULATE THE COST OF FOUR 
ONE WAY OF DOING THIS IS TO THINK OF ONE POINT FOUR NINE AS NEARLY ONE POINT FIVE OH 
BECAUSE ONE POINT FOUR NINE IS ONE PENNY LESS THAN ONE POINT FIVE OH 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE AWAY FOUR TIMES ONE PENNY 
GIVING AN ANSWER OF 
FOR PART C. YOU'RE ASKED TO WORK OUT 
HOW MANY C. D. S. YOU CAN BUY WITH TWELVE 
ONE C. D. COSTS ONE POINT FOUR NINE 
SO YOU NEED TO DIVIDE TWELVE BY ONE POINT FOUR NINE 
BUT ONE POINT FOUR NINE IS NEARLY ONE POINT FIVE OH 
SO YOU WORK OUT THE NUMBER OF ONE POINT FIVE OHS THERE ARE IN TWELVE 
SO THERE ARE FOUR LOTS OF TWO MAKING EIGHT ONE POINT FIVE OHS IN TWELVE 
AS ONE POINT FOUR NINE IS ONE PENNY LESS THAN ONE POINT FIVE OH 
THERE WOULD BE A REMAINDER 
BUT THE QUESTION IS ASKING HOW MANY C. D.'S CAN BE BOUGHT 
SO THE ANSWER IS EIGHT 
FOR PART D. WE'RE TOLD THE SHOP ALSO SELLS C. D. S. IN PACKS OF THREE 
AND A PACK COSTS THREE POINT NINE NINE 
IF WE WANT TO FIND OUT HOW MANY PACKS CAN BE BOUGHT WITH TWELVE 
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THREE POINT NINE NINE IS NEARLY FOUR POINT OH OH 
SO IT'S A MATTER OF DIVIDING TWELVE BY FOUR 
AND THAT WOULD BE A GOOD BUY 
BECAUSE FOR THE SAME MONEY YOU'D GET THREE X. THREE EQUALS NINE C. D.'S 
BY BUYING THEM IN PACKS 
AND ONLY EIGHT BY BUYING THEM INDIVIDUALLY BARGAIN OR WHAT 
WHEN ADDING AND SUBTRACTING DECIMALS 
AND WHEN MULTIPLYING AND DIVIDING A DECIMAL BY A WHOLE NUMBER 
IN THIS SECTION WE'RE GOING TO REMIND OURSELVES ABOUT MULTIPLYING AND DIVIDING BOTH DECIMALS 
AND WHOLE NUMBERS BY MULTIPLES OF TEN 
A MULTIPLE OF TEN IS A NUMBER THAT TEN DIVIDES INTO 
FOR EXAMPLE ALL THE NUMBERS IN THE TEN TIMES TABLE 
A RULE TO REMEMBER HERE IS 
MORE PEOPLE TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE ARE GOING TO THE MOVIES 
THE BIG SCREEN IS BIG BUSINESS 
AND WHAT BRINGS THE CROWDS IN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
A BIG NAME STAR 
BUT BIG NAMES COST 
TAKE TOM CRUISE 
HE WALKED AWAY WITH A BASIC FEE OF TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS 
FOR HIS ROLE IN THE LEGAL THRILLER THE FIRM 
SO WHEN THE STUDIO ACCOUNTANTS WROTE OUT TOM'S PAY CHEQUE 
IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD PLACE VALUE 
THIS IS HOW YOU WRITE TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS 
A ONE A TWO AND ALL THESE ZEROES 
NOW ON THEIR OWN EACH DIGIT IS PRETTY UNIMPRESSIVE 
WHAT COUNTS IS WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL DIGITS ARE PLACED 
THAT GIVES A NUMBER ITS VALUE WHICH IS WHY WE CALL IT PLACE VALUE 
SO THE DIGIT ONE ALL ON ITS OWN IS WORTH JUST ONE UNIT 
BUT IF WE SHUNT IT UP ONE PLACE TO THE LEFT THE ONE IS NOW WORTH TEN 
SLAP A TWO IN HERE AND TEN ADD TWO MAKES TWELVE 
LET'S TRY PAYING TOM TEN TIMES AS MUCH AND MULTIPLY THAT TWELVE BY TEN 
WE MOVE ALL THE DIGITS ONE PLACE TO THE LEFT 
THEN ADD A ZERO TO HOLD THE NUMBERS IN THEIR NEW PLACE 
THE ONE IS NOW WORTH ONE HUNDRED WHAT'S MORE THE TWO HAS BEEN PROMOTED AS WELL 
IT'S NOW WORTH TWO LOTS OF TEN OR TWENTY 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS 
LET'S PAY TOM TEN TIMES MORE AGAIN 
MAKING A GRAND TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS 
I'LL HAVE TO CALL MY ACCOUNTANT 
RUMOUR HAS IT THAT WHEN JIM CARREY MADE ACE VENTURA WHEN NATURE CALLS 
HE DEMANDED THE FILM COMPANY NOT ONLY HIRE HIS PERSONAL CHEF 
BUT AN ADDITIONAL COOK FOR HIS PET IGUANA 
WEEKLY COST OF A PERSONAL CHEF 
WRITE THIS IN FIGURES NOW 
SO THAT'S ONE IN THE THOUSANDS COLUMN 
TWO HUNDREDS THERE AREN'T ANY TENS 
BUT THERE'S A FIVE IN THE UNITS COLUMN 
NOW BACK TO COOL MAN TOM C. 
HIS WAGE CHEQUE CURRENTLY STANDS AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS 
LET'S BEEF IT UP A BIT AND MULTIPLY IT BY ONE HUNDRED 
WE SHIFT EACH DIGIT TWO PLACES TO THE LEFT 
AND FILL IN WITH TWO ZEROES AT THE END TO HOLD THE NEW NUMBER IN PLACE 
LARGE NUMBERS LIKE THIS 
ARE OFTEN WRITTEN USING A SPACE AS A SEPARATOR 
THESE SPACES BREAK UP THE NUMBERS AFTER EVERY THREE DIGITS 
WORKING FROM THE RIGHT 
AND THEY MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FOR US TO WORK OUT EXACTLY HOW BIG THEY ARE 
AND HOW TO READ THEM 
SO THIS LITTLE BABY IS WORTH ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS 
BACK TO TOM'S PRINCELY FEE HE'S AFTER TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS 
A MILLION IS A THOUSAND THOUSANDS 
SO TWELVE MILLION IS WRITTEN LIKE THIS 
THERE YOU GO TOM 
WE MAY NOT ALL BE FILM STARS 
BUT DEALING WITH MULTIPLES OF TEN IS STILL IMPORTANT 
LET'S LOOK AT SOME EXAMPLES 
STARTING WITH FOUR X. TEN 
FOUR TENS IS FORTY 
LOOK HOW THE FOUR HAS MOVED ONE PLACE TO THE LEFT 
WE NEED THE ZERO TO SHOW THAT THE FOUR IS IN THE TENS COLUMN 
NOW MULTIPLY FORTY ONE BY TEN 
BOTH THE FOUR AND THE ONE HAVE MOVED ONE PLACE TO THE LEFT 
THE SAME HAPPENS WHEN WE HAVE FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX X. TEN 
WHEN WE MULTIPLY BY ONE HUNDRED THE DIGITS MOVE TWO PLACES 
FIVE X. ONE HUNDRED EQUALS FIVE HUNDRED 
WE ADD TWO ZEROS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FIVE STAYS IN THE HUNDREDS COLUMN 
FIVE POINT THREE X. ONE HUNDRED EQUALS FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY 
WE HAVE TO MOVE THE DIGITS AND ADD A ZERO TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THE FIVE AND THE THREE ARE IN THE CORRECT COLUMNS 
FORTY FIVE POINT SIX FOUR SEVEN X. ONE HUNDRED EQUALS FOUR FIVE SIX FOUR SEVEN 
YOU SHOULD NOW THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MULTIPLY BY ONE THOUSAND 
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL THOUGH 
YOU MAY HAVE LEARNT THAT YOU ADD A ZERO WHEN YOU MULTIPLY BY TEN 
THIS ONLY WORKS FOR WHOLE NUMBERS IT DOES NOT WORK FOR NUMBERS 
WITH DIGITS AFTER THE DECIMAL POINT 
IN THE SAME WAY ADDING TWO ZEROS ONLY WORKS FOR MULTIPLYING BY ONE HUNDRED 
WHEN THE NUMBER IS A WHOLE NUMBER 
DIVIDING IS THE OPPOSITE OR THE INVERSE OF MULTIPLYING 
SO WHEN WE DIVIDE BY TEN OR ONE HUNDRED YOU DO THE OPPOSITE TO MULTIPLYING 
TANGLE WITH A DIVISIONAL OPERATOR AND YOU'LL ALWAYS END UP LOSING 
HERE IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING AIR 
A LARGE FAMILY OF WHOLE NUMBERS ARE GRAZING CONTENTEDLY 
THEN A CARELESS FIVE THOUSAND STRAYS AWAY FROM THE SAFETY OF THE HERD 
IT'S WHAT THE CIRCLING DIVIDE BY TEN HAS BEEN WAITING FOR 
IN A BLUR OF MOVEMENT IT SWOOPS 
WITHIN SECONDS THE UNWARY FIVE THOUSAND HAS HAD ITS TRAILING ZERO SNATCHED 
IT'S JUST LEARNED THE HARD WAY THAT WHEN A NUMBER IS DIVIDED BY TEN 
ALL ITS DIGITS ARE DRAGGED PAINFULLY ONE PLACE TO THE RIGHT 
AND IF THAT FINAL DIGIT IS A ZERO 
AS IT WAS FOR THE POOR FIVE THOUSAND THEN IT IS LOST FOREVER 
PREPARE YOURSELVES TO SEE AN EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS ATTACK 
AS A POWERFUL DIVIDE BY ONE HUNDRED LAUNCHES ITSELF AT A LUMBERING NINE THOUSAND 
THE POOR CREATURE CAN DO NOTHING 
AS IT DISCOVERS THAT WHEN DIVIDED BY A ONE HUNDRED 
A NUMBER'S DIGITS ARE CLAWED NOT ONE 
BUT TWO PLACES TO THE RIGHT 
AND AS WITH DIVISION BY TEN 
IF THOSE DIGITS ARE ZEROS 
THEN THEY TOO WILL BE CARRIED OFF 
THOSE OF A NERVOUS DISPOSITION SHOULD LOOK AWAY NOW 
IN SPITE OF EVERY WARNING IT'S BEEN GIVEN BY ITS PARENTS 
A SILLY YOUNG THIRTEEN HAS WANDERED OFF TO PLAY ON ITS OWN 
IT'S SPOTTED BY A CIRCLING DIVIDE BY TEN 
UNLUCKY THIRTEEN 
AS EVER IN THE ATTACK ITS DIGITS ARE CLAWED ONE PLACE TO THE RIGHT 
SEE HOW LITTLE THIRTEEN HAS BEEN MADE EVEN SMALLER 
ITS THREE BEING PULLED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DECIMAL POINT 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A ZERO THE THREE ISN'T CARRIED OFF 
IT'S NOT MUCH OF A CONSOLATION 
IT MEANS THAT THE LITTLE THIRTEEN ISN'T A WHOLE NUMBER ANY MORE 
BUT THIRTEEN 
A DECIMAL NUMBER 
AUTOMATICALLY BANISHED FROM THE WHOLE NUMBERS FAMILY 
IT TRAILS SADLY AWAY TO LOOK FOR A FRIENDLY HERD OF DECIMALS 
LET'S LOOK IN MORE DETAIL AT DIVIDING BY TEN 
THIRTY TENTHS EQUALS THREE 
SO THE THREE MOVES TO THE RIGHT AND THE ZERO DISAPPEARS 
THIRTY NINE TENTHS EQUALS THIRTY NINE 
THIS TIME BOTH DIGITS MOVE TO THE RIGHT 
WE HAVE TO ADD A DECIMAL POINT TO SHOW THAT THE THREE IS THREE UNITS 
AND THE NINE IS NINE TENTHS 
AND THE SAME THING WORKS FOR DIVIDING BY ONE HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND 
HERE IS FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY ONE HUNDREDTHS 
AND HERE IS FORTY EIGHT ONE HUNDREDTHS 
NOTICE THAT WE USUALLY ADD A ZERO BEFORE THE DECIMAL POINT 
JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW IT IS BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE 
WE'LL LEAVE THE DIVIDING BY ONE THOUSAND UP TO YOU 
AND HERE IS ANOTHER WARNING 
REMEMBER THAT REMOVING ZEROS ONLY WORKS FOR MULTIPLES OF TEN 
WHEN YOU'RE DIVIDING BY TEN 
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK SO FOR EXAMPLE 
THREE TENTHS 
AND YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH DIVIDING BY ONE HUNDRED TOO 
THINK ABOUT WHY REMOVING TWO ZEROS WORKS HERE 
BUT NOT HERE 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO EXTEND THE IDEA 
OF MULTIPLYING AND DIVIDING BY TEN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND 
TO MULTIPLES OF TEN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND 
FIRST OF ALL MULTIPLYING 
TWENTY SIX X. THIRTY MULTIPLYING BY THIRTY 
IS THE SAME AS MULTIPLYING BY THREE AND THEN TEN 
TWENTY SIX X. THREE EQUALS SEVENTY EIGHT 
BECAUSE TWENTY X. THREE EQUALS SIXTY 
AND SIX X. THREE EQUALS EIGHTEEN 
SIXTY EIGHTEEN EQUALS SEVENTY EIGHT 
NOW WE MULTIPLY BY TEN 
MOVE THE DIGITS ONE PLACE TO THE LEFT 
SO THE FINAL ANSWER IS TWENTY SIX X. THIRTY EQUALS SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY 
THE NEXT EXAMPLE USES A MULTIPLE OF ONE HUNDRED 
TWO POINT ONE X. FOUR HUNDRED 
MULTIPLYING BY FOUR HUNDRED IS THE SAME AS MULTIPLYING BY FOUR AND THEN ONE HUNDRED 
TWO POINT ONE X. FOUR EQUALS EIGHTY FOUR 
NOW WE MULTIPLY BY ONE HUNDRED 
AND THE DIGITS MOVE TWO PLACES TO THE LEFT 
AND WE GET TWENTY ONE X. FOUR HUNDRED EQUALS EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY 
AND OUR THIRD EXAMPLE GOES UP INTO THE THOUSANDS 
THIRTEEN POINT FOUR X. TWO THOUSAND 
MULTIPLY BY TWO AND THEN BY ONE THOUSAND 
THIRTEEN POINT FOUR X. TWO EQUALS TWO HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT 
NOW WE MULTIPLY BY ONE THOUSAND 
AND THE DIGITS MOVE THREE PLACES TO THE LEFT 
THIS GIVES US THE ANSWER OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR X. TWO THOUSAND EQUALS TWENTY SIX THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED 
NOW THE DIVISION FOR EXAMPLE FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY T. H. S. 
DIVIDING FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED BY FIFTY 
IS THE SAME AS DIVIDING BY FIVE AND THEN DIVIDING BY TEN 
FIFTY FIVE FIFTHS EQUALS ELEVEN 
SO FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTHS EQUALS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED 
NOW WE HAVE TO DIVIDE BY TEN 
SO THE DIGITS WILL MOVE ONE PLACE TO THE RIGHT 
SO FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY T. H. S. EQUALS ONE HUNDRED TEN 
THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE HUNDREDTHS IS THE SAME AS DIVIDING BY THREE AND THEN BY ONE HUNDRED 
THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THIRDS EQUALS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
BECAUSE THIRTY SIX THIRDS EQUALS TWELVE 
NOW WE MOVE THE DIGITS TWO PLACES TO THE RIGHT 
BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE TO DIVIDE BY ONE HUNDRED 
SO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE HUNDREDTHS EQUALS TWELVE 
AND FINALLY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY NINTHS 
FORTY FIVE NINTHS EQUALS FIVE 
SO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY NINTHS EQUALS FIFTY 
WE THEN DIVIDED BY ONE THOUSAND 
SO THE DIGITS MOVE THREE PLACES TO THE RIGHT 
THIS MEANS THAT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY NINTHS EQUALS OH OH FIVE 
TO FINISH THIS SECTION ON DIVIDING 
LOOK AT THESE DIVISION PATTERNS 
WRITE DOWN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ANSWER 
WHEN THE FIRST NUMBER GETS BIGGER 
WHY DO YOU THINK THIS HAPPENS 
IN THIS EXAMPLE THE FIRST NUMBER IS GETTING SMALLER 
NOW LOOK CAREFULLY AT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ANSWER 
IF THE SECOND NUMBER GETS BIGGER 
AND WHEN IT GETS SMALLER 
CAN YOU SEE THE PATTERN 
JOT DOWN THE NUMBERS AND HAVE A GO YOURSELF 
ONE POINT TWO OH MULTIPLIED BY ONE OF THESE NUMBERS GIVES ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
THEN TWELVE DIVIDED BY ANOTHER GIVES TWELVE 
TWELVE MULTIPLIED BY ANOTHER GIVES SIX THOUSAND 
ZERO POINT SIX MULTIPLIED BY ANOTHER GIVES SIX HUNDRED 
AND FINALLY SIX HUNDRED DIVIDED BY ONE OF THE NUMBERS GIVES TWELVE 
BEFORE WE WORK IT OUT TOGETHER 
IT MAY BE A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO STOP THE TAPE 
AND HAVE A GO AT THE QUESTION YOURSELF 
LET'S WORK THROUGH THESE ONE AT A TIME 
FIRST OF ALL ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MULTIPLIED BY ONE OF THESE NUMBERS GIVES ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
ONE POINT TWO OH HAS BEEN MULTIPLIED BY A NUMBER 
THAT HAS SIMPLY MOVED THE DIGITS TO THE LEFT WITHOUT CHANGING THEM 
THIS MEANS THAT THE MISSING NUMBER MUST BE TEN ONE HUNDRED OR ONE THOUSAND 
THE DIGITS HAVE MOVED TO THE LEFT BECAUSE WE ARE MULTIPLYING 
THEY'VE MOVED TWO PLACES 
WHICH MEANS THAT THE MISSING NUMBER MUST HAVE TWO ZEROS 
SO THE ANSWER YOU WANT IS ONE HUNDRED 
TWELVE DIVIDED BY WHAT EQUALS TWELVE 
AND THE QUESTION DOESN'T SAY THAT THE MISSING NUMBERS ONLY APPEAR IN ONE CALCULATION 
SO KEEP LOOKING AT ALL OF THEM 
AGAIN TWELVE HAS BEEN DIVIDED BY A NUMBER 
THAT HAS SIMPLY MOVED THE FIGURES TO THE RIGHT WITHOUT CHANGING THEM 
THIS MEANS THAT ONCE AGAIN 
THE MISSING NUMBER MUST BE TEN ONE HUNDRED OR ONE THOUSAND 
THIS TIME THE FIGURES HAVE MOVED TO THE RIGHT BECAUSE WE ARE DIVIDING 
BUT THEY HAVE MOVED ONLY ONE PLACE 
SO THE MISSING NUMBER MUST BE TEN 
TWELVE MULTIPLIED BY A MISSING NUMBER 
TEN FIFTY ONE HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED OR ONE THOUSAND 
GIVES THE ANSWER SIX THOUSAND 
HERE TWELVE MUST BE MULTIPLIED 
BY SOMETHING OTHER THAN TEN ONE HUNDRED OR ONE THOUSAND 
BECAUSE THE DIGITS ONE AND TWO DO NOT APPEAR IN THE ANSWER 
SO TWELVE MUST BE MULTIPLIED BY FIFTY OR FIVE HUNDRED 
NOW TWELVE X. FIVE EQUALS SIXTY 
BUT WE WANT THE ANSWER SIX THOUSAND 
THIS IS A HUNDRED TIMES BIGGER THAN SIXTY 
SO IF WE MULTIPLY TWELVE NOT BY FIVE 
BUT BY A NUMBER ONE HUNDRED TIMES LARGER THAT'S FIVE HUNDRED 
THIS GIVES THE ANSWER SIX THOUSAND 
NOW OH SIX MULTIPLIED BY WHAT EQUALS SIX HUNDRED 
WE CAN SEE THAT OH SIX HAS BEEN MULTIPLIED BY A NUMBER 
THAT HAS SIMPLY MOVED THE FIGURE TO THE LEFT WITHOUT CHANGING IT 
SO THIS MEANS THAT THE MISSING NUMBER MUST BE TEN ONE HUNDRED OR ONE THOUSAND 
THE FIGURE HAS MOVED TO THE LEFT BECAUSE WE ARE MULTIPLYING 
AND IT HAS MOVED THREE PLACES 
WHICH MEANS THE MISSING NUMBER MUST HAVE THREE ZEROS 
SO THE MISSING NUMBER MUST BE ONE THOUSAND 
SIX HUNDRED DIVIDED BY WHICH OF THE MISSING NUMBERS GIVES THE ANSWER TWELVE 
YOU CAN'T GET THE ANSWER SIMPLY BY MOVING THE SIX HUNDRED TO THE RIGHT 
SO SIX HUNDRED MUST BE DIVIDED BY FIFTY OR FIVE HUNDRED 
SIXTY FIFTHS EQUALS TWELVE 
SO SIX HUNDRED FIFTY T. H. S. WILL ALSO BE TWELVE 
THAT MEANS THE MISSING NUMBER MUST BE FIFTY 
THAT'S IT FOR THIS SECTION ON WHOLE NUMBERS AND DECIMALS 
IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND 
JUST GO BACK AND TAKE ANOTHER LOOK 
THIS NEXT SECTION IS ALL ABOUT UNDERSTANDING FRACTIONS 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE 
CONVERTING BETWEEN FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 
AND ADDING AND SUBTRACTING FRACTIONS 
LET'S START WITH BASIC FRACTIONS 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS 
YOU'VE GOT A ROUND CAKE YOU'VE GOT TO CUT IT INTO EIGHT EQUAL PIECES 
YOU ONLY HAVE THREE STRAIGHT CUTS WITH THE KNIFE 
AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO MOVE THE PIECES BETWEEN CUTS 
YOU CUT IT ACROSS THERE 
DOWN 
AND THEN YOU CROSS IT THERE 
AND THEN CROSS IT AND CUT THERE 
NO I CAN'T DO IT BOYS AREN'T ALLOWED TO CUT 
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T GOT IT THIS IS REALLY HOW IT WORKS 
YOU DO ONE CHOP ACROSS THERE LIKE THAT THAT MAKES TWO PIECES 
AND THEN LIKE THAT THAT MAKES FOUR EQUAL PIECES 
BUT THE BIG TRICK DID YOU GET IT 
YOU DO THE THIRD ONE THROUGH THERE 
THERE WE GO EIGHT EQUAL PIECES 
FRACTIONS ARE A WAY OF CUTTING WHOLE NUMBERS INTO SECTIONS 
COUNTING BETWEEN THE WHOLE NUMBERS 
A HALF THAT'S WHEN THE WHOLE THING IS DIVIDED INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS 
IT'S WRITTEN LIKE THIS 
QUARTERS ARE FOUR EQUAL PARTS 
IT'S WHEN THE WHOLE THING IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR 
AND IS WRITTEN LIKE THIS 
THIS FRACTION IS CALLED AN EIGHTH 
BECAUSE WE'VE DIVIDED THE WHOLE INTO EIGHT PARTS 
AND WE'VE CHOSEN ONE OF THOSE PARTS 
THIS FRACTION IS CALLED THREE EIGHTHS 
BECAUSE WE DIVIDE THE WHOLE INTO EIGHT PARTS AND CHOOSE THREE PARTS 
HERE ARE SOME MORE FRACTIONS 
THAT'S WHEN THE WHOLE HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO NINE EQUAL PARTS 
AND WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED SEVEN OF THEM 
THAT'S WHEN THE WHOLE HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO ONE HUNDRED EQUAL PARTS 
AND WE'VE SHADED THIRTY TWO OF THEM 
FOUR NINTHS IS WHERE THE WHOLE HAS BEEN CUT INTO NINE EQUAL PARTS 
AND WE'VE SHADED FOUR OF THEM 
LET'S LOOK AT SOME SPECIAL VOCABULARY 
THE NUMBER ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FRACTION IS CALLED THE DENOMINATOR 
THE NUMBER ON THE TOP IS CALLED THE NUMERATOR 
WE'VE SO FAR DEALT WITH FRACTIONS OF A WHOLE UNIT 
BUT FRACTIONS CAN ALSO BE FRACTIONS OF A NUMBER MORE THAN ONE 
TO HELP US WITH THIS WE'VE CALLED AN EXPERT POOL PLAYER 
IN POOL THE BALLS ARE ARRANGED SO THERE ARE SEVEN RED SEVEN YELLOW 
AND ONE BLACK 
THE DIFFERENT COLOURED BALLS IN THE TRIANGLE CAN BE THOUGHT OF 
AS A FRACTION OF THE SET OF FIFTEEN BALLS 
LET'S LOOK AT THE RED FIRST 
THERE ARE SEVEN RED BALLS OUT OF A TOTAL OF FIFTEEN IN THE TRIANGLE 
THEY REPRESENT SEVEN OUT OF FIFTEEN OR SEVEN FIFTEENTHS 
THE SAME APPLIES TO THE YELLOW BALLS 
THE ONE BLACK BALL IS ONE OUT OF FIFTEEN OR ONE FIFTEENTH OF THE WHOLE SET 
OUR POOL PLAYER IS GOING TO BREAK THE RULES OF THE GAME 
THIS TIME HE'S ARRANGING THE BALLS IN A RECTANGLE 
SO THERE ARE FIVE OUT OF FIFTEEN OF EACH COLOUR 
AS A FACTION THAT WOULD BE 
ALWAYS REMEMBER TO CANCEL DOWN AS FAR AS POSSIBLE 
THIS MEANS YOU HAVE TO DIVIDE THE NUMERATOR AND DENOMINATOR 
BY THE LARGEST POSSIBLE NUMBER 
FOR EXAMPLE 
GOING BACK TO OUR RECTANGULAR BALLS 
WE CAN SEE EACH COLOUR MAKES UP ONE THIRD OF THE RECTANGLE OF BALLS 
SO THAT'S THE BASIS OF CANCELLING DOWN 
SIMILARLY TWO QUARTERS CAN BE CANCELLED DOWN TO A HALF 
TWO TWELFTHS CAN BE CANCELLED DOWN TO ONE SIXTH 
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE 
SIMPLIFY TWENTY FOUR OVER THIRTY SIX 
LET'S MOVE ON TO FINDING THE FRACTION OF A NUMBER 
TO FIND THREE FIFTHS OF TWENTY THE EASY WAY IS TO FIND ONE FIFTH OF TWENTY FIRST 
THREE FIFTHS OF TWENTY IS TWELVE 
LET'S LOOK AT OH ONE 
WE HAVE NO UNITS AND ONE TENTH AFTER THE DECIMAL POINT 
LET'S PUT THAT NUMBER ONTO A NUMBER LINE 
IT WILL GO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN NOUGHT AND ONE 
ZERO POINT ONE GOES HERE FOLLOWED BY OH TWO AND YOU CARRY ON UNTIL YOU GET TO OH NINE 
AND THEN YOU HAVE ONE WHOLE ONE 
OR YOU CAN PUT IT ON A FRACTION NUMBER LINE BETWEEN NOUGHT AND ONE 
HERE YOU'D WRITE IT AS ONE TENTH FOLLOWED BY TWO TENTHS 
AND YOU'D CARRY ON TILL YOU GET TO NINE TENTHS 
AND THEN IT'D BE FOLLOWED BY ONE WHOLE ONE 
NOW OUR PLAYER'S GOING TO POT TWO BALLS OR TWO TENTHS 
LET'S TAKE OH TWO WE HAVE NO UNITS AND WE HAVE TWO TENTHS 
LET'S TAKE A NUMBER TO TWO DECIMAL PLACES 
WHAT ABOUT OH TWO FIVE 
HERE WE HAVE NO UNITS TWO TENTHS AND FIVE HUNDREDTHS 
LET'S FIND A COMMON FACTOR SO WE CAN CANCEL THAT DOWN 
AND THAT WOULD BE TWENTY FIVE SO THAT'S ONE QUARTER 
O. K. HOW ABOUT A NUMBER TO THREE DECIMAL PLACES 
LIKE OH TWO FIVE FIVE 
HERE WE'VE GOT NO UNITS TWO TENTHS FIVE HUNDREDTHS AND FIVE THOUSANDTHS 
WE FIND A COMMON FACTOR LET'S DIVIDE IT BY FIVE 
WHEN YOU'RE CONVERTING DECIMALS TO FRACTIONS 
HOWEVER MANY NUMBERS YOU HAVE AFTER THE DECIMAL POINT 
THAT'LL BE THE SAME AS THE NUMBER OF ZEROS IN YOUR DENOMINATOR 
LET'S TAKE SOME EXAMPLES HERE 
ZERO POINT TWO THAT'S ONE DIGIT AFTER THE DECIMAL POINT 
ONE NOUGHT IN THE DENOMINATOR 
ZERO POINT TWO TWO YOU'VE GOT TWO DIGITS AFTER THE DECIMAL POINT 
HOW MANY NOUGHTS HAVE YOU GOT IN THE DENOMINATOR 
ONE TWO 
ONE MORE EXAMPLE OH TWO TWO TWO 
HOW MANY DIGITS AFTER THE DECIMAL POINT 
THAT'S THREE HOW MANY NOUGHTS IN YOUR DENOMINATOR 
ONE TWO THREE 
THAT'S A KEY POINT 
NOW WE'VE TACKLED CONVERTING FROM DECIMALS TO FRACTIONS 
LET'S LOOK AT THEM THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
CONVERTING FROM FRACTIONS TO DECIMALS 
WELCOME TO THE FASHION EVENT OF THE YEAR 
YES TODAY WE'LL BE GETTING OUR FIRST LOOK AT THE FABULOUS NEW DECIMAL COLLECTION 
A COLLECTION WHICH THE DESIGNERS CLAIM 
WILL TURN ANY FRAYED AND FRUMPY FRACTION INTO A DROP DEAD DECIMAL 
WILL THE DECIMAL LOOK BE ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE 
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT 
OH YES ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
IN DECIMAL STYLE THAT RATHER PLAIN ONE TENTH HAS BECOME 
THE COOLEST SMOOTHEST OH ONE YOU COULD HOPE TO SEE 
THE DESIGNERS CLAIM THAT THE DECIMAL LOOK WORKS FOR EVERY FRACTION 
WHATEVER THEIR SHAPE 
TALL SHORT SKINNY OR EVEN BIGGER BOTTOMED 
LIKE THIS ONE HUNDREDTH 
LET'S SEE IF IT'S TRUE 
OH IT IS INDEED TOO CHIC 
THAT ONE HUNDREDTH HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED 
INTO A DELIGHTFULLY DECIMAL OH OH ONE 
JUST LOOK AT THAT STYLISH LITTLE ONE IN THE HUNDREDTHS COLUMN 
WHAT A DELICIOUS DETAIL 
ABSOLUTELY LOVELY 
NEXT IN THE CATALOGUE IS WELL LET'S BE HONEST 
A RATHER PLAIN LOOKING HALF 
I WONDER WHAT THE DECIMAL LOOK WILL DO THERE 
WELL THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH A SIMPLE LITTLE NUMBER LIKE THAT 
ABSOLUTELY IDEAL FOR EVERYDAY USE 
AND NOW SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT 
A STUNNING BEFORE AND AFTER PARADE SHOWING VARIOUS FRACTIONS ALONGSIDE THEIR DECIMAL EQUIVALENTS 
YES THE OH SO COOL DECIMAL POINT 
IS DEFINITELY THIS SEASON'S MUST HAVE ACCESSORY 
SO IF YOU'RE A FASHION CONSCIOUS FRACTION THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR 
GET STYLISH GET DECIMAL 
FINALE TIME 
WHAT HAVE THE DECIMAL DESIGNERS GOT UP THEIR SLEEVES 
OOH OH MY GOODNESS 
WELL IT'S NOT A LOOK THAT WILL SUIT EVERY FRACTION 
BUT I'M QUITE SURE THERE'LL BE SOME WHO LIKE IT 
PERHAPS YOU CAN THINK OF A FEW 
THIS IS IVOR POINT AT THE DROP DEAD DECIMAL SHOW 
RETURNING YOU THE THE STUDIO 
HOW DO WE ACTUALLY CONVERT A FRACTION TO ITS EQUIVALENT DECIMAL 
TO CONVERT THREE TENTHS TO A DECIMAL WE CAN USE DIVISION 
TEN INTO THREE DOESN'T GO 
PUT A ZERO DECIMAL POINT DECIMAL POINT KEEP THEM IN THE SAME PLACE 
WE CARRY THE THREE OVER 
NOW WE HAVE TEN INTO THIRTY THAT GOES T. HREE TIMES EXACTLY 
SO THREE TENTHS CAN BE WRITTEN AS A DECIMAL IN THE FORM OF OH THREE 
WE C. A. ALSO SEE THIS ON A NUMBER LINE 
THREE TENTHS IS THE SAME AS OH THREE 
TAKE ANOTHER FRACTION TWO FIFTHS 
LET'S CONVERT THAT TO A DECIMAL IN THE SAME WAY 
LET'S SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE 
TWO FIFTHS IS EQUAL TO FOUR TENTHS 
FOUR TENTHS IS EQUAL TO OH FOUR 
SOMETIMES THE NUMBERS TO BE DIVIDED ARE NOT QUITE AS EASY 
LET'S LOOK AT RECURRING DECIMALS 
LET'S TAKE ONE THIRD AND CONVERT IT INTO DECIMALS 
YOU NOTICE SOMETHING INTERESTING HERE 
THREE INTO TEN GOES THREE WITH A REMAINDER OF ONE 
AND SO ON AND SO ON 
LET'S CHECK THAT WITH A CALCULATOR 
WE COULD WRITE ONE THIRD AS OH THREE THREE 
BUT BECAUSE THE THREES KEEP ON COMING AGAIN AND AGAIN THEY'RE RECURRING 
WE CALL THIS A RECURRING DECIMAL 
TO SHOW THAT WE PUT A TINY DOT ABOVE THE THREE 
THAT INDICATES IT'S A RECURRING DECIMAL 
LET'S GO ON TO ANOTHER EXAMPLE 
THREE INTO TWENTY GOES SIX TIMES WITH 
A REMAINDER OF TWO AGAIN SIX TIMES THAT'S RECURRING 
THREE INTO TWO IS OH SIX SIX SIX RECURRING 
IF WE WANT TO ROUND THE ANSWER TO TWO DECIMAL PLACES IT WOULD BE OH SIX SEVEN 
HERE ARE FIVE NUMBER CARDS JOT THEM DOWN 
THREE OF THEM SHOW DECIMALS AND TWO SHOW FRACTIONS 
STOP THE TAPE AND HAVE A GO AT THE QUESTION YOURSELF 
PART A WE NEED TO FIND THE DECIMAL CARD EQUIVALENT TO SEVEN TENTHS 
THE FIRST NUMBER AFTER THE DECIMAL POINT 
ALWAYS TELL US THE NUMBER OF TENTHS 
SO THE EQUIVALENT OF SEVEN TENTHS MUST BE OH SEVEN 
FOR PART B. WE NEED TO FIND THE FRACTION EQUIVALENT TO OH EIGHT 
ZERO POINT EIGHT IS EQUAL TO EIGHT TENTHS 
BUT THERE IS NO EIGHT TENTHS CARD 
EIGHT TENTHS CAN BE SIMPLIFIED 
BY DIVIDING THE NUMERATOR AND THE DENOMINATOR BY TWO 
MAKING IT FOUR FIFTHS AND THAT DOES MATCH ONE OF THE CARDS 
IF YOU'RE IN ANY DOUBT ABOUT AN ANSWER 
YOU CAN CHECK IT BY LOOKING AT IT THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
IN PART C. WE NEED TO FIND THE DECIMAL 
EQUIVALENT TO THREE QUARTERS 
AN EASY WAY TO CONVERT A FRACTION IS 
IN THIS CASE IT MEANS DIVIDING THREE BY FOUR 
YOU COULD ALSO LOOK AT THE NUMBER LINE 
DRAW THE FRACTION NEXT TO THE LINE 
FOR PART D. WE NEED TO SEE WHICH CARDS ARE LEFT OVER 
AND IF THEY ARE EQUIVALENT 
THE TWO CARDS LEFT OVER ARE THREE TWENTIETHS AND OH ONE FIVE 
LET'S SEE IF THEY ARE EQUIVALENT 
YOU CAN ONLY ADD OR SUBTRACT FRACTIONS 
THAT HAVE THE SAME DENOMINATOR 
SO YOU ADD AND SUBTRACT THE SAME TYPE OF FRACTION 
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE DENOMINATORS ARE DIFFERENT 
IF WE HAVE FRACTIONS WITH DIFFERENT DENOMINATORS 
WE HAVE TO CONVERT THEM INTO THE SAME TYPE OF FRACTION 
SO WE'RE USING A COMMON DENOMINATOR THEY HAVE THE SAME DENOMINATOR 
FOUR AND SIX BOTH GO INTO TWELVE 
LET'S CONVERT THOSE INTO TWELVE 
YOU'VE CONVERTED A QUARTER INTO A TWELFTH THERE 
LET'S DO THE SAME FOR THE SIX 
WHATEVER YOU DO TO THE DENOMINATOR 
YOU MUST REMEMBER TO DO TO THE NUMERATOR AS WELL 
ONE SIXTH CAN BE WRITTEN AS TWO TWELFTHS 
NOW WE HAVE THE SAME DENOMINATOR WE CAN ADD THE TWO FRACTIONS TOGETHER 
BECAUSE THEY ARE OF THE SAME TYPE 
LET'S MOVE ON TO SUBTRACTION 
AGAIN WE HAVE TO HAVE A COMMON DENOMINATOR 
SO WE NEED TO CONVERT THE FOUR AND THE SIX INTO TWELFTHS 
BOTH NUMBERS GO INTO TWELVE LET'S DO THAT AGAIN 
ONE FOURTH FOUR X. THREE 
GIVES YOU TWELVE 
WE HAVE TO DO THE SAME TO THE NUMERATOR 
AS WE HAVE DONE TO THE DENOMINATOR 
ONE X. THREE THREE 
LET'S DO THE SAME FOR THE SIX 
SIX X. TWO EQUALS TWELVE 
AGAIN DO THE SAME TO THE NUMERATOR 
ONE X. TWO EQUALS TWO 
NOW WE CAN SUBTRACT OUR FRACTIONS 
THIS TIME WE'VE GOT 
THREE TWELFTHS MINUS TWO TWELFTHS 
EQUALS ONE TWELFTH 
ONE QUARTER MINUS ONE SIXTH EQUALS ONE TWELFTH 
HOW MANY EIGHTHS ARE THERE IN ONE QUARTER 
NOW WORK OUT THREE QUARTERS AND ONE EIGHTH 
WRITE THE MISSING NUMBERS 
IN THESE FRACTION SUMS 
ONE QUARTER PLUS SOMETHING OVER EIGHT EQUALS ONE 
ONE THIRD PLUS EIGHT OVER SOMETHING EQUALS ONE 
YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE DIVIDING WITH FRACTIONS 
THIS DOESN'T MATTER IN THIS QUESTION 
YOU CAN DO IT ALL WITH EQUIVALENT FRACTIONS 
IF WE DRAW A SHAPE INTO QUARTERS AND EIGHTHS 
WE CAN SEE THERE ARE TWO EIGHTHS IN EVERY ONE QUARTER 
SO THE ANSWER IS TWO 
ANOTHER WAY IS TO SAY THAT ONE QUARTER IS EQUIVALENT TO TWO EIGHTHS 
WE MULTIPLY THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM OF THE FRACTION BY TWO 
SO THERE MUST BE TWO EIGHTHS IN ONE QUARTER THE ANSWER IS TWO 
THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION IS THREE QUARTERS AND ONE EIGHTH 
THIS IS ASKING YOU HOW MANY EIGHTHS ARE THERE IN THREE QUARTERS 
IF WE LOOK AT THE DIAGRAM AGAIN 
WE CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE SIX EIGHTHS IN THREE QUARTERS 
SO THE ANSWER IS SIX 
YOU CAN DO THIS WITH EQUIVALENT FRACTIONS TOO 
WE GET THE SAME ANSWER OF SIX EIGHTHS IN A QUARTER 
WE GET THE SAME ANSWER OF SIX EIGHTHS IN A QUARTER 
SO THREE QUARTERS AND ONE EIGHTH EQUALS SIX 
WRITE THE MISSING NUMBERS IN THESE FRACTION SUMS 
A QUARTER PLUS SOMETHING OVER EIGHT EQUALS ONE 
WE CAN SEE THAT WHEN WE TAKE OUT ONE QUARTER 
THERE ARE THREE QUARTERS LEFT 
BUT WE HAVE TO GIVE OUR ANSWER IN EIGHTHS 
SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE EQUIVALENT FRACTION TO THREE QUARTERS IN EIGHTHS 
MULTIPLY THE DENOMINATOR BY TWO TO GET FROM FOUR TO EIGHT 
AND THE NUMERATOR BY TWO WHICH TAKES US FROM THREE TO SIX 
SO THE ANSWER IS SIX EIGHTHS 
NOW TO THE SECOND PART 
WE NEED TO FIND A FRACTION THAT MAKES A WHOLE WHEN ADDED TO ONE THIRD 
TAKE ONE THIRD OUT AND WE'RE LEFT WITH TWO THIRDS 
BUT WE'RE AFTER A FRACTION THAT HAS A NUMERATOR OF EIGHT 
WE GET THAT IF WE MULTIPLY THE NUMERATOR OF TWO THIRDS BY FOUR 
TWO X. FOUR EQUALS EIGHT 
WE MUST ALSO MULTIPLY THE DENOMINATOR OF OUR FRACTION BY FOUR 
THREE X. FOUR EQUALS TWELVE 
THIS GIVES US EIGHT TWELFTHS AND SO THE MISSING NUMBER IS TWELVE 
REMEMBER TO DRAW DIAGRAMS TO HELP YOU SOLVE FRACTION PROBLEMS 
THIS NEXT SECTION IS ABOUT PERCENTAGES 
WHAT THEY MEAN AND HOW TO WORK THEM OUT 
PERCENTAGES SEEM TO BE EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK 
YOU OFTEN SEE SIGNS OFFERING REDUCTIONS 
YOU MAY ALSO HEAR ABOUT PERCENTAGES IN THE NEWS 
TO ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE TO TRAINING NEWLY QUALIFIED NURSES 
ARE EXPECTED TO GET ELEVEN PER CENT 
TEACHERS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO GET A PAY RISE OF BETWEEN THREE PER CENT AND FOUR PER CENT 
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES ITS RESPONSE TO THE PAY REVIEW BODIES 
BUT BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER TAKE A LOOK AT THIS 
MOST OF THE NUMBERS WE COME ACROSS ARE AMOUNTS AND QUANTITIES 
TWO METRES OF CLOTH THREE HANDKERCHIEFS TWENTY FIVE P. IN CHANGE AND SO ON 
AND IF I CHANGE THE AMOUNT I CHANGE THE NUMBER NOW IT'S FIFTY P. 
BUT PERCENTAGES AND RATIOS ARE WAYS OF SHARING THINGS OUT PER CENT MEANS PARTS IN ONE HUNDRED 
ONE PER CENT MEANS ONE PART IN ONE HUNDRED 
SIX PER CENT MEANS SIX PARTS OUT OF ONE HUNDRED AND SO ON 
SO A PERCENTAGE IS A FRACTION OF ONE HUNDRED 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF ANYTHING IS THE WHOLE LOT 
SO IF ONE SOCK IS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT PURE WOOL 
A PAIR OF THE SAME SOCKS IS ALSO ONE HUNDRED PER CENT PURE WOOL 
IF I IMAGINE SOMETHING DIVIDED INTO ONE HUNDRED PARTS 
THEN THE NUMBER IN FRONT OF THE PER CENT SIGN 
TELLS ME HOW MANY PARTS ARE MY SHARE 
THE BEST WAY TO THINK OF PERCENTAGES IS AS PENNIES IN THE POUND 
WITH ONE HUNDRED PENNIES IN A POUND TEN PER CENT IS TEN PARTS OF THE ONE HUNDRED OR TEN P. 
FIFTY PER CENT IS FIFTY P. AND ONE HUNDRED PER CENT IS ONE HUNDRED P. 
THE WHOLE LOT 
IF A SALE SIGN SAYS THERE'S TEN PER CENT OFF THE MARKED PRICES 
THEN ON SOMETHING MARKED ONE I WOULD SAVE TEN P. 
ON SOMETHING MARKED TWO I WOULD SAVE TWO LOTS OF TEN P. TWENTY P. 
AND ON SOMETHING MARKED THREE I'D SAVE THIRTY P. 
THE ACTUAL AMOUNT I SAVE VARIES TEN P. TWENTY P. THIRTY P. 
BUT THE SAVING IS TEN PER CENT OF THE ORIGINAL PRICE 
YOU MAY ALREADY UNDERSTAND THAT A ONE QUARTER IS A ONE HALF DIVIDED BY TWO 
ANOTHER WAY OF FINDING TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IS TO DIVIDE BY FOUR 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE QUARTER 
THE OTHER PERCENTAGES THAT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT A CALCULATOR ARE 
TEN PER CENT IS EQUIVALENT TO ONE TENTH 
SO HOW ABOUT THIS CAFE 
WELL THERE'S NO OBVIOUS PERCENTAGE SIGNS HERE BUT WATCH OUT 
PERCENTAGES COULD LEAVE YOU WITH A BAD TASTE IN YOUR MOUTH 
YOU FANCY SOME CHIPS WELL YOU NEED TO DECIDE TO EAT IN OR TAKE AWAY 
IN THIS CAFE THEY CHARGE AN OPTIONAL TEN PER CENT EXTRA TO EAT IN 
YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT TEN PER CENT EXTRA ON YOUR BILL MEANS TO YOUR POCKET 
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST ME TO EAT IN 
ALL I WANT IS SOME CHIPS WHICH COST EIGHTY P. 
BUT I'LL BE CHARGED AN EXTRA TEN PER CENT TO EAT IN HANG ON 
NOW WE KNOW THAT TEN PER CENT OF EIGHTY P. 
IS THE SAME AS ONE TENTH OF EIGHTY P. 
THAT'S ONE TENTH OF EIGHTY P. 
SO YOU DIVIDE EIGHTY P. BY TEN 
AND YOU GET EIGHT P. 
SO IT'S GOING TO COST ME EIGHT P. TO EAT IN THIS CAFE HARDLY DRASTIC 
I MAY AS WELL PAY UP AND ENJOY 
THE DIGITS MOVE ONE PLACE TO THE RIGHT AND WE GET FIFTY FIVE 
BUT BECAUSE IT'S MONEY WE WRITE FIVE POINT FIVE OH 
NOW WE CAN DOUBLE IT TO GET TWENTY PER CENT 
MULTIPLE BY THREE TO GET THIRTY PER CENT 
MULTIPLY BY FOUR TO GET FORTY PER CENT AND SO ON 
WE CAN ALSO FIND OTHER PERCENTAGES THAT ARE LINKED TO TEN PER CENT 
SUCH AS FIVE PER CENT DIVIDING TEN PER CENT BY TWO 
LET'S GO BACK TO OUR EATING JOINT 
YOU REALLY HAVE TO WATCH THESE PERCENTAGE EXTRAS 
EVEN WHEN THERE'S NO TAKE AWAY OPTION 
THEY STILL OFTEN SLAP ON AN OPTIONAL SERVICE CHARGE 
A TIP THAT'S AUTOMATICALLY ADDED TO THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BILL 
AND IT'S ALWAYS A PERCENTAGE 
CHECK IT OUT 
THIS RESTAURANT IS WHACKING ON A FIFTEEN PER CENT OPTIONAL SERVICE CHARGE 
IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS IT REALLY WORTH THE MONEY 
HOW CAN YOU DECIDE 
WHAT ABOUT MORE COMPLICATED PERCENTAGES 
THAT CAN'T BE CALCULATED FROM TEN PER CENT 
LET'S CONSIDER AN AWKWARD PERCENTAGE LIKE THREE PER CENT OF TWENTY FOUR 
LET'S REMIND OURSELVES THAT PERCENTAGES ARE PARTS OF ONE HUNDRED 
SO THREE PER CENT IS THREE PARTS OUT OF ONE HUNDRED 
NOW WE CAN EXPRESS THIS AS A DECIMAL 
OF IN MATHEMATICS IS THE SAME AS MULTIPLY 
SO THREE PER CENT OF TWENTY FOUR IS THE SAME AS 
THAT EQUALS 
HOW ABOUT REMINDING OURSELVES 
HOW TO EXPRESS ONE FIGURE AS A PERCENTAGE OF ANOTHER 
LET'S TAKE A MATHS CLASS AS AN EXAMPLE 
WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS THE NUMBER OF BOYS IN THE CLASS AS A PERCENTAGE 
LET'S WRITE IT AS A FRACTION 
NOW WE CAN SIMPLIFY THIS BY DIVIDING THE NUMERATOR AND THE DENOMINATOR 
WE EXPRESSED IT AS A FRACTION 
WE MULTIPLY THIS BY ONE HUNDRED TO GET OUR PERCENTAGE 
PERCENTAGES ARE NOT ONLY USEFUL FOR WHEN WE'RE LOOKING FOR A BARGAIN 
THEY'RE ALSO IMPORTANT FOR SHOPS WHEN THEY'RE WORKING OUT PROFITS 
PERCENTAGE PROFIT IS DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT OF PROFIT 
DIVIDED BY THE ORIGINAL PRICE MULTIPLIED BY ONE HUNDRED 
LET'S SUPPOSE WE'RE IN A SHOE SHOP AND THERE IS A PAIR OF BOOTS 
THAT IS BOUGHT FOR SIXTY AND SOLD AT SIXTY NINE 
WE HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES WHOSE ORIGINAL PRICE IS SIXTY 
NOW OF THAT SIXTY NINE IS PROFIT 
WE WISH TO EXPRESS THAT PROFIT OF NINE AS A PERCENTAGE 
WE HAVE A FORMULA THAT CAN HELP US TO CALCULATE THIS 
PERCENTAGE PROFIT EQUALS PROFIT ORIGINAL PRICE X. ONE HUNDRED 
SO LET'S PUT THE NUMBERS IN 
WE CAN TAKE THE PROFIT OF NINE 
AND DIVIDE THAT BY THE ORIGINAL PRICE OF SIXTY 
WE CAN SIMPLIFY THIS DIVIDING BOTH THE NUMERATOR AND DENOMINATOR BY THREE 
TO GIVE THREE OVER TWENTY 
RIGHT TO FIND THE PERCENTAGE THREE OVER TWENTY X. ONE HUNDRED 
THIS GIVES US THREE HUNDRED TWENTY 
THIS SIMPLIFIES TO THIRTY OVER TWO 
AND AN ANSWER OF FIFTEEN PER CENT 
THE QUESTION ASKS YOU TO WRITE THE MISSING NUMBERS 
FIFTY PER CENT OF EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF EIGHTY AND ONE PER CENT OF EIGHTY 
YOU CAN THEN USE THESE ANSWERS TO WORK OUT FIFTY SIX PER CENT OF EIGHTY 
YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THIS WITHOUT USING A CALCULATOR 
TO WORK OUT FIFTY PER CENT OF EIGHTY YOU DIVIDE BY TWO 
SO FIFTY PER CENT OF EIGHTY IS FORTY 
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TWO WAYS OF GETTING FIVE PER CENT 
FIVE PER CENT EQUALS FIFTY PER CENT TEN 
SO IF FIFTY PER CENT EQUALS FORTY THEN FIVE PER CENT EQUALS FOUR 
OR YOU CAN GET TEN PER CENT OF EIGHTY WHICH IS EIGHTY TEN EQUALS EIGHT 
FIVE PER CENT IS HALF OF TEN PER CENT SO WE HAVE TO DIVIDE EIGHT BY TWO TO GET FOUR 
WHICH METHOD DID YOU PREFER 
TO GET ONE PER CENT WE HAVE TO EITHER DIVIDE TEN PER CENT BY TEN 
OR ONE HUNDRED PER CENT BY ONE HUNDRED 
WE KNOW THAT TEN PER CENT EQUALS EIGHT 
SO ONE PER CENT EQUALS EIGHT TEN WHICH EQUALS OH EIGHT 
OR WE DIVIDE EIGHTY BY ONE HUNDRED WHICH IS OH EIGHT 
WHAT ABOUT PART B. 
THERE IS A HINT IN THE QUESTION 
HOW CAN WE USE FIFTY PER CENT FIVE PER CENT AND ONE PER CENT TO GET FIFTY SIX PER CENT 
WELL FIFTY FIVE ONE EQUALS FIFTY SIX 
SO IF WE ADD THE THREE ANSWERS FROM THE FIRST PART 
WE GET THE SECOND PART 
FIFTY SIX PER CENT IS THEREFORE FORTY FOUR OH EIGHT 
WHICH IS FOUR HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT 
THIS NEXT SECTION LOOKS AT NEGATIVE NUMBERS 
IT EXPLAINS WHAT THEY MEAN AND SHOWS HOW TO WORK WITH THEM 
BUT HOW CAN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A NEGATIVE NUMBER 
WELL THIS DIVER MAY BE ABLE TO OFFER A FEW CLUES 
IN THIS DIVE HE'S CLIMBED UP TO THE BOARD WHICH IS TEN M. ABOVE THE WATER 
HE THEN DIVES DOWN UNTIL HE GETS TO APPROXIMATELY SIX M. BELOW THE WATER 
THESE DISTANCES UP AND DOWN THE BOARD CAN BE REPRESENTED 
AS NUMBERS ON A NUMBER LINE 
IF THE SURFACE OF THE WATER IS ZERO 
HE STARTS ABOVE THE DIVING BOARD AT TEN M. 
HERE HE COMES DOWN ONE M. AT A TIME 
NINE EIGHT SEVEN SIX 
FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE 
AND HOLD IT THERE 
HE'S GONE DOWN FROM TEN TO ZERO METRES 
BELOW THE SURFACE HE'S DIVING INTO NEGATIVE NUMBERS 
MINUS ONE MINUS TWO MINUS THREE MINUS FOUR 
MINUS FIVE AND MINUS SIX 
NOW HE'S GOING UP AGAIN 
BY SIX METRES BACK TO ZERO 
NUMBERS LESS THAN ZERO ARE NEGATIVE NUMBERS 
NUMBERS GREATER THAN ZERO ARE POSITIVE NUMBERS 
SO THE RULE TO REMEMBER IS AS YOU GO FURTHER UP THE NUMBER LINE 
THE NUMBERS WHETHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE GET HIGHER 
SO NEGATIVE TWO IS HIGHER OR MORE THAN NEGATIVE FIVE 
BECAUSE NEGATIVE TWO IS FURTHER UP THE NUMBER LINE 
IN THE SAME WAY POSITIVE TWO IS LOWER OR LESS THAN POSITIVE FIVE 
BECAUSE POSITIVE FIVE IS FURTHER UP THE NUMBER LINE 
BUT THE NUMBER LINE CAN BE BOTH VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL 
IF WE THINK OF THE NUMBER LINE HORIZONTALLY 
THEN THE FURTHER RIGHT WE GO THE NUMBERS 
WHETHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE GET HIGHER OR MORE THAN 
NOW ADDITION WITH NEGATIVE NUMBERS 
IS ALSO MADE EASIER BY USING A NUMBER LINE 
HERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES 
WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A NUMBER LINE 
STRETCHING FROM POSITIVE FIVE TO NEGATIVE FIVE 
WE CAN USE THIS IN ORDER TO FIND THE VALUE FOR A SIMPLE CALCULATION 
NEGATIVE TWO OR MINUS TWO FOUR 
WHAT DOES IT EQUAL 
THE FIRST THING THAT WE DO IS LOCATE MINUS TWO ON THE NUMBER LINE 
SO LET'S HIGHLIGHT THAT 
MINUS TWO IS HERE 
AND THEN WHAT WE DO IS WE MOVE UP THE NUMBER LINE 
BECAUSE WE'RE ADDING A POSITIVE VALUE 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR W. H. I. C. H. BRINGS US HERE 
SO THE ANSWER HERE 
IS NEGATIVE TWO OR MINUS TWO FOUR EQUALS TWO 
O. K. LET'S TRY ANOTHER EXAMPLE 
HERE WE CAN SEE THREE MINUS SEVEN 
WHAT DOES THAT EQUAL 
WELL THE FIRST THING THAT WE DO IS WE LOCATE THREE ON THE NUMBER LINE 
THAT'S HERE 
AND NOW WE ADD MINUS SEVEN WHICH IS THE SAME AS SUBTRACTING SEVEN 
SO WE MOVE DOWN THE NUMBER LINE 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN 
WHICH BRINGS US HERE TO MINUS FOUR 
SO THE ANSWER THEN 
IS NEGATIVE FOUR OR MINUS FOUR 
O. K. LET'S TRY ONE MORE EXAMPLE 
ONCE AGAIN THE FIRST THING WE DO 
IS LOCATE THE NUMBER ON THE NUMBER LINE 
MINUS ONE IS HERE 
WE GO UP FIVE PLUS FIVE 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE BRINGS US HERE TO FOUR 
AND THEN WE GO DOWN 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN 
BRINGS US TO MINUS THREE AND THAT IS OUR ANSWER 
ONE OF THE TIMES WHEN YOU MAY WELL COME INTO NEGATIVE NUMBERS 
IS WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH FREEZING POINTS 
WATER FREEZES INTO ICE AT ZERO DEGREES CELSIUS 
EVER TRIED FREEZING SHAMPOO 
IT FREEZES AT MINUS THREE DEGREES CELSIUS THAT'S COLDER STILL 
AND OLIVE OIL WELL THAT FREEZES AT MINUS TWELVE DEGREES CELSIUS 
THAT'S COLDER STILL 
AND NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO FREEZE SUNFLOWER OIL 
YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE IT DOWN TO MINUS SEVENTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS 
WRITE A NUMBER IN EACH BOX TO MAKE THE CALCULATIONS CORRECT 
SOMETHING SOMETHING EQUALS MINUS EIGHT 
SOMETHING SOMETHING EQUALS MINUS EIGHT 
LET'S LOOK AT THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION 
THE EASIEST WAY TO THINK OF THIS QUESTION IS TO THINK ABOUT 
TWO NEGATIVE NUMBERS THAT ADD TO MAKE NEGATIVE OR MINUS EIGHT 
SO WE COULD HAVE MINUS ONE AND MINUS SEVEN 
OR MINUS TWO AND MINUS SIX 
MINUS THREE AND MINUS FIVE AND SO ON 
A DIFFERENT WAY WOULD BE TO SKETCH A NUMBER LINE 
AND CHOOSE A NUMBER THAT IS MORE THAN MINUS EIGHT 
IF I CHOOSE SAY TWO I HAVE TO GO TEN DOWN TO REACH MINUS EIGHT 
SO I WOULD HAVE TO ADD MINUS TEN 
SO ANOTHER ANSWER WOULD BE TWO MINUS TEN 
IT'S BEST TO THINK OF THE NUMBER LINE AGAIN 
IN THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION 
IF YOU START ON FOUR YOU NEED TO GO DOWN TWELVE TO REACH MINUS EIGHT 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE AWAY BECAUSE THE QUESTION SHOWS A SUBTRACTION MARK 
TO GO DOWN THE NUMBER LINE YOU MUST SUBTRACT A POSITIVE NUMBER 
SO IN THIS EXAMPLE YOU WOULD HAVE TO SUBTRACT TWELVE 
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO FIND AS MANY CORRECT ANSWERS 
AS YOU CAN FOR THIS QUESTION AND LOOK FOR PATTERNS 
THAT'S IT FOR THIS SECTION ON NEGATIVE NUMBERS 
IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND 
JUST GO BACK AND PLAY THE PROGRAMME AGAIN 
THIS NEXT SECTION LOOKS AT WHAT IS CALLED THE UNITARY METHOD 
NOW THAT'S A VERY HANDY WAY OF WORKING OUT THE VALUE OF MANY THINGS 
BY FIRST OF ALL WORKING OUT THE VALUE OF ONE 
A SPECIAL OFFER 
THREE C. D.'S GOING FOR TWENTY ONE 
BUT I'M PLANNING TO BUY SEVERAL PACKS 
AND SELL THE C. D.'S TO MY FRIENDS 
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A PROFIT SO HOW MUCH SHOULD I CHARGE FOR EIGHT C. D.'S 
SO USING THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US THREE C. D.'S COST TWENTY ONE 
NOW THREE THREE EQUALS ONE 
AND IN THE UNITARY METHOD WE NEED TO FIND THE COST OF ONE 
COSTS TWENTY ONE THREE 
WHICH EQUALS SEVEN 
NOW WE'RE INTERESTED IN EIGHT C. D.'S 
SO 
ZERO POINT EIGHT X. SEVEN 
WHICH EQUALS FIFTY SIX 
AND THERE'S YOUR ANSWER 
HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF USING THE UNITARY METHOD 
I MUST HAVE DONE HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT ROOMS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
AND THESE JOBS ALL HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON A TIGHT BUDGET 
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON A TIGHT BUDGET 
YOU NEED AN EYE FOR A GOOD DEAL 
GETTING VALUE FOR MONEY IS SIMPLE ALL YOU NEED IS SOME MENTAL MATHS 
NOW THIS TWO FIVE HUNDRED M. L. CAN COSTS FIFTEEN 
AND THIS FIVE ZERO ZERO ZERO M. L. CAN COSTS TWENTY TWO 
WHICH ONE SHOULD I BUY 
WE MAY BE DEALING WITH BIG NUMBERS BUT DON'T REACH FOR THE CALCULATOR 
YOU JUST NEED A FEW SIMPLE MATHS STRATEGIES 
THE FIVE ZERO ZERO ZERO M. L. CAN IS EXACTLY TWICE THE SIZE OF THE TWO FIVE HUNDRED M. L. CAN 
SO ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS DOUBLE THE PRICE OF THE SMALLER CAN 
AND COMPARE THAT TO THE PRICE OF THE BIGGER CAN 
TWO X. FIFTEEN EQUALS THIRTY 
COMPARE THAT WITH THE FIVE ZERO ZERO ZERO M. L. OF TWENTY TWO THAT'S A SAVING OF EIGHT 
NOW IT'S OBVIOUS WHICH ONE I'M GONNA GO FOR IT'S THIS ONE 
SOMETIMES IT'S A CHALLENGE 
TO WORK OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S GONNA GIVE YOU THE BEST DEAL 
NEXT ON MY SHOPPING LIST ARE CORK TILES 
WHICH COME IN TWO DIFFERENT PACK SIZES' 
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS COMPARE THE PRICE OF ONE TILE FROM EACH PACK 
WELL THAT'S PRETTY EASY TO DO FOR A PACK OF SIX TILES COSTING SIX THAT'S 
ONE PER TILE NOW COMPARE THIS WITH ONE TILE FROM THE PACK OF FOUR 
THREE POINT SIX OH FOUR MIGHT SEEM A TRICKY SUM 
BUT YOU KNOW THAT FOUR X. NINE EQUALS THIRTY SIX 
SO FOUR X. NINETY P. EQUALS THREE SIXTY P. OR THREE POINT SIX OH 
THAT MEANS THREE POINT SIX OH FOUR WORKS OUT AT ZERO POINT NINE ZERO OR NINETY P. 
SO DO YOU PAY ONE FOR A TILE OR NINETY P. FOR A TILE 
WELL THE PACK OF FOUR WORKS OUT CHEAPER SO I'M GONNA HAVE THREE OF THEM 
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN GET SOME VALUE FOR MONEY 
NOW THEY SELL ONE THING HERE I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF 
I THINK I'LL TAKE FIFTY 
SHALL I GET FIVE PACKS OF TEN AT ONE PER PACK 
OR TWO PACKS OF TWENTY FIVE AT THREE A PACK 
THE PACKS OF TEN ARE TOP VALUE 
NOW LET'S SEE IF YOUR MENTAL MATHS SKILLS ARE ROCK SOLID 
WITH THIS QUICK DRYING FILLER 
SHALL I GO FOR THIS PACK OF THREE TUBES AT FIVE 
OR BUY INDIVIDUAL TUBES AT THREE EACH 
THE PACK OF THREE IS THE BETTER BARGAIN 
NOW HERE'S A HIGHLY CHARGED PROBLEM FOR YOU 
SHALL I BUY A COUPLE OF PACKS OF TWELVE AT THREE POINT FIVE OH 
OR JUST ONE PACK OF TWENTY FOUR AT SIX 
MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL SHALL I BUY SIX INDIVIDUAL TILES AT THREE 
OR GO FOR THE PACK OF SIX AT TWENTY FOUR 
YOU TELL ME 
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT ALL YOU NEED IS A FEW STRATEGIES 
SOME QUICK THINKING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET VALUE FOR MONEY 
WELL I'VE GOT EVERYTHING I NEED SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER 
SO THAT'S THE BASIS OF THE UNITARY METHOD 
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT HOLIDAYS AND MONEY 
IF WE'RE GOING ABROAD AND WE NEED TO CHANGE MONEY 
THEN WE HAVE TO USE EXCHANGE RATES 
TO SEE HOW MUCH OF ANOTHER CURRENCY WE GET IN EXCHANGE FOR OUR OWN 
RIGHT WELL I'VE JUST GOT BACK FROM THE BUREAU DE CHANGE 
WHERE I HAVE GOT NOTES FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
ALL SORTS OF SHAPES SIZES AND COLOURS 
BUT LET'S SEE WHAT THEY'RE WORTH IN CASE YOU NEED TO GO ON HOLIDAY 
STARTING AT THE TOP I'VE GOT THESE ONES 
WHICH ARE THE U. S. DOLLAR 
THEN I THOUGHT FOR A CHANGE WE'D HAVE SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
SO I'VE ACTUALLY GOT THE JAPANESE YEN 
THEN MOVING ON TO THESE AND I'VE GOT ABSOLUTELY MASSES OF THESE 
THESE ARE THE KOREAN WON 
AND FINALLY I'VE GOT THESE WHICH ARE THE INDONESIAN RUPIAH 
BUT WHAT ARE THEY ACTUALLY WORTH 
I FEEL PRETTY RICH RIGHT NOW BUT IS THAT THE CASE 
WELL STARTING OFF WITH THESE ONES THE UNITED STATES DOLLARS 
THERE ARE ABOUT SEVENTY OF THESE HERE 
AND THAT'S WORTH ABOUT THIRTY FIVE SO NOT BAD 
SO HOW DO WE GET ON WHEN WE GO TO LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR CURRENCY 
THE JAPANESE YEN 
WELL THERE ARE FOUR THOUSAND OF THESE 
STILL WORTH LESS THAN TWENTY 
THE KOREAN WON I'VE GOT A STAGGERING NINETEEN THOUSAND OF THESE 
THEY'RE WORTH LESS THAN TEN 
THEN FINALLY THE INDONESIAN RUPIAH 
I'VE GOT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THESE 
WORTH LESS THAN TWENTY 
AND THE SAD THING IS WITH JUST THAT CURRENCY 
I COULDN'T EVEN AFFORD THESE SUNGLASSES 
SO LET'S GO THROUGH CURRENCY CONVERSIONS 
IF I WANTED TO CHANGE BETWEEN POUNDS AND EUROS 
I COULD USE THE UNITARY METHOD 
WHEN YOU GO TO EUROPE MOST COUNTRIES USE EUROS 
THE EXCHANGE RATE SAYS THAT ONE 
IS WORTH ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE EUROS 
IF YOU HAD TWO THEY'D BE WORTH TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY EUROS 
AND IF YOU HAD TEN THEY WOULD BE WORTH ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EUROS 
TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH YOUR POUNDS ARE WORTH IN EUROS 
YOU HAVE TO MULTIPLY BY THE EXCHANGE RATE 
IF YOU TOOK THREE HUNDRED TO CHANGE INTO EUROS HOW MUCH WOULD YOU GET 
USING YOUR CALCULATOR 
MULTIPLY THE POUNDS BY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED FIVE EUROS 
EXCHANGE RATES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT 
WHEN YOU WANT TO WORK OUT THE PRICE OF SOMETHING IN POUNDS 
WHEN YOU'RE ABROAD 
TO CHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY BACK INTO POUNDS 
YOU HAVE TO DIVIDE BY THE EXCHANGE RATE 
BECAUSE DIVIDING IS THE OPPOSITE OF MULTIPLYING 
SO TO CHANGE EUROS INTO POUNDS WE D. I. V. I. D. E. B. Y. ONE THIRTY FIVE 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SEE A JACKET ON SALE IN FRANCE FOR SEVENTY EUROS 
HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST YOU IN POUNDS 
WE HAVE TO ROUND TO TWO DECIMAL PLACES WHEN WE DEAL WITH MONEY 
SO THE PRICE IN POUNDS IS FIFTY ONE POINT EIGHT FIVE 
PART A USE ONE EQUALS SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN RUPEES 
TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH FORTY FIVE P. IS IN RUPEES 
AND REMEMBER TO SHOW YOUR WORKINGS 
PART B. USE TWO HUNDRED JAPANESE YEN EQUALS ONE 
TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT YEN IS IN POUNDS 
SHOW YOUR WORKINGS 
LET'S WORK THROUGH THE QUESTION ONE PART AT A TIME 
WE HAVE TO ROUND UP TO TWO DECIMAL PLACES 
THAT LOOKS SENSIBLE 
BECAUSE ZERO POINT FOUR FIVE IS ROUGHLY HALF OF ONE 
AND YOU WOULD EXPECT THE AMOUNT IN RUPEES 
TO BE ROUGHLY HALF OF SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN RUPEES 
PART B. SAYS USE TWO HUNDRED TEN JAPANESE YEN TO ONE 
TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT YEN IS IN POUNDS 
AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW YOUR WORKINGS 
TO CONVERT BACK INTO POUNDS WE NEED TO DIVIDE BY TWO HUNDRED TEN 
ROUNDING DOWN TO TWO DECIMAL PLACES
