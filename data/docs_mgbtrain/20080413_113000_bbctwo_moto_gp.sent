ROUND THREE AND THE OTHER TWO 
ROUNDS HAVE BEEN CRACKERS WE CAN 
LOOK BACK TO THE LAST RACE THE 
LAST CLUB WAS A CORKER IT HAS BEEN 
TALKED ABOUT A LOT LAST UP THIS 
WAS BILLED AS A SPANISH JAIL 
FIGHT ALL GLORY WENT TO PEDROSA 
OF COURSE IT IS LEDS WE STILL HAVE 
SIXTEEN RACES TO GO EARLY DAYS ONE 
PERSON HAS HAD THREE PODIUM TWO 
PODIUM FINISHES OFFER THIS AREA HE 
FANCIES HIS CHANCES HE IS HERE TO 
STAY STAY LORENZO NATURAL BORN ENTERTAINER 
OR EGO MANIAC THE SPANISH 
SENSATION SHOWS AN EXTRAORDINARY 
TALENT FOR WRITING A MOTORCYCLE HE 
BEGAN AT THE EIGHTEENTH ON THE BIKE MADE 
BY HIS FATHER HE IS A DOUBLE WORLD 
CHAMPION AND HAS JUST PUBLISHED HIS 
OWN BOOK HE HAS MOVED TO LONDON TO 
LEARN ENGLISH HE LOVES NOTHING 
MORE THAN GIVING IN THE SUNLIGHT 
P. C.'S AND THERE WAS SO MUCH TOP SO 
MANY HEADLINES COME ABOUT YOU AND 
VALENTINO BUT FROM THE OUTSET THE 
KING AND IT LOOKS AS IF YOU HAVE 
MORE OF A PROBLEM WITH PEDROSA AND 
ALSO IN YOUR BOOK YOU SAID THAT 
PEDROSA WAS A GOOD PERSON YES YES THIS IS MY OPINION A LOT OF PEOPLE 
THINK THAT PEDROSA IS FANTASTIC 
FAR ME I HE IS VERY FAST BUT MY 
OPINION HIS ATTITUDE COME AFTER 
THE RACE 
YOU'RE DESCRIBED AS 
GREGARIOUS BALD A BIG CHARACTER 
BOLD HERE ARE SOME PICTURES FROM 
YOUR BOOK YOU'RE NOT WEARING A LOT 
OF CLOTHES IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE 
SEE A LOT YOU TAKING OFF YOUR TOP 
I AM SATISFIED WITH MY BODY WHEN I 
AM HOT I TAKE MY T. SHIRT OFF 
A ONE 
TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS OTHER PICTURE 
I WON'T HAVE UP I WANT TO ASK 
YOU WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 
THIS 
IN THAT TIME OF MY LIFE I WAS THIS VERY COVERED TO MY PERSONALITY MY 
PERSONALITY WAS NOT COMPLETELY I 
WAS NOT MYSELF AT THAT TIME OF MY 
LIFE 
WHAT WAS STOPPING YOU BEING LIFE OPEN QUESTION THERE WAS AT YOUR 
AGE SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING MAYBE MAYBE MY PROBLEM WITH MY FATHER IT WAS 
NOT GOOD FOR MY BRAIN THERE WAS A 
PERIOD OF MY LIFE BUT I REMEMBER 
VERY CLEAN IT WAS NOT GOOD FOR ME 
DID SOMETHING HAPPENED TO CHANGE 
THE RELATIONSHIP 
YES MY FATHER 
WHEN HE HAS AN IDEA IN HIS MIND HE 
DOES NOT CARE ABOUT IDEAS FROM 
OTHER PEOPLE YOU WANT TO GROW UP 
AND BE INDEPENDENT AND YOUR DAD IS 
SAYING TO YOU DON'T DO THAT YEARS 
LATER GOT FOR ME HE IS LIKE THAT 
GOD 
WITH ALL THE HARD WORK GOD THE GOD RACING IS THERE ANY ROOM IN YOUR 
LIFE THAN ANY LADIES 
YES SURE L. 
LIKE WOMEN VERY MUCH TOO MUCH 
HAVE YOU FOUND ANYONE IN LONDON 
YES TWO OF THEM 
THE BUSY LIVES 
WHAT I DO SEE A LITTLE LAUGH 
FANTASTIC QUITE BRILLIANT HE IS 
SHAKING THE PADDOCK UP I DO NOT 
THINK THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH 
THAT YESTERDAY HE WAS SO PAIR IN 
QUALIFYING THOSE LAPS WERE 
OUTSTANDING 
YES HE SAID POLE OUTSTANDING POSITION COME ABOUT 
SECONDS AGO 
HE TOOK HIS SEAT HERE IN THE 
GALLERY BEHIND ME FIRST OF ALL 
SECRET HE GOT HELD UP BY 
VERMEULEN THEN HE PULLED IT BACK 
HE FOLLOWED IT UP WITH TO RECORD 
POULT LAPS TWO RECORD LAPS CAN SEE 
WORLD CHAMPION 
VOTIVE THAT HE HAS NEVER REALLY 
BEEN A FAN OF LORENZO THOUGHT OF 
THAT FIRST SUB THE NEWCOMERS MAKING 
MORE ENEMIES THAN FRIENDS 
FANTASTIC NEWS FOR JAMES COME AT 
TECH THREE YAMAHA HAVE SIGNED A NEW 
CONTRACT THEY HAVE TAKEN UP AN 
OPTION ON JAMES FOR NEXT YEAR 
TOSELAND WILL BE RIDING IN MOTOGP 
OF WITH TECH THREE YAMAHA ONCE AGAIN 
WE SAID WE WOULD STAY WITH THIS 
STORY WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
THIS PNEUMATIC VALVE ENGINE 
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WHERE ARE TOLD 
THAT YOU USED TO PESTER YOUR MUM 
AND DAD THE FACTORY BOYS GET ALL 
THE GOOD STUFF IN MOTOGP WHILE THE 
SATURDAY SATELLITE KIDS DOWN THE 
ROAD HAVE TO PESTER THEIR TEAM FOR 
HAND ME DOWNS THIS WEEKEND GHANA 
HAVE DELIVERED IN THE SHAPE OFF TO 
BRAND SPANKING NEMATIC VENGEANCE 
NEMATIC INDIAN'S 
PNEUMATIC ENGINES 
IT HAS MORE 
ACCELERATION FULL WAS 
APPREHENSIVE ABOUT WHAT A 
DIFFERENCE WAS GOING TO BE L. WAS SURPRISED 
BOTH RIDERS AWAY OVER SURPRISED THE MOON THEY HAVE SAID THEY ARE 
IN LOVE WITH THAT ENGINE THIS IS 
EASIER TO HANDLE AND FASTER 
THE 
THE ENGINE SHOULD GIVE THE TECH THREE 
YAMAHA BIKES MORE SPEED AND BETTER 
FUEL ECONOMY IT PROVES YAMAHA'S 
COMMITMENT IT IS A BIG THANK YOU 
TO YAMAL HAD TO SUPPORT THEIR FOUR 
RIDER'S THIS IS WHY I SIGNED FOR 
THIS TECH THREE YAMAHA TEAM 
THE PUSH 
HARDER I THINK IF YOU WERE ONE 
SECOND QUICKER I THINK THERE IS 
HAVE A SECOND HERE AND HALF A 
SECOND IN THE ENGINE 
THIS PACKAGE 
IS CAPABLE OF FINISHING ON THE 
PODIUM IT IS NICE TO KNOW THAT I 
AM IN A TEAM AND IT ABOUT THAT IS 
CAPABLE OF BEING ON THE PODIUM 
THAT IS MOUTH WATERING PROSPECT 
TOSELAND ON THE PODIUM WHAT IS THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND 
PNEUMATIC VALVE AND A SPRING VALVE 
IT PILLS THE VALVE BACK INTO ITS 
SEAT WITH A SPRING BUT THE PROBLEM 
IS THAT WHEN YOU GET UP TO HIGHER 
REVS IT GETS CONFUSED THEN YOU 
CAN GET THEIR PNEUMATIC SYSTEM 
THAT ACTUALLY ACTS AS ASPIRIN AND 
DRAWS THE VAST BACK UP INSIDE IT 
IS MORE EXPENSIVE TO MAKE IT 
ALLOWS THEM TO HOLD THE GEARS FOR 
LONGER IN GET MORE POWER IT IS 
MORE FUEL EFFICIENT 
THEY HAVE 
NOTED THE FOUR PER CENT DIFFERENCE IN FUEL 
EFFICIENCY THIS WEEKEND WHICH IS 
MASSIVE 
IT IS NOT ABOUT SAVING MASSIVE MONEY ON GAS THEY CAN PUT MORE 
INTO THE ENGINE TO GIVE THEM MORE 
POWERFUL STUFF IT HELPS HIM ALL THE 
WAY THROUGH 
HE HAS DONE A GREAT 
JOB WE HAVE ENJOYED WATCHING HIM 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CONTROVERSY 
LOOKING AT THE MOVE ON LORENZO 
LORENZA DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THE IDEA OF A 
RACE IS TO WIN I THINK IT WAS FINE 
THERE IS AN EXPRESSION ABOUT 
STANDING SOMEONE UP THEY HAVE TO 
STAND UP AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED 
THERE WAS A BIT OF CONTACT WHICH HE 
WAS NOT AIMING AT IT WAS ABOUT 
TRYING TO POSITION YOURSELF AS SOME 
IF YOU CAN GET THE BIKE ON THE 
INSIDE DO SO 
IF HE SEES A GAP HE 
IS GOING TO GO FOR IT THEY WERE 
CRACKING OVERTAKING MANOEUVRES HE HE WAS HALF ASLEEP JAMES GOT DOWN THE 
INSIDE IT WAS ONE OF THOSE CORNERS 
THAT YOU START WADING IN THE WAY 
WIDE ANYWAY 
YESTERDAY HE HAD A BIT 
OF A RUN IN WITH HE DONE BECAUSE HE 
FELT HE'D IN HE WENT BACK AND 
APOLOGISED HE SAID HE WAS SORRY 
AND HE DID NOT MEAN TO BE RUDE AS 
HE WAS JUST UPSET 
THEY GET TANGLED UP DIMS IS BLOTTO 
AT LEARNING AT THE CIRCUIT THAT'S 
THE LAST TIME I DO THAT FOR YOU 
NICE PLUMP ARE YOU HAVE GOT THERE 
GUYS PUMPED WE NEVER SEE IT ALL 
DEEP DUCATI ON THE GRID WHY IS IT 
THAT BONNY CASEY STONER SEEMS TO BE 
ABLE TO GET THAT BEAST AROUND THE 
TRACKS THAT ONLY CASEY STONER 
IT HAS BEEN A MIX START TO THE 
SEASON FOR DUCATI WHAT A 
NIGHTMARE BUT THEY ALL THOUGHT 
THEIR CHRISTMASES HAD COME AT ONCE 
WHEN THEY GOT THEIR HANDS ON A 
DUCATI BUT WHEN THEY GOT THEM ON 
THAT THEY WERE NOT WHAT THEY WERE 
EXPECTING ESPECIALLY FOR MARCO 
MELANDRI BUT EVEN THE TEAM ARE 
CONFUSED TO WHAT IS GOING ON 
IF WE 
KNEW THE PROBLEM WE WOULD SOLVE IT 
IT IS NOT THAT EASY TO UNDERSTAND 
THE BIKES CHARACTERISTICS SUIT 
PERFECTLY CASEY STONER'S STYLE THE THE BIKE IS RIDEABLE IT IS NOT SUCH A 
DISASTER THAT SOME OF THE RIDERS 
ARE MAKING IT LOOK L. THINK THEY 
NEED TO CHANGE THEIR STYLE AND 
MENTALITY IT A BIT L. L. THINK THERE 
WERE EXPECTING TO JUMP ON IT AND IT 
TO BE A WORLD BEATER MAYBE IT HAS 
SHOCKED THEM A BIT AND THEY NEED 
TO TAKE SOME MORE TIME TO BE MORE 
AGGRESSIVE WITH IT 
NOT A LOT OF 
SYMPATHY FROM THE WORLD CHAMPION 
PULLS JOB WHY SHOULD THERE BE BUT 
THAT IS NOT COME BUT THAT IS NO 
COMFORT FOR MARCO MELANDRI 
IF I 
HAVE THE CONFIDENCE I CANNOT DRIVE 
I THOUGHT THAT IF I WAS WORKING 
HARD I COULD PLAY RACE BY RACE 
ARE GOING AROUND AND THERE 
IS A PROBLEM IT IS NOT EASY 
AT THE 
MOMENT WE WILL KEEP WORKING HARD 
AND WE WILL FIND A SOLUTION TO 
HOWEVER HE IS NOT ON HIS OWN 
SYLVAIN GUINTOLI AND TONI ELIAS I 
STILL AT A LOSS TOO 
IT IS A BIKE 
THAT I CANNOT ADOPT TO MY RIDING 
STYLE OR ANYONE'S EXCEPT FOR CASEY 
STONER 
K. C. STONOR FEELS GOOD FOR STONER IT CASEY STONER FEELS GOOD WITH 
THIS BIKE BUT WE DO NOT FEEL GOOD 
THERE IS NO REAL SECRET IT IS 
STILL GOT TWO WHEELS BREAK AND 
THROTTLE IT IS THE SAME AS ANOTHER 
MOTORCYCLE THERE ARE ALL THE SMALL 
THINGS HERE AND THERE YOU NEED TO 
CHANGE 
THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF CHANGE SYMPATHY FROM CUP ROSSI FROM 
LORIS CAPIROSSI HAS HE TRIED TO 
TO YOU ABOUT IT 
YES HE HAS COME 
BUT HE HITS HE HAS COME A LOT BUT 
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SAY ON CAMERA 
WHAT HE ASKED 
IF THERE WAS AN 
ANSWER THE TEAMS WOULD HAVE SORTED 
IT OUT WE KNOW THAT MARCO MELANDRI 
NEEDS TO REBUILD HIS CONFERENCE 
CONFIDENCE AND THE OTHERS WANT TO 
CHANGE THEIR STYLE IT IS FINDING 
THE KEY TO UNLOCK IT EVEN CASEY 
STONER IS MISSING THAT KEY THIS 
WEEKEND 
A VERY CONDUCTED IS THE WEEKEND BARRIER OF WE HAVE GOT A COUPLE OF 
DE TATTIES HERE DUCATI HERE IT 
WAS A QUALIFYING SESSION TO FORGET 
FOR THE WORLD CHAMPION AS WELL AS 
A SET TO WITH LORENZO 
CASEY STONER NEVER REALLY CRACKED 
THE SET UP HE WAS LOOKING FOR HE 
DID WELL TO MAKE IT TO THE THIRD 
RAW HIS SPARRING PARTNER HAD NO 
SUCH ISSUES AND HE HAD NO SUCH 
ISSUES JAMES TOSELAND AND COLIN 
EDWARDS BOTH MADE THE SECOND ROW 
GREAT STUFF FROM A JAMES AS THE 
SESSION MOVED ON LORIS CAPIROSSI 
HAD A CRASH INTO THE TARMAC IT WAS 
ALL SMILES FOR THE HONDA'S AND IT 
WAS SECOND FASTEST FOR DANI PEDROSA 
LAST YEAR'S WINNER VALENTINO ROSSI 
HAS CAUGHT HIM SO HAS CAUGHT HIS 
WAY UP TO THE FIRST FUND FRONT 
ROW START OF THE YEAR JORGE 
LORENZO GOT HIS THIRD SUCCESSIVE 
POLE POSITION CAN HE CONVERTED TO 
A WINTER DAY CAN HE INDEED HERE 
ON THE THIRD ROLE IS CASEY STONER 
THIS IS HIS WORST QUALIFYING ON 
THAT TO BE CATTY BIKE DUCATI 
BIKES NOT THE SMOOTHEST OF 
WEEKENDS FOR CASEY STONER LET'S 
STAY HERE WITH HIM HE HAS HAD A 
DIFFICULT TIME THIS WEIRD FRONT 
END CRASH HE LOST THE FUND THEIR 
AND HE HAS LOST CONFIDENCE WITH THE 
FUNDER THAT BIKE THEN HE HAD 
HERE ARE THE NEXT SHOT HE HAS BEEN 
QUITE FURIOUS WITH HIMSELF AND THE 
TEAM HE IS REALLY REALLY ANGRY 
THEIR AFTER QUALIFYING YESTERDAY 
HE DID GO INTO HIS GARAGE AND 
PATTED ALL THE MECHANICS ON THE 
BACK HE SAID LET'S ALL PULLED 
TOGETHER TOMORROW HE CHANGED HIS 
WAY AND THIS MORNING HE WAS 
FASTEST IN THE TRICKY CONDITIONS 
SO THINGS MIGHT BE CHANGING NEXT 
TO HIM HIS RANDY IS RANDY DE 
PUNIET HE PUT HIS HAND OUT L. AM 
OFF SORRY ABOUT THAT JUST WATCH 
THIS LOTS AND LOTS OF DAMAGE FOR 
THE HONDA LET'S JUST REMIND US OF

GIVING ME THIS ENGINE IT IS MUCH 
STRONGER AND THE BIKE IS CAPABLE

HAS INSPIRED DOODLES 
SIX S. AND 
HIS CHARACTER SUCCESS AND HIS 
CHARACTERS I HAVE GOT TO KNOW HIM

OURS WAS TIGER WOODS WE ARE ON A 
HIGH LEVEL AND WE GET AND WE GET 
ON AUTOMATIC BE 
TWO DO GET MUCH 
TIME TO WATCH BIKE RACING QUESTION 
BACK WE GET TO SEE HIM A LOT AT 
TOURNAMENTS 
WE WATCH IT A GROUP TOURNAMENTS OF GUYS IN THE LOCKER ROOM 
I HOPE 
THE FRENCH OPEN GOES AWAY THIS YEAR 
LET'S HAVE ALWAYS ALONG THE FRONT 
VALENTINO ROSSI IS ON THE FRONT 
FANTASTIC RECORD FOR VALENTINO IT 
RAISES EIGHT PODIUMS FIVE WINS 
EIGHT RACES HE IS ON THE FRONT ROW 
HE IS TAKING NO PRISONERS ROUND 
HERE THESE ARE THE SPANIARDS 
AGAIN ON THE FRONT ROW DANI 
PEDROSA LOOKING FOR A BACK TO BACK 
WIN VOTES UP AND IN POLE POSITION 
JUST EXTRAORDINARY JORGE LORENZO 
HE JUST WINKED AT ME CHEEKY DEVIL 
HE IS A FANTASTIC RIDER HE WILL BE 
THE YOUNGEST EVER TO TAKE THREE 
SUCCESSIVE PODIUMS IF HE GETS ON 
THE PODIUM HE WOULD TAKE THE 
RECORD FROM DANI PEDROSA IS SO 
IF SO WE ARE ON BOARD WERE THE 
COLIN EDWARDS WITH IS A QUICK 
FLICK TO THE LEFT HAND SIDE THIS 
NEW ENGINE REVS A LOT MORE BACK TO 
FIRST GEAR BECAUSE IT IS A STEEP 
CLIMB OUT OF HERE LOOKING FOR ALL 
THE GRIP YOU CAN FOR THE LONGER 
LEFT HANDER HERE AT TURNER FOUR 
TERM FOR COLONEL FOUR 
IT IS VERY EASY TO A OUTBREAK 
YOURSELF FOR THIS TURN UP SIX 
THIS CIRCUIT HAS THE SLOWEST 
AVERAGE SPEED OF ANY GO WRONG PRIX 
CIRCUIT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 
GRAND PRIX IT'S ANOTHER TURN RIGHT 
BEFORE WE COME TO THE SLOWEST 
CORNER OF ANY OF THE KORAN PRIX 
CIRCUITS FROM THREE GRAND 
BRICKS 
CONSTANT THROTTLE THERE IS THE 
EXIT AND ON THE POWERFUL STOP THE 
MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE CIRCUIT 
NICKY HAYDEN HAS THE LAP RECORD 
EXCITING STUFF YOU CAN SEE THE PIT 
LANE FILLING UP WITH THE MECHANICS 
PREPARING THE SECOND BIKES JUST IN 
CASE IT RAINS THAT'S A LOOK AT THE 
FRONT ROW OF THE GRID JORGE 
LORENZO ABSOLUTES AND SATAN SO FAR 
DANI PEDROSA AIR ALSO LEADING THE 
STANDING VALENTINO ROSSI ALSO 
THEN IT IS THE TOOK TECH THREE YAMAHA 
BOYS OF COLIN EDWARDS AND JAMES 
TOSELAND TWO 
I AM A LITTLE BIT 
WORRIED ABOUT JORGE LORENZO'S START 
IF YOU KEEP THIRTY WITH THEM LIKE THAT 
THE FLIRTING WAS THE OTHER WAY 
ROUND 
HE WILL NEED ALL HIS ROUND TRACTION CONTROL ROUND I COULD DO WITH A 
FEW TIPS FROM ROGER FEDERER STEVE STEVE HAS SO MANY GUESTS HE HAS TO SHARE 
AROUND SO MANY DEATHS SO ALL 
LITTLE TIME GIFTS FALSE START 
DRIFTS SO MANY GIFTS SO LITTLE 
TIME THESE BIG BIKES PRODUCING HUGE 
AMOUNTS OF HORSEPOWER 
WE SAW SOME 
SPOTS OF RAIN 
THERE COULD BE A 
QUICK SHOWER HERE IT BECOMES 
MENTAL RAIN WHEN YOU ARE ON A BIKE 
YOU GET SO MANY SPOTS ON YOUR VISOR 
THAT IT SKIERS ARE THE LIVING 
DAYLIGHTS OUT OF YOU SCARES 
VERY TRICKY CONDITIONS 
THE TRACK 
TEMPERATURES ARE NOT HIGH IDYLLIC IDYLLIC AT THESE BIKES YOU WILL SEE THAT 
PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THEM HAVE GOT 
SOME TAPE ARE TRYING TO KEEP THE 
TEMPERATURE UP IF YOU LOOK AT 
THESE BIKES THE WAY OF KEEPING THE 
TENTH DUP IS SOME TAKE ON THE 
RADIATOR 
YOU ARE LOOKING AT THESE RADIATOR LOWER SCOTS FLOWERS ANYWHERE 
SLOWEST CORNER ANYWHERE THE TRACTION CONTROL IS WORKER OVER 
TIME WORKING 
BEING A SPORTSMAN 
TIME WORKING BEING A SPORTSMAN YOU PROBABLY OF A DECLINE AS 
OVERDID THINGS 
THREE BALL 
OVERDID THINGS THREE BALL POSITIONS IN A ROW FOR IT LORENZO 
PAUL POSITIONS WARRENS HAS STALLED THE GUYS AT 
THE FRONT WILL NOT BE PLEASED WITH 
THIS WE'RE GETTING READY PRETTY GOOD START THEIR BUYER ROSSI 
NOT A BAD START FOR LORENZO GREAT 
STUFF BY THE HONDA MAN ROSSI HAS 
GONE WITH HIM AS WELL CAN HE HOLED 
OUT DE ROSSI NO HOW SLIPPERY IS IT MY GUYS ARE 
TRYING TO FILL THEIR WHERE RENT A 
FEEL THEIR WAY ROUND 
DOVIZIOSO 
DOVIZIOSO IS UP INTO THIRD LORENZO SLAMS THE 
DOOR SHUT A MAJOR MOMENT FOR 
PEDROSA HE IS GOING BACKWARDS 
LORENZO PUSHING IN THESE TRICKY 
CONDITIONS HE IS THE GUY GETTING 
TO THE TRACK FIRST POST EVERYONE 
ELSE CAN WATCH WHAT HE IS DOING 
THEY HAVE GOT THE CARBON BRAKES AND 
EVERYTHING ON AT THE MOMENT ROUND 
THIS LONG CORNER FOR THE FIRST TIME ROSSI GETTING FORCED WAIT WIDE 
THERE WAS AND JUST FLYING 
EVERYWHERE BUT THE LORENZO IS NOW 
IN FRONT LORENZA OFF LORENZO 
SECOND TIME AROUND THEY ARE GOING 
TO GET A THRILL OF THE CROWD YES YES AND IT LOOKS AS IF THE RAIN IS 
GOING ON GOING OFF THOSE SOME 
THERE IS A FLAG UP PERHAPS IT IS 
RAINING EVEN MORE DOWN THE INSIDE FROM ROSSI AT THAT TURN ROSSOUW LEAD THE WAY HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING DE ROSSI LEEDS THERE ARE STILL SPOT OF RAIN WAVES OF WHITE FLAGS BEING WAVED PEDROSA DEBT FIGURE EIGHT SWING SHOT GETS 
A GREAT HE CANNOT AFFORD FOR ROSSI TO MAKE A BREAK HERE 
THIS IS SOME OFF 
A BREAK HERE THIS IS SOME WAY OFF THE PACE WE KNOW THEY CAN DO IF THE 
CONDITIONS ARE PERFECT YAMAHA 
FIRST AND SECOND 
BIKES ARE BEING 
READIED THIS IS LORENZO'S THEIR 
BAKED GETTING READY IN CASE HE 
COMES IN SPARE BIKE HOPKINS HOPKINS MADE A GREAT START THAT WAS SUCH A BIG SHOVEL INTO THE FIRST COUPLE OF CORNERS SHUFFLE ROSSI IT THOUGHT THAT HE HAD A GOOD 
RACE SET UP ROSSI THOUGHT THIS THIS IS THE BATTLE OF THE SPAN 
SPANIARDS PEDROSA AND LORENZO A 
BIT OF A DRESS REHEARSAL BY PEDROSA 
WE KNOW THE HONDA IS NOT THE 
FASTEST BUT THEY HAVE A NEW ENGINE 
COMING IN THE SLIPSTREAM OF THE 
HONDA WAS FAST ONCE HE GOT SIDE BY 
SIDE HE DID NOT HAVE A HORSE POWER 
THAT IS WHAT THE NICKY HAYDEN HAS 
BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT NICKY 
HAYDEN IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE PEDROSA IS 
BEING HELD UP AT THE MOMENT WAS HE 
IS PROBABLY THE FASTEST GUY ON THE 
TRACK THOSE WHITE FLAGS WOULD BE 
QUITE DISTRACTING I THINK IT MEANS 
THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO MAKE CHOICE 
AS TO COME IN AND CHANGE THEIR 
BREAK BIKE IN SOME WAYS 
THE WHITE FLAG BEING RAISED WOULD 
MAKE YOU CONSIDER HOW DO WET IT IS 
OUT THEIR A LOT OF IT IS HIS BODY MASS SIZE 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH BEING A 
RIDER BEING AT LATER BEING 
LIGHTER IS HE DOES NOT IS HE DOES 
NOT HAVE AS MUCH VIOLENCE 
BALANCE 
THIS IS A VERY DEMANDING CIRCUIT ROSSI FIVE TIMES WORLD CHAMPION THIS WAS THEIR PNEUMATIC ENGINE WE SPOKE ABOUT AREA 
EARLIER HOPKINS HANGING IN THEIR WEALTH US IN THERE WELL A LOT OF TIME 
DURING TESTING BUT DOES SO BROKE 
HIS WRIST HOPKINS STRAINED A GROIN 
MUSCLE PEDROSA STONER HAS NOT COME TO JOIN THIS 
FRONT GRIP YET GROUP IN A 
GROUP OF ABOUT SIX SECONDS BACK HE HE HAS HAD A TOUGH WEEKEND 
HE WAS ON 
THE MONEY IN THE WARM UP HE IS 
ABSOLUTELY NOT IN THE HUNT HERE 
SEEMING TO BE TAKING A MATURE 
ATTITUDE PATTING THE GUYS ON THE 
BACK IN THE GARAGE YESTERDAY 
HE IS RUNNING WAIT TOO HOT THAT IS 
NO FUN WHATSOEVER COMING DOWN ON 
YOUR VISOR I YOU'RE NEVER SURE HOW 
MUCH IT IS TRAINING RAINING YOU'RE LOOKING FAR OF MAXIMUM GRIP 
ON THESE TYRES F. A. MAXIMUM DEPTH 
WILL SOME ARE IS ROSSI BEING 
OPTIMISTIC 
NORMALLY IT IS NOT A OPTIMISTIC GAME PLAN HE RUNS IN COME ANOTHER 
HEAVE BEHIND SENT OUT THAT WAS IN THE DAYS WHEN HE HAD 
NOT HAD SIX RACES WITHOUT A WIN HE 
IS AS DESPERATE AS ANYBODY YET THEY 
ARE NOW A HE HAS NEVER GONE SO 
LONG WITHOUT A WIN TOSELAND ON THE INSIDE RIGHT BEHIND STONER THE SUZUKI IS TURNING WELL THEY ARE HAVE IT OUT THOSE THREE 
THAT 
IS MORE RAIN ON THE SCREEN IS THREATENING THE JUST SITTING 
WATCHING IT FRIGHTENING ME 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE DELIGHTED WITH 
HOW HE IS RUNNING 
A GREAT START TO 
THE RACE THOUGHT JOHN FOR JOHN 
YES HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A GOOD 
RACE 
HOW DIFFICULT IS IT FOR THE RACE RACE PREPARING FOR THESE 
CONDITIONS 
IT IS O. K. IT WAS CONDITIONS LOOKING LIKE HEAVY RAIN BEFORE THE 
START OF THE RACE NOW WE'RE 
PREPARED IF WE HAVE TO CHANGE WE 
WILL CHANGE THEY WILL 
A 
WILL CHANGE COUPLE OF ROUNDS GUMMER DOES HE 
HAVE THE FITNESS TO GALWAY 
HE IS 
FIT AGAIN SO HE CAN MAKE IT 
ALL 
THE WAY OF PEDROSA DOES NOT LIKE THIS TAPE 
OF CONDITION TYPE IS 
BEING RISKY WE WILL SEE IF IT PAYS 
OFF ROSSI JUST TOUCHING THOSE WHITE 
LINES AFFAIR IS A SHOWER OF THOSE 
WHITE LINES WILL BE TREACHEROUS 
IF THERE IS GOOD PASS IT 
IS ALL GOING ON IT IS GOING OFF FIRST ON A FOR STONER NICKY HAYDEN THE MAN IN THE CENTRE 
OF YOUR PICTURE HAS BITTEN THE 
FASTEST LAP PUT IN HE IS THE 
LAP RECORD HOLDER FROM LAST YEAR VERY VERY CLOSE INDEED YOU CAN JUST SEE THAT LAST GRAPHIC 
SHOWING THE GAP GETTING SMALLER OF 
I AM SURE DANI PEDROSA IS THE 
QUICKEST GUY ON THIS TRACK THE 
HONDA DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE 
POWER STILL NO SPOTS OF RAIN L. 
SAID ALL LONG DANI PEDROSA SEEMS 
MORE PURPOSEFUL HE IS LEADING AT 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP IN THE POINTS 
SITUATION HE IS SITTING ON A FORTY ONE 
JORGE LORENZO IS ON THIRTY SIX JORGE LORENZO A TINY BIT HOT ON 
THE BRAKES CASEY STONER AT THE 
REIGNING WORLD CHAMPION IS 
STORMING TO THE BACK OF THE GRID 
HE WILL BE SO ANGRY IN THAT HELMET 
HAS HE GOT TYRE PROBLEMS ALREADY 
ALL WEEKEND THAT BIKE HAS LOOKED AT 
TO BE IT JUST HASN'T WORKED IT IS 
TRYING TO KEEP HIM OFF THE BIKE IN 
THE PAST HE HAS HANDLED THAT 
SOME VIGOUR HAS FALLEN OFF THAT 
THAT LOOKS LIKE AN ELECTRONIC 
COMPONENT HE HAS GRAB THAT AND PUT 
IT BACK IN THEY COULD MEAN THAT 
ONE OF THE ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS IS 
NOT WORKING IT COULD BE TO DO WITH 
THE LOGGING SYSTEM THAT IS THE 
LAST THING YOU NEED TO BE DOING AT 
TWO HUNDRED M. P. H. SO VALENTINO ROSSI THE 
MAN WHO HAS NEVER NOT BEEN ON THE 
PODIUM HE HAS HAD FIVE WINS HERE 
AT ESTORIL YOUR FIRST THREE ROSSI 
JORGE LORENZO 
DANI PEDROSA UP DANI PEDROSA IS JUST CHALLENGING JORGE LORENZO REALLY FIGHTING BACK DANI PEDROSA OR IT BUT ROSE IS 
THROUGH DANI PEDROSA IS THROUGH 
NOW WE ARE GOING TO SEE WHAT HE IS 
REALLY MADE OFF WE WILL SEE IF HE 
CAN CHALLENGE THIS L. HAD HIM DOWN 
AS THE WINNER TODAY HE LOOKS FAST 
AND SMOOTH HE COULD GET BLASTED 
DOWN THE STREET IF HE GETS TO THE 
FUND WE WILL SEE EVERY JORGE 
LORENZO OF HAS GOT IT IF HE GETS 
TO THE FRONT LOOK AT THAT A 
PERFECT POSITION EASY TO COVER HERE AND NO WAY 
AROUND THE REALLY CRITICAL PART IS 
THE TWO CORNERS FROM THIS WE'LL WE'LL RUN TO THIRTEEN VALENTINO ROSSI IS SO 
GOOD RUN THIS ROUNDERS 
ROUND AT THIS CORNER DANI PEDROSA 
IS IN THE SLIPSTREAM THERE JORGE 
LORENZO COULD NOT REALLY DO 
ANYTHING ABOUT DANI PEDROSA 
PREVENT THAT ACTUALLY JORGE LORENZO 
IS GETTING OFF THE CORNER REALLY 
WELL THE TIMES ARE THE PEOPLE THAT 
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET IT OFF THE 
CORNER 
NICKY HAYDEN HAS GOT CORNER HIMSELF PAST COLIN EDWARD EXPECT 
HIM TO START CLOSING THESE GUYS UP 
THERE IS THE FOUR JAMES IS SITTING 
IN NINTH POSITION CASEY STONER IS 
BACK TO ELEVENTH WHEN YOU ARE TO BE A 
MICHELIN AGAINST A BRIDGESTONE IT 
MEANS NOTHING BUT IT MEANS A LOT 
ON THE TRACK WE HAVE A BRIDGESTONE 
LEADING AND A MICHELIN SECOND AND 
THIRD THEY ALSO IN FORCE AS WELL 
THEY ARE MICHELIN SLIPS ON THE 
FRONT THEY COULD MEAN THAT ANDREA 
DOVIZIOSO HAS A BIT MORE TRACTION 
HE IS IN FRONT OF ONE OF THE 
HONDA'S STILL A BIT OF MENACING 
RAIN THERE NOT ENOUGH TO DO ANY 
REAL HARM WHEN YOU ARE READY IN 
THESE CONDITIONS YOU WANT TO STOP 
THE BIKE LOOK AT THE TRACK AND 
SET OFF AGAIN OF 
LOOK AT THIS 
DOWN THE INSIDE DANI PEDROSA SLAMS 
THE DOOR SHUT CAN'T HOLD HIM OFF 
LORENZO IS THROUGH THEIR 
THE OR 
MAKE HIM VERY VERY CROSS THAT 
WILL MAKE HIM VERY CROSS THAT'S WHAT WE SAY ABOUT DANI 
PEDROSA JUST A BIT SOFT ON THE 
BRAKING AREA THAT IS A LOT TO DO 
WITH HIS SIZE I BELIEVE IT HELPS 
THE ONE HIS ACCELERATION BUT NOT 
SO GOOD WITH THE BREAKING 
A ROUND 
OF APPLAUSE THERE FOR A JORGE 
LORENZO THE RUN DOWNHILL WE ABOUT IT 
YESTERDAY PULLS UP THE ELEVATION 
CHANGES HERE ARE BIG TRICKY PART 
OF IT WEAR DOWN THE BOTTOM END OF 
THE CIRCUIT NOW WE ARE 
THAT'S A 
BIG A FIRM PASS THEIR 
NOT A PLACE 
YOU WOULD EXPECT TO PASS THEIR 
THAT WAS AS NEAT AS IT GETS HERE 
WE GO OFF FIGURE THAT COME UP 
VALENTINO ROSSI WILL SEE THAT HE 
CANNOT GO WHERE HE WANTS TO GO OFF 
LIKUD THAT LOOK AT THAT 
ROSSI 
ROSSI HAVING LOOK TO COME BACK 
WE HAVE 
SEEN ROSSI DO THAT PASS ON THAT TO 
PLACE BEFORE 
HE FEARS BUT THAT IS 
A ROSSI'S PASS YES 
ROSSI THE ON 
THE NOW EXTRACTING ANY PERFORMANCE 
ARE OUT OF THE BRIDGE STONES 
BRIDGESTONE TYRES WHAT CAN DANI PEDROSA DO THIS IS 
BAD NEWS FOR HIM HE NEEDS TO GET 
IN FRONT OF ROSSI 
HAVING A BIT OF 
A FIGHT PAST THERE I THINK ROSSI IS ALREADY INTO A BIT 
OF A TYRE PROBLEM DANI PEDROSA IS 
SURELY GOING TO GET THROUGH 
STRAIGHT AWAY ROSSI FANTASTIC ON 
THE BRAKES 
JORGE LORENZO GETS TO 
THE FRONT FASTEST LAP 
HE HAS A 
MORE FRONT THAN A RAT WITH A GOLD 
TOOTH LORENZO GOING BACK TO TALKING ABOUT THE 
PASSES THAT SUPPOSEDLY VICTIMS

LORENZO 
THERE HE GOES BIG LOOK LORENZO DOWN THE INSIDE CAN DANI PEDROSA 
MAKE THAT ONE SET STICK THAT WAS VERY NEAT NOT THE QUARRY

LESS PLACES TO PASS BIKES IT IS 
ONE OF THOSE CORNERS WHERE YOU HAVE 
GOT TO ROLL IT THROUGH THEIR

QUESTION WERE NICKY HAYDEN 
PODIUM THE DUCATI ARE HARD TO RIDE

I CHANGED THE MICHELIN PEOPLE HAVE REALLY 
KICKED THEN AND A LOT OF THE 
BRIDGESTONE GUIDES ARE SAYING MY 
FRONT TYRE DOES NOT FEEL AS GOOD AS 
THE USE TWO THE TROUBLE IS THE 
MICHELIN IS GOING FASTER THE 
REASON IS DOESN'T BECAUSE THE TIME 
SHE'S SHOWS THAT OF DON'T 
BELIEVE IT NICKY HAYDEN 
HE IS 
LOOKING BACK LIKE HE DOES NOT KNOW 
WHAT IS GOING ON 
THEY SHOULD NOT 
HAVE WORN AS QUICKLY IT SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN IN REASONABLY GOOD 
CONDITIONS JAMES TOSELAND HAS 
LOVELY IT BECAUSE HE IS MOVING UP 
TO SIX POSITION IS LOVING IT 
NICKY HAYDEN DOESN'T NORMALLY DO 
THAT HE WAS SEVEN THOUSAND IN THE SAVAGE IT 
SEVENTH PLACE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP

SHORT LIFE WILL SOON WHAT I WANT TO SEE MORE STAIRS IF 
LORENZO WINS THIS WHAT SORT OF 
CELEBRATION WILL HE BILL OF WILL 
HE DO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 
SEE IF HE DOES AND OFF STAGE 
PERFORMANCE 
TOSELAND CURRENTLY IN PERFORMANCE SIXTH PLACE HE WAS HOPING FOR A LOT FROM THE 
BIKE THIS WEEKEND 
I DO NOT THINK 
THAT CRASH YESTERDAY THAT SUCH A 
TENDER AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN WE SPOKE ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING 
WITH THE CATTY WE KNOW THAT JUST 
ABOUT EVERY ONE OF THESE BIKES YOU 
CAN CHANGE ITS CHANGE IT WHAT 
HAPPENED 
THE TRACK 
WAS O. K. BUT IT HAPPENED WAS MUCH SLOWER L. TRIED TO STAY 
WITH THEM L. AM VERY HAPPY ABOUT 
THIS RACE THE CRASH IS THE FIRST 
CRASH IT IS O. K. 
NO INJURIES AND A 
REAL CONFIDENCE BOOST FOR YOU TO 
SEE YOU CAN RUN WITH THESE GUYS 
YES I AM HAPPY BECAUSE I AM BEHIND 
THEM I CAN STAY WITH THEM WE DO 
NOT HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE THIS IS 
THE AFFAIR EXPERIENCE DOES THE 
YEAR FOR EXPERIENCE 
THE BIG FIGHT 
BACK 
THIS IS A FIGHT FOR BACK CHAMPIONSHIP POSITIONS WITH STONER 
AND TOSELAND A GUESS WE'RE GOING 
TO FIND OUT THAT THE BIKE IS NOT 
WORKING AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD DO I I THAT DOES NOT LOOK VERY COMFORTABLE 
WE KNOW WITH THE MODERN DAY ABOUT 
THEIR PRODUCT OUT SO THEY CAN 
CHANGE IT INTO WHATEVER THEY WANT 
WITH ENGINE CHARACTERISTICS 
SUSPENSION SO LONG AS THE TEAM 
WORK CLOSELY WITH FEW YOU CAN MAKE 
AT THE SPROG MOTORCYCLE IT IS UP 
TO THE GUYS ON THE MOTORCYCLES 
BESPOKE EVERYBODY HAS TO GEL 
TOGETHER THAT SEEMINGLY HAS 
HAPPENED WITH STONER YOU HAVE 
HEARD FROM THE OTHER GUYS LORENZO THAT GAP IS LOOKING PRETTY 
COMFORTABLE HE CAN SETTLE DOWN 
CAN HE 
IT SEEMS TO BE STABLE YOU 
CANNOT HELP FEELING HE HAS ENOUGH 
TO RESPOND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN 
SEVEN LAPS THESE TYRES DESIGNED TO 
RESET YOUR BIKE AND SUSPENSION SO 
THEY SHOULD FOLLOW PARK DOES THEY 
CROSS THE LINE FALL APART AS 
ROSSI WILL BE THINKING DID I PICK 
THE RIGHT TYRES 
WE ALL KNOW HOW 
GOOD LORENZO IS THE SAME AS THAT 
ROSA PEDROSA L. BELIEVE THAT 
ROSSI IS CAPABLE OF RUNNING WITH 
THESE TYRES WHEN HE IS ON THE SAME 
EQUIPMENT WAS HE IS STILL THE 
FASTEST OF HIS GROUP BY A LONG WAY 
WAY EDWARDS CALLS ROSSOUW THE 
GREATEST OF ALL TIME FALSE STUMP 
ROSSI OF LISTEN TO THE ELECTRONICS ON THIS 
BIKE L. WOULD BE 
THIS BAIT INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT IS FLAPPING 
AROUND MAYBE IT IS A LOCKING 
SYSTEM THAT MONITORS THE CHANNELS 
TO SEE WHAT THE BIKE IS DOING EVERY ONE OF THESE GUYS WILL BE 
THINKING DEADEYE BUT THAT THEN 
DID I PUT THAT IN 
IT WAS A VERY 
DIFFERENT PICTURE AT THE START OF 
LAST YEAR STONER IS GOING TO HAVE TO WORK 
EVERY BIT AS HARD AS HE DID WE'RE 
NEXT OFF TO THE RACE IN CHINA THAT 
IS FAST 
THEY EXPECT HIM TO COME 
BACK EXPECT HIM HE FIGHT HARDER 
THAN MOST FIGHT'S IF JAMES CAN HANG IN THERE THAT IS 
GOING TO MOVE HIM UP ONE PLACE IN 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP GREAT NEWS ABOUT THE TECH THREE YAMAHA 
TEAM WE KNOW HOW THEY HAVE DEALT 
TOGETHER 
IT GIVES YOU CERTAINTY TOGETHER YES IT IS ONE THING YOU DON'T PUT 
OUT OF YOUR MIND YOU NEED TO BE 
FOCUSED ON WHAT YOU CAN WHAT

ENDED THIS CHAMPIONSHIP DOG INTO THE BRISTOL REPRESENTATIVE 
LAST NIGHT THIS HAS NEVER BEEN A 
GOOD CIRCUIT FOR THEM TALKING TO THE OTHER BIKES HAVE RESPONDED

TELL 
HE MAY WELL HAVE REASONABLY TELL THOUGHT HE HAD A GOOD SHOT AT THAT 
FELL SHOT AT THAT JAMES TOSELAND 
NEVER FAILING TO PLEASE US WITH 
RACE CRAFT AND TACTICS 
WHY YOU'RE 
COCKY ABOUT JAMES TOSELAND WHILE 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JAMES TOSELAND 
HERE IS THE TEAM MANAGER PULSAR HE 
LOOKED LIKE HE WAS SLIDING AROUND 
WAS THE END THERE

HIS WEEKEND FOR COMING BACK NICKY HAYDEN FOUR ON TIME HE WAS 
THE FASTEST GUY ON THEIR TRACK 
I'VE BEEN THERE WILL BE BREATHING A 
SIGH OF RELIEF AT THE CAPITAL'S UP

SIGH OF RELIEF AT DE KATICH DUST 
TO CAPTIVE BEST TO CAPTIVE LET'S LET'S LOOK AT THE CELEBRATIONS 
HE'S GOING TO STICK THAT FLAG RIGHT 
THROUGH HIS CHEST L. DON'T THINK HE 
CAN BELIEVE IT HE HAS HAD THOSE 
PROPOSITIONS BUT HE WAS PROBABLY 
THE GAME HE COULD NOT CONVERT IT A A WE ARE RIGHT IN THE THICK OF IT 
HERE A VERY GOOD RIDE FOR JAMES 
THE FIRST LAP OF THAT RACE AS JUST 
GOT BACK TO THAT IT WAS SO 
INCREDIBLE 
TOPPER BED CLOSE RACING INCREDIBLE TALK ABOUT CLOSE RACING YOU JUST 
NEVER KNOW QUITE HOW MUCH GRIPPER 
THERE IS GRIP EVERYONE WAS 
TENTATIVELY TRYING TO FIND THEIR 
WAY WHERE TO GO THEY ARE ALL 
WATCHING WHAT IS GOING ON WITH 
EVERYONE VALENTINO ROSSI AT THE 
EARLY STAGES HE DIVED UP THE INSIDE 
IT LOOKED LIKE HE MIGHT HE POET 
JORGE LORENZO WAS NEVER GOING TO 
GET THROUGH 
THEY CALL HIM UP ROUND 
THE OUTSIDE IT BUT IS HIS NICKNAME 
THEY CALL HIM ROUND THE OUTSIDE 
IT IS A DIFFICULT TO KNOW HOW FAST 
TO GO WHEN IT IS RAINING 
THERE IS ANOTHER MORNING THERE FROM 
A DANI PEDROSA IT HIT HIM A WHILE 
TO REGROUP AND BY THE TIME HE DID 
HE WAS IN SECOND PLACE POSSIBLY 
ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING FIRST LAPS 
EVER HAVE WITH THE ELEMENT OF RAIN 
IN THERE AS WELL WHAT ABOUT JORGE 
LORENZO'S PASS ON VALENTINO ROSSI 
QUESTOR MAC HE DID ROSSI ON ROSSI 
THAT KID IS SMART 
WE SAW JANE 
SLIDING AROUND YOU CAN SEE HOW HE 
WAS TRYING TO BE A SEVERE JAMES 
TOSELAND 
GOOD FOR JAMES WHAT THEY TOSELAND THINK IS A INTERESTING AT THE SITE 
AT THE START OF THE RACE YOU HAVE 
ALL DIFFERENT MOTORCYCLES WHEN THE 
GAPS CAME IT WAS JUST ABOUT PEOPLE 
MAT HAS HOPEFULLY GOT THE WINNER OF 
THAT RACE ARE YOU WITH TEMPER 
STIMAC YES 
HE IS JUST PUTTING HIS 
CORPORATE DEAL ON TELL US HOW IT 
FEELS 
HANG ON L. L. DID BELIEVE IT L. FEELS CAN SAY ANYTHING MORE BECAUSE TODAY 
IS THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE 
KENNY THINK OF THAT DAY CAN YOU 
THINK OF THAT MOVIE DID ON 
VALENTINO MOVE 
I SAW THAT IT 
WAS THE MOMENT TO PASS HIM TO TRY 
TO GALWAY GO AWAY THIS HAPPENED 
TO PERFECTION 
THE FIRST OF MANY 
THAT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY RACE L. 
WISH MATE JUST GOT HIS HANKY OUT L. 
WAS CHARLIE HAD SAID THAT LET'S 
HAVE A LOOK AT A BIT OF ANALYSIS 
AND DEBATE ABOUT LORENZO ON THE 
TRACK MEDALS TODAY IS ON HIS 
COMING OF AGE TODAY IS REALLY 
HIS COMING OF AGE 
LORENZO LOOKS TO 
COMING BACK HE IS LATE ON THE 
BRAKES HE BLOCKS DANI PEDROSA AND 
IT KISSES HIM OUT WIDE ALL THOSE 
PASSES WORK VERY SAFE WERE VERY 
SAFE 
IT WAS HIS FABULOUS AND IT SAFE MADE IT STICK ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
VALENTINO ROSSI IS TRYING TO LAY 
THE BIKE DOWN BUT THERE IS NOWHERE 
TO GO 
THE MAN THAT HIS SECOND 
TODAY IT IS WITH MATT 
A SOLID 
SECOND PLACE 
WE MAKE A MISTAKE IN 
THE BOX I MADE A MISTAKE THE WIND 
WAS TRAINING SO CHANGING SO WE 
DID NOT KNOW WHICH GEAR TO BE 
L. 
DID NOT KNOW WHICH GEAR TO BE TEN I WAS AFRAID TO PIERCE THE ENGINE 
SECOND PLACE IS GOOD HERE IT WAS 
ALL WAS RAINING SO IT IS GOOD IF 
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP WE HAVE TO 
THINK FOR THE NEXT ONE TRYING TO 
CALL THE SAME WAY 
I THINK SUSIE 
AT JOINT TOP OF THE TABARD CHIP 
WITH A JORGE LORENZO 
CHAMPIONSHIP IT LOOKED LIKE A 
REALLY TOUGH BATTLE AT JAMES WHAT 
A LOT YOU HAVE HAD TO COPE WITH 
THIS WEEKEND A GOOD FINISH FOR YOU 
TODAY 
I MESSED AROUND IN THE FIRST TODAY COUPLE OF LAPS AND I GOT RAIN 
SPOTS ON THE BUYS L. WASN'T 
AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH ON THE FIRST FEW 
LAPS AND I LOST A BIT OF DISTANCE 
WITH THE LEADERS TO BE FIFTH IN THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP IT IS ENCOURAGING 
HOW DIFFICULT WAS THAT WHEN THE 
RAIN WAS COMING DOWN BECAUSE HE 
DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS GOING TO 
BE SLIPPY 
THAT IS THE ONLY PROBLEM 
NOT KNOWING THE TRACK ON THE 
TRACKS THAT YOU KNOW YOU'VE ALWAYS 
GOT EXPERIENCE IN THOSE KIND OF 
CONDITIONS L. DO WANT TO SAY TOO 
MUCH BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE EXCUSES 
BUT I WAS NOT AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH L. 
JUST WANT TO THANK YAMAHA FOR THE 
NEW ENGINE IT IS A BIT FRUSTRATING 
THAT I WAS NOT FURTHER TOWARDS THE 
FRONT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING 
TO THE TRACKS THEY DO NOT AND 
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PACKAGE WE 
HAVE GOT I DO KNOW 
THAT WAS A 
SOLID PERFORMANCE 
IT WAS JUST 
WHAT WE WERE SAYING ABOUT THOSE 
CONDITIONS HE ADMITS HE WAS NOT 
AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH BUT BETTER THAN 
FALLING DOWN AND GETTING NO POINTS 
IF ANYBODY HAD OFFERED HIM AT THIS 
PLACE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 
HE WOULD HAVE GRABBED IT 
IT HAS 
BEEN A USE FLATTERY FOR JORGE 
LORENZO HE TAKES THE WINNER FROM 
VALENTINO CHRIS VERMEULEN DE FROM 
VALENTINO GREAT STUFF FROM 
VALENTINO YOU CAN'T SAY TOO MUCH 
ABOUT LORENZO THE FIRST GUIDE TO 
GET THE YOUNGEST GUY TO GET THREE 
SUCCESSIVE PODIUMS A FEW RIDERS 
NOT FINISHING 
VALENTINO ROSSI ANOTHER PODIUM A 
USING BUT YOU FELT THAT YOU NEEDED 
TO ESCAPE IF YOU WANTED TO WIND US 
UP AND TRIED AT THE BEGINNING 
I TRIED AT THE BEGINNING AT THE 
BABY ARE WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE 
THERE WAS SOME SPOTS OF RAIN A 
BEGINNING THEY WERE TOO FAST FOR 
ME TO BE BUT ANYWAY ANOTHER POINT 
IS NOT SO BAD WE'RE WAITING FOR A 
BETTER TRACK FOR US 
WE CAN'T GO 
WITHOUT HEARING FROM VALENTINO HE 
WAS SAYING THE SAME THING ABOUT THE 
RAIN 
HE WAS THE BUSTERS GUY IN RAIN THOSE CONDITIONS HE WAS THE 
BRAVEST BULLS UP HE WAS THE PAST 
HAS DIED HE WAS BRAVEST 
HIS TYRES WERE BETTER 
DO YOU WANT 
TO ASK HIM A QUESTION THIS IS 
ROWNTREE R. ROUND FOR WILL BE 
COMING UP IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME 
ROUND ITS THREE ROUND AT FOUR WILL 
BE COMING UP IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME 
I WILL NOT BE IN CHINA BUT YOU 
WILL BE IN THE SAFE HANDS OF STEVE

EXCITING AS THE SEASON GOES ON A 
AND FANTASTIC WHEN FOUR OR JORGE
