I MAY NOT MARRY BRAD PITT 
I WAS THINKING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF SCARRING WOUND BREAKDOWN EVEN NECROSIS OF THE NAVEL 
THAT'S WHEN YOUR BELLY BUTTON ROTS 
YES THANK YOU NURSE JACKSON 
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT THIS IS NOT A PROCEDURE TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY 
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S NOT ESSENTIAL 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A WOMAN WITH A WARDROBE FULL OF SIZE EIGHT VERSACE 
I'D SAY THAT WAS AN EMERGENCY WOULDN'T YOU 
WHICH ADDS UP TO A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT ON AN INTENTION TO TREAT BASIS 
SO IN SUMMARY I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THIS MEDICATION HAS 
KILLED ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF THOSE WHO'VE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE PRESCRIBED IT 
NOT WORTH IT IS IT 
YOU BUST A GUT BUT THEY JUST KEEP ON COMING 
DEPARTMENT OF THE LIVING DEAD 
I'M SORRY 
YOU WERE A NURSE TEN YEARS 
LIKE YOU ALL THE WAY UP 
THEN I WORKED IT ALL OUT 
IT'S JUST A PIE EATING CONTEST

ADAM DEVELOPED A SEVERE INFECTION 
HE WENT INTO DIC LAST NIGHT 
I WAS HOPING TO FIND YOU BEFORE 
BEFORE I WALKED IN 
I'M SORRY 
I BROUGHT HIM THIS I THOUGHT HE MIGHT LIKE IT 
IT'S HARD 
WHEN YOU GET CLOSE I SOMETIMES WONDER WHETHER WE SHOULD ALLOW OURSELVES THAT PRIVILEGE 
PEOPLE DIE IN THIS BUSINESS THAT'S WHAT CHARLES ALWAYS SAID 
ONE SIMPLY HAS TO GET USED TO IT 
REASSURINGLY APPALLING 
CHARLES WAS RIGHT YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE TO COPE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER 
WHAT IF I'M NOT UP TO IT 
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THIS WAS ALL A DREADFUL MISTAKE 
ME BEING HERE THE FOUNDATION 
I MEAN WHAT IF I CAN'T DO WHAT YOU DO 
COPE 
WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL 
THEY USED TO MAKE US DO CROSS COUNTRY RUNNING 
PURE TORTURE AFTER ABOUT A MILE OR SO 
I WOULD FEEL COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED JUST PUTTING ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF ANOTHER 
BUT ALL THE OTHER KIDS WELL 
IT LOOKED COMPLETELY EFFORTLESS LIKE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CARE IN THE WORLD 
I FELT LIKE A TOTAL FAILURE 
AND THEN ONE WEDNESDAY IT WAS ALWAYS A WEDNESDAY I WAS RUNNING AND I CAUGHT 
MY REFLECTION IN A WINDOW AND YOU KNOW WHAT I LOOKED LIKE 
I'VE NO IDEA 
JUST LIKE THE OTHERS 
LIKE I DIDN'T HAVE A CARE IN THE WORLD 
YOU'VE USED THAT BEFORE 
GUILTY IT IS ONE OF MY BETTER ONES THOUGH 
YOU HELPED HIM 
WHATEVER THE OUTCOME 
YOU MADE ONE OF HIS DAYS JUST A LITTLE BETTER 
THANK YOU 
FOUND YOU 
SORRY I'M NOT INTERRUPTING ANYTHING AM I 
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THE NURSE WE EMPLOYED TO REPLACE THE NURSE

DID SHE GO INTO DETAIL NOT EXACTLY 
JUST SANG YOUR PRAISES WELL I THINK THERE'S ONE PROPOSAL YOU MIGHT FIND INTERESTING 
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT ON THE WARD ROUND 
AND I PROMISE NOT TO GET IN YOUR WAY TODAY 
I REMEMBER CHARLES DID HATE TO BE DISTRACTED FROM THE JOB IN HAND 
IT'S JUST NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE DO HERE 
I HATE HAVING TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TWICE 
I'M GOING TO HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM THIS ISN'T THE TIME 
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE I CAN PIN HIM DOWN 
THOSE CARCASSES AREN'T LEVEL 
THE FITTINGS ARE COMING LOOSE ALREADY

IF YOU WANT SOMETHING JUST HAVE IT YOU KNOW ALL POSITIVE 
YOU DON'T EVEN SEEM SCARED ABOUT GOING UNDER THE KNIFE NO A LITTLE 
BUT I THINK THE RISK IS WORTH IT WELL I'VE NEVER MET A MAN I'D DIE FOR 
OR EVEN HAVE A MINOR COMPLICATION FOR 
I WANT TO BE THE BEST I CAN POSSIBLY BE IF THAT MEANS A LITTLE SURGERY THEN BRING IT ON 
IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME SORT OF THING 
PEOPLE WANT TO JOIN A WINNING TEAM

ARTIST'S HANDS WOULDN'T YOU SAY I GUESS

WELL I CAN ONLY APOLOGISE IF YOU CONSIDER ANY OF THIS INAPPROPRIATE 
RACHAEL IS SIXTEEN AND SERIOUSLY ILL

I THINK I SPEAK FOR BOTH OF US WHEN I INSIST THAT SHE AND BEN ARE KEPT STRICTLY SEPARATE FROM NOW ON

A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT PERHAPS BUT YOU CAN SEE WHERE HE GETS IT FROM 
PERHAPS WE OVERREACTED 
I DON'T MIND HER HAVING A BOYFRIEND NOT REALLY 
WHAT HURTS IS 
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER 
YOU THINK ABOUT IT DON'T YOU 
FROM THE MOMENT YOU FIRST HOLD THEM YOU THINK ABOUT THEIR WEDDING DAY 
NOT ALL THE TIME BUT YOU CAN'T HELP THINKING ABOUT IT 
IN THE LAND OF PRIVATE PRACTICE THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT 
IT'S THEIR MONEY IF THEY WANT AN EXTRA 
BOOB ON THE TOP OF THEIR FOREHEAD WHO'S TO SAY THEY CAN'T HAVE IT 
SO YOU WOULD HAVE IT DONE 
HYPOTHETICALLY 
WHAT AN EXTRA JUG 
MRS. TODD'S ABDOMINOPLASTY 
SHE'S INTELLIGENT SHE'S ATTRACTIVE 
SO WHY SHE'S NOT WRONG 
IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE PUSHING IT A BIT 
SHE'S FORTY TWO EXACTLY YOU'VE GOT TO DO WHAT IT TAKES 
REGARDLESS OF THE RISKS 
I'M GUESSING YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DOWN TO CHICAGO ROCKS RECENTLY 
COMPETITION IS FIERCE 
OH AND HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING I'D WANT A BIG FAT DISCOUNT 
THEY'RE WRONG ABOUT HIM YOU KNOW

COPS AND ROBBERS 
JUST COPS AND BLOODY ROBBERS

WHEN'S IT COMING BOUT AN HOUR THEY RECKON 
THOUGHT YOU'D LOOK A LITTLE PLEASED 
JUST NERVOUS I SUPPOSE 
THAT'S ALLOWED 
I WOULD BE

TOP OF THE LIST AND ALL THAT 
C'MON BEN IN CASE HE CHANGES HIS MIND 
WAIT

LATER 
I WAS EXPECTING MORE INSTANT 
NOT IN MY OFFICE 
BEN'S HEART ARRIVED IN THE NICK OF TIME 
YES HE DEFINITELY NEEDS IT 
AND THE GIRL RACHAEL 
UNFORTUNATELY LOWER PRIORITY 
NOT TO HER FATHER 
BEN MAY PUT ON A BRAVE FACE 
BUT HIS ECHO WAS APPALLING 
YOUR PROPOSAL 
I MUST ADMIT I'M STRUGGLING A BIT 
YOU'RE ACTUALLY SUGGESTING THAT OUR PATIENTS ARE OPERATED ON BY ROBOTS 
HYBRID THEATRES WILL REVOLUTIONISE OUR PRACTICE 
WE WILL ACHIEVE EARLIER DISCHARGE SIGNIFICANT PAIN REDUCTION 
AT A PRICE WELL I COULD DELIVER FOR A MILLION PER THEATRE 
OBVIOUSLY OVER TIME WE'D SAVE MORE MONEY 
BUT WE WOULD BE THE ONLY ACTIVE UNIT IN THE COUNTRY 
AH FIRST AMONG EQUALS 
BETTER PATIENT CARE 
AND YOU DO HAVE JAYNE GRAYSON'S BACKING FOR ALL THIS 
ABSOLUTELY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
WE HAVE A PROBLEM 
YOU CAN'T FORCE ME TO HAVE IT WITHOUT THIS TRANSPLANT YOU WILL DIE 
I CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN 
I CAN WAIT NO BEN YOU CAN'T 
YOU ARE FIFTEEN 
THAT MEANS YOU'RE NOT COMPETENT TO REFUSE TREATMENT THAT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE 
PERHAPS I COULD TALK TO BEN 
BEN WE CAN'T ALLOW YOU TO REFUSE THIS OPERATION 
NOT WITHOUT THE SPECIFIC CONSENT FROM YOUR GUARDIAN EVEN THEN HOLD UP 
SO YOU'RE SAYING IT'S UP TO ME 
EFFECTIVELY YES WELL END OF DISCUSSION BEN HAS THE HEART 
PROMISED THIS TO MR. CULLEN O. K. IF I LEAVE IT WITH YOU WHERE'S MY BRIBE 
WE'VE ALL GOT A BUDGET SORRY 
THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE TWIGGED IT BY NOW YEAH 
THEY MIGHT CALL YOU A CONSULTANT BUT DO THEY SHOW YOU THE MONEY 
TELL YOU WHAT I USED TO PUSH ANTIDEPRESSANTS 
AT LEAST UNTIL BEFORE THE TRIAL CAME BACK BIT OF A MIXED BAG 
HALF CHEERED UP HALF TOPPED THEMSELVES I KNOW THE FEELING LOOK 
PEOPLE LIKE US WE'VE DONE OUR BIT DONE OUR NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE 
SO WHY NOT START LOOKING AFTER NUMERO UNO WE NEED PEOPLE WITH CREDIBILITY 
WHEN YOU'RE READY 
GIVE ME A CALL 
DRAIN'S A LITTLE HIGH I COULD HAVE DONE IT YOU KNOW 
I KNOW IT WAS A CHEST DRAIN 
IT'S HARDLY BRAIN SURGERY 
FUNNY I NEVER FOUND NEUROSURGERY THAT DIFFICULT 
I'M A GOOD SURGEON AND YOU'LL 
LOOK LAST WEEK I VALUE YOU 
I WANT YOU TO HAVE A CAREER WALK THEN RUN 
I'LL TELL HER THANK YOU BYE ER MRS. BEAUCHAMP 
BEN'S HEART'S THIRTY MINUTES AWAY 
RIGHT YOU MAKE SURE HE'S PREPPED 
I'LL TELL THEATRE WHILE 
HE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY YOUNG MAN 
CONNIE MADE THE RIGHT CALL 
NATURALLY 
DISSENT IN THE RANKS 
HE DESERVED TO BE LISTENED TO SURELY 
A DONOR HEART IS A PRECIOUS COMMODITY 
CONNIE UNDERSTANDS THAT 
HER ROBOT PROPOSAL IS FASCINATING DON'T YOU THINK 
I HAVE TO CONFESS 
I UNDERSTAND ABOUT ONE IN THREE OF CONNIE'S IDEAS 
I FIND THAT SMILING AND NODDING TENDS TO DO THE TRICK NONSENSE 
AND I THINK SHE WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT CHOICE AS YOUR MEDICAL ADVISOR 
I THOUGHT I WAS BEING SO SUBTLE 
AND HER BRAVE NEW WORLD 
MAKES PERFECT SENSE 
WE ALL HAVE TO MOVE WITH THE TIMES 
BUT YOU HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE THERE'S A RIGHT MAN FOR EVERY JOB 
AND IN THIS CASE THE RIGHT MAN IS A WOMAN 
I'M BACK 
HEY BABY IT'S ME I GOT YOUR MESSAGE 
ANYWAY GIVE ME A CALL BACK I'LL FILL YOU IN 
O. K. I'LL SPEAK TO YOU LATER BYE 
WAKE HER UP 
OPERATION'S CANCELLED 
WAKE HER UP 
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM 
SHE JUST LOST HER PRESSURE 
BINGO SHE'S GOT BLOOD AROUND HER HEART 
LET'S PREP FOR A PERICARDIOCENTESIS 
I'M NOT GETTING ANYTHING 
STILL GOT ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY SHE'S ARRESTED MARK START COMPRESSIONS PLEASE I NEED THAT NEEDLE 
IT'S A PENETRATING TRAUMA WE SHOULD CRACK HER 
IT'S BEEN A WHILE NO WE GO WITH THE NEEDLE THERE'S NO TIME 
I'D WANT YOU TO IF IT WERE ME 
LEFT THORACOTOMY LET'S GO 
BEN BEN 
BEN 
KNIFE STOP COMPRESSIONS 
RIB SPREADER 
KNIFE 
O. K. NO SIGN OF VENTRICULAR DAMAGE 
WAIT THERE EPICARDIAL VEIN GOT IT 
CLIP 
GOT MY HANDS FULL YOU DO IT 
YOU SEE 
O. K. 
FIBRILLATING 
INTERNAL PADDLES 
FIVE JOULES 
CHARGING SHOCKING 
SINUS 
GOOD OUTPUT LET'S GET AN EXPERT DOWN HERE 
HOW THE HELL DID HE GET HOLD OF DIGITOXIN 
RIGHT WE'VE GOT CAPTURE 
I NEED THE DIGIBIND NOW 
PHARMACY ARE BIKING IT OVER AN HOUR 
WHAT OH COME ON THAT'S TOO LONG 
YOU ARE KIDDING ME 
WHY 
IT WAS AN UNNECESSARY OPERATION 
ISN'T THAT HER CALL 
NOT IN MY THEATRE 
IF YOU NEEDED SOMEONE TO HOLD YOUR HAND YOU JUST SHOULD HAVE ASKED ME 
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT SO I DUMPED IT ON YOU 
BUT I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO BE HER PSYCHOLOGIST 
I WAS BEING A DOCTOR 
I'M GETTING THAT DEJA VU FEELING ALL OVER AGAIN 
THIS WAS AN UNNECESSARY PROCEDURE 
IN A PATIENT WHOSE MOTIVATIONS WERE TO SAY AT THE LEAST QUESTIONABLE YOU KNOW WHAT 
I LIKE TO CONCENTRATE ON MY JOB AND LEAVE THE TOUCHY FEELY STUFF TO OPRAH CLAUDIA TODD IS AN ADULT 
ADULTS CHOOSE TO DO STUFF 
AND WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO DO THE WRONG STUFF 
YOU KNOW WHAT FORGET IT I'LL TALK TO HER 
CLEAN UP THIS WHOLE MESS WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY EXACTLY 
I DUNNO I'M GONNA TELL HER THAT.WE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE THEATRE AND WE HAD TO RESCHEDULE 
I'M NOT PREPARED TO CARRY OUT THIS PROCEDURE 
WELL THEN IT'S GOOD FOR HER THAT I AM 
SO I'M THINKING BY NOW I'VE GOT YOUR ATTENTION 
YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I WANT 
RACH 
IT'S MY LIFE 
IT'S MY CHOICE 
AND I'VE CHOSEN YOU 
I LOVE YOU 
DON'T WASTE IT 
REMEMBER ME 
DAD 
SORRY DAD 
SORRY 
THAT'S THAT'S ALL THERE IS 
RIGHT SO WHAT NOW 
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS PAINFUL FOR YOU BUT WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION 
NO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MY BOY HE'S STILL TOO UNSTABLE 
IF WE ATTEMPT TO OPERATE IT COULD BE FATAL 
BUT RACHAEL HAS A GOOD CHANCE 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND SO WHAT 
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO LET MY BOY DIE 
LOOK AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER HIS BRAIN IS DAMAGED 
AND WE HAVE TO FACE THE FACT THAT 
HE MAY NEVER RECOVER HEART OR NO HEART 
BUT THERE IS STILL HOPE EXACTLY YOU SAID YOU WERE DOING TESTS 
YEP AND THE E. E. G. WILL HELP BUT THIS HEART CAN'T WAIT 
I PROMISE YOU WE WILL DO EVERYTHING FOR HIM IF THERE IS A DONOR 
NO LOOK BEN HAS A HEART THIS ONE 
BUT IF WE OPERATE NOW HIS CHANCES OF SURVIVAL ARE MINIMAL 
MR. STOLL IN THIS SITUATION WE HAVE TO THINK OF OTHER PATIENTS' INTEREST AND 
IF RACHAEL STANDS THE BEST CHANCE THEN 
IT IS OUR DUTY TO PERFORM THE OPERATION ON HER IN BEN'S PLACE 
NO NO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND 
THIS IS BEN'S HEART ALL RIGHT HE WAS FIRST 
FIRST ON THE LIST AND THAT IS IT 
NO 
YOU HEARD WHAT MR. HOPE SAID 
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY BEN DIES SO I LIVE RACHAEL DO YOU TRUST ME 
THEN YOU KNOW I WOULD NEVER LIE TO YOU IF THERE WAS ANY ALTERNATIVE 
WOULD YOU DO IT 
CHOOSE TO LIVE KNOWING SOMEONE ELSE IS GONNA DIE 
THEN DO IT FOR ME 
SAY YES FOR ME 
I'M BEGGING YOU I'M SORRY MUM 
I CAN'T I'M SORRY 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND BEN CAN'T REFUSE THE HEART BUT RACHAEL CAN 
RACHAEL IS SIXTEEN IT COMPLICATES MATTERS 
LEGALLY SHE CAN REFUSE TREATMENT SO IF WE WANT 
TO GO AHEAD WITH THE TRANSPLANT WE NEED TO GO TO A MAGISTRATE 
AND EVERY MINUTE THAT THE HEART WAITS IS A MINUTE LOST 
WHICH WILL TAKE TIME WE JUST DON'T HAVE 
AND FORCING HER TO HAVE THE OPERATION AGAINST HER WILL 
I SEE NO OTHER OPTION 
MR. STOLL 
RACHAEL REFUSED THE HEART 
I THOUGHT YOU OUGHT TO KNOW 
MY SON DIED 
NOT LONG AGO I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT 
HE'D BEEN ILL 
FOR A LONG TIME 
SO IN A WAY IT WAS LIKE HE NEVER GREW UP 
ANOTHER PETER PAN I MEAN KIDS 
GROW UP NOT REALLY 
JUST STUCK IN HERE 
WAITING TO GET BETTER GOING NOWHERE 
OR OR JUST TO LET HIM GO 
NEITHER ONE THING OR THE OTHER 
WE KNOW WHAT BEN WANTS 
IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO RACHAEL 
IT MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
ALL RIGHT 
WELL SHE'S AWAKE NOW AND SHE'S TAKING NO PRISONERS 
ALL RIGHT I'LL TALK TO HER 
HOPE YOU'VE GOT YOUR BULLET PROOF VEST AND A LAWYER SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SUING YOU 
IT WAS KINDA HARD TO TELL IN BETWEEN THE SWEARING 
I'LL STRAIGHTEN IT OUT 
WELL GO ON THEN RACH DON'T KEEP 'EM WAITING WILL YA 
IT'S THE RIGHT DECISION 
I'M SORRY 
I HAVE TO GO 
OF COURSE GO GO 
I CAN EXPLAIN AND YES I KNOW THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY BUT THIS TIME IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE 
COME ON DONNA 
ANNALISE FOUND MY CREDIT CARD BILL 
I HAD NO CHOICE EITHER EXPLAIN TO HER ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OR COVER I COVERED NATURALLY 
WELL NOW SHE'S GOT A MATCHING PAIR COVER THAT COME ON I GOT THIS FOR YOU 
WELL I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND A HOME FOR IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF YOU HAD A DRAWER FULL 
O. K. ALL RIGHT 
BUT TELL ME 
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS 
ELLIOT THERE MAY BE ANOTHER DONOR SAME TRAUMA HOW LONG 
OVER AN HOUR MAYBE LONGER 
THE FILTER WON'T HOLD HIM NO SO WE WAIT ON BYPASS 
SORRY COULD YOU 
THAT'S AN EXTREME POSITION 
ONE THAT WOULD BE HARD TO DEFEND 
HIS CEREBRAL STATUS 
HIS E. E. G. WAS NORMAL 
BUT UNLESS HE WAKES UP THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING FOR SURE 
NO AND AS YOU SAY THE FILTER WON'T HOLD 
HIS PRESSURE'S DROPPING ALREADY THERE'S NO TIME 
IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS BRAIN THEN PUTTING HIM ON BYPASS IS HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE 
HIS E. E. G. WAS NORMAL 
I WILL TELL THE COORDINATOR I EXAMINED HIM 
AND HE WAS NEUROLOGICALLY INTACT BEFORE INDUCTION 
WE WAIT ON BYPASS 
YOU'D LIE TO THEM 
ELLIOT THIS NEW HEART IS HIS ONLY CHANCE OF SURVIVAL 
I THINK IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THIS BOY DESERVES THAT DON'T YOU 
I HAVE THREE LAWYERS IN MY PILATES CLASS 
THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHICH ONE TO CHOOSE 
MRS. TODD I ASSURE YOU THERE WAS A VERY GOOD REASON WHY I CANCELLED YOUR SURGERY 
WE HAD A VERY SMALL PROBLEM WITH THE THEATRE 
YOU DO NOT NEED THIS OPERATION 
THAT IS MR. GRIFFIN'S PERSONAL OPINION 
I HOWEVER AM VERY HAPPY TO PROCEED 
AND I CAN PREP A NEW THEATRE FOR YOU IMMEDIATELY 
THIS WOMAN IS NOT OVERWEIGHT 
IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION YOU DO NOT NEED THIS PROCEDURE 
THIS WOMAN HAS ASKED US TO OPERATE ON HER 
WHICH WE RESPECT WHATEVER YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION 
AND PUT HER LIFE AT RISK 
A ROUTINE ABDOMINOPLASTY CARRIES A MINIMAL RISK 
APART FROM THE ANAESTHETIC 
WHICH YOU ALLOWED HER TO HAVE FOR NO REASON THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS 
THIS SURGERY IS YOUR DECISION 
EXACTLY WHICH IS WHY I'M GOING TO HAVE IT DONE BY DOCTORS I CAN TRUST 
THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE THEATRE 
NURSE JACKSON TOLD ME EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
SHE ASKED 
AND I DON'T EXPECT TO BE CHARGED 
I STAND BY MY DECISION 
AND I ADMIRE YOU I REALLY DO 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M A PROFESSIONAL 
I GIVE MY PATIENTS WHAT THEY ASK FOR AND I DO A DAMN GOOD JOB AT IT 
WHAT I DON'T DO IS SUBJECT THEM TO UNNECESSARY ANAESTHETICS AND I NEVER 
EVER UNDERMINE MY COLLEAGUES IN FRONT OF THEM 
BUT YOU WERE PREPARED TO LIE TO HER 
I WAS TRYING TO RESCUE THE SITUATION 
WHAT IF SHE SUES WHAT IF SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED 
THEN I'D BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HARMING A PATIENT WHEN I KNEW FULL WELL THE OPERATION WAS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY 
YOU WANTED IN AND I LET YOU IN 
BUT RIGHT NOW I'M STARTING TO THINK I MADE A VERY BIG MISTAKE 
NO NO I MADE THE MISTAKE THIS IS NOT MEDICINE 
THIS IS TRASH 
ALL WE'RE DOING IS EXPLOITING PEOPLE'S INSECURITIES JUST TO TURN A FAST BUCK 
WHICH YOU NEEDED AT ONE POINT CORRECT 
BUT MAYBE NOW YOU'VE MADE ENOUGH OF THAT TRASHY CASH TO AFFORD YOUR PRECIOUS CONSCIENCE AGAIN 
ENJOY IT 
O. K. 
GOOD 
HARDLY ANY MYOCARDIUM THANK YOU 
ARE WE READY 
LIKE IT WAS MADE FOR HER

SOMEBODY COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIM 
THERE ARE PROCEDURES THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO CHECK 
SHE SAID SHE WAS HER SISTER 
YOU DON'T ASK TO SEE I. D. CARDS 
YOU TRUST PEOPLE THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD REVIEW THAT POLICY 
WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD REVIEW MINIMAL STAFFING LEVELS LOOK AROUND YOU

A HOME FROM HOME PROJECT 
I WANT TO PROVIDE SOMEWHERE WHERE OUR PATIENTS CAN BE WITH THEIR FAMILIES 
BEFORE OR AFTER THEIR OPERATIONS
