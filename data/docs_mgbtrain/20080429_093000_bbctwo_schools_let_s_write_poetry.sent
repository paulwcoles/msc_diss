TAKE ONE FARM SIXTEEN CHILDREN AND A WEEK OFF SCHOOL 
WHAT COULD BE BETTER BUT THERE IS A TWIST 
THEY VOLUNTEERED FOR A CRASH COURSE IN POETRY WRITING AND IN FOURS 
WILL SPEND FIVE DAYS WRITING AND BEING INSPIRED BY DIFFERENT POETRY 
SO LET'S MEET TODAY'S GROUP CALLUM SHONA KEARA AND LORCAN 
AS THEY SETTLE IN WITHOUT PARENTS TEACHERS OR EVEN T. V. 
INSTEAD THERE'S LOTS OF ANIMALS TO LOOK AFTER THEIR OWN POET IN RESIDENCE ON HAND TO HELP THEM 
POEMS ON FILM TO INSPIRE THEM AND A SURPRISE VISIT FROM A POET 
BUT FIRST HERE'S TODAY'S TEAM 
MY NAME'S SHONA AND I'M FROM BIRMINGHAM 
I ENJOY POETRY WRITING BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ANY RULES AND YOU CAN WRITE ABOUT ANYTHING 
MY NAME IS LORCAN I'M TEN AND I COME FROM KENT 
THIS IS MY GECKO 
I LIKE HAVING A GECKO BECAUSE IT'S MORE EXOTIC THAN A CAT OR HAMSTER 
MY NAME IS KEARA I'M TEN YEARS OLD AND I LIVE IN LONDON 
MY HOBBIES INCLUDE SINGING DANCING AND DRAMA 
AS YOU CAN SEE I'M A GIRLY GIRL AND I LOVE PINK 
HI I'M CALLUM AND I COME FROM LONDON 
MY HOBBIES ARE PLAYING PLAYSTATION LISTENING TO MUSIC AND PLAYING WITH MY FRIENDS 
IT'S DAY ONE AT THE WRITING ACADEMY 
IN JUST UNDER FOUR DAYS OUR TEAM WILL HAVE TO PERFORM A FINISHED POEM IN FRONT OF ALL THE OTHER CHILDREN 
BUT THEY STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF POEM THEY WILL BE ASKED TO WRITE 
BUT THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE 
LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND 
KEARA THANK YOU 
CALLUM 
SHONA 
DEAR LORCAN YOUR CHALLENGE IS TO WRITE A POEM BASED ON SOMETHING THAT YOU OBSERVE DURING YOUR WEEK HERE 
YOU SHOULD LOOK CAREFULLY FOR DETAILS AND USE ALL YOUR SENSES TO HELP YOU CHOOSE WORDS 
YOUR AIM IS TO PRODUCE A POLISHED PIECE OF POETRY WHICH YOU WILL PERFORM AT THE END OF THE WEEK 
YOUR POEM SHOULD BE WRITTEN IN FREE VERSE 
ON HAND TO HELP YOU IS KAT FRANCOIS YOUR POET IN RESIDENCE WHO IS WAITING FOR YOU NOW 
IN THE WRITING ROOM WHERE YOU WILL FIND EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO HELP YOU CREATE YOUR POEM 
SO GET STARTED AND GOOD LUCK 
WELCOME TO THE WRITING ROOM GUYS 
YOUR CHALLENGE IS ABOUT OBSERVATION 
LOOKING AT THINGS A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DETAIL THAN YOU NORMALLY WOULD 
KEEP YOU NOTEBOOKS ON YOU AND WRITE DOWN AS MUCH AS YOU CAN 
YOUR POLAROID CAMERAS WILL BE GREAT 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT EVERYTHING DON'T JUST TAKE A STRAIGHT PICTURE 
IF YOU ARE OBSERVING SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SEE THE TINIEST DETAIL 
THE CHILDREN ARE DIVIDED ABOUT USING FREE VERSE 
FREE VERSE IS A POEM THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A STRUCTURE AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO RHYME 
I WANTED TO RHYME BUT BECAUSE IT'S FREE VERSE I DON'T MIND 
I DON'T LIKE RHYMING YOU THINK MORE OF THE RHYME THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
I DON'T REALLY THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THAT EASY 
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE FUN THOUGH 
THIS SOUND MEANS THERE IS A FILMED POEM WAITING TO BE VIEWED 
THEY MUST STOP WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE CINEMA 
THE MAGNIFICENT BULL 
A TRADITIONAL POEM OF THE DINKA TRIBE 
MY BULL IS WHITE LIKE THE SILVER FISH IN THE RIVER 
WHITE LIKE THE SHIMMERING CRANE BIRD ON THE RIVER BANK 
WHITE LIKE FRESH MILK 
HIS ROAR IS LIKE THE THUNDER TO THE TURKISH CANNON ON THE STEEP SHORE 
MY BULL IS DARK LIKE THE RAINCLOUD IN THE STORM 
HE IS LIKE SUMMER AND WINTER 
HALF OF HIM IS DARK LIKE THE STORM CLOUD 
HALF OF HIM IS LIGHT LIKE SUNSHINE 
HIS BACK SHINES LIKE THE MORNING STAR 
HIS BROW IS RED LIKE THE BEAK OF THE HORNBILL 
HIS FOREHEAD IS LIKE A FLAG CALLING THE PEOPLE FROM A DISTANCE 
HE RESEMBLES THE RAINBOW 
I WILL WATER HIM AT THE RIVER 
WITH MY SPEAR I SHALL DRIVE MY ENEMIES 
LET THEM WATER THEIR HERDS AT THE WELL 
THE RIVER BELONGS TO ME AND MY BULL 
DRINK MY BULL FROM THE RIVER 
I AM HERE 
TO GUARD YOU WITH MY SPEAR 
ONE OF THE LINES WAS HE IS AS WHITE AS A SILVER FISH IN THE RIVER 
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS REALLY GOOD 
MAKE SURE IT GOES IN THE BUCKET ONE HASN'T GOT FED THIS ONE 
THE POEM IS ABOUT A VERY DIGNIFIED MAN WHO LOVES HIS BULL 
AND USES DIFFERENT PARTS OF WEATHER AND SEASONS TO DESCRIBE HIS BULL 
IT'S THE END OF DAY ONE AND WHAT HAVE OUR POETS LEARNED 
WE HAD A SESSION WITH KAT EARLIER 
WHICH WAS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE SHE TAUGHT US LOTS ABOUT WRITING 
OUR POEM DURING THE WEEK AND HOW TO OBSERVE DIFFERENT THINGS 
WHICH WAS REALLY INTERESTING AND USING SIMILES AND METAPHORS 
IT'S UP EARLY FOR OUR BUDDING POETS 
AND ARMED WITH THEIR NOTEBOOKS PENCILS AND POLAROIDS THEY'RE OFF TO THE FARM TO LOOK FOR INSPIRATION 
I DON'T WANT POEMS ABOUT COW POOH 
RIGHT GUYS I HOPE YOU ARE ALL TAKING NOTE OF THE THINGS AROUND YOU IT IS BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE 
KAT REMINDS THEM TO USE ALL OF THEIR SENSES 
LOOK AT THE HOUSES LOOK AT THE BARNS LOOK HOW GREEN IT IS 
LOOK AT THE TREES 
WHAT ABOUT SMELLS GUYS CAN YOU SMELL ANYTHING 
WHEN I FED THE CALVES IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE SCREAMING FOR THEIR FOOD 
THE NOISES THE ANIMALS MAKE REALLY INSPIRE YOU 
HE'S TALL ISN'T HE 
WHAT ABOUT HIS COLOUR WHAT DOES HIS COLOUR REMIND YOU OF THAT BROWN 
CHOCOLATE COME ON THEN GUYS 
I TOOK THIS PICTURE TODAY OF A COW AND IT HAS A WHITE PATCH 
ON ITS FOREHEAD AND IT REMINDS ME OF A STAR AT NIGHT TIME 
THE CHILDREN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE PICTURES THEY TOOK 
AND FOLLOWING KAT'S ADVICE THEY USE SENSES TO PICK OUT DETAILS AND DISCUSS WHAT THEY REMIND THEM OF 
LIKE A RIVER OF TOFFEE FLOWING DOWN ITS FOREHEAD 
THE BIT WHICH STANDS OUT FOR ME IS ITS FEET 
THREE OF ITS FEET IS WHITE AND OTHER ONE IS JUST BLACK 
THAT'S A GOOD ONE IT'S LIKE THE HORSE IS WEARING ODD SOCKS 
THE SUN REMINDS ME OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE PASSED AWAY 
AND GONE UP TO AN AFTERLIFE OR SOMETHING 
IF YOU COULD TOUCH THAT SUN IF YOU COULD TOUCH THE RIVER OF TOFFEE WHAT'S IT GOING TO FEEL LIKE 
IS IT GOING TO FEEL SOFT 
IS IT GOING TO FEEL LIKE SILK 
GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE IT IS A BIT HARD TRYING TO COME UP WITH GOOD WORDS 
IT TAKES TIME 
TAKING PICTURES WITH THE POLAROIDS HAS REALLY HELPED A LOT 
IF YOU TAKE A PICTURE YOU COULD SPEND HOURS LOOKING 
AT IT AND YOU'D BE ABLE TO FIND THE DETAIL THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR 
IT'S TIME TO RELAX BUT SHONA IS GETTING WORRIED 
I'M STRUGGLING WHEN I'M WRITING AND GETTING DOWN AND FOCUSSING 
A LOT OF THE TIME I JUST WANT TO RUN AROUND AND DO GYMNASTICS 
I REALLY NEED TO JUST GET DOWN AND WORK 
NO PUTTING IT OFF ANY LONGER IT'S TIME TO START WRITING THOSE POEMS 
I'M THINKING ABOUT WRITING MY WALK 
WHEN I WAS JUST WALKING DOWN THE ROAD AND WHAT I HEARD 
LIKE THE BIRDS SINGING AND THE COWS MOOING AND THE PIGS SQUEALING 
POEMS ARE REALLY GOOD WHEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING THAT REPEATS EVERY VERSE 
SO I THINK I'M GONNA DO THAT IN MY POEM 
THE MAGNIFICENT BULL JUST GAVE ME LOADS OF IDEAS 
WHICH I'VE USED FOR MY POEM 
SO PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THAT POEM SHOULD ENJOY MY POEM 
IT'S CALLED THE WOOL MONSTER BECAUSE I SAW SOME SHEEP THIS MORNING AND THEY WERE REALLY COOL 
FARMER DAVID CAUGHT ONE AND WE GOT TO FEEL ITS FUR 
EVERYBODY HERE LIKES REGGIE THE BULL 
HE'S THE FATHER OF ALL THE BROWN CALVES AND HE'S VERY IMPORTANT HERE 
SO I THOUGHT I'D WRITE ABOUT HIM 
THEIR WRITING GETS INTERRUPTED BY A SURPRISE VISITOR 
THEY HURRIEDLY PREPARE A PICNIC 
I'M BRIAN PATTEN AND I BELIEVE YOU'RE ALL DOING POEMS ABOUT OBSERVATION 
I'VE GOT A POEM ABOUT OBSERVATION 
THIS POEM IS SET ON A BOAT IN THE ARCTIC 
THE POEM IS CALLED A BOAT IN THE SNOW 
ONTO THE OCEAN'S COLD DARK SKIN SNOWFLAKES ARE FALLING AND ARE MELTING AWAY 
HOW STRANGE THE SNOW SEEMS OUT HERE 
HOW QUICKLY THE WHITE BLIZZARD IS SWALLOWED UP BY THE WAVES 
WITHOUT A FRAMEWORK ON LAND EACH FLAKE IS TRANSFORMED INTO A MILLION OCEAN BORN MOTHS 
THEY FLICKER INTO EXISTENCE THEN GO 
AS THE SKY ABOVE ME AND AROUND ME GLITTERS WITH FROSTY FLECKS OF STARS 
SO THE DECK OF THE BOAT GLITTERS AND I WONDER 
ARE WHALES SLEEPING OUT THERE IN THE OCEAN'S DEPTHS 
AND I WONDER DO WHALES REALLY SLEEP AND HOW 
THERE'S NO ONE TO ASK 
SNUGGLED UP IN THEIR CABINS THE CREW ARE DREAMING 
AND ALL AROUND ME STILL THE SNOW IS FALLING 
AND THE SHIP'S DECK HAS BECOME A MOONLIT FIELD A FIELD ADRIFT 
ON THE DARK SKIN OF THE WORLD 
I WOULD LOVE TO SAIL FOR EVER BETWEEN ISLANDS OF SNOW 
I BELIEVE YOU'VE GOT QUESTIONS AS WELL THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ASK ME 
HOW DID YOU BECOME A POET 
I GREW UP IN A HOUSE WHERE THE ADULTS NEVER SPOKE TO EACH OTHER 
VERY MUCH EXCEPT WHEN THEY ARGUED 
AND WHENEVER I HAD ANY FEELINGS INSIDE ME THAT I WANTED TO SHARE 
WITH THEM I COULDN'T SHARE BECAUSE THEY'D NEVER LISTEN TO ME 
SO I STARTED WRITING MY FEELINGS DOWN ON PIECES OF PAPER 
AND SLOWLY OVER TIME THOSE FEELINGS BEGAN TO CHANGE INTO POEMS 
BECAUSE YOU CAN EXPRESS YOUR FEELINGS BEST IN POEMS REALLY 
HOW DO YOU START A POEM 
HOWEVER YOU START IT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
IS TO KEEP A STUB OF PENCIL WITH YOU A BIT OF PAPER OR SOMETHING 
BECAUSE IF YOU GET AN IDEA WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN IS 
THE IDEA WILL GO AWAY IF YOU DON'T WRITE IT DOWN 
AND SOMETIMES THE POEM WON'T HAPPEN AND OTHER TIMES A POEM WILL COME OUT OF THAT IDEA 
WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR IDEAS FROM 
THERE'S THIS SHOP ALONG A BIG DARK ALLEYWAY 
AND THERE ARE JARS OF IDEAS IN THE SHOP AND I GET THEM THERE 
IT'S TRUE BECAUSE THAT'S AN IDEA ISN'T IT 
I GET THEM FROM DIFFERENT PLACES IDEAS 
THE MORE IDEAS YOU WRITE DOWN THE MORE IDEAS YOU GET 
BECAUSE IDEAS BREED EACH OTHER 
DO YOU REDRAFT YOUR POEMS 
I REDRAFT A LOT OF POEMS IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT COMES OUT BAD AT FIRST 
AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO WORK ON 
I OFTEN READ A FIRST DRAFT OUT LOUD TO MYSELF AND WHERE I STUMBLE 
I THINK OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT STUMBLE AS WELL 
I WANT SIMPLE WORDS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE POEMS 
HOW IMPORTANT ARE THE SENSES IN WRITING A POEM 
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE AS MANY SENSES AS YOU CAN 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE SIXTH SENSE IS 
THERE'S A SIXTH SENSE WHERE YOU OBSERVE THINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY 
IT'S CALLED IMAGINATION I HOPE YOU HAVE A LOVELY TIME USING IT HERE 
THANK YOU 
AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING 
AT TEA TIME WE GET A PROGRESS REPORT 
I'VE DONE A DRAFT OF THE POEM THAT I NEED TO DO FOR 
MY CHALLENGE BUT IT'S QUITE LONG SO WHEN I REDRAFT IT I MIGHT SHORTEN IT 
I'VE DONE MY FIRST DRAFT WHICH WASN'T TOO DISASTROUS LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 
THE DAY STARTS OFF WITH A ROOMFUL OF LOCUSTS THE JUMPY ONES 
I KEEP THE JUMPY ONES AS PETS 
THEY'VE GOT THESE LITTLE LIKE FOUR THINGS 
THEY ARE TOLD TO DESCRIBE THEM USING POWERFUL ADJECTIVES AND SIMILES 
SIMILES HELP CREATE AN IMAGE IN THE READER OR LISTENER'S MIND 
BY COMPARING THE SUBJECT TO SOMETHING ELSE 
ITS LEGS ARE LIKE BENDY BROWN TWIGS YOU FIND IN A GARDEN 
ITS WINGS ARE LIKE SILK 
ITS ANTENNAE ARE LIKE A NIB ON A FOUNTAIN PEN 
THEY HAVE RAZOR SHARP TEETH WHICH TEAR TREACHEROUSLY THROUGH LEAVES 
THE LOCUST IS LIKE A KANGAROO JUMPING SWIFTLY THROUGH THE AIR 
WHAT IS A LOCUST 
ITS HEAD A GRAIN OF CORN 
ITS NECK THE HINGE OF A KNIFE 
ITS HORNS A BIT OF THREAD 
ITS CHEST IS SMOOTH AND BURNISHED 
ITS BODY IS LIKE A KNIFE HANDLE 
ITS HOCK A SAW ITS SPITTLE INK 
ITS UNDERWINGS CLOTHING FOR THE DEAD 
ON THE GROUND IT IS LAYING EGGS 
IN FLIGHT IT IS LIKE THE CLOUDS 
APPROACHING THE GROUND IT IS RAIN GLITTERING IN THE SUN 
LIGHTING ON A PLANT IT BECOMES A PAIR OF SCISSORS 
WALKING IT BECOMES A RAZOR 
DESOLATION WALKS WITH IT 
INSPIRED BY THE LOCUSTS 
THEY MAKE SURE THEIR POEMS ARE THE BEST THEY CAN BE 
AND THEY ARE USING DICTIONARIES AND A THESAURUS TO HELP THEM 
IF YOU DO SOME NOT SO GOOD THINGS IN THE DRAFT YOU CAN 
DO SOME BETTER THINGS IN THE REDRAFT 
BEFORE I JUST HAD THE PERSON SINGING AND I THOUGHT IT WASN'T THAT GOOD 
SO I CHANGED IT TO THE GENTLE LULLABY OF THE BIRDS 
I'VE JUST WROTE A NEW POEM 
CALLED THE BULL I'VE JUST REDRAFTED IT AND I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT 
IT'S MY FINAL POEM 
I SAID BOOM CHICK A BOOM 
I SAID A BOOM CHICK A BOOM 
ALL THE POEMS ARE FINISHED NOW BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE 
KAT GIVES THE GROUP SOME WARM UP EXERCISES TO HELP THEM PREPARE 
THROW YOUR VOICES LIKE YOU JUST DID WHEN WE DONE THAT SONG 
REMEMBER YOUR RHYTHM AND PACE ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT 
LOOK UP KEEP YOUR VOICES CLEAR 
AND BE CONFIDENT BECAUSE YOUR WORK'S FANTASTIC BYE 
I'VE GOT A LOT OF TIPS FROM KAT ABOUT HOW TO PROJECT 
MY VOICE AND MAKE SURE I'VE GOT ENOUGH BREATH TO SAY THE WHOLE POEM 
I THINK I'M GOING TO BE TOO QUIET AND I'M GOING TO FORGET EVERYTHING 
I'M GOING TO SEE MY WHOLE LIFE FLASH BEFORE MY EYES 
IT'S THE DAY OF THE PERFORMANCE AND LORCAN IS THE FIRST TO GO 
WILL HE REMEMBER KAT'S ADVICE AND PERFORM TO THE AUDIENCE 
BRISKLY CHARGING ABOUT THE FIELD 
MARKING HIS TERRITORY JOSTLING WITH HIS FRIENDS 
HIS EYES LOCK ONTO ME WITH DISPOSITION 
GLINTING IN THE AUTUMN SUN LIKE OVERSIZED MARBLES 
THE DEW ON THE GRASS SPECKLES LIKE CANDLES 
HE DASHES OVER THE EARTH DAMPING THE FLAMES 
HIS SNOWY FLEECE REMINDS ME OF CHRISTMAS 
AS BUCKETS OF FLAKES POWER THROUGH THE SKY 
HIS TAIL IS LIKE A TEDDY BEAR JUST WANTING TO BE SQUEEZED 
THE WOOL MONSTER IT'S A SHEEP 
INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING HE HAD BIG EYES HE USED OVERSIZED MARBLES 
IT'S GOOD DESCRIPTION 
NEXT UP IS KEARA WHO IS FEELING CONFIDENT 
AS I WALK ALONG THE LUSH GREEN GRASS 
LISTENING TO THE MOANING OF THE HORSES BEGGING FOR NOURISHMENT 
GENTLE LULLABY OF THE BIRDS COWS MOOING LOUDLY FROM A GREAT DISTANCE 
STONES AS HARD AS BRICKS STICK INTO THE SOLE OF MY WELLIES 
AS I STUMBLE ACROSS THE RIPPLING OF THE STREAM WHAT A VIEW 
LISTENING TO THE HORSES TROTTING AND THE COWS GOBBLING THEIR FOOD 
AND THAT'S MY WALK 
HER POEM WAS REALLY DESCRIPTIVE SO THAT'S WHAT I LIKED ABOUT IT 
SHONA'S BEEN DREADING THIS MOMENT ALL WEEK 
MY LITTLE CALF IS BRONZE BRONZE AS THE EVENING SUNLIGHT 
GLIMMERING IN THE CRISP AUTUMN LEAVES 
BRONZE AS HE LIES IN HIS GOLDEN STRAW AND LISTENS DREAMILY 
TO THE BLUETITS TWEET 
BUT HE IS NOT YOURS NOT ANYONE ELSE'S HE IS MINE 
MY LITTLE CALF IS BRONZE 
MY LITTLE CALF IS BRONZE 
BRONZE AS HE HAPPILY SNIFFS IN THE COOL FRESH AIR 
IN THE SULTRY MORNING SUNLIGHT 
BRONZE EVER SINCE HE CAUTIOUSLY OPENED HIS EYES 
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME AND TOOK IN HIS DELIGHTFUL SURROUNDINGS 
BUT HE IS NOT YOURS NOR ANYONE ELSE'S HE IS MINE 
MY LITTLE CALF IS BRONZE 
MY LITTLE CALF IS BRONZE 
BRONZE AS HE SMELLS THE COOL FRESH AIR TASTES HIS PEARLY WHITE MILK 
FEELS THE NEW GOLDEN STRAW LISTENS TO THE BLUETITS 
AS HE OPENS HIS EYES FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME 
BUT HE IS NOT YOURS NOT ANYONE ELSE'S HE IS MINE 
MY LITTLE CALF IS BRONZE 
I LIKED THE CHORUS AND I ALSO LIKE ALL THE METAPHORS AND SIMILES 
AND HOW IT WAS REALLY DESCRIPTIVE 
CALLUM'S FEELING NERVOUS AND DOES A LAST MINUTE PRACTICE 
REGGIE IS MINE I HAVE RAISED HIM SINCE HE WAS A CALF 
AS WE GO TO BATTLE I WILL PROTECT YOU 
AS YOU SHIVER WITH FEAR YOUR LIGHT SABRE EYES TELL ME YOU'RE SCARED 
BUT WHEN I AM HERE YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING 
THE FIREWORKS OF OUR CELEBRATION IS LIKE BRONZE IGNITING IN THE SKY 
JUST FOR YOU MY BULL YOUR HORNS ARE CROWNS 
AS YOU DIE BEFORE MY EYES I WILL WEARYOUR HORNS ON N. Y. SHIELD 
THIS IS MY POEM A TRIBUTE TO YOU 
I LIKED IT WHEN HE SAID IT WAS LIKE ON A SHIELD 
BECAUSE IT MADE HIM FEEL LIKE HE WAS A KING 
FROM THE FIRST WRITE TO THE REDRAFTS I THINK WHAT THEY'VE DONE 
BEING ABLE TO WRITE AND THEN THE PERFORMANCE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
I'M VERY PLEASED TO WORK WITH THEM AND PROUD OF WHAT THEY ACHIEVED 
IT'S ALL POETRY POETRY 
POETRY DARLING
