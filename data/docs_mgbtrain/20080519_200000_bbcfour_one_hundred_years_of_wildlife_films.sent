I REMEMBER GETTING OUR VERY FIRST TELEVISION IT WAS ENORMOUS 
ABOUT THAT SIZE EXCEPT THE SCREEN WAS ABOUT THAT SIZE 
NINE INCHES BLACK AND WHITE 
BUT ON IT I SAW MY VERY FIRST WILDLIFE PROGRAMMES 
THAT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO 
FIFTY YEARS BEFORE THAT 
THE VERY FIRST WILDLIFE FILM APPEARED 
SO THERE HAD BEEN ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF WILDLIFE FILM MAKING 
AND I RECKON IT'S TIME WE LOOKED BACK 
IN THIS TWO HOUR SPECIAL WE'LL BE FEATURING THE PASSIONATE 
INTREPID AND SOMETIMES ECCENTRIC INDIVIDUALS 
WHO'VE GONE TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH 
TO OPEN UP NEW WORLDS TO VIEWERS 
WE'LL CHART THE EXTRAORDINARY CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY THAT HAVE DRIVEN THE INDUSTRY 
AND WE'LL LOOK AT HOW WE THE AUDIENCES 
HAVE BEEN ENTERTAINED AND AFFECTED BY WHAT WE'VE SEEN ON OUR SCREENS 
INDEED THIS CENTURY OF WILDLIFE FILMS MAY REVEAL AS MUCH ABOUT US 
AS ABOUT THE ANIMALS THEMSELVES 
THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS SOME SCENES THAT SOME VIEWERS MAY FIND UPSETTING 
THROUGHOUT HISTORY FIRST DRAWINGS 
THEN PAINTINGS THEN SCULPTURES 
BOOKS EVENTUALLY CAMERAS 
FIRST STILLS THEN MOVIES 
AND ALWAYS THE FAVOURITE SUBJECT WILDLIFE 
NOW LET'S FACE IT ANIMALS DON'T ACTUALLY REHEARSE AND THEY DON'T 
WORK ON THEIR IMAGE LIKE THEY SAY IN SHOW BUSINESS 
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS 
THEY ARE NATURALS 
THE PUPS TRY THEIR BEST TO KEEP ALERT ALONG WITH THEIR PARENTS 
BUT IT'S A BIT OF A STRUGGLE WHEN YOU'VE JUST WOKEN UP 
RIGHT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING FILM MAKERS RECOGNISED THAT ANIMALS 
HAD A HUGE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE 
THIS SOMEWHAT BIZARRE FOOTAGE IS THE EARLIEST KNOWN 
MOVING IMAGE OF A WILD ANIMAL 
IT WAS PICTURES LIKE THIS THAT INSPIRED 
ONE MAN IN PARTICULAR WHEN HE WROTE THE ACTUAL MOVEMENTS OF THE WILD CREATURES CAN NOW BE CAPTURED 
THE SECRETS AND ALL THE WONDERS OF NATURE CAN BE BROUGHT TO THE PLATFORM ALIVE 
AND I WAS DETERMINED TO DO IT 
AND DO IT HE DID 
HE WAS OLIVER PIKE WHO MADE THE FIRST FULLY FLEDGED WILDLIFE FILM TO BE SEEN IN BRITAIN BACK IN NINETEEN OH SEVEN 
IT WAS CALLED IN BIRD LAND 
AND IT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS 
THE PROCEEDS FUNDED PIKE'S SECOND 
AND EVEN MORE POPULAR FILM ABOUT THE BIRDS 
AND PEOPLE OF SAINT KILDA 
THIS OF COURSE WAS LONG BEFORE THE INVENTION OF TELEVISION 
SO PIKE SHOWED HIS FIFTEEN MINUTE MOVIES WHEREVER CINEMAS HAD BEGUN TO SPRING UP 
IN BRITAIN AMERICA AND ACROSS THE EMPIRE 
AND PEOPLE FLOCKED AND PAID TO WONDER AT THEM 
SAINT KILDA ISN'T A COSY PLACE TO FILM EVEN TODAY 
BACK THEN IT WAS REALLY REMOTE 
AND THE CAMERA EQUIPMENT WELL 
IT WASN'T EXACTLY WHAT YOU'D CALL PORTABLE 
THIS IS THE KIND OF EQUIPMENT THAT PIKE WOULD HAVE USED 
IT'S MADE OUT OF FINEST MAHOGANY OR SOME OTHER ENDANGERED TREE NO DOUBT 
BELIEVE ME IT IS INCREDIBLY HEAVY 
YOU FACE IT THE RIGHT WAY BIRDS OVER THERE 
FILM IS IN HERE OF COURSE SPOOL THERE SPOOL THERE IT'S GOING TO GO ROUND AND ROUND 
HOW DOES IT GO ROUND THIS RATHER FETCHING BRASS HANDLE 
THIS IS RATHER NOISY THIS IS THE WAY IT GOES 
SO CHANCES ARE THE FIRST TIME HE DID THAT ALL THE BIRDS WOULD WOAH OUT OF HERE 
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE A MACHINE GUN DOESN'T IT 
SO HE HAD A CUNNING PLAN HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GET THEM USED TO THAT KIND OF NOISE 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO CART HIS CAMERA UP THERE EVERY TIME 
AND NOT ACTUALLY USE ANY FILM IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
SO HERE'S INGENUITY FOR YOU 
HE COLLECTED UP SOME PEBBLES LIKE THIS 
HE'D REMEMBERED TO BRING A TIN CAN PROBABLY HAD BAKED BEANS IN IT 
PEBBLES INTO THE CAN AND HE'D GO UP INTO THE SEA BIRD COLONY AND GO 
AND AFTER 
I IMAGINE SEVERAL DAYS POSSIBLY SEVERAL WEEKS THEY FINALLY GOT USED TO THIS 
OH IT'S JUST THAT NUTTY BLOKE WITH HIS TIN CAN 
SO THE NEXT TIME HE CAME UP WITH HIS CAMERA 
HE PLACED THE CAMERA DOWN BIRDS OVER THERE 
RATTLED HIS TIN CAN 
IT'S ALL RIGHT LADS JUST THE TIN CAN 
THEN HE WOULD STOP THAT AND IMMEDIATELY START DOING THAT 
A SORT OF AURAL SPLICE 
AND THE BIRDS JUST SAT THERE AND THOUGHT IT'S ALL RIGHT WE'RE NOT BEING FILMED IT'S JUST A TIN CAN 
IT WASN'T AND HE GOT SOME TRULY HISTORIC PICTURES 
AW IT'S FLOWN AWAY 
OF COURSE NESTING BIRDS DON'T FLY AWAY 
AND THEY WERE A FAVOURITE SUBJECT 
ALTHOUGH IT WAS STILL A PRECARIOUS BUSINESS FILMING THEM 
IT ALSO REQUIRED A LOT OF INGENUITY AND INDEED 
CAMOUFLAGE 
YEP THAT IS THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF COW CAM RELISHING AND OVERCOMING 
APPARENTLY INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEMS IS ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF A WILDLIFE FILM MAKER 
AND THE MOST INTREPID OF THEM ALL WAS CHERRY KEARTON 
YES IT REALLY IS SURPRISING THAT I SHOULD BE SITTING SAFELY HERE TO TELL THIS STORY 
FOR ONLY BY A SERIES OF MIRACLES HAVE I ESCAPED DEATH AS YOU SHALL SEE 
KEARTON'S DRIVING AMBITION 
WAS TO CAPTURE IMAGES THE WORLD HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE 
HE WAS SOON LURED AWAY FROM BIRDS IN BRITAIN BY FARAWAY AFRICA 
IT WAS IN EAST AFRICA THAT KEARTON DID INDEED MAKE HISTORY 
BY CAPTURING THE FIRST MOVING IMAGES OF AFRICAN ANIMALS 
THE ABILITY SIMPLY TO GET THE SHOTS 
WAS THE BIG THING 
HOW YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER WAS VERY MUCH OF LESS IMPORTANCE 
AND WHAT CHERRY KEARTON DID WAS GET THE SHOTS 
HE GOT AMAZING SHOTS 
NOT ONLY WAS KEARTON THE FIRST TO FILM AFRICA'S WILDLIFE 
BUT HE DID SO AT A TIME WHEN NATIONAL PARKS DIDN'T EVEN EXIST 
AND TELEPHOTO LENSES WERE A THING OF THE FUTURE 
WHAT'S MORE IN THOSE DAYS TRAVEL WAS A VERY FAR FROM EASY 
AS KEARTON'S WIFE ADA EXPLAINS 
I'D NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE AND I WENT ON MY FIRST SAFARI WITH CHERRY 
OF COURSE 
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT IN THOSE DAYS TO WHAT IT IS TODAY 
ALTHOUGH AND THE EARLY DAYS OF CHERRY FOR INSTANCE WHEN HE HAD TO CROSS RIVERS 
AND THAT SORT OF THING HE HAD TO WALK ON FOOT 
BUT HE WENT REALLY IN THE HARD WAY YOU KNOW YES 
HE HAD SUCH A WONDERFUL WAY OF UNDERSTANDING ANIMALS 
I FOUND HIM VERY INTERESTING 
KEARTON COMBINED A LOVE OF WILDLIFE WITH A TASTE FOR ADVENTURE 
AND I THINK THAT'S A COMBINATION THAT MOST WILDLIFE FILM MAKERS HAVE HAD EVER SINCE 
OF COURSE THE ADVENT OF COMMERCIAL AIR TRAVEL 
AND LIGHTER CAMERA EQUIPMENT DID MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BIT EASIER 
NEVERTHELESS GETTING TO SOME REMOTE LOCATIONS WAS AND STILL IS 
PRETTY DIFFICULT 
WHOA 
AND A NINETEEN FIFTY SIX VERSION OF DAVID ATTENBOROUGH AGREES WITH ME 
A MONTH AGO CHARLES LAGUS AND I RETURNED FROM SPENDING FOUR MONTHS IN SEARCH OF A DRAGON 
OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY IN SEARCH OF THE LARGEST LIZARD IN THE WORLD 
IT LIVES ON ONE TINY LITTLE ISLAND IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD AT ALL 
THE NAME OF THE ISLAND IS KOMODO 
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT BEFORE WE STARTED PLANNING THIS EXPEDITION 
I HAD NO IDEA WHERE KOMODO WAS AND HAD TO LOOK FOR IT ON THE MAP 
THE FIRST NIGHT WE WENT ONTO A CORAL REEF BUMPING UP AND DOWN 
THE CAPTAIN WAS ASLEEP SO WE POLED OURSELVES OFF THE CORAL REEF 
THE NEXT NIGHT WE WERE BECALMED 
AND THE NEXT DAY I WENT DOWN TO HIM AND I SAID 
YOU HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE HAVEN'T YOU AND HE SAID 
BLMMM I LOOKED UP AND HE SAID NOT YET YOU SEE 
SO AT LAST WE SAILED SAFELY INTO THE WIDE CALM BAY OF KOMODO 
THIS WAS THE HOME OF THE DRAGON WHICH WE'D COME SO FAR TO SEE 
WITHIN HALF AN HOUR THERE WAS A RUSTLE IN THE BUSH AND THERE WAS THE DRAGON 
HE LOOKED ALMOST AS THOUGH HE HAD WALKED OUT OF SOME PREHISTORIC AGE 
THIS WAS TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING FOR US 
OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THIS MAGNIFICENT MONSTER 
THE CLIMAX OF FOUR MONTHS OF ARDUOUS TRAVEL 
AND GETTING TO 
UNEXPLORED PLACES STILL ISN'T STRAIGHTFORWARD 
AS CAMERAMAN GAVIN THURSTON FOUND OUT 
WHEN HE SET OFF TO FILM LOWLAND GORILLAS IN THE CONGO 
EIGHT HOURS AFTER LEAVING GATWICK 
ARE WE AT THE WRONG AIRPORT YES WE'RE AT THE WRONG AIRPORT 
DAY TWO AND THE CREW MANAGE TO FIND THE RIGHT AIRPORT 
ALL RIGHT JAMES HEADS OR TAILS 
ERM TAILS 
DO WE KNOW WHICH SIDE TAILS ARE YET YEAH 
THAT IS TAILS SO WHERE AM I 
YOU CAN DECIDE I'LL GO IN FRONT 
DAY THREE A SEVENTEEN HOUR DUSTY TRUCK JOURNEY 
IN A VEHICLE THAT ISN'T WELL IT ISN'T EXACTLY A ROLLS ROYCE 
HOW'S THE JOURNEY GUYS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
AND AFTER THAT NONE TOO LUXURIOUS RIDE NOT EVEN A SHOWER 
THEY'RE INTO CANOES FOR A FOURTEEN HOUR TRIP DOWN THE CONGO 
JUST THE BARE ESSENTIALS ON THIS TRIP 
DAY SIX 
JUST WHEN THEY THINK THEY'VE ARRIVED THERE'S STILL THREE HOURS TO GO ON FOOT 
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE A PLEASANT WALK 
SHAME WE HAVE TO CART ALL THIS BLOOMING FILM GEAR WITH US 
WE'VE FINALLY ARRIVED AT THE FIRST OF THE THREE 
AMAZINGLY WE'VE SEEN OUR FIRST SILVERBACK GORILLA 
IT'S ENCOURAGING TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY HERE 
WE'VE SEEN ONE WITHIN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES 
FRANKLY TO SEE THE ANIMAL YOU'RE HOPING TO FILM WITHIN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES 
IS UM A MIRACLE 
IT'S ONE OF THE 
INESCAPABLE FACTS OF WILDLIFE FILMING 
OR INDEED WILDLIFE WATCHING 
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW FAR YOU'VE TRAVELLED OR HOW ARDUOUS THE JOURNEY 
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE WHATSOEVER THAT WHAT YOU'RE HOPING TO SEE WILL TURN UP IMMEDIATELY 
OR WILL TURN UP AT ALL 
SCENE TEN TAKE TWO 
AND I CAN'T SEE A SINGLE HARE 
WELL THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
YOU'VE GOT FIRST OF ALL TO FIND YOUR HARES 
AND THEN TO GET CLOSE TO THEM WITHOUT ALARMING THEM CUT 
THIS IS THE TROPICAL RAINFOREST 
FAMOUS FOR BEING THE RICHEST PROLIFERATION OF LIFE ON EARTH 
SO WHERE ARE THE ANIMALS 
BILL WHAT'S HAPPENING 
WELL I SUPPOSE THE WORD 
THAT WOULD SUM IT UP AT THE MOMENT KATE IS NOTHING 
SIMON YES BILL I'M WITH YOU MATE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL HAPPENING HERE EITHER 
WELL HERE I AM I'M LOOKING AT THE MONITORS 
LOOK AT MY SCREEN HERE 
WE'VE GOT THESE INFRA RED LIGHTS ON VARIOUS THINGS 
AND WHAT HAVE WE GOT UP THERE AT THE MOMENT 
CHANNEL ONE WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
WELL I'LL BE HONEST I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING AT ALL SO I'M NOT GOING TO BOTHER TO SHOW THEM TO YOU 
SOME ANIMALS AREN'T JUST CAMERA SHY 
THEY TAKE ELUSIVENESS TO THE BRINK OF INVISIBILITY 
WHEN CAMERAMAN DOUG ALLEN SET OFF TO FILM SNOW LEOPARDS 
IN THE HIMALAYAS IT CERTAINLY TESTED HIS PATIENCE 
THIS IS TEDIOUS STUFF 
THIS IS THE SEVENTH SESSION THAT I'VE DONE 
I DO THREE HOURS IN THE MORNING THREE HOURS IN THE LATE AFTERNOON 
NOT A SIGN 
IF YOU GOT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF HINT A WEE BIT OF A SIGHTING 
NOW AND AGAIN YOUR SPIRITS WOULD BE LIFTED 
BUT RIGHT NOW 
I'D SWAP A LITTLE BIT OF THIS ANIMAL'S CHARISMA 
FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE VISIBILITY 
AIR ON A G. STRING BY J. S. BACH 
FIVE DAYS 
THAT'S THIRTY FIVE HOURS OF WATCHING 
NOTHING NO CATS 
AFTER SEVEN WEEKS OF WAITING 
DOUG DID GET A GLIMPSE OF THE ELUSIVE SNOW LEOPARD 
BUT SURELY NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE A PROPER SEQUENCE 
IN THE GOBI DESERT THE BACTRIAN CAMELS PROVED TO BE 
ALMOST AS RELUCTANT TO BE FILMED AS THE SNOW LEOPARD 
IT WAS EIGHT DAYS BEFORE THIS CREW GOT THEIR FIRST SIGHTING OF CAMELS 
AND EVEN THEN IT WAS JUST THEIR REAR ENDS DISAPPEARING INTO THE DISTANCE 
ABOUT 
THREE OR FOUR KILOMETRES AWAY THEY SPOTTED US FROM THAT DISTANCE 
THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM GETTING CLOSE 
THEY'RE CAPABLE OF SPOTTING US FROM ABOUT FIVE KILOMETRES 
AND RUNNING FOR SEVENTY K. S. IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION 
SO THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE FILMING INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT 
IT WASN'T UNTIL DAY THIRTY SIX 
THAT THEY GOT PICTURES OF ANYTHING EXCEPT CAMELS RUNNING AWAY 
NOT ONLY DID THEY START GETTING HEAD SHOTS OF CAMELS 
BUT FASCINATING BEHAVIOUR 
STRANGE MATING RITUALS AND SNOW EATING 
WILD CAMELS REMAIN ONE OF OUR PLANET'S LEAST KNOWN ANIMALS SO THIS UNIQUE FOOTAGE 
WAS MUCH NEEDED PUBLICITY FOR A SPECIES ON THE VERGE OF EXTINCTION 
ONE YEAR LATER PROOF THAT WILDLIFE FILMMAKERS DON'T GIVE UP EASILY 
A NEW LOCATION A NEW TEAM AN OLD QUEST THAT ELUSIVE CAT AGAIN 
THIS TIME THEY HAD TO DODGE FALLING BOULDERS 
BUT LUCK WAS ON THEIR SIDE 
WE JUST GOT A REPORT THAT THERE'S A SNOW LEOPARD UP ON THE RIDGE 
WE'RE TOO LOW WHERE WE WERE BEFORE 
JUST TRYING TO GET SOME HEIGHT JUST TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF IT 
AND THERE IT WAS EXACTLY AS THEY'D BEEN TOLD 
MARK WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO SPEND TWO WEEKS FILMING THE INTRICATE BEHAVIOUR OF THIS GORGEOUS LEOPARD 
IN THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS OF PAKISTAN 
BUT MOST EXCITING OF ALL WAS THE SEQUENCE HE MANAGED TO GET ON THE VERY LAST DAY OF FILMING 
THE CAMERAMAN'S DREAM THAT HAPPY COINCIDENCE OF PATIENCE AND LUCK 
MANY OF THE MOST MAGIC MOMENTS FROM WILDLIFE FILMS HAVE BEEN WHEN A CAMERAMAN HAS MANAGED 
TO BRING PICTURES FROM SOMEWHERE WE THOUGHT WAS SURELY IMPOSSIBLE 
WELL IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THERE WAS A GERMAN CAMERAMAN HEINZ SIELMANN 
WHO CHANGED THE DIRECTION OF WILDLIFE FILMS FOREVER 
BECAUSE HE WAS DETERMINED TO SHOW US THINGS NEVER BEFORE SEEN WITH THE NAKED EYE 
FOR EXAMPLE WHAT GOES ON INSIDE A NEST HOLE 
AND THE BIRD HE CHOSE TO DO THIS WITH WAS THE WOODPECKER 
HELLO GOOD EVENING 
NOW HEINZ SIELMANN HAS COME ALL THE WAY FROM MUNICH TO SHOW US THE FILM TONIGHT 
AND SO HERE HE IS AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SEE YOU HERE HEINZ 
WELL I WAS SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING A BLACK WOODPECKER'S NEST 
WHICH WAS NOT HIGHER UP THAN ABOUT TWENTY YARDS 
TWENTY FEET TWENTY FEET PARDON 
THAT'S HIGH ENOUGH ANYWAY OH YES 
TO MAKE A HOLE IN THE BACK OF THE NEST 
HEINZ COULD ONLY CHISEL FOR THIRTY MINUTES EVERY FIVE HOURS 
TO ENSURE THAT THE BIRDS CONTINUED TO INCUBATE 
AFTER TEN DAYS HE PUT IN A PANE OF GLASS SURROUNDED BY A CAMOUFLAGED HIDE 
HE THEN SPENT A FURTHER EIGHT DAYS ACCUSTOMING THE BIRDS TO ELECTRIC LIGHT 
SO THAT'S A TOTAL OF EIGHTEEN DAYS BEFORE GETTING A SINGLE SHOT 
WELL NOW CAN WE SEE THE PICTURES THAT YOU TOOK IN THE BACK OF THE 
I HOPE WE WERE SUCCESSFUL BY THAT WORK YES 
AND BACK IN THE WOOD 
WHERE THE NESTS ARE HERE'S THE BLACK WOODPECKER BRINGING FOOD 
TO ITS NEWLY HATCHED YOUNG AND NOW DOWN SHE GOES 
INSIDE THE NEST 
LIKE FATHER CHRISTMAS COMING DOWN THE CHIMNEY 
SHE WAKES THE YOUNG ONES UP 
AND SHE FEEDS EACH ONE BY REGURGITATION 
OF COURSE THEY'RE BLIND WHEN THEY HATCH OUT 
AND VERY UNDEVELOPED IT THINK IT'S REALLY VERY EXCITING 
TO THINK OF THESE PICTURES THE FIRST PICTURES EVER TAKEN OF WOODPECKERS 
ACTUALLY INSIDE THEIR NESTING HOLE 
WHEN HIS WOODPECKER FILM CAME JUST SUDDENLY INTO OUR LOOK PROGRAMME 
IT REALLY REVOLUTIONISED IT THAT NIGHT 
THE SWITCHBOARD WAS JAMMED FOR AN HOUR OR SO AFTERWARDS 
IT GOT THE BIGGEST APPRECIATION FIGURE THE B. B. C. HAD EVER HAD EXCEPT FOR THE CORONATION 
AND IT POINTED THE WAY 
HEINZ HAD SET A NEW STANDARD FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO FOLLOW 
THE HUGE POPULARITY 
OF HEINZ SIELMANN'S FILMS INDICATED THE PUBLIC'S APPETITE 
FOR SEEING THINGS FROM A NEW ANGLE OR NEW PERSPECTIVE 
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT FOR QUITE SOME TIME 
SOME OF THE VERY BEST PLACES 
AND SOME OF THE MOST INTERESTING WILDLIFE 
WAS QUITE LITERALLY UNFILMABLE 
AND THE REASON IS THAT FILM REQUIRES QUITE A LOT OF LIGHT IN ORDER TO REGISTER AN IMAGE 
AND QUITE A LOT OF WILDLIFE ON THE OTHER HAND 
PREFERS TO LIVE IN PLACES THAT ARE DISTINCTLY MURKY 
THE FIRST TIME WE WENT INTO A RAINFOREST IN WEST AFRICA 
CHARLES LAGUS WHO WAS THE CAMERAMAN LOOKED UP AND SAID 
WELL WE CAN'T FILM THERE'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH LIGHT 
THERE ARE FEW LARGE ANIMALS IN THE WEST AFRICAN FOREST 
AND THE ONLY ONE WE HAVE ANY CHANCE OF SEEING IS A MONKEY 
THERE'S ONE SITTING HIDDEN IN THE TREETOP QUIETLY FEEDING 
SO IN FACT WHAT WE DID WAS TO LARGELY FILM 
JUST VERY WIDE ANGLE SCENES OF JACK TRAMPING AROUND 
AND ALL THE DETAILED CLOSE UPS OF THE ANIMALS WE ACTUALLY DID IN THE STUDIO 
AS MORE AND MORE SENSITIVE FILM STOCK 
WAS DEVELOPED IT WAS NO LONGER NECESSARY TO CHEAT THE SHOTS 
BY NINETEEN NINETY SIR DAVID COULD FILM 
THE SUPERB BIRD OF PARADISE DEEP IN THE TROPICAL UNDERGROWTH 
AND SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER 
THE HIGH DEFINITION CAMERA RENDERED THE SAME BIRD 
CRYSTAL CLEAR 
DANCE OF THE HOURS FROM LA GIOCONDA BY AMILCARE PONCHIELLI 
BUT THERE WAS AN EVEN BIGGER CHALLENGE 
THAN FILMING IN THE HALF LIGHT OF A TROPICAL RAINFOREST 
A HUGE NUMBER OF ANIMALS RATHER INCONVENIENTLY 
ARE ONLY ACTIVE AT NIGHT 
WHEN PRODUCER AMANDA BARRETT AND CAMERAMAN OWEN NEWMAN SET OFF TO FILM LEOPARDS IN THE SERENGETI 
THEY BEGAN BY USING LIGHT SENSITIVE VIDEO CAMERAS 
THAT COULD PRODUCE COLOUR IMAGES 
EVEN WITH LOW LEVELS OF LIGHT FOR EXAMPLE AT DUSK 
BUT THEY SOON DISCOVERED THAT LEOPARDS ONLY LIKE TO HUNT 
WHEN IT'S ABSOLUTELY PITCH DARK 
BECAUSE IT'S THEN THAT THEY'RE INVISIBLE TO THEIR PREY 
SO THE CREW CHANGE PLAN AND THEY BEGAN TO FILM WITH INFRA RED 
INFRA RED CAN ONLY PRODUCE IMAGES IN BLACK AND WHITE 
BUT THE ADVANTAGE IS IT'S INVISIBLE TO WILDLIFE WHICH MEANS 
IT JUST CARRIES ON BEHAVING NATURALLY 
AND THE EXCITING THING WAS AT NIGHT 
THE WAY THEY WERE STALKING IN THE OPEN 
THEY WERE USING THE COVER OF DARKNESS TO CREEP UP ON THE ANIMALS 
THE ANTELOPE WERE USING THEIR EARS AND NOSES TO DETECT 
ANY DANGER THAT WAS OUT THERE 
AND SO THE LEOPARD HAD TO BE INCREDIBLY QUIET 
AND THE FIRST TIME WE SAW A LEOPARD 
STALKING IN THE OPEN PUTTING JUST ONE FOOT DOWN 
IT WOULD TAKE MAYBE TWO MINUTES TO FIND A PLACE 
WHERE ITS FOOT WAS ABLE JUST TO FIND 
A BIT OF GROUND THAT WASN'T RUSTLING 
IT WOULD PUT IT THERE IT WOULD STAY AND ALL THE TIME 
JUST CONCENTRATING ON AHEAD 
IN THEIR EAGERNESS TO SNATCH A KILL 
HYENAS TRY TO SHADOW HUNTING LEOPARDS 
BUT WITH THEIR CLUMSY ATTEMPTS TO FIND THE LEOPARD IN THE DARK 
THEY OFTEN INTERRUPT AND SPOIL A HUNT 
THE INVISIBLE NATURE OF INFRA RED LIGHTS MEANS THAT AT LEAST 
THE FILM MAKERS WON'T BE THE ONES TO SPOIL THE HUNT 
ELEPHANTS MIGHT NOT ENTER THESE CAVES IN KENYA 
IF THEY SENSE A CAMERA CREW INSIDE 
BUT WITH REMOTE INFRA RED CAMERAS DAVID ATTENBOROUGH COULD REMAIN OUT OF SIGHT 
AND STILL FIND OUT WHAT WAS LURING THE ELEPHANTS UNDERGROUND 
IT SOUNDS LIKE DISTANT THUNDER 
IT'S AN ELEPHANT 
EVERY FOOT IS BEING PLACED VERY CAREFULLY 
OH 
HE BUMPED HIS HEAD WELL NO ONE'S PERFECT 
THE PASSAGE HERE IS SO NARROW THE BIG MALE CAN ONLY JUST SQUEEZE THROUGH 
AND NOW I CAN HEAR THAT NOISE 
HE'S USING HIS TUSKS TO CARVE OUT THE SALT 
AND OF COURSE IT'S FALLING TO THE GROUND 
SO WHAT HE DOES NOW IS USE HIS TRUNK 
TO SNIFF IT UP AND THEN BLOW IT INTO HIS MOUTH YOU CAN HEAR THAT TOO 
SO INFRA RED CAMERAS HAVE HELPED DISCOVER WHAT GOES ON 
IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT AND INSIDE CAVES BUT THAT'S NOT ALL 
THEY'VE ALSO REVEALED 
SOME OF THE SECRETS OF THE BEAVER'S PRIVATE LIFE 
NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WENT ON INSIDE THE LODGE DURING WINTER 
SO WHEN THE BEAVERS WERE AWAY 
WE INSTALLED A COUPLE OF INFRA RED CAMERAS IN ORDER TO FIND OUT 
A BRANCH FROM THE FRIDGE IS BEING BROUGHT BACK TO THE LODGE 
FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO FEED ON 
AND ANOTHER 
NO WONDER THEY DON'T NEED TO HIBERNATE WITH THIS INGENIOUS SET UP 
THE LODGE IS WARM AND SAFE 
EVEN IN MIDWINTER AND THE ONLY SIGN OF ACTIVITY 
IN THE SNUG HOME BENEATH THE SNOW IS HOT AIR 
RISING FROM THE VENT AT THE TOP 
INSIDE OUR CAMERAS CATCH A GLIMPSE OF WHAT AT FIRST SIGHT 
LOOKS LIKE A VERY SMALL BEAVER 
IT'S A MUSKRAT 
THERE ARE A PAIR OF THEM IN HERE 
THIS IS A NEW OBSERVATION 
DO THE BEAVERS ACTUALLY KNOW IN THE PITCH BLACKNESS THAT THERE ARE STRANGERS AMONG THEM 
WE NOTICE THAT THE MUSKRATS REGULARLY LEFT THE LODGE 
TO FORAGE UNDER THE ICE 
AND ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THEY RETURNED A FEW MINUTES LATER 
WITH A LOAD OF FRESH REEDS 
PERHAPS THE MUSKRATS ARE PAYING RENT 
BY REGULARLY PROVIDING FRESH BEDDING FOR THE LODGE 
MAYBE THAT IS WHY THE BEAVERS ACCEPT THEM 
AND EVEN ALLOW THEM TO SHARE THEIR FOOD 
OUR INFRA RED LIGHTS HOWEVER ARE NO LONGER WELCOME IT SEEMS 
THE FACT IS WITH EVER ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY YOU CAN FILM JUST ABOUT ANYTHING 
IF IT'S DARK NIGHT CAMERA JUST A LONG WAY AWAY TELEPHOTO LENS 
AND IF IT'S VERY VERY SMALL WELL TIME WAS 
YOU'D HAVE TO USE A MICROSCOPE 
BUT THE WORLD OF MICROSCOPES AND CAMERAS WAS BEGINNING TO CONVERGE 
OOH THERE YOU GO 
ONE OF THE FIRST TO TRY HIS HAND WITH MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY WAS PIONEERING CAMERAMAN PERCY SMITH 
THE TROUBLE WAS THE LENSES NEEDED TO MAGNIFY 
SUCH TINY CREATURES REQUIRED AN AWFUL LOT OF LIGHT 
AND LIGHTS ARE HOT SO TO PUT NOT TOO FINE A POINT ON IT 
THE HEAT OFTEN FRIED THE INSECTS HE WAS TRYING TO FILM 
SO SOME CLEVER BODS AT OXFORD SCIENTIFIC FILMS 
GERALD THOMPSON AND ERIC SKINNER DEVISED A WAY 
OF DEFUSING HEAT GIVEN OFF FROM THEIR MASSIVE LIGHTS 
SO THAT THEY COULD FILM TINY INSECTS WITHOUT COOKING THEM 
BASICALLY THEY CREATED A COOLING SYSTEM 
WITH A FLASK OF WATER AND SOME GLASS HEAT FILTERS 
HAVING DONE THAT THEY COULD GET IMAGES LIKE THESE 
AH LOVELY 
YES 
JOLLY GOOD 
TODAY THE HIGH DEFINITION CAMERA IS SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO FILM ANIMALS 
AS SMALL AS INSECTS 
WITH MINIMAL LIGHT 
AND LENSES CAN NOW BE SMALLER THAN A FINGERNAIL 
COMBINE THAT WITH A MOTION CONTROL SYSTEM LIKE THIS ONE DESIGNED BY CAMERAMAN MARTIN DAWN 
AND WE CAN SEE INSECTS ON THEIR LEVEL AND GET A REAL SENSE 
OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN THEIR WORLD 
YOU GET A LOVELY SENSE OF MOTION 
A SENSE OF TRACKING 
YOU CAN YOU KNOW FLYING IN A HELICOPTER AT THE MOMENT 
OVER THESE EXTRAORDINARY GIGANTIC PLANTS 
IT'S JUST GIVEN ME AND HOPEFULLY OTHERS 
A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE WORLD 
A MINIATURE WORLD INHABITED BY ANIMALS SMALLER THAN A PINHEAD 
THEY ARE TINY 
THIS MINUTE LITTLE CREATURE IS A SPRINGTAIL 
IT IS LESS THAN HALF A MILLIMETRE LONG 
THE SIZE OF A FULL STOP 
DRYING OUT IS A VERY REAL DANGER FOR THEM AND SOME WATERPROOF THEMSELVES 
REGULARLY WITH A DROPLET OF SPECIAL GROOMING FLUID 
YOU MIGHT EVEN SAY THAT THEY HAVE TURNED BATHING 
INTO AN ART FORM 
THEY EVEN HAVE TWO INFLATABLE TUBES THAT ENABLE THEM TO GET TO 
THOSE HARD TO REACH PLACES 
TO HELP THEM GET AROUND THROUGH THE LEAF LITTER THESE SPRINGTAILS 
AS THEIR NAME SUGGESTS HAVE A RATHER NOVEL WAY OF JUMPING 
THEY HAVE A TINY TWO PRONGED LEVER 
BENEATH THEIR ABDOMEN 
ONE SMALL FLICK FROM IT CAN CATAPULT THEM 
SIX INCHES SOME FIFTEEN CENTIMETRES 
INTO THE AIR 
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF A HUMAN BEING JUMPING OVER THE EIFFEL TOWER 
AND IF THEY HAPPEN TO LAND UPSIDE DOWN 
WELL 
THEY HAVE A SPECIAL WAY OF RIGHTING THEMSELVES 
THEY USE THEIR GROOMING FLUID DISPENSER TO STICK ON TO THE GROUND 
SO THAT THEY CAN PULL THEMSELVES BACK ONTO THEIR FEET 
ONE OF THE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS OF MACRO TECHNOLOGY 
HAS BEEN THAT IT HAS MADE VISIBLE FASCINATING AND EVEN ENDEARING 
SOME OF THOSE CREATURES THAT PEOPLE FIND 
WELL NOT EXACTLY ATTRACTIVE OR POSITIVELY SCARY 
TALKING OF SCARY THERE IS ONE HABITAT OR MAYBE I SHOULD SAY ENVIRONMENT 
THAT I PERSONALLY ADMIT DO FIND A TEENY BIT TERRIFYING 
BUT OTHER PEOPLE FIND IT A VAST AND WONDROUS CHALLENGE 
I AM TALKING OF COURSE OF UNDERWATER 
AS EARLY AS NINETEEN THIRTEEN AN AMERICAN 
JOHN ERNEST WILLIAMSON WAS ALREADY HAVING A GO 
HE EVEN TOOK HIS BABY DAUGHTER DOWN TO SHOW 
JUST HOW SAFE IT WAS 
A THIRTY F. T. TUBE CONNECTING THE DIVING BELL TO THE SURFACE 
GAVE WILLIAMSON A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF AIR 
FILMING THROUGH A GLASS WINDOW HE BROUGHT BACK THE FIRST MOVING IMAGES 
ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN OF LIFE UNDERWATER 
THE DRAWBACK WAS EVERYTHING HAD TO HAPPEN RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW 
OTHERWISE HE MISSED IT 
IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES GERMAN FILM MAKER HANS HASS 
CAME UP WITH A METHOD OF FILMING UNDERWATER 
AND MOVING AT THE SAME TIME 
SO FAR WE HAD ONLY BEEN DOING NATURAL DIVING 
BUT I HAD EQUIPMENT FOR TWO ALTERNATIVES TO THIS 
AND I WANTED TO PUT THESE TO THE TEST 
THE FIRST WAS AN AIR PUMP WITH A PIPELINE LEADING TO A DIVING HELMET 
IT WAS MADE OF A TRANSPARENT PLASTIC 
AND SIMPLY STOOD ON THE WEARER'S SHOULDERS 
ALFRED WAS TO TRY IT FIRST AND HANS WAS TO PUMP 
MOVEMENT WAS LIMITED BECAUSE THE AIR SUPPLY WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE BOAT 
I WENT TO SEE HOW ALFRED WAS MAKING OUT AND HE SEEMED VERY HAPPY INDEED 
HANS PUMPED AWAY IN THE BOAT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME ALFRED WAS NOT AT THE MERCY OF HIS LUNGS 
HE COULD BREATHE AS EASILY AS IF HE WERE ON LAND 
AND SO LONG AS HE KEPT WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE AIR TUBE 
COULD WANDER AT WILL ON THE BED OF THE SEA 
MY SECOND PIECE OF APPARATUS WAS MUCH MORE EXCITING 
AND I RESOLVED TO GIVE NO ONE BUT MYSELF 
THE PLEASURE OF GOING BELOW WITH THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IT WAS A LIGHTWEIGHT OXYGEN EQUIPMENT 
ONE OF THE EARLIEST EVER MADE XENOPHON HELPED ME TO PUT IT ON 
JUST AS ONE'S FIRST GLIMPSE OF A FOREIGN LAND ONE'S FIRST FLIGHT 
ONE'S FIRST LOVE REMAINS FOREVER IMPLANTED IN THE MEMORY 
SO DOES MY FIRST UNDERWATER EXPLORATION 
WITH PORTABLE OXYGEN EQUIPMENT 
GONE IS EVERY SHACKLE GONE IS THE TYRANNY OF THE LUNGS 
THE DEADLY OPPRESSION THAT FORCES YOU TO SURFACE 
EVERY MINUTE OR TWO JUST WHEN THE MOST EXCITING VISTAS ARE OPENING BEFORE YOUR EYES 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PORTABLE AIR TANK WAS TO REVOLUTIONISE UNDERWATER FILMING 
IT FREED UP THE CAMERAMAN TO MOVE AROUND AT WILL 
INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR WILDLIFE TO COME TO HIM HE COULD GO TO THEM 
SINCE THE FIRST ATTEMPTS WITH DIVING BELLS AND AIR PUMPS 
UNDERWATER FILMING HAS SURPASSED ALL EXPECTATION 
OF COURSE WE LIKE TO SEE FILMS ABOUT THE ANIMALS WE LIKE BEST 
AND IT SEEMS WE CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE ONES THAT REMIND US OF OURSELVES 
THE ONES THAT WALK LIKE US 
THE ONES THAT LOOK LIKE US 
AND WE TEND TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP OF ASSUMING THAT THEY PROBABLY THINK LIKE US 
MAYBE HAVE EMOTIONS LIKE US 
EVEN BEHAVE LIKE US 
BUT OF COURSE WE CAN'T RESIST THE CUTE AND THE CUDDLY 
AND WE ALSO LOVE THE FRISSON OF THE BIG AND SCARY 
FOR PROGRAMMES TO SELL WELL ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET THEY MUST HAVE UNIVERSAL APPEAL 
SO WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS FOR A SUCCESSFUL BLOCKBUSTER T. V. SERIES 
WELL EXCITEMENT ACTION MARVELLOUS PICTURES WONDERFUL SOUND YEAH 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A SHOCK TO THE PRODUCERS AT THE B. B. C. NATURAL HISTORY UNIT 
WHEN IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES DAVID ATTENBOROUGH SUGGESTED THE SUBJECT FOR HIS NEXT SERIES 
WE HEARD THAT DAVID HAD AN IDEA 
HE WANTED TO COME UP WITH HIS NEXT SERIES 
AND I WAS THINKING ON THE SAME LINES SO WE WENT TO HIS HOUSE 
DAVID HAS ALWAYS LISTENED TO OUR IDEA 
AND HE NODDED AND WAS VERY COMPLIMENTARY ABOUT IT AND HE SAID 
I WAS THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING A BIT BOLDER 
AND BY THE END OF LUNCH WE HAD ALL SIGNED UP TO DO SIX HOURS ON PLANTS 
I REMEMBER COMING DOWN THE MOTORWAY BACK TO BRISTOL 
SUDDENLY WE ALL LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THOUGHT MY GOD 
WE'VE AGREED WITH DAVID TO DO SIX HOURS ON PLANTS 
A SERIES APTLY CALLED THE PRIVATE LIFE OF PLANTS 
IT WAS SUCH A RIDICULOUS IDEA TO TRY AND BRING TO THE B. B. C. ONE AUDIENCE THINGS THAT DON'T MOVE 
BUT IT ENDED UP REALLY CAPTURING PEOPLE'S IMAGINATION 
STRANGE THOUGH IT MAY SEEM 
SOME PLANTS CAN MOVE NOT JUST THEIR FLOWERS AND THEIR LEAVES 
BUT THEY CAN TRAVEL FROM PLACE TO PLACE 
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THIS BRAMBLE 
PUT BRAMBLES INTO FAST FORWARD AND THEY TAKE ON A LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
INSTEAD OF TAKING TWENTY FIVE PICTURES A SECOND AS FILM CAMERAS DO 
THE PROCESS OF TIME LAPSE TAKES PICTURES MUCH LESS FREQUENTLY 
WHEN THE IMAGE IS PLAYED BACK THIS IS THE RESULT 
WE SEE A WORLD WE ARE NORMALLY BLIND TO BECAUSE WE'RE MOVING AT A VERY DIFFERENT PACE 
APART FROM SHOWING PLANTS IN A NEW LIGHT 
TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY HAS ALSO REVEALED FASCINATING RELATIONSHIPS IN THE NATURAL WORLD 
WHEN FILMING A PRIVATE LIFE OF PLANTS IN BORNEO 
THE CREW NOTED THAT THE LEAVES OF THE GINGER PLANT WERE HEAVILY DAMAGED 
LOOK AT THIS CLEARLY IT IS A BADLY DAMAGED LEAF 
BUT WHERE IS THE CREATURE THAT IS DOING THE DAMAGE 
BY SPEEDING UP EVENTS WE COULD FIND OUT JUST WHAT WAS GOING ON 
THIS IS IT A TINY CATERPILLAR 
IT'S SOFT IT'S DEFENCELESS 
IT'S CLEARLY AN EXCELLENT MOUTHFUL FOR MANY A BIRD 
SO IF IT IS TO SURVIVE IT HAS TO TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT ITSELF 
IT STARTS BY MAKING A SEMICIRCULAR CUT INTO THE LEAF FROM THE MARGIN 
BUT WHEN THE CUT IS ONLY HALF COMPLETE IT STARTS FROM THE OTHER END 
IT SPINS SILK ACROSS THE HINGE 
THAT AS IT DRIES CONTRACTS AND HELPS THE CATERPILLAR PULL OVER THE SEGMENT TO FORM A ROOF 
TO MAKE ITS TENT A LITTLE MORE COMMODIOUS IT CUTS A PLEAT 
PULLS IT ACROSS AND NOW IT IT'S GOT A LITTLE WIGWAM 
THE WHOLE PROCESS ONLY TAKES A FEW HOURS AND IS USUALLY DONE AT NIGHT WHEN THERE ARE NO BIRDS AROUND 
NOW THE CATERPILLAR CAN FEED IN SAFETY 
SHAVING OFF THE SOFT SURFACE LAYERS OF THE LEAF OUT OF THE SIGHT OF ANY HUNGRY BIRD 
AND AT SIGNIFICANT COST TO THE PLANT 
WHILST PLANTS NEED SPEEDING UP FOR US TO SEE WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON 
MOST ANIMALS CAN BE APPRECIATED BETTER BY SLOWING THEM DOWN 
ITS TORPEDO SHAPE STRONG JAWS AND AWESOME MUSCLE POWER 
MAKE THE GREAT WHITE THE MOST POWERFUL OF ALL PREDATORY SHARKS 
IT'S THE LION OF THE OCEAN 
AS EARLY AS NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR A FILM ABOUT GANNETS 
USED THE TECHNIQUE OF SLOW MOTION TO SHOW FOR THE FIRST TIME 
EXACTLY HOW THESE BIRDS WERE USING THEIR WINGS TO LAND 
WHEN LANDING THE GANNET SEEMS TO JUST FLOP DOWN ANYHOW 
BUT SLOW MOTION REVEALS CONTROLLED POWER 
THE TAIL SPREAD AS A BRAKE THE WINGS BEATING BACKWARDS 
TO REDUCE THE SPEED THE FEET OUTSTRETCHED TO TAKE THE SHOCK 
THEY MUST LAND EXACTLY ON THEIR OWN NEST 
OR THEY'LL BE PECKED AND HARRIED BY THE BIRDS THROUGH WHOSE TERRITORIES THEY PASS 
HERE'S THE PERFECT LANDING 
THIS REVELATION WON THE FILM MAKERS THE U. S. ACADEMY AWARD 
NOW KNOWN AS THE OSCAR FOR BEST ONE REEL SHORT SUBJECT 
SLOW MOTION SHOWS THE FULL BEAUTY AND STRENGTH OF THEIR FLIGHT 
AT THAT TIME IT WAS ONLY POSSIBLE TO FILM AT A SLIGHTLY HIGHER SPEED THAN NORMAL BUT TODAY 
SPECIALISED VIDEO CAMERAS CAN SLOW DOWN ACTION AS MUCH AS ONE THOUSAND TIMES TURNING SECONDS INTO MINUTES 
THIS WAS A TECHNIQUE USED IN THE B. B. C. SERIES ANIMAL CAMERA 
THE MANTIS SHRIMP VORACIOUS HUNTER OF THE CORAL REEFS WITH PROBABLY THE FASTEST PUNCH OF ANY ANIMAL 
DEVASTATING TO EVEN THE HARDEST SNAILS 
HOW THE SHRIMP GENERATES THE FORCE TO DO THIS 
HAS BAFFLED SCIENTISTS FOR YEARS UNTIL NOW THAT IS 
BY COMBINING THE SLOW MOTION CAMERA WITH AN UNDERWATER FORCE METER 
WE CAN FINALLY SEE THE ASTONISHING TRUTH 
THE METER SHOWS THE SHRIMP'S PUNCH PACKS A STAGGERING SIXTY KILOGRAMS OF FORCE 
NOT SO MUCH A PUNCH 
AS A HAMMER BLOW 
THIS HUGE IMPACT IS ALL DOWN TO THE SHEER SPEED OF THE STRIKE 
GAME OVER 
IN ONE THOUSANDTH OF A SECOND 
THE SPEED COMES FROM COMPRESSING THIS PART OF THE CLAW 
AND STORING ENERGY WHICH IS RELEASED IN THIS EXPLOSIVE BURST 
WITH THE ACCELERATION OF A BULLET 
THE CAMERA ALSO REVEALED ANOTHER AMAZING EVENT 
FLASHES OF LIGHT 
MOMENTS BEFORE IMPACT A PRESSURE WAVE IN FRONT OF THE CLAW CAUSES THE WATER TO BOIL 
THE STEAM IMMEDIATELY IMPLODES GENERATING LIGHT HEAT AND POSSIBLY ADDING TO THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCE 
SLOW MOTION MAY GIVE US INSIGHTS INTO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR BUT ABOVE ALL 
IT'S A MAGICAL WAY TO SEE THE NATURAL WORLD 
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE MAIN APPEAL OF WILDLIFE FILMS IS VISUAL 
STUNNING PICTURES THAT TRANSPORT US TO A DIFFERENT MAGICAL WORLD 
A WORLD IN WHICH HUMAN BEINGS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A BIT OF AN INTRUSION 
BUT BACK IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES UNDOUBTEDLY THE BIG ADVANCEMENT IN THE WORLD OF MOTION PICTURES 
WAS THE COMING OF THE TALKIES 
AND WILDLIFE FILM MAKERS COULD HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO STICK TO MAKING SILENT FILMS 
THEY WANTED TO GET IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS AND SOME DID 
FROM BRITAIN THERE WAS CHERRY KEARTON FROM AMERICA THERE WAS MARTIN AND O. S. A. JOHNSON 
AND THEY HAD VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES WHICH TOLD US SOMETHING 
ABOUT DIFFERENT ATTITUDES TO WILDLIFE BACK IN THOSE DAYS 
MARTIN AND O. S. A. JOHNSON HAD A RATHER UM SHOWBIZ APPROACH TO PRESENTING 
MORE HOLLYWOOD THAN DOCUMENTARY THE EMPHASIS IN THEIR FILMS WAS ON THEM 
THE ANIMALS WERE SIMPLY PROPS WHILST THEY ACTED OUT THEIR DRAMAS 
NOW ONE OF THE RHINOS HAS DISCOVERED MARTIN AND O. S. A. WITH THEIR CAMERAS 
SLOWLY THE GREAT BEAST COMES ON HIS HUGE HORN MENACING 
IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS GREAT ENTERTAINMENT TO SEE ANIMALS BEING SHOT 
MINUTES SEEM LIKE HOURS TO O. S. A. AS SHE TRAINS HER GUN ON THE ANIMAL 
WAITING UNTIL HE IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO MAKE A BULLET EFFECTIVE 
CALLING ON ALL HER SKILL FOR AN AIM THAT WILL BE TRUE 
CLOSER AND CLOSER HE COMES 
HUNTING SAFARIS WERE AT THEIR HEIGHT 
AND IT WAS A TIME WHEN THE WEST SAW NATURE AS SOMETHING NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD BUT TO BE CONQUERED 
O. S. A. LETS GO ANOTHER BULLET AND THE RHINO REARS INTO THE AIR 
AND THRASHES MADLY ABOUT FOR A SECOND AND THEN DROPS DEAD IN HIS TRACKS 
THE JOHNSONS EMPLOYED HOLLYWOOD TECHNIQUES LIKE BACK PROJECTION TO ADD TO THE DRAMA 
CLOSER AND CLOSER GOES THE BOAT ALERT FOR WHATEVER MOVE THE CROC MAY MAKE 
AND THERE IT COMES THERE'S A SUDDEN LUNGE AND HE THROWS HIMSELF STRAIGHT AT THE BOAT 
PHEW THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE THE PARTY IS ALL SAFE 
WELL THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR THAT'S FOR SURE 
THERE'S A MEAN LOOK IN THOSE EYES AND SHE'S ABOUT MADE UP HER MIND TO CHARGE THE BOAT 
NO SHE'S USED HER WOMAN'S PRIVILEGE AND CHANGED HER MIND 
YES WELL IN FACT THEIR PATRONISING ATTITUDE TO ANIMALS 
WASN'T DISSIMILAR TO THEIR ATTITUDE TO PEOPLE 
HUMAN MONKEYS 
THEY'RE A TRIBE OF NATIVES WHOSE HOMES AND HIGHWAYS ARE IN THE TALL TREES 
WATCH OUT THERE BOY THAT'S A DEAD END STREET 
AT ABOUT THIS TIME I SAID TO O. S. A. LET'S GIVE THE BOYS AND GIRLS SOME MODERN JAZZ 
YES WELL THEY WERE NEITHER ZOOLOGISTS OR ANTHROPOLOGISTS 
IN FACT MARTIN JOHNSON WAS NORMALLY A COOK AND O. S. A. A CABARET DANCER 
A CAREER WHICH HE CLEARLY WISHED TO CONTINUE 
THEIR CONDESCENDING APPROACH WOULD BE CONSIDERED COMPLETELY OUTRAGEOUS TODAY OF COURSE 
BUT IN AMERICA THEY WERE THE MOST CELEBRATED WILDLIFE FILM MAKERS OF THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY 
THEY MADE ABOUT THIRTY VERY POPULAR MOVIES BEFORE NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN 
WHEN MARTIN JOHNSON WAS KILLED IN A PLANE CRASH IN L. A. 
AND IT WAS WITH DEEP REGRET THAT WE SAID GOODBYE TO THE HAPPIEST LITTLE SAVAGES ON EARTH 
IN CONTRAST TO THE JOHNSONS 
BRITAIN'S FIRST WILDLIFE PRESENTER CHERRY KEARTON 
WAS KEEN TO MAKE HIS SUBJECTS NOT HIMSELF THE CENTRE OF THE SHOW 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LET ME PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY AT ONCE 
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE ME FOR LONG 
ALTHOUGH I'M INVITING YOU TO COME ON THIS TRIP WITH ME YOU WILL ONLY SEE ME OCCASIONALLY 
FOR MY STORY OF PENGUIN ISLAND 
IS ABOUT THE STRANGEST LITTLE CREATURES 
THAT BEAR A REMARKABLE RESEMBLANCE TO HUMAN BEINGS 
AT FIRST SIGHT THEY LOOK LIKE MILLIONS OF TINY CHARLIE CHAPLINS 
AT LEAST ABOUT THE FEET 
KEARTON'S STYLE WAS NOT ONLY SELF EFFACING 
IT WAS UNDENIABLY ANTHROPOMORPHIC AND IF YOU LIKE POPULARIST 
BUT THIS WAS PARTLY BECAUSE BACK IN THOSE DAYS THERE WASN'T VERY MUCH SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE 
THE FACT IS THOUGH KEARTON HAD A GENUINE LOVE FOR AND INTEREST IN ANIMALS 
I RESTED FOR A WHILE ON THE TERRACE WATCHING A FEW THOUSANDS OF MY NEIGHBOURS 
GOING ABOUT EACH OTHER'S BUSINESS 
BEFORE LONG I REALISED THAT UNLESS I KEPT A CLOSE WATCH ON MY BELONGINGS I'D FEEL THE PINCH 
FOR PINCHING WAS A RECOGNISED PROFESSION IN THIS LAND 
A SORT OF WHAT'S YOURS IS MINE IF YOU'RE NOT LOOKING PRINCIPLE 
OF COURSE FOR THE FILMMAKER TO BE IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA 
SOMEBODY ELSE HAD TO BE BEHIND IT 
IN KEARTON'S CASE IT WAS HIS WIFE ADA 
AM I RIGHT THAT WHEN YOU WERE MARRIED YOU GAVE UP YOUR SINGING CAREER ALTOGETHER 
OH YES I DID BUT I THINK YOU'VE BEEN WONDERING I GAVE IT UP 
YES WELL BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY SINGERS BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE CHERRY KEARTON 
HE WAS A FREELANCE PERFORMER 
HE HAD A PASSION FOR WILDLIFE OF COURSE BUT HE HAD TO AS IT WERE SELL IT TO AN AUDIENCE 
AND HE SOLD IT THROUGH HIS OWN PERSONALITY 
IN NINETEEN FORTY CHERRY KEARTON DIED SUDDENLY AS HE LEFT THE B. B. C.'S BROADCASTING HOUSE IN LONDON 
HE WAS ONE OF THE GREAT PIONEERS 
HE WAS AS GOOD AS ANYBODY IN HIS TIME AND I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AHEAD OF ALMOST EVERYBODY 
AND CERTAINLY IN TERMS OFF AFFECTING HIS AUDIENCE 
INCLUDING SMALL BOYS LIKE ME HE WAS OUT THERE ON HIS OWN 
REALLY THIS IS A WONDERFUL SIGHT 
FIVE MILLION PENGUINS SURROUNDING ME BRAYING THEIR NATIONAL ANTHEM AND CHEERING ME ON MY WAY 
I AM FILLED WITH SADNESS AT LEAVING 
KEARTON MANAGED TO COMBINE AUTHORITATIVE INSIGHT INTO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 
WITH ENTERTAINING AN AUDIENCE 
AND THAT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE QUALIFIES HIM AS THE RIGHTFUL FOUNDER OF WILDLIFE FILM MAKING 
RATHER IRONICALLY THOUGH KEARTON'S DEATH COINCIDED WITH THE BIRTH OF TELEVISION 
THE MEDIUM OF COURSE IN WHICH WILDLIFE PRESENTERS POSITIVELY PROLIFERATED 
IRONICALLY THOUGH SHORTLY AFTER ITS ARRIVAL T. V. SHUT DOWN FOR THE DURATION OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL NINETEEN FIFTY THREE THAT WILDLIFE PROGRAMMES FIRST APPEARED ON THE TELLY 
THE NEW PRESENTERS ADDED AUTHORITY AND INFORMATION TO THEIR FILMS CHANGING THE FOCUS AWAY 
FROM PURE ENTERTAINMENT PERHAPS IN RESPONSE TO THE POST WAR RESOLUTION 
TO REBUILD BRITAIN THROUGH EDUCATION 
FIRST AND FOREMOST WAS SIR PETER SCOTT 
PETER SCOTT WAS THE SON OF THE FAMOUS ANTARCTIC EXPLORER CAPTAIN SCOTT 
WHO DIED WHEN PETER WAS FIVE MONTHS OLD 
IT WAS HIS FATHER'S DYING WISH THAT HIS SON WOULD BE INTERESTED IN WILDLIFE 
MY FATHER REALLY WANTED ME TO BE INTERESTED IN NATURAL HISTORY 
AND HE WROTE A MESSAGE TO MY MOTHER IN THE TENT WHERE HE DIED IN THE ANTARCTIC 
WHICH GOT FOUND THE NEXT SPRING WHEN THEY WERE THERE 
AND IT WAS A LETTER IN WHICH HE SAID MAKE THE BOY INTERESTED IN NATURAL HISTORY 
IT IS BETTER THAN GAMES 
THEY TEACH IT AT SOME SCHOOLS 
HIS FATHER'S WISHES WERE MOST CERTAINLY GRANTED 
PETER SCOTT WAS TO BECOME KNIGHTED FOR HIS WORK IN CONSERVATION 
HE SET UP THE WORLD WILDLIFE FUND AND HE SOLD MANY OF HIS PAINTINGS TO RAISE MONEY 
AND HE ALMOST SINGLE HANDEDLY SAVED THIS SPECIES 
THE HAWAIIAN GOOSE FROM EXTINCTION AND THEY'RE VERY GRATEFUL 
WHAT'S MORE PETER SCOTT PRESENTED THE VERY FIRST WILDLIFE TELEVISION PROGRAMME 
AND HE DID IT LIVE FROM SLIMBRIDGE IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE 
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHERE I AM NOW 
WHILST HE'S DOING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU ONE OR TWO BIRDS THAT WE'VE GOT ON THE WATER HERE 
HERE ARE SOME RED BREASTED GEESE 
IN FACT IRONICALLY PETER HAD STARTED OFF AS A WILDFOWLER ONE OF THE TOP PUNT GUNNERS OF HIS DAY 
I'M BOUND TO SAY THAT I PASSED THROUGH A PERIOD AND I DON'T 
I HATE REMEMBERING IT 
BUT I DON'T WANT TO COVER IT UP 
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE 
THERE WAS A TIME 
WHEN I REALLY TOOK A GREAT DELIGHT 
IN SUCCESSFULLY ER KILLING 
I HATE TO THINK IT WAS SO 
BUT IT WAS SO 
SCOTT SERVED IN THE ROYAL NAVY DURING WORLD WAR TWO AND HE WAS TWICE DECORATED FOR BRAVERY 
BUT LIKE MANY HUNTERS ONCE WAR WAS OVER HE TURNED HIS BACK ON SHOOTING 
WHEN HE CAME TO SLIMBRIDGE WILDFOWLING WAS STILL GOING ON HERE 
AND HE SAW A FEMALE GOOSE WOUNDED FEMALE GOOSE 
LYING OUT ON THE SANDS AND THE MALE STANDING BY IT FOR HOURS ON END 
AND I THINK HE THOUGHT THAT WASN'T VERY NICE AND HE DECIDED HE WASN'T GOING TO DO ANY MORE SHOOTING 
HELLO GOOD EVENING 
HIS BEST KNOWN SERIES LOOK LIKE OTHER PROGRAMMES AT THIS TIME WAS BROADCAST LIVE FROM A STUDIO 
TELEVISION CAMERAS IN THE FIFTIES WERE FAR TOO CUMBERSOME TO BE TAKEN INTO THE FIELD 
MARVELLOUS NOW ON YOUR MARKS GET SET GO 
NOW DON'T GO DO YOU WANT TO GET OUT COME ON 
IT RAN FOR TWELVE YEARS SURPRISING EVERYONE BY ITS POPULARITY NOT LEAST SCOTT HIMSELF 
NOBODY BELIEVED NATURAL HISTORY WAS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO LOOK AT 
AND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY WHEN IT TOOK OFF 
IT BECAME ENORMOUSLY EXCITING BECAUSE THEN ONE SUDDENLY REALISED 
MY GOODNESS WE'RE GETTING TO ALL THESE PEOPLE 
THIS IS WHAT I'D BEEN DREAMING ABOUT 
AND THEN IT REALLY WAS VERY EXCITING 
A NICE RESTFUL JOB SNAIL WATCHING 
WHAT PETER SCOTT WAS BECOMING THE FACE OF BRITISH WILDLIFE PROGRAMMES 
COMPETITION WAS BEGINNING TO APPEAR IN THE REST OF EUROPE 
HERE VE SEE HEINZ SIELMANN ENGAGED IN A LIFE OR DEATH STRUGGLE VITH PETER SCOTT 
THEY ARE ENGAGED IN A BITTER PUNCH UP OVER REPEAT FEES 
AND THE OVERSEAS SALES OF THEIR NATURE DOCUMENTARIES 
NOW THEY HAVE BEEN JOINED BY AN ENRAGED JACQUES COUSTEAU 
ZIS IS TYPICAL OF THE HARSH AND BITCHY VORLD OF TELEVISION FEATURES 
THE DASHING FRENCHMAN JACQUES COUSTEAU WAS BECOMING THE FACE OF UNDERWATER FILMS 
WITH CUTTING EDGE IMAGES LIKE THESE 
NIGHT AND DAY HEAD TO TAIL IN LOCKSTEP THE SPINY LOBSTERS MARCH 
ALONGSIDE THE ALREADY KNOWN AUSTRIAN FILM MAKER HANS HASS 
WHO HAD NOW TEAMED UP WITH HIS WIFE LOTTE 
ON THIS MY FIRST DIVE WITH OXYGEN I MET AND PHOTOGRAPHED A SHARK 
LIKE PETER SCOTT HANS HAD ALSO BEEN A KEEN HUNTER 
BUT HE AND LOTTE BEGAN TO REFLECT THE POST WAR FEELING OF THE TIME 
I DISCOVERED HOW MUCH MORE EXCITING AND HOW MUCH MORE USEFUL IT WOULD BE 
IF INSTEAD OF KILLING THESE TRUSTING DEFENCELESS CREATURES 
I COULD PHOTOGRAPH THEM IN THEIR NATURAL SURROUNDINGS 
I DON'T LIKE KILLING FISH EITHER 
UNTIL NEXT TIME THEN 
O. K. NEXT TIME GOODBYE 
AND WHILST THESE PRESENTERS BECAME LINKED WITH UNDERWATER FILMS 
ANOTHER HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM BECAME THE FACES OF FILMS ABOUT AFRICAN WILDLIFE 
ARMAND AND MICHAELA DENIS FROM BELGIUM 
THE SEARCH FOR GERTIE 
AND IT IS THE SEARCH FOR GERTIE WHICH BROUGHT US TO AMBOSELI 
YOU HAD BETTER EXPLAIN WHO GERTIE IS OH YES 
HERE IT IS A FEMALE RHINOCEROS 
WELL THEY STARTED AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME TIME AS I DID NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR 
AND THEY HAD LIVED IN EAST AFRICA FOR YEARS 
AND THEY HAD BEEN FILMING ON SIXTEEN M. M. 
THEY HAD DECADES OF FILM MATERIAL AVAILABLE 
SO MUCH BETTER TO LEAVE EAST AFRICA TO THEM WHO LIVED THERE AND CONCENTRATE ON ELSEWHERE 
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT DAVID DID AND CONTINUES TO DO 
HERE IN THE TINY COMORO ISLANDS 
HERE IN THE TROPICAL RAINFOREST OF SUMATRA 
SIX FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH 
TWO HUNDRED MILES SOUTH OF JAVA 
FINE ASH IS FALLING ALL AROUND 
AT NIGHT IT GETS SO COLD THAT IT CAN FREEZE 
THAT MAKES THIS THE DEEPEST VALLEY IN THE WORLD 
THIS IS ONE OF THE COLDEST PLACES ON EARTH 
HERE THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO WATER AT ALL 
THIS IS ONE OF THE WETTEST PLACES ON EARTH 
THIS IS THE BIGGEST FLOWER IN THE WORLD 
THIS SNOW IS NOT WHITE 
THIS IS THE BIGGEST CREATURE THAT EXISTS ON THE PLANET THE BLUE WHALE AND IT'S COMING UP 
IT'S COMING UP THERE 
DAVID'S FASCINATION FOR THE NATURAL WORLD WAS KINDLED AT A YOUNG AGE 
THE FAMILY USED TO GO ON HOLIDAY IN NORTH WALES ON ANGLESEY 
DAVE WOULD DISAPPEAR YOU COULDN'T FIND DAVE ANYWHERE 
HE WAS ON THE BEACH AND WOULD COLLECT NOT ONLY ANYTHING THAT MOVED BUT FOSSILS 
HE ABSOLUTELY ADORED FOSSILS 
SO IT WAS NO SURPRISE HE WOULD ONE DAY APPEAR ON OUR T. V. SCREENS 
GRAPPLING WITH ANIMALS IN FAR OFF PLACES FOR HIS FIRST SERIES ZOO QUEST 
THE SERIES INVOLVED CATCHING WILD ANIMALS FOR ZOOS 
WHICH ISN'T SOMETHING YOU'D FIND ATTENBOROUGH DOING TODAY 
BUT IT'S A CLEAR REMINDER OF HOW ATTITUDES HAVE CHANGED 
FIFTY YEARS SINCE HIS FIRST T. V. APPEARANCE 
IT'D BE HARD TO FIND ANYONE WHO DOESN'T RECOGNISE DAVID ATTENBOROUGH 
OR EVEN AN IMITATION OF HIM 
TONIGHT ON LIFE ON EARTH WE LOOK AT A CREATURE WHOSE SURVIVAL IN THE MODERN WORLD 
CONTINUES TO BAFFLE SCIENTISTS AND LAYMEN ALIKE 
SO WHAT IS IT ABOUT HIM THAT'S MADE HIM SO POPULAR TO THIS DAY 
IS IT HIS CHARISMA HIS CREDIBILITY 
HIS NEVER ENDING ENTHUSIASM 
OR HIS RESPECTFUL NON INTRUSIVE APPROACH WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THOSE CHARACTERISTIC HUSHED TONES 
THERE IS MORE MEANING 
AND MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING 
IN EXCHANGING A GLANCE WITH A GORILLA 
THAN ANY OTHER ANIMAL I KNOW 
IN CONTRAST TO MANY EARLY PRESENTERS 
DAVID HAS ALWAYS SHONE THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE ANIMALS NOT HIMSELF 
WHICH IS WHY IF YOU'VE EVER WONDERED WE ALWAYS SEE HIM WEARING THE SAME CLOTHES 
PEOPLE SAY WHY DO YOU ALWAYS WEAR THE SAME THING 
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU CHANGE YOUR COSTUME AND WEAR I DON'T KNOW 
SOME KIND OF I DON'T KNOW SOME KIND OF FASHIONABLE THING PEOPLE SAY WHY HAS HE DONE THAT 
IS IT TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING HAS THE CLIMATE CHANGED 
YOU KNOW WHAT'S HE TRYING TO DO 
SO YOU ARE ASKING FOR ATTENTION AWAY FROM WHAT IT IS YOU'RE TRYING TO TALK ABOUT 
AND HIS SOLE OBJECT IN LIFE AT THE MOMENT IS TO MAKE QUITE SURE 
THAT HE AND HE ALONE MATES WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM AND TO THAT HE MUST FIGHT 
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER 
SIR DAVID HAS HAD MORE THAN A LIFETIME'S WORTH OF INTERESTING ENCOUNTERS 
WHEN I CAUGHT UP WITH THEM AT THE TOP OF THE PASS I FOUND TO MY HORROR 
THAT THE MEN WERE REFUSING TO GO ANY FURTHER 
THEY TOLD ME VERY FIRMLY THAT THIS WAS THE END OF THEIR TRIBAL FRONTIER 
I SAID NOW COME ON LADS 
AND THEY SAID NO GOOD NO GOOD I SAID WHY NOT 
THEY SAID WE NO GO ALONG HIM WHY NOT 
THAT MEANS THEY'RE CANNIBALS DOWN THERE I SAID NOW LADS 
IF IT'S ANOTHER SIXPENCE A DAY YOU WANT YOU KNOW WE CAN HAVE A PROPER ORGANISED TALK ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW 
AND THEY SAID NO NO HIM NO GOOD HIM BAD FELLOW 
AND WHILE I WAS ACTUALLY SAYING THIS WITH ME BEING VERY BRITISH ABOUT THE WHOLE THING 
I SUDDENLY LOOKED DOWN THE SLOPE AND I SAW BEHIND A TREE 
A WHITE COCKATOO FEATHER FLASH AND I TURNED ROUND AGAIN AND THERE BEHIND A BOULDER WAS THE GLINT OF A KNIFE 
I THOUGHT OH 
AND WHILE I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF THINKING OH 
SUDDENLY OUT ONTO THE TRACK ABOUT SEVENTY OR EIGHTY MEN SUDDENLY JUMPED OUT OF HIDING 
AND RAN DOWN TOWARDS US BRANDISHING SPEARS AND WAVING KNIVES 
AND TO SAY I WAS ALARMED IS TO PUT IT MILDLY 
CHARLES LAGUS WHO WAS MY COMPANION AT THE TIME WITH THE CAMERA 
HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND 
HE'D GOT IT IN HIS HAND SIMPLY TO TURN IT SO I KNOW ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED 
WHAT HAPPENED WAS I WALKED TOWARDS THIS SCREAMING HORDE OF MEN 
AND I ACTUALLY HEARD MYSELF I STUCK OUT MY HAND AND I HEARD MYSELF SAY GOOD AFTERNOON 
IT'S TRUE 
TO MY ENORMOUS RELIEF THEY GREETED ME NOT FIERCELY BUT WITH CONSIDERABLE ENTHUSIASM 
LAUGHING AT MYSELF I DISCOVERED THAT THIS IN FACT IS MERELY THE NORMAL NEW GUINEA WELCOME 
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES A NEW NAME BECAME LINKED TO WILDLIFE PROGRAMMES 
BUT THIS TIME THEY WERE SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN 
THE NEW SERIES WAS ANIMAL MAGIC 
AND THE NEW NAME JOHNNY MORRIS 
HELLO 
ISN'T IT ROTTEN WHEN YOU CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING TO DO 
YES NOW LET ME HAVE THE HOSE WENDY WENDY 
CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF JOHNNY MORRIS WAS NOT A PROFESSIONAL ZOO KEEPER HE WAS AN ENTERTAINER 
HIS PLAYFUL HUMOUR AND ANTHROPOMORPHISM IS REMINISCENT OF THE EARLY DAYS OF KEARTON 
BUT JOHNNY MORRIS TOOK IT ONE STEP FURTHER HE PUT WORDS INTO THE ANIMALS' MOUTHS DEAR ME 
ARE YOU FEELING QUITE QUIET TODAY 
I AM FEELING QUIET THANK YOU 
WE ARE JUST SIMPLE ANIMALS WHAT IS LIVING A SIMPLE LIFE 
AND LIKING VERY MUCH ALL THE LEAVES THAT KIND PEOPLE ARE BRINGING TO US FROM TIME TO TIME 
YES AND I WOULD LIKE TO SECOND THAT GOOD 
I MEAN LOOK AT THE CLOUDS 
I KNOW I JUST WANTED TO TAKE HIM OUT TODAY 
OH DEAR PERHAPS THE SUN WILL SHINE TOMORROW 
PERHAPS I CAN SIT ON YOUR LAP 
OH YES 
ARE YOU QUITE COMFORTABLE 
YOU ARE 
THAT'S GOOD YEAH 
OH MY GOODNESS ME 
IS THAT ALL RIGHT FOR YOU 
HOW'S THE LITTLE ONE 
DON'T YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO SUPPORT HIS HEAD LIKE THIS 
LOOK IF YOU'RE SO BLINKING CLEVER YOU NURSE HIM 
GO ON THERE GET ON WITH IT 
SOME PEOPLE THINK THEY KNOW THE LOT 
AND SOME PEOPLE BRIDLED AT THE LEVEL OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM 
BUT JOHNNY MORRIS'S FUN FILLED SERIES RAN FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS 
WOULD YOU ALLOW ME TO PULL A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR COAT OFF NO THEY 
HERE IT IS IT COMES OFF OH 
IT COMES OFF 
THE SERIES THAT REPLACED IT TURNED OUT TO BE EQUALLY POPULAR AND RAN FOR THE SAME LENGTH OF TIME 
WE'D BETTER CUT THERE AND START AGAIN 
IT WAS CALLED THE REALLY WILD SHOW 
SH RIGHT HELLO AND WELCOME TO THIS 
THE REALLY WILD SHOW 
THAT'S RIGHT THE REALLY WILD SHOW 
AND A BIG WELCOME FROM NICK CHRIS AND MYSELF TO THIS 
THE VERY FIRST IN A BRAND NEW SERIES 
OF NATURAL HISTORY PROGRAMMES FROM BRISTOL 
BY NOW A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF WILDLIFE PRESENTERS WERE RUNNING 
JUMPING AND LEAPING ONTO OUR SCREENS 
I NEED ONE OF THESE 
AND A PEREGRINE FALCON 
GO GO 
I CAN SEE THE HEADLINES NOW WILDLIFE PRESENTER KILLED BY ASSASSIN BUG 
THIS IS THE BEST WAY IN THE WORLD TO SEE ELEPHANTS 
THEY PASS RIGHT UNDERNEATH YOU BUT THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA THAT YOU'RE HERE 
AND THIS ONE GETS HIMSELF INTO A. 
HEY 
BEING KICKED BY A GORILLA I THINK IS A PRIVILEGE 
THE BIGGEST SCOTTISH RIVER IS THIS ONE THE TAY 
YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THEY'RE ALSO LEARNING TO TRUMPET WHICH THEY SEEM TO QUITE ENJOY DOING 
OH 
WHAT HAVE WE FOUND A COUPLE OF PAIRS MATING OVER HERE 
TWO OF THEM THREE OF THEM 
GO GO GO GO GO 
GOOD HUNTING LESSON NUMBER ONE PRETTY SUCCESSFUL 
WOW 
BELIEVE ME I'VE HAD ANTS IN MY PANTS AND IT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO HAVING A FIDDLER CRAB IN YOUR SHORTS 
IN JUST A MATTER OF MINUTES I'VE ATTRACTED LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF BEETLES 
AND ALL WITH THE TINIEST DROP OF PHEROMONE 
THESE ARE THE MOMENTS I LIVE FOR 
WHERE TIME STANDS STILL 
SO JOIN ME ON AN ADVENTURE INTO A MYSTERIOUS WORLD 
I FEEL VERY MUCH LIKE AN ASTRONAUT 
THAT HAS JUST TOUCHED DOWN ON THE PLANET OF PENGUINS A PLACE INHABITED BY MONOCHROMATIC DWARFS 
GO GO GO 
WITHOUT MY CLOTHES I A. M. GOING TO DIE 
ALL RIGHT MATE 
YES WELL WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN STYLES AND INDEED OUR OWN THRESHOLDS OF MODESTY 
BUT I DO THINK A PRESENTER CAN ADD SOMETHING TO A WILDLIFE PROGRAMME 
BY BRINGING IN A CERTAIN STYLE OR ATTITUDE OR BEING A SORT OF A GUIDE 
BUT THEN I WOULD SAY THAT WOULDN'T I 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THOUGH THERE ARE MANY WILDLIFE FILMS 
THAT HAVE NO HUMAN INVOLVEMENT WHATSOEVER 
BUT THEY SIMPLY ASTONISH US BY THEIR TRULY PIONEERING NATURE 
AND IN THIS CASE THE PIONEERS THEMSELVES ARE THE FILM MAKERS 
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED TO TAKE A FEW RISKS 
IN A SERIES KINGDOM OF THE ICE BEAR PRODUCER MIKE SALISBURY BRAVED SUB ZERO TEMPERATURES 
AND DANGEROUS PREDATORS TO FILM POLAR BEARS EMERGING FROM THEIR WINTER HIBERNATION 
WE WERE ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT 
WHEN A MOTHER BEAR BRINGS OUT HER CUBS FOR THE FIRST TIME 
WE HAD TWO SLEDS ON THE BACK OF EACH SNOWMOBILE LOADED WITH CAMPING GEAR 
FOOD FUEL EVERYTHING WE NEEDED FOR SIX WEEKS 
WE FOUND ONE DEN AFTER ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AND IT SEEMED TO BE PERFECT 
WE BUILT A SORT OF HALF AN IGLOO AS A HIDE 
SET IT UP AND THEN SHE CAME OUT 
WANDERED DOWN THE SIDE OF THE HILL AND OFF DOWN THE VALLEY AND THAT'S THE LAST WE SAW OF HER 
WE THOUGHT OH NO THERE WAS NO SIGN OF CUBS HAVING BEEN THERE AT ALL 
WE'D CHOSEN PERHAPS THE ONE DEN IN THE WHOLE OF SPITSBERGEN 
WHERE A MOTHER BEAR HAD HAD A FALSE PREGNANCY 
RIGHT I MEAN I THINK IN THE LAST WEEK OF THE RATIONS AND FUEL AND EVERYTHING WE HAD 
UM WE FOUND A DEN ON A SLOPE ABOVE THE SEA ICE 
WE MADE ANOTHER SORT OF IGLOO HIDE 
IN THE END THE MOTHER CAME OUT AND WE WERE REALLY LUCKY 
BECAUSE SHE DID THIS WONDERFUL SORT OF SLIDING DOWN ON HER BACK 
OUT OF THE DEN WITH HER LEGS IN THE AIR 
YOU REALLY FELT THAT SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO BE OUT AFTER ALL THOSE WEEKS IN THE DEN 
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY SHE WENT BACK AND GOT THE CUBS OUT AND WE GOT OUR SEQUENCE PHEW 
WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF OPENING THE DEN A MOTHER BEAR WILL TAKE THE CUBS ON SHORT OUTINGS 
STRENGTHENING THEIR LEGS FOR LONGER JOURNEYS ACROSS THE SEA ICE 
A THIRD CUB HAS SURFACED BUT IS TOO NERVOUS TO JOIN THE OTHERS ALTHOUGH ON THIS FIRST OUTING 
THE ATTENTIVE MOTHER WILL NOT TAKE THEM FAR FROM THE SAFETY OF THE DEN 
AT MZIMA SPRINGS IN KENYA IN THE LATE SIXTIES NEWCOMERS TO WILDLIFE FILMS JOAN AND ALAN ROOT 
WANTED TO MAKE THEIR MARK ON THE INDUSTRY 
SO THEY DECIDED THEY'D START WITH THE ANIMAL THAT KILLS MORE PEOPLE IN AFRICA THAN ANY OTHER HIPPOS 
HIPPOS HAD BEEN FILMED ON LAND BUT THE ROOTS WANTED TO BE 
THE FIRST PEOPLE EVER TO GET SHOTS OF HIPPOS UNDERWATER 
CRAZY IDEA POSSIBLY 
HOW WERE THEY GOING TO DO IT 
HERE AT ITS MOORINGS IS SCHEME ONE MARK ONE 
THE IDEA WAS THAT JOAN SHOULD LIE IN THE APPROPRIATELY COFFIN SHAPED HULL 
AND DO THE FILMING WHILE ALAN PUNTED HER TO SUITABLE LOCATIONS 
SHE WAS TO FILM THROUGH THE GLASS FRONT OF THIS PARTICULAR CRAFT AND USE THE THING AS A MOBILE HIDE 
WELL THAT WAS THE IDEA 
SO THEY SET SAIL IN SCHEME ONE MARK ONE 
AND HEADED BOTH FOR DEEPER WATER AND FOR HIPPOS OR CROCODILES OR WHATEVER 
TROUBLE THE HIPPOS SHEERED OFF AND THE GLASS STEAMED UP 
SO SQUEEGEEING WAS NECESSARY 
BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH POINT EVEN IN CLEAN GLASS IF THERE WAS NOTHING TO SEE 
AND SO THEY MOVED ON TO SCHEME TWO TO SEE IF THAT WOULD WORK 
IF ANYTHING THIS IS AN EVEN BIGGER FAILURE THAN THE FLOATING TANK 
ALTHOUGH IT'S CERTAINLY A LOT COOLER 
THE WAY IT WORKS IS I PUT MY FEET THROUGH HOLES IN THE BOTTOM 
THEN LIFT THE CAGE UP ON MY SHOULDERS 
AND WALK AROUND FOLLOWING THE HIPPO 
IN THEORY 
WHAT IT GAINED IN COOLNESS IT LOST IN MANOEUVRABILITY 
ALSO WHEN BIRNAM WOOD CAME TO MZIMA THE WIND WOULD CATCH HOLD OF IT 
AND WOULD CARE NOT A FIG FOR THE MAN BELOW 
FOR THE MAN WHO WAS IN THEORY AT THE HELM OF MARK ONE SCHEME TWO 
SO THEY LEFT SCHEME TWO AND MAINLY TOOK TO SNORKELLING INSTEAD ALTHOUGH THE CAGES DID HAVE THEIR USES 
SKIN DIVING WAS INFINITELY MORE PRACTICAL 
BUT WITH LIMBS TOTALLY EXPOSED IT MEANT KEEPING A VERY GOOD LOOKOUT 
AT ALL TIMES ON A NORMAL UNDERWATER CAMERA AND THEN SWIMMING AS CLOSE TO THE QUARRY AS ONE DARED TO GO 
THE ROOTS' INGENUITY AND PERSEVERANCE HAD PAID OFF 
AND THEY'D ACHIEVED EXACTLY WHAT THEY SET OUT TO DO 
THEIR FILM MZIMA MADE HISTORY BY SHOWING HIPPOS UNDERWATER FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME 
IT WAS A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT BUT NOT WITHOUT MISHAP 
NOT ONLY DID ALAN GET BITTEN THROUGH THE LEG WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF TWO MALE HIPPOS FIGHTING 
BUT JOAN ALSO HAD AN INCREDIBLY NARROW ESCAPE 
A TOOTH PASSED MILLIMETRES FROM HER FACE TEARING THE MASK 
AND BREAKING THE GLASS BUT INCREDIBLY LEAVING JOAN UNMARKED 
UNDETERRED BY THEIR ENCOUNTERS THE ROOTS CONTINUED TO WORK WITH DANGEROUS ANIMALS 
ALAN ACHIEVED THESE REMARKABLE SHOTS OF THIS COBRA SPITTING 
OUT ITS LETHAL VENOM AT YOU GUESSED IT HIS WIFE JOAN 
SPECTACLES ARE ENOUGH TO PROTECT THE EYES AND IF IT'S QUICKLY WASHED OFF THE VENOM DOESN'T HARM THE SKIN 
WILD ANIMALS ARE UNPREDICTABLE AND SOMETIMES A DANGEROUS SITUATION COMES OUT OF THE BLUE 
LACKING A DART TO DELIVER THE VITAL ANTIDOTE THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO DO TO TRY TO INJECT IT BY HAND 
ELEPHANT BIOLOGIST IAIN DOUGLAS HAMILTON 
FELT DUTY BOUND TO ADMINISTER THE ANTIDOTE 
TO SAVE THE STRICKEN ANIMAL'S LIFE 
BUT THINK ABOUT IT 
THE CAMERA MAN DIETER PLAGE HIS LIFE WAS ALSO IN DANGER 
BUT HE CARRIED ON FILMING 
WHEN THAT FAILED TO DRIVE IN CLOSE WAS THE ONLY HOPE 
THE NEEDLE WENT HOME AND SO DID SARAH'S CROSS TUSKS 
HAVING AS SHE THOUGHT WIPED OUT HER ENEMY 
SHE BACKED OFF TO TEND THE BULL WHO WAS BEGINNING TO COME ROUND 
FILM MAKERS IN AFRICA QUITE LITERALLY TAKING RISKS WITH GENUINELY DANGEROUS CREATURES 
MEANWHILE IN BRITAIN FILM MAKERS WERE TAKING MORE TECHNICAL RISKS 
WITH CREATURES WHICH WERE A LITTLE LESS DANGEROUS 
LIKE BIRDS 
PRODUCER JOHN DOWNER TRIED A NUMBER OF WAYS TO GIVE VIEWERS 
THE SENSE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FLY LIKE A BIRD 
I WANTED TO MAKE A FILM ABOUT BIRD FLIGHT 
BUT THE ONLY WAY I COULD SEE DOING IT IS YOU HAD TO BE UP THERE WITH THEM 
AND SO IT WAS REALLY 
LETTING YOUR IMAGINATION RUN WILD AND THINK 
HOW CAN WE USE TECHNIQUES TO GET UP THERE 
TECHNIQUES THAT HADN'T BEEN USED BEFORE 
AND SO WE PUT A LITTLE CAMERA INSIDE THE NOSE OF A MODEL GLIDER 
WE REDESIGNED THE ACTUAL METHOD OF PROPULSION 
SO THE PROPELLERS FROM BEHIND WERE PUSHING OUT SO THE CAMERA COULD SEE FORWARD 
AND SO WE DESIGNED THIS NEW CRAFT AND TOOK IT OFF 
ON TO INTERCEPT BIRDS ON MIGRATIONS WHITE STORKS ON MIGRATION 
BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN IT CLIPPED THESE TREES SMASHED INTO A THOUSAND PIECES 
THE CAMERA WAS A TOTAL WRITE OFF FILM SPEWED EVERYWHERE 
SO MODEL GLIDER IN PIECES JOHN TRIED HIS LUCK WITH MODEL HELICOPTERS 
WE USED TO GET THROUGH A MODEL HELICOPTER FOR EVERY SHOT 
BECAUSE THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME GREMLIN IN THE WORKS AS SO OFTEN HAPPENS 
EVERYTHING'S FINE WHEN YOU TEST IT BUT AS SOON AS YOU COME TO FILM THE THING PLUMMETS OUT OF THE SKY 
SO ABANDON GLIDER ABANDON HELICOPTER 
AND JOHN TURNED TO THE ALREADY TRIED AND TESTED METHOD OF IMPRINTING 
WHEREBY NEWLY HATCHED DUCKLINGS ADOPT THE FIRST THING THEY SEE AS THEIR PARENT 
IF YOU BECOME THAT PARENT IT WILL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO 
AND IF YOU GO UP IN THE AIR ULTIMATELY WHEN IT CAN FLY IT WILL GO UP THERE WITH YOU 
SO HOW DO YOU FLY ALONGSIDE A BIRD 
WELL IF YOU'RE JOHN DOWNER YOU SIMPLY FIX A PARASCENDER ONTO YOUR BACK 
THEN GET SOMEONE TO TOW YOU ALONG IN A LAND ROVER UNTIL YOU TAKE OFF LIKE A BIRD 
AND THEN CRASH LIKE A T. V. PRODUCER 
TAKE TWO 
I GOT UP IN THE AIR AND THOUGHT NOW'S THE TIME TO RELEASE SO I GOT THE DUCK OUT 
WHICH WAS CALLED GADAFFI AND CAST IT OFF 
AND THEN IT STARTED TO PLUMMET AND I THOUGHT OH NO 
IS IT GOING TO FLY 
AND IT DROPPED AND THEN SUDDENLY FOUND ITS WINGS RACED UP 
UNTIL IT WAS LITERALLY THERE AND I WAS FLYING ALONGSIDE IT 
IT WAS ABOUT A FOOT AWAY FROM ME 
IT WAS THE MOST MAGICAL EXPERIENCE 
AND A MAGICAL EXPERIENCE RESULTED IN MAGICAL IMAGES 
JOHN DOWNER WASN'T THE FIRST TO USE IMPRINTED BIRDS BUT HE CERTAINLY TOOK FILMING OF THEM TO NEW HEIGHTS 
BACK DOWN ON THE GROUND 
JOHN DOWNER AND OTHERS HAVE DEPLOYED EVER WACKIER WAYS 
TO GET CLOSE TO THEIR SUBJECTS THOUGH SOME OF THE CAST CLEARLY PREFER TO FILM THEMSELVES 
CAN YOU GUESS WHAT IT IS YET 
INGENIOUS INTREPID OR MAYBE JUST A BIT SILLY 
BUT THEN AGAIN THAT'S ONE OF THE JOYS OF WILDLIFE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO APPROACH IT 
IT CAN BE FUN OR IT CAN BE A VERY SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC STUDY 
IN FACT SOME OF THE BEST WILDLIFE FILMS HAVE BEEN MADE BY FILM MAKERS WHO HAVE TAPPED IN TO THE FONT 
OF KNOWLEDGE ACCUMULATED BY SCIENTISTS 
WHO HAVE SPENT MAYBE THEIR WHOLE LIVES STUDYING A SINGLE SPECIES 
TO FILM INTIMATE DETAILS OF ELEPHANT FAMILY LIFE IN KENYA FILM MAKER MARTIN COLBECK 
HAD TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ELEPHANT BIOLOGIST CYNTHIA MOSS WHO'D STUDIED ONE GROUP FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
WELL THE FIRST THING WE TRIED TO DO WAS TO GET TO KNOW ALL THE ELEPHANTS INDIVIDUALLY 
AT THAT TIME THERE WERE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED ELEPHANTS IN THE POPULATION 
THAT WAS A VERY NICE NUMBER TO BEGIN WITH BECAUSE WE FELT THAT THAT WAS 
WITHIN THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY TO KNOW EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS 
HOW MANY HUNDRED BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX HUNDRED 
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO DO THAT 
IT TOOK QUITE A LONG TIME IT TOOK OF A COUPLE OF YEARS AT LEAST 
I THINK IN FACT THAT IT WASN'T UNTIL NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I FELT I KNEW EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN THE POPULATION 
HOW DO YOU RECOGNISE THEM BY THEIR EARS FIRST OF ALL 
THAT'S THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC 
THEIR EARS ARE NEVER ABSOLUTELY SMOOTH ALONG THE EDGE 
THERE'S USUALLY LITTLE NICKS OR HOLES OR WHATEVER 
AND ALSO THE VEIN PATTERN IS VERY DISTINCTIVE 
BUT AFTER A WHILE YOU GET SO USED TO THEM AND YOU RECOGNISE THE WHOLE ELEPHANT 
CYNTHIA'S IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE HELPED TO RECORD 
SOME OF THE MOST ENCHANTING MOMENTS EVER CAPTURED ON FILM 
ELI WAS BORN IN NINETEEN NINETY CRIPPLED 
AT THE TIME HIS CHANCES OF SURVIVAL SEEMED SLIM 
BUT NEITHER HIS MOTHER ECHO NOR HIS SISTER ENID WOULD DESERT HIM 
WITH AMAZING DETERMINATION HE TRIED OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO STRETCH HIS BENT LEGS 
UNTIL FINALLY ON THE THIRD DAY HE MANAGED TO STAND UP 
BY THE TIME ELI WAS A WEEK OLD HE WAS ABLE TO KEEP UP 
WITH THE FAMILY EVEN THOUGH HIS LEGS WERE A BIT RUBBERY 
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES ACCLAIMED FILM MAKER HUGO VAN LAWICK 
TEAMED UP WITH A YOUNG RESEARCHER JANE GOODALL 
WHO WAS AT THE START OF WHAT WOULD BECOME A LIFETIME STUDY OF TANZANIA'S WILD CHIMPANZEES 
IN DOCUMENTING JANE'S RESEARCH HUGO'S FILM KNOCKED US OFF OUR PEDESTAL 
AND MADE US RETHINK OUR DEFINITION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN 
SHE MOVES IN A LITTLE CLOSER AND MAKES A STARTLING DISCOVERY 
SHE SEES A CHIMP PICKING A LEAF CRUMPLING IT IN HIS MOUTH 
AND USING IT TO SUP UP WATER 
COLLECTED DEEP IN THE HOLLOW OF A TREE 
UNTIL THIS STUDY MAN ALONE HAS BEEN CONSIDERED THE TOOL MAKER 
CHIMPANZEES HAVE BEEN SEEN DRINKING FROM NATURAL WATER BOWLS IN UGANDA 
BUT ON THOSE INSTANCES THEY MERELY DIPPED THEIR FINGER INTO THE WATER AND LICKED OFF THE DROPS 
THE EXCITING FACT IN THE GOMBE STREAM AREA 
IS THAT THE CHIMPANZEE BY INITIALLY CRUMPLING BELIEVES INTO A SPONGE IS IN FACT MAKING A TOOL 
IN THIS FILM OUR CLOSEST LIVING RELATIVES WERE SHOWN AS INTELLIGENT SOPHISTICATED ANIMALS 
BUT IN THE TAI FOREST IN WEST AFRICA THE SWISS BIOLOGIST HAD DISCOVERED 
A RATHER LESS PEACEFUL SIDE TO THEIR NATURE 
AND THE B. B. C. WERE KEEN TO TAP INTO HIS TEN YEAR STUDY 
PRACTICALLY PART OF THE GROUP AND ABLE TO RECOGNISE ALL THE CHIMPS INDIVIDUALLY STRAIGHT AWAY 
IS A SWISS ZOOLOGIST CHRISTOPHE BOESCH 
FOR TEN YEARS WORKING ALMOST EVERY DAY FROM DAWN TILL DUSK 
HE HAS STUDIED AND RECORDED THE GROUP'S BEHAVIOUR WITH HIS WIFE HEDWIGE 
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO GET THESE ANIMALS SO ACCUSTOMED TO YOU 
SO THAT WE COULD STAND THIS CLOSE TO THEM AS THIS 
OH JUST PATIENCE 
IT TOOK US FIVE YEARS 
FIVE YEARS FIVE YEARS JUST FOLLOWING THEM 
AND BEING ALWAYS VERY QUIET NEVER AGGRESSIVE ALWAYS THE SAME COLOURS AND CLOTHES 
AND PATIENCE PATIENCE 
AT THE BEGINNING IT WAS ABSOLUTELY THE IMPOSSIBLE 
IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING JUST BOTTOMS RUNNING AWAY 
MOVING QUICKLY AND QUIETLY THE MALES ARE LOOKING FOR COLOBUS 
THE HUNT IS ON THE MALES START TO CLIMB 
EACH HUNTER HAS HIS OWN SPECIAL ROLE TO PLAY 
THIS MALE IS THE DRIVER 
HE KEEPS THE COLOBUS MOVING IN ONE DIRECTION 
ANOTHER CLIMBS QUIETLY INTO POSITION READY TO BLOCK AN ESCAPE 
THIS IS THE AMBUSHER WAITING QUIETLY AHEAD 
WHEN THE TIME COMES HE WILL RUSH UP AND CLOSE THE TRAP 
THE DRIVER LEAPS 
NOW COLOBUS AND CHIMP ARE IN THE SAME TREE 
THE AMBUSHER RUSHES UP TO CLOSE THE TRAP 
A HUNTER NEARLY GRABS ITS PREY 
A CAPTURE FEMALES SCREAM WITH EXCITEMENT 
THE HUNTERS STRUGGLE TO BRING THEIR VICTIM TO THE GROUND 
ONLY AFTER THE KILL HAS BEEN DISMEMBERED DOES THE FOREST FINALLY QUIETEN DOWN 
WE MADE A FILM ABOUT CHIMPS HUNTING MONKEYS 
THAT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY AND POWERFUL AND ALARMING AND DISMAYING THING TO SEE 
AGAIN PEOPLE SAY HOW CAN YOU PUT ON SUCH SAVAGERY OF A PREDATOR CATCHING PREY 
AND YOU ARE MILKING IT FOR VIOLENCE 
IF THEY SAW WHAT YOU PUT OUT ON THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR 
OF THIS ANIMAL IN SUFFERING 
IT IS A VERY NARROW LINE YOU HAVE TO TREAD 
YOU CANNOT IN MY VIEW ELIMINATE IT ENTIRELY 
THAT IS TO SENTIMENTALISE AND DISTORT REALITY 
BUT EQUALLY SOME OF IT IS VERY HARD TO TAKE 
THIS LINE BETWEEN REALITY AND SENSITIVITY 
VARIES DEPENDING ON WHICH SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC YOU LIVE ON AND INDEED 
WHICH END OF THE CENTURY YOU'RE BORN INTO 
AS EARLY AS NINETEEN TEN 
CAMERAMAN CARL AKELEY STAGED THIS LION SPEARING RITUAL IN KENYA 
ALTHOUGH WE ONLY SEE ONE LION ACTUALLY BEING SPEARED IN FACT 
HE ALLOWED FOURTEEN LIONS ARE TO BE KILLED JUST TO GET THE SEQUENCE HE WANTED 
HE DID THOUGH SPARE THE AUDIENCE ANY BLOODSHED 
THE JOHNSONS' FILM SIMBA EARNED THEM TWO MILLION DOLLARS 
ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING FOR NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT 
THE SUCCESS OF THESE CARNAGE FILLED FILMS LED TO THE FEELING IN AMERICA 
THAT FILMS WITHOUT THRILLS AND KILLS SIMPLY WOULD NOT SUCCEED 
ALREADY THE BIG ANIMAL HAS SEEN HER 
THE BULLET HAS FOUND ITS MARK 
ONCE KING OF THE JUNGLE 
AND NOW MERELY FOUR HUNDRED L. B. S. OF DEAD BEAST AND ALSO 
CLEARLY AMERICAN TASTES HAVEN'T CHANGED ALL THAT MUCH 
WITNESS THIS NINETEEN NINETY TRAIL FOR THE B. B. C.'S TRIALS OF LIFE 
'. THAT EXPOSES THE STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE THROUGH UNCENSORED SHOCKING PHOTOGRAPHY 
TURNER BROADCASTING AND TIME LIFE VIDEO 
DARE YOU TO TAKE A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE WITH TRIALS OF LIFE 
THERE ARE A TEAM B. TEAM AND C. TEAM ANIMALS 
INSECTS ARE SORT OF C. TEAM DEFINITELY AND LIONS ARE A TEAM 
ANYTHING THAT'S BIG AND SCARY AND A PREDATOR IS DEFINITELY WHAT MOST PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE 
JOIN ACCLAIMED NATURALIST DAVID ATTENBOROUGH 
FOR OUR CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH RAW NATURE AS YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE 
IT TOOK OUT OF CONTEXT A NUMBER OF SHOTS OF PREDATION AND FIGHTING 
AND CUT THEM TOGETHER SO FAST WITH EXTRAORDINARY EXAGGERATED MUSIC 
TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE SERIES WAS ALL ABOUT VIOLENCE 
WHICH IT WASN'T 
TRIALS OF LIFE IS A FIRST HAND ACCOUNT OF THE STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE IN A SAVAGE UNTAMED ENVIRONMENT 
THE WAY IT WAS MARKETED I THINK WAS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD DISAGREE 
BUT I THINK IT WAS BRILLIANT THEY DID IT TOOTH AND CLAW 
VIOLENT FOOTAGE SHOWS YOU THE LIFE AND DEATH STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE IN A HARSH AND BRUTAL WORLD 
AMERICAN NETWORKS LOVE THEIR THRILLS AND KILLS BUT NO BLOOD 
SO WHILST FILMS DISTORT THE TRUTH BY OVER REPRESENTING KILLS 
THEY ALSO DISTORT THE TRUTH BY SANITISING THE KILL ITSELF 
AS THE B. B. C. SERIES BIG CAT WEEK UNCUT SHOWED 
ANIMALS ARE OFTEN DON'T DIE QUICKLY 
IT CAN TAKE HOURS 
THE SHOWING OF VIOLENCE WILL ALWAYS BE CONTROVERSIAL 
AND SO INDEED WILL THE SHOWING OF SEX 
IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES AN AMATEUR FILM MAKER AND ERIC ASHBY MADE HISTORY WITH HIS FILM A HARE'S LIFE 
HE DID A DARING THING AND SHOWED HARES MATING 
A FIRST FOR WILDLIFE PROGRAMMES 
IT WAS A DISCREET LONG SHOT BUT APPARENTLY SHOCKING ENOUGH TO RESULT 
IN A FLOOD OF ANGRY LETTERS FROM AN IRATE BRITISH PUBLIC 
IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR BRITAIN TO GET USED TO THE IDEA OF MATING ANIMALS 
BUT IT TOOK VERY MUCH LONGER IN AMERICA 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR THIS SCENE FROM SURVIVAL'S THE FAMILY THAT LIVES WITH ELEPHANTS 
WAS DELETED BEFORE BEING TRANSMITTED ON AMERICAN NETWORKS 
SOON INEVITABLY THE YOUNG MALES BECOME INTERESTED IN THE FEMALE CALVES 
THEY'RE BEGINNING TO BECOME A THOROUGH NUISANCE IN THE FAMILY 
SUCH SCENES WOULD ONLY BECOME ACCEPTABLE ON AMERICAN T. V. IN THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
THIRTY YEARS AFTER BRITAIN HAD FIRST SHOCKED ITS AUDIENCE 
SEX AND GENITALIA THE VERY CURRENCY OF POWER BETWEEN THE SEXES 
ARE CONTINUALLY ON SHOW AND BECOME SOCIAL ASSETS RATHER THAN DEMONSTRATIONS OF DOMINANCE 
SO THE CONTENT OF WILDLIFE FILMS OVER THE LAST CENTURY 
HAS HAD AS MUCH TO DO WITH THE WIDER SOCIAL ATTITUDES 
AS IT HAS HAD TO DO WITH THE ADVANCES IN SCIENCE 
NOWADAYS WE RESPECT AND WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE INTRICATE DETAILS OF NATURAL BEHAVIOUR 
A PRETTY FAR CRY FROM THOSE EARLY DAYS 
WHEN UNFAMILIAR ANIMALS WERE ALMOST CONSIDERED FREAKS 
A HERD OF LOPING UNGAINLY GIRAFFES STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH THEIR BROTHERS OF THE JUNGLE 
THE GIRAFFES TAKE ON A GROTESQUE UNREAL APPEARANCE 
ALMOST LIKE TINY ANIMATED TOYS PUMPING THEIR WAY ACROSS A SHOP WINDOW OR NURSERY FLOOR 
OUR ATTITUDES HAVE DEFINITELY IMPROVED BUT ALAS THE SITUATION FOR THE WILDLIFE DEFINITELY HASN'T 
WHEN CHERRY KEARTON TOOK THESE SHOTS THERE WERE AN ESTIMATED TEN MILLION ELEPHANTS IN AFRICA 
TODAY THERE ARE JUST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
THE VAST HERDS OF PLAINS ANIMALS SEEN ROAMING ACROSS AFRICA IN THOSE DAYS 
ARE TODAY REPLACED BY SMALL POPULATIONS CONFINED WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF NATIONAL PARKS 
AS OUR SPECIES HAS INCREASED OTHERS HAVE DECREASED 
IN THIS RELATIVELY SHORT TIME SOME WILDLIFE FILMS 
HAVE SADLY BECOME VITAL RECORDS OF SPECIES THAT NO LONGER EXIST 
JUST A FEW OF THE VERY VERY MANY SPECIES THAT ARE SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED 
AND IT REALLY DOES MAKE YOU WONDER WHAT IF MORE WILDLIFE PROGRAMMES AND FILMS IN THE PAST 
HAD BEEN ABOUT CONSERVATION WOULD THAT HAVE HELPED 
LET'S FACE IT THOSE EARLY FILMS WERE ABOUT AS CONSERVATION MINDED IS AS A TRIP TO THE CIRCUS 
BUT THE HONEST FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT WASN'T UNTIL THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
BEFORE PEOPLE BEGAN TO SERIOUSLY SUGGEST THE BIGGEST DANGER TO WILDLIFE WAS 
YEAH YOU GOT IT MAN 
IN HIS FILM NO ROOM FOR WILD ANIMALS BERNARD GRZIMEK 
MADE A BRAVE MOVE AWAY FROM ENTERTAINMENT 
TO HIGHLIGHT THE DANGERS OF OVER HUNTING IN AFRICA 
IT MADE THE POWERFUL IMPACT AND AS A RESULT 
SERENGETI NATIONAL PARK WAS ESTABLISHED IN TANZANIA AS A SAFE HAVEN FOR WILDLIFE 
WHICH IT REMAINS TODAY 
SINCE GRZIMEK OTHERS HAVE BROUGHT OUR ATTENTION TO THE PLIGHT OF INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS 
WE ARE NOW FULLY AWARE THAT THE ORANG UTAN IS RAPIDLY LOSING ITS HABITAT TO THE PALM OIL INDUSTRY 
FIVE MILLION HECTARES OF RAINFOREST HAVE BEEN DESTROYED FOR PLANTATIONS 
LEAVING THESE RED APES WITH NO WAY TO LIVE 
IF THE RELENTLESS DESTRUCTION OF BORNEO'S RAINFOREST CONTINUES 
WILD ORANG UTANS WILL BE EXTINCT WITHIN TEN YEARS 
AND WE SIMPLY CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN 
THE OCEANS LARGEST FISH THE WHALE SHARK HAS RECENTLY BECOME THE FIRST MARINE SPECIES TO BECOME PROTECTED 
UNDER THE INDIAN WILDLIFE ACT THANKS TO MIKE PANDEY'S FILM 
WHICH SHOWED HOW THESE IMPRESSIVE CREATURES WERE BEING MASSACRED ON INDIA'S SHORES 
SCORES OF WHALE SHARKS LAY ON THE BEACH 
HAULED IN TO BE SLAUGHTERED 
BUT FOR THE LOCAL PEOPLE NOTHING SEEMED AMISS 
FOR THEM IT WAS JUST ANOTHER CATCH 
A RECENT FILM ON THE PYGMY CHIMPANZEE OR BONOBO 
LOOKED AT WHAT HAPPENS TO ANIMALS IN WAR TORN AREAS LIKE THE CONGO 
IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT DEEP TENSION SURFACED AGAIN NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES LINED UP BEHIND DIFFERENT FACTIONS 
THE CONGO PLUNGED INTO A BITTER AND PROTRACTED CIVIL WAR 
NOW EVEN BONOBO RESEARCHERS CAME UNDER SUSPICION 
SOLDIERS CAME TO OUR CAMPSITE TO ARREST US 
BECAUSE THERE WAS A GENERAL BELIEF THAT WE WERE SPIES FOR THE ENEMY 
THE SCIENTISTS WERE FORCED OUT 
MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS' WORTH OF CONTINUOUS OBSERVATIONS 
A VALUABLE RECORD OF INDIVIDUAL BONOBO LIVES CAME TO AN END 
AS A RESULT OF THIS FILM MONEY HAS BEING DONATED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH 
AND TWO NEW RESEARCH SITES HAVE BEEN OPENED UP 
TO STUDY THE LAST REMAINING POPULATIONS OF WILD BONOBOES 
BUT DESPITE THESE POSITIVE OUTCOMES CONSERVATION PROGRAMMES 
CAN BE EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE TO WATCH 
THIS SHOCKING FOOTAGE LED TO THE ANTI FUR TRADE CAMPAIGN OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
THAT WE COULD GENERATE THIS SORT OF PUBLIC PRESSURE TO STOP THE FRONT HUNT 
AS WE WERE ABLE TO DO TO STOP THE MAGDALEN ISLANDS HUNT 
BUT HOWEVER IMPORTANT THAT THE MESSAGE NOT EVERYONE CAN STOMACH IMAGES LIKE THESE 
SO CAN FILMS INSPIRE CONCERN FOR THE NATURAL WORLD IN OTHER WAYS 
OF COURSE THERE ARE NATURAL HISTORY FILMS THAT 
SEND A STRAIGHT FORWARD CONSERVATION MESSAGE 
AND SO THERE SHOULD BE BUT IT WOULD BE A SAD TIME I THINK 
IF EVERY FILM FELT IMPELLED TO FOCUS ITSELF IN THAT PARTICULAR WAY 
ALL GOOD NATURAL HISTORY FILMS WHICH ARE TRUTHFUL ARE 
IN THEMSELVES CONSERVATION MESSAGES 
SO IN OTHER WORDS 
IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO CARE ABOUT THE WILD WORLD YOU HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE 
THAT IS THE FIRST THING AND IF THEY THEN READ THE FOLLOWING MORNING IN THE NEWSPAPER 
THAT THAT THING THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IS ENDANGERED THEN MAYBE THEY'LL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
BUT IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY WON'T 
FIVE MILLION BIRDS MAKE THIS JOURNEY EVERY YEAR 
THE SUCCESS OF THE B. B. C.'S RECENT SERIES PLANET EARTH 
PROVES THAT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAPTIVATED BY THE IMAGES OF BEAUTY IN THE NATURAL WORLD 
BUT IN THIS ERA OF INTERNET MOBILES MULTI CHANNEL T. V. 
FILM MAKERS HAVE GOT TO WORK HARDER THAN EVER BEFORE TO WIN THEIR AUDIENCE'S ATTENTION 
FIFTY YEARS AGO IT WAS PRETTY WELL A STRAIGHT ON LOOK AT WHAT THE ANIMAL WAS 
NOW YOU HAVE ECOLOGICAL STUDIES YOU HAVE LIFE HISTORIES 
YOU HAVE DAILY DIARIES AS YOU DO IN THINGS LIKE BIG CAT DIARY 
AND SO ON 
THEY GO UNDER THE WATER UP IN THE SKY 
THE STYLES AND SCOPE OF NATURAL HISTORY FILMING TODAY 
IS INCOMPARABLY GREATER THAN IT WAS FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
IN PARALLEL WITH SOCIETY FILMS ARE A CONTINUALLY EVOLVING MEDIUM 
JUST AS THEY REFLECTED ATTITUDES ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
PROGRAMMES TODAY MORE THAN EVER BEFORE ARE SHAPED BY THE TASTES AND THE CULTURE WE LIVE IN 
THE POPULARITY OF SOAP OPERAS HAS EVEN SPREAD INTO THE WILDLIFE FILM INDUSTRY 
THE RECENT SERIES MEERKAT MANOR HAS ENOUGH SCANDAL TO RIVAL EASTENDERS 
CARLOS AND DAISY ARE TOO WRAPPED UP IN THEMSELVES 
TO CARE WHAT ANYONE ELSE THINKS 
BUT DAISY IS GOING TO HAVE TO FACE THE MUSIC WHEN SHE GETS HOME 
HER FAMILY ARE GOING TO BE FURIOUS 
IF SHE GETS PREGNANT THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY 
AND PROGRAMMES LIKE SPRINGWATCH WHICH ARE BROADCAST LIVE 
ARE DRAWING IN BIGGER AUDIENCES THAN EVER BEFORE 
ATTRACTING VIEWERS WHO LIKE THE BUZZ OF THE UNPLANNABLE AND UNPREDICTABLE 
THIS IS FROM HELIGAN THIS IS A FOX 
THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW FOLKS THIS IS LIVE 
THIS IS AMAZING 
AND FOR ARMCHAIR EXPLORERS THERE HAS EVEN BEEN A RETURN TO THE OLD EXPEDITION STYLE OF FILM 
QUICK QUICK LOOK 
A MONITOR LIZARD 
HE WAS SITTING BASKING IN THE SUN ON THE BANK 
THE TEAM NEED TO BE QUICK IF THEY'RE TO SEE ANY CREATURES CLOSE UP 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A CRAB OR 
I THOUGHT I'LL GET THE NET 
WHAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY FOUND IS A FRESHWATER TURTLE 
IT'S A SMALL FEMALE 
AND IN THESE MORE CELEBRITY OBSESSED TIMES T. V. STARS ARE AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR INGREDIENT 
HOPEFULLY REACHING NEW AUDIENCES 
OH HOW CUTE IS THAT 
OH LOOK AT HIM 
IT'S JUST JOYFUL WE'VE MIRACULOUSLY SEEN THE FIRST PUPS SINCE THE ATTACK IN DECEMBER 
WE'VE SEEN AT LEAST THREE 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS THE DEN OR NOT 
BUT THEY'RE DEFINITELY UP HERE AND CUTE AS ANYTHING 
AND FOR CINEMA LOVERS THERE ARE NOW EVEN FILMS LIKE 
THE MARCH OF THE PENGUINS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE BIG SCREEN 
IN FACT IT'S A RETURN 
TO WHERE WILDLIFE FILMS FIRST STARTED ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
BY NOW SIMILAR CARAVANS ARE APPROACHING FROM EVERY DIRECTION 
AND FINALLY OFTEN ON THE SAME DAY 
EVEN AROUND THE SAME TIME THEY WILL ARRIVE AT THE PLACE WHERE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM WAS BORN 
I WATCH OTHER PEOPLE'S NATURAL HISTORY FILMS ALL THE TIME NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE AS A FILM MAKER 
I OUGHT TO BE AWARE OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE DOING 
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME 
THAT THEY ARE SOME OF THE MOST EXCITING AND REWARDING VIEWINGS YOU CAN HAVE 
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE DRAMATIC 
THEY ARE ABOVE ALL TRUE THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO SELL YOU ANYTHING 
THEY'RE NOT ABOUT A POLITICAL PARTY THEY ARE NOT TELLING YOU LIES 
THEY ARE ABOUT LIFE ITSELF AND IF YOU'VE 
AS DOCTOR JOHNSON SAID SOMEWHERE 
IF YOU'RE TIRED OF NATURAL HISTORY FILMS YOU'RE TIRED OF LIFE 
AND THAT IS A SENTIMENT I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH 
BUT I THINK I'D GO FURTHER 
I THINK I WOULD SAY THAT WILDLIFE AND HUMAN LIFE ARE INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED 
SO QUITE SIMPLY IF WE DON'T CARE FOR THE NATURAL WORLD 
WE DON'T CARE FOR OUR WORLD EITHER 
AND THAT TO ME IS THE ULTIMATE AIM 
THE HOPE THE PRAYER BEHIND EVERY WILDLIFE FILM 
IT IS TO MAKE US CARE AND SAY HERE'S SOMETHING WE LOVE 
WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT 
I KNOW OF NO PLEASURE DEEPER THAN THAT WHICH COMES FROM 
CONTEMPLATING THE NATURAL WORLD AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT
