WHO WENT ROUND THE COUNTRY DRAFTING MEN FOR SERVICE IN THE ROYAL NAVY 
TAR GETTERS PRESS GANG OR DRAGOONS 
DRAFTING'S AN INTERESTING CHOICE OF WORDS IT WAS MORE LIKE KIDNAPPING

PRESS GANG IS CORRECT

TRICKY MOMENT YOU HAVEN'T HAD THE BEST OF LUCK AS A TEAM 
WELL YOU'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO TWO

YOUR SECOND QUESTION ED GEORGE C. MARSHALL 
THE AMERICAN GENERAL WHO PROPOSED THE MARSHALL PLAN 
FOR REBUILDING EUROPE AFTER WORLD WAR TWO 
HELD WHICH OFFICIAL POSITION 
VICE PRESIDENT MAYOR OF NEW YORK OR SECRETARY OF STATE 
O. K. IT DOESN'T SOUND TO ME 
LIKE SOMETHING THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK WOULD PROPOSE 
AND I COULD GO TERRIBLY WRONG 
BUT I DON'T THINK HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT

DANELAW WAS THE AREA OF ANGLO SAXON ENGLAND 
BETWEEN THE THAMES AND WHICH OTHER RIVER 
THE RIVER TEES THE RIVER SEVERN OR THE RIVER NENE 
OH DEAR I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THE SEVERN I DON'T THINK IT WENT OVER 
AS FAR AS THAT BECAUSE DANELAW DIDN'T INCLUDE WESSEX 
I MEAN IT WOULD HELP IF I HAD ANY IDEA WHATSOEVER 
OF WHERE THE RIVER NENE WAS 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MY BRITISH GEOGRAPHY'S LIKE 
AND I'VE GOT ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHERE IT IS 
THERE'S A BIT OF GEOGRAPHY MIXED INTO THIS OF COURSE 
WHICH IS ALWAYS A KILLER FOR ME 
WELL THE TEES IS OBVIOUSLY QUITE FAR NORTH 
BUT AGAIN EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE PUSHING IT ASKING ME 
BECAUSE I THOUGHT DANELAW WAS MORE IN THE EASTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY 
AND TAPERED OFF THE FURTHER NORTH IT WENT 
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE RIVER NENE IS 
WELL THE TEES IS UP THERE ISN'T IT 
AND WHEN THE VIKINGS FIRST LANDED IN THE LATE EIGHTH CENTURY 
THEY CAME TO LINDISFARNE 
AS YOU ARE PROBABLY GUESSING THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN EDUCATED GUESS

WAS A KINGDOM IN WHICH CONTINENT 
BETWEEN THE SIXTH AND THE EIGHTH CENTURIES AD 
AS YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL I'M NOT EXACTLY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CONFIDENT ON THIS ONE 
SO IT'LL BE A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION 
I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE AFRICA 
AND NOW I'LL JUST GO INTO EUROPE OR SOUTH AMERICA 
I HOPE I'D HAVE HEARD OF IT IF IT WAS IN EUROPE 
I THINK I'M GOING TO SAY SOUTH AMERICA DERMOT 
O. K. AUSTRASIA BETWEEN THE SIXTH AND THE EIGHTH CENTURIES 
WAS A KINGDOM IN EUROPE ED EUROPE 
AUSTRASIA I BET YOU WERE THINKING OF THAT 
YES I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU CONSIDERED IT EGGHEADS 
AUSTRASIA IT MUST HAVE BECOME AUSTRIA 
IT MEANS WEST ASIA DOESN'T IT 
I THINK IT WAS A BIT FURTHER WEST 
IT WAS ONE OF THE PARTS THAT WENT ON TO MAKE UP 
THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE WHEN THAT BECAME 
SO WHEN CHARLEMAGNE'S EMPIRE BROKE UP IT BROKE INTO THREE KINGDOMS 
EACH OF HIS THREE SONS GOT ONE PART AND ONE OF THOSE WAS AUSTRASIA 
ONE OF THOSE WAS AUSTRASIA SO BORDERING EUROPE 
AND THE ANSWER THERE
