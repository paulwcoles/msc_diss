CONSERVATIVES WHETHER THEY SUPPORT 
THEM THEM THERE'S STILL CONFUSION OVER THE 
TEN P. TAX RATE CLIMB DOWN WILL THOSE 
AFFECTED GET BACK DATED 
COMPENSATION ARE THE REBELS 
SATISFIED SATISFIED THEY ALWAYS SING TO THE RAFTERS AT 
THE MILLENNIUM STADIUM IN CARDIFF

MAY FIRST WE WILL TALK TO PLAID 
CYMRU CYMRU DID YOU WALK TO WORK TODAY L. DID 
WELL PART OF THE WAY BUT IS THE 
DRIVE TO GET WORKERS OUT OF THEIR 
CARS ON REALISTIC FOR MOST PEOPLE'S 
BUSY LIVES 
QUITE A MIXTURE COMING UP IN THE 
NEXT THIRTY MINUTES THE KEEN EYED OF 
YOU WILL HAVE NOTICED WE CELEBRATED 
ALL THINGS ENGLISH YESTERDAY TO 
MARK SAINT GEORGE'S DAY 
IN THE INTERESTS OF BALANCE AND THE 
PRESERVATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM 
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE TO 
INVITE A WELSHMAN TODAY WE ARE 
JOINED FOR THE WHOLE OF THE SHOW BY 
PLAID CYMRU WHICH THEY'VE PUT UP 
PHONE ETHICALLY ON THE SCREEN FOR 
ME BECAUSE THEY THINK I'M AN IDIOT 
THEY MIGHT BE RIGHT 
THE M. P. FOR CARMARTHEN IS ADAM PRICE 
WELCOME TO THE DAILY POLITICS 
THANK YOU 
IT'S STILL THE BIG STORY 
IN WESTMINSTER TODAY THE ONGOING 
ROW ABOUT THE SCRAPPING OF THIS 
BOTTOM TEN P. TAX RATE ON INCOME THE 
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER 
ALISTAIR DARLING HAS GIVEN A 
STATEMENT TO CLARIFY WHETHER THE 
COMPENSATION TO THOSE AFFECTED WILL 
BE BACK DATED 
THE PACKAGE WILL BE BACK DATED YES 
OR NO 
PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE REMOVAL OF 
THE TEN P. BAND ARE DISPARATE BECAUSE 
THEY'RE AFFECTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
IT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT TO LOOK AT A RANGE OF 
MEASURES TO HELP THEM MY FOCUS IS 
TO ALLOW US TO OFFSET THE ALTHOUGHS 
FOR THE ABOLITION OF THAT BAND FOR 
THIS YEAR THAT'S WHAT ININEND TO DO DO THAT WAS ALISTAIR DARLING REPLYING 
TO GEORGE OSBORNE THE SHADOW 
CHANCELLOR IN THE HOUSE 
WE'RE NOW JOINED BUT OUR OWN 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ANNE 
ALEXANDER GOOD TO SEE YOU IN THE 
WARMTH OF THE STUDIO RATHER THAN 
STANDING OUT IN THE COLD AND THE 
RAIN RAIN THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAIL AS WITH 
EVERYTHING WITH GORDON BROWN THERE 
IS A LOT OF QUESTION MARKS BUT THE 
REBELLION IS STILL OVER 
IT LOOKS 
LIKE THEY'VE BEEN CALMED DOWN FOR 
NOW AT LEAST WE SPOKE TO IAN 
GIBSON A FEW MINUTES AGO HE THIS 
MORNING WAS TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLY 
TABLING A NEW AMENDMENT BECAUSE 
FRANK FIELD WITHDREW HIS YESTERDAY 
AS A RESULT OF THE CONCESSIONS HE 
GOT 
YES AS A RESULT OF THE GOT CONCESSIONS THAT WERE ANNOUNCED 
YESTERDAY IAN GIBSON IS NOT 
COMPLETELY HAPPY BUT HE HAS NO 
INTENTION RIGHT NOW TO TABLE A NEW 
AMENDMENT WE HAVE SPOKEN TO A 
HANDFUL OF OTHER M. P.'S ALL OF THEM WOULD 
HOPE TO DO THAT VERY SOON THE 
PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THE YOUNGER 
PEOPLE THOSE WHO ARE ON THE LOWER 
INCOMES BELOW TWENTY FIVE 
THEY DON'T GET 
TAX CREDITS 
ABSOLUTELY IT'S MORE 
COMPLICATED TO WORK OUT BACK DATING 
AND COMPENSATION FOR PEOPLE WHEN 
IT INVOLVES TAX CREDITS BECAUSE 
IT'S A COMPLICATED SYSTEM WHICH 
GORDON BROWN BROUGHT IN WE ARE NOT 
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN HOW THAT IS 
GOING TO WORK ALISTAIR DARLING 
SAID TODAY HIS PLAY ON WORDS IS 
INTERESTING THE LETTER HE SENT 
YESTERDAY TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 
TREASURY SLCK HE TALKED ABOUT 
OFFSETTING THE LOSSES THAT WOULD BE 
FELT BY THE PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY FIVE THE 
LOW EARNERS HE IS NOW TALKING 
ABOUT OFFSETTING THE LOSS FORCE 
THIS YEAR THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN 
SLIGHT MOVEMENT THIS MORNING ON 
THAT 
ISN'T THERE A DANGER ADAM THAT THIS IS BECOMING LIKE THE SCHESLICK 
HOLSTEIN QUESTION NOBODY COULD 
UNDERSTAND IT 
WE ARE HAVING A U. 
TURN ON THE U. TURN WE'RE ALL 
CONFUSED 
HA HA DOESN'T THAT MEAN CONFUSED YOU ARE BACK WHERE YOU STARTED 
POLITICALLY ABSOLUTELY 
A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY 
DEGREE TURN 
IF THERE WASN'T A 
LOCAL ELECTION NEXT THURSDAY LET'S 
BE HONEST THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN 
ANY CHANGE 
YOU AGREE WITH THE 
ASSUMPTION BEHIND THE DAVID CAMERON 
QUESTION YESTERDAY 
ENTIRELY THIS 
IS A CYNICAL A PLOY BY THE 
GOVERNMENT ONLY AT THE WEEKEND 
THEY CLAIMED THEY COULDN'T REOPENED 
THE BUDGET THREE DAYS LATER THEY 
HAVE REOPENED IT THAT IS 
UNRAVELLING IT'S A RIDICULOUS 
SYSTEM THE GOVERNMENT TIME AND 
TIME AGAIN TAX PEOPLE THEY TAKE 
THEIR MONEY AWAY AND GIVE YOU A 
LITTLE BIT BACK SURELY WHAT THEY 
DO IS LET PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES 
KEEP MORE OF THEIR INCOME 
I GET 
THE SENSE ANNE THAT THE REBELLION 
IS PROBABLY OVER IS IT NOT A SENSE 
THAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING M. P.'S ARE 
FEELING THIS IS BECOMING INCREDIBLY 
COMPLICATED A SIMPLE TAX CHANGE IS 
RESULTING IN ENDLESS NEW 
REGULATIONS AND THE DETAIL IS SO 
COMPLICATED IN THE END NONE OF US 
WILL UNDERSTAND IT 
THIS IS 
POSSIBLY WHY THE REBELLION HAS 
CALMED DOWN BECAUSE IT'S NOT 
UNDERSTOOD WHAT IS HAPPENING IN 
TERMS OF BACK DATING A COUPLE OF 
M. P.'S I SPOKE TO THIS MORNING SAID 
WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WE TRUST 
ALISTAIR DARLING WHEN HE SAYS HE 
WILL SORT IT OUT AND HE CAN'T GIVE 
US THE DETAILS UNTIL THE PRE BUDGET 
REPORT IN THE AUTUMN IT'S VERY 
COMPLICATED THERE IS STILL A LOT 
OF CONFUSION THAT IS TRUE TO SAY 
WE ARE CONFUSED TOO LESS CONFUSED 
THAN WE WERE FEW MINUTES AGO 
THANKS TO YOU ANNE 
WHILE THE BRAINS ARE WHIRRING IT'S 
TIME FOR OUR DAILY QUIZ WHICH OUR 
GUEST ADAM PRICE WE HOPE WILL BE 
ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION TODAY 
IS ACCORDING TO THE TWO THOUSAND ONE CENSUS 
I HOPE ADAM WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE US 
THE RIGHT ANSWER AT THE END OF THE 
SHOW BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
ANSWER IS THE QUIZ CAN BE FOUND AT 
OUR WEBSITE SEND US YOUR E. MAILS 
WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU 
THINK ABOUT TODAY'S TEACHERS' 
STRIKE THE ADDRESS IS 
DAILY.POLITICS AT B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U. K. DAILYPOLITICS AT B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U. K. I CHEAT AND LOOKED AT THE ANSWER 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
SCHOOLCHILDREN ARE MISSING OUT ON 
THE DAY'S EDUCATION TODAY IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES AS RESULT OF A 
STRIKE BY ONLY ONE TEACHING UNION 
THERE IS ABOUT TEN OF THEM BUT 
ONLY ONE IS ON STRIKE THE NATIONAL 
UNION OF TEACHERS IT'S OVER PAY 
AS USUAL THEY WANT A RISE OF JUST 
OVER FOUR PER CENT WHICH IS WHAT THE R. P. I. IS 
AT THE MOMENT THEY'VE BEEN OFFERED 
UNDER TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE PER CENT WHICH THEY SAY IS 
BELOW THE RATE OF I INFLATION 
AROUND THIRD OF SCHOOLS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES HAVE BEEN 
AFFECTED WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO 
THE NUT AND THE CONSERVATIVE 
SCHOOLS SPOKESMAN IN MOMENT BUT 
FIRST JO HAS THE DETAILS 
FOR ONCE KIDS UP AND DOWN THE 
COUNTRY HAVE RECEIVED NEWS THEY 
ACTUALLY WANTED TO HEAR FROM THEIR 
TEACHERS THEY'VE GONE ON STRIKE 
GIVING THEM AN EXTRA DAY TO GO OUT 
AND REAP MERRY HELL CHRISTINE 
BLOWER THE NUT HEAD GIRL AND HER 
NAUGHTY CLASSROOM GANG WANT TO 
TEACH ED BALLS AND GORDON BROWN 
LESSON A THIRD OF SCHOOLS ACROSS 
ENGLAND AND WALES ARE CLOSED TODAY 
THE NUT WANT MORE POCKET MONEY 
THEY'VE SAID NO WAY TO A THREE YEAR 
PAY DEAL OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE PER CENT THEY ARE 
DEMANDING RISE OF FORTY ONE PER CENT IT'S ONLY 
THE NUT WHO ARE BEING REBELLIOUS ON 
THIS ISSUE THE OTHER TEACHING 
UNIONS ARE NOT BOTHERED ONLY ONE 
THIRD OF NUT MEMBERS VOTED TEACH 
VERSE DONE PRETTY WELL UNDER THIS 
GOVERNMENT THEIR PAY HAS GONE UP 
NINETEEN PER CENT IN REAL TERMS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND 
THE AVERAGE TEACHER NOW EARNS 
THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND 
THANKS JO WE HOPE TO HAVE A TALK 
WITH SOMEONE FROM THE NUT IN A 
MOMENT MOMENT POLITICIANS THEY'VE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE BUT LET'S 
HAVE LOOK AT WHAT THE PUBLIC AND 
PARENTS THINK ABOUT THIS STRIKE WE 
SENT OUT OUR REPORTER MATT STADLEN 
TO A SCHOOL IN EAST LONDON 
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON 
IN A WAY GRANTED SOME TEACHERS DO 
DESERVE THE EXTRA BUT THERE ARE 
SOME TEACHERS THAT I DON'T THINK 
THEY SHOULD GET IT I DON'T THINK 
THEY DO ENOUGH FOR THE CHILDREN IN 
THE SCHOOL 
I'M WONDERING WHETHER THE BACK THE 
TEACHERS' STRIKE TOMORROW 
I DO 
ACTUALLY I THINK THEY DO GET 
UNDERPAID FOR WHAT THEY HAVE TO PUT 
UP WITH TO BE HONEST 
DO YOU FEEL 
THAT IT'S FAIR ON THE CHILDREN THE 
STRIKE 
NO L. DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR STRIKE ON THE CHILDREN BUT ON THE OTHER 
HAND HOW ELSE ARE THEY GOING TO 
PUT THEIR POINT ACROSS 
DO YOU 
SUPPORT THE TEACHERS' STRIKE 
TOMORROW 
I DO THEY'VE GOT SO MUCH TOMORROW WORK TO DO NOT ONLY THAT NO ONE 
EVER REALLY SEES WHEN THEY'VE 
FINISHED SCHOOL 
THE TEACHERS ARE 
ASKING FOR A PAY INCREASE OF FORTY ONE PER CENT 
THEY DESERVE TO GET A PAY RISE 
ESPECIALLY WITH WHAT THEY HAVE TO 
PUT UP WITH EVERY DAY I THINK 
TEACHERS DESERVE MORE MONEY 
BECAUSE THEY WORK REALLY HARD IT 
IS A HARD JOB IT DOES 
INCONVENIENCE PARENTS BUT IT IS A 
GOOD REASON BEHIND IT IT A GOOD 
IDEA AND A BAD IDEA 
WE CAN NOW GO TO OUR STUDIO AND 
TALK TO TIM HARRISON FROM THE NUT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US 
THE FIRST QUESTION TO ASK HOW 
ACCEPTABLE IS IT TO TAKE A DAY'S 
STRIKE ACTION WHEN CHILDREN ARE 
APPROACHING ONE OF THE BUSIEST 
TIMES OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR THESE THESE THINGS ARE A BALANCE MOST OF THE 
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING EXAMS 
CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TODAY AS A 
STUDY PERIOD WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S 
A DAMAGE TO CHILDREN THE NUT 
BELIEVES THAT CONTINUING DECLINING 
TEACHERS' PAY WHICH ALWAYS THEN IS 
FOLLOWED ON BY TEACHER SHORTAGES 
IS FAR MORE DAMAGING THAN ANYTHING 
WE ARE DOING TODAY 
WELL LET'S 
HAVE A LOOK AT THE FIGURES AND THE 
ACTUAL SUPPORT YOU HAVE GOT FOR 
THIS BALLOT A THIRD OF ALL OF THE 
MEMBERS VOTED IN THE BALLOT AND OF 
THOSE ONLY THREE QUARTERS ACTUALLY 
SUPPORTED THE IDEA OF STRIKE SOME 
WOULD SAY YOU DON'T HAVE A MANDATE 
FOR THIS 
WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A 
MANDATE CERTAINLY THE LAW ALLOWS 
US TO TAKE ACTION IN THE MAJORITY 
OF THOSE VOTING VOTE IN FAVOUR WE 
WOULDN'T HAVE DONE SO IF WE HADN'T 
TAKEN SURVEYS AS WELL NOT ONLY DO 
OUR MEMBERS SUPPORT THE POLICY OF 
THE NUT AND OUR ACTION BUT ALSO 
MANY MEMBERS OF OUR TEACHERS' 
UNIONS AS WELL TEACHERS ARE VERY 
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF DECLINING PAY AND 
ITS EFFECT ON THE EDUCATION SERVICE 
AND THEIR OWN SITUATION AT HOME 
WITH THEIR FAMILIES 
PARENTS OF 
SCHOOLCHILDREN WHO 
CHILDCARE ARRANGES FOR THEM TODAY 
WILL ARGUE THAT WE ARE ALSO 
SUFFERING FROM INCREASES IN FUEL 
PRICES IN FOOD PRICES AND NOT ON 
BIG SALARIES WHAT DO YOU SAY TO 
THEM 
I'D SAY TO THEM THEIR THEM BIGGEST PRIORITY AS A FAMILY IS A 
GOOD EDUCATION OF THEIR CHILDREN 
GOOD EDUCATION DEPENDS ON WELL 
MOTIVATED TEACHERS TEACHERS WHO 
ARE PAID ENOUGH TO LIVE IN THE 
COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY WORK 
WHAT IS NOT OFTEN THE CASE IN 
LONDON BUT ALSO A PROFESSION THAT 
CAN RECRUIT PEOPLE INTO IT WHAT WE 
KNOW FROM FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN 
TEACHERS' PAY DECLINED WE HAD TO 
SEARCH OVERSEAS FOR TEACHERS SOME 
SCHOOLS AND PARENTS WOULD HAVE 
CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS WHERE THERE MAY 
BE UP TO TWENTY SUPPLY TEACHERS IN A 
YEAR 
YOU TALK ABOUT DECLINING PAY YEAR PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE YOU HAVE HAD 
GOOD INCREASES SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHICH I 
MENTIONED BEFORE THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND IS A LOT 
TO SOME PEOPLE 
IT IS QUITE TRUE 
THAT THE PAY WAS INCREASED BY THIS 
GOVERNMENT S. WE DON'T DENY THAT 
AND THAT IS WHAT SOLVED THE TEACHER 
SHORTAGE PROBLEM AND IT'S WHAT HAS 
REMOTE VAITED TEACHERS AND WE ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE BOOM AND BUST 
POLICY OF ALL GOVERNMENTS WHO 
INCREASE TEACHERS' PAY WHEN THEY'RE 
IN TROUBLE AND LET IT DECLINE AGAIN 
UNTIL THEY'RE IN TROUBLE AGAIN 
ONCE WE CLIMB OUT OF THE DOWNTURN 
IN THE ECONOMY WE WON'T BE ABLE TO 
RECRUIT PEOPLE INTO THE PROFESSION 
THAT WILL MEAN TEACHER SHORTAGES 
SUPPLY TEACHERS AND SCOURING 
OVERSEAS FOR THEIR TEACHERS TOO 
TIM HARRISON FROM THE NUT THANK 
YOU YOU WE'VE HEARD FROM THE NUT AND SOME 
PARENTS NOW LET'S HEAR FROM THE 
TORIES NICK GIBB WELCOME TO THE 
DAILY POLITICS 
IN BROAD TERMS DOES YOUR PARTY 
SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT OR THE NUT 
WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT ON THIS 
IT'S NO WAY TO CONDUCT PAY 
NEGOTIATIONS TO GO ON STRIKE 
DISRUPTING CHILDREN'S PREPARATIONS 
FOR THEIR S. A. T. TESTS AND THE 
REVISION CLASSES FOR THE GCSES 
EXAMS IT'S DISRUPTIVE TO PARENTS 
IN HAVING TO FIND ALTERNATIVE 
CHILDCARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN BUT BUT SOMETHING IS WRONG IN TEACHING IF 
IT'S NOT WHAT THE NUT CHAP SAID 
THERE IT'S NOW THE SECOND MOST 
POPULAR GRADUATE PROFESSION IT'S 
NOT RECRUITMENT IT'S RETENTION IS 
THE PROBLEM SOMETHING IS WRONG IN 
THE TEACHING PROFESSION WHEN SO 
MANY PEOPLE WHO WE THE TAXPAYER 
HAVE PAID TO TRAIN PAID QUITE HIGH 
SALARIES NOW THEY THEN LEAVE WHAT 
WOULD YOU DO ABOUT THAT 
THERE ARE 
THREE TIMES MORE RESIGNATIONS THAN 
RETIREMENTS FROM THE TEACHING 
PROFESSION 
SO SOMETHING MUST BE PROFESSION DONE 
PAY IS NOT THE KEY FACTOR DONE THERE IF YOU WATCHED THE TEACHERS' 
CONFERENCES OVER THE EASTER IT'S 
THE BEHAVIOUR OF CHILDREN IN 
SCHOOLS DISCIPLINE 
NOT THE SINGLE SCHOOLS DISCIPLINE DISCIPLINE 
THE BIGGEST REASON YES DISCIPLINE YES A KEY FACTOR THE BODY LOOKED AT 
RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT AND SAID 
SALARYS WERE NOT A PROBLEM 
BEHAVIOUR IS A PROBLEM 
I KNOW 
THEY'VE HAD BIG RISES IN THE PAST 
THOUGH IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF 
THINGS THEY'RE NOT HUGELY PAID 
YOU WOULD BE HAPPY FOR THEM TO HAVE 
A PAY RISE WHICH IS CLOSER TO THE 
SMALL MEASURE OF INPOLICE STATION 
THE C. P. I. RATHER THAN THE ONE THAT 
REALLY AFFECTS US 
THE R. P. I. AGAIN AGAIN THE REVIEW BODY LOOKED AT THE 
DIFFERENT MEASURES OF INFLATION 
THEY THOUGHT THERE WERE PROS AND 
CONS IN EACH OF THE MEASURES THEY 
TOOK THIS INTO ACCOUNT WHEN 
CALCULATING THE PAY RISES WE LIVE 
IN TOUGH ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES 
RIGHT NOW 
LET ME ASK YOU TO LOOK 
FORWARD IF YOU WERE TO BECOME THE 
GOVERNMENT AND YOU HAVE A REFORM 
AGENDA FOR EDUCATION WHICH IN SOME 
WAYS IS MORE RADICAL THAN THE 
REFORM AGENDA OF THE BLAIR 
GOVERNMENT AND NOW THE BROWN 
GOVERNMENT HOW WOULD YOU EVER BE 
ABLE TO WORK WITH THE NUT GIVEN 
THAT THE NUT AMONG ALL OF THE 
UNIONS HAS RESISTED EVERY REFORM 
INTRODUCED BY A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE NUT 
THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION 
THEY DON'T AGREE WITH YOUR REFORMS 
WE CAN AGREE TO DIFFER AND THEY ARE 
FREE TO PUT THEIR VIEWPOINT TO THE 
MEDIA AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC BUT 
WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE 
SURE WE HAVE A VERY HIGH STANDARD 
OF EDUCATION 
HOW COULD YOU WORK 
TOGETHER WITH EVEN A LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
POURING BILLIONS OF POUNDS INTO THE 
EDUCATION SYSTEM EVEN THEY CAN'T 
WORK WITH THE NUT 
WE ARE GOING TO 
CONTINUED THIS GROWTH ON SPENDING 
IN EDUCATION WE SHARE A LOT OF 
CONCERNS THAT THE TRADE UNIONS WE 
ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT DISCIPLINE 
IN SCHOOLS IT HASN'T BEEN 
TACKLED 
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT TACKLED UNIONS I'M TALKING ABOUT THE NUT 
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES ON STRIKE 
TODAY I HAVE JUST WATCHED THEIR 
EASTER CONFERENCE SOME PEOPLE 
MAY THINK IT IS A DAVE SPARK 
GATHERING THERE SEEMS TO BE A 
TROTSKY ELEMENT TO IT SOCIALIST 
WORKER SEEM TO BE EVERYWHERE ARE 
YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU CAN GET 
YOUR TORY REFORMS THROUGH THE NUT 
YES BECAUSE 
THOSE PEOPLE THAT TEN THOSE CONFERENCES DON'T REPRESENT 
THE ORDINARY NUT MEMBERS IN SCHOOLS 
TWO MILLION TEACHERS ARE ON STRIKE 
TODAY SMALL PROPORTION OF NUT 
MEMBERSHIP MOST TEACHERS AND THE 
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS WANT 
TO TEACH AND THEY DON'T WANT TO 
TAKE INDUSTRIAL ACTION THEY WANT 
TO SEE A GOVERNMENT THAT'S GOING TO 
TAKE TOUGH ACTION TO DEAL THAT 
SCHOOL DISCIPLINE GIVING THE 
TEACHERS MORE POWER 
YOU WANT TO 
GIVE THE TEACHERS MORE POWER THE 
SCHOOL'S MORE POWER HEADMASTERS 
AND PARENTS MORE POWER WHY DON'T 
YOU END NATIONAL BARGAINING WHY 
DON'T YOU HAVE PAY BARGAINING OF 
WHICH THE HEADMASTER IN CHARGE OF 
THE SCHOOL AND THE HEADMASTER 
NEGOTIATE WITH THE TEACHERS IN HIS 
OR HER SCHOOL AND GETS THE PAY 
GRADES EXACTLY BESPOKE TO THEIR 
SCHOOL 
THIS BODY WAS SET UP IN SCHOOL NINETEEN NINETY ONE IT IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY UP 
WORKING OUT THE PAY NORMS 
ARE YOU 
IN FAVOUR OF LOCAL BARGAINING YES YES WE DON'T WANT THE SCHOOLS TO HAVE 
DISCRETION TO PAY ABOVE THE 
NATIONAL PAY NORMS 
ARE YOU IN 
FAVOUR OF LOCAL BARGAINING AS 
DESCRIBED BY ME 
NO FOR SCHOOLS 
WE WANT TO GIVE THEM MORE FREEDOM 
TO SET PAY BUT NATIONAL PAY NORMS 
WHEN THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF SAY 
MATHS TEACHERS OR SIGNS TEACHERS OR 
THEY WANT TO RECRUIT A PARTICULARLY 
WELL QUALIFIED TEACHERS THEY WILL 
HAVE THE DISCRETION IN OUR REFORMS 
TO PAY ABOVE THE NATIONAL PAY NORM 
SHOULD AND TEACHERS IN WALES WHERE 
CONDITIONS CAN BE DIFFERENT BIGGER 
RURAL COMMUNITIES AND LANGUAGE 
CONSIDERATIONS SHOULDN'T PAY THEIR 
BUT TEACHERS BE A MATTER FOR LOCAL 
DECISION 
IT'S AN INTERESTING POINT DECISION PAY FOR TEACHERS IN WALES IS IN 
DEVOLVED IT COVERS ENGLAND AND 
WALES 
THESE AGREEMENTS ARE ENGLAND WALES AND WALES 
YES WHEREAS IN SCOTLAND 
THERE AREN'T STRIKES BECAUSE THERE 
IS A SEPARATE AGREEMENT IF YOU GO 
DOWN THE ROUTE OF LOCAL PAY WHICH 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO DO AND 
PART OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THAT 
IS PART OF THE REASONS FOR THE 
STRIKE TODAY AND SOME OF THE 
BENEFITS OFFICERS THAT MAY BE A 
DANGEROUS ROUTE BECAUSE IN LOW WAGE 
PARTS OF THE U. K. YOU MAY HAVE 
PRESSURE TO HAVE LOW WAGES AND THAT 
COULD MAKE RECRUITMENT EVEN MORE 
DIFFICULT IN THOSE AREAS 
IF YOU 
GAVE POORER SCHOOLS MORE MONEY THEY 
WOULD HAVE MORE MONEY TO SPEND AND 
DECENT TEACHERS 
MAYBE SELECTIVELY 
IF YOU ARE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE 
OF THE WHOLE OF THE PROFESSION AND 
I THINK YOU NEED A STANDARDISED 
SYSTEM BUT THAT SHOULD CERTAINLY 
BE DIVORCED IN WALES 
HOW MANY 
MONTHS WITH A TORY GOVERNMENT IN 
POWER BEFORE YOU FACED THE FIRST 
CONFRONTATION OF THE NUT IN A 
RADICAL REFORM 
I DON'T BELIEVE WE 
WILL HAVE THOSE CONFRONTATIONS L. 
DON'T THINK THERE IS AN APPETITE TO 
GOING BACK TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND 
CONFRONTATION WITH THE CONSERVATIVE 
GOVERNMENT WE ARE COMMITTED TO 
RAISING STANDARDS ACROSS ALL 
SCHOOLS IN THE STATE SECTOR MOST 
TEACHERS SHARE THAT AMBITION IF IF YOU EVER GET TO POWER WE LOOK 
FORWARD TO MONITORING THAT 
RELATIONSHIP I'VE A FEELING IT 
WILL BE QUITE AS COSY IN GOVERNMENT 
AS IT IS IN OPPOSITION 
WE HAVE A FEW E. MAILS FOR ROUND ROUND YOU WILL PROBABLY BE AWARE BY NOW 
THAT LARGE PARTS OF ENGLAND AND 
WALES ARE HOLDING LOCAL COUNCIL 
ELECTIONS A WEEK TODAY TO BE 
PRECISE WE HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWING 
THE MAIN PARTY REPRESENTATIVES 
TODAY WE WILL LOOK AT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IN WALES WE WILL TALK TO 
OUR GUEST FROM PLAID CYMRU WHAT IS 
UP FOR GRABS THERE VOTERS WILL GO 
TO THE POLLS AT ALL TWENTY TWO WELSH 
COUNCILS PLAID CYMRU ARE DEFENDING 
JUST ONE GWYNEDD IN NORTH WEST 
WALES THE PARTY IS FIGHTING LABOUR 
FOR COUNCIL SEATS BUT HIS IN A 
RULING COALITION WITH THEM IN THE 
WELSH ASSEMBLY PLAID CYMRU IS THE 
LARGEST PARTY IN THE BUT ASSEMBLY 
WITH FIFTEEN OUT OF SIXTEEN MEMBERS IN 
WESTMINSTER THEY HOLD THREE AFTER 
FORTY WELSH SEATS YOU ARE IN 
COALITION WITH LABOUR IN THE 
ASSEMBLY AT THE MOMENT BUT YOU ARE 
FIGHTING THEM TOOTH AND NAIL IN THE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS FOR YOUR PARTY 
WHAT IS THE SINGLE ONE OF THE TWO 
MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES YOU ARE 
CAMPAIGNING ON 
I THINK IT HAS TO 
BE SAID THAT WESTMINSTER POLITICS 
STILL IS GOING TO PLAY VERY HARD IN 
THIS ELECTION THE TEN P. TAX RATE 
AND M. P.S' EXPENSES GENERAL 
ALIENATION FROM THE POLITICAL 
ESTABLISHMENT THERE WILL BE A LOT 
OF REFUGEES FROM THE LABOUR PARTY 
EX LABOUR VOTERS WHO ARE LOOKING TO 
REGISTER A PROTEST VOTE AND WE WILL 
HOPE TO BENEFIT FROM THAT AS THEY 
HAVE DONE IN PREVIOUS ELECTIONS I I UNDERSTAND BUT IT IF IT IS THE 
NATIONAL PICTURE RATHER THAN LOCAL 
SHOULD ANY BE DOING A LOT BETTER 
WE DON'T HAVE OPINION POLLS IN 
WALES WE'VE GOT NO NEWSPAPERS 
APART FROM THE WESTERN MAIL AND THE 
DAILY POST IF THE B. B. C. WANTS TO PAY 
FOR THE OPINION POLL WE WOULD 
WELCOME IT BECAUSE OUR INTERNAL 
POLLING SHOWS THAT WE'RE DOING AS 
WELL AS THE S. N. P. ARE DOING IN 
SCOTLAND WE ARE NECK AND NECK 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS EX LABOUR 
VOTERS DON'T WANT TO VOTE LABOUR 
BUT THEY CAN'T BRING THEMSELVES TO 
VOTE CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE OF THE 
MEMORY OF THE EIGHTIES 
I UNDERSTAND 
THAT BUT ALLAH AS I UNDERSTAND 
IT THE TORIES ARE DOING BETTER IN 
WALES ON THEY ARE IN SCOTLAND THAT 
MAY NOT BE A HIGH BENCHMARK BUT IN 
THE VALE OF GLAMORGAN MAY SEEM TO 
BE DOING WELL ANGLICISED PART OF 
WALES 
MOMENT MONMOUTH RICHER AND WALES THE VALE OF GLAMORGAN HAVE TENDED 
TO FOLLOW UP A MORE BRITISH PATTERN 
BUT IF YOU GO FURTHER WEST AND 
SOUTH THE PICTURE IS VERY DIFFERENT 
THAT'S WHERE PLAID CYMRU HAS 
TRADITIONALLY COMPETED HEAD TO HEAD 
WITH THE LABOUR PARTY 
YOU ARE A 
PARTY HE BELIEVES IF NOT IN 
OUTRIGHT INDEPENDENCE YOU BELIEVE 
IN MORE DEVOLUTION YOU BELIEVE IN 
MORE SELF GOVERNMENT FOR WALES DO 
YOU SAY IT IS ALL NATIONAL POLITICS 
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE BIG ISSUE 
WHICH YOU COULD SAY TO THE PEOPLE 
OF WALES LOOK IF WE RAN THIS 
OURSELVES WE WOULD DO BETTER I I THINK THE ECONOMY IS AT THE HEART 
OF ELECTIONS EVERYWHERE AT ALL 
TIMES IN WALES EVEN DURING THE 
GOOD TIMES 
EVEN IF YOU WERE 
INDEPENDENTS YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO 
RUN AT YOURSELF 
THAT'S TRUE WE 
HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME DURING 
THE LAST TEN YEARS WHICH WAS 
SUPPOSED TO BE THE GOOD TIMES WHEN 
ENGLAND CATCHES A COLD WALES GETS 
PNEUMONIA THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT WALES HAVE GOT SOME 
OF THE LOWEST WAGES IN THE U. K. 
THERE IS REAL CONCERN THERE 
PARTICULARLY A PRONK AMONG SOME 
TRADITIONAL LABOUR VOTERS IN IN CARDIFF AND PARTS OF SOUTH WALES IT 
LOOKS A PROSPEROUS MODERN 
PROGRESSIVE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TOWN IT'S 
EVEN WHERE DOCTOR WHO LIVES 
CARDIFF EUROPE'S YOUNGEST CAPITAL 
HAS REALLY COME ON IN LEAPS AND 
BOUNDS OVER THE LAST DECADE WALES 
IS CULTURALLY AND INCREASINGLY 
SELF CONFIDENT COUNTRY SWANSEA IS 
GOING TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
CARDIFF IN THE F. A. CUP FINAL AT AT NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 
CULTURE AND SPORTS WE NEED TO 
TRANSLATE THAT INTO POLITICS WHAT WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD RESULT FOR YOU 
WHAT YOU HOPE TO WIN 
IN A 
CONTROLLING GROUP OF FIVE COUNCILS 
WE WANT TO TAKE THAT UP TO EIGHT A A VETS HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT THE E. 
MAILS PARTICULARLY ON THE NUT 
STRIKE WHAT A BAD DAY FOR 
EDUCATION THIS IS SAYS DOSSER THE 
NUT HAVE CAUSED MORE DAMAGE TO 
EDUCATION IN THE LAST FORTY THAN ANY 
GOVERNMENT THEY ARE A DINOSAUR 
LEFT WING ORGANISATION THAT IS NOT 
REPRESENTATIVE OF TEACHERS AND THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE 
COLIN IN RUGBY I KNOW THAT HIS 
GOVERNMENT IS BIG ON SPIN BUT THIS 
GOVERNMENT HAS SO MANY CHANGES IN 
DIRECTION THAT MY HEAD IS STARTING 
TO SPIN THAT YOU ARE WATCHING THIS 
AT HOME YOU ARE NOT AT WORK BUT 
YOU COULD BE WORKING FROM HOME 
SO YOU DIDN'T WALK THERE ARE YOU 
CONFUSED I AM AND I'M READING 
THIS NEVER MIND ALONG WITH ALL OF 
THE OTHER CASES HAVE CLOSED SCHOOLS 
THIS MORNING THERE WAS A CAMPAIGN 
TO GET YOU TO WALK TO WORK IT IS A 
NICE IDEA BUT IS IT MOST 
UNREALISTIC FOR MOST BUSY PEOPLE 
JOE MANAGED TO DON HER TRENDY 
TRAINERS FOR HER WALK TO 
WESTMINSTER TODAY PARTON NINE TO FIVE SHE WEARS 
TO JOIN ME ABOUT TALKING TALK 
ABOUT WALKING TO WORK ARE OUR 
GUESTS WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME 
ME LOOKING VERY ENERGETIC THERE 
WHY IS IT SUCH A GOOD THING WE WE THINK WALKING HAS SO MANY BENEFITS 
THERE ARE SO MANY BIG ISSUES NOW 
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS VERY A POT 
APOCALYPTIC RHETORIC ABOUT 
CLIMATE CHANGE A PRESSING DANGER 
OF THE CITY IS GOING TO BE HUGE 
IT'S GOING TO COST FIFTY BILLION A 
YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTY 
NO ONE WOULD DISAGREE 
WITH THAT BUT IS IT PRACTICAL FOR 
THE MASSES OF US TO REALLY WALK TO 
WORK 
OUR VIEW IS THAT IT IS WORK PRACTICAL FOR MORE PEOPLE THAN 
CURRENTLY ARE DOING IT CLEARLY 
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE AND TRAVEL A 
LONG DISTANCE AND THEY CAN'T WALK 
FIFTY OR SIXTY MILES WHY NOT 
BUT OUR POINT IS THERE ARE LOTS OF 
PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY UP FOR 
ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT 
TAKES TO WALK TO PARTICULAR TYPE 
OF AREA AND UNDERESTIMATING TIME 
IT TAKES TO DRIVE THERE 
YOU SPEND 
A LOT OF TIME AROUND WESTMINSTER 
EASILY WALKABLE AROUND HERE IT'S IT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT L. DO USUALLY 
WALKED WORK THIS MORNING I DROVE 
AND GOT A PARKING TICKET LEARNED LEARNED THE LESSON WHY ARE YOU DRIVING 
BECAUSE I WAS MOVING SOME STUFF OUT 
OF MY HOUSE THERE WAS A REASON FOR 
IT BUT I STILL GOT A PARKING 
TICKET 
HE IS MOVING IN THE BAIJI TICKET DE GAULLE CHEEKY GIRL 
ARE YOU GOING TO WALK TO YOUR 
WEDDING 
I NEED TO GIVE YOU AN WEDDING INVITE DON'T I 
I WENT TO THE LAST 
ONE 
MOVING SWIFTLY ON L. WALK ONE SEVEN MILES A DAY L. USED TO WEAR 
AT THE DAMAGE HAD TO FIND OUT HOW 
MUCH IT WAS THAT JUST BY WALKING 
AROUND HERE QUITE CONSISTENTLY BUT BUT IS IT REALLY REALISTIC FOR PEOPLE 
TO DO IT ON A DAILY BASIS IF YOU'VE 
GOT TO DROP KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL GET 
TO WORK THEMSELVES L. CAN 
WALK THEM TO SCHOOL BUT I CAN'T THEN WORK WALK TO WORK 
THE SIMPLE ONE IS YES 
YOU CAN WALK TO WORK TO AN EXTENT 
EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO DRIVE A LOT OF 
IT YOU COULD PROBABLY PARKER BIT 
FURTHER AWAY SAVE YOUR TIME ON 
TAXIS AND STAFF BY WALKING THE 
COMPLICATED ONE IS THE COULD 
RESTRUCTURE SOCIETY IN THE LONGER 
TERM SO THAT IT'S MORE ECO FRIENDLY 
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL TO A 
CENTRAL PLACE WE COULD DO THAT 
WITH THE INTERNET PEOPLE COULD DO 
A LOT OF WORK FROM HOME PEOPLE'S PEOPLE'S HABITS ARE CHANGING THERE ARE SO 
MANY MORE CYCLISTS AROUND 
WESTMINSTER THAN THERE WERE TEN 
YEARS AGO BUT SAFETY IS AN ISSUE 
GENERALLY WALKING OR CYCLING YES YES OUR FOR LOSS PHILOSOPHY AT LIVING 
STREETS IS IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE 
SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORT WE ACTUALLY 
NEED TO HAVE SAFE CLEAN PLEASANT 
ENVIRONMENTS TO WALKABOUT IN 
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO WALK ROUND 
DIRTY AND UNSAFE NEIGHBOURHOODS
