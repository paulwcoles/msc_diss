THEY BELIEVE A DEAD MAN'S SPIRIT CAN COME AFTER THEM FROM THE GRAVE 
IT'S ME YOU'RE TALKING TO GRACE IT'S ME 
SOMETHING HORRIBLE'S HAPPENED HERE 
AGH YOU ALL RIGHT 
BLOOD WAS FOUND ON A SHAWL THAT WAS AT THIS GRAVE O. K. 
HATRED DOESN'T BIND IT EATS AWAY IT DESTROYS LISTEN TO THIS 
SIR 
HELLO AGAIN AFTER A SUNNY NIGHT WE'VE GOT A STARRY NIGHT IN THE U. K. 
THAT LEADS US INTO ANOTHER SUNNY DAY TOMORROW PLENTY MORE TO COME 
NO SIGN OF ANYTHING UNSETTLED UNTIL THE SECOND HALF OF THE SECOND WEEK 
A LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD SPILLING UP ACROSS MORE WESTERN AREAS 
MADE THE SUNSHINE A LITTLE HAZY AND SOME LOWER CLOUD 
FROM THE NORTH SEA AND IT BECOMES A LITTLE MORE EXTENSIVE TONIGHT 
ACROSS THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND AND EASTERN SCOTLAND 
ELSEWHERE CLEAR SKIES A LITTLE SHOWER IN FAR NORTH WEST SCOTLAND 
TEMPERATURES AROUND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN DEGREES IN MUCH OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
COULD BE A COOL AND A GREY START ACROSS NORTHUMBERLAND 
AND YORKSHIRE AS FAR AS THE HUMBER 
FURTHER SOUTH BACK INTO THOSE BRIGHT BLUE SKIES ONCE AGAIN 
LOVELY START TO THE DAY WITH SUNSHINE AROUND FROM THE WORD GO 
TEMPERATURES PICKING UP QUICKLY A LITTLE BREEZE FROM THE EAST 
SUNSHINE RIGHT DOWN ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST INTO WALES TOO 
ACTUALLY THE WESTERN SIDE OF WALES AROUND CARDIGAN BAY 
COULD BE A BIT WARMER TOMORROW THAN AT THE WEEKEND NO ON SHORE BREEZES 
A LITTLE FRESH ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND BUT DRY WITH SOME SUNSHINE 
SHOWERS MAYBE ACROSS THE HEBRIDES SOME WESTERN PARTS OF SCOTLAND 
BUT THEY SHOULD DIE AWAY FAIRLY QUICKLY 
SO FOR MOST OF US A DRY DAY AND A SUNNY DAY 
BUT WATCH OUT FOR THE EAST COAST WITH MISTY LOW CLOUD FROM OFF 
THE NORTH SEA AN OCCUPATION HAZARD AT THIS TIME OF YEAR 
INLAND TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW TO MID TWENTIES 
NEWCASTLE MIGHT STRUGGLE A LITTLE FIFTEEN DEGREES MAYBE 
AND ALWAYS PECKING AWAY AT THAT EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND 
THE ODD SHOWER IN THE NORTH WEST HIGHLANDS BUT NOTHING THUNDERY 
A DRY DAY IN NORTHERN IRELAND TWENTY TWO DEGREES VERY PLEASANT IN BELFAST 
THAT SUNSHINE KEEPS GOING ACROSS WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
LITTLE BIT OF HIGH CLOUD MAYBE BUT ESSENTIALLY A BLUE SKY SORT OF DAY 
TEMPERATURES TWENTY TO TWENTY TWO DEGREES 
PATCHY CLOUD DEVELOPING INLAND FROM THE SOUTH COAST NOT MUCH THOUGH 
MORE OF A BREEZE PUSHING IN FROM THE EAST 
TO KNOCK THE TOP OFF TEMPERATURES AND THAT SAME EASTERLY BREEZE 
WILL PRODUCE SOME LOW CLOUD ALL THE WAY DOWN EAST SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND 
AS FAR AS THE WASH WITH A COOLER NIGHT SIX OR SEVEN DEGREES 
IN SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN ENGLAND NOT AS WARM FURTHER SOUTH EITHER 
INTO TUESDAY MORE OF A BREEZE COMING IN TOPPING OUT AT TWENTY ONE DEGREES 
WITH STILL SOME MIST AND LOW CLOUD NEAR THE EAST COAST 
LOOKING AHEAD TO THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK TEMPERATURES HIGH TEENS 
WE'RE GETTING SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR FROM THE EAST OR NORTH EAST 
A SLIGHT BREAKDOWN IN THIS FINE WEATHER IN THE SOUTH WEST 
ON WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY BUT BEFORE THAT PLENTY OF SUNSHINE 
WHEN I PUT MY FOOT ON THE THROTTLE THE ENGINE WAS SLUGGISH NO POWER AT ALL IN IT 
MATT HAD TO TAKE THE CAR BACK TO CARCRAFT FOUR TIMES BUT THE PROBLEMS CONTINUED
