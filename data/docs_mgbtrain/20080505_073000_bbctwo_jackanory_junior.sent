THIS IS JACKANORY JUNIOR 
HELLO 
I'M MARTIN 
THIS IS THE STORY OF ME AND MY DOG ROO 
AND OUR INCREDIBLE JOURNEY ACROSS AMERICA 
THIS IS HOW OUR ADVENTURE STARTED 
WE WERE GOING TO AMERICA IN SEARCH OF ROO'S GRANDFATHER 
AND INCREDIBLE DOG BY ALL ACCOUNTS 
THE LAST ROO HEARD OF HIM 
HE WAS A COWBOY'S DOG AND LIVED SOMEWHERE IN THE WILD WEST 
OF COURSE I ONLY HAVE ROO'S WORD FOR THAT 
IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND THE WILD WEST ANY MORE 
BUT THE GET LOST TRAVEL AGENCY WERE MOST HELPFUL 
THEY SOLD ME TWO TICKETS FOR A FOURTEEN DAY TOUR 
TRAVELLING ON A GREYHOUND BUS TO SOME OF AMERICA'S BEST ATTRACTIONS 
I BORROWED UNCLE FREDDY'S NEW GOLF TROLLEY TO CARRY OUR EQUIPMENT IN 
WHEN OUR PLANE LANDED OUR TOUR OF AMERICA BEGAN 
BUT THERE WAS A DREADFUL MISTAKE 
THE TICKETS I BOOKED WERE FOR THE FAMOUS GREYHOUND BUS 
NOT A BUS FULL OF GREYHOUNDS 
ROO WAS NOT USUALLY GOOD WITH OTHER DOGS 
TO DISTRACT ROO FROM THE GREYHOUNDS 
I GOT HER TO DESCRIBE HER GRANDFATHER 
FIRST ROO SAID HE HAD A BIG NOSE WHICH IS NOT MUCH USE AT ALL 
THEN SHE SAID THAT HE WAS HAIRY BUT MOST DOGS ARE HAIRY 
I ASKED HER TO BE MORE SPECIFIC AND SHE SAID HE HAD A BIG TAIL 
REALLY IT IS USELESS 
WE ARRIVED AT A PLACE CALLED THE SILVER WHIPPET RACETRACK 
APPARENTLY THE GREYHOUNDS WERE TAKING PART IN A RACE 
THAT AFTERNOON 
WE STOOD RIGHT NEXT TO THE TRACK TO WATCH THE RACE 
THE DRIVER'S DOG SLOWCOACH LOOKED QUITE FAST 
AND CAME OUT OF THE TRAP WITH A GOOD BURST OF SPEED 
I HAD TO HOLD ROO VERY TIGHT 
AS SHE WAS SQUIRMING IN MY ARMS WITH EXCITEMENT 
OLD SLOWCOACH WAS MILES AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE FIELD 
WHEN ROO LEAPT OUT OF MY ARMS 
AND POUNCED ON THE ELECTRIC RABBIT AS IT FLEW PAST 
SHE HUNG ON FOR AGES 
I COULD HARDLY BEAR TO WATCH AS SHE WHIZZED ROUND THE TRACK 
THEN THE ELECTRIC RABBIT SHORT CIRCUITED 
AND ROO FELL OFF 
THE NEXT DAY WE WENT TO A THEME PARK CALLED RABBIT WORLD 
U. N. H. U. N. H. 
A MAN IN A RABBIT SUIT MET US AT THE GATE AND TOOK OUR MONEY 
THE PLACE WAS CRAMMED WITH DOGS 
AND WE HAD TO QUEUE FOR A LONG TIME TO GET ON THE RIDES 
MY FAVOURITE WAS A ROLLERCOASTER RIDE CALLED THE BIG HOPPER 
WE CLIMBED INTO A BOAT SHAPED LIKE A GIANT CARROT 
AND THEN SHOT DOWN A SERIES OF WHITE WATER RAPIDS 
AT THE BOTTOM WE WERE CATAPULTED ACROSS A LAKE 
ROO LOVED IT AND WENT ON IT THREE TIMES 
SHE SAID IT WAS HER FAVOURITE PLACE IN THE WHOLE WORLD 
I ACTUALLY MANAGED TO DRAG HER AWAY 
ONLY TO FIND THAT OUR BUS HAD GONE WITHOUT US 
HUHHH 
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HITCHHIKE WITH A DOG 
EVERY CAR THAT DID SLOW DOWN WAS SOON DRIVEN AWAY AT HIGH SPEED 
WHEN PEOPLE SAW ROO WITH ME HEY DOWN 
I DECIDED TO HIDE HER BEHIND THE GOLF TROLLEY 
AND THIS SEEMED TO WORK 
COS A LARGE CAMPER VAN STOPPED 
AND A VERY PLEASANT COUPLE CALLED BOB AND MIRIAM 
INVITED ME TO RIDE WITH THEM TO THE GRAND CANYON 
WE PITCHED THE TENT IN A CLEARING AND MADE OUR EVENING MEAL 
ROO CRUNCHED ON A BONE UNDER THE TABLE 
AND CAME OUT ONLY TO TELL US ABOUT HER GRANDFATHER 
ABOUT HOW HE HAD LIVED IN A CAVE WITH AN OLD BEAR 
AND HE SMELT SO BAD HE COULD CLEAR A WHOLE TOWN BY WALKING THROUGH IT 
I TOLD ROO BILL AND MIRIAM DID NOT WANT TO HEAR 
ANY MORE HORRIBLE STORIES ABOUT HER GRANDFATHER 
THIS CAUSED HER TO GO INTO A SULK AND BEFORE I COULD STOP HER 
SHE HAD SLUNK OFF INTO THE FOREST 
I HOPED SHE WAS ALL RIGHT 
I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT ROO DID COME BACK 
FOLLOWED BY TWO VERY ANGRY SKUNKS 
OH 
A DREADFUL SMELL AND MOST OF IT MANAGED TO GET ON ROO'S COAT 
SHE TRIED TO GET IT OFF BY ROLLING ON MY CLOTHES 
I HAD TO WASH HER IN THE LAKE 
I TOOK HER BACK TO THE CAMPER VAN 
AND EXPLAINED TO BILL AND MIRIAM ABOUT THE SKUNK INCIDENT 
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SAID TO UPSET THEM 
BUT THEY ROLLED THE WINDOWS UP AND DROVE OFF VERY FAST 
LEAVING US BEHIND 
I DID NOT SLEEP WELL THAT NIGHT 
SOMETHING WAS RUMMAGING ABOUT OUTSIDE THE TENT 
I WAS CERTAIN THAT IT WAS A BEAR ROO SLEPT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING 
BUT IN THE MORNING WHAT A MESS 
THE NEXT NIGHT I WAS AWOKEN BY AN ALMIGHTY CRASH 
THE BEAR WAS BACK 
I CANNOT DESCRIBE MY JOY WHEN I SAW THAT IT WAS NOT A BEAR 
BUT MY OWN DEAR ROO 
SHE WAS VERY MUDDY AND HER COAT WAS IN A TERRIBLE MESS 
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT HER FIGHT WITH THE BEAR 
WHAT A BRAVE DOG 
WHEN MORNING CAME I VENTURED OUT ARMED WITH A GOLF CLUB 
IN CASE THE BEAR WAS WOUNDED AND READY TO ATTACK 
THERE WAS NO DEAD BEAR STRETCHED OUT ON THE GROUND 
INSTEAD LYING ON ITS BACK IN THE MIDST OF MUCH WRECKAGE 
WAS A SMALL DUCK 
I LIFTED THE DUCK UP AND IT GAVE A FEEBLE QUACK 
THIS BROUGHT ROO OUT OF THE TENT 
WHEN SHE SAW THE DUCK SHE BOLTED BACK INSIDE 
IT HAS ALL BECOME VERY CLEAR TO ME NOW 
A BEAR INDEED 
HMM 
QUACK QUACK 
NEXT DAY WE CAME UPON ONE HORSE TOWN 
ONE HORSE IS NOT VERY BIG 
I FOUND A SALOON CALLED GROGMANS 
A GENERAL STORE AND A DINER CALLED THE HUNGRY HORSE 
WE TOOK A ROOM OVER THE SALOON 
THE OWNER CHARGED ME TWO DOLLARS EXTRA FOR ROO 
AND FIFTY CENTS FOR THE DUCK 
NEXT MORNING I WAS WOKEN BY THE SOUND OF MANY HOOVES 
I STAGGERED TO THE WINDOW TO SEE A BIG HERD OF HORSES 
GALLOPING UP MAIN STREET 
THESE HORSES WERE A COMPLETE NUISANCE 
THEY CALLED THEMSELVES THE RIDERLESS HORSES 
THE OLD SHERIFF GOT SO FED UP CHASING AFTER THEM 
HE MOVED AWAY AND OPENED A CAT FOOD SHOP IN CATVILLE 
NOW ONE HORSE HAD NO SHERIFF 
AND THE RIDERLESS HORSES COULD RUN RIOT ALL DAY LONG 
THAT EVENING THERE WAS A BIG FIGHT OUTSIDE THE HUNGRY HORSE 
IT WENT ON FOR OVER AN HOUR 
AND THEN SUDDENLY THEY STOPPED AND WENT INSIDE FOR SOMETHING TO EAT 
THEN THEY CAME OUT AND STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN 
ROO WATCHED THE WHOLE THING FROM THE BALCONY 
AND AT ONE POINT JUMPED OFF AND JOINED IN WITH THEM 
NEXT DAY BAD NEWS 
THE RIDERLESS HORSES ELECTED ROO AS THE NEW SHERIFF 
I THOUGHT IT WAS RIDICULOUS 
ROO SAID HER BREED WAS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE 
BEING RENOWNED AS SHERIFFS 
WHAT NONSENSE THERE ARE POLICE DOGS IT'S TRUE 
BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A SHERIFF DOG 
ROO WAS NOT EVEN A VERY GOOD SHERIFF 
THE POSITION WENT TO HER HEAD 
SHE SPENT HER TIME SWAGGERING UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET 
FOLLOWED BY THE DUCK WHO SEEMS TO HAVE APPOINTED ITSELF HER DEPUTY 
HOW CAN A TOWN BE GOVERNED BY A DOG AND A DUCK 
THE NEXT DAY MORE BAD NEWS 
ROO WAS NO LONGER THE SHERIFF OF ONE HORSE SHE GOT SACKED 
FOR LETTING THE RIDERLESS HORSES ROB THE HUNGRY HORSE 
IT WAS RUMOURED A DOG AND DUCK WERE SEEN CARRYING FOOD OUT OF THE DINER 
WORSE SHE WAS NOW CONSIDERED AN OUTLAW 
AND THERE WAS EVEN A WANTED POSTER OF HER OUTSIDE THE SALOON 
IT WAS HARD TO RECOGNISE IT AS ROO 
AS SOMEONE HAD DRAWN A MOUSTACHE ON HER 
WE SNEAKED OUT OF TOWN 
WE TRAVELLED ALL DAY 
AND AT LAST FOUND OURSELVES INSIDE A CAVE 
IT WAS SNOWING 
AND THE SOUND OF THE WIND IN THE TREES WAS LONELY AND TERRIBLE 
ROO AND THE DUCK SNUGGLED BESIDE ME IN THE SLEEPING BAG 
I HAD NO IDEA WHERE WE WERE 
LOST IN THE WILDERNESS OF AMERICA 
I FELT A LITTLE SCARED 
BUT I COULD FEEL ROO BESIDE ME IN THE DARKNESS 
I WAS WITH MY DOG AND I WAS HAPPY 
AS WE LAY IN THAT CAVE BY THE DYING EMBERS OF THE FIRE 
ROO WHISPERED THAT SHE WANTED ME TO SING HER A SPECIAL SONG 
I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AS I HAVE DONE SINCE SHE WAS A PUPPY 
AND I SANG TO HER 
I HAVE A DOG AND HER NAME IS ROO 
BET YOU FIVE DOLLARS SHE'S A GOOD DOG TOO 
YES I HAVE A DOG AND HER NAME IS ROO 
SHE'S THE BEST OLD DOG I EVER KNEW 
I HAD JUST FINISHED THE FIRST VERSE 
ABOUT TO SING THE BIT ABOUT THE RABBITS SHE HAD CHASED 
WHEN I THOUGHT I HEARD MUSIC ON THE WIND 
ROO AND THE DUCK COULD HEAR IT TOO 
THERE 
I HAVE A DOG AND HIS NAME IS BLUE 
I BET YOU TEN DOLLARS HE'S BETTER THAN ROO 
YES I HAVE A DOG AND HIS NAME IS BLUE 
HE'S THE BEST OL' DOG THAT I EVER KNEW 
WE SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE CAVE AS FAST AS WE COULD 
AND LOOKED OUT ACROSS THE CLEARING 
THERE SEATED ON A FALLEN PINE TREE WAS AN OLD MAN STRUMMING A BANJO 
AT HIS FEET WAS AN OLD GREY DOG 
ROO STARTED TO BARK AND THE OLD DOG LOOKED OVER AND BEGAN BARKING TOO 
WELL I'VE NEVER SEEN ROO SO HAPPY 
SHE RAN ROUND AND ROUND IN CIRCLES 
AND SPRANG ACROSS A STREAM TOWARDS THE OLD DOG 
THE TWO DOGS JUMPED ON EACH OTHER ROLLING AND TUMBLING IN THE SNOW 
LICKING EACH OTHER'S FACES AND WAGGING THEIR TAILS SO MUCH 
I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT TAKE OFF 
WE HAD FOUND ROO'S GRANDFATHER 
OR OLD BLUE AS HE LIKED TO BE CALLED 
THE OLD MAN WHOSE NAME WAS TED 
RECKONED THAT OLD BLUE WAS FIFTEEN WHICH IS VERY OLD FOR A DOG 
OLD BLUE INTERRUPTED AND SAID THAT HE WAS EXACTLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN DOG YEARS 
AT LAST OLD BLUE GREW TIRED 
AND LAY DOWN TO TAKE A NAP 
NOW I KNOW WHERE ROO GETS HER SNORING FROM 
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS WE HARDLY SAW ROO AND OLD BLUE AT ALL 
THEY HAD A LOT OF DOG STUFF TO DO IT SEEMS 
AND SPENT A LONG TIME DIGGING IN RABBIT HOLES 
I LIKED IT THERE BUT I BEGAN TO WISH I WAS BACK HOME 
THE SNOWS BEGAN AGAIN 
COVERING THE WHOLE WOOD IN A THICK WHITE BLANKET 
THAT EVENING I SAID I WISH WE HAD A TELEPHONE 
SO WE COULD CALL UP THE RESCUE SERVICES TO COME AND GET US 
OLD BLUE SAID HE COULD CALL THEM WITHOUT A PHONE 
REALLY WHAT NONSENSE I WENT TO BED 
ROO AND BLUE WENT OUTSIDE 
TO SEND THEIR MESSAGES TO THE RESCUE SERVICES 
UP AGAINST A TREE 
WOOF WOOF WOOF 
THE NEXT DAY I WOKE UP TO THE SOUND OF MUCH BARKING 
THE SHACK WAS SURROUNDED BY RESCUE DOGS 
WE'VE BEEN SAVED 
GOOD OL' BLUE 
A POLICE DOG TOOK ALL OUR DETAILS 
AND SAID A HELICOPTER WAS ON ITS WAY TO FLY US TO LOS ANGELES 
TED PROMISED TO LOOK AFTER THE DUCK FOR US 
THE DUCK SEEMED MORE THAN HAPPY TO STAY 
I THANKED TED FOR HIS HOSPITALITY A TEARFUL GOODBYE FOLLOWED 
BLUE EXPLAINED TO ROO HE WAS NEVER FAR AWAY NO MATTER WHERE SHE WAS 
ALL SHE HAD TO DO WAS BARK AND HE WOULD FIND HER 
THIS MADE HER FEEL A LOT BETTER 
THEN THEY CHASED EACH OTHER AROUND IN A CIRCLE FOR THE LAST TIME 
I THINK THAT MUST BE A DOG'S WAY OF SAYING GOODBYE 
AT LAST ALL OUR FAREWELLS WERE MADE 
THE HELICOPTER LANDED BESIDE TED'S SHACK 
OLD BLUE AND TED WATCHED AS WE CLIMBED ABOARD 
THE PILOT TOLD THEM TO STAND BACK AND STARTED THE ENGINES 
AS WE PULLED HIGH ABOVE THE TREES 
I COULD SEE OLD BLUE BARKING AND RUNNING AROUND IN THE SNOW 
HE SEEMED TO HAVE WRITTEN SOMETHING IN THE SNOW WITH HIS TRACKS 
IT TOOK A MOMENT FOR ME TO WORK OUT WHAT IT SAID 
WOOF WOOF 
I LOVE ROO WOOF WOOF 
AND SO DO I 
SEE YOU SOON
