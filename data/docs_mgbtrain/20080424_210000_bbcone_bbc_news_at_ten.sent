YOU WILL BE OUR TARGET UNTIL YOU 
HAVE STOPPED THE BOMBING GASSING 
IMPRISONMENT AND TORTURE OF MY 
PEOPLE WE WILL NOT STOP THIS FIGHT 
WE ARE AT WAR AND I AM A SOLDIER 
THEN THE POLICE REALISE THEY 
ALREADY HAD PICTURES OF HIM HE IS 
SEEN HERE SECOND FROM THE RIGHT IN 
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE FILMED SIXTEEN 
MONTHS BEFORE SEVEN SEVENTHS 
AS MANY AS EIGHT THOUSAND SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND 
AND WALES WERE AFFECTED BY TODAY'S 
STRIKE BY MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL 
UNION OF TEACHERS THEY ARE HAPPY 
WITH A THREE YEAR PAY DEAL WHICH 
THEY SAY FAILS TO KEEP PACE WITH 
INFLATION THE PRIME MINISTER SAID 
THE STRIKE WAS REGRETTABLE THE 
UNION ORGANISED DOZENS OF RALLIES 
AND DOES NOT RULE OUT MORE STRIKES 
THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE NOT SEEN 
IN MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS SNAKING 
THROUGH THE CAPITAL THOUSANDS OF 
TEACHERS WHO HAVE WALKED OUT OF 
SCHOOL IN THEIR FIRST NATIONAL 
STRIKE OVER PAY SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
THIS IS WHY THEY ARE ANGRY THAT 
WHILE THEIR PAY HAS IMPROVED IN THE 
PAST IT IS NOW BEING EATEN AWAY BY 
INFLATION AND RISING LIVING COSTS 
WE DESERVE FAIR PAY WE WORK REALLY 
HARD WE WORK IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR 
AND DESERVE TO BE PAID ABOVE THE 
RATE OF INFLATION 
I NEVER THOUGHT 
I WOULD WALK IN STRIKE WE HAVE 
BEEN LEFT WITH NO CHOICE 
I ACROSS 
ENGLAND AND WALES THIS WAS THE 
RESULT LIKE HERE IN PLYMOUTH 
NORMALLY BUSY CLASSROOMS LAY EMPTY 
IN A THIRD OF SCHOOLS FAMILIES 
WERE DISRUPTED AS A MILLION PUPILS 
STAYED HOME PARENTS LIKE RACHEL 
WERE FORCED TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK 
TO LOOK AFTER HER ELDEST SON SHE 
HAS LOST A DAY'S WAGES 
YOU GET 
USED TO YOUR BUDGET AND LIVE BY 
THAT AND KNOW YOU WILL HAVE SOME 
LEFT EVERY WEEK THIS WEEK THE 
SHOPPING WILL NOT BE WHAT IT 
USUALLY IS 
MANY SCHOOLS MANAGE TO 
STAY OPEN BY COMBINING PUPILS INTO 
GIANT CLASSES LIKE THIS ONE IN 
ESSEX BUT FOR THOSE PREPARING FOR 
EXAMS THE STRIKE COULD NOT HAVE 
COME AT A WORSE TIME 
AS MUCH AS 
THEY HAVE GOT THE RIGHT TO GO ON 
STRIKE WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN 
EDUCATION WE ARE IT AT AN 
IMPORTANT TIME AT MOCK GCSES THIS 
WEEK AND IT IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE 
TIME 
A FEW THAN HALF TEACHES TOOK TIME PART IN TODAY'S STRIKE MOST 
REMAINED IN THE CLASSROOMS AS THEY 
BELONG TO OTHER UNIONS THAT HAVE 
ALREADY ACCEPTED THE PAY OFFER 
DESPITE THE STRENGTH OF FEELING 
OVER PAY THE TEACHING PROFESSION 
AS A WHOLE IS FAR FROM UNITED OVER 
THIS STRIKE ACTION MAKING 
CONCESSIONS UNLIKELY THIS IS A 
SELFISH ACTION BACKED BY A SMALL 
MINORITY IF NOT A TINY MINORITY 
NO IT IS NOT SELFISH THE FACT IS 
THAT IF TEACHERS DO NOT SEE A FAIR 
RETURN FOR THE HARD WORK THEY DO 
AND IT IS GREAT JOB BUT IF THEY 
DO 
NOT SEE FAIR RETURN THEY WILL NOT COME INTO TEACHING POLITICIANS POLITICIANS ACROSS THE BOARD CONDEMNED THE 
STRIKE ARGUING IT WAS NOT 
JUSTIFIABLE 
PARENTS ACROSS THE JUSTIFIABLE COUNTRY WILL BE ANNOYED AND ANGRY 
TO SEE SCHOOLS BEING CLOSED TODAY 
MANY TEACHERS WILL FEEL THE SAME 
THING AS WELL AND I SHARE THEIR 
FRUSTRATION 
FURTHER STRIKES ARE FRUSTRATION POSSIBLE IF THE NUT BALLOT ITS 
MEMBERS RAISING THE PROSPECT OF 
ONGOING DISRUPTION IN SCHOOLS FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN A GENERATION 
AT THE HEART OF THE TEACHERS' CASE 
IS THE CLAIM THAT THEIR PAY DEALS 
ARE NOT PAY RISES BUT PAY CUT THEY 
POINT TO BIG INCREASES IN THE COST 
OF ENERGY AND FOOD AND SAY THE TRUE 
RATE OF INFLATION IS MUCH HIGHER 
THAN THE MEASURE BEING USED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT HUGH PYM IS HERE TO 
ANALYSE THE 
FIGURES 
ANALYSE THE FIGURES THERE ARE PAY PRESSURES BECAUSE THE 
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO KEEP OVERALL 
PAY SECTOR PRIVATE SECTOR PAY 
RISES TO JUST ABOVE TWO PER CENT TEACHERS 
HAVE BEEN OFFERED TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE PER CENT PART OF A 
THREE YEAR DEAL WITH A LITTLE LESS 
FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS THE 
NUT SAYS IT WANTS FOR OH ONE PER CENT THE 
REASON FOR THAT IS INFLATION ON 
THE GOVERNMENT'S MEASURE C. P. I. IT 
IS AT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT BUT ON A WIDER MEASURE 
R. P. I. WHICH INCLUDES HOUSING COSTS 
INFLATION IS AT THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT THE UNION 
SAYS THAT IS THE FAIR BENCHMARK FOR 
PAY RISES POLICE OFFICERS MOUNTED 
PROTESTS EARLIER THIS YEAR OVERALL 
ONE POINT NINE PER CENT PAY AWARD THAT IS WHAT IT 
AMOUNTED TO AFTER A DEAL WAS PHASED 
IN PRISON OFFICERS HAVE BEEN 
AWARDED TWENTY TWO PER CENT THERE HAS BEEN NO 
REPEAT OF THESE SCENES LAST YEAR 
NURSES WERE OFFERED TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT WITH 
LESS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS SOME 
UNIONS HAVE WELCOMED THAT OTHERS 
HAVE NOT IT IS EASY TO HARK BACK 
TO THE WINTER OF DISCONTENT AND THE 
CRIPPLING STRIKES OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
THERE IS NO SUGGESTION THAT WILL 
HAPPEN AGAIN BUT THERE IS A WARNING 
THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT STICKS TO 
ITS PAY CEILING TENSIONS WILL 
MOUNT 
THE STRIKES ARE SYMBOLIC MOUNT THEY ARE AIMED AT SHOWING THE 
GOVERNMENT DISCONTENT IF INFLATION 
TO RISE MORE STRONGLY THAN 
FORECAST THESE DEALS WOULD BE 
UNLIKELY TO HOLD AT AN INCREASE OF 
TWO POINT FIVE PER CENT 
BUT EVEN IF THE CHANCELLOR 
WANTED TO BE MORE GENEROUS HE 
WOULD BE STRUGGLING BECAUSE OF THE 
TIGHT SPENDING PLANS LAID DOWN BY 
HIS PREDECESSOR PRIVATE SECTOR PAY 
RISES ARE AVERAGING AT AROUND FOUR PER CENT 
AFTER A FEW YEARS RUNNING AHEAD OF 
THEY ARE NOW LAGGING BEHIND SHARP 
RISES IN EVERY DAY FOOD PRICES ARE 
RISING SO THE VOICES ARE SET TO GET 
EVEN LOUDER 
THERE IS TO BE A FORMAL 
INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER 
BRITAIN'S BIGGEST BANKS WRONGLY 
CHARGED CUSTOMERS HUNDREDS OF 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS FOR OVERDRAFT 
THE HIGH COURT SAID THE OFFICE OF 
FAIR TRADING CAN INVESTIGATE 
WHETHER BANKS WERE WRONG TO CHARGE 
CUSTOMERS WHO BECAME OVERDRAWN 
WITHOUT PRIOR AGREEMENT FROM THE 
BANKS THEMSELVES 
AN INVESTIGATION BY B. B. C. NEWS HAS 
FOUND THAT OPERATING THEATRES HAVE 
BEEN THROWN INTO CHAOS AND 
OPERATIONS ARE BEING CANCELLED 
BECAUSE SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS ARE 
BROKEN DIRTY OR MISSING THE ROYAL 
COLLEGE OF SURGEONS HAS TOLD US IT 
IS CONCERNED AND BLAMES THE POLICY 
OF CONTRACTING OUT THE WORK OF 
CLEANING THE INSTRUMENTS TO 
PRIVATELY RUN UNITS UNISON HAS 
RESPONDED TO NIGHT BY CALLING FOR 
THIS PRIVATISATION TO STOP 
THESE ARE THE SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS 
FOR JUST ONE OPERATION EVERY TRAY 
HAS TO BE IN PERFECT CONDITION IF 
ANYTHING IS MISSING BROKEN OR 
DIRTY IT IS USELESS TO THE SURGEON 
THESE PHOTOS SHOW WHAT SURGEONS ARE 
FINDING IN TRAYS MEANT TO BE CLEAN 
GIVEN TO THE B. B. C. BY THE SURGEONS 
ORGANISATION THEY ARE WORRIED THAT 
ORGANISATION THEY ARE WORRIED THAT CHANGES ARE THREATENING THE 
STANDARDS EACH YEAR MILLIONS OF 
TRAYS OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS ARE 
STERILISED IN THE PAST HOSPITALS 
HAD THEIR OWN DECONTAMINATION UNITS 
NOW SERVICES ARE BEING CENTRALISED 
WHERE THE PROCESS IS UNDER WAY 
PROBLEMS HAVE EMERGED 
THE EASE 
INSTRUMENTS ARE COMING IN IN 
COMPLETE KITS SO THAT AN OPERATION 
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GO AHEAD OR IF 
IT DOES GO AHEAD IT INVOLVES 
OPENING A BACK UP KIT IF THE BACK 
UP KIT HAS TO BE OPENED SOMEONE 
ELSE'S OPERATION IS CANCELLED 
HELEN HAD HER OPERATION CANCELLED 
TWICE THE HOSPITAL ADMIT IT 
DECONTAMINATION SERVICE WAS TO 
BLAME THE COMPANY CARRYING OUT THE 
WORK SAYS MISTAKES ARE RARE AND IT 
USES STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY 
BUT FOR HELEN IT WAS AN UPSETTING 
EXPERIENCE 
IT GETS HARDER EACH EXPERIENCE TIME I THINK FOR IT TO HAPPEN A 
SECOND TIME I WAS VERY UPSET AND 
VERY ANGRY IT IS NOT FAIR YOU PUT 
YOUR WHOLE LIFE ON HOLD FOR THESE 
THINGS AND THEN JUST TO BE TOLD TO 
GO AWAY 
ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEONS ARE 
PARTICULARLY FRUSTRATED AND SAY 
THERE IS A WEALTH OF ANECDOTAL 
EVIDENCE OF PROBLEMS GYNAECOLOGY GYNAECOLOGY INSTRUMENT HAVE APPEARED IN 
ORTHOPAEDIC TRAYS THERE HAVE BEEN 
INSTANCES OF TRAY WRAPS BEING 
DAMAGED THERE HAVE EVEN BEEN 
INSTANCES OF INSTRUMENTS SENT BACK 
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN STERILISED 
SURGEONS RELIED ON THE RIGHT 
EQUIPMENT FOR THEIR OPERATIONS THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS IT HAS INVESTED 
HEAVILY IN DECONTAMINATION SERVICES 
TWO HUNDRED MILLION HAS BEEN SPENT IN 
ENGLAND BUT TONIGHT THE HEALTH 
UNION UNISON HAS CALLED FOR A HALT 
TO DECONTAMINATION SUPER CENTRES 
UNTIL PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED 
COMING UP THE NORTH KOREANS STAND 
ACCUSED DID THEY HELP SYRIA BUILD 
A NUCLEAR REACTOR 
DETECTIVES IN WORCESTERSHIRE ARE 
QUESTIONING A MAN AND YOUTH IN

WAS FOUND IN UNDERGROWTH LESS THAN 
A MILE FROM HER HOME JAMES'S BODY 
WAS FOUND YESTERDAY AFTERNOON BUT 
WHEN HE WAS LAST SEEN ALIVE IS NOT 
KNOWN POLICE SOURCES HAVE TOLD ME 
THE CONDITION THE BODY WAS IN DOES 
NOT CLEARLY INDICATE HOW LONG HE 
HAD BEEN DEAD IT WAS HIS TWENTY SECOND 
BIRTHDAY ON MONDAY BUT JAMES WAS IN 
MANY WAYS STILL CHILD HE WAS 
SEVERELY AUTISTIC AND HAD EPILEPSY 
HIS MENTAL AGE WAS OF A TODDLER UP 
TO AGE EIGHTEEN HE ATTENDED THIS SCHOOL 
HE HAD A COMPLEX ANSWER BE A SET OF 
LEARNING NEEDS AND COULD NOT CARE 
FOR HIMSELF OR EXPRESS HIMSELF 
OTHER THAN BY SMILES LAUGHTER AND 
GESTURE HE LOVED INTERACTION AND 
WAS A VERY HAPPY PUPIL HEATHERS HEATHERS LONG TERM PARTNER BRIAN KIRKBY IS 
REPORTED TO BE ONE OF TWO PEOPLE 
CURRENTLY BEING QUESTIONED ABOUT 
THE MURDER OF JAMES POLICE ARE 
RENEWING THEIR APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC 
TO HELP THEM ESTABLISH THE 
MOVEMENTS OF BOTH HEATHER AND JAMES 
PRIOR TO THEIR DEATHS IN HOPE SOME 
LIGHT CAN BE SHED ON WHAT HAPPENED 
EARLIER THIS EVENING POLICE WERE 
GRANTED A FURTHER TWELVE HOURS TO 
CONTINUE THEIR QUESTIONING AND 
HERE AT THE SCENE FORENSIC TEAMS 
WILL RESUME THEIR SEARCH IN THE 
MORNING MORNING MOTORISTS IN SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN 
ENGLAND ARE BEING TOLD THEY WILL BE 
ENOUGH FUEL FOR 
THEIR CARS EVEN 
IF 
THE GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY IS CLOSED 
BY STRIKE ACTION THIS WEEKEND 
THERE IS CONCERN THE CLOSURE COULD 
CAUSE A KNOCK ON EFFECT BY CLOSING 
A MAJOR PIPELINE 
AND LIMITING 
SUPPLIES FROM THE NORTH SEA BUT 
JOHN HUTTON SAID IMPORTED SUPPLIES 
WOULD COVER ANY SHORTAGES 
THE HIGH COURT HAS RULED THAT 
ORDERS IMPOSED BY THE TREASURY TO 
FREEZE THE ASSETS OF TERROR SUSPECT 
WERE LEGALLY FLAWED BECAUSE THEY 
WERE TO PROVE BY PARLIAMENT THE 
TREASURY SAYS IT WILL APPEAL 
DAVID CAMERON THE CONSERVATIVE 
LEADER HAS WARNED OF A RISING TIDE 
OF CRIME IN BRITAIN HE MADE HIS 
CLAIM DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE 
LATEST OFFICIAL FIGURES SUGGEST 
OVERALL CRIME RATES ARE FALLING AS 
THE PARTY STEP UP THEIR CAMPAIGNING 
FOR NEXT WEEK'S LOCAL ELECTIONS 
ONE OPINION POLL TONIGHT GIVES THE 
CONSERVATIVES AN EIGHTEEN POINT LEAD OVER 
LABOUR MR. CAMERON WAS SPEAKING TO 
NICK ROBINSON IN THE SECOND OF OUR 
LEADERS INTERVIEWS 
IT WAS PERHAPS A CURIOUS DAY AND A 
CURIOUS PLACE FOR DAVID CAMERON TO 
TALK OF RISING TIDE OF CRIME ANY ANY WORRIES ANY SHOPLIFTING IS 
EVERYTHING PEACEFUL 
PEACEFUL AND 
QUIET SEEMS TO SUM UP FLEET IN 
HAMPSHIRE CRIME IS FALLING HERE 
AND TO SET OF STATISTICS PUBLISHED 
TODAY SUGGEST IT IS FALLING 
NATIONALLY AS WELL RECORDED CRIME 
FELL TWELVE PER CENT LAST YEAR AND THE BRITISH 
CRIME SURVEY IT AGREES SAYING IT 
HAS FALLEN BY SIX PER CENT GONE CRIME AND 
DRUG CRIME HAD INCREASED L. ASKED 
DAVID CAMERON WHY HE INSISTED ON 
SAYING CRIME IS RISING 
THE TWO 
MOST IMPORTANT FIGURES TODAY ARE 
THE FACT THAT GUN CRIME INCIDENTS 
ARE UP FOUR PER CENT AND DRUG CRIME IS UP TWENTY PER CENT 
CAN YOU BRING YOURSELF TO ADMIT PER CENT CRIME IS FALLING IN BRITAIN THE THE FIGURES TODAY SHOW SOME CRIME IS 
FALLING AND OTHER CRIME IS RISING 
BUT CRIME OVERALL IS FALLING FOR 
THE SECOND QUARTER ON BOTH MEASURES 
IF YOU WERE THE PRIME MINISTER YOU 
WOULD BE USING THESE FIGURES TO SAY 
CRIME IS FALLING 
THERE IS SOME 
WELCOME NEWS AND BAD NEWS LET'S 
ACT ON THE BAD BITS 
THE TORIES' 
LEADER LOCAL COMMANDER SAYS PEOPLE 
SHOULD BELIEVE THE START 
MY VIEW 
BASED ON TWENTY FIVE YEARS' WORTH OF 
POLICING EXPERIENCE IS YOU CAN 
PROVE A TRUE FACT AND THAT HIS 
CRIME IS FALLING LOCALLY 
POLITICIANS ARE WOULD DO WELL TO 
SAY SO YES 
WHERE I LIVE IS 
CONSIDERABLY SAFER IN TERMS OF 
VEHICLE CRIME THAN NOTTING HILL 
PROPER 
THE CONSERVATIVE PROPOSE PROPER TODAY 
AT THE MOMENT THERE IS AN TODAY ENORMOUS ANXIETY ABOUT CRIME SOME 
AREAS ALREADY SUFFER FROM THAT 
IMAGE MUCH BETTER IS TO PUBLISH 
THE INFORMATION IN A MAP WHAT 
CRIMES ARE TAKING PLACE WHERE AND 
WHEN AND GIVE PEOPLE THE 
INFORMATION AND ABILITY TO CALL 
POLICE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT AND 
WORK WITH THEM TO DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT IT 
AS GORDON BROWN'S 
ABOUT IT AS GORDON BROWN'S TROUBLES MOUNT DAVID CAMERON MUST 
KNOW THEY COME UNDER 
TODAY'S CRIME FIGURES SUGGEST NOT RISING 
TIDE OF 
CRIME AS HE SAID 
BUT A FALLING ONE 
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT 
INCLUDING SOME MEMBERS OF THE 
CABINET HAVE REVEALED THAT THEY 
EMPLOY RELATIVES WHOSE SALARY IS 
PAID BY THE TAXPAYER THE M. P.'S HAVE 
LISTED THEIR RELATIVES IN THE 
REGISTER OF MEMBERS' INTERESTS FOR 
THE FIRST TIME REETA CHAKRABARTI 
IS AT WESTMINSTER WHERE DO YOU 
THINK THIS LEAVES US 
WELL IT IS 
VERY INTERESTING ONE HUNDRED SIX M. P.'S HAVE 
DECLARED THAT THEY EMPLOY FAMILY 
MEMBERS ON THIS LIST THEY INCLUDE 
TWO CABINET MINISTERS HOME 
SECRETARY JACQUI SMITH AND THE 
ENVIRONMENT SECRETARY HILARY BENN 
THERE IS ALSO THE HOUSING MINISTER 
CAROLINE FLINT AND THE TORIES HOME 
AFFAIRS SPOKESMAN AND FORMER TORY 
LEADER MICHAEL HOWARD IN THAT LIST 
THERE ARE FIVE M. P.'S WHO EMPLOY MORE 
THAN ONE FAMILY MEMBER ALL OF 
THOSE WHO APPEAR ON THIS LIST HAVE 
DONE SO ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS THE 
SYSTEM DOES NOT BECOME COMPULSORY 
UNTIL AUGUST THE FIGURES SUGGEST 
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF 
M. P.'S WHO ARE STILL TO GO PUBLIC 
THAT IS BECAUSE DAVID CAMERON 
MENTIONED EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT 
OVER SEVENTY TORY M. P.'S EMPLOY FAMILY 
MEMBERS ONLY THIRTY NINE HAVE GONE PUBLIC 
TODAY ALONG WITH FIFTY FOUR LABOUR AND 
EIGHT LIBERAL DEMOCRATS L. MUST 
STRESS THAT THERE IS NO SUGGESTION 
THAT ANYBODY HAS DONE ANYTHING 
WRONG HERE BUT THE PUBLICATION OF 
THE LIST HAS RENEWED CALLS FOR THE 
PRACTICE OF EMPLOYING FAMILY 
MEMBERS TO BE BANNED M. P.'S ARE 
LOOKING INTO THIS CONDUCTING A 
REVIEW INTO WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN 
THE LONG TERM AND THAT IS DUE TO 
REPORT THIS SUMMER SO WE SHOULD 
GET MORE INFORMATION THEN AS TO HOW 
M. P.'S SEE THE FUTURE 
THE C. I. A. IS ABOUT TO RELEASE IMAGES 
FROM AN ALLEGED NUCLEAR FACILITY IN 
SYRIA WHICH WAS BOMBED BY ISRAEL 
LAST YEAR IT IS CLAIMED THE 
PICTURES WERE SHOWN NORTH KOREANS 
IN THE PLANT THE AMERICANS HAVE 
ACCUSED NORTH KOREA OF HELPING 
SYRIA TO BUILD THE REACTOR THE 
ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE BY THE C. I. A. IN 
A SECRET BRIEFING TO MEMBERS OF THE 
U. S. CONGRESS THEY CLAIMED THE 
REACTOR COULD HAVE BEEN UP AND 
RUNNING WITHIN WEEKS JUSTIN WEBB 
SENT THIS REPORT FROM WASHINGTON 
A MYSTERIOUS BEGINNING TO A 
MYSTERIOUS DAY IN WASHINGTON THE 
C. A. A. MOTORCADE ARRIVING AT CAPITOL 
HILL DEPOSITING STAFF THEIR 
INFORMATION DELIVERED IN SECRET 
THE C. I. A. DIRECTOR LEADING THE 
DELEGATION THIS IS THE SITE IN 
SYRIA THAT WAS BOMBED BY ISRAEL IN 
SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR THE ISRAELIS 
CLAIMED IT HAD BEEN A NUCLEAR 
REACTOR THE SYRIANS DENIED IT 
AFTER THE BOMBING THE SITE WAS 
FLATTENED BY THE SYRIANS IN 
PREPARATION FOR MORE BUILDING 
ISRAELI PLANES REGULARLY FLY ON 
EXERCISES ON THE SYRIAN BORDER THE 
ISRAELIS HAD NO DOUBT ABOUT THE 
NEED TO SEND THEM ON A REAL MISSION 
LAST YEAR BUT THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION HAS REMAINED SILENT 
ON THE ISSUE UNTIL NOW PERHAPS 
WANTING TO PROTECT THE FRAGILE SIX 
NATION TALKS IN WHICH AMERICA IS 
TRYING TO EXERT DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE 
TO END NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR WORK I I REALLY BELIEVE ON AN ISSUE THAT IS 
THIS CRITICAL TO THE ISSUE OF 
PROLIFERATION TO THE SITUATION IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST TO WHAT IS GOING 
ON IN THE SIX PARTY TALKS AND THESE 
TYPES OF THINGS CONGRESS NEEDED 
THIS INFORMATION TO BE A FULL 
PARTNER IN THOSE EFFORTS 
SO WHY 
DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR THE WHITE 
HOUSE TO DECIDE TO GIVE THIS 
BRIEFING AND WHY NOW THE 
DEMOCRATS ARE SUSPICIOUS 
IN TERMS 
OF THE ACTION TAKEN BY THE 
ADMINISTRATION I FIND THE TIME 
INCURIOUS AND I WILL ASK ABOUT IT 
FIRST THE C. A. A. WILL MAKE ITS CASE 
TO THE WIDER WORLD IF THE ISRAELIS 
SPY PHOTOS ALLEGEDLY SHOW NORTH 
KOREANS IN THE FACILITY BEFORE IT 
WAS BOMBED THE SYRIAN AMBASSADOR 
TO THE UN SAYS THE SO CALLED 
EVIDENCE IS NONSENSE 
THERE WAS NO 
SYRIAN NORTH KOREAN CO OPERATION 
WHATSOEVER IN SYRIA AND WE DENIED 
THESE RUMOURS 
WITH THE PRESIDENT'S 
SENIOR ADVISERS LEADING CAPITOL 
HILL A SHORT TIME AGO IT LOOKS AS 
IF A MAJOR DIPLOMATIC SHOWDOWN WITH 
SYRIA AND NORTH KOREA IS ON THE 
CARDS PERHAPS THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO GIVE THE 
NORTH KOREANS A NUDGE TO LET THEM 
KNOW AMERICA WAS STILL VIGILANT AND 
CONCERNED ABOUT PAST PROLIFERATION 
PERHAPS SOMEONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
WANTED TO SCUPPER THE NORTH KOREA 
TALKS OR PERHAPS THE IMPETUS CAME 
FROM HAWKS IN CONGRESS THE REAL 
MOTIVE IS NOT CLEAR 
FOOTBALL NEWS IT HAS BEEN ANOTHER 
IMPORTANT NIGHT FOR BRITISH TEAMS 
IN EUROPE RANGERS HAVE BEEN IN 
ACTION AT IBROX AGAINST FIORENTINA 
IN THE SEMI FINALS OF THE UEFA CUP 
ADRIAN MUTU FOR THE ITALIANS HAD 
THE BEST CHANCE OF THE NIGHT BUT 
WAS UNABLE TO FINISH AND THE GAME 
DRAGGED ON TO A GOALLESS DRAW 
RANGERS' HOPES OF MEAT REACHING 
THE FINAL REMAIN VERY MUCH ALIVE 
AND THE TEAMS WILL NOW MEET IN THE 
SECOND LEG IN FLORENCE IN THE FIRST 
WEEK OF MAY 
THERE IS MORE NEWS OVER ON THE B. B. C.

YOU ARE
