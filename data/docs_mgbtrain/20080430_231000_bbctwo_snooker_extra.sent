HELLO AGAIN IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT 
PRODUCING THE BEST FORM THE MORNING 
AFTER THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT ALI CARTER TRY TO DO 
THIS MORNING WHEN HE CAME OUT TO 
FINISH HIS MATCH AGAINST PETER 
EBDON THE NIGHT BEFORE HE HAD 
KNOCKED IN HIS FIRST EVER MAXIMUM 
BREAK OVERNIGHT HE HAD TO TRY TO 
GET A FEW FORTY WINKS SLEEP KNOWING HE 
HELD AND NINE TO SEVEN ADVANTAGE IN THE 
COMMENTARY BOX NEAL FOULDS AND 
TERRY GRIFFITHS 
SO THE MAXIMUM MAN BREAKS OFF ALI 
CARTER THE FINAL SESSION OF THIS 
MATCH WE WILL FIND A WINNER AT 
SOME POINT DURING THE MORNING OR 
BILLY AFTERNOON EARLIER 
AFTERNOON NINE TO SEVEN AHEAD A BRILLIANT 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN WHICH HE CERTAINLY ENJOYED AS 
DID EVERYBODY ELSE WHO SOLID WHO 
SAW IT 
I SUPPOSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD 
THINK THAT CARTER IS GOING TO GO 
THROUGH WITH THE MOMENTUM FROM LAST 
NIGHT BUT THE MANNER THE TABLE NOW 
PROBABLY STILL FANCIES THE JOB 
THE MAN AT THE TABLE 
HE IS THE WARRIOR IF HE WERE TO 
PUT SOMEBODY OUT THERE TO FIGHT FOR 
YOUR LIFE YOU WOULD PICK THIS MAN THAT WAS SOME SHOT 
THE CUE BALL IS RIGHT BEHIND THE 
BLACK GREAT SHOT 
I DO NOT KNOW IF HE HIT THAT BADLY 
OR HE GOT A KICK A BIT OF BOTH 
THAT IS NOT TO SAY HE WILL NOT TAKE 
THIS RED ON INTO THE SAME POCKET IN 
WHICH HE POTTED THE OTHER ONE 
NOT QUITE SO SUCCESSFUL THIS TIME 
AROUND 
ANOTHER EXCELLENT POT IN MY 
OPINION HE DESERVES IT IT IS RIGHT 
UNDER THE CUSHION PETER EBDON 
OUT HERE AND 
PETER EBDON HAS COME OUT HERE AND AS USUAL HE HAS PUT IN A BIT OF A 
SPURT EARLIER ON EARLIER ON 
HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY WELL TO 
COME FROM NINE TO SEVEN BEHIND ESPECIALLY IF 
CARTER RETAINS HIS FORM 
ALI WILL 
BE PLEASED THAT PETER EBDON'S SHOT 
ON THE BROWN RUN SLIGHTLY WRONG HE 
DID NOT GET FAR ENOUGH DOWN THE 
TABLE 
HE HAS TRIED TO GIVE NOTICE THAT HE 
IS DIGGING IN THIS MORNING BUT HE 
HAS HAD TWO CHANCES HE HAS CREATED 
WITH OPENING RED THAT HAVE NOT 
REALLY AMOUNTED TO ANYTHING 
THAT IS A SAFETY SHOT FROM PETER 
EBDON HE IT CERTAINLY OPENED THE 
BALLS OUT 
I AM NOT SURE HE CAN GET TO THE 
POTTING ANGLE IF HE CAN HE WILL 
TAKE IT ON BECAUSE HE CAN'T POTTED 
IN THE TOP CORNER AND TRY TO 
SPOTTED BLACK TRY TO SPOT IT BACK 
FOR THE BLACK 
NOT A BAD ATTEMPT BUT HE CALLED IT 
A BIT ON THE THICK SIDE BIKEY 
COAL TIT HE CAUGHT IT 
HE COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE THE RED 
COULD HAVE GONE ACROSS THE POCKET 
I DO NOT THINK ALI WILL BE 
INTERESTED IN THIS IT COULD HAVE 
BEEN CLOSER TO THE POCKET PLAYING 
LITTLE SAFE OFF OF PLAYING A 
LITTLE SAFE OF THE CLUSTER OF FIVE 
REDS THE PRIORITY IS ALWAYS TO GET 
THE CUE BALL BEHIND THE BACK 
CUSHION THAT WAS QUITE A BAD 
MISTAKE IT IS GOING TO TAKE ONE 
GOOD OPENING SHOT FROM PETER EBDON 
AND THIS IS A BETTER CHANCE THAN 
THE FIRST TWO 
HE HAD TO PLAY THAT VERY GENTLY TO 
GET THE SPIN ON IT TO PAY TO GET 
THE SPIN TO PLAY THE REDS THE PINK 
IS AVAILABLE INTO THE RIGHT CORNER 
AND INTO ONE OF THE CENTRE POCKET 
CENTRE POCKETS 
THOSE FOUR REDS BY THE PINK ARE ALL 
AVAILABLE 
THAT DID NOT SEEM LIKE A GREAT 
CONTACT A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION 
THE FINAL SESSION 
ALI CARTER PLAYED THAT SAFETY OFF 
THE BACK OF THE PACK AND HE SEEMED 
TO HAVE ENOUGH BACKSPIN BUT IT 
DOES NOT MATTER NOW EBDON IS IN 
AMONGST THEM A VERY STRANGE SET OF REDS UP THAT 
THERE ARE THREE 
SIDE OF THE TABLE THERE ARE THREE OF THEM 
IF YOU CAN GET UP FIFTY 
LEIGH DEAKIN NOT REALLY MIND IF 
YOU CAN GET A FIFTY POINT LEAD IT 
DOES NOT REALLY MATTER SUPERB POSITIONAL SHOT 
HE MAY BE ABLE TO PLAY ON THE RED 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GREEN 
HE IS CLOSING OUT THE FRAME THERE 
IS STILL MORE WORK TO DO 
EVERYTHING IS AWKWARD 
HE HAD TO PLAY THE BROWN DEAD 
WEIGHT TO RETAIN HIS POSITION ON 
THE RED THIS IS VERY GOOD FROM 
PETER EBDON 
THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY GOOD BREAK 
OF FIFTY ONE WHERE THE BALLS WAR GIVEN 
WHERE THE BALLS WERE PLACED IT IS 
VERY GOOD 
HE LOOKS LIKE A PLAYER WHO IS 
DETERMINED 
AT TYPICAL EBDON EFFORT TYPICAL 
ADD AN EFFORT EBDON 
HE HAS THE KIND OF CONCENTRATION OF 
THE PLAYERS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE 
OTHER 
THE FRAME IS NOW SAFE BARRING A 
NUMBER OF SNOOKERS 
ALI CARTER A CONCEIT PETER EBDON 
WITH THE FIRST FRAME OF THE DAY 
ALI CARTER CONCEDES THE FRAME 
PETER CAN JUST ABOUT GET TO THE 
EDGE OF A RED 
A PRETTY GOOD SHOT A TYPICAL PETER EBDON SHOT UNPREDICTABLE 
I ONLY SEE PROFESSIONALS TAKE THAT 
SHOT IF IT IS A LAST RESORT PETER 
PLAYS IT A LOT AND PLAYS IT WELL 
IT IS ONE OF THE SHOTS IN HIS 
ARMOURY 
THERE IS A LOT OF NOISE THE OTHER 
TABLE HIS FINISHING THEIR SESSION 
THE OTHER TABLE THIS FINISHING 
THEIR SESSION HE'S FINISHING 
HE'S FINISHING 
HIS LONG POTTING HAS NOT BEEN GREAT 
THIRTY THREE PER CENT AT THE MOMENT ALL THE MORE 
CREDIT TO HIM HE HIT THAT PERFECT 
BUT SLIGHTLY MISSED JUDGE THE 
CANNON MISJUDGED THINGS HAVE 
NOT GONE FOR PETER EBDON SULPHUR 
I WAS JUST THAT IS IN IT SO FAR 
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY THAT THE 
KISS USE OF HAS LEFT THE CUE BALL 
ON THE SIDE CUSHION HE CANNOT 
REALLY TAKE ON THE PINK THE KISS 
HE HAD HAS LEFT THE CUE BALL ON THE 
SIDE CUSHION 
WE SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT HOW PETER 
EBDON TAKES ON A HIGHER RISK SHOT 
BUT THERE IS A FINE LINE YOU'RE 
NOT GOING TO SAY HE IS NOT GOING TO 
TAKE THE PINK ON DEAD WEIGHT 
BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN HIM DO IT 
PLAYED GOOD SAFETY AND PUT THE 
PRESSURE BACK ON CARTER HE IS IN 
TROUBLE HERE HE IS TAPPING THE 
TABLE AN APPRECIATION OF THE 
QUALITY OF THE SAFETY SHOT FROM 
PETER EBDON 
THAT DOUBLE KISS IS ALWAYS ON AND 
SOMETIMES IT HE'S UNAVOIDABLE IT 
LOOKED ON FROM THE START NOT JUST 
BECAUSE IT HAPPENED YOU TRY AND 
KID YOURSELF THAT YOU CAN AVOID THE 
DOUBLE KISS 
YES BUT LOOK WHAT HE 
HAS LEFT PETER EBDON THAT IS A 
VERY VERY GOOD SHOT UNDER THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES AND ONCE AGAIN HE 
HAS NOT COME RIGHT ON A COLOUR 
BECAUSE OF THE AWKWARD BRIDGING HE 
JUDGED HE JUST NUDGED THE BLACK 
OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
PERFECT ON THE PINK TO THE MIDDLE 
WHAT DOES PETER DO HERE AS HE 
TRIED TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN 
DOES HE TRY TO TAKE ON 
THE PINK 
TO 
GET THINGS HAPPENING FOR HIM HE 
HAS GOT TO PLAY AN ATTACKING SHOT 
HE IS PLAYING THE BLACK A THIN CUT 
ON THE BLACK IT WOULD COVER OF 
THAT POCKET IF HE MISSED IT IT IS 
DIFFICULT AND WE SEE THE 
UNPREDICTABILITY THERE OF THE PETER 
EBDON SHOT SELECTION 
IT WAS A GREAT SHOT BUT WITH THE 
CUE BALL RUNNING I JUST WONDER HOW 
FAR IT HAS GONE AND WHAT SORT OF 
RED HE IS ON 
HE CAN GET TO ONE HE IS DESPERATELY STRIVING FOR A GOOD POSITION TO BE IN 
ALL CREDIT BECAUSE WHEN HE CAME TO 
THE TABLE IT DID NOT LOOK LIKE HE 
HAD BEEN ALL THAT FORTUNATE BUT HE 
HAS GOT THINGS HAPPENING OBVIOUSLY 
THE BLACK IS OUT OF COMMISSION FOR 
A MINUTE HE CAN SCORED QUITE 
HEAVILY FOR THE OTHER REDS AND PINK 
WITH 
THE OTHER REDS AND THE 
PINK 
PETER EBDON WAS FULLY AWARE THAT HE 
WAS SWIMMING AGAINST THE INCOMING 
TIDE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE JUST GOT 
TO TAKE THE BULL BY THE HORNS HE 
TOOK ON A VERY DIFFICULT THING 
BLACK GOT IT AND NOW HE IS IN 
PERFECT POSITION IT IS EASY TO SAY 
AFTERWARDS BUT IT TOOK SOME COURAGE 
TO TAKE THAT BLACK ON 
HE IS FIFTEEN AHEAD WITH FOUR REDS LEFT 
IF HE CAN TAKE THE THREE WAVES THAT 
ARE OPEN REDS WITH PINKS HE 
WILL BE THIRTY SIX POINTS IN FRONT BY THE 
TIME HE GETS TO LAST RED THE ONE 
THAT IS BY THE BLACK HE CAN WIN 
THE FRAME JUST 
I THINK HE PLAYED THE CANNON I 
DON'T THINK HE NEEDED TO BUT HE IS 
ONCE AGAIN ON AT THE PINK 
WHAT IS HE DOING HE HAS PLAYED TO 
CANNON THAT RED AWAY FROM THE BLACK 
AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE WITH 
JUST PINKS 
I'D DO NOT THINK HE HAD 
A GOOD LOOK AT THE SCORES THERE 
WAS NO NEED TO BRING THAT RED INTO 
PLAY THAT IS QUITE A BAD MISTAKE 
FOR SOMEONE OF PETER EBDON'S 
EXPERIENCE IF HE HAD NOT PLAYED 
FOR THE CANNON HE WOULD 
NEVER HAVE 
MISSED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE 
THAT WAS A BETTER SHOT THAN IT 
LOOKED 
WELL WELL WELL HE WAS SO 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE POT HE DIDN'T 
THINK ABOUT THE POSITIONAL SIDE 
THERE ARE CHANCES ONCE AGAIN IN 
THIS FRAME FOR BOTH PLAYERS IT CAN 
ONLY AFFECT YOU BADLY IF YOU LOSE 
THE FRAME IT IS HUGE FRAME FOR 
BOTH PLAYERS WITH REGARD TO WHAT 
HAS HAPPENED PETER EBDON HAS HAD 
CHANCES TO WIN IT VERY GOOD 
CHANCES WE THINK HE MISSED COUNTED 
THE SCORE MISCOUNTED 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE I 
THOUGHT THE RED WAS GOING TO HANG 
OVER THE POCKET 
HE WAS LUCKY WHEN HIS LAST SAFETY 
SHOT AND HE HAS BEEN FORTUNATE 
AGAIN 
THIS HASN'T BEEN A GOOD STANDARD OF 
PLAY FROM EITHER PLAYER WHICH YOU 
HAVE EXPECT IN THE FINAL SESSION 
AFTER SUCH WONDERFUL SESSION LAST NIGHT 
IT IS HARD TO CALL WHAT A SHOT HE 
PLAYED THERE 
IF IT WASN'T FOR THE PINK IT WOULD 
BE A GREAT CHANCE FOR ALI CARTER 
BUT NOW HE IS SNOOKERED 
HE CANNOT GET ROUND THAT PINK HE 
COULD PLAY LITTLE SWERVE 
WON'T GO DOWN AS THE SHOT OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
HE HIT THE RED ABOVE THE RIGHT 
CENTRE AND HE PLAYED IT WITH PACE 
BECAUSE HE 
HAD A 
STRAIGHT 
HIT OFF 
THE CUSHION HE DIDN'T 
GET IT 
HIT 
THE OTHER ONE AND IT HAS GONE SAFE 
IT HAS BEEN ALL CAR PARK HAVING THE 
RUNNING IN THIS FINAL SESSION 
CARTER 
I DON'T LIKE TO SEE IT BUT HE 
BUTCHERED THAT ONE THIS IS MENTAL 
TORTURE FOR BOTH PLAYERS 
IT IS 
BECOMING A MASSIVE FRAME IN THIS 
MATCH L. KNOW WE SAY THAT A LOT IF 
CARTER CAN GO ELEVEN EIGHT BEEN 
FORTUNATE I'M NOT SURE WHAT PETER 
WOULD HAVE LEFT 
IT IS NOT UNUSUAL NOTHING WOULD 
SURPRISE HAS BEEN THE CRUCIBLE 
AFTER THE SESSION IN THESE TWO 
PLAYERS PUT TOGETHER LAST NIGHT 
PETER EBDON WITH TWO CENTURIES AND 
THE CHANCE OF A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN AND ALI CARTER 
WITH HIS MAXIMUM AND THIS MORNING 
LET'S JUST SAY IT HASN'T BEEN QUITE 
UP TO THAT STANDARD 
THIS IS A BETTER SHOT I THINK 
PETER CAN GET TO A RED IT HAS NOT 
BEEN 
THE SAME AS 
LAST NIGHT BECAUSE 
THIS 
IS THE 
VITAL SESSION THIS IS 
WHERE YOU 
FIND YOUR 
WINNER AND 
LOSER IN THIS MATCH LAST NIGHT WE 
HAD A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE IT IS OBVIOUSLY 
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT TODAY 
THIS IS AWFUL YOU EXPECT THE LEVEL 
TO DROP BUT BOTH PLAYERS WOULD BE 
DISAPPOINTED WITH HOW THEY HAVE 
PLAYED 
HAS PETER LEFT A GAP IT WOULD BE 
TYPICAL OF THE MORNING SESSION IF 
THAT IS THE CASE THAT IS THE 
DIFFERENCE PETER HAS PLAYED NOT A 
GOOD 
SHOT AND 
IS LOOKING 
FOR A 
BETTER OF 
COVER AND 
HE HAS NOT GOT 
IT THIS IS A GOLDEN CHANCE FOR ALI 
CARTER PETER IS EMOTIONLESS HE 
MUST BE 
THINKING ABOUT 
THE NUMBER 
OF SHOTS 
THAT HAVE 
GONE AGAINST HIM 
IN THIS FRAME 
AS OFTEN HAPPENS IF YOU PLAY FOR 
BLUE OR PINK YOU LAND IN BETWEEN 
THEM THE BROWN IS AN OPTION 
WHATEVER HE HAS GOT TO FULLY 
COMMIT AND MAKE HIS DECISION 
HE HAS TO POT THE COLOUR AND MAKE 
SURE HE IS ON THIS LAST RED THAT WAS WELL PLAYED A BETTER SHOT 
NORMALLY YOU WOULD SAY THIS WOULD 
BE EASY BUT A VERY SHORT IN THIS 
FRAME HAS BEEN A BIG EFFORT EVERY 
SHOT 
HE IS UP TO THE BLUE HE IS HAVING WILL LOOK JUST BROWN 
AND BLUE HEATED FOR PETER TO 
REQUIRE SNOOKERS NEEDED L. DO NOT THINK HE WILL 
BE TOO 
WORRIED ABOUT 
GETTING ON THE PINK 
AT TELLING CLEARANCE FOR ALI CARTER 
TO EXTEND HIS LEAD OVER PETER EBDON 
JUST A SAFETY OFF PETER EBDON'S 
BREAK AVAILABLE 
CARTER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE 
MATCH HAS BEEN THREE FRAMES UP 
WHAT CAN THE WARRIOR COME UP WITH 
NOT A LOT 
MISSED TIME AND THAT ONE 
MISTIMED THAT ONE WE ARE USED TO 
SEEING PETER EBDON COME UP WITH 
SOMETHING WHEN HE IS FACING 
ADVERSITY THAT IS THE FIRST TIME I 
HAVE 
SEEN HIM 
LOOKING DISAPPOINTED 
IN THIS MATCH 
LEE HAVE YET TO SEE IF THE PREVIOUS 
FRAME WHICH ALI CARTER MANAGED TO 
WIN HAS GIVEN THEM A BIT OF 
CONFIDENCE 
HE WAS VERY FORTUNATE HE TOTALLY 
MISHIT THAT ONE HE PLAYED FOR THE 
GAP AND THE REDS HAVE COME BACK 
OUT 
TO CONTROL THE CUE BALL HERE OUT HE 
HAS GOT 
TO BE A BIT CAREFUL 
I DON'T THINK HE CAN HOLD IT FOR 
THE BLACK L. WONDER IF HE IS 
THINKING ABOUT PLAYING IT INTO THE 
PACK THAT WAS QUITE WELL THOUGHT 
OUT HE KNEW HE WAS GOING INTO THE 
REDS IN SOME FORM 
WE SAW A LITTLE GRIMMEST THERE I 
DO NOT THINK HE HAS CAUGHT THE BEST 
OF ANGLES ON THIS BLACK HE CAN 
SWING IT AROUND OFF TWO CUSHIONS ON 
THIS NEXT RED O'DEA OH I 
AM SURPRISED HE MISSED IT ON THE 
THICK SIDE OF THE POCKET 
HE MISSED THE BLACK TO THE BOTTOM 
JAW 
PETER HAS SOME I LEFT THAT RED ON 
SOMEHOW THERE HAS COME TWENTY FIVE AND IS GONE OF THE POCKET IF MARK OVER 
A GOOD POT HE DID EXCEPTIONALLY 
WELL TO GET OUT THERE 
HE WAS A 
LITTLE FORTUNATE TO GET THERE FOR 
THE FIRST TIME I HAVE JUST SEEN 
STEPHEN SHAKING HIS HEAD PETER 
THE PINK FOR THE FIRST TIME IT IS 
STARTING TO GET TO HIM I THINK 
HE SHOWED THAT WHEN HE MISSED THE 
FIRST WRONG RED IN THIS FRAME L. DO 
NOT CARE WHERE THAT DO NOT CARE 
HOW STRONG NEWARK BUT WHEN YOU GET 
OUT THERE AND MISSED CHANCES AND 
PUT BE BAD RUN IN HE HAS HAD AT 
TIMES IT IS GOING TO HAVE AN 
EFFECT HOW STRONG YOU ARE I'M I'M SITTING HERE AS A COMPLETE NEUTRAL 
IN HIS MARCH BUT IT IS SAD HOW 
THINGS HAVE GONE FOR HIM THIS 
MORNING IN THIS MATCH IT WAS 
NURSING TO BE QUITE ABLE TO TAKE 
THIS CHANCE THE LAST FRAME HE WON 
WAS A SCRAPPY AFFAIR HE DOES NOT 
SEEM TO BE ABLE THINGS ARE 
STARTING TO GET TO MR. EBDON 
IT IS TOUGH OUT THERE SOMETIMES 
YOU HANG IN THERE AND HOPE 
EVERYTHING GOES FOR YOU OTHERWISE 
YOU STRUGGLE AND THAT IT WOULD 
HAVE HAPPENED THE THAT IS WHAT IS 
HAPPENING TO PETER EBDON 
HE HAS LOOKED AT A PLANT IN THAT 
PACK THERE ARE TWO REDS AT THE 
BOTTOM THINK HE IS JUST SKIMMING 
OFF THE EDGE OF THESE TALKING 
ABOUT EBDON BUT CARTER CANNOT FEEL 
TOO GREAT OUT THERE HE HAS MISSED 
THAT FEW CHANCES IN THIS FRAME WE 
THOUGHT HE WOULD KICK ON AFTER 
WINNING THE PREVIOUS FRAME BUT HE 
HAS MARK HE HASN'T 
A GOOD SHOT MAN AND ALI WITH HIS 
LEAD OF THIRTEEN COULD DO WITH 
CONVERTING THIS A GOOD SHOT NOW 
PETER IT LOOKS A LITTLE RATTLED IN 
HIS CHAIR 
THE RED THAT'S COVERING THE PINK IS 
POSSIBLE FOR ALI POT A BALL 
POSSIBLE THIS IS TURNING INTO A 
GOOD CHANCE 
HE DECIDED TO PLAY ON THE PINK NOT 
TOO BAD 
HE IS FINDING IT HARD TO WIN THIS 
FRAME L. THINK THE RED HE PLAYED HAS BEEN COVERED 
THAT IS TIGHT THESE TABLES DO NOT 
HAVE A LOT OF KNACK THERE IS A 
CHANCE CHILDREN A FRACTION THERE 
IS A CHANCE THAT COULD SLOW DOWN A 
FRACTION L. DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE CAN LEAVE TO BE ON THE BLACK 
THEY HAVE SEEN A LOT HAPPIER PETER 
I HAVE SEEN HIM LOOK AT THERE 
HAPPIER 
TWENTY FIVE MINUTES SINCE HE POTTED A BALL 
AND CARTER HAS MADE QUITE A FEW 
MISTAKES LIKE LEAVING ANYTHING 
WITHOUT LEAVING ANYTHING 
HE COULD JUST ABOUT GET THROUGH THE 
POTTING ANGLE THERE AND EVEN THEN 
HE HAD TO BRIDGE OVER A RED HE HAD 
TO STRIKE DOWN TO GET THE NECESSARY 
SPEND GET BACK FOR THE BLUE HE HAS 
PLAYED IT 
FULL IT WILL TAKE A MASSIVE EFFORT 
FROM PETER EBDON TO CLEAR FROM HERE 
TO WAIT AND SO THE WAY THINGS 
HAVE GONE IT WILL TAKE HE CAN 
TURN A FRAME AROUND AT TIMES WHEN 
YOU DO NOT EXPECT 
HE HE THAT WAS WELL PLAYED HE GOT 
THE PACE JUST RIGHT THERE THAT 
WAS WELL PLAYED 
JUST ONE POINT IN IT TWO NOW 
THERE IS BIT DIFFERENT THERE THREE HUNDRED FIVE 
TO THREE HUNDRED SIX AT AS LEVEL THINGS UP SOME 
OF THESE STEPS STATISTICS ARE 
AMAZING AMAZING THE AIR ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SCORE 
IS ELEVEN TO EIGHT THEY ARE 
SOMETHING HE DOES IT VERY WELL THE 
ONLY DIFFICULT SHOT HERE IS THE 
BLACK TO GET ON THE RED DECENT 
SHOT 
LEFT A NICE ANGLE ON THE PINK TO 
GET DOWN TO THE YELLOW HE HAS DONE 
VERY WELL HERE L. WOULD NOT HAVE 
GIVEN HIM ANY HOPE WELL WELL 
WELL 
YOU WOULD HAVE PUT YOUR HOUSE ON 
HIM CLEARING UP FROM HERE YOU CAN 
SEE SOME MOVEMENT THERE 
I WAS JUST SAYING HOW WELL HE HAS 
DONE HE LOOKED VERY LOLL MENTALLY 
LOW YOU WOULD THINK THE PINK 
WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH 
YES IT DID NOT LOOK LIKE AN EBDON 
MISS COMING IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HE 
WAS GETTING INTO THIS AFTER WHAT 
HAS BEEN A TOUGH WARNING FOR HIM SO 
FAR A CHANCE FOR ALI CARTER A 
REALLY GOOD CHANCE AS WELL JUST 
HAVING A QUICK GLANCE AT THE SCORES 
THAT TWO POINT LEAGUE HE HAS GOT 
MEANS MORE THAN WHAT DO YOU THINK 
LEAD IT MEANS HE CAN ONLY POT UP 
TO THE BLUE TO BE THE FRAME TO 
WIN THE FRAME BARRING SNOOKERS 
THAT IS THE KIND OF SHOT YOU CAN 
OVER HEAD OR ON THE HEAD ON THE 
SCREW SHOT BUT IT IS ACTUALLY 
CRUCIAL HE ONLY NEEDS TO THE BLUE 
KNOCKED THE PINK YOU CAN FEEL THE 
TENSION OUT THERE NOW 
HE ONLY NEEDS THE BLUE HE LOOKED 
FOR ONE MINUTE AND AS THOUGH HE HAD 
PLAYED A BAD SHOT AND HE COULD NOT 
GET ON THE PINK HOW OFTEN CAN THAT 
HAPPEN WHEN PLAYERS ARE UNDER 
PRESSURE 
HE SHOULD HAVE NONE THE SCORES 
KNOWN 
DON'T HIT THE LEFT KNUCKLE DON'T 
HIT THE RIGHT KNUCKLE TOUR FRED 
THIS ONE TOUGH RED THIS ONE 
BEAUTIFUL 
I THINK THIS MAY HAVE GIVEN HIM THE 
ANGLE TO GO ONE CUSHION INTO THE 
PACK OR IF HE IS STRAIGHTER 
COULD ERECT IT DEPENDS ON THE 
ANGLE HE HAS GOT GO DIRECT 
HE GOT SOMEWHAT ON THAT IT WAS 
OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE STRAIGHTER THAN 
EVEN ALI THOUGHT 
THAT WILL BE END OF BREAK JUST A 
BIT STRAIGHT TERRI WASN'T IT 
I THINK YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT AHEAD 
OF HIMSELF THERE I THINK HE GOT 
A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF HIMSELF THERE 
THAT IS A ONCE A YEAR SHOT HE HAS 
GOT POWER BODY CANNOT PARK THE BALL 
BUT HE CANNOT ARC THE BALL THE 
CHANCE IS GONE 
HE IS THIRTY A N. T. S. IN FRONT AND 
PETER EBDON IS FACED WITH NOTHING 
TO GO FOR THIRTY EIGHT 
HE IS MAYBE PLAYING TO SHOW THIS 
RED TO THE RIGHT OF THE BLACK AT 
CONTAINING SHOT HE HAS MADE A MESS 
OF IT AND HE HAS LEFT THE RED ON 
AND IT LOOKS AS THOUGH PETER EBDON 
BIT OF ANGLE HERE TO 
GET OUT FOR THE BLACK 
GREAT SHOT BUT AWKWARD CUEING HE 
IS RESTRICTED IN THE SHOT HE CAN 
PLAY NEXT HE HAD TO PLAY THAT RED 
WITH BIT OF POWER JUST TO GET OUT FOR THE BLACK 
HE MAY BE ABLE TO CUE BETWEEN THE 
TWO REDS THAT WOULD HELP HIM HOW 
HIGH WAS THAT BRIDGE HE IS COMING 
DOWN FROM THE HEAVENS 
LOOKS QUITE PAINFUL HE HAS TO KEEP 
A FOOT ON THE GROUND IT IS NOT SO 
MUCH PLAYING THE SHOT IT IS MAYBE 
GETTING UP THE TABLE AFTERWARDS HE 
WILL BE STUCK THERE FOREVER HE IS 
COMING OUT WITH THE SWAN NECK 
WHICH YOU DO IT SEE THAT OFTEN 
YOU DON'T SEE THAT OFTEN IT IS 
USED TO BUY FOUR OR FIVE TIMES 
EVERY JABEEN TIP AS BAD ABOUT 
ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE TIMES EVERY 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
VERY WELL PLAYED AS GOOD AS YOU 
COULD HAVE DONE HE HAS GIVEN 
HIMSELF A CHANCE OF A RED INTO THE 
LEFT CENTRE 
HE WOULD HAVE LEFT THAT RED ON 
BECAUSE THE WHITE DIDN'T THE BLUE 
IS COVERING IT 
NOT QUITE A GOOD POSITIONAL SHOT 
HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF AN ANGLE TO POT 
THIS RED IT WILL TAKE THE CUE BALL 
DOWN TOWARDS THE BLACK HE WOULD 
LIKE AN EASIER POT HE NEEDS TO TRY 
TO DISLODGE THIS PACK OF REDS 
THERE ARE TWO REDS AT THE BACK OF 
THE PACK THERE WAS HAVE A CHANCE 
OF HIM MAKING PLANT IF HE CANNOT 
GET UP TO THE RIGHT THERE WAS 
HAVE CHANCE OF HIM MAKING A PLANT 
IF HE CAN GET UP TO THE RED HAD 
GET TO THE RED 
HE HAS GOT ONE ON 
A TRICKY ONE L. THINK HE TRIED TO 
AVOID THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE 
PACK THEY HAVE NOT PLAYED VERY 
WELL THERE FOUR REDS STILL VERY 
CLOSE TOGETHER THIS ONE CAN BE 
MISSED BUT THERE ARE FOUR REDS 
TOGETHER I LIKE THE WAY HE PLAYED IT 
IT SHOWS HE IS STILL CUEING WELL 
ENOUGH TO MAKE SOME SORT OF A 
COMEBACK A GREAT SHOT 
HE WAS AND HE WAS GOING TO GET THE 
SHOT IT IS A DIFFERENT PETER EBDON 
THAT WE SAW IN THE FIRST FOUR 
FRAMES OF THIS SESSION 
I WONDER IF 
HE CAN GET TO ANY OF THOSE REDS IN 
THE GROUP OF FOUR 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE STRAIGHT BUT 
HE IS ABSOLUTELY DEAD STRAIGHT HE 
PUT THE WRONG SIDE ON THAT A 
LITTLE BIT OF RIGHT HAND SIDE IT 
STOPPED THE CUE BALL GOING 
NATURALLY UP INTO THE PACK HE DID 
NOT QUITE HIT THIS PROPERLY BUT HE 
IS BACK IN THE FRAME 
CARTER CAN JUST ABOUT SEE A TOUCH 
OF THE RED BEHIND THE PINK 
PLAYED THAT VERY WELL HE DID NOT 
REALLY WANT THE KISS ON THE BROWN 
THOUGH THAT HAS LEFT PETER EBDON 
TO CHANCE OF A LONG RED THE 
CHANCE I THINK HE HAS BEEN FORTUNATE THERE 
THEY ARE PULLED UP THE CURTAIN 
BETWEEN THE TWO TABLES THE OTHER 
TABLE IS FINISHED THESE TWO 
PLAYERS HAVE NOW GOT THE AUDITORIUM 
TO THEMSELVES WONDERFUL AUDITORIUM 
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS THERE IS NOT A 
SNOOKER PLAYER ANYWHERE THAT DOES 
NOT DREAM OF HAVING A CHANCE TO 
PLAY AT THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE 
WE WILL GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE 
DOUBT HE WAS TRAPPED IT WAS DIFFICULT SAFETY TO PLAY 
I JUST WONDER IF HE FANCIES THIS 
BLUE L. DO NOT KNOW IF HE CAN HOLD 
HOLE FOR THE RED THAT IS UP NEAR 
THE BLACK 
THE STANDARD HAS CERTAINLY GONE UP 
SINCE THE MID SESSION INTERVAL HE 
PLAYED SAFE THERE HE DID NOT FANCY 
ANYTHING NO POINT IN TAKING A CALL 
ON JUST TO WIN THE FRAME IF YOU DO 
NOT FANCY POTTING IT COTTER 
MACRO YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN 
EBDON TURNING ANYTHING DOWN 
COLOUR COLOUR NO PETER HAS AN EASY ONE CUSHION 
ESCAPE TO HIT THE RED UP PAST THE 
BROWN IF HE WANTS TO 
ONE OF THE BETTER SHOT WE HAVE SEEN 
THAT ONE THERE WAS DANGER IF YOU 
MISS IT THAT ONE FOR EBDON BUT HE 
HIT THAT PERFECT 
HE CAN EITHER DROP ON TO THIS RED 
OR HIT IT AT PACE IT DEPENDS HOW 
HE FEELS 
HE DID NEITHER HE NURTURED ON TO 
THE SIDE CUSHION TO PUT HIMSELF 
BACK IN TROUBLE HE NUDGED IT ON 
TO THE SIDE CUSHION 
SAY WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT THIS MAN 
BUT HE 
NOT HAVE PAUL SHARP 
SAID GREAT SNOOKER FROM THE 
PREVIOUS SHOT WHAT ABOUT THAT SHOT 
HE DOES NOT HAVE SHOT OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP CHAMPIONSHIP HE USED THE IMPRESSION THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT HE PLAYED TOP SHOT 
HE GIVES THE IMPRESSION AND HE PLAYED THAT PERFECTLY 
AS THE YELLOW IS THERE HE WILL 
JUST DROP THIS IN NOTHING FLASH 
HE HAS FINISHED SHORT ON THIS BUT 
HE STILL HAS A REASONABLY GOOD SHOT 
THAT LET TOPPING 
THE AIR 
AS SOON 
AS 
HE PLAYED THE YELLOW 
SHE A DISAPPOINTING I DO NOT THINK 
IT IS TO BUY IT THOUGH SHEILA 
THIS APPOINTMENT SHEER 
DISAPPOINTMENT 
FRAME BALL HE WAS ALMOST FORTY POINTS 
BEHIND 
THAT WAS A NERVELESS CLEARANCE FROM 
PETER RED ON HE 
HAS PULLED 
A FRAME 
BACK BUT 
ALI CARTER 
STILL LEADS 
TO 
ALL FIVE AND NINE TWELVE NINE 
THAT WAS A STRANGE BREAK OFF WITH 
THE CUE BALL ALMOST FINISHING 
BEHIND THE BROWN HE HAS LEFT FOR 
LONG RED ON FOR CARTER 
HE DIDN'T QUITE STREAK THAT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
STRIKE THAT THE BLACK WAS 
AVAILABLE IN THE SAME POCKET JUST 
THE SAFETY NOW 
AND WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T HIT THE 
BAULK COLOURS ON THE WAY DOWN 
HE HAS GOT A GOOD CHANCE HERE WITH 
THIS LONG RED 
HE COULD HAVE STUNG THAT IN ON 
THE BLACK BUT HE STILL PLAYED IT 
NICELY 
HE HAS FINISHED A BIT IN BETWEEN 
SHOTS 
HE IS ON A RED OUR PINKY IS ANYWAY 
I THINK HE IS ANYWAY 
HE WANTS TO TAKE THE RED CLOSEST TO 
THE BLACK SPOT 
HE PLAYED THIS GENTLY AND CAUGHT IT 
A LITTLE THICK THE RED IT MAY 
HAVE GONE INTO THAT CORNER POCKET WE THIS TEAM IS GOING 
TO THE BOTTOM 
WITH THE 
CUE BALL 
SO HE IS NOT 
PLAYING HE'S NOT PLAYING THE RUN 
THROUGH HE IS DEAD STRAIGHT IT IS THE KING OF SHOT 
THAT IS 
HARD 
TO 
POT WHEN 
YOU ARE TRYING 
TO SCREW BACK INTO THE BAULK AREA KIND OF SHOT 
I DON'T THINK HE CAN POT THE BLACK 
HE IS HOVERING HE DOES THIS PETER 
RED ON WHEN HE GETS AS HE WOULD 
CALL IT IN THE BOBBLE BUBBLE 
HE IS PLAYING TWO CUSHIONS IN 
BEHIND THE GREEN 
GOT A LITTLE KISS ON IT ON THE WAY 
DOWN HE HAS NOT HAD A GOOD 
RUN OF 
THE BALLS TO DATE BATTLE AT ALL 
GOOD SHOT THERE 
YES HE IS SNOOKERED 
HAS GOT TO 
FIND SOME KIND OF A WAY 
WASN'T A GREAT SHOT CERTAINLY WAS 
AN AWKWARD POSITION TO BE IN 
HOW CRUCIAL IS THAT GOING TO BE 
PETER RED ON DECLARED A FOUL ON 
HIMSELF PETER EBDON 
THE REFEREE WAS ON THE JOB AND 
PETER WAS GOING TO HELP HIM ANYWAY 
HE'S A TRUE SPORTSMAN 
THIS IS CARTER'S SECOND CLEAR CUT 
CHANCE TO TAKE THIS QUARTER FINAL 
CHANCE HE PLAYED A THIRTY EIGHT IN THE 
PREVIOUS ROUND AND THEN LOST 
POSITION 
IF HE IS FEELING THE PRESSURE HE 
SHOULD PROBABLY THINK HOW FORTUNATE 
HE IS 
THE CUE HAS BRUSHED AGAINST THE 
BLACK 
THE PINK SPOT IS OCCUPIED UP ONTO 
THE GREEN IS THE NEXT AVAILABLE HE 
HAS JUST GOT TO KEEP HIS 
CONCENTRATION FOR A FEW MORE SHOTS 
HE HAS COME OFF THE CUSHION QUICKLY 
HE HAS EITHER GOT A CHOICE OF BLUE 
OR YELLOW 
I JUST WONDER WHAT SORT OF NIGHT'S 
SLEEP ALI CARTER HAD WITH THE 
EXCITEMENT OF THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN LAST NIGHT 
AND THEN 
BEING OUT 
PLAYING OUT TEN 
O'CLOCK THIS 
MORNING BOTH 
PLAYERS 
HAD A PARTICULARLY EMOTIONAL 
EVENING 
I DIDN'T WANT THIS MATCH TO DRAG ON 
ANY LONGER THAN NECESSARY 
HE IS STILL NOT QUITE RIGHT THERE 
HE HAS GOT 
A RED 
TO GO 
FOUR BUT IT IS 
NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD 
HE PLAYED THE STUN OFF THE CUSHION 
TRYING TO CONCENTRATE TOO MUCH ON 
THE POT 
HE COULD HAVE PLAYED RIGHT 
UP THE TABLE AND GONE ONTO THE 
GREEN 
ANOTHER CHANCE SLIPS BY FOUR ALI 
CARTER AND 
PETER RED 
ON 
THE TABLE FACED 
WITH A 
TOUGH POT IT HAS TO BE SAID 
PETER EBDON 
YOU CAN SEE RIGHT DOWN THE LINE 
HERE IF HE HAD JUST PLAYED FOR 
THE BLUE 
AND 
TAKEN THE 
CHANCE 
HE WOULD 
PROBABLY HAVE POTTED THAT RED 
PETER SMILED BECAUSE HE FELT HE WAS 
UNLUCKY THAT HE HAD LEFT IT ON 
THERE WERE PLENTY 
OF 
BALLS THAT 
MIGHT HAVE 
STOPPED HIM GETTING 
THAT RED BUT HE HAS LEFT IT ON AND 
HE FEELS THAT HE HAS BEEN 
MADE TO 
PAY FOR 
HIS MISTAKES IN 
THE SESSION 
AND I WOULD NOT ARGUE WITH THAT 
WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE IF HE 
TAKES THE 
PINK IF 
IT GOES BACK ON 
ITS SPOT IT WOULD BE A BIG BEAD TO 
CARTER IF IT DOES THE BLACK ALSO 
GOES A BIG AID HE IS NOT GOING 
TO GET A BETTER CHANCE 
THE PINK IS IN THE OPEN THE FACT THAT THE BLACK DOES POT 
MEANS THAT THIS IS A GOLDEN 
OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE OUT THIS MATCH 
IT HAS BEEN A MATCH FEW PEOPLE WILL 
FORGET PETER EBDON'S ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE LAST 
NIGHT HE ALMOST MADE 
A MAXIMUM 
AND IN THE NEXT FRAME ALI CARTER 
DID MAKE THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BUT TO THE IT 
HAS NOT BEEN PETER EBDON'S SESSION 
AT ALL TODAY 
APPLAUSE FROM THE AUDIENCE HERE AT 
THE CRUCIBLE THAT IS JUST ABOUT IT NOW 
CAST YOUR MIND BACK TWELVE WANTS TO GO 
ALI CARTER BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED 
THAT HE LOST IN THE QUARTER FINALS 
OF THIS GREAT CHAMPIONSHIP HE WILL 
BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE REACHED HIS 
FIRST 
SEMI FINAL HERE 
IT HAS BEEN 
A GREAT MATCH 
PETER EBDON CARRIES ON BUT 
BARRING A NUMBER OF SNOOKERS ALI 
CARTER IS THROUGH TO THE SEMI 
FINALS 
MIRACLES DO HAPPEN BUT TWENTY TWO POINTS 
NEEDED IN SNOOKER'S HERE 
I THINK PETER IDDON WOULD HAVE 
CONCEDED AND STARTED THE NEXT FRAME 
BUT YOU 
CANNOT BLAME HIM FOR 
CARRYING ON HERE PETER EBDON 
THINKING ABOUT PLAYING THAT WITH A 
BIT OF SIDE TO MAKE THE POT 
POSSIBLE HE'S NOT QUITE ON IT BUT 
HE CAN MAKE IT 
PETER IS PLAY KNOWN BUT HE IS THE 
MAN IN THE SNOOKER PLAYING ON HE 
NEEDS A NUMBER OF SNOOKERS L. THINK 
WE ARE NOT FAR AWAY FROM THE 
HANDSHAKE 
THE END OFF WOULD HAVE SUMMED UP 
PETER'S MORNING THE IN OFF THAT SEALS IT 
JUST CLEARING THE COLOURS BUT ALI 
CARTER WILL BE THINKING ABOUT THE 
ONE TABLE SET UP FROM TOMORROW THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP SEMI FINALS 
DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT 
HE'S NEVER WON A RANKING TOURNAMENT 
BEFORE AND THIS 
WOULD BE QUITE 
GOOD ONE TO START WITH 
THE END OF A GREAT MATCH PETER 
EBDON BRILLIANT IN DEFEAT A TRUE 
GENTLEMAN BUT IT IS ALI CARTER 
DREW PUNCHES 
THE AIR 
AND 
IS THROUGH 
TO THE 
SEMI FINALS OF THE WORLD 
SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIPS AND WHAT A 
FINISH FROM THE MAN FROM ESSEX I I AM FINISHED I AM SO PLEASED 
PETER IS SUCH A COMPETITOR L. 
DELIGHTED TO BE IN THE SEMI FINALS 
I AM 
DELIGHTED FOR 
ALI CARTER 
BECAUSE HE HAS 
BEATEN 
TWO FORMER 
BECAUSE HE HAS BEATEN TWO FORMER CHAMPIONS 
TO GET TO 
THE SEMI FINAL 
HE 
IS A 
LOVELY LAD 
FOR 
MY OWN 
PART 
IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING 
PREPARATION WENT 
WELL AND 
I AM 
PREPARATION WENT WELL AND I AM PHYSICALLY FIT THAT WAS A MASSIVE 
GAMBLE LAYING 
MYSELF OUT 
FOR THIS 
ONE TOURNAMENT 
ALL SEASON I 
HAVE 
BEEN 
TRYING IN 
THE OTHER 
TOURNAMENTS 
BUT I HELD 
BACK ON 
PREPARATION AND 
TRY TO 
GIVE IT 
ALL 
FOR SHEFFIELD 
AND IT HASN'T 
WORKED OUT 
IT HAS 
BEEN A 
NEW 
EXPERIENCE FOR 
ME BEING IN 
THE 
SEMI FINALS 
HERE BUT 
I AM 
NOT 
EXPERIENCED AS A PLAYER IS A 
ON MY 
SIDE L. 
AM TWENTY NINTH 
THIS
