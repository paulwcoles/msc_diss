HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE SHOW I'M GEOFF LEACH AND THIS IS THE SURGERY 
TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GANGS AND CRIME ON OUR STREETS 
LAST YEAR THERE WERE THIRTY SEVEN KILLINGS IN WHICH BOTH VICTIM AND ASSAILANT WERE UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD 
AND A QUARTER OF ALL GUN CRIMES LAST YEAR WERE COMMITTED BY UNDER EIGHTEENS 
MORE THAN HALF OF KILLINGS ARE BELIEVED TO BE GANG RELATED 
SO HAS IT ALL BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION 
OR ARE WE AS THE TABLOIDS WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE A NATION RULED BY A GANG CULTURE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
NO IT'S OVER EXAGGERATED 
OVER EXAGGERATED DO YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT MAYBE 
WELL WE WENT OUT ONTO THE STREETS TO FIND OUT EXACTLY THAT 
HI I'M POLLY AND I'M POPPY 
TODAY WE'RE IN SHEFFIELD TALKING ABOUT TEEN GANGS 
SO ARE THEY REALLY A PROBLEM OR IS IT JUST THE MEDIA BLOWING THEM ALL OUT OF PROPORTION 
LET'S FIND OUT 
DO YOU THINK THE MEDIA EXAGGERATES TEEN GANGS OR DO YOU RECKON IT IS REALLY AN EPIDEMIC 
I THINK THE MEDIA EXAGGERATES IT 
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE MEDIA DOES YEAH 
I THINK IT'S A BIT OF BOTH I THINK THE MEDIA DOES EXAGGERATE WHAT HAPPENS IN TEEN GANGS 
BUT I THINK TEEN GANGS ARE AN ISSUE AND PEOPLE ARE GETTING HURT AND STUFF 
IT HAS BEEN A BIT BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION BECAUSE KIDS LIKE US 
WALK DOWN THE STREET PEOPLE FEEL INTIMIDATED JUST BECAUSE OF THE CLOTHES WE WEAR 
IT'S NOT AS BAD AS THEY MAKE IT OUT TO BE 
YEAH I'VE ONLY BEEN SMASHED IN ONCE AND THAT'S IT 
WHY DO TEENS JOIN GANGS 
TO BE PART OF SUMMAT TO FEEL SUMMAT 
JUST TO FEEL SAFE I THINK BECAUSE ROUND HERE THERE ARE STABBINGS MURDERS EVERYTHING 
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE PARENTS 
I THINK IF YOU DO JOIN A GANG IT COULD BE TO FEEL SAFE 
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO'S BEEN A VICTIM OF GANGS AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM 
THEY GOT SERIOUSLY BEAT UP AND PUT IN HOSPITAL 
I'VE NEVER BEEN AFFECTED BY A TEEN GANG 
I KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE IN GANGS AND I ASSOCIATE WITH THEM 
BUT NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT I'M LIKE ONE OF THEM 
YEAH CHILLING WITH THEM ON THE STREET AND STUFF 
ARE THE GIRLS AS VIOLENT IN THE GANGS AS WELL 
OF COURSE THEY RUN THAT GANG IF THE BOYS ARE SAYING DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD FIGHT THIS MAN 
YEAH GET ON WITH IT AND YOU ENCOURAGE VIOLENCE 
YEAH OF COURSE WE DO WELL NOT ENCOURAGE IT TO BE LIKE BULLIES BUT IF YOU'RE GETTING BEAT 
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH IT 
WOULD YOU SAY THERE ARE PRESSURES FOR TEENS TO BE IN GANGS 
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR GANG TO BACK YOU UP 
THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET NOWHERE ARE YOU 
A GANG CAN BE CLASSED AS A FAMILY BECAUSE EVERYONE'S THERE FOR YOU 
EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T GROWN UP TOGETHER YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT SOMEBODY 
EVEN IF IT'S JUST TWO OF YOU YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT SOMEBODY YOU CAN TELL THEM ANYTHING 
AND THEY'LL HELP YOU OUT ALWAYS TRY AND FIND SOMETHING 
IF ANYBODY'S AFTER YOU THEY'LL GO AFTER THEM TO PROTECT YOU 
SO THERE WE ARE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IS GANG CULTURE PART OF OUR U. K. BUILD OR IS IT OVER EXAGGERATED BY THE PRESS 
WELL I THINK PERSONALLY IT'S OVER EXAGGERATED 
BECAUSE THE PRESS ONLY KNOW THE BASICS 
LIKE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GO ON THE ROAD IT'S LIKE A CONCRETE JUNGLE 
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS BUT THE MEDIA SHOULD 
PORTRAY POSITIVE THINGS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DO AS WELL 
THEY DON'T DO THAT 
IT'S ALWAYS NEGATIVE NEGATIVE NEGATIVE 
YOU ONLY HEAR ABOUT OUR MUSIC THAT'S WHY 
THERE'S PROBABLY A REASON YOU FEEL THAT WAY WHAT'S YOUR STORY WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU 
WELL I'VE BEEN IN A GANG I ACTUALLY GOT IN A GANG AT THE AGE OF TWELVE 
WOW SO VERY YOUNG 
IS THAT A YOUNG AGE TO START WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT 
IS THAT QUITE USUAL NOWADAYS NOWADAYS THAT'S USUAL 
NOWADAYS THAT'S LATE 
WHY DO THINK THAT'S CHANGED THEN 
WHY ARE MORE AND MORE YOUNG PEOPLE CARRYING WEAPONS ON THE STREETS 
BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING IT 
BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE IS 
SO IN YOUR MIND IT'S 
IF THE NEXT MAN COMES TO YOU WITH A WEAPON YOU CAN'T LIKE BE EMPTY HANDED 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING INNIT 
SO YOU THINK IT'S LIKE SELF DEFENCE 
CARRYING A WEAPON WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT CLEAR IT'S AN OFFENCE TO CARRY A WEAPON 
YOU'VE GOT TO CARRY IT JUST IN CASE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN 
DO YOU FEEL MAYBE THAT BREEDS MAYBE MORE AND MORE VIOLENCE 
IF SOMEONE SHOWS YOU A KNIFE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN FIGHT THEM 
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE JACKIE CHAN YOU CAN FIGHT THEM 
UNLESS YOU ARE JACKIE CHAN IN WHICH CASE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT 
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE PRIMARY SOURCE EVERYONE BLAMES YOUNG PEOPLE 
THE PRIMARY SOURCE IS THE GOVERNMENT AND COUNCILS 
BECAUSE WHAT THEY DO THEY PUT ETHNIC MINORITIES AND 
THE LOWER CLASSES IN COUNCIL ESTATES AND IT BUILDS FROM THERE 
THERE'S A LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES IN THESE PLACES SO YOUNG PEOPLE 
RESORT TO SELLING DRUGS AND THINGS LIKE THIS 
AND THAT'S WHERE THE VIOLENCE COMES INTO IT BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY AND RESPECT 
SO ONE GANG OR A GROUP OF FRIENDS BECAUSE THERE'S A VERY THIN LINE 
BETWEEN A GANG AND A GROUP OF FRIENDS 
I'M SURE PEOPLE HERE HAVE MORE THAN ONE FRIEND 
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS YOU ARE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND YOU NEED MONEY 
SO WHAT THEY DO THEY RESORT TO DRUGS 
THEY GET THEIR LITTLE TERRITORY WHERE THEY DO IT 
BUT SOMEONE ELSE IN THE DEPRIVED NEIGHBOURHOOD 
ALSO SELLS DRUGS BUT WANTS TO MAKE MORE MONEY 
SO HE WANTS TO INVADE SOMEONE ELSE'S TERRITORY TO MAKE MORE 
SO IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY AND RESPECT 
WHEN SOMEONE'S COMING TO TAKE YOUR MONEY YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT AS A DISRESPECT 
THAT'S WHEN THE VIOLENCE COMES IN 
THAT'S WHEN THE VIOLENCE COMES IN 
WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF RACHEL 
YOU'VE HAD A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE OF GANG CULTURE 
I HAD A PARTY JUST AFTER GCSES 
AND A COUPLE OF GANGS ABOUT FOUR GANGS GATECRASHED THE PARTY 
AND THEY STABBED TWO FRIENDS OF MINE 
AND THEY BROKE THE DOOR OF MY NEIGHBOUR 
SHE DIDN'T HAVE DRUG WARS GOING ON INSIDE HER HOUSE 
SHE WASN'T INVITING GANGS INTO HER HOUSE THEY GATECRASHED THE PARTY 
AND GANG CULTURE AFFECTED YOU 
THEY GATECRASHED THE PARTY BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE IN THERE 
LIKE I SAID THIS WAS A SCHOOL PARTY 
AND SO OBVIOUSLY PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY FROM THE SCHOOL CAME 
THERE WERE GROUPS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THERE THAT WERE INVOLVED IN GANGS 
THE OTHER GANGS KNEW THAT THEY WOULD BE THERE 
SO THEY DELIBERATELY CAME TO CAUSE TROUBLE 
TO CAUSE TROUBLE THAT'S NOT REALLY THE RIGHT SITUATION IS IT 
WHAT HAPPENS IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE THERE AND THEY WANT TO START TROUBLE 
IT'S BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS THINGS AS WELL 
SAY YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET AND YOU GIVE A GUY A BAD LOOK LIKE LITERALLY A BAD LOOK 
IT CAN ALL START FROM THAT THAT ONE LOOK 
HAVE YOU HAD EXPERIENCE OF THAT I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE OF THAT 
BUT THEN THAT'S WHERE IT COMES DOWN TO YOU CHOOSING TO IGNORE THEM 
OR START A SITUATION AND GET INTO A BIG KNIFE CRIME OR 
GETTING SHOT THE NEXT DAY BECAUSE YOU GAVE THE GUY A LOOK BACK 
SO IT CAN ESCALATE VERY QUICKLY 
THEY SAY THAT'S THE GUY WHO GAVE ME A LOOK HE'S GOING TO BE THERE LET'S GO GET HIM 
IT'S FEAR AN INTIMIDATION THING THAT GOES ROUND ON ITSELF 
AND CREATES MORE FEAR AND INTIMIDATION 
IT STARTS FROM SMALL THINGS AND ESCALATES INTO BIGGER THINGS 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE SOMEONE A BAD LOOK TO GET KNIFED 
IF THEY SEE AN OPPORTUNITY DID THEY STEAL FROM YOUR HOUSE YES 
EXACTLY SO YOU HEAR ABOUT A HOUSE PARTY IF YOUR BOYS ROLL UP THAT'S HOW IT CAN ALL HAPPEN 
SHE DIDN'T EVEN INVITE THEM ALONG 
I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T PUT ON YOUR R. S. V. P. INVITE PLEASE BRING GANGS ALONG TO MY HOUSE 
JAY I WAS ALSO GOING TO ASK YOU 
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY HAD THOSE EXPERIENCES 
BUT YOU'VE CHANGED HOW YOU NOW LIVE YOUR LIFE HAVEN'T YOU 
YEAH HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO DO THAT AND WHAT YOU NOW DO 
AND HOW DO YOU REFLECT ON YOUR THOUGHTS WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCES WERE PREVIOUSLY 
WELL I PERSONALLY I USED TO SELL DRUGS MYSELF O. K. 
YEAH WAS THAT LIKE FLOSS SAYS TO GET MONEY TO BETTER YOURSELF 
YEAH AS I WAS GETTING OLDER I WAS EXPLORING THE FINANCIAL SIDE OF LIFE 
YEP SO I SAW A QUICK WAY TO GET MONEY 
FOR MYSELF IT WAS A QUICK WAY 
BUT IN REALITY IT WEREN'T YEAH 
I ENDED UP GOING TO PRISON SERVED SOME TIME 
SO ULTIMATELY THE COST WAS MUCH GREATER FOR YOU THAN GETTING THE MONEY 
YEAH IT RUINED MY HEAD IT RUINED MY WHOLE BRAIN 
I WAS DOWN ALL MAD AND THAT 
AND THEN I HAD ENOUGH TIME IN PRISON TO THINK ABOUT THE WAY I WANTED TO LIVE MY LIFE 
DID YOU REFLECT ON HOW YOU HAD BEEN LIVING YOUR LIFE 
I KNOW YOU WANT TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE AND THAT'S VERY COMMENDABLE 
BUT DO YOU REFLECT ON THE EXPERIENCES YOU HAD BEFORE 
IF YOU WERE DOING DRUGS AND YOU SAID YOU WERE PART OF A GANG 
WERE THERE VICTIMS OF WHAT YOU'D BEEN UP TO 
YEAH THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP OF PEOPLE THAT I ACTUALLY HURT 
IN THAT TIME I WAS IN PRISON I HAD TIME TO THINK AND I THOUGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING 
I MEAN EVERYTHING 
RACHEL HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS 
OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE BEEN EFFECTIVELY A VICTIM OF A BAD SITUATION RELATING TO GANGS 
JAY'S HERE SAYING HE'S HAD TIME TO REFLECT ON THAT AND WANTS TO BETTER HIMSELF 
I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH GANGS IS THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE GOING TO 
HAVE GANGS TRIBES AND GROUPS OF SIMILARLY INTERESTED PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD 
SINCE TIME BEGAN PEOPLE HAVE FORMED GROUPS 
SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE GROUPS 
IT'S JUST DEPENDS WHETHER THEY ARE VIOLENT OR NOT 
LET ME COME OVER HERE 
YOU SAID ABOUT DRUG DEALING YEAH WE WERE GOING TO A PARTY 
AND THEY GOT STOPPED BECAUSE THEY WERE AT THE WRONG END AND THEY WERE SERIOUSLY SCARED 
SO I HAD TO LIE FOR THEM AND SAY OH YEAH THEY PHONED THERE BECAUSE I KNEW THE ENDS INNIT 
BUT I WEREN'T THERE SOMETHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED 
SO BASICALLY I DON'T THINK FAIR ENOUGH DRUGS YEAH SCHOOL BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT 
SOME PEOPLE JUST FEEL BORED SO LET ME JUST GO AND SHACK SOMEONE THAT'S IT 
SO IT'S NO DIRECTION MAYBE 
SOME PEOPLE NEED TO WISE UP 
BECAUSE WE ARE FIGHTING OVER LAND THAT'S NOT EVEN OURS 
IT'S OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT WE DON'T EVEN OWN THE LAND 
SO WE NEED TO FIND A COMMON GROUND SO WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER 
I KNOW I'M TALKING LIKE WE'RE GOING TO CREATE SOME UTOPIA OR SOMETHING 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT 
MAYBE IF MORE PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WAY THERE WOULD BE LESS PROBLEMS 
I WANTED TO SAY THAT NOT ALL OF THIS IS ABOUT TERRITORIES OR BEING PART OF A GANG 
IT MOSTLY STARTS OFF AT HOME FAMILIES THAT HAVE BROKEN UP 
I DO THINK THERE IS A LEVEL OF YOUTH HAVING PROBLEMS BECAUSE 
THEY DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCES FROM THEIR PARENTS MAYBE 
I THINK THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MENTORS 
SERIOUS 
NOT ENOUGH POSITIVE ROLE MODELS THEY CAN FOLLOW AND SAY I WANT TO BE LIKE THAT 
I MIGHT HAVE TO GO THROUGH HARD WORK BUT 
WHITE PEOPLE HAVE GOT ROLE MODELS THAT ARE THERE FOR THEM 
THERE'S NOT MUCH MENTORS WE CAN LOOK INTO AND TRUST 
TALKING ABOUT ROLE MODELS IS QUITE INTERESTING WHO IS TO BLAME 
ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE SEEM TO RELATE TO GANG CRIME IS MUSIC 
ANOTHER RESPECT OF GANG CRIME HAS IT GOT LINKS WITH THE MUSIC INDUSTRY 
DOES THIS HAVE AN EFFECT ON GANG CULTURE IN THE U. K. 
WE WENT ON THE STREETS TO FIND OUT 
SO WHY DO TEEN GANGS EXIST 
IS MUSIC GLAMORISING VIOLENCE 
LET'S FIND OUT 
DO YOU THINK THAT MUSIC GLAMORISES VIOLENCE 
YEAH LIKE CHAV MUSIC THE R. AND AMP B. AND RAP ALL THEY TALK ABOUT IS VIOLENCE 
RAPPERS AND THINGS YEAH IT'S RAPPERS 
THEY THINK IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A GUN IN THEIR POCKET AND THEY WALK ABOUT THE STREETS 
THEY THINK IT'S CLEVER THEY THINK IT'S REALLY CLEVER 
THE KIND PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO RAP ARE MUCH MORE INFLUENCED BY IT AND FEEL IT'S SOMETHING 
THEY HAVE TO CARRY OUT PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO METAL JUST LISTEN TO IT 
AND THINK HA THAT'S FUNNY A BIT OF VIOLENCE 
YEAH I THINK IT GLAMORISES IT BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S TO BLAME 
IF SOMEONE CHOOSES TO LIKE GO AHEAD AND COPY SOMETHING OFF A MUSIC VIDEO OR COPY LYRICS 
AND TAKE IT INTO THEIR OWN HANDS THEN IT'S EXACTLY THAT 
IT'S THEIR OWN PROBLEM IT'S THEIR OWN FAULT 
DO YOU THINK THAT ARTISTS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE 
DEFINITELY YEAH DEFINITELY 
KIDS ARE EASILY INFLUENCED AND THEY'RE LOOKING UP TO THESE PEOPLE 
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPRESSING EITHER WHAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH OR WHAT THEY'VE FELT 
THEY'RE JUST STORYTELLERS YEAH 
THEY'RE NOT TEACHERS SAYING THIS IS WHAT YOU MUST GO OUT AND DO 
WHAT'S DESCRIBED IN URBAN SONGS AND R. AND AMP B. IS MUCH MORE 
POSSIBLE THAN WHAT THEY TALK ABOUT IN DEATH METAL 
IT'S ABOUT THE WAY PEOPLE ARE HOW THEY'VE BEEN BROUGHT UP NOT ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE ON M. T. V. 
LISTENING TO CERTAIN TYPES OF MUSIC DOESN'T MAKE YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND KILL PEOPLE 
BUT I AM SURE IT CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR SOME OF IT 
WHAT DO WE THINK IS THE MUSIC INDUSTRY IS GIVING A NEGATIVE EFFECT AS ROLE MODELS ON YOUNG PEOPLE 
HANG ON A SEC 
I DISAGREE 
IT'S BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN YEAH THAT MUSIC HAS THE ABILITY TO MANIPULATE YOUR THOUGHTS 
TO THOSE WHO WANT TO BE MANIPULATED NO BUT I'M SORRY 
IF YOU JUST SAY ONE TUNE IF I GO D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. 
EVERYBODY WILL LINK THAT TO MCDONALD'S 
AND WHAT YOU PUT IN IS WHAT'S GOING TO COME OUT DO YOU GET ME 
SO IF YOU ARE GOING TO PUT IN ALL THOSE NEGATIVE VIBES IN AT A VERY YOUNG AGE AS WELL 
THEY'RE NOT ON ENOUGH TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICE 
IF YOU ARE NINE LISTENING TO THIS MENTALITY OF GET RICH DIE TRYING 
OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE GOING TO THINK YEAH I DO LIVE IN THE GHETTO YEAH 
YOU'RE TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT FIFTY CENT IN THERE EXACTLY 
THE WHOLE GLAMORISED CULTURE THE MEDIA DO PORTRAY YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE VIOLENT 
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER GLAMORISING MEDIA THAT PROMOTES GANG CULTURE 
SAY YOUR POINT DOWN THERE FOR US THIS IS WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY 
MUSIC IS A PLATFORM FOR EXPRESSION 
IF YOU'RE LIVING THAT LIFE THEN THAT GIVES YOU THE CHANCE TO EXPRESS HOW YOU'RE FEELING 
MUSICIANS ARE STORYTELLERS 
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT GHETTO REALLY IS GHETTO IS NOT LIVING IN A HACKNEY ESTATE 
GHETTO IS GOING TO POOR COUNTRIES LIKE IN SOUTH AFRICA 
WHERE YOU'RE LIVING IN A SHACK WHERE ALL YOUR FAMILIES ARE LIVING IN THE ONE BEDROOM 
YOU CAN'T TELL ME YOU'VE GROWN UP IN LONDON WHERE YOU GET FREE EDUCATION 
FREE HEALTH YOU LIVE IN THE GHETTO NO YOU DON'T WHO'S TOLD YOU THAT 
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING THAT MUSIC PROMOTES AS IF WE LIVE IN THE GHETTO WHEN WE DON'T 
IT'S DIFFERENT WITH THE HIP HOP IT TENDS TO BE MOSTLY AMERICANS 
AND THEY TALK ABOUT WHERE THEY COME FROM IT'S LIKE TELLING THE ARTIST HOW TO DRAW YOU CAN'T DO THAT 
I UNDERSTAND ALL YOUR POINTS 
IF A YOUNG PERSON LOOKS AT LIKE FIFTY CENT WHO'S GOT ALL THE JEWELLERY ON 
IF THEY LOOK AT HIM AND THEY SEE THE VIDEO AND THEY SAY YEAH I WANT THAT 
AND THEN WHAT'S ON THE ROAD 
YOU SEE YOU IN YOUR OWN EYES YOU SEE WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING ON THE ROADSIDE CAN BRING THAT MONEY IN 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET THAT IT DOESN'T MEAN 
IT'S DOWN TO DIFFERENTIATE 
IT MIGHT LIKE GLAMORISE IT AND SAY IT MIGHT MAKE ME WANT TO CARRY A GUN 
BUT IT'S DOWN TO ME AT THE END OF THE DAY IF I WANTED TO GET IT IT'S DOWN TO ME 
WHAT IF THEY'RE TOO YOUNG TO MAKE THAT CHOICE 
THERE ARE KIDS OUT THERE LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE DO THEIR STUFF 
TALKING ABOUT GUNS AND CRIME AND STUFF AND THEN THEY GET INTO IT 
THEN THEY START THEY START COMING UP WITH THEIR OWN TRACKS 
AND ALL THEIR TRACKS INVOLVE YEAH I'M CARRYING MY SHANK 
THEY'VE NEVER SEEN STUFF LIKE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE TALKING LIKE THAT THEY'RE TOO YOUNG 
BUT PEOPLE OUR AGE WE CAN DEAL WITH IT WE CAN SAY WE KNOW THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT 
BUT YOU COULDN'T MAKE YOUR DECISION WHEN YOU'RE NINE YEARS OLD 
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING YEAH 
BASICALLY WHY DO WE ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE NEGATIVE RAPPERS 
THERE ARE SOME POSITIVE RAPPERS OUT THERE IT'S ABOUT YOUR UPBRINGING 
YOU WILL KNOW BY THE AGE OF TEN WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S WRONG 
MY LITTLE BROTHER KNOWS IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW YOU'RE BROUGHT UP 
YOU ARE A PRODUCT OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT 
MUSIC DOES HAVE A LARGE INFLUENCE ON THE WAY YOUNG PEOPLE ACT THEY LIKE TO COPY WHAT'S ON THE MEDIA 
AND IT'S LIKE SOME SORT OF BECAUSE THEY IDOLISE THESE PEOPLE 
YEAH WHEN YOU SAY MUSIC WHAT TYPE OF MUSIC ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
MAINLY GRIME R. AND AMP B. YEAH 
GRIME ARTISTS YOU THINK THEY'RE WHAT RACE LISTENS TO THAT ALL RACES LISTEN TO IT 
NOT NECESSARILY NOT NECESSARILY NO I DISAGREE I GO TO GRIME NIGHTS ALL THE TIME AND I'M WHITE 
MY MATES ARE ASIAN AND BLACK AND WE ALL GO AND LISTEN TO GRIME NIGHTS I'M SAYING THAT MUSIC IS STRONG 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WANT TO LEARN SPANISH OR FRENCH 
YOU HAVE THEM C. D.'S IN YOUR HEAD AND YOU LEARN IT 
SO WHY IS IT THAT MAIN GUN CRIME IS DONE BY BLACK PEOPLE THEN IF YOU'RE SAYING MUSIC IS LARGELY AN INFLUENCE 
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE BASICALLY TRYING TO SAY 
BLACK PEOPLE ARE GETTING SHOT WHITE PEOPLE ARE GETTING STABBED 
BUT I DON'T THINK THE MEDIA SHOWS THE TRUE PICTURE 
THEY CHOOSE WHAT THEY WANT TO SHOW THEY DON'T SHOW EVERYTHING 
SO YOU BELIEVE THERE'S A CENSORSHIP 
THE MEDIA PORTRAYS STATISTICS THAT WHAT'S BEING RECORDED 
THAT'S WHAT'S BEING REPORTED MUSIC DEFINITELY HAS AN INFLUENCE 
I'M NOT SAYING HOLD ON A MINUTE 
I'M NOT SAYING YEAH THAT MUSIC PICKS UP YOUR HANDS AND MAKES YOU SHOOT I'M NOT SAYING THAT 
BUT IT HAS AN INFLUENCE NOBODY CAN SAY I HAVEN'T BEEN INFLUENCED BY ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU'RE A LIAR 
EVEN SCIENTISTS YEAH 
REPLY TO HER 
BRING THE MICROPHONE CLOSER 
LISTEN YEAH HOLD ON HOLD ON WAIT 
I M. C. YEAH I POSITIVE M. C. ALL MY BARS ARE ABOUT POSITIVE THINGS 
STOP GUNS STOP VIOLENCE KNOW ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE OUR HISTORY YEAH 
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING THAT INFLUENCES ME IS A LIE 
BECAUSE THINGS THAT INFLUENCE ME IS GOD MY PEOPLE YOU GET ME 
YOU'RE PARAPHRASING WHAT I SAID IN A COUNTRY WHERE THERE'S NO MUSIC THEY'VE GOT KIDS FIGHTING WARS 
AND THERE'S NO MUSIC THERE SO WHAT'S THE INFLUENCE 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE RIGHT IDEA OF WHAT I'M SAYING 
YOU'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT I'M SAYING CAN YOU LET ME SPEAK 
LET HER REPLY TO YOUR COMMENT 
CALM DOWN I'M AN M. C. MYSELF 
I SPEAK POSITIVELY MYSELF 
I'M NOT SAYING YEAH 
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT MUSIC HAS THE POWER TO INFLUENCE 
AND EVERYONE HAS BEEN INFLUENCED DO YOU GET ME 
HANG ON A SEC 
YOU THOUGHT THERE WAS A LACK OF ROLE MODELS 
WHERE'S THE ROLE MODELS AT 
EXACTLY I AGREE WITH YOU BUT DO YOU NOT THINK FOR THOSE PEOPLE 
THAT DON'T HAVE ROLE MODELS THEY LISTEN TO THE MEDIA MORE 
AND BIG ARTISTS THAT HAVE 
GO CHAT TO SOMEONE SAY I FEEL LIKE THIS 
WHAT'S YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE WHAT DO FEEL ABOUT THE GUN CULTURE GANG CRIME 
I PERSONALLY HAVEN'T HAD ANY EXPERIENCES OF IT AT ALL 
AND I THINK THE MEDIA DOES EXAGGERATE IT A LOT 
I THINK IT DEPENDS WHAT AREAS YOU GO TO 
I PERSONALLY COME FROM QUITE A SHELTERED BACKGROUND AND I THINK 
IT'S AVOIDABLE I THINK THEY ALSO ONLY AIR IT WHEN THERE'S NOTHING 
ELSE MAJOR GOING ON IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO FILL A GAP 
YEAH GO AHEAD YOU'RE SAYING MUSIC ALL HAVE THEIR INFLUENCE 
O. K. I WENT THROUGH A PHASE WHERE I DIDN'T LISTEN TO ANY RAPPERS AND R. AND AMP B. 
I LISTENED TO MY OWN KIND OF MUSIC THERE WAS THE ASIAN INDIAN MUSIC 
BUT BECAUSE OF THE PLACE I LIVED IN I STILL CARRIED A SHANK 
I STILL CARRIED A SHANK IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE MUSIC 
SO YOU'RE SAYING 
GUYS GUYS DO WE ALL AGREE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE INFLUENCED BY THE MUSIC YOU LISTEN TO 
WE DO NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF SPITTING POSITIVELY 
WE CAN AGREE THAT IF WE ALL ROSE TOGETHER AND SPOKE ABOUT IT MORE 
AND ALSO DECIDED WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO DO CHANGE THE SITUATION 
THEN WE MIGHT BE IN A BETTER SITUATION 
DON'T FORGET TO JOIN KELLY OSBOURNE ON THE SURGERY SUNDAY NIGHT ON RADIO ONE AT TEN P. M. 
JOIN ME NEXT WEEK I'LL SEE YOU THEN 
HIS LIFE IS DONE LOST TO A GUN 
MOTHER AND FATHER HAVE NO SON 
I SEE HIS FACE IN THE RISING SUN 
JUST ANOTHER DEATH IN THE HIDING SLUMS 
WE LIVE IN ENGLAND 
IT'S NOT A GHETTO I GO OUT WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE KNIVES 
BUT YOU CAN STILL LIVE AN EASY LIFE 
THE GUNS ARE KILLING US 
AND I THINK I'VE HAD ENOUGH 
AND WE GOT TO STOP IT NOW BEFORE THE PAIN TAKES OVER US 
I'M LESS WELL OFF THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE IN GANGS AND I'M NOT IN A GANG 
SO THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR IT BASICALLY 
AND I'M OUT
