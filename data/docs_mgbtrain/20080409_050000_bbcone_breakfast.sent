ABANDON HIS TEN YEAR LEGAL BATTLE 
TO PROVE HIS BELIEF THIS HIS SON 
AND DIANA PINCESS OF WALES WERE 
MURDERED EARLIER THIS WEEK AN 
INQUEST RULED THAT DIANA AND DODI 
FAYED WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED DUE TO 
THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF THE DRIVER 
HENRI PAUL AND THE PAPARAZZI 
VEHICLES CHASING THEM 
ENOUGH IS 
ENOUGH AND FOR THE SAKE OF THE TWO 
PRINCES I KNOW THEY LOVE THEIR 
MOTHER I SAW THEM ON HOLIDAY AND 
I'M SURE THEY ARE BLESSING IN THEIR 
DEEP HEART WHAT I'M DOING TO

I HAVE ENOUGH I'M LEAVING THE REST 
FOR GOD TO GET MY REVENGE

TWO CHARITIES WILL BEGIN LEGAL 
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT 
TODAY IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE A NEW 
APPROACH TOWARDS THE PROBLEM OF 
FUEL POVERTY THREE MILLION 
HOUSEHOLDS ARE EXPECTED TO 
EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES PAYING FUEL 
BILLS IN ENGLAND ALONE THIS YEAR 
CAMPAIGNERS SAY THE GOVERNMENT IS 
IN DANGER OF MISSING ITS TARGETS ON 
ERADICATING THE PROBLEM FOR 
VULNERABLE FAMILIES WHAT DOES FUEL 
POVERTY MEAN 
TO THIS WOMAN A SEVENTY TWO 
YEAR OLD IN BRISTOL IT MEANS 
CHOOSING FOOD OVER HEAT IT MEANS 
CAREFULLY RATIONING THE CENTRAL 
HEATING AND GOING TO BED EARLY WHEN 
IT GETS TOO COLD 
IT IS WORRYING 
IT'S THE BIGGEST WORRY REALLY THE 
PRICES GO UP YOU THINK I BETTER 
NOT PUT IT ON 
MANY VULNERABLE PEOPLE ARE IN THE 
SAME POSITION 
THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN ADVISORY GROUP 
ON ENERGY SAYS THAT THIS YEAR FUEL 
POVERTY COULD REACH ITS HIGHEST 
LEVEL FOR DECADE BUT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS TARGET TO TAKE 
ALL VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN ENGLAND 
OUT OF FUEL POVERTY BY TWO THOUSAND TEN AND TO 
ERADICATE FUEL POVERTY ACROSS THE 
U. K. BY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN 
IT WILL BE TOUGH AND TODAY FRIENDS 
OF THE EARTH AND HELP THE AGED WILL 
FILE PAPERS WITH THE HIGH COURT IN 
AN ATTEMPT TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT 
TO RAMP UP ITS EFFORT TO END FUEL 
POVERTY 
THE GOVERNMENT MISSED THE POVERTY OPPORTUNITY TO DO ANYTHING IN 
COMPREHENSIVE SPENDING REVIEW IT 
MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE 
BUDGET WHICH WE HAD LAST MONTH 
NOW IT SEEMS TO US THAT A JUDICIAL 
REVIEW IN THE HIGH COURT IS AN 
APPROPRIATE TOOL AN APPROPRIATE 
WEAPON TO PUT INTO THE EQUATION 
THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS IT HAS A 
STRONG SET OF MEASURES IN PLACE TO 
TACKLE FUEL POVERTY INCLUDING THE 
WARM FRONT SCHEME AND WINTER FUEL 
PAYMENTS WHICH WERE GIVEN BOOST 
IN THE BUDGET BUT IT'S FACING THE 
HEAT AS PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO MEET 
THE COSTS OF THE COLD

MORE OFF THE MORTGAGE BUSINESS 
ELSEWHERE IN THE ECONOMY CONSUMER 
CONFIDENCE HAS FALLEN TO A NEW LOW

THIRTY NINE THOUSAND N. H. S. STAFF SAY THEY FACED 
ABUSE OF SOME KIND IN THE LAST YEAR 
ALSO COMING UP TODAY TIM MUFFETT 
IS ASKING IF FLOWERS OR FOUR BY FOURS TAKE 
PRIORITY IN YOUR GARDEN 
HAVE YOU GOT PLANS FOR YOUR FRONT 
GARDEN THINKING OF PAVING IT OVER 
AND TURNING IT INTO A 
DRIVEWAY LIKE 
THIS ONE 
IN A 
FEW 
MONTHS THAT 
COULD GET A LOT MORE COMPLICATED L. 
WILL EXPLAIN WHY IN JUST A MOMENT 
FIRST THOUGH MORNING CAROL 
SADLY GEORGE CLOONEY IS NOT IN THE 
GARDEN WITH ME THIS MORNING BUT IT 
IS A COLD START TO THE DAY WE HAVE 
HAD A TOUCH OF FROST TEMPERATURES 
IN SOME PAST PART OF THE SOUTH OF 
ENGLAND DIPPED DOWN TO MINUS THREE 
WE ARE LOOKING AT SUNSHINE AND SOME 
OF AND SOME SHOWERS 
WE HAVE HAD RAIN OVER PARTS OF 
SCOTLAND AND SHOWERS AND OTHER 
PARTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES IN 
SCOTLAND AT NINE O'CLOCK AGAIN WE 
HAVE SOME RAIN AROUND AND ALSO SOME 
WINTRY WEATHER ESPECIALLY TO THE 
HILLS BUT ANYWHERE TODAY EVEN TO 
LOWER LEVELS IN SCOTLAND AND 
ENGLAND WE COULD SEE THE WINTRY 
MIX FURTHER SOUTH THERE WILL BE 
SOME LOVELY BLUE SKIES THIS MORNING 
THERE IS A TOUCH OF FROST AND THEN 
MAYBE THE ODD ICY PATCH ON 
UNTREATED SURFACES ONLY THREE 
DEGREES IN PLYMOUTH BY NINE O'CLOCK 
ONE OR TWO SHOWERS FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND THIS MORNING BUT ALSO SOME 
SUNNY SPELLS THAT SETS UP A 
PICTURE 
FOR THE 
REST OF 
THE DAY 
QUITE NICELY BECAUSE THE FORECAST 
IS LARGELY ONE OF SUNSHINE AND 
SHOWERS SOME OF THE SHOWERS WILL 
BE HEAVY ESPECIALLY SO IN EASTERN 
AREAS SAY 
EAST OF ENGLAND AND AS WE GO THROUGH THE 
DAY TEMPERATURES PEAKING AT ABOUT 
THIRTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS WHICH IS AN 
IMPROVEMENT ON YESTERDAY THEN 
THROUGH THIS EVENING AT OVERNIGHT 
THERE WILL STILL BE SOME SHOWERS 
AROUND THERE WILL ALSO BE SOME 
BREAKS IN THE CATT SO SOME FROST 
DEVELOPING YOU CAN SEE THE NEXT 
BAND OF RAIN COMING IN ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND PARTS OF 
WESTERN ENGLAND FOR MANY PARTS OF 
ENGLAND IT IN PARTICULAR WE ARE 
LOOKING AT SOME SUNSHINE TOMORROW 
TEMPERATURES RECURVING BY DEGREE OR 
SO WE ARE LOOKING AT EIGHT TO FOURTEEN THE 
OUTLOOK REMAINS UNSETTLED AND AGAIN 
THE WINTRY ELEMENT TO THE WEATHER 
DYING AWAY WE WILL PROBABLY SEE IT 
IN THE HILLS ACROSS THE NORTH OF 
THE COUNTRY SCOTT ACROSS 
SCOTLAND TEMPERATURES AGAIN 
ROUNDABOUT AVERAGE FOR THE TIME OF 
YEAR THAT'S HOW IT IS LOOKING 
ONE SOLUTION TO CAR PARKING 
PROBLEMS FOR MANY HOMEOWNERS IS TO 
GET RID OF THE GREEN IN THE FRONT 
GARDEN PAVE OVER IT THERE ARE 
FEARS THIS INCREASES THE RISK OF 
FLOODING AND THAT 
MEANS THINGS 
ARE 
ABOUT TO CHANGE FOR 
THOSE PLANNING 
TO POUR CONCRETE OVER THE 
CHRYSANTHEMUMS TIM MUFFETT IS IN 
HOPE TO 
EXPLAIN ALL GOOD MORNING 
TIM TIM GOOD MORNING L. HAVE A TALE OF TWO 
FRONT GARDENS HERE THE OWNERS 
HAVE PAVED OVER THE 
FRONT GARDEN 
AND TURNED INTO A DRIVEWAY NEXT 
DOOR THEY HAVEN'T DONE 
IT YET 
BUT 
THEY ARE THINKING 
ABOUT BUT 
THEY DON'T 
DO IT 
SOON 
IT COULD 
BECOME A LOT MORE COMPLICATED 
WHEN THERE IS A FLOOD DISRUPTION 
AND MISERY ARE SURE TO FOLLOW BUT 
ARE THEY BEYOND OUR CONTROL OR 
HAVE OUR ACTIONS ACTUALLY MADE THEM 
MORE LIKELY PAVED OVER FRONT 
GARDENS ARE INCREASINGLY POPULAR 
CHOICE FOR MANY IT CAN BE A 
CONVENIENT PLACE TO PARK YOUR CAR 
BUT WHEREAS GRASS WALSALL IS GOOD 
AND PUBS AT ABSORBING WATER 
PAVING ASH UP OR CONCRETE IS NOT 
IN FACT IT CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT 
OF WATER WHICH RUNS OFF BY UP TO FIFTY 
PER CENT IF THERE IS JUST ONE GARDEN 
THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM BUT IF MANY 
GARDENS IN ONE STREET DO IT THAT 
WATER HAS GOT TO GO SOMEWHERE 
USUALLY INTO A DRAIN BUT SOMETIMES 
TRAINS CAN'T COPE SO IN ENGLAND 
PAVING YOUR FRONT GARDEN IS SET TO 
GET HARDER LATER THIS YEAR FOR 
THE FIRST TIME YOU WILL NEED 
PLANNING PERMISSION THE ONLY 
EXCEPTION WILL BE SPECIALLY 
DESIGNED POROUS PAVING OR GRAVEL 
ANNE HAS HAD HER FRONT GARDEN PAVED 
OVER 
I THINK THE PARKING HAS OVER GRADUALLY GOT WORSE OVER THE LAST 
YEAR AND THAT MAYBE MAKE MY MIND UP 
BY GETTING IT DONE NOW TO RELIEF SHE 
HAS AVOIDED 
PLANNING PERMISSION THAT OTHERS 
WILL SOON NEED 
IT MIGHT STOP SOME 
PEOPLE GOING AHEAD WITH DOING IT 
THERE ARE PROBABLY 
A LOT 
OF 
WHO CAN'T BE BOTHERED WITH THE 
HASSLE YOU START DOING AL 
FEW 
THINGS 
YOU HIT A YOU THINK YOU WILL LEAVE IT THE THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY HAVE 
BEEN CALLING FOR TOUGHER 
REGULATIONS FOR YEARS THEY ARE 
DELIGHTED WITH THE NEW RULES 
IT IS 
THE FIRST LEGISLATION THAT ACTUALLY 
DIRECTLY LINKS TO FRONT GARDENS AND 
GIVE GIVES PROPER PROTECTION THE 
THINGS BEFORE HAVE BEEN RATHER 
PERIPHERAL AND OPEN TO 
INTERPRETATION SO THIS SET SIT 
DOWN AND SAYS WE CAN PROTECT FRONT 
GARDENS 
THERE THE SOCIETY GARDENS BELIEVES THAT ANYONE DETERMINED TO 
TRANSFORM THEIR FRONT GARDEN SHOULD 
AT LEAST CONSIDER GRAVEL LIKE THE 
OWNER OF THIS DRIVEWAY THEY HAVE 
USED GRAVEL HERE HAVEN'T THEY 
THEY HAVE AND THAT IS GREAT THERE 
ARE PLENTY OF GAPS BETWEEN GRAVEL 
AND THOSE ALLOW THE WATER THROUGH 
INTO THE GROUND BELOW 
FLOODS ARE 
IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP ALTOGETHER BUT 
MANY FIRMLY BELIEVE THEY WILL BE 
LESS LIKELY IF THERE ARE FEWER OF 
THESE THESE IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT TWO 
THIRDS OF THE HOUSES DAMAGED DURING 
LAST YEAR'S FLOODS WERE DAMAGED BY 
FOR SURFACE WATER RUNNING OFF THE 
DAMAGE OF COURSE RAN INTO BILLIONS 
OF POUNDS WHEN WILL THESE CHANGES 
GOING TO TAKE PLACE WE THINK 
AROUND OCTOBER TIME ALTHOUGH THAT 
HASN'T YET BEEN CONFIRMED 
MEANWHILE TODAY THE NORWICH UNION 
SAYS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF 
HOUSES AFFECTED BY FLOODING LAST 
YEAR HAVE DONE NOTHING OR VERY 
LITTLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PROPERTIES 
AND TO LESSEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF 
FLOODING THEY SAY PEOPLE SHOULD BE 
PUTTING SEALS ON THEIR DOORS ON 
THEIR WINDOWS MAYBE EVEN 
INSTALLING A PUMP MEANWHILE MANY 
PEOPLE WILL THINK HANG ON IS IT 
REALLY DOWN TO US WHAT ABOUT WATER 
AUTHORITIES AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
SHOULD THEY NOT BE IMPROVING THE 
DRAINAGE BUT IF YOU WANT TO DO PAY 
DO THIS PAVING OVER YOUR DRIVING 
ENGLAND THAT 
PROCESS IS 
GOING TO 
BECOME A LOT MORE DIFFICULT 
WHY DID YOU SEND US YOUR THOUGHTS 
ABOUT THAT TO US 
HAVE A LOOK AT THESE PICTURES THEY 
ARE VERY INTERESTING 
IT IS THE ANNUAL SPRING MIGRATION 
OF THE NEMATIC NOMADIC SAMI 
PEOPLE AND THEIR REINDEER TWO OF 
THE HERDERS WILL BE HERE TO SHOW US 
HOW THE TRADITIONAL LIFE IS

A PLEA OF GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY 
AMID THE SPECULATION THERE'S BEEN 
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS OVER WHAT 
KAREN MATTHEWS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE 
DONE THIS WILL BE THE FIRST REAL 
OPPORTUNITY TO GET SOME FACT MAYBE 
A LITTLE DETAIL PERVERTING THE 
COURSE OF JUSTICE IN PARTICULAR IS 
AN OFFENCE WHICH COVERS A WIDE 
RANGE OF POSSIBLE ACTIONS SO WE'LL 
HEAR IN COURT TODAY EXACTLY WHAT IT 
IS THAT THE POLICE AND THE 
PROSECUTORS SAY THAT KAREN MATTHEWS 
HAS DONE ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE FOR 
THE COURTS TO DECIDE WHETHER SHE'S 
GUILTY OF ANY OFFENCE 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF N. H. S. STAFF SAY THEY'VE BEEN 
SUBJECTED TO HARASSMENT OR BULLYING 
WHILE AT WORK WITH THIRTEEN PER CENT CLAIMING 
THEY'VE BEEN PHYSICALLY ABUSED 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND N. H. S. WORKERS WERE QUESTIONED

CARRIED THROUGH SAN FRANCISCO TODAY 
AND MORE PRO TIBET DEMONSTRATIONS 
ARE EXPECTED THE CHINESE 
AUTHORITIES SAY THE TORCH WILL 
VISIT TIBET AS PART OF ITS TOUR 
IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO 
PLAY IN FRONT OF OUR SUPPORTERS 
YOU COULD HEAR THEM FROM THE START 
OF THE GAME 
I FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE THIS 
AMAZING FOR THE PLAYERS THEY DON'T 
GIVE UP BECAUSE THEY HEAR THE 
PEOPLE 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND FOR ME IT WAS NO 
PENALTY TONIGHT L. WATCHED IT 
CLEARLY AGAIN 
AND LAST WEEK IT WAS A REAL PENALTY 
BUT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT AND AS 
WELL TO ACCEPT THAT IN A GAME LIKE 
THAT THAT WE HAD SO MUCH CONTROL 
WE WERE TOO NAIVE WE LACKED A 
LITTLE BIT OF MATURITY DEFENSIVELY 
CHELSEA MADE HARD WORK OF THEIR 
PROGRESS TO THE SEMI FINAL AGAINST 
FEN BATCHY BUT THEY'RE SAFELY 
THROUGH THROUGH MICHAEL BALLACK SCORED AND THEN 
FRANK LAMPARD SCORED SECURING A 
FOURTH CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI FINAL 
PLACE IN FIVE YEARS THEY WILL NOW 
FACE LIVERPOOL

HOPING TO MAKE IT THREE ENGLISH 
CLUBS THROUGH TO THE SEMIES THEY 
HAVE TWO TO ZERO LEAGUE TO THE FIRST LEG

RONALDO AND WAYNE ROONEY SCORED IN 
THE AWAY TIE 
MUCH IS EXPECTED OF THIS GAME THEY 
BEAT THE ITALIAN SIDE SEVEN TO ONE WHEN THEY 
PLAYED LAST SEASON 
TO GET TO A 
SEMI FINAL IS TO APPROACH THE GAME 
IN THE BEST FASHION AND WANE IT WE 
CANNOT LOOK AT THE GAME AT ROMA AS 
A PASS INTO THE SEMI FINAL WE GOT 
THERE BECAUSE WE WORKED OUR SOCKS 
OFF BECAUSE THE TEAM DISCIPLINE 
WAS GOOD TACTICALLY IT WAS GOOD ON 
THE NIGHT THAT'S THE KIND OF 
PERFORMANCE WE NEED PORTSMOUTH PORTSMOUTH AREN'T GOING TO BE DISTRACTED BY 
THE F. A. CUP FINAL THEY BEAT WEST

EVERY DAY 
SOME SHOCKING STATISTICS OUT TODAY 
ONE QUARTER OF N. H. S. STAFF IN ENGLAND 
CLAIMED THEY'D BEEN HARASSED OR 
ABUSED WHILE DOING THEIR JOB MORE 
THAN ONE IN TEN SAY THEY'VE BEEN 
PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED THE FINDINGS 
OF THE N. H. S. STAFF SURVEY ARE WIDELY 
REGARDED AS A BETTER INDICATOR OF 
WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IN OUR 
HOSPITALS THAN OFFICIAL RECORDS SO 
ARE THE FIGURES AS BLEAK AS THEY 
FIRST SEEM KAREN JENNINGS IS FROM 
THE TRADE UNION UNISON THANK YOU 
FOR JOINING US IS THIS SOMETHING 
YOU SEE REFLECTING IN YOUR MEMBERS 
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THIS SURVEY IS 
AFTER YEARS OF SURVEYING OUR STAFF 
ABOUT VIOLENCE IT'S CLEAR THAT 
EVEN WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S MONEY 
THAT THEY'VE INJECTED INTO THE N. H. S. 
THIS CONTINUES TO BE SERIOUS CONCERN 
IT CONTINUES TO BE A CONCERN CONCERN IS THERE A SENSE ALSO THAT 
IT'S PERHAPS GETTING WORSE NO NO IT'S NOT GETTING WORSE THEY'VE 
MANAGED TO KEEP THE LEVEL OF 
VIOLENCE AT A CONSISTENT LEVEL OVER 
THE LAST FOUR YEARS BUT WHAT WE 
WANT TO SEE IS TOP DOWN 
INITIATIVES GIVING GUIDANCE TO 
TRUSTS GIVING HOW TO MANAGE 
VIOLENCE STAFF NEED TO FEEL 
THEY'RE BACKED UP BY MANAGERS WHEN 
THERE'S A VIOLENT INCIDENT 
CERTAINLY A LOT MORE EDUCATION AND 
TRAINING ABOUT PREVENTING VIOLENCE 
IT'S STRIKING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 
STATISTICS THAT AMBULANCE STAFF 
FOR EXAMPLE ARE SEEN PARTICULARLY 
VULNERABLE OR OFTEN AND ARE OFTEN 
ABUSED IN ATTACKS 
YES I GUESS 
THAT'S NOT TOO SURPRISING WHEN YOU 
THINK OF SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
THAT AMBULANCE PARAMEDICS 
TECHNICSS HAVE TO RESPOND TO ON A 
FRIDAY NIGHT IT'S THE SAME FOR 
STAFF IN MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITALS 
WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS THE PUBLIC 
TO BE ABSOLUTELY AWARE THAT 
PROSECUTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE 
THERE'S SOME REALLY EXCELLENT 
EXAMPLES OF WHERE THE POLICE ARE 
WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE 
AMBULANCE SERVICE THERE'S A GOOD 
EXAMPLE OF THAT IN KENT BUT THAT 
SORT OF EXAMPLE NEEDS TO BE 
REPLICATED ACROSS THE COUNTRY SOME SOME PLACES DO HAVE POSTERS WHICH DO 
KIND OF LAY IT OUT CLEARLY IF YOU 
ABUSE STAFF THIS IS WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN 
YES POSTERS ARE IMPORTANT HAPPEN BUT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR 
MANAGEMENT WILL SUPPORT YOU AND 
CARRY THROUGH THAT PROSECUTION 
THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF CHANGES IN THE 
N. H. S. BIG CHANGEOVERS OF MANAGERS 
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
MANAGERS THEMSELVES NEED EDUCATING 
AND TRAINING THAT THIS IS A KEY 
ISSUE THAT STAFF ARE VERY 
FRIGHTENED TO COME TO WORK THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH TIME FOR A QUICK 
LOOK THROUGH THE FRONT PAGES OF THE 
PAPERS 
PAPERS PAPERS THE DAILY TELEGRAPH ONE OR TWO 
PAPERS LOOKING AT PROPERTY PRICES 
ONE HERE SAYING THE I. M. F. WARN 
MORTGAGES MAY COST THREE THOUSAND MORE 
IN THE TIMES THEY HAVE PICTURES OF 
FRONT DOORS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF 
BRITAIN AND SHOW THE CHANGES IN THE 
AVERAGE HOUSE OF PRICES ACROSS 
BRITAIN OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
IF YOU LIVE IN THE WEST MIDLANDS 
AVERAGE HOUSE PRICE DOWN BY OVER 
NINE THOUSAND NINE THOUSAND NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND IN 
THE SUN AND THE MIRROR FOCUSING 
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SHANNON 
MATTHEWS CASE 
THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY EXPRESS 
AS WELL THE STORY ABOUT MADELEINE 
SAYING THE POLICE WANT THE PARENTS 
HER PARENTS TO GO BACK TO PORTUGAL 
FOR A RECONSTRUCTION 
AND THE GUARDIAN SAYS THERE'S A 
WARNING FROM A TOP OFFICIAL WITH 
THE UN THAT RISING FOOD PRICES 
COULD SPARK WORLDWIDE UNREST AND 
THREATEN POLITICAL STABILITY WE 
COULD SEE HUNGER RIOTS 
WE'VE SEEN ONE OR TWO ALREADY IN 
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD THERE 
COULD BE MORE 
AND THIS IS MOHAMED AL FAYED SAYING 
HE WILL END HIS FIGHT TO PROVE 
DIANA AND DODI WERE MURDERED 
THESE ARE THE MAIN STORIES THIS 
MORNING MORNING THE MOTHER OF SHANNON MATTHEWS WILL 
APPEAR IN COURT TODAY ACCUSED OF 
PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE 
AND CHILD NEGLECT 
THIRTY NINE THOUSAND N. H. S. STAFF SAY THEY'VE FACED 
ABUSE OF SOME KIND IN THE LAST YEAR 
WHAT'S COMING UP TODAY FANNING THE 
FLAME OF CONTROVERSY SHOULD THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH CONTINUE ON ITS 
GLOBAL TOUR AFTER THOSE PROTESTS IN 
LONDON AND PARIS 
NOW THE WEATHER 
NOW THE WEATHER GOOD MORNING IT IS COLD THIS 
MORNING AGAIN IN SOME RURAL PARTS 
OF OXFORDSHIRE AND DEVON THE 
TEMPERATURE IS CURRENTLY RESTING AT 
MINUS THREE OR MINUS FOUR DEGREES 
CELSIUS IT'S HARDLY SURPRISING TO 
HEAR THAT FOR SOME PARTS OF THE 
SOUTH IN PARTICULAR WE'RE LOOKING 
AT SOME FROST AND MAYBE ICY PATCHES 
ON UNTREATED SURFACES FOR MANY 
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THE FORECAST 
IS ONE OF SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS THE 
RADAR PICTURE GOES BACK ABOUT TWELVE 
HOURS WE'VE HAD SOME SHOWERS 
ACROSS THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND AND 
THE STATUS QUO MORE OR LESS 
PREVAILS THROUGH THE DAY BY NINE HUNDRED 
THIS MORNING AGAIN ACROSS SCOTLAND 
QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD BREAKS IN 
SUNSHINE BUT IN THE NORTH EAST WE 
HAVE THE RAIN AND SNOW TO HIGHER 
GROUND GROUND SHOWERS ACROSS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
AND SOUTHERN SCOTLAND AND ALSO 
ABOUT LINCOLNSHIRE TOO SOUTH OF

EASTERN ENGLAND ESPECIALLY EAST 
ANGLIA AND THE POSSIBLY THE SOUTH 
EAST AS WELL TEMPERATURES A LITTLE

AS WE WENT THROUGH THIS EVENING AND 
TONIGHT MANY DYING AWAY BUT A BAND 
OF RAIN IS SWEEPING ACROSS NORTHERN 
IRELAND WEST OF SCOTLAND 
IT WILL BE A COLD NIGHT WITH A 
TOUCH OF FROST AROUND AND WITH SOME 
LOCAL MIST PATCHES BUT THEY'LL 
CLEAR READILY IN THE MORNING AND 
WHERE CLOUD HAS BROKEN WE'RE 
LOOKING AT LOVELY BLUE SKIES YOU 
CAN SEE THE SHOWERY ELEMENT COMING 
IN FROM THE WEST THAT WILL BE 
PUSHING EASTWARDS THROUGH THE DAY 
TEMPERATURES TOMORROW IF ANYTHING 
UP A DEGREE OR TWO TONNE TODAY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IT'S A WAY OF LIFE THAT HASN'T 
CHANGED MUCH FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
MEMBERS OF THE SAMMY PEOPLE FROM 
NORTHERN SCANDINAVIAN SPEND THE 
SPRING AND SUMMER MONTHS HERDING 
THEIR REINDEER ACROSS THE 
LANDSCAPES AS THEIR ANCESTORS DID 
A V. PROGRAMME SPENT A YEAR WITH 
ONE FAMILY OF REINDEER FAMILIES 
ACROSS NORWAY 
WE'LL SPEAK TO TWO IN A MOMENT 
FIRST HERE IS A TASTE OF THE 
PROGRAMME 
REINDEER AT HOME IN FREEZING 
TEMPERATURES TEMPERATURES ICE AND SNOW 
EVERY YEAR THEY MAKE A SPECTACULAR 
MIGRATION FOR CENTURIES THEY'VE 
BEEN JOINED ON THESE EPIC TREKS BY 
THE SAMMY 
THE SAM SAMI ARE REINDEER HERDERS 
OF EUROPE'S FAR NORTH ONE OF THE 
CONTINENT'S LAST NOMADIC PEOPLES 
AN ANCIENT AND DEMANDING WAY OF 
LIFE THAT STILL SURVIVORS IN THE 
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
BUT MODERN SAMI HAVE MORE CHOICE 
THAN ANY GENERATION BEFORE THE 
BRIGHT LIGHTS OF OSLO MOST SEEM 
TEMPTING COMPARED TO THIS 
WILDERNESS OF ICE AND SNOW 
WHILE THE SAMI CULTURE IS CHANGING 
IT'S NOT DYING OUT AS WE CAN SEE 
WE HAVE ONE OF THE YOUNGER 
GENERATION KEEN TO KEEP THE 
TRADITION ALIVE HERE AS WELL AS HER 
MOTHER MOTHER YOU LOOK SPLENDID IN YOUR COSTUMES 
THIS IS YOUR CEREMONIAL COSTUME 
IT'S A COSTUME WHEN YOU WANT TO 
LOOK NICE 
WHEN YOU'RE OUT WITH THE 
REINDEER YOU WEAR SOMETHING MORE 
WE MOVE WITH THE REINDEER BUT NOW 
WE MOVE WITH SNOW SCOOTERS SO IT'S 
EASIER 
HOW 
MUCH IT CHANGED AND HOW EASIER MUCH NOT CHANGED 
WE I THINK WHAT 
WE FOUND THAT WAS EXCITING WAS WE 
FOUND A CULTURE THAT WAS NOT A 
POSTCARD 
IT'S CAN CULTURE VERY POSTCARD MUCH ALIVE AND PLUGGED INTO MODERN 
EUROPE AND USING PARTS THAT SUITS 
IT BUT KEEPING FIRMLY TO THE 
ANCIENT TRADITIONS AS WELL YOU 
HAVE THE SCOOTERS WHICH WILL HELP 
YOU A LOT BUT THE BASIC OPERATION 
IS PRESUMABLY THE SAME 
OTHER 
WE LIVE IN A SAMI TENT 
A TYPICALLY 
COLD I IMAGINE 
YOU GET USED IT 
AND THE REINDEER ARE USED FOR MEAT 
YES 
YOU SELL THEM AT A MARKET OR YES HOW DOES IT WORK 
YOU CHOOSE WHICH 
KIND OF ANIMAL REINDEER YOU WANT 
TO SLAUGHTER AND THEN YOU HAVE THE 
SLAUGHTER IN THE FARM THAT BY THE 
REINDEER 
THEY ARE SLAUGHTERED IN A REINDEER SLAUGHTERHOUSE IN THE TOWN YES YES PEOPLE ARE STILL MAKING MONEY OUT 
OF IT HOW DO THEY DO IT 
THE HIDES 
OF IT HOW DO THEY DO IT THE HIDES CARRY QUITE PREMIUM EVEN THE 
ANTLERS WE SELL BUT I THINK THE 
MEAT IS THE MAIN PRODUCT 
YES AND 
THEN YOU USE ALL THE PARTS OF THE 
RANGES YOU MAKE CLOTHES YOU MAKE 
THE TRADITIONAL REINDEER COAT AND 
THEN YOU MAKE THE SHOES 
AND HAVE 
YOU NOTICED BIG CHANGES IN THE 
CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT AND THINGS 
LIKE THAT DIFFERENCES FROM GLOBAL 
WARMING 
NO I DON'T LAST SPRING WARMING WHEN WE WENT ON THE MIGRATION BUT 
THERE WAS SO COLD IT WAS SO COLD 
IN ALL THE YEARS WITH THE REINDEER 
IT HAS NOT BEEN SO COLD AS SPRING SO 
I HOPE 
THAT 
THIS SPRING 
IS GOING TO BE GOOD 
THANK YOU BOTH 
VERY MUCH INDEED AND JOHN YOUR 
PROGRAMME IS ON B. B. C. TWO TONIGHT EIGHT 
O'CLOCK THANK YOU 
LET'S CATCH UP ON SOME BUSINESS 
NEWS NEWS WE ARE GOING TO TALK A LOT TODAY 
ABOUT WOMEN DID WOMEN BEING THEIR 
OWN BOSS BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW 
CAMPAIGN TO ENCOURAGE WOMEN 
ENTREPRENEURS THE GOVERNORS AS THE 
ECONOMY WOULD BE TWO PER CENT RICHER IF WE 
HAD 
AS MANY 
WOMEN STARTING UP IN 
THEIR OWN BUSINESS HERE 
AS THEY 
DO 
IN THE 
UNITED STATES WE HAVE BEEN 
TALKING TO 
ONE FEMALE 
ENTREPRENEUR 
TO FIND OUT HOW SHE TURNED HER BABY 
BAD BUSINESS FROM A SMALL OPERATION 
IN HER FRONT ROOM INTO A 
MULTINATIONAL VENTURE 
MY NAME IS MELANIE MARSHALL AND I'M 
THE CO FOUNDER OF STORKSAK WITH 
SUSIE BECHMANN WE SET UP BOTH 
HAVING YOUNG CHILDREN AND WANTING 
TO RRY ON A PROFESSIONAL WORKING 
LIVES AS SMALL BUSINESS WE 
DECIDED TO KEEP OUR COSTS VERY 
VERY LOW AND 
SET UP 
WORKING FROM 
HOME FOR 
THE FIRST 
COUPLE OF YEARS 
WE 
HAD A 
GOOD 
SOLID BUSINESS 
PLAN 
AND WE WERE 
LUCKY ENOUGH 
TO GET 
VOTES OF CONFIDENCE FROM TWO QUITE 
MAJOR DEPARTMENT STORES WHICH I 
THINK HELP US GET A D. T. I. BACKED LOAN 
THE MAIN BARRIER OF BEING A WOMAN 
WITH CHILDREN IS REALLY HOW YOU GO 
ABOUT WORKING IT AROUND THE 
CHILDREN WHICH I THINK IS 
EXTREMELY DOOR BALL AS LONG AS IT 
IS WELL ORGANISED THINK THEY ARE 
LESS FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS THAN MALE 
ENTREPRENEURS BECAUSE A LOT OF 
WOMEN THAT WORKING BEFORE AND 
HAVE CHILDREN CAN FEEL QUITE 
ISOLATED AND FEEL QUITE DESPERATE 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE GONE FROM HAVING 
A BUSINESS AND A CAREER AND THEN 
SUDDENLY THEY HAVE CHOICE 
THEY 
EITHER 
HAVE TO 
WORK THE SAME HOURS 
THAT THEY WERE WORKING BEFORE 
WHICH SOMETIMES IS UNMANAGEABLE OR 
NOTHING SO I THINK A LOT OF WOMEN 
GIVE UP ON THEIR CAREERS FOR NUMBER 
OF YEARS 
AND 
THEN I 
THINK 
IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO DRUM UP 
THAT CONFIDENCE AND ALSO TO SORT OF 
MAINTAIN THE THREAD WITHIN YOUR 
INDUSTRY IF YOU HAVE BEEN OUT OF IT 
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME 
I WILL TAKE SOME MORE ON THIS IN AN 
HOUR WE WILL TALK TO SOME PEOPLE 
FROM DRAGONS' DEN ABOUT 
HOW YOU 
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SET UP A 
BUSINESS BUSINESS HE IS AN AWARD WINNING HOLLYWOOD

BRIGHTEST THAT SORT OF DESCRIBED 
MYSELF IN THE FILM

A GUY MAKING A PLAY IS A GUY WHO 
DOESN'T MAKE A PLAY 
WE HAVE SEEN SORT OF EVERY SCENARIO 
POSSIBLE YOU KNOW HOW THEY ARE 
GOING TO END SO YOU WANT A 
DIFFERENT VENUE THIS WAS A WORLD I

INTERVIEW MEN WOMEN MALE FEMALE 
YOUNG OLD EVERYBODY WANTS TO BEAT 
GEORGE CLOONEY 
HER UNTIL THEY DO 
HOW DO COPE WITH THAT EVERY DAY 
THERE IS A CERTAIN LEVEL OF 
CELEBRITY THAT NOWADAYS IS MORE 
THAN IT USED TO DO IT IS SORT OF 
OVERWHELMING THERE IS A SORT OF A 
LACK OF A SHELL OF PRIVACY SO YOU 
HAVE TO TAKE THAT AND USE 
IT IN 
PLACES WHERE IT ACTUALLY CAN BE 
EFFECTIVE AS OPPOSED TO WHINING 
ABOUT HOW MISERABLE LIFE IS 
PICTURE RAP ON THE PHONE

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT THE QUEEN 
ELIZABETH HOSPITAL IN GATESHEAD A 
REALLY BUSY NIGHT AND WITHIN A 
MATTER OF HOURS I WITNESSED TWO 
SEPARATE ATTACKS THE FIRST WAS 
PRETTY MINOR I SUPPOSE IN THE 
GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS ALTHOUGH 
STILL UNPLEASANT IT WAS AN 
INCIDENT OF A DRUNKEN WOMAN WHO WAS 
SWEARING AND BECAME QUITE ABUSIVE 
THE SECOND INCIDENT THOUGH WAS 
FAR MORE SERIOUS THIS WAS A SECOND 
DRUNKEN WOMAN BUT THIS TIME THE 
WOMAN BECAME VERY AGGRESSIVE 
THE UNION UNISON DESCRIBES THE 
FIGURES THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED 
TODAY AS DEEPLY DEPRESSING ONE 
TWENTY SIX THOUSAND MEMBERS OF STAFF RESPONDED 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT SAID THEY HAD SUFFERED SOME 
FORM OF ABUSE AT WORK THIRTEEN PER CENT OF THOSE 
WHO RESPONDED SAID THAT ABUSE HAD 
BEEN A PHYSICAL ATTACK 
IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO DISCOVER 
THAT JUST SIXTY SIX PER CENT OF THOSE WENT ON TO 
REPORT THE ATTACK 
I SPOKE TO DOCTOR REUBEN A SENIOR 
REGISTRAR HERE AT THE HOSPITAL HE 
DESCRIBED TO ME AN ATTACK WHERE HE 
WAS PUNCHED IN THE FACE 
WE WOKE THIS CHAP UP AND HE SEEMED 
DISORIENTATED INITIALLY THEN 
BASICALLY GOT VERY VERY 
AGGRESSIVE AND STARTED SMASHING THE 
WALLS SMASHING THE EQUIPMENT 
EVENTUALLY WITH RATHER WILD 
LOOKING EYES TOOK A SWING AT ME 
IT WASN'T SOMETHING I WAS READY FOR 
IT WASN'T SOMETHING I WAS EXPECTING 
THE GOVERNMENT IS INVESTING NINETY SEVEN 
MILLION THAT WAS ANNOUNCED LAST 
SEPTEMBER THAT IS PURELY TO TRY TO 
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS SO 
THE MONEY IS GOING TO BE SPENT ON 
THINGS LIKE PERSONAL ATTACK ALARMS 
FOR MEMBERS OF STAFF THAT MONEY 
WAS ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER THIS 
SURVEY OUT TODAY WAS CONDUCTED IN 
OCTOBER SO OF COURSE THERE 
HASN'T REALLY BEEN TIME FOR THAT 
MONEY TO FILTER DOWN NEXT YEAR'S 
N. H. S. STAFF SURVEY SHOULD MAKE 
INTERESTING READING TO SEE WHETHER 
OR NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S EXTRA 
INVESTMENT HAS MADE ANY DIFFERENCE 
IN THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS 
THANK YOU 
CHINA SAYS IT EXPECTS THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH INTERNATIONAL RELAY TO 
CONTINUE DESPITE THE PROTESTS 
WHICH HAVE DISRUPTED ITS PROGRESS 
IN LONDON AND PARIS 
THERE ARE EXPECTED TO BE MORE PRO 
TIBET DEMONSTRATIONS AS IT'S 
CARRIED THROUGH SAN FRANCISCO TODAY 
MEANWHILE THERE ARE REPORTS THAT A 
SMALL GROUP OF MONKS AT A BUDDHIST 
MONASTERY IN NORTH EAST CHINA HAVE 
DEFIED AUTHORITIES AND STAGED 
PROTEST THERE IN FRONT OF FOREIGN 
REPORTERS REPORTERS LATER WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO TESSA 
SANDERSON ABOUT WHETHER THAT RELAY 
SHOULD CONTINUE 
THE BRITISH PARACHUTE REGIMENT 
ARRIVED BACK IN SOUTHERN 
AFGHANISTAN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER IT 
ENDED THE FIRST MILITARY DEPLOYMENT 
TO HELMAND PROVINCE WE CAN TALK TO 
OUR CORRESPONDENT ALISTAIR LEITHEAD 
IN SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN WITH SIXTEEN AIR 
ASSAULT BRIGADE LAST TIME THE 
PARAS WERE IN AFGHANISTAN THEY HAD 
AN EVENTFUL TIME TO PUT IT MILDLY 
THEY CERTAINLY DID L. DON'T THINK I 
WOULD BE SITTING ON THE ROOF OF 
THEIR BASE IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND SIX 
THEY HAD INTENSE FIGHTING ONE 
GENERAL SAID IT WAS MORE INTENSE 
THAN ANY BRITISH UNIT HAD BEEN 
INVOLVED IN SINCE THE KOREAN WAR 
THEY WERE BEING ATTACKED DAY AND 
NIGHT BY TALEBAN FIGHTERS WHO WERE 
TAKING THEM ON IN CONVENTIONAL 
WARFARE THEY WERE ATTACKING THEM 
IN THEIR HUNDREDS AT ONE POINT 
AFGHANISTAN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF 
YEARS HAS VERY MUCH CHANGED SINCE 
THEY CAME OUT HERE THEY'VE GONE 
MUCH MORE FROM BEING ON THE 
DEFENSIVE AS THEY WERE THEN THERE 
ARE ONLY A QUARTER OF THE TROOPS 
THERE ARE NOW IN THESE SMALL BASES 
GETTING SUPPLIES TO THEM IS VERY 
DIFFICULT NOW THE FORCES HERE ARE 
VERY MUCH ON THE OFFENSIVE THE 
BRIGADES HAVE GRADUALLY SPREAD OUT 
THEY HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF FORWARD 
BASES IN THE LUSH GREEN AREAS WHICH 
IS WHERE THE TALEBAN REALLY HAVE 
CONTROL AND THEY'VE PUSHED OUT AND 
MADE THEIR PRESENCE FELT SO THE 
PARAS UNIT WE'RE WITH HAVE COME 
BACK WITH PROBABLY A DIFFERENT 
BATTLE OR THEIR HANDS LESS LIKELY 
TO FACE THAT STAND UP HAND TO HAND 
BATTLE THEY DID THEN AND NOW AT 
MUCH MORE RISK OF BEING HIT BY A 
SUICIDE BOMB OR A BOMB LEFT AT THE 
SIDE OF THE ROAD SOMETHING THEY 
CAN'T EXPECT THAT MAKES THE 
SOLDIERS HEARING I HAVE MORE 
DIFFICULT IT OBVIOUSLY IF THEY 
HAVE AN ENEMY THEY CAN SEE IT FITS 
IN MORE WITH THE TRAINING THEY'VE 
HAD HAD MOHAMED AL FAYED SAYS HE WILL 
ABANDON HIS TEN YEAR LEGAL BATTLE 
TO PROVE HIS BELIEF THAT HIS SON 
AND DIANA PINCESS OF WALES WERE 
MURDERED EARLIER THIS WEEK AN 
INQUEST RULED THAT DIANA AND DODI 
FAYED WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED DUE TO 
THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF THE DRIVER 
HENRI PAUL AND THE PAPARAZZI 
PHOTOGRAPHERS CHASING THEM 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH FOR THE SAKE OF 
THE TWO PRINCES WHOM I KNOW THEY 
LOVE THEIR MOTHER AND HOW CLOSE 
THEY'VE BEEN L. SAW THEM DURING THE 
HOLIDAY I'M SURE THEY ARE BLESSING 
IN THEIR DEEP HEART WHAT I AM DOING 
TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH 
BUT AS I SAY I HAVE ENOUGH I'M 
LEAVING THE REST FOR GOD TO GET MY 
REVENGE REVENGE I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING ANY MORE 
MOHAMED AL FAYED 
TWO CHARITIES WILL BEGIN LEGAL 
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT 
TODAY IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE A NEW 
APPROACH TOWARDS THE PROBLEM OF 
FUEL POVERTY THREE MILLION 
HOUSEHOLDS ARE EXPECTED TO 
EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES PAYING FUEL 
BILLS IN ENGLAND ALONE THIS YEAR 
CAMPAIGNERS SAY THE GOVERNMENT IS 
IN DANGER OF MISSING ITS TARGETS OF 
ERADICATING THE PROBLEM FOR 
VULNERABLE FAMILIES WHAT DOES FUEL 
POVERTY MEAN TWO ROSINA A SEVENTY TWO YEAR 
OLD IN BRISTOL IT MEANS CHOOSING 
FOOD OVER HEAT IT MEANS CAREFULLY 
RATIONING THE CENTRAL HEATING AND 
GOING TO BED EARLY WHEN IT GETS TOO 
COLD 
IT IS WORRYING IT'S THE COLD BIGGEST WORRY BECAUSE THE PRICES GO 
UP AND YOU THINK OH I BETTER NOT 
PUT IT ON 
MANY VULNERABLE PEOPLE ARE IN THE 
SAME POSITION THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN 
ADVISORY GROUP ON ENERGY SAYS THAT 
THIS YEAR FUEL POVERTY COULD REACH 
ITS HIGHEST LEVEL FOR DECADE 
BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TARGET TO 
TAKE ALL VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN 
ENGLAND OUT OF FUEL POVERTY BY TWO THOUSAND TEN 
AND TO ERADICATE FUEL POVERTY 
ACROSS THE U. K. BY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN 
IT WILL BE TOUGH AND TODAY FRIENDS 
OF THE EARTH AND HELP THE AGED WILL 
FILE PAPERS WITH THE HIGH COURT IN 
AN ATTEMPT TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT 
TO RAMP UP ITS EFFORTS TO END FUEL 
POVERTY 
THE GOVERNMENT MISSED THE POVERTY OPPORTUNITY TO DO ANYTHING IN THE 
COMPREHENSIVE SPENDING REVIEW IT 
MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE 
BUDGET WHICH WE HAD LAST MONTH 
AND SO NOW IT SEEMS TO US THAT A 
JUDICIAL REVIEW IN THE HIGH COURT 
IS AN APPROPRIATE TOOL AN 
APPROPRIATE WEAPON TO PUT INTO THE 
EQUATION EQUATION THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS IT HAS A 
STRONG SET OF MEASURES IN PLACE TO 
TACKLE FUEL POVERTY INCLUDING THE 
WARM FRONT SCHEME AND WINTER FUEL 
PAYMENTS WHICH WERE GIVEN BOOST 
IN THE BUDGET BUT IT'S FACING THE 
HEAT AS PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO MEET 
THE COSTS OF THE COLD 
POLICE CONFISCATED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PINTS OF 
ALCOHOLIC DRINKS DURING CRACKDOWN 
ON UNDERAGE DRINKING IN FEBRUARY 
THE HAUL MAINLY BEER AND CIDER 
WAS SEIZED DURING A TWO WEEK 
OPERATION INVOLVING THIRTY NINE FORCES IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES THE ALCOHOL WAS 
CONFISCATED FROM MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND 
YOUNG PEOPLE SOME OF THEM WERE 
DRINKING BY THEMSELVES MOST WERE 
IN GROUPS THOSE ARE THE MAIN 
STORIES THIS MORNINGTURNING OUR 
ATTENTION TO THE BIG DEBATE THIS 
WEEK THE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY IT 
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE COLOURFUL 
ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE BEIJING GAMES 
BUT PRO TIBETAN DEMONSTRATIONS IN 
LONDON AND PARIS HAVE LEFT MANY 
PEOPLE ASKING IF THE FLAME SHOULD 
BE EXTINCT WISHED THIS MORNING THE 
CHINESE AUTHORITIES HAVE VOWED THE 
TORCH WILL VISIT TIBET AS PART OF 
ITS TWENTY COUNTRY TOUR DO THE 
PROTESTS MAKE A MOCKERY OF THE 
OLYMPIC IDEAL LET'S TALK TO THE 
OLYMPIC GOLD MED LIST TESSA 
SANDERSON WHO CARRIED THE TORCH 
DURING THE LONDON PART AND MIKE 
WALTERS TESSA SHOULD THIS CARRY 
ON 
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF ON PROTESTERS A LOT OF BLOOD THAT'S 
GOING ON PEOPLE THROWING 
THEMSELVES UNDER BUSES AND 
EVERYTHING LIKE THAT PHYSICAL 
VIOLENCE THEN NO L. THINK THE I. O. C. 
SHOULD THEN SAY THIS ISN'T PART OF 
THE OLYMPIC IDEAL THEY DON'T WANT 
IT AND FORGET IT THE THING IS IF 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWAY FROM A LOT 
OF THE FANTASTIC THINGS IT'S DOING 
LIKE IN STRATFORD FOR INSTANCE I 
RAN THERE ON SUNDAY AND TWENTY THOUSAND 
TURNED OUT WE HARDLY SAW ANYTHING 
ON AIR OF THAT APART FROM THE 
VIOLENCE THAT IS REALLY SAD IF 
IT'S GOING TO BE THE WAY IT WAS 
WITH SECURITY ENCASEING YOU TRYING 
TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAD SO MANY 
BOYS IN BLUE MAKING YOU FEEL LIKE 
THIS IF IT'S CARRYING ON LIKE THAT 
AND IT'S DOING BAD THERE YOU'RE 
SHOWING THAT THAT'S GETTING 
TIRESOME TOO 
WHEN YOU SAY THE 
BOYS IN BLUE DO YOU MEAN THE 
CHINESE SECURITY GUYS OR THE 
POLICE 
I MEANT THE CHINESE POLICE SECURITY GUYS WE UNDERSTAND THEY 
HAD TO HAVE SECURITY BUT I REALLY 
DO THINK THAT OUR GUYS COULD HAVE 
DONE JUST AS GOOD A JOB IT WAS 
JUST A LITTLE TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT 
MIKE THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES SEEM 
DETERMINED THIS IS GOING TO GO 
AHEAD EVEN INTO TIBET WHAT DO YOU 
THINK DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE 
RIGHT WAY TO DO THINGS 
THERE'S AN 
ANCIENT CHINESE PROVERB WHICH SAYS 
CALL OFF THIS FARCE NOW IT'S DOING 
MORE HARM THAN GOOD THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH IS A SYMBOL OF UNITY OF 
PEACE THE OLYMPIC IDEALS FOR 
WHICH PEOPLE LIKE TESSA HAVE DONE 
SO MUCH SERVICE IN BYGONE YEARS IF 
YOU DON'T WANT TO BECOME BITTEN BY 
A DOG DON'T BECOME A POSTMAN IT'S 
THAT SIMPLE 
IF THERE WAS A 
MISCALCULATION MADE WHERE WAS IT 
DO YOU THINK 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
THINKING THE GAMES MAYBE IT 
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO CHINA 
IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S NOT FOR ME 
TO SAY BUT THIS WAS LIKE EIGHT 
NINE YEARS AGO BECAUSE WHAT HAS 
BEEN HAPPENING WITH TIBET AND CHINA 
HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND 
YEARS MAYBE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
CONSIDERED A LITTLE BIT MORE L. 
THINK PROBABLY GOING BACK AGAIN TO 
A SECURITY SIDE I THINK MAYBE 
THERE WAS TOO MUCH OF THAT WITH A 
LOT OF THE CHINESE SECURITY COMING 
SO A LOT OF THE PROTESTERS PROBABLY 
WOULD HAVE GOT RIELD AT SEEING THAT 
SO CLOSE PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING 
TESSA COME HERE OR HELLO BUT YOU 
WERE FRIGHTENED OF HOLDING UP YOUR 
HAND AND SAYING HELLO BECAUSE THEY 
WERE SAYING BACK PLEASE IT WAS 
VERY VERY DIFFICULT 
LET'S THROW 
THIS AHEAD THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENED 
NOW WHEN WE HAVE THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
IN LONDON IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE DO YOU THINK THE 
IDEA OF A RELAY SHOULD BE 
RECONSIDERED WHAT DO YOU THINK 
SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE MIKE 
FOR START I HOPE THE ORGANISING 
COMMITTEE FOR TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN LONDON HAVE 
LOOKED AT WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE 
PAST FEW DAYS AND WON'T TAKE THE 
TORCH ON A TOUR OF PLACES LIKE 
BAGHDAD BASRA OR KABUL PLACES 
WHERE IT WON'T NECESSARILY BE 
WELCOMED IT SHOULDN'T BE A FOCAL 
POINT FOR ANTI BRITISH 
DEMONSTRATIONS DEMONSTRATIONS BUT THE TOUR IS PART OF THE OLYMPIC 
IDEAL HAD WE SHOWN WHAT HAD 
HAPPENED IN STRATFORD THEY DID 
FANTASTIC OVER THERE JUST TO SHOW 
THE POSITIVE SIDE OF WHAT THE TORCH 
DID I LIT THE TORCH FROM THE FIRST 
ATHLETE INDUCTED INTO THE ACADEMY 
AND IT WAS MARVELLOUS TO SEE HIS 
FACE THERE ARE GOOD POINTS AND AND THE MESSAGE HAS POSSIBLY BEEN LOST 
IN THE WIDER CONTROVERSY YEAH YEAH I JUST THINK THAT THE OLYMPICS IS 
ABOUT BRINGING UNITY AND BRINGING 
PEOPLE TOGETHER 
THANK YOU BOTH 
STILL TO COME TIM MUFFETT IS 
ASKING IF FLOWERS OF FOUR BY FOURS TAKE 
PRIORITY IN YOUR GARDEN 
TO PAVE OR NOT TO PAVE THAT IS THE 
QUESTION FOR MANY HOMEOWNERS BUT 
COVERING YOUR FRONT GARDEN WITH 
CONCRETE COULD 
SHORTLY 
BECOME MUCH 
MORE COMPLICATED WILL EXPLAIN WHY WHY OH FOR THE 
LAST FEW 
YEARS THERE 
HAS BEEN 
TALK OF 
A PROPERTY 
IT 
REALLY DOES 
LOOK 
LIKE IT 
IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR 
ONE FIRST TIME BUYER TELLS 
BREAKFAST WHY WORRIES OVER HOUSE 
PRICES GAVE HIM COLD FEET 
ONE PLACE WHERE YOU WON'T FIND ANY 
CRAZY PAVING IS THE BLUE PETER 
GARDEN WITH CAROL THIS MORNING

PARTS OF WALES 
THAT RAIN BAND 
IF ANYTHING TURNING 
A BIT SHOWERY STILL ELEMENT HIGH 
GROUND ACROSS 
AND IT WILL BE EASTWARDS AHEAD OF IT 
PLENTY OF 
SUNSHINE 
ON OFFER 
AND TEMPERATURES 
AGAIN 
UP A 
DEGREE ON WHAT WE WERE 
EXPECTING TODAY 
THE OUTLOOK FOR 
THE FOLLOWING FEW DAYS REMAINS 
UNSETTLED WITH SUNSHINE AND 
THE WINTRY ELEMENT REALLY 
DIMINISHING APART FROM THE 
HILLS OF 
THE NORTH 
THAT'S HOW IT IS LOOKING 
THE DAILY MIRROR IS TALKING ABOUT 
SHANNON'S MOTHER ACCUSED OF 
PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE 
ALSO THEY 
ARE TALKING ABOUT 
HAPPENED 
LAST NIGHT IN THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
SIMILAR ON 
THE 
FRONT OF THE SUN 
THE 
OTHER PAPERS 
ARE LOOKING AT 
PROPERTY 
PRICES THIS 
IS THE 
WARNING FROM THE I. M. F. 
THAT HOUSE 
WARNING FROM THE I. M. F. THAT HOUSE PRICES 
AS 
MUCH AS TEN PER CENT HAVE 
FRONT DOORS 
FROM VARIOUS 
PARTS 
OF THE 
COUNTRY TELLING YOU 
MUCH 
A HOUSE 
PRICE 
HAS GONE 
UP OR 
DOWN IN THE SOUTH WEST DOWN THE 
AVERAGE PRICE BY 
OVER NINE THOUSAND IN 
GREATER LONDON UP BY NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND 
THE DAILY MAIL MILLIONS OF 
HOMEOWNERS ARE BEING SHORT CHANGED 
BY NOT HAVING INTEREST RATE CUTS 
BEING PASSED ON 
MADELEINE'S PARENTS THE 
PORTUGUESE POLICE WANT HER PARENTS 
TO GO BACK TO PORTUGAL FOR A 
RECONSTRUCTION 
HE MENTIONED THE I. M. F. IT IS THE 
WORLD'S LEADING ECONOMIC BODY WHAT 
IT SAYS CARRIES 
A LOT 
OF WEIGHT IT 
IS TALKING ABOUT THREE EFFECTIVELY 
DIFFERENT THINGS 
OVER THE 
LAST TWENTY FOUR 
HOURS 
OR SO 
IT IS 
TALKING FIRST 
ALL 
ABOUT HOW 
MUCH 
THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH THE 
SQUEEZE 
ON LENDING 
BETWEEN BANKS 
IS GOING 
TO COST IT 
RECKONS THAT 
IS GOING 
TO BE ONE 
TRILLION U. S. DOLLARS IT BEEN 
TAKING A 
LOOK 
AT WHAT 
HAPPENED 
WITH THE 
MAJOR ECONOMIES 
AROUND THE 
WORLD THIS 
IS WHAT IT 
HAS TO 
SAY ABOUT 
US ASIDE 
FROM 
THAT 
WARNING THAT 
PROPERTY PRICES 
MAY FALL 
IT ALSO 
SAYS THAT 
WE ARE 
GOING TO HAVE THE 
SLOWEST GROWTH 
OVER TWO 
YEARS SINCE 
THE END 
OF THE 
LAST 
RECESSION THAT 
MEANS 
ECONOMY 
WILL STILL 
EXPAND BUT 
IT 
WILL ONLY GROW BY ABOUT 
ONE POINT FIVE PER CENT 
WHICH 
IS QUITE 
A BIT 
BELOW WHAT THE 
GOVERNMENT 
HAD FORECAST 
BUT IT 
AND 
WE SHOULD 
POINT THIS 
OUT FOR 
THE SAKE 
OF VENICE 
THAT STILL 
MEANS WE 
ARE GROWING 
FASTER THAN 
GERMANY IT 
STILL MEANS 
WE ARE 
GROWING FASTER 
THAN 
THE EUROPEAN 
AVERAGE AS 
WELL 
SO A 
LOT OF 
COMMENTARY FROM THE I. M. F. 
TODAY THAT 
WILL BE CONFIRMED AFTER LUNCHTIME 
BUT THE 
FORECAST IS 
THAT THE 
ECONOMY IS SLOWING 
DOWN WE 
ARE 
GOING TO GROW 
AS FAST 
AS HAD 
BEEN 
EXPECTED BUT WE 
ARE STILL GOING 
EXPAND NOT 
GOING TO 
GROW AS FAST 
AS EXPECTED 
HERE IS A PROBLEM WHERE TO PARK 
THE CAR IF 
YOU LIVE 
IN A TOWN OR 
THE SUBURBS 
ONE 
SOLUTION TO 
PARKING 
PROBLEMS FOR 
MANY 
PARKING PROBLEMS FOR MANY HOME OWNERS 
IS TO 
GREENERY 
PAVE IT OVER BUT 
FEARS 
THAT THIS 
INCREASES THE 
RISK 
OF FLOODING 
THAT THINGS 
ARE ABOUT 
CHANGE FOR 
THOSE PLANNING 
TO 
POUR CONCRETE 
OVER THEIR 
CHRYSANTHEMUMS 
MUFFETT IS IN HOVE TO EXPLAIN 
TIM WHEWELL NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOURS 
JANE AND SARAH JANE HAS HER FRONT 
GARDEN PAVED OVER IT IS GREAT 
PARKING THE CAR 
IT DONE TO HER FRONT GARDEN 
SHE DOES 
IT QUITE SHORTLY 
BECOME A LOT MORE COMPLICATED 
WHEN THERE IS A 
FLOOD DISRUPTION 
AND MISERY ARE SURE TO 
FOLLOW BUT 
ARE THEY 
BEYOND OUR 
CONTROL OR 
HAVE 
OUR ACTIONS 
ACTUALLY MAKE THEM 
MORE LIKELY PAVED OVER GARDENS 
ARE AN 
INCREASINGLY POPULAR 
CHOICE FOR 
MANY IT 
CAN BE 
CONVENIENT PLACE TO PARK YOUR BUT 
WHEREAS GRASS 
OR SOIL 
IS GOOD 
AT ABSORBING WATER PAVING ASH 
FAULT OR CONCRETE IS NOT IN IT 
CAN INCREASE 
THE AMOUNT OF WATER 
WHICH RUNS 
OF BY 
UP TO 
FIFTY 
PER CENT IF 
IT 
IS JUST 
ONE GARDEN 
THAT 
IS NOT 
A 
PROBLEM BUT 
IF MANY 
GARDENS IN 
ONE 
STREET HAVE BEEN WATER 
USUALLY 
INTO A 
DRAIN BUT SOMETIMES 
TRAINS CAN'T 
COPE SO 
IN 
PAVING 
YOUR FRONT 
GARDEN 
IS SET 
TO 
GET 
HARDER LATER THIS YEAR FOR 
THE 
FIRST TIME 
YOU WILL NEED 
PLANNING PERMISSION 
THE 
PLANNING PERMISSION THE ONLY EXCEPTION WILL 
BE SPECIALLY 
EXCEPTION WILL BE SPECIALLY DESIGNED POROUS PAVING OR GRAVEL 
A. N. N. HAS JUST HAD HER FRONT GARDEN 
PAVED OVER 
I THINK THE PARKING GRADUALLY GOT 
WORSE OVER THE 
LAST 
YEAR AND 
THAT MADE 
ME MAKE 
MY MIND 
UP 
BY GETTING IT DONE 
NOW SHE 
UP AVOIDED 
THE PLANNING 
PERMISSION 
THAT OTHERS WILL SOON 
NEED IT 
IT MIGHT STOP SOME PEOPLE GOING 
DOING IT THERE IS 
PROBABLY A LOT 
OF PEOPLE 
WHO CAN'T 
BE BOTHERED 
WITH THE 
HASSLE YOU 
START DOING 
A 
FEW THINGS 
YOU 
HIT A 
FEW BARRIERS 
A BIT OF 
RED TAPE 
AND YOU 
THINK I 
WOULD JUST 
LEAVE IT THE 
WOULD JUST LEAVE IT THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 
HAVE BEEN 
HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY HAVE BEEN CALLING 
FOR TOUGHER 
REGULATIONS FOR 
YEARS THEY 
ARE 
NEW RULES 
IT IS THE FIRST 
LEGISLATION THAT ACTUALLY 
LINKS TO 
FRONT GARDENS AND GIVES 
PROPER PROTECTION THE 
THINGS 
PROPER PROTECTION THE THINGS BEFORE 
HAVE BEEN RATHER 
PERIPHERAL 
AND OPEN 
TO INTERPRETATION 
SO 
BESET SIT DOWN 
AND SAYS WE CAN 
PROTECT FRONT GARDENS AT LEAST 
ON BEING SOLIDLY CONCRETED OVER 
THE SOCIETY 
BELIEVES THAT 
DETERMINED TO TRANSFORM THEIR 
DETERMINED TO TRANSFORM THEIR FRONT GARDEN SHOULD AT LEAST GRAVEL LIKE THE OWNER 
OF THIS 
DRIVEWAY SO 
THEY HAVE 
USED GRAVEL HERE 
HAVEN'T THEY 
THEY 
HAVE THAT IS 
HAVEN'T THEY THEY HAVE THAT IS GREAT 
THERE ARE 
PLENTY OF GAPS 
BETWEEN THE GRAVEL AND 
ALLOWED 
THE WATER 
THROUGH INTO THE 
GROUND BELOW 
FLOODS ARE IMPOSSIBLE 
TO STOP ALTOGETHER BUT MANY 
BELIEVE THEY WILL 
BE LESS LIKELY 
IF 
BELIEVE THEY WILL BE LESS LIKELY IF THERE ARE FEWER OF THESE 
WELL SARAH YOUR GRASS 
LOOKS VERY 
GREEN AT THE 
MOMENT DO 
YOU THINK 
YOU'RE GOING 
TO GO 
AHEAD AND GET 
IT 
TRANSFORMED INTO A DRIVEWAY YES YES PROBABLY BUT WE ARE LOOKING INTO 
MORE ALTERNATIVES 
TO PAVEY WHAT IS 
ALTERNATIVES TO PAVEY WHAT IS THE MAIN REASON 
FOR YOU 
TO GO AHEAD 
BECAUSE THE 
COUNCIL ARE 
THINKING OF 
BRINGING IN 
A PARKING 
SCHEME AND 
WILL NOT 
BE ABLE 
TO PARK 
IN 
OF THAT REALLY IS A 
KEY ISSUE 
HERE IS 
ONE IMPORTANT 
FACTOR 
THE FLOODS 
LAST YEAR 
IT IS ESTIMATED 
TWO THIRDS OF THE 
HOUSES WHICH 
OF 
SURFACE WATER RUNNING OFF THE 
DAMAGE OF 
COURSE RUN INTO BILLIONS 
AND 
BILLIONS OF POUNDS 
AROUND THREE 
BILLION 
IN FACT THE NORWICH 
UNION 
THE U. K.'S LARGEST INSURER ALSO SAYS 
TODAY 
THAT MOST HOUSEHOLDS 
AFFECTED 
BY THE FLOODS 
HAVE NOT 
DONE ENOUGH 
TO PROTECT 
THEIR 
THEY 
SAY PEOPLE 
SHOULD BE SEEING 
THEIR WINDOWS 
AND THE 
DOORS 
MAY BE 
INSTALLING PUMPS 
I'M SURE 
INSTALLING PUMPS I'M SURE MANY PEOPLE WILL SAY HANG 
ON ISN'T IT 
DOWN TO THE LOCAL 
BODIES THE 
GOVERNMENT WATER 
COMPANIES TO DO 
MORE 
TO IMPROVE 
DRAINAGE 
WHO KNOWS 
WHAT THE 
REAL ANSWER 
IS ONE 
IS FOR SURE 
THOUGH IF YOU WANT 
TRANSFORM YOUR 
DRIVEWAY INTO 
PAVED AREA 
THAT PROCESS 
IS SET 
TO 
BECOME A LOT MORE DIFFICULT 
WE HAVE HAD ONE E. MAIL IN CORNWALL 
FOR PER UNA OWNERS ARE NOT 
PEOPLE TO PAVE OVER THEIR GARDENS

LOUISE AS WELL YESTERDAY ACTOR 
DIRECTOR PRODUCERS HUMANITARIAN

LOUISE LATERI WISH I SO WISH 
WHEN I MET HIM IN THE LIFT IT WAS 
ONE OF THOSE EMBARRASSING MOMENTS 
WHEN THE DOORS CLOSED ON ME BUT HE 
OPENED THEM 
WHEN I MET HIM IN THE LIFT 
SHE'LL HAVE T. SHIRT 
SORRY WHAT 
HAS THE MULTI MILLIONAIRE GOOD 
LOOKING GEORGE CLOONEY GOT WHAT 
BILL AND I HAVEN'T NOTHING LET'S NOTHING LET'S GET ON WITH THE SPORT SIX GOALS A 
CONTROVERSIAL PENALTY AND MAGICAL 
ATMOSPHERE IT'S RARE THAT 
FOOTBALL MATCH LIVES UP TO THE HYPE 
BUT LAST NIGHT LIVERPOOL AND 
ARSENAL BATTLED IT OUT FOR A PLACE 
IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI FINAL 
AND LIVERPOOL CAME OUT ON TOP THE 
SIDES COULDN'T BE SEPARATED FROM 
THE FIRST LEG THE MATCH WAS 
HEADING FOR YET ANOTHER ONE DRAW WHEN 
FERNANDO TORRES FIRED LIVERPOOL 
AHEAD BUT ARSENAL BOUNCED BACK 
THEO WALCOTT'S AMAZING RUN SET UP 
EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR AND THE GUNNERS 
APPEARED TO BE THROUGH WITH FIVE 
MINUTES LEFT THEN THIS MOMENT OF 
CONTROVERSY WAS IT A PENALTY TOUR 
TOUR WAS ADJUDGED TO HAVE FOULED 
AND STEVEN GERRARD STEPPED UP AND 
PUT LIVERPOOL AHEAD RHINE BABBLE 
ADDED A FOURTH IN THE VERY MINUTE 
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO PLAY IN 
FRONT OF OUR SUPPORTERS YOU COULD 
HEAR THEM FROM THE START OF THE 
GAME I THINK THEIR SUPPORT IS 
AMAZING MASSIVE FOR THE PLAYERS 
ALWAYS THEY DON'T GIVE UP BECAUSE 
THEY HEAR THE PEOPLE 
IT'S VERY 
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND TO ARE ME 
IT WAS NO PENALTY TONIGHT L. 
WATCHED IT CLEARLY AGAIN LAST 
WEEK IT WAS A REAL PENALTY BUT WE 
HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT AND AS WELL 
TO ACCEPT THAT IN A GAME LIKE THAT 
WHERE WE HAD SO MUCH CONTROL WE 
WERE TOO NAIVE WE LACKED A BIT OF 
MATURITY DEFENSIVELY 
CHELSEA MADE 
HARD WORK OF THEIR PROGRESS TO THE 
SEMI FINAL AGAINST FEN BATCHY THEY 
TOOK A THIRD MINUTE LEAD THROUGH 
MICHAEL BALLACK WHICH BROUGHT THE 
TIE LEVEL AND THEN MADE THE GAME 
SAFE AFTER MICHAEL ESSIEN SET UP 
FRANK LAMPARD TO SECURE A FOURTH 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI FINAL PLACE 
IN FIVE YEARS THEY WILL NOW FACE 
LIVERPOOL IN THAT SEMI FINAL 
TONIGHT MANCHESTER UNITED WILL BE 
HOPING TO MAKE IT THREE ENGLISH 
CLUBS IN THE SEMIES THEY HAVE A TWO 
ZERO WIN FROM THE FIRST LEG AGAINST 
ROMA AFTER CRISTIANO RONALDO AND 
WAYNE ROONEY SCORED IN THE AWAY TIE 
MUCH IS EXPECTED OF THIS UNITED 
SIDE BY THE WAY THEY BEAT ROMA SEVEN 
ONE WHEN THEY PLAYED AT OLD TRAFFORD 
LAST SEASON 
WE HAVE ONE FOOT IN 
THE SEMI FINAL TO GET TWO FEET IN 
THE SEMI FINAL THE BEST WAY IS TO 
APPROACH A GAME IN THE PROPER 
FASHION AND WIN IT 
WE CAN'T LOOK UPON THE PERFORMANCE 
IN ROME AS AN ABSOLUTE PASS INTO 
THE SEMI FINAL 
WE GOT THERE BECAUSE WE WORKED OUR 
SOCKS OFF BECAUSE THE TEAM 
DISCIPLINE WAS GOOD BECAUSE 
TACTICALLY THEY WERE GOOD ON THE 
NIGHT THAT'S THE KIND OF 
PERFORMANCE WE NEED 
PORTSMOUTH AREN'T BEING DISTRACTED 
BY THE F. A. CUP FINAL THEY BEAT WEST 
HAM LAST NIGHT THE CROATIAN JAMES 
CRAN'S GOAL ON THE HOUR SECURED THE 
POINTS IN WHAT WAS A REAL LOW KEY 
GAME AT UPTON PARK THAT WAS HIS 
FIFTH OF THE SEASON ANDY MURRAY IS 
OFF TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN BEIJING 
DESPITE THE FACT THE OLYMPIC FINAL 
IS JUST TEN DAYS BEFORE THE START 
OF THE U. S. OPEN THE BRITISH NUMBER 
ONE SAID IT WOULD BE HUGE HONOUR 
TO REPRESENT BRITAIN AT THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES GAMES TIGER WOODS SAYS HE HAS SET HIS 
SIGHTS ON WINNING THE MAJOR GROUND 
SLAM THIS YEAR FIRST UP IS THE 
MASTERS WHICH GETS UNDER WAY ON 
THURSDAY THURSDAY HE HAS BEEN PAIRED WITH THE 
AUSTRALIAN STUART APPLEBY FOR THE 
FIRST TWO ROUNDS WOODS HIS CHASING 
HIS FIFTH GREEN JACKET 
THIS MAJOR 
IS SO IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US 
IT'S SUCH A SPECIAL EVENT YOU 
ALWAYS WANT TO WIN THIS EVENT I'VE 
BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO WIN IT FOUR 
TIMES BUT IN ORDER TO WIN IT ALL 
ON CALENDAR YOU HAVE TO WIN HERE 
HOPEFULLY I CAN GET IT DONE THIS 
YEAR AND MOVE ON 
TALKING OF THE MASTERS L. L. WANT TO 
SHOW YOU STORY ON THE INSIDE 
PAGES OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH SPORTS 
SECTION THIS MAN HE DOESN'T LOOK 
LIKE A GOLFER HE HAS HIS 
CAMOUFLAGE TROUSERS ON HE'S BOO 
WEEKLY MORE INTERESTED IN FISHING 
AND HUNDREDING THAN GOLF BUT GOLF 
PAYS THE BILLS HE WENT TO THE 
MASTERS NORMALLY YOU SAY WOW AN 
AMAZING COURSE SOMEONE SAID WHAT 
DO YOU THINK OF AMEN CORNER WHICH 
IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PARTS 
AND HE SAID WHEREABOUTS IS THAT 
HE'S ONE OF THESE GUYS WHO DOESN'T 
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT GOLFING WHEN 
YOU ASKED ME WHERE AMEN CORNER WAS 
I SAID FIFTEENTH SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH L. L. WAS 
WRONG AND I'VE BEEN THERE NO 
EXCUSE JOHN THANK YOU FOR YOUR E. 
MAIL I'VE LOOKED IT UP IT'S THE 
ELEVENTH TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH YOU ASKED ME 
WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE IT'S 
JUST WHERE YOUR ROUND CAN DIE BUT 
IT IS DATING BACK TO NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WHEN 
ARNOLD PALMER WON THE MASTERS 
THERE WAS COMPLICATED RULING BUT 
HE BASICALLY BIRDIED HIS WAY ROUND 
THERE THERE AND THE GUY WHO NAMED IT WAS 
HERBERT WARREN 
BUT BOO IT'S GAME HEAD ISN'T IT 
DO YOU THINK IT'S LIKE I'M NOT 
GETTING EXCITED ABOUT IT 
AS SOME 
PEOPLE SAY THEY WONDER IF HE HAS A 
FISHING ROD IN HIS GOLF BAG AS HE 
GOES ACROSS THE LAKES 
IT'S A HOT TALKING POINT UP AND 
DOWN THE COUNTRY AND EVERYBODY 
SEEMS TO HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT IT 
WHETHER HOUSE PRICES ARE GOING UP 
OR DOWN AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
HALIFAX REPORTED THAT PRICES IN 
MARCH EXPERIENCED THEIR BIGGEST 
DROP IN SIXTEEN YEARS GORDON BROWN SAYS 
THE FALL OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IS CONTIM 
HENMANABLE BUT REASSURANCES LIKE 
THAT MAY NOT CONTAINABLE BUT 
REASSURANCES LIKE THAT MAY NOT BE 
ENOUGH ESPECIALLY FOR FIRST TIME 
BUYERS WE TALK TO ONE WHO HAS 
DECIDED TO PULL OUT OF HIS PURCHASE 
I'M RICHARD I'M THIRTY SIX YEARS OLD 
HAVE BEEN WAITING TO GET ON THE 
LADDER FOR THE LAST LEE OR FOUR 
YEARS I'VE FINALLY PUT IN AN OFFER 
IN JANUARY JUST BEFORE EXCHANGING 
I'VE DECIDED TO PULL OUT BECAUSE OF 
THE POSSIBLE PROPERTY CRASH COMING 
EVEN THOUGH OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS 
THERE HAS BEEN TALK OF PROPERTY 
CRASH IT REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE 
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR IT 
WAS THE PROPERTY I WAS LOOKING FOR 
HOWEVER THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF 
VERY SIMILAR PROPERTIES IN A 
SIMILAR LOCATION ON THE MARKET SO 
I THINK EVEN SIX TWELVE MONTHS DOWN 
THE ROAD I WILL BE ABLE TO GET 
SOMETHING THAT I'M HAPPY WITH L. DO 
FEEL LIKE I'VE DONE THE RIGHT 
THING I DIDN'T COME TO THE 
DECISION LIGHTLY BUT NOW I'VE MADE 
IT I'M HAPPY TO LOSE THE PROPERTY 
EVEN THOUGH I DID LIKE IT I'LL BE 
HAPPY TO RENT NOW MAINLY BECAUSE I 
COULD SEE IF I DID PURCHASE THIS 
PROPERTY I COULD END UP LOSING 
THOUSANDS OF POUNDS 
THERE'S SOMEONE WHO HAS HOPPED OUT 
OF THE MARKET TWO VERY DIFFERENT 
VIEWS OF WHAT'S GOING ON JASMINE 
BIRTHLES IS A PERSONAL FINANCE 
EXPERT AND GARY MCCAUSLAND T. V. 
PRESENT AND PROPERTY DEVELOPER 
JOINS US JAS LYNN ARE WE ALL 
DOOMED 
NOT EXACTLY BUT I THINK DOOMED HOUSE PRICES WILL CONTINUE TO COME 
DOWN FOR A WHILE IT'S A CORRECTION 
IT'S BEEN COMING FOR A WHILE YOU 
CAN'T CONTINUE TO DEFY GRAVITY AND 
HAVE PRICES JUST GOING UP AND UP 
AND UP THE WORLD BANK HAS SAID OUR 
HOUSE PRICES ARE OVERVALUED BY 
ABOUT THIRTY PER CENT L. THINK THERE IS A 
LITTLE WAY TO GO STILL 
GARY WHAT 
DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN 
I DON'T 
THINK THERE WILL BE A CRASH THE 
PRICES ARE GOING DOWN AND WE'RE AT 
THE END OF A CYCLE THAT HAS BEEN ON 
THE GO FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS WE'VE 
SEEN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY PER CENT INCREASE IN PRICES 
HOUSES PRICES ARE DIPPING BUT THE 
UNDERPINNING ECONOMICS OF THE 
MARKET IS VERY STRONG WE HAVE LOW 
INTEREST RATES WHICH WILL PROBABLY 
GO DOWN AGAIN THIS WEEK HIGH 
EMPLOYMENT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF 
DEMAND WITH LIMITED SUPPLY JASMINE JASMINE HOUSE PRICES IN SCOTLAND ARE STILL 
GOING UP 
AND LONDON AS WELL 
WHATEVER HAPPENS IT WILL BE A 
PATCHY PICTURE FOR A WHILE IT'S 
TRUE THERE ARE MANY MANY STRONG 
INDICATORS THAT IN THE LONG TERM 
PROPERTY IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO 
UP BUT I THINK THIS YEAR AND NEXT 
YEAR WE WILL SEE IT SOFTENING 
PROBABLY GOING DOWN BY I WOULD SAY 
BY AT LEAST TEN PER CENT ONE OF THE THINGS 
PUSHING PRICES UP BEFORE WAS THAT 
BANKS WERE GIVING AS MUCH MONEY AS 
YOU WANTED 
AND JUST ON THE TEN PER CENT IF 
YOU KNOCK OFF TEN PER CENT THAT'S AN 
ENORMOUS AMOUNT IT'S THOUSANDS OF 
POUNDS FOR MOST PEOPLE ISN'T IT 
ABSOLUTELY BUT WHEN YOU SEE THE 
RISES WE'VE HAD AS GARY SAID ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY PER CENT 
IT HAS GONE UP ENORMOUSLY THIS 
HANLEY BEEN SUSTAINABLE PLEETLY 
WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE COMPLETELY COMPLETELY WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE DO IN THIS 
STRANGE TIME IF YOU WANT TO SELL 
OR BUY WHAT DO YOU DO 
I THINK 
IT'S A CASE OF SITTING TIGHT THIS 
SOUNDS A BIT AN OXYMORON IT'S A 
GOOD TIME IF YOU HAVE CASH TO BUY 
PROPERTY BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT 
OF BARGAINS AND MOTIVATED SELLERS 
LONG TERM PROPERTY IS A GREAT 
INVESTMENT OVER THE LAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
PROPERTY HAS RISEN BY ON AVERAGE 
TEN PER CENT PER ANNUM IT WILL CONTINUE TO 
GO UP AS THE HUMAN RACE INCREASES 
JASMINE YOU SAID THERE WILL BE 
TEN PER CENT CORRECTION IN THE MARKET I PUT 
IT TO YOU IT COULD BE EVEN WORSE 
FOR THIS REASON WE HEARD FROM 
RICHARD THERE HE'S NOT JUMPING IN 
HE'S GETTING OUT OF THE MARKET THE 
FIRST TIME BUYERS AT THE BOTTOM 
RUNG OF THE PROPERTY LADDER IF YOU 
TAKE THAT LADDER AWAY BECAUSE THEY 
CAN'T GET MORTGAGES DON'T ALL THE 
REST OF THE RUNGS COLLAPSE AS WELL 
I AGREE WHO KNOWS WHAT IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT YEAR MAYBE 
OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS IT'S NOT 
JUST THE FIRST TIME BUYERS AT THE 
MOMENT WE'RE LOOKING VERY MUCH AT 
BUY TO LET PEOPLE WHO SUDDENLY ARE 
FINDING THAT THEIR MORTGAGES HAVE 
MASSIVELY INCREASED OR EVEN 
THEY'RE NOT BEING GIVEN NEW ONE 
BECAUSE AN AWFUL LOT OF BUY TO LET 
MORTGAGES HAVE BEEN PULLED THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE FLOODING THE MARKETS I 
WOULD EXPECT WITH HOUSES THEY 
CAN'T GET THE RENT FOR 
WHAT ABOUT 
THAT WHOLE NEGATIVE EQUITY THING 
WHICH HAPPENED WHICH REALLY 
DESTROYED MANY PEOPLE'S LIVES WHAT 
ABOUT THAT 
THIS ISN'T THE EARLY 
NINETEEN NINETIES INTEREST RATES IS NOT AT FIFTEEN PER CENT 
INFLATION IS NOT AT TEN PER CENT EMPLOYMENT 
IS NOT LOW AND CUTTING OF PUBLIC 
SPENDING WE HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY 
WE'RE IN A RARE SITUATION WHERE 
THIS CREDIT CRUNCH WAS A CURVEBALL 
TO A LOT OF US 
IN THOSE DAYS THEY 
DIDN'T HAVE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT MORTGAGES 
THAT IS 
A PROBLEM L. AGREE WITH THAT 
ANYONE WHO HAS TAKEN A ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
MORTGAGE UP OVER THE LAST SIX 
MONTHS COULD BE IN TROUBLE 
O. K. I KNOW YOU TWO ARE COMING BACK 
IF ANY VIEWERS HAVE ANY OTHER 
QUESTIONS FOR YOU THEY CAN SEND 
THANK YOU 
YOU'RE WATCHING PECK BREAKFAST 
THE MAIN STORIES 
THE MOTHER OF SHANNON MATTHEWS WILL 
APPEAR IN COURT ACCUSED OF 
PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE 
AND CHILD NEGLECT 
THIRTY NINE THOUSAND N. H. S. STAFF SAY THEY'VE FACED 
ABUSE OF SOME KIND IN THE PAST YEAR 
ALSO COMING UP 
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT COUNTING 
CARDS NO CARDS NO I'M TALKING ABOUT GETTING VERY 
VERY RICH 
JIM STUR JESS WILL BE HERE ABOUT 
TALKING ABOUT PLAYING HIS CARDS 
RIGHT IN HIS NEW FILM TWENTY ONE 
IT'S ALL ABOUT PLAYING PONTOON 
ISN'T IT IN VEGAS 
HOW MUCH OF A GAMBLE IS THE WEATHER 
CAROL 
NOT MUCH IT IS A CHILLY START 
ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN AREAS IT IS 
A TOUCH OF FROST FIRST THING AND 
POSSIBLY SOME ICY PATCHES ON 
UNTREATED SURFACES GENERALLY TODAY 
THE FORECAST IS ONE OF SUNSHINE AND 
SHOWERS IF WE LOOK AT THE RADAR 
PICTURE WHICH 
GOES BACK TWELVE HOURS 
YOU CAN 
SEE WE 
HAVE 
HAD QUITE 
A 
SHOWERS AS 
WE HAVE 
GONE THROUGH 
THE 
COURSE OF 
THE NIGHT AND 
ALSO SOME 
RAIN THE 
MAIN COLOUR THE ACROSS 
THE NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND AT NINE 
O'CLOCK THIS IS ROUGHLY THE 
PICTURE WE EXPECT ACROSS GOAL AND 
QUITE A 
BIT OF 
CLOUD SOME SUNSHINE 
AND ALSO THAT RAIN ACROSS 
SCOTLAND IN ABERDEEN WE ARE 
SEEING IT AT LOWER LEVELS SHOWERS 
ACROSS THE SOUTH EAST BUT THERE 
WILL ALSO BE SOME LOVELY SUNSHINE 
WE HAVE IT HERE AND IN LONDON AND 
IN NEWCASTLE BRISTOL AND 
SOUTHAMPTON PLYMOUTH SHOWERS 
ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND BUT THERE 
WERE ALSO BE SOME SUNSHINE HERE SO 
THAT TELLS 
THE STORY FOR 
OF THE DAY SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS 
COMPARED YESTERDAY THE SHOWERS 
WERE GENERALLY TEND TO BE LIGHTER 
AND FEWER AND FURTHER BETWEEN 
HOWEVER WE COULD CATCH ON TO 
HEAVIER ONES DURING THE COURSE OF 
THE AFTERNOON IN PARTS OF EASTERN 
ENGLAND TEMPERATURES UP A DEGREE 
OR SO YESTERDAY PEAKING AT ABOUT 
THIRTEEN DEGREES IN LONDON THEN THROUGH 
DECEIVING AND OVERNIGHT MANY OF 
THE SHOWERS DYING AWAY BUT A NEW 
BAND OF RAIN WILL SWEEP ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND WESTERN SCOTLAND 
NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND ALSO 
PARTS OF WALES ON EITHER SIDE OF 
THAT 
IT IS 
GOING TO BE COLD 
ONCE AGAIN 
THEY WILL 
BE SOME FROST 
AROUND TOMORROW WHERE WE HAVE THE 
FIRST WE WILL HAVE 
SOME 
SKIES AND SUNSHINE 
TO START THE DAY AS THE RAIN BAND 
MOVES EASTWARDS IT WILL TEND TO 
TURN MORE SHOWERY ONCE AGAIN 
TOMORROW IT IS DAY OF SUNSHINE 
AND SHOWERS ONCE AGAIN TOMORROW 
TOO WHERE LOOKING AT THE 
TEMPERATURES OF UP A TOUCH ON TODAY 
BY DECREE ALSO A MAXIMUM IN LONDON 
OF FOURTEEN THAT'S HOW IT IS LOOKING 
DECLAN IS GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT 
WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS 
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY ISN'T 
IT THERE IS NEW CAMPAIGN 
IT THERE IS A NEW CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED TODAY BY THE FEDERATION OF 
SMALL BUSINESSES 
TO GET MORE WOMEN UP 
IN BUSINESS 
YOU 
WONDER WHY 
THEY ARE 
MAKING SUCH 
A 
FUSS ABOUT 
IT IN THE LAST BUDGET 
THE CHANCELLOR ESTIMATED THAT THE 
ECONOMY WOULD GROW BY AS MUCH AS TWO PER CENT 
WOULD BE TWO PER CENT RICHER IF WE HAD AS 
MANY WOMEN SETTING UP BUSINESS IN 
THIS COUNTRY AS THEY CURRENTLY DO 
IN THE UNITED STATES SO THE 
SITUATION IS THIS THE NUMBER OF 
WOMEN STARTING UP IN BUSINESS IS 
INCREASING IT IS UP SEVENTEEN PER CENT SINCE THE 
YEAR TWO THOUSAND BUT OUT OF FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
BUSINESSES SET UP LAST YEAR JUST 
ONE THIRD OF THOSE WERE STARTED BY 
WOMEN SO THEY STILL LIKE QUITE A 
WAY BEHIND MEN DEBORAH 
MIRNYI 
DEBORAH MEADEN IS WITH ME 
SHE IS 
ONE OF THE JUDGES FROM DRAGONS' DEN 
THERE ARE LOTS OF BARRIERS TO 
PEOPLE SETTING UP IN BUSINESS AND 
IT'S UP AND 
THIS APPLIES 
TO MEN 
AS 
WELL AS 
WOMEN THE 
PRIMARY ONE 
IS 
THE BELIEF 
THAT YOUR 
IDEA 
GOOD ENOUGH 
TO MAKE 
MONEY OUT OF IT 
ABSOLUTELY AND IT PROBABLY SHOULD 
BE A LITTLE BIT TOUGH TO SET UP BUSINESS 
BECAUSE THIS 
THIS IS TOUGH 
BUT I THINK AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
SUPPORT PEOPLE CAN GET AND 
CONFIDENCE THAT SAYS I CAN DO THIS 
I THINK IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
ISSUES PEOPLE FACE 
IS THIS 
SOMETHING THAT HOLDS WOMEN BACK IN 
PARTICULAR THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF 
OBSTACLES DOWN HERE ONE IN 
PARTICULAR IS THAT WOMEN HAVE TO 
PAY MORE INTEREST TO THE BANK IF 
THEY 
GO TO 
A 
BANK MANAGER 
WITH AN 
IDEA TO 
THEIR OWN BUSINESS 
BUT ARE THERE OTHER HIDDEN 
THAT ARE NOT QUITE SO PREVALENT I I AM NOT SURE AND I'M NOT ALSO SURE 
THAT THAT 
IS A 
MALE 
INTEREST RATES 
THAT IS QUITE A 
COMPLEX DEBATE OVER WHY THAT WOULD 
HAPPEN 
IT MIGHT BE 
TRACK RECORD 
HAPPEN IT MIGHT BE TRACK RECORD IT MIGHT BE ASSETS L. AM NOT SURE THAT THAT 
FOCUSED 
WHAT I DO THINK IS THAT WOMEN TOO 
OFTEN SUFFER FROM CONFIDENCE ISSUES 
I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD 
HELP TO OVERCOME 
THAT SELF BELIEF 
THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YES YES NOT LACKING IN CONFIDENCE YOURSELF 
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING SO HOW 
DO YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE CONFIDENCE 
THAT YOUR IDEA IS WORTH PURSUING I I THINK YOU HAVE GOT TO THINK WHAT 
IS WORRYING ME WHY AM I CONCERNED 
ABOUT THIS AND SEEK ADVICE AND 
GAIN ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE TO FEEL I 
KNOW MY SUBJECT I KNOW THIS 
UNDERSTAND THIS AND I CAN DO THIS 
AND STOP TELLING YOURSELF THAT JUST 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE HAD THE IDEA IT 
DOESN'T SOME PEOPLE SOMETIMES 
THINK IF IT IS A GOOD IDEA SOMEONE 
ELSE WILL HAVE DONE IT ALREADY 
ABSOLUTELY TO ME SOME OF THE MOST 
INTERESTING BUSINESSES ARE ONES 
THAT ARE OPERATING BUT NOT 
OPERATING TERRIBLY WELL SO IT IS 
NOT NECESSARILY A NEW IDEA IT IS 
OFTEN DOING AN IDEA THAT EXISTS AND 
DOING IT BETTER 
EITHER WAY YOU 
ARE LOOKING FOR WHAT ARE THEY 
CALLED INVESTORS FOR THE VICTIMS 
SUPPOSE OF DRAGONS' DEN 
THEY ARE 
NOT VICTIMS THEY ARE QUITE TOUGH 
SOME OF THEM WE ARE LOOKING FOR 
PICTURES 
IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA GO PICTURES ON THE WEBSITE FOR THE PROGRAMME 
AND TAKE IT FURTHER FROM THERE 
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU IN THE 
DRAGONS' DEN 
I WOULDN'T 
SEE YOU 
GET ARRESTED FOR ONCE

HELICOPTERS IN AFGHANISTAN THAT 
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WOULD BE THE 
FIRST TO DONATE TO THAT FUND IN 
ORDER TO START THE BALL ROLLING AND

WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PARKING IN 
DRIVEWAYS YOU GOING TO HAVE TO GET 
PLANNING PERMISSION IN SOME PLACES 
IN FUTURE TO PAVE OVER YOUR FRONT 
GARDEN TO PARK YOUR CAR A FEW 
VIEWS ON YOU THIS MORNING 
CATHERINE SAYS WHY NOT HAVE 
DRIVEWAYS FITTED WITH A CARD 
TURNTABLE WHICH MEANS THAT THE AREA 
OUTSIDE CAN STILL BE GRASS AND 
FLOWERS SO THE WHOLE AREA DOESN'T 
NEED TO BE CONCRETED 
SIDE EXPENSIVE POSSIBLY A MORE 
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY SURFACE IS 
A GRASS WEB SOME PEOPLE SAY PEOPLE 
GRAVEL ON A PERMEABLE SURFACE THEN 
THE WATER CAN DRAIN THROUGH BUT IF 
YOU PUT ON AN IMPERMEABLE SURFACE 
JUST RUNS OFF 
THIS SAYS IT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS IF 
THE GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO BUILD 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES ON A FLOOD PLAIN 
PAVING OVER GARDENS IS A SMALL 
ISSUE IN COMPARISON 
AND WHY CAN'T THEY HAVE DRIVEWAYS 
WITH HOLES THE SIZE OF GOLF BALLS 
FOR RAIN TO SEEP THROUGH THAT WAY 
PEOPLE COULD KEEP THEIR CONCRETE 
DRIVEWAYS BUT THE DRAINAGE WOULD BE 
GOOD GOOD LOTS OF IDEAS 
YOU WOULD LOSE ONE OR TWO CAR KEYS 
DOWN THEM BUT WORTH IT 
STILL TO COME HERE THIS MORNING WE 
ARE TALKING ABOUT LANDMARKS JULIA

GET HARDER TO DO I'LL EXPLAIN

NICK RAVENSCROFT IS OUTSIDE 
DEWSBURY MAGISTRATES COURT THIS 
MORNING GOOD MORNING 
IT'S NOW 
SEVEN WEEKS SINCE HER DISAPPEARANCE 
AFTER A SCHOOL SWIMMING TRIP AND 
PEOPLE HERE IN DEWSBURY HAVE 
FOLLOWED EVERY TWIST AND TURN OF 
THIS CASE FIRST OF ALL DURING THE 
TIME WHEN SHE WAS MISSING AND THEN 
WHEN SHE WAS FOUND AT A PROPERTY 
LESS THAN A MILE FROM WHERE SHE 
LIVED TODAY PERHAPS THE MOST 
INTRIGUING PART OF THE CASE SO FAR 
HER MOTHER WILL APPEAR HERE IN 
THE COURT BEHIND ME CHARGED IN 
CONNECTION WITH HER OWN DAUGHTER'S 
DISAPPEARANCE 
KAREN MATTHEWS LED DISAPPEARANCE THE SEARCH FOR SHANNON SHE 
APPEARED DAY AFTER DAY AS THE HUNT 
FOR HER DAUGHTER WENT ON THE NINE 
YEAR OLD WAS EVENTUALLY FOUND THREE 
WEEKS AGO IN A HOUSE A MILE FROM 
HER HOME BUT IT HAS BEEN FAR FROM 
A HAPPY ENDING LAST NIGHT HER 
MOTHER WAS CHARGED IN CONNECTION 
WITH HER DISAPPEARANCE HAVING HAVING CAREFULLY CONSIDERED ALL OF THE 
EVIDENCE PROVIDED IN THE FILE BY 
WEST YORKSHIRE POLICE WE HAVE 
DECIDED THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT 
EVIDENCE AND HAVE AUTHORISED THAT 
KAREN MATTHEWS BE CHARGED WITH 
PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE 
AND CHILD NEGLECT 
THE SEARCH FOR 
SHANNON MATTHEWS WAS THE BIGGEST IN 
WEST YORKSHIRE FOR THIRTY YEARS MORE 
THAN THREE HUNDRED POLICE OFFICERS WERE 
INVOLVED THEIR OVERTIME BILL ALONE 
WAS ONE MILLION KAREN MATTHEWS WAS 
ARRESTED ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND IS NOW 
THE SECOND PERSON TO BE CHARGED IN 
CONNECTION WITH HER DAUGHTER'S 
DISAPPEARANCE HER PARTNER'S UNCLE 
MICHAEL DONOVAN APPEARED IN COURT 
LAST MONTH ACCUSED OF KIDNAPPING 
AND FALSELY IMPRISONING SHANNON 
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SEE BEHIND ME 
THESE WORKERS ARE ERECTING BARRIERS 
THAT'S IN PREPARATION FOR THE VAN 
THAT'LL BRING KAREN MATTHEWS HERE 
TO THE MAGISTRATES COURT IN 
DEWSBURY SHE'LL STAND IN THE DOCKS 
HEAR THE CHARGE AND AT THIS EARLY 
STAGE IN THE PROCEEDINGS SHE'S NOT 
EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED TO MAKE A 
PLEA OF EITHER GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY 
MANY N. H. S. STAFF SAY THEY FEEL UNSAFE 
AND UNDERVALUED AT WORK DOCTORS 
NURSES AND HOSPITAL WORKERS 
REPORTED BEING VERBALLY ABUSED AND 
HARASSED BY THEIR PATIENT WITH 
MANY SAYING THEY HAVE BEEN 
PHYSICALLY ATTACKED CATHERINE 
MARSTON IS IN GATESHEAD FOR US THIS 
MORNING GOOD MORNING YOU SPENT 
SOME TIME IN GATE GATE A AND AMP E. THE 
OTHER NIGHT DIDN'T YOU 
YES I DID 
I SPENT LAST MONDAY EVENING HERE AT 
THE QUEEN ELIZABETH HOSPITAL IN 
GATE GATE IN THE A AND AMP E. DEPARTMENT 
WE'RE IN THE RESUSCITATION AREA AT 
THE MOMENT AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S 
VERY QUIET YOU WOULD PROBABLY 
EXPECT THAT REALLY FOR THIS TIME OF 
DAY BUT WHAT I SAW WITHIN JUST A 
FEW HOURS WAS REALLY QUITE 
ASTONISHING WE SAW TWO ATTACKS 
THE FIRST WAS A VERBAL ONE THAT 
WAS SIMPLY SWEARING AND AGGRESSION 
THE SECOND WAS FAR MORE SERIOUS 
IT'S THE PICTURES THAT YOU'RE 
LOOKING AT NOW THIS WAS A VERY 
DRUNK WOMAN SHE WAS EXCEPTIONALLY 
AGGRESSIVE SHE TRIED TO PUNCH A 
MEMBER OF STAFF AT ONE POINT SHE 
ELBOWED HIM IN THE THROAT AS YOU 
HAVE JUST SEEN SO THAT WAS REALLY 
QUITE UNPLEASANT INTERESTINGLY 
NEITHER OF THOSE INCIDENTS REPORTED 
SO THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW 
MANY THINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY EACH 
DAY WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT LET'S LOOK 
AT THE RESULTS OF THE STAFF SURVEY 
TODAY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT SAID THEY HAD SUFFERED 
SOME FORM OF ABUSE IN THE PAST YEAR 
THIRTEEN PER CENT SAID THAT THAT ABUSE HAD BEEN 
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AND PERHAPS MOST 
SHOCKINGLY OF ALL JUST SIXTY SIX PER CENT OF 
THOSE PEOPLE SAID THAT THEY HAD 
ACTUALLY GONE ON TO REPORT THE 
INCIDENT VERY MUCH IN KEEPING 
WITH WHAT WE WITNESSED HERE LAST 
MONDAY NIGHT SO I TALKED TO DOCTOR 
RUBIN ZAHARIA A SENIOR REGISTRAR 
HERE HE TOLD ME ABOUT ONE ATTACK 
WHERE HE ENDED UP BEING PUNCHED IN 
THE FACE 
WE WOKE THIS CHAP UP AND 
HE SEEMED DISORIENTATED INITIALLY 
AND THEN BASICALLY GOT VERY VERY 
AGGRESSIVE AND STARTED SMASHING THE 
WALLS SMASHING THE EQUIPMENT AND 
EVENTUALLY WITH RATHER WILD LOOKING 
EYES TOOK A SWING AT ME IT JUST 
WASN'T SOMETHING THAT I WAS READY 
FOR WASN'T SOMETHING I WAS 
EXPECTING 
LAST SEPTEMBER THE EXPECTING GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED NINETY SEVEN MILLION 
WAS GOING TO BE SPENT INVESTED IN 
TRUSTS TO TRY TO IMPROVE THE 
SITUATION CONCERNING VIOLENCE 
AGAINST STAFF NOW THAT WAS 
ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER THE SURVEY 
THAT WE'VE GOT THE RESULTS OUT 
TODAY WAS CONDUCTED IN OCTOBER SO 
OF COURSE THERE HASN'T REALLY BEEN 
THE TIME TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THAT 
EXTRA GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT HAS 
REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE UNISON 
SAY THE FIGURES TODAY ARE DEEPLY 
DEPRESSING BECAUSE THERE IS NO 
CHANGE BUT PERHAPS NEXT YEAR IN 
NEXT YEAR'S SURVEY WE MIGHT START 
TO SEE WHAT IMPACT THAT EXTRA 
INVESTMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
HAD HAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU CAN KEEP 
UP TO DATE WITH THE LATEST NEWS ON 
THIS STORY WHILE YOU'RE OUT AND 
ABOUT WITH THE B. B. C. NEWS ON YOUR 
MOBILE 
WE WERE HAVING A WE'RE HAVING A 
DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS IN A FEW 
MINUTES AREN'T WE 
IN OTHER NEWS CHINA SAYS IT 
EXPECTS THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
INTERNATIONAL RELAY TO CONTINUE 
DESPITE THE PROTESTS WHICH HAVE 
DISRUPTED ITS PROGRESS IN LONDON 
AND PARIS 
IT'S DUE TO BE CARRIED THROUGH SAN 
FRANCISCO TODAY AND MORE PRO TIBET 
DEMONSTRATIONS ARE EXPECTED LET'S 
TALK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT IN 
BEIJING QUENTIN SOMMERVILLE IT 
LOOKS LIKE THE CHINESE ARE 
DETERMINED TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS 
RELAY 
YEAH THEY SEEM ALMOST RELAY IMPERVIOUS TO CRITICISM AND TODAY 
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HERE IN 
BEIJING SAID THAT NOT ONLY DO THEY 
WANT THE INTERNATIONAL TORCH RELAY 
TO CONTINUE BUT THAT THEY WOULD 
CONTINUE TO THEY'D CONTINUE WITH 
THEIR PLANS TO TAKE THE TORCH 
THROUGH TIBET ITSELF THE TORCH 
WILL GO THROUGH THE CITY STREETS OF 
THE TIBETAN CAPITAL AND A SECOND 
TORCH WILL BE TAKEN UP M. T. EVEREST 
THE GOVERNOR OF TIBET SAID HE'LL 
PERSONALLY ASSURE THE SECURITY OF 
THE TORCH AS IT TRAVELS THROUGH 
THIS TROUBLED REGION AND ANYONE 
THAT TRIES TO DISRUPT ITS PROGRESS 
WILL BE DEALT WITH SEVERELY THERE THERE HAVE BEEN PROTESTS OF TIBETAN MONKS 
IN CHINA WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 
THERE IS A TIGHTLY CONTROLLED 
GOVERNMENT TOUR OF COURSE MOST 
JOURNALISTS AREN'T ALLOWED TO 
REPORT FROM TIBET OR THE TIBETAN 
REGIONS A TOUR HAS BEEN TAKEN 
AROUND A MONASTERY TODAY IN GANSU 
PROVINCE SOME YOUNG MONKS BURST 
INTO THAT GOVERNMENT TOUR AND 
STARTED SHOUT PROGRESS TIBETAN 
SLOGANS THEY HAD BANNER WITH 
THEM THEY SAID THEY WANTED THE 
RETURN OF THE DALAI LAMA THEY 
WANTED GREATER CULTURAL AND 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM THAT WAS A BOLD 
MOVE ON THEIR PART WHAT WE'RE 
SEEING IS WHENEVER TIBETANS HAVE 
THE OPPORTUNITY WHENEVER THEY CAN 
BE HELD WHENEVER THEY SEE 
JOURNALISTS ARE AVAILABLE THEY ARE 
PROTESTING IN A SENSE THE SAME 
THING IS HAPPENING WITH THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH THIS IS SEEN AS THE MOMENT 
CHINA MIGHT ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THE 
REST OF THE WORLD BECAUSE IT'S 
WORRIED ABOUT THE OLYMPICS 
QUENTIN SOMMERVILLE IN BEIJING 
THANK YOU 
MOHAMED AL FAYED SAYS HE'LL ABANDON 
HIS TEN YEAR LEGAL BATTLE TO PROVE 
HIS BELIEF THAT HIS SON AND THE 
PRINCESS OF WALES WERE MURDERED 
EARLIER THIS WEEK AN INQUEST PROVED 
THEY WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED DUE TO 
THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF THE DRIVER 
HENRI PAUL AND THE PAPARAZZI 
PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO WERE CHASING THEM 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND FOR THE SAKE 
OF THE TWO PRINCES WHO I KNOW 
THEY LOVE THEIR MOTHER AND CLOSE 
THEY HAVE BEEN I SAW THEM DURING 
THE HOLIDAY AND I'M SURE THEY ARE 
BLESSING IN THEIR DEEP HEART WHAT I 
AM DOING TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH BUT 
AS I SAY I HAVE ENOUGH I'M 
LEAVING THE REST FOR GOD TO GET MY 
REVENGE BUT I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING 
ANYMORE 
TWO CHARITIES WILL BEGIN ANYMORE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE 
GOVERNMENT TODAY IN AN EFFORT TO 
FORCE A NEW APPROACH TOWARDS THE 
PROBLEM OF FUEL POVERTY THREE 
MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ARE EXPECTED TO 
EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES PAYING FUEL 
BILLS IN ENGLAND ALONE THIS YEAR 
HELP THE AGED AND FRIENDS OF THE 
EARTH SAY THE GOVERNMENT'S IN 
DANGER OF MISSING ITS TARGETS ON 
ERADICATING THE PROBLEM FOR 
VULNERABLE FAMILIES 
POLICE CONFISCATED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PINTS OF 
ALCOHOLIC DRINKS DURING A CRACKDOWN 
ON UNDERAGED DRINKING IN FEBRUARY 
THE HAUL MAINLY BEER AND CIDER 
WAS SEIZED DURING A TWO WEEK 
OPERATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES THE 
ALCOHOL WAS CONFISCATED FROM MORE 
THAN 
FIVE ZERO 
YOUNG PEOPLE SOME OF 
THEM DRINKING BY THEMSELVES MOST 
OF THEM IN GROUPS THOSE ARE YOUR 
MAIN STORIES THIS MORNING 
THEY ARE INDEED IT'S EIGHT TEN A M. 
THE STATISTICS ARE SHOCKING ONE 
QUARTER OF N. H. S. STAFF IN ENGLAND 
CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN HARASSED OR 
BULLIED WHILE DOING THEIR JOB WITH 
MORE THAN ONE IN TEN SAYING THEY 
HAVE BEEN PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED 
THE FINDINGS OF THE N. H. S. STAFF 
SURVEY ARE WIDELY REGARDED AS A 
BETTER INDICATOR OF WHAT HAPPENS IN 
OUR HOSPITALS THAN OFFICIAL RECORDS 
SO ARE THE FIGURES AS BLEAK AS THEY 
HAVE JUST SEEMED RICHARD BRAMPTON 
AND WE HAVE A NURSE WITH US TELL 
US WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU 
DURING MY 
TRAINING AS A NURSE I WAS LEFT ON 
MY OWN WITH A CLIENT THAT WAS A 
RISK WHO BECAME AGITATED AND 
VIOLENT AND A FAIRLY MINOR ATTACK 
IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS BUT WAS 
SCRATCHED DOWN MY FACE AND NECK AND 
WAS QUITE SHAKEN UP AS AN EIGHTEEN YEAR 
OLD STUDENT AT THE TIME NO NO SURPRISE AT ALL HOW DID THAT MAKE 
YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR JOB AND GOING 
INTO WORK 
IT OBVIOUSLY GAVE ME 
QUITE A LOT OF APPREHENSION ABOUT 
GOING BACK THE NEXT DAY AND I 
THINK WHEN THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPEN 
TO YOU YOU JUST RELY ON YOUR 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO GET THROUGH 
AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE 
IN THE CAREER THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS 
WANTED 
RICHARD IT SEEMS THIS SORT WANTED OF THING IS ALL TOO ROUTINE THESE 
DAYS IT 
DO S. 
HAPPEN ALARMINGLY DAYS FREQUENTLY HOWEVER IF YOU LOOK AT 
THE SIZE OF THE N. H. S. AND THE NUMBER 
OF INTERACTIONS WE HAVE IN 
HOSPITALS IN G. P. SURGERIES AND 
AMBULANCES THE NUMBER OF ASSAULTS 
WHILST ONE IS TOO MANY ARE ABOUT A 
LEVEL OF FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR 
MORE THAN A 
QUARTER OF ALL STAFF HAVE BEEN 
HARASSED BULLIED OR ABUSED BY 
PATIENTS OR THEIR RELATIVES THAT'S 
FAR TOO HIGH A STATISTIC 
THAT IS ANY ATTACK ON AN N. H. S. 
MEMBER OF STAFF IS INEXCUSABLE OUR 
MESSAGE TO THE MINDLESS MINORITY IS 
ENGAGE YOUR BRAIN THINK AGAIN 
WE'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK 
THE N. H. S. IS THERE TO HELP YOU 
RESPECT IT AND THE STAFF WITHIN IT 
O. K. JAMES WHAT ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL 
SAFETY WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WHAT DO 
YOU THINK COULD BE DOWN ON A DAY 
TO DAY BASIS TO MAKE YOU FEEL SAFER 
AND PERHAPS GET HELP MORE EASILY 
ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES IS STAFFING 
LEVELS BECAUSE IDEALLY WE'RE ABLE 
TO DEFUSE ANY VIOLENT INCIDENTS 
BEFORE THEY OCCUR BUT THAT MEANS 
THAT YOU HAVE TO BE IN A WELL 
STAFFED LOW STRESS ENVIRONMENT SO 
THAT YOU CAN COPE WITH ANY ISSUES 
WHEN THEY COME UP AND STAFF CAN 
SUPPORT EACH OTHER WE ALSO NEED TO 
MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT MORE SECURITY 
STAFF ON THE GROUND IN MY HOSPITAL 
WE HAVE ONE MEMBER OF SECURITY 
STAFF ON AT ONE TIME AND FOR MAJOR 
A MAJOR EUROPEAN HOSPITAL THAT'S 
JUST NOT ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH ISSUES 
WHEN THEY ARISE 
WE'RE JUST LOOKING 
AT PICTURES THERE OF THE SORT OF 
THING THAT GOES ON IT SEEMS IT 
HAPPENS ON AN ALL TOO REGULAR BASIS 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET ASIDE MONEY 
TO HELP IMPROVE THE SITUATION BUT 
THAT MONEY HASN'T KICKED IN YET IS 
IT RING FENCED 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT 
IS THE REASON FOR THAT IS ONLY 
LOCAL TRUSTS CAN DETERMINE 
PRECISELY WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AT A 
LOCAL LEVEL THE MONEY IS ALLOCATED 
TO THOSE TRUSTS AND THEY MAY 
HAVE 
ARE YOU SEEING ANY HAVE IMPROVEMENT BECAUSE THE SURVEY WAS 
DONE BEFORE THE MONEY KICKED IN 
IT'S WORTH NOTING SINCE WE RECORDED 
THE NUMBER OF ASSAULTS WITHIN THE 
N. H. S. WE HAVE SEEN REDUCTION OF 
FIVE THOUSAND REPORTED PHYSICAL ASSAULTS 
THINK WHAT WE NEED TO LEARN FROM 
THIS SURVEY IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
NOT REPORTING 
WE SAW THAT WITH 
CATHERINE MARSTON IN GATE GATE THE 
TWO INCIDENTS SHE SAW WEREN'T 
REPORTED YET THAT REALLY AFFECTS 
THE WAY STAFF 
INDEED IF YOU'VE 
GOT A MEMBER OF N. H. S. STAFF ASSAULTED 
AND THAT'S NOT REPORTED WE NEED TO 
LEARN FROM EVERY INCIDENT OF 
ASSAULT SO THAT THE NEXT TIME THAT 
PERSON WHO IS POTENTIALLY VIOLENT 
OR ABUSIVE ENTERS A HOSPITAL 
PEOPLE KNOW THAT THAT PERSON HAS 
ASSAULTED SOMEBODY AND WE CAN TAKE 
ACTION AGAINST THEM 
O. K. THANKS 
BOTH VERY MUCH FOR THAT THANK YOU 
LET'S HOPE YOU'RE SAFE IN YOUR WORK 
IN THE FUTURE 
YES 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME YES TODAY TODAY TIM MUFFETT IS ASKING IF FLOWERS OR 
FOUR BY FOURS TAKE PRIORITY IN YOUR GARDEN 
TO PAVE OR NOT TO PAVE THAT IS 
THE QUESTION FOR MANY HOMEOWNERS 
BUT PAVING YOUR FRONT GARDEN IS SET 
TO GET LOT HARDER I'LL EXPLAIN 
WHY IN JUST A MOMENT KYLIE'S KYLIE'S INTUITION TOLD HER SHE HAD CANCER 
INITIALLY HER DOCTORS DISAGREED 
WHO SHOULD YOU LISTEN TO IF YOU 
THINK YOU'RE ILL 
ALSO ACTOR JIM STURGESS WILL BE 
HERE ON THE SOFA TO TELL US ABOUT 
LEARNING TO BEAT THE CASINOS IN 
THEIR OWN GAME IN HIS NEW FILM 
TWENTYONE 
IT IS ALL ABOUT COUNTING CARDS AND 
MAKING MONEY 
AND BEING VERY CLEVER 
AT MATHS 
WHICH WE ARE NOT CAROL 
IS THOUGH 
GOOD MORNING IT IS A COLD START 
MY MATHS TELLS ME THAT FOR MANY OF 
US IT IS BELOW FREEZING SO A TOUCH 
OF FROST AND SOME ICY PATCHES ON 
UNTREATED SERVICES TODAY NOT BAD 
AT ALL SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS FOR 
MOST OF THE BRITISH ISLES ON THE 
RADAR PICTURE WE SEE WE HAVE HAD A 
LOT OF SHOWERS WE HAVE SOME RAIN 
ACROSS NORTH EASTERN SCOTLAND BUT 
THAT IS FALLING AS SNOW ON HIGHER 
GROUND AND EVEN AT LOWER LEVELS 
AROUND ABERDEENSHIRE THAT WILL 
CARRY ON THROUGH THIS EVENING 
THIS MORNING AWAY FROM THAT 
BRIGHTER SKIES AND SUNSHINE IN 
NORTH WEST ENGLAND A BIT MORE 
CLOUD BUT BREAKING AT BREAKING 
IN PARTS FURTHER SOUTH EAST 
ANGLIA THE MIDLANDS AND WALES WE 
ARE LOOKING AT SOME BEAUTIFUL 
SUNNY SKIES ALTHOUGH THERE IS A 
BIT OF MIST CURRENTLY THAT WILL 
CLEAR AND IT WILL WARM UP QUICKLY 
FOR THE NORTH OF WALES A BIT MORE 
CLOUD AND SOME SHOWERS THIS MORNING 
SHOWERS ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND AS 
WELL IN BETWEEN SOME SUNSHINE 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS IS THE 
FORECAST FOR THE DAY THE SHOWERS 
WILL BE LIGHTER THAN YESTERDAY AND 
FEWER AND FURTHER BETWEEN THROUGH 
THE AFTERNOON PARTS OF EASTERN 
ENGLAND COULD CATCH ONE OR TWO 
HEAVY ONES TEMPERATURES LIKE 
YESTERDAY THROUGH THIS EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT MANY OF THE SHOWERS WILL 
TEND TO DIE AWAY THERE WILL BE 
BREAKS IN THE CLOUD SO COLD AND 
FROSTY A NEW BAND OF RAIN COMES 
DOWN ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
EDGING INTO WESTERN SCOTLAND AND 
INTO WALES THROUGH TOMORROW THAT 
BAND OF RAIN WILL STILL BE IN 
SCOTLAND BUT IT WILL TURN MORE 
SHOWERY IN NATURE AS IT MOVES 
EASTWARDS TOMORROW LIKE TODAY IS 
ANOTHER DAY OF SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS 
BUT MANY WILL SEE MORE SUNSHINE 
TEMPERATURES UP A NOTCH ON TODAY A 
MAXIMUM OF FOURTEEN CELSIUS THE OUTLOOK 
REMAINS UNSETTLED THAT IS HOW IT 
IS LOOKING 
WELL SOME OF US WILL GET SOME 
SUNSHINE 
THIS IS A STORY WE HAVE BEEN 
MONITORING BUT WE KNOW ARE NOW IN A 
POSITION TO GIVE YOU SOME 
INFORMATION BECAUSE WE HAVE IT 
FROM ENOUGH SOURCES IT LOOKS LIKE 
THE BUDGET AIRLINE OASIS AIRLINES 
WHICH FLIES FROM THE U. K. TO HONG 
KONG AND OTHER PARTS OF ASIA THAT 
THAT IS RUNNING INTO SOME SORT OF 
FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY ONE TRAVEL 
AGENCY SAYS IT HAS STOPPED TAKING 
BOOKINGS HONG KONG AIRLINES 
AIRPORT SAYS TONIGHT'S FLIGHTS BY 
THE AIRLINE HAVE BEEN CANCELLED 
THERE IS A REPORT THAT THE COMPANY 
HAS APPLIED TO THE COURT TO APPOINT 
A LIQUIDATOR SO ARE DEVELOPING 
PROBLEM AT HONG KONG OASIS AIRLINES 
BUT DEVELOPING PROBLEM THEY WERE 
IN THIS STUDIO ON THE DAY THEY 
LAUNCHED THEIR SERVICE THE OTHER 
STORY WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING IS THE 
WARNING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL 
MONETARY FUND THE I. M. F. AND MANY OF 
YOU WILL REMEMBER THEM FROM THE 
TIME THEY BAILED OUT THE BRITISH 
GOVERNMENT IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE I. M. F. IS 
SAYING THEY EXPECT SLOWER GROWTH IN 
THE U. K. ECONOMY THE SLOWEST SINCE 
THE END OF THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
BUT THE ECONOMY WILL STILL EXPAND 
FASTER THAN GERMANY AND THE HUW 
THE E. U. 
WHERE OH WHERE TO PARK THE CAR 
EVEN OUTSIDE YOUR HOME ONE 
SOLUTION FOR MANY HOMEOWNERS IS TO 
GET RID OF THE GREENERY IN YOUR 
FRONT GARDEN AND PAID IT OVER ONE 
REVIEWER PUT IT NICELY CARBON OR 
GARDEN THERE ARE FEARS THAT THIS 
INCREASES THE RISK OF FLOODING TIM 
MUFFETT IS IN HOVE 
GOOD MORNING LET ME INTRODUCE YOU 
TO TWO NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOURS JANE 
HAD HER FRONT GARDEN PAVED OVER A 
FEW YEARS AGO SARAH NEXT DOOR IS 
THINKING ABOUT GETTING THE SAME 
DONE TO HER FRONT GARDEN BUT 
UNLESS SHE DOES IT SOON IT COULD 
BECOME A LOT MORE COMPLICATED 
WHEN THERE IS A FLOOD DISRUPTION 
AND MISERY ARE SURE TO FOLLOW BUT 
ARE THEY BEYOND OUR CONTROL OR 
HAVE OUR ACTIONS ACTUALLY MADE THEM 
MORE LIKELY PAVED OVER FRONT 
GARDENS ARE AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR 
CHOICE IT CAN BE A VERY CONVENIENT 
PLACE TO PARK THE CAR BUT WHEREAS 
GRASS OR SOIL IS GOOD AT ABSORBING 
WATER PAVING ASPHALT OR CONCRETE 
IS NOT IT CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT 
OF WATER WHICH RUNS OFF BY UP TO FIFTY 
PER CENT IF IT IS JUST ONE GARTON IT IS 
NOT A PROBLEM BUT IF MANY GARDENS 
IN WANT STREET HAVE THAT THE WATER 
HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE USUALLY INTO 
A DRAIN BUT SOMETIMES DREAMS CAN'T 
COPE IN ENGLAND PAVING THE FRONT 
GARDEN IS SET TO GET HARDER LATER 
THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU 
WILL NEED PLANNING PERMISSION THE 
ONLY EXCEPTION WILL BE SPECIALLY 
DESIGNED A POROUS PAVING OR GRAVEL 
ANNE HAS JUST HAD HER FRONT GARDEN 
PAVED OVER 
BUT PARKING HAS GOT 
WORSE OVER THE LAST YEAR BY BY GETTING IT DONE NOW SHE HAS 
AVOIDED THE PLANNING PERMISSION FOR 
OTHERS WILL SOON NEED 
IT MIGHT 
STOP SOME PEOPLE GOING AHEAD AND 
DOING IT THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT 
OF PEOPLE WHO CAN'T BE BOTHERED 
WITH THE HASSLE YOU HIT A FEW 
BARRIERS A BIT OF RED TAPE AND YOU 
JUST LEAVE IT 
THE ROYAL COURT A 
ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY HAVE 
BEEN CALLING FOR TOUGHER REGULATION 
FOUR YEARS AND THEY ARE DELIGHTED 
IT IS THE FIRST LEGISLATION THAT 
DIRECTLY LINKS TO FRONT GARDENS 
THIS PROPER PROTECTION THE THINGS 
BEFORE HAVE BEEN RATHER PERIPHERAL 
AND OPEN TO INTERPRETATION SO THIS 
SET IT DOWN AND SAYS WE CAN 
PROTECT FRONT GARDENS AT LEAST 
FROM BEING SOLIDLY CONCRETED OVER 
THE SOCIETY BELIEVES ANYBODY 
DETERMINED TO TRANSFORM THEIR FRONT 
GARDEN SHOULD AT LEAST CONSIDER 
GRAVEL LIKE THE HOME OFFICE 
DRIVEWAY DRIVEWAY THEY HAVE USED GRAVEL HERE THEY THEY HAVE THERE IS PLENTY OF GAPS 
BETWEEN THE GRAVEL THOSE ALLOWED 
THE WATER THROUGH INTO THE GROUND 
BELOW 
FLOODS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO BELOW STOP ALTOGETHER BUT MANY FIRMLY 
BELIEVE THEY WILL BE LESS LIKELY IF 
THERE ARE FEWER OF THESE 
WELL SARAH DO YOU THINK YOU ARE 
GOING TO GET IT DONE YOUR GARDEN 
IS LOOKING LOVELY 
YES PROBABLY 
BUT WE ARE LOOKING INTO 
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY 
ALTERNATIVE TO PAVING 
WHY DO YOU 
WANT TO TRANSFORM THIS INTO A 
DRIVEWAY 
THE COUNCIL WANT TO PUT DRIVEWAY IN A PARKING SCHEME SO WE WOULD 
HAVE TO PAY TO POPS OUT PARK 
OUTSIDE OUR HOUSE 
THE PARKING 
ISSUE SEEMS TO BE THE DRIVING FORCE 
WE EXPECT THE NEW REGULATIONS 
AROUND OCTOBER ALTHOUGH THAT HAS 
NOT BEEN CONFIRMED IT SEEMS AS 
THOUGH TWO THIRDS OF THE HOUSES 
AFFECTED BY THE FLOODS LAST YEAR 
MOST OF THAT DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY 
SURFACE WATER RUNNING OFF THE 
DAMAGE RAN TO THREE BILLION THE 
NORWICH UNION HAS SAID TODAY THAT 
THE MAJORITY OF HOUSES AFFECTED BY 
FLOODING LAST YEAR HAVE DONE 
NOTHING TO LESSEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF 
FLOODING IN THE FUTURE THEY SAY 
PEOPLE SHOULD BE SEALING THEIR 
WINDOWS MAYBE INSTALLING PUMPS AND 
SUCH LIKE I'M SURE MANY PEOPLE 
WILL THINK IS IT DOWN TO US 
SHOULDN'T THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
WATER COMPANIES AND THE GOVERNMENT 
BE DOING MORE TO MAINTAIN FLOOD 
DEFENCES AND IMPROVE DRAINAGE IF 
YOU WANT TO GET YOUR FRONT DRIVEWAY 
CONCRETED OVER THAT IS GOING TO BE 
MORE DIFFICULT LATER THIS YEAR 
SEVERAL OF YOU HAVE USED ABOUT THIS 
MANDY SAYS THEY HAD THEIR GARDEN 
PAVED OVER BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT 
PARK OUTSIDE BECAUSE PEOPLE WORK IN 
THE TOWN AND IT IS FREE ALL DAY 
ANNE HAS E. MAILED FROM SPAIN WHY 
DOESN'T THE U. K. DO THE SAME AS THE 
SPANISH AND PUT GARAGE IS UNDER 
HOUSE IS THAT WOULD SOLVE THE 
PROBLEMS 
GARAGES MIKE SAYS THAT PROBLEMS SUPERMARKET PARKING FACILITIES ARE 
A MAJOR PROBLEM AND CONTRIBUTE TO 
FLOODING 
LIZ SAYS WE HAD FLOODING ARTIFICIAL GRASS PUT IN LAST YEAR 
IT IS INSTALLED INTO A COMPACTED 
SAND BASE AND DRAINS WELL SHE SAYS 
THE MANUFACTURERS CLAIM IT IS MORE 
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY THAN A 
REAL LAWN

TALK ABOUT HOUSE PRICES IT'S A 
NATIONAL OBSCESSION EVERYONE SEEMS 
TO HAVE AN OPINION ON WHETHER 
THEY'RE GOING UP OR DOWN OR WHAT 
WILL HAPPEN TO THE MARKET OF THE 
THE HALIFAX IS REPORTING THAT 
PRICES IN MARCH EXPERIENCED THEIR 
BIGGEST DROP SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO GORDON 
BROWN SAYS THE FALL OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IS 
CONTAINABLE BUT REASSURANCES LIKE 
THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY 
FOR THOSE FIRST TIME BUYERS WE 
TALK TO ONE WHO HAS DECIDED TO PULL 
OUT OF HIS PURCHASE 
MY NAME IS RICHARD I'M THIRTY YEARS 
OLD I'VE BEEN WAITING TO GET ON 
THE PROPERTY LADDER FOR THE LAST 
THREE TO FOUR YEARS L. FINALLY PUT 
AND OFFER IN JANUARY FOR A FLAT IN 
SOUTH SEA JUST BEFORE EXCHANGEING 
I DECIDED TO PULL OUT DUE TO THE 
POSSIBLE PROPERTY CRASH COMING 
EVEN THOUGH OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS 
THERE'S BEEN TALK OF A PROPERTY 
CRASH IT REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE 
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR IT 
WAS THE PROPERTY I WAS LOOKING FOR 
HOWEVER THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF 
SIMILAR PROPERTIES IN A SIMILAR 
LOCATION ON THE MARKET L. THINK 
EVEN SIX OR TWELVE MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD 
I WILL BE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING 
THAT I'M HAPPY WITH 
I DO FEEL THAT I'VE DONE THE RIGHT 
THING I DIDN'T COME TO THE 
DECISION LIGHTLY BUT NOW THAT I'VE 
MADE IT I'M HAPPY TO LOSE THE 
PROPERTY EVEN THOUGH I DID LIKE IT 
I'LL BE HAPPY TO RENT NOW MAINLY 
BECAUSE I COULD SEE IF I DID 
PURCHASE THIS PROPERTY I COULD END 
UP LOSING THOUSANDS OF POUNDS 
THAT WAS RICHARD'S STORY PERSONAL 
FINANCE EXPERT JASMINE BIRTLES IS 
HERE WITH PROPERTY DEVELOPER AND V. 
PRESENTER GARY MCCAUSLAND 
JASMINE HOW BAD IS IT 
IT DEPENDS 
ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT PRICES ARE 
DEFINITELY COMING DOWN AND I THINK 
THEY WILL COME DOWN IT NEEDS TO 
COME DOWN THE HOUSE PRICES HAVE 
GONE UP FAR TOO MUCH REALLY IN THE 
LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE BEEN 
ESSENTIALLY WAITING FOR THIS 
CORRECTION THE WORLD BANK SAYS 
THAT OUR PROPERTY IS THIRTY PER CENT OVERVALUED 
SO REALLY IF YOU'RE A BUYER THIS 
IS NOT BAD OF COURSE IF YOU'RE 
HAVING TO SELL NOW IT IS BUT IF 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SELL I WOULD 
WAIT WAIT GARY YOU THINK THOUGH IT'S ALSO A 
GOOD TIME TO BE BUYING IN SOME 
RESPECTS 
IT'S A CHALLENGING TIME RESPECTS BUT WE ARE AT THE TOP OF A CYCLE 
ANYWAY WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE 
MORTGAGE APPROVAL SO PEOPLE AREN'T 
GETTING MONEY TO BUY PROPERTY ON 
THE GREAT SCHEME OF THINGS 
PROPERTY IS A GREAT INVESTMENT 
LONG TERM IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD BET 
WHY BUY AT THE TOP OF THE MARKET 
WHEN YOU KNOW IT'S VALUE IS GOING 
TO GO DOWN TEN PER CENT OR MAYBE MORE I I DON'T THINK WE'RE AT THE TOP OF THE 
MARKET NOW L. THINK THE PROPERTY MARKET IS STARTING TO DIP RIGHT 
NOW IF YOU HAVE CASH IT'S AN 
INTERESTING TIME TO BUY BECAUSE 
THERE IS A LOT OF MOTIVATED SELLERS 
OUT THERE SO YOU CAN GET A BARGAIN 
WE'RE NOT IN A NINETEEN NINETIES POSITION WHERE 
WE HAD FIFTEEN PER CENT INTEREST RATES TEN PER CENT 
INFLATION HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT WE 
HAVE A ROBUST ECONOMY SUPPORTING 
THE HOUSING MARKET 
JAS MEN HOW DO 
YOU GET THE BARGAINS JASMINE HOW 
DO YOU GET THE BARGAINS 
IF YOU DO 
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING SOMEBODY 
LIKE GARY FOR EXAMPLE KNOWS THE 
MARKET THEN YOU'RE IN A GOOD 
POSITION I PERSONALLY WOULD BE 
OFFERING AT LEAST TWENTY PER CENT BELOW THE 
PRICE TWENTY PER CENT LE 
OFFER SILLY MONEY PRICE TWENTY PER CENT LE THEY CAN SAY NO 
THAT WOULDN'T GET 
FAR FROM SCOTLAND HOUSE PRICES ARE 
GOING UP AND IN CERTAIN PARTS OF 
LONDON 
IT IS MIXED ABSOLUTELY IF LONDON YOU KNOW THE MARKET IF YOUR 
PARTICULAR AREA YOU'LL BE ABLE TO 
WATCH IT FOR SOME PEOPLE 
PARTICULARLY FIRST TIME BUYERS I 
WOULD SAY WAIT IF I WERE A FIRST 
TIME BUYER I WOULD BE THINKING I 
WAS GOING TO WAIT FOR POSSIBLY A 
YEAR AND PUT AS MUCH MONEY AS I CAN 
INTO A GOOD HIGH INTEREST SAVINGS 
ACCOUNT AND THERE ARE QUITE A FEW 
AND WATCH THE PRICES COME DOWN AND 
THEN BUY 
ON THAT THOUGH WE'VE 
SEEN THE MORTGAGE MARKET TIGHTENING 
UP AS WELL SOME OF THE FIRST TIME 
BUYERS WILL FIND IT REALLY 
DIFFICULT TO GET ONE AT ALL YEAH YEAH IT'S REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT FOR 
FIRST TIME BUYERS I'VE SEEN IN THE 
DEVELOPMENTS I DO IT'S THEIR 
PARENTS PUTTING UP THE DEPOSITS OR 
THEY'RE GETTING THEIR DEPOSITS FROM 
SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY'RE STRUGGLING 
TO GET ON THE HOUSING MARKET IT'S 
SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT COULD HELP 
THEM WITH 
THE HOUSING LADDER IS 
MISSING A RUNG 
IT IS 
YOU SAY IT 
WASN'T LIKE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES BECAUSE 
THE ECONOMY IS MORE ROBUST IN THE 
EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES YOU DIDN'T HAVE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
MORTGAGES EITHER 
I THINK THAT'S 
PART OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM IT'S 
MISSELLING OF MORTGAGES THAT 
HAPPENED GROSSLY IN AMERICA 
THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF IT OVER HERE 
GIVING SOMEONE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE VALUE OF 
THE PROPERTY IS A RECIPE FOR 
DISASTER 
HOW MANY OF THOSE DISASTER MORTGAGES ARE THERE OUT THERE LOTS LOTS OF THEM 
STNT THAT A DISASTER 
WAITING TO HAPPEN 
IT IS THAT'S 
NOT THE PROPERTY MARKET'S FAULT 
THAT'S LENDERS BEING IRRESPONSIBLE 
THE CHANCELLOR ALASTAIR DARLING 
HAS BEEN LOOKING TODAY AT WAYS OF 
FREEING UP THE MORTGAGE MARKET HOW 
MUCH CAN THE GOVERNMENT DO AND CAN 
THEY SELL SAVE THE MARKET THEY THEY MISSED A HUGE TRICK I THOUGHT 
THEY'D RAISE THE STAMP DUTY 
THRESHOLD AND THEY DIDN'T THEY 
COULD BRING IN MORTGAGE INTEREST 
TAX RELIEF THEY COULD LIGHTEN UP 
THE PLANNING POLICY THE WHOLE 
PLANNING SYSTEM IS A NIGHTMARE I'M 
IN IT EVERY DAY I KNOW HOW 
DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET ANYTHING 
THROUGH 
WHEN IT COMES TO LENDING THROUGH I'M NOT SURE THEY HAVE THAT MUCH 
POWER THE INTEREST RATES HAVE COME 
DOWN BUT MORTGAGE PRICES HAVE GONE 
UP THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH THESE ARE GLOBAL FACTORS 
BANKS ARE FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO 
BORROW FROM EACH OTHER OUR 
GOVERNMENT IS RELATIVELY POWERLESS 
OVER THAT 
IF YOU ARE UP AGAINST IT 
AND DO NEED TO SELL WHAT CAN YOU 
DO 
I THINK YOU NEED TO REALLY DO DO THE VERY BEST YOU CAN TO MAKE YOUR 
HOME LOOK AS ATTRACTIVE AS POSSIBLE 
IF IT MEANS SPENDING A LITTLE BIT 
OF MONEY TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD THEN 
DO IT BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE PRICE 
THAT YOU HAVE IT AT IF YOU HAVE IT 
VALUED FROM AND TO PUT IT ON AT 
THE LOWEST LEVEL BE SENSIBLE BE 
REALISTIC REALISTIC O. K. I'M NOT SURE YOU'VE CHEERED US 
UP BUT THANK YOU FOR JOINING US 
I'M SURE IT'S TOPIC WE'LL COME 
BACK TO TIME AND AGAIN YOUR 
INSTINCT TELLS YOU SOMETHING IS 
WRONG HEALTH WISE YOUR DOCTOR SAYS 
YOU'RE FINE WHO DO YOU LISTEN TO 
ON AMERICAN TELEVISION KYLIE 
MINOGUE SAYS HER BREAST CANCER WAS 
INITIALLY MISSED BY DOCTORS 
LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT THE SINGER 
TOLD THE CHAT SHOW HOST ELLEN 
DEGENERES ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE YOU WANT TOUR TWO YEARS AGO AND 
DISCOVERED A LUMP 
AND FOUND YOU HAD 
CANCER 
WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST CANCER THOUGHT 
LISTEN THIS IS AN THOUGHT OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SAY SOMETHING 
THAT I HAVE NOT SAID BEFORE L. WAS 
MISDIAGNOSED INITIALLY WOW 
SO MY WOW MESSAGE TO ALL OF YOU AND EVERYONE 
AT HOME IS BECAUSE SOMEONE IS IN 
A WHITE COAT AND USING BIG MEDICAL 
INSTRUMENTS DOESN'T NECESSARILY 
MEAN THEY ARE RIGHT THE MAP OF 
STORIES THAT HAVE HEARD OF WOMEN 
GOING FOR A DIAGNOSIS BEING TOLD 
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT THING 
COMMITTEES FIND AND SO I WAS 
WATCHING THE SENATOR BEFORE AND I 
BACK HER UP ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THAT IT IS IN 
THE DIAGNOSIS AND EARLY TREATMENT 
SO ACTUALLY DID MY SHOWGIRL TOUR OF 
HAVING BEEN FOR CHEQUE AND TOLD 
EVERYTHING WAS FINE TOLD FINE AND THEN AFTER 
THE FACT FIND OUT YOU'RE 
MISDIAGNOSE WOW 
AND SHE SAID CAIMMI DOESN'T WANT 
TO ALARM ANYBODY WE WILL TALK MORE 
ABOUT THIS NOW WITH ANTONIA DEAN 
CLINICAL NURSE FOR BREAST CANCER 
CARE AND DEBBIE VEEL WHO HAS HAD 
BREAST CANCER HERSELF DEBBIE YOU 
WERE DIAGNOSED LAST YEAR AND HAD A 
SIMILAR EXPERIENCE TO WHAT KIND 
WENT THROUGH 
YES I FOUND I HAD A 
PAIN AND THEN I DID A SELF 
EXAMINATION 
AND I 
FOUND 
A LUMP 
AND 
I WENT 
TO MY G. P. INITIALLY HE 
THOUGHT IT WAS AN INFECTION SO HE 
GAVE ME ANTIBIOTICS AND HE DID SAY 
I WASN'T 
HAPPY TO COME BACK IN A 
WEEK AND IT HADN'T CLEARED IT 
HADN'T MADE ANY DIFFERENCE 
SO I 
WENT BACK 
IN A 
WEEK 
AND HE 
THE OFF TO THE DIAGNOSIS AND 
TREATMENT CENTRE AT BASINGSTOKE SO SO THE DIAGNOSIS WASN'T WRONG FOR TOO 
LONG 
NO HE WAS I GUESS THEY LONG DON'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT AND THE 
THINGS THERE WHEN I GOT TO THE 
DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT CENTRE HAD 
A MAMMOGRAM AND AN ULTRASOUND AND A 
BIOPSY THEN THEY DECIDED THE 
CONSULTANTS DECIDED I NEEDED A 
MASTECTOMY FROM THAT AND I HAD 
RECONSTRUCTION THE STAFF THERE 
WERE BRILLIANT THEY WERE 
ABSOLUTELY FIRST RATE BUT THEY 
FOUND THAT IT WAS MAINLY PRECANCER 
SO IT HAD NOT SPREAD IT HAD NOT 
SPREAD TO THE LIMB LYMPH NODES 
ALL THE TISSUE L. WAS AMAZINGLY 
RELIEVED AND I DIDN'T NEED ANY 
CHEMOTHERAPY OR RADIOTHERAPY SO I 
KIND OF WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO 
HELP WHICH IS WHY I JOINED 
MACMILLAN CANCER SUPPORT HOW HOW COMMON IS IT THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
EITHER A DELAY LIKE DEBBIE OR EVEN 
LIKE KYLIE ACTUALLY A MISDIAGNOSED 
IS THAT COMMON 
IT IS INCREDIBLY 
RARE FOR PEOPLE TO BE MISDIAGNOSED 
UNFORTUNATELY NO MEDICAL TEST IS 
ABSOLUTELY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT BUT THE VAST 
VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WILL GET 
THE RIGHT DIAGNOSIS FIRST TIME SO 
I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT 
ED BUT IF ANYBODY DOES NOTICE 
SOMETHING WILL 
THEY ARE 
THAT THEY GO TO THEIR G. P. 
IS THE 
EARLY WARNING SIGN A LUMP 
IT COULD 
BE A MUM IT COULD BE 
BASED IN 
THE 
ANYTHING THAT IS DIFFERENT SO 
PERHAPS A 
THICKENING OF 
THE TISSUE 
OF THE 
BREAST A 
DIMPLING 
OF THE 
BREAST A CHANGE TO THE NICK PAUL 
A 
PAIN IN 
ONE 
PART OF 
THE BREAST 
AS 
YOU SAY 
THERE COULD BE 
THAT IS DIFFERENT NOT JUST A LUMP 
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO GO TO A G. P. 
WITH 
EVERYTHING YOU 
GO 
TO A 
G. P. AND 
PERHAPS YOU'RE NOT HAPPY PEOPLE 
ARE CONFUSED WHERE CAN YOU GO 
NEXT 
G. P.'S DO HAVE VERY HELPFUL NEXT REFERRAL GUIDELINES TO DECIDE WHO 
TO REFER AND NOT WHO NOT SUIT AND 
TO NOT TO BUT IF PEOPLE ARE 
CONCERNED THEY CAN EITHER GO BACK 
TO THE SAME 
G. P. IF 
THEY JUST 
WANT 
TO 
TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN THEY CAN 
PERHAPS ASKED TO 
MAKE ANOTHER 
APPOINTMENT 
WITH THE 
SAME PRACTICE 
OR IF 
THEY FEEL VERY 
UNHAPPY FOR 
SOME 
REASON WITH 
THE 
CARE THEY 
HAVE 
HAD THEY 
COULD ALWAYS 
REGISTER 
WITH A DIFFERENT G. P. 
SO YOU ARE 
WITHIN YOUR RIGHTS IF YOU ARE WITH 
A PRACTICE WITH SEVERAL DOCTORS TO 
ASK TO SEE A DIFFERENT DOCTOR TO 
GET THE SECOND OPINION 
YES FOR 
MOST PEOPLE IT WON'T BE NECESSARY 
BUT PEOPLE SHOULD BE 
AWARE THAT 
IT 
IS THERE IF THEY NEEDED DID YOU 
THINK OF DOING THAT DEBBIE REALLY REALLY IT WAS ONLY WEEK OF ANTIBIOTICS SO 
IT WAS NOT A MAJOR DELAY THEN I 
WAS REFERRED STRAIGHT AWAY AND AT 
AN APPOINTMENT AT THE HOSPITAL 
WITHIN A MONTH 
KYLIE SEEMED TO 
THINK IN HER MIND THAT SOMETHING 
REALLY WAS WRONG DID YOU THINK 
THAT AT THE TIME 
I WAS KIND OF IN 
TWO MINDS IF THAT MAKES SENSE L. 
WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT IT DIDN'T 
FEEL QUITE RIGHT SO 
I WOULD 
HAVE 
PURSUED 
IT I 
THINK IF 
I HAD 
NOT 
BEEN DEALT WITH SO PROMPTLY AND AND TONY THE INITIAL DIAGNOSIS IN 
DEBBIE'S CASE WAS A WAS AN 
INFECTION LUMP INFECTION DOESN'T 
MAKE SENSE TO AN ORDINARY LAYMAN 
LIKE ME BUT DOES THAT HAPPEN 
OCCASIONALLY INFECTIONS CAN PRESENT 
WITH A LUMP BECAUSE THE PRESS HAS 
BUT SAYING IT THE INFORMATION CAN 
CAUSE A LUMP THE BREAST HAS 
DUCKEDS 
DEBBIE HOW ARE YOU NOW DUCKEDS I AM VERY WELL 
I AM PLEASED TO HEAR 
THAT PNQ VERY MUCH FOR TELLING US 
YOUR STORY 
COMING UP WE HAVE GEORGE CLOONEY 
AND KIM WILDE FIRST CAROL 
TO BE IN THE SAME SENTENCE AS THOSE 
TOOT WE STILL HAVE TEMPERATURES 
BELOW FREEZING AND FOR SOME OF US 
IT IS SNOWING FOR THE BULK OF THE 
UNITED KINGDOM SUNSHINE AND 
SHOWERS WE HAVE HAD SOME RAIN WE 
HAVE ALSO HAD SOME SHOWERS AND 
CURRENTLY WE HAVE GOT RAIN ACROSS 
THE NORTH EAST OF 
SCOTLAND THAT 
IS 
WHERE IT IS SNOWING 
NOT JUST 
ON 
HIGHER GROUND 
BUT ALSO TO LOWER 
LEVELS LOOKING AT SCOTLAND THERE 
IS QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD AROUND 
THERE IS SOME SUNSHINE AROUND 
ABERDEENSHIRE WE HAVE SOME SNOW 
THEN FURTHER SHOWERS AROUND THE 
BORDERS AND THE NORTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND HEADING OFF IN THE 
DIRECTION OF LINCOLNSHIRE SOUTH OF 
THAT GOOD BREAKS IN THE CLOUD AND 
WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME SUNNY SKIES 
IT IS NIPPY IF YOU ARE STANDING 
AROUND WAITING FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
FOR DEGREES IN SOUTHAMPTON AND 
THREE IN PLYMOUTH THROUGH THE 
MORNING THERE WILL BE LITTLE BITS 
OF CLOUD AROUND THE SAME 
FOR WALES 
BUT A LOT OF SUNSHINE AS 
WE PUSH 
UP 
INTO THE 
NORTH 
OF WALES 
AND 
ANGLESEY WE ARE BACK INTO THE 
SHOWERS AND 
THE SAME FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND SOME 
SHOWERS THIS MORNING 
BUT ALSO SOME SUNSHINE THE 
FORECAST FOR TODAY REALLY IS THAT 
SUNSHINE 
AND SHOWERS 
THE SHOWERS 
IF ANYTHING A BIT LIGHTER THAN 
YESTERDAY ALSO FURTHER AND FEWER 
BETWEEN BUT THROUGH THE AFTERNOON 
YOU MAY FIND THEY WILL 
BE SOME 
HEAVY ONES IN PARTS OF EASTERN 
ENGLAND IN THE SUNSHINE 
TEMPERATURES RESPONDING WE ARE 
LOOKING AT ABOUT SEVEN TO THIRTEEN 
DEGREES CELSIUS THEN THROUGH THE 
SEETHING AT THE OVERNIGHT MANY OF 
THE SHIRES WILL 
DIE AWAY 
A 
BAND 
OF RAIN 
SHOWS ITS HAND ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND INTO WESTERN 
SCOTLAND WHERE AGAIN 
ON HIGHER 
GROUND WE WILL 
HAVE SOME 
SNOW WE 
ALSO HAVE 
SOME RAIN 
APPROACHING THE 
NORTH WEST 
OF ENGLAND 
AND ALSO 
WALES IT 
IS 
GOING TO 
BE 
A COLD 
NIGHT WITH 
SOME FROST 
FIRST THING 
IN THE MORNING IT 
DO S. 
MEAN 
WHETHER CRAGG HAS BROKEN WE WILL 
HAVE SOME BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINE THE 
RAIN BAND 
COMING 
IN FROM 
THE 
THROUGH THE DAY 
WILL TURN 
MORE 
SHOWERY IN NATURE AS 
IT MOVES 
EASTWARDS AND THEN TOMORROW ONCE 
AGAIN WE 
ARE LOOKING 
AT 
THE DAY 
OF 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS AND A MAXIMUM 
TEMPERATURE OF FOURTEEN CELSIUS BACK TO 
YOU TOO 
HAVE YOU EVER TASTED A KING OF THE 
RIDGE CUCUMBER OR GRAVEDIGGER PEA 
IT IS PRETTY UNLIKELY UNLESS YOU 
GROW YOUR 
OWN 
VEGETABLES BECAUSE 
YOU 
WILL NOT 
FIND THEM IN YOUR 
LOCAL SUPERMARKET 
THEY ARE JUST 
TWO OF 
THE MANY VARIETIES OF 
BRITISH VEGETABLES 
THAT ARE 
IN 
DANGER OF DYING OUT 
AS MODERN 
AGRICULTURE 
GROWS FEWER 
AND FEWER 
SPECIES SO HOW CAN 
PRESERVE SOME OF OUR RARER VEG 
AWARD WINNING GARDENER YOU WILL 
REMEMBER HER PERHAPS AS A SINGER 
KIM WILDE IS HERE LOVELY TO SEE 
IT IS LOVELY TO BE HERE THE SUN IS 
OUT IT IS VERY EXCITING ALL THE 
GARDENERS OUT THERE THINKING GET 
PLANTING SOME SEAS 
EXCUSE THE 
IGNORANCE IT IS PLANTING TIME NOW 
IS IT 
ABSOLUTELY AND SPRING IS A 
TRADITIONAL TIME TO PLANT SEEDS 
I'M INVOLVED IN A DIG YOUR DINNER 
CAMPAIGN PERHAPS WE ARE A NATION 
OF GARDENERS BUT PERHAPS THERE ARE 
PEOPLE OUT THERE WATCHING WHO HAVE 
NEVER PLANTED A SEED PERHAPS THIS 
SPRING THEY COULD DO SO IF I CAN 
DO IT ANYONE CAN DO IT 
WHAT IF 
THEY HAVEN'T GOT A GARDEN 
YOU CAN 
PLANT IN CONTAINERS YOU CAN GROW 
TOMATOES AND HERBS INSIDE ON A 
WINDOWSILL THE DIG YOUR DINNER IS 
FLAGGING UP SOME VARIETIES IN 
DANGER OF BECOMING EXTINCT THESE 
VARIETIES ARE LIVING ANTIQUES THEY 
HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR GENERATIONS 
ALTHOUGH YOU CAN BUY THEM IN YOUR 
LOCAL NURSERIES AER LIMB FRIDAYS 
THERE ARE A NUMBER THAT ARE 
ACTUALLY IN DANGER OF BECOMING 
EXTINCT HEIRLOOM VARIETIES 
THERE IS A TYPE OF P. WHICH 
ORIGINATES IN LUTON A VARIETY OF 
PEACE 
IT HAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND IT DOES 
WELL IN LUTON SO IT SHOULD GROW IN 
MY GARDEN L. RECEIVED THE SEEDS 
FROM GARDEN ORGANIC WHO ARE THE 
U. K.'S LEADING ORGANIC GROWING 
CHARITY THAT IS THE ONLY WE CAN 
GET THE SEEDS BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT 
ON NATIONAL 
S. D. 
LIST 
SO YOU 
HAVE 
TO BECOME 
A MEMBER 
OF 
ORGANIC IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THESE 
BUT TO SUPPORT SEEDS THAT ARE IN 
DANGER OF BECOMING EXTINCT YOU 
SHOULD SUPPORT HEIRLOOM VARIETIES 
ARE THEY EASY TO GROW AS WELL YOU 
HAVE ONIONS THERE THAT IS NOT 
SOMETHING I WOULD NATURALLY THINK 
OF PLANTING IN MY GARDEN BECAUSE IT 
IS QUITE SMALL 
BUT OUR 
MEANS EASY 
TO GROW 
THEY ARE L. ALWAYS SAY IF 
I CAN DO IT CAN ANYONE CAN DO IT L. 
WILL PROBABLY BE SELLING INSIDE WHEN 
I GET 
HOME TODAY AND 
THEN I WILL PUT THEM AT LIKE WE 
ALL KNOW ABOUT PUTTING PLANTS OUT 
AFTER THE FORCE AT THE END OF MAY 
BUT YOU CAN USUALLY DIRECTLY SO 
SOME APART IN RAISED BEDS AND A 
WARM UP QUICKER 
IF WE DON'T FEEL 
GREEN FINGERED WE WONDER IS THE 
SOIL RIGHT 
IS THE LIGHT RIGHT IT IT IS A VAST SUBJECT ALSO I WOULD SAY 
WITH THE CAMPAIGN WHY NOT START 
SMALL QUESTION OF WHEN I STARTED I 
REALLY JUMPED IN THE DEEP END 
AND I 
PLODDED EVERYTHING IN SIGHT AND IT 
WAS OVERWHELMING GREAT FUN L. WOULD SAY START OF SMALL PICK 
THREE SEATS THAT YOU LIKE THE LOOK 
OF AND IF YOU FANCY GROWING 
PEAS OR SOME SALAD LEAVES WHICH 
WILL GROW WELL IN CONTAINERS 
OUTSIDE YOUR KITCHEN DOOR 
A YOU 
CAN'T GO TO WRONG PLANTING SEEDS 
THE WORLD WILL NOT END IF THEY SEE 
DOES NOT COME UP OR SLOW EXIT ONCE 
YOU SO SEED I DEFY ANYONE 
HAVING DONE IT ONCE DO NOT FEEL 
MOTIVATED TO DO IT AGAIN IF THEY 
GO TO THE DIG YOUR DINNER WEBSITE 
THEY CAN GO LOTS OF GREAT 
TIPS ON 
HOW 
TO GET 
STARTED THIS SPRING WE 
WE HAVE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT 
PAVING 
FRONT GARDENS 
WHICH WOULD 
SEEM A 
PITY FOR YOU WOULD IT 
IT WOULD 
PROMOTING A SPACE FOR WILDLIFE TO 
ENCOURAGE WILDLIFE WHICH HELPS THE 
GARDEN GARDENING ORGANICALLY 
GARDENING WITH PLANTS AND CREATING 
LITTLE HAVENS FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT 
WE ARE A NATION THAT CAN REALLY 
MAKE A BIG IMPACT ON THE NATION'S 
HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT JUST IN OUR 
LITTLE GARDENERS 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK 
BACK FOR A MOMENT TO A FORMER 
CAREER YOU HAD A RECORD WITH A 
RECORD IN THAT YOU WERE UNTIL 
RECENTLY THE LAST FEMALE BRITISH 
ARTIST TO HAVE A NUMBER ONE IN 
AMERICA WITH THE KIDS IN AMERICA 
THERE YOU ARE LEONA LEWIS HAS 
OVERTAKEN YOU YOU HAVE THE SPOT 
FOR A TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
A LONG TIME LEONA LEWIS HAS TAKEN 
OVER THE MANTLE FROM YOU 
I THINK 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC FOR HER 
SHE IS SUCH A TALENT L. CAN'T THINK 
OF ANYONE BETTER TO TAKE THAT 
MANTLE AWAY FROM ME 
IT PROVES HOW 
DIFFICULT IT IS THAT IT HAS TAKEN 
ALONG FOR BRITISH FEMALE ARTIST TO 
DO IT DOESN'T IT 
IT DOES THE 
MARKET WAS BACK WAS VERY 
DIFFERENT WHEN I HAD THAT HIT L. 
THINK IT WAS NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE OR NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR L. DON'T THINK THE AMERICANS GENERALLY GOT 
THAT EIGHTY SOUND BUT I THINK OUR 
MARKETS HAVE MERGED A LOT MORE NOW 
THOSE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 
AMERICAN AND BRITISH MUSIC SCENE 
HAVE GOT SMALLER 
THE ONE I ALWAYS 
REMEMBER HIS KIDS IN AMERICA

INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL RIGHT 
TO GO RIGHT BACK TO THE PLOT OF THE FILM IT'S 
BASED ON SOMETHING THAT REALLY 
HAPPENED ISN'T IT 
YEAH THESE M. I. T. 
STUDENTS IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S 
BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE SEVENTIES AT M. I. T. 
THIS WAS ONE PARTICULAR CASE WHERE 
THEY REALLY DID EARN AN INCREDIBLE 
AMOUNT OF MONEY M. IT'S A TRUE 
STOERL THEY WENT TO VEGAS THIS AT 
THE WENT TO VEGAS WITH ALL THIS 
CASH AND THEY DID LEARN A KIND OF 
CARD COUNTING SYSTEM PUT IT INTO 
PRACTICE AND EARNED MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS 
YOU TALK TO WHEN YOU WERE DOLLARS PREPARING FOR THE MOVIE TO THE GUY 
INVOLVED IN THAT

HE WAS A BIG PART OF THE WHOLE 
PROCESS IT WAS A VERY 
COLLABORATIVE THING ALL THE M. I. T. 
STUDENTS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE 
STORY WE WERE TELLING CAME ON TO 
THE SET AND HUNG OUT THEY WERE 
LOVING THE FACT THAT WE WERE MAKING 
A FILM ABOUT THEIR LIVES 
IT'S A FASCINATING IDEA EVERYBODY 
WANTS TO BEAT THE SYSTEM SAYING I 
COULD DO THAT BUT COUNTING CARDS 
IT HARD DID YOU TRY IT 
I LEARNT 
THE HARD WAY ONLY BECAUSE WE WERE 
SORT OF SENT OFF INTO THE CASINOS 
WITH UNFORTUNATELY OUR OWN MONEY

WERE IN ANY WAY MATHEMATICALLY 
GIFTED WE LEARNT QUICKLY IT'S NOT 
EASY 
YOU KEEP A TRACK OF THE FACE EASY CARDS THE IMPORTANT CARDS WHERE 
THEY COME UP OR NOT IN ESSENCE 
EXACTLY THE MORE FACE CARDS AND 
TEN CARDS AND HIGH CARDS LEFT IN 
THE DECK THE BETTER CHANCE THAT'S 
WHEN YOU START BEING BIG AND THE 
BETTER CHANCE YOU HAVE OF WINNING 
YOU LOST YOUR OWN MONEY YOU HAD TO 
SPEND QUITE A LOT OF TIME IN LAS 
VEGAS

RICH CLOTHES AND ALL THAT SORT OF 
THING

PLACE IT'S DESIGNED TO TAKE YOUR 
MONEY FROM YOU IN EVERY WAY 
POSSIBLE ON ALL THE CASINO FLOORS
