IN A FEW MINUTES LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
AT THE FIRST OF OUR FIVE LIVE RACES 
ON THE B. B. C. THIS THIS TEN TO GO IN OUR FIRST THIS IS HOW 
THEY BET LION SANDS IS THE FIVE TO TWO 
FAVOURITE IVY CREEK SEVEN TO TWO SPANISH 
MOON AT FIVE TO ONE CLASSIC PUNCH IS AT SEVEN 
ONE OPERA MUNDI AT NINES SO LION SANDS THE FAVOURITE FOR 
LUCA CUMANI AND JAMIE SPENCER ON 
BOARD LUCA CUMANI BROAD THIS HORSE 
HIMSELF AND HE HAD DECENT ENOUGH 
SEASON LAST SEASON HE WON TWO OF 
HIS FIVE STARTS 
YES HE IS A HORSE 
THAT IS IMPROVING ALL THE TIME AND 
LUCA IS GOOD AT THIS HE GETS 
HORSES TO IMPROVE YOU CAN SEE 
JIMMY THERE HE LOOKS LIKE A 
NATIONAL HUNT JOCKEY THERE 
WHY DO 
YOU SAY THAT 
BECAUSE THE HORSE I WOULD CALL HIM 
SMALL A SMALL COMPACT HORSE HE 
HAS TAKEN THEM DOWN LAST SO HE 
MIGHT BE EAGER TO GET ON WITH 
THINGS BUT KNOWING LUCA THIS 
HORSE WILL IMPROVE HE HAS THE 
FAMOUS AMERICAN COLOURS ON THEY 
WON SOME CLASSICS IN AMERICA LET'S 
MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT CONTENDER THIS 
IS CLASSIC PUNCH SPEAKING OF 
BREEDING ILY WHICH I KNOW YOU KNOW 
A LOT ABOUT 
PERSIAN PUNCH'S HALF 
BROTHER I AM AFRAID HE HASN'T GOT 
CONSISTENCEY OF PERSIAN PUNCH HE 
IS A NICE HORSE HE HAS 
DISAPPOINTED HERE WHEN HE WAS IN 
THE CUMBERLAND LODGE HE FINISHED 
SIX I KNOW WHEN YOU GO BACK TO THE 
DERBY THE TRAINER THOUGHT HE WAS 
GOING TO BE A DERBY WINNER HE HAS 
DISAPPOINTED HIM AND HE HAS BEEN 
SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTING SO MAYBE 
NOW THAT HE IS A FOUR YEAR OLD AND 
HE STARTS GETTING INTO STAYING 
RACES HE MIGHT EMULATE SOME OF WHAT 
HIS BROTHER DID DAVID ELSWORTH 
HIS TRAINER ALSO TRAINED PERSIAN 
PUNCH HERE IS NUMBER TWO IVY 
CREEK THIS ONE SUPPORTED WAS SIX TO ONE 
IN TO SEVEN TO TWO TRAINED BY ANOTHER MAP 
WHO IS ABLE TO GET HORSES TO 
IMPROVE AS HE GETS OLDER HE WAS 
FOURTH ON HIS FIRST RUN IN THE JOHN 
PORTER STAKES AT NEWBURY 
IT WAS 
SOFT GROUND SO WE HAVE DIFFERENT 
CONDITIONS UNDERFOOT FOR THIS HORSE 
TODAY WHICH WILL POSSIBLY HELP HIM 
HE HAS HAD THE BENEFIT OF THAT RUN 
HE WILL BE FIT FOR EXPLOITS SO HE 
WILL BE POSSIBLY THERE AT THE 
FINISH OR THEREABOUTS 
SPANISH MOON 
HAS ONLY HAD TWO STARTS IN HIS 
CAREER HE IS FOUR YEARS OLD HE 
HAS HAD SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS BUT 
SIR MICHAEL STOUTE NEVER KEEPS A 
HORSE IN TRAINING UNLESS HE 
BELIEVES HE HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER 
HIS RECORD SAYS SO THIS RACE IS A 
GOOD RACE TO BE WATCHING FOR THE 
FUTURE SOME OF THESE HORSES 
POSSIBLY WILL IMPROVE FROM WHAT 
THEY DID AS THREE YEAR OLDS IT 
WOULD BE A RACE THAT SOME OF THE 
HORSES MIGHT GO ON AND DO A LOT 
BETTER THAN THEY HAVE DONE IN THE 
PAST PAST HERE IS A QUICK LOOK AT THE BETTING 
THE FAVOURITE WAS LION SANDS HE WAS 
JUST EASING A LITTLE BIT DON'T 
FORGET THAT TUNGSTEN STRIKE I LIKE BIG ROBERT EACH WAY AT TWENTY TO ONE 
LET'S JOIN JIM MCGRATH FOR THE 
FIRST THAT IS SPANISH MOON RYAN MOORE 
WHO IS OUT TO REGAIN HIS TITLE THIS 
SEASON HE ALREADY HAS THIRTY WINNERS 
ON THE BOARD RYAN HE IS RIDING IN 
FANTASTIC FASHION AT THE MOMENT 
HIS COMBINATION WITH SIR MICHAEL 
STOUTE IS A FORMIDABLE ONE NOW 
THEY ARE READY FOR THE FIRST AT 
ASCOT THEY ARE RACING AWAY TO A 
GOOD START TOO IN THE CENTRE 
CLASSIC PUNCH IS AWAY SMARTLY JUST 
A BIT SLOW INTO STRIDE MUNSEF BACK

MADE UP HIS GROUND WELL ON THE 
INSIDE IN THE ORANGE CAP AS THEY

WOULD PROBABLY LIKE IT LONGER THAN 
A MILE AND A HALF HE IS ENJOYING 
HIMSELF AT THE MOMENT HE LEADS BY 
TWO LENGTHS TO CLASSIC PUNCH UP IN 
THIRD IS PETARA BAY ON THE OUTSIDE 
THEN ON THE INSIDE IN FOURTH IS 
HANELLA FOLLOWED FURTHER BACK BY 
YOUNG MICK TRAVELLED ON THE OUTSIDE 
OF IVY CREEK THEY ARE FOLLOWED

HAS THIS BEAUTIFULLY POSITIONED ON 
THE INSIDE FURTHER BACK IN THE 
FIELD IS IVY CREEK FROM BIG ROBERT 
SPANISH MOON AND MUNSEF CONTINUING 
THEIR CLIMB TOWARDS HOME NOW THEY 
HAVE OVER A HALF A MILE TO TRAVEL 
IT'S STILL TUNGSTEN STRIKE IN FRONT 
BY A LENGTH AND A HALF NOW TO IN 
SECOND CLASSIC PUNCH FOLLOWED BY 
PETARA BAY SPANISH MOON TAKEN OUT 
SHARPLY TO THE OUTSIDE HE HAS LOST 
GROUND IVY CREEK HAS BROKEN DOWN 
IVY CREEK HAS BROKEN DOWN 
UNFORTUNATELY AS THEY TURN FOR

FOR MUNSEF AND PETARA BAY FURTHER 
BACK IN THE FIELD WAS CLASSIC PUNCH 
AND LAST TO FINISH IS HANELLA WHAT 
A RIDE THAT WAS YOU SAW HOW 
AWKWARDLY HE CAME AROUND THE TURN 
IT WOBBLED WIDE IVY CREEK WAS THE 
ONE THAT BROKE DOWN HE HAD TO 
SWITCH RYAN MOORE OF COURSE THAT 
FORCED HIM WIDE LOOK AT HIM HE 
HAS COME DOWN THE INSIDE HE GOT UP 
AND WON TIED SECOND MUNSEF ON THE 
INSIDE MAYBE JUST AHEAD OF PETARA 
BAY IT'S A PHOTO THOUGH THEN IN 
FOURTH IS TUNGSTEN STRIKE IN FIFTH 
IS LION SANDS A GAP THEN TO BIG 
ROBERT THEN CLASSIC PUNCH 
FOLLOWED BY YOUNG MICK THEN A GAP 
OF SEVERAL LENGTHS TO THE OTHERS A 
LONG LONG WAY BACK AND THERE IS 
HANELLA WHO IS TOWARDS THE REAR L. 
WOULD SAY AT ONE STAGE RYAN MOORE 
WAS DESPAIRING HE WOULD BE ABLE TO 
GET AT THESE LEADERS BECAUSE IT 
TOOK A LONG TIME FOR SPANISH MOON 
TO ACTUALLY GET INTO FULL FLIGHT 
BUT ONCE HE DID HE DID MAKE GROUND 
VERY RAPIDLY AND HAS GOT UP HE WON 
WELL IN THE END HE WOBBLED WIDE 
HE WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO LAST COMING 
AROUND THAT TURN BUT HE HAS MADE 
UP AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF GROUND TO 
WIN SO THE WINNER IS NUMBER NINE 
SPANISH MOON RYAN MOORE SECOND 
NOW WE ARE WAITING FOR THE PHOTO 
STILL A PHOTO FOR SECOND IT'S 
BETWEEN MUNSEF AND PETARA BAY WE 
WILL BRING THAT TO YOU AS SOON AS 
WE GET IT FURTHER BACK IS TUNGSTEN 
STRIKE WHO WAS FOURTH FIRST OF ALL 
WE MUST TELL YOU NEWS OF IVY CREEK 
WHO BLOKE DOWN BEFORE ENTERING THE 
HOME STRAIGHT WHEN WE GET IT JIM 
WAS IMPRESSED BY THIS PERFORMANCE 
BY SPANISH MOON L. THINK IT WAS 
STUNNING CONSIDERING HE GOT 
HAMPERED LOOK HOW MUCH GROUND HE 
HAD TO MAKE UP 
HE WENT STEADY 
TUNGSTEN STRIKE HIS BROTHER 
DISTANCE IS GETTING ON O. FOR TWO 
MILES HE MADE THE RUNNING WENT 
STEADY AND WOUND UP THE PACE 
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE RACE IT WAS A 
PROGRESSIVE SORT OF A GALLOP AS 
YOU SAY HE HAS DONE VERY WELL 
THIS LOOKS TO ME LIKE THIS HORSE 
IS POSSIBLY GETTING ON FOR A GROUP 
TWO PERFORMANCE THERE THERE IS A 
LOT OF HORSES PETARA BAY WHO HAS 
FINISHED THIRD AND MUNSEF WHO 
FINISHED SECOND THAT IS CONFIRMED 
THESE ARE HORSES THAT HAVE BEEN 
RUNNING IN VERY GOOD COMPANY IF 
YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION HOW 
MUCH HE WAS INTERFERED WITH THIS 
IS A VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE A A STUNNING PERFORMANCE L. WOULDN'T BE 
SURPRISED IF HIS NEXT RUN WOULD BE 
AT THE HARDWICK STAKES AT ROYAL 
ASCOT NEXT MONTH RYAN MOORE HAD TO 
PERFORM MINOR MIRACLES TO GET THERE 
RYAN MOORE'S THIRTY FIRST WINNER OF THE 
CAMPAIGN SEVEN TO TWO SPANISH MOON MUNSEF 
TEN TO ONE PETARA BAY TWENTY TO ONE SIR MICHAEL 
STOUT A WINNER SIR MICHAEL STOUTE 
A WINNER FREMANTLE HAVING WON THE 
CHESTER VASE IN CHESTER ALSO THE 
WINNER OF THE DEE STAKES YESTERDAY 
AT CHESTER WAS AN EYE CATCHER 
TAJAWEED SO RYAN IS JUST 
EXPLAINING TO SIR MICHAEL THAT THE 
HORSE DID WELL TO STAY ON HIS FEET 
THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THAT IVY CREEK 
INCIDENT UNFORTUNATELY IVY CREEK 
APPEARS TO HAVE BROKEN DOWN THE 
TIME WAS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY POINT EIGHT SEVEN IT'S THREE 
SECONDS OUTSIDE THE RECORD HERE AT 
ASCOT HE ABSOLUTELY FLEW HE IS A 
GOOD STAYER THERE IS SIR MICHAEL 
HE WILL BE QUITE HAPPY WITH THE WAY 
THINGS ARE PROGRESSING THIS WEEK 
LION SANDS WAS DISAPPOINTING L. 
THOUGHT HE HAD HIS CHANCE JAMIE 
SPENCER HAD HIM IN A GOOD POSITION 
BUT DIDN'T PICK UP AS WELL AS 
EXPECTED RYAN MOORE A NICE ONE TO 
GET ON THE BOARD WAS IT THE 
INDIFFERENCE OF THE HORSE THAT 
CAUSED TO YOU GO WIDE 
MY HORSE WAS 
A BIT OF A FREAKY PERFORMANCE HE 
BROKE DOWN WE SWITCHED AROUND IN 
TIME AND OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT OF 
A BABY HE TOOK A WHILE AND WHEN HE 
QUICKENED UP HE WAS GOING TO WIN 
HE HAD A LOT TO DO WE SAW GOING 
WIDE BUT YOU STILL HAD TO GO AND 
DO IT 
IT WAS A MIRACLE TO WIN FROM 
THAT FAR BACK HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A 
HORSE WITH A LOT OF ABILITY 
HOPEFULLY HE WILL STAY SOUND NOW 
AND WE WILL HAVE A CLEAR RUN ON ON THE GROUND 
ON THE FAST SIDE LET'S LET'S SEE IF WE CAN TALK TO MICHAEL STAUT 
YOUR REACTION TO THAT YOU SAID YOU 
MISSED IT LIKE A BEE FOOTBALL MANAGER 
I CHANGED FROM THE SCREEN MANAGER ON TO MY BINOCULARS NEXT THING I 
NOTICED WAS RYAN VERY WIDE HE DID 
WELL TO WIN FROM THERE 
PLANS FOR 
HIM 
WE HAVE HIM IN THE HARDWICK HIM THAT COULD BE A POSSIBILITY 
I KNOW 
YOU ARE BUSY QUICKLY ON THE DERBY 
FRONT TAJAWEED AND FREMANTLE 
TAJAWEED I FELT RAN A GOOD TRIAL 
YESTERDAY I HAVEN'T CONFIRMED WITH 
ANGUS WHETHER HE WILL GO TO ENSOMP 
I PROZUM HE DOES DOCTOR FREMANTLE I 
THINK WE WILL WAIT AND SEE CHANCE 
IN THE DANTE 
YOU DO HAVE SOME UNRACED ONES 
TARTEN BARER MAY HE GOING TO THE 
DANTE DANTE HE WON A MAIDEN AT LEICESTER LAST 
YEAR AND HE IS GOING FOR THE DANTE 
I MEANT UP RACED 
HE WON AT 
LEICESTER END OF APRIL 
AT THIS 
STAGE WHICH OF THOSE THREE WOULD 
BE SUITED BY THE DOWNHILL PLUNGE AT 
TATTENHAM CORNER 
I THINK THE TWO 
CHESTER BOYS WOULD NOT BE 
INCONVENIENCEED AT EPSOM THAT IS 
FOR SURE 
THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US LET'S 
HAVE LOOK AT 
THE RESULT NOW OF THE FIRST EVENT SPANISH MOON AT SEVEN TWO WHAT A FANTASTIC FIRST RACE WE HAD 
I KNOW IT WAS DRA HATTIC WE WILL 
STILL BRING YOU NEWS ON IVY CREEK 
AS SOON AS WE GET IT IT WAS A 
TREMENDOUS FORMERANCE BY A HORSE ON 
JUST HIS THIRD START 
HE IS 
OBVIOUSLY AN IMPROVING ANIMAL AND 
ONE FOR THE FUTURE 
SIR MICHAEL STOUTE SAID THE 
HARDWICK STAKES 
YOU TIPPED THAT 
IT WAS STRAIGHT FORWARD 
HE IS A SADLER'S WELLS HORSE HE 
DEFINITELY WILL STAY 
LET'S GO BACK 
TO LAST SATURDAY WHEN IT WAS THE 
FIRST SKATS CLASSIC OF THE SEASON 
IN THIS COUNTRY FOR FORCE 
THE HORSE IN GREEN WAS THE UNBEATEN 
NEW APPROACH NEXT TO HIM 
HENRYTHENAVIGATOR RIDDEN BY JOHNNY 
MURTAGH FOR AIDAN O'BRIEN 
HE DID VERY WELL WHAT A GREAT 
START THEY HAVE HAD WINNING GROUP 
ONE RACES WINNING RACES GALORE 
WHEN THE BIG RACE COMES UP JONNIE 
MURTAGH IS DOING THE BUSINESS FOR 
THE BOYS IN THE DARK BLUE OR THE 
IRISH BOYS AS WE CALL THEM 
OBVIOUSLY NO KIERON FALLON AT THE 
MOMENT FOR THE O'BRIEN TEAM THEY 
HAVE REPLACED HIM WITH JOHNNY 
MURTAGH IT WAS IN THAT RACE THREE 
YEARS AGO THAT KIERON FALLON SEALED 
HIS RELATION WITH FOOTSTEPS IN THE 
SAND I EXCEPT ANOTHER FANTASTIC 
SEASON 
HE IS AN ULTIMATE SEASON PROFESSIONAL JONNIE MURTAGH HE IS 
WORLD CLASS JOCKEY HE FITTED IN 
JUST TAIL DOVEED INTO THE JOB 
COMPLETELY COMPLETELY HOW GOOD A GUINEAS WAS THAT THE THE FIRST TWO ARE VERY GOOD HORSES 
THEY LOOKED VERY GOOD THE SECOND 
OBVIOUSLY NEW APPROACH 
DISAPPOINTING HE IS NOT COMING TO 
THE DERBY JIM BOLGER OBVIOUSLY HAS 
REASONS FOR THAT L. BASICALLY WOULD 
MAKE HIM FAVOURITE FOR THE DERBY IF 
THEY WANTED TO COME HE HAS A 
PEDIGREE TO WIN THE DERBY BUT 
THERE IS A REASON BEHIND IT ALL HE 
IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK 
IT WAS A GOOD GUINEAS THIS HORSE

WOULD STAY A MILE AND A HALF IN THE 
HORSE BOX

I MUST ASK YOU ABOUT SIR MICHAEL 
STOUTE WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HIM 
TRAINING OLDER HORSES THIS HORSE 
WAS FOUR YEARS OLD AND HE WON WHY 
IS HE SO GOOD WITH OLDER HORSES 
BASICALLY IT ALL STARTS FROM THE 
WORD GO HE GIVES HIS HORSES PLENTY 
OF TIME HE NEVER RUSHES YOU NEVER 
SEE HIM WITH RUNNERS AT DONCASTER 
HE'S LUCKY IF 
IN MARCH YOU'RE YOU'RE LUCKY IF YOU GET A TWO YEAR OLD 
RUNNER IN JULY WHEN YOU SEND 
HORSE TO HIM BECAUSE HE SLOWLY 
BRINGS THEM ON VERY GRADUALLY HE 
GIVES THE HORSE PLENTY OF TIME TO 
SHOW WHAT HE IS THEN WHEN HE GETS 
A HORSE THAT POSSIBLY LIKE THAT 
HORSE WE JUST SAW THERE STAMINA 
FULLY LAIDEN STAMINA PEDIGREE HE 
HAS GIVEN THE HORSE PLENTY OF TIME

GOT THEM RIGHT HE DUPBLT OVERFACE 
THEM AND THN AT FOUR HE REEPS THE 
REWARDS 
HE'S VERY PATIENT HE LETS REWARDS THEM SHOW HIM WHEN THEY'RE READY 
HE DOES OF COURSE UNFORTUNATELY 
SOME OWNERS DON'T LIKE THAT BECAUSE 
THEY LIKE A QUICK RETURN BUT 
BASICALLY HE IS TRAINING FOR THE 
FOR WHAT YOU WOULD SAY THE CREAM OF 
OWNERS THE VERY WEALTHY OWNERS 
THAT CAN DO THAT OF COURSE THAT'S 
WHAT THEY ENJOY SEEING A HORSE 
COMING ON GRADUALLY AND WINNING ALL

PREPARATIONS ARE WELL UNDER WAY 
FRANKIE DETTORI'S DERBY WIN LAST 
YEAR DEFINED ONE OF THE DEFINING 
MOMENTS NEARLY TWELVE MONTHS ON 
ORGANISERS ARE HOTLY ANTICIPATING 
THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ADDITION

CONCERNED IT'S THE GREATEST FLAT 
RACE IN THE WORLD AND ONE OF THE 
BEST DAYS OUT IN THE WORLD WE'RE 
HOPING FOR A GREAT WINNER 
RACE GOERS WILL SEE DIFFERENT 
EPSOM THIS YEAR WITH WORK ON THE 
NEW GRANDSTAND ONGOING ALTHOUGH 
THE TOTAL CAPACITY WITH ONLY BE 
REDUCED BY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE NEXT MONTH 
THIS YEAR'S DERBY WAS LAUNCHED AT A 
GLITTERING PARTY IN LONDON WHERE 
THE THE GUEST OF HONOUR WAS SERENITYIAN 
FOR ME WINNING THE SERENITYIAN DERBY WAS THE FINAL JIGSAW THE 
DERBY THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS RACE 
WAS THE RACE I NEVER WON IN THE 
PAST FOR SO MANY YEARS I'VE BEEN 
TRYING AND FINALLY WE DO IT IN IN RECOGNITION OF DETTORI'S WIN HIS 
WIFE CATHERINE HAS BEEN NAMED THE 
FACE OF THIS YEAR'S FESTIVAL WHILE 
THE JOCKEY HAS HAD A POEM WRITTEN 
IN HIS HONOUR BY THE RACING BIRD 
HENRY BIRTHLES 
IT MEANT THE SAME 
TO US AS YOU OUR OWN AZUREY BOY 
FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR I'VE 
BEEN GOING TO EPSOM HOPEFULLY THE 
IT WILL BE ANOTHER WINNING DAY AND 
GET THE MONKEY OFF MY BACK NEXT 
YEAR FINGERS CROSSED I'LL DO IT 
AGAIN 
OTHERS SHARED THEIR MEMORIES AGAIN OF ONE OF RACING'S MOST CELEBRATED 
OCCASIONS 
IT WAS A VERY SPECIAL OCCASIONS DAY IN PEOPLE'S LIVES FLRP OPEN 
TOP BUSES THERE WERE OPEN TOP 
BUSES AROUND THE WHOLE COURSE IT 
WAS AMAZINGLY SPECIAL THIS IS WHAT 
HAS ENDURED WHILE AT THE SAME 
TIME THERE ARE MANY OTHER 
COMPETING SPORTS 
YOU'RE ASKING IF 
A HORSE HAS SPEED THAT IT HAS 
STAMINA AND ALSO INCREDIBLE BALANCE 
THAT MAKES IT SUCH AN ULTIMATE TEST 
AN ULTIMATE TEST THAT IS NOW JUST 
FOUR WEEKS AWAY 
IT WAS A GREAT DAY LAST YEAR AFTER 
FRANKIE WON ON AUTHORIZED WHAT'S 
HAPPENING IN THE DERBY PICTURE THIS 
YEAR IS TAKING ITS TIME TO SHAPE UP 
STEADY ON WILLIE DON'T BE 
SARCASTIC WE'VE PICKED COUPLE OF 
HORSES THE FIRST IS THE FAVOURITE 
FOR THE RACE AS THINGS STAND AT THE 
MOMENT TWICE OVER HE'S DUE TO RUN 
NEXT WEEK IN THE DANTE STAKES HE HE WON AT NEWLY MARKET 
AND RAVEN'S 
PASS A GOOD HORSE WE DON'T THINK 
HE STAYED 
THIS HORSE IS OUT OF A 
HALF SISTER TO THE DAILY MIRROR OF 
PASSAGE OF TIME SHE STAYED A MILE 
AND A HALF SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO 
SAY THIS HORSE AFTER WINNING THE 
CRAVEEN IT WAS A GREAT TRIAL FOR 
THE DERBY YOU WOULD HAVE TO THINK 
HE'LL BE BE THERE ABOUTS ON THE BIG 
DAY 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS DAY EARLIER TODAY I WAS SAYING THERE'S 
SOMETHING ABOUT HIM DOESN'T STRIKE 
ME AS A DERBY HORSE BUT WE'LL FIND 
OUT OUT NOW A HORSE THAT RAN EARLIER THIS 
WEEK THAT HAS PUT HIMSELF IN LINE 
FOR THE DERBY IS TAJAWEED HE'S 
TRAINED BY SIR MICHAEL STOUTE THE 
STABLE IS IN TERRIFIC FORM AND HE 
WON AT CHESTER 
HE DID HE'S A BIG 
HORSE AND THE TWO OF THE HORSES 
CAME FROM LAST AND SECOND LAST AT 
CHESTER RICHARD HILLS CAME FROM 
BEHIND THE OTHER HORSE THAT WAS A 
BETTER PERFORMANCE POSSIBLY THAN 
THE SECOND NO HE WON JUST GOT UP 
THERE WHEN IT COMES TO EPSOM HE'S 
A BIG HORLS HE TRAVELS SO WILL HE 
COME DOWN THE HILL AND IF HE DOES 
I WOULD PUT HIM UP AS BEING ONE OF 
THE BETTER OF SIR MICHAEL STOUTE'S 
HORSES 
SIR MICHAEL STOUTE OF HORSES COURSE HIS LAST DERBY WIN TO WIN 
AT CHESTER AND GO ON TO WIN THE 
DERBY CHRIS KIN NORTH LIGHT WON 
THE DANTE AND WENT ON TO WIN THE 
DERBY AND HE HAS TARTAN BEAR IN THE 
SAME COLOURS THOSE ARE JUST A FEW 
NAMES WE'RE PUTTING IN THE POT FOR 
THE STAGE ANOTHER ONE IS CURTAIN 
CALL OUR FIRST FLAT MEETING OF THE 
YEAR WAS AT NOTTINGHAM HE WON THAT 
DAY HE WAS DUE TO RUN AT LINGFIELD 
TODAY BUT HE'S NOT RUNNING BECAUSE 
THE GROUND IS TOO FAST JAMIE 
SPENCER IS RIDING HIM WHAT ARE 
YOUR IMPRESSIONS OF CURTAIN CALL 
THIS IS TYPICAL DERBY PEDIGREE 
HORSE BY SADLERS WELLS THE DAILY 
MIRROR IS HALF SISTER OF HER IN 
AN DOUGH HE FINISHED THREE LENGTHS 
BEHIND NEW APPROACH LAST YEAR AS A 
TWO YEAR OLD HE ONLY HAS TWO 
LENGTHS AS A TWO YEAR OLD TO 
IMPROVE THIS HORSE IS THE ONE IF 
HE ONLY RAN AT NOTTINGHAM HE WON 
VERY VERY EASILY INDEED BUT IT'S 
A SHAME THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 
PART IN THE RACE 
WE'RE HEARING 
FROM HIS TRAINER CUMANI THAT HE'S 
UNLIKELY TO RUN AGAIN BEFORE THE 
DERBY WE'LL SEE HIM THIS SEASON 
JUST THE ONCE AT NOTTINGHAM 
TWICE OVER HAS BEEN THE FAVOURITE 
SO SOMETIME NOW 
WASHINGTON IRVING AND 
HENRYTHENAVIGATOR THE PEAR PAIR 
OF THEM TRAINED BY AIDEN O'BRIEN 
OUR NEXT RACE ONLY A FEW MINUTES 
AWAY WITH ME IS TRAINER ED VAUGHAN 
MEDICEA SIDERA QUITE A HISTORY 
SHE CHIPPED HER KNEES 
YES QUITE 
BADLY AS A TWO YEAR OLD ABOUT TEN 
DAYS BEFORE I WAS DUE TO RUN HER 
SHE MISSED HER TWO YEAR OLD CAREER 
OBVIOUSLY 
I NOTICED THAT YOU GOT OBVIOUSLY ON KERRIN MCEVOY GOT ON AT THE WALK 
AND SHE SWEATS A LITTLE BIT THAT'S THAT'S HER SHE SWEATS UP IT'S IN THE 
FAMILY 
YOU'RE PROBABLY UP BY THE FAMILY FRONT YOU LIKE TO BE FIGHTING FOR 
IT 
YEAH I THINK THERE IS LACK OF IT PACE IN THIS RACE OBVIOUSLY I 
WOULD LIKE TO GET A LEAD IF AT ALL 
POSSIBLE BUT I COULDN'T REALLY SEE 
IT HAPPENING TODAY WE'RE GOING UP 
TO A MILE AS WELL THAT IS A BIG 
CONCERN BUT IF SHE GETS THE WORK 
HER WORK HAS BEEN VERY GOOD SHE'LL 
PUT BE A BIG PERFORMANCE 
GOOD LUCK 
THANK YOU 
HIGHLY COMPETITIVE THIS RACE 
THREE HAVE ENTRIES AT ROYAL ASCOT 
IN THE WINTER FOREST STAKES 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE RUNNERS 
AND RIDERS FRANY NORTON HAS PUT UP ONE POUND 
AND FRANY RETURNING AFTER A SIX 
WEEK ABSENCE DUE TO INJURY 
AND NOW THE BETTING THERE'S THE FAVOURITE JAMBORETTA 
SHE'S TRAINED BY SIR MICHAEL STOUTE 
SHE'S IN THE COLOURS OF CHEVELEY 
PARK STUD WHO WON THIS RACE LAST 
YEAR WITH HEAVEN SENT JAMBORETTA 
IS ODDS ON FAVOURITE SHE WON A 
HANDICAP LAST TIME WILLIE THAT 
WAS QUITE A COUPLE OF RUNS DOWN 
FROM WHAT SHE FACES TODAY I THINK 
A MUCH TOUGHER RACE 
SHE'S UP SEVEN 
POUND FOR THAT WIN BUT WE'VE JUST 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW SIR MICHAEL 
STOUTE BRINGS HIS HORSES ON THIS 
IS ANOTHER ONE LOOK AT HER SHE'S 
A DEN HILL FILLY BUT YOU WERE JUST 
SAYING IT'S THE LAST CROP OF THE 
DANEHILLS SHE'S A BIGISH FILLY 
OBVIOUSLY A BIG STRONG THAT'S WHY 
HE'S TAKING HER DOWN VERY STEADILY 
TO NOT LET HER GET INTO TOP GEAR L. 
WOULD SAY THAT SHE IS ONE THAT IS 
GOING TO IMPROVE AGAIN ON WHAT 
SHE'S ALREADY SHOWN US SHE'S 
LIGHTLY RACED AND OF COURSE WITH 
HER PEDIGREE SHE IS OBVIOUSLY GOING 
TO IMPROVE ON WHAT SHE'S DONE SO 
FAR SO EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE RACE 
IS GOING TO HAVE TO IMPROVE TO BEAT 
THIS FILLY 
ONE OF HER MAIN DANGERS IF THERE 
IS A DANGER IN THE RACE MAY WELL 
BE NUMBER FOUR FRAGRANCY TRAINED 
BY MICHAEL JARVIS JIM COULLY IS 
RIDING THIS AFTERNOON THIS IS A 
FILLY WHO SHOULD BE FINE ON THE 
GROUND SHE WAS IMPROVING TOWARDS 
THE END OF LAST SEASON SHE ENDED 
UP BY WINNING A HANDICAP ON HER 
FINAL RUN OF THE SEA SON L. THINK 
SHE STILL NEEDS TO IMPROVE A LITTLE 
BIT IF SHE'S TO BEAT JAMBORETTA 
SHE'S GOING TO SHE'S DEFINITELY 
GOING TO IMPROVE ON WHAT SHE'S DONE 
SO FAR SHE'S ANOTHER FILLY 
ANOTHER TRAINER VERY PATIENT WITH 
HIS HORSES EVERY TIME THEY RUN 
THEIR HORSES AT PLACES LIKE ASCOT 
YOU ALWAYS EXPECT THEM TO GIVE A 
GOOD SHOWING THEY WOULDN'T BE 
BRINGING THEM TO ASCOT FOR THIS 
GOOD PRIZE IF THEY DIDN'T THINK 
THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE A GOOD 
ACCOUNT OF THEMSELVES THEY COULD 
HAVE FOUND A RACE AT PLACES LIKE 
NORWICH AND PLACES BUT HE DOES 
THINK A BIT OF THIS FOLLY ONE ONE HORSE WHO LIKES THE GROUND IS 
VALRHONA WHEN SHE RAN ON HER LAST 
RUN IN APRIL CONNECTIONS THOUGHT 
THE GROUND WAS TOO SOFT SHE 
TRAVELLED WELL FOR A LONG WAY IN 
THAT RACE SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT 
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T GO ON THE GROUND 
AGAIN 
THEY DON'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT AGAIN DISTANCE SHE WANTS BECAUSE SHE'S 
DOWN FOUR FURLONGS SHE'S RUN IN A 
MILE AND A HALF RACE AND UP IN 
CLASS SHE'S DOWN IN DISTANCE AND 
UP IN CLASS WHICH NORMALLY TELLS 
YOU SIT AND WATCH 
SHE HAS NO 
WEIGHT SHE HAS SEVEN STONES THIRTEEN 
YES THAT'S TRUE BUT CLASS 
KASUMI FROM HUGHIE MORRISON L. 
BELIEVE HUGHIE'S WIFE RIDES THIS 
MARE OUT AT HOME THIS IS A HORSE 
AGAIN A TOUGHER RACES FOR HORSES 
LIKE JAMBORETTA YOUNG IMPROVING 
FILLIES WILL PROBABLY BE A LITTLE 
TOO SHARP FOR THEM 
COULD BE BUT 
LOOK AT WHAT A LOVELY TYPE SHE IS 
SHE'LL LOVELY THE GROUND 
LOVES THE 
GROUND LOOK AT HOW STRONG SHE IS 
SHE'S BUILT LIKE A SPEED HORSE 
SHE'S BUILT LIKE A SPRINER LOOK AT 
HER BIG STRONG SHOULDERS AND JONG 
BACKSIDE 
THIS IS A HORSE I LIKE A BACKSIDE LOT LOT BUT SHE'S NINE STONE 
SHE HAS A 
LOT OF WEIGHT 
A LOT OF WEIGHT 
I THINK RICHARD HUGHES WILL SUIT 
HER TWELVE TO ONE MIGHT BE BIG PRICE 
MIGHT BE WHEN SHE RAN LAST TIME IN 
A GROUP TWO IN DUBAI SHE WAS 
HAMPERED IN THAT OCCASION 
IT WAS 
ON DIRT I DON'T THINK THE DIRT 
SURFACE ALTHOUGH SHE'S WON ON THE 
ALL WEATHER THE DIRT SURFACE IN 
DUBAI IS DIFFERENT 
SHE IS A CLASS 
FILLY SO OBVIOUSLY SHE'S THE 
BENCH MARK HEERPL IF SHE COMES UP

WEIGHT TO CARRY IN NINE STONE TEN

BAHARAH BAHARAH GIVING GERARD BUTLER HIS NINTH 
WINNER OF THE CAMPAIGN 
THE TIME ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE POINT SIX OH JOCKEYS SAYING 
AFTER THE FIRST THE GROUND VERY 
MUCH ON THE FAST SIDE WHICH IS 
UNDERSTANDABLE ON THIS BLAZING HOT 
DAY IT'S ONLY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE OUTSIDE THE 
COURSE RECORD 
FOR A MILE 
THAT WAS MADE IN THE QUEEN SET IF 
THE QUEEN ANNE LAST CLASS YOU SAID CLASS WAS THE 
REASON SHE WAS DOING IT SHE'S 
ALONGSIDE THE THE OTHERS BUT 
BAHARAH THE BETTER TURN OF FOOT 
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY A REALLY NICE TYPE 
OF FILLY YOU WOULDN'T SEND AN 
ANIMAL ALL THE WAY TO DUBAI IN A 
GROUP TWO BASICALLY THIS IS A 
HANDICAP I KNOW IT'S A HERITAGE 
HANDICAP BUT SHE IS BY FAR THE BEST 
IN THE RACE DISAPPOINTED WITH 
JAMBORETTA OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T PICK 
UP HE SAT LAST AND DIDN'T PICK UP 
HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN SITTING ABOUT 
SIX LENGTHS OFF IN THE RACE AND GOT 
BEAT SIX LENGTHS SO OBVIOUSLY HE 
MADE NO GROUND THIS FILLY WHO 
WILL BE SITTING OUT IN THE BACK AS 
WELL BUT SHE DID PICK UP AND SHOWED 
HER CLASS TO COME THERE AND WIN THE 
RACE RICHARD HUGHES OBVIOUSLY 
HAS BEEN GETTING A BIT OF STICK 
LATELY BUT BASICALLY HERE HE IS 
A TOP CLASS JOCKEY HE GAVE THAT 
FILL WHY THERE A VERY NICE RIDE 
INDEED ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAD YOUR 
MONEY ON IT 
ABSOLUTELY IF YOU HAD 
YOUR MONEY ON IT YOU WOULD BE 
PATTING RICHARD HUGHES ON THE BACK 
THAT WAS A TERRIFIC PERFORMANCE BY 
BAHARAH SHE RAN IN DUBAI A COUPLE 
OF MONTHS AGO IN THE DUBAI WORLD 
CUP MEETING DISAPPOINTED THAT DAY 
BUT I DON'T THINK THE SURFACE WOULD 
REALLY HAVE SUITED HER SHE'S MUCH 
MORE AT HOME ON TODAY'S STRAIGHT 
MILE AT ASCOT 
SHE HAS AN ENTRY IN THAT 
WINDSOR FOREST AT THE ROYAL MEETING 
WE'LL SEE HOW SHE GETS ON THERE 
SHE'S A LOVELY FILLY AN ELUSIVE 
QUALITY OUT OF BAHR AND BAR HFRBGS 
H. FROM BAHR FROM MEMORY WAS A 
VERY GOOD TYPE 
AND ERIC PINCER HAS STABLES AND HAS 
DONE VERY WELL FROM HIS HOME BREADS 
D. BREDS THIS IS OUT OF A GENEROUS 
MARE OUT OF A DERBY WINNER RICHARD 
HUGHES TWENTY THIRD WINNER OF THE CAMPAIGN 
HE'S MADE A VERY BRIGHT START 
AFTER THE FRUSTRATION OF BEING 
LOCKED IN BEHIND OF THE ONE THOUSAND 
GUINEAS AND WIN OVER THE LINE WITH 
PLENTY TO GIVE 
THAT WAS BAD LUCK FOR HIM 
BUT THERE HE IS OR THERE SHE IS 
BAHARAH BAHARAH AND ERIC JUST BEHIND THERE HE 
ALWAYS WEARS AN ORANGE TIE ERIC 
THIS IS BECAUSE OF HIS IF HE 
COULD GO CLOSER ON ORANGE TIE ON 
RACE DAY HE ALWAYS WEARS IT HIS 
COLOURS ORANGE WITH BLACK HOOP AND 
WHITE CAP HERE'S RICHARDGERARD 
BUTLER HERE LOOKING VERY DAPPER AND 
COOL AND HAPPY 
INDEED I AM L. 
THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY GOOD 
PERFORMANCE CARRIED THAT WEIGHT 
AGAINST SOME NICE FILLIES RICHARD 
VERY PLEASED WITH HER HE GAVE HER 
A NICE CONFIDENT RIDE HOPEFULLY WE 
CAN COME BACK IN JUNE AND DO MORE 
DAMAGE 
WINTER FOREST 
THAT WOULD DAMAGE BE THE RACE FOR HER I THINK 
GERARD THIS FILLY GOT A TERRIBLE 
BATTERING IN DUBAI 
MURDERED ABOUT 
AFTER A FURLONG OR SO THAT PLUS 
THE TRACK ITSELF SHE DIDN'T HANDLE 
THE DIRT JAMIE WHO RODE HER WAS 
VERY KIND TO HER AND TOOK CARE OF 
HER SHE'S TRAINED WELL SINCE THEN 
THIS WAS A NICE STEPPING STONE TO 
GET HER BACK ON TRACK 
YOU'RE HALF 
SUPPORTING YOUR PRINCIPAL OWNER 
STILL WITH A SORT OF ORANGEY TIE 
WHEN DO YOU MOVE 
NEXT WEEK PLEASE 
GOD GOD TAKING A BIT LONGER THAN I FIRST 
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BUM IT'S ALL 
GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN BUT A FEW 
MORE DAYS AND WE SHOULD BE UP THERE 
TALKING TO ERIC PENSER YOU WILL 
MUST HAVE KNOWN HOARSES VERY YOUNG 
BECAUSE 
I RODE FOR YOU I DID I'VE 
HAD HORSES IN THE U. K. SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO AND 
IN SWEDEN SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR IT SHOWS I'M 
A AN OLD MAN THIS GIVES ME A LOT 
OF PLEASURE BECAUSE THIS IS THE 
FIRST HORSE I BOUGHT IN MY OWN NAME 
STKPWHRUF BRED A LOT OF GOOD 
WINNERS A LOT OF GOOD ONES AND A 
LOT OF USELESS ONES TOO 
GERARD IS

INTERESTED SO I WILL FIND A TENANT

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU 
IS THE RESULT OF THE BOVIS 
HOMES FILLIES' STAKES OVER A MILE LET'S TAKE A LOOK BACK AT THE 
PERFORMANCE OF JAMBORETTA THE 
FAVOURITE A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD 
HAVE BACKED HER LOOKING AT THE 
START OF THE RACE MANY PEOPLE MAY 
CONSIDER THAT RYAN MOORE DROPPED 
HER OUT OF THE BACK AT THE EARLY 
PART OF THE RACE THAT MIGHT HAVE 
COUNTED AGAINST HER WILLIE THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY HOW SHE WAS RIDDEN AT 
SANDOWN SO YOU GO OUT AND DO THE 
SAME THING AGAIN 
THE WINNER IS 
ALONGSIDE HER AS WELL ALONGSIDE ALONGSIDE HER HE'S JUST SITTING THERE AND 
NICELY SETTLED DOING EXACTLY WHAT 
HE DID AT SANDOWN OBVIOUSLY 
POSSIBLY THE RACE AT SANDOWN IS 
NOT AS GOOD AS WE POSSIBLY THINK IT 
IS 
SUBSEQUENTLY RYAN MOORE HAS IS REPORTED BACK TO US THAT THAT'S AS 
GOOD AS JAMBORETTA IS HE ALSO 
ADDED THAT PEOPLE MAY HAVE GOT 
CARRIED AWAY WITH THAT PERFORMANCE 
BECAUSE SHE RUN SO WELL ALSO ALSO SHE'S TRAINED BY MICHAEL STOUTE

LITTLE BIT MORE DISAPPOINTED FROM 
JAMBORETTA BUT WE'LL HOPEFULLY SEE

ABOUT THIS 
HE HAS WON SOME GOOD RACES HERE 
FRANCESCA CUMANI RAN HIM HERE THE 
COURSE SUITS HIM

DROP IN AND HOPE HE GOES TOO FAST 
AND RUN ON AND PICK HIM UP WELL WELL LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE RINERS AND 
RIDE FOERS THIS VICTORIA CUP IT'S

THESE HORSE LUCIFER 
BLEU AND KING OF DIXIE ARE WHAT WE

LIGHTLY RACED HE RAN THREE RACES 
OBVIOUSLY WELL EXPERIENCED L. HAVE 
ALWAYS LIKED HIM AND I HOPE THAT HE 
CAN STEP UP TO THIS GREY TODAY 
HE IS DRAWN IN STALL TEN ARE YOU 
HAPPY WITH THAT SPEAKING TO SOME 
OF THE JOCKIES THEY THINK HE WILL 
COME DOWN THE MIDDLE 
THAT WOULD BE 
IDEAL WE DON'T WANT THEM TO SPLIT 
AND GO EITHER SIDE ONE HOPES THEY 
CAN GO DOWN THE MIDDLE 
HOW WELL DO 
YOU GET ON WITH ED DUNLOP HE WAS 
MAKING MONKEY FACE AGAINST YOU 
THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME IT'S NICE 
TO RUN AGAINST THE OLD BOSS IF I 
CAN TURN HIM OVER THAT WOULD BE 
GREAT 
I AM HERE WITH ED DUNLOP A GREAT LOT OF BANTERS GOING ON HERE HAVE 
YOU AL KHALEEJ THE SEVEN HORSE 
VERY LATE TO LEG UP 
RYAN WAS KEEN 
TO GO DOWN LAST HE TENS TO BE KEEN 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE HE CAN GO DOWN 
LAST 
LIGHTLY RACED ANY REASON TO LAST FOR THIS 
HE HAS HAD A FEW PROBLEMS 
IN THE PAST HE SEEMS TO BE OVER 
THOSE HE RAN HIS FIRST RACE THIS 
YEAR IMPRESSIVELY HOPEFULLY HE 
WILL RUN WELL TODAY 
KEMPTON WAS PLEASE FOG YOU 
IT WAS GOOD GOOD TO ZEE HIM RUN 
WELL IT WASEN THE CLASS OF A RACE 
LIKE THIS HE IS THE SHORT PRICED 
FAVOURITE MY CONCERN IS THAT THE 
GROUND IS LIVELY ENOUGH L. WOULD 
HAVE LIKED IT TO HAVE BEEN BETTER 
THAN THIS 
AT KEMPTON PARK 
QUICKLY WENT THROUGH AND PUT A LOT 
OF DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE 
FOLLOWING HORSE BUT HIMSELF ALL 
OF A SUDDEN IS IT LENGTHS THE 
HANDICAPPER DIDN'T LIKE IT VERY 
MUCH HE WENT OFF NINE L. B. S. HE RAN WELL 
IT'S A DIFFERENT CLASS OF RACE NOW 
CERTAINLY WILL 
BEFORE WE GO TO THE RACE ITSELF 
RISHAWAY PERSAD WAS OUT TALENT 
SPOTTING HE CAUGHT UP WITH TWO 
FAMOUS JOCKEYS CAN YOU TELL THE 
DIFFERENCE RICHARD AND MICHAEL 
HILLS YOUR FATHER HASN'T TRAINED A 
WINNER OF THIS RACE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR 
IT'S DOWN TO YOU TWO TO END IT YOU 
ARE RIDING DABBERS RIDGE YOU HAD 
THE CHOICE OF GIGANTICUS OAR HIM 
WHY DID YOU GO FOR HIM 
HE HAS WON 
THIS YEAR AND THE OTHER HORSE HAS 
NEVER RUN IT WAS A HARD CHOICE L. 
WENT FOR THE HORSE THAT IS PROBABLY 
IN FORM AT THIS TIME OF YEAR 
RICHARD YOU ARE RIDING ZAAHID L. 
THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE HIS TRIP 
AND GROUND TODAY SEVEN FURLONGS 
REALLY SUITS HIM 
I THINK SEVEN HE 
HAS BEEN RUN OVER A MILE AND HE RAN 
A GOOD RACE AT NEWBURY BUT SEVEN 
HAS BEEN HIS BEST TRIP 
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK THE FIELD WILL CUP WILL THEY 
SPLIT OR COME DOWN THE MIDDLE 
I THINK THEY WILL COME DOWN THE 
MIDDLE 
I DO AS WELL THERE IS A MIDDLE LOT OF FANCYED HORSES THEY TEND TO 
GO TO THE MIDDLE MORE OFTEN THAN 
NOT 
WHICH ONE IS GOING TO END YOUR NOT DAD'S LONG WAIT FOR A WINNER WE WE HAVE THREE EQUAL CHANCES THE THE HILL'S BOYS HAVING A BIT OF FUN 
WITH ME BEFORE RACING THERE IS 
NUMBER SEVEN THIS HORSE WAS VERY 
IMPRESSIVE LAST TIMILY AT KEMPTON 
ON THE ALL WEATHER HE SEEMED TO BE 
KEEN BUT IT DIDN'T STOP HIM 
WINNING EASILY 
HE CAME FROM SECOND 
LAST ON THE TURN HE TRAVELLED 
THROUGHOUT THE RACE REALLY WELL HE 
LOOKS LIKE HE HAS IMPROVED OWE 
DIDN'T SAY WHY HE HAD IMPROVED BUT 
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE LIKES THE 
FAST SURFACE BUS THAT ALL WEATHER 
AT KEMPTON IT RIDES LIKE FIRMISH 
GROUND BASICALLY THE GROUND HERE 
TODAY SHOULD BE IN HIS FAVOURLY HE 
IS A HORSE THAT HAS BEEN PUT UP A 
FEW POUND FOR THAT RACE AT TEMP TON 
THIS IS UP IN GRADE IT'S A GOOD 
PRICE AND HE IS GOING TO GIVE A 
GOOD ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF IN A RACE 
LIKE THIS WHICH HORSE CAN BE SAY 
WILL WIN NONE OF THEM BUT YOU CAN 
POINT PEOPLE AND SAY THIS HORSE 
WILL BE THERE AT THE FINISH 
ONE OF 
THEM WILL WIN MAYBE IT MIGHT BE 
NUMBER THIRTEEN WE'LL COME WHO YOU WERE 
IMPRESSED WITH IN THE PADDOCK 
WASN'T HE LOVELY LOOK HOW HE IS 
SAUNTERING THERE HE LOOKS LIKE HE 
IS GOING AROUND THE RING AT HOME 
HE HAS A LAZY STRIDE AS WELL DURING 
THE RACE 
HE RAN A TERRIFIC RAISE 
BEHIND A HORSE IN JULY AT NEWMARKET 
ARGUABLY HIS SINGLE BEST PIECE OF 
FORM BUT HE HASN'T RUN SO FAR THIS 
SEASON NOT A QUESTION MARK COMING 
FROM MICHAEL JARVIS 
NOT COME 
MICHAEL JARVIS HE IS A BIG HORSE 
HE LOOKED QUITE FIT HIS RIBS ARE 
SHOWING WHICH IS SIGN HE WOULD BE 
FIT ENOUGH YOU HAVE DARYLL WHO IS 
RIDING VERY WELL AT THE MOMENT 
LEDGE LOOK AT HOW THEY BET GOOD EACH WAY SUPPORT FOR HUMUNGOS FOURTEEN TO ONE DOWN TO WELL WHAT ABOUT THE ONE THAT HAS 
BEEN BACKED THERE WILLIE WE'VE 
JUST TOUCHED ON HUMUNGOS WHO WAS 
BIG PRICE NOW DOWN TO SIXTEEN TO ONE 
THINK HE WON FURTHER THAN THIS IN 
SEVEN FURLONGS 
OBVIOUSLY THEY 
THINK HE'D BE ALL RIGHT HE'S BUY 
GIANT'S CAUSEWAY OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE 
THINKING HE GOES ON FIRM GROUND 
THE GROUND IS FIRM TODAY SO THEY 
THINK HE'S IN GOOD ORDER 
HE'S AT 
THE TOP END OF THE HANDICAPS YOU 
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE A 
BIT TOO MUCH WEIGHT OR CERTAINLY 
THE HANDICAPER HAS HIM UP TO HIS 
BEST BUT 
HE'S OVER THERE WITH 
THE BARRY HILLS HORSE AT EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN 
IN EACH STALLS THERE'S NUMBER NINE 
PRESUMPTIVE IT'S A HORSE THAT 
COULD PUT UP A BIG PERFORMANCE 
ROGER CHARLTON IT'S OWNED BY HIS 
STABLE ACTUALLY IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE 
STABLE HORSE HE'S PUT UP SOME VERY 
GOOD PERFORMANCES IN THE PAST HE 
WOULD GO ON THIS GROUND I'M SURE 
THIS FELLA COULD BE A HORSE THAT 
WOULD 
HE'S ANOTHER ONE YOU HAVE WOULD TO THROW INTO THE MIX AS WELL IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S A HANDICAP 
EVERYBODY WANTS TO WIN THIS RACE 
DON'T FORGET ABOUT MINE

SPECIALIST SEVEN FURLONG RACE A 
FEW POUND TOO MUCH IF YOU'VE GOT 
SOMETHING NOT QUITE RIGHT YOU'RE 
NOT GOING TO WIN THIS RACE NUMBER NUMBER FIVE MINE

CUP FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
A DRAMATIC RACE WE'LL TALK 
ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER INCIDENTS 
IN A MOMENT BUT LET'S PICK IT FROM 
TWO OUT AND FIND ZAAHID THE 
EVENTUAL WINNER THE HORSE WITH THE 
BIG WHITE FACE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
FIELD ALONGSIDE HIM IS AL KHALEEJ 
KING OF DIXIE MANAGED TO GET 
HIMSELF TO THE FRONT BUT THE TWO 
VERY WELL FANCIED HORSES RUN HIM 
DOWN CLOSE HOME 
THAT'S A BIG RUN 
BY THE THIRD BECAUSE HE DEFINITELY 
GOT LEFT THREE LENGTHS AND THERE HE 
WAS UP IN FRONT WITH TWO TO GO 
HE'S JUST GOT TIRED THERE AND 
POSSIBLY IF HE HADN'T GOT LEFT HE 
MIGHT HAVE WON THE RACE BUT TODAY 
IS RICHARD HILLS DAY ON ZAAHID AND 
YOUR TIP RISHI HAVE YOU GOT YOUR 
MONEY IN THE POCKET FOURTEEN TO ONE LOOKS 
GOOD NOW 
IT DOES 
RICHARD HILLS ENDS THE BARRY HILLS' 
WAIT THIRTY FOUR YEARS AGO HE WON THIS RACE 
BARRY HILLS SAID I SAID RICHARD 
IS THE BEST ONE OF YOU HE SAID 
I'D BE A BIT WORRIED ABOUT THE 
GROUND THAT WAS BEFORE THE RACE 
BUT OBVIOUSLY THE HORSE WHEN YOU 
RUN THEM FIRST TIME WILL GO OUT 
IT'S WHEN HE COMES OUT NEXT TIME HE 
MIGHT BE FEELING THE FIRM GROUND 
HE DID IT TODAY A BIG PRICE TO WIN 
SAKE HIS STALLION IS THE FATHER OF 
THIS HORSETHERE'S THE JOCKEY 
THAT'S ROBERT WINSTON RIDING L. A. A. 
RAYB 
NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM RAYB UNSEATED AT THE START LUCKILY 
ROBERT WINSTON IS O. K. HERE IT IS 
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH ROBERT 
WINSTON WINSTON OUT ON THE OUTSIDE 
THE HORSE TRIES TO BURROUGH 
UNDERNEATH THE STALLS AND ROBERT 
WINSTON IS LEFT STANDING ON THE 
SIDE OF THE STALLS AT THE END HE 
COULD DO VERY LITTLE ABOUT THAT I 
IMAGINE WITH THE HORSE TRYING TO 
GET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH 
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED THE HORSE 
HAS DUCKED HIS HEAD DOWN HE WAS 
GETTING HIS HORSE UNDERNEATH THE 
FRONT OF THE STALLS AND OBVIOUSLY 
ROBERT SAID I DON'T WANT TO BE 
GOING UNDERNEATH THE STALLS WITH 
THIS HORSE HE PUT HIS FOOT ON THE 
SIDE RAIL THE GATES HAVE OPENED AT 
THE FRONT TIME FOR HIM HE WILL 
HAVE BEEN STANDING ON THE SIDE AND 
WHEN THE GATES OPEN THE HORSE GOES 
LUCKILY L. A. A. RAYB KEPT AWAY FROM THE 
REST OF THE HORSES 
THE RULING I 
THINK POSSIBLY THE PEOPLE GET 
THEIR MONEY BACK 
NO HE'S A RUNNER 
HE'S GONE AND COME UNDER STARTERS' 
ORDERS SO THEREFORE HE'S A RUNNER 
SADLY IF YOU BACKED L. A. A. RAYB 
UNFORTUNATELY YOU LOST YOUR MONEY 
THERE'S THE WINNER ZAAHID THE 
WINNER OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TOTESPORT 
VICTORIA CUP 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT KING OF 
DIXIE WE WERE STAYING JUST HOW 
UNLUCKY HE WAS AT THE START LOOK 
FOR THE GREEN CAP RAISED JUST AS 
THE STARTER HITS THE BUTTON THERE 
YOU CAN SEE ROBERT WINSTON STANDING 
ON THE UPRIGHT AT THE FAR SIDE 
KING OF DIXIE IS NOT HAS NOT HAD 
THE CLEANEST OF STARTS AND HAS 
SHOWN A LOT OF COURAGE HE WOEN BE 
LONG IN WINNING A BIG ONE 
RICHARD HILLS IS WITH ME NOT EVEN 
OUT OF BREATH QUITE CLOSE BUT YOU 
WERE ALWAYS JUST HOLDING 
HE'S A 
REALLY VERY GENUINE HORSE THE 
GROUND TODAY I THOUGHT COULD BE 
QUICK FOR HIM BUT HE HAS GOT BETTER 
AND BETTER WHEN HE PUT HIS HEAD IN 
FRONT YOU KNOW THAT FEELING WITH A 
HORSE HE WAS NEVER GOING TO LET 
ANYBODY GO BY 
HE RAN A GOOD RACE 
AT THE SPRING CUP IN NEWBURY YEAH YEAH HE HAD BEEN PULLING AND I GAVE HIM 
TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE SPRING CUP 
TO COME BACK SEVEN TODAY THERE WAS 
NO WORRY ABOUT THAT AS LONG AS WE 
HAD A NICE POSITION AND PUT HER IN 
THE RIGHT PLACE 
I NOTICED THE 
FIRST AND SECOND WERE BOTH BY SAKE 
I KNOW HE'S STARTING TO CHURN OUT 
GOOD WINNERS SPEED AND DISTANCE 
HORSES 
A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HORSES YOU AND JUMP JOCKEYS YOU HAVE A 
LOVELY PIN WITH YOUR OWNER'S 
COLOURED CAP ON BOARD JUMP JOCKEYS 
HAVE A SAFETY PIN 
THEY HAVE A MUCH 
MORE DANGEROUS JOB THAN I 
HAVE THANK

VICTORIA CUP KING OF DIXIE WELL WHAT A 
PERFORMANCE HE WENT ON TO FINISH 
THIRD WE HEARD THAT ZAAHID AND AL 
KHALEEJ TWO DECENT HORSES WE KNEW 
HOW GOOD THEY WERE BEFORE BUT LET'S 
TALK ABOUT KING OF DIXIE 
HOW GOOD A PERFORMANCE WAS THAT TO 
BE SO SLOWLY AWAY AND YET LEAD WITH 
A FURLONG TO RUN 
I'M TRYING TO 
WORK OUT WHY PAUL HAS GOT TO THE 
FRONT SO SOON AFTER HE LEFT WOULD 
HE HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF ACCEPTING 
AND COMING A BIT LATER AND 
RESERVING HIS ENERGY L. DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW THE HORSE HE MIGHT 
HAVE TO BE UP IN DAYLIGHT POSSIBLY 
THAT'S WHY HE DID THAT OF COURSE 
HE'S TRYING TO KEEP TO THEM PLAN A 
OF COURSE PLAN A WAS NOT TO GET 
LEFT OF COURSE BUT BASICALLY THE 
WINNERS ALL CAME FROM NINE TEN THIRTEEN 
AND FOURTEEN FROM THE DRAW 
THAT'S WHERE ALL THE THEY CAME
