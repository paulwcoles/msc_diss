I'M A MEDIEVAL ART HISTORIAN 
AND THIS IS MY CHANCE TO GET OUT ON THE ROAD 
AND SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THE MAP AND LIFE IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
TODAY I'M TRAVELLING THROUGH THE SOUTH EAST 
IT'S AN AREA WHERE YOU CAN REALLY FEEL THE INFLUENCE OF EUROPE ON LIFE IN MEDIEVAL ENGLAND 
STARTING IN EAST KENT I'LL BE LOOKING AT THE STRANGE CREATURES CARVED INTO CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL 
THE EXOTIC FOOD SERVED AT MEDIEVAL FEASTS 
AND I'LL DISCOVER HOW DRAMATICALLY THE COASTLINE HAS CHANGED SINCE THE MAP WAS MADE 
AS I HEAD WEST TO THE LARGEST CITY IN MEDIEVAL ENGLAND LONDON 
THE GOUGH MAP IS NAMED AFTER ITS LAST OWNER RICHARD GOUGH AN ANTIQUARIAN MAP COLLECTOR 
WHO DONATED IT TO THE BODLEIAN LIBRARY IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINE 
IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST MAPS THAT TRIES TO DEPICT BRITAIN ACCURATELY WITH MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED TOWNS 
AND ALMOST TWO HUNDRED RIVERS 
AND EMBEDDED WITHIN IT ARE TANTALISING CLUES ABOUT ITS ORIGINS AND MEDIEVAL ENGLAND 
WE'RE USED TO SEEING BRITAIN LIKE THIS 
BUT THEN THE CONVENTION WAS TO PUT THE EAST AT THE TOP 
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE DIRECTION OF CHRISTIANITY'S HOLIEST CITY JERUSALEM 
TODAY I'M STARTING MY JOURNEY AT THE TOP OF ENGLAND AS THE MAP MAKERS SAW IT ON THE EAST COAST OF KENT 
WHERE VISITORS ARE STILL GREETED WITH AN AWESOME SIGHT THE MAGNIFICENT WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER 
THIS DRAMATIC COASTLINE IS WHERE THE TRADE IN GOODS AND IDEAS FLOWED EASILY BETWEEN ENGLAND AND EUROPE 
IT WAS ALSO THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENCE AGAINST THE FRENCH 
AND THE MAP REVEALS WHICH COUNTRY HAD THE UPPER HAND 
IN THE MID FOURTEENTH CENTURY WHEN THE GOUGH MAP WAS MADE THIS WASN'T THE EDGE OF MEDIEVAL ENGLAND 
CALAIS ABOUT TWENTY MILES OVER THERE ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL WAS ENGLISH 
CALAIS WAS CLEARLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE MAP MAKER WHO SHOWED IT HERE 
AS A WALLED TOWN ALMOST ON THE SAME SCALE AS LONDON ITSELF 
AND THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE THIS MAP WAS MADE 
EDWARD THE THIRD THE KING OF ENGLAND HAD CAPTURED CALAIS FOR THE ENGLISH 
THE GOUGH MAP WAS DRAWN WHILE EDWARD WAS ON THE THRONE WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO CLAIM THE FRENCH CROWN 
SO THE LARGE SYMBOL OF CALAIS ON AN ENGLISH MAP 
COULD BE A BOLD STATEMENT OF THE KING'S TERRITORIAL AMBITIONS 
EDWARD THE THIRD STATIONED A GARRISON IN CALAIS AS A BASE FOR HIS FRENCH CAMPAIGNS 
THIS HAD TO BE SUPPLIED FROM ENGLAND WITH FOOD AND WEAPONS 
THE TOWN RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS 
WAS THE SOUTH EAST'S MOST IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL TRADING PORT SANDWICH 
IN THE DOOMSDAY SURVEY OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHTY ONE SANDWICH WAS RANKED FOURTH IN SIZE AND IMPORTANCE TO LONDON 
SANDWICH'S RICH MEDIEVAL PAST IS ENGRAINED IN ITS STREETS 
AND IN ITS BUILDINGS LIKE THIS LOVELY FOURTEENTH CENTURY GATEHOUSE KNOWN LOCALLY AS FISHERGATE 
AND THE TOWN'S COAT OF ARMS SHOWS THAT IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
SANDWICH WAS ONE OF THE CINQUE PORTS 
ALONG WITH FOUR OTHERS HASTINGS NEW ROMNEY DOVER AND HYTHE 
SANDWICH ENJOYED A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CROWN 
THE SUCCESS OF THE CINQUE PORTS CAN BE TRACED BACK TO EDWARD THE CONFESSOR 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIFTY ONE HE STRUCK A DEAL WITH THE FISHERMEN OF KENT 
WHO WERE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THE TREACHEROUS WATERS OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL BETTER THAN ANYBODY 
HE WANTED MEN AND SHIPS TO GO TO WAR 
AND IN EXCHANGE THEY MANAGED TO EXTRACT A SET OF PRIVILEGES THAT ENABLED THEM TO GET RICH 
ALL FIVE PORTS WERE EXEMPT FROM TOLLS AND CUSTOMS DUTIES 
FREE TO TRADE AND YOU CAN STILL CATCH GLIMPSES OF HOW THEY SPENT THE WEALTH 
THAT THESE PRIVILEGES BROUGHT THEM 
SANDWICH WAS BY FAR THE MOST POPULAR PORT FOR FOREIGN TRADERS BUT ITS POPULARITY WASN'T TO LAST 
THIS WAS THE MEDIEVAL QUAYSIDE 
BOATS FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE WOULD HAVE BEEN MOORED HERE FROM VENICE AND SPAIN FROM THE LOW COUNTRIES 
FROM ITALY AND THEY WOULD HAVE BOUGHT WITH THEM EXOTIC CARGO 
THINGS LIKE SPICES FROM THE FAR EAST 
INCENSE AND MYRRH FROM THE MARKETS OF DAMASCUS AND ALEXANDRIA AND LUXURIOUS TEXTILES FROM ITALY 
AND THE CREWS OF THOSE SHIPS WOULD HAVE BEEN TALKING IN A CACOPHONY OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS PLACE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEAVING 
BUT TODAY IT'S NOT EXACTLY A HARBOUR FOR OCEAN GOING VESSELS 
BECAUSE THE SEA IS MORE THAN TWO MILES AWAY 
THE GOUGH MAP CLEARLY SHOWS SANDWICH ON THE COAST AND IT'S PERCHED 
ON A WATERWAY THAT WAS THEN KNOWN AS THE WANTSUM CHANNEL 
THIS CHANNEL WAS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CONNECTED THE SEA 
TO THE THAMES ESTUARY OFFERING SHIPS A SAFE HARBOUR ON THEIR WAY TO LONDON 
AND THAT'S WHY SANDWICH WAS SUCH A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL TRADING CENTRE 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
BUT TIDAL WATERS SILT FROM RIVERS AND EVEN THE EROSION OF THE CLIFFS OF THANET 
WHICH WAS AN ISLAND IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
GRADUALLY BLOCKED UP THIS MAJOR SHIPPING LANE 
UNTIL SANDWICH HAVEN LOST ITS PLACE ON THE COAST AND THANET JOINED THE MAINLAND 
BY THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY A CHRONICLER RECORDED THAT ALL THE HAVEN IS GROWN TO GREAT FLATNESS 
NARROWNESS CROOKEDNESS AND SHALLOWNESS 
ALL THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE HAD TO GO ELSEWHERE AND SANDWICH REMAINED FIXED IN TIME 
AS I HEAD WEST MY NEXT STOP IS CANTERBURY 
ON THE MAP A SINGLE RED ROUTE LEADS FROM CANTERBURY ALL THE WAY DOWN THE KENT COAST TO SOUTHAMPTON 
INTRIGUINGLY THE MORE IMPORTANT HIGHWAY THE ROUTE FROM LONDON TO DOVER 
AN ANCIENT ROMAN ROAD ISN'T MARKED AT ALL 
NOW THE A TWO IN MEDIEVAL TIMES THIS ROAD CALLED WATLING STREET 
WAS HEAVILY USED BY PILGRIMS HEADING TO CANTERBURY 
CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL WAS THE HOME OF BRITAIN'S MOST FAMOUS MEDIEVAL CELEBRITY THOMAS BECKETT 
IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE WHEN BECKETT WAS CANONISED CANTERBURY BECAME THE MOST IMPORTANT PILGRIM SITE IN MEDIEVAL ENGLAND 
VISITORS CAME HOPING FOR A MIRACLE AT BECKETT'S TOMB 
BUT I'M GOING TO SIDESTEP THE TOURIST TRAIL 
MEDIEVAL ART IS MY SPECIALITY AND THERE ARE SOME CARVINGS HERE THAT I FIND MUCH MORE INTRIGUING 
I'M IN THE CRYPT WHICH IS A WONDERFULLY QUIET SPACE 
AND IT'S WHERE THE COMMUNITY HERE KEPT SOME OF ITS MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSIONS 
INCLUDING THE BONES OF TWO OF ITS ANGLO SAXON SAINTS 
BUT IT'S NOT ALL EARNEST BIBLE STORIES AND SAINTS' LIVES DOWN HERE 
THE CAPITALS OF THE COLUMNS IN THE CRYPT ARE A FESTIVAL OF MONSTERS ANIMALS AND MYTHIC CREATURES 
THIS PAGAN IMAGERY WAS COMMISSIONED IN THE EARLY TWELFTH CENTURY BY THE MONKS WHO WORSHIPPED HERE 
ON THIS CAPITAL WE HAVE THE MOST AMAZING ICONOGRAPHY OF A CREATURE WITH A WOMAN'S BODY 
AND TWO BARE BREASTS AND TWO WOLFISH HEADS 
AND SHE'S CLUTCHING ON THE REIGNS AND THE TAIL OF A DOUBLE HEADED MONSTER 
AND THIS PROBABLY A SCENARIO THAT'S DESCRIBED IN THE LAST BOOK OF THE BIBLE 
THE BOOK OF REVELATION WHICH TALKS ABOUT THE WHORE OF BABYLON RIDING ON THE BEAST OF THE SEAS 
AND THIS CAPITAL IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I THINK OF AS THE MASON'S MONSTER SENSE OF HUMOUR 
IT'S A KIND OF COMPOSITE BEAST WITH A LION'S BODY AND WINGS ATTACHED TO ITS LEGS 
AND A PERPLEXED LOOKING HUMAN HEAD STUCK IN ITS CHEST 
AND A TERRIFYING HORNED MONSTER'S FACE AND HE'S HOLDING RATHER BAFFLINGLY A FISH AND A PEAPOD 
IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THAT SOME OF THE IMAGERY CAME FROM CLASSICAL WRITING FROM ANCIENT ROME 
OVID PLINY AND HORACE AND THIS WAS CONTROVERSIAL 
THERE WAS AN ANIMATED DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS APPROPRIATE 
FOR MONKS TO HAVE MONSTROUS IMAGES LIKE THIS IN THEIR RELIGIOUS FACES 
AND EVEN WHETHER IT WAS SINFUL FOR THEM TO READ CLASSICAL LITERATURE 
BUT WILLIAM OF MALMESBURY A GREAT SCHOLAR AND TRANSLATOR OF CLASSICAL WORKS HIMSELF 
CAME UP WITH A BRILLIANT DEFENCE 
HE WROTE THAT TAKING PLEASURE IN PAGAN BOOKS WAS IN NO WAY A SIN 
AS LONG AS THEIR ORNAMENT WAS EMPLOYED TO THE GLORY OF GOD 
SO LION CUBS WHICH PLINY SAID WERE BORN DEAD AND HAD TO BE BROUGHT TO LIFE BY THEIR MOTHER'S BREATH 
MAY HAVE BEEN USED BY THE MONKS TO REPRESENT THE CHRISTIAN IDEA OF THE RESURRECTION 
ULTIMATELY THESE APPARENTLY PAGAN MONSTERS WERE ASSIMILATED INTO CHRISTIAN THOUGHT 
AND THEY WERE GIVEN MORAL INTERPRETATIONS 
COMING TO SYMBOLISE THINGS LIKE VICE THE DEVIL AND SPIRITUAL CORRUPTION 
LUCKILY THE MONSTERS SURVIVED THE CONTROVERSY 
THEY ALSO SURVIVED A TERRIBLE FIRE IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THAT GUTTED THE CATHEDRAL ABOVE 
THE ENTIRE EAST END HAD TO BE REBUILT 
BUT THE COMMUNITY OF MONKS MANAGED TO TURN THE DISASTER INTO AN OPPORTUNITY 
THE MONKS HAD MONEY TO SPEND BECAUSE OF THE MASSIVE NUMBERS OF PILGRIMS WHO WERE COMING HERE TO CANTERBURY 
TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF SAINT THOMAS BECKETT SO THEY HAD A COMPETITION 
TO CHOOSE A MASON TO BUILD THEIR NEW CATHEDRAL AND THEY SELECTED AN EXTRAORDINARY ARCHITECT FROM FRANCE 
HIS NAME WAS WILLIAM OF SENS 
ACCORDING TO A CONTEMPORARY CHRONICLER WILLIAM WAS CHOSEN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LIVELY GENIUS 
AND GOOD REPUTATION 
FROM FRANCE HE BROUGHT A TEAM OF GLAZIERS AND SCULPTORS AND A NEW IDEA 
THE GOTHIC POINTED ARCH 
THIS ARCHITECTURAL INNOVATION ALLOWED WILLIAM TO DESIGN A CHURCH WITH MORE SPACE 
MORE HEIGHT AND MORE LIGHT THAN HAD EVEN BEEN SEEN BEFORE IN ENGLAND 
BUT HE DIDN'T LIVE TO SEE IT THROUGH 
WILLIAM OF SENS WAS UP ON A SCAFFOLDING 
EXAMINING THE VAULTS THAT WERE BEING BUILT IN THE CROSSING 
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE SCAFFOLDING BENEATH HIS FEET COLLAPSED 
AND HE FELL AMIDST A CLATTER OF TIMBER AND STONE FIFTY FEET 
THE FALL DIDN'T KILL HIM IMMEDIATELY BUT IT DID LEAVE HIM PARALYSED AND HEROICALLY HE MANAGED TO CONTINUE 
TO DIRECT THE BUILDING PROJECT FROM HIS SICK BED 
BUT AFTER A YEAR HE RETURNED TO FRANCE 
WILLIAM DIED IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE BEFORE THE CATHEDRAL WAS COMPLETED 
BUT HE LEFT THE CANTERBURY MONKS A MASTERPIECE 
THE FIRST GOTHIC CATHEDRAL IN ENGLAND AND A FITTING SPACE FOR THE SHRINE OF THEIR BELOVED SAINT 
THOMAS BECKETT 
I'M NOW CONTINUING WEST TO ROCHESTER BUT BEFORE I GET THERE 
I PASS ONE OF THE TOWNS THAT HELPS US DATE THE MAP SHEPPEY 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THE TOWN OF SHEPPEY CHANGED ITS NAME TO QUEENBOROUGH 
BUT ON THE MAP ITS STILL SHEPPEY WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE MAP WAS MADE BEFORE THE NAME CHANGE 
AND THE EARLIEST THE MAP COULD HAVE BEEN DRAWN IS ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE 
BECAUSE COVENTRY IS SHOWN WITH CITY WALLS AND THAT'S THE YEAR THAT THE WALLS WERE BUILT 
IT'S FROM THESE TWO PLACES THAT WE KNOW THE GOUGH MAP WAS MADE WITHIN A NARROW ELEVEN YEAR WINDOW 
AT THE HEIGHT OF EDWARD THE THIRD'S REIGN 
MY NEXT DESTINATION IS THE ROYAL CASTLE AT ROCHESTER 
JUST AFTER THE MAP WAS COMPLETED EDWARD THE THIRD HAD THE CASTLE HERE FORTIFIED AND REFURBISHED 
HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT FRENCH INVADERS 
AND ROCHESTER WAS IN A KEY STRATEGIC POSITION 
GUARDING THE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER MEDWAY AND THE ROAD FROM DOVER TO LONDON 
ROCHESTER CASTLE WAS ALREADY ONE OF THE STRONGEST CASTLES IN EDWARD'S KINGDOM 
ITS FORMIDABLE NORMAN KEEP STILL TOWERS OVER THE CITY ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN FEET HIGH 
WITH WALLS AN IMPRESSIVE TWELVE FEET THICK 
FOR ONE OF EDWARD'S ANCESTORS THE CASTLE'S STRENGTH PRESENTED HUGE PROBLEMS 
KING JOHN IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN FOUND HIMSELF SHUT OUT OF HIS OWN CASTLE 
CONTEMPORARY CHRONICLERS WERE PRETTY MUCH UNANIMOUS IN THEIR CONDEMNATION FOR JOHN 
WHOM THEY DESCRIBED AS A TERRIBLE KING AND A VERY BAD MAN 
HE WAS IN AN ALMOST PERPETUAL STATE OF CIVIL WAR WITH HIS NOBLEMEN 
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T STAND HIS TYRANNY AND HE COULDN'T CONTROL THEM 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THESE NOBLEMEN MOVED INTO ROCHESTER IN AN ATTEMPT TO BREAK JOHN'S POWER IN THE SOUTH EAST 
JOHN WAS OUTRAGED THIS WAS HIS CASTLE 
HE DECIDED TO BESIEGE IT IN PERSON 
HE STARTED BY BURNING THE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER MEDWAY 
THEN ATTACKING THE CASTLE WITH MASSIVE STONE MISSILES 
KING JOHN EVEN STABLED HIS HORSES INSIDE THE CATHEDRAL 
AS AN INSULT TO THE ARCHBISHOP WHO'D LET THE REBELS IN 
AFTER NEARLY TWO MONTHS OF CONTINUOUS BOMBARDMENT 
KING JOHN'S FORCES MANAGED TO PENETRATE THE OUTER WALL 
BUT THEY STILL COULDN'T GET IN TO THIS KEEP IT HELD FAST 
BUT KING JOHN WOULDN'T GIVE UP AND SO HE THOUGHT OF A WAY AROUND THE PROBLEM 
OR MORE ACCURATELY IN THIS CASE UNDER IT 
JOHN CALLED FOR LOCAL MEN TO COME TO ROCHESTER WITH PICKAXES 
HE MADE THEM TUNNEL RIGHT UNDER THIS CORNER 
UNDERMINING THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF THE KEEP 
AND AS THEY DUG THEY PROPPED UP THE TUNNEL WITH WOODEN BEAMS 
THEN HE DEMANDED FORTY BACON PIGS TO BRING FIRE UNDER THIS TOWER 
AND SO HIS MEN SLAUGHTERED THE PIGS AND PACKED THEIR CARCASSES INTO THE TUNNEL 
ALONG WITH LOTS OF DRY BRACKEN AND THEY SET THE LOT ALIGHT 
AND THE HEAT WAS SO INTENSE THAT IT BURNED THE BEAMS THE FOUNDATIONS CRACKED AND THE TOWER FELL 
THE SIEGE SOON CAME TO AN END 
THE REBELS NARROWLY ESCAPED EXECUTION AND WITHIN A YEAR KING JOHN HIMSELF WAS DEAD 
BUT THE CASTLE WAS RESTORED AND REMAINED A ROYAL STRONGHOLD 
SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO THE MAP MAKERS TO MARK IT WITH THE ORNATE STRIPED SYMBOL OF A LARGE CITY 
I'M NOW HEADING TO A PRIVATE ESTATE NEAR TONBRIDGE 
FOR MOST OF EDWARD THE THIRD'S REIGN ENGLAND ENJOYED A PERIOD OF RELATIVE PROSPERITY 
A WEALTHY MERCHANT CLASS WAS BEGINNING TO EMERGE 
AND SOME LONDON TRADERS WERE MAKING SUCH HUGE FORTUNES 
THAT THEY COULD AFFORD TO BUY VAST ESTATES IN THE KENT COUNTRYSIDE 
THIS IS PENSHURST PLACE 
BEHIND ITS TUDOR FACADE LIES ONE OF THE BEST PRESERVED MEDIEVAL HALLS IN BRITAIN 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT PENSHURST WAS A WELL ESTABLISHED HUNTING ESTATE 
WITH ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND ACRES 
IT WAS BOUGHT BY SIR JOHN POULTNEY ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST WOOL MERCHANTS IN THE SOUTH EAST 
WHO'D BEEN LORD MAYOR OF LONDON FOUR TIMES 
HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING THIS MAGNIFICENT HALL COMPLETE WITH CARVINGS OF HIS STAFF 
FOOD HISTORIAN MARC MELTONVILLE HAS PREPARED INGREDIENTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO ENTERTAIN GUESTS 
FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURY FEAST RECORDS REVEAL A TASTE FOR EXOTICISM AND ABUNDANCE 
A WIDE ARRAY OF EXPENSIVE SPICES SWEETS COVERED IN TWENTY FOUR CARAT GOLD 
AN IMPRESSIVE SELECTION OF FISH AND SEAFOOD 
AND JUST LIKE THE MONKS AT CANTERBURY A FASCINATION FOR MONSTERS 
TELL ME ABOUT THIS COS THIS DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE IT FALLS INTO THE SHOWING OFF CATEGORY 
THIS IS I THINK PUT SIMPLY IT'S A BOAR'S HEAD 
SO NOT A PIG BUT A WILD BOAR BUT HE'S BEEN REALLY DRESSED UP 
HE'S HAD HIS HAIR SINGED OFF AND HE'S BEEN BOILED IN STOCK SO HE'S DESIGNED FOR EATING IF YOU WANTED TO 
I'M TOLD THE CHEEKS AND THE PALATE ARE TASTY 
BUT THE RECIPE'S UNUSUAL IN THAT ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT IT TELLS YOU TO MIX UP A PARSLEY BATTER 
SO EGGS AND FLOUR AND THE JUICE FROM A LOT I MEAN A LOT OF PARSLEY 
AND THEN YOU COAT THE HEAD THINLY WITH THIS AND TURN IT BY THE FIRE 
SO TURN ONE SIDE TURN THE OTHER TO BAKE THE BATTER OFF YOU NEED LOTS OF LAYERS 
THERE'S ABOUT ELEVEN ON THERE AND YOU END UP WITH THIS GREEN HEAD 
IT'S REALLY STARTING TO LOOK AS IF THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS TO BRING TO THE TABLE A MYTHICAL BEAST 
HE'S NOT A BOAR ANY MORE IN THIS HALL IN FLICKERING CANDLELIGHT 
YOU'RE BRINGING A DRAGON'S HEAD INTO THE HALL WOW 
THE FINAL CLUE TO THE DRAGON AND WHY I THINK THAT IS 
AT THE END OF THE RECIPE IT TELLS YOU WHEN YOU'RE SERVING IT 
TO STUFF HIS MOUTH WITH CAMPHOR SOAKED RAGS 
SO IT'S LITTLE BITS OF LINEN WITH CAMPHOR AND ACQUAVIT SPIRIT WINE 
AND STUFF IT IN THE MOUTH AND SET FIRE TO THEM AS YOU BRING HIM OUT 
SO NOT ONLY IS HE GOING TO LOOK A BIT LIKE A DRAGON 
HE SHOULD FLAME FROM THE MOUTH 
THAT'S MARVELLOUS WHERE DOES THIS RECIPE COME FROM 
THERE ARE MANY ENGLISH RECIPES FOR BOAR'S HEAD THIS GREEN ONE COMES FROM A FRENCH MANUSCRIPT 
FROM THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY BUT IT LINKS IN WITH THE SORT OF FOOD THAT WE'RE SERVING HERE IN EUROPE 
THEY'RE VERY PAN EUROPEAN AMONGST THE NOBILITY 
A FAMOUS ONE THAT'S SERVED IN LONDON FOR RICHARD THE SECOND IS SOMETHING CALLED COCKATRICE 
AND THAT FOR A COOK IS QUITE AN EXCITING DISH TO DO 
BECAUSE YOU MAKE TWO ANIMALS LOOK LIKE ONE AND YOU END UP WITH A HUGE MYSTICAL BEAST ON THE TABLE 
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THAT IS THAT THESE PEOPLE HAD MONSTERS IN THEIR MANUSCRIPTS 
AND IN THEIR TAPESTRIES AND IN THEIR GARGOYLES AND THEIR BUILDINGS AND THEY ALSO HAD THEM ON THEIR TABLE 
MONSTERS ON THE TABLE YEAH CAN WE SET THIS PUPPY ALIGHT OR RATHER SET THIS DRAGON ALIGHT 
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MOSTLY BECAUSE I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE 
WE'VE NEVER DONE A GREEN BOAR'S HEAD AND I'VE NEVER SET FIRE TO ONE SO WE'VE GOT TO GIVE IT A GO YOU HAVE 
OH LOOK AT THAT FOR A DRAGON HOW'S THAT YEAH THAT IS REALLY GOOD 
SIR JOHN PROBABLY COULD HAVE GOT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT HE NEEDED 
TO SUPPLY HIS HOUSEHOLD FROM HIS VAST ESTATES 
BUT FOR THE KIND OF EXOTIC INGREDIENTS THAT HIS GUESTS EXPECTED 
HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO TURN TO THE MERCHANTS OF LONDON AND THAT IS WHERE I'M HEADING NOW 
ON THE GOUGH MAP THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED RIVERS MARKED IN GREEN EACH WITH A CIRCULAR HEAD 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES IT WAS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT RIVERS HAD THEIR SOURCES IN LAKES 
EVERY RIVER OF SIGNIFICANCE IS INCLUDED 
BECAUSE RIVERS WERE THE MEDIEVAL EQUIVALENT OF A MOTORWAY SYSTEM 
IN A WORLD WHERE FEW ROADS HAD BEEN BUILT SINCE ROMAN TIMES 
RIVERS WERE BY FAR THE BEST WAY OF TRANSPORTING GOODS AND NOWHERE WAS THIS MORE TRUE THAN LONDON 
THE THAMES WAS THE KING OF RIVERS 
IT CONNECTED THE HEART OF ENGLAND TO EUROPE 
AND MADE LONDON ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND POWERFUL CITIES IN THE MEDIEVAL WORLD 
WELL COMPARED TO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CITY MEDIEVAL LONDON WAS TINY 
JUST HERE IT BEGAN IN THE EAST WITH THE TOWER OF LONDON 
AND THEN THE WALL SWUNG ROUND IN THE NORTH ENCOMPASSING SIX DIFFERENT GATES 
AND ENDING UP AT BLACKFRIARS THE DOMINICAN HOUSE 
AND THE CENTRE OF THE MEDIEVAL CITY WAS OLD SAINT PAUL'S 
AND THE ONLY BRIDGE RUNNING INTO IT WAS LONDON BRIDGE 
AND WESTMINSTER WAS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE TOWN JUST A COUPLE OF MILES ALONG 
IN THE EARLY FOURTEENTH CENTURY THE POPULATION OF LONDON IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND SOULS 
THEY WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE FILLED WEMBLEY STADIUM 
BUT TO THE MEDIEVAL TRAVELLER FROM A PROVINCIAL TOWN WHERE THEY MIGHT EASILY HAVE KNOWN EVERYONE 
LONDON WAS A COMPLETE CONTRAST 
MORE PEOPLE THAN THEY'D EVER SEEN MORE NOISE THAN THEY'D EVER HEARD 
FROM ALL THE MANUFACTURING AND MARKET TRADE 
AND A RIVER FULL OF BOATS FROM ALL OVER EUROPE 
VERY LITTLE REMAINS OF MEDIEVAL LONDON 
MOST OF ITS ONE HUNDRED OR SO CHURCHES IF THEY SURVIVED THE REFORMATION 
WERE DESTROYED IN THE GREAT FIRE OF ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX 
ALONG WITH THE HALF TIMBERED HOUSES CRAMMED INTO ITS TWISTING LANES 
BUT WE DO HAVE THE FIRST WRITTEN PORTRAIT OF THE CITY FROM A CANTERBURY CLERK 
WHO WORKED FOR THOMAS BECKETT WITNESSED HIS MURDER AND WROTE HIS BIOGRAPHY IN THE LATE TWELFTH CENTURY 
HIS NAME WAS WILLIAM FITZSTEPHEN 
WILLIAM FITZSTEPHEN WAS IN LOVE WITH LONDON 
HE DESCRIBED IT AS A PLACE OF ABUNDANT WEALTH EXTENSIVE COMMERCE GREAT GRANDEUR AND MAGNIFICENCE 
HE ALSO GAVE US SOME SURPRISING LITTLE DETAILS LIKE WHERE TO GO FOR A LATE NIGHT MEAL 
ON THIS STRETCH OF RIVER BEHIND VINTNERS PLACE AMIDST THE WINE SHOPS 
AND STORE ROOMS FITZSTEPHEN FOUND A PUBLIC COOK SHOP 
HE WAS REALLY TAKEN WITH THE IDEA THAT IF YOU HAD UNEXPECTED GUESTS 
YOU COULD SEND THEM TO THE RIVERSIDE WHERE THEY WOULD FIND ANYTHING THAT THEY DESIRED 
FISH LARGE AND SMALL 
DELICACIES LIKE GOOSE AND WOODCOCK WERE ALL AVAILABLE LATE INTO THE NIGHT 
BUT HE DID CAUTION AGAINST THE ONE THING HE SAW AS A DANGER IN LONDON 
WHICH WAS THE IDIOTS WHO DRINK TO EXCESS 
AS WELL AS FITZSTEPHENS' PORTRAIT WE CAN GET A FEW HINTS OF WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE FOR REAL LONDONERS 
FROM AN UNUSUAL SOURCE 
IN THE BASEMENT OF THE MUSEUM OF LONDON IN EACH ONE OF THESE BOXES ARE HUMAN SKELETONS 
WE'VE GOT THE ROMANS HERE 
AND THEN ON THIS SIDE WE'VE GOT FROM THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD AND THEN AS WE COME DOWN HERE 
JELENA BEKVALAC IS AN OSTEOLOGIST AND SHE'S SELECTED SOME SKELETONS OF LONDONERS 
WHO DIED ABOUT A DECADE BEFORE THE GOUGH MAP WAS MADE 
WHICH OFFER A RARE GLIMPSE OF MEDIEVAL LIVES' 
THIS SKELETON IS PARTICULARLY WONDERFUL BECAUSE IN THE VERTEBRAE 
STILL EMBEDDED IN IT YOU CAN SEE THERE'S AN ARROWHEAD SO YOU CAN SEE THAT AREA THERE 
OH THERE'S THE TIP 
YEP AND THEN IF YOU OPEN THEM UP THEN YOU CAN SEE THE FANTASTIC OH ITS HUGE 
METAL HEAD WHICH HAS THEN GONE THROUGH ONE AND STRAIGHT THROUGH INTO THE OTHER 
AND THEY FIT PERFECTLY TOGETHER 
SO THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A FATAL INJURY 
ERM NO PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FATAL I MEAN IT OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY PAINFUL 
BUT YOU CAN SEE THE AREAS AROUND HERE WITH THE BONE YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S QUITE NICE AND SMOOTH 
SO THEY PROBABLY BROKE OFF THE OTHER PART AND LEFT THE THE ARROWHEAD IN 
IT WAS SAFER TO DO THAT RATHER THAN START CUTTING INTO THE SKIN 
GOD IT NARROWLY MISSED HIS SPINAL CHORD 
YOU CAN SEE IT JUST MIGHT HAVE 
IF YOU LOOK DOWN THERE THAT'S WHERE YOUR SPINAL COLUMN WOULD RUN 
BUT IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE IMPINGED UPON IT 
THEY MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME DISCOMFORT WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED DISCOMFORT 
YES THAT'S PUTTING IT MILDLY I'D RATHER NOT BE SHOT IN THE BACK 
RIGHT O. K. 
BUT QUITE PHENOMENAL THAT THEY SURVIVED AND THAT'S REMAINED 
I'VE READ ABOUT STABBINGS IN MEDIEVAL LONDON 
BUT I'VE NOT COME ACROSS BRAWLS WITH BOWS AND ARROWS 
I THINK ITS MORE LIKELY THAT HE WAS INJURED FIGHTING FOR EDWARD THE THIRD IN FRANCE OR MAYBE IN SCOTLAND 
SO WHAT ABOUT THIS INDIVIDUAL HERE THIS INDIVIDUAL HERE 
WE KNOW IS A FEMALE SHE'S PROBABLY IN HER THIRTIES 
AND ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING AREAS IS THAT IF WE LOOK HERE IN HER VERTEBRAE 
ON THE VERTEBRAL BODIES YOU CAN JUST SEE THERE'S A LITTLE WHAT'S A VERTEBRAL BODY 
THIS IS A VERTEBRAL BODY HERE IF I JUST TAKE THAT OUT 
YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A BIT OF A DEPRESSION HERE ON THAT AREA THERE 
OH YEAH AND THAT WOULD INDICATE TO ME THAT SHE MAY HAVE CARRIED HEAVY LOADS 
SO IT'S AN INDICATION OF LOAD BEARING AND STRESS 
WOMEN'S WORK COULD BE VERY PHYSICAL 
RECORDS SHOW THAT THEY WORKED AS BLACKSMITHS AND EVEN IN CONSTRUCTION 
HEAVY LABOUR MAY HAVE DAMAGED THIS WOMAN'S SPINE BUT WE KNOW IT DIDN'T KILL HER 
BOTH OF THESE PEOPLE DIED FROM THE BLACK DEATH 
THE HORRENDOUS PLAGUE THAT CAME TO ENGLAND BY BOAT IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT KILLING ITS VICTIMS IN A MATTER OF DAYS 
THEIR BODIES WERE FOUND IN A MASS GRAVESITE DUG OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS' 
WE'VE GOT A PHOTOGRAPH HERE THAT YOU CAN SEE FROM THAT YOU CAN SEE THIS NICE LINE HERE 
WHERE YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT THE TRENCH THAT THEY WOULD HAVE PREPARED 
AND THEN AS PEOPLE WERE DYING ALTHOUGH IT WAS AN OVERSPILL CEMETERY 
THEY'RE NICELY LAID OUT IN ROWS 
AND THEN IN BETWEEN YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'VE PUT CHILDREN 
OH WHAT A MOURNFUL LITTLE SIGHT 
YES IT IS VERY SAD REALLY 
THE BLACK DEATH HAD SUCH AN IMPACT 
THAT CONTEMPORARY CHRONICLERS THOUGHT THE HUMAN RACE ITSELF COULDN'T SURVIVE IT 
A THIRD OR MORE OF THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN AND HALF THE POPULATION OF LONDON DIED IN JUST TWO YEARS 
THE GOUGH MAP WAS MADE JUST A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN YEARS AFTER THE BLACK DEATH FIRST STRUCK 
AND IT'S EXTRAORDINARY TO THINK OF THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS AMAZING RECORD OF THEIR COUNTRY 
OVER SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
THEIR WORLD WAS DEVASTATED BUT THE MAP THEY LEFT BEHIND 
IS FULL OF CONFIDENCE AND REMAINS TO THIS DAY A BOLD STATEMENT OF NATIONAL IDENTITY
