JOHN VIRGO 
GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY HOW LONG 
WILL IT LAST THIS EVENING LIANG 
WENBO HAS DONE REMARKABLY WELL TO 
GET THIS FAR 
THIS MORNING HE SEEMED TO BE 
RUNNING A LITTLE BIT OUT OF GAS 
YES OBVIOUSLY UP AGAINST A PLAYER 
WHO CAN MAKE YOU PAY RONNIE US A 
LOT AND WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE IN THE 
BREAK BUILDING DEPARTMENT THIS 
MORNING RONNIE US OF THEM 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
THAT IS THE START HE WAS LOOKING 
FOR A TERRIFIC OPENING RED 
NOT THE BEST OF CHANCES BECAUSE AT 
THE MOMENT THE BLACK IS TIED UP 
IS HE ON AN ALTERNATIVE RED JUST 
BELOW THE PINK 
HE IS HAVING ANOTHER GO MACRO TO 
GET THE CORRECT ANGLE HE NEEDS ON 
THIS RED TO DISTURB THE RED 
NEAREST THE BLACK GO 
ALL ABBAS UDDIN FROM SEEMING TO 
MISJUDGE A SHOT HAS ACTUALLY WORKED 
IN HIS FAVOUR BACK ALL OF A 
SUDDEN CAN HE JUST SCREW PAST THE 
BLACK HE NEEDS TO NOT TOUCH THE 
BLACK AT ALL 
THAT WAS THE LAST THING HE WANTED 
JUST COULD NOT AVOID THE KISS ON 
THE BLACK THE PINK IS NOT 
AVAILABLE 
HE WENT FOR THE BLUE IT WAS A 
RISKY SHOT TO PLAY PARTICULARLY IN 
THE OPENING FRAME OF A SESSION BUT 
THAT IS THE WAY HE HAS PLAYED THE 
MATCH AND THE TOURNAMENT HE WILL 
NOT CHANGED NOW HE IS GOING TO GET ANOTHER CHANCE 
YANG WHEN BALL WILL NOT HAVE TO 
PLAY THIS ONE TOO HARD LIANG 
WENBO 
IT IS A CHANCE BUT IT IS NOT 
GUARANTEED THERE IS STILL SOME 
WORK TO DO 
THAT IS QUITE NICE BUT STILL THAT 
MAIN PACK OF SIX REDS HAVE AT SOME 
STAGE GOT TO BE DISTURBED 
THIS IS WHERE HE WILL BE AT HIS 
MOST COMFORTABLE IN AND AROUND THE 
BLACK 
HE DOES LEAVE IT UNTIL THE LAST 
MINUTE TO GO IN TWO REDS I DO NOT 
BLAME HIM HE IS A LONG WAY BEHIND 
HE DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE ANY UNDUE 
RISK RISK HE IS FORCED TO GO FOR THE BLUE 
HERE WHICH IS PROBABLY THE BEST 
CHOICE OF BALL IN ORDER TO GO INTO 
THE REDS 
HE STILL NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT 
LUCKY GREAT SHOT 
HE HAD DONE WELL HE DESERVES TO BE 
ON SOMETHING EASIER 
ROLLED IT IN NICELY WHAT SORT OF 
AN ANGLE AS HE GOT ON THE BLUE TWO 
REDS WITH EVERY GO TO THE RIGHT 
CORNER WOULD DEFINITELY GO INTO 
THE RIGHT CORNER IT IS A FRAME WINNING CHANCE NOW 
JUST THIS BLACK AND ONE MORE RED 
REQUIRED THERE IS A RED LOOSE IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE 
TO HIM HE COULD HAVE COME OUT WITH 
THE NEGATIVE ATTITUDE BUT HE DOES 
NOTHING OF THE SORT 
HE CERTAINLY 
PLAYS THIS WAY IN THE QUALIFYING 
SECTIONS OF TOURNAMENTS PERHAPS 
THE ODD MATCH SLIPS BY BECAUSE OF 
HIM BEING TOO AGGRESSIVE IF HE IS 
GOING TO TURN AROUND THIS MATCH 
THE ONLY WAY AGAINST RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN IS TO KEEP UP THE LEVEL 
OF ATTACK HE LOOKS VERY ASSURED 
AMONG THE BALLS GREAT CUE ACTION 
VERY SOLID STRIKE NICE FINISH 
POSITION WITH THE CUE KEEPS HIS 
HEAD UP AFTER THE SHARP AFTER 
THE SHOT 
A TERRIFIC START FROM YOUNG THE AND 
BROKE LIANG WENBO RONNIE IS JUST 
COMING TO THE TABLE BECAUSE IT IS 
THE FIRST FRAME AND HE WANTS TO POT 
A FEW BALLS 
HE CONCEDES WHAT A START FOR THE 
YOUNG MAN FROM CHINA LIANG WENBO 
WITH MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB BUT YOU 
ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE THAT FIRST STEP 
AND HE HAS DONE THAT HE STILL 
TRAILS BY ELEVEN FRAMES TO SIX THEN 
JOINED BY DENNIS TAYLOR 
IMPRESSIONS OF THIS YOUNG MAN 
OVERALL A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE 
WARMED TO HIM 
HE THEN THERE AT THE END OF THE 
FRAME HE WAS LOOKING AND THE CROWD 
TO SEE IT A FEW OF HIS FRIENDS WERE 
AROUND HE IS QUITE A CHARACTER 
THE CROWD HAVE TAKEN TO HIM WHAT A 
PLAYER LOVE WATCHING HIM IT IS 
SO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT HIS SHOTS 
ANYTHING HE CAN POT HE IS GOING TO 
TAKE ON WHY SHOULD HE CHANGE IT 
HAS GOT UNDER THE QUARTER FINALS 
HE WILL GO DOWN FIGHTING IF HE IS 
TO GO OUT INTERESTING TO SEE 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN COMEBACK BE THE 
TABLE TABLE YES HE WOULD NORMALLY CONCEDE HE 
HAS BEEN VERY FOCUSED HERE 
THROUGHOUT THE TOURNAMENT THE WAY 
HE HAS PLAYED HIS STUNNING IS 
STUNNING HE PLAYED REALLY WELL IN 
THE SESSION BEFORE THIS 
HE SEEMS EXTREMELY RELAXED AROUND 
THE VENUE HE IS LAUGHING AND 
JOKING AND HIS DEMEANOUR SEEMS 
ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON 
THAT IS RIGHT THIS IS WHERE IT 
REALLY START IT IS THE SECOND HALF 
OF THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
THE WORK BEGINS RIGHT NOW FOR HIM 
BACK NOW DIJON AND STEVE TO JOHN 
LIANG WENBO HAS GOT TO PLAY A 
FLAWLESS SNOOKER HE CANNOT AFFORD 
ONE MISTAKE IT IS BIG ASK 
A RELATIVELY LOOSE SAFETY SHOT FROM 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN L. SHOULD THINK RONNIE WILL BE WONDERING IF HE AND 
WHEN BALL WOULD TAKE THIS SHOT DOWN 
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE 
LIANG WENBO 
HE HAS NOT LEFT THE RED HE PLAYED 
SO THERE IS NOTHING EASY FOR RONNIE 
TO GO AT HERE HIS LONG POTTING IN 
THIS MATCH WOULD BE THE ONLY THING 
HE WOULD BE REALLY DISAPPOINTED 
WITH WHEN HE GETS IN AMONGST THE 
BALLS HE HAS SCORED AS USUAL BUT 
SOME OF THE LONG POTTING HAS LEFT A 
LITTLE TO BE DESIRED IT IS QUITE 
STRANGE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT 
RONNIE AND THE FIRST ROUND PLAYED 
A CHINESE OPPONENT THE QUARTER 
FINALS HE PLAYS ANOTHER CHINESE 
OPPONENT IS THIS A SIGN OF THE 
TIMES TIMES THAT IS THE QUESTION WE HAVE BEEN 
ASKING FOUR PLAYERS FROM CHINA IN 
THE FINAL STAGES OF THE CRUCIBLE 
HOW LONG BEFORE IT IS EIGHT APPEAR 
A SAFETY SHOT FROM RONNIE TURNING 
DOWN THE POSSIBILITY OF A POT 
RONNIE IS A LITTLE BIT ON THE 
DEFENSIVE AT THE MOMENT THAT IS 
NOT A BAD POLICY REALLY THAT IS A 
GREAT SHOT FROM LIANG WENBO HE 
LOOKS TO HAVE PUT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE THERE IS NO 
OBVIOUS ESCAPE THAT PATH THIS 
RED IS HORRIBLE THAN THE RIGHT HAND 
SIDE HE MAY BE LOOKING AT SOME 
SORT OF NESTLE INTO THE PACK 
PERHAPS THE RIGHT HAND SIDE CUSHION 
KEPT THE RED FULL BALL AND TRY TO 
ROLL THE WHITE BALL INTO THE RIGHT 
HAND CORNER 
THAT WILL DO NICE JUDGEMENT OF 
PACE 
LONG RED PAST THE BLUE INTO THE 
YELLOW POCKET CAN ALWAYS CREATE 
A CHANCE BY PLAYING A GOOD SAFETY 
HE DOES NOT HAVE TO TAKE THIS SHOT 
ON THIS IS HOW THE GAME HAS 
CHANGED WHAT A GREAT SHOT THAT WAS 
WHAT A FANTASTIC SHOT YOU COULD 
NOT STRIKE A BALL BETTER 
TECHNICALLY HE IS VERY VERY GOOD 
THE GAME HAS CHANGED IN MANY WAYS 
BUT THE SPECULATIVE POT WITH THE 
BEAUTY WARMLEY LEAVING THAT SHOT ON 
GOING BACK TO CLIFF WILSON FROM THE 
SEVENTIES MARK WILLIAMS IN RECENT YEARS 
TAKING A POT THAT LOOKED RISKY BUT 
AND NOT SO RISKY WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
THE AT THE CUE BALL THE OUT 
COME THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD SHOT IMMACULATE CUEING 
VERY GOOD POT A LOT BETTER THAN IT 
LOOKED THE CUE BALL WAS A LITTLE 
BIT TOO CLOSE TO THE CUSHION TO 
MAKE IT CERTAIN THEY ARE SO EASY 
TO MISS HE HAS GIVEN HIMSELF A 
CHANCE 
GOING BACK TO GET ANY STICKINESS OF 
HIS CUE 
HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF A NICE ANGLE ON 
THE BLACK THE WAY I HAVE SEEN HIM 
PLAY HE DOES NOT GO INTO THE REDS 
TO REALLY QUITE PREPARED TO PICK 
THEM OFF 
HAS HE JUST GONE A LITTLE BIT TOO 
STRAIGHT ON THIS BLACK HIM NICE 
CONTROL A LITTLE BIT STRAIGHT HE 
MAY HAVE TO FORCE THIS LITTLE BIT 
NO PROBLEM PLAY THE RUN THROUGH 
INCH PERFECT ON THE BLACK L. THINK 
IT MIGHT JUST BE A GOOD TIME TO GO 
INTO THE REDS 
FOR THE RIGHT HANDED PLAYER WAY THE 
BALLS ARE SITUATED IS SLIGHTLY 
EASIER 
HE JUST PUSHED THE CUE BALL FORWARD 
A BIT TOO MUCH HE WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT DOES HE CUT 
HIS LOSSES THERE IS HE GOING TO 
SPECULATE ON THIS RED L. THINK 
WE KNOW THE ANSWER 
IT DEFINITELY GOES WE MAY SEE HIM 
PLAY THIS LITTLE BIT HARDER THAN 
YOU MAY EXPECT THE MORE PACE AT 
THIS ANGLE THE MORE ACCURATELY 
HAVE GOT TO BE ACCURATE 
HE FULLY COMMITTED THAT TIME I MAY 
HAVE BEEN STUNNING IT FOR BAULK 
COLOUR HE HAS LEFT RONNIE CHANCE 
NOT AN EASY ONE THIS RED TO THE 
RIGHT HAND CORNER 
THERE IS THE 
RISKIER RED INTO THE MIDDLE POCKET 
A BIT MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT LOOKS 
ON OUR T. V. SCREENS HE COULD FREE 
THE PINK IT IS A RISKIER IF HE 
PLAYS THE RED INTO THE GREEN POCKET 
HE IS HAMPERED BY THE BLACK 
NOT A GOOD START FOR RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN AT THE MOMENT THAT MUST 
HAVE HURT 
I FELT THAT 
THE GOOD THING FOR RONNIE IS IF HE 
HAS DONE SOME DAMAGE TO HIS RIGHT 
HAND HE CAN PLAY RIGHT HANDED FOR 
THE REST OF THE GAME 
THAT IS ONE WAY OUT OF IT VERY 
SELF CRITICAL IS RONNIE 
THAT LOOKED LIKE A SAFETY SHOT 
THERE FROM 
LIANG WENBO MISCUED LIANG WENBO DELIGHTED TO SEE THAT 
RED FIRMLY FIXED TO THE BAULK 
CUSHION THE FIFTY THREE POINT LEAD LOOKS 
LOT HEALTHIER WITH A RED SAFE AND 
HIS JOB WILL BE TO TRY AND MAKE 
MORE REDS SAFE 
I NEVER EXPECTED 
HIM TO PLAY THAT IT IS ONLY THE 
RED THAT HE PLAYED THAT HE COULD 
LEAVE MAYBE RONNIE CAN JUST GET 
PAST THE BLUE TO THAT RED BY THE 
LOW YELLOW 
LIANG WENBO AS GIVEN RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN CHANCE HE SHOULD NOT 
HAVE HAD IT COULD BE GREAT SHOT 
FROM THE GREEN TO THAT RED ALONG 
THE TOP CUSHION 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN QUICKLY GETS THE 
OF GIDEON OUT OF THE POCKET FOR THE 
REFEREE THE GREEN 
THE ONLY THING IS IF HE DOES NOT 
CATCH THAT RED PERFECTLY HE MAY 
NOT HAVE KNOCKED IT ON 
THERE IS CERTAINLY A CHANCE TO GET 
RIGHT BACK IN THIS FRAME THERE IS 
THE PROBLEM OFF THE RED ON THE 
BAULK CUSHION HE IS GOING TO TRY 
AND WIN THE FRAME AT THIS VISIT 
THEY ARE ALWAYS TOUGHER ALONG THE 
BAULK CUSHION THAN THE TOP CUSHION 
BECAUSE OF THE EFFECT OF THE NAP ON 
THE CLOTH IT WILL BE INTERESTING 
TO SEE HOW RONNIE OF SOLVING GOES 
ABOUT IT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HE 
WILL BE UPSET WITH THAT VERY 
RARELY DOES HE MAKE MISTAKES GOING 
INTO THE PACK 
NOT A BAD SAFETY SHOT JUST LOOKING 
TO SEE IF THIS RED WILL GO INTO THE 
LEFT CORNER HE HAS CAUGHT UP DOWN 
QUITE EAGERLY TO PLAY IT GOT 
DOWN 
RONNIE WOULD LOVE TO PLAY SAFE OFF 
THE RED THAT IS NEXT TO THE BLACK 
BUT HE HAS CAUGHT THE BUMP OFF THE 
MIDDLE POCKET HE WAS SO DETERMINED 
TO TRY TO BRING THE BLACK INTO PLAY 
THAT HAS GIVEN LIANG WENBO A CHANCE 
NOT AN EASY POT THIS 
HE HAS GOT THE RED PAST THE PINK 
FOR THE BLACK IT IS LESS RISKY IN 
SOME RESPECTS BUT HIS POSITIONAL 
PLAY WILL NOT BE AS GOOD AS THE ONE 
HE IS NOW TAKING ON 
HE HAS POTTED MORE DIFFICULT BALLS 
ALREADY IN THIS MATCH HE EXPECTED 
TO GET THAT ONE HE DID HAVE HIS 
BRIDGE HAND ON THE TABLE WHICH MADE 
HIM SLIGHTLY AWKWARD 
WHEN YOU WEAR PLAYING IN THE 
TOURNAMENT HOW DO YOU FIND THE 
BALLS ALONG THE CUSHION QUITE QUITE NICELY ALONG THE TOP CUSHION 
PLAYERS DO IT HAVE TO FEAR HITTING 
THE BALL SO LONG SOMETIMES THEY 
ARE EASIER THAN OTHERS ANOTHER 
MISTAKE FROM RONNIE HE HAS GOT A 
TWO BALL PLANT FROM DISTANCE 
SHOULD HE CONSIDER IT BUT HE DOES 
KNOW HAVE TO RISK EVERYTHING WITH 
LIANG WENBO BEEN THE PLAYER HE HAS 
IT IS ANOTHER CHANCE TO CLEAR UP 
THE BALLS FOR RONNIE HE DOES NOT 
USUALLY NEED SO MANY DIED SAT THE 
CHERRY DATES BACK BITES AT 
JUST GOT TO BE PATIENT SOMETIMES 
IT IS A VIRTUE 
THAT WAS THE WRONG CHOICE OF SAFETY 
SHOT HE HAD ANOTHER OPTION OF 
HITTING THE RED TO THE RIGHT OF THE 
PINK THE BLUE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO 
BE IN THE WAY 
IF LIANG WENBO HAD REFUSED THE 
DOUBLE EARLIER IN THIS FRAME AND 
PLAYED THE SAFETY SHOT TO TIE 
THINGS UP RONNIE WOULD PERHAPS 
HAVE NOT HAD THIS THIRD BITE AT THE 
CHERRY YOU WOULD NOT BET AGAINST 
HIM CONVERTING THIS ONE THE BLUE 
IS OFF ITS SPOT BUT IT SHOULD NOT 
BE A PROBLEM 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE SCOREBOARD IF 
HE POTS THE RED AND THE BLACK HE 
WILL ONLY NEED UP TO AND INCLUDING 
THE BLUE TO CLINCH THE FRAME THAT 
IS THE BETTER OPTION WITH THE BLUE 
IT NOT BEEN ON ITS SPOT NOT 
BEING ON ITS SPOT 
GOT A BIT OF A FLYER OFF THE 
CUSHION COUPLE OF TIMES WE HAVE 
SEEN THAT HAPPEN TODAY A VERY 
SMALL POSITIONAL ERROR PUTS A 
LITTLE BIT MORE HEAT ON THE POT 
THAT DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE THIS FRAME IS BACK ON 
GUARANTEED TO BE GOING FOR THE POT 
BUT HOW DO YOU GET ON THE BLUE 
STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN OFF THE TOP 
CUSHION DRIED IT L. DON'T KNOW 
THE SLOW DRAG THAT IS THE HARDEST 
SHOT IN THE WORLD TO PLAY WHAT A 
GREAT SHOT 
THAT IS ABOUT AS GOOD 
AS HE COULD DO 
HE'S GOING TO BE AT FULL STRETCH 
MAKES THE SHORT CREEP TWICE AS 
DIFFICULT THE SHOT TWICE AS 
RONNIE WILL BE PRAYING HE DOES NOT GET THIS BLUE 
HE HASN'T GOT AWAY WITH IT THAT IS 
MORE OR LESS END OF MATCH IF 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN CAN KNOCK THIS 
PINK IN 
IT IS ALWAYS THERE THE WAY 
IN THIS GAME WHEN YOU NEED THE RUN 
OF THE BALL YOU NEVER GET IT 
MISSED THE BLUE AND LIFTED RIGHT 
OVER THE MIDDLE POCKET IT WAS A 
FORMALITY FROM THE MOMENT IT 
APPEARED THERE A LITTLE BIT OF AN 
EXPERIENCE HE PLAYED A FEW 
RECKLESS SHOTS HE WILL TELL 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN NOW GOES WITHIN 
ONE FRAME OF A SEMI FINAL PLACE 
HE IS ON THE BRINK NOW OF HIS EIGHT 
SEMI FINAL PLACE STEPHEN HENDRY 
SAID TODAY SAFETY IS OVER RATED 
WE WERE ATTRIBUTING THOSE KIND OF 
IDEAS TO LIANG WENBO BUT HE DID 
SHOW SOME STRATEGIC PROCESS EARLIER 
ON 
HE GETS HIMSELF FIFTY THREE POINTS IN ON FRONT AND HAS A STRAIGHT FORWARD 
SAFETY TO GET THE 
WHITE BEHIND 
BLACK AND 
HE TAKES ON THE DOUBLE 
THE BOYS IN COMMENTARY SAID THAT 
WAS THE WRONG SHOT TO PLAY RONNIE 
MISSED WITH THAT SHOT HE HANDED 
THE INITIATIVE BACK TO RONNIE WE WE SAW A COUPLE OF SIGNS OF 
FRUSTRATION 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER FRUSTRATION HE PRACTISES THIS OR NOT HE KNOWS 
IF HE KNOCKS IN THIS LONG RED HE 
HAS GOT A CHANCE HE WRAPS THE 
TABLE L. HAVE NEVER TRIED THAT BUT 
THE TABLE ALWAYS COMES OUT ON TOP 
IT IS NOT BOILING POINT 
FRUSTRATION 
IT WILL NOT DO HIM ANY FRUSTRATION HARM AT ALL 
IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE 
LIANG WENBO WILL BE WITH US FOR TOO 
MUCH LONGER 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN REQUIRING ONE 
MORE FRAME TO GO THROUGH 
WHAT ARE YOU LIKE AT LIP READING 
JOIN 
WELL IT IS IN CHINESE SO I JOIN WILL STRUGGLE 
WHO HAVE BREAK OFF SHOT FROM RONNIE 
POOR BREAK OFF SHOT 
FOUR BALL PLANT I THINK IT MIGHT 
BE ON HE COULD CHOOSE THAT IN 
PREFERENCE TO THE LOOSE RED 
HE HAS DECIDED TO PLAY THE RED INTO 
THE GREEN POCKET WHICH IS THE 
UNCONVENTIONAL WAY 
I DON'T THINK THAT FOUR BALL PLANT 
WAS ON 
RONNIE WAS WALKING IT IS NOT YOUR 
TONGUE YET SON TURN 
I DON'T THINK THE PLANT WILL GO NOW 
HE IS ALL ON RED INTO THE MIDDLE IT IS MISSABLE NICE POT JUST UNDERHIT IT SLIGHTLY 
WRONG ANGLE ON THE BLUE HE HAS GOT 
A GOOD LINE WHAT ABOUT THE LENGTH 
HE IS A BIT UNLUCKY THERE 
NOW HE HAS GOT A VERY TRICKY WHEN 
INTO THIS MIDDLE POCKET 
WHICHEVER RED HE TAKES ON WILL BE 
VERY MISSABLE 
TOUGH SHOT GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
IT SEEMS TO TAKE RONNIE A WHILE TO 
GET HIS ROLLS ROYCE RHYTHM OF A 
CUEING ACTION GOING IT WAS THE 
SAME IN HIS FIRST MATCH HE DID NOT 
HAVE THE BEST OF STARTS BUT THERE 
IS SOMETHING THAT TRIGGERS IT 
GETTING IN AMONGST THE BALLS LIKE 
THIS WILL CRAIGAVON INTO THINKING 
THIS IS HIS FRAME AND MATCH CHANCE 
TRIGGER AND HIM 
IF HE DOES NOT FANCY THE BLACK HE 
HAS AN ALTERNATIVE OF THE PINK TO 
THE LEFT MIDDLE 
I MEAN NO DISRESPECT TO HIS 
OPPONENT BUT I DO NOT THINK HE HAS 
EVER BEEN CHASING THE GAME HE HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN IN AND THESE COMFORT 
ZONE IN THIS MATCH HE DID NOT HAVE 
THE BEST START BUT SINCE HE PULLED 
THE DEFICIT BACK HE HAS ALWAYS 
LOOKED IN COMPLETE CONTROL AND IT 
MAYBE HAS AN EXTRA GEAR 
RONNIE'S 
RONNIE MOVED INTO THAT EXTRA GEAR 
IN HIS SECOND ROUND MATCH AGAINST 
MARK WILLIAMS WHEN YOU THOUGHT MARK 
WILLIAMS WOULD BE THERE OR 
THEREABOUTS TOWARDS THE END OF THE 
MATCH THERE IS A PROBLEM PLAYING 
AGAINST AS MUCH OF AN UNDERDOG AS 
LIANG WENBO YOU ARE EXPECTED TO 
BEAT THEM EASILY 
ONCE THESE TWO OPEN REDS HAVE BEEN 
CLEARED THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF 
A COUPLE OF CLIENTS IN THE PACK 
ONE LOOKS TO BE VERY CLOSE 
PLANT'S PLANTS HE IS NOT ON THE 
ONE INTO THE RIGHT CORNER NOW THIS 
IS A BIT DIFFICULT HE USED ALL THE 
POCKET WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE PACE 
NOW THEY ARE ALL IDEALLY PLACED TO 
FINISH THE MATCH AT THIS VISIT 
HE HAS PERFORMED ADMIRABLY THIS 
YOUNG MAN WILLIE THORNE SAID HE 
HAS BEEN LIKE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR 
AND HE HAS L. HOPE HE LEARNS FROM 
THIS EXPERIENCE IT WILL NOT BE THE 
LAST TIME WE SEE HIM IN A MAJOR 
QUARTER FINAL ANTHONY BE EVEN 
BETTER THAN THAT AND MAYBE EVEN 
IT IS ALL RIGHT BEING AGGRESSIVE 
BUT YOU CANNOT TAKE LIBERTIES WITH 
THE TOP PLAYERS 
THERE ARE STILL A BIT OF WORK TO DO 
FOR RONNIE O'SULLIVAN THIS COULD 
STILL GO WRONG HE COULD CATCH THE 
CANNON VERY NICELY HERE HE HIT THE 
WRONG BALL HE WAS LOOKING TO HIT 
THE RED LIANG WENBO STILL IN THE GAME 
IS THERE A PLANT THERE DOES THAT 
PLAN GO PLANT IT IS RISKY HE 
HAS GOT TO HIT THIS FAIRLY THICK 
HE MAY AS WELL THROW CAUTION TO THE 
WIND 
IT IS THE LAST THROW THE DICE WIND IT ISN'T A SHOT FOR NOTHING THIS 
ONE BUT HE MADE IT UNLUCKY WITH 
THE DOUBLE KISS BUT FOR THAT HE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN BACK OF THE TABLE 
FOR THE BLUE 
YOU KNEW HE WAS GOING FOR THIS 
PINK THIS IS TOUGH HOW TOUGH IS 
THIS WHAT A GREAT SHOT 
HE MUST HAVE ICE RUNNING THROUGH 
HIS VEINS WHAT A SUPERB SHOT L. 
KNOW THE MAXI THAT IT IS AN 
ATTACKING GAME BUT I DO NOT KNOW 
MANY 
PLAYERS WHO 
WOULD HAVE PLAYED 
THAT BRILLIANT 
THE CHAIN THE SNOOKER FANS CAN BE 
VERY PROUD OF THEIR NEW HERO 
CHINESE BINGEING BE WATCHING ON 
DING JUNHUI WATCHING ON POSSIBLY 
BACK IN CHINA FOR THE SUMMER HE 
HAS GOT SOME STIFF COMPETITION 
FOR A LEFT HANDER THAT IS NOT SO 
MUCH OF A PROBLEM 
HOW MUCH ROOM IS THERE PAST THE 
BLACK IT IS DIFFICULT FROM THE 
COMMENTARY BOX IT IS JUST ABOUT 
ALL THE POCKET HE HAS GOT TO BE 
ACCURATE HERE 
IT WAS A TOUGH SHOT IF HE HAD BEEN 
RIGHT BEHIND IT I WOULD HAVE 
FANCIED IN GETTING IT FANCIED HIM 
RONNIE CAN JUST NIP THIS RED 
PLAYING THE SAFETY TWENTY POINTS IN 
THE LEAD NOT THE BEST SAFETY SHOT 
HE WAS TRYING TO HIT THE RED AWAY 
AND DOWN AND NOT OFF THE BACK 
CUSHION THIS RED IS POTTABLE FOR 
LIANG WENBO THIS IS THE FIRST JOB 
TO BE DONE PERHAPS HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT 
BOTH PLAYERS NEEDING THE RED ON THE 
TOP CUSHION 
I GUESS THAT RED WAS NOT ANYWHERE 
NEAR THE CROWD ARE RIGHT BEHIND 
THE LINE OF THE SHOT THERE WAS 
AGHAST THAT WAS GETTING LOUDER L. 
USED TO HEAT THAT AS A PLAYER A 
GASP HATE 
NOW HE HAS CHOICES OF COLOURS HE 
HAS GOT A NICE ANGLE ON THE PINK 
IT IS NOT EASY TO GET PERFECTLY ON 
THIS RED HAS TO GO PRICE ACROSS 
AND AWAY FROM THE CUSHION WOULD BE 
IDEAL TWICE ACROSS ANOTHER FOOT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDY PERHAPS A 
FRACTION MORE ANGLE THE YELLOW IS 
HANGING OVER THE POCKET 
HE IS JUST 
MAKING CERTAIN WITH THE RED AND 
PLAYING A SNOOKER BEHIND THE BLACK 
WHAT A POT HE STROKED THAT IN AS 
EASY AS YOU LIKE L. HAVE GOT A NEW 
FAVOURITE FOR THIS FRAME 
HE MUST 
BE CAREFUL NOT TO SNOOKER HIMSELF 
BEHIND THE BLUE HE HAS GOT A CHANCE 
SCREW THE GO IN THE YELLOW 
EASIER FOR RIGHT HAND A MAN THE 
LEFT HANDER THIS CLEARANCE HE HAS 
TO MAKE SURE HE GETS WELL OVER WITH 
THE GREEN THAT IS A GREAT SHOT HE 
HAS BECOME FAVOURITE FOR THIS FRAME 
NOW 
IF THE BLUE WAS ON ITS SPOT I WOULD 
SAY IT WAS A FORMALITY HE IS JUST 
CHECKING WHAT HE NEEDS THE CUE BALL 
TO BE CHECKING WHERE THERE IS 
ONE MORE FRAME BEFORE THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL JUST THE PINK TO PULL ONE BACK 
VERY WELL PLAYED WHAT A PINK HE 
POTTED IN THE MIDDLE BOTH ARE 
GOING FOR LITTLE BREAK IT IS TWELVE SEVEN 
THIS YOUNG MAN DOES HAVE SEVEN BASE IN HIS VEINS HE IS REWRITING 
THE RULES OF COMMENTARY ALL YOU 
HAVE TO DO IS SEE THE TOUGHEST 
SHORT AND CALL THAT ONE 
HE DOES 
LIKE TO GO FOR HIS SHOTS EVEN 
UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE HE WAS 
UNLUCKY TO FINISH HERE THAT IS A 
TOUGH SHOT AND LOOK WHERE IT GOES 
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS GOING RIGHT 
DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE POCKET HAD 
HE WON THE LAST FRAME HE WOULD ONLY 
BE THREE BEHIND RONNIE 
RONNIE WILL BE BEATING FOR ONE CHANCE TO 
KILL THE MATCH OFF IF HE CAN GET 
TO THE NEXT SESSION IF YOU ARE 
BEHIND AND YOU CAN GET TO THE NEXT 
SESSION YOU FEEL THAT YOU CAN HAVE 
A CHANCE HE LOOKS TOTALLY RELAXED 
THE FACT THAT HE HAS PRACTISED WITH 
RONNIE AT THE ACADEMY IN SHEFFIELD 
THAT WILL STAND HIM IN GOOD STEAD 
THERE ARE FIVE CHINESE PLAYERS ALL 
STAYING IN ONE HOUSE IN SHEFFIELD 
ALL PLYING THEIR TRADE AS NON 
PROFESSIONALS ALL ENJOYING THE 
EXPERIENCE 
I BELIEVE THAT DING EXPERIENCE JUNHUI'S MUM IS THERE AS WELL SHE 
PUT CLIFF THORBURN IN HIS PLACE 
NOT THE BEST OF BREAK OF SHOTS HE 
HAS CAUGHT THE END RED TOO THICK 
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU PUT ON THE 
CUE BALL HAS GONE INTO THE RED AND 
CAUGHT IT TOO THICK LIANG WENBO 
WILL BE DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE LEFT 
SOMETHING AS EASY AS THIS OFF THE 
BREAK 
WHAT A SURPRISE IT WAS NOT AS SAFE 
MIGHT IT WAS NOT A STRAIGHT 
FORWARD POSITIONAL SHOT 
THAT WAS NOT A STRAIGHTFORWARD SHOT 
EITHER EVERY SHOT LIANG WENBO 
TAKES ON COULD POTENTIALLY BE HIS 
LAST SO VERY WELL POTTED A CHANCE 
TO MAKE IT TO THE INTERVAL 
THE CHANCE OF A THIRD ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN TWO HUNDRED TO ONE 
BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT STARTED IF HE IS 
TO MAKE A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THE 
CHOICE IS TO GO INTO THE REDS 
FAIRLY ANY REALLY MACRO 
HE MADE SURE HE WAS ON THE RED 
THIS IS WHERE IT WILL GET A BIT 
MORE DIFFICULT 
HE DOES NOT REALLY WANT TO BE 
STRAIGHT ON THIS HE HAS GOT AN 
ANGLE RUNNING OUT OF BALLS HERE 
HE HAS GOT TO GET THE REST OUT THE 
PACK OF REDS AFTER HERE IS POT THIS 
RED IS NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE 
ANY BETTER 
AFTER HE POTS THIS RED 
HE HAS RELEASED ANOTHER RED 
IT IS A CHANCE RONNIE START OF 
YESTERDAY LOOKING AT THE BENTLEY 
CONVERTIBLE OR STOP IF HE AND WHEN 
BOWE GETS ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN HERE HE IS LOOKING 
AT ACCORD DEEPER THAN OF IT AT 
CORBY VERSION OF IT 
THE BLACK JUST STOPPED MIGHT JUST 
STUCK 
SO OFTEN WHEN THERE IS A BLACK BALL 
STUCK IN THE CORNER POCKET IT ENDS 
IN A BIT OF A STALEMATE 
IT IS A BIT EARLY TO CALL ME RACK 
BACK TO CALL A RE RACK 
LIANG WENBO WILL NOT WANT THIS TO 
GO INTO A STALEMATE EITHER 
THIS COULD BE THE MOST SAFETY SHOT 
HE AND WHEN BELL IS GOING TO PLAY 
CONSECUTIVELY HERE LIANG WENBO A CHANCE FOR RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
THAT WAS A TERRIFIC POT IT WAS AN 
EXCELLENT SAFETY SHOT BUT LIANG 
WENBO JUST LEFT THAT ONE RED OUT 
JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE SITUATION 
I THINK HE HAS GOT TO PLAY THE 
BLACK BLACK HE IS LOATHED TO PLAY THE BLACK 
POSITION IS NOT GUARANTEED IT IS 
ALSO NOT GUARANTEED OF THE LOT 
OFF THE YELLOW I'M SURE ONE OF 
THOSE REDS WILL GO HE HAS STILL GOT TO BE CAREFUL STILL SOME WORK TO DO EXCELLENT SHOT 
NO SPOT FOR THE PINK AND NO OTHER 
SPOTS AVAILABLE A SUPER POSITIONAL 
SHOT THERE 
LOOKING TO SEE IF HE CAN POT THE 
PINK L. DO NOT THINK THE BLACK GOES IN THE CORNER 
THE BLACK CERTAINLY GOES INTO LEFT 
CORNER EVERY CHANCE FOR RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HERE HE VERY RARELY 
MAKES THE POSITIONAL MISTAKE JUST 
A FRACTION SHORT OF PACE POSSIBLY 
IS HE GOING TO COME BACK UP FOR THE 
BLUE MAKING SURE HE IS PAST THE 
BLUE 
ONE OF THE REDS WILL DEFINITELY 
GOING TO THE LEFT CORNER WHEN HE 
POTS THIS HE WILL PROBABLY MAKE THE 
PINK AVAILABLE WHICH HE HAS DONE 
A LOT OF PLAYERS WOULD HAVE MADE 
HARD WORK OF THIS POTENTIAL MATCH 
WINNING CLEARANCE OFF THE SOFA SO 
GOOD FOR RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
NOT AS NICE AS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED 
HE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO SEE THIS 
ONE GO IN 
PLAYED IT I SLEEP PLAYED IT 
NICELY A GENTLE CANNON INTO THE 
RED TO THE RIGHT OF THE BLACK

HAS NOW GOT AT TWO POINT LEAD 
AS THE END WHEN BOWL PLAYED HIS 
LAST SHOT IN THIS YEAR'S WORLD

INTERVAL HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE 
HANGING AROUND TOO MUCH GET THE 
JOB DONE HAVE AN AIR EARLY NIGHT 
READY FOR THE SEMI FINALS 
JUST THE GREEN NEEDED TWENTY THREE POINTS IN

FINAL TOMORROW HE PLAYS SEVEN 
TIMES CHAMPION STEPHEN HENDRY HE 
GOES AND SHAKES THE HAND OF THE 
YOUNG MAN FROM CHINA WHAT A

HIS MATCH AGAINST MARK WILLIAMS 
EVEN THOUGH HE BEAT MARK QUITE 
COMFORTABLY HIS LONG POT SUCCESS 
RATE WAS NINE PER CENT AT SOME STAGE AT ONE 
STAGE HE PULLED A SHOT AT AT THE 
END OF THAT THESE IS AS GOOD A POT 
AS YOU WILL SEE THIS IS WHEN HE IS 
DANGEROUS HE'S FORTY FIRST SO BEHIND 
THAT GIVES HIM A BALLS AND HE WANTS 
TO CLEAR ALL HE IS FORTY ONE POINTS 
BEHIND 
FOUR YEARS AGO HE BEAT STEPHEN 
HENDRY SEVENTEEN TO FOUR IN THE SEMI FINAL WELL 
HE SEEK INSPIRATION FROM MEMORY 
LIKE THAT 
IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO THINK 
ABOUT THERE IS NO WAY STEPHEN 
HENDRY WILL BE THINKING ABOUT THAT 
HE WILL BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT HE 
HAS DONE HERE THIS YEAR IT WILL BE 
A BATTLE TO SEE WHO LOCKS THE LONG 
ONES IN IN THAT MATCH WHO KNOCKS

WAS ALL ABOUT STEPHEN GETTING 
THROUGH THE FIRST MATCH AND GETTING 
HIS CONFIDENCE HE HAS SURPRISED A

THROUGH THE DOOR WE WILL KEEP 
CHATTING UNTIL HE GET THE 
MICROPHONE ON IS THE IN TOP GEAR 
THE WAY HE PLAYED IN THAT LAST

WHERE ARE YOU IN YOUR PREPARATIONS 
I'M HERE TO WIN IT WE'RE ALL HERE 
TO WIN IT IT IS JUST LIKE ANY 
OTHER TOURNAMENT IT IS THE MAN WHO 
PRODUCE OF THE BEST FORM WELL IN 
BRAVELY WHEN OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A 
BIT MORE TENSION AND PRESSURE HERE 
INVARIABLY WIN HE NEVER GET MANY 
LUCKY WINNERS EVERYONE IS HERE TO 
WIN IT NOW IT IS JUST BEGINNING 
NOW NOW DENNIS WAS IN THE COMMENTARY BOX 
WHEN YOU SCORED THE MAXIMUM HAD IS 
THAT AFFECT YOU 
I WOULD RATHER MAKE TEN HER ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY 
BREAKS AND NOT GIVE MY OPPONENT A 
SHOT AND MAKE A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN IT IS JUST ONE 
FRAME IT IS NICE TO GET 
YOU HAVE WON MORE THAN STEPHEN 
THERE THERE BREAK BUILDING HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY 
STRONG POINT APPEARED AND GET YOU 
MORE MORE WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION WHEN ALI 
CARTER A STEP ONE IN LAST NIGHT 
YES IT WAS HAVING THE POT A 
FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT YOU HAVE TO 
BE PLEASED REALLY DISAPPOINTED 
BECAUSE IT'S PUT MY MONEY IN HALF 
A GOOD HALF A BENTLEY NOW 
THE ODDS ON A THIRD ONE HAVE BEEN 
ABSOLUTELY SLASHED AT THIS POINT 
YOU MIGHT GET THE NEW PAIR OF 
TRAINERS TRAINERS IT IS LIKE SPLITTING THE LOTTERY 
WITH TWENTY WINNERS 
WHAT IF HE MADE A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THAT IS THE 
ULTIMATE MAXIMUM BREAK YOU ARE 
ONLY SHARE THE PRIZE WOULD GET THE 
HIGH BREAK BUT IT WAS ONLY COUNT AS 
A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN SO DO NOT BEEN MAKING A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE 
I JUST WONDER HOW MUCH THE PRESSURE 
IS ON 
THE PRESSURE IS OFF WANTS TO GET TO 
THE SEMI FINAL STAGE WE KNOW WHAT 
TO EXPECT FROM EACH OTHER HE IS 
COMING INTO THE BUSINESS END OF THE 
TOURNAMENT YOU READ THEIR RELISH 
THESE SITUATIONS ARE YOU DO NOT

ANOTHER STEPHEN DOES THIS IS WHERE 
IT JUST GETS INTERESTING THE FIRST 
TEN DAYS IS GETTING THROUGH GETTING

RUNNING HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE 
SESSIONS YOU DO AND AT THAT DATE 
WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE 
I NEED TO SOME DAYS YOU COME OFF 
THE TABLE AND YOU'RE TIRED YOU'RE 
THINKING ABOUT STUFF SOMETIMES THE 
BEST THING FOR ME IS JUST TO GET 
OUT IT ALL DISAPPEARS AND POSITIVE 
THOUGHTS COME BACK IT IS SOMETHING 
I HAVE TO DO OTHERWISE I END UP NOT 
WANTING TO PARTICIPATE NOT WANTING 
TO BE AROUND IT IS SOMETHING I 
NEED TO DO KNOW WHEN I GO TO

PLACE IT IS LIKE MY MEDICINE IF

GOOD LUCK FOR TOMORROW IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
I LOVE PLAYING STEPHEN FANTASTIC 
PLAYER CRAIG CHAMPION IT IS A 
PRIVILEGE TO PLAY SOMEONE LIKE THAT 
IF YOU ASKED ME FIFTEEN YEARS AGO IF I 
IT WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO PLAYING 
STEPHEN HENDRY IN THE SEMI FINAL I 
WOULD HAVE BITTEN YOUR HAND OFF IT 
SHOULD BE GREAT MATCH 
STEPHEN HAS BEEN CALLED THE ROLLS 
ROYCE OF SNOOKER YOU'RE AFTER 
BENTLEY ALI CARTER IS AFTER 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT THE ONLY 
PEOPLE BENEFITING THIS YEAR FROM 
THE PRIZE MONEY AT THE CAR 
MANUFACTURERS WHEN IT COMES TO 
SNOOKER RICHARD HAMMOND HAS 
SOMETHING OF A MARKET RELATIONSHIP 
THIS SPORT A LOT HATE 
RELATIONSHIP A LOVE HIT 
RELATIONSHIP RELATIONSHIP AS AGAIN TO WATCH IT HAS PARTICULAR 
DRAMA TENSION AND EXCITEMENT AS 
THE GAME TO PLAY IT AS AWKWARD 
MEMORIES ASSOCIATED WITH IT TO ME 
I'M TERRIBLE I'M B. ON AWFUL IT IS 
NOT A SCALE THING IT IS NOT 
BECAUSE I LOOK BIT SHORT NEXT TO 
THE ITEMS YOU HAVE TO USE TO PLAY 
IT IT IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN 
THE POINT IS REACHED IN THE BIN 
WHEN PEOPLE SUGGEST THE GAME IN THE 
PUB THAN THEY REALLY PILE ON THE 
PRESSURE SO I PLAY WILL TAKE BY 
FIRST SHOT AND THEN THERE IS A 
SILENCE AS EVERYONE THINGS THE 
POOR LAD THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG 
WITH HIM THE MORE YOU DRINK IN A 
POLL THE BETTER YOU THINK YOU'RE 
AT SNOOKER JUST AS THE MORE 
ATTRACTIVE YOU THINK YOU WERE TO 
MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX THE 
FAST YOU'RE RUNNING CON AND 
MISCONCEPTION MISCONCEPTION L. 
USED TO LIKE WATCHING IT ON BLACK 
AND WHITE IT IT PRESENTED BY 
CERTAIN CHALLENGE FOR THE 
COMMENTATORS MISS THAT L. SHOULD 
NOT REALLY BE TALKING TO YOU 
ANYWHERE IT IS YOU LUCK THAT KEEP 
KNOCKING US OFF AIR EVERY TIME WE 
ARE GETTING READY TO GO ON AIR 
SNOOKER BY RIGHTS I SHOULD NOT BE 
HERE L. AND GREATER BREAK THAT 
CAMERA BUT WE'RE NOT ON AIR THIS 
TIME SO YOU CANNOT KNOCK US OFF 
WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS MUST FEEL 
PARTICULARLY INTENSE BECAUSE IN 
FRONT AT YOU HIS THE MOST FAMILIAR 
THING IN YOUR ENTIRE WORLD AND YET 
THE CONTEXT EVERYTHING BEYOND IT 
IS MIND NUMBING 
NOTHING LIKE DRIVING A CAR VERY 
FAST FAST WE'RE NOT DRIVING CARS VERY FAST AT 
THAT TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE ON THERE 
IS NOTHING LIKE SITTING ON THE SOFA 
EATING CRISPS AND THINKING I WISH 
I WAS DRIVING BUT I CANT BECAUSE 
THE SNOOKER IS ON IT IS A 
SENSITIVE ISSUE FOR ME HE ASKED ME 
TO TALK ABOUT SNOOKER CANNOT 
PLAY IT AND EVERY TIME IT ON THE 
TELLY IT NOT AS OFF THE TELLY L. 
DO NOT LIKE IT 
KEEPING THEM OFF AIR L. HAVE A 
MENTAL PICTURE OF AN SITTING ON THE 
SOFA IN HIS LEATHERS FIDDLING WITH 
HIS KEYS TOTALLY REDUNDANT ENJOY 
YOUR NIGHT OFF WE HAVE NOW FILLED 
THREE OF THE FOUR SEMI FINAL SPOT 
ITCHING TO GET INTO THE OTHER ONE 
IS GLASGOW POT MAX STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
HE HAS SUCH NAKED AMBITION AND 
AGGRESSION AT THE TABLE IT TENDS 
TO BOIL OVER OCCASIONALLY HE IS A 
PERFECT SPECIMEN FARMER GRAPHOLOGY 
EXPERT WE LOOK AT THE BACK OF THE 
WRITING AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE 
PRESSURE 
THE TROUBLE WITH HIM HIS HE HAS TWO 
SITE WHICH IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR 
HIM TO RECONCILE HE HAS HIS PUBLIC 
IMAGE WHICH IS THE SIGNATURE THE 
SIGNATURE SLOPES TO THE RIGHT IN 
FACT WHEN WE SEE HIS SURNAME IT 
IS JUST VERY POWERFUL LOAD OF 
AGGRESSIVE ANGLES IT SHOWS 
DETERMINATION AND STUBBORNNESS THE 
FIRST NAME IS STEPHEN HAD THAT IS 
QUITE FLOWING HE HAS GOT A JAVELIN 
AS T. BAR THAT WOULD INDICATE 
THAT HE LIKES TO SHOOT WHAT OTHER 
PEOPLE TOWARDS OTHER PEOPLE HE 
REALLY FEELS IT IS UP TO HIM TO 
ACHIEVE TO A CERTAIN LEVEL HE MUST 
NOT LET HIMSELF DOWN THERE IS 
APPOINTED ANGLE WHICH SHOWS THAT 
HIS MIND MUST BE MADE UP AT WHAT HE 
HAS TO ACHIEVE HE IS QUITE 
DEMANDING WHEN WE LOOK AT THE 
WRITING THE WRITING ITSELF IS A 
ROUNDED WHICH IS USUALLY A SIGN OF 
WARMTH AND KINDNESS TO PEOPLE WE 
HAVE THE ARCHED STYLE 
WHICH WHICH SHOWS STUBBORNNESS AND 
SOMETIMES A BIT OF A TEMPER OR 
ANGER WE HAVE THE LEFT SLANT 
WHICH INDICATE HE ASKED TO DO IT 
HIS WAY AND DOES NOT LIKE BEING 
TOLD WHAT TO DO IN REAL TERMS HE 
IS NOT AN ANGRY PERSON THINK THE 
WRITING SHOWS A TEAM PLAYER 
SOMEBODY WOULD SUPPORT FRIENDS AND 
FAMILY TO THE NTH DEGREE A PERSON 
IS GENUINE BUT WHO ALSO BELIEVES 
IN FAIRNESS L. DO NOT THINK THERE 
IS A LOT OF FEELING FENN HAS BEEN 
DONE TO HIM IN HIS WRITING HE HAS 
GOT NOTHING IN IT TO SHOW HE IS AN 
AGGRESSIVE PERSON FAIRNESS 
THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF 
GRIEVANCE THAT MAKES HIM LIKE THIS 
VERY INTERESTING THE PLOT THICKENS 
JOE PERRY IS STEPHEN MAGUIRE'S 
QUARTER FINAL OPPONENT THIS 
AFTERNOON THE SCOT FINALLY EDGED 
AHEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE 
MATCH THEY HAD TO FINISH THE 
SESSION EARLIER BECAUSE THEY RAN 
OUT OF TIME HERE IS THE FIRST OF 
THIS EVENING'S CONCLUDING SESSION 
MAGUIRE IS AHEAD WILLIE THORNE AND 
NEAL FALLS IN THE COMMENTARY BOX 
GOOD SHOT FROM JOE PERRY A LITTLE 
BIT OF HOPE HERE THERE IS LIFE IN 
THE FRAME 
JUST A LITTLE BIT AWKWARD AT THE 
MOMENT HE WOULD IDEALLY LIKE TO 
GET ON THE PINK THOSE FIVE REDS 
ARE QUITE SIMPLE THE PINK WOULD 
RE SPOT ON THE BLACK SPOT 
HE CAN GET ON ALL THREE REDS HERE 
OVERRAN IT SLIGHTLY 
HE CAN PLAY FOR THE LOOSE RED BUT 
IT DEPENDS WHETHER THERE IS A MIX 
UP A NATURAL ANGLE OR NOT THAT 
IS A GREAT SHOT BECAUSE NOW IT IS 
EASIER TO BREAK BUILD WHEN YOU 
PLAY THE RIGHT ATTACKING SHOT YOU 
DESERVE WHAT YOU GET AROUND THIS IS 
ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS THAT WAS 
EXCELLENT 
THIS COULD POTENTIALLY BE A BIG 
BIG FRAME SHOULD JOE MANAGED TO 
CLEAR UP IT OBVIOUSLY THE BLACK 
WILL BE A CONCERN AND WHICHEVER 
COLOUR HE TAKES WITH THESE REDS 
WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE HE WILL 
NEED THE BLACK WITH THE FINAL 
BLACK YOU'RE NOT PLAYING POSITION 
YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO KNOCK IT IN 
HE REALLY HAS A CHANCE NOW THE 
BLUE OFF ITS SPOT IS SOMETHING OF 
A DISTRACTION HE WILL NEED TO 
FINISH IN FRONT OF IT IF HE IS NOT 
CAREFUL THE BLUE WILL NOT GETTING 
AWAY FROM THERE THAT IS O. K. 
SLIGHTLY SHORT BUT IT WILL BE ALL 
RIGHT 
IF THAT WHITE GOES ANOTHER RIGHT TWELVE INCHES THEN THE CLEAR UP IS 
ALMOST A CERTAINTY BUT NOW TO GET 
FROM GREEN TO BROWN IS NOT 
STRAIGHTFORWARD THAT EXTRA FOUR OR 
FIVE INCHES OF PEACE MAKES ALL THE 
DIFFERENCE P. C. PACE 
THIS IS 
THIS IS ONE WAY THAT HE COULD GO AROUND 
OFF TWO CUSHIONS 
HE COULD PLAY THE GREEN INTO THE 
SAME POCKET AS THE YELLOW HE HAS 
KIND OF GONE IN BETWEEN THE TWO L. 
THINK HE PLAYED THE GREEN INTO THE 
SAME POCKET AS THE ALL HE HAS GONE 
A FRACTION TOO FAR AS THE YELLOW 
YOU CAN SEE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS NOW 
TO REGAIN POSSESSION POSITION 
THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT BOUNCE 
OFF THE CUSHION HE PLAYED THAT 
BROWN PERFECTLY IT COULD NOT BE 
ANYTHING BUT PERFECT BUT IT JUST 
TOOK OFF 
IT CAME OFF THE CUSHION QUICKER 
THAN IT WENT ON HE IS FURIOUS DO 
NOT DO THAT TO YOUR TIP JOE 
BECAUSE IT COULD DAMAGE IT THE 
ONES THAT BOUNCE OFF THE CUSHION 
THEY GO ON FLASH AND ABSOLUTELY 
TAKE OFF FLUSH 
VERY UNFORTUNATE A VERY GOOD BREAK 
WHICH PUT HIM RIGHT BACK IN THE 
FRAME AND IT IS NOT OVER YET 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE WILL BE DELIGHTED 
WITH THE SAFETY SHOT HE HAS JUST 
PLAYED HE MAY DECIDE TO PLAY THE 
LONG DOUBLE BUT AT APIECE WERE THE 
BLUE WILL GO 
INTO THE 
MIDDLE 
SIDE CUSHION BUT THIS IS A TOUGH 
SHOT HE HAS PLAYED THE DOUBLE 
WILL PLAY PERFECT WELL PLAYED 
AND ANOTHER EXCELLENT SAFETY SHOT 
THIS IS A MASSIVE FRAME FOR BOTH 
PLAYERS BECAUSE BOTH WILL FEEL THAT 
THEY SHOULD HAVE WON IT 
THAT IS A PRETTY PRETTY DECENT 
SHOT L. DO NOT THINK STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE WILL BE REMOTELY INTERESTED 
IN THIS THE PRIORITY IS TO GET THE 
BLUE SAFE SHOULD BE O. K. GOOD SHOT 
HE CAN PLAY THIS STRAIGHT UP AND 
DOWN THESE ARE FINE HAS LONG AS 
YOU GET PAST THE BAULK LINE IF YOU 
DO NOT YOU ARE LEAVING A POT HAS 
SHE 
AS IT IS FRAME BALL HE WILL BE 
TAKING IT ON 
INTO THE NEXT RICOH AND IT IS 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE TO PLAY PERRY 
HAVING MADE A BREAK OF SIXTY NINE 
THESE SHORTS CAN AFFECT YOU 
SHORTS HE HAS HIT IT ALL WRONG 
SHOTS 
JOE PERRY COULD BE TEMPTED TO POT 
ONE OF THE FOUR ROUND THE 
PINCUSHION WHEN THE PINK SPOT 
IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS BUT IT MAY BE 
WORTH THE RISK 
BUT AT SIXTY THREE IN FRONT WOULD HE WANT TO 
BRING THE BLACK INTO PLAY IF HE 
MISSES 
HE HAS DECIDED TO TAKE ON THE SHORT 
I SUGGESTED HE IS PLAYING FOR THE 
BLACK STUNG OFF THE CUSHION 
STUN BUT THESE REDS TO THE MIDDLE 
YOU KNOW THAT STEPHEN MAGUIRE WILL 
TAKE THEM ON 
ALL THAT IS STOPPING STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE GET DOWN TO PLAY THIS 
STRAIGHT AWAY IS THE POSSIBLE KISS 
OFF THE BROWN IF HE PLAYS OFF THE 
FIRST RED HE WOULD LIKE TO STAY 
THE PINK BUT HE CANNOT HIT IT SLOW 
ENOUGH HE HAS TO AVOID KISSING THE 
BALLS DOWN THE OTHER END 
HE MANAGED TO AVOID THAT CANNON AND 
HE IS JUST ABOUT ON THE RIGHT SIDE 
OF THE BLUE 
JOE HAS MADE BREAKS OF FORTY FOUR AND FIFTY NINE IN 
FRAMES AND STILL LOST THE FRAME HE 
HAS ALREADY MADE FIFTY NINE IN THIS FRAME 
THERE AT LEAST FOUR FRAMES HE 
SHOULD HAVE WON STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
KEEPS COMING BACK TIME AFTER TIME 
AND PINCHING THEM 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE KNOWS HE NEEDS A 
COLOUR AT THIS END PREFERABLY THE 
PINK 
THE ANGLE WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT RIGHT 
TO GET ON THE PINK AND THAT IT WAS 
AS POOR A POSITIONAL SHOT AS HE HAS 
PLAYED FOR A WHILE HE IS ON WRONG SIDE OF THE BLUE 
IF THEY PINK BALL PINK 
BALL 
I MENTION THAT HE NEEDED THE PINK 
ON ITS SPOT WE CATCH THE ANGLE HE 
HAS FOR THIS CANNON HE MAY NOT GET 
A BETTER ANGLE THAN HE JUST HAD TO 
PLAY THAT CANNON THE REASON HE DID 
NOT IS BECAUSE THE PINK IS ON THE 
BLACK SPORT SPORT I 
WONDER IF HE WILL PLAY THE CANNON 
RED TO RED TO GET THE ANGLE IF IF YOU PLAY THE CANNON SOMETIMES YOU 
GET THE DOUBLE KISS AND THE RED 
JUST STAYS THERE HAS HE GOT THE 
ANGLE L. DO NOT LIKE THE RED BEEN 
VERY TIGHT JUST A FRACTION OFF THE 
CUSHION IF YOU CAN IN THAT YOU 
CAN END UP DOUBLE KISSING CANNON 
THAT 
HE HAS MISSED IT ALTOGETHER HE CAN 
PLAY THE CANNON IF HE WANTS TO FROM 
GREEN IT IS A NATURAL SHOT 
STRAIGHT IN THERE 
HE HAS A CHOICE HE CAN KNOCK THAT 
OUT FROM GREEN OR HE CAN DECIDE TO 
PLAY IN BEHIND THE RED 
TERRIFIC SHOT AND WHAT A CHANCE 
NOW THIS WOULD BE A STEEL STEAL 
JOE WAS UNLUCKY IN THE FIRST FRAME 
WHEN HE PLAYED PERFECTLY INTO THE 
CLUSTER OF REDS AND DID NOT QUITE 
GET ON ONE HE COULD HAVE WON BOTH 
THESE GAMES THERE IS POSSIBILITY 
HE COULD RULE LOSE BOTH OF THEM 
HE COULD NOW 
HE IS CHECKING THE SCORE HE WILL 
KNOW THAT HE NEEDS THE LOT IT IS 
SIMILAR FRAME TO THE PREVIOUS ONE 
EVEN TO THE CASE THAT THE BLACK IS 
TIGHT AND TERRY GOT BAD BOUNCE 
FROM BROWN TO BLUE 
THERE IS A 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR JOE PERRY IF THE 
PINK IS ON ITS OWN SPOT IT IS EASY 
TO GET 
PERFECT ON 
IT 
BUT HE 
HAS TO 
COME OFF THE 
CUSHION AND 
GET HIGHER 
AND THE 
PINK TO 
GET CLOSE TO THE 
BLACK HE COULD GET A CHANCE BUT HE 
MAY HAVE TO GO IN AND OUT OF PORK 
THIS IS THE KEY SHOT OUT OF 
BAULK 
HOW ABOUT THAT FOR A CLEARANCE SEVENTY 
CLEARANCE FROM STEPHEN MAGUIRE HE 
POINTS THE TABLE ENJOY JOE PERRY 
IS DISAPPOINTED HE PUNCHED THE 
TABLE IN JOY 
JOE PERRY WON THE NEXT FRAME TO 
DRAW LEVEL NOW IT IS STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE TO PLAY IN THE NEXT FRAME EXCELLENT SHOT 
THAT HAS GIVEN HIM A GOOD CHANCE 
INTERESTING THAT HE IS PLAYING FOR 
THE BLUE NO PROBLEM GETTING UP 
AND DOWN FOR THE NEXT RED HE WANTS 
TO AVOID BEEN ANYWHERE NEAR THAT 
POCKET THAT WAS NOT GOOD SHOT 
HE HAS STILL GOT THE RED TO THE 
LEFT CENTRE 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE'S TUM TO GET A BAD 
CONTACT QUITE HORRENDOUS KICK H. E. COULD HAVE DONE LOT OF DAMAGE 
HE COULD HAVE DONE A LOT OF DAMAGE HERE THIS DEFINITELY KICK BADLY 
IT MADE A BAD SOUND WHAT A CHANCE 
DEPENDS WHAT ANGLE HE HAS ON THIS 
RED HE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET ON 
TO A COLOUR HE'S TOO MUST THE KISS 
ON THE BLACK HE NEEDS TO MISS THE 
KISS BUT THIS BLACK IS VERY 
AWKWARD 
THAT WAS A GREAT POT STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE IS ENTITLED TO FEEL 
AGGRIEVED OVER THE KICK HE HAD A 
FEW MOMENTS AGO BECAUSE IT LOOKED 
LIKE HE WAS GOING TO GO IN NINE IN 
FRONT AT THE INTERVAL NOW IT LOOKS 
LIKE IT COULD BE TEN TO NINE TO JOE PERRY 
MASSIVE FRAME 
HE IS NOW THIRTY TWO POINTS IN FRONT HE 
WILL NEED ONE MORE RED 
THE RED ALONG THE CUSHION IF HE 
CAN GO PINK RED BLACK OR PINK RED 
PINK THEN HE DOES NOT BE TO DO TOO 
MUCH WITH 
THE CUE 
BALL 
BUT I 
AM NOT 
SURE HE 
HAS GOT THE ANGLE 
HE HAS PLAYED THAT NICELY HE KNOWS 
HE NEEDS TWO MORE REDS 
THAT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD SHOT 
EXCELLENT POSITIONAL SHOT THIS 
BLUE WILL MAKE FORTY FIVE SO WHAT 
DIFFERENCE SO WE WILL WHACK MORE 
RED WILL BE NEEDED FORTY FIVE POINTS MINUS ONE 
MORE RED 
IT IS UNUSUAL MAKING BREAKS OF FORTY NINE 
FIFTY NINE SIXTY THREE FIFTY FIVE THAT YOU HAVE NOT WON 
ALL FOUR FRAMES 
HE WILL ONLY HAVE 
ONE TWO OF THE FRAMES BUT THIS 
FRAME SHOULD BE SAFE NOW DESPITE 
THE FACT THAT HE DID NOT QUITE GET 
THAT CANNON RIGHT 
JOE PERRY WITH AN EXCELLENT BREAK 
OF FIFTY FIVE HAS WON THE FRAME AND ONCE 
AGAIN JOE PERRY LEADS A TEN TO NINE THIS 
IS CLOSE HOW IMPRESSIVE HAVE YOU 
HOW IMPRESSED HAVE YOU BEEN WITH 
JOE PERRY CONTAINING A VERY 
DANGEROUS ANIMAL LIKE STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE PINCHED MAGUIRE TWO GREAT FRAMES THAT COULD EASILY 
HAVE GONE TO JOE PERRY JOE PERRY 
KEEPS STROLLING ROUND THE TABLE HE 
IS A VERY FLUENT PLAYER THAT WAS A 
TERRIFIC BREAK STEPHEN MAGUIRE WAS 
UNLUCKY TO GET THE KICK BUT THE 
INTERVAL CAN CHANGE THINGS AROUND 
YOU CAN FOLLOW THIS ON INTERACTIVE 
IF YOU WISH WE WILL BE BACK AFTER 
NEWSNIGHT AT ELEVEN TWENTY P. M. WE WILL LEAVE 
YOU WITH MEMORIES OF MAN WHO WON 
THE TITLE BE HERE AFTER DENNIS 
JOE JOHNSON THE YEAR AFTER 
DENNIS 
BETTY BOO WHERE ARE YOU 
BABY
