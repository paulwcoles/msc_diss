DO YOU EVER WONDER WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A BUG YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT 
THIS INCREDIBLE INVENTION IS THE TRANSLATION LENS 
IT TRANSLATES THE THOUGHTS OF SMALL CREATURES SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND 
EXTRAORDINARY WE HAD NO IDEA HUMANS WERE SO INTELLIGENT 
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD IT'S LIFE BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT 
MEET THE MINI BEASTS YOU LOVE TO HATE COS WE'RE TRULY UNLOVED 
UNLOVED I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT BEING UNLOVED DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY WAYS 
OF HAVING A POP AT SLUGS HUMANS HAVE COME UP WITH I LOST COUNT AT FOUR HUNDRED 
SLUG PELLETS SLUG POISON SLUG SPRAY IRON SULPHATE AMMONIA SALT 
EPSOM SALTS WHICH IS LIKE SALT ONLY NASTIER THEY DROWN US IN BEER 
GIVE US ELECTRIC SHOCKS WITH COPPER STRIPS FIRE WATER PISTOLS AT US 
AND THAT IS ONLY THE START I COULD GO ON ALL RIGHT I WILL 
THEY LEAVE HAIR AROUND SO WE GET CAUGHT UP AND THROTTLE OURSELVES 
FLUSH US DOWN THE TOILET DROP BRICKS ON OUR HEADS WHY DO THEY BOTHER 
ONE BREEZE AND I'M FATALLY DRIED OUT WHAT DID WE EVER DO TO HUMANS 
BESIDES NIBBLING THE ODD PLANT 
WE GET WALLOPED EVERY TIME WE HAVE A SALAD 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME I'M BEAUTIFUL 
LOOK AT ME AND MY LOVELY BREATHING HOLE I'M A PICTURE 
A BIT OF A STICKY ONE 
WELL YOU WANT TO GET SOME CLOTHES ON FOR A START WHERE'S YOUR SHELL 
SLUGS ARE SUCH SHOW OFFS SLUG PELLETS CAN KILL SNAILS AS WELL 
IT'S LIKE WE DON'T MATTER BRIAN DON'T GET YOURSELF WORKED UP 
LET'S PLAY LEAPFROG THAT'LL CHEER YOU UP YOU LOVE LEAPFROG 
COME ON PLEASE 
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD 
I WANT SNAILS TO BE APPRECIATED FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY CREATURES WE ARE 
I CAN LIFT TEN TIMES ME OWN WEIGHT UP A VERTICAL SURFACE 
WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE COS YOU'RE QUITE FAT BRIAN 
MY POINT IS HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO MEAN TO SUCH UNIQUE ANIMALS 
YOU'RE FORGETTING THE CABBAGE OH CABBAGE 
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO EAT YOUR CABBAGE DON'T PUT IT IN THE GARDEN 
I'LL PROBABLY GET IN TROUBLE FOR GETTING SLIME ON THE WINDOWS 
STILL I'M NOT ONE TO GO ON ABOUT IT I'M NOT A MOANER NO 
WHAT'S THAT 
SNAIL POWDER 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT I'M SO FLATTERED 
HUMANS HAVE INVENTED SOMETHING TO KILL ME AND NAMED IT AFTER ME 
BOB CAN YOU SEE THAT IT'S THE NICEST THING 
I THINK I'M GOING TO SHED A TEAR SNAIL POWDER 
IT'S FOR KILLING US IT'S NOT A COMPLIMENT 
THAT IS A BIT MEAN ISN'T IT SPECIAL POWDER TO KILL THOSE POOR SNAILS 
YOU'VE GOT TO REALLY HATE SOMETHING TO DO THAT 
LOOK AT THE REST OF THE SHELF THOUGH THERE'S ONE WITH MY NAME 
THERE'S ONE HERE ESPECIALLY FOR ME 
THERE'S ONE FOR JUST ABOUT EVERY MINI BEAST YOU'VE EVER HEARD OF 
WHAT DID WE EVER DO IT'S LIKE BEING SMALL MAKES YOU A TARGET 
IF HUMANS BOTHERED TO FIND OUT WE'RE LIKE WE ARE 
THEY WOULDN'T BE SO QUICK TO USE THIS LOT WHY DO THEY HATE ME 
IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE THEY SEE YOU BUZZING AROUND THEIR FOOD 
AND THEY THINK YOU SPREAD INFECTION I'M CLEANER THAN THEIR PETS 
BUT HOW DO YOU EAT YOUR FOOD I SPIT ON IT MASH IT ALL UP 
AND THEN I SUCK THE LIQUID THROUGH A TUBE IN MY FACE 
AND THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU A CLUE O. K. MY TABLE MANNERS AREN'T GREAT 
BUT WHAT HAVE THEY GOT AGAINST MY KIDS LOOK AT THEM WRIGGLING AWAY 
AREN'T THEY CUTE ALL SPONGY AND GLISTENING 
WHY IS EVERYONE SO SQUEAMISH IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO EAT YOU 
THEY'RE ONLY INTERESTED IN DEAD MEAT I'M FEELING A BIT QUEASY OH 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT YEAH JUST HAVING A LAUGH IT WASN'T FUNNY 
THE WAY HUMANS TREAT US YOU GOT TO LAUGH WHY DO THEY HATE US 
WE'VE GIVEN UP TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HUMANS THEY HATE CATERPILLARS 
BUT THEY LOVE BUTTERFLIES BUT WE'RE THE SAME THING AREN'T WE 
THEY DON'T WANT US EATING THEIR PLANTS 
BUT IF WE DIDN'T WE WOULDN'T TURN INTO BUTTERFLIES 
THE LENGTHS THEY GO TO TO STOP US 
THEY ACTUALLY POISON THEIR OWN FOOD 
WHAT 
THEY COVER FOOD THEY'RE PLANNING TO EAT WITH POISON TO KILL US 
NO IT'S TRUE WE'RE NOT GOING TO EAT POISONED CABBAGES ARE WE 
BUT THEY'VE GOT TO EAT IT WORK THAT OUT 
I THINK THEY WASH IT FIRST THOUGH 
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME TILL THIS CABBAGE GETS SPRAYED WHAT'LL WE DO 
EAT THE CABBAGE EAT THE CABBAGE EAT THE CABBAGE 
YOU KNOW THE WORST THING ABOUT BEING UNLOVED BEING MISUNDERSTOOD 
HUMANS HAVE GOT WASPS DOWN AS PSYCHOPATHIC SERIAL STINGERS 
EVEN US HORNETS IT'S SUCH ROT 
DON'T UPSET YOURSELF THEY'RE NOT WORTH IT O. K. ACCIDENTS DO HAPPEN 
AND WE MIGHT HANG AROUND A BIT IF THERE'S FOOD 
BUT IF YOU SAW AN ICE CREAM FOUR HUNDRED TIMES YOUR SIZE YOU'D CHECK IT OUT 
ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS MINT CHOC CHIP 
JUST LOOK AT THE TROUBLE WE GO TO TO STAY OUT OF THE WAY 
WE ALWAYS HIDE OUR NESTS 
WE DON'T GET ANY CREDIT FOR ALL OUR GOOD WORK IN THE INSECT COMMUNITY 
TAKE POLLINATION I MEAN US WASPS ARE KEY POLLINATORS 
THE PLANT KINGDOM COULDN'T DO WITHOUT US BUT WHO GETS THE CREDIT 
BEES 
YES COCKY LITTLE BEES OH WE'RE BEES WE'RE LOVELY 
WELL PROVOKE THEM AND YOU'LL KNOW ABOUT IT HAVE YOU SEEN A BEE SWARM 
GHASTLY AND IT'S TERRIFYING WHEN THEY'RE ALL LOOKING FOR A NEW HOUSE 
BUT DO BEES GET SLAUGHTERED IN THEIR THOUSANDS I DON'T THINK SO 
DO THEY GET ATTACKED FOR BEING BEES NO 
BUT ONE SMALL STINGING INCIDENT AROUND A CHOC ICE 
AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW IT'S HELLO IS THAT THE EXTERMINATOR 
AT LEAST BEES AND WASPS ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING TO ANNOY THE HUMANS 
SWARMING STINGING SCARING THEM 
BUT WE'RE REALLY CUTE AND STILL HUMANS FREAK WHEN THEY FIND US 
HUMANS SCARED OF US WHAT RUBBISH WE'RE TINY LOOK 
TRUST ME IT'S NO BUNDLE OF LAUGHS BEING TRAPPED IN A HOUSE 
A SPIDER INSIDE A HOUSE IS ONLY LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE TO HIDE 
HOUSES AREN'T THE BEST PLACES FOR SPIDERS DRY AND UNFRIENDLY 
THAT'S WHY WE PREFER CELLARS AND SHEDS FOR OUR WEBS 
WE'RE CALLED HOUSE SPIDERS BUT WE SHOULD BE CALLED SHED SPIDERS 
BUT YOU DO MESS UP THEIR HOUSES COVERING THEM WITH WEBS 
YOU CLEAN YOUR HOUSE ONE DAY AND NEXT MORNING WEBS EVERYWHERE 
THAT MUST BE ANNOYING NASTY STICKY THINGS NASTY STICKY THINGS 
YOU ARE A PHILISTINE LOOK AT THEM THEY'RE SILKEN WORKS OF ART 
GOSSAMER MASTERPIECES 
THAT'S THE BEST REASON YOU CAN COME UP WITH FOR HUMANS NOT LIKING US 
SETTING TRAPS THEN MURDERING OTHER INSECTS ISN'T EXACTLY FRIENDLY 
THERE'S NOTHING BEAUTIFUL ABOUT A WEB WHEN YOU'RE STUCK IN IT 
OH I SAY OH OH OOH 
WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE I WASN'T EXPECTING GUESTS FOR DINNER TONIGHT 
WHAT ARE WE HAVING YOU OH 
IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR IMAGE THIS REALLY ISN'T HELPING 
OH OH ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT INJECTING YOU 
WITH A MUSCLE LIQUEFYING POISON SO YOU DIE AN AGONISING DEATH 
MIGHT REFLECT BADLY ON ME JUST A SUGGESTION I'M DREADFULLY SORRY 
BUT I'M TOO HUNGRY TO WORRY ABOUT MY IMAGE RIGHT NOW 
IMAGE I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY IMAGE EVERYBODY LOVES ME 
HUMANS THINK THE SUN SHINES OUT OF OUR SPOTS CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF US 
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE ACTUALLY VICIOUS KILLERS M. M. M. APHIDS 
WELL IF I'VE GOT TO BE EATEN AT LEAST HE LOOKS NICE AAARGH 
COME HERE YOU OH GO ON THEN JUST COS IT'S YOU 
YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING IF YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT LOOKS 
MORNING MORNING 
MURDERED ANYONE HORRIBLY TODAY YES BUT I LOOKED LOVELY DOING IT 
HUMANS ARE VERY SHALLOW THEY THINK I LOOK NICE SO I MUST BE NICE 
I'M PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR INSECT IN THE WORLD BUT ALL I DO IS KILL 
LOVELY SO IF I GOT MYSELF A SNAZZY RED PAINT JOB 
AND A COUPLE OF SPOTS NO ONE WOULD MIND ME EATING THIS WORM GET OFF ME 
I RECKON IF IT WAS A POPULARITY CONTEST BETWEEN JUST US I'D WIN 
PEOPLE HATE WORMS YOU'RE A VERY MESSY EATER OH SHUSH 
I'M TRYING TO SUCK YOUR INSIDES OUT IT'S A HARD LIFE BEING A WORM 
TELL ME ABOUT IT I GET A LOAD OF STICK WHEN I LOOK LIKE A WORM 
BUT I'M LUCKY MY SPECIES GETS AN AUTOMATIC MAKEOVER WATCH 
TA RA THERE YOU GO SWEET 
IT'S WEIRD PEOPLE LIKE ME BUT NOT CATERPILLARS WE'RE THE SAME THING 
BUT I DO STILL MESS AROUND ON CABBAGES HARD HABIT TO BREAK 
NOBODY CARES THOUGH COS I LOOK NICE FUNNY OLD WORLD 
YOU SHOULD TURN INTO SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL AS WELL 
I'M TRYING I'M TRYING I'M SHEDDING MY SKIN HERE 
LET'S BE HONEST IF I WASN'T WINNING ANY BEAUTY CONTESTS BEFORE 
I'M NOT GOING TO START NOW 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL ABOUT LOOKS BE MORE FAMILY ORIENTED 
US EARWIGS ARE NOT PIN UPS BUT THE WAY WE LOOK AFTER OUR EGGS AND YOUNG 
SHOWS PEOPLE THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE SCARED OF US 
COME ON BATH TIME OH MUMMY YOU LICKED ME CLEAN LAST NIGHT 
THAT MIGHT WORK FOR YOU BUT NOT FOR US 
NURSERY WEB SPIDERS ARE JUST ABOUT THE MOST CARING FAMILY MINDED 
MINI BEAST IN THE WORLD LOOK AT ME WITH MY BABIES 
BUT WE'RE JUST AS UNLOVED AS ANY OTHER SPIDER I LOVE YOU MU M. 
WHAT'S AN ARACHNID GOT TO DO TO GET A BREAK AROUND HERE 
I DON'T CARE IF PEOPLE LIKE ME OR NOT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO 
LET ME GO NICE TRY I'M GOING TO CARRY ON DOING THINGS MY WAY 
EXACTLY WHY SHOULD WE CHANGE SO WHAT IF HUMANS DON'T LIKE US 
MAYBE WE DON'T LIKE THEM VERY MUCH EITHER 
THAT'S SETTLED LIKE IT OR LUMP IT WE'RE NOT CHANGING 
QUITE RIGHT WELL DONE I FEEL QUITE EMOTIONAL I'VE A TEAR IN MY EYE 
NO THAT'S MUCUS 
BE OFF WITH YOU REALLY YES GO ON GO AWAY OH THANK YOU 
I'LL NEVER SAY A BAD THING ABOUT A SPIDER AGAIN BYE 
HOW ABOUT A GAME OF LEAPFROG NO 
YOU WANT TO COME OUT YOUR SHELL MORE VERY FUNNY
