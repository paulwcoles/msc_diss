MISSSING.LIVE AT B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U. K. JANE 
JANE ASHER WILL BE HERE TO TALK 
ABOUT HOW PEOPLE WITH AUTISM ARE 
VULNERABLE TO GOING MISSING BUT 
FIRST A REUNITED STORY HIS MUM 
KNEW HE WAS OUT OF SORTS WHEN HE 
GOT UP AND LEFT A QUIZ NIGHT SHE 
DIDN'T EXPECT HER SON TO GO MISSING 
SHIRLEY AND BEARRY SHEER LIVE IN 
WEST SUSSEX BARRY SHIER THEY 
MARRY IN NINETEEN SIXTY AND HAVE MARTIN 
FOUR YEARS LATER 
MARTIN'S FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS ARE 
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER CHILD BUT BY 
THE TIME HE IS THREE SHIRLEY KNOWS 
SOMETHING ISN'T QUITE RIGHT THE THE PLAY GROUP HE WENT TO NOTICED HE 
WASN'T FUNCTIONING IN PLAY WITH THE 
OTHER CHILDREN HE WASN'T JOINING 
IN WITH ANYTHING 
BY THE TIME SHE 
HE IS AT SCHOOL HIS SYMPTOMS ARE 
MORE WORRYING 
HE SHOWED NO FEAR OF 
FIRE AND HE WAS PUTTING HID HAND IN 
CANDLES AND HE SHOWED NO FEAR WITH 
THAT AT ALL 
DETERMINED TO FIND 
ANSWERS ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOUR 
MARTIN'S PARENTS GET HIM THE 
PROFESSIONAL HELP HE NEEDS 
HE WENT 
TO A PLACE CALLED THE CHILD 
GUIDANCE CLICKIC AND THEY DIAGNOSED 
HIM AUZO AS AWE US THE TICK BUT HE 
WAS NINE BY THE TIME THEY FULLY 
DIAGNOSED HIM AUTISM IS A BRITAIN 
DEVELOPMENT DISORDER THAT AFFECTS 
ONE IN ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE U. K. IT 
CAUSES PEOPLE TO HAVE DIFFICULTY 
WITH SOCIAL INTERACTION 
THEY CAN 
HAVE EMOTIONAL AND LANGUAGE 
PROBLEMS TO PEOPLE WITH THE 
CONDITION LIKE MARTIN THE WORLD 
CAN APPEAR A BE WILLERING PLACE IT 
IS THE SEVENTIES LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT 
AUTISM AND MARTIN IS OFTEN SINGLED 
OUT 
HE WAS SEVERELY BULLIED AT THE OUT SENIOR SCHOOL 
BY THE AGE OF FIFTEEN 
THE STRUGGLE WITH HIS DISABILITY 
AND THE WORLD HE IS LIVING IN 
BECOMES A PROBLEM FOR MARTIN HE HE SAT ON THE END OF THE BED ONE DAY 
WITH ME AND HE CRIED AND HE HE 
HAS ON CRIED IN ABOUT THREE TIME 
HE SAID MUM WHEN IS THIS GOING TO 
STOP THROUGH THE BULLYING THEY 
DECIDED THAT HE WOULD PROBABLY BE 
BETTER OFF IN A RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL 
THAT WAS BETTER BECAUSE THE CLASSES 
WERE SMALLER 
FINALLY HE GETS THE 
ROUND THE CLOCK CARE HE NEEDS AND 
THE QUALITY OF MARTIN'S LIFE 
IMPROVES HIS MUM SHIRLEY NOTICED 
THE DIFFERENCE OCCASIONALLY HE 
WILL GIVE YOU A HUG 
WHICH IS 
QUITE UNUSUAL FOR AN AUTISTIC 
PERSON TO DO AND HE HAS COME UP TO 
ME AND SAID I LOVE YOU MUM YOU 
KNOW AND THAT IS JUST AMAZING 
WHEN THAT HAPPENS 
AS AWARENESS OF 
AUTISM AND ITS TREATMENT IMPROVES 
MARTIN BECOMES HAPPEN YES AND MORE 
SETTLED THROUGH HIS TWENTIES AND THIRTIES 
HE LIVES IN DIFFERENT CARE HOMES 
AND TRAVELS WITH HIS MUM AND DAD 
BY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN MARTIN'S CONTENTED WITH A 
FAMILIAR ROUTINE AND REGULAR 
CONTACT WITH HIS FAMILY BUT ON 
JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND SEVEN MARTIN IS OUT OF 
SORTS 
SOMETHING UPSET HIM I THINK SORTS OR HE WAS UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING BUT 
WE COULDN'T GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT 
SHIRLEY PLANS TO TAKE MARTIN TO A 
QUIZ NIGHT AT A LOCAL CARE CENTRE 
HE KNOWS A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE AND 
IT MIGHT HELP HIM TO COME OUT OF 
WHATEVER HE IS THINKING ABOUT AND 
RAISE HIM UP A LITTLE BIT 
AFTER AN 
HOUR MARTIN GETS UP AND LEAVES THE 
ROOM HE DIDN'T COME BACK AND 
ROOM ONE OF THE STAFF CAME OVER TO ME 
AND SAID I THINK I HAVE JUST SEEN 
MARTIN GO OUT THE FRONT DOOR L. 
JUMPED UP AND CHASED OUT TO SEE IF 
I COULD FIND HIM HE HAD GONE 
ALL LOOKED ROUND THE GROUNDS AND 
EVERYWHERE L. L. COULDN'T FIND 
ANYTHING SO WE ALERTED THE POLICE 
EVERYONE SUDDENLY REALISES MARTIN 
HAS VANISHED STILL TO COME ON 
MISSING LIVE A MASSIVE LAND AND 
AIR SEARCH IS LAUNCHED 
MY CONCERNS 
GREW EVERY DAY OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE 
LIKE MARTIN WITH AUTISM IS 
EXTRAORDINARILY VULNERABLE 
AS NIFER DOGS JOIN THE SEARCH HAVE 
POLICE FINALLY TRACKED HIM DOWN 
SNIFFER 
HE FITTED THE DESCRIPTION SNIFFER THE SAME BUILD EVEN THE SAME SORT 
OF CLOTHING 
WE WILL HAVE MORE ON 
THAT STORY LATER IF YOU HAVE A 
SIMILAR STORY PLEASE E. MAIL US AT 
MALCOLM CHRISTIE JANE ASHER IS 
HERE WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE 
NATIONAL AUTISTIC SOCIETY MORNING 
I KNOW YOU KNOW A BIT ABOUT MORE 
MARTIN'S STORERY HOW WOULD HIS 
AUTISM HAVE AFFECTED HIM AND WHY 
WOULD THAT MAKE HIM GO MISSING 
AUTISM IS A VERY BROAD SPECTRUM L. 
COVERS A HUGE RANGE OF DISABILITIES 
SO IT IS HARD TO TALK ABOUT ONE 
INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE IT IS EXTREMELY 
VARIABLE BUT A THREAD THAT RUNS 
THROUGH AUTISM IS A COMPLETE LACK 
OF SOCIAL AWARENESS AND SOCIAL 
COMMUNICATION AND ALSO A LOVE OF 
ROUTINE SO THE FACT THAT CLEARLY 
MARTIN'S ROUTINE WAS DESTROYED ONCE 
HE WANDERED OFF WOULD HAVE MADE HIS 
VERY CONFUSED VERY VULNERABLE AND 
UNABLE TO ASK FOR THE SORT OF HELP 
THAT YOU OR I MIGHT DO IN THAT KIND 
OF SITUATION 
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN 
WHY HE SEEMED TO STAY PUT IN ONE 
PLACE 
I AM SURE HE WAS VERY FRIGHT PLACE ANDED AND DISORIENTED AND MAY 
EXPLAIN WHY HE FELT SAFEST KEEPING 
STILL AND ASSUMING THAT MUM WOULD 
FIND HIM THAT IS WHAT HAS ALWAYS 
HAPPENED BEFORE IF HE WAS IN 
TROUBLE IF HE WAS UNSURE WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING MUM WOULD COME AND LOOK 
AFTER HIM OR ONE OF HIS CARERS 
WOULD FIND HIM SO IT MIGHT BE HARD 
TO UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE HE WAS 
IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION IT WOULD 
BE DIFFICULT FOR SOMEBODY TO FIND 
HIM HE MIGHT HAVE ASSUMED SOMEBODY 
WILL COME AND LOOK AFTER ME ALSO ALSO WE TALK A LOT ABOUT AUTISTIC 
CHILDREN AND THERE ARE MANY ADULTS 
AS WELL 
WELL THERE ARE AS MANY 
ADULTS AS CHILDREN BECAUSE IT IS A 
LIFELONG CONDITION ALTHOUGH THE 
SYMPTOMS CAN BE HUGELY MITIGATED BY 
THE RIGHT SUPPORT AND CARE THE 
UNDERLYING AUTISM IS INCURABLE SO 
THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS A CHILD WITH 
AUTISM WILL BECOME AN ADULT WITH 
AUTISM AS WITH MANY CONDITIONS I 
THINK IT CAN BE VERY TOUGH AS YOU 
GET OLDER YOU MAYBE A VERY CUTE 
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CHILD WITH AUTISM 
AND YOU MAY GROW INTO A DIFFICULT 
TEENAGER WHO FINDS IT HARDER TO 
COPE WITH THE WORLD BECAUSE THE 
OLDER THE HOARE MOANS ARE KICK IN 
THE WORLD CAN BE UNFORGIVING 
DO YOU 
THINK THINGS ARE CHANGING THE WAY 
CHILDREN WITH AUTISM ARE TAUGHT 
ABSOLUTELY NOW WE KNOW HOW TO MAKE 
SOMEBODY'S LIFE FULL OF DIGNITY 
GETTING IT CAN STILL BE MINE 
FIELD AND WE KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE 
TO FIGHT TO GET WHAT IS THEIR RIGHT 
TO GET THE CORRECT SUPPORT L. SEE A 
LOT OF ADULTS PERHAPS PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE ONLY BEEN DIAGNOSED IN THEIR 
FIFTY SIXTIES SEVENTY WHO ARE DEEPLY 
DISTRESSED HAVE EXTREMELY 
CHALLENGING BEHAVIOUR BECAUSE THEY 
NEVER HAD HAD THAT SUPPORT ONE 
OF MY GREAT WISHS IS THAT EVERY 
CHILD COULD HAVE THE RIGHT SUPPORT 
AND HELP SO I DON'T EVER HAVE TO 
SEE AGAIN ADULTS IN DEEP DESPAIR 
AND MISSING AS WELL AND MISSING 
THANK YOU

ONE AREA WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF 
WOODED AREA AND IT WAS ENORMOUS AS AS THE SECOND DAY DRAWS ON IT IS 
BECOMING CLEAR THAT SEARCHES ON 
FOOT AREN'T ENOUGH 
WE CALLED IN 
THE HELICOPTER TO USE A HEAT 
SEEKING DEVICE TO TRY AND FIND 
MARTIN IN THE BUSHES BECAUSE WE 
HAD A VAST AREA TO COVER THE THE GROUND SEARCH ALSO CONTINUES AS 
POLICE KNOCK ON OVER THREE HUNDRED DOORS

AND HOW HE WAS FOUND LATER LAST LAST WEEK WE BROUGHT YOU THE CASE OF 
TWO YEAR OLD KATRICE LEE WHO 
VANISHED FROM A SUPERMARKET THAT 
WAS TWENTY SIX YEARS AGO MIKE HAS 
DEVELOPED A SYSTEM THAT COULD HELP 
THAT INVESTIGATION WHAT IS THIS 
SYSTEM 
IT IS SOFTWARE WE USE TO SYSTEM ANALYSE C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE THE POLICE 
USE IT TO HELP THEIR INVESTIGATION 
INTO MISSING PEOPLE MURDER AND 
OTHER CRIMES WE PLOT EVERY PIXEL 
CHANGE AND USING AN EQUATION WE CAN 
DETERMINE MOVEMENT AND HEIGHT AND 
WIDTH 
IT SOUNDS COMPLICATED WE WIDTH HAVE SOME FOOTAGE THAT YOU CAN TALK 
US THROUGH WHAT IS HAPPENING THIS THIS A TYPICAL C. C. T. V. PEOPLE ARE MOVING 
IN AND OUT OF A DOOR YOU COULD 
HAVE A THOUSAND PEOPLE GOING IN AND 
OUT F. YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A CHILD 
YOU WANT TO EXCLUDE THE ADULT AND 
HONE IS ON THE CHILD 
SO YOUR 
SYSTEM CAN IDENTIFY IN A COMPUTER 
WAY WHO WAS A CHILD WHO IS AN 
ADULT AND YOU SEE A CHILD THEN THE 
ABELS COWL RING SMOO 
IN THAT FIRST 
FEW HOURS IT IS CRITICAL TO EXCLUDE 
AS MANY AS POSSIBLE IT MAY BE A 
PERSON OR A VEHICLE THE POLICE USE 
IT FOR DIFFERENT SCENARIOS THE THE POLICE ARE USING IT NOWSOME 
YES FORTY EIGHT 
OF THE U. K. POLICE FORCES ARE 
CUSTOMERS 
WELL IT IS A FASCINATING CUSTOMERS SYSTEM ANOTHER FASCINATING THING 
IS THE STORY ABOUT YOU YOU HAVE 
YOUR OWN STORY

TO THE CASE OF STEVE COOK NINE 
MONTHS HAVE PASSED WITH A GARBLED 
VOICE DOWN A TELEPHONE BE THE CLUE 
THAT HIS PARENTS ARE WAITING FOR 
STEVEN COOK IS TWENTY THREE AT THE END OF 
AUGUST TWO THOUSAND FIVE HE GOES TO CRETE FOR A 
A HOLIDAY THEY ARE STAYING IN 
MALIA A RESORT THAT IS POPULAR 
WITH YOUNG TOURISTS AFTER AN 
EVENING OUT STEVEN DOES NOT RETURN 
BY TEND OF THE DAY HIS FRIENDS 
REPORT HIM MISSING TO GREEK POLICE 
HIS PARENTS FLY TO CRETE TO SEARCH 
FOR HIM THEY VIDEO EVERYTHING THEY 
DO ALTHOUGH STEVEN GOES MISSING IN 
GREECE BRITISH POLICE LAUNCH THEIR 
OWN INVESTIGATION 
A LOT OF INFORMATION WAS U. K. BASED 
HE WAS WITH U. K. HOLIDAY COMPANY HE WAS WITH GROUP OF FRIENDS FROM 
THE AREA SO WE WERE ABLE TO PULL 
TOGETHER DOSSIER OF INTELLIGENCE 
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL STARTING POINT FOR THE GREEK POLICE 
WE WERE ABLE TO TRACK THEM WE 
INTERVIEWED PEOPLE WHO MET ONE 
STEVEN AND HIS FRIENDS SPOKE TO 
THEM BEEN DRINKING WITH THEM IN 
VARIOUS BARS AND UP TO THE POINT 
WHERE STEVE AND ONE OF HIS FRIENDS 
LEFT THE MAIN GROUP TO GO BACK TO 
THE HOTEL THEY WERE STAYING AT IT 
IS IMPORTANT TO RETRACE STEVEN'S 
STEPS ON THAT NIGHT THERE IS A 
WITNESS 
STEVEN WAS LAST SEEN WITNESS STANDING OUTSIDE A PARTICULAR BAR 
LOOKING FOR DIRECTIONS BACK TO THE 
HOTEL WHICH WAS A MATTER ONLY OF A 
FEW ONE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY BUT 
NONETHELESS A PLACE THAT WASN'T 
PARTICULARLY EASY TO WALK TO IF YOU 
WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE TOWN 
THIS IS THE LAST TIME THAT STEVEN 
IS SEEN THAT NIGHT IN NOVEMBER 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE TWO MONTHS AFTER HE 
DISAPPEARS HIS PARENTS DECIDE TO 
MAKE THEIR OWN JOURNEY TO CRETE AND 
SEARCH FOR THEMSELVES 
I SPENT SOMETHING LIKE SIX WEEKS OR 
SO LOOKING AT MAPS TRYING TO GET 
AN IDEA OF SCALE AND I WAS QUITE 
OPTIMISTIC WE WOULD GO OUT AND WE 
WILL ACHIEVE SOMETHING THEY THEY RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM SOMEONE IN 
CRETE THAT A YOUNG MAN IS LIVING 
IN DISUSED MINES AND CAVES INLAND 
BUT THEY FIND NOTHING THERE TO LEAD 
THEM TO STEVEN NORMAN AND PAT 
RETURN TO ENGLAND WITH NO ANSWERS 
NINE MONTHS PASS WITH NO NEWS THEN 
IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIX THAT ADDS TO THE 
MYSTERY OF THE CASE 
ONE CALL CAME 
THROUGH TO NORMAN AND PAT COOK AND 
IT CAME FROM A FOREIGN NUMBER AND 
THERE WAS NO PARTICULAR MESSAGE BUT 
AGAIN IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE 
IMMEDIATELY JUMPED ON TO FOLLOW UP 
PAT ANSWERS THE PHONE AND SHE GETS 
A GARBLED SORT OF NOISE I CAN BEST 
EX PLAIN THE PHONE WENT DEAD SO 
PAT RANG ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE AND THE MESSAGE WAS 
DIFFERENT TO THE NORMAL MESSAGE OF 
A PHONE CALL IN THE U. K. AND WE 
IDENTIFIED IT AS AN INTERNATIONAL 
CALL 
WE TRACED THAT CALL TO AN CALL EXCHANGE IN THE DUSSELDORF AREA OF 
GERMANY THAT CALLED COULD HAVE 
BEEN MADE BY ANY PERSON FOR ANY 
REASON IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY 
WHO WAS JUST OFFERING A MESSAGE OF 
SUPPORT ON THE OTHER HAND IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN STEVEN TRYING TO 
MAKE CONTACT WITH HIS FAMILY IN 
THE ABSENCE OF ANY FIRM EVIDENCE 
IT IS STILL SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE 
TO GET TO 
THE BOTTOM OF ALTHOUGH ALTHOUGH THE CALL IS TRACKED TO GERMANY THE 
TELEPHONE IT IS MADE FROM IS NOT 
LOCATED WHEN TRACED THE DETAILS 
OF THE NUMBER ARE INCONCLUSIVE 
THE FAMILY REFUSE TO GIVE UP HOPE 
WANTING TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO 
PUBLICISE THE CASE WORLDWIDE THEY 
HAVE SET UP A WEBSITE 
THE INTERNET 
HAS PLAYED A MASSIVE MASSIVE ROLE 
I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME SEE HOW 
WE WOULD A. I. B. TO TOUCH AND REACH AS 
MANY PEOPLE ABLE AS EFFECTIVELY 
AND EFFICIENTLY AS OFTENS WE HAVE 
DONE WITHOUT THE WEB

E. MAIL THAT IS LINKED TO THE 
WEBSITE N. THE EARLY DAU WE WERE 
GETTING SOMETHING IN THE ORDER OF 
SEVERAL HUNDRED OR SO A DAY IT IT HELPS AN AWFUL LOT AND THERE IS 
ALWAYS THAT POSSIBILITY THAT IT

INFORMATION AND THERE ARE A LOT OF 
E. MAILS ON THIS SITE THAT I HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO PASS ON THE THE 
CHESHIRE POLICE 
THE COOKS' LIVES HAVE BEEN IN LIMBO
