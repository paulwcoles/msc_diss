DON'T BE TOO SURE 
I'M SORRY I'VE NOT BEEN SLEEPING WELL LATELY 
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU COULD RECOMMEND ANYTHING FOR THAT SOME PILLS OR SOMETHING 
WELL ARE YOU UNDER ANY STRESS AT THE MOMENT

ANDREW FORD WALK DON'T RUN 
HAVE YOU DONE IT 
YOU KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T 
HEY YOU'RE REALLY TENSE 
I'M FINE NO YOU'RE NOT WHAT'S UP 
I ALMOST TOLD MEL THIS MORNING 
I'D BEEN AWAKE HALF THE NIGHT THINKING ABOUT WHAT TO SAY BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO IT 
I JUST COULDN'T 
I'M SORRY HEY LISTEN YOU DON'T EVER NEED TO APOLOGISE 
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TO SAY WHEN THE TIME'S RIGHT 
AND RIGHT NOW SEEING AS WE DON'T HAVE ANY CLASSES TO TEACH 
WE CAN'T ANYONE COULD COME IN 
NOT IF I LOCK THE DOOR 
A TYPICAL DAY WOULD START ERM 
MORNING SURGERY STARTS AT NINE A M. SO THERE'S NOT MUCH CHANCE OF A LIE IN 
IF YOU'VE BEEN UP LATE THE NIGHT BEFORE 
ERM MOST OF MY AFTERNOONS ARE USUALLY SPENT DOING HOME VISITS 
OR CATCHING UP ON PAPERWORK BEFORE AFTERNOON SURGERY 
WHICH THEN FINISHES AT SIX 
HI 
I JUST WONDERED IF THERE WAS ANYTHING YOU NEED ANOTHER DRINK 
SANDWICH MAYBE 
CAN WE TALK ABOUT YESTERDAY 
COURSE 
I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND A LOT OF WHAT THE CONSULTANT SAID WELL O. K. 
ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR CARDIOMYOPATHY IS WHEN 
WELL HOW ABOUT WE JUST CALL IT ARVC 
O. K. SO ARVC IS 
WHEN DAMAGED HEART MUSCLE IS GRADUALLY REPLACED BY SCAR TISSUE AND FAT 
NOW SOMETIMES THIS CAN CAUSE ABNORMAL ELECTRICAL HEART RHYTHMS 
WHICH WEAKEN THE PUMPING ACTION OF THE HEART 
LOTS OF PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH ARVC LEAD PERFECTLY NORMAL LIVES 
NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW THAT THEY HAD GOT IT 
BUT IF MY HEART'S NOT WORKING PROPERLY 
EVEN SO IN MOST CASES IT DOESN'T LIMIT THE QUALITY OR THE DURATION OF THOSE PEOPLE'S LIVES 
WHAT IF I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE CASES 
THEY'RE THE VAST MAJORITY 
BUT IF 
IT COULD KILL ME COULDN'T IT 
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON LEAVE IT MATE PLEASE 
WHAT'S GOING ON 
HE SAW US 
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO SO WHAT 
HE LIVES JUST ROUND THE CORNER FROM ME AND MEL 
HE KNOWS WHERE WE LIVE HE SAW YOU AND ME KISSING 
SO SO HE SAW US THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN THIS 
HE'S FINDING HIS ENGLISH COURSEWORK HARD HE'D NEVER GET A DECENT GRADE SO 
I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR HIM IN RETURN FOR HIM NOT TELLING MEL 
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU PUTTING YOUR JOB AT RISK BY FALSIFYING COURSEWORK 
ALLOWING SOME KID TO BLACKMAIL YOU 
YOU KNOW THERE'S AN EASY WAY TO SORT THIS WHAT JUST TELL MEL 
LOOK GAVIN IF YOU'RE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS NO NO DON'T BE LIKE THAT 
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU 
IF IT WAS JUST MEL I'D HAVE TOLD HER MONTHS AGO BUT THE KIDS 
I NEED TO EXPLAIN I CAN'T JUST WALK OUT ON HER 
SHE'D MAKE SURE I NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN 
I KNOW 
LEAVE IT TO ME 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING 
WHERE DO YOU THINK 
THERE'S NO WAY I'M LETTING ANDREW FORD SCREW UP YOUR LIFE 
JACE DON'T JASON 
A LOT OF PATIENTS WITH ARVC NEVER DEVELOP SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS 
AND ANYWAY THEY'RE ALL TREATABLE 
EMILY SUDDEN DEATH 
WHAT 
YESTERDAY 
THE CONSULTANT SAID THERE WAS A RISK OF SUDDEN DEATH 
THAT COULD HAPPEN TO ME COULDN'T IT 
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS WE CAN DO TO MINIMISE THE RISK OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENING 
SUDDEN DEATH IS MOST LIKELY TO HAPPEN WITH UNDIAGNOSED CASES 
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THOSE PEOPLE ARE AT RISK 
BUT YOU'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED 
IT COULD STILL HAPPEN 
THE DOCTORS WILL DO SOME TESTS TO FIND OUT THE PARTICULAR LEVEL OF RISK THAT YOU'RE AT 
AND THAT WILL DETERMINE THE TREATMENT THAT YOU GET THERE ARE DRUGS YOU CAN TAKE 
A FEW LIFESTYLE CHANGES THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE 
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS REDUCING YOUR INTAKE OF CAFFEINE OR ALCOHOL 
SO NO MORE BINGE DRINKING I'M AFRAID 
AND YOU NEED TO AVOID RIGOROUS EXERCISE 
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME 
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS DEATH SENTENCE 
IT'S NOT YOU'RE NOT LISTENING 
IT'S BECAUSE I KILLED THE BABY ISN'T IT IT'S BECAUSE I HAD THE ABORTION 
I'M BEING PUNISHED 
NO DARLING IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING IT JUST 
WELL IT JUST IS THAT'S ALL 
AND NOW WE KNOW WHAT IT IS WE CAN DO WHATEVER IS NEEDED 
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LIVE A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE 
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF SUPPORT GROUPS AND CHARITIES TO HELP PEOPLE WHO'VE GOT ARVC 
AND YOU CAN STAY HERE WITH ME AND DANIEL WHILE YOU GET WHATEVER TREATMENT THAT YOU NEED 
I MEAN THAT'S TWO DOCTORS AT YOUR BECK AND CALL 
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE GET THAT LEVEL OF SERVICE 
BUT WHAT ABOUT COLLEGE AND WORK AND MUM WE HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD HER YET 
WELL DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT 
YOU GO AND REST AND WE'LL SORT THAT OUT 
INCLUDING YOUR MOTHER 
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU 
BOTH OF US 
LIFE IS THE SAME AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE HEY HEY HEY 
EASY AS PICKING FOXES FROM A TREE HEY HEY HEY 
BUT I CAN'T GET NO SATISFACTION 
ALL I WANT IS EASY ACTION 
O. I. I WANT A WORD WITH YOU 
YEAR ELEVEN DIDN'T GIVE YOU TOO MUCH OF A HARD TIME THEN 
NOTHING I COULDN'T HANDLE SOUNDS LIKE WE COULD DO WITH YOU HERE MORE OFTEN 
EXCUSE ME I'D BETTER SORT THIS OUT

DOCTOR CLAY

MR. PETERSON COULD YOU CALL AN AMBULANCE PLEASE 
MR. PETERSON CALL NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE RIGHT 
YOU JUST RELAX AND TAKE IT EASY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY 
NICK I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT HIM 
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO AND SEE HIM AS SOON AS I GOT BACK FROM THE STATES 
I'VE JUST BEEN SO WRAPPED UP IN MY OWN PROBLEMS AND POOR NICK IS JUST 
I'M SURE HE'LL UNDERSTAND YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO SEE HIM 
HOW IS HE 
HE'S DOING VERY WELL HE'S LIKE YOU 
HE DOESN'T GIVE UP EASILY 
I'LL BE BACK 
HE HAS TWO FRACTURED RIBS 
IT'S GOING TO BE PAINFUL FOR A WHILE BUT HE'S GOING TO BE O. K. 
YES HE WAS VERY LUCKY THOUGH 
WHAT KIND OF A KID IS HE 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WELL DOES HE GET HIMSELF INTO TROUBLE PICK FIGHTS WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
NO HE'S THE NICEST KID IN THE WORLD REALLY WHY 
IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT ANDREW'S INJURIES WERE ACCIDENTAL 
I WONDERED IF YOU HAD ANY IDEA OF HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED NO 
THE THING IS I SAW HIM WITH YOUR COLLEAGUE JASON 
THEY OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T THINK ANYONE COULD SEE THEM AND I'M NOT ACCUSING JASON 
BUT THEY WERE ARGUING ABOUT SOMETHING 
ARE YOU O. K. DO YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN NO I'M O. K. THANKS 
JOE HI IT'S JULIA HOW ARE YOU DOING 
OH YOU KNOW RIGHT LISTEN 
I JUST WONDERED IF YOU KNEW WHEN YOU WERE COMING BACK TO WORK I DON'T KNOW YET IT'S JUST 
IF IT'S GOING TO BE MORE THAN A FEW DAYS I'LL HAVE TO GET A LOCUM IN 
AND YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT THAT CAN BE SOMETIMES AT SHORT NOTICE 
I JUST WONDERED IF YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME SORT OF IDEA YOU KNOW 
I MEAN I DO UNDERSTAND THAT EMILY'S VISIT WAS UNEXPECTED BUT ERM 
JULIA WHEN I SAY I DON'T KNOW IT MEANS I DON'T KNOW 
WHEN I DO YOU WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE I CALL 
JOE IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT 
WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE ANYTHING URGENT WELL NO I WAS ONLY JUST 
I'LL BE IN TOUCH O. K. 
LOOK HE'S GOING TO BE O. K. ISN'T HE 
WOULD IT BOTHER YOU IF HE WASN'T 
YOU THINK I DID THIS TO HIM 
DID YOU IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK I'M CAPABLE OF WAS IT YOU 
I HAD A WORD WITH HIM THAT'S ALL YOU SERIOUSLY THINK I'D HIT A KID

BUT AFTER WHAT YOU SAID NO NO GAV GAV YOU'VE GOT PROBLEMS MATE 
AND IF YOU DON'T TRUST ME 
WELL THEN WE'VE BOTH GOT PROBLEMS HAVEN'T WE 
SO WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WHAT'S IT GOT TO DO WITH YOU ANYWAY 
WELL IF YOU WERE ASSAULTED I WAS PLAYING FOOTBALL 
YOU WANT TO BE MORE CAREFUL GETTING INJURIES LIKE THAT WHO WERE YOU PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH 
YOU SAID I'LL BE FINE SO WHO CARES 
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT HAS ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPENED BEFORE NO 
WHAT ARE YOU SCARED OF I AIN'T SCARED OF ANYTHING

YEAH THE SCHOOL CALLED HIM 
I DON'T WANT HIM HERE I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM O. K. CALM DOWN 
DON'T LET HIM IN PLEASE 
WHAT DO I VALUE ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP ERM 
IT'S PROBABLY EASIER FOR ME TO SAY WHAT I USED TO VALUE 
IT USED TO BE TRUST 
BEFORE ALL THAT WAS BETRAYED 
I THINK YOU'LL AGREE WITH ME THAT THESE SESSIONS ARE NOT GOING TO HELP US MOVE FORWARD 
IF WHAT HAPPENED WITH NICK IS ALWAYS RAISED AND HELD AGAINST ME 
AND I'M SURE YOU'D AGREE THAT A HOLIER THAN THOU APPROACH ISN'T CONSTRUCTIVE 
ESPECIALLY WHEN AN INCIDENT INVOLVING ME AND ANOTHER WOMAN WAS HELD AGAINST ME FOR OVER A YEAR 
AND IT WAS ONE KISS 
MUM AND DAD SPLIT UP LAST YEAR 
AFTER DAD MOVED OUT I STARTED GETTING REALLY BAD GRADES 
HE TRIED TO HELP ME BUT WHEN MY RESULTS DIDN'T GET ANY BETTER 
HE STARTED TO HIT ME 
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT I'D JUST BE ABLE TO CATCH UP AND HE'D STOP 
BUT HE DIDN'T IT JUST GOT WORSE 
AND THAT'S WHEN 
HAS HE BEEN DOING ANYTHING ELSE NO ARE YOU SURE BECAUSE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE 
I'VE BEEN BLACKMAILING MR. PETERSON 
HE'S BEEN DOING MY ENGLISH COURSEWORK 
IT'S MY WORST SUBJECT I'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD AT EVERYTHING ELSE 
I EVEN SKIPPED GAMES THIS MORNING TO GO HOME AND WORK ON MY MATHS 
I HATE MATHS 
I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE WAS GOING TO BE THERE BUT DAD WAS COLLECTING SOME OF HIS THINGS AND 
WELL LOOK I CAN'T STOP YOUR DAD SEEING YOU 
I CAN TRY TO DELAY HIM BUT TO GET THIS TO STOP SPEAK TO THE POLICE 
IT'LL ONLY MAKE THINGS WORSE HE'LL GO BALLISTIC AND IF YOU DON'T 
WHEN WILL THIS STOP AFTER A FEW MORE TIMES IN HOSPITAL 
OR WHEN YOU'RE SO SCARED IT'S NOT FUN FOR HIM ANY MORE 
I'M SORRY BUT SPEAKING TO THE POLICE IS THE ONLY WAY 
MR. PETERSON WHAT ABOUT HIM 
HELLO YOU

THEY NEVER SEEM TO REALISE THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET WHAT THEY WANT WITHOUT CAUSING THE PAIN ANYWAY 
OH I NEARLY FORGOT 
ANDREW SAID TO SAY HE WAS SORRY 
I'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE POLICE ABOUT HIS INJURIES AND WHAT HE SAID ABOUT HIS FATHER 
BUT HE ALSO TOLD ME A FEW OTHER THINGS 
I'LL HAVE TO GO AND SEE THE HEAD

ANDREW WILL GET THE EXTRA SUPPORT AND TUITION HE NEEDS 
YOU SEEM A BIT MORE RELAXED THAN YOU WERE THIS MORNING YES I SUPPOSE I AM
