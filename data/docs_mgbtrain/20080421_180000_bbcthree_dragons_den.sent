OF DOZENS OF BUDDING ENTREPRENEURS 
I THINK IT'D BE YEARS BEFORE YOUR BUSINESS WOULD GENERATE A MILLION POUNDS IN PROFIT 
I JUST DON'T THINK YOU'VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH THIS IS JUST NOT A BUSINESS 
IF YOU THINK YOU ARE GONNA GET AN INVESTMENT FROM ME YOU ARE LIVING IN FANTASY LAND 
I LOVE IT 
THE DRAGONS HAVE ALL IT TAKES TO BE SUCCESSFUL 
FIVE OF BRITAIN'S MOST ENTERPRISING AND WEALTHY BUSINESS PEOPLE 
THEY HAVE ALL BUILT UP THEIR OWN FORTUNES FROM SCRATCH 
JAMES CAAN MADE HIS MILLIONS 
BUILDING A GLOBAL BUSINESS IN THE RECRUITMENT INDUSTRY 
AND HE NOW HEADS AN INTERNATIONAL PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM 
THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION BUSINESS EMPIRE OF GLASWEGIAN ENTREPRENEUR 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE INCLUDE HOTELS CASINOS AND HEALTH CLUBS 
DEBORAH MEADEN EARNED HER FORTUNE IN THE HOLIDAY AND LEISURE INDUSTRY IN THE WEST COUNTRY 
THEO PAPHITIS IS A RETAIL MAGNATE WHO'S TRANSFORMED THE FORTUNES 
OF HIGH STREET BRANDS LIKE RYMAN LA SENZA PARTNERS AND CONTESSA 
AND ONE OF BRITAIN'S BEST KNOWN ENTREPRENEURS PETER JONES 
HAS BUILT UP A MULTI MILLION POUND EMPIRE 
WITH A BUSINESS PORTFOLIO THAT RANGES FROM TELECOMS AND LEISURE TO PROPERTY AND MEDIA 
IN THE DEN THE DRAGONS ARE READY TO BACK THE RIGHT BUSINESSES WITH THEIR OWN MONEY 
BUT TONIGHT WILL ANYONE CONVINCE THEM TO INVEST 
ONCE AGAIN 
MORE NERVOUS ENTREPRENEURS HAVE GATHERED HERE IN THE DRAGONS' DEN 
THEY'VE ALL GOT BUSINESS IDEAS THEY THINK COULD MAKE THEIR FORTUNES 
BUT EVERY ONE OF THEM NEEDS CASH BACKING FOR THEIR VENTURE 
OUR MULTI MILLIONAIRE DRAGONS ARE PREPARED TO INVEST BUT REMEMBER THEY'RE RISKING THEIR OWN MONEY 
SO THEY'LL ONLY GO FOR THE VERY BEST IDEAS 
HOW WILL OUR FIRST ENTREPRENEUR FARE UNDER THE DRAGONS' SCRUTINY 
HELLO MY NAME'S MAX MCMURDO I'M HERE TODAY TO PITCH FOR FIFTY THOUSAND 
FOR TEN PER CENT OF MY BUSINESS RESTORE LIMITED 
RESTORE WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO WHILST I WAS DESIGNING CARS IN COLOGNE GERMANY 
THE INTENTION WAS TO RETURN TO THE U. K. AND EDUCATE THE BRITISH PUBLIC 
AND SHOW THEM THAT ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCTS NEEDN'T BE A COMPROMISE 
IN TERMS OF STYLE QUALITY AND DESIRABILITY 
SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO I'VE DESIGNED A RANGE OF EIGHTEEN PRODUCTS NOW ON THE WEBSITE 
THREE OF WHICH YOU SEE HERE TODAY ANNIE THE SHOPPING TROLLEY CHAIR 
SYLVANA THE WASHING MACHINE DRUM TABLE AND GORDON THE WHEELBARROW CHAIR 
OUR LATEST PRODUCT IS BEN THE BIN HE IS A STACKABLE PORTABLE 
RECYCLING BIN FOR THE HOUSEHOLD THAT USES STANDARD SUPERMARKET CARRIER BAG 
AS WITH ALL THE PRODUCTS I NEEDED TO GAUGE SOME FEEDBACK FROM THE PUBLIC SO WE TOOK BEN THE BIN 
TO GRAND DESIGNS EXHIBITION LAST YEAR AND THE RESPONSE WAS EXCELLENT 
WE TOOK SEVERAL ORDERS FROM PRIVATE CUSTOMERS 
AND SOME SHOPS WERE INTERESTED AND PLACED PROVISIONAL ORDERS 
AND THEN A COUNCILLOR CAME ALONG AND SUGGESTED HE'D LIKE A PRICE FOR FIVE HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND AND TEN THOUSAND UNITS FOR THE BIN 
SINCE THEN ANOTHER FIVE COUNCILS ARE VERY VERY INTERESTED 
AND ARE AT LEAST TRIALLING AND ROLLING OUT TO ALL OF THEIR RESIDENTS 
TO SUMMARISE RESTORE IS GOING FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH 
AND I'VE SEEN SUCH A CHANGE IN CONSUMER ATTITUDES IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
NOW SELLING THESE PIECES TO SAATCHI AND SAATCHI SELFRIDGES 
TOP SHOP ECOVER ALL THE BIG NAMES ARE NOW INTERESTED 
THE INDUSTRY IS THERE PEOPLE ARE READY TO TAKE THESE ON AS A PRODUCT AND SALES ARE THERE TO BE MADE 
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING I HOPE YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF QUESTIONS 
GREEN DESIGNER MAX MCMURDO IS OFFERING A TEN PER CENT STAKE IN HIS RESTORE BUSINESS 
IN RETURN FOR THE FIFTY THOUSAND INVESTMENTS HE NEEDS 
TO LAUNCH HIS LATEST ECO PRODUCT BEN THE RECYCLING BIN 
DEBORAH MEADEN WANTS TO KNOW IF MAX HAS SOLD ANY BENS YET 
MAX YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT'S RIGHT YEAH 
HAVE YOU GOT AN ORDER FROM THEM OR ARE YOU JUST TALKING TO THEM 
WE'VE GOT THREE LETTERS OF INTENT FOR HOW MANY ITEMS 
I'VE GOT TWO FOR FIVE HUNDRED WHICH WILL BE THE TRIAL 
ONCE YOU'VE GOT A TRIAL FROM ONE COUNCIL YOU CAN ROLL ON TO ALL THE NEIGHBOURING COUNCILS 
AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH THEM PARTICULARLY WITH HIGH DENSITY HOUSING AND MULTI OCCUPANCY FLATS 
THERE'S NO CURRENT SYSTEM TO GET YOUR EMPTY MILK BOTTLE DOWN INTO THE BIG COMMUNAL BIN 
SO THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM AS A FREEBIE LIKE YOU GET A COMPOSTING BIN AND YOUR WHEELIE BIN 
THIS WILL BE THE NEXT VERSION OF BIN TO BE ROLLED OUT 
ARE THEY MADE OF RECYCLING THESE ARE ACTUALLY THE PROTOTYPES 
THESE ARE THE ONES THAT WE PRODUCE FROM A SHEET OF POLYPROPYLENE 
THE ACTUAL UNITS WE CAN GET FOR ONE POINT FIVE OH ARE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT RECYCLED BUT DUE TO THAT THEY'RE BLACK 
MAX SEEMS TO HAVE IMPRESSED DEBORAH WITH HIS ECO CREDENTIALS 
NOW DUNCAN BANNATYNE DECIDES TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT MAX'S FURNITURE AND RECYCLING BIN 
THIS IS JUST A PIECE OF PLASTIC YEAH 
AND YOU'RE GONNA SELL IT FOR HOW MUCH FOR ONE POINT FIVE OH 
NOBODY WILL NOTICE IT'S JUST A PIECE OF PLASTIC IS THAT YOUR IDEA 
I'M SURE THEY WILL AS I SAID 
JUST AS THE SHOPPING TROLLEY CHAIR IS JUST AN OLD SHOPPING TROLLEY 
I'M A BIT WORRIED COS IF I STARTED PUTTING THINGS IN THERE 
IT JUST WORRIES ME THE CARRIER BAGS WOULD JUST COLLAPSE 
THE ITEMS YOU TEND TO RECYCLE ARE EMPTY MILK BOTTLES EGG CARTONS PAPER 
THEY DON'T TEND TO BE BREEZE BLOCKS OR WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY MONEY O. I. 
IT'S O. K. 
YOU'VE JUST THROWN MY MONEY AWAY 
THE INTENTION IS YOU'D CARRY THAT DOWN BECAUSE ITS PORTABLE TO YOUR RECYCLING BIN 
AND DISPOSE OF IT AND SEPARATE YOUR WASTE ACCORDINGLY 
THE YOUNG DESIGNER HAS PROVED THAT BEN THE BIN IS STURDY ENOUGH FOR MOST JOBS 
BUT PETER JONES THINKS HE'S SPOTTED A FLAW IN MAX'S PITCH 
MAX I'VE GOT A BIGGER ISSUE WITH ALL OF THIS RIGHT 
THAT IS THAT YOU'RE SELLING THE CONCEPT THAT THIS IS 
NOT JUST FROM A RECYCLING PERSPECTIVE VERY GOOD BUT YOU'RE SELLING THIS AS AN ECO PRODUCT 
BUT YOU ARE NOT AN ECO PRODUCT BECAUSE YOU'RE PUTTING IN THAT PRODUCT 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW THE PLASTIC CARRIER BAG 
EIGHT BILLION A YEAR ARE PRODUCED YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM 
YOU CAN'T RECYCLE THEM AT ALL IT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM YET YOUR PRODUCT 
NEEDS A PRODUCT THAT IS NOT ECO FRIENDLY TO GO IN IT 
WE WOULDN'T PRODUCE OUR OWN CARRIER BAG 
I HAVE THE SAME ISSUE AS PETER HAS GOT WITH CARRIER BAGS 
I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE OUTLAWED TOTALLY 
WE SHOULDN'T FIND USES FOR THEM 
WHEN WE GO TO SUPERMARKETS WE SHOULD BE USING REUSABLE BAGS 
CARRIER BAGS WILL BE WITH US FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS 
RATHER THAN JUST MOANING ABOUT IT SHOULD WE ACTUALLY CREATE A PRODUCT 
THAT CAN RE USE THEM SO IT IS BENEFICIAL TO THE ENVIRONMENT 
IF WE CAN GET THREE USES OUT OF A CARRIER BAG RATHER THAN ONE THAT'S THREE TIMES BETTER 
MAX IS REFUSING TO BE INTIMIDATED BY THE DRAGONS' INTERROGATION 
NOW DEBORAH MEADEN WANTS TO MOVE THE DISCUSSION ON FROM PLASTIC TO CASH 
WHAT'S YOUR TURNOVER HOW MUCH HAVE YOU ACTUALLY SOLD 
IN THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS SINCE GOING FULL TIME 
IN THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS IT'S EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WHICH IS RIDICULOUSLY LOW I APPRECIATE 
WHY IS IT LOW 
THE VOLUME IS LIMITED 
IT IS BESPOKE ONE OFF PIECES 
SAATCHI AND SAATCHI ORDERED FOUR WHICH IS QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL ORDER BUT IT IS STILL JUST OVER ONE THOUSAND 
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU'VE ACCEPTED THAT REALLY ISN'T THE BUSINESS 
THAT ISN'T GONNA GENERATE THE MONEY IT'S ALL DOWN TO THESE BINS 
DEBORAH MEADEN HAS DISCOVERED THAT MAX IS STRUGGLING TO MAKE ANY REALISTIC RETURN 
ON HIS ESTABLISHED FURNITURE RANGE WHICH DOESN'T BODE WELL FOR HIS LATEST PROTOTYPE 
MAX IS BEGINNING TO LOSE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE DRAGONS 
HI MAX I'M JAMES 
LET ME TELL YOU WHERE I AM I LOVE THE TIE 
I CAN'T GET MY HEAD ROUND THE BIN 
I THINK THE COUNCIL CONCEPT OF BLACK BINS AT ONE POINT FIVE OH I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH VOLUME YOU'D SELL 
I JUST DON'T SEE THE NUMBERS WORKING 
MY FIFTY THOUSAND MY RETURN ISN'T GONNA BE IN MY LIFETIME 
I THINK FOR THAT REASON I'M OUT 
O. K. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME 
MAX I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I AM ON THIS 
THIS IS JUST NOT A BUSINESS 
THIS ISN'T A BUSINESS THAT'S GONNA MAKE ANY MONEY OR GIVE ANY RETURN TO ANY INVESTOR IT JUST ISN'T 
SO WE CAN HAVE A BIT OF FUN WITH IT BUT I'M NOT GONNA INVEST SO I'M OUT O. K. THANK YOU 
MAX I THINK I SAID EXACTLY HOW I FELT ABOUT IT 
THE FACT YOU'VE GOT THIS PLASTIC CARRIER BAG 
NECESSARY FOR YOUR PRODUCT IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH FOR ME TO PUT MY MONEY ON THE LINE 
SO FOR THAT REASON I'M OUT 
IT'S A DISASTROUS SETBACK FOR MAX 
HE'S LOST THREE DRAGONS IN AS MANY MINUTES 
HAS DEBORAH MEADEN MADE HER MIND UP TOO 
I THINK I WAS THROWN BY THOSE 
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU BROUGHT THOSE IN TODAY 
I THINK ALL THEY DO IS DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT IS NOT A BUSINESS 
IT DEMONSTRATES YOUR CREATIVITY IT SHOWS I DESIGN SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS 
IT DOES THE SHOPPING TROLLEY CHAIR 
IS ABOUT TO GO IN TO AN EXHIBITION NEXT TO DAMIEN HIRST'S AND TRACEY EMIN'S WORK 
MAX THAT IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT BUT WE ARE HERE LOOKING AT BUSINESS 
THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY HERE 
FOR ME SITS IN THOSE BINS 
SOMETHING IS STOPPING ME FROM SAYING I'M OUT BECAUSE ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S VERY 
I LIKE THE DESIGN IT'S VERY SIMPLE 
IT'S ICONIC IT'S CLASSIC CLEAN SIMPLE DESIGN YOU WOULDN'T MIND HAVING IN YOUR KITCHEN 
EXACTLY I LIKE THE PRACTICALITY OF IT YOU CAN PICK IT UP 
WE'VE GOT PLASTIC BAGS WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT THEY DO EXIST I UNDERSTAND ALL OF THAT 
SO SOMETHING IS STOPPING ME FROM GOING OUT 
LET ME TELL YOU WHERE I AM 
YOU'RE CREATING CHAIRS OUT OF SHOPPING TROLLEYS AND WHEELBARROWS 
IT'S GOOD ISN'T IT YOU'RE NUTS 
YOU'RE TOTALLY BARKING MAD 
THIS IS NOT A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY AS WE EXPECT TO SEE IN THE DEN 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT 
I LOVE IT 
BLIMEY 
I LOVE THE DESIGN 
I DO LIKE THE CHAIRS 
I THINK THE BIN 
IS A BIT OF AN OUTSIDE CHANCE I LIKE YOU 
THANK YOU AM I GONNA MAKE MONEY OUT OF IT 
THAT'S THE QUESTION I'VE BEEN THINKING 
AND I DON'T KNOW 
THIS IS WHAT I'M GONNA DO 
I'LL GIVE YOU FIFTY THOUSAND 
BUT ACTUALLY I WANT THIRTY PER CENT 
JUST IN CASE IN MY MIND 
I MIGHT HAVE JUST PUT FIFTY THOUSAND TO NURTURE AN ARTIST 
ALTERNATIVELY I MIGHT HAVE PUT FIFTY THOUSAND AND POSSIBLY THE BEST INVESTMENT I'VE EVER MADE 
SO I'M BALANCING THE RISK WITH THE REWARD 
TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF HIS RIVAL DRAGONS 
THEO PAPHITIS HAS OFFERED THE ENTIRE FIFTY THOUSAND 
BUT FOR THIRTY PER CENT OF THE BUSINESS THREE TIMES MORE THAN MAX IS WILLING TO GIVE AWAY 
NOW ALL EYES TURN TO AN UNUSUALLY UNDECIDED DEBORAH MEADEN 
SO MAX 
THERE'S SOMETHING STOPPING ME FROM GOING OUT WERE MY LAST WORDS TO YOU I THINK 
IT FEELS LIKE A SERIOUS PUNT BUT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEO WOULD FEEL 
I WOULD BE INTERESTED THEO IN DOING THIS IF WE MADE 
NURTURE THIS YOUNG MAN AT TWENTY FIVE GRAND EACH ABSOLUTELY 
WOULD YOU WANT TO BE NURTURED BY DEBORAH AND MYSELF 
ARE YOU BOTH INTERESTED IN THE FURNITURE AS WELL YEAH 
THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY MAX 
MY OFFER IS CERTAINLY BASED NOT JUST ON WHAT WE SEE HERE BUT SOMETHING IN YOU 
SO I WOULD LIKE TO BE INVESTING IN RESTORE AND WHATEVER PRODUCTS YOU BRING OUT 
SO ALL YOUR DESIGNS GO THROUGH THAT COMPANY THAT SOUNDS 
WELL THEO I'D BE VERY HAPPY TO PUT MY MONEY FORWARD ON THAT BASIS 
THIRTY PERCENT OF THE COMPANY DEAL 
I THINK WE'VE GOT A DEAL WE'VE GOT A DEAL BLIMEY 
WELL DONE WELL DONE 
MAX HAS DONE IT IN A DRAMATIC REVERSAL OF FORTUNE 
HE IS LEAVING THE DEN WITH TWO NEW BUSINESS PARTNERS DEBORAH MEADEN AND THEO PAPHITIS AND THE FIFTY THOUSAND 
CASH INJECTION HE NEEDS IN HIS ECO FRIENDLY RECYCLING COMPANY 
THE DRAGONS RECEIVE NO PRIOR INFORMATION ABOUT ANY OF THE ENTREPRENEURS 
OR INVENTIONS THAT ARE ABOUT TO APPEAR BEFORE THEM IN THE DEN SO THEY HAVE TO THINK ON THEIR FEET 
HELEN JONES AND SANDRA HOPKINS FROM LEICESTER 
WERE LOOKING FOR AN INVESTMENT IN THEIR NEW ACCESSORIES 
DESIGNED TO SOLVE AN AGE OLD PROBLEM FOR FASHION CONSCIOUS WOMEN 
WE COULD IMAGINE WE'RE IN A BUSY NIGHT CLUB AND SANDRA'S STANDING HERE IN HER BEAUTIFUL KILLER HEELS 
I WEAR THEM EVEN THOUGH I KNOW TOWARDS THE END OF THE EVENING 
I'LL BE SUFFERING CRIPPLING PAIN AND POSSIBLY WON'T BE ABLE TO WALK ANOTHER STEP WHILST WEARING THEM 
THEIR SOLUTION A PAIR OF COMFY SLIP ONS CONCEALED IN A HANDY PURSE 
WHICH THEN TRANSFORMS INTO A BAG FOR THOSE KILLER HEELS 
SO YOU CAN PUT THEM IN THERE WHAT'S THE BRAND NAME 
TIPSY FEET TIPSY FEET 
THE DRAGONS INITIALLY WARMED TO TIPSY FEET 
IT'S A NICE IDEA I THINK IT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA 
I LOVE THE IDEA I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC 
BUT THE PITCH TOTTERED AND THEN FELL UNDER SCRUTINY 
THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME IS JUST SIMPLY THE FACT IT'S SO EASY TO REPLICATE 
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY SPEND SIXTY THOUSAND I WOULDN'T GET IT BACK 
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE 
WE HAVE APPLIED FOR A PATENT 
I'M SURE YOUR PATENT WILL TURN UP AND SAY GIMME LOADS OF MONEY NEXT YEAR WE'LL BE MILLIONAIRES 
YES YEAH I'VE HEARD IT BEFORE 
THE DUO DID HOWEVER MANAGE TO WALK AWAY WITH SOME SOUND ADVICE 
PUT A MINIMUM ORDER IN PUT IT IN YOUR BACK BEDROOM 
GET THE WEBSITE GOING AND WHO KNOWS THIS TIME NEXT YEAR 
YOU COULD BE MILLIONAIRES THANK YOU 
AS THE DRAGONS ARE INVESTING THEIR OWN MONEY IN THE DEN 
DON'T BE SURPRISED IF THE QUESTIONS ARE TOUGH 
SO HOW WILL OUR NEXT ENTREPRENEUR STAND UP TO THE PRESSURE 
HELLO MY NAME IS DENISE CHANNING I OWN GOBLIN FILMS LIMITED 
I'VE COME HERE TODAY TO OFFER FIFTEEN PER CENT OF MY COMPANY IN EXCHANGE FOR 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND INVESTMENT IN MY FIRST PROJECT DANCE OF THE GOBLINS 
DANCE OF THE GOBLINS IS A FANTASY FILM BASED ON THE BOOK BY THE SAME NAME BY JACK D. HAWKINS 
THIS IS MY PEN NAME I OWN THE RIGHTS TO THE BOOK THE SCRIPT EVERYTHING 
THE STORY IS SET IN THE FUTURE AFTER A PLANETARY POLE SHIFT 
HAS DEVASTATED THE POPULATION OF THE PLANET 
THE DESCENDANTS OF SURVIVORS HAVE BUILT AN ALMOST MEDIEVAL SOCIETY ON THE RUBBLE OF WHAT WAS ONCE LONDON 
THEY ARE LED BY THE MAGICIAN COUNT ANTON WHO IS THE ONLY HUMAN WHO IS FRIENDS WITH THE GOBLINS 
AS I WAS WRITING THE STORY IT WAS COMING AT ME IN SCENES SO THEN I KNEW IT HAD TO BE A FILM 
SO WHEN I'D FINISHED THE BOOK I TRIED MY HAND AT SCREENWRITING 
AND THAT CAME TO ME QUITE NATURALLY THEN I STARTED LOOKING INTO THE FILM INDUSTRY TO SEE WHO TO SELL IT TO 
ONE THING I LEARNED IS THAT WHAT A PRODUCER DOES IS EFFECTIVELY 
ADMIN AND ORGANISING TWO THINGS I'M VERY GOOD AT 
SO I DECIDED TO DO IT MYSELF 
THINGS JUST FELL INTO PLACE SO THAT NOW I HAVE A FULLY EQUIPPED 
EXPERIENCED CREW A PROFESSIONAL MAKE UP AND PROSTHETICS TEAM 
AND A WELL KNOWN ACTOR ATTACHED TO THE SCRIPT 
I CAN DO ALL THIS ON IN FILM TERMS A VERY LOW BUDGET PARTLY BECAUSE OF GOOD PLANNING 
MY BUDGET SHEET REFLECTS THE ACTUAL COST OF EVERYTHING I NEED TO MAKE THIS FILM 
THE STORY ITSELF IS NATURALLY GIVEN TO BEING SHOT LIKE A DRAMA 
IT DOESN'T NEED A LOT OF SPECIAL EFFECTS 
THIS HAS ACTUALLY BECOME MY COMPANY POLICY THAT ALL MY FILMS 
WILL BE FOCUSED ON A GOOD STORY AND GOOD ACTING RATHER THAN EXCESSIVE EXPENSIVE EFFECTS 
THE GOBLIN CIRCLE HAS A GOOD BALANCE OF DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS AND TALENTED AMATEURS ALL OF WHOM 
ARE DEVOTED TO SEEING THIS PROJECT DONE WHAT EVER IT TAKES 
THIS ISN'T JUST MY DREAM ANY MORE 
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR TODAY BEYOND FINANCIAL INVESTMENT 
IS SOMEONE WHO COULD ENJOY HELPING US CREATE THE MAGIC THAT WILL BRING MY GOBLIN WORLD TO LIFE 
I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE QUESTIONS PLEASE FIRE AWAY 
NORWICH BASED AUTHOR DENISE CHANNING WANTS ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO MAKE HER FEATURE FILM 
DANCE OF THE GOBLINS 
THE DRAGONS KNOW THAT BACKING FILMS CAN BE TAX EFFICIENT FOR WEALTHY ENTREPRENEURS 
BUT WILL THAT SWAY THEM INTO HELPING DENISE TURN HER FANTASY INTO REALITY 
HELLO DENISE HELLO 
I'M DEBORAH 
BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE FILM YOU'VE GOT A BOOK THAT'S ALREADY OUT THERE 
HAS THIS BEEN PUBLISHED AND IS IT ACTUALLY SELLING 
IT IS PUBLISHED IT WAS PUBLISHED MAY FIRST TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
IT HAS HAD LIMITED DISTRIBUTION BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL PUBLISHER 
BUT IT IS IN SOME OF THE MAJOR BOOKSTORES ESPECIALLY HERE IN LONDON HOW MANY HAVE SOLD 
THE FIRST ONE WAS TWO THOUSAND THOSE WERE EITHER SOLD OR PLACED IN BOOKSTORES 
I'M NOT SURE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET NUMBERS FROM MY PUBLISHER 
O. K. WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR HERE IS A REASON WHY WE THINK THE FILM 
MIGHT WORK AND I'M NOT GONNA FIND 
NOT IN THE BOOK SALES NO O. K. SO WHAT MAKES YOU THINK IT'LL WORK 
I CAN GET GOOD PRODUCTION QUALITY WITH THE TEAM THAT I HAVE 
MY DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY HAS EIGHTEEN YEARS' EXPERIENCE IN THE BUSINESS WHAT'S HE DONE BEFORE 
WHAT WOULD I RECOGNISE 
YOU WOULDN'T RECOGNISE WHAT HE DOES BECAUSE HE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT FEATURES HE'S DONE HE HASN'T TOLD ME THAT 
HOW DO I KNOW IF HE'S GOOD OR NOT HE HAS EIGHTEEN YEARS' EXPERIENCE IN THE BUSINESS 
HE'D HAVE BOMBED OUT IF HE HADN'T BEEN PUTTING OUT GOOD PRODUCTS 
IT'S NOT OFTEN THE DRAGONS ARE FLOORED BY A RESPONSE 
DENISE SEEMS OBLIVIOUS TO THEIR CONCERNS 
NOW DUNCAN BANNATYNE WHO'S HAD HIS OWN BOOK PUBLISHED 
WANTS TO INTERROGATE HER MORE ON THE ORIGINAL PUBLICATION 
DENISE YOU WROTE THIS BOOK YES 
AND SOMEONE PUBLISHED IT IN MAY TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
AND IT SOLD LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND COPIES 
YES THE DISTRIBUTION HASN'T BEEN GOOD 
I'D SAY THAT WAS AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER 
WOULDN'T YOU AS BOOK SALES GO YES 
AS BOOK SALES GO THE FILM IS A SEPARATE ENTITY 
WHY IS THE BOOK SUCH A DISASTER IT'S A NEW PUBLISHER WHO DOESN'T HAVE THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS 
WHAT'S THE PUBLISHER'S NAME HE HAS TWO BOOKS ON HIS CATALOGUE YOURS 
SORRY HE HAS TWO BOOKS ON HIS CATALOGUE YOURS AND ONE OF HIS YES HIS OWN 
SO HOW MANY OF HIS BOOKS HAS HE SOLD 
THAT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE HIS FIGURES 
HOW DO WE KNOW THE REASON THE BOOK HASN'T SOLD IS BECAUSE IT'S RUBBISH DID YOU GET ANY REVIEWS 
IT'S BEEN BOOK OF THE MONTH ON THREE OF THE FANTASY YAHOO GROUPS 
FANTASY YAHOO GROUPS YES PEOPLE INTERESTED IN FANTASY FICTION 
JOIN THESE YAHOO GROUPS ON THE INTERNET AND DISCUSS VARIOUS BOOKS 
MINE WAS BOOK OF THE MONTH ON THREE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE FED BACK TO ME THAT THEY WHAT THE SEQUEL TO THIS 
DENISE IS FIGHTING BACK IN A BID TO QUASH THE DRAGONS' CONCERNS 
BUT THEO PAPHITIS WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FANTASY WRITER 
IS WORKING IN THE REAL WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO HER FINANCIALS 
YOU TALKED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET FOR THE FILM 
THE TOTAL BUDGET IS SITTING AT FIFTEEN MILLION RIGHT NOW 
YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME HOW THAT RELATES TO ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE 
WELL ONE MILLION OF THAT IS ASSOCIATE PRODUCER FEE FOR MY ACTOR 
HE IS WORTH IT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE IS 
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO 
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE SOMEBODY ONE MILLION 
THAT'S DEFERRED YES THAT'S DEFERRED 
SOME OF THESE ACTORS MAKE QUITE A FEW MILLION POUNDS 
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN RECENT BLOCKBUSTERS WHO IS THE ACTOR 
I DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO USE HIS NAME WHAT FILMS HAS HE DONE 
PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN THE ONLY BELIEVABLE PIRATE IN THE FILM PHANTOM OF THE OPERA 
TELEVISION FEATURE FILMS BLOCKBUSTERS 
WHO WAS IN PHANTOM OF THE OPERA 
AND PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 
AND HE WAS A REAL PIRATE IF YOU SAY THE NAME I'M GONNA BE IN TROUBLE 
DENISE DO YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT THAT MAKES IT FOR FIVE PEOPLE TO SIT HERE 
AND CONSIDER AN INVESTMENT WHEN THEY'VE GOT NO IDEA 
IT'S A DOUBLE WHAMMY NOT ONLY IS DENISE PLANNING TO GIVE ONE MILLION TO THE LEADING MAN 
SHE'S NOT PREPARED TO REVEAL THE ACTOR'S IDENTITY IN THE DEN 
WE DON'T HAVE TO RESPECT HIS WISHES HE WANTS ONE MILLION 
THE PATIENCE OF THE DRAGONS IS RUNNING OUT 
I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED THAT IF YOUR KEY ACTOR REALLY BELIEVED IN THIS PROJECT 
AND YOU EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT YOU WERE COMING HERE TO RAISE MONEY 
TO MAKE THIS PROJECT A VIABLE SUCCESS 
WHY HE WOULDN'T WANT TO SUPPORT YOU TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE THAT 
THAT'S EASY HE HASN'T HAD HIS ONE MILLION YET CLEARLY 
I THINK THIS IS NOT A CREDIBLE PROJECT 
I'M AMAZED THAT YOU THINK WE CAN GET INSPIRED TO INVEST IN SOMETHING 
WHEN YOUR KEY PERSON DOESN'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO PUT HIS NAME TO A PROJECT WHEN YOU'RE RAISING MONEY 
SO FOR THAT REASON I'M OUT 
DENISE CAN I JUST TELL YOU WHERE I AM 
THIS WHOLE THING HAS BEEN BASED ON THINGS YOU CAN'T SAY 
YOU'RE FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE AND YOU DAMN WELL OUGHT TO BE 
AREN'T YOU I DON'T ACTUALLY FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE 
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE AND YOU OUGHT TO BE 
YOU CANNOT SIT IN FRONT OF FIVE INVESTORS AND NOT TELL THEM MOST OF THE STORY 
YOU'VE LOST CREDIBILITY AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED 
IF YOU THINK I'LL INVEST IN YOU YOU ARE LIVING IN FANTASY LAND 
SO I'M AFRAID YOU CAN HEAR WHERE I'M GOING I'M OUT 
TWO DRAGONS OUT THE CHANCE OF INVESTMENT IS EVAPORATING FAST FOR DENISE AND HER GOBLINS 
DENISE YOU NEED TO GO HOME 
YOU NEED TO GO HOME 
GO TO YOUR BEDROOM TURN OUT THE LIGHT GET UNDER THE QUILT 
AND GET SOME SLEEP 
WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING 
IF YOU REALLY THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA 
MAY I SUGGEST YOU TURN THE LIGHTS BACK OFF AGAIN AND GO BACK TO SLEEP 
THIS IS NOT A GOER 
AND FOR THOSE REASONS I'M OUT 
THIS WHOLE THING'S FICTION I DON'T THINK I'M REALLY HERE 
THIS IS A WHOLE FANTASY 
I'M OUT 
IT'S ALL BUT OVER FOR DENISE 
PETER JONES HAS BEEN UNUSUALLY QUIET UP UNTIL NOW 
IT'S LEFT TO HIM TO HAVE THE FINAL WORD 
WAKE UP PETER 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME IT EVER HAPPENED TO ME I'M SPEECHLESS 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME 
DENISE HAS FAILED TO INSPIRE THE DRAGONS WITH HER GOBLIN MOVIE PROJECT 
AND LEAVES THE DEN EMPTY HANDED 
HE LOVES GOBLINS I'M SPELLBOUND 
HELLO DENISE HELLO QUITE A STRUGGLE 
THEY GOT HUNG UP ON THE ACTOR SO PERHAPS I SHOULDN'T HAVE MENTIONED HIM RIGHT AWAY 
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD THAT I HAD ONE 
IT SEEMED TO TAKE OVER THE CONVERSATION JUST A BIT TOO MUCH 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE A MOVIE BUT THEY NEEDED A STRONG SELLING POINT 
A REASON WHY YOU CAN MAKE A MOVIE 
FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW THERE WASN'T ONE WAS THERE 
I DON'T THINK THEY APPRECIATED THE FACT THAT EVERYONE APART FROM ME 
IS PROFESSIONALS IN THIS BUSINESS THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO EXPLOIT THAT WILL YOU GET IT DONE 
OH YES I DON'T QUIT EVER I'VE DONE TOO MUCH 
I'VE PUT TOGETHER A WHOLE CORPORATION WITH NO MONEY WHATSOEVER 
WE'LL SEE HOW YOU GET ON VERY GOOD LUCK 
YES SEE YOU IN THE AUDIENCE THANK YOU 
ALL THE ENTREPRENEURS THAT ENTER THE DEN THINK THEIR IDEAS COULD MAKE MILLIONS 
ONLY A FEW HEAR THE WORDS THEY DREAM OF 
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER I'D LIKE TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER 
I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER 
MOST HAVE TO DEAL WITH A STRAIGHTFORWARD REJECTION 
I'M OUT I'M OUT I'M OUT 
LIKE SCOTTISH DAIRY FARMER JOHN NAIRN 
HE WANTED ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND INVESTMENT IN MOO VIT HIS NEW RANGE OF FRUIT BASED MILK DRINKS 
THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IS IN A LITTLE BIT OF A DEPRESSION AT THE MOMENT 
I DECIDED I WANTED TO CHANGE THE FORTUNES OF DAIRY FOR MY BUSINESS AND FOR THE FARMING INDUSTRY 
THEREFORE I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF A MILK BASED FRUIT SMOOTHIE 
FAR FROM LAPPING IT UP THE DRAGONS STRUGGLED TO SAVOUR THE TASTE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANYBODY ELSE THINKS BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT NICE 
I'VE GOT TELL YOU I THOUGHT THE SAME THING IT'S BITTER 
I'D RATHER BUY A SMOOTHIE WITHOUT MILK IN IT AND BUY MY MILK SEPARATE AND PUT IT IN MY TEA 
PETER JONES BROUGHT JOHN'S PITCH TO A CLOSE 
I CONGRATULATE YOU FOR THINKING OF SOMETHING NEW 
I COULDN'T MAKE ANY MONEY OUT OF IT I'M OUT 
AND WITH THAT JOHN WAS QUICKLY EXPELLED FROM THE DEN 
ITS NAME IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A LAXATIVE 
MOO VIT AGH 
DEBORAH 
DOMINIC GLESSON OTHERWISE KNOWN AS D. J. SPREADLOVE AND HIS COLLEAGUE JOHN NADDLER 
WERE ASKING THE DRAGONS FOR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO LAUNCH A GLOBAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN 
FOR A D. J. TRAINING BUSINESS TEACH MIX 
TEACH MIX DOES WHAT IT SAYS ON THE COVER IT TEACHES ALMOST ANYBODY 
ABLE TO GET TO A SET OF TURNTABLES OR C. D. PLAYERS HOW TO D. J. OR MIX 
JAMES CAAN WAS EAGER TO TRY AND GET INTO THE GROOVE 
THAT'S IN TIME BUT OUT OF SYNC 
UNLIKE DEBORAH MEADEN WHO SWITCHED OFF EARLY ON 
I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY GOOD O. K. 
FRANKLY THIS READS LIKE HOW TO WORK A KENWOOD MIXER 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE COULD SEE LITTLE POTENTIAL IN THE IDEA 
WHAT'S TO STOP SOMEBODY COPYING IT OR DOING SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR 
NOTHING 
AND JAMES CAAN BEAT A QUICK RETREAT FROM ANY DEAL 
I THINK YOU'RE IN CUCKOO LAND SORRY CUCKOO LAND IT'S A TECHNICAL INVESTOR'S PHRASE 
I JUST DON'T THINK YOU'VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH I'M OUT 
SO FAR TONIGHT THE DRAGONS HAVE BACKED JUST ONE YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR 
WILL ANY OF THESE HOPEFULS PERSUADE THE DRAGONS TO BACK THEM WITH THEIR OWN CASH 
THIS SELLS A BIT IT'S NOT GOING TO SELL A LOT 
YOU ARE NOW WORRYING ME 
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS OFFER YOU FIFTY THOUSAND 
FOR TWENTY PER CENT OF THE EQUITY 
UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES 
FRANCHISING CAN BE ONE OF THE QUICKEST ROUTES TO EXPAND A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS 
LEON HAMLET AND SHAKIL MOUSSA HAVE PLANS TO FRANCHISE THEIR BUSINESS 
BUT THEY NEED THE DRAGONS TO INVEST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
HI MY NAME'S SHAKIL THIS IS MY BUSINESS PARTNER LEON 
WE'RE HERE TO SEEK AN INVESTMENT OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR A FIFTEEN PER CENT SHARE IN OUR COMPANY AQUANAUT LIMITED 
AQUANAUT IS THE FUTURE OF THE CAR WASH AND VALETING INDUSTRY 
WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT OUR BUSINESS IS THAT WE CAN VALET A CAR 
TO A SHOWROOM CONDITION WITHOUT USING WATER 
ADOPTING A ECO FRIENDLY SYSTEM 
AQUANAUT'S WATERLESS PRODUCT WORKS BY CREATING A POSITIVE ELECTRIC CHARGE ON THE DIRT PARTICLES ON THE CAR 
YOU SPRAY ON TO THE SURFACE OF THE CAR 
WIPE WITH RECYCLED TERRY TOWEL 
AND THEN BUFF TO A HIGHLY POLISHED FINISH WITH THE AQUANAUT MICRO FIBRE CLOTH 
BY CLEANING THE CAR THIS WAY 
WE CAN LITERALLY FINISH A CAR IN FIFTEEN MINUTES TO A HIGHLY POLISHED FINISH 
BY NEGATING THE USE OF WATER IT MEANS THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENDLESS 
IN TERMS OF WHERE WE CAN GO WITH THE BUSINESS 
WE ARE NOT RESTRICTED BY ANY HOSEPIPE BANS WATER RESTRICTIONS 
OR ANY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS CONCERNING DRAINAGE SEWAGE ETC 
FROM A COMMERCIAL POINT OF VIEW THE FACT THAT WE DON'T USE WATER 
MEANS WE CAN VALET A CAR ANYWHERE WHETHER IT BE AT THE CUSTOMER'S HOUSE 
PLACE OF WORK WE CAN EVEN BE BASED IN HOTELS CASINOS LEISURE CENTRES THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE TRULY ENDLESS 
WE ENVISAGE TO GROW THE COMPANY VIA A TWO PRONGED ATTACK FIRSTLY FRANCHISING 
WE CURRENTLY HAVE EIGHT MOBILE FRANCHISEES FOUR OPERATIONAL CAR PARKS 
ONE IS IN THE BIGGEST SHOPPING CENTRE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
HOWEVER IN ADDITION TO THE FRANCHISING OPTION WE KNOW THERE IS MASSIVE SCOPE 
WITH REGARDS TO THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE OF THE BUSINESS 
WE THINK IS A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU THE DRAGONS TO INVEST IN SOMETHING THAT'S NEW 
INNOVATIVE SCALABLE AND HOPEFULLY THE FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY 
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING BEFORE WE TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS I'LL GIVE YOU A SAMPLE OF OUR PRODUCTS 
IT'S A POLISHED PITCH BY SHAKIL MOUSSA AND LEON HAMLET 
THEY'RE ASKING THE DRAGONS FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND INVESTMENT 
TO EXPAND THEIR WATERLESS CAR CLEANING FRANCHISE AQUANAUT 
IN RETURN FOR A FIFTEEN PER CENT STAKE OF THE COMPANY 
DEBORAH MEADEN WANTS TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BUSINESS 
WHERE ARE YOU AT THE MOMENT IT SOUNDS A BIT LIKE YOU'RE ALREADY OPERATING AND 
THE BUSINESS IS ALREADY OPERATING WE'VE BEEN OPERATING SINCE APRIL TWO THOUSAND SIX AS A LIMITED COMPANY 
DO YOU OWN THIS PRODUCT 
WE IMPORT THE PRODUCT 
IT'S MADE IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE IMPORT IT 
WE HAVE THE SOLE LICENCE FOR THE U. K. WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR ALL OF EUROPE 
WHAT DOES THE TURNOVER OF THE BUSINESS LOOK LIKE 
IN THE FIRST YEAR I TURNED OVER SIXTY TWO THOUSAND 
WE MADE A NET PROFIT OF THIRTY THOUSAND 
CAN I COME IN HERE SURE 
I WANT TURNOVER FIGURES AND I WANT PROFIT FIGURES FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS 
BASED ON TARGETS NEXT YEAR TWENTY FIVE FRANCHISES FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TURNOVER 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND NET PROFIT 
THE YEAR AFTER WE INTEND TO DO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN TURNOVER 
WITH A NET PROFIT OF JUST OVER ONE MILLION 
AND THE YEAR AFTER TWO MILLION TURNOVER WITH A NET PROFIT OF JUST UNDER FIFTEEN MILLION 
THERE ARE AMBITIOUS GROWTH FORECASTS AND THERE'S OVER AMBITIOUS 
NOW THE DRAGONS WANT TO FIND THEIR WHICH CATEGORY THIS CASE FALLS INTO 
TELL ME EXACTLY HOW THE FRANCHISE WORKS 
THEY PAY A FRANCHISE FEE OF HOW MUCH 
THE SMALLEST FEE STARTS FROM FIVE THOUSAND 
HOW MANY FRANCHISES HAVE YOU SOLD 
WE'VE GOT TWELVE FRANCHISES ALTOGETHER NOW 
WELL IF YOU'VE GOT TWELVE THAT MEANS YOU'VE SOLD MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND WORTH OF FRANCHISES 
INITIALLY WHEN WE STARTED THE BUSINESS WE SOLD THEM AT A SMALLER RATE THAN FIVE THOUSAND 
JUST TO GET PEOPLE OUT THERE GETTING USED TO THE MARKET AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE ENJOYED USING THE PRODUCT 
O. K. 
HI SHAKIL I'M JAMES 
HI JAMES I ACTUALLY HAVE BUILT A FRANCHISE BUSINESS I'M QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS 
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE VALUATION OF ONE MILLION FOR YOUR BUSINESS 
I THINK IT'S BASED ON THE POTENTIAL THAT THE BUSINESS HAS 
IN OUR FIRST TRADING YEAR WE'VE NOT MADE A LOSS 
DOES THAT INCLUDE YOU TAKING A SALARY NO NEITHER OF US TAKE A SALARY SO HOW DO YOU LIVE 
WHEN I INITIALLY STARTED THE BUSINESS 
I SOLD MY CARS MOTORBIKES EVERYTHING I HAD TO FINANCE ME FOR THE FIRST YEAR 
SHAKIL IS IT YOUR FULL TIME JOB 
YEAH BASICALLY THE WAY IT'S HAPPENED IS I ALREADY HAVE A CAR PARK OPERATION 
IT'S A NORMAL WATER BASED TRADITIONAL CAR WASH 
TYPICALLY WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO THE FRANCHISEE THAT HIS INCOME'S GOING TO BE 
A MOBILE FRANCHISEE CAN MAKE BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND AND FORTY THOUSAND A YEAR 
YOU SAID YOU'VE MADE THIRTY THOUSAND AND YOU TAKE NO SALARY 
IF I'M GONNA INVEST MY MONEY INTO YOUR BUSINESS 
I THINK IF THE BUSINESS WOULD BE RUN ON WHAT I CALL A CONVENTIONAL BASIS WHERE YOU TAKE A NORMAL SALARY 
I'D EXPECTED TO TAKE THIRTY FIVE GRAND WHICH MEANS YOU WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THIRTY THOUSAND YOU WILL HAVE LOST THIRTY THOUSAND 
THE GAP AND THE JOURNEY BETWEEN A LOSS OF THIRTY AND ONE MILLION IS JUST TOO BIG 
ON THAT BASIS I'M OUT 
THANK YOU THANKS 
WITH HIS EXPERT KNOWLEDGE OF FRANCHISING 
JAMES CAAN HAS DISMISSED SHAKIL AND LEON'S FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS AND WITHDRAWN 
PETER JONES ISN'T PREPARED TO LET THE MATTER DROP 
I'M JUST LOOKING AT YOUR SLOGAN A SPOTLESS CAR SHOULDN'T COST THE EARTH 
AND UNDERNEATH IT I'M WRITING BUT AN INVESTMENT IN YOUR BUSINESS DOES 
IN WHAT SENSE 
YOU GIVE A GOOD OVERVIEW OF WHERE YOU'RE AT AND YOU'VE GIVEN SOME NUMBERS 
BUT YOU HAVEN'T MADE ANY MONEY 
AND YET YOU VALUE YOURSELVES AT ONE MILLION 
WE'VE ALREADY NEGOTIATED SOME VERY STRONG CONTRACTS 
WITH BIG PEOPLE IN THE CAR PARK SIDE OF THE BUSINESS 
BUT IF YOU DON'T GET THOSE WHAT WOULD YOU VALUE YOUR BUSINESS AT WE'RE CONFIDENT WE'LL GET THOSE 
BUT IF YOU DIDN'T WHAT WOULD YOU VALUE IT AT 
IT WOULD BE THE SAME PROJECTION SIMPLY BECAUSE WE'RE IN A POSITION WHERE 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED DRAINAGE OR ANY FIXTURES AND FITTINGS PEOPLE ARE APPROACHING US 
I CAN'T SEE THE VALUE 
IF YOU CAN SEE WHERE WE'VE COME FROM IN A YEAR 
GUYS AS TWO YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS I THINK YOU'VE DONE BRILLIANTLY 
I'M SURE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO DO BRILLIANTLY I DON'T WANNA PUT YOU DOWN 
I'M SITTING HERE DO I WANT TO INVEST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN A BUSINESS THAT TODAY IS WORTHLESS 
AND THE VALUE THAT YOU'RE PUTTING ON THAT BUSINESS IS ONE MILLION 
IT'LL BE YEARS BEFORE YOUR BUSINESS GENERATES ONE MILLION IN PROFITS ANYWHERE NEAR IT 
AND THAT'S WHY I CAN'T INVEST IN YOU AND THAT'S WHY I'M OUT 
O. K. THANK YOU 
NOTHING INFURIATES THE DRAGONS MORE THAN AN OVERBLOWN COMPANY VALUATION AND TODAY IS NO EXCEPTION 
SO WILL CAR ENTHUSIAST THEO PAPHITIS SEE MORE POTENTIAL IN THE BUSINESS 
ASSUMING THAT I PARTED WITH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF MY KIDS' INHERITANCE 
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH IT 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN TAKE OUR BUSINESS TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE RIGHTS FOR THAT YOU'VE GOT THE U. K. AND IRELAND 
WE'VE GOT THE RIGHTS FOR THE U. K. AND IRELAND 
WE'D LIKE TO MOVE INTO THE AMERICAN MARKET AS WELL WITH THE BLESSING OF THE SUPPLIERS FROM AMERICA 
YOU ARE NOW WORRYING ME 
I CANNOT TAKE ON BOARD THAT THIS IS AN AMERICAN COMPANY MANUFACTURING IN AMERICA 
THEY'VE GIVEN YOU THE U. K. AND IRISH RIGHTS AND IF IT'S THAT GREAT THEY'VE FOUND NOBODY 
IN THE WHOLE OF AMERICA WHO CAN RUN THIS BUSINESS 
AMERICA BY THE WAY IS THE LAND OF FRANCHISE 
THIS IS LIKE TAKING ICE TO THE ESKIMOS 
THEO PAPHITIS IS ASTONISHED TO DISCOVER 
THAT SHAKIL AND LEON PLAN TO FRANCHISE THEIR AMERICAN PRODUCT BACK INTO THE U. S. A. 
DEBORAH MEADEN HAS HEARD ENOUGH 
THEO IS ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON 
WHY ON EARTH WOULD AN AMERICAN ORGANISATION ALLOW YOU THE FRANCHISE IN THE U. K. 
AND THEN TO GO BACK INTO THE STATES 
IF YOU DO WELL IN THE U. K. THEY WILL BE STRAIGHT OUT INTO THE WORLD OF FRANCHISE AND GET THEMSELVES 
SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO IT WHO'S GOT IMMEDIATE CONTACTS 
YOU'VE GOT TO GO THERE YOU'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHERE THE CAR PARKS ARE 
IT'S LEFT ME THINKING I DON'T KNOW THE INDUSTRY VERY WELL 
AND YOU HAVE RAISED SOME BIG QUESTION MARKS FOR ME 
SO I'M AFRAID THAT'S A BAD COMBINATION 
AND ON THAT BASIS I'M OUT 
THREE DRAGONS HAVE WALKED AWAY FROM INVESTING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN AQUANAUT 
IS DUNCAN BANNATYNE ABOUT TO FOLLOW IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS 
I THINK YOU'RE TWO REALLY GOOD ENTREPRENEURS 
BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL COMPANY THAT YOU THINK IT'S GONNA BE 
I THINK YOU WANT TO DO A BIT MORE IN BRITAIN 
WE ARE GETTING FRANCHISE OFFERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD AT THE MOMENT 
THERE'S A GUY FROM CANADA WHO WAS ABOUT TO PAY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CANADIAN DOLLARS 
TO BUY ANOTHER ECO FRIENDLY SYSTEM AND HE'S COME TO SEE US WITH REGARDS TO 
WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T NEED ANY MONEY FROM ANY OF US THEN BECAUSE 
YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE GUYS WHO WANT TO BUY FRANCHISES 
TAKE ALL THEIR MONEY USE THAT MONEY AND EXPAND THE COMPANY GREAT 
BUT THIS IS NOT A BUSINESS FOR ME TO INVEST IN 
SO I'M OUT 
SHAKIL AND LEON'S ONLY HOPE OF INVESTMENT NOW LIES WITH THEO PAPHITIS 
THE GOOD NEWS IS I LIKE BOTH OF YOU 
I LIKE YOUR PRESENTATION YOUR DEMEANOUR AND I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO 
HERE'S THE BAD NEWS 
A LOT OF THE TIME PEOPLE ADOPT FRANCHISE MODELS 
THE REASON THEY ADOPT FRANCHISE MODELS IS VERY SIMPLE IT ALLOWS YOU TO EXPAND VERY QUICKLY 
WITHOUT ANY CAPITAL BECAUSE FRANCHISEES PAY YOU AN UPFRONT SUM 
INSTEAD YOU COME AND ASK FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
WHICH YOU BLATANTLY DO NOT NEED IF YOU ADOPT THE FRANCHISE MODEL OF PEOPLE PAYING YOU MONEY UP FRONT 
I'M DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE YOU'RE THE TYPE OF GUYS I LIKE TO BACK 
AND HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING ELSE YOU TELL ME WOULD HAVE COME TRUE 
SO I TOO NOW AM OUT THANKS THEO 
CHEERS 
IT'S ALL OVER FOR SHAKIL AND LEON 
THE TWO YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS RETURN TO THEIR CAR WASHING BUSINESS WITH NOTHING 
WELL I'M TEMPTED BUT I JUST FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND 
AND TAKE ON BOARD EVERYTHING THAT THEY SAID AS BEING FACTUAL 
BUT IF IT IS THEY DON'T NEED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
FEW ENTREPRENEURS WHO MAKE IT INTO THE DEN MANAGE TO WIN THE DRAGONS OVER AND GET THE CASH THEY'RE AFTER 
AMONG THOSE WHO TRIED AND FAILED INCLUDED VINCE CASTIGLIA FROM HERTFORDSHIRE 
WHO WANTED THE DRAGONS TO INVEST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN HIS BOX TIDY 
DESIGNED TO STOP GROCERIES ROLLING AROUND THE BOOT OF YOUR CAR 
YOU TAKE YOUR SHOPPING AND DROP IT IN LIKE THAT AND IT REALLY IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE WAS TROUBLED BY VINCE'S SALES FORECAST 
THIS IS NOT GOING TO SELL LIKE HOT CAKES 
WHEN THE PRODUCT IS DEMONSTRATED AND WE 
PROVED THIS ON SHOPPING CHANNELS WE'VE SOLD OUT TIME AND TIME AGAIN 
I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WATCH SHOPPING CHANNELS THAT THEY'LL BUY ANYTHING 
I WOULDN'T HAVE THAT IN THE BACK OF MY CAR 
BUT VINCE PUT UP A VALIANT FIGHT 
I'M GOING TO TAKE THE BUSINESS TO ANOTHER LEVEL 
I'M CONCERNED THAT THE LEVEL YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THE BUSINESS 
IS NOT UP HERE THE LEVEL IS GOING TO BE DOWN THERE UNLESS YOU GET SOME GOOD BUSINESS ADVICE 
THE DRAGONS QUICKLY LOST INTEREST AND IT WAS LEFT TO DEBORAH MEADEN TO SEND VINCE PACKING 
THIS SELLS A BIT 
IT'S NOT GOING TO SELL A LOT 
SO I'M OUT THANK YOU DEBORAH 
YOU NEED TO PACK UP YOUR BAG 
NEXT INTO THE DEN WAS GEORGINA BINGHAM FROM YORKSHIRE 
SHE WANTED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF INVESTMENT IN HER RANGE OF NOVELTY CHILDREN'S LIGHT SWITCHES 
I'M AIMING TO ENCOURAGE CHILDREN TO TURN OFF THE LIGHTS 
IT MAKES A SOUND WHEN THE LIGHT IS SWITCHED OFF PLING 
THE FOOTBALL MODEL IS ATTRACTING ATTENTION FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE CLUBS 
DEBORAH MEADEN STRUGGLED TO SEE A FUTURE IN THE BUSINESS 
WHETHER I LIKE IT OR NOT ISN'T THE ISSUE IF YOU CAN SELL IT 
BUT YOU CAN'T WELL I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF COMPANIES 
BASICALLY WHAT THEY WANT IS MORE PRODUCT RANGE AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY I'M HERE 
NO NO IF THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE TELLING YOU THEY'RE GIVING YOU A NICE GENTLE GOODBYE AT THE DOOR 
PETER JONES THOUGHT THE CONCEPT WAS FLAWED 
WHEN YOU WANT TO SETTLE YOUR CHILDREN GET THEM DOWN INTO BED 
AND THAT QUIET TIME TURNS INTO FUN TIME 
MM I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE UP 
AND JAMES CAAN SEARCHED IN VAIN FOR SOME CLARITY FROM THE ENTREPRENEUR 
FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CONVINCE ME WHAT'S THE BIGGEST ORDER YOU'VE HAD SO FAR 
FIFTY UNITS FIFTY UNITS YES THAT SOUNDS REALLY FEEBLE DOESN'T IT 
MY POINT IS IF THAT'S THE BEST YOU'VE DONE YOU NEED TO TURN THE LIGHTS OFF FOR YOURSELF GEORGINA 
JAMIE JENKINSON FROM DUBLIN IS ENTERING THE DEN WITH A PRODUCT 
THAT WAS INSPIRED BY HIS HIS MOTHER'S LOVE OF SUNBATHING 
WILL THE DRAGONS SEE ENOUGH POTENTIAL IN IT TO INVEST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEIR OWN MONEY 
HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JAMIE JENKINSON 
I'M A DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY CALLED CUSH 'N SHADE LIMITED 
WE ARE THE DESIGNERS AND SUPPLIERS OF A UNIQUE NEW SUNBATHING ACCESSORY CALLED CUSH 'N SHADE 
I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR AN INVESTMENT OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
IN RETURN I'M OFFERING FIFTEEN PER CENT EQUITY IN OUR COMPANY 
CUSH 'N SHADE COMBINES FOR THE FIRST TIME A CUSHION AND A SUNSHADE ALL IN ONE LIGHT PORTABLE PRODUCT 
THE CUSHION GIVES THE USER'S HEAD BOTH COMFORT AND SUPPORT WHILE 
SUNBATHING AND THE SHADE PROVIDES FIFTY UPF PROTECTION AGAINST THE AGEING AND DAMAGING EFFECTS OF THE SUN 
THE FRAME USES A RATCHET MECHANISM ALLOWING THE 
USER TO ADJUST THE SUNSHADE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE SUN'S MOVEMENTS 
IT CAN BE USED ON THE BEACH STAND ALONE OR IT CAN ALSO BE ATTACHED TO ANY SUN LOUNGER 
THIS IS THE PACKAGING IT IS SMALL COMPACT VERY PORTABLE 
AND IDEAL FOR MANY RETAIL SALES CHANNELS TO DISPLAY 
THE SUN CARE INDUSTRY IN THE U. S. AND EUROPE WAS WORTH TWO BILLION IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND THIS IS GROWING EVERY YEAR 
ERM 
TO DATE WE HAVE SOLD APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND UNITS OF CUSH 'N SHADE 
SINCE WE STARTED TRADING IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND SIX 
WE ARE CURRENTLY TALKING TO TWO U. S. RETAILERS C. V. S. A LARGE PHARMACEUTICAL CHAIN 
WITH SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED STORES ACROSS AMERICA AND TARGET WITH OVER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STORES ACROSS AMERICA 
AN INVESTMENT TODAY OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND COULD GENERATE AN ACCUMULATED NET PROFIT 
OF JUST UNDER A MILLION POUNDS IN TWO THOUSAND TEN 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS 
A NERVOUS JAMIE JENKINSON FROM DUBLIN IS ASKING THE DRAGONS TO INVEST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN CUSH 'N SHADE 
A CUSHION AND A SUNSHADE ROLLED INTO ONE 
HE IS OFFERING A FIFTEEN PER CENT STAKE OF HIS COMPANY 
JAMIE WILL YOU PUT PETER JONES OUT OF HIS MISERY PLEASE 
MY GOD PETER WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IT DOESN'T HELP IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT THE INSTRUCTIONS 
AH THERE'S THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THERE 
THE DRAGONS ARE CLEARLY INTRIGUED BY THE PRODUCT BUT DEBORAH MEADEN WANTS TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS 
HELLO JAMIE I'M DEBORAH 
HIGH UM HOW MUCH DO THEY SELL FOR THE ORIGINAL UNIT 
RETAILED FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS OR ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY NINE STERLING PLUS DELIVERY 
WHAT ARE THEY COSTING YOU TO PRODUCE 
ER THE LATEST MODEL COSTS THREE POINT FOUR FIVE AT THE MOMENT TO MANUFACTURE 
THAT IS FULLY PACKAGED 
THAT'S EVERYTHING AND THERE IS ROOM FOR GREATER SAVINGS 
WITH THE VOLUME SALES WHEN WE ARE TALKING TO THE BIGGER RETAILERS 
SO WHAT'S YOUR WHOLESALE 
OBVIOUSLY THE RETAIL IS SIXTEEN POINT NINE NINE WHAT'S YOUR WHOLESALE PRICE 
FOUR POINT TWO OH DIRECT FROM CHINA 
RIGHT SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT MAYBE A ONE MARGIN 
YES GIVE OR TAKE 
WHAT HAVE YOU MADE FROM THE SALES THAT YOU'VE GENERATED ER 
OUR GROSS PROFIT TO DATE IS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THOUSAND 
AND WHAT I YOUR COSTS AGAINST THAT THIRTY THOUSAND WELL WE DO HAVE 
AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE TWO DIRECTORS WORKING FULL TIME 
WE DON'T PAY OURSELVES ANY SALARY 
WE HAVEN'T PAID OURSELVES ANYTHING FROM THE START 
SO TRAVEL AND THE NORMAL DAY TO DAY RUNNING ARE OUR MAIN COSTS 
JAMIE HAS FAILED TO IMPRESS THE DRAGONS WITH HIS FINANCIALS 
AND NOW RETAIL MAGNATE THEO PAPHITIS IS ABOUT TO ADD TO HIS WOES 
JAMIE WHAT'S STOPPING ME COMPETING AGAINST YOU 
WELL WE DO HAVE PATENTS GRANTED AND PENDING 
THAT'S GREAT GRANTED AND PENDING BREAK IT DOWN FOR ME 
O. K. THEY'RE GRANTED IN IRELAND AND SOUTH AFRICA AND THEY'RE PENDING IN THE U. S. EUROPE AND HONG KONG 
SO DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT NOBODY IS GONNA KNOCK ONE OF THESE UP CHEAPLY THEMSELVES 
WELL WE WOULD TAKE THEM ON THE MARKETS 
OUR PATENTS ARE IN ALL THE MAJOR MARKETS 
THE REASON I'M SAYING THIS IS BECAUSE I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN 
SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO THIS ALL OVER THE CONTINENT SO IT'S NOT NEW 
SO IF YOU'VE HAD ANYTHING GRANTED IT WILL BE FOR 
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MAKE UP OF THE ACTUAL PRODUCT WHICH MEANS IT IS REALLY EASY TO COPY 
FIRSTLY I DO APPRECIATE YOUR POINT BUT WE DO HAVE OTHER 
VERY INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS IN THE PIPELINE AT THE DESIGN STAGE 
I SEE NOW THE PENNY'S DROPPING WHAT ARE THOSE 
WELL I CAN'T GO INTO MUCH DETAIL BECAUSE 
THEY'RE STILL AT THE DRAWING STAGE BUT THEY ARE VERY INNOVATIVE JUST AS INNOVATIVE AS CUSH 'N SHADE 
JAMIE IS STANDING HIS GROUND UNDER SCRUTINY FROM THE DRAGONS 
BUT IS HE DOING ENOUGH TO SECURE A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INVESTMENT 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE IS READY TO SAY WHERE HE STANDS 
SO JAMIE YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS THAT'S RIGHT 
AND YOU'VE MADE ABOUT 
TWENTY THOUSAND PROFIT OR SOMETHING 
YEAH GIVE OR TAKE HOW ARE YOU FUNDING YOUR LIFESTYLE 
FORTUNATELY I HAD A GOOD WELL PAID JOB PREVIOUSLY 
SO I WAS ABLE TO YOU'RE LIVING FROM THAT YEAH 
I'M JUST ABSOLUTELY AMAZED THAT YOU CAN THINK THIS IS A BUSINESS 
O. K. YOU SEEM AN INTELLIGENT GUY 
IS IT JUST THAT YOU CAN'T ACCEPT YOU'VE WASTED EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF YOUR LIFE IS THAT WHAT IT IS 
JAMIE I'LL HELP YOU I'M OUT 
DUNCAN BANNATYNE HAS LOST PATIENCE WITH JAMIE 
WILL PETER JONES SHARE THE CONCERNS OF HIS RIVAL 
WE GET TO SEE A LOT OF PRODUCTS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND A LOT OF CRAZY ONES 
AND I QUITE LIKE IT 
IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU CAN SEE SELLING 
I'VE JUST COME BACK FROM AMERICA AND I THINK THAT ON THE BEACH IN AMERICA 
PEOPLE WOULD IT'S OUR BIGGEST MARKET 
I CAN JUST SEE PEOPLE BUYING THAT ESPECIALLY IN LOS ANGELES THEY BUY A LOT MORE CRAZY THINGS THERE 
ABSOLUTELY 
AN IMPRESSED PETER JONES APPEARS TO HAVE A VISION FOR THE PRODUCT 
BUT HAS STOPPED JUST SHORT OF MAKING AN OFFER 
HIS RIVAL DRAGONS HAVE BEEN LISTENING INTENTLY AND NOW JAMES CAAN STEPS IN 
JUST TALK ME THROUGH YOUR PROJECTIONS OF WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE 
GOING TO SELL AND WHO YOU'RE GONNA SELL THIS TO 
WELL OBVIOUSLY C. V. S. AND TARGET ARE THE TWO COMPANIES IN THE STATES 
THE TWO MAJOR COMPANIES THAT WE'RE TALKING TO AT THE MOMENT 
I ALSO SEE THIS SELLING OBVIOUSLY THROUGH COMPANIES THAT SELL OUTDOOR 
FURNITURE YOUR BEACH SHOPS THAT SELLS YOUR BEACH ACCESSORIES YOUR MAIL ORDER CATALOGUES 
IT'S SUITABLE FOR ALMOST EVERY SALES CHANNEL 
AND I CAN SEE ALL THOSE THINGS THEY MAKE A LOT OF SENSE 
THE ONLY THING THAT IS HOLDING ME BACK IS SOMETHING'S TELLING ME 
YOU'VE TRIED ALL OF THOSE AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN INTERESTED 
NO WE HAVEN'T TRIED 
I THINK I COULD BE INTERESTED IN MAKING YOU AN OFFER 
AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS OFFER YOU FIFTY THOUSAND 
FOR TWENTY PER CENT OF THE EQUITY 
O. K. 
JAMES CAAN HAS MADE THE FIRST MOVE OFFERING JAMIE HALF THE MONEY FOR TWENTY PER CENT OF HIS BUSINESS 
BUT UNDER DEN RULES JAMIE MUST SECURE ALL THE MONEY HE IS ASKING FOR 
CAN HE CONVINCE ANOTHER DRAGON TO PUT UP THE REMAINDER 
JAMIE YES PETER HI 
I'M NOT SURPRISED BY THE NEW DRAGON TRYING TO JUMP IN 
I DO THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD IDEA 
THANK YOU 
AND I AM GOING TO MATCH JAMES'S OFFER 
OF FIFTY THOUSAND FOR TWENTY PER CENT OF THE BUSINESS 
O. K. THANK YOU FOR YOUR OFFER I'D JUST LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE REST OF THE DRAGONS 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT IT STRAIGHTAWAY NO I WOULD JUST LIKE 
TO HEAR WHAT DEBORAH AND THEO HAVE TO SAY BEFORE 
I'LL GIVE YOU THE OFFER FOR THREE MINUTES 
IN AN ATTEMPT TO SECURE HIS PLACE IN THE DEAL PETER JONES HAS TAKEN 
THE EXTRAORDINARY STEP OF SETTING A THREE MINUTE DEADLINE 
BUT ONE DRAGON IS REFUSING TO PLAY BALL VERY QUICKLY THEO 
HATE TO PUT YOU UNDER A TIME CONSTRAINT BUT I HAVE PETER HERE 
TWO MINUTES ON THE WATCH 
I'M JUST VERY CONSCIOUS OF PETER'S TIME ONE MINUTE THIRTY 
I'M NOT CONSCIOUS OF IT 
DEBORAH 
I LIKE IT I DO THINK THEO HAS GOT A POINT OVER THE COPYING OF IT 
BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU I THINK IT'S GOOD AND I WOULD MATCH THAT OFFER 
O. K. THANK YOU DEBORAH 
DEBORAH MEADEN IS NOW THE THIRD DRAGON TO ENTER THE FRAY 
MATCHING THE EXISTING OFFERS OF JAMES CAAN AND PETER JONES 
THE CLOCK IS TICKING BUT THEO IS STILL REFUSING TO BE INTIMIDATED BY HIS RIVAL 
THEO CAN I GET BACK TO YOU 
JAMIE LET ME JUST HELP YOU 
WHILST IT OBVIOUSLY HAS SOME MERIT AND YOU WILL SELL SOME 
AND YOU WILL SELL SOME AROUND THE WORLD I'M SURE RIGHT 
I'M LOOKING AT IT AS AN INVESTMENT AND I'M LOOKING AT IT ON THE BASIS 
THAT IF I PUT MY MONEY IN WHERE'S THE LONG TERM FUTURE 
AT THE MOMENT I CAN'T SEE THIS BEING A LONG TERM BUSINESS FOR ME SO THAT'S THE REASON I'M OUT 
IT'S DECISION TIME FOR JAMIE 
HE HAS THREE OFFERS ON THE TABLE ALL FOR HALF THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INVESTMENT 
BUT WHICHEVER DRAGON COMBINATION HE CHOOSES HE WILL HAVE TO SACRIFICE FORTY PER CENT OF HIS BUSINESS 
UNLESS HE CAN PERSUADE THEM TO REDUCE THEIR EQUITY DEMANDS 
JUST ON THE TWENTY PER CENT FROM THE THREE OF YOU 
UM THAT'S A LOT MORE EQUITY THEN WE'RE PREPARED TO GIVE AWAY 
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU CAN BRING TO THE COMPANY 
YOUR CONTACTS AND EXPERIENCE ARE INVALUABLE 
IS THERE ANY ROOM FOR NEGOTIATION CAN WE BRING THE EQUITY DOWN TO THIRTY PER CENT FOR INSTANCE 
DEBORAH ARE YOU TIED DOWN TO THAT TWENTY PER CENT FOR FIFTY THOUSAND 
ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S A GOOD OFFER IT'S A. 
GENEROUS OFFER O. K. THANK YOU DEBORAH 
FORTY SECONDS 
IT'S THE MOMENT OF TRUTH 
WITH NONE OF THE DRAGONS WILLING TO BUDGE WHICH TWO WILL JAMIE CHOOSE TO BACK HIM 
JAMES THANK YOU FOR YOUR INITIAL OFFER 
I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR BUSINESSES 
I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH PETER AND DEBORAH AND FOR THAT REASON 
I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT YOUR OFFER DEBORAH AND PETER WELL DONE 
JAMIE'S HAS DONE IT AND PETER JONES'S STRATEGY HAS PAID OFF 
SECURING A STAKE IN CUSH 'N SHADE FOR HIMSELF AND DEBORAH MEADEN 
TO BE HONEST THERE ARE A LOT OF MARKETS FOR THAT 
I THINK YOU'LL DO WELL HE'S A GOOD GUY 
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY SOLD A BUSINESS OR TWO AND YOU'VE GOT TIME ON YOUR HANDS 
JAMIE WELL DONE THANK YOU 
ARE YOU FEELING PLEASED ABOUT IT 
YEAH I AM 
I UNDERSTAND I GAVE AWAY A LOT MORE EQUITY THEN WHEN I CAME IN AT THE START BUT I KNEW 
THAT I WOULD HAVE TO BARGAIN ON THE EQUITY 
I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY CAN BRING TO THE COMPANY AND HAVING TWO DRAGONS INSTEAD OF ONE 
IS PRETTY INVALUABLE TO US 
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BECAUSE AFTER THE FIRST FEW MINUTES IT 
LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING ALL THE WRONG WAY DIDN'T IT 
YEAH IT INITIALLY DID BUT I'M CONFIDENT IN MY PRODUCT 
YES THEY WERE HAVING A LAUGH AND HAVING A JOKE BUT THEY'VE EVERY RIGHT TO 
AT THE END OF THE DAY I DID GET DRAGONS WHO WERE INTERESTED 
O. K. WE'LL SEE HOW YOU GET ON 
THANK YOU WELL DONE THANKS 
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER DAY OF DRAMA IN THE DEN 
ALL COMERS WERE DESPERATE FOR INVESTMENT TO MAKE THEIR BUSINESS DREAMS COME TRUE 
MOST LEFT EMPTY HANDED BUT TWO BUSINESSES LEFT WITH ALL THE 
CASH THEY CAME FOR AND A COUPLE OF INFLUENTIAL NEW SHAREHOLDERS 
YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE DRAGONS 
AND SEE WHAT OUR ENTREPRENEURS FELT ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE BY GOING TO 
GOODBYE 
NEXT TIME ON DRAGONS' DEN ONE ENTREPRENEUR GETS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF DEBORAH MEADEN 
I'M NOT STUPID I CAN DO NUMBERS 
YOU ARE ASKING US TO LOSE MONEY 
AND PETER JONES GETS HOT UNDER THE COLLAR 
WHY 
WHY WHY 
WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT THIS
