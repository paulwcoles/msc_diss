LAND AHOY AND TODAY WE ARE ON COURSE FOR THE ENGLISH RIVIERA 
AND BEAUTIFUL BRIXHAM 
OUR BUYERS WANT TO KNOW WHAT LIFE'S LIKE WHEN SALTY SEA WATER HITS YOUR FACE

THEY CAN BE SURE OF ONE THING 
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO TRY BEFORE THEY BUY 
SO MEET OUR BEACH COMBERS CHRIS AND BARBARA WEAVING 
THEY WANT TO SWAP THEIR SUTTON COLDFIELD HOME FOR A LIFE BY THE SEA 
THEY'VE BEEN BITTEN BY THE TRAVEL BUG 
THEY WANT A SEASIDE BASE THAT GIVES THEM AND THEIR MOTOR HOME EASY ACCESS TO FOREIGN SHORES 
NOW BARBARA IS A KEEN WATERCOLOUR ARTIST 
SO INSPIRATIONAL LANDSCAPES AND NICE LIGHT ARE A MUST 
AND CHRIS IS A TRAIN BUFF 
AND LOVES NOTHING BETTER THAN TINKERING WITH HIS TRAIN SET IN THE GARDEN SHED 
SO THIS SEEMS LIKE THE SIMPLEST PROGRAMME WE HAVE EVER HAD TO DO 
YOU'RE HERE WE'RE IN BRIXHAM 
WE'RE STOOD NEXT TO A MOBILE HOME ISN'T THAT THE JOB DONE 
WE MOVE THIS WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO 
NO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DRAUGHTY FOR THE WINTER 
SO WE WANT BRICKS AND MORTAR 
WE WANT TO TRAVEL ROUND IN THAT IN THE SUMMER 
SO YOU KNOW WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS GOT A BIT OF ROOM 
ON THE SIDE THAT WE CAN PUT THE MOTOR HOME 
AND A NICE COMFORTABLE LITTLE HOUSE SOMEWHERE 
I AM FROM THIS AREA SO I LOVE IT 
BUT WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED THAT THIS IS THE PLACE THAT YOU WANT TO END UP IN 
WE VISIT DOWN HERE QUITE OFTEN 
WELL YES WE VISIT DOWN HERE LOTS TWO OR THREE TIMES A YEAR GENERALLY 
I'VE GOT BROTHERS LIVING IN THE AREA 
WE LIKE THE SEA IN GENERAL SO JUST TO BE BY THE SEASIDE 
AFTER LIVING IN THE MIDLANDS FOR ALL OUR LIVES REALLY 
IT'LL JUST MAKE A NICE CHANGE 
WHAT WILL YOU DO DOWN HERE THOUGH IS IT ALL JUST ABOUT RELAXING 
WELL I PAINT SO IT WILL BE MARVELLOUS FOR ME 
TO GO SOMEWHERE A BIT DIFFERENT I'VE DONE THE COUNTRYSIDE VIEWS 
I'D LIKE TO DO SOME SEASCAPES AND THINGS LIKE THAT NOW 
CHRIS DOES MODEL ENGINEERING SO HE IS MAKING THREE B. ONE ENGINES 
I'M CURRENTLY WITH A COLLEAGUE 
MAKING THREE SEVEN AND A QUARTER INCH GAUGE LOCOMOTIVES 
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THEM FOR FIVE YEARS 
AND WE HAVE ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR YEARS LEFT 
CHRIS THAT MEANS NOTHING TO ME THAT MEANS NOTHING 
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN TALKING GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT THEN 
THREE SOMETHING OR OTHER THREE O. K. THREE MODEL ENGINES 
WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT THIS 
HE'S USUALLY DOWN THE SHED 
THERE'S ANOTHER THING WE NEED EITHER A SHED 
OR A REASONABLE WORKSHOP OR WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE OVER HALF A GARAGE 
IF THERE IS A GARAGE AT THE PROPERTY THAT WE MANAGE TO FIND 
I KNOW IF HE IS DOWN THE SHED HE'S WORKING 
HE'S NOT SITTING THERE WITH A NEWSPAPER 
A LOT OF MEN IN SHEDS AREN'T ALWAYS WORKING 
WE'LL FIND THIS HOUSE FOR YOU WHAT IS THE BUDGET 
HOW MUCH WILL WE SPEND 
WE WOULD THINK HOPEFULLY AROUND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
BUT GO ON GO ON WE COULD MAYBE GO TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM 
YES I THINK SO YES WE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE THAT MAX 
O. K. THAT SOUNDS FAIR WE WANT MONEY TO SPEND ABROAD IN ITALY AND FRANCE 
WE WANT TO SPEND THE KIDS' INHERITANCE ABROAD 
GOOD I LIKE A COUPLE OF INHERITANCE BLOWERS 
WE'LL WASTE NO TIME HAVE A CREAM TEA AND WE WILL SEE YOU LATER ON 
WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF INHERITANCE BLOWERS ON OUR HAND 
IT'S THE OLD ONES YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH OUT FOR 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THEM ARE THE HOUSES THAT WE'VE GOT TO FIND 
IT'S GOT TO HAVE SPACE SO THEY CAN BUILD STEAM ENGINES 
AND YET VIEWS WHERE YOU CAN PAINT LANDSCAPES 
DO YOU THINK I'D BE GOOD RENDERED IN WATERCOLOUR 
I'D SAY GOUACHE GOUACHE OH REALLY 
NOT GOULASH GOUACHE GOUACHE YES 
IF I COVERED YOU IN GOULASH THAT WOULD LOOK LOVELY 
JUST CALL ME STEW LET'S GO FIND A HOUSE RIGHT 
BUYING A SLICE OF THE ENGLISH RIVIERA MIGHT BE CHEAPER THAN YOU THINK 
BRIXHAM IS AROUND THE BAY FROM TORQUAY 
AND YOU COULD GET A PLACE OF YOUR OWN IN THIS HISTORIC FISHING TOWN 
FROM AROUND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
AND BRIXHAM OFFERS EVERY SEASIDE ATTRACTION IMAGINABLE 
FROM BEAUTIFUL BEACHES TO A BUSTLING HARBOUR 
PICTURESQUE FISHERMEN'S COTTAGES AND OF COURSE 
PLENTY OF FISH AND CHIPS 
BUT WHAT WOULD A BUDGET OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND BUY YOU AROUND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
THIS SMART THREE BEDROOM HOUSE IN GIBDON HAMPSHIRE 
OFFERS A VERY COMFORTABLE VILLAGE LIFESTYLE 
AND PLENTY OF SPACE FOR A CARAVAN AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
NOW ED HOW ABOUT DOVE COTTAGE IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE 
IT'S GOT LOADS OF CHARMING RUSTIC FEATURES 
AND COULD BE YOURS FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
WHICH I THINK MAKES IT A VERY INTERESTING PROPOSITION 
OR SET SAIL TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT 
TO THIS BEAUTIFULLY REFURBISHED COTTAGE ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
THIS THREE BEDROOM SEMI DETACHED HAS BEEN SYMPATHETICALLY MODERNISED 
AND RETAINS ITS PERIOD CHARACTER 
LOOK AT THAT WE ARE HERE BANG 
WILLIAM OF ORANGE LANDED THERE 
WHICH IS NOW A BIG FISH AND CHIP SHOP 
I BET HE WISHED HE'D TURNED UP LATER 
OVERWHELMINGLY THE BEST PROPERTY YOU HAVE EVERY SHOWN ANYONE 
IF BRIXHAM WAS A FISH WHAT KIND OF FISH WOULD BRIXHAM BE 
IN WHAT WAY BRIXHAM PLAICE 
BRIXHAM PLAICE REALLY GREAT HERE'S YOUR BUS 
I WAS THINKING SOMETHING OLDE WORLDE 
WHAT FISH DO YOU THINK SUMS UP BRIXHAM 
THAT HAS SPACE FOR A WINNEBAGO 
FLAT FISH WHY A FLAT FISH IT'S BORING AND THERE'S NOTHING HERE 
THE INNER HARBOUR AREA WASN'T REALLY DESIGNED FOR THE AUTOMOBILE NO 
HAS IT BECOME A DIFFERENT FISH OVER THE YEARS YEAH 
WAS IT EVER A KILLER WHALE YES AT ONE TIME 
THE VICTORIANS DIDN'T HAVE MANY WINNEBAGOS AT ALL NOT ON THE WHOLE 
THEY WERE SO SHORT SIGHTED WHAT WERE THEY THINKING 
SOLE REALLY WHY 
BECAUSE IT IS QUITE A SOULFUL PLACE 
VERY NICE I SEE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE THERE SOULFUL PLACE I KNOW HA HA 
THE DRIVE IS MASSIVE 
I CHALLENGE YOU TO FIND A WINNEBAGO THAT WON'T GO ON THAT 
YOU'RE THROWING DOWN THE GAUNTLET AREN'T YOU 
NOW IN BRIXHAM IT'S VERY EASY TO CATCH FISH 
HOWEVER TRAWLING FOR PROPERTIES WELL THAT'S NOT QUITE SO EASY 
BUT I THINK LOOKING AT OUR CATCH HERE WE'VE DONE ALL RIGHT 
WE'VE CAST OUR NET LOOK AT THE PROPERTY DETAILS WE'VE GOT 
AND WE ONLY NEED TO FIND THREE 
OH BOY YES INDEED I AM QUITE PLEASED WITH MY PROPERTY 
IT IS LARGER THAN REQUIRED FOUR BEDROOMS EDWARD 
THEY ONLY WANTED THREE DON'T BE COCKY 
FOUR BEDROOMS ANYTHING ELSE YOU'VE GIVEN THEM EXTRA 
WELL THE VIEWS ARE NICE IT'S GOT THE PERIOD DETAIL 
AND THE PRICE IS GOOD WHAT MORE CAN I SAY 
AND PARKING FOR THE MOTOR HOME YES ACTUALLY YES WHAT ABOUT YOU 
YOU'VE SLIGHTLY PUT ME IN THE SHADE THERE 
I THINK MINE'S NICE IT'S A DIFFERENT HOUSE DIFFERENT STYLE 
A LITTLE BIT MORE MODERN 
DOES HAVE A SLIGHT PROBLEM LET'S NOT MENTION IT NOW 
IS THIS YOUR PROPERTY BAIT IS THIS THE BEST YOU CAN DO IT'S GREAT 
FANTASTIC VIEWS LOVELY VIEW OF A CHURCH OUTSIDE 
IT'S GOT A GREAT GARDEN NICE BIT OF DECKING OUT THERE 
IT'S LOVELY AND I THINK IT IS EASILY MOVE IN ABLE 
MOVE IN ABLE THAT TECHNICAL TERM I'M TRYING THAT PHRASE OUT 
THEN FOR THE WILD CARD OUR JOINT CHOICE I FOUND THIS 
I FOUND THIS THE SAME PLACE GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE 
AND IT'S SO MAGICAL EVEN THE ESTATE AGENTS 
WHO ARE NOT KNOWN FOR THEIR ARTISTRY 
HAS PENNED THIS ABOUT THE VIEW 
ALSO IN THE VIEW IS THE BUSTLING FISH QUAY 
AND THE GENTLE SWAYING MAST OF THE YACHT DOWN IN THE MARINA 
IT WILL HAVE UPVC FRAMED DOUBLE GLAZED WINDOWS AND DOORS 
AND ELECTRIC HEATING 
YEAH HE LOST THE POETRY JUST THERE 
SO THERE WE HAVE IT WE'VE GOT OUR THREE PROPERTIES 
LET'S COMMENCE THE VIEWINGS 
AND PROPERTY ONE IS MY CHOICE 
SET UP HIGH ON THE NORTH WEST OF BRIXHAM 
IS THIS SPLENDID TRADITIONAL VICTORIAN TOWN HOUSE 
WHICH I THINK MAY WELL PUT THE WIND IN OUR BUYERS' MAINSAIL 
NOW BARBARA AND CHRIS IGNORE THE CAT IN THE TREE 
HERE WE ARE AT MY CHOICE NOW THIS IS A VERY EXCITING HOUSE 
AND I WANT YOU TO BE EXCITED 
I AM YOU FEELING IT YES WE'RE FEELING IT 
HERE WHAT I'M SHOWING YOU NORMALLY I WOULD SAY 
END OF TERRACED HOUSE BUT OF COURSE IN TORBAY 
WE SAY END OF TERRACE VILLA FAR MORE SOPHISTICATED VILLA 
IT'S AROUND ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD IT'S A STURDY PROPERTY 
IT CAN TAKE A BATTERING FROM A STORMY SEA NIGHT 
IT'S GOT LOADS OF CHARM AND CHARACTER INSIDE 
THIS MUST BE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
WELL IT SOUNDS INTERESTING IT LOOKS INTERESTING IT DOES 
YEAH YOU LIKE YEAH WE DO LIKE 
OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GOT THE PARKING FOR THE MOBILE HOME SORTED OUT 
SO WHERE'S THAT GOING TO GO 
UM YOU'RE ALL LOOKING AT ME AREN'T YOU YEAH I'M 
THAT'S WORK IN PROGRESS AND I'M WORKING ON THAT ONE 
AND I'LL BE BACK WITH AN ANSWER AS SOON AS I CAN 
WE COULD DISCUSS IT NOW I THINK LET'S DISCUSS THE HOUSE 
YEAH NOT GOT TIME FOR THAT NOW NO MOVING ON 
ALL RIGHT HE DOESN'T WANT TO RELEASE THE INFORMATION 
GO IN THERE ACT LIKE CHILDREN IN THERE 
THINK OF IT AS YOUR OWN PLACE AND ENJOY IT 
ALL RIGHT O. K. THEN GO ON 
IT IS LOVELY SEE WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH IT TRANSFORM THE PLACE O. K. 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO PARK IT 
RIGHT NOW AS I SAID THAT'S WORK IN PROGRESS AND I WAS THINKING 
YOU'RE GOING TO RUN AWAY BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'LL GO 
HE'S GOT NO IDEA 
O. K. THIS LOOKS INTERESTING YEAH A LITTLE VESTIBULE ENTRANCE 
BOY OH BOY CHRISTIAN LET'S SEE JUST SEE WHAT YOU DID 
IF THEY ARE GOING TO LIKE THE HOUSE I'M SURE THEY WILL 
I LIKE THE FIREPLACE YEAH IT'S A NICE FIREPLACE 
WE COULD LIGHT A NICE REAL FIRE IN THAT'S GOOD YEAH 
THE FIRE IN THERE IS READY I WAS THINKING ABOUT LIGHTING IT 
SHOULD I LIGHT THE FIRE I'LL LEAVE IT 
I'LL STAND OUTSIDE WITH HEADPHONES ON 
YEAH AND IF I'M GOING TO BE COLD THEY CAN BE COLD 
I LIKE THE WINDOW IT'S A NICE FEATURE WINDOW ISN'T IT M. M. M. 
RADIATOR OVER THERE 
HE DID POINT OUT A RADIATOR THOUGH 
THAT SMACKS TO ME OF NOT BEING THAT INTERESTED 
YEAH BUT THEN AS HE'S AN ENGINEER WHO LIKES BUILDING THING 
MAYBE A RADIATOR IS THE EPICENTRE OF EXCITEMENT FOR HIM 
IT CONTAINS HOT WATER HOT WATER MAKES STEAM 
STEAM ENGINES STEAM POWERS A TRAIN 
HE'S EXCITED ABOUT RADIATORS NATURALLY 
I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THIS WALLPAPER 
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THE WALLPAPER 
THIS WOULD MAKE A NICE DINING ROOM LOOKING AT IT AT THIS STAGE MM HMM 
YES INTERESTING ROOM I THINK THAT COSY 
IF THIS RUNS INTO THE KITCHEN 
THEN THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DINING AREA ISN'T IT 
INTERESTING ROOM WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
O. K. WE'VE HAD A COSY WE'VE HAD AN INTERESTING 
AND HE'S LOOKED AT THE RADIATOR AND THOUGHT OH THAT'S NICE OH 
SO MAKE THAT INTO AN ARCH TAKE IT THROUGH YEAH 
RSJ IN THERE 
HAS HE SAID RSJ HE'S TALKING ABOUT OPENING UP THE TWO RECEPTION ROOMS 
PERSONALLY THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS I KIND OF LIKE IT THE WAY IT IS 
IF THEY WANT MORE LIGHT IN THERE IT'S ALL ABOUT DECOR AND LIGHTING 
RIGHT AND THE KITCHEN THE KITCHEN 
I LIKE IT WHEN YOU GO INTO THE KITCHEN IN THE SEASIDE THEME 
IT'S A GALLEY KITCHEN 
I'M NOT TOO KEEN ON ALL THESE FISHING THINGS HANGING DOWN 
O. K. SPIDER CATCHERS 
IT'S NICE WHEN YOU'RE IN A SEASIDE TOWN 
TO HAVE YOUR PLASTIC FISH STUCK ON THE WALL 
IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO MODERNISE IT ISN'T IT IT'S NOT TITCHY 
IT'S A REASONABLE SIZE IT'S BIGGER THAN THE KITCHEN WE HAVE 
I THINK IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO COOK A MEAL FOR EIGHT OR TEN PEOPLE IN 
AND DO BUFFETS LIKE WE DO FOR ALL TWENTY SEVEN OF THEM 
WHEN THEY ALL COME TOGETHER RIGHT 
YOU'VE FOUND THE MEASURE OF THEM I UNDERSTAND THEM 
THEY LIKE ENTERTAINING THEY LOVE A KITCHEN 
TO ME THE KITCHEN WILL GET THEM 
THIS PLACE IS ALL ABOUT LIFESTYLE 
YOU COULD WALK DOWN TO THE FISH MARKET 
WHERE THE TRAWLERS COME IN UNLOAD THERE INTO THE MARKET 
BUY YOUR FRESH BRIXHAM SOLE BRING IT UP HERE COOK IT IN THERE 
WITH YOUR PLASTIC LOBSTERS ON THE CEILING AND VOILA MARVELLOUS 
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S THE BATHROOM 
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE OLD FASHIONED BUT ISN'T A BAD SIZE 
IT'S A SMASHING SIZE YES 
NOW THIS BATHROOM IT'S HUGE IT'S HUGE 
I THINK THERE'S THINGS YOU COULD DO HERE 
IT HASN'T GOT A SHOWER OVER THE BATH OR 
NO BUT I THINK YOU'VE GOT ROOM TO PUT A SHOWER IN HAVEN'T YOU YES 
IF HE CAN PUT UP AN RSJ IN THE LOUNGE 
HE CAN PUT A SHOWER UP IN THE BATHROOM 
BUT IT'S NOT A BAD SIZED ROOM NO THIS IS NICE YEAH 
YEAH THIS IS A NICE SIZED ROOM COSY 
PART OF THE SAME CHARACTER WINDOW THAT WE HAVE GOT DOWNSTAIRS 
IT'S A STRANGE SHAPE THIS ROOM 
YOU LOOK AT THE BED IT'S ALL SKEW WHIFF ISN'T IT 
IT'S THIS WALL HERE ISN'T IT 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BORDER WALL AND THE GARDEN IT GOES OFF AT AN ANGLE 
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S AN OLD HOUSE 
IT'S NOT A NEW BUILD WHERE IT'S BORING AND BLAND AND SQUARE 
THIS HAS GOT CHARM NOW WE KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY DON'T WANT 
WELL I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT 
AH NOW I CAN SEE THE SEA RIGHT THE VIEW YES 
YOU CAN EITHER HAVE AN UNINTERRUPTED SEA VIEW 
BUT HERE I LIKE THE WAY IT'S FRAMED 
BEHIND THE ROOFTOPS AND THE CHIMNEY 
THE ARTIST LOWRY WOULD REALLY BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT 
I THINK THAT THESE ROOMS UP HERE WILL PROBABLY ONLY BE USED WHEN WE WERE INUNDATED YES I KNOW 
BUT I DARE SAY THE BOYS HAVE GOT SOME IDEAS 
O. K. THAT WAS O. K. IT WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT FLAT 
I WANT TO STIR IT UP 
I WANT TO CREATE SOME WAVES OF EXCITEMENT IN THERE 
ARE YOU JOINING ME I DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE 
BARBARA WHEN YOU FIRST CAME IN THIS HOUSE WITH CHRIS 
I THINK YOU DEFINITELY NOTICED THE FACT THAT IT FEELS QUITE SMALL 
AND A LITTLE BIT DARK YEAH 
WHICH IS NICE IF YOU WANT TO HUG SOMEONE WHICH IS ONE GOOD THING 
BUT IS THIS WHAT YOU WERE EXPECTING YEAH IT WAS ACTUALLY 
FROM THE OUTSIDE I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT WAS WHAT I WAS GOING TO FIND 
YEAH SO NO BIG SURPRISES NO 
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS 
WHEN YOU COME IN HERE THEY'VE GOT THIS WILLIAM MORRIS WALLPAPER HERE 
WHICH IS LOVELY BUT IN THIS SPACE 
I THINK IT JUST IS QUITE DARK EN MASSE 
IT'S A BIT FUSSY ISN'T IT 
AND YOU'VE GOT SOME VERY SIMPLE DECORATIVE FEATURES 
STRIP THE WALLPAPER OFF PAINT IT WHITE YOU COULD SEE THEM BETTER 
KIND OF LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN HERE YEAH 
NOW THIS IS MUCH A SIMPLER STYLE 
AND I'M THINKING IT MIGHT BE MORE YOUR TASTE 
IT IS I LIKE THESE PLAIN WALLS 
THEY'RE NOT VERY BIG ROOMS DOWNSTAIRS 
SO IT IS RATHER CLEVER THAT THEY'VE KEPT ALL THE WALLS NICE AND LIGHT AND PLAIN 
AND IS THIS YOUR TASTE AND YOUR STYLE YES IT WOULD BE YEAH 
YEAH I THINK THIS WORKS IN HERE 
YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE IT FEEL BIGGER 
BY PAINTING THE SKIRTING BOARDS TO PUSH THE SPACE OUT A BIT 
THE CARPET A LOT OF PEOPLE IN DEVON HAVE THIS RUSTY COLOURED CARPET 
ONLY BECAUSE THE SOIL DOWN HERE IS SO RED 
WHEN YOU WALK IT IN THE HOUSE IT RUINS THE CARPETS 
SO THEY KEEP THESE EARTHY COLOURS TO HIDE THE STAINS 
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WE LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY 
O. K. YOU'VE GOT AN ENTRANCE HERE SO YOU CAN SHUNT IN 
BRING IN ALL THE STUFF 
THE ROLLING STOCK IT'S SO LONG YOU COULD BUILD A MASSIVE SHED 
AND WORK ON REAL TRAINS HERE IT'S A NICE IDEA IT IS 
HERE IS THE OTHER PROBLEM PARKING OF YOUR MOBILE HOME 
YES I THINK THIS HAS GOT THE POTENTIAL HERE 
DO ME A FAVOUR PACE IT 
GO ON ONE TWO THREE 
HOW MANY FOOT IS YOUR MOBILE HOME CHRIS 
SEVEN EIGHT THERE WE ARE THERE 
TWENTY FOUR FOOT I RECKON THAT'S TWENTY FOUR FOOT AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS 
PERFECTION SO ALL THE OTHER HOUSES DOWN HERE 
THEY'VE KNOCKED A BIT OUT YOU COULD PUT YOUR MOBILE HOME IN EASILY 
A MOBILE EXTENSION WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF ROOM IN WHICH TO REVERSE 
A BIT OF ADJUSTMENT BUT NOTHING TOO DIFFICULT 
AS IF CHRISTIAN DESIGNED IT FOR YOU 
IT COMES AT A PRICE THOUGH AND IT'S TIME TO GUESS THE PRICE 
CHRIS COME WITH ME

BUT YES IT'S VERY NICE 
YOU COULD TURN THAT INTO A LITTLE MINI LIBRARY WHEN YOU WALK IN 
A LITTLE VESTIBULE OF BOOKS 
THEY WANT TO MAKE IT A TOILET NOT A LIBRARY 
THEY WERE CONVINCED IT WAS A TOILET 
AND CAN'T ACCEPT THAT IT COULD BE ANYTHING ELSE

I SAID BLANK CANVAS I SHOULD HAVE SAID BUILDING SITE YEAH 
AND HERE MUST BE OH RIGHT O. K. 
DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A KITCHEN 
PROBABLY A KITCHEN YES IT'S GOT THE PLUMBING 
IT'S GOT THE PLUMBING THERE WHICH COULD BE FITTED UP QUITE NICE IT'S ONLY A SMALL KITCHEN 
BUT IT'S SIX FOOT BY TEN FOOT YES 
OH HE'S DOING HIS MEASURING VIRTUAL MEASURING 
CHRIS TOLD ME THIS TIP AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS TIP YOU'RE A HIGH AS YOUR ARMS 
YOU ARE AS LONG AS YOUR ARMS 
FINGERTIP TO FINGERTIP IS YOUR HEIGHT 
O. K. SO CHRIS WILL BE DOING THIS IN THERE COS HE KNOWS HE IS SIX F. T. 
AND HE MEASURES EVERYTHING LIKE THIS WHICH IS A BIT WEIRD BUT THAT IS WHAT HE IS DOING LOUNGE 
AFTER YOU 
O. K. THIS IS NOT BAD 
NOT A BAD SIZE 
YOU PACE IT CHRIS 
SO YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU WANTED TO LIE DOWN YOU COULDN'T IN THIS CAVITY 
THREE FOUR FIVE IT'S GOT TO BE FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN F. T. INTO THE WINDOW HE'S PACING AGAIN 
NOW CHRIS KNOWS THAT A WIDE PACE IS ABOUT A FOOT FOR HIM AND HE'LL BE 
WALKING EVERYWHERE LIKE THAT MEASURING CONSTANTLY 
SO ONE PACE IS A FOOT 
I'M GOING A FOOT 
SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW O. K. 
YOU NEED TO WORK THESE THINGS OUT YOU JUST GO AT THEM 
TOO QUICKLY YOU NEED TO PACE IT OUT AND THINK ABOUT DOORS 
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT 
WE COULD WATCH OUR SEAL 
OUR LITTLE SEAL OUR VERY OWN SEAL 
BE LIKE HAVING A PET O. K. NICE VIEW LOVELY VIEW 
THE DOORS MUST OPEN INSIDE THEN YOU CAN GET SOME NICE FRESH AIR IN 
YOU COULD OPEN THAT AND YOU SMELL THE SEA THAT'S IT AH LOVELY LOVELY 
O. K. YES 
YES PLENTY OF ROOM FOR YOUR PICTURES YEAH I KNOW 
AND YOU COULD EVEN SIT HERE PAINTING COULDN'T YOU IN ACTUAL FACT 
YES SO YOU MIGHT GET FED UP OF PAINTING THE SAME VIEW ALL OF THE TIME 
I KNOW WE INTEND TRAVELLING AROUND IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND LOOKING 
HANG ON DID HE JUST SAY YOU MIGHT GET FED UP WITH THAT VIEW 
THAT VIEW THERE IS ONE THAT CHANGES THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR WITH THE WEATHER 
THE SHIPS THE PEOPLE THE TOURISTS THE SIGHTS THE SMELLS THE SOUNDS YOU ARE SO RIGHT 
THAT'S NOT A STATIC SCENE THAT'S NOT A FIELD 
HALF THE THINGS OUT THERE ARE FLYING THAT'S A MOVING LIVING BREATHING ENTITY 
ANOTHER NICE VIEW OUT INTO THE BAY IT'S LOVELY WOULD YOU SAY THIS IS A DOUBLE BEDROOM 
IT'S A BIT NARROW THAT WAY ISN'T IT 
YES I THINK WE COULD PROBABLY HAVE TWO BUNK BEDS ALONG HERE TWO DOUBLE BUNK BEDS 
AND ONE DOWN THERE 
AND ONE THERE WE CAN SLEEP THEM ALL WHEN THEY ARRIVE 
THERE IS ANOTHER FACTOR THERE IS NO GARDEN HERE TO KEEP UP 
TRUE TRUE 
THERE IS NO GARDEN HERE BUT YOU HAVE GOT FANTASTIC BALCONIES YOU COULD HAVE A LITTLE FLOWER BOX 
DEMONSTRATION GIVEN POP THAT IN DOWN THERE 
AND IF YOU WANT TO GO AND WEED THE UNWANTED PLANTS 
OF THE WATER YOU CAN GO IN THAT SEAWEED 
YOU CAN HAVE THE OCEAN GARDEN AS YOUR GARDEN 
RIGHT O. K. BATHROOM ON ITS WAY A NICE MODERN BATHROOM 
IF THIS IS A TASTE OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING FOR THE WHOLE PLACE I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE NICE 
THEY DID SAY THAT WE COULD PUT OUR OWN INPUT INTO IT IF WE WERE INTERESTED IN TAKING IT FURTHER 
WE HAVE THROWN THEM A CURVE BALL 
AND IT'S NOT WHAT THEY EXPECTED BUT WITH A LITTLE COMPROMISE WHY NOT LIVE IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
IT'S NOT WHAT THEY ASKED FOR BUT IT'S A VERY INTERESTING PROPOSITION 
THIS IS A BIT WIDER YOU COULD PUT A BED THAT WAY CAN'T YOU YOU COULD YES 
I THINK THEY SEEM VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THIS SERIOUSLY 
I WAS SLIGHTLY CONCERNED COS I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE TO THEIR TASTE BUT IT'S THIS VIEW 
I THINK THAT'S WANGLED IT 
THAT'S A BIT BIGGER THAN WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY GOING TO BE THIS WIDE 
YES I DID TOO IT CUTS BACK INTO OPTICAL ILLUSION 
WE HAVE GOT THREE ONE DOUBLE AND THEN THE OTHERS HAVE GOT 
O. K. SO THIS AGAIN ALTHOUGH IT'S ONLY A BOX ROOM IT'S GOT CAPABILITIES OF HAVING 
EITHER ONE SINGLE BED OR BUNK BEDS 
BUNK BEDS FOR THE GRANDCHILDREN SO YES IT'S INTERESTING IT'S INTERESTING 
WELL ROMEO IT'S TIME WE LEFT THIS BALCONY AND SHOWED THOSE TWO WHAT LIFE COULD REALLY BE LIKE HERE 
CHRIS COME WITH ME SO WE HAVE ONE TWO THREE BEDROOMS POTENTIAL LOOK UP FOURTH 
GET UP THERE AND HAVE A LOOK IT'S A VERY BIG SPACE UP THERE RIGHT LET'S GO UP 
NOW THIS COULD BE AN ARTIST'S STUDIO UP THERE FOR BARBARA 
COULD BE SIMPLY STORAGE 
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK 
I'M SURPRISED IT'S BIGGER THAN I EXPECTED SO YES IT'S INTERESTING IT IS 
COME BACK DOWN 
SO EXTRA SPACE UP THERE EXTRA SPACE UP THERE THERE IS 
THERE IS ONE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THIS PLACE IT'S ALWAYS THE MOTOR HOME AND CARS 
IT IS THE PARKING AND THE SHED SITUATION 
AND THE SHED SITUATION BARBARA DOES LIKE HER GARDEN SO THERE ARE A FEW ISSUES 
CAR PARKING CAN BE SORTED FOR FOUR HUNDRED A YEAR YOU CAN PARK YOUR CAR IN ANY OF BRIXHAM'S PUBLIC CAR PARKS 
FOUR HUNDRED FOR A PERMIT VERY REASONABLE 
FOR THE MOTOR HOME YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE PUT AN ADVERT OUT AND SEE IF ANYONE WANTS TO RENT YOU SPACE 
THAT'S POTENTIAL 
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS PROPERTY WHICH IS NEXT DOOR TO THE ONE YOU'VE JUST SEEN 
IT HAS BEEN DONE BY THE SAME DEVELOPER 
NOW THIS IS ONLY A ONE BEDROOM PROPERTY BUT IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE FINISHED SPEC OH IT'S LOVELY 
WHEN YOU WALK ROUND THIS PROPERTY YOU CAN SEE THE BATHROOM IS IN IT'S GOT THE FIREPLACE IN THE LOUNGE 
SO ALL THE FEATURES AND OF COURSE FITTED KITCHEN SO IT BRINGS IT ALL ALIVE FOR YOU 
IT WAS HARD TO TELL IN THE OTHER ONE IT IS WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT SUCH A BLANK CANVAS BARE WALLS 
ALL I'M GOING TO SAY TO YOU IS IF YOU WERE READY AND THAT PROPERTY WAS RIGHT FOR YOU 
GET IN EARLY THIS IS THE PRIME MOMENT TO DIVE ON IN THERE 
COS YOU COULD TALK TO THE DEVELOPER HERE'S OUR DEPOSIT WE DON'T REALLY LIKE THESE WHITE GLOSS UNITS 
OR WE REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT FIREPLACE DOWNSTAIRS WE PREFER THIS THIS THIS AND THIS 
AND IF YOU WANT TO GO HIGH SPEC AND PUT IN A REALLY POSH KITCHEN MAYBE THERE IS A HALFWAY HOUSE 
WHERE YOU GO HERE'S SOME EXTRA MONEY BUT WE WANT THE FULL WORKS AND CAN YOU PUT IT IN 
A LOT OF MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT TO BRING IT UP TO THIS STATUS WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT MONEY 
I NEED AN EDWARD AND A CHRIS I CAN HEAR THEM COMING UP THE STAIRS 
VERY WELL TIMED COME ON IN NEXT TO BARBARA 
IT IS THE THIRD AND FINAL GUESS THE PRICE TIME YOU'RE LOSING 
AND I'M LOSING HE IS LOSING HAVE YOU GOT ONE RIGHT YET I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE NO 
I HAVE TENDED TO GO TOO HIGH 
THIS IS THE GLORY SHOT SO IT IS STILL MY SHOT AGAIN 
WOULD IT HELP YOU IF YOU GUESSED FIRST OR SECOND DO YOU THINK 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD REALLY 
I'LL GO FOR FIRST AGAIN AND GIVE BARBARA A BETTER CHANCE TO WIN AGAIN 
SO I'M GOING TO GO FOR 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
I THINK A BIT MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE OF THE PRIME POSITION 
BEING ON THE FRONT LIKE THIS AND THE WAY THEY ARE DEVELOPING IT AND IT IS SO MODERN 
I THINK TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
O. K. 
WELL WHAT CAN I SAY EXCELLENT THREE TIMES IN A ROW YOU GOT IT WRONG 
THREE TIMES IN A ROW CHRIS WHAT'S GOING ON I'M SORRY I'VE LET YOU DOWN AGAIN 
YOU'VE LET ME DOWN MASSIVELY BUT I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT HERE'S THE REAL PUNCH IN THE GUT SPOT ON 
SPOT ON THE PRICE OF THE PROPERTY IS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THERE YOU GO THREE BEDROOM PROPERTY FANTASTIC VIEWS 
RIGHT MORE IMPORTANTLY I SHOULD BE AN ESTATE AGENT 
YOU HAVE NOW SEEN ALL THREE PROPERTIES WE NEED A DECISION ABOUT WHICH ONE TO TEST DRIVE 
AND TO HELP YOU WITH THAT WE HAVE THE MAGICAL LAPTOP HERE 
WHO SHALL I ENTRUST THIS TO YOU CAN LEAVE THAT WITH ME ON THERE ARE IMAGES DETAILS 
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE PROPERTIES GO AWAY WITH IT NOT TOO FAR COS WE NEED THAT BACK 
LOOK AT THEM AND MAKE THE BIG DECISION OF WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO TEST DRIVE 
WE'LL DO THAT THANKS VERY MUCH HEAD THAT WAY SEE YOU LATER 
SEE YOU SOON AND WHILE THEY ARE FISHING FOR THAT RATHER IMPORTANT DECISION 
HERE'S A QUICK REMINDER FOR YOU AT HOME 
NOW MY CHOICE IS THE GENEROUSLY SIZED VICTORIAN VILLA SITUATED ON THE HILL TO THE NORTH OF BRIXHAM 
IT HAS FOUR GOOD SIZED BEDROOMS AND A KITCHEN WITH PLENTY OF SPACE 
FOR ENTERTAINING THE FAMILY AND IT'S A BARGAIN AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
DOWNSIZING A LITTLE OUR NEXT PROPERTY ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF TOWN ONLY HAS TWO BEDROOMS 
HOWEVER THE AMPLE PARKING AND PLEASANT VIEWS ARE A REAL BONUS 
MAKING THE PRICE TAG OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY VERY ATTRACTIVE 
AND LET'S NOT FORGET OUR WILD CARD CHOICE 
RIGHT AT THE HEART OF OLD BRIXHAM THE PILOT'S COTTAGE OFFERED NOT ONLY THE BEST SEA VIEWS AVAILABLE 
BUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY IN FROM THE BEGINNING AND CREATE THE HOUSE OF YOUR DREAMS ALL FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
NOTHING FISHY ABOUT THAT 
WE REMEMBER THE FRONT OF THIS ONE DON'T WE 
THAT WAS REALLY PRETTY I LIKED THAT FIREPLACE 
YOU DID I WASN'T KEEN NOT A BAD SIZED KITCHEN 
IT WAS ALL RIGHT 
BATHROOM WAS GOOD THAT WAS NOT A BAD SIZE 
AND IT WAS GOOD AREA THE WINDOWS AT THE FRONT WERE NICE 
GOOD BEDROOMS GOOD BEDROOMS ON IT YES INDEED RIGHT SO THIS HOUSE THEN 
OH THIS ONE THIS IS THE SECOND HOUSE THAT'S NICE 
NICE FRONTAGE PLENTY OF PARKING THERE WAS YEAH NICE BIG SITTING ROOM AND DINING AREA KITCHEN WAS 
KITCHEN WAS A BIT SMALL BUT ADEQUATE A BIT SMALL BUT ADEQUATE I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT 
TOOK THE WORDS OUT OF MY MOUTH 
O. K. THERE WAS A VIEW LOOKING OUT THE BACK TOWARDS THE PIPING AREA 
THE BATHROOM WAS NICE YES IT WAS A NICE BATHROOM 
BEDROOM SECOND BEDROOM WAS A NICE SIZE AND A NICE VIEW ACROSS TO SAINT MARY'S CHURCH 
THIS WAS INTERESTING YES IT WAS THE PILOT'S COTTAGE A WORK IN PROGRESS 
YES LOVELY VIEWS LOOKING OUTSIDE AND OVER BRIXHAM HARBOUR THE COMINGS 
AND TO INGS AND FRO INGS OF THE BOATS AND THE YACHTS 
WELL I THINK THEN WE HAVE NOW BOTH DECIDED WHICH ONE WE WOULD LIKE TO TEST DRIVE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
O. K. LET'S GO FOR IT 
O. K. 
O. K. BARBARA AND CHRIS YOU CHOSE MY PROPERTY PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
WE DID INDEED WE DID O. K. WHAT MADE YOU SO ATTRACTED TO MY HOUSE 
WELL OUT OF THE THREE IT GAVE US THE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WHICH IS PARKING 
SOME SPACE FOR THE KIDS TO RUN AROUND IT ALSO HAS THE SHED IN THE 
GARDEN WHICH WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME SAD THAT I AM 
AND THEN ALTHOUGH IT'S ONLY A TWO BEDROOM HOUSE WE CAN SORT OF SEE THE POTENTIAL THERE FOR ALTERING IT 
YEAH WELL HOLD THAT THOUGHT 
DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD BECAUSE IN A MINUTE WE ARE GOING TO LET 
YOU DO YOUR TEST DRIVE WHERE WE GIVE YOU THE HOUSE TO TREAT AS YOUR OWN 
BEFORE YOU DO THAT WE HAVE HAD OUR TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY SURVEYOR GIVE THIS HOUSE A GOING OVER 
NOW BASICALLY THE HOUSE GOT A VERY GOOD CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH 
HE DID SAY THAT THE GARDEN IS TERRACED AND ROUND THE 
PATIO AREA THERE IS NO RAILINGS YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT FOR WHEN THE GRANDKIDS VISIT YOU 
KNOW A BIT OF HEALTH AND SAFETY BUT APART FROM THAT YOU'RE LAUGHING GREAT 
GREAT O. K. BEFORE YOU DO YOUR TEST DRIVE WE NEED TO WORK OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING WE DO 
SO WE HAVE A GUIDE HERE WE HAVE A CHOICE OF THE MODEL VILLAGE 
THE STEAM RAILWAY OR I USED TO BE A TOUR GUIDE IN A CAVE SYSTEM HERE CALLED KENT'S CAVERN 
WHY DON'T WE GO AT TRIPLE SPEED AND DO ALL THREE 
IT'S A PLAN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING WE'LL SEE YOU LATER 
A TENSE MOMENT WILL THE MOTOR HOME FIT 
YES PERFECTLY 
AND WHILE BARBARA HAS A LOOK AROUND WILL THE SHED MEASURE UP TO CHRIS'S DEMANDING STANDARDS 
THERE IS NOTHING MORE RELAXING THAN A SPOT OF SKETCHING 
DON'T YOU THINK 
CAN I COME IN 
WELL I'M SORRY BUT IT'S A MEN'S PLACE ONLY THIS IS THE SHED THIS IS MY SHED 
THAT'S NOT FAIR 
I HAVE TO SAY WHILE YOU HAVE BEEN DOING YOUR TEST DRIVE WE HAVE BEEN HAVING A FABULOUS TIME 
I FEEL SLIGHTLY SICK AT THE CANDYFLOSS AND ROCK I'VE EATEN STEAM TRAINS ARE YOU JEALOUS 
I AM INDEED STALAGMITES AND STALACTITES 
WHICH ONE'S WHICH I LIKE STALAGMITES 
STALAGMITES THEY ARE THE ONES THAT GO UP 
STALACTITES WE HAVE LEARNT SOMETHING 
BUT ENOUGH OF US IT'S MORE ABOUT YOU NOW BECAUSE 
THIS HOUSE IS IT STILL FEELING NICE IS IT STILL FEELING LOVELY AND HOMELY 
YES WE LIKE THE FEEL OF THIS HOUSE WE DO INDEED YEAH 
IT'S GOT A NICE COSY ATMOSPHERE 
IT HAS INDEED WE LIKE THE IDEA OF THE UPSTAIRS BEDROOM AND ALTERATION POTENTIAL TO IT 
GOOD AND YOU LOOK AT HOME YEAH WE WERE WALKING ROUND 
PLANNING AND THINKING HOW WE COULD ALTER THINGS AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD SIGN WHEN YOU DO THAT 
SO THE BIG QUESTION WE CAN'T HOLD IT OFF ANY LONGER 
TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY THAT IS THE QUESTION O. K. 
WELL I THINK WE ARE GOING TO NEED SOME EXTRA TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT 
IT'S CERTAINLY GROWN ON ME AND I THINK IT TICKS SO MANY BOXES THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY IN THE RUNNING 
AND SO IT'S A DEFINITELY MAYBE ISN'T IT IT'S A DEFINITE MA YBE 
IT'S A DEFINITE MAYBE OH I THINK WE HAVE DONE WELL 
WE HAVE WE SHOULD LEAVE NOW WHILST WE ARE STILL AHEAD BECAUSE THERE ARE 
STILL OTHER PLACES FOR US TO GO AND VISIT
