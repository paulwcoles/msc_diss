BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO FEAR OF DEATH THEY ARE SORT OF UNSTOPPABLE 
SONTARANS ARE RUTHLESS 
THEY'RE TRULY BRUTAL NASTY MONSTROUS CREATURES 
TICK TICK TICK TICK 
TICK TICK TICK 
BOOM 
IT'S BATTLE STATIONS FOR THE DOCTOR WHO PRODUCTION TEAM 
AS THEY PLAN WITH MILITARY PRECISION THE SONTARANS' ATTACK AGAINST UNIT FORCES 
IT'S BIG BATTLE TIME IN THIS EPISODE AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME EVER 
ON SCREEN YOU GET TO SEE THE SONTARANS EN MASSE 
I JUST WANT TO SEE HORDES OF THEM ARMIES OF THEM 
MARCHING GUNS BATTLESHIPS ACTION 
TO SEE THESE SOLDIERS THESE FAMOUS SOLDIERS OF THE DOCTOR WHO UNIVERSE 
AT WAR IN BATTLE FIGHTING AND LOVING IT 
ALL TROOPS CODE RED 
THIS ISN'T WAR 
GET THEM OUT OF THERE 
THIS IS SPORT 
THEY'RE RUNNING LIKE SLIME BAIT FROM A SPIEL FOX 
GET THEM OUT OF THERE 
GOD SAVE US 
NORTH AMERICA ONLINE 
UNITED KINGDOM ONLINE 
NORTH KOREA ONLINE 
THE HONOUR OF BATTLE 
THE GLORY 
WITH THE COORDINATION OF TOM OUR STUNT COORDINATOR 
AND AILSA OUR CHOREOGRAPHER 
WE REALLY FELT THE FULL FORCE OF THEIR WARRIOR TECHNIQUES 
THEY'RE TRULY BRUTAL NASTY MONSTROUS CREATURES AND THAT'S WHAT SONTARANS ARE THEY FIGHT 
AT THE MOMENT WE'RE WAITING TO GO AND SHOOT THE BIG BATTLE 
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING WITH THE UNIT TROOPS 
ACTION 
AND SHOOTING VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THEM 
IT'S AN INTERESTING WAY TO SPEND A MORNING CERTAINLY 
COME ON COME ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THAT IS THE SOLDIERS RUNNING AROUND HALF PANICKING 
THEN THE SONTARANS COME IN INTO A SET LINE 
AND THEN WE HAD TO WORK OUT DIFFERENT SCENARIOS 
RUNNING FALLING AND TRYING TO SHOOT BUT THEIR GUNS ARE JAMMED 
I THINK WE REALLY DID GET A SENSE OF SCALE IN THAT WE HAD 
THESE TWO BIG FORCES FACING EACH OTHER 
AND THEN THROWING IN OUR SET PIECE SPECIAL EFFECTS 
IN EPISODE FIVE MAKES FOR A VERY DRAMATIC SEQUENCE 
ACTION 
YOU 
SHOULD 
YOU 
LIVE 
THE SUN HAS GONE AND YOU'RE ALL ALONE 
AND YOU KNOW 
YOU'RE MY DREAM 
ONE OF THE PIECES OF THE BATTLE WHEN IT COMMENCES BETWEEN THE SONTARANS AND THE UNIT SOLDIERS 
IS WHEN UNIT CALL IN THE VALIANT 
VALIANT FIRE AT WILL 
THERE'S A VERY GOOD INTERNAL CORRIDOR WITH A LOAD OF WINDOWS DOWN ONE SIDE 
SO WE DECIDED THAT WOULD BE OUR KIND OF BLAST AREA 
HERE FOR THIS PARTICULAR EFFECT WE'VE GOT 
SONTARANS THAT ARE GOING TO BE IN A MILITARY STYLE MARCH 
AND THEN THEY ARE GOING TO GET HIT BY THIS ALMIGHTY BOOM THAT'S COMING FROM THE VALIANT 
WHAT WE'VE GOT IF WE COME IN HERE WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF AIR CYLINDERS 
WHAT WE HAVE IS AN AIR SYSTEM WHICH WHEN I CHARGE THESE BIG BLACK CYLINDERS 
I CALL THEM A WOOFER I CHARGE IT TO A SET PRESSURE AND IT'S GOT A QUICK ACTING VALVE 
WHEN I PRESS THE BUTTON IT FIRES LOTS OF AIR 
AND INSIDE THAT I'VE GOT SOME SILICON GLASS 
IT LOOKS LIKE BROKEN UP GLASS BUT IT'S MADE OF SILICON WHICH IS COMPLETELY SAFE 
I'VE GOT IT ON A TIMER SYSTEM SO WHEN I PRESS THE BUTTON IT'LL GO BANG BANG BANG BANG 
AND SO IT'LL JUST FOLLOW THEM AND THEN THEY'LL JUST TAKE SHELTER 
THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT 
ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES FOR THE SONTARANS IS THEY'RE WEARING BIG HELMETS AND ESSENTIALLY BODY ARMOUR 
BECAUSE OF THAT WE CAN FIRE THINGS AT THEM 
I DO HAVE AN AMOUNT OF SHATTER GLASS WHICH I MAY PUT IN HERE 
IT JUST ADDS TO THE DEBRIS AND TO ESSENTIALLY JUST CREATE MORE MAYHEM IN THERE 
THEY CAN BE THIS SIDE WHEN IT GOES BANG 
WE JUST NEED TO SEE THE TIMING PEOPLE WALK IN ON THAT SO THEY'RE ALL CLEARED IN THEIR POSITIONS 
THERE'S NOT MUCH IN THIS KEEP IT MORE OF THE SAME MATE 
I'LL LIAISE WITH DANNY WHO IS THE S. F. X. SUPERVISOR 
WE WORK OUT SAFE DISTANCES' 
WHAT'S GOING TO COME THROUGH AND THE RIGHT POSITIONS FOR THE SONTARANS 
AND I JUST GO THROUGH WITH THEM GETTING THEIR SET POSITIONS 
WE ARE TRYING TO WORK IN BETWEEN EACH OF THE BLASTS SO WE'VE GOT THE BLAST GOING THROUGH THEM ALL 
THIS KIND OF POSITION IS WHEN IT GOES BANG THREE STEPS INTO THIS 
YEAH THAT'D BE GOOD WOULDN'T IT IF WE COULD MINIMISE THEIR STEPS 
THEN EVERYONE CAN STAND JUST OFF THEIR POSITION AND WALK INTO THEM 
YOU HAVE DANNY WHOSE BUSINESS IS TO DO WITH THE PHYSICAL EFFECTS 
YOU'VE GOT TOM WHO'S GOT TO DO THE STUNTS 
AND YOU'VE GOT ME WHO GETS FROM THEM WHAT I NEED TO TELL THE STORY 
BECAUSE IT'S A VALIANT BLAST I'LL BE CUTTING FROM THE VALIANT FIRING TO THIS EXPLODING 
THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE WE'LL STAGGER THEM ALL THEY CAN ALL TAKE TWO OR THREE STEPS BACK 
I'LL GET A LITTLE BIT OF MARCHING THREE OR FOUR STEPS THAT'D BE FANTASTIC THAT'S WHAT WE WILL DO 
THE HARDEST THING FOR THE DIRECTOR IS TO FORGET 
THAT DANGEROUS THINGS ARE GOING ON BECAUSE THE IMPORTANT THING 
THE ONLY THING THAT'LL BE LEFT BEHIND IS THE SHOT IN THE CAMERA 
THAT COLLABORATION IS ALL TO DO WITH THAT FOCUS ON THAT MOMENT 
CLOSER YOU TWO COME CLOSER LOVELY IN THERE 
REHEARSAL GO NICK 
AND LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT 
RIGHT LEFT BANG 
RIGHT THERE'S ONE OR TWO SLIGHTLY OUT I WON'T MENTION NAMES 
IF WE CAN JUST BACK UP AND TRY THAT AGAIN 
O. K. REHEARSING LEFT RIGHT 
LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT BANG 
THAT'S BETTER GUYS THAT WAS A LOT BETTER 
HOPEFULLY IT SHOULD LOOK QUITE AMAZING TEN SONTARANS MARCHING 
UP AND DOWN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS VALIANT EXPLOSION 
AND THEN EVERYTHING BLOWS OUT AND TEN PEOPLE FLY TO THE GROUND 
THE TRICK WITH THESE SEQUENCES IS TO MAKE THEM LOOK DANGEROUS NOT BE DANGEROUS 
WITH EVERYTHING SET THE PRESSURE IS NOW ON THE STUNT 
AND SPECIAL EFFECTS TEAMS TO QUITE LITERALLY BLOW THEM ALL AWAY IN JUST ONE SHOT 
TURNING OVER 
AND ACTION 
LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT 
I WAS REALLY PLEASED WITH IT THEY ARE NOT STUNT GUYS AND THEY'RE S. A.'S 
AND THEY'RE REALLY GOOD THEY DID EXCELLENT THEY GAVE US EVERYTHING 
OBVIOUSLY WE ALWAYS WORK AS A TEAM AND I TRUST DANNY 
I REALLY DO HONEST YEAH I WAS REALLY PLEASED 
YOU'RE GOING OVER IT IN YOUR HEAD ONE TWO THREE 
YOU'RE EXPECTING IT BUT YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE TO GO WITH IT 
YEAH NO PRETTY GOOD HOPEFULLY IT LOOKED GOOD 
SAW A LOAD OF SMOKE 
THEN THERE'S US LYING ON THE FLOOR AND SPARKS COMING FROM THE CEILING 
FUN THOUGH GETTING BETTER AND BETTER WORKING ON THIS EH 
HA HA HA 
THAT'S BRILLIANT 
GETTING A TASTE FOR IT DOCTOR NOT AT ALL NOT ME 
WE'VE BROUGHT MONSTERS BACK IN THE PAST MAINLY DALEKS AND CYBERMEN 
BOTH OF THOSE ARE EMOTIONLESS ROBOTS 
IDENTIFY FIRST IDENTIFY 
IT'S LIKE STEPHEN HAWKING MEETS THE SPEAKING CLOCK 
THEY HAVE THOSE FORMAL SPEECH PATTERNS AND WITH THE SONTARANS 
IT IS SO NICE TO HAVE A RETURNING ENEMY EN MASSE 
WHO HAVE JUST GOT MUCH MORE CHARACTERFUL SPEECH 
IT SEEMS WE MUST REVERT TO BASIC SONTARAN STRATAGEM ONE 
WE WILL RAVAGE THIS PLANET 
PREPARE WEAPONS WIPE THEM OUT 
EVERY LAST STINKING HUMAN BEAST 
THE SONTARANS HAVE BEEN ON DOCTOR WHO I THINK FOUR TIMES PRIOR TO THIS 
WORK IT MAKE IT DO IT MAKES US 
HARDER BETTER FASTER STRONGER WORK IT HARDER 
NOW THAT THAT DON'T KILL ME 
CAN ONLY MAKE ME STRONGER 
I NEED YOU TO HURRY UP NOW 
COS I CAN'T WAIT MUCH LONGER 
I KNOW I GOT TO BE RIGHT NOW 
COS I CAN'T GET MUCH WRONGER 
MAN I'VE BEEN WAITIN' ALL NIGHT NOW 
THAT'S HOW LONG I'VE BEEN ON YA 
WORK IT HARDER MAKE IT BETTER 
DO IT FASTER MAKES US STRONGER I NEED YOU RIGHT NOW 
RIGHT NOW HARDER BETTER STRONGER FASTER 
I NEED YOU RIGHT NOW 
WORK IT HARDER MAKE IT BETTER 
DO IT FASTER MAKES US STRONGER I NEED YOU RIGHT NOW 
I NEED YOU RIGHT NOW 
THEY FIRST APPEARED WITH JON PERTWEE TOWARDS THE END OF HIS TIME I THINK 
YOU ARE THE ONE CALLED THE DOCTOR YOU KNOW WHO I AM 
I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU 
THAT WAS ELISABETH SLADEN'S FIRST EVER STORY ASK HER ABOUT THEM 
I'M VERY FOND OF THE SONTARANS 
THEY WERE MY FIRST MONSTER THEREFORE THEY WERE MY FIRST SHOCK SURPRISE 
THERE IS NONE OF YOUR KIND 
THE HAIR IS FINER THE THORAX OF A DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION 
ALSO THEY RETURNED FOR ME WHEN WE WERE ON O. B. IN DARTMOOR 
AND WHEN YOU DO SEE A MONSTER AS A CHARACTER YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE YOU HAVE THE AMMUNITION 
YOU REMEMBER AND IT ADDS ANOTHER LAYER 
THE SONTARAN 
IT CAN'T BE YOU MAY HAVE SEEN ONE OF US BUT YOU'RE IDENTICAL 
THE SAME UGLY IDENTICAL EARS THE SAME NOSE 
AND THEN THEY WERE USED AGAIN IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN COLIN BAKER WAS THE DOCTOR 
NICOLA BRYANT WAS PERI AND PATRICK TROUGHTON AND FRASER HIND CAME BACK 
WHO WAS THAT 
MY PARTICULAR TWO WERE I THINK VAAL AND STIKE 
THEY KIND OF SOUND WARLIKE DON'T THEY 
BORIS YES SIR 
RETURN TO THE CRAFT AND CONTACT SONTARAN HIGH COMMAND 
BLESS THEM THEY HAD TO FILM IN SEVILLE IN THE HEIGHT OF THE SUMMER IN TEMPERATURES OF ONE HUNDRED TEN DEGREES 
AND THEY WERE WEARING THESE ALL OVER RUBBER SUITS THESE GREAT RUBBER MASKS 
AND WITHIN SECONDS THEY WERE SWIMMING IN PERSPIRATION INSIDE 
SO WE HAD TO BE QUITE SWIFT WITH FILMING THEIR SCENES 
OH 
THEIR APPEARANCE IS FUNCTIONAL BRUTAL AND ELEMENTAL IN A WAY 
THERE'S NOTHING ELEGANT ABOUT THEM AND THEY'RE DEAD BUTCH 
WHAT WAS STRIKING ABOUT THEM ALWAYS WAS THE DESIGN 
NOT JUST THE PHYSICAL DESIGN BUT ALSO THE DESIGN OF THE RACE THE IDEA OF THE RACE 
BUNCH OF CLONES WHO LIVED TO KILL REALLY 
A WAR THAT IS EXCELLENT 
OH SO YOU LIKE WAR EH WHO DOES NOT 
THEY'RE WARLIKE EVERYTHING THEY DO IS MILITARY 
THEY'RE BRED FOR WAR THEY LOVE IT 
A TYPICALLY SONTARAN ATTITUDE ONLY ONE THING MATTERS TO COMPLETE THE REPAIRS TO MY SHIP 
AND RETURN TO THE GLORIOUS WAR THAT IS MY DESTINY 
NOTHING MUST INTERFERE WITH THAT 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO FEAR OF DEATH THEY ARE SORT OF UNSTOPPABLE 
YOU WILL FACE ME SIR 
AARGH 
THEY'RE A CLONE RACE AND THE REASON WHY THEY'VE DEVELOPED CLONING 
IS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN FIGHTING A WAR FOR FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS 
WITH THEIR ARCH ENEMIES THE RUTANS ACROSS VARIOUS GALAXIES 
THE GLORIOUS SONTARAN ARMY RECKONS ITS NUMBERS 
IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS 
THEY HAVE JUST THE ONE WEAKNESS APART FROM LOOKING IN THE MIRROR WHICH MUST DEPRESS THEM UNUTTERABLY 
THEY HAVE A PROBING VENT AT THE BACK OF THEIR NECK I LOVE THAT 
THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO FACE THEIR ENEMIES IT'S THEIR ONLY WEAKNESS 
WHICH OVER THE YEARS ON DOCTOR WHO HAS BEEN DEALT WITH IN BRILLIANT WAYS 
AND THAT'S HOW YOU SEE THEM OFF REALLY SHOOT SOMETHING INTO THEIR PROBIC VENT 
SOUNDS APPALLING 
THEY'RE VERY EASY TO DESCRIBE YOU SORT OF GET WHAT THEY ARE 
THE IDEA OF WHAT THIS RACE SHOULD BE AND THE LOOK IS VERY STRIKING 
THE BAKED POTATO HEAD 
DIDN'T I TELL YOU YOU MIGHT NOT FIND MY FACE PLEASING 
AND IT'S A GREAT GAG WHICH THEY'VE DONE EVERY TIME THEY'VE APPEARED 
THEY'VE GOT THIS DOME SHAPED HELMET WHICH THEY REMOVE 
AND THE HEAD IS EXACTLY THE SAME SHAPE UNDERNEATH IT'S GREAT 
THE BRIEF WITH THE SONTARAN WAS TO KEEP THE TRADITIONAL LOOK 
THE WAY THE HEAD LOOKS THE WAY IT LOOKED 
IN THE SEVENTIES THAT LOVELY DOME SHAPE 
BUT OBVIOUSLY NOW THIRTY FORTY YEARS ON 
WE CAN TOTALLY UPDATE THE TECHNOLOGY 
NOW IT'S A PROSTHETIC MAKE UP IT'S IN TWO PIECES 
THERE'S THE LARGE DOME PART OF HIS HEAD 
AND THEN THE FACIAL PIECE WHICH GOES ON 
WE GLUE IT DOWN TO THE FACE SO THAT AS THE PERFORMER MOVES THEIR FACE EVERYTHING MOVES WITH THE FACE 
WONDERFUL 
I WANTED SONTARANS TO BE SHORT THAT'S MY MENTAL IMAGE OF THEM 
THE INITIAL IDEA WAS THAT THEY WERE QUITE SQUAT THEN THEY GOT QUITE TALL 
BUT WE'VE MADE THEM SQUAT AGAIN 
IS THAT A REFERENCE TO MY HEIGHT 
SHORT ANSWER YES 
PITY WORDS ARE THE WEAPONS OF WOMENFOLK I MUST JUDGE YOU UNFIT 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO BITE OUR ANKLES 
ARGH AH 
ONE OF THE DESIGN BRIEFS FOR THE SONTARANS WAS THAT THEY WERE QUITE SHORT STOCKY CREATURES 
SO WE PICKED THE SIZE BASICALLY SAYING WE'D GO WITH FIVE FOOT TALL 
DOCTOR YOU IMPUGN MY HONOUR 
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T SAY BELITTLE COS I'D HAVE HAD A FIELD DAY 
FORTUNATELY WE GOT TO CAST CHRIS RYAN WHO IS FIVE FOOT TALL AND IS A FABULOUS ACTOR 
THE PLANET IS GOING NUCLEAR I ADMIRE THEM THE BRAVERY OF IDIOTS IS BRAVERY NONETHELESS 
MY BODY HEAD ARMS EVERYTHING WAS CAST IN SOME SORT OF MATERIAL 
TO CREATE A NEW BODY A SONTARAN BODY 
HE'S LITERALLY LIKE A STATUE HE'S ENCASED COVERED IN PLASTER 
A CAST HAD TO BE TAKEN OF THE WHOLE BODY 
THE ARMS THE HANDS 
BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME FOR THESE THINGS TO SET YOU HAVE TO KEEP AS STILL AS POSSIBLE 
IT'S AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE AT BEST HE'S GOT TO STAND STILL FOR ABOUT AN HOUR 
I HAD MY HANDS HELD ONTO A BAR AT THE FRONT STOOD IN POSITION FEET APART 
ONCE THAT'S ALL SET WE CAN CRACK IT OPEN AND OPEN UP THE BODY MOULD 
ONCE THAT'S ALL SET WE CAN CRACK IT OPEN AND OPEN UP THE BODY MOULD 
THEN WE FILL IT UP WITH FIBREGLASS 
AND CASTING MATERIALS AND THAT GIVES US OUR COPY OF CHRIS 
WE DECIDED TO BUILD EVERYTHING AROUND CHRIS 
AND THEN TRY TO FIT OTHER PEOPLE TO EFFECTIVELY HIS COSTUME 
I THINK THAT THE ARMOUR THE SONTARANS HAVE IS A COUSIN OF THE ARMOUR THEY HAD BEFORE 
THEY USED TO BE PADDED AND WE WANTED SOMETHING THAT WAS MORE ARMOUR LIKE 
JUST STRONGER THEY WEAR METAL SHELLS BECAUSE THEY'RE SOLDIERS 
IT'S NO SMALL TASK TRANSFORMING THESE FIVE FOOT PERFORMERS INTO AN ARMED FORCE 
EARLY IN THE MORNING THE CAST ARRIVE TO GET AHEAD WITH THEIR COSTUME 
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WE WILL GET OUR 
OUR FACES GLUED ON FOR ANOTHER THREE HOURS MAKE UP AND HEADS 
THAT'LL NICE THREE HOURS AND THEN WE START 
IT WILL BE QUITE A LONG DAY I THINK YES THERE'S A LOT TO DO 
HIYA 
HIYA 
DAN DEBBIE WE'VE GOT YOUR CONFIDENTIAL 
IT WAS FUN IT WAS BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE 
BECAUSE PHYSICALLY WE FELT QUITE CONSTRAINED 
FIRST OF ALL YOU'VE GOT THESE BIG ARM SECTIONS HERE 
WHICH ARE MADE OF FOAM SEWN ON TO A LYCRA SLEEVE 
FIRST OF ALL IT'S A SLIGHTLY SNUG FIT SO YOU HAVE TO 
FORCE YOUR ARM DOWN INTO IT AND ALSO YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THESE ON 
BEFORE THEY PUT ON THE PROSTHETIC HEAD BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PUT THE HEAD ON AND THEN PUT THE ARMS ON 
THIS IS THE FIRST STAGE WHICH GIVES YOU THIS WONDERFUL AMERICAN FOOTBALLER LOOK 
WE FORGET WE'VE GOT THIS THING ON BECAUSE THE WORK IS SO INTENSE 
JUST TRYING TO REMEMBER WHERE YOU ARE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO SAY 
YOU FORGET HOW EXTRAORDINARY THESE CHARACTERS APPEAR 
SO PEOPLE DO GIVE YOU VERY STRANGE LOOKS AND YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY 
YOU GET TO FEEL VERY PARANOID ACTUALLY 
THERE'S A LOT TO BE DONE 
IT WILL TAKE THE BEST PART OF THREE HOURS ISN'T THAT RIGHT YEAH TWO AND A HALF TO THREE HOURS 
ALTOGETHER BEFORE WE EVEN SEE THE SET 
THE FIRST THING WE PUT ON IS THE BALD CAP HERE TO KEEP THE HAIR OUT OF THE WAY 
THAT IS THE HEADPIECE THAT JUST GOES ON 
THERE YOU ARE 
YOU'RE IN 
ONCE THIS IS ON THE HEARING IS DEADENED QUITE A LOT 
AND THEN WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE SCENES WITH THE HELMETS ON IT'S EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO HEAR 
WE MAKE ONE FACE FOR EACH DAY 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY 
WE MADE EIGHT FOR DAN AND SIX OR SEVEN FOR CHRIS 
O. O. O. O. O. O. O. OH 
YEAH 
RIGHT I'M ALL PROSTHETICKED UP APART FROM MY GLOVES AND MY COLLAR 
I'M JUST GOING TO NIP BACK TO MY TRAILER PUT MY PARAPHERNALIA THERE THEN I'LL BE CALLED TO SET 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE 
PREPARE WEAPONS 
MEETING SOMEONE LIKE YOU 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE 
WIPE THEM OUT GO AGAIN OH MAN THIS IS WAR 
LIKE YOU 
OH 
OH THAT'S GOOD STUFF 
EVEN SONTARANS LIKE HAVING THEIR MAKE UP DONE SOMETIMES 
YOU CAN'T PUT BEAUTY SECOND COS YOU'RE TAKING OVER THE PLANET 
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WEAPONS 
SONTAR HA 
SONTAR HA 
ALL SONTAR HA 
WE WANT TO GIVE THEM THAT TESTOSTERONE 
SONTAR HA SONTAR HA SONTAR HA 
SONTAR HA 
THEY JUST NEEDED THAT RELEASE THAT JOY IN BATTLE BEYOND JUST SAYING I'M HAVING FUN 
I THOUGHT THAT CHANT BROUGHT OUT THEIR AGGRESSION AND THEIR RITUALS AND ALSO THEIR FUN 
BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ALL OF ONE LIKE MIND THEY ARE CLONES 
THEY DO THINGS TOGETHER THEY ALL JOIN IN EXACTLY THE SAME ACTIONS AND WORDS 
IT JUST SEEMS REALLY SONTARAN TO DO THAT 
ABOUT THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO WHEN THE GUYS FIRST CAME TOGETHER 
WE DID A FEW BASIC EXERCISES JUST RUNNING THINGS 
JUST SOME MARCHING 
TO GET EVERYBODY IN THE FEEL OF THE QUALITY OF MOVEMENT THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR 
D. CAMERA 
O. K. AND 
THREE TWO ONE ACTION 
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WEAPONS 
SONTAR HA 
SONTAR HA 
I SEEM TO REMEMBER SAYING THAT QUITE A FEW TIMES 
SONTAR HA SONTAR HA SONTAR HA 
SONTAR HA 
MY LEFT PALM WAS VERY SORE 
SONTAR HA SONTAR HA SONTAR HA 
SONTAR HA 
GIMME A BREAK 
WE'RE SETTING UP THE FINAL SCENE OF THE DAY WHERE THE SONTARANS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY NICKED THE TARDIS 
SO A WALL IS BEING TAKEN DOWN IN THAT SET 
I'LL GO AND HAVE A LIE DOWN IN MY WINNEBAGO 
WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA 
SO THEY CAN BRING THE TARDIS IN IT'S RATHER BIG 
QUICK SOMEBODY MOVE IT OFF THE BENCH 
BLOOMIN' ECK IT'S EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTEEN 
AND I'M DRINKING CUP A SOUP THROUGH A STRAW AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE WRAP QUITE SOON 
THE SPOILS OF WAR THE DOCTOR'S INFAMOUS VESSEL IN SONTARAN HANDS 
IT'S TELLING ME TO MOVE SIR 
I HAVE SOLDIERS OF MY OWN 
I WILL TELL THEM OF THE HONOUR AND THE GLORY SIR 
IT'S FUNNY THERE IS SOMETHING INNATELY SLIGHTLY SINISTER ABOUT A CHILD GENIUS 
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T QUITE FIT WITH THE NATURAL WAY OF THINGS 
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE THE DOCTOR HELLO YOUR COMMANDING OFFICER PHONED AHEAD 
BUT I HAVEN'T GOT A COMMANDING OFFICER HAVE YOU 
IT'S KIND OF A BIT OF A DREAM ROLE TO PLAY 
BECAUSE HE'S GOT ALL THESE GREAT ELEMENTS 
LIKE GENIUS AND MEGALOMANIAC 
COOL 
HE'S A CHARACTER WHO HAS JUST SOMEWHERE GONE OFF THE RAILS 
HE'S BRILLIANT HE'S INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT 
BUT HE'S CAST HIMSELF AS AN OUTSIDER 
ALL OUR LIVES EXCLUDED THE CLEVER ONES 
HE SEES HIMSELF AS A KIND OF SAVIOUR 
I THINK HE'S QUITE EMBITTERED 
AND HE'S TRYING TO SAVE THIS GROUP OF STUDENTS AND HE FEELS LIKE HE CAN GIVE THEM 
THE NEW WORLD THAT THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO CREATE 
HE'S A LOST LITTLE BOY REALLY A GENIUS WHO'S NEVER HAD A FRIEND 
I DON'T THINK HE'S EVEN GOT A FAMILY 
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY VERY LONELY ABOUT THAT BOY AND IT'S SO CHILDISH THE WAY THAT HIS LONELINESS 
HAS COME OUT HIS AGGRESSION AND MEGALOMANIA AND AMBITION 
RIDICULOUS PLANS TO MOVE TO ANOTHER PLANET 
THERE WAS NO PLANET FALL CASTOR THIRTY SIX INDEED 
WE ONLY NEEDED YOU FOR INSTALLATION OF THE ATMOS SYSTEM 
NO BUT I'M ON YOUR SIDE I DID EVERYTHING YOU WANTED 
HE'S A BIT OF AN ANTI DOCTOR HE IS SOMEONE WHO 
THE DOCTOR RECOGNISES SOMEONE VERY SIMILAR IN LUKE RATTIGAN TO HIMSELF 
IT'S NOT EASY IS IT BEING CLEVER 
YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD AND YOU CONNECT THINGS RANDOM THINGS 
AND YOU THINK WHY CAN'T ANYONE ELSE SEE IT 
THE REST OF THE WORLD IS SO SLOW 
YEAH YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN 
I KNOW 
HE'S QUITE KEEN TO BRING LUKE DOWN A PEG OR TWO FROM THE START 
BECAUSE HE KNOW THINGS ARE SPIRALLING OUT OF CONTROL 
INVENTING ZERO CARBON CARS 
SAVING THE WORLD 
IT TAKES A MAN WITH VISION MM BLINKERED VISION 
IT'S OFTEN GOOD WITH A GREAT BIG ALIEN RACE TO GIVE THEM A HUMAN ALLY 
SOMEONE TO REFLECT OFF BOUNCE WITH 
SOMEONE WHO CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM THAT THE DOCTOR CAN'T HAVE 
THE DOCTOR JUST OPPOSES THEM AND TRIES TO STOP THEM 
THROUGH LUKE WE GET TO KNOW THE SONTARANS 
GLORIOUS WARFARE 
TENTH SONTARAN BATTLE FLEET WE MOVE TO THE FINAL PHASE 
PREPARE THE SUBJUGATION OF EARTH FOR THE GLORY OF SONTAR 
FROM THE START OF EPISODE FIVE WHERE WE LEAVE IN EPISODE FOUR AND CONTINUE IN EPISODE FIVE 
WE FIND THE WHOLE WORLD CHOKING ON SONTAR GAS THAT'S BEEN ACTIVATED 
ALL SOLDIERS TO WITHDRAW 
MCCLUSKEY TAKE THE SOLDIERS INTO THE FACTORY 
MAKE THE AREA SECURE SEAL UP ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS 
ONCE I'D GOT THE IDEA OF THE CARS BEING THE PRINCIPAL THREAT THAT THE SONTARANS USED 
IT SEEMED OBVIOUS THAT WHAT WE WANTED TO USE WAS AN ALIEN TOXIC FORM OF EXHAUST FUMES 
IT WAS VERY EXCITING WRITING TWO SCRIPTS WITH HUGE LAVISH DESCRIPTIONS 
OF ALIEN GAS BELCHING OUT OF THE BACK OF CARS AND ENVELOPING TOWNS AND CHOKING PEOPLE ETC 
A FOGGY DAY 
IN LONDON TOWN 
I HAD ME LOW 
I HAD ME DOWN 
I VIEWED THE MORNING 
WITH SUCH ALARM 
THE BRITISH MUSEUM 
HAD LOST ITS CHARM 
FILMING WITH SMOKE IS AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE 
BECAUSE IT IS THE ELEMENT IN SPECIAL EFFECTS 
THAT IS MOST AT THE MERCY OF THE ELEMENTS 
MORE SMOKE MORE SMOKE OVER HERE I'M HEARING MORE SMOKE FROM DOUGLAS 
IT TOOK US BY SURPRISE THE SMOKE BECAUSE ACTUALLY WE SET ASIDE A FAIR BIT OF C. G. I. MONEY 
TO CREATE THE SMOKE THAT WE NEVER SPENT BECAUSE THE EFFECTS GUYS 
DANNY AND HIS TEAM CREATED THIS EFFECT SO BRILLIANTLY 
I NEVER THOUGHT IT'D BE THAT SIMPLE 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SMOKE IT DEPENDS ON THE SCENE 
IF IT IS A BIG SHOT WE HAVE THESE BIG CELLOPHANE TUBES WHICH PUMP STUFF OUT 
FOR CLOSE UPS WE HAVE JUST LITTLE SMOKE GUNS 
WHICH PUMP OUT SOMETHING MORE AKIN TO STANDARD DRY ICE 
THESE ARE THE SMALLER MACHINES WE'VE GOT 
IT'S HEATED BY GAS 
WHICH TRAVELS DOWN THE MIDDLE OF A COPPER COIL 
THE FLUID TRAVELS DOWN THROUGH THE COPPER COIL VAPORISES 
IT MEANS WE CAN FILL A LARGE AREA WITH SMOKE 
WE HAVE A LARGE MACHINE CALLED A MEDIUM WHICH IS MORE STATIC 
ALSO OUR LAY FLAT THE TUBING THAT WE RUN OUT 
SO ONE MAN CAN COVER A HUGE AREA OF SMOKE 
I WAS MUCH MORE FEARFUL ACTUALLY AS A SUCCESSFUL ELEMENT IN THIS 
ABOUT SMOKE THAN I WOULD BE ABOUT FIRE SNOW OR RAIN OR ANYTHING 
BECAUSE THE WIND BLOWS AND YOU HAVE TO RE ROUTE IT ALL THE OTHER WAY 
IT'S REALLY TRICKY TO GET RIGHT AND ALSO IT CHANGES THE WHOLE TIME 
NOT FOR ONE SECOND DOES IT STAY THE SAME CONTINUITY IS A NIGHTMARE 
IF THE WIND STARTS TO GUST UP THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WE CAN DO 
AND IT'S NOT THE MOST PLEASANT THING 
A FOGGY DAY 
IN LONDON TOWN 
I HAD ME LOW 
I HAD ME DOWN 
I VIEWED THE MORNING 
WITH SUCH ALARM 
THE OLD BRITISH MUSEUM WAFT DAN WAFT 
HAD LOST ITS CHARM 
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY CAUSING ME I HOPE IT'S NOT CAUSING ME ANY HARM 
UM ER CUT BACK TO ME NEXT YEAR WITH AN IRON LUNG 
NOW WALK BACK INTO THE CORNER 
AS SONTARAN SMOKE CHOKES THE EARTH THE MOST UNLIKELY HERO APPEARS THROUGH THE MIST 
HE'S GONNA CHOKE DOCTOR 
IT WON'T OPEN 
WELL DON'T JUST STAND THERE GET HIM OUT 
YET AGAIN THE MUM SOLVES EVERYTHING 
THE MEN ARE RUNNING ABOUT PANICKING MUM COMES IN WITH AN AXE 
SO IT'LL BE THAT ANGLE IS THAT O. K. THAT'S O. K. YUP 
THAT AND THERE DE DUH DE DUH 
LOVELY 
SHE KEEPS AN AXE BY THE FRONT DOOR IN CASE OF BURGLARS SHE'D ATTACK BURGLARS WITH AN AXE 
NO NONSENSE SYLVIA STRAIGHT TO THE RESCUE 
WELL DON'T JUST STAND THERE GET HIM OUT 
SYLVIA BECOMES THE HERO IN THAT MOMENT BUT THEN THAT IS PART OF WHAT DOCTOR WHO DOES 
IT MAKES HEROES OUT OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE IT'S PART OF WHAT THE DOCTOR DOES 
HE'S AN ENABLER HE BRINGS OUT THE EXTRAORDINARY IN PEOPLE 
PARTLY BECAUSE HE PUTS THEM IN SITUATIONS 
WHERE THEY'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE AND IT'S SINK OR SWIM 
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH SYLVIA 
WE'VE HAD SYLVIA COME AND AXE THE CAR 
ACTION 
I HAD TO DO THIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED TECHNICALLY BUT YOU SWING AND STOP AT THAT POINT 
WELL DON'T JUST STAND THERE GET HIM OUT 
WE'RE SEEING FOR REAL WITH THE WINDSCREEN IN 
SYLVIA THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN WITH A RUBBER AXE 
AND A REVERSE AT THE WHEEL IN THE CAR 
THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS OUT PUT SOME SILICON GLASS THERE 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S SITTING THERE WITH A LOAD OF SHATTERED GLASS ROUND THERE 
THEN WE'RE GOING TO GET A PIECE OF DECK GLASS AND SHOOT THROUGH THAT THE ACTUAL MOMENT OF IMPACT 
SO ACTUALLY WE'VE NEVER HAD TO DO ANYTHING IN THE CAR OTHER THAN TAKE THE WINDSCREEN OUT 
SADLY THEY WOULDN'T LET ME DO IT 
BUT I SO WANTED TO 
I TOLD EVERYONE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FORTUNE IN PSYCHOTHERAPY TO JUST BE ABLE TO SMASH A WINDSCREEN 
TWO STUNT PEOPLE HAD TO COME IN AND COVER FOR ME 
CLEAR IT KEEP IT CLEAR TURN OVER QUIET NOW 
ONE BEING THE PRODUCER FAIR ENOUGH 
SHE'S A VERY ATTRACTIVE LADY I WAS THRILLED THREE TWO ONE 
THE OTHER ONE DANNY 
I'M SORRY A MAN REPLACING ME 
AND HE HAD SMALLER HANDS THAN ME WHICH IS ALSO UPSETTING 
AH THE THINGS I DO FOR DOCTOR WHO HONESTLY 
SO I JUST GOT TO WATCH 
CHECK THE SIZE OF YOUR HANDS I'D BE INSULTED IF I WERE YOU 
DANNY AND I JUST SET THAT UP AS A SECOND UNIT CAMERA LOCK OFF 
IT WAS A PROPER PIECE OF GLASS THE CAMERA LOCKED OFF BEHIND IT 
AND I THINK WE GOT DANNY IN SYLVIA'S THING WITH HIS HAIRY ARMS TO WHACK IT 
THANK YOU O. K. NOW GUYS 
SMOKE UP 
DANNY YOU READY YES THANKS 
WE'RE AT SPEED BOYS 
IT'S GOING TO MAKE A LOUD BANG O. K. STEP AWAY 
HERE WE GO AND THREE TWO ONE HANG ON LET'S NOT RUSH IT 
BIT MORE SMOKE IN THAT SIDE THEN 
O. K. FORGET IT THEN 
AND 
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST ONE YES THIS IS THE ONE YEAH READY SET O. K. 
THREE TWO ONE 
WELL DONE 
O. K. CAN I HAVE HIM BACK INSIDE PLEASE 
WENT WELL MY COLLEAGUE FIRED AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME SO EVERYONE WAS SAFE 
IT'S BETTER FOR ME TO DO IT THAN ANYONE ELSE THAT'S THE REASON I'M DRESSED LIKE THIS 
GREAT 
I COULD HAVE DONE A BIGGER SWING 
WELL DON'T JUST STAND THERE GET HIM OUT 
IT'S A GOOD CHANCE WHEN WE COME BACK TO EARTH MID SERIES 
IT IS A GOOD CHANCE FOR THE COMPANION TO DEVELOP 
FOR EXAMPLE DONNA GETS HER KEY TO THE TARDIS 
OH I'VE NEVER GIVEN YOU A KEY 
KEEP THAT THAT'S YOURS QUITE A BIG MOMENT 
SHE'S GIVEN A KEY TO THE TARDIS YEAH 
WHICH IN TRUE DONNA FASHION SHE GOES YEAH NEVER MIND DON'T GET ALL SENTIMENTAL 
COS I'M CHOKING TO DEATH 
ACTION 
LOOK AFTER YOURSELF GET YOURSELF IN THE BUILDING 
WHAT'S PERHAPS DIFFERENT TO THE DOCTOR AND DONNA'S RELATIONSHIP 
TO RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE'VE SEEN THE DOCTOR HAVE BEFORE 
IS THAT DONNA HERSELF FEELS NO NEED TO PROVE HERSELF 
GOD THIS AIR'S DISGUSTING IT LOOKS BAD GET IN THE TARDIS 
OH I'VE NEVER GIVEN YOU A KEY 
SHE'S VERY MUCH HER OWN WOMAN 
AND I THINK THE DOCTOR THEREFORE GOES ALONG WITH THAT 
KEEP THAT THAT'S YOURS' 
QUITE A BIG MOMENT REALLY 
YEAH MAYBE WE'LL GET SENTIMENTAL AFTER THE WORLD'S FINISHED CHOKING TO DEATH YEAH GOOD IDEA 
DONNA'S NOT BEEN WAITING GOING OH YOU KNOW ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME THE ALARM CODE 
I DON'T THINK SHE'S REALLY READING INTO THAT IN ANY WAY 
DONNA JUST FORCES HERSELF UPON HIM 
AND INHABITS THE DOCTOR'S LIFE FROM THE MOMENT SHE STEPS ON BOARD 
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M DOING THIS 
NO NEITHER CAN I 
FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE DOCTOR GIVES HER A TARDIS KEY 
I THINK HE ASSUMED HE'D ALREADY DONE IT 
SHE TREATS IT IN A MUCH MORE CAVALIER WAY THAN EITHER ROSE OR MARTHA DID 
NONE OF THAT THE WORLD'S CHOKING TO DEATH 
WITH ROSE AND POSSIBLY EVEN MORE WITH MARTHA THERE WAS A SENSE THAT PERHAPS THEY FELT 
THEY DIDN'T QUITE DESERVE TO BE THERE 
WHAT'S HAPPENED WHERE ARE YOU 
STILL ON EARTH BUT DON'T WORRY I'VE GOT MY SECRET WEAPON 
WHAT'S THAT YOU SOMEHOW THAT'S NOT MAKING ME HAPPY 
COMPANION ALONE ON AN ALIEN SPACESHIP AND ALL SHE'S GOT IS A HAMMER 
IT'S LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY DREADFUL ABOUT THAT 
GENUINELY FULL OF DREAD IN THAT THE DOCTOR ISN'T THERE AND HE ISN'T THERE TO SAVE HER 
IT'S A SCARY PLACE TO BE IT'S VERY ALONE 
I FIND THAT VERY VERY SCARY IT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SEQUENCES BECAUSE OF THE LONELINESS OF IT 
THERE'S A SONTORAN SONT A RAN DID HE SEE YOU NO HE'S GOT HIS BACK TO ME 
LISTEN ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK 
ON HIS COLLAR THERE'S A PLUG A HOLE THE PROBIC VENT ONE BLOW TO THE PROBIC VENT 
KNOCKS HIM OUT BUT HE'S GOING TO KILL ME I'M SORRY I SWEAR I'M SO SORRY BUT YOU'VE GOT TO TRY 
SHE DOES HAVE A WOBBLE AND THAT'S QUITE UNUSUAL 
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THAT FROM HER BECAUSE SHE IS QUITE SURE OF WHO SHE IS 
OF WHAT SHE CAN DO AND WHAT SHE CAN'T DO 
BUT I CAN'T EVEN MEND A FUSE DONNA STOP TALKING LIKE THAT YOU CAN DO THIS I PROMISE 
WHEN THE DOCTOR REALLY HAS TO PUSH HER IT FEELS 
NEW AND HE'S SORRY FOR IT 
BUT WHAT IF THEY FIND ME 
I KNOW I WOULDN'T ASK BUT THERE'S NOTHING ELSE I CAN DO 
THE PLANET'S CHOKING DONNA 
THE DOCTOR ALMOST REGRETS HAVING TO PUSH HER INTO SITUATIONS 
WHERE SHE WOULDN'T FEEL ENTIRELY COMFORTABLE 
BUT OF COURSE HE DOES BECAUSE HE HAS TO AND OF COURSE SHE FULFILS IT BECAUSE SHE IS 
PERHAPS MORE ABLE THAN SHE BELIEVES HERSELF TO BE 
SHE RISES TO THE OCCASION SHE DOES 
AND I THINK SHE SORT OF FINDS THIS STRENGTH WITHIN HER AND I DON'T KNOW IF SHE KNEW SHE HAD IT 
BECAUSE SHE'S COCKY AND MOUTHY AND BALLSY 
BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN SHE'S BRAVE IN THE FACE OF ALIEN WARFARE 
BUT IT TURNS OUT SHE IS 
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY HUMAN ABOUT THAT 
SHE DOESN'T SUDDENLY BECOME SOME SUPERHERO AND STEP UP TO THE MARK IN A WAY THAT'S JUST TOO MUCH 
AND ACTION 
BACK OF THE NECK 
HERE'S A BIT OF TRIVIA FOR YOU IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SHOE 
BUT BECAUSE I ONLY WEAR TRAINERS THEY DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE A TRAINER 
OR THOUGHT PROBABLY A TRAINER WOULD JUST BOUNCE OFF THE BACK OF HIS NECK 
SO I HAD TO HAVE A MALLET 
I'M THROUGH OH YOU ARE BRILLIANT YOU ARE 
SHUT UP 
PREVIOUSLY HE'S BEEN MORE USED TO BEING ADMIRED AND SLIGHTLY GOGGLED AT 
WITH VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STORY DONNA BECOMES MORE OF THE COMPANION 
THERE'S SOME REALLY BRILLIANT STUFF TO COME 
IT'S PART OF THE NEW THE DIFFERENT FLAVOUR THAT DONNA BRINGS 
HELLO 
DOCTOR 
I WALKED OUT COS I HAD SOME PLANS 
YEAH I WALKED OUT 
DESTINY IN MY OWN HANDS 
I THOUGHT I'D GET BY WITHOUT YOU 
THOUGHT I'D SURVIVE WITHOUT YOU 
DONNA NOBLE SINCE YOU DIDN'T ASK 
I'LL HAVE A SALUTE 
MA'AM THANK YOU 
COS I CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU 
I CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU 
I CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU 
NO SOMETHING IS WRONG 
I CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU 
COME ON 
SO I PICKED FIGHTS WITH MEN TWICE MY SIZE 
AND YOU'RE WOULD BE THE DOCTOR AND DONNA NOBLE 
REPRESENTING THE NOBLE CORPORATION P. L. C. LIMITED INTERGALACTIC 
IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS WITH YOU INNIT OH YES AND OFF WE GO 
CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU 
I CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU 
I CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU GIRL 
BELIEVE ME BABY 
CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU CAN'T GET ALONG 
I CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU CAN'T GET ALONG 
I CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU 
NO SOMETHING IS WRONG 
I CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU 
I REALLY NEED YOU BABY 
WE WANTED A GREAT BIG EXPLOSIVE ENDING 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE SONTARANS ARE YOU LIVE BY WAR YOU DIE BY WAR 
SO WITH ALL THEIR GUNS AND ARMOUR AND ATTITUDE 
THEY JUST DESERVE TO BE BLOWN OUT THE SKY FRANKLY 
JUST SEND THAT THING UP ON ITS OWN I DON'T KNOW 
PUT IT ON A DELAY 
I CAN'T 
WHY NOT 
I'VE GOT TO GIVE THEM A CHOICE 
TO STOP THE SONTARANS IN THE END HE HAS TO THREATEN THEM WITH EXTINCTION 
BUT OF COURSE BECAUSE HE'S THE DOCTOR HE HAS TO GIVE THEM THE CHOICE 
ACTION OH EXCELLENT 
GENERAL STAR YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS 
THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION 
YOU CAN LEAVE JUST GO 
SONTARAN HIGH COMMAND NEED NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE 
YOUR STRATAGEM WOULD BE WISE IF SONTARANS FEARED DEATH BUT WE DO NOT AT ARMS 
I'M GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO LEAVE 
AS HE BEAMS UP TO THAT SHIP HE KNOWS IT'S A KIND OF SUICIDE 
IT'S PUTTING A MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR AND GIVING HIM THE BUTTON THAT WILL STOP THE WAR 
BUT THE ONE MAN WHO WON'T PRESS IT 
AND I JUST LOVE THAT DILEMMA WOULD HE HAVE DONE IT 
COULD HE HAVE DONE IT I'M GLAD WE'LL NEVER KNOW 
THE BLESSING OF THE DOCTOR IS THAT HE MADE LUKE SEE THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER CHOICE 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING SOMETHING CLEVER 
IN THAT ONE MOMENT OF SELF SACRIFICE AT THE END HE GETS THE CHANCE TO REDEEM HIMSELF 
HE IS NOT THE BAD GUY HE MAKES A BOLD MOVE AND MARTYRS HIMSELF 
FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORLD BECAUSE HE JUST NEEDS TO SOMETHING JUST CLICKS INSIDE HIM 
AND ACTUALLY BY COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THE DOCTOR 
HE MATURES INTO HIS PROPER INTELLIGENCE AND SAVES THE DAY IN THE END
