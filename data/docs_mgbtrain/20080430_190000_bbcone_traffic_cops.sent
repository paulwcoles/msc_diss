LIKE THIS FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY IN HULL 
HE'S RECOVERED HIMSELF NOW 
ON THE RUN FROM THE COPS IN A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY M. P. H. JAGUAR X. J. S. 
HE'S GONE LEFT DOWN THE CYCLE TRACK NARROWLY MISSING A GROUP OF PEDESTRIANS 
A CAR WEIGHING A TONNE PLUS TRAVELLING AT EIGHTY NINETY M. P. H. IS A VERY SERIOUS WEAPON 
ESPECIALLY BEING DRIVEN BY A JUVENILE MALE 
YES HE'S ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS CONTRAVENING RED LIGHTS AT 
IN HULL IN EAST YORKSHIRE SOMEONE'S FOURTEEN YEAR OLD IS STILL RUNNING AMOK 
WRONG SIDE OF THE LIGHTS STILL HEADING TOWARDS THE CITY 
THE TEENAGER'S STOLEN THE JAG FOR FUN HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT PUTTING BYSTANDERS LIVES IN DANGER 
HE'S GONE RIGHT RIGHT AT BRISBANE STREET 
BUT A SCHOOLBOY DRIVING A THREE HUNDRED HORSE POWER JAG IS NO JOKE 
THERE WERE PEDESTRIANS HAVING TO JUMP OUT OF THE WAY 
OF THIS LUNATIC IN THE VEHICLE AT HIGH SPEED 
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE COULDN'T CONTROL IT 
HE'S GOING LEFT LEFT TOWARDS THE ROUNDABOUT 
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS FOR TRAFFIC COPS ON THE GROUND TO CHASE THE CAR 
THEY'VE BEEN ORDERED TO LEAVE IT TO OSCAR NINETY NINE THE POLICE HELICOPTER 
THE PRESENCE OF AIRCRAFT MEANT THE PURSUING VEHICLES COULD DROP BACK TO EASE PRESSURE ON THE DRIVER 
OSCAR NINETY NINE HE'S ON HESSLE ROAD NOW 
HE'S JUST PASSING THE NEW ASDA 
THE DRIVER DOESN'T KNOW THE POLICE CHOPPER IS ABOVE HIM 
HE'S GOT NO FEAR OF BEING CAUGHT AND NO FEAR OF DANGER 
NINETY NINE HE'S ON THE PAVEMENT ACROSS ONTO SAINT GEORGE'S 
NARROWLY MISSING SEVERAL VEHICLES SAINT GEORGE'S NOW 
NINETY NINE HE'S ON SAINT GEORGE'S OVERTAKING VEHICLES INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC 
HE'S APPROACHING THE JUNCTION NOW STAND BY 
NINETY NINE IT'S RIGHT RIGHT BACK TOWARDS THE FLYOVER 
NINETY NINE HE'S COLLIDED WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE 
ARTHUR STREET 
NINETY NINE HE'S NOW ON THE PAVEMENT TO AVOID BEING TRAPPED BY CARS 
HE'S UP TOWARDS ANLABY ROAD ON THE PAVEMENT 
TO SEE HIM DRIVING DOWN A FOOTPATH YOU REALISE HOW MUCH DANGER THE PUBLIC ARE IN 
WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS VEHICLE STOPPED AND THE DRIVER ARRESTED 
THE ONLY WAY WILL BE TO PUNCTURE HIS TYRES WITH A STINGER BEFORE HE CRASHES 
KEEP THE AIRWAYS CLEAR PLEASE I APPRECIATE YOUR MESSAGE 
BUT IT'S TOO LATE 
NINETY NINE HE'S CRASHED HE'S CRASHED AT THE TOP OF WALTON STREET ON THE LEVEL CROSSING 
HE'S REACHED THE END OF THE LINE HE'S ON THE RAILWAY TRACKS 
AND THAT'S NOT ALL 
THE TRACKS ARE DOWN FOR A TRAIN TO APPROACH 
WE DECIDED THAT WE'D BETTER TRY AND STOP THE TRAIN 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE WE ARE INFORMING RAILTRACK AS A MATTER OF URGENCY 
THERE ARE VEHICLES AT THE SCENE BY THE LOOKS OF IT 
SO WE FLEW OVER TO THE TRAIN AS IT WAS APPROACHING 
AND THE PILOT WENT DOWN LOW 
MY COLLEAGUE IN THE REAR INDICATED TO THE TRAIN TO STOP 
THE THING WE DIDN'T KNOW WAS THE JAGUAR WAS LEAKING FUEL ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING 
YET THOSE TWO OFFICERS STILL RAN OUT AND ENDANGERED THEMSELVES TO SAVE THAT YOUNG LAD 
THESE DAYS CHASING KIDS IN CARS IS NOT APPROVED OF 
EVEN THOUGH STOLEN VEHICLES OR SMVS DRIVEN BY YOUNGSTERS ARE ALL TOO COMMON 
THERE'S AN SMV ON THE MOVE 
WE'RE LOOKING AT A. 
A GREEN NISSAN MICRA 
HERE IN GRIMSBY WHEN THE SCHOOLS ARE OUT SOME KIDS TAKE UP DRIVING 
IN EASY TO NICK NISSAN MICRAS 
THERE'S NO IMMOBILISER ON OLDER MODELS 
AT THAT TIME THE CAR OF CHOICE FOR THE YOUNG TWOCKERS 
WAS THE NISSAN MICRA 
REGISTRATION 
A COUPLE OF OBSERVATION MESSAGES 
POSTED FOR A NISSAN MICRA BEING DRIVEN AROUND THE ESTATE 
POSSIBLY A STOLEN VEHICLE DUE TO ONE OF ITS WINDOWS BEING MISSING 
LET'S HAVE A FLICK ROUND THE ESTATES 
FIREBLADE YEAH WHAT'S THAT DOING UP THIS NECK OF THE WOODS 
A SPEEDING MOTORBIKE A HONDA FIREBLADE HAS INTERRUPTED THEIR SEARCH FOR THE MICRA 
SPIN IT ON THE DATABASE IT'S AN OLD UN IN'T IT 
COULD I HAVE A VEHICLE CHECK PLEASE CAMBRIDGE ROAD GRIMSBY 
I RECOGNISE THAT TATTOO ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK 
P. C. WOOD THINKS HE KNOWS WHO THE RIDER IS 
IF HE COULD JUST GET A CLOSER LOOK AT HIS TATTOO 
WHERE'S HE FROM 
IT'S A CASE OF NOW YOU SEE IT HE FAILED TO STOP 
NOW YOU DON'T 
MALE DRIVER WITH A DISTINCT TATTOO ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK 
THERE'S NO CHANCE OF CATCHING THE BIKER 
IT WAS A HONDA FIREBLADE IN WHITE AND BLUE 
LIKE UNDERAGE KIDS IN CARS 
MOTORBIKE RIDERS WHO DON'T WANT TO STOP ARE ALSO OFF LIMITS TO PURSUING TRAFFIC COPS 
WE ARE REALLY KNACKERED ON THE PURSUIT POLICY 
SO NO 
ONCE A MOTORCYCLE FAILS TO STOP AND INDICATES IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP 
AND THAT OBVIOUSLY WAS GOING AT SEVENTY M. P. H. IN THE THIRTY LIMIT GOING ON THE OUTSIDE 
THAT IS IT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO STOP PULL OVER STOP AND PASS IT OUT AS OBSERVATIONS 
SEE IF SOMEONE CATCHES IT WHILE ITS STATIONARY BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS 
I THINK ON A FIREBLADE BY NOW HE'D GOT A FOUR MILE START ON US 
EIGHT MILES OUT BY NOW 
NINE HUNDRED C. C. BIKE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ODD HORSE POWER 
UNLESS IT'S A TWO HUNDRED HORSE POWER REVOLVER NO CHANCE 
CHASING BIKERS AROUND ESTATES AT HIGH SPEED IS ASKING FOR TROUBLE 
BUT LETTING THEM GO IS STILL FRUSTRATING FOR THE COPS 
ONE IN THE CELLS MAKES MY DAY 
A PURSUIT AND NOBODY AT THE END OF IT RANKLES 
YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE WITH IT IF YOU ALLOW IT TO RANKLE TOO MUCH YOU WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS JOB FOR LONG 
N. NOVEMBER F. FOXTROT U. UNIFORM 
IT'S JUST GONE ON TO SHELLEY AVENUE 
MAYBE THERE'S A CHANCE TO IRON OUT THE RANKLES 
THE STOLEN NISSAN MICRA HAS JUST BEEN SEEN AGAIN 
THE DRIVER LOOKS TO BE UNDERAGE 
THE DECISION TO GO AFTER YOUNG CAR THIEVES OR NOT IS DOWN TO THE INSPECTOR IN THE CONTROL ROOM 
WHO HAS TO WEIGH UP THE RISKS INVOLVED 
IT WAS HALF TERM HOLIDAYS WE WERE LOOKING AT HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE ON THE STREET ARE KIDS PLAYING 
THE AGGRAVATING FACTOR IS IF THE VEHICLE SHOULD FAIL TO STOP HOW CAN WE STOP IT SAFELY AND QUICKLY 
GO STATIC HERE SEE IF IT COMES PAST 
WE WERE ASKED TO COVER THE JUNCTION AT MILTON ROAD AND SUTCLIFFE AVENUE 
YOU CAN HEAR BY RADIO WHERE IT'S GOING IF IT'S GOING TO COME IN YOUR DIRECTION 
SHE'LL LOSE IT ON THERE SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE GRASS 
TANGO ONE TO ZERO DUE TO THE AGE OF THE DRIVER OF THE CAR BEING VERY YOUNG 
THE PURSUIT IS NOT 
THE PURSUIT IS NOT AUTHORISED THE PURSUIT IS NOT AUTHORISED 
OUT WITH STINGER JUST ON THE OFF CHANCE 
IT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY WHY THE SUPERVISOR ABORTED AT THAT POINT 
THE AGE OF THE DRIVER IS WITHOUT DOUBT AN AGGRAVATING FACTOR THAT HE OR SHE WOULD'VE CONSIDERED 
MYSELF IF I WAS BEHIND THE VEHICLE AND ANYTHING WAS LOOKING DANGEROUS I'D ABORT IT 
THE OFFENDERS WILL COME ANOTHER DAY 
THE VEHICLE'S ABANDONED WITH RUNNERS ON SHELLEY AVENUE RUNNERS 
SHELLEY AVENUE SHELLEY AVENUE RUNNERS' 
OH NINE ONE I. C. AH ONE IN CUSTODY 
ONE I. C. MEANS ONE PERSON FROM THE ABANDONED CAR IS IN CUSTODY 
BUT THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS TO ROUND UP 
THERE'S ANOTHER UNMARKED CAR THERE 
IF THEY CAN GET THERE IN TIME 
ON SHELLEY AVENUE ON THE NUNSTHORPE ESTATE 
IT'S CLEAR WHY THE MICRA HAS BEEN ABANDONED 
IT COULDN'T GO ANY FURTHER 
ITS SCHOOLBOY DRIVER'S BEEN ON A CRASH COURSE 
SCHOOL'S OUT FOREVER 
A NICE BIT OF PARKING 
WELL WE'VE GOT HIM IN CUSTODY ANYWAY 
COPS IN AN UNMARKED SKODA WERE ABLE TO CATCH THE YOUNG JOYRIDER AS HE TRIED TO RUN AWAY 
HE'S ONLY THIRTEEN AND A HALF 
THE ONES THAT WE'RE FINDING IN VEHICLES AT A YOUNG AGE 
HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE HOW TO DRIVE 
THEY'VE GOT A CLUE HOW TO OPERATE THE PEDALS 
AND HOW TO TURN A WHEEL TO STEER A CAR BUT THEY HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE HOW TO DRIVE A CAR 
WHEN HE WAS DRIVEN AWAY IN THE 
POLICE CAR CERTAINLY NO REMORSE THEN 
A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE AND WAVING TO THE CROWD 
PLEASED AT WHAT HE'S DONE 
ON THE SECOND BEND WHERE HE'S LOST CONTROL 
A LOT OF UNDERSTEER AS YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING ON METAL RIMS' 
WITHOUT TYRES AND STRAIGHT INTO THE WALL 
WHAT'S HAPPENED THE IGNITION'S BEEN SMASHED AND HOT WIRED 
EVIDENCE THE CAR WAS STOLEN WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MISSING WINDSCREEN 
THEY REALLY MEANT THE REAR NEARSIDE WINDOW HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF IT TO GAIN ACCESS 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST BEEN POPPED OUT 
THE LITTLE LAD HASN'T JUST BEEN STEALING CARS 
IF THIS HADN'T BEEN REPORTED TILL WE FOUND IT ON THE MOVE 
CHANCES ARE THAT'S NOT BEING FOUND SO WHOEVER'S HAD IT HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN ON A MOOCH ROUND 
NOT ONLY HAVING STOLEN THE VEHICLE BUT STEALING STUFF FROM OTHER VEHICLES USING THIS VEHICLE 
IT'S SOMEBODY'S PRIDE AND JOB IN'T IT 
AS I SAY NOT AN UNUSUAL THING ON THIS ESTATE IF YOU LOOK AROUND ANY OF THE JUNCTIONS 
YOU'LL SEE ALL THE SKID MARKS FROM THE SMVS 
THEY STEAL 'EM ELSEWHERE BRING 'EM ONTO THE ESTATE 
A BIT OF CAVORTING ROUND ON THE ESTATE 
AND THEN A BURN OUT THAT'S WHERE THIS ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING 
IT'S O. K. TO STEAL ANYBODY'S PROPERTY AND BURN IT OUT AS FAR AS THEY'RE CONCERNED 
AS I SAY IT'S MAINLY ELDERLY PEOPLE'S STUFF INSIDE 
THESE TWO WERE PLAYING ON THE FRONT THERE PLAYING FOOTBALL A FEW MINUTES BEFORE 
THEY JUST WENT INSIDE AND IT'S VERY VERY FRIGHTENING IT'S PATHETIC 
IT DOESN'T SHOW ME THAT KIDS THIS AGE KNOW HOW TO DRIVE 
IT'S THE FACT THEY KNOW HOW TO DRIVE AND THEY'RE NOT AFRAID OF THE POLICE OR THE SYSTEM 
YOU LOOK AROUND NOW THERE ARE YOUNG KIDS PLAYING ON THE STREET IT'S THE HALF TERM HOLIDAYS 
AND IT'S COME ROUND THE CORNER THREE TYRES ON IT AT THE MOST 
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S BEEN RUNNING ON THE RIM STRAIGHT INTO THE WALL 
GOD FORBID IF ONE OF THE KIDS HAD BEEN IN FRONT OF THE WALL WE'D BE LOOKING AT A FATAL 
THERE'S NO DETERRENT FOR THEM WE TRY OUR BEST BUT IT'S A BIT OF A LOSING BATTLE 
I JUST SAW A LITTLE BASEBALL CAP RUNNING DOWN THE STREET 
AND THEN I HEARD THE CAR SCREECHING ROUND THE CORNER 
WE SPOKE TO A LOT OF THE WITNESSES PEOPLE WERE COMING UP AND SAYING HOW DISGUSTED THEY WERE BY THE DRIVING 
AND WHAT WERE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT STOPPING CRIME ON THE ESTATE 
I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT WE'RE DOING THE MOST WE CAN 
AS FAR AS ENFORCEMENT'S CONCERNED 
BUT IT CAN ONLY BE BROUGHT DOWN BY EDUCATION 
STOLEN CARS AROUND HERE USUALLY END UP BEING TORCHED 
SO NO EVIDENCE IS LEFT FOR SOCO INVESTIGATORS TO FIND 
EM SOCO SCENES OF CRIME 
HAVE COME TO FINGERPRINT THE CAR AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
THEY USE ALUMINIUM POWDERS AND ALL SORTS OF STUFF IN THE FORENSIC EXAMINATION TEAM 
COMMONLY KNOWN AS C. S. I. NOW C. S. I. GRIMSBY 
ANY FINGERPRINTS FOUND WILL HELP PROVE THE YOUNGSTER CAUGHT NEARBY 
WAS THE ONE INVOLVED 
THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE HE WAS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CAR 
WE CAN'T PROVE THAT HE WAS IN THERE 
BUT IF WE FIND SOMETHING INSIDE THE CAR WHICH WE HAVE THE C. D. PLAYER IF HIS FINGERPRINTS ARE ON THAT 
WE CAN PROVE HE WAS INSIDE THE CAR AND THAT HE STOLE THE C. D. PLAYER FROM ANOTHER VEHICLE 
SO TWO JOBS 
THEY ARE SCANNED AGAINST THE NATIONAL DATABASE OF FINGERPRINTS 
AND WE SEE IF IT COMES BACK WITH A MATCH 
FINGERPRINTS ARE MORE INDIVIDUAL THAN D. N. A. 
SO IT'S A GOOD JOB REALLY JUST ONE FROM THE VEHICLE AND HE'S BEEN HAD 
SO AT THE MINUTE EVERYBODY'S HAPPY 
APART FROM THE FACT THAT THE OWNER'S HAD HIS CAR WRITTEN OFF 
AND THE FACT THAT THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THE BOY HAS BEEN CAUGHT DRIVING 
SO IT PROBABLY WON'T BE THE LAST 
WHEN YOU'VE SEEN THEM IN FRONT OF YOU FOR THE FOURTH TIME 
AS ANOTHER DISQUALIFIED DRIVER TIMES THREE TIMES FOUR THIRTEEN YEARS OLD 
AND THEN AGAIN THEY RECEIVE THE SAME PUNISHMENT FOR THE SAME OFFENCE 
I THINK THE SYSTEM'S GOING WRONG SOMEWHERE 
WHENEVER THERE'S A REPORT OF A STOLEN CAR BEING SIGHTED 
TRAFFIC COPS FROM MILES AROUND RACE TO GET THERE FIRST 
ESPECIALLY IN PLACES LIKE BEVERLEY WHERE THEY DON'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN 
P. C. SIMON CARLISLE AND HIS SERGEANT ROB MAZINGHAM 
ARE RESPONDING TO ONE FROM FIFTEEN MILES AWAY 
LIMA FOUR EIGHT ONE HOTEL BRAVO VICTOR 
WE ARE RESPONDING FROM THE KETCH ROUNDABOUT WE RESPONDED 
BUT MORE IN HOPE THAN EXPECTATION TO BE FAIR 
WITH A VIEW TO GETTING INTO THE AREA IN CASE WE NEEDED TO BE USED TO DEPLOY STINGER 
OR JUST IF THE PEOPLE IN IT DID A RUNNER 
ALL CARS AND EVEN THE POLICE CHOPPER ARE GETTING IN ON THE ACT 
IT'S A MULTI ROLE POLICE VEHICLE AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE 
HAVE GOT TO LOOK AT THE HELICOPTER AS 
THINK OF IT AS A POLICE CAR RESPONDING 
BUT IT'S JUST THAT IT'S IN THE AIR 
ON THE GROUND THE QUICKEST ROUTE FOR SERGEANT MAZINGHAM AND P. C. CARLISLE IS ACROSS COUNTRY 
WE'D HEARD OTHER PATROLS WERE COVERING THE MAIN ROAD 
AND REALLY WE THOUGHT WELL WE'LL CUT ACROSS THROUGH A BACK ROAD 
THEIR SHORTCUT HAS PAID DIVIDENDS 
THERE IT IS THERE IT IS 
THE ASTRA DRIVER'S AVOIDING THE MAIN ROADS AS WELL 
WAS THAT IT YES DEFINITELY 
WE COULDN'T BELIEVE OUR LUCK 
THAT WE'D JUST STUMBLED ACROSS IT ON A ROAD WHEN I NEVER ANTICIPATED SEEING IT 
CHARLIE SIERRA EIGHTY ONE ACTIVE MESSAGE BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM 
THE CLUTCH HAS GONE A BIG PROBLEM 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT 
YEAH THE VEHICLE IS INTO LECONFIELD ON THE BACK ROAD FROM CHERRY BURTON 
INTO LECONFIELD OVER BUT THE CLUTCH HAS GONE I CAN'T GET AFTER HIM 
THE CLUTCH HAD GONE DOWN BUT IT WOULDN'T COME BACK UP SO THE ENGINE WAS REVVING MADLY 
AND WE WERE GOING AT ABOUT FIVE M. P. H. WITH THE STOLEN CAR DISAPPEARING INTO THE VILLAGE 
TO SAY I WAS FRUSTRATED WOULD BE PUTTING IT MILDLY 
IT'S FROM CHARLIE SIERRA EIGHTY ONE THE VEHICLE IS INTO LECONFIELD VILLAGE 
LECONFIELD VILLAGE FROM THE DIRECTION OF CHERRY BURTON 
IS THAT IT THERE 
THAT'S IT JUST GENTLE ON THE CLUTCH THAT'S IT 
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY WE GET A STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE COMING TOWARDS US 
AND WE'RE IN A POSITION 
TO ACTUALLY BE IN THE ACTION 
SO WE REALLY REALLY WANTED TO GET DOWN THERE 
YEAH UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE GOT SOME CLUTCH PROBLEMS 
WE'RE GONNA TRY AND GET UP WITH THE VEHICLE 
WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY EQUIPMENT AT THE MOMENT ALTHOUGH WE HAVE PASSED IT FOR RESPONSE IT'S MILES LANE 
IT'S MILES LANE LECONFIELD 
MILES LANE LECONFIELD AS I SAY WE ARE IN A SUITABLE VEHICLE 
AND SUITABLY TRAINED IN PURSUIT MANAGEMENT OVER 
I HAD A SIMILAR PURSUIT ONLY A FEW MONTHS PREVIOUSLY 
WHERE A CLUTCH HAD COMPLETELY BLOWN UP ON ME 
SO ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS THE STICK I'D GET WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE OFFICE 
THE VOLVO IS P. C. CARLISLE'S 
IT'S ONLY DONE FOURTEEN THOUSAND MILES AND HAD ONE CAREFUL OWNER 
I THINK IT WAS THE EXCITEMENT AND HE WAS PERHAPS A LITTLE HEAVY FOOTED ON THE CLUTCH 
I'VE NEVER HAD A CLUTCH SLIPPING LIKE THAT 
THE SERGEANT LIVES NEARBY AND HE'S GOT A DRASTIC IDEA SHOULD ALL ELSE FAIL 
WE'LL PARK AT MY HOUSE AND I'LL GET MY PRIVATE CAR 
LUCKILY THOUGH HE'S GETTING A HELPING HAND 
OH FROM ONE OF HIS NEIGHBOURS HE WENT THAT WAY 
SHE'S SAYING IT'S GONE UP SAINT CATHERINES DRIVE 
IT'S GONE ROUND ON US I CAN'T GET REVERSE 
THIS CAR'S KNACKERED I'LL JUST ASK 
DAMN BLOODY CAR 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT 
AND SHE WAS GESTICULATING WITH HER HAND DOWN THE SIDE STREET 
SAINT CATHERINES DRIVE FROM A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC 
IT'LL GO BACK TOWARDS CHERRY BURTON BACK TOWARDS CHERRY BURTON OVER 
WHICH WAY ARE YOU GONNA GO I'LL GO BACK THE WAY HE'S GONE 
AND JUST HAVE A MOOCH THROUGH SAINT CATHERINE IN CASE HE'S TRIED TO PARK IT UP 
THE CHOPPER'S RACING TO THE RESCUE TO SAVE THE TRAFFIC COPS' BLUSHES 
BUT IT'S SOME YOUNGSTERS WHO'VE SAVED THE DAY 
WE WENT DOWN A TURNING AND THERE WAS A GROUP OF KIDS 
AND THEY JUST CAME UP TO US AND SAID 
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR TWO PEOPLE WHO'VE GOT OUT OF A CAR 
YES POSSIBLY AND THEY DESCRIBED WHERE THE CAR WAS AND SAID 
THAT'S THEM WALKING UP THE FOOTPATH 
WHERE DID THEY GO 
THAT'S IT WE GOT THEM 
TELL THE HELICOPTER TO WATCH THEM 
YEP CHARLIE ZERO EIGHT ONE WE HAVE GOT THE SUSPECTS 
LOOKED IN MY MIRROR AND THERE WAS A LAD ARM IN ARM WITH A GIRL 
SAUNTERING ALONG THE STREET CASUALLY WANDERING OUT OF THE AREA 
MIRACULOUSLY WE DID GET THE GEAR REVERSED UP 
THERE THEY ARE LET'S GET OUT 
THESE TWO HERE 
CAN I HAVE A WORD FELLA 
JUST HAVE A WORD STAY THERE STAY THERE 
I THINK THEY WERE TRYING TO BRAZEN IT OUT 
THEY WERE SOME LOVING COUPLE OUT FOR A WALK 
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST ON SUSPICION OF THEFT OF A MOTOR VEHICLE 
WHOA YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING 
BUT IT MAY HARM YOUR DEFENCE IF YOU FAIL TO MENTION SOMETHING YOU LATER RELY ON IN COURT 
I DIDN'T DO NOUT PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE ROOF 
PUT YOUR HAND WHERE WE CAN SEE 'EM 
RIGHT WE'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT IT'S ABOUT 
SIR HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING ON YOU THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE 
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT ABOUT A STOLEN CAR ALL RIGHT 
YES YES YOU DO HAVE A PATROL CAR WITH TWO KEEP THE AIRWAVES CLEAR PLEASE FOR THEM TO UPDATE 
I WAS AWARE BY HIS GENERAL DEMEANOUR AND MARKS ON HIM 
THAT HE WAS MORE THAN LIKELY A DRUG ADDICT 
RIGHT WHERE ARE YOUR SHARPES THIS POCKET 
ARE THEY CAPPED YEAH 
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ON ABOUT 
I DID RECOGNISE THE DRIVER 
I REALISED HE WASN'T FROM ROUND THERE 
WE'LL BE NEEDING IT 
ULTIMATELY WE'VE BEEN ALL RIGHT WITH YOU HAVEN'T WE 
WE'VE TOLD YOU WHY YOU'VE BEEN ARRESTED 
YOU'VE ARRESTED US FOR NOTHING I'M NOT GONNA DISCUSS IT ANY MORE 
WE'RE PREPARED TO BE ALL RIGHT WITH YOU 
YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT ON YOU AND WHAT SHARPES YOU'VE GOT 
LET ME FEEL AND I'LL TELL YOU 
THEY GO INTO THIS THING WHERE IT WASN'T US HOW CAN YOU SAY IT 
YOU'VE BEEN SEEN LEAVING A STOLEN CAR IN THIS AREA IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES 
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE UNDER ARREST ON SUSPICION OF THEFT OF THAT VEHICLE UNDERSTAND 
THEY FITTED THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CAR 
I'D SEEN THEM IN THE CAR WHEN THEY WENT THE OTHER WAY 
SO IT WAS CUT AND DRY NO POINT ENTERTAINING ANY CONVERSATION THEN 
I'LL TAKE HER TO THE POLICE VEHICLE O. K. 
JUST GONNA GET IN THE BACK OF THAT POLICE VEHICLE 
HAVE HER SEARCHED AS WELL 
YOU SOON REALISE THAT EVERYONE'S LYING TO YOU 
UNLESS THEY CAN PROVE THEY'RE TELLING THE TRUTH 
IF YOU TAKE THAT APPROACH YOU CAN'T GO FAR WRONG 
JUST MAKE SURE THEY DON'T GO ANYWHERE 
THE THING THAT HAD CAUGHT THEM OUT 
WAS THE FACT THESE KIDS HAD TIPPED US OFF TO THE FACT 
THAT THEY WERE THE ONES FROM THE CAR 
WE SAW COP CARS AND SIRENS COMING DOWN THE LANE 
YEAH WE SAW THE RIOT VAN 
THEY WERE RACING ROUND THE CORNER AND WE KNOW WHO LIVES UP THERE SO 
IT WAS MY AUNTY'S ROAD THEY PULLED INTO HIS AUNTY'S DRIVE 
WE WENT UP THERE AND SAW THEM COMING AND WAS LIKE WHO'S THAT 
THEN IT JUST CLICKED THAT THE COPS WERE COMING 
AND THEY'D BEEN ACTING SUSPICIOUS AND SUDDENLY THEY WERE ALL CASUAL 
THEN WE THOUGHT WE MUST TELL THE POLICE THEY'VE MISSED SOMETHING UNDER THEIR NOSES 
THEY SEEN THEM DRIVE THE CAR IN 
THEN WALK OUT LIKE ALL'S HAPPENED 
FOR ONCE BOYS ON BIKES ARE THE HEROES OF THE DAY 
WITHOUT THEM THE COPS WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT CLUTCHING AT STRAWS 
NORMALLY IT IS KIDS GIVING US GRIEF AND SHOUTING ABUSE 
AND RACING AWAY ON THEIR BIKES OR MINI MOTOS OR WHATEVER 
THIS TIME THEY WERE SPOT ON ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
UNLIKE THE ARRESTED MAN WHO'S NO MORE MR. NICE GUY 
I'M GONNA POISON YOUR DOG 
LET'S GET YOU IN FIRST I'LL POISON IT 
IT'LL BITE YOU BEFORE YOU POISON IT IN YOU GO THEN MATE 
WE'LL GET YOU SORTED AT THE NICK AS QUICK AS WE CAN 
I'LL BET I CAN POISON YOUR DOG 
IT'LL BE A SHORT CONVERSATION 
IT'S HOT WIRED 
ONCE AGAIN THE CAR'S BEEN ALL TOO EASILY STARTED BY BY PASSING THE IGNITION 
YOU SEE VEHICLES WITH THE WIRES ALL HANGING DOWN THAT IS INVARIABLY WHAT THEY'VE DONE 
REMOVED THE IGNITION PART THE KEY PART OUT OF THE SYSTEM 
AND USED THE WIRES TO GET IT GOING 
AND IT'S ALSO FULL OF NICKED GEAR 
A PEDAL CYCLE LOOKS LIKE IT'S A KIDS OF SOME SORT 
A DECENT ONE YEAH REASONABLY DECENT 
THERE WAS A BIKE AND TOOL SETS VARIOUS OTHER ITEMS 
THAT LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE THE SORT OF THING THAT 
WOULD BE KEPT IN A GARDEN SHED 
OBVIOUSLY I WAS SUSPICIOUS THAT THEY WERE STOLEN GOODS 
SOME OF THE ITEMS THOUGH PROBABLY ARE THE DRIVERS 
HE'S DRAWN BACKWARD BLOOD IN PROBABLY PREPARED TO INJECT 
I SUSPECT BECAUSE OF THE FACT HE KNEW THE HELICOPTER WAS BUZZING AROUND 
AND THE NUMBER OF POLICE VEHICLES THAT GOT INTO THE AREA QUICKLY 
THAT'S WHY HE'S PARKED IT UP AND TRIED TO WALK OUT 
WHEN IT'S YOU THAT'S GOT THE CAPTURE AND IT'S YOU THAT'S LOCKED THEM UP 
IT'S A GOOD FEELING IT'S FANTASTIC 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S SO MANY OF YOU AFTER 'EM 
IN GRIMSBY MILLIONS OF POUNDS ARE BEING SPENT ON NEW HOUSING 
BUT UNTIL THEY'RE DEMOLISHED THE OLD HOMES LYING EMPTY 
HAVE BECOME A PLAYGROUND FRO BORED BIDS ON HALF TERM HOLIDAY 
SETTING LIGHT TO THE DERELICT PROPERTY 
IS JUST ONE OF THE GAMES THEY LIKE TO PLAY 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT BURNING OF STOLEN VEHICLES' 
CRASHING THEM INTO PEOPLE'S PROPETIES 
DELIBERATE IGNITIONS OF HOUSES 
ATTACKING THE FIRE CREWS THAT COME TO DEAL WITH IT 
P. C. ALCOCK'S JOB HERE IS TO PROTECT THE FIREFIGHTERS 
NORMALLY THEY'LL COME OUT IN A SINGLE UNIT 
AND THEY'LL BE OVERRUN QUITE QUICKLY WITH KIDS' 
TURNING THE HOSES OFF STEALING EQUIPMENT FROM THE VEHICLE 
THROWING WOOD STONES BREAKING WINDOWS THAT SORT OF STUFF 
BY THE FRONT DOOR RIGHT IT'S PROBABLY SAFE TO GO IN IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOOK 
THE FIRE IS OUT BUT THERE MIGHT BE SOME EVIDENCE TO BE FOUND 
THAT'S THE SOURCE OF IGNITION 
OUR LADS HAVE MOVED IT FROM DOWN HERE 
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING COS THEY'VE SET A BLOCK ON THE STAIRS 
THEY'D PUSHED A SOFA UNDER THE STAIRWELL 
THEY SET FIRE TO THAT AND IT CAUSED A VACUUM FOR THE SMOKE TO GO AWAY 
WHICH MORE INTENSE FIRE SETS IN RAPIDLY 
IT'S GOT DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL NEEDS A BIT OF AN HOOVER 
JUST WATCH YOUR FOOTING THEY TAKE UP FLOORBOARDS 
HOLES IN THE FLOOR AREN'T THE ONLY DANGER 
SOMETIMES GAS CYLINDERS ARE THROWN IN AS WELL 
THEY'VE BEEN SETTING UP CYLINDERS AND BITS AND BOBS 
WITH THE BUILD UP OF HEAT AND EXPANSION IT'S GOT REAL SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES 
THEY TAKE A LOT OF HEAT TO EXPAND AND THE VALVE TO GO 
BUT WHEN THEY DO GO IT'S A SMALL BUMP 
COULD DO WITH A LICK OF PAINT 
DESPITE THE STATE OF THE PLACE AND THE LAST OCCUPANTS HAVING LONG GONE 
THE ELECTRIC'S STILL LIVE 
THAT'S THE ELECTRIC GOING OFF WOW 
THEY'VE DRENCHED THE FLOORBOARDS UPSTAIRS WITH WATER 
WHILST WE'RE LEAVING THE MOISTURE'S HIT THE ELECTRICITY 
AND IT'S SENT ARCS ACROSS THE ROOM 
OH THAT WAS CLOSE MATE 
IF WE'D BEEN IN THERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'D HAVE DONE TO US 
MIGHT HAVE KILLED US MIGHT HAVE DONE ANYTHING 
LUCKY REALLY 
DON'T TOUCH THAT DOOR 
YOU'D THINK IT WAS SAFE TO GO IN WOULDN'T YOU 
FIRE OFFICERS SAY WHEN YOU GET A FIRE 
THE ARSONIST IS USUALLY STILL ABOUT WATCHING TO GET A BUZZ OUT OF IT 
THEY'VE MADE THE EMERGENCY SERVICES COME TO PUT OUT THE FIRE THEY CAUSED 
THEY LIKE THE ATTENTION OF HERE COMS A FIRE ENGINE SHINY AND RED 
THE BANGING NOISE THAT'S THE ELECTRIC 
WHAT WAS THAT NOISE THERE 
HOW DOES IT GO 
THAT WAS IT WHAT WAS IT THAT CAN BLOW UP 
THAT CAN BLOW UP YEAH GET A NEW HAIRCUT 
YOU'D GET A NEW HAIRCUT IF THAT BLOWS UP 
DOWN THE BOTTOM OF THE STREET THERE'S TEN KIDS IF I LEFT NOW 
THEY'D GO AND HAVE A LOOK SEE IF THEY CAN SCAVENGE SOMETHING 
UNAWARE THE ELECTRIC'S STILL ON 
I'LL STAY HERE SOMEONE CAN RELIEVE US 
IT'S A WASTE OF RESOURCES ME BEING HERE AND THE CAR SAT HERE 
THERE'S MORE STUFF GOING ON IN THE TOWN 
YOU CAN'T LEAVE IT THERE COS IF THE KIDS GO IN YOU KNOW 
THEY'RE AT RISK OF INJURY MAYBE WE CARE TOO MUCH 
IN BEVERLY THERE'S A PLACE WHERE CONFESSIONS ARE GOOD FOR THE SOUL 
IT'S NOT FAR FROM THE HISTORIC MINSTER 
IT'S CALLED BEVERLY POLICE STATION 
THAT'S PROPERTY THAT WAS TAKEN OFF HIM AT THE TIME 
A NEEDLE ALL BE IT CAPPED 
THE TWO SUSPECTED CAR THIEVES CAUGHT EARLIER IN THE DAY 
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT HERE TO BE PROCESSED 
THAT MEANS POURING OVER THE EVIDENCE 
AND RELIGIOUSLY GOING THROUGH ALL THE PAPERWORK 
AFTER THE EUPHORIA OF THE JOB AND CATCHING THE PEOPLE IN THE ACT 
THE DOWNSIDE IS THE HOURS OF WRITING 
IT CAN BECOME A LONG DRAWN OUT PROCESS' 
THE LAST ENTRY ON HIS INTELLIGENCE RECORD 
IS THAT THEY MIGHT BE STRIPPING DOWN STOLEN CYCLES 
ROB LOOKED UP HIS INTELLIGENCE REPORT 
AND IT SEEMS HE IS A PROLIFIC OFFENDER IN THE HULL AREA 
HIS LAST OFFENCES WERE STRIPPING DOWN OF BICYCLES ERM 
WHICH MEANS HE TOOK THE IDENTITY OFF 
SO THAT IF HE WAS STOPPED WITH A BICYCLE 
WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRACE WHERE IT'S FROM 
AND HE'D BE ABLE TO SELL IT ON 
THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT WAS HIGHLIGHTING THE FACT THAT HE 
TO A DEGREE IS A ONE MAN CRIME THAT HE IS AN ACTIVE CAR CRIMINAL 
ERM AND AT THAT POINT WAS ACTIVE IN SHED BURGLARIES ON A DAILY BASIS 
AND SLIGHTLY MORE DISTURBINGLY THERE WERE WARNING MARKERS FOR FIREARMS SUGGESTING THAT 
AT SOME POINT HE'D HAD LINKS TO FIREARMS OF SOME DESCRIPTION 
THE BEST WAY OF KEEPING KIDS OUT OF TROUBLE IS TO CATCH THEM YOUNG 
THIS EVENING A LOCAL CUB SCOUT GROUP HAS BEEN INVITED TO LOOK AROUND 
THE GRIMSBY CENTRAL POLICE STATION 
I THINK THEY RANGE FROM SORT OF SEVEN TO TEN UPWARDS' 
IT'S NICE TO GET THEM AT THAT AGE WHERE YOU CAN TRY AND EDUCATE THEM 
TRY AND SHOW THEM WHAT OUR JOB IS AND WHAT IT INVOLVES 
AND TRY AND STEER THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
O. I. CHEEKY YOU CAN'T PRESS ALL THE BUTTONS ARE ON 
PRESS THAT ONE AND THEN YOU PRESS THE STEERING WHEEL 
ANYWHERE PRESS IT ANYWHERE THERE 
PRESS IT AGAIN 
IT'S PART OF THE VISIT WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO COME DOWN AND SHOW THEM AROUND THE TRAFFIC CAR 
EXPLAIN BRIEFLY WHAT WE DO SHOW THEM A BIT OF THE KIT INSIDE 
AND MAKE THEM MORE AWARE THAT WE'RE A FACE TO BE SEEN AND NOT FEARED 
SO THEY'RE MAKING LOADS OF NOISE WITH THE SIRENS THIS IS THE BEST BIT 
JUST SHOWING THEM AROUND THE TRAFFIC CAR WHAT WE CARRY 
EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME 
I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD TO BE ABLE TO SEE HOW POLICE WORK 
THE THINGS THAT THEY DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING FOR SOCIETY 
IT HELPS THEM TO UNDERSTAND BETTER 
THIS IS OUR NEW RECRUIT P. C. BARWOOD 
IT'S BIG BUT YOU'RE GONNA GROW INTO IT AREN'T YOU 
IT'S EDUCATING THEM WITH A SENSE OF FUN 
WHO KNOWS THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION 
IF WE GET A STOLEN CAR AND THE POLICE CAR'S DRIVING BEHIND IT 
WHAT DEVICE CAN WE USE TO PUNCTURE THE TYRES IT'S THIS GUN THINGY 
YOU FIRE IT IT'S LIKE A STAPLE GUN 
OFFICERS IN FRONT LAY DOWN NAILS ON THESE TRACKS THAT'S RIGHT YEAH 
AND THEY GO OVER THEM DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED ANYBODY WHO 
WHAT'S IT CALLED THEN A STINGER YEAH WELL DONE 
WHAT'S A STINGER ANDY'S GONNA SHOW YOU WHAT A STINGER IS 
THEY WERE QUITE KNOWLEDGEABLE SOME OF THEM 
IT'S A COMMON TERM NOW THE POLICE USE A STINGER TO STOP STOLEN CARS 
WHOA O. K. JUST ALL STAND BACK 
IT'S GOT THESE PROTECTIVE CAPS ON 
SO WHAT WE'VE GOT THERE IS LIKE A NAIL 
ALL THESE ARE ALL DIFFERENT NAILS 
SO AS THE VEHICLE DRIVES OVER IT IT'LL PUNCTURE ALL THE TYRES 
IT LOSES AIR OUT OF THE TYRES EVENTUALLY THE CAR WILL SLOW DOWN 
WE'LL BE ABLE TO CATCH THE BADDIES 
WHY'S IT ON A DOG LEAD CAN YOU TAKE IT FOR A WALK 
IT'S SO THAT WHEN WE THROW IT OUT IT GETS THE STOLEN CAR 
AND IF THERE'S A POLICE CAR BEHIND IT YOU CAN PULL IT OUT OF THE WAY 
IF WE CAN STOP THEM GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A STOLEN CAR 
SURELY WE'VE DONE OUR JOB FOR THAT DAY 
THE CUB SCOUTS HAVE A MOTTO BE PREPARED 
NOW IF THEY DO JUMP IN A STOLEN CAR WHEN THEY'RE OLDER 
THEY'LL KNOW TO AVOID TRAFFIC COPS WITH STINGERS 
I WOULDN'T IMAGINE ANY OF THOSE CUB SCOUTS STEALING A CAR 
BEFORE THEY TOUR THE CELLS 
THERE'S ONE LAST INCENTIVE TO STAY ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW 
THAT'S WHAT I PUT ON NAUGHTY PEOPLE 
DO THEY FIT ROUND YEAH THEY FIT ROUND YOUR WRIST 
THEY REALLY ENJOYED IT AND IT'S SOMETHING THEY'VE TAKEN WITH THEM 
IT DID SEEM TO HAVE A REALLY POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE KIDS 
AND IT WAS GOOD FUN FOR US AS WELL 
SCHOOL'S OUT 
FOR EVER 
THE BEST FOR KIDS THOUGH 
APART FROM CHRISTMAS IS THE HULL ANNUAL FAIR 
BLOWN TO PIECES 
IT'S AN ENCHANTING SIGHT FROM THE PATROLLING POLICE HELICOPTER 
WHOSE CREW IS BEING ALERTED TO ANOTHER STOLEN CAR 
SOME SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES 
HE WAS SEEN TRYING TO GET INTO A HOUSE HE'S NOW GOT A VEHICLE 
THAT'S MAKING ITS WAY 
IT'S ON THE A SEVENTY THREE TOWARDS HULL 
DOWN BELOW TRAFFIC COP P. C. BEN TOWNHILL 
HAS PICKED UP THE CALL AND IS MAKING HIS WAY THERE TOO 
EN ROUTE DESCRIPTION PLEASE 
IT'S A FORD SIESTA 
HOTEL NINE THREE EIGHT ALPHA ALPHA GOLF 
AND IT'S FROM BEVERLY ROAD OVER 
SOME OFFICERS FROM C. DIVISION WHICH IS THE RURAL AREA 
WERE FOLLOWING A VEHICLE 
COMING INTO TOWN FROM THE HESSLE AREA 
IT WAS HEADING TOWARDS HULL CITY CENTRE 
RIGHT NOW WE ARE OVERHEAD WE DO HAVE THE CAR ON CAMERA 
I CAN SEE THAT PATROL NOW 
THE HELICOPTER WAS ON OUR CHANNEL AND KEEPING EVERYBODY UPDATED 
THE STOLEN CAR'S GOING INTO THE CITY CENTRE 
'. THE VEHICLE IS FAILING TO STOP WITH THE COPS IN HOT PURSUIT 
WE WERE HEADING TOWARDS THE CENTRE 
H. X. NINETY NINE IT'S CRASH CRASH SILVER STREET JUNCTION 
THE JOYRIDERS HAVE SMASHED INTO A C. C. T. V. CAMERA POLE 
CRASH CRASH RECEIVED OVER 
THERE ARE THREE OF THEM AND THEY'RE ALL OUT AND RUNNING 
H. X. NINETY NINE THE RUNNERS ARE ROUND IN THE CORNER INTO PRIME STREET 
NINE HUNDRED NINETY ONE'S RUNNING ACROSS THE CAR PARK TOWARDS FREETOWN WAY 
IF YOU OR I HAD DONE THAT WE'D HAVE BEEN IN HOSPITAL 
FOR A FEW WEEKS WITH QUITE SERIOUS INJURIES 
BUT THESE SEEM TO BE CATS WITH NINE LIVES AND THEY JUST 
MANAGE TO GET OUT AND RUN EVERY TIME 
JUST STEP AWAY FROM US THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
TWO OF THE OCCUPANTS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT 
THE OUTSTANDING ONE'S GOT THE CHOPPER TO CONTEND WITH 
CAN YOU SEE THEM ERM MALE THAT'S JUST TURNED ON 
THAT'S A YES YES WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND THE THIRD AT THE MOMENT 
THE HELICOPTER WITH ITS THERMAL IMAGING CAMERAS 
CAN WORK WONDERS REALLY 
THEY GENERALLY GO FOR THE DRIVER 
I BELIEVE FROM CHECKING THE VIDEO 
THE DRIVER WAS THE MALE DETAINED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE DAILY MAIL BUILDING 
THEY STEAL A VEHICLE THEY'RE NOW DRIVING A LETHAL WEAPON 
IT'S JUST THE SAME AS PICKING UP A SWORD OR PICKING UP A GUN 
THEY CAN KILL WITH THAT VEHICLE 
I DON'T LIKE THE TERMINOLOGY JOYRIDING BECAUSE IT'S BRINGING JOY TO NOBODY 
APART FROM THIS SIXTEEN YEAR OLD WHO WAS THE DRIVER HE'S HAVING A BALL 
HIS MATE IS PRETTY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF AS WELL 
YOUNG STUPID YOUNG TEENAGE LADS REALLY 
WHO'VE GOT NO RESPECT FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY 
OR SOCIETY AS A WHOLE ERM TOOK IT AS A BIG JOKE 
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST ON SUSPICION OF BURGLARY AS WELL AT AN ADDRESS IN HESSLE O. K. 
YOU'RE STILL UNDER CAUTION WE NEED TO LOOK INTO THAT 
WE ASSISTED WITH THE PRISONERS' TRANSPORTATION AFTER ALL THREE WERE SUCCESSFULLY DETAINED 
THERE'S MORE CAR TROUBLE ON THE NUNSTHORPE ESTATE 
BACK IN GRIMSBY NICKNAMED LOCALLY AS NUNNY 
'. BLUE FIAT PUNTO CAN YOU SEE IT 
'. NOVEMBER PLATED NO OTHER DETAILS AVAILABLE 
VEHICLE TRAVELLING AT SPEED AND DRIVING ERRATICALLY ON THE ESTATE 
AND A YOUNG MALE DRIVER IS ON HIS OWN 
THAT'S RACING UP THIS ESTATE IN GRIMSBY 
WHAT THE PERSON DESCRIBED AS A YOUNG MALE 
POSSIBLY AROUND ELEVEN YEARS OLD 
YEAH IT'S SAFE WE'RE IN THE ALPHA DELTA AREA 
I'LL HAVE A LOOK 
WE WERE IN THE AREA AND DECIDED TO ATTEND 
WHEN I WAS ON LPT I USED TO WORK THIS PATCH AND 
ONE MORNING THERE WAS SIX SMVS SMASHED INTO EACH OTHER BEHIND THE SHOPS ALL BURNT OUT 
IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS TO TAKE OUT WHAT THEY CALL THE TWOK SQUAD 
THE GENERAL VEHICLE CRIME SEEMS TO HAVE DROPPED NOW 
THE ACTUAL DRIVING 
IT'S MORE THEFT FROM VEHICLES NOW WHICH IS OUR MAIN PROBLEM 
THE CAR P. C. ALCOCK'S LOOKING FOR IS NO LONGER RACING UP AND DOWN 
IT'S PARKED UP IN FRONT OF HIM 
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF ITS ELEVEN YEAR OLD DRIVER 
ALPHA QUEBEC TWO EIGHT 
ALPHA QUEBEC TWO EIGHT 
THERE IS A PARKED UNATTENDED PUNTO IT'S NOVEMBER SEVEN ONE THREE 
BRAVO ROMEO JULIET IF YOU CAN JUST POP THAT THROUGH AND SEE WHAT COMES UP 
IT WAS PARKED UP TO THE NEAR SIDE UNATTENDED 
WHICH TO ME IS THE BEST CASE SCENARIO 
YOU DON'T INVOLVED IN A PURSUIT IF IT WAS A YOUNG KID DRIVING 
THEY DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE 
I'VE SEEN THE CARS UP THERE ROLL SMASHING INTO OTHER PARKED CARS 
THE RISK IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT 
THE PUNTO HASN'T BEEN HOT WIRED 
SOMEONE'S GOT THE KEYS FOR IT BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT LEGAL 
DID THE NORMAL POLICE CHECKS 
REVEALED IT HAD NO KEEPER 
IT WASN'T INSURED 
DIDN'T HOLD ANY ROAD TAX THE ENGINE WAS STILL WARM 
GOOD BET THAT IT WAS THE VEHICLE 
I WANT TO RUN IT PAST THE INSPECTOR SEE IF WE CAN GET RECOVERED 
POSSIBLY THE SAME ONE IT'S STILL WARMISH NO TAX NO INSURANCE 
PARKED ON THE FOOTPATH SEE IF HE'LL AUTHORISE ITS RECOVERY 
THE LOCALS OUTSIDE WHOSE HOUSE THE CAR IS PARKED 
HAVE NO IDEA WHOSE IT IS OR WHY IT'S BEEN LEFT THERE 
DO YOU KNOW WHOSE IT IS 
AIN'T GOT THE SLIGHTEST CLUE 
NICE CAR THOUGH 
HOPEFULLY IT'S GONNA BE MADE INTO A SMALL CUBE SOON 
STOP PEOPLE DRIVING ROUND THE STREET BUT IF IT HASN'T BEEN DROVE HOW CAN YOU TAKE IT IT HAS 
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE 
WHAT BECAUSE OF WHAT 
BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN DRIVING UP AND DOWN THE STREET AT SILLY SPEEDS 
IT'S GOT NO INSURANCE NO TAX THE PERSON DRIVING IT PROBABLY HAS NO DOCUMENTS 
AND IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF YOU LOT THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA SAY 
ALSO WE'VE PULLED UP 
AND YOU COULD SEE THEY'RE EDGY STRAIGHTAWAY 
AS I GOT OUT ONE OF THEM 
WAS LOOKING AROUND A BIT NERVOUS AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE HOUSE 
AND NEVER CAME OUT AGAIN JUST DISAPPEARED 
SO ONE OR TWO OF THEM HAVE BEEN DRIVING 
BUT WE'VE GOT NO EVIDENCE 
AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY COULD SAY YES I'VE BEEN IN IT BUT PROVE I'VE BEEN DRIVING 
THE PEOPLE ROUND HERE WON'T PUT A STATEMENT IN BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE GRIEF FROM IT 
THEY'LL BE HAPPY THAT IT'S GETTING TAKEN IF THEY AUTHORISE IT BUT THE PROBLEM NOW 
IS THAT NO ONE'S WITH IT A WITNESS WON'T PUT PEN TO PAPER 
WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S DRIVEN IT TO GET THE ROAD TRAFFIC OFFENCES 
IT'S AN UNINSURED VEHICLE PROBABLY DRIVEN WITH NO DOCUMENTS 
DRIVEN DANGEROUSLY 
THEY NEED A TICKING OFF I JUST WANT IT TO GET AUTHORISED 
IF WE LEFT IT THERE ALMOST GUARANTEED SOMEONE WILL BE IN THAT CAR AGAIN DOING THE SAME THING 
HAVE I MISSED IT ALL 
NOWT TO SEE 
HAVE YOU SEEN THE STATE OF THE ROADS THE STATE OF THE WHOLE ESTATE 
ONCE YOU'RE UP THERE THE DRUMS START BEATING 
IF SOMEONE'S UP FOR IT THEY'LL TRY AND WIND YOU UP TRY AND ENTICE YOU TO CHASE THEM 
FORTY MILES AWAY IN HULL 
ONE OF THE YOUNG CAR THIEVES WHO CRASHED IN THE CITY CENTRE 
IS COMING DOWN FROM HIS HIGH 
WAKEY WAKEY 
YOU GOT ALL HIS PROPERTY 
THIS WAY 
IT HAD OBVIOUSLY TAKEN IT'S TOLL ON HIM COS HE'D FALLEN ASLEEP 
IN THE TIME IT TOOK US TO GET FROM THE SCENE TO QUEEN'S GARDENS 
WE HAD TO WAKE HIM UP 
I WANNA GO TO SLEEP WELL PLENTY OF TIME FOR THAT IN A MINUTE 
HIS TWO MATES THOUGH ARE STILL BUZZING 
WHAT IF WE'RE GOING TO JAIL I'M GOING BACK 
AYE I WILL BE 
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN YOU GINGER 
THEY HAVE NO RESPECT 
THEY DON'T VALUE THINGS LIKE YOU OR I WOULD 
LIFE IS A BIG JOKE TO THEM 
I NEARLY KILLED YOU TONIGHT 
YOU PUSHED ME INTO THE 
WE ROBBED THE FORD FIESTA AND CRASHED IT OUTSIDE THE LANE 
WE'RE BOOKED IN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A BIT OF A QUEUE AT THE MOMENT 
HE'LL BE BOOKED IN AND BEDDED DOWN FOR THE NIGHT ONCE THE EVIDENCE HAS BEEN COLLATED HE'LL BE INTERVIEWED 
PUT THAT HAND ON THE DESK 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'VE BEEN ARRESTED 
I'M GONNA AUTHORISE YOUR DETENTION TO SECURE AND PRESERVE EVIDENCE 
THAT MEANS THAT THE OFFICERS ARE GONNA TAKE A STATEMENT 
MAKE SOME ENQUIRIES AND THEN WE'LL GET YOU INTERVIEWED LATER ON ALL RIGHT 
HOW OLD ARE YOU SIXTEEN HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ARRESTED BEFORE 
ONLY ONCE 
DO YOU STILL GO TO SCHOOL OR HAVE YOU LEFT 
I'VE JUST LEFT 
TO HAVE THAT RESULT I THOUGHT IT WAS RIGHT AND PROPER 
THAT WE SHOULD GIVE OURSELVES A PAT ON THE BACK COS IT WORKED OUT WELL 
BACK IN GREAT GRIMSBY P. C.'S SUE SCOTT AND ANDY STEVENSON 
ARE ON THE TRAIL OF A CAR JUST REPORTED STOLEN 
WHICH IS WHY WE HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION 
HOPING TO INTERCEPT IT BEFORE HE GOT TO HIS HOME ADDRESS 
THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN THIS TIME 
AS MUCH AS HE WOULD LIKE TO HELP P. C. ALCOCK'S STILL TIED UP WAITING FOR HIS FIAT PUNTO 
TO BE RECOVERED 
YOU LISTEN TO THE RADIO 
WE KNOW UNTIL THE RECOVERY VEHICLE ARRIVES IT COULD BE ANYTHING 
FROM TEN MINUTES TO AN HOUR SO THERE WAS NOT MUCH ELSE TO DO 
YOU WANT TO GO BUT YOU CAN'T 
WITH MODERN CARS BECOMING MORE SECURE 
HOT WIRING IS BECOMING A DYING ART 
THE RECENT TREND SEEMS TO BE THAT 
THEY TARGET PEOPLE'S HOUSES TO ACTUALLY GET THE KEYS FROM WITHIN 
GENERALLY PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR KEYS EITHER CLOSE TO THE DOOR 
OR IN A DOWNSTAIRS ROOM WHILE THEY'RE ASLEEP UPSTAIRS 
IT'S GENERALLY JUST EASY PICKINGS FOR THE CRIMINAL FRATERNITY TO DO THIS 
GET IN BE AWAY BEFORE ANYONE EVEN KNOWS THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG 
AT LAST FOR P. C. ALCOCK THE WAITING AROUND WHILE EVERYTHING GOES ON ELSEWHERE IS OVER 
THE RECOVERY TRUCK HAS ARRIVED 
IT'S ANOTHER PAT ON THE BACK FOR THE COPS 
ONE LESS ILLEGAL MOTOR ON THE ROAD 
THEY'VE COST THE POLICE ONE HUNDRED FIVE 
IT'S ALL MONEY THESE DAYS ISN'T IT BUT 
IF YOU WEIGH IT UP IT'S QUITE CHEAP TO STOP SOMETHING HAPPENING DOWN THE LINE 
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST 
IT NEVER SEEMS TO BE TOO LATE TO GO OUT CYCLING IN GRIMSBY 
BUT P. C.'S LIAM CLAWLEY AND IAN BOYD ALWAYS SUSPECT THE WORST WHEN 
THE BIKE RIDERS ARE YOUNG BOYS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE LIGHTS 
WELL THERE WERE FOUR KIDS ON PEDAL CYCLES NORMALLY THEY'VE GOT LIGHTS ON 
AND THERE WERE BASICALLY JUST GONNA BE WORDS OF ADVICE ABOUT NOT HAVING LIGHTS ON 
AS THE POLICE CARS PULLED UP THREE OF THEM TURNED ROUND AND LEGGED IT 
THEY WANNA GO THE OTHER WAY LIAM WHAT FOR 
WE'LL HAVE A BIT OF A SEARCH NOW COS THEY'VE GOT BAGS ON THEM MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING IN THEIR BAGS 
THE BOYS ON BIKES DON'T CARE FOR LIGHTS AT ALL 
ESPECIALLY BLUE FLASHING ONES 
JUST HERE 
WE'LL CUT THROUGH THE BACK AND I'LL GO AND HAVE A LOOK 
THAT WAY IF THEY COME BACK THIS WAY I'LL COME TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS CUL DE S. A. C. 
THE BOYS COULD GET A THIRTY TICKET FOR HAVING NO LIGHTS 
P. C. BOYD'S NOT GOING TO LET THEM GET AWAY WITHOUT A CHASE 
THEY'VE EITHER COME OUT HERE OR THE BOTTOM 
HAVE YOU GOT UP THERE MATE 
YEAH I'VE GONE ALL THE WAY ROUND MATE THEY'VE NOT COME ONTO SAINT MICHAELS 
THEY HAVEN'T COME ONTO THE ESTATE THIS END EITHER 
MAYBE DOUBLE BACK UP AGAIN THEN 
ALL RIGHT MATE 
THREE OF THEM HAVE TURNED ROUND AND LEGGED IT ON THEIR BIKES 
MADE OFF IT LOOKS A BIT SUSPICIOUS 
COS WE GET A LOT OF CAR CRIME COMMITTED BY PEOPLE ON PEDAL CYCLES 
AND IT'S JUST A ROUTINE STOP REALLY FOR THAT 
ONE HAD A SHOULDER BAG LIKE A BACKPACK 
AND OBVIOUSLY SAT NAVIGATION SYSTEMS ARE FLAVOUR OF THE MONTH 
THE CYCLISTS HAVE MANAGED TO NAVIGATE A COURSE TO FREEDOM 
BIT STRANGE THAT 
THEY'LL COME AGAIN WON'T THEY YEAH COURSE THEY WILL 
ACROSS TOWN P. C.'S SCOTT AND STEVENSON HAVE REACHED THE ADDRESS OF THE PERSON 
SUSPECTED OF STEALING THE CAR THEY'RE LOOKING FOR 
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF IT 
YET 
STEAM COMING OFF THAT CAR 
JUST TURN ROUND FOR US 
IT'S NOT STEAM 
WHAT IS IT OH MY WORD 
SO WE WENT DOWN ONE OF THE SIDE STREETS 
AND THERE IS THIS VEHICLE THAT HAD JUST BEEN SET ALIGHT 
SO THE OFFENDERS MUST HAVE SEEN OUR POLICE CAR TRAWLING THE STREETS 
YEAH WE'VE GOT THIS VEHICLE ON ANDERBY DRIVE 
THE VEHICLE HAS ONLY JUST BEEN SET ALIGHT 
CAN WE GET THE FIRE BRIGADE AS SOON AS PLEASE 
THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY SEEN US PARKED DOWN THERE HAVEN'T THEY 
THEY MUST HAVE DONE 
SOMEBODY'S PRIDE AND JOY BEEN SET ON FIRE 
AND THE KIDS WERE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN THAT HAD DONE IT 
IT HAD JUST BEEN SET ALIGHT IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF SECONDS 
THAT THE FLAMES WERE TEN FOOT HIGH 
IF WE CAN GET THE FIRE BRIGADE 
THIS VEHICLE'S NOW WELL ABLAZE NEAR TO RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES 
ROB'S PULLED BACK FOR OUR OWN SAFETY 
RECEIVE OVER 
THAT'S BEEN NICKED ANYWAY WE WERE LOOKING FOR IT 
WE STAYED THERE LOOKING FOR THE OFFENDERS IN CASE THEY CAME BACK 
BECAUSE OFTEN THEY LIKE TO RETURN TO THE SCENE AND GLORIFY IT 
AND WATCH WHAT THEY'VE ACHIEVED 
THEY GET A KICK OUT OF DOING THAT 
RECENTLY THE FIRE BRIGADE 
HAVE BEEN ATTACKED ON THAT PARTICULAR ESTATE 
WITH BRICKS SO WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALL RIGHT 
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE WEREN'T A FEW SECONDS EARLIER 
AND FOUND THEM IN THE STREET 
YEAH LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW CAN YOU SEE ME 
I'VE GOT PIZZA AND EVERYTHING 
TRYING TO GET UNDER THE BONNET USING CROW BARS AND SAWS TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THE FIRE IS COMPLETELY OUT 
WHAT THEY'VE FOUND IN THE PAST IS THAT IF YOU DON'T CHECK UNDERNEATH 
COS OF ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE UNDERNEATH IT CAN EASILY REIGNITE 
WITH ALL THE FLUIDS THAT ARE UNDERNEATH THERE 
IT'S JUST A PRECAUTION 
IT'S TOO LATE TO SAVE ANY EVIDENCE 
MUCH TO THE FRUSTRATION OF THE COPS 
WHO ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED TO TACKLE FIRES 
I THINK SOMETIMES WELL IF I'D GOT A FIRE EXTINGUISHER 
WE COULD HAVE PUT IT OUT 
BUT THE DECISION IS THAT WE DON'T CARRY THEM SO WE HAVE TO WAIT 
THEY THINK THEY'VE GOT A GOOD CHANCE OF GETTING AWAY WITH IT 
COS OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T BE SO PREVALENT 
IN IT'S BURNT OUT STATE 
IT'S A DANGER TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC PASSING 
AND WE WAITED FOR IT TO BE RECOVERED 
NEAR THE TOWN CENTRE 
P. C.'S BOYD AND CLAWLEY'S LATE NIGHT PEDAL CYCLISTS HAVE COME AGAIN 
AH HA AH HA 
BOYS ON BIKES 
AS IF BY MAGIC 
ANYBODY ON A BIKE AT THIS TIME IS UP TO SUMMAT AREN'T THEY 
AND NOW HE'S WALKING HIS BIKE 
LIKE A GOOD BOY 
ONE OF THEM HAS STOPPED FOR A CHAT THIS TIME 
YES HELLO 
DO YOU NOT HAVE LIGHTS ON YOUR BIKE 
WHY NOT 
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS LOOK HOW DARK YOUR CLOTHING IS 
THE BOY SAYS HE'S DONE NOTHING WRONG 
WHY'S YOUR MATE LEGGED IT 
WHY ARE YOU OUT ON YOUR BIKE AT TWO FIFTEEN AM WITH NO LIGHTS ON 
RIDING ROUND 
P. C. BOYD IS SUSPICIOUS OF BOYS ON BIKES 
YOU GOT ANY POCKETS NO 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN YOUR POCKETS 
HAVE YOU BEEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE BEFORE NO 
IS THIS YOUR BIKE 
YEP THAT'S MY MATE'S 
EVERYONE THAT RIDES A BIKE IN GRIMSBY IT'S ALWAYS THEIR MATE'S 
IT IS MY MATE'S OH IT IS 
YEAH WHY WOULD YOUR MATE LEND YOU HIS BIKE 
SO WHY WOULD HE LEND YOU HIS THEN 
PARDON WHY WOULD HE LEND YOU HIS THEN 
COS HE'S NOT USING IT WHAT'S YOUR MATE CALLED 
BEN BEN WHAT 
BEN BEN WHO 
MUTTERS A SURNAME 
WHERE'S HE LIVE 
EH 
WHAT NUMBER DUNNO 
HE'S YOUR MATE YOU MUST KNOW I KNOW THE HOUSE NOT THE NUMBER 
YOU'D BETTER GIVE ME SOME DETAILS SO I CAN VERIFY WHETHER THIS BIKE YOURS 
OR HIS OTHERWISE I MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF YOU 
WHERE DO YOU KNOW HIM FROM THEN 
I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR QUITE A BIT FROM SCHOOL 
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPELL HIS SURNAME 
NO NEVER SEEN HIS NAME WRITTEN DOWN NO 
I DIDN'T HANG AROUND WITH HIM MUCH 
OH HAS HE GOT A TELEPHONE NUMBER 
YEAH WHAT'S HIS NUMBER I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE 
WAS BEN ON THE OTHER BIKE 
PARDON WAS THAT BEN ON THE OTHER BIKE 
THAT'S DEAN DEAN DEAN WHO 
DUNNO HIS SECOND NAME YOU DUNNO 
IS HE YOUR MATE AS WELL DEAN YEAH 
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM YOU DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS YEAH DEAN 
I DON'T KNOW HIM VERY WELL 
YOU DON'T SO YOU DON'T KNOW HIM VERY WELL 
BUT ARE OUT AT THIS TIME IN THE MORNING WITH HIM 
YOU DON'T KNOW BEN VERY WELL BUT YOU'VE GOT HIS BIKE 
I KNOW BEN WELL I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPELL HIS SURNAME RIGHT 
P. C. BOYD DOESN'T LIKE BOYS ON BIKES OR BEING TAKEN FOR A RIDE 
HE'S GOING TO SEIZE THE BIKE 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN MARK MARK WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING 
YOU'LL BE WALKING COS YOU'RE NOT TAKING THAT WITH YOU 
WHOEVER OWNS IT IF THEY COME TO THE POLICE STATION 
WITH SOME IDENTIFICATION AND PROOF OF OWNERSHIP THEY CAN HAVE IT BACK 
ALL RIGHT I'M HAVING THAT NOW YOU'RE WALKING SEE YOU LATER 
IT'S A BIT GLIB TO SAY WE'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE 
BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS A NEW ONE TOMORROW BUT THERE'LL BE A STORY 
SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT 
AND YOU CHECK IT OUT AND YOU PROVE IT 
AND YOU TAKE THE NECESSARY ACTION 
BUT NOW THE LAD'S STORY DOESN'T CHECK OUT 
BOYD'S BEEN LEFT WITH A BIT OF A PROBLEM 
SHALL I PEDAL CYCLE IT IN 
CAN YOU TOW ME IN 
CAN YOU TOW ME IN WELL THEY ME OFF PEDAL CYCLISTS 
THEY RIDE AROUND HERE IN THE DARK BURGLING OUT OF CARS 
YOU CAN'T CATCH THEM COS THEY'RE ON BIKES 
ONCE ON BIKES WE CAN'T PURSUE OR CHASE THEM AND IT'S A NIGHTMARE 
THE MORE TAKEN OFF THE ROAD THE BETTER IN MY OPINION 
GIVE HIM A BIT OF INCONVENIENCE HE'S NOW GOT TO PROVE THAT HE OWNS THAT 
OR WHOEVER HE'S BORROWED IT FROM OWNS THAT 
I'D PUT TEN BOB TO A POUND THAT THAT'S BEEN NICKED 
BUT I CAN'T PROVE HE'S STOLEN IT 
WE SHOULD TREAT PEDAL CYCLES LIKE WE TREAT MOTORCARS REALLY 
ANYTHING THAT'S GOT NO LIGHTS ON 
IT GETS CONFISCATED LIKE UNDER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE FOR THE VEHICLES 
AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE PROOF OF OWNERSHIP BEFORE YOU GET IT BACK 
IF NOT WITHIN SEVEN DAYS IT GETS CRUSHED 
GET THEM OFF THE ROAD 
COS THEY'RE THE SOURCE OF MOST CRIME THESE 
KIDS LIKE HIM RIDING ABOUT 
NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF THE TOWN'S FINE IT'S FIVE PER CENT THAT LET'S IT DOWN 
THAT TAKES UP NINETY PER CENT OF OUR TIME 
TALLY HO 
THE THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BOY WHO STOLE AND CRASHED THE NISSAN MICRA IN GRIMSBY 
RECEIVED A TWELVE MONTH SUPERVISION ORDER 
AND WAS BANNED FROM DRIVING AGAIN FOR ANOTHER YEAR 
I'M SURE WHEN HE RETURNED HOME FROM COURT AND WAS LYING IN BED 
I'LL BET HE WAS IN TEARS FOR HAVING SOME MORE POINTS 
AND LOSING HIS DRIVING LICENCE THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE 
THE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WHO NEARLY CAUSED A RAIL DISASTER 
WHEN HE CRASHED ON THE TRACKS WAS ALSO BANNED FOR DANGEROUS DRIVING 
BUT HE WAS SENTENCED TO TEN MONTHS IN YOUTH CUSTODY AS WELL 
AND THE MAN WHO PRETENDED TO BE OUT FOR A STROLL WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND 
WAS FOUND GUILTY OF AGGRAVATED VEHICLE TAKING AND DRIVING WHILST DISQUALIFIED 
HE WAS SENTENCED TO FOUR MONTHS IN PRISON 
HIS GIRLFRIEND WAS NOT CHARGED
