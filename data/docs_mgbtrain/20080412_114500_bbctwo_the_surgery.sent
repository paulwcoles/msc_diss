IF SOMEONE CAN AFFORD IT THEN THEY CAN AFFORD IT IF YOU CAN'T TOUGH 
THE WORLD IS UNFAIR 
HELLO AND WELCOME I'M JEFF LEACH THIS IS THE SURGERY 
HAVE A SEAT YOU WONDERFUL PEOPLE SIT DOW OW N. 
AMAZING NOW MY NAN SAID IT WAS RUDE TO TALK ABOUT MONEY AND CLASS 
BUT TODAY THAT'S ALL WE'RE DOING SORRY NAN 
FIRST UP DOES IT MATTER IF THE PERSON YOU WANNA HOOK UP WITH 
IS LOADED AND YOU HAVEN'T GOT A PENNY 
K. FED AND BRITNEY DIDN'T EXACTLY LAST LONG DID THEY NO 
WHAT ABOUT WHERE YOU GO TO SCHOOL 
WILL AN ETON BOY 
WHO'S USED TO HANGING OUT WITH PRINCE WILLS AND HARRY 
EVER HANG OUT WITH KIDS WHO WENT TO THEIR LOCAL COMP 
AND WOULD THEY WANT TO 
BEFORE THESE PEASANTS REVOLT LET'S GET THE WORD 
FROM THE SURGERY'S VERY OWN WELL TO DO WOMEN 
HI I'M POPPY AND I'M HOLLY IT'S FREEZING OUT HERE 
BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA STOP US FROM GETTING THE OPINIONS OF YOU 
THE GREAT BRITISH PUBLIC EXACTLY SO WE WANT TO KNOW 
IS IT POSSIBLE TO CLOSE THE CLASS DIVIDE 
LET'S FIND OUT 
DO YOU THINK THE CLASS DIVIDE IS A PROBLEM NOT REALLY 
I DO COS WHEN YOU COME INTO TOON PEOPLE LOOK DOWN ON YOU AS IF YOU'RE DIFFERENT FROM THEM 
THERE'S OFTEN FIGHTS BETWEEN DIFFERENT CLASSES FIGHTS BETWEEN CLASSES OFTEN 
I'M BETTER OFF I LIVE IN A BIG HOUSE AND ALL THAT 
BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE TREATED DIFFERENT 
IF YOU'RE FROM A POORER BACKGROUND PEOPLE THINK YOU 
IF YOU'RE MORE RICH THEN PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE BETTER THAN YOU 
IF YOU'RE MORE POOR YOU'RE SEEN AS LIKE IF YOU'RE RICH 
ALL THE BOYS GO FOR YOU COS THEY THINK SHE'S GOT MONEY 
THERE'S A BIG CLASS MONEY DIVIDE 
BECAUSE OF HOUSING AND JUST THE AREA IN GENERAL WITH SCHOOL 
THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT SCHOOLS IN OUR AREA AN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL AND THERE'S SOME PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
MONEY CANNAE BUY YOU HAPPINESS AND IT CANNAE BUY YOU PALS EITHER 
EXACTLY DO YOU THINK THE CLASS DIVIDE WILL EVER CLOSE NO COS IT'S GONNA BE PASSED DOWN ON GENERATIONS 
IF YOU HAVE MONEY AND THERE'S STILL GONNA BE COUNCIL ESTATES THERE'LL ALWAYS BE THAT DIVIDE 
SO THERE WE HAVE IT DOES THE CLASS DIVIDE REALLY EXIST WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS AT ALL OF COURSE THERE'S A DIVIDE 
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER I'VE DATED PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES 
WELL NOT REALLY A SIDE IS IT STATE SCHOOL PRIVATE SCHOOL 
I'VE GOT FRIENDS ON BOTH SIDES THERE IS A DIVIDE 
YEAH THERE IS A DIVIDE BUT I'VE SAID THAT 
TELL HER HOW IS THERE A DIVIDE THEN WELL 
I THINK IT'S THAT YOU'RE GONNA EXCUSE ME FOR THAT TERRIBLE LANGUAGE 
THAT YOU'RE IT'S CLASS THING IT'S TERRIBLY RUDE BUT CARRY ON 
IF YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PERSONALITY AND ONE WORKED IN MCDONALD'S AND ONE IS A BARRISTER 
WHO ARE YOU GONNA PICK NOT THE PERSON WHO WORKS IN MCDONALD'S 
I'M NOT GONNA WALK UP TO SOMEONE AND SAY HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU GOT AM I 
NO BUT YOU'LL PROBABLY LOOK AT THE WAY THEY'RE DRESSED HOW THEY ACT AND TALK ER 
IF THE WAY THAT THE ACT IF THEY'RE A BARRISTER IS BETTER WHAT'S WRONG WITH GOING FOR THAT PERSON 
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT A BARRISTER IS GOING TO ACT BETTER THAN SOMEONE IN MCDONALD'S 
YOU JUST SUGGESTED THE PERSON AT MCDONALD'S WOULD ACT DIFFERENTLY ANYONE ELSE THINK THERE'S A DIVIDE 
IS IT POSSIBLE TO BRIDGE THAT GAP IN RELATIONSHIPS AND FRIENDSHIPS 
WAIT HOLD ON A SECOND 
O. K. ALL RIGHT 
YOU'RE TELLING ME SOMEONE'S GOT BETTER MONEY SO YOU GO OUT WITH THEM 
SO WHAT ABOUT WHEN THE MONEY'S FINISHED THE RELATIONSHIP ENDS 
THAT DEPENDS ON IF YOU'RE A GOLD DIGGER OR NOT 
SAY YOU GO OUT WITH SOMEONE WHO'S A BARRISTER BECAUSE HE'S GOT MORE MONEY 
THE OTHER PERSON THAT WORKS IN MCDONALD'S HE'S GOT THE SAME PERSONALITY 
BUT YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH THE BARRISTER BECAUSE HE'S GOT MORE MONEY NO 
IS THAT TRUE YOU GO TO QUITE A NICE SCHOOL DON'T YOU CHARTERHOUSE 
YAY IT'S A GREAT ONE SEE YOU AT THE OPEN DAY 
AND WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE DO YOU FEEL THERE'S A CLASS DIVIDE 
IS IT POSSIBLE TO BRIDGE THE GAP DO YOU MIX WITH PEOPLE FROM STATE EDUCATION 
YEAH I WENT OUT WITH A FEW STATE SCHOOL GIRLS AND I KEEP DOING IT COS THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT 
THERE'S STILL THE SAME PERSON HOW DID YOU FIND THAT EXPERIENCE FINE 
YOU JUST HAVE TO PAY A BIT MORE 
WHAT WHAT DO YOUR PARENTS THINK ABOUT THAT 
THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT WHAT WAS THEIR REASONING BEHIND THAT 
THAT SHE GOES TO A STATE SCHOOL SO THEY JUST DISOWNED YOUR FRIENDSHIPS 
BECAUSE SHE WENT TO A STATE SCHOOL NO THEY'D STILL BE FRIEND 
BUT THEY'D TELL ME WHAT THEY THOUGHT PEOPLE FROM CERTAIN CLASSES CAN'T BE FRIENDS 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS EXACTLY 
WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE FROM STATE SCHOOLS HERE DO THEY FEEL THAT THEY CAN'T 
ASSOCIATE WITH PEOPLE FROM PRIVATE EDUCATION YOU DO 
BASICALLY I GO TO A STATE SCHOOL AND THE WAY IS FEEL IS THAT 
I'M LOOKED UPON DIFFERENT MAYBE BECAUSE I TALK DIFFERENTLY YEAH 
O. K. I'M NOT STREET 
BUT THE WAY I GREW UP PEOPLE TALK A CERTAIN WAY 
AND I DON'T LIKE BEING CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO WENT TO HIGHER EDUCATION 
DON'T YOU JUDGE THOSE PEOPLE NO I DON'T THEY JUDGE ME 
I KNOW THEY JUDGE ME SO I'M GONNA LOOK ON THEM DIFFERENTLY 
IF I SAY MY NAME'S AYANA WOULDN'T YOU THINK OF ME DIFFERENTLY 
OBVIOUSLY I'M GONNA LOOK DOWN ON THEM THEY'RE JUDGING ME 
NO IT'S NOT MUTUAL ALL RIGHT 
CAN I JUST SAY 
IT'S AT THE SAME TIME FINISH YOUR POINT QUICKLY 
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY 
IS IT'S CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU FEEL A CERTAIN WAY ABOUT THEM 
I'M NOT SAYING EVERYONE'S THE SAME BUT I'M TELLING YOU FROM NOW 
WHEN YOU TALK A CERTAIN WAY PEOPLE JUDGE YOU FAIR ENOUGH 
BECAUSE THEY'RE JUDGING YOU YOU THINK WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM WITH ME THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING 
LOOK LET'S LET THIS LADY REPLY NOW 
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN AND IT'S HORRIBLE 
NOW SAME WAY YOU THINK THEY'RE JUDGING YOU 
IS THE SAME WAY THEY THINK YOU'RE JUDGING THEM 
HOW CAN I BE JUDGING THEM IF I'M SPEAKING TO THEM 
BUT THEY'RE TALKING TO YOU AS WELL CHARLOTTE AND JO YOU BOTH 
GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOL DO YOU JUDGE PEOPLE WHO GO TO STATE SCHOOL 
NO I'M GOING TO A STATE SCHOOL FOR SIXTH FORM I DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE 
I JUDGE PEOPLE ON THEIR PERSONALITY NOT ABOUT WHERE 
DO YOU FEEL THEY MIGHT JUDGE YOU YEAH EVERYBODY JUDGES EVERYBODY 
IF I SEE YOU I'M GONNA THINK OH SHE'S A BIT I WILL THINK THAT AND I'M SURE 
SO HOW DO WE BREAK DOWN THAT CLASS DIVIDE THEN 
IT'S BEEN HERE FOR EVER 
I WAS MEETING SOME MATES WHO GO TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL 
THEY SAID WHAT SCHOOL DO YOU GO TO I GO HENDON THEY WENT OH AND WALKED OFF 
HENDON'S AROUND MY MANOR THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO I AM 
I'M NOT SAYING EVERYBODY'S LIKE THAT COS THEY WERE MY MATE'S MATES 
SHE GOES TO PRIVATE SCHOOL I GET ALONG BRILLIANT WITH HER 
BUT SHE DOESN'T BASE YOUR FRIENDSHIP ON THE WAY YOU SPEAK NO 
THE ONLY REASON I WAS UPSET WITH THEM PEOPLE 
IS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET TO KNOW ME I'VE BEEN TO LIKE BOTH 
STATE AND PRIVATE 
AND THEN WHEN I WENT TO A STATE SCHOOL FROM A PRIVATE SCHOOL 
I FELT PEOPLE TURNED THEIR NOSE UP AT ME YOU HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE 
YEAH BUT THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU WERE AT STATE SCHOOL 
AS A STATE SCHOOL WE DON'T JUDGE ANYBODY WE JUST GET ON WITH IT THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL 
PEOPLE AT STATE SCHOOL CERTAINLY DO JUDGE PEOPLE THEY DO 
I HAVE BEEN STATE SCHOOLS JUDGE PEOPLE THEY AIN'T GOT A REASON TO DO THAT 
HANG ON A SECOND LET THIS GENTLEMAN EXPLAIN HIS POINT 
I HAVE QUITE A POSH ACCENT YES YOU DO 
SEE THAT'S JUDGING ME ISN'T IT AND YOU'RE FROM A STATE SCHOOL 
I'M JUST CONFIRMING YEAH YOU DO IT COMES OFF AS QUITE POSH YEAH 
THAT'S MY POINT PEOPLE FROM STATE SCHOOLS DO JUDGE ME 
YOU'RE NOT A BARRISTER ARE YOU I'M NOT I'M AFRAID 
I WAS GONNA SAY CARRY ON CARRY ON 
BECAUSE OF THE SPORTS I LIKE MY ACCENT 
THEY IMMEDIATELY JUDGE ME AND CLASS ME AS A POSH PERSON BUT THAT DOESN'T SEE 
STATE SCHOOL PEOPLE DO THAT THAT IS A JUDGMENT RIGHT THERE 
IT'S THE POINT THAT HE'S MAKING THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE NOT GONNA TALK TO YOU 
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE OPPOSITE WAY AS WELL IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY 
COS YOU'RE HIGHER UP SO YOU'RE LOOKING DOWN 
YOU'RE SUGGESTING THERE IS A CLASS SYSTEM AND WE THINK WE'RE HIGHER IT'S NOT THAT 
SOMEBODY FROM AN ESTATE FOR EXAMPLE IS GONNA HAVE A DIFFERENT MENTALITY TO YOU 
THAT'S WHY WE GROW UP IN A ROUGHER AREA 
THAT'S WHAT IT IS SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT YOU LEARN TO JUDGE PEOPLE QUICKLY FOR BEING REAL OR NOT 
NOBODY'S GONNA SHOW OFF TO SOMEBODY COS OF POSSESSIONS NO 
BUT AS IT GOES HIGHER UP DO YOU THINK THAT HAPPENS AT OUR SCHOOL 
I GOT THIS I GOT THAT 
IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE YOU GO TO CLUBS YOU GOT MAYFAIR 
SO IT DOES HAPPEN AT STATE SCHOOL 
NO IT DOESN'T IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE YOU SAID IT DOES HAPPEN THERE 
I KNOW THIS HAS NOTHING WELL IT DOES WHEN WE WERE OUTSIDE 
YOU SAID TO ME WHAT SHOW ARE YOU HERE FOR AND I SAID THE SHOW ABOUT CLASS 
YOU SAID I CAN TELL I SAID HOW YOU SAID LOOK AT THE WAY YOU AND YOUR FRIEND DRESS 
AM I LYING YEAH YOU THOUGHT I LIVED IN CHELSEA AS WELL 
YOU'VE GOT THE CHELSEA LOOK IT'S A COMPLIMENT ONE MINUTE 
THE CHELSEA LOOK YOU WERE LIKE YOU LOOK LIKE A CHELSEA GIRL 
EVEN IF MEANT NO OFFENCE BY THAT 
IT MIGHT BE A COMPLIMENT AND I TOOK 
I WAS BEING NICE I COULD'VE SAID YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE FROM ACTON 
I KNOW AND I'M NOT OFFENDED BY IT 
THERE'S SOME VERY SOLID PEOPLE IN ACTON I'M NOT OFFENDED BY IT 
BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T NEGATIVE THAT IS JUDGMENT 
BY YOU LOOKING AT ME AND SAYING YOU LOOK LIKE A CHELSEA GIRL 
WE DO ALL DO THAT I HAVE TO COME DOWN TO YOU YOUNG LADY COS I HAVEN'T GOT A MIC HERE 
IF YOU SEE A TRAMP YOU DON'T WANNA TALK TO THEM I DO ALL THE TIME 
NO IT'S INTERESTING TO KNOW PEOPLE'S STORIES WELL YOU KNOW 
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO UP TO THEM COS THEY MIGHT ATTACK YOU 
SO THEY'RE LOW DOWN IN THE SOCIAL CLASS SO YOU THINK IT'S A CLASS ORDER 
IF YOU SEE SOMEBODY WHO'S A LOWER CLASS THAN YOU YOU THINK WILL THEY DO SOMETHING TO ME 
NOT JUDGING THEM BUT THAT'S THE WAY YOU ARE IT'S INTIMIDATING 
THERE'S A REASON FOR THE INTIMIDATION THOUGH 
HANG ON A SEC GUYS EXAM TIME FOR YOU ALL GET YOUR PENS READY READY 
CAN YOU TELL A STATE SCHOOL PUPIL FROM A PRIVATE SCHOOL PUPIL WHAT DO YOU THINK NO YES 
LET'S TRY IT FRANK LAMPARD LADIES AND GENTLEMAN 
PRIVATE OR STATE FRANK LAMPARD STATE STATE YOU THINK 
OH O. K. 
ACTUALLY HE'S PRIVATE OOH 
KATE MOSS WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
STATE STATE 
ACTUALLY SHE IS STATE SHE IS STATE AND FINALLY LILY ALLEN 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON PRIVATE 
WELL WE ALL KNOW KEITH ALLEN'S GOT A BIT OF WORTH SO HE IS PRIVATE HOW ABOUT THIS ONE ME 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON STATE STATE 
STATE AND PRIVATE 
I'M A MAN OF THE PEOPLE WHAT CAN I SAY I'M EVERYONE'S FRIEND 
THE QUESTION IS IF YOU'VE GOT TWENTY SIX K. A YEAR YOU CAN BUY AN EDUCATION 
INTO A WORLD MOST OF US CAN ONLY DREAM OF IMAGINE YOUR SCHOOL HAVING THIS GET THIS 
OLYMPIC SIZE POOL TRIPS TO THE FAR EAST 
ART CLASSES WITH UNLIMITED USE OF REAL GOLD LEAF AN EQUESTRIAN CENTRE 
AN EIGHTEEN HOLE GOLF COURSE AND LESSONS ON A SATURDAY YEAH 
LESSONS ON A SATURDAY SOUNDS LIKE A NIGHTMARE NOT SURE THAT'S A GOOD THING 
BUT DOES IT REALLY MATTER WHAT TYPE OF SCHOOL YOU WENT TO 
AND IS IT FAIR THAT IF YOU'VE GOT THE MONEY YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CHOICE OF SCHOOLS 
TIME FOR THOSE LITTLE LADIES HOLLY AND POPPY TO GET PRIVATE WITH THE PUBLIC 
WHAT DO WE THINK DOES MONEY BUY YOU A BETTER EDUCATION THESE DAYS 
OR DO YOU NEED TO EARN YOUR GOLD STARS 
WE CAME TO BRIGHTON TO FIND OUT WHAT THE TEENS REALLY HAD TO SAY CHIP 
NO I GOT MY ROCK 
DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE PRIVATELY EDUCATED I GUESS SOME PEOPLE WHOSE PARENTS 
HAVE HIGH PAYING JOBS THEY DO DESERVE TO GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOL 
I WENT TO PRIVATE SCHOOL BUT 
I DON'T FEEL I HAD A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE OVER EVERYONE ELSE 
JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE MONEY DOESN'T MEAN THEY DESERVE BETTER 
IT'S THEIR CHOICE IF THEY WISH TO GO THERE THEN THAT'S FINE 
SOME STATE SCHOOLS ARE AS GOOD AS NORMAL PRIVATE SCHOOLS 
SO I THINK IT'S FAIR IT'S FINE 
MY BROTHER WENT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL AND HE'S JUST AS NORMAL AS EVERYONE ELSE 
PEOPLE THINK THAT BECAUSE I WENT TO PRIVATE SCHOOL I'M LIKE POSH AND A BIT TOFFEE NOSED 
IF YOU SAY YOU WENT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE JUDGED I THINK 
WOULD YOU SEND YOUR KIDS TO A PRIVATE OR STATE SCHOOL 
I'D PROBABLY CHOOSE TO SEND MY KIDS TO A STATE SCHOOL 
BECAUSE I THINK YOU GET A NICE MIX OF PEOPLE THERE 
SO THERE WE HAVE IT FOLKS PRIVATE SCHOOL OR STATE SCHOOL EDUCATION 
IS IT FAIR NO YOU DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR NOT AT ALL 
MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT PRIVATE SCHOOLS GET TO GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES 
HAVE SO MUCH BETTER EDUCATION LOADS OF THINGS GIVEN TO THEM 
BUT SO DO STATE SCHOOLS 
I HAVE SATURDAY ENGLISH I'VE JUST COME FROM THERE IT'S AMAZING 
WE'VE GOT PEOPLE GETTING E.'S AND D.'S GOING UP TO AS 
I'VE BEEN TO NEPAL AND STAYED IN A FIVE HOTEL ALL I HAD TO PAY WAS ONE HUNDRED 
SO YOUR STATE SCHOOL EDUCATION IS GIVING YOU THESE OPPORTUNITIES I LEARN SIGN LANGUAGE AND JAPANESE 
SO SURELY IT'S FAIR NO BUT THEN YOU GET BETTER TEACHERS 
WE GET BETTER IT'S COS WE'RE IN PRIVATE SCHOOL 
JUST BECAUSE MUMMY AND DADDY HAVE MONEY WHY DO YOU GET BETTER TEACHERS 
WHY DON'T YOU TRY FOR A SCHOLARSHIP DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY SCHOOLS DO THAT 
DO WE THINK THAT'S TRUE NO 
JUST BECAUSE YOU GO TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL DOES THAT MEAN YOU GET A BETTER EDUCATION 
IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE PAID 
IT'S NOT ME BEING UP MY ARSE OR A SNOB IT'S JUST BECAUSE 
SIMPLE MATHEMATICS IF THE TEACHERS ARE GETTING PAID MORE IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS 
IT'S BECAUSE THE PARENTS ARE PAYING SO THEY'LL WORK THERE 
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY FAIR BUT MONEY IS WHAT MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND 
GET RID OF ALL THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND USE THE TWENTY SIX TO THIRTY GRAND A YEAR 
FOR EACH PUPIL THERE TO MAKE THE STATE SCHOOLS BETTER 
THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT CARRY ON MATE 
IF GORDON BROWN HAD THE PEOPLE FROM PRIVATE SCHOOLS 
SHOVED ON HIM IN THE STATE SYSTEM THERE WOULD BE HUGE PROBLEMS 
THERE AREN'T ENOUGH STATE SCHOOLS FOR THAT THE PRIVATE SYSTEM 
ENABLES BUILD MORE BUILD MORE SCHOOLS 
GET THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS TO BECOME STATE SCHOOLS 
HOW WOULD THEY DO THAT O. K. 
LOTS OF THEM ARE TRUSTS THEY WORK ON PROFIT CAN I JUST SAY 
THEY'RE NOT GONNA TURN STATE 
CAN I TALK NOW HANG ON ONE SECOND GO AHEAD 
SELECTIVE SCHOOLS THEY'RE BRILLIANT 
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GO THERE FOR FREE BUT BECAUSE 
WE'RE NOT IN CLASS YOU DON'T NEED TO RAISE YOUR HAND I'LL COME ROUND TO YOU IN A SEC CARRY ON 
WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT CLEVER YOU GO TO A NORMAL SCHOOL 
HOW ABOUT YOU HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT 
DO YOU THINK THAT PRIVATE AND STATE EDUCATION IS FAIR 
I'M PROUD TO SAY THIS BUT I WENT TO A SCHOOL THAT WHEN I SAY THE NAME 
MOST OF YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT IT JUST 
COS IT'S JUST A NORMAL STATE SCHOOL ONE OF THE BOYS IN MY YEAR 
HE CAME FIFTH IN ENGLAND WITH HIS GCSE GRADES 
SO THE EDUCATION HE RECEIVED AT THAT STATE SCHOOL WAS JUST AS GOOD 
SURELY IT DOESN'T MATTER HANG ON A SECOND GO AHEAD 
IT DOES MATTER IF YOU ALL TALK AT ONCE I CAN'T HEAR IT MAKE THAT POINT AGAIN 
JUST COS THEY GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOL IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE NECESSARILY CLEVERER 
THE FACT THAT HE WAS A VERY CLEVER CHILD DOESN'T MEAN 
SHE'S TRYING TO TELL YOU IT DOESN'T MATTER PUBLIC OR STATE SCHOOL 
YOU CAN STILL ACHIEVE THE SAME GRADES NO DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER 
BUT YOU YOU PUT DOWN A PRIVATE SCHOOL ON YOUR C. V. 
AND YOU PUT SOMEBODY ON A STATE SCHOOL NAH 
JUST A MINUTE HANG ON ONE SECOND HANG ON ONE SECOND SO 
ALL THE PEOPLE IF ME AND HIM WAS TO GO FOR A JOB AND HE PUTS DOWN A PRIVATE SCHOOL ON HIS C. V. 
AND I PUT DOWN A STATE SCHOOL HE'S GONNA GET IT COS THAT'S HOW IT IS 
YES I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY O. K. LET ME JUST GET A REPLY 
LET ME GET A REPLY COS OTHERWISE YOU'LL MISS THE DEBATE GO 
THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION IF YOU PUT DOWN A STATE SCHOOL 
I PUT DOWN A PRIVATE SCHOOL WHO'S GONNA LOOK AS IF THEY'VE WORKED HARDER TO GET THERE 
THE PERSON WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES BEING COCOONED IN PRIVILEGE 
OR THE PERSON WHO WENT TO THE STATE SCHOOL 
GOOD POINT I SEE YOUR POINT 
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS 
DO YOU GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOL FIRST OF ALL YEAH YOU DO AND DO YOU FEEL IT'S FAIR 
THE DIVIDE I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR 
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T GO TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL BUT IT'S NOT FAIR 
BUT I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WHERE WOULD YOU SEND YOUR CHILDREN IF I COULD AFFORD IT 
I'D SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL BUT I DON'T THINK WHY 
BUT EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT FAIR 
YEAH BUT I'M SELFISH HUMANS ARE SELFISH 
WHY IS IT NOT FAIR 
IT'S FAIR IF YOU CAN PAY FOR IT GUYS GO AHEAD 
IF YOU CAN PAY FOR IT THEN YOU PAY FOR IT IF YOU CAN'T 
THEN TOUGH LUCK YOU CAN'T IT'S NOT FAIR 
CAN I SAY LOOK ONCE AGAIN 
HANG ON A SECOND RIGHT NOW I'M AT RISK OF SOUNDING LIKE A SNOB 
I'VE BEEN TO STATE AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS THERE'S PROS AND CONS TO BOTH BUT 
I KNOW THAT IF YOU SEE MY SCHOOL ON MY C. V. THEY'LL THINK OOH VERY NICE LOVELY 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT SOD IT IT'S GONNA HELP AND IT DOES YOU KNOW 
NO NO IT'S NOT NICE 
HANG ON A SEC GO 
IT'S NOT NICE IT'S NOT NICE THAT I'D GET MORE OPPORTUNITY 
COS OF THE NAME BUT IT'S LIFE AND YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT THEN THEY CAN AFFORD IT 
IF YOU CAN'T THEN TOUGH LUCK THE WORLD IS UNFAIR 
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT ATTITUDE GO AHEAD REPLY TO HER 
WELL THAT IS QUITE SNOBBISH THE WORLD IS UNFAIR 
AT RISK OF SOUNDING QUITE SNOBBISH YOU DO I'M SORRY 
I GO TO STATE SCHOOL YEAH AND I KNOW IF I PUT IT DOWN ON MY C. V. 
THAT I'VE OPENED DOORS I GO TO THE BRITS SCHOOL WHICH IS GOVERNMENT FUNDED 
MOST OF THE MONEY COMES FROM THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS 
I FEEL THAT I'VE GONE TO THIS STATE SCHOOL AND I'M DOING JUST AS WELL 
AS SOMEONE WHO'S GONE TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL 
IT'S COMPLETELY DOWN TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHETHER YOU'RE DETERMINED TO WORK HARD ENOUGH 
I'VE GOT IF YOU'RE DETERMINED TO WORK HARD YOU'LL GET THE GRADES 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SCHOOL YOU GO TO IF YOU WANNA PUT THE TIME AND EFFORT IN THEN YOU'LL SUCCEED 
A BRILLIANT YOUNG MAN I WON'T MENTION HIS NAME MY MUM TAUGHT HIM 
AND HE WENT FROM A STATE SCHOOL VERY HUMBLE BEGINNINGS 
TO BECOME AN EXTREMELY WELL RESPECTED BARRISTER AND LAWYER 
SO THERE WE HAVE IT THIS YOUNG MAN APPLIED HIMSELF AND DID VERY WELL FOR HIMSELF
