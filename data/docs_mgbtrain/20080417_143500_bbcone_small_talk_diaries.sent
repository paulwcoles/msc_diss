DO YOU EVER WONDER WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A BUG 
WELL YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT 
THIS INCREDIBLE INVENTION IS THE TRANSLATION LENS 
IT CAN TRANSLATE THE THOUGHTS OF SMALL CREATURES 
INTO LANGUAGE WE CAN UNDERSTAND 
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY DEVICE 
I HAD NO IDEA HUMANS WERE SO INTELLIGENT 
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD IT'S LIFE BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT 
PREPARE FOR THE TRIP OF A LIFETIME WITH THE TRAVELLERS 
IF YOU'RE GOING ON A TRIP THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO TRAVEL 
LIKE A DRAGONFLY 
COOLEST WAY OF GETTING FROM A TO B. 
FLYING CHECK THIS OUT 
I'VE GOT FOUR POWERFUL WINGS 
HELP ME CUT AND SLICE THROUGH THE AIR 
IT MEANS I CAN STOP 
JUST LIKE THAT 
HOVER 
THROW A COUPLE OF SHAPES 
CHECK OUT ME COLOURS LADIES 
THEN IT'S ZERO TO THIRTY IN UNDER TWO SECONDS 
THAT IS NO LIE 
OR I CAN JUST KICK BACK AND GLIDE IF I WANT 
FLYING IS LIKE THE BEST THING EVER 
YOU'RE DEAD RIGHT MATE CHECK OUT THIS TANDEM FLYING 
LOOK THERE'S TWO DOUBLE POWER DOUBLE SPEED 
YOU'RE EAVY WHAT D'YA HAVE FOR LUNCH 
WHERE ARE WE GOING WE GO RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT 
OH THIS IS MORE LIKE DOUBLE TROUBLE 
WHATEVER I'M OFF 
SEE US DRAGONFLIES CAN FLY THOUSANDS OF MILES RIGHT 
WE CAN FLY OVER WHOLE OCEANS IF WE LIKE 
WITH A STRONG WIND BEHIND US WE CAN TRAVEL AT ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. 
THAT IS NO LIE AND THAT IS WHY FLYING IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRAVEL 
ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS WRONG 
FLYING 
ONE WORD OVERRATED 
WELL THAT COULD BE TWO WORDS 
EITHER WAY FLYING IS A TOTAL WASTE OF RESOURCES 
WITH THE ENERGY IT TAKES TO KEEP ONE DRAGONFLY IN THE AIR 
YOU COULD KEEP HUNDREDS OF US WOODLICE GOING 
FLYING IT'LL NEVER CATCH ON 
I ZE HUMMINGBIRD HAWK MOTH CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT I AM HEARING 
FLYING MAY TAKE A LOT OF ENERGY 
BUT ENERGY IS NECESSARY HOW ELSE COULD I HAVE FLOWN ACROSS 
THE CHANNEL FROM FRANCE 
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO WALK 
IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING 
OF COURSE THE WOODLOUSE DOES NOT USE MUCH ENERGY 
HE DOESN'T NEED TO HE NEVER GOES NOWHERE 
FLYING WOULD BE WASTED ON HIM 
WHO SAYS I WANT TO GO ANYWHERE 
ALL THAT FLAPPING LOOKS LIKE EFFORT TO ME 
OF COURSE IT IS A LOT OF EFFORT IF WE NEVER DO NOTHING 
THAT TAKES EFFORT WE NEVER DO NOTHING 
SO WHAT IF I HAVE TO SPEND MOST OF MY LIFE REFUELLING 
IT IS WORTH IT TO BE ABLE TO FLY WHERE I WANT AND HOW I WANT 
HOLD ON YOU SPEND MOST OF YOUR LIFE LOOKING FOR FOOD 
THAT YOU ONLY NEED COS YOU'RE ALWAYS FLYING 
THAT'S JUST PLAIN BARMY 
I COULD WALK THOUSANDS OF MILES ON THE ENERGY FROM A FEW SULTANAS 
HAVE YOU GOT A SULTANA WELL NO I HAVEN'T 
IF I DID I COULD ANYWAY WHY WOULD YOU TRAVEL ROUND THE WORLD 
WHEN YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE LEAVES HERE 
WINGS I WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE THEM IF THEY CAME WITH FREE POO 
I REALLY LIKE POO 
I'VE GOT TO AGREE WITH THE LOUSE 
I'VE GOT WINGS BUT US COCKROACHES DON'T USE THEM MUCH 
THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY IT WOULD TAKE TO LIFT A BIG LASS LIKE MYSELF 
JUST ISN'T WORTH IT 
MIND OUT ROACHIE 
WHERE I LIVE WHAT'S THE USE OF FLYING 
YOU CAN'T FLY UNDER A TOASTER OR BEHIND THE FRIDGE 
WHERE ALL THE CRUMBS ARE 
JUST COS YOU DON'T FLY DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE SLOW 
I CAN TRAVEL FIFTEEN TIMES MY OWN BODY LENGTH IN ONE SECOND WAH 
MIND OUT ROACHIE 
WALKING AND RUNNING MAKES SENSE WHEN YOU'RE INDOORS 
BUT IT'S NO FUN IS IT 
FLYING'S A BUZZ WATCH THIS 
EH WA HEY 
FLYING BLUE BOTTLE STYLE EH 
HA HA HA HA 
YOU TELL ME WALKING IS AS MUCH FUN AS THIS

OH CRAZY 
PRETTY FLY FOR A FLY 
BET ME I WON'T FLY STRAIGHT INTO THAT WALL GO ON 
OH 
OH IT DIDN'T HURT I'M SO LIGHT I JUST BOUNCE OFF 
HA HA HA 
I'M CREAM CRACKERED 
A PITY THERE ISN'T ANOTHER WAY OF FLYING 
THAT DOESN'T TAKE IT OUT OF YOU SO MUCH 
THERE IS JUMPING GRASSHOPPERS CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT 
WATCH THIS 
THREE TWO ONE 
WOAH HO HO HO 
IT'S LIKE FLYING ONLY WITHOUT THE WINGS 
SO WE DON'T TIRE OURSELVES OUT WITH ALL THAT FLAPPING 
MUCH LESS ENERGY INVOLVED IN A GOOD JUMP 
DON'T MEAN IT AIN'T IMPRESSIVE 
I KNOW A CRICKET THAT CAN JUMP FOUR METRES 
YOU CAN ESCAPE A WHOLE HEAP OF TROUBLE IF YOU CAN JUMP FOUR METRES 
I TELL YE 
WOAH 
WOAH HEY HEY HEY 
OH OH NO 
ARGH 
OH OH 
OH OH 
WHERE AM I 
YOU MIGHT EVEN LAND IN THE WATER 
WEH 
IF YOU'RE QUICK ENOUGH YOU CAN JUMP OUT AGAIN BEFORE YOU SINK 
YOU COULD FIND YOURSELF LEAPING FROM THE FRYING PAN 
INTO THE FIRE I HEARD ABOUT ONE FELLA 
JUMPED RIGHT INTO A SPIDER'S WEB 
DON'T PANIC DON'T PANIC 
IF I MOVE SHE'LL HAVE ME 
ARE YOU STOPPING BY FOR LUNCH NO I'VE ALREADY EATEN 
TWANG 
PHEW 
THAT WAS CLOSE JUMPING'S DANGEROUS BUT 
YOU CAN'T STAY AT HOME YOUR WHOLE LIFE CAN YOU 
SO YOU DECIDED TO JOIN ME AFTER ALL OH 
ACTUALLY YOU CAN STAY AT HOME YOUR WHOLE LIFE 
IF YOU'RE A SNAIL AND YOU TAKE YOUR HOME WITH YOU 
LOOK MINE DOUBLES AS A HANDY CRASH HELMET 
TRAVELLING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DANGEROUS AT ALL 
NOT IF YOU BRING YOUR OWN SAFETY EQUIPMENT 
HERE I AM RACING INTO PERIL 
THERE'S A CHASM AHEAD 
LOOK OUT I'M GOING OVER 
OH 
AM I NO I'M NOT 
I'LL JUST EXTEND MY HEAD AND STICK IT TO THE OTHER SIDE 
THEN BRING ME BODY SLOWLY ACROSS 
FOR SAFE TRAVEL THE THING YOU SHOULD NEVER BE WITHOUT 
IS A NICE THICK MUCOUS TRAIL NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT ONE 
I CAN USE MINE TO SLIDE DOWN THIS BOTTLE EASIEST 
THING IN THE WORLD THAT WAS CLOSE 
TO BE HONEST I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
WHY MOST ANIMALS DON'T HAVE A MUCOUS TRAIL 
I'VE SEEN HUMANS WIPING AWAY THEIRS WITH A HANDKERCHIEF 
WHAT A WASTE 
IT'S SO USEFUL I USE MY MUCOUS TO WALK OVER BROKEN GLASS 
AND IT DOESN'T HURT 
DON'T TRY IT WITH YOURS THOUGH MINE'S A LOT THICKER 
IT'S THE ULTIMATE IN ALL TERRAIN TRAVEL 
I CAN GO ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE 
WELL EXCEPT OVER SALT 
AND WATER AND SAND I DON'T LIKE 
I'M NOT THAT KEEN ON WOOD SHAVINGS EITHER 
THERE GOES THE SNAIL MOANING AGAIN 
HE SHOULD TRY TO TRAVEL THE WAY US WORMS DO IT 
WE'VE GOT OUR OWN METHOD I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'D CALL IT 
TUNNELLING CAN'T CALL IT TUNNELLING COS SOMETIMES I DO IT ABOVE GROUND 
HOW ABOUT PUMPING PUMPING'S CLOSE 
BUT IT IGNORES THE MOST IMPORTANT PART 
I MAY LOOK SMOOTH BUT I'M COVERED IN LITTLE BRISTLES 
THEY'RE WHAT I USE TO GRIP AS I TRAVEL 
I STICK THEM IN THE EARTH THEN I PULL MYSELF ALONG 
MAYBE I SHOULD CALL IT PULLING THESE SPIKES GIVE ME SUCH A FIRM GRIP 
I CAN PUSH MY WAY THROUGH ANYTHING 
HANG ON MAYBE IT'S PUSHING NO PULLING 
YOU KNOW WHAT THERE'S NOT A WORD FOR WHAT I DO 
LET'S CALL IT WORMING 
I LIKE THAT IT SAYS IT ALL 
WORMING YOUR WAY ALONG ABOVE GROUND CAN BE DANGEROUS 
THERE'S PLENTY OF BADGERS AND HEDGEHOGS 
WHO SEE A WORM AS A MOVING SAUSAGE 
THEY MOVE SO FAST WITH THOSE LEGS I DON'T STAND A CHANCE 
I GUESS IF I LIVED ABOVE GROUND ALL THE TIME I'D WANT LEGS 
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT A WORM WITH LEGS WOULD LOOK LIKE 
RIDICULOUS 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN RIDICULOUS HOW DARE YOU 
A WORM WITH LEGS WOULD LOOK LIKE ME A MILLIPEDE 
I'VE GOT SEVENTY I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE TROD IN BUT THIS TASTES FANTASTIC 
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW THESE LEGS WORK IT'S A MILITARY OPERATION 
MY FIRST LEFT LEG MOVES AND SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE SECOND ONE 
WHICH SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE THIRD ONE AND SO ON 
OBVIOUSLY THIS HAPPENS QUICKER THAN I CAN EXPLAIN OR I'D FALL OVER 
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE 
WHEN ALL SEVENTY LEGS ARE WORKING 
IT'S LIKE A MEXICAN WAVE ON EACH SIDE OF MY BODY 
POETRY IN MOTION 
NOW I'VE MASTERED THE MEXICAN WAVE 
I'LL TRY SOMETHING MORE ADVENTUROUS TAP DANCING 
THINK OF THE SHOES 
O. K. O. K. SO FLYING AIN'T THE ONLY WAY OF GETTING ABOUT BIG DEAL 
HOW DO YOU WALKERS JUMPERS OR CRAWLERS GET ACROSS WATER 
YOU CAN'T YOU HAVE TO GO THE LONG WAY ROUND LOSERS 
IF YOU CAN FLY YOU JUST FLY ACROSS 
PUDDLE POND RIVER LAKE SEA OCEAN IT DON'T MATTER 
WALKERS NO CHANCE 
LEGS AND WATER DON'T MIX FACT 
WINGS HUM 
I DO BEG TO DIFFER I'VE MADE RATHER A HABIT OUT OF WALKING ON WATER 
LOOK WE CAN RUN ABOUT ON WATER AS MUCH AS WE LIKE 
WE NEVER EVEN GET OUR LEGS WET 
AREN'T WE TERRIBLY CLEVER JUST SKATING ON PONDS 
YES THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME A POND SKATER 
TERRIBLY UNORIGINAL NAME IF YOU ASK ME 
SUCH GRACE SUCH ARTISTRY 
IT'S THE SURFACE TENSION OF THE WATER 
AND THE SPECIAL HAIRS ON OUR LEGS THAT HELP KEEP US AFLOAT 
THERE IS ONE MINOR PROBLEM 
OH DEAR IT'S HAPPENING NOW BATTEN DOWN THE HATCHES 
THERE'S A GENTLE BREEZE OOOOOH 
LOOK OUT I'M BEING BLOWN BACK THE WAY I CAME 
OH HO HO 
WIND DURING LUNCH HOW TERRIBLY INCONVENIENT 
LOOK OUT WHOA 
OOPS SORRY DON'T MENTION IT 
IT'S VERY HARD TO STAY IN CONTROL WHEN YOU ARE SO LIGHT 
IMAGINE BEING MADE OF PAPER AND TRYING TO WALK IN A GA A A LE 
O. K. FAIR ENOUGH I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS INSECTS COULD WALK ON WATER 
THAT IS PRETTY COOL WHATEVER 
YOU SEE THAT'S WHY WALKING IS THE BEST IT'S VERSATILE 
THERE'S SOME CAN WALK UPSIDE DOWN FAST SOME CAN WALK ON WATER 
AND THERE'S SOME CAN JUMP 
THERE'S SOME LIKE ME WHO USE UP VIRTUALLY NO ENERGY 
I COULD TRAVEL TO PLACES THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY 
IF I COULD MANAGE TO WALK IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
FOR MORE THAN A FEW CENTIMETRES 
NINETY NINE ONE HUNDRED READY OR NOT HERE I COME 
OH I'M DIZZY 
HOLD ON YOU CAN'T WALK IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
THAT IS SAD 
YEAH O. K. I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT EARLIER 
I'M BORN WITH THE URGE TO KEEP TURNING 
I CAN'T HELP MESELF 
THE GOOD THING IS I ALWAYS SEARCH THOROUGHLY FOR FOOD 
AND I NEVER GO FAR FROM HOME SO I DON'T GET LOST 
ON THE OTHER HAND 
I DO HAVE A LIMITED EXPERIENCE OF FOREIGN CLIMES 
LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT I WITH ME SUPER GREEDY ENERGY SYSTEM 
THAT YOU THINK IS RUBBISH STILL MANAGE TO TRAVEL ACROSS OCEANS 
AND YOU MR. ENERGY EFFICIENCY WHERE DID YOU GO ON HOLIDAY 
JUST OVER THERE I GUESS THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH EVERY KIND OF TRAVEL 
IF YOU FLY IT TAKES ENERGY 
IF YOU JUMP YOU MIGHT BE JUMPING INTO DANGER 
IF YOU CRAWL YOU COULD GET EATEN 
IF YOU SKATE YOU GET BLOWN AND IF YOU SLIDE YOU NEVER GO VERY FAR 
THAT'S THE THING ABOUT TRAVELLING YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING 
YOU CAN TRAVEL TO EXOTIC PARTS OR CONSERVE ENERGY 
YOU CAN BE SLOW AND SAFE OR FAST AND IN DANGER 
OH WELL I GUESS IT'S EACH TO THEIR OWN 
OH 
A BELLY FLO O. O. OP 
WOAH 
HEE HEE RIGHT IN THE BUTTERCUPS 
BELLY FLOP WORKS BETTER ON WATER 
YEE 
SAVED BY THE HIND LEGS
