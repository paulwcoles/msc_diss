COMING OUT WEST TO HUNT WOLVES WAS AN IMPULSE THING 
I NEVER IMAGINED IT WOULD CHANGE MY LIFE 
IN THE AUTUMN OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY THREE A MAN CALLED ERNEST THOMPSON SETON CAME TO NEW MEXICO 
THESE WERE THE DYING DAYS OF THE OLD WILD WEST 
AND SETON'S MISSION WAS TO HUNT DOWN THE LAST OF THE OUTLAWS 
THE OUTLAW WOLVES 
BUT WHAT BEGAN AS A TWO WEEK JOB TURNED INTO AN EPIC DUEL 
A DUEL THAT WOULD TOUCH SETON'S HEART 
AND ONE WHICH IN THE END 
HELPED TO CHANGE FOREVER AMERICA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS WILDERNESS 
AND IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF ONE REMARKABLE ANIMAL 
WHEN I WAS A BOY OF TEN I WAS GIVEN THIS BOOK 
WILD ANIMALS I HAVE KNOWN BY ERNEST THOMPSON SETON 
AND IT HAD A HUGE EFFECT UPON ME 
SETON WAS A TRAPPER NATURALIST WORKING ON THE PRAIRIES OF NORTH AMERICA 
AND HIS FIRST STORY IS ABOUT LOBO A WOLF THAT HE WAS HIRED TO TRAP 
AND IT SHOWS WOLVES TO BE BRAVE FEARLESS TOUCHINGLY LOYAL TO ONE ANOTHER 
I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN IT 
THE STAGE FOR THE DRAMA COULD HARDLY BE WIDER OR MORE EPIC 
NEW MEXICO IN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST 
IS A LAND WHERE THE ROLLING PRAIRIES MEET THE FOOTHILLS OF THE ROCKIES 
BY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY THREE THE YEAR SETON CAME TO HUNT WOLVES 
THIS WAS A LAND BEING SWEPT BY PROFOUND CHANGE 
THE MODERN WORLD WAS STEAMING IN 
SETTLERS WERE ARRIVING BY THE TRAIN LOAD 
WHAT HAD RECENTLY BEEN THE LAND OF THE APACHE AND THE BUFFALO 
WAS NOW THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY 
LIVESTOCK WERE POURING IN 
RANCHING WAS BIG BUSINESS 
BUT THE OLD WEST HADN'T COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED 
PARTS OF NORTHERN NEW MEXICO WERE STILL UNTAMED 
IN THE REMOTE CURRUMPAW VALLEY WILD WOLVES STILL ROAMED THE CANYONS 
A VICIOUS WAR WAS UNDER WAY TO EXTERMINATE THE LAST OF THESE CATTLE KILLERS 
ONE OF THESE WOLVES HOWEVER SEEMED TO POSSESS AN ALMOST SUPERNATURAL ABILITY TO CHEAT DEATH 
SETON SOON HEARD ABOUT THIS SUPER WOLF FROM THE COWBOYS 
HE WAS KNOWN AS LOBO 
KING OF THE CURRUMPAW 
LOBO AND HIS BAND OF OUTLAWS WERE BLAMED FOR KILLING HUNDREDS OF CATTLE 
AND NOT SURPRISINGLY THE CATTLE BARONS AND THEIR COWBOYS WANTED HIM DEAD 
IN MANY WAYS SETON WAS THE PERFECT ASSASSIN 
HE'D HUNTED WOLVES FOR BOUNTY MONEY BEFORE 
AND WRITTEN A MANUAL FOR HIS FELLOW TRAPPERS ON HOW TO CATCH THEM 
HE EVEN CLAIMED THAT ONE OF HIS SCOTTISH ANCESTORS HAD WIPED OUT 
THE LAST REMAINING WOLVES IN THE BRITISH ISLES 
BUT BEHIND THE GUN LAY A MORE COMPLEX CHARACTER 
SETON WAS A NATURALIST WHO'D GROWN UP IN THE BACKWOODS OF CANADA 
WITH A REAL LOVE AND FASCINATION FOR NATURE 
HE WAS ALSO AN ARTIST 
TRAINED IN PARIS AND LONDON 
WHOSE FAVOURITE SUBJECTS WERE THE WILD ANIMALS OF NORTH AMERICA 
THE STORY OF THE HUNT FOR LOBO IS THE STORY OF A DIVIDED MAN 
ON THE ONE HAND A ROMANTIC WHOSE HEART WAS WITH THE WILDERNESS AND ITS WILD CREATURES 
AND ON THE OTHER A HIRED HUNTER WHO LIKE THE COWBOYS 
SAW WOLVES AS SOMEHOW DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER ANIMALS 
AS WANTON KILLERS THAT HAD TO BE DEALT WITH 
I AM TO GET BOARD AND LODGING ALL EXPENSES AND BOUNTY MONIES 
IN EXCHANGE FOR WHICH I SHALL RID THE COWBOYS OF THEIR DEMON WOLF 
I THINK TWO WEEKS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO CATCH THE PEST 
LITTLE DID SETON KNOW THE REMARKABLE WOLF HE WAS UP AGAINST 
THE WILD AND ROMANTIC STORY THAT FOLLOWS 
IS BASED ENTIRELY ON THE JOURNAL THAT SETON KEPT AT THE TIME 
AND THE BOOK HE SUBSEQUENTLY WROTE 
IT IS ACCORDING TO SETON ALMOST COMPLETELY TRUE 
THE ANIMALS HE LATER WROTE 
WERE REAL CHARACTERS WHO LIVED THE LIVES I HAVE DEPICTED 
AND YET SETON MADE SUCH SURPRISING ALMOST HEROIC CLAIMS ABOUT LOBO AND HIS PACK 
THAT WE'RE BOUND TO WONDER HOW MUCH OF IT WE CAN REALLY BELIEVE 
A DREAD OF THIS LOBO HAS SPREAD AMONG THE RANCHMEN 
AND NOW THE PRICE SET ON HIS HEAD IS A THOUSAND DOLLARS 
A RECORD BOUNTY FOR A WOLF 
HE IS MY NUMBER ONE TARGET 
SETON HAD COME TO NEW MEXICO 
EQUIPPED TO A WAGE A POISON CAMPAIGN 
A TRIED AND TESTED METHOD FROM HIS WOLF HUNTING DAYS IN CANADA 
A PIECE OF MEAT LACED WITH A FEW DROPS OF STRYCHNINE 
MAKES A GOOD WOLF BAIT 
THE POISON CAUSES VIOLENT SPASMS 
AND THE VICTIM SOON DIES OF ASPHYXIATION 
BUT IT'S CRUCIAL THAT THE BAIT IS FREE FROM THE TAINT OF METAL OR ANY TRACE OF HUMAN SCENT 
OR THE WOLF WILL GET SUSPICIOUS AND AVOID IT 
IT WAS LATE OCTOBER SETON SET ABOUT LAYING HIS FIRST BAITS 
OVER THE FOLLOWING DAYS 
HE MADE A SERIES OF WIDE CIRCUITS AROUND THE PLAINS 
DROPPING A PIECE OF POISONED MEAT EVERY SO OFTEN 
TAKING CARE NOT TO TOUCH THEM WITH HIS HANDS OR TO GET OFF HIS HORSE 
SETON THE MAN WHO'D WRITTEN THE TEXTBOOK ON HOW TO CATCH A WOLF 
WAS CONFIDENT THAT HIS EXPERTLY PREPARED BAITS WOULD SOON BRING HIM HIS THOUSAND DOLLAR BOUNTY 
ALONGSIDE HIS HUNT FOR LOBO SETON ALSO PURSUED HIS LOVE OF NATURE 
TAKING EVERY CHANCE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE WILD INHABITANTS OF THE CURRUMPAW 
AT FIRST THIS PLACE SEEMED UNINVITING 
COMPARED TO THE LUSH PRAIRIES OF MANITOBA 
BUT THE MORE I EXPLORE THE MORE I REALISE IT'S A PARADISE 
EVERY SPINY BUSH IS TEEMING WITH LIFE AND EVERY DAY I MAKE NEW FRIENDS AND LEARN NEW FACTS 
I WAS AMAZED TO SEE THE PRAIRIE CHICKENS STILL DANCING IN THE FALL 
PROVIDED THEY'RE FAT AND FIT 
THEY SEEM TO LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN A SHIMMY 
THEY SHARE THE PLAINS WITH HUNDREDS OF PRAIRIE DOGS 
AND AS FAR AS I CAN SEE 
THESE LITTLE YAP RATS NEVER GO MORE THAN A HUNDRED YARDS FROM HOME 
EVERY BURROW'S A PLUNGE HOLE 
A SHEER DROP FOR RAPID ESCAPE 
SETON THE NATURALIST MAY HAVE BEEN CRAMMING HIS NOTEBOOKS WITH OBSERVATIONS 
BUT HIS HUNT FOR LOBO WAS ABOUT TO SUFFER A HUMILIATING SETBACK 
NOVEMBER THIRD 
I SET OUT IN THE AFTERNOON TO CHECK MY BAITS AND SOON PICKED UP LOBO'S TRACKS 
HIS MONSTROUS PAW PRINT IS UNMISTAKABLE 
IT MEASURES OVER FIVE INCHES FROM CLAW TO HEEL 
WHICH MUST PUT HIM AT AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY POUNDS 
FURTHER AHEAD I FOUND THAT LOBO HAD COME TO ONE OF MY BAITS 
SNIFFED AT IT AND THEN PICKED IT UP 
I GALLOPED ON WITH EAGER EYES EXPECTING TO FIND HIM DEAD WITHIN A MILE 
A SECOND BAIT HAD BEEN TAKEN AND THEN A THIRD 
BUT THOUGH I SCANNED THE BRUSH I SAW NOTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A DEAD WOLF 
AT THE FOURTH BAIT I DISCOVERED THAT LOBO HADN'T REALLY 
TAKEN MY BAITS AT ALL BUT HAD MERELY CARRIED THEM IN HIS MOUTH 
THEN HAVING PILED THE THREE BAITS ON TOP OF THE FOURTH 
HE'D SCATTERED FILTH OVER THEM 
TO EXPRESS HIS UTTER CONTEMPT FOR MY DEVICES 
DESCRIPTIONS LIKE THIS SEEM FAR FETCHED 
JUST HOW CLEVER ARE WOLVES 
COULD LOBO REALLY HAVE PLAYED A JOKE ON SETON 
SINCE SETON'S TIME WE'VE LEARNT A LOT MORE ABOUT WOLF BEHAVIOUR 
TODAY YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK SUPPORTS A THRIVING POPULATION 
OF WILD WOLVES WHICH ARE CLOSELY MONITORED BY SCIENTISTS 
WITH OVER TWENTY YEARS' EXPERIENCE OF TRACKING AND STUDYING WOLVES 
DOUG SMITH IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERTS 
AND UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO ASSESS WHAT SETON WROTE 
SETON WAS IMPUTING THESE POWERS OF RIDICULE TO THE WOLVES 
THAT REALLY ARE BEYOND THEM 
WOLVES REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT US 
BUT IT'S WELL KNOWN AMONG WOLF BIOLOGISTS 
THAT WHEN YOU TRAP AND CATCH WOLVES A LOT THEY GET EDUCATED 
YOU TEACH THEM HOW TO AVOID YOU CATCHING THEM 
THE WOLVES THAT WERE LEFT WERE GETTING EDUCATED 
BY THE TRAPS AND THE GUNS AND THE POISON THAT PEOPLE WERE USING TO KILL THEM 
WHAT SETON ENCOUNTERED 
IN SOME WAYS WAS THE BEST OF THE BEST 
SETON HAD COME TO NEW MEXICO AS A HIRED GUN TO DO A DIRTY JOB 
EXPECTING TO STAY FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
BUT LOBO CONTINUED TO ELUDE HIM 
AND AS THE WEEKS STRETCHED INTO MONTHS 
THE UNTAMED BEAUTY OF THE LAND BEGAN TO CAST ITS SPELL 
HE WAS FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE WEST 
HE WAS ALSO LEARNING OF THE OLD DAYS WHEN THE WILD GAME ABOUNDED 
AND THE WILDERNESS WAS UNSPOILED 
I CAN USUALLY RECKON ON 
SEEING A DOZEN OR MORE PRONGHORN ON THE PLAINS 
BUT EVERYONE SAYS THAT THESE BANDS ARE NOTHING COMPARED WITH 
THE HUGE HERDS OF DAYS GONE BY 
THIS LAND IS VAST 
BUT BEYOND THESE HORIZONS 
AMERICA IS BUSY GROWING LIKE AN UGLY OVERFED BRAT 
TOO HEALTHY TO SLOW DOWN TOO YOUNG AND AMBITIOUS TO CARE ABOUT 
WHAT IT DESTROYS ALONG THE WAY 
IN THE CURRUMPAW SETON HAD PLENTY OF TIME 
TO THINK ABOUT AMERICA'S DWINDLING WILDLIFE 
ONLY A FEW YEARS EARLIER THERE HAD STILL BEEN BUFFALO ON THE PLAINS 
ONE OF THE COWBOYS SAW A SMALL HERD 
NOT FAR FROM HERE IN EIGHTY EIGHT JUST FIVE WINTERS BACK 
THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE VERY LAST SURVIVORS IN THE ENTIRE SOUTHWEST 
FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS WOLVES HAD SURVIVED 
BY HUNTING ONE OF NORTH AMERICA'S MOST FORMIDABLE PREY SPECIES 
THEY'D PITTED THEIR WITS AGAINST THE SHEER SIZE AND FEROCITY OF THE BUFFALO 
THIS REQUIRED TEAMWORK 
IT WAS LITTLE WONDER THAT WOLVES HAD EVOLVED 
INTO SUCH HIGHLY INTELLIGENT ANIMALS WITH INTIMATE FAMILY BONDS 
AFTER THE BUFFALO A COW WAS A PIECE OF CAKE 
THE WOLF PROBLEM CLEARLY 
IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE CREATED 
FIRST WE ANNIHILATED THE GREAT HERDS OF BUFFALO THAT THE WOLVES DEPENDED ON FOR FOOD 
THEN WE FILLED THE PRAIRIES WITH OUR DEFENSELESS CATTLE 
I AM TOLD THAT LOBO'S BAND ALONE KILLS A COW EVERY DAY 
LOBO'S PACK COULD SLICE THROUGH LIVESTOCK 
LIKE A KNIFE THROUGH BUTTER 
WOLVES PROBABLY COULD HAVE KILLED AS MUCH LIVESTOCK AS SETON DESCRIBED 
LIVESTOCK WAS VULNERABLE AND HELPLESS 
WE'VE BRED THEIR NATURAL DEFENSES OUT OF THEM 
AND WOLVES ARE INTELLIGENT AND THEY HAD FIGURED THAT OUT 
SO WOLVES HAVE A MENTALITY REALLY OF KILL EVERYTHING YOU CAN 
SETON STILL HAD A JOB TO DO 
AND AFTER THE FAILURE OF HIS POISONED BAITS HE NOW BROUGHT OUT A NEW WEAPON 
THE DOUBLE SPRING STEEL WOLF TRAP 
PERHAPS A MORE MUSCULAR APPROACH WOULD DEFEAT THE WILY LOBO 
DARIEN BROWN LIVES TODAY JUST A FEW MILES NORTH OF THE CURRUMPAW 
ON A RANCH WHERE SETON IS KNOWN TO HAVE STAYED 
IN FACT SOME OF SETON'S ACTUAL TRAPS WERE LEFT HERE WITH DARIEN'S GRANDFATHER IN THIS VERY BARN 
NUMBER FOUR WOLF TRAP 
THIS IS ONE OF THE ACTUAL TRAPS THAT SETON USED TO TRY TO CATCH LOBO 
THESE TRAPS ARE DESIGNED TO GRAB AND HOLD THEIR VICTIMS 
RATHER THAN KILL THEM 
I'M GONNA PUT SOME SOFT DIRT IN HERE SO THE TRAP WILL SET JUST RIGHT 
AND ALL THE TIME KEEP IN MIND 
THIS IS A REAL TRAP THAT'D CATCH ME AS WELL AS ANY ANIMAL 
THE WOLF WILL ACTUALLY PUT HIS FOOT ON THIS 
IT'S WHAT TRIGGERS IT TO GO OFF 
NOW I WANT TO KEEP AN OPEN AREA UNDER 
THE TRAP PAN SO THAT WHEN THE ANIMAL STEPS ON IT 
IT'LL ACTUALLY SPRING THE TRAP 
IF YOU HAD DIRT UNDERNEATH IT 
IT WOULDN'T GO OFF IT'D JUST SIT THERE 
NOW A REAL KEY ELEMENT IS TO MAKE THIS 
ABOUT AS NATURAL WITH THE GROUND AROUND IT AS YOU CAN 
O. K. NOTHING EXPOSED 
NOW WE HAVE THE TRAP SET 
AND THOUGH IT'S OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD IT STILL FUNCTIONS PERFECTLY 
IT'S JUST DESIGNED TO CATCH IT 
THEY CAN STILL GET BLOOD CIRCULATION TO THEIR FOOT 
THIS IS ALSO HOOKED TO A DRAG 
AS IT GOES ALONG THE GROUND IT'LL GET CAUGHT IN A CACTUS OR A TREE 
OR ANYTHING ALONG THE WAY 
IT SLOWS THEM UP ENOUGH AND LEAVES A MARK IN THE GROUND 
AND THEN YOU CAN FOLLOW THE ANIMAL 
DECEMBER THIRTEENTH 
THIS AFTERNOON I WENT UP THE WEST CANYON WITH RANCHER BILL ALLEN 
AND WE PUT OUT A DOZEN TRAPS ALONG ONE OF LOBO'S TRAILS 
ALWAYS TAKING CARE TO COVER OUR SCENT AND TRACKS 
CATCHING LOBO WAS BECOMING AN OBSESSION 
SETON SIMPLY DIDN'T SEE WOLVES THE WAY HE SAW OTHER WILD CREATURES 
UNLIKE WOLVES WHICH WERE KILLERS 
ANIMALS LIKE ELK DIDN'T THREATEN ANYONE'S LIVELIHOOD 
ON THE CONTRARY LIKE THE BUFFALO AND THE PRONGHORN 
ELK WERE NOW THEMSELVES IN DECLINE 
THE VICTIMS OF OVER HUNTING BY MAN 
SETON'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH NEW MEXICO WAS DEEPENING BY THE DAY 
IN FACT HIS CONCERN FOR ALL OF NORTH AMERICA'S WILDLIFE 
WAS VERY LIKELY AWAKENING 
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO WOLVES SETON WAS STILL THINKING IN THE OLD WAY 
THROUGHOUT HISTORY WE HAVE DEMONISED WOLVES 
SEEN THEM AS WANTON BLOODTHIRSTY KILLERS 
ALMOST THE EMBODIMENT OF EVIL 
THURSDAY DECEMBER FOURTEENTH 
I RODE OUT TO CHECK MY TRAPS AND SOON CAME UPON LOBO'S TRAIL 
IN THE DUST I COULD READ THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS DOINGS THE PREVIOUS NIGHT 
HE'D RUN ALONG THROUGH THE SCRUB FOR A FEW HUNDRED YARDS 
THEN TURNED TOWARDS MY TRAPS 
BUT UPON REACHING THE FIRST ONE HE'D SCRATCHED UP STONES AND EARTH 
TILL HE'D SPRUNG THE TRAP AND MADE IT SAFE 
CONTINUING ALONG THE TRAIL SETON DISCOVERED THAT LOBO 
HAD DISARMED OVER A DOZEN OF HIS TRAPS IN THE SAME WAY 
HOW COULD HE HAVE SEEN THROUGH SETON'S CLEVER PLAN SO EASILY 
WOLVES ARE VERY VERY OBSERVANT OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT 
THEY PAY ATTENTION TO A DEGREE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME FATHOMING 
THEY'RE JUST EXTREMELY ATTENTIVE 
TO EVERY LITTLE THING IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT 
THEY KNEW SETON WAS AFTER HIM 
AND HIS OTHER COWBOYS 
AND SO THEY BECAME VERY ATTUNED TO HIS TRICKS 
AND ONCE THEY LEARN ABOUT TRAPS ABOUT STEEL 
THEY BECOME HYPER OBSERVANT 
THAT'S ALL THEY'RE DOING 
THE WILY WOLF HAD OUTWITTED SETON ONCE AGAIN 
IT WAS GOING TO BE A LONG WINTER 
WEEK AFTER WEEK I VARY MY METHODS AND REDOUBLE MY PRECAUTIONS 
YET THERE IS ONLY DEFEAT AFTER DEFEAT 
THE COWBOYS COMPLAIN BITTERLY OF THEIR LOSSES 
AND EACH NIGHT OLD LOBO MOCKS ME WITH HIS TRIUMPHANT HOWL 
DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTH WENT IN THE AFTERNOON TO TRAIL WOLVES 
SAW ONLY COYOTES AND JACK RABBITS 
WOLVES HAVE KILLED THREE CATTLE AND A COLT 
CHRISTMAS DAY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY THREE FOUND MANY WOLF TRACKS TODAY BUT CAUGHT NOTHING 
JANUARY FIFTH BITTERLY COLD BAITS UNTOUCHED 
JANUARY THIRTEENTH GOT NOTHING AND SAW NOTHING 
TODAY I HAVE RIDDEN WITHOUT REST OR STOP BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE AND FORTY MILES 
I AM FACING TOTAL HUMILIATION 
AFTER MONTHS OF FAILURE SETON MUST HAVE BEEN AT HIS WITS' END 
HE HADN'T EVEN CLAPPED EYES ON LOBO 
WHAT HE DESPERATELY NEEDED WAS A LUCKY BREAK 
AND EVENTUALLY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE GOT 
I CAMPED OUT ABOVE THE CREEK 
CLOSE TO WHERE THE SNOW GEESE AND CRANES ARE WINTERING 
THEY SPEND THE NIGHTS HUDDLED TOGETHER IN THE MARSH 
BEYOND THE REACH OF THE COYOTES AND THE WOLVES 
IT WAS THE COMMOTION OF THE GEESE 
THAT LED ME TO THE CLUE I SO BADLY NEEDED 
I RECOGNISED LOBO'S MARK INSTANTLY 
AND THEN NOTICED A SECOND SET OF TRACKS 
ALWAYS IT SEEMED RUNNING OUT IN FRONT 
WHEREVER THESE SMALLER TRACKS LED 
OLD LOBO WAS SURE TO FOLLOW LEAPING AND ROLLING IN THE MUD 
SUDDENLY I REALISED WHAT WAS GOING ON 
THE OLD MARAUDER WAS IN LOVE 
SETON KNEW IMMEDIATELY THAT THE SHE WOLF WAS HIS BIG CHANCE 
A CYNICAL NEW PLAN FORMED IN HIS MIND 
DURING THE BREEDING SEASON WHICH APPARENTLY 
A LOT OF HIS STORY TOOK PLACE 
THAT MALE'S TENDING THAT FEMALE EXTREMELY CLOSELY 
HE RARELY LEAVES HER SIDE DURING THAT TIME PERIOD 
I CHASE WOLVES WITH A HELICOPTER IT DOESN'T HURT THEM WE HAVE TO DO IT 
BUT WHEN WE MOVE IN ON 'EM IT'S DURING THE MATING SEASON 
AND YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL WHO'S A BREEDING PAIR 
BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT SEPARATE 
AND SO THEY'RE MOVING AROUND IN THEIR OWN LITTLE ORBIT OF TWO 
AND THE REST OF THE PACK BREAKS UP AND GOES EVERY WHICH WAY 
THAT MALE WOLF THE ALPHA MALE 
STICKS RIGHT WITH THAT FEMALE 
I SOON LEARNT MORE ABOUT LOBO'S MATE FROM THE SHEPHERDS 
THEY CALL HER BLANCA BECAUSE OF HER WHITE COAT 
AND THEY SAY SHE LEADS LOBO A MERRY DANCE 
THIS TALLIES WITH THE TRACKS I SAW AT THE CREEK 
AND HAS SUGGESTED A WAY TO CATCH HER 
CUNNINGLY SETON FIRST PLACED TRAPS RATHER OBVIOUSLY AROUND A DEAD COW 
GUESSING THAT LOBO WOULD STOP AND TRY TO DISARM THEM 
WHILE HE WAS THUS DIVERTED SETON HOPED THAT LOBO'S MATE BLANCA 
WOULD RUN ON TO INVESTIGATE THE HEAD OF THE COW 
WHICH SETON HAD CUT OFF AND PUT TO ONE SIDE 
IT COULD ONLY BE APPROACHED THROUGH A NARROW PASSAGE BETWEEN ROCKS 
AND IT WAS HERE THAT SETON PLANTED SEVERAL OF HIS BEST TRAPS 
PROPERLY DEODORISED AND CONCEALED WITH THE UTMOST CARE 
WEDNESDAY JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH THIS EVENING I AM MORE EXCITED 
AND YET MORE ANXIOUS THAN I HAVE BEEN IN THREE LONG MONTHS 
TRY AS I MIGHT I CANNOT GET TO SLEEP 
THE FOLLOWING MORNING SETON WENT UP THE CANYON 
HOPING THAT AT LAST HE HAD STRUCK A BLOW AGAINST LOBO 
HE WAS IN LUCK BLANCA HAD WALKED RIGHT INTO HIS TRAP 
ACCORDING TO SETON LOBO REMAINED CLOSE BY 
RELUCTANT TO LEAVE HIS MATE 
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUICIDE TO STAY AND FACE THE MEN'S GUNS 
SETON WOULD LATER RECOIL FROM WHAT HE CALLED THE INEVITABLE TRAGEDY THAT FOLLOWED 
BUT THE PLAIN FACT IS HE WAS HERE TO DO A JOB 
HE WAS HERE TO KILL WOLVES 
SUCCESS AT LAST 
SETON HAD CLAIMED HIS FIRST SCALP 
AND YET NOW WITH BLANCA DEAD LOBO WAS ABOUT TO TOUCH SETON'S HEART 
AND CHANGE FOREVER THE WAY HE SAW WOLVES 
THE KING OF THE CURRUMPAW HAD LOST HIS MATE 
TONIGHT I HEARD LOBO UP IN THE CANYON 
AND THERE WAS AN UNMISTAKABLE NOTE OF SORROW IN HIS VOICE 
IT WAS NO LONGER THE LOUD DEFIANT HOWL I HAD HEARD SO OFTEN 
BUT A LONG PLAINTIVE WAIL 
BLANCA BLANCA HE SEEMED TO CALL 
IT WAS SADDER THAN I COULD POSSIBLY HAVE IMAGINED 
I THINK THERE IS AN EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT BETWEEN WOLVES IN A PACK 
CERTAINLY AMONG A MATED PAIR 
AND THE EXAMPLE I USE IS HERE IN YELLOWSTONE A WOLF DIED 
A FEMALE WOLF SHE WAS THE ALPHA 
VERY SIMILAR TO BLANCA 
SHE WAS KILLED BY ANOTHER PACK AND THE ALPHA MALE 
PARDON MY WAY OF PUTTING IT SEEMED TO MOURN 
HE HOWLED FOR TWO DAYS AFTER MORE THAN ANYONE HAD SEEN HIM HOWL 
AND HE WAILED AND HE WAILED AND HE WAILED 
A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT SETON DESCRIBED IN HIS STORY 
WE'VE SEEN HERE IN THE WILDS OF YELLOWSTONE 
SETON HAD BROUGHT BLANCA'S BODY BACK TO HIS CABIN 
BUT THE LAST THING HE EXPECTED 
WAS FOR LOBO TO THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND AND COME LOOKING FOR HER 
NOT ONCE HAS HE SHOWN HIMSELF IN ALL THE MONTHS I'VE PURSUED HIM 
YET NOW HE SCORNS HIS OWN SAFETY TO FIND HIS BELOVED BLANCA 
WE CAN ONLY GUESS WHAT DOUBTS WERE CREEPING INTO SETON'S MIND 
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO STOP NOW 
SETON HAD TO STRIKE FAST WHILE LOBO'S GUARD WAS DOWN 
HE GATHERED IN ALL HIS TRAPS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY IN ALL 
AND SET THEM ON EVERY APPROACH TO HIS CABIN 
LAST OF ALL HE USED BLANCA'S SCENT AS A LURE TO DRAW LOBO IN 
SETON SET OUT THE NEXT MORNING WITH CONFIDENCE 
EVERY OUTLAW TALE HAS ITS SHOWDOWN 
AND FOR SETON AND LOBO THE FATEFUL DAY WAS JANUARY THIRTY FIRST ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FOUR 
HIS PLAN HAD WORKED 
THE FIRST THING SETON DID 
WAS TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH 
IT'S AN ASTONISHING RECORD THAT SURVIVES TO THIS DAY 
OLD LOBO THE KING OF THE CURRUMPAW 
IS CLEARLY VISIBLE CAUGHT IN FOUR TRAPS ONE ON EACH LEG 
THAT'S WHAT IT HAD TAKEN TO STOP THIS INCREDIBLE WOLF 
SETON HAD WON 
AFTER THE LONG CHASE HE FINALLY HAD LOBO AT HIS MERCY 
BUT FACE TO FACE WITH HIS ADVERSARY SETON'S RESOLVE FALTERED 
PERHAPS KILLING LOBO NO LONGER FELT LIKE A VICTORY BUT A CRIME 
PERHAPS IN HIS EYES 
LOBO WAS NO LONGER VERMIN BUT A CREATURE WITH DIGNITY 
COURAGEOUS LOYAL AND LOVING 
UNTILL NOW SETON HAD SEEN WOLVES SIMPLY AS INDISCRIMINATE KILLERS 
BUT THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY MUCH MORE THAN THAT 
THEY WERE THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF AMERICA'S VANISHING WILDERNESS 
IT'S AS IF THE CONFLICT WITHIN SETON 
BETWEEN THE HUNTER AND THE NATURALIST WAS FINALLY RESOLVED 
HE DECIDED TO TAKE LOBO BACK ALIVE 
SADLY IT WAS TOO LATE 
LOBO MADE NO RESISTANCE TO ME 
HE NEVER ONCE LOOKED AT ME 
BUT ACTED AS THOUGH HE WAS ALONE ON THE PLAINS 
HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON THE FAR ROLLING MESAS 
HIS PASSING KINGDOM WHERE HIS FAMOUS BAND WAS NOW SCATTERED 
WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN HE WAS STILL GAZING OUT ACROSS THE PRAIRIE 
BUT WITHIN A FEW HOURS THE OLD KING WOLF WAS DEAD 
WE KNOW THAT AN EAGLE ROBBED OF HIS FREEDOM 
A LION SHORN OF HIS STRENGTH A DOVE BEREFT OF HIS MATE ALL DIE 
IT IS SAID OF A BROKEN HEART 
AND SO IT WAS WITH OLD LOBO THE KING OF THE CURRUMPAW 
IT WAS LOBO'S LOYALTY TO BLANCA THAT HAD BEEN HIS DOWNFALL 
AND NOW SETON TOOK LOBO TO BE WITH HER AGAIN 
SETON PROFOUNDLY REGRETTED WHAT HE HAD DONE 
HE NEVER KILLED ANOTHER WOLF 
WHEN I READ SETON'S STORY TO A CERTAIN DEGREE I FILTERED THROUGH 
A LOT OF HIS FLOWERY LANGUAGE 
I LOOKED AT IT THROUGH A BIOLOGICAL LENS 
IS WHAT THESE WOLVES WERE DOING GIVEN THE CONTEXT OF THE TIME 
WHICH WAS NO TO LITTLE NATURAL PREY A LASER FOCUS ON KILLING LIVESTOCK 
AN INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO AVOID TRAPS AND GUNS AND POISONS 
IS ALL THAT POSSIBLE ABSOLUTELY 
DO WOLVES HAVE AN INCREDIBLY STRONG ATTACHMENT 
BETWEEN A MATED PAIR ABSOLUTELY 
LOBO THE LAST OUTLAW WOLF OF NEW MEXICO WAS DEAD 
THE CURRUMPAW VALLEY HAD BEEN SILENCED 
IT WAS JOB DONE 
BY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FOUR IT SEEMED THAT VIRTUALLY ALL OF AMERICA'S WILDERNESS 
WAS DESTINED TO BE CLEANED UP CIVILISED AND MADE SAFE 
SETON HAD COME HERE IN THE TWILIGHT YEARS OF THE WILD WEST 
JUST AS THE SUN WAS SETTING ON A MAGNIFICENT UNTAMED WORLD 
AND HE HAD PLAYED HIS PART IN ITS DESTRUCTION 
IF WE'RE INCLINED TO JUDGE SETON HARSHLY WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT 
IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES WOLVES WERE CATTLE KILLERS 
AND COULD RUIN THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE PIONEER RANCHERS AND THE COWBOYS 
BUT THAT WAS NOT THE END OF LOBO'S IMPACT ON THE WORLD OF MEN 
IN FACT IT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING 
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT TO SETON AND THE STORY HE WROTE ABOUT LOBO WOULD HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT 
ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AMERICANS AND THEIR WILDERNESS 
SETON RETURNED EAST DEEPLY AFFECTED BY 
HIS WESTERN ADVENTURE 
AND DETERMINED TO RECORD WHAT HAD HAPPENED 
IN THE STORY HE WROTE HE BOLDLY CAST HIMSELF AS THE VILLAIN 
AND THE WOLF AS THE HERO 
HIS BOOK WILD ANIMALS I HAVE KNOWN WAS AN IMMEDIATE WORLDWIDE HIT 
VIRTUALLY OVERNIGHT IT PROPELLED SETON FROM A LITTLE KNOWN NATURALIST 
INTO A MAJOR CELEBRITY 
BUT WHAT REALLY MATTERED TO SETON NOW WAS SAVING AMERICA'S WILDERNESS BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE 
HISTORIAN DAVID WITT THINKS THE TURNING POINT CAN BE TRACED BACK TO A SINGLE WORD IN SETON'S JOURNAL 
HE HAS THIS LAST WORD IN THE ENTRY WHY 
AND IT'S A VERY BIG WHY IT WAS EVEN WRITTEN IN LARGE LETTERS 
I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WAS PUTTING DOWN THAT WHY ASKING WHY DID THE ANIMAL DIE 
BECAUSE HE FOLLOWS UP WITH A COUPLE OF NOTES ABOUT THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE ANIMAL 
BUT I THINK THAT THE WHY WAS MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT 
IT REALLY WAS A WHY ASKING WHY ARE WE DOING THIS 
WHAT IS OUR RELATIONSHIP TO NATURE 
WHY ARE WE DESTROYING IT LIKE THIS 
AT A TIME WHEN FEW PEOPLE QUESTIONED THE DESTRUCTION OF NATURE 
SETON SPOKE UP FOR THE WILDERNESS 
HIS VIEWS ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE WILD FOUND FAVOUR WITH POLITICIANS LIKE TEDDY ROOSEVELT 
AND HELPED TO TURN THE TIDE OF PUBLIC OPINION 
SETON USED HIS INFLUENCE TO PUSH FOR THE CREATION OF MORE NATIONAL PARKS 
THOUSANDS OF ORDINARY AMERICANS 
BECAME AWARE OF THEIR SPECTACULAR NATURAL HERITAGE 
SO SETON TOOK A LEADING ROLE IN WHAT BECAME THE CONSERVATION MOVEMENT 
AND EVENTUALLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT 
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP NOT ONLY TO ANIMALS BUT TO ALL OF NATURE 
HE WAS DOING IT IN A VERY ECOLOGICAL WAY HE WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE FIRST ECOLOGISTS 
SETON ALSO LOBBIED FOR HUNTING RESTRICTIONS AND ANTI POACHING MEASURES 
AND WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN PUSHING THROUGH RADICAL NEW LAWS TO PROTECT MIGRATING BIRDS 
HE DID LOBBY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION INCLUDING THE FIRST 
WILDLIFE LEGISLATION THAT PROTECTED MIGRATORY ANIMALS 
BECAUSE OF SETON THEY LOBBIED CONGRESS AND EXPANDED 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY TO THE INTERSTATE CONTROL OF WILDLIFE 
IT WAS A MAJOR INCREASE IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY AND IT LAID 
THE GROUNDWORK FOR EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION THAT HAS COME AFTER THAT TIME 
AND IT WASN'T JUST A QUESTION OF SAVING THE WILDERNESS 
SETON FELT THAT PEOPLE HAD TO EXPERIENCE IT IN ORDER TO CARE ABOUT IT 
THAT IT SHOULD BE A PART OF EVERYONE'S UPBRINGING 
INSPIRED BY THE VALUES OF NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE HE FOUNDED THE WOODCRAFT INDIANS 
AN ORGANISATION THAT TAUGHT CHILDREN MANY OF THE SKILLS 
NEEDED FOR OUTDOOR LIFE ALONG WITH A RESPECT FOR NATURE 
MANY OF THESE IDEAS WERE LATER ADOPTED AS THE BASIS FOR THE BOY SCOUTS IN ENGLAND AND SETON HIMSELF 
WAS A FOUNDING FATHER OF THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA 
BY THE EARLY YEARS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE UNITED STATES LED THE WORLD IN THE CONSERVATION OF NATURE 
AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WERE HEADING OFF TO CAMP IN THE WOODS AND THE MOUNTAINS 
SETON HAD BEEN A PRIME MOVER IN ALL OF THIS 
AND IT HAD ALL STARTED BACK IN THE CURRUMPAW IN THE AUTUMN OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY THREE 
WHEN HE'D SET OUT TO KILL AN OUTLAW WOLF CALLED LOBO 
BUT WHAT ABOUT WOLVES 
WAS THE NEW NATURE LOVING AMERICA READY TO EMBRACE ITS OLD ENEMY 
FOR DECADES SETON WAS VIRTUALLY ALONE 
IN HIS DESIRE TO PROTECT WOLVES ALONGSIDE THE OTHER WILD ANIMALS 
IT HAS TAKEN A LONG TIME FOR THE REST OF AMERICA TO CATCH UP 
AS HEAD OF THE WOLF RE INTRODUCTION PROGRAM IN YELLOWSTONE 
DOUG SMITH SEES HIS JOB AS TRYING TO COMPLETE WHAT SETON BEGAN 
THE CHANGE OF HEART TO WOLVES HAS ONLY BEEN GOING FOR ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS 
I MEAN LITERALLY IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES MOST PEOPLE STILL THOUGHT WOLVES WERE BAD AND 
I THINK WHAT WE HAD IS AN AWAKENING TO A NEW ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT 
AND THAT KILLING ALL THESE PREDATORS 
WOLVES AND OTHER CARNIVORES 
WITHOUT QUESTION FOR SO LONG 
BUT I NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR 
THERE IS STILL A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO RETAIN THE OLD VIEW OF WOLVES 
I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME UP TO ME AND SAID 
MY GRANDFATHER KILLED OFF THIS ANIMAL TO MAKE LIFE HERE EASIER 
AND YOU'RE BRINGING IT BACK 
SO ATTITUDES HAVE CHANGED BUT THE OLD ATTITUDES STILL EXIST 
AND SO NOW WE'RE AT THIS VERY POLARISED BASHING OF HEADS ABOUT HOW TO 
LIVE IN THIS WORLD 
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE FEEL PREDATORS LIKE WOLVES HAVE NO PLACE STILL 
AS MANY PEOPLE FELT IN SETON'S TIME 
BUT OTHERS ARE SAYING HEY WE MADE A MISTAKE AND WE NEED TO BRING WOLVES BACK 
SETON HAS HAD A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON WHERE WE ARE TODAY 
IN TERMS OF RESPECTING NATURE 
AND I THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE AT LEAST IN NORTH AMERICA 
CANADIANS AND AMERICANS 
RECOGNISE THAT WE HAVE MAYBE OVERSTRETCHED OUR REACH 
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE TAKEN 
LIKE MANY A GOOD TALE FROM THE WILD WEST 
LOBO'S STORY IS A MIXTURE OF MYTH AND TRUTH 
ON THE ONE HAND WE KNOW THAT SETON COULD EXAGGERATE 
THE REWARD ON LOBO'S HEAD WAS NOT A THOUSAND DOLLARS 
BUT A MERE TWELVE 
AND WE KNOW FROM SETON'S DIARY THAT LOBO WAS NOT A MONSTER OF 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY POUNDS BUT AN AVERAGED SIZED WOLF 
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S A LOT OF TRUTH IN THE STORY 
MANY OF THE TRAPS THAT SETON USED ARE STILL THERE IN NEW MEXICO 
THERE'S SETON'S PHOTOGRAPH OF LOBO IN ONE OF THOSE TRAPS AND WE HAVE THIS 
IT'S THE SKULL OF ONE OF THE WOLVES THAT SETON KILLED 
WITH SETON'S OWN LABEL STILL ATTACHED 
AND THE MUSEUM THAT OWNS IT THINKS IT MAY WELL BE THE SKULL OF BLANCA 
WHATEVER THE TRUTH THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS STORY IS THAT IT DEPICTED WOLVES 
IN A MORE REALISTIC AND MORE SYMPATHETIC WAY THAN ANYTHING THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE 
THE DUEL BETWEEN SETON AND LOBO MAY HAVE ENDED IN SAD DEATHS BUT IT ALSO BREATHED NEW LIFE 
INTO THE AMERICANS' APPRECIATION OF THE WILDERNESS 
IN LATER LIFE SETON RETURNED TO LIVE IN HIS BELOVED NEW MEXICO 
I HAVE BEEN MUCH CRITICISED 
FIRSTLY FOR KILLING BLANCA AND LOBO 
BUT CHIEFLY FOR TELLING OF IT TO THE DISTRESS OF MANY TENDER HEARTS 
TO THIS I REPLY IN WHAT FRAME OF MIND ARE MY READERS LEFT WITH REGARD TO THE WOLF 
ARE THEIR SYMPATHIES QUICKENED TOWARD THE MAN WHO KILLED HIM 
OR TOWARD THE NOBLE CREATURE WHO DIED AS HE LIVED 
DIGNIFIED FEARLESS AND STEADFAST 
RIGHT UP TO HIS DEATH IN NINETEEN FORTY SIX 
SETON CONTINUED TO REFLECT ON THE WOLF THAT CHANGED HIS LIFE 
EVER SINCE LOBO MY SINCEREST WISH HAS BEEN TO IMPRESS UPON PEOPLE 
THAT EACH OF OUR NATIVE WILD CREATURES 
IS IN ITSELF A PRECIOUS HERITAGE THAT WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO DESTROY 
OR PUT BEYOND THE REACH OF OUR CHILDREN 
NEXT WEEK NATURAL WORLD JOINS A SAMI FAMILY AND THEIR REINDEER 
ON A GRUELLING MIGRATION ACROSS ARCTIC NORWAY
