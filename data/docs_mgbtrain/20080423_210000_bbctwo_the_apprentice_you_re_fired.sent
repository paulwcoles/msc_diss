STILL REELING FROM THE HORROR OF IT 
ALL WONDERS WHERE IT WENT WRONG

UNSEEN FOOTAGE WE LOOK AT HOW THE 
ICE CREAM TASK SAW LINDI FROZEN OUT 
CANDIDATES TOND DON'T TEND TO 
HIDE THEIR LIGHTS UNDER BUSHELS 
BUT THIS WEEK THEY FELL IN LOVE 
WITH THEMSELVES

HOT 
I'M JUST OVERWHELMED BY HOW HOT GOOD WE ARE 
WE'RE ABSOLUTELY 
AMAZING 
THIS R. IF THEY WERE ICE AMAZING CREAM THEY'D LICK THEMSELVES A MAN 
WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT CREATE AGO A 
NEW LINE OF DESERTS JAMES 
AVERDIECK CAROL THATCHER IS HERE 
AND THE BOSS OF WAITROSE MARK 
PRICE WELCOME TO YOU ALL 
TONIGHT'S TASK OF CREATING AND 
SELLING NEW FLAVOURS OF ICE CREAM 
STARTED SWEETLY ENOUGH TORE FOR 
LINDI BUT IT ALL MELTED AWAY YOU YOU WERE SECOND IN COMMAND SECOND IN 
COMMAND FOR WHAT I THINK WAS THE 
MOST IMPORTANT PART IN THIS TASK 
IDENTIFYING THE CUSTOMERS AND THE 
SELLING OF THE MERCHANDISE IT'S 
SALES THAT YOU LOST THIS TASK ON 
THAT BRINGS ME TO A CONCLUSION 
THAT LINDI YOU'RE FIRED 
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN PLEASE 
WELCOME LINDI MNGAZA 
EVERY YEAR THERE'S A BRUMMIE ON I 
THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GO ALL THE 
WAY AND YOU'VE 
LET US DOWN I'VE I'VE LET THE MIDLANDS DOWN 
WHAT WENT 
WRONG 
I WASN'T VOCAL ENOUGH IN THE WRONG BOARDROOM I THINK I SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN MORE VOCAL THROUGHOUT THE TASK 
AND SORT OF MADE THINGS THERE WERE 
LOTS OF THINGS I WAS UNHAPPY ABOUT 
AND I LET PEOPLE RUN AWAY WITH 
THEMSELVES I SHOULD HAVE REINED IN 
THE EXCLUSIVITY THING 
HOW DO YOU 
FEEL YOU CAME ACROSS IN THE 
EPISODE 
I WATCHED AND I THOUGHT I EPISODE WAS SORT OF AT POINTS I WAS 
CRINGING BUT OTHER POINTS I 
THOUGHT WELL YOU KNOW YOU LEARN 
FROM THINGS IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING 
EXPERIENCE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT EXPERIENCE WHERE IT ALL WENT WRONG FOR YOU 
I'M A DEVIL ON THE RUN 
WE'RE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
IS THERE 
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO AGREE IT 
WON'T GO INTO ANY OTHER PUBS FOR 
THREE MONTHS WE'LL 
YOU 
EXCLUSIVITY FOR THREE MONTHS THAT 
WAS EASY AN AMAZING IDEA 
YOU HAD 
NO RIGHT OFFERING ANY EXCLUSIVITY 
WHATSOEVER WHATSOEVER I'M GOING DOWN IN A BLAZE OF 
GLORY 
HAD I KNOWN THIS EARLIER ON THESE 
SALES WOULD HAVE BEEN VOID LET'S 
GET ONTO SELLING 
LUCINDA PUT ME 
SECOND IN COMMAND OF RAEF AND 
JENNIFER WE MANAGED TO BOOK SIX 
APPOINTMENTS 
THE FACT IS WE MAKE APPOINTMENTS OUR OWN ICE CREAM 
THREE OF THEM 
MADE THEIR OWN ICE CREAM DIDN'T DIDN'T YOU THINK OF ENQUIRING ABOUT THAT 
FIR OF ALL BEFORE YOU WASTED YOUR 
TIME GOING THERE 
SHE COULD SELL A 
ONE LEGGED HORSE 
I DON'T THINK SHE 
CAN 
COULD SHE NOT DON'T THINK CAN I DON'T THINK THEY COULD SELL TO SOMEONE WHO 
MAKES THEIR OWN 
THEY HAD THEIR OWN 
ICE CREAM MAKER 
WE COULD STILL 
SELL TO THEM 
DID YOU SELL TO ANY 
OF THOSE WHO MAKE THEIR OWN ICE 
CREAM 
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN YOU CREAM FEEL THE WORLD CLOSE ANYTHING ON 
YOU IN THE BOARDROOM 
YEAH BEFORE 
YOU GO IN THE BOARDROOM YOU'RE BEST 
OF FRIENDS YOU'RE GOING TO SUPPORT 
EACH OTHER ONCE YOU'RE IN FRONT OF 
SIR ALAN NICK'S THERE MARGARET'S 
THERE IT FALLS TO PIECES NO MORE 
BEST FRIENDS YOU'RE ALL ON YOUR 
OWN IT'S JUST YOU'VE EITHER GOT 
THAT FIGHTING SPIRIT AND YOU WANT 
IT MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE THERE OR 
YOU PUT YOUR HANDS UP AND SAY I WAS 
WRONG 
CAN YOU PUT YOUR HANDS UP WRONG NOW AND SAY YOU WERE WRONG ON THE 
EXCLUSIVITY BUSINESS DEFINITELY DEFINITELY I DIDN'T MEAN PHYSICALLY PUT YOUR 
HANDS UP 
NO I DEFINITELY THINK 
THE EXCLUSIVITY THING JENNIFER IT 
WAS HER SHE BLURT TODAY OUT IN A 
MIDDLE OF A PITCH L. DIDN'T FEEL 
COMFORTABLE IN FRONT OF A CUSTOMER 
TO UNDERMINE HER AUTHORITY IN THAT 
SITUATION I'VE NOW LEARNED FROM IT 
IF I WENT THROUGH THAT SITUATION 
AGAIN I WOULD STEP UP AND SAY 
SOMETHING 
HAVING BLAMED YOURSELF SOMETHING YOU THEN BLAME JENNIFER 
YEAH WELL 
YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE DO SALES 
WHEN YOU WERE FIRST LAUNCHING YOUR 
PUDDINGS JAMES WERE YOU EVER 
OFFERED AN EXCLUSIVE DEAL OR DUE 
OFFER AN EXCLUSIVE DEAL 
I WAS 
ASKED FOR EXCLUSIVITY BUT IF 
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT PRODUCT WHAT'S 
THE POINT IN LIMITING YOUR OPTIONS 
SO I DIDN'T OFFER EXCLUSIVITY 
LINDI I'VE WATCHED ALL THE 
EPISODES SO FAR AND THIS WAS YOUR 
BEST YET WUR VERY VERY UNLUCKY 
THANK YOU I AGREE 
YOU SAY ABOUT EXCLUSIVITY WITH 
SOMEBODY BIG ENOUGH SAY WAITROSE 
LOOKS YOU IN THE EYE AND SAYS JAMES 
I LIKE YOUR PUDDINGS I WANT AN 
EXCLUSIVE DEAL EVERYONE'S GOT 
THEIR PRICE 
YEAH IN THIS SHOW 
THEY DIDN'T USE THE EXCLUSIVITY AS 
A TOOL TO GET MORE SALES THEY 
COULD HAVE SAID WE'LL GIVE YOU 
EXCLUSIVITY IF YOU GIVE US TWO THOUSAND 
WORTH OF BUSINESS 
IT WASN'T A HIGH 
ENOUGH PRICE 
THERE WAS NOTHING 
TRADED FOR THE EXCLUSIVITY WOULD WOULD YOU HAVE SOUGHT AN EXCLUSIVE DEAL 
IF YOU THOUGHT THE PRODUCT WAS GOOD 
ENOUGH 
CAN I JUST SAY YOU DID A ENOUGH FANTASTIC JOB FOR THAT FARMER 
GETTING HIS PRODUCT IN THE MARKET 
THE KEY POINT IS THAT THOSE TRADERS 
HAVE TO SWAP A PRODUCT TO TAKE YOUR 
PRODUCT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO WANT 
IS SOME FORM OF EXCLUSIVITY MANY 
PEOPLE WOULD DO EXACTLY AS THOSE 
PEOPLE DID THEY WOULD SAY WE'RE 
TAKING A RISK ON THIS PRODUCT 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DROP 
SOMETHING ELSE WE DO WANT 
EXCLUSIVITY KAERL 
COULD I START EXCLUSIVITY KAERL BY CONGRATULATING LINDI AND HER 
FELLOW APPRENTICE CONTESTANTS THEY 
MADE THE ICE CREAM FOR STARTERS IF 
I'D BE IN CHARGE THERE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN VERY DRIPY SLUDGE WITH THE ODD 
BIT OF AVOCADO PIECE FLOAT ANYTHING 
IT THEY MADE THE STUFF WELL DONE 
HAVING REALISED HOW EASY IT WAS TO 
MAKE IT YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD 
DIFFERENT SALES STRATEGY YOU'RE 
ALL YOUNG I WOULD HAVE PICKED THE 
BRAINS OF THE FARMER TO SAY YOU'VE 
BEEN MAKING AND SELLING THIS STUFF 
ANY LEADS THAT WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON 
YOUR BEHALF BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW 
HE MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME THE OTHER 
THING I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE 
DISCOVERED AND LINDI ACTUALLY I 
THINK IS A VERY GOOD SALESPERSON I 
JUST WANTED TO DISCOVER THIS 
GENERATION'S DEL BOY AND RODNEY 
SOMEONE WHO WAS PREPARED TO BE 
OUTRAGEOUS AND GO FOR IT WHEREAS 
YOU DID A COMPETENT JOB I WANTED 
SOME WOW FACTOR 
IS THERE A DEL BOY 
AND RODNEY IN THE TEAM WOULD YOU 
PUT YOURSELF IN THAT CATEGORY I I THINK ME AND JEN WE WORKED WELL 
SHE'S THE BEST SALES WOMAN IN 
EUROPE LET'S NOT FORGET BEHIND BEHIND THE BEST IN THE WORLD SHE'S 
GETTING THERE WE WORKED WELL 
TOGETHER I THINK LEE IS AN AMAZING 
SALESPERSON OUT OF THE TEAM THE 
CANDIDATES THERE ARE A GOOD FEW 
PEOPLE IN THERE COMPETENT SALES 
PEOPLE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO 
GENERALLY ARE PITCH ANYTHING 
BOARDROOM ENVIRONMENTS IN BUSINESS 
ENVIRONMENTS WHEN YOU'RE GOING 
DOOR TO DOOR DOING SHOP SALES YOU 
NEED THAT DEL BOY AND RODNEY 
APPROACH 
IN TERMS OF MAKING THE APPROACH ICE CREAM IT SEEMED YOU DID 
REMARKABLY WELL OR IS IT JUST ECEY 
TO MAKE ICE CREAM 
NO IT'S VERY 
DIFFICULT AND THE FLAVOURS SOUNDED 
FANTASTIC I'M SURE WAITROSE 
CUSTOMERS WOULD LOVE TO TRY THEM 
AVOCADO 
SHE COULD DO YOU A DEAL ON AVOCADO IT AN EXCLUSIVE ONE PROBABLY AS 
WELL 
BEFORE THIS TASK I THOUGHT WELL MAKING THE ICE CREAM WAS GOING TO 
BE REALLY HARD BUT ACTUALLY THE 
DIFFICULT PART OF THIS TASK WAS 
SELLING YEAH L. THINK YOU GUYS SELLING YEAH SHOULD HAVE SPENT A LOT MORE 
THINKING ABOUT WHERE YOU WERE GOING 
TO SELL START GETTING ON THE PHONE 
IN FACT YOU GUYS DID BETTER THAN 
THE OTHER TEAM YOU MADE SIX 
APPOINTMENTS ON DAY ONE I'D HAVE 
MADE TWENTY APPOINTMENTS ON DAY ONE 
HOW ABOUT THE ISSUE OF BOOKING 
APPOINTMENTS WITH PLACES THAT 
ALREADY MADE THEIR OWN ICE CREAM 
DO YOU PUT YOUR HANDS UP ON THAT 
ONE 
I WILL LUCKILY MY SIDE OF ONE THE TEAM DIDN'T GO TO ANY OF THOSE 
APPOINTMENTS BUT HAD WE HAVE BEEN 
TO AN ICE CREAM PARLOUR I I'M 
CONFIDENT I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
SELL THEM MAYBE GIVING THE WEAKER 
SALES TEAM THOSE APPOINTMENTS WAS 
NOT THE BEST THING TO DO YOU'RE YOU'RE BIGGING YOURSELF UP THERE A LITTLE 
BIT BUT THE WHOLE TEAM WASN'T SLOW 
IN BIGGING ITSELF UP BLIEMY YOU 
LOVED YOURSELVES 
THE FOCUS NOW IS BLOWING THE OTHER 
TEAM OUT OF THE WATER IT'S GOING 
TO BE WALK IN THE PARK 
I DID AN 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC JOB 
WE WILL 
TALK WINNING SURPRISES AND TREATS 
WE ARE SIZZLING HOT SUPERSTARS 
I'M OVERWHELMED BY HOW GOOD WE ARE 
WE'RE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
DO WE 
REALLY NEED TO WORK FOR S. A. S. WHI 
WE ARRIVED BACK AT THE HOUSE ALPHA 
WERE DISCUSSING WHAT OUTFITS THEY 
WERE GOING TO WEAR FOR THEIR 
WINNING DAY TOMORROW 
WE ARE NOT 
ONLY GOING TO KICK YOUR ARSE WE'RE 
GOING TO MAKE HISTORY THE FUCKING 
SHIT WE'VE PULLED OUT OF THE BAG 
TODAY 
THEY SHOULD RESPECT NOT TO TODAY BE SO VULGAR AND ARROGANT 
TO ME 
WE'VE WON THAT TASK 
DO YOU 
ENCOURAGE SELF LOVE AMONGST YOUR 
STAFF 
PERHAPS NOT TO THAT DEGREE STAFF IT'S HEALTHY TO BE A LITTLE SELF 
CRITICAL AND TO CHALLENGE YOURSELF 
IT'S GREAT THAT PEOPLE FEEL 
CONFIDENT YOU WERE ENJOYING 
YOURSELF AND FEELING CONFIDENT 
IT'S UNBRITISH ISN'T IT THIS KIND 
OF COCKINESS 
I COME FROM A 
POLITICAL BACKGROUND AND I DON'T 
THINK I'M SEEN SO MUCH BLOWING OWN 
TRUMPET PATTING YOURSELF ON BACK 
AS LINDI AND HER PALS ON THE 
PROGRAMME 
IT'S LIKE A TORY PARTY PROGRAMME CONFERENCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR OR SOMETHING IT IT CAME CLOSE L. WONDER WHY THEY 
COULDN'T HAVE CHANNELED A BIT OF 
THAT INTO ACTUALLY DELIVERING YOU YOU HAVE A LOT OF SELF CONFIDENCE WHEN 
IT COMES TO SALES AND BELIEVE THAT 
YOU CAN DO IT L. THINK WE DID 
CHANNEL A LOT INTO BOOKING 
APPOINTMENTS AND WE DID GO TO WE 
KNOCKED ON SO MANY DOORS UP AND 
DOWN HIGH STREETS AND WENT INTO SO 
MANY PLACES THAT YOU DON'T GET TO 
SEE ALL ON THE SHOW THERE WAS A 
LOT MORE FOCUS A LOT MORE DOOR 
KNOCKING AND CALLING THAN YOU 
PROBABLY SAW IN AN HOUR LONG 
PROGRAMME 
YOU WERE BRILLIANTLY LED PROGRAMME AGAINST ALL EXPECTATIONS BY LUCINDA 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR PROJECT 
MANAGER WHO IT'S FAIR TO SAY 
EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS SHE'S HAD A 
TOUGH TIME WITH 
ONE OF 
HER COLLEAGUES OVER THE LAST FEW 
WEEKS 
SHE'S BEEN INCOMPETENT LAZY WEEKS AND SHE DOESN'T WANT TO PULL HER 
WEIGHT 
DO NOT SPEAK TO ME LIKE WEIGHT THAT HOW DARE YOU 
SHE IS 
ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW VICIOUS AND 
EVIL 
I THINK YOU ARE A HIGHLY EVIL MANIPULATIVE YOUNG LADY 
ALPHA YOUR 
TEAM LEADER IS GOING TO BE LUCINDA 
WHAT I PROPOSE WE DO IS A BIT OF 
HOUSE KEEPING IF ANYONE IS 
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WHAT THEY'RE 
DOING LET'S SPEAK UP 
SHE'S PRETTY 
DAMN GOOD ABOUT ORGANISING AND 
LEADING A TEAM 
THAT'S WHAT I'M 
TALKING ABOUT LUCINDA HAS BEEN 
BRILLIANT 
HUGE FUCK UP BUT LET'S BRILLIANT TAKE IT FORWARD 
GOOD TEAM LEADER 
VERY GOOD SIR ALAN LUCINDA LUCINDA EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS I THOUGHT 
IT WAS GOING TO BE A NIGHTMARE SHE 
FINALLY GOT HER FINGER OUT OF HER 
ARSE 
SHE FINALLY GOT HER FINGER ARSE OUT OF HER ARSE THAT'S THE CLOSEST 
YOU GOAT A COMPLIMENT FROM HELENE 
DID SHE SURPRISE YOU SHE SHE ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED ME L. WAS NEARLY 
SPEECHLESS WHEN I SAW HER 
MANAGEMENT STYLE THE PAST FOUR 
TASKS I SAW EVERYBODY CARRYING 
LUCINDA SHE DIDN'T DO MUCH ALL OF 
US IN THE TEAM WERE PLEASANTLY 
SURPRISED WHEN WE SAW HER PERFORM 
AS A MANAGER HER STYLE IS RELAXED 
AND LAID BACK SHE'S BETTER MAYBE 
AS A MANAGER THAN HAY MEMBER OF A 
TEAM BECAUSE SHE'S ALSO RELAXED AND 
LAID BACK WHEN SOMETIMES YOU KNEED 
A BIT OF WORKLING WORKING 
LOUVRE SIN D. A. IS MANAGER SHE'S 
NOT MUCH GOOD AT ANYTHING ELSE YOU YOU NEED LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF 
PEOPLE IN AN ORGANISATION L. L. KIND 
LIKE LUCINDA SHE'S CLEARLY CLEVER 
SHE'S E. M. P. THETIC WHAT SHE'S 
UNDERSTOOD IS HOW YOU NEED TO BUILD 
A TEAM AND MAKE IT UP IT WAS HER 
SUGGESTION THAT FOUR THE SECOND 
PHASE OF THE TASK YOU CHANGE THE 
MIX SO THERE WAS MARKETING AND 
PRODUCTION L. THOUGHT THAT WAS A 
VERY CLEVER IDEA SHE COULD SEE THE 
SKILLS AND ACTS 
SHE WANTED THAT 
BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU 
WOULDN'T WEAR IT WOULD YOU 
NO WE 
WOULDN'T BUDGE ME RAEF AND JEN GOT 
ON EXTREMELY WELL LOOKING BACK IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER THING FOR 
THE TEAM IF WE DID SPLIT UP IN THE 
BACK OF YOUR MIND YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT 
WE'RE ALL COMPETING FOR ONE JOB IF 
WE SPLIT UP WE COULD BE POTENTIALLY 
ON THE LOSING THREE OUT OF THE TWO 
SIDES OF THE TEAM IF YOU LOSE THE 
TASK YOU'RE IN THE BOARDROOM 
YOU'RE NOT MAKING DECISION THAT'S 
YOU'D MAKE IN A NORMAL SITUATION 
YOU'RE MAKING A DECISION THINKING 
MY NECK'S ON THE LINE AND WHAT'S 
BEST FOR ME 
LUCINDA SHE IS A GOOD 
MANAGER AND A BRILLIANT RISK 
MANAGER SHE GOT AN EXCELLENT 
WE'RE ALL AGREED AN EXCELLENT 
GRASP OF PROBABILITY HERE 
WHAT IS 
THE RISK HERE OF YOU GETTING FIRED 
THE PROBABILITY IS ONE IN THREE 
THAT WAS GREAT BRILLIANT THAT IS 
INSPIRED LOOK AT THE BODY LANGUAGE 
HERE L. L. DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE'S A 
CHURCH GOER BUT SHE DIDN'T STOP 
PRAYING AT THE END OF THE BOARDROOM 
THE POWER OF PRAYER IT WORKS 
CLAP CLP 
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT SIR ALAN AND 
YOUR FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES HAD TO 
SAY 
YOU KNOW THE FIRST ERROR SHE SAY MADE WAS SETTING UP APPOINTMENTS 
WASTING PEOPLE'S TIME PHONING UP 
COMPANIES THAT MAKE THEIR OWN ICE 
CREAM L. MEAN WHERE'S HER BRAIN 
THE FACT IS WE MAKE OUR OWN ICE 
CREAM I'M HAPPY MAKING IT MYSELF 
THERE'S CONFIDENCE WITH LINDI AND 
IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING SHE NEEDS 
TO LEARN SHE THINKS SHE CAN SELL 
ANYTHING TO ANYBODY DON'T THINK 
YOU CAN SELL ICE CREAM TO AN ICE 
CREAM MAKER 
CAN AWE GREE IT WON'T 
GO INTO OTHER PUBS FOR THREE MONTHS 
SHE MADE SOME DIABOLICAL MISTAKES 
IN PARTICULAR OFFERING EXCLUSIVITY 
WE CAN PUT THAT AS A CONDITION ON 
THE ORDER THAT WE'LL GUARANTEE YOU 
EXCLUSIVITY FOR THREE MONTHS 
DEFINITELY O. K. 
LINDI EXCELLENT AT DEFINITELY O. K. SALES BUT I DON'T THINK HAS GOT THE 
IDEAS THE INNOVATION OR HEAD FOR 
BUSINESS 
ARE YOU WORRIED 
NO I BUSINESS JUST FIND IT ANNOYING WHEN PEOPLE 
TELL YOU HOW DO DO THINGS THAT YOU 
KNOW HOW TO DO 
SHE'S FULL OF HER 
SELF IMPORTANCE THAT'S WHY I SAID 
TO HER LINDI YOU'RE FIRED 
THINK ABOUT THAT YOU LOOKED HURT 
YEAH IT'S VERY HUMBLING BUT YEAH 
NO I CAN'T DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING 
ANYBODY SAYS YOU LIVE AND LEARN L. 
MUST SAY I'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM 
THE EXPERIENCE L. DO THINK I'M AN 
IMPORTANT PERSON AS IS EVERYBODY 
ELSE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT L. THINK 
THAT YOU KNOW YEAH THE 
EXCLUSIVITY THING WAS A HUGE ERROR 
AND IT WAS SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE 
REINED IN L. CAN UNDERSTAND THOSE COMMENTS 
IT WAS JENNIFER EUROPE'S COMMENTS GREATEST SALESWOMAN WHO NEARLY HT 
CHOP SHE'S THE ONE THAT JUST ABOUT 
ESCAPED THIS WEEK 
NOT ONCE DID I 
EVER SAY I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD 
SPLIT THE TEAMS IF YOU'RE GOING TO 
ACCUSE ME MAKE SURE YOUR FACTS ARE 
RIGHT 
IT WAS THE LOOKS YOU GAVE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THIS TEAM ARE NOT 
COMFORTABLE WITH HOW YOU ARE WHO WHO THEY CAN STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES 
NOT ONCE DID ANYBODY SAY THERE WAS 
AN ISSUE WITH THE TEAM AS SOON AS 
YOU'RE IN THE BOARDROOM THERE'S 
FUCKING ISSUE THAT'S BULL SHIT I I THINK I'M BEING USED AS A SCAPEGOAT 
HERE IF YOU DECIDE YOU WANTED TO 
MAKE AN ORDER TODAY YOU WILL HAVE 
EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS IN YOUR CINEMAS 
JENNIFER THE EXCLUSIVITY THING IS 
UNFORGIVABLE 
I'M NOT A BAD APPLE UNFORGIVABLE I'M TRYING TO LOCK AT THE BIGGER 
PICTURE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE 
BEST CANDIDATE L. DON'T THINK YOU 
WANT SOMEBODY IN YOUR ORGANISATION 
WHO LIES 
O. K. THAT'S IT LINDI 
YOU'RE FIRED 
JENNIFER YOU SAY IN YOUR 
APPLICATION ONE OF YOUR WORST 
QUALITIES IS GIVING IDIOTS A SECOND 
CHANCE MAYBE SOMETHING'S RUBBED 
OFF IN THIS ROOM BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT 
A SECOND CHANCE 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH 
WHAT DID DO YOU MAKE OF HER MUCH MARK SHE SENDS A CHILL DOWN MY 
SPINE 
IN THE EARLIER SERIES ONE SPINE THOUGHT SHE WAS VERY GOOD AND I 
THOUGHT SHE WAS A CONTENDER SHE 
LET HERSELF DOWN A BIT ON THIS TASK 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HER WOULD YOU 
HAVE HER OUT THERE SELLING YOUR 
PUDDINGS 
THERE'S SOMETHING OF THE PUDDINGS NIGHT ABOUT HER SHE LOOKS LIKE 
SHE LOOKED LIKE A CLEUDO CHARACTER MISS SCARPLT VERY RED 
LIPSTICK 
SHE FRIGHTENED ME TO LIPSTICK DEATH I'LL HAVE TO FACE HER ONE 
DAY I 
PUT IT AS DAY COLOURFULLY AS JAMES JUST HAS L. 
THOUGHT SHE'S DUPLICITOUS L. 
SUSPECT SHE'LL GET FOUND OUT IS IS SHE COLD THAT WAS THE GENERAL VIEW 
OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES WHEN THEY 
GOT BACK TO THE HOUSE ANOTHER ANOTHER POINT THAT CAME ACROSS WAS THAT I 
WAS QUITE COLD APPARENTLY H. M. M. 
AREN'T THOSE MOMENTS ABSOLUTELY TOE 
CURLING 
THEY ARE WHEN YOU'RE IN CURLING THAT SITUATION AND NOBODY SAYS 
ANYTHING AND YOU'RE ALL LOOKING AT 
EACH OTHER IT'S LIKE YOU COULD CUT 
THE ATMOSPHERE WITH A KNIFE YOU'RE 
WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO SPEAK AND 
NO ONE DOES IT SEEMS LIKE IT GOES 
ON FOREVER 
CLAIRE DID RATHER WELL 
SHE ACTUALLY WE HAVE SAW A 
TRANSFORMATION SHE'D UNDERTAKEN 
THIS WEEK LET'S REMIND OURSELVES 
OF HOW SHE USED TO BE BEFORE HER 
BOLLICING LAST WEEK

OVERPOWER PEOPLE WHO AREN'T AS 
VOCAL AS YOU

NEED TO MANAGE 
PROJECT MANAGING

PRESSURE I'VE BEEN UNDER IN A WORK

NUMBER OF CHANGES IN CLAIRE AND HER 
APPROACH TO THE TEAM

HERE WAS A KICK UP THE BACKSIDE 
VERY CLEVER MOVE AT THE END 
BUTTERING UP SIR ALAN SAYING I OWE 
THIS ALL TO YOU THIS 
TRANSFORMATION WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 
CLAIRE 
I THINK CLAIRE IS A WOMAN CLAIRE WHO KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS 
SHE'S A VERY BIG CHARACTER IN EVERY 
SENSE OF THE WORD L. DIDN'T MEAN IT 
LIKE THAT I'M VERY RARELY MEET 
PEOPLE WHO MAKE ME FEEL QUIET AND 
SHE'S ONE OF THE FEW THAT I MEET 
WHO MADE ME FEEL THAT WAY SHE 
KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS AND 
SHE WILL DO EVERYTHING WITHIN HER 
POWER TO GET IT AND MORE RESPECT TO 
HER FOR DOING THAT 
CAROL YOU MAKE 
ME FEEL QUIET 
I THINK BOSSY 
BULLYING LOUD MOUTH AND THEN OF 
COURSE SHE HAD THE BOLL OKING BUT 
DOES A LEOPARD CHANGE ITS SPOTS 
LET'S SEE IN THE UPCOMING EPISODES 
THERE'S AN APPROVING GROAN FROM THE 
AUDIENCE I THINK THEY STILL WANT 
TO SEE HER HEAD ON THE BLOCK 
LIKE HER FOR THIS THOUGH AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THIS EPISODE WHEN SIR 
ALAN ARRIVED IN THE HOUSE SHE 
REACTS EXACTLY AS ANY OF US WOULD 
REACT IF SIR ALAN CAME KNOCKING AT
