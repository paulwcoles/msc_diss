AMPHIBIANS WERE THE FIRST BACKBONED ANIMALS TO LEAVE THE WATER AND COLONISE THE LAND 
TODAY THERE ARE SOME SIX THOUSAND SPECIES OF THEM 
AND NEW ONES ARE CONSTANTLY BEING DISCOVERED 
WE MAY NOT OFTEN SEE THEM 
BUT DURING THE BREEDING SEASON WE CERTAINLY HEAR THEM 
CHORUSES LIKE THIS ENSURE THAT WE ARE WELL AWARE OF FROGS AND TOADS 
BUT THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF AMPHIBIANS 
THAT DON'T MAKE THEMSELVES SO OBVIOUS 
NEWTS AND THEIR CLOSE RELATIVES THE SALAMANDERS 
AND EVEN ONES THAT HAVE COMPLETELY LOST THEIR LEGS 
BUT ALL AMPHIBIANS HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON A MOIST SKIN 
IF THAT DRIES THEY DIE 
AND DEALING WITH THAT DANGER DOMINATES THEIR LIVES 
HOW ARE THEY TO SURVIVE AWAY FROM WATER 
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO 
THE ONLY BACKBONED ANIMALS ON THE EARTH WERE FISH 
THE LAND WAS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR INSECTS AND OTHER INVERTEBRATES 
BUT THEN ONE OF THOSE FISH MANAGED TO HAUL ITSELF OUT OF THE WATER 
AND UP ON TO THE LAND 
YOU CAN SEE WHAT SORT OF CREATURE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
IF YOU GO TO NORTH EAST AUSTRALIA 
THERE THE RIVERS ONLY TOO OFTEN DRY UP 
BUT ONE REMARKABLE ANCIENT AND EXTRAORDINARY FISH MANAGED TO SURVIVE 
BECAUSE IT HAS A RARE TALENT FOR A FISH 
IT HAS LUNGS AND CAN BREATHE AIR 
AND THERE'S ONE AT MY FEET RIGHT HERE 
FOSSILS JUST LIKE IT DATE FROM PRECISELY THE TIME WHEN THE GREAT INVASION OF THE LAND TOOK PLACE 
ON OCCASION IT RISES TO THE SURFACE AND GULPS AIR 
THE AIR GOES INTO A POUCH THAT OPENS FROM ITS THROAT 
WHERE THE OXYGEN FROM IT IS ABSORBED 
THIS IS A LUNGFISH 
IT PUNTS ITSELF ALONG THE RIVER BOTTOM 
USING TWO PAIRS OF FLESHY MUSCULAR FINS PLACED LOW ON ITS BODY 
JUST LIKE SIMPLE LEGS 
SOMETIME AROUND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION YEARS AGO ONE OF ITS REMOTE ANCESTORS 
USED SUCH LIMB LIKE FINS TO PUSH ITSELF UP ONTO THE LAND 
THAT PIONEER MAY HAVE LOOKED MUCH LIKE THIS STRANGE MONSTER 
THAT HAUNTS THE WATERWAYS OF JAPAN 
IT'S THE GIANT SALAMANDER THE BIGGEST OF ALL LIVING AMPHIBIANS 
THAT GROWS TO A METRE OR MORE IN LENGTH 
IT TOO HAS LUNGS AND BREATHES AIR 
BUT EVEN SO IT ALMOST NEVER LEAVES THE WATER 
MALES MAKE THEIR DENS IN BOTH NATURAL AND MAN MADE RETREATS IN THE RIVERBANKS 
AND DEFEND THEM AGAINST ALL OTHER MALES 
A NEWCOMER ARRIVES LOOKING FOR A BREEDING DEN OF HIS OWN 
IT WON'T BE HERE 
THE RESIDENT MALE HAS GOOD REASON TO BE SO DEFENSIVE 
HE'S GUARDING A BATCH OF EGGS 
LEFT BY A FEMALE WHO VISITED HIM A FEW DAYS EARLIER 
LIKE FISH EGGS AMPHIBIAN EGGS HAVE NO PROTECTIVE SHELL 
THEY CAN ONLY DEVELOP IN MOISTURE OF SOME KIND 
AND AMPHIBIANS NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE MUST FIND WAYS TO PROVIDE IT 
THE ALPINE NEWT LIVES ON LAND FOR ABOUT HALF THE YEAR 
HUNTING FOR SLUGS AND WORMS 
IN WINTER THEY LIE DORMANT BENEATH THE SNOW 
BUT COME THE SPRING THEY GET THE URGE TO BREED 
A FEMALE IS SWOLLEN WITH EGGS AND NEEDS TO LAY 
SO SHE HAS TO GO BACK TO WATER 
AND THERE A MALE IS AWAITING HER 
HE HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED HIS BREEDING COLOURS 
AND KNOWS HOW TO FLAUNT THEM TO IMPRESS HER 
HE WAFTS A PHEROMONE A SEXUAL STIMULANT 
TOWARDS HER WITH BEATS OF HIS TAIL 
SHE SENSES IT THROUGH HER NOSTRILS 
SHE TASTES IT IN HER MOUTH 
HAVING CAUGHT HER INTEREST HE TURNS AND MOVES AWAY FROM HER 
HIS GENITAL OPENING IS GREATLY SWOLLEN 
AND FROM IT COMES A SMALL WHITE CAPSULE 
IT'S A PACKET OF SPERM 
THE FEMALE LED BY THE MALE WALKS DIRECTLY OVER IT 
HE STOPS AND SO DOES SHE 
WITH HER GENITAL OPENING EXACTLY ABOVE THE SPERM PACKET 
AND SHE PICKS IT UP 
SO AS IN MANY FISH MATING OCCURS WITH LITTLE OR NO PHYSICAL CONTACT BETWEEN THE TWO PARTNERS 
TWO OR THREE DAYS LATER SHE BEGINS TO LAY 
EACH OF HER EGGS IS DEPOSITED INDIVIDUALLY 
AS AN EGG EMERGES SHE WRAPS THE LEAF AROUND IT WITH HER HIND LEGS 
AND THEN HOLDS IT THERE WHILE THE EDGES BOND 
SHE WILL LAY SEVERAL EGGS A DAY FOR WEEK AFTER WEEK 
UNTIL EVENTUALLY SHE MAY HAVE PRODUCED SEVERAL HUNDRED 
BUT ALL THIS HAS TO BE DONE IN WATER 
SHE HAS STILL NOT BROKEN HER LINK WITH HER FISHY ANCESTRY 
IN NORTH AMERICA IN THE EASTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY 
THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF SMALL SALAMANDERS ONLY A FEW INCHES LONG 
THAT HAVE TAKEN ONE FURTHER STEP AWAY FROM THE AQUATIC LIFE 
IN SPRING THE WOODLANDS ARE DRENCHED IN RAIN 
AND SUDDENLY IN RESPONSE AN AMPHIBIAN ARMY APPEARS AMONG THE LEAF LITTER 
MARBLED SALAMANDERS 
FIRST TO EMERGE ARE THE MALES 
THEY'RE IN SEARCH OF FEMALES 
THEY HAVE SPENT THE WINTER DEEP IN THE DAMP LEAF LITTER 
BREATHING BY ABSORBING OXYGEN FROM THE AIR THROUGH THEIR MOIST SKINS 
FOR THEM THE LAND IS TRULY HOME 
IF THEY WERE SUBMERGED IN WATER FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME 
THEY MIGHT WELL DROWN 
NONETHELESS THEIR COURTSHIP TECHNIQUES ARE MUCH THE SAME 
AS THOSE USED IN WATER BY NEWTS 
THE MALES PRODUCE PHEROMONES THAT EXCITE THE FEMALES 
THEY DEPOSIT CAPSULES OF SPERM ON THE DAMP GROUND 
AND THE FEMALES CRAWL OVER THEM AND TAKE THEM IN 
IN DUE COURSE EACH FEMALE LAYS HER SOFT SKINNED EGGS ON THE GROUND 
HERE IT'S DAMP ENOUGH TO PREVENT HER EGGS FROM DRYING 
AND THEY'RE ALREADY DEVELOPING RAPIDLY 
EVENTUALLY THE CONTINUING RAINS FLOOD THE WOODLAND FLOOR 
BUT NOW THE FEMALE'S NEEDS AND THOSE OF HER EGGS ARE EXACTLY OPPOSITE 
THEY WILL NEED WATER IN ORDER TO BREATHE 
BUT SHE COULD DROWN IN IT SO SHE HAS TO LEAVE 
THE YOUNG INSIDE THEIR CAPSULES 
ARE DEVELOPING INTO CREATURES FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THEIR PARENTS 
A FORM THAT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF AMPHIBIANS 
THEY ARE BECOMING TADPOLES 
THEY SWIM FREE EQUIPPED WITH FEATHERY GILLS THAT ENABLE THEM TO EXTRACT OXYGEN FROM THE WATER 
THEY ARE TRULY AQUATIC CREATURES 
BUT THEY HAVE FRONT LEGS 
AS WELL AS GILLS 
AND WITHIN DAYS THEY DEVELOP BACK LEGS AS WELL 
AS TIME PASSES THEY GROW STRONGER 
THEIR GILLS WITHER AND DISAPPEAR 
AND AT LAST THEY'RE MINIATURE VERSIONS OF THEIR PARENTS 
AND ARE READY TO LEAVE THE WATER FOREVER 
AND TO START ON THEIR LAND LIVING LIVES 
BUT WHAT TEMPTED THOSE ANCIENT FISH TO LEAVE THE WATER IN THE FIRST PLACE 
FOOD 
WHEN THE FIRST AMPHIBIANS MOVED OUT OF WATER 
THE LAND WAS ALREADY SWARMING WITH INSECTS 
AND THE AMPHIBIANS HAVE EVOLVED A SPECIAL WEAPON 
WITH WHICH TO CATCH THEM 
SALAMANDERS HOWEVER HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED THE ATHLETICISM 
NEEDED FOR A HIGH SPEED CHASE AND A LIGHTNING POUNCE 
THEIR HUNTS ARE RATHER SOLEMN SEDATE AFFAIRS 
A SIMPLE CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES SURROUNDING THE TONGUE 
IS ALL THAT'S NEEDED TO SHOOT IT FORWARD 
SOME SALAMANDERS HAVE A TONGUE THAT IS ABOUT THREE QUARTERS THE LENGTH OF THEIR BODY 
BUT MOST SPECIES HAVE TO GET PRETTY CLOSE TO THEIR PREY IF THEY'RE TO CATCH IT 
ALTHOUGH THE ADULT MARBLED SALAMANDER LIVES ENTIRELY ON LAND 
IT NONETHELESS NEEDED WATER AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF ITS LIFE 
BUT THERE ARE OTHER SPECIES OF SALAMANDER IN NORTH AMERICA 
THAT HAVE MANAGED TO BREAK EVEN THAT LINK 
WITH THEIR DISTANT AQUATIC PAST 
THIS IS A GOLD MINE 
THE PEOPLE WHO DUG IT FOUND NOTHING 
BUT BIOLOGISTS WHO CAME LATER 
FOUND GOLD OF THEIR OWN SPECIAL KIND 
THEY DISCOVERED A COLONY OF A SPECIES CALLED THE SLIMY SALAMANDER 
THAT COULD BE PROPERLY OBSERVED THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER 
WHEN NORMALLY THEY'RE HIDDEN IN THE LEAF LITTER 
THEY WERE ALL FEMALES 
AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR PROVED TO BE VERY SURPRISING INDEED 
THESE SALAMANDERS COME DOWN IN EARLY SUMMER IN ABOUT JUNE 
AND WILL TRAVEL SEVERAL HUNDRED METRES DOWN ALONG THIS MINESHAFT 
TO EXACTLY THE SAME LEDGE WITHIN AN INCH OR SO 
THAT THEY USED THE PREVIOUS YEAR 
AND THEY HAVE BEEN SEEN DOING THAT FOR AT LEAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS 
AND THEY DON'T EAT 
THEY WILL STAY DOWN HERE FOR SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS 
SUSTAINED ONLY BY THE FOOD RESERVES THAT THEY'VE ACCUMULATED IN THEIR FAT TAILS 
DOWN HERE THERE IS PERMANENT MOISTURE 
HOWEVER HOT AND DRY IT GETS OUTSIDE 
THE SALAMANDERS CLEARLY PREFER TO CLUSTER TOGETHER 
CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER 
FOR THE ROCK WALLS OF THE MINESHAFT ELSEWHERE ARE TOTALLY UNINHABITED 
HOWEVER THIS OPEN PLAN WAY OF LIFE WHILE IT'S CLEARLY VERY SUCCESSFUL 
NONETHELESS COMES AT A PRICE 
SOME OF THE FEMALES HERE ARE UP TO NO GOOD 
THEY FAILED TO FATTEN UP ENOUGH DURING THE SPRING 
AND THEY'RE HUNGRY AND IN SEARCH OF A GOOD MEAL 
AND THE EGGS AND YOUNG OF THEIR OTHER SALAMANDERS 
WILL DO VERY WELL 
TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT THESE CREATURES ARE DOING 
WE NEED TO TURN OFF OUR TORCHES AND TURN ON THE INFRARED CAMERA 
HERE COMES ONE OF THOSE MARAUDING FEMALES 
SHE MUST HAVE LOCATED THIS MOTHER GUARDING HER EGGS BY SMELL 
FOR ALL THIS IS GOING ON IN TOTAL DARKNESS 
SO SOME AMPHIBIANS WHEN NEEDS BE ARE NEITHER SLUGGISH INSENSITIVE 
NOR LACKING IN MATERNAL CONCERN 
AND MOTHER WINS THE DAY 
THE SALAMANDERS' NEED TO KEEP MOIST 
MEANS THAT THEY SELDOM COME OUT INTO THE OPEN 
BUT FIND THEIR PREY BY PUSHING THROUGH THE LEAF LITTER 
AND TO DO THAT IT HELPS TO BE SLIM 
VERY SLIM 
LEGS ARE LESS IN THE WAY IF THEY'RE SMALL 
AND ONE GREAT GROUP OF BURROWING AMPHIBIANS 
HAS LOST ITS LEGS ALTOGETHER 
YOU MIGHT THINK THAT THIS WAS A GIANT EARTHWORM 
BUT IF YOU PICKED IT UP 
YOU WOULD IMMEDIATELY REALISE IT'S GOT A STRONG FIRM BACKBONE 
IT'S A CAECILIAN 
CAECILIANS ARE FOUND IN ALMOST ALL RAINFORESTS 
BUT THEY ARE SELDOM SEEN 
FOR THEY SPEND NEARLY ALL THEIR LIVES UNDERGROUND 
THE FEMALE HAVING PRODUCED HER YOUNG 
STAYS IN HER NEST CHAMBER TO PROTECT THEM 
CAECILIAN EYES ARE RUDIMENTARY 
THEY'RE COVERED IN SKIN AND SCARCELY FUNCTION 
IN THE DARKNESS UNDERGROUND HOWEVER 
THE ANIMALS HAVE NO NEED FOR THEM 
THE YOUNG ENTHUSIASTICALLY LICK A SECRETION FROM A GLAND AT THE END OF THEIR MOTHER'S TAIL 
AND THEIR CONSTANT HUNGER SEEMS TO BE THE FACTOR 
THAT KEEPS THIS LITTLE BLIND FAMILY TOGETHER 
IN A SINGLE WEEK 
THE YOUNG INCREDIBLY INCREASE THEIR WEIGHT BY TEN TIMES 
APPARENTLY JUST FROM DRINKING HER SECRETION 
BUT COULD THAT BE THEIR ONLY FOOD 
AS WE FILMED ONE OF THE YOUNGSTERS REVEALED A CLUE TO THEIR RAPID GROWTH 
IT YAWNED 
IT ALREADY HAD HOOK TEETH LIKE A BABY SHARK 
IT SURELY DOESN'T NEED THESE IF IT'S GOING TO DO NOTHING BUT DRINKING 
COULD IT BE FEEDING ON SOMETHING ELSE 
A FEW HOURS LATER OUR CAMERAS FOR THE FIRST TIME REVEALED THE ANSWER 
THERE WAS A SUDDEN FRENZY OF ACTIVITY 
THE BABIES STARTED SWARMING ALL OVER THEIR MOTHER 
THEY WERE TEARING AT HER FLANKS RIPPING OFF SEGMENTS OF HER SKIN 
SKIN THAT PROVED TO BE FULL OF FAT 
IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE REGREW HER SKIN EVERY THREE DAYS 
TO PROVIDE HER YOUNG WITH ANOTHER NOURISHING MEAL 
BLIND ELONGATED AND LEGLESS CAECILIANS MAY BE 
BUT SIMPLE INOFFENSIVE EARTHWORMS THEY ARE NOT 
THE MOST NUMEROUS AND SUCCESSFUL OF ALL AMPHIBIANS HOWEVER 
HAVE KEPT THEIR LEGS AND DEVELOPED THEM SPECTACULARLY 
SOME ARE WALKERS 
OTHERS ARE CLIMBERS 
THERE ARE HOPPERS 
THERE ARE EVEN GLIDERS 
WHO USE THE MEMBRANES ON THEIR FEET LIKE PARACHUTES 
IF THEIR SKIN IS VERY MOIST WE CALL THESE CREATURES FROGS 
IF IT'S LESS SO WE CALL THEM TOADS 
BUT THEY ALL BELONG TO THE SAME GROUP 
THERE ARE SOME FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DIFFERENT KINDS OF FROGS AND TOADS IN THE WORLD TODAY 
AND HERE IN THE LEAF LITTER IN THIS MADAGASCAN FOREST 
IS THE TINIEST OF THEM ALL 
THIS IS FULLY ADULT AND IN ITS TINY BODY 
WHICH IS ONLY A CENTIMETRE LONG 
IS PACKED A BEATING HEART 
A SKELETON A GUT A BRAIN 
IT'S A MIRACLE OF MINIATURISATION 
AND THIS BASIC BODY PLAN 
NOT ONLY COMES IN ALL SIZES 
BUT MANY DIFFERENT SHAPES 
WHICH HAS ENABLED FROGS AND TOADS 
TO COLONISE ALL KINDS 
OF DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS 
OUT OF WATER FROGS FOUND A NEW WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER 
AMPHIBIAN LUNGS ARE COMPARATIVELY FEEBLE 
SO FROGS AMPLIFY THEIR CALLS WITH CHEEK OR THROAT POUCHES 
WHICH ACT AS RESONATORS 
THE CALL OF A FROG IN THIS SOUTH AFRICAN POOL 
CAN BE HEARD OVER A MILE AWAY 
IT'S THE PAINTED REED FROG THE LOUDEST CALLER OF ALL FOR HIS SIZE 
BUT A FEMALE IS NOT ONLY IMPRESSED BY THE LOUDNESS OF A MALE'S CALL 
SHE ALSO JUDGES HIM BY HOW FREQUENTLY HE MANAGES TO MAKE THAT CALL 
CALLING IS A VERY DEMANDING ACTIVITY 
REQUIRING A MALE TO INCREASE HIS ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY ABOUT TWENTY TIMES 
SO IN PICKING THE LOUDEST AND FASTEST CALLER 
THE FEMALE IS ALSO SELECTING THE FITTEST AND MOST VIGOROUS MALE 
AS THE FATHER OF HER OFFSPRING 
HE'S THE ONE 
SUCCESS AND SILENCE FOR A FEW MINUTES 
IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES HOWEVER 
CALLS NEED REINFORCING WITH GESTURES 
THE SOUND OF RUSHING WATER COULD DROWN OUT THE CALLS OF A FROG 
HOWEVER HERE IN THIS STREAM IN PANAMA 
THERE'S A SPECIES LIVING ALONGSIDE 
THAT HAS DEVELOPED A NOVEL WAY OF DEALING WITH THAT PROBLEM 
THE RARE AND WONDERFUL GOLDEN FROG 
INDIVIDUAL MALES SET UP THEIR TERRITORIES BESIDE THE RIVER 
AND THEN WAIT FOR FEMALES TO TURN UP 
AND SINCE GOOD POSITIONS FOR A TERRITORY ARE NOT COMMON 
THEY MAY HAVE TO HOLD THEM AGAINST INTRUDERS 
AND HERE ONE COMES 
JUST IN CASE HIS CALL IS INAUDIBLE 
HE MAKES HIS MESSAGE CLEAR WITH A WAVE 
AND HIS RIVAL WAVES BACK 
HE REPEATS HIS MESSAGE SO THERE'S NO MISUNDERSTANDING 
BUT RIVAL IS NOT DETERRED 
WELL THAT MAKES THINGS PERFECTLY CLEAR 
ANOTHER ARRIVES 
PERHAPS AT LAST THIS IS A FEMALE 
NO IT'S ANOTHER MALE SO THERE WILL HAVE TO BE A WRESTLING MATCH 
THAT SHOULD TEACH HIM 
HIS RIVAL SIGNALS SUBMISSION BY KEEPING HIS HEAD DOWN 
NOW WHERE ARE THOSE FEMALES 
AND HERE SHE IS 
SHE IS PURE UNBLEMISHED GOLD AND MUCH BIGGER THAN HE IS 
WHILE HE IS FULLY OCCUPIED ANOTHER CHALLENGER ARRIVES 
SINCE HE'S ALREADY IN POSITION 
THERE'S NO POINT IN BREAKING AWAY FOR ANOTHER WRESTLING MATCH 
SO HE HANGS ON 
THE GOLDEN FROG HAS A POWERFUL POISON IN ITS SKIN 
SO IT CAN AFFORD TO BE CONSPICUOUS 
BUT MOST FROGS FIND SAFETY IN CAMOUFLAGE 
THIS IS A SOUTH AMERICAN RED EYED TREE FROG 
A CLOSE MATCH FOR THE LEAVES ON WHICH IT HABITUALLY SITS 
THE EGGS ARE NOT VERY CONSPICUOUS EITHER 
JUST LITTLE BLOBS IN TRANSPARENT JELLY 
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS LAID OVER WATER 
THEY DEVELOP VERY RAPIDLY 
IN LESS THAN A WEEK THEY'VE BECOME RECOGNISABLE TADPOLES 
ALMOST READY FOR FREEDOM 
THEN THE JELLY LIQUEFIES AND THEY SIMPLY DROP INTO THE WATER BENEATH 
BUT SOME DON'T SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH TO DO SO 
WASPS RAID THE CLUSTER 
AND CARRY OFF THE UNHATCHED TADPOLES TO FEED THEIR YOUNG 
BUT THE TADPOLES ARE NOT ENTIRELY HELPLESS 
BY THE TIME THEY'RE FIVE DAYS OLD THEY KNOW WHEN THEY'RE UNDER ATTACK 
AND WHAT'S MORE THEY CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
THERE 
QUICK WRIGGLE AND THE TADPOLE DROPS TO SAFETY 
THE ALARM SPREADS QUICKLY THROUGH THE WHOLE CLUSTER 
AND THEY ALL TAKE A DIVE 
THEIR TAILS ARE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED 
BUT THEY CAN SWIM WELL ENOUGH TO TAKE REFUGE 
BENEATH THE LEAVES OF THE WATER PLANTS 
SO IF THERE'S A CHOICE BETWEEN BEING CARRIED OFF BY A WASP 
AND TAKING AN EARLY BATH THERE'S NO COMPETITION 
BUT NOT ALL FROGS ABANDON THEIR YOUNG 
IF YOU'RE BIG ENOUGH YOU CAN STAY AND DEFEND THEM 
AND THE MALE GIANT AFRICAN BULLFROG IS AS BIG AS A FOOTBALL 
HIS POOL WHICH FORMED DURING THE RAINY SEASON 
LIES NEAR THE MARGIN OF A MUCH BIGGER POND 
THE NURSERY POOL WAS A GOOD PLACE TO LAY 
FOR IT HAD NONE OF THE PREDATORS THAT ABOUND IN THE BIGGER PERMANENT POND 
BUT AS THE DRY SEASON WARMS UP 
THAT SMALLER POOL BEGINS TO EVAPORATE 
TADPOLES ARE NOW IN REAL DANGER 
FATHER TAKES ACTION 
HE STARTS TO DIG A CANAL 
TO ENABLE HIS ENDANGERED TADPOLES TO REACH THE DEEPER POND NEARBY 
IT WILL BE TOUCH AND GO BUT IF THEY CAN ONLY GET TO THE BIGGER POND 
THEY'RE NOW VIGOROUS ENOUGH TO HAVE A REASONABLE CHANCE OF SURVIVAL 
BREAKTHROUGH 
AND FATHER LEADS THE WAY 
IN THE RAINFORESTS OF SOUTH AMERICA 
THE DAILY RAINS CREATE A MULTITUDE OF TINY POOLS 
IN THE CENTRE OF MANY PLANTS 
THIS TINY POISON ARROW FROG IS CARRYING HIS TADPOLE PIGGY BACK 
IT HATCHED ON A LEAF AND NOW HE'S TAKING IT TO A POOL IN A BROMELIAD 
HIGH UP IN THE BRANCHES 
THE TADPOLE WRIGGLES OFF 
HE MAY HAVE HALF A DOZEN BABIES 
EACH OF WHICH HE PUTS INTO ITS OWN TINY POOL 
HE MAKES REGULAR TOURS OF ALL HIS NURSERIES 
CHECKING ON HIS TADPOLES' WELFARE 
THIS YOUNGSTER IS HUNGRY 
AND TELLS HIM SO BY NIBBLING HIS LEGS AND VIBRATING AGAINST HIS BODY 
BUT THE MALE CAN'T FEED THE TADPOLE HIMSELF HE NEEDS HELP 
HE HAS TO FIND A FEMALE 
THERE SHE IS 
HE CALLS 
AND SHE FOLLOWS 
HE HAS TO LEAD 
FOR ONLY HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE HE DEPOSITED EACH TADPOLE 
THIS ONE IS NOW VERY HUNGRY INDEED 
HE CALLS TO THE FEMALE ENCOURAGINGLY 
SHE JUMPS IN PERHAPS TO ASSESS THE SITUATION 
OUT SHE COMES 
WITHOUT HAVING DONE WHAT'S REQUIRED SO HE KEEPS CALLING 
IN SHE GOES A SECOND TIME 
THIS TIME SHE PRODUCES FOOD FOR THE HUNGRY TADPOLE 
AN INFERTILE EGG 
THERE 
OUT SHE COMES AND MOTHER AND FATHER EMBRACE 
BABY HAS ITS DINNER 
AUSTRALIA IN THE SOUTH EAST HAS TEMPERATE RAINFORESTS 
A CLUSTER OF FROGS' EGGS ON THE DAMP GROUND 
WHEN THESE HATCH THE TADPOLES WILL ALSO NEED A MOIST NURSERY 
FATHER A MARSUPIAL FROG IS ON GUARD 
THE EGGS ARE DEVELOPING FAST 
THE MALE HAS TO KEEP A CAREFUL EYE ON THEM 
FOR HE MUST BE CLOSE BESIDE THEM AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THEY HATCH 
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG WAIT 
AT LEAST ELEVEN DAYS 
HE SEEMS TO HAVE DECIDED THAT THE CRUCIAL MOMENT HAS ARRIVED 
AND LOWERS HIMSELF ONTO THE EGGS 
AS HE DOES SO THE TOUGH EGG MEMBRANES LIQUEFY 
AND THE YOUNG WRIGGLE FREE 
HE HAS TWO POUCHES IN HIS SKIN ONE ON EACH HIP 
AND THE TADPOLES START TO SQUIRM INTO THEM 
COMPETITION BETWEEN THE TADPOLES IS INTENSE 
FOR THERE ARE MORE OF THEM THAN HE CAN ACCOMMODATE IN HIS POUCHES 
AT LAST HE'S TAKEN ON BOARD AS MANY AS HE CAN MANAGE 
HE WILL NOW LOOK AFTER THEM FOR UP TO SIX WEEKS 
THE YOUNG REMAIN IN HIS POUCHES CONTINUING THEIR DEVELOPMENT 
FUELLED BY THE REMAINS OF THE YOLK IN THEIR INFANT STOMACHS 
AND THEN ONE NIGHT HIS BEHAVIOUR CHANGES 
HIS FLANKS ARE RIPPLING 
THE FIRST OF HIS YOUNG IS EMERGING 
THE PROFOUND TRANSFORMATION 
THAT CONVERTED A TADPOLE INTO THIS YOUNG FROG 
TOOK PLACE ENTIRELY WITHIN ITS FATHER'S MOIST POUCH 
THE PARCHED BUSH COUNTRY OF SOUTHERN AFRICA 
HERE IT RAINS ONLY TWICE A YEAR AND THEN ONLY BRIEFLY 
BUT WHEN IT DOES THE GROUND IN PLACES ERUPTS 
RAIN FROGS AS THEY'RE APTLY CALLED 
HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS BELOW GROUND FOR THIS MOMENT 
AFTER STARVING FOR SO LONG THEY'RE KEEN TO FEED 
AS DARKNESS FALLS THE MALES BEGIN TO CALL 
FEMALES ARE FAT WITH EGGS 
THE MALES ARE SO MUCH SMALLER THAT THEY CAN'T EMBRACE A FEMALE 
SO THEY PRODUCE GLUE FROM GLANDS ON THEIR UNDERSIDE 
AND STICK THEMSELVES TO THEIR PARTNER'S BACK 
BUT SOMETIMES THAT ONLY RESULTS IN A CHAIN OF ENTHUSIASTIC 
BUT UNDISCRIMINATING MALES STUCK TO ONE ANOTHER 
THEIR BRIEF TIME ABOVE GROUND HAS COME TO AN END 
THE FEMALE STARTS TO DIG 
THE DIMINUTIVE MALE BEING STUCK ON GOES WITH HER 
HE WILL FERTILISE THE EGGS LATER BELOW GROUND 
HER STAY ON THE SURFACE IS OVER 
THE FEMALE HAS EXCAVATED A LITTLE CHAMBER FOR HERSELF 
AND BELOW THAT SHE'S MADE A SECOND ONE 
WHICH SHE'S FILLED WITH A FROTHY FOAM 
THIS IS THE NURSERY FOR HER TADPOLES 
THE FEMALE STAYS UNDERGROUND AWAY FROM THE LETHAL HEAT 
FOR SEVERAL MORE WEEKS 
BY NOW HER OFFSPRING HAVE ALMOST COMPLETED THEIR TIME AS TADPOLES 
THE RAINS RETURN 
BELOW GROUND THE YOUNGSTERS AWAIT THEIR RELEASE 
THE FEMALE LEADS THE WAY 
AND HER BROOD ARE WITH HER 
RAIN IS EVEN RARER IN AUSTRALIA 
THERE IN THE CENTRAL DESERTS IT MAY NOT FALL FOR YEARS ON END 
BUT THERE ARE AMPHIBIANS EVEN HERE 
LITTLE TOADS THAT REMAIN UNDERGROUND 
IN A STATE OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION FOR YEARS 
JUST TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A FEW RAINY DAYS 
AFTER THE RAINS HAVE FALLEN SPADEFOOT TOADS ALL EMERGE TOGETHER 
THEY MUST FEED AND BREED IF POSSIBLE BEFORE THE SUN RISES 
BUT THE DESERT DRIES ONLY TOO QUICKLY 
EVEN AFTER THE HEAVIEST OF STORMS 
TEMPERATURES RISE TO FIFTY DEGREES CENTIGRADE 
NOW WATER WILL EVAPORATE INSTANTLY 
THIS IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST PLACES ON EARTH 
SO THE TOADS HAVE TO RETREAT ONCE AGAIN BELOW GROUND 
THE MIRACLE IS THAT THEY'RE HERE AT ALL 
A TOAD THAT CAN LIVE IN AS PARCHED A DESERT AS THIS 
IS IMPRESSIVE EVIDENCE OF THE VERSATILITY OF THE AMPHIBIANS 
THE WAY THEY CAN ADAPT THEIR BEHAVIOUR AND THEIR ANATOMY 
TO LIVE SO FAR AWAY FROM WATER 
BUT THERE'S ONE GROUP OF ANIMALS THAT CAN REALLY CALL THE DESERT THEIR OWN THE LIZARDS 
AND WE'LL LOOK AT THEM IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF LIFE IN COLD BLOOD 
AMPHIBIANS ARE THE MOST THREATENED GROUP OF VERTEBRATES ON THE PLANET 
IN RECENT YEARS 
A STRANGE AND LETHAL FUNGAL DISEASE HAS STARTED TO SPREAD AMONG THEM 
THE GOLDEN FROG WHICH LIVES ONLY IN ONE SMALL AREA IN PANAMA 
WAS IN PARTICULAR DANGER 
AS THE DISEASE IS ALREADY ON THE FRONTIER OF ITS TERRITORY 
IF WE WERE TO FILM IT AT ALL WE WOULD HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY 
FOR SERIES PRODUCER MILES BARTON THAT MEANT CUTTING SHORT CHRISTMAS 
WE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT IN PANAMA THE FROGS' FEW REMAINING BREEDING STREAMS 
WERE BEING RAPIDLY DESTROYED BY THE BUILDING OF A NEW ROAD 
MAKING THE LAST TINY POPULATION EVEN MORE AT RISK FROM THE DISEASE 
THE FUNGUS CLOGS THE ANIMAL'S MOIST SKIN 
SINCE ALL FROGS BREATHE THROUGH THEIR SKIN 
INFECTED ANIMALS DIE FROM SUFFOCATION 
FROG BIOLOGIST ERIK LINDQUIST 
WHO FIRST DESCRIBED THE GOLDEN FROG'S SIGNALLING BEHAVIOUR 
HELPED THE FILM TEAM TO THOROUGHLY DISINFECT THEIR KIT 
BEFORE TRAVELLING INTO THE FROGS' TERRITORY 
FRESHLY SCRUBBED UP ERIK TOOK THE TEAM TO ONE OF THE GOLDEN FROG'S LAST KNOWN BREEDING SITES 
BUT WOULD THEY STILL BE THERE 
YEAH YOU HEAR THAT THAT'S A MALE CALLING 
WE HAVE ANOTHER MALE CRAWLING UP OVER HERE 
CRAWLING UP THE ROCK FACE 
BUT WITH THE FUNGUS APPROACHING AT A RATE OF UP TO TWENTY FIVE MILES A YEAR 
THE FROGS WERE RAPIDLY DISAPPEARING FROM ALL THEIR KNOWN BREEDING SITES 
THE ADVANCE CREW IMMEDIATELY SET ABOUT FILMING 
AS MUCH OF THE BEHAVIOUR AS THEY COULD 
BY THE TIME I ARRIVED 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE REMAINING LOCATION WHERE THE FROGS SURVIVED 
WHERE EXACTLY ARE WE GOING 
I WOULD PREFER NOT SAYING PRECISELY 
YOU SEE THIS IS REALLY THE LAST POPULATION OF THE GOLDEN FROG LEFT IN THE WILD 
AND HISTORICALLY THE LOCALS HAVE BEEN COLLECTING OUT THESE ANIMALS 
AS GOOD LUCK TALISMAN AND SO NOW WE'RE LEFT WITH JUST ONE POPULATION 
I'M CONCERNED THAT IF THE SECRET LOCALITY GETS GIVEN OUT 
THERE'LL BE INTERNATIONAL COLLECTORS THAT WOULD COME REALLY 
SURE THEY'RE RARE ENOUGH NOW 
WHERE MANY PEOPLE WOULD PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR THESE ANIMALS 
WERE THEY EVER WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL COMMON 
WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HERE IN THE PAST 
THE POPULATIONS WERE SO ABUNDANT THAT ONE WOULD HAVE TO WATCH WHERE THEY'RE STEPPING TO KEEP FROM KILLING ONE 
REALLY YES YES 
ERIK HAS HIS OWN LOW TECH METHOD OF FINDING THEM 
WHICH HE ASSURES ME NORMALLY WORKS 
SEE WHEN YOU CALL SOMETIMES THEY'LL CALL BACK 
AND THEY'LL REVEAL THEIR LOCATIONS 
SOMETIMES THEY'RE TUCKED AWAY BEHIND LEAVES 
AND THEY'RE REALLY DIFFICULT TO FIND 
HOPEFULLY WE CAN ELICIT A RESPONSE 
IT'S THE FASTEST WAY TO GET THEM TO SHUT UP 
WAS THAT HIM YEAH LISTEN 
SO THEY'RE HERE THEY'RE HERE 
THERE'S ONE OVER THERE 
SEE HIM RIGHT THERE LOOKS LIKE A MALE 
MAKE HIM DO IT AGAIN 
YOU HAVE TO HUM AND WHISTLE AT THE SAME TIME CAN'T DO IT 
SEE IF HE CAN 
NOW WE KNEW THE FROGS WERE STILL HERE WE COULD COMPLETE THE FILMING 
THE LOCAL PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS TREASURED THEIR REMARKABLE LITTLE FROG 
BUT ERIK WAS THE FIRST TO DOCUMENT ITS SIGNALLING BEHAVIOUR 
IT WAS AN ANIMAL THAT WAS JUST WALKING 
I WASN'T SURE IF THE ANIMAL WAS TRYING TO FLUSH OUT PREY 
OR IF IT WAS USING IT IN A COMMUNICATION ROLE 
AND SO A GROUP OF US SET OUT TO LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAS COMMUNICATION 
WE TRIED MIRROR PRESENTATIONS TO THE ANIMALS 
WHEN YOU PRESENTED THEM WITH A MIRROR 
THEY WOULD HAND WAVE AT THE MIRROR 
AS OPPOSED TO SAY THE BACKSIDE OF A MIRROR THAT WASN'T REFLECTIVE 
SOME OF US HAVE LOOKED SPECIFICALLY AT AN L. C. D. SCREEN 
A LITTLE TELEVISION WITH A HAND WAVING SEMAPHORING FROG 
AND IT HAS ELICITED A NUMBER OF RESPONSES SPECIFICALLY FROM MALES 
WHAT YOU SHOW A TELEVISION PICTURE TO A MALE AND HE WAVES BACK 
HE WAVES BACK AND HE'LL EVEN CALL TO THE MALE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN 
REALLY IT'S REALLY FASCINATING 
THEY THEN EXPERIMENTED WITH A LIFE SIZE PLASTIC MODEL 
COMPLETE WITH WAVING ARM 
THE SORT OF HIGH TECH GEAR I THOUGHT I MIGHT MANAGE TO OPERATE MYSELF 
IT'S NOT AS EASY AS YOU MIGHT THINK 
ERIK SHOWED ME HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET THAT SLOW MOTION WAVE JUST RIGHT 
THE FROGS WAVED 
THEY CALLED 
THEY EVEN ATTACKED 
SO THAT WAVE REALLY IS A FORM OF COMMUNICATION 
SO THEY'RE JUST SAYING KEEP OFF KEEP OFF 
HUH IS THAT RIGHT 
WE'RE NOT SURE 
SOMETIMES THERE SEEM TO BE CERTAIN HAND WAVES THAT MAY INDICATE APPEASEMENT 
SHOWING THAT I'M JUST WALKING THROUGH PERHAPS YOUR TERRITORY 
DON'T BOTHER ME 
REALLY AH PLEASE 
BUT HOW ENDANGERED IS THE GOLDEN FROG 
THIS IS IT WHAT YOU SEE 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE LAST CREW TO FILM THESE IN THE WILD 
AND INDEED WE WERE 
SOON AFTER FINISHING FILMING 
THE LOCAL SCIENTISTS DECIDED THE TIME HAD COME 
TO TAKE ALL THE SURVIVING GOLDEN FROGS INTO CAPTIVITY 
BEFORE THE FUNGUS ARRIVES HERE AND KILLS THEM ALL 
THEY AND OTHER RARE SPECIES OF FROG ALSO THREATENED 
WERE BEING BROUGHT BACK TO A SPECIAL FROG HOSPITAL 
WHERE I WAS INTRODUCED TO SOME OF THE OTHER PATIENTS 
SO WHAT ARE THESE 
THEY'RE NOCTURNAL SO THEY SPEND 
HERE THEY'RE BEING TREATED DAILY WITH A FUNGICIDE 
BUT WITHOUT A VACCINE TO PROTECT THEM 
AND WITH THE FUNGUS STILL AT LARGE IN THE FOREST 
THEY CAN'T BE RE INTRODUCED INTO THEIR PROPER HOME 
FROGS SO COMMON IN THESE HUMID FORESTS 
ARE CRUCIAL LINKS IN THE ECOLOGY 
IF THEY DISAPPEAR ALL KINDS OF FOOD CHAINS WILL BE BROKEN 
THE EFFECT COULD BE LITTLE SHORT OF CATASTROPHIC TO WILDLIFE IN GENERAL 
AND SADLY FOR NOW AT LEAST 
IT SEEMS THAT THE GOLDEN FROG HAS WAVED ITS LAST IN THE WILD 
NEXT WEEK JOIN ME FOR THE STORY OF THE SPECTACULAR LIZARDS 
THE DRAGONS OF THE DRY 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET 
YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
