ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED SCALE THE 
COURT HEARD THAT THE GANG PLANNED 
TO TAKE EXPLOSIVES DISGUISED AS 
SOFT DRINKS ON BOARD TRANSATLANTIC 
FLIGHTS FROM HEATHROW THE 
PROSECUTION SAID THE MEN HAD 
IDENTIFIED SEVEN FLIGHTS AS TARGETS 
AND THAT AS MANY AS EIGHTEEN SUICIDE 
BOMBERS WERE PLANNING TO BLOW 
THEMSELVES UP OVER THE ATLANTIC 
INFLICTING HUNDREDS OF CIVILIAN 
CASUALTIES DANIEL SANDFORD JOINS 
US FROM OUTSIDE WOOLWICH CROWN 
COURT COURT THE PROSECUTION SAY THE MEN FROM 
EAST LONDON WERE PLANNING TO KILL 
HUNDREDS OF AIRLINE PASSENGERS IN 
SUICIDE ATTACKS THE BOMBS WERE TO 
BE SOFT DRINKS BOTTLES LIKE THIS 
WITH LIQUID EXPLOSIVES INSIDE THEY 
WERE TO BE SMUGGLED THROUGH 
SECURITY AND DETONATED ONCE THE 
PLANE WAS IN THE AIR KILLING 
EVERYONE ON BOARD 
THESE ARE THE MEN ACCUSED OF 
PLANNING A TERRORIST ACT THAT WOULD 
HAVE LED TO CIVILIAN DEATH TOLL ON 
AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE A PLOT 
WHICH THE PROSECUTION SAY THEY WERE 
NEARLY READY TO PUT INTO PRACTICE

COULD CARRY A MAXIMUM OF BETWEEN 
TWO HUNDRED FORTY AND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY PEOPLE THE MEN HAD

RELAXED THE PROSECUTION SAY THAT 
SINCE THE FIRST SUICIDE BOMBER 
WOULD ONLY HAVE DETONATED HIS

AIRBORNE THE AUTHORITIES WOULD 
HAVE BEEN POWERLESS TO PREVENT THE 
OTHER FLIGHTS BEING DESTROYED 
ALTHOUGH SEVEN AIRCRAFT HAD BEEN 
IDENTIFIED THE MEN HAD TALKED OF UP 
TO EIGHTEEN SUICIDE BOMBERS 
PETER WRIGHT TOLD THE JURY HERE 
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A VIOLENT AND 
DEADLY STATEMENT OF INTENT THAT 
WOULD HAVE HAD A TRULY GLOBAL 
IMPACT THESE ARE MEN WITH THE 
COLD EYED CERTAINTY OF THE FANATIC

ZIMBABWE'S PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE 
HAS APPEARED ON STATE TELEVISION 
THE FIRST TIME HE'S BEEN SEEN IN 
PUBLIC FOR SEVERAL DAYS THERE ARE 
STILL NO OFFICIAL RESULTS FROM THE 
FIRST ROUND OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION BUT MR. MUGABE'S PARTY HAS 
INSISTED IF IT IS NOT DECISIVE HE 
WILL FIGHT A SECOND ROUND GEORGE 
ALAGIAH JOINS US FROM NEIGHBOURING 
SOUTH AFRICA 
THANK YOU IF THERE WERE ANY 
ZIMBABWEANS NAIVE ENOUGH TO THINK 
ROBERT MUGABE WOULD GIVE UP WITHOUT 
A FIGHT THEY NEED TO THINK AGAIN 
HIS SPOKESMAN SAID TODAY THAT THE 
PARTY WOULD UNLEASH ITS FULL MIGHT 
TO ENSURE THAT ROBERT MUGABE COULD 
LOOK FORWARD TO A FOURTH DECADE IN 
POWER THAT'S GOING TO RING ALARM 
BELLS THE THOUGHT OF THE RULING 
PARTY AT FULL THROTTLE PEOPLE WILL 
REMEMBER THE VIOLENCE IT'S BEEN 
ASSOCIATED WITH DESPITE THAT BAN 
ON THE B. B. C. REPORTING FROM ZIMBABWE 
OUR WORLD AFFAIRS EDITOR JOHN 
SIMPSON IS THERE AND HE REPORTS NOW 
ON THE DAY ROBERT MUGABE'S PARTY 
BEGAN TO HIT BACK 
ROBERT MUGABE MADE HIS FIRST 
OFFICIAL APPEARANCE SINCE 
SATURDAY'S ELECTION MEETING 
AFRICAN DIGNITARIES AND EXPRESSING 
HIS THANKS FOR THE WORK OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS 
IF HE WAS WORRIED HE DIDN'T SHOW 
IT 
HE LOOKED VERY RELAXED AND HE IT IS OF THE VIEW THAT THE PROBLEMS OF 
THE COUNTRY WILL BE RESOLVED AND HE 
WAS VERY RELAXED 
THE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION HAD UNTIL TOMORROW TO 
ANNOUNCE THE PRESIDENTIAL RESULT 
THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTIONS 
IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN UNTIL MONDAY 
ZANU P. F. LEADERS ALSO MEET TOMORROW 
TO PLAN THEIR STRATEGY AND EVERYONE 
WILL BE WAITING TO SEE WHAT MR. 
MUGABE DOES IT IS ASSUMED HE WILL 
CHAIR THE MEETING IF A RUN OFF 
ELECTION IS CALLED THE LAW SAYS 
THIS MUST TAKE PLACE WITHIN THREE 
WEEKS IT COULD MEAN THE 
INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE SIMBA MAKONI 
WOULD BE A KINGMAKER IF HE SIDES 
WITH THE M. D. C. MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS 
LIKELY TO WIN IF HE PREFERS ZANU 
P. F. ROBERT MUGABE MIGHT JUST CLING 
ON TO POWER THE GOVERNMENT 
CONTROLLED HERALD MAKES A FAMILIAR 
CLAIM BUT THIS LINE DOESN'T 
CONVINCE EVERYONE 
I THINK IT IS 
TIME FOR A CHANGE WE NEED A CHANGE 
THE ECONOMY IS SO LOW WE ARE 
HOPING FOR SOMETHING WHICH WILL 
REVIVE THE ECONOMY 
BUT WHEN THE 
OFFICIAL MEDIA ADMIT THAT ROBERT 
MUGABE HAS A REAL FIGHT ON HIS 
HANDS MOST PEOPLE HERE SEEM TO 
FEEL THAT CHANGE MUST BE IN THE AIR 
THE QUESTION IS WILL MR. MUGABE 
ACCEPT DEFEAT TAMELY AND STEP 
ASIDE ASIDE JOHN WE ARE GETTING REPORTS HERE 
IN JOHANNESBURG THAT THE SECURITY 
SITUATION INSIDE ZIMBABWE IS 
GETTING MORE DIFFICULT ARE YOU 
SENSING THAT 
YES IT'S BEEN REALLY 
IN THE LAST HOUR GEORGE WE HAVE 
BEEN GETTING REPORTS OF PEOPLE 
BEING ARRESTED AND STOPPED AT THE 
AIRPORT IN THE CASE OF TWO ELECTION 
MONITORING OFFICIALS IT SEEMS 
DIRECTED MORE TOWARDS THE M. D. C. THAN 
IT DOES TOWARDS SAY FOREIGN 
JOURNALISTS THERE ARE QUITE A FEW 
FOREIGN JOURNALISTS NOW WHO HAVE 
COME HERE AS WE HAVE AND ARE 
REPORTING WITHOUT THE KIND OF 
NECESSARY CREDENTIALS BUT THE 
CLAMPDOWN SEEMS TO BE DIRECTED 
TOWARDS A GROUP OF M. D. C. PEOPLE AT A 
PARTICULAR HOTEL HERE IN HARARE WHO 
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLATING THE 
FIGURES THAT SHOWED OR APPEARED TO 
SHOW THAT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI THE 
OPPOSITION CANDIDATE HAD WON THE 
PRESIDENCY YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT 
PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY WHICH 
THEY ANNOUNCED IT THE PEOPLE THAT 
PRODUCED THE FIGURES SEEM TO HAVE 
BEEN THE MAJOR TARGET FOR THIS 
CLAMPDOWN CLAMPDOWN JOHN THE RULING PARTY SAYS IF 
THERE IS SECOND ROUND IT WILL 
FIGHTBACK STRONG ARE YOU CLEAR 
THAT THE PARTY FULLY SUPPORTS 
ROBERT MUGABE AT THE MOMENT 
NO IT 
CERTAINLY DOESN'T FULLY SUPPORT HIM 
ALTHOUGH IF IT'S OBVIOUS THAT HE'S 
GOING TO WIN OR ANNOUNCE THAT HE'S 
WON THEN I THINK MOST OF THE 
PEOPLE THAT ARE NOW LOOKING IN 
OTHER DIRECTIONS FOR SOME KIND OF 
POLITICAL FUTURE WILL COME BACK TO 
HIM PRETTY QUICKLY L. SPOKE TO A 
QUITE SENIOR ZANU P. F. SOURCE TODAY 
WHO SAID THAT HE THOUGHT THAT 
EVERYBODY IN THE TOP LEADERSHIP WAS 
STARTING TO FEEL THAT THEY OUGHT TO 
LOOK IN ONE DIRECTION OR ANOTHER 
THAT THEY SHOULDN'T PUT ALL THEIR 
EGGS IN ONE BASKET L. THINK IT 
DEPENDS HOW DETERMINED ROBERT 
MUGABE IS TO JUST CRACKDOWN SEIZE 
POWER AND SIT HERE AND SAY LOOK 
I DON'T CARE WHAT THE FIGURES SAY 
I'M THE PRESIDENT 
ALL RIGHT JOHN THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH THAT IS ABOUT IT FROM US 
BACK TO YOU 
NOW SHOULD CANNABIS BE RECLASSIFIED 
AS MORE SERIOUS DRUG CURRENTLY 
IT IS CLASS C. THAT IS THE LOWEST 
CATEGORY SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS 
SAY THAT SENDS OUT THE WRONG 
MESSAGE AND SUGGESTS THAT THE DRUG 
IS HARMLESS THEY WANT IT UPGRADED 
TO CLASS B. AS DOES THE PRIME 
MINISTER TODAY THE B. B. C. LEARNED 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN ADVISORS 
SAY IT SHOULD STAY JUST WHERE IT IS 
MARK EASTON JOINS US TO EXPLAIN 
IT MIGHT COME AS A SURPRISE 
PERHAPS BUT SINCE CANNABIS WAS 
DOWNGRADED GOVERNMENT FIGURES 
SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT FALL IN ITS 
USE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE JUST BEFORE 
DOWNGRADING ELEVEN PER CENT OF BRITISH ADULTS 
REPORTED USING THE DRUGS LAST YEAR 
IT WAS EIGHT PER CENT AMONG YOUNGER PEOPLE 
REPORTED USE FELL FROM TWENTY FIVE PER CENT DOWN TO 
TWENTY ONE PER CENT MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE BEING 
TREATED FOR CANNABIS PROBLEMS 
PARTICULARLY USE OF THE POWERFUL 
SKUNK FORM OF THE DRUG 
CANNABIS CONTAINS TWO KEY 
INGREDIENTS KNOWN AS T. H. C. AND 
CANNABINOID A RECENT B. B. C. 
DOCUMENTARY COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF 
EACH INJECTED WITH MIXTURE 
NICKY TAYLOR BECAME RELAXED AND 
GIGGLY A DOSE OF PURE T. H. C. MADE HER 
FEEL PERSECUTED AND SUICIDAL 
IT IS 
JUST SO DEPRESSING YOU WOULD WANT 
TO TOP YOURSELF 
BOBBY IS 
RECOVERING FROM ADDICTION TO SKUNK 
AND BELIEVES THE DRUG IS MUCH MORE 
HARMFUL THAN PEOPLE REALISE 
I HAVE 
REALLY LOST THE PLOT AND STARTED 
HEARING VOICES AND HAD TO BE 
SECTIONED IT HAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL 
AFFECT ON SOMEONE WHO USES IT 
HEAVILY 
NEW RESEARCH PRESENTED TO HEAVILY THE BODY WHICH ADVISES THE 
GOVERNMENT ON DRUG CLASSIFICATION 
FOUND THAT WHEN CANNABIS USE WAS 
GOING UP SCHIZOPHRENIA RATES WERE 
GOING DOWN 
CURRENTLY DRUGS INCLUDING HEROIN 
COCAINE ECSTASY AND L. S. D. ARE CLASS 
A. CLASS B. INCLUDES AMPHETAMINES 
AND CANNABIS IS IN CLASS C. NOW THE 
HIGHER THE CLASSIFICATION THE 
LONGER THE JAIL TERM IF YOU ARE 
CAUGHT IN POSSESSION ORDEALING BUT 
RECENTLY INDEPENDENT EXPERTS CAME 
UP WITH ANOTHER SYSTEM COMPARING 
THE HARM DRUGS CAUSE AND UNDER 
THEIR SYSTEM ECSTASY AND L. S. D. MOVE 
WAY DOWN THE SCALE WHILE LEGAL 
DRUGS ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO ARE 
REGARDED AS MORE HARMFUL THAN 
CANNABIS 
WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO CANNABIS HERE WE SHOULD BE IF WE ARE 
TRYING TO SEND OUT MESSAGES WE 
SHOULD BE USING PUBLIC EDUCATION 
TARGETING VULNERABLE GROUPS AND 
TRYING TO EDUCATE THEM ABOUT THE 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUGS ONLY ONLY YESTERDAY THE PRIME MINISTER 
GORDON BROWN EXPRESSED HIS VIEW 
THAT CANNABIS SHOULD BE 
RECLASSIFIED AN OPINION SHARED BY 
MANY POLICE OFFICERS IT SEEMS 
INEVITABLE THAT HE WILL BE AT ODDS 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S EXPERT ADVICE 
PROMPTING A NEW DEBATE ON THE BEST 
WAY TO REDUCE THE HARM DRUGS CAUSE 
THE STEPFATHER OF SHANNON MATTHEWS 
THE SCHOOLGIRL WHO DISAPPEARED FOR 
MORE THAN THREE WEEKS HAS APPEARED 
IN COURT CHARGED WITH POSSESSING 
INDECENT IMAGES OF CHILDREN CRAIG 
MEE MAN WAS REMANDED IN KUST 
CRAIG MEEHAN WAS REMANDED IN 
CUSTODY CUSTODY AFTER A NIGHT IN THE CELLS CRAIG 
MEEHAN LEFT DEWSBURY POLICE STATION 
FOR THE SHORT TRIP TO THE TOWN'S 
MAGISTRATES HAVING BEEN QUESTIONED 
AND CHARGED BY DETECTIVES HE WAS 
BROUGHT TO THE COURT TO HEAR BRIEF 
DETAILS OF THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM 
SHANNON MATTHEWS' STEPFATHER IS 
ACCUSED OF ELEVEN OFFENCES OF 
POSSESSING INDECENT IMAGES THEY 
RELATE TO ONE HUNDRED FORTY PICTURES FOUND ON 
COMPUTERS TAKEN FROM HIS HOME NO 
APPLICATION WAS MADE FOR BAIL AND 
HE WILL STAY IN CUSTODY UNTIL A 
SECOND HEARING NEXT FRIDAY 
THIS IS WHERE CRAIG MEEHAN WAS 
ARRESTED YESTERDAY AND THIS IS ALSO 
THE HOME OF SHANNON MATTHEWS WE 
UNDERSTAND THAT WITHIN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR 
HOURS SHANNON HAS SPENT A FEW HOURS 
WITH HER MOTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IN SIX WEEKS 
AND ACCORDING TO CAR REASON 
KAREN'S FRIENDS OUTSIDE COURT IT 
WAS A VERY SPECIAL MEETING 
SHE WAS 
JOINING IN PLAY FROM WHAT I CAN 
GATHER SHE CAME OUT VERY HAPPY 
SHE WAS ABLE TO TOUCH 
SHANNON 
YES YES IT WAS JUST SHANNON NORMAL CONTACT 
BUT FOR THE TIME 
BEING NINE YEAR OLD SHANNON 
REMAINS IN THE CARE OF SOCIAL 
SERVICES WITH STILL NO OFFICIAL 
COMMENT ON HER FUTURE 
BRITISH AIRWAYS SAYS IT IS PLANNING 
TO OPERATE A FULL SERVICE OF 
FLIGHTS FROM THE NEW TERMINAL FIVE 
ON SATURDAY IT WILL BE THE FIRST 
TIME THE TERMINAL HAS OPERATED A 
FULL SCHEDULE SINCE THE MASS 
CANCELLATION OF FLIGHTS A WEEK AGO 
THE AIRLINE SAID IT EXPECTS THE 
DISRUPTION TO COST IT SIXTEEN MILLION 
THE SCHOOLS SECRETARY FOUND A 
RATHER EYE CATCHING WAY TO SET OUT 
PLANS TO BUILD OR RENOVATE SEVERAL 
THOUSAND NEW PLAYGROUNDS ACROSS 
ENGLAND TODAY HE SAID HE WANTED TO 
BOOST PARENTS' CONFIDENCE THAT 
THEIR CHILDREN CAN PLAY OUTSIDE IN 
SAFETY SAFETY THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR TO BRITAIN 
HAS SAID SHE WILL NOT TAKE PART IN 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY THROUGH 
LONDON THIS WEEKEND IT IS THOUGHT 
SHE MAY HAVE BEEN PUT OFF BY FEARS 
OF PROTESTS ALONG THE ROUTE CHINA 
IS DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO HAVE 
A PERFECT OLYMPIC YEAR WITH ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
DAYS TO GO IT IS PROVING A 
STRUGGLE STRUGGLE TURKISH TELEVISION TELLS ITS 
VIEWERS THE TORCH IS IN TOWN IT IS 
TIME TO CELEBRATE THIS WEEKEND IT 
IS LONDON'S TURN AND IT PROMISES TO 
BE A CONTROVERSIAL EVENT 
TIBETAN CAMPAIGNERS ARE PROMISING 
TO CAMPAIGN PEACEFULLY ALONG THE 
EVENT 
I'M NOT AGAINST THE OLYMPICS EVENT IN CHINA I'M AGAINST THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH GOING INSIDE TIBET BECAUSE 
AS YOU HAVE SEEN RECENTLY IT'S 
LIKE A MASSACRE HAPPENED IN TIBET 
AND NOW TIBET IS LIKE A LOCKED 
MILITARY ZONE 
BUT IN LONDON'S 
TRAFALGAR SQUARE I MET ONE OF 
A ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO CHINESE STUDENTS IN BRITAIN 
HE HAS BEEN RALLYING SUPPORTERS IN 
FAVOUR OF LONDON'S TORCH RELAY IT IT IS HARD TO SEPARATE POLITICAL 
ISSUES FROM THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE POLITICAL 
ISSUES ARE EXAGGERATED AND 
DISTORTED LIKE IN THIS CASE THE 
WHOLE OF THE TIBETAN CRISIS IN MY 
OPINION IS EXAGGERATED 
BLAME THE 
MEDIA SAYS THIS PRO BINGE YANK 
LONDON NEWSPAPER SAYING THE 
SITUATION IN TIBET IS MISUNDERSTOOD 
THIS MORNING THE AMBASSADOR SAID 
HE WOULD NOT TAKE PART IN THE RELAY 
CITING OTHER COMMITMENTS 
THIS IS AFTER ALL CHINA'S SHOWCASE 
YEAR BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SECURITY 
IT IS NOT THE CHINESE EMBASSY BUT 
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE WHO WILL BE 
SAFEGUARDING THE PASSAGE OF THE 
FLAME THROUGH LONDON AND OF THE 
SPECTATORS THE TORCH GOES FROM 
WEMBLEY STADIUM TO THE DOME TAKING 
IN DOWNING STREET WHERE IT WILL BE 
WELCOMED BY GORDON BROWN WE ASKED 
THE POLICE IF THEY KNEW OF ANY 
PLANS TO DISRUPT THE PROCESSION 
THERE ARE PLANS AND WE'RE SAYING 
PEOPLE ARE COMING HERE TO DISRUPT 
IT BUT WE'RE SAYING WE WILL STOP 
YOU SO PLEASE DON'T DO IT THE THE POLICE WARN THEY WILL HAVE CHINESE 
INTERPRETERS ON HAND AND ANY 
INSULTING OR INCITEFUL BANNERS WILL 
BE CONFISCATED A PROMINENT 
ACTIVIST WHO PUBLICISED ARTICLES 
AGAINST COMMUNISM ACROSS CHINA HAS 
BEEN JAILED 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL ACCUSED CHINA 
OF CARRYING OUT A WAVE OF 
OPPRESSION AHEAD OF THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES THE TOP STORY TONIGHT EIGHT

SCENE OF POLICE ACTIVITY THE 
POLICE SAY PEOPLE IN THE FLATS ARE

GET AS MUCH HELP AS POSSIBLE FROM 
THE PEOPLE HERE AND THEY ARE 
PARTICULARLY KEEN TO LEARN OF HER 
LIFESTYLE AND WHAT SHALL DID DURING 
THE NIGHT TIME AND DURING THE DAY 
AND THEN THEY WILL FIND OUT WHAT 
ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO HER 
THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS OF 
GEORGIA AND UKRAINE HAVE BEEN TOLD

PROVOKE RUSSIA WHICH HAS VOICED 
STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE ALLIANCE'S 
EX PANGS 
THIS WEEKEND IS THE BAHRAIN GRAND 
PRIX BUT THERE HAS BEEN INTENSE 
SPECULATION FOLLOWING MAX MOSLEY 
AFTER GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS OVER 
HIS PRIVATE LIFE A MAN FIGHTING 
FOR HIS REPUTATION AND HIS JOB MAX 
MOSLEY HAS ALREADY APOLOGISED FOR 
ANY EMBARRASSMENT CAUSED BY THE 
REVELATIONS IN LAST WEEK'S NEWS OF 
THE WORLD IT IS CLAIMED HE TOOK 
PART IN A NAZI STYLE ORGY IN A 
DUNGEON DUNGEON MAX MOSLEY INSISTS THERE WERE NO 
NAZI CONNECTIONS TO ANYTHING THAT 
HAPPENED TODAY FOUR FORMULA ONE 
TEAMS ISSUESED STATEMENTS RAISING 
CONCERNS ABOUT MOSLEY'S BEHAVIOUR 
TWO DESCRIBED IT AS DISGRACEFUL IT IT IS NECESSARY THAT FIGURES IN SPORT 
AND BUSINESS MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST 
STANDARDS OF CONDUCT IN ORDER TO 
MAINTAIN THEIR DEUCE OF RESPECT WE 
ARE CONCERNED THAT THE REPUTATION 
OF FORMULA ONE AND ALL ITS 
PARTICIPANTS HAVE BEEN DAMAGED 
THIS WEEKEND BAR RAIN IS HOSTING A 
GRAND PRIX WHEN MOSLEY HAS 
TRAVELLED THERE IN THE PAST HE HAS 
RECEIVED A ROYAL WELCOME BUT THE 
CROWN PRINCE OF BAHRAIN HERE ON 
THE RIGHT HAS WRITTEN TO HIM 
ASKING HIM TO STAY AWAY THIS TIME 
INFORMING HIM THAT HIS PRESENCE 
THERE WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE 
MOSLEY'S REQUEST TO CALL AN 
EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL ASSEMBLY WILL 
GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO SAY THAT HE 
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY ON IN A 
STATEMENT HE SAID 
LAST YEAR MOTOR RACING HAD TO DEAL 
WITH A SPYING SAGA NOW JUST A FEW 
WEEKS INTO THE SEASON THERE ARE 
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THE 
BEHAVIOUR OF ONE OF THE SPORT'S 
MOST SENIOR FIGURES THOSE WHO WORK 
HERE RUNNING FORMULA ONE WILL BE 
DETERMINED THAT THIS ROW IS 
RESOLVED QUICKLY 
NOW THEY BOOKED ROUND THE WORLD 
CRUISE AND GOT STUCK IN ONE PORT 
BECAUSE THE OWNERS COULD NOT PAY 
THEIR BILLS BUT THE VAN GOGH 
WHICH HAS BEEN IMPOUNDED IN MADEIRA 
SINCE TUESDAY COULD BE MAKING ITS 
WAY HOME TONIGHT 
BEHIND POLICE CORDONS THE VAN GOGH 
HAS STILL NOT SET SAIL SOME OF THE 
PASSENGERS SAY THEY HAVE BEEN HELD 
TO RANSOM WHILE THE BOAT'S OWNERS 
TRY TO RESOLVE DISPUTE OVER AN 
ALLEGED DEBT 
I HAVE NO INFORMATION 
WHATSOEVER WE MAY BE HERE A 
FEW MORE DAYS MAYBE I DON'T KNOW 
HOWEVER OTHERS INCLUDING THE 
ACTRESS SHIRLEY ANNE FIELD SAY THEY 
ARE BEING WELL LOOKED AFTER THEY THEY HAVE TURNED IT INTO A TRIUMPH L. 
DON'T KNOW HOW OF COURSE WE WILL 
BE HAPPY TO GET HOME BUT IN THE 
MEAN TIME THERE ARE NOT MANY 
BETTER PLACES TO GET APPREHENDED 
THE SHIP HAS BEEN IN THE PORT OF 
FUNCHAL IN MADEIRA SINCE TUESDAY 
MY CREW HAVE DONE THE UTMOST TO 
PROVIDE A RESTFUL STAY IN FUNCHAL 
AND I HOPE MY PASSENGERS WILL LEAVE 
WITH A FOND MEMORY OF THEIR STAY ON 
BOARD 
THE LINER SET OFF ON FOURTH BOARD JANUARY FROM FALMOUTH IN CORNWALL 
IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED SIX PASSENGERS ON BOARD THE 
THREE MONTH ROUND THE WORLD TRIP 
COST UP TO NINE THOUSAND PER PERSON THE 
OWNERS SAY THEY WERE UNAWARE OF 
ALLEGATIONS THEY OWED MONEY UNTIL 
THIS WEEK AND HAVE BEEN WORKING 
HARD TO GET THE PASSENGERS HOME 
HAVING UNDERTAKEN THREE MONTHS AT 
SEA AND HAVING HAD A VERY VERY 
GOOD TIME IT WOULD BE HUGE SHAME 
TO DAMPEN THAT BY THE EXPERIENCE AT 
THE END OF IT THAT THEY ARE GOING 
THROUGH NOW YES THERE IS A HUGE 
APOLOGY FROM OURSELVES FOR THAT 
AND WE'RE DOING OUR UTMOST TO CLEAR 
THE MISUNDERSTANDING 
AND SEEMS 
THAT THIS EVENING THERE IS A 
RESOLUTION AND THE VAN GOGH MAY BE 
HEADING BACK TO THE U. K. WITHIN HOURS 
NOW A LOOK AT THE WEATHER AND THE 
MET OFFICE HAS COME OUT WITH ITS 
LONG TERM FORECAST FOR WHAT WE 
MIGHT EXPECT THIS SUMMER WHAT IS 
IT IT IT DEPENDS WHETHER YOU LIKE TO LOOK 
AT THE GLASS HALF EMPTY OR HALF 
FULL 
THE TEMPERATURES COULD BE WARMER 
THAN AVERAGE BUT THERE COULD BE 
NEAR OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE 
RAINFALL BUT IN TERMS OF 
SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL LIKE LAST 
SUMMER IT DOES LOOK LESS LIKELY WE 
COULD SEE THAT TYPE OF WEATHER SO 
A TYPICAL BRITISH SUMMER AHEAD OF 
US BACK TO TONIGHT A MILD AND 
MISTY NIGHT AHEAD OF US IN FACT 
FOR SOME IT HAS BEEN THE WARMEST 
DAY OF THE YEAR SO FAR THE CLOUD 
TONIGHT WILL ACT LIKE A BLANKET AND 
PREVENT THE TEMPERATURES FROM 
FALLING TOO LOW ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
A MISTY NIGHT OVER CORNWALL AND 
WALES AND CLOUD AND RAIN COMING IN 
OVER SCOTLAND THE MURKYNESS ACROSS 
ENGLAND AND WALES SHOULD LIFT AND 
THE CLOUD THIN AND BREAK WITH SUNY 
SPELLS COMING THROUGH ON FRIDAY 
AND THE RAIN SHOULD CLEAR THE FAR 
SOUTH OF NORTHERN IRELAND BY THE 
MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON PUSHING 
ACROSS THE ISLE OF MAN AND WE'LL 
SEE LIGHT AND PATCHY RAIN TO THE 
NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND ACROSS 
THE PENNINES TOO FOR MUCH OF WALES 
IT WILL BE GREY AND OVERCAST WITH 
SOME BREAKS AND BRIGHTNESS FROM 
TIME TO TIME AND FEELING MILD THE 
NORTH CORNISH COAST WILL SEE MORE 
IN THE WAY OF CLOUD BUT BREAKS 
ALONG THE SOUTH COAST WILL MAKE FOR 
FIVE VERY PLEASANT SPRING DAY AND 
TEMPERATURES ALONG THE SOUTH EAST 
AND THE SOUTH COAST WILL BE VERY 
PLEASANT INDEED THE CLOUD OVER THE 
NORTH OF ENGLAND WILL MEAN IT WILL 
BE SLIGHTLY COLDER BUT A BRIGHT 
AND SUNNY DAY IN SCOTLAND BUT THEN 
A COLD NORTH PLUNGE DESCENDS 
ACROSS THE DONE BRINGING COLD 
ARCTIC AIR AND IT WILL FEEL VERY 
UNPLEASANT ON SATURDAY WITH SNOW 
OVER SCOTLAND IT WILL FEEL RAW IN 
THE NORTH BUT MILDER IN THE SOUTH 
BUT THEN ON SUNDAY WE COULD SEE 
SLEET AND SNOW SHOWERS ALMOST ANY 
WHERE WHERE NOW WE JOIN THE NEWS TEAMS WHERE 
YOU ARE
