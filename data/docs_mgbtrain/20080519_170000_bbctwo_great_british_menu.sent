FOR THE RIGHT TO PROVE THAT MODERN BRITISH COOKING IS UP THERE WITH THE BEST IN THE WORLD 
HALF OF OUR CHEFS HAVE FALLEN IN THE FIGHT AND WE'RE NOW DOWN TO OUR FINAL MAGNIFICENT SEVEN 
THIS WEEK IT'S OUR NATIONAL FINALS AND TOGETHER WITH THE JUDGES YOU'RE GOING TO DECIDE 
WHICH OF OUR REGIONAL CHAMPIONS WILL HAVE THE HONOUR OF 
COOKING FOR THE WORLD'S FINEST CHEFS AT HESTON BLUMENTHAL'S BANQUET AT THE GHERKIN 
EVERY DAY YOU'LL BE HELPING TO SELECT THE WINNING DISH FOR EACH COURSE BY VOTING AFTER EVERY SHOW 
TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE CHOOSING THE STARTER 
THE FIRST COURSE MUST BE OUTSTANDING AS IT'LL SET THE STANDARD FOR THE 
ENTIRE MEAL AND HESTON IS EXPECTING THE ULTIMATE DINING EXPERIENCE 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHOW THE REST OF THE WORLD HOW GOOD OUR COOKING IS BECAUSE IT'S THAT GOOD 
ALSO I HAPPEN TO BE PROUD TO BE BRITISH 
IT'S DAY ONE OF THE FINALS AND THE SEVEN VICTORIOUS CHEFS 
FROM THE REGIONAL HEATS ARE DESCENDING ON THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN TO DO BATTLE 
BIRMINGHAM'S GLYN PURNELL AND JASON ATHERTON FROM LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST ARRIVE EARLY 
ONLY TO FIND THAT NORTHERNER NIGEL HAWORTH AND STEPHEN TERRY FROM WALES HAVE BEATEN THEM TO IT 
HEY GUYS HOW ARE YOU 
SOME OF OUR CONTESTANTS ARE MEETING FOR THE FIRST TIME WHILE OTHERS ARE OLD COMRADES IN ARMS 
LOOKING WELL FIT 
NEXT TO ARRIVE ARE CHRIS HORRIDGE FROM THE SOUTH WEST AND SCOTLAND'S CHAMPION TOM KITCHIN 
HOW ARE YOU DOING HI JASON HOW'S THINGS 
CHRIS NICE TO MEET YOU 
MORNING GENTS 
LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS DANNY MILLAR WHO WILL BE FIGHTING NORTHERN IRELAND'S CORNER 
HOW'S IT GOING ALL RIGHT NICE TO MEET YOU 
THEY MAY BE SMILING NOW BUT THEY'RE ALL HERE IN DEADLY EARNEST 
EVERY ONE OF THEM IS A TOP CHEF AND DETERMINED TO WIN A PLACE AT THE BANQUET 
BUT AT LEAST THREE OF THEM WON'T MAKE IT 
WE'RE AT THE SHARP END OF IT NOW 
THIS IS WHERE IF YOU MESS UP IT'S GAME OVER REALLY 
EVERYONE'S GONNA BE SO FOCUSED NOW 
I DON'T DO ANYTHING FOR A SILVER MEDAL OR A BRONZE MEDAL 
I ALWAYS GO FOR THE GOLD THERE'S NO POINT COMPETING AT THIS LEVEL IF YOU DON'T FEEL YOU CAN GO ALL THE WAY 
THE FIRST HURDLE THEY HAVE TO SURMOUNT IS OUR PANEL OF JUDGES 
OLIVER PEYTON PRUE LEITH AND MATTHEW FORT 
IT'S THEIR JOB TO SCRUTINISE THE STARTERS AND AWARD THEM MARKS OUT OF TEN 
BUT TODAY'S WINNER WILL BE DECIDED BY COMBINING THE JUDGES' SCORES WITH YOUR VOTES 
THE JUDGES' MARKS WILL COUNT FOR FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TOTAL AND THE PUBLIC VOTE WILL MAKE UP THE OTHER HALF 
WE'LL EXPLAIN HOW TO VOTE LATER ON AND THE ALL IMPORTANT RESULTS WILL BE REVEALED ON FRIDAY 
BUT HOW IMPORTANT IS THE STARTER COURSE TO HESTON 
IT IS THE CURTAIN RAISER 
IT'S THE DISH THAT'S GOING TO SET THE TONE FOR THE REST OF THE MEAL 
IT'S THE DISH THAT IS HOPEFULLY GONNA GET THE JUDGES RUBBING THEIR HANDS WITH EXCITEMENT 
THE SEVEN CHEFS HAVE A TOUGH DAY AHEAD OF THEM 
BUT BEFORE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO START COOKING THEY'RE SUMMONED BY THE JUDGES FOR A PEP TALK 
WELCOME TO THE JUDGES' CHAMBER THIS IS WHERE IT STARTS GETTING SERIOUS 
IN ALL THE COMPETITIONS WE'VE HAD THIS HAS BEEN BY FAR THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF FOOD 
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE EXERCISED THE OPTION TO CHANGE 
ONE OF YOUR DISHES AND MAYBE TINKERED WITH ONE OF THE OTHER ONES 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING FOR US TO SEE 
I HAVE TO SAY THAT NOTHING YOU'VE DONE SO FAR COUNTS NOW 
IT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT MATTERS NOT WHAT YOU DID LAST TIME 
YOU HAVE THE TALENT WE HAVE THE APPETITE SO VERY GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL 
THANK YOU SEE YOU LATER 
WELL THE JUDGES WILL GET THEIR FIRST TASTE OF THE 
DELIGHTS ON OFFER VERY SOON BUT IN THE KITCHEN DOUBTS ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO SURFACE 
I'M THINKING I'D LIKE TO CHANGE MY DISHES NOW I'M HERE 
IT'S THAT SLIGHT SENSE OF INSECURITY CREEPING IN 
AND THEY'RE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT THE BANQUET TOO 
IF THEY WIN THROUGH THEY'LL HAVE TO PROVE THEMSELVES TO THE BEST CHEFS IN THE WORLD 
IT IS A LOT TO LIVE UP TO THE LAST THING WE WANT IS THEM COMING OVER TRAVELLING ALL THE 
WAY AROUND THE WORLD AND SAYING IT WASN'T THAT GOOD IT'S GOT TO BE GOOD YEAH 
IT'S BEEN DECIDED THAT THE SCOTTISH REGIONAL WINNER TOM KITCHIN AND JASON ATHERTON REPRESENTING 
LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST WILL COOK THEIR STARTERS FIRST 
MICHELIN STARRED TOM KITCHIN IS A FEISTY YOUNG CHEF WHO WORKS WITH 
THE FRESHEST SEASONAL PRODUCE AND BOLD INGREDIENTS 
IN THE REGIONAL HEATS TOM COOKED A BREAKFAST PLATTER 
OF WILD BOAR SAUSAGE TOPPED WITH A CRISPY PIG'S EAR AND A QUAIL'S EGG 
HE COMPLETED THE DISH WITH GRILLED TOMATO STUFFED MUSHROOM 
HARICOT BEANS AND PANCETTA 
IT'S GOT AM AMOUNT OF TONGUE IN CHEEK A BIT OF HUMOUR IN THERE IT'S A VERY TASTY DISH 
IT LOOKS GOOD I THINK THAT COULD BE MY TRUMP CARD 
JASON ATHERTON IS ONE OF GORDON RAMSAY'S PROTEGES 
HE'S WON HIS OWN MICHELIN STAR WITH STYLISH BRITISH TAPAS FOOD BUILT AROUND SUPERB FLAVOURS AND TEXTURES 
JASON SET OUT HIS STALL IN THE HEATS 
WITH AN ORIGINAL TAKE ON A SANDWICH PLATE 
A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY B. L. T. IN A GLASS AND A CROQUE MONSIEUR WITH TRUFFLES 
WHICH THE JUDGES FOUND BOTH SMART AND INNOVATIVE 
IT'S A MODERN TAKE ON SOMETHING WE EAT A LOT OF IN THIS COUNTRY SANDWICHES SO WE'LL SEE 
BUT BEFORE THE CHEFS FIRE UP THE STOVES 
THE JUDGES CALL JASON AND TOM INTO THE CHAMBER AGAIN TO DISCUSS THEIR STARTERS 
HAVE EITHER OF YOU CHANGED EITHER DISH MINE'S STAYING THE SAME I'M STICKING WITH THE SAME DISH 
WHEN I CREATED THE MENU I THOUGHT THAT WASN'T GOING TO BE AS STRONG 
COS I DIDN'T KNOW IF PEOPLE WOULD GET IT 
HANG ON YOU'RE DEALING WITH THREE OF THE FINEST CRITICAL MINDS IN THE COUNTRY THAT IS 
I HAVEN'T BEEN SO INSULTED IN YEARS MY ONLY CONCERN 
WITH YOURS WOULD BE THAT WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE BIG 
THE TROUBLE THERE IS THE COMPONENTS ARE SO SMALL ANYWAY 
TO HAVE THE COMPONENTS OF THE BREAKFAST CUTTING THEM DOWN I DON'T KNOW QUITE HOW 
I HAD NO TROUBLE IN EATING IT ALL 
IT WAS A DELICIOUS DISH A REALLY GREAT DISH 
SO THIS IS IT 
THE FINALS OF GREAT BRITISH MENU ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN 
WELL TOM HERE WE ARE 
YEAH LOOKING FORWARD TO IT I'M VERY INTRIGUED BY THIS B. L. T. VERY INTRIGUED 
THE FIRST DISH TO GO TO THE JUDGES WILL BE TOM'S WILD BOAR BREAKFAST 
IT'S A FEAST OF A FRY UP WHICH COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR ANOTHER 
OF OUR MAGNIFICENT SEVEN CHRIS HORRIDGE WHO INSISTS THAT FOOD SHOULD BE BOTH TASTY AND HEALTHY 
BUT HE IS CURIOUS ABOUT THIS 
HAVE YOU GOT DUXELLE IN YOUR MUSHROOMS 
A LITTLE DUXELLE SCOTTISH CHEDDAR ON TOP 
A LITTLE FRIED TOMATO I MADE HERB BREAD CRUMBS YEAH 
IT'S EARLY DAYS AND CHRIS DIDN'T CRITICISE IT AT ALL BUT THEN HE HADN'T SEEN THE 
REST OF IT INCLUDING TOM'S TAKE ON HOME MADE BAKED BEANS AND OF COURSE THE FRIED BOAR SAUSAGE 
JASON'S DISH IS HIGH FAT TOO 
CHRIS WILL HAVE A FIT IF HE SEES ME PUTTING ALL THIS IN OIL BUTTER 
FATTY BACON 
SURELY IT'S ABOUT PLEASURE FOOD 
THAT'S RIGHT I STILL ALLOW MYSELF TO EAT THE NICER THINGS IN LIFE 
I STILL LIKE A BACON SANDWICH ON A SUNDAY MORNING OF COURSE 
BUT THIS IS A STARTER AND AS THE JUDGES SAID IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO SUBSTANTIAL 
DO THINK THAT'S A LOT OF MEAT FOR A STARTER I'VE CUT IT DOWN I CAN'T GO ANY LESS THAN THIS ANYWAY 
AH SO TOM DID LISTEN TO THE JUDGES 
AS HE SHOULD IF HE WANTS TO GET TO THE GHERKIN 
ON GOES THE BOAR'S HEAD SAUSAGE AND THE WINNER OF THE CENTRAL HEAT GLYN PURNELL IS FASCINATED 
IT'S GOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF A BREAKFAST BUT WITH A LOT MORE SOPHISTICATION 
IT LOOKS REALLY NICE 
JASON ALSO SEEMS IMPRESSED 
TOM'S SETTING A VERY HIGH STANDARD 
WOW LOOK AT THAT BEAUTIFUL 
OH WELL 
APART FROM MY STARTER I HOPE IT WINS YOU'RE A GOOD LAD 
THIS COURSE COULD BE TOM'S BEST CHANCE OF GETTING TO THE BANQUET 
HE'S SCALED THE DISH DOWN AS THE JUDGES SUGGESTED BUT WILL THEY STILL LIKE IT 
IT'S SHRUNK 
THERE'S A PICTURE OF A MAN WHO'S JUST BEEN SHOVED IN THE DOOR OF WEIGHT WATCHERS 
I THINK IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
CRUNCHY PIG'S EAR CRUNCHY PIG'S EAR 
IT'S THE PORKY SCRATCHINGS OF PARADISE 
LAST TIME THE PIG'S EAR WAS THE ONE THING THAT WASN'T PERFECT 
IT WAS A BIT TOUGH AND BENDY 
THIS IS BEAUTIFULLY CRUNCHY 
IF THAT EVER ENTERED A COMPETITION FOR THE FINEST BRITISH BREAKFAST 
NO ONE ELSE SHOULD EVEN BOTHER TURNING UP M. M. M. 
I WOULD LOVE THAT FOR A FIRST COURSE 
THIS IS A VERY SMART POST MODERN HUMOROUS TAKE ON THE GREAT BRITISH BREAKFAST 
I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK A CHEF WHO HAS LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF 
THE GREAT BRITISH GREASY SPOON IS GOING TO UNDERSTAND THE HUMOUR OF IT 
HESTON MIGHT BE THE ONLY PERSON APART FROM US WHO ACTUALLY GETS THE JOKE 
LET'S FORGET ABOUT IT BEING A JOKE 
LET'S JUST JUDGE IT ON WHETHER THIS IS A DELICIOUS DISH AND TELL ME THAT IT'S NOT 
THIS IS NOT A SUMMER DISH 
THIS IS A DISH ONE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEFORE ONE GOES OUT 
CABER TOSSING IN THE MORNING 
WELL I THINK YOU'VE GOT ME THERE BECAUSE I HAVE TO CONFESS 
I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE MOST SUMMERY DISH WE'VE HAD 
BUT IT'S PRETTY DAMN NICE 
SO NOT BAD 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE JUDGES WHO ARE SCRUTINISING THE FOOD TODAY 
TOM CAN EXPECT SEARCHING CRITICISM FROM HIS RIVALS TOO 
I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY PUT THAT THERE 
COS THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GONE INTO THAT I LIKE TO SEE THAT 
I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE MAYBE CORNELLED THAT ON TOP 
WELL STEPHEN MAY FAULT THE PRESENTATION BUT IT'S TIME THEY GOT STUCK IN 
THAT TOMATO CHUTNEY IS DELICIOUS 
IT'S NICE ACTUALLY YEAH I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT GOT A NICE TOUCH OF A SENSE OF HUMOUR 
YEAH WHICH IS QUITE NICE 
IT MAY BE WITTY BUT DOES IT TICK ALL THE BOXES 
D'YOU THINK IT'S FINE DINING AS SUCH 
NO I DON'T THINK SO NO I DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT DISH FOR THE BANQUET 
THE REASON WHY WE HAVE FULL ENGLISH BREAKFAST IS IT SETS US UP FOR THE 
DAY THERE'S ANOTHER THREE COURSES AFTER THIS 
SO THE JUDGES HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ON WHAT THEY PICK AS THE NEXT THREE DISHES 
BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S GONNA BE 
WELL IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT HEALTHY EATING ADVOCATE CHRIS HAS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS FRY UP 
BUT BACK IN THE KITCHEN TOM'S STILL CONFIDENT 
THIS IS THE FOOD THAT I ENJOY EATING THE PIG'S HEAD THE EARS IT'S INTERESTING 
IT'S USING THE WHOLE OF THE ANIMAL AND WE'LL SEE HOW IT DOES YOU KNOW 
AND WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT AS THE JUDGES ARE READY TO GIVE THEIR SCORES 
IT IS A DISH WHICH APPEALS PRIMARILY TO THE BRITISH SENSE OF HUMOUR 
AND I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT FRENCH OR SPANISH OR ITALIAN 
OR AMERICAN CHEFS ARE GONNA PICK UP ON THAT 
SO ON THAT BASIS I'M AFRAID I'M ONLY GONNA GIVE IT A SEVEN 
WHO SAYS THAT THE FRENCH AND THE AMERICANS WON'T GET THE JOKE 
OF COURSE THEY'LL GET THE JOKE THE ONLY THING THEY KNOW ABOUT BRITISH FOOD IS THAT THE BREAKFAST IS GREAT 
WE'LL INVITE THEM BACK FOR BREAKFAST NO SO THEY'LL KNOW ABOUT BREAKFAST SO I AM GIVING IT A NINE 
ANY BREAKFAST ANY DAY THAT'S THE ONE FOR ME 
BUT JUST NOT AT THE GHERKIN BUT STILL IT'S AN EIGHT 
BACK IN THE KITCHEN OUR SECOND CHEF JASON ATHERTON IS PULLING 
IN A CROWD AS HE MAKES HIS STARTER AND TOM'S TAKING A SUSPICIOUSLY KEEN INTEREST IN HIS TRUFFLES 
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THE TRIMMINGS I'LL GIVE THEM TO YOU AND YOU CAN PUT THEM ON YOUR LUNCH MENU 
TYPICAL SCOT TYPICAL SCOT EH 
THE TRUFFLES WILL BE PART 
OF JASON'S CROQUE MONSIEUR WHICH WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A B. L. T. 
TO MAKE THAT HE CHILLS SOME TOMATO CONSOMME JELLY AND QUICKLY WHIPS UP 
A BACON AND ONION CREAM AND LARDONS FOR THIS MODERN TAKE ON SANDWICHES 
JASON'S INNOVATIVE DISH HAS CAUGHT THE EYE OF HIS FORMER BOSS STEPHEN WHO EMPLOYED HIM OVER TEN YEARS AGO 
THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF CHEFS ARE DOING NOW IT'S A BIT TONGUE IN CHEEK 
BIT OF A PLAY ON WORDS BUT THAT'S MODERN BRITISH WHERE WE GOING I THINK SO 
WITH THE TOMATO JELLY NOW SET JUST JASON CAN BUILD HIS B. L. T. 
THE NEXT LAYER IS A LIBERAL DOLLOP OF BACON AND ONION PUREE 
THE LETTUCE VELOUTE WILL BE SERVED IN SEPARATE GLASSES 
TOM CAN'T HELP BUT ADMIRE JASON'S HANDIWORK 
I KNOW TASTE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN COOKING 
BUT IF YOU'RE EATING WITH YOUR EYES THERE I THINK YOU COULD BE ON TO A WINNER 
DO YOU WANT TO POP THESE ON FOR ME TOM OF COURSE 
SO BASICALLY JUST 
LIKE THAT 
WELL THEY MAY BE RIVALS BUT IT'S GOOD TO SEE A BIT OF CAMARADERIE NOW AND THEN 
O. K. AWAY YOU GO THANK YOU 
WELL DONE MR. ATHERTON I THINK THAT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
TOM IS OBVIOUSLY A FAN OF JASON'S MODERN SANDWICH PLATE 
BUT IT'S THE JUDGES WHOSE OPINIONS COUNT NOW 
VERY HAPPY THE WAY IT WENT OUT IT LOOKED GREAT TASTED HOW I WANTED IT TO TASTE 
I'M HAPPY THEY SHOULD BE HAPPY 
GOD THIS COMPETITION IS 
HOTTING UP IS VERY COMPETITIVE 
I'M SITTING HERE WATCHING THAT DISH GOING DOWN AND THINKING YOU KNOW 
WOW THEY'RE TRYING VERY HARD AREN'T THEY THIS IS A VERY COOL DISH ISN'T IT 
I MEAN REALLY COOL THEY'RE SORT OF COOKING LIKE A MATHEMATICAL THEOREM 
EVERYTHING'S BEEN WORKED OUT SO PRECISELY AND 
THAT RAISES A QUESTION MARK IN MY MIND 
WHERE'S THE HEART WHERE'S THE HEART 
I THINK IT'S THERE BECAUSE IF THIS IS ANYTHING LIKE LAST TIME IT TASTES ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS 
JASON IS ONE HELL OF A COOK AND IT'S A JOKE AND I LOVE A JOKE 
SHOULD BE GOOD 
AND IT IS 
MY ONLY CONCERN ABOUT THIS DISH IS ITS BRITISHNESS 
I DON'T FEEL G. B. RUNNING ANYWHERE IN ITS VEINS IS MY 
IN FACT IT'S ALMOST DELIBERATELY NOT G. B. BECAUSE THAT'S FRENCH AND THAT'S AN AMERICAN IMPORT 
BUT THIS IS A TRULY GASTRONOMIC EXPERIENCE 
I MEAN THIS IS A BRILLIANT EXERCISE IN SKILL 
I MEAN IT'S REALLY AN EXQUISITE BEAUTIFUL 
WONDERFULLY BALANCED PIECE OF COOKING 
COME ON DANNY DON'T BE SHY 
THE GANNETS ARE GATHERING FOR THEIR SHARE OF THE FEAST 
I COULD SEE THAT HAPPENING I MEAN THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS CUTTING EDGE 
YEAH YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS WHAT JASON'S ALL ABOUT 
IT'S REFRESHING I TASTED THE LETTUCE EARLIER SEPARATELY 
IT'S QUITE STRONG BUT IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BE EATEN ON ITS OWN NO 
WHEN IT'S EATEN ALTOGETHER IT'S PERFECT 
I THINK IT IS A NICE WAY TO START A MEAL 
I SENSE A BUT COMING 
THIS ACTUALLY STANDS ON ITS OWN I THINK AS CUTTING EDGE 
VERY NICE VERY INTERESTING NICE FLAVOURS IN THE JELLY AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
THIS AREA HERE IS THIS IS FRANCE THIS IS BELGIUM 
SO THAT'S ANOTHER DISH ON CHRIS'S HIT LIST 
YOU CAN'T DENY IT'S A CRACKING DISH 
IT'S A GOOD INTRO 
EXACTLY WHETS YOUR APPETITE DOESN'T IT 
THAT GETS THE CREATIVE JUICES FLOWING 
IT'S LIKE WHAT'S NEXT 
SO GENERALLY POSITIVE REACTIONS BUT SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT JASON'S B. L. T. AND CROQUE MONSIEUR 
BUT DOES HE STILL STAND BY IT 
I THINK IT'S A WISE CHOICE YEAH PURELY ON THE BACK OF ITS CREATIVITY ITS INVENTIVENESS 
SO HOW WILL THE JUDGES SCORE THIS MODERN TAKE ON SANDWICHES 
IT WAS JASON ON A PLATE IT WAS MICHELIN STAR COOKING 
VERY PRECISE VERY WITTY 
IT WAS A REAL PLEASURE TO EAT BUT I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS BRITISH ENOUGH SO I GAVE IT AN EIGHT 
I MEAN THAT WAS A SENSATIONAL DISH AT EVERY LEVEL IN TERMS OF FLAVOUR IN TERMS OF TEXTURE 
IN TERMS OF VISUAL STYLE BUT IN THE END I JUST FELT 
WHERE'S THE HEART IN THIS 
THE CALCULATION GOT IN THE WAY OF TO ME THE FINAL OUNCE OF PLEASURE WHICH I EXPECTED TO EXTRACT FROM IT 
SO I'M GOING TO GIVE IT AN EIGHT 
I DIDN'T FEEL GREAT BRITAIN RUNNING THROUGH ITS VEINS WAS MY ONLY PROBLEM 
HOWEVER I STILL GIVE IT AN EIGHT 
SO THAT'S TWO DOWN BUT THERE ARE FIVE OTHER CHEFS TO GO AND ANY ONE OF THEM CAN BE THE WINNER 
THE DECISION WILL BE DOWN TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO VOTE AT THE END OF THE SHOW 
YOUR VOTE WILL BE ADDED TO THE JUDGES' CHOICES 
TO DETERMINE WHOSE STARTER WILL BE SERVED AT THE GHERKIN 
AND AS ALL THE CHEFS WILL BE UP FOR THE PUBLIC VOTE EVERY DAY THEY CAN WIN MORE THAN ONE COURSE 
SO WHILE SOME OF THE CHEFS CAN RELAX OTHERS MUST FOCUS ON PREPARATION 
AND THERE'S A DEFINITE SENSE OF COMPETITION IN THE AIR NOW 
A LOT OF GOOD PEDIGREE CHEFS OUT THERE KNOW THEIR ONIONS 
SO I NEED TO PUT MY HEAD DOWN AND PRODUCE THE GOODS 
CONVERSATION SOON TURNS TOWARD THE GHERKIN 
NICE FOR FOUR DIFFERENT CHEFS TO GO IT WOULD I THINK 
RATHER THAN SOMEBODY GOING WITH TWO DISHES AND THEN TWO OTHER 
I THINK AFTER MEETING EVERYBODY AS WELL IT'D BE GREAT IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY GET THERE 
TO COMMIS FOR WHOEVER WOULD BE GREAT JUST TO BE THERE ON THE NIGHT 
IT WOULD BE FUNNY 
IT'S TIME FOR TWO MORE CHEFS TO FACE THE JUDGES AND THEY'RE BOTH VERY EXPERIENCED 
THE REGIONAL WINNER FOR WALES STEPHEN TERRY LIVES IN ABERGAVENNY 
HE'S WON MICHELIN STARS IN THE PAST BUT NOW PREFERS TO COOK NO NONSENSE FOOD AND CHAMPIONS SEASONAL PRODUCE 
IN THE HEATS 
HE MADE ASPARAGUS WITH GOAT'S CHEESE DRESSING AND WELSH HAM 
SO IT'S A REAL CONTRAST WITH THE OTHER DISHES WE'VE SEEN TODAY 
MY STARTER'S VERY IT'S QUITE CLASSICAL IT'S INTERESTING 
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S DIFFERENT ENOUGH TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I'M NOT PINNING MY HOPES ON MY STARTER 
GOING HEAD TO HEAD WITH STEPHEN 
IS THE NORTH'S REGIONAL CHAMP NIGEL HAWORTH 
A MICHELIN STAR HOLDER FOR TWELVE YEARS NOW NIGEL BELIEVES IN MINIMUM INGREDIENTS AND MAXIMUM FLAVOUR 
IN THE HEATS THE JUDGES THOUGHT HIS LANCASHIRE HOT POT SALAD WITH LAMB 
RED CABBAGE AND SWEETBREADS WAS DAINTY AND DELICIOUS 
WILL THE PRESSURE OF THE FINALS MAKE IT HARDER 
I'M VERY EXCITED 
YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A FEW BUTTERFLIES WHICH I ALWAYS THINK IS GOOD 
OUR JUDGING PANEL WANT TO TALK TO NIGEL AND STEPHEN BEFORE THEY START COOKING THEIR DISHES 
GOOD TO SEE YOU HELLO HAVE YOU CHANGED ANYTHING ABOUT THEM AT ALL 
NOTHING YOU HAVEN'T 
YOU ALL SO LOVED IT WE DID LOVE IT 
WE DID LIKE IT VERY MUCH INDEED WE LOVED BOTH OF THEM 
WHEN I ASKED YOU RECOMMENDED LAST TIME AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY TO CHANGE MY STARTER 
WHY DID YOU THINK WE WANTED YOU 
I DIDN'T KNOW FULLY IF IT WAS WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR 
IN TERMS OF THE BRIEF AND IT WAS MODERN ENOUGH OR TECHNICAL ENOUGH 
WHAT I FEEL FUNNILY ENOUGH ABOUT BOTH DISHES IS THAT THEY 
WERE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS AND THEY BOTH DID WHAT I WANTED THEM TO DO 
BUT HAVING SEEN EVERYBODY ELSE'S YOU GET BLOWN AWAY BY AMAZING PRESENTATION 
OR FANTASTIC INNOVATION OR A NEW WITTY TWIST ON SOMETHING 
WAS PRUE SUGGESTING THAT OUR VETERAN CHEFS SHOULD JAZZ THEIR DISHES UP A BIT I WONDER 
HERE WE ARE STEVE 
ONCE AGAIN HAH 
STEPHEN'S ASPARAGUS DISHES WILL BE THE FIRST TO GO FOR JUDGING 
AND AS HE STARTS PREPARING HIS VEGETABLES HE REALISES THAT HE AND NIGEL HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON 
WE ARE ACTUALLY THE TWO OLDEST COMPETITORS IN THE COMPETITION 
WE ARE IT DOES MAKE YOU FEEL OLD I LOOK AT PEOPLE LIKE JASON AND I THINK OF THEM AS YOUNG KIDDIES 
HE USED TO WORK FOR ME HE'S IN HIS MID THIRTIES NOW AND IT'S LIKE BLIMEY 
I KNOW WHAT HE MEANS BUT RIGHT NOW HE'S GOT OTHER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT 
LIKE COOKING SOMETHING THAT ONE OF OUR JUDGES HAS A PET HATE ABOUT 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE GOAT'S CHEESE IT'S LIKE A DIP WITH ASPARAGUS 
IT WORKS QUITE WELL 
WHEN I FIRST DID IT EVERYONE SAID MATTHEW HATES GOAT'S CHEESE 
GREAT THANKS FOR TELLING ME NOW IT'S A BIT LATE NOW TO CHANGE IT 
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT MATTHEW THERE'S THREE OF THEM 
THAT'S WHAT I SAID IF HE DOESN'T LIKE IT HE CAN LEAVE IT 
MIND YOU HE CAN EAT ANYTHING AS FAR AS I KNOW AYE 
WELL MATTHEW DOES LIKE HIS FOOD IT'S TRUE 
BUT ALL THREE JUDGES HAVE DISCERNING PALATES AND THEY'RE QUITE CAPABLE OF 
REWARDING SUBSTANCE OVER STYLE IF A DISH IS REALLY GOOD 
WHERE DOES THIS ONE SIT STEVE AS FAR AS YOUR FOUR DISHES GO IS THIS ONE OF YOUR FAVOURITES 
I LIKE IT AND I THINK IT WORKS BUT I THINK IN COMPARISON TO SOME OF THE STARTERS THAT ARE GOING OFF TODAY 
I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S GOING TO BE TOP OF THE LIST 
SO WHICH ONES ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT MINE OF COURSE 
JASON'S B. L. T. 
IT'S INTRIGUING YOU KNOW YEAH 
INTRIGUING YES BUT STEPHEN HAS A VERY DIFFERENT STYLE OF COOKING 
IT'S TOO LATE TO CHANGE HIS STARTER NOW 
THE ESSENCE OF THIS DISH IS THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH 
IT'S THE EATING OF IT AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING AT IT 
SOME OF THESE DISHES ARE GOING TO BE GLASS DISHES AND JELLIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
I LOVE ALL THAT BUT I JUST DIDN'T CHOSE TO DO IT IN THIS INSTANCE 
I MIGHT LOSE OUT IN THAT DEPARTMENT 
BUT DOES HIS OLD EMPLOYEE JASON AGREE 
I'VE KNOWN STEPHEN FOR YEARS I DON'T EXPECT LOTS OF FRILLY GARNISHES 
HE LEAVES THAT TO THE LONDON BOYS 
STEPHEN'S DISH IS ALMOST READY 
SOME OF THE ASPARAGUS IS GRIDDLED BUT HE LIKES TO MAKE THINGS UP AS HE GOES ALONG 
NOT QUITE SURE THAT'S GOING TO COOK ON THERE JUST BE CAREFUL 
THE SALAD GETS A QUICK SPIN AND A TOUCH OF DRESSING 
THEN HE DEEP FRIES HIS CRUMBED ASPARAGUS AND HE'S READY TO PLATE UP 
THERE GOES THE GOAT'S CHEESE 
AND FINALLY SOME CRISPY CARMARTHEN HAM 
WE'RE THERE SIMPLE TASTY 
BEST OF LUCK 
SO WAS STEPHEN RIGHT TO STICK WITH HIS DISH 
MATTHEW HAS BEEN KNOWN TO APPLAUD GOAT'S CHEESE IF IT'S USED IN A CREATIVE WAY 
HE'S CHANGED IT HE'S PUT THE GOAT'S CHEESE IN A POT 
IT DOES LOOK BETTER FOR THAT 
IT LOOKS NEATER TIDIER 
I THINK IT WAS FAR MORE IMPACTFUL THE FIRST TIME ROUND 
WE HADN'T SEEN SO MANY OTHER AMAZING THINGS BUT I STILL THINK IT'S LOVELY AND IT SMELLS GOOD 
I'M NOW NOT CONVINCED YOU'VE GONE OFF GOAT'S CHEESE AGAIN 
I JOLLY WELL HAVE IT HAS BOTH THE TEXTURE AND THE FLAVOUR OF POLYFILLA AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED 
ISN'T THAT ODD THAT YOU THOUGHT SO DIFFERENTLY LAST TIME ROUND 
HE SERVED IT DIFFERENTLY HE DIDN'T HAVE IT QUITE EN MASSE 
IT WAS DRIBBLED OVER IN MUCH SMALLER QUANTITIES 
OH RIGHT THERE ARE MORE EITHER REFINED DISHES 
OR MORE ELABORATE DISHES AVAILABLE TO US TO CHOSE FROM 
IF I'M SITTING AT THE TOP OF THE GHERKIN 
WITH SOME OF THE FINEST CHEFS IN THE WORLD PEERING OVER MY SHOULDER 
JUDGING ME BY JUDGING THE FOOD THAT I'VE JUDGED THEN I WOULD SAY THIS AIN'T GONNA MAKE IT 
IT'S MORE MODERN AND MORE CUTTING EDGE 
I WOULD SAY THE COMPETITION IS GETTING FIERCER AND I THINK THIS IS A VERY NICE DISH A VERY GOOD DISH 
EXCEPT FOR THE GOAT'S CHEESE I AM NOT GOING TO LOVE THIS GOAT'S CHEESE 
I THOUGHT WE HAVE SUCH A TRIUMPH THAT YOU FINALLY LIKED GOAT'S CHEESE 
NOT THIS TIME ROUND BUT WHAT WILL THE OTHER CHEFS MAKE OF IT 
IN MY OPINION I DON'T THINK IT IS CUTTING EDGE 
IT'S NOT A DISH YOU'D PUT ON A PLATTER AND SAY THIS IS WHERE MODERN BRITISH FOOD IS GOING 
THE FOOD HE'S COOKING HERE IS HIGHLY REGIONAL TO WALES ALL THE HAM AND THE WELSH ASPARAGUS 
HOW MODERN CAN YOU MAKE THAT DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
JASON'S LOYALLY STICKING UP FOR HIS OLD BOSS BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR STEPHEN 
HE'S NOT ON THE JUDGING PANEL AND HE'S IN A MINORITY 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONSENSUS THAT WHILE THIS DISH IS GOOD IT ISN'T CUTTING EDGE BRITISH COOKING 
IN COMPARISON TO SOME OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TO SEE TODAY IT'S NOT A TECHNICAL DISH 
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS IT'S QUALITY GOAT'S CHEESE ASPARAGUS 
YOU CAN'T DO TOO MUCH TO IT I DON'T FEEL 
IF I'D HAD THIS IN STEVEN'S PUB I'D BE VERY HAPPY WITH IT AS A FIRST COURSE 
BUT AS A DISH FOR THE GHERKIN IT ISN'T EVEN A STARTER 
AND IT DID REMIND ME OF WHY I HATE GOAT'S CHEESE 
I'D PREFER TO PULL MY TEETH OUT THAN HAVE THAT AGAIN 
ANYWAY ON THE BASIS OF THAT I'M GOING TO GIVE IT FIVE 
I DID THINK IT WAS MORE OF AN INFORMAL DISH THAN WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
SO I GAVE IT A SIX 
I JUST THINK IT DIDN'T GO THE EXTRA YARD AND I'M GOING TO GIVE IT A SIX ON THAT BASIS 
BUT NOW IT'S TIME FOR NIGEL HOWARD'S STARTER 
TWEAKING I'VE GOT BUTTERFLIES AND I LOOK CALM 
I DON'T KNOW HOW I DO IT I TELL YOU 
THERE SPEAKS A TRUE LANCASTRIAN 
AND HE'S MODERNISING A TRADITIONAL DISH IN THE FORM OF A HOTPOT SALAD 
NIGEL IS STEAMING HIS LAMB AND FRYING A MIX OF CARROTS AND ONIONS 
ONCE THAT'S ON THE GO HE SLICES THE CHIVES FOR THE SALAD 
AND STEVEN CAN'T RESIST COMING ROUND TO SEE WHAT HE'S UP AGAINST 
SPRING ONIONS IN WHAT'S THAT IN THERE 
IS THAT YOUR LAMB LOIN THAT'S THE LAMB LOIN WITH THE SMOKY ONIONS 
HOW LONG DO YOU STEAM THAT FOR NOW NINE MINUTES I'VE PUT IT ON EIGHT 
I'M JUST GOING TO CHECK SO IT'S ANOTHER MINUTE TO GO 
HE'S GOT EVERYTHING ON THE GO NOW BUT HE'S REHEARSED THIS DISH AND IT'S ALL UNDER CONTROL 
WITH MORE YEARS EXPERIENCE THAN ANY OTHER CHEF IN THE FINALS HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DOING 
IS YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE 
YEAH IT'S ONE OF THE NICEST DISHES WITHOUT DOUBT 
I'M HOPING THAT IT'S GOING TO HIT THE MARK 
SO HE'S QUIETLY CONFIDENT AND READY TO PLATE UP BANG ON SCHEDULE 
THE LAMB SITS NICELY ON A LITTLE RED CABBAGE AND HE TOPS HIS SWEETBREAD WITH DICED VEGETABLES 
ALL IT NEEDS NOW IS THE SALAD 
AND STEVEN JOKES THAT IT'S ALL TOO COMPLICATED FOR A BANQUET 
RECKON YOU COULD DO THAT FOR FIFTY PEOPLE YEAH 
A FEW FINAL TOUCHES AND HIS STARTER IS READY TO GO 
IT'S A VERY DECONSTRUCTED HOTPOT ISN'T IT YEAH 
IT IS HOTPOTSALAD 
BUT NO SOONER HAVE THE WAITERS LEFT THE KITCHEN THAN STEVEN SPOTS SOMETHING ON THE COUNTERTOP 
WHAT'S THAT THERE IS THAT ON THEN YEAH 
YOU DIDN'T PUT THEM ON NO WHAT WAS IT SUPPOSED TO BE ON THEN YEAH JUST ON THE SIDE 
YOU FORGOT OR YOU MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION NO I FORGOT 
SO WILL THE JUDGES NOTICE THAT THE CRISPS ARE MISSING 
HMM 
I NOTICED THERE'S NO POTATO ON THIS DISH SO HOW IT QUITE COVERS THE DESCRIPTION OF LANCASHIRE HOTPOT 
I MISSED A COMPONENT 
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT H. N. I. I. THROUGH THE DOOR HASN'T IT 
SO HAS HIS MISTAKE RUINED HIS CHANCES 
IT'S ALMOST SLIGHTLY INCONGRUOUS TO THINK OF SOMETHING DESCRIBED AS A LANCASHIRE HOTPOT SALAD 
SHOULD COME IN SO EXQUISITE A FORM THAT SWEETBREAD IS AS GOOD AS SWEETBREAD GETS IN TERMS OF TASTE 
SO DELICATE AND BEAUTIFUL IT'S ABSOLUTELY AN EXPLOSION OF FLAVOUR WHEN IT HITS YOUR MOUTH 
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD TASTING PIECE OF MEAT 
IT'S INTERESTING THAT LAMB BECAUSE IT'S QUITE TOUGH AND YET IT HAS NOT A LAMBY FLAVOUR AT ALL 
THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO FLAVOUR AT ALL 
I THINK THIS IS SO GOOD THAT YOU DON'T NEED THE LAMB BECAUSE I THINK THE REST OF THE PLATE IS DELICATE 
HE'S CALLED IT LANCASHIRE HOTPOT SWEETBREAD 
I WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY AND QUADRUPLED THE SIZE OF THE SWEETBREAD 
IF THIS WAS THE BEST LAMB IN THE U. K. 
I WOULD STILL LOVE TO SEE THIS AT THE GHERKIN BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A VERY PRETTY DISH VERY SUMMERY 
LAST TIME WE WERE REMARKING ON HOW BEAUTIFUL THE LAMB WAS 
IT WAS WONDERFUL LAMB LAST TIME THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH EXAMS 
ON THE DAY YOU'VE GOT TO GET IT RIGHT 
SOME MIXED REACTIONS FROM THE JUDGES THEN BUT WHAT WILL HIS RIVALS MAKE OF IT 
NO SAUCE WITH IT 
A WEE BIT OF RED CABBAGE IT WAS 
I REALLY LIKE THAT IT'S CLEVER IT'S WITTY 
IT'S UNUSUAL TO HAVE LAMB AS A STARTER BUT IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT'S SO LIGHT AND DELICATE 
SUCH A BRITISH INGREDIENT I THINK IT'D WORK WELL 
SHOW CHEFS AROUND THE WORLD WHAT WE CAN DO I THINK IT'S GOOD 
WE CAN'T CRITICISE WILL WE GET CHRIS IN 
WHERE IS CHRIS 
BUT WHATEVER HE'D SAY ABOUT IT NIGEL KNOWS HIS INCOMPLETE HOTPOT SALAD WILL BE JUDGED AS IT STANDS 
WHEN YOU START TO GO 
YOU'RE PUTTING ALL THE COMPONENTS ON 
I PERHAPS RUSHED IT A LITTLE BIT AND JUST MISSED THE CRISP BUT 
NIGEL IS A REALLY TALENTED CHEF AND IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY CONCEIVED 
BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED ALL THE INGREDIENTS WENT TOGETHER VERY WELL 
I HAD ONE REAL QUARREL WITH IT AND UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS WITH THE MAIN INGREDIENT WHICH WAS THE LAMB 
THE LAMB HAD NO FLAVOUR SO I'M GIVING IT A SIX 
I WOULD HAVE TASTED THE LAMB DITCHED THE LAMB AND MADE A SWEETBREAD DISH 
BECAUSE IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE WON IT THE SWEETBREADS WERE THAT GOOD 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY EXCUSE FOR THE LAMB IT WAS TERRIBLE I AGREE WITH YOU AND IT'S A SIX 
TO DECONSTRUCT A HOTPOT IN THAT WAY 
I WASN'T SURE IF IT WAS LANCASHIRE LIGHT OR LANCASHIRE TERRIBLY ELEGANT AND SOPHISTICATED 
BUT IN THE END HOWEVER YOU DRESS IT UP 
IT DID DEPEND UPON THE QUALITY OF THE LAMB TO SOME EXTENT AND I'M AFRAID LIKE YOU TWO 
I FOUND IT WITHOUT FLAVOUR AND WITHOUT FLAVOUR AND WITHOUT FAVOUR 
SO ON THAT BASIS I'M ALSO GOING TO GIVE IT A SIX 
OUR VETERAN CHEFS ARE DONE NOW AND NIGEL SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELAX 
HAPPY YEAH GOOD I FORGOT A COMPONENT BUT Y'KNOW 
YEAH STEVE REMEMBERED IT DIDN'T YOU 
I JUST WONDERED WHAT THEY WERE 
I SORT OF JUST CLOCKED IT THINKING AND THEN HE CAME ON HAVE YOU NOT PUT YOUR CRISPS ON 
SO THAT'S FOUR CHEFS WHO'VE COOKED THEIR STARTERS NOW 
BUT THAT STILL LEAVES THREE WHO ARE EQUALLY DETERMINED 
WE'LL SHOW YOU THE JUDGES' ORDER OF PREFERENCE AT THE END OF THE SHOW 
BUT THEN THE PHONE LINES WILL OPEN AND YOU CAN SAY WHO YOU WANT TO WIN 
THE PUBLIC VOTE CARRIES EQUAL WEIGHT WITH THE JUDGES IN DECIDING WHO TRIUMPHS IN THE STARTER COURSE 
CHRIS AND GLYN ARE RELAXING BEFORE THEY HAVE TO COOK THEIR STARTERS 
LOOK AT THIS CATCH THIS PIGEON FOR THE PERFECT FLYING START THAT'S IT 
IS IT A SIGN WITH CHRIS COOKING PIGEON NEXT I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT 
IT ACTUALLY SAYS THE FUTURE OF FOOD IS GLUTEN FREE DAIRY FREE SUGAR FREE 
IT'S IN BLACK AND WHITE 
ALSO IN BLACK AND WHITE IS STOP THE PIGEON VOTE FOR THE TRIFLE 
HE'S IRREPRESSIBLE THAT BOY 
BUT NOW IT'S TIME FOR OUR LAST THREE AND VERY DIFFERENT CHEFS GLYN CHRIS AND DANNY 
THE CHAMPION OF THE CENTRAL REGION GLYN PURNELL 
IS AN IMAGINATIVE CHEF WHOSE FOOD SHOWS FLAIR AND FLAVOUR 
FOR HIS STARTER HE COOKED A RABBIT TRIFLE AND PEA CUSTARD 
AND A SWEET TOFFEE RABBIT LOLLIPOP 
THE JUDGES THOUGHT IT WAS EXQUISITE AND DELICATELY PUT TOGETHER 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A TERRINE IN A GLASS REALLY 
IT'S A SAFE DISH BUT IT'S GOT THAT QUIRKINESS 
MY SENSE OF HUMOUR IN IT SO I THINK IT FITS RIGHT INTO THE CATEGORY 
THE NORTHERN IRISH WINNER DANNY MILLAR 
HAS BEEN COOKING FOR TWENTY YEARS AND SETTLED ON AN UNCOMPLICATED STYLE 
BASED ON FRESH LOCAL PRODUCE 
IN THE HEATS THE JUDGES THOUGHT HIS DISH OF SWEETBREADS WITH PEAS 
BROAD BEANS AND MOREL MUSHROOMS WAS COURAGEOUS BUT A LITTLE UNEXCITING 
IT'LL HAVE TO BE VERY BAD TO GET THIS ONE WRONG 
I WANT TO START OFF WELL KEEP IT NICE AND SIMPLE GO IN EASY 
OUR LAST CHEF SOUTH WEST CHAMPION CHRIS HORRIDGE 
IS ANOTHER MICHELIN STAR HOLDER 
HE BELIEVES THAT FOOD SHOULD LOOK GOOD TASTE GOOD AND DO YOU GOOD 
HE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT NUTRITION AND COMBINES HIS SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT INGREDIENTS 
WITH FIRST RATE COOKERY SKILLS TO CREATE EYE CATCHING DISHES 
IN THE HEATS CHRIS MADE CURED WILD PIGEON WITH BROCCOLI SPROUTS 
AND OMEGA RICH SEEDS FOR HIS STARTER 
AND THE JUDGES THOUGHT HIS DISH WAS BOTH ELEGANT AND FULL OF FLAVOUR 
I THINK IT'S MORE THAN JUST A FANCY LITTLE BIT OF FOOD ON A PLATE 
I'M TAKING MY FOOD IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AREA TO EVERYBODY ELSE 
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S THE ONLY COG IN THE FUTURE OF FOOD BUT IT'S CERTAINLY GONNA PLAY A PART 
LIKE THE FOUR CHEFS WHO'VE COOKED ALREADY DANNY CHRIS AND GLYN ARE CALLED INTO THE JUDGING CHAMBER 
TELL ME ABOUT THE RABBIT HAVE YOU DONE ANY CHANGES 
HAVE YOU KEPT THE LOLLIPOP I'VE KEPT THE LOLLIPOP YEAH 
YOU MIGHT EVEN GET TWO EACH THIS TIME TWO LOLLIPOPS MAY BE JUST ONE LOLLIPOP TOO MANY 
I WAS THINKING OF SERVING TWO SMALLER ONES RATHER THAN ONE BIG ONE 
DANNY YOU COOKED SWEETBREADS WITH MORELS HAVE YOU CHANGED THAT AT ALL 
YES THIS TIME LUCKILY ENOUGH IT'S A BIT FURTHER INTO THE SEASON AND I'VE GOT MY ROE VENISON SWEETBREADS 
THEY'RE JUST ABOUT RIPENING SO I HAVE ENOUGH FOR YOU TO SAMPLE 
VENISON SWEETBREADS I HAVE NEVER HAD THEY'RE A TREAT 
PARTICULARLY I FELT CHRIS'S PIGEON WITH THE SEEDS 
THAT WAS REALLY FASCINATING BECAUSE IT WAS VERY MODERN FELT SO HEALTHY AT THE END OF IT DIDN'T YOU PRU 
YES IT WAS HEALTHY BUT THAT WASN'T THE POINT ABOUT IT FOR ME IT TASTED FANTASTIC 
FORGIVE ME INTERRUPTING BUT WE HAVE STILL TO EAT THIS ALL OVER AGAIN 
SO THE COMPETITION IS STILL WIDE OPEN 
SO FAR TODAY THE JUDGES HAVE EATEN WILD BOAR A B. L. T. ASPARAGUS WITH GOAT'S CHEESE AND LAMB 
NOW THEY'LL BE GETTING RABBIT IN THE FORM OF A TRIFLE 
SERVED WITH LOLLIPOPS GLYN IS USING SEVERAL PARTS OF THE ANIMAL 
THE KIDNEYS LOIN AND A RACK OF RIBS DANNY'S INTRIGUED 
AND YOU'RE USING THE LOIN BONE AS PART OF YOUR STICK LIKE THE LOLLIPOP 
I'M GONNA USE COCKTAIL STICKS FOR THE LOLLIPOP 
AND I'M ALSO GONNA SERVE THE RACK THE LIVER AND KIDNEY AS A SALAD ON TOP OF IT WITH THE GINGERBREAD 
SO IT'S QUITE A SIMPLE DISH THEN 
GLYN HAS GIVEN HIMSELF A FIDDLY TASK 
THESE ARE PRETTY SMALL CUTS OF MEAT AND STEPHEN WONDERS WHAT PART THEY PLAY IN THE DISH 
HOW DOES THAT SIT IN YOUR GLASS IT SITS ON THE TOP OR ON THE SIDE 
THE LOLLIPOP GOES ON THE SIDE AND THE RACKS GO ALL IN THE TOP 
IT CAN BE A BIT OF A DISH THAT YOU DIVE IN AND ROLL YOUR FINGERS UP THEN FINISH WITH THE SPOON 
WHICH IS WHAT FOOD'S ALL ABOUT REALLY VERY MODERN THAT'S FOR SURE 
BEST OF LUCK YOU MEAN THAT DO YOU I DO MEAN THAT GOOD LAD I MEAN THAT WHOLEHEARTEDLY 
HE'S GOT HIS FINGERS CROSSED HERE 
GLYN'S STARTER HAS CAUSED QUITE A STIR 
AND IT GIVES STEPHEN EVEN MORE REASON TO THINK HE MISCALCULATED 
MY STARTER IN COMPARISON TO THAT IS JUST PEDESTRIAN REALLY 
THE QUALITY OF IT IS FANTASTIC BUT I THINK THAT'S JUST CUTTING EDGE 
AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT THE JUDGES ARE GONNA BE GRAVITATING TOWARDS 
GLYN'S READY TO PUT THE TRIFLE TOGETHER NOW 
THE RABBIT AND OLIVE JELLY IS TOPPED WITH A LAYER OF PEA CUSTARD 
HIS RIVALS ARE ALL WATCHING AND JASON WANTS TO KNOW HOW HE THOUGHT OF IT 
DO YOU TRY AND THINK OF SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT WITTY 
AND THEN DISMANTLE IT AND TRY TO BUILD IT UP INTO SOMETHING 
I THINK SO I'VE GOT A BIT OF A SENSE OF HUMOUR ANYWAY SO I LIKE TO 
MY MUM SAYS SO ANYWAY 
I TRY TO INJECT A LITTLE BIT OF A SENSE OF HUMOUR 
IN SOME OF MY COOKING 
THIS JUST MAKES ME SMILE A LITTLE BIT 
ALL HE HAS TO DO NOW IS DRIZZLE SOME BLACK OLIVE JUICE OVER THE TOP 
ADD THE LOLLY AND HE'S DONE 
GRAB THEM JUST BE CAREFUL THEY SLIDE A BIT 
THESE BOYS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS 
THERE WE GO RABBIT BLACK OLIVE PEA TRIFLE WITH RABBIT LOLLIPOPS 
BONNE CHANCE AS THEY SAY ACROSS THE WATER 
NOW THE JUDGES LOVED THIS DISH IN THE HEATS 
AND IT'S CLEARLY INTRIGUED GLYN'S FELLOW CHEFS 
SO IS HE FEELING CONFIDENT ABOUT IT 
I THINK THE JUDGES ARE GONNA LIKE THAT IT'S VERY CONTEMPORARY 
IT'S MODERN IT'S GOT AN EDGE 
AGAIN I GO ON ABOUT THIS SENSE OF HUMOUR 
I WANT PEOPLE TO ENJOY THE FOOD AND FEEL HAPPY EATING IT 
I THINK IT'S JUST SUCH A WITTY TRIFLE ISN'T IT 
I DON'T THINK IT TASTES AS GOOD AS THE LAST TIME 
IT'S SWEETER MM 
THE LOLLIPOP ALL I'M GETTING IS THE SWEET TASTE OF THE LOLLIPOP 
I'M GOING TO TRY AND GET THE JELLY AND THE RABBIT 
WITHOUT ANY PEAS ON IT LIKE THAT VERY LITTLE PEA 
SEE 
I WONDER IF HE'S ADDED SOME SUGAR THAT'S MUCH BETTER 
IF IT HAD BEEN THAT MUCH JELLY 
AND RABBIT AND THEN A TINY LAYER OF PEAS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER 
IN ITS FIRST INCARNATION IT WOULD'VE BEEN A GREAT DISH TO GO THROUGH TO THE GHERKIN 
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A RISKY DISH BECAUSE THIS SORT OF JOKE 
IF YOU LIKE IF IT DOESN'T COME OFF GASTRONOMICALLY 
IF IT DOESN'T COME OFF IN THE MOUTH A FLAVOUR THEN IT'S JUST A JOKE 
SO THE BALANCE BETWEEN FAILURE AND TERRIFIC SUCCESS ARE VERY NARROW 
SO IT DIDN'T REALLY COME OFF THIS TIME BUT WHAT WAS DIFFERENT 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SEVEN CRAFTSMEN HERE AND IT'S LIKE ANYTHING 
THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF PRESSURE CHRIS CAN COOK YOU CAN COOK 
THEN JASON COMES OVER THE PRESSURE'S THERE 
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THE JUDGES 
AND THE PRESSURE ISN'T OVER YET BECAUSE HIS FELLOW CHEFS 
ARE GETTING STUCK IN IN THE PRIVACY OF THE TASTING ROOM 
IT'S REALLY GOOD I REALLY LIKE IT 
IT'S THE KIND OF FOOD I'D COOK 
IT'S A TRENDY DISH 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I WOULD SERVE BUT I APPRECIATE IT 
SO DID THE JUDGES GET IT ALL WRONG 
I LOVE THE JELLY AND THE PEA 
I'M NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE SWEETNESS 
I THINK THE PEAS ARE SWEET ENOUGH YEAH 
BUT WILL THEY SAY ALL THAT TO HIS FACE 
IT WASN'T REALLY THAT BAD 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT 
THAT'S WHY I NEVER COME IN EARLIER BECAUSE 
THE FIGHTS WE'VE HAD 
WHAT YOU'VE ACHIEVED THERE IS I LIKE IT IT'S FANTASTIC 
I WANT TO TRY AND MAKE PEOPLE SMILE 
IF I MADE ALL THREE OF YOU SMILE I'VE DONE THE JOB 
BUT THE CHEFS AGREE WITH THE JUDGES THAT IT WAS A LITTLE TOO SWEET 
SO HOW DOES GLYN FEEL 
NOW THAT THE PLATES HAVE COME BACK FROM THE CHAMBER 
I WAS PRETTY PLEASED WITH IT 
THE GUYS TRIED IT THEY SEEMED PRETTY PLEASED WITH IT 
THE JUDGES I'M NOT SURE 
IT WAS SO SWEET THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TRIFLE 
IT COULD ALMOST HAVE HAD CUSTARD ON IT 
BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS 
IT IS STILL AN ORIGINAL AND QUITE WONDERFUL DISH 
BECAUSE IT WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO SUGARY 
I COULDN'T GIVE IT THE MARKS I WANTED 
BUT IT'S STILL A GREAT DISH AND I'M GOING TO GIVE IT A SEVEN 
THERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WHERE IT'S A GREAT IDEA 
AND IT COULD'VE BEEN AMAZING BUT ONE LITTLE THING MAKES IT GO WRONG 
FOR ME THIS WAS PROBABLY A NINE DISH WHICH IS NOW SIX 
IT REMINDED ME OF ONE OF THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS WHERE SOMEONE JOGS YOUR ELBOW 
AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE PRESSING THE BUTTON AND EVERYTHING GOES BLURRY 
SO ON THAT BASIS I'M AFRAID IT'S A SIX FROM ME 
BUT BACK IN THE KITCHEN DEMAND FOR GLYN'S DISH HAS OUTSTRIPPED SUPPLY 
GLYN WHERE'S MY TRIFLE THE LAD 
YOU PROMISED ME THE LAD SMASHED IT 
IS THAT IT ALL OF THEM GONE 
I WANT TO TASTE THAT AS WELL I DIDN'T GET A MOUTHFUL OF IT 
THAT'S IT NO TRIFLE 
I ALWAYS PREFERRED SAT ANYWAY 
SAT BAINS WAS THE CHEF GLYN DEFEATED IN THE HEATS 
THERE ARE ONLY TWO CONTESTANTS LEFT TO COOK NOW 
AND DANNY MILLAR IS HOPING HIS NOVEL COMBINATION 
OF SWEET BREADS 
AND MOREL FOAM WILL GET HIM TO THE GHERKIN 
HE'S GONE FOR A VERY UNUSUAL MAIN INGREDIENT 
AND CHEFS ARE ALWAYS INTERESTED IN SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
TWO WEE BAD BOYS THERE 
SEE THEY'RE NOT FULLY DEVELOPED YET 
THEY GROW UP NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN LAMBS BUT IT'S A YOUNG VENISON 
I GOT ENOUGH FOR US TO SAMPLE HOPEFULLY CHEF CAN GET A TASTE 
PLUS THE JUDGES 
ARE THERE SPICES ON THERE YES IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF MOREL POWDER 
THEY LOOK GREAT YEAH THEY ARE 
I'VE NEVER HAD THEM BEFORE 
THE VEAL AND VENISON SWEETBREADS ARE DIPPED INTO A WATER BATH FOR A FEW MINUTES 
AND WHILE DANNY WAITS FOR THEM TO COOK HE SLICES HIS MOREL MUSHROOMS 
HE BELIEVES IN UNFUSSY RECIPES 
BASED ON THE FRESHEST INGREDIENTS POSSIBLE 
IT'S A FAIRLY EASY DISH TO COOK 
SO HE HAS PLENTY OF TIME TO SELECT THE BEST PEAS ONE BY ONE 
OBVIOUSLY FOOD COST IS GREAT FOR CHEFS 
ARE YOU ACTUALLY COUNTING PER PEA PER PERSON 
THE SWEETBREADS ARE NOW COOKED TO PERFECTION 
AND CHRIS COMES OVER TO SEE THEM AGAIN 
DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A PHYSICAL FLAVOUR DIFFERENCE 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT IT'S NOT VERY MUCH 
RIGHT IT'S NOT LIKE GAMEY OR NO NO 
JUST BECAUSE IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE ONE MONTH OF THE YEAR I LIKE TO USE IT 
DANNY CAREFULLY SQUEEZES OUT THE PEA PUREE AND MAKES SURE 
THAT EACH SPOON GETS A HELPING OF THE VENISON SWEETBREADS 
ON GOES A GENEROUS SERVING OF MOREL MUSHROOMS 
HE WHIPS UP A MOREL FOAM TOO DELICATELY TOSSES THE SHOOTS 
AND BEANS IN A TASTY DRESSING AND ARRANGES EVERYTHING ON THE PLATE 
SO TO THE GUEST LIKE THAT YES 
NICE ONE MATE VERY NICE 
IT'S GOOD TO SEE THEM GO 
DANNY THINKS HE'S DONE A GOOD JOB WITH HIS SWEETBREADS AND FRESH SHOOTS 
BUT IS THE DISH ALTOGETHER TOO SIMPLE 
AND IS IT CONTEMPORARY ENOUGH FOR HESTON'S CUTTING EDGE BANQUET 
DOWN THE HATCH 
I THINK IT HAD A MOREL ON TOP 
WHICH RATHER UNBALANCES THINGS 
IT DIFFICULT TO TASTE THE SWEETBREAD 
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY THAT WAS MY FIRST VENISON SWEETBREAD 
I THINK I THINK I'LL REFRAIN FROM SAYING THAT 
RESERVE JUDGMENT ON THE VENISON 
WELL I REMEMBER LAST TIME WE DIDN'T THINK IT HAD 
HUGE VISUAL WOW 
I MEAN IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY FANTASTIC PRESENTATION 
BUT IT LOOKS FRESH AND SUMMERY AND IT DOES IT TASTES LOVELY 
THIS IS A BAUHAUS DISH ISN'T IT LESS IS MORE DEFINITELY 
WELL I COULD ACTUALLY SEE THIS HAVING A PLACE AT THE GHERKIN 
AND IT WOULD NOT BE AN EXTRAVAGANT STATEMENT 
IT WOULDN'T BE ALL WHISTLES ALL SINGING ALL DANCING 
BUT THEY'D EAT THIS WITH A SMILE 
ARE WE NOW AT A POINT AT THE PROCEEDINGS 
WHERE YOU THINK NICE IS GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT TO GET THROUGH 
I THINK IT IS BETTER THAN NICE I THINK THIS 
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS A GRAND DISH 
BLAH DI BLAH BLAH NO NO NO 
WE ARE CONSIDERING THINGS IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT LIGHT 
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED NECESSARILY TO HAVE THE VISUAL RAZZLE DAZZLE 
AND ONE'S TASTE BUDS BEING BLUDGEONED INTO SUBMISSION BY ONE THOUSAND ONE TASTES 
THERE'S A MARVELLOUS BUNCH OF CHEFS HERE IN THIS COMPETITION 
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DISHES WHICH ISN'T A MODERN LOOKING DISH 
I MEAN THEY'RE ALL TOP CHEFS 
IF ONE OF THEM CAN'T PRODUCE SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS GREAT 
WHICH FITS ALL THE CRITERIA AND TASTES FANTASTIC 
AND KNOCKS EVERYBODY'S SOCKS OFF LET'S BE A BIT AMBITIOUS 
IT WON'T DO YOU'RE GETTING SO EXCITED PRUE 
YES I AM GOD FANTASTIC 
BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME TIME FOR ANOTHER COURSE 
WELL DANNY'S DISH CERTAINLY GOT PRUE EXERCISED 
IF FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS 
BUT THEY'RE QUEUING UP FOR IT IN THE KITCHEN 
VENISON SWEETBREADS FANTASTIC 
JUST ON THE SPOON YEAH ALL ON THE SPOON YEAH 
FRESHER 
I DON'T THINK THERE ISN'T A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE 
AND WHAT DO THE CHEFS WHO AREN'T TASTING IT WITH DANNY THINK 
I PREFER THE VEAL YEAH WITHOUT A DOUBT 
IT'S A LOVELY DISH BUT IT'S GOT CLASSICAL OVERTONES 
AND ISN'T SAYING MODERN 
IT'S GOT GREAT FLAVOURS IT'S GOT GOOD BALANCE 
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT THE JUDGES ARE LOOKING FOR 
SO IS TOM RIGHT THE JUDGES ARE ABOUT TO GIVE THEIR MARKS 
IT WASN'T FLASHY MAYBE SLIGHTLY UNDER DESIGNED 
BY SOME OF THE STANDARDS OF OTHER DISHES 
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL THING TO EAT 
SO I'M GOING TO GIVE IT A SEVEN 
YES I MEAN I THINK IT MADE UP FOR ITS LOOKS IN FLAVOUR 
AND I'LL GIVE IT A SEVEN 
YOU KNOW I WOULD BE VERY RELUCTANT AS I SAID 
TO PUT THIS DISH OUT IN FRONT OF LOADS OF FOREIGN CHEFS AS OUR FIRST DISH 
IT JUST DIDN'T LOOK STRONG ENOUGH FOR ME 
SO ON THAT BASIS I'LL HAVE TO SAY IT'S A SEVEN 
OUR FINAL CHEF OUT IN THE KITCHEN IS RARING TO GO 
THERE'S NO DANGER OF THE JUDGES GETTING BORED BY REPETITION BECAUSE HE'S SERVING PIGEON 
HE'S HEATING SOME OMEGA RICH SEEDS WITH SOY SAUCE 
AND BLENDING APRICOT WITH AN ALTERNATIVE SUGAR XYLITOL TO MAKE A PUREE 
THE OTHER CHEFS ARE INTERESTED IN HIS HEALTH CONSCIOUS COOKING 
BUT NIGEL IS PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED BY THE CHOICE OF BIRD 
PIGEON IS SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT 
ITS ACTUALLY WILD PIGEON LIKE CURED IN BIRD SAP 
CURED IN BIRCH SAP BIRD SAP 
BIRCH TREE BIRCH TREE SAP 
I THOUGHT YOU SAID BIRD SAP THEN NO NO NO 
GLYN SEEMS A BIT CONFUSED TOO 
WHAT'S THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE 
THE WHOLE THING I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO IS WHAT I'M TERMING THREE DIMENSIONAL CUISINE 
WHICH FOR ME IS BASICALLY IT'S ABOUT PRESENTATION FLAVOUR 
AND THE BIGGEST AREA OF INTEREST I'VE ACTUALLY GOT AT THIS STAGE OF TIME IS NUTRITION 
I ACTUALLY USED NO DAIRY NO SUGAR NO GLUTEN AND NO GELATINE 
THROUGHOUT ALL MY DISHES OF THIS EVENT 
I'M TRYING TO PROVE THAT YOU DON'T NEED ALL THOSE THINGS 
TO HAVE GREAT TASTING GREAT LOOKING FOOD 
AND TO GET TO THE STAGE I'M QUITE PLEASED 
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO WORK YOU KNOW 
WHICH SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT MAYBE I MIGHT BE ON TO SOMETHING 
WELL DANNY CERTAINLY SEEMS IMPRESSED 
BEAUTIFUL LOOKING PLATES THANK YOU 
LOOKS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING O. K. 
SO THAT WAY ROUND GUYS THAT WAY FACING YOU AS THE CUSTOMER 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE SLATE TILE OF PIGEON IN BIRCH SAP WINE IS READY 
WILL THE JUDGES STILL SEE IT AS A HIGH CLASS MODERN MEAL OR JUST AS HEALTH FOOD 
IF YOU'D HAVE ASKED ME ABOUT HEALTH AND COOKING YOU KNOW 
IT'S BLAND I WOULD HAVE SAID YES 
BUT MEETING YOU AND TALKING TO YOU AND SEEING WHAT YOU PRODUCE ISN'T THE CASE OBVIOUSLY 
I JUST LOVE HOW THIS LOOKS 
IT'S LOVELY LET'S FACE IT THIS IS A SENSATIONAL FIRST COURSE 
THIS IS AN OBVIOUS CONTENDER IT IS 
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I SAID THAT WE'VE GOT SEVEN TOP CHEFS HERE 
AND IF ONE OF THEM CAN'T HIT ALL THE BUTTONS 
WE ARE WASTING OUR TIME 
THIS GUY THIS IS CHRIS ISN'T IT HAS HIT EVERY SINGLE BUTTON 
I MEAN IT IS FANTASTIC YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE TASTE IS A PLEASURE AND GOES TOGETHER BEAUTIFULLY 
OF COURSE IT LOOKS AMAZING 
THIS IS HEALTHY IT'S HEALTHY WITHOUT BEING WORTHY 
MY PROBLEM WITH THIS DISH IS IT BREAKS ALMOST EVERY CANON OF MY PERSONAL CREDO 
IT'S LIGHT IT'S HEALTHY BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS 
NO CREAM NO BUTTER AND 
AND IT WOULD NOT BE IMPROVED BY CREAM AND BUTTER 
NO IT WOULD BE RUINED BY CREAM EXACTLY IT'S WONDERFUL 
YOU KNOW ANY CHEF COMING TO THE GHERKIN 
IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY EXCITED TO EAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW 
I'VE BEEN IN QUITE A FEW RESTAURANTS AND THIS SORT OF THING DOES NOT POP UP EVERY DAY 
IT THERE'S MORE MODERN BRITISH COOKING LIKE THIS THEN THE FUTURE OF BRITISH COOKING IS PRETTY BRIGHT 
EXACTLY 
SO HAS CHRIS MANAGED TO CONVERT THE OTHER CHEFS TOO 
PIGEON FIGHT ITS WAY THROUGH 
I LOST IT FOR SORT OF A MINUTE OR A SECOND OR TWO 
THE PUREE IS A BIT OVERPOWERING YEAH BUT THE PIGEON IS LOVELY 
LOOK OUT HE'S BEHIND YOU 
DON'T BE SHY YOU'RE ALL BIGGER THAN ME 
WHAT DO WE THINK GUYS HONEST OPINIONS 
I LIKE THE PIGEON I LIKE THE SEEDS 
THE ONLY THING I'D SAY IS THERE'S PROBABLY A BIT TOO MUCH PUREE 
IN RELATION TO THE MEAT BECAUSE IT WAS QUITE SHARP 
THIS HAS BEEN PUT TOGETHER AS A STARTER BECAUSE THE PUREE IS FULL OF ANTIOXIDANTS FULL OF VITAMIN C. 
IT'S A FRUIT AND IT SETS YOUR STOMACH ON FOR THREE MORE COURSES IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THE MEAT 
IF I'D KNOWN THE PUREE WAS THE MAIN INGREDIENT I'D HAVE SAID WELL THE PUREE CAME OUT VERY WELL 
CHRIS WE'RE DEFINITELY IN AGREEMENT IT'S MODERN BRITISH FOOD 
BUT SOME OF THEM JUST DON'T SEEM TO BE TUNED TO CHRIS'S WAY OF THINKING 
I'M NOT SURPRISED TO SEE THREE CHEFS SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS GOING MAYBE THE FRUIT PUREE IS TOO MUCH ETC 
THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT IT FROM THE SAME ANGLE AS I AM 
I SIMPLY COULDN'T FAULT IT AS A PIECE OF IMAGINATION AS A PIECE OF COOKING 
IN TERMS OF FLAVOUR COMBINATIONS 
IT WAS AT EVERY SINGLE LEVEL A TRULY WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE TO EAT 
I'VE NO CHOICE BUT TO GIVE IT TEN 
TO ME IT WAS AN AMAZING DISH 
I'VE HAD NOTHING LIKE THAT EVER BEFORE IN THIS COUNTRY 
I'D BE PROUD TO HAVE IT AT THE GHERKIN 
FOR THAT REASON I'D GIVE IT A TEN 
I LOVED THE FACT IT WAS AS LIGHT AS ANYTHING TO EAT AND TOTALLY HEALTHY WITHOUT FEELING AT ALL WORTHY 
MY SLIGHT NIGGLE IS THAT I DIDN'T QUITE SEE WHAT THE VIOLET LEAVES WERE FOR 
AND PETALS THE FLORAL PETALS 
TO BE TOTALLY PURIST I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM NINE 
WHICH IS MY HIGHEST SCORE 
YOU'RE WORKING HARD 
IT'S ALL OVER 
ALL THE CHEFS CAN DO NOW IS WAIT 
AND TRY TO SECOND GUESS THE JUDGES 
TOP THREE JASE GLYN AND THE BIG MAN 
NIGEL JASON 
CHRIS OR TOM I'M NOT SURE 
JASON GLYN CHRIS 
IT'S STIFF COMPETITION IS IT NOT YEAH 
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT LONG TO FIND OUT 
THE CHEFS HAVE BEEN SUMMONED TO THE JUDGES' CHAMBER TO HEAR THE VERDICT 
VERY GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN 
I'M SURE YOU'RE RELIEVED TO GET THE FIRST COURSE UNDER YOUR BELT 
WE'RE RELIEVED TO GET UNDER OURS AS WELL MY BELT IS A GOOD DEAL TIGHTER THIS EVENING THAN THIS MORNING 
SO IN SEVENTH PLACE 
IS STEPHEN TERRY 
WELL THAT WON'T SURPRISE STEPHEN CONSIDERING WHAT HE WAS UP AGAINST 
IT WAS NEVER GOING TO BE ANYTHING MORE 
IN SIXTH PLACE IS 
NIGEL HOWARTH 
WHICH MUST BE A SHOCK FOR HIM 
THE OTHER CHEFS REALLY RATED HIS HOTPOT 
AND IN FIFTH PLACE 
GLYN PURNELL 
THAT'S A BLOW FOR GLYN HE THOUGHT HE'D DO BETTER 
HE WAS NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD THIS TIME AS THE PREVIOUS TIME 
THE LOLLIPOP ALL YOU COULD TASTE WAS CARMELISATION NOTHING ELSE 
IT WAS A PITY BECAUSE I HAD SUCH HOPES FOR THAT DISH 
GLYN'S LOSS IS SOMEONE ELSE'S GAIN 
AND SO IN FOURTH PLACE 
IS DANNY MILLAR 
WELL I THINK DANNY WILL BE PLEASED WITH THAT 
NOT A BAD RESULT AT ALL 
IT IS BY PURE COINCIDENCE THAT WE HAVE JASON TOM AND CHRIS ALL SITTING ON THE STOOLS IN FRONT 
THIS WASN'T ORGANISED 
AND IT WAS VERY TOUGH 
WE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE TWO OF YOU 
SO TIED IN SECOND PLACE 
TOM 
AND JASON ATHERTON 
IT SIMPLY MEANS CHRIS HORRIDGE YOURS WAS THE FINEST DISH ON THE DAY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHEERS GUYS 
CONGRATULATIONS WELL DONE YEAH WELL DONE 
NONE OF US HAD EVER TASTED ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT BEFORE 
IT WAS DISTINCTLY BRITISH IT WAS MODERN IT WAS SEASONAL 
CHRIS IT WAS A REAL TRIUMPH 
TO BE THAT DELICIOUS AND HEALTHY I HAD TO OVERCOME A DEEP PREJUDICE 
ARE YOU STARTING TO BE CONVERTED MATTHEW IS THAT IT 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER DISHES I ATE WITH PLEASURE 
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE COLOUR ARRANGEMENT ON THAT PIECE OF SLATE 
MADE THE WHOLE THING REALLY PULL TOGETHER AND TASTE WELL TOGETHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
TOM AND JASON I MUST SAY TWO ABSOLUTELY STUNNING PIECES OF COOKING 
WITH A GREAT DEAL OF HUMOUR BEHIND THEM 
THIS ISN'T THE END OF THE STORY I'M NOT SURE IT'S EVEN THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE STORY 
THERE ARE THREE MORE COURSES TO GO YOU'VE SET AN EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH STANDARD FOR YOURSELVES
