GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE SIX 
O'CLOCK NEWS 
GORDON BROWN HAS CHOSEN THE UN 
SECURITY COUNCIL TO ISSUE HIS 
STERNEST REBUKE YET TO ZIMBABWE'S 
ROBERT MUGABE HE ACCUSED MR. MUGABE 
OF STEALING THE RECENT ELECTION 
THE COMMENTS HAVE PUT THE PRIME 
MINISTER ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH 
AFRICAN LEADERS WHO HAVE REFUSED 
TO CONDEMN EVENTS INSIDE ZIMBABWE 
A MEETING HE WAS DUE TO HAVE WITH 
SOUTH AFRICA'S PRESIDENT THABO 
MBEKI WAS CAN SE NICK ROBINSON IS 
TRAVELLING WITH GORDON BROWN WAS 
CANCELLED CANCELLED IT'S TAKEN A TRIP TO NEW YORK AND 
MORE THAN TWO WEEKS SINCE THE 
PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE VOTED FOR 
GORDON BROWN TO FINALLY SAY IT 
ROBERT MUGABE IS TRYING TO STEAL AN 
ELECTION ELECTION TIME TO ACT SAID THE BANNER FLOWN 
ABOVE THE UNITED NATIONS TODAY AS 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL GATHERED TO 
DISCUSS AFRICA BIZARRELY SOME 
WANTED ZIMBABWE KEPT OFF THE AGENDA 
NOT SO GORDON BROWN 
NO ONE THINKS HAVING SEEN THE 
RESULTS AT POLLING STATIONS THAT 
PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS WON THIS 
ELECTION A STOLEN ELECTION WOULD 
NOT BE A DEMOCRATIC ELECTION AT ALL 
AS THE GENERAL SECRETARY HAS SAID 
THE CREDIBILITY OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PROCESS DEPENDS ON THERE BEING A 
LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT SO LET A 
SINGLE CLEAR MESSAGE GO OUT FROM 
HERE IN NEW YORK THAT WE ARE AND 
WILL BE VIGILANT FOR DEMOCRATIC 
RIGHTS 
UNTIL NOW BRITAIN HAS RIGHTS BACKED PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI'S SO 
CALLED QUIET DIPLOMACY SO QUIET HE 
DIDN'T MENTION ZIMBABWE TODAY AND 
INSIST THERE ISS NO CRISIS WHAT WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN AROUND THE TABLE IS 
THE DETERMINATION OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COUNTRIES 
FROM AFRICA ASIA AND FROM EUROPE 
SAYING THAT THE RESULTS HAVE TO BE 
PUBLISHED AND TRANSPARENT AND 
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ABOVE BOARD 
THE PRIME MINISTER NOW HOPES THAT 
THE UNITED NATIONS WILL PLAY MUCH 
BIGGER ROLE IN CONFRONTING MUGABE 
IT IS NOT HIS WORDS THOUGH OR HIS 
VISIT THAT'S MAKING NEWS HERE THIS THIS MORNING POPE BENEDICT ARRIVES 
GORDON BROWN IS HAVING TO WORK VERY 
VERY HARD TO GET ANY ATTENTION HERE 
IT IS ONE OF THE BEST JOBS IN THE 
WORLD AND ONE OF THE MOST 
CHALLENGING 
YOU CAN COME BACK TO CHALLENGING AMERICAN T. V. HERE IF YOU LIKE SOME 
DAY 
I LOVE AMERICA AND I WILL HAVE DAY WATCHING AMERICAN T. V. 
CAN THEY 
LEARN TO LOVE HIM AS THEY ONCE 
LOVED TONY BLAIR 
NICK IT WAS INTERESTING THAT 
GORDON BROWN RESERVED HIS MOST 
STERNEST COMMENTS THERE FOR THE 
UNITED NATIONS' SECURITY COUNCIL ON 
ZIMBABWE 
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S THE ZIMBABWE FIRST TIME HE HAS SPOKEN IN THIS 
WAY AND HE HAS DONE IT ABROAD NOT 
AT HOME BUT HERE AT THE UN NOW 
THERE IS A GOOD REASON FOR THAT 
GEORGE ANY BRITISH PRIME MINISTER 
ALWAYS FEARS IF THEY SPEAK OUT 
AGAINST ROBERT MUGABE AGAINST 
ZIMBABWE THAT MERELY RALLIES 
SUPPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT INDEED 
NOT JUST IN ZIMBABWE ITSELF BUT IN 
AFRICA AS A WHOLE BUT FINALLY 
GORDON BROWN HAS A LOST HIS 
PATIENCE AND B. IS TRYING TO 
INTERNATIONALISE THIS NOT MAKE IT 
BRITAIN V. ZIMBABWE OR OTHER AFRICAN 
STATES DEALING WITH IT BUT THE 
GLOBAL COMMUNITY LED BY THE UN 
THEY WILL HAVE TO HOPE THAT MUGABE 
WILL LISTEN BUT WE HAVE BEEN 
WAITING FOR A LONG TIME 
THEN WE 
SAW A VERY DIFFERENT PRIME MINISTER 
ON THE BREAKFAST COUCH IF I CAN PUT 
IT LIKE THAT SAYING HOW MUCH HE 
LIKED AMERICA AND HOW MUCH AMERICAN 
T. V. 
HE IS DESPERATELY TRYING TO GET T. V. ATTENTION TO BE LIKED QUITE FRANKLY 
HE WILL STRUGGLE BECAUSE THE POPE 
IS IN TOWN BEING MET BY THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE IT IS A HUGE STORY THE 
PRESIDENT MET WITH HIM TODAY AND 
GORDON BROWN FRANKLY IS A MINOR 
STORY HERE IN AMERICAN TELEVISION 
TERMS AND NEWSPAPERS TOO BUT HE 
ALSO WANTS TO TRY TO GET SOME OF 
THE SUPPORT THAT TONY BLAIR USED TO 
GET HIS REAL PROBLEM IS VERY 
SIMPLE PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW WHO HE 
IS I DO NOT MEAN ORDINARY FOLK L. 
ALSO MEAN IN CONGRESS ONE MAN WHO 
IS HEAVILY INVOLVED IN TRYING TO 
PROMOTE GOOD RELATIONS BETWEEN 
BRITAIN AND AMERICA A CONGRESSMAN 
I WAS SPEAKING TO SAYS THE 
DIFFICULTY IN BEING LISTENED TO IS 
IF NOBODY KNOWS WHO YOU ARE THEY 
DON'T LISTEN 
ZIMBABWE APART 
GORDON BROWN IS MEETING AMERICAN 
BANKERS IN NEW YORK TONIGHT IT IS 
PART OF HIS ATTEMPT TO TACKLE THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH THAT'S CAUSING HAVOC 
HERE ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE TRYING 
TO BORROW FOR A NEW HOME THE B. B. C. 
HAS LEARNED THAT THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND IS POISED TO INTERVENE IN A 
WAY IT HAS NOT DONE SO FAR BREAK 
THE LENDING LOGJAM OUR ECONOMICS 
EDITOR STEPHANIE FLANDERS IS WITH 
ME TO TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS WHAT IS 
GOING ON AND WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR 
BORROWERS 
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY BORROWERS BANKS ARE PUTTING UP THEIR MORTGAGE 
RATES AND ARE MUCH LESS WILLING TO 
LEND TO ALL OF US IS THEY ARE 
HAVING TROUBLE BORROWING ON THE 
MONEY MARKETS AND THE MARKETS WHERE 
THEY BORROW AND THROND EACH OTHER 
THEY ARE SITTING ON MORTGAGE BASED 
ASSETS THAT BANKS SAY THEY ARE NOT 
SURE WHAT THEY ARE WORTH I'M NOT 
SURE I WILL LEND TO YOU AGAINST 
THEM THE BANK OF ENGLAND IF IT 
CAN WORK OUT THE DETAILS WANTS IT 
INTERVENE AS A MIDDLE MAN AND SAYS 
COME TO US WITH YOUR MORTGAGE 
BACKED ASSETS WE WILL GIVE YOU 
CLEAN GOVERNMENT WANTS WHICH I CAN 
LEND TO OTHER BANKS AND THAT SHOULD 
BREAK THE LOGJAM BECAUSE IF THERE 
IS MORE LENDING AND LOWER RATES 
BETWEEN THE BANKS THE BANKS WILL 
BE HEAVIER LENDING TO US 
THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND MIGHT INTERVENE BUT WHO 
WILL PICK UP THE BILL 
THE TREASURY 
HAS TO BACK IT THE BANK DOESN'T 
HAVE THE MONEY TO BE ISSUING 
GOVERNMENT BONDS BUT I UNDERSTAND 
THEY WILL NOT GO THROUGH WITH THIS 
PLAN IF THEY DON'T FEEL THE TAX 
PAYER IS PROTECTED ONE OF THE WAYS 
THEY COULD PROTECT THE TAX PAYER IS 
EXCHANGING THE ASSETS AT A DISCOUNT 
SO EVEN IF THE VALUE GOES DOWN A 
LOT THE TAX PAYER HAS A CUSHION 
WHERE THE PRICE CAN CONTINUE GOING 
DOWN BUT SOME EXPERTS SAY IT 
WILL'S BE DIFFICULT TO PROTECT THE 
TAX PAYER COMPLETELY 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK 
HAS FALLEN BY THIRTY NINE THOUSAND IN THE THREE 
MONTHS UNTIL THE END OF FEBRUARY TO 
ONE POINT SIX MILLION THE OFFICE FOR 
NATIONAL STATISTICS SAYS THE NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE IN WORK IS THE HIGHEST 
SINCE RECORDS BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE 
THE MOTHER OF SHANNON MATTHEWS THE 
NINE YEAR OLD WHO DISAPPEARED IN 
FEBRUARY IS TO GO ON TRIAL 
CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH HER 
DAUGHTER'S ALLEGED ABDUCTION KAREN 
MATTHEWS IS ACCUSED OF CHILD 
NEGLECT AND PERVERTING THE COURSE 
OF JUSTICE SHE WILL BE TRIED 
ALONGSIDE MICHAEL DONOVAN WHO IS 
CHARGED WITH SHANNON'S KIDNAPPING 
AND FALSE IMPRISONMENT 
THROUGHOUT THE TIME SHANNON 
MATTHEWS WAS MISSING KAREN 
MATTHEWS REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR HER 
SAFE RETURN THE DAY AFTER HER 
DAUGHTER VANISHED SHE MADE THIS 
APPEAL 
SHANNON IF YOU ARE OUT APPEAL THERE PLEASE COME HOME WE LOVE 
YOU TO BITS WE MISS YOU SO MUCH 
WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH PLEASE COME 
HOME SHANNON 
WITH DETECTIVES 
EXPRESSING GRAVE CONCERN FOR THE 
MISSING NINE YEAR OLD TWO WEEKS' 
LATER HER MOTHER ANSWERED 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SEARCH DO YOU 
BELIEVE THE ANSWER LIES LOCALLY 
THAT SOMEBODY KNOWS SOMETHING WHAT 
DO YOU FEEL 
I FEEL THAT SOMEBODY 
OUT THERE WHO WILL KNOW SHANNON I 
SUPPOSE THEY WILL PROBABLY KNOW ME 
AS WELL L. JUST WANT HER HOME SAFE REALLY 
BUT JUST OVER A WEEK AGO REALLY AND LONG AFTER SHANNON WAS FOUND 
KAREN MATTHEWS WAS ARRESTED SHE 
WAS THEN CHARGED WITH CHILD NEGLECT 
AND REPEATEDLY CONCEALING 
INFORMATION IN RELATION IT 
SHANNON'S WHEREABOUTS 
KAREN MATTHEWS' CASE TODAY CAME 
HERE TO LEEDS CROWN COURT WHERE A 
JUDGE TOLD HER THAT SHE WOULD STAND 
TRIAL IN NOVEMBER ALONGSIDE 
MICHAEL DONOVAN THE MAN ACCUSED OF 
KIDNAPPING AND FALSELY IMPRISONING 
SHANNON SHANNON IT WAS IN HIS FLAT WHERE THE LITTLE 
GIRL WAS FOUND IN THE BASE OF A BED 
HE IS CURRENTLY ON REMAND IN LEEDS' 
PRISON BUT WHEN MICHAEL DN VAN 
STANDS TRIAL NEXT TO HIM IN THE 
DOCK WILL BE SHANNON'S MOTHER 
WHEN MICHAEL DONOVAN STANDS TRIAL 
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU 
HEALTHY BUT IT SEEMS VITAMIN PILLS 
COULD DO YOU MORE HARM THAN GOOD 
RESEARCHERS IN DENMARK SAY FAR FROM 
PROLONGING OUR LIVES SOME COULD BE 
HARMFUL IN LARGE DOSES AND LEAD 
TO AN EARLIER DEATH OUR MEDICAL 
CORRESPONDENT FERGUS WALSH IS HERE 
TO EXPLAIN WELL RESEARCHERS 
ANALYSED SIXTY SEVEN CLINICAL TRIALS 
INVOLVING TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE TO TRY TO 
FIND OUT THE EFFECTS OF ANTIOXIDANT 
VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS ON HEALTH 
THERE IS NO DOUBT MANY BRITONS 
BELIEVE THEY WORK SALES ARE WORTH 
THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION A YEAR AND THEY ARE 
TAKEN BY FOUR IN TEN ADULTS BUT 
THE FINDINGS WERE WORRYING VITAMIN 
A SUPPLEMENTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH 
A SIXTEEN PER CENT INCREASED MORTALITY RISK 
A SUPPLEMENTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH A SIXTEEN PER CENT INCREASED MORTALITY RISK 
BETA CAROTENE WHICH THE BODY 
CONVERTS INTO VITAMIN A WAS LINKED 
TO A SEVEN PER CENT INCREASED RISK AND VITAMIN 
E. TO A FOUR PER CENT INCREASE FOR BOTH 
VITAMIN C. AND SELENIUM THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE EITHER WAY FOR POSITIVE OR 
NEGATIVE EFFECTS SO HOW ARE 
ANTIOXIDANT SUPPLEMENTS SUPPOSED TO 
HELP WELL FREE RADICALS ARE 
MOLECULES IN THE BODY WHICH CAN 
SLOWLY DAMAGE TISSUE OVERTIME 
CAUSING AGEING AND DISEASE MANY 
BELIEVE THE ANTIOXIDANTS IN THE 
VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS CAN MOP UP OR 
NEUTRALISE THE FREE RADICALS 
PROMOTING GOOD HEALTH BUT IT IS 
POSSIBLE IT COULD ALSO HAVE 
DAMAGING EFFECTS IN LARGE DOSES 
YOU MIGHT BE TAKING A MULTI VITAMIN 
FISH OILS ANDICAL SEEM IS IT 
PROBABLY A GOOD COMBINATION FOR 
ELDERLY PEOPLE BUT IF YOU ARE 
TAKING ANTIOXIDANTS AS WELL YOU 
COULD BE DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD 
THERE ARE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS THAT 
INCREASE THE RISK OF THE DANGERS A A HEALTHY DIE SET BEST AND MOST 
NATURAL SOURCE OF VITAMINS BUT ONLY 
ONE IN FOUR ADULTS MANAGES FIVE 
PORTIONS OF FRUIT AND VEG A DAY 
AREN'T SUPPLEMENTS A GOOD IDEA 
JUST BECAUSE WE NEED SOME DOESN'T 
NECESSARILY MEAN MORE IS BETTER AND 
MORE CAN IMBALANCE OUR SYSTEM MUCH 
IT IS BETTER TO GET THEM FROM FOOD 
IN ADDITION FOOD WILL GIVE YOU ALL 
SORTS OF OTHER THINGS YOU WON'T GET 
FROM A SUPPLEMENT IT IS AN ADDED 
BENEFIT LOOKING AT YOUR DIET 
RATHER THAN LOOKING AT TAKING A 
PILL 
IT IS ACTUALLY MORE THAN A PILL YEAR SINCE THIS WORRYING RESEARCH 
WAS FIRST PUBLISHED YET THERE HAS 
BEEN NO DROP IN SALES OF VITAMIN 
SUPPLEMENTS IT SEEMS MANY OF US 
PREFER TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH 
HEALTH RISKS WE TAKE NOTE OF 
ANOTHER MAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN 
CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE 
SCHOOLBOY RHYS JONES THE ELEVEN YEAR 
OLD WAS SHOT DEAD IN AUGUST LAST 
YEAR AS HE WALKED HOME THE POLICE 
ARE ALSO CONTINUING TO QUESTION ELEVEN 
PEOPLE ARRESTED YESTERDAY

DRUGS OVERDOSE IN THE FLAT THEY

STUDY BY TWO CHIEF CONSTABLES SAYS

SOME AREAS BUT OVERALL CRIME

FEBRUARY BEFORE HE LEFT HE TOLD A 
LOCAL NEWSPAPER WHY HE WANTED TO

FATALLY INJURED BY A ROADSIDE BOMB 
NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS HAVE BEEN 
SHOCKED BY THE NEWS OF HIS DEATH I I JUST FEEL SO MUCH FOR THE FAMILY

WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT GOING IT 
WAS SOMETHING HE WANTED TO DO AND 
THEY SUPPORTED HIM IN THAT IT IS 
SO TRAGIC IT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM A A KEEN RUGBY PLAYER HIS CLUB WILL BE 
HOLDING A MINUTE'S SILENCE AT THE 
GAME THIS WEEKEND

ALL VERY VERY HARD HE WAS SUCH AN 
ENORMOUSLY POPULAR GUY EVERYONE 
KNEW HIM EVERYBODY PLAYED FOR HIM 
AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER WHETHER YOU 
ARE A NEW STARTER YOU ALWAYS 
STARTED WITH GOERY EVEN SOME OF 
THE SENIOR PLAYS WOULD SOMETIMES

OUR TOP STORY GORDON BROWN TELLS 
THE UNITED NATIONS THAT ROBERT 
MUGABE STILL THE ELECTION FROM THE 
PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE STORE THE 
ELECTION COMING UP FROM SCI FI 
TO G. I. HOW THE U. S. IS TURNING 
SOLDIERS INTO ROBOTS LATER FROM 
EASTENDERS TO EAST HIGH LETITIA 
DEAN'S NEW ROLE IN HIGH SCHOOL 
MUSICAL PLUS THE EXTREME SPORT OF 
FREERUNNING HOW COMPETITORS ARE 
GEARING UP FOR THE FIRST WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 
PREVENTING MUSLIM YOUTHS TURNING TO 
TERROR IS BETTER THAN TRYING TO 
STOP THEM ONCE THEY'VE COMMITTED A 
CRIME THAT'S THE MESSAGE FROM HOME 
SECRETARY JACQUI SMITH AS SHE 
ANNOUNCED THE DEPLOYMENT OF AN 
EXTRA THREE HUNDRED POLICE OFFICERS AND 
SUPPORT STAFF WHO WILL WORK WITH 
MOSQUES SHE SAID BRITAIN COULD NOT 
ARREST ITS WAY OUT OF THE PROBLEM 
WHAT YOU HAVE WHAT IS NOW WAS ONLY 
THE BEGINNING 
BE POSTHUMOUS 
WORDS OF SHEHZAD TANWEER ONE OF 
THE BOMBER'S RADICALISED IN BRITAIN 
THE TRUSTEE THAT HE AND HIS 
ACCOMPLICES COMMITTED THREE YEARS 
AGO WAS A TURNING POINT FOR THE 
POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICES THEY 
KNEW BRITONS COULD BOMB THEIR OWN 
PEOPLE HERE AND REALISED BELATEDLY 
THEY HAD TO DO MORE TO TACKLE 
EXTREMISM AT ITS ROOTS THE 
DEPLOYMENT OF THREE HUNDRED NEW COUNTER 
TERRORISM POLICE OFFICERS INTENDED 
TO HELP HEAD OFF THAT EXTREMISM IN 
THE COMMUNITY WORKING WITH SCHOOLS 
MOSQUES AND PRISONS 
THIS IS A NEW 
DEPARTURE THIS IS ABOUT IF WE ARE 
FACING A GENERATIONAL PROBLEM OF 
VIOLENT EXTREMISM AND THE THREAT OF 
TERRORISM THEN WHAT WE NEED TO DO 
NOW TO STOP WORKING WITH THE KIDS 
IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS NOW THEY 
MIGHT BE THE EXTREMISTS OF TEN YEARS 
FROM NOW THIS IS ABOUT WORKING 
UPSTREAM IN DIVERTING PEOPLE AWAY 
FROM IT THAT PATH 
INSIDE M. I. FIVE 
HEADQUARTERS AND YOU PREVENTING 
EXTREMISM UNIT HAS BEEN SET UP 
FEEDING INTELLIGENCE TO THE POLICE 
AS PART OF A MULTI LAYERED APPROACH 
FOR'S COUNTER TERRORISM STRATEGY 
HAS FOUR MAIN ELEMENTS PURSUE 
TERRORISTS CATCH THEM AND CHARGE 
THEM PROTECT BRITAIN'S 
INFRASTRUCTURE QUAYSIDES AND 
BORDERS PREPARE FOR ANY 
CATASTROPHIC ATTACK LASTLY 
PREVENT RADICALISATION WHICH CAN 
LEAD TO VIOLENT EXTREMISM TODAY'S 
ANNOUNCEMENT FALLS INTO THIS LAST 
CATEGORY BUT IT MAY NOT BE POPULAR 
I'M SADDENED TO SAY THIS BUT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAD FAILED TO HAVE 
HONEST AND OPEN DEBATE ABOUT THE 
REAL ISSUE THE REAL ISSUE WHICH 
YOUNG MUSLIMS FEEL ABOUT STRONGLY 
HIS FOREIGN POLICY YET THE 
GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO EVEN DISCUSS 
THIS I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US AS 
COUNTRY TO HAVE AN OPEN AND HONEST 
DEBATE ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES OF HOW 
TO TACKLE EXTREMISM 
BRING IT ON 
SAYS THE HOME OFFICE US OFFICIALS 
SAY THEY RECOGNISE MUSLIM 
GRIEVANCES EXIST THEY WANT TO 
ADDRESS THEM AND THEY WELCOME SUCH 
A DEBATE BUT FOR THOSE ALREADY 
RADICALISED IT COULD BE TOO LATE 
THIS MORNING THE CONSERVATIVE SAY 
MATING THAT ANNOUNCEMENT BROKE 
ELECTION RULES MAKING THAT 
ANNOUNCEMENT THEY HAVE LAUNCHED A 
COMPLAINT FOR MAKING THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE RUN UP TO THE 
NEXT LOCAL ELECTIONS THEY CLAIMED 
POLICE AUTHORITIES ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY ARE CUTTING THE NUMBER OF 
POLICE OFFICERS EVEN BY THE 
STANDARDS OF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN 
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS TODAY 
HAS BEEN ABOUT FIERCE CLASHES AT 
LEAST TWENTY TWO PEOPLE HAVE DIED 
INCLUDING A NUMBER OF PALESTINIAN 
CHILDREN KILLED WHEN ISRAEL 
RESPONDED TO A HAMAS AMBUSH THAT 
LEFT THREE OF ITS SOLDIERS DEAD 
OUR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT HAS 
SENT THIS REPORT TO THE VIOLENCE 
IN GAZA HAS NEVER REALLY STOPPED 
BUT OVER THE PAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT HAS 
INTENSIFIED ISRAELI FORCES RAIDED 
OVERNIGHT KILLING FOUR PALESTINIAN 
FIGHTERS THEN THREE ISRAELI 
SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IN AN AMBUSH 
THE SKIRMISHING CONTINUED 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE ISRAELIS 
CALLED AN AIR STRIKE EYEWITNESSES 
SAY A HELICOPTER FIRED A MISSILE AT 
A GROUP OF PEOPLE ON THE STREET 
CIVILIANS WERE KILLED THEY 
INCLUDED CHILDREN AGED BETWEEN FIVE 
AND FIFTEEN HAMAS SAID IT WOULD 
CONTINUE TO FIGHT AGAINST THE 
ISRAELI BLOCKADE THE OCCUPATION OF 
PALESTINIAN LAND THERE WILL BE 
WORSE TO COME HE SAYS IF ISRAEL 
CONTINUES TO HURT US ISRAELI 
INFANTRY REGROUPED AFTER THE FIRST 
CLASHES WE'VE LOST THREE MEN THE 
OFFICER TELLS THEM WE CAN'T ACCEPT 
THAT WE WILL GO BACK FIND AS MANY 
TERRORISTS AS POSSIBLE AND KILL 
THEM BEING OUT IN THE OPEN WAS 
DANGEROUS IN GAZA TODAY IT'S NOT 
KNOWN IF ANYONE WAS KILLED IN THIS 
CAR BUT ELSEWHERE A PALESTINIAN 
CAMERAMAN WITH THE REUTERS NEWS 
AGENCY WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO DIED 
ISRAEL SAYS THERE WILL BE MORE AIR 
STRIKES AND MORE GROUND INCURSIONS 
INTO GAZA AS LONG AS PALESTINIAN 
ATTACKS CONTINUE EGYPT HAS BEEN 
TRYING TO BROKER A CEASEFIRE SO 
FAR IT'S BEEN ABOUT SUCCESS AND 
WHAT OF THE PEACE PROCESS BETWEEN 
ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN 
AUTHORITY TODAY THAT IS LOOKING 
SIMPLY IRRELEVANT HE LED ENGLAND 
TO RUGBY WORLD CUP GLORY IN TWO THOUSAND THREE 
NOW MARTIN JOHNSON HAS TO DO IT ALL 
OVER AGAIN BUT THIS TIME HE WILL 
BE THE TEAM MANAGER HE IS 
REPLACING BRIAN ASHTON AND WILL BE 
IN CHARGE AT LEAST UNTIL THE NEXT 
RUGBY WORLD CUP IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN KEVIN 
GEARY LOOKS AT THE MAN AND HIS 
MISSION HE WAS A COLOSSUS ON THE 
PITCH A MAN WHOSE DRIVE AND 
RESOLVE INSPIRED HIS TEAM AND 
PROPELLED ENGLAND TO THE PINNACLE 
OF THE GAME WORLD CUP WINNER 
GRAND SLAM WINNER THE PLAYING 
CREDENTIALS ARE IMPECCABLE BUT 
THERE'S MUCH MORE TO MARTIN JOHNSON 
WHOSE SHEER PRESENCE FOCUS AND 
AUTHORITY COMMAND INSTANT RESPECT 
THAT'S WHAT THOSE WHO RUN ENGLISH 
RUGBY MOST ADMIRE 
MARTIN WILL HAVE 
FULL MANAGERIAL CONTROL OF THE 
ENGLAND TEAM INCLUDING THE 
APPOINTMENT OF THE COACHING AND 
MANAGEMENT TEAM AS WELL AS THE PLAY 
A SELECTION PROCESS 
SINCE THAT 
WORLD CUP TRIUMPH AND JOHNSON'S 
RETIREMENT ENGLAND HAVE BEEN AN 
ENIGMA SIR CLIVE WOODWARD RESIGNED 
TO BE REPLACED BY ANDY ROBINSON 
WHOSE REIGN WAS TERMINATED BY AN 
APPALLING STRING OF RESULTS BUT 
STEPS BRIAN ASHTON RESULTS 
IMPROVED AND HE TOOK THEM TO THE 
WORLD CUP FINAL ONLY A FEW MONTHS 
AGO BUT GOOD PERFORMANCES HAVE 
BEEN COUNTERBALANCED BY BAD AND 
MOST IN RUGBY AGREE THAT TURN INTO 
JOHNSON NOW HAS 
THE RIGHT MOVE OFF OFF THE FIELD HE MADE THINGS HAPPEN 
BETWEEN THE MANAGEMENT AND PLAYERS 
AND ON THE FIELD HE WAS LEADING 
FROM THE FRONT HE WAS ALWAYS 
SETTING THE BAR EXTREMELY HIGH HE 
WAS SETTING THE EXAMPLES FOR THE 
REST OF US TO FOLLOW ENGLAND BEGAN 
AT THE MOMENT 
THE RFU WANTED A MAN 
WITH ABSOLUTE CLARITY OF PURPOSE 
AND MARTIN JOHNSON IS CERTAINLY 
THAT HE HAS ALREADY SHOWN AS MUCH 
BY INSISTING HAVING HIS OWN 
COACHING TEAM WHICH WILL SPELL THE 
END FOR THE CURRENT HEAD COACH 
BRIAN ASHTON BUT THERE ARE RISKS 
HE HAS A MANAGERIAL OR COACHING 
EXPERIENCE AS BRIAN ASHTON 
PREPARES TO PACK HIS BAGS HE WILL 
REFLECT ON HOW SHABBILY HE HAS BEEN 
TREATED ONLY LAST AUTUMN HE TOOK 
ENGLAND TO THE WORLD CUP FINAL BUT 
HE WASN'T CONSULTED OVER JOHNSON'S 
APPOINTMENT JOHNSON WILL BE GOING 
ON THIS SUMMER'S TOUR OF NEW 
ZEALAND FOR PERSONAL REASONS 
INSTEAD HE WILL BE STARTING WORK 
ON HOW TO PUT THE WHEELS BACK ON A 
CHARIOT 
FIRST THERE WAS THE TERMINATOR 
THEN CAME ROBOCOP NOW THE 
TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS ONCE JUST THE 
STUFF OF HOLLYWOOD FANTASY IS BEING 
USED BY THE AMERICAN MILITARY THE 
U. S. ARMY IS DEVELOPING ROBOTICS IT'S 
FOR ITS SOLDIERS WITH THE AIM OF 
GIVING THEM SUPERHUMAN POWERS 
RAJESH MIRCHANDANI HAS BEEN TO UTAH 
TO WATCH THEM IN ACTION THE 
RESEARCH FACILITY IN UTAH THE ARE 
TURNING SCI FI INTO REALITY A BIT 
LIKE THE FORTHCOMING FILM IRONMAN 
SCIENTISTS HERO BUILDING A ROBOTICS 
SUED FOR SOLDIERS 
IT DOESN'T 
REQUIRE ANY EFFORT FOR ME TO MOVE 
AROUND 
IT WEIGHS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AROUND CAN YOU FEEL IT 
NOW YOU DON'T 
REALLY FEEL THE WEIGHT THE THE ROBOTICS IT FOLLOWS A TEST 
ENGINEERS MOVEMENTS WITH IT HE CAN 
EASILY PULL DOWN MORE THAN NINETY KILOS 
MORE THAN HIS OWN WEIGHT LOOK WHAT 
IT'S LIKE ABOUT IT THE ARMENIAN 
EXOSKELETON PROVIDES ENORMOUS 
STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE ALAN 
MILLION EXOSKELETON 
PEOPLE ARE 
OBSESSED WITH THIS IDEA OF ADDING 
CAPABILITY I THINK THEY ARE 
INTERESTED IN THE IDEA YOU CAN FLY 
PICK UP LARGE WEIGHTS THAT MATCH 
YOUR OWN WEIGHT IT'S INSPIRING 
FOR THE ARMY THIS KIND OF KID 
COULD MEAN QUICKER SUPPLY LINES OR 
FEWER INJURIES DURING HEAVY LIFTING 
THEY ARE INVESTING HEAVILY IN IT 
ITS COST THE U. S. MILITARY TENS OF 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND DEVELOPMENT 
TO GET TO THIS STAGE THE IDEA IS 
IT COULD SAVE TIME MONEY AND 
POTENTIALLY SAVE LIVES THE THE MILITARY COULD USE IT FOR CARRYING 
LOADS AND INCREASED ARMOUR THEY 
COULD USE IT ON THE BATTLEFIELDS 
THERE ARE STILL SEVERAL STUMBLING 
BLOCKS BUT THE U. S. MILITARY COULD 
DEPLOY ROBOTS IT'S BASED ON HIS 
PROTOTYPE WITHIN EIGHT YEARS THEY 
WON'T FLY OFF FIRE MISSILES AT 
DESIGNERS OR ALREADY IMAGINING 
FUTURE VERSIONS MORE REMINISCENT OF 
HOLLYWOOD LET'S GET AROUND A OF THE WEATHER 
IT'S A NICE TRADITIONAL WOOLLY 
VEST TO KEEP THE COLD OUT THAT YOU 
WILL NEED IT'S GOING TO TURN CHILE 
AGAIN THE WIND IS GOING TO GET 
STRONGER THAT IS THE BIG CHANGE 
COMING IN FROM THE EAST IT'S 
PARTICULARLY BY DAY THAT MOST OF US 
WILL NOTICE IT THERE ARE MORE 
SHOWERS TONIGHT COURTESY OF THE 
WIND ACROSS EAST ANGLIA TO THE 
NORTH OF THAT APACHE FROST ACROSS 
NORTHERN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND 
FURTHER SOUTH THE STRENGTH OF THE 
WIND ACTUALLY WILL MEAN THAT IT 
WILL STAY FROST FREE IT'S TOMORROW 
THAT THE WIND STARTS TO TAKE EFFECT 
IT STARTS OFF SOUTH EASTERLY BUT BY 
THE AFTERNOON THE BARROWS START 
COMING MORE DIRECTLY OF THE NORTH 
SEA THE NORTH SEA PARTICULARLY 
CHILLY AT THIS TIME OF YEAR ABOUT 
SIX DEGREES ON THE COASTS OF THE 
NORTH SEA IT WILL BE A RAW DAY NOT 
ABOUT LOOKING DAY ACROSS SCOTLAND 
QUITE PLEASANT IN THE WEST IF YOU 
CAN STAY OUT OF THE BREEZE NOT SO 
GREAT FOR THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND 
MORE CLOUD COMING IN THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON WITH OUTBREAKS OF RAIN 
INCREASING AMOUNTS OF CLOUD THROUGH 
THE DAY ACROSS EAST ANGLIA AS WELL 
SOUTHERN ENGLAND STILL SEEING 
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AND TEMPERATURES 
IN DOUBLE FIGURES LET ME DRAW YOUR 
ATTENTION TO THE WIND ARROWS COMING 
ACROSS FROM THE EAST IT IS ALSO 
PRETTY STRONG IN THE SUNSHINE IT 
WILL FEEL FRESHER ACROSS THE SOUTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND AND WALES FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND IT IS A DIFFERENT 
DAY MORE CLOUD AROUND TOMORROW AND 
WRITING LATER IN THE DAY MORE 
CLOUD AROUND ON FRIDAY WITH 
OUTBREAKS OF RAIN THAT WILL ADD TO 
THE COOL FEEL AN EASTERLY WIND IS 
POTENT LITTLE CHANGE FOR THE START 
OF THE WEEKEND BUT SOME BRIGHTER 
SPELLS LOOK THAT THEY MIGHT START 
TO PUSH THEIR WAY IN FROM THE NORTH 
ON SUNDAY A BRIGHTER ENTER THE 
WEEKEND FOR SCOTLAND NORTHERN
