THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE AND SOME SCENES OF A SEXUAL NATURE 
JOE HE WAS A YOUNG CORDWANGLER 
MONGING GREEBALS DID HE GO 
AND HE LOVED A BOGLER'S DAUGHTER 
BY THE NAME OF CHISWICK FLO 
VAIN SHE WAS AND LIKE A GRUSSET 
AND HER GANDER PARTS WERE FINE 
BUT SHE SNEERED AT HIS CORDWANGLE 
AS IT HUNG UPON THE LINE 
SO HE STOLE A WOGGLER'S MOULIE 
FOR TO MAKE A WEDDING RING 
BUT THE BOW STREET RUNNERS CAUGHT HIM 
AND THE JUDGE SAID YOU WILL SWING 
OH THEY HUNG HIM BY THE POSTERN 
NAILED HIS MOULIE TO THE FENCE 
FOR TO WARN ALL YOUNG CORDWANGLERS 
THAT IT WAS A GRAVE OFFENCE 
THERE'S A MORAL TO THIS STORY 
THOUGH YOUR CORDWANGLER BE POOR 
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF OTHERS' MOULIES 
FOR IT IS AGAINST THE LAW 
TWO WHIFFS OF THAT AND YOU'RE GREEDY

DIARIES ARE WRITTEN SO THAT ONE HAS A RECORD OF EVENTS

YOUR MAJESTY IS ANOINTED KING AT LAST 
ARTS THEATRE LONDON BERNARD SHAW'S SAINT JOAN 
MR. KENNETH WILLIAMS IS A BRILLIANTLY FUSSY DAUPHIN 
A SKINNY AND ABANDONED LAP DOG HE WILL GO FAR 
I'M IMPRESSED 
A CLASSICAL ACTOR 
GOOD BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED A LEGIT THESPIAN WITH NO FUNNY VOICES 
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN WE PRESENT HANCOCK'S HALF HOUR 
GOOD MORNING 
GOOD MORNING CHEEKY 
WANNA COME TO THE PICTURES WITH ME 
NO HOP IT HOP IT GO ON GET OUT OF IT GO ON GO ON 
DON'T BE LIKE THAT 
I SAW YOU WINK AT ME 
I DIDN'T WINK AT YOU ME FALSE EYELASH POPPED OUT 
OOOOO STOP MESSING ABOUT 
BUZZ OFF BUZZ OFF HOP IT I THINK YOU'RE SMASHIN' 
I'LL SMASH YOU IN A MINUTE 
OOH I LIKE GIRLS WITH A BIT OF SPIRIT 
WHERE'S MY BLEEDIN' SUPPER 
A DISASTER FEELS IMMINENT 
IT SEEMS AS IF THEIR WHOLE MARRIAGE IS CRACKING UP LIKE SOME JERRY BUILT HOUSE 
BUT THEN I CAN'T REMEMBER IT ANY OTHER WAY WHY DOES SHE STICK WITH HIM 
HE IS SO EMOTIONALLY INADEQUATE IN EVERY WAY 
HE STILL INSISTS ON THIS HEAVY HANDED COCK OF THE WALK STUFF 
WHICH IS HOT AIR AND SICKENING BECAUSE UNDERNEATH HE'S JUST LIKE ME 
ALWAYS VYING FOR HER AFFECTIONS 
WHEN WILL THE SCALES FALL FROM HIS EYES THE DAY I WAS BORN CHARLIE WASN'T NEEDED ANY MORE 
HE'D SERVED HIS PURPOSE 
LOUIE HAS ME NOW 
MANNERS 
PIG 
OH NO IT'S HIM AGAIN 
ONLY AT THIS JUNCTURE OF MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE CAN I STATE MY WORTH AS A HUMAN BEING 
BECAUSE I SEE THAT IN ART IS MAN'S STRIVING FOR THE TRUTH FOR ORDER 
FOR THE SENSE WHICH HAS EVADED HIM IN THE STUPIDITY OF EXISTENCE 
ONLY IN RECOGNITION OF THIS TRUTH IN ART CAN MY RESPECT BE COMMANDED 
HE HAD ME IN STITCHES 
OH LOOK AT THAT 
IT'S OUR NEW SEVENTEEN INCH CONSOLE MADAM 
I'D HAVE THOUGHT SEVENTEEN INCHES WOULD BE ENOUGH TO CONSOLE ANYONE 
WHAT'S GOING ON INSTALLING A TELEVISION SET WHAT TELEVISION SET 
I DIDN'T PURCHASE ANY TELEVISION 
YOU DIDN'T BUT KENNY DID IT'S A PRESENT 
A GIFT FROM ME TO MOTHER 
IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY 
MY KENNY CAN AFFORD IT 
IF I'M NOT SHARING WITH HER WHO AM I SHARING WITH 
GOOD EVENING 
WHAT DO YOU WANT I'M YOUR ROOM MATE OH NO YOU'RE NOT 
OH NO STOP MESSING ABOUT 
MM NICE ROOM ISN'T IT 
THE SHOW WENT VERY WELL TONIGHT TONY DON'T YOU THINK 
FOR SOME OF US IT DID THE AUDIENCE WERE WONDERFUL 
NOT BAD 
WHY THE FUNNY VOICES 
I BEG PARDON ALL THIS 
YOU HAVE FOUR VOICES YOUR SNIDE STOP MESSING ABOUT 
YOUR PLUMMY VOICE YOUR UPPER CLASS TWIT AND YOUR COCKNEY 
THAT'S ABOUT IT AIN'T IT 
A GREAT RANGE FOR A CLASSICAL ACTOR DON'T YOU THINK 
YES WELL THE AUDIENCE LOOK FORWARD TO MY VOICES DON'T THEY VERY POPULAR 
OF COURSE PLAYING TO THE GALLERY 
ANY CLOWN CAN DO THAT ANY CHEAP COMIC 
AUDIENCES NEED TO BE NOURISHED ON SOMETHING PURER KENNY 
AND WE HAVE TO TEACH THEM TAKE THEM TO A HIGHER PLAIN OF LAUGHTER 
THE COMIC POTENTIAL OF A MAN IS INFINITE KENNY 
INFINITE 
AND SO'S MY BUM HOLE TONY 
I THINK WHAT AN AUDIENCE WANTS IS TO BE BEGUILED 
AS SHAW ONCE SAID AND I HAVE APPEARED IN SHAW 
AN ACTOR MUST ILLUMINATE THE DARK CORNERS OF THE MIND 
I THINK IF YOU ENGAGE THEM THEY WILL ACCEPT IT TOTALLY WHATEVER THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU ARE PLAYING 
AFTER ALL COMEDY AND TRAGEDY ARE ONLY TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN 
HOWEVER BROAD THE PERFORMANCE MIGHT BE AN AUDIENCE WILL COME WITH YOU IF THEY BELIEVE YOU 
THEY'LL SAY IS IT ANY GOOD AND DO I BELIEVE IF NOT YOU'RE DEAD 
IT'S A TERRIBLE RISK YOU TAKE BEING A PERFORMER A TIGHTROPE WALK 
AND YOU TAKE THAT RISK NIGHTLY 
DON'T YOU AGREE TONY 
QUITE 
THE TOSSER 
I'LL HAVE YOUR MELON BALLS FOLLOWED BY THE CREAMED CHICKEN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
OH ISN'T HE NICE PETER 
REALLY NICE MANNER OH THANK YOU 
LOVELY BOY HE IS 
SAY HELLO TO THE AGENT DUCKIE 
DO YOU HAVE TO KENNETH 
HAVE TO WHAT PETER 
TALK SO LOUD THE WHOLE RESTAURANT CAN HEAR YOU CAN THEY 
OH WELL THEY SHOULDN'T BE LISTENING 
I EXPECT THEY PROBABLY RECOGNISE ME FROM APPEARING ON THE TELEVISION 
NOT FOR MUCH LONGER I'M AFRAID 
OH HOW DO YOU MEAN 
I'VE HAD A WORD FROM THE B. B. C. 
THEY WANT TO CUT BACK YOUR CHARACTERS 
HE SAYS YOU'RE A GROTESQUE 
A GROTESQUE WHO DID THE SLUR 
HANCOCK DID THEY WANT TO MAKE THE SHOW MORE REALISTIC LESS OF A CARTOON 
HE DOESN'T THINK YOU'RE NATURAL ENOUGH FOR HIS SHOW 
I SEE 
I'M SORRY 
WELL OF COURSE I'M NOT NATURAL 
I'M SUPERNATURAL I AM 
I AM 
I'M SURRE E. E. EAL PETER I AM 
I'M SURRE E. E. EAL 
THE LEAF THAT BLOSSOMS DIES AND FALLS FROM THE TREE IS IN THE FALLING TRAGIC 
BUT I AM THE LEAF THAT HAS NOT YET BLOSSOMED 
I AM THAT BLIGHTED LEAF 
MY TRAGEDY LIES IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY FAILURE TO BLOOM 
I COME ALWAYS NEAR 
BUT NEVER INTO TRUTH 
KENNY 
TELEPHONE CALL 
IT'S YOUR AGENT 
FUNNY HOW THINGS CAN CHANGE IN THE WINK OF AN EYE 
OH I SAY 
FANTABULOSA 
YOU SEEM TO COLLECT VOICES LIKE OTHERS COLLECT STAMPS 
DO YOU BORROW THEM FROM PEOPLE OR DO YOU JUST PLUCK THEM FROM THE AIR 
OH YES THEY ARE TAKEN FROM PEOPLE I HAVE KNOWN PINCHED I SUPPOSE 
THE SNIDE VOICE THE STOP MESSING ABOUT ONE WAS TAKEN FROM A BOY I MET A BOY WORKING AT THE MINT 
HE WAS DESCRIBING HOW YOU WERE SEARCHED TO MAKE SURE YOU HADN'T TAKEN ANYTHING THAT YOU SHOULDN'T 
AND HE WAS DESCRIBING WITH A PERPETUAL SMILE ON HIS FACE 
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE 
OTHERWISE THEY MAKE YOU TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF 
SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS A VERY GOOD IDEA THE VOICE I MEAN 
NOT HIM TAKING OFF HIS CLOTHES 
OF COURSE INDEED 
FOR ALL MY TALK ON TELEVISION I STILL HAVEN'T MATURED IN ANY REAL WAY 
SEXUALLY I'M AS JUVENILE AS EVER AND UNRESOLVED 
GIVEN A SIGN I WOULD ACT ON IT 
BUT NO SIGN EVER COMES 
THANK YOU FOR THE DRINK DON'T MENTION IT 
MY PLEASURE 
WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER ONE NO 
PEANUT 
PERHAPS LATER 
AFTERWARDS 
YES 
MIGHT I USE YOUR LAVATORY 
NOBODY IS EVER ALLOWED TO USE MY LAVATORY MY LAVATORY AND ITS PAPER ARE MY OWN OH 
HYGIENE 
WHEN DID YOU LAST SCRUB THOSE NAILS 
SORRY YOUR NAILS SUCH DIRT 
I DON'T REMEMBER NO WELL YOU SHOULD POSITIVELY FILTHY 
SHALL WE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE 
YES I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE 
I THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO MANIFEST THEIR LOVE FOR YOU PHYSICALLY 
WHEN THEY KNOW YOUR LACK OF RECIPROCATION ARE ABOMINABLY SELFISH 
ALL THIS TOUCHING AND KISSING WHICH SEEMS SO POPULAR AMONG OTHERS PASSES ME BY 
MY FRIENDS KNOW I'M A VIRGIN AND SAY I MAKE UP FOR IT BY FLIRTING 
TO THEM EVERYONE MUST DO SOMETHING OR DIE 
PERHAPS I AM DEAD ALREADY 
CELIBACY IS AN ESSENTIAL QUALITY IN MY OWN CHARACTER 
I MUST NEVER ALLOW MYSELF TO BE VULNERABLE IN THE SEXUAL SENSE 
THAT KIND OF HUMILIATION WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL IN EVERY WAY 
OH THE DIRT 
OBVIOUSLY THE SEX LIFE OF CONSENTING ADULTS OF THE SAME SEX HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYONE ELSE 
AND THE PRESENT LAW IS SO PRIMITIVELY BARBARIC 
THAT IT GIVES RISE TO MORE TROUBLE THAN IT'S WORTH 
I AM THE LEAF THAT HAS NOT BLOSSOMED 
PEOPLE USED TO SAY THAT MATCHES WERE MADE IN HEAVEN 
NOWADAYS THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE MADE BY COMPUTER AND A FIRM HAS RECENTLY OPENED 
CALLED BONA SOUL MATES WHO HAVE OFFERED TO DO IT ELECTRONICALLY 
AND I DECIDED TO PAY THEM A VISIT 
HELLO ANYBODY THERE 
OH HELLO I'M JULIAN AND THIS IS MY FRIEND SANDY 
OOH HELLO YES HELLO MR. HORNE 
WE'RE YOUR BONA SOUL MATES WE ARE 
YES OUR MOTTO IS FOR EVERY OMI THERE'S A POL POLONE 
WE GUARANTEE TO MATCH YOU WITH THE PERFECT PARTNER 
A SORT OF MARRIAGE BUREAU ARE YOU 
TO FIND YOU THE PERFECT PARTNER WE FILL IN YOUR PARTICULARS 
YES WE FILL 'EM IN YOU SEE 
WOULD YOU MIND ANSWERING A FEW QUESTIONS MR. HORNE I DON'T MIND 
THESE QUESTIONS ARE WORKED OUT BY A PSYCHIATRIST TO DETERMINE YOUR PERSONALITY 
FIRST OF ALL WHAT SORT OF CAR DO YOU DRIVE MR. HORNE WHY 
A CAR IS YOUR SORT OF VIRILITY SYMBOL 
THE SORT OF CAR YOU DRIVE INDICATES THE SORT OF PERSON YOU ARE 
SEAN CONNERY HE DRIVES A GREAT BIG POWERFUL SPORTS CAR VERY BUTCH VERY POTENT WHAT SORT DO YOU DRIVE 
A MINI 
I THINK THAT TELLS US ALL WE NEED TO KNOW MR. HORNE ALL WE NEED TO KNOW 
I GOT THE SEVENTY THREE UP TO THE ANGEL TODAY 
AND CALLED ON JOE ORTON PLAYWRIGHT AND HIS FRIEND 
IT WAS FRUGAL TO SAY THE LEAST 
WOULD YOU CARE FOR A HAM SANDWICH MR. WILLIAMS THANK YOU 
KEN MADE THEM ESPECIALLY 
I MAKE ALL THE FOOD AROUND HERE 
WHILE I WRITE PLAYS 
WHO DOES YOUR DECOR 
KEN DOES 
THEY'RE COLLAGES ART 
MM TWO ARTISTS UNDER THE SAME SMALL ROOF MUST CRAMP YOUR STYLE 
WE LIKE IT THIS WAY 
EVER SO COSY 
HAS BEEN FOR YEARS 
THIS HAM IS RATHER GOOD DON'T YOU THINK ISN'T IT 
I DO LOVE YOUR NEW PLAY JOE FUNERAL GAMES LOOT 
SORRY I'VE CHANGED THE TITLE 
I THINK UP ALL JOE'S TITLES 
IT'S VERY GOOD JOE 
OUTRAGEOUS MIND I'M FLATTERED 
HE IS OFTEN NOWADAYS BY ALL SORTS 
WHO'S YOUR FAVOURITE MR. WILLIAMS 
I PREFER MISS JULY 
I WOULD LIKE VERY MUCH TO HAVE BEEN BORN HANDSOME 
NOT FOR ITS OWN SAKE BUT FOR THE SAKE OF BEING ATTRACTIVE TO OTHERS 
I'VE NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS ONE SUPERFICIAL EXCUSE FOR MORE PROFOUND COMPLAINTS WITHIN 
SO MUCH IS BECAUSE I THINK MY FACE AND BODY UNPREPOSSESSING 
THIS IS OF COURSE THE PARADOX OF MY OWN NATURE 
THE THING THAT I AM BEING THE THING WHICH I DESPISE 
BUT I THINK MY DESPITE IS JUSTIFIED 
THIS ROMAN TUNIC I'M WEARING IN THE FILM 
IS REALLY QUITE SEXUAL DON'T YOU THINK JOAN 
VERY YOU KENNY 
HAIL CAESAR OH KENNY NOT AGAIN PUT IT AWAY 
FREAK 
I DIDN'T SEE A COCK THE WHOLE TIME I WAS IN LEICESTER 
REALLY NO EXCEPT MY OWN 
AND THAT GLIMPSED ONLY BRIEFLY IN A CRACKED MIRROR 
I'VE MADE A HABIT OF MY MIRROR MASTURBATION THE BARCLAY'S YES 
BARCLAY'S BARCLAY'S BANK 
WANK COCKNEY RHYME 
I SEE 
MENTAL COCK I LEAVE IT ALONE 
NOTHING CAN TOUCH MY FANTASIES 
POSITIVELY LE E. EWD AT TIMES IN MY MIND'S EYE 
WE'RE GOING TO MOROCCO FOR IT 
BUM 
TANGIER IS CERTAINLY THE PLACE FOR RELAXATION DURING A MILD WINTER 
YOU SHOULD COME I DON'T THINK YOUR KENNETH WOULD APPROVE DO YOU 
THE MORE THE MERRIER I SAY 
YES BUT DOES HE I'M OVER TWENTY ONE YOU KNOW 
ONLY IN A BAD LIGHT TODAY YOU COULD PLAY A BOY OF SWEET SIXTEEN 
GOOD 
OH YOU WANT LOCKING UP YOU DO 
I ALREADY HAVE BEEN KENNY HOW SHOCKING 
SHE WILL BE WITH HER PANTS DOWN AND HER TIE WRAPPED AROUND HER ANKLES 
I CAN'T SAY I APPROVE NOT MANY PEOPLE DO 
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE PROSPECT OF HAVING HIM ALL THE MORE ENTERTAINING 
IT'S IRRELIGIOUS AND IMMORAL 
LIKE MY PLAY HEH YES 
CERTAINLY AUDIENCES WILL BE MORTALLY OFFENDED SHOULD I APPEAR 
YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT THEN 
LOOT WENT DOWN AS I FEARED IT WOULD 
SHOCKED THE AUDIENCE TO BUGGERY 
JOE'S NOT HERE HE'S GONE OUT 
HIDING FROM ME IS HE 
WHEN DO YOU EXPECT HIM BACK 
DEPENDS ON WHAT HE FINDS MIGHT I COME IN 
I'M DOING HADDOCK FOR TEA LOVELY 
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH FOR THREE RUBBISH 
AFTER WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH IN THAT PLAY OF HIS I DESERVE FRESH SALMON 
THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU TODAY KENNETH 
JOE BOUGHT IT FOR ME HE SAID IT SUITED ME 
MORE VIRILE 
VERY DISTINGUISHED 
DO YOU LIKE IT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK 
HOLLANDAISE SAUCE JUST A SMIDGIN 
THE STOMACH'S PLAYING UP I COULD BLOW OFF LIKE THE WIND 
THANKS FOR SHARING THAT WITH ME PLEASURE 
JOE'S HAVING TROUBLE WITH HIS DICK 
HE WANTS A GOOD DOCTOR 
HIS HEART'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
SHAME HIS DICK ISN'T 
JOE TOLD ME 
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH TOGETHER HE SAID 
HOW VERY MAGNANIMOUS OF HIM 
I'D BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT 
GRATEFUL SOME KIND OF LOVE 
HE HAS AN INABILITY TO LOVE 
A HORROR OF INVOLVEMENT 
HE NEEDS TO BE UTTERLY FREE TO WRITE 
HE SAYS 
BUT YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT LOVE 
LOVE IS INVOLVEMENT 
WHEN I'M NOT INDULGED LOVED BY AN AUDIENCE 
I ALWAYS FEEL THE NEED TO RUN 
WHERE DO YOU RUN TO 
I'VE NO IDEA 
TO A FRIEND'S HABITAT I SUPPOSE 
SHARE A BIT OF HADDOCK EH BIT OF HADDOCK EH 
QUITE QUITE 
WHAT YOU NEED OUT OF LIFE KENNY IS A GOOD FUCK UP THE ARSE 
REALLY I SHOULD SAY SO WHY 
WOULD THAT HAVE HELPED ME TO PERFORM ANY BETTER IN YOUR PLAY IT MIGHT 
FARCE IS VERY CLOSE TO TRAGEDY 
IS THAT HOW YOU SEE ME 
A TRAGEDY NO 
DO YOU 
THAT FELLA'S GOT HIS EYE ON YOU 
WHERE OVER THERE 
NO I WON'T INDULGE JOE 
WHY NOT PROMISCUOUS SEX 
I'VE ALWAYS EQUATED IT WITH 
WHAT SIN 
BOLLOCKS 
I THINK THE NATURAL GOODNESS AND DIGNITY OF MAN IS BOUND UP WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN QUALITIES 
YOU SOUND LIKE THE OXFORD DICTIONARY 
AND IF YOU USE SOMEONE ELSE PHYSICALLY WITH NO OTHER MOTIVE 
BUT SEXUAL STIMULUS THEN YOU DEGRADE THEM 
YOU TAKE AWAY THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS AND DIGNITY AND OF COURSE YOUR OWN 
FILTH FIRES THE SOUL 
BEND OVER KENNY STRETCH YOUR TOES A LITTLE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE 
YOU PLAY AT YOUR GAMES JOE AND I'LL PLAY AT MINE 
WHAT DO WE ANY OF US HAVE BUT OUR ILLUSIONS 
AND WHAT DO WE ASK OF OTHERS BUT THAT WE BE ALLOWED TO KEEP THEM 
SOMERSET MAUGHAM 
IS THAT RIGHT YES IT'S ONE OF THE SECRETS OF CELIBACY 
THE PRESERVATION OF THE ILLUSION 
DON'T YOU THINK 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK 
NICE ARSE PERT AND JUICY 
JOE ORTON 
NIPPY INNIT 
I HOOVERED THE CARPET IN THE LOUNGE DRESSED ONLY IN BATHING TRUNKS

IN REALITY IT WAS A GOOD THING HIS DEATH PASS THE BUTTER 
HE'D NEVER HAVE RECOVERED WOULD HE LOUIE NO 
NOT AFTER SWALLOWING POISON 
ALMOST A VEGETABLE 
THE SHOW WENT VERY WELL TONIGHT DON'T YOU THINK AUDIENCE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF ME THEY LOVED YOU

LOTS OF PEOPLE ON ABOUT JOE'S DEATH 
EVERYONE PHONING AND ASKING THE SAME THING WHY 
I THINK THE MOTIVE WAS HALLIWELL LOVED JOE 
HALLIWELL FELT THAT SOMETHING VERY BIG AND IMPORTANT THREATENED THAT LOVE 
HE COULDN'T KILL THAT SO HE KILLED JOE ORTON 
THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES ANY SENSE 
IF THERE IS ANY SENSE IN MURDER 
THE WHOLE MESS THAT IS EXISTENCE AND MUNDANE THINGS IS SHOT THROUGH AND TRANSFORMED BY REDEMPTION 
THIS IS WHAT JESUS MEANT ABOUT REDEMPTION 
IT'S THE ONLY WAY ONE REAL ACT OF LOVE

ANYWAY TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT I TRIED SOMETHING NEW THIS MORNING 
PUT SOME FOOT POWDER UP THERE 
CAN'T DO ANY MORE HARM CAN IT 
LET'S SEE HOW THAT AFFECTS IT EH JOAN 
PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS 
THE REASON FOR MOST OF THE SMUT IN THIS WORLD IS BOREDOM ISN'T IT JOAN IS IT 
YES PEOPLE LIKE TO ATTRIBUTE IT TO REASONS MORE PROFOUND 
BUT IN MY OPINION IT'S PEOPLE'S CONCEIT THAT SEEKS PROFUNDITY IN REASONS FOR BEHAVIOUR ISN'T IT 
I WOULDN'T KNOW I'M NOT THAT BRIGHT 
BAD DAY WAS IT 
I ALWAYS HAVE A BAD DAY PERFORMING IN SUCH CRAPOLA 
WHEN I THINK OF THE SHAMELESS WAY I BEHAVE IN THESE STUDIOS 
THE DIRTY MIMES THE DIRTY SONGS THE OBSCENE DIALOGUE AND 
THE CROWDS THAT GATHER AROUND YOU LIKE A FAMILY 
MARRY ME JOAN 
WHAT THERE'LL BE NOTHING MESSY 
JUST FRIENDSHIP COMPANIONSHIP 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR MOTHER FOR THAT KENNY 
YES AND YOU BOTH GET ON DON'T YOU 
I NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT LOVEY 
WHAT ELSE IS THERE 
I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP HOPE YET YOU KNOW I'M ONLY FORTY THREE 
FORTY FIVE WHERE THERE'S LIFE THERE'S HOPE 
BESIDES IT WOULDN'T WORK OUT 
YOU'D NEVER BE ABLE TO ACCEPT MY TIGHTS DRIP DRYING IN YOUR SINK WOULD YOU 
I MIGHT YOU WOULDN'T 
YOU'D GROW TO HATE ME WITH ALL MY FEMALE PARAPHERNALIA ON SHOW 
PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT 
I KNOW I'M RIGHT 
I CAN READ YOU LIKE A BOOK KENNY 
A LOVE STORY AM I 
A LOVE STORY 
YOU'VE GOT A SPASTIC COLON 
YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE I'VE WON THE LOTTERY 
HE TOLD ME HE'D KEEP HIS EYE ON IT 
I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING ABOUT MY PREDICAMENTS 
HE SAID I SHOULD FIND A SUITABLE COMPANION TO SHARE MY LIFE WITH NOT TO WORRY 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TOO FAR MR. WILLIAMS A LITTLE SHARED MUTUAL MASTURBATION WON'T HURT YOU 
I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE DOCTOR GOOD 
MIND YOU BETTER TO FIND SOMEONE OLDER THAN YOURSELF NOT SOMEONE WHO'S AFTER YOUR MONEY 
QUITE 
CHARMING 
I SAT ALONE IN THE PARK THINKING OF LIKELY LOVERS 
BUT NOT A TYPE ENTERED MY HEAD 
LOVELY DAY FOR IT DON'T YOU THINK 
A WALK IN THE PARK 
OH LOVELY 
TRES ROMANTIC 
ALL THIS EXCREMENT 
IT'S A DISGRACE 
OH WHAT CAN YOU SAY AT THE END OF THE DAY 
WAS THE PLOT SO SOUND OR THE LINES PROFOUND 
WAS THERE RATHER LESS GRAIN THAN CHAFF 
OH WHAT CAN YOU SAY AT THE END OF THE DAY 
YOU CAN SAY YOU MADE THEM LAUGH 
THE ESSENCE OF BEING FUNNY IS CONFIDENCE A BUOYANCY 
MY ROLE IN LIFE IS PLAYED OUT TOTALLY WITHOUT CREDIBILITY 
AND SO OF COURSE ONE FALLS BACK ON PERSONALITY PLAYING 
AND ALL THE SAME OLD 
TIRED TRICKS 
THE PRESS CALL SEEMS TO BE GOING VERY WELL WE SEEM TO HAVE GOT AWAY WITH IT AGAIN' 
I PLAY THE PART OF THOMAS CROMWELL 
PRIVY SEAL TO KING HENRY THE EIGHTH AND PROTECTOR OF THE CROWN JEWELS 
MR. WILLIAMS COULD I HAVE ANOTHER WORD YOU MAY 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING CONTINUALLY APPEARING IN THESE SORT OF FILMS 
HAVING A BLOODY GOOD TIME DEAR 
I BEG PARDON 
WHY ARE YOU CONTINUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CHAMBER POT KIND OF COMEDY 
WELL IN OUR SOCIETY THERE WAS AND ALWAYS SHOULD BE ROOM FOR ALL KINDS OF ENTERTAINMENT 
IF IT WORKS ON ITS OWN LEVEL AND THAT THE ONLY CHARGE THAT WOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY US 
WOULD BE THAT THE COMEDY THE BURLESQUE IN THIS CASE DIDN'T WORK IT WASN'T FUNNY DON'T YOU THINK 
INDUBITABLY KENNY BUT THAT'S MY POINT 
IS YOUR KIND OF COMEDY STILL FUNNY 
I SOMETIMES FEEL I AM SO USELESS 
I'M SLOWLY SPLINTERING AS A PERSONALITY 
FEEL AS THOUGH I'M STUCK TOGETHER WITH STAMP PAPER 
KENNETH IT'S YOUR TURN TO BEGIN THE SUBJECT STIFF UPPER LIP 
YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS AS USUAL AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW 
I HAVE ACTUALLY TRIED THIS MYSELF AT HOME AND ONE EVIDENTLY COMES TO RESEMBLE A VENTRILOQUIST'S DUMMY 
UNDERNEATH THE LAMPLIGHT 
BENEATH THE BARRACK DOOR 
KENNETH YOU'VE BEEN CHALLENGED WHO CHALLENGED ME 
CLEMENT FREUD BUT I HAVEN'T FINISHED YOU GREAT NIT 
I'M SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS IT YOU GREAT FOOL INTERRUPTING ME BEFORE I'VE EVEN STARTED 
OH DEAR I THINK MY STAR IS ON THE WANE WHILE ALL AROUND ME THE RUBBISH PROLIFERATES' 
WHO LET THIS TAT IN HERE KENNETH 
THE CARRY ONS USED TO BE MY MAINSTAY 
AS LONG AS THEY WERE THERE I NEVER HAD TO WORRY 
HEY HO 
I FELL TO MUSING ON MY CONDITION 
I CAN'T HAVE SEX COS I JUST CAN'T COPE ON THAT LEVEL 
AND SO I'M ONLY REALLY LEFT WITH WORK 
WHO IS IT PETER DO YOU WANT TO GO ON THE TELEVISION AND CHAT WITH MICHAEL PARKINSON 
CERTAINLY NOT NORTH COUNTRY NIT 
VOCAL INTRO 
OH HONEY PICTURE ME 
UPON YOUR KNEE 
WITH TEA FOR TWO 
AND TWO FOR TEA 
THERE IS THE ENDLESS QUESTION WILL I REMAIN SOLVENT 
WILL I LAST OUT UNTIL I AM ABLE TO RETIRE 
MY WHOLE LIFE IS TRYING TO MAKE IT UP TO HER 
TRYING TO ERASE ALL THE SADNESS AND THE LONELINESS AND ONLY SUCCEEDING IN MAKING MORE LONELINESS 
COS THE NIGHTS I DON'T SPEND WITH HER SERVE TO EMPHASISE THE OTHERS OR VICE VERSA 
THERE'S NOBODY IN THE WORLD LIKE MY KENNY 
AWFUL DREAMS OF LOUIE SAYING GOODBYE FOREVER 
AND START TO BAKE A SUGAR CAKE 
WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT YOU 
FOR YOU TO TAKE FOR ALL THE BOYS TO SEE 
PETER EADE'S SECRETARY RANG 
THAMES TELEVISION MAVIS NICHOLSON CHAT SHOW WILL RAISE THE FEE TO ONE HUNDRED 
I SAID 
OH ALL RIGHT 
BUT THIS IS A PYRRHIC VICTORY 
IT'S A COMFORT TO ME KENNETH WILLIAMS TO LEARN THAT YOU ALWAYS KEEP A DIARY OH YES 
WHAT'S THE SADDEST THING WHEN YOU READ THEM THAT YOU FIND IN YOUR DIARY 
THAT CONTINUALLY OCCURS IN MINE IS DEPRESSION LIKE SAYING YOU'D WANT TO KILL YOURSELF OR SOMETHING 
OH YES I OFTEN PUT DOWN STUFF ABOUT SUICIDE 
HOW WOULD ONE GO ABOUT IT 
AND WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST METHOD 
ALL THAT KIND OF THING YOU KNOW 
LOOKING BACK IT'S OFTEN YOU KNOW 
QUITE AMUSING WHY DO YOU THINK YOU'D WANT TO KILL YOURSELF 
WELL ONE WOULD THINK IT AT THE TIME BECAUSE OF AN EXTREMELY LOW STATE 
OF MORALE AND SO ONE DOES ACTUALLY WRITE SOMETHING DOWN ABOUT WHAT'S PRACTICAL 
IN TERMS OF HOW ONE SHOULD GO ABOUT IT 
AFTER ALL ONE TRIES TO REMAIN CHEERFUL 
DOESN'T ONE 
HE'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS EVERYTHING FROM AN ANGRY DOWAGER TO A WASP WITH ADENOIDS 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE ONE AND ONLY MR. KENNETH WILLIAMS 
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS STINKING ROTTEN PLAY IN THE FIRST PLACE 
I'M SICK TO DEATH OF YOUR COMPLAINTS KENNETH 
YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PRODUCTION YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT THE CAST YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT THE LINES 
YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT EVERY BLOODY THING 
WHEN YOU'RE IN A LONG RUN PETER 
THE PLAY LIVES WITH YOU DAY AND NIGHT 
AND IF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH YOU PERFORM 
ARE CONTINUALLY FRUSTRATING THEN IT ENDS IN DRIVING YOU TO DEMENTIA 
AND A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN 
HAVE YOU SEEN THE LARRY GRAYSON SHOW 
NO A COMPLETE CRIB OF YOUR ACT 
REALLY AND JOHN INMAN IS DOING THE SAME THING ON THE B. B. C. 
THEY'RE FINDING OTHER PEOPLE TO DO WHAT YOU DO KENNETH 
AND CHEAPER IN EVERY SENSE 
NEVERTHELESS YOU MUST REALISE YOU'RE NOT AS UNIQUE AS YOU ONCE WERE 
THE PROBLEM IS KENNETH 
IT'S GOT ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO FIT YOU INTO A COMPANY 
PEOPLE FIND YOU A BIT OF A PROBLEM YOUR PECULIAR WAYS 
OH THE PENNY HAS FINALLY DROPPED FOR THEM HAS IT 
I'VE NEVER BLOODY FITTED IN PETER HAVE I 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN BLOODY PECULIAR 
STRUNG OUT ON A LIMB 
THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME SO GROTESQUE 
I FEEL QUITE PEACEFUL AND UNWORRIED 
IT IS ODD ONE MINUTE I'M THINKING I'LL NEVER ACT AGAIN AND THEN I DON'T BOTHER ABOUT IT AT ALL 
TOMORROW A VOICEOVER FOR UNIGATE MILK 
I'VE HAD A TERRIBLE SHOCK 
I JUST MET LOUIE IN THE STREET AND SHE SAID SCUSE ME I KNOW YOUR FACE WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
SHE DIDN'T RECOGNISE ME 
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME

BUT I'M DROWNING 
MY WHOLE CAREER HAS BEEN THE WAVING 
I'M A CULT I AM I'M A CULT 
I'VE BEEN EATING AT MYSELF FOR YEARS JUST LIVING OFF BODY FAT 
AND PEOPLE SAY ALL HE DOES NOW IS GO ON AND TELL THOSE OLD STORIES WE'VE ALL HEARD BEFORE 
WITH HIS USUAL LAVATORY GAGS AND CAMP BLETHER PATHETIC 
THE FEELING IS OF A CLAMP UNDER THE HEART AND THERE IS SWEATING 
AND THEY'VE OPENED ANOTHER LESBIAN RESTAURANT 
LEBANESE

EVERYBODY'S AT IT 
LEBANESE YOU SILLY COW

WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE WHEN I'M GONE DEAD 
BLOO IS THE COLOUR BLOO IS THE NAME 
YOU KNOW I CARE FOR YOU DON'T YOU LOU 
AS I CARE FOR NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD 
PASS THE BUTTER 
THAT'S THE REASON I'M TOTALLY UNINHIBITED WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU 
I CAN SAY WHAT I LIKE 
I CAN BE MYSELF WITH YOU 
ALMOST 
BLOO IS THE COLOUR 
BLOO IS THE NAME 
YOU'VE NEVER GIVEN ME A KISS 
YOU'VE NEVER COME UP TO THE GUARDROOM WHERE I SLEEP 
I'M AFRAID THE GASTROSCOPY SHOWS THERE IS AN ULCER 
A HUGE ULCER IN THE SAME PLACE 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DECIDE IS WHETHER YOU CAN GO ON TAKING THE PILLS OR HAVE THE OPERATION 
OPERATION 
YES YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER HAVING THE OPERATION IS IMPORTANT 
THE TIMING OF THE OPERATION IS CRUCIAL 
AFTER ALL YOU'RE NO SPRING CHICKEN
