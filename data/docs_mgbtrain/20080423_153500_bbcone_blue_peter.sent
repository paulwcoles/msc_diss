ON TODAY'S BLUE PETER I GET IN A 
BIT OF A SPIN AND I TAKE SKIPPING TO THE EXTREME 
HELLO IF YOU THOUGHT THAT SKIPPING 
WAS JUST FOR THE PLAYGROUND THEN 
THINK AGAIN CHECK OUT THE BLUE AND 
WHITE ROPE SKIPPERS 
THAT WAS BRILLIANT THESE GUYS WILL 
BE TEACHING ME SOME SKIPPING STANCE 
LATER 
AND AS WELL AS THAT THERE'S ALSO A 
SPECIAL SPEEDY SKIPPING CHALLENGE 
FOR GETHIN LATER ON IN THE SHOW 
IT WILL BE TRICKY GOOD LUCK WITH 
THAT IN AN EMERGENCY POLICE 
DRIVERS ARE ALLOWED TO DRIVE FASTER 
THAN A ANYBODY ELSE ON THE ROAD 
BUT ONLY IF THEY HAVE PASSED THEIR 
SPECIAL ADVANCED POLICE DRIVING 
TEST 
WE HAVE ALL SEEN AND HEARD POLICE 
CARS ON THE WAY TO AN EMERGENCY TO 
RESPOND QUICKLY ALL POLICE DRIVERS 
MUST UNDERGO EXTENSIVE TRAINING MY 
CHALLENGE WOULD BE SPLIT INTO TWO 
DRIVING TASKS ONE ABOUT 
OBSERVATION AND THE OTHER ABOUT 
CONTROL I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR HOW 
FAST MIND STRUCTURE WOULD BE 
PUTTING MEAT TO THE TEST 
OBSERVATION IS ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT TESTS TELL ME WHAT 
HAPPENED ON THE FIRST LOCATION THE 
SECOND OCCASION YOU CAUGHT THE BALL 
I WAS AWARE 
IF WE LOOK AT OUR OBSERVATION OF 
THE BALL WE ARE ANTICIPATING IT 
COMING TOWARDS YOU THAT IS EXACTLY 
WHAT WE APPLY ON THE ROAD 
DAMIEN WAS GOING TO DEMONSTRATE TO 
ME MY FIRST TASK TALKING ABOUT 
POSSIBLE DANGERS I COULD SEE WHILE 
DRIVING DRIVING IRON GREY TO ASK YOU TO ENGAGE IN 
SOME COMMENTARY THAT DOES ENHANCE 
OBSERVATION AND PLANNING SKILLS ON 
THE SIMULATED EMERGENCY CALL 
EXERCISE YOU HAVE GOT ONE A 
VEHICLE TWO VEHICLES TOWARDS US 
GOOD REACTION FROM OF THE BLUE 
FOCUS I AM CONSTANTLY ASKING 
MYSELF QUESTIONS L. WILL ALWAYS 
EXERCISE RESTRAINT AND SLOW DOWN IF 
I CANNOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS LOOK 
OUT FOR CHILDREN IT IS A 
RESIDENTIAL AREA L. AM THINKING 
ABOUT PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS 
I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW MUCH SHE WAS 
NOTICING AND HOW MANY POTENTIAL 
HAZARDS THERE WERE L. ARRIVED BACK 
AT THE DRIVING SCHOOL COMPLETELY 
STUNNED STUNNED I DO NOT KNOW IF I COULD DO IT L. 
THINK I WAS TOO PANICKED BY 
WATCHING EVERYBODY ELSE IS THAT 
PEDESTRIAN KITE TO STOP HAVE THEIR 
HAIR DOES IS THAT CAR GOING TO 
PALL OVER MY MIND WENT A BIT CRAZY 
TO PULL OVER THAT WAS NOT THE 
ONLY PART TO MY CHALLENGE THIS IS 
KNOWN AS ACE GATE PAN ON IT IS NINETY 
LITRES OF OIL AND A CONSTANT SUPPLY 
OF WATER SKATE PAN AS 
SECOND PART OF MY CHALLENGE I HAVE 
TO PROVE THAT I CAN DRIVE MY 
VEHICLE SAFELY I HAVE A FEELING IT 
COULD BE POTENTIALLY VERY SLIPPY 
IF I ACCELERATE QUITE HARSHLY ON A 
SLIPPERY SURFACE I AM GOING TO 
SPAIN IF YOU DO SKID RECOGNISE IT 
EARLIER AND REMOVE THE SOURCE OF 
THAT SPAIN 
I HAD TO KEEP MY EYES PEELED AS I 
PRACTISE MY OBSERVATION EXERCISE L. 
QUICKLY GOT INTO TROUBLE WITH 
DAMIEN DAMIEN I NOTICED THAT YOU'RE VERY CLOSE ON 
THAT CAR STOP IN THE NORMAL 
POSITION YOU WOULD STOP 
WHEN YOU STOP YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO 
SEE THE WHEELS OF THE CAR IN FRONT 
I AM LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD BUT I 
CANNOT GUIDE TO GO STRAIGHT AHEAD 
WHAT AMBULANCE WHERE IS IT AFTER 
A BAD START I BEGAN TO FOCUS AND 
SETTLED MORE INTO THE EXERCISE 
APPROACHED THE ROUNDABOUT WITH 
CAUTION TRAFFIC COMING IN THE 
OPPOSITE DIRECTION 
GO TO YOUR RIGHT NICE AND EARLIER 
BY EARLIER OBSERVATION YOU CAN MAKE 
AT GOOD DECISION 
WE WERE SOON BACK AT THE DRIVING 
SCHOOL IT IS DIFFICULT TO TALK 
ABOUT EVERYTHING WHILE DRIVING BUT 
IT REALLY WORKS NOW I AM JUST A 
NERVOUS ABOUT MY ASSESSED DRIED OUT 
AND HOW I WILL BE ABLE TO COPE 
WITHOUT ANY INSTRUCTION STILL TO 
COME WILL I BE ABLE TO GET MY EYES 
AND BRAIN INTO GEAR OR WELL MY 
DREAMS OF PASSING THIS CHALLENGE 
SKIDDING TO A HALT 
I AM GOING TO LEARN SOME SKIPPING 
MOVES NOW FROM RACHEL AND BECKY 
YOU TAKE SKIPPING VERY SERIOUSLY 
DON'T YOU 
WE DO WE TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD 
DOING ROPE SKIPPING AND DID 
DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE U. K. WE ARE 
THE ONLY TEAM TO REPRESENT THE U. K.

CROSS YOUR ARMS PUT YOUR HAND 
ULSTER WOULD YOUR POCKET HANDLES 
TO JUMP ACROSS BRING THE ROPE WILL 
BE AHEAD CROSS YOUR ARMS 
JUMPER CROSS THROUGH THE LOOP AND 
JUMP 
I HONESTLY HAVE NEVER DONE THAT 
BEFORE I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT 
AGAIN SHOW ME ANOTHER ONE 
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT HARDER 
THAT IS A BIT HARDER 
DROP YOUR RIGHT ARM BETWEEN YOUR 
LEGS INTO YOUR KNEE HOLD YOUR ARMS 
UP AND YOU CAN START SKIPPING LIKE 
THAT NOW YOU CAN

GAFFIN WILL BE DOING HIS SKIPPING 
TALENT AT THE END OF THE SHOW NOW 
IT IS THE A Z. OF WEIRD ANIMALS

LIZARD CAN BE FOUND IN THE 
UNDERGROWTH OF COUNTRIES ACROSS 
EUROPE OUR RESIDENT WEIRD ANIMAL 
EXPERT NICK BAKER IS WITH US NOW

CAN SEE JUST HOW MUCH LIKE A SNAKE 
HE LOOKS AND AT THE SAME TIME I 
WILL SHOW YOU WHY HE IS NOT A SNAKE 
SLOW WORMS WE GET THEM IN THE U. K. 
THEY ARE ALSO LEGLESS LIZARDS IT 
SEEMS THAT SOME LIZARDS HAVE 
DECIDED DURING THEIR EVOLUTION THAT 
LEG IS JUST GETTING THE WAY THEY 
LIKE TO MOVE AROUND IN DENSE 
UNDERGROWTH THEY CAN SLIP THROUGH 
THE SOIL DOWN BURROWS 
THEY DON'T 
NEED LEGS THE EXACTLY 
THAT IS 
WHAT HE DOES BUT YOU CAN TELL YOU 
ARE NOT DEALING WITH A SNAKE HERE 
IF YOU STARE AT HIM IN THE FACE 
EVENTUALLY YOU WILL SEE HE WILL 
BLINK IF IT BLINKS YOU KNOW YOU 
HAVE GOT A LIZARD NOT A SNAKE 
THESE GUYS ALSO HAVE GOT ANY A 
WHOLE A SNAKE DOES NOT HAVE THAT 
EITHER SO BASICALLY IT IS JUST A 
LONG LIZARD 
I BELIEVE YOU IT IS 
NOT A SNAKE WHAT THEY NEED TO DO 
NOW IS TO PUT THAT ON THE WALL OF 
WEIRD OVER HERE APART FROM THE 
FACT THAT I CANNOT ACTUALLY 
PRONOUNCE ITS NAME IT DOES NOT 
SEEM TO HAVE A YELLOW BELLY AND IT 
IS LEGLESS SO I AM THINKING LET'S
