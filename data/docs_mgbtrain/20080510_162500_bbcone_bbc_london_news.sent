RUMBLE AWAY THROUGH THE NIGHT A 
STICKY NIGHT FOR SOME NO LOWER

NORTHERN IRELAND MANAGING TWENTY ONE FOR 
BELFAST A FEW SHOWERS OVER WESTERN 
SCOTLAND NOTICE LOW CLOUD FROM 
ABERDEENSHIRE TO THE BORDERS 
KEEPING TEMPERATURES COOLER FOR 
EDINBURGH AND ABERDEEN NORTHERN 
ENGLAND LOOKING FINE ONE OR TWO
