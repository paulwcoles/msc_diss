THIS STRETCH OF COAST HAS SEEN REPEATED WAVES OF TRIBAL SETTLERS 
THAT HAVE HELPED FORGE OUR NATIONAL IDENTITY 
SAXONS JUTES VIKINGS DANES 
THEY ALL CAME HERE YOU KNOW 
AND THEY WERE SO IMPRESSED THEY ALL DECIDED TO STAY 
BUT OUR ANCESTORS NEVER GOT ROUND TO COLONISING THIS HEADLAND 
UNTIL RECENTLY IT WAS MOSTLY A MARSH 
BUT NOW IT'S FELIXSTOWE 
THE U. K.'S LARGEST CONTAINER PORT 
I'M GOING TO SEE WHAT ONE OF THOSE IS ALL ABOUT 
NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF THE GOODS WE CONSUME ON OUR ISLAND ARRIVE HERE BY SEA 
WHEN YOU'RE SHOPPING IT'S ODDS ON YOU'RE BUYING STUFF 
THAT CAME HERE BY SHIP IN BOXES LIKE THESE 
IN ALL FORTY PER CENT OF BRITAIN'S TRADE COMES THROUGH THIS PORT 
MUCH OF THAT TRADE ONCE FLOWED THROUGH LONDON 
BUT IT MOVED HERE BECAUSE FELIXSTOWE CAN TAKE BIGGER SHIPS 
THESE CONTAINERS COME FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD 
THERE ARE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND OF THEM ON THAT SHIP ALONE 
AND ON THE BIGGEST VESSELS THERE ARE UP TO TEN THOUSAND CONTAINERS 
EACH CRANE MUST UNLOAD A BOX EVERY MINUTE DAY AND NIGHT 
FELIXSTOWE HANDLES NEARLY TWO MILLION CONTAINERS PER YEAR 
SOME OF THE CONTENTS AREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY APPEAR 
STOPPING SMUGGLERS USING ANY ONE OF THESE INCOMING BOXES IS A HERCULEAN TASK 
HOW ON EARTH DO THEY DO IT 
HI KEVIN 
KEVIN SAYER'S ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WITH THE POWER TO OPEN ANY BOX 
OUR FIRST CONTAINER HAS COME FROM AFRICA 
IT'S SUSPICIOUS BUT THEY WON'T SAY WHY 
IS THAT TYPICAL THAT LOAD THERE 
BECAUSE IT LOOKS SO COMPLETELY HARMLESS 
YEAH INDEED 
VERY OFTEN THAT'S WHAT THE CRIMINALS AND SMUGGLERS ARE TRADING ON 
THEY WANT THEIR CONSIGNMENT TO LOOK AS LEGITIMATE AS POSSIBLE 
SO IT EVADES OUR CONTROLS 
IT DOES SEEM A BIT ODD THAT IT'S ONLY HALF FULL 
KEVIN DO YOU WANT TO COME HAVE A LOOK AT THIS O. K. 
THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE THE X. RAY SHOWS A DARK BLOCK WITHIN THE IMAGE 
IT'S A BLACK BIN LINER KEVIN 
ABSOLUTELY 
IT'S COMING OUT IT'S COMING OUT 
IT SOUNDS HEAVY 
IT MADE A SORT OF A THUD THERE 
YEAH MAYBE IT'S JUST THE LATEST WILBUR SMITH 
A BIN LINER WITHIN A BIN LINER 
OH THAT EVEN LOOKS SUSPICIOUS TO ME 
THIS LOOKS LIKE CANNABIS RESIN 
THAT LOOKS LIKE CANNABIS LOOK AT THAT 
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT YOU'VE SET THIS UP HAVEN'T YOU 
YOU'VE DONE THIS FOR ME 
I WISH WE COULD HAVE ARRANGED IT SO WELL 
IS THE WHOLE CARGO NOW OFFICIALLY DODGY GEAR 
THE WHOLE CARGO WILL WILL EFFECTIVELY BE FORFEIT 
WE USE A HISTORIC PHRASE FORFEIT TO THE CROWN 
WHAT'S THE QUEEN GOING TO DO WITH THAT 
AH WELL WE WORK ON BEHALF OF THE QUEEN IT NOW BECOMES HER PROPERTY 
I'M GONNA GO AWAY FROM THIS WITH A VERY SKEWED IDEA OF YOUR JOB 
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE THIS STUFF'S POPPING OUT OF EVERY CASE IT'S SO EASY 
IT TURNED OUT THAT OUR VERY FIRST CONTAINER ACTUALLY HAD COCAINE IN IT 
STREET VALUE EIGHTY THOUSAND 
AND THAT'S JUST A DROP IN THE OCEAN 
LAST YEAR CUSTOMS SEIZED FORTY NINE TONNES OF THE STUFF AT OUT FRONTIERS
