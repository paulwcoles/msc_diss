GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO MONDAY'S 
WORKING LUNCH I'M NIK WOOD THE 
AXING OF THE TEN PER CENT TAX BAND ATTRACTS 
MORE CRITICISM THE TREASURY 
SELECT COMMITTEE SAYS THOSE THAT 
WILL LOSE OUT ARE AN UNREASONABLE 
TARGET TARGET H. S. B. C. HAVE LOST A DISK CONTAINING 
THE DETAILS OF THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS 
B. A. PILOTS BRAND THE COMPANY A 
LAUGHING STOCK AND I'LL BE ASKING 
SOME OF OUR REGULAR GUESTS JUST 
WHERE THEY THINK THE F. T. S. E. IS 
HEADING HEADING COMING UP 
TALKING THE LANGUAGE OF BUSINESS IN 
WALES WALES WELCOME TO CARDIFF 
SPEAKING IN WELSH 
IS BEING BILINGUAL GOOD FOR 
BUSINESS I HAVE COME TO WALES TO 
FIND OUT 
AND WE'LL BE TALKING TO 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL UNION 
OF STUDENTS TO FIND OUT WHY THEY'RE 
ENDING THEIR OPPOSITION TO TUITION 
FEES LET'S GO FIRST OF ALL TO THE 
MARKETS NOW AND AS I WAS JUST 
SAYING THE BANKING GROUP H. S. B. C. HAS 
TODAY FACED THE PROSPECT OF AN 
INVESTIGATION BY THE CITY WATCHDOG 
AFTER ADMITTING IT HAD LOST A DISK 
CONTAINING THE DETAILS OF THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND 
CUSTOMERS THE DISK WENT MISSING 
AROUND A WHILE AGO NOW FOUR 
WEEKS AGO AFTER BEING SENT FROM 
THE GROUP'S OFFICE IN SOUTHAMPTON 
TO REINSUREER WITH AN EXTERNAL 
COURIER ANOTHER FIRST TIME NOT 
THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT 
THIS SORT OF THING HAPPENING 
RECENTLY IT CONTAINED THE NAMES 
AND BIRTH DATES OF PEOPLE WITH LIFE 
INSURANCE AT THE BANK THEY 
GENERALLY WILL THE LIFE INSURANCE 
LINKED TO A MORTGAGE 
QUITE A BIT OF STRENGTH COMING 
THROUGH INTO SOME OF THOSE BANKING 
SHARES ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND IS 
SET TO ANNOUNCE THE THIRD TIER OF 
JOB CUTS IN RELATION TO ITS 
TAKEOVER OF THE DUTCH BANK A. B. N. AMRO 
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AS WELL 
SO QUITE A LOT OF STUFF COMING 
THROUGH THERE HBOS DOWN TWO PER CENT AT 
FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO POINT FIVE LOOKING AROUND SOME OF THE 
MORE WIDELY HELD SHARES JUST LIKE 
THE BANKING SECTOR WAS BEING PULLED 
IN TWO DIRECTIONS THE MORE POPULAR 
SHARES ARE PULLED IN TWO DIFFERENT 
DIRECTIONS B. A. THOUGH IT'S UP FOUR 
THE AIRLINE PILOTS' UNION BALPA 
SAYS THE BRAND HAS BECOME IN THEIR 
WORDS A LAUGHING STOCK AND HAS 
URGED A CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT STYLE 
IT SAYS RECENT PROBLEMS AT TERMINAL 
FIVE WHERE BAGGAGE PROBLEMS CAUSED 
FLIGHTS TO BE CANCELLED THEY SAID 
WERE SYMPTOMATIC OF PROBLEMS AT B. A. 
NONETHELESS SHARES ARE UP TODAY 
WELL THERE IS ALSO TALK THAT 
EUROPEAN UTILITIES E. D. F. AND R. W. E. HAVE 
APPROACHED CENTRICA ABOUT A 
POSSIBLE JOINT BID FOR THE NUCLEAR 
POWER OPERATOR BRITISH ENERGY 
BRITISH ENERGY SHARES ARE UP TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT 
CENTRICA IS UP TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT THERE AS 
EXPECTED WE HAVE HAD NEWS FROM 
EASYJET REPORTED REALLY A STONKING 
RISE IN THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS 
CARRIED UP TWO HUNDRED FIVE PER CENT IN MARCH THAT 
WAS COMPARED WITH MARCH THE YEAR 
BEFORE TO ABOVE THIRTY SEVEN MILLION 
HOWEVER IT FLATTERS THOSE FIGURES 
BECAUSE IT FOLLOWS THE ACQUISITION 
OF G. B. AIRWAYS YOU WOULD EXPECT 
THEM TO BE CARRYING MORE PEOPLE 
HOWEVER VERY IMPORTANTLY THEY ARE 
FLYING THEIR PLANES MUCH FULLER 
NOT GREAT FOR THE PASSENGERS 
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE PEOPLE ON THE 
PLANES BUT VERY GOOD FOR THE 
BUSINESS THERE ALSO RECRUITMENT 
CONSULTANT MICHAEL PAGE RECORDED 
RECORD GROSS PROFITS HOWEVER IT 
WARNED OF CAUTIONARY AREAS GROUP 
PROFITS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER ROSE 
THIRTY THREE PER CENT THEIR SHARES DESPITE ALL OF 
THAT ARE DOWN L. EXPECT THAT'S 
BECAUSE NOT THAT THEY HAVE DONE 
VERY WELL RECENTLY BUT BECAUSE 
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE 
ELSEWHERE I WANT TO POINT OUT 
MINING IS VERY STRONG TODAY AS YOU 
CAN SEE ONLY TWO OF THOSE NOT 
MOVING NONE OF THEM ARE DOWN THE 
F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IT'S UP THIRTY TWO POINTS FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
FLIRTING WITH THE SIX THOUSAND LEVEL THERE 
ALSO DISK WENT MISSING AROUND FOUR 
WEEKS AGO AFTER BEING SENT FROM THE 
GROUP'S OFFICES IN SOUTHAMPTON HE 
SAYS THEY HAVE HAD A DOCUMENT 
RECOMMENDING THEY ACCEPT A CASH 
OPTION FOR SHARES HE SAYS WHAT 
HAPPENS IF WE DON'T RETURN THE FORM 
OF ACCEPTANCE L. HAVE BEEN ASKED 
THIS QUESTION BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
IN THE PAST PEOPLE WHO HOLD SHARES 
IN A COMPANY THEY DON'T WANT IT TO 
BE TAKEN OVER OR INDEED AFTER A 
COMPANY HAS BEEN BOUGHT SAYS YOU 
CAN'T HAVE MY SHARE CERTIFICATE L. 
AM CHUCKING IT UNDER THE BED AND 
THEY HOLD ON TO THEIR CERTIFICATE 
IN GENERAL UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU 
THINGS MOVE ON WITHOUT YOU 
ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE YOU SHOULD 
ALWAYS ASK THE COMPANY ITSELF 
BECAUSE IN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES 
IT MAY CHANGE THE VOTE WILL TAKE 
PLACE AND IF THE MAJORITY OF THE 
SHARES AGREE TO A TAKEOVER THEN IT 
JUST GOES AHEAD IF YOU NEVER 
RESPOND TO THE LETTERS YOU GET 
THEY'LL HOLD THE MONEY YOU WERE DUE 
TO GET SORT OF ON YOUR BEHALF 
COMPANIES REALLY DON'T LIKE HOLDING 
THIS MONEY DESPITE THE FACT THAT 
THEY COULD EARN INTEREST ON IT BUT 
IT ACCRUES TO YOU ANYWAY IN THE END 
THEY DON'T LIKE IT BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE TO HOLD ON TO A LOT OF CASH 
FOR SMALL SHAREHOLDERS 
ADMINISTRATIVELY THAT'S EXPENSIVE 
IN THE END FOR ANYONE IN THIS 
POSITION THE TRUTH IS YOU CAN'T 
STOP THE ROLLER COASTER THAT IS A 
BIG COMPANY TAKEOVER 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE REST OF 
THE BUSINESS NEWS THE TREASURY 
COULD HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THE 
IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL 
UNCERTAINTY IN A REPORT ON THE 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BUDGET THE TREASURY SELECT 
COMMITTEE SAYS THE TREASURY NOW 
FACES A MAJOR CHALLENGE IN MEETING 
ITS OWN TARGETS EVIDENCE SUGGESTS 
THAT IT'S FORECASTS REMAIN 
OPTIMISTIC DESPITE NEW ESTIMATES TO 
THE CONTRARY ACCORDING TO THE 
REPORT WE'LL BE HEARING MORE FROM 
THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE LATER 
IN THIS PROGRAMME 
SEVENTEEN STAFF HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED AT 
UTILITY FORM NPOWER OVER 
ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THE SALES TACTICS 
BEING USED THE SUNDAY TIMES 
CLAIMED SOME SALES STAFF MISLED 
POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS THE COMPANY 
SAYS IT'S SUSPENDED A SALES TEAM 
AND LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION BY A 
SEPARATE DEPARTMENT INTO THE 
NEWSPAPER'S CLAIMS 
THE COST OF SENDING A LETTER HAS 
GONE UP FROM TODAY ROYAL MAIL IS 
INCREASING THE PRICE OF A FIRST 
CLASS STAMP FOR A STANDARD LETTER 
WEIGHING UP TO ONE HUNDRED GRAMMES BY TWO P. TO 
THIRTY SIX P. AND SECOND CLASS STAMPS GO UP 
BY THREE P. TO TWENTY SEVEN P. THE AVERAGE COST OF 
HELPING A GIRL ACHIEVE ONE OF HER 
TOP TEN CAREER ASPIRATIONS IS 
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A BOY'S 
THIS IS THE CLAIM FROM THE 
PETERBOROUGH BUILDING SOCIETY WHICH 
SAYS A SURVEY SHOWED THAT THE TOP 
FIVE CAREER ASPIRATIONS FOR GIRLS 
ARE TO BECOME A VET HAIRDRESSER 
TEACHER ARTIST OR A SINGER THESE 
CONTRAST WITH THE TOP FIVE CAREER 
ASPIRATIONS FOR BOYS WHICH ARE TO 
BECOME A FOOTBALLER POLICE OFFICER 
FIRE FIGHTER CAR MECHANIC OR A 
FORMULA ONE RACING DRIVER 
IMAGINE IF YOUR PROPERTY WAS ON THE 
VERGE OF FALLING INTO THE SEA AND 
THERE WAS NOTHING YOU COULD DO 
ABOUT IT ITS VALUE WOULD TUMBLE TO 
VIRTUALLY NOTHING AND DON'T EVEN 
THINK ABOUT GETTING INSURANCE THIS 
WEEK ROB WILL BE MEETING THE PEOPLE 
IN EAST ANGLIA WHO FACE EXACTLY 
THAT FATE FOR THEIR HOMES AND 
BUSINESSES BUSINESSES THIS IS HAPPISBURGH IN NORTH 
NORFOLK A PLACE WHERE A SIMPLE 
COUNTRY LANE LIKE THIS COULD 
SUDDENLY PLUNGE OVER A NEWLY 
ARRIVED CLIFF AND WHERE AN ENTIRE 
SANDY BAY COULD APPEAR IN JUST A 
FEW YEARS IN FACT IN THE LAST 
FIVE YEARS MORE THAN TWENTY BUILDINGS 
HERE HAVE COLLAPSED AND THE OWNERS 
OF HOMES NOW THREATENED BY THE SEA 
KNOW IF THEIRS GO TOO THEY WON'T 
GET A PENNY IN COMPENSATION I'LL 
BE SPEAKING TO THEM AND WE'LL HEAR 
FROM A MAN WHOSE HOME HAS JUST BEEN 
VALUED AT ONLY ONE 
LIKE I JUST SAID 
YOU WORK ALL YOUR LIFE TO PAY FOR 
SOMETHING YOU KNOW AND YOU'VE GOT 
TO START AGAIN 
FURTHER DOWN THE 
COAST IN SUFFOLK SOUTHWOLD HARBOUR 
IS UNDER THREAT TOO AS THE SEA EATS 
AWAY AT CENTURIES OLD DEFENCES 
THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE HAD A BREACH 
IN THE MUD BANK WHICH PROTECTS THIS 
MARSH WE'VE REACHED A POINT HERE 
WHERE THIS IS DISINTEGRATING AND 
THE EXTRA VOLUME OF WATER IS HAVING 
AN EFFECT ALREADY 
THE WORRY HERE 
IS IF THE WALLS AREN'T MAINTAINED 
THE SEA WILL BREAK THROUGH AND 
SWAMP ALL OF THIS I'LL BE FINDING 
OUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE 
BUSINESSES THAT HAVE GROWN UP HERE 
WATCH OUT FOR THAT STARTING 
TOMORROW TOMORROW NOW AS ANY GOOD WORKING LUNCH 
VIEWER WILL ALREADY KNOW THE TEN PER CENT 
TAX BAND CEASED TO EXIST AS OF 
YESTERDAY THE GOVERNMENT IS SAYING 
IT HAS NO INTENTION OF GOING BACK 
ON THAT CHANGE BUT IT'S STILL 
CAUSING CONTROVERSY TODAY AN 
IMPORTANT COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS HAS DESCRIBED THE NEW 
SYSTEM AS STRANGE BECAUSE IT 
DISADVANTAGES LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS 
SO JUST HOW DID WE GET TO THIS 
POINT POINT HERE'S SIMON 
THE STORY OF THE RISE AND FALL OF 
GORDON BROWN'S TEN PER CENT TAX RATE GOES 
BACK TO THE BUDGET OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE 
I HAVE 
TO TELL THE HOUSE THAT THE TEN P. RATE 
WILL NOT START IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND LIKE 
OTHER INCOME TAX CHANGES WE ARE 
MAKING TODAY IT IS PRUDENT INSTEAD 
FOR PEOPLE TO GET THE BENEFIT OF 
THE TEN P. STARTING RATE NOW LABOUR LABOUR M. P.'S MAY HAVE BEEN CHEERING THEN 
BUT THEY'RE NOT NOW BECAUSE EIGHT 
YEARS LATER IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BUDGET HE 
HAD ANOTHER RABBIT TO PULL OUT OF 
THE HAT 
I WILL FROM NEXT APRIL CUT 
THE BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX FROM 
TWENTY TWO P. TO TWENTY P. 
AND TO PAY FOR THE 
LOWER BASIC RATE HE CONSIGNED THE 
TEN PER CENT BAND TO THE BIN AND DISCONTENT 
HAS BEEN BUILDING FOR A YEAR 
BECAUSE THE START DATE WAS DELAYED 
UNTIL NOW 
THERE ARE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE PERHAPS MORE THAN HE MIGHT 
EXPECT WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THE TEN P. 
TAX RATE OF COURSE EVEN THOSE WHO 
ARE BASIC RATE TAXPAYERS STILL PAID 
TEN PER CENT ON THAT SLICE OF THEIR INCOME 
AND SO THE TAX RATE ON THAT SLICE 
OF INCOME WILL STILL DOUBLE FOR 
THEM 
THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL THEM STUDIES ANALYSIS OF THOSE LOSING 
OUT FROM THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN PER CENT 
BAN PUTS THE NUMBER WORSE OFF AT 
FIVE POINT THREE MILLION FAMILIES THEY HAVE 
EARNINGS OR PENSIONS BETWEEN FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WITH A MAXIMUM LOSS OF 
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO A YEAR THE GROUP IS MADE UP OF TWENTY TWO MILLION 
SINGLE PEOPLE WITHOUT CHILDREN WHO 
DON'T GET THE TAX CREDITS WHICH 
HAVE BEEN RAISED TO SOFTEN THE BLOW 
ONE POINT TWO MILLION COUPLES WITHOUT 
CHILDREN WHO DON'T GET ENOUGH TAX 
CREDIT TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WHO AREN'T WORKING OR HAVE 
RETIRED EARLY AND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FEMALE 
PENSIONERS BETWEEN SIXTY AND SIXTY FOUR WHO 
DON'T BENEFIT FROM A RISE IN THE 
SPECIAL TAX ALLOWANCE FOR 
PENSIONERS OF SIXTY FIVE AND OVER 
BOTH WOMEN WHO HAVE JUST REACHED 
PENSION AGE ARE PARTICULARLY 
INDIGNANT ABOUT LOSING OUT MANY 
HAVE HAD TO RETIRE FROM LONG 
STANDING JOBS AT SIXTY MANY HAVE TOLD 
US THE SPECIAL PENSIONERS' 
ALLOWANCES SHOULD START AT SIXTY NOT 
SIXTY FIVE TO COMPENSATE 
THEY HAVE HAD A 
YEAR TO THINK ABOUT IT AND I THINK 
MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WHEN THIS 
BUDGET WAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN CHANGED IN SOME WAY TO 
HELP WOMEN BETWEEN SIXTY AND SIXTY FIVE BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY THE GOVERNMENT 
HASN'T DONE THAT 
THE NUMBER OF 
LOSERS COULD BE EVEN GREATER THAN 
THE FIFTY THREE MILLION ESTIMATE FROM THE 
INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES 
BECAUSE ONLY ONE IN FIVE WORKING 
FAMILIES WITHOUT CHILDREN HAS BEEN 
CLAIMING WORKING TAX CREDIT THAT'S 
THE TAX CREDIT WHICH HAS BEEN 
RAISED TO TRY TO PREVENT FAMILIES 
BECOMING WORSE OFF WELL SIMON IS 
WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO THE 
INFLUENTIAL TREASURY SELECT 
COMMITTEE HAS CRITICISED THE 
REMOVAL OF THAT TEN PER CENT TAX BAND AND 
WE'RE NOW JOINED DOWN THE LINE BY 
THE CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE LABOUR 
M. P. JOHN MCFALL OUR INTERVIEWEE 
CAROL JUST PUT IT INTO CONTEXT 
THERE VERY LAUDABLE YOU AS A 
SELECT COMMITTEE ARE FLAGGING THIS 
UP TODAY BUT YOU HAVE HAD A YEAR 
I MEAN YOU AS A SELECT COMMITTEE 
HAVE FAILED THE LOWER PAID PEOPLE 
OF THIS COUNTRY 
LET ME TELL YOU 
IT WAS A SELECT COMMITTEE WHICH 
IDENTIFIED THIS WELL OVER A YEAR 
AGO IT WAS A SELECT COMMITTEE 
WHICH HAD GORDON BROWN AS 
CHANCELLOR BEFORE WHICH WAS 
MENTIONING THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT 
TO HIM AND WE HAVE TO SEE THIS 
ISSUE IN CONTEXT IN THAT THE 
REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX FROM TWENTY TWO P. TO 
TWENTY P. IS GOING TO BE OF ASSISTANCE TO 
TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE WHAT WE SAID TO 
GORDON BROWN IS THAT'S GOOD 
THAT'S ALL WELL HOWEVER WE NEED 
TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE LOW 
INCOMES UNDER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR DO NOT 
GET DISADVANTAGED SO THIS IS AN 
ISSUE WHICH IS STILL LIVE ON THE 
AGENDA WHAT WE'VE ASKED GORDON 
BROWN AND ALISTAIR DARLING TO DO IS 
TO FIRST OF ALL GET THAT TAKE UP 
RATE UP IT'S NINETEEN PER CENT ON THE WORKING 
TAX CREDIT FOR SOME FAMILIES THAT 
IS JUST TOO LOW BY ANY MEANS SO WE 
HAVE TO HAVE A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO 
ENSURE THAT THAT TAKE UP RATE IS 
INCREASED AND SECONDLY THE PEOPLE 
THAT ARE GOING TO BE LOSING HERE 
HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED TO SEE WHAT 
THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO 
MR. MCFALL 
ON THAT TAKE UP RATE TALKING TO 
THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES 
TODAY I MEAN THEY SAY THAT'S 
IMPORTANT BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 
A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO 
WOULD BENEFIT IF THE TAKE UP RATE 
WAS COMPLETE NOT NINETEEN PER CENT THEY'RE 
STILL THERE'S STILL FIVE MILLION 
WHO ARE LIKELY TO LOSE OUT WHAT DO 
YOU DO ABOUT THEM 
THE ISSUE OF THE 
CHILD POVERTY CONTRIBUTION IS VERY 
IMPORTANT WE PUSHED THE GOVERNMENT 
ON THE ISSUE OF CHILD POVERTY IN 
FACT OUR LAST REPORT THE PRE 
BUDGET REPORT STATED VERY 
EXPLICITLY THAT WE'RE FEARFUL THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT ARE RESILING FROM 
THEIR COMMITMENT ON THAT AS A 
RESULT OF THAT ALISTAIR DARLING IN 
THE BUDGET STATED THAT ANOTHER 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN WILL BE TAKEN OUT 
OF POVERTY WITH AN EXTRA ONE BILLION 
THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN BY THE BUDGET 
SO WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE 
WORKING TAX CREDIT THE CHILD 
BENEFIT THE CHILD POVERTY THE 
FUEL POVERTY INITIATIVES WE'VE GOT 
TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THESE KICK IN 
TOGETHER TO MITIGATE THE LOSSES 
THAT HAVE BEEN FELT BY THESE PEOPLE 
DOWNING STREET HAS MADE IT CLEAR 
TODAY THAT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE 
A U. TURN ON THIS THEY'RE NOT GOING 
TO BRING BACK THE TEN P. RATE SO WHAT 
ELSE WOULD YOU SUGGEST APART FROM 
IMPROVING TAKE UP OF THOSE TACTS 
CREDITS YOU MENTIONED WHAT WOULD 
YOU SUGGEST FOR THE OTHER FIVE 
MILLION WHO MIGHT BE LOSING OUT I I DON'T THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN 
GO BACK ON THIS BECAUSE IF WE LOOK 
AT THE SUMS OF MONEY INVOLVED THEY 
ARE ENORMOUS MENTION HAS BEEN MADE 
TO ME THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT SEVEN TO EIGHT 
BILLION HERE WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO 
IS TO ENSURE THERE IS A PROGRESSIVE 
APPROACH TO THIS SO I SUGGEST TO 
YOU THE INCREASE IN TAKE UP L. HAVE 
ALSO SUGGESTED THAT IDENTIFYING 
PEOPLE WITH THEIR NEEDS SO THAT 
THEY COULD POSSIBLY BE HELPED WITH 
THE CHILD POVERTY WITH THEIR FUEL 
POVERTY TARGETS SO THE GOVERNMENT 
HAVE REALLY GOT TO DO SOMETHING ON 
THIS 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK THIS TODAY ABOUT YOU ABANDONING YOUR 
CORE VOTERS IN FACT I WENT ON 
YOUR WEBSITE AND ACTUALLY SAW THE 
AMOUNT THAT'S WRITTEN ABOUT MAKE 
POVERTY HISTORY THE LOWER PAID 
PEOPLE SO CLEARLY IT'S CLOSE TO 
YOUR LART BUT ARE THESE REALLY 
CORE VOTERS TO YOUR PARTY HEART 
ARE YOU ACCEPTING AS A POLITICIAN 
YOU HAVE NOW ABANDONED THOSE PEOPLE 
AND ARE NOW GOING FOR THE MIDDLE 
CLASS THE HIGHER PAID PEOPLE I I DON'T THINK SO IN ORDER TO GOVERN 
YOU HAVE TO GOVERN FOR ALL THE 
PEOPLE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS 
THAT'S ONE OF THE LESSONS THE 
LABOUR PARTY LEARNED WHEN WE WERE 
TALKING TO OURSELVES IN THE SEVENTIES 
AND EIGHTIES AND WE WERE OUT OF 
GOVERNMENT WE HAVE TO GOVERN FOR 
EVERYONE FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I 
WROTE TO THE NATIONAL PAPERS BEFORE 
THE BUDGET THIS YEAR TO DAVID 
BLUNKETT AND A NUMBER OF OTHERS TO 
ASK THE GOVERNMENT TO STICK BY ITS 
CHILD POVERTY TARGETS AND INDEED 
THE WHOLE TREASURY COMMITTEE 
COMPRISING REPRESENTIVES FROM ALL 
THE PARTIES AND PARLIAMENT HAVE 
SIGNED UP TO THAT IT'S VERY 
IMPORTANT WE DO IT AND ALISTAIR 
DARLING DID RESPOND IN THE BUDGET 
BY PROVIDING ONE BILLION FOR THE 
CHILD POVERTY TARGETS 
BUSINESS WILL MANY THINGS TO 
WIN CUSTOMERS BUT WHAT ABOUT 
OPERATING IN TWO LANGUAGES IN 
WALES THE PUBLIC SECTOR GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONS SCHOOLS 
AND HOSPITALS 
HAVE HAD 
TO PROVIDE 
SERVICES IN WELSH SINCE THE EARLY 
NINETEEN NINETIES BUT NOW 
MORE AND 
MORE 
PRIVATE 
SECTOR COMPANIES 
ARE 
VIEWING 
A BILINGUAL 
POLICY AS 
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY AS RACHEL HAS 
BEEN FINDING OUT 
THERE ARE ALMOST THREE MILLION PEOPLE 
IN WALES AND ONE IN FIVE OF THEM 
SPEAK WELSH THE WELSH ASSEMBLY 
GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY MADE IT A 
LEGAL DUTY FOR ALL PUBLIC SECTOR 
BODIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND 
SIGNS IN WELSH NOW IT SEEMS THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR IS STARTING TO THINK 
THAT BEING BILINGUAL COULD BE GOOD 
FOR BUSINESS 
GIVING IT 
A GO IS THE ROYAL HOTEL IN CARDIFF 
PART OF A SMALL CHAIN OF 
INDEPENDENT HOTELS THEY LAUNCHED A 
WELSH LANGUAGE VERSION OF THEIR 
WEBSITE LAST SUMMER THIS YEAR HAVE 
BEEN TRAINING STAFF IN BASIC WELSH 
LANGUAGE SCHOOLS 
THIS IS MAINLY 
DRIVEN BY THE FACT THAT THERE IS 
GOING TO BE 
A BIG BOSCH FESTIVAL 
TAKING PLACE IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND EIGHT A BIG 
WELSH FESTIVAL TAKING PLACE IN 
CARDIFF IN AUGUST SO OUR FRONTLINE 
STAFF CAN GREET PEOPLE IN WELSH 
PERHAPS GIVE THEM BASIC DIRECTIONS 
IT IS NOT GOING TO BE ANYTHING 
COMPLICATED IT IS JUST A GESTURE 
TO SAY THAT WE ARE 
IN THE 
CAPITAL 
CITY AND 
WE KNOW 
THAT THIS 
IS YOUR 
LANGUAGE 
AND WE 
WOULD LIKE TO WORK 
WITH YOU 
IT HAS 
NOT BEEN VERY 
EXPENSIVE IT HAS BEEN A WORTHWHILE 
EXERCISE IT DID COST US MONEY WE 
ARE A 
SMALL COMPANY 
WITHOUT 
FUNDS 
BUT WE 
THINK IT HAS BEEN 
WORTHWHILE 
MICKEY AND HER TEAM WORTHWHILE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE WELSH 
LANGUAGE BOARD SET UP 
IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
TO 
PROMOTE THE USE OF WELSH MAINLY WORK 
WITH THE 
PUBLIC SECTOR 
BUT 
THEY SAY 
MORE AND 
MORE PRIVATE 
SECTOR COMPANIES ARE ASKING FOR 
THEIR HELP MICKEY AND HER TEAM 
THE EVIDENCE IS TO BE SEEN ALL 
AROUND WALES NEARLY ALL THE BANKS 
AND SUPERMARKETS ARE USING 
BILINGUAL MARKETING ADVERTISING 
AND PACKAGING THE ASSISTANCE THAT 
THE BOARD CAN GIVE TO THEM IS 
LIMITED WE GIVE THEM ONE TO ONE ADVICE 
FOR SMALLER BUSINESSES WE PROVIDE 
THEM WITH FREE TRANSLATION WE ALSO 
PROVIDE THEM WITH SMALL GRANTS AND 
WE ALSO PROVIDE THEM WITH TOOLS TO 
HELP DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT POLICY 
SO THAT THEY CAN ADDRESS 
BILINGUALISM IN THEIR BUSINESS 
EFFECTIVELY IT MAY NOT BE 
SOMETHING THEY HAVE DONE BEFORE SO SO HELP IS AVAILABLE BUT WITH FIGURES 
SUGGESTING VERY FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY 
USE A WELSH LANGUAGE 
OPTION IS IT 
REALLY 
WORTH INVESTING 
THE TIME AND 
MONEY NEEDED 
THE HURDLES COMPANIES 
HAVE TO COME IN DELIVERING SERVICES 
THEY ARE VERY REAL COSTS INVOLVED 
IN PRODUCING LITERATURE IN BOTH 
LANGUAGES SIGNED IT ETC BUT 
OVERALL I THINK THE ATTITUDE IS 
VERY POSITIVE COMPANIES WANT TO 
DEMONSTRATE A REAL COMMITMENT TO 
WALES AND TO THE PEOPLE OF WALES 
AND THEY 
WANT 
TO BE 
SEEN AS 
PART OF THE WELSH BUSINESS 
COMMUNITY THERE IS NO REAL 
COMMERCIAL RETURN YET TO THE COSTS 
INVOLVED THE USAGE IS STILL QUITE 
LOW WE ARE VERY KEEN THAT WE GET 
THAT YOU SIT UP TO REWARD 
COMPANIES WHICH ARE DOING THIS ON A 
VOLUNTARY BASIS 
THE PUSH TOWARDS WELSH 
IS CERTAINLY GOOD FOR SOME 
BUSINESSES BUSINESSES SARAH RICHARDS RUNS A TRAINING AND 
EVENTS COMPANY WHICH SPECIAL 
SPECIALISES IN HELPING BUSINESSES 
GO BILINGUAL 
SOME PEOPLE CAN SEE 
IT AS A BUSINESS ADVANTAGE THEY 
ARE GETTING A WIDER AUDIENCE BY 
USING BILINGUALISM OTHERS COME 
FROM A HEART BECAUSE THEY ARE 
WELSH SPEAKING THEMSELVES SOME SOME MIGHT THINK GOING BILINGUAL IS AN 
EXPENSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD WHAT 
WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM 
SMALL STEPS 
CAN BE MADE AT A 
FAIRLY LOW 
WE ARE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE SIGN 
AGE AND BUYING IN ALL MENUS BASIC 
MEET AND GREET COURSES A LOT OF 
STUFF CAN BE DONE AT LOW COST 
CURRENTLY PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES 
ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE 
THEIR SERVICES IN WELSH IN THE 
SHORT TERM THERE ARE NO FIGURES TO 
SUGGEST THAT GOING BILINGUAL WILL 
BRING 
IN MORE BUSINESS BUT 
LONG TERM MANY FEEL THAT ADOPTING 
THE WELSH LANGUAGE SHOWS A 
COMMITMENT TO WALES AND ITS 
CONSUMERS THAT SHOULD PAY OFF 
ON TO THE MARKETS AGAIN 
WE ARE WITHIN SPITTING DISTANCE OF 
SIX THOUSAND ON THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED THE MARKET 
HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE 
PLACE AND 
WITH EXPECTATIONS OF 
AN IMMINENT 
CUT IN 
INTEREST RATES 
THERE 
YET BE MORE VOLATILITY 
SO HOW 
SHOULD INVESTORS 
PLAY THE 
GREAT 
INVESTMENT GAME 
WHERE IN FACT IS 
THE MARKET GOING 
WELCOME TO PLAY YOUR SHARES RIGHT 
IS YOUR HOST ADAM SHAW 
GOOD AFTERNOON NICE TO SEE TO 
SEE FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE ON THE 
CARDS JEREMY BATSTONE CARR FROM 
CHARLES STANLEY YOU HAVE COME ALL 
THE WAY FROM OFFICE WHERE IS THE 
STOCK 
MARKET 
MARKET GOING OVER 
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS 
WE THINK THE 
F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED WILL END THE YEAR AT SIX THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED 
THAT SOUNDS A BIT OPTIMISTIC AT THE 
MOMENT BUT I JUST SENSE 
THAT WE 
HAVE REACHED 
A TURNING POINT IN 
SENTIMENT BAD NEWS IS NO LONGER GREETED BY 
SHARP FALLS 
IN THE 
STOCK 
MARKET I 
CAN'T SAY 
WE ARE 
OUT OF 
THE WOODS YET BUT INVESTORS I 
THINK HAVE NOW BEGUN TO PRICE IN 
THE RECESSION SLOWDOWN IN 
PROFITABILITY THAT INDICATES THAT 
THE STOCK MARKET BEING A PREDICTED 
INDICATOR THAT INVESTORS SHOULD BE 
THINKING ABOUT THE ULTIMATE UP TO 
NOW RATHER THAN THE INCIPIENT 
SLOWDOWN SLOWDOWN SO THE NET IN THE NEXT THREE 
MONTHS THE MARKET IS GOING TO GO 
AT DOWN 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ARE WE GOING 
HIGHER AND LOWER HIGHER OR 
LOWER LAURA 
DAVID BUIK FROM E. D. C. LOWER LAURA PARTNERS 
CONSIDERING THE GRAVITY PARTNERS OF THE CREDIT CRISIS I'M AMAZED AT 
THE RESILIENCE OF THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED 
WHICH IS JUST A FEW POINTS SHORT OF 
SIX THOUSAND L. STILL BELIEVE THERE ARE 
SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH RETAIL 
PROPERTY AND HOUSING THEREFORE 
THE F. T. S. E. IS LIKELY TO FALL THREE HUNDRED 
POINTS TO AROUND FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED BY THE END OF 
JUNE AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE A 
RALLY TO NEARER SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BY THE END OF 
THE YEAR 
DIDN'T YOU DO WELL 
BECAUSE YOU GOT IT RIGHT YOUR 
DAUGHTER WAS GOING TO BE LOWER AND 
IT IS JUSTIN EMMA CLARKE STEWART 
FROM SEVEN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT IS 
NEXT HIGHER OR LOWER LOWER AGAIN 
FLIP THAT CARD AND LET'S SEE WHAT 
HE HAS TO SAY 
THREE MONTHS NOT 
TOO GOOD THIS IS A BEAR RALLY AT 
THE MOMENT L. EXPECTED TO GO WORSE HOWEVER BY THE END 
OF THE 
YEAR 
MIGHT 
HAVE A 
LITTLE 
MORE BETTER 
NEWS IF WE ACTUALLY GET THINGS 
SOME 
BAD NEWS 
OUT OF THE WAY SO IT 
IS MUD BLOOD 
AND GREEN 
BEYOND BY THE END OF THE YEAR BE SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED 
BUT IN 
THE MEANTIME MUD AND 
BLOOD 
LAST CARD JAMES USED HE BLOOD WAS LOWER IS THE NEXT CARD HIGHER 
OR LOWER HIGHER THEY SAY LETS 
SLIP THAT CADRES SEE WHAT HE HAS TO 
SAY 
WITH THE BANKING PROBLEMS SAY DYING AWAY AND BANKS LOOKING A 
LITTLE BIT STRONGER WE ARE LOOKING 
AT THE 
F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED 
TO 
BE A 
STRONGER OVER 
THE NEXT 
THREE MONTHS 
OR SO OF COURSE WITH NEXT WEEK'S 
INTEREST RATE 
DECISION WE 
ARE GOOD 
TO 
SEE A 
LITTLE UNCERTAINTY AHEAD 
OF THAT IF WE DO GET A RATE CUT 
LOWER THAN PEOPLE EXPECT WE WILL 
SEE THE INDEX GO HIGHER SO FOR THE 
END OF THE YEAR WE ARE LOOKING AT 
SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BUT WE HAVE A KEY 
PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL 
OF 
SIX THOUSAND ON 
THE 
UPSIDE IF 
WE SEE THAT BROKEN 
THROUGH MANY WILL BE LOOKING FOR 
THAT RALLY 
TO BE SUSTAINED ABOVE 
THAT LEVEL 
PLAYED WELL BECAUSE 
YOUR DAUGHTER WAS GOING TO BE 
HIGHER AND HE WAS HIGHER 
AND NOW I AM BACK IN THE ROOM 
THERE WE HAVE FOR ANALYSTS AMAIA 
SPIT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE THOUGHT THEY 
WERE GOING 
TO BE 
HIGHER OVER THE 
MONTHS 
TWO 
THOUGHT THEY 
WERE GOING TO BE 
DOWN IT SHOWS YOU HAVE CONFUSED 
THE MARKET IS AT THE 
MOMENT ALL 
WE 
CAN 
SAY FOR 
CERTAIN IS THE MARKET 
HAD A GOOD MORNING THIS MORNING AND 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT ON AVERAGE 
APRIL IS A VERY GOOD MONTH FOR 
SHARES THE STOCK 
MARKET ON 
AT 
CLAIMS IT 
IS THE 
STRONGEST 
MONTH OF 
THE YEAR WITH AN AVERAGE RISE OF 
TWO POINT EIGHT PER CENT THE STOCK MARKET ALMANAC 
THE NATIONAL UNION OF STUDENTS IS 
FACING A SPLIT WITHIN ITS RANKS 
AFTER DECIDING TO END ITS 
OPPOSITION TO UNIVERSITY TUITION 
FEES 
THE UNION 
HAS NOW 
DECIDED TO 
FOCUS ITS 
ATTENTION ON 
STOPPING 
GOVERNMENT INCREASING FEES 
IN THE 
FUTURE AFTER CAMPAIGNING 
FOR YEARS 
ON 
THE TICKET 
OF FREE 
THE MOTION WAS 
PASSED AT 
THE N. U. S. 
CONFERENCE LAST WEEK 
WES STREETING IS THE INCOMING 
PRESIDENT OF THE N. U. S. THIS IS A 
BACK TIDDLERS BAPTISM OF FIRE FOR 
YOU WHY THE TURNAROUND 
REALISTICALLY WE FACE AN IMPORTANT 
CHOICE NEXT YEAR AS THE GOVERNMENT 
AND PARLIAMENT LOOKED 
TO REVIEW 
THE 
CURRENT SYSTEM OF FEES IN ENGLAND 
WE CAN CONTINUE TO DEMAND FREE 
EDUCATION AS WE ALWAYS HAVE AND WE 
STILL 
FIRMLY BELIEVE 
IN 
ALL WE 
RECOGNISE THE DEBATE HAS MOVED ON 
IF 
WE CONTINUE 
TO MAKE THE SAME 
ARGUMENT STUDENTS WILL LOSE OUT 
LAST WEEK OUR MEMBERS DECIDED THEY 
DID NOT WANT US TO 
LOSE OUT 
THEY WANTED 
US TO 
DO THE 
RADICAL 
THING WHICH 
IS TO 
PRAGMATICALLY AT THE SITUATION AND 
HOW WE CAN MAKE THE MOST DIFFERENCE 
TO STUDENTS' LIVES 
BUT THE 
STUDENTS ARE 
GOING TO 
BE LOOKING 
OVER THE BORDER TO SCOTLAND WHERE 
THEY HAVE 
HAD FUTURE ASIAN FREE 
TUITION THIS IS A MASSIVE LET DOWN 
FOR THE STUDENTS AND THE PARENTS 
WHO OFTEN FIND THEM 
SCOTLAND IS A 
GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHERE WE ARE 
PUTTING OUR POLICY INTO PRACTICE 
WHERE WE CAN WIN FREE EDUCATION WE 
WILL IN ENGLAND THE DEBATE IS 
DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE POLITICAL 
PARTIES HAVE DIFFERENT POSITIONS 
WE HAVE A LABOUR GOVERNMENT IN 
WESTMINSTER AND A CONSERVATIVE 
OPPOSITION THAT IS NOT THE CASE IN 
SCOTLAND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS 
THAT THE CHALLENGER TO THOSE THREE 
MAIN PARTIES WE ARE WILLING TO BE 
OPEN MINDED THE CHALLENGE I'M 
PUTTING TO ALL THREE PARTIES IS 
ARE YOU WILLING TO OR HAVE THE BIG 
DEBATE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE BECAUSE WE ARE READY 
FOR IT WE HAVE THE PRINCIPLES AND 
POLICY 
TO TAKE 
US 
FORWARD AND 
ARE 
NOT SURE THEY HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
SAY YOU 
AS UNION HAVE SOLD OUT 
GIVEN 
UP AND 
THIS 
IS NOT 
POSITION YOU 
WANT TO 
BE IN I 
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY THING TO 
SAY NO WE'RE GOING TO LEAD THE 
CHARGE AGAIN FOR FREE EDUCATION AND 
MAKE RADICAL TO MARS BUT I 
THAT IS THE REAL SELL OUT TO LEAD 
OUR MEMBERS IN TO THAT DEBATE AND 
MAKE OUT THAT IS AVAILABLE 
HOW DO 
YOU RATE THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS AT 
LEAST ON THIS ISSUE 
I THINK THERE 
IS A 
VACUUM OF 
LEADERSHIP 
ON HIGHER 
EDUCATION FUNDING 
BOTH OF 
THE MAIN 
PARTIES ARE 
BEING 
COY ABOUT 
THEY THINK ABOUT 
THE CAT 
WE THINK 
IT 
IS A 
DAMAGING SYSTEM 
AND HAVE NO 
TRUCK WITH IT ABOUT THE CAP 
WATCHING THE STANCE OF THE 
GOVERNMENT ON THE LOWER PAID 
EARLIER BRIEFLY DO YOU THINK YOU 
STAND ANY 
CHANCE OF THE HEARING THAT I THINK 
IT IS 
VERY THAT ONE OF 
THE THINGS 
WE ARE 
FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT IS 
THE 
NEED TO 
OPEN UP 
DEMOCRACY AND 
OPEN 
UP TO 
PEOPLE TO GET MORE PEOPLE ARE 
INVOLVED AND TALK OF CITIZENSHIP 
HE WAS A GROUP OF CITIZENS WILLING 
TO ENGAGE AN BE PRAGMATIC LET'S 
SEE IF THE GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO 
LISTEN TO THEM 
THERE IS LOTS OF 
INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE WITH
