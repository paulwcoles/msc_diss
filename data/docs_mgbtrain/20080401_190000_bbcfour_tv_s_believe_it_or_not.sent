TELEVISION IS A GREAT ART FORM A MIGHTY GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD 
IT HAS BROUGHT FREEDOM TO THE OPPRESSED 
HAS RAISED UP THE GOOD AND BROUGHT DOWN THE BAD 
AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT THERE'S TOM AND AMP JERRY AND SCOOBY DOO 
UNBELIEVABLE BY E. M. F. 
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE 
STOP IT STOP THAT BELL 
THE REAL PURPOSE OF TELLY IS AFTER A LONG DAY YOU CAN SIT DOWN 
AND BE SURE NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY'VE TRIED 
THERE'LL BE SOMETHING ON THAT WILL UN MANGLE YOUR SQUEAKY VALVE 
DE MERGE YOUR PRANNET SELECTORS AND OVER FETTLE YOUR TINKLE NODES 
YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING WHAT'S HE ON ABOUT RUBBISH 
HE SHOULDN'T BE ON YOU'RE RIGHT I SHOULDN'T 
ONIONS BUT I AM AND I'LL CARRY ON TILL THEY STOP ME I HATE PINGU 
I HATE PINGU 
STOP IT SEAN O. K. SORRY 
THEY ARE THE HIERARCHICAL POWER 
THIS PROGRAMME IS A CELEBRATION OF THE WAYS TELEVISION GETS IT WRONG 
PROPERLY WRONG 
WRONG WITH ITS PANTS DOWN SPECTACULARLY WRONG 
AS WRONG AS THE SKY AT NIGHT LIVE 
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE RUN INTO A BANK OF CLOUD 
AS WRONG AS A RACIST FOLK SONG 
COS I DIDN'T LIKE PORTUGUESE IN GENERAL AND IN PARTICULAR I DIDN'T LIKE HIM 
AS WRONG AS LETTING CAPTAIN KIRK SING 
AND THAT'S ABOUT AS WRONG AS IT GETS 
THE TOUCHDOWN BRINGS ME DOWN AGAIN TO FIND 
I'M NOT THE MAN THEY THINK I AM AT ALL OH NO NO NO ON NO 
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE 
YOU'D HAVE THOSE CLEANERS IN OFF CHANNEL FOUR 
THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW ME 
KNOW FULL WELL THAT I HAVE TOLD YOU OF THESE THINGS ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
A LOT OF T. V. IS BROADCAST VIA SATELLITE 
THEY COULD HAVE SAVED LOADS OF MONEY IF THEY'D JUST USED THIS LOT 
MOST OF THEM ARE ALREADY ORBITING THE PLANET AND SHOWING NO SIGN OF RE ENTRY BARM POTS 
THEY WILL GO ON 
BUT NOW IT IS ANNOUNCED THE HIERARCHICAL POWERS 
WILL CONTINUE TO COME TO THE EARTH 
GROUND CONTROL TO MAJOR ETHEL 
TAKE YOUR ARTHRITIS PILLS AND PUT YOUR HELMET ON 
YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS HOUSE WITHOUT GOING OUT FOR FOUR YEARS 
LAZY 
WHY HAVE YOU STAYED HERE TO BUILD UP A SPINNING HUB OF SPIRITUAL LIFE 
AND EVERYTHING IS SPUN FROM THIS ROOM THIS ROOM IS CONSIDERED THE HUB OF THE WORLD 
EVERYTHING IS RULED FROM THIS ROOM 
I'VE GOT A ROOM LIKE THAT AS WELL 
YOU MAY UNDERSTAND IT BETTER WHEN HE'S BEEN THROUGH AND EXPLAINED IT 
WHO WHO'S THIS THE MASTER TONIGHT HE IS THE GREAT MASTER 
I STILL ALSO WANT TO KNOW THE MASTER OF WHO AND WHAT AND WHEREFORE 
I WANT TO LEARN SOMETHING TOO HE'S YOUR GUIDE 
HE'S MORE THAN THAT HE IS A VERY SUPERIOR ENTITY 
A VERY VERY SUPERIOR ENTITY A POWERFUL ENTITY 
IT'S NOT UNCLE ALBERT IS IT 
SO IT'S DEFINITELY NOT YOU THEN JUST TO CLEAR THAT UP 
I A. M. THE MASTER 
OF YOUR SO CALLED FLYING SAUCERS 
HANG ON IT IS YOU 
THEY ARE THE HIERARCHAL POWERS DESCENDING TO THE EARTH 
I SOMETIMES HEAR VOICES 
THEY SAY GO HOME DO THE WASHING UP GO TO BED EARLY I ALWAYS IGNORE THEM 
AND CARRY ON KILLING 
STAR SIGNS WAS AN ATTEMPT 
TO TURN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE PARANORMAL 
INTO PRIME TIME ENTERTAINMENT 
IT DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE YOU CAN'T VOTE GHOSTS OFF 
I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHERE THIS HAS COME FROM IT'S A LADY'S 
I COULD BE ONE OF THIRTY OR FORTY 
THIS BLOKE HASN'T GOT HIS CLAIRVOYANT'S LICENCE YET 
I WANT TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION BUT I COULD BE OVER HERE 
KEEP IT VAGUE MATE 
I THINK IS MIGHT BE SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE 
BUT I DON'T WANT TO COMMIT MYSELF CAN I HAVE A SERIES 
THERE LOOKS TO BE A LADY OVER THERE THE FEEL IS OVER THERE 
BUT I MIGHT BE TOTALLY WRONG DOES IT BELONG TO A LADY OVER THERE 
IT DOES YES 
IS IT YOU YES DON'T BE AFRAID 
THAT WAS THE MOST UNDESERVED ROUND OF APPLAUSE I'VE EVER HEARD 
IS THERE A PHOTOGRAPH IN IT OR NOT THERE'S NOT I DIDN'T THINK SO 
YES YOU DID ARE YOU A PRACTICAL LADY 
YES DO YOU LIKE TO MAKE THINGS I DON'T MAKE THINGS NO 
NOT IN THAT SENSE YOU DON'T MAKE THINGS I WONDER WHAT SHE DOES MAKE 
SHE MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT 
HE'S NOT CLAIRVOYANT HE'S A WONDERER 
I COULD DO A SHOW LIKE THAT WHERE I WONDER IF ANYONE'S EATEN TOAST 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
VERY GOOD INDEED 
ACTUALLY I HEAR THEM THE WHOLE TIME SPIRIT VOICES YES 
ALL THE LOVED ONES THE GROUP THAT ONE HAS ASCERTAINED THROUGH YOUR SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT 
T. V.'S FIRST TELEPATHIC DUCHESS 
ARE THEY TALKING TO YOU ALL THE TIME YES 
THEY TALK TO ME AS YOU TALK TO ME SO THEY TALK TO ME 
I HEAR TELEPATHICALLY WHICH IS VERY MUCH NICER THAN WITH A VOICE 
CAN I ASK YOU WHAT THEY'RE TELLING YOU NOW THAT I'D HAVE TO WAIT FOR WOULDN'T I TO TELL YOU THAT 
WHILE I'M TALKING TO YOU I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THEY'RE SAYING 
CAN WE WAIT IF YOU LIKE YES 
LIFE IS IMMORTAL AND EVERYONE CAN DEVELOP THE SEVEN GLANDS IN THEIR BODY 
LIFE IS IMMORTAL 
AND EVERYONE CAN DEVELOP THE SEVEN GLANDS IN ONE'S BODY 
BACK IN THE STAR SIGNS STUDIO 
DARLINDA WAS TRYING TO IDENTIFY CELEBRITY GUESTS 
COLD HANDS WARM PERSONALITY 
BY FEELING THEIR FINGERS 
VERY STRONG LINES IN THEIR HAND 
SHE DIDN'T BECOME A TELLY STAR BUT WENT ON TO WORK NIGHTS IN A PETROL STATION 
NOT TOTALLY BEAUTIFUL BUT VERY ATTRACTIVE 
A NEW CONTRACT TO BE SIGNED 
I THINK SHE'S IN SOME SORT OF SHOW BUSINESS BUT I DON'T WATCH MUCH T. V. MYSELF OR FILMS 
SO WHY IDENTIFY CELEBRITIES BY THEIR HANDS IT WOULDN'T HELP IF WE SHOWED YOU HER FACE 
MAY HAVE QUITE A BIT OF TROUBLE LATER ON IN LIFE 
A RATHER UNFORTUNATE TIME TO FINISH IT 
THANKS VERY MUCH WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME BACK HERE 
SHE'S NOT PARTICULARLY TALL NOR IS SHE PARTICULARLY PLUMP SHE'S A SLENDER LADY 
THEY'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO A LADY 
IT MIGHT BE A MAN WITH LADY'S HANDS 
RAGEH OMAAR 
WOULD EITHER OF YOU LIKE TO COMMIT YOURSELVES TO A NAME 
I'D LIKE TO FREAK THEM OUT PUT KEIRA KNIGHTLY'S HANDS THROUGH THEN SEND OUT JOHN PRESCOTT 
LOOK AT THEIR LITTLE FACES 
I CAN SEE WHAT THEY'VE WRITTEN WOULD YOU HOLD THEM UP 
DARLINDA SAYS UNA STUBBS 
NO 
ROBIN SAYS FELICITY KENDALL 
NO THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT'S MICHAEL ASPEL 
REVEAL YOURSELF PLEASE 
HAVE WE GENERATED THIS HEAT 
PERSONALLY I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS 
BUT THEN I HAVE THOUGHT IT THROUGH 
ONCE UPON A TIME SKY T. V. LOCKED EIGHT CELEBRITIES IN A SCARY CASTLE 
AND MADE THEM STAY THERE UNTIL THEY HEARD VOICES 
IT TOOK ABOUT SIX MINUTES 
PAT'S SAYING VERY CLEARLY OH COME ON KID 
YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE UP SMOKING 
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT COME ON 
PAT PHOENIX WAS A CORONATION STREET LEGEND WHO DIED OF LUNG CANCER AGED SIXTY TWO 
THAT'S WHAT LIFE'S FOR ENJOYING 
I'M GETTING THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE UP SMOKING SORRY 
NOT FROM PAT EVER 
I DON'T THINK SHE'S TALKING TO PAT PHOENIX IT'S ALFRED DUNHILL 
IF PAT WAS HERE NOW SHE'D PUT A PACK OF TWENTY ON THE TABLE EXACTLY 
I'M SEEING SOMETHING ELSE IT'S ALL RIGHT 
I'M NOT EVEN JOKING 
PAT'S THE SORT OF PERSON RIGHT NOW ONIONS 
THE MOST UNSUBTLE ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT I'VE EVER SEEN 
WHAT COULD THAT BE IAN 
DOES IT MEAN ANYTHING DOES ONIONS MEAN ANYTHING TO ANYONE 
I HAD A LOT OF ONIONS IN MY SALAD TONIGHT 
IN THE OLD DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BURNT AS WITCHES 
ASK WHERE THE MESSAGE IS GOING TO 
SOMETIMES WE LET GO OF THESE OLD TRADITIONS TOO EASILY 
WHO DO YOU FEEL MOST DRAWN TO 
I DON'T KNOW ASK FOR SOMETHING ELSE WITH THE ONIONS 
HOT DOG SAGE CHEESE THERE'S LOADS OF THINGS 
IT'S LIKE READY STEADY COOK 
WHAT ELSE HAS SHE GOT IN HER BAG FAGS ONIONS BLEACH 
HOW MANY LANGUAGES DO YOU SPEAK

IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED LET'S TALK CRAZY 
MR. MOORE'S HAIR WAS DONE BY A PILLOW 
WHAT ABOUT PLUTONIAN WHAT DOES THAT SOUND LIKE 
PLUTONIAN IS MOR KALATA KOSTA KERKA

HOW DID YOU LEARN THESE LANGUAGES 
THESE LANGUAGES HAVE BEEN A GIFT 
SENT FROM ME FROM THE ACTUAL PEOPLE BY RAYS 
RAY PARLOUR RAY CLEMENCE RAY MEARS 
RAY REARDON ALL THE RAYS 
THEY ARE SENDING THEM TO HELP ME 
BY SOME MENTAL PROCESS OR SOME MECHANICAL PROCESS 
NO A MECHANICAL PROCESS

I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IT'S DONE WHAT ABOUT MARTIAN 
MARTIAN I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LANGUAGE 
ALTHOUGH I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THEM 
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THEM YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE PLANETS YOURSELF

I WONDER IF HE PUTS IT ON HIS C. V. 
I SPEAK PLUTONIAN 
OH YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE 
THANK YOU BOB WELL WE'VE SWITCHED BACK HERE TO THE TRACK LAYING OPERATION 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO THERE WAS A SEVERE OUTBREAK OF FOOD POISONING AT THE B. B. C.

DINOSAUR DEATH PLUNGE COWBOY SWEETSHOP GUNFIGHT AND EXPLODING TOADS LIVE 
BUT THEY WENT BIG ON HIS NEXT SHOW 
TRAIN DEATH CRASH PILE UP FRENZY DISASTER 
DOWN THE LINE OTHERS ARE READYING TO DESTROY A TRAIN 
BY DEMOLITION OF THE PERMANENT WAY 
AND THIS IS REALLY THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS PARTICULAR VISIT 
THIS IS THE LONGMOOR TRAIN CRASH 
THE FIRST AND ONLY LIVE TRAIN CRASH ON TELEVISION 
FORGET STRICTLY COME DANCING 
THIS IS WHAT USED TO PASS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT ENTERTAINMENT 
THIS IS THE GENUINE THING THERE'S NO TRICK PHOTOGRAPHY ABOUT IT 
SADLY 
BUT A ONE HUNDRED TON LOCOMOTIVE NOSE DIVING TO DESTRUCTION 
THE PURPOSE ENTERTAINMENT 
AND HERE SHE IS WITH BOB BEATTY ALONGSIDE HER 
THE RESULT UNDERTAINMENT 
MERLIN OF THE KING ARTHUR CLASS 
NOW SHE FACES HER LAST JOURNEY 
HER LAST MILE BECAUSE TONIGHT MERLIN IS GOING TO DIE 
DIE NOT AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT IN A BREAKERS' YARD 
BUT GLORIOUSLY IN THE SERVICE OF THE BRITISH ARMY 
I HOPE MERLIN FINDS THAT REASSURING I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD DO FOR ME 
FOR TONIGHT MERLIN PROVIDES A REALISTIC EXERCISE IN SABOTAGE 
NIGEL WANTED TO DO THE COMMENTARY BUT HE WAS SO EXCITED 
HE COULD ONLY SQUEAK 
GOODBYE MERLIN 
GOODBYE OLD GIRL 
BYE 
O. K. DRIVER TAKE HER AWAY 
YOU WON'T FORGET TO JUMP OFF DRIVER NO I'LL JUMP ALL RIGHT 
A MILE FURTHER DOWN THE SAME TRACK 
HERE IN A SENSE IS THE SPOT MARKED X. 
WHERE THE ACCIDENT WILL HAPPEN 
WHERE DEMOLITION CHARGES HAVE BEEN LAID 
THE TRAIN WRECKERS ARE BEHIND THE CREST 
TWO MEN WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AUTOMATIC WHAT 
WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS GIVING COVERING FIRE 
NOW WHERE IS THE TRAIN 
IT'S NOT THE COLD MAKING ME TREMBLE BUT THE EXCITEMENT 
IT'S TERRIFIC NOW OUT OF THAT BELT OF TIMBER IN THE BACKGROUND 
COMES ENGINE NUMBER THREE OH SEVEN FOUR OH AND THREE COACHES 
BELTING DOWN THE TRACK TO MEET THEIR END 
IN A MIGHTY CRASH OVER THE EMBANKMENT 
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED TONS TRAVELLING AT FORTY FIVE M. P. H. AND UNMANNED 
HERE SHE COMES 
A LINE TO BE BUCKLED AND WRECKED BY HIGH EXPLOSIVES 
WHICH WILL SEND HER HURTLING DOWN THE THIRTY FOOT SLOPE 
INTO A SNOW AND ICE COVERED MARSH 
IT'S TOP GEAR WITH TRAINS 
HERE SHE COMES VIVID REALISM THAT BRINGS TO LIFE 
THOSE DRAMATIC STORIES OF COMMANDO RAIDS OF THE WAR 
NOW HERE IS HIGH DRAMA IN REAL LIFE IT'S TERRIFYING 
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE FINAL HOLOCAUST OF TWISTED AND TORN METAL 
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE ON YOUR TELEVISION 
NOW WATCH 
THIS HAD BETTER BE REALLY GOOD HADN'T IT 
THE ENTIRE NATION UNIFIED BY OH 
I'VE CAUSED MORE DAMAGE TO TRAINS 
BY FLUSHING THE TOILET WHEN IT'S AT THE STATION 
WHAT A GRAND OLD LADY 
STILL ON HER LEGS 
INCREDIBLE RESTRAINT BY THE COMMENTATOR I THINK 
WELL YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE YOUR HAT OFF TO HER 
GREAT HEAVENS WHAT A FANTASTIC SIGHT STILL BLOWING HER WHISTLE 
YEAH BUT NOT QUITE THE ORGY OF TWISTED METAL WE'VE BEEN PROMISED 
NIGEL WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED HE TOOK HIS NEXT IDEA TO I. T. V. 
THAT WAS CORONATION STREET HE'D GROWN UP A BIT BY THEN 
WELL ONCE AGAIN SATURDAY NIGHT OUT 
HAS SHOWN YOU THINGS HAPPEN AS THEY HAPPEN 
WHEN THEY HAPPEN AND WHERE THEY HAPPEN 
IF THEY HAPPEN 
LIVE INTO EIGHTY FIVE TRIED TO CAPTURE ALL THE FUN EXCITEMENT AND CELEBRATION 
OF A TRADITIONAL SCOTTISH HOGMANAY 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY GOT 
OH UTTER CHAOS 
YES I'M OVER THERE I'M IN THE TALL GRASS I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE 
CHICK MURRAY HE WAS AN OLD SCHOOL PERFORMER 
I'VE GOT TO GIVE THIS AWAY NEEDED WRITTEN CONFIRMATION THAT HE WAS ON 
HAVE I. THERE'S NO CAMERAS ON ME 
TELEGRAM FOR MR. MURRAY 
WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
THEY'RE ALL LISTENING TO ME I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING 
THIS IS SOMEBODY STOLE A BOTTLE OF WHISKY 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BUT SOMEONE'S AWAY WITH THE WHISKY 
THAT IS THAT'S A PIECE OF BLACK BUN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS 
WELL YOU CAN HAVE THAT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
THAT'S YOU CAN HAVE THAT AS YOUR FIRST FRUIT 
HE'S NOT LOOKING A. T. SOMEONE HE'S LOOKING FOR SOMEONE 
TO TELL HIM WHAT TO DO 
THAT WAS THE PRODUCER SHOOTING HIMSELF 
SEE THOSE DRUNK PEOPLE AT THE TABLE ON THE LEFT 
DIRECTOR FLOOR MANAGER CAMERAMAN NIGEL 
IT'S LIKE AN EXPLOSION IN A BEWILDERMENT FACTORY 
MEANWHILE OVER IN ANOTHER PART OF THE HOTEL 
AS NEW YEAR'S EVE APPROACHES I GROW SADDER EVERY DAY 
IT MAKES ME MAD THAT I GET SAD FOR I KNOW I SHOULD BE GAY 
I KNOW I SHOULD BE GAY 
OH DEAR I'M AWAY 
I'LL START AGAIN 
AS NEW YEAR'S EVE APPROACHES I GROW SADDER EVERY DAY 
IT MAKES ME MAD THAT I GET SAD FOR I KNOW I SHOULD BE GAY 
YES 
IT MAKES ME MAD THAT I GET SAD 
IT MAKES ME MAD THAT I GET SAD FOR I KNOW I SHOULD BE GAY 
NEXT LINE 
HERE WE GO 
I GET LOST IN CONTEMPLATION 
I KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS DRUNK BUT HE WASN'T HE WAS USELESS 
NOPE THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO CUT TO 
FOR THAT JOY 
THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF NIGEL'S EARLY COMMISSIONS 
HE WANTED TO CALL IT BIG WET SHIP 
BIG BOAT ALL RAINY OR WET MEN IN A BOAT 
HE SAID I WANT TO SEE A BOAT IN A STORM AND THE CAPTAIN GET WET 
THEY DIDN'T CALL IT THAT OF COURSE 
ON THE BRIDGE EVERYBODY INCLUDING THE CAPTAIN HAS BEEN SOAKED TO THE SKIN 
NIGEL WAS DELIGHTED 
I WONDER IF SOMEONE WILL TELL ME WHETHER I AM AT THE MOMENT AUDIBLE 
I'M SORRY I SAY THAT BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT 
INTERFERENCE 
AND 
WE SHIPPED IT RIGHT ON THE BRIDGE I SAW EVERYBODY DUCK 
THE MICROPHONE IS DRENCHED IN SEA WATER 
THE CAPTAIN I WON'T SAY HE LOOKS LIKE A DROWNED RAT HE'S MUCH TOO SMART BUT HE'S JOLLY WET 
AND SO IS EVERYBODY ELSE 
MEANWHILE GARY EDGAR WHO'S WITH US ABOARD 
IS DOWN BELOW SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP 
AND HE CAN TALK TO SOME OTHERS 
WHO ARE EXPERIENCING WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING 
WE COULDN'T GET THROUGH 
WHY'S HE INTERVIEWING WITH A PIPE 
LOOK MR. HICKS I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT 
BUT I THINK THE BEST THING TO DO IS SIT DOWN BEFORE WE FALL DOWN 
AND HAND BACK UPSTAIRS TO RICHARD DIMBLEBY 
THAT'S CALLED PASSING THE BUCK 
OH YOU'RE BACK 
WELL I'VE 
POOR NIGEL HE DEMANDED PIZZA CHIPS DOUGHNUTS 
TWELVE CANS OF TIZER AND SOME OF THOSE LITTLE BISCUITS WITH ICING ON TOP 
IT WAS HIS FIRST TIME AT SEA 
HE HADN'T THOUGHT THIS THROUGH 
AS YOU ARE 
WHEN NIGEL TURNED SIXTEEN HE WENT THROUGH HIS SPECCY NERDY PHASE 
HE PITCHED UP A FEW MORE IDEAS STAMP COLLECTING LIVE 
ACNE LIVE 
AND LOOKING THROUGH MY BIG SISTER'S UNDERWEAR DRAWER LIVE 
HERE'S THE ONE THEY WENT FOR THE SKY AT NIGHT LIVE 
SPEAKING TO YOU TONIGHT NOT FROM THE STUDIO 
BUT FROM GEORGE HOLE'S OBSERVATORY NEAR BRIGHTON 
HE'S ONE OF OUR BEST KNOWN MIRROR MAKERS AND INSTRUMENT MAKERS IN GENERAL 
HE'S CONSTRUCTED THIS WONDERFUL TWENTY FOUR INCH REFLECTOR 
BUT BECAUSE THE WEATHER IS SO NOTORIOUSLY UNCERTAIN 
ER WE HAVE ER CO OPERATED WITH THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY AT EDINBURGH 
IF YOU DID STAY UP YOU'D HAVE MISSED BARNACLE WATCH ON THE OTHER SIDE 
ZERO POINT THREE SIX INCH TELESCOPE 
AND WE HAVE IN FACT GOT A CAMERA FIXED ONTO THAT ONE TOO 
YOU KEEP SAYING TELESCOPE IT'S ACTUALLY A CANNON 
IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY PROMISING NOW 
WE DO HOPE THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO GET SOME PICTURES FROM EDINBURGH 
OH YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE 
ONE NIGHT I SAW THEM TOGETHER AND I OPENED MY MOUTH TO SPEAK 
THESE DAYS AMATEUR PERFORMERS HAVE A CLEARLY DEFINED ROLE ON T. V. 
TO BE HELD UP FOR PUBLIC DERISION 
AND RITUAL HUMILIATION BY SHINY RICH PEOPLE 
THEY WAS LAUGHING AND HOLDING HANDS 
BACK IN THE DAYS BEFORE WE REALISED HOW MUCH FUN THIS WAS 
THEY WERE ACTUALLY TAKEN QUITE SERIOUSLY 
THEY WERE STILL RUBBISH THOUGH 
HE WAS A NASTY PIECE OF WORK GONZALEZ WAS HIS NAME 
NOW HERE'S A TREAT 
A VERY NICHE MUSIC GENRE RACIST FOLK 
IT'S A VERY SMALL SECTION IN YOUR RECORD SHOP 
RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR VERY LARGE SECTION ENTITLED SEXIST RAP 
COS I DIDN'T LIKE PORTUGUESE IN GENERAL AND IN PARTICULAR I DIDN'T LIKE HIM 
HOW CAN HE SING THIS RACIST STUFF WHEN HIS PARTNER'S GINGER 
NOW I FOLLOWS HIM HOME TO HIS LODGINGS IN MILLWALL THEREABOUTS 
I FOLLOWS UP AN ALLEY AND I TURNS HIM INSIDE OUT 
WELL I MUTTER JEALOUS OATHS AND THINGS AND I BASHED HIM BLACK AND BLUER 
AND I LIFTED A MANHOLE COVER AND I BUNGED HIM DOWN THE SEWER 
THE GUITARIST IS REGRETTING LETTING HIM SING 
HE NORMALLY PLAYS THE MOUTH ORGAN HE HAD NO IDEA 
SHE MADE MY POOR LIFE HELL 
I MAKE MY BED AND LIE IN THE LIGHT 
WOW SHE'S HAPPY TO BE ON TELLY

THE DRUMMER MADE THEM DRESS LIKE THIS COS HE WAS SIGNING ON 
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO CONDUCT AN INTERVIEW 
THIS IS ONE TECHNIQUE THAT NEVER CAUGHT ON CREEPY 
THAT WAS MORAG MACLEOD AND SHE COMES FROM ABERDEEN 
VERY UNUSUAL TO SEE A GIRL PLAYING A WIND INSTRUMENT 
WELL IT IS RATHER 
WHAT DID THEY SAY AT HOME WHEN YOU BROUGHT HOME AN INSTRUMENT YOU WERE BLOWING ROUND THE HOUSE 
THEY WERE A BIT DUBIOUS AT FIRST 
THAT POOR GIRL CAN FEEL HIS WARM BREATH ON HER FACE

AND THE CLUE FROM ME THIS MAN HAS MORE FACES THAN MOUNT RUSHMORE 
HERE'S A GOOD IDEA 
RICHARD WHITELEY DOESN'T KNOW WHO HIS GUESTS ARE BEFORE INTERVIEWING THEM WITH NO SCRIPT OR RESEARCH 
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG WITH THAT 
WHITEHOUSE WHITEHOUSE

MY NAME'S WHITEHOUSE OH PAUL WHITEHOUSE YES 
I MEAN IT'S FUNNY I ALWAYS I MEAN COMEDY'S MY GAME 
WHEN YOU YOU OBVIOUSLY ACT A GREAT DEAL 
BUT WHEN YOU DO COMEDY AT BENEFITS AND THINGS 
IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT I REMEMBER AT AMNESTY 
I WAS TRYING TO DO A BIT OF COMEDY AND EVERYONE'S THINKING 
WHERE'S STING AND MARK KNOPFLER AND I WAS FEELING VERY FARTY INDEED 
I KNOW YOU LOVE COMEDY ARE WE ALLOWED FARTY ON THE B. B. C. NOW

LIVE ASTRONOMY 
I'M LOOKING ROUND TRYING TO SHIELD MY EYES FROM THE LIGHTS 
WE'VE GOT QUITE A LOT OF LIGHT HERE OF COURSE 
I CAN'T SEE VERY MANY BREAKS AT ALL 
THE MOON IS CLOUDED OUT AND SO IS JUPITER AND SATURN 
BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING MORE WE'LL SAY A WORD ABOUT THIS TELESCOPE 
BECAUSE IT IS RATHER A SPECIAL KIND 
GEORGE WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE PROSPECTS AT THE MOMENT 
I THINK WE'RE NEARLY TOTALLY OBSCURED PATRICK 
I SAW JUPITER A FEW MOMENTS AGO I CAN SEE IT NOW 
IT'S GONE AGAIN IT'S ONE OF THE INFURIATING THINGS ABOUT WHICH WE CAN DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
THEY MAY BE BETTER OFF AT EDINBURGH WE'LL SEE IN A MINUTE OR TWO 
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE 
YEAH OBVIOUSLY COURSE IT IS 
AH BRILLIANT IT'S TEN YEARS YOUNGER 
WELL THAT'S THE REASON HE WASN'T SO CONCERNED ABOUT US SIGNING HIS MONEY HUH 
HE'S INSURED 
PRODUCT PLACEMENT IS WHEN THEY PLACE A PRODUCT LIKE THIS DELICIOUS TUNNOCK'S TEACAKE 
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCENE AND WEAVE IT SEAMLESSLY INTO THE ACTION 
THE KEY WORD BEING SEAMLESSLY 
I THINK GORSKY WAS TELLING THE TRUTH BRADY 
WHAT 
I HAVE A HUNCH THAT THIS CASE HAS BELONGED UNDER THE JURISDICTION 
OF THE HOMICIDE SQUAD FROM THE START 
PLAIN CLOTHES MAN WAS A GROUNDBREAKING DETECTIVE DRAMA SERIES FROM THE FORTIES 
I REPEAT DRAMA SERIES NOT CIGAR COMMERCIAL 
ANY HARD EARNED CASH LEFT BRADY I'D TAKE IT AS IT IS 
I SPENT MY LAST QUARTER ON THESE THREE HARVESTER CIGARS 
REMEMBER NOT A COMMERCIAL 
THANKS YOU'RE WELCOME 
YOU KNOW THIS IS THE BEST BET FOR ANY MAN'S DOUGH WHEN IT COMES TO REAL SMOKING PLEASURE 
RIGHT YOU ARE SERGEANT 
ANY MAN AND ANY TIME 
ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW I THINK THE BEST HARVESTER OF THE DAY IS THE ONE I HAVE AFTER BREAKFAST WITH MY COFFEE 
REMEMBER NOT A COMMERCIAL 
I DISAGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE TIME LIEUTENANT 
FOR ME I LIKE TO DROP INTO THE TWENTY FOURTH DISTRICT CLUB AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK 
SLOUCH DOWN IN ONE OF THOSE EASY CHAIRS LIGHT UP A FINE MELLOW HARVESTER 
THIS IS NOT A COMMERCIAL IT'S A DRAMA SERIES 
THAT'S REAL COMFORT 
I DIDN'T THINK THE CLUB ALLOWED DOGS ON THE FURNITURE BRADY 
JUST POLICE DOGS LIEUTENANT JUST POLICE DOGS 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE RUINING A PERFECTLY GOOD HARVESTER FOR ME 
TURNS OUT THE BAD GUY SMOKES A RIVAL BRAND OF CIGARS THAT STINK 
AND THAT'S HOW HE GETS CAUGHT 
GARY LINEKER TRIED THIS WITH CRISPS ON MATCH OF THE DAY 
ALAN HANSEN REPLIED I GET MINE CHEAPER AT MORRISONS 
ANYTHING ELSE 
LIVE ASTRONOMY 
NOW I'M GOING TO SHIELD MY EYES FROM THE LIGHT AGAIN 
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I CAN SEE ANY BREAK AT ALL 
JUPITER IS OBSCURED AT THE MOMENT 
I CAN'T SEE ONE SINGLE STAR CAN YOU GEORGE 
IF WE CAN SEE ONE STAR WE'LL JUST GET THE TELESCOPE ONTO IT 
AND GIVE YOU AT LEAST A DIRECT PICTURE OF THAT 
NO WE ARE TOTALLY OBSCURED 
WELL THERE'S HOPE YET BECAUSE WE HAVE EXCEPT I CAN SEE ALTAIR CAN YOU 
BUT IT'S GONE AGAIN IT GOES BEFORE YOU CAN GET NEAR IT 
ALTAIR SEEMS TO BE ABOUT THE BEST BET I SUGGEST YOU TURN THE TELESCOPE ONTO ALTAIR 
AND JUST AS SOON AS WE GET ANY KIND OF A PICTURE AT ALL WE CAN FEED IT THROUGH 
ANY LUCK NO I MUST BE ABLE TO SEE IT BEFORE I CAN GET ONTO IT 
OH YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE 
SHE PACKED MY BAGS 
LAST NIGHT PRE FLIGHT 
THIS IS WILLIAM SHATNER DOING HIS OWN UNIQUE INTERPRETATION OF ROCKET MAN BY ELTON JOHN 
AS A KITE BY THEN 
IF YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY YOU WANNA HEAR HIS VERSION OF MY OLD MAN'S A DUSTMAN 
OH MY OLD MAN 
IS A DUSTMAN 
I MISS MY WIFE 
IT'S LONELY OUT IN SPACE 
HE WRINGS OUT EVERY LAST DROP OF EMOTION THAT ELTON NEVER PUT IN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
TIMELESS FLIGHT 
THIS IS A VERY BRAVE PERFORMANCE BY THE ONE AND ONLY WILLIAM SHATNER 
HANG ON THERE'S TWO OF THEM 
AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A LONG LONG TIME 
BEFORE I WORK AGAIN 
BRINGS ME ROUND AGAIN TO FIND 
I'M NOT THE MAN THEY THINK I AM AT HOME 
OH NO NO NO 
I'M A ROCKET MAN 
THIS PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN BLAMED FOR THE LATE SIXTIES ASTRONAUT SHORTAGE 
HIS FUSE UP HERE ALONE 
AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A LONG LONG TIME 
THE AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS IS THEY RECORDED IT LIVE 
TO FIND I'M NOT THE MAN THEY THINK I AM AT HOME 
OH NO NO NO 
I'M A ROCK ET MAN 
HE'S THE ROCK ET MAN 
BURNING OUT HIS FUSE OUT HERE ALONE 
AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A LONG LONG TIME 
GOOD KIRK 
AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A LONG LONG TIME 
BAD KIRK 
AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE 
A LONG LONG TIME 
AND NAUGHTY KIRK 
AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE 
A LONG LONG TIME 
AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE 
A LONG LONG TIME 
LIVE ASTRONOMY 
HELLO ANOTHER MESSAGE FROM EDINBURGH 
WE'VE GOT SATURN NOW AS SEEN FROM EDINBURGH 
SO LET US GO NOW OVER 
BACK TO EDINBURGH AND HAVE A LOOK AT SATURN FROM THERE 
THERE IT IT AND THIS IS A DIRECT VIEW OF SATURN ON DIRECT TELEVISION 
AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME IT EVER HAS BEEN DONE 
COME AND LOOK AT THAT GEORGE I'M LOOKING IT'S VERY VERY GOOD 
THERE IS SATURN WITH ITS SYSTEM OF RINGS 
WILLIAM TELL OVERTURE 
HELP 
SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE BASICALLY EFFECTS 
WITH THE WORD SPECIAL IN FRONT OF THEM 
THIS IS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE WITHOUT THE WORD SPECIAL 
YOU DON'T NEED ME TO EXPLAIN THIS 
IT'S SUPERMAN BUT A DOG 
YOU WILL BE THE FIRST ONE TO TAKE A TRIP TO THE MOON 
WE'LL SHOW THEM RUSSIANS HUH BOSS 
HELP OH 
OH PLEASE 
OH SUPER PUP AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU 
OH BOY 
EVEN DOGS DRIVE LIKE THAT WHEN THEY'RE BEING FILMED 
HE'S ACTUALLY DRIVING THAT QUITE WELL 
THE LETTERS THEY HAD FROM ANIMAL LOVERS ABOUT THAT CRASH 
STUPID ANIMAL LOVERS 
ANIMAL LOVERS 
LONG ARM OF THE LAW 
AHH ISN'T HE WONDERFUL 
WOOF 
YOU READY LET'S DO IT 
AH STAR COPS 
WHAT IS GOING ON 
I'M DYING FOR A DRINK AND I'M BUSTIN' FOR A PEE 
THIS WAS BASICALLY THE BILL ON THE MOON 
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS 
AH OUR HOSTESS 
ALL COP SHOWS HAVE A CHASE SCENE TO RAMP UP THE TENSION AND STAR COPS WAS NO DIFFERENT 
WATCH THIS 
THEY MANAGED TO FIND THE ONLY SETTING 
WHERE A CHASE SEQUENCE COULD BE MADE LESS EXCITING 
THEY CAUGHT UP WITH HIM NINE LIGHT YEARS LATER 
THAT WAS A GREAT EPISODE 
THOSE 
ARE ANIMAL MAN HYBRIDS 
A MAN ANIMAL HYBRID NOT ANOTHER RUSSELL BRAND 
WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON 
IS A MAN ANIMAL HYBRID 
AND THAT'S DIFFERENT HOW THAT'S THE SAME THING 
WITH THE WORDS IN A DIFFERENT ORDER YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A SCIENTIST 
YOU DISGUST ME 
THE FEELING IS QUITE MUTUAL 
SO THEY'VE BOTH LET ONE GO 
MEANWHILE BACK IN THE KITCHEN 
WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE GOT A REASONING CARNIVOROUS ANIMAL 
RATUS SAPIENS 
OOH COLIN 
AS SPECIAL EFFECT GO THIS IS PRETTY SNEAKY 
SEWING RATS TO TROUSER LEGS 
THEY COULD'VE USED VELCRO 
BUT THEY DIDN'T 
TOO EASY 
THEY'LL BE EATING THEIR BREAKFAST OFF THAT IN THE MORNING EURGH 
SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT ANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT SHOWS 
RANDALL AND HOPKIRK 
THE BARON 
THE SAINT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THEY'RE ALL FILMED ON THE SAME DANGEROUS STRETCH OF ROAD 
WITH THE SAME DANGEROUS CAR 
YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT THEY'D PUT A SIGN UP OR SOMETHING 
L. I. I. IVE ASTRONOMY 
CONDITIONS UP THERE HAVE NOW GONE 
MORE OR LESS THE SAME AS THEY ARE HERE 
GEORGE CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING AT ALL VEGA 
CAN YOU SEE VEGA I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I CAN GET ON IT 
RIGHT THE STAR VEGA WHICH IS THE THING WE WANTED TO SHOW YOU 
IT'S A BRIGHT BLUE STAR 
WITH ANY LUCK NOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE TELESCOPE ON IT 
I CAN SEE IT QUITE CLEARLY 
WE JUST HAVE TIME TO SHOW YOU 
BUT OF COURSE THERE'S STILL A LOT OF DRIFTING CLOUD UP THERE 
AND WE CAN'T TELL IF IT WILL BE OBSCURED AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT 
OF COURSE YOU WON'T SEE VEGA LOOKING LARGE 
BECAUSE NO TELESCOPE YET BUILT WILL SHOW US 
IT'S GONE PATRICK HAS IT GONE 
OH NO 
JUST AS I GOT IT ON THE CROSS WIRES IT BLACKED RIGHT OUT 
HOW TYPICAL THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT 
I CAN'T MOVE A TWENTY FOUR INCH TELESCOPE QUICKER THAN THAT 
NO I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T 
IS IT WORTH KEEPING IT THERE 
WELL THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO POINT IT IS THERE I'M AFRAID NOT 
SOAPS ARE LIKE DRAMA WITHOUT THE BUDGET 
OR THE DRAMA 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO FEATURE A SHAPE IN YOUR SOAP OPERA 
MAKE SURE IT'S A SQUARE LIKE ALBERT NOT A TRIANGLE 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT TRIANGLE IT WAS ACTUALLY FILMED AT SEA 
ICE 
THEY DIDN'T USE ACTORS THEY USED STOWAWAYS 
AAH STOP IT 
STOP THAT BELL 
THIS WAS BEFORE YOU COULD CHOOSE YOUR OWN RING TONE HE'D HAVE CRAZY FROG 
IT'S A FRIEND HE WANTS TO TALK 
HE'S GOT THE WRONG SCREWDRIVER 
YOU NEED A PHILLIPS FOR HOSTAGE SITUATIONS 
NOT FLATHEAD FLATHEAD'S CAR THEFTS 
BUT I THOUGHT YOU KNEW THE ANSWER TO THE KEY QUESTION MATT 
THE LADY SENDS FOR THE ENGINEER 
KATE NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY 
IF THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG IN THERE JUST SAY YES 
SAY NO YES 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY APPROPRIATE JUST NOW MR. WARRENDER 
HE'S NEVER MET THEM BEFORE 
HE'S ACTUALLY CHIEF MORALS OFFICER 
I THINK I SHOULD GO AFTER CLARE 
KEVIN IT ISN'T WHAT IT SEEMS 
GOOD GOD PENNY 
I'VE GOT EYES 
CLARE 
WHAT'S WRONG 
SHE'S ACTUALLY GOT SCURVY 
WHICH IS A DEFICIENCY OF VITAMIN C. AND TALENT 
WHAT'S WRONG NOTHING 
ELDORADO WAS BESET WITH PROBLEMS FROM DAY ONE 
THIS IS DAY TWO 
TRINE IT'S NOT FAIR 
BUT DON'T YOU THINK I FEEL THE SAME WAY 
I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU US TOGETHER 
IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY 
BUT NOT FOR MUCH LONGER WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
THERE WAS A LOT MORE SKILL INVOLVED THAN PEOPLE GAVE IT CREDIT FOR 
FOR INSTANCE THIS KID WAS A VENTRILOQUIST 
HE'S DOING HIS LINES AND HERS 
LEAVE IT TO ME I'LL FIX EVERYTHING

AH CROSSROADS 
IT WAS STORY LINES LIKE THIS THAT MADE IT SUCH A SUCCESS 
THE GREAT SPIDER TRIFLE SCARE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY 
HE'S BEEN BUSY HE'S ONLY GOT THREE SPIDERS LEFT 
HE'S GETTING THROUGH TWENTY SPIDERS A DAY 
MRS. MORTIMER IN THE LAST WEEK I'VE MADE A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS 
ABOUT CERTAIN BEHAVIOURS OF PATTERN 
THEY DID HAVE TIME TO RETAKE THAT LINE 
BUT NO ONE COULD BE BOTHERED 
NO GORDON YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT SHE DID IT 
I'M MAKING NO PARTICULAR ACCUSATIONS 
GAY GORDON SOMEBODY'S GOT A GRUDGE AGAINST ME IN THE KITCHEN 
WHAT ON EARTH'S THAT 
SOMETHING AWFUL'S HAPPENED WHAT IS IT 
THE LADY ON TABLE SEVEN'S SCREAMING HER HEAD OFF WHY

WHO'S WITH HER MY MUM IS I'D BETTER GO THROUGH 
MRS. MORTIMER BEFORE YOU GO I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING 
THESE ARE DEAD SPIDERS 
THEY DIDNAE GET THERE OF THEIR OWN ACCORD 
THEY'VE BEEN PLACED THERE DELIBERATELY 
PLACED THERE DELIBERATELY BY SPIDER MAN 
HE WAS ON HOLIDAY IN BIRMINGHAM 
OR SPIDER WOMAN 
OR MAYBE IT WAS SPIDER SPIDER THE EXTRA SPIDERY SPIDER 
WITH THE HUMAN HAND 
WHAT ON EARTH 
IT WAS GAY GORDON ALL ALONG NOBBLING HIS OWN DESSERTS 
GO KATH 
JUST GO 
FORGET YOU EVER SAW IT 
COME ON NOW MEG 
THIS WAS THE CROSSROADS NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE CHRISTMAS SING ALONG 
NOT A LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT SHOW 
IT WAS AN ACTUAL EPISODE OF THE SHOW 
IT WAS ALL FILMED IN THE SNUG BAR AND I LIKE IT 
LIGHT UP THE TREE 
BEFORE MY SPIRIT FALLS AGAIN 
FILL UP THE STOCKING 
WE MAY BE RUSHING THINGS 
BUT DECK THE HALLS AGAIN 
LOOK AT HER SHE LOVES CHRISTMAS

WOAH WOAH WOAH HOLD ON WHAT WAS THAT 
CAROLS AT THE SPINET 
CAROLS AT THE SPINET 
I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF TILL YOU SAID THAT 
YOU'RE MAKING RHYMES UP THAT'S NOT VERY CHRISTMASSY 
YOU'VE RUINED MY CHRISTMAS NOW GO ON SOD OFF 
YES WE NEED A LITTLE CHRISTMAS NOW 
I NEED SOMETHING TO CHEER ME UP NOW 
I WANT LIVE ASTRONOMY 
SO I THINK WHAT WE'D BETTER DO NOW JUST FOR THE NEXT FEW MINUTES 
IS TO POINT THE TELESCOPE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MOON 
SO WHEN WE GET A GLIMMER WE CAN TURN ON TO IT 
IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO TELL 
ONE CAN'T UNFORTUNATELY CONTROL THESE THINGS 
THERE IS DEFINITELY LIGHTENING OVER THERE NOW GEORGE 
IT'S COMING OUT YES THERE IS THE MOON 
NO IT'S GONE AGAIN IT'S GONE 
HOWEVER INFURIATING THERE'S NOTHING ONE CAN DO 
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE 
LET'S SEE YOU PUT A REALLY FAT BUN IN A MUFFIN 
I LIKE MY EXPERTS TO BREEZE IN BE EXPERT AT SOMETHING 
THEN BUGGER OFF SOMETIMES THEY JUST BREEZE IN 
NO YOU CAN GET FAT BUNS IN THE PHILIPS 
THE SUNBEAM AND THE ROWENTA 
BUT ALL THE OTHERS HERE AND ALL THE OTHERS IN THE TEST 
WILL ONLY TAKE NORMAL SLICED BREAD WHAT ABOUT SAFETY 
THIS IS A TOAST EXPERT OR AS YOU KNOW HIM STUDENT 
THAT WAS THE PIFCO THIS WAS THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY CAUGHT FIRE YES 
YES YOU CAN SEE THE SCORCH MARKS 
IN THE MEANTIME IF YOU'VE GOT THAT PIECE OF PAPER READY 
THIS BLOKE REALLY IS AN EXPERT 
AT ONE OF THE MOST BORING THINGS EVER DEVISED 
WHITE ON THE OTHER 
AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE NOAH'S ARK 
I DON'T THINK KATRINA'S FROM OSAKA 
I THINK SHE'S FROM DUNDEE 
TASTED LIKE FISH 
IN A COVERED FOLD 
THERE YOU HAVE MR. AND MRS. NOAH 
LOOKING OUT WAITING FOR THAT DOVE TO COME BACK 
THE BOAT'S A WEE BIT BIG SO JUST FOLD THIS IN HALF 
THERE YOU GO A LITTLE ARK FOR YOUR COCAINE 
YOU HAVE A LITTLE PLATFORM TO REST IT ON AT THE BACK 
THERE YOU HAVE MR. AND MRS. NOAH SAFELY IN THE ARK 
YOU CAN'T SEE THE ANIMALS COS THEY'RE INSIDE 
NO I WANNA SEE THEM 
YES KATRINA'S MADE IT MAGNIFICENT 
LOOK AT THAT HE'S MADE HIMSELF AN ORIGAMI WIG 
NEXT TIME WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS MAGNIFICENT SWAN 
THIS SWAN I WANT YOU PLEASE TO BE VERY READY FOR IT 
HE'S TOUGH ISN'T HE 
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A PIECE OF PAPER READY ABOUT THIS SIZE 
AND FOLD IT INTO A DART SHAPE 
PLEASE 
THIS IS THE ORIGAMI SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS 
AND THERE AND HAVE THAT READY IF YOU CAN 
IF YOU HAVEN'T HAVE THE SQUARE READY 
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO DO LOTS OF REVERSE FOLDS 
NEXT WEEK'S PREPARATIONS ARE 
HAVE A PIECE OF PAPER 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NEXT WEEK 
SO LET'S HAVE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE KIT 
THE BASIC KIT IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR AREAS 
THIS PROGRAMME INSPIRED A LOAD OF BUDDING YOUNG MUSICIANS 
TO WORK AT A CALL CENTRE 
CYMBALS IT MAKES ROCK MUSIC SEEM LESS EXCITING THAN LAW 
THE DRUMS ARE TRADITIONALLY MADE FROM VARYING NUMBERS OF PLYS OF HARDWOOD 
MAPLE BIRCH MAHOGANY ARE ALL COMMONLY USED 
THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE WORKED OUT DIFFERENT WAYS OF ENSURING THE PERFECT ROUNDNESS OF THE SHELL 
WHICH IS VITAL TO THE PROJECTION OF THE SOUND 
THAT'S IT THAT'S ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT DRUMS THERE IS ON EARTH 
FOR ROCK YOU WANT A PUNCHY SOUND 
SO I'VE SET THE PICKUP IN THE MIDDLE 
AND I'VE GOT A LOT OF BASS AND A LOT OF MIDDLE 
AND I HIT THE STRINGS REALLY HARD 
THE DRUMS BIG OPEN SOUND 
LOTS OF CYMBALS AND YOU HIT 'EM HARD ONE TWO THREE 
SADLY THIS GROUP SPLIT UP DUE TO MUSICAL INDIFFERENCES 
SO I HAVE A PLUM OF A HEALTH TIP FOR YOU 
IT'S AN UMEBOSHI PLUM WHICH IS A PLUM 
THAT HAS BEEN PICKLED IN SHISO LEAVES 
AND SEA SALT FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
YOU SUCK ON IT OR YOU CAN PUT IT INTO YOUR WATER 
TO BE HONEST I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE TO START WITH THIS 
IT'S HORRIBLE THE PEOPLE THE PLUMS EVERYTHING 
DO AS I DO AND ATTACH IT TO YOUR TUMMY BUTTONS 
THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE TUMMY BUTTON 
IS THE MOST ABSORBABLE PART OF THE BODY URGH I SAW THAT 
IT HAPPENS THAT I HAVE GOT SCISSORS AND SELLOTAPE 
AND TWO EXTRA PLUMS FOR YOUR TUMMY BUTTONS 
CAN WE COME BACK TO THAT LATER 
HOW DO YOU DO CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON HERE 
IT'S A SORT OF EDUCATIONAL GAME 
THAT I USE IN MY CONFIRMATION CLASS AND SUNDAY SCHOOL 
A FOUR EYED BALDY VICAR WITH A GINGER BEARD 
THAT WRITES BIBLICAL COMPUTER GAMES 
I HADN'T REALLY ASSOCIATED VICARS WITH COMPUTERS BEFORE NOW 
NO MAN HAS EVER MADE GREATER EFFORT TO REPEL THE LADIES 
THESE MAGAZINES THE CHURCH COMPUTER HOW LONG DID IT TAKE 
I HATE TO THINK HUNDREDS OF HOURS 
YES MY WIFE THINKS THAT COMPUTERS ARE THE WORK OF THE DEVIL 
MY WIFE AGREES WITH YOU YOU'RE MARRIED 
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN FERTILISATION IS COMPLETE 
AND THIS CAPSULE'S ABOUT TO RISE UP IN THE AIR 
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GRAB A LIFT 
BACK IN THE EIGHTIES T. V. RAN A VERY TIGHT SHIP 
IF YOU TURNED UP LATE YOU HAD TO PRESENT THE SHOW IN YOUR PANTS 
THE CAPSULES OF THE LIVERWORT DO THE SAME JOB 
THEY MANAGED TO SHRINK DAVID BELLAMY FOR THIS SCENE 
BUT NOT HIS GENITALS I HOPE THIS DOESN'T GO OFF TOO SOON 
WINTER DRAWERS ON 
AND WITH IT ALL THE COLD WEATHER 
AND COLD HANDS AND COLD STEERING WHEELS 
THIS IS MAINLY FOR MEN 
OR TO GIVE IT ITS FULL TITLE MAINLY FOR MEN WITH COLD HANDS 
A WARM STEERING WHEEL SO WE HAVE ONE HERE 
WITH A LEATHER GLOVE AROUND THE WHEEL INSIDE THE GLOVE IS A WIRE 
WHICH IS TAKEN ROUND TILL IT GETS TO ONE OF THE SPARS 
EITHER ONE TAKE THE WIRE BEHIND THE SPAR 
UP TO THE CENTRE HUB AS NEAR AS YOU CAN DRILL A HOLE 
PUT THE WIRE THROUGH TAKE OFF THE HORN CAP 
THERE HAS TO BE AN EASIER WAY OF WARMING UP YOUR STEERING WHEEL 
I USUALLY GET MY WIFE TO DRIVE AROUND FOR AN HOUR BEFORE I GO ANYWHERE 
WHICH FIXES THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE STEERING COLUMN 
JOIN US NEXT WEEK ON MAINLY FOR MEN 
WHEN WE'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO WARM YOUR HANDS 
ON A PAIR OF LADIES' BREASTS 
YOU HAVE WARM HANDS WARM AND SAFE DRIVING 
LIVE ASTRONOMY 
THAT IS THAT I'M AFRAID WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE ANYTHING MORE DIRECT 
WE HAD HOPED TO SHOW YOU JUPITER AND SATURN RATHER MORE CLEARLY 
BUT THAT JUST WASN'T TO BE 
AFTER ALL WE'VE TRIED FOUR DIRECT RECORDINGS NOW 
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WHEN WE HAVEN'T HAD REAL SUCCESS 
ANYHOW YOU HAVE SHOWN SOMETHING 
AND WE HAVE AT LEAST BEEN ABLE TO PUT SATURN DIRECT ON THE SCREEN 
FOR THE FIRST TIME I SHALL JUST CLIMB DOWN ONCE AGAIN 
SO I HOPE THIS HAS INTERESTED YOU 
AND I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN SEEING THIS MAGNIFICENT TELESCOPE 
AND GEORGE HOLE WHO BUILT IT 
FROM BRIGHTON WHERE THE SKY IS NOW COMPLETELY OVERCAST 
GOODNIGHT GOODNIGHT GOODNIGHT PATRICK GOODNIGHT GEORGE 
IF THE SKY HADN'T BEEN COMPLETELY OVERCAST 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MARGINALLY ABOVE MUNDANE 
AND EVERYONE WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT BY THE WEEKEND 
BUT IT WAS CLOUDY AND THEY DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING 
AND THAT MADE IT MUCH MUCH BETTER THERE HAS TO BE A LESSON IN THAT 
IF YOU'RE MAKING A T. V. SHOW DON'T SET OUT TO MAKE IT BAD 
LET IT HAPPEN ORGANICALLY 
ALL YOU NEED IS THE RIGHT NUMBER OF IDIOTS AND BOB'S YOUR UNCLE 
SO NEXT TIME YOU HAVE A RUBBISH IDEA LIKE LETTING THE DOG DRIVE 
OR WIRING UP YOUR STEERING WHEEL TO THE MAINS GO FOR IT 
YOU'LL MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY HAPPY 
AND HAVE NO REGRETS 
THE MEMORY OF GOOD TIMES 
I'LL NEVER FORGET 
GOODBYE 
GOODBYE 
GOODBYE
