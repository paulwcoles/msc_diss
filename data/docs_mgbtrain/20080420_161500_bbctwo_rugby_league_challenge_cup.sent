THESE ARE THE RED HOT FLAMES THEIR 
JOB IS TO ENTERTAIN THE CROWD AND 
HOPEFULLY INSPIRE THEIR SIDE 
SALFORD CITY REDS TO A CHALLENGE 
CUP UPSET L. AM CLEARLY WEARING TOO MANY CLOTHES 
WELCOME TO THE WILLOW THE WILLOWS 
THEY HAVE THE HOTTEST CHEERLEADERS 
OF THE LOT THEY ARE YOUNGER THAN 
THE RED HOT FLAMES THEY ARE RARELY 
THIRTEEN TO EIGHTEEN WHEN THEY GROW UP THEY WILL 
BECOME FLAMES THEY HAVE WON A 
RECENT ACCOLADE FOR THEIR EFFORTS 
THE FANS HAD DRESSED UP AS WELL WE 
ARE LIVE IN SALFORD FOR THE FINAL 
FOURTH ROUND TIE OF THE CARNEGIE 
CHALLENGE CUP THE LEADERS OF 
LABOUR WON AGAINST AL SUPER LEAGUE 
SIDE THE LEAGUE ONE HERE IS THE 
WAKEFIELD TEAM ARRIVING FROM 
YORKSHIRE PLENTY OF FANS COMING 
OVER THE PENNINES AS WELL TO 
SUPPORT THEM IN CHALLENGE CUP 
HISTORY SUPER LEAGUE SIDES HAVE A 
HUGE ADVANTAGE BUT HOME ADVANTAGE 
IS ALL IMPORTANT AND THE SALFORD 
FANS WITH THEIR RED WIGS AND 
COWBOY HATS WILL HELP TO GIVE A 
LITTLE INSPIRATION L. AM JOINED BY 
KEVIN'S INFIELD AND THE BRADFORD 
COACH STEVE MCNAMARA THEY HAVE 
BOTH SEEN THEIR SIDES SAFELY 
THROUGH TO THE FIFTH ROUND 
WE HAVE JUST ONE MORE MATCH TO GO 
AND THIS IS IT COULD IT BE AN 
UPSET WHAT DO YOU THINK 
ALL THE 
TIES THIS WEEKEND HAVE GONE TO 
SCRIPT I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE 
SCRIPT WILL BE TODAY ON ONE HAND 
A SUPER LEAGUE SIDE STATISTICS 
SHOW THE SUPER LEAGUE SIDE SHOULD 
WIN BUT THEY ARE BESET WITH 
INJURIES AND PLAYING AWAY FROM HOME 
THEY ARE PLAYING THE BEST SIDE IN 
THE FIRST DIVISION HE WOULD LIKE 
TO THINK THE SUPER LEAGUE SIDE 
WOULD COME THROUGH STRONG YOU 
WOULD LIKE THING THE MOMENTUM OF 
THE TEAM IS PARTLY ABOUT TACTICS 
AND CONFIDENCE BUT ALSO ABOUT 
INJURIES 
THEY WILL BE DISRUPTED L. INJURIES WATCH THEM PLAY LAST WEEK AGAINST 
HUDDERSFIELD AND THERE ARE A LOT OF 
YOUNG GUYS WHO PLAYED GREAT IT IS 
A REALLY TOUGH ONE TO CALL SALFORD 
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE HOPEFULLY 
FOR WAKEFIELD THE YOUNG GUYS CAN 
DO A JOB 
WE ARE HOPING THIS MATCH 
WILL BE EXCITING AND POSSIBLY CAUSE 
A SHOCK WE KNOW ALL OF THE TEAMS 
THROUGH TO THE FIFTH ROUND APART 
FROM THE ONE THAT WILL EMERGE FROM 
THIS MATCH BEWARE THE BIG MAN IN 
THE BASEBALL CAP SHAUN MCRAE HAS 
WON THE CHALLENGE CUP TWICE WITH SAINT 
HELENS IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN HE IS ONE 
OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED COACHES IN 
THE GAME BUT EVEN HE COULD NOT 
PREVENT SALFORD BEING RELEGATED 
LAST SEASON THEIR SIDES ARE BEING 
SET ON SUPER LEAGUE AGAIN THE 
EVERGREEN ROBBIE PAUL IS CRUCIAL TO 
THEIR SUCCESS WAKEFIELD'S COACH 
JOHN KEAR IS THE KING OF THE BIG 
UPSET HE FAMOUSLY FLEW HIS 
SHEFFIELD EAGLES OVER WIGAN TEN 
YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT 
SPORTING SHOCKS HE DID IT AGAIN 
WITH HULL WHEN THEY BEAT LEEDS ONE 
OF THE PLAYERS STARRING THAT DAY 
WAS DANNY BROUGH NOW A KEY FIGURE 
IN THE WAKEFIELD TEAM FOR SUB HE 
HAS FORGED A GREAT PARTNERSHIP WITH 
JAMIE ROONEY HELPING THEM TO EIGHT 
GREAT START IN SUPER LEAGUE 
WAKEFIELD TEAM UP 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE PLAYERS 
ABOUT COMPLACENCY 
I AM NOT SURE 
JOHN WILL HAVE TO DO THAT TODAY 
THEY WILL UNDERSTAND THE TASK IN 
FRONT OF THEM WE PLAYED CASTLEFORD 
LAST YEAR AT A SIMILAR STAGE AND 
THEY WERE THE STAND OUTSIDE IN THE 
COMPETITION VERY DIFFICULT 
STAND OUT SIDE THEY CERTAINLY WILL 
NOT WANT TO BE THE SIDE THAT GETS 
EMBARRASSED PROBABLY THE WRONG 
WORD BUT GETS KNOCKED OUT BY A 
FIRST DIVISION SIDE 
THIS IS THE 
REASON THAT SALFORD ARE DIFFICULT 
THEY ARE UNBEATEN IN THEIR LAST 
EIGHT MATCHES THE RESULT AGAINST A 
WITNESS WAS TOUGH 
THE DRAW WILL 
STAND THEM IN GOOD STEAD THE 
CONDITIONS WILL BE A BIT WET IT 
WILL BE A TIGHT GAME THEY CAN 
STICK IN TIGHT GAMES AND I AM SURE 
THEIR MONEY BACK TODAY THEY WILL 
NEED TO THAT TODAY 
IN ALL 
COMPETITIONS THEY AVERAGE FIFTY TWO 
POINTS PER MATCH WHICH IS 
EXTRAORDINARY WE CANNOT FULLY 
EXPECT A HIGH SCORING GAME 
HER THE 
CONDITIONS MAY DICTATE THAT THEY 
HAVE HAD AT THEIR OWN WAY ALL YEAR 
APART FROM LAST WEEK THEY HAD A 
REALLY TOUGH GAME LAST WEEK IF 
THEY EVER NEEDED ONE IT WAS LAST 
WEEK LEADING INTO A SUPER LEAGUE 
GAME 
IT IS LUCKY THEY GET ON GAME BECAUSE THAT IS A FAIRLY TIGHT 
DRESS AND WON HERE IS THE MAN 
PLOTTING THE UPSET SHAUN MCRAE 
YOU'RE A TOP OF THAT THE COMET IN 
PRIME FORM YOU'LL NEVER GET 
BETTER CHANCE TO CAUSE AN UPSET 
TOP OF THE LEAK IN PRIME FORM 
THEY ARE A VERY WELL DRILLED SIDE 
THE MAGIC OF THE CUP CONTINUES IN 
ROUND FOUR AND WE WOULD LIKE TO BE 
THERE IN ROUND FIVE DESPITE DESPITE RELEGATION LAST SEASON THERE IS A 
FEEL GOOD FACTOR IN SALFORD 
WE ARE 
PLAYING WITH A LOT OF CONFIDENCE 
THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS 
HAPPENING A NEW STADIUM BEING 
BUILT A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING IN 
THE COMMUNITY ON THE FIELD IT IS 
VERY GOOD IT FEELS LIKE A NEW ERA 
IT WOULD BE NICE TO GET A RUN IN 
THE CUP WE ARE UNDER NO ILLUSIONS 
IT IS A VERY TOUGH GAME TODAY YOU YOU HAVE A MAN IN YOUR RANKS WHO KNOWS 
A BIT ABOUT THE CHALLENGE CUP WHAT 
DOES ROBBIE PAUL BRING TO YOUR 
SIDE 
HE BRINGS LEADERSHIP AND SIDE EXPERIENCE HE IS A MATCH WINNER 
HE CAN HOPEFULLY KEEP US COMPOSED 
HE HAD FULLY WILL KEEP UP COME UP 
WITH SOMETHING TO IGNITE THE TEAM 
IT IS HIS AURA AS A PLAYER AS A 
PERK AT AND A PERSON HE BRINGS 
THE BEST OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE 
WHAT ABOUT ROBBIE'S ORA CAN YOU 
FEEL THAT HE HAS SOMETHING EXTRA 
WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING AGAINST HIM 
THE LAST THING SEAN MCRAE SAID THEN 
HE HAS AN AND YOU SEE HIM ABOUT TEN 
IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS FIFTEEN YEAR OLD 
PLAYING HE IS UP AGAINST RICHARD 
MYLER IT TODAY THINK IT WILL BE 
A GREAT DAY FOR THEM 
WHAT ARE THE 
EXTRA THINGS THAT HE BRINGS IS HE 
CONSTANTLY TALKING TO THE PLAYERS 
IS HE CONSOLING THEM IF THEY 
NEEDED 
ANYBODY WHO 
KNOWS ROBBIE NEEDED KNOWS HE LOVES TO CHAT IT IS THE 
ENERGY HE BRINGS TO THE REST OF THE 
SIDE THAT HELPS THE HIM ALONG HE 
IS CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT CHARACTER 
HE LOVES RUGBY LEAGUE HE WAS 
INVOLVED AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE AND 
CAPTAIN SIDES AT SUCH AN EARLY AGE 
HIS COMBINATION WITH RICHARD MYLER 
COULD BE A BIG TURNING POINT FOR 
THEM HE BRINGS SOMETHING SPECIAL 
HE IS NOT AFRAID OF TAKING ON SUPER 
LEAGUE SIDES BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT 
HE IS USED TO LET'S HAVE LOOK AT 
WAKEFIELD'S RECENT FORM THEY HAVE 
WON THEIR LAST TWO IT WAS A BIT 
SHAKY BEFORE THEM BOTH OF YOU HAVE 
COME UP AGAINST THEM LEEDS BEAT 
THEM 
WE HAD A NIGHT WHERE WE WERE THEM RED HOT THEY HAD BEEN BEEN SOME 
GOOD FORM SINCE THE LAST OF TWO 
WERE BIG WINS FOR THEM A GREAT WIN 
AGAINST HUDDERSFIELD WITH TEN OR ELEVEN 
INJURIES IT SHOWS THE DEPTH OF THE 
SQUAD AND THAT THE YOUNG GUYS ARE 
DOING A GREAT JOB 
THE MAN WHO 
ENGINEERED THE BIG CUP UPSETS OF 
OUR TIME WITH SHEFFIELD EAGLES AND 
HULL IS NOW THE WAKEFIELD COACH HE 
IS NOT THE BIGGEST OF MEN BUT HE 
HAS A BIG MATCH TEMPERAMENT HE 
KNOWS WHAT TO SAY 
I GUESS YOU KNOW WHY WE ARE HERE 
THERE IS CHANCE OF AN UPSET WHAT 
DO YOU DO TO MAKE SURE WAKEFIELD 
ARE NOT A STATISTIC IN THE 
CHALLENGE CUP 
WE COME HERE AND 
PERFORM TO OUR BEST WE HAD 
PRACTISED REALLY WELL THIS WEEK IN 
SPITE OF OUR INJURY PROBLEMS WE 
ARE VERY CONFIDENT 
YOU HAVE A 
SPECIAL AFFINITY WITH THIS 
COMPETITION DO YOU GET A TINGLE 
DOWN THE SPINE WHEN IT COMES 
AROUND 
SHAUN MCRAE HAS A GREAT AROUND HISTORY AS WELL WE NOW IT WILL BE 
TOUGH WE KNOW THEY ARE THE BEST 
FULL TIME TEAM OUTSIDE SUPER LEAGUE 
WE KNOW WE HAVE A CHALLENGE ON OUR 
HANDS BUT WE ARE READY 
YOU HAVE 
TEN OR ELEVEN PLAYERS OUT WHAT IS GOING 
ON 
IT IS JUST PART OF THE GAME ON THEY ARE HIGHLY TUNED ATHLETES AND 
THE COLLISIONS ARE VERY INTENSE NOW 
THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED YOU CAN 
FOCUS ON THE NEGATIVE THE INJURIES 
OR LOOK AT THE POSITIVES 
YOU SHED 
AT CHALLENGE CUP SUCCESS WITH DANNY 
BROUGH WHAT 
HE BRING TO THE 
SIDE 
HE HAS A GREAT KICKING GAME SIDE IT IS ABOUT ALL SEVENTEEN PLAYERS LOW WE 
HAVE YOUNG JAY PITTS STARTING FOR 
THE FIRST TIME L. AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT 
L. AM EXCITED 
ABOUT JAMIE 
ROONEY AS WELL IT IS NOT JUST THE 
DANNY BROUGH SHOW IT IS THE 
WAKEFIELD TRINITY WILDCATS SHOW 
JOHN KEAR EMPHASISING THE TEAM 
SPIRIT BUT THIS MAN IS ABSOLUTELY 
CRUCIAL DANNY BROUGH HE DOES HAVE 
AN AMAZING ALL ROUND GAME HE IS 
ONLY TWENTY FIVE 
HE IS A YOUNG BOY A 
REALLY CHEEKY CHAP A TYPICAL 
SCRUM HALF HE PUSHES AND PULLS THE 
SIDE AROUND THE PARK AND TELLS THE 
REFEREE WHAT TO DO FOR SOME HE HAS 
A SPECIAL HABIT OF COMING UP WITH A 
SPECIAL PLAY AT THE RIGHT TIME 
THAT IS GENERALLY HIS KICKING GAME 
WE CAN SEE SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT 
FROM THE GAME LAST WEEK AGAINST 
HUDDERSFIELD YOU MAY NOT 
APPRECIATE HIS HAIRSTYLE BUT YOU 
HAVE TO GO FOR HIS SPEED OF THOUGHT 
HE SHOWS DIFFERENT PARTS OF HIS 
GAME HE IS KEEN TO DO THE HARD 
WORK HIS KICKING GAME IS 
OUTSTANDING HE IS PROBABLY THE 
BEST KICKER OF THE BALL IN SUPER 
LEAGUE HE HAS A GREAT LEFT FOOT 
HE HAS A RUGBY BRAIN AS WELL THERE THERE IS THE WAKEFIELD BUFF DRESSING 
ROOM JOHN KEAR TRYING NOT TO LET 
HIM GET TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO MAKE 
SURE THE WHOLE TEAM ARE APPRECIATED 
YOU CAN SEE THE SALFORD TEAM WITH 
THEIR ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER THEY 
KNOW THE SIZE OF THE TASK AHEAD OF 
THEM AS FAR AS THE STATISTICS GO 
THIS IS A WAKEFIELD'S GAME TO LOSE 
THEY REALLY SHOULD WIN EXACTLY EXACTLY SALFORD NEED TO PERFORM AT THEIR 
VERY BEST THEY PROBABLY PICKED THE 
STRONGER SEVENTEEN FOR STUNNED IT IS A 
MASSIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO PUT 
A STAMP ON IT AND GET THE FRANCHISE 
TO GET BACK IN SUPER LEAGUE THEY 
RUB AGAINST AN INJURY HIT A 
WAKEFIELD SIDE L. AM SURE THEY ARE 
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS ONE 
THEY ARE NEARLY AT FOUR STRENGTH 
SALFORD 
NEARLY AT FULL STRENGTH SALFORD IF THEY PLAY REALLY WELL AND 
WAKEFIELD ARE A LITTLE BIT DOWN 
THEY COULD BE A SHOCK IT IS 
DEFINITELY THE MOST INTERESTING TIE 
OF THE COMPETITION NO DISRESPECT 
TO ANY OF THE OTHER GAMES BUT THIS 
IS THE ONE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT 
IF YOU WERE GONNA HAVE FIVE ON THE 
RESULT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY 
I WOULD 
SAY WAKEFIELD WOULD WIN BUT I 
WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF SALFORD 
DO 
CLEARLY NOT A BETTING MAN LET'S 
JOIN OUR COMMENTARY TEAM 
THIS IS AN OLD SCHOOL CHALLENGE CUP 
TIE AGAIN THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT 
THE UNDERDOG TO SINK ITS TEETH INTO 
SALFORD HAVE REAL CHANCE AND 
HERE AT HIS ONE OF THE REASONS BIG 
ENTRANCE BIG NOISE BIG OCCASION 
FIRST ENTRY INTO THE CHALLENGE CUP 
THIS SEASON FOR THE SUPER LEAGUE 
SIDES AND WAKEFIELD ARE THERE TO BE 
SHOT AT TO TODAY THEIR COACH JOHN 
KEAR KNOWS THAT ROBBIE PAUL MIGHT 
BE SPENDING MORE AND MORE TIME ON 
T. V. SO DOES IT THESE DAYS BUT STILL 
HAS THE 
ABILITY TO SPARKLE IN A 
GAME LIKE THIS HE IS PARTNERED 
TODAY IN THE HEARTS BY A YOUNGSTER 
NEARLY HALF HIS AGE RICHIE MYLER 
TIPPED FOR BIG THINGS OUTCOME THE 
HOOKER IS STILL A TOP FLIGHT 
PERFORMER AL CAR WAKEFIELD ARE 
MISSING TEN PLAYERS THROUGH INJURY THERE ARE PLENTY OF GROUND AND 
CRIME IN THAT BACK TO BIBEY 
TWO TIME CUP WINNER ALL OF THOSE 
PLAYERS WHO ARE ON THE BENCH TODAY 
WILL BE AVAILABLE AT SOME STAGE THE REFEREE IS ASHLEY CLIMATE 
BASED IN ENGLAND BUT HE DOES HAVE 
THE AUSTRALIAN ACCENT KIND IT 
IS A MATCH THAT COULD GIVE US 
ANYTHING WAKEFIELD ARE THE 
FAVOURITES THEY WON AT 
HUDDERSFIELD LAST WEEK THEY ARE 
MISSING SO MANY BUT THEY PLAYED 
WELL AGAINST HUDDERSFIELD BUT HER 
SALFORD THEY WILL WANT TO BLOODY 
NOSES HERE TODAY 
THEY WILL WANT TO 
MAKE IT EXTREMELY TOUGH FOR THE 
WAKEFIELD BOYS WITH CONDITIONS AS 
THEY ARE THE KICKING GAME WILL BE 
CRUCIAL THE TO WAKEFIELD BOYS 
THEY ARE TO GREAT KICKERS ROONEY 
AND THE KICK DOWNFIELD IS FROM ROBBIE 
PAUL IT IS TRAPPED BY GLEESON A A LITTLE UNCERTAINTY BY THE WAKEFIELD 
BOYS THEY HAVE SO MANY PLAYERS MISSING 
AT THE MOMENT BRAD DREW PAUL 
REILLY NOT JUST PLAYERS MISSING 
BUT BIG PLAYERS AS WELL 
INFLUENTIAL FIGURES ON THE FIELD YOU WOULD EXPECT THE ENTHUSIASM 
LEVELS FROM SALFORD TO BE ONE HUNDRED PER 
CENT SAID THE FOR THE OPENING HALF 
IT MAY BE QUESTION OF FITNESS AS 
AGAIN GOES ON 
THEY ARE PLAYING A 
VERY QUICK TEMPO BROUGH'S KICK 
THAT HAS ROLLED OUT OF PLAY NOT A 
TERRIBLE END TO THE SIX BECAUSE AT 
WAKEFIELD'S DEPENDS ARE ABLE TO 
REALISE THEMSELVES AND SALFORD HAVE 
SOME HARD YARDS IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
JUDGE THIS L. AM NOT REALLY SURE 
WHO YOU WOULD BACK BULL THE WINDOW 
WAS WITH SALFORD IT WILL BE TAKEN FORWARD BY PHILIP ROBBIE PAUL WITH A DUMMY RUN WHEN BILL'S DEFENCE IS WORKING HARD 
THEY HAVE LIMITED A NUMBER OF YARDS 
THAT SALFORD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE 
ALKER HAS BEEN KICKING IT OUT A 
SIGN OF CONFIDENCE WHEN A WIN AT 
CHOOSES TO PASS SO DEEP IN HIS OWN 
HALF LOOKING FOR THE OPTION GRIX AGAIN HE IS PLAYING IN HIS 
SIXTH POSITION FOR SIX GAMES SCOTT 
GRIX HE IS MOVING AROUND BUT DOES 
THE JOB BIBEY IS AN UNLIKELY WINNER OF TO 
CHALLENGE MEDALS THERE IS NOBODY 
DENYING THE GLITTERING ARRAY ON HIS 
SIDEBOARD ROONEY WITH LITTLE KICK HE COMES FITZPATRICK BALLARD'S ATTEMPTED PASS HAS 
FIZZLED OUT 
HE GOT HIS ANGLES 
WHITE RIGHT GOOD PLAY BY 
FITZPATRICK GETS AWAY FROM THE 
TACKLE AND HE IS AWAY HE KNOWS 
WHETHER WINGER IS DANNY BROUGH HAS 
GOT HIS ANGLES RIGHT HE COME HEARS 
ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IT WAS A 
GREAT TRY SAVING TACKLE GOT ALL 
THE TACT ANGLES RIGHT FANTASTIC PLAY BOTH THE ATTACK AND 
DEFENCE IT IS LIGHTNING CHAT 
START TO THIS CHALLENGE CUP TIE 
JUST WHAT WE NEEDED AN EXPECTED THE REFEREE SPOTTED THAT AND HAS 
GIVEN THE PENALTY WAKEFIELD'S WAY 
CLEAR HIGH SHOT ANDY BALLARD HAS CERTAINLY BEEN 
INVOLVED ONLY ON 
IT WAS ALL ABOUT 
TECHNIQUE WASN'T IT 
YEAH HE WILL 
HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT 
WAKEFIELD HAVE CHEAP START WHAT 
A WASTE 
POOR POOR PLAY ROONEY 
PUTS HIS HAND UP UNFORGIVABLE UNFORGIVABLE ISN'T IT YEAH HE 
WAS ON THE LINE AS WELL SO IT WAS AN EASY FLASH PLAY 
PUT A BIT 
OF PRESSURE ON HIS SIDE HERE THEY WERE OFFSIDE WAKEFIELD THE 
REFEREE WAS LOOKING FOR THE 
ADVANTAGE DID NOT SEE ONE SO HAS 
GIVEN A PENALTY TO SELL THAT HERE 
IN A VERY INVITING POSITION THEY THEY WILL TAKE THE POINTS 
IT IS A NEW 
RULE THIS YEAR THAT BOTH FEET HAVE 
TO BE BEHIND THE LINE BUT THE 
REFEREE DECIDES IT IS TEN YARDS AWAY 
FROM WHETHER PLAYED BALL IS PLAYED 
AND IN THE SUPER LEAGUE THEY ARE 
FINDING DIFFICULT TO COPE WITH THE 
REFEREE'S ARE HAVING A FIELD DAY 
THAT EXTRA YARD MAKES A BIG 
DIFFERENCE 
A CHANCE 
FOR TO HERE DIFFERENCE FOR ANDY BALLARD MIGHT LOOK A LITTLE OLDER BUT HE IS ONLY TWENTY ONE A PROLIFIC POINTS SCORER AS WELL HE HAS FOUND THE TARGET WITH THAT 
ONE TOO SALFORD HAVE THE EARLY 
LEAD HERE TIMES OF CONCERN FOR 
JOHN KEAR IT IS A SIDE FROM 
NATIONAL LEAGUE ONE WHO ARE LEADING 
THE SUPER LEAGUE TEAM BY TWO POINTS 
AT TWENTY 
DESERVEDLY SO TWO NIL 
IT 
AT TWENTY IT IS A MEASURE OF THE KIND OF 
MOUNTAIN SALFORD HAVE DECLINED TO 
GO FOR TO DIE BEFORE THIS ROUND 
OF MATCHES THEY HAVE BEEN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR CUP 
TIES BETWEEN SUPER LEAGUE TIES 
SIDES AND THE LEAGUE SIZE AND OF 
THEM ONLY ON EIGHT OCCASIONS HAVE 
THE NATIONAL LEAGUE SIDE ACTUALLY 
WON THE GAME UP IN RUGBY LEAGUE 
THERE IS BIT OF A BIG ADVANTAGE 
TO BE DRAWN FROM BEING ONE OF THE 
TOP FLIGHT TEAMS ISN'T THERE NOT A GOOD PASS FROM PAUL FITZPATRICK DID WELL TO RECOVER GRIX DID REALLY WELL THERE THEY 
GOT THEMSELVES OUT OF JAIL LITTLE 
THERE SALFORD 
THREE PLAYERS 
BEARING DOWN ON HIM HE HAD GOOD 
HEIGHT ON THE BALL THIS IS OBST DAUGHTER BUT GIVING THE PASS AWAY 
TO GO RATHER SOLIDLY ROONEY WILL 
KEEP AWAY FROM DUMMY HALF AGAIN AND 
GIVES SOME WORK TO DO FOR 
FITZPATRICK THAT WAS VERY WELL 
JUDGED KICK AND MARTIN WAS UP THERE 
QUICKLY TO MAKE THE TACKLE VERY VERY GOOD KICK BY ROONEY SUPERB KICK 
PERFECT WEIGHT ALREADY IN THIS GAME WE HAVE SEEN 
AT SALFORD STRUGGLING MAYBE TO 
FIND THE YARDS DOWN THE MIDDLE THE THE WAKEFIELD FORWARDS ARE MAKING THE 
YARDAGE VERY COMFORTABLE FOUR 
ROONEY IN THE KICKING GAME SCOTT GRIX IS A VERY TALENTED PLAYER DANNY BROUGH WANTS TO GET ON WITH THIS GOLDEN WAKEFIELD HAVE MADE DECENT PROGRESS 
HERE INSIDE THE SALFORD HER HALF 
MORE TRIES TO DRIVE HOME THE 
ADVANTAGE MOORE TACKLE SIX IS NEXT OR IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN HAD THEY NOT HELD ON TO 
LONG IN THE TACKLE AND GIVEN AWAY A 
RATHER CHEAP PENALTY AGAIN G. G. PENALTY ON THE LAST TACKLE CHEAP DANNY BROUGH HAS ALREADY INDICATED 
HE WANTS TO GO FOR GOAL SEEKING 
PARITY IN THE GAME AGAIN SHAUN SHAUN MCRAE WILL BE FURIOUS ON THE LAST 
TACKLE 
THERE IS A MESSAGE FOR TACKLE SOMEONE DANNY BROUGH IS LOOK USED TO 
KICKING UNDER PRESSURE IN THE CUP 
FINAL IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHEN HULL WON IT AND 
HOW HE WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE 
TEAM HE KICKED THE CONVERSION HE 
MADE SURE OF THE VICTORY THAT WAS A LITTLE LESS PRESSURE 
BUT NONE THE LESS SUCCESSFUL IT IS 
ALL SQUARE AGAIN AT TWO POINTS 
APIECE KARL FITZPATRICK IS HAPPY TO BE 
PLAYING TODAY I'M SURE HIS SEASON 
LAST YEAR WAS RUN BY AN ANKLE 
INJURY WHEN HE INJURED HIS SHOULDER 
IN THE FIRST LEAGUE MATCH OF THIS 
SEASON IT BASES FIRST GAME BACK 
TODAY HE WILL BE HAPPY TO PULL ON 
THE SHIRTS AND HOPING TO BE INJURY 
FREE TODAY I'M SURE WAKEFIELD ARE DOING THE HARD YARDS 
TO GET THEMSELVES OUT OF THEIR OWN 
TERRITORY SALFORD WILL BE ANXIOUS 
THAT THEY DO NOT GIVE PENALTIES 
AWAY HERE MAKE IT HARD AND MAKE IT 
TOUGH BUT KEEP IT CLEAN GREAT TACKLE IT WAS RICHARD MYLER AGAIN DID NOT PANIC THEN BROUGH WHEN 
THEY CLOSED THE SPACE ON HIM PUT 
THE KICK AWAY 
HE WILL BE PLAYING 
FOR SCOTLAND IN THE WORLD CUP AT 
THE END OF THE YEAR YOU CAN SEE 
THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THAT ON B. B. C. 
TELEVISION I AM SURE THE ENGLAND 
COACH MIGHT BE CASTING AN EYE HIS 
WAY AND WISHED HE HAD PUT HIS HAND 
UP TO PLAY FOR ENGLAND BECAUSE 
THERE IS AS A BACK UP SCRUM HALF 
WHO WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE HOLDING DOWN DUNCAN MACGILLIVRAY THAT IS THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN SUPER LEAGUE AND NATIONAL 
LEAGUE THE SPEED WITH WHICH 
PLAYERS GET OFF THE TACKLE AND GET 
ON WITH THE GAME 
SPEED OF 
EVERYTHING SPEED OF THOUGHT AS 
WELL WAKEFIELD'S DEFENCE IS NICE AND EFFICIENT FOR THE TIME BEING A PROP FORWARD CRAIG STAPLETON 
GOT BACK TO MAKE THE TACKLE VERY VERY GOOD TACKLE SALFORD WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE LAST TACKLE TONY MARTIN IS A CENTRE OF REAL 
CLASS BUT HE CAN'T FIND A WAY 
THROUGH THE REFEREE HAS DECIDED THAT THERE 
IS A PENALTY FOR WAKEFIELD OFFSIDE 
OFFSIDE THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT 
KICK AT GOAL L. DON'T THINK THEY WILL GO FOR IT WELL WHAT A GREAT TACKLE FROM FITZPATRICK FANTASTIC BIBEY COULD NOT KEEP HOLD KNOCK ON 
SALFORD'S DEFENCE ESCAPES THEY THEY WERE VERY LUCKY THERE IT OPENED UP 
SO EASILY A CHANGE OF ANGLE THIS 
IS A GREAT TACKLE HE HAS GOT TO GO 
HIGH HE JUST GETS HIS BODY 
UNDERNEATH AND HOLDS THE BALL UP SALFORD HAVE BIG BIG PLANS THEY 
WILL MOVE TO A STADIUM DOWN THE 
ROAD THEY HOPE PARTLY THAT AND 
PARTLY THEIR PLANS ON THE FIELD 
WILL GIVE THEM A LICENCE FOR SUPER 
LEAGUE NEXT YEAR IT COULD RELIVED 
AT THEIR PROFILE A GOOD CUP RUN 
REALLY LIFT THIS TIME WAKEFIELD ARE A LITTLE 
RELIEVED TO COME AWAY WITH 
POSSESSION 
YOU HAVE TO CONTROL POSSESSION THINGS ON THE LAST TACKLE NO ONE 
HAS DOMINATED THE KICKING GAME AT 
THE END AGAIN GREAT OPENING BY 
SALFORD THEY CUT THE WEIGHT HERE 
DEFENCE TO PIECES AGAIN JUST RAN 
OUT OF SUPPORT THE WAKEFIELD 
DEFENCE 
IT IS A TERRIFIC GAME THE DEFENCE THE SCRAMBLED DEFENCE HAS BEEN VERY 
IMPRESSIVE ESPECIALLY FROM 
WAKEFIELD LET'S HEAR FROM DAMIEN JOHNSON ON 
THE TOUCHLINE 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH 
THE START YOUR SIDE HAS MADE VERY VERY MUCH WE ARE STAYING COMPOSED AND 
WORKING HARD 
A TERRIFIC DEFENSIVE 
EFFORT FROM KARL FITZPATRICK HE HE PUT HIS BODY ON THE LINE AND GOT 
THE RESULT 
THANK YOU KARL KARL FITZPATRICK IS ONE OF SEVERAL 
PLAYERS IN THE SALFORD SIDE WHO YOU 
THINK COULD STILL BE PLAYING IN 
SUPER LEAGUE THIS YEAR SHOWED 
GREAT LOYALTY TO SALFORD TO TRY TO 
GET THEM BACK WHERE THEY FEEL THEY 
BELONG OLIVER WILKES LOST THE BALL HIS 
FIRST TOUCH OF THE GAME AND HE HAS 
GIVEN POSSESSION BACK TO SALFORD MOST OF 
THE GAME HAS BEEN PLAYED ON THE HALFWAY LINE NOT MANY 
ATTACKING OPPORTUNITIES FROM INSIDE 
THE TWENTY JAY PITTS THE TEENAGER WAS AROUND ALKER'S SHOULDERS QUICKLY AGAIN NOT THE BEST KICK I DON'T 
THINK THE COMMUNICATION WAS VERY 
GOOD THEY DIDN'T REALLY CHASE IT ROONEY STEPPED AWAY FROM THEM ALL 
AND SCORED A REALLY EYE CATCHING 
TRY IT IS THE FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF 
THE AFTERNOON IT IS JAMIE ROONEY 
A VERY GOOD BREAK GOOD SUPPORT 
LOVELY STEP HE IS AWAY JUST WATCH 
THE SUPPORT ROONEY DOES NOT PANIC 
AGAIN GOOD DEFENCE BUT HE KEEPS 
HIS HEAD GOOD TRY 
HE HAS GOT A 
BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE DESPITE THE 
EFFORTS OF THOSE DEFENDERS HE 
KNOWS HE'S GONNA MAKE IT TO THE 
LINE SAFE AS YOU LIKE WAKEFIELD JUST 
BEGIN TO PRESS HOME THEIR ADVANTAGE 
AGAIN HE FENCED THIS MAN OFF JUST 
WATCH THE SUPPORT COMING THROUGH 
HE WAITS AND WEIGHTS AND WEIGHTS 
LOVELY BALL ROONEY AND SPOTS THE 
LINE AND JUST GOES FOR IT 
HE WAS 
WATCHING HIMSELF ON THE TELLY 
THERE IS A BIG SCREEN AT THE 
WILLOWS WHICH JAMIE ROONEY HAD A 
BEADY EYE ON TO SEE HOW GOOD HIS 
TRY LOOKED L. AM SURE HE WILL AGREE 
IT LOOKED QUITE FLASHY YOU HAVE TO 
TAKE YOUR HAT OFF TO THE SALFORD 
DEFENDERS THERE THEY TRACKED BACK 
AND TRACKED BACK BUT COULD NOT 
QUITE MAKE THE TACKLES COUNT THE THE DEFENCE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD BY BOTH 
SIDES IN THE INITIAL FIRST LINE 
DEFENCE THEY HAVE BEEN CAUGHT A 
COUPLE OF TIMES KEVIN SINFIELD IS WITH US TODAY 
THE LEEDS SKIPPER HOW HAVE YOU 
SEEN IT SO FAR 
WAKEFIELD ARE JUST 
STARTING TO GET TO GRIPS WITH THIS 
GAME THE KICKING GAME FROM ROONEY 
HAS BEEN FANTASTIC SALFORD HAVE 
HAD A COUPLE OF CHANCES ATKINS HAS GOT THEIR THERE WAS A 
HUGE GAP IN THAT SALFORD DEFENCE 
DANNY BROUGH DARTED INTO IT WHEN 
IT CLOSED HE FOUND THE SUPPORT OF 
THE VERY MUSCULAR RYAN ATKINS IT 
IS THE SECOND TRY IN ALMOST AS MANY 
MINUTES 
AGAIN VERY IMPRESSED WITH MINUTES THE WAKEFIELD FORWARDS THEY LAID 
THE PLATFORM FOR THAT KICKING GAME 
DANNY BROUGH JUST TAKES IT UP HE 
DOES NOT PANIC LOVELY OFFLOAD 
THIS IS JUST THE POWER ONCE AGAIN 
TWO DEFENDERS NOT STRONG ENOUGH 
ATKINS IS THERE 
AS A YOUNGSTER HE 
STARTED HIS PLAYING CAREER AT 
BRADFORD HE NEVER GOT A GAME THERE 
BUT HE HAS PROSPERED SINCE HIS MOVE 
TO WAKEFIELD OH DEAR HE HAS PULLED IT WIDE 
BUT WAKEFIELD ARE VERY MUCH IN THE 
ASCENDANCY 
VERY MUCH SO HE TAKES ASCENDANCY ADVANTAGE HE DOES NOT PANIC GOES 
DOWN THE SHORT SIDE IF THE MUGGERS 
WERE IN PLACE THEY WOULD HAVE 
PICKED DANNY BROUGH UP THE 
MARKERS HE WAS JUST TOO POWERFUL 
EASY YARDS FOR DANNY BROUGH I I THINK WE ARE SEEING IN THE LAST 
FEW MINUTES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
PLAYING IN SUPER LEAGUE AND 
NATIONAL LEAGUE WAKEFIELD HAVE HAD 
OVER A THIRD OF THE SEASON IN THAT 
PARTICULAR COMPETITION THAT WAS A 
VERY POOR MISTAKE BY SALFORD 
OFFSIDE ON THE RESTART 
THAT IS A 
SILLY MISTAKE A TAD PEDANTIC A LITTLE BIT I 
HAVE SEEN THAT A LOT AS LONG AS HE 
IS NOW CONSISTENT 
THAT IS THE 
QUESTION HUDDERSFIELD WERE 
PENALISED FOR A SIMILAR OFFENCE IN 
A RECENT GAME IN THE KICK OFF OF 
THE GAME IT IS ANOTHER SIX TACKLES OBST IS CAUSING THEM PROBLEMS GRIX A LITTLE BIT OF ACROBATICS AT THE END WAKEFIELD TRINITY WILDCATS 
ARE SUDDENLY IN THEIR POMP 
WHAT A 
GREAT BALL THE BALL GOES OUT A 
LOT OF PLAYERS AROUND THE MARKET 
THEY WERE ALL SUCKED INTO THE 
MARKER A LOVELY BALL 
THE QUESTION 
NOW IS HOW DO SALFORD RESPONDED 
THIS RESPOND TO THIS DANNY BROUGH WITH HIS TOUGHEST 
CONVERSION RIGHT FROM THE LEFT 
TOUCHLINE HE MISSED IT BY A DISTANCE JUST 
WATCH THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS 
HERE THEY ARE CAUGHT OUT WIDE 
THEY HAVE GOT THE MEN IT IS THE 
MONEY BALL HERE IT COMES THEY 
HAVE ALL GOT CAUGHT TOO MANY 
DEFENDERS NOT HAPPY MAN THAT THAT LOOKED LIKE A LOOK OF RESIGNATION 
FROM SHAUN MCRAE RESIGNED TO THE 
FACT THAT HIS SIDE HAD JUST 
CONCEDED THREE TRIES IN VERY QUICK 
SUCCESSION ROONEY WANTS TO GET ON WITH IT QUICKLY AGAIN HERE THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE DONE 
NOTHING FLASH THEY HAVE MADE THE 
HARD YARDS MADE THE CLUB RUN FOR 
THERE HALF BACKS TAKEN 
OPPORTUNITIES AND SCORED THEM THEY THEY ARE A GOOD SUPER LEAGUE SIDE THEIR 
POSITION DOES NOT TELL THE TRUTH OF 
THEIR ABILITY THEY CAME UP VERY 
CLOSE AT SAINT HELEN'S AND AT WIGAN 
IT IS A TERRIFIC KICK AND SAID ME 
BOUNCED BEYOND THE TWENTY AND IT WAS 
KICKED FROM WITH AND BEFORE TEA 
MOMENTUM CONTINUES WITHIN THAT 
THE FORTY IF EVER THERE WAS A MASTERCLASS OF 
HOW A TEAM WHO WERE FAVOURITES 
SHOULD COME AND PLAY AGAINST 
UNDERDOGS THIS IS IT WAKEFIELD 
ARE DOING EVER SO WELL 
YOU FEEL 
WITH ONLY THIRTY MINUTES GONE SALFORD 
HAVE TO SCORE LESS NEXT 
WAKEFIELD ARE FAVOURITES TO SCORE 
NEXT THOUGH WAKEFIELD SAID KNEE HAVE MOMENTUM NOW A POOR MISTAKE CERTAINLY IT HAS GIVEN THE KNOCK ON QUITE 
CLEARLY HE GOT IT RIGHT DIDN'T 
PLAY IT RIGHT FROM THEM BE IS LOOKING 
PRETTY GOOD OUT THERE THEY HAVE 
LIFTED THE TEMPO OF THE GAME OVER 
THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES AND IT IS 
BEARING THE RUSSIAN 
FROM THIS 
POSITION THEY SHOULD CLOSE UP THE 
GAME A WE ARE IN A POSITION TO DO 
THAT 
IT IS A VERY GOOD SIDE OUT THAT THERE BUT WE ARE CAPABLE OF 
SCORING A FEW MORE POINTS 
THAT IS 
A PENALTY STUART LITTLER WANTS TO 
GET ON WITH IT HIGH SHOT IS WHAT 
THE REFEREE HAS DECIDED THIS IS WHERE EXPERIENCE COUNTS 
ROBBIE PAUL'S TALKING ON THE FIELD 
IT IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT 
FOR HIS SIDE NOW PAUL HIGHTON HAS BEEN A REAL HELP FOR SALFORD OVER THE YEARS HE IS 
NOT BEING ALLOWED TO GET UP LAID 
ON OVER BY IT MCGILLIVRAY PENALTY 
VERY CLEVER BY PAUL HIGHTON L. THINK HE HAS HIS ARM CAUGHT UP VERY CLEVERLY MOVED THAT IS HE IS 
THIRTY ONE HE SHOULD HAVE LEARNED A THING 
OR TWO OVER THE YEARS SHOULD HE FIVE TACKLES FROM HERE CAN SALFORD 
JUST FIND A WAY OF TURNING THINGS 
AROUND ALMOST A BREAK FOR SIBBIT ALONG THE LINE AND DRIVEN IN BY 
JEWITT YOU CAN SEE THE WHITE LINE 
HERE IS A OCCUR AGAIN BIT PATRICK 
OUT THERE MYLER LITTLE SPAT AN AWARD WE'VE 
AND A DODGE LITTLE STEP AND A 
WEAVE AND A DODGE HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE POST HE DID 
HIT IT BUT JUST SHAVED IT AND MADE 
IT EASIER FOR WAKEFIELD AT AT WAKEFIELD HAVE LOOKED VERY 
COMFORTABLE GETTING THE BALL AWAY MAKING THE YARDS GREAT RECOVERY BY SIBBIT THE 
TACKLE FROM SO THAT IS SUDDENLY 
EVEN BETTER 
A GREAT TACKLE HAD TO 
BE MADE HE'S DISAPPOINTED AND 
REALLY HE GOT RUN DOWN BY SIBBIT 
AND HE LOSES THE BALL LOVELY BREAK 
AGAIN JUST WATCH HE BEATS SIBBIT BUT HE GETS BACK 
TO MAKE THAT TACKLE FORCES THE 
KNOCK ON 
THE HEART THE DESIRE 
THE DETERMINATION SHOWN BY SO THAT 
THEY ARE TO MAKE UP FOR HIS MISTAKE 
SHOWN BY SIBBIT A PENALTY FOR SALFORD THEY HAVE TO GET BETTER FIELD POSITION SALFORD A TERRIBLE KICK HE WON'T BE HAPPY WITH THAT WAKEFIELD FANS ARE CALLING FOR A 
HIGH TACKLE REFEREE INDICATED IT 
WAS ROUND THE CHEST WHITE FIELD IN 
CONTROL WOULD LOVE TO TURN THE 
SCREW A LITTLE TIGHTER WEEK 
FIELD WAKEFIELD GLEESON 
HAS BEEN IMPRESSIVE AS WELL JUST A FANTASTIC GAME ISN'T IT IT HAS BEEN AT ALL ACTION STUFF SO FAR 
WAKEFIELD IN CONTROL BUT SALFORD'S 
DESIRE THE UNDERDOGS REALLY ARE 
FIGHTING HARD HERE YOU CAN SEE 
WAKEFIELD ARE EDGING OF POSSESSION 
WISE IT'S GONNA BE A PENALTY HE SEES 
HIM COMING BUT THAT IS LATE SILLY CHALLENGE AS I WAS SAYING HE HAS BEEN 
INFLUENTIAL AND THAT IS SILLY JOHN 
KEAR WILL BE ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS 
RICHIE BIBEY BOSS BACK OFF HERE TEN 
MINUTES IN THE SIN BIN BIBEY'S 
HE IS OFF AND WILL MISS AT THE LAST 
FIVE MINUTES THIS IS AN IMPORTANT 
PART OF THE GAME HERE BECAUSE IF 
SALFORD CAN GET A TRY BACK 
SUDDENLY THEY WILL HAVE THE LEAD 
BACK TOO DID THAT WORK KEPT THEM GUESSING GOOD FOOT WORK STRAIGHT INTO ROONEY THEY REACHED FOR THE LINE AT BY 
ANDY BALLARD THE REFEREE IS 
CALLING FOR THE VIDEO REPLAY I SUSPECT HE IS LOOKING AT THE 
OBSTRUCTION IN THE BUILD UP TO THE 
PLAY 
FIRST PASS IS O. K. TRY I PLAY THINK FROM THAT ANYWAY MARTIN IS 
COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FORWARD PASS 
BUT 
WAS THERE AT AN OBSTRUCTION BUT THERE 
SIBBIT IS THE ONE HE WANTS THERE TO LOOK AT 
TONY MARTIN'S 
COMPLAINING LONG AND HARD NUMBER NUMBER THREE TONY MARTIN SIBBIT GETS IN 
THIS WAY AND 
HE COMPLAINED L. THINK HE HAS OVER RED THAT PLAY LOOK AT 
WHERE HIS EYES ARE HE IS 
COMPLAINING THERE LOOK AT IT AGAIN 
I THINK THE PASS HAS BEATEN HIM 
ANYWAY HE GOT CAUGHT BALL WATCHING 
MARTIN I WOULD GIVE THAT AS A TRY 
I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON 
THEIR JONATHAN WHETHER THE VIDEO 
REFEREE AGREES WITH YOU WE WILL 
HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WILL THE VIDEO REFEREE PUT SOME 
HAPPINESS BACK INTO THE HEARTS OF 
SALFORD NO TRY HE HAS GIVEN THE OBSTRUCTION 
WELL WELL THAT IS A OBSTRUCTION REAL TOUGH ONE L. WOULD BE 
INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT THE PLAYERS 
A VIEW ON IT WOULD BE HE IS JUST EXPLAINING THEIR I 
THINK HE EVER READ THAT THE PASS 
BEAT THEM ANYWAY LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT IT AGAIN 
THERE IS THE INCIDENT 
IT WAS NEVER 
GOING TO GET TO THE MAN 
I WOULD 
NOT HAVE ALSO L. THOUGHT HE EVER 
READ IT OVER READ IT 
IT REMAINS 
SALFORD TO WAKEFIELD SIXTEEN RICKY BIBEY WAS DELIGHTED WITH THAT IN THE STAND A WONDERFULLY CRAFTED TRY SHEER 
CLASS FROM A JAMIE ROONEY OR OBST 
HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW HIM FOR THE 
TOUCHDOWN 
THAT WAS ALL ABOUT TOUCHDOWN ACCELERATION AND APPRECIATING WHO'S 
IN FRONT OF YOU VERY VERY GOOD 
PLAY BY ROONEY FANTASTIC 
ACCELERATION USING THE INSIDE BALL 
GOOD SUPPORT BY SAM OBST HE IS LOW 
AND SLOW AND SLOW AND THEN HE 
ACCELERATES AWAY FROM SIBBIT 
THROUGH THE YAPP LOVELY TRY 
YAPP GOOD SUPPORT AND THAT IS A TWELVE 
POINT DECISION BY THE VIDEO REFEREE 
HAVE A GAME IT MIGHT JUST HAVE SWAN 
YOU WOULD HAVE MADE HER WAKEFIELD 
FAVOURITES ANYWAY EVEN IF SALFORD 
HAD SCORED THE TRY YOU WOULD STILL 
HAVE SAID THAT WAKEFIELD STILL HAVE 
THE ADVANTAGE WHAT THAT MIGHT HAVE 
DONE FOR SALFORD'S SELF BELIEF HAD 
THEY BEEN GIVEN THE TRY AND HAD 
THEY NOT CONCEDED JUST STOP IT THERE THIS IS THE GUY 
HE WILL GET TO HIM HE WAITS AND 
WEIGHTS AND THEN HE ACCELERATES 
THERE I'LL PAY IS TOO FAR BACK 
THE YAPP HAS GROWN OPENED UP HAD RENEGED GONE ON AND SCORED THE 
TROT TRY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY 
REMINISCENT OF TRY SCORED BY A 
LITTLE WELSHMAN A FEW YEARS BACK IN 
A TEST MATCH REMEMBER THAT FROM 
THE SUBLIME TO THE UNFORGIVABLE 
HAVE THEY GOT TIME TO GET ON THE 
BOARD THEY HAVE SIX TACKLES AND THE TWENTY THREE SECONDS LEFT FIFTY THREE SECONDS LEFT THAT WAS A SLIP MY FITZPATRICK IT LOOKED HIGH BUT IT WAS SLIP NOT THE BEST OF PASSES SIBBIT WHO 
TOOK IT BUT IT WAS OFFSIDE AGAINST 
WAKEFIELD THAT IS A TERRIFIC PLAY THAT WAS A 
WONDERFUL TRY THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD HAD 
REWORKED SOME MAGIC THERE AND MAYBE 
HE HAS GIVEN SALFORD SOME HOPE MALCOLM ALKER WITH THE SCORE RIGHT ON HALF TIME LOVELY PLAY HERE HE GOES STEP STEP PACE OFFLOAD LOVELY TRY NO PROBLEMS FOR ANDY BALLARD A 
CRUCIAL 
IS THAT DECISION NOW THAT THAT IS HALF TIME IT HAS BEEN A 
FANTASTIC CUP TIE IT IS ADVANTAGE 
WAKEFIELD BUT THE HEART AND SOUL 
PROVIDED BY SALFORD 
IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET GOING BUT 
AFTER THAT THE PENALTIES WAKEFIELD 
MADE THE MOST FIRST MAJOR 
BREAKTHROUGH THEY WAITED TWENTY 
MINUTES FOR ONE TRY AND THEN TWO 
MORE CAME SCOTT GRIX SOMERSAULTED 
OVER SALFORD WERE DISALLOWED THE 
THAT TRY AS WAKEFIELD SCORED AGAIN 
FINALLY IN BETWEEN THE POSTS 
MALCOLM ALKER GAVE SALFORD A 
LIFELINE LIFELINE THE ASSISTANT COACH AT WAKEFIELD IS 
WITH ME THAT LATE TRY MEANS IT IS 
WIDE OPEN AGAIN 
WE GAVE THEM A BIT 
OF FIELD POSITION AND TIMES 
GENERALLY THE GUYS HAVE HAD A GOOD 
FORTY MINUTES WE HAD JUST GOT TO KEEP 
WORKING THE SYSTEMS AND DOING THE 
PROCESS AS WE HAVE HAD SUCCESS 
WOULD FORCE UP AS JAMIE ROONEY MADE 
THE DIFFERENCE FOR YOU A NUMBER OF 
THE GUYS DANNY BROUGH HAS DONE A 
REALLY GOOD JOB 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE 
STATISTICS IN THE FIRST HALF IT 
WAS A WONDERFUL MATCH WAKEFIELD 
LEAD TWENTY TWO TO EIGHT 
BOTH PRETTY HIGH IN TERMS OF TACKLE 
COMPLETION IT IS FINELY BALANCED 
PERHAPS MORE SO THAN THE SCORELINE 
SUGGESTS 
WAKEFIELD HAVE GOT A GRIP SUGGESTS ON THE GAME HE SETS COMPLETED A 
PRETTY SIMILAR BUT WAKEFIELD'S 
KICKING GAME HAS BEEN FAR BETTER 
SALFORD HAVE HAD A FEW CHANCES AND 
NOT TAKEN THEM YOU WONDER HOW MANY 
CHANCES THEY WILL GET THEY GAVE 
THEMSELVES A LIFELINE 
WOULD YOU BE 
HAPPY IF YOU WERE THE WAKEFIELD 
COACH 
WE VOWED TO DOUBT THEY HAVE COACH DONE A VERY EFFICIENT JOB AND BEEN 
EFFECTIVE WITHOUT A DOUBT THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD SIDES IS 
THE SPEED OF THE WAKEFIELD SIDE 
SALFORD DID WELL TO CLAW THEIR WAY 
BACK HIM AT THE END BUT I THINK 
THEY NEED BETTER FIELD POSITION 
TALKING OF SPEED WE PICKED OUT 
DANNY BROUGH AT THE BEGINNING AND 
HE WAS CRUCIAL IN VIRTUALLY 
EVERYTHING GOING ON OUT THERE HE 
MADE A TRY SAVING TACKLE ON ANDY 
BALLARD A VERY EARLY ON WATCH HIM 
COME ACROSS 
WE SAW THIS IN THE 
HIGHLIGHTS BEFORE THE GAME HE DID 
THE SAME THING AGAINST HUDDERSFIELD 
LAST WEEK NOT ONLY HAS HE 
CONTROLLED THIS GAME BUT TO MAKE 
TACKLES LIKE THAT HIS SIDE REALLY 
NEEDED IT GAVE WAKEFIELD A BOOST 
EARLY ON 
IT WAS VERY TIGHT FOR THE 
FIRST TWENTY MINUTES IT WAS DEAD LEVEL 
AT TWO TO TWO THEN JAMIE ROONEY MADE THE 
BREAKTHROUGH FOR WAKEFIELD IT'S 
WAS VERY LEVEL 
IT WAS VERY LEVEL 
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE MARKERS 
AND THE DEFENDER ON THE LEFT HAND 
SIDE WAS GETTING TOO WIDE HERE IS 
THE SPEED WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
THEY COME FLOODING THROUGH IN 
NUMBERS WAKEFIELD ARE RENOWNED 
RENOWNED FOR THIS JAMIE ROONEY HAD 
GREAT AWARENESS TO FIND IT TRY LINE 
WOULD YOU CRITICISE THE DEFENDERS 
I THINK THEY WERE TIRED WAKEFIELD 
HAD QUITE A BIT OF BALL AND 
COMPLETED SUNSETS AND SALFORD MADE 
SOME ERRORS COMPLETED SOME 
UPSETS 
IT IS ALL ABOUT EXPLOITING UPSETS GAPS WE WILL SEE DANNY BROUGH DO 
THAT AGAIN JUST FINDING THE GAP IN 
THE SALFORD DEFENCE ATKINS TOOK 
TWO DEFENDERS OVER THE LINE WITH 
HIM 
IT WAS A REASONABLY QUICK PLAY HIM OFF THE BALL LOOK AT THE DEFENDERS 
AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN THAT 
BREAK HAS BEEN MADE ON THE OPPOSITE 
SIDE AND THEY HAVE GOT TO SCRAMBLE 
AND RACE BACK INTO THAT AREA LOOK 
AT HOW SLOW THEY ARE TO REACT THEY 
COULD HAVE SCORED ON EITHER SIDE OF 
THE RAP THERE WAKEFIELD FLOODED 
THROUGH IN NUMBERS GREATER 
AWARENESS FROM DANNY BROUGH HE 
COULD HAVE SCORED ON EITHER SIDE OF 
THAT IRAQ A LITTLE BIT OF A SIGN 
OF A SUPER LEAGUE SIDE FIRST IS A 
NATIONAL LEAGUE SIDE A SIDE 
STARTING TO TIRE ONCE YOU START 
LOSING THE PLAYER OF THE BALL AREA 
IT IS MORE DIFFICULT 
I AM VERY 
IMPRESSED WITH YOUR USE OF THE 
TORIES THE ONE THING YOU CAN'T 
AFFORD TO DO WHEN YOU ARE CHASING 
THE GAME IS MAKING BASIC AREA 
MAKE A BASIC ERROR 
IT IS CLEARLY 
OFFSIDE I DON'T THINK YOU SEE IT 
CALLED THAT OFTEN IT IS A TOUGH 
ONE FOR SALFORD BUT THEN SALFORD 
WHEN THREE SETS WITHOUT A BALL 
QUITE ACROBATIC FROM SCOTT GRIX 
YOU HAVE TO BE SLIGHTLY CAREFUL NOT 
TO DROP THE BALL OR DO ANYTHING 
STUPID WHEN YOU DO THAT BUT BUT SPECIALLY WHEN IT IS WET SALFORD SALFORD HAD NO LUCK ANDY BALLARD WAS HOLED 
UP EARLY ON AND HERE AGAIN HE 
THINKS HE HAS SCORED A TRY AND IT 
IS DISALLOWED 
WE SLIGHTLY DISAGREE 
ON THIS L. THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT 
CALL I THINK IT WAS OBSTRUCTION L. 
DON'T SEE ANY REASON IF HE IS 
GENUINELY GOING TO CATCH THAT PASS 
AS A PLAYER TO TRY AND SCORE A TRY 
FAIR ENOUGH BUT FOR ME HE HAS 
GONE THROUGH TO DELIBERATELY 
GETTING THE WAY OF SOME POTENTIAL 
DEFENDERS FOR WAKEFIELD 
WHY DO YOU 
DISAGREE 
IT IS AN INTERPRETATION DISAGREE I THINK HE WAS INVOLVED HE IS OUT 
OF THE PLAY BUT LOOKING AT THE GUY 
WITH THE BALL HE IS NOT PURPOSELY 
LOOKING TO RUN IN THE WAKE OF THE 
DEFENDER I THOUGHT IT WAS A TRY L. 
WOULD GIVE IT TO SALFORD TO EVEN 
THE GAME UP 
IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
THAT MUCH THAT BIT MORE EXCITING 
LOOK AT JAMIE ROONEY'S VISION AND 
SPEED 
IT IS THE SPEED WE WERE SPEED TALKING ABOUT MALCOLM ALKER IS 
CAUGHT IN NO MAN'S LAND JAMIE 
ROONEY PICKS THE BIGGER SLOWER MAN 
OUT SOMETIMES YOU TRY TO GET YOUR 
SMALLER MEN ON THE BIGGER MEN YOU 
ARE LOOKING FOR MISMATCHES IN THAT 
AREA WAKEFIELD FOUND A FEW IN THE 
FIRST HALF SALFORD FINALLY MANAGED 
TO SCORE 
JUST AT THE DEATH OF THE 
FIRST HALF MALCOLM ALKER JOINED 
THEM IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN HE HAS BEEN A REAL 
SPORT 
THEY NEEDED THIS ALKER DID SPORT HIS JOB AS A TRUE HOOKER DOES 
BACKING UP THEY NEEDED IT TO KEEP 
THE HOME FANS INTERESTED 
MOST OF 
THE MOMENTUM IN THE FIRST HALF WAS 
WITH WAKEFIELD IF YESTERDAY'S LIVE 
MATCH WAS ANYTHING TO GO BY IT 
COULD ALL CHANGE IN THE SECOND HALF 
THIS WAS HARLEQUINS AGAINST 
CASTLEFORD YES SHENTON IN FOR A TRY HE IS OVER GREAT PASS AND SUPERBLY 
TAKEN BY ADAM FLETCHER NO 
HESITATION WITH THAT ONE IN THE 
CORNER SUPERB TRY BEAUTIFUL PLAY MICHAEL 
WORRINCY TICKET TOOK IT CHAD RANDALL IS OVER BENEATH THE 
POSTS AND SUDDENLY HARLEQUINS ARE 
FINDING FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS HE CALLED IT TONY CLUBB BEAUTIFUL RUN FROM THE FORMER 
CASTLEFORD MAN MAGNIFICENT TRY 
FROM DANNY ORR IT IS A TRY A HE IS OVER GARETH HAGGERTY HAS DESERVED THAT STRIFE TRY JON WELLS LOOKING FOR A TRY 
AGAINST HIS OLD CLUB RANDALL THE 
ROUT IS COMPLETE IN THE SECOND HALF 
RAY FRENCH DESCRIBING THE NINE 
TRIES SCORED YESTERDAY 
SALFORD ARE IN NATIONAL LEAGUE ONE 
BUT THEY HAVE ASPIRATIONS OF MAKING 
IT BACK INTO SUPER LEAGUE 
A NEW SALFORD GROUND IS TAKING 
SHAPE JUST DOWN THE ROAD THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE IS WITH ME HOW MUCH OF A 
WRENCH WHEN IT BE TO LEAVE THIS 
PLACE 
MIXED FEELINGS REALLY IT PLACE HAS BEEN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN YEARS HERE PERSONALLY 
I HAVE DONE TWENTY SIX IT WILL BE A WRENCH 
FOR EVERYBODY TO MOVE NO MATTER 
HOW CLOSE IT IS IT IS OUR HOME IN IN FAIRNESS THE OLD PLACE IS STARTING 
TO LOOK TIRED 
IT HAS SERVED US 
VERY WELL OVER THE YEARS BUT IT IS 
TIME TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE WE HAVE 
TO LOOK FORWARD AND MADE IT IS 
TIME FOR A NEW FEATURE THE ICONIC 
STADIUM WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER 
JUSTIFIES THAT MOVE 
WHERE DOES IT 
FIT INTO YOUR OF RAW STRATEGY TO BE 
A SUPER LEAGUE CLUB AGAIN 
OVERALL STRATEGY 
WE NEED 
FACILITIES THAT MATCH SUPER LEAGUE 
FACILITIES THE GAME IS GOING 
FORWARD IN LEAPS AND BOUNDS AND WE 
WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT 
WE CAN 
SEE SOME OF THE PLANS IT LOOKS A 
FANTASTIC PROJECT 
HE IS A 
MARVELLOUS PROJECT IT IS GOOD NOT 
JUST FOR THE CLUB BUT FOR THE CITY 
AND SUPER LEAGUE ITSELF IT IS A 
RUGBY LEAGUE STADIUM NOT A STADIUM 
THAT RUGBY LEAGUE IS PLAYED IN 
THERE IS AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE 
THERE THERE ARE NOT MANY STADIUMS 
OF THAT LEVEL BEING PUT TOGETHER 
FOR RUGBY LEAGUE CLUBS IT IS A 
GREAT STEP FORWARD FOR THE GAME 
TELL US ABOUT SOME OF THE 
FACILITIES WE WILL SEE 
APART FROM 
THE STADIUM ITSELF THERE IS A 
FOUR STAR HOTEL AND AN EXHIBITION 
CENTRE THAT RIVALS ANYTHING IN THE 
NORTH WEST 
CAN YOU FILL IT 
THE WE NORTH WEST WILL FILL IT PEOPLE IN THIS AREA 
HAVE PROVED FOR MANY YEARS THAT 
THEY WILL FOLLOW QUALITY SPORT IN 
QUALITY FACILITIES WE HAVE SEEN 
THAT AT MANCHESTER UNITED WE 
PLAYED THE GRAND FINAL NOT MORE 
THAN A MILE AWAY AND WE FEEL THAT 
THIS AREA NEEDS GOOD SUPER LEAGUE 
TEAM AND GOOD SUPER LEAGUE STADIUM 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US STADIUM THE EMPHASIS TODAY IS ON STAYING 
ALIVE IN THE CARNEGIE CHALLENGE CUP 
THE SALFORD PLAYERS THERE JOHN 
KEAR HAS JUST BEEN ENCOURAGING THE 
CROWD AS HE HAS BEEN GOING PAST HE 
DOES NOT WANT A SHOCK HE IS THE 
WAKEFIELD COACH L. CAN'T THINK WHY 
HE IS TRYING TO GET SUPPORT FROM 
THE FANS AS MOST OF THEM WILL BE 
SALFORD FANS 
THEY NEED TO SCORE 
FIRST PROBABLY SCORE FIRST AND NOT 
CONCEDE IF THEY CONCEDE ANY MORE 
POINTS IT COULD BE TOO MUCH OF A 
MOUNTAIN FOR THEM TO CLIMB REALLY 
TRY TO KEEP IT TIGHT GET SOME 
FIELD POSITION APPLY A LITTLE BIT 
OF PRESSURE ON THE WAKEFIELD SIDE 
THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT THERE AND 
WIN IT IN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES 
YOU HAVE ALWAYS SAID WAKEFIELD WILL 
WIN THIS EASILY KEVIN 
I THINK 
THEY HAVE GOT TOO MUCH L. THINK 
WAKEFIELD'S KICKING GAME IS TOO 
GOOD THEY WILL KICK INTO THE 
CORNERS ALL DAY LONG THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ADRENALIN 
FILLED CUP TIES HERE OVER THE YEARS 
BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX A SALFORD TEAM ENDED 
THE WIGAN'S FAME HAS RUN IN THE 
CHALLENGE CUP THEY HAD GONE FORTY THREE 
UNBEATEN CUP TIES EIGHT CHALLENGE 
CUP WINS THEN THEY CAME HERE AND 
SALFORD BEAT THEM IT WILL TAKE 
SOMETHING AS ADRENALIN FILLED IN 
THE SECOND HALF IF THEY ARE TO 
CLAIM ANOTHER SUPER LEAGUE SCALP 
THIS AFTERNOON THIS AFTERNOON 
SALFORD TRAILED BY DISTANCE TWENTY TWO TO EIGHT BUT THE TRY JUST BEFORE THE BREAK JUST HAVE GIVEN THEM SOME 
MIGHT JUST HAVE GIVEN THEM SOME HOPE SALFORD WITH THE DEFENCE I HAVE TO 
SAY THERE WAS KNOCK ON 
HE SAYS 
IT'S OFF HIS FOOT NO IT WAS A KNOCK ON THE IT WAS HIS FOOT AND HIS HANDS I THINK FIELD POSITION IS THE KEY 
GOOD KICKING GAME GOOD FIELD 
POSITION 
SCORING JUST BEFORE THE POSITION BREAK TRADITIONALLY IS THE IDEAL 
TIME TO DO IT AND SCORING JUST 
AFTER THE BREAK WOULD SUIT SO OFTEN 
FIND SALFORD FINE AS WELL IN MY LITTLER STILL THREE TACKLES TO COME HERE HE DID WELL THERE WELL ENOUGH TO KEEP THE BALL IN GOOD AT BOUNCING DEFENSIVE LINE 
FROM WAKEFIELD 
THE OUTSIDE RUNNERS 
I. JUST OVER RUNNING IT THEY ARE 
FAR TOO FLAT A QUICK RESTART 
COMES ATKINS A MINUTE AND A HALF LEFT FOR BIBEY IN THE SIN BIN WAKEFIELD ARE STILL DOWN TO TWELVE 
THERE HE IS POISED AND READY TO 
RETURN MISSED OPPORTUNITY 
FOR WAKEFIELD NOW SO MUCH PACE LEO LATU SALFORD HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HERE CANNOT CONCEDE AWAY HE GOES THE REFEREE IS ASKING FOR THE VIDEO REPLAY OBSTRUCTION

HOLDING OF THE SHED IN THE BUILD UP 
SHARED

BACK COMES LEO LATU LITTLER MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN DEFENDING IF IT IS CONSISTENT IT WILL BE A NO TRY

THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT 
HIS CONSISTENCY 
I HAVE TO SAY 
ALTHOUGH WE VEHEMENTLY DISAGREE 
WITH THE DECISION HAVING LISTENED 
TO STEVE MCNAMARA'S EXPLANATION I 
CAN SEE WHERE HE IS COMING FROM THE VIDEO REFEREE HAS GOT THEM BOTH RIGHT TODAY COULD HARD YARDS BEING AND HERE AND HERE BROCKLEHURST GATHERING DEFENDERS AROUND HIM AS HE RANGES FORWARD LITTLER'S CAUGHT IN POSSESSION JUST A BIT TOO STRONG NOT HAPPY 
WITH HIMSELF MYLER 
HIS KICKING 
GAME HAS NOT BEEN GREAT TODAY HE

HAS LOOKED IMPRESSIVE AT TIMES 
HASN'T HE A BIG FUTURE PREDICTED 
FOR HIM UP IN BY MACGILLIVRAY HE WILL BE ON 
WORLD CUP DUTY THIS AUTUMN WITH THE 
SCOTS HERE COMES BROUGH UNDERNEATH AND 
BESIDE THE STICKS AT THE BREAK 
AGAIN FINDING SALFORD WANTING 
RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE WAKEFIELD 
ARE CRUISING IT NOW 
YEAH JUST 
WATCH THE SUPPORT THEY STREAM 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE AGAIN IT IS 
BETWEEN THE TWO BIG MEN A BIG GAP 
THERE TOO MUCH THERE WERE TOO MANY IN SUPPORT DANNY BROUGH HAVING SCORED THE TRY NOW HAS THE CHANCE TO ADD THE TWO IN CASE YOU THINK HE HAS BEEN IN AN 
ACCIDENT WITH SEAGULL THAT IS AN INTENDED HAIRSTYLE TWENTY EIGHT N. T. S. TO EIGHT WAKEFIELD LEAD NOW 
LOOK AT THE GAP IT IS TOO BIG NOW STRAIGHT THROUGH IT IS THE PACE 
HE HIT THE ACCELERATOR AND WATCHES 
THEM ALL STREAM THROUGH ANY ONE OF 
THREE PLAYERS COULD SCORE THERE YOU WOULD EXPECT WHITE FIELD TO GO 
ON FROM HERE TO WIN IT WEEK 
FIELD WAKEFIELD THEY WILL WANT TO KEEP THAT LEVEL 
OF RESISTANCE GOING HERE SALFORD 
IF THEY CAN SHAUN MCRAE WILL BE 
LEARNING THING OR TWO ABOUT HIS 
PLAYERS IN THE NEXT MINUTES OR SO LEO LATU QUICK FEET JUST A QUICK ATTEMPT WASN'T IT 
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE WEEK IN 
WEEK OUT 
THIS WILL BE THE LAST 
TACKLE WHEN THEY EVENTUALLY GET 
ROUND TO PLAYING THE BALL GRIX TRIES TO KICK IT ON 
DESPERATELY BECAUSE HE KNOWS IF HE 
HAD BEEN CAUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE TO 
HAND IT OVER ANYWAY UP IN THE AIR WHAT DID THEY TEACH 
YOU AT SCHOOL DO NOT LET IT PASS 
HAVE TO GET THERE TO CATCH IT THERE 
DON'T YOU ALKER IS TAKEN IN BY BROCKLEHURST 
WAKEFIELD WILL BE INVOLVED IN THAT 
ONE OF SEVERAL TASTY GAMES TAKING 
PLACE IN YOUR BACK YARD IN A COUPLE 
OF WEEKS THIRD AND FOURTH MAY ALL 
SIX SUPERLEAGUE GAMES WILL BE 
PLAYED AT THE MILLENNIUM STADIUM THREE GAMES ON THE SATURDAY THREE 
AGAIN GAMES ON SUNDAYS THERE 
WILL HAVE A BEARING ON THE SUPER 
LEAGUE TABLE TOO MAKING THE YARDAGE LOOK VERY EASY 
DON'T THEY 
A HUGE KICK CAUGHT 
EASILY ENOUGH BY BULLARD AND 
OFFSIDE BALLADE A LOVELY KICK THIS THE FAIRLY OBVIOUS THERE THAT HE WAS OFFSIDE THERE'S SIBBIT WAKEFIELD HAVE MADE 
NINE HUNDRED SIXTY YARDS FOR THE SIX HUNDRED OF A SALFORD 
THAT TELLS US A LOT ADAMSON SLOWLY PICKS HIMSELF TO HIS FEET ALKER WAS THERE TO PICK UP THE 
PIECES THE REFEREE IS NOT 
IMPRESSED WITH THAT CLAIM FROM 
SALFORD HIGHER AND A LITTLE TOO LONG BEGAN 
IT BOUNCES TOO WIDE 
ANOTHER BIG 
DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF THE 
KICKING HERE WAKEFIELD WITH BROUGH 
AND WITH RELIEF ROONEY 
AT SEVENTEEN 
ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON I WOULD HAVE 
BEEN AT HOME DOING MY HOMEWORK AND 
HE IS PLAYING ON THE BIGGEST RUGBY 
LEAGUE STAGE 
WHAT D'YOU WANT ME TO 
SAY NOTHING OBST WAITING AT DUMMY HALF AGAIN 
NOW WILKES HOW WAS IT IN HE HAS 
BEEN AROUND A BIT THIS IS HIS EIGHTH 
CLUB FITZPATRICK HAD IT COMING I THINK 
HIS HEAD WAS ON THE LINE 
EVENTUALLY 
PENALTY FOR SALFORD EVENTUALLY LOVELY KICK LOOK AT THAT IF THAT 
BOUNCES UP THAT IS TRY VERY WELL 
PLAYED IT IS HIS HEAD ON THE TOUCH 
LINE 
ANOTHER PENALTY GIVEN THERE LINE BECAUSE THE TACKLE WAS COMPLETE CRAIG STAPLETON PENALTY AGAIN FOR SALFORD ONLY SIX CONCEDED BY SALFORD SO FAR 
ELEVEN BY WAKEFIELD IT HAS NOT PROVED 
TOO COSTLY FROM THEIR POINT OF 
VIEW OUTCOME AGAIN AT TRYING TO DRIVE 
HIS SIDE ON FROM DUMMY HALF 
ALKER OH DEAR DROPPED DOWN BEHIND ADAMSON HERE COMES OBST STEFAN RATCHFORD ANOTHER PLAYER TO 
KEEP AN EYE ON 
HE DID NOT HAVE THE 
LEGS TO GET THERE JUST DROP ON IT JOHN KEAR HAS A CERTAIN AFFINITY 
WITH THIS COMPETITION SHEFFIELD IN 
NINETY EIGHT EVENTUALLY BEAT SALFORD IN THE 
SEMI FINALS THAT YEAR IT IS SAID 
ME ANOTHER TRY SEAN GLEESON'S OVER 
VERY GOOD CENTRE PLAY BY MARTYN HE 
DRIFTS WIDE TRIES TO GET ON THE 
OUTSIDE OF HIS MAN AND GETS THE 
PASS AWAY THERE IS THE TURNOVER HE KNOWS HE 
HAS NOT GOT THE LEGS SO HE JUST 
FALLS ON IT GREAT CENTRE PLAY 
JUST DRIFT SOUTH SIDE BALLARD 
COMES IN TRY GOOD CENTRE PLAY A FAMOUS NAME 
SEAN GLEESON HE IS THE COUSIN OF 
MARTIN GLEESON THE GREAT BRITAIN 
INTERNATIONAL AND MARK GLEESON 
WHO WAS ALSO WITH WARRINGTON AND 
THIRTY TWO TO EIGHT WAKEFIELD REMAIN VERY MUCH IN 
CONTROL 
IF WE STOP IT THERE HE CONTROL JUST DRIFTS ON THE OUTSIDE AS HE 
DOES THAT HE COMMITS THIS GUY 
THEN GETS THE BALL AWAY VERY 
CLEVER PLAY GOOD CENTRE PLAY IT HAS BEEN DECISIVE TODAY REAL 
CLINICAL EFFICIENT PLAY SOME 
FLASHES OF BRILLIANCE FROM 
WAKEFIELD AS WELL ALONG THE WAY 
SALFORD HAVE GIVEN IT LOADS BUT IT 
IS THE GULF THAT HAS PROVED 
UNBRIDGEABLE TODAY BETWEEN SUPER 
LEAGUE AND NATIONAL LEAGUE HE WOULD NOT WANT TO GET BETWEEN 
BIBEY AND LEULUAI 
THERE IS A 
LITTLE BIT OF FRUSTRATION IN THIS 
TACKLE I AM NOT SURE IF IT WAS 
LEULUAI I AM NOT SURE WHO IT WAS THEY HAVE JUST GOT TO HANG ON IN 
THERE NOW THERE IS A LONG TIME 
LEFT THREE OF THEM NEEDED TO HOLD RHYNIE BACK ROONEY BACK JASON GOLDEN DROPPED IT HAD THE 
NUMBERS THERE AGAIN DANNY BROUGH 
CREATED THE OVERLAP BY JUST GOING 
AROUND ONE DEFENDER FIFTH TACKLE METRES GAINED THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE 
THAT IS WHY THE HALF UNBELIEVABLE BACKS HAVE HAD A ARMCHAIR RIDE THE 
WAKEFIELD FORWARDS HAD DONE 
UNBELIEVABLY WELL GRIX IS ANOTHER OF SIBLINGS IN THE 
GAME HIS BROTHER SIMON PLAYS AT 
WARRINGTON HIGH TACKLE FROM ROUGH BUT HE GOT 
AWAY WITH IT FROM DANNY BROUGH 
AGAIN IT SALFORD GET AWAY WITH IT 
THEY GET ANOTHER SIX TACKLES ADAMSON DOING WELL TO TIDY THINGS 
UP JAY PITTS HAD STAYED DOWN I I THINK SHE HAD A BANK TO THE HEAD 
HE HAD A BANG BALLARD WAS VERY VERY CLOSE BUT 
IN THE END NOBODY GOT TOUCH OF 
STOPPED A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH ON 
THE KICK 
LOVELY KICK JUST A 
LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON IT 
NEVER GONNA GET THERE 
THE IN GOAL 
AREA HAS LOOKED QUITE TIGHT LET'S HEAR FROM THE BRADFORD BULLS 
COACH WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE SECOND 
HALF 
SALFORD LOOK REASONABLY HALF DANGEROUS IT IS ONLY BECAUSE 
WAKEFIELD TURNED THE BALL OVER IN 
THAT AREA OF THE PARK AND THEY HAVE 
NOT DONE THAT WAKEFIELD HAVE BEEN 
SO GOOD MOST OF THE TIME THEY HAD 
BEEN AT THE RIGHT END OF THE PARK 
SALFORD DON'T QUITE HAVE THE SPEED 
TO GO THE FULL DISTANCE IT IS TOO 
TOUGH FOR THEM TODAY 
BALLARD DID 
NOT HAVE A CHANCE THERE HE WAS 
CAUGHT BY THE DEFENDERS AND JACKED 
OUT OF PLACE IT MEANS INSTEAD OF 
SALFORD HAVING POSITION IT IS HEAD 
AND FEED TO WAKEFIELD GREAT GREAT KICKING GAME GOOD CHASE JUST THE 
STRENGTH BALLARD TRIES TO GET IN 
THERE ARE TWO PLAYERS WHO KEEP HIM 
ON HIS FEET AND DRAG HIM INTO TOUCH IF GRIX HAD STAYED A BIT DEEPER 
THERE THE OVERLAP WOULD HAVE BEEN 
CREATED WE HAVE SEEN SOME SPARKLING TRIES 
IN THIS CUP TIE FANCY THEM MIGHT 
BE SOME MORE WAKEFIELD AND IN THE 
MOOD WAKEFIELD ART IN THE MOOD WILKES COULD NOT QUITE IT DID 
COME AT HIM LIKE A BULLET TO BE 
FAIR 
HE HAS DROPPED A COUPLE NOW FAIR HE WILL NOT BE HAPPY L. DON'T THINK 
SHE WAS EXPECTING IT HE WAS 
EXPECTING IT 
A LOT OF ERRORS MADE 
BY WAKEFIELD THESE STATISTICS 
PERHAPS SUGGEST THE OTHER SIDE 
SHOULD BE ON THE LEAD IN THE LEAD 
MORE PENALTIES CONCEDED BY 
WAKEFIELD YET THEY LEAD 
COMFORTABLY THE ONLY STAT THAT REALLY COUNTS IS 
THE ONE ON THE SCOREBOARD MORE MORE TRIES SCORED BY WAKEFIELD THAT IS 
THE KILLER STAT A REMINDER THAT EVERY SUPER LEAGUE 
CUP CLUB APART FROM CASTLEFORD 
WHO WERE BEATEN YESTERDAY BY QUINS 
WILL BE IN THE DRAW FOR THE FIFTH 
ROUND OF THE CHALLENGE CUP YOU CAN 
SEE THAT ON TUESDAY AT SIX FORTY FIVE P. M. IT 
STARTS TO GET MORE AND MORE 
INTERESTING THIS COMPETITION IT 
IS THE OLDEST AND SOME WOULD SAY 
THE MOST GLAMOUROUS RUGBY CUP 
COMPETITION IN THE WORLD AND THE KICK IS JUST OVER A HIT GIVEN AWAY A THING HE FORGOT 
RICHARD MOORE WAS ON HIS OUTSIDE 
SHAUN MCRAE WON THIS COMPETITION IN 
NINETY SIX AND NINETY SEVEN HE IS NOT GOING TO WIN 
IT THIS YEAR BUT HE WILL BE 
LEARNING AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT HIS 
SIDE AS THEY CONTINUED TO TRY TO 
KEEP THAT TOP SPOT IN NATIONAL 
LEAGUE ONE NO PROMOTION THIS YEAR 
BY RIGHTS AT THE END OF THE YEAR 
OR RATHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR 
THE R. F. L. WILL DECIDE WHO WILL HAVE 
LICENCES TO PLAY IN SUPER LEAGUE 
NEXT YEAR SALFORD WILL HOPE THEY 
ARE AMONGST THE LUCKY ONES THEY HAVE A PENALTY ANXIOUS LOOKS FROM THE COACH AS 
SALFORD LOOKED TO PRESS LOOK TO 
PRESS THAT 
HAS GONE FREE OLIVER WILKES HAS BEEN PENALISED FOR IMPEDING IT 
WILL BE ANOTHER SET OF SIX FOR 
SALFORD TO HAMMER THIS LINE WAKEFIELD'S DEFENCE IS NOW BEING 
STRETCHED THEY HAVE BEEN ON THEIR 
OWN LINE FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF 
TACKLES CAN SALFORD FIND A WAY 
THROUGH IT WILL BE ANOTHER PENALTY THAT 
WAS AN INTERESTING CALLED WHEN WHEN THROUGH THE HORIZONTAL THERE THE 
REFEREE SAYS THE TACKLE WAS 
DANGEROUS 
YES THE DECISION AGAIN DANGEROUS GOOD DECISION IT WILL BE ANOTHER SET OF SIX THE 
REFEREE SAID IT GOT TOUCH OFF THE 
WAKEFIELD PLAYER 
THAT IS THE FOURTH 
SET NOT A GOOD PASS GREAT DEFENCE STILL AWAKE FIELD WORKING SO HARD 
THEY HAVE A HUGE LEAD AND YET THEY 
ARE WORKING TIRELESSLY HERE IN A 
SPELL OF DEFENDING WAKEFIELD IT GOES DEAD AND 
A SALFORD DESPITE A CLUSTER OF TACKLES 
DOZENS AND DOZENS OF OPPORTUNITIES CANNOT 
FIND A WAY THROUGH THE WAKEFIELD 
LINE 
A CHANCE OF WAKEFIELD GOING LINE UP FIELD AND SCORING YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THE WAKEFIELD 
LINE HERE THE BODY LANGUAGE OF 
SOME OF THE PLAYERS THEY ARE 
FEELING GOOD THEY ARE HAPPY A LOT OF THE 
PLAYERS TO TAKE PREVIOUS HERE 
BRIVE US ROONEY ONE SIDE BROUGH THE OTHER SIDE THAT IS A GOOD KICK ONLY ONE KNOCK ON SIX MORE TACKLES HERE ODDS ON FOR A TRY HERE THEY HAVE GIVEN EVERYTHING HAVEN'T THEY HE IS OVER THE LINE THE QUESTION 
IS DID HE PUT IT DOWN DID HE 
BRING IT DOWN FAIRLY AND SQUARELY 
HE IS HANDING IT OVER TO THE VIDEO 
REFEREE THAT LOOKS LIKE A TRY FROM THERE 
DOUBLE MOVEMENT IS ONE OF THE 
QUESTIONS 
SO STILL MOVING ISN'T QUESTIONS HE IT IS A DOUBLE MOVEMENT DID HE JAGGED OVER THAT IS A TOUGH ONE

WAKEFIELD DEFENCE FOUR OF THEM 
QUICKLY KNITTING THEMSELVES AROUND 
HIM NO CHANCES TAKEN BY TONY MARTIN A LOVELY LONG BALL A LITTLE CHIP THEY HAVE BURIED BEEN VERY COMFORTABLE DEFENSIVELY TODAY SOMETHING OPPRESSIVE ABOUT 
HARLEQUINS THIS YEAR THE NUMBER OF 
LONDON PLAYERS THEY ARE BRINGING 
THREE THEY HAVE THIS TACK OF BEING 
AN AUSSIE OUTFIT FOR SO LONG THAT 
IS A PASS THAT FITZPATRICK CAN 
QUICKLY FORGET BUT THE LICENSING 
SYSTEM IS ALL ABOUT WELL PARTLY 
ABOUT PUSHING BACK THE BOUNDARIES 
OF RUGBY LEAGUE IF YOU PUSH BACK 
THE BOUNDARIES YOU HAVE TO BRING 
PLAYERS THROUGH AND THAT IS WHAT 
HARLEQUINS HAVE BEEN DOING FITZPATRICK HIDING HIS HEAD GOLDEN TRIES IT ON THERE IS A 
MINUTE LEFT TO PLAY HERE WAKEFIELD 
HAVE PERFORMED WONDERFULLY WELL 
THEY WILL BE LOOKING TO CAPTAINS OF 
IF THEY CAN CAP THINGS OFF IF 
THEY CAN OFFSIDE AGAINST WAKEFIELD IT WAS A 
RATTLER WASN'T IT 
I'M NOT IT 
AT KING'S HEAD HIM THERE IF AT 
KING'S HURT HIM THERE ATKINS THAT IS A STINGER ISN'T IT JUST 
GOT A STING ON THE TOP OF THE 
SHOULDER 
A COUPLE OF BITS TO THE SHOULDER HEAD AND IN THE 
I DON'T THINK HE 
FELT THOSE HE WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN 
FROM THE STING OR IT IS LIKE GOING INTO THE RING WITH 
JOE CARR SAID YOU WITH YOUR ARMS 
TIED BEHIND YOUR BACK THIS IS A WORRY FOR WAKEFIELD AT 
THE END OF THE GAME AT BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE HAD SO MANY INJURIES THEY 
WILL NOT WANT ANOTHER HERE 
I TELL 
YOU WHAT HAPPENED I HOPE HE'S O. K. 
HE IS MOVING EVERYTHING HE IS 
JUST THAT IS GOOD TO SEE JUST WATCH HE 
GETS HIS HEAD IN THE WRONG POSITION 
AND THE HIP BONE JUST CATCHES HIM 
ON THE TEMPLE HE FALLS BACK AND I 
AM GLAD TO SEE HE IS UP AND ABOUT 
AND OKAY AND READY TO GO ON THIRTY THIRTY SECONDS LEFT TO PLAY IF I HAVE 
JUST HAD ALL THAT BEATING TO THE 
HEAD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO 
GO OFF SALFORD TRYING TO FINISH 
WITH A FLOURISH HERE SECONDS REMAINING A FLASH OF BRILLIANCE BUT NOT 
QUITE BACK FOR RATCHFORD THEY 
MIGHT AS WELL THROW IT AROUND HERE THE HOOTER WILL SOUND IT HAS BEEN 
A TERRIFICALLY PROFESSIONAL JOB 
DONE BY WAKEFIELD HERE TODAY THEY 
HAVE LOOKED EVERY INCH THE SUPER 
LEAGUE SIDE FROM BEGINNING TO END 
TRIALLED BRIEFLY WHEN THEY CONCEDED 
THE PENALTY AMOUNTED TO ZERO BEHIND 
PROF'S PENALTY DREW THINGS LEVEL 
AGAIN AND HE TOOK CHARGE FROM THERE 
PROF SALFORD HAVE GIVEN IT 
EVERYTHING 
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE EVERYTHING BETWEEN ARE THE TWO LEAGUES VERY 
POWERFUL LAID THE PLATFORM AND 
THEN THE HALF PASSES HAVE RUN THAT 
THE SHOW 
SHAUN MCRAE WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED ROBBIE PAUL WILL BE 
BACK ON A SOFA FOR THE NEXT ROUND 
OF THE CHALLENGE CUP WAKEFIELD 
TRINITY WILDCATS ARE IN THE HAT FOR 
THE NEXT ROUND AND JOHN KEAR'S 
CHALLENGE CUP MAGIC CARRIES ON 
THOSE STATISTICS OF SUPER LEAGUE 
SIDES BEEN SO DOMINANT OVER LOWLY 
SIDES CONTINUED TO BE PROVEN TRUE 
WAKEFIELD JUST TOO STRONG SALFORD 
FOR ALL THEIR EFFORT JUST COULD NOT 
GET THROUGH THEY COULD NOT SCORE 
AT ALL IN THE SECOND HALF JOHN 
KEAR THROUGH TO THE SECOND ROUND 
OF THE CHALLENGE CUP FIFTH ROUND 
THIS WAS A POTENTIAL BANANA SKIN 
WAS THAT THE KIND OF PROFESSIONAL 
PERFORMERS IT DEMANDED 
BE WAS VERY 
PROFESSIONAL WE WERE AWARE THAT 
ITS SALFORD SAW THIS AS A WAY OF 
STAMPING THEIR CREDENTIALS FOR A 
LICENCE THESE YOUNG LADS COMING IN 
HAVE DONE THEMSELVES CREDIT THEY 
HAVE BEEN LED BY SOME GOOD 
EXPERIENCED PLAYERS 
WE PINPOINTED 
DANNY BROUGH AS A DANGER MAN FOR 
YOU MAN OF THE MATCH PERFORMANCE 
TREMENDOUS THEY ALL HUNG IN THERE 
THEY PLAYED SOME VERY GOOD RUGBY 
LEAGUE I WAS REALLY PLEASED WITH 
THE DEFENCE IT INDICATES AS WELL 
THAT WE WANT SUPER LEAGUE LICENCE 
THE FACTORS WE HAVE CONCEDED THREE 
TRIES IN THE LAST THREE GAMES WE 
WANTED TO MAKE IT FOR FOUR IN FOUR 
YOU WOULD NOT ANOTHER RUN IN THE 
CHALLENGE CUP THE IS CERTAINLY 
WOULD DANNY BROUGH IS WITH US AS 
WELL WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES 
WE TRIED TO 
COMPLETE A DAY WE KNEW IT WOULD BE 
A TOUGH BATTLE COMING TO SALFORD 
THEY ARE PUSHING FOR PROMOTION FOR 
NEXT SEASON TO GET A FRANCHISE WE 
CAME HERE TO COMPETE 
IT WAS A 
BRUISING BATTLE 
BE IT WAS A TOUGH 
ENCOUNTER WE KNEW WE COULD COME 
AWAY WITH IT THE WERE VERY FEW 
NERVES IN THE DRESSING ROOM COMING 
HERE THEY ARE ALWAYS THE NERVES 
EVERY GAME A CHALLENGE CUP GAME IS 
A ONE OFF WE WERE NERVOUS COMING 
HERE BECAUSE THEY WERE PUSHING FOR 
IT 
YOU HAVE BEEN TO A CHALLENGE IT CUP FINAL AND WON THAT MUST 
INCREASE YOUR APPETITE FOR MORE IT IT DOES EVERYONE WANTS TO WIN 
TROPHIES IT WAS JUST ABOUT GETTING 
THROUGH TODAY 
CAN THAT RELATIONS 
MAN OF THE MATCH WELL DONE DOES 
THE SCORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE 
GAME 
PROBABLY IT WAS A TOUGH GAME GAME WE KNEW IT WOULD BE TOUGH COMING TO 
SALFORD WE KNEW WE HAD TO PUT IN A 
GOOD PERFORMANCE TO BEAT THEM AND 
WE DID WE WILL PROBABLY A BETTER 
TEAM IN THE END THEY WILL BE A 
TOUGH TEAM IN NATIONAL LEAGUE ONE 
DANNY BROUGH MAN OF THE MATCH BUT 
HALF A DOZEN PLAYERS COULD HAVE 
CLAIMED IT WAS IT WAS GOOD TEAM EFFORT 
JAMIE ROONEY HAS A GOOD EFFORT KICKING GAME DANNY BROUGH DOES 
DESERVE IT 
IT WAS GAME ON FOR THE 
SECOND HALF 
WE KNEW THAT WHICH IS 
WHY WE CAME OUT IN THE SECOND HALF 
AND STARTED PRETTY STRONG WELL WELL DONE FOR SUB A LOT OF MAKE WELL 
DONE DONE THE SALFORD DRESSING ROOM BY 
COMPARISON WILL BE PRETTY QUIET A 
LOT OF PEOPLE FEELING VERY BATTERED 
STEVE MCNAMARA AND KEVIN SINFIELD 
WERE WATCHING IN THE STUDIO RIDE 
FROM THE OFF SUPER LEAGUE SIDES 
ARE JUST TOO STRONG RIGHT FROM 
THE COST THEY DID A GOOD JOB TODAY 
THEIR ENTHUSIASM AND DRIVE TODAY TO GET THEM AND MAKE THE TACKLES 
WAS WHAT SHOWED FOR ME TO GET 
DOWN THERE THEY WERE REALLY 
PASSIONATE AND ENTHUSIASTIC L. 
THOUGHT WAKEFIELD LEAD TODAY THE THE DIFFERENCE IN SIZE AS WELL BETWEEN 
THE TWO SIDES L. DON'T KNOW IF IT 
IS JUST THAT THEY LOOK BIGGER THE THE TEAM IN THE ASCENDANCY TENDS TO 
LOOK AND FEEL BIGGER DANNY 
BROUGH'S KICKING GAME REALLY PUT 
SALFORD ON THE BACK FOOT WAKEFIELD 
WHAT A CLINICAL EFFICIENT 
RUTHLESS PERFORMANCE 
THEY MANAGED 
TO ENSURE THAT SALFORD DID NOT 
SCORE AT ALL IN THE SECOND HALF DANNY BROUGH AND OBST LINKED UP HERE 
A CARBON COPY OF THE SECOND HERE HALF JUST TOO QUICK FOR THE 
MARKERS THERE WERE NUMBERS FLYING 
THROUGH FOR WAKEFIELD WHITE SHIRTS 
COMING EVERYWHERE VERY DIFFICULT 
TO STOP 
IT SHOWS THAT IT IS A 
REALLY SIMPLE GAME RUGBY LEAGUE 
WHEN YOU GET A QUICK PLAYER OF THE 
BALL WE HAVE SEEN FOUR TRIES 
WAKEFIELD HAVE BEEN GREAT AT 
PUSHING THROUGH IN NUMBERS AND IT 
HAS PAID DIVIDENDS TODAY 
IT IS 
ALWAYS SIMPLE WHEN YOU ARE WINNING 
NOT SO GOOD WHEN YOU ARE LOSING 
DID THE ECSTASY BELLEEK PACE AND 
QUALITY DO FOR YOU TODAY 
I THINK 
SO THE EXTRA SUPER LEAGUE PACE 
IT WAS PROBABLY JUST POOR READING 
OF SOME PLAYERS AND OPPORTUNITIES 
THAT PRESENTED THEMSELVES THAT WE 
DID NOT FINISH OFF ALL IN ALL 
THEY WERE TOO CLEVER FOR US AND TOO 
QUICK 
WERE YOU STILL IN IT AT QUICK HALF TIME YOU GOT THE TRY JUST 
BEFORE THE BREAK 
WE WERE 
REASONABLY COMFORTABLE AT TWENTY TWO TO EIGHT WE 
THOUGHT IT WAS SURMOUNTABLE WE I 
THOUGHT WE STARTED THE SECOND HALF 
PRETTY WELL BUT AGAIN ONE OR TWO 
ERRORS AND YOU ARE UNDER PRESSURE 
WAKEFIELD PUNISHED US ON ALMOST 
EVERY OCCASION 
A VIDEO REFEREEING 
DECISION WENT AGAINST YOU IN THE 
FIRST HALF MIGHT THAT HAVE MADE A 
DIFFERENCE WHAT 
WAS YOUR VIEW IT IT WAS PROBABLY A FAIR DECISION L. 
DON'T HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH 
THAT HE WAS LOITERING THERE HE 
WAS WELL IN FRONT OF BYLINE BEFORE 
THE PLAY OFF THE BALL THEY HAD WON 
TURNED AWAY IN A SIMILAR 
CIRCUMSTANCE THE VIDEO REFEREE 
PROBABLY GOT IT RIGHT BUT ON 
ANOTHER GIVEN DAY POSSIBLY BOTH 
WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN AS TRIES 
WHAT DO HAVE TO DO TO GET BACK UP 
TO SUPER LEAGUE STANDARD CLEARLY CLEARLY WE HAVE HAD SOME PRESSURE PUT ON 
TODAY BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE L. HAVE 
GOT A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD HALF BACK WHO 
WILL GET BETTER AND BETTER ROBBIE 
PAUL TOOK A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY 
TODAY MALCOLM TOOK A LOT OF 
RESPONSIBILITY A LOT OF OUR KEY 
POSITIONS STRUGGLED ON THE DATE 
BECAUSE OF THE PACE OF THE GAME 
YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO PLAYING AT 
THIS PACE SOME OF THESE GUYS HAVE 
FORGOTTEN WHAT THAT TEMPO WAS LIKE 
THERE IS A LOT OF SUPER LEAGUE 
EXPERIENCE IN THIS TEAM IT IS NOT 
EASY WHEN YOU ARE NOT PLAYING THAT 
EVERY WEEK COMMISERATIONS COMMISERATIONS SHAUN MCRAE STILL TRYING TO TAKE 
THE BEST OUT OF THAT PERFORMANCE 
THE WAKEFIELD PLAYERS ARE BANGING 
ON THE DOOR LOOK AT THE MUSCLES ON 
SOME OF THOSE GUYS A FEW OF THEM 
ARE OUT THERE WARMING DOWN THEY 
ARE CARRYING A LOT OF INJURIES IN 
THEIR SIDE IT WAS PRETTY 
IMPRESSIVE TO STILL PUT UP 
PERFORMANCE LIKE THAT WHEN THEY ARE 
MISSING ELEVEN FIRST CHOICE PLAYERS 
SEAN GLEESON IS ONLY YOUNG HE GOT 
ON THE END OF TONY MARTIN PASS A A SUPER PASS A GREAT FINISH THERE 
ARE THREE POLICE ANDS PLAYING IN 
THE SUPER LEAGUE ARE NOW THREE 
GLEESONS 
SALFORD COULD NOT SHAKE GLEESONS THEIR OPPORTUNITIES 
IT WAS 
WAKEFIELD'S ENTHUSIASM THE 
WAKEFIELD FANS WERE BEHIND THE POST 
AND REALLY GOT BEHIND THE TEAM IT 
REALLY HELPED THE SALFORD TEAM 
WENT A BIT FLAT TORQUE AT TIMES 
WAKEFIELD WERE GREAT IN DEFENCE 
HAVING SERVED UP THAT PRESSURE 
ONCE THEY GOT THE CHANCE THEY TOOK 
MAKE SURE THEY TOOK IT 
THEY WERE 
RUTHLESS THEY PUSH THROUGH IN 
SUPPORT MAKE THE DEFENDERS ACCOUNT 
FOR HIM HE CREATES THREE PEOPLE 
DOWN THE SHORT SIDE ON TWO 
RATCHFORD PAYS TOO MUCH ATTENTION 
TO ATKINS LEO LATU WAS TOO QUICK 
AGAIN IN A ONE ON ONE SITUATION 
THE SALFORD PLAYERS TRIED TO HOLD 
HIM BUT TOO GOOD FOR HIM IN THE 
END 
THERE IS LEO LATU WARMING DOWN END AND TAKING ON SOME WATER IN CASE 
THERE IS ANY THE HYDRATION GOING ON 
A BIT OF ICE ON THE KNEE INJURED 
PRIDE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR 
ROBBIE PAUL LET'S HEAR FROM HIM 
THEY WERE JUST TOO MUCH FOR YOU 
TODAY 
IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE TODAY SPOKE ABOUT YESTERDAY TALKING 
ABOUT THE SPEED WHICH SUPER LEAGUE 
TEAMS PLAY AT IT WAS A WELCOME 
INTRODUCTION FOR AS TO EXPERIENCE 
THAT ONCE AGAIN A TOUGH DAY AT THE 
OFFICE 
PAY IS WAS A BIG FACTOR IT OFFICE IT WAS WE WON THE TACKLES SPEEDING 
UP THE PLAYER OF THE BALL THE 
QUICK PLAYERS WERE GETTING OUT 
REALLY WELL AND PUTTING US UNDER 
PRESSURE MUCH CREDIT TO THEM YOU YOU HAVE GOT A YOUNG HALF BACK RICHARD
