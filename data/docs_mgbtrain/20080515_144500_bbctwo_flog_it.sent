ROCHESTER IS KNOWN AS THE CITY OF GREAT EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE IT'S IN THAT CHARLES DICKENS NOVEL 
AND I'VE GOT GREAT EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR VALUATION DAY TODAY ON FLOG IT 
CHARLES DICKENS LOVED ROCHESTER WITH ITS QUAINT SHOPS AND HOUSES 
AND THE FEELING IS MUTUAL BECAUSE EVERY YEAR THE LOCALS HOLD TWO FESTIVALS IN HIS HONOUR 
I'VE BEEN TOLD THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE AROUND HERE 
THAT LIKE TO GET DRESSED UP AS DICKENSIAN CHARACTERS 
SO WHO KNOWS WHAT SURPRISES WE'RE GOING TO FIND INSIDE 
LOOKING OUT FOR THE OLD CURIOSITIES ARE OUR MUTUAL FRIENDS PHILIP SERRELL AND ELIZABETH TALBOT 
WE CAN RELY ON THEM NOT TO MISS ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY 
ELIZABETH HAS ALREADY FOUND SOMETHING 
THIS STRIKES ME AS A FLAMBOYANT CLOCK FOR A FLAMBOYANT GENTLEMAN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT 
IT COMES FROM MY WIFE'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY RIGHT 
WE WERE ON THE POINT OF MOVING AND IT FELL OFF THE MANTEL SHELF 
IT GOT A MINOR BIT OF DAMAGE BUT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL OLD CLOCK 
I'M INTERESTED IN CLOCKS BUT I THINK IT'S TIME TO GO 
BEFORE IT FALLS OFF ANOTHER SHELF YEAH 
STRICTLY SPEAKING IT'S A TIMEPIECE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T STRIKE IT TELLS THE TIME ONLY 
IT'S IN A SILVER CASE WHICH IS AS DECORATIVE ON THE BACK 
AS IT IS ON THE FRONT 
SO WHOEVER MADE THIS WAS VERY PROUD AND GOOD AT SHOWING OFF HIS CRAFT 
THE FACE OF IT IS BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED 
WITH THIS LITTLE CHERUBIC FIGURE WISTFULLY LOOKING AT THE SUN 
AS WE'VE BEEN DOING RECENTLY YEAH 
SOME DAMAGE INCLUDING THE LOSS OF THE HANDS BUT IT CAN BE RECTIFIED 
AND THEN THIS VERY SUMPTUOUS RICH CASE 
IT'S FLAT SILVER WHICH WAS STAMPED OUT WITH THIS THREE DIMENSIONAL DESIGN OF SCROLLS AND CHERUBS 
VASES OF FLOWERS ALL VERY VERY RICH AND EXCITING 
FROM A CLOCK SPECIALIST'S POINT OF VIEW THERE'S NOTHING EXCITING 
IT IS JUST A TIMEPIECE BUT IT IS BY THE BRITISH UNITED CLOCK COMPANY 
AND THAT GUARANTEES THE QUALITY OF ITS MANUFACTURE 
SO IT'S A LOVELY ITEM 
I WOULD EXPECT IT TO SELL REALISTICALLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
IT SHOULD BE PROTECTED WITH A RESERVE WHICH I WOULD ADVISE BEING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY IF YOU'RE HAPPY 
MM HMM IT MAY DO MORE BUT I THINK THAT'S A SENSIBLE PRICE FOR YOU 
AND IT'S REALISTIC FOR THE CONDITION IT'S IN 
LOVELY DOES THAT SOUND GOOD YEAH 
AND HAVING SOLD THIS LOVELY ITEM WHICH YOU'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME WHAT MIGHT YOU THEN DO 
I THINK WE MIGHT GO TO PORTSMOUTH AND THE HOME CLUB AND HAVE A SHORT BREAK 
SOUNDS NICE WE'LL SEE WE'LL SEE WHAT WE DO FOR YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
VANESSA HOW ARE YOU DOING ALL RIGHT THAT'S REALLY SWEET H. M. M. 
DO YOU NOT LIKE IT IT'S NOT MY STYLE BUT 
MY MUM AND DAD LIKE IT DID IT COME DOWN THE FAMILY YES 
MY DAD ACQUIRED IT SOMEWHERE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN IN THE FAMILY 
DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD IT IS NO I KNOW IT'S QUITE OLD 
MAYBE VICTORIAN YEAH VICTORIAN 
SECOND HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THE VICTORIANS WERE PROLIFIC IN PRODUCING CRESCENT BROOCHES 
STAR BROOCHES AND TARGET BROOCHES 
ALL IN THIS DESIGN 
THIS IS A LITTLE STAR BROOCH DIAMOND SET IN GOLD 
AND VERY OFTEN THE BROOCHES THAT THEY PRODUCED WOULD HAVE BEEN USED EITHER AS PENDANTS 
SO THIS FITTED ON TO THE END OF A CHAIN OR THEY WERE USED AS A BROOCH 
THIS IS DIAMOND AND GOLD BUT IT'S VERY VERY BLACK YES 
WHY I DON'T KNOW SOMEONE SAID IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO HEAT 
HAS IT BEEN IN A FIRE NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE IT'S JUST BEEN TUCKED AWAY 
THE AUCTIONEERS WILL WEIGH THE DIAMONDS 
WE WEIGH DIAMONDS IN CARATS IT'LL GIVE YOU A MORE ACCURATE VALUATION 
I THINK AT AUCTION THIS WILL SELL QUITE WELL THESE ARE SOUGHT AFTER 
I WOULD THINK THAT IS GONNA MAKE AT AUCTION PROBABLY BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY AND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY LOVELY 
I'D PUT A RESERVE ON IT OF FOUR HUNDRED SO BELOW THAT PRICE YOU HAVE IT BACK 
O. K. THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT WORTH IT IT JUST HASN'T SOLD THAT DAY 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT YES LOVELY 
WHAT WOULD YOU SPEND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY ON 
I'M GOING TO AUSTRALIA TO VISIT MY SISTER NEXT YEAR 
MY MUM WOULD LOVE TO COME WITH ME SO I THINK IT'LL GO TOWARDS THAT 
I DON'T LIKE TO SEE FAMILY THINGS SOLD BUT IN THIS INSTANCE 
IT'D BE WORTH IT I HOPE IT MAKES ONE THOUSAND SO DO I 
WE'VE SEEN MANY PELHAM PUPPETS ON THE SHOW BEFORE SOME OF THEM VERY COLLECTABLE 
BUT WE'VE NEVER SEEN A PELHAM PUPPET LIKE THIS ONE 
IT'S DONALD DUCK AND IT BELONGS TO LYNN THANKS FOR BRINGING HIM IN 
THAT'S O. K. HE'S THE FIRST LARGE PELHAM PUPPET I'VE SEEN 
I'VE READ ABOUT THEM AND I'VE SEEN THEM IN THE BOOKS 
BUT I'VE NOT MET A CHARACTER LIKE THIS ONE AND HE'S VERY HEAVY 
WHAT'S HIS HISTORY I WAS GIVEN HIM FOURTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN MY SON WAS BORN 
BY MY BROTHER IN LAW WHO DID A HOUSE CLEARANCE AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE WITH A YOUNG CHILD IN THE FAMILY 
SO HE GAVE HIM TO ME WAS IT A SON OR A DAUGHTER 
MY SON WHAT'S HIS NAME RYAN 
RYAN'S OBVIOUSLY PLAYED WITH DONALD DUCK AND GONE OOH 
YOU CAN HANG THIS FROM THE CEILING AND HE'LL BOUNCE UP AND DOWN 
I'D HANG IT IN THE DOORWAY INSIDE THE KITCHEN DOOR 
IT JUST KEEPS THEM FOCUSED AND ENTERTAINED PELHAM PUPPETS 
THEY WERE MADE IN MARLBOROUGH WHERE I COME FROM RIGHT 
THE FACTORY WAS JUST UP THE ROAD FROM WHERE I LIVED DID YOU PLAY WITH PELHAM PUPPETS I DID 
PELHAM PUPPETS WERE VERY POPULAR THROUGHOUT THE FIFTIES 
RIGHT THROUGH TO THE MID SIXTIES 
AND THEY HAD THEIR BIG BREAK WHEN HAMLEYS A LONDON TOY SHOP 
TOOK THEIR PRODUCT ON IN ABOUT NINETEEN FIFTY AND MARKETED THEM WORLDWIDE 
IT WAS A GREAT BUSINESS AND THEY DID REALLY WELL IN MARLBOROUGH 
HOW COME THEY STARTED DOING DISNEY ONES I'LL TELL YOU WHY 
THE DEMISE OF THE PELHAM PUPPET WAS WALT DISNEY ANIMATION 
ENTERTAINMENT WAS VERY BASIC 
IT STARTED OFF REALLY WITH MUFFIN THE MULE 
EVERYONE HAD PUPPETS THEN SUDDENLY EVERYBODY STARTED HAVING T. V. SETS 
WALT DISNEY FILMS CAME OUT AND ANIMATION KILLED OFF PELHAM PUPPETS 
RATHER THAN BE BEATEN HE JOINED THE BANDWAGON IF YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM JOIN THEM EXACTLY 
THAT'S THE WAY FORWARD HE MADE A LOT OF CHARACTERS LIKE THIS 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL HIM NOW 
HOPEFULLY HE'LL GO TO SOMEONE THAT KNOWS HOW TO RESTORE HIM 
HE'S JUST BEEN STUCK IN A BOX 
SO I'D RATHER HIM GO TO SOMEONE WHO CAN DO SOMETHING WITH HIM 
THERE ARE A LOT OF PELHAM PUPPET COLLECTORS THEY'LL LIKE THIS ONE 
DONALD DUCK IS A GREAT FAVOURITE 
ANY IDEA OF THE VALUE I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE 
ONE HUNDRED SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE BANG ON 
I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS DO ONE HUNDRED I WAS GOING TO PUT A VALUE OF EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
I KNOW IT'S AN AUCTIONEER'S CLICHE BUT I THINK IT'S HIS MARKET VALUE 
SHALL WE FLOG HIM YEAH I HOPE HE GOES TO A GOOD HOME HE WILL 
I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS LOT GRACE AND BRUCE 
I UNDERSTAND DESPITE THE FACT THIS SERVICE LOOKS SO PRISTINE 
IT'S HAD QUITE A STORY AND HAS TRAVELLED A FAIR WAY YES 
IT WAS ORIGINALLY MADE IN ENGLAND AND SHIPPED TO WHAT WAS RHODESIA 
NOW ZIMBABWE AND FOUR YEARS AGO WE SHIPPED IT BACK AGAIN WITH US 
SO YOU'VE HAD IT OVER FORTY YEARS 
FORTY THREE YEARS IT WAS A WEDDING PRESENT REALLY 
A VERY GENEROUS WEDDING GIFT YES 
SO YOU'VE USED THIS DINNER SERVICE OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE YES 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT'S BEEN NEVER TOUCHED BUT YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY 
IT DOESN'T COME OUT AS OFTEN AS IT USED TO WE DON'T ENTERTAIN AS MUCH 
NOW WE FEEL THAT IT'S A COLLECTABLE ITEM AND PERHAPS WE SHOULD REALISE ITS VALUE 
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THAT IT'S MIDWINTER 
BUT YOU ALSO KNOW ABOUT THE DESIGNER AND THE ARTIST 
N. 
IT'S MADE BY THE MIDWINTER FACTORY AND THEY WERE IN OPERATION 
BETWEEN NINETEEN TEN WHEN IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY WILLIAM MIDWINTER 
AND IT OPERATED RIGHT THROUGH TO ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN 
SOME FAMOUS NAMES BESIDES HUGH CASSON HAVE LINKS WITH THIS FACTORY 
SUCH AS THE YOUNGER TERENCE CONRAN 
SO SOME VERY HIGH FLYING DESIGNERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY HAVE CONTRIBUTED DESIGNS 
DURING THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY JESSIE TAIT WAS COMMISSIONED BY WILLIAM MIDWINTER 
TO CREATE THIS ROUNDED SQUARE SHAPE 
WHICH WAS THEN COPIED BY A LOT OF LESSER FACTORIES 
YOU AND I AGREE THAT IT'S VERY MUCH OF THE PERIOD 
BUT IT LOOKS VERY MUCH NOW AS WELL MODERN YES 
NOW THERE ARE LOTS OF PIECES THIS ISN'T THE WHOLE SET 
WE HAVE THE COMPLETE DINNER SERVICE 
AND THE TEA SET COFFEE SET AND FRUIT SET FOR SIX PEOPLE AMAZING 
TO SEE ONE OR TWO PIECES IS SOMETHING WE MIGHT EXPECT 
BUT TO SEE SO MUCH IN SUCH LOVELY CONDITION IS REALLY EXCITING 
YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT SELLING IT DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT MIGHT FETCH 
OR YOU HOPE IT MIGHT ACHIEVE WE WERE HOPING AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED 
AROUND ABOUT THAT FIGURE THAT FIGURE YES YEAH 
I THINK REALISTICALLY ANYWHERE BETWEEN PROBABLY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY AND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WOULD BE A FAIR BRACKET VALUE YES YES 
BUT I WOULD ADVISE A RESERVE OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WE WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THAT IT'S A WELL KNOWN CANNES PATTERN 
AND IT'S ONE THAT PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING FOR 
SO I THINK IT'S A FAIR ASSESSMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU 
IT'S TIME TO HEAD TO THE SALEROOM 
WHERE THE BIDDERS WILL TAKE A SHINE TO RON'S FLAMBOYANT TIMEPIECE 
AND THE DIAMOND STAR BROOCH IS SURE TO SPARKLE 
BUT WILL THE BIDDERS GO QUACKERS FOR DONALD WHO'S PAST HIS PRIME

I THINK SO IT'S A GOOD QUALITY SERVICE IN WONDERFUL CONDITION 
IT'S AS IF THEY'VE NEVER USED IT IT'S IN MINT CONDITION 
THAT'S WHAT THE COLLECTORS GO FOR IT'S GOT TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION 
THERE ARE A FEW BITS OF CRAZING ON THE PLATE O. K. THE BIG QUESTION

WE'RE GONNA TAKE THAT BRILLIANT THAT'S NOT BAD IS IT 
THAT'S GONNA GET YOU BACK TO SOUTH AFRICA FOR A HOLIDAY 
HAVE A GREAT TIME THANK YOU WHAT A GOOD RESULT I'M SO PLEASED 
THANK YOU A PLEASURE WELL DONE 
OUR LANDSCAPE WOULD LOOK ENTIRELY DIFFERENT IF IT WASN'T FOR BEES 
BEES HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS 
EVEN STONE AGE MAN WOULD CAPTURE WILD BEES FOR THEIR HONEY 
BUT BEES HAVE A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT JOB TO DO 
BEES ARE POLLINATORS WHICH ARE VITAL FOR THE POLLINATION OF PLANTS 
INCLUDING CROPS WE GROW FOR FOOD 
ONE THIRD OF THE HUMAN FOOD SUPPLY DEPENDS MAINLY ON BEES 
NOWADAYS LOTS OF FARMERS HIRE HIVES FROM BEEKEEPERS AND PUT THEM IN THEIR FIELDS BESIDE THEIR CROPS 
TO MAKE SURE THEY GET POLLINATED 
I'VE COME TO FLYNN'S BEE FARM ON THE ISLE OF SHEPPEY 
BEEKEEPER TERRY CLARE WILL TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT AND HOPEFULLY THERE'S NO STING IN THE TAIL 
TERRY THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME DOWN HERE IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE 
I'M QUITE NERVOUS BUT VERY EXCITED 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE FRIGHTENED THE BEES HERE SHOULD BE FAIRLY GENTLE 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A BEEKEEPER I CAME BACK INTO BEEKEEPING IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED APPARENTLY SINCE THE AGE OF SIX 
THAT'S A FEW YEARS NOW I FIND EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW THE BEE WORKS 
HOW ITS SOCIETY OPERATES AND THE FACT IT'S A PROPER COMMUNITY 
HUMAN BEINGS ARE STILL TRIBAL AS YOU CAN SEE FROM FOOTBALL MATCHES 
BEES AREN'T LIKE THAT THEY'RE VERY COMMUNAL AND IT'S AN ENTIRELY FEMINIST SOCIETY 
ALL THE WORKERS ARE FEMALE AND DO ALL THE WORK AND GET THE JOB DONE 
SHALL WE GET BOOTED AND SUITED I THINK SO LET'S GO 
RIGHT 
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN 
RIGHT OFF TO WORK WE GO 
ACTUALLY TERRY IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE CLASSIC BEEHIVE I KNOW AS A SCHOOLBOY 
THE ONE YOU SEE IN WINNIE THE POOH THE SKEP WHY DON'T YOU USE THOSE 
THE SKEP ISN'T EFFICIENT AND YOU CAN'T CONTROL DISEASE AND YOU CAN'T MANIPULATE THE HIVE 
WHEN WE GET INTO THIS ONE WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN THE EARLY THIRTIES 
YOU'LL SEE WHY IT'S SO EASY TO MANIPULATE WHAT'S IN YOUR HAND 
I'VE GOT A SMOKER HERE I'LL GIVE A LITTLE PUFF WHAT DOES THAT DO 
IT MAKES THE BEES QUIETEN DOWN 
THEY THINK SMOKE MEANS FIRE SO THEY FILL THEIR TONGUES WITH HONEY 
IN CASE THEY'VE GOT TO TRAVEL FAR 
WE'LL TAKE THE ROOF OFF AND PUT IT DOWN THERE 
THERE WE HAVE THE BEEHIVE UNDERNEATH WOW LOOK AT THAT 
WHAT'S THE HIERARCHY WHAT'S THEIR WORK ETHIC 
THERE'S ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND WORKERS IN HERE 
ONE QUEEN AND THERE MAY BE ONE HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED DRONES YEAH 
BUT IT'S THE WORKERS WHO DO ALL THE WORK AND DICTATE WHAT HAPPENS 
ALL THE QUEEN DOES IS LAY EGGS AT THIS TIME OF YEAR ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED A DAY THAT MANY 
AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY HOW LONG DO THE EGGS TAKE TO HATCH 
THREE DAYS THAT'S NOT LONG IT'S NOT LONG AT ALL 
IT'S NO WONDER TERRY'S SO FASCINATED BY BEE SOCIETY 
THE FEMALE WORKER BEES COLLECT NECTAR TO BE MADE INTO HONEY AND POLLEN FOR FOOD 
DRONES ARE THE ONLY MALE BEES IN THE HIVE AND MATE WITH THE QUEEN 
SHE THEN LAYS ONE EGG IN EACH CELL TO BE FED BY THE WORKER BEES 
LET'S SEE WHAT'S IN THIS FRAME 
WE'RE SEEING IN THE CELLS WHICH ARE SEALED WORKER LARVAE 
WHICH ARE TURNING INTO ADULT WORKER BEES 
THE SHINY LIQUID IS NECTAR WHICH IS BEING TURNED INTO HONEY 
AND YOU CAN SEE IN SOME PARTS A YELLOW HARD SUBSTANCE 
THAT'S POLLEN THEY NEED THE POLLEN FOR FEEDING THEIR YOUNG AND FOR FEEDING THE QUEEN 
WHAT'S THE LIFESPAN OF A BEE THE WORKER IN THE SUMMER SIX WEEKS 
BUT IN THE WINTER FOUR MONTHS 
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT DOING ANY WORK AS SUCH 
HOW LONG WILL THE QUEEN BEE LIVE FOR FOR FOUR TO FIVE YEARS 
BUT MOST EFFICIENT BEEKEEPERS LET HER LIVE FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS AND THEN HER EGG LAYING DIES OFF 
IS THE QUEEN BEE IN THERE NOW YES 
CAN WE HAVE A LOOK AT HER OF COURSE YOU CAN I'LL TAKE HER OUT 
ARE THEY THREATENED THAT YOU'RE TAKING THE QUEEN OUT THESE BEES ARE CALM AND EASY TO HANDLE 
YOU CAN SEE THE QUEEN DOWN THERE 
SHE'S GOT THE SPOT ON HER BACK CRAWLING ALONG THE BOTTOM 
SHE'S SLIGHTLY BIGGER 
HER ABDOMEN THE BOTTOM THIRD OF HER BODY IS MUCH MUCH LARGER 
THAT'S WHERE ALL THE EGG LAYING IS DONE FROM 
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN A QUEEN BEE SHE'S LOVELY LOOKING 
SHE'S A DARK BEE PURE RACE WHICH THEY USED TO CALL THE BLACK BEE 
YES IT'S NATIVE TO THIS COUNTRY 
IF YOU'D LIKE TO HOLD THAT ONE OH MY WORD HERE GOES 
HOLD IT CAREFULLY LOOK AT THAT 
THESE BEES ARE VERY CALM YOU CAN RUN YOUR HAND OVER AND IT DOESN'T DISTURB THEM 
THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE WHAT A FANTASTIC SIGHT 
HUNDREDS OF BEES THERE ALL HAVING A ROLE TO DO KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
THAT IS A HIVE OF ACTIVITY THOUSANDS OF BEES 
THEY DO HAVE DIFFERENT ROLES 
AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THEIR LIVES THEY PERFORM SPECIFIC JOBS WE EVEN HAVE MORTICIANS UNDERTAKERS 
IT'S A GOOD ILLUSTRATION HOW A PARTICULAR ANIMAL HAS EVOLVED 
TO A HIGHER LEVEL IN SOME RESPECTS THAN HUMAN BEINGS YES 
AND THERE IS AN END PRODUCT WHICH I CAN'T WAIT TO TASTE 
IT'S THE MOMENT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR TO TEST THE END PRODUCT 
I'M SURROUNDED BY ALL SORTS OF HONEYS BUT I'VE SINGLED OUT ONE 
IT'S A PURE HONEY WITH EXTRACT OF CINNAMON IN IT 
I'M GONNA TAKE A LITTLE STRAW AND HAVE A LITTLE DAB OF THIS 
HERE WE GO 
H. M. M. BELIEVE ME THAT IS ABSOLUTELY DIVINE 
THAT'S GOING HOME WITH ME I'VE HAD A GREAT TIME 
BUT IT'S TIME TO BUZZ OFF BACK TO THE VALUATION DAY AND SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING 
SUE BRIAN HUSBAND AND WIFE YES YOU HAVE TO CHECK THESE DAYS 
WHOSE ARE THESE THEY'RE MINE 
HAVE THEY COME DOWN THE FAMILY 
I INHERITED THEM FROM AN AUNT ABOUT FORTY TWO YEARS AGO 
WOULD THE WORLD CAVE IN ON YOU IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE SELLING THEM 
I DON'T THINK SHE'D MIND 
LET'S TURN THEM UP AND SEE WHAT THEY TELL US 
THERE WE ARE WE CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE CROWN DEVON 
HAND PAINTED BY WALTER LAMONBY 
BIZARRELY THIS IS ALL DECORATED WITH THE SAME SCENE 
A HUNTING SCENE WHICH OF COURSE IS NOW BANNED 
YES AND IT'S JOHN PEEL 
WHO WAS A FAMOUS NORTH COUNTRY HUNTSMAN 
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THE FIRST FEW WORDS OF THIS VERSE 
D'YE KEN JOHN PEEL 
SO ALL OF THIS IS BY THEM WE'VE GOT A JUG 
WITH THIS MOULDED DECORATION ALL THE WAY ROUND AND A FOX 
WE'VE GOT A LITTLE TANKARD THAT'S GOT THE HUNTING CROP THERE 
AND AGAIN MOULDED DECORATION 
THEN WE'VE GOT THIS HUNTING SCENE AGAIN WITH JOHN PEEL AND THE FOX 
THIS ONE'S A BIT DIFFERENT YES 
AS IF BY MAGIC 
THIS ONE IS INTERESTING IT'S A MUSICAL DECANTER 
THAT LITTLE SPRIG STOPS IT OR LETS IT PLAY 
IT PLAYS D'YE KEN JOHN PEEL WE'VE GOT THE FULL COMPLEMENT OF JOHN PEEL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH MY HUSBAND THOUGHT HE SAW THIS ONE 
YEAH ON TELEVISION I THINK IT WAS ABOUT SIXTY 
I THINK THAT FOR AUCTION 
WE OUGHT TO ESTIMATE THE THREE PIECES AT ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED 
I THINK IF YOU CAN GET TWO PEOPLE THERE COMPETING AGAINST THEM 
THEY COULD MAKE WELL OVER THE TOP ESTIMATE 
BUT I THINK ONE HUNDRED RESERVE POSSIBLY WITH A LITTLE BIT OF DISCRETION 
HUNTING THINGS DON'T MAKE THE MONEY THEY USED TO PERHAPS FIFTEEN YEARS AGO 
ARE YOU HAPPY TO SELL THEM YES AUNTY WOULDN'T DISAPPROVE NO 
WHAT WOULD YOU SPEND THE MONEY ON WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT 
WE'VE GOT A REPUTATION FOR GETTING LOST WHEN WE TRAVEL WE MIGHT PUT IT TOWARDS SATELLITE NAVIGATION 
I NEARLY ENDED UP IN ROCHDALE INSTEAD OF ROCHESTER WE'RE LOCAL SO WE DIDN'T GET LOST COMING HERE 
ARE YOU HAPPY TO PUT THEM IN YES WE'LL SEE WHAT BENEFIT JOHN PEEL ACTUALLY BRINGS 
SYLVIA WHAT A WONDERFUL PAIR OF EWERS YOU THINK SO 
I'M NOT REALLY VERY FOND OF THEM AT ALL ARE YOU NOT NO 
THEY WERE HANDED DOWN TO US FROM MY HUSBAND'S MOTHER 
WHO RECEIVED THEM FROM AN ELDERLY GERMAN LADY 
WHO WE THINK BROUGHT THEM OUT OF GERMANY DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
RIGHT SHE THEN EMIGRATED TO RHODESIA AS IT THEN WAS 
SUBSEQUENTLY ZIMBABWE WHERE WE'VE COME FROM 
SO THEY'VE DONE A FULL ROUND TRIP 
QUITE INTERNATIONAL GERMANY TO AFRICA AND BACK TO EUROPE 
WHAT DON'T YOU LIKE ABOUT THEM I THINK IT'S THE ANGULAR DESIGN 
I DON'T KNOW REALLY I JUST FOUND THEM RATHER UGLY 
YOU'RE BEING HONEST THAT'S GOOD 
THEY WERE MADE BY 
THE SHORTENED TITLE OF THE FIRM IS WMF WHICH IS A GERMAN FACTORY 
IT WAS A METAL FOUNDRY WHICH OPENED IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTIES 
AND THEY GAINED SUCH A REPUTATION FOR STYLISH DESIGNS 
OF THE ART NOUVEAU INFLUENCE 
WHICH WERE RETAILED THROUGH OUTLETS SUCH AS LIBERTY'S 
STYLISTICALLY ALTHOUGH THEY'RE VERY ANGULAR 
THE KNOP ON THE HANDLE 
THE DESIGNS WHICH RAN ALL THE WAY DOWN SINEWING DOWN TO THE FEET 
THESE SPLAYED FEET 
IS SO VERY ART NOUVEAU 
AND THEY ARE UNUSUAL 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO OF THEM 
VERY OFTEN THEY BECOME SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARTNER AND THEY'RE PEWTER WHICH WAS SILVER PLATED 
IN TERMS OF VALUE IT'S THE LOWER END OF THE TYPE OF METAL THEY USED 
WHEN THEY WERE NEW THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BRIGHT AND SHINY 
ON THE UNDERSIDE YOU CAN SEE THE WMF MARK FOR THE FACTORY 
AND E. P. WHICH MEANS ELECTRO PLATED 
NOW WARES OF THE WMF FACTORY ARE HIGHLY COLLECTABLE 
IF YOU WERE HAPPY TO ENTER THEM WITH A RESERVE OF PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
WHICH MEANS THE ESTIMATE WOULD BE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO FOUR HUNDRED THAT SORT OF LEVEL 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY WITH THAT SAY IF YOU'RE NOT NOT AT ALL 
MY HUSBAND SAID HE WOULD PREFER A RESERVE OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED 
WE DON'T WANT TO TWIST YOUR ARM WE CAN HAVE THREE HUNDRED WITH DISCRETION 
O. K. WE'LL FIND A GOOD HOME FOR THEM THANK YOU THANK YOU 
MICHAEL HOW ARE YOU DOING NOT TOO BAD WHERE DOES THIS COME FROM 
I'VE DONE SOME WORK FOR AN OLD BOY 
GARDENING AND HE GAVE ME THAT 
HOW LONG AGO ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO I QUITE LIKE THIS

THIS IS OF THAT GENRE YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS YEAH A BOAR'S HEAD 
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR PIPE RACK 
YES THESE LITTLE METAL RACKS HERE 
IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE BACK CAN YOU SEE WHERE IT OVERLAPS 
YEAH AND AGAIN JUST THERE THERE'S AN OVERLAP 
BUT I THINK IT PROBABLY DID 
IT'S JUST A SWEET LITTLE THING VERY COMMERCIAL 
HOW MUCH GARDENING DID YOU DO HOW MUCH WERE YOU OWED TWENTY YEARS AGO 
NOT A LOT TEN QUID SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH MAYBE THAT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS WORTH WOULD YOU TAKE THIRTY QUID

BLIMEY IS THAT GOOD EXCELLENT I DIDN'T THINK THAT MUCH DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE THAT MUCH 
HE'S NOT QUITE SUCH A BOAR NOW 
I RECKON AN ESTIMATE OF ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED WE'LL PUT A RESERVE OF EIGHTY 
IF YOU HAVE A RESULT ON THE DAY IT COULD EASILY MAKE TOP END ESTIMATE 
IT'S A REALLY GOOD FUN THING DO YOU LIKE IT YEAH I LIKE IT 
IT WAS JUST LYING ABOUT SO IT'S GOT TO GO 
WHAT WOULD YOU SPEND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY QUID ON I'D TAKE THE FAMILY OUT FOR A MEAL

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS AND I COULD SEE THIS ON MY WALL IN MY HOUSE 
LOVELY PIPE RACK BLACK FOREST CARVING THE BEARS ARE SO POPULAR 
THIS IS A WILD BOAR WE'VE GOT ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED ON IT 
IF THAT WAS MINE I WOULDN'T BE SELLING IT GREAT BIT OF FUN 
BEAUTIFUL CARVING FOR THE CENTRE 
WHAT WE NEED IS TWO PIPE SMOKERS IN THE ROOM BIDDING EACH OTHER UP 
BUT THE DECORATORS WILL LOVE THIS TOO AND IT'S A GREAT TALKING POINT 
IT'S A GREAT BIT OF FUN AND THAT'S WHAT IT WILL BE SOLD AS 
YOU'D HAVE THIS ON YOUR WALL I'D LOVE TO TAKE THAT HOME
