THIS IS JACKANORY 
HELLO I'M MARTIN 
THIS IS THE STORY OF MY TRIP TO THE NORTH POLE 
TO FIND THE LAST POLAR BEARS 
ALL MY LIFE I'VE WANTED TO SEE HOW POLAR BEARS REALLY LIVE 
TO SEE THEM SWIMMING AMONGST THE ICEBERGS AND PLAYING IN THE SNOW 
I REMEMBER GOING TO THE ZOO ONE HOT SUMMER'S AFTERNOON 
AND SEEING MY FIRST POLAR BEAR 
HE WAS SITTING IN THE SHADE OF A DEAD TREE 
THERE WAS A SMALL CONCRETE POOL FOR HIM TO SWIM IN 
THE WATER WAS GREEN 
I LOOKED AT THE POLAR BEAR THERE WAS NO SNOW FOR HIM TO ROLL IN 
NO ICEBERGS FOR HIM TO FLOAT ON 
THAT WAS NO LIFE FOR A POLAR BEAR 
I COULDN'T SAVE HIM HOW COULD I 
YOU CAN HARDLY SMUGGLE A POLAR BEAR UNDER YOUR COAT CAN YOU 
I DECIDED I'D GO TO THE NORTH POLE AND SEE HOW THE POLAR BEARS LIVE 
I WENT TO THE LIBRARY AND I READ ALL ABOUT POLAR BEARS 
WHERE THEY LIVE WHAT THEY EAT 
AND HOW TO LOOK FOR THEM IN REMOTE PLACES 
I STUDIED MANY MAPS 
UNTIL ONE DAY IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM 
I FOUND THE MAP OF GREAT BEAR RIDGE 
I KNEW THEN THAT'S WHERE I'D FIND THE LAST POLAR BEARS 
I BEGAN TO PLAN AN EXPEDITION I DECIDED AFTER A LOT OF THOUGHT 
TO TAKE ROO WITH ME AND A GOLF TROLLEY AS A SLEDGE 
I COULDN'T AFFORD TO FEED HUSKIES 
ROO SAID THAT HER BREED WAS BETTER THAN HUSKIES ON THE SNOW 
BUT THAT NO ONE HAD EVER GIVEN THEM THE CHANCE TO PROVE IT 
WHEN I TOLD HER THAT OUR EXPEDITION WAS TO THE NORTH POLE 
SHE SAID THAT ONE OF HER RELATIONS HAD HELPED TO PUT IT UP 
I LOADED THE GOLF TROLLEY WITH EVERYTHING WE'D NEED 
AND WE CREPT OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SET SAIL FOR THE POLE ON A SHIP 
CALLED THE UNSINKABLE OUR CABIN HAD TWO PORTHOLES 
ONE FOR ROO AND ONE FOR ME 
I SAW A LOT OF SEAGULLS AND A PORPOISE 
AND ROO SAID SHE SAW A SHEEP ROO'S NOT A VERY GOOD SAILOR 
SHE SAYS DOGS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ON BOATS 
I TOLD HER SOME BOATS HAVE A CAT ON BOARD TO KILL RATS 
ROO SAID ANYTHING A CAT CAN DO A DOG CAN DO BETTER 
AND DOGS ARE FAMOUS FOR BEING GREAT SAILORS 
SHE SAID HER GRANDFATHER WAS THE CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND KILLED RATS 
HE PROBABLY DID I SAID 
ROO ASKED IF SHE COULD HAVE A GO AT STEERING THE SHIP 
FOR HALF AN HOUR WE WENT ROUND IN CIRCLES 
ROO SAID DOGS ALWAYS STEER SHIPS IN THIS WAY 
THE CAPTAIN WAS WORRIED ABOUT ROCKS SO HE TOOK OVER 
AND WE CONTINUED TO THE NORTH POLE 
IT WAS A LONG WAY TO THE NORTH POLE 
WE SAILED THROUGH STORMS HIGH SEAS AND IT GREW COLDER AND COLDER 
ROO WORE MY SOCKS TO KEEP HER PAWS WARM 
EVERY DAY SHE ASKED IF WE WERE THERE YET 
EVERY DAY I HAD TO TELL HER NOT YET BUT SOON VERY SOON 
IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE NORTH POLE AND I NEEDED TO KEEP HER SPIRITS UP 
THE SEA IS SUCH A BIG PLACE SEEMS TO GO ON FOREVER 
WE DID SEE LAND YESTERDAY THE CAPTAIN POINTED OUT SHETLAND 
BUT HE DIDN'T STOP HE SAID WE HAD TO MAKE GOOD TIME 
BEFORE THE BAD WEATHER 
COURSE I NEVER MENTIONED THE BAD WEATHER TO ROO MIGHT UPSET HER 
SHE'D BEEN A NUISANCE I'M AFRAID 
AND I WAS WONDERING IF IT WAS SUCH A GOOD IDEA TO BRING HER ALONG 
I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE USEFUL PULLING THE TROLLEY 
PERHAPS I SHOULD'VE BROUGHT A HUSKY 
ROO ANNOUNCED SHE'D CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT FINDING THE LAST POLAR BEARS 
AND SHE'D DECIDED TO GO HOME SHE SAID SHE'D BEEN MISTAKEN 
IT WAS WASN'T SNOW SHE WAS GOOD ON IT WAS SAND 
I SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GO BACK NOW AND WE JUST HAD TO PRESS ON 
ROO SAID THAT DOGS WERE EXCELLENT SWIMMERS AND THAT SHE'D SWIM BACK 
I HAD TO TIE HER TO THE MAST I WAS FRIGHTENED SHE MIGHT TRY IT 
SHE HOWLED ALL AFTERNOON UNTIL I UNTIED HER 
ONE NIGHT ROO INSISTED ON SLEEPING IN A HAMMOCK 
I DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA BUT SHE SAID HER GRANDFATHER 
SLEPT IN ONE ALL THE TIME HE WAS AT SEA 
I FINALLY AGREED BUT I WARNED HER NOT TO STAND UP IN THE HAMMOCK 
SHE IGNORED ME COMPLETELY AND FELL OUT ONTO THE FLOOR 
I WISH SHE'D SLEEP IN HER BASKET LIKE A NORMAL DOG 
LATER THAT NIGHT THE SHIP TOOK A REAL POUNDING FROM A DREADFUL STORM 
THE ENGINE STOPPED COMPLETELY 
AND WHEN THE CAPTAIN TRIED TO GET IT GOING AGAIN NOTHING HAPPENED 
UNTIL ROO HELPED 
AT LAST WE LANDED AT WALRUS BAY 
HOORAH THE CAPTAIN WISHED ME LUCK 
AND HE GAVE ROO A TIN OF MACARONI CHEESE 
HE REALLY LIKED HER WAS SAD TO SEE HIM GO 
WE WERE WELCOMED INTO WALRUS BY HUNDREDS OF PENGUINS 
BUT NO POLAR BEARS WHEE 
OUR CABIN STOOD ON A HILL JUST OUTSIDE WALRUS 
IT WAS VERY DIRTY INSIDE AND IT SEEMED GLOOMY 
BUT WE CLEANED IT UP IT WASN'T MUCH BUT IT WAS HOME 
OUR FIRST NIGHT AT THE NORTH POLE WAS VERY COLD 
ROO WOULDN'T SLEEP IN HER BASKET AND GOT INTO MY BED 
HER PAWS STUCK INTO ME 
AND SHE FIDGETED I HARDLY SLEPT A WINK 
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE A WOLF SAT ON OUR ROOF AND HOWLED ALL NIGHT 
THE NEXT DAY I WANTED TO BEGIN OUR SEARCH FOR THE POLAR BEARS 
BUT THE SNOW KEPT ON FALLING 
IT SNOWED SO MUCH THAT IT NEARLY BURIED OUR CABIN 
FOR THREE DAYS WE WERE COOPED UP AND OUR FUEL RAN LOW 
I HAD TO BURN THE CHAIRS AND ROO'S BASKET TO KEEP US WARM 
ROO WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT HER BASKET SHE WANTED TO KEEP THINGS IN IT 
I SAID IT WAS A PITY SHE HADN'T SLEPT IN IT 
I SOMETIMES WISHED I HAD BROUGHT A HUSKY 
I TRIED TO SLEEP BUT WAS WOKEN BY WOLVES RUNNING ACROSS THE ROOF 
ROO SAID SHE WAS TIRED OF LOOKING FOR POLAR BEARS 
AND WANTED TO GO HOME 
AT LAST IT STOPPED SNOWING 
AND I TOOK ROO OUT TO A PLACE CALLED THE GENTLE SLOPES 
THERE SHE COULD PRACTICE PULLING THE GOLF TROLLEY IN THE SNOW 
HOWEVER HALFWAY UP THE SLOPE ROO DECIDED SHE WANTED TO GO DOWN 
AND TOOK OFF DRAGGING MY GOLF TROLLEY BEHIND HER 
I WAS SO ANGRY WITH ROO THAT WHEN WE GOT HOME I DIDN'T SPEAK TO HER 
SHE LOOKED SO SORRY I HAD TO TELL HER 
THE GREAT BEAR RIDGE ICE CREAM STORY TO CHEER HER UP 
ONCE UPON A TIME I TOLD HER THE SNOW WAS SO PURE AND CLEAN 
THAT IT TASTED BETTER THAN THE FINEST ICE CREAM 
BUT AS THE AIR GOT DIRTIER FROM ALL THE CHEMICAL AND FUMES 
THE SNOW LOST ITS TASTE 
THE LAST OF THE WORLD'S ICE CREAM LAY ON THE GREAT BEAR RIDGE 
THAT'S WHY WE WERE GOING THERE TO GET ICE CREAM FOR ROO 
ROO LOVED THIS STORY I TOLD IT TO HER MANY TIMES 
I MUST ADMIT I ADDED BITS 
THE FABULOUS CHOCOLATE MINT CHIP THAT GROWS IN THE SHADE 
OR THE DELICIOUS STRAWBERRY SPLIT FOUND AT SUNSET 
THESE WERE MY INVENTIONS 
AFTERWARDS ROO FELT MUCH BETTER AND WAS VERY KEEN TO GET UP THERE 
THAT AFTERNOON WE WENT DOWN TO WALRUS TO STOCK UP 
ON PROVISIONS FOR OUR JOURNEY TO FIND THE POLAR BEARS 
WE SPENT A LONG TIME SEARCHING FOR THE SHOPS BURIED IN THE SNOW 
EVENTUALLY WE FOUND THE MAILING STATION 
AFTER ROO FELL DOWN THE CHIMNEY 
I BOUGHT A PAIR OF WELLIES FISH CHEESE CANDLES AND SAUSAGES 
ROO BOUGHT A PICTURE OF A RABBIT AN OLD BONE AND SOME JAM LABELS 
I WISH SHE WOULDN'T WASTE HER MONEY 
THEN I PLAYED GOLF ON THE SNOW FIELDS BEHIND WALRUS 
I FOUND THAT GOLF KEPT MY SPIRITS UP 
MY FIRST SHOT WENT INTO THE SEA THE SECOND WENT DOWN A CREVASSE 
LOW ON GOLF BALLS I DECIDED TO PLAY ONE LAST BALL BEFORE I PACKED IT IN 
I TOOK MY AIM AT THE RED FLAG 
KEPT MY EYE ON THE BALL AND GAVE IT A MIGHTY THWACK WITH MY ONE IRON 
THE BALL ROSE HIGH INTO THE BLUE SKY 
HUNG STILL FOR A MOMENT AS IF DECIDING WHAT TO DO 
AND THEN FELL IN A GRACEFUL ARC OUT OF SIGHT BEYOND THE CREVASSES 
IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT SHOT 
AND I SET OFF AFTER IT TO PLAY THE NEXT 
I WENT CAREFULLY PAST THE CREVASSES 
FALL DOWN THERE YOU'RE A GONER 
THEN IN THE DISTANCE I SPIED A SMALL BLACK SHAPE LYING IN THE SNOW 
AS I GOT CLOSER I REALISED THAT IT WAS A LITTLE PENGUIN 
UNCONSCIOUS BUT STILL ALIVE 
AND BESIDE IT LAY MY GOLF BALL 
MY BALL HAD HIT HIM ON THE HEAD 
I WRAPPED THE PENGUIN UP IN MY COAT ZIPPED IT UP IN MY GOLF BAG 
AND SET OFF BACK TO THE CABIN VERY QUICKLY 
I LAID IT BY THE STOVE IN A BOX TO KEEP WARM 
ROO WAS VERY ANNOYED AND SAID 
WHY DIDN'T I INVITE THE WHOLE ARCTIC AND BE DONE WITH IT 
WE COULD FILL THE PLACE WITH ANIMALS 
AND WE COULD SLEEP OUTSIDE WE DIDN'T SPEAK AGAIN THAT NIGHT 
HIP HIP HURRAH AND THREE CHEERS 
THE NEXT MORNING THE LITTLE PENGUIN HAD WOKEN UP 
IT HAD A BUMP ON ITS HEAD BUT APART FROM THAT IT WAS FINE 
IT ATE SIX DRIED FISH AND WENT BACK TO SLEEP 
WHEN I WENT TO GET WOOD FOR THE STOVE 
IT STRUCK ME THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG 
AT FIRST I COULDN'T DECIDE WHAT WAS WRONG THEN I NOTICED THE SKY 
ONE HALF OF IT WAS A DEEP BLUE AND THE OTHER WAS BRIGHT YELLOW 
BUT EVEN STRANGER THAN THAT WAS THE SUN AND THE MOON 
THEY WERE SIDE BY SIDE THE SUN HAD RISEN AS IT ALWAYS DOES 
BUT THE MOON HADN'T GONE LIKE IT DOES DURING THE DAY IT HAD STAYED 
I RUSHED BACK INTO THE CABIN AND THEN I NOTICED THE CALENDAR 
IT SAID THAT TODAY WAS THE THIRTY SECOND OF OCTOBER 
WHICH COULDN'T BE RIGHT AS OCTOBER ONLY HAS THIRTY ONE DAYS 
AND THAT DAY SHOULD BE THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER 
SOMETHING STRANGE WAS HAPPENING THOUGH 
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD SET OFF BEFORE IT GET ANY STRANGER 
AFTER HARNESSING ROO UP TO THE TROLLEY I CLOSED THE CABIN 
AND SET OFF AT ONCE TO THE GENTLE SLOPES 
I DIDN'T LOOK BACK IN CASE I CHANGED MY MIND 
BY LUNCHTIME WE REACHED THE GENTLE SLOPES AND STARTED THE LONG CLIMB 
I LOOKED BACK AND SAW THE CABIN A TINY SPECK IN THE DISTANCE 
AND IT BROUGHT A LUMP TO MY THROAT ROO PULLED THE TROLLEY QUICKLY 
NO DOUBT DRIVEN BY THE THOUGHT OF ICE CREAM 
AND SO BY TEATIME WE WERE HALFWAY UP TO THE TOP 
WE STOPPED AND PITCHED A TENT CRAWLED INSIDE AND LIT THE STOVE 
AND AFTER A LARGE MEAL WE GOT INTO OUR SLEEPING BAGS 
PENGUIN DIDN'T AS HE'S USED TO SLEEPING WITHOUT ONE 
DISASTER STRUCK THE NEXT MORNING 
WHEN A LARGE GUST OF WIND BLEW THE TENT AWAY 
WE WATCHED IT FLOAT OFF OVER BLUE WHALE BAY 
FORTUNATELY I'D TAKEN THE SLEEPING BAGS OUT 
OR IT WOULD'VE BEEN A COMPLETE DISASTER 
WE CARRIED ON UP THE GENTLE SLOPES THE WIND STARTED TO BLOW HARDER 
I TIED US ALL TO A PIECE OF ROPE SO THAT NONE OF US WOULD BLOW AWAY 
WE MADE SLOW PROGRESS AT TIMES BEAR RIDGE SEEMED TO GET CLOSER 
BUT JUST AS I THOUGHT WE'D REACH IT IT'D GET FURTHER AWAY AGAIN 
LIKE THOSE MIRAGES YOU GET IN THE DESERT 
THE SKY CHANGED FROM LILAC TO A DEEP CRIMSON AND IT STARTED TO SNOW 
WE STOPPED AND MADE AN IGLOO 
CUTTING OUT SNOW WITH MY ONE IRON TO MAKE THE WALLS 
THE WIND GREW MORE FIERCE AND WE JUST FINISHED WHEN THE STORM HIT 
IT BLEW THE TROLLEY IN THE AIR TAKING ROO WITH IT 
I JUST MANAGED TO CATCH ONE OF THE WHEELS AND PULL HER BACK DOWN 
I GRABBED HER IN MY ARMS UNDID THE HARNESS 
AND THE TROLLEY FLEW OFF DOWN THE MOUNTAIN 
WE WERE SO HUNGRY AND OUR FOOD HAD BLOWN AWAY 
BUT THEN ROO BROUGHT OUT THE TIN OF MACARONI THAT THE CAPTAIN GAVE HER 
WHAT A CLEVER DOG 
AFTER EATING IT WE HUDDLED TOGETHER IN MY SLEEPING BAG TO KEEP WARM 
MEANWHILE THE STORM GOT MORE AND MORE FIERCE 
IN THE WIND I'M SURE I HEARD VOICES 
I THOUGHT I HEARD THE WOLVES HOWLING 
THE THREE OF US HUDDLED TOGETHER AND SUDDENLY THE STORM STOPPED 
WE ALL CRAWLED OUT OF THE IGLOO 
I ONLY TOOK MY ONE IRON AND A FEW GOLF BALLS 
WE WALKED THE LAST BIT TO THE GREAT BEAR RIDGE UNDER THE WARM SUN 
PENGUIN WALKED BESIDE ME WHILE ROO RAN ON AHEAD AS DOGS ALWAYS DO 
AND AT LAST WE REACHED THE TOP 
AND THEN WE SAW THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SIGHT 
THE LAST POLAR BEARS WERE THERE 
PLAYING WITH THEIR CUBS ROLLING IN THE SNOW FLOATING ON ICEBERGS 
BYE
