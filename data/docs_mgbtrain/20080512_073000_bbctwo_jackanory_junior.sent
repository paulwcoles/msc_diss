THIS IS JACKANORY JUNIOR 
HELLO 
I'M SALLY 
WHEN YOU'RE SMALL EVERYTHING CAN SEEM VERY BIG AND SCARY 
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU TWO STORIES ABOUT LITTLE PEOPLE 
THE FIRST ONE IS ALL ABOUT HUMPTY DUMPTY'S SHY LITTLE SISTER DIMITY 
THE DUMPTY FAMILY WERE PART OF A TRAVELLING CIRCUS 
ALONG MANY ROADS THEY BUMPED DOWN ICY WINTER HIGHWAYS 
AND UP SUMMER COUNTRY LANES 
AS HE GREW HUMPTY TURNED INTO SOMETHING OF A TEARAWAY 
SIT DOWN HUMPTY HIS MUM OFTEN SAID TO HIM 
ONE DAY YOU'LL COME A CROPPER 
DIMITY GREW TOO 
UNLIKE HER BROTHER SHE WAS AS TIMID AS A FIELDMOUSE 
HER SMALL VOICE LOST ITSELF 
IN THE NOISE OF THE WHEELS AND THE DUST OF THE ROAD 
BUT IT WAS IN THE DUST THAT ONE DAY A GIFT LAY WAITING FOR HER 
IT WAS HER FATHER DOMINIC WHO FOUND THE OLD PEN 
HE REMOVED THE CASE AND FROM THE INSIDE 
MADE HER A LITTLE SILVER FLUTE 
DIMITY'S FIRST NOTES WERE SOFT AS A BREEZE 
THERE WAS ALWAYS MUCH TO DO WHEN THE CIRCUS CAME TO TOWN 
THE HEN HAD TO BE FED AND WATERED THE ROPES PULLED PEGS HAMMERED IN 
THE BIG TOP TO GO UP AND THERE WERE SHOWS TO BE PERFORMED 
DIMITY WATCHED HER FAMILY APPLY THE PAINT 
WON'T YOU JOIN US HONEY ASKED HER MUM BEFORE EACH SHOW 
EVERY TIME DIMITY SHOOK HER HEAD 
NO THANK YOU SHE REPLIED 
AT SHOW TIME THE TUMBLING DUMPTYS BROUGHT THE CROWD TO ITS FEET 
WITH BREATHTAKING DISPLAYS OF DANGER 
TO DIMITY IN THE SHADOWS BELOW HER MOTHER LOOKED BEAUTIFUL 
TRANSFORMED LIKE A BUTTERFLY 
BUT AS THE CROWD ROARED 
AND THE SPOTLIGHT PUSHED LIKE A BRIGHT FINGER ACROSS THE TENT 
SHE WOULD LOOK FOR A QUIETER PLACE 
UP ABOVE THE CIRCUS GROUND SHE BLEW HER SILVER FLUTE 
ONE HOT SUMMER DAY WHEN HUMPTY'S TUMBLE WAS OVER 
AND THEIR PARENTS WERE STILL SPINNING AT THE TOP OF THE TENT 
HUMPTY AND DIMITY OPENED THE ROOF OF THE CARAVAN 
DIMITY'S FINGERS FOUND A LITTLE COOL TUNE ON HER FLUTE 
HUMPTY'S FINGERS FOUND HIS MUM'S LIPSTICK 
THAT'S NOT TOO CLEVER HUMPTY GASPED DIMITY WHEN SHE SAW HIM 
WHEN THEIR PARENTS RETURNED 
MOISTURE STILL DRYING ON THEIR HOT SHELLS 
DOROTHY'S FINGER QUIVERED 
YOU CLEAN IT OFF OR TROUBLE WILL COME KNOCKING AT YOUR DOOR 
TROUBLE DID COME CALLING THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON 
WHEN HUMPTY ONCE MORE WITH TIME ON HIS HANDS 
FOUND A SPRAY CAN BY THE OLD WALL 
HUMPTY CLIMBED ONTO THE WALL 
CRASH 
SOLDIERS AND THEIR HORSES WERE NO HELP AT ALL 
IT'S ONLY AN EGG THEY RETURNED TO THEIR BARRACKS 
FAR AWAY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CIRCUS 
DIMITY HEARD A TREMOR IN THE WIND 
AND FELT A FLUTTER IN HER LITTLE SHELL 
SHE PICKED UP HER SKIRTS AND RAN 
SHE TRIED TO STOP PASSERS BY 
PLEASE HELP MY BROTHER BUT NOBODY HEARD HER 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO DO 
ONCE MORE SHE RAN DIMITY REACHED THE TENT 
SLOWLY SHE CREPT INSIDE AND FOUND HER VOICE 
AND HELP CAME IMMEDIATELY 
WITH DIMITY LEADING THE WAY TO RESCUE HUMPTY 
IN HOSPITAL HUMPTY RECEIVED LOTS OF VISITORS AND CHOCOLATES 
EVEN THE SOLDIERS CAME WHEN THEY HEARD IT ON THE RADIO 
WE ARE SORRY HUMPTY HOW CAN WE MAKE UP FOR THIS THEY ASKED 
A RIDE ON YOUR HORSE WHEN I GET OUT 
A BIG CHEER FOR DIMITY 
AND ALL THE CHOCOLATES SHE CAN EAT SAID A CLOWN 
SOMEWHERE DOWN BEHIND HER MOTHER'S SKIRTS DIMITY BLUSHED 
DIMITY IS STILL SHY AND TIMID AS A FIELD MOUSE 
SHE HAS NEVER RETURNED TO THE SPOTLIGHT 
NOR JOINED THE TUMBLING DUMPTYS 
BUT SHE HAS CHANGED 
AND THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE AROUND THE CIRCUS TOO 
IN THE MORNINGS 
WHEN THE BRIGHT LIGHTS FROM LAST NIGHT'S SHOW ARE ONLY A MEMORY 
DIMITY'S SLIVER FLUTE CAN BE HEARD 
IN THE SUNLIGHT AND THE SHADOWS OF THE CIRCUS GROUND 
THE HIGH NOTES FLY LIKE SWIFTS ON A SUMMER'S MORNING 
AND THE LOW NOTES WHISPER LIKE WIND IN THE PINE TREES 
DIMITY'S TUNES CAN STILL BE HEARD RIGHT ACROSS THE CIRCUS GROUND 
THEY SPARKLE LIKE SUN ON THE WATER 
IT'S THE MUSIC OF THE HEAVENS SAYS THE RINGMASTER 
LET THE TENT COME DOWN BUT ALL IN GOOD TIME 
ONLY WHEN SHE CAN PLAY NO MORE DOES THE TENT COME DOWN 
UNTIL THE NEXT STOP AND THE NEXT SHOW SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD 
AS FOR HUMPTY HE MADE A FULL RECOVERY 
AND HAS PUT AWAY HIS SPRAY CAN 
HE'S NOW ON THE TRAPEZE WITH THE TUMBLING DUMPTYS 
AND RIDES THE SOLDIER'S HORSE IN AN ACT OF HIS OWN 
THIS STORY IS ABOUT SOME CREATURES WHO WERE EVEN SMALLER THAN DIMITY 
THEY FIRST APPEARED IN THE GARDEN OF A LITTLE GIRL CALLED ANNABELLE 
THEY WERE A FAMILY OF FAIRIES 
IT'S CALLED JETHRO BYRDE FAIRY CHILD 
ANNABELLE'S DAD HAD LITTLE TIME FOR FAIRIES 
SADLY ANNIE HE SAID 
YOU WON'T FIND FAIRIES IN CEMENT AND WEEDS SO FAR AS I KNOW 
ANNABELLE HAD LOTS OF TIME 
AND EVERY DAY SHE LOOKED 
EVEN UNDER HER BROTHER SAM 
ON SATURDAY SOMETHING BOUNCED OFF THE SERVICE STATION DRIVEWAY 
AND HIT THE FENCE 
THERE SHE MET A BOY AS BIG AS HER FINGER 
HIS WINGS SHIVERED IN THE BREEZE 
WHO ARE YOU SHE SAID 
JETHRO BYRDE 
I'M A FAIRY CHILD 
WHAT ANNABELLE SAW NEXT MADE HER HOLD HER BREATH 
A ROAD SIDE HOT DOG VAN DROPPED FROM THE SKY 
AND LAY AMONG THE BOTTLES AND CANS 
A FAMILY OF FAIRIES HEAVED AND PUSHED 
HELP US HERE PLEASE CAME A VOICE FROM THE WEEDS 
ANNABELLE GENTLY PUT OUT HER HAND TO SET THE VAN BACK ON ITS WHEELS 
THANKS SAID THE VOICE 
TO WHOM DO WE OWE THIS PLEASURE 
JETHRO'S DAD OFFIN BYRDE BOWED DEEPLY FROM THE WAIST 
HE MEANS WHAT'S YOUR NAME SAID JETHRO

SHE KISSED ANNABELLE ON THE CHEEK 
THAT WAS ONE OF OFFIN'S NOT SO GOOD LANDINGS SAID GRANDMA BYRDE

MY MUM WILL MAKE YOU TEA ANNABELLE SAID 
LILLY'S BELLS AND BANGLES TINKLED AROUND HER ANKLES

LET'S GO SAID JETHRO 
HE DID A BACKWARD AIR SKID OVER THE FENCE 
MUMMY AND DADDY THIS IS JETHRO BYRDE

WELL WE MUST MAKE THEM WELCOME AND MAKE THEM SOME TEA SAID MUM 
BUT SHE WAS LOOKING THE WRONG WAY

I THINK I CAN ANNIE I THINK HE'S ON THE FENCE 
WHY DOESN'T MY DAD SEE YOU ANNABELLE ASKED LILLY 
HE'S TOO GROWN UP ANNABELLE SHE REPLIED

OR MAYBE THEY HAVE A MAGIC WAND

THE BYRDES SHOOK THEIR HEADS 
WE JUST MAKE HAMBURGERS SAID OFFIN BYRDE 
ANNABELLE'S MUM BROUGHT FAIRY CAKES AND CHAMOMILE TEA IN FAIRY CUPS 
ANNABELLE GAVE CAKE TO ALL HER GUESTS 
OFFIN BYRDE'S FOOT BEGAN TO TAP 
HE WIPED HIS FINGERS AND REACHED FOR HIS BAG 
INSIDE WAS A TINY FIDDLE 
THAT AFTERNOON FOR ANNABELLE TIME STOOD STILL 
LILLY DANCED WITH HER CHARMS AND BRACELETS TINKLING LIKE WIND CHIMES 
BABY CECILY SLEPT SOUNDLY WHILE GRANDMA SANG A SLOW SAD SONG 
CLEAR AS A CHURCH BELL 
WE MUST GO OFFIN SAID AT LAST 
ANNABELLE'S HANDS FLEW TO HER FACE 
OH BUT YOU CAN'T SHE SAID OH YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY 
SHE ADDED GO I MEAN

AND I HAVE TO RUN IN THE RACES AND I ALWAYS COME LAST 
AND I DON'T WANT TO GO 
MAYBE JETHRO COULD STAY WITH ME ANNABELLE SAID 
WE NEED YOU JETHRO SAID LILLY 
TO HELP MAKE THE ICE CREAMS 
JETHRO SULKED A BIT 
THEN HE SAID MAYBE ANNABELLE COULD COME WITH US 
I WOULD LOVE TO COME SAID ANNABELLE 
PLEASE TAKE ME WITH YOU 
THE BYRDES WHISPERED TOGETHER 
FINALLY JETHRO TOOK SOMETHING OFF HIS WRIST 
IT'S FOR YOU ANNABELLE OFFIN SAID 
IT'S A FAIRY WATCH TELLING FAIRY TIME 
AND TIME GOES SLOWLY BY FOR FAIRIES SAID GRANDMA 
WE'RE SORRY WE CAN'T TAKE YOU WITH US LILLY WENT ON 
BUT FAIRIES ARE THIS SIZE AND HUMANS ARE

THE FAIRY WATCH FITTED EXACTLY ROUND HER FINGER 
I'M SURE WE WILL JETHRO REPLIED 
JUST DON'T FORGET TO WIND THE WATCH 
AND KEEP LOOKING SAID LILLY 
ANNABELLE CAREFULLY PUT THE VAN ON THE DRIVEWAY 
THE ENGINE COUGHED AND SPLUTTERED 
WILD FLOWERS BURST FROM THE TAILPIPE 
THE VAN CLEARED THE SERVICE STATION ROOF 
AND HEADED WEST INTO THE GATHERING DUSK 
LOOK AT MY RING DADDY 
IT'S A FAIRY WATCH TELLING FAIRY TIME SAID ANNABELLE 
OH THAT'S LOVELY ANNIE REPLIED HER DAD 
HE SAW NOTHING BUT BABY SAM DID 
HIS FINGERS LEFT CAKE AND ICING ON THE GLASS 
I DID FIND FAIRIES IN OUR CEMENT AND WEEDS MUMMY SAID ANNABELLE 
AND THAT NIGHT THE WATCH STRAPPED TIGHTLY AROUND HER FINGER 
ANNABELLE SAW MORE FAIRIES 
FROM RICH HOUSES POOR HOUSES CARAVANS AND CAR PARKS 
THEY RODE IN THE MOONLIGHT TO THE FAIRY TRAVELLER'S PICNIC 
LONG AFTER SHE FELL ASLEEP 
THEIR BUSY CHATTERING AND THE BUZZING OF THEIR WINGS 
AND THEIR FARAWAY MUSIC FILLED HER DREAMS 
SO WATCH OUT FOR FAIRIES WON'T YOU 
SEE YOU AGAIN
