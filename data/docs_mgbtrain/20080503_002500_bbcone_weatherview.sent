THEY BELIEVE A DEAD MAN'S SPIRIT CAN COME AFTER THEM FROM THE GRAVE 
IT'S ME YOU'RE TALKING TO GRACE IT'S ME 
SOMETHING HORRIBLE'S HAPPENED HERE 
AGH YOU ALL RIGHT 
BLOOD WAS FOUND ON A SHAWL THAT WAS AT THIS GRAVE O. K. 
HATRED DOESN'T BIND IT EATS AWAY IT DESTROYS LISTEN TO THIS 
SIR 
GOOD EVENING 
THE WEEKEND IS UPON US AND IT LOOKS LIKE A MIXED BAG ACROSS BRITAIN 
NO ONE LOCATION WILL SEE TWO FINE DAYS OVER THE EXTENDED WEEKEND 
THINGS WILL TURN A LITTLE WARMER THAN WE'VE SEEN OF LATE 
THE REASON FOR THE UNCERTAINTY COMES FROM THIS AREA OF CLOUD 
ALL TIED IN WITH LOW PRESSURE AND ITS ATTENDANT FRONTS 
WHICH WILL INITIALLY START THE WEEKEND ON THE WESTERN SIDE 
OF THE BRITISH ISLES BUT WE WILL SEE SOME EVEN HANDEDNESS 
SIMPLY BECAUSE THESE FRONTS WILL TUMBLE EVER FURTHER EAST 
FOR TONIGHT MUCH OF THE ACTIVITY IN THE WEST WILL BE IN THE NORTH EAST CORNER OF SCOTLAND 
IT WILL BE A MILD NIGHT 
A GREY START CLOSE TO THE FRONT AND A WET ONE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
THOUGH MUCH OF THE RAIN AT THIS STAGE WILL BE LIGHT AND PATCHY 
THE ODD MODERATE BURST OVER THE HILLS AND OVER WESTERN SCOTLAND 
FURTHER TO THE EAST IN SCOTLAND THERE MAY BE SUNSHINE IN THE FAR NORTH EAST 
AND MAYBE INTO THE BORDERS 
THE FURTHER EAST IN ENGLAND 
THE MORE LIKELY YOUR DAY WILL START DRY AND BRIGHT 
WITH SOME SUNSHINE AROUND 
IN THE WEST THE SUNSHINE IS HAZY UNTIL WE GET TO THE SOUTH WEST 
WHERE THERE MAY BE SUFFICIENT CLOUD TO GIVE YOU ODD RAIN AND DRIZZLE 
IT WON'T AMOUNT TO MUCH MORE THAN THAT 
ON THROUGH THE MORNING IT IS SLOW PROGRESS 
BUT SLOWLY THIS RAIN PUSHES EAST 
IT WON'T BE A CONCERN FOR MUCH OF THE EAST MIDLANDS EAST ANGLIA 
AND THE SOUTH EAST WHERE TEMPERATURES COULD PUSH TWENTY DEGREES 
THERE WILL BE HINTS OF SUNSHINE ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE PENNINES 
AS WE MOVE FURTHER NORTH 
THE RAIN WILL TAKE AWAY THE BRIGHT START IN THE NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND 
SOME OF IT WILL COME DOWN THE FORTH AND CLYDE VALLEYS 
AFTER THE WET START IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
SOMETHING DRIER BY THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON 
WITH THESE BREEZES FROM THE SOUTH IT WILL BE MILD FOR THE TIME OF YEAR 
DESPITE THE LACK OF SUNSHINE IN SOME WESTERN AREAS 
ACROSS WALES WE COULD SEE FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN DEGREES 
AND A SIMILAR PROSPECT IN THE SOUTH WEST 
LET ME TAKE YOU INTO SUNDAY AND YOU SEE THE PROGRESS OF THESE FRONTS 
OVER INTO THE EASTERN BRITISH ISLES IS QUITE SLOW 
BUT THE CLOUD WILL KEEP THINGS MILD OVERNIGHT 
AS WE MOVE INTO SUNDAY THE FRONT WILL BRING RAIN TO THE EAST 
ON WHAT WILL BE A CLOUDY DAY FOR MANY SPOTS 
ON MONDAY A BIT OF BRIGHTNESS TO THE WEST OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
THAT'S THE EVEN HANDED BALANCE ABOUT THINGS 
THE LAST OF THE RAIN LURKING TOWARDS THE EAST OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
AND YOU DO NOTICE WITH THE WIND FROM THE SOUTH OR SOUTH EAST 
TEMPERATURES WILL STAY ABOVE THE SEASONAL AVERAGE 
THAT'S THE WAY THINGS ARE LOOKING MORE DETAILS ON THE WEB 
FROM ME GOODNIGHT 
DOCTOR IT'S MARTHA I'M BRINGING YOU BACK TO EARTH 
TEN JUST LIKE OLD TIMES NINE 
WHAT ARE YOU SEARCHING FOR EIGHT SONTARANS LAUNCHING IN SEVEN 
WHAT DO I DO SIX DO NOT ENGAGE IN BATTLE FIVE FIGHT BACK 
FOUR THIS IS OUR CHANCE THREE 
I TOLD YOU NOT TO LAUNCH TWO GLORIOUS WARFARE ONE 
GET THEM OUT OF THERE
