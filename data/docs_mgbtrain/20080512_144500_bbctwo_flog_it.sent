IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE A CRATER ON MARS WAS NAMED AFTER THIS PLACE 
THAT IS THIRTY FIVE MILLION MILES AWAY IN THAT DIRECTION 
CORBY'S HISTORY IS TIED UP WITH ITS INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE 
THE TOWN ONCE BOASTED A MASSIVE STEEL WORKS EMPLOYING MANY THOUSANDS 
BUT TODAY ALL THE TALK IS OF REGENERATION 
OUR TWO CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY ARE DAVID BARBY AND JETHRO MARLES 
AND OUR LOCATION HERE ON PLANET EARTH TODAY IS THE WILLOWS ARTS COMPLEX 
IT'S EVALUATION DAY BUT NOT AS WE KNOW IT 
FIRST UP DAVID'S HAVING A CLOSE ENCOUNTER 
WITH A TILE PORTRAIT OF WHIG PRIME MINISTER WILLIAM GLADSTONE 
MARY ARE YOU A LIBERAL SUPPORTER NO DEFINITELY NOT I'M A TRUE BLUE 
OH GOOD SO AM I WHY HAVE YOU GOT THIS IN YOUR HOUSE THEN 
ABOUT NINETEEN SIXTY AN AUNT DIED SHE WAS A GREAT AUNT 
WE HAD TO CLEAR HER HOUSE OUT 
I FOUND HIM UNDER THE STAIRS 
I DECIDED I WOULD TAKE HIM HOME BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOK OF HIM 
I THOUGHT HE WAS SUCH A GRUMPY LOOKING OLD MAN 
SO HE HUNG IN THE WOOD SHED FOR YEARS AND YEARS 
WITH HIS FACE TO THE WALL 
OH DEAR HE WASN'T SUCH A BAD OLD STICK WAS HE REALLY 
HE WAS VERY PHILANTHROPIC CERTAINLY TOWARDS THE LADIES OF THE NIGHT 
OH REALLY HE TRIED TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO GO ONTO A STRAIGHT ROAD OH 
THIS IS QUITE AN INTERESTING PIECE BECAUSE IT IS A TILE A CERAMIC PICTURE 
THE TECHNIQUE OF IT IS QUITE CLEVER 
THINK IN TERMS OF BLACK AND WHITE IN REVERSE 
YES SO THOSE AREAS WHICH ARE SLIGHTLY DARK HAVE A DEEPER 
GROOVE OR MOULDING IN THE ACTUAL CERAMIC MOULD 
WHEN THEY POURED GLAZE OVER IT IT WOULD RECEIVE MORE GLAZE SO APPEAR DARKER 
SO IT'S DONE IN REVERSE SOMETHING LIKE A NEGATIVE 
YES ABSOLUTELY BUT THE LIKENESS IS EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD AND IT WAS TAKEN FROM A PHOTOGRAPH 
ALL THE DETAILS ARE HERE 
BY A PERSON CALLING THEMSELVES MR. MENDELSSOHN 
WE'VE GOT IT DATED HERE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT 
AT AUCTION THE VALUE OF THIS IS PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF FORTY TO SIXTY 
YOU'RE JOKING 
DID YOU EXPECT MORE MARY NO HOW MUCH WOULD YOU HAVE PAID FOR IT 
NOTHING I'D HAVE GIVEN IT AWAY 
WELL THE GENTLEMAN'S GOT A VERY GOOD HISTORY 
FROM A POTTING POINT OF VIEW IT'S AN EXCELLENT EXPERIMENTAL PIECE OF WORK SO THIS IS QUITE GOOD 
THERE ARE SO MANY OF THESE PRODUCED TOWARDS THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY PEOPLE DO COLLECT THEM OH RIGHT 
SO LET'S HOPE WE'VE GOT SOMEONE WHO COLLECTS THESE PHOTOGRAPHIC TILES 
OH YOU DEAR OLD MAN YOU'RE NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL YOU CAN GIVE HIM A PAT ON THE HEAD 
ABBIE HI YOU'VE BROUGHT IN ANOTHER PRESENT FOR ME 
THAT BOX IS A BRACELET BOX OH IS IT 
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THE ORIGINAL 
SO IT'S NOT A BRACELET THAT'S INSIDE NO 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE 
WE HAVE A MOONSTONE NECKLACE 
AND A PAIR 
OF EARRINGS 
DO YOU LIKE MOONSTONES I LOVE MOONSTONES 
THESE ARE PART OF YOUR LARGE EXTENSIVE COLLECTION NO DOUBT 
I HAVE A FEW DO YOU WHAT IS IT YOU LIKE ABOUT MOONSTONES SO MUCH 
I LOVE THE WAY THE LIGHT REFLECTS THROUGH THEM AND THE COLOURS THEY COME IN ALL SORTS OF COLOURS 
PEOPLE THINK MOONSTONE IS JUST A MILKY WHITISH STONE 
BUT THEY HAVE MILKY WHITE GOING RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH TO ALMOST RAINBOW BLUES YEAH 
HAVE YOU GOT ANY OF THOSE UNFORTUNATELY NOT THESE ARE QUITE BLUE 
A LOT OF THESE ARE QUITE BLUE HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THIS HOW DID YOU COME BY IT 
I'VE HAD THEM FOR A YEAR AND A HALF 
I BOUGHT THEM FROM A CHARITY SHOP 
BECAUSE I LOVED THE MOONSTONES HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THEM 
TWENTY I PAID FOR THEM 
TWENTY 
YOU'D GET TWENTY FOR ONE EARRING 
REALLY YOU WOULD 
A LOT OF THESE NECKLACES WERE BROUGHT BACK FROM INDIA 
COMING BACK FROM THE WARS OVER THERE 
IT WAS QUITE A POPULAR GIFT TO BRING BACK OVER 
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF IT DOESN'T GO BACK THAT FAR IN AGE 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A NECKLACE THAT MIGHT BE ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
SO CONDITION WISE WE'VE UNFORTUNATELY GOT A CHIP 
ON THE TOP END OF THE LARGE PEAR SHAPE YEAH 
BUT THE TWO LARGER MOONSTONE DROPS OF THE EARRINGS ARE IN GOOD ORDER 
SO I THINK BEARING IN MIND THE SETTINGS ARE QUITE THIN 
I WOULD SAY YOUR TWENTY IS GOING TO BE TURNED INTO 
SOMETHING BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY REALLY HOW DOES THAT SOUND 
THAT SOUNDS FAB YEAH YEAH SHALL WE PUT THEM IN THE AUCTION 
YES DEFINITELY LOVELY LET'S HOPE THEY BRING SUCCESS FOR YOU 
HOPEFULLY 
SO ARE YOU THE CRICKET FAN 
NO IT WAS MY DAD'S IT BELONGED TO HIM 
HE WON IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AT OUR LOCAL CRICKET CLUB RIGHT 
I GUESS LOCAL MEANING NORTHANTS BECAUSE IT'S SIGNED BY THE NORTHANTS SQUAD HERE AS OPPOSED TO YORKSHIRE 
YOU'VE GOT TO SUPPORT THE LOCALS EXACTLY IT IS SIGNED BY THE WHOLE SQUAD IN EIGHTY SEVEN 
IT'S IN FANTASTIC CONDITION IS THIS SOMETHING YOU'RE PREPARED TO SELL 
NOT REALLY WE'RE KEEPING IT IN OUR FAMILY DEFINITELY 
THE VALUE OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN AUCTION IS GOING TO REALISE 
AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY HOPEFULLY TWO HUNDRED IF YOU GET IT IN THE RIGHT SPORTING SALE 
SO HANG ON TO IT O. K. BRILLIANT THANK YOU 
SO WHERE DOES IT COME FROM FROM MY GRANDMOTHER YOUR GRANDMOTHER 
YEAH ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE ON YOUR MOTHER'S SIDE O. K. 
IS THERE ANY HISTORY BEHIND THIS 
AS FAR AS WE KNOW 
THE RUMOUR GOES IT WAS THE ONLY TOY MY GRANDMOTHER EVER HAD REALLY 
DID SHE COME FROM A WEALTHY FAMILY 
NO BECAUSE THIS SORT OF TOY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY TO SEVENTY WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE AN EXPENSIVE OBJECT 
RIGHT 
SO EITHER IT WAS GIVEN TO HER AS A SECOND HAND TOY 
BUT IT'S STILL VALUABLE TODAY AS MUCH AS IT WAS VALUABLE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
WHAT IS INTERESTING THIS IS A BOY DOLL 
THIS PLEATED SKIRT HERE AND THIS WONDERFUL 
SAILOR'S OUTFIT AT THE BACK IS COMPLETELY ORIGINAL 
AND THIS ADDS SO MUCH VALUE TO AN OBJECT LIKE THIS 
THESE ARE GLASS EYES THEY ARE CALLED MILLIFLORE SMALL FLOWERS BEAUTIFULLY PRODUCED 
THE ACTUAL HEAD IS A COMPOSITION IT'S NOT PORCELAIN 
IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY YOU CAN SEE ON THE NOSE AND MOUTH 
THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEAR 
I WOULD SAY THIS DOLL IS POSSIBLY GERMAN ORIGIN 
WHAT I FIND INTRIGUING IS THE LITTLE LAD'S HAIRCUT 
IT'S QUITE KNOBBLY AND BLOND ISN'T IT 
I THINK THIS IS 
LAMB'S FUR 
IF YOU CAN SEE HERE YOU CAN SEE THE PELT AT THE VERY BACK 
IT GIVES IT SUCH AN ODD APPEARANCE 
IT'S WEIRD YEAH HAVE YOU GOT PERMISSION TO SELL IT WE HAVE YES YOU HAVE 
IT'S BEEN WRAPPED UP IN A CLOTH FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS 
BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE PUT IT OUT MY CHILDREN THINK THE EYES FOLLOW THEM AROUND THE ROOM 
THEY'RE RATHER LIKE A PORTRAIT WHEN YOU GO TO A STATELY HOME 
YOU SAY I DON'T LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE EYES FOLLOW YOU 
EXACTLY THE SAME WITH THIS DOLL EXACTLY THE SAME FEELING WEIRD 
FORTY TO FIFTY QUID FORTY TO FIFTY 
I THINK YOU COULD PROBABLY DOUBLE IT IF NOT TREBLE IT 
SOUNDS NICE I'M LOOKING AT ROUNDABOUT NINETY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THAT SORT OF PRICE RANGE 
I THINK THE AUCTIONEER WILL PUT A RESERVE OF ABOUT EIGHTY ON IT FINE YEP 
I HOPE IT'S GOING TO ACHIEVE MORE THAN THAT THAT'S LOVELY 
NATALIE AND MATTHEW WHAT A LOT OF TOY SOLDIERS YOU'VE BROUGHT ALONG 
THEY'RE ALL LEAD SOLDIERS AREN'T THEY YES 
YOU'VE GOT PRETTY MUCH SOMETHING OF EVERYTHING HERE YOU GOT KNIGHTS IN ARMOUR 
ARTILLERY 
SO WHERE HAVE THESE COME FROM 
MY MOTHER WAS LEFT THEM APPROXIMATELY TWENTY YEARS AGO 
WITH AN ASSORTMENT OF NUMEROUS THINGS WHICH WERE AT THIS PROPERTY 
RIGHT SO A FRIEND OF YOUR MOTHER'S 
HE DIED LEFT HER LOTS OF THINGS AMONGST WHICH WERE THESE SOLDIERS 
I THINK THESE WERE PROBABLY ONE OF HIS PRIDE AND JOY DON'T YOU 
THE TIME IT TOOK TO PAINT THEM I SHOULD BELIEVE SO EXACTLY 
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE VERY OLD MAYBE THIRTY YEARS IS PROBABLY HOW OLD SOME OF THEM ARE 
THAT WOULD SOUND ABOUT RIGHT SOME OF THEM ARE OLDER 
YOU HAVE DIFFERENT SIZES THE NAPOLEONIC ONES ARE QUITE SMALL 
AND THEY'RE THE ONES YOU WOULD USE IN GAMING WITH DICE 
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TOLD 
I'VE PULLED OUT A COUPLE HERE WHICH ARE QUITE NICE 
YOU'VE GOT SOME ROMAN CHARIOTEERS HE HAS MOUNTED THEM UP QUITE WELL 
YOU'VE GOT A GRASSY BASE ON EACH OF THEM 
I WOULDN'T SAY THEY'RE FINELY PAINTED BUT THERE'S A LOT HERE 
THEN YOU'VE GOT THESE CROSSBOW MEN 
FROM POSSIBLY THE MIDDLE AGES 
THEN YOU'VE GOT THESE JOUSTING KNIGHTS ON HORSEBACK 
I THINK WITH THE NAPOLEONIC ONES 
THE DETAIL ON THIS IS ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD 
IT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN ON THE LARGER MODELS 
SO YOU'VE GOT QUITE AN ASSORTMENT HERE BUT WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT 
WE'VE GOT SOME GAMING MATS AND GREENERY 
THE GAMING BOOKS THAT GO WITH THEM THERE'S SOME DICE AND THINGS IN THERE 
BASICALLY IT'S EVERYTHING SO THAT YOU CAN GO TO WAR 
WELL FORTUNATELY NO ONE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO GET KILLED IN ANY WARS YOU HAVE WITH IT 
I'M GUESSING A LITTLE BIT AS TO THE AMOUNT THEY'RE GOING TO BRING 
WHEN THEY SELL WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE MONEY 
WELL WE'RE ACTUALLY QUITE OVERDUE FOR OUR WEDDING 
YOUR OVERDUE FOR YOUR WEDDING YEAH 
IT WAS MEANT TO BE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S BASICALLY NEXT YEAR OR NOT AT ALL 
ALL RIGHT SO HOW MUCH HAS THIS GOT TO MAKE FOR YOU TO POP THE QUESTION 
I'VE POPPED THE QUESTION I JUST NEED TO GET MOVING AND GET IT DONE 
AS IT WERE THERE'S BEEN VARIOUS THINGS HOLDING US UP 
WE NEED TO DO IT AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT THAT'S A CELEBRATION TO LOOK FORWARD TO 
LET'S HOPE WE CAN GET A GOOD PRICE FOR THIS 
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE REALISTIC 
ABSOLUTELY YEAH IF YOU WANT TO SELL THEM WE'D PROTECT THEM WITH A RESERVE THAT 
I HOPE WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE EASILY A RESERVE OF ONE HUNDRED 
MARVELLOUS THAT'S MORE THAN WHAT I THOUGHT 
BRILLIANT AND AN ESTIMATE OF IT COULD BE ANYTHING ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED 
GREAT IF WE GIVE THAT AS A VERY WIDE ESTIMATE 
LOVELY LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN GET

WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE TWO HUNDRED 
I HAVE AN EMBROIDERED SILK PICTURE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE REFRAMED SO THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING ON 
AND I'VE JUST MOVED SO THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER THINGS I CAN SPEND IT ON 
ABBIE THANK YOU FOR COMING IN AND BRIGHTENING UP THE PLACE LOOKING SO GORGEOUS 
JETHRO WHAT A GREAT RESULT AND I LOOK GORGEOUS TOO YOU DO YOU ALWAYS LOOKS SUPERB 
I'VE BEEN TOLD THERE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY BUILDING 
NEAR MARKET HARBOROUGH THAT'S NOT ALL WHAT IT SEEMS 
IT SOUNDS LIKE A PUZZLE SO WHILE I'M IN THE AREA I'M GOING TO TAKE A LOOK 
THIS IS RUSHDEN HALL 
BUILT ROUND ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT IT WAS THE SOURCE OF SOME FAMOUS ARTISTIC INSPIRATION 
IN VICTORIAN TIMES CHARLES DICKENS VISITED HERE AND CONCEIVED 
THE IDEA OF HAVISHAM HALL FOR HIS NOVEL GREAT EXPECTATIONS 
IT'S NOT THE HOUSE I HAVE COME TO SEE BUT SOMETHING MORE INTRIGUING 
IT'S THE GROUNDS THAT HOUSE AN EXTRAORDINARY ARCHITECTURAL PUZZLE 
SO LET ME SHOW YOU WHY 
IT HAS ONE 
IT HAS TWO 
AND HERE'S THE THIRD WHICH BRINGS ME BACK TO THE BEGINNING WHERE I STARTED FROM 
SO THE BUILDING IS AN EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE 
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY YOU CAN SEE IT'S GOT THREE FLOORS 
AND ON EACH FLOOR THERE'S THREE WINDOWS 
ABOVE THAT THERE'S THREE GABLE ENDS 
RIGHT AT THE VERY TOP THERE'S EVEN A CHIMNEY PIECE WHICH IS TRIANGULAR 
AND HERE TO HELP ME DECIPHER IT ALL 
IS BERYL SPEARMAN AN EXPERT WITH ENGLISH HERITAGE 
HELLO WOW WHAT AN AMAZING AND ORNATE BUILDING 
IT'S A PRETTY PIECE OF ARCHITECTURE WHAT WAS IT USED FOR 
IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE WARRENER'S LODGE 
THE WARRENER WAS THE CHAP WHO LOOKS AFTER THE RABBITS 
SO THIS WAS BUILT PURELY FOR A GAMEKEEPER IT'S POSSIBLY GOT OTHER MEANING TO IT 
IT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THOMAS TRESHAM IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY THREE AND WHO WAS HE 
HE WAS A CATHOLIC IN PROTESTANT ELIZABETHAN ENGLAND YES 
HE WAS IN A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR HIS FAITH 
HE SPENT A LONG TIME IN PRISON AND WHILST HE WAS IN PRISON HE PLANNED THIS BUILDING 
HE WANTED IT TO BE A STATEMENT OF HIS FAITH 
IT'S A SHRINE ISN'T IT REALLY 
WHY THE THREES 
EVERYTHING IS IN THREE 
THE THREES REFERRED TO THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OF THE HOLY TRINITY 
GOD THE FATHER GOD THE SON GOD THE HOLY SPIRIT 
IF WE WERE ELIZABETHAN I'M SURE WE'D BE ABLE TO READ THIS BUILDING 
MUCH MORE EASILY THAN WE CAN TODAY BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN USED TO BEING TOLD THINGS IN PICTURES 
YES AND ALSO CRYPTIC MESSAGES AND SYMBOLISM 
THE ELIZABETHANS LOVED A PUZZLE AND A PUN SHALL WE GO AND DECIPHER IT 
COME AND HAVE A LOOK 
RIGHT LET'S START AT THE VERY TOP ON THOSE THREE GABLE ENDS 
O. K. NOW THE BIRD 
THAT IS THE PELICAN IN HER PIETY 
AND SHE IS SHOWN FEEDING HER YOUNG WITH HER OWN BLOOD 
SO IT WAS A COMMON IMAGE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY TO REPRESENT JESUS 
CARING FOR HIS PEOPLE 
AND THERE'S WRITING ALL AROUND ON THE THREE SIDES 
YES THERE'S A LATIN INSCRIPTION AND A BIBLE QUOTATION ON EACH SIDE 
ON THIS SIDE IT SAYS WHO SHALL SEPARATE US FROM THE LOVE OF CHRIST 
AND THE INSCRIPTION HAPPENS TO BE THIRTY THREE LETTERS LONG 
WHICH SOME PEOPLE SAY WAS THE AGE OF CHRIST WHEN HE WAS CRUCIFIED THAT'S RIGHT 
MY WORD IT REALLY IS DAN BROWN SORT OF D. A. VINCI CODE STUFF GOING ON 
WOULDN'T HE LOVE IT 
AND A LOT OF THE PUZZLES HAVE NOT BEEN INTERPRETED YET 
SO PERHAPS SOMEBODY COMING ALONG WILL BE ABLE TO FIND SOME ANSWERS 
EXACTLY BEFORE WE GO INSIDE LET'S JUST HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT WHAT'S WRITTEN ABOVE THE DOOR THERE 
BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO GET COMPLICATED IT IS YES 
ABOVE THE DOOR IT SAYS TRES TESTIMONIUM DANT WHICH MEANS THERE ARE THREE THAT BEAR WITNESS 
O. K. AND THE FOUR FIVES 
THOSE FOUR FIVES COULD BE A CRYPTOGRAM LEADING US TO THE WORDS 
JESUS MARIA SANCTUS MUNDI WHICH MEANS IN LATIN CHRIST THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD 
BUT THEY'VE ALL GOT FIVE LETTERS IN EACH WORD 
YES IT COULD ALSO BE A NUMBER PUZZLE 
THAT LEADS US TO THE YEAR THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO B. C. 
WHICH IS A YEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THE WORLD WAS CREATED YES 
FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE YEARS LATER WE COME TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY THREE 
BANG THIS BUILDING YES 
GOSH LET'S GET INSIDE AND HAVE A LOOK 
HERE WE ARE BERYL IN THE WARM AND THE DRY 
WOW IT'S LIKE A LITTLE MINI CASTLE 
YES IT IS COMPARED TO THE OUTSIDE IT IS SO SIMPLE IN HERE 
IT LOOKS VERY AUSTERE WAS THIS USED FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES 
DID THEY HAVE SECRET MASSES HERE 
THERE ARE NO RECORDS 
BUT AT THE TIME IT WAS VERY DODGY TO HOLD A CATHOLIC MASS 
IT WAS A GREAT RISK 
SO THOSE MASSES WERE HELD IN SECRET 
WELL I THINK THIS IS THE IDEAL PLACE 
IT LOOKS VERY ECCLESIASTICAL ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE SYMBOLISM AROUND ON THE WALLS 
AND IT'S NICELY TUCKED AWAY 
YES IT'S HIDDEN ISN'T IT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TRESHAMS 
THOMAS TRESHAM SPENT A LONG TIME IN PRISON 
HE WAS FINED A TOTAL OF NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND 
BACK THEN SO WHAT DOES THAT CORRELATE TO IN TODAY'S MONEY 
TODAY THAT WOULD BE FOUR MILLION 
GOSH HE WAS A WEALTHY MAN 
IT IS LIKE A RICH MAN'S FOLLY ISN'T IT 
IT'S NICELY ECCENTRIC 
TYPICALLY BRITISH YES BERYL THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME AROUND 
THOMAS TRESHAM WAS NO REBEL 
BUT HE WAS PERSECUTED FOR HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS 
BUT IT WAS HIS SON FRANCIS WHO SOUGHT REVENGE AND GAINED NOTORIETY 
HE WAS ONE OF THE THIRTEEN CONSPIRATORS WHO TOOK PART IN THE GUNPOWDER PLOT ON FIFTH NOVEMBER ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIVE 
PROTESTANT KING JAMES HAD HIM ARRESTED AND PUT IN THE TOWER 
AFTER HIS DEATH HIS HEAD WAS PUT ON A SPIKE 
AND PUT OVER THE TOWN GATE OF NORTHAMPTONSHIRE 
THE ROOM IS STILL FILLING UP AND THERE'S AN EXCITING ATMOSPHERE BOUNCING AROUND THE ROOM 
WE'VE SEEN ALL SORTS OF THINGS FROM FURNITURE TO PORCELAIN 
AND EVEN FOOTBALL MEMORABILIA 
THIS IS A WORLD CUP FOOTBALL SIGNED BY THE ENGLAND SQUAD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND IT BELONGS TO DAVE 
RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME TO GET STRAIGHT BACK TO THE TABLES TO SEE WHAT OUR EXPERTS HAVE FOUND 
DIANA YOU'RE BRINGING IN ANOTHER SHAGGY DOG STORY FOR ME TO CONSIDER 
IT'S AN OLD ENGLISH SHEEPDOG ISN'T IT IT IS INSTANTLY RECOGNISABLE OF COURSE 
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT IT 
NOT A LOT REALLY 
IT WAS GIVEN TO ME AS A GIFT BECAUSE I HAD AN OLD ENGLISH SHEEPDOG 
THE LADY WHO OWNED IT HAD A HARDWARE STORE 
AND SHE HAD THIS AS A PROMOTIONAL ITEM AND THOUGHT I MIGHT LIKE IT 
SO YOU'VE DONE A VERY GOOD SYNOPSIS OF WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT 
IT'S A PROMOTIONAL ITEM 
IT'S THE DULUX DOG WHICH WAS USED AS A WINDOW DISPLAY TO ADVERTISE THEIR PAINT 
HE'S NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB NO HE'S NOT 
NO HE'S NOT ADVERTISING ANYTHING AT ALL JUST BLACK PAINT 
YES UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS LIKE THAT WHEN I GOT IT 
IT'S BEEN OVER PAINTED SO WHAT WAS PROBABLY A LOVELY WHITE EMULSION TIN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
HAS BEEN PAINTED OVER BLACK SO ALL OF THE INSIGNIA OF DULUX HAS BEEN COVERED OVER 
YES NOW THIS PARTICULAR MODEL IS NOT A RARE MODEL 
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS PARTICULAR PAINT COMPANY COMMISSIONED BESWICK 
TO PRODUCE NUMBERS OF THESE AND THEY SENT THEM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO PROMOTE THEIR PAINTS 
LET'S TURN HIM UP AND HAVE A LOOK TO MAKE SURE THAT'S CORRECT 
THERE WE HAVE THE BEAUTIFUL BESWICK MARK UNDERNEATH 
AND HERE IS THIS LARGE HOLE 
WHICH IS ALL PART OF THE MOULDING OF WHEN THIS PIECE WAS MADE 
IT'S CALLED SLIP MOULDING RIGHT 
APART FROM THE PAINT JOB HE IS IN PRETTY GOOD ORDER 
I CAN'T SEE ANY CHIPS OR DAMAGES HIS NOSE IS THE OTHER THING TO LOOK FOR THAT'S IN GOOD ORDER 
AND I HAVE A FEELING LOOKING AT THIS BLACK PAINT ON THIS TIN I THINK SOMEBODY COULD RISK 
TAKING THAT OFF VERY CAREFULLY WITH THE RIGHT CHEMICAL SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THAT RISK 
YES 
IN REALLY GOOD CONDITION IT WOULD BE WORTH PERHAPS THREE TIMES 
THE SORT OF FIGURE THAT I'M GOING TO SAY TODAY 
BUT I THINK IF WE GIVE A COME AND GET ME ESTIMATE 
IT MIGHT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BID ON IT 
I THINK WITH THIS PAINT JOB 
I WOULD SAY THIS PARTICULAR FELLOW IS GOING TO MAKE TWO HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
THAT'S FINE YOU'D BE HAPPY WITH THAT VERY HAPPY 
LET'S PUT A RESERVE AT TWO HUNDRED SO IF IT DOESN'T MAKE THAT WE WON'T SELL IT THAT'S LOVELY 
ALL RIGHT LET'S PUT HIM IN THE SALE THAT'S WONDERFUL THANK YOU 
RACHEL YES YOU'RE NOT VERY KEEN ON HOUSEWORK ARE YOU NOT AT ALL 
THIS IS SO DIRTY WHERE'S IT BEEN 
FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS IT HAS BEEN IN THE BARN WHERE DID IT COME FROM ORIGINALLY 
ORIGINALLY IT BELONGED TO MY GRANDFATHER 
AND WHEN WE MOVED INTO THE FARM IT WAS ALWAYS THERE ON THE WALL 
AND WE KNEW IT WHEN WE WERE KIDS AND THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT 
HE MUST HAVE COME FROM SOME INTERESTING BACKGROUND 
BECAUSE THIS IS A QUALITY PRINT 
WHICH WOULD HAVE COST A LOT OF MONEY FIRST OF ALL AS A PRINT 
AND THEN TO HAVE IT IN THIS EXPENSIVE OAK FRAME 
FARMING COMMUNITY YES 
MIDDLE CLASS BUSINESS PROSPEROUS MERCHANT FAMILY 
THAT'S THE SORT OF FAMILY THAT WOULD HAVE HOUSED THIS 
DOES THAT FIT INTO THE SORT OF WE WERE JUST FARMERS 
WELL THEY WERE WEALTHY FARMERS NINETEENTH CENTURY 
LIKE THEY ARE TODAY YES OH I DIDN'T SAY THAT 
WHAT I FIND INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IT'S BY QUEEN VICTORIA'S FAVOURITE ARTIST WILLIAM FRITH 
AND THERE WE HAVE HIS NAME RIGHT AT THE VERY BOTTOM 
THIS IS AN ENGRAVING IT WAS DONE BY A GENTLEMAN CALLED SIMMONS 
AND HIS NAME IS AT THE FAR END JUST BY YOU 
I FIND THIS REMARKABLE BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST LIKE A PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATE 
COMMEMORATING THE MARRIAGE OF THE PRINCE OF WALES 
LATER EDWARD THE SEVENTH AND PRINCESS ALEXANDRA OF DENMARK 
IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AND FRITH WAS SO GOOD AT THIS 
ALL THE FEATURES ARE DRAWN INDIVIDUALLY 
THERE'S NO SINGLE FEATURE WHICH IS REPLICATED 
MY ONLY BONE OF CONTENTION IS THEY ALL LOOK SO MISERABLE 
AND THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN A HAPPY DAY 
PROBABLY THEY WERE EMULATING QUEEN VICTORIA WHO IS THERE 
I CAN UNDERSTAND IF IT'S BEEN IN STORE THAT YOU WANT TO SELL IT 
DOES IT NOT INTEREST YOU TO KEEP THIS BECAUSE OF ITS HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE NO NOT REALLY 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR SO LONG AND NOBODY TOOK ANY NOTICE OF IT 
SO IT'S ONE OF THESE OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND 
ABSOLUTELY O. K. 
NOW CONDITION IS IMPORTANT 
THE FRAME UNFORTUNATELY IS IN A VERY POOR STATE 
WE'VE GOT WARPING AT THE TOP HERE AND THIS SECTION WHICH IS HANGING AWAY 
LOOKING AT THE PRINT ITSELF 
YOU'VE GOT STAINS ALL THE WAY ROUND WHICH ARE DAMP STAINS YES 
BUT IT DOES NOT ENCROACH ONTO THE MAIN SUBJECT 
THERE'S NO TEARS NO OTHER DAMAGE TO IT APART FROM THE STAINING 
AND I THINK IT IS A REMARKABLE RECORD 
NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK AS REGARDS PRICE ANY IDEAS 
TWENTY QUID 
HOPEFULLY A LITTLE MORE BUT I CAN'T SEE IT MAKING A GREAT DEAL TO BE HONEST BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE 
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE LUCKY AND BUY IT AT A CAR BOOT SALE FOR THAT 
AT AUCTION I WOULD EXPECT A MORE DISCERNING CLIENTELE 
AND WE SHOULD GET ROUND ABOUT SIXTY TO EIGHTY FOR IT 
IN BETTER CONDITION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED 
LET'S GO FOR IT 
LET'S GO FOR IT 
JANE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING MY DAY 
FOR MAKING FLOG IT HISTORY OH GOSH 
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST EXQUISITE THINGS I HAVE EVER SEEN 
ON FLOG IT AND HAD THE PLEASURE OF TOUCHING 
I'M SO PLEASED YOU PICKED ON ME TO TALK ABOUT IT WELL I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU 
WHENEVER I'VE WATCHED FLOG IT I KNEW YOU WOULD LOVE THIS 
THIS IS THE POINT IN ME BRINGING IT TO YOU I KNEW YOU'D LOVE IT 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL IT 
WELL THE THING IS OBVIOUSLY IT'S GETTING TOWARDS THE END OF MY LIFE 
DON'T BE SO PESSIMISTIC 
AND MY CHILDREN IT'S NOT THEIR SCENE REALLY 
AND I WANT IT TO BE APPRECIATED AND THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT YOU'D HANDLE IT FOR ME AND ENJOY SEEING IT 
WHEN I TOUCH THIS IT TOUCHES YOUR SOUL 
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS RIGHT 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PERIOD PIECE HOW DID YOU COME BY THIS 
IT WAS MY FATHER AND MOTHER'S IN THEIR HOUSE AND OF COURSE 
IT GRADUALLY GOT HANDED DOWN TO ME 
I WAS THE VERY YOUNGEST 
AND I'VE LOOKED AFTER IT EVER SINCE 
DO YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT OR ITS HISTORY NO I'M AFRAID I DON'T 
WELL YOU KNOW THIS IS A PIECE FROM THE HIGH REGENCY PERIOD 
AND IT REALLY DATES ROUND ABOUT THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTIES THIRTIES 
IT IS A TEA CADDY ON A LITTLE TABLE AS SUCH THERE WAS A NAME FOR THIS 
IT'S CALLED A TEA POY A TEA POY 
YEAH LARGE CADDIES WHICH WOULD BE KEPT IN THE DRAWING ROOMS 
UNDER LOCK AND KEY BECAUSE TEA WAS VERY VALUABLE QUITE EXPENSIVE 
BUT IT DOES STAND ALONE AS A CADDY 
YOU ALMOST FEEL LIKE YOU CAN ACTUALLY LIFT THIS TEA CADDY AWAY FROM THE LITTLE TABLE DON'T YOU 
YOU DO REALLY THIS WOULD HAVE COST A LOT OF MONEY IN ITS DAY LET'S OPEN IT UP 
LET'S SEE WHAT THE INTERIOR IS LIKE LOOK AT THAT IT'S JUST TO DIE FOR 
IT REALLY IS 
AS I SUSPECTED ON THE LARGER ONES YOU HAVE TWO SECTIONS 
ONE SECTION HERE WHICH IS BEAUTIFULLY FINISHED 
LINED TO KEEP THE TEA FRESH 
CONDITION IS SUPER 
I DON'T THINK THIS WAS EVER USED IN ITS DAY 
LOOK AT THAT THAT'S LOVELY 
THAT GEORGE THE THIRD BRIGHT PETROL BLUE PAPER LINING WHICH WAS VERY FASHIONABLE THEN 
WAS IT YES THIS IS A MIXING BOWL 
YES IT'S CUT GLASS THAT'S TO MIX THE TWO BLENDS TOGETHER 
PUT THE TEA IN AND MIX IT YEAH IT'S ALL BEAUTIFULLY STRING INLAID 
IT'S GOT EBONY AND SATINWOOD 
IT'S AMBOYNA WHICH IS A TROPICAL HARDWOOD 
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THAT AMBOYNA 
BUT IT'S GOT THIS WHAT WE CALL IN THE TRADE A PLUM PUDDING LOOK 
IT'S LIKE FOSSILISED MARBLE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN CUT THROUGH THE GRAIN WHERE THE BURR WAS ON THE WOOD 
IT'S VERY AMBIGUOUS AND DECORATIVE AND THEY CALL THAT PLUM PUDDING 
ALL THAT REALLY ADDS TO THE VALUE 
BECAUSE THE CONDITION IS SUPERB 
O. K. VALUE VALUE 
NO IDEA I HAVE NO IDEA 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH 
ONE THOUSAND IS THAT BEING TOO NO 
I THINK ONE THOUSAND IS SPOT ON FOR THIS 
IF I WALKED PAST AN ANTIQUE SHOP AND SAW IT IN THE WINDOW FOR ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED I WOULD MAKE AN OFFER OF ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED 
WOULD YOU YES SO FOR AUCTION PURPOSES I THINK WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT IN 
AT EIGHT HUNDRED TO TWELVE HUNDRED O. K. 
YES WE'LL PUT A FIXED RESERVE OF EIGHT HUNDRED YES IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU BUT I THINK THIS WILL FLY AWAY 
SHALL WE FLOG IT WE'LL FLOG IT PAUL WE'LL FLOG IT PAUL AND I'M GLAD YOU LOVE IT SO MUCH 
I COULD ALMOST TAKE IT HOME 
SO BACK TO THE AUCTION WHERE WE'VE GOT A BESWICK FIGURE OF THE FAMOUS

IT'S HAD A MAKE OVER CONSIDERING IT'S A DULUX PAINT DOG 
HOPEFULLY IT WILL MAKE THAT MONEY 
WE'VE SEEN THEM DO THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED IN GOOD CONDITION 
SO THE PRESSURE IS ON JETHRO 
I THINK THE ESTIMATE IS ABOUT RIGHT
