OLD WHO DISAPPEARED FROM DONCASTER 
SEVEN MONTHS AGO AND WAS CAUGHT ON 
C. C. T. V. AT KING'S CROSS WE'LL KEEP

MORNING HIS FAMILY REPORT HIM 
MISSING THE POLICE LAUNCH A 
NATIONWIDE SEARCH FOR HIM AND HIS 
CAR STEVE HAS BEEN GONE FOR THREE 
DAYS WHERE THERE IS A CALL FROM 
SCOTLAND YARD FROM SCOTLAND 
WE FIRST CAME ACROSS THE VEHICLE 
WHEN IT WAS REPORTED ABANDONED TO 
US AROUND TWENTY THIRD JANUARY IT WAS 
MEMBERS OF THE SCOTTISH NATURAL 
HERITAGE THAT WORK IN THIS AREA 
THAT FIRST REPORTED THE CAR TO US 
HIS FORD FOCUS IS FOUND IN THE 
SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS IT IS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES 
FROM HIS HOME IN YORKSHIRE BUT 
THERE IS NO SIGN OF STEVE 
THE CAR 
WAS BASICALLY JUST BEYOND WHERE 
THE POLICE CAR WAS THIS WAS THE 
IMMEDIATE AREA AROUND HERE WHICH 
WE CONDUCTED A SEARCH INITIALLY BE 
POLICE DOGS IT'S VERY VERY THICK 
INITIALLY WE KEPT TO QUITE A SMALL 
RADIUS AROUND THE VEHICLE LOOKING 
FOR ANY SIGNS OF STEPHEN 
DOZENS OF VOLUNTEERS FROM THE 
CAIRNGORM MOUNTAIN RESCUE TEAM 
EXTEND THE SEARCH BEYOND THE FOREST 
WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION 
TO GO ON BECAUSE IN THIS INSTANCE 
THE POLICE DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA IF 
THE GUY WAS GOING FOR A WALK INTO 
THE MOUNTAINS OR INDEED JUST OUT 
FOR A DRIVE AND HAD BROKEN DOWN SO 
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION 
THAT WE COULD USE TO ACTUALLY START 
THE SEARCH 
R. A. F. HELICOPTERS ARE CALLED OUT 
FOR TWO DAYS SEARCH AND RESCUE 
TEAMS COVER HUNDREDS OF MILES ON 
FOOTS FOOTS THEY CLEARED THE MOUNTAINSIDE ABOVE 
THE FOREST AND THEN WE CHECKED THE 
BASE OF ALL THE CRAGGS BUT THERE 
WAS NO SIGN 
STEVE'S MEDICAL 
CONDITION MEANS HE CAPTAIN' WALK 
FAR SO ON DAY THREE THE 
EMERGENCY SERVICES START TO SEARCH 
THE NEARBY LOCH 
WE ACTUALLY TOOK OUT SOME KAYAKS 
AND CHECKED THE SHORELINE OF THE 
WATER TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY SIGN 
OF HIM IN THE WATER BUT THERE WAS 
NOTHING AT ALL 
ON DAY FOUR OF THE INVESTIGATION 
R. A. F. HELICOPTERS BRING IN 
SOPHISTICATED SONAR EQUIPMENT TO 
SEARCH THE BOTTOM OF THE LOCH 
SENSORS THAT CAN DETECT A 
SUBMERGED BODY ARE LOWERED INTO 
THE WATER BUT AFTER TWELVE HOURS OF 
PAIN STAKING WORK NOTHING IS FOUND 
IT IS NOW A WEEK SINCE STEPHEN 
DISAPPEARED FROM HOME AND EVERYONE 
SEARCHING FOR HIM IS MYSTIFIED 
I'VE BEEN DOING MOUNTAIN RESCUE FOR 
THIRTEEN YEARS AND I DON'T REMEMBER NOT 
FINDING SOMEONE BUT AFTER FOUR 
DAYS WE WERE EXHAUSTED AND WE 
COULDN'T COME UP WITH ANY OTHER 
IDEAS OF WHERE HE COULD BE IT WAS 
JUST LIKE THE GUY HAD COMPLETELY 
DISAPPEARED 
NO WITNESSES HAD COME DISAPPEARED FORWARD SAYING THEY HAD SEEN STEVE 
WITH HIS CAR HE WAS LAST SEEN AT 
HOME WHEN HE SPENT A NORMAL EVENING 
NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE 
SPEARED DISAPPEARED 
THERE ARE 
NO HINTS OF ANY PROBLEMS OR 
DEPRESSION AND NO PROBLEMS WITH 
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH CLAIRE IT 
SEEMED REALLY HAPPY 
IT'S ALL OUT 
OF CHARACTER BECAUSE HE USED TO 
TELL ME THINGS AND IF THERE WERE 
ANYTHING BOTHERING HIM HE USED TO 
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT SO WE JUST 
WANT SOME ANSWERS HE'LL COME BACK 
ONE DAY I'M SURE HE WILL 
I MISS HIM TEASING ME AND TELLING 
ME HOW TO WORK THE COMPUTER AND 
GOING FOR BEER WITH HIM ON A 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND GOING ACROSS 
TO PLAY CARDS 
I MISS THAT 
CHRIS YOU ARE STEVE AS BROTHER BUT 
YOU ARE ALSO AN OFFICER IN THE MET 
HOW HAS THAT CHANGED THE WAY YOU 
LOOK AT THIS CASE IT'S QUITE BECAUSE LOUBLLY 
DIFFICULT REALLY BECAUSE LOUBLLY I WORK ON A MURDER OBVIOUSLY A 
WORK ON A MURDER INVESTIGATION TEAM 
AND I KNOW WHAT INQUIRIES CAN AND 
CAPTAIN CAN'T BE DONE AND TO BE 
HONEST IT IS FRUSTRATING HAVING TO 
LET ANOTHER TEAM DO THEIR JOB YOU 
WANT TO GET INVOLVED BUT YOU CAN'T 
DO THAT 
IT IS HARD AND I KNOW I 
WAS AN OFFICER IN THE POLICE AND 
IT IS SO HARD NOT TO GET INVOLVED 
AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE A BACK STEP IT 
MUST BE DIFFICULT FOR YOU 
IT IS 
AND I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS ASKING ME 
IF I CAN FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON 
IN THE INVESTIGATION AND I'M TRYING 
TO BE A LIAISON BETWEEN THE TWO 
SPEAKING TO THE POLICE AND PASSING 
ON THE INFORMATION TO THE FACT 
THERE SEEMS TO BE NO REASON FOR HIS 
DISAPPEARANCE 
NO WE CAN'T DISAPPEARANCE UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY 
AND THREE A M. IN THE MORNING HE'S LEFT 
HIS HOUSE KEYS MONEY AND CREDIT 
CARDS AND ANY FORM OF 
IDENTIFICATION HAS BEEN LEFT AT 
HOME AND NOBODY HAS ANY IDEA WHY 
HE HAS GONE 
HOW ARE THE FAMILY
