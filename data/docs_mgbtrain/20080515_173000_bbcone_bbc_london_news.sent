ALSO TONIGHT SIX YEARS ON AND NO 
ANSWERS CALLS FOR JUSTICE FOR 
VICTIMS OF THE POTTER'S BAR RAIL 
CRASH 
AND IF CHELSEA WIN THE CRASH EUROPEAN CUP NEXT WEDNESDAY WHEN 
THEY RETURN TO LONDON THEY MIGHT 
NOT BE HAVING A VICTORY PARADE 
MOVE OVER BEANO AS THE FIRST COMIC 
IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS COMES TO THE CAPITAL 
GOOD EVENING THE METROPOLITAN 
POLICE COMMISSIONER HAS TOLD THIS 
PROGRAMME THAT PARENTS NEED TO PLAY 
THEIR PART IN TACKLING TEENAGE GUN 
AND KNIFE CRIME IT COMES DAYS 
AFTER B. B. C. LONDON REVEALED THAT SEVENTY 
PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE HAVE 
BEEN MURDERED IN LESS THAN EIGHTEEN 
MONTHS MAKING THE SITUATION FAR 
WORSE THAN FIRST THOUGHT SIR IAN 
WAS SPEAKING AS THE NEW STOP AND 
SEARCH CRACKDOWN ON WEAPONS 
CONTINUED TODAY I'M HERE IN 
SUFFOLK WHICH HAS ONE OF THE 
HIGHEST KNIFE CRIME RATES IN THE 
CAPITAL THE MET SAYS YOUTH MURDERS 
ARE A TOP PRIORITY SECOND ONLY TO 
TERRORISM I WAS TALKING TO THE 
COMMISSIONER ON THE FIRST INDEPTH 
MEETING ON THE ISSUE L. ASKED HIM 
WAS THERE A CRISIS HE DENIED THAT 
L. ASKED HIM WAS IT OUT OF CONTROL 
NO I DON'T THINK IT'S OUT OF 
CONTROL THIS IS CITY WITH EIGHT 
MILLION PEOPLE BUT IT HAS GOT TO 
BE KEPT IN CONTROL WE CAN'T BE IN 
A POSITION IN WHICH MURDER AFTER 
MURDER OCCURS WR WITH NO APPARENT 
LINKAGE SOMETIMES THERE ARE 
OCCASIONAL GANG LINKAGES BUT THIS 
IS RANDOM 
AREN'T YOU PLAYING TO 
THE GALLERY 
WE HAVE ENORMOUS 
COMMUNITY SUPPORT HERE WE HAVE 
PEOPLE FROM THE STOP AND SEARCH 
MONITORING GROUP WHO ARE REALLY 
SUPPORTIVE WITH THIS WE HAVE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
OF THE OFFICERS WE'LL USE THEM IN 
THIS METHOD TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE 
REALISE THEY CAN'T CARRY A KNIFE 
THE DEPUTY MAYOR OF LONDON WAS 
DESCRIBING LONDON AS BECOMING THE 
KNIFE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD THAT'S THAT'S A JUDGMENT I'VE NEVER HEARD PUT IN 
THAT FORM THERE ARE MANY CITIES 
WHERE KNIVES WOULD BE VERY COMMON 
OUR PROBLEMS ARE ALWAYS THAT THE 
KNIVES ARE IN THE KITCHEN DRAWER 
ONE OF THE PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT IF 
YOU ARE GOING TO REDUCE KNIFE CRIME 
YOU HAVE TO START AT HOME YOU HAVE 
TO ASK AS A PARENT WHAT PARENT 
ASK THE CHILDREN WHAT ARE YOU 
CARRYING 
STOP AND SEARCH ARE CARRYING CONTROVERSIAL THERE'S A FEELING 
THAT YOUNG BLACK MALES THAT THEY 
WILL BE TARGETED 
IT IS AN 
INTERESTING THING IN THE MACHINE 
BEHIND US IT IS ARBITRARY IT IS 
WHOEVER WALKS THROUGH IT BUT WE 
HAVE TO RECOGNISE IN TALKING TO THE 
BLACK COMMUNITY IN LONDON THAT THE 
VICTIMS OF THE STABBINGS AND 
SHOOTINGS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY 
FROM ONE COMMUNITY 
WE REVEALED 
THAT ALMOST SEVENTY YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN MURDERED IN LESS THAN A YEAR 
AND A HALF IS THAT A LAMENTABLE 
RECORD 
I WILL PUT IT IN ANOTHER RECORD WAY MURDER IN LONDON HAS BEEN 
COMING DOWN 
NOT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
WAIT THE PROPORTION OF YOUNG 
PEOPLE IN THAT HAS BEEN RISING 
THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING SOMETHING 
ABOUT IT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF 
YOUNG PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY FIVE IN THIS CITY 
EVERY SINGLE DEATH IS TOO MANY YOU 
CAN HAVE RANDOM PATTERNS OF IT WE 
HAVE HAD TWO OR THREE IN THE LAST 
DAYS WE HAVE HAD SIX WEEKS WITHOUT 
ANY WE HAVE TO FIND EVERY METHOD 
TO STOP THIS HAPPENING 
SO THE 
COMMISSIONER THERE INSISTING THAT 
THERE'S NO CRISIS AND CRIME IS 
FALLING IS THAT GOING TO REASSURE 
PEOPLE DO YOU THINK 
SOME PEOPLE 
DOUBT THAT STOP AND SEARCH WILL 
WORK AND OTHERS THINK WHAT YOU 
HAVE SEEN HERE THE ELEPHANT AND AMP 
CASTLE THE METAL DETECTING ARCHES 
ARE A GIMMICK L. ASKED THE 
COMMISSIONER IF HE FELT HIS JOB WAS 
ON THE LINE IF THE MURDERS DID NOT 
COME DOWN HE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT 
BURGLARIES AND CRIME HAVE FALL 
ALL FALLEN 
COULD A NEW CODE OF 
CONDUCT FOR RESTAURANTS FINALLY END 
THE CONFUSION OVER WHERE OUR TIPS 
END UP 
IN JUST SIX DAYS TIME CHELSEA COULD 
BECOME THE FIRST LONDON TEAM TO BE 
CROWNED CHAMPIONS OF EUROPE 
TONIGHT THE CLUB IS EMBROILED IN A 
ROW WITH THE LOCAL COUNCIL OVER A 
VICTORY PARADE IF THEY BEAT 
MANCHESTER UNITED NEXT WEDNESDAY 
THE BLUES HAVE BEEN TOLD THEY WON'T 
BE ALLOWED TO PARADE THE TROPHY 
THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CAPITAL 
THE FOLLOWING EVENING AN OBVIOUS 
QUESTION WHY 
TRAFFIC CHAOS 
COMMUTER HELL THAT'S BASICALLY IT 
CHELSEA IF THEY WERE TO WIN THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE NEXT WEDNESDAY 
THEY WOULD RETURN TO LONDON ON THE 
THURSDAY THEY COULD 
APOLOGISES FOR THE LOSS OF 
SUBTITLES SUBTITLES ALL THE FOREIGN STARS AT CHELSEA 
MOST 
THEY HAVE TO JOIN UP WITH THEIR 
BERISFORD COUNTRIES AS SOON AS THEY 
GET BACK FROM THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE 
THANK YOU THEY NEED WIN FIRST 
A MAN AND A WOMAN HAVE BEEN 
RELEASED ON BAIL AFTER THEY WERE 
QUESTIONED BY POLICE INVESTIGATING 
THE ALLEGED MISUSE OF GRANTS FROM 
THE LONDON DEVELOPMENT AGENCY 
ANOTHER MAN IS STILL BEING 
QUESTIONED AT AN ESSEX POLICE 
STATION POLICE ARE LOOKING INTO 
THE FUNDING GIVEN TO SIX BLACK 
COMMUNITY GROUPS THE THREE PEOPLE 
WERE ARRESTED OVER ALLEGATIONS OF 
OBTAINING PROPERTY BY DECEPTION 
POLICE SAY AN EXPLOSION WHICH 
KILLED MAN AND DESTROYED THREE 
HOUSES IN HULL LAST WEEK WAS 
PROBABLY NOT STARTED DELIBERATELY 
AND HAVE BROUGHT OUT THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS DUE TO 
PURPLE LIQUID IN HARROW 
DETECTIVES BELIEVE IT IS MORE 
LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN GAS EXPLOSION 
IF NEW EXHIBITION HAS OPENED AT 
THE SCIENCE MUSEUM ABOUT HOW TO 
TACKLE THE COST THE ENVIRONMENT OF 
AIR TRAVEL 
IT SHOWS WHAT SCIENTISTS AND 
ENGINEERS ARE DOING TO LESSEN THE 
IMPACT OF FLYING AND WHAT WE CAN 
ALL DO TO REDUCE OUR CARBON 
FOOTPRINT 
IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE 
AIRLINE INDUSTRY WILL NOT CONTINUE 
TO PROSPER AS PART OF THE MODERN 
WORLD THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE 
COULD REDUCE THE EMISSIONS BY AS 
MUCH AS FIFTY PER CENT IF PEOPLE TRAVEL AS 
MUCH THAT WOULD TWICE AS MUCH 
THAT WOULD LEAVE IT LEVEL WITH 
TODAY'S STANDARDS WE NEED TO DO 
MORE 
THE POTTER'S BAR CRASH THERE MORE STILL HAVEN'T BEEN AN INQUEST NOR 
HAS THERE BEEN AN INQUIRY 
SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS ARE USING THE 
ANNIVERSARY TO DEMAND THEIR ANSWERS 
FOR SIX YEARS PAT SMITH WAS TRYING 
TO FIND OUT WHO WAS IN BLAME FOR 
HER MOTHER'S DEATH AGNES QUINLIVAN 
WAS KILLED IN THE POTTER POTTER 
BAR RAIL CRASH SHE WAS WALKING 
BENEATH THE BRIDGE 
WE DON'T KNOW 
WHO IS ACCOUNTABLE L. DOUBT WE WILL 
EVER KNOW WE DO NEED ANSWERS L. 
FEEL WE HAVE BEEN BRUSHED UNDER THE 
CARPET I WANT TO SAY WE HAVE DONE 
BEST BY YOUING 
A NECESSARY WAS ONE 
OF SEVEN PEOPLE KILLED AND SEVENTY SIX 
INJURED IN THE DISASTER FAULTY 
POINTS CAUSED THE DERAILMENT 
INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL GOING ON 
INTO HOW IT HAPPENED AND WHO IF 
ANYONE WAS RESPONSIBLE NO INQUESTS 
HAVE BEEN HELD THE SIX YEAR DELAY 
HAVE INFURIATED RELATIVES 
I CAN'T 
BELIEVE AFTER SIX YEARS WE HAVE NOT 
HAD A PUBLIC INQUIRY SOMETHING 
WENT WRONG WE NEED TO FIND OUT 
WHAT WENT WRONG PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF 
SHOULD NOT JUST WAKE UP TO 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN NOT 
HAVE ANY DEGREE OF CLOSURE OR 
DISCUSSION 
M. P. JAMES CLAPPISON HAS DISCUSSION RAISED THE GROWING CALL FOR A 
PUBLIC INQUIRY IN THE COMMONS THE 
TRANSPORT DEPARTMENT SAYS IT 
UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATIONS CAUSED 
BY THE DELAY BUT IT SAYS A 
DECISION CAN'T BE MADE ON AN 
INQUIRY UNTIL INVESTIGATIONS HAVE 
BEEN COMPLETED INQUESTS WILL HAVE 
TO WAIT TOO THAT'S LITTLE COMFORT 
FOR GRIEVING RELATIVES WHO HAVE 
ALREADY WAITED SIX YEARS FOR SOME 
ANSWERS ANSWERS IN TONIGHT'S TOP STORY WE HEARD 
FROM THE MET 
IT IS FACING FROM REHEARSALS FOR IN 
NEW PLAY DENISE BLACK FORMERLY 
FROM CORONATION STREET PLAYS A 
MOTHER LOOKING FOR SOME WAY TO MAKE 
SENSE OF HER SON'S DEATH SHE CAN 
SCISSORS CONSIDERS SHE 
CONSIDERS GIVING IT THE MURDERER 
THE IDEA OF FORGIVENESS IS THAT IT 
IS MAYBE SOMETHING UNIQUE TO DO TO 
RESUME YOUR LIFE L. DON'T KNOW IF 
YOU CAN FORGIVE UNTIL YOU GET THERE 
BUT I WOULD HOPE I COULD ENGINEER 
MYSELF TOWARDS THAT WAY BECAUSE 
EVERYBODY IS A HUMAN BEING 
IT MAKES THE COMPASSION OF THE 
PARENTS ONE OF THE LATEST TEENAGERS 
TO DIED IN LONDON ALMOST MORE 
ASTOUNDING JIMMY MIZEN HAD JUST 
TURNED SIXTEEN WHEN HE WAS KILLED ON 
SATURDAY IN SOUTH EAST LONDON TWO 
DAYS LATER HIS MOTHER GAVE HER 
REACTION TO WHAT HAPPENED PEOPLE PEOPLE SAY WHY ARE YOU NOT ANGRY BUT HIS 
ANGER THAT KILLED MY SON 
A CHARITY 
INSPIRED THE THEME OF THE PLAY 
THEY UNDERSTAND WHY JIMMY MIZEN'S 
MOTHER CHOSE TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF 
ANGER 
I WAS SPIEFD SHE COULD SAY THAT SO 
QUICKLY I THINK THAT'S VERY 
UNUSUAL I'VE MET MANY PEOPLE AND 
THEY VERY OFTEN HAVE LOST CHILDREN 
OR LOVED ONES WHO DO COME TO THAT 
POINT BECAUSE REVENGE AND HATRED 
FIXES LIFE STORIES FOREVER IT 
LOCKS YOU INTO PAIN AND SUFFERING 
AND IN THE END YOU'RE ONLY HARMING 
YOURSELF 
MARINA CANTACUZINO YOURSELF SPEAKING THERE WE WOULD LIKE TO 
YOUR REACTION TO THIS COULD YOU 
FOR GIVE SOMEONE WHO ATTACKED YOU 
OR YOUR FAMILY OR V. HAS SOMEONE 
CLOSE TO YOU DONE IT IT WAS ONE OF 
THE FORMER MAYOR'S KEY ACHIEVEMENTS 
IN POWER A SUCCESSFUL OLYMPIC BID 
KEN LIVINGSTONE SAW IT AS A WAY TO 
CHANGE THE FACE OF EAST LONDON HIS 
SUCCESSOR BORIS JOHNSON SIGNALLED 
THAT TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ONE LESS ABOUT REGENERATION 
UNDER HIS WATCH BUT MORE ABOUT 
GETTING CHILDREN INTO SPORT WHAT 
IS THE NEW MAYOR'S VISION 
NOT QUITE A BORIS BECKER BUT 
DEFINITELY A BORIS THE NEW MAYOR 
WANTS THE OLYMPICS TO BE ABOUT 
GETTING KIDS INTO SPORT BUT HE 
CHOSE AN INTERESTING TENNIS PARTNER 
TO START HIS OLYMPIC BUSINESS TODAY 
LABOUR M. P. KATE HOEY HIS NEW SPORTS 
COMMISSIONER 
HER APPOINTMENT IS COMMISSIONER CONTROVERSIAL REMEMBER THIS IS THE 
POLITICIAN WHO BELIEVED THAT PARIS 
SHOULD GET THE OLYMPICS AND THAT 
LONDON SHOULD NOT EVEN BOTHER 
BIDDING BIDDING THE LOGO WAS ON SHOW BUT JOHNSON 
DID NOT TALK MUCH ABOUT THE 
OLYMPICS DURING THE ELECTION IT 
WAS LIVINGSTONE TERRITORY NOW WE 
ARE LEARNING A BIT MORE 
WE NEED TO 
MAKE SURE THE BENEFITS FROM THE 
OLYMPICS AND SPORTING ENTHUSIASM OF 
FELT RIGHT THE WAY ACROSS LONDON 
AND THAT IS WHY I AM PLEASED KATE 
WILL BE SPEARHEADED A BIG BOOM IN 
SPORTING PARTICIPATION 
TO GET THE 
MESSAGE ACROSS HE IS PREPARED TO 
IGNORE THOSE INFAMOUS PUBLIC 
RELATIONS GURUS 
I AM NOT LISTENING TO MY SPIN 
DOCTORS 
THIS SUMMER HIS BIGGEST DOCTORS JOB WAS TO PICK UP THE OLYMPIC FLAG 
AT THE BEIJING OLYMPICS IN FRONT OF 
BILLIONS BUT HIS FIRST OLYMPIC 
APPOINTMENT WON'T HAVE EVERYBODY 
JUMPING UP AND DOWN WITH GLEE 
DURING THE BID THEY CAUGHT KATE 
HOEY AND IRRITATION 
I AM SURE WE 
WILL BE ABLE TO WALK TO WORK VERY 
HARD TOGETHER BECAUSE I AM 
DETERMINED TO GET SPORT HIGHER UP 
THE PRIORITY LIST BOTH GOVERNMENT 
AND LONDON 
FOKINE LIVINGSTONE THE 
OLYMPICS WAS ABOUT REGENERATING 
EAST LONDON FOR KEN LIVINGSTONE 
BORIS JOHNSON WANTS IT TO BE ABOUT 
GETTING CHILDREN AT LIKE THIS TO 
TAKE UP SPORT BUT WITHOUT A 
SPECIFIC 
WILL BE HARD FOR 
THAT TO HAPPEN 
STAY WITH US COMING UP BIRD 
WATCHING URBAN STYLE I AM ON A 
TWITCHING TREASURE HUNT AT SOME TOP 
WILDLIFE DESTINATIONS FORCED OFF 
AND MEET ASHER GOOD DOG AND BAD 
DOG DOG YOU MAY NOT KNOW THEM YET BUT THEY 
ALONG WITH PHILIP PULLMAN ARE 
FEATURED IN THE FIRST CHILDREN'S 
COMICS FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS MORE 
LATER LATER WHEN YOU TIP A WAITER OR WAITRESS 
AT A RESTAURANT YOU MIGHT ASSUME 
IT IS AN ADDED BONUS ON TOP OF 
THEIR WAGE BUT A LOOPHOLE IN THE 
LAW ALLOWS SOME BUSINESSES TO USE 
THE MONEY TO MAKE UP BASIC PAY 
RESTAURANTS IN THE CAPITAL ARE 
BEING ENCOURAGED TO SIGN UP TO A 
CODE OF CONDUCT A PROMISING ALL 
TIPS WILL GO DIRECTLY TO STAFF 
MARC ASHDOWN WENT TO FIND OUT HOW 
MANY BOSSES WILL WILLING 
THE WHEN YOU HAVE HAD A GOOD MEAL 
AND GOOD SERVICE IT IS NICE TO 
LEAVE A TIP AND IT IS ALSO NICE TO 
KNOW IT WILL DEFINITELY GO TO THEM 
IF YOU USE CASH YOU CAN GENERALLY 
BE SURE THAT WILL FIND ITS WAY TO 
THE POCKET OF WHOEVER SERVE YOU OR 
A CENTRAL POT BUT IF YOU PAY WITH 
CREDIT CARD THAT BECOMES THE LEGAL 
PROPERTY OF THE RESTAURANT AND IT 
IS UP TO THEM WHAT THEY DO WITH IT 
RESTAURANTS LIKE THIS ITALIAN GIVE 
ALL THE MONEY TO THEIR STAFF ARE ON 
TOP OF THEIR BASIC WAGES BUT SOME 
USE CARD TIPS AND SERVICE CHARGES 
TO MAKE UP THE PAY PACKET 
ACCORDING TO THE UNION UNITE SOME 
BASIC RATE ENDS UP BEING BELOW A 
MINIMUM WAGE 
TECHNICALLY NOTHING 
THAT THE EMPLOYERS ARE DOING IS 
ILLEGAL AND WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS 
JUST BECAUSE IT IS NOT ILLEGAL 
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO DO IT IF 
YOU NEED TO BE HONEST WITH YOUR 
STAFF AND CUSTOMERS A WAGE SHOULD 
BE A WAITER AND A TIP SHOULD BE A 
TIP 
SO LONDON'S RESTAURANTS ARE TIP BEING ASKED TO SIGN UP TO THIS 
CHARTER SO CUSTOMERS KNOW WHERE 
THEIR MONEY IS GOING THE RESPONSE 
TODAY WAS ENCOURAGING 
WE WILL PUT 
IN THE WINDOW AND THE CUSTOMERS 
WILL UNDERSTAND THAT THE TIPS THEY 
ARE GOING TO THE WAITERS IT IS A 
GOOD IDEA 
IT IS NOT FAIR IF THE 
COMPANY USES YOUR TIP TO PAY YOUR 
WAGES THE TIPS IS YOUR TIPS AT AT THE MOMENT IT IS DISCRETIONARY BUT 
WITH PIZZA HUT THE FIRST BIG CHAIN 
TO SIGN UP IT IS HOPED OTHERS WILL 
FOLLOW OFFERING CUSTOMERS A MORE 
HONEST SYSTEM AND STAFF POSSIBLY 
HAVE A BIGGER SLICE IN THEIR PAY 
HUNDREDS OF TRAIN PASSENGERS WERE 
LEFT STRANDED AT EUSTON STATION 
TODAY AFTER A POWER SUPPLY PROBLEM 
CLOSED PART OF THE MAIN LONDON TO 
SCOTLAND ROUTE NETWORK RAIL SAID 
THE PROBLEMS WITH SIGNALS NEAR 
MILTON KEYNES ARE CLOSE TO THE SITE 
OF A SIMILAR FAILURE LAST TUESDAY 
WHICH STRANDED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE 
ON TRAINS 
AMY WINEHOUSE HAS BEEN IMMORTALISED 
IN A BRONZE STATUE THE SCULPTOR 
UNVEILED AT THE MALL GALLERIES IN

SILVERWARE THE KENT CLUB HAS EVER

FOR BIRD WATCHING LONDON MAY NOT 
BE TOP OF THE LIST BUT A NEW RACE 
ACROSS THE CAPITAL IS HOPING TO 
CHANGE THAT IT IS CALLED THE 
OYSTERCATCHER AND INVOLVES TEAMS OF 
TWITCHERS TRYING TO SPOT AS MANY 
SPECIES AS POSSIBLE USING ONLY 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT TO GET AROUND 
ON THE LEFT OF THE GRAVEL BANK

TRUST COLLECTION WETLANDS TRUST

BIRDSONG AND THE BUS AND THEN THE 
TUBE AND SO TO THE BUSY STREETS OF 
KENSINGTON GARDENS 
WE HAVE SEEN A 
FEW THINGS THE PARAKEETS WHICH

MORE SPECIES A LOT MORE TO IT THAN 
I NORMALLY WOULD SO IT HAS BEEN 
EVERY USEFUL DATA ME I HAVE FOUND 
A LOT MORE THAN I NORMALLY WOULD 
THE TEAMS FINISHED IN COVENT GARDEN 
HALF AN HOUR AGO OUR REPORTER IS 
WAITING IN THE WINGS FOR THE 
OYSTERCATCHER WINNERS WHO ARE

SPECIES WE DID IT FROM TRAVELLING 
TO THE NORTH END TO THE FURTHEST 
EAST THAT WE COULD IN LONDON 
DIFFERENT TEAMS WENT IN DIFFERENT 
DIRECTIONS EIGHTY NINE SPECIES WAS REALLY 
GOOD 
WHAT WAS SOME OF THE BEST GOOD LOCATIONS 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAVE LOCATIONS EVERYWHERE ALL THE FACTS WE 
VISITED HAD THEIR FAIR SHARE SOME 
SITES WILL RELEASE PACIFIC SPECIES 
THAT WE WENT FOR SO THEY WERE GOOD 
IN THAT SENSE AND REALLY 
SPECIFIC OTHERS HAD GOOD NUMBERS 
OF SPECIES DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE 
WERE YOU SURPRISED AT WHAT YOU SAW 
THIS IS VERY URBAN ENVIRONMENT 
THE PARTLY A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T 
THINK THEY THINK OF CONCRETE 
BUILDINGS AND NO GREEN SPACES BUT 
I WORK FOR THE WILDLIFE TRUST AND 
THERE IS LOADS OF GREEN SPACES 
AROUND LONDON PEOPLE SHOULD GET 
OUT AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY HAVE GOT 
YOU CAN FIND A LOT 
GET OUT AND SEE 
IT IT IS NOT A RACE YOU CAN FIND 
TRANQUILLITY ALL ACROSS LONDON SO 
JUST GET ON THE TUBE AND FIND THAT 
SPOT SPOT I HAD BETTER FINISH THE PROGRAMME 
FIRST HOW ABOUT A BIT OF 
NOSTALGIA REMEMBER COMIC 
FAVOURITES LIKE THE BEANO AND THE 
DANDY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY FIVE 
YEARS CHILDREN ARE GETTING A BRAND 
NEW COMIC BOOK THIS MONTH TWENTY FIRST 
CENTURY STYLE BRENDA EMMANUS WAS 
ON THE SOUTH BANK TO FIND OUT MORE 
THERE WAS A PARTY ATMOSPHERE AT THE 
B. F. I. SOUTH BANK WITH A HEALTHY DOSE 
OF ENTERTAINMENT SWEETS AND KITS 
THE D. F. C. THE FIRST STORY ETC FOR 
DECADES WAS BEEN LAUNCHED THE 
FIRST STORY COMIC 
THIS IS A 
RESTORATION OF CHILDREN'S WRITES 
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO A STORY 
COMIC EVERY WEEK AND OUR CHILDREN 
SHAMEFULLY HAVE NOT GOT ONE BUT 
WHAT I REMEMBER MOST WAS THE HEART 
POUNDING EXCITEMENT OF GETTING A 
COMET WITH STORIES ARE LOVE THE THE D. F. C. IS AVAILABLE ON SUBSCRIPTION 
AND WILL LOOK LIKE THIS THE 
CONTENT IS BEING PROVIDED BY A 
RENOWNED ILLUSTRATORS ARTISTS A 
NOVELIST AND CHILDREN'S WRITERS 
INCLUDING PHILIP PULLMAN THE 
AUTHOR WAS ON HAND TO DISCUSS THE 
ART OF STORYTELLING WITH INVITED 
GUESTS D. F. C. READERS WILL BE TREATED 
TO PHILIP'S CONTRIBUTION IT 
CLOSELY GUARDED SECRET UNTIL THE 
FIRST ISSUE BUT ENTITLED THE 
ADVENTURES OF JOHN BLAKE 
I AM 
TELLING A STORY IN A COMIC FORM 
WHICH I HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE AND 
IT IS A WONDERFUL WAY OF TELLING A 
STORY READ SWIFT A ECONOMICAL 
JUST LIKE A FILM ALL THE 
ADVANTAGES OF A CINEMA AND NONE OF 
THE DISADVANTAGES AND ALL OF THE 
ADVANTAGES OF A BOOK YOU CAN READ 
AT YOUR OWN SPEED IT IS A 
WONDERFUL WAY OF STORYTELLING EACH EACH ISSUE WILL FEATURE ORIGINAL COMIC 
STORIES AND PRESENT A HOST OF NEW 
CHARACTERS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH I I AM AHEAD OF A SECRET ORGANISATION 
OF TEENAGE SPIES I AM THE HEAD 
I AM A ROBOTIC A ROBOTIC VENDING 
MACHINE 
WE HAVE SHOWED ONLY TEST MACHINE COPIES SECRETLY TO CHILDREN AND DO 
YOU KNOW THE RESULT SILENCE 
SILENCE FOR TWENTY MINUTES AS THEY ARE 
SO ABSORBED BY THE STORIES 
THEN D. F. C. WILL GOBBLE UP TWO PER 
ISSUE AND IS AVAILABLE AT THE END 
OF THE MONTH THE D. F. C. 
I FEEL VERY MEAN GOING FROM COMICS 
TO PETER BUT WE DO NEED A CHECK ON 
THE WEATHER 
YOU BE CAREFUL 
THE OTHER EVENING I WAS ENJOYING AN 
ORANGE ICE CREAM WHAT A DIFFERENCE 
A DAY MAKES L. AM BACK NOW IN THE ORANGE WATERPROOFS 
A BIT MORE RAIN OVERNIGHT TONIGHT 
AS WELL TEMPERATURES AROUND TAM 
CELSIUS WE MIGHT GET ONE OF THE 
THUNDERSTORMS THAT HAS BEEN 
RUMBLING ACROSS THE BENELUX 
COUNTRIES THIS AFTERNOON THAT 
COULD TURN UP IN ESSEX OVERNIGHT 
TOMORROW THE MAIN DRAINAGE AREAS 
SHOULD PETER OUT THE SKIES SHOULD 
BRIGHTEN UP IF WE DO GET A BIT OF 
SUNSHINE I THINK IT WILL PROBABLY 
SET OFF A FEW SHOWERS IF WE GET 
SOME BLUE SKY US BUT SHOWERS COULD 
BE SHARP TEMPERATURES TOMORROW 
SIMILAR TO TODAY SOME BLUE SKIES 
TOMORROW AT THE WEATHER FRONT IS 
GIVING US WET WEATHER IT IS A HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER ICELAND WHICH COULD 
HELP US PUSHING HIGH PRESSURE 
TOWARDS THE WEATHER FRONT AND 
PUSHING IT BACK ACROSS THE CHANNEL 
ON SATURDAY IT LOOKS A RATHER GREY 
DAYS QUITE CHILLY MORE UP BRICKS 
OF RAIN BUT AS THE HIGH PRESSURE 
EXTENDS DOWN ACROSS THE BRITISH 
ISLES THINGS WILL BRIGHTEN UP 
MORE OUTBREAKS OF RAIN IT COULD BE 
LATER ON SATURDAY BEFORE WE SEE ANY 
SUNSHINE SO A BIT OF RAIN AND GREY 
SKIES FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS SUNDAY 
SHOULD BE BEST 
EARLIER WE ASK FOR YOUR THOUGHTS 
ABOUT THE IDEA SPARKED BY A THEATRE 
PLAY OF VICTIMS FORGIVING PEOPLE 
STEVE SAID HE DOESN'T THINK HE 
COULD FORGIVE ANYONE WHO KILLED A 
MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY HE THINKS HE 
WOULD SEEK SOME PERSONAL FORM OF 
REVENGE REVENGE ANOTHER GIRL SAID HER MOTHER WAS 
MURDERED BY HER PARTNER EIGHT YEARS 
AGO SHE SAID IF SHE HAD NOT 
FORGIVEN HIM SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
UNABLE TO COPE WITH THE LOSS OR GET 
ON WITH HER LIFE FORGIVENESS MEANT 
SHE COULD PUT THE BITTERNESS BEHIND 
HER HER ANOTHER BEREAVED PARENT SAYS SHE 
THINK IT IS A LOT TO ASK TO FORGIVE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE 
NOW TO THE MAIN NEWS REPORTS FROM 
CHINA SAY RESCUERS HAVE FINALLY 
REACHED THE AIRES CUT OFF BY 
LANDSLIDES AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE 
THE AREAS FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED 
BUT SURVIVORS ARE STILL BEING 
PULLED FROM THE RUBBLE 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS CONDEMNED 
THE BEHAVIOUR OF RANGERS FANS 
INVOLVED IN CLASHES YESTERDAY 
DURING THE SCUFFLES AND A POLICE 
OFFICER WAS TRIPPED UP AND STAMPED 
UPON UPON SIR IAN BLAIR HAS TOLD B. B. C. LONDON 
THAT PARENTS MUST PLAY A PART IN 
TACKLING TEENAGE KNIFE CRIME IN THE 
CAPITAL CAPITAL CHELSEA HAVE BEEN REFUSED 
PERMISSION TO HOLD A VICTORY PARADE 
IF THEY WIN THEIR FIRST EVER 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE TROPHY IT
