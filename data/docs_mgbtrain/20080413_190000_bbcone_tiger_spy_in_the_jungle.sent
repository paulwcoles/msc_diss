IF YOU WANT TO FILM TIGERS GET AN ELEPHANT 
PREFERABLY ONE THAT CAN CARRY A CAMERA 
THESE ELE CAMS HAVE ALREADY TOLD THE STORY OF FOUR CUBS GROWING UP 
THEY FILMED AS THE CUBS PRACTISED THEIR KILLING AND FIGHTING SKILLS 
BUT THEN THE CUBS' MOTHER WAS INJURED 
AND A ROGUE MALE ENTERED THEIR TERRITORY 
THIS WAS THE CUBS' GREATEST CHALLENGE YET 
THE CUBS FLEE ACROSS THE DAMMED LAKE IN THE CENTRE OF PENCH TIGER RESERVE 
THEY HAVE REASON TO BE WORRIED 
A STRANGE MALE WILL KILL CUBS SO THAT HE CAN HAVE THE CHANCE OF MATING WITH THEIR MOTHER 
THE CUBS MUST PUT AS MUCH DISTANCE AS THEY CAN BETWEEN THEM AND HIM 
THE MALE DECIDES NOT TO FOLLOW 
BUT WHILE HE'S AROUND THE CUBS ARE IN DANGER PARTICULARLY AS THEIR MOTHER IS INJURED 
THEY REACH THE FAR SHORE 
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BOUGHT SOME TIME THEY ARE STILL IN DANGER 
FOR THEIR FATHER WHEN LAST SEEN WAS ALSO INJURED 
THE ELEPHANT CAMERA TEAM SET OFF TO FIND HIM 
THEY HEAD TOWARDS THE ALARM CALLS OF PREY THAT SO OFTEN GIVE AWAY A TIGER'S LOCATION 
AND HERE HE IS THE APTLY NAMED CHARGER 
HE WAS LAST SEEN NEARLY TWO WEEKS AGO 
THEN HE HAD WOUNDS ON HIS SIDE FROM A FIGHT AND WAS UNUSUALLY SUBDUED 
BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY NOW 
HE'S BACK TO HIS OLD BELLIGERENT SELF 
THE CUBS ARE NOT FAR AWAY 
NOW WITH CHARGER BACK TO FIGHTING FITNESS THEY HAVE SOME MUCH NEEDED PROTECTION 
BUT WHAT THEY NEED RIGHT NOW IS A MEAL 
THEY'RE FIFTEEN MONTHS OLD AND CERTAINLY BIG ENOUGH TO CATCH A SMALL DEER 
BUT HAVE THEY YET DEVELOPED THE NECESSARY SKILL 
HERE'S A CHANCE FOR THEM 
THEY'LL HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT IF THEY'RE TO SURVIVE AS ADULTS 
THEY STILL NEED THEIR MOTHER'S HELP AND TUITION 
THE ELEPHANTS CHECK TO SEE HOW SHE IS GETTING ON 
THEY FIND HER WHERE THEY SAW HER LAST 
THE WOUND ON HER SIDE IS STILL VISIBLE 
BUT SHE SEEMS CONSIDERABLY PERKIER 
TIGER SALIVA CONTAINS A STRONG ANTIBIOTIC SO EVEN SERIOUS WOUNDS RARELY GO SEPTIC 
IT SEEMS SHE MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT 
THE CUBS WHEN WITHOUT HER STICK CLOSELY TOGETHER 
WHEN ONE MAKES A MOVE THEY ALL DO 
THEY CAN'T RESIST PLAY FIGHTING 
EVEN THOUGH THE STRANGE MALE MUST STILL BE ON THEIR MIND 
THEN A TIGER SEEMS TO APPEAR IN THE WATER 
THE CUB TRIES AN ALTERNATIVE CROSSING BUT THE WATER TIGER IS THERE AS WELL 
BEST TO TAKE THE LONG WAY ROUND 
SUBMERGED TIGERS FORGOTTEN HE JOINS THE GAME 
THE CUBS MUST SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT ON THEIR OWN 
NEXT DAY THE CUBS HAVE CAUGHT SOMETHING 
IT'S A PANGOLIN A SCALY ANTEATER 
THEY LAST ENCOUNTERED ONE WHEN THY WERE JUST A FEW MONTHS OLD 
THEN IT SCARED THEM 
NOW IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY 
THIS SLOW MOVING ANIMAL MUST HAVE BEEN EASY TO CATCH 
IT MAY BE INTERESTING BUT IT'S NOT MUCH OF A MEAL 
PANGOLINS EXUDE A FOUL ODOUR LIKE A SKUNK 
SO FEW ANIMALS EAT THEM AND THE CUBS DECIDE NOT TO TRY 
THEY'RE SO ABSORBED IN THEIR GAME THEY NEARLY MISS AN IMPORTANT ARRIVAL 
IT'S THEIR MOTHER 
THEY ARE SAFE ONCE MORE 
SHE SEEMS FULLY FIT 
HER CUBS ARE HUNGRY AND SHE LEADS THEM AWAY TOWARDS THE BEST HUNTING GROUNDS 
LOG CAM CAN FILM ANIMALS AUTOMATICALLY 
IT WILL SWITCH ITSELF ON WHEN SOMETHING IS HAPPENING EVEN WHEN THE ELEPHANTS ARE NOT AROUND 
ONE HAS RECORDED GOLDEN JACKALS AND THEY HAVE GOT PUPS JUST THREE WEEKS OLD 
THERE ARE SIX OF THEM AND THEY'VE JUST STARTED TO VENTURE OUT OF THE DEN 
BUT FOR SAFETY THEY MUST STAY CLOSE TO THE ENTRANCE 
THIS PUP HOWEVER HAS OTHER IDEAS 
FORTUNATELY MOTHER QUICKLY SPOTS HIM 
SHE SHEPHERDS HIM BACK TO THE SAFETY OF THE DEN 
THE TIGER FAMILY ARE BACK AT THE LAKE BUT THIS TIME THEIR MOTHER IS WITH THEM 
SHE'S CAUGHT A SAMBAR DEER AND SEEMS INTENT ON DRAGGING IT INTO THE WATER 
THE CUBS APPEAR TO BE EAGER TO HELP BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE 
THEY'RE CERTAINLY ENJOYING THEMSELVES AND NEED LITTLE EXCUSE FOR A GAME OF CHASE 
TIGERS DO SOMETIMES KILL PREY IN WATER SO THIS IS ALL GOOD PRACTICE 
AS ARE THE RUNNING LEAPS AND THE RUGBY TACKLES 
THE MOTHER SEEMS TO HAVE HER OWN PLAN FOR THE CARCASS AND CONTINUES TO DRAG IT AWAY 
FOR HER CUBS IT'S STILL JUST A GAME 
THE NATURAL BUOYANCY OF HER KILL MAKES IT EASIER FOR THE MOTHER 
TO MOVE IT THROUGH THE WATER BUT THE CUBS AREN'T HELPING ONE LITTLE BIT 
SHE FINALLY DRAGS IT TO THE SHORE BUT OUT OF WATER IT'S HARD GOING 
THE CUBS STILL LOVE PLAY FIGHTING BUT AS THEY GET BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL 
THEIR BLOWS SELDOM MAKE SERIOUS CONTACT DURING THEIR SPARRING 
THE MOTHER PERSEVERES WITH HER PUZZLING MISSION 
SHE SEEMS TO BE TIRING UNLIKE HER CUBS WHO HAVE ENERGY TO SPARE 
THEIR PLAY IS NOW ABOUT TESTING EACH OTHER TO SEE WHO IS TOP CAT 
THE MOTHER'S CHOSEN OBSTACLE COURSE RUNS ACROSS AN INLET OF WATER THAT CUTS THOUGH THE SHORELINE 
SHE'S DETERMINED TO GET THE CARCASS TO THE OTHER SIDE 
THE CUBS SHOW NO INTEREST IN HELPING 
SAMBAR ARE INDIA'S LARGEST DEER 
THIS IS HARD GRAFT EVEN FOR A TIGRESS IN HER PRIME 
FEMALE CUBS PLAY MORE AGGRESSIVELY THAN MALES 
THEY MAY EVENTUALLY SET UP NEIGHBOURING TERRITORIES 
SO PERHAPS IT'S SAFER TO SORT OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES NOW BEFORE THEY CAN DO MUCH HARM TO ONE ANOTHER 
BUT IT WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE THEY ACQUIRE THEIR MOTHER'S FORMIDABLE STRENGTH 
WHEN THEY FINALLY FIGHT THEY SEEM TO REALLY MEAN IT 
PERHAPS AFTER ALL THEY REALISE THAT IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO CONTINUE 
AFTER THEIR MOTHER HAS BEEN LABOURING FOR AN HOUR HER INTENTIONS HAVE BECOME CLEAR 
SHE SIMPLY WANTED TO TAKE THE CARCASS INTO SHADE 
ROCK BEES ARE AMONG INDIA'S MOST DANGEROUS CREATURES 
THEY WILL LAUNCH DEVASTATING MASS ATTACKS TO PROTECT THEIR HIVE 
FORTUNATELY FOR THIS CRESTED HAWK EAGLE 
WHEN THEY'RE AWAY FROM THE NEST THEY'RE SURPRISINGLY GOOD NATURED 
THE CUBS ARE NOW SEVENTEEN MONTHS OLD 
THIS MALE CUB GREETING HIS MOTHER IS ALMOST AS BIG AS SHE IS 
ALARM CALLS RING THROUGH THE FOREST WHEREVER THEY GO 
MONKEYS OFTEN TEASE TIGERS IN THIS WAY SECURE IN THE KNOWLEDGE 
THAT NO TIGER WILL EVER CATCH THEM UP IN THE TREES 
THE TIGERS ARE DOZING SO THE LANGURS VENTURE DOWN TO THE GROUND 
BUT NONETHELESS THEY MUST PREPARE TO BE CHALLENGED 
THE HAWK EAGLE TRIES TO MAKE HIMSELF LOOK BIGGER 
FOR THE MOMENT THERE'S A STAND OFF 
BUT THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE WINNER IN A CONTEST LIKE THIS 
A MACAQUE MONKEY IS MORE CONFIDENT 
AND A CRESTED SERPENT EAGLE GETS THE SAME TREATMENT 
LOG CAM AND THE OTHER REMOTE SPYCAMS CONTINUE TO DOCUMENT THE TIGER'S ONCE SECRET WORLD 
WHEN THE TIGERS START TO MOVE THE ELEPHANTS AND THEIR MOBILE CAMERAS 
TAKE OVER AND ENABLE US TO TRAVEL WITH THE TIGERS AT THEIR LEVEL 
BY NOW THIS WILD BUNCH HAVE LITTLE TO FEAR AND THEY STRIDE THROUGH THE FOREST WITH CONFIDENCE 
A GROUP OF TIGERS SUCH AS THIS IS A RARE SIGHT INDEED 
ADULT TIGERS ARE BASICALLY LONERS 
THEY DON'T PRACTICE THE KIND OF COMMUNAL HUNTING TECHNIQUES 
FOR WHICH LIONS WHO DO LIVE IN LARGE GROUPS ARE FAMOUS 
FINDING PREY IS THE EASY BIT 
TO SUCCEED THEY WILL HAVE TO GET CLOSE WITHOUT ALARMING THE DEER 
AT FIRST THAT LOOKS DECEPTIVELY EASY 
THE CUBS MUST BE FEELING THAT THEY COULD WALK RIGHT UP TO THEIR PREY 
SHE CHECKS THAT HER BROTHER IS BACKING HER UP 
AND PREPARES FOR THE CHARGE 
BUT THE DEER KNOW JUST HOW CLOSE IS SAFE 
HER BROTHER TRIES A SWIFTER APPROACH 
BUT HE PEAKS TOO SOON 
ALL IS NOT LOST 
THE DEER ARE RUNNING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ONE OF HIS SISTERS 
BUT SHE DIDN'T TAKE HER CHANCE 
THE YOUNGSTERS STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN 
MOTHER ISN'T FAR AWAY AND SHE IS WELL HIDDEN 
NOW IT'S HER CHANCE 
BUT THE SAMBAR'S KICKS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE DEFENCE ANOTHER FAILURE 
THE FAMILY MOVE ON TO TRY THEIR LUCK ELSEWHERE 
THEIR JOURNEY TAKES THEM NEAR THE JACKALS' DEN 
WHILE THEIR MOTHER IS AROUND THE PUPS ARE NOW VERY CONFIDENT 
THEY EVEN FOLLOW HER FOR SHORT FORAYS AWAY FROM THE DEN 
JACKALS WILL SCROUNGE FROM TIGER KILLS 
BUT THIS IS TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT 
FOR THE TIGER CUBS EACH NEW LOCATION IS ANOTHER PLAYGROUND 
THEY IMMEDIATELY TRY OUT THE FACILITIES 
A LEANING TREE PROVIDES LOTS OF POSSIBILITIES FOR GAMES 
BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER WAYS OF HAVING FUN IN THIS JUNGLE GYM 
THEY ONLY PLAY IN THE COOL OF THE MORNING 
WHEN THE DAY BEGINS TO HEAT UP THEY REST IN THE SHADE 
THE HEAT DRAWS GAME TO THE WATER HOLES AS THE MOTHER KNOWS IT WILL 
SHE BRINGS ONE DOWN 
IT'S A SPOTTED DEER 
THE CUBS HAVE HEARD THE COMMOTION AND ARE QUICKLY ON THE CARCASS 
WHEN FOUR CUBS COMPETE FOR FOOD 
THE WEAKEST FREQUENTLY LOSES OUT AND MAY EVENTUALLY DIE FROM STARVATION 
BUT AMONG THESE CUBS EVEN THE SMALLEST A FEMALE SEEMS WELL NOURISHED 
APPARENTLY MOTHER IS SUCH A GOOD HUNTER THAT THERE'S ALWAYS ENOUGH TO GO ROUND 
BUT THEY STILL QUARREL OVER THEIR MEALS 
AND IT'S USUALLY THE FEMALES THAT START THE ARGUMENT 
FOR THE NEARBY JACKALS THIS IS A BIT OF LUCK 
THEY SEEK OUT KILLS HOPING FOR A SHARE IN THE SPOILS 
THE CUBS HAVE YET TO LEARN WHAT SKILLED DODGERS JACKALS CAN BE 
BY NOW THEY WILL HUNT ANYTHING THAT MOVES AND THE JACKAL SEEMS TO BE AN EASY TARGET 
UNLIKE THEIR NORMAL PREY SHE ACTUALLY RUNS TOWARDS THE TIGERS 
THIS IS BLATANT PROVOCATION 
THE ATTACK CAME AS A SURPRISE TO THE JACKAL BUT SHE IS FAR TOO AGILE TO BE IN ANY REAL DANGER 
THE CUBS ARE QUITE USED TO FAILURE 
WITH THE TIGERS SO CLOSE THE MOTHER JACKAL DECIDES TO MOVE HER PUPS 
THIS ONE IS QUITE A BUNDLE BUT FORTUNATELY THE REST 
ARE QUITE CAPABLE OF FOLLOWING UNDER THEIR OWN STEAM 
JACKALS ALWAYS HAVE ALTERNATIVE DENS FOR EMERGENCIES 
THIS ONE IS IN THE HOLLOW OF A FALLEN TREE 
AS THE DAY HEATS UP TWO OF THE CUBS TAKE TO WALLOWING IN THE MUD 
AN EFFECTIVE IF RATHER MESSY WAY OF KEEPING COOL 
THE OTHERS ARE STILL GETTING RID OF THEIR SURPLUS ENERGY 
NOT VERY ELEGANT BUT AT LEAST HE'S NOT ALONE 
THE MUD LOOKS PERMANENT BUT IN JUST A FEW HOURS IT WILL BLOW AWAY 
AS DUST AND THE CUBS WILL BE SPOTLESS AGAIN WITH THEIR COATS DRY CLEANED 
PEACOCKS ORIGINATED IN INDIA AND HERE IN THE WILD THEY ARE QUITE NERVOUS CREATURES 
THEY'RE SO INOFFENSIVE THAT LANGURS ALLOW THEM TO SHARE THEIR WATERHOLE 
THEY ARE OCCASIONALLY KILLED AND EATEN BY TIGERS BUT THEY'RE MORE OF A SNACK THAN A MEAL 
THE CUBS SEEM TO BE FASCINATED BY THEM 
LIKE MANY BIRDS PEACOCKS WILL MOB PREDATORS 
AND KEEPING DANGER IN THEIR SIGHTS HELPS PREVENT A SURPRISE ATTACK 
THEIR MOCKING MUST BE INFURIATING FOR THE CUBS 
THEY PLAY A GAME OF DARE AS SOON AS HE LOOKS AWAY 
THIS REALLY IS TEASING 
HE LOSES PATIENCE 
HIS SISTER MAKES AN EASIER TARGET 
AS THE CUBS GROW IN CONFIDENCE THEY TACKLE ALMOST ANYTHING 
A TAIL TO THEM MUST BE LIKE A PIECE OF STRING TO A KITTEN 
BUT WHAT IT'S ATTACHED TO IS AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT PROPOSITION 
WISELY THE CUB THINKS BETTER OF IT 
WILD BOAR ARE DIFFERENT 
THEY ARE PREY 
THIS ONE SEEMS TO HAVE A SPOT OF CRAMP 
YET ANOTHER FAILURE 
THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE ELEPHANTS TO TAKE ANOTHER OF THEIR SIX WEEK BREAKS 
WHEN THEY RETURN THEY HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN LOCATING THE CUBS AGAIN 
THE ALARM CALLS OF PREY QUICKLY REVEAL WHERE THEY ARE 
THE TIGRESS IS WITH THEM THEY ARE STILL LIVING TOGETHER AS A FAMILY 
THE ELEPHANTS PUT TRUNKCAM DOWN AND LEAVE IT TO MAKE THE FINAL APPROACH UNDER ITS OWN POWER 
THE CUBS ARE FEEDING ON A CARCASS 
IT'S A WILD BOAR KILLED BY THEIR MOTHER 
THE CUBS ARE NOW NEARLY AS BIG AS SHE IS SO FEEDING THEM ALL IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR HER 
EVEN SO HER CUBS' BELLIES ARE RARELY EMPTY 
BUT FEEDING THEM SO WELL DOESN'T ENCOURAGE THEM TO HUNT FOR THEMSELVES 
THEY CERTAINLY HAVE THE AGGRESSION BUT THEY MUST LEARN HOW TO USE IT TO BRING DOWN PREY 
A GOOD MEAL IS USUALLY FOLLOWED BY AN AFTER DINNER SIESTA 
BUT EVEN THESE QUIET PERIODS ARE TIMES OF LEARNING 
ONE OF THE MALES TRIES SOME SEXUAL EXPERIMENTATION 
BUT HIS PARTNER HIS BROTHER IS RATHER BAFFLED 
THE ELEPHANT'S TAIL NO LONGER PROVOKES A REACTION 
EVERYONE IS JUST TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO GET COMFORTABLE 
ONE OF THE CUBS SEEMS TO BE BUILDING A NEST 
IF THAT WERE REALLY THE CASE IT WOULD BE VERY STRANGE BEHAVIOUR INDEED 
PERHAPS THE BAMBOO IS JUST IN HIS WAY 
OR MAYBE AS ROCKS AREN'T VERY COMFORTABLE HE'S TRYING TO MAKE THE LEAVES INTO A CUSHION 
ONE OF THE MALES GOES OFF TO SPEND TIME ON HIS OWN 
SPOTTED DEER APPEAR NEARBY 
THE CUB DECIDES TO TRY HIS LUCK 
HIS STALKING TECHNIQUE HAS GREATLY IMPROVED 
NOW HE'S ACTING LIKE A PRO 
HE USES A TREE TRUNK AS COVER 
HE PLACES HIS PAWS WITH GREAT CARE TO AVOID MAKING EVEN THE SLIGHTEST RUSTLE 
NOW HIS SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON HIS TIMING 
CLOSE BUT MISSED AGAIN 
NEVERTHELESS THIS IS REAL PROGRESS 
THE FAMILY HAS MOVED INTO THE SHADE BUT THERE IS VERY LITTLE SPACE 
BY THE TIME THE CUB RETURNS THERE IS NO PLACE FOR HIM 
HIS MOTHER MAKES IT CLEAR THAT HE'S NOT WELCOME 
SHE IS STARTING TO LOSE PATIENCE WITH HER GROWN UP FAMILY 
THE CUBS ARE ALSO FAR LESS TOLERANT OF ONE ANOTHER 
EVEN THEIR GAMES NOW HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE EDGE 
IT SEEMS THEY WANT TO PLAY BUT ARE NERVOUS AS TO WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN 
AGAIN IT'S THE FEMALES WHO SHOW THE MOST AGGRESSION 
THE SQUABBLING CONTINUES AS ONE FEMALE TRIES TO SETTLE DOWN FOR A REST 
EVENTUALLY THIS RIVALRY WILL FORCE THEM APART 
MOTHER IS EQUALLY HOSTILE SHE IS BEGINNING THE PROCESS OF MAKING HER CUBS LESS DEPENDENT ON HER 
MOTHER IS EQUALLY HOSTILE SHE IS BEGINNING THE PROCESS OF MAKING HER CUBS LESS DEPENDENT ON HER 
SO THE FEMALE CUB HAS TO FIND A SPOT OF HER OWN 
SHE IS NOT ALONE FOR LONG 
HER BROTHERS ARE STILL READY TO SHOW AFFECTION 
IT'S A PEACEFUL INTERLUDE BUT AN INCREASINGLY RARE ONE 
MONKEYS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE ALWAYS COMPANIONABLE 
REGULAR GROOMING MAINTAINS THE BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THEM 
LANGUR MONKEYS ARE PARTICULARLY SOCIAL 
THE FEMALES AND THEIR YOUNG LIVE IN FAMILY TROOPS LED BY A DOMINANT MALE 
THE JACKALS' NEW DEN IS NOT FAR AWAY 
THE MONKEYS SET OFF TO INVESTIGATE THE NEW ARRIVALS 
THE PUPS NOW REGULARLY VENTURE FROM THE DEN EVEN WHEN THEIR MOTHER IS AWAY 
BUT THEY VANISH INTO IT AT THE FIRST SIGN OF DANGER 
MONKEYS ARE INTENSELY CURIOUS AND THEY HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM JACKAL PUPS AS YOUNG AS THIS 
BUT MOTHER JACKAL IS A DIFFERENT MATTER 
IT'S NOW SAFE TO COME OUT TO PLAY 
THE PUPS HAVE STARTED TO EAT MEAT AND MOTHER JACKALS LIKE MANY DOGS 
HAVE A SPECIAL WAY OF DELIVERING IT TO THEM 
WHEN THE PUPS NUZZLE HER MOUTH SHE DISGORGES A MEAL 
WHILE THE TIGER CUBS WERE SLEEPING THE DEER HAVE BEEN ACTIVE 
IT'S THE TURN OF THE SECOND MALE CUB TO TRY HIS LUCK 
HE SUCCEEDED IN TAKING THEM BY SURPRISE BUT AGAIN HE WASN'T CLOSE ENOUGH 
HE IS LEARNING EXACTLY WHAT THE CRITICAL DISTANCE IS 
ALL INDIAN PREDATORS ARE UNDER CONSTANT HIGH ANGLE SURVEILLANCE 
AND LOOKOUT DUTIES FOR A LANGUR START AT A TENDER AGE 
DESPITE THE CHALLENGES LEOPARDS ARE GOOD AT CATCHING MONKEYS 
THIS ONE IS RETURNING TO AN EARLIER KILL 
BUT THE LEOPARD HAS UNWELCOME COMPANY 
ALTHOUGH LEOPARDS WERE ONCE A DANGER TO THE CUBS THE TABLES HAVE NOW TURNED 
THE LEOPARD WON'T RISK A FIGHT 
HE CAN SOON CATCH ANOTHER MONKEY 
SO THE MALE CUB STEALS A KILL 
ONE OF THE SPOTTER ELEPHANTS HAS GIVEN BIRTH 
THE CALF'S FATHER MUST BE ONE OF THE ELEPHANTS THAT CARRY THE SPYCAMS 
IT'S GREAT NEWS BUT ALSO A TOTAL SURPRISE 
NO ONE KNEW THE MOTHER WAS PREGNANT 
THE TIGERS ARE AT AN OLD FAVOURITE LOCATION THE DAMMED RESERVOIR THAT THEY USED AS SMALL CUBS 
THEY ARE NOW TWENTY MONTHS OLD 
NOT SO LONG AGO THE WHOLE FAMILY COULD FIT UNDER THIS LOG 
TIGERS ARE ALWAYS ON THE MOVE 
BUT THEY ARE ALSO CREATURES OF HABIT 
SO THAT ALTHOUGH THIS RESERVOIR IS TWICE THE SIZE OF AN OLYMPIC POOL 
A SPYCAM CAN BE PLACED BESIDE THE PRECISE SPOT THAT THE TIGERS WILL USE 
ELEPHANTS LOVE WATER TOO 
AND THEY START YOUNG 
THE COOL WATER HAS GIVEN THE CUBS NEW ENERGY 
ONE OF THEM HAS BECOME FASCINATED BY HIS REFLECTION IN THE POOL SIDE CAMERA 
ANOTHER CUB HAS DIFFERENT PREOCCUPATIONS 
THE RESERVOIR IS IN A DEEP HOLLOW WHICH CONCEALS THE TIGERS FROM OTHER FOREST DWELLERS 
HOW WILL HER HUNTING TECHNIQUE COMPARE WITH HER BROTHER'S 
SHE ADOPTS A SWIFT BUT STEALTHY APPROACH 
AND CLOSES THE GAP AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
CROUCHING LOW IS A GOOD MOVE 
A CAMERA ON THE OTHER SIDE SHOWS HOW WELL CAMOUFLAGED SHE IS 
THE DEER MAY BE SUSPICIOUS BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO SEE HER 
IT EVEN MOVES TOWARDS HER 
THE DEER ARE JUST ABOUT IN RANGE 
SHE MAY BE LEAVING IT TOO LATE 
THE DEER MAKES HER MIND UP FOR HER 
BUT SHE WASN'T CLOSE ENOUGH 
BACK AT THE DAM ONE OF HER BROTHERS IS HAVING HIS OWN ADVENTURE 
TIGHTROPE WALKING 
NOT SUCH A GOOD IDEA 
BUT TURNING ROUND IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT 
THE OTHER CUB'S FASCINATION WITH LOGCAM IS TURNING INTO AN OBSESSION 
HE INVESTIGATES FURTHER 
HE THEN SEES HOW IT WORKS UNDERWATER 
SOME ABOVE WATER PHOTOGRAPHY 
THEN UNDERWATER ONCE MORE 
WHEN THE ELEPHANT CREW RETURN A MONTH LATER THERE HAS BEEN QUITE A CHANGE IN THE FAMILY'S BEHAVIOUR 
ONE OF THE MALES IS FOUND BENEATH THE SHADE OF A TREE 
BUT HE SEEMS TO BE ALONE 
THEN SOME WAY AWAY THE SECOND MALE IS DISCOVERED 
THE TWO USED TO BE INSEPARABLE 
THIS ONE SEEMS TO HAVE INHERITED SOME OF HIS FATHER'S AGGRESSIVE NATURE 
THE FEMALES ARE FOUND TOGETHER BUT ALL IS NOT SWEETNESS AND LIGHT 
EVEN HERE THE ONE IN THE WATER MAKES IT CLEAR THAT SHE WANTS TO BE ALONE 
THE CUBS ARE BEGINNING TO SEPARATE 
TIGERS ARE SOLITARY HUNTERS 
LEARNING TO LIVE ALONE IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF GROWING UP 
BUT TO SURVIVE ON THEIR OWN THEY MUST SUCCEED AS HUNTERS 
AND THEY STILL HAVE TO PASS THIS CRUCIAL TEST 
AT LEAST HERE THEY HAVE PLENTY TO PRACTICE ON 
A JUNGLE CAT PAYS A VISIT 
ANY CAT MAKES THE DEER NERVOUS EVEN THOUGH JUNGLE CATS AREN'T BIG ENOUGH TO HARM THEM 
TIGERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE SOMETHING EVERYONE SHOULD WORRY ABOUT 
FORTUNATELY FOR THE JUNGLE CAT THE CUB IS TOO FOCUSED ON HER PREY TO NOTICE HIM 
SHE IS MAKING GOOD AND DETERMINED PROGRESS 
SHE'S LEARNT TO MOVE ONLY WHEN THE PREY IS NOT WATCHING 
AS SHE CLOSES THE DISTANCE HER MOVEMENTS SLOW 
AS YET SHE HASN'T BEEN SEEN 
THE DEER BOLTS SHE FOLLOWS 
THAT WAS CLOSE 
ALTHOUGH THE MALE CUBS ARE BECOMING MORE INDEPENDENT 
THEY SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER THAN THE FEMALES DO 
MALES ARE OFTEN ATTACKED BY OTHER MALES 
STAYING TOGETHER MAY GIVE THE BROTHERS SOME PROTECTION 
AT TWENTY MONTHS THEIR ONLY DANGER IS FROM PEOPLE AND OTHER TIGERS 
ALL ANIMALS FEAR THEM EXCEPT IT SEEMS THE SKITTERING FROGS 
THAT ARE HITCHING A RIDE ON THIS CUB'S BACK 
AS THEY MATURE THEY WILL FACE NEW DANGERS 
MALE CUBS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO TRAVEL OVER A ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILES 
TO FIND A TERRITORY OF THEIR OWN AND THESE JOURNEYS OFTEN BRING THEM CLOSER TO HUMAN HABITATION 
OUTSIDE THE RESERVE THEY WILL FACE CONFLICTS WITH FARMERS 
AND THEY ARE AT GREATER RISK FROM POACHING 
THERE ARE ALSO NO ELEPHANTS TO PROTECT THEM 
NEXT MORNING THE JUNGLE CAT IS FOUND DEAD 
THE CULPRIT APPEARS 
THE CUBS NOW KILL EVERYTHING THAT DARES CROSS THEIR PATH 
BUT IN COMMON WITH OTHER CATS THEY RARELY EAT OTHER CARNIVORES 
CATCHING A PROPER MEAL STILL ELUDES THEM 
BUT FRESH OPPORTUNITIES APPEAR EVERY DAY 
THE LARGER FEMALE TAKES UP THE CHALLENGE 
SHE MOVES WITH THE SAME EXPERT GRACE AS HER MOTHER 
ALL IS GOING WELL 
SHE PLACES EACH PAW WITH CONSUMMATE CARE 
SHE COULD HARDLY BE CLOSER 
SHE SELECTS HER TARGET 
AND GETS IT 
IT'S A FAWN 
FROM NOW ON FAWNS WILL BE HER MAINSTAY AS SHE PERFECTS HER HUNTING TECHNIQUES 
THE OTHER CUBS ARE NOT FAR AWAY 
BUT A FAWN IS TOO SMALL TO SHARE 
HER SISTER PUSHES HER LUCK 
CLAWS ARE UNSHEATHED FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THE CUBS ARE NOW REAL TIGERS 
THE MONSOON ARRIVES 
THE CUBS ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND BY NOW THEY MAY WELL HAVE LEFT THE RESERVE 
THE ELEPHANTS SET OUT TO SEE IF ANY OF THEM CAN BE FOUND 
A FEMALE IS SPOTTED FIRST 
SHE WAS THE BEST HUNTER SO IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT SHE IS THRIVING 
BUT IS SHE ALONE 
THE SECOND FEMALE 
IT SEEMS THAT THE SISTERS HAVE CARVED OUT SEPARATE TERRITORIES CLOSE TO THEIR MOTHER 
THEN ONE OF THE MALES APPEARS 
THIS IS MORE UNUSUAL 
PERHAPS PENCH HAS ENOUGH GAME TO SUPPORT HIM TOO 
THEN MOST REMARKABLY THE OTHER MALE IS ALSO SEEN 
THIS IS GOOD NEWS INDEED MOST TIGERS ARE KILLED OUTSIDE RESERVES 
IF THEY CAN FIND THEIR OWN SPACE HERE 
THEN THEY HAVE EVERY CHANCE OF SURVIVING AND HAVING CUBS OF THEIR OWN 
GIVEN PROTECTION TIGERS BREED VERY WELL 
THE INDIVIDUAL SUCCESS OF THESE CUBS 
BRINGS REAL HOPE FOR THE SURVIVAL OF ONE OF OUR MOST ENDANGERED ANIMALS 
AS FILMING COMES TO AN END ONE OF THE LOG CAMS IS FOUND TO HAVE RECORDED MORE GOOD NEWS 
THREE PRECIOUS NEW CUBS 
AND THEN A FOURTH 
AS THE STORY OF OUR FOUR CUBS ENDS A NEW ONE IS BEGINNING 
YOU'VE BEEN THE ONE TO BEAT 
THERE IS NO COMPETITION 
NO ONE'S GONNA MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME 
DING DING ROUND TWO 
WHICH IS BETTER THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT 
THE BIGGEST NAMES IN BRITISH T. V. GO HEAD TO HEAD
