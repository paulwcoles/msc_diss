THE TRENDY DESIGN THE NEED FOR SPEED AND THE LOVE OF GADGETS 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LISA 
AND NOW FOR OUR STUDIO AUDIENCE AND OF COURSE ALL OF YOU AT HOME 
BUT NOT FOR OUR PANEL HERE HERE'S WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
I. WAN 
I'M RIGHT IN BELIEVING WE'RE LOOKING FOR A FEMALE HERE IN THIS HOUSE 
THERE'S A LOT OF MALE 
THERE'S A LOT OF MANLY THINGS MOTORBIKES THINGS LIKE THAT 
THIS IS A GIRL WHO'S VERY MUCH INTO HER GADGETS AND HER OUTDOOR LIFE 
ADVENTURE 
ADVENTURE GLORIA 
THE CLUES IN THE FILM I FELT WERE QUITE MISLEADING 
COS IT'S A VERY FEMININE HOUSE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE 
VERY SOFTLY PUT TOGETHER WITH CANDLES AND CUSHIONS 
AND YET THERE ARE VERY HARD EDGES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE FILM 
AS YOU SAY THE BIKES AND THE HORSE RIDING 
THE BIKES ALMOST SEEM LIKE TOO OBVIOUS TO ME 
IS SHE ANYTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH RIDING 
THE BIKES 
NOT RIDING THE BIKES HORSE RIDING BECAUSE OF THE 
I THINK I THINK I THINK 
THEY'RE BOTH TO DO WITH HER LIFE ONE MORE THAN THE OTHER 
ACTUALLY THE THINGS THAT STRIKE ME 
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY WHO'S VERY VERY MODERN 
LIKE A BIT OF EDGE GOT A BIT OF EDGE TO HER 
AND I THINK BECAUSE OF THAT 
THEN IT'S NOT HORSE I THINK IT'S MOTORBIKES 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A GIRL HERE WHO'S 
I HOPE I CAN SAY THIS WHO'S VERY ATTRACTIVE 
BUT SHE'S ONE OF THE BOYS AS WELL SHE'LL GET STUCK IN 
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CLUES THERE WITH GADGETS 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL I THINK I KNOW BUT 
I THINK YOU DO 
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HER BEING ATTRACTIVE 
YOU REALLY KNOW DON'T YOU GO ON TELL US WHO IT IS 
IT'S SUZI PERRY 
IT'S SUZI PERRY 
WELL DONE WELL DONE 
SUZI PERRY IT IS BUT UNFORTUNATELY SUZI CAN'T BE HERE 
BECAUSE SHE'S AWAY WORKING ON LOCATION AND REPORTING AND SO ON 
SO WE'VE RECORDED HER CONVERSATION 
WE'VE TALKED TO HER AND WE'LL BRING IT TO YOU RIGHT NOW 
SUZI IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE IN YOUR HOUSE AND I CAN SEE 
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF CUTTING EDGE DESIGN AND GADGETS HERE 
THAT'S HARDLY SURPRISING WITH YOUR EIGHTH SERIES ON GADGETS 
YES I'M A BIT OF A GADGET GIRL 
SO IF SOMETHING CAN BE DONE WITH A GADGET 
I'VE INVARIABLY GOT IT IN MY HOUSE 
DESIGN IS SOMETHING THAT I ABSOLUTELY ADORE 
I LIKE KIND OF CLEAN LINES 
QUITE SORT OF MODERN FEEL BUT QUITE COSY AND HOMELY AS WELL 
YES HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE THE FACE OF MOTOR CYCLING 
A RATHER DAUNTING TITLE 
IT'S GREAT AND YOU KNOW I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH IT NOW 
THIS IS MY TWELFTH YEAR IN MOTORBIKES 
SO I FEEL LIKE I'M AN OLD SHOE IN THE PADDOCK 
I'M VERY COMFORTABLE AND PART OF THAT 
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PART OF MY LIFE 
IT HAS BEEN THE SPINE OF MY CAREER 
I JUST ADORE BIKE RACING I FIND IT SO EXCITING 
DID YOU LOVE IT AS A GIRL OR DID YOU COME UPON IT LATER 
LATER REALLY IN MY MID TWENTIES I KIND OF GOT INTO IT 
AND I LOVED WATCHING THE OVERTAKES I FIND IT VERY EXHILARATING 
I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND THEN I WAS HOOKED 
AND THEN I JUST BECAME REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT 
AND OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS QUITE A WHILE AGO 
WHAT'S THE MOST EXCITING RACE THAT YOU'VE WATCHED 
GOODNESS 
IT'S REALLY HARD TO PICK ONE RACE BUT I TELL YOU THE MOST EXCITING SEASON 
THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
WHEN NICKY HAYDEN AND VALENTINO ROSSI WERE TUSSLING FOR THE TITLE 
YOU COULDN'T HAVE SCRIPTED SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED 
EVERY SINGLE RACE HAD YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT 
YOU KNOW HAIRS STANDING UP ON YOUR ARM 
IT WAS FANTASTIC REALLY GREAT MOTOR SPORT REAL RACING 
JUST WHAT BIKES ARE ALL ABOUT 
AND ARE THE SKILLS REQUIRED BY WINNING BIKE RIDER 
THE SAME FOR A RACING CAR DRIVER OR ARE THEY DIFFERENT 
THE RIDER HAS A LOT MORE INPUT TO THE RACE RESULTS 
THAN YOU WOULD SAY IN FORMULA ONE 
JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A GREAT BIKE 
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WIN A RACE FOR EXAMPLE 
YOU HAVE TO BE AN EXCELLENT RIDER 
YOU HAVE TO BE SUPER FIT YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHEN TO MAKE THE RIGHT MOVES 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE REALLY BRAVE 
I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT CRAZY AS WELL 
IS IT MORE DANGEROUS THAN MOTOR RACING NOW 
IT'S MORE DANGEROUS THAN CAR RACING BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING AROUND YOU 
THERE'S NO ROLL CAGES IT'S YOU 
ALL YOU'VE GOT BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THE FLOOR ARE A SET OF LEATHERS EFFECTIVELY 
SO THEY HAVE TO BE REALLY GOOD 
AND THE GUYS ARE COMING OFF ALL THE TIME 
BUT IT'S JUST SUCH A SPECTACLE TO WATCH 
ONE OF THE MOST ADVENTUROUS THINGS YOU'VE DONE YOURSELF 
IS ONLY FOOLS ON HORSES FOR SPORT RELIEF AND YOU HAD WHAT 
ONLY THREE WEEKS TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT FROM SCRATCH 
WELL I LEARNED FROM SCRATCH I'D NEVER RIDDEN A HORSE AT ALL 
WE HAD TO LEARN TO BECOME SHOWJUMPERS IN 
IT WAS ABOUT SIX WEEKS ALTOGETHER 
BUT OBVIOUSLY STILL WORKING THROUGH THOSE TIMES AS WELL 
SO IT WAS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE I THINK I'VE EVER TAKEN ON IN MY LIFE 
WAS IT PAINFUL ABSOLUTELY DAVID IT WAS SO PAINFUL 
I GOT THROWN OFF MY HORSE SO MANY TIMES TO START WITH 
I COULD BARELY WALK 
AT NIGHT I'D BE SLEEPING SURROUNDED BY PILLOWS ALL OVER MY BODY 
COS I COULDN'T BEAR ANYTHING TOUCHING 
IT WAS HARD WORK BUT WOW BY THE END I WAS SHOWJUMPING 
AND IT WAS JUST BRILLIANT REALLY GOOD 
DO YOU STILL RIDE HORSES A BIT OR WAS IT JUST FOR THAT CHALLENGE 
I'VE CARRIED ON RIDING 
I HAVEN'T CARRIED ON SHOWJUMPING 
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY MORE OF A SPECIFIC ART AND SPORT AND SO ON 
BUT I REALLY ENJOYED IT AND I'VE BEEN ON A HACK DOWN RICHMOND PARK 
GOING ON LOTS OF HACKS AND THINGS AND I LOVE IT 
IT'S KIND OF LIKE BEING ON A MOTORBIKE 
BUT YOU'VE GOT AN ANIMAL WITH A BRAIN 
DO YOU LIKE RIDING MOTORBIKES AS WELL AS WATCHING YES YES 
AND COMMENTATING AND ALL THAT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL SAY TO ME DO YOU ACTUALLY RIDE 
AND YES I DO RIDE 
I'VE RIDDEN FOR ABOUT TWELVE Y. E. A R. S. 
AND THE FEELING OF FREEDOM BEING ON A BIKE RIDING ALONG THAT FEELING OF INDEPENDENCE 
ACTUALLY THE BEST FEELING IS WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH TRAFFIC 
I WAS JUST THINKING THAT COMING HERE TONIGHT 
MY GOODNESS ME THERE WAS A LOT OF TRAFFIC 
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE ON YOUR MOTORBIKE 
EXACTLY DEFINITELY THE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL 
AND YOU'VE DONE OTHER DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE ROYAL ASCOT AND SO ON 
YES WHAT ARE YOUR AMBITIONS TO DO 
WHAT ARE THE THINGS YOU HAVEN'T DONE YET 
GOODNESS IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT YOU KNOW 
WELL YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT YOU LOVE DOING 
YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT 
IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO THINK ABOUT DOING ANYTHING ELSE REALLY 
I LOVE WHAT I DO I LOVE PLAYING GAMES ON THE GADGET SHOW 
AND I LOVE WATCHING THE BIKE RACING SO I'M REALLY HAPPY 
I'M ACTUALLY NOT SUPER AMBITIOUS TO GO AND CONQUER THE WORLD OR ANYTHING 
I JUST WANT TO ENJOY WHAT I'M DOING 
AND LISA REFERRED TO THIS IN THE FILM BUT YOU'RE A WOLVES SUPPORTER 
YES HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT 
I'M FROM WOLVERHAMPTON ORIGINALLY REALLY YEAH IT'S MY HOMETOWN 
I THINK WHEN YOU'RE FROM A FOOTBALLING TOWN 
A WORKING CLASS TOWN IF YOU LIKE LIKE WOLVERHAMPTON 
IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD AND I DO I'M A BIG WOLVES FOOTBALL FAN 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL TO BE HERE IN YOUR HOME 
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO MY HOUSE

IT'S THE THROUGH THE KEYHOLE KEY 
YAY THE SACRED KEY

AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
I'M ON THE BALCONY OF A POSH PAD IN CHELSEA 
JUST BEHIND ME IS THE RIVER THAMES AND DOWN HERE ARE THE DOCKS 
AND IF THE WATER'S SO CLOSE 
THEN IT'S VERY HANDY TO HAVE A POWER BOAT OR TWO TO PLAY WITH 
WELL THERE'S EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN HERE REALLY 
INCLUDING ENOUGH TESTOSTERONE TO FLOAT A BATTLESHIP 
HEADY ATMOSPHERE YOU MIGHT SAY 
NOW I'M FEELING A BIT LADETTE ISH 
AND YOU KNOW HOW I LIKE TO GET INTO CHARACTER 
SO IF MY LADYLIKE BEARING SUDDENLY ESCAPES ME 
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND FORGIVE ME 
SO WHAT DO YOU DO IN A FLAT LIKE THIS WELL LET ME SHOW YOU 
YOU SIT ON THE SOFA YOU OPEN UP A BIT OF DECENT CLASSY READING 
YOU SHOUT TO YOUR FLATMATE 
O. I. BRING US A TASTY BEVERAGE A NICE CAN OF GOLDEN GOODNESS 
WHEN YOU'RE FED UP WITH THAT ONE MOVE ON TO SOME FINE LITERATURE 
WHEN YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT MOVE ON TO THE VIDEO GAMES 
O. I. HURRY UP WITH THAT BEVERAGE 
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG LET'S SEE WHAT'S ON THE TELLY 
SPORT I HOPE 
SO TO LIVE WELL YOU DON'T NEED MUCH IN THE WAY OF FRILLS 
A COMPUTER TO CHECK YOUR FIXTURES 
THE ORCHID'S A BIT MUCH THOUGH 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN ATTACKED BY A GIANT SWARM OF BEES OR WASPS 
IT'S DEFINITELY SEEN BETTER DAYS 
THERE'S NO POINT IN HAVING STUFF YOU DON'T NEED TWO MUGS ARE ENOUGH 
ONE FOR YOU ONE FOR YOUR MATE PLUS A SUPER DUPER COFFEE MACHINE 
TO GIVE YOU ENERGY SOME VITAMIN C. AND SOME CHAMPAGNE FOR EVERYBODY 
I CAN'T KEEP UP THIS LADETTE THING ANY MORE 
I'M TURNING BACK INTO A LADY 
NOW THE CONTENTS OF THE FRIDGE ARE SURPRISINGLY NORMAL 
I MEAN THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOOZE BUT 
IT'S QUITE HEALTHY 
NICE BEDROOM VERY NEAT AND TIDY 
WITH A COOL FLAT SCREEN TELLY IN THE CORNER 
AND I'VE NOTICED THIS D. V. D. THEY'RE WATCHING 
IT'S THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS 
GOD YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO BUMP INTO HIM WITHOUT A DOZEN OF YOUR FRIENDS AROUND YOU 
AND THEY'RE INTERESTED IN A BIT OF DOG TRAINING WITH THE DOG WHISPERER 
I'D IMAGINE THIS PERSON WOULD BE PRETTY GOOD WITH DOGS 
DOGS ENJOY A BIT OF ROUGH AND TUMBLE 
IN THIS OTHER BEDROOM THERE ARE EIGHTEEN PAIRS OF TRAINERS EIGHTEEN 
AND LOTS OF SPORTS KITS 
THERE'S A REAL INTEREST IN CARS WITH THIS BEDSIDE READING 
ANYTHING FOR A DEAL 
BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN BARGAIN OF THE CENTURY CAREFUL OWNER WANTED 
CLASSIC COCKTAILS BOOK 
AND VAN WILDER'S IT'S THE MUTT'S NUTS 
PERFECT REALLY 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN 
THE TWO SPEEDBOATS THE CULTURAL READING AND THE SPORTS KITS 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
THANKS LISA 
AND NOW FOR OUR HOME AND STUDIO AUDIENCE HERE'S WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
BIG D. WE BEGIN WITH YOU 
WELL 
THE POWER BOAT THE REFERENCES TO TESTOSTERONE 
THE MAGAZINES THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT JUST A MAN BUT A BLOKE 
VERY WELL PUT 
JUDGING BY THE WASHING AND THE UNTIDINESS HERE AND THERE 
A BLOKE WHO LIVES ON HIS OWN 
VERY GOOD THERE'S NO WOMAN IN THAT PARTICULAR 
THAT WE KNOW OF 
I RECOGNISE A FEW THINGS IN HIS LIFESTYLE TO MINE 
ARE WE LOOKING AT A PROFESSIONAL SPORTSMAN 
THE REASON I SAY THAT IS THE MAGAZINES ALL THE GAMES 
A BIT OF SPARE TIME SOMEONE WHO MAY TRAIN IN THE MORNING 
HAVE THE REST OF THE DAY TO RELAX 
AND I THINK WE'LL BE LOOKING AT A RUGBY PLAYER 
AND WHY DID YOU SAY RUGBY PLAYER 
I SAY RUGBY BECAUSE THERE IS A REFERENCE TO IF HE WAS IN TROUBLE 
HE WOULD CALL UPON HIS TWELVE MATES THAT MAKES THIRTEEN 
THIRTEEN RUGBY UNION 
AND THE FIXTURES THE FIXTURES 
AND ALSO A REFERENCE TO WASPS WHICH IS A WELL KNOWN RUGBY TEAM 
RUGBY UNION IS FIFTEEN 
IT'LL BE RUGBY LEAGUE THEN RUGBY LEAGUE IS THIRTEEN AIN'T IT 
I THOUGHT UNION UNION IS FIFTEEN YES 
THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY RUGBY UNION 
SO WHY DID SHE SAY YOU'D NEED TWELVE MATES 
WHICH WOULD MAKE THIRTEEN SHE DIDN'T KNOW 
DOES HE PLAY INTERNATIONALLY HE PLAYS FOR WASPS DEFINITELY 
WE THINK HE PLAYS FOR ENGLAND 
NO O. K. THE PERSON I'VE GOT IN MIND 
WHICH I DON'T THINK IT IS HIM BECAUSE I THINK HE'S A FAMILY MAN 
AND IT'S THE NAME YOU'VE GOT THERE 
WELL WE THINK NO IT'S NOT 
YOU TELL US WHO YOU WERE GOING TO SAY 
I WAS GOING TO SAY LAWRENCE DALLAGLIO 
ODDLY ENOUGH HE WILL PLAY A PART IN THE STORY 
BUT IT'S NOT HIM HE PLAYS A PART IN THE STORY 
HE OBVIOUSLY IS A TEAM MEMBER BECAUSE HE PLAYS FOR WASPS AS WELL 
DID HE PLAY IN THE ENGLAND TEAM THAT WON THE WORLD CUP 
THE WEBB ELLIS TROPHY FOUR YEARS AGO 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO 
HE PLAYED IN THE TEAM THAT DIDN'T WIN THE WORLD CUP LAST YEAR 
O. K. 
IS HE A WINGER BY ANY CHANCE THAT'S HIS POSITION 
I'VE GOT ONE OF A FEW IN MY MIND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER 
GO FOR IT BOYS GO FOR IT GO ON 
IS HE QUITE NEW TO THE RUGBY SCENE IN TERMS OF 
HE'S MADE A BREAKTHROUGH FOR ENGLAND IN THE LAST SEASON OR TWO 
YEP YEP 
I DON'T WANT TO SAY IF IT'S WRONG SAY IT 
CAN'T REMEMBER THE FIRST NAME IS IT PAUL SACKEY 
GOOD FOR YOU 
COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
PAUL SACKEY AND HIS WASPS COLLEAGUE AND FLATMATE TOM VOYCE 
AND THIS IS PAUL AS YOU KNOW AND THIS IS TOM 
AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WASPS COLLEAGUES AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN FLATMATES 
I'VE BEEN AT WASPS FOR FOUR YEARS NOW 
I'VE BEEN THERE FIVE YEAH 
WE'VE BEEN LIVING WHAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS TWO YEARS YEAH TWO YEARS 
DOES IT MAKE GOOD SENSE TO DO THAT 
HE'S THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE 
PARDON 
HE'S THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE YOU WISH 
BASICALLY HE'S QUITE LAZY SO I HAVE TO DO THE COOKING 
SO YOU MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS SHIPSHAPE 
I HAD TO TRY AND GET HIM HERE 
HIS RUNNING TO SCHEDULE'S REALLY BAD BASICALLY 
AND HOW DID YOU COME TO CHOOSE THE APARTMENT 
RIVERSIDE APARTMENT 
JUST LIKED THE LOOK OF IT I THINK TWO BOYS AT THE TIME 
WE WERE YOUNG FREE AND SINGLE AS THEY SAY 
SAW IT AND THOUGHT IT WAS AN IDEAL PLACE TO BE 
YOU'RE YOUNG ONCE YOU'VE GOT TO ENJOY THE LONDON LIFE 
AS MUCH AS THE RUGBY SO THAT'S THE DECISION 
HOW MUCH TIME DOES RUGBY TAKE UP DURING YOUR WEEK 
MONDAY TO FRIDAY IF THERE'S NOT A GAME 
IF THERE'S NOT A GAME NOT 
I DON'T THINK THERE'LL BE TOO MUCH COS WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO TRAIN THAT MUCH SO 
YOU DON'T 
IF THERE'S NOT A GAME WE MAY NOT BE TRAINING FULL ON 
LIKE WE WOULD IF WE WERE PREPARING FOR A GAME 
SO I'D EXPECT IT WOULDN'T BE AS INTENSE 
AS WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF WE WERE TRAINING 
AND HE'S LAZY SO WOULDN'T WANT TO TRAIN WHEN HE GETS THE DAY OFF HE'S ON THE SOFA 
AND HOW MANY CAPS HAVE YOU GOT TOGETHER SO FAR FOR ENGLAND 
I'VE GOT NINE I'M ON FOURTEEN AT THE MOMENT FOURTEEN YEAH 
AND WASPS IS ABOUT THE MOST FAMOUS NAME IN CLUB RUGBY IN BRITAIN 
YES I THINK WE WERE TOLD A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO 
MOST MOST SUCCESSFUL PROFESSIONAL TEAM 
IN THE PROFESSIONAL ERA SO WE'VE WON A FEW TROPHIES 
I'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE THERE FIVE YEARS AND WON SIX TROPHIES 
SO IT'S QUITE GOOD 
THERE WAS A TIME THAT PEOPLE SAID THAT THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE 
WOULD ALWAYS BEAT THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE AT RUGBY WASN'T THERE 
AND THEN WHEN WE WON THE WORLD CUP THAT LOOKED DIFFERENT YEAH 
YES 
BUT NOW HOW'S THE BALANCE TODAY DO YOU THINK 
BETWEEN SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE AND THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE 
I THINK IT'S QUITE EQUAL NOW 
OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS ONE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE TEAM 
IN THE FINAL AT THE WORLD CUP 
SO THE BALANCE IS GETTING QUITE EVEN AT THE MOMENT 
OBVIOUSLY THE EUROPEAN TEAMS ARE DOING REALLY WELL 
FRANCE ARE DOING REALLY WELL 
WE'VE DONE REALLY WELL IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
AHEM WALES 
WE PAUSE THERE FOR A BRIEF COMMERCIAL 
WALES IS DOING ALL RIGHT AT THE MOMENT 
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE NEW COACHING STAFF 
THEY'VE GOT AN ENGLISHMAN COACHING THEM 
AND TOM YOUR FAMILY RUGBY GOES RIGHT BACK IN YOUR FAMILY 
YES I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT WHEN I FIRST STARTED PLAYING RUGBY 
BECAUSE DAD DIDN'T WANT TO PUSH RUGBY ON TO ME 
AND I FOUND OUT MY GREAT UNCLE WAS PART OF THE FIRST DOUBLE GRAND SLAM WINNING TEAM IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR 
AND CAPTAINED ENGLAND AND ALSO WAS PRESIDENT IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES I THINK 
SO YEAH A GOOD HERITAGE 
FANTASTIC 
PAUL YOU NEARLY ENDED UP AS A SOCCER PLAYER DIDN'T YOU 
WITH CRYSTAL PALACE WAS IT 
YEAH I WISH I WAS NOW 
ONLY JOKING NO 
YOU MEAN THEY'RE PAID MORE I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A BIGGER FLAT 
I'M ONLY JOKING I DON'T REGRET THIS SITUATION I'M IN AT THE MOMENT 
I WENT TO A SCHOOL THAT PREDOMINANTLY PLAYED RUGBY SO 
SO THAT DECIDED IT IN THE END 
IT WAS FORCED UPON YOU WASN'T IT 
AND HOW DO YOU FITNESS IS ONE THING 
BUT HOW VITAL IN YOUR CASE HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN SPEED 
DO YOU TRAIN TO INCREASE YOUR SPEED 
I DO AND I'VE GOT A PERSONAL TRAINER OUTSIDE OF RUGBY AS WELL 
MARGOT WELLS ALAN WELLS'S 
ALAN WELLS THE GREAT SPRINTER 
YES SO I GO TO SEE HER THAT'S HOW I KEEP MY SPEED UP 
AND SHE'S DONE REALLY WELL FOR ME 
I'M REALLY REALLY GLAD I'M WITH HER 
DO EITHER OF YOU HAVE SUPERSTITIONS OR THINGS YOU DO BEFORE A GAME 
WELL THE BOYS TAKE THE MICK OUT OF US QUITE A LOT 
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE JOINED TO THE HIP THEY THINK 
AND WE ROCK UP IN ONE CAR GO INTO THE CHANGING ROOMS 
GOT THE MUSIC BLARING IN OUR EARS MUCKING AROUND HAVING A LAUGH 
THE BOYS ARE BASHING THEIR HEADS AGAINST THE WALL TRYING TO GET PSYCHED UP FOR THE GAME 
AND WE TAKE IT PRETTY EASY 
WHEN WE CROSS THE WHITE LINE AND THE WHISTLE'S BLOWING 
THAT'S WHEN WE SWITCH ON BUT WE LIKE TO HAVE A LAUGH QUITE RELAXED REALLY 
SO YOU DON'T GO THROUGH INCANTATIONS LIKE THE MAORIS DO 
NO WE HAVE A SET MORNING DON'T WE HE GETS UP HE'S THE WOMAN 
HE GETS UP AND COOKS BREAKFAST 
VERY NICE YES VERY NICE 
NICE POACHED EGGS OR SCRAMBLED EGGS 
BUT I CAN COOK WELL HE THINKS CAN COOK 
YOU KNOW I CAN COOK 
I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE ONLY LITTLE SUPERSTITION 
IS COOKING THE EGGS FOR THE MAN APPARENTLY 
COOKING EGGS WHICH WAY DOES HE NEED THEM 
RIGHT HE'S THE FUSSIEST GUY IN THE WORLD 
IF I COOK HIM SCRAMBLED 
THEY CAN'T BE TOO RUNNY YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THEM A LITTLE BIT RUNNY BUT THEY'VE GOT TO BE HARD 
WITH POACHED EGGS THE YOLK'S GOT TO BE HARD AS WELL NO NO 
POACHED EGGS ARE O. K. YOU DON'T LIKE IT TOO RUNNY 
POACHED EGGS ARE ALL RIGHT 
HE'S GOT TO HAVE TOMATO SAUCE I'VE GOT TO HAVE H. P. SAUCE SO YEAH 
SO THAT'S THE WAY THAT'S THE TRADITION OF GETTING YES 
I THINK PEOPLE FROM OTHER RIVAL COUNTRIES SEEING THIS WILL 
THEY'LL BE SCARED WON'T THEY THEY'LL ADOPT THIS SYSTEM 
OF POACHING EGGS NOT TOO RUNNY OR SCRAMBLED EGGS A BIT HARD 
HERE IS THE THROUGH THE KEYHOLE KEY WE'LL GET ANOTHER ONE THERE SHOULD BE TWO 
FOR THE MOMENT THIS KEY SAYS THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU 
THANKS FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ENGLAND AND FOR WASPS GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
