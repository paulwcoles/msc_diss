THE INSIDE TRACK ON FOOTBALL 
TENNIS AND FORMULA ONE TONIGHT ON 
INSIDE SPORT 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO INSIDE SPORT 
WITH ME GABBY LOGAN TONIGHT WE 
HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL MENU WITH A 
PEPPERING OF BRITISHNESS WE'LL 
BRING YOU TONIGHT'S PREMIER LEAGUE 
GOALS AS ARSENAL ARE AT DERBY BUT 
THE BIG TALKING POINT REVOLVES 
AROUND THE BATTLE AT THE BRIDGE 
WHY WAS THE LAWN MOWERS ON AFTER 
THE GAME YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CUT 
THE GRASS BEFORE THE GAME 
IN AL WEEK WHEN THREE BRITISH SIDES 
BATTLE IT OUT FOR THE FINAL SPOTS 
DES KELLY ASKS IS THE STRENGTH OF 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE A GOOD OR A BAD 
THING FOR THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
HE'S GONE TO THE TOP IN HIS QUEST 
FOR ANSWERS 
ULTIMATELY WE ARE 
COMPETITORS AND WE ARE VERY 
PLEASED OUR CLUBS ARE SUCCESSFUL 
HE'S THE SAME AGE AS ANDY MURRAY 
BUT HE'S ALREADY GRAND SLAM 
WINNER AND THE WORLD NUMBER THREE 
I MET UP WITH SERBIAN TENNIS STAR 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC WHO HAD A WORD OF 
WARNING FOR BRITISH TENNIS 
IN U. K. 
A LOT OF KIDS ON A LITTLE BIT 
SPOILED BECAUSE OF ALL THE 
CONDITIONS THEY HAVE SO THEY DON'T 
KNOW THE REAL MEANING OF THE TENNIS 
AND THEY DON'T WORK HARD ENOUGH 
HOW DO F. ONE STARS SPEND THEIR DAY 
OFF THEY GO DRIVING DAVID CROFT 
WATCHED SOME OF THE BIG NAMES GO 
FOR THE FLAG TO MARK RUBENS 
BARRICHELLO'S RECORD BREAKING 
CAREER 
FOR ME IT IS SUCH A PROUD CAREER MOMENT TO BE HERE NOW AND TO BE 
COMPETITIVE MORE THAN ANYTHING 
ELSE 
WITH ME TONIGHT DES KELLY OF THE 
DAILY MAIL AND SPORTS BROADCASTER 
TONY LIVESY 
WELL LET'S GET UP TO DATE WITH THE 
PREMIERSHIP ARSENAL SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN TITLE CONTENDERS TONIGHT THEY 
SHOWED WHY IT WAS A SIX TO TWO DRUBBING 
OF DERBY IT STARTED WITH NICKLAS 
BENDTNER VAN PERSIE CAME NEXT AND 
THEN ADEBAYOR MADE IT THREE TO ONE N'GOTTY 
ALSO GOT ON TO THE SCORESHEET 
ADEBAYOR COULD NOT STOP COULD NOT 
STOP SCORING FINALLY COMPLETING 
HIS HAT TRICK TO MAKE IT SIX GOALS 
FOR ARSENAL TWO FOR DERBY 
IT IS AN INTRIGUING TWO HORSE RACE 
NOW BETWEEN MANCHESTER UNITED AND 
CHELSEA MANCHESTER UNITED AT HOME 
TO WEST HAM NEXT CHELSEA ARE AWAY 
TO NEWCASTLE AND THEN AT HOME TO 
BOLTON ON THE LAST DAY OF THE 
SEASON 
THE HEADLINES FROM THE WEEKEND 
DIVERTED ATTENTION FROM THE 
PREMERSHIP TITLE RACE 
CONCENTRATING INSTEAD ON FISTICUFFS 
AND ALLEGATIONS OF RACIAL SLURS 
HOWEVER THE MAN UNITED V. CHELSEA 
MATCH WAS TENSE AFFAIR FROM START 
TO MORE THAN THE FINISH CHELSEA 
DREW FIRST BLOOD APART FROM 
VIDIC'S FACE BUT THEN IT APPEARED 
THAT CHELSEA HAD HIT THE SELF 
DESTRUCT BUTTON ROONEY POUNCED ON 
A MISTAKE TO EQUALISE BUT MICHAEL 
BALLACK GOT THE PENALTY TO CONFIRM 
THE VICTORY RIO FERDINAND KICKED 
THE STEWARD ACCIDENTALLY AND THEN 
THIS THESE PICTURES ARE FROM A 
FRENCH TELEVISION CHANNEL WE ARE 
NOT IMPLICATING ANY CHELSEA PLAYERS 
IN THIS INCIDENT THIS IS WHAT SIR 
ALEX FERGUSON HAD TO SAY THIS 
AFTERNOON AFTERNOON WE ARE DELIGHTED THAT THE F. A. ARE 
LOOKING INTO THIS 
IT'S SUCH TENSE END TO THE SEASON 
IS THE PRESSURE GETTING TO THEM 
YOU CANNOT EXPLAIN IT ANY OTHER WAY 
ALEX FERGUSON HAS GOT A PLAYFUL 
SMIRK ON HIS FACE WHICH SUGGESTS 
HE MAY FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT THE 
INQUIRY BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THE 
TENSION HAS BEEN BUILDING UP AND I 
THINK THE MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN 
SETTING THE TONE COMPLAINING ABOUT 
PENALTY DECISIONS FIXTURE PILE UP 
FATIGUE IT CREATES SORT OF 
PARANOIA AROUND THE CLUB AND IT 
EXPLODED 
I THINK FERGIE LOVES THIS EXPLODED SORT OF THING HE HAS BEEN 
RATCHETING IT UP THAT COMMENT 
ABOUT THE LAWN MOWERS IS THE MOST 
TELLING ONE HE IS ALMOST IMPLYING 
THAT CHELSEA WERE OUT THERE TRYING 
TO NAGEL MANCHESTER UNITED IF 
ANYTHING IS DESIGNED TO GET 
MANCHESTER UNITED TOGETHER THIS IS 
IT THESE PLAYERS ARE LIKE 
RACEHORSES CONTROLLED AGGRESSION 
HE'S GOING TO GET THEM TO BOILING 
POINT 
BUT IT IS NOT CONTROLLED AT POINT THE MOMENT 
IF YOU HAD SEEN THEM 
TRAINING TODAY BIG SMILES ON THEIR 
FACES I THINK THAT WILL END UP 
BRINGING THEM CLOSER TOGETHER IT'S 
COULD DO BUT THE CHOPPING AND 
CHANGING OF THE SIDE THE SUDDEN 
ADAPTING OF CAUTIOUS TACTICS 
THINK HAS DISTRACTED THEIR RHYTHM 
AT LEAST THE SITUATION IS CLEAR CUT 
NOW THEY MUST ATTACK THEY CANNOT 
SIT BACK THEY ARE NOT THE SAME 
SOLID WHEN THEY DEFEND THINK 
WITH THIS CLEAR TACTIC THEY WILL 
BE STRONGER 
THE REPERCUSSIONS WILL 
GO ON BUT WHAT ABOUT FOR RIO 
CAPELLO IS LOOKING FOR HIS CAPTAIN 
IS THIS THE KIND OF THING WHICH 
CAPELLO MAY NOT LOOK FAVOURABLY 
UPON 
ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT IS UPON DO YOU WANT A GOOD LOSER AS ENGLAND 
CAPTAIN ON THE OTHER HAND YOU 
HAVE GOT TO QUESTION YOUR POTENTIAL 
CAPTAIN IF HE IS GOING TO START 
PUTTING WALLS BOOTING CAPELLO CAPELLO HAS BROUGHT THIS WHOLE MORAL 
DIMENSION INTO THE CAPTAINCY THEY 
ARE IN THE REFEREE'S FACE THEIR 
UNDERMINING THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF 
CAPTAINCY AS KAPOSI'S IT L. THINK 
IT HAS HARMED RIO'S CHANCES WITH 
THE SUMMER AHEAD AND A POSSIBLE 
STAG NIGHT FOR ROONEY IN LAS VEGAS 
THERE MAY BE MORE THINGS UP AHEAD 
THIS IS HANDBAGS L. L. HAVE SEEN 
BIGGER FIGHTS ON A SATURDAY NIGHT 
YES A LOT OF THIS STUFF HAPPENS IN 
THE TUNNEL AND WE NEVER SEE IT L. 
DO NOT THINK IT IS OF GREAT 
CONSEQUENCE BUT IT GIVES AN 
INDICATION OF THE NERVES AND 
DETENTION DETENTION THEY THOSE PICTURES WERE JUST A 
POULAT PRESENTATION OBVIOUSLY WE 
WILL LEARN MORE JUST A PARTIAL 
REPRESENTATION REPRESENTATION THIS YEAR'S CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 
COULD BE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER 
AN ALL ENGLISH AFFAIR INDEED THE 
BOOKIES SAY LAST SATURDAY'S CLASH 
BETWEEN CHELSEA AND MAN UNITED MAY 
WELL HAVE BEEN A DRESS REHEARSAL 
FOR THE FINAL IN MOSCOW ON 
TWENTY FIRST 
DES KELLY HAS BEEN SOUNDING OUT 
OPINIONS ON WHETHER THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE'S MONOPOLY OF THE 
COMPETITION IN RECENT YEARS IS 
HEALTHY FOR THE GAME IT IS THE 
FOURTH YEAR IN SUCCESSION THAT A 
PREMIER LEAGUE CLUB WILL BE 
REACHING THE FINAL OF THE 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE IT SHOWS THE 
POWER AND THE DOMINANCE OF THE TOP 
CLUBS BUT AT WHAT PRICE IS THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE EATING THE GAME 
YOU SAY THE PREMIER LEAGUE IS 
DOMINATING EUROPE I THINK THERE 
FOUR SIDES ARE DOMINATING EUROPE 
THE FINANCIAL CLOUT THAT THEY'VE 
GOT THE PLAYERS THAT THEY'VE GOT 
AS I SAY YOU CAN SEE THAT 
CONTINUING FOR SOME PARTICULAR TIME 
WE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A FEW YEARS 
AGO WITH THE ITALIAN TEAMS AND WE 
THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO DOMINATE 
FOR A WHILE AND THEN THEY FELL 
AWAY IT'S JUST THAT THE STRONGEST 
LEAGUE AT THE MOMENT IS THE ENGLISH 
LEAGUE 
I THINK WE ARE THE ENVY OF LEAGUE MANY OTHER LEAGUES NOT NECESSARILY 
THE SPANISH AND THE ITALIANS BUT 
CERTAINLY THE FRENCH THE GERMANS 
I THINK THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO GET 
THERE AND TRYING TO GET THEIR 
CLUBS BACK INTO THE SORT OF SUCCESS 
THEY HAVE HAD IN THE PAST 
IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE PAST 
THREE OR FOUR DECADES THE HONOURS 
HAVE BEEN FAIRLY EVENLY SHARED 
AROUND THE CONTINENT BUT IF 
ANYTHING ENGLISH CLUBS HAVE UNDER 
ACHIEVED A LITTLE CAN IT REALLY BE 
FOUR YEARS SINCE JOSE MOURINHO HAS 
SURPRISED EVERYBODY BUT HIMSELF 
PERHAPS BY PICKING UP THE EUROPEAN 
CUP WITH PORTO 
OTHER TEAMS IN 
OTHER COUNTRIES ARE ALSO APPLICABLE 
OF PLAYING GOOD FOOTBALL CAPABLE 
IT IS NOT THAT YOU HAVE TO BE 
OR MORE FOCUSED YOU CAN BE TOO 
WITH THE 
LEAGUE IT'S DIFFICULT 
I THINK THE 
ITALIANS WILL COME AGAIN NEXT YEAR 
ADDING REAL MADRID IN PARTICULAR 
WILL IMPROVE THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
YEARS I MEAN I THINK IT'S STILL 
VERY MUCH OPEN 
IT TENDS TO COME IN 
CYCLES AND THE ITALIANS AND 
SPANISH AND THE GERMANS WILL COME 
AGAIN WE WON'T HAVE IT ALL OUR OWN 
WAY THAT IS FOOTBALL IT WILL COME 
ROUND IN CIRCLES AGAIN BUT LONG 
MAY THIS CURRENT RUN OF SUCCESS 
CONTINUE 
WITH ALL ITS GLAMOUR CONTINUE EXCITEMENT AND GLOBAL APPEAL THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE IS A MAGNET FOR THE 
WORLD'S BEST TALENT BUT IF THAT 
TREND CONTINUES WILL BARCELONA AND 
REAL MADRID BE ABLE TO KEEP UP AND 
DOES IT REALLY MATTER THE MAN AT 
THE 
NOT SEEM TO CARE A IT 
A IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE BASICALLY THE 
WHOLE WORLD LOOKS AT THE CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE AND SEES THAT ENGLISH TEAMS 
ARE THE BEST AT THE MOMENT IN 
EUROPE THIS IS VERY GOOD 
ADVERTISING FOR THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
PACK A FEW YEARS AGO WE USED TO 
GET THE ITALIANS AND THE SPANISH 
PLAYERS AT THE END OF THEIR CAREER 
IT WAS LEVELLED AGAINST THEM THEY 
WERE TOPPING UP THEIR PENSIONS I 
DON'T THINK THAT IS THE CASE ANY 
MORE WE CAN GO OUT THERE TO SOUTH 
AMERICA AND BRING IN THE BRAZILIANS 
AND THE ARGENTINIAN PLAYERS THE 
REAL TOP QUALITY ONES BECAUSE THEY 
WANT TO COME HERE BECAUSE OF THE 
MONEY I THINK IT IS ONLY GOING TO 
GET BETTER FOR THEM IT ISN'T THE 
MEANT TO BE 
DIFFERENT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE 
EXOTIC THAN THIS CERTAINLY THE 
NOVELTY OF CHELSEA FACING LIVERPOOL 
AT THIS STAGE EVERY SEASON IS JUST 
BEGINNING TO WEAR OFFER LITTLE I I AM SURE THE PLAYERS ARE NOW ARE AS 
BORED WITH IT AS SOME OF US ARE L. 
THINK LIVERPOOL WITH SHANKLY AND 
BOB PAISLEY AND THIS THAT A AND 
THE OTHER THEY WOULD BE TURNING 
OVER IN THEIR GRAVES NOW TO SEE 
THE EUROPEAN CUP FINAL LIVERPOOL 
AND MANCHESTER UNITED IN MOSCOW 
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE I AM NOT 
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW 
OTHER EUROPEAN LEAGUES ARE 
FUNCTIONING OR REACTING TO THE 
SUCCESS OF OUR CLUBS AT THE MOMENT 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO DOMINATE FOR 
EVER IT IS NOT WHAT FOOTBALL IS 
ABOUT IT WILL VARY 
HAS THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE BECOME LESS SPECIAL 
BY THE FACT THAT IT'S THE SAME FOUR 
TEAMS YOU'RE GETTING THE SAME 
TEAMS HERE IN YEAR OUT BUT HERE 
WE ARE TODAY LOOK AT IT PEOPLE 
DON'T WORRY THEY JUST WANT TO SEE 
THE BEST PLAYERS PLAYING FOR THEIR 
TEAM THAT'S WHY THEY COME HERE 
TIME AND 
TIME AGAIN L. AM SURE THAT 
WILL BE THE SAME IN THE CHAMPIONS' 
LEAGUE AS WELL 
DES KELLY I TAKE WHERE YOU ARE 
GOING WITH THIS BUT IF WE HAVE A 
LOOK AT THIS YEAR THE WINNERS BY 
NATION 
ENGLAND ONLY TWICE TO SPAIN'S FOUR 
IN THAT PERIOD SO IT WOULD SEEM 
THAT WE ARE NOT CONVERTING 
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT TABLE IN TEN 
YEARS' TIME IT WILL BE 
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT WE'RE NOT 
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S 
HAPPENED IN THE PAST WE ARE 
LOOKING AHEAD LOOKING AT THE FOUR 
FINALISTS FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS FOR THE 
FIRST TIME EVER ALL FOUR CLUBS 
FROM ENGLAND REACHED THE QUARTER 
FINALS THESE ARE NOT A BLIP THIS 
IS A TREND THIS WILL CONTINUE THE 
BEST PLAYERS ARE GOING TO COME HERE 
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A CLUB WHICH 
IS GOING TO GIVE YOU CHAMPIONS' 
LEAGUE SUCCESS YOU ARE LOOKING AT 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
WE HAVE NOT FOLLOWED IT THROUGH 
TWO OUT OF THE LAST SIXTEEN THEY ARE 
CROWING ABOUT 
HE IS NOT GOING TO 
COMPLAIN ABOUT BEING ACCUSED OF 
BEING TOO SUCCESSFUL 
HE IS CROWING 
ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF ENGLISH CLUBS 
IN EUROPE AND WE HAVE ONE TWO WHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT THERE 
IS THE TOP FOUR IN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE OF THE CYCLE OF FAREHAM 
THERE IS TALK OF IT BEING PASSED 
AROUND THE CONTINENT BUT I DO NOT 
THINK IT WILL HAPPEN WITH THE SAME 
REGULARITY THEY ARE PLAYING 
AMONGST THEMSELVES THAT MAKES THEM 
STRONGER AND STRONGER IN THE PAST 
PLAYERS LIKE TORRES RONALDO AND 
FABREGAS WOULD HAVE BEEN PLAYING 
FOR THE SPANISH GIANTS NOW THEY 
ARE HERE AND THAT WILL BECOME MORE 
PREVALENT 
WHAT ABOUT WHAT JOHN PREVALENT TOSHACK SAYS THIS IS GETTING QUITE 
BORING IT IS ALL GETTING A LITTLE 
BIT DULL AND NOBODY WANTS TO KEEP 
SEEING REPEATS OF THE SAME IT WILL 
ALWAYS BE THE SAME TOP FOUR TEAMS 
I WAS MYSTIFIED BY WHAT HE HAD TO 
SAVE OF COURSE WE ARE NOT BORED 
THE ENGLAND NATIONAL TEAM AT THE 
MOMENT IS RUBBISH TAKE 
PERVERSE KIND OF PRIDE THAT ENGLAND 
ARE DOMINATING THE SEMI FINALS 
ENGLISH CLUBS 
I GET A PERVERSE 
PRIDE THAT ENGLAND IS TERRIFYING 
THE REST OF EUROPE AT SOME LEVEL 
NOT AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL BUT AT 
CLUB LEVEL 
WE ARE RIGHT TO BE 
PROUD FERRAR RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE THERE ARE 
ENGLAND IS TERRIFYING THE REST OF 
EUROPE OR IS IT FOREIGN OWNERS 
MONEY THAT IS TERRIFYING THEM WE WE CAN HOPE THAT SOMEHOW THROUGH 
OSMOSIS AT THE ENGLISH NATIONAL 
TEAM WILL BECOME MORE POWERFUL MAN 
UTD WEEKEND THEMSELVES 
BUT THAT 
MADE THE PREMIERSHIP MORE 
INTERESTING 
WHEN LIVERPOOL PLAYED INTERESTING BIRMINGHAM THEY GOT A POINT DID 
THAT AFFECT OTHER TEAMS DOWN THE 
BOTTOM 
COMING UP WE GET A SNEAK BOTTOM PREVIEW OF LEWIS HAMILTON'S GOLF 
GAME DAVID CROFT JOINS THE FORMULA 
ONE COMMUNITY ON A GOLF DAY OUT 
THE A. T. P. MONTE CARLO MASTERS 
FINISHED YESTERDAY WITH RAFAEL 
NADAL TAKING THE CROWN 
BUT NOT 
BEFORE AUSTRALIAN OPEN CHAMPION 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC HAD MADE WAVES HE 
KNOCKED OUT ANDY MURRAY L. MET HIM 
TO TALK ABOUT TENNIS GENERALLY AND 
THE LONG WET DAYS AT WIMBLEDON 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC WHO WON HIS WAY TO 
THE TITLE OF AUSTRALIAN OPEN 
INFLICTED ON ROGER FEDERER HIS 
FIRST STRAIGHT SETS DEFEAT IN A 
GRAND SLAM EVENT OF OVER FOUR EARS 
HE IS POISED TO BREAK THE 
STRANGLEHOLD THAT RAFAEL NADAL AND 
ROGER FEDERER HAVE WON THE MEN'S 
GAME YOU ARE GOING FOR A CHECK UP 
ON YOUR SHOULDER SO WE WILL COME 
WITH YOU 
NO PROBLEM 
WE HAVE COME 
TO SEE YOUR WORLD 
THE WAY IT LOOKS 
LIKE HERE 
AT THE MOMENT I'M QUITE 
IMPRESSED HAVE YOUR FAMILY MOVED 
HERE 
YES THERE IN THE PROCESS L. L. HERE WAS ABOUT TO GO PROFESSIONAL IN 
SKIING THEN I DECIDED TO JUST PLAY 
TENNIS 
HOW OLD WERE YOU 
EIGHT OR TENNIS NINE 
WHAT MADE YOU SUDDENLY MADE NINE THAT DECISION 
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT 
TO DO ACTUALLY L. AM A BIG 
FOOTBALL FAN WHEREVER I GO LIKE 
MILAN I TRY TO GET TO SOME GAMES 
I HAVE A TENNIS COACH EVERY TIME 
MY HEEL I HAVE TO GO ON THE COURT 
THE NEXT DAY I HEAL IT 
WE NEED 
TO STABILISE THE SCAPULAR 
EVEN AT 
TWENTY YEARS OLD DJOKOVIC REALISES 
THAT TO KEEP UP WITH FEDERER AND 
NADAL HE MUST BE IN PEAK CONDITION 
AT EVERY TOURNAMENT REGULAR CHECK 
UPS ON THE SLIGHTEST PROBLEMS HAVE 
TO BE DONE AT THE START OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
THIRTEEN OF THE LAST FOURTEEN GRAND SLAM 
TOURNAMENTS HAVE BEEN WON BY ROGER 
FEDERER OR RAFAEL NADAL BUT THAT 
THIS YEAR'S AUSTRALIAN OPEN 
DJOKOVIC TURNED HIS POTENTIAL INTO 
SUCCESS BEATING WILFRED'S LONGER 
TO BECOME THE FIRST SERBIAN EVER TO 
WIN A GRAND SLAM TITLE WILFRED 
SANS D. A. 
THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY A LANDMARK 
MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE SOME MIGHT SAY 
A LANDMARK FOR ROGER FEDERER DID 
WE SEE THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF 
HIS DOMINANCE 
YOU DO NOT OFTEN SAY 
THIS BUT FEDERER LOOKS VULNERABLE 
I DO NOT THINK SO A LOT OF PEOPLE 
SAY THAT BUT IT IS JUST ONE 
TOURNAMENT AND IT IS THE START OF 
THE YEAR 
FEDERER HAS GONE 
OBVIOUSLY IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
HE WAS VERY DOMINANT 
NOT SINCE 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE HAS ROGER FEDERER LAST IN THE 
SEMI FINALS OF ANY TOURNAMENT HE HE DID NOT LOSE IN STRAIGHT SETS FOR 
MANY YEARS L. THINK THE FANS OF THE 
SPORT LIKE IT BECAUSE SOME NEW 
FACES ARE SHOWING UP 
WHAT A 
PERFORMANCE WHAT A MOMENT 
DJOKOVIC IN THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN 
FINAL 
WINNING A GRAND SLAM WAS MY FINAL GOAL FOR THIS YEAR 
YOU COULD HAVE 
PACKED UP IN JANUARY 
I COULD 
SETTLE HERE AND NOT PLAY ANY MORE 
TO ACHIEVE THAT DREAM THAT TWENTY YEARS 
OLD DO YOU HAVE TO KEEP RE 
EVALUATING YOUR GOALS EVERY TIME 
YES I AM A PERFECTIONIST I WANTED 
EVERYTHING TO BE RIGHT FOR ME L. 
ALWAYS AIMED FOR THE HIGHEST GOALS 
BY DOING THAT OBVIOUSLY I NEEDED 
TO HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN 
MYSELF 
YOU WERE JUST FOUR WHEN YOU MYSELF SAW THIS TENNIS COURT BEING BUILT 
ACROSS THE ROAD HOW MANY FOR YOUR 
ROLLS WOULD THINK THIS IS WHAT I 
WANT TO DO FOUR YEAR OLDS THAT THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WAS DESTINY I 
WAS MEANT TO PLAY TENNIS L. SAW 
THEM BUILDING THREE TENNIS COURTS 
I WENT AND TALKED TO THE WORKERS 
AND HELPED THEM OUT BRINGING THEM 
DRINKS FROM A RESTAURANT WHICH WE 
HAVE A NEAR BY THE COURTS THEY 
LIKED IT L. STARTED PLAYING I WAS 
VERY INTERESTED IN THAT AS A KID 
I WAS FULL OF ENERGY I WATCHED THE 
T. V. AND SAW SAMPRAS LIFTING THE 
WIMBLEDON TROPHY L. L. ASKED MY FATHER 
TO BUY ME A LITTLE RACKET AND HE 
DID I REMEMBER 
PLAYING ALL 
DAY 
WITH THE RACKET AND BALL AND I 
DEVELOPED MYSELF PART TIME IN 
SERBIA PART TIME IN GERMANY NOW 
TENNIS IS THE NUMBER ONE SPORT OF 
OUR COUNTRY IT IS VERY POPULAR 
KIDS BUYING RACKETS PLAYING 
TENNIS COURTS ARE SO BUSY 
UNFORTUNATELY STILL BUT NOT FOR 
OUR LONG TIME MORE WE DO NOT HAVE 
A LOT OF PROFESSIONAL FACILITIES 
AND CONDITIONS FOR THE YOUNG KIDS 
NOT FOR A LONG TIME SO A LOT OF 
THEM HAVE TO GO 
LIKE YOU DID L. I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS L. L. AM TRYING 
NOT JUST FOR MYSELF BUT FOR ALL THE 
OTHERS OF MEN'S AND WOMEN'S TENNIS 
IN SERBIA TRYING TO HELP OUT THOSE 
KIDS TO DEVELOP TO PRACTISE TO BE 
MOTIVATED AND JUST TO EXPLAIN TO 
THEM HOW IT IS 
DO YOU THINK IT IS 
AN EXCUSE TO SAY THERE ARE NOT 
ENOUGH FACILITIES 
HE MEAN IN 
SERBIA 
IN THE U. K. ANY COUNTRY THAT SERBIA SAYS IT IS ABOUT FACILITIES IS 
THAT AN EXCUSE 
I DO NOT KNOW IF I 
SHOULD SAY THE EXPRESSION SPOILED 
BUT I THINK IN THE U. K. A LOT OF 
KIDS AROUND LITTLE BIT SPOILED 
BECAUSE OF ALL THE CONDITIONS THEY 
HAVE RM LITTLE BIT SPOILED THEY 
DO NOT KNOW THE REAL MEANING OF THE 
TENNIS BUT THEY DO NOT WORK HARD 
ENOUGH IF YOU HAVE PERFECT 
CONDITIONS AND EVERYTHING YOU WANT 
YOU GET A LITTLE SPOILT AND THEN 
YOU DO NOT WANT TO WORK AS HARD 
THE HUNGER WAS NOT THERE 
SHE DO 
NOT HAVE THE HUNGER FOR SUCCESS 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING ON A 
PLATE YOU DO NOT HAVE 
YOU KNOW 
ANDY MURRAY VERY WELL IN THE LAST 
YEAR YOU HAVE GONE ONE WAY AND HE 
HAS GONE THE OTHER YOU WERE AROUND 
THE SAME LEVEL L. REMEMBER JOHN 
MCENROE IF YOU SING ABOUT THE TWO 
OF YOU YOU HAVE TO ACHIEVE YOUR 
GOALS TALKING ABOUT THE TWO OF 
YOUTH YOU HAVE ACHIEVED YOUR GOALS 
AT ONE MOMENT HE WAS DOING REALLY 
WELL THEN SUDDENLY HE GOT THIS 
INJURY HE STOPPED WORKING WITH 
BRAD GILBERT A LOT OF THINGS WERE 
GOING ON L. L. THINK HE NEEDS TO 
SETTLE DOWN MENTALLY AND JUST 
PLAYED TENNIS THINK HE HAS 
ENOUGH QUALITY TALENT AND 
POTENTIAL TO BE A TOP FIVE PLAYERS 
EVERYBODY EXPECTED HIM TO DO THAT 
TO BE A TOP FIVE PLAYER THERE IS 
SO MUCH PRESSURE ON HIM BECAUSE 
BRITAIN NEEDS CHAMPION BADLY THE WIMBLEDON CHAMPION ESPECIALLY I 
KNOW THAT 
WIMBLEDON IS VERY 
IMPORTANT TO YOU YES IT IS 
WIMBLEDON CHAMPION ESPECIALLY I KNOW 
IMPORTANT TO YOU YES IT IS FOR ME WIMBLEDON IS THE NUMBER ONE 
TOURNAMENT IN TENNIS IT JUST HAS 
THE BIGGEST TRADITION WHEN I WAS 
YOUNG I ALWAYS WATCHED WIMBLEDON 
I LIKED GRASS NOT MANY PLAYERS 
LIKE GRASS FOR ME IT IS A 
PLEASURE TO PLAY THERE 
I APART 
FROM THE RAIN 
TRUE THE RAIN 
ACCOUNT OF MRS. IT APART MRS. IT UP 
I HAD A VERY HARD TIME LAST YEAR 
THE RAIN GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO 
PRACTISE YOUR IMPERSONATIONS THEY THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY THING I DO WE DO 
A LOT OF THINGS IN THE LOCKER ROOM 
HE WILL NOT FIND OUT YOU WILL 
NOT FIND OUT IT IS A LOT OF FUN 
IN WIMBLEDON WE HAVE SO MUCH TIME 
BECAUSE OF THE RAIN 
IS THAT THE 
TIME YOU GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER 
NOT TOO CLOSE PREFERRED GIRLS 
YOU GET TO KNOW WHICH OTHER AS 
PEOPLE 
YES I AM JOKING WHAT PEOPLE WHAT ENCAPSULATES YOU 
I WANT EVERYTHING 
TO WORKOUT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY 
I THINK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH AND I 
HAVE THE DAMAGE ON MYSELF IT TAKES 
A LOT OF ENERGY TAKING CARE OF A 
LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT IS 
WHY I HAVE PEOPLE AROUND ME TO TAKE 
CARE OF THINGS OFF THE COURT IT 
PUTS SOME RELIEF ON ME SO I CAN 
FOCUS ON THE TENNIS AND WHAT I DO 
YOU HAVE STARTED THE YEAR IN THE 
BEST POSSIBLE WAY WHAT IS THE MOST 
REALISTIC OF THE THREE LEFT IF YOU 
ARE GOING TO WIN ONE MORE GRAND 
SLAM 
PROBABLY THE HARD COURT L. SLAM WOULD NOT COMPLAIN EVEN IF I WIN 
THE OTHER TWO ROLAND OR 
WIMBLEDON STILL I WANT THEIR 
STEP BY STEP 
THESE TENNIS PLAYERS STEP BY STEP ARE SO MATURE FOR THEIR AGE HE IS 
A FINE EXAMPLE BUT HE DID RETIRE 
AGAINST FEDERER IN THE SEMI FINAL 
HE HAS DONE IT A COUPLE OF TIMES 
BEFORE SOMETIMES THROUGH INJURY 
AND ILLNESS ANY REPUTATION 
DEVELOPING THEIR 
THE LATEST ONE 
WAS A SORE THROAT HE IS A FINE ONE 
TO SAY TENNIS PLAYERS ARE SPOILED 
HE WENT OFF THE COT 
BUT HE IS 
LOOKING AFTER HIMSELF 
AT THE SAME 
TIME HE DID BEAT FEDERER IN 
STRAIGHT SETS FOOT STOP THEN HE 
BEAT SOMEONE AND SEEDED IN THE 
FINAL HE BEAT FEDERER IN 
STRAIGHT SETS THEN HE BEAT 
SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT SEEDED HE SAYS 
BRITISH PLAYERS ARE SPOILED ARE 
THE LATEST STATEMENT IN BRITAIN 
GETS THEM TO PLAY IN TRACKSUITS 
WITH D. J.'S AND SAYS THEY SHOULD MOVE 
AWAY FROM HITTING THE BALL OVER THE 
NET IT SOUNDS MAD BUT IT IS TRUE 
HE HAS DONE EVERYTHING AT A 
RIDICULOUSLY YOUNG AGE HIS HIS IMPRESSIONS KEEP HIM BUSY IN THE 
LOCKER ROOM AND THAT IS ALL LOOK 
AT THIS IMPRESSION AND TELL ME 
YOU'VE GOT G. MACKEY THINK IT IS 
WHO YOU THINK IT IS 
I HOPE IT IS 
NOT A FEMALE TENNIS PLAYER LONG 
SHORTS AND A LOT OF ADJUSTING 
IT 
IT IS RAFAEL NADAL IT IS NOT A BAD 
IMPERSONATION THESE ARE FROM THE 
STELLA ARTOIS 
I THOUGHT THIS ONE 
WAS NORMAN WISDOM THIS COULD BE 
FEMALE 
IS THAT IT 
IT WAS FEMALE 
MARIA SHARAPOVA OR BUT NOT 
EVERYBODY HAS ENJOYED BEING 
IMPERSONATED 
ROGER FEDERER WAS IMPERSONATED VERY UPSET AND SAID HE WAS WALKING 
A TIGHTROPE HE GETS UPSET BY A 
CONFIDENT YOUNG UPSTART HE'S THE 
GUY THAT CAN CHALLENGE NADAL AND 
FEDERER 
IT GOES BACK TO THE DAYS OF ILIE 
NASTASE AND JIMMY CONNORS IF YOU 
GET A TENNIS PLAYER WITH A 
PERSONALITY IT'S GREAT BECAUSE 
THERE ARE TOO MANY ROBOTS ON THE 
CIRCUIT 
THE A. T. P. ARE TRYING TO CIRCUIT DEVELOP THE NEXT TIER AND HE IS 
DOING THE JOB FOR THEM 
AT LONG LAST THIS FORMULA ONE 
SEASON THE BRITISH HAVE SOMETHING 
TO SMILE ABOUT HAMILTON GOT HIS 
FEET ON THE PODIUM AND BUTTON 
FINALLY GOT SOME POINTS DAVID 
CROFT TAGGED ALONG ON RARE DAY'S 
R. AND AMP R. WITH THE DRIVERS AS THEY 
CELEBRATED RUBENS BARRICHELLO'S 
RECORD BREAKING CAREER AS USUAL 
THE TALK IN THE CLUBHOUSE WAS OF 
MORE THAN GOLF 
RUBENS BARRICHELLO WILL BECOME THE 
MOST EXPERIENCED GRAND PRIX DRIVER 
OF ALL TIME IN TURKEY IT WILL BE 
HIS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SEVENTH GRAND PRIX TO CELEBRATE 
HE HAS DECIDED TO SWAP A BIT OF 
DRIVING BEHIND THE WHEEL FOR SOME 
DRIVING ON THE GOLF COURSE HE HAS 
INVITED SOME FRIENDS ALONG TO 
CELEBRATE CELEBRATE A FANTASTIC MAN FOR THE TEAM GREAT 
GUY FOR MECHANICS JUST FOR 
EVERYBODY 
I HONESTLY NEVER NEVER EVERYBODY THOUGHT I MEAN UNTIL LAST YEAR 
WHEN I RESIGNED THE CONTRACT WITH 
HONDA AND IT WAS THEN THAT I 
REALISED O. K. I MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE 
TO BEAT THE RECORD FOR ME IT IS 
SUCH A PROUD MOMENT TO BE HERE NOW 
AND TO BE COMPETITIVE MORE THAN 
ANYTHING ELSE L. HAVE NOT ACHIEVED 
EVERYTHING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MY 
AIM IS TO BE WORLD CHAMPION BUT 
YOU KNOW IF I HAD TO STOP NOW I 
AM A PRETTY HAPPY MAN 
AND IT WILL BE ANOTHER 
RACE VICTORY FOR KIMI RAIKKONEN AND 
FOR FERRARI WHO WIN THE SPANISH 
GRAND PRIX 
HAVE FERRARI GOT AN ADVANTAGE 
A I 
THINK SO I THINK MELBOURNE WAS AN 
ANOMALY THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED 
SINCE THEN THAT THEY ARE FAIRLY 
DOMINANT AT THE MOMENT 
THEY SEEM 
TO HAVE A CAR FOR ALL SITUATIONS SO 
FAR MCLAREN OBVIOUSLY HAD A BAD 
WEEKEND IN SPAIN THE CAR WAS QUICK 
BUT IT TAKES A BIT OF SETTING UP 
IT WAS ON A KNIFE EDGE SO FERRARI 
ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING THE 
STRONGEST AT THE MOMENT 
I DO NOT 
THINK IT IS IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE 
CHALLENGED 
IF WE COULD JUST TALK CHALLENGED ABOUT THE EXCITEMENT ON THE TRACK 
BUT NO POLITICS ARE DOMINATING THE 
AGENDA ONCE AGAIN CONCERNING THE 
F. I. A. PRESIDENT MAX MOSLEY HE 
STANDS DEFIANT WHILST ALL WENT IN 
PEOPLE ARE CALLING FOR HIM TO STAND 
DOWN 
THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED DOWN MORALITY AND THAT IS WHERE THE 
STANDARDS ARE SET FOR ANY 
CORPORATION AND IF THEY ARE 
OUTSIDE THE STANDARDS SET WITHIN 
THAT COMPANY MULTINATIONAL OR 
PUBLIC COMPANY THEN ALL OF THEIR 
EMPLOYEES HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT 
KNOWLEDGE THEREFORE I'M AFRAID 
THEY ARE GOING TO SAY THIS 
UNACCEPTABLE FOR US COMMERCIALLY 
TO REMAIN IN THIS POSITION WITH A 
PRESIDENT WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE 
MEETING HEADS OF STATE HEADS OF 
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS WHETHER 
IT BE IN THE CAR INDUSTRY WHICH 
THEY CONTROL WHETHER IT BE THE 
MOTOR CLUBS THAT THEY ALSO CONTROL 
AS WELL AS MOTOR SPORT SO I REALLY 
DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE FOR MAX 
MOSLEY TO STAY 
IN BARCELONA THE 
TEAM BOSSES GOT TOGETHER WITH 
BERNIE ECCLESTON FOR A DISCUSSION 
MOSLEY HERE WAS A CHANCE 
FOR A PUBLIC STATEMENT TO BE MADE 
AS TO WHETHER THOSE THAT RUN THE 
FORMULA ONE TEAMS BELIEVE THE 
PRESIDENT SHOULD STEP DOWN BUT NO 
PUBLIC STATEMENT WAS FORTHCOMING 
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO UNANIMOUS 
AGREEMENT UNTIL THE TEAMS DECIDE 
UNANIMOUSLY WHETHER HE SHOULD STAY 
OR GO THERE WILL BE NO STATEMENT 
THERE WILL BE NO MESSAGE FROM 
FORMULA ONE AS TO WHAT SHOULD 
HAPPEN TO MAX MOSLEY IN THE FUTURE 
SO FOR NO LET'S PUT THE POLITICS 
ON HOLD WE GET BACK TO THE RACING 
IN TURKEY WHICH FAVOURS FERRARI 
SO THEY CAN STRETCH THEIR LEAD IN 
BOTH CHAMPIONSHIPS LEWIS HAMILTON 
HAS IT ALL TO DO ON THE GOLF 
COURSE HE'S GOT QUITE A BIT TO DO 
AS WELL BELIEVE ME I'VE BEEN 
WATCHING HIM PLAY 
THAT'S REASSURING TO KNOW HE IS 
NOT GOOD AT EVERYTHING FIRST OF 
ALL MAX MOSLEY IT WOULD APPEAR 
SUPPORT IS EBBING AWAY EVERY DAY 
AND WHO IF ANYBODY IS GOING TO 
STAND UP FOR HIM COME JUNE TWENTY SECOND IS 
IT WHEN 
HE IS IN AN 
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT POSITION 
ALREADY THE TEAMS ARE SAYING THEY 
WANT 
HIM OUT 
PRETTY MUCH L. THINK 
CRUCIALLY NOW SOME OF THE SPONSORS 
ARE STARTING TO ASK SERIOUS 
QUESTIONS THAT IS WHEN BERNIE 
ECCLESTONE ALTHOUGH IT IS HIS MATE 
IT IS THE WHOLE FUTURE OF FORMULA 
ONE BECAUSE IT IS OVERSHADOWING 
EVERYTHING 
SIGNIFICANTLY BERNIE EVERYTHING ORIGINALLY SUPPORTED MAX MOSLEY 
PUBLICLY BUT SINCE THEN IT HAS 
BEEN A LONG SILENCE BECAUSE OF THE 
LURID STORIES HIS CREDIBILITY IS 
GONE 
LEWIS HAMILTON ON THE PODIUM GONE FINALLY IT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH 
SEASON FOR HIM ISN'T IT A GOOD 
LEARNING CURVE 
LAST YEAR THE 
NOVELTY ASPECT THE HONEYMOON 
PERIOD BUT THIS SEASON HE IS THE 
TEAM LEADER IT'S HIS JOB TO GIVE 
FEEDBACK TO THE ENGINEERS THERE IS 
NO COACHES IN FORMULA ONE HE IS 
ESSENTIALLY THERE TO TELL THE TEAM 
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CAR THAT'S 
WHY PROST AND SCHUMACHER WERE SO 
GREAT THEIR EXPERIENCE COUNTS FOR 
A LOT THIS WILL COME WITH TIME AND 
EXPERIENCE HE'S GOING TO MAKE 
MISTAKES BUT HE HAS GOT ALL THE 
TALENT 
THE FASTEST MAN IN RUGBY LEAGUE 
CONTROVERSIAL SPRINTER DWAIN 
CHAMBERS WAS IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
AGAIN YESTERDAY WHEN HE MADE HIS 
DEBUT IN A RESERVE FRIENDLY AGAINST 
YORK CITY KNIGHTS THERE WERE A LOT 
OF CURIOUS SPECTATORS THERE NOT 
LEAST HIS NEW EMPLOYERS CASTLEFORD 
TIGERS MATTHEW PINSENT'S BEEN ON 
THE DWAIN TRAIL FIRST THERE WAS THIS 
THEN THERE WAS THIS 
DWAIN CHAMBERS HAS 
TESTED POSITIVE 
SO HE TURNED HIS 
ATTENTION TO THIS THEN 
CONTROVERSIALLY RETURNED TO 
ATHLETICS ON THE TRACK AND NO 
HE IS TRYING HIS HAND AT THIS 
WITH HIS FOUR WEEK TRIAL AT 
CASTLEFORD COMING TO AN END THIS 
SPECIALLY ARRANGED FRIENDLY WAS HIS 
CHANCE TO PROVE HIMSELF THE TIGERS 
FANS CAME IN THEIR DROVES THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED 
PEOPLE QUEUED AROUND THE BLOCK 
KICK OFF WAS DELAYED BY FIFTEEN MINUTES 
AND THE MEDIA WERE JUST AS 
INTERESTED AFTER TEN MINUTES ON THE 
BENCH DWAIN CHAMBERS WILL MAKE HIS 
DEBUT IN RUGBY LEAGUE FOR 
CASTLEFORD TIGERS L. WAS VERY 
JITTERY JUST BEFORE GOING ON SO 
MUCH PRESSURE ON ME AND JUST ON ME 
ONLY IT WAS TOUGH HURTING WENHAM 
NOT USED TO BEING BANGED UP IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT HAVE GOT TO GET USED 
TO I HAVE GOT TO GET USED TO AS 
YOU COULD SEE I WAS OUT OF GAS 
EVERY TEN SECONDS AS THE GAME WENT 
ON I GOT MORE STUCK IN THERE WAS 
A FEW TACKLES THAT LEFT MY HEAD'S 
SPINNING A BIT IT'S A VERY 
PHYSICAL SPORT YOU CAN'T THINK 
ABOUT THESE THINGS YOU JUST HAVE 
TO GO INTO IT WITH ALL YOUR HEART 
A CRUNCHING TACKLE IN THE FINAL 
MINUTES FORCED HIM OFF BUT THE 
CLUB SAYS HIS SHOULDER INJURY IS 
NOT SERIOUS AS FOR THE FANS THEIR 
VERDICT WAS UNEQUIVOCAL THEY LOVED 
HIM BUT WILL HE BE PLEASING AND 
OLYMPIC CROWD THIS SUMMER THE 
BRITISH OLYMPIC ASSOCIATION 
CONFIRMED TODAY THEY HAVE HAD NO 
CONTACT FROM CHAMBERS OR HIS 
LAWYERS REGARDING A POSSIBLE APPEAL 
DWAIN WAS NOT FIELDING ANY 
QUESTIONS ON THAT FRONT ON HIS 
RUGBY LEAGUE FUTURE CASTLEFORD 
HOPE TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT LATER 
THIS WEEK AS EVER WITH DWAIN 
THEE ARE MORE QUESTIONS THAN 
THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS HOWEVER BOTH THE CLUB AND 
DWAIN INSIST THE PAST MONTH HAS 
BEEN ABOUT MORE THAN JUST COURTING 
PUBLICITY TO BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT 
WHERE I FEEL HAPPY AND RUGBY 
LEAGUE HAS MADE ME FEEL HAPPY AND 
I HAVE GOT THE BEST OUT OF MYSELF 
THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME AND 
GO AND REDEEM MYSELF AS AN 
INDIVIDUAL AND RAISED NO CONFIDENCE 
TO GO AND RAISED MY CONFIDENCE 
THERE WAS A LOT OF CYNICISM IN THIS 
STUDIO RAISED IT THERE STILL 
IS RAISE HE HAS NOW PUT HIMSELF 
IN THE LINE OF FIRE ALBEIT IN A 
RESERVE MATCH IS HE GENUINELY 
THINKING ABOUT THIS AS A CAREER HE HE IS THE FIRST RUGBY LEAGUE STAR I 
HAVE EVER SEEN WHO HAS CURTSIED ON 
THE PITCH FOR A START 
I A GOOD 
CROWD I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE 
TURNED UP IF SYD LITTLE WAS PLAIN 
I THINK HIS NEXT JOB MIGHT BE 
GLADIATORS OR PANTO 
A THING WE CAN 
GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR HAVING A GO L. 
WAS ALSO A CYNICAL BUT IT WAS A 
GOOD CROWD FOR A CELEBRITY TURN HE 
DID O. K. APPARENTLY HE WAS GASPING 
FOR STAMINA A FEW EYE CATCHING 
TACKLES IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MEAN 
ANYTHING OR IT HAS DONE IS BOOSTED 
DWAIN'S PROFILE GOOD LUCK TO HIM 
WHERE WILL WE SEE HIM NEXT PUNTER PUNTER I WOULD SAY MAYBE THE BOBSLEIGH 
TEAM 
O. K. NOW THE BACK PAGES TEAM PANTO FERGIE IS UP FOR A SCRAP 
SAYS THIS ONE ALSO WEST BROM WHO 
WERE PRETTY MUCH INTO THE 
PREMIERSHIP ONE NEXT SEASON COLE 
HAVE GOT TO WIN BY TWELVE GOALS AND AND WEST BROM ARE PRETTY WELL EQUIPPED 
MUCH MORE SO THAN DERBY THEY PLAY 
GOOD FOOTBALL THEY ARE NOT YOUR 
TYPICAL CHAMPIONSHIP SIDE THEY'VE 
GOT A CHANCE 
AND SVEN ON THE BACK 
PAGE OF THE DAILY EXPRESS SAYING 
I AM FINISHED CITY IS OVER FOR ME 
ME HE TELLS HIS FRIENDS AT THE 
END OF THE SEASON APPARENTLY HE 
WILL WALK AWAY IS THIS ABOUT 
FROZEN FUNDS 
THERE IS A QUOTE 
IN THERE WHERE HE SAYS THAT THE 
FUNDS ARE FROZEN AS HE JUMPED OR 
EASY BEING PUSHED 
I WOULD SAY IT 
IS A MIRROR IMAGE OF HIS ENGLAND 
CAREER STARTED OFF IN A BLAZE OF 
GLORY AND SUDDENLY IT PETERS OUT 
INTO INDIFFERENCE THERE IS MORE TO 
IT THAN JUST SVEN WALKING AWAY I 
THINK YOU MAY HAVE FOUND THAT 
SHINAWATRA HAS PUSHED HIM BUT WHO 
ARE YOU GOING TO GET TO TAKE OVER 
AT MANCHESTER CITY L. THINK HE IS 
SMART ENOUGH TO BRING SUCCESS WILL WILL HE TURN UP SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE 
IF PEOPLE CAN GET 
HIM IN FOR A YEAR AND GIVE HIM FIVE 
MILLION TO GO AWAY HE WILL TURN UP 
ANYWHERE 
I THINK HE HAS FADED AWAY ANYWHERE BUT 
YOU BELIEVE HE IS GOOD THANK THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR COMPANY DON'T 
FORGET THE WOMEN'S F. A. CUP FINAL ON 
MONDAY FEATURING A ARSENAL AND 
LEEDS UNITED AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY ON B. B. C. ONE

GOOD NIGHT
