FIRST TO AMERICA AND A LOT OF 
MESS AFTER A VERY BIG STORM 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WERE HURT AND 
THOUSANDS OF HOMES FROM DAMAGED 
WHEN A TORNADO SWEPT THROUGH PARTS 
OF THE COUNTRY 
IT'S ALL BEEN HAPPENING IN THE 
SOUTHERN STATES OF OKLAHOMA AND 
TEXAS 
IT LOOKS LIKE A REALLY BAD CRASH 
BUT ALL OF THIS WAS CAUSED BY THE 
WEATHER WEATHER WHEN THE TORNADO HIT THIS PART OF 
THE UNITED STATES THESE CARS WERE 
PICKED UP AND THROWN AROUND LIKE 
TOYS TOYS THESE HOUSES DIDN'T DO MUCH BETTER 
EITHER EITHER OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS IT SEEMS 
LIKE LOADS OF US HAVE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT OUR STRANGE WEATHER ONE 
MINUTE IT'S REALLY HOT AND TIME FOR 
SUNGLASSES THE NEXT MINUTE IT'S SO 
COLD YOU HAVE TO PUT A HAT BACK ON 
AGAIN AGAIN WHILE THAT SEEMS STRANGE IT'S 
PRETTY NORMAL FOR APRIL IT'S THE 
SAME IN AMERICA AS THEIR SEASONS 
CHANGE THEY GET ODD WEATHER TOO 
IT'S JUST THEIRS IS MORE DRAMATIC 
THAN OURS 
TORNADOES ARE FAST AND THEY'RE 
STRONG THEY DON'T CARE WHO THEY 
HIT THEY MOVE ACROSS THESE HUGE 
FLAT PARTS OF AMERICA LIKE A 
MASSIVE VACUUM CLEANER SUCKING UP 
ANYTHING IN THEIR PATH AND SPITTING 
IT OUT AGAIN 
A TORNADO ON THE GROUND 
THIS MAN 
KNEW WHAT WAS COMING 
HE WAS QUICK TO GET OFF THE PHONE 
AND OUT OF THE WAY 
BUT NOT EVERYONE WAS AS LUCKY 
A TREE BRANCH HIT MY CAR AND PICKED 
ME UP FOOT OFF THE GROUND AND 
SLAMMED ME DOWN INTO THE ROAD 
FACING THE OTHER WAY 
I LOOKED OUT 
OF THE BACK PORCH L. SAW ALL KINDS OF DEBRIS FLYING AROUND L. THOUGHT 
IT WAS A TORNADO BECAUSE IT GOT 
REAL QUIET IT SOUNDED LIKE A TRAIN 
WAS COMING THROUGH THERE THEN THE THE STORMY SEASON HERE CAN LAST UNTIL 
JULY UNTIL THEN PEOPLE WILL BE 
TRYING TO STAY SAFE AND OUT OF THE 
WAY OF THE TORNADOS

WHAT IS YOUR COUNTING LIKE BIRD 
EXPERTS IN NORTHUMBERLAND HAVE 
QUITE A TASK ON THEIR HANDS THEIR 
JOB IS TO COUNT PUFFINS ON THE 
FARNE ISLANDS IN NORTHUMBERLAND 
IT'S NOT AS EASY AS IT MIGHT SOUND 
WHEN IT COMES TO BIRDS PUFFINS 
REALLY STAND OUT THEY HAVE 
COLOURFUL BEAKS AND THEY CAN STRUT 
THEIR STUFF 
DOING A HEAD COUNT SHOULD BE PRETTY 
EASY EASY BUT ON THE FARNE ISLANDS OFF THE 
COAST OF NORTHUMBERLAND THERE ARE 
TENS OF THOUSANDS TO GO ON THE 
REGISTER THEY DON'T SIT STILL FOR 
VERY LONG IT DOESN'T HELP THAT 
SOME OF THEM LIVE UNDERGROUND 
WE WILL RING A SMALL NUMBER OF 
BIRDS DURING THE COURSE OF THIS 
SEASON THIS WILL BRING THEM OUT 
AND CHECK THEIR BODY WEIGHT AND 
BODY MASS 
BECAUSE THEY ATTRACT LOTS OF 
VISITORS BIRD EXPERTS LIKE TO KEEP 
AN EYE ON PUFFIN POPULATION SO THEY 
COUNT HOW MANY LIVE ON THE ISLANDS

GONE UP BUT EVERYONE IS EAGER TO 
SEE THIS BATCH OF RESULTS BECAUSE

CONTAINING EGGS OR LIVE CHECKS 
THE PUFFIN POPULATION IS BEING 
COUNTED WE CAN SEE AFTER FIVE 
YEARS IF THEY'RE DOING WELL OR BAD
