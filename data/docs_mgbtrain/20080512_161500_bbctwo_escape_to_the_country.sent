BUT NOT TODAY'S FAMILY THEY'RE MOVING OUT OF TOWN 
TO BE NEARER TO WORK AND THEY'LL PROBABLY END UP WITH A SMALLER HOUSE TO BOOT 
HOVE ON THE SOUTH COAST OF EAST SUSSEX SHARES A LOT WITH ITS MORE VIBRANT NOISY NEIGHBOUR BRIGHTON 
ELEGANT REGENCY AND VICTORIAN TOWNHOUSES AND MILES OF FANTASTIC BEACH FRONT 
BUT WHERE HOVE TENDS TO BE RESIDENTIAL BRIGHTON IS ONE OF THE U. K.'S PARTY CAPITALS 
CATERING FOR WEEKENDERS AND HOLIDAY MAKERS WHO ENJOY THE CITY'S PIER BARS AND CLUBS ALL YEAR ROUND 
THE BOHEMIAN LANES DISTRICT 
AT THE HEART OF BRIGHTON AND HOVE IS THE OLDEST PART OF THE CITY 
ONCE HOME TO MONKS SMUGGLERS AND FISHERMEN 
IT NOW ATTRACTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF VISITORS EVERY YEAR 
ALL KEEN TO SOAK UP ITS INDIVIDUAL AND ALTERNATIVE MOOD 
IT'S LAID BACK ATMOSPHERE AND PROXIMITY TO LONDON 
ATTRACTS MANY AFFLUENT CITY WORKERS TO SET UP HOME HERE EARNING IT THE NICKNAME LONDON BY SEA 
WHILE MANY ASPIRE TO MOVE DOWN TO BRIGHTON AND HOVE TRACEY AND TARIQ ARE TURNING THEIR BACKS ON THE SEA 
AND HEADING INLAND IN SEARCH OF THAT ELUSIVE COUNTRY LIFESTYLE 
AFTER NINE YEARS IN HOVE TRACEY FEELS CRAMPED BY HER TOWN SIZED GARDEN 
AND ASPIRES TO SOMETHING MUCH MORE SELF SUFFICIENT 
HER VERY OWN PIECE OF THE GOOD LIFE 
AT THE MOMENT I ONLY HAVE THIS SMALL PLOT HERE BY THE WASHING LINE 
BASICALLY I'D LIKE A LARGE PLOT WHERE I COULD PUT A BIG GREENHOUSE DO MY OWN SEEDS AND MY OWN PLANTING 
AND HOPEFULLY FILL UP THE CUPBOARDS WITH MY OWN PRODUCE INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN THE SUPERMARKET 
MEANWHILE SEVEN YEAR OLD SON HANNY FINDS CITY LIFE IS CRAMPING HIS STYLE 
HE LONGS FOR A LARGE GARDEN FOR ENTIRELY DIFFERENT REASONS 
I'M LEARNING TO RIDE MY BIKE AND I NEED SOMEWHERE SAFE TO RIDE IT 
COME ON START PEDALLING PEDAL PEDAL PEDAL PEDAL PEDAL PEDAL 
AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S QUITE A BUSY ROAD WE LIVE ON 
IT'S NOT VERY SAFE FOR HANNY TO RIDE HIS BIKE ON 
A LARGE PRIVATE SPACE WOULD BE FANTASTIC 
TRACEY AND TARIQ BOUGHT THEIR HOUSE NINE YEARS AGO FOR TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
BACK THEN IT WAS A FOUR BED FOUR BATHROOM GUEST HOUSE 
WHICH THEY HAVE SINCE CONVERTED BACK INTO A ROOMY FAMILY HOME 
ENTERING VIA THE BASEMENT THERE'S A UTILITY ROOM 
ALONGSIDE A CHILDREN'S PLAYROOM AND THE SPACIOUS KITCHEN DINER 
UP TO THE GROUND FLOOR THERE'S A SMALL STUDY OPPOSITE THE LARGE FORMAL DINING ROOM 
AT THE FRONT OF THE PROPERTY IS A SPACIOUS FAMILY SITTING ROOM 
ANOTHER FLIGHT OF STAIRS LEADS TO THE FIRST FLOOR 
ON THE RIGHT IS A GENEROUS DOUBLE BEDROOM WITH EN SUITE BATHROOM 
TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY ARE TWO MORE LARGE DOUBLE BEDROOMS 
UP YET MORE STAIRS IS A SINGLE GUEST BEDROOM 
NEXT TO ANOTHER DOUBLE WITH YET ANOTHER EN SUITE BATHROOM 
ALONG THE HALLWAY TO THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
WITH A HUGE WALK IN WARDROBE AND A FAMILY SIZE EN SUITE 
SO TRACEY AND TARIQ I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS TO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR PROPERTY HERE 
YEAH WE HAVE SOLD THE PROPERTY OR WE HOPE TO 
WHAT DID YOU GET FOR IT IN THE END 
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
CONGRATULATIONS THAT'S SPOT ON ASKING PRICE 
YES HOW MUCH DID YOU MAKE 
WE DID BUY TEN YEARS AGO FOR TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
SO HALF A MILLION BASICALLY 
YES WELL DONE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR ME IS HOW MUCH YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IN YOUR NEXT PROPERTY 
I WOULD SAY IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MARK WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO MOVE TO 
FURTHER INLAND FROM HERE IN SUSSEX OR SURREY 
SIMPLY BECAUSE I NEED TO BE CLOSER TO WORK 
THE HOUSE ITSELF WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT IT 
MINIMUM THREE OR FOUR BEDROOMS WITH THE POSSIBILITY TO EXTEND TO FIVE OR SIX 
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO ESCAPE RIGHT OUT TO THE COUNTRY AND HAVE LOADS OF SPACE AROUND YOU 
OR WOULD YOU PREFER TO BE MORE IN TOUCH WITH THE COMMUNITY 
MORE IN TOUCH WITH THE COMMUNITY DEFINITELY THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU HAVE A VERY HEALTHY BUDGET 
THE SLIGHTLY BAD NEWS IS THAT A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE LOOKING IN SURREY HAVE HEALTHY BUDGETS 
YOU HAVE TO BE QUITE FEISTY AND BE PREPARED TO BE QUITE COMPETITIVE ABOUT ANYTHING I FIND 
YOU'RE IN AN EXTREMELY GOOD POSITION BECAUSE YOU'RE UNDER OFFER 
YOU'RE TEMPTING AS BUYERS 
I'LL SEND YOU BACK PICTURES OF THE PROPERTIES AND HOPEFULLY ONE WILL BE THE PROPERTY OF YOUR DREAMS 
LOVELY THANK YOU FANTASTIC I'M QUITE EXCITED ABOUT THIS 
TARIQ AND TRACEY HAVE A REALLY GOOD BUDGET AND ARE QUITE FLEXIBLE ABOUT THE SORT OF PROPERTY THEY WANT 
MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT BIG FAMILY HOMES RIPE FOR RENOVATION DON'T COME UP THAT OFTEN 
AND THOSE THAT DO ARE OFTEN SNAPPED UP BY DEVELOPERS 
SO I HAVE A HEALTHY BUDGET OF SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
TO FIND TRACEY AND TARIQ A NEW HOME IN THE SURREY SUSSEX BORDERS 
INITIALLY AFTER A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE THE PROPERTY MUST HAVE 
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT TO EXTEND TO FIVE OR SIX 
BONUSES WOULD INCLUDE A LIVELY COMMUNITY 
WITH AMENITIES CLOSE TO HAND 
THE FOCUS OF MY SEARCH IS THE SURREY SLASH WEST SUSSEX BORDERS 
THIS AREA'S CONVENIENT PROXIMITY TO LONDON AND EXCELLENT TRANSPORT LINKS 
MEANS IT'S HOME OF CHOICE FOR MANY OF THE CAPITAL'S WEALTHY COMMUTERS 
BUT AWAY FROM ITS BUSY THOROUGHFARES THE AREA HAS MANAGED TO PRESERVE MUCH OF ITS RURAL CHARM 
AND IS ONE OF THE MOST DENSELY WOODED PARTS OF ENGLAND 
MY SEARCH BEGINS IN THE HAMLET OF TOWER HILL ESSENTIALLY JUST A CLUSTER OF HOUSES AND A PUB 
MY FIRST PROPERTY IS A FOUR BEDROOM EDWARDIAN HOUSE WITH OUTBUILDINGS AND AN ANNEX 
IT'S CLOSE TO GOOD ROAD LINKS WHICH SHOULD SUIT TARIQ AND IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
BACK IN BRIGHTON THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE OF PLAN 
TARIQ HAS BEEN CALLED AWAY ON URGENT BUSINESS FOR A WEEK SO TRACEY HAS CALLED IN FAMILY FRIEND LISA 
TO ACT AS HIS EARS AND EYES DURING MY SEARCH 
MIKE HELLO HELLO CATHY 
NICE TO SEE YOU WE COME INTO THIS LOVELY BIG SPACE HERE BUT SHALL WE DO THE HOUSE IN ORDER 
START AT THE FRONT HERE AND GO INTO THIS ROOM FIRST 
YOU'LL BE DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT THE HOUSE IS THE RIGHT ERA FOR MY COUPLE 
SO DADO RAIL IS VERY IN KEEPING 
AND THE HEIGHT OF THE CEILINGS 
IT ALL LOOKS VERY LIVEABLE SO WELL THE FRONT ROOM DOES ANYWAY 
SO THEY'VE PUT IN PLASTIC FRAMED WINDOWS 
IF YOU LOVE THEM YOU'RE THINKING THAT'S ONE LESS JOB TO DO 
IF YOU'RE THINKING WE'D LIKE AUTHENTIC LOOKING WINDOWS 
THAT'S ANOTHER JOB TO DO SO IT'S SORT OF 
AGAIN THAT'S NOT AUTHENTIC 
SO TARIQ AND TRACEY NEED TO BE THINKING WOULD WE CHANGE IT OR LEAVE IT AS IT IS 
THIS IS INTRIGUING IT LOOKS LIKE A SOOTHSAYER'S CABIN OR SOMETHING 
BEHIND THERE IS THE BOILER 
OH RIGHT O. K. BOILER BEHIND THE CURTAINS 
ANYWAY LET'S CARRY ON AND HAVE A LOOK AT THAT LOVELY BIG KITCHEN 
THAT'S NOT A BAD SIZED ROOM NO OBVIOUSLY JUST MOVE THE BOILER IT'S NOT A MAJOR PROBLEM IS IT 
LOVELY BIG ROOM HERE 
SO PRESUMABLY AT SOME STAGE THIS HAS BEEN MASSIVELY KNOCKED ABOUT TO CREATE THIS SURE 
THIS IS THE KITCHEN PROPER UP THIS END 
I THINK MY FAMILY WILL REALLY LIKE THIS THEY LIKE BIG OPEN SPACES 
IT'S LOVELY YOU CAN LIVE IN IT 
NO PROBLEM UNTIL YOU WANT DO IT YOURSELF OR DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH IT 
WHEN WAS THIS CONSERVATORY ADDED THIS WAS ADDED BY THE CURRENT OWNERS 
THEY'RE REALLY EXTENDED THE LIVING SPACE BRILLIANTLY 
IT'S EXCELLENT 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE AND IT'S OFF THE KITCHEN SO IT'S A GOOD LIVE IN FAMILY AREA ISN'T IT 
IF WE WANDER DOWN THIS WAY THIS MUST BE YOUR BIGGER SITTING ROOM 
OH RIGHT THIS IS MORE THE STYLE 
YOU HAVE THE LARGER ROOM 
THAT IS A LOVELY SIZE ISN'T IT IT IS A LOVELY SIZE 
THE THING I LIKE ABOUT THE ROOM IS IT HAS A LOT OF LIGHT COS YOU HAVE THE WINDOW THERE 
BUT ALSO THE DOORS OPENING OUT INTO THE GARDEN IT HAS A SOUTHERLY ASPECT OUT WE COME 
IS ALL THE GARDEN TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE THAT'S RIGHT 
THE MAJORITY OF IT IS TO THE BACK THAT'S LOVELY 
I'M VERY INTRIGUED BY WHAT'S IN THIS SWISH CHALET AT THE END OF THE GARDEN 
WE HAVE A SAUNA AND A SPA 
A SAUNA AND SPA MY GOODNESS ME TRACEY AND TARIQ DIDN'T ASK ME FOR ONE OF THOSE BUT A BIG BONUS 
OH GOSH I SEE THAT'S ALL BEING INCLUDED IN THE PRICE OF THE HOUSE 
THAT'S CORRECT I SHALL RESIST THE URGE TO GO IN THERE NOW 
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE BEDROOMS 
IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S NOT THE SORT OF THING WE USE I'VE NEVER HAD A SAUNA IN MY LIFE 
THERE ARE SOME BIG BONUSES OUTSIDE FOR MY FAMILY 
FIRST OF ALL THERE'S A GREAT PRIVATE CAR PARKING AREA 
GOOD FOR HANNY RIDING AROUND ON HIS BIKE SAFELY 
THIS IS THE BACK OF THE DOUBLE GARAGE IT'S GOT A REALLY GOOD SIZED WORKSHOP AT THE BACK OF IT 
A GOOD PLACE FOR TARIQ TO STORE ALL THOSE FANCY GARDEN TOOLS OF HIS 
TARIQ WILL BE GOING OOH THAT'S GOOD HE DOES LIKE HIS OUTBUILDINGS HE DOES 
NEXT DOOR THERE'S A BIG LEAN TO GREENHOUSE 
SO TRACEY WILL BE BUSY BRINGING ON HER SEEDLINGS FOR NEXT YEAR'S VEGETABLE CROP 
I'D RATHER HAVE THE GREENHOUSE AWAY FROM THE HOUSE 
BUT YOU COULD CERTAINLY OVER WINTER PUT YOUR GERANIUMS IN THERE 
THIS IS THE OUTSIDE DOOR TO THE ANNEX 
THIS IS ATTACHED TO THE MAIN HOUSE 
IT WAS BUILT BY THE CURRENT OWNERS A FEW YEARS AGO 
BUT IT'S CURRENTLY BEING KEPT AS A COMPLETELY SELF CONTAINED DWELLING 
AND IT'S BEING LET FOR SIX HUNDRED PER CALENDAR MONTH 
RENTING IT OUT IS ALL WELL AND GOOD 
BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE IT INTO THE LIVING SPACE AND HAVE ANOTHER RECEPTION ROOM 
I'M BACK IN THE MAIN HOUSE NOW 
HERE THERE ARE FOUR BEDROOMS OF VARIOUS SIZES THIS IS BEDROOM ONE 
IT'S DEFINITELY A SINGLE OR IT COULD BE USED AS A HOME OFFICE OR MAYBE HANNY COULD HAVE HIS OWN PLAY ROOM 
NEXT UP IS WHAT'S BEING USED AS A GUEST ROOM 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE I RATHER LIKE THIS BAY WINDOW THOUGH I'M NOT SURE IT WORKS WITH THE MODERN WINDOW FRAMES 
I'M NOT SURE THIS ARRANGEMENT INCORPORATES THE FIREPLACE 
GET RID OF THE CUPBOARDS AND MAKE MORE OF A FEATURE OF THE FIREPLACE 
DOWN THE CORRIDOR WE HAVE AN ORIGINAL ARCHWAY 
AND INTO WHAT IS CURRENTLY THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
THIS IS DEFINITELY A PROJECT FOR TARIQ AND TRACEY 
IT'S VERY DATED EIGHTIES 
I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE A HAPPY TIME RIPPING IT OUT LOVELY AND CLEAN 
VERY LIVEABLE WITH ON DOWN THE CORRIDOR TO BEDROOM THREE THIS IS VERY DEFINITELY A SINGLE 
IT'S RATHER GRANDLY GOT IT'S OWN EN SUITE SHOWER ROOM 
THAT'S A BIG BONUS 
SEEMS AN ODD ROOM TO HAVE A SHOWER ROOM EN SUITE 
IT'S TAKING UP QUITE A BIT OF THE ROOM AS WELL ISN'T IT 
NOW WE COME DOWN TO WHAT'S PART OF THE FIRST NEW EXTENSION 
SO BASICALLY HERE THIS IS A TWO STOREY EXTENSION 
WE HAVE THE BIG LIVING ROOM DOWNSTAIRS 
UPSTAIRS THEY'VE CREATED THIS REALLY GOOD SIZE MASTER BEDROOM 
THAT'S BETTER IT'S A BETTER SIZE 
THEN THROUGH HERE 
THEY'VE MADE A VERY SWANKY EN SUITE BATHROOM 
ONCE AGAIN I'M LOOKING AT IT THINKING QUITE A LOT'S BEEN DONE THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH TO 
THERE'S NOT A LOT TO DO THE BATHROOM THE WINDOWS 
I'VE NOW TRAVELLED EAST TO CAPEL SIX MILES SOUTH OF DORKING 
THIS PRETTY VILLAGE IS SITUATED IN THE MOLE VALLEY 
AND WAS ONCE A BUSY STAGING POST ON THE OLD COACHING ROUTES BETWEEN LONDON AND THE SOUTH COAST 
MY PROPERTY IS ONE MILE OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE BECAUSE OF THAT IT HAS A GOOD SIZE PLOT AND A RURAL LOCATION 
AXELHOLM COTTAGE IS A VICTORIAN PROPERTY SET IN GENEROUS GROUNDS 
IT ONLY HAS THREE BEDROOMS BUT COMES WITH PLANNING PERMISSION FOR EXTENSIONS 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
OH I LIKE THAT 
THAT'S PRETTY ISN'T THAT LOVELY 
HELLO TOM NICE TO SEE YOU 
THIS HOUSE SITS IN A GOOD PLOT HOW MUCH LAND IS THERE 
IT'S A THIRD OF AN ACRE THE HOUSE IS REALLY ATTRACTIVE 
I LOVE THE VARIEGATED BRICKWORK AND THE HUNG TILES ON THE FRONT IT'S A REALLY NICE FEATURE 
WHAT MORE CAN WE ASK 
THAT IS A REALLY PRETTY HOUSE 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS SMASHING 
IN WE COME 
I TAKE IT I HOPE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE CHANGES THAT MIGHT BE INCORPORATED INTO THE NEW EXTENSION 
IT'LL STAY A UTILITY BUT A MORE SUBSTANTIAL TYPE OF ROOM 
IT'S IDEAL WALK IN KICK YOUR SHOES OFF 
IT'S JUST LIKE WE'VE GOT DOWNSTAIRS 
AS IT STANDS AT THE MOMENT WE'RE COMING INTO A LITTLE STUDY AREA IT'S QUITE GOOD 
OF COURSE THIS PROPERTY IS VICTORIAN 
SO REALLY GETTING THE FEELING OF THE ERA WHICH IS LOVELY 
NICE KITCHEN CAN DO SO MUCH WITH THAT 
WHAT TRACEY AND TARIQ ARE GOING TO BE THINKING THIS IS SMALLER THAN WE'D BE HOPING FOR AS A KITCHEN 
WHAT'S THE OPTION OF GOING OUT THAT WAY WITH AN EXTENSION 
THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME POTENTIAL THERE 
THERE IS PLANNING PERMISSION GRANTED NOT ONLY FOR A TWO STOREY EXTENSION BUT A CONSERVATORY ON THE SIDE 
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO PUT SOME KIND OF SMALL EXTENSION OUT 
IT'S NOT QUITE BIG ENOUGH FOR FAMILY LIVING 
WHAT'S THROUGH THAT DOOR THERE 
THROUGH HERE WE HAVE THE BATHROOM 
CURRENTLY A DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 
IS THIS THE ONLY BATHROOM 
IT IS YES BATHROOM OFF OF KITCHEN NO NO 
WE GO BACK ACROSS THE KITCHEN 
NOW WE'RE MOVING TO THE FRONT SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
TO THE FRONT CORNER 
SEPARATE DINING ROOM 
IT'S A NICE DINING ROOM 
I DON'T KNOW I THINK MY TABLE WOULD GO IN THERE FURNITURE YOU CAN ALWAYS SELL AND BUY NEW 
WHAT MY MIND IS THINKING IS COULD YOU TAKE THAT WALL OUT 
IT'S CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY AND YOU COULD OPEN IT UP TO MAKE A NICE BIG KITCHEN DINING ROOM 
YEAH IF THAT HAS PLANNING PERMISSION FOR A CONSERVATORY OFF THE DINING ROOM 
THEN HOPEFULLY YOU COULD COME TO SOME ARRANGEMENT WITH THE COUNCIL TO MAKE IT MORE OF A PROPER ROOM 
THIS IS THE FRONT HERE AND WE'RE LOOKING OUT ON TO THE ROAD 
THIS GOES TO THE VILLAGE DOESN'T IT 
THAT'S RIGHT THIS IS A COUNTRY LANE LEADING TO VILLAGES AT EITHER END 
IS IT BUSY IT'S BUSIER AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY 
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A DUAL CARRIAGEWAY OUT THE FRONT OR THE A TWENTY FOUR ON YOUR DOORSTEP 
SO THIS IS THE SITTING ROOM 
IT FEELS REALLY SMALL I THINK THAT'S PARTLY TO DO WITH THIS IS THIS IN KEEPING 
I THINK THIS IS A LATER ADDITION 
AND POSSIBLY IT COULD BE LIGHTENED UP TO CREATE A FEELING OF A BIT MORE SPACE 
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT CLAUSTROPHOBIC MAKING 
THAT WOOD PANELLING IT'S SO DARK 
THAT ROOM'S BIGGER THAN YOU THINK IT IS 
REALLY GOOD HIGH CEILINGS HERE GOOD CEILINGS THROUGHOUT BEING A VICTORIAN HOUSE 
WITH THE BEAMS AND PANELLING THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT LOOK DARK IF THAT WAS BRIGHTER 
I'M GOING TO EXPLORE THE BEDROOMS 
I SAW ON THE DETAILS THERE'S SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY OUTSIDE THERE IS 
TRACEY ASKED ME POSSIBLY MISGUIDEDLY 
TO FIND HER A HOUSE WITH A PUB IN WALKING DISTANCE 
THIS PARTICULAR DRINKING ESTABLISHMENT IS JUST EIGHT STRIDES AWAY FROM HER OWN BACK DOOR 
BUT WHEN TARIQ AND TRACEY TOLD ME THEY WANTED A NEW PROJECT 
I DON'T THINK THEY HAD RUNNING THEIR OWN COUNTRY PUB IN MIND 
BUT THIS IS REALLY USEFUL EXTRA SPACE 
AND IT COULD BE PART OF TARIQ AND TRACEY'S GRAND PLANS FOR THIS PROPERTY 
COULD DO LOADS WITH THAT COULD HAVE AN EXCELLENT PARTY THERE 
YOU COULD BUT I THINK WE'D CHANGE IT INTO SOMETHING ELSE 
I LIKE TO GO OUT TO THE PUB UPSTAIRS YOU'VE GOT THREE BEDROOMS 
HERE IS WHERE THE ENTRANCE TO THE NEW EXTENSION WOULD BE 
YOU'D CARRY ON OUT OF HERE AND GO INTO A MASTER BEDROOM WITH AN EN SUITE BATHROOM 
TWO OF THE BEDROOMS ARE ON THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
THIS IS A BIG SINGLE OR YOU COULD SQUEEZE A DOUBLE BED IN THERE IF YOU REALLY NEEDED TO 
HANNY SIZED ROOM ISN'T IT 
ACROSS THE HALLWAY YOU'VE BEDROOM NUMBER TWO AGAIN A FAIRLY DECENT DOUBLE IT'S A GOOD SIZE GUEST ROOM 
IT'S A NICE BRIGHT ROOM YOU'D NEED A FAMILY BATHROOM SOMEWHERE UP THERE 
AT THE FRONT OF THE PROPERTY HERE AGAIN IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT 
THEY HAVE PUT NEW WINDOWS IN SO IT'S ALL DOUBLE GLAZED 
THEY'VE DONE THE WINDOWS QUITE WELL 
AT LEAST THEY'RE NOT THAT HORRIBLE P. V. C. 
BACK ACROSS THE HALLWAY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE IS BEDROOM NUMBER THREE 
IT'S CURRENTLY USED AS THE MASTER ROOM 
IT'S GOT A LITTLE FITTED CUPBOARD IN THE CORNER THERE IT'S A REALLY PLEASANT ROOM BUT THAT'S IT 
THIS HOUSE ALMOST HAS DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR 
YOU ARRIVE AND IT'S GOT THAT IMPRESSIVE CHIMNEY STACK 
IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A VICTORIAN MANOR HOUSE 
ACTUALLY IT'S A MEDIUM SIZED VICTORIAN COTTAGE 
WHAT IT NEEDS IS SOMEONE LIKE TARIQ AND TRACEY TO MAKE IT INTO THE HOUSE THAT IT OBVIOUSLY WANTS TO BE 
ONCE AGAIN IT'S THE UPSTAIRS THAT'S LETTING THE WHOLE THING DOWN 
DOWNSTAIRS HAS THE PLANNING PERMISSION I'VE KNOCKED WALLS DOWN ALREADY 
STILL TO COME TRACEY'S SURPRISED TO DISCOVER JUST WHAT SOME HOUSES COME WITH 
YEAH RIGHT 
AND REALISES THE MODERN TOUCH IS MORE APPEALING THAN SHE FIRST THOUGHT 
YOU SAID TO ME NO WE DON'T WANT MODERN GOT TO BE PERIOD 
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT MODERN MODERN IS IT NO 
IT'S UM IT'S OF AN ERA 
IT'S DAY TWO OF MY SEARCH 
I'VE TRAVELLED TO CRANLEIGH TEN MILES SOUTH OF GUILDFORD 
IT HAS A POPULATION OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND AND CLAIMS TO BE THE LARGEST VILLAGE IN ENGLAND 
IT'S NAME IS BELIEVED TO COME FROM THE LARGE CRANE BREEDING GROUNDS 
THAT WERE SITUATED HERE IN MEDIEVAL DAYS 
THE BIRD HAS NOW BECOME THE SYMBOL OF THE VILLAGE 
MY PROPERTY IS THREE MILES AWAY IN THE HAMLET OF ELLEN'S GREEN 
I CAN REPORT THERE'S NOT MUCH TO ELLEN'S GREEN 
THIS PIECE OF ROAD HERE IS PRETTY MUCH IT 
BUT FOR A SMALL PLACE THERE'S STILL QUITE A LOT ON OFFER 
THE LOCAL PUB IS JUST ACROSS THE ROAD AND I'M TOLD IT'S VERY FAMILY FRIENDLY 
THE COMMUNITY HALL IS JUST NEXT TO MY HOUSE 
THERE'S LOADS ON OFFER THERE EVERYTHING FROM BADMINTON 
TO ART CLASSES TO TABLE TENNIS 
ELM GARTH IS A NINETEEN THIRTIES FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE 
THAT COMES WITH A GENEROUS DOUBLE GARAGE 
AND IS SET IN ONE THIRD OF AN ACRE 
OH NICE GARDEN LOVELY GARDEN 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
THAT'S NICE 
HELLO EDWARD HI HOW ARE YOU GET IN IN THE DRY 
BEFORE WE GO INSIDE I WANTED TO CHECK WITH YOU 
THIS PROPERTY HAS ALREADY BEEN EXTENDED BY THE CURRENT OWNER 
YES DO YOU THINK THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING IT AGAIN 
IT'S NEARLY AT ITS MAXIMUM THIS ONE WE'LL BEAR THAT IN MIND 
LET'S GET INSIDE AND HAVE A LOOK O. K. 
OH LOVELY I LIKE THE FLOORBOARDS HERE 
THEY'RE LOVELY ORIGINAL FLOORBOARDS REALLY NICE ENTRANCE HALL 
SO THAT THROUGH THERE IS THE NEW EXTENSION YES 
WE'LL COME BACK THERE IN A MINUTE SHALL WE START HERE FIRST THIS IS THE SITTING ROOM 
IT'S SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN I'D HAVE EXPECTED FOR QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL HOUSE 
YES IT'S A WINTER ROOM I WOULD CALL THIS 
A NICE OPEN FIRE HERE 
SO IT'S A COSY ROOM 
IT'S TOO CLINICAL 
LOVELY AND CLEAN LOVELY 
IT'S JUST DONE ISN'T IT IT'S FINISHED WHAT CAN WE PERFECT 
O. K. IT'S NOT OUR TASTE BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO GO IN AND RUIN IT 
IT LOOKS IMMACULATE HAS THE CURRENT OWNER DONE A LOT OF WORK YES 
HE IS KEEN ON THE INTERIOR DECORATION OF IT 
MY ONLY THOUGHT IS TRACEY AND TARIQ WOULD QUITE LIKE TO DO WORK 
IN A WAY IT'S A BLANK CANVAS THOUGH IT IS IT IS O. K. 
LET'S CARRY ON SO WE SORT OF CARRY ON TOWARDS TO THE BACK 
IF YOU GO TO YOUR LEFT INTO THE FAMILY ROOM 
YOU HAVE THE LITTLE LOO IN THERE LITTLE CLOAKROOM IN THERE 
AS WE COME THROUGH I'LL SHOW YOU 
THIS IS THE FAMILY SUITE 
WE HAVE A CLOAKROOM AND A SHOWER BEHIND HERE 
SO THEY USE THIS AS A GUEST SUITE 
YOU CAN CLOSE THIS DOOR AND THIS IS YOUR GUEST AREA THAT'S RIGHT 
THE THING I NOTICE IMMEDIATELY 
IS THE LOVELY DOORS ON TO THE DECKING AND THE GARDEN 
THAT'S A LOVELY VIEW 
IT'S A LOVELY ROOM BUT I'D DEFINITELY WANT IT AS A RECEPTION ROOM 
I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T HAVE A BEDROOM 
SHALL WE GO BACK ACROSS AND LOOK AT THE KITCHEN AND THE EXTENSION 
OOH GOSH LOVELY BIG ROOM 
ISN'T THIS GREAT SO MUCH SPACE THAT FLOOR IS AMAZING 
THAT LOOKS SO LOVELY I MUST ADMIT I'VE ALWAYS SORT OF THOUGHT 
EURGH BLACK AND WHITE FLOORS BUT THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD 
I LOVE THE SPACE 
THE KITCHEN ITSELF LOOKS VERY NEW WHEN WAS THIS PUT IN 
THIS IS ABOUT SIX YEARS OLD I WOULD WANT GRANITE WORKTOPS 
COS I WOULDN'T WANT TO LOOK AFTER THOSE AND I DO DO A LOT OF COOKING 
I LOVE THE FACT YOU HAVE TWO SETS OF DOORS 
YOU'VE GOT THE DECKING THAT WRAPS AROUND THE OUTSIDE 
SO IT'S BEEN EXTENDED ALREADY THERE DONE 
IT'S DONE IT'S TOO BEAUTIFUL IT'S TOO LOVELY 
ACTUALLY IF WE GO DOWN TO THIS SET OF DOORS 
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO HAVE A LOOK OUT AND SEE THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
THE DECKING'S AMAZING 
A GOOD SIZE ABOUT A THIRD OF AN ACRE IN TOTAL 
ONE OF THE REASONS I CHOSE THE PROPERTY 
WAS THE IDEA THAT MAYBE YOU COULD BUILD A SEPARATE BUILDING 
ON THE PLOT WHICH YOU COULD DO AND NOT TAKE UP TOO MUCH SPACE 
THERE IS SPACE TO THE SIDE WHICH YOU COULD UTILISE 
SO THEN YOU'D STILL HAVE ALL OF THIS SPACE OUTSIDE 
IT'S ALL VERY NICE AND THE THING IS I'D WANT TO ADD TO THE HOUSE 
YOU COULD ALWAYS THINK OF THAT THE GROUNDS THAT'S A FANTASTIC GARDEN YEAH BUT I WANT A BIGGER HOUSE 
BEARING IN MIND WE ALREADY HAVE THE DOUBLE BEDROOM DOWNSTAIRS 
WITH ITS LITTLE SELF CONTAINED SHOWER UNIT 
UPSTAIRS THERE ARE FOUR MORE BEDROOMS 
THIS IS CLASSED AS A SINGLE BEDROOM BUT I THINK FOR A VERY SMALL PERSON 
IT'S CURRENTLY BEING USED AS A STUDY THAT'S PROBABLY ITS BEST USE 
I'D SAY STUDY 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GET RID OF THE BEDROOM DOWNSTAIRS 
OTHERWISE YOU ONLY HAVE ONE RECEPTION ROOM PLUS YOUR KITCHEN 
STILL MAKES IT FOUR BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS EVEN IF ONE IS SMALL YES 
ACROSS THE HALLWAY 
IN THE MIDDLE WE HAVE THE BATHROOM 
A PRETTY GOOD SIZE THE MAIN SELLING POINT ABOUT IT 
IS THAT IT'S GOT FANTASTIC VIEWS OUT OVER THE BACK 
NICE SIZE BATHROOM LOVELY 
TOO LOVELY 
THEN NEXT DOOR THIS IS A GOOD SIZE DOUBLE ROOM 
AGAIN IT'S LOOKING OUT OVER THE BACK OVER THAT LOVELYGARDEN 
IT'S A NICE ASPECT OH YEAH IT'S LOVELY 
LOOKING OUT THERE 
STRAIGHT ACROSS THE FIELDS NOBODY LOOKING IN 
THEN ON DOWN THE HALLWAY THE FINAL TWO BEDROOMS 
BOTH AT THE FRONT OF THE PROPERTY THIS ONE IS A SLIGHTLY STRANGE SHAPE 
SO IT CAN REALLY ONLY BE A SINGLE ROOM 
OR YOU COULD SQUEEZE ANOTHER SINGLE BED IN AND MAKE IT A TWIN ROOM 
I ACTUALLY LIKE THAT GOOD FAMILY ROOM 
I LIKE IT BUT I WISH IT WAS BIGGER 
I LIKE ALL THE LITTLE BITS LOVELY CHILD ROOM 
THEN NEXT DOOR IS WHAT'S BEING USED AS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
IT'S ALL INCREDIBLY IMMACULATE AND ELEGANT 
IT'S GOT GOOD FITTED CUPBOARDS IN HERE BUT IT'S REALLY PRETTY WELL DONE 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL BUT IT'S NOT AT ALL YOU 
NO IT'S NOT ME 
I KNOW THAT TARIQ AND TRACEY WILL THINK 
WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THIS PROPERTY THAT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN DONE 
I THOUGHT I'D SHOW THEM ANOTHER OPTION 
THIS HOUSE IS READY MADE THEY COULD MOVE STRAIGHT IN AND THEY COULD START A SEPARATE PROJECT 
BY BUILDING A DIFFERENT DWELLING IN THE LAND NEXT DOOR TO THE HOUSE 
WE ARE IN GREENBELT HERE AND EDWARD SAYS THAT THE PLANNING AUTHORITIES ARE PRETTY STRICT 
BUT IF YOU PUT IN PLANS THAT AREN'T TOO EXTRAVAGANT AND ARE IN KEEPING WITH THE AREA 
YOU'VE A CHANCE OF GETTING PERMISSION 
IT'S NOT A VERY BIG PROJECT 
NO 
DEFINITELY NEED MORE WORK TO DO THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO 
FOR MY FINAL PROPERTY I'VE TRAVELLED TO CHIDDINGFOLD JUST INSIDE SURREY 
OUTSIDE LONDON SURREY HAS ON AVERAGE THE MOST EXPENSIVE PROPERTY IN THE U. K. 
AND CHIDDINGFOLD IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF ITS PRETTIEST VILLAGES 
TRACEY FANCIES THE IDEA OF LIVING NEAR A VILLAGE GREEN 
I'VE DISCOVERED THIS ONE HAS A REAL COMMUNITY SPIRIT TO IT 
HARD TO IMAGINE ON A DAY LIKE TODAY BUT THE LOCALS HOLD AN ANNUAL SUMMER FETE HERE 
AND THERE'S ALSO A MAGNIFICENT BONFIRE NIGHT 
THAT ATTRACTS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM THE LOCAL AREA 
AND THERE'S ONE FINAL BONUS JUST OVER THERE IS A WELL REPUTED PRIMARY SCHOOL 
GREENODD IS A FOUR BEDROOM HOME JUST A SHORT WALK FROM THE VILLAGE 
IT WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN SIXTY 
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE MODERN THAN TRACEY AND TARIQ WOULD PREFER 
HOPEFULLY THE EXCELLENT VILLAGE LOCATION WILL OUTWEIGH THAT 
THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
IT IS VERY NEW 
YOU COULD DO AN EXTENSION STRAIGHT OVER THE GARAGES 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
OWNER KATE FARINGTON IS GOING TO SHOW ME AROUND 
NICE TO SEE YOU AND YOU 
SO A VERY GOOD SIZED PORCH AREA THERE 
WHICH IS HANDY AND STRAIGHT INTO WHAT YOU ARE USING AS A DINING ROOM 
THAT'S RIGHT A FAMILY DINING ROOM 
DOES THIS WORK ALL RIGHT WITH IT BEING A THROUGH AREA 
IT'S ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR PARTIES 
SO YOU'RE COOKING IN THE KITCHEN AND PEOPLE ARE HERE ALL SITTING IN THE SITTING ROOM 
THAT'S THE KITCHEN IN THERE SMALL KITCHEN IN THERE WHAT'S THROUGH THAT DOOR THERE 
A SMALL HALLWAY DOWN TO A CLOAKROOM AND TWO DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOMS 
O. K. I'LL COME BACK AND HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE IN A MINUTE BUT WE'LL DO THE LIVING AREAS FIRST 
IT'S A BIT ODD STRAIGHT INTO THE DINING ROOM 
YEAH STAIRS IN THE DINING ROOM 
I'D LIKE THAT AS A NICE BIG HALLWAY 
LET'S CARRY ON THROUGH UP HERE KATE AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE NEXT ROOM 
RIGHT IT'S A FUNNY MIXTURE THIS HOUSE 
IT'S GOT SOME LOVELY OLDER DETAILS LIKE THAT BUT IT FEELS MODERN 
WHEN WAS IT BUILT 
MY FATHER HAD IT DESIGNED AND BUILT IN FIFTY NINE SIXTY 
IT'S ALL THERE IT'S JUST IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IT IS 
IT'S TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND THE IDEA OF A MORE MODERN PROPERTY 
ONE OF MY FAMILY'S BUG BEARS ABOUT NEWER HOUSES ARE FLIMSY WALLS 
SO EXCUSE ME IF I GO AND HAVE A BIT OF A. 
THAT FEELS FAIRLY SOLID 
IT'S VERY SOLID I THINK FINE 
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE WAY THEY'VE DESIGNED IT ARE THE BIG WINDOWS 
AGAIN IN THE DINING ROOM WE HAVE A FLOOR TO CEILING WINDOW THERE 
THEN YOU HAVE THE WINDOWS ON THIS SIDE LOOKING OUT OVER THE FRONT SO IT'S PERFECT 
SO IT'S SOLID WALLS 
GOT SOLID WALLS VIEWS 
BOTH ENDS OF YOUR IT LOOKS LIKE A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN 
THEN THROUGH INTO THE NEXT ROOM 
SHALL WE GO THROUGH 
THIS IS THE FAMILY MUSIC ROOM 
WITH THE BIG WINDOWS LEADING ONTO THE GARDEN 
SO YOU'VE FRENCH WINDOWS ON BOTH SIDES THAT'S RIGHT 
SO IN THE SUMMER YOU'RE MAKING IT PART OF THE GARDEN REALLY EXACTLY 
THAT'S A LOVELY SIZE ROOM 
YOU'D GET RID OF THE THERE IS A LOT OF CHANGES YEAH 
YOU HAVE A SPIRAL STAIRCASE WHERE DOES THAT GO TO 
THAT GOES UP TO A BEDROOM AND BATHROOM AND A BALCONY UPSTAIRS 
CAN YOU IMAGINE HANNY ON THEM 
HE'S BAD ENOUGH ON A NORMAL STAIRCASE 
BACK ACROSS THE DINING ROOM INTO THE KITCHEN YES 
QUITE SMALL IT IS SMALL FOR THIS DAY AND AGE 
I HAVE SPOKEN TO BUILDERS AND ARCHITECTS 
THE WALL HERE ISN'T LOAD BEARING RIGHT 
SO TO EXTEND IT BACK AT LEAST INTO THE ONE BEDROOM 
DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU FIT IN THE KITCHEN WOULD BE TWENTY THOUSAND O. K. 
WHICH WOULD SACRIFICE YOUR BEDROOM THERE 
YES IS THERE ANY WAY THEY THOUGHT YOU COULD PUT ANOTHER BEDROOM IN 
YES PUTTING A DIFFERENT PORCH ON THE FRONT WITH A BEDROOM ABOVE 
SO THEN YOU'LL HAVE THE THREE BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS 
MY PROBLEM IS I NOW NEED TO HAVE A WANDER AROUND 
AND PICTURE WHERE THIS IS SO I'LL HAVE AN EXPLORE AND SEE YOU LATER 
LOVELY O. K. THANK YOU 
SMALL KITCHEN YEAH BUT 
AS CATHERINE SAID 
YOU CAN KNOCK THROUGH INTO THE OTHER BEDROOM 
WHICH WE HAVEN'T SEEN YET SO WE DON'T KNOW 
HOW MUCH SPACE YOU'D BE LOSING OR GAINING 
BUT IDEAL PROJECT 
WOW GET THE HAMMER OUT 
THERE ARE CURRENTLY AND I STRESS CURRENTLY FOUR BEDROOMS IN THIS PROPERTY 
AND IT'S SLIGHTLY TOPSY TURVY BECAUSE TWO OF THEM ARE ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
DOWN THIS LITTLE CORRIDOR HERE ALONG WITH A DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 
THEY'RE TWO IDENTICALLY SIZED ROOMS BUT THESE ARE THE ONES 
THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY BE SACRIFICED 
TO MAKE A GOOD SIZED KITCHEN SLASH BREAKFAST ROOM FOR MY FAMILY 
WHICH MEANS THEY'D HAVE TO RECOUP SOME BEDROOMS SO I'LL GO UPSTAIRS AND SEE WHERE THAT COULD BE DONE 
THAT BEDROOM IS SO SMALL ANYWAY 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE TO THE KITCHEN 
IT'S GOT TWO BEDROOMS DOWNSTAIRS IT'S ALSO GOT TWO SETS OF STAIRS 
THAT IS THE FIRST ONE I'VE COME UP WE HAVE A LITTLE LANDING HERE THIS IS A REALLY GOOD VANTAGE POINT 
ONE OF KATE'S PLANS IS TO HAVE THE PORCH MASSIVELY EXTENDED AND TO BUILD ANOTHER BEDROOM ON TOP OF IT 
WHICH WOULD ADD TO THE ALREADY EXISTING BEDROOM ON THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
IT'S A GOOD SIZED DOUBLE AND AGAIN IT'S GOT THE MASSIVE PICTURE WINDOWS 
LOOKING DOWN OVER THE BIG GARDEN SO IT FEELS REALLY COUNTRIFIED 
NEXT DOOR IS THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD SIZE ACTUALLY I QUITE LIKE IT 
IN A RETRO CHIC KIND OF WAY 
THAT'S A NICE BATHROOM NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT NICE BIG SINK 
THEN FINALLY IN THIS SECTION 
THIS MAY LOOK LIKE A CUPBOARD BUT OPEN IT UP 
AND IT'S ACTUALLY ACCESS TO A REALLY GOOD UNUSED ROOF SPACE 
NOW THE INDUSTRIOUS KATE HAS ALSO HAD HER BUILDER QUOTE 
TO MAKE THIS INTO A PROPER BEDROOM HE RECKONS IT WOULD COST EIGHT THOUSAND TO TEN THOUSAND 
A GOOD SIZED BEDROOM IT WOULD MAKE 
YEAH YEAH IT WOULD 
YOU DO DEFINITELY NEED ANOTHER BEDROOM ROUND THERE 
I'LL COME BACK THROUGH TO THE BIGGER LIVING ROOM 
THIS IS THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE WHICH LEADS TO THE UPSTAIRS OF THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE 
THIS WAS ADDED MORE RECENTLY TO CREATE A KIND OF MASTER SUITE 
ON THIS SIDE OF THE STAIRCASE YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY DECENT SIZED BATHROOM 
NICE SIZED BATHROOM YEAH 
THEN THIS IS THE BEDROOM 
QUITE SMALL AGAIN THE TROUBLE IS IF WE'RE THERE AND HANNY IS DOWNSTAIRS 
THE BIG SELLING POINT FOR THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
IS OUT HERE IT'S ALSO GOT ITS OWN BALCONY 
AFTER ALL OF THOSE HOURS EXTENDING AND RENOVATING THE PROPERTY 
THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE FOR TARIQ AND TRACEY TO RELAX AND SURVEY THEIR TERRITORY 
SUCH A FANTASTIC GARDEN PLENTY OF SPACE DOWN THERE FOR THE VEGETABLE PATCH 
AND FOR HANNY TO RUN AROUND THE GREAT THING IS WE ARE RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE VILLAGE 
WHAT A LOVELY CHILD FRIENDLY GARDEN 
IT'S AMAZING IT'S BRILLIANT 
GOOD SIZE LOVELY LOCATION 
HAVING SEEN ALL FOUR PROPERTIES 
TRACEY MUST NOW DECIDE WHICH TWO SHE WISHES TO VISIT 
SALMIC IS A FOUR BEDROOM EDWARDIAN HOUSE 
WHICH COMES WITH OUTBUILDINGS AND AN ANNEX 
IT'S CLOSE TO ROAD LINKS WHICH WILL SUIT TARIQ'S COMMUTING REQUIREMENTS 
AND IS ON THE MARKET FOR SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
AXELHOLM COTTAGE IS A VICTORIAN PROPERTY 
SET IN GENEROUS GROUNDS AND SURROUNDED BY FARMLAND 
IT HAS THREE BEDROOMS AND COMES WITH PLANNING PERMISSION FOR EXTENSIONS 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
WHICH LEAVES PLENTY OF MONEY FOR THE WORKS 
MY PROPERTY IN ELLEN'S GREEN IS A NINETEEN THIRTIES FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE 
THAT COMES WITH A DOUBLE GARAGE AND IS SET IN A THIRD OF AN ACRE 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
MY ONLY CONCERN IS IT'S ALREADY REFURBISHED TO A HIGH STANDARD 
SO TRACEY AND TARIQ WILL BE LIMITED TO WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH IT 
MY FINAL PROPERTY GREENODD IS A FOUR BEDROOM HOME FOR SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
IT WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN SIXTY SO IT'S MORE MODERN THAN TRACEY AND TARIQ WANT 
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL SPOT ITS POTENTIAL AND ENVIABLE LOCATION 
RIGHT SALMIC HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY GARDEN 
NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR 
TOO RURAL 
SO NO NO 
AXELHOLME COTTAGE 
SO PRETTY 
I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE THAT ONE I THINK 
SO ON THE DEFINITE 
ELM GARTH TOO 
FANTASTIC HOUSE ALL DONE 
NOT ENOUGH OF A PROJECT 
NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH OF A PROJECT SO PUT THAT IN THE NO 
GREENODD I NEVER THOUGHT WE'D GO FOR SOMETHING SO MODERN 
BUT IT IS GROWING ON ME AND I LIKE THE LOCATION OF THIS ONE AS WELL 
SO THAT'S A DEFINITE 
SO GREENODD GREENODD AND AXELHOLM COTTAGE 
HELLO HELLO HI LISA NICE TO MEET YOU HI TRACEY HELLO 
A VERY EXCITING DAY HERE'S PROPERTY ONE WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS VERY PRETTY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE GARDEN IT'S BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT LOVELY LET'S HAVE A LOOK AROUND 
SO THIS IS THE BIT WHERE THE PLANS ARE IN PLACE TO CHANGE THE DOOR PUT A UTILITY ROOM THERE 
SO YOU COULD MAKE THIS SO MUCH BIGGER 
MAKE IT INTO MORE OF A PROPER ROOM 
IT'S NICE COME THROUGH THIS IS SORT OF 
OBVIOUSLY IT'S HARD TO GET AN IDEA UNTIL YOU SEE THE REST OF THE LAYOUT HERE 
THIS IS THE KITCHEN OH RIGHT 
THIS IS ABOUT THE SIZE I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE 
IT'S GOT A LOT OF CHARACTER SO COULD YOU LIVE WITH IT AS IT IS 
IT'S FINE YOU COULD LIVE WITH IT UNTIL YOU DID SOMETHING WITH IT 
MY IDEA WAS YOU COULD EITHER GO THAT WAY OR GO OUT THAT WAY 
IT'S A CASE OF YOU'D HAVE TO SIT DOWN WITH THE FLOOR PLAN AND GET THE PEN OUT 
THAT DOOR IN THE CORNER IS THE BATHROOM 
RIGHT SO YOU HAVE A DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM AT THE MOMENT 
LET'S CARRY ON WITH THE LIVING ACCOMMODATION FIRST 
DINING ROOM YES 
I'D DEFINITELY HAVE TO TRY AND TAKE THIS OUT 
THE PLANNING PERMISSION WAS IN HERE WAS IT FOR 
EXTENDING THAT WAY 
THERE ARE PLANS TO GO THAT WAY WITH A CONSERVATORY THAT ARE IN PLACE 
WHAT ABOUT THE FEEL OF IT YOU SAID YOU WANTED AN OLD HOUSE 
IT'S A LOVELY FEEL 
IT'S GOT A NICE FEEL IT'S COSY 
IF YOU GO BACK OUT THIS WAY IF YOU WANT TO LEAD ON AND THROUGH HERE IS THE SITTING ROOM 
ARE YOU STUNNED INTO SILENCE 
IT LOOKS SMALLER COS OF THE PANELLING YEAH 
I DON'T THINK THE PANELLING IS ORIGINAL IS IT OH NO 
I'LL LET THE TWO OF YOU HAVE AN EXPLORE AROUND THE REST OF THE HOUSE 
AND THEN WE'LL GET TOGETHER LATER AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK LOVELY O. K. OFF YOU GO 
THIS IS A NICE SIZE 
OVER THE FRONT GARDEN 
THAT ROAD ACTUALLY IS QUITE QUIET 
IT'S QUIET IT IS QUIET OH LOOK FIREPLACE 
OH 
SO BEHIND THERE YEAH TAKE ALL OF THAT OUT 
YOU COULD MAKE A NICE FEATURE 
IT'S A LOVELY ROOM IT'S NICE AND BRIGHT 
IT'S A PUB 
OH WOW 
IT'S A PUB WITH CHANDELIERS 
OH DON'T THEY LOOK LIKE THE ONES IN MY HALLWAY 
THERE'S TWO BAR STOOLS ONE FOR YOU AND ME WE COULD SIT BEHIND THERE WE COULD PRETEND 
I CAN'T SEE IT STAYING AS A PUB SOMEHOW UNFORTUNATELY 
THAT'S A WORRY 
NOW THEN YOU'VE SEEN THE WHOLE THING TRACEY WHAT DO YOU THINK 
VERY NICE A LOVELY FEELING TO THE HOUSE VERY COSY 
IS YOUR MIND WHIRRING WITH PLANS 
OH YES YES LOTS TO THINK ABOUT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE FEEL OF IT 
IT'S GOT A LOVELY FAMILY HOME FEEL 
SO THE BASICS ARE RIGHT HANG ON TO THOSE THOUGHTS 
COS WE'VE ANOTHER ONE TO SEE LET'S HEAD OFF TO PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
HERE WE ARE PROPERTY NUMBER TWO I MEAN THIS IS 
THIS IS MOST PEOPLE'S BACK GARDENS 
IF WE JUST STOP HERE WE CAN GET A PROPER IMPRESSION OF THE HOUSE FROM THE OUTSIDE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK TRACEY IT'S A LOT NICER THAN IT LOOKED ON THE BROCHURE 
LET'S GET INSIDE AND LOOK AROUND 
WHAT DO YOU THINK YEAH IT'S SO MUCH BIGGER THAN I WAS EXPECTING 
THIS ONE IS MORE SPACIOUS 
THAT'S IN ITS DESIGN REALLY 
YOU'VE GOT THIS AS A DINING ROOM DO YOU THINK THAT'S HOW YOU'D KEEP IT 
AFTER LOOKING AT THE FLOOR PLANS 
I'D WANT TO EXTEND OUT SO THIS WOULD BE A NICE BIG HALLWAY 
LET'S GO THIS WAY FIRST YOU HAVE THE KITCHEN THERE WE'LL COME TO TO THAT IN A MOMENT 
THIS IS NICE 
YOU SAID TO ME OH NO WE DON'T WANT MODERN GOT TO BE PERIOD 
NO BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK IT'S NOT MODERN MODERN 
IT'S REALLY NICE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK LISA I LOVE IT 
THERE WE GO 
SO WE'VE GOT WINDOWS ON BOTH SIDES YOU'VE GOT A FIREPLACE 
AND YOU'VE GOT THESE FRENCH DOORS GOING THROUGH 
THIS WAS A LATER ADDITION THIS FINAL ROOM 
WOW THIS IS LOVELY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK TARIQ WOULD THINK OF IT 
I'M NOT SURE HE'D LITERALLY HAVE TO COME HERE 
COS YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE FROM THE BROCHURE 
O. K. WELL THE THING THAT REALLY NEEDS WORK IS THE KITCHEN 
LET'S HEAD BACK ACROSS THESE TWO ROOMS AND GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT THAT NEXT 
TINY YES NOT QUITE WHAT YOU'RE USED TO 
NO BUT THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED A PROJECT 
I'M GOING TO LET THE TWO OF YOU HAVE A REALLY GOOD EXPLORE 
HAVE A LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER POTENTIAL AREAS YOU COULD ADD ON 
AND WE WILL GET TOGETHER AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK 
LOVELY THANK YOU 
OH WOW 
THIS IS A NICE SIZED ROOM FOR A GUEST ROOM 
HAVE ALL YOUR BUILT IN CUPBOARDS IT'S GOT A BALCONY BUT THEN AGAIN 
IT WON'T BE THERE LONG HOPEFULLY 
AS LONG AS YOU COULD GET PERMISSION THAT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO DO THE EXTENSION 
OH WOW THIS IS JUST SOMETHING ELSE 
THAT IS AN AMAZING GARDEN 
I'M NOT SURE WHERE I'D PUT MY VEGETABLE PLOT YOU HAVE A BIT OF CHOICE 
YEAH FAIR BIT OF CHOICE THERE'S A GOOD FEW OPTIONS 
YOU CAN IMAGINE HAVING AN EXTENSION COMING OUT GORGEOUS 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL IT'S GOT EVERYTHING IT HAS 
SO WE'VE COME TO THE END OF OUR BIG HOUSE HUNTING DAY 
THE BIG QUESTION IS OF THE TWO PROPERTIES WHICH ONE DID YOU PREFER 
DEFINITELY THIS ONE 
SO HAVE YOU SURPRISED YOURSELF BY LIKING THIS ONE SO MUCH 
YES VERY MUCH SO I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO HATE IT 
BUT I CERTAINLY DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE SO POSITIVE ABOUT IT 
WHAT BROUGHT YOU ROUND TO THIS HOUSE WHY DO YOU LIKE IT SO MUCH BECAUSE IT'S GOT SO MUCH POTENTIAL 
IT FEELS REALLY NICE 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY SOLID HOUSE 
SO WHAT'S THE NEXT MOVE 
I THINK IT'S A CASE OF 
TALK TO TARIQ 
THE OWNER'S VERY KINDLY LET ME TAKE SOME PHOTOGRAPHS 
SO I CAN TAKE THOSE BACK TO HIM 
AT LEAST I'LL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN A BIT MORE 
COS UNTIL YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN THIS HOUSE 
YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN IT PROPERLY 
SO GIVEN THAT WE'VE COME TO A HOUSE THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
FROM THE KIND OF HOUSE YOU ASKED ME TO FIND FOR YOU 
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT IN OUR PROPERTY SEARCH TOGETHER 
I THINK THE FIRST THING IS I REALISED THAT I DO WANT TO BE IN A COMMUNITY 
THE OTHER HOUSE WAS JUST TOO FAR OUT 
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ONLY A MILE AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE IT WAS TOO FAR OUT FOR ME 
AND ALSO TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND ON THE PROPERTIES THAT YOU LOOK AT 
I SHALL WAIT WITH BAITED BREATH TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENS YOU TALK THAT HUSBAND OF YOURS AROUND 
SINCE FILMING TARIQ AND TRACEY HAVE BOUGHT 
AN EIGHT BEDROOM HOUSE IN EASTBOURNE 
IN THE END HANNY'S SCHOOLING 
WAS THE DECIDING FACTOR ON THEIR CHOICE OF LOCATION 
JUST TALK TO US 
IF I TELL THE WORLD 
I'LL NEVER SAY ENOUGH 
COS IT WAS NOT SAID TO YOU 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED TO DO 
IF I END UP WITH YOU 
TALK 
HOLBY BLUE BEING A GOOD COP IS JUST THE HALF OF IT
