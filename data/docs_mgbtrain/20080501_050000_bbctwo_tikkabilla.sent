TIKKABILLA TOCKABILLA 
TIKKABILLA TOCK 
WHAT'S THE TIME ON THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
WELL THE LONG HAND IS POINTING TOWARDS THE NUMBER TWELVE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS 
THAT MEANS IT'S SOMETHING O'CLOCK 
AND THE SHORT HAND IS POINTING TO THE NUMBER TWO 
SO THE CLOCK SAYS IT'S TWO O'CLOCK 
BUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CLOCK 
IT'S A SMALL TIGER 
AND THE STORY IS CALLED THE LOUDEST ROAR 
RIGHT 
THE JUNGLE WAS A PEACEFUL PLACE 
EVERYONE WAS QUIET 
EVERYONE WAS CALM 
WELL NEARLY EVERYONE 
CLOVIS WAS A TIGER 
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS ONLY SMALL 
HE KNEW HE WAS THE FIERCEST MOST ROARINGEST TIGER IN THE WHOLE WORLD 
AND CLOVIS THOUGHT THAT EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW IT TOO 
ONE DAY HE SAW SOME PARROTS 
CHATTING POLITELY AS THEY PICKED THEIR JUICY FRUIT 
SUDDENLY THERE WAS CLOVIS 
HE FOUND SOME MUDDY WILDEBEEST 
WALLOWING HAPPILY IN THEIR SLIMY SWAMP 
THEY DIDN'T SEE THE ROARINGEST TIGER IN THE WHOLE WORLD 
ROOOAAR 
THEN SUDDENLY THERE WAS CLOVIS 
THE MIGHTY ELEPHANTS WERE SUNNING THEMSELVES PEACEFULLY 
AT THE EDGE OF THE JUNGLE 
SUDDENLY THERE WAS CLOVIS 
OH YES SAID CLOVIS PROUDLY 
I'VE GOT THE LOUDEST ROAR IN ALL THE JUNGLE 
THE ANIMALS BEGAN TO COMPLAIN 
WHY SHOULD HE SPOIL OUR PEACE SQUAWKED AN ANGRY PARROT 
BUT WHAT CAN THEY D. O. 
THEN A MONKEY WHO WAS VERY CLEVER HAD AN IDEA 
CLOVIS DIDN'T NOTICE THE OTHERS CREEPING UP ON HIM 
THEN SUDDENLY 
SQUAWK SQUAWK OOH OOH OOH RAA RAA 
RRRRUH RRRRUH 
SQUAWK 
AROO 
CLOVIS WAS VERY SURPRISED 
IT WAS THE LOUDEST ROAR HE HAD EVER HEARD 
THE LITTLE MONKEY LOOKED UP 
AT THE FIERCEST MOST ROARINGEST TIGER IN THE WORLD 
IF YOU PROMISE NOT TO ROAR AT US HE SAID 
THEN WE PROMISE NOT TO ROAR AT YOU 
CLOVIS SAID HE WOULD TRY 
THE JUNGLE WAS A PEACEFUL PLACE 
EVERYONE WAS QUIET 
EVERYONE WAS CALM 
AND CLOVIS WAS VERY WELL BEHAVED 
WELL MOST OF THE TIME 
ROAR 
CLOVIS WAS A VERY NOISY ANIMAL WASN'T HE 
I LIKE MAKING LOTS OF NOISE TOO SOMETIMES 
ESPECIALLY 
WHEN I'M BY MYSELF 
WHEN LIFE IS RATHER QUIET 
THERE'S NOTHING MUCH TO DO 
WHEN NO ONE IS ABOUT 
APART OF COURSE FROM YOU 
THERE'S NOTHING THAT IS BETTER 
MORE FUN FOR GIRLS AND BOYS 
THAN TO LET OUT ALL YOUR FEELINGS 
AND MAKE A LOT OF 
YOU CAN BASH YOU CAN CRASH YOU CAN BANG AND YOU CAN CRANG 
YOU CAN TING YOU CAN PING YOU CAN EVEN DING A LING 
YOU CAN BASH YOU CAN CRASH YOU CAN BANG AND YOU CAN CRANG 
YOU CAN TING YOU CAN PING 
YOU CAN EVEN DING A LING LING LING LING LING LING LING LING 
WHAT CAN YOU DO IF NOTHING CAN BE FOUND 
IF NOTHING'S LYING ROUND YOUR ROOM THAT MAKES A NOISY SOUND 
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE GOT 
THAT MAKES A SPECIAL NOISE 
YOU HAVE IT ALWAYS WITH YOU 
IT'S SOMETHING CALLED YOUR 
YOU CAN SPEAK YOU CAN TALK YOU CAN SQUEAK AND YOU CAN SQUAWK 
YOU CAN SCREAM YOU CAN SHOUT YOU CAN SCREECH AND JUMP ABOUT 
YOU CAN SPEAK YOU CAN TALK YOU CAN SQUEAK AND YOU CAN SQUAWK 
YOU CAN SCREAM YOU CAN SHOUT 
YOU CAN SCREECH AND JUMP ABOUT BOUT BOUT BOUT BOUT BOUT BOUT 
YOU'VE MADE SOME SPECIAL SOUNDS SOME PEOPLE CALL A DIN 
YOU'VE LET YOUR NOISY FEELINGS OUT 
THEY'RE BETTER OUT THAN IN 
THERE'S ONE MORE THING YOU HAVE TO DO 
IT'S REALLY FOR THE BEST 
I'M SURE YOU KNOW WHAT THAT THING IS 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A. 
A REST 
HA HA 
MORE NOISE 
I'M GOING TO MAKE A DRUM AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE IT 
I'VE GOT WOODEN SPOONS FOR DRUMSTICKS 
I'LL PUT THOSE THERE 
AND HERE I'VE GOT A BISCUIT TIN TO MAKE A DRUM 
I'LL JUST TAKE THE LID OFF WE DON'T NEED THAT FOR A MOMENT 
I'M GOING TO MAKE A STRAP FOR MY DRUM 
TO MAKE THE STRAP I'VE GOT THIS ROPE 
AND LOOK IT'S GOT TASSELS 
NOW WHAT WE DO IS WE LOOP THE END OF THE ROPE OVER 
THEN WE STICK THE LOOP TO THE INSIDE OF THE TIN 
WITH SOME STICKY TAPE LIKE THAT 
AND THEN I'M GOING TO DO THE SAME WITH THE OTHER SIDE 
SO WE LOOP IT OVER 
STICK THE LOOP ON THE INSIDE OF THE BISCUIT TIN 
LIKE THAT 
AND THERE WE HAVE A STRAP FOR OUR DRUM 
LET'S JUST POP THE ROPE AND THE TASSELS ON THE INSIDE FOR NOW 
SO THEY DON'T GET IN OUR WAY 
WE NEED TO DECORATE THE SIDES OF THE DRUM 
TO DECORATE IT I'VE GOT A STRIP OF PAPER 
I'VE CUT THIS OUT TO EXACTLY THE RIGHT SIZE 
AND NOW I'M GOING TO DECORATE IT 
AND I'M GOING TO DECORATE IT WITH A GREEN PEN 
AND I'M GOING TO DRAW ZIGZAGS 
ZIGZAGS LOOK LIKE THIS 
THERE THEY LOOK A BIT LIKE MOUNTAINS 
AND THEY LOOK A BIT LIKE TEETH DON'T THEY 
AND THEY'RE ALSO A TRIANGLE 
LOOK THEY'VE GOT ONE TWO THREE SIDES 
SO DRAW ZIGZAGS ALL THE WAY ALONG MY STRIP OF PAPER 
LIKE THAT 
NOW I'D LIKE TO DRAW SOME DOTS ON MY PIECE OF PAPER

ONE THAT'S TWO RED DOTS 
THREE RED DOTS FOUR 
FIVE SIX

LET'S HAVE A LOOK MORE DOTS 
THERE WE GO IT'S NEARLY DONE 
NOW WHEN YOU'VE FINISHED DECORATING YOUR STRIP OF PAPER 
AND YOU CAN DO IT WITH WHATEVER YOU WANT FLOWERS OR ANYTHING 
YOU NEED TO STICK IT TO THE SIDE OF THE BISCUIT TIN 
I'LL JUST POP THAT TO ONE SIDE THAT OUT OF THE WAY 
YOU'LL SEE WHY IN A MOMENT 
I'M GOING TO GLUE THE SIDE OF THE TIN 
SOME GLUE HERE 
NOW LET'S PUT LOTS OF GLUE ALL THE WAY ROUND 
LOTS AND LOTS OF STICKY GLUE 
CAREFUL YOU DON'T STICK YOUR FINGERS 
THERE WE GO AND THAT'S ALL THE WAY AROUND 
NOW YOU TURN YOUR STRIP OF PAPER OVER THE OTHER WAY 
AND THEN YOU STICK IT TO THE SIDE OF YOUR DRUM 
AND IF YOU ROLL THE DRUM LIKE A WHEEL 
HOPEFULLY IT WILL STICK TO THE SIDES 
YAY AND THERE WE'VE GOT A DECORATED DRUM 
OH BUT THE DRUM HASN'T GOT A TOP 
SO WE CAN'T MAKE ANY NOISE 
AND THAT'S WHERE WE NEED THE LID 
NOW THEN TO DECORATE THE LID 
JUST POP THAT ON THERE 
WE NEED SOME PAPER 
AND I'M GOING TO PUT MY LID ON TOP OF THE PAPER 
GET A PEN AND DRAW AROUND ALL THE WAY AROUND 
THE TIN LID 
NOW THEN 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHAPE THAT IS 
A CIRCLE 
NOW WE NEED TO CUT AROUND THE CIRCLE THAT WE'VE DRAWN 
WE CUT ON THE INSIDE AND YOU MIGHT NEED SOME HELP WITH THIS 
IT'S QUITE TRICKY REALLY 
SOON I CAN BE REALLY NOISY 
NEARLY THERE 
CUTTING CUTTING CUTTING 
THERE 
POP THAT TO ONE SIDE 
NOW THEN WE NEED TO STICK 
OUR RED CIRCLE TO THE TOP OF THE TIN 
SO GET SOME MORE GLUE

ALL AROUND THERE SOME GLUE IN THE MIDDLE AS WELL 
SO IT'S NICE AND STUCK DOWN 
AND THERE WE ARE 
THE TOP OF THE DRUM 
IS DECORATED 
NOW THE EXCITING PART
