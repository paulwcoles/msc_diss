THEY'RE KEEN TO GET ON THE PROPERTY LADDER AND BUY A PLACE OF THEIR OWN 
ANNE WORKS AS AN OFFICE MANAGER IN BIRMINGHAM AND PETE IS A BUILDER 
BOTH VERY DIFFERENT CAREERS BUT THEY DO HAVE A FEW HOBBIES IN COMMON 
THEY BOTH LIKE SOCIALISING TRIPS TO THE CINEMA AND PARTYING 
A COUPLE AFTER MY OWN HEART 
PETE CAN I ASK DO YOU THINK KRIS LOOKS LIKE HE'S IN SCHOOL UNIFORM

O. K. 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT BUILDERS THIS IS LIKE GROUNDHOG DAY FOR ME 
EVERY TIME I'VE HAD A BUILDER WORKING HE'S ALWAYS IN THE KITCHEN DRINKING TEA 
HERE WE ARE DRINKING TEA 
IT'S PART OF THE UNION YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THREE TEAS BEFORE YOU START ANY WORK IT'S IN THE UNION RULES 
FOR US TO FIND THE PERFECT PROPERTY WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF PERSONALITY YOU HAVE 
I'M REALLY FUN LOVING UP FOR IT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE DANCING

IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA RAIN I'LL DO THE AGENTS 
I'LL HANG OUT IN THE STREET AND SPEAK TO THE LOCALS IN THE RAIN 
IF ANNE AND PETE WERE LOOKING OUTSIDE HALL GREEN ON THEIR BUDGET OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY GRAND

IT'S VERY SMART CHIC AND DESIRABLE AND A STEAL AT 
HALL GREEN IS A VERY POPULAR RESIDENTIAL AREA 
IN THE SOUTH EAST OF BIRMINGHAM AND IT'S ON THE EDGE OF SOLIHULL 
IT'S AN INTERESTING MIX OF HISTORICAL HOUSING LOCAL SHOPS AND GREEN SPACES 
IT EVEN HAS ITS OWN GREYHOUND STADIUM WHICH HAS BEEN OPEN SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN 
HALL GREEN HAS ITS VERY OWN HALL OF FAME 
THREE WELL KNOWN PEOPLE HAVE LIVED HERE MORE ABOUT THAT LATER 
THE RIVER COLE RUNS THROUGH THE AREA AND THE COLE VALLEY IS NOW A CONSERVATION AREA 
WHICH MAKES THIS A DESIRABLE LOCATION FOR ANNE AND PETE 
BUT THAT DOES MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT ON THE EXPENSIVE SIDE 
QUITE A CHALLENGE ON THEIR BUDGET 
WELL IT DIDN'T RAIN SO I WENT OUT TO FIND WHETHER THE HALL GREEN LOCALS KNEW ABOUT THEIR FAMOUS NEIGHBOURS 
WHILE HE DID THAT I POKED MY NOSE AROUND A FEW ESTATE AGENTS' WINDOWS

POSSIBLY COULD DO WITH A LITTLE BIT OF UPGRADING 
A LITTLE BIT LOOK AT THE CARPET YOU'VE GOT TWO LITTLE WINNERS THERE 
VERY SMOOTH VERY GOOD INDEED 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT WE DO WORK QUITE HARD FOR OUR MONEY 
TODAY WE'VE BEEN SO LUCKY FINDING ALL OUR PROPERTIES WE'VE FOUND A BIT OF SPARE TIME FOR SOME R. AND AMP R. 
I'VE COME UP WITH A LITTLE WINNER 
IT'S IN YARDLEY WOOD I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THE FRONT ONLY 
HAVE A LITTLE LOOK AT THAT 
THE REASON I'M NOT GONNA SHOW YOU THE BACK COULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT 
IT'S SHOCKING BUT IT DOES HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIAL IT'S AWFUL 
MEANWHILE MY CHOICE RIGHT ON CUE 
I FEEL LIKE I'VE POTTED THE BLACK WITH THIS ONE 
IT'S A GREAT PROPERTY SLIGHTLY CONTROVERSIAL 
CONTEMPORARY CHOICE NOT IN THEIR DESIRED LOCATION I'M STILL BACKING IT 
I'M GLAD YOU MOVED THAT BECAUSE IT'S MY SHOT WOULD YOU INTRODUCE PROPERTY NUMBER THREE 
PROPERTY NUMBER THREE IS OUR JOINT CHOICE 
IT'S CUTE ADORABLE AND THEY'RE GONNA BE SEDUCED BY IT 
A LITTLE BIT LIKE ME IN THIS GAME IT'S A WINNER 
ANNE AND PETE WANTED A REAL PROJECT AND BY JOVE I'VE GIVEN THEM ONE 
THIS THREE BEDROOM SEMI IS CRYING OUT FOR SOME T. L. C. TO TURN IT FROM UNLOVED TO DES RES 
HANG ON IT'S NOT ACTUALLY IN HALL GREEN 
IT'S JUST AROUND THE CORNER IN YARDLEY WOOD STILL A POPULAR LOCATION I HAVE TO ADMIT 
IT IS IN SOUTH BIRMINGHAM WHICH THEY DID WANT 
IT'S MY CHOICE AND IF THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A BARGAIN TO RENOVATE THIS ONE IS RIGHT UP PETE'S STREET 
ANNIE AND PETE LET ME TELL YOU WHY THE HOUSE I'VE FOUND 
I THINK IS NIGH ON PERFECT 
STRUCTURALLY IT'S VERY SOUND 
YOU DID SAY YOU DON'T WANNA DO ANYTHING MAJOR 
INTERNALLY IT IS A DISASTER 
THE DECOR IS ATROCIOUS AWFUL CARPETS AWFUL WALLPAPER 
YOU WILL LIKEN IT TO KRIS'S DRESS SENSE LOOK AT IT 
O. I. YOU DID SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING MAJOR YOU JUST WANTED TO DO A BIT OF DECOR 
THAT'LL BE FINE WHAT ABOUT YOU ANNIE 
STRAIGHT AWAY I'M NOT KEEN ON THE OUTSIDE DECOR THE COLOUR WHITE MAYBE THAT COULD BE CHANGED 
YOU COULD PAINT IT GREEN OR TOFFEE COLOUR TO MATCH THE COLOUR OF DOM'S TEETH IT'S A VISUAL EXPERIENCE 
IT'S AN INTRIGUING TRIP GO FOR IT GO GO GO 
MOCKING MY DRESS SENSE HOW DARE YOU 
WE COULD BE IN TROUBLE THEY MIGHT LIKE THAT DECOR THAT'S A POINT 
I WAS A BIT CONFUSED AT THE START AS TO WHICH ONE IS THE BOSS I THINK WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT 
I'VE GOT MY GUT FEELING ALREADY 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF I LIKE THE CARPET IT'S A BIT PURPLE ISN'T IT 
DISCOURTEOUS REMARKS BEING MADE ABOUT THE CARPET 
OH DEFINITELY NOT IT'S GOT TO GO 
IT'S QUITE SQUARE I LIKE THE SQUARE IT'S A REASONABLE SIZE 
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SPACE AND ERGONOMICS A SQUARE ROOM IS THE BEST ROOM FOR FURNITURE 
THE RADIATOR'S IN THE WRONG SPOT FOR A SETTEE ISN'T IT YES 
MAYBE PUT THE RADIATOR THERE PERHAPS 
HE'S REORGANISING THE CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEM 
I WONDER WHAT THE PULL CORD'S ALL ABOUT 
THEY'LL PULL THE CORD STRAIGHT OUT OF THE SOCKET AND THERE'LL BE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THAT 
WHAT'S THAT CUPBOARD ANNIE 
THAT'S THE BUILDER HE'S LOOKING FOR HIS TEA BAGS 
THAT'S GOOD STORAGE SPACE 
THAT'S HANDY SPACE IT IS I QUITE LIKE THAT 
IF YOU WERE NAUGHTY I COULD LOCK YOU THERE IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK 
DO YOU THINK SHE'S THE BRAINS AND HE'S THE MUSCLE NO I THINK SHE'S THE BRAINS AND THE MUSCLE REALLY 
YES FACE FACTS HE MANICURES 
A NICE SIZE KITCHEN 
YEAH IDEAL SIZE 
A LOT OF WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE 
A LOT OF WORK NEEDS DOING 
THAT'S NOT SO TRUE IT'S A NEW KITCHEN 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE LAYOUT 
I LIKE THE COLOUR OF THE UNITS APART FROM THAT THE COLOUR IS LOVELY IT'S ALL WRONG 
YOU'D HAVE TO RECONFIGURE 
MAYBE GET SOMETHING OVER HERE BUT YOU'VE GOT A RADIATOR IN THE WAY 
THE PIPES ARE ALL EXPOSED PETE IS OBSESSED WITH RADIATORS AND PIPES 
THAT'S THE BUILDER COMING OUT IS THAT WHAT IT IS YEAH 
NICE SIZE GARDEN I THINK YOU COULD USE THE SPACE 
PROBABLY EXTEND OUT YOU YOU CAN DIG THE FOUNDATIONS 
YOU CAN BUILD THE EXTENSION YES 
AND I'LL BE JIGGING AROUND IN THE BACKGROUND 
RIGHT O. K. 
THE DECOR AGAIN IF THIS IS THE SMALL BEDROOM 
IT'S BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 
THAT'S A VERY LARGE BOX A BIG BOX 
A HUGE BOX SHALL WE JUST HAVE A LOOK OUT OVER HERE 
LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN SEE 
A COUPLE OF MONKEYS IN THE GARDEN MONKEY 
WE DO GET PAID PEANUTS WE DO 
M. M. M. BANANA I'VE GOT MY OWN THANKS O. K. 
THIS IS ALL WASTE LAND YEAH 
WE COULD PERHAPS GET A MACHINE OFF THE ROAD AROUND THE BACK 
TAKE A BIT OF THAT FENCING DOWN 
WE COULD DO A LOT OF THAT WORK WITH A MINI DIGGER 
I'D CHANGE ALL THE DECOR UP THERE 
I'D MOVE THE RADIATOR MYSELF 
I DON'T THINK THEY'VE THOUGHT ABOUT MOVING THE RADIATORS 
LET'S GO NEXT DOOR AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON 
M. M. M. 
AGAIN THE DECORATING IS THE DECORATING DISMAL THE CARPET DISMAL IT'S JUST SO DEPRESSING 
I MEAN IT'S A REAL PUNCH IN THE GUT 
IT'S VIOLENT PATTERNS AND COLOURS 
I THINK YOU'D STRUGGLE TO GET THE BED ANYWHERE ELSE TO BE HONEST 
THE RADIATORS ARE IN THE WRONG PLACES 
HE'S MENTIONED THE RADIATOR AGAIN THIS MUST BE 
A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE QUITE A BIT OF CUPBOARD SPACE 
NOT TOO BAD NOT TOO BAD YEAH 
THEY'RE DOING WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE MAKING CONSTRUCTIVE COMMENTS ABOUT THE ENTIRE PROPERTY 
IT'S JUST HORRIBLE I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL 
DEFINITELY AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE FOR CUPBOARDS THERE IS 
THIS IS A NICE SIZE ROOM IT IS A NICE SIZE ROOM 
I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE DIFFICULT TO GET THE RADIATOR BACK TO BACK 
THE PLUMBING'S THERE 
RADIATORS AGAIN 
WHAT IS IT WITH HIM AND RADIATORS 
WHERE WOULD YOU PUT THE BED 
YOU CAN'T PUT IT THERE ANNE NO 
I THINK IT WOULD GO BETTER AGAINST THE BACK WALL POSSIBLY THERE 
THIS IS VERY ENCOURAGING THEY'RE PLANNING THE ROOM WORKING OUT WHERE THE FURNITURE IS GONNA GO 
WARDROBE THERE RADIATOR IN THERE DOM THIS COULD BE A ONE HOUSE HUNT 
OH SHOCK HORROR THIS IS AWFUL 
OH IT'S AWFUL DOMINIC WAS RIGHT 
I DON'T THINK THAT BATHROOM IS ACTUALLY THAT BAD 
IT LOOKS A BIT SCARY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BUT WITH A LITTLE SLIGHT MAKEOVER IT WILL BE REJUVENATED 
IF ONLY EVERYTHING IN LIFE WAS LIKE THAT IT NEEDS GUTTING DOESN'T IT TOTALLY THIS IS JUST AWFUL 
THIS IS ABOUT SECOND WORLD WAR SECOND WORLD WAR I THINK THAT'S DOING IT A FAVOUR 
IT'S NOT THAT BAD IT'S NOT THAT BAD 
OH COME ON IT'S GOT A CAST IRON BATH IN THERE AND A LAVVY 
LET'S FIND THE BOYS AND TELL THEM WHAT A TERRIBLE HOUSE THEY'VE FOUND FOR US LET'S GO 
DOMINIC I AM ENCOURAGED BY THEIR OPTIMISM LET'S ENCOURAGE THEM MORE 
I'M ENCOURAGED BY YOURS ALL OF A SUDDEN THANK YOU 
AND QUITE RIGHTLY SO YOU AND ME YOU ABSOLUTELY HATED THAT BATHROOM DIDN'T YOU 
ABSOLUTELY IT'S AWFUL 
YOU SAID IT LOOKED LIKE WORLD WAR TWO IT DOES 
AWFUL TERRIBLE KRISTIAN LIKED IT 
HONESTLY HE WOULD HE WOULD WOULDN'T HE 
THIS IS THE SMALLEST OF THE THREE BEDROOMS IT'S STILL A GOOD SIZE 
THIS TO ME WOULD BE AN IDEAL ROOM TO TURN INTO A FAMILY BATHROOM 
FIRST OF ALL THE WINDOW IS SITTING FAR TOO LOW TO GET A BATH UNDERNEATH THAT'S NOT A BIG JOB 
GET THE WINDOW TAKEN OUT GET THE WALL BUILT UP AND A SMALLER WINDOW THERE WITH FROSTED GLASS 
YOU DON'T WANT ANYONE LOOKING IN WHEN YOU'RE BATHING 
YOU GET A NICE BATH PUT IN THERE IN THIS CORNER 
I WOULD STICK IN A CORNER SHOWER 
THAT'S A REALLY REALLY NICE CORNER SHOWER YOU'VE GOT TONS OF ROOM 
THE DOORS OPEN UP THE BATH'S OVER THERE 
YOU HAVE A CHOICE HERE YOU COULD HAVE YOUR SINK HERE 
OR SOMETHING WHICH I KNOW IS VERY CLOSE TO YOU AND PETE'S HEART IS RADIATORS 
YOU HAVEN'T STOPPED MENTIONING THEM MOVE THAT AND YOU COULD STICK THE SINK THERE AM I A GENIUS 
YOU ARE 
PETE I HAVE TO SAY I WAS VERY VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOU AND ANNE AS WELL 
WHEN YOU LOOKED AROUND THE HOUSE YOU DIDN'T RECALL TOO MUCH OF THE DECOR I KNOW I KNOW 
IT'S NOT PRETTY IT'S NOT PRETTY 
I FEEL IT MAKES YOU SLIGHTLY GIDDY WHEN YOU FIRST WALK IN 
IT'S A BIT LIKE THAT 
IN TERMS OF YOU BUYING THIS PROPERTY I THINK IT'S SPOT ON AND THERE IS LOADS OF SPACE HERE 
BUT IT'S YOUR DECISION DO YOU THINK IT'S 
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS GOING FOR IT REALLY MORE SO THAN WHAT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WHEN WE CAME IN 
THE ROOMS ARE REALLY A NICE SIZE UPSTAIRS IS GOOD AS WELL 
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM IN THE BACK 
DEPENDING ON IF WE BOUGHT AND HOW LONG WE INTENDED TO STAY THERE'S PLENTY WE COULD DO WITH IT 
YOU'VE GOT AN OBSESSION WITH RADIATORS I LIKE MOVING RADIATORS 
YOU DO JUST MOVE THEM AROUND EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS 
WELL YOU KNOW MOVE THE BED SO YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE THE RADIATORS 
FAIR ENOUGH IT DEPENDS HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'VE GOT LEFT 
O. K. LET'S TALK ABOUT MONEY 
HE'S HEARD THE WORD MONEY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED LIKE A FERRET I WAS 
RIGHT GUESS THE PRICE TIME 
YOU KNOW THE SCORE WHAT WE'LL ASK YOU TO DO IS GUESS THE PRICE 
BOTH OF YOU INDIVIDUALLY 
WE'LL SEE WHO'S CLOSEST AT THE END OF THE DAY 
THE WINNER GETS TO HAVE DINNER WITH KRISTIAN ONE NIGHT 
AND THE LOSER GETS TO HAVE DINNER WITH KRISTIAN TWO NIGHTS THIS WEEK SO THERE IS A LOT TO PLAY FOR 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE NO ANSWER AND NO RETORT TO THAT AT ALL 
O. K. RIGHT WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST OR SECOND ANNIE I WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST 
I THINK ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
O. K. OVER TO YOU PETE 
I WOULD SAY NOT TOO FAR AHEAD OF THAT BUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
INTERESTINGLY YOU ARE CLOSEST 
THE PRICE IS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY DELIBERATELY LOSING TO HAVE TWO NIGHTS OF DINNER WITH ME I CAN SEE THE PLAN IS WORKING 
BUT LISTEN YOU COULD LOSE THE NEXT ONE AS WELL 
PROPERTY NUMBER TWO IS A JOINT CHOICE COME THIS WAY 
BUT BEFORE WE GET TO NUMBER TWO A FEW MORE WORDS ABOUT NUMBER ONE 
IF ANNE AND PETE WANTED TO THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM 
IN THAT CUPBOARD UNDER THE STAIRS TO MAKE A STUDY OR COMPUTER AREA 
WITH THE WALL STILL IN PLACE OR KNOCKED OUT TO INCREASE THE SPACE IN THE LOUNGE 
THIS GARDEN'S DESCRIBED ON THE AGENT'S DETAILS AS EASY TO MAINTAIN 
BUT IF THEY WANTED TO LANDSCAPE IT IT WOULD COST ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
BUT A CHEAPER OPTION WOULD BE TO REMOVE CERTAIN SECTIONS OF SLAB 
AND ADD PLANTING OR POTS OF COLOUR TO SOFTEN THAT SEVERE LOOK 
WELL WE REALLY HAVE WAVED OUR MAGIC WANDS WITH PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
JUST CHECK OUT THIS LOVELY PERIOD HOUSE ON A WELL ESTABLISHED TREE LINED STREET 
AND GUESS WHAT IT'S SLAP BANG IN THE MIDDLE OF HALL GREEN WITH THAT DESIRABLE B. TWENTY EIGHT POSTCODE 
YOU KNOW WE'RE ON THE MONEY WITH THIS ONE KRIS LET'S SEE WHAT ANNE AND PETE THINK OF OUR JOINT CHOICE 
NOW KRISTIAN AND I WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER WHEN WE FOUND YOU HOUSE NUMBER TWO 
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT IT POSTCODE B. TWENTY EIGHT 
ANYBODY WHO'S FROM THE WEST MIDLANDS AS YOU ARE 
WOULD KNOW THAT B. TWENTY EIGHT IS A VERY DESIRABLE PLACE TO LIVE 
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO PAY A PRICE FOR THAT COMPARED TO MY ONE 
AND YOU LOSE A BEDROOM IT'S ONLY GOT TWO 
IS THAT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE I DON'T THINK SO NO WE CAN LIVE WITH IT 
THIS HOUSE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST HOUSES BUILT IN THE AREA 
IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS BY A BUILDER WHO BUILT MANY OTHER HOUSES AROUND HERE 
WHEN DOES A BUILDER BUILD A BAD HOME FOR HIMSELF ALL THE TIME NO NO NEVER 
NEVER NEVER NEVER SO HOPEFULLY IT WILL GUARANTEE YOU A SOLID WELL BUILT PROPERTY 
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO IMPLY HERE BUT IT'S NOT SINKING IN IS IT 
YOU GET YOURSELVES INTO THAT HOUSE 
TELL US WHAT YOU THINK 
THAT WAS LIKE A TONGUE TWISTER YOU DONE WELL MATE 
DOMINIC LET'S POP THE HEADPHONES ON AND SEE WHAT THEY MAKE OF IT 
IT'S NICE AND BRIGHT 
I LIKE THAT TOUCH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TOUCHING BUT SHE LIKES THE TOUCH 
THIS IS NICE I REALLY LIKE IT 
HOW LONG TILL HE MENTIONS THE RADIATORS WHAT DO YOU RECKON HIS TIME STARTS NOW 
I LIKE THE FLOORBOARDS SOMEBODY'S MISSING A DOOR I'M SURE WE CAN REMEDY THAT 
AND THE RADIATOR'S NOT BIG ENOUGH THERE IT IS DIDN'T TAKE LONG 
GOT NO HEAT IN HERE ONLY THAT LITTLE RADIATOR NICE FEATURE THERE 
WITH THAT FIRE GOING IT'LL BE NICE AND COSY 
THIS IMMEDIATELY ATTRACTS ME 
COMPACT BUT EVERYTHING YOU NEED NICE AND SPACIOUS 
REALLY REALLY NICE AGAIN A NICE KITCHEN HERE 
NICE SHAPE LOVELY QUARRY TILES ON THE FLOOR 
JUST JUST IT FEELS VERY HOMELY 
I REALLY LIKE IT NICE WORK SURFACE AREA HERE 
A NICE COOKER AREA 
LOOKS NICE OUT THE BACK AS WELL 
SHE KEEPS SAYING THIS IS NICE THIS IS NICE BUT TO ME THAT'S SLICED WHITE BREAD 
THAT'S A REALLY BLAND JUST MAKING A COMMENT FOR THE SAKE OF IT 
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT POKY YES IT IS A BIT IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK 
I ACTUALLY THINK LEAN TO'S LIKE THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS GET RID OF IT COMPLETELY 
THAT'S NOT A LEAN TO THAT'S A FALLING OVER IT IS 
IT'S NOT A LOT OF USE AT THE MOMENT IT'S NOT A LOT OF USE BUT PETE 
PETE WOULD YOU MOVE THE RADIATOR I CAN'T SEE A RADIATOR 
WHERE WOULD YOU PUT THE RADIATOR ANOTHER QUESTION YOU COULD PUT ONE IN THERE 
PUT A RADIATOR AND THEN TAKE IT OUT AGAIN ANOTHER QUESTION 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET RID OF IT THE RADIATOR 
NO THE WHOLE THING THE HOUSE 
NO NOT THE HOUSE THE LEAN TO 
KEEP THE RADIATORS AND GET RID OF THE LEAN TO 
I THINK IT ALL HAS TO GO IT HAS TO GO OR BE REBUILT 
RIGHT THEY'RE GOING IN AGAIN FAKE THE SMILE ONE TWO THREE 
RIGHT THEY'VE GONE YOU CAN RELAX 
RIGHT OH THIS IS QUITE A NICE SIZE BEDROOM LOVELY ISN'T IT 
IT'S NICE NICE AND BRIGHT AS WELL NICE AND SIMPLE DECOR 
I HATE IT WOULD BE BETTER THAN NICE 
POSSIBLY 
I DON'T THINK YOU COULD DO MUCH TO IT NOT A LOT YOU CAN DO AND THE RADIATOR'S IN THE WRONG SPOT 
THE RADIATOR'S ACTUALLY PERFECT OH WELL THERE YOU GO 
OH NO RADIATORS AGAIN 
NO BUT IT'S IN THE RIGHT SPOT DOMINIC NO HE'D STILL MOVE IT 
SHALL WE GO AND HAVE A NOSE IN HERE AND SEE WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT 
MIGHT BE SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THERE 
WELL IT'S FULL OF RUBBISH JUST LIKE OURS WOULD BE 
IF WE HAD THAT NOW IT WOULD BE DEFINITELY FULL OF RUBBISH 
LET'S FACE FACTS THEY WANTED A HOUSE WITH VERY LITTLE WORK 
TWO THREE BEDROOMS AND A NICE KITCHEN 
DELIVERED 
ON THE DOORMAT ON THE NOSE 
OH DON'T TEMPT ME DON'T TEMPT ME DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN 
YOU COULDN'T REACH THAT HIGH I'D JUMP UP AND BITE YOUR KNEECAPS 
THIS IS THE OTHER ROOM 
OH YES THERE'S ONLY THE TWO 
MORE OR LESS THE SAME SIZE YES HAVE YOU NOTICED THE HIGH CEILINGS 
NICE SMOOTH WALLS HE'S DONE A NICE JOB IN THE PLASTERING 
OH I LOVE THAT WHEN A BUILDER PASSES JUDGMENT ON ANOTHER MAN'S WORK 
YEAH HE'S DONE AN ALL RIGHT JOB THE BOY DID GOOD 
SO WE'RE HAPPY WITH THE BED THERE IT'S JUST WHERE WE PUT THE WARDROBES 
I THINK POSSIBLY 
ABOUT HERE 
ALONG THIS WALL YES YOU'D GET A NARROW ONE IN THERE 
THEY'RE PUTTING A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO IT DOMINIC 
IT'S PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE 
THEY DID IT IN THE LAST HOUSE AND THEY'RE DOING IT AGAIN HERE I RESPECT THAT RUBBISH 
WHERE WOULD YOU PUT A WARDROBE IT'S A PROBLEM THEY'RE TALKING THEMSELVES OUT OF IT 
WOW LOOK AT THIS BATH IT'S GREAT 
WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE BATH FOR TWO BLOWING BUBBLES SO ROMANTIC 
AH HOW ROMANTIC A BATH WITH BUBBLES 
IT'S A NICE LONG BATHROOM 
IT'S A NICE SHAPE ACTUALLY 
A BIT UNUSUAL 
IT IS NICE DOMINIC IT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN BUT I THINK WE HAVE READ THIS WRONG 
WHEN WE THOUGHT THEY WERE BEING MEDIOCRE ABOUT THE HOUSE THEY WERE BEING OVERWHELMED 
YOU SPEAK ENTIRELY FOR YOURSELF WE HAVE NOT READ THIS WRONG 
I STILL THINK THEY DO NOT LIKE THAT HOUSE I THINK THEY DO TRUST ME 
I LIKE THE HOUSE AND I GET A GOOD VIBE FROM IT I REALLY LIKE IT 
PLEASE ADMIT YOU ARE WRONG NO NO I WOULD ADMIT I WAS WRONG IF I WAS EVER WRONG 
TELL ME WHAT DOES IT FEELS LIKE 
IT FEELS LIKE THE FEELING YOU SHOULD BE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW 
QUITE FRANKLY I'M GOING IN TO CHAT TO THEM 
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT FIRST THINGS FIRST 
THAT LEAN TO WHICH REALLY SHOULD BE CALLED A FALLING OVER IT'S ROTTEN IT'S GOTTA GO 
PULL THE THING DOWN GET RID OF IT 
IF YOU LOOK ON THAT SIDE THEY'VE BUILT UP 
THE FACT THAT THEY'VE EXTENDED AT THE BACK WOULD ALMOST GIVE YOU CARTE BLANCHE TO DO THE SAME THING 
DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM EVEN A THIRD BEDROOM IF YOU NEED IT 
AND SOMETHING I KNOW IS A BIG ISSUE ACCESS 
AND BECAUSE IT'S MID TERRACED 
YOU'D ACTUALLY THINK THERE WASN'T ANY SIDE ACCESS BUT THERE IS 
YOU HAVE A RIGHT OF WAY AS EVERYBODY WHO LIVES HERE DOES 
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE GOT THESE GATES 
IF YOU COME WITH ME YOU'VE ONLY GOT ONE HOUSE BETWEEN YOU AND NEXT DOOR 
AND THERE IS YOUR SIDE ENTRANCE THAT'S VERY HANDY 
YOU'RE ALLOWED YOU'RE IN YOUR PERFECT RIGHTS TO GO IN AND CARRY ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT TO THERE 
I WOULDN'T HAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT IT 
ANNIE I WANT SOME CLARIFICATION FROM YOU BECAUSE DOMINIC IS CONVINCED THAT YOU DON'T LIKE THIS HOUSE 
AND I THINK YOU DO I GET A REALLY GOOD VIBE FROM IT 
YOU GET A GOOD VIBE FROM IT AND WHAT ABOUT PETE I THINK HE DOES AS WELL ALL RIGHT 
BECAUSE THAT'S A GOOD THING I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC HOUSE 
I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE ROOF HAS BEEN REDONE IT'S BEEN BOARDED OUT UP THERE 
INSULATION HAS BEEN DONE IN FACT A WHOLE LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE 
IN A REALLY NICE PERIOD WAY 
YOU'VE STILL GOT THE QUARRY TILES THE COLOURS ARE NICE 
THE STRIPPED PINE DOORS 
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO CARRY ON THAT SENSE OF AUTHENTICITY 
OH YES ABSOLUTELY YOU WOULD 
THEY'VE DONE SO MUCH WITH IT IT NEEDS FRESHENING UP HERE AND THERE 
BUT IT WON'T EAT INTO TOO MUCH OF YOUR BUDGET THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING ANYWAY 
IT'S A BRASS MONKEY OUT THERE YOU LOOK LIKE A MONKEY 
RIGHT O. K. IT IS GUESS THE PRICE TIME YOU'VE SEEN THE PROPERTY 
DO YOU LIKE THE HOUSE I DO YEAH 
THEY BOTH SEEM TO LIKE THE HOUSE WHAT A SURPRISE 
THEY'RE BOTH BEING POLITE HE'S NEVER BEEN WRONG 
RIGHT O. K. YOU WERE THE CLOSEST TO THE PRICE ON THE LAST PROPERTY 
WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST 
DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST OH ANNIE HEY RIGHT GO ON 
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSE TO OUR MAXIMUM I WOULD SAY ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
DID YOU HEAR THAT I'M NOT THAT FAR AWAY COURSE I HEARD IT 
AND I THINK IT WILL BE ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WELL YOU MIGHT BOTH BE IN FOR A BIT OF A SHOCK IT'S ACTUALLY FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
OH SORRY PETE THAT'S AN ESTIMATE 
OH NO LISTEN DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
YOU'RE SPOT ON ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY WELL DONE YOU 
ON THE NOSE THAT MEANS IF YOU KEEP GOING LIKE THIS YOU WILL WIN 
AND YOU MIGHT ONLY HAVE TO HAVE ONE DATE WITH KRISTIAN NOT TWO 
AH THAT'S NOT GOOD 
WE WANTED THE TWO NIGHTS DIDN'T WE 
WE WANTED THE TWO NIGHTS TOGETHER COME ON PETE 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT GETS BETTER MY HOUSE NEXT CHOICE COME ON 
HOW STRANGE SHE SEEMS AMAZINGLY PLEASED WITH THAT 
POOR GIRL IF ANNE AND PETE WERE TO INVEST IN THIS FANTASTIC PROPERTY 
THEY MIGHT LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THE FOLLOWING THINGS 
THAT OUTSIDE LAVATORY CAN BE QUITE HANDY IN LONG SUMMERS IN THE GARDEN 
BUT BEFORE THEY USE IT I RECOMMEND THEY CLEAR THE JUNK OFF THE SEAT 
AND AS THE HOUSE IS TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY TO CONTINUE WITH THE RESTORATION 
BUT TO KEEP THE COSTS DOWN 
THEY SHOULD CONSIDER GOING TO RECLAMATION YARDS 
WELL WITH PROPERTY THREE I'M TRANSPORTING ANNE AND PETE OUT OF THE SUBURBS 
AND INTO THE VIBRANT CITY CENTRE AND BIRMINGHAM'S FAMOUS JEWELLERY QUARTER 
HANG ON DO YOU REALLY THINK YOUR CHOICE OF AN APARTMENT IN THE CITY CENTRE IS GOING TO FLOAT THEIR BOAT 
WELL WITH ANNE WORKING IN TOWN AND THEIR LOVE OF SOCIALISING 
I RECKON HAVING THE CITY ON THEIR DOORSTEP WILL BE A GREAT IDEA 
EVEN IF THEY DON'T KNOW IT YET 
NOW ANNIE AND PETE CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION GO FOR IT YEAH 
DO YOU TRUST ME COURSE I DO YEAH ABSOLUTELY 
YOU SAY YES THAT'S TWO PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD THEN KRIS 
I HAVE TO SAY MAYBE IN THIS INSTANCE YOU'RE BEING SLIGHTLY FOOLISH 
THE THIRD CHOICE THE WILD CARD MY CHOICE IS A LITTLE BIT LEFT OF CENTRE 
BECAUSE I'M NOT SHOWING YOU A HOUSE I'M NOT SHOWING YOUR DESIRED AREA I'M SHOWING YOU AN APARTMENT RIGHT 
EVERYONE'S GONE VERY STERN 
BASICALLY IT'S FIVE MINUTES FROM THE CENTRE OF BIRMINGHAM 
IN A VERY FANTASTIC AND GLAMOROUS AREA AND IT IS APARTMENT LIVING 
CITY LIVING WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I DON'T KNOW IT WOULDN'T IMPRESS ME MUCH NO 
NO BASICALLY NO WELL THEY'RE SO OPEN MINDED I LOVE IT LOVE IT 
HE'S GOT YOU AN APARTMENT WE'LL HAVE A LOOK BY ALL MEANS 
IS ONE OF THE REASONS YOU'RE SAYING NO BECAUSE APARTMENT 
PARKING PROBLEMS TOOLS IN THE VAN THAT SORT OF THING SURE YEAH 
WITH THIS APARTMENT YOU GET SECURED PARKING 
IT'S BEHIND GATES YOU CAN ONLY GET WITH A CODE 
SO THE VEHICLE WILL BE SAFE 
IT'S BETTER IN SOME WAYS THAN CARTING STUFF THROUGH THE HOUSE 
THAT WOULD CHEESE YOU OFF WOULDN'T IT IT WOULD YEAH I'M FAILING 
YOU ARE FAILING COME ON ANNE GIVE HIM A CHANCE 
I'M NOT EVEN SURE IT'S A GOOD IDEA AND IT WAS MY CHOICE 
IN SHAKIN' STEVENS STYLE GO AND LOOK BEHIND THAT GREEN DOOR SEE WHAT YOU THINK 
I THINK MUCH MISERY AWAITS 
I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE HERE LONG HEADPHONES COME ON 
YOU BEING IN YOUR EARLY THIRTIES YOU WON'T REMEMBER SHAKIN' STEVENS 
ME BEING IN MY EARLY THIRTIES IS THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID 
OH I STRUCK A RAW NERVE GET YOUR HEADPHONES ON YOU BEING IN YOUR EARLY FORTIES THEN OUTRAGEOUS 
I'M ONLY THIRTY TEN 
OH LAMINATE FLOORS WOOD FLOORS THERE'S A LITTLE CUPBOARD 
A HALF CUPBOARD LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
YOU WALK STRAIGHT INTO THE PORCH AND A BIT OF STORAGE SPACE 
THIS IS A BIT OF A MAZE 
A LITTLE BIT OF A MAZE ROOMS LAID OUT 
IT'S SO CLEAN SO MODERN AND SO CHIC IT'S EVERYTHING YOU'D EXPECT FROM A NEW BUILD APARTMENT 
I THINK THE BATHROOM IS A TAD SMALL FOR MY LIKING 
BUT LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IT'S ONE OF THOSE LOVELY RADIATORS REAL MODERN ISN'T IT 
IT'S GOT PROPER TEXTURE HEY THE RADIATOR'S IN THE RIGHT SPOT 
MARVELLOUS I LIKE THE TILES THE TILES ARE LOVELY THE TILES ARE NICE YEAH VERY WHITE THOUGH 
IT'S LIKE A HOSPITAL ISN'T IT 
STERILE STERILE 
VERY VERY STRANGE DESCRIPTION 
I THINK THE WORD HE MEANS IS NEUTRAL IT'S NEUTRAL 
THE SMALLER ROOM 
THE FLOORS RUN THROUGHOUT YES I LIKE THAT THAT IS NICE 
IT'S NICE SHE WANTS TO DO AN IRISH JIG SHE COULD TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER INTO TAP DANCING 
A GOOD SIZE FOR A SMALL ROOM 
IT IS A GOOD SIZE FOR A SMALL ROOM COULD YOU GET A DOUBLE BED IN HERE 
HEY 
IT'S PERFECT THAT IS THE SINGLE MOST TERRIFYING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN 
DO NEVER EVER EVER ATTEMPT TO DANCE IN FRONT OF ME EVER AGAIN 
IT'S HANDY THAT THERE IS THIS ROOM YOU REALLY HAVE TO HAVE IT 
WITH YOUR SNORING YOU'D NEED TO BE IN HERE WOULDN'T YOU 
NO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE YOU NO NO NO YOU 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE IN HERE 
THERE IS NOTHING WORSE THAN SHARING A ROOM WITH SOMEBODY THAT SNORES 
I'VE NEVER HAD TO DO IT I MEAN I SNORE BUT I DON'T HEAR MYSELF 
MY GIRLFRIEND DOESN'T SNORE SHE SHAVES QUITE REGULARLY BUT SHE DOESN'T SNORE MASTER BEDROOM 
I LIKE IT IT'S NICE NICE BIG SIZE 
AGAIN THE LAMINATE FLOORING 
REALLY NICE I LIKE IT YOU WANT A BIT OF COLOUR 
ONCE SOMEBODY MOVES IN THERE PUTS ALL THE CURTAINS UP 
PUTS MORE CUSHIONS AND BOOKS AND C. D.'S AND BRINGS IT TO LIFE IT WILL FEEL MUCH MUCH BETTER 
YES YOU COULD GET YOUR MECCANO SET IN THE CORNER 
WE CAN PUT YOUR COT IN THE CORNER 
WARDROBE LET'S HAVE A BIT OF A NOSE SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE 
I LIKE THIS VERY NICE YOU COULD HAVE A PARTY IN THAT WARDROBE IT'S LOVELY AND BIG 
I THINK HE'S STRETCHING THE LIMITS OF IMAGINATION SLIGHTLY THERE 
THERE'S NOT NARNIA BEHIND THAT DOOR IS THERE IT'S NOT BIG LIKE 
NO IT ISN'T BUT NICE AND SQUARE WHICH IS WHAT I LIKE 
IT'S SORT OF BORING ISN'T IT 
IF I GOT YOU TO DECORATE THAT I'D SEND YOU OUT TO GET SOME SKY HOOKS AND A LONG WEIGHT 
SOME TARTAN PAINT AND 
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN THINK OF NO THAT WILL DO SOME FRESH MATERIAL WOULD BE NICE 
HAVE YOU NOTICED YOU COULD DO A BIT OF DANCING 
COULD DO RIVERDANCE ON THIS 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD WOULDN'T IT THERE SHE GOES THE IRISH JIG 
I'VE WITNESSED IT LIVE IN PERSON AND NOW SHE'S GIVING US ANOTHER RENDITION 
YES THAT'S LOUD ON MY HEADPHONES 
BUT I MEAN YOU'VE GOT NO ROOM AT THE TABLE HAVE YOU 
HOW PRACTICAL IS IT REALLY 
ONE THING THEY NEED TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND ABOUT THIS PROPERTY IS THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE A SEPARATE DINING ROOM 
THAT COULD BE TRICKY THEY LIKE ENTERTAINING 
YOU'VE GOT AN OPEN MIND I CAN SEE RIGHT BETWEEN YOUR EARS 
THE UNITS THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT STRIKES I LIKE THE COLOUR 
YES THE COLOUR IS REALLY NICE 
IT LOOKS VERY CLEAN AND MODERN 
EVERYTHING'S CLEAN AND TIDY THE BOILER'S HIDDEN THE FRIDGE FREEZER'S HIDDEN THE FRIDGE 
NICE FRIDGE I LIKE THAT IT'S TOO WARM YOU COULDN'T PUT YOUR BEER IN THERE 
WELL YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY THEN TOO BAD 
I COULD PUT THEM IN THE FREEZER THOUGH 
IT'S INTERESTING AGAIN SHE'S BEING SEDUCED ALL BY THE MOD CONS 
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT HIS BEER BEING COLD THE KITCHEN IS VERY SMALL IT'S SMALL BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO 
YOU CAN'T EXTEND THE FLAT CAN YOU NO 
JUST PUT A SLOW COOKER IN THE CORNER THROW THE VEG IN AND GO AND DO A JIG IN THE FRONT ROOM 
YOU COULD DANCE IN THE KITCHEN AS WELL I COULD YEAH 
I HAVEN'T GOT A LOT OF ROOM TO DANCE IN THE KITCHEN 
KRIS WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THEY HAVEN'T REALLY DISSED IT 
BUT THEY HAVEN'T FALLEN IN LOVE WITH IT HANGING IN THE BALANCE 
I THINK WE NEED TO PERSUADE THEM WILL YOU HELP ME 
PETE AS YOU KNOW JEWELLERY QUARTER IS QUITE A NICE PLACE TO LIVE 
LOVELY IF YOU GUYS WERE TO MOVE IN ROUND HERE I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU AND THE FUTURE 
MY TIP IS GOING TO MAKE YOU GO WEAK AT THE KNEES AND SLIGHTLY PALE 
BECAUSE MAYBE NOT TODAY MAYBE NOT TOMORROW BUT SOMETIME SOON 
YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE A DECENT WOMAN OF ANNIE YOU SEE 
I KNEW THAT WAS GOING TO SCARE YOU A BIT CLOSE TO THE RINGS HERE I KNOW 
CAN WE MOVE BACK A BIT COME ON COME OVER HERE NO 
ENGAGEMENT RING OR A WEDDING RING IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ONE DAY 
THE GOOD THING IS YOU CAN WALK PAST THIS AND ALL THESE SHOPS EVERY DAY AROUND HERE I'LL KEEP WALKING 
SHE'LL GO OH I LOVE THAT RING 
IF YOU ARE A DECENT CHAP YOU'D BE NOTING THAT GO IN 
PAY YOUR MONEY AND HAVE THE RING AND THEN DO SOMETHING REALLY ROMANTIC GO DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND SAY 
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT HAPPENING NO YOU CAN'T I TRIED MY HARDEST COME ON 
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS WHICH I THINK ARE GOOD FOR BOTH OF YOU 
FIRSTLY FOR YOU IF YOU LOOK UP THERE YOU'LL NOTICE THEY'VE GOT METAL LIGHT SWITCHES 
WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR JIG YOU WON'T BE BREAKING THEM 
IS THAT WHAT HE TOLD YOU YEP 
WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF HIM ABSOLUTE NONSENSE 
HE BROKE IT WHEN HE WAS DRUNK 
DID HE CHEEKY MONKEY 
CHEEKY MONKEY IS RIGHT 
SECONDLY JUST LOOK AROUND 
RIGHT NOW YOU ARE SLAP BANG IN THE CENTRE OF BIRMINGHAM CITY CENTRE 
THAT IS THE BIG PLUS DO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE GOT HUNDREDS OF RESTAURANTS BARS CLUBS 
I KNOW YOU ENTERTAIN A LOT AND YOU WANTED THE SPACE TO ENTERTAIN 
YOU DON'T REALLY GET THAT HERE 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HIRE A TABLE IN A RESTAURANT AND TAKE ALL YOUR FRIENDS OUT THERE 
YOU COULD TAKE THEM TO A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT ALMOST EVERY NIGHT OF THE YEAR 
IT'S CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT OPTION TO LOOK AT HAVE I SOLD IT TO YOU 
NOT SURE I DON'T THINK SO 
IT'S SOMETHING TO WEIGH UP 
I'M BACKING THE WRONG HORSE AT THE MOMENT POSSIBLY POSSIBLY 
LET'S SEE IF THE PRICE CHANGES THINGS FOR YOU 
HOLD ON BEFORE WE TALK PRICES LET'S TALK TIPS 
IF ANNE AND PETE LOVE THIS FLAT AFTER ALL THEY SHOULD BEAR IN MIND THIS INFORMATION 
THEY MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW THAT SATELLITE T. V. IS ALREADY FITTED 
WITH A DISH ON THE ROOF AND FEEDS INTO THE APARTMENT 
SO IF IT'S THEIR BAG ALL THEY'D NEED TO BUY IS A RECEIVER 
THOUGH THE PROPERTY PRICE IS WELL WITHIN THEIR BUDGET 
ANNE AND PETE WOULD NEED TO BUDGET FOR GROUND RENT AND SERVICE CHARGES 
WHICH COME TO SEVENTY PER MONTH 
BUT THAT PRICE WOULD INCLUDE PART OWNERSHIP OF THE BUILDING'S FREEHOLD 
SHARED BETWEEN ALL OF THE OCCUPANTS RIGHT CRUNCH TIME 
HERE WE GO IT'S ONE APIECE THE WINNER OF THIS ONE IS THE OVERALL WINNER 
ANNIE YOU'VE GOT THE LOVELIEST SMILE IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST OR SECOND 
I'LL GO FIRST PLEASE FIRE AWAY HOW MUCH FOR THIS APARTMENT OH I THINK ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
O. K. 
NOW I'M CONFUSED I'D SAY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
BIG DIFFERENCE ANNIE WHAT CAN I SAY YOU ARE A COMPLETE LOSER 
BECAUSE THE ACTUAL PRICE IS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND 
HOW MUCH ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND YOUR HEARING'S GOING LOVE 
I THINK THAT'S SHOCK ARE YOU SHOCKED I AM SHOCKED 
BEFORE WE ANALYSE THAT PRICE WE'VE SEEN THREE PROPERTIES 
AND WE HAVE NO MORE TO SHOW YOU AND YOU NEED TO MAKE A DECISION 
THAT'S IT FINITO TO HELP YOU ALONG THE WAY WE'VE PUT PICTURES 
OF ALL THE THREE PROPERTIES THEIR DETAILS AND PRICES ON THIS LAPTOP 
WHO IS THE BRAINS WHEN IT COMES TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
MAINE I THOUGHT SO I'LL GIVE YOU THAT AND ASK YOU TO POP AWAY 
HAVE A LOOK AT IT AT YOUR OWN LEISURE SEE YOU LATER 
OFF YOU GO GUYS BYE 
WHILE THEY ARE OFF DOING THAT AND LOOKING AT THOSE IMAGES LET'S GO AND GET A COFFEE 
HERE'S A QUICK RECAP FOR YOU AT HOME 
WILL THEY GO FOR PROPERTY ONE

GOTTA WARN YOU IT'S NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY 
WE RECOMMEND YOU GET YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT ONE DONE 
OUR SURVEYOR HAS FOUND A COUPLE OF POINTS BUT THEY ARE NOT MAJOR 
ONE OF THEM IS THE SECOND BEDROOM IT HAS A WALL MOUNTED BOILER 
WHAT HE RECOMMENDS IS EITHER MOVE IT UP INTO THE ATTIC 
OR BUILD A CUPBOARD ROUND IT BUT YOU DO NEED TO GET ADVICE ON THAT 
IT HAS TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SPACE TO BREATHE 
O. K. YOU KNOW THAT LOVELY WOODEN FLOOR YEAH 
LOVELY FOR DOING THE IRISH JIG ON 
RIGHT WELL OUR SURVEYOR HAS NOTICED THERE'S ONLY TWO AIR BRICKS AT THE FRONT OF THE PROPERTY 
TO MAKE SURE IT IS BREATHING UNDERNEATH THAT WOODEN FLOOR YOU WANT TO PUT AN EXTRA ONE IN THERE 
BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE IT HAS BEEN INJECTED TO STOP THE DAMP 
GOOD THAT'S BEEN DONE FOR YOU PROS AND CONS ON THE WHOLE A LOVELY HOUSE
