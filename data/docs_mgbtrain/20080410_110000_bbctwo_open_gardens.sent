EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF BRITISH GARDENERS 
TRY DESPERATELY TO GET A PLACE IN THE YELLOW BOOK 
THIS ANNUAL GUIDE PUBLISHED BY THE NATIONAL GARDEN SCHEME 
LISTS PRIVATE GARDENS JUDGED BRILLIANT ENOUGH 
TO BE OPEN FOR CHARITY 
FOR THE FEW LUCKY PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCEPTED INTO THIS YELLOW BOOK 
IT MEANS THE WORLD TO SHARE THEIR GARDENS WITH THE PAYING PUBLIC 
BUT OUT OF EIGHT HUNDRED APPLICANTS EACH YEAR ONLY HALF WILL GET THROUGH 
AND WITH SUCH HIGH STANDARDS OF ENTRY 
THE ASSESSMENT IS RUTHLESS 
JUST AT THE MOMENT THERE ISN'T ANY INTEREST IS THERE 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED OH 
IT'S RATHER A MONSTROSITY 
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SAY NO 
I REALLY OUGHT TO SAY NO FOR THIS YEAR 
I'M GONNA SAY NO 
TODAY I'LL BE FOLLOWING AVID GARDENERS 
STRIVING TO TURN THEIR PRIVATE PARADISES 
INTO OPEN GARDENS 
TODAY I'LL MEET TWO COUPLES 
WHO ARE HOPING THEIR GARDENS ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE THE GRADE 
REUBEN HAS WORKED SO HARD 
OVER THE YEARS AND I THINK HE DESERVES IT 
TO BE ABLE TO GARDEN AND OPEN IT 
AND RAISE MONEY FOR THINGS THAT WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT 
JUST SEEMS A DOUBLE WHAMMY IT'S BRILLIANT 
WILL TODAY'S GARDENS HAVE WHAT IT TAKES 
TO GET ACCEPTED INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
THE FIRST GARDEN TODAY IS SPINDLE COTTAGE IN SOMERSET 
ALL THE N. G.S GARDENS ARE DIFFERENT 
BUT YOU STEP THROUGH THE GATE INTO THIS ONE 
AND YOU'RE IN A FANTASY WONDERLAND 
IT'S PACKED WITH INVENTIVE IDEAS 
INCLUDING A WHOLE COLLECTION OF TINY BUILDINGS 
THIS LOVELY ELIZABETHAN THATCHED LODGE 
A VICTORIAN POST OFFICE 
AND A CHILD SIZED GOTHIC COTTAGE 
THIS FAIRYTALE COTTAGE GARDEN 
IS THE CREATION OF ANGELA AND ALBAN BUNTING 
WHOSE LOVE FOR CHILDREN HAS LED THEM TO CREATE THIS REAL LIFE FANTASIA 
IN THE VILLAGE OF BINEGAR 
I'M VERY PROUD OF THIS GARDEN AND THE WAY IT'S ALL COME TOGETHER 
IT'S A WONDERFUL ACHIEVEMENT 
SPINDLE COTTAGE HAS BRICK PATHS AND SCATTERED FLOWER BEDS 
WITH A GAZEBO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAWN 
THE GARDEN'S MAIN ATTRACTION IS THE THREE MINI HOUSES 
THAT ALBAN'S BUILT FOR HIS GRANDCHILDREN 
THEY'RE AN ELIZABETHAN THATCHED HOUSE 
A GOTHIC COTTAGE MADE OF STONE 
AND EVEN A VICTORIAN POST OFFICE 
ONE THING THAT'S FOR CERTAIN THIS GARDEN IS ALL ABOUT CHILDREN 
I LOVE SEEING CHILDREN PLAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
THE FAVOURITE THING ABOUT THE GARDEN 
I THINK ARE THE LITTLE HOUSES ACTUALLY NOW 
IT'LL BE GREAT IF WE GET INTO THE NATIONAL GARDEN SCHEME 
TO SEE THE HOUSES AND THE GARDEN 
AND I HOPE GET INSPIRED 
FOR ANGELA IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
IF WE DON'T GET ACCEPTED INTO THE NATIONAL GARDEN SCHEME 
IT WILL BE A DISAPPOINTMENT 
BECAUSE ALBAN HAS WORKED SO HARD OVER THE YEARS 
AND I THINK HE DESERVES IT 
THE GARDEN HAS A LOVELY SETTLED FEEL HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE 
WE'VE BEEN HERE ABOUT FORTY ONE YEARS OH YES 
AND WHAT WAS HERE WHEN YOU CAME 
A DERELICT COTTAGE A DERELICT COTTAGE 
AND PRACTICALLY NO GARDEN AT ALL JUST WEEDS AND GRASS 
SO THESE WONDERFUL BUILDINGS HOW DID THEY COME ABOUT 
IT WAS WHEN WE HAD THE FIRST GRANDCHILD RUTH 
I FELT I'D BUILD HER A PLAYHOUSE THEN I THOUGHT 
NOT JUST A LITTLE WOODEN PLAYHOUSE I'LL GO OVER THE TOP A BIT 
SO WE HAD THE GOTHIC BUILDING THEN ANOTHER ONE CAME ALONG 
TOM SO I THOUGHT ELIZABETHAN THEN CHARLOTTE 
WHICH IS JUST OVER A YEAR NOW SO THE POST OFFICE 
HORTICULTURE ISN'T THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THIS GARDEN IS IT 
IT'S WANDERING AROUND AND GOING TO DIFFERENT PLACES 
AND SEEING DIFFERENT THINGS 
AND EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK THERE'S SOMETHING TOTALLY NEW 
YEAH YOU'RE CORRECT THERE YEAH I'D GO ALONG WITH THAT 
WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHETHER THAT'S WHAT THE NATIONAL GARDEN SCHEME WANT 
WOULD YOU BE TERRIBLY UPSET IF YOU DIDN'T GET IN 
IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO BE ACCEPTED 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT 
NATIONAL GARDEN SCHEME WAHEE YOU KNOW 
YEAH THAT'S A FEATHER IN YOUR CAP ISN'T IT YEAH 
ONE UPMANSHIP 
WITH THE ASSESSMENT JUST AROUND THE CORNER 
THE LACK OF ANY REAL PLANTING ISN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM 
EVEN THIS GARDEN UTOPIA HAS ITS PITFALLS 
AND THIS POND IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THEM 
COULD IT BE ENOUGH TO STOP THE COUNTY ORGANISER MAKING ANGELA AND ALBAN'S DREAMS COME TRUE 
THE PERSON ANGELA AND ALBAN HAVE TO GET ONSIDE 
FOR THEIR QUEST TO GET INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
IS THE COUNTY ORGANISER FOR SOMERSET PATRICIA DAVIES GILBERT 
WHEN I FIRST GO TO A GARDEN 
I LIKE TO SEE QUITE A LOT OF PLANTS AND COLOUR 
SO THAT I KNOW THAT THERE'S ENOUGH INTERESTING CONTENT IN THE GARDEN 
AND PATRICIA'S OWN GARDEN SHOWS HOW HIGH THE STANDARDS NEED TO BE 
THE HEALTH AND SAFETY IN PARTICULAR DOES MATTER 
CERTAINLY NOT HAZARDOUS BUILDINGS 
WE HOPE NOT TO HAVE ACCIDENTS IN GARDENS WHEN THEY'RE OPEN FOR US WE DO OUR LEVEL BEST 
OUR NEXT GARDEN IS IN GWENT 
STROLLING THROUGH THIS FRESH AND FROTHY SPRINGTIME SPACE 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE NOT IN NATURE ITSELF 
BUT IN A WOMAN MADE CREATION 
AT THE TOP OF THE GARDEN IS THIS PICTURESQUE NINETEENTH CENTURY CANAL 
AND IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT SEPARATES THIS GLORIOUS GARDEN 
FROM ITS EVEN MORE GLORIOUS BACKDROP 
AN ANCIENT WOODLAND FULL OF MAJESTIC BEECHES AND MOSS COVERED SLOPES 
THIS SUBLIMELY DESIGNED GARDEN BELONGS TO MARGARET UNDERWOOD 
WHO MOVED HERE TO THE ORCHIDS ON THE EDGE OF THE BRECON BEACONS NATIONAL PARK 
WITH HER HUSBAND ALAN FOUR YEARS AGO 
TO BE ABLE TO GARDEN ENJOY THE GARDEN 
AND OPEN IT AND RAISE MONEY FOR THINGS WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT 
JUST SEEMS A DOUBLE WHAMMY IT'S BRILLIANT 
THE GARDEN HAS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT HABITATS AND AREAS 
FROM COURTYARD TO WOODLAND INCORPORATING A NEWLY FORMED POND 
SCULPTURES AND A VARIETY OF INDIGENOUS AND EXOTIC PLANTS 
ALL BORDERED BY A NINETEENTH CENTURY CANAL 
HAVING COMPLETELY REDESIGNED THIS GARDEN IN UNDER FOUR YEARS 
MARGARET THE PRINCIPAL GARDENER 
IS QUITE RIGHTLY PROUD OF HER ACHIEVEMENT 
I THINK WE'VE GOT A PRETTY UNUSUAL GARDEN HERE 
THE SETTING IS MAGNIFICENT AND I THINK WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK 
TO TURN IT SOMETHING A BIT SPECIAL TO US 
AND I HOPE TO OTHER PEOPLE 
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE AN EXCEPTIONAL ADDITION TO THE N. G.S GARDEN SCHEME 
AND HUSBAND ALAN IS FULLY AWARE OF HOW IMPORTANT HER GARDEN IS 
I THINK MARGARET HAS A REAL PASSION AND DEVOTION TO GARDENING 
AND TO THE PLANTS IN HER GARDEN 
AND I THINK SHE LOOKS AT THE GARDEN AS SOMETHING THAT 
SHE CAN PERFECT AND WORK ON AND ALWAYS IMPROVE 
IF YOU WERE ACCEPTED HOW WOULD YOU FEEL THEN 
OH IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL I KNOW IT'S HARD WORK 
AND I KNOW I'D HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO 
I'D PROBABLY DRIVE MY HUSBAND MAD 
BECAUSE I'M SO PICKY AND I LIKE THINGS PERFECT 
BUT IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL REALLY GOOD TO SHARE IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
YOU ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT PLANTS AREN'T YOU 
I LOVE PLANTS AND SOME OF THEM ARE JUST SO GORGEOUS 
I HAVE TO HAVE THREE OR FOUR TYPES OF THE SAME PLANT 
COS THEY JUST MAKE SUCH WONDERFUL COLLECTIONS 
IT MAKES YOU GREEDY DOESN'T IT 
OH I COULD GO DOWN THE GARDEN CENTRE ANY DAY OF THE WEEK 
HOW WILL YOU FEEL IF YOU'RE NOT ACCEPTED FOR THE NATIONAL GARDEN SCHEME 
WELL I THINK THAT WOULD BE QUITE HARD 
I KNOW I'VE DONE A LOT HERE AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO THINK I'D DONE ENOUGH 
IT WOULD BE QUITE HARD I THINK IF SHE SAID NO 
WOULD YOU CRY OH PROBABLY 
WITH THE ASSESSMENT TOMORROW 
I DEARLY HOPE THAT MARGARET DOESN'T END UP IN TEARS 
BECAUSE THE GARDEN DOES HAVE ITS PROBLEM AREAS 
MARGARET'S PASSION FOR HER PLANTS AND HER GARDEN IS BEYOND DISPUTE 
BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF AREAS WITHIN THE GARDEN 
THAT LEAVE A GREAT DEAL TO BE DESIRED 
THERE'S A WOBBLY EDGE TO THE POND AND ROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
TUCKED AWAY THERE'S A VERY UNKEMPT AREA 
THE COUNTY ORGANISER FOR GWENT 
AND THE INDIVIDUAL POTENTIALLY IN THE WAY OF MARGARET'S ACCEPTANCE BY THE N. G.S IS JOANNA KERR 
IF HER GARDEN'S ANYTHING TO GO BY MARGARET COULD BE IN FOR A BUMPY RIDE 
THINGS I'M NOT SO KEEN ON WHEN I GO TO ASSESS A GARDEN IS POOR MAINTENANCE 
THE SORT OF MESSY EDGES OF PONDS IF THE LINER'S STICKING OUT 
PARTS OF THE GARDEN THAT ARE UNFINISHED REALLY NEED TO BE FINISHED OFF IN SOME WAY 
I CAN'T REALLY PASS A GARDEN IF IT HAS A LARGE UNFINISHED AREA 
THE NATIONAL GARDEN SCHEME HAVE CERTAIN STANDARDS 
IT'S THE DAY OF RECKONING FOR BOTH OUR GARDENS 
WILL THEY HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO GET TO BE ACCEPTED 
BY THE PRESTIGIOUS NATIONAL GARDEN SCHEME 
IN GWENT THE COUNTY ORGANISER'S ON HER WAY 
TO MARGARET'S FASCINATING GARDEN 
HELLO MARGARET HELLO JOANNA I'M JOANNA HOW DO YOU DO 
IT'S VERY NICE TO BE HERE 
I JUST HOPE THE POND LINING AND CANAL DON'T LET HER DOWN 
IN SOMERSET COUNTY ORGANISER PATRICIA 
HAS ARRIVED AT ALBAN AND ANGELA'S DELIGHTFUL GARDEN 
GOOD MORNING MORNING HOW NICE OF YOU TO INVITE US THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
A PLEASURE CAN WE COME AND HAVE A LOOK CERTAINLY 
BUT WILL THEY GET THEIR FAIRYTALE ENDING 
ARE YOU GOING TO ALLOW IT TO BE OPEN DEFINITELY YES EVERYTHING'S OPEN 
ON THE AFTERNOON GOSH ISN'T IT ABSOLUTELY CHARMING LOOK AT THE DETAIL 
STRAIGHT AWAY PATRICIA'S BOWLED OVER BY THE MINI COTTAGES 
IN GWENT FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE ALSO GOOD 
YES MARVELLOUS A WONDERFUL SETTING 
SPREADS OUT IN FRONT OF YOU AS YOU COME ROUND THE CORNER 
THIS SCULPTURE IS MADE FROM THE REMAINS OF THE ASH 
YES A SCULPTOR PETER WALWIN FROM THE FOREST OF DEAN YES 
TOOK HIM A DAY AND A HALF WITH A CHAINSAW 
THIS IS THE POND MY HUSBAND DUG WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH ITS SHAPE 
YES I CAN SEE MARGARET YOU'VE GOT A BIT OF THE LINER 
SHOWING ROUND THE EDGE 
WHICH SLIGHTLY SPOILS THE EFFECT A LITTLE BIT REALLY DOESN'T IT 
THAT IS A BIT OF A FAILING 
BACK AT SPINDLE COTTAGE PATRICIA HAS PICKED UP ON THE PROJECT 
THAT ALBAN'S ONLY HALF WAY THROUGH 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE WELL THIS IS OUR SEATING AREA 
FOR MY WIFE AND MYSELF AND I HOPE I CAN GET THIS UP TO SCRATCH 
A BUILDING PROJECT'S ONE THING 
BUT HAVING A CANAL AS THE BORDER FOR YOUR GARDEN'S QUITE ANOTHER 
IT'S GOT AT PRESENT IT'S COMPLETELY 
MAJOR WORKING YEAH A RISKY SPOT AS FAR AS VISITORS ARE CONCERNED 
HOW DEEP IS THE CANAL IN THE MIDDLE 
I SUSPECT IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT SIX FOOT MM HMM 
THINGS AREN'T LOOKING VERY ROSY FOR MARGARET IN GWENT 
IN SOMERSET ALBAN LEADS PATRICIA TO THE PRECARIOUS LOOKING POND 
OH GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE 
NOBODY'S GOING TO SLIP INTO IT ARE THEY 
OH GOODNESS IT IS A BIT OF A MESS THIS IS WHERE I NEED ADVICE 
SO WILL YOU KEEP A POND OF SORTS OR GET RID OF THE POND 
NO WE KEEP THE POND AND MAYBE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE TO BE LOOKED AFTER 
YES AND BE WARNED WE ONLY LET CHILDREN WHO ARE ACCOMPANIED 
YES COME INTO GARDENS 
IF THE CANAL DOESN'T PUT AN END TO MARGARET'S WISH 
TO GET INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
MAYBE THE UNKEMPT SIDE OF THE HOUSE WILL 
OH THIS IS A BIT TRICKY HERE MARGARET 
MARGARET THIS IS NOT QUITE AS 
GOOD AS THE REST OF YOUR GARDEN THIS LITTLE BIT 
THAT'S QUITE A DANGEROUS LITTLE PATCH MAYBE FOR VISITORS 
IF THEY CAME ROUND THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
TO COME DOWN THAT LITTLE SLOPE AND 
I WAS HOPING YOU WOULDN'T LOOK AT THIS BIT 
THE GARDENS HAVE BOTH BEEN APPRAISED AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE RESULTS 
YOU'VE GOT ALL SORTS OF INTERESTING THINGS 
AND THIS WONDERFUL SETTING WITH THE CANAL 
AND THE ANCIENT BEECHWOOD BEHIND IT'S ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING 
I FEAR I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO ACCEPT YOU ENOUGH WITH THE PLANTING 
NO THERE ISN'T ENOUGH IN THE GARDENS TO ACTUALLY INTEREST PEOPLE FOR VERY LONG NO 
BUT I HAVE GOT A FEW RESERVATIONS I'M AFRAID 
ABOUT DOWN THE SIDE OF YOUR HOUSE WHERE THE OIL TANK IS YES 
YOUR HOUSES ARE INCREDIBLE 
WE DO ENCOURAGE CHILDREN TO ENJOY THE ASPECT OF GARDENING 
AND ALSO THE TOP EDGE OF THE GARDEN ALONG THE CANAL 
YEAH AS FAR AS VISITORS ARE CONCERNED 
THAT'S POTENTIALLY QUITE A DANGEROUS SPOT 
AND YOU SEEM TO HAVE STARTED NEW PROJECTS THAT PERHAPS A BIT NEAR THE MARK 
YEAH KEEP YOU BUSY I'D GO ALONG WITH THAT TOO 
WILL THE MESSY SIDE OF THE GARDEN AND THE POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS CANAL 
PUT PAID TO MARGARET'S DREAMS 
SO UM I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO SAY 
NO FOR THIS YEAR OH 
IT'S SHATTERING NEWS MARGARET HASN'T BEEN ACCEPTED 
BUT SHE'S GOT FOUR MONTHS TO MAKE HER CHANGES 
BEFORE THE COUNTY ORGANISER WILL BE BACK 
TO SEE IF SHE CAN GET INTO THE YELLOW BOOK FOR NEXT YEAR 
I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED 
I WAS QUITE LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THE GARDEN OPEN THIS SUMMER 
OVER IN SOMERSET WILL IT BE A YES OR NO FOR ALBAN 
ON PLANTING I DON'T THINK WE COULD ACCEPT YOU IN THE YELLOW BOOK 
BUT YOUR HOUSES CERTAINLY WIN US OVER 
SO I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT YOU 
FOR THE FACT THAT YOU ARE GOING TO ENCOURAGE CHILDREN INTO GARDENING 
WELL THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH THEY MADE IT 
AND IN THREE AND A HALF MONTHS THIS CHILDREN'S PARADISE OF A GARDEN 
WILL BE OPENING UP TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME 
I HOPE ALBAN MANAGES TO GET EVERYTHING DONE 
YOU KNOW THAT WE'D BE IN THE NATIONAL GARDEN SCHEME 
IT'S EARLY SPRING AT THE ORCHIDS IN GWENT 
LAST MONTH MARGARET WASN'T ACCEPTED FOR THIS YEAR'S YELLOW BOOK 
ONE MAJOR PROBLEM WAS THE MESSY SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
BUT DETERMINED TO GET IN NEXT YEAR 
SHE'S ALREADY DONE LOADS FOR HER REASSESSMENT 
YOU MUST'VE FELT VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU WERE REFUSED FOR THIS YEAR 
I WAS A BIT UPSET ACTUALLY IT WAS A BIT HEARTBREAKING 
COS WE PUT A LOT OF WORK IN BUT 
YEAH BUT YOU'VE PUT A LOT OF WORK IN HERE 
WE HAVE IT REALLY IS TRANSFORMED IT'S LIKE A DIFFERENT PLACE 
WELL IT'S A MASSIVE AREA ISN'T IT 
THAT'S A VERY BIG VEG PATCH 
AND IT'S A VIRGIN VEG PATCH 
SPUDS ARE TRADITIONAL AREN'T THEY 
FOR PUTTING INTO A VIRGIN PLOT ABSOLUTELY 
THE END OF MARCH IS A GREAT TIME OF YEAR TO PLANT YOUR POTATOES 
CHOOSE A GOOD EARLY VARIETY LIKE MARIS BARD 
AND THEY SHOULD BE READY TO HARVEST AS EARLY AS JUNE 
MAKE SURE YOU PREPARE THE SOIL WITH PLENTY OF MANURE 
AND DIG YOUR TRENCH AT LEAST SIX INCHES DEEP 
AND DROP YOUR SPUDS IN WITH THEIR CHITTED ENDS FACING UP 
EIGHTEEN INCHES APART TO GIVE THEM ADEQUATE SPACE FOR YOU TO EARTH THEM UP 
AND JUST BACKFILL THE SOIL IT REALLY IS AS EASY AS THAT 
AND THE REST OF YOUR GARDEN IT'S JUST SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN 
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW ANY COUNTY ORGANISER COULD SAY NO 
I'M GONNA HOPE SO I REALLY HOPE SHE DOES SAY YES THE SECOND TIME AROUND 
IT WOULD BE SHE'D BE MAD NOT TO INDEED 
THE NEW VEG PATCH IS A GREAT ADDITION TO MARGARET'S GARDEN 
BUT ITS REAL STRENGTH LIES 
IN THE HUGE VARIETY OF INTERESTING PLANTS IT'S GOT 
MARGARET'S GARDEN IS FULL OF SPECIAL PLANTS THIS ONE'S A REAL BELTER 
IT'S EUPHORBIA MYRSINITES AND IN THE SPRING GARDEN 
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE IT FOR HANGING OVER THE EDGE OF WALLS 
COS IT'S A REALLY LAZY PLANT IT JUST SPRAWLS AROUND AND SAYS 
LOOK AT THESE BEAUTIFUL LIME GREEN BRACTS AREN'T I SPECIAL 
AT SPINDLE COTTAGE IN SOMERSET 
ALBAN AND ANGELA MAY HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED 
BUT STILL HAVE AN AWFUL LOT TO DO BEFORE THEY OPEN 
BUT LOOK AT THIS SHOP COULD DO SOME SHOPPING CAROL OH 
YEAH NEVER MIND THE GARDEN WE CAN CLIMB IN HERE ISN'T IT WONDERFUL 
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL 
LACK OF PLANTING WAS ONE CONCERN PARTICULARLY BY THEIR GRANDDAUGHTER'S POST OFFICE 
I THINK THIS SHOULD BE IN KEEPING WITH ITS VICTORIAN SETTING 
SO PLENTY OF VEGETABLES AND FLOWERS LIKE DIANTHUS 
SWEET WILLIAMS BEANS AND EVEN PEAS GROWING UP THE RAILINGS 
ALL PACKED AND GROWN IN A TUMBLE TOGETHER 
THIS BED SHOULD LOOK SPECTACULAR 
THE OTHER CONCERN WAS THE POND 
MAGNIFICENT BULRUSHES YEAH UNFORTUNATELY 
SO HAS IT GOT A PROPER LINER NO IT HASN'T GOT A LINER 
WE PUDDLED IT WITH CLAY ABOUT TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO 
IT LASTED FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS I FEEL THE BULRUSHES HAVE ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH THE CLAY 
ALTHOUGH BULRUSHES ARE A NATIVE PLANT YOU KNOW 
THEY'RE HUGELY ENERGETIC VERY VERY STRONG AND THEY'RE NOT SUITABLE 
REALLY FOR A SMALL POND LIKE THIS 
COS WHATEVER LINING YOU'VE GOT THEY'LL BREAK THROUGH 
SO WHEN YOU DIG IT OUT 
I SHOULD MAKE SURE YOU GET RID OF THEM COMPLETELY 
AND TAKE THE SEED HEADS AWAY TOO YOU DON'T WANT THEM RE SEEDING NO 
BUT YOU COULD STILL ACHIEVE SOME NICE HEIGHT 
YOU COULD HAVE PLACES FOR DRAGONFLY LARVAE TO CLIMB OUT OF THE POND 
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT IRIS PSEUDACORUS HERE THE NATIVE YELLOW FLAG 
AND PERHAPS IF YOU HAD SOMETHING LIKE BUTOMUS THE FLOWERING RUSH 
A REALLY PRETTY PRETTY LITTLE PLANT AND THAT'D GIVE YOU SOME HEIGHT 
AND THEN YOU CAN PUT LOTS OF NATIVE STUFF 
AROUND THE EDGES AND I THINK THAT SHOULD DO IT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH GREAT ADVICE 
YEAH GOOD ADVICE YOU'VE GOT TO DO THE WORK THOUGH 
WE'RE BACK AT THE ORCHIDS IN GWENT MARGARET'S BEEN WORKING HARD 
AT SORTING OUT THE AREAS THAT LET HER DOWN FOR THE ASSESSMENT 
THERE WERE JUST A COUPLE OF AREAS 
THAT WEREN'T UP TO THE YELLOW BOOK'S STANDARD 
THAT WAS WHERE THE VEGETABLE PATCH NOW IS WHICH WAS A REAL MESS 
ALAN AND I HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO PLANT UP THE VEGETABLE PATCH 
AROUND THE BACK AND WE'VE JUST EXCITINGLY 
GOT THINGS BEGINNING TO GERMINATE 
ANOTHER PROBLEM WAS THE MESSY EDGE OF A POND 
WHICH HAD THE LINER SHOWING 
MARGARET'S DONE A LOT TO BUILD THAT UP 
TO PUT MORE SOIL IN AND TO RE PLANT IT WITH PRIMROSES AND BUGLE 
TO HIDE THE EDGES OF THAT NASTY BLACK PLASTIC THAT WAS OPEN TO VIEW 
BUT THE REAL CONUNDRUM WAS THE CANAL AT THE TOP OF THE GARDEN 
I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS I CAN DO ABOUT THE CANAL AT THE TOP 
IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY 
ONE OPTION I WAS THINKING ABOUT 
IS TO CLOSE OFF THE PATHS CLOSEST TO THE CANAL EDGE 
THE OTHER THING IS WHEN THE GARDEN IS ACTUALLY OPEN 
TO HAVE SOMEBODY ANOTHER VOLUNTEER SAT UP THERE JUST TO WARN PEOPLE 
WE'RE HOPING THAT WE'VE DONE ENOUGH 
TO GET INTO THE NATIONAL GARDEN SCHEME 
ALBAN AND ANGELA AT SPINDLE COTTAGE IN SOMERSET HAVE A GARGANTUAN TASK 
TO FINISH ALL THE JOBS THEY'VE GOT 
BEFORE THEY OPEN TO THE PUBLIC IN TWO MONTHS' TIME 
FOR ALBAN THE BIGGEST JOB WAS THE POND I TOOK THE CLAY OUT 
THE FULLERS EARTH WE PUT OVER THERE 
THE NEXT PHASE WILL BE TO PUDDLE THE CLAY FOR A SHELF 
THERE'S A SHELF HERE PUT THE CARPETS IN 
PUT THE BUTANE LINER IN PUT THE FULLERS EARTH BACK 
AND THEN THIS WILL BE A BOG AREA AND THE COBBLES WILL BE HERE 
SO THE HEDGEHOG AND THINGS CAN WALK OUT 
RATHER THAN YOU KNOW STRUGGLE TO GET OFF A CLIFF 
ANGELA'S RESPONSIBILITY WAS PLANTING AROUND THE POST OFFICE 
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF WORK STILL TO DO 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE GARDEN AT ITS BEST 
AND I'M HOPING THAT'S HOW IT WILL BE 
HOPEFULLY LOTS OF PEOPLE COMING 
IT'LL BE QUITE EXCITING I HOPE IT'S A LOVELY DAY LIKE TODAY 
IT'S THE MORNING OF MARGARET'S REASSESSMENT AT THE ORCHIDS IN GWENT 
IT WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO HER TO BE ACCEPTED 
I ENJOY MY GARDEN I LOVE IT I JUST HOPE SHE'LL LOVE IT AS WELL 
JUST LOOK AT THE RESULTS THE GARDEN LOOKS RESPLENDENT 
HER NEW VEG PATCH IS A JOY AND ALL HER OTHER PLANTS LOOK STUNNING 
I'VE COME ALONG TO OFFER A BIT OF MORAL SUPPORT 
YOU'RE BUSY OH JUST THE LAST MINUTE PREPARATIONS 
BUT IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT'S WONDERFUL 
BUT YOU'RE NOT NERVOUS ARE YOU 
YES VERY EXTREMELY NERVOUS 
MY HUSBAND MADE ME LAUGH YESTERDAY COS OUR NEIGHBOUR ASKED IF I WAS READY 
AND HE SAID SHE'S GOT EVERY LEAF IRONED AND EVERY PETAL PRESSED 
WELL I'M SURE SHE'S GOING TO BE IMPRESSED WELL I HOPE SHE LIKES IT 
THIS IS THE MOMENT OF TRUTH THEN YEAH IT IS AFTER ALL THAT WORK 
I HOPE MARGARET CAN KEEP HER NERVE 
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE TRANSFORMATION MARGARET IT LOOKS FANTASTIC 
AND IT'S SO PRODUCTIVE LOOK AT THOSE WONDERFUL FAT PEAS 
I CAN SEE YOU'VE GOT SOME VERY SMART NEW STEPS INDEED 
SHALL WE GO UP THEM AND INTO THE REST OF THE GARDEN WITH PLEASURE 
AND SEE WHAT ELSE YOU'VE BEEN DOING AFTER YOU 
NOW THE POND WAS ONE OF THE LITTLE PROBLEMS WASN'T IT 
IT WAS YES AND I CAN SEE YOU'VE BEEN DOING SOME WORK ON THE EDGE 
MARGARET'S DONE AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK 
SO I HOPE SHE DOES LOOK ON THINGS FAVOURABLY 
YOU'VE CAMOUFLAGED THE POND LINER WITH THE FELT UNDERNEATH 
BUT I CAN STILL SEE THE ODD LITTLE PATCH OVER THERE 
SHE'S SPOTTED IT HASN'T SHE 
BETTER KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED 
I HOPED YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE 
I TELL YOU WHAT YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING PAST HER 
NO SHE HAS A VERY GOOD EYE 
AND THEY'RE MOVING UP INTO THE DANGER ZONE NOW MM 
HAVE YOU HAD ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW TO MANAGE THE EDGE OF THE CANAL 
AND THE WATER IF YOUR GARDEN WAS OPEN 
I THINK WE WOULD HAVE SOMEBODY UP HERE 
LOOKING AFTER VISITORS THE WHOLE TIME THE GARDEN WAS OPEN 
YES I THINK THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE NECESSARY 
O. K. 
YEAH THAT MAY BE A PROBLEM 
WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE IT SOME MORE THOUGHT MM YES 
THE REASSESSMENT IS OVER IT DIDN'T SEEM TO GO AS WELL AS IT COULD HAVE 
WILL MARGARET MAKE IT 
THANK YOU MARGARET FOR SHOWING ME YOUR GARDEN AGAIN IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH DOWN THE SIDE OF THE GARDEN WITH YOUR VEGETABLE PATCH 
ALL THOSE LOVELY STEPS YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY DONE QUITE A LOT OF WORK ON THE POND 
IT'S STILL A LITTLE JUST A FRACTION MESSY ROUND THE EDGE 
THERE'S STILL A BIT OF LINER SHOWING 
I THINK ON BALANCE YOUR GARDEN LOOKS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
SO IT WOULD BE MARVELLOUS IF YOU COULD OPEN FOR US NEXT YEAR 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH OH I'M REALLY PLEASED GOOD THANK YOU WELL ALL THAT HARD WORK'S PAID OFF 
OH IT HAS CONGRATULATIONS WELL DONE 
OH IT'S FANTASTIC ISN'T IT I'M REALLY PLEASED 
WE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT IN AND WE'VE DONE A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK 
AND I GUESS ALL THAT PRESSING AND IRONING PAID OFF 
SO MARGARET AND HER GARDEN WILL OPEN NEXT YEAR 
IN SOMERSET IT'S THE MIDDLE OF JUNE AND TODAY'S THE BIG DAY FOR ANGELA AND ALBAN 
AS IT'S THE DAY OF SPINDLE COTTAGE'S FIRST OPENING 
YOU'RE DOING WELL YOUNG MAN THANK YOU 
NOT LONG TO GO NOW BEFORE ANGELA AND ALBAN'S TOTALLY QUIRKY GARDEN 
THROWS OPEN ITS GATES FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME 
THIS IS A GARDEN NOT JUST FOR PLANTS PEOPLE BUT FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY 
AND THE WHOLE FAMILY HAVE PLAYED THEIR PART IN GETTING IT TOGETHER 
I DO HOPE THE WEATHER HOLDS THEY REALLY DESERVE IT 
AND EVERYTHING LOOKS GLORIOUS 
JUST LOOK AT ALL THE HARD WORK ANGELA AND ALBAN HAVE PUT INTO GETTING THIS GARDEN READY 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE THEY MUST HAVE WORKED LIKE TROJANS TO GET IT DONE 
IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR PEOPLE TO START POURING IN TO ENJOY THIS CHILDREN'S WONDERLAND OF A GARDEN 
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR COMING 
AND ROBIN LOVES THIS GARDEN 
I LOVE ALL THE HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY BITS 
I LIKE THE WAY THEY'VE MADE LITTLE GARDENS AROUND THE NEW HOUSES 
THE BIT IN FRONT OF THE POST OFFICE I THINK IS GORGEOUS 
THE WAY THEY MIX THE FLOWERS WITH THE VEGETABLES I REALLY LIKE THAT THAT'S MY FAVOURITE BIT 
SO WHAT DOES COUNTY ORGANISER PATRICIA THINK OF IT ALL 
ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT THE LITTLE HOUSES 
THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE THE TEA OUT THERE IT COULDN'T BE NICER 
WHAT ABOUT THE POND 
IT WAS A BIT OF A PROBLEM THAT AREA 
I'M DELIGHTED HE'S DONE SO MUCH SO WELL 
AND IT ALL LOOKS LOVELY NOW 
YEAH IF ONLY WE COULD ALL BE SO ENTERPRISING 
WELL IF ONLY WE HAD THE TALENT 
SO WHAT DID YOU THINK OF YOUR FIRST OPEN DAY 
WONDERFUL WONDERFUL INCREDIBLE 
REALLY PLEASED WITH EVERYTHING EVERYTHING WENT EXTREMELY WELL 
SO MANY PLACES FOR THE CHILDREN TO PLAY IN BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT 
THERE HAVE BEEN GROWN MEN IN ALL THESE LITTLE BUILDINGS 
JUST WISHING THEY WERE SIX YEARS OLD AGAIN YEAH 
WE'RE NEVER TOO OLD TO PLAY WE MUST ALL BEAR THAT IN MIND 
WE'RE ALL YOUNG AT HEART 
I THINK THIS IS THE MOST INSPIRING GARDEN I'VE EVER BEEN IN 
IT'S WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU ARE REALLY INSPIRING 
OH GIVE OVER 
WELL ALBAN AND ANGELA'S FIRST OPEN DAY HAS BEEN A MASSIVE SUCCESS 
THE SUN SHONE DOWN THE GARDEN'S BEEN PACKED FULL OF VISITORS 
ESPECIALLY CHILDREN WHO'VE REALLY ENJOYED THIS UNIQUE GARDEN 
THEY'VE HAD MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED VISITORS AND RAISED LOTS OF MONEY FOR CHARITY 
ALL IN ALL THINGS COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BETTER 
THE TARGETS CHANGE THE TERROR DOES NOT 
THE BLOODY HISTORY OF FORTY YEARS OF TERRORISM
