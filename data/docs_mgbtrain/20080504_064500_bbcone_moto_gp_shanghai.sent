DOWN INTO THE FIRST CORNER THIS IS 
A THREE WAY TUSSLE LOOK OUT 
JUNIOR I'M COMING THROUGH LORENZO 
ON THE INSIDE 
A LOT OF FUN L. AM 
I AM VERY HAPPY FOR THIS WIN 
TODAY 
TODAY IS THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR SETTING 
YOUR ALARM TO JOIN US IN SHANGHAI 
FOR THE FOURTH ROUND OF WHAT PROMISES 
TO BE WIDE OPEN SEASON OF MOTOGP 
ACTION AS YOU HAVE SEEN WE HAVE 
HAD THREE RACES SO FAR THREE 
DIFFERENT WINNERS FROM THREE 
DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS WE HAVE 
NOW ARRIVED AT ONE OF THE MOST 
UNPREDICTABLE CIRCUITS ON THE 
CALENDAR JUST THREE MONTHS BEFORE 
THE CITY OF BEIJING PLAYS HOST TO 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES THIS WEEKEND'S 
CHINA OPENS ITS DOORS TO AN EQUALLY 
TALENTED ARRAY OF ATHLETES AS 
MOTOGP WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP MANS FIVE HUNDRED 
MILES DOWN THE ROAD IN SHANGHAI 
THE FIRST THREE RACES HAVE LEFT THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP LOOKING LIKE THIS LORENZO IS ONLY ON TOP BY VIRTUE OF A MORE RECENT VICTORY JAMES TOSELAND HAS THE BEST 
POSITION SINCE NEIL MCKENZIE IN 
NINETEEN NINETY A GOOD START FOR JORGE LORENZO 
THREE PODIUM FINISHES AND POLL 
POSITION SO FAR THE BEST EVER 
START TO A MOTOGP SEASON FOR 
ROCKY AFTER THREE ROUNDS BUT HE 
CAME BACK TO EARTH WITH A BUMP AND 
WHAT A BOMB THESE PICTURES ARE 
FROM PRACTICE ON FRIDAY MORNING 
COMING THROUGH THAT AGAIN YOU WILL 
SEE THAT THE REAR TYRE COMES ROUND 
AND FIRES IN INTO THE AIR A TWO 
METRE ELEVATION DROP AND HE CAME 
DOWN HEAVILY ON HIS ANKLES YOU CAN 
SEE WHAT VALENTINO ROSSI 
DESPITE FRACTURING BONE IN HIS 
LEFT FOR IT AND CAUSING TISSUE 
DAMAGE TO HIS ANKLE AS WELL HE WAS 
BACK OUT ON FRIDAY MORNING YOU 
COULD SAY THAT THE EGO HAS LANDED 
BUT WHATEVER YOU THINK OF LORENZO 
HE DOES THINGS IN STYLE AND YOU 
HAVE TO GIVE HIM CREDIT YOU ALSO 
HAVE TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR COMING 
OUT ON SATURDAY MORNING WITH JUST 
AN HOUR TO SET UP THE BIKE AND THEN 
AMAZINGLY HE QUALIFIED FOR FASTEST 
LOOK OUT FOR HIM THIS AFTERNOON 
ANOTHER ROOKIE HAS BEEN MAKING A 
WAY THIS SEASON ANDREA DOVIZIOSO 
BUT HE HAS BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY 
JAMES TOSELAND HE WAS PUSHING FOR 
PODIUM BEFORE HE SLID OUT OF THE 
RACE WE CAUGHT UP WITH HIM IN 
BETTER WEATHER CONDITIONS THAN YOU 
CAN SEE BEHIND ME THIS IS ON 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
A LOT OF THE FOCUS THIS YEAR HAS 
FALLEN ON JORGE LORENZO AS THE 
ROOKIE BUT YOU ARE ALSO A ROCKY 
AND YOU HAVE HAD A GOOD START TO 
THE SEASON 
YES ESPECIALLY THE 
FIRST DAYS L. AM HAPPY THE TEAM IS 
VERY GOOD AND OUR POTENTIAL IS HIGH 
AND WE CAN FIGHT SOMETIME ALSO FOR 
THE PODIUM I THINK 
TAKE US BACK 
TO THE FIRST RACE IN QATAR AN 
INCREDIBLE BATTLE WITH VALENTINO 
ROSSI ON THE LAST LAP HE MUST BE A 
HERO FOR YOU AND EVERYBODY IN ITALY 
THE FIRST RACE I BEAT VALENTINO 
STRANGE STRANGE BUT IT WAS VERY 
NICE RACE THE FIRST LAP WAS VERY 
STRONG THE LAST THREE LAPS WITH 
VALENTINO I FELT HE WAS VERY 
CORRECT AND VERY STRONG AND VERY 
NICE 
I SPOKE TO YOUR MANAGER AFTER NICE THE RACE AND YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T 
HAVE TOLD ME THIS BUT HE SAID YOU 
WERE CRYING BECAUSE IT WAS SO 
EMOTIONAL TO RACE WITH VALENTINO 
WHEN THE RACE FINISHED I WAS VERY 
HAPPY BUT WHEN I CAME ON THE BOX 
WITH THE TEAM I SAW MANY MANY 
PEOPLE CRYING AND ALSO MADE ALSO 
ME 
THEN WE WENT ON TO JEREZ WHERE ME YOU HAD THE BATTLE WITH JAMES 
TOSELAND 
YES IT WAS A DIFFICULT TOSELAND RACE BECAUSE THE START WAS VERY BAD 
THE FIRST LAP AND THE LAST ONE BUT 
I STARTED TO OVERTAKE MANY RIDERS 
BUT OUR PLACE WAS NOT SO FAST L. AM HAPPY 
WHAT IS THE FUTURE FOR YOU HAPPY I KNOW IT IS ONLY IN THE SEASON BUT 
THE PRESS ARE ALREADY LINKING YOU 
TO THE RECORD NICKY HAYDEN HOUSE 
DO YOU SEE YOURSELF GOING THAT WAY 
IT IS TOO EARLY NOW TO SPEAK ABOUT 
THAT BUT IT SURE IS MY DREAM TO

BEST FOR ALL THE RIDERS TO RACE 
IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO EXPERIENCE 
THANK YOU GOOD LUCK HE STRUGGLED IN QUALIFYING 
YESTERDAY HE CRASHED OUT AND HIS 
WAY DOWN IN ELEVENTH SO HE WILL HAVE TO 
FIGHT THROUGH THE PACK THE MAN ON

NOW BECAUSE IT WAS WET HERE FOR THE 
ONE TO FIVE AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY RACES WHICH WE

INSIDE OF THE THIRD ROW JAMES 
PUTTING YOUR HELMET ON TO QUALIFY 
IN SEVENTH YOU MUST BE VERY HAPPY 
ESPECIALLY WITH THE CONDITIONS YES YES SIMILAR TO PORTUGAL THE TRACK IS A 
LITTLE BIT DAMP L. WAS PRETTY 
PLEASED WITH YESTERDAY L. THINK I 
WILL BE QUICK AGAIN TOMORROW IT IS 
ALWAYS JUST QUICKER AND QUICKER L. 
WAS SECOND FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AND 
IF I CAN FIND SECOND TODAY THEN I 
WILL NOT BE TOO FAR AWAY IT IS A 
LONG RACE SO WE HAVE TO HANG IN 
THERE 
NOT THE EASIEST CIRCUIT TO THERE LEARN TWO EXTREMELY LONG STRAIGHTS 
HERE SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF THREE HUNDRED TWENTY 
KILOMETRES PER HOUR BUT THERE IS 
MORE TO IT THAN THAT HERE IS STEVE 
WE ARE ON BOARD WITH JAMES TOSELAND 
BRAKING HARD TO SECOND GEAR DOWN 
TO THE TURN THAT GOES ON FOR EVER 
THEN CRANK OVER SIXTY DEGREES OVER 
ALL THE WAY ROUND AND ROUND IN A 
MINUTE WE FLICK LEFT AND THEN IT IS 
THAT IS WHERE JORGE LORENZO GOT 
FLICKED OFF THE BIKE IN PRACTICE 
THEN WE TURN THREE AND WE STAND THE 
BIKE UP ON THE POWER UP TO THIRD 
GEAR THEN ACROSS TO ANY PART OF 
THE TRACK QUITE BUMPY BRAKING 
HARD INTO TURN NO SIX VERY BUMPY 
AND THE TRACK DIPS A BIT YOU HAVE 
TO KEEP THE FRONT BRAKE TRAINING 
UP TO TURN SEVEN THAT IS TAKEN AT 
ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. WE DO NOT ALLOW THE BIKE 
TO DRIFT OUT TOO FAR TO THE RIGHT 
BECAUSE THERE IS A RIGHT COMING UP 
HERE YOU HAVE TO LIKE IT UP 
SECOND GEAR A COUPLE OF LAUGHS 
COMING UP HERE THEY ARE IT TURNS 
NINE AND TEN TAKEN AS ONE AND IT 
OCCURRED ON THE RIGHT THEN BACK IN 
TURN TEN ACCELERATING OUT OF HERE 
QUICKLY GET UP TO FOURTH GEAR THEN 
SLAM IT BACK TO FIRST GEAR 
HEARTBREAKING THERE COULD BE SOME 
OVERTAKING MANOEUVRES AT THIS POINT 
HARD BRAKING ANOTHER LONG RIGHT 
HANDER THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE ON 
THE CIRCUIT MANY HAVE TO FIND THE 
EXIT AND THERE IT IS ACCELERATE 
OUT OF HERE NOW RIGHT UP TO SIXTH 
GEAR TWO HUNDRED M. P. H. DOWN HERE JAMES WILL 
BE TUCKED UNDERNEATH THE SCREEN AT 
THIS POINT THEN HE WILL BE JAMMED 
THE BRAKES ON REALLY HARD LOSING 
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE M. P. H. JUST MUDDLE 
YOUR WAY AROUND THIS ONE THEN GRAB 
SOME POWER JUST TRYING TO KEEP THE 
FRONT END UP TURN AROUND SIXTEEN AND 
OVER THE CREST FIRE UP TO THE 
FINISHING LINE THE RECORD IS TWO HUNDRED SIX 
DANI PEDROSA THINK THAT WILL STAY STAY THAT WAS A LAP AND A DRY CONDITIONS 
IT IS DRY ON THE TRACK AT THE 
MOMENT RIDERS ON FAULTS SLIPS 
THIS WILL BE THE THING TO KEEP AN 
EYE ON BECAUSE THE FORECAST IS FOR 
RAIN WE COULD HAVE A SPLIT RACE 
HERE WHAT MUST BE GOING THROUGH 
THEIR MINDS 
YEAH THEY WILL BE 
THINKING VERY HARD ABOUT WHAT TO DO 
HERE 
YES THEY ARE EVERYBODY HAS HERE GOT CERTAIN TYRES BUT IT IS A WET 
RACE THAT MEANS THAT IF IT DOES 
CHUCK IT DOWN THEY WILL JUST COME 
IN AND CHANGE BIKES IT WILL BE 
VERY TRICKY AND THE TEMPERATURES 
ARE MUCH LOWER THAN THEY WERE 
DURING ALL THE QUALIFYING THERE 
WILL BE SOME DESTINATIONS AT THIS 
POINT AS FAR AS TYRES ARE CONCERNED 
AND COMPOUNDS 
NOT A GREAT JOB FROM 
NICKY HAYDEN INTENSE SPOT HE IS 
VERY DISAPPOINTED NAKANO ALONGSIDE 
JOHN HOPKINS THAT WAS ANOTHER 
HEAD SCRATCHING BECAUSE HOPPER 
LOOKED VERY GOOD AROUND HERE BUT 
THE KAWASAKI WAS DISAPPOINTING SIX SIX RIDERS CRASHED DURING THE 
QUALIFYING SESSIONS AND THOSE GUYS 
HAVE PAID THE PENALTY NICKY HAYDEN 
AS WELL ALBEIT THEY ALL GOT BACK 
AND GOT THEIR SPARE BIKES BUT THAT 
REALLY DISRUPTS THE SESSION 
VALENTINO ROSSI IS STARTING FROM 
THE FRONT ROW OF THE GRID FOR THE 
FIRST TIME THIS YEAR VERY 
INTERESTING LORENZO THIS IS 
DON'T BELIEVE IT HE HAS STALLED 
THE BIKE WAS ABOUT TO SAY HE 
WOULD HAVE TO START FROM THE BACK 
THAT WAS THE LAST THING HE NEEDED 
TO DO THEY WILL STOP HIM THEY 
HAVE GOT IT GOING L. WAS ABOUT TO 
SAY THAT IN MY DAY YOU WOULD HAVE 
HAD A POOR START PUSH THE REVOLUTIONS DROPPED A LITTLE 
BIT TOO MUCH THEY DO NEED SOME TO 
GET THEM OFF THE LINE 
BUT REAL 
SHAME THE FIRST TIME HE HAS NOT 
STARTED ON POLE POSITION HE WILL 
NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO START 
FROM ANYWHERE APART FROM THE FRONT 
BUT A TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT FOR 
HIM THEY CANNOT PUT ANY WEIGHT ON 
HIS ANKLES BUT ALL THESE GUYS WET 
OR DRY IT IS LIKE BEING A JOCKEY 
YOU ARE NOT SITTING ON THE SEAT FOR 
A SECOND YOU KEEP YOUR WEIGHT OFF 
THE SEAT TO SLIDE YOUR BODY AROUND 
AND BREAK INTO THE CORNERS AND YOU 
SHIFT YOUR WEIGHT INSIDE OR OUTSIDE 
DEPENDING WHERE YOU WANTED ALL THE 
TIME THE MEN ARE WORKING SO HARD 
AND LORENZO WILL BE IN AGONY THEY 
WILL HAVE GIVEN HIM SOME 
PAINKILLERS TO SETTLE THINGS DOWN 
BUT THAT WILL HAVE DISTURBED TEN 
HAVING TO PUSH THAT BIKE 
DISTURBED HIM 
HE HAS NEVER STARTED 
ANYWHERE BUT POLE POSITION SO FAR THIS IS IT TWO HUNDRED TEN MILES PER HOUR 
VIRTUALLY THE FASTEST WE HAVE SEEN 
ALL WEEKEND WAS CASEY STONER DOING 
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY KILOMETRES POWER IN THE WET 
THIS MORNING THE COLD AIR MADE 
THAT THE DUCATI AT ENGINE WORK 
REALLY WELL THAT DUCATI ENGINE 
THAT FINAL KERNER IS CORNER IS 
LITTLE BIT LIKE THE ONE AT 
DONINGTON YOU GO OVER THE CREST 
AND THEN THE FIRE IT DOWN THE 
STRAIGHT HOW GOOD IS DONINGTON 
PARK GOING TO BE THIS YEAR IT OUT 
STANDING 
THAT IS GOING TO BE THE STANDING THING TO WATCH THE FIRST POLE 
POSITION FOR TECH THREE SINCE THE FIVE HUNDRED 
DAYS 
HE NEEDS TO CONVERTED NOW DAYS IT CONVERTS IT GETTING READY TO START IN CHINA 
RED LIGHTS ARE ON EVERYONE AWAY 
CLEANLY A GOOD START FROM EDWARDS 
ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE 
SCREEN LOOK AT THAT RED FLASH 
STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE HE NICKY 
HAYDEN GOT RUN OFF THE TRACK HERE 
LAST YEAR BUT THEY LOOKED TO BE 
GETTING OFF NICELY 
NICE MANOEUVRE 
KEPT AT THE BIKE DOWN NICE AND LOW 
AT VERY CHEEKY MOVE BY CASEY STONER 
AND AN EVEN FIRMER WON THE BY 
EDWARDS EVERYONE JUST FEELING THEIR WAY 
AROUND MOST OF THESE GUYS WILL 
HAVE GONE TO A SOFTER COMPOUND TYRE 
BECAUSE THE TEMPERATURES HAVE 
DROPPED IMMENSELY IT WAS A TRACK 
TEMPERATURE OF FIFTY ONE DEGREES IN 
QUALIFYING BUT IT IS NOW MUCH 
COOLER LOOKS TO ME LIKE A LOT OF 
THEM HAVE GOT THE SHROUDS ARM BIG 
CARBON BRAKES TO KEEP THE 
TEMPERATURE IN THEM NICKY HAYDEN HAVING A REALLY GOOD 
SCRAP WITH LORENZO A LONG CORNER 
THAT IS THE BIG ONE THIS IS THE 
MOST IMPORTANT CORNER ON THE 
CIRCUIT THIS IS WHERE THEY FIRE IT 
UP DOWN THIS LONG STRAIGHT STORMING AWAY FROM VALENTINO ROSSI 
PEDROSA HAVING LOOK AROUND THE 
OUTSIDE AND A ROSSI CAN'T DO IT 
PEDRO IS THAT ALMOST MADE IT 
PEDROSA 
THERE WAS A POINT WHERE PEDROSA DANI PEDROSA COULDN'T QUITE STOP IT 
HE WAS RUNNING A BIT DEEPER INTO 
THE CORNER BUT IT DIDN'T TO HAVE A 
LOT OF HARM HE HAS PASSED ROSSI 
CASEY STONER TOOK EDWARDS ARE ONLY 
FOR A MOMENT PEDROSA JUST GETS THE 
DOOR SHUT IT TO STOP VALENTINO 
ROSSI MOVING THROUGH 
THAT WAS 
CLOSE DANI PEDROSA A VERY CHEEKY 
MOVE ROSSI IS TRUE AS WELL WHERE HAS A 
STONER GONE ARE THROUGH 
I TOLD 
YOU PEDROSA THAT WOULD BE ONE TO 
WATCH HE IS REALLY GETTING HIS 
HEAD DOWN 
I CAN SEE HIM 
DISAPPEARING HE HAS BEEN ON GREAT 
FORM THIS WEEKEND THE BIKE IS FAST 
ARE NOT GOT THE PNEUMATIC ENGINES 
YET BUT THEY ARE GETTING THIS 
MACHINE FASTER AND FASTER EVERY 
WEEK 
AND HE IS SO LITTLE HE WEEK DOESN'T LOSE IT DOWN THE BACK 
STRAIGHT 
YOU LOOK AT THE FRONT END STRAIGHT YOU CAN HARDLY SEE ANYONE ON THE 
BIKE 
EDWARDS IS IN FRONT OF ROSSI BIKE ROSSI WILL WANT TO STICK WITH 
PEDROSA THAT IF HE CAN HERE IS 
THAT PASS 
THAT IS GOOD FOR DANI 
PEDROSA HE MANAGED TO TO GET THAT 
ON THE STOCK NEVER DRIVE A HAS THE 
RUN ON EDWARDS NOW PEDROSA THIS IS THE LONGER DRAG IT DOWN ALONG TRACK FANTASTIC BREAKS I THEN CASEY STONER WAS LOOKING AT 
A VALENTINO ROSSI BREAKING THEM 
L. THINK ROSSI HAS GOT TO DO RUN L. 
THINK HE WILL GOT DO I THINK 
YOU'LL GO DOWN THE INSIDE COLIN EDWARDS IS A GREAT SCRAPPER 
HE NEEDS TO CONVERT THIS INTO 
RESULTS DOES NOT NEED TO DRIFT 
BACK AS YOU SAID 
I DON'T THINK 
YOU'LL BE THERE TOO DISAPPOINTED 
HERE IS THE MOVE BACK WILL BE THE 
AIR WAS NEVER GOING TO STOP IT 
BACK WHEEL IN THE AIR 
CASEY STONER 
NOTE TO SELF IGNORE ROSSI'S 
RAKING LIGHT EDWARDS STILL THERE IN THIRD CASEY 
STONER HAS BEEN SHUFFLED BACK TO 
FOURTH QUITE SMARTLY BY VALENTINO 
ROSSI LORENZO IS ADDING A GREAT 
OLD A SCRAP WITH THE SUZUKI OF 
CAPIROSSI ONE PERSON WE HAVE NOT SAYING MUCH 
OF THIS IS AN IS MARCO MELANDRI 
BUT HE IS IN A NIGHT POSITION 
THIS SEASON HE IS IN NINTH LOOK AT THE SPARKS COMING OFF THE 
BIKE OF MELANDRI 
DOWN STRAIGHT 
WE GO AND LOOK AT THIS ACTION 
GLENN TEAM OF SQUIRTS IN THAT 
SUZUKI COULD BE TO DRAFTING THERE 
PLENTY OF SQUIRT LORENZO 
FIGHTING BACK A LEFT HAND TURN 
COMING UP 
GREAT WORK ON THE BRAKES 
THERE BY DOVIZIOSO 
AND JAMES IS 
RIGHT IN BEHIND A BAT PACK 
FANTASTIC TO SEE MELANDRI IN THE 
HUNT THERE IS A VISIT TO TAME HIM ON THE 
SIDE OF HIS BOOT A PIECE OF TITANIUM HEARN AND A VALENTINO ROSSI LOOKS 
ON THE INSIDE OF LORENZO A 
VALENTINO ROSSI 
LORENZO IS 
CARRYING THAT INJURY HE WILL BE IN 
A BIT OF PAIN NOW WHEN HE TRIED TO 
QUALIFY THEY WERE VERY SHORT 
STINTS 
IT THOUGHT HE WOULD BE STINTS STRUGGLING A BIT WITH HIS ARM 
OPERATION BUT THAT IS THE LEAST OF 
HIS WORRIES HE THOUGHT HIS 
ANKLES ARE SO HURTING SO BADLY 
WE SAW THE INCIDENT AT THE START OF 
THE SHOW BEING FLUNG OFF THE TOP 
OF A BUS A VERY LUCKY NOT TO DO 
ANY MORE INJURIES THAN HE HAS DONE 
ALREADY VERY LUCKY 
YOU KNOW ALL 
ABOUT RIDING THROUGH THE PAIN 
BARRIER REMEMBER THAT TIME YOU 
FLEW ECONOMY TOSELAND IS IN TOUCH I THINK HE IS ABOUT TO BE PASSED AT GAP LEFT OPEN A FALL DOVIZIOSO OPEN FOR THEY ARE STUCK TO IT A PRETTY 
TIGHTLY BUNCHED 
VALENTINO ROSSI 
HAS NOT LET DANI PEDROSA GO AS THEY 
CAME OVER THE LINE VALENTINO ROSSI 
IS TAKING THE FIGHT TO DANI PEDROSA THERE IS THE BATTLE WITH JAMES TOSELAND NAKANO RIGHT BEHIND HIM THEY HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN REDUCING 
THAT GAP THEY BOTH PUT IN THE 
FASTEST LAPS LAST TIME STILL OUTSIDE THE LAP RECORD IT 
GOES BACK TO DANI PEDROSA IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
WHEN THEY WERE RIDING THE BIGGER 
MACHINES IT REALLY DID MAKE A BIG 
DIFFERENCE ON THIS CIRCUIT THEY 
WERE DOING FIFTEEN KILOMETRES POWER MORE 
DOWN THE STRAIGHT KPH YOU WOULD BET YOUR MONEY ON 
VALENTINO ROSSI PASSING AT THE END 
OF THE STREET STRAIGHT HONDA HONDA VERSES YAMAHA DANI PEDROSA 
PUNCHING A HOLE IN THE AIR THERE THERE IS THAT THE SNAKE SHOT MOVE THERE 
IS NO AIR IN FRONT OF HIM AS LONG 
AS ROSSI DOES NOT OUTBREAK HIMSELF 
HE HAS THAT NICELY SORTED OUT 
ROSSI GREAT ON THE BRAKES PEDROSA PEDROSA TRYING TO FIGHT BACK THERE IS TO PASS AGAIN NICE AND 
EASY ROSSI STAYED ON TIGHT 
INSIDE LINE THERE THE TEAM WILL 
VERY HAPPY ROSSI WITH SEVENTEEN LAPS 
REMAINING LEADS THE SHANGHAI GRAND 
PRIX ROUND FOUR 
THAT WAS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE KPH 
HE DID DOWN THE BACK STRAIGHT THAT 
IS ABSOLUTELY HONKING HERE IS THE BIG CHALLENGE CAN HE 
OPEN UP THE GAP 
IT IS ALL ABOUT 
TYRE CONSERVATION L. SUSPECT THAT 
ONE OR TWO OF THE RIDERS WENT FOR A 
SLIGHTLY SOFTER TYRE L. CAN SAY 
THAT CASEY STONER WENT FOR THE 
MEDIUM TYRE DANTE ROSSO BANTING 
THE ROSSI ALSO WENT FOR THE MEDIUM 
REAR TYRE VALENTINO ROSSI LAST LAST LAP AROUND THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD 
SPEED FROM ROSSOUW THREE HUNDRED FORTY THREE KPH FROM 
VALENTINO ROSSI THAT IS THE FAST 
AS WE HAVE EVER SEEN THESE EIGHT HUNDRED 
BIKES GO THAT IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN M. P. H. 
UNBELIEVABLE STUFF JOHN HOPKINS IS RIGHT AT THE BACK 
OF THE PACK 
HE HAS EITHER GOT A 
PROBLEM OR HE HAS GONE ON AN 
EXCURSION 
ROSSI SHAKES HIS HEAD EXCURSION ARE THERE HE HAS SORTED IT HE IS BEHIND MELANDRI NOW SO THAT 
ALL BUT EDWARDS BACK IN TO EIGHTH 
POSITION THE VERY FRUSTRATING FOR 
COLIN YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT HIM 
NEEDING TO CONVERT INTO RESULTS IT IT IS NOT GOING D. A. HAPPEN TO HIM THIS 
WEEK IT LOOKS LIKE ALL THAT HARD 
WORK IN QUALIFYING AND THERE HE IS 
IN SEVENTH POSITION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T 
GET TO DO IN CAR RACING IS THAT YOU 
DON'T GET TO PRACTISE WHAT IT IS 
LIKE BREAKING FROM THE SLIPSTREAM 
ESPECIALLY ON A STRAIGHT BAT ALONG 
BUT THAT LONG CHRIS VERMEULEN HAS GONE INTO THE PIT 
ANOTHER TIME OUT TO ME LOOKS PIT LIKE IT IS GOING YEAR 
U. S. A. THAT 
THEY ARE TRYING SOFTER TYRES SO 
THEY ARE GOING TO HIT HER LIKE MAD 
GOING DOWN THE STRAIGHT YOU WERE 
SAYING THEY ARE DROPPING LIKE FLIES THE 
SUZUKI IS THE SPEED THAT WE ARE 
SEEING MOST OF THE TIME IT WAS 
ANNIKE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY IN QUALIFYING NOW IT IS 
ONLY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THERE IS A TAIL WIND AS WELL SO 
EVERYTHING IS GOING CRAZY ON THE 
TOP SPEED NOT FOLLOWING THEM YAMAHA DOWN THE 
STRAIGHT INTERESTING FOR THE 
YAMAHA NOT KNOWING HOW FAST THEY 
ARE GOING 
LOOK AT BACK WINDSOCK 
IT IS RIGID IT MUST BE TWENTY KNOTS 
YES JAMES WAS TELLING ME THAT HE USES 
THE HOARDING THAT STICKS OUT OVER 
THE MAIN STRAIGHT ANDREA DOVIZIOSO FIGHTING STRAIGHT 
BACK SPARKS FLY EVERYWHERE HE IS 
NOW PUSHING BACK A FANTASTIC SCRAP 
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM MELANDRI 
HAS BEEN TAKING RACING PILLS 
FANTASTIC TO SEE CHRIS VERMEULEN'S BIKE BEING 
RETIRED A REAL SHAME FOR THOSE 
GUYS AND REALLY BAD FOR CHRIS 
VERMEULEN HE HAS HAD AN APPALLING 
SEASON SO FAR THINGS HAVE JUST NOT 
HAPPENED FOR HIM HE IS SITTING 
DOWN IN TWELFTH PLACE MARCO MELANDRI THIS IS GREAT TO SEE 
DOVIZIOSO SAID BEFORE A RACE SEE THAT HE THOUGHT HE HAD SOME GOOD 
PACE BUT THAT HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE PACK AND WOULD NEED A GOOD 
SCRAP WE WERE NOT EXPECTING MARCO 
MELANDRI TO BE THE GUY TO DISH IT 
OUT 
WE DID NOT 
NICKY HAYDEN IN OUT FOURTH AND MELANDRI IN FIFTH GET YOUR 
HEAD AROUND THAT 
THE WAY THINGS 
ARE GOING HE WILL CATCH UP WITH 
CASEY STONER SOON THAT WILL BE A 
SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM L. L. THINK DANI 
PEDROSA HAS SOMETHING UP HIS SLEEVE 
HE PULLED LEFT LIKE LAST TIME 
BIDING HIS TIME WITH FIFTEEN LAPS TO GO 
TRYING TO KEEP THE TYRES IN GOOD 
SHAPE THIS IS A REAL SCRAP NICKY HAYDEN 
MELANDRI THROUGH PASSING THE 
FORMER WORLD CHAMPION THAT WILL 
LIFT HIS TAIL INTO THE LEFT HANDER 
AND MELANDRI IS GOING TO MOVE UP 
THIS IS FANTASTIC MELANDRI UP TO 
FOURTH PLACE BEHIND HIS TEAM MATE 
AMAZING ISN'T IT L. DO NOT THINK 
THEY HAVE CHANGED THE BIKE THAT 
MUCH THEY WERE TRYING TO CHANGE 
THE WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION L. THINK 
THAT MARCO MELANDRI'S MIND HAS COME 
BACK INTO GEAR A CONFIDENCE THING 
LOST IT CASEY STONER WAS SAYING BEFORE THAT 
HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SO CONFIDENT 
ABOUT THE FRONT BUT THIS YEAR NOT 
SO MUCH MAYBE WHAT HE HAS GOT IS 
FILTERING THROUGH 
I HAVE A 
SUSPICIOUS FEELING THAT THE BAD 
FEELING THAT CASEY HAS HAD TO A 
CERTAIN EXTENT HAS BEEN BECAUSE YOU 
START TO FEEL LESS CONFIDENT AT THE 
FRONT THERE IS NOTHING LIKE LOOKING AT 
SOMEONE'S EXHAUST PIPE TO GIVE YOU 
A BAD FEELING I WAS HOPING TO HEAR FROM OUR PIT 
LANE MAN BUT WE WILL BE SEEN WE 
WILL DO SOONER HOPKINS HAS PICKED UP THE PACE 
JUST AN EXCURSION FROM HIS POINT OF 
VIEW THESE TWO HAVE JUST BOLTED 
THE MASSIVE GAP CASEY STONER HAS 
NOTHING LEFT AND IF HE IS NOT 
CAREFUL YOU WILL GET INTO TROUBLE 
HE WILL 
THE WHOLE GAME HAS MOVED 
ON MELANDRI FANTASTIC FIGHT 
BETWEEN HIM AND DOVIZIOSO BIKE 
NUMBER FOUR ROSSI AND PEDROSA THROUGH A LONELY 
WORLD CHAMPION NOW TWO SECONDS IN 
FRONT OF MARCO MELANDRI JAMES 
TOSELAND HAS NOT MISSED OUT ON THAT 
SCRAP SO FAR FRUSTRATED BY ELEVENTH 
HE HAS JUST HAD A SLOW LAP WHETHER 
THAT IS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE 
TYRE SITUATION WE WILL HAVE TO 
SEE IF HE CAN PICK UP THE PACE 
AGAIN 
CAN WE HEAR FROM THE PIT AGAIN LANE NOW WHAT ABOUT CHRIS YES YES CHRIS VERMEULEN CAME IN WITH A 
CLUTCH PROBLEM THE MECHANICS 
THOUGHT THEY COULD FIX IT SO HE 
JUMPED BACK ON THE BIKE BUT THE 
BIKE STALLED AND THE CLUTCH IS 
WRECKED AS YOU HAVE PROBABLY 
NOTICED BY NOW HE HAS GONE FOR AN 
EARLY SHOWER LORIS CAPIROSSI HAVING A PRETTY 
GOOD RUN I CHATTED TO HIM 
YESTERDAY AND HE WAS SAYING THAT 
THEY THINK THEY HAVE FINALLY GOT A 
BRIDGESTONE TYRE BUT WITH THE 
SUZUKI HE HAD BEEN FRUSTRATED BY 
THAT BRIDGESTONE REALLY HAVE BEEN MAJORING WITH CASEY STONER VALENTINO ROSSI ALSO TENDS TO BE FAIRLY DEMANDING JORGE LORENZO MUST BE IN AGONY AT 
THIS POINT BUT ALL CREDIT TO HIM 
HE IS STILL CIRCULATING AND HE WILL 
STILL PICK UP A BAG FULL OF POINTS 
IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE INDEED HE PAID A PRICE FOR THAT MISTAKE 
BUT HE HAS COME BACK HARD IN FRONT 
OF NICKY HAYDEN ALREADY LAP TIMES COMING IN NOW PEDROSA WAS FASTEST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN NOW WE ARE ON BOARD WITH DANI 
PEDROSA HOLDING A TIGHTER LINE 
VALENTINO ROSSI USING A DEFENCES 
LINE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN 
AS YOU 
WOULD IT DOES LOOK TO BE THAT DANI 
PEDROSA FEELS PRETTY COMFORTABLE AT 
THE PACE THEY ARE GOING AT NOW NO 
PRESSURE FROM BEHIND 
SEVEN SECONDS 
THE GAP BETWEEN DANI PEDROSA AND 
CASEY STONER THE BOY THAT DUCATI 
HAVE MADE SOME IMPROVEMENTS AS I 
WAS SAYING THAT THEY WILL BE 
SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS THE BOY 
IS AT THE COUNTY 
WHEN THEY ARE NOT 
IN HIS SLIPSTREAM SITUATION CASEY STONER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT TEN KILOMETRES AN 
HOUR NOT TO BE SNEEZED AT BUT THE 
CIRCUIT IS NOT ALL ABOUT THAT PEDROSA IS ON MICHELIN TYRES DANI 
BUT ROSE IS BIDING HIS TIME IN MY 
OPINION AT THE MOMENT DANI 
PEDROSA THE THIRD GEAR THEN UP TO SIX BUT WHEN HAS TO START A DRESS 
REHEARSAL THE START AND FINISH 
LINE IS JUST AROUND THAT LEFT 
HANDER WHEN WILL HE STARTED 
DRESS REHEARSAL WE MAY FIND BECAUSE OF THE 
SITUATION WE ARE IN THAT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE TAKING GUESS ON TYRES 
THESE ARE CONDITIONS WE HAVE NOT 
SEEN ALL WEEKEND PRIVATE COOL 
DRIVE BUT COOL EVERYONE IS TRYING TO CONVINCE THE 
RIDERS OF THE BEST TYRE TO USE 
NICKY HAYDEN MUST HAVE TYRE ISSUES 
AS WELL HE HAS BEEN STORMING TO 
THE BACK OF THE GRADE IN THE PAST 
FEW LAPS AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
GETTING PAST THAT PUTS HIM WAY 
BACK IN EIGHTH SPOT 
A FRUSTRATING 
SEASON FOR NICKY HAYDEN 
HE STARTED 
VERY WELL HE WAS UP THERE IN FOURTH 
AS WE SAW SO HE IS LOSING SPOT 
AFTER SPOT 
THEY DID NOT REALLY GET 
A COMPLETE RACE SORTED OUT A LOT 
OF PEOPLE WANT THE WARM UP IN THE 
MORNING TO FINALISE THEIR SETTING 
BUT IT THREW IT DOWN WITH RAIN SO 
THAT WENT 
OUT THE WINDOW VALENTINO ROSSI STARTING TO EASE OUT AN ADVANTAGE ON THAT RIGHT 
HANDER IT SEE FAR ENOUGH AWAY TO 
KEEP PEDROSA OUT OF HIS SLIPSTREAM 
IS HE FAR ENOUGH AWAY DANI DANI PEDROSA KNOWS IT BETTER THAN ME 
BUT THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS 
VALENTINO ROSSI BEHIND YOU ON THE 
FINAL LAP 
THERE WILL BE SOME 
INTERESTING THINKING OVER THE NEXT 
FEW VALENTINO ROSSI WILL TRY TO 
MAKE A JUDGEMENT AS TO WHETHER 
PEDROSA IS CLOSE ENOUGH 
IT WILL BE 
ALL ABOUT WHO CAN RIDE THOSE 
CORNERS ONE UP TO THIRTEEN IS WHAT IT IS 
ALL ABOUT THOSE PIT BOARDS COMING 
OUT WITH ALL 
THE INFORMATION CASEY STONER EIGHTY SIX SECONDS BACK FASTEST LAP TO ROSSI MARCO MELANDRI TRYING TO WASH OFF THE SPEED AT THE END OF THE PIT 
STRAIGHT COMING DOWN TO SOME REAL 
PRESSURE TONI ELIAS HAVING A MUCH HAPPIER 
WEEKEND AS WELL ALL THE DUCATI 
BOYS ARE IN FRONT OF WHERE THEY 
MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED TO BE HE HAS SUFFERED FROM BEING LAST A 
FEW TIMES 
TONI ELIAS SEEMS TO HAVE 
FOUND THE COMBINATION THAT YOU NEED 
TO RIDE THE DUCATI IN THE PAST IT 
HAS ONLY BEEN CASEY STONER THIS 
YEAR BUT MARCO MELANDRI HAS FOUND 
THE COMBINATION THERE HE IS IN FOURTH 
POSITION ALBEIT THIRTEEN SECONDS BACK 
FROM THE LEADER BUT HE IS THERE 
AND ON THE PACE DANI PEDROSA HAS A 
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STYLE AS FAR 
AS I AM CONCERNED MORE AGGRESSIVE 
AND USING THAT MINIMALIST WEIGHT 
THAT HE HAS GOT HE THROWS HIMSELF 
AROUND THE BIKE YOU WATCH IN 
SHIFTING EVERY RIDER IT USES A 
PIECE OF BALLAST AND USES THAT 
WEIGHT TO ITS BEST CHECKING HIMSELF ABOUT ON THE TERMS 
AND MORE THAN THAT WEATHER IS 
NORMALLY GREAT NEWS FOR SOMEBODY 
LIKE VALENTINO ROSSI BECAUSE HE CAN 
WALK ON WATER SO WET WEATHER IS 
GOOD FOR HIM BUT PEDROSA HE DID IT 
BUT EVEN IN THE WARM UP HE WAS 
RIGHT IN THE MONEY IN THE RAIN 
MELANDRI HAS HAD SOME FAST PILLS 
BUT PEDROSA HAS SOME RIDING IN WET 
WEATHER PILLS YOU HAVE GOT TO 
LEARN TO RIDE IN THE RAIN AND IT 
WILL INVARIABLY RAIN COMING INTO A BIT OF A TYRE BATTLE 
NOW WHO HAS THE GRIP 
AND WHO MADE 
THE RIGHT CHOICE PEDROSA WENT FOR A HARD FRONT TYRE 
AND THE MEDIAN REAR TYRE 
A GREAT 
SCRAP NOW COLIN WOULD BE HAVING A GREAT RACE 
IF HE HAD NOT OVERCOOKED IT EARLIER 
BECAUSE HE IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY 
THIS IS THE BATTLE FOR SIXTH PLACE 
NOW GIVEN THAT HE HAD TO REJOIN 
THE RACE HE IS DOING VERY WELL 
LORENZO CANNOT CREDIT HIM ENOUGH 
WITH THE INJURY HE HAS GOT HE WILL 
BE UNCOMFORTABLE ON THE BIKE BUT 
STILL LOOKING COMFORTABLE I RECKON THESE GUYS THINK THEY ARE 
FOLLOWING CASEY STONER THEY WILL 
NOT BELIEVE IT IS MARCO MELANDRI 
HE HAS FINISHED ELEVENTH TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH 
THIS SEASON 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
HERE REALLY GOOD TO 
SEE HIM BAFFLING TO SEE A FORMER RACE WINNER LIKE MELANDRI LITERALLY QUALIFYING LAST 
IN SOME SESSIONS 
FIVE WINS TO HIS 
NAME SECOND IN THE MOTOGP 
CHAMPIONSHIP BEFORE HE WILL SURGE AHEAD NOW YOU WOULD IMAGINE I WOULD SAY THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 
PEOPLE LINING UP FOR THAT JOB AFTER 
THIS WEEKEND 
FUNNY WHEN PEOPLE 
LINE UP FOR YOUR JOB THIS WILL END 
UP IN TEARS IF WE ARE NOT CAREFUL 
COLIN EDWARDS NEARLY CAPITALISED ON 
THAT ANDREA DOVIZIOSO IS IN THE THICK OF 
IT ALL EVERY TIME WE TURN UP IT IS 
HIM 
THEY HAVE GOT INTO THE HIM SLIPSTREAM OF MARCO MELANDRI AND 
YOU SEE HIM HAVING TO PICK IT UP A 
BIT DOVIZIOSO HAD NO CHOICE 
BECAUSE HE WAS ON THE OUTSIDE LINE JORGE LORENZO WAS LATE ON THE 
BRAKES AND YOU CAN SEE THE BIKES 
SCRAPING THEY CANNOT SHIFT HIS 
WEIGHT AROUND AS HE WOULD LIKE 
BECAUSE YOU CANNOT PUT ANY WEIGHT 
ON HIS FEET THIS 
IS A TERRIFIC SCRAP OF THIS IS ALL THE BATTLE FOR FOURTH PLACE IT IS MELANDRI LEADING JAMES TOSELAND IS IN TWELFTH PLACE 
BUT LAPPING A BIT SLOWER THAN 
EVERYONE ELSE AROUND HIM WHATEVER 
HE HAS CHOSEN AS FAR AS THE TYRE IS 
CONCERNED IT HAS NOT REALLY WORKED 
FOR HIM HE WENT FOR THE MEDIUM 
REAR AND BARNHART FRONT AT THE 
SAME AS MOST OF THE MICHELIN 
RUNNERS HARD FRONT 
DOVIZIOSO IS 
STILL IN THE HUNT HERE 
THIS IS THE 
PASS IT DOWN THE INSIDE A NICE 
MOVE ME OUT AS HE DROPS THE YAMAHA 
IN ME BACK ACROSS THE STRAIT WE GO ARE 
ONLY SEVEN LAPS LEFT OF THIS CASEY 
STONER IS STILL BATTLING ALONG IT IS ALL GOING PEAR SHAPED FOR 
MARCO MELANDRI 
BUT HE WHINGES AT 
THE DOOR SHUT AGAIN DOVIZIOSO IS A VERY ADEPT A RACER ADEPT RACER MOST OF THESE GUYS HAVE GOT 
DIFFERENT TRACK SETTINGS THEY WILL 
BE FLICKING THEM ARE OVER NOW L. 
THOUGHT DOVIZIOSO WAS THAN STAB 
UP THE INSIDE THERE YOU CAN START 
TO SEE THE BIKES SLIDING AROUND A 
BIT MORE THERE THE HONDA TEAM HAVE A BIT OF AN 
AERO PACKETS THIS WEEKEND 
PACKAGE I AM WANDERING ABOUT JAMES TOSELAND 
HE HAS GONE UP TO THE MORE NARROWED 
MICHELIN TYRE AS DID COLIN EDWARDS 
DOVIZIOSO AS WE KNOW WHO IS IN FOURTH 
SPOT HAS ALWAYS RUN THE NARROWED 
MICHELIN TYRE THAT SEEMS TO GO 
FASTER BUT COLIN AND JAMES 
TOSELAND IN THE TECH THREE TEAM HAVE 
USED THE WIDER TYRE BUT THEY HAVE 
GONE FOR THE MORE NARROW ONE L. 
WONDER IF THEY ARE SUFFERING 
LITTLE BIT BY A LACK OF INDIA RENTS 
ADHERENTS STILL LOOKS TO ME LIKE PEDROSA HAS 
THE ADVANTAGE HE HAS BEEN VERY 
COMFORTABLE SITTING IN SECOND PLACE 
WHENEVER HE HAS LOST THE LEAD BY 
ROSSI PULLING AWAY HE HAS CLOSED 
THE GAP DOWN VERY QUICKLY AGAIN 
MELANDRI HAVING A LOOK BACK IT IS 
LORENZO IN FRONT LORENZO HAS THAT 
IN CONTROL THERE IS TONY ALLY S. 
HE IS IN TENTH PLACE HAVING A VERY 
GOOD WEEKEND TONI ELIAS POOR OLD JOHN HOPKINS I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT WENT ON WITH HIM AN EXCURSION 
OF THE TRACK SOMEWHERE BUT HE IS 
NOT ABLE TO PULL ANY PLACES BACK 
HE IS LAPPING IT CONSISTENTLY BUT 
HE WILL NOT GET VERY FAR 
HE IS OUT 
OF THE POINT TO SIXTEENTH PLACE 
ANTHONY WEST IS STILL HAVING 
DIFFICULTY GETTING HIS HEAD AROUND 
THAT BIKE 
JOHN HOPKINS GOT HIS 
FIRST PODIUM POSITION HERE LAST 
YEAR ON THE SUZUKI 
LORENZO THE 
BIRTHDAY BOY STILL IN FOURTH PLACE 
HE IS LAPPING VERY CONSISTENTLY 
JUST UNDER TWO MINUTES AND SIX 
SECONDS 
IT WILL BE MORE THAN A SECONDS CREDIT TO HIM IF HE FINISHES FOURTH DOESN'T NEED THE SLIPSTREAM LOOK HE'S GOOD ON THE BRAKES AS WELL 
PEDROSA REMEMBER VALENTINO ROSSI 
TWO YEARS AGO HE BURNT HIS FRONT 
TYRE HE WAS BREAKING SO HARD TO 
THAT OF THE FRONT TYRE DELAMINATED 
AND A BIG CHUNK WENT OUT OF IT AND 
IT BLEW THE FRONT GARDEN OUT 
GUARD 
EXTRAORDINARY STRESSES OUR GUARD CIRCUIT LIKE THIS PUTS ON MACHINES 
THE CENTRE WHEN THEY ARE BRAKING FIVE LAPS TO GO WHO IS YOUR MONEY ON 
I JUST AT HOWICK HUNCH THAT A ON VALENTINO ROSSI HAS ENOUGH UP HIS 
SLEEVE I JUST HAD A HUNCH ANOTHER WHITE LINE FOR COLIN 
EDWARDS THERE WIDE A LINE HE HE WILL BE VERY CROSS WITH HERSELF HE 
WAS AN HOUR PAUL SECA HERE IS 
NICKY HAYDEN WORKING AS HARD AS IF 
YOU LIKE AS YOU LIKE 
HE IS 
SITTING IN TENTH PLACE IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP ONCE AGAIN DANI PEDROSA NOT REALLY 
OPTING TO TRY AND GET IN THE TALE 
OF ROSSI PEDROSA TRYING TO PULL IT 
APART 
ROSSI PUT SO BUT SINCE THE APART FASTEST LAP THAT IS CLOSE TO THE 
LAP RECORD 
THAT IS GETTING A REAL 
ONE 
JUST ONE HUNDREDTH OF A SECOND ONE OFF THE LAP RECORD HELD BY THE MAN 
WHO IS CHASING HIM DANI PEDROSA 
ROSSI HAS LEFT IT UNTIL NOW AND IS 
NOW PUTTING THE HAMMER DOWN CAN IT 
PEDRO'S THAT BRAKE IT THAT IS THE 
KEY CAN PEDROSA LOOKS TO ME LIKE HE HAS STRETCHED 
ENOUGH OUT THERE CAN DANI PEDROSA 
OR RESPOND TO VALENTINO ROSSI WHO 
HAS JUST A SET OF THE FASTEST LAP 
AND THEY ASKED US TO IT AGAIN HE 
HAS NOW BROKEN THE LAP RECORD HE 
HAS JUST DONE IT AGAIN ROSSI HAS 
REALLY GOT A BATH HAMMERED DOWN HE HE DOESN'T LOOK AS THOUGH PEDROSA IS 
IN 
A POSITION TO MUG HIM VERITIES VERITIES A NEW LAP RECORD BY VALENTINO ROSSI BEAR IT IS THIS 
IS THE FIRST THE BARD TERRACE IS READY BENEFITING FROM WHICH IT FROM ISSUE LED TO BRIDGESTONE TYRES THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT 
VALENTINO ROSSI IS BENEFITING FROM 
HIS JUMP FROM MICHELIN TO 
BRIDGESTONE TYRES THESE ARE TRIPLE 
COMPOUND TYRES DIFFERENT ON THE 
LEFT RIGHT AND A MEDAL AND THE 
MIDDLE 
FANTASTIC STUFF ARE REALLY MIDDLE GOOD BIT OF RACING EVERY TIME WE 
TURN ROUND HE IS HAVING ANOTHER 
BUS STOP VERY COMPETITIVE RIDING 
GREAT TO SEE NICKY HAYDEN ADDING TO 
RESPOND HAVING TO RESPOND NICKY 
HAS JUST GOT THE SIXTH PLACE BACK 
AGAIN AND IT THERE IS COLIN AND 
WHO IS UP AND DOWN LIKE A YO YO IS 
WORKING AS HARD AS IT CAN INTO 
THAT TIGHT RIGHT HANDER AGAIN YOU YOU HAVE ONLY GOT TO MISS YOUR BRAKING 
BY A FRACTION AND IT CAN BE SUCH A 
BIG PENALTY BUT IN A ROSSI'S MANAGER GIVING HIM OF A HURRY UP A 
VALENTINO ROSSI'S THAT GAP AT THE FRONT IS A ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT SECONDS CAPIROSSI IS CHASING A COLIN EDWARDS VALENTINO ROSSI ABOUT TO EDWARDS TAKE HIS FIRST WIN FOR SUCH A LONG 
TIME 
AS WE SIT HERE HE IS EQUAL TIME FIRST AT THE MOMENT BUT DANI 
PEDROSA IS GOING TO GO AWAY THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP LEAD AFTER THIS EVEN 
FISHING HIS SECOND PLACE AS HE DOES 
BUT IT WILL NOT HEARD VALENTINO 
ROSSI'S CHAMPIONSHIP HOPES HE IS 
IN THIRD NOT HURT SIXTY ONE POINTS 
APIECE FOR PEDROSA AND STONER IF 
ALL THINGS FINISH AS THEY ARE NOW 
PEDROSA WILL WALK AWAY CHAMPIONSHIP 
LEADER 
THE LAST TIME AT VALENTINO LEADER ROSSI ONE WAS BACK IN PORTUGAL LAST 
YEAR THE LAST TIME VALENTINO 
ROSSI WON WORKING AS HARD AS IT POSSIBLY CAN THE GAP IS ENORMOUS THERE FROM 
CASEY STONER BACK TO VALENTINO 
ROSSI AS A CROSS THE LINE HE IS FIFTEEN 
SECONDS ADRIFT OF VALENTINO AND 
THIRTEEN AWAY FROM PEDROSA AS THEY 
CROSS THE LIBELS BUT HE IS 
COMFORTABLY AWAY FROM THE MAN IN 
FOURTH PLACE LORENZO ADDING IT WILL 
BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR MARCO 
MELANDRI I THINK 
IT WILL BE LIKE 
A WIN FOR MARCO MELANDRI TO BE ANY 
WAY IN THE TOP SIX 
TONI ELIAS 
HAVING A VERY GOOD WIN HERE AT SIX 
SURREY TENTH PLACE LORENZO HAS HAD A DUST UP WITH 
CAPIROSSI AND FINDS HERSELF BACK IN 
NINTH 
YOU WOULD NOT RULE OUT NINTH VALENTINO ROSSI FOR ANOTHER 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
ABSOLUTELY IF YOU CHAMPIONSHIP NEVER BET AGAINST THEM NEVER 
RULE HIM OUT 
SIXTY TWO RACE WINS IT'S 
ABOUT TO BE SIXTY THREE COLIN EDWARDS CALLS 
HIM THAT THE GOAT THE GREATEST OF 
ALL TIME WE ARE ON BOARD WITH THE ORANGE 
TART WHICH IS DANI PEDROSA INTO 
THE BRAKING ZONE ORANGE DOT SO LORENZO WHO WAS LEADING THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP ON EQUAL POINTS WITH 
PEDROSA OR ON NUMBERS OF WINS WILL 
DROP BACK AFTER THIS BUT STILL A 
VERY CREDITABLE PERFORMANCE THE LAST LAP FOR VALENTINO ROSSI 
AN ENORMOUS GAP NOW THIRTY SIX SECONDS 
THE LAST LAP FOR HIM WAS WAY OVER 
ONE SECOND QUICKER THAN DANI 
PEDROSA THERE COMES LORENZO STILL NOT A 
BAD BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR HIM WHY 
DOES THINK THAT WHEN HE WAS LYING 
IN HOSPITAL ON FRIDAY ABOUT THINK 
HE WOULD EVER THINK HE HAD A CHANCE 
OF FINISHING FOR FIAT I DON'T 
THINK THAT WHEN HE WAS LYING IN 
HOSPITAL ON FRIDAY 
VALENTINO ROSSI 
TALK ABOUT CONTROL HE HAS KEPT 
COOL PEDROSA WAS THINKING HE 
REALLY HAD GOT HIM THIS TIME AND 
WHEN HE THOUGHT IT WAS IN THE BACK 
HE 
HAS GONE LIKE ROAD RUNNER HE HE HAS KEPT AN EYE IS EVEN PACE AND 
THEN HE KICKED IN SETTING THE 
FASTEST LAP OF THE RACE AND NICE 
EVEN PACE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF CELEBRATIONS 
GOING ON IN HIS CAMP IT HAS BEEN 
SIX RACES SINCE HE WON IT WILL BE 
HIS FIRST VICTORY WITH BRIDGESTONE 
TYRES AND WHAT A SEASON FOR YAMAHA 
FOR THAT MATTER 
THEY HAVE HAD TO 
KEEP THEIR HEADS DOWN KEEP 
CONCENTRATING AND IT IS PAYING OFF 
THIS IS THE LONG BACK STRAIGHT ONE 
MORE TIME WITH FEELING 
THE TWENTY NINE 
YEAR OLD ITALIAN TAKES HE HAS 
GOT A THREE QUARTERS LEFT NOW TO 
TAKE THAT WIN IT WILL BE HIS SIXTY THIRD 
WIN HE DOES NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
THAT DOES HE 
HE IS BACK BY BY INDEED THE INSOUCIANT CROSSING OF 
THE LAST CORNER VALENTINO ROSSI 
TAKES THE WIN IN CHINA JUST BEHIND 
HIM IS DANI BUT ROSE AND HERE COMES 
THE REIGNING CHAMPION CASEY STONER 
DANI PEDROSA HE WILL GET A GREAT 
SPOT ON THE PODIUM 
CASEY STONEY 
NEEDED THOSE POINTS AFTER HIS POOR 
RESULTS IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL 
LORENZO WILL FEEL LIKE A WINNER IN 
FOURTH ACROSS THE LINE MARCO MELANDRI 
FANTASTIC STUFF FROM HIM THESE 
GUYS ARE STILL GOING AT IT HAMMER 
AND TONGS STILL SQUABBLING WITH 
THE OTHERS VALENTINO ROSSI HAVING A LITTLE 
BREATHER HE TAKES HIS HELMET OFF 
AND JUST ANNOUNCES THAT HE HAS WON 
THE RACE HIS SIXTY THIRD HE HAS SET A 
NEW LAP RECORD HERE THE MAN IS 
BACK HE IS KISSING IT TALKING TO IT RELIEF ALL ROUND REALLY FOR A LOT 
OF DIFFERENT REASONS 
FOR EVERYBODY 
INVOLVED REALLY FOR THE CREW IT 
WAS A GAMBLE TO SWITCH TYRE BRANDS 
WE WILL WAIT AND SEE IF IT WAS THE 
RIGHT WAY TO GO BUT HE HAD A HUGE 
AMOUNT UP HIS SLEEVE WHEN PUSH CAME 
TO SHOVE AND HE WAS ABLE TO SHOVE 
A BRIDGESTONE SORT OF CIRCUIT IF 
THERE WAS EVER A TIME FOR 
BRIDGESTONE TO SHINE ON HIGH 
SPEED CIRCUIT LIKE THIS THIS IS IT 
YES I WOULD SAY IT IS A 
BRIDGESTONE SO GOOD AT THE LAST 
TWO THEY KNEW THEY WOULD STRUGGLE 
NOW THEY HAVE THIS UNDER THEIR BELT 
THEY HAVE ALL WORKED ON GETTING THE 
CHASSIS SET UP WITH THAT 
BRIDGESTONE TYRE IT IS THE BIGGEST 
ELEMENT OF ANY MOTOR CYCLE YOU CAN 
CHAIN SUSPENSION WAS POWER BUT 
TYRES ARE THE BIGGEST ELEMENT 
YOU CAN CHANGE SUSPENSION HORSE 
POWER HE FINISHES SECOND BUT HE LEADS 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
CERTAINLY DOES 
CASEY STONER WILL BE SCRATCHING HIS 
HEAD THE BIRD HE THOUGHT HE HAD 
EVERYTHING CRACK A LITTLE BIT 
HE DID NOT REALLY LOOKED 
COMFORTABLE FROM WORD GO THE FIRST 
COUPLE OF LAPS LOOKED GOOD BUT I 
THINK HE MIGHT HAVE A FRONT TYRE 
ISSUE I DO NOT KNOW WE WILL TALK 
TO HIM IT DID NOT LOOK SO CLEVER 
TO ME AT THE FRONT END LORENZO COMING IN FROM A LONG COOL 
DOWN LAP 
ONE OF THE SECOND LONGEST 
LAPS WE HAD AND A MASS OF THE LONG 
STRAIGHT MASSIVELY I MIX AT THIS CIRCUIT WITH JAPAN I 
DO NOT KNOW WHERE I AM 
IT IS 
SUNDAY 
THANK GOODNESS I HAVE YOU SUNDAY AS MY GUIDING LIGHT 
THIS MAN HAS 
PUT JORGE LORENZO ON THE TRACK 
TODAY 
BUT HE WILL NEVER WALK TODAY AGAIN 
THAT IS HIS DOCTOR A ROUND AGAIN OF APPLAUSE AND SO IT SHOULD BE 
VERY MUCH IN THE HUNT STILL ADD TO 
BE A GAP UNTIL THE NEXT RACE IN LE 
MANS SO HE HAS GOT TIME TO SORT OUT 
HIS AIDES AND PAINS A TWO WEEK 
GAP SO HE WILL SORT OUT HIS ACHES 
AND PAINS 
IF YOU KNOW WHAT IS 
WRONG THEN YOU CAN SORT IT OUT IT 
IS A PARTNERSHIP YES PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE TYRE 
COMPANIES AND THE RIDERS IT IS 
USUALLY DISCUSSED AMONG THE TEAM AT 
THE START WHICH DIRECTION TO GO IN 
BUT IT IS JUST A GUESS BECAUSE 
TEMPERATURES CAN DROP DRAMATICALLY 
JUST LIKE THIS WEEKEND THIS MAN 
HAS A PRETTY BIG BRAIN BOX HE 
SEEMS TO HAVE A BIT EXTRA AT TIMES 
FOR WORKING OUT THE BEST OPTION 
CASEY STONER 
CHIRRUP SUNSHINE 
I WILL MAKE US SOME NICE GUNS WHEN WE 
GET HOME 
CHEER UP I WILL MAKE 
US SOME NICE SCARMAN'S DO YOU EAT 
THEM A BIG WEIGHT OF THAT MAN'S SHOULDERS YES WILL SOMEBODY BRING HIM IN OFF THE TRACK YOUR TIME IS UP O. K. WHAT HAPPENED TO CASEY STONER 
YOU DID NOT LOOK ONE HUNDRED PER CENT COMFORTABLE 
WAS THAT DUE TO THE CHANGING 
CONDITIONS 
NO I MEAN IF WE HAD CONDITIONS GONE OUT WITH THE PRACTICE 
YESTERDAY WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL 
RIGHT I WAS ADVISED TO CHANGE THE 
FEW THINGS BY SOME PEOPLE CHANGED 
THE RACE SELECTION OF TYRES AND I 
WAS NOT COMFORTABLE FROM LAP NUMBER 
ONE THE THING WAS SPINNING DOWN 
THE LEFT SIDE HE DID NOT FEEL GOOD 
WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT IT SIMPLE AND 
NOT TRY TO COMPLICATE THINGS 
NEVERTHELESS BACK ON THE PODIUM BUT ON THE PODIUM IS IMPORTANT WHEN 
WE GO BACK TO EUROPE WITH THAT 
PHRASE COMING UP 
YES BUT THE 
PODIUM IS FAR OFF 
THAT RACE 
COMING UP 
I KNEW THAT GOING INTO 
THE RACE WE WOULD HAVE NEEDED SOME 
TENTHS OF A SECOND BUT WE JUST DID 
NOT HAVE IT L. WILL JUST HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO NEXT WEEKEND SIXTEEN 
SIXTEEN POINTS ANYWAY WELL DONE 
THANK YOU 
HE SET HARD TARGET FOR HIMSELF 
THERE WILL BE SOME BRAINSTORMING 
GOING ON 
WHEN YOU SAY THAT WE WERE 
ADVISED TO CHANGE THE FEW THINGS 
THAT IS CODE FOR THE TYRE MAN TOLD 
ME TO DO IT 
THAT IS CODE FOR IT IS 
NOT MY FAULT 
A USEFUL AFTERNOON 
FOR TONI ELIAS 
DANI PEDROSA WHAT 
IS THE SHUFFLE 
A DIFFICULT RACE 
FOR YOU IN THE END SECOND PLACE 
EXTEND YOUR LEAD IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
YES I AM VERY HAPPY CHAMPIONSHIP ABOUT SECOND PLACE THE RACE WAS 
UNBELIEVABLE NOBODY EXPECTED THIS 
DRY AND EVERY TIME FASTER FASTER 
IN THE END I HAD TO STOP AND 
VALENTINO ROSSI WAS VERY FAST ALL 
THE TIME IN PROVING HE WAS GREAT 
TODAY AND FINALLY WE HAD SECOND 
PLACE WHICH IS UNBELIEVABLE FOR US 
IMPROVING THANKS TO THE TEAM AND 
ALL THE PEOPLE AROUND ME WELL DONE THE SCORECARD FOR DANI PEDROSA YES 
SOLID I THINK HE HAS AS GOOD A 
CHANCE AS ANY OF WINNING A MOTOGP 
CHAMPIONSHIP THIS YEAR THE HONDA 
IS GOOD AND HE IS SOLID A GOOD 
CHANCE WHAT 
THE RACE WINNER CHANCE HAVE TO SAY 
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO 
WIN THIS RACE AND YOU HAVE 
CONGRATULATIONS IT HAS BEEN A LONG 
TIME COMING

PORTUGAL LAST YEAR L. FEEL VERY 
GOOD IN THIS WEEK AND WE GO FASTER 
EVERY PRACTICE THIS MORNING THE 
RAIN BUT WHEN I SEE THAT MAY BE 
BECOMING DRY WE PRAY FOR DRY 
CONDITIONS IT WAS THE FIRST 
VICTORY FOR ME WITH BRIDGESTONE 
ANYWAY THE PACE WAS FANTASTIC WE 
ARE REALLY STRONG 
THE FIRST TIME 
IN A WIRE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE 
TO CONTROL THE RACE HOW YOU WANT TO 
IN A WHILE THERE'S THAT MAKE YOU 
SEE AND YOU CAN CONTROL THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP DOES THAT MAKE YOU 
FEEL LIKE YOU CAN CONTROL THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
IT WAS A FANTASTIC CHAMPIONSHIP FEELING I COULD RIDE THE BIKE AS I 
WANTED 
HE SAYS HE COULD RIDE THE WANTED BIKE AS HE WANTED AND THAT IS 
REALLY IMPORTANT 
HE DID WRITE IT 
JUST AS HE WANTED L. COULD NOT 
BELIEVE SETTING A LAP RECORD THEIR 
ON EIGHTEEN LOOK HOW HARD DANI PEDROSA 
PUSHED HIM 
I THOUGHT HE WAS 
LOOKING COMFORTABLE UNTIL HE 
DROPPED THE SECOND OF HIS LAP TIME THE CURRENT WORLD CHAMPION IS NOT 
HAPPY WITH HIS SET UP LORENZO DID 
A FANTASTIC JOB 
IN FIFTH HE WILL BE 
A REAL PEST A HANDFUL FOR THE 
OTHER GUYS REALLY MAKING A POINT WITH DOVIZIOSO 
A TERRIFIC RUN FOR HIM DOVIZIOSO HE WILL BE HAPPY WITH THAT AND AND MELANDRI 
JUST PLEASED FOR HIM MELANDRI LEAST FOR THE TEAM HE HAS BEEN 
LOOKING FOR THE KEY TO THE LAC 
PLEASED FOR THE TEAM HE HAS BEEN 
LOOKING FOR THE KEY TO THE LOCH HE 
IS GOING TO LE MANS NEXT TIME OUT 
NO REASON WHY HE SHOULDN'T BUILD ON 
WHAT HE HAS GOT AND CARRY IT 
THROUGH 
DANI PEDROSA VERY THROUGH IMPORTANT POINTS FOR HIM HE HAS 
SAID THAT HE IS HAPPY 
IT WAS SOLID 
ENOUGH FOR HIM HE HAS GOT THOSE 
POINTS AND HE IS LEADING THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP A LONG WAY TO GO THIS 
SEASON I THINK DANI PEDROSA IT 
WILL BE PLEASED ABOUT THE FACT THAT 
HE WAS FAST AND WET CONDITIONS 
IN 
HE MUST HAVE BEEN READING HIS IN UNCLE STEVE'S REPORT CARD 
I THINK 
SO 
NICE WHEN THEY TAKE NOTICE SO ISN'T IT NOBODY STANDS UP ON THE 
BUS FOR ME A GOOD AFTERNOON FOR 
VALENTINO ROSSI DANI LEADING THE CHAMPIONSHIP NOT 
A BAD WAY TO START YOUR SUNDAY WAS

BETTER THAN GOING OUT JOGGING ALL 
FROM US IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS WE 
WILL BE BACK IN EUROPE ON OUR 
NORMAL CHANNEL AT THE NORMAL TIME 
B. B. C. TWO AT TWELVE THIRTY P. M. IT HAS BEEN A GREAT DAY IN CHINA
