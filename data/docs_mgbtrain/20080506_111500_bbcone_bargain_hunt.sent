WHAT WE'VE GOT IS SALT GLAZED STONEWARE O. K. 
WE'VE GOT A PATENT MARK HERE FOR A COMPANY LONDON MADE

AND IN A POSH INTERIOR WITH FLOWERS IN IT'S A POT REALLY 
DO YOU KNOW HOW THEY WOULD HAVE USED IT I DON'T KNOW 
ON THE OTHER SIDE WE'VE GOT THESE PIERCED HOLES PERFORATIONS IN THIS SALT GLAZED STONEWARE BASE 
THE STALLHOLDER MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE US AN IDEA 
TELL ME ANY IDEAS WHERE THIS OBJECT CAME FROM 
YES WELL ORIGINALLY I BOUGHT IT IN AUCTION BUT APPARENTLY IT HAD BEEN FOUND IN AN OLD STREAM 
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY FULL OF MUD WHEN I BOUGHT IT 
AND I THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN A WATERCRESS STREAM 
SORT OF AN AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT REALLY THANK YOU 
RESEARCH IS SO IMPORTANT 
I ONCE SAW A JUG WITH A C. D. MONOGRAM ON WHICH WE DISCOVERED WAS CHARLES DICKENS 
WHICH TURNED A FIVE JUG INTO A FIVE THOUSAND JUG WOW 
NOT ON THAT SAME LEVEL BUT SOMETHING WHICH WITH RESEARCH COULD BE QUITE INTERESTING 
I THINK WE CAN BUY IT FOR LET'S SAY TWENTY FIVE 
SHOW IT IN THE AUCTION GUIDE THIRTY TO FORTY AND IT GIVES IT A START 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD O. K. YEAH SHALL WE TRY I'LL ASK THE LADY 
THE BLUES GOT THE FILTER FOR A PURE TWENTY FIVE SMACKERS

JUST LOOK AT THAT 
IT'S A LOCKET BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
IT'S MADE OF SOLID SILVER BECAUSE IT'S HALLMARKED BUT IT'S GOT AN INDISTINCT MARK 
COULD BE BIRMINGHAM NINETEEN SIXTY TWO COULD BE BIRMINGHAM NINETEEN SIXTY SIX 
AND THERE I THINK LIES THE HINT TO WHY THIS THING WAS MADE 
IMAGINE YOU'RE AN ARDENT MERSEYBEAT FAN 
YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE TO THE CAVERN YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN RINGO STARR 
AND THOUGHT I WANT A SET OF SOLID SILVER DRUMS LIKE HIS 
AND BE SO INSPIRED THAT YOU CAME OUT IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO 
AND YOU COMMISSIONED YOUR OWN SOLID SILVER LOCKET IN THE FORM OF A SET OF DRUMS 
YOU THEN MIGHT HAVE PRESENTED IT TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND 
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED I'M SURE TO HAVE A SET OF DRUMS AROUND HER NECK 
THEY'RE BEAUTIFULLY MADE 
YOU'VE GOT TWO SIDE DRUMS AND ON TOP OF THAT SIDE DRUM ARE SOME NICELY MADE STICKS 
THE CENTRE DRUM WHICH HAS GOT ANOTHER DRUMSTICK APPLIED TO THE TOP ALL IN SOLID SILVER 
WHAT'S MORE IT'S AVAILABLE TODAY 
IT COULD BE YOURS FOR THIRTY 
BOOM BOOM 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON GIRLS 
I THINK THEY'RE VERY ELEGANT VERY BE A U. T. I. FU L. 
THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO CHECK WITH A STICK RIGHT HEIGHT 
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE A PAIR 
UNLESS IT'S A MAN WITH A SHORT LEG THAT'S A SHORT PERSON'S STICK 
WELL IT'S THE RIGHT HEIGHT FOR ME 
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S BEEN CUT DOWN HASN'T IT CLEARLY 
DATE WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY DATE TO

DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THEY ARE THEY ARE TWENTY FIVE EACH 
AND I THINK TWENTY FIVE EACH TOO DEAR AREN'T THEY COULD YOU GET IT DOWN YEAH I MIGHT GET HANDBAGGED 
SO DO YOU WANT TO BUY JUST THE ONE OR DO YOU WANT TO BUY THE TWO OR WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO

ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN O. K. GIVE ME ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THERE YOU GO CHARLES LOTS OF LOLLY TIM ISN'T IT 
CERTAINLY IS LOTS OF TAT BUT MORE TREASURE I HOPE 
GOT ANY IDEAS MANY IDEAS GOOD 
JUST SPEND IT WISELY EE UP 
FANCY A WALK 
THIS IS THE EAST GATE OF CHESTER'S MAGNIFICENT CITY WALLS PUT UP TO PROTECT THE CITY 
IT RUNS ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY FOR TWO MILES AROUND THE CITY CENTRE 
AND WALKING AROUND IT IS A GREAT WAY TO SEE WHAT THE ROMANS DID FOR US 
WITHOUT STOPPING MYSELF OR THE CAMERA 
LET'S SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES ME TO GET ROUND 
AND TAKE IN SOME HIGHLIGHTS LIKE THE FAMOUS EASTGATE CLOCK 
IT'S THE SECOND MOST PHOTOGRAPHED CLOCK IN THE U. K. AFTER BIG BEN 
IT WAS CONSTRUCTED LOCALLY 
AND PUT UP FOR QUEEN VICTORIA'S JUBILEE IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN 
NOW I WANT YOU TO CHECK VERY CAREFULLY THE TIME 
IT'S ABOUT TEN TO TEN LET'S SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES US FOR THE WALK 
THE ORIGINAL WALLS WOULD HAVE BEEN BUILT OF EARTH AND TURF 
WITH A WOODEN WALKWAY ON TOP 
THEY WERE REBUILT BY THE ROMANS IN SANDSTONE 
AND REPAIRED DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN THE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTIES 
AND AGAIN IN THE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURIES 
HERE'S CHESTER CASTLE BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND SEVENTY BY THE NORMANS 
IT'S A MOTTE AND BAILEY CASTLE 
MOTTE BEING THE HILL RISING UP FROM THE OUTER BAILEY 
IN MORE PEACEFUL TIMES IN THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS IT HAD AN UNUSUAL USE 
IT BECAME CHESTER MINT PRODUCING THE NEW STANDARDISED SILVER COINAGE 
THAT'S INTERESTING ISN'T IT 
THE WEST WALL ONCE PROVIDED THE CITY WITH ACCESS TO THE BUSY PORT OF CHESTER 
BUT NATURE HAS TAKEN ITS COURSE 
AND THE RIVER NO LONGER RUNS ALONG THE WALL 
THIS IS A WATCHTOWER AT THE NORTH WEST CORNER OF THE CITY 
ORIGINALLY THE RIVER WAS VERY CLOSE BY 
BUT IN THE MIDDLE AGES IT STARTED TO SILT UP 
SO THEY BUILT A SUBSIDIARY TOWER CALLED THE WATER TOWER 
DOWN THERE ALONG THAT SPUR WALL TO PROTECT THE CITY 
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THE DEE CONTINUED TO SILT UP 
AND IT'S NOW ALSO WELL AND TRULY HIGH AND DRY 
A STRANGE DISCOVERY WAS MADE IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS 
WHEN THE NORTH WALL WAS REPAIRED 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ROMAN TOMBSTONES HAD BEEN USED TO RESURFACE THE WALL 
THAT'S VERY MACABRE BUT THE TOMBSTONES FOUND ALONG HERE 
ARE NOW SAFELY IN THE MUSEUM 
THIS IS KING CHARLES'S TOWER WHERE KING CHARLES I STOOD IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
AND WATCHED HIS ARMY BEING DEFEATED TWO MILES AWAY TO THE SOUTH ON ON 
COMING NEAR FULL CIRCLE CHESTER CATHEDRAL DOMINATES THE CITY 
SO HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO REALLY WALK THE WALLS 
HERE WE ARE BACK AT EASTGATE CLOCK 
I MAKE THAT TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST 
THAT'S THIRTY SIX MINUTES TO COMPLETE THIS RIGOROUS EXERCISE 
WANDERING ALL THE WAY AROUND THE WALLS OF CHESTER CITY 
A GOOD DEAL QUICKER FOR YOU THOUGH 
WATCHING BARGAIN HUNT AT HOME FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR ARMCHAIRS 
ANYWAY WHILE I GET MY BREATH BACK IT'S TIME FOR THE AUCTION
