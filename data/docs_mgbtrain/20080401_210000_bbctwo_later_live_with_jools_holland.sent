OF MY TUNE WE SHOPPED IT AROUND 
EVENTUALLY PETER ASHER HEARD IT 
HE PLAYED IT FOR PAUL MCCARTNEY AND 
GEORGE HARRISON 
SO YOU WERE 
RECORDING IN LONDON AT THE SAME 
TIME 
I WAS L. L. WAS RECORDING IN TIME TRIDENT STUDIOS WHILE THE LADS WERE 
MAKING THE WHITE ALBUM L. WAS USING 
THE WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED ONE OF 
THEIR MAR SOON SESSIONS I WOULD 
SCURRY IN AND TRY AND PUT DOWN A 
COUPLE OF TRACKS BEFORE THEY CAME 
BACK 
WE HAVE SOME FOOTAGE WITH AN BACK APPROPRIATE SONG OF THAT TIME 
DO YOU BELIEVE IN A LOVE AT FIRST 
SIGHT SIGHT YES I AM CERTAIN IT HAPPENS ALL 
THE TIME 
WHAT DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU TURN OUT 
THE LIGHT

THERE IS A YOUNG COWBOY HE LIVES ON THE RANGE 
HIS HORSE AND HIS CATTLE ARE HIS ONLY COMPANIONS 
HE WORKS IN THE SADDLE AND HE SLEEPS IN THE CANYONS 
WAITING FOR SUMMER HIS PASTURES TO CHANGE 
AND AS THE MOON RISES HE SITS BY HIS FIRET 
THINKING ABOUT WOMEN AND GLASSES OF BEER 
AND CLOSING HIS EYES AS THE DOGIES RETIRE 
HE SINGS OUT A SONG WHICH IS SOFT BUT IT'S CLEAR 
AS IF MAYBE SOMEONE COULD HEAR 
GOODNIGHT YOU MOONLIGHT LADIES ROCKABYE SWEET BABY JAMES 
DEEP GREENS AND BLUES ARE THE COLOURS I CHOOSE 
WON'T YOU LET ME GO DOWN IN MY DREAMS 
AND ROCKABYE SWEET BABY JAMES 
THE FIRST OF DECEMBER WAS COVERED WITH SNOW 
AND SO WAS THE TURNPIKE FROM STOCKBRIDGE TO BOSTON 
LORD THE BERKSHIRES SEEMED DREAM LIKE 
ON ACCOUNT OF THAT FROSTING 
WITH TEN MILES BEHIND ME AND TEN THOUSAND MORE TO GO 
THERE'S A SONG THAT THEY SING WHEN THEY TAKE TO THE HIGHWAY 
A SONG THAT THEY SING WHEN THEY TAKE TO THE SEA 
A SONG THAT THEY SING OF THEIR HOME IN THE SKY 
MAYBE YOU CAN BELIEVE IT IF IT HELPS YOU TO SLEEP 
BUT SINGING WORKS JUST FINE FOR ME 
SO GOODNIGHT YOU MOONLIGHT LADIES

DEEP GREENS AND BLUES ARE THE COLOURS I CHOOSE
