IF YOU'VE GOT A WINNER IN YOUR WARDROBE CHARMS HIDING IN YOUR CHEST 
UNWANTED HEIRLOOMS IN THE BEDROOM FLOG IT IS THE SHOW FOR YOU 
TODAY FLOG IT COMES FROM TUNBRIDGE WELLS 
A TOWN WHICH OWES ITS EXISTENCE TO A DRUNKEN NOBLEMAN SOME FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIX A YOUNG DUDLEY LORD NORTH WAS MAKING HIS WAY BACK HOME 
ON HORSEBACK HAVING BEEN DRINKING AND PARTYING ALL NIGHT IN LONDON 
STILL FEELING THE WORSE FOR WEAR 
HE CHANCED UPON THE WATERS OF THE CHALYBEATE SPRING 
HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND DRANK THE WATERS TO QUENCH HIS THIRST 
LORD NORTH FELT SO REJUVENATED AFTER DRINKING THE COOL IRON RICH SPRING WATERS 
THAT HE DECLARED IT HEALTH GIVING TO HIS FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES 
AS WORD SPREAD OF THE WATER'S SUPPOSED HEALTH GIVING PROPERTIES 
IT SOON ATTRACTED THE CREAM OF SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SOCIETY EAGER TO TRY IT FOR THEMSELVES 
A SETTLEMENT GREW AROUND THE SPRING AND TUNBRIDGE WELLS WAS BORN 
WELL WORD HAS SPREAD THAT FLOG IT IS IN TOWN AND WE DO HAVE A MASSIVE QUEUE 
LET'S SEE IF OUR EXPERTS JAMES LEWIS AND CHARLIE ROSS CAN PICK OUT THE CREAM OF ANTIQUES 
HELLO HELLO WHAT A WONDERFUL BOX 
NOW IS THIS A FAMILY PIECE OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE BOUGHT RECENTLY FROM AUCTION 
MY GRAN RECENTLY GAVE IT TO MY DAD 
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG SHE'S HAD IT 
MY DAD YEARS AGO WAS IN THE NAVY SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE BOUGHT IT BECAUSE OF THAT BRILLIANT 
IT GOES FURTHER BACK THAN THAT 
IT'S A WONDERFUL PIECE OF TYPICAL SAILOR WORK 
TRADITIONALLY PEOPLE SAY THAT SAILORS WHILE THEY WERE AT SEA 
WOULD TURN THEIR HAND TO SCRIMSHAWS AND WOOL WORK PICTURES AND THIS MARQUETRY ON WRITING BOXES 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE SAILORS HAD VERY LITTLE SPACE ON BOARD SHIP 
TO ACTUALLY BE WORKING SOMETHING THIS BIG I THINK WOULD BE QUITE UNLIKELY 
THESE COME IN VARIOUS SHAPES AND FORMS 
THE MORE SHIPS THAT ARE ON THESE WRITING BOXES THE MORE VALUABLE THEY ARE 
SOME JUST HAVE ONE ON THE COVER LIKE THIS OTHERS HAVE THEM ALL AROUND THE SIDES 
IF WE LOOK INSIDE HERE WE'VE GOT SOME ALTERATIONS TO IT 
WHENEVER YOU'VE HAD ANYTHING ALTERED WITH IT IT REDUCES THE VALUE 
THIS LEATHER WRITING SURFACE IS TWENTIETH CENTURY 
IF WE LOOK IN HERE THERE SHOULD BE A SECRET COMPARTMENT UNDER HERE 
LITTLE COMPARTMENTS AT THE TOP HERE BUT THAT AGAIN DOESN'T WORK SO THAT REDUCES IT 
THERE SHOULD BE TWO INKWELLS FOR RED INK AND FOR BLACK THEY'RE MISSING 
AND A PEN TRAY IN THE CENTRE 
SO THIS OLD BOX HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS 
SOMEBODY'S HAD A GO AT RESTORING IT BUT THEY HAVEN'T GONE THE WHOLE HOG 
YOU SEE THIS WOOD AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX 
THIS IS KNOWN AS A ROSEWOOD THIS STARTED TO BE USED AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY 
YOU CAN IDENTIFY IT BY VERY DARK ALMOST BLACK STREAKS NEXT TO PALE BROWN 
NOW DO YOU KNOW WHY IT WAS CALLED ROSEWOOD 
NO I DON'T BECAUSE WHEN THESE GUYS WERE OVER IN SOUTH AMERICA AND OVERSEAS 
CUTTING THESE FANTASTIC TREES DOWN 
WHEN THEY CUT THIS TREE DOWN IT SMELLED OF ROSES 
RIGHT THAT'S HOW IT GOT ITS NAME ROSEWOOD 
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A VERY PLAIN WOOD THAT HAS TAKEN A STAIN 
THIS WOULD'VE BEEN BRIGHT VIVID BLUE WHEN IT WAS NEW 
AND A WOOD THAT TAKES A BLUE STAIN WELL IS SYCAMORE 
SO THIS IS LIKELY TO BE SYCAMORE 
ALL THIS WOULD'VE BEEN BRIGHT YOU SEE SOME OF THE COLOURS LEFT IN THE FLAG HERE 
WE'VE JUST GOT BLUE AND HINTS OF RED LEFT 
ALL THE SAILS WOULD HAVE BEEN BRIGHT 
IT WOULDN'T HAVE LOOKED ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHEN IT WAS NEW IT WOULD'VE BEEN REALLY BRIGHT 
NOW IF WE LOOK AT THE SIDES 
BIG PANELS OF BURR WALNUT AGAIN VERY EXPENSIVE VENEER 
SO THIS HAS GOT EVERYTHING ON IT YOU WANT TO SEE YEAH 
DATE WELL WE'VE GOT A PLAQUE ON THE FRONT HERE 
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE OUT WHAT IT SAYS 
ERM NO JUST THE DATE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN YEAH 
I MEAN I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ORIGINAL ENGRAVING 
I THINK SOMEBODY'S PUT THAT IN THERE AT A LATER DATE 
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT'S THE RIGHT SORT OF PERIOD I THINK THIS IS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY IT COULD BE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY 
BUT THE QUALITY OF THE ENGRAVING IS JUST PRICKED IN WITH A PIN 
SO THAT'S WHY IT'S RUBBED AWAY SO EASILY 
A STANDARD WRITING BOX IS WORTH THIRTY TO FIFTY 
THE MORE SHIPS YOU ADD THE BETTER THEY ARE ONE SHIP WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WELL I'M HOPING IT'S GOING TO BE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED 
ABSOLUTELY BANG ON I THINK AN ESTIMATE OF TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
ALL RIGHT O. K. YEAH AS IT'S A FAMILY PIECE 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL IT AND NOT PASS IT DOWN A GENERATION 
WELL BECAUSE MY DAD'S GOT SOME OTHER BOXES THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE FAMILY AS WELL AND IT JUST 
IT'S QUITE BIG ISN'T IT TAKES UP A BIT OF ROOM 
LET'S TAKE IT TO AUCTION SEE WHAT HAPPENS I THINK IT'LL DO WELL 
THERE ARE ALWAYS COLLECTORS FOR MARINE RELATED ITEMS 
SO AS A WORKBOX FIFTY QUID 
BUT WITH THAT ON THE TOP TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED OH RIGHT 
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS O. K. THEN O. K. LOVELY 
MICHAEL AND MARION YOU HAVE BROUGHT QUALITY TODAY 
THIS IS MAGNIFICENTLY PAINTED 
IT REALLY IS AND I THINK IT'S NOT ON CANVAS OR PAPER 
IT'S ACTUALLY ON PORCELAIN DID YOU INHERIT IT 
NO NO I BOUGHT IT ONLY 
I SHOULD'VE THOUGHT IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS 
OH DANGEROUS IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS 
IT MIGHT BE A BIT MORE THAN THAT 
THIS WILL BE AN INTERESTING TEST OF VALUATION WON'T IT 
AND YOU BOUGHT IT IN A SHOP 
NO AT THE ARDINGLY ANTIQUES FAIR 
THE FAIR SO YOU WENT OFF TO A FAIR TO BUY THIS 
IS THIS SOMETHING YOU DO WEEKLY MONTHLY NO IRREGULARLY 
BUT I LIKE TO GO TO ANTIQUE FAIRS NOT THAT IRREGULARLY REALLY 
DO YOU KNOW WHEN HE'S GOING 
DOES HE SAY I'M JUST GOING DOWN THE SHOPS 
THEY'RE ON A CALENDAR WHEN HE'S GOING HAS HE 
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS 
I JUST LET HIM GO HE ENJOYS IT SO MUCH 
WELL WE'LL COME BACK TO WHAT YOU PAID FOR IT 
I MEAN I'M DICING WITH DEATH HERE 
I CAN'T SEE A SIGNATURE ON THE FRONT 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENGLISH IT'S GOING TO BE GERMAN I THINK ALMOST CERTAINLY YEAH 
LOOKING AT THE CLOTHING AND THE FACT THAT IT IS ON PORCELAIN WHICH THEY DID 
I THINK WE'LL FIND IT'S LATE NINETEENTH OR BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IT'S AROUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
I LIKED THE PAINTING OF THIS CHATELAINE THEY CALL IT 
YES THAT'S RIGHT THE CHATELAINE HERE HOLDING SCISSORS NEEDLEWORK ITEMS ALL SORTS OF THINGS THE LADY 
WOULD NEED ROUND ABOUT THE HOUSE FOR DAY TO DAY USE 
IT'S IN FABULOUS CONDITION THERE DON'T APPEAR TO BE ANY CRACKS OR CHIPS CRAZING 
IT'S IN WHAT WE CALL A HOGARTH FRAME A MORE MODERN FRAME 
BUT I THINK PROBABLY THE GILT FRAME IS A LITTLE TOO HEAVY FOR THE PICTURE ITSELF 
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT REFRAMED BUT I DON'T THINK THAT MATTERS IF WE TURN IT ROUND 
SOMEBODY'S WRITTEN IN BIRO HERE 
THE YOUNG MOTHER BY ROBERT BEYSCHLAG 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT TO NINETEEN OH THREE AND THAT'S A COPY OF THIS LABEL HERE 
THIS IS ENCOURAGING THIS IS QUITE AN OLD LABEL 
I'M GOING TO TRY TAKING IT OUT 
GERMAN WRITING BECAUSE THERE'S AN UMLAUT HERE 
SPROSSLING OR SOMETHING I CAN'T TRANSLATE THAT AND I CAN'T EVEN READ THE FIRST WORD 
IT'S QUITE OBVIOUSLY NOT THE ARTIST NO IT IS PROBABLY THE SUBJECT OF THE PICTURE 
SO WE'VE GOT REALLY I THINK AN ATTRIBUTION 
RATHER THAN A DEFINITIVE 
YES 
VALUE IT'S NO GOOD ASKING YOU WHAT YOU THINK IT'S WORTH BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT IT 
I'M GOING TO PUT A VALUE IN TODAY'S MARKET OF TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED ON IT 
I SUPPOSE YOU MIGHT LOOK AT IT AND THINK IT SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE 
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF IT MADE THREE HUNDRED FORTY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY 
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT IN AT TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED WITH A RESERVE AT TWO HUNDRED TO GET IT GOING IN THE MARKET 
IF IT DOESN'T MAKE TWO HUNDRED IT'S NOT WORTH SELLING IN MY OPINION NO 
WHAT DID YOU PAY FOR IT FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED 
CAN YOU DIVULGE THIS INFORMATION IN FRONT OF YOUR WIFE 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YOUR EARS 
I GAVE TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOR IT AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A BARGAIN 
I THINK THAT'S TREMENDOUS 
BEARING IN MIND THAT YOU'RE BUYING AT SAY HALFWAY BETWEEN A RETAIL AND TRADE MARKET SITUATION 
I THINK IN A SHOP YOU'D PAY FIVE HUNDRED OR SIX HUNDRED FOR THAT ALL DAY LONG 
YES I THINK SO SO I THINK YOU'VE DONE WELL 
WE'LL PUT TWO HUNDRED ON IT 
WE'LL AIM FOR THREE HUNDRED WE'LL AIM FOR FOUR HUNDRED 
HE SAID FINGERS CROSSED 
HELLO GILLY HELLO JAMES WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE CONTINENTAL FIGURES 
WHAT ARE THESE DOING IN TUNBRIDGE WELLS 
THEY'RE DUX FIGURES WHICH I BELIEVE ARE FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
YEP THEY WERE IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE AND WHEN HE DIED ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO I INHERITED THEM 
ROYAL DUX IS A FACTORY THAT STARTED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THREE IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
OF COURSE IT WASN'T CZECHOSLOVAKIA IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS BOHEMIA 
THE FACTORY WAS STARTED REALLY FOR DOMESTIC WARE TABLEWARE 
AND EDUARD EICHLER TOOK THE FACTORY OVER ABOUT TWENTY YEARS 
AFTER IT WAS ESTABLISHED AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY AND HE WAS A MODELLER 
AND HE REALLY TURNED THE FACTORY'S FORTUNES AROUND 
IT WAS STRUGGLING WITH THESE TABLEWARES PLATES BOWLS SAUCERS AND THAT TYPE OF THING 
WITH HIS MODELLING SKILLS HE TURNED THE FACTORY AROUND 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THEY WON THE PARIS EXHIBITION SILVER MEDAL 
AND THE NEXT THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE YEARS WAS REALLY THE PERIOD OF TIME WHEN ROYAL DUX WAS IN ITS HEYDAY 
SPECIALISING IN THESE MODELS IN THIS RUSTIC BRONZE AND BRUSHED GILT EFFECT 
THIS IS TYPICAL OF NOT ONLY ROYAL DUX 
BUT THEY WERE COMPETING WITH THE ROYAL WORCESTER FIGURES MADE HERE AT THE SAME TIME 
IF WE TURN THE FIGURES OVER WE SEE THE PINK TRIANGLE MARK 
THAT REALLY IS THE MARK THAT SHOUTS ROYAL DUX 
I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER FACTORY THAT USED THAT 
NICE AND CLEARLY MARKED 
DATE WILL BE AROUND THE HEIGHT OF PRODUCTION OF THESE FIGURES 
AROUND NINETEEN HUNDRED TO NINETEEN TEN SOMETHING AROUND THERE 
HAVE YOU NOTICED THE SPADE ON THIS ONE YES 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN REPLACED YEP HER HAND IS FILLED WITH GLUE 
IT COULD BE THAT THE ORIGINALS WERE MADE OF WOOD RIGHT 
BECAUSE IT IS A SLOT IN THE BOTTOM THERE TO HAVE SOMETHING ATTACHED 
BUT I THINK IT'S FAR MORE LIKELY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A CERAMIC POLE THAT SOMEBODY'S BROKEN AND REPLACED 
HAVING GROWN UP WITH THESE ON THE MANTELPIECE AT HOME 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL THEM 
WELL THEY'RE NOT REALLY THE SORT OF FIGURES THAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE ON MY MANTELPIECE AT HOME AND ALSO 
WE ARE TRYING TO SORT OF SIZE DOWN A BIT 
SO OBVIOUSLY WHATEVER THEY WOULD FETCH WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL 
THEY ARE THE SORT OF THINGS THAT YOU EITHER LOVE OR HATE 
AND THEY GO IN A CERTAIN TYPE OF HOUSE 
IF IT DOESN'T SUIT YOUR INTERIOR THEN I UNDERSTAND 
THEY'RE A BIT TOO GOOD TO BE WRAPPED UP IN A BOX SOMEWHERE 
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE VALUE 
NO IDEA WHATSOEVER 
I THINK AN AUCTION ESTIMATE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SHOULD BE ABOUT THERE FOR THEM 
THE BEST MODELLER FOR ROYAL DUX WAS A CHAP CALLED HEMPEL 
AND FIGURES THAT ARE SIGNED BY HIM DO MAKE CONSIDERABLY MORE 
BUT CONSIDERING THEY'RE NOT SIGNED AND THEY'RE NOT IN BAD CONDITION 
AND THE HEADS HAVEN'T BEEN OFF THAT'S ALWAYS A KILLER 
NO CHIPS AROUND THE BASE AND IN RELATIVELY GOOD CONDITION I THINK TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WOULD BE ABOUT RIGHT 
AND LET'S JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS ON THE DAY 
DOROTHY AND JIM THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS ITEM IN 
WONDERFUL BIT OF TABLE TREEN 
BUT IT DOES CONTAIN A LITTLE HIDDEN GEM DOESN'T IT IT'S A TOOL KIT 
WHOSE IS IT WHOSE FAMILY DOES IT COME FROM 
WELL WE BELIEVE IT COMES FROM MY FAMILY 
MY SISTER GAVE IT ME BECAUSE I SAVE THINGS YEAH 
I MEAN YOU ALWAYS USED TO DO CROCHET IN THEM DAYS DIDN'T YOU EVERYBODY DID 
I MEAN THE LADY OF THE HOUSE HAD TO DO FINE NEEDLEPOINT AS YOU SAY CROCHET KNITTING AND PASS THESE 
SKILLS ON TO THE YOUNG GIRLS AND THAT'S WHY THEY DID LOTS OF NEEDLEWORK SAMPLERS 
THE TOOLS INSIDE HERE ARE VERY VERY FINE IF WE TIP THEM OUT 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THESE 
THEY'RE NOT REALLY CROCHETING NEEDLES THEY LOOK LIKE NEEDLES FOR VERY FINE POINT NEEDLEWORK 
NOT EVEN TURKEY WORK NOT FOR CUSHIONS BUT SOMETHING MUCH FINER LIKE SILK WORK 
OH RIGHT YEAH 
THIS IS REALLY NICE 
BECAUSE THIS IS THE UNIVERSAL HANDLE WHICH GOES IN THE MIDDLE 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SNAP ON TOOLKIT OF TODAY ISN'T IT YEAH 
AND THERE YOU'VE GOT YOUR NEEDLE WITH YOUR HOOK ON THE END 
THEY'RE ALL MADE OF STEEL 
THESE HAVE BEEN GILTED 
THIS IS STEEL BUT IT'S BLUED STEEL 
IT'S BEEN HEATED UP JUST TO MAKE IT LOOK SLIGHTLY DECORATIVE WITH THIS DAMASK TURN ON IT CAN YOU SEE IT 
YEAH WHICH IS WHAT YOU FIND ON GUN BARRELS 
OH RIGHT AND THE VESSEL ITSELF THAT'S MADE OF EBONY AND IT'S IN PERFECT CONDITION 
AND EBONY AGAIN A VERY VALUABLE HARDWOOD IN ITS DAY 
AND I THINK THIS LITTLE VESSEL AND THIS KIT DATES BACK TO AROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY 
JUDGING BY THAT LITTLE FINIAL WHICH IS A NICE ARCHITECTURAL DETAIL 
IT'S SLENDER IT'S NOT THE MIDDLE OF THE VICTORIAN PERIOD 
WHERE EVERYTHING WENT OVER THE TOP THAT'S VERY PRECISE VERY PLAIN 
YEAH IT'S A WONDERFUL LITTLE THING 
IT DOESN'T HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF VALUE THAT'S THE ONLY THING 
BUT ITS VALUE IS IN ITS SOCIAL HISTORY AND WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
AND OBVIOUSLY ITS VALUE TO YOUR FAMILY 
I THINK FOR AUCTION PURPOSES WE COULD PUT 
AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLY THIRTY TO FIFTY ON THIS YEAH 
IT DOESN'T SEEM A LOT OF MONEY DOES IT IT DOESN'T REALLY 
WE COULD PUT A FIXED RESERVE ON IT 
GO ON THEN I KNOW THE COLLECTORS WILL LOVE THIS WILL THEY 
YES IT'LL GO TO SOMEONE THAT REALLY WANTS TO OWN THIS AND LOOK AFTER IT AND CHERISH IT 
PATSY A LITTLE BIRDIE HAS TOLD ME THAT THIS ISN'T AN UNFAMILIAR SURROUNDING FOR YOU IS THAT RIGHT 
THAT'S RIGHT HERE WE ARE IN TUNBRIDGE WELLS AND YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS BUILDING BEFORE 
A FEW TIMES 
DOING WHAT SINGING AND DANCING 
SINGING AND DANCING ON THAT VERY STAGE 
ON THAT VERY STAGE FANTASTIC 
WHEN WAS YOUR LAST PERFORMANCE ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO 
DOING WHAT SINGING TUNBRIDGE WELLS CHORAL SOCIETY 
FANTASTIC THIS SPLENDID CHAP MUST HAVE HAD QUITE A HISTORY 
HE HAS TELL ME ALL ABOUT HIM 
WELL HE WAS GIVEN TO ME BY AN AMERICAN ADMIRER IN A CABARET THAT I WAS IN WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN 
WHERE WAS THAT IN GERMANY 
AND SINCE THEN HE'S TRAVELLED ALL ROUND THE WORLD IN HONG KONG WHERE I LIVED FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS 
AND MY SON TOOK HIM OFF TO UNIVERSITY FOR A MASCOT AND I THOUGHT I'D GOT RID OF HIM 
BUT AFTER HE CAME BACK FROM UNIVERSITY HE GAVE HIM BACK TO ME SO HERE HE IS 
THERE'S NO SENTIMENTAL ATTACHMENT 
NOT REALLY NO I'VE GOT USED TO HIS FACE AFTER NEARLY FIFTY YEARS 
OH REALLY DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS 
APART FROM BEING A MONKEY OR A CHIMPANZEE IN FACT 
DO YOU MEAN A STEIFF YEP IT IS A STEIFF 
UNFORTUNATELY IF I CAN MOVE HIM HERE THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING IN THE LEFT EAR 
NOW THERE IS A LITTLE CLIP MARK DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING THERE 
YES WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT I TOOK IT OUT STRAIGHTAWAY 
YOU TOOK IT OUT STRAIGHTAWAY IT LOOKED PAINFUL SO I TOOK IT OUT 
WELL IT'S SUCH A DISTINCTIVE MODEL I DON'T THINK WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM 
BECAUSE YOU CAN TELL IT'S A STEIFF 
ITS AGE WELL IT WAS OBVIOUSLY BOUGHT NEW SO IT WAS BOUGHT IN WHAT YEAR 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT 
FIFTY EIGHT NOW ALSO THERE WOULD'VE BEEN ANOTHER DISTINCTIVE MARK THERE WOULD'VE BEEN A LABEL 
ACTUALLY YOU CAN SEE WAS THERE AND YOU DID THAT AS WELL YES 
WELL MAY I SAY CONGRATULATIONS FOR RUINING YOUR STEIFF 
FORTUNATELY AS I'VE SAID WE CAN TELL IT IS A STEIFF 
THE CONDITION ISN'T PERHAPS ALL THAT IT MIGHT BE 
I'M AFRAID A LOT OF THE STRAW HAS COME OUT IS IT MOTHS 
I THINK SO I'M SURPRISED IF YOUR SON TOOK HIM TO UNIVERSITY HE'S IN SUCH GOOD CONDITION 
PROBABLY STUCK IN A CUPBOARD LEFT TO THE MOTHS 
WHAT MADE YOU BRING HIM ALONG 
WELL HE WAS GOING IN THE BIN BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS HIM 
IN THE BIN MM 
SO IF I GAVE YOU FIVE P. YOU'D TAKE THAT WOULD YOU A FIVER 
A FIVER WELL I THINK HE'S WORTH A HUNDRED OR TWO 
WOW 
I REALLY DO IN THIS CONDITION IN THAT CONDITION 
SO I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO HERE IS HEDGE MY BETS 
I THINK WE'LL PUT AN ESTIMATE OF ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED 
BUT WE'LL PROBABLY SELL HIM WITHOUT RESERVE SHALL WE YES PLEASE 
HAPPY NO RESERVE NO RESERVE 
SO IF HE MAKES A FIVER I WILL GO BRIGHT RED BUT YOU'LL STILL BE PLEASED YES 
OFF TO AUCTION WE WILL GO OH GREAT 
I THINK WE'LL DO WELL WITH HIM HAS HE GOT A NAME SHELLY SHELLY 
IT'S GOOD TO WELCOME YOU BACK I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AT THE AUCTION 
TODAY'S SALE IS AT THE DREWEATT NEATE AUCTION ROOMS IN TUNBRIDGE WELLS 
AND IN A MOMENT AUCTIONEER DANIEL BRAY IS GOING TO GIVE US HIS OPINION ON SOME OF OUR OWNERS' ITEMS 
BUT FIRST HERE'S A RUN DOWN OF THE ANTIQUES THAT ARE GOING TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
JULIA'S NINETEENTH CENTURY WRITING BOX HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS 
SHE'S STILL HOPING THOUGH TO SEE TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED 
MICHAEL BOUGHT THIS PLAQUE FOR TWO HUNDRED FORTY 
BUT WILL IT MAKE A PROFIT OR LOSS AT THE SALE 
GILLIAN DOESN'T LIKE THE LOOK OF HER ROYAL DUX FIGURES 
SO SHE'S HOPING TO FIND A COLLECTOR WILLING TO PAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
I VALUED DOROTHY AND JIM'S EBONY NEEDLE BOX AT A SPIKY THIRTY TO FIFTY 
AND FINALLY THERE'S NO MORE MONKEYING AROUND 
FOR PATSY'S STEIFF CHIMP VALUED AT ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED 
THIS IS A CRACKING LOT IT BELONGS TO MICHAEL 
IT'S ENAMELS ON PORCELAIN 
IT'S A LOVELY LITTLE PLAQUE 
THE SCENE IS A YOUNG MOTHER HERE 
NOW CHARLIE OUR EXPERT HAS PUT TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED ON THIS 
BUT MICHAEL BOUGHT THIS FOR TWO HUNDRED FORTY 
NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT THEN NO 
I THINK HE PAID ABOUT THE RIGHT MONEY 
BECAUSE WE'VE LOOKED VERY CLOSELY AT THIS UNDER AN EYEGLASS 
AND WE THINK IT MAY BE PAINTED OVER A PRINTED BASE 
AH INDEED 
THAT'S WHY THE IMAGE IS SO GOOD THEN INDEED 
BECAUSE HE'S JUST COPYING A BASIC OUTLINE THAT'S UNDERNEATH 
AND WE SHOULD ACHIEVE THE ESTIMATE OF TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED BUT NO MORE THAN THAT 
SO YOU THINK THE VALUATION IS ABOUT RIGHT I THINK IT SHOULD MAKE WITHIN ESTIMATE 
AND IF IT WAS WHOLLY PAINTED BY THE ARTIST THEN IT COULD MAKE MORE 
ONE THOUSAND PLUS OUR FEELING IS THAT IT PROBABLY IS OVER A PRINTED BASE 
FINGERS CROSSED WE'LL GET MICHAEL HIS MONEY BACK AT LEAST INDEED 
RIGHT WE WANT CASH BACK RIGHT NOW 
A FULL REFUND OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOR MARION AND MICHAEL ON THEIR ENAMEL PLAQUE 
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE THING VALUATION TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED BUT YOU ACTUALLY PAID TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOR THIS ABOUT A YEAR AGO 
I DID YEAH AND I THOUGHT IT WAS REASONABLE YOU DID 
WELL IT LOOKS FANTASTIC QUALITY BUT I DID HAVE A CHAT TO THE AUCTIONEER A LITTLE BIT EARLIER 
HE SEEMS TO THINK IT'S OVER PAINTED ON A PRINT 
BECAUSE HAND PAINTED ENAMELS ON A PLAQUE LIKE THAT OF THAT QUALITY 
SHOULD BE SIX HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND ON A GOOD DAY 
THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT I'D GOT A BARGAIN I DON'T BLAME YOU 
THIS IS IT IT'S GOING UNDER THE HAMMER 
THIS IS THE PORCELAIN PLAQUE AFTER ROBERT BEYSCHLAG 
AND I HAVE COMPETING BIDS HERE AT TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED ANY INTEREST AT TWO HUNDRED TEN

WELL I THINK MY DAD BUT I THINK HE MIGHT TREAT ME FOR BRINGING IT DOWN FOR HIM

I HOPE YEAH TREAT HER 
WE COULDN'T COME TO TUNBRIDGE WELLS AND NOT TALK ABOUT TUNBRIDGE WARE COULD WE 
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF ITEMS OF TUNBRIDGE WARE IN THIS SALE ALONE 
AND TO TALK ME THROUGH ITS HISTORY WE'VE GOT AUTHOR AND EXPERT BRIAN AUSTEN 
BRIAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING IN 
TELL US EXACTLY WHAT TUNBRIDGE WARE IS 
WELL YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A WIDE ASSORTMENT OF WARES IN FRONT OF ME 
THE COMMON FEATURE IS THEY'RE MADE OF WOOD 
SOME OF THEM ARE TERNARY WARE SOME OF THEM SMALL BOXES AND CABINET WARES 
SO WHERE AND WHEN DID IT ALL START 
WELL IT PROBABLY STARTED IN LONDON 
WE MUST REMEMBER THAT TUNBRIDGE WELLS 
WAS NOT A SETTLEMENT BEFORE THE SPRING WAS DISCOVERED YEAH 
INITIALLY BOXES ARE MADE IN LONDON AND OTHER ITEMS AND I THINK THEY'RE 
BROUGHT DOWN BY LONDON TRADESMAN TO SELL ON THE WALKS TO THE FASHIONABLE VISITORS 
BUT PRODUCTION STARTS IN TUNBRIDGE WELLS PROBABLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
AND HOW DID PRODUCTION TAKE OFF HOW WAS IT CARRIED ON 
IT WAS CARRIED ON IN SMALL WORKSHOPS 
NONE OF THE BUSINESSES WERE EVER LARGE 
WE DO GET SOME IDEA OF THE NUMBER OF WORKMEN WHEN WE GET TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
AND EVEN THE LARGEST WORKSHOPS PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE MORE THAN ABOUT THIRTY AT MOST FORTY WORKMEN 
MANY WERE MUCH SMALLER THAN THAT 
LET'S JUST PICK A FEW OUT STARTING FROM THE EARLIEST 
THROUGH TO THE MIDDLE OF THE PERIOD AND THEN SOMETHING TOWARDS THE END SHALL WE 
LET'S LOOK AT THIS WHITE WOOD SEWING BOX 
THIS IS WHERE IT ALL STARTED YES THAT'S AS EARLY AS WE CAN RECOGNISE 
BEFORE THAT UNDOUBTEDLY THERE WAS TUNBRIDGE WARE 
WE HEAR OF PEOPLE BUYING IT AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS BUT WE JUST CAN'T IDENTIFY IT 
IT ISN'T DISTINGUISHABLE FROM FINE WOOD WARES PRODUCED ELSEWHERE 
DATING PROBABLY FROM ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY TO EIGHTEEN HUNDRED 
DO WE KNOW A MAKER'S NAME ON THIS 
NOT ON THAT ONE BUT WE DO ON THIS NEXT ONE 
YOU'LL SEE THAT THIS IS A VENEERED PIECE 
AND THE CENTRE CARD WHICH IS THE DUTY CARD HAS THE INITIALS J. J. AND A SHARP TUNBRIDGE WELLS 
AND THEY WERE ONE OF THE MAKERS IN THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY 
AND THAT'S A TOP NAME TO LOOK OUT FOR 
YES BUT LABELLED BOXES SHARP BOXES ARE RARE 
ARE THEY YES 
TELL ME ABOUT THE GEOMETRIC PATTERNS AND THE MICRO MOSAIC WORK WHEN WAS THAT INTRODUCED 
THIS BOX SHOWS A VIEW OF BAYHAM ABBEY WHICH IS NEAR TUNBRIDGE WELLS 
PRODUCED WITH THIS MICRO MOSAIC OR TESSELLATED MOSAIC TECHNIQUE 
YOU'VE GOT SOME EXAMPLES OF THE BLOCKS CAN YOU SHOW US HOW IT'S ACTUALLY DONE 
WELL THERE'S A BLOCK 
AND YOU CAN SEE AT THE END THERE IS PART OF A FLOWER HEAD 
THAT'S JUST HALF THE FLOWER 
THAT'S RIGHT AND YOU'D NEED SEVERAL OF THESE BLOCKS 
FOR INSTANCE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR THAT CENTRAL VIEW 
YOU MIGHT FIND THAT YOU'VE GOT AS MANY AS ABOUT TEN OF THESE BLOCKS ALL JOINED TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT VIEW 
O. K. SO ONCE THAT'S BUILT UP TO A CERTAIN LEVEL YOU CAN CUT THROUGH 
ACROSS THE GRAIN AND THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE IMAGE 
YES WHICH YOU THEN STICK ON TO THE VENEER OR TO THE BOX ITSELF 
YOU CAN PUT IT ON TO THE VENEER OR QUITE OFTEN YOU'LL FIND THERE IS A HOLLY SURROUND WHICH THEN HAS TO 
BE CUT AND THE MOSAIC LET INTO THAT FOR THE CENTRE VIEW ON BOXES IT'S INCREDIBLY INTRICATE 
IT IS INDEED YOU MUST HAVE FANTASTIC EYESIGHT AND VERY VERY FINE PRECISE TOOLS AS WELL 
YES IF YOUR SAW WAS THICK YOU WOULD LOSE MOST OF YOUR BLOCK IN SAWDUST WHAT ABOUT RESTORATION 
LET'S SAY YOU'VE GOT A LOVELY BOX A BIT LIKE THIS ONE 
A BAND OF MICRO MOSAIC WORK AND HALF OF IT'S MISSING IN THE MIDDLE WOULD YOU BUY THAT NO 
TOO DIFFICULT TO RESTORE 
THERE ARE A FEW RESTORERS WHO COULD DO IT BUT THE CHARGES WOULD BE EXTREMELY HIGH 
AND IF YOU PUT IT TO A RESTORER WHO WASN'T COMPETENT IT WOULDN'T LOOK RIGHT 
I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU BEFORE YOU GO 
YOU'RE AN EXPERT I'LL PICK YOUR BRAINS WHAT IS YOUR TOP TIP 
WHAT SHOULD WE LOOK OUT FOR IF WE WANT TO BUY A PIECE 
WELL TUNBRIDGE WARE HAS BEEN A GOOD INVESTMENT OVER THE YEARS 
PRICES HAVE NEVER COLLAPSED AS THEY HAVE IN OTHER AREAS 
STEADY MARKET THEN STEADY MARKET 
ONE OF THE MAKERS WHO'S PARTICULARLY POPULAR IS ROBERT RUSSELL 
WHO PRODUCES THIS TUNBRIDGE WELLS MARQUETRY RATHER DIFFERENT FROM THE MOSAIC 
IF YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THE LOBED DESIGNS THEY ARE QUITE INTRICATE 
AND THEY ARE ATTRACTIVE TO COLLECTORS AND FETCH GOOD PRICES DO THEY 
THAT'S THE NAME TO LOOK OUT FOR ONE OF THEM YOU CAN RECOGNISE IT BY THAT PARTICULAR 
INDEED STYLE OF MARQUETRY 
AND ON THAT PARTICULAR BOX WE HAVE A LABEL WOW 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A LOOK YES 
THERE WE ARE THAT'S THE LABEL OF ROBERT RUSSELL 
WHAT WONDERFUL PROVENANCE AND VALUE OF THAT 
YOU WOULDN'T BUY THAT IN AUCTION UNDER FIVE HUNDRED AND IT MIGHT WELL GO MUCH MORE THAN THAT 
O. K. THAT'S THE ONE TO LOOK OUT FOR THANK YOU 
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO RETURN TO THE VALUATION DAY 
CATCH UP WITH OUR TWO EXPERTS CHARLIE AND JAMES AND LET'S SEE WHAT OTHER ITEMS WE CAN FIND 
TO PUT INTO THIS SALE FOR LATER ON IN THE SHOW 
WE'RE STILL VERY BUSY AT THE VALUATION DAY 
AND WHILE I'VE BEEN CHATTING TO PEOPLE IN THE QUEUE 
JAMES HAS FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH SOMEONE HE SAW EARLIER IN THE DAY 
JENNY NATALIE I HAVE TO SAY I SPOTTED YOU IN THE QUEUE WITH THESE ABOUT FOUR HOURS AGO DIDN'T I 
I KNOW THEY'RE NOT WONDERFUL QUALITY BUT IF WE TAKE THE DOMES OFF 
AND JUST PUT THOSE DOWN ON THE FLOOR FOR THE MOMENT 
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT JUST MAKE YOU SMILE 
I THINK THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE THESE TWO AS AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE 
THAT'S WHAT WE SAID WHEN WE SAW THEM 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THEM IN THE FAMILY 
WE BOUGHT THEM IN HARROGATE ABOUT THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO O. K. 
WHEN WE FIRST MARRIED WE HAD A COTTAGE AND THEY SAT LOVELY ON THE FIREPLACE 
WHEN WE SAW THEM WE THOUGHT OH THAT'S US WHEN WE GET THAT AGE 
NODDING FIGURES YOU GENERALLY EXPECT THEM TO BE MADE IN GERMANY MADE IN BISQUE PORCELAIN 
AND THEY ALWAYS HAVE THESE LITTLE WIRE GLASSES 
YOU'D THINK THESE WERE BISQUE PORCELAIN BUT THEY'RE PAPIER MACHE 
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM MORE UNUSUAL 
I WOULD GUESS THESE ARE PROBABLY ENGLISH JUDGING BY THE DRESS AND THE OVERALL LOOK 
THEY HAVE A SORT OF ENGLISH SLASH WELSH QUIRKINESS ABOUT THEM 
THAT I JUST DON'T THINK THE CONTINENTALS WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED QUITE SO MUCH 
THEY'VE BEEN UNDER GLASS DOMES ALMOST ALL THEIR LIVES SO THEY'VE BEEN PROTECTED 
THEY DON'T LOOK AS OLD AS THEY PROBABLY ARE I RECKON THESE ARE GETTING ON FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
AROUND SORT OF NINETEEN HUNDRED TO NINETEEN TEN SOMETHING AROUND THERE THEY'RE FABULOUS 
VERY VERY CRUDELY MADE 
THEY'RE PROBABLY MADE BY SOMEBODY LITERALLY FOR A BIT OF FUN 
THE WOODEN CHAIRS AT THE BACK ARE MADE OUT OF PROBABLY A FRUIT TREE FROM THE BACK GARDEN 
AND THEY'RE HAND PAINTED AND THE BASES ARE JUST A PIECE OF PLAIN TURNED WOOD QUITE CRUDELY CUT OUT 
BUT THEY'RE FUN AREN'T THEY THAT'S RIGHT 
THIS IS PROBABLY PART OF A DOLL'S TEA SERVICE 
THAT'S JUST BEEN GLUED ON HERE AND THE CUSHION HAND STITCHED JUST A BIT OF FUN 
HAVE THEY BEEN OUT TILL THIS WEEKEND NO THEY'VE BEEN IN A CABINET 
AS I SAY WE DON'T USE THEM ANY MORE 
IT WAS MORE THE GLASS I WAS WORRIED ABOUT 
I THOUGHT THAT IS GOING TO GET CHIPPED AND THE KIDS DON'T WANT THEM DECLUTTER 
BOTH CHILDREN AT UNIVERSITY 
SO YOU DON'T WANT THEM WHAT SORT OF THINGS DO YOU LIKE 
I'M A REAL BIG FAN OF OAK FURNITURE AND STUFF 
REALLY EARLY OAK GEORGIAN CHAIRS AND THINGS LIKE THAT CLASSICS 
WONDERFUL AND IT'S A GOOD TIME TO BUY AS WELL YEAH 
OAK FURNITURE HAS NEVER REALLY BEEN AS GOOD VALUE AS IT IS TODAY 
THE FIGURES THEMSELVES I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE A GREAT VALUE 
NO I KNOW THEY'RE JUST A FUN THING 
THEY ARE AND I'M NOT GOING TO PUT A HUGE VALUE ON THEM 
I SUPPOSE SOMEBODY SHOULD PAY SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY TO EIGHTY 
IF IT MAKES THEM SMILE IT'S THE SORT OF THING THEY MIGHT PAY THAT FOR 
AS LONG AS WE'VE GOT SOME PEOPLE THAT LIKE THEM THEY'LL SELL THAT'S RIGHT ALL RIGHT 
HATPINS HATPINS 
BIG COLLECTION OF HATPINS FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN 
YOU'RE JOKING NO 
FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN HATPINS IN THERE YEAH 
DARE I ASK YOU TO OPEN IT FOR A QUICK LOOK WELL I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT VERY GOOD WITH KNOTS 
SHALL I YEAH DO YOU MIND 
IS IT SOMETHING YOU'VE COLLECTED NO THEY WERE MY GRANDMOTHER'S 
OH PEOPLE GASP 
THERE'S ANOTHER BOX OF THEM THERE 
OH MY WORD THAT IS SOME DISPLAY 
TWO BOXFULS YES WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN 
I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THESE ON THE TABLE I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THESE ON THE TABLE 
IT'S ONE OF TWO THINGS YOU'VE GOT HERE GRAHAM 
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS I THINK IT'S EITHER A PICNIC BOX OR A GRAMOPHONE 
I'M GOING TO OPEN IT UP AND HAVE A LOOK 
IT'S A GRAMOPHONE 
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT 
WELL IT WAS MY GRAN'S SHE USED TO PLAY IT WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LAD 
THAT'S QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO NOW 
SURELY NOT 
YES THE FAVOURITE ONE OF HERS WAS DAVY CROCKETT BY MAX BYGRAVES 
DAVY DAVY CROCKETT KING OF THE WILD FRONTIER I REMEMBER IT 
I WAS SICK TO DEATH OF IT 
HAVE YOU STILL GOT THE RECORD 
I'M AFRAID SO I HAVEN'T SMASHED IT YET 
AND YOU INHERITED IT YES 
MY GRAN WAS GETTING ON IN YEARS SO WE HAD TO PUT HER IN A NURSING HOME 
YES BUT SHE'S STILL ALIVE SHE'S NINETY SIX SHE DIDN'T WANT THIS IN THE HOME WITH HER 
NO NOT EVEN DAVY CROCKETT NO 
WOULDN'T HAVE GONE DOWN WELL WOULD IT WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE NURSING HOME NO 
IT'S QUITE GOOD QUALITY 
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE HERE A MAKER'S NAME HAVE YOU ANY IDEA 
NO IDEA WHATSOEVER 
I DON'T THINK IT'S AN H. M. V. BECAUSE I THINK H. M. V. HAD THEIR NAMES 
WOULD'VE HAD IT ON THE PLAYING HEAD AS WELL 
THE ONLY THING I CAN SEE IS THAT THERE'S A BIT OF DISCOLORATION HERE WHERE THERE WAS PROBABLY A LABEL 
PROBABLY COLUMBIA SOMETHING LIKE THAT POSSIBLY 
DATE DO YOU KNOW THE DATE OF IT NO IDEA 
WELL I THINK LOOKING AT THAT I SHOULD THINK IF IT'S NINETEEN FIFTY 
THAT WOULD BE ALMOST EXACTLY RIGHT 
IT'S POST WAR THERE'S A NEEDLE CASE ON THE CORNER THERE 
LITTLE BAKELITE NEEDLE TRAY 
THE WINDER HAS LOST ITS HANDLE I THINK YES 
WOULD HAVE HAD A NICE PROBABLY RED BAKELITE HANDLE TO MATCH THAT I THINK 
THAT'S GOING TO GO IN HERE 
THAT'S IT AND THEN WE'LL WIND IT UP 
THE ALWAYS AMUSING THING IS IT HAD SLOW AND FAST AS WELL 
YOU COULD ALTER THE TEMPO REALLY 
A GOOD RECORD YOU'D ALWAYS KEEP AT THE RIGHT SPEED BUT IF IT'S A HORRIBLE RECORD 
JUST SPEED IT UP AND GET IT OVER WITH 
MAX BYGRAVES 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY WORTH WELL IT IS WORTH THIRTY OR FORTY BECAUSE IT IS IN GOOD CONDITION 
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF RUSTING AROUND THE CATCH BUT THE CHROME HERE IS IN SUPER ORDER 
I WOULD RATHER THINK WE'D LET IT TAKE ITS COURSE REALLY IN THE SALEROOM 
DON'T PUT A RESERVE ON AND LET'S SAY GOODBYE TO IT 
AND WE'LL BE EXCITED ONCE IT GETS ABOVE A TENNER 
IF IT MAKES A TENNER 
OH IT'LL MAKE MORE THAN THAT 
WELL WE'LL SET IT ROLLING AND WE'LL SIT BACK AND LISTEN TO THE DULCET TONES 
ONE TWO THREE O'CLOCK FOUR O'CLOCK ROCK 
FIVE SIX SEVEN O'CLOCK EIGHT O'CLOCK ROCK 
NINE TEN ELEVEN O'CLOCK TWELVE O'CLOCK ROCK 
WE'RE GONNA ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK TONIGHT 
LINDA AT THE BEGINNING OF ANYTHING WE TALK ABOUT ON FLOG IT WE NORMALLY START BY SAYING 
WHOSE WAS IT WHAT'S THE HISTORY ABOUT IT 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD IT 
LET ME GUESS BELONGED TO YOUR PARENTS 
AND FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS IT'S BEEN IN THE CUPBOARD 
YOU DON'T USE IT OR DISPLAY IT AND YOU WANT TO SELL IT 
BECAUSE IT'S OF LITTLE USE EXACTLY RIGHT 
AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH SILVER TODAY 
PEOPLE JUST DO NOT USE IT 
HOW MANY PLACES DO YOU GO TO WHERE YOU HAVE TEA FOR TWO OR AFTERNOON TEA IN THE GARDEN 
USING A SILVER TEA SERVICE IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN 
SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A SOLID SILVER TEA SERVICE 
THE TEAPOT SUGAR BASIN AND MILK JUG ASSAYED IN SHEFFIELD IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
THE COFFEE POT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BIRMINGHAM NINETEEN THIRTY ONE 
AND THE SALVER OR TRAY THAT IT SITS ON SHEFFIELD NINETEEN FORTY SIX 
SO THEY DIDN'T ALL START LIFE TOGETHER 
BUT IT'S IN A PERIOD WHEN TEA DRINKING SOCIALISING 
A GRAND LIFESTYLE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT 
TODAY IT'S MUGS 
MM YEAH AND TEABAGS 
NO SAUCERS AND IT REALLY IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE 
AND THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE SELLING THIS SORT OF THING TODAY 
FOR EVERY TEN OF THESE ON THE MARKET YOU HAVE ONE PERSON LOOKING FOR ONE 
AND THAT'S ALL 
IT SEEMS CRAZY IT DOES 
BUT WHEN I WAS FIRST AN AUCTIONEER I USED TO VALUE THIS SORT OF THING 
TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AT ABOUT TEN AN OUNCE 
IT'S A ROUGH WAY OF DOING IT 
TODAY IT'S BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE AN OUNCE 
GOSH AND THAT'S JUST IN TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS 
SILVER HAS NEVER BEEN CHEAPER 
SMALL WORK SUCH AS VESTA CASES SNUFF BOXES CADDY SPOONS 
THINGS THAT ARE COLLECTIBLE ARE STILL DOING WELL 
BUT THIS SORT OF THING THE MARKET'S FLAT 
SO HAVING DEPRESSED YOU TOTALLY 
AS TO THE VALUE OF THIS LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE BONUSES TO IT AND THE GOOD POINTS IT'S IN GOOD ORDER 
IT HASN'T BEEN OVER POLISHED 
THE SALVER IS WHERE MOST OF THE MONEY WILL BE 
BECAUSE THIS SORT OF THING IS STILL USED 
THE TEA SERVICE IS OUT OF VOGUE PEOPLE DO STILL USE SALVERS 
AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN ENGRAVED NEVER BEEN CHASED 
SO YOU'VE GOT NO INSCRIPTIONS TO POLISH OUT THAT'S ALL IN ITS FAVOUR 
SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL VALUE 
FOR THE TEA SERVICE I WOULD SAY THAT THOSE THREE PIECES ON THEIR OWN ARE WORTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
O. K. THE COFFEE POT IS ANOTHER SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED 
AND THE SALVER IS ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
SO WE'VE GOT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
NOW I THINK THE BEST WAY TO HELP SELL THE TEA SERVICE IS TO PUT IT IN ONE BIG LOT DO YOU 
BUT I THINK PEOPLE WILL FIGHT FOR THE SALVER 
SO IF WE PUT AN ESTIMATE OF THREE HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ON IT TAKE IT TO THE AUCTION 
AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO IS THAT ALL RIGHT THAT'LL BE FINE 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL IT 
WELL FOR THE REASONS YOU'VE SAID IT'S STUCK UP IN THE ATTIC 
I'VE HAD IT FOR TWENTY YEARS AND THAT'S WHERE IT'S STAYED UP THERE 
IT'S NEVER BROUGHT DOWN BECAUSE IT MIGHT GET STOLEN 
WE NEVER USE IT SO I THOUGHT THE BEST THING TO DO IS SELL IT AND ENJOY THE MONEY FINE 
LET'S DO THAT AND SEE HOW WE GO 
CLARE I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY HATPINS 
THERE MUST BE THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED OF THEM 
JUST OVER FOUR HUNDRED 
YOU'VE COUNTED THEM ALL HAVE YOU FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN EXACTLY 
EXACTLY 
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM THEY'RE MY LATE GRANDMOTHER'S COLLECTION 
AND THEY'VE BEEN PASSED DOWN TO MY MOTHER AND THEY'VE BEEN IN HER LOFT 
SINCE MY GRANDMOTHER PASSED AWAY BEEN HIDING IN A LOFT HAVE THEY 
YES YOU'RE IN DANGER OF INHERITING THEM FROM YOUR MOTHER YES I AM 
AND YOU HAVE NO INTENTION TO HOLD ON TO THEM NO NOT REALLY 
THEY DON'T DO A LOT FOR YOU THEY DON'T 
YOU NEED TO PERSUADE YOUR MOTHER TO SELL THEM YES 
WHERE IS SHE AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND 
YES THAT OFTEN HAPPENS AT FLOG IT PEOPLE GO AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND 
AND THEIR CHILDREN TURN UP WITH THEIR THINGS YEAH 
I THINK IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY MIX OF HATPINS 
THERE ARE SOME GOOD ONES THERE ARE SOME DREADFUL ONES THERE ARE SOME MEDIUM ONES 
BUT ALL OF THEM HAVE GOT AN INTEREST AND I PARTICULARLY LIKE SOME OF THE CUSHIONS 
I THINK SOME OF THE CUSHIONS HERE FIRST WORLD WAR ERA CUSHIONS ARE SPLENDID WITH THEIR OWN BEADWORK 
AND I THINK THEY'LL HAVE A VALUE THEMSELVES RIGHT 
WITH REGARD TO VALUING ALL THESE 
WELL WE'LL COME TO IT BUT I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO 
IS JUST SIMPLY TRY AND ISOLATE THE ONES OF INDIVIDUAL MERIT 
AND I'VE PULLED A COUPLE OUT HERE BY CHARLES HORNER 
WHO WE COULD DESCRIBE AS THE DOYENNE OF HATPIN MAKERS 
HIGH ART NOUVEAU 
YOU CAN SEE THE STYLE FABULOUS 
ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED AND THEY'RE SIGNED 
IF YOU LOOK VERY CAREFULLY SIGNED C. H. INTO THE SILVER 
MADE OF SILVER AS OPPOSED TO ALL THESE OTHER BITS AND BOBS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO MAKE THE OTHER ONES 
NOW THESE WOULD HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL VALUE I WOULD HOPE 
OF THIRTY FORTY FIFTY RIGHT 
GEM SET NOT PRECIOUS STONES BUT GEM SET 
WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF THOSE WE'VE GOT FOUR OF THOSE IN FACT 
WE'VE GOT SOME OTHER ONES OF HIS WHICH AREN'T GEM SET YES 
WE THEN LOOKING ROUND HERE HAVE GOT A RARE ECLECTIC MIX 
BUT I THINK THERE ARE ONE OR TWO THAT ONE COULD SAY ARE COLLECTIBLE 
FOR COLLECTORS BECAUSE THEY'RE INTERESTINGLY DIFFERENT 
THERE'S ONE 
IN THE SHAPE OF A GOLF CLUB RIGHT YES 
AND I THINK THAT WAS MADE AS A HATPIN 
IF YOU LOOK AT ONE OR TWO OF THE OTHER ONES I DON'T THINK THEY WERE EVER HATPINS 
THEY'VE GOT HOLD OF SOMETHING STUCK IT ON A BIT OF WIRE AND HELD TOGETHER WITH A BIT OF GLUE 
IT'S AN INTERESTING CONCEPT HOW TO SELL THESE 
DOES ONE SELL THEM INDIVIDUALLY 
PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE THERE'S NO POINT IN PLUGGING THROUGH FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN LOTS 
AT FIFTY P. OR ONE EACH OR WHATEVER 
I THINK THE CHARLES HORNERS NEED TO GO IN PAIRS ONE OR IN PAIRS 
IT'S CERTAINLY INTO HUNDREDS OF POUNDS 
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THERE WAS ONE THOUSAND HERE 
MY VIEW IS FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED IS ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING RIGHT 
DID YOU HAVE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE YOU SET OFF I DID YES THE HIGHER OF YOUR VALUATION REALLY 
THE HIGHER OF THE VALUATION 
I'LL SPEAK TO THE AUCTIONEER AND BETWEEN US WE WILL SORT OUT THE BEST WAY TO SELL THESE 
I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE SOLD AS ONE LOT I'M ADAMANT 
I THINK THEY'LL PROBABLY MAKE SIX OR SEVEN LOTS 
PUT RESERVES ON EACH OF THE LOTS YES 
HOPEFULLY IN AGREEMENT WITH YOUR MOTHER 
AND WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE WILL SHE BE ABLE TO COME TO THE SALE 
SHE MAY BE SHE MIGHT BE BACK IN BLACKPOOL 
I'LL PROBABLY BE REPRESENTING HER 
WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU ON SALE DAY 
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY OF INTEREST 
IMPORTANT FOR US TO TELL THE AUCTIONEERS MAKE SURE THAT THEY NOTIFY THE HATPIN SOCIETY 
RIGHT O. K. 
IN THE HEART OF SUSSEX YOU'RE NEVER FAR AWAY FROM A TRUG 
DON'T WORRY THEY'RE NOT NASTY CREATURES FROM LORD OF THE RINGS 
THEY'RE QUITE CHARMING AND TACTILE AND THEY'VE BEEN FRIENDS 
TO GARDENERS AND FARMERS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
WAY BACK IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTIES A MAN FROM SUSSEX MADE A DECISION 
THAT HAD A PROFOUND EFFECT NOT ONLY ON THE COUNTY BUT ALSO THE REST OF THE WORLD 
HE INVENTED THE SUSSEX TRUG 
AND PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE HAVE USED THE TRUG RIGHT UP TO THE PRESENT DAY 
FOR CARRYING GARDEN TOOLS FRUIT AND VEG FLOWERS AFTER DINNER MINTS AND EVEN WOOL FOR THEIR KNITTING 
AND I'VE JUST DROPPED A STITCH 
AND THIS MAN'S NAME WAS THOMAS SMITH 
TAKING AN ANCIENT IDEA DATING BACK TO ANGLO SAXON TIMES THOMAS REINVENTED THE TROG 
TROGS WERE HEAVY WOODEN CONTAINERS USED BY SUSSEX FARMERS TO MEASURE GRAIN AND LIQUIDS 
BUT THOMAS' REDESIGN WAS AN INSTANT HIT 
HE CREATED A PART OF THE ENGLISH GARDEN SCENE WHICH IS NOW WORLD FAMOUS 
AND KEEPING THOSE TRADITIONS ALIVE IS TRUG MAKER ROBIN TUPPEN 
SO HOW DID THOMAS REDESIGN THE TROG 
BEARING IN MIND THE WORD TROG WAS THE ANGLO SAXON WORD FOR BOAT SHAPE 
SO HE HAD A SOLID FRAME OF CHESTNUT SWEET CHESTNUT 
AND LIGHTWEIGHT BOARDS FILLING THE BASE OF THE TRUG MADE OUT OF WILLOW 
YOU MENTION WILLOW THE WOODS YOU'RE USING ARE THEY LOCALLY GROWN 
WE USE SWEET CHESTNUT WHICH IS COPPICED 
AT THE MOMENT WE'RE COPPICING AT HERSTMONCEUX CASTLE 
THE WILLOW THAT WE USE IS BOUGHT AS A BY PRODUCT OF CRICKET BAT MANUFACTURE 
WE BUY THAT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO PRODUCE THE BLANK BATS 
AND WE USE UP ALL THE WOOD THEY CAN'T USE FOR MAKING CRICKET BATS 
OH RIGHT WHAT ABOUT YOUR MARKET WHO ARE YOU SELLING TO TODAY 
OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING VERY TRADITIONAL 
YOU'RE SELLING TO A MARKET WHO IS VERY CONSUMER CONSCIOUS 
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT BUT WE DO MANAGE 
WE HAVE STIFF COMPETITION FROM COPIES THAT ARE MADE IN CHINA 
YOU COULD SAY THAT COPYING IS A FORM OF FLATTERY 
BUT WE DON'T REALLY SEE IT THAT WAY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS GOOD QUALITY AS OURS 
SO WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR THE TRUG DO YOU SEE ANY NEW DESIGN CONCEPTS COMING IN 
I THINK MAINLY THE FUTURE WILL BE THE SAME AS IT HAS BEEN BUT WE HAVE GOT A NEW IDEA 
IT'S A PICNIC BASKET TRUG BRILLIANT 
IT'S BASICALLY A TRUG WITH A LID ON IT WITH BRASS CATCHES 
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY PERFECT FOR TAKING A PICNIC OUT 
EXACTLY EVERYBODY LOVES A PICNIC YEAH 
CAN I HAVE A GO YOU CERTAINLY CAN 
OOPS 
I THINK I COULD BECOME A TRUG MAKER 
I LIKE THIS I DON'T THINK THAT'S TOO BAD FOR MY FIRST ATTEMPT 
THAT LOOKS QUITE GOOD NICE AND BENDY ISN'T IT NOT BAD AT ALL 
NEXT STAGE RIGHT INTO THE STEAMER HERE WE GO 
WE TAKE THE FRESHLY STEAMED CHESTNUT AND WIND IT CAREFULLY AROUND THE FORMER IT'S LIKE A JIG YEAH 
THIS ONE HE'S MAKING AT THE MOMENT IS A GARDEN TRUG SO IT'S VERY DEEP 
BUT WE ALSO DO SHALLOWER TRUGS FOR SAY CUT FLOWERS 
CRIKEY EVERY DAY YOU COME TO WORK YOU LEAVE THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BEHIND 
HOPEFULLY I WISH I DID 
WHAT HAPPENS NOW NOW WE START TO PUT THE BOARDS IN AND MAKE THE ACTUAL BASKET ITSELF 
SO IT'LL START TO TAKE SHAPE 
THERE YOU GO LOOK AT THAT THERE IS THE FINISHED ITEM 
TELL YOU WHAT IT'S INCREDIBLY STRONG THAT'S GOING TO LAST YEARS AND YEARS 
HOW MANY OF THESE DO YOU MAKE A WEEK 
WELL ONE MAN WILL MAKE AROUND THIRTY FIVE OF THESE IN A WEEK HOW MANY GUYS HAVE YOU GOT WORKING 
WE'VE GOT EIGHT PEOPLE WORKING FOR US MAKING THESE TRUGS 
AND IF YOU WANT THAT THAT'S GOING TO COST YOU ABOUT FIFTY QUID 
FIFTY QUID ON MAIL ORDER 
HAND MADE MAIL ORDER NO EXTRAS 
FIFTY AND THAT WILL LAST YOU AS YOU SAY MANY YEARS 
AND THEY'RE ALL SIGNED THERE ON THE BOTTOM LOOK SO YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT A GENUINE ONE 
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU PAUL 
LET'S REMIND OURSELVES OF WHAT'S GOING TO AUCTION 
JENNY'S NODDING FIGURES SAY YES 
BUT WILL THE BIDDERS SAY NO TO FIFTY TO EIGHTY 
WILL GRAHAM'S GRAMOPHONE COME UP TO SCRATCH AT THIRTY TO FORTY 
LINDA'S SILVER NINETEEN THIRTIES TEA SET 
WILL BE A GOOD BUY IF SHE CAN SAY GOODBYE AT THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED 
AND HANG ON TO YOUR HATS AS CLARE'S COLLECTION OF FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN HATPINS 
HAS BEEN VALUED AT FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED 
NOW WHAT DOES AUCTIONEER DANIEL BRAY MAKE OF THEM 
I REMEMBER THIS FROM THE VALUATION THIS IS THE BEST COLLECTION 
WE'VE EVER HAD ON FLOG IT THAT IS ACTUALLY FOR SALE 
IT BELONGS TO CLARE IT WAS HER GRANDMOTHER'S SHE COLLECTED THEM ALL 
OUR EXPERT HAS PUT FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED ON THE WHOLE COLLECTION WHICH I THINK IS A LITTLE MEAN 
YES WE'VE HAD A LOOK AT THE COLLECTION AND WE'VE SPLIT THEM INTO TEN SEPARATE LOTS 
BECAUSE YOU THINK THEY'LL SELL BETTER THAT WAY I THINK SO INDEED 
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM WILL BE OF MORE INTEREST TO PARTICULAR COLLECTORS AND THE OTHERS MORE DECORATIVE 
AND WE COME TO AN ESTIMATE OF EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND ON THE COLLECTION 
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT AS A TOTAL I WOULD'VE SAID ONE THOUSAND IF NOT MORE MAYBE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED 
THERE'S SOME PARTICULARLY INTERESTING EXAMPLES AMONG THEM 
PARTICULARLY THE SILVER ONES SUCH AS THIS GOLF CLUB HERE BY CHARLES HORNER 
AND WE'RE EXPECTING THERE TO BE A LOT OF INTEREST IN THESE ONES IN PARTICULAR 
AND IS THIS THE SORT OF THING THAT WILL SELL REALLY WELL HERE IN TUNBRIDGE WELLS 
I THINK SO WE FIND WE HAVE LOTS OF COLLECTORS FOR ITEMS SUCH AS THIS 
SEWING RELATED ITEMS AND ITEMS THAT WOULD'VE ADORNED CLOTHING ETC 
I'M REALLY HOPING FINGERS CROSSED THAT THIS COLLECTION REMAINS INTACT 
AND WHOEVER BUYS THEM BUYS THE COMPLETE LOT 
EARLIER IN THE SHOW JENNY AND NATALIE GAVE US THE NOD TO FLOG THIS LOT 
WE'VE GOT TWO NODDING FIGURES IN GLASS DOMES VALUATION FIFTY TO EIGHTY
