WHICH COULD SEE YOUR HOUSE SOLD FOR A TOP PRICE IN JUST ONE SINGLE DAY 
IT'S RADICAL AND IT'S RISKY BUT IF IT ALL WORKS OUT ALL YOUR DREAMS COULD COME TRUE 
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN WELCOME TO OPEN HOUSE 
SO FIRST QUESTION SHOULD BE HOW DOES IT ALL WORK 
WELL WE'LL TAKE ONE DESIRABLE PROPERTY AND STAGE IT VERY CAREFULLY 
FOR A ONE OFF OPEN DAY EVENT TO WHICH WE'LL INVITE THE BEST 
POSSIBLE BUYER AND ASK THEM TO PUT FORWARD THEIR BEST AND FINAL OFFERS BY THE END OF THAT VERY SAME DAY 
WHAT COULD BE SIMPLER I HEAR YOU CRY 
WELL FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO FIND A PROPERTY TO SELL 
AND TODAY I'M IN YORKSHIRE TO HELP A COUPLE SELL THEIR FAMILY HOME 
WHITKIRK IS A QUIET LEAFY SUBURB JUST A TEN MINUTE HOP FROM LEEDS CITY CENTRE 
POPULAR WITH FAMILIES THANKS TO SOME GREAT SCHOOLS AND 
A HIT WITH COMMUTERS BECAUSE OF IT'S DIRECT LINKS TO THE M. ONE 
PROPERTY HERE IS MUCH SOUGHT AFTER AND HAS STEADILY INCREASED IN VALUE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS 
BUT DESPITE THE INCREASE HOUSE HUNTERS ARE STILL QUEUING UP TO BUY HERE 
NOW THE INTRIGUING THING HERE IS THAT THE PROPERTY I'M GOING TO VIEW IS NOT SLAP BANG ON A PUBLIC ROAD 
OH NO IT'S ACTUALLY HIDDEN AWAY DOWN THIS 
RATHER LOVELY PRIVATE ROAD WHICH IS ALWAYS A WINNER WITH BUYERS BECAUSE 
NOT ONLY DOES IT FEEL SECLUDED BUT IN A RATHER POMPOUS MANNER IT DOES MAKE ONE FEEL RATHER GRAND 
IN MY EXPERIENCE OF PROPERTY DEVELOPING I'VE 
LEARNT THAT THOUGH THE SOUTH MIGHT COMMAND THE HIGHEST PRICES THERE'S 
STILL A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE IN THE NORTH OF THE COUNTRY ESPECIALLY ROUND BIG CITIES LIKE LEEDS 
NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE ALWAYS IMPORTANT 
NOW THIS IS ACTUALLY A REALLY LOVELY KITCHEN 
VERY PRACTICAL WELL LAID OUT 
I WOULD SAY THE UNITS ARE ACTUALLY QUITE OLD BUT THEY'VE 
BEEN TAKEN CARE OF VERY WELL LOVED SO IT ALL LOOKS VERY FRESH BUT WHAT 
I REALLY LIKE IS THAT FACT THAT EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT THE WORLD'S LARGEST KITCHEN THEY'VE MADE AN APERTURE 
SHAPE HERE IN THE KITCHEN WALL WHICH LEADS ON TO THE DINING SPACE HERE AND THAT WORKS REALLY WELL 
IT GIVES THE ILLUSION OF SPACE AND IT'S ALSO VERY GOOD I'D IMAGINE FOR SOCIALISING 
I REALLY LIKE THAT FIREPLACE 
AND IF WE'RE TALKING NON FORMAL OFF THE DINING ROOM THERE'S 
A LOVELY CONSERVATORY TO ENJOY A SNEAKY SNACK 
AND NOT ONLY IS THE CONSERVATORY A REALLY GOOD SIZE BUT WILL YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS GARDEN 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY STAGGERING 
IT'S HUGE YOU COULD CHARGE ADMISSION TO THIS 
YOU'VE GOT REALLY MATURE TREES 
IT'S VERY WELL LOOKED AFTER VERY MANICURED 
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE SUMMERHOUSE 
YOU'VE GOT A GREENHOUSE THAT'S SO HUGE IT WOULD MAKE MONTY DON GIGGLE WITH GLEE 
COME AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THIS IS ASTOUNDING 
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE I HAVE NEVER SEEN AT THE END OF SOMEBODY'S GARDEN THEIR VERY OWN PUB 
WE'VE GOT THE PUMPS DOWN HERE SO WE'VE GOT LAGER ALE IT'S GOT ALL THE BEER MATS THE PICTURES 
IT'S EVEN GOT THE BELL 
SECONDS OUT AND ROUND TWO 
BACK INSIDE THE LOUNGE IS ANOTHER IMPRESSIVE SPACE 
ROOMY LIGHT THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DO IN HERE 
AND IF THE UPSTAIRS IS HALF AS GOOD AS THE GROUND FLOOR 
I'M THINKING FAMILIES SHOULD BE FALLING OVER THEMSELVES TO BID ON A PLACE LIKE THIS 
WELL THE BATHROOM'S SMALL AND IT'S NEAT BUT WE MIGHT NEED TO NEUTRALISE A FEW KNICK KNACKS HERE 
AS WELL AS TRYING TO GET A FEEL FOR OUR TARGET BUYER I'M ALSO LOOKING FOR PLACES TO ADD VALUE 
I'VE ALREADY HAD A FEW IDEAS 
THIS BEDROOM FOR INSTANCE IS A GOOD SIZE BUT IT'S CURRENTLY A BIT 
LACKLUSTRE TO REALLY IMPRESS FAMILY BUYERS 
AND WITH GROWING FAMILIES LIKELY TO VIEW THIS SINGLE BEDROOM WOULD BE PERFECT FOR A YOUNG CHILD 
IT'S ALSO GOT A REALLY GOOD SIZED MASTER BEDROOM WITH ACRES OF STORAGE 
SO WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IN TOTAL IS 
A REALLY GOOD HOUSE VERY FAMILY ORIENTATED WITH A MARVELLOUS GARDEN 
SO WHAT I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT NOW IS WHO'S LIVING HERE AND WHY ARE THEY WANTING TO SELL 
CAROL AND JAMES YEOWOOD BOUGHT THE HOUSE TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO 
THEY BROUGHT UP THREE CHILDREN HERE BUT WITH THE KIDS ALL GROWN UP AND 
A GRANDCHILD IN THE PICTURE THEY'RE READY TO MOVE ON 
AND WHEN THEY DO THEY'LL BE LEAVING BEHIND A HIGHLY SALEABLE FAMILY HOME 
BECAUSE THIS ONE IS IN ONE OF THE BEST STREETS IN THE AREA 
NOW JAMES AND CAROL I'VE JUST HAD A NOSE ROUND YOUR PROPERTY 
BUT BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE HOUSE YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS 
A PUB IN THE GARDEN 
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE MAINE I KNEW IT I KNEW IT ALREADY 
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU ACTUALLY LIVED IN THIS HOUSE COS IT FEELS VERY MUCH LIKE A FAMILY HOME 
TWENTY SEVEN YEARS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS 
THAT'S QUITE A LONG TIME ISN'T IT 
M. M. M. WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH IT IT WERE THE GARDEN 
I THINK IT WERE THE GARDEN YEAH THE SPACE YEAH 
SO WHY AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS WHY ARE YOU SELLING IT 
WE WANT TO DOWNSIZE GET A BIT OF EQUITY OUT OF THE HOUSE RIGHT TO ENJOY OURSELVES 
AND SO YOU SHOULD YEAH 
ARE YOU GONNA TRAVEL OR SHARE IT WITH THE FAMILY OR WHAT 
BIT OF EACH BIT OF EACH YEAH BIT OF BOTH YEAH 
BET YOU KNOW HOW TO PARTY A BIT THOUGH AS WELL FOR YOURSELVES DON'T YOU OH YEAH YEAH I BET 
ALL RIGHT DREAM SCENARIO HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD YOU LIKE IT TO SELL FOR 
WE WOULD LIKE ER LIKE TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE YEAH O. K. IT DOESN'T SEEM UNREASONABLE TO ME 
IT'S A GREAT CHUNK OF PROPERTY HUGE GARDEN YEAH WHY NOT EVEN GOT A PUB YEAH 
I'M GONNA HAVE A CHAT WITH THE ESTATE AGENTS DO SOME RESEARCH AND 
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU AND THEN WE'LL MAKE A PLAN IS THAT A DEAL YEAH 
YEAH YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH ANY ALE TILL I GET BACK 
OH PROMISE 
THEY'RE NOT GONNA KEEP THEIR PROMISE ARE THEY YOU CAN'T PROMISE THAT 
RIGHT I'LL SEE YOU LATER ON 
SO CAROL AND JAMES WANT TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND TO REAP THE FRUITS OF THEIR EQUITY AND BEGIN A NEW CHAPTER IN THEIR LIFE 
BEFORE WE START STAGING THEIR HOME I NEED TO FIND OUT IF THEIR AGENT THINKS TWO NINETY FIVE K. IS REALISTIC 
O. K. EMMA I WANT TO TALK TO YOU OBVIOUSLY ABOUT JAMES AND CAROL'S HOUSE YEP IT'S BRILLIANT 
IT'S JUST DOWN A LITTLE TRACK INTO A TINY LITTLE CUL DE S. A. C. 
RIGHT AND THAT'S THE ONLY PROPERTY IN THE CUL DE S. A. C. 
IS IT A DESIRABLE AREA DEFINITELY THE AREA IS REALLY CLOSE TO THE AMENITIES LOADS OF SCHOOLS AS WELL 
REALLY EASY TO GET INTO LEEDS CITY CENTRE 
IS IT GOING TO APPEAL TO A FAMILY MARKET I MEAN IT MUST BE SURELY 
YEAH DEFINITELY COS OF THE REALLY GOOD SIZED BEDROOMS 
ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND AS WELL I THINK IT'LL BE IDEAL TO 
PROBABLY BUILD A GRANNY ANNEXE OR SOMETHING RIGHT SO EXTENDED FAMILY 
SO WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO NOW TO MAKE THIS WORK IS 
COME UP WITH A STRATEGY AND A MARKETING PRICE FOR THE HOUSE 
I THINK OFFERS KIND OF IN THE REGION OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY IS ABOUT RIGHT REALLY 
THEY'RE AFTER AROUND ABOUT THE KIND OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MARK UH HUH 
BE HONEST WITH ME DO YOU THINK THAT'S SLIGHTLY AMBITIOUS OR IS IT ACHIEVABLE 
I THINK IT IS ACHIEVABLE HOPEFULLY BUT YOU NEVER KNOW REALLY ON THE DAY I'M FEELING FAIRLY CONFIDENT 
I THINK YOU KNOW ON THE OPEN DAY I WILL TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT HOUSE LOOKS AMAZING 
WHAT I'M ASKING OF YOU IS THAT YOU GET IN LITERALLY AT THE DOOR A QUEUE OF REALLY HUNGRY POTENTIAL BUYERS 
O. K. CAN YOU DO THAT COURSE WE CAN 
FANTASTIC WE HAVE A BATTLE PLAN 
I WILL SEE YOU ON THE OPEN DAY ALL RIGHT THEN ALL RIGHT TAKE CARE TAKE CARE BYE 
SO GETTING THE YEOWOODS THEIR DREAM PRICE COULD BE SOMEWHAT AMBITIOUS 
NOW BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER I'M GONNA CHECK OUT THE LOCAL 
MARKET TO FIND OUT WHAT IS ON OFFER FOR POTENTIAL BUYERS 
WELL AT THE LOWER END OF THE MARKET THIS TWO BED NINETEENTH CENTURY 
LISTED BUILDING BLENDS PERIOD FEATURES LIKE EXPOSED 
BRICKWORK WITH MODERN TOUCHES LIKE A SMART CONTEMPORARY KITCHEN 
THE OLD MEETS NEW STYLING CONTINUES UPSTAIRS WHERE PERIOD FEATURES LEAD THE WAY TO A MODERN MASTER BEDROOM 
THE BATHROOM COULD DO WITH UPDATING BUT AT JUST UNDER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THIS PLACE 
HAS BAGS OF CHARACTER FOR FIRST TIME BUYERS 
CLIMBING TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE MARKET THIS SIZEABLE SEMI HAS BAGS 
OF COUNTRY CHARACTER FROM A KITCHEN DINER WITH COOKING RANGE 
TO A GOOD SIZED LIVING ROOM WITH CLASSIC STYLING 
UPSTAIRS THINGS ARE MORE CONTEMPORARY WITH A CORNER BATH AND THREE DOUBLE BEDROOMS 
ONE OF WHICH THE ATTIC ROOM BOASTS GREAT VIEWS OF THE SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE 
AND SOME OF THAT GREENERY IS RIPE FOR DEVELOPMENT 
THIS PLACE COMES WITH LAND AND PLANNING PERMISSION WORTH ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
ALL THAT FOR THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
THE YEOWOODS' PLACE IS IN DIRECT COMPETITION WITH THIS DETACHED FAMILY HOME 
ROOMY LIVING ROOM CHECK 
WALK THROUGH FAMILY DINING AREA CHECK 
FUNCTIONAL FAMILY KITCHEN MAYBE A LITTLE TOO MUCH CHECK 
THE BATHROOM BOASTS A VICTORIAN STYLE ROLL TOP BATH 
AND THE THREE DOUBLE BEDROOMS ARE ALL OF A REASONABLE SIZE 
THE OUTDOOR SPACE CAN'T COMPETE WITH OUR PROPERTY AND THERE'S NO SIGN OF A PUB AT THE END OF THE GARDEN 
THE PRICE JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND 
SO THERE'S SOME TOUGH COMPETITION BUT I THINK WITH THE RIGHT STAGING 
THE YEOWOODS' PLACE COULD REALLY STAND OUT AND I THINK WE CAN PITCH IT AT AROUND TWO NINETY K. 
CAROL AND JAMES YEOWOOD WANT TO SELL THEIR HOME TO MOVE NEARER TO THEIR GRANDCHILD 
THEIR AGENT'S MARKETING THE PLACE AT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TO GET BUYERS THROUGH THE DOOR 
BUT THEY'RE PINNING THEIR HOPES ON A DREAM PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
SO COULD WE WITH SOME CLEVER STAGING GET THEM A TOP PRICE 
NOW JAMES AND CAROL WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS OPEN DAY AS YOU KNOW AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT 
SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO FORMULATE A PLAN 
NOW MOST OF THE HOUSE IS BRILLIANT 
BUT I THINK THERE'S ONE OR TWO THINGS THAT BUYERS WILL PROBABLY WANT TO CHANGE 
O. K. THE KITCHEN YEAH DO YOU THINK THAT'S FAIR YEAH DEFINITELY 
YOU DON'T WANNA PUT IN A NEW KITCHEN DO YOU NO 
NO SO WE NEED TO JUST THINK OF A WAY TO GIVE IT 
A BIT OF A NIP AND TUCK AND MAKE IT FEEL FRESHER YEAH 
WHAT WE'RE ALSO GONNA DO IS SET DRESS THIS HOUSE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM 
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT LOOK FAULTLESS 
WE NEED TO STAGE THIS HOUSE AS THE PERFECT PROPERTY FOR FAMILIES 
AND THEY NEED SPACE I THINK THE FURNITURE IN THE CLUTTERED 
ILL THOUGHT OUT SECOND BEDROOM NEEDS REORGANISING TO REALLY SHOW OFF THE ROOM'S POTENTIAL 
NOW THE MASTER BEDROOM IS BETTER LAID OUT BUT IT'S DULL DULL DULL DULL DULL 
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND A FORTUNE SO I NEED CHEAP SIMPLE TRICKS TO GIVE IT STYLE AND A UNIFIED COLOUR SCHEME 
AND THE OTHER THING WE NEED TO DO IS THIS HOUSE HAS GOT ONE BRILLIANT ASSET AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS 
THE GARDEN YEAH 
NO IT'S GOT YOU 
OH O. K. COS YOU ARE SO LOVELY AND SUCH WARM PEOPLE AND SO HOSPITABLE THAT WE NEED TO UTILISE THAT 
SO YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE PEOPLE FEEL REALLY RELAXED AND WELCOME M. M. M. 
GET THEM OUT THERE GET THEM IN YOUR PUB 
YEAH AND LET'S GET PEOPLE LAUGHING AND WE'LL SUCCEED 
ALL RIGHT LOVELY SO WITH AN OPEN DAY ON THE HORIZON THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE 
THE TRANSFORMATION KICKS OFF WITH A VENGEANCE 
AND IT'S ALL HANDS TO THE PUMPS 
FAMILIES WANT TO IMAGINE THEIR LIVES AND BELONGINGS IN YOUR HOUSE SO IT'S ESSENTIAL TO CLEAR YOUR JUNK 
WE'RE ALSO MOVING THE BADLY ORGANISED FURNITURE 
AND WHIPPING OFF THE DOORS TO THE KITCHEN UNITS IN PREPARATION FOR A LICK OF PAINT 
CHEERS 
THE ONE THING THAT HOUSE HAS TO OFFER OVER IT'S COMPETITORS 
BESIDES THE BAR IS THAT REALLY GREAT SIZED GARDEN 
WHICH IS RIPE FOR AN EXTENSION 
WHICH WILL GIVE EXPANDING FAMILIES ROOM TO GROW 
THERE ARE VARIOUS OPTIONS FOR UTILISING OUTDOOR SPACE 
FROM UPMARKET GARDEN ROOMS LIKE THIS WHICH CAN ADD A HOME OFFICE SECOND LIVING SPACE OR EXTRA BEDROOM 
TO A SERIOUS TWO STOREY EXTENSION LIKE THIS ONE 
WHICH FREED UP SPACE FOR IT'S OWNERS TO ADD A LARGE KITCHEN DINER AND EXTRA BEDROOMS 
I THINK AN EXTENSION COULD ADD BIG MONEY TO THE VALUE OF THE YEOWOODS' PROPERTY 
AND CAROL CUNNINGHAM AT THE LOCAL PLANNING OFFICE AGREES 
SO WE'VE ARRANGED FOR HER TO PAY JAMES AND CAROL A VISIT 
YOU'VE GOT THE LAND TO EXTEND HERE SO IT IS A GOOD DEVELOPMENT PROSPECT FOR ANYONE WHO'S BUYING IT REALLY 
YEAH THE PROPERTY HAS POTENTIAL TO PUT A TWO STOREY EXTENSION ON THIS SIDE 
YOU COULD MOVE YOUR CONSERVATORY 
PUT THE TWO STOREY ON AND BRING YOUR CONSERVATORY FURTHER ROUND 
LOCAL AGENTS ESTIMATE THAT A TWO STOREY EXTENSION COULD ADD AS MUCH AS A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
TO THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY BUT I'M NOT SUGGESTING DOING THAT IN TIME FOR OUR OPEN DAY OH NO 
I JUST WANT BUYERS TO BE AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL TO EXTEND 
AND OUR EXPERT HAS AGREED TO ATTEND THE OPEN DAY TO SPARK THEIR IMAGINATIONS 
AND WITH OUR BIG OPEN DAY FAST APPROACHING THE HOUSE TRANSFORMATION IS WELL UNDERWAY 
THE DULL KITCHEN UNITS ARE SLOWLY BEING DRAGGED INTO THE LIGHT THANKS TO THE MAGIC OF WHITE PAINT 
AND FOR OUR NEXT TRICK 
WE'LL CREATE AN ILLUSION OF SPACE BY REWORKING THE LAYOUT IN THE SECOND BEDROOM 
O. K. PICTURE THE SCENE IT'S THE OPEN DAY 
YOUR HOUSE IS BUSTLING FULL OF POTENTIAL BUYERS 
THE CHAMPAGNE IS FLOWING AND YOUR DOORBELL WILL NOT STOP RINGING 
IT CAN BE TRICKY FINDING TIME 
TO TELL EVERY BUYER ABOUT YOUR HOUSE AND THE SURROUNDING AREA 
AND THIS IS WHERE THE PROPERTY PROFILE PACK COMES IN 
THE PROFILE PACK SHOULD HELP ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS BUYERS MIGHT HAVE 
AS THIS HOUSE IS IN THE CATCHMENT AREA FOR SEVERAL GOOD SCHOOLS 
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR BUYERS TO HAVE ALL THOSE DETAILS 
ALSO INCLUDE PHOTOGRAPHS OF ALL THE ROOMS AND GARDEN 
AND NORMALLY I'D INCLUDE PLANS FOR A POSSIBLE EXTENSION BUT WE'VE GONE ONE BETTER 
WE'VE GOT OUR EXPERT JOINING US ON THE DAY 
WE'VE NOT GOT LONG TO STAGE THE YEOWOODS' HOUSE FOR A ONE OFF OPEN VIEWING 
THEY WANT TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND TO DOWNSIZE AND MOVE CLOSER TO THEIR GRANDCHILD 
SO WE'RE HOPING TO BEAT THE MARKETING PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND BUT COULD IT BE A DREAM TOO FAR 
TO STAND ANY CHANCE THE PROPERTY MUST BE PERFECT 
AND THAT MEANS RIGHT DOWN TO THE TINIEST TOUCHES 
A SIMPLE WAY TO SPRUCE UP YOUR KITCHEN IS TO POLISH THE HANDLES WITH BRASS CLEANER 
OR IF YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY AND BE GREEN IN THE PROCESS A TOP TIP IS TO MIX LEMON JUICE WITH COARSE SALT 
AND ELBOW GREASE TO TURN THAT MUCK INTO BRASS 
THEY SAY YOU GET SEVEN YEARS BAD LUCK FOR A BROKEN MIRROR 
BUT A DIRTY ONE CAN BRING ONE DAY'S BAD VIEWINGS 
MIRRORED WARDROBES LIKE JAMES' AND CAROL'S SHOULD BE POLISHED UNTIL THEY SHINE LIKE 
WELL LIKE MIRRORS REALLY NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF GREENERY AND FOLIAGE IN YOUR 
BATHROOMS AND KITCHENS BECAUSE PSYCHOLOGICALLY THEY MAKE SPACES FEEL FRESH CLEAN AND HYGIENIC 
SO ONE FOR THE KITCHEN AND ONE FOR THE BATHROOM 
PROPERTY ON THIS STREET IS IN BIG DEMAND AND WHEN IT DOES COME ON THE MARKET 
IT'S A MASSIVE DRAW FOR FAMILIES 
AND WITH A LAST MINUTE SWEEP UP THE YEOWOODS' HOUSE IS FINALLY STAGED TO WOW THOSE FAMILY BUYERS 
THE SECOND BEDROOM WAS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF WASTED SPACE BUT WE'VE 
CLEARED THE CLUTTER AND REARRANGED THE FURNITURE TO CREATE THE KIND OF GENUINE DOUBLE BEDROOM BUYERS CRAVE 
WITH IT'S TIRED CUSHIONS AND DUVET THE MASTER LACKED THE WOW FACTOR OF A WELL STAGED BEDROOM 
NOW CRISP FRESH LINEN STYLISH CUSHIONS AND A CONSISTENT 
RED WHITE COLOUR SCHEME SHOULD HAVE BUYERS REACHING FOR THEIR CHEQUE BOOKS 
BUT THE BIGGEST CHANGE IS IN THE KITCHEN 
THIS WAS A DARK AND UNINSPIRING SPACE BUT WHAT A TRANSFORMATION 
WITH A LICK OF WHITE PAINT AND SOME STYLISH COOKING UTENSILS 
IT'S NOW A MODERN FAMILY KITCHEN TO DAZZLE POTENTIAL BUYERS 
IN SHORT WE'VE TAKEN AN UNDISTINGUISHED FAMILY HOME 
AND TRANSFORMED IT INTO A MODERN STYLISH HOT PROPERTY FAMILY BUYERS WON'T BE ABLE TO RESIST 
IT WAS AN INEXPENSIVE TRANSFORMATION AND WE FINISHED IT IN THE NICK OF TIME 
IT'S THE BIG DAY FOR THE YEOWOODS WHEN THEY OPEN THEIR DOORS 
TO POTENTIAL BUYERS AND INVITE BIDS TO SELL THEIR PROPERTY 
THEY WANT TO RAISE TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
BUT THEIR AGENT THINKS TWO EIGHTY K. COULD BE MORE REALISTIC 
I HOPE WE'LL BEAT THAT BUT TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND MAY BE A TAD AMBITIOUS 
BUT TO STAND ANY CHANCE THOUGH WE NEED A HOUSE FULL OF BUYERS 
SO EMMA WHAT'S THE RESPONSE BEEN TO THE IDEA OF THE OPEN DAY 
WE'VE HAD QUITE A LOT OF POSITIVE PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE YEAH 
THEY'VE SAID THEY'RE GONNA COME DOWN AND HAVE A GOOD LOOK O. K. SO IT'S BEEN O. K. 
NOT LIKE HUGE AMOUNTS BUT ENOUGH ENOUGH HOPEFULLY 
ENOUGH THAT'S WHAT I WANNA HEAR 
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK ARE GONNA TURN UP TODAY 
WELL WE HAD TEN DEFINITE YES ES BUT I THINK THAT'S KIND OF DOWN TO ABOUT FIVE NOW 
OOH DO WE THINK THEY'RE QUITE SERIOUS PEOPLE 
THEY ARE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT COMING TO HAVE A LOOK 
I THINK A GOOD PLAN OF ATTACK WOULD BE FOR YOU TO STAND OUTSIDE 
YOU SMILE AND GREET PEOPLE THROW THEM IN THE HOUSE AND WE'LL TAKE OVER FROM THERE 
YEAH O. K. SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN COME ON LET'S DO IT O. K. 
THERE'S AN AUDIENCE OF POTENTIAL BUYERS ON THEIR WAY AND THE HOUSE IS READY TO TAKE CENTRE STAGE 
OUR KEY PLAYERS NEED TO BE PREPPED FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF A LIFETIME 
SO JAMES AND CAROL WHAT A MAGNIFICENT TRANSFORMATION ON YOUR HOUSE 
IT'S GREAT ARE YOU PLEASED YEAH IT'S LOVELY YES VERY PLEASED YEAH 
PLEASED WITH THE KITCHEN AND THE BEDROOMS LOOK GREAT AS WELL 
AND YOUR GARDEN ALWAYS LOOKS LOVELY 
BUT I LIKE THE FACT YOUR PUB'S BEEN UPGRADED TO A CHAMPAGNE BAR FOR THE DAY 
OH YEAH I LIKE IT YEAH NOW LET'S FOCUS ON THE REALITY OF THE 
FACT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO THE OPEN DAY DO WE HAVE ANY LAST MINUTE NERVES 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT STRANGE BUT IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IT ALL IN ONE DAY THAN LIKE PROLONGING THE AGONY 
YEAH ALL I WOULD SAY IS THAT I KNOW THE HOUSE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT 
BUT ON THIS OPEN DAY I THINK YOU ARE REALLY KEY TO SELLING THIS HOUSE 
YOU'RE LOVELY YOU'RE ADORABLE AND JUST USE YOUR NATURAL CHARM 
AND YOUR WARMTH AND I THINK WE'LL WIN EVERYBODY OVER 
SO HERE'S TO YOU AND HERE'S TO YOUR HOUSE YEAH GOOD LUCK CHEERS CHEERS OPEN HOUSE 
AND WE'RE OFF 
WE'VE GOT JUST A FEW HOURS TO WOO OUR BUYERS INTO MAKING A BID WHICH DOES NOTHING TO SETTLE THE NERVES 
WHO'S NERVOUS PUT YOUR HAND UP GETTING A BIT APPREHENSIVE NOW 
BRAVE FACES RIGHT DOORBELL'S ABOUT TO GO 
YEAH OOH DON'T LET THAT DOORBELL GO 
THIS IS MORE LIKE IT 
I'M KRISTIAN LOVELY TO MEET YOU ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
HELLO HELLO COME ON IN COME ON IN 
THIS IS CAROL AND JAMES THEY OWN THE HOUSE HELLO 
I'LL LEAVE YOU IN THEIR HANDS ANY PROBLEMS GIVE ANYONE A SHOUT RIGHT ALL RIGHT 
RIGHT IT'S OVER TO YOU THIS IS A ROOM 
NICE FIREPLACE THIS IS A ROOM GENIUS 
WHILE JAMES POLISHES UP HIS SALES TECHNIQUE I NEED TO INTERCEPT ANOTHER IMPORTANT VISITOR 
OUR EXPERT FROM THE COUNCIL PLANNING OFFICE HELLO CAROL HOW ARE YOU 
I'M FINE I'M KRISTIAN LOVELY TO MEET YOU 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING TO DO THIS 
IT'S O. K. WHEN PEOPLE ARE VIEWING THE PROPERTY WHAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IS IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN 
TO THEM WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T POSSIBLY DO 
YES THAT'S FINE YES I'M SURE YOU KNOW IT ALL ALREADY ANYWAY 
O. K. AND THERE'S A CHAMPAGNE BAR ROUND THERE SO HELP YOURSELF 
THANKS A LOT ALL RIGHT EXCELLENT 
EVEN THOUGH THINGS ARE GOING WELL 
CHAMPAGNE CAN MAKE THEM EVEN BETTER 
IT'S THE PERFECT WAY TO CREATE A CONVIVIAL ATMOSPHERE AND TO RELAX POTENTIAL BUYERS 
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO OPEN THAT CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE FOLLOWED BY THAT CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE O. K. 
FIRST ONE TO OPEN IT WINS A PRIZE WAHEY O. I. LOOK AT THAT MARVELLOUS 
AND THINGS ARE REALLY HOTTING UP WITH MORE BUYERS ARRIVING ALL THE TIME THIS IS JAMES HE LIVES HERE 
YEAH PLEASED TO MEET YOU 
AND I'M KEEN TO CLARIFY EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT FROM THE PROPERTY 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR EITHER A THREE BEDROOM BUT LARGER THREE BEDROOM 
YEAH WITH MAYBE ROOM TO EXTEND OR A FOUR BEDROOM 
I THINK WE'VE HOOKED AN INTERESTED PARTY HERE 
I'M JUST NOT SURE JAMES IS UP TO THE TASK OF REELING THEM IN 
FIRST TIME I'VE EVER DONE THIS 
HE'S A MAN OF VERY FEW WORDS WHEN IT COMES TO SELLING A KITCHEN I DON'T THINK 
IT'S HIS FORTE IN LIFE SO I FEEL I MAY NOW GO IN THERE AND TAKE OVER 
THIS IS THE CONSERVATORY THING 
MY CUNNING PLAN IS IS LET JAMES FINISH WITH THEM DOWNSTAIRS AND I'LL 
TAKE OVER AND SHOW THEM UPSTAIRS AND THE GARDEN I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR 
BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE BECAUSE I'VE GOT ANOTHER INTERESTED PARTY TO DEAL WITH FIRST 
SO THEY SAID THEY'D GIVE PLANNING PERMISSION ON THE SIDE THEN 
ON THIS SIDE HERE ON THIS SIDE GREAT BIG TWO STOREY EXTENSION 
OR YOU COULD DO A SINGLE STOREY EXTENSION AT THE BACK TO MAKE THE KITCHEN AND DINING ROOM BIGGER 
THINGS ARE GETTING REALLY BUSY AND CAROL IS DOING HER BEST TO HOLD THE FORT DOWNSTAIRS 
THIS IS DINING ROOM ANYWAY 
YOU CAN GET SIX CHAIRS ROUND THERE ERM 
AND I FINALLY PICKED UP THE BATON FROM JAMES AND GOT OUR MOST INTERESTED BUYERS UPSTAIRS 
LOTS OF SPACE IN HERE AND YOU'VE GOT A HUGE TRIPLE WARDROBE LOVELY VIEWS ACROSS THE GARDEN 
YES IT'S QUITE NICE ISN'T IT IT IS 
I QUITE LIKE THAT IT'S A LOVELY GARDEN 
AND HERE IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
AGAIN BIG SPACIOUS LIGHT YES THEN THE THIRD BEDROOM IS THERE 
GO AND HAVE A LOOK IS IT TOO BIG OR TOO SMALL 
IT'LL PROBABLY BE WHAT WE WOULD USE AS A STUDY 
AT THE MOMENT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE'RE A BEDROOM TOO SHORT FOR YOU 
MM HMM BUT YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE WILLING TO EXTEND YES 
THEN I HAVE A VERY VERY IMPORTANT LADY YOU SHOULD MEET THIS WAY O. K. 
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO PLAN AND INVITING OUT COUNCIL EXPERT TO THE OPEN HOUSE WAS A MASTER STROKE 
THIS COUPLE HERE WOULD 
REALLY WANT TO EXTEND BECAUSE ONE OF THE BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS IS TOO SMALL 
O. K. SO IF YOU COULD JUST EXPLAIN IN TERMS OF PLANNING WHAT THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO 
O. K. I MEAN WHAT WE WOULD LOOK FOR THINKING TO BE ACCEPTABLE IS THERE'D BE THE POTENTIAL TO PUT A TWO STOREY 
SIDE EXTENSION ON HERE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE BEDROOMS TO BE INCREASED IN SIZE OR PUT AN EXTRA BEDROOM ON 
OUR COUNCIL EXPERT IS DOING A GREAT JOB AND EVEN JAMES HAS REVEALED HIDDEN TALENTS FOR SELLING ONE 
SPECIFIC PART OF HIS HOUSE I THINK IT'S QUITE GOOD THIS 
IT'S HANDY WHEN YOU'RE CUTTING GRASS COS YOU CAN STOP IN HERE FOR 
HALF TIME AND CARRY ON AGAIN 
WHY DID I PUT JAMES IN CHARGE OF SHOWING PEOPLE 
AROUND THE HOUSE WHEN HE SHOULD'VE BEEN SHOWING THEM ROUND HIS BELOVED PUB 
HE COULD SELL THAT TILL THE COWS COME HOME 
FORGET COWS ALL OUR CHICKENS ARE COMING HOME TO ROOST 
WE'VE GOT SOME SERIOUS INTEREST THEY'RE GOING BACK IN NOW FOR A FOURTH TIME 
I THINK THAT MEANS THEY MUST BE QUITE SERIOUS YEAH 
BUT WE'RE NOT RESTING ON OUR LAURELS 
THERE'S PLENTY TO DO BACK IN THE HOUSE 
AND THIS IS THE CONSERVATORY 
IT'S VERY BRIGHT IN HERE TODAY ISN'T IT 
YES IT IS HEY LISTEN LET ME GIVE YOU THESE PROPERTY PROFILE PACKS 
IT TELLS YOU ALL ABOUT THE HOUSE ALL ABOUT THE AREA O. K. 
THANK YOU ANYTHING YOU NEED TO ASK IT'S THERE 
INTERESTED PARTIES ARE PORING OVER THE PROPERTY PROFILE PACKS 
THERE ARE POTENTIAL BUYERS ALL OVER THE HOUSE AND A REAL 
PARTY ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS EXACTLY AS I PLANNED HAVING A NICE TIME 
YEAH GOOD HAVING A LOVELY TIME 
YES THANK YOU THANK YOU PERFECT 
AND WE'VE STRUCK THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN SALES AND SOCIALISING 
NOW I KNOW IT'S NOT HEALTHY BEING A VOYEUR BUT THOSE 
POTENTIAL BUYERS THERE I THINK ARE REALLY REALLY INTERESTED 
THEY'VE HUNTED EMMA DOWN AND THEY'VE BEEN TALKING 
WITH HER FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES NOW WHICH IS A VERY VERY GOOD SIGN 
IT'S BEEN A BUSY OPEN HOUSE 
AND AS OUR LAST FEW BUYERS DRIFT AWAY ARMED WITH OUR PROPERTY PROFILE PACKS TIME'S UP 
WELL OUR OPEN HOUSE IS NOW OFFICIALLY CLOSED AND OUR OPEN DAY IS OVER 
ALL THOSE POTENTIAL BIDDERS HAVE GONE OFF TO DECIDE IF THEY'RE GOING TO PLACE A BID 
AND THEY HAVE JUST THREE HOURS TO MAKE UP THEIR MIND 
AND ALL WE CAN DO IN THE MEANTIME IS JUST SIT AND WAIT 
IT'S GOING TO BE A STRESSFUL COUPLE OF HOURS 
AS ALL THE BIDS MUST GO THROUGH THE ESTATE AGENT THEY WON'T KNOW ANYTHING UNTIL AFTER THE DEADLINE 
HOW DO WE HONESTLY FEEL 
DO YOU FEEL THAT ANYBODY'S GONNA PUT ANY BIDS IN OR NOT BE HONEST 
WE HOPE SO WE HOPE SO BUT IF 
WILL HAVE TO DO I DON'T KNOW 
WHILE WE WAIT AND WORRY POTENTIAL BUYERS ARE MAKING UP THEIR MINDS ABOUT THE PROPERTY 
UM REALLY REALLY NICE 
THE HOUSE ITSELF IS REALLY BRIGHT AND AIRY 
THE GARDEN DID IT FOR ME 
I KNOW THE HOUSE HAS GOT A LOT OF POTENTIAL BUT I LIKE THE GARDEN 
IT WAS MARKETED AT TWO EIGHTY K. TO GET BUYERS INTERESTED 
I HOPE THAT WE CAN BEAT THAT BUT AS TIME MARCHES ON ONLY TIME WILL TELL 
I FEEL WE'RE IN A POSITION TO BID IF WE WANTED TO GO AHEAD YEAH 
I JUST FEEL THAT I CAN'T MAKE A SNAP DECISION 
IT'S JUST SORT OF TOO RISKY FOR US TO PUT THAT BID IN TO NOT SORT OF KNOW 
YEAH IT'S FIRST TIME WE'VE DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS SO I'D RATHER GO HOME AND SLEEP ON IT YEAH 
BIDS HAVE TO BE IN WITHIN THE NEXT TEN MINUTES 
AFTER THAT IT'S TOO LATE WONDER HOW MANY BIDS WE'VE GOT I DON'T KNOW AND IF IT'S RIGHT PRICE YOU KNOW 
WELL WE DON'T DO WE NO FIND OUT SOON WON'T WE WE WILL 
AND WITH THE DEADLINE FINALLY UPON US CAN EMMA TELL US IF WE'VE HAD ANY GOOD BIDS 
I TELL YOU WHAT THAT IS EMMA PULLING UP SO I'M GONNA HAVE A QUICK 
WORD WITH HER FIND OUT WHAT THE SCENARIO IS AND THEN GET STRAIGHT BACK TO YOU IS THAT ALL RIGHT 
YEAH LOVELY LOVELY YEAH 
EMMA THERE'S A V. I. P. IF EVER I SAW ONE 
RIGHT O. K. HELLO HOW DID IT ALL GO 
BE VERY HONEST WITH ME WHAT'S THE RESPONSE BEEN LIKE 
IT WAS O. K. GOT AN OFFER WHICH IS REALLY GOOD 
WELL THAT'S GREAT I WILL GIVE THAT TO JAMES AND CAROL AND SEE HOW THEY RESPOND TO IT 
BRILLIANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK YOU'VE BEEN VERY DILIGENT BYE 
EMMA THOUGHT WE'D GET TWO EIGHTY K. LET'S HOPE THE FIGURE IN THE ENVELOPE BEATS THAT 
RIGHT CAROL AND JAMES 
O. K. THIS IS THE SITUATION YEAH 
THE OPEN DAY HAS ENCOURAGED LOTS AND LOTS OF POSITIVE FEEDBACK 
WHAT I'VE GOT IN MY HAND IS THE TOP BID SO WE'LL SEE WHAT WE ACHIEVED 
YEAH YEAH FINE 
ANYTHING OVER TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY WOULD BE GOOD WOULDN'T IT YEAH IT WOULD YEAH 
O. K. 
THE HIGHEST BID IS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND 
OH SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT FINE REALLY YEAH 
IF WE DO TAKE THE OFFER AND WE'VE GOT THE MONEY IN THE BANK AND 
WE RENT SOMEWHERE WE'VE GOT A GOOD CHANCE OF BUYING SOMEWHERE ELSE 
BUYING SUMMAT AND BARGAINING YES 
SO WE MIGHT GET OURS A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THAT I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU OH THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IT'S A GREAT RESULT 
THE TARGET WAS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY GRAND BUT WE BEAT THAT BY FOUR THOUSAND 
NOW IT'S DOWN THE VENDOR AND THEIR ESTATE AGENT TO CLINCH THE SALE 
WELL AT THE END OF THE DAY WE RECEIVED A VERY RESPECTABLE BID 
BUT DO YOU KNOW THE CURIOUS THING IS WE WILL NEVER KNOW 
WHO MADE THE BID BECAUSE THEY WANT TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS THEREFORE THEY ARE OUR MYSTERY BIDDER 
THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE FOR JAMES AND CAROL HAS BEEN RATHER NERVE WRACKING 
BUT I WOULD SAY IT'S PAID DIVIDENDS CAN WE DO IT ALL AGAIN 
WELL THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT AND THAT'S BY JOINING ME NEXT TIME ON OPEN HOUSE
