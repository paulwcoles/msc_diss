AFTERNOON FOLKS WELCOME TO THE 
DAILY POLITICS AS M. P.'S RETURN TO 
WESTMINSTER GORDON BROWN'S FACING 
TROUBLE ON ALL FRONTS IN HIS OWN 
PARTY BACKBENCH REBELS ARE 
THREATENING TO VOTE AGAINST CHANGES 
TO THE TAX SYSTEM TONIGHT THE 
PRIME MINISTER MEETS HIS CRITICS 
FACE TO FACE IN A LAST DITCH CALL 
FOR UNITY WE LOCK AT THE ISSUE 
THAT'S SPLIT AFTER JOHN PRESCOTT REVEALS 
THAT HE BINGED ON FOOD TO COPE WITH 
STRESS WE WILL TALK TO A CLOSE 
FRIEND OF THE FORMER DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER ABOUT LIFE IN HIGH OFFICE 
WE ARE BACK ALL THAT IN THE NEXT 
HALF HOUR L. AM BACK WITH THE FLU 
JENNY IS BACK WITH HER P. FORTY FIVE SHE IS 
LEAVING US VIEWERS 
NOT FOR A 
WHILE YET 
LEAVING US FOR THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND 
I HAVE A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS LEFT 
THEN WE WILL HAVE FUN 
WITH US FOR THE NEXT THIRTY MINUTES IS 
THE CONSERVATIVE FRONTBENCHER 
SHADOW LEADER OF THE COMMONS 
THERESA MAY WELCOME BACK YOU ARE 
NOT GOING ANY WHERE NOT NOT IMMEDIATELY NO 
AH A STORY LET'S 
KICK OFF WITH THE NEWS 
APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH THAT THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND JENNY 
I KNOW 
NOTHING 
THIS IS THIS MORNING NOTHING ANNOUNCED A FIFTY BILLION RESCUE 
PACKAGE FOR BANKS HIT BY THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH SHE HAS NOT EVEN BEEN THERE 
YET IT'S ALREADY COSTING US FIFTY 
BILLION THE GOVERNOR MERVYN KING 
JENNY'S NEW BOSS HOPES THE SCHEME 
WILL HELP IMPROVE LIQUIDITY WITHIN 
THE SYSTEM BANKS WILL BE ABLE TO 
SWAP POTENTIALLY RISKY MORTGAGE 
DEBTS THAT ARE ON THEIR BOOKS FOR 
PRETTY TOTALLY SECURE GOVERNMENT 
BONDS THEY HOPE THIS WILL ABLE 
THEM TO OPERATE DURING THE CREDIT 
SQUEEZE BY LENDING MORE MONEY BACK 
INTO THE MORTGAGE MARKET AGAIN 
THIS AFTERNOON THE CHANCELLOR 
ALISTAIR DARLING WILL MAKE A 
STATEMENT ON THE PLAN TO THE HOUSE 
OF COMMONS YESTERDAY HE SAID THAT 
THE MOVE WOULD BEGIN THE PROCESS 
OF OPENING UP THE MORTGAGE MARKET 
WHICH WILL HELP HOUSEHOLDERS AT 
LEAST SO HE HOPES THERESA MAY IS 
THIS A GOOD IDEA 
OBVIOUSLY IT'S A 
GOOD IDEA FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
TO BE TRYING TO INTRODUCE LIQUIDITY 
INTO THE MARKET AND FREE UP THE 
MARKET SO WE CAN SEE MOVEMENT 
MOVEMENT IN THE MARKET AND LENDING 
TO PEOPLE AGAIN THE CRUCIAL ISSUE 
IS TO MAKE SURE THIS ISN'T JUST A 
BAILOUT THAT IT IS SOMETHING WHICH 
IS ABOUT FREEING UP THE MARKET AND 
THAT WILL THERE WILL BE A COST TO 
THE BANK 
IT IS A BAILOUT IF YOU 
SWAP YOUR POTENTIALLY DODGY 
MORTGAGE FOR A COPPER BOTTOMED 
TREASURY BILLS GOVERNMENT BONDS 
THAT'S A SUBSIDY TO THE BANKS 
PROVIDED THERE IS DISCOUNT AND 
FEE CHARGE THEY'RE NOT GETTING IT 
TOTALLY FREE THEY ARE HAVING TO PAY 
A PRICE FOR DECISIONS THEY'VE MADE 
IT IS IMPORTANT WE ALL KNOW WHAT 
THE MARK SET LOOKING LIKE IN TERMS 
OF MORTGAGES AND HOME OWNERS 
FINDING IT DIFFICULT AT THE MOMENT 
SO GETTING SOME LIQUIDITY FREEING 
UP THE SYSTEM IS NECESSARY TO TRY 
TO ENSURE WE CAN GET THE THINGS 
MOVING AGAIN 
I KNOW YOU WOULD SAY 
WE WOULDN'T HAVE STARTED HERE 
ANYWAY I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT ON 
THE TECHNIC TECHNIC KALITY OF WHAT 
THE PROFIT IS DOING YOU ARE 
BROADLY IN LINE 
FIRST OF ALL I 
KNOW THIS MAY SOUND LIKE ANOTHER 
TECHNIC TECHNICALITY IT'S A BANK OF 
ENGLAND'S DECISION IT HAS DECIDED 
LOOKING AT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES 
LOOKING AT THE MONEY MARKET THIS IS 
NECESSARY FOR BANKS TO FREE UP 
MORTGAGES TO HOPEFULLY GET THAT 
MARKET GOING AGAIN AND PROVIDED 
IT'S NOT JUST A BAILOUT PROVIDED 
THERE IS A FEE CHARGE IT'S AT A 
DISCOUNT SO THERE IS A PRICE BEING 
PAID THEN I THINK THIS IS A MOVE 
THAT IS SENSIBLE OBVIOUSLY WAIT TO 
HEAR WHAT THE DETAILS ARE 
WE WILL 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF IT DOESN'T 
WORK WE WILL HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT 
THE PLAN B. IS IF THERE IS ONE 
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US 
NOW IT'S TIME FOR OUR DAILY QUIZ TO 
GET YOUR BRAINS BUZZING INTO ACTION 
ON A MONDAY THE QUESTION RELATES 
TO OUR GUEST THERESA 
IS THE M. P. 
FOR MAIDENHEAD BUT WHAT EVENT IN 
THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS IS GOING TO TAKE 
PLACE IN MAIDENHEAD 
AT THE END OF THE PROGRAMME WE WILL 
ASK THERESA 
TO GIVE US THE 
CORRECT ANSWER F. YOU WANT TO SEND 
US YOUR COMMENTS DO GET E. MAILING 
WE WILL READ OUT SOME OF YOUR 
THOUGHTS LATER ON 
I DO HOPE IT'S THE BEACH VOLLEYBALL 
DOESN'T QUITE GO WITH MAIDENHEAD 
IT WOULD LIFEN THINGS UP IT WOULD 
BE WORTH A TRIP AFTER A DIFFICULT 
FEW MONTHS AT THE START OF THE YEAR 
GORDON BROWN MUST HAVE HOPED THAT 
THE EASTER RECESS WOULD GIVE HIM 
SOME BREATHING SPACE AS THE 
CHRISTMAS RECESS DID TO GET HIS 
GOVERNMENT'S ACT TOGETHER INSTEAD 
THE PAST TWO WEEKS WHILE WE HAVE 
BEEN AWAY HAVE SEEN GROWING 
CRITICISM OF THE POLICY WITH THE 
PRIME MINISTER'S FINGER PRINTS ALL 
OVER IT YES IT'S THE ABOLITION OF 
THIS TEN P. INCOME TAX BAND 
BACKBENCHERS ARE ANGRY THAT THE 
MOVE HITS MILLIONS OF LOW PAID 
HOUSEHOLDS AND THEY'VE BEEN 
PARADING ACROSS THE MEDIA TO CALL 
ON MR. BROWN TO REVERSE THE CHANGE 
THE ISSUE WILL COME TO A HEAD WITH 
A VOTE IN PARLIAMENT NEXT WEEK 
TONIGHT MR. BROWN WILL FACE HIS 
CRITICS IN THE PARTY AS HE CALLS 
FOR PARTY UNITY JENNY'S BEEN 
LOOKING AT WHY THIS ISSUE HAS COME 
TO A HEAD AS THE GOVERNMENT AND 
REBEL TEAMS FACEOFF 
YES THIS GAME OF UNIVERSALLY 
CHALLENGED KICKED OFF OVER A YEAR 
AGO BEFORE A REBEL TEAM HAD EVEN 
BEEN ASSEMBLED IN HIS LAST BUDGET 
GORDON BROWN THERE HIS STARTER FOR 
TEN WAS HIS DECISION TO ABOLISH 
THAT TEN P. INCOME TAX RATE TO PAY FOR 
A REDUCTION OF THE BASIC RATE FROM 
TWENTY TWO P. TO TWENTY P. IT WASN'T UNTIL A YEAR 
LATER THAT THE REBEL TEAM TURNED UP 
NOMINATING A FORMER MINISTER FRANK 
FIELD AS THEIR CAPTAIN ARGUING THAT 
THE ABOLITION MEANS THAT FIFTY THREE 
MILLION LOW INCOME WORKERS LOSE OUT 
UP TO SEVENTY BACKBENCHERS AND SIX 
MINISTERIAL AIDES HAVE ALSO VOICED 
CONCERN THINGS LOOKED BAD FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT WHEN WHISPERS SUGGESTED 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT AIDE 
NOT SURE 
WHICH TEAM SMITH 
ANGELA SMITH WAS 
ABOUT TO RESIGN OVER THE MATTER 
AFTER A TRANSATLANTIC PHONE CALL 
FROM THE PRIME MINISTER SHE LEFT 
THE REBEL TEAM 
GOVERNMENT DARLING 
ALISTAIR DARLING HAS HINTED THAT HE 
MAY MAKE CONCESSIONS PROMISING A 
REVIEW OF TAXATION FOR THE LOW PAID 
AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE AUTUMN 
BUT HE HAS ALSO STATED THAT IT JUST 
ISN'T POSSIBLE TO REWIND THE BUDGET 
MEANWHILE THE FOREIGN SECRETARY 
GOVERNMENT MILIBAND DAVID DAVID MILIBAND SEEMED TO CONFESS TO 
DISCOMFORT IN THE GOVERNMENT TEAM 
STATING THAT LABOUR IS NOW THE 
POLITICAL UNDERDOG THEN JUST TO 
KEEP THE PRESSURE ON FROM THE 
REBELS THERE WAS THE WEIGHTY 
INTERVENTION FROM 
REBELS CLARKE 
CHARLES CLARKE HE STATED 
DISAPPOINTMENT AT RECENT GOVERNMENT 
DECISIONS INCLUDING THAT ABOLITION 
OF THE TEN P. RATE THIS MORNING 
ALISTAIR DARLING HINTED THAT A 
RETHINK MIGHT BE ON THE CARDS IN 
THE AUTUMN 
WE ARE COMMITTED TO 
HELPING PEOPLE L. L. SAID YESTERDAY 
THAT I WILL RETURN TO THIS SUBJECT 
IN FUTURE BUDGETS MAYBE IN THE 
PRE BUDGET REPORT AS WELL BECAUSE 
I AM DETERMINED TO DO EVERYTHING I 
POSSIBLY CAN TO HELP PEOPLE ON LOW 
INCOMES I BELIEVE THAT'S ONE OF 
THE FUNDAMENTAL AIMS OF OUR 
GOVERNMENT AND I WILL RETURN TO IT 
THEN WHAT I CAN'T DO IS TO REWRITE 
A BUDGET A INTO THE FINANCIAL YEAR YEAR I AM JOINED BY THE B. B. C.'S POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT VICKY YOUNG IN 
PARLIAMENT WITH THE LATEST 
DEVELOPMENTS ON THIS AS M. P.'S RETURN 
TO WESTMINSTER WE MENTIONED AROUND 
ABOUT SEVENTY PEOPLE THERE VOICING 
CONCERN REALISTICALLY HOW MANY 
GENUINE REBELS DO YOU THINK THERE 
ARE 
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARE THOSE WHO VOICE CONCERN AND THOSE 
WHO WOULD VOTE AGAINST THE 
GOVERNMENT I THINK WE WILL GET A 
CLEARER SENSE TODAY THERE IS A 
DEBATE BUT M. P.'S CAN VOICE THEIR 
DISQUIET SO WE WILL GET A SENSE 
THERE THE TRUTH IS NO ONE REALLY 
KNOWS FRANK FIELD WHO IS TABLING 
AN AMENDMENT SAYS HE DOESN'T KNOW 
WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE THE 
KEY THING IS THE PROMISES OR 
SUGGESTIONS OF COMPENSATION WHAT 
DOES HE MEAN THE CHANCELLOR WHEN 
WILL THAT COME I DON'T KNOW IF 
THAT'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR MANY 
M. P.'S WITH MINISTERIAL AIDES TALKING 
PUBLICLY AGAINST THIS THE 
GOVERNMENT IS IN TROUBLE 
WHY ARE 
THEY TALKING SO PUBLICLY NOW AS WE 
SAID ALL THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED A 
YEAR AGO IT'S TAKEN THEM THIS LONG 
TO ADDRESS IT SHOULD WE READ INTO 
THAT THAT IT'S SOMETHING WIDER THAN 
THE TEN P. RATE AND IT'S LABOUR M. P.'S 
DISQUIETENED BY GORDON BROWN 
HIMSELF 
IT'S PARTLY A REFLECTION HIMSELF OF THE TROUBLE THAT GORDON BROWN IS 
IN ACCORDING TO THE OPINION POLLS 
THE FACT THAT HE IS LAGGING BEHIND 
BUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE 
FOR LABOUR M. P.'S MANY OF THEM DO NOT 
UNDERSTAND HOW GORDON BROWN COULD 
HAVE BROUGHT IN A BUDGET WHICH 
MEANT THE POOREST PEOPLE ARE WORSE 
OFF IT'S AN ISSUE OF CONSCIENCE IF 
YOU LIKE THERE IS DEFINITELY A 
BREAKDOWN IN DISCIPLINE YOU WERE 
SAYING TODAY ABOUT CHARLES CLARKE 
SAYING HE WAS DISAPPOINTED HIS 
LETTER TO THE TIMES ACTUALLY HAS A 
SPECIFIC GO AT ED BALLS THE SCHOOLS 
MINISTER SAYING EFFECTIVELY DON'T 
TALK TO ME ABOUT UNAUTHORISED 
BRIEFINGS YOU DID IT ALL THE TIME 
WHEN TONY BLAIR WAS IN OFFICE AND 
THE SENSE YOU GET IS THERE IS OLD 
SCORES BEING SETTLED AND THAT'S 
DANGEROUS TERRITORY FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT 
INTERESTING STUFF GOVERNMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
JOINING ME NOW IS THE LABOUR M. P. A. N. N. 
CRYER YOU ARE ONE OF THE M. P.'S WHO 
IS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ABOLITION 
OF THE TEN P. RATE WHY ARE YOU MAKING 
SUCH A STAND NOW WHY DIDN'T YOU DO 
IT A YEAR AGO 
BECAUSE A YEAR AGO I 
DIDN'T QUITE UNSTAND WHAT THE IMPAB 
WOULD BE L. THOUGHT THOSE IMPACT WOULD BE THOSE PEOPLE ON TEN TEN PER CENT WOULD CEASE TO PAY THAT WHAT I 
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT GO UP TO TWENTY 
IT'S STILL TWENTY WHICH IS MORE THAN 
THEY WERE PAYING BEFORE THE 
LETTERS I AM GETTING FROM MY 
CONSTITUENTS ARE REALLY VERY 
UPSETTING FOR ME BECAUSE THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE WRITING TO ME ARE 
THE THE PEOPLE WE SHOULD AND ABLE 
TO RELY ON IN ELECTIONS THAT I 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELY ON AT THE 
NEXT ELECTION THEIR LETTERS ARE 
VERY UPSETTING FOR ME L. AM NOT IN 
THE BUSINESS OF SETTLING OLD SCORES 
AS WAS SUGGESTED I AM IN THE 
BUSINESS OF SORTING THIS OUT AND I 
HOPE THAT FRANK WILL NOT NEED TO 
PUT HIS AMENDMENT NEXT WEEK I AM 
HOPING THAT ALISTAIR WILL COME UP 
WITH SOME SORT OF SCHEME WHERE BY 
HE WILL PROMISE DEFINITELY IN THE 
PRE BUDGET STATEMENT IN THE AUTUMN 
THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST OUT 
WILL BE COMPENSATED AND IT WILL BE 
BACKBAITED 
YOU MENTIONED 
BACKBAITED BACKBAITED YOU BACKDATED SURELY 
BY MAKING A PUBLIC REBELLION YOU 
ARE IN DANGER OF DOING THAT ANYWAY 
NOT FAR FROM LOCAL ELECTIONS YOU 
COULD BE HANDING THE TORIESA 
STUNNING P. R. COUP JUST DAYS BEFORE 
THE LOCAL ELECTIONS IF THIS 
AMENDMENT GOES THROUGH NEXT WEEK 
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WRITING TO ME 
ARE NOT THE MAJORITY ANYTHING LIKE 
AND WHATEVER THEY DO IN THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS IS NOT GOING TO HAVE AN 
ENORMOUS IMPACT BECAUSE THERE 
AREN'T ENOUGH OF THEM BUT THEY ARE 
PEOPLE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP ON 
MY SIDE BECAUSE THEY ARE SENSIBLE 
HARD WORKING AND DILIGENT PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE TROUBLED TO WRITE TO ME 
NOT A ROUND ROBIN NOT POSTCARD 
THEY'VE ACTUALLY HAND WRITTEN 
LETTERS TO ME TELLING ME WHAT 
THEIR FEARS ARE AND HOW IT'S 
HAVING AN IMPACT ON THEM 
WE MUST 
LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
OBVIOUSLY WE ASKED TO PEEK TO A 
MINISTER IN THE ASKED TO SPEAK TO 
A MINISTER IN THE TREASURY ABOUT 
THIS NONE WAS AVAILABLE WE ARE 
JOINED BY ANDY LOVE A MEMBER OF THE 
TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE WHY IS A 
GOVERNMENT THAT'S MADE SO MUCH OF 
THE EFFORTS IT'S PUT IN TO RAISING 
THE STANDARDS OF THE WORKING POOR 
WHY ARE YOU NOW PENALISING THE 
WORKING POOR WITH THIS TAX CHANGE 
I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE 
MEASURES IN THE ROUND THAT'S WHAT 
THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE DID 
WE DIDN'T JUST TAKE THE ABOLITION 
OF THE TEN P. RATE WE TOOK ALL THE 
THINGS THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING IN 
THIS BUDGET AND THERE ARE VERY GOOD 
MEASURES DEALING WITH CHILD POVERTY 
DEALING WITH THE ISSUES THAT AFFECT 
PENSIONERS 
BUT LOW PAID WORKERS PENSIONERS PARTICULARLY THOSE WITHOUT FAMILIES 
WILL BE WORSE OFF AS A RESULT OF 
THIS CHANGE NOW WHY WOULD YOU 
PENALISE THEM LET ME PERSONALISE 
IT WHY SHOULD A YOUNG BRITISH 
SOLDIER RISKING HIS LIFE IN 
AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ NOW BE PAYING 
MORE TAX 
WELL LET ME COME BACK TO 
THE POINT ONE WAS MAKING WHICH IS 
THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS IN THE 
ROUND WE HAVE ASKED WE EXPRESSED 
OUR DISAPPOINTMENT MUCH LIKE 
CHARLES CLARKE THAT IT WOULD 
APPEAR WHEN WE QUESTIONED THE 
TREASURY CAREFULLY ON THESE 
MEASURES T. WOULD APPEAR THAT SOME 
PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES ARE AFFECTED 
BUT THE FIGURES THAT ARE KEPT GIVEN 
OUT BY THE MEDIA AND BY OTHERS ARE 
WILDLY INACCURATE 
GIVE ME WHAT IS 
INACCURATE THE INSTITUTES THE 
FIGURES WE ARE USING ARE FROM THE 
INSTITUTE OF FISCAL STUDIES WHICH 
THE GOVERNMENT'S HAPPY TO QUOTE 
WHEN IT SUITS THE GOVERNMENT WELL WELL IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE INSTITUTE 
FOR FISCAL STUDIES SAYS IT SAYS 
THE PEOPLE IN THE BOTTOM TWO INCOME 
BRACKETS WILL BENEFIT MASSIVELY 
FROM THIS BUDGET THESE ARE COMPLEX 
AREAS 
FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WILL BE AREAS WORSE OFF LET ME COME BACK TO 
YOU SAY 
THAT'S THE POINT ONE AM 
TRYING TO MAKE FIVE MILLION IS NOT 
ACCURATE 
EVEN IF YOU TAKE IT IT IN ACCURATE THE ROUND A YOUNG TWENTY YEAR OLD 
SINGLE BRITISH SOLDIER IN 
AFGHANISTAN OR IRAQ RISKING HIS 
LIFE FOR YOUR GOVERNMENT WILL NOW 
BE PAYING MORE TAX TAKE THAT IN 
THE ROUND MR. LOVE 
WELL THE POINT 
LET ME COME BACK TO THE 
COMPLEXITY OF THESE ISSUES 
IS IT 
RIGHT HE WILL BE PAYING MORE TAX 
THAT'S WHAT WE 
DON'T KNOW YOU YOU DON'T KNOW 
BECAUSE EVERYBODY KEEPS 
GIVING THE TREASURY SELECT 
COMMITTEE DIFFERENT FIGURES ABOUT 
THE NUMBERS THAT ARE AFFECTED 
PEOPLE WILL BE AFFECTED L. AM NOT 
TRYING TO DENY THAT AND THAT'S WHY 
THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE 
EXPRESS ITS DISAPPOINTMENT LET'S LET'S GET IT RIGHT EVEN TAKING IT IN 
IT'S ROUND THERE ARE A A NUMBER OF 
SOME OF THE POOREST WORKERS PEOPLE 
WHO GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND 
WORK FOR PEANUTS UNDER A 
GOVERNMENT THEY WILL PAY MORE TAX 
WHY 
WE HAVE ASKED THE TREASURY TO WHY CARRY OUT SOME RESEARCH INTO THIS 
YOU HAVE HAD YEAR TO GET THE ANSWER 
WE HAVE ASKED WE DIDN'T ANSWER KNOW WHAT THE OVERALL PACKAGE WOULD 
BE UNTIL THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AND 
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE COME 
YOU HAD 
THIS BUDGET I MEAN GORDON BROWN 
ANNOUNCED IT WITH SUCH A GREAT 
FLOURISH HE STUCK IT UNDER THE 
COVERS IT WAS THE LAST THING HE 
SAID WAS THE TWO P. CUT WE LOOKED IN 
THE SMALL PRINT TO FIND OUT IT WAS 
BEING PAID BY DOUBLING THE STARTING 
RATE OF TAX WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK 
THEN 
WE DID ASK THEM BUT MORE ISSUES 
HAVE COME FORWARD IN THIS YEAR'S 
BUDGET THERE HAVE BEEN EXEMPLA 
VACATIONS ON THE WORKING TAX CREDIT 
PEOPLE ARE BEING PAID MORE KNOW 
THAT TAKE UP IN SINGLE PEOPLE IS 
NOT GOOD 
PEOPLE ARE WORKING HARD 
AND STILL PAYING TAX YOU ARE GOING 
TO MAKE THEM PAY MORE TAX YOU SAY 
TO THEM SOME OF YOU IF YOU HAVE 
FAMILIES IF YOU SIT CERTAIN 
CRITERIA YOU CAN CLAIM BACK WHAT 
IS THE POINT OF TAKING TAX AWAY 
WITH ONE HAND FROM THE POOREST 
PEOPLE IN SOCIETY HAVING A HUGE 
BUREAUCRACY AND COMPLICATED FORMS 
TO GIVE IT BACK WITH THE OTHER THE THE REALITY IS THAT THIS BUDGET IS 
MEANT TO SIMPLIFY THE TAX SYSTEM 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL THE VIEWERS 
BY HOW MUCH THE TAX GUIDE HAS 
INCREASED UNDER YOUR GOVERNMENT 
WELL THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE 
REASONS THE TREASURY 
IT HAS 
DOUBLED IN SIZE IT IS THE MOST 
COMPLICATED TAX SYSTEM IN THE 
WESTERN WORLD 
YOU WOULD THEREFORE 
AGREED WE NEED TO SIMPLIFY IT IT IT HAS STILL DOUBLED 
THERE ARE MOVES 
TO MAKE THE TAX SYSTEM SIMPLER AND 
EASIER TO UNDERSTAND REDUCING THE 
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT RATES GOES SOME 
WAY TO DOING THAT LET ME EMPHASISE 
WHAT I SAID THE TREASURY SELECT 
COMMITTEE DID EXPRESSED ITS 
DISAPPOINTMENT DID EXPRESS A A WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ARE YOU FOR THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PENCE RATE I I CAME IN AS A LABOUR MEMBER NOT TO 
PENALISE THE LESS WELL OFF IN THE 
SOCIETY SO I WOULD LIKE THE 
CHANCELLOR AS HE SAID THIS MORNING 
AND YESTERDAY ON TELEVISION TO 
LOOK CAREFULLY AT THESE MEASURES 
AND DO SOMETHING SO THAT THE LESS 
WELL OFF 
I STILL DON'T KNOW IF 
YOU ARE FOR OR AGAINST IT ARE YOU 
FOR OR AGAINST IT 
WE WILL OPPOSE 
THE CUT OF THE TEN PENCE TAX AS WE 
DID LAST YEAR LAST YEAR 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE BUDGET WE 
SAID IT WAS A TAX KONG BUDGET 
BECAUSE HE HAD TAKEN THE TEN P. RATE 
AWAY I HEAR WHAT ANDY SAYS ABOUT 
WANTING RESEARCH BUT THERE ARE 
PLENTY OF FIGURES AROUND THE 
INSTITUTE OF FISCAL STUDIES HAS 
SHOWN A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE HIT 
SO YOU WILL VOTE AGAINST THE 
DOUBLING OF THE STARTING RATE OF 
TAX 
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE TWO TAX ISSUES 
WILL YOU ALL WENT YOU WE ISSUES WE WILL OPPOSE THE ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN P. THERE IS AN ISSUE ABOUT 
AMENDMENTS WHICH WILL BE PLACED 
NEXT WEEK WE WILL BE PUT TO OUR 
OWN AMENDMENT THAT WE WILL LOOK AT 
THE OTHER ONES PUT DOWN IN TERMS OF 
WHAT YOU THEN DO 
THE ABOLITION OF 
THE TEN P. RATE GAVE THE GOVERNMENT 
SEVEN BILLION WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO 
GET THAT 
THIS IS AGAIN WHERE THE 
FIGURES COME INTO PLAY THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS HAVE YOU HAVE GOT 
TO OH SEVEN BILLION IF YOU LOOK AT 
COMPENSATING SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO 
WILL BE AFFECTED THE INSTITUTE OF 
FISCAL STUDIES HAS COME UP WITH SEVEN HUNDRED 
MILLION NOT SEVEN BILLION WHAT WE 
KNOW ABOUT ALASTAIR DARLING WHAT 
WE HAVE SEEN IN CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
AND NON DOMICILED IF HE IS PUSHED 
HE CAN MAKE CHANGES WE WANT TO 
PUSH HIM TO MAKE SURE HE MIX THE 
CHANGES SO THE POOREST PEOPLE IN A 
SOCIETY ARE NOT WORST OFF WORSE 
OFF 
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF IT OFF COST ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION BUT WE WILL 
LOOK AT THE FIGURES 
WITH GORDON BROWN STRUGGLING TO 
IMPOSE PARTY DISCIPLINE 
CONSERVATIVE LEADER DAVID CAMERON 
IS CURRENTLY SPORTING A FAIRLY 
LARGE SMILE HE IS AHEAD IN THE 
POLLS AND WITH LOCAL ELECTIONS IN 
JUST OVER A WEEK HE IS ON THE TEASING LABOUR BY 
INVITING A BOLD BLAIRITES TO JOIN 
HIM BUT JUST HOW WELL IS HE REALLY 
DOING AND CAN HE PASSED THE MAN OF 
THE PEOPLE TEST MATT STADLEN HAS 
BEEN TO READING WEST A MARGINAL 
LABOUR CONSTITUENCY TO SEE WHAT 
IMPACT MR. CAMERON HAS HAD THERE 
MR. CAMERON IS O. K. AND BIT WET WET 
COMPARED TO PREVIOUS TORY WET PARTY LEADERS HE IS CREDIBLE THE THE REST OF THE BUT I 
THINK THERE IS NOW A CREDIBLE 
OPPOSITION TO LABOUR IT DOESN'T 
MEAN I WOULD VOTE FOR HIM BUT THE 
TORY PARTY HAS BECOME CREDIBLE I I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 
DAVID CAL THAT AT ALL 
I DON'T 
THINK ANYONE DOES HE IS RATHER 
DISCREET 
HE HAS WHEN YOU LOOK AT DISCREET HIM IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND THE 
WAY HE ATTACKS THE LABOUR LEADER 
HE DOESN'T COME UP WITH ANY REAL 
IDEAS HE DOESN'T COME UP WITH 
ANSWERS IT IS ALWAYS ATTACK 
ATTACK ATTACK NEVER CREDIBLE 
IDEAS 
THAT IS WHAT POLITICIANS DO IDEAS THEY ARE THERE TO ATTACK L. DON'T 
VOTE BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY TRUST 
WOULD ANY OF THEM SAY THEY WILL 
SAY ANYTHING TO GET MY VOTE BUT 
WHEN THEY GET BUT THEY GET IT 
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO CARRY ON 
AS BEFORE 
TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD SCOT IS 
WORKING FOR HIS DAD'S BUILDING 
SUPPLIERS HE VOTED TORY LAST TIME 
WILL YOU VOTE FOR THE NEXT TIME 
DEFINITELY I WILL LOOK INTO IT 
LABOUR HAD DONE MUCH TO HELP SMALL 
BUSINESSES HAVEN'T DONE PRE TAX 
COST ON EVERYTHING L. HAVEN'T 
PICKED ANY SIDES I'M NOT TOO SURE 
ON THE POLICIES OF THE TORIES AT 
THE MOMENT I AM UNDECIDED 
BACK ON 
THE HIGH STREET PHIL GOODSHIP HAS 
BEEN MENDING SHOES IN READING FOR 
FIFTY YEARS HE HAS ONLY VOTED TORY 
ONCE DURING THE THATCHER YEARS 
THIS GOVERNMENT DOESN'T SEEM VERY 
STRONG TO ME HE SEEMS A PLEASANT 
ENOUGH FELLOW BUT AS LEADER I'M 
NOT SURE 
BUT SUCH SCEPTICISM ABOUT 
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS STILL PLENTY 
OF HARD WORK AHEAD FOR THE TORIES 
IF WANT TO STRENGTHEN THEIR 
LEAD IN THE POLLS 
THAT WAS MATT STADLEN REPORTING 
THERESA MAY IS WITH US WOULD IT 
NOT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THE PUBLIC 
IS TURNING AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT 
IN TERMS OF POPULAR SENTIMENT BUT 
IS NOT YET TURNING IN FAVOUR OF THE 
TORIES OR MR. CAMERON PARTLY 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU 
STAND FOR 
THE PUBLIC ARE CERTAINLY 
TURNING AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND 
THEY ARE TURNING TOWARDS US THERE 
ARE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET TURNED 
TOWARDS US YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT 
THAT CERTAINLY 
MADE 
THE COMMENT ABOUT MORE WORK NEEDING 
TO BE DONE WE HAVE NEVER SAID WE 
ARE COMPLACENT DESPITE THE LEAD WE 
HAVE HAD IN THE OPINION POLLS WE 
RECOGNISE THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE 
DONE IN PRESENTING A POSITIVE 
PACKAGE OF WHAT WE WILL DO IN 
GOVERNMENT YOU SAW SOME OF THOSE 
MEASURES COMING OUT AT KARK SPRING 
FORUM WHICH TOOK PLACE LAST MONTH 
ON HEALTH VISITORS FLEXIBLE 
PARENTAL LEAVE OUR SPRING FORUM 
THESE ARE POSITIVE POLICIES YOU YOU HAVE NOT YET GOT THROUGH TO THE 
PUBLIC WHOLE SWATHES OF POLICY WE 
STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TORIES 
STAND FOR ALL WHAT MR. CAMERON WOULD 
STAND FOR 
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT WHAT WE WILL STAND FOR WE 
ARE TALKING ABOUT A MORE 
RESPONSIBLE SOCIETY A GREENER 
SAVE FOR BRITAIN 
EVERYBODY IS IN 
FAVOUR OF THAT 
LET'S GO BEHIND 
THAT THEN 
WHAT ABOUT THE N. H. S. MR. 
CAMERON SAYS HE IS AGAINST 
POLYCLINICS 
YOU CHALLENGE ME ON POLYCLINICS THE RESPONSIBLE SOCIETY AND SAY 
THAT IS A FINE PHRASE TO USE IT IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING 
BUT THE 
GOVERNMENT BELIEVES IF THE PROBLEM 
ARISES OR THEY HAVE TO DO IS PASS 
ANOTHER LAW AND BEHAVIOUR CHANGES 
WE RECOGNISE THAT IS NOT THE CASE 
WE ARE IN IT TOGETHER GOVERNMENT 
HAS A ROLE TO PLAY BUT THERE ARE 
OTHER THINGS TO BE DONE THAT WILL 
BE DONE BY STRENGTHENING 
COMMUNITIES GIVING PEOPLE LOCAL 
DECISION TAKING THESE THINGS ARE 
UNDERPINNING WHAT WE ARE DOING AS 
CONSERVATIVES 
WE YOU DO WELL ON CONSERVATIVES MAY FIRST 
I THINK WE WILL MAKE 
PROGRESS 
WE YOU WIN LONDON LONDON PROGRESS LONDON IS LOOKING VERY INTERESTING THAT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS WINNING IT WAS 
UP I NEVER PREDICT ELECTION 
RESULTS YOU CAN'T BLAME ME FOR 
TRYING TRYING LOTS OF E. MAILS COMING IN THE TEN P. 
RATE HAS HIT A NERVE PAULINE 
BATCHELOR SAYS SHE HAS FOUR 
DAUGHTERS AGED FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY THREE ALL 
WORKING ALL WILL PAY MORE TAX 
BILL DIXON FROM PETERBOROUGH 
RECKONS THE TORIES ARE BEING 
OPPORTUNISTIC IN THEIR CONCERN FOR 
THE LOW PAID HE POINTS OUT THEY 
ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSED 
THE MINIMUM WAGE AND WOULD INCREASE 
INHERITANCE TAX THRESHOLD PAUL 
SAYS SURELY IT IS SIMPLE CYNICAL 
POLITICS FAR MORE VOTERS ARE 
GETTING A TWO PENCE TAX CUT THAT A 
RISE SO MORE HAPPY VOTERS JOB 
DONE DONE EVEN AS THEY WERE TALKING MORE E. 
MAILS COMING IN KEEP THEM COMING 
YESTERDAY'S AND TODAY'S PAPERS WERE 
ABOUT DETAILS OF THE FORMER DEPUTY 
PRIME MINISTER REMEMBER HIM JOHN 
PRESCOTT HIS REVELATION THAT HE 
SUFFERED FROM EATING DISORDER 
BULIMIA NERVOSA DURING HIS YEARS IN 
OFFICE PREZZA WAS FREQUENTLY THE 
BUTT OF JOKES ABOUT HIS SIZE HE 
SAYS HE HOPES THAT WRITING ABOUT 
HOW HE SOUGHT HELP FOR THE 
CONDITION WILL ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO 
DO THE SAME 
I NEVER ADMITTED TO THIS COURT OF 
THE SHAME AND EMBARRASSMENT L. 
FOUND IT DIFFICULT A MAN LIKE ME 
TO ADMIT I SUFFERED FROM BULIMIA 
THE DOCTORS TOLD ME IT WAS PROBABLY 
DUE TO STRESS L. SUFFERED BULIMIA 
FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS AND I EVENTUALLY 
MANAGED TO IT AND STOP IT A 
FEW YEARS AGO 
WE ARE JOINED FROM 
SHEFFIELD BY A CLOSE FRIEND OF JOHN 
PRESCOTT FORMER GOVERNMENT 
MINISTER RICHARD CABORN YOU KNOW 
JOHN PRESCOTT VERY WELL YOU ARE 
CLOSE FRIEND DID YOU KNOW HE WAS 
HAVING THESE PROBLEMS 
I DIDN'T 
KNOW PARTICULARLY ABOUT BULIMIA 
BUT I KNEW HIS EATING HABITS 
WEREN'T PARTICULARLY GOOD A FEW 
YEARS AGO WHEN ALAN MILBURN WAS 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH 
JOHN ALSO MADE PUBLIC HE HAD 
DIABETES THAT WAS WELCOMED THAT 
HE CAME OUT WITH THAT HE HELPED 
SIGNIFICANTLY THE DEPARTMENT OF 
HEALTH IN TRACKING DOWN QUITE A LOT 
ON THE QUESTION OF DIABETES JOHN 
HAS DONE THIS AGAIN SAYING I HAVE 
HAD THIS DISORDER THE FUND THAT 
HAS BEEN MADE IN SOME OF THE MEDIA 
SHOWED WHY SOME PEOPLE IN PUBLIC 
OFFICE WILL NOT COME OUT WHEN THEY 
HAVE THESE DISORDERS BECAUSE THEY 
GET RIDICULED OR IT GETS 
INTERPRETED IN DIFFERENT WAY THAT 
IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE 
THIS SPORTS PEOPLE AND PEOPLE IN 
THE MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT COMING 
OUT AND SAYING I HAVE GOT THESE 
PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF STRESS OR 
WHATEVER IS GOOD AND MAKES PEOPLE 
THINK THEY CAN COME OUT AND SPEAK 
TO THE MEDICAL AUTHORITIES WHICH 
IS RIGHT 
MR. PRESCOTT DID MENTION 
THE STRESS OF BEING AN M. P. IS THERE 
A LOT OF SUPPORT AROUND FOR M. P.'S 
TWO LOTS OF M. P.'S TURN TO THIS KIND 
OF THING OR SOME KIND OF PROP 
DO LOTS OF M. P.'S 
I DON'T KNOW THE 
ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION L. THINK 
THERE IS SUPPORT GIVEN NOT AS GOOD 
AS IT OUGHT TO BE BUT AT THE END 
OF THE DAY IT IS THE STRESS THE 
STRESS OF THE MEDIA YOU SEE HOW 
THE MEDIA HAS REACTED TO JOHN WHO 
IS NOW OUT OF OFFICE 
BUT THAT GOES 
WITH THE TERRITORY 
IT PUTS STRESS 
ON PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC EYE 
THERESA MAY THAT GOES WITH THE 
TERRITORY BEING POLITICIAN VERY VERY MUCH SO 
SORRY MR. CABORN L. WAS 
QUESTIONING TERESA MAY 
STRESS DOES 
BUT IT AFFECTS PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT 
WAYS TO STOP I THINK JOHN PRESCOTT 
HAS BEEN PRETTY BRAVE IN BEING 
WILLING TO COME FORWARD AND SAY 
YES I HAD THIS PROBLEM L. HOPE 
BECAUSE WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH 
EATING DISORDERS IN THIS COUNTRY 
THAT IT WILL ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO 
COME FORWARD 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING
