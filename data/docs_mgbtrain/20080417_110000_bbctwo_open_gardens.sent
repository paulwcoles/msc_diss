EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF BRITISH GARDENERS 
TRY TO GET A PLACE IN THE YELLOW BOOK 
THIS GUIDE PUBLISHED BY THE NATIONAL GARDEN SCHEME 
LISTS PRIVATE GARDENS JUDGED TO SUCH A HIGH STANDARD 
THAT THEY CAN OPEN THEIR GATES FOR CHARITY 
THOSE WHO ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO OPEN THEIR GARDENS TO THE PAYING PUBLIC 
BUT OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED WHO APPLY YEARLY ONLY HALF GET THROUGH 
THE STANDARDS ARE HIGH AND THE ASSESSING RUTHLESS' 
WELL THERE ISN'T ANY INTEREST IS THERE 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
THIS IS A MONSTROSITY 
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SAY NO 
I OUGHT TO SAY NO FOR THIS YEAR I'M GOING TO SAY NO 
I'LL BE FOLLOWING AVID GARDENERS 
STRIVING TO TURN THEIR PRIVATE PARADISES INTO OPEN GARDENS' 
I'LL BE MEETING TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE HOPING THEIR GARDEN MAKES THE GRADE 
IF I DIDN'T GET INTO THE N. G.S YES IT WOULD BE A DISAPPOINTMENT 
BUT HOPEFULLY IT WON'T HAPPEN 
HAVING WORKED ON THIS GARDEN FOR SIXTEEN YEARS 
MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES FAMILY AND FRIENDS WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT 
WILL TODAY'S GARDENS HAVE WHAT IT TAKES 
TO GET ACCEPTED INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
TODAY'S FIRST GARDEN BELONGS TO PAT CROUCH IN EAST SUSSEX 
THIS IS AN INTERESTING GARDEN 
PAT IS A COMPLETE PLANTAHOLIC 
AND SHE'S PACKED IT FULL OF A HUGE RANGE OF PLANTS 
THERE ARE SOME LOVELY THEMED AREAS AND QUIRKY ORNAMENTS DOTTED AROUND 
IT'S EVEN GOT ITS VERY OWN FOLLY 
PAT HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS KOOKY COASTAL GARDEN 
IN BEXHILL ON SEA FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS 
USING IT AS A HAVEN AWAY FROM THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF MODERN LIFE 
I STARTED GARDENING ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO 
WHEN I WAS POORLY 
AND I JUST WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO GET ME AWAY FROM PEOPLE 
AND I COULD LOSE MYSELF OUT IN THE GARDEN 
AND JUST ENJOY NATURE 
THIS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY BY SEVENTY F. T. SUSSEX TOWN GARDEN 
BRINGS YOU ROUND A GRAVELLED AREA TO THE LAWN 
SURROUNDED BY HERBACEOUS BORDERS 
THE LAWN TAKES YOU THROUGH A COUPLE OF ARCHES 
TO PAT'S FOLLY OF A COUNTRY STYLE 
IT WASN'T UNTIL PAT BECAME ILL 
THAT SHE GOT HER TEETH INTO GARDENING 
I HAD A BREAKDOWN THE FIRST ONE I HAD WAS TEN YEARS AGO 
THE LAST ONE SIX YEARS AGO 
SINCE THEN I'VE SPENT MORE TIME IN THE GARDEN 
AND IT'S A GREAT THERAPY 
IT'S A WAY OF FORGETTING EVERYTHING 
AND I TEND TO SPEND MORE IN THE GARDEN 
THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY 
PAT'S WISH TO OPEN FOR THE YELLOW BOOK 
IS DRIVEN BY A PERSONAL LOSS' 
I LOST A COUPLE OF FRIENDS A FEW YEARS BACK TO CANCER 
AND IT SORT OF MAKES YOU REALISE WHAT THE CHARITIES DO 
TO HELP BOTH THE CARERS AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ILL 
THE N. G.S IS AN EXCELLENT ORGANISATION 
BECAUSE IT SUPPORTS SO MANY CHARITIES 
THAT'S MY WAY OF HELPING 
LUCKILY I'VE GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND MORE ABOUT PAT 
HOW DOES GARDENING MAKE YOU FEEL 
YOU LOSE YOURSELF IT'S LOVELY 
LISTENING TO THE BIRDS TALKING TO THE WORMS AND ANYTHING 
IT'S REALLY RELAXING 
IT'S HARD WORK I CAN'T WALK WHEN I STAND UP 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL STORY AND THE GARDEN 
IT HELPED YOU THROUGH SOME TOUGH TIMES DIDN'T IT 
YEAH I HAD A BREAKDOWN QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO 
AND I WAS TOLD TO DO THINGS THAT I ONLY LIKED DOING 
AND SO THAT'S WHEN I THINK I GOT STUCK INTO GARDENING 
COS YOU LOSE YOURSELF AND NOTHING ELSE REALLY MATTERS 
IT'S NICE IT'S VERY THERAPEUTIC 
YOU DON'T SEEM TO EVER STOP YOU'RE TWEAKING AREAS HERE AND THERE 
I USED TO LOVE SUNBATHING AND I CAN'T NOW 
I SIT DOWN AND I THINK OH I'LL JUST DO THAT AND I'M OFF 
AND THAT'S IT AGAIN 
IT'S RUINED MY SUNBATHING 
IT'S MUCH BETTER FOR YOU THAN SUNBATHING 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE GETTING STUCK IN 
BUT NOW YOU FEEL THAT IT'S READY TO GO INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S READY NOW 
FRIENDS I'VE HAD COME ROUND SAY HOW WONDERFUL IT IS 
THEY LOVE IT AND SAY WHY DON'T YOU GO FOR IT 
I FEEL HAPPY WITH IT 
THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT I THINK NEEDS DOING 
GOOD LUCK WITH THE ASSESSMENT I HOPE IT GOES REALLY WELL 
I THINK PAT AND HER GARDEN HAVE SO MUCH TO OFFER 
BUT THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT I DON'T THINK ARE QUITE WORKING 
THERE'S THE GRAVEL GARDEN OVER THERE BUT THERE'S TOO MUCH GRAVEL IN IT 
IT'S MISSING SOMETHING 
THIS GRASS BORDER IS A BIT INCONSISTENT 
THERE'S BARE SOIL AND CLUSTERS OF GRASSES IT NEEDS EVENING OUT 
WILL THE COUNTY ORGANISER PICK UP ON THESE 
THE PERSON PAT HAS TO HOPE WON'T BE TOO VICIOUS 
IS THE COUNTY ORGANISER FOR EAST SUSSEX ROSIE LLOYD 
I CAN ALMOST ALWAYS TELL WHETHER A GARDEN IS GOING TO PASS OR FAIL 
HER OWN GARDEN COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT FROM PAT'S 
I MIGHT NOT LIKE GNOMES OR ORNAMENTS 
BUT LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE DO 
OUR SECOND GARDEN IS IN THE HEART OF RURAL SURREY 
THIS IS A TWO ACRE GARDEN WITH A STRONG MUSICAL THEME 
THERE'S SOME WATER SCULPTURES 
WHICH TAKE THE SHAPE OF A PIANO A HARP AND A SAX 
THERE'S A NATURALISED POND AND BARBARA'S TURNED THIS ARCHERY GLADE 
INTO A STRIKING FORMAL GARDEN 
THE GARDEN BELONGS TO BARBARA RUBENSTEIN 
WHO HAS LIVED AT SMITHWOOD HOUSE FOR SIXTEEN YEARS 
LOVINGLY CREATING A SPACE OF BEAUTY AND SERENITY 
I'VE HAD A LOVE OF GARDENING ALL MY LIFE REALLY 
WE ALL HAD OUR OWN GARDEN PATCH AS CHILDREN 
I THINK I TOOK THAT ON REALLY THROUGH MY LIFE 
EVERYWHERE WE'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH PLANTS TO SOME EXTENT 
THIS SITE HAS A BIT OF A MUSICAL THEME 
WITH ITS THREE OVERSIZED WATER FEATURE SCULPTURES 
THE GARDEN IS A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
AND HAS A YEW WALK A NATURAL POND IN THE CENTRE 
SHRUB BOARDERS TOPIARY AND A SELECTION OF FANTASTIC MATURE TREES 
BARBARA WOULD LOVE TO OPEN UP HER GARDEN 
HAVING WORKED ON THIS PARTICULAR GARDEN FOR SIXTEEN YEARS 
I FELT IT HAD REACHED A STAGE 
WHERE MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES DIRECT FAMILY AND FRIENDS 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT AND SPEND TIME IN IT 
THERE'S THE CHARITABLE ASPECT TO THE N. G.S 
IT'S QUITE AMAZING HOW MUCH THEY MAKE FOR CHARITY 
AROUND THIS AREA JUST BY OPENING YOUR BACK GARDEN 
SO IT'S A VERY WORTHWHILE VENTURE 
BARBARA WHAT DOES GARDENING MEAN TO YOU 
WELL IT MEANS A GREAT DEAL I THINK IT'S A REFUGE 
IT'S A PLACE TO ESCAPE TO 
IT'S A PLACE THAT I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN OVER THE YEARS IT'S GROWN UP AROUND ME 
WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED YOU WANT TO GET IT INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
I THINK AFTER SIXTEEN YEARS OF GARDENING IN THIS GARDEN IT WOULD BE AN ACHIEVEMENT 
IT'S REACHED A LEVEL 
WHERE IT WOULD BE NICE FOR PEOPLE TO WALK AROUND AND ENJOY IT 
AND YOU FEEL CONFIDENT THAT IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE YELLOW BOOK 
THAT I DON'T KNOW 
I JUST FEEL THAT THERE PROBABLY IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS 
SO THERE'S ENOUGH TIME WISE FOR PEOPLE TO WALK AROUND 
WHO KNOWS SOME OF THE GARDENS ROUND HERE ARE AMAZING 
SO THE STANDARDS ARE HIGH PARTICULARLY HIGH I THINK YEAH 
ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT 
I THINK EVERYBODY'S NERVOUS WHEN SOMEBODY LOOKS ROUND THEIR GARDEN 
YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY 
IT'S ALL VERY SUBJECTIVE 
ONE PERSON LIKES ONE THING AND ANOTHER ANOTHER 
SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'LL SAY 
AT FIRST GLANCE THIS GARDEN LOOKS ALMOST FLAWLESS' 
BUT SOME WOULD SAY THIS GARDEN HASN'T GOT ENOUGH COLOUR 
SOME AREAS ARE A BIT MESSY LIKE UNDERNEATH THIS EUCALYPTUS 
I MEAN WHAT'S THIS 
A DANDELION WEEDS IN A YELLOW BOOK 
NO NO NO NO NO 
THE PERSON STANDING IN THE WAY OF BARBARA'S DREAMS IS GAIL LEADER 
GAIL'S OWN GARDEN IS EVERY BIT AS PERFECT AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE 
A SENSE OF TIDINESS THROUGHOUT 
AND OBVIOUSLY TOO MANY BARE PATCHES BARE SOIL 
WITH NOTHING GROWING THAT'S OF NO INTEREST TO ANYBODY 
PEOPLE HAVE INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT IDEAS 
AS TO WHAT IS A GOOD GARDEN 
OCCASIONALLY YOU GO TO ONE AND YOU THINK 
OH DEAR THIS ONE IS NOT GOING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH 
TODAY IT'S TIME FOR OUR TWO GARDENS TO FACE THE ULTIMATE TEST 
THE QUESTION IS WILL THEY BE GOOD ENOUGH 
ROSIE LLOYD IN EAST SUSSEX 
ARRIVES AT PAT'S QUIRKY GARDEN IN BEXHILL ON SEA 
HELLO PAT I'M ROSIE LLOYD FROM THE NATIONAL GARDEN SCHEME 
WILL HER BARE GRAVEL AREA AND GRASSY BED BE HER DOWNFALL 
GAIL HAS ALREADY ARRIVED TO ASSESS BARBARA'S MUSICALLY THEMED GARDEN 
HELLO I'M GAIL LEADER COUNTY ORGANISER 
PLEASED TO MEET YOU 
LET'S HOPE THE LACK OF COLOUR DOESN'T LET HER DOWN 
OH THIS LOOKS FASCINATING 
IT'S LIKE A FULL SIZE PIANO 
AND IF YOU PRESS THESE KEYS WHICH THE KIDDIES LOVE TO DO IN THE SUMMER MONTHS 
SO DO THE GROWN UPS 
THAT'S WONDERFUL I LIKE THIS 
WONDERFUL IDEA WHOEVER HAD IT YES GREAT 
THE START OF BARBARA'S ASSESSMENT SEEMS TO BE HITTING ALL THE RIGHT NOTES 
FOR PAT IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT STORY 
IS THIS THE WAY THE PUBLIC WOULD COME THROUGH 
YES YES 
DO YOU THINK IT'S SUITABLE FOR WHEELCHAIR ACCESS 
NO IT'S QUITE FULL HERE AND THERE'S GRAVEL AREAS FURTHER DOWN 
THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET A WHEELCHAIR ROUND THAT'S A PITY 
NOW WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE THIS IS MY GRAVEL BED 
I'M GOING TO HAVE SWEET PEAS HERE PROBABLY 
I DON'T DECIDE TILL LATER ON 
LOTS OF THINGS FLOWERING HERE COS AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S A BIT BLAND THERE'S NOT A LOT HAPPENING 
COULD NO WHEELCHAIR ACCESS AND THE GRAVEL AREA 
HAVE RUINED PAT'S CHANCES 
AT SMITHWOOD HOUSE THEY'VE REACHED THE POND 
THAT'S NICE YOU COME DOWN THE PATH AND COME ACROSS THE POND 
I LIKE THAT VERY NATURAL SORT OF FEEL 
WHAT'S THIS HERE THIS BED LOOKS A BIT UNHAPPY 
YEAH THIS AREA HAS BEEN DIFFICULT 
IT'S UNDERNEATH A BIG EUCALYPTUS 
THIS MAY HAVE SEEN BETTER DAYS I DIDN'T GET THEM IN EARLY ENOUGH 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE STILL WITH YOU OR NOT 
IT'S A DIFFICULT AREA WHICH NEEDS THOUGHT 
IT'S STILL NOT GOING TOO WELL FOR PAT 
THIS IS MY GRASS BED OH WOW YES 
THAT'S JOLLY ADVENTUROUS THERE SEEM TO BE HOLES 
A STRONG WIND BROUGHT A BIG SHRUB DOWN THERE SO WE TOOK IT OUT 
MY FRIEND SAID THEY LOOK DEAD BUT I LIKE GRASSES 
JUST WHEN IT SEEMED LIKE GAIL COULDN'T FIND ANY FAULTS 
THE WHOLE GARDEN IS STILL QUITE GREEN THOUGH ISN'T IT 
ONE FEELS MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF COLOUR 
A FORMAL AREA IS VERY NICE 
PROVIDED THERE'S COLOUR SOMEWHERE IN THE GARDEN 
A LACK OF COLOUR COULD BE QUITE SERIOUS FOR BARBARA 
BUT IT'S NOTHING LIKE THE CLANGER PAT DROPS IN EAST SUSSEX 
AN INTERESTING GARDEN SHED YES 
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE FOR SERVING TEAS 
OH WE WON'T BE DOING TEAS I DON'T THINK 
TEAS AND CAKES ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ANY OPENING 
PAT'S UNWILLINGNESS TO DO TEAS COULD BE HER DOWNFALL 
THE ASSESSMENT HAS COME TO AN END FOR BOTH GARDENS 
AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE VERDICTS' 
THE WATER FEATURES ARE A BIG ATTRACTION 
IF CHILDREN COME ALONG AND PLAY THE PIANO 
THAT'S REALLY NICE 
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE N. G.S 
IS NOT REALLY ABOUT WATER FEATURES HOWEVER WONDERFUL THEY ARE 
PAT THIS HAS BEEN AN EXPLORATION OF GREAT FUN 
I'VE REALLY ENJOYED LOOKING AROUND YOUR GARDEN 
THE ACCESS IS QUITE NARROW SO NO WHEELCHAIRS WHICH IS A PITY 
I CAN SEE IT ISN'T SUITABLE AT ALL 
THE BED BY THE POND THERE THAT NEEDS SORTING OUT 
AND PERHAPS A BIT OF HERBACEOUS SOMEWHERE 
PERHAPS YOUR GRAVEL GARDEN OVER THERE 
COULD DO WITH A BIT OF PLAYING AROUND WITH 
MAKING IT MORE INTERESTING 
TIDYING UP THE GRASS GARDEN WITH FLOWERS 
GARDENS TO ME ARE FLOWERS AND YOU NEED A BIT MORE COLOUR HERE 
THE OTHER THING THAT WORRIES ME IS THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING TEAS PEOPLE DO LIKE TEA AND CAKE 
SO IS IT A YES OR A NO FOR BARBARA 
BUT IF THOSE THINGS COULD BE SORTED OUT 
WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU IN THE YELLOW BOOK 
GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I'M NOT SURPRISED BARBARA'S MADE IT 
SHE'S NOW GOT THREE MONTHS TO GET SOME COLOUR INTO HER GARDEN 
BEFORE SHE OPENS FOR THE PAYING PUBLIC 
IT'S LOVELY TO THINK PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO COME HERE 
AND ENJOY THEMSELVES 
SO IT'LL BE A PLEASURE AND I'M PLEASED 
AT BEXHILL ON SEA COULD THE LACK OF TEAS AND CAKES BE A DEAL BREAKER 
BUT ALL IN ALL I THINK IT'S AN AMAZING GARDEN 
I THINK NATIONAL GARDEN SCHEME WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU IN 
WELCOME TO THE N. G.S THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT SHE'S MADE IT 
PAT'S NOW GOT LOADS OF JOBS TO DO BEFORE HER GARDEN OPENS 
ALTHOUGH BAKING CAKES WON'T BE ONE OF THEM 
I'M PLEASED I'VE GOT INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE WANTED TO HAVE DONE FOR A LONG TIME 
TO HAVE PEOPLE LOOKING AT THE GARDEN IS REALLY GOOD 
IT'S MID APRIL AND WE'RE AT PAT'S QUIRKY GARDEN IN BEXHILL ON SEA 
SHE'S ALREADY DEALT WITH WHAT WAS AN UNINSPIRING GRAVEL AREA 
BY ADDING A REPLICA WELL AND BUCKET 
CONGRATULATIONS PAT THANK YOU 
YOU MADE IT YES AND I'M REALLY PLEASED 
IT'S A FABULOUS GARDEN THE VISITORS ARE GONNA LOVE IT 
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT I HOPE SO 
I SEE YOU'VE PUT A WELL IN IT'S GREAT 
IT'S RATHER NICE YOU LIKE IT 
YEAH DID YOU BUILD IT MY HUSBAND AND I DID IT 
LISTEN I'VE GOT A FORK IN MY HAND RIGHT 
WHAT'S THE PLAN 
WELL THAT'S RATHER A BIG CLUMP 
AND IT COULD BE SPLIT IF IT'S O. K. TO DO IT 
OH I DO LIKE YOUR SANDY SOIL ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO GRASSES 
OH O. K. LET'S PUT IT ON THE LAWN 
VOILA LOVELY 
SO THE OLD BACK TO BACK FORK TECHNIQUE 
ONE GOES IN THE OTHER GOES IN 
AND YOU PRISE THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER 
IT'S REALLY EFFECTIVE 
I'M GONNA PUT ONE IN RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE 
AND GET MY FOOT ON IT 
THAT'S IN RIGHT 
NOW IF YOU STICK YOUR FORK IN 
NOW WE PUSH AGAINST EACH OTHER 
YEAH I THINK IT'S GONNA BE REALLY TRICKY TO BREAK THAT APART 
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IF IT'S THIS DRY 
AND IT'S THIS COMPACTED THE ROOT BALL 
I'LL TAKE MY FORK OUT 
GET A SPADE ON IT AND CUT RIGHT THROUGH IT 
O. K. 
YOU KEEP YOUR FORK THERE 
THAT WILL JUST GO RIGHT THROUGH OH BRILLIANT 
THERE YOU GO 
SPLIT THAT ONE AGAIN AND WE'LL END UP WITH THREE NICE PLANTS 
THIS WILL GO IF I WHACK THAT THROUGH THERE 
READY FOR IT YEAH 
RIGHT THERE YOU GO YOU'VE GOT THREE PLANTS NOW 
MIXED IN WITH YOUR OTHER GRASSES YOU'VE GOT LOADS TO PLAY WITH 
PAT MAY MAKE OUT THAT HER GARDEN HASN'T BEEN THOUGHT OUT BUT THAT'S NOT COMPLETELY TRUE 
THIS GARDEN HAS ITS VERY OWN STYLE 
IT REALLY DOES ITS OWN STYLE 
ACTUALLY IT'S A VERY CLEVER DESIGN DEVICE 
TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE GARDEN NEVER QUITE FINISHES 
YOU COULD USE TRELLIS OR TALL PLANTING 
ANYTHING TO GIVE THE SENSE THAT THE GARDEN JUST GOES ON FOREVER 
BARBARA WAS ACCEPTED INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
HER LACK OF COLOUR WAS A PROBLEM 
ESPECIALLY UNDER HER EUCALYPTUS TREE BY THE POND 
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH THIS AREA IT'S NOT WORKING IS IT 
WELL IT SEEMS TO BE GOVERNED BY THIS EUCALYPTUS TREE 
WHICH TAKES SO MUCH OF THE MOISTURE OUT OF THE SOIL 
EVERYTHING WE DO TRY AND GROW EITHER ENDS UP VERY SMALL OR DIES 
AS YOU CAN SEE 
LOOK IT'S A FANTASTIC TREE IT IS 
YOU'VE GOT THIS LILAC UNDER HERE THAT SEEMS TO BE STRUGGLING 
IT'S COMING OUT AT A FUNNY ANGLE 
YOU'VE GOT SOME WEEDS SOME RHODOS 
YOU'VE GOT GROUND COVERING TYPE ROSE GOING ON IN HERE AS WELL 
A SHORT TERM SOLUTION IS CLEAR IT ALL OUT 
TRY AND CUT BACK EVERYTHING THAT'S GETTING IN THE WAY 
LEAVE THE RHODOS AND THE ROSE AND THE MAIN PLANTS IN THERE 
THEN PLANT SOMETHING IN BETWEEN THEM 
IF YOU WANTED A BIT OF COLOUR 
YOU COULD GO FOR BUSY LIZZIES IF YOU LIKE THOSE 
SOME ARE GARISH 
OR JUST SOME GROUND COVER PERENNIALS THAT WILL FILL THE GAP 
PLANTING EN MASSE TO SUPPRESS THE WEEDS 
THEY SHOULD COPE WITH THE DRY SHADE WHAT DO YOU THINK SOUNDS GOOD 
SHALL I START DIGGING A FEW WEEDS OUT 
SURE SHALL I HELP YEAH DEFINITELY 
THE DANDELIONS ARE NOT MY FAVOURITE 
NO THEY'RE NO ONE'S FAVOURITE 
IT IS A TRICKY AREA ISN'T IT 
WITH DANDELIONS YOU'VE GOT TO GET ALL THE ROOT OUT 
A TINY BIT LEFT IN THERE AND IT'LL BE BACK 
PAT HAS JUST OVER A MONTH 
BEFORE SHE'LL BE OPENING HER GARDEN TO THE PUBLIC 
SHE'S GOT A LIST AS LONG AS HER ARM 
BEFORE OPEN DAY THERE'S STILL A LOT TO BE DONE 
THERE'S SOME MORE PELARGONIUMS TO BE PLANTED 
SOME MORE COLOURFUL PLANTS TO DOT ABOUT 
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONTAINERS BUT THEY NEED PERKING UP 
DEADHEADING TRAILING TRAINING THE CLEMATIS 
I'M A BIT WORRIED ABOUT THE WEATHER 
THINGS ARE COMING INTO FLOWER NOW THAT SHOULDN'T BE UNTIL JUNE 
AS LONG AS I KEEP DEADHEADING AND WATERING 
HOPEFULLY WE CAN KEEP ON TOP OF IT 
USUALLY JUNE IS A REALLY GOOD MONTH BUT EVERYTHING IS A MONTH EARLY 
SO FINGERS CROSSED 
BARBARA'S GOT TWO WEEKS BEFORE SHE OPENS HER GARDEN GATES 
SHE'S WORKING FURIOUSLY TO GET IT LOOKING SHIPSHAPE 
WELL THERE'S QUITE A LOT TO SORT OUT STILL IN THIS BED 
I'M GOING TO PLANT THE EUPHORBIA 
BUT THERE WILL HAVE TO BE SOME OTHER SHRUBS 
ADDED TO THIS PARTICULAR AREA 
WE'VE EXTENDED THE HERBACEOUS BORDER OUT THE FRONT 
BUT WE STILL HAVE TO TIDY IT UP AND PUT IN SOME MORE COLOUR 
JOE'S SUGGESTED A SHORT TERM SOLUTION 
WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND PUT A LOT OF THINGS IN PLACE AND GET THINGS PLANTED 
OPENING FOR THE N. G.S HAS PROVED A LOT MORE DIFFICULT THAN I THOUGHT 
TO TRY AND GET THE GARDEN TO A LEVEL A STANDARD 
THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE PUBLIC TO WALK AROUND 
IS MUCH MORE CHALLENGING THAN I REALISED 
TWO WEEKS LATER AND WE'RE STILL AT SMITHWOOD HOUSE IN SURREY 
UNFORTUNATELY THE WEATHER ISN'T IDEAL IT'S RAINING 
DESPITE THE DRIZZLE THE GARDEN IS LOOKING INCREDIBLE 
BARBARA ADDRESSED THE LACK OF COLOUR PROBLEM 
AND THE WORK SHE HAS PUT IN HAS PAID OFF 
WHAT USED TO BE A DRIED UP BED UNDER THE EUCALYPTUS 
REALLY HAS BEEN REGENERATED 
IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR VISITORS TO START TURNING UP 
I LOVE THIS GARDEN POND I WANT ONE 
I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL GARDEN 
WHICH I THINK IS ENHANCED BY THE RAIN RATHER THAN SPOILT BY IT 
BECAUSE IT'S SO GREEN AND LUSH 
IT'S GOT WONDERFUL SCULPTURES WHICH A LOT OF THEM FEATURE WATER SO I THINK IT'S GORGEOUS 
SO DESPITE THE WEATHER THE GARDEN IS BEING WELL RECEIVED 
AND GAIL IS ON HAND TO GIVE HER OPINION 
GAIL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS GARDEN 
I THINK IT'S COME ON QUITE A LOT SINCE I SAW IT INITIALLY 
AND THERE'S QUITE A LOT HERE FOR VISITORS TO ENJOY 
ARE YOU PLEASED YOU'VE ACCEPTED BARBARA INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
YES VERY PLEASED THAT SHE'S COME INTO THE BOOK 
AND I HOPE SHE'LL STAY WITH US FOR YEARS 
I HOPE IT'LL GET BIGGER AND BETTER 
BARBARA IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY YOU MUST BE TIRED 
I'M VERY TIRED 
HAS IT BEEN A GOOD DAY 
A VERY GOOD TURNOUT CONSIDERING THE WEATHER 
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE COME 
IN TOTAL ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY 
DID ANYBODY NOTICE THE AREA YOU'VE RESOLVED 
WELL A FEW FRIENDS HAVE NOTICED 
THAT I'VE TIDIED UP PARTS OF THE GARDEN THAT WERE MESSY 
I THINK IT'S BLENDED IN TO THE GARDEN AS A WHOLE 
YOU'VE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB WITH THE GARDEN 
CONSIDERING THE WEATHER IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY 
THANK YOU YEAH WE'VE ENJOYED IT 
IT'S THE END OF JUNE AND IT'S THE MORNING OF PAT'S OPEN DAY 
SHE'S OUT BRIGHT AND EARLY PUTTING UP SIGNS' 
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD 
HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE LOTS OF PEOPLE COMING 
PAT IS MOMENTS AWAY FROM OPENING HER GARDEN FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SHE'S PUT LOADS OF WORK INTO IT AND IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
I JUST HOPE LOADS OF PEOPLE TURN UP TO SEE IT 
PAT'S GARDEN IS LOOKING LUSTROUS AND HER BORDERS ARE PACKED WITH VIBRANT COLOURS 
THE GRAVEL AREA AND HER GRASSY BED HAVE CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION 
THE GARDEN IS A PHENOMENAL SUCCESS 
AND VISITORS START ARRIVING IN THEIR DROVES' 
YOU COME ROUND THE CORNER AND THERE'S JUST THIS OH 
OF COURSE YOU CAN'T SEE IT 
YOU SEE A BIT AND YOU GO ROUND THE CORNER AND THERE'S ANOTHER BIT 
WHAT WAS YOUR FAVOURITE BIT LET ME GUESS 
THE CHAIR THIS IS THE LIFE FOR ME 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF PAT'S GARDEN 
LOVELY WE'VE JUST LOOKED AND IT'S SO FULL IT'S REALLY REALLY LOVELY 
IF WE WERE SCORING POINTS THIS WOULD EASILY BE NINE OUT OF TEN 
ROSIE LLOYD THE COUNTY ORGANISER FOR EAST SUSSEX ARRIVES' 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE GARDEN WELL I'M ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED 
SHE'S DONE IT IT'S A DELIGHT THE WHOLE THING 
PLANTS EVERYWHERE FLOWERING 
INTERESTING PLANTS IT MAKES YOU STOP AND LOOK

AND RAISED NEARLY ONE THOUSAND FOR CHARITY 
SHE IS NOW A FULLY PAID UP MEMBER OF THE YELLOW BOOK FAMILY
