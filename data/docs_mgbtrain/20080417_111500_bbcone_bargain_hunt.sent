I NORMALLY SELL THESE STAMP BOXES 
FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DEPENDING ON THE DAY DEPENDING ON THE CONDITION 
WITH THE LETTERING I WOULD EXPECT IT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE 
AND ITS PRICE ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
WE SHOULD TRY AND GET A DEAL ON THAT YEAH WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO IMPROVE ON THAT 
BUT WE'RE IN PROFIT AT ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE ANY LOWER AND WE MAXIMISE OUR PROFIT

JAMES MARCHED IN AND STAMPED THE PRICE DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY

IT'S PERTAINING TO BE CROCODILE SKIN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THIS LATCH HAS BEEN PUT ON WE HAVE THE ORIGINAL LOCK ON THE BOTTOM 
IT'S NOT GONNA BE WORTH A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU WON'T GET A GREAT DEAL 
IT'S THIRTY FIVE WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO PAY TEN

WE'VE A LOT OF WORK TO DO WITH YOU 
NICE TRUNK HOPEFULLY THE MOCK CROC DOESN'T BITE BACK 
THE VICTORIANS WERE AN INCREDIBLY INVENTIVE LOT 
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THESE FAIRS IS YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING WACKY 
AND RARE AND EARLY AND MADE OF A PECULIAR MATERIAL 
ALL THOSE ELEMENTS ARE IN THIS NOVELTY WATCH CHAIN 
IT SEEMS TO BE MADE OF A SERIES OF INTERLACED LINKS WHICH IT IS 
THAT TERMINATE IN A SWEET LITTLE PADLOCK 
IF I PRESS ONE END OF THAT PADLOCK YOU CAN SEE IT COMES UNDONE 
WHAT'S IT MADE OF I'D LIKE TO THINK IT WAS MADE OF CARVED WOOD OR JET 
BUT IF YOU HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND IT'S EXTREMELY LIGHT 
IT'S NOT MADE OF WOOD OR JET 
IT'S MADE OF A MIRACLE MATERIAL THE VICTORIANS INVENTED IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTIES 
CALLED BOIS DURCI 
AND WHAT'S BOIS DURCI BOIS DURCI IS PIG'S BLOOD AND SAWDUST 
MIXED INTO A PASTE WHICH IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THIS CHAIN 
AT THE END OF EACH LINK IS A LITTLE CRACK 
AND THAT IS WHERE THE PERSON THAT MADE IT OUT OF THIS MOIST PLASTIC LIKE MATERIAL 
CLOSED EACH LINK AND JOINED IT TO THE NEXT GRADUATED LINK AND SO ON 
IT WAS THEN PUT IN AN OVEN AND IT WAS BAKED TILL IT WAS HARD 
AND YOU FINISH UP WITH A ONE OFF NOVELTY WATCH CHAIN LIKE THAT 
DO YOU LIKE IT WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT YOU HAVE TO ADMIRE VICTORIAN INVENTIVENESS

THREE TWO ONE TIME'S UP LET'S HOPE THEY HAVEN'T SPENT ALL THEIR MONEY 
JAMES AND CATHERINE WANT LOTS OF LEFTOVER LOLLY TO BUY THE BONUS BUY WHICH MAY BOOST PROFITS

CATHERINE DECANTED THIRTY FROM THE KITTY 
FOR THE FRENCH PORT DECANTER

PROBABLY CATHERINE'S ITEM BUT WE STILL PREFER OUR CLOCK 
HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND OVERALL TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY 
TWENTY ONLY WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH A MISERABLE TWENTY

SAY ANOTHER PRAYER NOW FOR THE BLUES 
THE BLUES CAUGHT THE DEVON WARE GURGLE JUG FOR FIVE 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY GUARANTEED NEXT DAY DELIVERY ON THE TUNBRIDGE WARE STAMP BOX 
AND REBECCA STIRRED THINGS UP WITH HER NINETEEN SIXTIES COCKTAIL BAR FOR SEVENTY 
WHAT A MIXTURE WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE PIECE THE BAR THE BAR 
I AGREE WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE BIGGEST PROFIT THE STAMP BOX 
HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THAT GIVES ME ONE HUNDRED FIVE CHANGE 
YES THANK YOU JAMES ONE HUNDRED FIVE THAT SOUNDS ALL RIGHT TO ME 
GOT ANYTHING IN MIND THERE ARE STILL SOME BARGAINS TO BE HAD 
WILL THEY BE AS GOOD AS YOUR STAMP BOX I DOUBT IT GOOD LUCK 
BEFORE THE AUCTION I'M OFF TO THE COUNTRYSIDE 
IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY SO MANY THOUSANDS OF TOURISTS FLOCK TO KENT 
TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THESE FAMOUS SYMMETRICAL BUILDINGS BEHIND ME 
THE OAST HOUSES KNOWN AS BELLS HERE AT THE HOP FARM 
WERE BUILT IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTIES 
AND EVERY SEPTEMBER THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WOULD DESCEND HERE TO PICK HOPS AND EARN EXTRA CASH 
ONCE THE HOPS HAD BEEN PICKED THEY WERE TAKEN TO THE OAST HOUSE 
WHERE THEY WOULD BE DRIED COOLED AND PACKED READY FOR THE BREWERIES 
THE PROCESS WOULD START HERE IN THE BOWELS OF THE OAST HOUSE 
THIS IS THE KILN THEY WOULD LIGHT A HUGE FIRE AND THE HOT AIR WOULD RISE THROUGH THAT SLATTED CEILING 
THIS SPACE IS KNOWN AS THE ROUNDEL 
IT SITS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE KILN 
AND THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE THE HOPS WOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THIS SACK CALLED A POKE 
AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SPREAD ABOUT EVENLY 
SO THAT THE MOISTURE CONTENT WHICH IN A FRESHLY PICKED HOP IS EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT MOISTURE COULD BE REDUCED 
IF YOU DIDN'T REDUCE THE MOISTURE CONTENT DOWN TO ABOUT TEN PER CENT 
THEY COULD DETERIORATE IN STORAGE 
THIS DRYING PROCESS WAS ONE MAN'S JOB AND HE WAS VERY IMPORTANT 
HE WAS CALLED THE DRIER AND HE'D BE HERE MONITORING HOW MUCH FRESH AIR YOU LET IN THROUGH THAT DUCT 
IF HE WANTED TO LET HOT AIR AND MOISTURE OUT HE'D YANK ON ROPES 
WHICH WOULD OPEN HATCHWAYS TO THE COWL ON THE TOP WHICH WOULD REVOLVE WITH THE WIND DIRECTION 
ALLOWING THE HOT AIR AND MOISTURE TO GO OUT 
ONCE THE HOPS WERE DRY THEY WERE TAKEN OUT TO BE COOLED 
THE PROBLEM WITH THESE DRY HOPS IS THEIR VERY HIGH VOLUME 
THEY'RE FULL OF AIR AND DIFFICULT TO TRANSPORT 
SO THEY USED A GADGET LIKE THIS A HOP PRESS 
THEY WOULD HAVE POURED THE DRIED HOPS THROUGH THE FLOOR AND THEN BY WINDING THIS HANDLE 
COMPRESSED THEM INTO ENORMOUS SACKS DOWN BELOW CALLED HOP POCKETS 
THOSE WOULD BE TIED UP AND THE HOPS TRANSPORTED TO THE BREWERY 
I'D LOVE TO GO TO THE BREWERY BUT WE'VE GOT SOME SERIOUS BUSINESS TO DO 
WOULD YOU DROP ME OFF AT THE CANTERBURY AUCTION ROOMS NO PROBLEM 
WE'VE TROTTED OFF TO CANTERBURY TO HORSE AROUND AT THE CANTERBURY AUCTION GALLERIES 
GUESS THERE'S NO USE IN HANGING ROUND 
GUESS I'LL GET DRESSED AND DO THE TOWN
