SUFFERED A SHATTERED PELVIS SHE GAVE A DESCRIPTION THAT MATCHED OUR GUYS 
THEY WERE DOING OVER SIXTY 
SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT ON THEM SO FAR 
THREE SMASH AND GRAB RAIDS IN HOLBY IN THE LAST FOUR NIGHTS ALL IN THE CITY CENTRE 
UPMARKET RETAILERS DESIGNER GEAR JEWELLERY AND LEATHER GOODS 
SO DECENT SECURITY NOT MUCH USE IF SOMEONE REVERSES AT FULL SPEED THROUGH YOUR WINDOW 
OUR GUYS ARRIVE ON A MOTORBIKE HOTWIRE A CAR NEAR THE TARGET AND USE IT AS A MOTORISED BATTERING RAM 
FORENSICS FOUND NOTHING WITNESS STATEMENTS CONFIRM WHAT'S ON C. C. T. V. 
THEY WEAR GLOVES AND HELMETS WITH TINTED VISORS ONE CARRIES A HAMMER UNDER HIS JACKET 
WE CAN'T TRACE THE BIKE BECAUSE THE NUMBER PLATE'S BLACKED OUT 
AFTER EACH JOB THEY DISAPPEAR 
SEEM TO KNOW EVERY BACK ROAD EVERY CUT THROUGH 
WHO ARE THESE JUST CAME IN FROM LINCOLN 
LAST MONTH A TRAFFIC COP SPOTTED A MOTORBIKE RUNNING A RED LIGHT 
GAVE CHASE THE BIKE SWERVED INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC SWERVED TO AVOID 
HEAD ON COLLISION BETWEEN THE OFFICER AND A FATHER AND SON 
THE LITTLE BOY'S STILL ON A VENTILATOR 
WE'RE SURE IT'S THE SAME BIKE ABSOLUTELY THEY HIT SALISBURY A MONTH BEFORE LINCOLN 
THE MO'S AN EXACT MATCH 
THREE OR FOUR RAIDS IN AS MANY NIGHTS LIE LOW FOR A FEW WEEKS 
MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TOWN AND START AGAIN 
IF THEY STICK TO THE PATTERN THEY'LL MOVE ANY TIME NOW 
NONE OF THE OTHER FORCES HAVE SENT OVER ANYTHING USEFUL

MUM WAS OVERJOYED WHEN HE WENT DOWN FOR BURGLARY AND ANNA DUMPED HIM 
WHEN WAS THIS FIVE YEARS AGO 
ANNA CARRIED ON WEARING THE NECKLACE EVEN AFTER SHE GOT MARRIED 
CLEARLY SHE NEVER STOPPED CARRYING A TORCH 
DOES THIS BOYFRIEND HAVE A NAME
