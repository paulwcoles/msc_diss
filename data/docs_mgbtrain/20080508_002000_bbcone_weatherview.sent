MOST OF US HAD A LOVELY DAY ON WEDNESDAY PLENTY OF SUNSHINE 
TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE AVERAGE 
TODAY THERE'S LITTLE CHANGE ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL DAY ACROSS THE U. K. 
A SUNNY BUT BREEZY DAY ONCE AGAIN 
THERE IS A BIT OF A CHANGE ON THE WAY 
DOWN TOWARDS THE FAR SOUTH AND WEST THIS CLOUD IS SLOWLY MOVING 
TOWARDS US AND IT WILL EVENTUALLY BRING RAIN TO THE ISLES OF SCILLY 
AND TOWARDS CORNWALL BUT LATE IN THE DAY ON THURSDAY 
OVERNIGHT IT'S CLEAR SKIES FOR MOST OF US 
THE MAIN EXCEPTION WILL BE THE SOUTH EAST OF SCOTLAND 
AND NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND SOME MIST FOG AND LOW CLOUD FORMING HERE 
BIT CHILLY IN THE HIGHLANDS COLD ENOUGH FOR A TOUCH OF GROUND FROST 
BUT NOT SO FURTHER SOUTH ANOTHER MILD NIGHT 
FOURTEEN IN CARDIFF TO START THE DAY AND THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE HERE 
A BEAUTIFUL START IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
TEMPERATURES IN DOUBLE FIGURES FROM EARLY ON 
SIMILAR ACROSS SCOTLAND LOTS OF SUNSHINE AROUND 
BUT THROUGH THE CENTRAL LOWLANDS EDINBURGH AREA IN PARTICULAR 
THROUGH THE FIRTH OF FORTH AND ALONG THE NORTH SEA COAST 
WE COULD SEE SOME OF THAT MORNING MIST FOG AND LOW CLOUD 
SHOULDN'T LAST TOO LONG AND IT WILL EVENTUALLY BURN ITS WAY BACK 
TOWARDS THE COAST FOR CENTRAL AND EASTERN ENGLAND 
IT'S A GLORIOUS START TO THE DAY TEMPERATURES ALREADY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN DEGREES 
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AROUND TEMPERATURES RISING QUICKLY 
BUT ALWAYS TEMPERED BY THAT EASTERLY BREEZE 
BIT OF CLOUD BEGINNING TO CREEP INTO CORNWALL 
BUT IT'S A FINE DRY START HERE 
THROUGH THE MORNING THE MIST AND FOG WILL CLEAR AWAY 
FROM THE NORTH EAST THEN IT'S FINE AND SUNNY PRETTY MUCH NATIONWIDE 
PATCHY CLOUD WILL DEVELOP IN THE NORTH WEST POSSIBLY BRINGING 
ONE OR TWO LIGHT SHOWERS BUT MOST OF US ENJOYING A LOVELY AFTERNOON 
ONCE AGAIN TEMPERATURES WELL INTO THE TWENTIES TWENTY THREE FOR BIRMINGHAM 
AND FOR MANCHESTER A LOVELY AFTERNOON 
BUT ALONG THE NORTH SEA COAST ONCE AGAIN THE BREEZE COMING IN 
ACROSS THE WATER WILL BRING A COOL FEEL TO THINGS 
MAYBE A SEVENTEEN IN ABERDEEN BUT A TWENTY THREE IN GLASGOW 
OUTSIDE CHANCE OF ONE OR TWO SHOWERS IN WESTERN SCOTLAND 
BUT NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S A LOVELY DAY 
LOVELY DAY TOO IN WALES TWENTY THREE IN CARDIFF 
AND THAT EASTERLY BREEZE CONTINUES TO BLOW HERE'S THE CLOUD THOUGH 
MOVING ITS WAY IN ACROSS CORNWALL AND DEVON 
STILL DRY INTO THE AFTERNOON 
TWENTY ONE IN SOUTHAMPTON MAYBE A TWENTY FOUR IN LONDON 
PROBABLY A TWENTY FIVE SOMEWHERE TO THE WEST OF LONDON 
BUT AGAIN THE EASTERLY WIND WILL JUST TEMPER THOSE TEMPERATURES A BIT 
NOW IT'S THURSDAY EVENING AND NIGHT WHEN THAT RAIN SPREADS IN 
ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST IT WILL TURN QUITE GREY AND MURKY 
WITH SOME HILL FOG BUT THE FURTHER EAST YOU ARE ON FRIDAY 
IT'LL BE ANOTHER LOVELY DAY PLENTY OF SUNSHINE FOR SCOTLAND 
NORTHERN AND EASTERN ENGLAND FURTHER WEST RATHER CLOUDY 
WITH SOME RAIN FOR NORTHERN IRELAND WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
COULD WELL SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE RAIN ON SATURDAY 
IN SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
BUT THAT WILL BE GONE BY SUNDAY
