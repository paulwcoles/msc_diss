WOOPS CAN THE PRIME MINISTER SNAP 
OUT OF HIS MISS FORTUNES SO FAST 
TONIGHT ON THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE 
AGAIN AT LEAST HE HOPES HE IS 
RISING AGAIN IN ONE PUBLIC 
PERFORMANCE AFTER ANOTHER THE 
PRIME MINISTER SETS TOUT SALVAGE 
HIS PARTY'S FORTUNE WHICH AFTER 
ONE LOT OF REVERSES FACES THE 
STIFFEST TEST SINCE RESUMING THE 
LEADERSHIP LEADERSHIP I AM REPORTING FROM THE CREWE AND 
NANTWICH BY ELECTION WHERE DAVID 
CAMERON AND THE CONSERVATIVES ARE 
HOPING TO RECORD THE FIRST 
CONSERVATIVE GAIN IN AL BY ELECTION 
FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
HOW WOULD 
THE MAN WHO SPAN FOR TONY BLAIR 
ADVISE HIM TO GET OUT OF HIS 
CURRENT MESS THE CHINESE DAM IS 
CRACKED BY THE EARTHQUAKE CAN THEY 
BE MADE SAFE AND WE REPORT FROM 
CONGO AS BRITISH TAXPAYERS' MONEY 
IS USED TO LAUNDER THE REPUTATION 
OF FOREIGN MINING COMPANIES THERE 
GOOD EVENING 
IN TERMS OF SURVIVAL IT IS PERHAPS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT WEEK OF GORDON 
BROWN'S POLITICAL CAREER A WEEK 
TODAY THE VOTERS OF CREWE AND 
NANTWICH WILL DELIVER JUDGMENT ON 
HIM IT IS NOT GOOD HE BELIEVES HE 
HAS PUT THE DAMAGE IN THE TEN PENCE 
TAX FEEFBGOW BY BORROWING THE BEST 
PART OF THREE BILLION BUT GORDON 
BROWN FEARS THAT THE NEXT WEEK 
COULD SEE THE FIRST CONSERVATIVE 
BY ELECTION IN A GENERATION THAT 
IS WHY HE IS IN AND OUT OF 
TELEVISION STUDIOS AND MAKING THE 
MOST OF RINGING ENDORSEMENTS FROM 
COR CORONATION STREET'S VERA 
DUCKWORTH DUCKWORTH AFTER ONE OF HIS MINISTERS 
INADVERTENTLY LET A PHOTOGRAPHER 
SNAP A CONFIDENTIAL CABINET 
BRIEFING MEMO GORDON BROWN WAS NOT 
TAKING CHANCES TODAY 
I WILL PUT THIS IN MY POCKET 
BUT IT HAS BECOME CLEAR IF WE 
COULD SEE HIS NOTES WE ARE 
WITNESSING A THREE DAY FIGHT 
BACKSTRATEGY 
ON DAY ONE HE SPOKE ABOUT THE TEN 
PENCE TAX RATE GETTING RID OF ONE 
OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS DAY TWO 
HE UNVEILED A DRAFT QUEEN'S SPEECH 
A PROGRAMME OF LEGISLATION FOR NEXT 
YEAR AND TODAY SUMMITING HIMSELF TO 
A MEDIA GRILLING 
REPORT WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO THE 
LABOUR 
WHAT IS THE MESSAGE TO 
THE LABOUR M. P.'S PLOTTING TO BRING 
YOU DOWN 
WE ARE GOING THROUGH A 
DIFFICULT ECONOMIC SITUATION BUT 
THE FIRST CONCERN IS THE COST OF 
HOUSEHOLD GOODS WHAT IS IN THE 
SHOPPING BASKET WHAT THEY HAVE TO 
PAY IN THE PETROL STATION THESE 
ARE THE EVENTS DUCE TO WORLD 
CIRCUMSTANCES YOU NEED A GOVERNMENT 
ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS AND 
ADDRESS THEM 
FIGHTING BACK IN THE 
FACE OF THE BAD HEADLINES IS 
DIFFICULT BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE 
OTHERS HAVE MANAGED IT 
THERE IS NO PROBLEM IN PRINCIPLE 
ABOUT PRIME MINISTER 
POLITICIAN GOING THROUGH A ROUGH 
PATCH AND PURLING OUT OF IT 
THROUGH IT AND GOING ON TO WIN 
THATCHER CERTAINLY DID IT IS 
EASILY DONE IF YOU HAVE THE 
LEADERSHIP SKILLS IF YOU HAVE THE 
CHARACTER IF YOU HAVE THE LUCK 
GORDON BROWN'S CHARACTER SEEMS TO 
BE WRONG THE LEADERSHIP SKILLS 
DON'T SEEM TO BE THERE AND THE 
LUCK SEEMS TO ARE RUN OUT HE IS 
CLOSE NOW I THINK TO THE BRITISH 
PUBLIC FORMING AN OPINION ABOUT HIM 
WHICH ONCE FORMED WILL BE HARD TO 
SHIFT SHIFT JOHN MAJOR MANAGED TO COME BACK 
FROM A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION AND 
WIN THE NINETEEN NINETY TWO ELECTION DAVID HILL 
REPLACED ALASTAIR CAMPBELL AT 
NUMBER TEN BUT IN NINETY TWO WAS HEAD OF 
PRESS FOR THE DEFEATED LABOUR PARTY 
HE SAY THERE IS ARE LESSONS FOR 
GORDON BROWN 
THE GENERAL PUBLIC LOOKED CAREFULLY 
AND SAID DO WE FEEL WE WANT 
TRUST THE ENCOME BENT OR TAKE THE 
RISK IS THE RISK WORTH TAKING 
THEY SAID NO THAT IS THE LESSON 
FOR THOSE COMMENTING AT THE MOMENT 
IF GORDON BROWN CAN RECREATE THE 
SENSE OF CONVICTION AND DIRECTION 
PEOPLE WILL SAY THE SAME THING 
ABOUT HIM AT THE NEXT ELECTION AS 
WAS SAID ABOUT JOHN MAJOR IN NINETY TWO 
GORDON BROWN HAS ATTEMPTED TO 
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF DAMAGING 
HEADLINES THE PRESS TEAM ARE NOW 
APPARENTLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE HE 
IS NOT PHOTOGRAPHED IN ANY 
EMBARRASSING SITUATION BUT EVEN 
THE MOST DILIGENT MEDIA HANDLER 
CANNOT PREVENT THE ODD BUM PHOTO 
BUT THE PRIME MINISTER IS BEGINNING 
TO SMILE MORE THAN AS HE DID AS THE 
CHANCELLOR SOME BELIEVE IT IS 
NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH TO ELIMINATE 
THE NEGATIVES 
YOU MUST BE HEARD TALKING BIG 
THINGS TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT NEW 
MOMENTUM YOU ARE ASKING TO BE RE 
ELECTED FOR A FOURTH TERM THE 
PRESS CONFERENCE I COULD NOT THINK 
OF ANYTHING OF SUBSTANCE COMING OUT 
TO GIVE A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
MOMENTUM I WAS TAKING NOTES 
THEREFORE OUT THERE THERE WILL BE 
NO SENSE OF WHAT THIS IS ABOUT 
WHAT HE IS ABOUT 
I THINK THAT HE 
KNOWS WHERE HE WANTS TO GO AND WHY 
BUT IS NOT YET FULLING YORKED OUT 
HOW TO EXPRESS IT L. DON'T THINK HE 
IS PROPERLY ALIGHTED ON THE KEY 
POLICIES THAT HE MUST PURSUE IN 
ORDER TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE 
RECOGNISE THAT HE HAS A SENSE OF 
DIRECTION AND GOT CONVICTION 
ONE OF GORDON BROWN'S PROBLEMS IS 
THAT SOME OF HIS M. P.'S THINK THAT 
OTHERS IN THE PARTY COULD DO A MUCH 
BETTER JOB AS THE LEADER THAT IS 
SOMETHING THAT JOHN MAJOR HAD TO 
FACE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
WHEN JOHN MAJOR WAS 
FACING DIFFICULTIES OUTSIDE OF HIS 
GOVERNMENT AND DIVISIONS INSIDE HE 
TOLD THE CRITICS IT WAS TIME TO PUT 
UP OR SHOUT UP AND RESUBMITTED 
HIMSELF TO A LEADERSHIP CONTEST 
WAS HE WRONG TO DO THAT 
WELL I 
THINK I WAS ELECTED UNOPPOSED L. THINK THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT 
WE ARE GETTING ON WITH THE JOB L. 
WILL NOT BE DISTRACTED BY THIS 
GOSSIP GOSSIP OF COURSE ALL PRIME MINISTERS 
PRIME MINISTERSHIPS ENDS SOME 
AFTER A LONG TIME SOME AFTER ONLY 
A BRIEF STAY THERE ARE PROBLEMS ON 
THE HORIZON FOR GORDON BROWN THE 
BY ELECTION AND PROPOSALS TO 
EXTEND PRE CHARGE DETENTION FOR 
TERROR SUSPECTS FOR A START IF 
THAT GOES BADLY IF THE FIGHT BACK 
DOES NOT SEEM TO WORK GORDON BROWN 
MAY BE HEADING FOR THE EXIT QUICKER 
THE FOCUS ON THE INTENSE BURST OF 
ACTIVITY TO GET BACK ON THE FRONT 
FOOT IS THE CREWE AND NANTWICH BY 
ELECTION NOT LONG AGO LABOUR 
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD THE 
SEAT WE SENT MICHAEL THERE TO MAKE 
A NUISANCE OF HIMSELF 
SPRINGTIME IN NANTWICH 
BY ELECTIONS ARE RARE THESE DAYS 
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SINCE 
LABOUR CAME TO POWER 
A CONTEST WHICH MAY SHOW WHETHER 
LABOUR'S DAYS ARE NOW NUMBERED AND 
THE TORIES ARE BACK IN BUSINESS 
IT IS SO KEENLY FOUGHT THAT WHAT 
THE LABOUR CANDIDATES SPOKE TO THE 
PRESS TODAY ONE PARTY OFFICIAL 
TRIED TO BLOCK EVEN THE NAME OF 
THEIR TORY CHALLENGER 
YOU DON'T WANT THAT SHOT MICHAEL MICHAEL PLEASE 
TAMSIN DONEWOODY IS PLEASE DAUGHTER OF THE LATE M. P. HERE 
GWYNETH DUNWOODY ALTHOUGH WHEN THE 
SLIMMER VERSION SAT IN THE WELSH 
SHE PREFERRED THE DOUBLE BARRELED 
NAME FOR SOME REASON 
LABOUR HOPES THAT THE SHORTER NAME 
WILL DO THE TRICK 
ARE YOU GWYNETH'S DAUGHTER YES 
NICE TO MEET YOU USED TO CHAT 
WITH HER 
THE LIB DEM LEADER NICK CLEGG WAS 
WITH HIS FEMALE CANDIDATE IN THE 
TOWN OF CREWE FOUR MILES EAST 
TOURING THE RAILWAY WORKS THERE 
BIRTHPLACE TO THOUSANDS OF LOKOWS 
ONCE PARADISE TO THOUSANDS OF 
SCHOOL BOYS 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE BEEN 
HERE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY P. W. H. I WAS A TWELVE YEAR 
OLD TRAIN SPOTTER TODAY IT IS NOT 
SO MUCH THE TRAIN SPOTTERS AS THE 
NUMBERS NEXT THURSDAY POLLS 
SUGGEST THAT THE NUMBERS ARE NOT 
LOOKING GOOD FOR ELISABETH SHENTON 
SHE WAS CHOSEN WHEN THE LIB DEM 
HIGH COMMAND STOPPED THE LOCAL MAN 
FROM FIGHTING THIS BY ELECTION ODD 
REALLY FOR A PARTY PLEDGED TO DE 
CENTRALISATION CENTRALISATION WAS IT NOT VICIOUS TO KNIFE YOUR 
PREVIOUS CANDIDATE MR. GOD WIN 
THAT IS NOT HOW IT HAPPENED 
ELISABETH WAS THE CHOICE FOR THE 
PARTY AND THE LOCAL PARTY TOO 
WISHES TO HAVE HER STAND 
BUT YOU AND YOUR HENCHMEN WOULD NOT 
EVEN DECIDE TO CHOOSE MR. GOD WIN 
EVEN THOUGH HE HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS A 
PARTY CANDIDATE 
ELIZABETH HAS BEEN 
CHOSEN AS THE CANDIDATE 
EVERY CANDIDATE SAYS THEY ARE 
INDEPENDENTLY MINDED LIKE GWYNETH 
DUNWOODY BUT SHE WAS EURO 
SCEPTIC HAPPY TO DEFY THE WHIPS 
WOULD YOU DEFY NICK CLEGG ON THE 
REFERENDUM 
I THINK IT WILL BE MY REFERENDUM POSITION WHEN I TAKE MY PLACE YOU YOU HAVE NOT WORKED IT OUT YET THE 
CONSERVATIVE AND THE FAVOURITE TO 
WIN IS EDWARD TIFRPLSON HE IS A 
BARRISTER WHOSE FAMILY OWNS A CHAIN 
OF SHOE REPAIR SHOPS LABOUR MOCK 
HIM AS ANOTHER RICH TORY TO HAVE 
TODAY DAVID CAMERON PAID HIS THIRD 
VISIT HERE BOARDING A FREIGHT LOKO 
THOUGH OMINOUSLY PERHAPS IT WENT 
NOWHERE WHILST HE WAS AT THE 
CONTROLS CONTROLS WOULD YOU HOPE THAT MR. TIMPSON IS 
AS INDEPENDENT MINDED AS GWYNETH 
DUNWOODY WAS 
I HAVE A LOT OF 
INDEPENDENT MINDED M. P.'S IN MY PARTY 
ARE YOU HAPPY FOR HIM TO REBEL 
OBVIOUSLY I LEAD MY PARTY I LIKE 
MY MEMBERS TO SUPPORT ME BUT THEY 
HAVE TO PUT THEIR CONSCIOUS THIRD 
THE CONSTITUENCY SECOND AND THE 
PARTY THIRD THAT IS THE WAY THAT I 
BEHAVE THAT IS THE WAY THAT OTHERS 
BEHAVE YOU CAN SEE MY TEAM COMING 
TOGETHER BUT IN THE END THE MEMBER 
OF THE PARLIAMENT U. MUST DO WHAT IS 
RIGHT FOR HIS OR HER CONSTITUENTS 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO REBEL 
GRAMMAR SCHOOL 
BACK IN NANTWICH THE FORMER HEALTH 
SECRETARY HIMSELF A SOFT CONFESSED 
CLASS WARRIOR FRANK DOBSON 
DEFENDED LABOUR'S JIBES AGAINST 
TIMPSON THIS IS THE WAY TO 
CAMPAIGN MOCKING THE CONSERVATIVE 
CANDIDATE AS A TORY BOY WITH 
PICTURE OF WHAT IS DESCRIBED AS HIS 
MANSION HOUSE 
WELL IT IS A MANSION 
THAT MANSION THAT IS NOTHING 
COMPARED TO WHAT TONY BLAIR IS 
BUYING 
I AM NOT LONGER RESPONSIBLE BUYING FOR TONY BLAIR NOR DO I HAVE TO 
DEFEND HIM 
SO POLITICIANS CAN'T HAVE LET'S LET'S GET THIS HE IS A TORY I BELIEVE 
HE WENT TO ETON DIDN'T T. HE 
UPPING HAM ACTUALLY 
HE IS A TO 
HAVE HE HAS LOTS OF MONEY WE ARE 
DRAWING IT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE 
PEOPLE OF CREWE AND QUITE RIGHTLY 
TALKING TO THE VOTERS IT IS CLEAR 
THAT THE TEN PENCE TAX ROW IS STILL 
HURTING DESPITE THE CONCESSIONS 
MANY ARE STILL LEAVING LABOUR 
EVERYTHING THAT THEY TOUCH GOES 
WRONG THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
WHAT ABOUT THE CONSEING SESSIONS 
MADE BY THE CHANCELLOR 
CONCESSIONS MADE BY THE CHANCELLOR 
IT IS NOT ENOUGH IT IS NOT HELPING 
THE POOREST PEOPLE 
I AM VOTING 
CONSERVATIVE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
YEARS YEARS WHY 
BOWS I DON'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY WHY SAY ABOUT THE TEN PENCE TAX AREA AREA NOT THIS TIME 
I WORK FOR THE N. H. S. 
I AM SHOCKED BY THE WASTE OF MONEY 
IN MIDDLE MANAGEMENT 
ALWAYS BEEN A SOCIALIST 
THIS TIME 
ALWAYS VOTED LABOUR 
I AM CHANGING MY MIND NOW 
I WILL BE SURPRISED IF LABOUR HOLDS 
ON TO THIS SEAT AS FOR THE 
POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS IT DEPENDS 
ON HOW BADLY THEY USE THERE ARE 
TEN CANDIDATES FIGHTING THE CREWE 
AND NANTWICH BY ELECTION 
TEN CANDIDATES FIGHTING THE CREWE AND NANTWICH BY ELECTION 
I THINK WHAT HE DID HE IS A 
PERFECTLY GOOD COMMUNICATOR 
TONY BLAIR WAS BRILLIANT COMMUNICATOR TONY BLAIR WAS AN COMMUNICATOR EXCEPTIONAL COMMUNICATOR BILL 
CLINTON IS EXCEPTIONAL GORDON 
BROWN IS PERFECTLY GOOD FAR MORE 
IMPORTANT DID HE GO TO THIS RADIO 
STATION THAT RADIO STATION IT IS 
WHAT YOU DO WITH THE POWER THAT YOU 
HAVE GO GO L. THINK WHEN THE 
EXAMPLE OF THE DRAFT QUEEN'S SPEECH 
IS RELEVANT THAT IS WHERE THE 
GOVERNMENT MUST FOCUS 
HE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE 
ECONOMY THAT IS IMPORTANT 
WE HAD ALL SORTS OF THIS PRIS M. 
IS FORMING THAT TONY BLAIR'S DECADE 
IN POWER WAS PLAIN SAILING 
STRAIGHTFORWARD 
HE WAS NEVER STRAIGHTFORWARD GETTING THE APPROVAL RATES THAT 
GORDON BROWN WAS GETTING OCCASIONS OCCASIONS WHERE PEOPLE LIKE ME CAME ON THE 
PROGRAMMES CLIEK THIS TO SAY IF 
THIS WAS HIS WORST WEEK OR BEST 
WEEK 
I REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE A 
LABOUR SUPPORTER WHEN WE WERE 
LOSING WE HAVE TO RE FIND 
REDISCOVER SOME OF THE FIGHT 
FOCUS DISCIPLINE AND DEFENDING THE 
RECORD BETTER 
TAKE US INTO THE BIG 
QUESTION WHICH IS WHETHER THERE IS 
SOMETHING PRO FOUND SOMETHING THAT 
COULD HAPPEN IN THE DYING DAYS OF 
THE LAST CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT 
IT WAS A LONG SLOW PROCESS 
IT WAS SLOW BUT IRTEL AVIVABLE 
THERE COMES A POINT WHATEVER YOU 
DO YOU CANNOT GET IT BACK 
THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE THIS IS 
WHY I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WE BY 
THIS STAGE OF TONY BLAIR'S 
LEADERSHIP HAD DON A LOT OF HAD 
DON A LOT MORE THAN DAVID CAMERON 
HAS DONE IT IS AS IF LABOUR HAS 
BEEN THE ONLY SHOW IN TOWN FOR SO 
LONG THERE IS LITTLE PRESSURE PUT 
UPON THE CONSERVATIVES TO SPELL OUT 
REAL POLICIES PROGRAMMES IT IS UP 
TO THE LABOUR PARTY TO START 
PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON GET IT 
BACK TO BEING A REAL SENSE OF A 
DEBATE BETWEEN COMPETING LEADERS 
PARTIES PHILOSOPHIES AND POLICIES 
THAT IS WHAT I FEEL IS MISSING 
LET'S BROADEN IT OUT IS THE POST 
BIN ERA OUT JOINING US IS SHEILA 
GUNN WHO WORKED ON JOHN MAJOR SHE 
WAS HIS POLITICAL SUPPRESS PRESS 
SECRETARY IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND ANDREW 
RAWNSLEY OF THE OBSERVER YOU WERE 
THERE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS DO YOU 
REMIND YOU OF ANYTHING 
I FEW 
REMIND YOU OF ANYTHING I FEW MONTHS AGO I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT NO 
THERE WAS NOT THAT MUCH OF A 
COMPARISON WE LIKE OUR PRIME 
MINISTERS RESPECT THEM AND TRUST 
THEM WITH GORDON BROWN YOU CANNOT 
SAY ANY OF THOSE THINGS TO LOSE 
ALL THREE QUALITIES IS AMAZING IN 
SUCH A SHORT SPACE OF TIME THE THE THREE THINGS HE HAS LOST ARE 
RESPECT 
TRUST AND TO LIKE SOMEONE RESPECT YOU CANNOT COW CAN GET AWAY WITH 
BEING THE PRIME MINISTER AND NOT 
BEING LIKED VERY MUCH LIKE 
MARGARET THATCHER BUT THERE IS 
SOMETHING ABOUT GORDON BROWN THAT 
JUST SEEMS TO ALMOST SCARE PEOPLE 
WE CAN NO MORE SCIENTIFICALLY HAVE 
A PROBLEM THERE WAS FIVE THOUSAND VOTE 
OVER THE WEEKEND ON WEBSITE THAT 
SHOWED THAT ONLY ONE IN FIVE VOTERS 
THINK THAT HE IS DOING GOOD JOB 
AS THE PRIME MINISTER MORE 
WORRYING FOR THE LABOUR M. P.'S ON 
EVERY KEY LEADERSHIP INDICATOR DO 
YOU THINK HE IS FAIR CARING NEW 
MODERN FORWARD LOOKING HE IS NOW 
BEATEN BY DAVID CAMERON IF I WERE 
A LABOUR M. P.'S I WOULD BE FRIGHTENED 
BY MOST OF ALL BY THE WORD MOST 
POPULARLY USED WHICH WAS WEAK AND 
INDECISIVE INDECISIVE IF YOU WERE DOING WHAT YOU WERE 
DOING PREVIOUSLY FOR TONY BLAIR 
WHAT WOULD YOU BE TELLING HIM TO 
DO 
WELL IT IS ALL ABOUT IT IS DO NOT ABOUT THE MEDIA BUT ABOUT THE 
BIG STRATEGIC DECISIONS YOU TAKE 
AND ABOUT FORCING THE DEBATE SO IT 
BECOMES A CONTEST WHEN THEY SAY 
THEY ARE COMPARING TO CAMERON THEY 
DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT DAVID 
CAMERON HE FLITS AROUND LIKE A 
BUTTER FLY HE LOOKS PRETTY 
BUT THEY DON'T LIKE THE PRIME 
MINISTER 
BUT I AM SAYING WHAT THE MINISTER LABOUR PARTY MUST DO BETWEEN NOW 
AND THE GENERAL ELECTION IS TO GET 
THE DEBATE FOCUSED BETTER THAN IT 
IS NOW SO THAT PEOPLE START TO SEE 
IT IS NOT A REFERENDUM ON GORDON 
BROWN BUT A CHOICE BETWEEN GORDON 
BROWN AND DAVID CAMERON AS THE 
PRIME MINISTER YOU LOOK AT THE 
FIGURES THAT IS WHERE THEY ARE 
THEY CAN BE CHANGED 
DO YOU BELIEVE HE CAN RECOVER NO NO I DON'T L. FEEL SORRY FOR THE MAN 
IF HE HAD BEEN THE PRIME MINISTER 
IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN HE COULD HAVE BEEN 
SUCCESSFUL FOR A TERM BUT THE 
TIMING IS WRONG FOR HIM L. THINK 
THE FACT HE HAS BEEN HUNGERING FOR 
THE JOB YEARNING FOR IT FOR TEN 
YEARS HAS EATEN INTO HIM SOMEHOW 
IT SEEMS TO COMMUNICATE THAT HE IS 
NOT HAPPY IN THE JOB 
HE'S GOT TWO YEARS BEFORE HE HAS TO 
HAVE GENERAL ECTION LOOK AT 
THE WAY HE HAS GONE FROM LAST 
SUMMER UNTIL NOW WHAT HE HAS TO 
FIND A WAY OF DOING IS REPLICATING 
THE REASONS PEOPLE LIKED HIM IN HIS 
EARLY PERIOD WHEN THEY THOUGHT HE 
WAS COMPETENT DECISIVE AND 
APPEARED TO BE IN CHARGE WHEN HE 
RESPONDED TO THE TERROR ATTACKS L. 
THINK IT WOULD BE FATAL IF WHAT WAS 
SUPPOSED TO BE THE CORE OF THE 
GORDON BROWN OFFER THAT I AM THIS 
RELIABLE COMPETENT I MAY NOT BE 
FLASHY BUT YOU CAN RELY ON ME IF 
HE LOSES THAT THE BRAND IS BUST 
IT IS NOT HELPING THAT CHERIE BLAIR 
IS PRODUCING UNFLATTERING MEMOIRS 
WELL THERE YOU GO DO NOT THINK 
THAT WILL BE THE DECISIVE FACTOR ONE I WONDER WHETHER THAT WILL HELP HIM 
THE ONE THING PEOPLE DO THINK IS 
THAT HE IS A SERIOUS FIGURE HIS 
MEMOIRS WILL NOT BE ABOUT HIS 
WIFE'S CONTRACEPTIVE EQUIPMENT 
THEY WILL NOT BE ABOUT THE NUMBER 
OF TRIFLES HE HAS EATEN 
THEY WILL 
BE MORE LIKE OUR BOOKS 
WHAT IS 
YOUR GUT SENSE OF WHAT IS REALLY 
HAPPENING HERE IS IT A TEMPORARY 
THING 
NOT NECESSARILY L. DON'T THING THINK ANY OF US KNOW IN THE SPACE 
OF LESS THAN A YEAR HE HAS GONE 
FROM HERO TO SUB ZERO AND MAYBE HE 
CAN REVERSE THAT 
I WOULD NOT BE 
CAN REVERSE THAT SURPRISED IF GORDON BROWN HAS SOME 
WEEKS THAT BETTER THAN OTHERS 
AND IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE THINGS ARE 
LOOKING BETTER FOR GORDON BROWN 
BUT THE WRITING IS ON THE WALL I I THINK PEOPLE HAVE TO STOP WORRYING 
ABOUT WHAT THE PAPERS ARE SAYING 
DAY TODAY IT IS ABOUT TAKING THE 
BIG DECISIONS THE BIG CHALLENGES 
FACING THE COUNTRY THAT IS WHAT HE 
IS GOOD AT AND FOCUSING ON 
THERE 
THERE IS NOW INTENSE INTEREST ON THE 
STATE OF THE NUMBER OF DAMS WHICH 
WERE DAMAGED BY THE TREMORS 
ASTONISHING BUT PEOPLE ARE STILL 
BEING FOUND ALIVE IN TINY HOLES IN 
COLLAPSED RUINS IN CHINA 
DEVASTATED BY MONDAY'S MASSIVE 
EARTHQUAKE NOW THERE ARE OTHER 
THREATS LANDSLIDES ON A MASSIVE 
SCALE HAVE TURNED THE GREEN 
MOUNTAINSIDE'S BROWN THERE ARE 
POTENTIAL DISASTERS IN WAITING 
DISASTERS IN WAITING HUNDREDS OF 
DAMS HOW BADLY DAMAGED ARE YET TO 
BECOME CLEAR THE GOVERNMENT SENT 
TROOPS NOT FAR FROM DUJIANGYAN THE 
CITY WORST HIT THE ZIPINGKU DAM 
IT'S HUGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY METRES HIGH IT 
HOLDS A BILLION CUBIC METRES OF 
WATER NOT QUITE AS BIG AS THE 
GIANT HOVER DAM IN THE U. S. BUT CLOSE 
THE OFFICIAL FIGURE IS THAT THE 
EARTHQUAKE HAS DAMAGED THREE NINETY ONE D. A M. S. 
ANOTHER LARGE ONE LIKE THIS PLUS 
TWENTY EIGHT MEDIUM SIZED AND THE REST SMALL 
THE AUTHORITIES WERE SOUNDING 
CONFIDENT TODAY EVEN PREPARED TO 
GUARANTEE THAT DAMAGE TO THE 
ZIPINGKU DAM POSE NO THREAT TO 
DUJIANGYAN EXPERTS SUCH AND ANDY 
HUGHES SAYS THERE IS NO ROOM FOR 
COMPLACENCY 
THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE COMPLACENCY GUARANTEE OF COURSE THE CHINESE 
CERTAINLY OVER THE LAST FEW 
HAVE BEEN ATTENDING OUR 
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES A LOT 
MORE GETTING A LOT MORE KNOWLEDGE 
THEY ARE EXNERT THEIR OWN RIGHT 
THEY FACE THE SAME PROBLEMS WE DO 
IN THE U. K. WITH A STOCK OF DAMS THAT 
POSE A WIDE RANGE OF AGES AND TYPES 
OF DAMS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO 
LOOK AT ALL OF THEM IN THE AREA 
AFFECTED BY THIS EARTHQUAKE THEY 
WILL HAVE TO GO AROUND AND HAVE A 
LOOK AT THEM AND MAKE SURE THAT 
THEY HAVE HAVEN'T BEEN DAMNED IN 
ANY CATASTROPHIC WAY THE THE EARTHQUAKE ZONE IN SICHUAN PROVINCE 
INCLUDES HUNDREDS OF DAMS IT IS A 
MAGNET FOR PROJECTS HOPING TO 
PROFIT FROM CHINA'S THIRST FROM 
ENERGY THE ZIPINGKU DAM IS THREE 
MILES UP STREAM OF THE CITY OF 
DUJIANGYAN HOME TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
AND SUFFERING AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF 
SEVERAL SCHOOLS IT IS A MODERN DAM 
EXPERTS SAY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
BUILT TO STANDARDS OF PROTECTION 
AGAINST QUAKES THE SIZE OF MONDAY'S 
ALL THE LINES HERE ARE FLEXIBLE 
JOINTS BETWEEN THESE VARIOUS BITS 
OF CONCRETE WHICH ARE ACTING AS AN 
EXSTERPBLAL CLAG IF YOU LOOK AT 
THE SIZE OF THESE TRUCKS THEY GIVE 
A SENSE OF SCALE CAN YOU SEE THERE 
IS BUCKLING HERE ON THE PLATE AND 
DISRUPTION DOWN THROUGH ON THAT 
JOINT 
DOES THE DAMAGE TO THE JOINT SURFACE WHICH THEY ARE CLEARLY 
INSPECTING DOES IT TELL YOU MUCH 
ABOUT THE DAMAGE INSIDE TO THE ROCK 
FILLING OF THE DAM 
IT WILL GIVE A 
LOT OF INDICATION BUT OF COURSE 
THE ROCK INTERIOR HAS SOME 
FLEXIBILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT THAT 
PERHAPS THE CONCRETE ITSELF DOESN'T 
JUST BECAUSE THERE IS CRACKING AND 
SPAULING ALONG HERE ON THE JOINT 
BETWEEN THE PLATES DOESN'T 
NECESSARILY MEAN THERE IS DAMAGE 
INSIDE THE DAM BECAUSE THERE IS 
MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE BITS OF FILL 
THEY HAVE VERY LEASED THE WATER 
FROM BEHIND THE DAM AND SAY IT'S 
SAFE THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S SAFE 
TO LET THE WATER BUILD UP AGAIN 
THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
SAFETY OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES IN THE 
REGION FEW HARD FACTS OFFICIALS 
SAY THERE IS ARE NO CIVILIAN REACTS 
WITHIN ONE THOUSAND KILOMETERS OF THE 
EARTHQUAKE ZONE THAT IS NOT QUITE 
THE WHOLE STORY CHINA'S NUCLEAR 
POWER INSTITUTE IS LOCATED IN 
CHENGDU THE CAPITAL CITY OF SICHUAN 
IT INCLUDE AS NEWSPAPER OF RESEARCH 
REACTORS THERE ARE TWO CITIES 
WITHIN THE EARTHQUAKE ZONE GANG 
YANG AND MANAGE YANG HOME TO KEY 
PARTS OF CHINA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
DESIGN PROGRAMME PEOPLE ARE 
BEGINNING TO ASK IF POLITICS AND 
CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES HAVE CUT 
CORNERS AS IMAGES OF THE DAY THAT 
SHOOK THIS ONCE SECRETIVE COUNTRY 
STREAM OUT TELL OF THE COMBINED 
EFFECT OF NATURE'S FORCES AND MAN'S 
FOLLY A TRAIL OF HUMAN SUFFERING 
THERE IS STARK CONTRAST BETWEEN 
HOW THE AUTHORITIES IN CHINA AND 
BURMA HAVE RESPONDED TO THE 
INTERNAL DISASTERS THAT HAVE STRUCK 
BOTH COUNTRIES IS IT POSSIBLE THEY 
ARE USING THE SHOCK AND CHAOS OF 
THESE RECIPURES TO EXPLOIT FURTHER 
THEIR OWN PEOPLE THAT IS THE 
ARGUMENT PUT FORWARD BY NAOMI KLEIN 
JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR OF THE SHOCK 
DOCTRINE SHE JOINS FRUS TORONTO 
WHAT DO YOU THINK MAY BE GOING ON 
AS CONSEQUENCE OF THESE NATURAL 
DISASTERS NAOMI KLEIN 
WELL WHAT 
WE SEE IN AFTER THESE HUGE 
NATURAL DISASTERS IS THE STATUS QUO 
BUT MUCH MORE SO IN BOTH CHINA AND 
BURMA YOU HAVE REGIMES THAT ARE 
FAIRLY CHARACTERISED AS CRONY 
CAPITALIST REGIMES REGIMES WHERE 
THE GOVERNMENT TENDS TO GIVE 
LUCRATIVE CONTRACTS TO POLITICALLY 
CONNECTED FIRMS THIS IS HAPPENING 
IN BURMA IN THE WAKE OF THE 
DISASTER IN FACT THE DISASTER IS 
ONGOING WE 
NEWS ACTUALLY 
THAT POLITICALLY CONNECTED FIRM 
CALLED THE TOUR TRADING COMPANY 
THAT BUILT THE NEW CAPITAL IN BURMA 
HAS GOTTEN CONTRACTS TO REBUILD 
SCHOOLS WHICH IS SHOCKING THEY 
HAVEN'T COME UP WITH EMERGENCY 
SHELTERS OR WATER OR FOOD FORT 
PEOPLE BUT THEY ARE HANDING OUT 
THESE CONTRACTS THIS IS KIND OF 
WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE THIS IS 
BURMA'S HALLABURTON THEY ARE 
GETTING THE CONTRACTS THE BURMESE 
REGIME IS USING THE CHAOS TO PUSH 
THROUGH THEIR REFERENDUM WHICH IS 
A. R. UNPOPULAR REFERENDUM THAT LOCKS 
IN THEIR POWER EVEN AFTER ELECTIONS 
IN BURMA 
THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN 
ANY WAY THE REFERENDUM WAS GOING 
TO HAPPEN ANY WAY YEAH 
THEY WOULD YEAH HAVE WON IT ANY WAY THEY THEY ABSOLUTELY WOULD HAVE WON IT ANY 
WAY BUT THEY ARE USING THE 
DISASTER IN INCREDIBLY CYNICAL WAYS 
I WAS TALKING TO ONE OF BURMA'S 
MOST PROMINENT PRO DEMOCRACY 
ACTIVISTS HE WAS TELLING ME WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IN THE CYCLONE AFFECTED 
AREAS WHO PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST 
THEIR ROOFS WILL GET SCARCE 
BUILDING SUPPLIES WHICH THEY HAVE 
TO PAY FOR ON THE BLACK MARKET 
THEY ARE TOLD THEY ARE GET ONLY GET 
THE SUPPLIES IF THEY STPHROT A PRE 
BALLOT IN THE CYCLONE AFFECTED 
AREA THEY HAVE DELAYED THE 
REFERENDUM FOR TWO WEEKS IT IS 
HAPPENING ON MAY TWENTY FOURTH THEY ARE 
EXTORTING VOTES IN EXCHANGE FOR 
REBUILDING SUPPLIES AS I SAID AT 
THE START IT IS THE STATUS QUO BUT 
MORE SO AFTER THESE DISASTERS WHAT 
YOU DO IN TERMS OF WHAT I'M 
DESCRIBING DISASTER CAPITALISM YOU 
LOOK AT WHAT THE AGENDA WAS BEFORE 
THE DISASTER SOME OF THE THINGS HE 
WERE ABLE TO DO SOME OF THE THINGS 
THEY WEREN'T TIEBL DO YOU CAN SEE 
HOW THIS ABGCEL RATES UNLESS THERE 
IS A PROCESS TO STOP IT 
THE PEOPLE 
WHO SAY THAT SOMETIMES NATURAL 
DISASTERS MAY PER SIP TATE 
POLITICAL CHANGE THE EXAMPLE THAT 
IS CITED IS EAST AND WEST PAKISTAN 
THEY ARE JUST BEING UNDO YOULY 
OPTIMISTIC IN OURJUDGEMENT 
I KNOW 
I DON'T THINK SO DISASTERS ARE 
POLITICALLY VOLATILE MOMENTS THEY 
CAN GO EITHER WAY THE BURMESE 
REGIME ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY 
HAVE BEEN SO STAUNCH IN THEIR 
REFUSAL TO ALLOW FOREIGNERS INTO 
THE COUNTRY IS BECAUSE THEY ARE 
AFRAID OF RESISTANCE SPREADING IN 
THE COUNTRY THEY ARE ALSO AFRAID 
OF A MUTINY WITHIN THEIR OWN RANKS 
WITHIN THE MILITARY THAT IS PART 
OF THE REASON THE THEORY IS THAT 
THEY ARE ACTUALLY NOT DISTRIBUTING 
THE AID TO THE PEOPLE BUT 
DISTRIBUTING IT TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE 
TO HAIR THEIR SOLDIERS SO THEY 
WON'T FACE A MUTINY ANYTHING CAN 
HAPPEN IN A DISASTER ANOTHER 
FAMOUS CASE MEX KOS NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THIS IS 
A CASE WORTH REMEMBERING WHEN THERE 
WAS A TERRIBLE EARTHQUAKE IN MEXICO 
CITY BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT THE 
WHOLE CITY EQUALLY THE PUBLIC 
HOUSING COLLAPSED IN MEXICO CITY 
RIGHT NEXT TO BUILDINGS THAT WERE 
PRIVATELY OWNED OR GOVERNMENT 
BUILDINGS THAT STOOD WHAT THE 
EARTHQUAKE SHOWED WAS THAT IN THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF THE PUBLIC HOUSING 
FRBL THE HOUSING FOR POOR PEOPLE 
CORNERS WERE CUT SOMETHING PEOPLE 
SUSPECTED ANY WAY IT BROUGHT OUT 
THESE ISSUES AROUND CORRUPTION 
BRIBE TAKING AND LACK OF RESPECT 
FOR PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT GAVE BIRTH 
TO PEWERFUL PRO DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT 
IN MEXICO THESE ARE VOLATILE 
MOMENTS DISASTERS CAN BE USED BY 
THE EXISTING POWERS THEY CAN BE 
USED BY COUNTER POWERS STKPHRFPLT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME WHAT 
SHOULD WE MAKE OF THE MINING

REPORT NOW FROM THE CONGO 
THE CHOROGRAPHY IS TIMELESS THE 
LYRICS ARE ALWAYS ADAPTABLE IN 
CONDITION GALEES VILLAGES LIKE THIS 
WOMEN HAVE TURNED OUT FOR CENTURIES 
TO PRAISE KINGS WARLORDS OR 
POLITICAL PARTIES TODAY THEY WANT 
TO THANK AN AUSTRALIAN COOPER 
MINING COMPANY ANVIL AND AN 
AMERICAN CHARITY SPECIALISING IN 
BUSINESS LED DEVELOPMENT WHAT WERE 
YOU THINKING ABOUT 
WE ARE SINGING ABOUT OUR DREAMS COMING TRUE WE HAVE 
SEEN ALL THE CHANGE THAT HAS 
HAPPENED IN THE VILLAGE WATER TO 
DRINK FARMING ACTIVITIES THIS 
BEAUTIFUL SCHOOL THAT IS WHAT WE 
ARE SINGING ABOUT ALL THIS CHANGE 
HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT WITH THE 
HELP OF PACKT CONGO AND ANVIL 
MINING 
SOON THERE WILL BE STRANGER NAMES 
TO CELEBRATE NAMES LIKE DIVID THE 
U. K.'S DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT POSSIBLY EVEN P. P. P. 
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARNERSHIP 
ONE OF GORDON BROWN'S FAVOURITE 
IDEAS WILL NOW BE TESTED OUT WITH 
BRITISH TAXPAYERS MONEY IN THE 
HEART OF AFRICA 
CRITICS SAY THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN 
CARELESS ABOUT WHOM IT HAS CHOOSEN 
TO WORK WITH 
YOU SHOULD NOT BE CONNECTED YOU 
SHOULD NOT HAVE ALLEGATIONS OF VERY 
SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS 
ATTACHED TO YOUR NAME UNTIL YOUR 
NAME IS CLEARED THEN ARE YOU NOT IN 
THE FRONT RUNNING TO BE A MEMBER OF 
THIS SCHEME 
FOR ENTHUSIST AST IT 
IS A A GROUND BREAKING ALLOWANCE 
IT ENCOURAGES FIRM TO SPEND MONEY 
ON CLINICS AND SCHOOLS THAT SERVE 
THEIR WORKFORCE BUT ON WIDER 
DEVELOPMENT GOALS THIS GRAVEL 
MAKING VENTURE PROVIDES EXTRA 
EMPLOYMENT OUTSIDE THE MINES IN A 
COUNTRY DESPERATE FOR JOBS THE THE INVESTMENT OF DON ORS SUCH AS USAID 
AND DIVID ARE PLANNING TO DO IS A 
REASON FOR COMPANIES TO WANT TO 
CONTRIBUTE TO SOMETHING THAT ACHIEF 
AS HIGHER GOAL THAT SURE MAKES 
THEM LOOK GOOD BUT CONTRIBUTES TO 
IMPROVED GOVERANCE IN THE WHOLE 
COUNTRY 
THIS IS WHERE THE U. K. COUNTRY GOVERNMENT SENT ONE OF MR. BROWN'S 
NEW APPOINTEES SHRITIVADERA TO SEE 
HOW BRITAIN COULD COME INTO THE 
SCHEME MORE PUBLICLY SHE MET THE 
LOCAL GOVERNOR LIKE HERSELF A 
SUCCESSFUL CONVERT FROM BUSINESS TO 
POLITICS HE WAS EXCITED BY THE P. P. P. 
PROJECT 
EVERYTHING THE BRITISH PROJECT TOUCH IT IS A VERY SERIOUS 
GOVERNMENT EVERYTHING WHICH THEY 
TOUCH WILL IS ALWAYS A GOOD ANSWER 
THERE IS ALWAYS SOME FRUIT HE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FRUITFUL FOR 
BRITAIN TO WORK WITH ANVIL MINING 
A FIRM HE HAS HAD A LONG 
RELATIONSHIP WITH 
I HAVE A LOT OF 
RESPECT FOR ANVIL MINING L. WAS 
WORKING FOR THAT COMPANY THOSE 
TYPE OF INVESTOR WE WANT TO COME TO 
ADD VALUE TO OUR LAND 
KINSEVERE MINE OPENED LAST YEAR 
IT'S THE NRGZ AND EFFICIENCY OF 
ANVIL AND SIMILAR FIRMS IN A 
COUNTRY WHERE SO LITTLE WORKS THAT 
HAS MADE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT SEE 
THEM AS AN ATTRACTIVE CHANNEL FOR 
AID HISTORICALLY FEW MINING 
COMPANIES HAVE REPUTATION FOR 
OWNNESS OPENNESS ANVIL'S RECORD 
HAS BEEN CONDEMNED BY HUMAN RIGHTS 
GROUP BUT NOT BY DFID THE 
CAMPAIGNERS CONCERN 
CONCERN CENTRES ON WHAT HAPPENED IN 
THIS TOWN IN OCTS TWO THOUSAND FOUR GOVERNMENT 
TROOPS MOVED IN TO SUPPRESS A BRIEF 
UPRISING AFTERWARDS ACCORDING TO 
THE UN THE TROOPS KILLED SEVENTY THREE PEOPLE 
SOME ALLEGED TO BE THROWN INTO MASS 
GRAVES 
IN THIS WATER THERE IS GRAVES SEVEN BODIES SOME WHERE HERE 
THERE IS TWELVE BODIES A SINGLE GRAVE 
THERE 
THIS WOMAN LOST TWO OF HER THERE SONS IN THE MASSACRE BUT FOR ANVIL 
MINING SHE SAYS IT COULDN'T HAVE 
HAPPENED ANVIL PROVIDED THE 
TRANSPORT FOR THE TROOPS TO GET TO 
KILWA AND SHE CLAIMS IT CONTINUED 
TO HELP THEM ONCE THEY HAD ARRIVED 
ALL THE LORITIES WERE FROM ANVIL MINING OUR MILITARY HAVE 
NO VEHICLES BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOT 
NO VEHICLES ANVIL MINING SENT 
THEIRS TO PWETO TO COLLECT THE 
SOLDIERS WHEN THE SOLDIERS GOT TO 
WHERE THE FIGHTING WAS THEN IT WAS 
ANVIL MINING WHO FED THE SOLDIERS 
PUT THEM UP ALL THE FOOD LODGING 
TRANSPORT THEY NEEDED FOR THE TIME 
THEY WERE THERE YOU SAW THAT 
EVERYONE FROM THE SAW IT EVEN THE LAND 
CRUISERS THE OFFICERS WERE DRIVING 
WHERE FROM ANVIL MINING AS WELL 
ANOTHER SURVIVOR THE LOCAL POLICE 
CHIEF SAYS HE AND OTHERS WERE 
LOCKED IN A MAKE SHIFT PRISON BY 
THE TROOPS AND BEATEN REPEATEDLY BY 
THEM THE SOLDIERS THEN COUNTED 
THEM AND TOOK SOME AWAY UNDER THE 
EYES OF TWO ANVIL STAFF 
TRANCE THEY SAW THE PRISONERS WITH 
ME BEING TAKEN AWAY IN THE VEHICLES 
EVERY TIME THEY CAME THE 
PRISONSONERS WOULD BE COUNTED ONE TWO 
THREE FOUR FIVE THEN THEY WERE MADE TO GET 
INTO THE ANVIL MINING VEHICLES 
THEY WERE THEN DRIVEN OFF TO 
UNKNOWN DESTINATIONS IT WAS ONLY 
AFTERWARDS THAT I LEARNT THAT ALL 
THOSE PRISONERS WERE KILLED 
ANVIL HAS ALWAYS DENIED THAT THE 
COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS STAFF 
SUPPORTED HUMAN RIGHTS' ABUSES IN 
ANY WAY THAT THEY HAD ANY REASON 
TO THINK THEY WOULD TAKE PLACE OR 
THEY WERE PRESENT DURING THE 
KILLINGS LAST YEAR AFTER AN 
INVESTIGATION AT KILWA A CONGALESE 
MILITARY TRIBUNAL ACQUITTED THREE 
ANVIL EMPLOYEES AND NINE GOVERNMENT 
SOLDIERS OF WAR CRIMES CHARGES THE 
TRIBUNAL SAID NO ONE WAS MURDERED 
DURING THE EVENTS ANY DEATHS 
OCCURRED DURING FIGHTING WITH THE 
TROOPS THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS 
COMMISSIONER EXPRESSED CONCERN AT 
THE VERDICT SHE REFERRED TO 
SUBSTANTIAL EYE WITNESS TESTIMONY 
AND MATERIAL EVIDENCE POINTING TO 
SERIOUS AND DELIBERATE HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATIONS A SUBSEQUENT INQUIRY BY 
THE AUSTRALIAN POLICE FOUND NO 
EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY WAR CRIMES 
TRIAL LAWYERS FOR VICTIMS OF THE 
INCIDENT STILL BELIEVE THEY CAN 
LAUNCH A CIVIL CASE AGAINST ANVIL 
IN 
AUSTRALIA FOR 
THEM THE KEY 
IN AUSTRALIA FOR THEM THE KEY ISSUE EXPLORED IN IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
AUSTRALIAN T. V. DOCUMENTARY IS 
WHETHER OR NOT THE FIRM WAS FORCED 
TO HAND OVER ITS TRUCKS THIS SH 
WHAT ANVIL'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE SAID 
THEN 
I REQUESTED ASSISTANCE FROM THEN ANVIL FOR TRANSPORTATION WE 
PROVIDED THAT TRANSPORTATION TO GET 
THEIR SOLDIERS DOWN TO KILWA WE 
HELPED THE MILITARY GET TO WITH A 
THEN WE WERE GONE WHATEVER THEY 
DID THERE THAT'S AN INTERNAL ISSUE 
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH ANVIL 
IT'S AN INTERNAL GOVERNMENT ISSUE 
HOW THEY HANDLE THAT IS UP TO THEM 
NO INVOLVEMENT OF US ABSOLUTELY 
BUT HE DID ADMIT PLANES CHARTERED 
BY ANVIL WERE LATER USED TO 
TRANSPORT PRISONERS BACK NOW THE 
COMPANY SAYS THE TRUCKS WERE COMMON 
DEERPED IT PRODUCED LETTER FROM 
THE GOVERNOR CONFIRMING THAT IT'S 
DATED JUNE TWO THOUSAND FIVE EIGHT MONTHS AFTER 
THE EVENTS 
ADELE KNOWS SHE WANTS THE CASE 
FORGOTTEN SHE CAN'T FORGET SHE IS 
FORCED TO SHARE A HOUSE WITH HER 
SURVIVING CHILDREN TOO TRAUMATISED 
AND INTIMIDATED TO RETURN TO THEIR 
OLD GNOME KILWA IS BRITAIN PUTTING 
ITS NEW ALLIANCE WITH ANVIL AND THE 
LOCAL GOVERNOR AHEAD OF JUSTICE IN 
THE CONGO 
WE WERE APPROACHED LAST 
OCTOBER BY A DIPLOMAT FROM THE 
BRITISH EMBASSY HERE HE DISCUSSED 
THE ISSUE OF THE VICTIMS WITH US 
WE PROOFERED OUR SOLUTIONS THE 
DIPLOMAT SAID HE WOULD ARRANGE 
ANOTHER MEETING WITH US WE ARE 
STILL WAITING THE CALL HASN'T COME 
WE WERE HOPING THE BRITISH 
GOVERNMENT WOULD USE ITS POSITION 
TO MAKE THE COMPANY'S PAY DAMAGES 
TO THE VICTIMS OF THE ATROCITIES 
BRITISH CAMPAIGNERS BELIEVE THE U. K. 
GOVERNMENT IS LETTING THE PEOPLE OF 
CONGO DOWN IN A WIDER SENSE BY 
FAILING TO ENCOURAGE GREATER 
TRANSPARENCY IN THE MINING INDUSTRY 
I THINK THIS IS THE ONE OF THE MOST 
EXTREME CASE THAT IS WE HAVE COME 
ACROSS 
THEY SAY BRITAIN SHOULD BE ACROSS MORE CONCERNED AT REVELATIONS BY 
THE CONGALESE GOVERNMENT THAT ANVIL 
WAS GIVEN ADVANTAGES IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
CONTRACT WITH THE STATE THE 
DOCUMENT FULLY PUBLISHED THIS YEAR 
SHOWED THE FIRM HAD TOTAL AND 
COMPLETE EXEMPTION FROM A WIDE 
RANGE OF TAXES A BRITISH OFFICIAL 
TOLD ME FIRMLY THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
WASN'T HELPING FIRMS ACHIEVE THEIR 
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
TARGETS IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW THEY 
CAN AVOID IT TAKE A LOOK AT ANVIL 
MINING'S WEBSITE YOU CAN SEE HOW 
HIGH UP IN THE ANNUAL REPORT IT 
TALK ABOUTS COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 
PROJECTS WILL YOUING ONE INVOLVING 
USAID IT'S THE THING SHAREHOLDERS 
LIKE TO SEE YOU CAN BE SURE IT 
WON'T BE LONG BEFORE PROJECTS AIDED 
BY D. FID ARE HERE TOO 
ANVIL BUILDING A NEW CLINIC IT'S 
PAID FOR ADULT LITERACY PROGRAMS 
ROADS WATER AND ELECTRICITY 
SUPPLIES IT PENT FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION ON 
DEVELOPMENT LAST YEAR IT'S 
COMMITTED TO PUTTING TEN PER CENT OF PROFITS 
FROM ITS MAIN MINE INTO A COMMUNITY 
TRUST 
ANVIL STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT TRUST WE HAVE TO BE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE 
WHY WHY ON ONE HAND IT'S A LEGAL WHY REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE TO DO 
THAT ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS ONE 
OF OUR CORE VALUES THAT WE SHOULD 
INVEST IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES DFID DFID OFFICIALS SAY WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS 
THAT COMPANIES LIKE ANVIL LEARN 
FROM PASS EXPERIENCE SHOULD 
GOVERNMENT MONEY EASE THAT PROCESS 
I THINK IT'S GOOD IF AN 
INDUSTRIALSELF WANTS TO IMPROVE ITS 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES AND TO RUN PROJECTS BUT 
WHY SHOULD IT HAVE THE BACKING 
PARTICULARLY OF THE BRITISH 
GOVERNMENT IT'S NOT EVEN A BRITISH 
COMPANY WE THINK IT'S SENDING OUT 
A SIGNAL IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU 
DO AND WE WILL HELP YOU IMPROVE 
YOUR IMAGE ABROAD AFTERWARDS 
BRITAIN'S GROWING KEENER AND KEENER 
ON BUSINESS LED DEVELOPMENT 
IMPRESSED UNDOUBTEDLY BY THE 
EXAMPLE OF CHINA CHIEP CHINESE 
FIRMS ARE BUILDING BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS OF INFRASTRUCTURE IN CONGO 
IN RETURN FOR MINERALS NEWSNIGHT 
DISCOVERED THAT BRITAIN'S 
AMBASSADOR HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING FOR 
MONTHS FOR THE U. K. TO COME IN ON 
THAT DEAL IT WILL SPEND SEVERAL 
MILLION TO ENSURE THE CHINESE ROADS 
MEET ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS DOES 
THE U. K. ALSO WORRY THAT WESTERN 
FIRMS MIGHT LOSE OUT IN THE NEW 
SCRABBLE FOR AFRICA 
WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT STRATEGIC INTERESTS IT'S 
CLEAR THERE IS A BIG STRUGGLE GOING 
ON FOR CONTROL AND ACCESS OVER 
THESE MINERALS COOPER DIAMONDS 
THAEFRG THE CONGO HAS NOW WITH THE 
ARRIVAL OF THE CHINESE WHO HAVE 
PUT DOWN NINE BILLION DOLLARS ON THE TABLE 
IN EXCHANGE OF INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 
MINERALS THE WEST IS EVEN MORE 
DESPERATE THE U. S. CANADA OTHER 
WESTERN ECONOMIES TO ENSURE THAT WE 
ARE STILL IN THERE WE ARE STILL 
PART OF THE GAME IF YOU LIKE 
MINING IN THE CONGO IS A MESSY 
BUSINESS BUSINESS DFID ARGUES IT HAS TO WORK WITH 
WHOEVER IS THERE IT CAN'T THEN 
INFLUENCE CHANGE THAT'S PRAGMATISM 
OF A KIND THAT MIGHT BE HARD TO 
JUSTIFY TO BRITISH TAXPAYERS 
OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD HAVE LIKED THE 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SECRETARY 
WHY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS 
SPENDING MONEY IN THIS WAY HE 
DECLINED OUR INVITATION HIS 
DEPARTMENT SAID NO MONEY IS BEING 
GIVEN TO MINING COMPANIES THEY HAD 
RAISE THE THE ISSUE OF JUSTICE FOR 
KILWA WITH SENIOR ANVIL STAFF

IS QUITE LONG ON OUR WEBSITE
