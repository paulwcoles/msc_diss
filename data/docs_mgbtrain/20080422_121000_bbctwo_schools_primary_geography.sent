ALL DRESSED UP BUT WHERE TO GO 
THE CLUE'S IN THE CLOTHES SO DO YOU KNOW 
I'VE FOUND THE PERFECT PLACE TO RELAX 
OH HOW KIND SOMEBODY'S BROUGHT ME A DRINK 
A GLASS WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH ALL OF THESE 
ANDY'S GOING TO NEED THAT WATER THESE ARE NO ORDINARY GARDENS 
THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY THE DRIEST HOTTEST DESERT IN NORTH AMERICA 
SO WHERE IN THE WORLD HAS HE GOT TO THIS WEEK 
WE SENT HIM ACROSS THE ATLANTIC TO THE SOUTH WEST OF THE UNITED STATES 
A TEN HOUR FLIGHT FROM THE U. K. TO THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS 
TWO FORTY K. M. BY ROAD TAKES HIM TO THE DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK 
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
MY TRIP BEGINS IN FURNACE CREEK 
A LUXURY RESORT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT 
THAT LUXURY COMES AT A PRICE IT'S SCORCHING HOT 
FORTY TWO DEGREES CELSIUS 
FAR TOO HOT TO DO ANYTHING 
BUT WE'VE GOT PLENTY FOR HIM TO SEE AND DO 
FINDING OUT ALL ABOUT ONE OF THE HOTTEST PLACES ON EARTH 
DEATH VALLEY 
COFFIN PEAK DEADMAN CANYON 
FUNERAL MOUNTAIN 
WHAT IS THIS PLACE 
DEATH VALLEY WAS NAMED BY THE GOLD SEEKERS 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO IN THE CALIFORNIAN GOLD RUSH 
THEY TRIED TO TAKE A SHORTCUT ACROSS THE VALLEY A BIG MISTAKE 
THE HEAT AND THE HOSTILE TERRAIN WERE A DEADLY COMBINATION 
THEME FROM ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST 
EVEN TODAY YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL CROSSING DEATH VALLEY 
I'VE GOT ALL THIS KIT 
SO I SHOULD BE O. K. BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING 
I'VE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING YOU HAVE 
I'M DALE HOWSLEY DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK RANGER 
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED MORE WATER 
YOU ALSO NEED TO CHECK THIS VEHICLE OUT 
MAKE SURE IT HAS PLENTY OF FUEL AND COOLANT 
A GOOD SPARE TYRE AND TOOLS TO CHANGE IT LAST BUT NOT LEAST 
WHILE HERE DON'T TOUCH ANY RATTLESNAKES 
WELL I GUESS THE SOONER I FIND THIS PLACE 
THE SOONER I CAN GET OUT OF HERE 
WELL I THINK I FOUND THE DESERT THERE'S SAND SAND 
AND MORE SAND BUT WE'RE HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM THE SEA 
WHAT'S IT DOING HERE 
SAND IS MADE UP OF TINY BITS OF ROCK WHICH ARE BLOWN BY THE WIND 
THE RESULT IS SAND DUNES WAVES OF SAND SHAPED BY THE WIND 
A CLASSIC DESERT ON A CALM DAY THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL 
BUT DURING A SAND STORM IT'S PRETTY NASTY OUT THERE 
WELL I'VE SEEN THE DESERT I THINK I'LL SLIP OFF BACK TO THE HOTEL NOW 
IN YOUR DREAMS 
ANDY'S GOING TO DISCOVER THAT DESERTS ARE MORE THAN SAND 
A GOOD PLACE TO START IS UP HERE YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE VALLEY BELOW 
IT'S THE DRIEST PLACE IN THE U. S. A. 
BUT TWO MILLION YEARS AGO DEATH VALLEY WAS FULL OF WATER 
AS IT BECAME WARMER AND LESS RAIN FELL THE HUGE LAKE DRIED UP 
BUT IT LEFT SOMETHING BEHIND DOWN THERE ON THE VALLEY FLOOR 
A THICK CRUST OF SALT 
HERE THE SALT IS COMBINED WITH BITS OF ROCK 
IN WEIRD SPIKY STRUCTURES 
THIS AREA IS KNOWN AS THE DEVIL'S GOLF COURSE 
THIS IS SALT TOO THIS TIME AS THE WATER DRIED UP IT LEFT BEHIND 
THESE AMAZING SAUCER SHAPES 
THESE SALT FLATS ARE THOUGHT TO BE THE HOTTEST SPOT IN THE WORLD 
FORTY FIVE DEGREES 
BACK HOME THIRTY DEGREES FEELS REALLY HOT SO HOW DOES THIS FEEL 
WELL 
IT'S LIKE HEAT BLASTING OUT OF AN OVEN YOUR BODY TENSES UP 
THE AIR FEELS REALLY HEAVY 
AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO WALK 
IT'S REALLY WINDY TOO BUT IT'S A HOT WIND LIKE A HAIRDRYER 
THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO LIFE FORM THAT CAN COPE WITH THIS CHEMICAL DESERT 
LOOKS LIKE THAT INCLUDES ANDY 
DESERTS ARE PLACES THAT GET LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE C. M. OF RAIN A YEAR 
OR ROCKY AND DEATH VALLEY HAS IT ALL 
WHY IS THIS LANDSCAPE SO VARIED 
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN AND YOU MIGHT JUST SPOT A CLUE 
FLASH FLOODS 
THE LITTLE RAIN THAT DOES FALL IN DEATH VALLEY 
OFTEN FALLS ALL AT ONCE 
THESE DOWNPOURS HAVE A HUGE EFFECT ON THE LANDSCAPE 
AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING DEEP CANYONS LIKE THIS 
DALE HOWSLEY HAS SEEN FLASH FLOODS AT FIRST HAND 
WHY DOES RAIN HAVE SUCH A DRAMATIC EFFECT ON THE LANDSCAPE 
THE CLAY DOESN'T ALLOW WATER TO SOAK THROUGH 
SO WHEN IT RAINS IN THE GREAT DRAINAGE UP ABOVE 
ALL THE WATER IS FUNNELLED THROUGH THIS NOTCH 
IT HAS GREAT POWER TO PICK UP BOULDERS COBBLES SILT AND SAND 
AND CARRY IT SCOURING AND SMASHING THE WALLS 
IT'S DANGEROUS HERE IT CARVES THE CANYON THAT WE SEE TODAY 
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF CANYONS LIKE THIS IN DEATH VALLEY 
WHERE DOES THE DEBRIS END UP IT ENDS UP AT THE MOUTH OF THE CANYON 
THE FLOOD HAS GREAT POWER IN THE NARROWS BUT NOT AT THE MOUTH 
THE POWER DROPS THE LARGE BOULDERS ARE DROPPED ON THE GROUND HERE 
WHILE THE CLAY AND SILT IS CARRIED SOMETIMES FOR MILES 
DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAVEL FAN 
ACROSS THE VALLEY ARE SOME OF THE LARGEST GRAVEL FANS IN THE WORLD 
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TONS OF ROCK 
WASHED OUT OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS 
FROM FLASH FLOODS 
TO INTENSE DRY HEAT 
THE EXTREME WEATHER MAKES THIS LANDSCAPE EXTRAORDINARY 
IT'S A SPECTACULAR SPOT WILD DESERT SCENERY IT'S NINETY FIVE PER CENT WILDERNESS 
WE LOVE HAVING VISITORS COME HERE 
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLE PER YEAR NOW 
THE MORE PEOPLE COME HERE AND LEARN TO APPRECIATE DEATH VALLEY 
THE MORE PEOPLE WILL WANT TO SAVE IT 
AND THE LONGER WE WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP IT THE WAY IT IS 
THE BIGGEST TOURIST CENTRE IN THE VALLEY IS AT FURNACE CREEK 
A FEW PEOPLE LIVE HERE TOO 
LIKE THE VON EGGER FAMILY AN UNUSUAL WAY TO GREET A GUEST 
ANDY SEEMS TO LIKE IT 
THEY HAVE LIVED HERE WITH THEIR CHILDREN FOR TWO YEARS 
BRIAN'S THE CHEF AT FURNACE CREEK MITCHELL'S SEVEN SETH'S FIVE 
THE HEAT IS UNBEARABLE HOW DO YOU MANAGE 
WE DRINK A LOT OF WATER I WOULD SAY ALMOST A GALLON A DAY 
IF YOU'RE OUTDOORS DOING STUFF IT'S ALMOST TWO EIGHT LITRES OF WATER 
PHEW WHEN IT'S THAT HOT YOU'RE NOT OUT THAT MUCH 
AH SO THE TRICK IS TO STAY INDOORS WHEN IT'S REALLY HOT EXACTLY 
MY LIPS ARE VERY CHAPPED THE SKIN IS SPLITTING I GET NOSEBLEEDS TOO 
I'VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH NOSEBLEEDS REALLY JUST FROM THE DRYNESS 
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE HEAT OTHER PLACES YOU HAVE ADVERSE WEATHER 
RAIN WE DEAL WITH HEAT RIGHT YES WE DEAL WITH RAIN FANTASTIC 
TIME TO COOL OFF INDOORS 
WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT AIR CONDITIONING UNITS ON RIGHT NOW 
THREE YEAH WOW 
THEY'RE BASICALLY RUNNING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY ALL THREE OF 'EM 
COULD YOU LIVE WITHOUT IT NO 
THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE WOULD BE HERE WITHOUT IT 
AS A MATTER OF FACT A FEW WEEKS AGO OUR CENTRAL AIR 
THE ONE THAT MOSTLY COOLS OUR HOUSE BROKE DOWN AND 
WE WENT TO THE GENERAL STORE AND BOUGHT SOME BIG CHUNKS OF ICE 
WE FILLED UP THE TUB SO YOU PUT ICE IN THE BATH TUB 
AND YOU GOT IN WITH THE ICE 
WE PUT THE BLOCKS OF ICE IN AND SAT LIKE POLAR BEARS AT THE NORTH POLE 
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN SO COLD 
OH YEAH DID YOU GO IN TOO SETH FOR FIVE MINUTES 
FIVE MINUTES YOU'RE BRAVER THAN ME I WOULDN'T DO THAT 
ACTUALLY IT WAS MORE LIKE FOUR 
I LIKE IT HERE DESPITE THE EXTREME TEMPERATURES 
IN THE SUMMER WE GET UP TO THE HIGH FORTIES 
THE HEAT GETS TO YOU AFTER A WHILE AFTER THREE OR FOUR MONTHS OF IT 
YOU'RE READY FOR SOME COOLER TEMPERATURES 
BUT I COULDN'T TRADE IT FOR A DESK JOB 
CHRIS BESSETT 
LOOKS AFTER THE DEATH VALLEY GOLF COURSE HE'S OUTSIDE ALL SUMMER 
BUT HOW DOES HE KEEP THE GRASS SO GREEN 
THE KEY IS WATER 
THIS GRASS LOVES THE HEAT 
OUR WATER COMES FROM THE MOUNTAINS 
TWO SPRINGS PRODUCE MORE THAN A MILLION GALLONS A DAY 
WALTZ OF THE FLOWERS BY TCHAIKOVKSY 
SO WHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD HAS WEATHER LIKE THIS 
LYING NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR 
ARE TWO MORE IMAGINARY LINES THE TROPICS 
CLOSE TO THESE ON THE BIGGEST LANDMASSES 
LIE TWO BELTS OF DESERTS 
THE AUSTRALIAN DESERT 
THE ARABIAN DESERT 
THE SAHARA AND KALAHARI DESERTS 
THE ATACAMA DESERT AND THE GREAT AMERICAN DESERT 
DEATH VALLEY IS AT THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THIS DESERT 
THE DAY STARTS EARLY IN THE DESERT 
IT'S SEVEN A M. AND SETH AND MITCHELL ARE DOING THEIR SCHOOL WORK 
JENNY TEACHES THEM AT HOME 
IT DIVIDES THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH FROM THE CIVIL WAR 
GOOD 
HOME LEARNING IS POPULAR IN CALIFORNIA 
BUT NOT ALL CHILDREN ROUND HERE DO IT 
DEATH VALLEY HAS ITS OWN PRIMARY SCHOOL 
THREE MILES FROM FURNACE CREEK 
WITH ONLY EIGHTEEN PUPILS THEY ALL COME TO SCHOOL ON THE SAME BUS 
IT'S A LONG JOURNEY FOR SOME BUT THEY NEVER GET STUCK IN TRAFFIC 
THE SCHOOL DAY STARTS AT SEVEN 
AND IN THE HOTTEST MONTHS THIS IS THE ONLY TIME OF DAY 
IT'S COOL ENOUGH TO PLAY OUTSIDE IN THEIR PLAYGROUND 
TODAY RAY REDNER'S COME OVER TO PLAY SOME NATIVE AMERICAN MUSIC 
A LOT OF OUR TRADITION AND CULTURE IS PASSED ON THROUGH OUR SONGS 
WHEN WE SING WE ARE PRAYING 
THE NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE LIVED IN THIS AREA FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
LONG BEFORE THE GOLD RUSH 
MOST DON'T AGREE WITH DEATH VALLEY'S GRIM NAMES 
I NEVER LIKED THAT DEATH VALLEY 
BECAUSE IT HAS A NEGATIVE ENERGY TO IT 
DEVIL'S GOLF COURSE DEVIL'S CORN FIELD 
DESOLATION CANYON THAT IS VERY UNTRUE THIS VALLEY IS VERY ALIVE 
SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM CHANGE THAT YOU KNOW 
INSTEAD OF DEATH VALLEY MAYBE UH TOMESHA 
WHICH MEANS GROUND OF FIRE COS IN THE SUMMERTIME 
THE GROUND IS VERY HOT AND YOU CAN'T REALLY WALK ON IT WITHOUT SHOES ON 
IT'S ALSO CALLED TUPEE OPA WHICH MEANS HOMELAND 
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL THIS 
ANDY'S HEADING TO HIS FINAL DESTINATION 
THERE MUST BE A TURN OFF SOON 
THEME FROM THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY 
ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVED IN THE TOWN OF RHYOLITE 
THE PRIDE OF THE TOWN A THREE STOREY BANK 
THIS BUSY BOOMING MINING TOWN SPRUNG UP WHEN THEY STRUCK GOLD 
IT HAD A SMART RAILWAY STATION 
BUT THE GOOD TIMES DIDN'T LAST 
TODAY IT'S A GHOST TOWN THE CRUMBLING RUINS LEFT TO BAKE 
IN THE HEAT AND DUST OF DEATH VALLEY 
SUMMERTIME 
AND THE LIVING IS EASY 
BRAND NEW AUSTRALIAN DRAMA
