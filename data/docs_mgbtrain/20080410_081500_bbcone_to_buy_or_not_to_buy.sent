IT'S A FANTASTIC PROPERTY NO DOUBT JUST EXPENSIVE 
WE'VE GOT THREE PROPERTIES LET'S START THE VIEWINGS 
TIME PLEASE 
OUR FIRST PROPERTY IS A THREE BEDROOMED CHALET IN A GOOD RESIDENTIAL AREA 
BUT IT HAS GREAT VIEWS ACROSS BURTON AND IT'S VERY CLOSE TO MAX'S SCHOOL 
WE MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR PERCEPTION OF LIVING IN A BUNGALOW BUT THIS HAS TWO STOREYS 
THEY'RE NOT JUST FOR THE RETIRED AND ELDERLY THIS HAS GREAT POTENTIAL 
I CAN SEE WHY YOU SPENT FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS LOOKING FOR A PROPERTY 
THERE IS A SHORTAGE ROUND HERE 
WE WERE STRUGGLING THEN I CAME UP WITH THIS LITTLE NUGGET MY FAVOURITE NUMBER ONE 
YOU WANTED THREE DOUBLE BEDROOMS GOT 'EM 
WANTED PARKING FOR TWO CARS GOT 'EM 
YOU WANTED CHARACTER WELL IT'S NINETEEN SEVENTIES BUT IT'S NOT A NEW BUILD 
YOU ALSO SAID YOU WANTED A PLACE THAT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF DIY 
COS YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR OWN TOUCH ON IT 
THAT IS IT IN A NUTSHELL I'VE TICKED EVERY BOX 
PLENTY OF DIY YOU MEAN NOT PLENTY 
THERE'S LITTLE BITS IN THERE THAT YOU'D DO JUST A LITTLE BIT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK HEIDI BE MORE POSITIVE WITH ME YEAH IT LOOKS O. K. 
YEAH IT LOOKS O. K. THAT'S THE POSITIVITY WE WERE LOOKING FOR HEIDI GO ON 
IT'S BROWN IT'S VERY BROWN YES THESE HOUSES CAN BE VERY DECEPTIVE 
THEY CAN BE LIKE TARDISES CAN'T THEY YEAH 
WHAT DOMINIC HAS DELIVERED IS LOCATION O. K. 
YOU WANTED TO BE NEAR THE SCHOOL H. M. M. 
WE'VE ACTUALLY BOTH WALKED THIS IT TOOK ME FIVE MINUTES 
TOOK HIM TWENTY BUT IT TOOK ME FIVE MINUTES HE CAN'T HELP HIS SHORT LEGS 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK YEAH WE'LL GIVE IT A LOOK 
YOU'LL GIVE IT A LOOK DOMINIC WE TRIED 
JUST BE CAREFUL LANKY COS US LOT HAVE GOT THE SAME SIZE LEGS RIGHT 
WE'RE NOT ALL TWENTY SEVEN FOOT TALL 
NIP INSIDE HAVE A LOOK ROUND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK O. K. 
FIVE MINUTES YOU WERE ON A MY LITTLE PONY SCOOTER SORRY CAN'T HEAR YOU DOWN THERE 
THEY HAD A VERY BLASE ATTITUDE I HOPE IT WARMS UP INSIDE 
IT WAS A VERY TEPID RESPONSE LET'S SEE 
YEAH IT'S QUITE NICE GOOD ENOUGH HALL 
WALLS ARE QUITE GOOD PLENTY OF SPACE FOR KIDS' COATS 
LOADS OF SHOES 
BUT QUITE NICE IT'S ONLY QUITE DOMINIC WE WANT REALLY 
THEY'RE RESERVING THEIR EXCITEMENT UNTIL THEY GET TO THE FRONT ROOM 
I'LL RESERVE MY JUDGEMENT AS WELL 
IT'S NICE WITH THE BIG WINDOWS LOTS OF LIGHT IT IS 
IT'S LIKE WALKING ON GRASS THIS CARPET 
NO IT'S NOT A BAD SIZE IS IT 
WE'D GET BOTH OF OUR SOFAS IN HERE 
I MEAN THAT LOUNGE IS SO HUGE ONE END YOU CAN HAVE THE SEATING AREA 
AND YOU'VE ALMOST GOT A PLAY AREA AT THE OTHER END SHOULD THEY SO WISH 
HEY THAT'S QUITE NICE ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
VERY MUCH A BUNGALOW FRONT ROOM ISN'T IT IT IS YEAH 
AH NO NO THAT'S FROM THE OUTSIDE BECAUSE IT LOOKS A LOT SMALLER THAN IT IS IT'S A TARDIS 
I THOUGHT DOMINIC HAD BEEN ON THE DRINK WHEN I SAW IT 
IT DOES LOOK A LOT BETTER FROM THE INSIDE 
IT'S A LOT MORE MODERN COMPARED TO THE OUTSIDE 
FROM THE OUTSIDE INITIALLY I HAD THE SAME OPINION 
IT LOOKS TINY IT'S NOT IT'S A VERY SPACIOUS CHALET NOT BUNGALOW 
AH IT IS A BEDROOM YEAH 
IT'S QUITE SMALL ISN'T IT WOULDN'T BE BIG ENOUGH FOR US 
NO IT'S MORE OF A SINGLE REALLY YOU'D GET A DOUBLE BED IN BUT 
THAT WOULD MEAN EITHER LILY OR THE BOYS WOULD BE DOWNSTAIRS ON THEIR OWN AND WE'D BE UPSTAIRS 
DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM LET'S FACE IT THEY'VE GOT THREE KIDS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND FIVE 
I'D WANT A BEDROOM AWAY FROM THE KIDS I LIKE THAT IDEA 
PUT THEM UPSTAIRS GET THEM OUT THE WAY YOU HAVE DOWNSTAIRS 
PEACE AND QUIET PUT THE FIRE ON AND GET YOUR VINDALOO OUT 
THINK SO LITTLE BATHROOM INOFFENSIVE WHITE NICE TILES YEAH 
GOTTA SAY WHITE BATHROOM SUITE WITH NAVY BLUE TILES IS A VERY GOOD COMBINATION 
BUT THE AREA I WOULD CHANGE IN THERE 
IT'S GOT RED QUARRY TILES ON THE FLOOR VERY COLD AND WHEN WET VERY SLIPPERY 
IT DESPERATELY IS CRYING OUT FOR DECENT LINO OR A BATH MAT 
AH NICE KITCHEN 
OH THAT'S A NICE SIZE ISN'T IT YEAH 
THEY'VE GOT A BIG TABLE IN THERE AS WELL IT SHOWS YOU CAN FIT IT IN 
GREAT KITCHEN CUM DINER REAL GOOD FAMILY SPACE 
STAIRS THAT'S DIFFERENT ISN'T IT 
LET'S LOOK WHAT'S BEHIND THE DOOR 
STORAGE SPACE UNDER THE STAIRS YEAH 
I LIKE THIS ROOM 
POSSIBLY GET AWAY WITH JUST CHANGING THE DOORS AND THE SINK AND THE HOB 
YOU COULDN'T CHANGE THE STRUCTURE MUCH LEAVE THE CARCASSES IN 
YEAH AND JUST CHANGE THE DOORS AND THE WORK SURFACE 
THAT KITCHEN LOOKS TIRED BECAUSE ALL THE WHITE GOODS ARE SHOWING 
YOU CAN SEE THE WASHING MACHINE THE FRIDGE YOU WANT THEM BUILT IN 
INTEGRATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
OH USEFUL SPACE ISN'T IT 
IT'S GOT HEATING TOO WHICH MEANS WE COULD USE THIS AS A PLAY ROOM 
WHAT WE WOULD CALL A CONSERVATORY CONSERVATORY NO SUN AROUND 
DEFINITELY DON'T LIKE THE GAP 
NO IT WOULD NEED TO HAVE A SOLID BARRIER ON THE SIDE OF IT WOULDN'T IT 
IT'S QUITE NICE AND LIGHT UP HERE ISN'T IT 
AH I LIKE THIS ROOM 
YEAH IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT ISN'T IT A NICE VIEW 
NOW THAT'S WHAT I SAID RIGHT FROM THE START 
A FIELD FULL OF SHEEP THAT WAY 
A FIELD FULL OF TREES AND OTHER HOUSES THAT WAY 
AND A NICE SKYLINE OVER THERE 
YOU CAN GET A NICE VIEW FROM A LADDER YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIVE THERE 
HAVE A QUICK LOOK IN THERE YOU'D JUST BOARD UP FROM IT WOULDN'T YOU 
YOU WOULDN'T TRY AND USE THE SPACE YEAH I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT 
QUITE DEEP AREN'T THEY 
THEY TALKING ABOUT US DEEP SENSITIVE FELLOWS 
THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THE ONE DOWNSTAIRS 
IT WOULD JUST ABOUT BE BIG ENOUGH FOR THE BOYS BUT 
AT A STRETCH WOULDN'T IT 
WE'D END UP BEING DOWNSTAIRS WITH LILY IN HERE AND THE BOYS IN THERE 
YEAH IT'S BEING ON A DIFFERENT FLOOR ISN'T IT 
BUT THE KIDS ARE GETTING OLDER GROWING UP 
AS KIDS GET OLDER THEY WANT TO BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS 
THEY DON'T WANT MUMMY AND DADDY JUST BETWEEN THAT THIN WALL 
I'D BE HAPPIER WITH THEM UPSTAIRS I'D HAVE NIGHTMARES ABOUT A FIRE ON THE STAIRS 
IT'S A GOOD POINT TO THINK ABOUT THE KIDS UPSTAIRS IF THERE WAS A FIRE 
THERE ARE WAYS THAT YOU CAN MAKE PROVISIONS FOR THAT 
A LOT OF SAFETY DEVICES ABSOLUTELY 
YEAH I LIKE THE KITCHEN THE LIVING ROOM'S O. K. 
THE THING THAT'S REALLY PUTTING ME OFF IS THE BEDROOM 
DOMINIC THAT WAS A WISHY WASHY OLD AFFAIR NOT HALF 
LET'S GO IN AND LIVEN THINGS UP COME ON 
I'M NOT A GREAT LOVER OF THIS STAIRCASE ME NEITHER 
BY TODAY'S STANDARDS IT WOULDN'T BE LEGAL YOU COULDN'T PUT IT IN A NEW HOUSE 
ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU WITH YOUNGSTERS BETWEEN THIRTEEN MONTHS AND FIVE 
I WOULD REPLACE IT WITH SOLID WOODEN SPINDLES AND A NICE HANDRAIL GOING UP THERE 
NOT EVEN THAT EXPENSIVE I MEAN YOU CAN BUY THEM AT MOST DIY STORES NOW 
ALSO YOU CAN BUY THESE BARS THAT COME DOWN FROM THE TOP STEP OR UP FROM THE BOTTOM 
AND THEY CLOSE THE GAP UP THERE CHILDREN CAN'T GET THROUGH THERE OR THERE 
AND THEY WOULDN'T LOOK ON THIS AS A BIG ADVENTURE AREA EXCELLENT IDEA 
THAT WOULD BLOCK OFF ALL THE SPACE THERE 
AND IF I COULD BLOCK THE GAP BETWEEN THE STAIRS 
AND CARPET IT AS WELL IT WOULDN'T BE SLIPPY YES 
THAT WOULD BE PERFECT LOT QUIETER AS WELL YES IT WOULD 
WHEN YOU WERE WALKING ROUND THAT PROPERTY YOU WERE INCREDIBLY POLITE 
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DIDN'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT 
SO COME ON NOW DOMINIC'S HIDING AWAY 
WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK I WANT YOU TO OPEN YOUR HEART 
POSITIVES FIRST I LOVE THE LOCATION IT'S REALLY QUIET 
WHERE WE WANTED WALKING DISTANCE OF THE SCHOOL RIGHT 
NEGATIVES EVERYTHING ELSE 
RIGHT THAT'S 
IT'S SET OUT WRONG 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT PROPERTIES IS YOU MAKE IT YOUR OWN 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO WITH THE LAYOUTS THERE 
I CAN SEE WHY DOMINIC'S GONE WITH THIS THERE IS POTENTIAL STUFF YOU CAN DO 
MAYBE YOU'LL FEEL DIFFERENT WHEN YOU FIND OUT THE PRICE OF THIS PROPERTY 
COS IT'S ABOUT MAKING YOUR MORTGAGE A BIT SMALLER AND MORE WATERTIGHT 
KEVIN AND HEIDI I CAN'T HELP FEELING DEEP DOWN THAT YOU BOTH LOVE THIS HOUSE 
AND YOU JUST HELD BACK YOUR EMOTIONS M. M. M. 
WHAT I WAS SAYING INSIDE WASN'T IT YEAH 
HE WASN'T HOLDING BACK OUT HERE NO HE'S SAID A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT YOUR CHOICE ALL GOOD I HOPE 
LET'S SEE IF THE PRICE IMPRESSES YOU AS WELL AS THE PROPERTY 
AND I'M GONNA ASK 
LADIES FIRST HEIDI HOW MUCH DO YOU RECKON THIS CHALET IS 
ERM I THINK ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY I'M NOT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY BUT KEVIN IT'S OVER TO YOU

DESERVES A HANDSHAKE THAT COR EXCELLENT 
COULD IT BE THE WEEKEND ESTATE AGENT GIRL KNOWS EVERYTHING 
MAYBE BUT DON'T WORRY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TWO MORE PROPERTIES TO SHOW YOU 
AND PROPERTY NUMBER TWO WILL KICK DOMINIC'S INTO TOUCH BECAUSE IT'S MY CHOICE THIS WAY 
IF KEVIN AND HEIDI WERE TO PURSUE THIS HOUSE 
THEY'D HAVE TO GET THE POND COVERED TO MAKE IT SAFE FOR THE KIDS 
CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEMS ALWAYS NEED CHECKING OUT WHEN MOVING INTO A NEW PROPERTY 
SOME MAY EVEN NEED REPLACING 
NOW THIS PROPERTY IS MY FAVOURITE 
IT'S A SEMI DETACHED HOUSE IN STROLLING DISTANCE TO MAX'S SCHOOL 
AGAIN IT'S IN A DELECTABLE RESIDENTIAL AREA 
THEY'RE GONNA LOVE IT IT'S A SPACIOUS THREE BED HOME 
NICELY DECORATED AND IMMACULATELY PRESENTED 
KEVIN AND HEIDI I DON'T KNOW WHY I'VE GOT THIS FEELING

TWO STORAGE HEATERS IN THE HALLWAY FOR THE WHOLE UPSTAIRS 
INOFFENSIVE DECORATING AND CARPETING YEAH 
IT'S ALL NICE AND NEUTRAL ISN'T IT CLEAN TIDY 
DO YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SMELL A RAT WHEN A HOUSE HAS BEEN PAINTED IN A NEUTRAL FASHION 
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S HOW A LOT OF BUILDERS TART A HOUSE UP QUICKLY TO SELL IT QUICKLY 
I THINK PEOPLE HAVE LEARNT THAT'S VERY MARKETABLE TO USE THAT COLOUR SCHEME 
I THINK IT'S BECOMING UNFASHIONABLE NOW 
HE'S TRYING EVERY TRICK IN THE BOOK 
BOYS' ROOM 
YOU'RE ONLY SAYING THAT COS IT'S BLUE YEAH 
DOUBLE ASPECTED LOOK IT HAS THAT'S NICE 
YOU'LL GET PLENTY OF LIGHT IN THIS ALL THE TIME YES

ONLY ONE WINDOW THAT'S NOT DOUBLE GLAZED NO HEATING AGAIN THOUGH 
ALL YOU'VE GOTTA DO IS WEAR MORE LAYERS WEAR MORE CLOTHES 
IT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY IT CUTS DOWN ON HEATING BILLS AND YOUR WORRIES ARE OVER WITH 
IT WOULD BE CHILLY WOULDN'T IT 
GET THEM TO WEAR ALL THEIR CLOTHES AT THE SAME TIME 
WE COULD LOOK AT WHAT CENTRAL HEATING COSTS IF WE DECIDED TO MAKE AN OFFER 
HOW MUCH DAMAGE IT'LL MAKE TO THE WALLS AND THINGS 
I'M QUITE SURPRISED TO SAY THEY WEREN'T AS COLD ABOUT THIS HOUSE AS THEY WERE ABOUT THE LAST ONE 
KEVIN HERE WE ARE BEDROOM NUMBER TWO 
SOMETHING YOU RIGHTLY POINTED OUT ABOUT EVERY BEDROOM UPSTAIRS 
AND THE BATHROOM THERE'S NO HEATING M. M. M. 
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THAT BEFORE NOT IN A THREE BEDROOMED HOUSE NO 
WOULD YOU WANNA SLEEP IN A BEDROOM WITHOUT HEATERS I'VE NEVER DONE IT I'D ASSUME NOT THOUGH 
NO IT'S A VERY VERY RARE SIGHT BY TODAY'S STANDARDS 
THE ONLY THING I COULD LIKEN TO IT IS KRISTIAN BUYING A BEER M. M. M. 
BUT NOT ONLY THAT IT'S A BIG HOUSE AS YOU WELL KNOW 
LOOK AT THE LENGTH OF THIS CORRIDOR AND THE ONLY THING THAT IS HEATING THE WHOLE OF THE UPSTAIRS 
IS TWO OF THESE UGLY MONSTROSITIES 
STORAGE HEATERS HAVE YOU EVER HAD THOSE BEFORE 
I DID IN MY FIRST HOUSE A VERY LONG TIME AGO 
THAT IS ONE OF MY BIGGEST HATES 
THEY'RE FULL OF OLD BRICKS THEY HEAT THEM UP 
IDEALLY AT NIGHT THEN THROUGHOUT THE DAY THEY RELEASE THE HEAT 
I CANNOT STAND THEM 
GET RID OF THEM YOU NEED A GOOD QUALITY CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEM HERE 
I'M LOOKING AT THIS YOU'D NEED A TEN RAD SYSTEM IN HERE 
RIGHT IT'S QUITE A BIG HOUSE 
I'D HAZARD A GUESS AND SAY YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOUR THOUSAND AND FIVE THOUSAND FOR A GOOD QUALITY ONE 
WOULD YOU SEE THE PIPES AFTER THEY'D FITTED THE SYSTEM 
YOU COULD HAVE WOODEN FLOORBOARDS AND THEY'D BURY THE PIPES 
YOU WILL SEE SOME IT DEPENDS WHERE YOU DECIDE TO PUT THE RADS 
BUT MOST WILL BE BENEATH THE FLOORBOARDS SO THEY'RE HIDDEN 
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK AT REPLACING CARPET AS WELL 
NO MOST OF THIS CARPET COULD BE LIFTED AND LAID DOWN AGAIN 
THEY WON'T RUIN THE CARPET A GOOD PLUMBER COULD LIFT IT UP 
WITHOUT HAVING TO DO THAT BUT THERE IS A FEW QUID THERE 
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO SPEND ESPECIALLY MOVING IN HERE WITH YOUR KIDS 
HEIDI I WANT TO DRAG YOU IN BACK DOWN HERE 
BECAUSE YOU CANTERED WITH SO MUCH JOY AND GLEE ROUND THE PROPERTY 
YOU MISSED THE CONSERVATORY OH RIGHT O. K. 
NOW WE'RE ALLOWED TO GET EXCITED ABOUT TOILETS YES

BECAUSE THERE IS YOUR DOWNSTAIRS LOO WOW THERE IS ONE 
WHY ARE WE SO EXCITED ABOUT THAT

QUITE FRANKLY A LOT OF BRIC A BRAC HERE CLUTTERING UP THE SPACE YEAH 
OPEN THIS UP YOUR KITCHEN'S THERE 
TAKE THAT WALL DOWN THERE AND LET THE KITCHEN SPACE MELD WITH THIS SPACE OUT HERE RIGHT 
A HUGE KITCHEN CUM DINER ANOTHER DINING ROOM THERE I'D HAVE LOADS OF SPACE 
QUITE FRANKLY I THINK I'VE SPOILT YOU 
AN EXCELLENT IDEA ARE YOU FEELING SPOILT YES 
ARE YOU GOING TO BE FEELING PLEASED AND JOYFUL WHEN YOU HEAR THE PRICE 
DON'T KNOW SHALL WE FIND OUT O. K. LET'S DO IT THIS WAY 
HERE YOU GO KEVIN THEY'VE SPOTTED US WAHEY 
HERE THEY ARE THE TWO GNOMES SITTING IN THE GARDEN 
RIGHT O. K. WELL I KNOW THAT YOU LOVE THE HOUSE 
SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NOW IS GUESS THE PRICE TIME 
THE WAY I RECALL IT WHEN YOU WERE GUESSING DOMINIC'S PROPERTY YOU WERE SPOT ON 
AND NOW LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN GO FOR A DOUBLE WHAMMY 
GO ON HOW MUCH DO YOU RECKON 
ERM 
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
OOH INTERESTING RIGHT KEVIN WHAT ABOUT YOU 
I'D GO A BIT HIGHER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY I THINK WOULD YOU 
WOULD YOU NOW ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY 
O. K. YOU WERE ALMOST SPOT ON AGAIN I'M TELLING YOU 
YOU WERE ONLY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY OUT ON THIS ONE 
COS IT'S ACTUALLY ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
SO IT'S TWO UP TO YOU YOU CANNOT WIN 
BUT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO CLAW ONE BACK AT PROPERTY NUMBER THREE THE WILD CARD 
BEFORE WE GO I KNOW KRISTIAN GAVE ME A BIT OF STICK ABOUT MY HOUSE 
BUT BEAR IN MIND THIS ONE IS TOP END OF YOUR BUDGET 
MINE WAS AT THE LOW END OF YOUR BUDGET OH PLEASE 
HAVE YOU BEEN TO A LOBSTER FESTIVAL 
BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING IT ALL THAT 
ALL I'M GONNA SAY IS I CAN SPOT A BARGAIN LET'S GO YES YES 
FIND OUT HOW LONG AGO THE DOUBLE GLAZING WAS INSTALLED 
AND ASK IF THERE'S ANY GUARANTEE LEFT ON IT 
UGLY UTILITY APPLIANCES ALWAYS TAKE UP SPACE 
SO IT'S WORTH THINKING ABOUT MOVING THEM OUT OF SIGHT TO AN ANNEX 
OUR THIRD PROPERTY THE WILD CARD IS A THREE BED HOME WITH A PROBLEM 
IT'S BRAND NEW BUT IT OFFERS A LOT OF HOUSE FOR THE MONEY 
AND I STILL THINK WITH SUCH A YOUNG FAMILY 
A NEW HOME MIGHT BE SERIOUSLY WORTH THINKING ABOUT 
NOTHING NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THE PRICE WOULD ENABLE KEVIN AND HEIDI TO REDUCE THEIR MORTGAGE 
BUT WE'LL CHAT ABOUT THAT LATER 
THERE'S NO PRIZES FOR GUESSING WHY OUR THIRD CHOICE IS THE WILD CARD 
YOU WANTED SOMETHING PERIOD YOU WANTED SOMETHING CHARACTERFUL 
AND WE'VE DELIVERED YOU SOMETHING STRAIGHT OUT THE BOX BRAND SPANKING NEW 
JUST TAKE THE WRAPPER OFF IT BUILT IN THE NOUGHTIES 
SO BEFORE WE LET YOU IN TO CAST JUDGEMENT 
AT THIS POINT HAVE WE FAILED YOU OR ARE YOU EXCITED BY THIS 
ERM DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT WE'D NEED TO HAVE A LOOK INSIDE 
YOU LOOK REALLY EXCITED YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POLITICIAN WITH THAT ANSWER 
KEVIN I'LL RESERVE JUDGEMENT BUT NOT POSITIVE NOW 
THERE'S MANY REASONS WHY A NEW HOME IS GOOD FOR YOU 
YOU'VE GOT THIS BIG NEGATIVITY ABOUT IT LET'S THINK ABOUT IT 
THIS PROPERTY THE LOCATION YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO BE FIFTEEN MINUTES FROM YOUR IDEAL LOCATION 
WE'RE TWENTY MINUTES' WALK OUT HERE SO 
WE DID IT AN EXTRA FIVE MINUTES YOU CAN DO THAT FOR US 
GET IN THERE HAVE A LOOK ROUND AND THEN CAST YOUR NEGATIVITIES EVERYWHERE GO ON OFF YOU GO 
OH THIS IS NICE 
GET YOUR HEADPHONES ON LET'S SEE 
DOWNSTAIRS LOO OH THE DOWNSTAIRS TOILET EXCELLENT 
STAIRS STRAIGHT UP YEAH 
THAT'S USEFUL ISN'T IT 
LIKE THE DOORS 
THIS IS A NICE HOUSE ISN'T IT 
NOT SURE ABOUT THE DECOR 
IT'S BIG ENOUGH IT IS YEAH FIRE'S NICE 
WE'D GET OUR SOFAS IN HERE WOULDN'T WE YEAH 
GOT TWO RADIATORS IN HERE SO YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO HAVE THE FIRE ON IT'D STILL BE NICE AND WARM 
YEAH IT'S A NICE FIRE 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S STANDARD SPEC IN THESE THINGS THAT'S IT 
DINING AREA 
IT'S AN ALL RIGHT SIZE THE KITCHEN'S NICE ISN'T IT YEAH 
THEY'RE MOVING VERY QUICKLY FROM THE LOUNGE TO THE KITCHEN 
NOT SPENDING A LOT OF TIME SOAKING UP THE ATMOSPHERE 
I THINK THEY'RE JUST GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS YEAH 
NICE SIZE ONE OF ONLY TWO ROOMS DOWNSTAIRS THERE'S NO DINING ROOM 
GLASS DOOR'S USEFUL SO I COULD SEE THE KIDS WITH THE DOOR CLOSED 
SEE 'EM AND NOT HEAR 'EM YEAH 
FITTED APPLIANCES VERY NICE 
I HATE TO USE IT BUT IT'S THE PRACTICAL WORD PRACTICAL 
A PRACTICAL KITCHEN FOR A PRACTICAL FAMILY 
FOUR TIMES IN THAT SENTENCE 
OH A PINK ROOM 
LITTLE PINK ROOM FOR A GIRL 
THIS IS NOT A BAD SIZE IS IT IT'S AN O. K. SINGLE ROOM DEFINITELY 
IT IS YEAH ABOUT EIGHT BY EIGHT OR SOMETHING 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
PERFECT SIZE FOR LILY AND DECORATED PERFECTLY AS WELL 
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY HOUSES OUT OF ONE WINDOW 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT THAT'S NEW ESTATES FOR YOU ISN'T IT YEAH 
WELL THIS IS JUST ONE OF A THREE HUNDRED HOUSE ESTATE I KNOW 
JUST THINK HOW MANY BEDROOM WINDOWS YOU CAN PEEP INTO 
WE SHOULD CHANGE YOUR NAME FROM DOM TO TOM 
PLENTY OF PLUGS THOUGH ONE GOOD THING ABOUT NEW HOUSES 
YEAH THEY DON'T SKIMP ON PLUGS NOW DO THEY NO A NICE SIZE YEAH 
OH SHE SAID IT'S A NICE SIZE 
YOU KNOW I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DEROGATORY 
I'M ACTUALLY REALLY SURPRISED SHE SAID THAT 
BEDROOM NUMBER TWO VERY SIMILAR SIZE 
A BIT BIGGER ISN'T IT IT'S NOT MUCH BIGGER 
THIS WOULD BE THE BIG PROBLEM CAN YOU REALLY PICTURE OUR TWO BOYS HERE 
WHERE WOULD YOU GET THE FURNITURE THAT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH YEAH 
A BED THERE YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR 
IF THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OLDER ON BUNK BEDS MAYBE 
YEAH THEY'RE NOT AT THE POINT OF PUTTING IN BUNK BEDS YET ARE THEY 
NO I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ONE 
WE'D END UP IN THIS ROOM AND WE'VE GOT TOO SMALL BIG FURNITURE 
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT SIZE THE OTHER ROOM IS 
NOW HANG ON HERE WE GO AGAIN WE'VE GOT BIG FURNITURE DOWNSIZE THE FURNITURE 
GET A SMALLER HOUSE GET SMALLER FURNITURE IT'S NOT HARD 
BATHROOM 
OH THAT'S NICE YEAH 
NICE STANDARD SHAPE WHITE SUITE 
THAT'D BE BIG ENOUGH COS WHEN YOU'VE GOT A DOWNSTAIRS LOO 
THAT'S RIGHT YOU'VE GOT THIS AS WELL HAVEN'T YOU YEAH 
THIS IS A LOVELY LOVELY BATHROOM REALLY OPULENT REALLY LUXURIOUS 
HERE'S THE MASTER NOT BIG ENOUGH THEY'RE ALL QUITE CLOSE TOGETHER 
IT'S THE BEDROOMS IT IS DOWNSTAIRS IS ADEQUATE 
THIS DOESN'T SEEM MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT ONE THEY'RE ABOUT THE SAME 
I THINK THIS IS A NICE HOUSE FOR A SMALLER FAMILY YEAH 
YEAH NICE IT'S A NICE EN SUITE ISN'T IT STANDARD SIZE 
YEAH IT'S JUST THE SIZE OF THESE TWO BEDROOMS ISN'T IT 
WE NEED THEM TO BE SLIGHTLY BIGGER 
AN EN SUITE WAS NOT AN OPTION IN EITHER OF THE LAST TWO PROPERTIES SO THAT IS A REAL SPECIAL EXTRA 
BUT THEY ARE USED TO IT WITH THEIR CURRENT HOUSE BUT NICE NOT TO LOSE IT YEAH YOU KNOW 
IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE SHOW HOME LOOK AND FEEL 
IT'S JUST A SMALL BEDROOM ISN'T IT 
IT IS REALLY YEAH 
RIGHT RIGHT DOM LET'S GO 
HEIDI I KNOW YOUR EXISTING HOUSE IS A NEW BUILD 
SO I'M NOT GONNA TEACH YOU HOW TO SUCK EGGS 
BUT ALL MAIN NEW HOUSE BUILDERS THEY ALL WORK SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY 
THIS ONE HAS AN INCENTIVE SCHEME FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING 
I'LL TELL YOU AND YOU CAN TELL ME IF IT IMPRESSES YOU 
WHEN YOU BUY A HOUSE WHETHER IT'S THAT ONE OR A BIGGER ONE IT DOESN'T MATTER 
THEY WILL TAKE THE SALE PRICE OF THE HOUSE 
AND THEY WILL TAKE A PERCENTAGE OF THAT AND SAY THAT'S WHAT WE WILL ALLOW YOU 
TOWARDS FIXTURES AND FITTINGS OR UPGRADES 
I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT HOUSE IS 
SO GIVE ME AN IDEA ROUGHLY WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE 
O. K. THEY ALLOW YOU FIVE PER CENT NOW IN MY MIND THAT'S ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY 
THEY'LL SAY YOU CAN HAVE THAT AS AN ALLOWANCE FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT 
YOU CAN CHOOSE IF YOU LOOK HERE YOU CAN SAY I WANT THIS CARPET OR I WANT THIS ONE 
WHICH MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY DEARER THEY'RE THERE AS A CHOICE FOR YOU 
THEY'LL GO THROUGH IT THEY'LL TAILOR MAKE YOUR HOUSE 
YOUR KITCHEN UNITS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE DOORS YOU CAN START OFF WITH SOME FAIRLY PLAIN ONES 
OR YOU CAN END UP GOING FOR THE BEECH OR THE PINES 
BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU GET YOU THEN START EVEN THE OVEN HOBS 
YOU CAN SAY I DON'T LIKE WHITE I WANT STAINLESS STEEL 
IT'S AN OPTION IT'S A GOOD IDEA 
YOU'VE GOT A SLIGHT SMILE THERE YES I LIKE THAT 
ARE YOU WARMING TO THIS ONE SLIGHTLY 
I AM IT'S NOT SO MUCH A BOX WE CAN PERSONALISE IT OURSELVES SO THAT'S GOOD 
IF THEY WANTED EVEN MORE SPACE THEY COULD ADD A LOFT CONVERSION 
BUT WOULD HAVE TO CHECK OUT BUILDING REGS AND PLANNING PERMISSION FIRST 
NEW BUILDING PROJECTS CAN LAST A LONG TIME SO CHECK WHEN A DEVELOPMENT IS DUE FOR COMPLETION 
AND THAT'S VALUABLE INFORMATION WHEN YOU'VE GOT A YOUNG FAMILY 
SO IT'S KEVIN'S LAST CHANCE TO TRY AND ACTUALLY REGAIN SOME DIGNITY 
BUT KRISTIAN BAD NEWS I FOUND OUT FROM THE SITE SUPERVISOR 
THAT WHILE OUR BACKS WERE TURNED KEVIN WENT AND ASKED THE PRICE 
SCANDALOUS SO HE KNOWS THIS ONE HEIDI I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO GUESS THE PRICE FIRST 
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE SO ACCURATE BECAUSE HE KNOWS 
YOUR LAST CHANCE GO ON GO ON GO ON GO ON I'M GONNA GO WITH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
RIGHT COME ON KEVIN 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR OR ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS BUT HE IS ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON 
YES WHAT A SURPRISE I AM SHOCKED 
DON'T WORRY YOU'VE STILL WON THE LONG RUN HE HAD TO CHEAT TO WIN 
HE DID MORE IMPORTANTLY WE'VE BEEN FLYING BY THE SEAT OF OUR PANTS 
WE HAVE SEEN THREE VERY DIFFERENT PROPERTIES AND NOW THERE ARE NO MORE TO SEE 
WE NEED TO KNOW WHICH PROPERTY YOU'D LIKE TO TEST DRIVE OR AS WE SAY TRY BEFORE YOU BUY 
TO HELP JOG YOUR MEMORY WE'VE PUT PICTURES OF ALL THREE HOUSES ON THIS LAPTOP 
YOU ARE A SYSTEMS ENGINEER IN IT SO WE'RE GONNA ENTRUST THAT WITH YOU 
WHY HE'S A CHEAT 
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE YOU GO YOU TAKE THAT 
AT LEAST WE'VE GOT A CHANCE OF GETTING IT BACK 
HAVE A LOOK WE'LL MEET YOU LATER AND FIND OUT WHICH ONE YOU'LL ROAD TEST 
GO AND GRAB A COFFEE CHEERIO SEE YOU LATER I DON'T LIKE CHEATS DO YOU 
YOU ARE ONE YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE 
AND HERE'S A QUICK RECAP OF THE THREE PROPERTIES FOR YOU AT HOME 
NOW ARE HEIDI AND KEVIN GOING TO OPT FOR PROPERTY ONE OUR DORMER BUNGALOW 
ON THE MARKET AT JUST UNDER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY GRAND 
OR PERHAPS PROPERTY NUMBER TWO OUR NINETEEN THIRTIES SEMI 
SLIGHTLY OVER BUDGET AT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY WILL BE RIGHT UP THEIR STREET 
OR FINALLY CAN THEY BE TEMPTED BY OUR WILD CARD 
A BRAND NEW THREE BEDDER AND THE LOWEST PRICE AT ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THIS IS THE FIRST ONE THE BROWN HOUSE 
IT'S GOT THE SPACE BUT I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S SUITABLE FOR THREE KIDS 
YEAH NOT WITH THE SPACE EITHER NO THAT WAS TOO SMALL 
THERE'S POSSIBILITIES BUT IT WOULD NEED MONEY SPENDING ON IT 
YEAH IT WOULD AND AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
SECOND ONE VERY NICE LOVELY 
LOOKS GOOD FROM THE OUTSIDE NICE WHEN YOU WALK IN 
LIVING ROOM NICE SIZE GOOD ALCOVES PERIOD FEATURES NICE FIRE 
NICE NEUTRAL COLOURS YOU COULD MOVE STRAIGHT INTO THAT 
EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT WOULD FIT NEEDS BITS DOING 
KITCHEN NEEDS A BIT OF MODERNISING JUST UPDATING IT'S A NICE SIZE 
YOU COULD LIVE WITH IT YEAH A NICE SIZE THOUGH YEAH 
THE DINING ROOM STRAIGHT OFF IS GOOD THAT'S A BONUS 
IT'D NEED CENTRAL HEATING TWO STORAGE HEATERS 
DOMINIC SAID FIVE THOUSAND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT 
IT'S OVER BUDGET ALREADY AND THEN YOU'VE GOT FIVE THOUSAND FOR THE HEATING 
IT'S AN IDEAL LOCATION FIVE MINUTES TO MAX'S SCHOOL 
IT IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR BUT A LITTLE BIT OVER OUR BUDGET WHAT ABOUT THE THIRD ONE 
THE ONLY ADVANTAGE IS THE PRICE 
YES IT'S A GOOD PRICE 
I'M NOT MASSIVELY KEEN ON THE LOCATION 
ALL THE BEDROOMS ARE TOO SMALL THE DOWNSTAIRS SPACE I THINK 
THEY'RE DOING THE SHOW HOME TRICK NO FURNITURE TO MAKE IT LOOK BIGGER 
IF YOU TRY AND PICTURE OUR FURNITURE IT WOULDN'T FIT IT'S A BIT TOO SMALL UPSTAIRS 
THE SMALLEST BEDROOM WOULD BE AN IDEAL SIZE FOR LILY ON HER OWN 
BUT THE OTHER TWO BEDROOMS ARE TOO SMALL 
WHAT WITH US AND OUR FURNITURE AND THE BOYS WITH ALL THEIR THINGS 
PERHAPS THEY DO A BIGGER VERSION OF THAT HOUSE BUT REALLY 
THE BEDROOMS WOULD ONLY BE BIG ENOUGH IF THERE WAS FOUR OF THEM 
WE WANTED SOMETHING WITH CHARACTER DIDN'T WE PERIOD FEATURES 
THEY'VE ALL GOT GOOD POINTS AND BAD POINTS 
BUT ONE STANDS OUT FROM THE CROWD 
THERE'S ONE THAT'S VERY INTERESTING YES 
YOU'VE SAT THERE WITH THE LAPTOP YOU'VE PERUSED ALL THOSE PROPERTIES 
ALL THOSE MEGABYTES THE RESULT IS A MEGABYTE ON THE BUM FOR DOMINIC 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO TEST DRIVE MY PROPERTY THIS ONE HERE WHICH IS NUMBER TWO RATHER NICE 
BEFORE WE SEND YOU IN THERE TO DO YOUR TEST DRIVE AND TREAT THE HOUSE LIKE YOUR OWN 
WE'VE HAD THE TO BUY'S PROPERTY SURVEYOR TAKE A LOOK AT THIS HOUSE 
DO BEAR IN MIND THIS IS NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY 
IF YOU WANNA BUY THAT HOUSE WE RECOMMEND YOU GET YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT ONE DONE 
WALK WITH ME THIS WAY BECAUSE I'M GONNA START TALKING INITIALLY ABOUT THE BRICKWORK 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS HOUSE IS ALMOST CERTAINLY SOLID BRICKWORK 
BY THAT I MEAN THERE'S NO CAVITY AND YOU CAN TELL THAT 
THESE BRICKS ARE THE HEADERS BASED AT THE EDGES OF THESE BRICKS 
SOME ARE LAID LIKE THAT AND OTHERS LIKE THAT 
WHICH MEANS NO CAVITY INSIDE 
NOT A BIG DEAL NOT NECESSARILY A WORRY 
THE ONLY SLIGHT ISSUE IT CAN CAUSE IS 
IT'S NOT SO GOOD FOR DAMP PENETRATION WITH NO CAVITY THERE 
AND ALSO IT TENDS TO BE LESS ENERGY EFFICIENT 
YOU CAN LOSE YOUR HEAT A BIT QUICKER 
NOT A BIG DEAL NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT AND IF IT DOES BOTHER YOU LOOK AT A DIFFERENT HOUSE 
A BIT LIKE A BALD HEAD WITH NO HAIR IF YOU SEE MY FOLLOWING WE ARE IN STITCHES 
AND TALKING ABOUT BRICKS THE ONLY OTHER LITTLE MINOR MINOR MINOR DETAIL 
IS THAT AT THE FRONT HERE WE'VE GOT VERY NICE BRICKS AND ON THE SIDE 
ON THE SIDE THERE WE HAVE CHEAPER BRICKS SO THEY ARE DIFFERENT 
IT'S A QUESTION OF TASTE AND THEY DID THAT TO SAVE MONEY 
BUT THE GEORGIANS THE VICTORIANS ALL BUILT A FACADE AT THE FRONT THE EXPENSIVE MATERIALS 
THE CHEAPER MATERIALS TO THE SIDE IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF TASTE BUT THAT IS IT 
BIT LIKE KRISTIAN REALLY DRESSES LIKE THAT BUT ALL CHEAP LABELS YES WHATEVER YES 
WE'LL LEAVE YOU TO ENJOY YOUR TEST DRIVE NOW WE'LL FIND OUT LATER HOW YOU'RE GETTING ON 
CHEAP LABELS CHEAP HUMOUR 
HERE COMES THE FAMILY 
TIME TO PUT THIS HOUSE WELL AND TRULY TO THE TEST 
STRAIGHT UP STRAIGHT UP FIND A BEDROOM 
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT KIDS BUT THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE HAVING FUN EXPLORING EVERYWHERE 
CAN YOU SEE YOUR SCHOOL FROM HERE 
CAN YOU SEE YOUR SCHOOL MAXY 
AH EVEN THE CAT'S MADE SOME NEW FRIENDS 
IT'S TIME TO CHECK OUT THAT GARDEN AND THE BLINDS 
AND GET THE TROOPS SOME REFRESHMENTS 
THERE YOU GO WHAT DO YOU SAY 
DO YOU LIKE THE HOUSE THEN MAX YEP 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SLEEP IN THAT BLUE ROOM YES YEP 
NOT THAT THERE'LL BE ROOM FOR LILY TO SLEEP IN 
RIGHT AT THE END THERE'S A LITTLE PINK ROOM 
AND SOMEBODY ELSE THINKS IT'S PURRFECT 
THAT'S IT WE'VE LEFT YOU ON YOUR OWN FOR LONG ENOUGH 
YOU'VE HAD YOUR TEST DRIVE TELL US WHAT YOU THINK OF THE HOUSE 
WE LOVE IT IT'S GOT ENOUGH SPACE 
THE KIDS REALLY SEEM TO LIKE IT 
THE ROOMS ARE ALL BIG ENOUGH 
THERE'S ENOUGH ROOMS FOR US 
QUITE WELL DECORATED 
WE LIKE WHAT THEY'VE DONE AS FAR AS THEY'VE GOT 
THERE'S A FEW NEGATIVES OBVIOUSLY THE PRICE SLIGHTLY OVER 
YES IT DOES NEED WORK 
WE'VE ADDED UP WHAT WE'D NEED TO PUT INTO IT AND THAT WOULD TAKE IT WAY OVER OUR BUDGET 
YEAH O. K. THAT'S THE STICKY BIT 
THERE IS A STICKY BIT SO THE TREPIDATION HERE IS RISING 
I'M FEELING WOBBLY INSIDE FOR YOU 
AS I ASK THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION THE CRESCENDO 
ARE YOU GOING TO BARTER OR ARE YOU GOING TO SCARPER 
WE'RE GOING TO BARTER I JUST KNEW THAT FANTASTIC 
I KNEW YOU WAS GONNA DO THAT 
I COULD TELL BY THE ENTHUSIASM IN YOUR VOICE 
WELL YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS AND WE'VE MANAGED TO FIND A PLACE WE
