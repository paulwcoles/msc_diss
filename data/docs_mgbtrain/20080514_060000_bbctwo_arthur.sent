WHAT'S THAT A MAGNET BUSTER'S COMING OVER TO WATCH BIONIC BUNNY 
THEN WE'RE DOING A SCIENCE PROJECT BUT BIONIC BUNNY IS STARTING NOW 
BUSTER ALWAYS MAKE IT IN TIME

WHERE WERE YOU I MISSED YOU I MEAN YOU MISSED BIONIC BUNNY 
I WENT MINI GOLFING WITH MY NEW FRIEND MIKE IT WAS GREAT

EVERYONE THINKS HE'S REALLY COOL 
MAYBE THE THREE OF US COULD GO OUT 
MIKE COULD HELP US OUT WITH OUR SCIENCE PROJECT 
O. K. BRING HIM OVER TO MY HOUSE AFTER SCHOOL GREAT 
I BROUGHT UP A SNACK FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS THANKS 
HAVE A GOOD TIME 
SO IF THE MAGNETIC FIELD GOES OUT SIDEWAYS FROM ARTHUR

YEAH I BET THEY FORGOT 
REPEAT AFTER ME I WILL NOT GO OVER TO ARTHUR'S HOUSE 
I WILL NOT GO OVER TO ARTHUR'S HOUSE 
I WILL NEVER VISIT ARTHUR AGAIN 
I WILL NEVER VISIT ARTHUR AGAIN 
ARTHUR ARTHUR ANYBODY HOME 
SORRY I WAS JUST WONDERING WHERE BUSTER IS HE'S NEVER AROUND 
TELL ME ABOUT IT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR CATCHER 
BUT HE NEVER SHOWED UP 
I'M NOT GETTING IT YOU GET IT FORGET IT 
WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY HE DIDN'T SHOW HE SAID HE WAS WITH HIS FRIEND MIKE 
YOU KNOW HOW BUSTER'S AN EXPERT ON BIKES 
WELL HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP ME PICK A BIKE BUT HE NEVER SHOWED UP 
WHAT A DRIP 
I HAD ARRANGED TO PLAY SPACEFIGHTER NINE WITH BUSTER OVER THE INTERNET 
HE WAS TO DIAL INTO MY COMPUTER AT FIVE O'CLOCK BUT HE NEVER DID 
SO WHAT IT'S MUCH LESS FUN ON YOUR OWN 
THE POINT IS WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT 
WE CAN'T LET HIM KEEP IGNORING US GIVE HIM THE SILENT TREATMENT 
THAT'S PRETTY HARSH ARTHUR 
BUSTER NEEDS TO LEARN HOW IT FEELS TO BE IGNORED LET'S TRY IT GUYS 
THAT FOOD LINE SURE IS LONG I'M STARVED 
I BARELY HAD DINNER LAST NIGHT MIKE AND I WENT BOWLING

I'M GONNA GET MORE FOOD SEE YOU LATER 
WE SURE TAUGHT HIM A LESSON 
I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE DRASTIC ACTION 
WE HAVE TO GIVE A PROGRESS REPORT ON THE SCIENCE PROJECT 
MAGNETS ARE SUCH A GREAT THING TO DO A PROJECT ON 
EVERY MAGNET HAS A NORTH AND SOUTH POLE 
NORTH POLES ATTRACT SOUTH POLES AND VICE VERSA 
BUT WHAT IF I HAVE A MORE POWERFUL MAGNET
