FLUID LINK YOU'VE LOST IT 
IAN YOU CAN'T HAVE NO 
THE DALEKS TOOK IT FROM ME WHEN THEY SEARCHED ME 
IT MUST BE DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE 
IN THE CITY 
THE DRUG HAS BEEN DUPLICATED 
AND THE DISTRIBUTION 
THE DRUG IS TO BE TAKEN BY SECTIONS OF US 
SO WORK WILL NOT BE INTERRUPTED 
HAVE YOU PROCESSED THE PICTURES 
APPEARING NOW ON FREQUENCY SIX

SHOW SECOND PICTURE 
THE GIRL AND THE YOUNG WOMAN 
IS THAT THE BODY OF THE FOURTH PRISONER 
THE YOUNG MAN 
IF SO HE HAS BEEN INJURED

THEY HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH THE THALS 
IT IS LOGICAL THAT TOGETHER THEY WILL ATTACK US 
NO AND THAT IS MY FINAL WORD 
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU'RE DOING UP THERE SUSAN 
OH IT'S ALL RIGHT MR. CHESTERTON I'M QUITE SAFE 
NO GOOD I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING I KNOW 
THEY JUST WON'T RISK A FIGHT WITH THE DALEKS 
THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GO TOO FAR WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
WHY SHOULD THEY HELP US SOME OF THEM ARE BOUND TO GET KILLED 
WHAT ARGUMENT CAN YOU USE TO MAKE A MAN SACRIFICE HIMSELF FOR YOU 
IAN YOU DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND 
WE'LL BE PRISONERS HERE UNLESS WE CAN THINK OF SOME WAY 
OF GETTING THAT FLUID LINK BACK FROM THE DALEKS I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT 
YOU KNOW THEY'LL FIND A WAY OUT OF THEIR CITY I KNOW NOTHING YOU KNOW THEY WILL 
THEY NEED METAL TO TRAVEL THEY'LL FIND A WAY THEY'RE CLEVER 
THEY'LL FIND US AND KILL US YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS I DO 
EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT I WON'T ASK THE THALS TO SACRIFICE THEMSELVES FOR US 
I'M SORRY I JUST CAN'T DO IT IAN WHY CAN'T YOU SEE 
ANY LUCK GRANDFATHER M. M. M. WELL HAVE YOU MADE ANOTHER FLUID LINK YET NO I CAN'T MY CHILD 
I'VE LOOKED THROUGH ALL MY SPARES AND I'VE REALLY DISCOVERED WE DO NEED SOME MERCURY OH NO 
IT'S PUT US IN A BIT OF A JAM I MUST GET THAT FLUID LINK BACK AGAIN 
I'M AFRAID MY LITTLE TRICK HAS RATHER REBOUNDED ON ME 
WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL TEMPTING PROVIDENCE CHESTERMAN 
WELL DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT NOW DOCTOR IT'S HAPPENED 
AT LEAST YOU'RE NOT VINDICTIVE 
I WILL BE IF YOU DON'T GET MY NAME RIGHT M. M. M. IT'S CHESTERTON 
YES EH I KNOW THAT 
HOW YOU TWO CAN STAND THERE WASTING TIME WITH SMALL TALK BEATS ME 
I CAN ASSURE YOU YOUNG LADY I HAVEN'T BEEN WASTING MY TIME THERE'S ALWAYS A WAY 
YOU ALWAYS THINK OF SOMETHING GRANDFATHER THANK YOU MY DEAR I PRIZE YOUR FAITH IN ME VERY HIGHLY 
YOU ALL REALISE OF COURSE WE CANNOT SUCCEED AGAINST THE DALEKS ALONE OF COURSE NOT 
WE HAVE A READY MADE ARMY HERE THE THALS 
THEY'RE STRONG AND HAVE ONE BIG ADVANTAGE AGAINST THE DALEKS THEY CAN MOVE MORE QUICKLY 
THEY HAVE ONE GREAT DISADVANTAGE NO ARMS OR AMMUNITION 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT YOUNG MAN THE MIND WILL ALWAYS TRIUMPH 
WITH ME TO LEAD THEM THE THALS ARE BOUND TO SUCCEED 
BUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING AND ARGUING ABOUT THIS ALL MORNING 
THE THALS WON'T FIGHT THEY'RE AGAINST WAR 
MY DEAR THIS IS NO TIME FOR MORALS THEY MUST FIGHT FOR US 
WHY OH MY DEAR YOUNG LAD I DO HOPE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE DIFFICULT 
THE DOCTOR'S RIGHT IAN CAN'T YOU SEE 
IF WE CAN GET THE THALS TO ATTACK THE CITY WE CAN BEAT THE DALEKS AND GET THE LINK BACK 
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE YOUNG LADY I'VE BEEN UNDERESTIMATING YOU 
I WON'T ALLOW YOU TO USE THEM TO FIGHT FOR US 
ARE YOU CHALLENGING ME YES I AM DO I HAVE ANY SAY IN THIS OF COURSE 
I THINK THE DOCTOR'S RIGHT AND I WANT TO LEAVE 
I AM SORRY I'M NOT HAVING ANYONE'S DEATH ON MY CONSCIENCE EXCEPT MINE 
AND SUSAN'S AND THE DOCTOR'S QUITE SO 
THE ONLY WAY THE THALS CAN FIGHT IS IF THEY THEMSELVES WANT TO 
IT MUST HAVE NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH US I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
WE MUST HELP THEM TO SAVE THEMSELVES NOT JUST THEM HELP US 
EXACTLY ALL YOU'RE DOING IS PLAYING WITH WORDS 
WE NEED ACTION NOT ARGUMENTS 
NOW LISTEN YOU TWO 
WHAT VICTORY ARE YOU GOING TO SHOW THESE PEOPLE WHEN MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN KILLED A FLUID LINK 
IS THIS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD UP AND SAY THIS IS WHAT YOU FOUGHT AND DIED FOR 
THE THING IS CAN THE THALS STILL FIGHT 
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT ARE THEY COWARDS 
OR ARE THEY JUST AGAINST FIGHTING ON PRINCIPLE WELL HOW CAN WE FIND OUT I'VE GOT AN IDEA 
BUT WHATEVER I DO DON'T INTERFERE I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT I'M RIGHT 
WELL 
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
STRANGE YOUNG MAN HE'S RIGHT THOUGH 
YES HE IS YES WE'LL SEE 
TO HAVE SELF RESPECT 
AT THIS MOMENT ANYONE COULD COME IN HERE 
THEY COULD ROB THEY COULD STEAL LET'S SEE WHAT HE'S UP TO THEY COULD KILL 
AND YOU WOULDN'T LIFT A FINGER TO HELP YOURSELVES WE WILL NOT FIGHT 
THERE WILL BE NO MORE WARS 
LOOK AT OUR PLANET 
THIS WAS ONCE A GREAT WORLD FULL OF IDEAS AND ART AND INVENTION 
IN ONE DAY IT WAS DESTROYED 
AND YOU WILL NEVER FIND ONE GOOD REASON WHY WE SHOULD EVER BEGIN DESTROYING EVERYTHING AGAIN 
I'M SORRY YOU'RE NOT SORRY 
YOU STAND HERE MUMBLING A LOT OF WORDS OUT OF YOUR HISTORY BUT IT MEANS NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL 
YOU CARRY THIS AROUND WITH YOU 
YOUR HISTORY RECORDS WELL IT MUST BE VALUABLE TO YOU 
SUPPOSING I TAKE IT DOWN TO THE CITY AND TRY AND TRADE WITH THE DALEKS EH 
PERHAPS THEY THINK IT VALUABLE ENOUGH TO EXCHANGE FOR OUR FLUID LINK 
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D DO IT I WOULD 
NONE OF US WOULD STOP YOU 
IF I DON'T GET THE FLUID LINK BACK THE FOUR OF US WILL DIE 
PERHAPS THE DALEKS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN PEOPLE 
MAYBE THEY WERE HOLDING US TO EXPERIMENT ON US 
I COULD TAKE THEM AN ALTERNATIVE 
SO THERE IS SOMETHING YOU'LL FIGHT FOR 
HELP CANNOT CONTROL 
CANNOT CONTROL HELP ME 
HELP ME HELP 
HELP HELP 
HELP 
AAGH AAGH 
AAGH 
AAGH 
EMERGENCY EMERGENCY 
ALL DALEKS IN SECTION THREE ARE INCAPABLE OF WORKING 
SECTION THREE 
THAT WAS THE FIRST SECTION TO GET THE ANTI RADIATION DRUG RECEIVED FROM THE THALS 
STAND BY FOR A GENERAL ANNOUNCEMENT 
THIS IS CONTROL 
ALL DISTRIBUTION OF THE ANTI RADIATION DRUG IS TO BE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY 
THE DALEK RACE HAS BECOME CONDITIONED TO RADIATION 
BUT IF YOU ARE RIGHT WE ARE IN DANGER 
ALL DALEKS IN SECTION THREE ARE DYING 
THEY MUST BE EXAMINED IMMEDIATELY 
LOOK THE DISEASE HAS REACHED US IN HERE 
THEN WE CANNOT DELAY 
BUT WHAT ARE WE TO DO IS THIS THE END OF THE DALEKS 
WE NEED RADIATION TO SURVIVE 
SO WE MUST INCREASE OUR SUPPLY OF RADIATION 
BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO DO THAT 
EXACTLY 
WE MAY HAVE TO EXPLODE ANOTHER NEUTRON BOMB 
WHY DON'T YOU SLEEP 
PRESENTLY 
ARE YOU ANGRY WITH YOURSELF FOR STRIKING THE YOUNG MAN 
I KNEW HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE ME DO IT 
BUT I STILL COULDN'T STOP MYSELF 
DO YOU DESPISE ME FOR HITTING HIM 
IF YOU HAVEN'T FOUGHT HIM I THINK I WOULD HAVE HATED YOU 
I KNEW HE WOULDN'T REALLY TAKE YOU AND GIVE YOU TO THE DALEKS 
BUT I FOUGHT HIM 
I WISH TEMMOSUS WERE HERE 
WHAT WOULD HE HAVE SAID DYONI WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
TO TO FIGHT AND LIVE OR TO DIE WITHOUT FIGHTING 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW 
I DON'T KNOW 
WE ALWAYS DO WHAT THE LEADER OF OUR RACE DECIDES FOR US 
HE NEVER DECIDES ANYTHING WITHOUT OUR FULL APPROVAL 
AND IF ALYDON DECIDES NOT TO HELP US 
WELL WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE MORNING 
WHAT'S THAT LIGHT IN THE SKY 
A REFLECTION FROM THE CITY I SUPPOSE NO THE LAKE 
SOME SORT OF CHEMICAL IN THE WATER THAT MAKES IT GLOW IN THE MOONLIGHT 
YOU'VE BEEN DOWN THERE 
YES 
THERE'S HORROR DOWN THERE IN THE SWAMP 
FIVE OF US WENT THERE IN SEARCH OF FOOD 
ONLY MY BROTHER AND I CAME BACK 
WELL WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHERS 
WE FOUND WHAT WAS LEFT OF 
ONE OF THEM 
THE LAKE IS ALIVE WITH MUTATIONS BRED AND CROSS BRED 
UNTIL THE ORIGINAL HAS LONG BEEN REPLACED BY 
I'M BEING MORBID 
OH I DON'T MIND AS LONG AS WE'RE THIS FAR AWAY 
I WONDER THE DALEKS HAVEN'T CLEANED IT OUT KILLED EVERYTHING WHY SHOULD THEY 
ISN'T IT THE PERFECT DEFENCE FOR THE BACK OF A CITY 
ONLY A FOOL WOULD ATTACK THE CITY FROM THE LAKE 
HAS THE ANTI RADIATION DRUG DISTRIBUTION BEEN STOPPED YES 
ONLY DALEKS IN SECTION TWO AND THREE RECEIVED IT 
ALL DALEKS IN SECTION THREE HAVE NOW DIED 
DALEKS IN SECTION TWO ARE TO BE BROUGHT TO THE SONIC CHAMBER 
WE WILL DIRECT THE AIR POLLUTED BY RADIATION 
AWAY FROM THE NUCLEAR REACTORS INTO THE SONIC CHAMBER 
AND IF THEY DO NOT DIE WE SHALL HAVE OUR ANSWER 
BUT IF WE NEED RADIATION WE CAN NEVER REBUILD THE WORLD OUTSIDE 
WE DO NOT HAVE TO ADAPT TO THE ENVIRONMENT 
WE WILL CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT TO SUIT US 
I HAVE ONE QUESTION TO ASK YOU 
IF WE DO NOT HELP YOU WHAT WILL YOU DO 
WE'LL FIND OUR WAY INTO THE CITY AND TAKE BACK OUR LOST EQUIPMENT 
YOU SEE WE CANNOT STAND BY AND LET THESE PEOPLE DIE 
IF WE DO NOT HELP THEM IT WOULD BE THE SAME AS IF WE HAD KILLED THEM OURSELVES 
THE WAY I HAVE REASONED IS THIS 
THE DALEKS ARE STRONG AND THEY HATE US 
AND I'M SURE THEY WILL FIND A WAY TO COME OUT OF THEIR CITY AND KILL US 
SO IT IS NOT MERELY A QUESTION OF WHETHER WE GO OFF IN A VAIN SEARCH FOR FOOD 
AND IN ALL PROBABILITY STARVE TO DEATH WE FACE DEATH NOW 
IN THE CITY IS ENOUGH FOOD FOR ALL OF US AND ALL OF THE DALEKS A HUNDRED TIMES OVER 
MY CONCLUSION IS THIS 
THERE IS NO INDIGNITY IN BEING AFRAID TO DIE 
BUT THERE IS A TERRIBLE SHAME IN BEING AFRAID TO LIVE 
IF NONE OF YOU AGREE WITH MY REASONS THEN LET ME GO WITH THESE PEOPLE 
AND I WILL HELP YOU ELECT A NEW CHIEF 
I'LL GO WITH YOU ALYDON AND I 
LET'S START AT ONCE AND I 
THANK YOU 
YOU KNEW WHAT MY DECISION WOULD BE 
I COULD ALWAYS HAVE DESTROYED IT IF YOU DECIDED DIFFERENTLY 
IF WE GET THIS INTELLIGENT ANTICIPATION WE SHALL SUCCEED 
LET US SEE THIS 
NOW WHAT IS THIS AREA HERE 
THE SWAMP HERE ARE THE MOUNTAINS THIS IS THE FAR SIDE OF THE CITY 
I'VE BEEN INTO THE SWAMP IT'S SURROUNDED BY LAKES HERE SEE 
THE LAKES ARE INHABITED BY ALL SORTS OF STRANGE CREATURES 
CAN WE GET INTO THE CITY THIS WAY OVER THE MOUNTAINS YES THAT MEANS GOING THROUGH THAT SWAMP 
WE CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SWAMP IT'S TOO DANGEROUS IT'S DANGEROUS BUT 
I REALISED LAST NIGHT TALKING TO BARBARA 
THAT IT IS UNDEFENDED UNDEFENDED IT'S A PERFECT NATURAL BARRIER 
ALL THOSE CREATURES YOU KNOW THAT I MEAN THE DALEKS WON'T BE ON GUARD THERE 
THERE'S A CHANCE TO TAKE THEM BY SURPRISE 
BELIEVE ME IT'S THE BEST CHANCE THERE IS 
YES YES WELL NOW I SUGGEST WE SPLIT INTO TWO GROUPS 
THE ONE TO DISTRACT THE DALEKS ON THE CITY WALL SIDE 
THE OTHERS TO TRY AND FORCE A WAY THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS 
YES I THINK THAT'S THE BEST PLAN ARE WE ALL AGREED YES VERY WELL THEN 
THAT IS WHAT WE MUST DO 
THE LASER SCOPE IS TRANSMITTING 
THE QUALITY IS POOR 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
HAS THIS GROUP BROKEN AWAY 
IS THERE A PLAN BEHIND IT 
WHY DIVIDE THEIR FORCES 
THE FIGURES ARE COMING THROUGH ON THE RADIATION TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUE LASER SCOPE 
THERE IS AN IMPROVEMENT 
EXCEPT FOR ONE SERIOUS CASE 
ALL DALEKS IN SECTION TWO HAVE SHOWN SIGNS OF RECOVERY 
THEN OUR POSITION IS CLEAR 
FOR US THE DRUG IS A POISON 
AND RADIATION IS STILL NECESSARY TO US 
ESSENTIAL 
I WANT A COMPLETE SURVEY OF OUR STOCK OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS 
I WANT AN ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF WASTE MATTER 
FROM THE NUCLEAR REACTORS 
WE'LL NEVER GET THROUGH YES WE WILL 
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK IT'LL BE ANY DIFFERENT TO THE FIRST TIME 
WE KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT THEY DON'T 
WE PROMISED ALYDON WE'D FIND A WAY THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS 
THEY WOULDN'T FOLLOW YOU IF YOU TOLD THEM WHAT HAPPENED 
HOW WE WATCHED AMMOSUS DRAGGED BENEATH THE WATERS OF THE LAKE 
HOW YOU AND I RAN IN TERROR WHEN THAT'S ENOUGH 
WE'RE GOING ON ANTODUS 
KEEP YOUR FEARS TO YOURSELF AND DON'T UPSET THE OTHERS 
IS THAT CLEAR YES WELL IS IT 
YES 
WELL THIS IS THE SWAMP 
FROM NOW ON IT'S GOING TO BE RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE 
YES I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN THE GROUND'S VERY UNEVEN 
SOMETIMES ROCK SOMETIMES THICK MUD WATCH HOW YOU WALK 
I THINK IT WOULD BE WISE TO FIND A RESTING PLACE FOR THE NIGHT 
YES WELL WE'VE MADE VERY GOOD TIME 
ONLY TAKEN FOUR HOURS TO GET HERE FROM THE EDGE OF THE FOREST 
THAT LEAVES US WITH TWO AND A HALF DAYS TO GO THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS TO THE CITY IF THERE IS A WAY THROUGH 
WE'LL FIND A WAY I'M GOING TO GIVE BARBARA A HAND I'M SURPRISED YOU LET HER COME 
I'D BE MORE SURPRISED IF I COULD HAVE STOPPED HER 
HOW ARE YOU DOING FINE 
OH I'M GLAD THE MOUNTAINEERING'S OVER 
THERE'LL BE SOME MORE ONCE WE GET THROUGH THIS LOT WE'RE GOING THROUGH THERE WE MUST 
WE'VE GOT A DEADLINE WITH THE DOCTOR IN TWO AND A HALF DAYS 
WELL I THINK WE COULD ALL DO WITH A REST 
NO WE'LL KEEP UP WITH THE OTHERS 
THEY'LL BE BREAKING CAMP SOON 
NOW TAKE CARE 
WATCH WHERE YOU PUT YOUR FEET 
ALL RIGHT YES 
THIS LOOKS LIKE A FAIRLY DRY SECTION 
YES THIS'LL DO RIGHT WE'LL MAKE CAMP HERE 
SEE IF YOU CAN GATHER UP SOME DRY BRANCHES 
IT'LL MAKE IT MORE COMFORTABLE TO SLEEP ON 
BARBARA YOU SEE TO THE FOOD I'LL GET THE FIRE GOING 
RIGHT 
AT LEAST IN MIGHT STOP SOME OF THESE 
THESE THINGS FROM BOTHERING US 
WHAT WAS IT DID YOU SEE ANYTHING YES IT WAS KRISTAS STAND GUARD HERE WILL YOU RIGHT 
WE'LL TAKE THE FIRST WATCH BETWEEN US 
YES BUT I THINK YOU TWO EARTH PEOPLE SHOULD GET AS MUCH SLEEP AS POSSIBLE 
WE'RE MORE USED TO THIS KIND OF LIFE 
IT'S OVER A YEAR SINCE WE LEFT OUR OWN PLATEAU IN SEARCH OF A NEW SOURCE OF FOOD 
I'D ALMOST FORGOTTEN WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO STAY IN ONE PLACE AND ENJOY IT 
I SUPPOSE THERE'LL BE AN END TO IT ONE DAY 
TIME TO MOVE MY FRIEND 
YOU LET ME SLEEP YES 
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAKE ME GANATUS 
WHAT'S THE MATTER COME AND SEE WHAT I'VE FOUND BY THE LAKE 
RIGHT HOLD ON I'LL COME WITH YOU 
MORNING MORNING 
OH FOR A FEATHER PILLOW AND A SPRING MATTRESS 
WHAT DID YOU SEE OVER THERE 
WE WERE RIGHT THE DALEKS DO GET THEIR WATER FROM THE LAKE 
BUT HOW DO WE GET TO THE CITY FROM THERE THERE MUST BE A WAY THE DALEKS AREN'T VERY MOBILE 
THEY MUST HAVE CUT A PATHWAY THROUGH THERE TO WORK ON THE PIPELINE 
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE US TO REACH THERE MOST OF THE DAY 
IF WE COULD CROSS THE LAKE WE COULD REACH IT QUICKER SORRY THAT'S ONE WAY I'M NOT GOING 
IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS THE LAKE IS FULL OF MUTATIONS NO WE MUST GO ROUND YES 
WE SHOULD TRY AND GET THERE BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN I'LL FILL THE WATER BAGS 
THERE'S NO POINT IN TRYING TO CROSS THE LAKE YOU THINK NO 
NO HE'S RIGHT 
ANYWAY THINK HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO BUILD A RAFT 
BARBARA WE SAW SOME PIPES GOING INTO THE LAKE 
SO WE CAN GO THROUGH MAYBE 
WITH A BIT OF LUCK EH THANKS 
M. M. M. GOOD WELL WHERE'S ELYON 
HE'S GONE TO FILL THE WATER BAGS HE WON'T BE LONG 
STAY HERE 
WE'RE IN POMPEII AND IT'S VOLCANO DAY 
YOU SAVE PEOPLE NOT THIS TIME 
SHOW YOURSELF I MUST MAKE THE MOST TERRIBLE CHOICE 
DONNA DOCTOR
