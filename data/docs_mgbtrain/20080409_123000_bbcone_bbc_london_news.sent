MUCH PART OF THE APPROACH THAT WE 
ARE TAKING TWO KNIVES IN 
WESTMINSTER CARRYING KNIVES IS NOT 
JUST A LEGAL IT IS UNACCEPTABLE 
ILLEGAL 
THE DIFFICULTY WOULD BE ILLEGAL THAT CHILDREN MIGHT GET KNIVES FROM 
THEIR PARENTS

AVAILABILITY OF KNIVES AND GIVING 
THAT MESSAGE TO RETAILERS THEY

YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW WHAT A BLOG 
IS TO HAVE SEEN ITS EFFECT ON LINE 
DIARIES AND WEB PAGES HAVE HAD A 
BIG IMPACT ON THE RACE TO BECOME 
MAYOR OF LONDON 
IN A BAR OR REFORM ARE SOMEWHERE 
NEAR YOU THERE IS PROBABLY A 
BLOGGER THIS WOMAN CO ED IT'S A 
WEBSITE IN HER SPARE TIME SHE 
COVERS STORIES AS DIVERSE AS TOWER 
BRIDGE AND THAMES MARINE LIFE AND 
THE MAYORAL ELECTION 
WE ARE 
ENTIRELY NON PARTISAN WE DO NOT 
BACK A PARTICULAR CANDIDATE SHE SHE KNOWS A THING OR TWO ABOUT WHAT 
WORKS ON THE WEB SO WE ASKED HER 
FOR HER VIEW ON THE WEBSITES OF THE 
MAIN THREE CANDIDATES STARTING 
WITH THE RECENTLY RELAUNCHED ITS 
BRIAN PADDICK SITE 
IT IS VERY PERSONAL 
HE REALLY 
LIKES TO TELL YOU ABOUT HIMSELF 
BUT IT DOES FEEL A BIT LIKE AN 
INTERNET DATING PAGE 
MOVING ON TO 
BORIS STRONG PRIMARY COLOURS NOT 
THE PLACE TO FIND OUT THE GOSSIP ON 
THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE THERE THERE IS SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING FOOTAGE 
OUT THERE WHICH IS NOT APPROVED BY 
BORIS BUT SHE WOULD NOT GO HERE TO 
FIND IT THIS IS ONE OF THAT 
DULLEST CENTRES YOU COULD FIND ON ON TO KEN LIVINGSTONE'S PAGE HAZEL 
LIKES THE LAYOUT BUT NOT THE 
CONTENT THE PROBLEM IS KEN 
LIVINGSTONE'S BLOCK AMUSING 
SUPPOSEDLY IT SEEMS TO BE WRITTEN 
BY SOMEONE ELSE 
IF IT IS WRITTEN 
IN THE THIRD PERSON BY KEN THAT IS 
STRANGE IT DIVIDENDS IF IT IS 
WRITTEN IN THE THIRD PERSON BECAUSE 
IT IS NOT WRITTEN BY KEN THEN IS 
IT A PRESS RELEASE 
THE QUESTION IS 
WILL ALL THIS INTERNET ACTIVITY 
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO HOW PEOPLE 
VOTE ON 
FIRST 
YOU HAVE ONE WEEK LEFT TO REGISTER 
TO VOTE YOU CAN GET MORE ON THAT 
AND A LIST OF ALL THE CANDIDATES ON 
OUR WEBSITE THE ADDRESS IS ON YOUR 
SCREEN 
IT WAS DESPAIR AND DELIGHT IN EQUAL 
MEASURE FOR LONDON'S TEAM'S LAST 
NIGHT ARSENAL CRASHED OUT TO 
LIVERPOOL BUT CHELSEA REMAIN ON 
COURSE AFTER WINNING AT STAMFORD 
BRIDGE 
FRANK LAMPARD PUT AN END TO THE 
NERVES OF CHELSEA THEY WON TWO TO ZERO ON 
THE NIGHT THREE TO TWO ON AGGREGATE TO 
BEAT FENNA BACHER IMMEDIATELY 
TONGUES STARTED TO WAG AS THE 
VICTORY SETS UP YET ANOTHER 
SHOWDOWN WITH LIVERPOOL 
REVENGE IS 
A DANGEROUS EMOTION TO TAKE INTO A 
FOOTBALL MATCH IT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT TO CONCENTRATE AND PLAY 
WITH A COOL HEAD THE IDEA OF 
REVENGE MEANS YOU DO NOT PLAY WITH 
YOUR HEAD AS MUCH THOSE PREVIOUS 
GAMES WILL HAVE NO BEARING ON THIS 
SEASON 
CHELSEA ARE NOTHING IF NOT SEASON CONSISTENT A FOURTH CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE SEMI FINAL IN THE PAST SIX 
SEASONS FOR ARSENAL HOWEVER IT 
HAS ALL GONE WRONG AGAIN ARSENE 
WENGER MUST FEEL HE IS JINXED WHEN 
IT COMES TO EUROPE ARSENAL FANS 
MAY WISH TO LOOK AWAY NOW CRUELTY 
TO FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS WILL FOLLOW 
LESS THAN SEVEN MINUTES OF AN 
INCREDIBLE MATCH AGAINST LIVERPOOL 
REMAINED AND SURELY SURELY 
ARSENAL WERE BOUND FOR THE SEMI 
FINALS NOW YOU DECIDE IF THE 
REFEREE WAS CORRECT TO AWARD A 
PENALTY BUT ARSENAL'S DREAM OF 
WINNING THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE MUST 
WAIT AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR 
THERE IS PLENTY OF TALENT AND 
POTENTIAL IN THIS TEAM AND THEY ARE 
MENTALLY STRONG BUT WE LACK STILL 
A BIT OF MATURITY IN SOME 
SITUATIONS 
EMOTIONS IN NORTH AND SITUATIONS WEST LONDON COULD NOT CONTRAST MORE 
ARSENAL DEEP DISAPPOINTMENT 
CHELSEA DREAMING OF TAKING THEIR 
RUSSIAN BILLIONAIRE OWNER TO A 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE FINAL IN MOSCOW 
THE TRAINING SHOULD BE COMPLETE 
THE TRAINERS READY TO GO NOW 
FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE PREPARING TO TAKE 
PART IN THIS YEAR'S MARATHON 
INCLUDING THESE MASAI WARRIORS 
WILL BE LOOKING AHEAD TO THE AGONY 
AND HOPE FOR THE ECSTASY ON SUNDAY 
THEY HAVE BEEN LINING UP THIS 
MORNING TO REGISTER FOR THE EVENT 
I AM JOINED NOW BY THE RACE 
DIRECTOR DAVE BEDFORD AND FORMER 
LONG DISTANCE RUNNER AND A 
FORMER LONG DISTANCE RUNNER WHAT 
DO YOU THINK IS THE ENDURING 
POPULARITY OF THE MARATHON 
I THINK IT IS THE MIX OF THE ELITE 
ATHLETES MIXED IN WITH ALL OF THE 
FANCY DRESS RUNNERS AND SOME OF 
THE WONDERFUL STORIES WE WERE HERE 
THIS MORNING WHEN THE MARATHON 
EXHIBITION OPENED AND THE MASAI 
WARRIORS GOT AN INCREDIBLE 
RECEPTION WHEN THEY OPENED THE 
EXHIBITION AND WHEN THEY GO OUT ON 
THE STREETS OF LONDON ON SUNDAY 
THE CROWDS WILL GO ABSOLUTELY WILD 
THESE GUYS HAVE NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE 
OF THEIR COUNTRY BEFORE NEVER BEEN 
ON AN AEROPLANE NEVER RUN A 
MARATHON BEFORE AND I THINK THEY 
WILL SEE A WONDERFUL RECEPTION FROM 
THE BRITISH PEOPLE 
YOU YOURSELF 
HAVE RUN A MARATHON A WORLD CLASS 
ATHLETE I THINK WE CAN SEE SOME 
PICTURES FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE OR YOU SETTING 
A WORLD RECORD HAVE YOU GOT ANY 
ENCOURAGEMENT FOR RUNNERS THIS 
SUNDAY SUNDAY WELL IT IS DIFFICULT TO GIVE 
ADVICE BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOT SUCH A 
RANGE OF PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE ARE 
RUNNING IN TWENTY FIVE HOURS AND SOME 
PEOPLE ARE DOING IT IN SEVEN HOURS 
OR MORE THINK THE BEST ADVICE 
THAT I CAN GIVE TO ANY BODY IS DO 
NOT START TOO FAST IF YOU CAN GET 
TO HALF WAY AND FEEL HALF DECENT 
REASONABLY UNDER CONTROL THEN 
YOU'RE GOING TO GET ROUND 
I AM 
AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE 
IT NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S A 
LOOK AT THE WEATHER NOW 
AS FAR AS TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY 
IS CONCERNED ON SUNDAY I THINK IT 
IS GOING TO FEEL VERY SIMILAR TO 
TODAY THE DIFFERENCE WILL BE THE 
BREEZE SLIGHTLY STRONGER AND 
THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE MORE SHOWERS 
AROUND 
THERE COULD BE THE ODD LIGHT SHOWER 
TODAY BUT FOR MOST OF US IT WILL 
BE DRY THIS AFTERNOON PLENTY OF 
WARM SUNSHINE NOW THIS EVENING 
THE SHOWERS WILL DISAPPEAR VERY 
GRADUALLY THE CLOUD WILL DISAPPEAR 
AS WELL AND THEN OVERNIGHT TONIGHT 
THE BREEZE WILL DISAPPEAR AS WELL 
SO CLEAR AGAIN TONIGHT BUT THE 
TREND CONTINUES IT WILL NOT BE 
QUITE AS COLD AS IT WAS LAST NIGHT 
YES A LITTLE BIT OF FROST IN THE 
COUNTRYSIDE WATCH OUT FOR THAT IN 
THE MORNING BECAUSE THE MIST COULD 
TURN INTO FOG BEFORE IT EVENTUALLY 
CLEARS 
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE A FEW LIGHT 
SHOWERS TOMORROW FRIDAY THE 
SHOWERS ARRIVE AND THEY WILL BE 
WITH US OVER THE WEEKEND
