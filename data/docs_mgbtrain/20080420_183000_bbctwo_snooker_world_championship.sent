DON'T WANT TO BE NOBODY'S HERO 
HELLO FROM SHEFFIELD WITH SEVEN 
TIMES WORLD CHAMPION STEPHEN HENDRY 
HAVE KICKED OFF THIS TWENTY THIRD CRUCIBLE 
CAMPAIGN HE HAS BEEN A CENTRAL 
FIGURE IN SNOOKER FOR TWO DECADES 
AND ARRIVED HAVING SLIPPED DOWN THE 
RANKINGS AND DRAWN TO PLAY THE 
HIGHLY RATED NORTHERN IRISH MARK 
ALLEN HERE IS THE STORY OF THE 
FIRST SIX FRAMES 
ONCE STEPHEN AND MARK HAD DISPENSED 
WITH THE PLEASANTRIES BATTLE 
COMMENCED WITH THE SEVEN TIMES 
CHAMPION TAKING THE FIRST FRAME 
ALTHOUGH BOTH PLAYERS SHOWED SIGNS 
OF NERVES 
THE YOUNG MAN FROM ANTRIM HAS SHOWN 
HE IS NOT ONE TO BE OVERAWED BY THE 
BIG OCCASION THIS AGGRESSIVE SHOT 
TO SET UP A BREAK OF SEVENTY 
IN THE NEXT HE TOPPED IT UP WITH A 
BREAK OF EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH INCLUDED THIS 
SUPER POSITIONAL SHOT HE LED TWO TO ONE 
AND THE LEAD INCREASED TO THREE TO ONE AFTER 
HE FIRED A QUICK NINETY ONE 
STEPHEN WASN'T GETTING A LOT OF 
TABLE TIME AND WHEN HE HAD HIS 
CHANCES HE COULD NOT CONVERT THEM 
ONCE AGAIN MARK CLEARED UP 
BUT THE GAME'S GREATEST EVER 
CENTURION RECORDED CAREER SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN TO 
TAKE THE SCORE TO FORTY TWO OF TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY TWO 
ACTION NOW FROM THE FINAL FRAMES OF 
THE OPENING SESSION IN FRAME SEVEN 
IT IS STEPHEN AT THE TABLE A POINT 
BEHIND COMMENTARY BY JOHN VIRGO 
AND DENNIS TAYLOR 
EARLY ON IN THE MATCH HE COMMITTED 
TO A SIMILAR SHOT SUCH AS THIS THE 
MORE PACE THE MORE CHANCE YOU ARE 
GOING TO MISS IT HE WAS UNLUCKY 
HIS LONG POT SUCCESS IS DOWN TO TWENTY THREE 
PER CENT 
IT IS A BIT TIGHT THAT HE WOULD 
LOVE TO STUN THROUGH THE REDS BUT 
THAT LOOKS A BIT TIGHT HE HAS 
ANOTHER RED AVAILABLE INTO THE LEFT 
CORNER POCKET BUT NOT AS EASY FOR 
THE POSITION THE WHITE WILL BE 
GOING TOWARDS THE REDS IT IS NOT 
STRAIGHTFORWARD NOW THIS IS QUITE 
AN IMPORTANT SHOT LOOKING AT THE 
ANGLE HE HAS BLACK WILL ONLY GO 
INTO THE LEFT CORNER POCKET 
IT WAS THE PINK HE WAS HOPING TO BE 
ON SOMEHOW HE HAS LEFT A CHANCE 
OF THE BLACK ALTHOUGH THAT IS NOT 
EASY 
A GOOD RECOVERY BUT THAT COULD BE 
THE END OF BREAK I FEEL 
THAT RED IT REALLY WAS A TERRIFIC 
RECOVERY SHOT I THOUGHT HE WAS OUT 
OF POSITION BUT HE IS SUCH A 
DEVASTATING POTTER THAT IS FAR 
FROM EASY THAT WAS JUDGED TO 
PERFECTION 
THIS TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT HIS 
TEMPERAMENT AS WELL HE WATCHED 
STEPHEN HENDRY MADE THE BREAK OF 
ONE HUNDRED TEN IN THE PREVIOUS FRAME AND THIS 
IS HOW HE HAS RESPONDED 
HE HAS FINISHED A LITTLE AWKWARD 
HERE HE HAS GOT AN EASY BROWN BUT 
A LONG WAY TO TRAVEL WITH THE CUE 
BALL TO GET NICELY ONTO THE RED 
NO PROBLEM WITH CUE POWER BUT THIS 
PLAYER WITH THIS PLAY 
THE KNOWLEDGEABLE CRUCIBLE CROWD 
THEY KNOW THAT HIS PAST THE WINNING 
LINE AND NOW HE STEPS UP A GEAR 
THAT IS PAST THE THING I HAVE BEEN 
IMPRESSED WITH WHEN THE SHOT NEEDS 
A BIT OF DUE CARE AND ATTENTION HE 
WILL SLOW HIS GAME DOWN AND MAKE 
CERTAIN HE DOES NOT MAKE A SILLY 
MISTAKE 
YES HE HAS ONLY BEEN A PRO THREE 
YEARS BUT HE HAS GAINED A TERRIFIC 
AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE IN THAT TIME 
BECAUSE HE HAS PLAYED SO MANY OF 
THE TOP PLAYERS AND HAD SUCCESS 
AGAINST THEM ONCE PAST THE WINNING 
LINE HE CAN PLAY HIS EXHIBITION 
TYPE SNOOKER AN EXHIBITION TYRE 
SHOT THERE TYPE SHOT 
LOOK HOW WE PLAYED TO GET ON THE 
YELLOW HE PLAYED 
ALMOST MADE A CENTURY IN FRAME FOUR 
HE GOT NINETY ONE 
THIS WILL BE HIS THIRD CENTURY AT 
THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE 
FORTY TWO IN HIS CAREER IT DOESN'T MATTER 
WHAT A GREAT RESPONSE FROM MARK 
ALLEN HE SAW STEPHEN HENDRY MAKE A 
BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED TEN WHAT DID HE DO GOES 
STRAIGHT BACK WITH A CENTURY AND 
EXTENDED HIS LEAD 
ON WE GO TO FRAME EIGHT AND MARK 
ALLEN IS EIGHT POINTS BEHIND 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO INTO THE REDS 
FOR ALL FOUR 
HE WENT FULL BALL INTO THEM AND 
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FINISH ON THE 
RED WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE WHITE 
WILL ALWAYS COME BACK THIS WAY HE 
NEEDED TO HIT THAT RED HALF BALL 
I THINK FOR STEPHEN HENDRY EVERY 
FRAME IS A MASSIVE FRAME 
HE COULD DO WITH THIS AND THE LAST 
FRAME TO JUST BE ONE BEHIND 
QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING THAT THIS 
IS A KEY SHOT HE DOESN'T MIND 
GOING INTO THE BUNCH THE WAY THEY 
ARE BECAUSE OF THE RED BY THE 
WHITE HOW MANY CAN HE BRING INTO 
PLAY HERE HE HAS DEVELOPED THE ONE 
BUT HE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE ON 
THIS RED 
HIS PLAN OF ATTACK HERE WOULD BE 
BLACK RED AND THEN PINK AND REDS 
BETTER TO GO INTO THEM DO WHAT THEY 
ARE SITUATED FROM BLUE THAN BLACK 
HAS HE DROPPED ON THAT ONE RIGHT IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE BUNCH IF HE HAS 
FINISHED ON THAT THAT IS BRILLIANT 
AND HE HAS PRECISION PERSONIFIED 
JUST HAVING A LOOK TO SEE IF THERE 
ARE TWO REDS OR A POSSIBLE POT 
INTO THE LEFT MIDDLE A POSSIBLE 
PLANT THERE IS A RED NEAR THE LEFT 
MIDDLE POCKET 
THEY ARE SO CLOSE TOGETHER YOU 
HAVE GOT TO HIT THE FIRST RED FULL 
IN THE FACE BUT HE THINKS IT IS A 
CERTAINTY AND HE WAS RIGHT 
SO NOW EVERY CHANCE TO WIN THIS 
FRAME 
OF COURSE YOU WOULD EXPECT AS 
THEY ALLUDED TO IN THE STUDIO THAT 
CHAMPIONS OF A CERTAIN QUALITY I 
NEVER 
GOING TO GIVE IN ARE NEVER HE WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT HE HAS GOT 
A BAD CONTACT HE HAS GOT A FIFTY SIX 
POINT LEAD BUT IT IS STILL 
POSSIBLE SIXTY SEVEN ON LEFT ON THE TABLE 
HE NEEDS THIS BLACK AND ONE MORE 
RED 
A GOOD SHOT AND THE LEFT IS 
WAITING TO THE LEFT MIDDLE THE 
RED 
WELL THIS COULD BE THE THIRD 
CENTURY IN THREE FRAMES HERE 
THAT CLEARS THE PATH OF FOUR A RED 
INTO THE LEFT CORNER 
THAT WOULD BE A BIT SPECIAL IF WE 
HAD THREE CENTURIES IN A ROW 
WHAT A STRING OF BREAKS WE HAVE 
HAD SEVENTY EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY ONE FORTY NINE ONE HUNDRED TWO FROM MARK 
ALLEN 
WE HAD ONE HUNDRED TEN FROM STEPHEN HENDRY AND 
NOW THIS 
JUST PROVES THE POINT IF 
THE OTHER MAN IS AT THE TABLE 
POTTING BALLS ALL YOU CAN DO IS 
SIT AND WATCH NOTHING YOU CAN DO 
ABOUT IT 
LAST RUN OF THE SESSION COMING UP 
AFTER THIS FRAME LAST FRAME OF 
THE SESSION 
PITY BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
STEPHEN WILL BE SATISFIED 
AND HERE IT IS MARK ALLEN MAKING 
HIS WAY INTO A SIX TO THREE LEAD LOOKING 
REALLY GOOD IN THIS MATCH TWENTY NINE IN 
THE WORLD RANKINGS HE COULD BE 
INTO THE ELITE TOP SIXTEEN NEXT SEASON 
TWENTY TWO YEARS OF AGE WE KNEW HE WAS A 
DECENT PLAYER STEPHEN HENDRY IS IN 
BIG TROUBLE HERE 
THAT WAS A TUTOR 
FRAME THE LAST ONE AGE HUGE 
FRAME THE YOUNG LAD FOR THREE 
YEARS THE WAY THE STANDARDS ARE 
IT IS A FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT 
LET'S PUT IT INTO CONTEXT IT IS 
ALL ABOUT HIS ACHIEVEMENT STEPHEN STEPHEN IS HITTING THE BALL ALL RIGHT THE 
ONE THING YOU FIND IS THAT YOU MISS 
THE ODD STUPID BALL AS YOU GET 
OLDER WHEN HE HAS HE HAS BEEN 
PUNISHED SIX TO THREE IS NOT ALL OVER BUT 
HE DOES HAVE A MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB 
SOMETIMES YOU SENSE THAT STEPHEN 
CAN TRY TOO HARD 
YOU CAN DO IT IS 
ALWAYS A CONFIDENCE THING IF YOU 
CAN WIN A MATCH AND PLAY WELL 
WINNING END MATCH YOU CAN BE UP 
AND RUNNING FIND FORM YOU DIDN'T 
KNOW YOU HAD UNFORTUNATELY FOR 
STEPHEN HE HAS FOUND SOMEONE 
PLAYING VERY VERY WELL 
MARK ALLEN 
IS ONE OF THE NEW FEARLESS BREED 
OF PLAYERS THEY GO OUT AND PLAY 
THE SHOTS THEY HAVE A BIT OF A 
SWAGGER IT IS TERRIFIC 
WHAT I 
SAID THIS AFTERNOON IT THAT'S WHEN 
IT WENT FOUR TO TWO WITH STEPHEN MAKING A 
CENTURY THAT MIGHT MAKE MARK ALLEN 
PINK HE THOUGHT FOR ABOUT THIRTY 
SECONDS AND MADE ONE HUNDRED HIMSELF IN 
THE NEXT FRAME 
WE HAVE SEEN IT 
BEFORE OVERNIGHT THINGS CAN 
CHANGE YOU START THINKING ABOUT IT 
AND IT CAN BE DIFFERENT TOMORROW 
IT CAN BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN 
THE FINAL SESSION 
OF THE MATCH BETWEEN ALI CARTER AND 
BARRY HAWKINS DECIDING WHICH OF 
THE PLAYERS WILL GO THROUGH TO THE 
SECOND ROUND 
THIS IS ALI CARTER'S SIXTH VISIT TO 
THE CRUCIBLE BARRY HAWKINS WAS 
HOPING THIS YEAR WOULD BE THE FIRST 
ROUND THIRD ROUND LUCKY 
ALI CARTER LED SIX TO THREE GOING INTO THE 
FINAL SESSION BUT BARRY IS A 
DETERMINED CHARACTER HE FOUGHT 
BACK TO TRAIL NINETY EIGHT HE IS TWENTY UP IN 
FRAME EIGHTEEN 
WELL THAT WAS BRILLIANT HE HAD TO 
PLAY IT WITH SIDE SPIN AND CARTER 
IS IN REAL TROUBLE HERE 
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT SAME EQUATION 
AS EARLIER IF HE MISSED IT ONCE 
ON DONE THIS HE WOULD HAVE TO GET 
IT SECOND TIME ON THAN THIS THE 
FRAME IS STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE 
NOW JUST DO GREEN NEEDED JUST 
THE GREEN NEEDED 
A TERRIFIC BATTLE THIS CARTER WON 
THE FIRST FRAME OF THE DAY TO LEAD 
SEVEN TO THREE HAWKINS REDUCED THAT TO SEVEN TO SIX 
ALMOST LEVELLED CARTER THEN WENT 
AWAY TO NINETY SIX B. NINETY SIX BUT VERY 
DETERMINED LEE HAWKINS HAS WON 
THREE IN 
A ROW 
SO THIS MATCH WHICH HAS ALREADY 
LASTED SEVEN HOURS TEN MINUTES WILL 
BE DECIDED ON THE SUDDEN DEATH 
SINGLE FRAME SHOOT OUT AFTER THE 
EVENING SESSION ON THIS TABLE AND 
HAWKINS ISN'T TOO PLEASED 
LET'S HEAR FROM THE TOURNAMENT 
DIRECTOR 
IT WAS VERY UNFORTUNATE BUT WE 
HAVE GUIDELINES IN PLACE FOR THIS 
SORT OF SITUATION REGARDLESS OF 
WHAT THE FRAME SCORE IS THEY ARE 
SET IN FORTY MINUTES BEFORE THE NEXT 
SESSION STARTS AS WE ALL KNOW 
FRAMES CAN GO ON AND ON THIS GIVES 
US TIME TO TURN AROUND THE AUDIENCE 
WE COULD HAVE BROADCASTS GOING OUT 
IT ALSO THE PLAYERS IN THE EVENING 
SESSION BASICALLY THEY HAVE 
PREPARED THEMSELVES FOR A SEVEN P. M. START 
THEY COULD HAVE GONE ON UNTIL 
SEVEN THIRTY P. M. WE HAVE AN AUDIENCE TURN 
ROUND OF AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE PEOPLE 
EXPECTED TO COME IN THAT COULD 
HAVE CAUSED PROBLEMS BROADCASTERS 
ARE EXPECTING THE START OF MATCHES 
SO I HAVE SOME DISCRETION IN THE 
MATTER BUT UNFORTUNATELY I THINK 
IT WENT PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN 
RULES ARE RULES YOU CAN SEE IT 
FROM THE PLAYERS' POINT OF VIEW 
AND FROM THE SPECTATORS BOARDED YOU 
IT IS A HORRIBLE SITUATION WHEN I 
WAS AT TWELVE TO TWELVE IT WAS HORRIBLE YOU 
DROP OUT HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT 
THEN THE TABLE IS NOT THE SAME WHEN 
YOU PLAYED ON 
YOU LOSE MOMENTUM 
DON'T YOU 
YOU DO IF YOU ARE BARRY 
HAWKINS YOU HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND 
HE WAS THREE FRAMES DOWN ALI 
CARTER WOULD PROBABLY SAY HE BUT 
LIKE TO GET ON WITH IT BUT IT 
FAVOURS IN A BIT MORE 
THEY COME 
BACK LATER TONIGHT PETER EBDON 
AGAINST A JAMIE COPE PETER EBDON 
HAS MOVED TO DO BY DO YOU THINK IT 
HAS AFFECTED HIS SNOOKER 
I DON'T 
THINK SO L. SAW HIM A COUPLE OF 
BOOKS AGO HE HAS GOT A LOVELY 
SURROUNDINGS WHERE HE IS LIVING 
BUT HE HAS BEEN IN A SNOOKER HALL 
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS PRACTISING 
AS HARD AS HE CAN 
JAMIE COPE IS 
LEADING SEVEN TO FIVE 
HE IS A SERIOUS POTTER 
AND A HEAVY SCORER IF HE GETS A 
BIT BETTER AT THIS SAFETY PLAY HE 
IS GOING TO BE A SERIOUS TOURNAMENT 
WINNER 
YOU KNOW THAT PETER EBDON WINNER IS NOT GOING TO GIVE UP HE'S GOING 
TO FIGHT ON THE CLOSER THE 
YOUNGSTERS GET TO THE FINISHING 
LINE DOES IT AFFECT THEM 
I DON'T 
THINK JAMIE COPE IS BOTHERED HE 
PLAYS THE SAME AGAIN NO MATTER WHAT 
THE SITUATION PETER HAS A BATTLE 
ON HIS HANDS TO LIGHT HE MIGHT 
HAVE TO GOING TO GRIND A MOAT YET YET AGAIN THE STRENGTH IN DEPTH OF 
SNOOKER IS AMAZING 
THIS IS A VERY 
VERY TOUGH TOURNAMENT TO WIN NOW 
THAT IS IT TIME TO GO BUT PRESSED 
THE RED BUTTON YOU CAN SEE THE 
REST OF TONIGHT'S SNOOKER JOE
