FALLEN BY ALMOST A HALF IN THE LAST 
YEAR THE B. B. C. CAN REVEAL THAT THE 
NUMBER OF MORTGAGE LENDERS OFFERING 
COMPETITIVE RATES HAS ALSO DROPPED 
BY TWO THIRDS WE WILL EXAMINE HOW 
THE MORTGAGE SQUEEZE WILL IMPACT ON 
THE HOUSING MARKET IN AUSTRIA NEW 
DETAILS EMERGE ABOUT THE MAN WHO 
KEPT HIS DAUGHTER HIDDEN FOR NEARLY 
QUARTER OF A CENTURY MANY OF THE 
POLES WHO CAME TO BRITAIN IN THE 
LAST THREE YEARS WILL SOON HAVE 
GONE HOME 
JUST ONE DAY OF CAMPAIGNING LEFT 
AS THE MAYORAL HOPEFULS FOR THE 
LONDON MAYOR DRUM UP LAST MINUTE 
SUPPORT SUPPORT SKWHR HISTORIC WIN BY MANCHESTER 
UNITED SETS UP THE FIRST EVER ALL 
ENGLISH CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 
ON B. B. C. LONDON LABOUR M. P. KATE HOEY 
AGREES TO WRK WITH BUDGET WEN 
JIABAO IF HE IS ELECTED MAYOR 
ANGRY PROTESTS BY LORRY DRIVERS 
GOOD EVENING NEW FIGURES TODAY 
SHOW JUST HOW SERIOUS THE SLOW DOWN 
IN THE PROPERTY MARKET HAS BECOME 
MORTGAGE APPROVALS IN MARCH WERE 
NEARLY HALF WHAT THEY WERE THE YEAR 
BEFORE THAT IS A RECORD LOW THE 
B. B. C. HAS LEARNT THAT THE NUMBER OF 
LENDERS ACTIVELY SEEKING TO OFFER 
MORTGAGES WITH TETH COMPETITIVE 
RATES HAS DROPPED BY TWO THIRDS IT 
IS A FURTHER INDICATION OF THE 
SQUEEZE ON HOMEOWNERS AND THOSE 
STILL TRYING TO GET A FOOT ON THE 
PROPERTY LADDER OUR BUSINESS 
EDITOR REPORTS WAS IT REALLY JUST 
NINE MONTHS AGO THAT THE HOUSING 
MARKET WAS SORING AND MORE 
MORTGAGES ON OFFER THAN WE COULD 
USE NOT ANY MORE HOUSE PRICES ARE 
FALLING THERE ARE FAR FEWER 
LENDERS OFFERING COMPETITIVE DEALS 
AND ACCORD TOGETHER LATEST BANK OF 
ENGLAND FIGURES THE NUMBER OF 
MORTGAGE APPROVALS IN MARCH WAS FORTY FOUR PER CENT 
LOWER THAN AL YEAR AGO BACK TO A 
LEVEL NOT SEEN SINCE THE GLOOM OF 
THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES THIS IS THE STORY 
ON EVERY BRITISH HIGH STREET LAST 
YEAR EVERY BANK WAS THROWING MONEY 
AT US TO BUY PROPERTY DEAL AFTER 
DEAL WAS PUT IN THE SHOP WINDOW 
BUT IF YOU WALKED WALK DOWN THE 
SAME HIGH STREETS TODAY THE MESSAGE 
COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT THEY 
DON'T WANT TO LEND TO US THEY WANT 
US TO LEND TO THEM THE MORTGAGE 
ADVERTS HAVE GONE TO BE REPLACED BY 
CLAIMS OF GREAT SAVINGS RATES FOR 
THOSE WHO WILL DEPOSIT PRECIOUS 
CASH THE NUMBER OF SERIOUS LENDERS 
HAVE SHRUNK IN A REMARKABLE WAY 
BOTH THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED 
PROVIDERS OF MORTGAGES A YEAR AGO 
NOW AN ESTIMATED THIRTY ARE OFFERING 
COMPETITIVE MORTGAGE DEALS BUT 
ACCORDING TO MORTGAGE ANALYSTS THE 
SEVEN BIGGEST LENDERS DOMINATE 
THE HOME LOANS MARKET HAS BECOME 
EVEN MORE CONCENTRATED FOR A 
LEADING MORTGAGE BROKER 
SO FAR 
THIS YEAR TWO THIRDS OF OUR 
MORTGAGE BUSINESS HAS GONE TO FIVE 
LENDING GROUPS THAT COMPARES WITH 
THE SAME TIME LAST YEAR WITH ABOUT 
FIFTY SIX PER CENT GOING TO THE TOP FIVE GROUPS 
THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT OUT OF 
THE ONE HUNDRED PLUS LENDERS WE USED LAST 
YEAR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER HAVE 
ACTUALLY JUST STOPPED LENDING THE THE BANK BANS SHORTAGE OF FUNDS WON'T 
BE CURED BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S 
NEW SCHEME TIE LOU BANKS TO SWAP 
THEIR MORTGAGES FOR WASH OR SO 
SAYS THE GOVERNOR 
SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO SO 
CALLED KICK START THE MORTGAGE 
MARKET I THINK IT WOULD A. B. SERIOUS 
MISTAKE TO GO BACK TO WHERE THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET WAS A YEAR AGO 
ONE SIGN OF MORE SOBER TIMES IN THE 
HOUSING MARKET WAS TODAY'S COLLAPSE 
INTO ADMINISTRATION OF AN 
INVESTMENT BUSINESS INSIDE TRACK 
THAT RODE THE BUY TO LET BOOM 
THOSE WHO THINK FALLING HOUSE PRICE 
ARE A BAD THING NOT EVERYONE DOES 
SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THEY DON'T LIVE 
IN AMERICA IN LAS VEGAS HOUSE 
PRICES ARE TWENTY THREE PER CENT DOWN ON A YEAR AGO 
ACCORDING TO FIGURES RELEASED TODAY 
THE DAYS WHEN BUYING A HOUSE WAS A 
SURE BET THEY SEEM TO BE OVER AT 
LEAST FOR A WHILE DO YOU THINK THE 
NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE MORTGAGE 
LENDERS WILL SHRINK FURTHER WE WE HAVE SEEN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY 
CON TRACTION FIONA THE MARKET IS 
NOW DOMINATED BY A HANDFUL OF THE 
BIG BANKS THE NUMBER OF MORTGAGE 
PRODUCT ON OFFER WELL THEY HAVE 
FALLEN ON MOST ESTIMATES BY 
SOMETHING LIKE EIGHTY PER CENT L. THINK THAT IS 
PROBABLE AS BAD AS IT CAN GET ON 
THE OTHER HAND YOU SHOULDN'T 
EXPECT A RETURN TO THE KIND OF BOOM 
CONDITIONS YOU KNOW TIMES OF 
CHEAP PLENTFUL MORTGAGES IF THEY 
DO RETURN WE ARE MONTHS POSSIBLY 
YEARS AWAY FROM THAT NOW LOOK AT 
WHAT OUR LEADING MORTGAGE LENDER 
HBOS SAID TODAY WHEN RAISING FOUR 
BILLION FROM SHAREHOLDERS IT 
EXPECTED THE PROFITABILITY OF 
LENDING MORTGAGES TO RISE 
SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE 
OF YEARS GOOD NEWS OF COURSE FOR 
ITS SHAREHOLDERS THAT PROBABLE 
MEANS FOR CUSTOMERS THAT AS I SAY 
THE PRICE OF MORTGAGES ISN'T COMING 
DOWN NOT QUITE SUCH GOOD NEWS FOR 
PEOPLE IF THEY WANT TO BUY A HOUSE

CLOSE FRIEND AND PASTOR FOR 
COMMENTS WHICH COULD UNDERMINE HIS 
CAMPAIGN REVEREND JEREMIAH WRIGHT 
SAID THAT THE U. S. GOVERNMENT MAY 
HAVE INVENTED THE H. I. V. VIRUS AS A 
WAY TO WIPE OUT ETHNIC MINORITIES 
JUSTIN WEBB IS IN WASHINGTON 
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS IN A 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN WHERE A 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE REALISED HE 
IS BLEEDING AND HE NEEDS TO DO 
SOMETHING DRAMATIC TO STAUNCH THE 
FLOW FLOW LET'S WELCOME OUR BROTHER THE 
REVEREND JEREMIAH WRIGHT 
HE DOES 
LIKE THE LIME LIGHT AND HE WON'T 
SAY SORRY OVER THE WEEKEND THE 
REVEREND JEREMIAH WRIGHT SEEMED TO 
BE ENJOYING HIMSELF WAXING LYRICAL 
ON SUBJECTS FAR REMOVED FROM 
THEOLOGY THEOLOGY IF YOU'VE GOT SOME WHITE FRIENDS 
THEY WILL BE CLAPPING LIKE THIS 
YOU ALL 
YOU SAY THEY CAN'T CLAP YES THEY 
CAN THEY CLAP IN DIFFERENT WAY 
THAT SPEECH WENT DOWN WELL WITH THE 
BLACK AUDIENCE NOT SO WELL WITH 
BARACK OBAMA CAMPAIGN THE FINAL 
STRAW CAME WITH AN APPEARANCE 
YESTERDAY AT THE NATIONAL PRESS 
CLUB IN WASHINGTON 
POLITICIANS SAY 
WHAT THEY SAY AND DO WHAT THEY DO 
BASED ON ELECTABILITY BASED ON 
SOUND BITES BASED ON POLLS WHOR 
IS DOING THE POLLS PREACHERS SAY 
WHAT THEY SAY BECAUSE THEY ARE 
PASTORS I'M NOT RUNNING FOR OFFICE 
I AM OPEN TO BEING VICE PRESIDENT 
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BARACK 
OBAMA IS TRYING TO ATTRACT WHITE 
AND BLACK SUPPORT TOLL SUGGEST THAT 
HIS TEAM IS EVERYONE'S TEAM AND 
THAT HIS TEAM IS DIFFERENT FOR THE 
REVEREND JEREMIAH WRIGHT TO IMPLY 
THAT BARACK OBAMA IS ANOTHER 
POLITICIAN FRIGHTENED OF RACIAL 
TRUTHS THAT WAS TOO MUCH TO TAKE 
I'M OUTRAGED BY THE COMMENTS THAT 
WERE MADE 
SADDENED OVER THE SPECTACLE THAT WE 
SAW YESTERDAY 
IN THE PAST THE BARACK OBAMA LINE 
HAS BEEN THAT HIS FRIEND MADE 
MISTAKES NOW HE SAYS HIS VIEWS ARE 
UNACCEPTABLE 
THEY OFFEND ME THEY UNACCEPTABLE RIGHTLY OFFEND ALL AMERICANS 
AND THEY SHOULD BE DENOUNCED 
THE QUESTION NOW WILL THIS WORK 
WILL REVEREND JEREMIAH WRIGHT 
DISAPPEAR AS AN ISSUE OR COULD HE 
STILL BRING BARACK OBAMA DOWN VERY VERY SOON IN THE INDIANA AND NORTH 
CAROLINA PRIMARIES JUST NEXT WEEK 
CAN HE ATTRACT BACK THE WHITE 
VOTERS HE HAS BEEN LOSING TO 
HILLARY CLINTON FOR BARACK OBAMA 
THE STAKES ARE HIGH 
NEW RESEARCH SUGGEST THAT IS THE 
MASSIVEN INN FLUX OF WORKERS FROM 
EASTERN EUROPE IS FLOWING THE 
OPPOSITE WAY HALF OF THE MILLION 
MIGRANTS WHO ARRIVED SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
HAVE RETURNED HOME THAT FIGURE IS 
EXPECTED TO RISE MANY BUSINESSS 
ARE WORRYING ABOUT HOW THEY WILL BE 
ABLE TO FILL THEIR VACANCIES IN 
TOWNS LIKE THIS IN THE HEART OF 
SCOTLAND THEY WORRY ABOUT 
IMMIGRATION IMMIGRATION NOT THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY 
MIGRANTS BUT THAT THERE IS NOT 
ENOUGH THIS IS A TOWN WHOSE ENTIRE 
ECONOMY HAS BECOME RELIANT ON THE 
OTHER HAND EAST EUROPEAN WORKERS 
AT THE SCOTLAND'S HOTEL BREAKFAST 
IS COOKED BY A POLE 
SERVED BY HUNGARIAN 
THE BEDROOMS ARE CLEANED BY YOUNG 
CZECHS BUT NOW THERE ARE SIGNS THAT 
THE SUPPLY OF MIGRANT LABOUR IS 
DRYING UP ARE YOU GOING TO STAY 
HERE FOR A WHILE 
YES FOR A WHILE 
BUT NOT FOR LONG I WANT TO GO TO 
ANOTHER COUNTRY

IPPR HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAKE SENSE 
OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AS WELL AS 
HOLDING POLISH HE FOCUS GROUPS AND 
SURVEYS THEY ANALYSED U. K. DATA WITH 
GUIDANCE FROM EXPERT STAT TISTS 
THEIR CONCLUSION 
BACK IN PERTHSHIRE A PARTY OF SLOW

EUROPEAN TWANGE 
WELCOME EVERYBODY

RIGHT NOW NO NO NOT AT ALL NOW THERE JUST ISN'T THE LOCAL 
POPULATION 
TEN YEAR OLD SCOTCH POPULATION MALT IS BOTTLED BY POLES HERE FOR 
THE MONEY AND HOW THE ECONOMICS ARE 
CHANGING AS THE BRITISH ECONOMY 
SLOWS DOWN POLAND ARE SEEING RAPID 
GROWTH OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 
WHO HAVE RESTRICTED MIGRANT WORKERS 
ARE NOW OPENING THEIR DOORS THE 
WEAK POUND AGAINST CURRENCIES LIKE 
THE POLISH CURRENCY MEANS PAY RATES 
HERE ARE MUCH LESS ATTRACTIVE A FEW 
MILES DOWN THE ROAD EASTERN 
EUROPEAN MIGRANTS TENDING A BLUE 
BERRY CROP HAVE DONE 
THE MATHS NOW NOW THE POUND IS VERY LOW AND PEOPLE 
DON'T WANT TO COME TO SCOTLAND IT IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY ANY MORE NO NO IF THE ECONOMICS ARE CHANGING SO 
ARE THE POLITICS CONCERNS THAT 
UNEXPECTEDLY RAPID MIGRATION IS 
STRAINING PUBLIC SERVICES AND 
SOCIAL COHESION HAS SEEN GOVERNMENT 
CUTS TO SEASONAL WORKERS ALLOWED

SLASH OCTOBER 
FRUIT ROTTING IN THE SLASH OCTOBER FIELDS 
IT WOULD BE IF WE CAN'T FIELDS PICK IT 
THERE MAY BE POLITICAL 
ARGUMENTS FOR FEWER MIGRANTS THERE 
ARE ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS FOR MORE IF 
THE EAST EUROPEANS GO AS QUICKLY AS 
THEY CAME THERE COULD BE SERIOUS 
CONSEQUENCES FOR SCOTLAND AND 
BEYOND

OTHER OTHER BORIS JOHNSON IS BIG ON PERSONALITY
