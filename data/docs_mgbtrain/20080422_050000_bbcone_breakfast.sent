WATCHDOG OUTLINES THEIR THINKING 
TODAY TODAY COLOURFUL OUTSPOKEN AND NECK AND 
NECK IT IS KEN VERSUS BORIS FOR

FILM AND BEING TREATED FOR SKIN 
CANCER CANCER GOOD MORNING 
THE CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING 
IS TO MEET MORTGAGE LENDERS TODAY 
TO URGE THEM TO DO MORE TO HELP 
STRUGGLING BORROWERS 
HE WANTS TO HELP FIND WAYS WHO 
CAN'T MAKE THEIR REPAYMENTS 
IT IS HARD TO SMILE WHEN READING A 
MORTGAGE OFFER THESE DAYS AND 
NADIA IS FAR FROM ALONE SHE CAN 
ONLY AFFORD THE MORALITY PAYMENTS 
ON HER NEW HOME IN SHE JUST PAYS 
OFF THE INTEREST IT MEANS THE 
AMOUNT SHE OWES ISN'T GOING DOWN 
AND RECENT FALLS IN THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND BASE RATE HAVEN'T HELPED 
WELL IT WAS DISAPPOINTING THAT THE 
LENDERS CAN'T GIVE US THE REDUCED 
RATE THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAVE NOW 
MADE RECENTLY MADE BECAUSE IT WOULD 
BENEFIT US ME AS A HOME OWNER 
SWITCHING TO A REPAYMENT MORTGAGE 
RATHER THAN THAN INTEREST ONLY 
OTHER BORROWERS ARE WORSE OFF 
UNABLE TO GET AN AN AFFORDABLE 
MORTGAGE AT ALL TODAY LENDERS WILL 
COME UNDER PRESSURE TO HELP THEM 
OUT THE CHANCELLOR IS MEETING 
BLANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES TO 
DISCUSS HOW THEY CAN PASS ON THE 
BENEFITS OF FALLING INTEREST RATES 
THE DAY DAY AFTER THEY WERE GIVING 
A HAND THEMSELVES WITH THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND'S FIFTY BILLION PLAN TO HELP 
LENDERS ARE SWAP MORTGAGE DEBT FOR 
GOVERNMENT BONDS BUT IT SEEMS 
BERATES FOR CONSUMERS ARE FAR FROM 
GUARANTEED GUARANTEED IT IS NOT PART OF THE DEAL THAT 
THEY MUST BE PASSED ON MOST OF THE 
LENDERS BASED THEM ON IN BASE RATE 
CUTS THEY HAVE EMPHASISED TO THE 
CHANCELLOR BEFORE THAT THE COST OF 
FUNDS AREN'T LINKED TO THE BASE 
RATE ALONE AND IT IS NOT A SIMPLE 
DECISION DECISION THE ADVICE FOR ANYONE STRUGGLING 
WITH THEIR MORTGAGE IS TO CONTACT 
THEIR LENDER AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN 
LIKE THATIA THEY MAYBE ABLE TO FIND 
A WAY TO REDUCE THEIR PAYMENTS 
WITHOUT FALLING INTO ARREARS THE CHANCELLOR WILL 
TO AVERT A 
BACKBENCH REVOLT OVER THE TWENTY FIVE PENCE 
TAX RATE 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS PROMISED A 
REVIEW TO HELP THOSE WHO WILL LOSE 
OUT OUT IN THE NEXT HOUR THE ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND WILL GIVE DETAILS OF ITS 
PLAN TO RAISE UP TO TWELVE BILLION IT 
IS TRYING TO GET THE MONEY THROUGH 
A RIGHTS ISSUE BY GOING TO ITS 
EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS AND ASKING 
FOR MORE CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR NEW 
SHARES IT MAY SELL OFF SOME ASSETS 
DECLAN WILL HAVE MORE ON THAT AT 
SEVEN ZERO ZERO A M. THE CHANGE IN THE LAW IS 
BEING CONSIDERED TO TAKE IT EASIER 
FOR PEOPLE TO MARRY IN CHURCH 
ANGLIAN CHURCH RULES SAY YOU MUST 
ATTEND THE CHURCH REGULARLY TO GET 
MARRIED THERE 
THIS CHURCH LOOKS LIKE A FILM SET 
AND HAS BEEN USED AS ONE THE RULES 
SAY YOU MUST LIVE IN THE PARISH OR 
ATTEND THE CHURCH REGULARLY AND THE 
VICAR'S STRICT INTERPRETATION HAS 
HELPED SOME BELIEVE WEDDING 
TOURISM SHOULD BE RESISTED 
PEOPLE COME FOR THE RIGHT REASONS 
IT IS A PEACEFUL CHURCH AND TO 
COME BECAUSE IT LOOKS PRETTY IS 
ALMOST BLASPHEMOUS 
RELIGIOUS MARRIAGES ARE IN DECLINE 
THE CLING IS LOSING THE CHURCH OF 
ENGLAND IS LOSING ITS SHARE 
CONFIRMATION IS EXPECTED OF A 
RELAXATION IN THE RULES FROM THE 
AUTUMN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MARRY IN 
ANY PARISH IF YOU LIVED THERE FOR 
SIX MONTHS IF YOUR PARENTS LIVE 
LIVE THERE OR IF YOUR GRANDPARENTS 
WERE MARRIED THERE IT WILL 
INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON THE 
PRETTIEST PARISHES ARE BUT THE 
CHURCH SAYS IT SHOULD HELP PUT 
RELIGION BACK INTO MARRIAGE 
WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THAT LATER 
TALKS ARE PLANNED TO PREVENT A 
STRIKE TAKING PLACE AT THE THE 
GRANGEMOUTH OIL REFINERY 
MANAGEMENT ARE CONTINUING TO SHUT 
DOWN THE SITE AS A PRECAUTION 
A DRUG FOR TREATING CANCER HAS BEEN 
LENGTHED TO BRAIN DAMAGE IN MICE 
THE DRUG IS OFTEN USED AS PART OF A 
COCKTAIL OF DRUGS TO TREAT BREAST 
STOMACH AND PANCREATIC CANCER 
DEMOCRATS IN PENNSYLVANIA GO TO THE 
POLLS LATER IN THE BITTER FIGHT 
BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND BARACK 
OBAMA OBAMA IT IS THE LAST THE BIG STATES TO 
HOLD AL PRIMARY AND HILLARY CLINTON 
WILL NEED A CONVINCING VICTORY IF 
SHE IS TO STAY IN THE RACE FOR THE 
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION 
PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
COULD BE BANNED FROM DRIVING AT 
NIGHT IT IS PART OF A RANGE OF 
PLANS BEING DELATED IN THE ASSEMBLY 
TO CUT ROAD DEATHS 
CRASHES DON'T DISCRIMINATE VICTIMS 
CAN BE ANY ANY AGE BUT THERE IS 
CONCERN ABOUT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG 
PEOPLE KILLED IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS 
EVERY YEAR 
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY WARNINGS AND 
CAMPAIGNS NOW THERE ARE SOME WHO 
BELIEVE IT IS TIME TO PUT FURTHER 
RESTRICTIONS ON NEWLY QUALIFIED 
DRIVERS AND AS ONE OF ONE 
STORMONT'S YOUNGEST POLITICIANS ARE 
PUTTING FORWARD THE PROPOSAL 
WHAT I WOULD BE HAPPY IF IF I WAS A 
PARENT OR A SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD IN 
FIVE YEARS TIME WHEN THEY KNOW THEY 
ARE SAFE AND THEIR FRIENDS ARE WITH 
THEM THEY WILL REALISE THE MERITS 
IN THE SCHEME 
THE MOTION CALLS FOR 
A TOTAL ALCOHOL BAN FOR NEWLY 
QUALIFIED DRIVERS A CURFEW THAT 
WOULD STOP MOTORISTS DRIVING AT 
NIGHT AND A BAN ON THEM CARRYING 
TEENAGE PASSENGERS THERE ARE 
HOWEVER MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO FEEL 
THE IDEAS WOULDN'T WORK 
IT IS NOT PRACTICAL IF YOU'RE SEVENTEEN 
LIKE ALL YOUR FRIENDS WILL BE THE 
SAME AGE SO YOU ARE GOING AROUND ON 
YOUR OWN WITH OVER TWENTY YEAR OLDS YOU 
KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKEMENT I DON'T 
THINK IT IS PRACTICAL 
JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE YOUNG AND 
INEXPERIENCED DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE 
A BAD DRIVER 
SIMILAR SCHEMES OPERATE IN OTHER 
PARTS OF THE WORLD AND IT IS 
CLAIMED THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL 
IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS 
VOFG TEENAGE INVOLVING TEENAGE 
DRIVERS DRIVERS THE U. K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY GAINED 
ITS FIRST MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT 
AFTER A FORMER CONSERVATIVE M. P. 
AGREED TO JOIN THE PARTY NINE DAYS 
BEFORE THE LOCAL ELECTIONS BOB 
SPINK WAS EXPELLED FROM THE PARTY 
LAST MONTH AFTER FALLING OUT WITH 
THE LEADERSHIP OVER DIFFICULTIES IN 
HIS CONSTITUENCY

LONDON FOR THE OLYMPICS IS FACING 
CRITICISM M. P.'S ON THE PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE CALLED THE 
ORIGINAL ESTIMATES UNREALISTIC AND 
ACCUSED MINISTERS OF WISHFUL 
THINKING THE GOVERNMENT INITIALLY 
SAID THE GAMES WOULD COST OVER FOUR 
BILLION AND THAT'S RISEN TO NINE POINT THREE 
BILLION BILLION THEY HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN THE 
ORIGINAL BUDGET BY APPEARS TO BE 
STAB IN THE DARK MISSING OUT MANY 
FACTORS MISSING OUT VAT AND 
SECURITY THAT SHOULD OF BEEN 
INCLUDED I AM MORE CONFIDENT THAT 
THE REVISED BUDGET IS MORE ROBUST

ALL IN THE MIND 
HOW 
GET AROUND THAT THE 
NEXT TIME THERE IS PENALTY SHOOTOUT SHOOTOUT YOU SAY WE WILL WIN THE PENALTY 
SHOOTOUT 
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THIS MORNING 
HAS A PICTURE OF SURVEILLANCE 
IMAGES OF TWO OF THE JULY SEVENTH 
SUICIDE BOMBERS MEETING A MAN 
SUSPECTED OF HELPING THEM CARRY OUT 
THE ATTACKS THEY WERE SHOWN TO THE

DOCTORS WHO CARRIED OUT SURGERY TO 
RESTORE THE EYESIGHT OF TWO BLIND 
PATIENTS AND THEY HAVE GIVEN THEM A 
BIONIC EYE WHICH ENABLES THEM TO 
THEIR FAMILIES FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN YEARS WE DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER THIS HAS WORKED 
SUCCESSFULLY FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF 
DAYS THERE ARE HOPES THIS WILL 
PAVE THE WAY FOR THE TREATMENT TO 
BECOME AVAILABLE FOR MILLIONS OF 
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD 
YOU EXPECT TO SEE GUARDS MEN 
FAINTING AND COLLAPSING YOU DON'T 
EXPECT TO SEE SOLDIERS FALLING OFF 
THEIR HORSES 
THAT HAPPENED TO A YOUNG FEMALE 
GUNNER TAKING A FALL FROM HER HORSE 
THIS IN THE SUN THIS MORNING HOW 
MUCH DO YOU THINK THE TREES IN YOUR 
GARDEN ARE WORTH 
WELL A SINGLE OLD TREE A 
VICTORIAN PLAIN HAS BEEN VALUED AT 
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IT WAS NAMED AS THE MOST 
MOST VALUABLE STREET TREE UNDER 
SCHEME WHICH SAYS IT IS BRANCHING 
OUT ACROSS BRITAIN WE HAVE HEARD 
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT PLAIN TREES ARE 
IT IS ON A STREET 
VICTORIAN PLAIN TREES ARE IMPORTANT

TOLD YOU WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR 
RBS TELL US HOW MUCH MONEY IT IS

GO FROM ONE OF THE MAJOR BANK WITH 
ONE OF THE THINNEST FINANCIAL 
CUSHIONS TO GET THROUGH THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH TO BECOMING A BANK WITH ONE 
OF THE FATTEST FINANCIAL CUSHIONS 
SO WE THINK THAT WILL TAKE 
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE 
BILLION WE ARE WATCHING OUT FOR A 
POSSIBLE SALE OF ITS BUSINESSES IT 
OWNS DIRECT LINE PERHAPS THAT 
MIGHT BE PUT PUT UP FOR SALE WILL 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE BE ABLE TO KEEP 
HIS JOB HE HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE

THE HOUR IF THE COMPANY THAT OWNS 
HEATHROW IS GOING TO BE BROKEN UP 
B. A. A. ALSO OWNS GATWICK STANSTEAD 
GLASGOW EDINBURGH ABERDEEN AND

OBAMA ARE SLUGGING IT OUT IN 
PENNSYLVANIA TODAY OH IT IS THEM 
IN THE LAST LEG OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 
CONTEST THAT IS HER OUCH SORRY 
THAT WAS A BIT OF A SURPRISE ALSO 
COMING UP IN THE PROGRAMME WHY 
SHOULD WE CARE WHO BECOMES LONDON 
MAYOR JULIA GEORGE HAS BEEN 
FINDING OUT 
LONDON DRIVES OUR ECONOMIC DESTINY 
IT IS A CULTURAL POWER HOUSE AND 
IDEAS HERE ARE OFTEN ROLLED OUT 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ADD TO THAT A 
NECK AND NECK RACE WITH COLOURFUL 
CHARACTERS AND BELIEVE ME THIS IS 
A ELECTION WORTH WATCHING MAYBE 
MAYBE THEY SHOULD GET KEN AND BORIS TO 
HAVE AN ELECTRONIC WRESTLING MATCH 
AS WELL 
DID THAT TAKE YOU BY 
SURPRISE TOO 
TOTALLY TOTALLY LET'S FIND OUT ABOUT THE WEATHER 
GOOD MORNING TO THE BLOSSOM IS OUT 
HERE AND THE BIRDS ARE SINGING AND 
ONCE THE SUN COMES OUT TODAY YOU 
WILL FEEL PLEASANTLY SURPRISED IT 
WILL FEEL LIKE SPRING THERE WILL 
BE A LITTLE CLOUD AROUND IT WON'T 
BE A STORY OF CRYSTAL BLUE SKIES 
AROUND BUT THE CLOUD IS HIGH BASED 
BUT IT WILL WEAKEN THE SUNSHINE AT 
FIRST AND THERE IS MISTY LOW CLOUD 
ACROSS THE MIDLANDS CENTRAL 
ENGLAND AND PARTS OF SCOTLAND BUT 
IT WILL THIN AND BREAK AND IT WILL 
TURN A LOT BRIGHTER IN THE 
AFTERNOON IN SCOTLAND A BRIGHTER 
AFTERNOON IN WEERN AREAS BUT 
ALWAYS BREEZE AROUND WESTERN 
AREAS BUT ALWAYS BREEZE AROUND 
AND IT WILL FEEL CHILLY ON THE 
COASTS COASTS THERE IS STILL THE WIND COMING OFF 
THE NORTH SEA FOR TIME BEING SO 
TEMPERATURES ALONG THE COASTLINE OF 
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WILL BE THIRTEEN 
DEGREES BUT ELSE IT REALLY WILL 
BE A PLEASANT AFTERNOON A SEA 
BREEZE DEVELOPING FROM THE ISLE OF 
WIGHT DOWN TOWARDS THE COASTS MUCH 
DEVON AND OVER WALES BIT MORE 
CLOUD WILL START TO GATHER AND MORE 
CLOUD WILL PUSH INTO WESTERN PARTS 
OF NORTHERN IRELAND BUT FOR THE 
REST OF THE COUNTRY IT SHOULD STAY 
DRY BUT THINGS CHANGE DURING THIS 
COMING NIGHT THERE WILL BE RAIN ON 
THE WESTERN FRINGES OF WALES AND 
THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND THE 
WEST OF SCOTLAND AND OVER NORTHERN 
IRELAND SO TOMORROW IT COULD BE 
A WET START TO THE DAY ALONG THE 
WEST OF SCOTLAND AND THE MIDLANDS 
AND THE SOUTH EAST BUT THE RAIN 
WILL CLEAR AWAY AND TEMPERATURES 
COULD PEAK AT EIGHTEEN CELSIUS WE'VE 
HEARD THE NEWS THIS MORNING THAT 
DRIVERS IN NORTHERN IRELAND UNDER 
TWENTY COULD BE BANNED FROM DRIVING AT 
NIGHT OR FROM CARRYING OTHER 
PASSENGERS IT IS ONLY A PROPOSAL 
AT THE MOMENT BUT LET'S HEAR FROM 
OUR CORRESPONDENT CHRIS HOW WOULD 
IT WORK IF THIS GETS THROUGH GOOD GOOD MORNING BEHIND ME IS A VERY BUSY 
ROAD ON WHICH THERE HAVE BEEN 
SEVERAL ACCIDENTS EYE SO THEY HAVE 
PUT UP SPEED CAMERAS BUT ROAD 
SAFETY CAMPAIGNERS WANT TO GO 
FURTHER WHEN YOU ARE A LEARNER 
YOU HAVE TO DISPLAY AN L. PLATE BUT 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND WHEN YOU HAVE 
PASSED YOUR TEST YOU STILL HAVE TO 
PUT UP AN R. PLATE AND YOU ARE NOT 
ALLOWED TO DRIVE OVER FORTY FIVE MILES AN 
HOUR FOR A YEAR BUT SOME 
CAMPAIGNERS WANT TO GO FURTHER AND 
HAVE A BAN ON NIGHT TIME DRIVING 
AND THE CARRYING OF OTHER 
PASSENGERS BUT THEY ARE FOCUSING 
ON TEENAGE DRIVERS IN THE ALL 
IMPORTANT EFFORT TO SAVE LIVES 
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING 
POLITICAL CONTESTS IN YEARS THE 
PRIZE THE TOP JOB IN LONDON WITH 
THE POWER TO CHANGE THE LIVES OF 
MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE 
EVEN IF YOU LIVE OUTSIDE THE 
CAPITAL YOU SHOULD STILL CARE 
ABOUT WHO THE MAYOR OF LONDON IS 
AND JULIA GEORGE CAN TELL US WHY 
GOOD MORNING POLITICIANS 
BROADCASTERS ANALYSTS FOR YEARS 
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THAT 
WINNING FORMULA THAT MAKES POLITICS 
INTERESTING AGAIN AND THEN 
SUDDENLY IT JUST HAPPENS 
SPONTANEOUSLY AND FOR ANYONE WITH 
HALF AN EYE ON THE CITY THERE ARE 
THREE COLOURFUL CHARACTERS WHO 
REFUSE TO TOW THE LINE AND SPEAK 
THEIR MIND AND IT HAS NOW BECOME A 
MAYORAL ELECTION WORTH WATCHING 
IT HAS THE MAKINGS OF A GREAT SHOW 
THE BACKDROPS ARE STUNNING THE 
CHARACTERS LARGER THAN LIFE IN 
LONDON'S LATEST POWER STRUGGLE 
THESE ARE THE THREE MAIN PLAYERS 
IT IS A RACE TO RUN A WORLD CLASS 
CITY BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS SUCH A 
PRESTIGIOUS JOB 
THE JAYOR HAS ACQUIRED NEW POWERS 
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SO IT IS 
NOW A MAJOR JOB IN CITY POLITICS 
INDEED IT IS COMPARABLE TO SOME OF 
THE BIG MAYORAL JOBS ACROSS THE 
WORLD LONDON AND PARIS 
BUT WHAT 
IF YOU DON'T LIVE OR WORK IN 
LONDON DO THE POLITICAL FORTUNES 
OF THIS CITY STILL MATTER THERE 
ARE ISSUES THAT AFFECT THE WHOLE 
COUNTRY NOT LEAST THE ECONOMY 
LONDON GENERATES ONE FIFTH OF OUR 
ANNUAL WEALTH AND THE MAYOR HAS A 
AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF NINE BILLION 
WHAT HAPPENS IN LONDON IS CLOSELY 
WATCHED ACROSS THE COUNTRY LOOK 
OUT FOR ROAD PRICING IN A TOWN NEAR 
YOU YOU A WORLD CITY MUST ALSO THRIVE IN 
THE GLARE OF INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY 
IN FOUR YEARS' TIME THE SPRAWLING 
SITE BELOW ME WILL BE OF BSH WILL 
BE THE ONE OF BRITAIN THAT BOUNCES 
AROUND THE GLOBE WITH THE OLYMPICS 
NO PRESSURE THEN DESPITE THE HUGE 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE NEXT 
LONDON MAYOR WHAT EVERYONE IS 
REALLY TALKING ABOUT ARE THE 
CHARACTERS 
BORIS AND KEN ARE LIKE CHARACTERS AN OLD COMEDY DUO WHO HATE EACH 
OTHER IN REAL LIFE AND HAVE TO 
PRETEND ON THE STAGE BUT IN FACT 
IT IS THE OTHER WAY AROUND IN REAL 
LIFE THEY LIKE EACH OTHER AND IN 
POLITICS THEY'RE SPITTING AT EACH 
OTHER 
WHAT ABOUT BRIAN PADDICK OTHER YES HE COULD DECIDE THE ELECTION 
VERY STIFF AND STRAIGHT 
AND AFTER 
THE RACE A GLITTERING PRIZE BUT 
THE RESULT IS FAR FROM CERTAIN 
THE MOST RECENT POLLS HAVE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE AND BORIS JOHN STON 
NECK AND NECK THEY WERE IN THE 
EVENING STANDARD AND THE SUNDAY 
TIMES IN THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS 
AND THEY PUT THE LEADING CANDIDATES 
BETWEEN ONE AND SIX POINTS APART 
AND IT GETS LITTLE TIGHTER WHEN 
YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SECOND 
PREFERENCE BECAUSE EVERYONE GETS 
TO VOTE FOR TWO CANDIDATES A FIRST 
CHOICE AND A SECOND CHOICE AND IF 
NOBODY GETS AN OVERALL MAJORITY OF 
THE VOTE THE VOTES FOR THE SECOND 
CANDIDATE COME INTO PLAY AND WHY 
AM I STANDING HERE THIS IS WHAT 
EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT WHEN THEY TALK 
ABOUT LONDON THE CONGESTION CHARGE 
IT COULD BE SEEN AS A DECIDING 
POLICY ON KEN LIVINGSTONE'S ISSUES 
AND THERE HAS BEEN A HORRENDOUS 
INCREASE IN TEENAGE CRIME IN LONDON 
OVER THE PAST YEARS SO THAT IS 
ANOTHER BIG ISSUE BUT IT COULD BE 
SEEN AS GIVING THE INCUMBENT PARTY 
IN LONDON IN WESTMINSTER BLOODY 
NOSE WITH THE RESULTS BUT THE 
ISSUE REALLY IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL 
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE CANDIDATES FOR 
THE LONDON MAYORAL ELECTIONS BY 
GOING TO THIS WEBSITE STILL TO 
COME 
I HAVE ENJOYED THIS STRANGE COME TIME FRAME L. L. WAS LIVING ALONE IN 
NEW YORK AND I WOULD BE GETTING UP 
AT ONE AND HAVING MY BREAKFAST AT 
ONE POINT THREE OH IN THE AFTERNOON AND MY LUNCH 
AT EIGHT 
WE WILL FIND OUT WHY EUAN 
MCGREGOR'S WORLD WAS TURNED UPSIDE 
DOWN IN HIS LATEST FILM DECEPTION 
BUT NOW THE LOCAL NEWS WHERE YOU 
ARE 
GOOD MORNING FROM B. B. C. LONDON NEWS 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
MEETING TO PROTEST AGAINST PLANS TO 
CHANGE FLIGHT PATHS NORTH OF LONDON 
THE NATIONAL AIR TRAFFIC SERVICE 
SAYS ITS PROPOSALS TO CHANGE FORTY 
ROUTES ACROSS EAST ANGLIA WILL 
REDUCE AIR TRAFFIC CONGESTION OVER 
TOWNS BUT IT ADMITS THAT THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE LIVING NEAR LUTON AIRPORT 
WILL SUFFER MORE NOISE 
DESPITE THE 
FACT THAT ELSEWHERE THEY'RE TRYING 
TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
COVERED AND CLAIM THEY CAN REDUCE 
IT BY TEN PER CENT SO OVER THE WHOLE REGION 
IT WILL BE REDUCED BY TEN PER CENT BUT HERE 
IN LUTON THERE ARE THREE TIMES MORE 
PEOPLE WHO WILL BE AFFECTED THE THE FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF 
STEPHEN LAWRENCE WILL BE MARKED 
WITH A MEMORIAL SERVICE IN LONDON 
TODAY NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN 
CONVICTED OF HIS MURDER THE 
SERVICE WILL TAKE PLACE AT SAINT 
MARTIN IN THE FIELDS CHURCH 
A GROUP OF M. P.'S HAVE LAUNCHED A 
SCATHING ATTACK ON THE RISING COSTS 
OF STAGING THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS THEY 
SAY THAT ORIGINAL ESTIMATES WERE 
ENTIRELY UNREALISTIC AND EXPRESS 
LITTLE CONFIDENCE THAT THE NEW 
BUDGET OF NINE POINT THREE BILLION WILL NOT BE 
EXCEEDED NOW THE TRAVEL NEWS THERE ARE MINOR DELAYS FOR THE 
PICCADILLY LINE CAUSED BY 
ENGINEERING WORKS WHICH HAVE 
OVERRUN ON THE ROADS IT IS QUITE 
QUIET THIS IS THE A TWENTY SIDCUP ROAD 
WHERE IT IS A LITTLE BUSY BUT 
NOTHING TOO MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT 
AND A REALLY UNUSUAL START FOR THE 
BLACKWALL TUNNEL TRAFFIC IS 
ZOOMING BY SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS

CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE SEMI FINAL THE

LONG SPELLS OF SUNSHINE IT COULD 
FEEL A BIT CHILLY IN THE BREEZE 
AROUND THE THAMES ESTUARY BUT MOST 
OF US WILL SEE TEMPERATURES OF SEVENTEEN 
OR EIGHTEEN DEGREES THIS EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT CLEAR SPELLS AT FIRST 
BUT DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE 
NIGHT CLOUD WILL SPREAD IN FROM THE 
WEST BRINGING OUTBREAKS OF RAIN TO 
WESTERN AREAS AND THAT RAIN WILL

MATCHES MATCHES IF IT WAS PERCEIVED TO BE BETTER 
THAN WHAT WE HAVE GOT THERE IS NOT 
A PROBLEM WITH THAT IF YOU WANT TO 
USE IT FOR A DIFFERENT COMPETITION

SPONSORS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT THING 
AND IF THIS WORKS AS WELL AS THE 
RED BALL AND PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO 
THAT FINE 
HERE IT IS THAT'S THE 
BALL

FROM NEW YORK FASHION TO A NEW DELI 
FACTORY SIX BRITISH YOUNGSTERS 
FOLLOWED THEIR FASHION ADDICTIONS 
BACK TO THE FIRS STITCH AND THE 
TRANSFORMATION IS SEAMLESS 
BLOOD SWEAT AND T. SHIRTS FOLLOWS 
THE GROUP GROUP 
WE WILL SPEAK TO TWO OF THE GIRLS 
LET'S SEE GEORGINA LEARNING THE 
FACTORY RULES 
IF YOU WANT ANYTHING IF YOU WANT 
TO SHOW YOUR HAND LIKE THIS 
AFTER MY HELPER MY ASSISTANT WILL 
COME HERE AND WHATEVER YOU NEED 
SHE WILL FULFIL FOR YOU 
NO ONE TOLD ME THAT 
NO ONE TOLD ME 
WHAT 
NO ONE TOLD ME WHAT THAT'S WHAT I'M TELLING YOU O. K. 
LOOK AT THAT SULLEN LOOK FROM 
GEORGINA GEORGINA GEORGINA BRIERS AND TARA SCOTT ARE 
WITH US 
YOU HAVE TAKEN TO A DISGUISE YOU 
CHANGED YOUR HAIR COLOUR SINCE THAT 
WAS FILMED 
YES I HAVE GONE BACK 
TO MY ROOTS 
IT WAS ANKS TRODRY PROGRAMME 
EXTRAORDINARY PROGRAMME AND MOST 
PEOPLE WOULD THINK THESE KIDS ARE A 
BIT SPOILED THEY HAVE MONEY THEY 
BUY CLOTHES THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE 
IT COMES FROM THEY BUY DISPOSABLE 
FASHION WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING 
WHEN YOU WENT OUT THERE 
I THINK I 
WAS EXPECTING IT WAS GOING TO BE A 
HOLIDAY REALLY L. DON'T THINK I 
KNEW THE FULL EXTENT OF WHAT WE 
WERE GOING TO BE DOING L. L. THOUGHT 
IT WAS GOING TO BE CHICKEN KORMAS 
AND SANDY BEACHES BUT IT WASN'T AT 
ALL ALL YOU WORKED IN SO FAR WE HAVE SEEN 
YOU WORKING IN A GOOD FACTORY WHERE 
IT WAS HARD WORK THEN YOU WENT TO 
A SWEAT SHOP WHERE IT WAS HORRIBLE 
AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU WERE 
STAYING IN WHAT WE SHOULD CALL 
HUMBLE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH INDIAN 
FAMILIES SO IT WASN'T EASY 
NO IT WAS A REAL CHALLENGE AND 
MADE BEING TAKEN OUT OF YOUR 
COMFORT ZONE MADE EVERYTHING SO 
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT I THINK 
THIS IS IS WHERE YOU DISCOVERED THE 
TOILET FACILITIES AND THE SHOWER 
FACILITIES WHERE YOU WERE GOING TO 
STAY THIS FAMILY WHICH HAD LITTLE 
MONEY WERE STAYING IN TWO ROOMS 
WAS IT 
YEAH THERE WAS TWO ROOMS 
THERE WAS ONE ON THE GROUND GROUND 
FLOOR AND THEY HAD AN UPSTAIRS 
WHICH WAS ANOTHER ROOM BUT THERE 
WAS SIX PEOPLE IN ONE ROOM THEY 
DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY SO 
OBVIOUSLY FOR US TO GO IN THERE IT 
IS NOTHING LIKE WE HAD EXPECTED 
BEFORE IT WAS JUST REALLY BASIC 
YOU HAVE GOT TO MAINTAIN YOUR 
RESPECT FOR THE FAMILY BECAUSE THEY 
ARE INVITING YOU IN AND LOOKING 
AFTER YOU WHEN THEY HAVE MINIMUMAL 
RESOURCES WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST 
SHOCK TARA 
I THINK IT WAS JUST THE HOLE THING 
WAS JUST SO OVERWHELMING THAT I I 
COULDN'T PICK ANYTHING OUT IT WAS 
SO DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING WE ARE 
USED TO HERE THE LIVING CONDITIONS 
WORKING WORKING HOURS THE TYPE OF 
WORK EVERYTHING WAS JUST LIKE SO 
KIND OF PHYSICALLY AND EMOTION 
EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTING 
I AM SURE THERE IS LOTS OF TEARS 
SHED SHED THE POINT OF GOING WAS FOR YOU TO 
APPRECIATE WHERE YOUR CLOTHES CAME 
FROM AND THERE ARE SIX OF YOU I 
KNOW COUPLE OF SAYING I CAN BUY A 
T. SHIRT FOR A ONE AND WEAR IT A 
COUPLE OF TIMES AND THROW IT AWAY 
NOT KNOWING THAT THAT T. SHIRT WAS 
MADE IN A SWEAT SHOP BY SOMEBODY 
WHO IS ONLY EARNING ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE OH A 
DAY HAS IT CHANGED YOUR PERCEPTION 
OF CHEAP CLOTHING 
DEFINITELY L. 
MEAN BEFORE AS FAR AS I WAS 
CONCERNED THEY WERE JUST BEING MADE 
IN BIG FACTORY BUT NOW I HAVE 
ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED IT CHANGED MY 
VIEWS ON CHEAP FASHION BECAUSE 
BEFORE I THOUGHT IT IS O. K. I'M 
GETTING IT FOR LIKE TWO BUT YOU 
DON'T REALISE THAT THE PEOPLE 
MAKING IT ARE ONLY GETTING TWO 
PENCE FOR THAT ITEM 
DID YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT THE WORLD 
OF FASHION OR MORE ABOUT YOURSELF 
I LEARNED MORE ABOUT MYSELF I 
THINK I WAS QUITE AWARE L. WAS 
SOMEONE WHO HAD ACTUALLY GONE OUT 
OF MY WAY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT 
ETHICAL FASHION BEFORE I HAD GONE 
THERE AND I WAS QUITE AWARE OF WHAT 
TO EXPECT AND WHAT KIND OF THINGS 
GO ON L. WASN'T MAYBE AS NAIVE AS 
SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE BUT YEAH 
I THINK I LEARNED LOT ABOUT 
MYSELF AS WELL 
IT IS A FASCINATING WATCH 
ONCE YOU KNOW THAT THE T. SHIRTS ARE 
PRODUCED CHEAPLY IN SWEAT SHOPS IS 
WHETHER YOU CONTINUE TO BUY THEM 
IF YOU DIDN'T THEY WOULD HAVE TO 
FIN ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT 
THE AMOUNT OF HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS 
PROBLEM 
WE WILL SEE YOU STARTING PROBLEM TO LOOK AT THE PROBLEM YOU ARE 
COMING BACK TO HAVE ANOTHER CHAT 
WE ARE INDEED YES 
WHAT'S THE TIME IT IS SIX HUNDRED FORTY TWO THE 
CROWDS WERE OUT IN FORCE IN SQUARE 
LEICESTER LAST NIGHT FOR THE 
OPENING OF A NEW BRITISH COMEDY 
THREE AND OUT AMONG THE CROWD WERE 
LONDON UNDERGROUND WORKERS WHO ARE 
NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE PLOT 
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT IS CAUSING THE 
FUSS FUSS I WANT TO SWIM WITH GREAT WHITE 
SHARK NO CAGE JUST ME AND THE 
BEAST EYEBALL TO EYEBALL 
YEAH WELL THE THING IS WE HAVE 
ONLY GOT THIS WEEKEND IT HAS TO BE 
MONDAY MONDAY GIVE IT TO CHARITYMENT 
SOMEBODY YOU KNOW THAT COULD USE 
SOME CASH WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY 
MY FAMILY THEY PROBABLY THINK I'M 
DEAD ALREADY 
THERE YOU GO IT WOULD BE A NICE 
SURPRISE FOR THEM 
SIMON FROM ASLEF IS HERE YOU HAVE 
SEEN THE FILM WHAT MADE YOU ANGRY 
IT WAS THE TRIVIALISATION FOR OUR 
PEOPLE WHICH IS A SERIOUS 
INDUSTRIAL INJURY WE HAVE NO 
CONTROL OVER AND WHEN IT DOES 
HAPPEN IT IS A LIFE CHANGING EVENT 
AND MANY DRIVERS NEVER DRIVE 
TRAIN AGAIN 
BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE THROWING 
THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF TRAINS 
YES YES HOW MANY PEOPLE FALL UNDER TRAINS A 
YEAR 
IT IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OF THOSE ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE YEAR ARE ACTUALLY SPECIFIED AS SUICIDES 
SOME ARE OPEN VERDICTS 
YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU KNOW LOT 
OF TRAIN DRIVERS ARE AFFECTED WHEN 
IT HAPPENED AS IF YOU HAVE SOME 
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE 
YES I HAVE 
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE L. HAVE COME 
ACROSS THE AFTERMATH OF A TRAIN IN 
FRONT HITTING A BODY AND SOMEONE 
FALLING FROM A TRAIN WHICH IS NOT 
BREAKFAST MATERIAL 
IS YOUR ISSUE SPECIFICALLY WITH THE 
MAKERS OF THE FILM OR WITH 
TRANSPORT FOR LONDON LONDON 
UNDERGROUND ALLOWING THEIR 
FACILITIES TO BE USED IN MAKING THE 
FILM 
WE WERE ASTONISHED THAT FILM LONDON UNDERGROUND ALLOWED IT TO BE 
FILMED THEY ARE AWARE OF THE 
EFFECT THIS HAS ON ITS EMPLOYEES 
AND THE MANAGING DIRECTOR ISSUED A 
STATEMENT TO STAFF SAYING THAT 
PERHAPS WITH HINDSIGHT IT MIGHT NOT 
OF BEEN A GOOD IDEA 
THE FILM MAKERS WILL SAY IT IS 
MEANT TO BE DARK COMEDY YOU HAVE 
SEEN IT AND THERE IS A STORY 
UNDERNEATH IT WHICH IS A STORY OF 
REDEMPTION THERE IS A POSITIVE 
MESSAGE WITHIN THE FILM 
THAT MIGHT 
BE PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 
IT DOES SENSATIONISE THE WHOLE 
ISSUE THERE IS A SCENE WHERE A 
YOUNG TEENAGE BOY IS DRAGGED OFF A 
PLATFORM BY A DOG 
AND HE JUST ON A MOMENT OF IMPACT 
IT CUTS TO THE CANTEEN WHERE THERE 
IS A PLATE OF TOMATO SAUCE IS 
SLOPPED ON THE PLATE 
THE TREATMENT OF THE INCIDENTS AS 
WELL OR APART FROM THE ETHOS OF THE 
FILM THAT YOU ARE BOTHERED ABOUT 
IT SENSATIONISES AND TRIVIALISES 
SOMETHING THAT'S A REAL ISSUE FOR 
US US WHEN YOU DEMONSTRATE AT PREMIERE 
AND WHEN OTHERS CALLED FOR A 
BOYCOTT OF THE FILM AS SOON AS YOU 
DO THAT THE PUBLICITY PROFILES 
SHOOTS UP 
OF COURSE IT DOES WE 
HAVE PROBABLY DONE THEM A FAVOUR 
IT IS A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD AND FOR 
US IT IS RAISING THE ISSUE OF 
TRAUMA SUPPORT TRAUMA SUPPORT FOR 
DRIVERS CAN BE PATCHY AND SOME 
COMPANIES THEY ARE EXCELLENT IN 
OTHER AREAS AND I WON'T NAME AND 
SHAME THEY JUST BASICALLY GIVE YOU 
HERE IS A PHONE NUMBER TO PHONE 
FOR FREE OVER THE COUNTER 
COUNSELLING SESSIONS AND WE HOPE TO 
SEE YOU BACK AT WORK AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE 
THERE IS NO RULE ON POSSIBLE LONDON UNDERGROUND 
NO THERE IS NO RULE AT ALL 
THANK YOU 
AND WE'LL BE TALKING TO ONE OF THE 
ACTORS FROM THE FILM LATER ON THIS 
IS BREAKFAST THE MAIN STORIES THIS 
MORNING MORTGAGE LENDERS WILL BE 
ASKED TO THROW A LIFELINE TO 
STRUGGLING HOMEOWNERS WHEN THE 
CHANCELLOR MEETS THEM LATER TODAY 
AND THE RBS IS HOPING TO RAISE TWELVE 
BILLION THIS MORNING AND DECLAN 
WILL HAVE MORE ON THAT 
AND I 
ARE NORTHERNERS NIECEER TO 
THEIR NEIGHBOURS AND MORE FRIENDLY 
TO THEIR FAMILIES RESEARCH SHOWS 
SO WE'LL LOOK AT THE NEW NORTH 
SOUTH DIVIDE WELL I THINK THEY 
ARE AREN'T THEY 
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND 
SO WHEN I'VE LIVED IN LIVERPOOL 
AND LEEDS THAN LONDON BUT YOU 
MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW 
HELLO MATT I CAN VOUCH FOR THE 
NORTHERNERS NORTHERNERS IT'S A LOVELY DAY OUT THERE AND 
ONCE THE SPRING SUNSHINE GETS TO 
WORK IT WILL WARM UP A BIT THERE 
IS SOME LOW MISTY CLOUD OVER THE 
CENTRE OF ENGLAND AT THE MOMENT AND 
WALES AND EASTERN SCOTLAND AT THE 
MOMENT AND IT WILL FEEL CHILLY 
OVER NORTH SEA COASTS BUT FURTHER 
TO THE WEST IT SHOULD BE DRY AND 
BRIGHT AND BRIGHT OVER NORTHERN 
IRELAND ALTHOUGH CLOUD WILL 
THICKEN FROM THE WEST DURING THE 
AFTERNOON SOME SEA BREEZES ACROSS 
THE ENGLISH CHANNEL COASTS BUT 
COME INLAND AND IT WILL BE VERY 
PLEASANT INDEED WITH TEMP PEAKING 
AT PERHAPS SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN CELSIUS AND 
THE WARMTH WILL CONTINUE FOR THE 
REST OF THE WEEK 
NOW LOOK AT THIS MORNING'S PAPERS 
THE DAILY EXPRESS HAS AN 
INTERESTING STORY ON ITS FRONT PAGE 
BRITISH DOCTORS HAVE CARRIED OUT 
PIONEERING SURGERY TO RESTORE THE 
SIGHT OF TWO BLIND PATIENTS AND 
THEY'VE GIVEN THEM BIONIC EYE IT 
WILL BE A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THEY 
KNOW IF IT IS TRULY SUCCESSFUL BUT 
IF IT IS THAT WILL BE A REVELATION 
THE SUN FOCUSES ON MEETING 
YESTERDAY BETWEEN PRINCE HARRY AND 
BEN WHO WAS IN A COMA WHEN HE CAME 
BACK FROM IRAN THEY MET SOLDIERS 
IN RECOUPERATION THEY'RE TRYING TO 
RAISE MONEY FOR A CENTRE TO LOOK 
AFTER INJURED SOLDIERS 
AND THIS STORY ABOUT ALISTAIR 
DARLING ASKING MORTGAGE LENDERS TO 
DO THEIR UTMOST NOT TO REPOSSES 
HOMES AND THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HAS 
BROWN BROWN FAILING TO PLACATE 
LABOUR REBELS OVER THE ABOLITION OF 
THE TEN P. TAX RATE LAST NIGHT 
ALTHOUGH HE MADE A PERSONAL PLEA OF 
CONTRITION CONTRITION AND FATHER OF FOUR FINDS HIMSELF 
WITH CRIMINAL RECORD BECAUSE HE 
WAS FINED BECAUSE HIS BIN WAS SO 
FULL AND HE WOULDN'T PAY IT AND 
HE WAS GIVEN AN ON THE SPOT FINE 
AND HE REFUSED TO PAY THAT TOO AND 
HE WAS THREATENED AGAIN AND NOW HE 
IS GOING TO BE SENT TO PRISON 
AND IN THE BUSINESS NEWS WE'RE 
EXPECTING RBS TO SAY IT IS 
EXPECTING ITS SHAREHOLDERS TO COUGH 
UP ANYWHERE BETWEEN TEN BILLION AND 
TWELVE BILLION TO GET THEM THROUGH 
TOUGH TIMES AND FOR IT TO ACT LIKE 
A CUSHION 
BUT WE WILL LEARN WITH IT COULD 
SELL SOME OF ITS OTHER BUSINESSES 
LIKE DIRECT LINE BUT THERE IS 
CRITICISM FROM SHAREHOLDERS THAT 
THIS HAS BEEN SPRUNG OVER ON THEM 
OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEK SO 
WE'RE WATCHING FOR THAT AT SEVEN A M. AND 
WE'RE ALSO WATCHING FOR HINT THAT 
THE AIRPORT COMPANY THAT OWNS 
HEATHROW MIGHT BE BROKEN UP THE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION IS EXAMINING 
B. A. A. IT HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE 
STANDARD OF SERVICE WE GET AS 
PASSENGERS AND IT SAYS IT WILL GIVE 
ITS FIRST THINKING ON WHAT TO DO 
TODAY TODAY B. A. A. OWNS THE MAJOR AIRPORTS IN 
LONDON HEATHROW GATWICK AND 
STANSTEAD AND THE MAIN SCOTTISH 
AIRPORTS GLASGOW EDINBURGH AND 
ABERDEEN LAST YEAR MORE THAN FORTY PER CENT 
OF PASSENGERS PASSED THROUGH A B. A. A. 
AIRPORT BUT SOME SAY IT SHOULDN'T 
BE ALLOWED TO OWN ALL THE MAJOR 
AIRPORTS IN LONDON AND ARE CALLING 
FOR A SALE OF ONE OF THEM B. A. A. SAYS 
FARCE FORCING SALE WOULD THREATEN 
THEIR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES SIMON 
CALDER JOINS US WOULD FORCING B. A. A. 
TO SELL AN AIRPORT MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE TO PASSENGERS THE THE AIRLINES ARE CONVINCED THAT SELLING 
GATWICK DEFINITELY WOULD B. A. A. IS 
THE BILLY NO MATES OF THE CORPORATE 
WORLD THE IRLS WHICH PAY IT 
DIRECTLY AIRLINES WHICH PAY IT 
DIRECTLY AND THE PASSENGERS WHICH 
PAY IT INDIRECTLY BELIEVE THEY'RE 
GETTING FAR TOO LITTLE FOR FAR TOO 
MUCH IF YOU PUT GATWICK UP IN 
DIRECT COMPETITION WITH HEATHROW 
SAY THE AIRLINES AND THE 
PASSENGERS WOULD BE GIVEN BETTER 
SERVICES 
BUT WOULD ANOTHER AIRPORT SERVICES OWNED BY A DIFFERENT COMPANY STILL 
BE ABLE TO COMPETE AS AGGRESSIVELY 
IT WOULD STILL BE UP AGAINST B. A. A. 
WHICH OWNS SIX OTHER MAJOR 
AIRPORTS 
YES BUT IF YOU HAD A AIRPORTS LARGE FOREIGN COMPANY COMING IN 
THEY WOULD HAVE NO DOUBTS THEY 
COULD MAKE GATWICK MORE PROFITABLE 
AND DRAG SOME OF THE MORE PREMIUM 
TRAFFIC AWAY FROM HEATHROW IN 
ADDITION TO THAT YOU HAVE THE FACT 
THAT ALL THE SCOTTISH AIRPORTS OR 
THE LEADING ONES ARE OWNED BY B. A. A. 
AND MANY SCOTTISH PEOPLE ARE 
FURIOUS THAT THEIR AIRPORTS ARE RUN 
FROM LONDON AND CONTROLLED OUT IN 
MADRID AND THEY SAY THAT IS WRONG

YOU THE UPDATES ON BOTH THORS

ROUTES ACROSS EAST ANGLIA WILL 
REDUCE AIR TRAFFIC CONGESTION OVER

WILL SUFFER MORE NOISE 
DESPITE THE 
FACT THAT ELSEWHERE THEY'RE TRYING 
TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
COVERED AND CLAIM THEY CAN REDUCE 
IT BY TEN PER CENT SO IF YOU LIKE OVER 
THE WHOLE REGION THERE IS A TEN PER CENT 
REDUCTION BUT HERE AT LUTON THERE

IT INVOLVED TWO THOUSAND OFFICERS AND 
THERE WERE THIRTY SEVEN ARRESTS OFFENCES 
INCLUDED BREACHING THE PEACE 
PUBLIC ORDER OFFENCES AND HANDLING 
STOLEN GOODS NOW THE WEATHER 
A DECENT DAY COMING UP TODAY WE 
START WITH A FEW MIST PATCHES 
ACROSS THE CHILTERNS AND A LITTLE 
BIT OF CLOUD BUT THAT WILL 
DISPERSE QUICKLY DURING THE MORNING 
AND MOST US WILL ENJOY LONG 
SPELLS OF SUNSHINE IT COULD BE 
CHILLY AROUND THE THAMES ESTUARY 
BUT INLAND TEMPERATURES WILL REACH 
SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN DEGREES AND IT WILL FEEL 
WARM IN THE STRONG AEROPLANE SEASON 
SHINE OVERNIGHT CLEAR SPELLS AT 
FIRST BUT DURING THE SECOND HALF 
OF THE NIGHT CLOUD WILL COME IN

TO GET THE BANK THROUGH THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH MAKING IT EASIER TO TIE THE 
KNOT IN CHURCH RELAXING THE RULES 
TO ENCOURAGE MORE COUPLES TO TO 
EXCHANGE VOWS A THE ALTER 
IT IS AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE A 
CULTURE CULTURE THE TEST BED FOR 
NATIONAL POLICIES LIKE ROAD PRICING 
WE WILL BE EXPLORING WHY LONDON'S 
CHOICE OF MAYOR MATTERS TO YOU 
PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO EACH 
OTHER FOR MANY YEARS BURY THE 
HATCHET AND GOOD FRIENDSHIPS HAVE 
BEEN FORMED FROM IT 
A REPORT SAYS THE NORTH IS WHERE 
GOOD NEIGHBOURS BECOME GOOD FRIENDS 
EWAN MCGREGOR TALKS ABOUT HIS NEW 
FILM AND BEING TREATED FOR SKIN 
CANCER 
THE CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING IS 
TO MEET MORTGAGE LENDERS LATER 
TODAY TO URGE THEM TO DO MORE TO 
HELP STRUGGLING BORROWERS HE WANTS 
TO FIND WAYS TO HELP THOSE WHO 
CAN'T MEET THEIR REPAYMENTS OR 
THOSE WHOSE FIXED RATES ARE COMING 
TO AN END 
IT IS HARD TO SMILE WHEN READING A 
MORTGAGE OFFER THESE DAYS AND 
NADIA IS FAR FROM ALONE SHE CAN 
ONLY AFFORDING THE MORTGAGE 
PAYMENTS ON HER NEW HOME IF SHE 
JUST PAYS OFF THE INTEREST IT 
MEANS THE AMOUNT SHE OWES ISN'T 
GOING DOWN AND RECENT FALLS IN THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND BASE RATE HAVEN'T 
HELPED HELPED WELL IT WAS DISAPPOINTING THAT THE 
LENDERS CAN'T GIVE US THE REDUCED 
RATE THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAVE NOW 
MADE RECENTLY MADE BECAUSE IT WOULD 
BENEFIT US ME AS A HOME OWNER 
SWITCHING TO A REPAYMENT MORTGAGE 
RATHER THAN INTEREST ONLY 
OTHER BORROWERS ARE WORSE OFF 
UNABLE TO GET AN AFFORDABLE 
MORTGAGE AT ALL TODAY LENDERS 
WILL COME UNDER PRESSURE TO HELP 
THEM OUT THE CHANCELLOR IS MEETING 
BANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES TO 
DISCUSS HOW THEY CAN PASS ON THE 
BENEFITS OF FALLING INTEREST RATES 
THE DAY AFTER THEY WERE GIVEN A 
HELPING HAND THEMSELVES WITH THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND'S FIFTY BILLION PLAN 
TO HELP LENDERS SWAP MORTGAGE DEBT 
FOR GOVERNMENT BONDS 
BUT IT SEEMS BERATES FOR CONSUMERS 
ARE FAR FROM GUARANTEED 
MOST OF THE LARGE LENDERS PASSED 
THEM ON IN BASE RATE CUTS WE HAVE 
EMPHASISED TO THE CHANCELLOR THAT 
THE COST OF FUNDS AREN'T LINKED TO 
THE BASE RATE AND IT IS NOT 
SIMPLE DECISION 
THE ADVICE FOR ANYONE STRUGGLING 
WITH THEIR MORTGAGE IS TO CONTACT 
THEIR LENDER AS AS QUICKLY AS THEY 
CAN THEY MAYBE ABLE TO FIND A WAY 
TO REDUCE THEIR PAYMENTS WITHOUT 
FALLING INTO ARREARS 
WE ARE GOING TO GO TO THE STOCK 
EXCHANGE BECAUSE DECLAN IS GETTING

EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS IF THEY 
DON'T BUY THE NEW SHARES THE 
RIGHTS WILL PASS ON TO OTHER PEOPLE 
IT IS RAISING TWELVE BILLION BILLION 
FROM SHAREHOLDERS THE BANK IS 
DOING THIS BECAUSE IT WANTS TO 
FATTEN UP ITS FINANCIAL CUSHION 
THE MONEY THAT BANKS KEEP TO ONE 
SIDE TO GET THEM THROUGH THROUGH 
DIFFICULT DIFFICULT TIMES RBS HAD 
ONE OF THE THINNEST FINANCIAL 
CUSHIONS OF THE BIG BANKS BECAUSE 
IT SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON THE TAKE 
OVER OF A DUTCH BANK LAST YEAR 
THAT COST FIFTY BILLION THIS MOVE 
TODAY TURNS IT FROM HAVING ONE OF 
THE THINNEST CUSHIONS TO ONE OF THE 
FATTEST CUSHIONS OF THE MAJOR BANKS 
THE MAIN HEADLINE AND THE DETAILS 
COMING IN IS THAT RBS IS TO ASK 
SHAREHOLDERS TO COUGH UP TWELVE 
BILLION BILLION DECLAN THANK YOU FOR THE BREAKING 
NEWS NEWS BACK LATER FOR REACTION ON IT 
COUPLES WILL FIND IT EASIER TO GET

NEED A CONVINCING VICTORY TO KEEP 
HER CAMPAIGN ALIVE 
THE TONE HAS BECOME MORE EXTREME 
AND CONFRONTATIONAL HILLARY 
CLINTON'S LATEST T. V. COMMERCIAL 
COMMERCIAL USING IMAGES OF PEARL 
HARBOR AND OSAMA BIN LADEN TO 
SUGGEST ONLY SHE CAN WITH STAND THE 
PRESSURES OF OFFICE 
I'M BARACK OBAMA 
WHILE BARACK OBAMA THE CANDIDATE 
OF CHANGE HAS RESORTED TO OLD 
STYLE NEGATIVE ATTACKS 
ISN'T THAT WHAT WE NEED TO CHANGE 
BUILD UP TO PENNSYLVANIA HAS LOOKED 
INCREASINGLY LIKE A NO HOLD BARD 
CONTEST THIS WRESTLING SHOW HAD 
ANIMATED VERSIONS OF THE 
CONTESTANTS BATTLING IT OUT IN THE 
RING IT HASN'T COME TO THAT BUT 
THEIR DIRECT APPEAL TO THE SHOW'S 
FANS ADDS TO SENSE OF DESPERATION 
YOU CAN CALL ME HILLROAD THIS 
ELECTION IS STARTING TO FEEL LIKE 
KING OF THE RING THE ONLY 
DIFFERENCE THE LAST MAN STANDING 
MAY JUST BE A WOMAN 
ALL THE FORCES OF DIVISION AND 
DISTRACTION THAT HAVE STOPPED US 
FROM MAKING PROGRESS FOR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE I HAVE GOT ONE 
QUESTION DO YOU SMELL WHAT BARACK 
OBAMA IS COOKING 
L. N. SIX WEEKS OF CAMPAIGNING BOTH 
CANDIDATES HAVE GONE TO 
EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS TO SHOW THEY 
ARE IN TUNE WITH ORDINARY VOTERS 
BUT IT IS HILLARY CLINTON WHO NEEDS 
THE CONVINCING WIN JUST TO STAY IN 
THE RACE 
DRIVERS UNDER TWENTY IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND COULD BE BANNED FROM 
DRIVING AT NIGHT IT IS PART OF A 
RANGE OF PLANS BEING CONSIDERED TO 
CUT THE NUMBER OF ROADS DEATHS 
CHRIS BUCKLER IS ON THE BANGOR 
BELFAST ROAD IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
FOR US 
GOOD MORNING ROAD SAFETY 
CAMPAIGNERS ARE ADAMANT THAT MORE 
NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENSURE PEOPLE 
ARE SAFE ON THE ROADS THERE ARE OF 
COURSE ALREADY NUMBER OF SCHEMES 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE LEARNING TO 
DRIVE YOU HAVE TO DISPLAY AN L. 
PLATE AND NORTHERN IRELAND IS 
DIFFERENT TO OTHER PARTS OF THE U. K. 
WHENEVER YOU GET RID OF YOUR L. 
PLATE FOR A YEAR YOU HAVE TO SHOW 
AN R. PLATE THAT PUTS RESTRICTIONS 
ON YOU YOU CAN'T DRIVE OVER FORTY FIVE M. P. H. 
TODAY AT THE NORTHERN IRELAND 
ASSEMBLY AT STORMONT THEY ARE 
TALKING ABOUT TAKING IT FURTHER 
FURTHER THEY WANT TO ADD FURTHER 
RESTRICTIONS IN THE EFFORT TO SAVE 
LIVES LIVES CRASHES DON'T DISCRIMINATE VICTIMS 
CAN BE ANY AGE 
BUT THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT THE 
NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE KILLED IN 
TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS EVERY YEAR 
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY WARNINGS AND 
CAMPAIGNS NOW THERE ARE SOME WHO 
BELIEVE IT IS TIME TO PUT 
RESTRICTIONS ON NEWLY QUALIFIED 
DRIVERS DRIVERS AS ONE OF STORMONT'S YOUNGEST 
POLITICIANS WHO IS PUTTING FORWARD 
THE PROPOSALS 
I AM SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE PEOPLE 
WON'T BE HAPPY WITH THIS WHAT I 
WOULD BE HAPPY IS IF I WAS A PARENT 
WHOSE CHILD WAS GOING OUT IN THE 
CAR FOR THE FIRST TIME OR IN FIVE 
YEARS TIME WHEN THEY KNOW THEY ARE 
STILL SAFE AND THEIR FRIENDS ARE 
WITH THEM THEY WILL SEE THE MERITS 
IN THE SCHEME 
THE NEW MEASURES CALL FOR A TOTAL 
ALCOHOL BAN A BAN ON CARRYING 
TEENAGE PASSENGERS 
MANY YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL THE IDEAS 
WON'T WORK 
IF YOU ARE SEVENTEEN YOUR FRIENDS WILL BE 
THE SAME AGE AS YOU YOU ARE GOING 
AROUND ON YOUR OWN WITH OVER TWENTY 
YEAR OLDS I THINK I DON'T THINK 
IT IS PRACTICAL 
JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE YOUNG AND 
INEXPERIENCED DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY 
YOU ARE A BAD DRIVER 
SIMILAR SCHEMES OPERATE IN OTHER 
PARTS OF THE WORLD AND IT IS 
CLAIMED THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL 
IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS 
INVOLVING TEENAGE DRIVERS 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER 
MEASURES TO HELP ROAD SAFETY FOR 
EXAMPLE ON THIS ROAD AVERAGE 
SPEED CAMERAS HAVE BEEN PUT UP YOU 
HEARD FROM THE YOUNG PEOPLE WE WE 
SPOKE TO NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE 
LAST NIGHT THEY SAID THEY WEREN'T 
HAPPY WITH THE MEASURES WHAT WILL 
BE INTERESTING IS TO SEE WHAT THE 
POLITICIANS AT STORMONT THINK 
PARTICULARLY THE MINISTER 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ROAD SAFETY IT IS 
UNDERSTOOD SHE IS CONSIDERING SOME 
OF THE MEASURES SERIOUSLY AND THESE 
COULD GO OUT TO CONSULTATION 
CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW THE ACTOR EWAN MCGREGOR HAS 
SPOKEN ABOUT BEING DIAGNOSED WITH 
SKIN CANCER HE TOLD THE B. B. C. HE HAS 
BEEN GIVEN THE ALL CLEAR BUT HAD 
TWO MOLES REMOVED FROM HIS FACE 
I WENT TO HAVE THEM CHECKED YOU 
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IF YOU'RE PALE 
SKINNED AND SPEND TIME IN THE SUN 
WITH MOLES L. WENT TO SEE A 
SPECIALIST WHO THOUGHT THEY SHOULD 
BE REMOVED AND HE WAS CORRECT 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT M. P. LEMBIT 
OPIK IS TO MARRY HIS CHEEK GIRL 
GIRLFRIEND AFTER PROPOSING TO HER 
IN ROME 
HE PROPOSE TODAY GABRIELA IRIMIA 
BESIDE THE TREVI FOUNTAIN LAST WEEK 
THE COUPLE WHO MET IN TWO THOUSAND SIX ON A T. V. 
PROGRAMME ARE PLANNING TO GET 
MARRIED NEXT YEAR OR MAYBE THE YEAR 
AFTER AFTER OR MAYBE THE YEAR AFTER THAT 
CHEEKY CHEEKY SPEAKING OF MARRIAGE 
WE WILL BE TALK BEING IT NOW DID 
YOUR CHILDHOOD DREAMS OF YOUR 
WEDDING DAY INVOLVE YOU WALKING 
DOWN THE AISLE IN PICTURE 
POSTCARD VILLAGE OR SIGNING THE 
FORM IN A REGISTER OFFICE A CHEANG 
IN THE LAW IS BEING CONSIDERED TO 
MAKE MARRYING IN AN AN ANGLICAN 
CHURCH EASIER 
WE ARE JOINED BY RIGHT REVEREND 
NICHOLAS BAINES THE BISHOP OF 
CROYDON AND WEDDING PLANNER ZOE 
LINGARD LINGARD BISHOP NICK IS THIS GOOD IDEA 
THE CHURCH OF S. GENERAL 
SYNOD AGREED TO BROADEN THE 
CRITERIA BY WHICH PEOPLE CAN GET 
MARRIED WE HAVE TO HOLD TOGETHER 
THE PASS TORL LINK WITH THE CHURCH 
IT IS NOT THE THE CONSUMER 
COMMODITY THAT YOU CAN SAY IT IS 
PRETTY CHURCH I WILL GET MARRIED 
THERE THERE THERE HAS TO BE A CONNECTION 
WITH YOUR PARENTS LIVING THERE 
THERE IS SEVERAL CRITERIA IF YOU 
HAVE BELONGED IN SOME WAY TO A 
CHURCH CHURCH BUT WANT TO HOLD THE PASS TORAL 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND 
THE COUPLE IT IS NOT A COMMODITY 
THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY 
YOU GOT MARRIED LAST YEAR AND YOU 
HAD TO COME TO AN ARRANGEMENT WITH 
THE VICAR WHERE YOU GAVE A FALSE 
ADDRESS 
NO IT WAS DIFFERENT ADDRESS BECAUSE IT WAS THE SISTER CHAPEL OF 
A PARISH IT IS DIFFERENT 
BUT IT WASN'T A CHURCH THAT I 
ATTENDED OR WAS ON THE ELECTORAL 
ROLL FOR IT WAS A FLEXIBLE VICAR 
WHO UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF 
GETTING MARRIED THAT IS SPECIAL 
WHY IS IT SHALLOW TO GET MARRIED 
SOMEWHERE THAT'S BEAUTIFUL 
WHY IS IT SHALLOW 
WHO WHO SAID IT 
WAS SHALLOW ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO 
BE MARRIED SOMEWHERE BEAUTIFUL 
RATHER THAN SOMEWHERE UGLY BUT THE 
QUESTION IS ONE OF LAW AND CLERGY 
HAVE TO APPLY THE LAW SOME PEOPLE 
FAIL TO UNDERSTAND IF THE VICAR IS 
SAYING YOU CAN'T BE MARRIED HERE 
HE IS NOT DOING IT BECAUSE OF A 
WHIM OR HE DOESN'T LIKE THE COUPLE 
BUT IT IS THE LAW OF THE LAND AND 
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE LEGAL 
PRELIMINARIES ARE DONE CORRECTLY 
AND THAT PUTS YOU IN A DIFFICULT 
POSITION POSITION YEAH BUT I THINK IT HAS BEEN 
DIFFICULT FOR COUPLES WHO FOUND 
THAT ONE VICAR MIGHT BE SAYING ONE 
THING AND ANOTHER IS SAYING 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND IS BEING 
MORE FLEXIBLE THAN OTHERS AND 
THAT'S BEEN DIFFICULT FOR COUPLES 
WANTING TO GET MARRIED 
IT HAS FOR SOME AND SOME CLERGY ARE 
NOT GOOD AT EXPLAINING TO TO 
COUPLES WHY THEY CAN'T OR MARRIED 
IN A PARTICULAR PLACE 
WHERE DID YOUR SON AND DAUGHTER GET 
MARRIED 
WE HAVE MOVED AROUND WITH MARRIED MY WORK AND THE CHILDREN HAVE MOVED 
AS WELL MY DAUGHTER GOT MARRIED TWENTY 
MONTHS AGO IN LONDON BUT WE HAD TO 
GET AN ARCHBISHOP'S SPECIAL LICENCE 
I DID THE WEDDING AND MY OLDEST SON 
GOT MARRIED AT THE END OF DECEMBER 
LAST YEAR UP IN YORKSHIRE WHERE 
HIS THAT'S MY DAUGHTER MELANIE 
AND LIAM THEY ARE IN CROYDON BUT 
LIVE IN NOTTINGHAM AND RICHARD AND 
EMMA WHO HAVE JUST APPEARED THEY 
WERE MARRIED WHERE EMMA CAME UP UP 
UP IN YORKSHIRE BUT THEY LIVE IN 
LIVERPOOL LIVERPOOL JUST GO BACK TO THE PICTURE POST 
KOORD ISSUE POSTCARD ISSUE 
DOESN'T FAITH COME INTO THIS THIS THIS IS THE POINT SOME PEOPLE AND I 
HAVE BEEN A VICAR FOR A LONG TIME 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY WE 
JUST WANT TO BE MARRIED HERE 
BECAUSE IT LOOKS NICE IN THE 
PHOTOS WHEN YOU SAY THERE IS 
CONTENT TO THIS THERE IS CHRISTIAN 
MARRIAGE MARRIAGE THE SAME QUESTION TO YOU 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE WHAT A 
CHRISTIAN IS DOES THAT MEAN THAT 
YOU ATTEND CHURCH EVERY WEEK I'M 
NOT SURE AND I DON'T THINK THERE 
ARE SO MANY COUPLES WHO DO WANT TO 
GET MARRIED IN CHURCH JUST 
BECAUSE IT IS PRETTY THINK THEY 
TEND TO GO FOR THE CIVIL CEREMONY 
BUT I THINK IT IS A GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CHURCH TO HELP 
COUPLES WHO ARE ON THE BORDERS WHO 
WOULD THINK I WOULD LIKE A 
WHAT THE THE CHURCH IS BEING IS 
SAYING ISN'T IT FANTASTIC THAT 
PEOPLE WANT TO GET MARRIED AND GET 
MARRIED IN CHURCH AND WE ARE 
SAYING WE RECOGNISE THE WORLD HAS 
CHANGED PEOPLE ARE MORE MOBILE AND 
ROOTS AND BELONGING REALLY MATTER 
AND WE WANT TO TO TAKE THAT 
SERIOUSLY 
THANK YOU SERIOUSLY A VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSION 
I LOVE SAYING BISHOP NICK 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING I'LL 
READ OUT THIS E. MAIL FROM SUE IN 
NUMP BERLAND MY FATHER KNEW 
EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING FORTY YEARS 
AND TRIED TO MAKE SURE THAT A 
COUPLE COMING TO CHURCH UNDERSTOOD 
THEIR VOWS AND WHY THEY WERE SAYING 
THEM BUT THIS NOW THROWS TRUE 
CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE INTO DISARRAY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT 
NOW THE PAPERS 
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH SAYS GORDON 
BROWN FAILED TO PLACATE LABOUR 
BACKBENCH REBELS OVER THE TEN P. TAX 
RATE LAST NIGHT AND THERE IS A 
PICTURE IN THE SUN OF PRINCE HARRY 
AND A MAN HE EFFECTIVELY WORKED 
WITH IN THE ROYAL MARINES AND LOST 
AN ARM AND A LEG AND PRINCE HARRY 
WAS IN THE SAME PLANE WITH HIM 
COMING BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN AND 
THE PRINCES HAVE DECIDED TO SUPPORT 
A CENTRE IN SURREY WHICH NEEDS A 
LOT OF SUPPORT TO LOOK AFTER 
INJURED SOLDIERS 
AND THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT A TINY 
CAMERA IMPLANTED ON THE BACK OF A 
BLIND PATIENT'S EYE TO RESTORE 
SIGHT WE'LL FIND OUT IN EIGHT 
WEEKS' TIME IF IT HAS BEEN 
SUCCESSFUL OR NOT 
AND ALISTAIR DARLING IS CALLING ON 
MORTGAGE LENDERS TO GO EASY ON 
FAMILIES STRUGGLING THEIR MORTGAGES 
AND TO DO THEIR UTMOST NOT TO STAR 
REPOSSESSIONS REPOSSESSIONS AND THE TIMES HAS THE STORY WITH A 
PICTURE OF A TREE AND THIS IS IN 
MAYFAIR AND VALUED AT A QUARTER OF 
A MILLION POUNDS L. AND THE DAILY 
MAIL HAS THE STORY OF A FAMILY WITH 
THEIR WHEELIE BIN THAT WAS SO BIG 
AND OVERFULL AND THE TOP WAS POKING 
UP HE WAS GIVEN AN ON THE SPOT 
FINE AND HE FAILED TO PAY IT AND 
HE WAS GIVEN ANOTHER FINE AND HE 
REFUSED THAT ONE AND NOW HE IS 
THREATENED WITH JAIL 
STILL TO COME 
PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SPOKEN FOR YEARS 
BURYED THE HATCHET AND GOOD 
FRIENDSHIPS HAVE BEEN FORMED FROM 
IT 
ARE NORTHERNERS MORE SOCIABLE IT WE'LL FIND OUT IN TWENTY MINUTES COULD 
CURFEWS CUT ROAD DEATHS WHY 
TEENAGE DRIVERS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
COULD SOON BE BANNED FROM DRIVING 
AT NIGHT OR CARRYING OTHER TEENAGE 
PASSENGERS AND NOW THE WEATHER 
GOOD MORNING WE'VE HAD A SPELL OF 
SUSTAINED WEATHER WHERE 
TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY 
BELOW AVERAGE AND NOW WE START TO 
FLIP THE TABLES ON THAT 
TEMPERATURES WILL CLIMB ABOVE 
AVERAGE IN SOME SPOTS THANKS TO A 
DECENT SPELL OF DRY WEATHER AND 
SUNSHINE ACROSS MUCH OF THE COUNTRY 
IT WON'T BE CRYSTAL BLUE SKIES OVER 
ALL AREAS AT THE MOMENT THERE IS A 
FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUD AROUND BUT IT 
IS HIGH BASED AND FAIRLY THIN BUT 
A BIT GREY OVER SOME PARTS OF 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND 
EASTERN SCOTLAND AND THE LOW CLOUD 
OVERNIGHT IS PUSHING OFF OVER THE 
NORTH SEA NOW THE BRIGHT EST 
CONDITIONS REMAIN IN THE WEST AND 
THE BREEZE IS PICKING UP A BIT 
COMING FROM AN EASTERLY DIRECTION 
SO IT WILL FEEL CHILLY ON THE NORTH 
SEA COASTS A BRIGHT DAY THROUGH 
THE NORTH WEST AND NORTHERN EASTERN 
PARTS WHERE THE LOW CLOUD WILL 
DRIFT OFF AWAY BY THE AFTERNOON 
AND THEN INLAND TEMPERATURES WILL 
LIFT TO A PLEASANT SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN DEGREES 
SEA BREEZES WILL DEVELOP ALONG THE 
CHANNEL COASTS AND WESTERN FRINGES 
OF WALES WILL SEE MORE CLOUD 
BUILDING BY THE AFTERNOON AS WILL 
WESTERN PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
AS THE NEXT FRONTAL SYSTEM STARTS 
TO EDGE IN BUT FOR MOST OF US IT 
IS A DRY BRIGHT AND FAIRLY 
PLEASANT SPRING DAY DURING THE 
NIGHT AS WINDS SHIFT AROUND TO A 
SOUTH AND WESTERLY DIRECTION CLOUD 
AND THEN RAIN WILL PUSH IN TO THE 
WEST OF THE COUNTRY AND 
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP TO FIVE OR 
EIGHT DEGREES SO TOMORROW A WETTER 
START FOR SOME OF US WESTERN 
SCOTLAND THE MIDLANDS AND THE 
SOUTH EAST INITIALLY BUT THEN 
THINGS WILL BRIGHTEN UP WITH 
SUNSHINE AROUND AND TEMPERATURES 
WILL CLIMB AGAIN PERHAPS AS HIGH AS 
EIGHTEEN CELSIUS WHICH IS SIXTY FOUR FAHRENHEIT 
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING 
POLITICAL CONTESTS IN YEARS THE 
PRIZE LONDON'S TOP JOB WITH THE 
POWER TO CHANGE THE LIVES OF WELL 
OVER SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE BUT IF 
YOU LIVE OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL WHY 
SHOULD YOU CARE BREAKFAST'S JULIA 
GEORGE IS FINDING OUT WHY 
GOOD MORNING IF ALL ELECTIONS WERE 
LIKE THIS NO ONE WOULD BE 
JUSTIFIED IN MOONING THAT POLITICS 
IS BORING THE TWO MAIN CONTENDERS 
ARE SO FAMOUS THAT THEY ARE 
REFERRED TO SIMPLY ON FIRST NAME 
TERMS BORIS AND KEN ARE OUTSPOKEN 
AND AT TIMES THEY ARE OUTRAGEOUS 
AND THEY'RE CAMPAIGNING ON ISSUES 
THAT REALLY MATTER TO THE 
ELECTORATE CRIME ROAD PRICING 
HOUSING AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND 
ADDED TO ALL OF THAT THEY ARE 
ABSOLUTELY NECK AND NECK POLITICS 
IS NOT BORING NOT IN LONDON ANY 
WAY WAY THE THEME TO DALLAS 
IT HAS THE MAKINGS OF A GREAT SHOW 
THE BACKDROB DROPS ARE STUNNING 
THE CHARACTERS LARGER THAT LIFE 
IN LONDON'S LATEST POWER STRUGGLE 
THESE ARE THE THREE MAIN PLAYERS 
IT IS A RACE TO RUN A WORLD CLASS 
CITY BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS SUCH A 
PRESTIGIOUS JOB 
THE MAYOR HAS ACQUIRED NEW POWERS 
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SO IT IS 
NOW A MAJOR JOB IN CITY POLITICS 
INDEED IT IS COMPARABLE WITH SOME 
OF THE BIG MAYORSHIPS AROUND THE 
WORLD NEW YORK AND PARIS SO ON 
MAY FIRST LONDONERS HAVE BIG JOB INDEED 
BUT WHAT IF YOU DON'T LIVE INDEED OR WORK IN LONDON DO THE FORTUNES 
OF THIS CITY STILL MATTER WELL 
THERE ARE ISSUES AT STAKE WHICH 
AFFECT THE WHOLE COUNTRY NOT LEAST 
THE ECONOMY LONDON IS A FINANCIAL 
POWER HOUSE IT GENERATES ONE FIFTH 
OF OUR ANNUAL WEALTH AND THE MAYOR 
HAS A YEARLYLY BUDGET OF NINE 
BILLION IF LONDON TALKS IT WILL 
BE HEARD WHAT HAPPENS IN LONDON IS 
CLOSELY WATCHED ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
LOOK OUT FOR ROAD PRICING IN A 
TOWN NEAR YOU A WORLD CITY MUST 
ALSO THRIVE IN THE GLARE OF 
INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY IN FOUR 
YEARS' TIME THE SPRAWLING SITE 
BELOW ME WILL BE THE IMAGE OF 
BRITAIN THAT BOUNCES AROUND THE 
PLANET FOUR BILLION PEOPLE WILL WATCH 
THE LONDON OLYMPICS ON T. V. THAT'S A 
THIRD OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION 
NO PRESSURE THEN DESPITE THE HUGE 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE NEXT 
LONDON MAYOR WHAT EVERYONE IS 
REALLY TALKING ABOUT ARE THE 
CHARACTERS 
BORIS AND KEN ARE LIKE CHARACTERS A COMEDY DUO WHO HATE EACH OTHER IN 
REAL LIFE BUT HAVE TO PRETEND ON 
STAGE BUT IN LIFE IT IS THE OTHER 
WAY AROUND THEY JOSH WITH EACH 
OTHER IN REAL LIFE AND COME ON 
STAGE AND THEY'RE SPITTING POLITICS 
AT EACH OTHER 
AND WHAT ABOUT BRIAN 
PADDICK 
YES THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PADDICK HE COULD DECIDE THE ELECTION VERY 
STIFF AND RATHER STRAIGHT 
AFTER A 
COLOURFUL RACE A GLITTERING PRIZE 
AND THE RESULT IS STILL FAR FROM 
CERTAIN CERTAIN THE TWO MOST RECENT POLLS FOR THE 
EVENING STANDARD AND THE SUNDAY 
TIMES HAVE KEN LIVINGSTONE AND 
BORIS JOHNSTON JUST HANDFUL OF 
PERCENTAGE POINTS APART AND IT 
BECOMES EVEN MORE COMPLICATED WHEN 
YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AND YOU NEED 
TO THE IDEA OF SECOND PREFERENCES 
EVERYONE WHO VOTES FOR THE LONDON 
MAYOR GETS TWO CHOICES AND UNLESS 
SOMEBODY WINS FIFTY PER CENT OUTRIGHT THE 
SECOND CHOICE IS TAKEN INTO 
CONSIDERATION AND THIS IS PROBABLY 
WHERE BRIAN PADDICK WILL BE TAKEN 
INTO ACCOUNT AT THE MOMENT WHEN 
YOU TAKE HIS VOTES INTO ACCOUNT IT 
IS LOOKING NECK AND NECK FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. 
BETWEEN KEN LIVINGSTONE AND BORIS 
JOHNSON SO WHAT ARE THE ISSUES 
LONDONERS WILL VOTE ON 
CONGESTION CHARGING IS KEY PLAYER 
IT WILL BE SEEN AS KEN 
LIVINGSTONE'S LEGACY HOWEVER LONG 
HE ONE IN POWER HE'S GOING TO 
INCREASE THE CHARGE TO FIVE FOR THE 
MOST POLLUTING VEHICLES BORIS 
JOHNSON OPPOSES THE TWENTY FIVE INCREASE 
AND BRIAN PADDICK SAYS HE'D SCRAP 
THE EXTAGS OF THE ZONE AND THE TWENTY FIVE 
CHARGE BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY 
ISSUE THERE ARE ISSUES ABOUT CRIME 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEVEL OF 
VIOLENT CRIME IN THE CAPITAL AND 
NOT LEAST THE NUMBER OF TEENAGE 
MURDERERS IN THE LAST YEAR SO BIG 
ISSUES FOR LONDONERS TO DECIDE UPON 
AND WHAT HAPPENS HERE MATTERS TO 
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY JUST AS 
MUCH 
YOU CAN SEE A FULL LIST OF MUCH CANDIDATES FOR THE LONDON MAYORAL 
ELECTIONS BY CLICKING ON THE 
LONDON WEBSITE 
STILL TO COME 
I JUST WENT TO HAVE THEM CHECKED 
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IF YOU'RE 
PALE SKINNED AND YOU SPEND TIME IN 
THE SON WITH MOLES SO I WENT TO 
SEE SPECIALIST AND HE THOUGHT 
THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED AND HE WAS 
CORRECT 
WE'LL BE TALKING TO EUAN CORRECT MCGREGOR LATER BUT NOW TIME TO GET 
THE NEWS WHERE YOU ARE 
GOOD MORNING FROM B. B. C. LONDON NEWS 
THE COMPANY WHICH RUNS AIRPORTS 
INCLUDING HEATHROW GATWICK AND 
STANSTEAD HAS COME UNDER FIRE FROM 
THE COMPETITION COMMISSION THE 
WATCHDOG SAYS B. A. A.'S OWNERSHIP MAY 
NOT BE SERVING WELL THE INTERESTS 
OF EITHER AIRLINES OR PASSENGERS 
AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE GATHERED AT 
PUBLIC MEETINGS LAST NIGHT TO 
PROTEST OVER PLANS TO CHANGE FLIGHT 
PATHS OVER THE NORTH OF LONDON THE 
BODY SAYS IT WILL CHANGE PATHS OVER 
LONDON BUT ADMITS OTHERS COULD BE 
AFFECTED 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT AFFECTED ELSEWHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO REDUCE 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COVERED AND 
CLAIM THEY CAN REDUCE IT BY TEN PER CENT 
BUT HERE AT LUTON THREE TIMES THE 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL BE AFFECTED 
AND IT IS HUGE 
THE FIFTEENTH AN VERYRIES OF THE DEATH 
OF TEENAGER STEPHEN LAWRENCE WILL 
BE MARKED BY A SPECIAL SERVICE IN 
LONDON TODAY STEPHEN WAS STABBED 
TO DEATH WHILE WAITING FOR A BUS 
AND NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN CONVICTED 
OF HIS MURDER NOW THE TRAVEL NEWS IT'S GOOD NEWS ALL THE WAY ON 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT TODAY NO PROBLEMS 
REPORTED FOR THE UNDERGROUND AND 
MAIN LINE TRAINS ARE LOOKING GOOD 
BUT ON THE ROADS IT IS DIFFERENT 
THIS IS THE PICTURE IN MALDERN THE 
ONE WAY SYSTEM SOUTH BOUND THE 
RIGHT HAND LANE ONE CLOSED DUE TO AN 
ACCIDENT YOU SEE THE POLICE CAR 
THERE AND CORDONS ARE OUT AND 
TRAFFIC IS VERY SLOW ON THE 
APPROACHES 
A GROUP OF M. P.'S HAS LAUNCHED A 
SCATHING ATTACK ON THE COST OF 
STAGING THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS THE 
COMMONS ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS THE 
ORIGINAL ESTIMATES WERE ENTIRELY 
UNREALISTIC AND WORRIES THAT THE 
NEW BUDGET OF NINE POINT THREE BILLION COULD BE 
EXCEEDED AND THE LONDON LEG OF THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY COST FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND 
THE OPERATION INVOLVED TWO THOUSAND 
OFFICERS AND THERE WERE SEVENTY THREE ARRESTS 
NOW THE WEATHER THIRTY SEVEN ARRESTS 
GOOD MORNING THERE IS STILL SOME 
LOW CLOUD ACROSS THE CHILTERNS AND 
OTHER AREAS IN THE REGION BUT IT 
WILL CLEAR AND WE SHOULD BE DUE 
SOME LOVELY SUNSHINE IT COULD BE 
CHILLY IN THE THAMES ESTUARY AS 
THERE IS QUITE A STIFF BREEZE BUT 
COME INLAND AND IT WILL FEEL WARM 
IN THE AEROPLANE SEASON SHINE 
OVERNIGHT CLEAR SPELLS AT FIRST 
BUT THEN CLOUDS WILL SPREAD IN FROM 
THE WEST BRINGING OUTBREAKS OF RAIN 
IN WESTERN AREAS AND THAT WILL 
SPREAD ACROSS ALL AREAS FOR 
WEDNESDAY MORNING BUT IT SHOULD 
CLEAR AWAY AND IT WILL LOOK BETTER 
WITH THE RETURN OF THE SEASON SHINE 
WE'LL BE BACK JUST BEFORE EIGHT A M. 
GOOD MORNING WELCOME IF YOU HAVE 
JUST JOINED US YOU ARE WATCHING 
BREAKFAST WITH BILL BILL TURNBULL 
BILL AND SIAN WILLIAMS 
HOME OWNERS COULD BE OFFERED 
MORTGAGE HOLIDAYS AND OTHER DEALS 
TO KEEP THEM UNDER THEIR OWN ROOF 
THESE ARE TWO OF THE PROPOSALS 
WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED LATER 
TODAY ALISTAIR DARLING IS EXPECTED 
TO INSIST THE MAJOR BANKS AND 
BUILDING SOCIETIES PASS ON THE 
RECENT INTEREST RATE CUTS TO 
CUSTOMERS CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS LOOKING AT MORTGAGE 
PROBLEMS THE CHANCELLOR WILL TRY 
TO AVERT BACKBENCH RESOLT OVER 
THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
M. P.'S ARE ANGRY THAT MILLIONS OF LOW 
EARNERS WILL BE LEFT WORSE OFF 
IN THE LAST MINUTES THE ROYAL 
BANK OF SCOTLAND ANNOUNCED PLANS TO 
RAISE TWELVE BILLION FROM ITS 
SHAREHOLDERS THE RIGHTS ISSUE WILL 
ASK EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS FOR MORE 
CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR NEW SHARES 
THE GROUP SAID IT WAS CARRYING OUT 
A REVIEW OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS 
WHICH COULD LEAD TO THE SALE OF 
CHURCHILL INSURANCE AND DIRECT LINE 
THE COMPETITION COMMISSION SAID 
THAT B. A. A.'S DOMINANCE AS AN AIRPORT 
OPERATOR MAY NOT BE SERVING 
CUSTOMERS AND AIRLINES WELL A 
REPORT STOPPED SHORT OF 
RECOMMENDING THAT B. A. A. SELLS ONE OF 
ITS SEVEN AIRPORTS 
A RISE OF FIVE BILLION IN THE BILL 
FOR THE LONDON OLYMPIC GAMES IS 
FACING CRITICISM THIS MORNING M. P.'S 
ON THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE 
CALLED THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES 
UNREALISTIC THE GOVERNMENT 
ORIGINALLY SAID THE GAMES WOULD 
COST OVER FOUR BILLION THAT'S RISEN 
TO NINE POINT THREE BILLION 
T. H. Y. 
ARE LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN THE 
ORIGINAL BUDGET WHICH APPEARS TO BE 
A STAB IN THE DARK MISSING OUT 
CONTINGENCY VAT SECURITY THAT 
SHOULD OF BEEN INCLUDED BUT I AM 
MORE CONFIDENT THAT THE REVISED 
BUDGET IS MORE ROBUST 
COUPLES WILL FEND IT EASIER TO GET 
FIND IT EASIER TO GET MARRIED IN 
THE CHURCH OF THA OF THEIR CHOICE 
THERE HAS BEEN DECLINE IN THE 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE CHOOSING TO HAVE A 
CHURCH WEDDING 
LOTS OF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT IDEA 
AND THINK IT IS SHALLOW WE WILL 
READ OUT SOME E. MAILS LATER ON 
COMING UP THE BIRDS THAT HAVE 
BECOME PREY WHY THE R. S. P. B. ARE 
CALLING FOR MORE PROTECTION FOR 
BRITAIN'S BUZZARDS WE HAVE A 
GOLDEN EAGLE AND HE IS COMING INTO 
THE STUDIO AFTER EIGHT HUNDRED A M. 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT 
HE IS BIG 
READY 
WE HAVE THE PINK CRICKET READY BALL THAT WE USED FOR THE FIRST 
TIME AT LORDS YESTERDAY 
NOT OUT 
LEG BEFORE 
GOOD KNOWLEDGE 
TWO MATCHES TWO MANAGERS AND TWO 
JOBS ON THE LINE LIVERPOOL VERSUS 
CHELSEA IT IS THE FOURTH YEAR THE 
TWO SIDES MET IN THE COMPETITION 
RAFAEL BENITEZ WILL BE PLEASED TO 
SEE THAT THAT STEPHEN GERRARD IS 
BACK IN THE LINE UP FOR MATCH 
WHICH COULD DEFINE THE CLUB'S 
SEASON SEASON I THINK THAT THE PLAYERS THEY ARE 
FOCUSED ON FOOTBALL BECAUSE THEY 
KNOW THAT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT 
NOW SO YOU TALK 
IT 
IS BETTER IF 
YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING 
YOU CAN BE MORE 
FOCUSED AND 
MAYBE 
IT CAN BE 
CAN HELP 
IN THIS GAME 
AVRAM GRANT IS ANOTHER MAN LOOKING 
OVER HIS SHOULDER HE IS DESPERATE 
FOR CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SUCCESS HE IS 
BOOSTED BY THE RETURN OF FRANK 
LAMPARD BUT MIGHT MISS OUT ON 
DIDIER DROGBA BUT HE CAN ALWAYS 
RELY ON HIS CAPTAIN 
THE RESULTS FOR THEMSELVES UNTIL 
NOW WE ARE HERE IN THE SEMI FINAL 
BECAUSE WE REACHED THE SEMI FINAL

CHALLENGE MANCHESTER UNITED 
WE CAN GO ON TO POSSIBLY WIN THIS 
THIS TROPHY AND WE HAVE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT FORGET WHAT 
HAPPENED IN THE PAST IT IS ABOUT 
NOW AND WE NEED TO TAKE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY THE CURSE OF THE INJURY HAS STRUCK 
JONNY WILKINSON HE WILL HAVE 
SURGERY ON SHOULDER JERN AT THE 
END END END INJURY AT THE END OF 
THE SEASON JONNY WILKINSON 
RECENTLY LOST HIS PLACE AS ENGLAND 
FLY HALF FLY HALF ANOTHER SPORTSMAN SET TO SPEND THE 
SUMMER ON THE TREATMENT TABLE IS

CRUCIBLE THEATRE YESTERDAY THIRTEEN 
WORLD SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIP TITLES 
BETWEEN THEM STEVE DAVIS AND 
STEPHEN WHEN WHEN STEPHEN HENDRY 
WERE IN ACTION 
STEVE DAVIS WASN'T SO LUCKY HE 
NEEDED THIS BLACK TO TAKE A NINE TO EIGHT 
LEAD OVER OVER STUART BINGHAM BUT 
JUST MISSED IT HE TOOK THE NEXT 
FRAME TO WIN THE MATCH DAVIS GOING 
OUT BY TEN TO EIGHT 
WHILE THERE IS SIX POINTS FOR A 
PINK IN SNOOKER HOW ABOUT GETTING 
SIX POINTS FOR PINK IN CRICKET 
THE PINK BALL IS SUPPOSED TO BE 
MORE RESILIENT THAN THE WHITE BALL 
AND COULD BECOME STANDARD IN THE 
TWENTY TWENTY MATCH YOU MIGHT GET VERY 
PORKY FIELDERS CHASING IT IN ONE 
DAY INTERNATIONALS 
IF IT WAS PERCEIVED TO BE BETTER 
THAN WHAT WE HAVE GOT THERE IS NOT 
A PROBLEM WITH THAT IF YOU WANT TO 
USE IT FOR A DIFFERENT COMPETITION 
AND IT IS AS GOOD AS WHAT WE HAVE 
GOT FINE IT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING 
NEW FOR SPONSORS AND THAT TO HAVE A 
DIFFERENT THING AND IF THIS WORKS 
AS WELL AS THE RED BALL AND PEOPLE 
WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT THEN FINE 
LET'S HAVE LOOK AT IT 
WELL DONE YOU 
NEVER PLAY WITH BALL IN THE HOUSE HOUSE LIFT IT UP TO CAMERA THREE IT 
SURVIVED WELL YESTERDAY 
IT GETS BIFFED AROUND 
BUT IT IS THE SAME MATERIAL AS A 
WHITE BALL 
IT IS AN ORDINARY CRICKET BALL TAS 
BIRCH COLOUR 
THE WHITE BALLS PICK UP THE DIRT 
EASILY AND IN A ONE DAY 
INTERNATIONAL THEY HAVE TO CHANGE 
IT ON REGULAR BASIS BECAUSE AFTER 
A WHILE IT GOES TO BLACK AND THAT'S 
NOT USEFUL ON BLACK SCREEN 
THE SURFACE HAS COME AWAY 
YOU GET PINK MARKS ON THE WICKET

NEIGHBOURS THEY BECOME GOOD 
FRIENDS THAT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY IN 
THE NORTH THAN IN THE SOUTH 
ACCORDING TO NEW RESEARCH THAT 
SHOWS STARK DIVIDE IN OUR SOCIAL ATTITUDES ATTITUDES NORTHERNERS SURPRISE SURPRISE ARE 
MORE LIKELY TO CHAT TO THEIR 
NEIGHBOURS AND MAKE REGULAR VISITS 
TO SEE THEIR RELATIVES THAN THEIR 
SOUTHERN COUNTERPARTS 
FIONA TROTT REPORTS 
A CUP OF TEA AND A NEIGHBOURLY CHAT 
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT 
MAKES A FRIENDLY COMMUNITY LOOK NO 
FURTHER THAN HERE 
WELCOME TO LEEDS 
NEIGHBOURS HERE WATER EACH OTHERS 
PLANTS AND LOOK AFTER EACH OTHERS

SURPRISE THAT NORTHERNERS ARE SAID 
TO BE MORE SOCIABLE THAN 
SOUTHERNERS SOUTHERNERS WE HAVE HAD FOUR PARTIES AND IT 
BRINGS NEIGHBOURS FROM TWO STREETS 
THAT WAY AND TWO STREETS THAT WAY 
WHERE WE HAVE SINGING MUSIC FOOD 
DRINK LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO HADN'T 
COME TOGETHER GOT TO KNOW EACH 
OTHER BETTER WE HAVE HAD PEOPLE 
WHO HADN'T SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER FOR 
YEARS BURY THE HATCHET AND GOOD 
FRIENDSHIPS HAVE BEEN FORMED FROM 
IT IT WHO DO THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF 
ENGLAND COMPARE TODAY'S REPORT 
SAYS EIGHTY PER CENT OF NORTHERNERS SPEAK TO 
THEIR NEIGHBOURS REGULARLY COMPARED 
WITH SIXTY THREE PER CENT IN LONDON 
WHEN IT COMES TO FAMILIES THE 
FURTHER NORTH OF ENGLAND THE 
BETTER SIXTY TWO PER CENT IN THE NORTH EAST VISIT 
THEM WEEKLY COMPARED WITH THIRTY FIVE PER CENT IN 
LONDON LONDON THESE ALLIES ARE MORE CORONATION 
STREET THAN REGENT STREET BUT THE 
SOUTH COULD TAKE A LEAF OUT OF 
THEIR BOOK 
THE FRIENDLIEST STREET IN BRITAIN 
IS LEEDS DON'T ALL PILE UP THERE 
WAYNE HEMMINGWAY IS HERE TO DEFEND 
HIS NORTHERN ROOTS ALONG WITH 
MAXWELL HUTCHINSON GED READY FOR 
YOUR GET READY FOR YOUR E. MAILS 
NOW NOW I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING YET 
YOU SAULS SEEM TO UPSET YOU 
ALWAYS SEEM TO UPSET MOST PEOPLE 
YOU SEE THE PEOPLE IN THIS FRIENDLY 
STREET IT LOOKS GHASTLY L. L. BET 
THEY ARE NOT FRIENDLY TO THE PEOPLE 
LIVING A FEW STREETS DOWN THE ROAD 
THEY WILL GUARD THEIR BIT OF LEEDS 
IF YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF 
LEEDS THEY WON'T WANT TO KNOW YOU 
THIS DROPPED IN THE POST AT MY 
OFFICE TODAY THE DECLINE OF 
COMMUNITY CAME NUMBER ONE AMONGST 
PEOPLE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE IN THAT STREET SAY YOU 
ARE FRIENDLY WITH THE PEOPLE IN 
YOUR STREET IN IN LEEDS LIVERPOOL 
BARNSLEY WHATEVER WOULD YOU BE 
FRIENDLY TO THE PEOPLE FOUR STREETS 
AWAY 
I THINK I'M FROM BLACKBURN AWAY AND YOU KNOW IT IS I DIDN'T 
EXPERIENCE ANY TRIBALISM YOU STUCK 
TOGETHER IT WAS A FOOTBALL THING 
AS WELL 
BUT IT WAS IMPORTANT THIS KIND OF 
CALL IT WHATEVER YOU LIKE CALL IT 
TRIBALISM OR WHATEVER IT IS THE 
SUPPORT OF HAVING PEOPLE AROUND YOU 
WHO CAN HELP IT CAN BE ABOUT 
BABYSITTING OR WATERING YOUR PLANTS 
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT WE'VE BEEN 
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SA HAVE 
BEEN DESIGNING THIS HOUSING 
DEVELOPMENT IN GATESHEAD THE MAIN 
THING ABOUT IT WAS ABOUT HAVING 
POCKET PARKS LIKE LITTLE PARKS 
WHERE PEOPLE'S BACK GARDENS BACKED 
ON TO EACH OTHER WITH COMMUNAL 
BARBECUES AND IT WORKED PEOPLE SET 
UP THEIR OWN INTERNET AND SET UP 
BIKE CLUBS AND RUNNING CLUBS AND IT 
WORKS AS A COMMUNITY AT THE SAME 
TIME WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DO A 
DEVELOPMENT IN DART IN DARTFORD AND 
THERE WE HAVE BEEN TOLD WE CAN'T 
DO THE SAME THINGS AS WE DID IN 
GATESHEAD IT WON'T WORK DOWN HERE 
YOU CAN OPT IN OR OUT OF THE 
COMMUNITY OF WHICH YOU LIVE AND 
EVERYBODY RESPECTS YOU IF YOU DON'T 
WANT TO GO TO THE POCKET PARK IF 
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOCK ON YOUR 
NEIGHBOUR'S DOOR AND LOOK AFTER 
THEIR WRETCHED FISH FOOL YOU DON'T 
HAVE TO 
YOU NEED CHOICE 
YOU HAVE THAT CHOICE IN THE SOUTH 
OF ENGLAND NOBODY FROWNS ON YOU IF 
YOU KEEP YOURSELF TO YOURSELF IF 
YOU WANT TO OPT IN YOU CAN OPT IN 
VERY WELL B. P. 
WHY ARE NORTHERNERS 
FRIENDLIER WAYNE 
I'VE GONE 
THROUGH LIFE TRYING TO FIGHT THE 
IDEA THAT WE ARE FRIENDLY BUT WHEN 
YOU MEET MAXWELL YOU REALISE THAT 
WE ARE 
ANYBODY IS FRIENDLIER THAN MAXWELL 
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THING THAT 
HUMAN BEINGS HAVE DONE IS LIVE AND 
GET ON TOGETHER THIS IS THE FIRST 
YEAR THAT MORE PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN 
TO LIVE IN CITIES THAN LIFE OUTSIDE 
CITIES IF WE CAN TAKE A LEAF FROM 
THE NORTHERNERS AND BECOME MORE 
COMMUNAL THE WORLD WOULD BE A 
BETTER PLACE AND THE THING IS THAT 
I THINK THAT A LOT OF SOUTHERNERS 
WATCHING THIS WILL THINK COMMUNITY 
IS A STRONG THING AND WE CAN'T WE 
CAN HAVE A LAUGH AND AND POOH POOH 
IT BUT IT IS IMPORTANT SUPPORT 
AND GETTING ON WITH YOUR NEIGHBOURS 
AND YOUR COMMUNITY IS IMPORTANT 
YOU WILL NEED THEM SOME DAY MAXWELL 
HAVE YOU LIVED IN CITY OTHER 
THAN A SOUTHERN CITY 
I LIVED IN 
ABERDEEN WHEN I WAS AT UNIVERSITY 
THAT WAS A FRIENDLY PLACE BUT I 
FIND LONDON FRIENDLY EVERYWHERE I 
GO PEOPLE WAVE AT ME AND WISH ME 
GOOD DAY 
ARE THEY WAVING OR SHAKING THEIR 
FISTS 
THEY ARE BEING FRIENDLY BUT FISTS ON THE OTHER HAND IF I WANT TO BE 
QUIET YOU GET IN THE TAXI AND IF 
YOU WANT TO TALK TO THE TAXI DRIVER 
HE WILL TALK TO YOU IF YOU DON'T 
YOU WILL RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY AND 
SILENCE THE SAME IS HAPPENING IN 
SOCIETY IF YOU WANT TO KNOW YOUR 
NEIGHBOURS YOU CAN NOBODY THINKS 
YOU ARE STAND OFFISH I LIKE THE 
COMMUNITIES I LIVE AND I KNOW A LOT 
OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES IN 
WHICH I LIVE IF I HADN'T WANTED 
PEOPLE WOULDN'T GO WHO IS THAT 
SNOBBY MAN MAN WALKING DOWN THE 
STREET 
THERE IS SOMETHING NICE STREET ABOUT BEING WELCOMED IN A COMMUNITY 
I DON'T FIND THAT HAPPENS IN LONDON 
IT DID HAPPEN IN LEEDS BARNSLEY 
AND LIVERPOOL 
IT HAPPENS IN POCKETS A LOT OF IT 
IS TO DO WITH US BUILDING PLACES 
THAT TAKE AWAY COMMUNITY 
YOU ARE AN ARCHITECT AND YOU KNOW 
SOME OF THE MISTAKES WE WE MADE 
NOT YOU PERSONALLY 
IT WASN'T ME 
THE SOUTH WAS HIT MORE THAN THE 
NORTH THE NORTH BECAUSE IT NEVER 
HAD A LOT OF THE ECONOMIC BUOYANCY 
THAT THE SOUTH WENT THROUGH IT 
RETAINED A LOT OF THE STREETS THAT 
ALLOW YOU TO HAVE A COMMUNITY AND 
WE TOOK SO MUCH OF THAT AWAY DOWN 
HERE IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT PEOPLE 
IT IS ABOUT ENVIRONMENT AS WELL 
THERE WE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE IT 
THERE IS LOADS TO TALK ABOUT 
THAT'S A GOOD POINT 
HOLD IT FOR THE NEXT HOUR BECAUSE 
WE WILL BE BACK 
THERE IS MORE COMMUNITY IN A CUL 
DE S. A. C. THAN ON A MAIN ROAD 
YOU ARE FRIENDS WITH YOUR 
NEIGHBOURS 
I WASN'T WHERE I LIVED NEIGHBOURS BEFORE BUT I AM NOW 
EVERYBODY ON ONE SIDE OF OUR LANE 
ON THE OTHER SIDE WE DON'T SEE 
THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE BEHIND 
ELECTRIC GATES 
THAT'S WHY 
LET US NOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK YOU 
ALREADY ARE KNOW THE MAIN 
STORIES MORTGAGE LENDERS WILL BE 
ASKED TO GIVE HOMEOWNERS A LIFELINE 
WHEN HE MEETS WITH THEM LATER TODAY 
AND THE RBS IS HOPING TO RAISE 
BILLIONS OF POUNDS FROM SHAREDERS 
AND NORTHERN IRELAND IS SO 
CONCERNED ABOUT DEATHS CAUSED BY 
YOUNG DRIVERS IT IS CONSIDERING 
BANNING TEENS DRIVING AT NIGHT LET 
US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK AND COULD BE 
WORK ACROSS THE REST OF THE U. K. 
FIRST LET'S CATCH UP WITH THE 
WEATHER 
GOOD MORNING THE SPRING BLOSSOM IS 
OUT AND THE BIRDS ARE SINGING AND 
THE SUN WILL SHINE IN MANY PARTS OF 
THE COUNTRY TODAY AND AT LONG LAST 
IT WILL FEEL LIKE SPRING BUT THERE 
IS QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD OUT THERE 
AT THE MOMENT ACROSS MANY PARTS OF 
THE U. K. IT IS IN THE FORM OF HIGH 
CLOUD AND IT IS SLOWLY NUDGING 
WESTWARDS AND NORTHWARDS THE WORST 
AFFECTED PLACES ARE DEVON AND 
CORNWALL AND PARTS OF WALES AND 
LESS AFFECTED ARE CENTRAL PARTS OF 
ENGLAND AND WESTERN SCOTLAND BUT 
BY THIS AFTERNOON MORE SUNSHINE 
WILL WIN THROUGH 
THERE IS A BREEZE COMING IN FROM 
SOUTH EASTERLY DIRECTION MAKING IT 
FEEL COOL ON THE NORTH SEA COASTS 
BUT FOURTEEN DEGREES IN GLASGOW IS NOT 
TOO BAD ONCE THE SUN IS OUT AND 
FURTHER SOUTH AGAIN ALONG THE 
EASTERN COASTS THE BREEZE WILL 
COOL TEMPERATURES BUT INLAND 
TEMPERATURES COULD REACH THE MID 
SIXTIES FAHRENHEIT OR EIGHTEEN CELSIUS 
ACROSS DEVON AND CORNWALL LATER ON 
AS WELL AS THE FAR WEST OF WALES 
BIT MORE CLOUD WILL TRUNDLE IN AND 
A SIMILAR STORY IN THE WEST OF 
NORTHERN IRELAND THAT CLOUD IS IN 
ADVANCE OF THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM 
SO WHILE WE'LL BE DRY TOT WE WON'T 
STAY DRY TONIGHT THE RAIN WILL 
PUSH IN ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
THE SOUTH WEST THIS EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT AND THEN TOMORROW 
MORNING IT WILL REACH WESTERN 
SCOTLAND AND WESTERN PARTS OF 
ENGLAND ENGLAND TOMORROW MORNING MORE IN THE WAY 
OF RAIN AROUND WESTERN SCOTLAND 
THE MIDLANDS AND THE SOUTH EAST 
WILL START OFF WET DURING BREAKFAST 
TIME BUT IT WILL CLEAR AWAY AND 
SKIES WILL SLOWLY BRIGHTEN BUT 
ONCE THE SUN COMES OUT AND THE RAIN 
CLEARS OFF TEMPERATURES WILL REACH 
SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN DEGREES 
NOW DECLAN 
HELLO TWO BIG STORIES WE'VE BEEN 
FOLLOWING SINCE SEVEN A M. FIRST OF ALL 
PARPTS AND FAIRLY BIG HINT THAT 
AIRPORTS AND A FAIRLY BIG HINT THAT 
B. A. A. COULD BE BROKEN UP 
THE OWNERSHIP OF ALL THE MAJOR 
AIRPORTS IS NOT GOOD FOR AIRLINES 
AND PASSENGERS BUT THE BODY 
STRESSES IT HAS NOT REACHED ANY 
CONCLUSIONS JUST YET SO IT HAS 
MADE THE HINT BUT WILL COME BACK 
TO IT IN AUGUST AND CONFIRMATION 
FROM THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND 
THAT IT IS TO RAISE TWELVE BILLION 
FROM THE SHAREHOLDERS BY SELLING 
NEW SHARES THAT'S NOT THE ONLY 
THING IT HAS SAID THIS MORNING IT 
ALSO SAID IT IS CUTTING THE VALUE 
OF INVESTMENTS IT MADE 
PARTICULARLY IN U. S. MORTGAGE DEBT 
BY SIX BILLION AND IT IS ALSO 
CONSIDERING THE SALE OF ITS 
INSURANCE BUSINESS INCLUDING 
DIRECT LINE THAT COULD RAISE IT FOUR 
BILLION BILLION LET'S TALK TO RALPH SILVA FROM 
TOWER GROUP 
THE STORY FROM THE BANKS IS SO 
DIFFERENT FROM LAST YEAR THIS IS 
ALL ABOUT HERE HOARDING MONEY AND 
PUTTING AWAY BIG FINANCIAL 
CUSHION TO GET THROUGH THE TOUGH 
TIMES 
THAT'S RIGHT IT IS TIMES COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX SEVENTHS 
AND RBS ONLY NEED TWELVE BILLION AND 
THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO GET FOUR 
BILLION FROM ASSET SELLS SALES BUT BUT SAY ONLY BUT IF THEY ARE 
SELLING OFF VARIOUS DIVISIONS IT 
LEAVES SIXTEEN BILLION AND THEY'RE 
CUTTING IT DOWN TO TEN BILLION THEY 
DIDN'T HAVE THIS TIME A WEEK AGO 
THAT'S TRUE BUT THEY'RE COUNTING 
ON THE CRISIS TO CONTINUE 
THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR SO THEY NEEDED 
SUFFICIENT MONEY TO GET THEM 
THROUGH TO THE END OF THIS YEAR 
AND I THINK THEY'VE BUILT THAT UP 
EVEN IF THEY SAY THE INVESTMENTS 
THEY'VE MADE HAVE GONE SOUR AND IT 
WILL COST THEM SIX BILLION THEY ARE 
STILL MAKING MONEY SO THAT IS NOT 
AS BAD AS THE BIG AMERICAN BANKS 
OR SOME OF THEM 
YES WE SHOULDN'T 
FEEL SORRY FOR THE EUROPEAN BANKS 
THEY ARE DOING BADLY IN ONE LINE OF 
BUSINESS BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS 
DOING GOOD 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL KEEP 
ABREAST OF ALL THESE STORIES ON THE

ISN'T IT A SIN TO COMMIT SUICIDE 
IF YOU ARE A CATHOLIC

SIN TO RUN SOMEBODY DOWN 
DELIBERATELY WITH YOUR TRAIN IF 
YOU ARE A HUMAN BEING 
THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL ONE THERE 
WERE PROTESTS AT THE PREMIERE LAST 
NIGHT AND WE WILL TALK TO ONE OF 
THE STARS OF THREE AND OUT AND FIND 
OUT WHAT THE FUSS IS ABOUT 
TIME FOR THE NEWS WHERE YOU ARE 
GOOD MORNING FROM B. B. C. LONDON NEWS 
THE MET HAS REVEALED THAT SECURITY 
FOR THE LONDON LEG OF THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH RELAY COST ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND 
THE OPERATION EARLIER THIS MONTH 
INVOLVED NEARLY TWO THOUSAND OFFICERS AND 
THERE WERE THIRTY SEVEN ARRESTS 
WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE TRAVEL 
NEWS NOW GOOD MORNING THERE ARE PROBLEMS 
UNFORTUNATELY ON THE CENTRAL LINE 
AT THE MOMENT DUE TO LACK OF 
AVAILABLE TRAINS THERE ARE MINOR 
DELAYS OCCURRING 
AND ON THE ROADS THE A TWENTY FOUR IN SOUTH 
LONDON IT HAS CLEARED IN THE LAST 
COUPLE OF MINUTES BUT THERE WAS AN 
ACCIDENT THERE FEW MINUTES AGO 
BUT IT IS CLEARED NOW THE M. TWENTY FIVE 
CLOCK WISE THERE IS BROKEN DOWN 
CAR IN LANE THREE WHICH IS CAUSING 
DELAYS AND IT IS IN DANGEROUS 
SPOT SO WATCH OUT FOR THAT AND 
THERE ARE DELAYS AT THE BLACK WALL 
TUNNEL 
B. A. A.'S OWNERSHIP OF THREE AIRPORTS 
IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND ADVERSELY 
AFFECT COMPETITION THE COMPETITION 
COMMISSION SAYS B. A. A.'S MONOPOLY MAY 
NOT BE BEST SERVING AIRLINES OR 
PASSENGERS PASSENGERS AND STAYING WITH AVIATION HUNDREDS 
OF PEOPLE GATHERED AT PUBLIC 
MEETINGS LAST NIGHT TO PROTEST 
AGAINST CHANGES TO THE FLIGHT PATHS 
NORTH OF LONDON THE AVIATION GROUP 
SAYS MOVING FLIGHT PATHS WILL 
REDUCE NOISE OVER TOWNS BUT IT 
DOES ADMIT THAT SOME WILL SUFFER AN 
INCREASE IN NOISE 
DESPITE THE FACT 
THAT ELSEWHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO 
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COVERED 
AND CLAIM THEY CAN REDUCE IT BY TEN PER CENT 
BUT HERE AT LUTON THERE ARE THREE 
TIMES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED 
AND IT IS HUGE 
THE FIFTEENTH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF 
TEENAGER STEPHEN LAWRENCE WILL BE 
MARKED WITH A SPECIAL MEMORIAL 
SERVICE IN LONDON TODAY STEPHEN 
WAS STABBED TO DEATH WHILE WAITING 
FOR A BUS IN SOUTH EAST LONDON AND 
NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN CONVICTED OF 
HIS MURDER 
WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
WEATHERMENT 
GOOD MORNING A DECENT DAY OF 
WEATHER COMING UP TODAY WE START 
WITH DOTTED CLOUD AND PATCHES OF 
LOW CLOUD BUT IT WILL SOON CLEAR 
AND THEN MOST OF US WILL HAVE A 
FINE DAY WITH LONG SPELLS OF SEASON 
SHINE WITH THE EASTERLY BREEZE 
SOME AREAS OF THE THAMES ESTUARY 
COULD FEEL A LITTLE CHILLY BUT FOR 
MOST OF US TEMPERATURES WILL REACH 
SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN DEGREES 
THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT CLEAR 
SPELLS AT FIRST BUT DURING THE 
SECOND HALF OF THE NIGHT CLOUD WILL 
SPREAD IN FROM THE WEST BRINGING 
RAIN TO WESTERN AREAS AND THAT 
RAIN WILL SPREAD ACROSS ALL AREAS 
FOR WEDNESDAY MORNING BUT IT 
SHOULD CLEAR ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON 
AND THERE WILL BE A RETURN OF THE 
SUNSHINE WE'LL BE BACK IN HALF AN 
HOUR 
THIS IS BREAKFAST CAN MORE BE DONE 
TO HELP STRUGGLING HOME OWNERS THE 
CHANCELLORS ASKS MORTGAGE LENDERS 
TO CUT THEIR RATES 
GOOD MORNING IT'S TUESDAY TWENTY SECOND 
APRIL ALSO AHEAD IN THE PROGRAMME 
COULD IT BE THE KNOCK OUT PUNCH FOR 
HILLARY CLINTON THAT'S MEANT TO BE 
HER WITH BARACK OBAMA THERE IS A 
KEY VOTE TONIGHT IN PENNSYLVANIA 
MAKING IT EASIER TO TIE THE KNOT IN 
CHURCH NEW RULES TO GET MORE 
COUPLES TO EXCHANGE VOWS AT THE 
ALTER ALTER LONDON IS ABOUT TO CHOOSE ITS NEXT 
MAYOR AND WE WILL BE EXPLAINING WHY 
IT MATTERS WAY BEYOND THE 
CONGESTION ZONE 
AS NORTHERN IRELAND DISCUSSES A 
CURFEW FOR TEENAGE DRIVERS WE ARE 
HEARING FROM A BEREAVED MOTHER 
ABOUT THE IMPACT ONE DRIVER HAD ON 
HER LIFE 
SOMETIMES I FEEL HE NOT 
ONLY STOLE HER FUTURE BUT HE STOLE 
HER PAST FROM ME AS WELL BECAUSE I 
FIND IT SO PAINFUL TO THINK ABOUT 
HER HER EWAN MCGREGOR TELLS BREAKFAST ABOUT 
BEING TREATED FOR SKIN CANCER AHEAD 
OF HIS NEW FILM RELEASE ALL THE 
LATEST BUSINESS AND WEATHER FIRST 
TO OUR MAIN STORY THE CHANCELLOR 
ALISTAIR DARLING IS TO MEET 
MORTGAGE LENDERS LATER TODAY TO 
URGE THEM TO DO MORE TO TRY TO HELP 
STRUGGLING BORROWERS HE WANTS TO 
FIND WAYS OF HELPING THOSE WHO ARE 
STRUGGLING TO MEET REPAYMENTS 
LENDERS SAY THERE IS NO EASY 
SOLUTION SOLUTION IT'S HARD TO SMILE WHEN READING A 
MORTGAGE OFFER THESE DAYS AND 
NADIA IS FAR FROM ALONE SHE CAN 
ONLY AFFORD THE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS 
ON HER NEW HOME IF SHE JUST PAYS 
OFF THE INTEREST IT MEANS THE 
AMOUNT SHE OWES ISN'T GOING DOWN 
AND RECENT FALLS IN THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND BASE RATE HAVEN'T HELPED 
IT IS DISAPPOINTING THAT THE 
LENDERS CAN'T GIVE US THE REDUCED 
RATE THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAVE NOW 
MADE RECENTLY MADE BECAUSE IT 
WOULD BENEFIT US ME AS A HOME 
OWNER SWITCHING TO A REPAYMENT 
MORTGAGE RATHER THAN INTEREST ONLY 
OTHER BORROWERS ARE EVEN WORSE OFF 
UNABLE TO GET AN AFFORDABLE 
MORTGAGE AT ALL TODAY LENDERS WILL 
COME UNDER MORE PRESSURE TO HELP 
THEM OUT THE CHANCELLOR IS MEETING 
BANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES TO 
DISCUSS HOW THEY CAN PASS ON THE 
BENEFITS OF FALLING INTEREST RATES 
THE DAY AFTER THEY WERE GIVEN 
HELPING HAND THEMSELVES WITH THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND'S FIFTY BILLION PLAN 
TO HELP LENDERS SWAP MORTGAGE DEBT 
FOR GOVERNMENT BONDS BUT IT SEEMS 
BETTER RATES FOR CONSUMERS ARE 
STILL FAR FROM GUARANTEED 
IT'S NOT 
PART OF THE DEAL THAT THEY MUST BE 
PASSED ON MOST OF THE LARGE 
LENDERS HAVE PASSED THEM ON IN 
RECENT BASE RATE CUTS WE HAVE 
EMPHASISED TO THE CHANCELLOR BEFORE 
THE COST OF FUNDS AREN'T LINKED TO 
THE BASE RATE ALONE IT HAS TO BE 
LOOKED AT CAREFULFULLY 
THE ADVICE 
FOR ANYONE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR 
MORTGAGE IS TO CONTACT THEIR LENDER 
AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN LIKE NADIA 
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO FIND A WAY TO 
REDUCE THEIR PAYMENTS WITHOUT 
FALLING INTO ARREARS 
MORE NEWS ON THE BUSINESS AND 
FINANCIAL FRONT BECAUSE WITHIN THE 
LAST HOUR WE HAVE HAD CONFIRMATION 
FROM THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND 
ABOUT HOW THEY INTEND TO BOLSTER 
THEIR FINANCES DECLAN CAN TELL US 
ABOUT THE PLAN 
SEVEN SHAREHOLDERS ARE GOING TO FEEL 
THE PAIN OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH AT 
RBS THEY ARE GOING TO BE ASKED TO 
COULD HAVE UP TWELVE BILLION TO FATTEN 
UP THE BANKS FINANCIAL CUSHION 
THERE IS TALK IT MIGHT SELL ITS 
INSURANCE BUSINESS RBS SAYS IT IS 
CONSIDERING A SALE OF ITS INSURANCE 
BUSINESS WHICH INCLUDES DIRECT 
LINE THAT COULD GO FOR AS MUCH AS 
FOUR BILLION THE THE BANK SAYS THAT 
INVESTMENTS THAT IT'S MADE IN 
AMERICAN MORTGAGE DEBT WHICH HAVE 
GONE SOUR WILL COST IT ANOTHER SIX 
BILLION THIS YEAR THREE SEPARATE 
STRANDS FROM RBS TODAY THE 
SHAREHOLDERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
COULD HAVE UP TWELVE BILLION THEY 
MIGHT SELL THE INSURANCE BUSINESS 
AND VALUE OF INVESTMENTS GOING 
WRONG WILL COST THEM SIX BILLION BY 
THE WAY ALL THE TOP BOSSES KEEP 
THEIR JOBS 
GORDON BROWN'S EFFORTS TO HEAD OFF 
LOOK TO HAVE SUFFERED A 
SIGNIFICANT BLOW BLOW BECAUSE IT 
APPEARS ENOUGH LABOUR M. P.'S TO DEFEAT 
THE GOVERNMENT HAVE SIGNED A REBEL 
AMEND LAST NIGHT MR. BROWN TOLD HIS 
BACKBENCHERS HE UNDERSTOOD THEIR 
CONCERNS BUT SAID THEY SHOULD SHOW 
UNITY SO CLOSE TO THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS ELECTIONS LET'S TURN OUR ATTENTION TO 
ELECTIONS OF A DIFFERENT KIND IN 
AMERICA THE INCREASINGLY BITTER 
BATTLE BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND 
BARACK OBAMA FOR THE DEMOCRATIC 
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION MOVES TO 
PENNSYLVANIA TODAY HILLARY CLINTON 
WILL NEED A VERY CONVINCING VICTORY 
TO KEEP HER CAMPAIGN ALIVE 
IT IS THE TOUGHEST JOB IN THE WORLD 
THE TONE HAS BECOME MORE EXTREME 
AND CONFRONTATIONAL HILLARY 
CLINTON'S LATEST T. V. COMMERCIAL 
USING IMAGES OF PEARL HARBOUR AND 
OSAMA BIN LADEN TO SUGGEST ONLY SHE 
COULD WITH STAND THE PRESSURES OF 
OFFICE WHILE BARACK OBAMA HAS 
RESORTED TO OLD STYLE NEGATIVE 
ATTACKS 
BUILD UP TO PENNSYLVANIA HAS LOOKED 
INCREASINGLY LIKE A NO HOLDS BARRED 
CONTEST THIS PRIME TIME T. V. 
WRESTLING SHOW EVEN HAD ANIMATED 
VERSIONS OF THE CANNED DAYS 
BATTLING IT OUT IN THE RING IT 
HASN'T COME TO THAT BUT THEIR 
DIRECT APPEAL TO THE SHOW'S FANS 
ADDS TO A SENSE OF DESPERATION 
YOU CAN CALL ME HILL ROD THIS 
ELECTION IS STARTING TO FEEL A LOT 
LIKE KING OF THE RING THE ONLY 
DIFFERENCE THE LAST MAN STANDING 
MAY JUST BE A WOMAN 
ALL THE FORCES OF DIVISION AND 
DESTRUCTION THAT HAVE STOPPED US 
FROM MAKING PROGRESS FOR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE I HAVE ONE 
QUESTION DO YOU SMELL WHAT BARACK 
IS COOKING 
IN SIX WEEKS OF CAMPAIGNING BOTH 
CANDIDATES HAVE GONE TO 
EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS TO SHOW THEY 
ARE IN TUNE WITH ORDINARY VOTERS 
BUT IT IS HILLARY CLINTON WHO NEEDS 
THE CONVINCING WIN WIN JUST TO 
STAY IN THE RACE 
A CHANGE IN THE LAW IS BEFORE 
CONSIDERED TO MAKE IT EDSIER FOR 
PEOPLE TO MARRY IN CHURCH AT THE 
MOMENT ANGLICAN CHURCH RULES SAY 
YOU MUST LIVE IN THE PARISH OR 
ATTEND CHURN REGULARLY TO GET 
MARRIED THERE CRITICS SAY THE 
CHANGE WILL PUT MORE PRESSURE ON 
PICTURE POST CARD CHURCHES 
THIS LOOKS LIKE A FILM SET AND HAS 
OFTEN BEEN USED AS ONE THE CURRENT 
RULES SAY YOU MUST LIVE IN THE 
PARISH OR ATTEND THE CHURCH 
REGULARLY AND THE VICAR'S STRICT 
INTERPRETATION OF THEM HAS HELPED 
FUEL A FIERCE DISPUTE IN THIS 
SLEEPLY CORNER OF THE COUNTRY BUT 
SOME LOCAL PEOPLE BELIEVE WEDDING 
TOURISM SHOULD BE RESISTED PEOPLE PEOPLE COME FOR SPIRITUAL REASONS AND IT 
IS A PEACEFUL CHURCH TO JUST COME 
BECAUSE IT LOOKS PRETTY IN YOUR 
PICTURES TO ME IS ALMOST 
BLASPHEMOUS 
ALTHOUGH CHOCOLATE BOX BLASPHEMOUS VILLAGES ARE IN DEMAND RELIGIOUS 
MARRIAGES ARE IN STEEP DECLINE THE 
CHURCH OF ENGLAND IS RAPIDLY LOSING 
ITS SHARE 
CONFIRMATION IS EXPECTED TODAY OF A 
DRAMATIC RELAXATION IN THE RULES 
FROM THE AUTUMN YOU WILL PROBABLY 
BE ABLE TO MARRY IN ANY PARISH IF 
YOU LIVED THERE FOR AT LEAST SIX 
MONTHS IF YOUR PARENTS LIVE THERE 
OR IF YOU GRANDPARENTS WERE MARRIED 
THERE IT WILL INCREASE THE 
PRESSURE ON THE PRETTIEST PARISHES 
BUT THE CHURCH SAYS IT SHOULD HELP 
TO PUT RELIGION BACK INTO MARRIAGE 
THERE ARE TALKS PLANNED TODAY TO 
TRY TO PREVENT A STRIKE TAKING 
PLACE AT THE GRANGEMOUTH OIL 
REFINERY MANAGEMENT ARE CONTINUING 
TO SHUT DOWN PRODUCTION AT THE SITE 
UP TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WORKERS PLAN TO WALK 
OUT FOR TWO DAYS FROM SUNDAY IN A 
ROW OVER PENSIONS A COMMON DRUG FOR 
TREATING CANCER HAS BEEN LINKED BY 
RESEARCHERS TO BRAIN DAMAGE IN MICE 
THE CHEMOTHERAPY DRUG CALLED IS 
OFTEN USED AS PART OF A COCKTAIL OF 
CHEMICALS TO TREAT SOME CANCERS 
CHEMOTHERAPY HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN 
ASSOCIATED WITH MEMORY LOSS AND 
DEMENTIA EWAN MCGREGOR HAS SPOKEN 
PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT 
BEING DIAGNOSED WITH SKIN CANCER 
HE TOLD THE B. B. C. HE HAS BEEN GIVEN 
THE ALL CLEAR AFTER HAVING TWO 
MOLES REMOVED FROM HIS FACE 
I WENT 
TO HAVE THEM CHECKED YOU HAVE TO 
BE CAREFUL IF YOU ARE PALE SKINNED 
AND YOU HAVE MOLES SO I WENT TO 
SEE A SPECIALIST WHO THOUGHT THEY 
WERE BETTER TO BE REMOVED AND 
INDEED HE WAS CORRECT 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT M. P. LEMBIT OPIK 
IS TO MARRY HIS CHEEKY GIRLFRIEND 
AFTER PROPOSING IN ROME 
THE COUPLE WHO MET IN TWO THOUSAND SIX ON A T. V. 
PROGRAMME PLAN TO MARRY NEXT YEAR 
OR MAYBE THE YEAR AFTER 
CHEEKY CHEEKY 
THOSE ARE THE MAIN STORIES THIS 
MORNING MORNING YOUNG DRIVERS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
COULD BE BANNED FROM DRIVING AFTER 
DARK OR FROM CARRYING TEENAGE 
PASSENGERS UNDER NEW PLANS BEING 
CONSIDERED BY THE ASSEM BUILD THERE 
IT IS HOPED THE MOVE WILL HELP CUT 
NUMBER OF ROAD DEATHS WHICH ARE 
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOR THE UNDER 
TWENTIES NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO MARGARET 
DAVIDSON WAS KILLED BY A NINETEEN YEAR 
OLD DRIVER WHO WAS OVER TAKING ON 
THE BROW OF HILL AT SEVENTY M. P. H. HE WAS 
SENTENCED TO FOUR YEARS IN JAIL 
HER MOTHER ELIZABETH TOLD BREAKFAST 
SHE STILL STRUGGLES TO COME TO 
TERMS WITH HER DAUGHTER'S DEATH IT IT IS OVERWHELMING AT TIMES SOMETIMES 
IT JUST OVERWE WILL MS. ME AND IT IS 
IT IS ALMOST LIKE PARALYSIS PEOPLE 
SAY THINGS TO YOU LIKE WELL YOU 
HAVE YOUR MEMORIES THEY WILL BRING 
YOU COMFORT BUT YOU KNOW THE SAD 
THING ABOUT IT IS AS YET THEY 
DON'T REALLY BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK 
AT PHOTOGRAPHS OF HER MY HEART 
BREAKS AND I THINK I KNOW HOW IT 
ALL FINISHES AND I KNOW HER 
INTENTION WAS TO COME HOME TO COME 
BACK TO SCOTLAND AND WE WERE 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT SHE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN HOME IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
THAT WASN'T TO BE 
JOINING US IN THE STUDIO TO DISCUSS 
THESE PLANS IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS 
SHEILA RANGER FROM THE R. A. C. 
FOUNDATION AND MALCOLM TARLING FROM 
THE ASSOCIATION OF BRITISH INSURERS 
VERY EARLY DAYS FOR THIS PLAN BUT 
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IT IS IT 
IS SUGGESTING STOPPING UNDER TWENTIES 
DRIVING BETWEEN NINE HUNDRED AT NIGHT AND 
SIX ZERO ZERO A M. IN THE MORNING AND 
PREVENTING THEM CARRYING TEENAGE 
PASSENGERS AT ANY TIME 
IT IS A 
SLEDGE HAMMER TO CRACK A NUT TOO 
MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DYING ON THE 
ROADS AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE 
DONE BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS 
GOING TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE OUR RUE 
IS EDUCATION AND CREATING THAT SAFE 
ATTITUDE IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD 
THERE IS NO WAY THAT OVERTAKING ON 
A BLIND HILL AT SEVENTY M. P. H. IS SAFE BUT 
BANNING PEOPLE FROM DRIVING AT 
NIGHT THAT IS NOT GOING TO TACKLE 
THAT WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING IS 
TEACHING YOUNG PEOPLE EARLY ON 
ABOUT HOW TO BE A SAFE AND 
RESPONSIBLE MOTORIST 
YOU SAY THESE 
CHANGES DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH 
BANNING NIGHT TIME DRIVING IS 
DRACONIAN BUT WHAT WE THINK IS 
NEEDED ARE THREE KEY THINGS WE 
NEED A MINIMUM ONE YEAR LEARNING 
PERIOD TO HELP YOUNG DRIVERS WHEN 
THEY PASS THEIR TEST BE BETTER 
EQUIPPED WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE 
HAVE A MORE STRUCTURED LEARNING 
PROGRAMME SO LEARNERS GET 
EXPERIENCE OF DRIVING AT NIGHT AND 
THIRDLY WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT 
RESTRICTIONS ON THE NUMBER OF 
PASSENGERS NEWLY QUALIFIED CAN 
CARRY IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS THAT THAT IS AN INTERESTING THEORY ABOUT THE 
DISTRACTIONS THAT PASSENGERS HAVE 
ON YOUNG DRIVERS L. L. REMEMBER SEEING 
A DOCUMENTARY AND IT WAS SAYING 
TEENAGE BOYS BRAINS AND GIRLS 
HAVE YET TO DEVELOP PROPERLY AND SO 
SO IF THEY ARE DISTRACTED WHILE 
DRIVING THAT IS THE VERY THING 
THAT CAN CAUSE ACCIDENTS HAVING HAVING YOUR FRIENDS IN THE CAR CAN BE A 
TEMPTATION TO SHOW OFF BUT OF 
COURSE IT MEANS ONE PERSON CAN 
DRIVE THREE FRIENDS TO THE PUB OR A 
PARTY IT WILL MEAN LESS DANGER OF 
DRINK DRIVING AGAIN WE WOULD THINK 
THAT PEER PRESSURE CAN BE POSITIVE 
AS WELL AS NEGATIVE IF IF YOUNG 
PEOPLE IN THE CAR CAN SAY TO THE 
DRIVER YOU ARE GOING FAR TOO FAST 
HERE WE CAN HAVE A POSITIVE CIRCLE 
RATHER THAN A VICIOUS ONE 
YOU ARE 
SUGGESTING THAT IF YOU HAVE SINGLE 
DRIVERS IN CARS THEY WILL BE LESS 
RESPONSIBLE ABOUT DRINK DRIVING 
THAT IS A BIG ASSUMPTION 
IT IS 
MORE OF A RISK IF YOU CAN TAKE 
THREE OR FOUR PASSENGERS TO WHERE 
YOU ARE GOING OR FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE 
HAVE TO TAKE FOUR CARS WHERE EVER 
THEY ARE GOING OUR ARGUMENT WOULD 
BE THESE THINGS ARE VERY DRACONIAN 
THEY ARE GOING TO HIT A A LARGE 
NUMBER OF YOUNG DRIVERS SO LET'S 
TRY AND CHANGE THE ATTITUDES OF THE 
SMALL NUMBER RATHER THAN MAKE LIFE 
DIFFICULT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF 
GOOD HONEST RESPONSIBLE YOUNG 
PEOPLE 
THERE 
ARE OTHER IDEAS 
THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING FLOATED AROUND ONE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO LESSONS FOR A FULL 
YEAR WHICH IS SOMETHING YOU 
SUPPORT AND ANOTHER IS SOMETHING 
THEY DO IN NEW ZEALAND WHERE YOU 
DON'T ACTUALLY GET YOUR FULL 
LICENCE BEFORE TWENTY FIVE UNLESS YOU HAVE 
PASSED A SERIES OF TESTS YOU GET A 
A PROVISIONAL LICENCE BUT YOU HAVE 
TO KEEP TAKING LESSONS 
WE DON'T 
WANT TO KEEP YOUNG DRIVERS OFF THE 
ROAD WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TODAY'S 
YOUNG DRIVERS BECOME TOMORROW'S 
MATURE DRIVERS WE DEFINITELY 
SUPPORT THE IDEA OF A MINIMUM ONE 
YEAR LEARNING PERIOD THE PROBLEM 
IS THAT LACK OF EXPERIENCE IT IS 
PEER PRESSURE EVERY DAY FOUR 
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE KILLED 
OR SERIOUSLY INJURED IN ACCIDENTS 
INVOLVING YOUNG DRIVERS AND HICHBED 
THAT STATISTICS IS A TRAGEDY LIKE 
WE HAVE JUST HEARD 
DO YOU THINK IT 
IS BECAUSE THE BRAINS AREN'T 
DEVELOPED PROPERLY IS IT 
DISTRACTIONS IN THE CAR WHY DO YOU 
THINK MORE YOUNG DRIVERS DIE WE WE WOULD ARGUE PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG 
MEN THEIR AMBITION EXCEEDS THEIR 
EXPERIENCE AND THEY ARE GETTING 
INTO SITUATIONS THEY HAVEN'T YET 
LEARNED HOW TO HANDLE OVER 
CONFIDENCE THE FEELING IMMORTGAGE 
IMMORTGAGAL THOSE ARE THE THINGS 
THAT NEED TO BE TACKLED YOU CAN'T 
LEGISLATE FOR THOSE 
LET'S GET THE WEATHER NOW 
BOTTOMLEY AT LONG LAST A DIFFERENT 
FEEL TO THE WEATHER THROUGH THIS 
WEEK FORCE 
BOTTOMLEY WE ARE STARTING TO CUT 
OFF THE WIND WHICH HAS MEANT IT'S 
BEEN CHILLY FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS 
IN THE SUNSHINE IT WILL START TO 
FEEL MORE LIKE SPRING AS THE WIND 
STARTS TO EASE PARTICULARLY ACROSS 
SOUTHERN AREAS TO BEGIN WITH 
THERE WILL BE SUNSHINE AROUND 
PARTICULARLY TO THE SOUTH AND WEST 
OF THE U. K. AS YOU CAN SEE BY THE 
SATELLITE PICTURE STILL A FAIR 
AMOUNT OF CLOUD AT THE MOMENT MOST 
OF THAT IS HIGH CLOUD JUST 
TEMPERING THE SUNSHINE IN THE 
MORNING THERE IS LOW CLOUD TOO 
MAKING IT GRI ACROSS CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN PARTS OF ENGLAND THAT 
WILL STEADILY THIN AND BREAK 
THROUGH THE DAY FORCE 
BOTTOMLEY FIFTEEN DEGREES ACROSS 
SCOTLAND 
CERTAINLY IN EAST ANGLIA THE WIND 
IS MUCH LIGHTER THAN IT HAS BEEN IN 
RECENT DAYS ANYWHERE FOR LIVERPOOL 
MANCHESTER DOWN THROUGH BIRMINGHAM 
AND LONDON AND OXFORD WE HAVE 
TEMPERATURES CLIMBING TO SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN 
CELSIUS TEMPERATURES LIKE THAT 
COULD SET OFF A FEW SEA BREEZES IN 
THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND CLOUD 
GENERALLY BUILDING ACROSS DEVON AND 
CORNWALL AS IT WILL DO ACROSS 
WESTERN WALES THE REASON THE CLOUD 
HERE WILL START TO THICKEN UP IS 
BECAUSE WE HAVE A BAND OF RAIN 
PUSHING IN OFF THE ATLANTIC THAT 
IS SIGN OF A CHANGE THAT RAIN 
WILL PUSH ACROSS ALL BUT WESTERN 
SCOTLAND HERE IT COULD BE MISTY 
AND MURKY IT SHOULD BE FROST FREE 
TONIGHT TEMPERATURES NO LOWER THAN 
FIVE OR EIGHT AGREES INTO THE MORNING A 
BIT MORE IN THE WAY OF RAIN AROUND 
PARTS OF SCOTLAND NORTHERN ENGLAND 
AND THE SOUTH EAST THE RAIN WILL 
EASE OFF INTO THE AFTERNOON ACROSS 
THE WEST OF THE U. K. IT SHOULD BE 
DRY AND BRIGHT DAY AFTER SOME EARLY 
MIST AND FOG ONCE THE SUNSHINE 
COMES OUT DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 
THE DAY TEMPERATURES CLIMBING IN 
THE MIDTO HIGH TEENS WE WILL HOLD 
WITH THAT MILD WEATHER THROUGH THE 
REST OF THE WEEK WE DID PROMISE 
YOU THE EAGLE AT TWENTY PAST BUT THE 
EAGLE HAS NOT LANDED WHERE IS HE 
I DON'T KNOW YOU NEED YOUR LEATHER 
GLOVE TO DO THIS HE WILL BE HERE 
AROUND EIGHT THIRTY A M. 
STILL TO COME TRAIN DRIVERS 
PROTESTED AT THE FILM'S PREMIERE 
LAST NIGHT COLM MEANEY WILL BE 
HEAR TO TELL US ABOUT IT THE LADY 
IN RED NANCY D. LOLLIO IS GOING TO 
BE HEAR TO TELL US ABOUT HER WORK 
WITH THE RED CROSS AND TO SET THE 
RECORD STRAIGHT ABOUT SVEN SCLEERP 
I AM NOT GOING TO HAVE TO SING IT 
AGAIN LADY IN RED FROM NEW YORK 
FASHION TO NEW DELHI FACTORY SIX 
BRITISH YOUNGSTERS HAVE FOLLOWED 
THEIR FASHION ADDICTIONS RIGHT BACK 
TO THE FIRST STITCH THE TRANSITION 
WAS FAR FROM SEAMLESS A NEW B. B. C. 
SERIES CALLED BLOOD SWEAT AND T. 
SHIRTS FOLLOWS THE REALITY OF A 
DEVELOPING NATION LET'S SEE CLIP 
MY GOD I FEEL SO WEIRD AMRITA AMRITA GEORGINA AND MARK ARE STAYING WITH 
THE PRODUCTION WORKER LOLITA SHE 
MAKES JUST UNDER ONE POINT FIVE OH A DAY SHE 
SHARES A TWO BEDROOM HOUSE WITH HER 
FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE YOU TO SEE 
THIS IT'S THE BATHROOM SLASH SHOWER TO 
OH MY GOD 
THAT'S SICK FIRST FIRST IMPRESSIONS WELL IT'S VERY BASIC 
ISN'T IT 
CERTAINLY WAS GEORGIN TARY SCOTT 
IS HERE YOU ARE THE DARK HAIRED IN 
THAT CLIP YOU HAVE CHANGED SINCE 
THEN THIS WAS THE MOST FASCINATING 
REALITY SHOW I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG 
TIME IT REALLY DID TAKE YOU BACK 
TO REALITY DIDN'T IT 
IT DID L. 
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT 
TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT HOW OUR 
CLOTHES ARE MADE IS AN IMPORTANT 
THING 
TO MOST PEOPLE WATCHING IT THING AT THE BEGINNING ALL OF YOU DO 
SEEM A BIT WELL YOU HAVE MONEY 
YOU DON'T SPOILT L. WAS 
HESITATING TO SAY IT BUT EVEN YOUR 
DAD SAID YOU WERE SPOILT IN THE 
SHOW 
HE DID 
WHAT WAS IT LIKE SHOW BEING USED TO BUYING T. SHIRTS FOR 
POUND TIME AND THEN THROWING THEM 
AWAY TO GO TO INDIA AND SEE THEM 
BEING MADE 
IT'S A REAL SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM 
IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE 
ACTUALLY TO BE THERE AND DO IT 
OURSELVES IT'S REALLY INTENSE IT'S 
NOT JUST ABOUT MAKING THE CLOTHES 
THE IT'S THE EMOTIONAL THING THE 
REASON THEY PUT THEMSELVES THROUGH 
IT IS FOR THE LOVE OF THEIR FAMILY 
THEY CAN'T HAVE AN EDUCATION TO 
BETTER THEMSELVES LIKE WE CAN IT'S 
INTENSE 
LIKE MOST OF US YOU TOOK INTENSE CHEAP FASHION CLOTHES FOR GRANTED 
DIDN'T YOU 
I HAD READ A LOT OF ARTICLES THERE 
HAS BEEN STUFF IN THE PRESS SO I 
WAS STARTING TO BECOME AWARE ABOUT 
THINGS AND I KIND OF WAS TRYING TO 
CUT DOWN ON BUYING THINGS WHICH I 
KNEW WERE PROBABLY MADE IN 
UNSATISFACTORY CONDITIONS BUT 
THEN GOING AWAY AND DOING THIS 
EXPERIENCE FOR ME JUST KIND OF 
GAVE ME THE PASSION TO GO DO YOU 
KNOW WHAT IT'S NOT WORTH IT L. 
DON'T WANT THAT ENOUGH TO CONDONE 
THE CONDITIONS IT WAS MADE IN IF IF YOU DON'T BUY THE CLOTHES WHAT DO 
THEY DO FOR EMPLOYMENT 
THAT IS THE THING IT'S MORE ABOUT 
THE CONDITIONS THEY ARE WORKING IN 
IT IS REALLY INTENSE HAVING TO 
SLEEP BY YOUR MACHINE AND DO THAT 
EVERY SINGLE DAY 
YOU WERE DOING 
THAT YOU WEREN'T SNEAKING OFF TO A 
NICE HOTEL 
WE WERE LIVING IT 
THERE WAS ONE FACTORY WHERE THE 
WORKERS WERE SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR 
WE DID SO FOR THREE NIGHTS 
EIGHTEEN HOUR 
DAYS 
WE GOT DEVOURED BY MOSQUITOES DAYS THIS IS HOW TENS OF HUNDREDS OF 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIVE IN MANY 
PARTS OF THE WORLD DEFINITELY DEFINITELY WHEN WE WERE DRIVING THROUGH THE 
DIFFERENT PLACES TO SEE THE 
CONDITIONS THEY GOT A LOT WORSE 
THERE WAS PEOPLE LIVING IN TIN HUT 
NOT EVEN PROPER HOUSES EVERYWHERE 
YOU WENT THERE WAS RATS IT WAS A 
COMPLETE CULTURE SHOCK 
WHAT SEEMED 
TO BRING IT HOME TO YOU YOU WERE 
STAYING WITH FAMILIESS AS WELL L. 
KNOW HU A MOMENT WHEN YOU STARTED 
TO GET UPSET ABOUT HOW YOU DEALT 
WITH YOUR OWN FAMILY 
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE YOU ARE LIVING 
WITH HAD SO LITTLE MONEY AND YET 
THEY WERE SO DIGNIFIED AND SO NICE 
TO YOU AND WELCOMING YOU INTO THEIR 
HOME HOW DIFFICULT DO YOU THINK 
YOU ARE AS A PERSON HAVING SEEN 
WHAT THEY ARE LIKE LIVING WITH 
THEIR CONDITIONS 
I AM SO DIFFERENT TO WHAT I WAS 
BEFORE MY FAMILY NOW MEAN MORE TO 
ME THAN ANYTHING WHICH IS I AM 
SURE WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS ON THE 
SHOW I HAVE ALWAYS HAD QUITE A 
TOUGH RELATIONSHIP WITH MY FAMILY 
BUT I THINK IT WAS ALL BECAUSE I ME 
I WAS QUITE SELFISH L. DIDN'T 
REALLY RESPECT MY FAMILY L. THINK 
LIVING WITH THE FAMILIES OVER THERE 
TAUGHT ME THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT AT 
ALL BUT YET THEY STILL LOVE THEIR 
FAMILIES MORE THAN ANYTHING AND 
THEY COME FIRST WHICH HAS TAUGHT 
ME HOW MUCH I REALLY LOVE MY 
PARENTS 
SO A BIG LEARNING PARENTS EXPERIENCE FOR ALL OF YOU GEORGINA GEORGINA GREW SO MUCH EMOTIONALLY 
WE WERE TALKING YESTERDAY ABOUT THE 
CHANGES IN EACH OTHER L. AM SO MUCH 
MORE SURE OF MYSELF NOW 
YOU CAN 
TELL 
EVEN CHANGED HER HAIR COLOUR TELL I HAVE 
IT'S A FASCINATING PROGRAMME IT'S 
BLOOD WEIGHT AND T. BLOOD SWEAT 
AND T. SHIRTS THE LONDON'S TOP JOB 
HAS THE CHANCE TO CHANGE THE LIVES 
OF SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IF YOU 
LIVE OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL WHY WOULD 
YOU CARE JULIA GEORGE CAN TELL US 
THE LEADING CANDIDATES ARE SO 
FAMOUS THEY ARE BEING REFERRED TO 
BY THEIR FIRST NAMES THEY ARE 
OUTSPOKEN THEY ARE OFTEN 
OUTRAGEOUS BUT THEY ARE AT LEAST 
CAMPAIGNING ON ISSUES THAT 
GENUINELY AFFECT THE DAY TO DAY 
LIVES OF THEIR ELECTORATE THIS IS 
AN EXCITING RACE IT'S AN ELECTION 
FOR ANYONE WHO MOANED THAT POLITICS 
IS BORING 
IT HAS THE MAKINGS OF A GREAT SHOW 
THE BACKDROPS ARE STUNNING THE 
CHARACTERS LARGER THAN LIFE IN 
LONDON'S LATEST POWER STRUGGLE 
THESE ARE THE THREE MAIN PLAYERS 
IT'S A RACE TO RUN A WORLD CLASS 
CITY BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS SUCH A 
PRESTIGIOUS JOB THE MAYOR HAS 
ACQUIRED NEW POWERS OVER THE LAST 
FEW YEARS IT'S NOW A MAJOR JOB IN 
CITY POLITICS INDEED IT'S 
COMPARABLE WITH SOME OF THE BIG 
MAYORSHIPS ACROSS THE WORLD WE ARE 
TALKING NEW YORK PARIS ON 
FIRST 
LONDON VERSE A BIG JOB INDEED WHAT 
IF YOU DON'T LIVE OR WORK IN 
LONDON DO THE POLITICAL FORTUNES 
OF THIS CITY STILL MATTER THERE 
ARE ISSUES AT STAKE THAT AFFECT THE 
WHOLE COUNTRY NOT LEAST THE 
ECONOMY LONDON IS A FINANCIAL 
POWERHOUSE IT GENERATES ONE FIFTH 
OF OUR ANNUAL WEALTH THE MAYOR HAS 
A YEARLY BUDGET OF NINE BILLION IF 
LONDON TALKS MONEY TALK LONDON 
WILL BE HEARD A WORLD CITY MUST 
ALSO THRIVE IN THE GLARE OF 
INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY IN FOUR

BRITAIN THAT BOUNCES AROUND THE 
PLANET FOUR BILLION PEOPLE WILL 
WATCH THE LONDON GAMES ON T. V. THAT 
IS TWO THIRDS OF THE WORLD'S 
POPULATION NO PRESSURE THEN 
DESPITE THE HUGE RESPONSIBILITIES 
FOR THE NEXT LONDON MAYOR WHAT 
EVERYONE IS REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS 
THE CHARACTERS 
BORIS AND KEN ARE 
LIKE AN OLD COMEDY DUE YOE WHO 
HATED EACH OTHER IN REAL LIFE BUT 
HAD TO PRETEND TO BE MATES ON STAGE 
BUT IT'S THE OTHER WAY THEY RATHER 
LIKE EACH OTHER YOU SEE THEM IN 
PRIVATE JOSHING AND THEY COME ON 
STAGE AND ARE SPITTING BRICKS AT 
EACH OTHER 
WHAT ABOUT BRIAN 
PADDICK 
YES HE COULD DECIDE THE PADDICK ELECTION VERY STIFF RATHER 
STRAIGHT STRAIGHT AFTER COLOURFUL RACE 
GLITTERING PRIZE THE RESULT IS 
STILL FAR FROM CERTAIN 
KEN LIVINGSTONE WAS BEHIND IN THE 
POLL BUT IT SEEM HIS CAMPAIGN IS 
GATHERING MOMENTUM THE POLL IN THE 
SUNDAY TIMES SUGGEST HE IS ONE 
POINT AHEAD OF BORIS JOHNSON THERE 
IS EVERYTHING STILL TO PLAY FOR 
KEN LIVINGSTONE COULD USE A FEW 
VOTE BECAUSE OF THE CONGESTION 
CHARGE AND PARTICULARLY THE 
EXTENSION TO IT BUT THERE ARE 
QUESTION MARKS OVER BORIS JOHNSON'S 
SERIOUSNESS A FINAL THOUGHT THIS 
WILL BE CLOSELY MONITORED IN 
WESTMINSTER IT WOULD BE BAD FOR 
THE LABOUR TO LOSE LONDON AND THE 
GOOD FOR THE CONSERVATIVES TO WIN 
IT YOU CAN GET MORE ON THE WEBSITE

CRICKET MAYBE ANOTHER SIX 
IF TRY OUTS ARE SUCCESSFUL IT COULD 
BACK STANDARD IN TWENTY TWENTY MATCHES AND 
ONE DAY INTERNATIONALS WHO IS THAT 
PORKY CHAP THAT WAS ME CAN I SHOW 
THE BALL TO CAMERA THREE THIS IS 
THE RESULT OF FIFTY OVERS OF BASHING

ITS COLOUR MAYBE NOT SO MUCH ON 
THE SEEM BUT THAT'S NOT A BAD 
FIRST OUTING THE M. C. C. HAVE OTHER 
TESTS TO GO AND THEY RECKON THAT 
THAT COULD BE A BETTER SIDE BECAUSE 
THE WHITE BALLS GET MUCKY 
DID YOU HAVE GOOD TIME 
I HAD A 
TERRIFIC TIME L. STRUGGLED A BIT 
WITH THE BAT L. WAS RUSTY AND THE 
BOWLERS BOWLED IT VERY VERY VERY 
QUICKLY AT LORDS YESTERDAY SOME 
WOULD SAY THE PINK BALL NEEDS TO BE 
BIGGER AND THEY NEED TO BOWL IT A 
LOT LOT SLOWER THE CROWD PACKED 
LORDS YESTERDAY TO SEE US YOU YOU HIT ONE BOUNDARY 
WE PUT ON FORTY SEVEN FOR THE FIRST WICKET 
OF WHICH I CONTRIBUTED FIVE AND 
COUPLE OF LEG BIES 
YOU WERE CAUGHT BEHIND 
CAUGHT BEHIND BY THE WICKETKEEPER 
WHO HAD FANTASTIC GAME 
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE UP AND THE NEXT 
TEN YEARS YOU'RE DOWN 
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU 
WE COULD BE LOOKING AT PIPG BALLS 
IN THE PINK BALLS IN THE FUTURE 
NOW GOOD NEIGHBOURS BECOME GOOD 
FRIENDS THE SAYING GOES BUT 
THAT'S MORE LIKELY IN THE NORTH 
THAN IN THE SOUTH ACCORDING TO 
RESEARCH THAT SHOWS A DIVIDE IN OUR 
SOCIAL ATTITUDES 
IT FOUND NORTHERNERS ARE MORE 
LIKELY TO CHAT TO NEIGHBOURS AND 
MAKE VISITS TO SEE RELATIVES THAN 
THEIR SOUTHERN COUNTERPARTS FIONA 
TROTT WENT WENT TO SEE THE STREET 
VOTED THE FRIENDLY STREET IN 
BRITAIN A CUP OF TEA AND A 
NEIGHBOURLY CHAT IF YOU WANT TO 
KNOW WHAT MAKES A FRIENDLY 
COMMUNITY LOOK NO FURTHER THAN 
HERE HERE WELCOME TO SAINT IVES MOUNT IN LEEDS 
NEIGHBOURS WATER EACH OTHER'S 
PLANTS AND LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER'S 
PETS AND SOME OF THEM HOLIDAY 
TOGETHER NORTHERNERS ARE SAID TO 
BE MORE SOCIABLE THAN SOUTHERNERS 
WE HAVE HAD FOUR PARTIES CALLED JAM 
AT THE BACK PASSAGE AND BRINGS 
NEIGHBOURS FROM TWO STREETS THAT 
WAY AND TWO STREETS THIS WAY WHERE 
WE HAVE SINGING MUSIC FOOD DRINK 
LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T COME 
TOGETHER AND GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER 
BETTER WE HAVE HAD PEOPLE WHO 
HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER FOR 
YEARS BURY THE HATCHET AND GOOD 
FRIENDSHIPS HAVE BEEN FORMED 
SO HOW DO THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF 
ENGLAND COMPARE TODAY'S REPORT 
SAYS EIGHTY PER CENT OF NORTHERNERS SPEAK TO 
THEIR NEIGHBOURS REGULARLY 
COMPARED WITH SIXTY THREE PER CENT IN LONDON WHEN 
IT COMES TO FAMILIES THE FURTHER 
NORTH OF ENGLAND THE BETTER SIXTY TWO PER CENT 
IN THE NORTH EAST VISIT THEM WEEKLY 
COMPARED WITH THIRTY FIVE PER CENT IN LONDON 
THESE ALLIES ARE MORE CORONATION 
STREET THAN REGENT STREET BUT THE 
SOUTH COULD WHAT WHAT TAKE A LEAF 
OUT OF THEIR BOOK 
WE ARE ASKING WHY THERE IS A DIVIDE 
BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH WITH SUE 
CAROLL ALONG WITH STAUNCH 
SOUTHERNER OH YES YOU CAN SAY THAT 
AGAIN AND ARCHITECT MAXWELL 
HUTCHINSON HE ALWAYS MANSION TO 
UPSET A LOT OF PEOPLE 
SUE YOU LIVE IN PUTNEY DON'T YOU 
YOU LIVE IN FRIENDLY SOUTH LONDON 
IT IS IT IS FRIENDLY LONDON IS 
FULL OF LITTLE VILLAGES AND WHEN 
YOU ARE WITHIN THEM PEOPLE ARE 
FRIENDLY WITHIN THE VILLAGES IT IS 
JUST ON A BROADER SCALE I DON'T 
THINK LONDON IS FRIENDLY 
UP NORTH YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE IN 
YOUR ROAD YOUR STREET YOUR 
COMMUNITY YOUR CLUB BUT NOT 
NECESSARILY THE PEOPLE A FEW BLOCKS 
AWAY AWAY THE DAILY MIRROR CHOSE A ROAD 
CALLED PARK ROAD IN VARIOUS PARTS 
OF BRITAIN HULL PLYMOUTH 
NEWCASTLE WHEREVER 
IT WAS INTERESTING 
THE ONLY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WEREN'T 
FRIENDLY WERE IN LONDON THERE WAS 
NO SENSE OF COMMUNITY THIS IS 
BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THAT 
PARTICULAR STREET THEY THEY LIVED 
BEHIND HIGH HEDGES AND FENCES 
I THINK WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
UNFRIENDLINESS IN LONDON BECAUSE IN 
THE OTHER IN THE REST OF THE SOUTH 
YOU GO TO HAMPSHIRE CORNWALL 
DORSET SUSSEX 
PEOPLE ARE ARE INCREDIBLY FRIENDLY 
ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK LONDON 
LONDON ISN'T CONCEIVED AS FRIENDLY 
BECAUSE PEOPLE MOVE AND TURNOVER L. 
ALWAYS SPEAK TO MY NEXT DOOR 
NEIGHBOURS BUT THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO 
BE CHANGING AND MOVING THIS 
ITINERARY OF I TINE RANT MISSING 
PEOPLE MOVING ALL THE TIME 
COME OFF IT SUE YOU ARE FROM THE 
NORTH EAST AND PEOPLE IN NEWCASTLE 
ARE DELIGHTFUL ACTUALLY 
I WENT THERE FOR THE GREAT NORTH 
RUN AND I WENT SHOPPING AND IT WAS 
LIKE BEING IN A TEA PARTY PEOPLE 
WOULD COME UP AND SAY HELLO BILL 
HOW ARE YOU ARE YOU 
I LIVED IN 
THE SOUTH FOR A LONG TIME AND THERE 
ARE BITS OF ME THINK IT IS A MYTH 
AND THE MINUTE YOU GET OFF THE 
TRAIN IN NEWCASTLE THE TAXI DRIVER 
IS FRIENDLY AND YOU STAND AT A BUS 
STOP AND PEOPLE TALK TO YOU 
MIND YOU THAT'S BECAUSE IT TAKES 
HALF AN HOUR FOR A BUS TO COME 
ALONG ALONG IT SOUNDS GHASTLY THOUGH YOU DON'T 
HAVE ANY PRIVACY AT ALL YOU CAN'T 
KEEP YOURSELF TO YOURSELF 
IT IS NOT BEING NOSY NECESSARILY 
IT IS JUST WANT TO GO TALK 
IT IS ASSOCIATION 
CLOST CLOST TRO PHOBIC GATHERING OF 
PEOPLE PEOPLE IT IS SHARING OPINIONS AND 
EXPRESSING VIEWS IT IS WANTING TO 
RELATE TO PEOPLE AND HAVING THEM 
RELATE TO YOU 
IF YOU WANT TO BE BE FRIENDLY TO 
PEOPLE I RECOMMEND YOU WEAR HAT 
PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AND SAY WHAT 
A WONDERFUL HAT IF YOU WANT 
PEOPLE TO BE FRIENDLY TO YOU IN 
PLACES THAT ARE BETTER RECEIVED AS 
UNFRIENDLY I WOULD RECOMMEND HAT 
IN NEWCASTLE THEY WOULD THINK YOU 
ARE BONKERS L. WILL BUY YOU A FLAT CAP CAP THEY WOULDN'T FRIENDLY THOUGH 
WOULDN'T THEY 
THEY WOULD BE 
CURIOUS CURIOUS THEY WOULD SAY WHERE DID YOU GET 
THAT HAT 
I KNOW IN WALES AND IN 
LIVERPOOL AND LEEDS AND SOME PLACES 
WHERE I LIVED WHERE PEOPLE PULL 
TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST 
WHAT WHAT USED TO HOLD THEM 
TOGETHER AND THEY HAVE GOT TO FIND 
SOMETHING ELSE AND IT IS ALMOST AS 
IF THE COMMUNITY TURNS IN ON ITSELF 
TO PROTECT ITSELF 
YOU GET THAT IN THE EAST END OF 
LONDON BECAUSE OF HUGE LOSS IN 
THE EAST END OF LONDON YOU HAVEN'T 
GOT THE SAME MIGRATION OF PEOPLE 
INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THEY 
TEND TO BE THE SAME SORTS OF 
COMMUNITIES AND SAME FAMILIES THAT 
HAVE BEEN THERE FOR GENERATIONS 
PEOPLE FROM THE NORTH OR AS THE 
SCOTS WOULD HAVE IT FROM THE SOUTH 
THEY CARE MORE ABOUT THEIR 
FAMILIES 
THEY LIVE CLOSER TO THEIR FAMILIES FAMILIES YOU HAVE GOT TO REMEMBER 
IT IS EASIER TO TRAVEL AROUND JUST 
IN THE NORTH EAST FOR EXAMPLE IT 
IS EASIER TO GET FROM A TO B. THAN 
IF YOU LIVE IN LONDON IF YOU ARE 
TRAVELLING ACROSS LONDON TO SEE A 
RELATIVE IT CAN TAKE A LONG TIME 
THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES 
PART OF THE SURVEY ALSO CLAIMED 
THAT THIS CLOSENESS CAN MAKE PEOPLE 
INWARD LOOKING AND NOT REALLY 
MOBILE ENOUGH THEY RELY TOO MUCH 
ON THEIR FAMILIES 
IS THERE SOME MYSTERIOUS LINE ABOVE 
WHICH PEOPLE ARE FRIENDLY AND BELOW 
WHICH THEY ARE NOT SOME ARE SAYING 
THAT LEEDS ISN'T REALLY NORTH 
WHERE IS THIS PLACE CALLED NORTH IF 
IT IS NOT LEEDS 
YOU KNOW IT IS SOUTH OF WATFORD 
ARE YOU SAYING THAT NOTTINGHAM IS 
UP NORTH 
I WOULD DESCRIBE 
NOTTINGHAM AS NORTH 
WOULD YOU 
YES I WOULD 
HAVING BEEN TO MANCHESTER REGULARLY 
RECENTLY I FIND THE PEOPLE THERE 
UNFRIENDLY UNFRIENDLY OH OH I WAS WONDERING WHICH CITY YOU 
WOULD INSULT 
YOU GOT THROUGH THE WHOLE INTERVIEW 
WITHOUT INSULTING ANYONE FROM THE 
PROCURATOR FISCALENSS PRCHBSS 
BUT YOU PROVINCES BUT YOU FAILED 
AGAIN AGAIN PEOPLE OF MANCHESTER WRITE TO 
MAXWELL GO UP TO MANCHESTER WITH 
THE HIT 
THEY WILL LOVE IT 
OXFORD ROAD THEY WILL BE THERE 
AH DEARY ME 
THE SUN IS BOUND TO BE SHINING IN 
MANCHESTER IT ALWAYS DOES DOESN'T 
IT MATT 
IT MATT 
IT MATT ONE THING THAT BRINGS YOU TOGETHER 
IS THE STATE OF THE WEATHER AND IT 
IS NOT LOOKING BAD 
A REAL HINT OF SPRING ACROSS THE 
MAJORITY OF THE U. K. WITH FAIR 
AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE AROUND AND MUCH 
OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD STAY DRY 
THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT IT WON'T BE CLEAR BLUE SKIES ALL 
THE WAY THROUGH TODAY AT THE 
MOMENT FROM THE SATELLITE PICTURE 
WE HAVE FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUD 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY MOST OF THAT IS 
HIGH BASED 
JUST WEAKENING THE SUNSHINE TOUCH 
UNDER IT WE HAVE AREAS OF LOW 
CLOUD CLOUD HERE AT THE MOMENT GREY AND MISTY 
BUT THAT LOW CLOUD WILL THIN AND 
BREAK AND JOIN IN WITH THE REST OF 
THE COUNTRY WITH BRIGHT AND SUNNY 
SPELLS SPELLS SIMILAR CONDITIONS ACROSS SCOTLAND 
STILL A BIT OF CLOUD TOWARDS THE 
EAST AND STILL WITH THE WIND COMING 
OFF THE NORTH SEA WE WILL FEEL A 
CHILL IN THE AIR AS WILL BE THE THE 
CASE ACROSS THE NORTH SEA COASTS 
ANYWHERE FROM THE NORTH WEST DOWN 
TOWARDS THE MIDLANDS IN TWADS THE 
SOUTH EAST WILL BE A FINE 
AFTERNOON IN THE SUNSHINE IT WILL 
FEEL WARMER THAN OF LATE 
TEMPERATURES PEAKING AT SEVENTEEN CELSIUS 
OR EIGHTEEN CELSIUS 
A SEA BREEZE DEVELOP TOWARDS THE 
SOUTH COAST AND ACROSS DEVON AND 
CORNWALL LATER ON AFTER A FINE 
SUNNY DAY WE WILL START TO SEE MORE 
CLOUD DEVELOP AS WILL BE THE CASE 
ACROSS THE WESTERN WESTERN FRINGES 
OF WALES AND THE WESTERN HALF OF 
NORTHERN IRELAND THE CLOUD OUT 
TOWARDS THE WEST IS AHEAD OF A BANK 
OF RAIN IT WON'T STAY DRY FOR TOO 
LONG THE RAIN PUSHING IN ACROSS 
MANY PARTS TONIGHT A NARROW BAND 
OF RAIN BUT THERE WILL BE THE ODD 
HEAVIER BURST AS IT PUSHES TO ALL 
BUT EASTERN SCOTLAND AND EASTERN 
ENGLAND ENGLAND AS THE WINDS WILL GO TO A SOUTH 
WESTERLY DIRECTION IT WILL START 
TO TURN MILDER 
A A BIT OF MIG AROUND FIRST THING 
A WET START THROUGH PARTS OF 
SCOTLAND NORTHERN ENGLAND 
MIDLANDS AND THE SOUTH EAST BUT 
THAT RAIN WILL CLEAR ALL BUT THE 
FAR EAST OF THE COUNTRY WITH MOST 
PLACES BRIGHTENING UP INTO THE 
AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES WILL CLIMB 
INTO THE MID OR HIGH BETWEENS 
HIGH TEENS 
THAT'S IT 
WE HAVE AN UPDATE ON THOR NOW 
WHERE IS HE 
ABOUT A MILE AWAY 
UNFORTUNATELY HE'S NOT FLYING OR 
HE WOULD BE HERE SO THOR THE 
EAGLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BIRDS 
OF PREY IS GOING TO BE HERE AFTER 
NINE A M. WE HOPE 
IF YOU SAY THE WORDS NANCY DELALIO 
DELL'OLIO YOU WILL THINK OF 
GLAMOROUS AND MANY OTHER THINGS 
AND UNTIL NOW NANCY YOU HAVE NOT 
TALKED MUCH AND NOW HERE YOU ARE 
I THINK SOMETIMES FACTS ARE MORE 
IMPORTANT THAN WORDS 
I HAVE BEEN 
TALKING DEFINITELY I LOVE TALK 
ING BY THE MEDIA TALK AND WRITING 
AND IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THE 
FASCINATION IN THE MEDIA ABOUT US 
AND ME WITH SVEN 
AND SO YOU'RE 
SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT IN YOUR 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
NO I'M NOT SETTING AUTOBIOGRAPHY THE RECORD STRAIGHT BECAUSE THERE 
IS NOTHING TO BE SAID 
AUTOBIOGRAPHYS ARE ALWAYS A NICE 
EXERCISE ESPECIALLY FOR MYSELF L. 
LIKED TO GIVE AN IDEA ABOUT ME AS A 
WOMAN AND WHO I AM THERE WAS 
NOTHING TO BE SAID BUT OF COURSE 
IT CAN IS MY WAY TO EXPRESS THINGS 
DEFINITELY 
YOU CALLED IT MY DEFINITELY BEAUTIFUL GAME 
DO YOU THINK IT'S A 
GOOD TITLE 
WELL THERE IS 
REFERENCE TO FOOTBALL 
YES OF 
COURSE I'M TALKING ABOUT MY 
BEAUTIFUL GAME THE BEAUTIFUL GAME 
OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A GAME 
BUT I TAKE A LOT OF COURSE WITH 
THE FASCINATION WITH FOOTBALL AND 
THAT IS CALLED THE BEAUTIFUL GAME 
AND LIFE IS A BEAUTIFUL GAME 
PEOPLE WERE INTERESTED IN YOUR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH SVEN AND YOU DO 
DEDICATE THE BOOK TO SVEN 
YES OF 
COURSE BUT THERE WAS NO REASON NOT 
TO DO IT BECAUSE HE SHARED AN 
IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE SO FAR 
THE FIRST PART OF MY JOURNEY SO FAR 
SO OF COURSE I'M VERY PLEASED TO 
DEDICATE IT TO HEM 
AND YOU TALK 
ABOUT HIM WITH A GREAT DEAL OF 
ADMIRATION AND RESPECT AS WELL 
I'VE READ IT AND YOU SAY YOU'RE 
USED TO MEN'S ADMIRING GLANCES BUT 
IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT THE FIRST 
TIME SVEN CAUGHT YOUR EYE WHAT DID 
YOU MEAN 
WELL I AM ALWAYS 
FASCINATED BY HOW ANY LOVE STORY 
STARTS AND THE FIRST TIME I TALK 
ABOUT IT IN THE BOOK IS IT STARTS 
QUIET AND INTENSE AND IT WAS A 
FANTASTIC MOMENT FOR ME BUT 
DIFFICULT BECAUSE I WAS LEAVING MY 
HUSBAND HUSBAND IF I THINK YOU MEAN THE PART WHEN 
WE REALISE THAT WE LIKE EACH OTHER 
SO IT IS THE BEGINNING OF A LOVE 
STORY IS ALWAYS FASCINATING YES 
APART FROM THAT AND THAT WAS A 
HUGE STORY BUT YOU HAVE HAD VERY 
BUSY LIFE DOING LOTS OF THINGS BUT 
YOU ARE BY PROFESSION LAWYER 
YES I AM A LAWYER 
DO YOU STILL 
HAVE TIME TO DO IT 
NOT REALLY 
STILL DO SOME CONSULTING BUT I AM 
BACK TO DO LOBBYING IN SOME 
PARTICULAR MATTERS BETWEEN 
COUNTRIES 
FOR INSTANCE 
MORE ON AN COUNTRIES INTERNATIONAL LEVEL IT IS FOR MY 
CAMPAIGN TO MOBILISE THE 
INTERNATIONAL FORCE OF FOOTBALL TO 
GET THIS RESPECT SO I'M WORKING 
WITH THE BRITISH ORGANISATIONS AND 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS TO 
LAUNCH MY CAMPAIGN SO THIS IS WHAT 
I DO MOST IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET 
TIME TO DO LAW BUT I DON'T MISS IT 
NOW 
AND YOU'VE MET THE PRIME NOW MINISTER 
I'VE MET HIM MORE THAN MINISTER TWICE 
WITH TRUCE THIS CAMPAIGN TO TWICE USE FOOTBALL TO BRING PEACE HOW 
DOES THAT WORK 
THIS WAS KOFI 
ANNAN BEFORE HE LEFT IN TWO THOUSAND TWO HE 
ESTABLISHED BECAUSE IT WAS ASKED 
BY THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT TO HAVE A 
DAY OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE TWENTY FIRST 
SEPTEMBER EVERY STATE MEMBERS 
SIGNED TO HAVE THIS INTERNATIONAL 
DAY THEN THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING 
TO MAKE IT TO CELEBRATE THE DATE 
BUT AFTER THAT EVERYBODY SEEMS TO 
HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT SO WHEN I 
WENT TO TALK TO KOFI ANNAN THERE 
WAS SOMETHING O. K. IT MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN BETTER THAN FOOTBALL BUT IT 
NEEDED SOMETHING TO MOBILISE IT TO 
BRING IT INTO EFFECT SO WE STARTED 
A CAMPAIGN WITH FOOTBALL AND IT WAS 
FIRST THAT WE KICKED THE BALL FROM 
ME TO SVEN TO KOFI ANNAN AND THEN 
IT WENT ALL AROUND THE WORLD AND 
THEN I GOT THE SUPPORT OF TONY 
BLAIR 
AND IN ITALY YOU'RE KNOWN BLAIR AFFECTIONLY AS THE DARK LADY IT IT IS NOT THE SAME IT IS VERY 
POSITIVE IT IS A LONG STORY AND 
ONLY USED BY ONE PAPER BUT 
COMPLEMENTARY BECAUSE I WAS 
MYSTERIOUS AND I USUALLY TENDED TO 
WEAR BLACK BUT THE FACT IS BECAUSE 
THERE WAS ANOTHER DAME CALLED WHITE 
BECAUSE SHE WAS WEARING WHITE WITH 
A SIMILAR STORY BECAUSE THEY 
DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHO I WAS THIS 
NEW WOMAN NEXT TO SVEN AND IT IS 
USED TO BRING LUCK AND THEY CALLED 
ME THAT 
CAN WE ASK YOU THE BOOK ONE 
DEDICATED TO SVEN AND THERE IS A 
LOT ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP AND THE 
HIGHS AND LOWS WHERE ARE YOU WITH 
HIM NOW STILL WITH HIM OR NOT 
ACCORDING TO THE PAPERS 
NEVER MIND 
THE PAPERS WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT 
YOU THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW OF OF COURSE I KNOW WE ARE HAVING A GOOD 
TIME APART SINCE MORE THAN EIGHT 
MONTHS THIS MEANS OF COURSE WE 
SEE EACH OTHER AND WE TALK YOU'RE YOU'RE FRIENDS 
DEFINITELY WE'RE FRIENDS FRIENDS AND WE'LL SEE HE IS IN MANCHESTER 
NOW AND I'M IN LONDON AND NOW IT 
IS NECESSARY TO HAVE THIS TIME 
APART APART YOU KNOW YOU'VE SOLVED ONE MYSTERY 
I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU SPEAK BEFORE 
REALLY 
NO LOTS OF PICTURES L. REALLY I HAVE BEEN ON THE TELEVISION LOTS OF 
TIMES 
YES BUT 
I MISSED IT L. CAN TIMES RECORD A TAPE 
ID A TAKE IT HOME 
WITH ME EYE 
I'D THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
MY PLEASURE 
YOU'RE ALL OF A FLUT 
ARE NOW L. AM 
FLUTTER 
NOW OUR NEXT GUEST IS ENTERING NEW 
TERRITORY FOR HIS LATEST FILM A 
COMEDY ABOUT THE LUND UNDERGROUND 
IT IS ABOUT A DRIVER WHO HITS TWO 
PEOPLE AND BELIEVES HE WOULD BE DUE 
FOR A BIG PAYOUT IF HE HIT A THIRD 
IT IS A CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT AND 
THERE WERE SOME PROTESTS AT THE 
PREMIERE LAST NIGHT 
NIGH LET'S LOOK AT THE FILM THERE 
MUST BE SOMETHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED 
TO DO AND NEVER GOT THE CHANCE 
THERE IS 
EXCELLENT WHAT IS IT 
WE'LL DO THAT 
I WANT TO SWIM WITH 
A GREAT WHITE SHARK NO CAGE JUST 
ME AND THE BEAST EYEBALL TO 
EYEBALL THERE'S A FELLER DOES IT 
SOUTH AFRICAN I TAU HIM ON THE 
TELLY HE JUST GETS RIGHT IN THERE 
WITH HEM HE'S NEVER BEEN BIT YET 
YES WELL THE THING IS WE'VE ONLY 
GOT THIS WEEKEND IT HAS TO MONDAY 
GIVE IT TO CHARITY ISN'T THERE 
SOMEBODY YOU KNOW WHO COULD USE 
SOME CASH WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY 
MY FAMILY THEY PROBABLY THINK I'M 
DEAD ALREADY 
THERE YOU GO IT 
WOULD BE FIVE NICE SURPRISE FOR THEM 
AND COLIN JOINS US NOW L. HELLO 
GOOD MORNING 
NICE TO SEE YOU IT 
DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A PARTICULARLY 
CONTROVERSIAL FILM BUT WE WERE 
SPEAKING TO A TUBE DRIVER THIS 
MORNING AND THERE WERE PROTESTS AT 
THE PREMIERE AND THEY DON'T LIKE 
IT BECAUSE IT ACCENTUATES A VERY 
ONE FIFTY I. O. U. S. PROBLEM WHICH IS PEOPLE 
THROWING THEMSELVES UNDER TUBE 
TRAINS 
WELL THERE WEREN'T EXACTLY TRAINS PROTESTS LAST NIGHT ASLEF VERY 
VERY CONSCIENTIOUSLY AND TASTEFULLY 
AND WELL WERE THERE TO HAND OUT 
LEAFLETS EXPLAINING THE KIND OF 
TRAUMA THAT DRIVERS GO THROUGH WHEN 
THEY EXPERIENCE AN ACCIDENT LIKE 
THIS AND WE WERE QUITE HAPPY WITH 
THAT AS ANYBODY WOULD BE NOBODY 
IS MORE AWARE OF THE TRAUMA THAT 
DRIVERS GO THROUGH THAN WE ARE 
HAVING GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF 
MAKING THIS FILM AND WE DON'T IN 
ANY WAY IN THE FILM TRIVIALISE OR 
MAKE FUN OF THIS AND THE SLIGHT 
KIND OF MISUNDERSTANDING HERE IS 
THAT THESE COMMENTS ARE BEING MADE 
BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THE 
FILM PERHAPS THERE WAS AN ERROR IN 
MARKETING SLIGHTLY THAT THE 
EMPHASIS WAS PUT ON THE COMEDY 
ASPECTS OF THIS FILM SO YOU SEE 
THE POSTER AND YOU THINK OH IT'S 
A COMEDY ABOUT PEOPLE WHO FALL 
UNDER TRAINS OF COURSE IT ISN'T A 
COMEDY ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO FALL 
UNDER TRAINS OR THE DRIVERS WHO 
DRIVE THOSE TRAINS THERE IS A 
GREAT DESCRIPTION OF DRAMAS WHICH 
HAS BEEN LOST A LITTLE BIT IN THE 
MODERN AGE WHICH IS A COMIC 
TRAGEDY IT WAS A DESCRIPTION OF 
ALL THE GREAT PLAYS BUT CHEKOV AND 
IBSEN AND OTHERS AND I THINK IT'S 
A VERY APT DESCRIPTION OF THE 
SCRIPT IT IS A VERY VERY FUNNY 
SITUATION ABOUT TWO GUYS WHO COME 
TOGETHER IN THE MOST UNLIKELY 
CIRCUMSTANCES AND FIND THEMSELVES 
IN THE MOST UNLIKELY CIRCUMSTANCES 
AND THROUGH THEIR EXPERIENCE THEY 
FORM A RELATIONSHIP AND YOU LEARN 
SO MUCH ABOUT LIFE AND EMOTIONS AND 
ABOUT TRUTH YOU KNOW WHAT LIVING 
MEANS THROUGH THIS AND THAT IS 
WHAT THE FILM IS ABOUT 
WHEN YOU SAW THE SCRIPT AND YOU 
WERE THINKING ABOUT DOING IT DID 
YOU HAVE QUESTIONS IN YOUR MIND 
DID YOU THINK OH GOSH THIS IS A 
BIT 
NOT AT ALL REALLY BIT REALLY ABSOLUTELY NOT IF ANYBODY SEES THE 
FILM WHEN I READ THE SCRIPT I 
LAUGHED OUT LOUD IT WAS A PAGE 
TURNER IT 
WAS WONDERFUL L. ALSO WAS VERY MOVED BY IT AND AS WE 
WENT WON LIKE THE FIRST TABLE 
READING HAVING A TEAR IN MY EYE 
ESPECIALLY WHEN IMELDA STAUNTON 
WHO PLAYS MY WIFE HER PERFORMANCE 
IS AMAZING THERE WERE SO MANY 
MOMENTS IN THIS FILM THAT MOVE YOU 
AND THEY'RE VERY VERY EMOTIONAL 
AND THEY'RE NOT ABOUT THE MOMENTS FOUR 
HE FALLS UNDER THE TRAIN OR 
ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT'S ABOUT 
OTHER THINGS MOMENTS WHEN HE 
FALSE UNDER THE TRAIN 
WE HAVE A CLIP FRANKIE 
NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE FRANKIE WHAT ALL I DID WAS SAY HELLO 
YOU CAN'T JUST TURN UP AFTER EIGHT 
YEARS AND EXPECT HER TO WELCOME YOU

CAST LIST I WAS THRILLED I'VE BEEN 
A FAN OF IMELDA FOR YEARS AND I WAS 
THRILLED TO GET A CLANS TO WORK

EWAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BYE BYE 
YOU CAN SEE DECEPTION IT IS AT 
CINEMAS FROM FRIDAY 
THOR IS HERE 
WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR AGES FOR 
THOR AND LOOK 
HE IS MAGNIFICENT YOU ARE A 
BEAUTIFUL BIRD 
HELLO PHIL YOU ARE RATHER LOVELY 
TOO TOO AND YOU HAVE BEEN CHATTING TO THOR 
AND KEEPING HIM COMPANY 
THAT'S AN ADULT BIRD 
HE IS HERE AND YOU'RE HERE AS PART 
OF A CAMPAIGN BY THE R. S. P. B. TO RAISE 
AWARENESS OF THE LARGE NUMBERS OF 
BIRDS OF PREY BEING KILLED 
ILLEGALLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO 
PROTECT THE GAME BIRD POPULATION SO 
THEY CAN BE SHOT FOR SPORT AND SUE 
ARMSTRONG BROWN IS HERE TOO 
IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY 
WOULD SET OUT TO KILL A BIRD LIKE 
THAT 
THOR LOOKS FANTASTIC AND IT THAT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THAT ANYBODY 
COULD HURT A BIRD LIKE THOR BUT 
GOLDEN EAGLES AND HARRIERS ARE 
BEING KILLED MOSTLY IN THE UPLANDS 
OF THE U. K. WHERE THEY ARE HUNTERS 
THEY LIVE BY HUNTING AND 
UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE THINGS 
THEY HUNT ARE IMPORTANT TO UPLAND 
BUSINESSES IF A BIRD LIKE THOR 
EATS A GROUSE IT BECOMES THE ENEMY 
OF SOME OF THE GROUSE MOOR OWNERS 
AND MANAGERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
THE BACK OF THOR 
HE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY BEAST TELL 
US MORE ABOUT HIM 
HE IS TWO YEARS OLD HE WAS BRED IN 
CAPTIVITY IN GERMANY FOR FALCONRY 
PURPOSES PURPOSES HE IS GREAT LAD HE IS VERY INQUISITIVE INQUISITIVE WHEN YOU SAY HE HAS BEEN BRED IN 
CAPTIVITY DOES THAT MEAN HE WILL 
ONLY EAT WHAT YOU FEED HIM SO HE 
WON'T GO FLYING OFF LOOKING FOR 
PREY 
IT WOULD BE WRONG FOR US TO PREY KEEP HIM IN AN AVIARY SO HE IS 
FLOWN HE IS USED FOR EDUCATIONAL 
PURPOSES BUT HE IS USED FOR 
HUNTING YOU HAVE GOT TO KEEP HIS 
NATURAL INSTINCTS AND IT IS ONLY 
THAT HE SHOULD DO SO HE DOES HUNT 
FROM OCTOBER THROUGH TO THE END OF 
FEBRUARY FEBRUARY BUT GROUND GAME WHICH IS HARES AND 
RABBITS NOT PHEASANTS AND 
PARTRIDGES AND THAT THING 
HOW DO YOU PERSUADE LANDOWNERS TO 
BE MORE FRIENDLY TO BIRDS OF PREY 
LI KE HEN HARRIERS AND EAGLES 
WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A PROJECT 
WITH LANDOWNERS AND GROUSE MOOR 
MANAGERS TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS IT 
IS A PROBLEM IF A BIRD OF PREY 
TAKES A HARVEST FROM A FARM THEY 
HAVE BUSINESS PROBLEM IT IS 
ILLEGAL TO KILL THE BIRDS OF PREY 
BUT WE KNOW IT GOES ON WE ARE 
WRITING TO TWO HUNDRED GROUSE MOOR BONERS 
AND MANAGERS IN THE OWNERS AND 
MANAGERS IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
HOW MANY ARE THERE 
THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY 
GOLDEN EAGLE BUT THEY OUGHT TO BE 
IN THE BOARD BORDERS OF SCOTLAND 
AND OUGHT TO BE COMMON IN WALES 
THERE ARE LOADS OF HABITAT WHICH 
THE BIRDS CAN LIVE HEN HARRIERS 
THERE ARE FIFTEEN PAIRS OF HEN HARRIERS 
NESTED IN ENGLAND THREE ARE ON 
GROUSE MOORS THERE SHOULD BE TWO HUNDRED 
THERE IS LOADS OF HABITATS AND IN 
THE LOW LANDS WE SAW BUZZARDS WHICH 
WERE RESTRICTED AND SO WERE 
SPARROWHAWKS AND RED KITES BECAUSE 
WE HAVE HAD LANDOWNERS WORKING 
WORKING TOGETHER IF YOU DRIVE UP 
THE M. FORTY YOU MIGHT SEE A RED KITE 
THEY HAVE COME BACK BECAUSE 
LANDOWNERS LANDOWNERS WANTED TO SEE 
THEM RECOVER THAT'S WHAT WE WANT 
TO SEE IN THE UPLANDS WE ARE 
ASKING FOR WE SHOULD HAVE TWO HUNDRED HEN 
HARRIERS IN ENGLAND WE ARE ASKING 
FOR FORTY FORTY HEN HARRIERS BY TWO THOUSAND TEN ON 
GROUSE MOORS THAT WOULD BE 
FANTASTIC FANTASTIC IF YOU CAN TRY AND GO TO SEE AS
