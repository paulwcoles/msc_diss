BODY OF A MOTHER WHO WENT MISSING 
LAST FRIDAY HAS BEEN FOUND BUT HER 
SEVERELY DISABLED SON IS STILL 
MISSING 
JAMES IS STILL UNACCOUNTED MISSING FOR AND IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY 
THAT WE ARE CONCERNED FOR HIS WELL 
BEING HE HAS THE MENTAL AGE OF AN 
EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD CHILD AND OTHER 
PROBLEMS INCLUDING EPILEPSY THE THE CLINTON V. OBAMA SLUGFEST HOW THE 
BATTLE FOR AMERICA'S PRESIDENCY IS 
TURNING NASTY AND IS THIS REALLY A 
CRIME THE FATHER OF FOUR WITH A 
CRIMINAL RECORD FOR OVERFILLING HIS 
BIN 
TONIGHT ON B. B. C. LONDON THE 
POLITICAL ELITE JOINS THE FAMILY OF 
STEPHEN LAWRENCE FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE 
TEENAGER'S MURDER AND ACCUSED OF 
BREAKING ELECTION BROADCAST RULES 
A T. V. SATELLITE COMPANY IS UNDER 
INVESTIGATION 
GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE B. B. C. 
NEWS AT SIX ANYONE HOPING FOR A 
QUICK FIX TO THE COUNTRY'S MORTGAGE 
CRISIS IS GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED 
A DOWNING STREET MEETING BETWEEN 
THE CHANCELLOR ALASTAIR DARLING 
AND BRITAIN'S BIGGEST MORTGAGE 
LENDERS HAS ENDED WITH NO PROMISES 
OF HELP FOR HARD PRESSED BORROWERS 
DESPITE THE FIFTY BILLION PUMPED INTO 
MONEY MARKETS YESTERDAY THE 
PROBLEMS FACED BY HIGH STREET 
LENDERS IS FAR FROM OVER AS HUGH 
PYM REPORTS IT IS A FOR MANY 
MOVING INTO A NEW HOME BUT THAT 
DREAM HAS BEEN SHATTERED FOR MANY 
NEW BORROWERS BECAUSE THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH HAS MADE IT HARDER TO GET A 
MORTGAGE SO HOW CAN WE GET MORE 
MORTGAGES THAT WAS ON THE AGENDA 
AT A DOWNING STREET MEETING BETWEEN 
THE CHANCELLOR AND THE MORTGAGE 
LENDERS THEY WERE UNDER PRESSURE 
TO HELP BORROWERS BYPASSING ON 
INTEREST RATE CUTS YESTERDAY THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND ANNOUNCED A FIFTY 
BILLION INJECTION OF FUNDS TO KICK 
START THE MARKETS HERE AT THE 
TREASURY THEY THOP MEASURES TO GET 
BANKS LENDING TO EACH OTHER AGAIN 
WILL IN DUE COURSE PRODUCE BENEFITS 
FOR MORTGAGES WHICH ARE CHEAPER AND 
EASIER TO GET BUT HERE AT THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND THERE IS A DIFFERENT 
EMPHASIS THEY ARE SAYING IT IS 
NOTHING TO DO WITH BAILING TOUT 
HOUSING MARKET THE MEASURE ARE TO 
UNDERPIN THE BANKING SYSTEM AND 
AVOID ANOTHER NORTHERN ROCK STYLE 
FAILURE HOME REPOSSESSIONS HAVE 
GONE UP AND THERE ARE FEARS OF 
ANOTHER RISE PROPERTY AUCTIONS ARE 
SEEING A BIG INCREASE IN HOUSES AND 
FLATS UP FOR SALE BECAUSE THE 
OWNERS CAN'T AFFORD THEIR MORTGAGES 
MINISTERS 
PR 
LENDERS TO PLAY 
FAIR WITH CUSTOMERS WHO ARE 
STRUGGLING 
IF YOU HAVE A STRUGGLING POSSESSION YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SALE 
WHICH IS FORCED YOU CIT TALLISE A 
LOSS THAT IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF 
THE CUSTOMERS OR THE LENDERS 
EVERYONE IS LOOKING TO KEEP PEOPLE 
IN THEIR HOMES THERE IS A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO ENGAGE WITHURE 
LEND TORE HELP YOURSELF LEADING LEADING BANKS AROUND THE WORLD ARE IN 
TROUBLE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND IS 
SHAKING THE BUCKET ASKING SHARE 
HOLDERS FOR TWELVE BILLION AFTER 
LOSSES IN THE U. S. MORTGAGE MARKET 
OTHER BANKS WILL FOLLOW SUIT 
EXPERTS SAY CUSTOMERS SHOULD NOT 
EXPECT THINGS TO GET EASIER SOON 
WHEN THE CREDIT CRUNCH IS OVER FOR 
THE BANKS I. E. THEY CAN RAISE ENOUGH 
FUNDS TO CONTINUE THEIR BUSINESSES 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH WON'T NECESSARILY 
BE OVER FOR THE CONSUMERS BECAUSE 
THEY WILL STILL BE FACING HIGHER 
MORTGAGE RATES BECAUSE THE BANKS 
WILL TRY AND REBUILD THEIR PROFITS 
AND FOR ALL THE DOWNING STREET 
MEETINGS AND MEASURES BORROWING 
FOR HOME BUYERS HAS NOT GOT EASIER 
YET OUR BUSINESS EDITOR IS WITH ME 
IT IS CLEAR A THE CHANCELLOR WANTS 
HE WANTS HELP FOR BORROWERS WILL 
HE GET IT 
HE GOT SOME OF WHAT HE 
WANTED THERE WERE NIGHT WARM WORDS 
FROM THE BANKERS THEY WON'T THROW 
PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOMES BUT ON 
THE BIG THING THE CHANCELLOR WOULD 
LIKE WHICH IS MORTGAGE RATES 
FALLING IN LINE WITH THE CUT WE 
HAVE SEEN THE ANSWER THERE FROM 
THE BANKERS WAS NOT MUSIC TO HIS 
EARS THEY BLAMING CONDITIONS IN 
THE MARKETS SAYING THE COST IS 
STILL TIGHT FOR THEM AND THAT IS 
WHY PEOPLE CAN'T EXPECT TO SEE 
THEY SAID THAT IS WHY PEOPLE CAN'T 
SEE CHEAP MORTGAGE DEALS IN THE 
SHORT TERM BUT THEY SAYING 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO ME IN 
PRIVATE WHICH IS ACTUALLY IT IS 
NOT ABOUT TIGHT CONDITIONS THEY 
DELIBERATELY REBUILDING THEIR 
PROFITS WAS A THEY BECAUSE 
THEY THINK THEY LENT TOO MUCH TOO 
CHEAPLY LAST YEAR THEY BARELY MADE 
ANY BOFT F. R. PROFITS FROM THE DEALS 
THEY DID THEY WANT TO REBUILD 
THEIR PROFIT MARGINS T. GOVERNOR OF 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND THINKS THAT IS 
THE RIGHT THING TO DO SO BOTH FOR 
THE CHANCELLOR AND FOR BOAR BOWERS 
THE OUTLOOK IS NOT BORROWERS 
THE OUTLOOK IS NOT GREAT 
WELL THE 
CHANCELLOR HAS ANOTHER BATTLE ON 
HIS HANDS IT'S THE ONE WITH HIS 
OWN PARTY'S M. P.'S OVER THE ABOLITION 
OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE MORE THAN FIVE 
MILLION PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES WILL 
LOSE OUT AS A RESULT MR. DARLING 
HAS BEEN TRYING FIND A COMPROMISE 
WITH LABOUR REBELS JAMES LANDALE 
IS AT WESTMINSTER HE IS LOOKING 
FOR A COMPROMISE WHAT HAS HE TOLD 
M. P.'S 
HE HAS MOVED A NOTCH TODAY M. P.'S YESTERDAY LABOUR M. P.'S WERE OFFERED A 
REVIEW ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE 
CHANGE AND WHO WOULD LOSE AND WHAT 
THE GOVERNMENT MAY DO TO HELP THEM 
TODAY THE CHANCELLOR MADE CLEAR 
THAT WHATEVER HE DOES DECIDE TO DO 
IT WILL THE ACTION WILL TAKE 
PLACE WITHIN THIS FINANCIAL YEAR 
LABOUR M. P.'S ARE TAKING COMFORT FROM 
THAT FIRST BECAUSE THEY SAY THIS 
MEANS THE ISSUE WON'T BE KICKED 
INTO THE LONG GRASS THEY ARE 
MAKING THE INFERENCE THIS MEANS THE 
TREASURY WILL CONSIDER SOME FORM OF 
BACK DATED COMPENSATION WHICH THEY 
THINK IS IMPORTANT THE OTHER THING 
THAT HAPPENED TODAY THIS A THE 
TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE OFFERED A 
LIFELINE TO LABOUR M. P.'S WHO ARE 
WORRY ABOUT REBELLING THEY SAY THEY 
WILL REPORT BEFORE THE BILL LEAVES 
THE COMMONS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO 
VOTE ON IT NEXT WEEK BOTH SIDES 
ARE INCHING TOGETHER

THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THERE WERE NO 
EXCUSES FOR VIOLENT BEHAVIOUR MY MY CHILDREN ARE THE SAME AS THESE 
CHILDREN THEY DON'T DO THIS TO 
PEOPLE THEY DON'T DRINK IT HAS 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT IT HAS TO 
DO WITH THE FACT OF GOING OUT 
GLAMORISING GETTING DRUNK AND DOING 
THESE ACTS AND GETTING YOUR PHONE 
AND PICKING TAKING PICTURES 
THIS IS ABOVE THE POUNDRYS 
BOUNDARIES THE TRIAL OF MEN 
ACCUSED OF TRYING TO BLACK MAIL A 
MEMBER OF THE ROYAL FAMILY HAS BEEN 
HEARING EVIDENCE IN CLOSED SESSION

IN COURT L. GA

THEY ARE MADE BY WITNESS D. THAT IS 
THE EMPLOILEE OF THE WITNESS A THAT

PLOT WU LAUNCHED YOU CAN HEAR 
WITNESS D. MAKING SORDID UNSAVERY 
COMMENTS ABOUT MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL 
FAMILY AND THE ALLEGATION THAT 
WITNESS A PERFORMED A SEX ACT ON 
HIM THESE TAPES WERE PLAYED IN 
CLOSED SESSION TO THE COURT A 
SMALL NUMBER OF JOURNALISTS WERE 
ALLOWED IN COURT THE COURT HEARD 
FROM A DBLGT INSPECTOR THEY WERE 
BROUGHT IN TO SET UP THE STING 
OPERATION WR THE DEFENDANT WERE 
MET BY AN UNDERCOVER POLICEMAN THE 
DEFENCE SUGGESTED AT NO POINT DID 
THE DEFENDANTS UTTER A DEMAND FOR 
FIFTY THOUSAND THE INSPECTOR SAID THE 
DEMAND WAS IMPLICIT THE CASE 
CONTINUES 
THE B. B. C. HAS LEARNED THAT CONTINUES HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN TROOPS ARE 
FIGHTING IN BASRA ALONGSIDE THE 
IRAQI ARMY BASRA WAS UNDER BRITISH 
CONTROL UNTIL DECEMBER AND FOUR THOUSAND 
BRITISH TROOPS ARE STATIONED 
OUTSIDE THE CITY IT IS UNDERSTOOD 
THAT THEY ARE OFFERING SUPPORT TO 
THE OPERATION AMERICANS UNDER 
ATTACK IN IRAQ THERE IS NOTHING 
UNUSUAL IN THAT BUT THIS IS BASRA 
THE PLACE WHERE BRITISH TROOPS ARE 
BASED THESE FIGHTERS ARE THE 
REASON WHY THE AMERICANS ARE IN THE 
CITY FOR WEEKS THE IRAQI SECURITY 
FORCES HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DEFEAT 
THE SHI'ITE MILITIAMAN BUT NOW 
BRITAIN AND AMERICA HAVE STEPPED IN 
THE B. B. C. HAS LEARNED AS MANY AS ONE 
THOUSAND U. S. TROOPS HAVE BEEN SENT 
TO BASRA OUTSIDE THE CITY AT THE 
AIRPORT ARE FOUR THOUSAND BRITISH 
TROOPS THEY HAVE AN OVERWATCH 
CAPACITY IN PRACTICE THAT MEANS 
TRAINING IRAQI SOLDIERS BUT A 
WESTERN SOURCE TELLS IT INCLUDES 
MENTORING BY SPECIAL FORCES ON THE 
GROUND ELITE BRITISH AND AMERICAN 
TROOPS ARE OPERATING IN BASRA AN 
ACCEPTANCE PERHAPS THAT THE IRAQI 
FORCES ARE NOT UP TO THE JOB THERE 
ARE MORE THAN HALF A MILLION 
MEMBERS OF THE IRAQI SECURITY 
FORCES AND THEY ARE CRITICAL TO 
AMERICAN POLICY IN THIS COUNTRY 
THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO HAND 
OVER SECURITY CONTROL TO THEM BUT 
AS A LEADING GENERAL SAID THEY ARE 
NOT YET READY TO DEFEND IRAQ MANY 
HAVE DESERTED SOMETIMES TO 
CLERYIBS LOYAL TO THE MILITIA THEY 
ARE MEANT TO BE FIGHTING CLERICS 
OTHERS JUST WENT HOME LIKE THIS 
MAN WHO DOES NOT WANT TO SHOW HIS 
FACE 
I DON'T WANT TO FACE FIGHT IRAQIS OR MUSLIMS HOW CAN 
SOMEONE FIGHT HIS BROTHER OR 
COUSIN HOW CAN I KILL HIM BASRA BASRA IS REPORTED TO BE QUIETER BUT FOR 
THAT TO LAST IT IS LIKELY THAT 
BRITISH AND AMERICAN BOOTS WILL 
HAVE TO SOMEDAY ON THE GROUND 
STAY ON THE GRUND THE MOD MD HAS 
NAMED THE SOLDIER KILLED IN 
AFGHANISTAN YESTERDAY HE WAS 
ROBERT PEARSON OF THE QUEEN'S ROYAL 
LANCERS HE WAS IN AN ARMOURED 
VEHICLE IN HELMAND WHEN IT HIT A 
MINE DEPARETH CORKHILL HAS A 
CRIMINAL RECORD HE HAS HURT ANYONE 
OR STOLEN ANYTHING BUT HE PUT TOO 
MUCH RUBBISH IN HIS WHEELIE BIN 
THE COUNCIL INSIST IT WAS RIGHT TO 
TAKE HIM TO COURT GARETH CORKHILL 
HAS A CRIMINAL RECORD AND THIS WAS 
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME HE HAD SO 
MUCH RUBBISH HE COULD NOT QUITE 
CLOSE THE LID THE COUNCIL TO BE 
THIS PHOTOGRAPH AND LATER ISSUED 
HIM WITH A FIXED PENALTY NOTICE HE 
REFUSED TO PAY IT ARGUE THE LID WU 
ONLY ABOUT FOUR INCHES OPEN BUT HE 
ENDED UP GOING TO COURT HE NOW 
FACES A TOTAL FINE OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
I WAS 
ANNOYED I WAS TOLD TO PUT RUBBISH 
IN MY BIN L. CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT 
FINED FOR PUTTING RUBBISH IN ME OWN 
BIN 
THE COUNCIL SAY THE FAMILY HAD BIN BEEN ISSUED WITH WARNINGS AND HAD 
ALREADY BEEN GIVEN AN EXTRA LARGE 
BIN BUT THEY SAY THEY DID NOTHING 
WRONG 
I IT DISGUSTING I CAN'T WRONG BELIEVE THAT IT'S A CRIMINAL 
OFFENCE I CAN'T BELIEVE IT IN THE 
FUTURE IT CAN CAUSE US PROBLEMS FOR 
DOING WHAT YOU SUPPOSED TO DO AND 
PUT YOUR RUBBISH YOUR BIN 
OVER TO 
MAN FROM THE COUNCIL WAS THIS NOT 
AN OVERREACTION BEAR IN MIND THE 
PREVIOUS HISTORY AND HOW WE WORKED 
WITH THE FAMILY TO HELP THEM BUT BUT THEY OFFENDED AND SADLY IT CAME TO 
THIS 
WHAT IS POLICY HERE IS THAT THIS OKAY AS LONG AS IT IS NEARLY 
CLOSED 
THE LINE WE TAKE WITH OUR CLOSED RESIDENTS IS BIN LID CLOSED SO 
CLOSED MEANS CLOSED 
NOT EVEN THAT 
CLOSED MEANS CLOSED 
CRITICS ACCUSE 
THE GOVERNMENT OF INTRODUCING MORE 
THAN THREE THOUSAND NEW OFFENCES IN THE PAST 
TEN YEARS THE POTENTIAL COST OF 
LEAVING YOUR BIN LID OPEN MAY BE A 
SURPRISE TO SOME BUT AT LEAST NOW 
YOU HAVE BIN WARNED 
OUR TOP STORY THERE IS NO PROMISE 
OF AN EARLY CUT IN MORTGAGE RATES 
AFTER BANKERS MEET THE CHANCELLOR 
AND COMING UP THE NEW CHANCE TO 
MARRY IN THE CHURCH OF YOUR CHOICE 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON 
MY QUESTION IS 
WHAT WOULD THEY BE 
THE QUESTIONS 
YOU YOU POSTED ON THE NET ARE ASKED 
BY KEN LIVINGSTONE PLUS WE ARE AT 
ANFIELD AHEAD OF CHELSEA'S 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE BATTLE WITH 
LIVERPOOL 
IT'S A MAKE OR BREAK MOMENT FOR 
HILLARY CLINTON IN HER CAMPAIGN TO 
BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES SHE NEEDS A DECISIVE WIN IN 
TODAY'S PRIMARY ELECTION IN 
PENNSYLVANIA OR SHE WILL FACE HUGE 
PRESSURE TO CONCEDE TO HER DEMOCRAT 
RIVAL BARACK OBAMA MATTHEW PRICE 
REPORTS REPORTS EARLY MORNING DRIVING INTO 
PENNSYLVANIA ON THE WAY IN TO 
AMERICA'S NEXT POLITICAL 
BATTLEFIELD BATTLEFIELD THIS IS THE CRADLE OF THIS 
COUNTRY'S DEMOCRACY THE BIRTHPLACE 
OF ITS POLITICAL SYSTEM TODAY 
THERE WAS A LITTLE LAST MINUTE 
CAMPAIGNING FROM HILLARY CLINTON 
ASKED WHAT SHE WOULD DO IF IRAN GOT 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND ATTACKED ISRAEL 
SHE WAS UNEQUIVOCAL 
WHATEVER STAGE 
OF DEVELOPMENT THEY MIGHT BE IN 
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME IN 
THE TEXT TEXT TEN YEARS DURING 
WHICH THEY MIGHT FOOLISHLY 
CONSIDERING LAUNCHING AN ATTACK ON 
ISRAEL WE WOULD BE ABLE TO TOTALLY 
OWE PWHREUB RATE THEM 
HOW THAT 
WENT WENT DOWN WITH THE VOTERS WE 
DON'T KNOW BUT TODAY THEY WERE OUT 
FROM EARLY ON INSIDE THE VOTING 
STATIONS OF COURSE IT'S ALL VERY 
POLITE AND FRIENDLY BUT THE BATTLE 
RAGING AT THE MOMENT AT THE TOP OF 
THE BALLOT PAPER IS GETTING 
INCREASINGLY PERSONAL INCREASINGLY 
BITTER BOTH CANDIDATES ARE TRYING 
TO LAND A KNOCKOUT BLOW 
IT'S GETTING SO NASTY THAT CLINTON 
VERSUS OBAMA HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A 
WRESTLING VIDEO CLIP SHE SLAMMED 
HIM FOR BEING ALL TALK SAYING 
ABSOLUTES SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS 
HE SMACKED BACK QUESTIONING HER 
EXPERIENCE AND SAID SHE HAD 
EXAGGERATED HER ROLE BACK CAME 
HILLARY SAYING HE IS ELITIST AND 
PATRONISING THE NEXT BARACK ATTACK 
ACCUSED HER OF INDULGING IN TRIVIAL 
POLITICS IT'S GETTING SO TENSE 
BECAUSE THE RACE IS SO CLOSE 
BARACK OBAMA IS AHEAD ON ALL COUNTS 
BUT HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES SHE 
SHE STILL CAN WIN AND THERE IS NO 
SIGN OF THE REFEREE CALLING A HALT 
SENIOR OFFICIALS THOUGH ARE 
CONCERNED 
I KNOW THAT THE CONCERNED HIGHERISH HIGHERISHLONS ARE 
WRINGING THEIR HANDS OVER THIS WE 
GET TO RUN AN ELECTION IN 
PENNSYLVANIA FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS 
BEFORE THE BIG ELECTION WE HAVEN'T 
DONE THAT IN YEARS 
WITH HILLARY 
CLINTON EXPECTED TO WIN HERE TODAY 
THIS PRIMARY PROBABLY WON'T END THE 
RACE THE FIGHT WILL ALMOST 
CERTAINLY GO TO ANOTHER ROUND 
THE BRITISH AIRPORT AUTHORITY'S 
CONTROL OF SEVEN BRITISH AIRPORTS 
MAY BE BROKEN UP AFTER THE 
COMPETITION WATCHDOG SAID 
PASSENGERS' INTERESTS WERE NOT 
BEING WELL SERVED B. A. A. OPERATES 
GATWICK AND HEATHROW WHERE IT'S 
BEEN SEVERELY CRITICISED OVER THE 
RECENT CHAOS AT TERMINAL FIVE 
HERE IS OUR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT 
IT'S NOT EASY RUNNING AN AIRPORT 
MORE PASSENGERS TIGHTER SECURITY 
DEMANDING AIRLINES THAT'S ON A 
NORMAL DAY OPENING A NEW TERMINAL 
PROVED TO BE A RECIPE FOR DISASTER 
THE COMPETITION COMMISSION HAS 
CONCLUDED HAVING ONE BIG COMPANY 
OWNING EVERYTHING IS BAD FOR 
COMPETITION AND THAT'S BAD FOR 
PASSENGERS SO THE COMMISSION IS 
THINKING OF BREAKING UP B. A. A.'S 
EMPIRE IT SAYS GLASGOW AND 
EDINBURGH SHOULD BE COMPETING WITH 
EACH OTHER B. A. A. MAY HAVE TO SELL 
ONE OF THEM THE SAME FOR HEATHROW 
GATWICK OR STANSTED GATWICK'S THE 
MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE B. A. A. WANTS TO 
CONCENTRATE ON HEATHROW 
I DON'T 
THINK GATWICK SHOULD BE SOLD OFF 
BUT I DO THINK HEATHROW IS A VERY 
PARTICULAR CASE AND WE NEED TO GIVE 
CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE HEATHROW 
INVESTMENTS REQUIRED THE THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT PASSENGERS 
ARE WILLING TO SWITCH BETWEEN 
AIRPORTS AS LONG AS THEY'RE OWNED 
BY DIFFERENT OPERATORS EACH 
COMPETING TO OFFER A BETTER SERVICE 
IN FACT SOME AIRLINES BELIEVE THERE 
SHOULD BE DIFFERENT TERMINALS OWNED 
BY DIFFERENT COMPANIES ALL 
COMPETING AT GATWICK VIRGIN 
BELIEVES BEING ABLE TO NEGOTIATE 
WITH DIFFERENT AIRPORT OWNERS WOULD 
MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE 
WE AS AN 
AIRLINE COULD GO TO THAT AIRPORT 
AND SAY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO 
ATTRACT US TO USE YOUR AIRPORT HOW 
ARE YOU GOING TO IMPROVE FACILITIES 
FOR PASSENGERS HOW ARE YOU GOING 
TO SPEED THINGS UP AND HOW ARE YOU 
GOING TO ACTUALLY LAY OUT A ROADMAP 
FOR A BETTER SERVICE IN FUTURE 
HERE IS WHAT PASSENGERS AT GATWICK 
WANT 
TO HAVE MORE STAFF IN THE WANT AIRPORT AND TO HAVE IT EASIER LAID 
OUT 
TOO MANY QUEUES CUT THE OUT QUEUES DOWN THAT'S THE PROBLEM I I WOULD LIKE TO SEE LESS OF THE 
SHOPPING CENTRE ENVIRONMENT THAT 
YOU FEEL HERDED INTO 
AND THE 
GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED TODAY THE 
CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY ANOTHER 
WATCHDOG WHICH DECIDES B. A. A.'S INCOME 
IS TO BE INVESTIGATED TO MAKE SURE 
IT'S UP TO THE JOB OF KEEPING B. A. A. 
UNDER CONTROL 
FIVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT IN A GAS 
EXPLOSION AT A DISUSED PUB IN LEEDS 
EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE CALLED TO 
THE FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE IN THE 
BURMANTOFTS AREA OF THE CITY AT 
LUNCHTIME NONE OF THE INJURIES ARE 
THOUGHT TO BE LIFE THREATENING 
LIVERPOOL AND CHELSEA FACE EACH 
OTHER IN THE SEMI FINALS OF THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TONIGHT FOR THE 
THIRD TIME IN FOUR FOUR SEASONS 
LIVERPOOL HAVE WON THE TWO PREVIOUS 
TIES BUT ON BOTH OCCASIONS HAD THE 
ADVANTAGE OF PLAYING AT HOME IN THE 
SECOND LEG TONIGHT THEY PLAY THE 
FIRST LEG AT ANFIELD OUR SPORTS 
CORRESPONDENT IS THERE THIS MUST 
BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST CLASHES YOU 
COULD POSSIBLY HAVE IN FOOTBALL WE WE ARE USED TO HAVING BIG GAMES HERE 
AT ANFIELD A FANTASTIC EUROPEAN 
PEDIGREE TODAY THERE IS A COCKTAIL 
OF EMOTIONS RUNNING THROUGH THE AIR 
HERE NUMBER ONE PRIDE THIS IS A 
HUGE NIGHT NOT JUST FOR ENGLISH 
FOOTBALL BUT FOR EUROPEAN FOOTBALL 
IT'S A SEMI FINAL WE MIGHT THINK 
OF THIS AS A DOMESTIC AFFAIR BUT 
THE EYES OF EUROPE MAYBE THE WORLD 
ARE ON ANFIELD TONIGHT L. HAVE SEEN 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE F. A. 
STROLLING PAST NO DOUBT WONDERING 
WHY ENGLISH CLUBS DO BETTER THAN 
THE ENGLISH NATIONAL TEAM NUMBER 
TWO WE HAVE PLENTY OF EXCITEMENT AS 
YOU SAID THESE ARE TWO WELL 
RESPECTED OLD FOES LIVERPOOL HAVE 
HAD THE UPPER HAND IN THE LAST TWO 
ENCOUNTERS NUMBER THREE IN THE AIR 
IS A CERTAIN TREP EDUCATION AND IT 
HAS TO BE SAID AGGRESSION TOWARDS 
THE CO OWNERS OF LIVERPOOL AND IN 
PARTICULAR TOM HICKS THE AMERICAN 
WHO HAS THAT FIFTY PER CENT STAKE A MAN NOT 
LIKED BY MANY SUPPORTERS WE ARE 
TOLD HE HAD ADVICE FROM THE POLICE 
TO STAY AWAY IT SEEMS AS IF HE 
WILL BE AT THE GAME TONIGHT WHAT 
SORT OF RECEPTION HE GETS WE CAN 
ONLY WAIT AND SEE L. SUSPECT IT 
WILL NOT BE A VERY WARM ONE THANK THANK YOU YOU MANY COUPLES PLANNING THEIR WEDDING 
DREAM OF TYING THE KNOT IN A 
PICTURESQUE CHURCH BUT MANY HAVE 
BEEN TURNED DOWN BECAUSE CHURCH OF 
ENGLAND RULES WHICH SAY YOU HAVE TO 
LIVE OR WORSHIP IN THE PARISH BUT 
THOSE RULES COULD BE ABOUT TO 
CHANGE AS ROBERT HALL REPORTS 
IT WAS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF 
HER LIFE JUST NOT IN THE RIGHT 
PLACE 
I ALWAYS WANTED TO GET PLACE MARRIED IN THAT CHURCH 
JUDY HAD 
DREAMT OF MARRYING IN HER HOME 
VILLAGE IN THE CHURCH WHERE HER 
PARENTS SAID THEIR VOWS BUT BECAUSE 
SHE MOVED AWAY THE ANSWER FROM THE 
VICAR WAS A VERY FIRM NO 
MY MOTHER 
CLEANED THE CHURCH SO I SPENT MANY 
A FRIDAY PLAYING IN THE CHURCH 
HELPING HER CLEAN L. WAS BAPTISED 
THERE CONFIRMED THERE L. WAS 
DEVASTATED IT HAD BEEN MY DREAM IF 
I EVER GOT MARRIED WHICH I DID 
WAS TO MARRY IN THAT CHURCH AND HE 
REMOVED THAT 
IN JUDY'S CASE THE 
DECISION MEANT A CIVIL CEREMONY IN 
A LOCAL HOTEL ONE CONSEQUENCE OF A 
MARRIAGE ACT PASSED ALMOST SIX 
DECADES AGO IT DECREED THAT 
COUPLES MUST MARRY IN THE PARISH 
WHERE THEY LIVE IT'S STRICTLY 
ENFORCED AND ANY VARIATION REQUIRES 
A SPECIAL LICENCE FROM THE 
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY SO WHAT 
DOES THIS RELAXATION MEANS WHEN IT 
COMES TO YOUR QUALIFICATIONS FOR 
BEING MARRIED IN A PARTICULAR 
CHURCH WELL UNDER THE CHANGES YOU 
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO IF YOU HAD 
BEEN BAPTISED OR CONFIRMED HERE IF 
YOU LIVED OR BEEN TO CHURCH IN THIS 
PARISH FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS IF 
YOUR PARENTS HAVE LIVED OR BEEN TO 
CHURCH HERE OVER THE SAME PERIOD 
AND IF YOUR GRANDPARENTS WERE 
MARRIED HERE 
THE MOVE'S NOT SEEN AS AN OCCASION 
TO CELEBRATE IN SOME OF THE U. K.'S 
MOST DESIRABLE WEDDING LOCATIONS 
THIS IS THE VILLAGE OF SHEARER IN 
SURREY SHERE IN SURREY WHERE 
THERE ARE FEAR IT IS WILL LEAD TO 
MARRIAGE TOURISM 
PEOPLE COME FOR 
SPIRITUAL REASONS FOR THE RIGHT 
REASONS TO VISIT THE HISTORY AND 
IT'S A PEACEFUL CHURCH TO JUST 
COME BECAUSE IT LOOKS PRETTY IN 
YOUR PICTURES TO ME IS ALMOST 
BLASPHEMOUS 
THE NEW RULES MAY BLASPHEMOUS COUNTERTHE FALLING NUMBER OF CHURCH 
MARRIAGES BUT DON'T BOOK YET 
THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO TAKE EFFECT 
UNTIL LATER THIS YEAR 
IT LOOKED NICE OUT THERE LET'S SEE 
WHAT IS IN STORE DARREN CAN TELL 
US 
SUPERDAY FOR A WEDDING DAY 
TOMORROW IS AN IMPROVING STORY 
REALLY BECAUSE TONIGHT WE HAVE A 
BIT OF A CHANGE WE HAVE A NARROW 
BAND OF RAIN THAT'S MOVING SLOWLY 
FROM WEST TO EAST IT SHOULD BE 
FINE FORRED BIG GAME AT ANFIELD 
THIS EVENING BUT BEFORE MIDNIGHT WE 
WILL SEE RAIN IN THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
AND THIS NARROWING BAND OF RAIN 
SLOWLY WORKS ITS WAY EASTWARDS 
AHEAD OF THE RAIN IN PARTICULAR 
WATCH OUT FOR SOME MIST AND PATCHY 
FOG IT'S AHEAD OF THE RAIN THAT WE 
SEE THE LOWEST TEMPERATURES 
TOMORROW THE STORY IS FOLLOWING 
THIS WEAKENING BAND OF RAIN AS IT 
WORKS SLOWLY EASTWARDS BEHIND THAT 
YOU CAN SEE THE SUNSHINE SPREADING 
IN ACROSS MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
THIS RAIN TAKING A WHILE TO CLEAR 
FROM EASTERN COASTAL AREAS IF WE 
LOOK AT SCOTLAND IN THE AFTERNOON 
FOUR POINT OH OH STILL BREEZY STILL RATHER 
DAMP ACROSS THE FAR NORTHEAST BUT 
THE REST OF SCOTLAND SEES LIGHTER 
WINDS AND SOME SUNSHINE AS WELL 
SO FEELING VERY PLEASANT YOU CAN 
SEE THE SUNSHINE THAT SPREADS IN 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON ACROSS MUCH 
OF NORTHERN ENGLAND STILL GREY AND 
DAMP FOR A WHILE ACROSS THE COAST 
OF LINCOLNSHIRE INTO EAST ANGLIA 
DOWN TO KENT BUT EVENTUALLY WE WILL 
SEE THE SUNSHINE PUSHING BACK INTO 
LONDON AND IT WILL TURN OUT TO BE 
WARM AT EIGHTEEN C. A DECENT DAY FOR THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WITH THE 
RAIN GONE OVERNIGHT MOST OF THE 
TIME IT WILL BE DRY JUST ONE OR 
TWO LIGHT SHOWERS AND SOME GOOD 
SPELLS OF SUNSHINE ACROSS WALES 
SOME SUNSHINE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
BUT WATCH OUT FOR THE ODD LIGHTISH 
SORT OF SHOWER LOW PRESSURE IS 
DRIVING THE WEATHER THE NEXT 
WEATHER FRONT INTO THURSDAY IS 
GOING TO BE MORE ACTIVE THE
