AT THE WILD FRONTIER WHERE THE ATLANTIC OCEAN DIVIDES 
AROUND THE GRANITE SKIRTS OF LANDS END 
ONE MAN PURSUES HIS PASSION 
STEPHEN WESTCOTT HAS SPENT TWO DECADES 
EXPLORING THIS REMOTE COASTLINE 
AND UNCOVERING THE SECRET LIFE OF CORNISH GREY SEALS 
LYME REGIS TO LANDS END OCCASIONALLY GALE EIGHT AT FIRST 
I THINK OF THIS PLACE AS THE EDGE OF THE WORLD 
MY WORKING LIFE IS SPENT IN THIS DYNAMIC MARGIN 
BETWEEN THE FAMILIAR LAND 
AND THE LESS PREDICTABLE OCEAN RIM 
I STARTED OFF BY LOVING SURFING 
AND BEING IN THE SEA 
NOW I'M IN THE SEA EVERY DAY STUDYING CREATURES THAT LIVE BETWEEN 
THE LAND AND THE SEA EVERY DAY 
THE ATTRACTION WAS 
VERY LITTLE WORK HAD BEEN DONE WHICH WAS A GREAT SHOCK TO ME 
I THOUGHT WELL IT'S SO EASY TO FIND OUT 
AS LONG AS YOU ARE ABLE TO 
TO LIVE WITH THE SEA AS IT WERE AND I CAN 
FROM JULY ONWARDS THE SEALS ARE BREEDING 
AND I'M BUSY LOOKING FOR THEIR SECRET PUPS 
BECAUSE PUP NUMBERS ARE A RELIABLE SIGN 
OF HOW WELL THE LOCAL SEALS ARE DOING 
THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE SEA RAGING I CAN'T GET ONTO THE WATER 
BUT BY LOW TIDE I KNOW OF OTHER ROUTES TO EXPLORE THE SEALS' DOMAIN 
AT THE TOP OF THIS BOULDER BEACH IS A NARROW SEA CAVE 
WHICH MIGHT SHELTER WHAT I'M AFTER 
NOW WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE 
IS A POOL THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY METRES LONG AND ABOUT FOUR METRES WIDE 
UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A SEAL MOTHER IN THE POOL THERE 
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO BEYOND IT 
BUT IF WE'RE TO FIND HOW MANY PUPS ARE BORN IN THIS CAVE THIS YEAR 
IT HAS TO BE DONE WHILE CONDITIONS ARE GOOD 
READY TO PROCEED 
UGH 
I'D JUST LIKE HER TO SUBMERGE 
THAT'S BETTER 
IT'S BETTER 
O. K. LET'S GO 
IF YOU LOOK ABOUT YOU HERE YOU SEE A CAVE THAT'S CATHEDRAL HIGH 
SO IT'S A WONDERFUL PLACE TO BE IN JUST IN ITSELF 
IN THIS AMAZING ENVIRONMENT 
THIS MOST IMPROBABLE ENVIRONMENT THE SEAL PUPS ARE BORN 
WHICH SEEMS SOMETHING OF A MIRACLE 
I'D SAY THIS PUP IS AT LEAST TWO WEEKS OLD 
IT'S ACTUALLY GETTING CLOSE TO THE POINT WHERE IT WILL BE WEANED 
AFTER THEY'RE WEANED 
AFTER THEY'VE BEEN IN THE WORLD FOR LESS THAN THREE WEEKS 
THEY THEN HAVE TO TEACH THEMSELVES TO SWIM IF THEY HAVEN'T LEARNED ALREADY 
AND THEN THEY ALSO HAVE TO TEACH THEMSELVES TO FORAGE FOR FOOD 
AND THEY DO THIS BY DIVING REPEATEDLY FOR 
WELL FOR STUFF 
FOR STUFF LIKE THIS 
FOR SEAWEED FOR STONES 
FOR SEASHELLS 
I MAKE THAT SOUND JUST TO BE REASSURING 
BIT OF A SHOCK FOR A LITTLE SEAL PUP TO SEE A HUMAN COME INTO A PLACE 
WHERE IT'S ONLY SEEN SEALS AND SURF AND ROCK AND SAND AND SEAWEED 
BUT FOR ME IT'S HALF FAMILIAR 
BUT IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE A PLACE TO BE COMPLACENT 
I CAN NEVER AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT IN A PLACE LIKE THIS 
AS THE TIDE TURNS THE CAVE HAS BECOME LESS SAFE 
IT'S TIME TO LEAVE 
A FRAGMENT OF BEACH WILL REMAIN 
WHERE THE PUP WILL STAY HIGH AND DRY 
FOR THE ADULTS THOUGH THEY'RE IN THEIR ELEMENT 
AND I LOVE TO WATCH THEM DANCE IN A SEA THAT WOULD PULVERISE ME 
THERE'S AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF VITALITY HERE IN THE WATER AS YOU CAN SEE 
AND YET THE SEALS YOU LOOK AT THEM AND THEY'RE HARDLY MOVING AT ALL 
DESPITE ALL THE MASSIVE MOVEMENTS OF WATERS GOING ON 
IT'S AS IF THEIR FULL OF HOLES AS THOUGH THE POWER OF THE SEA 
GOES THROUGH THEM AND DOESN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT 
SEALS ARE THE REASON FOR ME TO EXPLORE THIS ENCHANTED WORLD 
BUT IT'S MORE THAN JUST THEM 
IT'S KESTRELS MASTERING THE UPDRAUGHTS 
TURNSTONES IN THE MUSSEL BEDS 
IT'S THE LIGHT THE COLOURS THE EVERYTHING 
THE WATER IS CALMER TODAY 
IT'S TIME TO UNLEASH THE WAVESKI 
PERFECT CONDITIONS TO PADDLE OUT TO GREAT CAVE 
YEE HOO 
THIS IS AN ISLAND WHERE THE BIRDS NEST IN THE SPRING TIME 
SHAGS AND HERRING GULLS 
UP HERE 
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATTERNING ON THE WALLS HERE 
FOR ME THIS RESEMBLES NOTHING MORE THAN THE HIDE OF AN ELEPHANT 
FEMALE SEAL 
GOOD SIGN 
GOOD SIGN POSSIBILITY OF PUPS 
AND DEAD AHEAD OF US IS THE ENTRANCE TO THE CAVE PROPER 
THE WAVESKI GIVES ME ACCESS TO THESE REMOTE NURSERIES 
AT HIGH TIDE THEY ECHO TO THE THUNDEROUS DRUMMING OF THE SEA 
THIS IS ANOTHER SEAL PUP IN TREMENDOUSLY GOOD CONDITION 
VERY POWERFUL CLEARLY NOT DISTURBED 
BY EITHER THE SOUND OR THE SMELL OF US 
SEE THE WAY IT MOVES 
IT LIFTS THE FRONT OF THE BODY UP 
DOES A SORT OF BREASTSTROKE THROUGH THE SAND 
BUT THE HIND PART OF THE BODY IS DRAGGED ALONG THE SAND 
IN EFFECT AS A DEAD WEIGHT 
THIS CRY IS SAYING I'M HUNGRY I WANT MY MUM TO COME AND FEED ME 
THIS ISN'T DISTRESS BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY 
WHAT MAKES THIS SUCH A GREAT CAVE FOR PUPS TO BE BORN IN 
THERE'S ALWAYS A BEACH AT HIGH TIDE WHICH IS IDEAL 
BUT THE OTHER THING ABOUT THIS CAVE WHICH IS SO WONDERFUL IS 
WHEN THIS PUP IS ONE YEAR OLD FIVE YEARS OLD 
TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD 
IT'LL COME TO THIS CAVE TO MOULT AND IT'LL DO THAT 
IN A GREAT ASSEMBLY OF SEALS PERHAPS AS MANY AS FIFTY LYING ON THIS BEACH 
AND ALL OF THEM MOULTING IN THE HEART OF WINTER 
ON THE WAY OUT OF THE CAVE 
THERE WAS ONE FINAL TREAT IN STORE 
IT'S A PUP 
IT'S JUST DOWN ON THE BOTTOM 
JUST DOWN HERE FOR THE MINUTE 
HERE 
THERE HE IS 
I ALWAYS FEEL IT'S A PRIVILEDGE TO WITNESS SUCH A RITE OF PASSAGE 
A PUP LEAVING THE DARKNESS AND SANCTUARY OF THE CAVE 
AND SWIMMING THROUGH THE THREADS OF SUNLIGHT TO THE OCEAN BEYOND 
FOR ME THERE'S NO SWEETER INSPIRATION
