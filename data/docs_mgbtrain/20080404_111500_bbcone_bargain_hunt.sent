I IMMEDIATELY OFFERED HIM THIRTY HE SNATCHED MY HAND OFF YOU ARE GOING TO DO TERRIBLY WELL THANKS 
NOW FOR THE BLUES DEBS WHAT MADE YOU WORK IN THE THEATRE 
A MAJOR LOVE OF THEATRE I ALWAYS WANTED TO WORK THERE

O. K. LET'S MOVE ON 
RUTH WHAT DO YOU DO IN THE THEATRE 
I HAVE THE UNENVIABLE JOB OF TRYING TO KEEP UNDER CONTROL 
ALL THOSE PEOPLE WITH VERY ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENTS WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT 
WHAT'S YOUR TECHNIQUE THEN 
ARE YOU MORE OF A CARROT OR A STICK GIRL 
A BIT OF BOTH DEPENDING ON WHO IT IS I'M WORKING WITH 
I UNDERSTAND YOU ALSO ENJOY MAKING SPEECHES 
I FOUND MYSELF IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO MAKE A SPEECH WHEN THE THEATRE WAS NOMINATED FOR AN AWARD 
I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE THEATRE WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO RECEIVE THE AWARD 
SO I WAS THERE TOTALLY UNPREPARED 
I HAD TO DO IT COMPLETELY OFF THE CUFF 
I CAN'T REMEMBER A WORD OF WHAT I SAID 
WERE THERE ANY FAMOUS PEOPLE THERE THERE WERE A FEW FAMOUS ACTORS AND ACTRESSES 
DID THEY CONGRATULATE YOU THEY WANTED MY AUTOGRAPH YOU WERE A GREAT SUCCESS 
WELL I TELL YOU YOU WON'T HAVE TO MAKE ANY SPEECHES TODAY BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE THESE THREE HUNDRED SMACKERS 
YOUR EXPERT AWAITS OFF YOU GO 
DON'T FORGET SPEND YOUR MONEY VERY VERY WISELY 
STRUTTING WITH THE REDS IS OUR STARLET 
AND DIRECTING THE BLUES TOWARDS CENTRE STAGE IS LEADING LIGHT 
ANYTHING TAKE YOUR FANCY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS YEAH I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THAT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I LIKE IT WHO IS IT BY 
IT'S QUITE AN UNUSUAL DESIGN 
THE NAME ASSOCIATED WITH THIS WORK IS MABEL LUCIE ATTWELL 
THIS ISN'T SIGNED AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE IT'S NOT ONE OF HER DESIGNS 
BUT IT'S AN UNUSUAL DESIGN OF THE PLANE AND THE DUCKS REALLY NICE 
I THINK THAT'S QUITE FUN WHERE DID ARCHIE GO LET'S GET HIS OPINION ARCHIE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS 
I'M NOT INSTANTLY LIKING IT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT IT 
BUT THAT SAID WITH YOUR CURRENT CONDITION 
A BABY'S PLATE YOU ARE EXPECTING A BABY SO MAYBE IT'S FATE KATE 
LET'S LOOK AT THE BOTTOM 
THIS IS BETTER WE HAVE A CARLTONWARE MARK ON THE BOTTOM 
A BRITISH FACTORY IN STOKE ON TRENT IN STAFFORDSHIRE 
THE NICE THING ABOUT THAT IS IT'S AN EARLY MARK 
NOT THE SCRIPT MARK BUT THIS CIRCLE WITH THE CROWN ON 
I THINK IT COULD DATE FROM NINETEEN HUNDRED TO NINETEEN TWENTIES SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SO IT'S GOT SOME AGE ON IT YEAH 
IT'S REALLY HEAVY IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL BIT OF POTTERY 
I'M STARTING TO LIKE IT I THINK WE COULD GO SOMEWHERE WITH THAT FOR THE RIGHT MONEY 
AS I SAID TO NEIL THE UNUSUAL THING IS THE OUTSIDE PATTERN THIS BORDER ON A BLACK GROUND 
IT STANDS OUT I THINK THAT'S QUITE FUN YES WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD MAKE AT AUCTION 
IF WE'VE GOT TWO PEOPLE AFTER THIS THIS MIGHT MAKE AS MUCH AS MAYBE THIRTY OR FORTY ON A REALLY GOOD DAY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK BOYS YEAH I'M FOR IT 
I'LL DO SOME NEGOTIATING SEE YOU IN A MINUTE O. K. THANK YOU 
KATE BOUGHT THE PLATE FOR TWENTY FIVE A PIECE OF CAKE 
DAVID RUTH 
LOOK AT THIS SO WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS THEN 
IT'S A STIRRUP CUP SURELY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT LAST NIGHT YES 
WHILST WE WERE DRINKING OUR CHAMPAGNE OUT OF A STIRRUP CUP 
THE FUNNY THING WITH THESE IS THEY SEEM TO BE MORE POPULAR NOW 
BECAUSE OF THE HUNTING BAN WHICH IS TOTALLY BIZARRE 
SO SOME GOOD COMES OUT OF ALL CHANGES DOESN'T IT 
WHO IS IT BY ROYAL STRATFORD 
A GOOD MAKER NOT PARTICULARLY OLD 
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE AS AN OLD ONE A VICTORIAN ONE WITH A NICE SILVER TOP YES 
HOWEVER BIG BIG BUCKS BUT A BONNY LITTLE THING 
IT'S A CHOCOLATE LAB WHICH IS UNUSUAL YOU'RE RIGHT 
A REAL GOOD HUNTING DOG YES 
DO YOU LIKE IT ENOUGH TO BUY IT I LOVE THIS 
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT SHE WOULD SHE'S A DOGGY LADY 
IT'S GONNA BE CALLED HUMPHREY OH I SAY AFTER WHO 
MY DOG IS HE A CHOCOLATE LAB 
NO HE'S A BOXER OH HE'LL BE DELIGHTED 
WELL IT'S ALL RIGHT BUT HOW MUCH IS IT 
THEY ARE WANTING THIRTY FIVE 
WE DON'T WANT TO BE PAYING THAT DO WE NO WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT D'YOU THINK TWENTY DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET IT FOR TWENTY 
YOU CAN HAVE A GO YOU CAN ALWAYS GO UP 
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE IT O. K. 
O. K. YOUR PURCHASE DEBS 
O. K. THEN I'LL DO IT 
THEY SNAPPED UP THE POOCH FOR TWENTY 
GO ON 
OH IT'S GREAT TO BE EXCITED 
I'VE JUST HAD A BIT OF A FIND 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
THE FIRST THING YOU MIGHT ASK IS WHAT IS IT 
ACTUALLY THAT'S A KNIFE REST 
SOMETHING THAT THE VICTORIAN HOUSEWIFE LOVED TO HAVE ON HER DINING TABLE OR SIDEBOARD 
BECAUSE IF YOU WERE CARVING UP A BIT OF MEAT AND YOU HAD A FILTHY KNIFE 
AND DIDN'T WANT TO PUT IT ON THE TABLE CLOTH 
YOU WOULD SIMPLY LEAN IT ON A KNIFE REST LIKE THAT READY TO CARVE UP ANOTHER SLICE OF TURKEY 
SO IT HAD A PRACTICAL PURPOSE IN THE VICTORIAN PERIOD AND A LOT OF PEOPLE 
COLLECT THESE KNIFE RESTS TODAY BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF WORKMANSHIP AND STYLE AND VARIETY IN THEM 
I HAPPEN TO LOVE THIS ONE 
BECAUSE IT'S GOT EMBEDDED INTO THE GLASS IN THE TOP A STRAND OF A CANE 
IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AT THAT YOU CAN SEE IT'S WHITE PINK AND BLUE 
TO DO THAT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT 
BECAUSE THAT'S MOLTEN GLASS DRAWN OUT INTO A THIN STRAND AND THEN EMBEDDED INTO THAT BAR 
AND EVEN MORE EXCITING I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'VE FOUND THE OTHER ONE 
THEY COME IN A PAIR 
THE NEXT REALLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT I FOUND THEM AT A GOOD PRICE 
HOW MUCH FOR THE PAIR 
WELL SEVENTEEN WAS THE PRICE 
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE I THINK THESE WERE PROBABLY MADE 
EITHER BY BACCARAT OR CLICHY IN FRANCE AROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND IF I'M RIGHT THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE WORTH BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
SO SEVENTEEN IS WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A BARGAIN 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS HANDBAG I THINK IT'S VERY YOU 
THERE'S A NICE SELECTION WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE OR SOME OF THE OTHERS 
YOU COULD SET IT OFF WITH THIS LOOK I DON'T THINK SO 
A NICE GOLD COMBINATION I THINK THIS IS A POTENTIAL ITEM SERIOUSLY IT'S QUITE NICE 
I DO LIKE IT IT LOOKS LIKE A DISCO BALL THAT ROTATES 
GUYS I DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE YOU ON THIS STAND 
NO WE FEEL STRANGELY ATTRACTED TOWARDS THIS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK HONESTLY 
YES WE DO YEAH 
IT IS VERY FUNKY AND VERY FIFTIES 
IT'S LIKE A BARREL BAG IT IS ACTUALLY HEAVY 
IT IS METAL ON THE OUTSIDE HERE WITH THIS PLATING TO GIVE IT THE GOLD AND SILVER CHEQUERED LOOK 
THIS PLASTIC HANDLE IS LIKE PERSPEX 
USED A LOT IN THE FIFTIES IT IS VERY RETRO GUYS 
AS LONG AS WE HAVE A FEMALE AUCTIONEER WE'LL BE FINE YEAH 
SO WHAT'S THE PRICE TAG IT'S THIRTY FIVE 
IF THIS WAS IN A VINTAGE CLOTHES SHOP ON THE KING'S ROAD IT WOULD FLY OUT 
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE AT AN AUCTION IN SHEFFIELD 
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH WILL IT MAKE IF WE GET IT FOR ABOUT TWENTY 
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR MIND'S MADE UP YEAH WE LIKE IT YEAH 
I THINK YOU NEED TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE PRICE YOU CAN O. K. 
I QUITE FANCY A BROWSE HERE MYSELF O. K. FAIR ENOUGH 
WHY DON'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO AND I'LL CATCH YOU UP 
ARCHIE LIKED THAT ONE 
ARCHIE WE HAVEN'T PAID FOR THAT YET ARCHIE 
THE BOYS EVENTUALLY PAID TWENTY FOR THE BAG 
GIRLS LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING THAT I WOULD BUY 
DO YOU LIKE IT 
YES STRANGELY 
WITH SLIGHT HESITANCY 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS A PLANT POT 
MAJOLICA ENGLISH 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY MAYBE EVEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY 
IT WAS WILD AND WHACKY THEN AND IT'S WILD AND WHACKY NOW YEAH 
IT IS SURPRISING THAT IT'S SO OLD IT IS IT'S GOT NO MARKINGS ON IT 
IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO FIND A MINTON MARK OR GEORGE JONES STAMP 
IT WOULD BE WORTH A LOT OF MONEY 
HOWEVER IT'S PRICED AT TWENTY FIVE 
IT HAS A BIT OF DAMAGE BUT THAT'S REALLY QUITE NORMAL FOR THIS STUFF 
IT DOESN'T DETRACT TOO MUCH DOES IT THOUGH THE BITS OF DAMAGE WELL IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN EFFECT 
BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT CAN TAKE A BIT OF DAMAGE AND PEOPLE THAT BUY MAJOLICA 
WILL ACCEPT THE SMALLEST BIT OF DAMAGE UNLESS THEY'RE REALLY PARTICULAR COLLECTORS OR DEALERS 
ANYONE WHO KNOWS WHAT IT IS WILL UNDERSTAND 
THAT THEY DAMAGE QUITE EASILY 
WOULD A LOT OF THIS HAVE BEEN MADE 
STACKS OF IT IT WAS VERY VERY POPULAR BUT OF COURSE BECAUSE IT'S OLD STACKS HAVE BEEN LOST 
I WANT YOU TO BE HARD IF YOU WANT IT YOU'VE GOT TO NEGOTIATE HOW MUCH YOU ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT 
HOW MUCH IS IT TWENTY FIVE TEN 
TEN TEN YEAH WELL I NEVER 
ARE YOU LEARNING FROM ME SHE'S A HARD WOMAN I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY IT FOR TEN 
WELL IF YOU CAN BUY THAT FOR TEN I WILL GIVE YOU FIFTEEN DEAL 
OFF YOU GO 
AND WITH A CRISP TEN NOTE RUTH DID THE DEAL 
A SELECTION OF VIEWERS' LETTERS 
IT'S THE BEST PROGRAMME ON T. V. 
YOUR PRESENTER HAS SUCH SKILL AND INTEGRITY 
I LOVE THE FLOW OF THE SHOW 
I WISH I COULD WATCH THE PROGRAMME FROM DAWN TILL DUSK 
I LOVE THE MOMENT WHEN THEY OPEN THE SEALED BOX TO REVEAL TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
THAT'S NOT BARGAIN HUNT 
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US WHAT YOU THINK OF THE PROGRAMME 
LOG ON TO OUR WEBSITE 
AND VISIT THE MESSAGE BOARD 
DAVID DEBS DAVID PARTICULARLY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS 
I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW 
WELL NELSON MEMORABILIA 
ANYTHING NELSON IS GOOD NEWS ISN'T IT PARTICULARLY LAST YEAR THE BICENTENARY I LIKE IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WELL DOES IT HAVE THE SAME IMPACT THIS YEAR AS IT DID LAST YEAR 
WELL NO LAST YEAR WAS THE YEAR TO BUY FOR BIG MONEY I'D HAVE THOUGHT 
BUT IT'S A SILVER PLATED RUBBED OFF WALKING STICK 
HORATIO NELSON THE FOUDROYANT NELSON'S FLAGSHIP ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE WRECKED ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN 
EVEN IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN THEY WERE STILL CELEBRATING NELSON 
HE'S NEVER BEEN UNPOPULAR 
AH OAK AND COPPER SO IT ISN'T IT IS ACTUALLY AN ORIGINAL COPPER TOP RATHER THAN SILVER PLATED 
IS IT AUTHENTIC WELL IT FEELS RIGHT 
IT'S BEATEN IT'S BEEN USED 
I'D PUT MONEY ON IT THAT THIS IS A PROPER THING HOW MUCH 
WELL TWO HUNDRED 
TWO HUNDRED IS A LOT OF MONEY BUT NOT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS I THINK 
ARE YOU CONVINCED 
I REALLY LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT AND YOU REALLY LIKE IT 
I REALLY LIKE IT BECAUSE IT HAS POTENTIAL BUT IT'S VERY CHANCY 
TWO HUNDRED NOT A CAT IN HELL'S CHANCE I WOULDN'T PAY IT 
WE HAVE GOT TO BEAT THE REDS BEAT THEM WITH A STICK 
WE PLAYED SAFE WITH THE OTHER TWO WE'RE QUITE CONFIDENT ABOUT OUR OTHER TWO PURCHASES YES 
THIS IS DEFINITELY THE RISK TO MAKE OR BREAK 
DO YOU WANT TO TRY OR WILL I WOULD YOU 
I'LL TRY I'LL COME BACK TO YOU 
THEY BEAT THE PRICE DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
SURELY ENOUGH TO GIVE THE REDS SOME STICK 
KATE WHAT DO YOU THINK TO THIS I'VE JUST FOUND HEY THIS IS NICE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS NO NO 
WELL THIS IS DOULTON 
VERY DISTINCTIVE DOULTON EARTHENWARE WITH THESE FLORETTES AROUND IT IT'S QUITE ATTRACTIVE 
IS THAT SILVER YOU'RE RIGHT THAT'S AN ENGLISH SILVER MOUNT 
THAT HELPS WITH PIECES LIKE THIS BECAUSE WE CAN PINPOINT THE DATE 
IT WAS MADE EXACTLY OR THE DATE THE SILVER WAS PUT ON IT 
IF WE HAVE A LITTLE LOOK HERE THERE IS A HALLMARK HERE WHICH IS BIRMINGHAM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT 
AND THE OTHER GOOD THING IS THAT THE MAKER OF THE SILVER IS H. AND AMP H. AS YOU CAN SEE HERE 
WHICH STANDS FOR HUKIN AND HEATH THEY WERE REALLY GOOD QUALITY SILVERSMITHS 
SO IT SHOWS THEY WERE WORKING WITH DOULTON TO PRODUCE SILVERWARE LIKE THIS OF REALLY GOOD QUALITY 
I LIKE THE MARKS ON THE BOTTOM 
THE MAKER'S MARK YEP THAT SHOWS THAT IT IS DOULTON LAMBETH 
THERE WE GO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT WE EVEN HAVE THE DATE STAMPED ON THE BOTTOM HERE 
THESE LETTERS HERE IS THAT THE MAKER 
COULD BE ONE OF THE DESIGNERS THAT'S RIGHT 
SO WE COULD LOOK THAT UP THE H. W. 
BUT IT'S A NICE LITTLE SIZE ISN'T IT 
SHALL I SEE IF I CAN HAGGLE GET IT FOR A GOOD PRICE 
YEAH WHAT'S THE TICKET PRICE SEVENTY FIVE 
WELL IF IT WAS IN REALLY GREAT CONDITION I THINK 
THAT'S NOT BAD AT AUCTION I WOULD PROBABLY PUT FIFTY TO SEVENTY ON IT 
I NOTICED A CRACK ON THE INSIDE THERE'S A LITTLE CRACK DOWN HERE 
O. K. NOW THAT WILL AFFECT IT A LITTLE BIT WHY DON'T YOU GO AND HAVE A CHAT WITH THEM 
O. K. YEAH SEE IF YOU CAN DO ANYTHING ON THE PRICE 
A BIT OF HAGGLING O. K. ALL RIGHT 
YOU'RE NOT OVER STRUCK ARE YOU NO NOT WITH THE CONDITION OF IT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WE'VE GOT ANOTHER CRACK ON THAT HANDLE 
I THINK THAT'S BEEN REPAIRED CAN YOU SEE THAT 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE HANDLE'S BEEN OFF AT SOME TIME YEAH THAT'S NOT GOOD 
THAT WILL AFFECT THE PRICE WE'D BETTER CATCH HIM UP AND MAKE SURE HE GETS IT FOR A DECENT PRICE 
COME ON THEN

HEY SISTER GO SISTER SOUL SISTER GO SISTER 
HEY SISTER GO SISTER SOUL SISTER GO SISTER 
YOU'RE LADY MARMALADE 
THIS HOUSE IS ONE OF THE MOST STUNNING TUDOR BUILDINGS IN THE COUNTRY 
IT WAS CREATED BY ELIZABETH HARDWICK COUNTESS OF SHREWSBURY 
ELIZABETH OR BESS WAS BORN IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN TO MINOR GENTRY 
WHEN SHE DIED AGED EIGHTY 
SHE HAD RISEN TO BECOME ENGLAND'S SECOND MOST WEALTHY AND POWERFUL WOMAN 
AFTER QUEEN ELIZABETH HERSELF 
THE SECRET TO BESS'S FORTUNE LAY IN HER LUCK IN MARRIAGE 
SHE MARRIED FOUR TIMES EACH HUSBAND WAS WEALTHIER THAN THE OTHER 
THE FIRST STEP ON HER SOCIAL CLIMB WAS HER MARRIAGE TO ROBERT BARLOW 
FROM WHOM SHE GAINED A MODEST INHERITANCE 
THE SECOND RUNG ON THE LADDER WAS HER MARRIAGE 
TO SIR WILLIAM CAVENDISH FROM WHOM SHE ACQUIRED AN ESTATE IN DERBYSHIRE 
THROUGH HER THIRD MARRIAGE SHE CLIMBED INTO COURT CIRCLES 
AND HER FOURTH MARRIAGE WAS TO GEORGE TALBOT THE EARL OF SHREWSBURY 
HE MADE HER A COUNTESS 
HORACE WALPOLE TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER PENNED A RHYME ABOUT HER 
FOUR TIMES THE NUPTIAL BED SHE WARMED 
AND EVERY TIME SO WELL PERFORMED THAT WHEN DEATH SPOILED EACH HUSBAND'S BILLING 
THEY LEFT THE WIDOW EVERY SHILLING 
WHICH MEANT SHE WAS RED HOT 
HUH WITH ALL HER ACCUMULATED WEALTH BESS BUILT THIS FANTASTIC HOUSE 
IT HAS ALL THE REGAL QUALITIES OF THE AGE AND IS A PALACE FIT FOR A QUEEN 
THAT WAS BESS'S LAST GREAT WISH TO SEE ONE OF HER DESCENDANTS ON THE THRONE OF ENGLAND 
THROUGH A CUNNING MARRIAGE BESS HAD ENSURED THAT HER GRANDDAUGHTER 
ARBELLA STUART HAD A CLAIM TO THE THRONE 
BUT SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE 
IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THREE QUEEN ELIZABETH DIED AND SHE NAMED JAMES THE SIXTH OF SCOTLAND AS HER HEIR 
BESS'S BID FOR POWER AND GLORY HAD COME TO AN END 
BUT HER HOPES HADN'T ALL BEEN IN VAIN 
FOUR CENTURIES AND TWELVE GENERATIONS LATER BESS'S DREAM EVENTUALLY CAME TRUE 
SHE FINALLY HAD A DESCENDENT ON THE ENGLISH THRONE QUEEN ELIZABETH THE SECOND 
NOW IT'S AUCTION TIME AND WE'RE IN SUNNY SHEFFIELD 
WELL IT'S VERY NICE TO BE AT ELR AUCTIONS WITH ROB LEE 
VERY NICE TO SEE YOU ROB THANKS FOR HAVING US 
FIRST UP FOR ARCHIE AND NEIL IS THE CARLTONWARE BABY PLATE 
NOT A PARTICULARLY BUTCH OBJECT ARE YOU INTO BABY PLATES 
I AM BECAUSE I'VE GOT THREE YOUNG BOYS AT MY HOUSE 
IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT HE'D LIKE I'M SURE BUT HE MIGHT BREAK 
NOT RIGHT FOR A PRACTICAL USE BUT PEOPLE WHO COLLECT NURSERY RELATED ITEMS WILL LOVE IT 
IT'S CERTAINLY A NICE COLLECTOR'S ITEM 
WITH THE AEROPLANE AND THE REST 
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN A BABY'S PLATE WITH AN AEROPLANE ON IT NEITHER HAVE I 
IT'S AN ATTRACTIVE PIECE AND IN CARLTON SO THAT'S DESIRABLE 
AND IT'S AN EARLY MARK AS WELL LOTS GOING FOR IT WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATE 
WE'VE SAID THIRTY TO FORTY 
VERY GOOD TWENTY FIVE THEY PAID 
I THINK YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE FOR IT GOOD 
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL 
THE DOULTON LAMBETH SILVER MOUNTED JUG WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
IT'S VERY NICE LOOKING FROM HERE BUT IF YOU GET CLOSE UP TO IT IT'S GOT A FEW LITTLE PROBLEMS 
NOTABLY THE HANDLE HAS BEEN REPLACED AND THERE'S A CRACK ON IT AS WELL 
SO THAT'S A BIG MINUS FOR IT 
OH DEAR HOW MUCH DOES THAT TAKE IT DOWN IN VALUE THEN ROB 
BECAUSE OF THAT I'D BE SAYING TWENTY TO FORTY THIRTY EIGHT THEY PAID 
IF IT HAD BEEN IN GOOD CONDITION YOU COULD'VE BEEN LOOKING AT ONE HUNDRED 
I KNOW NOW THE MIRRORED HANDBAG 
THIS IS AGAIN NOT PARTICULARLY BUTCH BUT THEN I SUPPOSE THEY'RE ATTACHED TO THE THEATRE AREN'T THEY 
THEY CERTAINLY ARE WHAT A DIFFERENT ITEM THIS IS FOR US 
SO DATING FROM WHEN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES DO YOU AGREE 
THE FIFTIES OR SIXTIES 
IT IS NOT MY STRONGEST FIELD THIS SORT OF THING WHAT HANDBAGS 
TRUE ENOUGH NO IT'S DIFFICULT FOR MOST OF US CHAPS REALLY 
BUT IT'S GOT SOMETHING ABOUT IT HASN'T IT 
VERY STYLISH STYLISH ENOUGH TO MAKE A DECENT PRICE 
I WOULD SAY TWENTY TO FORTY 
TWENTY THEY PAID 
THAT'S SPOT ON ISN'T IT 
ANYWAY THERE WE HAVE IT NOW LET'S FIND OUT ABOUT THE REDS' BONUS BUY 
O. K. BOYS LEFTOVER LOLLY MOMENT 
WHAT DID KATE BUY WITH ALL THE CASH TWO HUNDRED ODD 
IT WAS QUITE A LOT THAT YOU LEFT ME 
YOU NEEDED THE MONEY I DID LOOK HARD O. K. 
AND I FOUND THIS A LITTLE BLACK BOX 
THAT'S BRILLIANT KATE LOVELY JOB 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK THERE WE GO 
NOW I DID DETECT WITH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YOUR ITEMS THAT THERE WAS A SLIGHT GIRLIE BENT 
YEAH SO I'VE GONE FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT GIRLIE NOT A LITTLE BIT 
IN THE HOPE IT WOULD BE COMMERCIAL TOO 
IT'S AN EDWARDIAN PENDANT SET WITH PINK TOURMALINES AND LITTLE SEED PEARLS 
IN A TYPICALLY EDWARDIAN SYMMETRICAL DESIGN AND IT'S IN NINE CARAT GOLD STAMPED NINE CARAT ON THE BACK 
HOW MUCH WE'RE KEEN TO KNOW HOW MUCH YEAH HOW MUCH HOW MUCH 
I PAID FORTY FIVE FORTY FIVE WHAT POUNDS POUNDS YES 
IT SEEMS STEEP TO ME WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'LL MAKE 
I THINK IT'S GOT A CHANCE OF MAKING POSSIBLY FIVE TO TEN PROFIT 
I THINK IT HAS MORE OF A CHANCE OF MAKING JUST FIVE TO TEN 
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU LIKE EFFEMINATE STUFF DON'T YOU 
NOT REALLY ARCHIE I WASN'T THE ONE MINCING WITH THE HANDBAG 
NO THAT WAS ME HAVE A CLOSER LOOK 
IT HAS GENUINE GEMSTONES 
IT'S NOT DOING MUCH FOR ME ARE THEY REAL STONES YEAH REAL STONES REAL GEMS 
IN A NINE CARAT GOLD SETTING 
I THINK YOU'RE FLOGGING A DEAD HORSE TO THESE BOYS 
SEND IT BACK TO THE STABLE THEY'VE GOT A DEGREE OF SCEPTICISM 
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER FRANKLY ARCHIE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT 
BECAUSE AT THAT MOMENT AFTER YOU'VE SOLD THREE ITEMS 
YOU WILL KNOW WHERE YOU'RE PITCHING YOUR MONEY 
DO YOU WANT TO RISK IT ON THAT OR NOT I HAVE A FUNNY FEELING THE ANSWER MIGHT BE NO WELL 
YOU NEVER KNOW HOW DISASTROUS IT IS GOING TO BE 
IF WE'VE LOST LOADS WE MIGHT AS WELL LOSE A BIT MORE WHY NOT 
OH YE OF LITTLE FAITH YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND ABOUT THESE THEN O. K. 
ANYWAY FOR YOU GUYS AT HOME LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS 
SO HOW DOES JEWELLERY GO HERE ALL RIGHT USUALLY QUITE WELL YES 
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE TOURMALINE AND SEED PEARL DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
YES I CERTAINLY DO 
A NICE EDWARDIAN PIECE QUITE GIRLIE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIRTY TO FIFTY 
WELL OLD KATE IS A BIT OF A WIZARD ON THE JEWELLERY 
SHE PAID FORTY FIVE 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HOPE FOR THE BEST 
SO DEBS AND RUTH HAVE GONE FOR THIS STIRRUP CUP 
IT IS A LOVELY OLD IDEA HAVE A SWIG OF BOOZE ON THE HUNTING DAY AND ALL THAT BUT THAT'S GOT NO AGE TO IT 
THAT'S A BIG MINUS FOR IT 
I RECKON IT'S BEEN MADE IN THE LAST TEN OR TWENTY YEARS 
IT'S NOT A THING YOU CAN USE ANY MORE MOST OF THE HUNTING HAS BEEN BANNED NOW 
ANYWAY WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATE ON THAT TWENTY TO FORTY 
WELL THEY ONLY PAID TWENTY SO THEY STAND A CHANCE OF MAKING SOMETHING ON THAT 
THE MAJOLICA PLANTER OH IF THAT WAS ENGLISH 
YES CONTINENTAL 
COULD BE BELGIAN 
AND IT'S GOT A BIG CRACK ON IT AS WELL SO IT MAY STRUGGLE 
YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING TWENTY IF IT GOT UP TO FORTY IT'D DO VERY WELL 
WELL WE'D BE DELIGHTED WITH TWENTY THEY ONLY PAID TEN GOOD SHOW 
SO THAT'S GREAT 
NOW THIS NELSON COMMEMORATIVE STICK 
THEY'VE GONE A LONG WAY TO GET THIS STICK 
THEY PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
I'VE DONE A BIT OF RESEARCH ABOUT THE FOUDROYANT AND THAT'S WHERE IT'S FROM 
THERE IS A COPPER FINIAL ON THE TOP SAYING IT IS NELSON'S FORMER FLAGSHIP 
IT RAN AGROUND IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN OUTSIDE BLACKPOOL 
AND THE SALVAGERS CONSEQUENTLY MADE FURNITURE 
AND OTHER LITTLE KNICK KNACKS OUT OF IT AND HERE'S ONE OF THEM 
I SUPPOSE THEY MADE A LOT OF STUFF IT WAS QUITE A BIG SHIP 
THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH MANY TONNES 
SO THERE IS A LOT OF SOUVENIRWARE ABOUT OF THE FOUDROYANT 
THERE CERTAINLY IS 
THEY PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON IT'S WORTH THIRTY TO FIFTY 
OH I HAVE GOT A SINKING FEELING 
THEY'LL NEED THEIR BONUS ITEM LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DAVID HAD TO SPEND ON THE BONUS BUY 
AND IT'S UNDERNEATH THERE DO YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT IT IS YEP 
LET'S CRACK ON GET READY TO MEET A VERY BIG VERY MASSIVE MINIATURE CHEST OF DRAWERS 
I THINK THEY LOOK SICK ACTUALLY 
IS IT BECAUSE OF THE COLOUR POSSIBLY 
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT NEEDS A GOOD SCRUB 
IT NEEDS A GOOD SCRUB AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT IT 
IT'S IN AS FOUND CONDITION 
LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
I WOULD SAY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY 
TO BE SAFE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
PROBABLY CONTINENTAL SO IT'S PINE IT'S PAINTED 
IT'S GOT POTENTIAL TO THE TRADE 
AN ANTIQUE DEALER CAN BUY THAT RESTORE IT FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY OR EFFORT AND PUT HUGE VALUE ON IT 
WE WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH YOU SPENT HOW MUCH DO YOU TWO THINK I SPENT 
FIFTY 
NINETY WHAT ABOUT THE BIT THAT'S MISSING HERE 
THAT'S ALL PART OF THE RESTORATION APPEAL 
I THINK IT HAS EVERY CHANCE OF MAKING SOME MONEY BUT AGAIN IT'S A RISKY NUMBER 
HOW MUCH ONE HUNDRED FORTY I WOULD HOPE 
I'D PAY ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOR IT IF I REALLY WANTED IT DO YOU REALLY WANT IT NO 
WELL IT'S LIKE ALL THESE THINGS IN THE SALEROOMS WHO IS THERE ABOUT 
YOUR PREDICTION IS NINETY IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE FAIR ENOUGH ABSOLUTELY 
POTENTIALLY YOU COULD SEE FORTY TO FIFTY PROFIT IF THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE AFTER IT 
DOES THAT PUT IT IN A NUTSHELL JUST ABOUT 
WOULD YOU FIX IT TO A WALL OR IS IT FREE STANDING FREE STANDING IF IT HAD FOUR PROPER LEGS 
SO THREE STANDING YES 
THREE STANDING O. K. YOU'VE SEEN IT 
FOR YOU GUYS AT HOME LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT IT 
O. K. ROB WELL IF YOU WEREN'T FEELING SICK NOW IS YOUR MOMENT WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS 
I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO BAD 
NICE GLASS KNOBS ON IT IT CAN BE STRIPPED DOWN CAN'T IT 
MID NINETEENTH CENTURY 
NOT A BAD ITEM CONTINENTAL CONTINENTAL 
YEAH CERTAINLY PEOPLE LOVE MINIATURE BITS OF FURNITURE THERE'S A BIT OF NAIVETY ABOUT IT 
QUITE A LOT OF NAIVETY ACTUALLY 
ANYWAY THERE IT IS THEY PAID NINETY 
WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATE EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
WELL FAIR ENOUGH I HOPE YOU MAKE IT I JUST HAVE TO SAY 
IT'S ONE OF THE WORST QUALITY THINGS I'VE SEEN ON BARGAIN HUNT FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
O. K. GREAT WE'LL FIND OUT AT THE AUCTION 
IF YOU EVER WENT ON HOLIDAY TO CORNWALL IN THE SIXTIES OR SEVENTIES YOU COULD EASILY HAVE PICKED UP 
A PIECE OF CERAMIC LIKE THIS FOR A FEW POUNDS FIVE EIGHT TEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
IF YOU'D DONE THAT YOU'D HAVE DONE EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING 
THESE THINGS HAVE SHOT UP IN VALUE 
THEY WERE MADE BY A FACTORY CALLED TROIKA 
IT WAS SET UP IN SAINT IVES IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THE FACTORY WAS MOVED TO NEWLYN AND THE WHOLE THING WENT BUST OR THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE 
THERE'S A RELATIVELY SHORT PRODUCTION CYCLE AND THE PERIOD AND THE OBJECTS ARE QUITE CLEARLY DEFINED 
THAT'S WHAT I GUESS GOES TO MAKE A GOOD COLLECTABLE 
IT'S GOT A BEGINNING A MIDDLE AND AN END AND ALL THE DETAILS ARE RECORDED 
THEY WERE FAMED REALLY FOR THEIR GEOMETRIC DESIGNS 
WITH A NUMBER OF DESIGNERS WHO TOOK ON DIFFERENT FORMS 
THIS VASE AND THIS ONE ARE CALLED WHEEL VASES 
THEY'RE SHAPED EXACTLY LIKE A WHEEL 
IT'S IN A FORM OF STONEWARE THAT'S BEEN CUT AND INCISED AND GLAZED 
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS RATHER DRYISH TO THE TOUCH 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM IT'S GOT A MONOGRAM WHICH SAYS LJ 
THAT'S FOR LOUISE JINKS ONE OF THEIR BETTER DESIGNERS 
THIS POT IS CALLED A GEOMETRIC POT AND INCORPORATES BITS OF BODY PARTS 
YOU HAVE A HEAD AND TORSO AND JUST ONE LEG RATHER DISJOINTED 
THIS IS BY AN ARTIST CALLED DOUBLEDAY 
SO WHAT ARE THESE THINGS WORTH TODAY 
THE REALLY LARGE VASES THE ANGULAR ONES CALLED ANVIL VASES 
OR SOME OF THE AZTEC PIECES CAN MAKE ONE THOUSAND OR TWO 
BUT EACH ONE OF THESE POTS IS ESTIMATED AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
A LOT MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL PRICE 
BELIEVE YOU ME THE PRICE FOR TROIKA POTTERY HASN'T STOPPED GOING UP YET 
SO THERE'S A BIT OF A TIP WITH ALL OF THIS 
SHEFFIELD'S A LONG WAY FROM CORNWALL BUT WE'LL HOPE FOR THE BEST IN THE AUCTION
