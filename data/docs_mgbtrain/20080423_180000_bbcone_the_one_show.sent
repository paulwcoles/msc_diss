WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW WHO BETTER 
TO JOIN US ON SAINT GEORGE'S DAY THAN 
A KNIGHT O' OF THE RETT M. SIR 
DAVID FROST 
WE 
ARE NOT WORTHY YOU YOU ARE INCREDIBLY WORTHY AND 
SUCCESSFUL FIVE AND HALF MILLION VIEWERS 
LET'S LEAVE IT THERE VIEWERS SOMETIMES I SAY TO PEOPLE WE ARE 
NOT WORTHY AND THEY GO I THINK YOU 
ARE PROBABLY RIGHT BUT YOU WERE 
GENEROUS JOINING US TOO ON 
SHAKESPEARE'S BIRTHDAY OUR OWN 
ROMEO AND JULIET JUSTIN AND 
CHRISTINE IT IS A MARRIAGE MADE IN 
HEAVEN SHE WILL BE GROWING HIS 
VEGETABLES FOR HIM FOREVER IN THE 
NINETEEN FIFTIES ASBESTOS WAS SEEN AS A MAJOR 
ADVANCE BUT THE STUFF HAS CAUSED 
MORE INDUSTRIAL INJURY AND DEATH 
THAN ANY OTHER 
A HOUSE OF LORDS 
RULING HAS BLOCKED COMPENSATION IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES FOR THOUSANDS 
WITH ASBESTOS RELATED SCARRING IN 
THEIR LUNGS BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT 
STORY IN SCOTLAND NOTTINGHAMSHIRE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE WAS ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST 
MANUFACTURING HUBS THIS WOMAN'S 
FAMILY CONTRIBUTED TO THE COUNTY'S 
SUCCESS 
ALL MY BROTHERS MY DAD SUCCESS ALL WORKED IN THE POWER STATIONS 
THEY ACTUALLY LAGGED PIPES THEY THEY WORKED WITH ASBESTOS AS DID 
THOUSANDS OF WORKERS 
THOUSANDS OF WORKERS 
I'M PREPARED 
I'M PREPARED TO WORK FOR THE EMPLOYER WHAT I'M 
NOT PREPARED TO DO IT DIE FOR IT 
IT IS IN YOUR MOUTH UP YOUR 
NORBGSZ IN YOUR EYES IT GETS EVERY 
WHERE YOU WERE LIKE A SNOWMAN AT 
TYPES 
IT WAS 
THE MAGIC MINERAL OF TYPES THE POST WAR BUILDING BOOM AND 
INSULATED SCORES OF BUILDING 
BUILDINGS BUT IF YOU BREATHED IN 
THE FIBRES IT COULD BE DEVASTATING 
HOSPITAL IS WHERE MANY EMPLOYEES 
ENDED UP THE USE OF ASBESTOS WAS 
ONLY RESTRICTED IN THE MID EIGHTIES 
BUT BY THEN THE DAMAGE WAS ALREADY 
DONE 
DONE 
MY BROTHER IN LAW DIED AN DONE UNCLE DIED TWO BROTHERS DIED FROM 
IT MY DAD HAD HEART FAILURE THE 
POSTMORTEM REVEALED IT WAS ASBESTOS 
MY SISTER HAS PLURAL PLAQUES MY 
NIECE HAS IT MYSELF I HAVE GOT 
PLURAL PLAQUES LERIE WAS JUST A 
VALERIE WAS JUST A CHILD WHEN SHE WAS EXPOSED 
MY DAD 
CAME HOME IN HIS WORK CLOTHES AND I 
SAT ON HIS KNEE AND HELPED IN THE 
HOUSE MY DAD WORE OVERALLS I 
WOULD SHAKE SHAKE THEM FOR HIM L. WOULD BRUSH THE DUST OFF HIS BOOTS 
VALERIE AND THREE GENERATIONS OF 
HER FAMILY HAVE BEEN LEFT 
DEVASTATED BY THE DUST IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE SHE 
FOUND SHE HAD PLURAL PLAQUES AREAS 
OF SCARRING ON HER LUNGS THEY ARE 
CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS AND 
MAY OR MAY NOT SHORTEN HER LIFE 
THE STRESS IS ENORMOUS WHEN YOU 
DIAGNOSED IF YOU HAVE HAD FAMILY 
WHOS LOSSES IT MAKES YOU 
REALISE WHAT CAN HAPPEN HUNDREDS HUNDREDS ARE DIAGNOSED WITH PLURAL PLAQUES 
EACH YEAR BUT IN A BITTER BLOW TO 
THOSE WITH THE CONDITION T. HOUSE OF 
LORDS HAS RULED THEY CANNOT CLAIM 
COMPENSATION THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILES NORTH IN 
SCOTLAND THIS FOUNDRY WORKER IS 
STRUGGLING TO BREATHE 
IT WAS VERY 
DUSTY CUTTING UP MATERIAL WITH A 
HAND SAW HAMMERING NAILING THE 
STUFF WITHOUT ANY PROTECTION AT 
ALL NO MASKS OR ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT THIRTY ODD YEARS WENT BY AND I 
THOUGHT I MUST BE LUCKY 
RON DREAMT 
OF SPENDING HIS RETIREMENT SAILING 
BUT HIS DREAMS WERE SUNCH AFTER A 
VISIT TO THE 
I WAS STARTING TO GET 
MORE BREATHLESS SUNK THE DOCTOR 
HEARD SOMETHING IN MY CHEST L. HAD 
PLURAL PLAQUES RELUCTANTLY I HUNG 
UP MY SAILING BOOTS AND STAY AID 
SHORE 
RON HAS SUFFERED AS MUCH AS SHORE VALERIE BUT HE COULD SOON HAVE AN 
ADVANTAGE OVER SUFFERERS SOUTH OF 
THE BORDER BECAUSE THE SCOTTISH 
PARLIAMENT PLANS TO OVERRULE 
BRITAIN'S HIGHEST COURT AND MAKE IT 
EASIER FOR HIM TO CLAIM 
COMPENSATION 
THOSE WHO HAVE GOT IT COMPENSATION IN SCOTLAND ARE ENTITLED TO BE 
RECOME PENLSED AND THOSE WHO 
PROFITED IN THE PAST THROUGH THEIR 
LABOUR AND PROVIDED THE INSURANCE 
COVER HAVE TO MEET THEIR 
OBLIGATIONS 
THE ASSOCIATION OF OBLIGATIONS BRITISH INSURERS DOES NOT AGREE 
THEY THINK IF THERE IS NO INJURY 
THEN THERE SHOULD BE NO PAYMENT IF IF YOU PAY FOR PLURAL PRAK PLAQUES 
YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR OTHER 
CONDITIONS WHERE EXPOSURE LEADS TO 
ANXIETY OTHER CHEMICALS OR EVEN 
SUN LIGHT 
COME ON IT IS NOT LIKE 
GETTING A TAN EXPOSURE CAN LEAD TO 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERIOUS 
ILLNESSES 
AND EXPOSURE TO SUN ILLNESSES LIGHT CAN AND TO BENIGN LESION 
PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE ANXIOUS THE 
HOUSE OF LORDS DEMONSTRATED IT ERS 
EVIDENCE OF EXPOSURE AND NOT DOES 
LEAD TO MORE SERIOUS CONDITIONS 
IF I HAD A SCAR ON MY HAND I COULD MORE THAN LIKELY CLAIM 
COMPENSATION BECAUSE OF THAT AND A 
SCAR ON THE BACK OF MY HAND HASN'T 
GOT MUCH CHANCE OF KILLING ME 
WHETHER THEY WIN OR LOSE THE 
MEDICAL BATTLE OVER THE SCARS THE 
EMOTIONAL SCARS WILL LAST A 
LIFETIME 
I HAVE NIGHTMARE I CAN LIFETIME JUST SEE MY BROTHERS AND HEAR THE 
RASPING THEY DID L. DON'T WANT TO 
SUFFER THAT 
AS A NATION WE CAN'T 
COVERED OURSELFS IN GLORY THE WAY 
WE HAVE DEALT WITH IT 
IT SEEMS TO 
ME WE GO BACK EACH DECADE YOU 
WONDER MORE HOW LONG IT HAS TAKEN 
AND IN FACT IN SOME ONE BOOK I 
FOUND A FACT THAT WAS FASCINATING 
IN THE FIRST CENTURY AD THE ROMANS 
NOTED THEIR SLAVES WHO WERE WEAVING 
ASBESTOS GOT LUNG DISEASES THAT 
IS IN THE FIRST CENTURY AD AND IT 
IS ONLY RECENTLY AS JUSTIN POUNTED 
OUT ANYTHING HAS BEEN DONE A PLUER 
RAG PLAQUES THEY MAY NOT LEAD TO 
CANCER 
BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT CANCER THEM ANY WAY 
THE FACT YOU HAVE GOT 
THEM MEANS YOU HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO 
THE DANGER 
DO YOU THINK THE REST 
OF THE U. K. IS GOING TO TAKE 
SCOTLAND'S LEAD IN THIS 
THERE ARE 
A GROUP OF M. P.'S IN THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS WHO WANT TO BRING SIMILAR 
REDGELAITION TO THE HOUSES OF 
PARLIAMENT WHICH WOULD BE FOR 
ENGLAND AND WALES BUT THE INSURANCE 
INDUSTRY IS ADAMANT THEY SAY THE 
PLURAL PLAQUES DO NOT CREATE ANY 
ADVERSE SYMPTOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE THEM AND THEREFORE THEY 
SHOULDN'T BE COMPENSATION IF YOU 
ARE NOT SUFFERING AS A RESULT OF 
THE INJURY THEN YOU SHOULDN'T GET 
COMPENSATION THEY SAY 
HOW MUCH IS 
OUT THERE SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED 
ABOUT THIS ABOUT THE FUTURE YEARS 
AS YOU SAY 
THERE IS A LOT OUT 
THERE BECAUSE AS WE SAID IN THE 
FILM IT WAS A MIRACLE THINGS THAT 
WUZ WAS USED IN ALL SORTS OF 
BUILDINGS HOSPITALS SCHOOLS HOUSES 
BUT WE SPOKE TODAY TO THE BRITISH 
LUNG FOUNDATION THEY SAID MOST OF 
THE ASBESTOS YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
WORRY ABOUT IT IT IF HASN'T BEEN 
DAMAGED IT IS NOT A PROBLEM IT'S 
THE FIBRE THE DUST SO THE PEOPLE 
AT DANGER ARE FRAITS TRADESMEN F. 
YOU HAVE WORRIES GO TO YOUR LOCAL 
AUTHORITY AND THEY CAN CHECK IT OUT 
FOR YOU 
WE LIKE TO THINK THE ONE 
SHOW IS TODAY'S ONE STOP SHOP FOR 
AN ENTERTAINING AND INFORMATIVE 
LOOK AT THE BRITAIN WE ARE IN YES 
THAT IS WHAT WE LIKE TO THINK IT IS 
DO YOU AGREE BEFORE WE CAME ON THE 
SCENE THERE WAS A CERTAIN SIR DAVID 
FROST PRE KNIGHTHOOD HE LED THE 
WAY WITH THE FROST REPORT HERE IS 
THAT FAI FAMOUS SHOW'S FAMOUS 
TAKEN TO CLASS SYSTEM 
I LOOK DOWN 
ON HIM BECAUSE I AM UPPER CLASS ONE I LOOK UP TO HIM BECAUSE HE IS UPPER 
CLASS BUT I LOOK DOWN ON HIM 
BECAUSE HE IS LOWER CLASS L. AM 
MIDDLE CLASS 
I KNOW MY PLACE TWO TWO RONNIES AND ONE JOHN CLEESE FROM 
THE FROST REPORT WE CHOSE THAT IN 
THE LIGHT AFTER NEW REPORT CLAIMING 
THE WORKING CLASS AND MIDDLE CLASS 
ARE UNDERGOING AN IDENTITY CRISIS 
FIRST HERE IS THE VIEW OF THE ONE 
SHOW'S RESIDENT POSH BLOKE THE 
CLASS SYSTEM IS BRITISH OTHER 
COUNTRIES HAVE CLASS DIFFERENCES 
BUT WE ARE IN CLASS OF OUR OWN 
YOU WILL FIND IT IN HOW WE DRESS 
HOW WE RELAX IT IS WHERE WE WENT 
TO SCHOOL IT IS WHERE WE LIVE AND 
HOW WE SPEAK 
THE WINDS OF CHANGE 
ARE BLOWING RIGHT THROUGH THIS 
PLACE 
OH YES 
THESE ADD UP TO PLACE DISTINCT CLASS DISTINCTIONS THEY THEY USED TO WRITE ON THE CHURCH WALLS 
GOD BLESS THE SQUIRE AND HIS 
RELATIONS AND KEEP US ALL TO OUR 
PROPER STATIONS 
I KNOW MY PLACE 
BUT ALL BEGAN TO CHANGE UNDER 
MARGARET THATCHER THE IRON LADY 
TOLD US YOU DIDN'T NEED TO BE BORN 
WITH SILVER SPOON IF YOUR MOUTH 
TO GET ON IN LIFE 
HARDLY SURPRISING THEN THAT THE 
SUN OF TRAPEZE ARTIST WHO LEFT 
SCHOOL AT SIXTEEN AND WHOSE FIRST 
AMBITION WAS TO A BUS DRIVER 
FOLLOWED AS THE NEXT TORY PRIME 
MINISTER MINISTER JOHN MAJOR INHERITED MAGGIE'S 
CLASSLESS SOCIETY 
BUT NOW CLASS IS BACK WITH US 
EXCEPT IT ISN'T QUITE AS CLEAR CUT 
AS IT USED TO BE PEOPLE SOMETIMES 
SAY WHO AM I WHERE WHERE AM I 
WHERE DO I BELONG AND THESE ARE 
NATURAL QUESTIONS AND THEY ARE VERY 
DIFFICULT TO ANSWER IN SOCIETY 
WHICH I THINK AT THE MOMENT HAS 
BEEN A STATE OF FLUX AND HERE IS 
WHERE THE NEW CLASS IS CARVING OUT 
A NEW NAME FOR ITSELF 
ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH CARDIFF 
IS THE CAPITAL OF THIS CLASS 
CONFUSION T. R. A. DITIONLY IN BRITAIN 
WE HAVE HAD THREE CLASS UPPER 
CLASS TRADITIONALLY 
MIDDLE CLASS 
WORKING CLASS WORKING CLASS 
WORKING CLASS AND HAPPY HIGHER HIGHER WORKING CLASS MAYBE 
MIDDLE CLASS 
SOCIETY 
YOU THINK YOU ARE MIDDLE SOCIETY CLASS THAT IS YOUR HAT FOR YOU SIR 
SHE LOOKS MORE LIKE THE DUCHESS OF 
CORNWALL TO ME IN IF I MIGHT SAY 
SO YOU ARE MIDDLE CLASS YOU DON'T 
LIVE IN A COUNCIL HOUSE 
I WANT HER 
HAT 
EVERYONE WANTS TO BE MIDDLE HAT CLASS 
THIS IS THE MIDDLE CLASS HAT CLASS WE HAVE 
I WANT TO BE UPPER CLASS 
SHE WANTS TO BE UPPER CLASS YOU 
GOING TO GET A BOWLER HAT WHAT DO 
YOU DO FOR A LIVING 
I AM JUST 
LOOKING FOR A JOB 
SO YOU ARE 
UNEMPLOYED MIDDLE CLASS MAN YES 
THE UNEMPLOYED MIDDLE CLASS THE 
WORLD REALLY IS CHANGING 
I AM UPPER CLASS AND I LOOK DOWN 
ON HIM 
I AM WORKING CLASS AND I 
LOOK UP TO HIM 
AND I AM THE MAN IN 
THE MIDDLE IN CARDIFF AND HORRIBLY 
CONFUSED HE MADE A HOPELESS 
WORKING CLASS BLOKE IT WAS DOWN TO 
THE HAT CAN YOU BE A WORKING CLASS 
SIR WHAT CLASS ARE YOU 
AM MIDDLE 
CLASS I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MIDDLE 
CLASS WHEN WE WERE DOING THAT SHOW 
WE FOUND A RICH MAN IN LONDON WHO 
WAS SO SNOBBISH HE WOULDN'T RIDE IN 
THE SAME CAR AS HIS CHAUFFEUR THAT THAT WAS GILES WASN'T IT 
AND ANOTHER 
ONE WHO IN FACT SAID TO HIS 
CHAUFFEUR DRIVE OVER A CLAIF JAMES 
I AM COMMITTING SUICIDE L. REMEMBER 
WHEN HAD JOHN PRESCOTT ON ONE 
PROGRAMME AND HE HAD SAID DURING 
THE BEAK BEFORE HE WAS NOW MIDDLE 
CLASS AND HIS FATHER WAS FURIOUS 
AND SAID I AM WORKING CLASS YOU 
ARE WORKING CLASS YOU WILL ALWAYS 
BE WORKING CLASS BUT JOHN PRESCOTT 
INSISTED THAT HE WAS NOW MIDDLE 
CLASS AND HE SAID I NO LONGER KEEP 
THE COAL IN THE BATH L. L. KEEP IT IN THE BEE DAY 
THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF MIDDLE 
CLASS WORKING CLASS CAN BECOME 
MIDDLE CLASS BUT YOU DON'T SEEM 
YOU CAN'T BE DOWNWARDLY MOBILE YOU 
CAN'T BECOME WORKING CLASS 
TONY JAY 
HAD A SET OF DEFINITION THAT WORKED 
WELL F. MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS WERE 
WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE FOR 
INSTANCE OR IF YOU GOT A WEEKLY 
WAGE YOU PROBABLY CALL YOURS 
WORKING CLASS IF YOU GOT A MONTHLY 
WAGE AND MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS WERE 
MILES AWAY THEN PERHAPS YOU WERE 
MIDDLE CLASS THERE IS LOTS OF 
THOSE JUDGMENTS AS IT WERE 
IT'S A 
PRIVILEGE TO INTERVIEW VIEW FOR 
MANY REASON NOT LEAST BECAUSE THE 
LIST OF PEOPLE THIS MAN HAS 
INTERVIEWED HAVE YOU SEEN IT WHAT 
DOES IT INCLUDE LET US HAVE A LOOK 
SEVEN PROSECUTES PRESIDENTS OF 
THE U. S. VLADIMIR PUTIN NELSON 
MANDELA PRINCESS DIANA THE DALAI 
LAMA ORSON WELLES THE LIST GOES 
ON MANY MORE HAVE LANDED ON PLANET 
FROST 
A GREAT JOY 
WHO WOULD YOU FROST LIKE TO INTERVIEW NEXT WILL IT BE 
BARACK OBAMA OR HILLARY 
I AM NOT 
SURE BUT I THINK OBAMA I GUESS 
THE RESULT ALSO COME IN SOON FROM 
PENNSYLVANIA BUT IT IS VERY UP IN 
THE AIR AND IS IT AN ADVANTAGE TO 
JOHN MCCAIN TO HAVE HAD THAT HEROIC 
EXPERIENCE OR WILL PEOPLE THINK 
GOD HE IS SEVENTY ONE I MUST HAVE HAD AN 
EFFECT ON HIM THESE ISSUES WILL BE 
DEBATED OVER THE NEXT 
WHO WOULD 
YOU TURN DOWN BIN LADEN 
I THINK 
YOU WOULD HAVE IT IT IS DIFFICULT 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO TURN DOWN BIN 
LADEN THAT IS WHERE JOURNALIST 
RESPONSIBILITIES CLASH WITH YOUR 
CITIZEN'S RESPONSIBILITIES WHAT 
YOU REALLY OUGHT TO DO IS DO A 
CITIZEN'S ARREST ON OSAMA BIN LADEN 
YOU WOULDN'T GET OUT OF THERE VERY 
EASILY AFTER TRYING TO DO THAT BUT 
I MEAN THAT IS WHAT YOU OUGHT TO 
TRY AND DO SO I THINK THERE CAN BE 
CLASHES LIKE THAT YOU KNOW YOU 
SHOULD I MEAN TO INTERVIEW BIN 
LADEN AND CO OPERATE IN NOT 
REVEALING WHERE HE IS TO THE 
AUTHORITIES YOU KNOW IS 
UNPATRIOTIC 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST UNPATRIOTIC INTERVIEWS WOULD BE THE FROST NIXON 
INTERROGATION AND IT HAS BEEN 
FICTIONALISED IN PLAY 
YES AND IT 
WAS FIRST OF ALL IT WAS A PLAY IN 
LONDON AND THEN I REMEMBER MICHAEL 
SHEEN WHO PLAYS ME IN THE FILM WAS 
ON THE PROGRAMME AND HE WAS SAYING 
THAT HE WAS GOING TO DO THE 
BROADWAY AND THEN HE WAS GOING TO 
DO THE FILM AND HE SAID TO ME DO 
YOU REALISE I AM GOING TO BE 
PLAYING DAVID FROST FOR THE NEXT 
YEAR AND I THAT'S A 
COINCIDENCE SO AM I 
I HOPE THE 
FILM IS GOOD 
I HAVE SEEN THE FIRST 
DRAFT OF IT AND IT REALLY IS 
LOOKING GOOD 
AS LONG AS YOU ARE 
HAPPY THE SPIRALLING COST OF FOOD 
CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE HEADLINE 
IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TODAY THAT THE 
AVERAGE FAMILY'S GROCERY BILL IS 
NOW EIGHT HUNDRED A YEAR MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS 
AGO THE TEMPTATION IS TO GO FOR 
CHEAPER IMPORTED FOOD IF YOU DO 
THAT ALL THE YEAR ROUND WITH APPLES 
AND CHRISTINE CATCHES YOU SHE WILL 
GIVE YOU A RIGHT PROPER TELLING OFF 
DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE OVER 
ONE THOUSAND VARIETIES OF ENGLISH APPLE 
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO 
EAT ONE EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR OVER 
THREE YEAR BEFORE YOU TRIED THEM 
ALL ALL BUT EVEN WITH SO MANY DELICIOUS 
ENGLISH APPLE VARIETIES AVAILABLE 
WE SEEM TO BE EATING MORE FOREIGN 
ONES ALL THE TIME THIS ONE HAS 
COME ALL THE WAY FROM CHINA 
BRITAIN'S ORCHARDS ARE IN CRISIS 
IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE LOST 
ALMOST SIXTY PER CENT OF THEM BUT AT THE SAME 
TIME WE ARE IMPORTING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
LORRIES OF APPLES FROM OVERSEAS 
EVERY YEAR 
IT IS APRIL NOW AND I CAN'T GET MY 
HANDS ON AN ENGLISH APPLE BECAUSE 
IT IS NOT THE SEASON BUT IF WE 
KEEP LOSING ORCHARDS I AM NEVER 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO EAT AN ENGLISH 
APPLE WHY ARE WE IN SUCH TROUBLE 
ONE OF THE REASONS IT SEEMS IS OUR 
YEAR ROUND DEMAND FOR FRUIT AND OUR 
ORCHARDS CAN'T COPE 
SO THESE ARE FROM SOUTH AFRICA AND 
FRANCE THAT IS NEAR TO HOME AND 
WHERE IS ROYAL GALA FROM BRAZIL 
ADRIAN BARLOW THINKS THE DECLINE IS 
ALSO DOWN TO CONSUMER TASTES THERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VARIETIES WE CAN'T 
GROW IN THE U. K. LIKIAN I GRANNY 
SMITH AND PINK LADY SO AGAIN THEY 
WOULD BE IMPORTED BUT DURING THE 
SUMMER AND ALSO DURING OUR OWN 
SEASON 
AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO SEASON CHANGE THAT SITUATION CONSUMERS CONSUMERS HAVE BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT GLOBAL 
WARMING AND AS A RESULT THAT IS 
GIVING AN ENORMOUS BOOST TO SALES 
OF LOCAL PRODUCTION AND THE DEMAND 
FOR LOCAL PRODUCTION 
SO MIGHT WE 
SEE MORE HERITAGE VARIETYS IN 
SUPERMARKETS 
WELL THERE IS A BIT SUPERMARKETS OF A PROBLEM WITH HERITAGE 
BECAUSE WHY 
THE REASON FOR IT BECAUSE WHY IS THAT LOT OF THESE HERITAGE 
VARIETIES ARE VERY INTERESTING IN 
TERMS OF HAVING GENES THAT NEED TO 
BE RETAINED BUT THEY AREN'T 
SUITABLE FOR THE MODERN CONSUMER 
MANY OF THEM HAVE A VERY ODD 
APPEARANCE AND PEOPLE WILL SIMPLY 
REJECT THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T LOOK 
AS THEY WOULD EXPECT THEM TO LOOK 
EVEN THOUGH MANY OF OUR HERITAGE 
APPLES COULD NOT BE SOLD IN 
SUPERMARKETS THE NATIONAL FRUIT 
COLLECTION AT BROGDALE GROWS THEM 
THEY ARE LIKE A GENE BANK 
PRESERVING OUR LIVING HISTORY THE 
APPLE IS TO ENGLAND WHAT CHEESE IS 
TO FRANCE EVERY REGION HAS ITS OWN 
APPLE VARIETY BUT HERE AT BROGDALE 
THEY GROW OVER SIX HUNDRED DIFFERENT 
BRITISH VARIETIES 
ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR TED HOBDAY HAS THE JOB OF 
PRESERVING THESE NATIONAL TREASURES 
WE ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THINGS 
LIKE COX AND BRAEBURN AND GOLDEN 
DELICIOUS BUT YOU HAVE OVER TWO THOUSAND 
TREES HERE WHAT ARE THE GOOD 
STORIES WHAT ARE THE RARITYS IN 
THIS COLLECTION 
TAKE THIS ONE A SCOTTISH APPLE 
WITH AN ODD NAME IT TAKES ITS NAME 
FROM AN INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED IN 
THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTIES A PLOUGHMAN SCRUMPING 
CAUGHT BY THE GAMEKEEPER WHO LET 
HIM HAVE BOTH BARRELS OF THE SHOT 
GUN AND THE ESTATE GAVE THE APPLES 
TO WIDOW SHE WAS DISGUSTED THREW 
THEM ON THE MIDDEN AND THEN A TREE 
GREW AND THEY NAMED IT AFTER A 
PLOUGHMAN 
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT WE PLOUGHMAN KEEP THESE VARIETIES ALIVE 
IT IS 
WORTH PRESERVING BECAUSE IT IS THE 
LIVING HISTORY OF BRITAIN IT IS 
THE FRUIT THAT HAS BEEN HERE FOR 
CENTURIES IF WE LOSE IT IT IS 
GONE AND WE CAN'T USE ITS FOR 
REPRODUCTION OR TASTING OR ANY 
OTHER REASON 
OUR HERITAGE APPLES 
ARE IN GOOD HANDS BUT OUR BRITISH 
ORCHARDS NEED SUPPORT AT END OF 
THE SUMMER WHEN THE BRITISH APPLE 
SEASON STARTS BUY THEM AND ENJOY 
THEM I'M A APPLE LOVER MYSELF YOU 
CAN'T GET BRITISH APPLE AT THIS 
TIME OF YEAR 
WELL GO FOR SOMETHING 
LIKE A COX A GOOD APPLE THAT HAS 
BEEN THERE FOR YEARS 
BUT THEY GET 
A BIT SOFT 
NOT IF THEY STORED 
PROPERLY STICK THEM IN THE FRIDGE 
THE QUEEN OF THE APPLE AROUND THE 
WORLD THAT IS THE ENVY OF THE 
BRITISH COUNTRY THE BRAMLEY YOU YOU HYPE KNOW TIEZING SIR DAVID 
I ONCE 
TAKE THAT ONE I ONCE HAD ON THE 
GUINNESS BOOK OF RECORDS SHOW I 
HAD A GUY CALLED FRANK FREER WHO 
CAREFULLY PEELED AND HE GOT A PEEL 
A CONTINUOUS PEEL THAT WAS FORTY THREE FEET 
LONG 
CHRISTINE WANTS TO MEET HIM LONG GO ON PICK AN APPLE AND HAVE GOOD 
CHOMP HAVE AN APPLE

COME ON MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL JUST JUST KEEP THE NOISE DOWN WHILE I TALK

WEMBLEY ON SATURDAY ONE OF THE 
BENEFICIARIES IS THE BOBBY MOORE 
CANCER FUND I'M ONE OF THE PATRONS 
I'M AN HONORARY MANAGER FOR ONE OF

GOOD ADVERTISEMENT 
THERE HAS BEEN 
A MEDICAL BREAK THROUGH T. BIONIC 
EYE TWO BLIND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
FITTED WITH THIS DEVICE IT AUR A 
AROUX LOUS THEM TO SEE IT 
ALLOWS THEM TO SEE MOVING ONS BUT BUT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE 
WITHOUT THIS BOOK 
GRAY'S ANATOMY 
THAT SURGEONS STILL USE 
IT IS A 
BIG BOOK FOR A TELEVISION SHOW WE WE WILL READ THE WHOLE THING OUT IT IT WAS PUBLISHED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO AND AS 
MICHAEL MOSELEY EXPLAINS WE SHOULD 
THANK OUR LUCKY STARS THAT IT WAS 
WHEN I WAS A MEDICAL STUDENT I 
STUDY ANATOMY AND LIKE THOUSANDS 
BEFORE ME I WOULD DIPNA OUT OF THIS 
BOOK GRAY'S ANATOMY DIP IN 
AND OUT OF THIS BOOK GRAY'S 
ANATOMY I HAVE COME TO FIND OUT 
MOFR ABOUT THE BOOK AND THE MAN WHO 
CREATED IT IT IS THE BEST KNOWN 
MEDICAL BOOK EVER FINDING A PLACE 
ON SHELVES AROUND THE WORLD GIRING 
ITS NAME EVEN 
TO T. V. SERIES AND TO CELEBRATE ITS ONE HUNDRED FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY 
THERE IS A CHANCE TO SEE SOME OF 
THE ORIGINAL ARTWORK FROM THE FIRST 
EDITION THE PROOFS ARE GORGEOUS 
YES 
WHY DID THIS BOOK BECOME SO YES SUCCESSFUL 
BECAUSE IT WAS BETTER SUCCESSFUL THAN ANYTHING ON THE MARKET AT THE 
TIME WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT IT WAS 
THE BEST THING AVAILABLE IT WAS A 
HIT T. LANCET AND THE BRITISH 
MEDICAL JOURNAL SAID IT WOULD BE 
THE MANUAL IT WILL SELL AND IT DID 
THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS WERE A BOOM TIME FOR 
SURGERY WITH THE DISCOVERY OF 
ANAESTHETIC SURGEONS COULD PERFORM 
OPERATIONS UNDREAMT OF BEFORE SO 
IT WAS IMPORTANT THEY KNEW WHAT 
THEY WERE DOING GRAY'S ANATOMY 
GAVE THEM UNPRECEDENTED DETAIL THE 
TEXT WRITTEN BY HENRY GREY WAS 
BASED ON EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF WORK BUT 
WHAT MADE IT SUCCESS WAS THE 
BEAUTIFUL PICTURES 
THE OLDER BOOKS 
HAD SMALLER PICTURES WITH THESE 
TINY NUMBERS AND LETTERS WHICH 
REFER TO FOOT NOTES IN GRAY'S 
ANATOMY THE ILLUSTRATIONS SHOW THE 
NAMES ON THE STRUCTURES SO YOU ARE 
READING AND LOOKING AT THE SAME 
TIME AND YOU GET THE NAME ON THE 
STRUCTURE IT IS AS A STRUCTURE AND 
A WORD 
IT SOUNDS OBVIOUS BUT 
PUTTING LABELS ON THE DIAGRAM WAS 
AT THE TIME A REVOLUTIONARY IDEA 
AND MADE STUDYING THE BODY SO MUCH 
EASIER FOR STUDENTS IT WAS A GOD 
SEND NAVIGATING THE INSIDES OF A 
REAL HUMAN BODY CAN BE A VERY 
TRICKY BUSINESS L. CAN REMEMBER THE 
FIRST TIME I DISSECTED A BODY MY 
IMPRESSION WAS OF MESS AND 
CONFUSION IT CAN BE HARD TO 
IDENTIFY WHAT ITS YOU LOOKING AT 
UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU ARE 
LOOKING AT GRAY'S ANATOMY GAVE 
STUDENTS FOR THE FIST TIME SIMPLE 
CLEAR WELL LABELLED MAPS OF THE 
BODY BUT THE ILLUSTRATIONS WHICH 
ARE WHAT MAKE THE BOOK WERE NOT 
ACTUALLY DONE BY HENRY GREY THE THE DRAWINGS WERE DOWN BY HENRY VAN 
DYKE CARTER HE WAS A SUBORDINATE 
TO HENRY GREY BUT IF YOU LOOK AT 
THE PICTURES YOU CAN SEE CARTER'S 
ILLUSTRATIONS ARE WHAT CARRIES IT 
DESPITE CARTER'S ROLE HE IS ALL 
BUT FORGOTTEN GREY GOT THE GLORY 
HFRPBLGTS WANTS TO BE 
HE WANTED 
TO BE A TOP CONSULTANT AND HE IS 
SING MINDED CARTER IS FROM THE 
PROVINCES FROM SCARBOROUGH HE IS 
NOT AN INVIEDER INSIDER AND HIS 
FATHER IS AN ARTIST AN INTERESTING 
FAMILY BUT NOT RICH 
IF THIS WAS A 
BEST SELLER OF THE TIME THIS WAS 
THE J. K. ROWLING OF THE TIME WHO GOT 
THE MONEY 
WELL THEY BOTH GOT PAID 
FOR THE WORK BUT GREY ENDED UP 
GETTING ROYALTYS FROM THE SALES 
CARTER IT WAS A ONE OF OFF FEE 
GREY NOT ONLY GOT PAYMENT HE GOT 
THE MONEY AS WELL 
YES A FORTUNE 
IT HAS TRAINED GENERATIONS OF 
DOCTORS AND IMMORTALISED HENRY GREY 
BUT IT IS GOOD TO REMEMBER THE OWN 
HENRY HENRY VAN DYKE CARTER THE THE CLASS ISSUE COMING INTO PLAY AGAIN 
THE EXHIBITION IS OPEN TO THE 
PUBLIC AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF 
SURGEONS LIBRARY UNTIL FRIDAY MAY 
SECOND 
YOU TAUGHT ONCE AT A SCHOOL SECOND WOULD THAT BE CORRECT YES SUSAN YES SUSAN FROM THE SCHOOL WAS ONE OF THE 
PUPILS YOU TAUGHT I WAS A PUPIL
