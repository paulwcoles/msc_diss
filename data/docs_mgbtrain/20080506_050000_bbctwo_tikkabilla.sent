YOU NEED RIDING LESSONS TAMBA 
I WAS JUST PRETENDING TO FALL OFF MY HORSE BEVERLEY 
DID YOU THINK I WAS REALLY FALLING OFF YES I REALLY DID 
DO YOU KNOW SOME CHILDREN LEARN HOW TO RIDE REAL HORSES 
BY STARTING TO RIDE ON HOBBY HORSES 
LIKE THIS ONE M. M. M. REALLY REALLY 
AND WE CAN SEE HOW THEY LEARN TO RIDE THEIR HOBBY HORSES 
AND HOW THEY MAKE THEM THROUGH THE 
WINDOWS 
HA HA OH CLIPPETY CLOP CLIPPETY CLOP 
CLIPPETY CLOP CLIPPETY CLOP 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE 
TWO 
THREE 
ROUND 
SQUARE 
OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE ROUND WINDOW 
THESE CHILDREN ARE HAVING THEIR FIRST RIDING LESSON 
AND FIRST THEY HAVE TO MAKE THEIR OWN HOBBY HORSES 
WHAT ARE THEY MAKING NOW 
THEY'RE MAKING REINS YOU NEED REINS TO HOLD ONTO YOUR HORSE 
WHAT ARE THE NAILS FOR BEVERLEY 
AHA YOU'LL SEE 
THE STRING NOW LOOKS LIKE A HORSE'S MANE 
ON GO THE EYES 
AND HER HORSE IS READY 
NOW THE CHILDREN ARE READY TO RIDE 
WHY DON'T THEY GET STRAIGHT ONTO REAL HORSES 
THE CHILDREN MUST LEARN HOW TO FOLLOW EACH OTHER PROPERLY 
AND THEY CAN LEARN HOW TO WALK TROT AND GALLOP 
WITHOUT FALLING OFF LIKE I DID BEFORE THAT'S RIGHT TAMBA 
THEY'RE NOT GOING VERY FAST ARE THEY 
NOT AT THE MOMENT NO 
OH WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW 
AH 
THEY'RE TROTTING 
NOW THOSE ARE GOING TO BE PRETEND FENCES 
WHAT ARE THEY FOR 
AH YOU WAIT AND SEE TAMBA 
OFF THEY GO 
AH THEY'RE LEARNING TO JUMP 
HA HA LOOKS LIKE FUN 
CLIPPETY CLOP JUMP 
CLIPPETY CLOP JUMP 
CLIPPETY CLOP JUMP 
OH THAT WAS A VERY GOOD JUMP WASN'T IT YEAH 
WELL DONE HORSEY 
I THINK THOSE CHILDREN WERE READY TO START RIDING REAL HORSES 
AFTER ALL THAT PRACTICE DON'T YOU 
NOW YOU CAN PRACTISE RIDING YOUR VERY OWN HOBBY HORSE 
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE ONE 
NOW I'VE GOT TWO PIECES OF CARD HERE 
I'M GOING TO GRAB A FRUIT CARTON 
AND I'M GOING TO DRAW AROUND THE FRUIT CARTON LIKE THIS 
PUT THE FRUIT CARTON TO THE EDGE OF YOUR PIECE OF CARD 
AND DRAW AROUND LIKE THAT 
THEN TURN THE FRUIT CARTON THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
AND DRAW AROUND IT AGAIN 
LIKE THAT 
THERE 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO CUT IT OUT 
WE TAKE OUT ANOTHER PIECE OF CARD 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CUT OUT BOTH PIECES OF CARD AT THE SAME TIME 
LET'S GET OUR SCISSORS 
BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE CUTTING THINGS OUT 
ESPECIALLY WITH CARD AND IT'S A BIT TOUGH SOMETIMES THERE WE GO 
CUT ALL THE WAY AROUND 
THE BLACK LINES 
AND WHAT WE'RE DOING 
IS WE'RE CUTTING OUT 
THE HORSE'S HEAD THERE WE GO 
NEARLY THERE 
AND FINISHED 
NOW DON'T THROW AWAY THIS CARD 
WE'RE GOING TO NEED IT IN A MINUTE 
IT DOESN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE A HORSE'S HEAD AT THE MOMENT 
IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG RED FLUFFY SOCK HOPE IT'S NOT SMELLY 
POOH 
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T WANT TO SEE OUR BLACK LINES 
SO IF WE TURN OUR CARD AROUND THAT WAY 
WE CAN HIDE THEM AND COVER THEM UP 
NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO 
IS GLUE THE TWO PIECES OF CARD 
TOGETHER 
SO GET YOUR GLUE 
AND THEN ALL THE WAY ROUND THE EDGE OF THE CARD 
GLUE 
LIKE THIS 
BUT LEAVE A LITTLE BIT AT THE BOTTOM 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE HORSE'S BODY IS GOING TO GO 
THERE RIGHT SO STICK THAT DOWN LIKE THAT 
THAT STUCK YEAH GREAT 
NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO 
IS WE'RE GOING TO USE SOME OF THE CARD FROM EARLIER ON 
FOR THE HORSE'S EARS 
AND IF WE PUT THEM TOGETHER AGAIN LIKE WE DID WITH THE HORSE'S HEAD 
WE'RE GOING TO CUT A TRIANGLE 
LIKE THAT 
AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE THE EARS 
RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO POP THEM UP THERE 
AT THE TOP OF THE HEAD 
GLUE THEM DOWN 
ONE THERE 
THEN TURN THE HEAD AROUND 
AND GLUE THE OTHER ONE 
LIKE THAT 
TO FINISH THE EARS OFF 
I'VE GOT A PIECE OF FELT AND CUT A COUPLE OF TRIANGLES OUT 
SMALLER ONES THIS TIME 
I'VE USED A PINK COLOUR FOR THE INSIDE OF THE HORSE'S EAR 
LIKE THAT 
THERE TURN IT AROUND 
AND DO THE OTHER SIDE 
LOTS OF GLUE NEEDED FOR THE HORSE'S HEAD 
AS YOU CAN SEE 
RIGHT WE NEED TO HAVE SOME EYES AND A MOUTH DON'T WE 
TO MAKE OUR HORSE SMILE 
HE'S GOING TO BE A BIG SMILEY HORSE THIS ONE SO TAKE A PEN 
AND DRAW A BIG MOUTH IN LIKE THAT 
LOVELY SMILEY FACE 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO AN EYE 
WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED I KNOW 
A NOSE 
THERE 
TO FINISH THE EYE OFF YOU CAN USE SOME STICKERS 
I'M GOING TO USE SOME BLUE STICKERS 
POP ONE THERE 
THEN JUST DRAW ANOTHER LITTLE EYE IN THE MIDDLE 
THERE 
HOW'S THAT 
AND THEN DO EXACTLY THE SAME ON THE OTHER SIDE 
RIGHT BIG SMILEY FACE 
OUR EYE 
AND THE NOSE 
FINISH THE EYE OFF WITH ANOTHER STICKER 
AND A LITTLE DOT 
LIKE THAT 
THERE IT'S LOOKING GOOD ISN'T IT 
BUT IT IS MISSING SOMETHING 
HORSES HAVE LOTS OF HAIR DON'T THEY 
SO FOR OUR HAIR 
I THOUGHT WE'D USE SOME TISSUE PAPER 
NOW THE HORSE'S HAIR IS CALLED A MANE 
AND IT GOES DOWN THE BACK OF THE NECK 
SO IF WE PUT SOME MORE GLUE ON THE NECK LIKE THAT 
AND WE STICK THE TISSUE PAPER DOWN 
BOTH SIDES AGAIN 
LIKE THAT 
THERE 
AND TO FINISH IT OFF 
IF YOU GET A PAIR OF SCISSORS 
YOU CAN SNIP THE ENDS 
OF THE TISSUE PAPER ALL THE WAY DOWN 
LOOK IT MAKES A LOVELY RUFFLY HAIR EFFECT 
FOR THE HORSE'S MANE 
THERE WE GO 
NEARLY THERE 
THERE 
WOW IT'S NEARLY FINISHED 
ALL WE NEED NOW IS A BODY 
AND FOR THE BODY YOU CAN USE A STICK OR IF YOU CAN BORROW ONE 
A BROOM IS EVEN BETTER 
SO IF I HOLD THE BROOM BETWEEN MY KNEES LIKE THAT 
AND THEN WHERE WE LEFT A LITTLE GAP THERE AND WE DIDN'T GLUE IT 
I'M JUST GOING TO POP THE HORSE'S HEAD ONTO THE TOP OF THE BROOM 
LIKE THAT 
AND THEN GET SOME STICKY TAPE 
AND STICK THE HORSE'S HEAD ONTO THE BROOM 
ONE MORE PIECE FOR THE OTHER SIDE I THINK 
THERE 
ONE HOBBY HORSE 
NEIGH WHOA THERE 
OH JUSTIN WHAT A WONDERFUL RED HORSE YEAH 
SO HAPPY WHAT'S THE HORSE'S NAME 
WELL I THINK I'M GOING TO CALL HIM ALAN HELLO ALAN I'M BEVERLEY 
HELLO 
THERE ARE SOME MORE RED CREATURES THROUGH ONE OF THE WINDOWS 
SHALL WE GO OVER AND SEE WHICH WINDOW IT IS ALAN YES 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE 
TWO 
THREE 
ROUND 
SQUARE 
OR ARCHED 
H. M. M. 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK ALAN 
IT'S THE SQUARE WINDOW 
IF YOU LOOK REALLY CLOSELY IN THESE BUSHES 
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE A RED ANIMAL 
LOOK THERE'S A RED TAIL AND SOME RED FUR 
I WONDER WHAT IT IS 
IT'S A RED PANDA 
THIS RED PANDA'S FACE IS MAINLY WHITE BUT ITS BODY IS RED 
AND IT HAS A LONG STRIPY TAIL 
YOU MAY NOT HAVE SEEN A RED PANDA BEFORE 
BUT YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN BLACK AND WHITE ONES 
THEY ARE MUCH BIGGER SO THEY ARE CALLED GIANT PANDAS 
RED PANDAS LIKE TO CLIMB AROUND IN TREES 
AND LIVE IN FORESTS IN THE WILD 
THEY'RE MUCH SMALLER THAN GIANT PANDAS 
WHICH ARE ACTUALLY BIG BEARS 
THESE RED PANDAS ARE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS A CAT 
THEY LIKE TO EAT BAMBOO JUST LIKE GIANT PANDAS 
BUT THEY ALSO EAT OTHER THINGS AS WELL LIKE FRUIT 
AND THEY SOMETIMES EAT MEAT TOO 
BUT BAMBOO IS THEIR FAVOURITE 
AND THEY EAT LOTS AND LOTS OF BAMBOO LEAVES EVERY DAY 
YOU MAY NOT HAVE SEEN A RED PANDA BEFORE 
BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF RED ANIMALS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN 
THERE ARE RED DEER WHICH ROAM AROUND IN WOODS AND FORESTS 
THERE ARE RED FOXES THAT SOMETIMES COME RIGHT INTO YOUR GARDEN 
THESE ARE RED SQUIRRELS 
RED SQUIRRELS ARE QUITE RARE 
SO YOU MAY HAVE ONLY SEEN GREY ONES BEFORE 
BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN A ROBIN REDBREAST 
YOU SEE THEM IN GARDENS EVERYWHERE 
LOOKS LIKE THE RED PANDA IS FULL UP AFTER ALL THAT BAMBOO 
TIME FOR AN AFTERNOON NAP 
NATURE THE WORLD AROUND US IS FULL OF RED THINGS 
ANIMALS LIKE THE RED SQUIRREL AND THE RED PANDA 
AND SOME FRUITS ARE RED AS WELL 
CAN YOU THINK OF A FRUIT THAT'S RED 
H. M. M. 
WHAT ABOUT THIS 
M. M. M. 
IT'S ROUND AND JUICY NICE AND SWEET 
M. M. M. IT'S AN APPLE 
SOME APPLES ARE RED 
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY OTHER FRUIT THAT'S RED 
SOMETHING SMALLER THAN AN APPLE 
AND REALLY DELICIOUS 
IT'S A. 
STRAWBERRY 
THERE'S SOME RED IN THE TIKKABILLA HOUSE 
AND THERE'S SOME RED LETTERS ON THE LETTER BOARD 
ONE 
TWO 
THREE RED LETTERS 
AND THE LETTERS ARE ALL THE SAME 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE LETTER IS 
IT'S THE LETTER R. 
WHICH SOMETIMES SOUNDS LIKE RUH 
THE WORD RED BEGINS WITH THE SOUND RUH 
NOW I CAN THINK OF THREE THINGS YOU CAN DO 
THAT BEGIN WITH THE SOUND RUH 
CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT TAMBA AND THE CHILDREN WERE DOING EARLIER ON 
H. M. M.
