BORIS JOHNSON STARTS WORK AS THE 
NEW MAYOR OF LONDON AFTER DEFEATING 
KEN LIVINGSTONE 
AS HE OFFICIALLY SIGNS FOR THE JOB 
HE PLEDGES TO LEAD THE FIGHT 
AGAINST CRIME AND PROMOTE UNITY IT IT IS VITAL FOR A MAYOR OF LONDON TO 
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND TO UNITE 
LONDON AND TO SERVE EVERY 
COMMUNITY IN LONDON IMPARTIALLY 
AFTER EIGHT YEARS IN THE JOB KEN 
LIVINGSTONE JOINS THE CASUALTIES OF 
LABOUR'S ELECTION DRUBBING RIGHT RIGHT NOW I'M COMING IN PACK MY DESK AND 
GO GO THE MCCANNS ATTEND SERVICE TO 
REMEMBER MADELINE A YEAR TO THE 
DAY SINCE SHE VANISHED IN PORTUGAL 
AND MANCHESTER MAGIC AS UNITED 
MOVE GIANT STEP CLOSER TO THE PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE 
GOOD AFTERNOON LABOUR IS INSISTING 
IT CAN WIN FOURTH TERM IN 
GOVERNMENT DESPITE ITS DRUBBING IN 
THE LOCAL ELECTIONS MINISTERS SAY 
THEY WILL LISTEN TO VOTERS' 
CONCERNS AFTER A STRING OF DEFEAT 
CULMINATING FOR A VICTORY FOR BORIS 
JOHNSON IN THE RACE FOR LONDON 
MAYOR THE LONDON RESULT CAME AFTER 
TORY GAINS ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
I NOW FORMALLY PRESENT THE NEW 
MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON 
NOT THE MOST SURE FOOTED OF 
ENTRANCE BUT BORIS JOHNSON NOW HAS 
A JOB AS BRAND AS HIS NAME THE 
MAYOR ELECT STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE 
TODAY TAKING LONDON FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES AFTER EIGHT YEARS 
OFFICIALLY HE'S IN CONTROL FROM 
MIDNIGHT TONIGHT 
UNTIL THAT TIME I 
IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE SHREDDING 
MACHINES QUIETLY PUFFING AND 
PANTING AWAY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF 
THE BUILDING QUITE RIGHT TOO HE HE WON'T HAVE MUCH TIME FOR JOKES IN 
CHARGE OF HOUSING TRANSPORT AND 
POLICING THE CAPITAL 
I THINK THERE 
IS A VITAL NECESSITY TO DRIVE OUT 
SO CALLED MINOR CRIME AND DISORDER 
AS WAY OF DRIVING OUT MORE SERIOUS 
CRIME I DO THINK IT IS TIME THAT 
WE LED THE FIGHT BACK AGAINST THESE 
DREADFUL SECURING THAT IS REALLY 
THE TIP OF AN SCOURGE 
THEN IT WAS STRAIGHT DOWN TO 
BRIEFINGS WITH THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
AND LONDON TRANSPORT NETWORK CHIEF 
KEN LIVINGSTONE STILL WENT TO WORK 
AT CITY HALL TODAY ALL HE HAD TO 
DO WAS CLEAR HIS OFFICE 
JUST PACK 
MY DESK AND GO 
WHO COULD BLAME THE 
PRIME MINISTER FOR HURRYING FROM 
LONDON LAST NIGHT WITH DEFEAT AND 
DRASTIC LOSSES LABOUR CAN'T ESCAPE 
HOW BAD THIS HAS BEEN 
THIS HASN'T 
BEEN A COMFORTABLE COUPLE OF DAYS 
NOR SHOULD IT BE THAT IS WHAT THE 
BRITISH PEOPLE WERE SAYING TO US 
WE NEED 
A KICK 
UP THE BACK SIDE 
THEY ARE 
FEELING 
THE PINCH 
AND 
WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE 
ARE GOING 
TO 
DO TO SUPPORT THROUGH TOUGH TIMES 
THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE MUCH TO 
CELEBRATE THEIR GAINS AS GOOD AS 
TONY BLAIR JUST BEFORE HE TOOK 
DOWNING 
STREET NO 
DOUBT DAVID 
CAMERON HAS MOVED CLOSER 
TO POWER 
WITH 
THAT WILL 
COME SCRUTINY LIKE 
NEVER BEFORE 
AFTER LOSING LONDON AFTER LOSING 
HUNDREDS OF COUNCILLORS HOW DOES 
GORDON BROWN RECOVER FROM THIS DO 
YOU THINK 
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER 
THESE ARE LOCAL ELECTION PEOPLE 
DON'T ALWAYS 
GO ON TO VOTE THE SAME 
WAY AT A GENERAL THAT SAID THE 
RESULTS WERE VERY POOR WORSE THAN 
LABOUR'S OWN WORST CASE SCENARIO 
GORDON BROWN'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN TO 
SAY HE DIDN'T LISTEN ENOUGH HE 
NEEDS TO LISTEN MORE TO PEOPLE'S 
WORRIES 
PARTICULARLY ABOUT 
ECONOMY BUT THERE 
ARE SOME 
PEOPLE 
IN 
THE LABOUR 
PARTY 
WHO FEAR 
JUST 
WON'T BE 
ENOUGH THAT HE HAS 
TO DO 
MORE HE 
HAS TO 
FIND 
SOMETHING NEW AND POSITIVE TO SAY 
TO PEOPLE RATHER THAN JUST TO APOLOGISE FOR 
NOT HAVING 
DONE 
ENOUGH SO FAR IT WON'T BE EASY 
THERE ARE POSSIBLE COMMONS DEFEATS 
KUSMING UP POTENTIALLY DIFFICULT 
TIMES AT WESTMINSTER AND ON TOP OF 
THAT 
THERE IS 
A TRICKY BY ELECTION

FEW WEEKS 
TIME GORDON 
BROWN HAS 
DECIDED 
TO COME 
OUT AND 
DO A ROUND OF INTERVIEWS WE WILL HEAR 
MORE FROM 
HIM 
ABOUT HOW HE PLANS TO TURN THINGS 
AROUND I THINK THERE ARE FEW 
PEOPLE WHO WOULD ENVY HIM THE TASK
