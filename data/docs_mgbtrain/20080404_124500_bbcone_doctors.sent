WHERE WILL YOU STAY IN BOSTON 
ANNIE WILL LOOK INTO APARTMENTS FOR ME

SOMEWHERE WHERE SHE CAN JUST COME TO TERMS WITH EVERYTHING 
WHAT ABOUT THE MILL I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT THAT FAR

YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT SUPPORT 
SEE I SAID I COULD PAY YOU 
I WORK HERE AFTER SCHOOL BEEN SAVING UP 
ARE YOU SIXTEEN YET BRADLEY NO 
WELL IF YOU WANT ME TO REPRESENT YOU 
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH YOUR MUM FIRST 
BUT TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT A SOLICITOR FOR FIRST 
IT'S THAT WHOLE THING I'M GONNA BE SIXTEEN NEXT YEAR 
AND I'M GONNA GET MY NATIONAL INSURANCE CARD AND THEY'LL PUT ME DOWN AS BRADLEY FINCH YEAH 
BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE A FINCH 
HE'S JUST SOME BLOKE WHO MARRIED TO MY MUM THEN WALKED OUT 
YOU STILL DON'T HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH YOUR FATHER 
NOT SINCE I WAS FIVE NO BIRTHDAY CARDS NOTHING 
MITCH IS LIKE MY PROPER DAD THAT'S YOUR STEP FATHER 
YEAH HE'S DONE EVERYTHING FOR ME 
IT WAS HIM THAT SORTED ME OUT AFTER ALL THAT TROUBLE 
I WANT TO BE CALLED BY HIS NAME 
O. K. WELL WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS CHANGING YOUR NAME BY DEED POLL 
IT'S VERY SIMPLE YOU CAN EVEN APPLY ON THE INTERNET 
BUT IF YOU WANT IT DONE BEFORE YOU'RE SIXTEEN 
THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO GET YOUR MUM TO DO IT 
SO YOU NEED TO SEE HER THEN WELL I CAN BUT YOU DON'T REALLY NEED A SOLICITOR 
ALL THE FORM NEEDS IS THE CONSENT OF BOTH PARENTS 
MY REAL DAD DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ME 
HE STILL HAS PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY 
IF YOU CAN TRACE HIM THEN YOU HAVE TO GET HIS PERMISSION 
BUT IF YOU CAN'T THEN THERE ARE WAYS AROUND IT 
RIGHT I'LL TELL MUM 
SO YOU WON'T WANT ANY OF THIS THEN 
HEY BACK FROM THE NAUGHTY CORNER

MRS. WILKINS TANYA PLEASE 
THANKS FOR COMING SO SOON HEY 
HELLO MR. WOODSON YEAH GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
THIS ISN'T ABOUT BRADLEY IS IT

OH YES BYE BYE 
CONTRACTS YEAH 
ER WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME INSIDE 
JUST GO THROUGH TO THE SITTING ROOM 
IT'S SO NICE OF YOU TO COME TO THE HOUSE 
NO NOT AT ALL 
WELL TO BE HONEST I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT BRAD CHANGING HIS NAME 
I MEAN HIS FATHER IS HIS FATHER WHEREVER HE IS 
WHAT BRADLEY WANTS ISN'T UNCOMMON 
KIDS CAN BE SENSITIVE ABOUT HAVING A DIFFERENT NAME TO THEIR PARENTS 
I DUNNO IT SEEMS LIKE SO MUCH TROUBLE 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE 
YES YOU HAVE TO APPLY TO THE COURT ON HIS BEHALF 
AND IT NEEDS CONSENT OF ALL THOSE WITH PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY 
IF HE WAITS TILL HE'S SIXTEEN HE DOESN'T NEED ANYONE'S PERMISSION 
NO I TAKE YOUR POINT 
BUT BRADLEY JUST FEELS THAT SIXTEEN IS SOMETHING OF A MILESTONE 
AND HE'D LIKE HIS NEW NAME BY THEN 
YEAH WELL MAYBE HE JUST CAN'T 
LOOK IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE A BIG THING 
IF YOU'VE LOST CONTACT WITH BRADLEY'S FATHER YOU CAN WRITE A LETTER SAYING THAT 
WHAT SORT OF A LETTER A LETTER TO THE COURT 
I COULD DO IT FOR YOU BUT IT ONLY NEEDS TO BE SIMPLE 
YOU JUST SAY YOU'VE MADE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO FIND YOUR HUSBAND 
WRITTEN TO HIS LAST ADDRESS RELATIVES 
WHICH I PRESUME YOU DID ANYWAY WHEN HE FIRST LEFT 
DIDN'T YOU TRY TO GET CHILD SUPPORT 
NO NO 
THERE'S NO POINT IN LOOKING FOR HIM 
O. K. EVERYBODY LISTEN THANKS FOR WAITING 
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT JOE WILL BE LEAVING US 
EMILY IS ILL AND HE'S GOING WITH HER TO BOSTON

SORRY IT'S ALL RIGHT GO AHEAD 
BRADLEY I GOT THEM TO CALL YOU 
IT'S THEFT THIS TIME SHOPLIFTING BOOZE THE STUPID SOD 
ARE YOU O. K. YOU WON'T GET ANY SENSE OUT OF HIM 
THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP HIM IN THE CELLS TILL HE SOBERS UP 
HONESTLY MR. WOODSON WE WERE DONE WITH ALL THIS 
HE'S DOING ALL RIGHT AT SCHOOL HE'S GOT A JOB 
HAVE YOU TOLD MITCH WHY YOU WERE DRINKING 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE'S NO EXCUSE 
I'M NOT SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T TELL YOUR MUM BECAUSE SHE'D BE GUTTED TO SEE YOU HERE 
BRADLEY 
YOU TELL HIM 
CAN YOU STEP OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE 
GEORGE COME IN 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE LEAVING 
IT'S DANIEL I'M WORRIED ABOUT 
IT'S HITTING HIM HARD I'M SURE IT IS 
HE'S A GOOD DOCTOR GEORGE HE SHOWS GREAT POTENTIAL 
IF ONLY HE HAD THE MATURITY TO MANAGE HIMSELF H. M. M. 
I'M WORRIED THAT THIS FIGHT WITH ARCHIE IS GOING TO TURN INTO ANOTHER BLACK CLOUD 
HE WAS EMOTIONAL UPSET HE'S PROMISED ME IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN 
GOOD WHAT WILL HELP IS IF YOU SHOW CONFIDENCE IN HIM 
WITH ME NOT HERE HE'S GOING TO NEED THAT 
DON'T BEND OVER BACKWARDS BUT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE CARES 
I'LL DO MY BEST THANKS GEORGE 
THAT'S A GREAT WEIGHT OFF MY MIND 
SHE WOULD HAVE HATED ALL THAT 
PRISON VISITING 
BEING SEARCHED BY GUARDS 
SITTING ACROSS A TABLE 
SHE LIKES HER LIFE TO BE JUST RIGHT 
I THINK SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE EFFECT ON BRADLEY 
IT WASN'T JUST HER DECISION THOUGH WAS IT 
HE SHOULD HAVE KEPT SEEING HIS DAD 
WELL AT LEAST HE HAD YOU 
HE'S A GOOD BOY 
MY MATES WARNED ME ABOUT GETTING INVOLVED WITH A WOMAN WITH A KID 
BUT I JUST CLICKED WITH HIM STRAIGHT AWAY 
DID YOU AND TANYA TALK ABOUT BRADLEY'S FATHER 
I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT 
WHAT SORT OF MAN COULD WALK OUT ON HIS WIFE AND CHILD 
AND TANYA SHE NEVER COMPLAINED ABOUT MAINTENANCE OR NOTHING 
I THOUGHT SHE HAD SUCH DIGNITY 
SHE MUST HAVE CONTACTED HIM FOR THE DIVORCE 
SHE GOT IT FOR DESERTION 
WHEN DID YOU MARRY A YEAR AFTER WE MET 
SO ED WOULD HAVE BEEN INSIDE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS 
IF YOU SAY SO 
WHAT DOES IT MATTER ANYWAY 
HI THERE I'VE JUST COME FROM THE POLICE STATION 
YOU KNOW BRADLEY'S BEEN ARRESTED 
MITCH PHONED AND TOLD ME IS HE ALL RIGHT 
WELL HE'S SOBERING UP THEN HE'LL BE INTERVIEWED 
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL MITCH THAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS IN PRISON 
I HADN'T SEEN HIM FOR MONTHS 
WHEN MITCH CAME ALONG IT WAS LIKE A FRESH START 
SO DID YOUR HUSBAND GIVE HIS CONSENT TO A DIVORCE CONSENT 
DID YOU GO AND SEE HIM OR WRITE HIM A LETTER 
WELL I CAN'T REMEMBER 
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER IF HE GAVE HIS CONSENT 
IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE WE WERE STILL MARRIED BUT YOU WERE TANYA 
BEING IN PRISON ISN'T THE SAME AS DESERTION 
ED IS STILL YOUR HUSBAND UNLESS YOU DIVORCED HIM PROPERLY 
YOU'VE COMMITTED BIGAMY 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 
YOUR MARRIAGE TO MITCH IS ILLEGAL 
I'LL DIVORCE ED THEN I'LL DO IT RIGHT THIS TIME 
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT MAKING A FALSE DECLARATION TO MARRY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE 
YOU'VE DECEIVED MITCH DELIBERATELY 
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT 
I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE WOULD FIND OUT 
THEY HAVE I DON'T KNOW HOW MITCH WILL TAKE IT 
BUT BRADLEY DOESN'T WANT TO SEE YOU 
WE'RE A HAPPY FAMILY THE THREE OF US 
TO BRADLEY HIS FAMILY MEANT TRUST AND SECURITY 
SO MUCH SO HE WANTED TO TAKE MITCH'S NAME 
NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM THAT WAS ALL BASED ON A LIE 
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THINGS QUITE A LOT 
VIVIEN I'M OFF FOR MY APPOINTMENT IT'S NOT IN THE BOOK 
I TOLD YOU VIVIEN IT'S PERSONAL 
OH YES I'M SO SORRY 
MY MIND'S ON THESE AIRLINE BOOKINGS 
RIGHT I WILL BE BACK BEFORE CLOSING MAKE YOU SURE YOU ARE 
I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE HERE BY THE END OF THE DAY 
HELLO THIS IS EMILY FENTON 
YOU DO REMEMBER 
MITCH DON'T 
I'M SORRY 
YOU LIED TO ME TANYA FROM THE FIRST DAY WE MET 
I DIDN'T 
I WASN'T THINKING ABOUT ED 
ALL THEM YEARS WE SPENT TOGETHER THAT WASN'T A LIE 
SO OUR WEDDING WAS REAL 
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS EVER ARE WE MARRIED 
MITCH I LOVE YOU I MEANT EVERY ONE OF THEM VOWS 
YOU'VE MADE A PROPER MUG OUT OF ME 
LOOK I'M GOING TO TELL THE POLICE 
MR. WOODSON SAYS IF I HAND MYSELF IN IT'LL GO BETTER FOR ME 
I'VE GOT TO GO MITCH 
DON'T LET THIS DESTROY US LOOK I KNOW WHAT I'VE DONE IS REALLY BAD 
BUT YOU LOVE ME I KNOW YOU DO 
IF YOU LEAVE IT'S GOING TO PUNISH BOTH OF US 
MITCH HAS GONE 
SO I CAN'T BE INTERVIEWED THEN YOUR MUM'S HERE 
I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER BRADLEY 
I TRUSTED HER TOTALLY 
I DIDN'T HAVE A REAL DAD BUT I KNEW SHE'D NEVER LET ME DOWN 
SHE DIDN'T INTEND TO HURT YOU 
ARE YOU DEFENDING HER NO I'M JUST SAYING SHE IS STILL YOUR MUM 
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HATE HER BUT IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT 
YOU'RE LATE SORRY 
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T COMING 
SO WHAT ARE WE DISCUSSING TODAY 
ER BETRAYAL OH 
I ERM I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH 
YOU DON'T I'VE NEVER BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO YOU 
YOU WENT BEHIND MY BACK WITH ANOTHER WOMAN WHEN I WAS PREGNANT 
O. K. SO YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO TRUST SOMEONE IMPLICITLY AND HAVE THAT BROKEN 
THE DIFFERENCE IS I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING I'M ASHAMED OF 
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF DEGREES 
NO IT'S ABOUT CROSSING A LINE 
I ALWAYS KNEW WHAT I COULD STAND TO LOSE 
YOU SEE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT NOW 
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN 
I WAS BETTER WITH YOU THAN ON MY OWN FACT 
FOR SO LONG A CONSTANT A GIVEN 
AND IF I'D JEOPARDISED THAT 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE CUTTING OFF AN ARM 
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE DONE 
I KEEP TELLING YOU THAT WHAT HAPPENED WITH NICK MEANT NOTHING 
THAT JUST MAKES IT WORSE 
THAT YOU HAD SEX WITH HIM OUT OF GUILT OR PITY OR WHATEVER IT WAS 
YOU COULD PUT OUR MARRIAGE AT RISK WITH SO LITTLE THOUGHT 
I'M SORRY 
I LOVE YOU 
BUT I DON'T TRUST YOU 
STILL HERE MUM'S TALKING TO THE POLICE 
SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO 
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT A LIFT HOME 
ARE YOU SURE I MEAN I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU'D BE BACK 
WHATEVER HAPPENS BETWEEN ME AND YOUR MAM 
YOU KNOW THAT 
I THOUGHT THAT WENT WELL 
I'M SURE WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS 
WHO KNOWS MAYBE WE'LL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE STRONGER FOR IT
