TWO WEEKS AT MAGIC SCHOOL 
THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE WINNER 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE 
ON TODAY'S SHOW THE SORCEREES LEARN SOME MAGICAL MOVES 
FOUR FIVE 
HEAR FROM HOME I MISS MY FAMILY BUT I'M O. K. I'LL STICK THROUGH IT 
AND TACKLE THEIR TOUGHEST TRICKS YET I'M SCARED WHAT LIKE THAT 
GASPS 
DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE ANCIENT ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
A MASTER MAGICIAN IS SEARCHING FOR AN APPRENTICE 
A BOY OR GIRL WHO CAN MASTER THE SECRETS 
THE ART AND HISTORY OF MAGIC 
A PROTEGE TO MAKE THE LIGHT OF MAGIC SHINE ETERNAL 
THE KIND OF APPRENTICE I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY THAT IS DEDICATED 
SOMEBODY THAT SEEKS TO BE SKILFUL 
SOMEBODY THAT AIMS FOR PERFECTION 
OUR SORCEREES HAVE EXPERIENCED A NON STOP BARRAGE OF MAGIC 
MM THAT HURTS ME OOH OOH 
EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE CARROT IT TRANSMOGRIFIES 
BUT HAS ANY OF IT RUBBED OFF 
HERE WE ARE A MOUSE 
CHICK CHICK CHICK CHICK CHICKEN LAY AN EGG FOR ME IT'S A REAL EGG 
THE CONTEST TO BE THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE IS VERY INTENSE 
THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL BECAUSE IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS 
THE FIRST FOUR WILL BE ELIMINATED 
I JUST WANT TO DO MY BEST AND STAY IN THE ACADEMY 
HOPEFULLY I WON'T GO HOME A GIRL WILL BE THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE 
IT'S ALMOST THE END OF THE FIRST WEEK 
AND HOUSEMISTRESS MISS FORD IS UP BRIGHT AND EARLY 
GOOD MORNING TIME TO GET UP 
THE BOYS ARE COMPLETE SLEEPYHEADS 
BUT IN THE GIRLS' DORM IT'S PRACTISE PRACTISE PRACTISE 
O. K. LADIES WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON OUR MEMORIES AND OUR CARD SKILLS 
THEY'RE DETERMINED TO STAY AHEAD OF THE GAME 
ONE TWO THREE TWO OF CLUBS QUEEN OF CLUBS AND FIVE OF HEARTS GOOD 
TOMORROW WILL BE THE LAST TIME THE BOYS AND GIRLS COMPETE IN TEAMS 
BUT WITH THE GIRLS LEADING TWO NIL THE BOYS' HONOUR IS AT STAKE 
THE COMPETITION IS REALLY HOTTING UP 
SO OUR TRAINEE MAGICIANS REALLY NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON WHAT OW 
OW SO AS I WAS SAYING CONCENTRATION IS KEY 
THE ABILITY TO PASS THROUGH SOLID OBJECTS MAY ALSO BE A GOOD THING 
COME ON IN LADIES TAKE YOUR SEATS 
TODAY THEY MUST LEARN THE MYSTERIES OF RESTORATION AND PENETRATION 
MR. KNIGHT IS TEACHING THE ART OF RESTORATION TEARING UP AN OBJECT 
THEN PUTTING IT BACK TOGETHER 
IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY RECENTLY I GOT GIVEN A PRESENT 
AND WHEN I OPENED THE PRESENT IT WAS A MAGIC WAND 
FIRST YOU TAKE SOME TISSUE PAPER AND A WAND 
NOW THE MAGIC WAND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THEY CAN DO 
THIS WAND WAS GIVEN TO ME BY MY BEST FRIEND 
THEN YOU TEAR THE PAPER INTO PIECES AND SCREW IT UP INTO A BALL 
IF I TAP THIS ONCE TWICE THRICE HOPEFULLY IF THIS HAS WORKED 
THIS SHOULD'VE ACTUALLY FUSED A PIECE OF PAPER BACK INTO 
ITS ORIGINAL FORM 
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LEARN IT'S FAIRLY EASY TO DO 
MM EASIER SAID THAN DONE 
AS THAT'S STUCK TO THE BACK THE WHOLE THING REMAINS AS ONE PIECE 
IF THAT MAKES SENSE NO WE'LL DO IT AGAIN 
SO THE IDEA IS TO KEEP THAT OTHER BALL A SECRET 
SO YOUR AUDIENCE NEVER KNOWS YOU'VE GOT PAPER HIDDEN IN YOUR HAND O. K. 
WHY IS IT ALWAYS RED BECAUSE RED'S A NICE BRIGHT COLOUR SO'S YELLOW 
THIS IS TRUE BUT RED'S MORE MANLY 
THE GIRLS ARE MASTERING PENETRATION 
PASSING ONE OBJECT THROUGH ANOTHER 
THIS IS A TRICK WITH TWO BALLOONS TWO EGGS YOU'LL TAKE ONE EGG 
IT GOES INSIDE THE BALLOON 
WOW 
SECOND TIME WITH A CLEAR BALLOON SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING 
WE TAKE THE EGG 
WOW WE NOW HAVE AN EGG IN A BALLOON 
SOME OF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S AN EGG INSIDE THE BLACK BALLOON 
SO HERE WE GO THERE IT IS 
AN EGG 
THANK YOU 
SO WHAT'S THE SECRET OF THE TRICK 
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU PINCH THAT LIKE SO 
I GRAB THE EGG INSIDE THE BALLOON IT'S A SPONGY EGG 
AND YOU TWIST IT AND THAT WAS BEHIND MY FINGER OH WOW 
SO LOOK HOW GOOD THIS LOOKS LADIES LOOK WOW 
IF YOU REALLY HIT IT IT GOES IN 
IT GOES IN ALL I DO IS RELEASE THAT 
OH WHOSE BALLOON WAS THAT MINE 
BUT MAGIC IS NEVER AS EASY AS IT LOOKS 
NOW IS THAT WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DO 
I'M SCARED SCARED OF WHAT 
THE GIRLS ARE USED TO WINNING NOW 
BUT NOW THEY'RE STRUGGLING 
ALL EXCEPT ONE GIRL ELLIE CAUCHI 
BASICALLY THAT'S IT 
SHE'S CRACKED IT BUT IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR HER TO STAND OUT 
I'M ELLIE CAUCHI BUT YOU CAN CALL ME EMO CHILD 
ROCK ON 
EMO IS EMOTIONAL ROCKER 
EMOS WEAR BLACK EYELINER 
DIFFERENT COLOURS ON EACH FINGER BECAUSE THE SAME COLOUR IS BORING 
ELLIE'S HER OWN PERSON SHE'S A TOTAL INDIVIDUAL 
SHE WON'T FOLLOW ANY TREND SHE'LL DO WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO 
AND SHE'LL THINK FOR HERSELF 
I LIKE GETTING A REACTION 
BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL ORIGINAL YOU DON'T LIKE FOLLOWING PEOPLE 
YOU DO YOUR OWN THING 
HA HA 
ELLIE HAS BECOME A SHINING EXAMPLE TO HER FELLOW SORCEREES 
YOU DON'T LOOK AT THAT YOU GO AND HERE I HAVE TWO BALLOONS 
AND HERE I HAVE TWO BALLOONS 
WHO ARE NEEDING ALL THE HELP THEY CAN GET 
THE BOYS ARE PROBABLY PRACTISING IN GETTING A ROUTINE TOGETHER 
WE'RE STILL PLAYING WITH BALLOONS 
I FOUND THIS PACKAGE AT BREAKFAST 
I'VE WANTED TO OPEN IT ALL DAY BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD SAVE IT FOR YOU 
THE BOYS ARE CREATING THEIR STORYLINES WHAT'S KNOWN AS PATTER 
A WAND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED ONE OF THOSE 
ALWAYS LIKE FOR EVER 
A WAND A REAL WAND I MEAN TAPS THE WAND 
IT'S NOT PLASTIC IT'S A REAL WAND 
MR. KNIGHT LIKES WHAT HE SEES 
THE BOYS ARE MORE COMMITTED BECAUSE THE PRESSURE'S ON THEM 
THEY CAN USE THE SKILLS AND THE PROPS 
TO BE ABLE TO GIVE A NICE PERFORMANCE THAT'S WHAT I HOPE 
CONFIDENCE IS NOT SO HIGH IN THE GIRLS' CAMP 
I REALLY DO HAVE MY DOUBTS TODAY 
FIFTY PER CENT OF THE CLASS WILL DO FINE 
FIFTY PER CENT 
OF TEARS AND TRAGEDY 
I FEEL WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN THIS ONE AS WE KEEP POPPING BALLOONS 
AND WE DON'T MEAN TO POP THEM 
IT'S ANNOYING BECAUSE I'VE POPPED FIVE BALLOONS AND BROKEN TWO EGGS 
I'D SAY THE BOYS' TRICK IS PROBABLY EASIER THAN THE GIRLS' 
BUT ACCORDING TO THE GIRLS THEIR TRICK'S BETTER I DON'T THINK SO 
HELP YOURSELF TO MILK AND AN APPLE 
IT'S ELEVEN A M. AND AFTER A TOUGH LESSON THE SORCEREES ENJOY A BREAK 
BUT MR. KNIGHT IS ON THE WARPATH HE'S FOUND AN ABANDONED WAND 
A SERIOUS OFFENCE AT MAGIC SCHOOL 
COLLECT UP YOUR BOXES AND LET'S GO 
HE CALLS A SNAP INSPECTION 
GRAB SOME SEATS AROUND THERE 
OPEN UP YOUR CASE ARE YOU MISSING ANYTHING 
NO NO O. K. SAMMY OPEN UP YOUR CASE YEAH I'VE GOT EVERYTHING 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT EVERYTHING 
TOMOS OPEN UP YOUR CASE I'VE GOT EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING 
YEAH GOOD 
HARVEY OPEN UP YOUR CASE 
ARE YOU MISSING ANYTHING 
THE WAND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE SET IS THE MAGIC WAND 
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU MANAGED TO LEAVE LYING AROUND 
THIS IS NOT GOOD NEWS 
IT'S THE THIRD TIME HARVEY'S BEEN IN TROUBLE 
SINCE DAY ONE HE'S RELISHED BEING THE JOKER 
MY PLAN IS TO HAVE FUN 
AND NOT BE TOO STUCK INTO THE WORK 
YOU THINK YOU'RE A JACK THE LAD BUT YOU'RE NOT I DON'T 
NOW IT'S MAKE OR BREAK TIME FOR HARVEY 
DO YOU WANT IT BACK YES SURE SURE 
IF HE'S SERIOUS ABOUT MAGIC HE'S GOT TO PROVE IT 
YOU'LL HOLD THAT ABOVE YOUR HEAD YOU'LL RUN IN A CIRCLE FIVE TIMES 
SHOUTING OUT I LOVE MY MAGIC WAND DO IT FIVE TIMES GO

I LOVE MY MAGIC WAND THAT'S ONCE GO I LOVE MY MAGIC WAND 
COME ON AGAIN HARVEY 
HAS HE LEARNT HIS LESSON 
I'M TRYING TO BE A LOT BETTER 
BECAUSE I WANT TO TRY AND BECOME THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE 
AND I COULD IF I TRIED BE QUITE GOOD AT MAGIC 
GREAT MAGICIANS COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES

THOMAS BECKY 
THE STRICT REGIME HAS PUSHED OUR SORCEREES TO THE LIMIT 
THE STRICT REGIME HAS PUSHED OUR SORCEREES TO THE LIMIT 
BUT IT'S ALSO MADE THEM REALISE THE TRUE VALUE OF FRIENDSHIP 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY SENT ME A PICTURE OF ALL THE ANIMALS 
DOES IT MAKE YOU WANT TO GO HOME IT MAKES ME WANT TO CARRY ON 
IT MAKES YOU MORE DETERMINED 
I WAS QUITE UPSET BECAUSE I MISSED MY MUM'S BIRTHDAY YESTERDAY 
SO HAPPY BIRTHDAY MUM FOR YESTERDAY 
I DO MISS MY FAMILY BUT I'M ALL RIGHT I'LL STICK THROUGH IT 
FOR HARVEY THE LETTERS RECONFIRM HIS DETERMINATION TO KNUCKLE DOWN 
I WANT TO BE HERE BECAUSE THEN MAYBE I CAN GET REALLY GOOD AT MAGIC 
AND BE MORE LIKE DYNAMO AND THE SORCERER 
IT'S THE MORNING OF THE PERFORMANCE 
AND I'M GOING TO GO LIKE THAT 
AND THE BOYS ARE PUTTING THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO THEIR TRICKS 
I'M JUST GONNA PICK SOMEONE AND THEY'RE GONNA COME UP 
YEAH BOOM IT RESTORES 
COME ON IN TAKE YOUR SEATS 
BUT THE GIRLS ARE SUMMONED FOR AN EMERGENCY LESSON 
LADIES I'M REALLY CONCERNED SINCE THE LAST LESSON IT WAS REALLY BAD 
IT'S NOT ME THAT'S GOING TO BE ON THAT STAGE FAILING 
IT'S NOT A COMFORTABLE FEELING 
SO TO SET THE STANDARD MISS EVANS CALLS UP ELLIE

ELLIE'S A CLASS ACT 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SORCERER SIR

BUT THE REST ARE MILES BEHIND 
I'M SORRY THIS BALLOON'S COMING OUT MY FINGERS I'VE GOT THE EGG OH 
I PLACE THE BALLOON ABOVE MY HEAD 
AND 
THEY'LL NEED TO PULL OFF A MIRACLE IF THEY'RE GOING TO BEAT THE BOYS 
THE LAST TIME I WATCHED THEM PERFORM 
THE BOYS' PATTER WAS MUCH BETTER THAN THE GIRLS' PATTER 
BUT THE GIRLS' PERFORMANCE WAS BETTER THAN THE BOYS' 
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS TODAY 
THIS IS DEFINITELY THE TOUGHEST TRICK DEFINITELY BY FAR 
I'M GETTING BUTTERFLIES IN MY STOMACH AND I FEEL LIKE FAINTING 
I'M REALLY HOPING IT DOES GO A LOT BETTER COS I WANT TO TRY AND STAY 
SO FAR THE SORCEREES HAVE PERFORMED TWICE 
AND THE GIRLS HAVE WON BOTH TIMES 
THE BOYS CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THREE IN A ROW 
IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN TODAY UP ON THIS STAGE 
SO OUR TRAINEE SORCEREES ARE ABOUT TO SET FOOT ON THE STAGE 
TO PERFORM FOR THE SORCERER THEY'VE PRACTISED A LOT 
BUT WILL PRACTICE MAKE PERFECT ON THE DAY WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT 
SO IF THE BOYS COULD JOIN US AND THE GIRLS PREPARE FOR THEIR MAGIC 
LET THE SHOW BEGIN 
MISS LEONIE GIBSON 
HERE I HAVE TWO BALLOONS AND TWO EGGS 
IF I HOLD THE BALLOONS UP HIGH PLACE THE EGG INTO THERE 
OH MY GOD THERE'S AN EGG INSIDE THIS BALLOON 
AND WHAM 
IT'S NOWHERE 
THE GIRLS ARE TURNING IT AROUND

THE GIRLS NOW PIN ALL THEIR HOPES ON ELLIE 
ONE DAY I WENT TO LEONIE'S CIRCUS 
AND HER DAD CAME UP TO ME AND HE SAID

SO I TOOK THE EGG AND SMACK IT WAS INSIDE 
A POLISHED PERFORMANCE FROM ELLIE
