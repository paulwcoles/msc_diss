HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL 
FOR TONIGHT'S PROM LIVE HERE ON B. B. C. FOUR 
ON STAGE ARE THE FRANKFURT RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
MAKING THEIR PROMS DEBUT IN A PROGRAMME 
SHOWCASING FOUR GENERATIONS OF AUSTRO GERMAN COMPOSERS 
AFTER THE INTERVAL WE'RE GOING TO BE HEARING 
SCHOENBERG'S TRANSCRIPTION OF BRAHMS'S PIANO QUARTET IN G. MINOR 
BEFORE THAT THE BARITONE MATTHIAS GOERNE WILL BE SINGING 
A SELECTION OF SONGS FROM MAHLER'S DES KNABEN WUNDERHORN 
FIRST THOUGH WE HAVE WEBER'S OVERTURE TO HIS OPERA OBERON 
WHICH WAS FIRST PERFORMED AT COVENT GARDEN IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY SIX 
TO A WILDLY ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE 
BUT WEBER HIMSELF WASN'T THAT HAPPY 
HE PLANNED TO COMPLETELY REWRITE THE OPERA 
BUT THEN DIED JUST TWO MONTHS AFTER THE PREMIERE 
THE COMPLETE OPERA ISN'T PERFORMED VERY MUCH THESE DAYS 
BUT THE OVERTURE IS STILL VERY POPULAR 
AND STARTS WITH A SLOW HORN CALL AT THE BEGINNING 
WHICH BECOMES OBERON'S THEME 
SO HERE IS PAAVO JARVI 
CONDUCTING HIS OWN FRANKFURT RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
IN THE OVERTURE TO OBERON 
BY CARL MARIA VON WEBER 
THE OVERTURE TO WEBER'S OPERA OBERON 
PERFORMED HERE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL BY THE FRANKFURT RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
LED TONIGHT BY ALEJANDRO RUTKAUSKAS 
AND CONDUCTED BY THEIR CHIEF CONDUCTOR PAAVO JARVI 
SO IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THE BARITONE MATTHIAS GOERNE SING A SELECTION OF SONGS 
FROM MAHLER'S DES KNABEN WUNDERHORN 
I'M JOINED TONIGHT BY TWO GUESTS 
COMPOSER AND LECTURER IN MUSIC AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY ROBERT SAXTON 
AND HEAD OF MARKETING AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MUSIC JAMES MURPHY 
UM WEBER TENDS TO GET A BIT OVERLOOKED DOESN'T HE ROBERT 
WE HEAR ABOUT BEETHOVEN AND MAHLER AND ALL THESE GREAT NAMES 
BUT WEBER DO YOU FIND IT A STIMULATING LISTEN 
IT'S WONDERFUL MUSIC IT'S INTERESTING THAT WEBER OF COURSE 
WAS DISTANTLY RELATED TO MOZART'S WIFE 
SO HE HAS THAT CONNECTION WITH THE IMMEDIATE PAST IN HIS OWN TERMS 
HE DOES BEGIN TO BE THE FATHER OF GERMAN ROMANTICISM 
AND GERMAN UM OPERA 
AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IT DOES EVENTUALLY HIS MUSIC INFLUENCE WAGNER EARLY WAGNER 
SCHUMANN MENDELSSOHN A MIDSUMMER'S NIGHT'S DREAM WAS WRITTEN SHORTLY AFTER THE ONE WE'VE JUST HEARD 
AND THE INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN CLASSICAL MODELS 
MOZART HAYDN EVEN SCHUBERT WHO WAS HIS YOUNGER CONTEMPORARY 
IS THERE AND HE'S OVERLOOKED A BIT LIKE LISZT 
BECAUSE HE'S A CATALYST FIGURE 
AND IT'S RATHER UNFORTUNATE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HIS REPUTATION 
WELL IT'S A DEBUT FOR THE FRANKFURT RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA JAMES 
AND ALSO A DEBUT FOR MATTHIAS GOERNE WHOM WE'LL HEAR NEXT 
VERY EXCITING A SELECTION FROM DES KNABEN WUNDERHORN 
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL REALLY DELIVER THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT 
LUXURIOUS WAXED MAHOGANY SOUND 
YOU WANT FROM GERMAN PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRAS IT'S VERY BUSY MUSIC 
AND THEY HAVE REAL HARMONY TOGETHER THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PASS IT AROUND VERY WELL 
AND DES KNABEN WUNDERHORN IS A NINETEENTH CENTURY COLLECTION OF GERMAN FOLK POEMS 
THAT APPEALED TO MAHLER THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE WHY THE APPEAL 
WELL THERE ARE SEVERAL CONNECTIONS ACTUALLY 
MAHLER FINISHED WEBER'S OPERA DIE DREI PINTOS AND AT THE TIME LATER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
MAHLER WAS HAVING A LOVE AFFAIR WITH WEBER'S GREAT NIECE BY MARRIAGE 
SO THERE'S A DIRECT CONNECTION 
AND MAHLER WAS VERY ABSORBED IN THE POEMS OF THIS TYPE 
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THEM RIGHT NOW SUNG BY THE GERMAN BARITONE MATTHIAS GOERNE 
HERE IS PAAVO JARVI BACK TO CONDUCT THE FRANKFURT RADIO SYMPHONY 
AND MATTHIAS GOERNE IS GOING TO SING EIGHT SONGS TONIGHT FROM DES KNABEN WUNDERHORN

GUTE NACHT 
GUTE NACHT 
WELL WISHING US A RATHER SOMBRE GOOD NIGHT WAS THE DRUMMER BOY 
THE LAST IN THAT SELECTION OF SONGS FROM DES KNABEN WUNDERHORN 
THE YOUTH'S MAGIC HORN 
BY MAHLER 
BEAUTIFULLY SUNG TONIGHT BY THE GERMAN BARITONE MATTHIAS GOERNE 
AND HE WAS JOINING THE FRANKFURT RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA TONIGHT 
CONDUCTED BY THEIR CHIEF CONDUCTOR PAAVO JARVI 
MATTHIAS GOERNE HAS BEEN THE LEADING GERMAN BARITONE 
SINCE WINNING VARIOUS SONG COMPETITIONS IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES 
AND HE STUDIED WITH TWO OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SINGERS OF ALL TIME 
DIETRICH FISCHER DIESKAU AND ALSO THE LATE ELISABETH SCHWARZKOPF 
GOERNE SINGS NOT ONLY ON THE CONCERT STAGES AROUND THE WORLD 
BUT IS ALSO EQUALLY AT HOME IN THE OPERA HOUSE 
INCLUDING COVENT GARDEN 
WHERE HE SANG THE TITLE ROLE IN WOZZECK 
HE'S A GREAT FRIEND ALSO OF LONDON'S WIGMORE HALL 
NOW WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE THE SECOND HALF OF TONIGHT'S PROM 
WITH ME STILL ROBERT SAXTON AND JAMES MURPHY 
SORRY TO SLIGHTLY CUT YOU OFF EARLIER ROBERT NO PROBLEM 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE WONDERFUL RANGE OF EXPRESSION IN THAT MUSIC AND MATTHIAS GOERNE DID IT JUSTICE 
WOULDN'T YOU SAY 
WELL IT CERTAINLY WAS DONE JUSTICE BEAUTIFUL ORCHESTRAL PLAYING AND WONDERFUL BALLADS 
I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE WAY THAT MAHLER HAS CHOSEN POEMS 
FROM DES KNABEN WUNDERHORN WHICH COVER A CERTAIN TYPE OF EXPERIENCE 
IN HIS CASE A DEEP MELANCHOLY WHICH IS PERHAPS A NEW TYPE OF REALISM 
COMING OUT OF ROMANTICISM INTO THE MODERN ERA 
BUT ALSO AS YOU HEARD IN THE TWO MIDDLE SONGS A SENSE OF IRONY 
WHICH EVEN LEADS ON TO KURT WEILL 
AND THIS EXTRAORDINARY RANGE IN A WAY IT LOOKS BACK TO THE ROMANTIC ERA 
THAT WE HEARD OPENING SO MUCH WITH WEBER 
BUT AGAIN IT'S VERY PRESCIENT 
IT'S GOING ON INTO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THOUGH WRITTEN IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES I THINK 
GOERNE BRILLIANTLY CAPTURES THE SUDDEN LIGHT AND DARK WITH HIS FACE AS MUCH AS HIS VOICE 
HE'S GOT THESE EYES LIKE SAUCERS LIKE A CAPTIVATED CHILD AND SUDDENLY HE FILLS THEM WITH SHADOWS 
AS HE'S KIND OF STARING DEATH IN THE FACE REMARKABLE COMMUNICATION 
AND IT IS THESE CONTRASTS LIKE YOU SAY THERE'S HUMOUR PATHOS DRAMA 
AND ALL FROM THESE FOLK POEMS SO PRESUMABLY WE DON'T KNOW WHO WROTE THE WORDS 
YES WHAT'S INTERESTING IS ARNIM AND BRENTANO THIS COLLECTION IS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIX AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHT 
LONG BEFORE MAHLER WAS BORN AND YET IT SEEMS HE WAS ABLE TO CHOOSE POEMS 
WHICH SOMEHOW WERE PART OF THE FOLK GERMAN PSYCHE 
AND YET WERE SO RELEVANT TO HIM AS A BOHEMIAN JEW LIVING IN VIENNA 
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY CONJUNCTION WHICH BORE FRUIT 
IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH HE GOT FROM THIS THING 
WHICH WOULD BE LIKE YOU OR I TAKING AS MUCH FROM MOTHER GOOSE OR ROALD DAHL EVEN 
BUT THAT SENTIMENT OF I'M MORTALLY WOUNDED T. R. A. LA LA LA THAT'S MAHLER IN A NUTSHELL YES 
YES AND WONDERFUL ORCHESTRATION EVERYTHING AT THE SERVICE OF THE VOICE 
HE HAS THIS FANTASTIC UNDERSTANDING YES THIS WONDERFUL CHAMBER MUSIC ORCHESTRATION 
BUT SOMETHING JAMES SAID REMINDED ME 
MAHLER WAS ASKED AS A SMALL BOY WHAT HE WANTED TO BE WHEN HE GREW UP AND HE APPARENTLY SAID A MARTYR 
WHICH ACTUALLY GOES ALONG VERY WELL WITH WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID 
I DON'T REGARD THIS AS LIKE A SONG CYCLE SO MUCH AS FOR ME 
THEY'RE LIKE THE FOOTHILLS FOR THE MOUNTAIN RANGES OF MAHLER'S SYMPHONIES 
TWO OF THE SONGS WE'VE HEARD ARE IN THE SECOND SYMPHONY 
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER HALLMARKS ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
SO MANY SNATCHES OF THE SYMPHONIES 
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU LATER 
LET'S GO OVER TO ANGELLICA BELL 
THANKS VERITY WHEN SCHOENBERG'S FIVE ORCHESTRAL PIECES HAD THEIR WORLD PREMIERE AT THE PROMS IN NINETEEN TWELVE 
BOTH THE AUDIENCE AND THE ORCHESTRA HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE WORK 
SO HENRY WOOD ENCOURAGED HIS PLAYERS BY SAYING 
BUT THE FIRST PERFORMANCE OF SCHOENBERG'S ORCHESTRATION OF BRAHMS' PIANO QUARTET 
WHICH YOU'LL HEAR IN THE SECOND HALF OF TONIGHT'S CONCERT HAD A DIFFERENT RECEPTION 
IT WAS COMMISSIONED BY LEGENDARY CONDUCTOR OTTO KLEMPERER IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT 
HE PREMIERED IT WITH THE LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC AND THE ORCHESTRA'S MANAGER SAID THIS 
I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE CONCERT BACK TO YOU VERITY 
THANKS VERY MUCH ANGELLICA I'M DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED BY TONIGHT'S CONDUCTOR PAAVO JARVI 
IT MUST BE QUITE HARD PAAVO NOT TO GET CARRIED AWAY BY THE BEAUTY OF THAT KIND OF MUSIC WHEN CONDUCTING 
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT MAHLER ANYWAY THAT I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY 
BUT IT JUST GETS TO YOU EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU DO IT 
IT IT GETS 
IT PROBES THE DEPTHS YOU KNOW 
IT REALLY GETS TO YOU AND IT IS 
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS MUSIC THAT I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER MUSIC 
THAT CAN PORTRAY THE HUMAN CONDITION 
QUITE AS DIRECTLY AND HONESTLY AS MAHLER ESPECIALLY IN HIS SONGS 
AND SO BEAUTIFULLY SUNG TONIGHT BY MATTHIAS GOERNE 
MATTHIAS GOERNE IS THE BEST 
PROBABLY REALLY ONE OF THE GREATEST IN HIS REPERTOIRE YEAH 
IS HE DOING A LOT WITH THE MUSIC DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO FOLLOW HIM WHILE HE'S SINGING OH ABSOLUTELY 
YOU KNOW IT'S ALL ABOUT TEXT AND IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTER 
AND WE'VE DONE THEM SO MANY TIMES TOGETHER NOW 
THAT WE KIND OF HAVE OUR WAY OF DOING IT 
AND I FIND NOTHING THAT HE'S DOING DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW OR DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND 
BECAUSE IT'S SO ORGANIC AND IT'S SO UM SINCERE SOMEHOW 
AND SIMPLE 
THE KEY IS HONESTY AND SIMPLICITY 
AND HE HAS A DIRECTNESS OF EXPRESSION 
AND IT MAKES SENSE AND 
THE ORCHESTRA ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS TO HEAR IT 
AND THERE IS NOT MUCH ORGANISING NEEDED IT'S LOGICAL 
THAT'S WHAT COMES ACROSS YOU GET THE SENSE EVERYBODY'S LISTENING 
THERE IS A CHAMBER MUSIC ADDED TO IT THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THIS KIND OF MUSIC YEAH 
YOU'VE RECENTLY TAKEN ON BEING THE CHIEF CONDUCTOR OF THE FRANKFURT RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
YOU'RE ALSO CHIEF CONDUCTOR OF THE CINCINNATI SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA THAT'S TWO QUITE BIG JOBS 
IS THERE AN APPEAL TO HAVING TWO ORCHESTRAS AT YOUR DISPOSAL 
YOU KNOW THE 
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR A CONDUCTOR TO HAVE TWO ORCHESTRAS ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE OCEAN 
BUT THEY MIGHT GUEST CONDUCT WITH ONE 
YOU'VE TAKEN ON THE PRINCIPAL OF BOTH 
I FIND THAT THERE ARE REWARDS IN HAVING TWO ORCHESTRAS 
THEY ARE TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES 
AND THE TYPE OF MUSIC THAT WE CAN EXPLORE WITH THE FRANKFURT ORCHESTRA 
IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE MUSIC THAT WE EXPLORE WITH CINCINNATI 
AND THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY TO LEARN 
AND TO GIVE THAT EXPERIENCE TO ANOTHER ORCHESTRA 
SO IN OTHER WORDS 
OFTEN WHAT I LEARN HERE I CAN INCORPORATE IN THE PERFORMANCES IN AMERICA AND VICE VERSA 
SO OFTEN THERE IS AN INTERESTING AND QUITE DIFFERENT TAKE ON DIFFERENT ON THE SAME REPERTOIRE 
AND I FIND IT JUST MAKES MY LIFE RICHER SOMEHOW 
AND MORE INTERESTING MUSICALLY 
I WONDER IF YOU COULD DESCRIBE THE PERSONALITY OF THE FRANKFURT SYMPHONY 
WE'VE JUST HAD AN EMAIL FROM JOHN JACOB 
WHO SAYS THAT SECONDS INTO WEBER'S OBERON OVERTURE 
ONE THING IS CLEAR ABOUT THE FRANKFURT RADIO ORCHESTRA 
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY SWEET SOUND IS THAT A DESCRIPTION YOU AGREE WITH 
IT'S A VERY GOOD COMMENT BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REMEMBER CONDUCTING FIRST 
WAS A BRUCKNER SYMPHONY WITH THIS ORCHESTRA AND I THOUGHT 
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY HARD TO DESCRIBE IN WORDS 
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING IT SOUNDS LIKE A CLICHE 
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING VERY GERMANIC ABOUT THE SOUND AND SOUND PRODUCTION 
I FIND I FIND THERE IS SOMETHING EVEN THOUGH THE ORCHESTRA IS RELATIVELY YOUNG 
THERE IS A KIND OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE GERMAN REPERTOIRE 
AND ESPECIALLY GERMAN ROMANTIC REPERTOIRE 
ONE OF THE REASONS WE CHOSE WEBER IS BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THOSE PIECES THAT DOESN'T GET 
IT USED TO BE ABSOLUTELY STANDARD 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROGRAMMES OF FURTWAENGLER AND KLEMPERER AND SO ON WEBER AND VERDI OVERTURES 
USED TO BE ABSOLUTELY NORMAL OPENERS 
TODAY THIS SPOT IS TAKEN OFTEN FOR THE NEW MUSIC 
AND IT'S A PITY BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY QUINTESSENTIAL 
GERMAN ABOUT WEBER AND SOMETHING ABOUT THE WHOLE EXPRESSION 
THE KLANG THE SOUND QUALITY 
AND THE PRODUCTION OF SOUND 
AND ALSO UNDERSTANDING OF THAT REPERTOIRE 
MM 
WELL THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR TONIGHT IS SCHOENBERG'S TRANSCRIPTION OF 
I LOVE THE PIECE BY THE WAY WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THAT IN PARTICULAR 
BECAUSE I THINK FOR TWO REASONS 
NUMBER ONE I LOVE THE PIECE 
I THINK THAT IT IS REALLY NEGLECTED IN MANY WAYS 
OR DOESN'T GET DONE ENOUGH BECAUSE THE WORD SCHOENBERG STARS THERE 
AND PEOPLE ARE STILL TO THIS DAY 
SLIGHTLY APPREHENSIVE WHEN THEY SEE THE WORD SCHOENBERG 
WHICH IS I THINK STRANGE TO ME FRANKLY 
THE OTHER REASON IS THAT SINCE I WAS A. SINCE I CAME TO THE WEST SO TO SPEAK 
FIRST THING I CAME TO THE PROMS AND I REALISED THAT THIS IS ONE PLACE 
WHERE YOU CAN DO AND SHOULD BE DOING INTERESTING AND UNUSUAL 
SLIGHTLY OFF THE BEATEN TRACK REPERTOIRE 
BECAUSE IT IS OBVIOUS IT'S DIFFICULT TO SELL SYMPHONY CONCERTS 
BUT IF PROMS IF ANY PLACE IN LONDON CAN AFFORD AND SHOULD TAKE THE STEP 
IN TRYING TO INTRODUCE SLIGHTLY LESS POPULAR WORKS THAT'S THE PROMS 
A PERFECT INSTITUTION FOR IT 
IT IS THE BRAHMS' FIFTH SYMPHONY ACTUALLY 
AND ONCE PEOPLE HEAR IT 
THEY MIGHT CHANGE THEIR MIND ABOUT SCHOENBERG 
PAAVO JARVI THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING TO JOIN US 
I WILL LET YOU GET BACK TO THE PODIUM THANK YOU 
WE WERE HOPING TONIGHT TO TALK TO MATTHIAS GOERNE 
BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED ON STAGE HE WAS IN SLIGHT DISCOMFORT 
HE'S TORN SOME LIGAMENTS IN HIS LEG SO HE WON'T BE ABLE TO GIVE US AN INTERVIEW TONIGHT 
BUT WE CAN GO BACK NOW TO ANGELLICA BELL WHO IS BACKSTAGE 
WELL I'M JOINED BY A SOPRANO WHO HAS OFTEN SUNG MAHLER 
TERESA CAHILL THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE A PLEASURE 
YOU'RE A BIG FAN OF MAHLER'S 
I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE ESPECIALLY AS MY HUSBAND IS ALSO IN THIS BROADCAST 
I KNOW I WAS AT HOME COOKING HIS SUPPER WHEN THEY RANG DUTIFUL WIFE 
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE PERFORMANCE I THOUGHT IT WAS MARVELLOUS 
ADMITTEDLY SOME OF THE TIME I WAS WATCHING THROUGH THE MONITOR SOMETIMES IN THE HALL 
HE HAS A MARVELLOUS VOICE FOR MAHLER AND IT'S WONDERFUL TO HEAR A SINGER MAKING THE MOST OF THE POETRY 
BECAUSE IT IS HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE 
HE'S HAD GREAT TEACHERS TOO SO HE IS THE REAL THING 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT HE SANG AS MARVELLOUSLY IN THE SENSE THAT HE MUST BE IN A LOT OF PAIN 
IT MUST BE HARD FOR A SINGER TO GET UP THERE WHEN THEY ARE IN PAIN 
AND THEN TO PUT SO MUCH EXPRESSION IN THE MUSIC I THINK THE ADRENALINE HELPS 
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'S TAKEN ANY PAINKILLERS OR NOT 
SOME PEOPLE TAKE THEM OTHER PEOPLE SAY IT WILL MAKE ME TOO RELAXED 
AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THE BODY ENERGY I NEED 
SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE HAS TAKEN ANY OR NOT I ONCE TOOK SOME 
AND I FELT SO RELAXED I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS ANY GOOD OR NOT 
SO I'M SURE HE PROBABLY HASN'T IN WHICH CASE IT'S EVEN MORE EXTRAORDINARY 
BUT HE HAS A VERY GOOD VOCAL TECHNIQUE AND IN THE END 
THE OCCASION TAKES YOU I THINK 
AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE PROMENADERS THOUGHT OF IT SO I THINK HE'S HAD A VERY BIG SUCCESS 
YOU MENTIONED HIS GREAT TEACHERS HE'S BEEN TAUGHT BY DIESKAU AND BY SCHWARZKOPF 
HAVE YOU HEARD THAT IN HIS SINGING TONIGHT IS IT A TRADITION YES IT IS A GREAT TRADITION 
A LOT OF BARITONES ARE ALL WANTING TO BE THE NEXT DIESKAU 
THEY'VE SAID THIS ABOUT GOERNE BUT I THINK GOERNE IS VERY MUCH HIS OWN MAN 
THESE SONGS I DO ACTUALLY PREFER THEM SUNG BY A BARITONE OR A MEZZO 
ALTHOUGH I HAVE SUNG THEM MYSELF 
IN FACT I SANG THEM ONCE AND CAME BACK FROM ABROAD 
TO BE INVITED TO MAHLER'S DAUGHTER'S FUNERAL 
SHE'S BURIED IN HIGHGATE CEMETERY O. K. AND WE KNOW HIS GRANDDAUGHTER 
AND SHE ASKED US JUST AFTER I'D SUNG THESE SONGS 
AND A LOT OF MAHLER IS ABOUT DEATH 
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY I PREFER ALTHOUGH SOPRANOS DO SING THEM AND I SING THEM 
BUT USUALLY WHEN A SOPRANO SINGS THEY SHARE WITH A BARITONE WHO DOES THE REALLY SERIOUS ONES 
I WAS BROUGHT UP WITH A LOT OF MEZZOS FERRIER JANET BAKER CHRISTA LUDWIG 
AND SOME WONDERFUL BARITONES AS WELL 
AND I THINK I PERSONALLY PREFER A BARITONE SINGING THEM 
AND THE LIGHTER ONES MAYBE FOR A MEZZO TO DO I THINK PARTLY BECAUSE THE POETRY IS REALLY IMPORTANT 
AND I THINK IT IS HARDER FOR HIGH SOPRANOS TO GET THE WORDS ACROSS 
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME GREAT SINGERS MARGARET PRICE HAS DONE THEM LOTS OF SOPRANOS HAVE DONE 
IT'S JUST MY PREFERENCE IS FOR A BARITONE A BARITONE VOICE AND A MEZZO 
NOW YOU SAID THAT MAHLER'S MUSIC IS QUITE SOMBRE 
HOW DO YOU CONNECT WITH THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A BRIGHT CHARACTER 
WELL I DON'T THINK I WOULD SING THE VERY SERIOUS ONES 
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WE REACT TO THE POETRY 
MY VOICE DOESN'T SOUND PARTICULARLY SAD ADMITTEDLY 
BUT MAHLER HAS A LUSCIOUS SENSE TO HIS MUSIC AS WELL 
AND THEY'RE NOT ALL SAD IT'S JUST THAT AGAIN LIED VON DER ERDE IS A TENOR FOR EXAMPLE 
BUT WITH A MEZZO 
SO I DO THINK THE MEZZOS DO BETTER 
BUT I'VE SUNG THE SYMPHONIES FAR MORE THAN THE SONGS ACTUALLY I HAVE DONE THEM WITH SOLTI IN CHICAGO 
AND I DID A PERFORMANCE OF MAHLER EIGHT ON C. D. 
AS PART OF A WHOLE CYCLE THAT THIS VERY ORCHESTRA DID 
SO IT'S NICE TO HEAR THEM AGAIN AND THAT WAS WITH ELIAHU INBAL ONE OF THEIR PREVIOUS MUSICAL DIRECTORS 
AND I'VE HAD GREAT EXPERIENCES SINGING MAHLER FOUR WITH TENNSTEDT 
SO I HAVE DONE THE SYMPHONIES MORE THAN THE SONGS O. K. 
BUT I THINK HE DID A MARVELLOUS JOB TONIGHT 
NOW YOU ALSO TEACH AS WELL AS SING AT THE TRINITY COLLEGE IN LONDON 
HOW DO YOU APPROACH MAHLER TO YOUR STUDENTS WELL I THINK HE'S VERY 
I THINK YOU NEED TO BE FAIRLY MATURE TO SING IT IT'S VERY DEMANDING TECHNICALLY 
AND ER THE EMOTIONS ARE SO RAW OFTEN THAT I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE A VERY GOOD TECHNIQUE 
AND HAVE ALMOST A SLIGHT DETACHMENT WHEN YOU SING THEM 
OTHERWISE YOU'D BE WORKING TOO HARD IN THE WRONG WAY 
BUT HE'S A MATURE SINGER HE HAS A MARVELLOUS PHYSIQUE 
AND I THINK HE CAN DO IT WITHOUT BEING IN ANY WAY DANGEROUS 
BUT I THINK THE EMOTIONS ARE VERY DEEP AND VERY POWERFUL INDEED 
AND YOU NEED TO BE VERY SURE OF YOURSELF 
AND I THINK YOUNG SINGERS PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DO THEM TOO YOUNG 
THEY'RE VERY PROFOUND POETRY AND I THINK YOU SING THEM BETTER WHEN YOU GET OLDER 
TROUBLE IS YOU WAIT AND WAIT AND WORK AND THEN YOU SING THEM AT YOUR PEAK 
AND MAYBE GO DOWN QUITE SOON AFTER THAT 
GOOD WORDS OF ADVICE THERE ANY PLANS FOR WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING IN THE FUTURE 
WELL THESE DAYS I DO MUCH MORE I DO CERTAIN CONCERTS 
BUT I'M QUITE OLD NOW YOU'RE NOT OLD AND I DON'T HAVE AN AGENT ANY MORE 
SO BASICALLY I DO LESS CONCERTS BUT I DO A LOT OF EXAMINATION 
I'VE JUST BEEN AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MUSIC AS AN EXTERNAL EXAMINER 
I DO MY TWO DAYS AT TRINITY COLLEGE 
AND I'VE DONE LOTS OF INTERNATIONAL JURIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
LOTS OF EXAMINING AND HELPING YOUNG SINGERS IS SOMETHING I REALLY BELIEVE IN 
I LOVE DOING MASTERCLASSES 
SO HOW DO YOU JUDGE YOUNG SINGERS 
WELL NOW AND AGAIN I THINK IT'S TERRIBLY EASY FOR SOMEONE MY AGE 
BROUGHT UP WITH MASSES OF SCHWARZKOPF LUDWIG FISCHER DIESKAU 
TO THINK THIS GENERATION ISN'T AS GOOD 
THEN YOU HEAR SOMEONE LIKE GOERNE AND YOU THINK YES THE TRADITION IS BEING CARRIED ON 
BUT I'M VERY FUSSY TECHNICALLY WITH MY SINGERS 
AND THEN YOU FIND A REALLY WONDERFUL SINGER WHO BREAKS THE RULES AND THE VOICE COMES OUT WONDERFULLY ANYWAY 
I JUST HEARD KOSTOV RECENTLY DOING WINTERREISE ON THE T. V. AND I WAS COMPLETELY KNOCKED OUT BY IT 
ALTHOUGH HE DID THINGS I WAS A BIT SURPRISED AT BUT IT WORKED 
BUT IT'S GOOD TO BE FUSSY BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN FIND THE STARS OF THE FUTURE ABSOLUTELY 
AND WE WILL HAVE QUITE A FEW I'M SURE 
FANTASTIC THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO US GREAT PLEASURE VERITY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANGELLICA 
IN A FEW MINUTES' TIME WE WILL HAVE THE SECOND HALF OF TONIGHT'S CONCERT 
WHICH IS SCHOENBERG'S ORCHESTRATION OF BRAHMS'S G. MINOR PIANO QUARTET 
BACK WITH ME ARE ROBERT SAXTON AND JAMES MURPHY SO MANY THREADS ARE RUNNING THROUGH THIS CONCERT 
BUT WHAT WAS IT THAT SCHOENBERG SO LOVED ABOUT BRAHMS 
WELL SOME PEOPLE AT HOME ARE PROBABLY THINKING SCHOENBERG'S A BIT OF A MUSICAL TERRORIST 
WHO PROBABLY VANDALISED BRAHMS 
BUT IN ACTUAL FACT HE SAW HIMSELF AS A PROGRESSIVE 
AND HE WAS BUILDING ON WHAT HIS FOREBEARS WERE DOING 
SO THEY TOOK TONALITY TO THE BRINK AND HE TOOK IT FURTHER 
AND SO HE HAS MASSIVE RESPECT FOR THEM ESPECIALLY FOR BRAHMS 
ALMOST A NOSTALGIA I THINK 
COMES ACROSS IN THIS ORCHESTRATION ABSOLUTELY TRUE 
SCHOENBERG TAUGHT OFF THE GREAT CLASSICAL MASTERS AND BRAHMS 
AND IT'S VERY EASY FOR US TO FORGET HOW TELESCOPED HISTORY IS 
BRAHMS AND SCHOENBERG LIVED IN THE SAME CITY VIENNA 
AND SCHOENBERG WAS TWENTY THREE WHEN BRAHMS DIED SO BRAHMS WASN'T HISTORY TO HIM 
HE'D BEEN A LIVING PART OF HIS YOUTH DID THEY MEET DO WE KNOW 
I DON'T THINK THEY EVER MET I THINK ZEMLINSKY SCHOENBERG'S EVENTUAL BROTHER IN LAW AND ONLY EVER TEACHER 
SHOWED A SCORE OF SCHOENBERG'S TO BRAHMS SO WE'RE TOLD 
AND ALSO WE MUST REMEMBER THAT BRAHMS WAS VERY KIND TO MAHLER 
BRAHMS COULD BE PRETTY GRUDGING TO YOUNG MUSICIANS 
SO THERE'S A LINK FROM THE WEBER TO THE MAHLER TO MAHLER KNOWING BRAHMS 
AND OF COURSE MAHLER PART OF MAHLER'S DYING WORDS TO UM ALMA WERE 
LOOK AFTER SCHOENBERG FOR ME 
AND MAHLER LENT SCHOENBERG MONEY OR GAVE SCHOENBERG MONEY 
SO IT'S AN INCREDIBLE UNITY 
YOU SEE I THOUGHT THE LINK TONIGHT WAS THAT OBERON HAS THAT WONDERFUL HORN AT THE START 
THEN THERE'S THE WUNDERHORN AND THEN SCHOENBERG BRINGS SOME WONDERFUL HORNS TO BRAHMS'S MUSIC VERY GOOD 
ACTUALLY RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ORCHESTRATION 
SCHOENBERG SWITCHES FOR ONE BAR FROM THE VIOLINS TO THE HORN 
TO NOTICE A SLIGHT SUBTLE MOVE FROM G. MINOR TO B. FLAT 
SO HE USES THE HORN HE CERTAINLY BRINGS IN SOME INSTRUMENTS THAT BRAHMS WOULDN'T HAVE USED 
HE DID SAY THAT HE WAS USING THE INSTRUMENTS BRAHMS WOULD HAVE 
BUT AS IT GOES ALONG IT'S LIKE TOWARDS THE END THE REVERENCE GOES OUT OF THE WINDOW 
AND SUDDENLY THIS IS SCHOENBERG IN L. A. YES 
WE GET A GLIMPSE OF A HOLLYWOOD CARTOON SCORE HE MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN WITH XYLOPHONES IT'S MAGNIFICENT 
BUT IT IS A BRAHMSIAN SIZED ORCHESTRA ISN'T IT HE DOESN'T GO TOO MAD 
IT'S A BIT BIGGER BUT I THINK THE THING IS IF YOU KNOW THE TWO SCHOENBERG CHAMBER SYMPHONIES 
PERHAPS YOU CAN HEAR THAT A LOT OF IT IS SCHOENBERG 
AND IN FACT IT REMINDS ME NOT SO MUCH OF BRAHMS AS A SYMPHONIST AS THE BRAHMS OF THE SERENADES ACTUALLY 
THE ORCHESTRAL SERENADES WHICH PREDATED BRAHMS' SYMPHONIES 
AND I THINK WHAT SCHOENBERG DOES BRING OUT IS THE CLARITY OF THE MOTIFIC WORK AND THE COUNTERPOINT 
WHAT IT LOSES PERHAPS IS IT'S NO LONGER CHAMBER MUSIC OBVIOUSLY 
AND IT'S THE OLD BUSINESS THAT IF YOU ORCHESTRATE BEETHOVEN'S PIANO SONATA 
IT'S NO LONGER A TITANIC STRUGGLE OF ONE PIANIST AND ONE PIANO 
I THINK NEEDLESS TO SAY IF YOU TAKE A PIANO OUT OF SOMETHING IT BECOMES LESS PERCUSSIVE 
BECAUSE ALL PERCUSSIVE INSTRUMENTS BY THEIR VERY NATURE ARE RESONANT SO THE SECOND MOVEMENT IS DAINTY 
BUT IT BECOMES ALMOST COQUETTISH IN THE ORCHESTRA 
AND ALSO IN A SENSE THE ORCHESTRAL VERSION PREPARES US MORE FOR THE SHOWSTOPPING FINALE 
BECAUSE HE HAS MUCH BIGGER FLOURISHES THROUGHOUT THE WORK 
WHAT IT ALSO REMINDS US OF IS WHAT A GREAT ORCHESTRATOR SCHOENBERG WAS 
IF YOU THINK OF GURRE LIEDER PELLEAS AND MELISANDE 
AND YOU MADE A VERY GOOD POINT EARLIER 
THAT PEOPLE THINK OF SCHOENBERG AS THE BOGEY MAN OF TWENTIETH CENTURY OF MUSIC 
I FIND THAT SO AMAZING THAT STILL NOW IT'S LIKE THAT 
BUT OF COURSE IT'S A TRIBUTE TO SCHOENBERG AS MY TEACHER ELISABETH LUTYENS ONCE SAID 
OF ALL THE TWENTIETH CENTURY COMPOSERS HE'S REMAINED RADICAL WHICH IS A TRIBUTE TO THE POWER OF HIS VISION 
BUT HE WAS A GREAT ORCHESTRATOR AND YOU CAN HEAR IT HERE 
I THINK ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THAT LAST MOVEMENT 
IS HE WAS A PAINTER AND HE WAS GREAT FRIENDS WITH KANDINKSY AND IT'S LIKE AN EXPLOSION OF ORCHESTRAL COLOUR 
THAT HE APPLIES TO BRAHMS AT THE END YES SO WHY DID HE CHOOSE THIS PARTICULAR PIECE BY BRAHMS 
WHY THIS PIANO QUARTET I THINK I'M RIGHT IN SAYING KLEMPERER CHOSE IT 
BECAUSE PEOPLE WEREN'T COMMISSIONING HIS SURREALISM SO KLEMPERER WANTED TO GET HIM SOME WORK 
AND SAW ONE WAY AS TRANSCRIPTIONS OF OLD CLASSICAL MASTERPIECES IT WAS NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN WASN'T IT 
SCHOENBERG SAID TO SOMEBODY 
OR WROTE A LETTER TO SOMEBODY IN AMERICA 
SAYING THIS PIECE IS ALWAYS BADLY PLAYED AND I WANT TO HEAR IT CLEARLY AND PROPERLY 
THE PIANIST ALWAYS GETS CARRIED AWAY AND YOU CAN'T HEAR THE STRINGS 
DEPENDS ON THE PIANIST 
THE PROBLEM WHICH SCHOENBERG HAD TO SOLVE WHICH MAY INTEREST VIEWERS 
IS THE PIANO HAS A VERY POWERFUL BASS 
AND THE ORCHESTRA ACTUALLY IN COMPARISON DOESN'T 
SO SCHOENBERG HAD TO FIND WAYS OF MAKING THE BASS STRONG 
IN A VERY BRAHMSIAN WAY 
IF WE COME BACK TO THIS ORCHESTRA MAKING THEIR DEBUT AT THE PROMS THEY HAVE A VERY RICH SOUND YES 
AND THEY PLAY THIS WONDERFULLY THE SLOW MOVEMENT WAS MARVELLOUS IN REHEARSAL INDEED 
AND JARVI PUTS A LOT OF SPACE INTO IT ESPECIALLY TOWARDS THE END IT'S VERY FUNNY MUSIC AS WELL 
SCHOENBERG PUTS IN A LITTLE BIT OF FLATULENCE LISTEN OUT FOR THAT 
ONE OR TWO TROMBONE MOMENTS ARE INTERESTING IT'S QUITE HAIR RAISING BRAHMS WOULDN'T HAVE APPROVED 
BUT BRAHMS WAS HAVING FUN AND SCHOENBERG IS HAVING FUN TOO 
I WAS TALKING TO PAAVO JARVI A LITTLE EARLIER AND HE WAS SAYING 
THAT THIS COULD BE SEEN AS BRAHMS'S FIFTH SYMPHONY 
PRESUMABLY YOU WOULDN'T AGREE WITH THAT HE CALLED IT THE FIFTH SYMPHONY DIDN'T HE OH REALLY 
HE DUBBED IT THAT EN PASSANT DODGY IT OF COURSE SHOULD BE LIKE BRUCKNER WROTE A SYMPHONY NUMBER NOUGHT 
OF COURSE THIS SHOULD BE BRAHMS' SYMPHONY NUMBER NOUGHT COS IT APPEARED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY ONE I THINK 
WHEN BRAHMS WAS IN HIS LATE TWENTIES BRAHMS' MUSIC ALWAYS SOUNDS OLD 
AND WE FORGET HOW YOUNG HE WAS WHEN HE WROTE SOME OF IT SO THIS PREDATES BRAHMS' FIRST SYMPHONY BY AGES 
DO WE KNOW WHAT HE THOUGHT OF IT HE WAS NOTORIOUSLY SELF CRITICAL 
THIS WAS ONE OF HIS CHAMBER WORKS HE REALLY ALLOWED TO STAND WITH CONVICTION 
THE TWO PIANO QUARTETS I THINK HE WAS VERY PROUD OF 
AND THE FIRST MOVEMENT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY ORIGINAL TAKE 
ON THE SONATA FORM IT'S EXTRAORDINARY 
WHERE IT GOES WITH THE EIGHT OPENING NOTES IS SPECTACULAR BRILLIANT THE ORGANIC UNITY IS STAGGERING 
FOR ANY COMPOSER LET ALONE SOMEONE IN THEIR LATE TWENTIES 
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT INSPIRED SCHOENBERG COS IT FEELS LIKE IT'S BUSTING ITS BOUNDS AS A QUARTET 
ABSOLUTELY 
AND THIS OF COURSE IS HIS WAY OF PAYING HOMAGE ISN'T IT I MEAN 
THAT'S WHY HE ORCHESTRATED WAS TO PAY HOMAGE TO HIS HEROES 
MAYBE HE WAS TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE ACTUALLY I AM ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS I DO LIKE THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE ME 
I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE HERE WAS A MAN WHO WAS A REFUGEE 
LIVING ON THE WEST COAST OF AMERICA WHICH HAD GIVEN HIM A HOME HE WAS STILL TEACHING INTO HIS SEVENTIES 
AND THE FACT IS THAT HE TAUGHT PEOPLE OFF THIS MUSIC 
HE WROTE BOOKS ANALYSING IT HE WROTE A WONDERFUL ESSAY BRAHMS THE PROGRESSIVE 
SAYING BRAHMS WASN'T A DIEHARD CONSERVATIVE HE WAS ACTUALLY SUBTLY A VERY PROGRESSIVE ARTIST 
I THINK HE WAS PROBABLY AS I SAID TO JAMES ORCHESTRATING A PIECE HE HIMSELF WOULD LOVE TO HAVE WRITTEN 
FROM A CULTURE HE'D HAD TO LEAVE 
WELL THE STAGE HAS FILLED UP 
AND WE'LL JUST AWAIT TONIGHT'S CONDUCTOR PAAVO JARVI 
AND HERE HE IS PAAVO JARVI TO CONDUCT THE FRANKFURT RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
IN THE PIANO QUARTET IN G. MINOR BY BRAHMS 
ORCHESTRATED IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT BY ARNOLD SCHOENBERG
