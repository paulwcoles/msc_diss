THAN WITH ONE HUNDRED EXCITING MATH PROBLEMS 
ALL RIGHT CLASS NEXT IT'S OUR TURN TO PUT ON A PLAY ANY IDEAS 
SUE ELLEN I DON'T WANNA DO SOME GIRLS' PLAY 
HOW ABOUT A SPOOKY STORY WITH THUNDER AND LIGHTNING 
AND A MASSIVE MONSTER MADE OF MUCUS WHO GETS HIS ARMS PULLED OFF 
OH NO 
IMAGINATIVE BUT A BIT TOO COMPLICATED FOR US SUE ELLEN 
LET'S SIMULATE SPACE TRAVEL I CAN MAKE ROCKET FUEL 
AGAIN TOO COMPLICATED HOW ABOUT THE STORY OF INVENTOR THOMAS EDISON 
DID HE INVENT STUFF THAT WOULD HIT ME NO CAN YOU NAME HIS INVENTIONS 
THE DEWEY DECIMAL SYSTEM NO THAT WAS DEWEY 
OH I THOUGHT THAT WAS HIS MIDDLE NAME 
THOMAS ALVA EDISON INVENTED THE PHONOGRAPH 
THE RECORD PLAYER 
IT WAS BEFORE C. D.'S 
IT PLAYED MUSIC WITH A NEEDLE IS THAT A JOKE 
NO I THINK THIS PLAY WILL BE VERY EDUCATIONAL FOR EVERYONE 
COULD YOU GIVE FRANCINE A GOOD PART IN THE PLAY SHE'S NEVER HAD ONE 
I'LL CERTAINLY CONSIDER IT 
FRANCINE WOULD BE GOOD IF SHE DIDN'T GET HIT IN THE FACE 
I REALISE I'M THE OBVIOUS EDISON BUT MIGHT I SUGGEST FRANCINE 
YOU WANT FRANCINE TO GET A GOOD PART 
UH YEAH 
HE'S SO SMART IT'S SCARY 
I WAS THE WALL IN HUMPTY DUMPTY 
I WAS PLYMOUTH ROCK ON THANKSGIVING 
I HOPE THERE'S A WALL IN THIS PLAY 
BUSTER SINCE YOU HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY 
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST LIGHTBULB I'M ALSO VERY BRIGHT 
ARTHUR YOU'RE THE FIRST PHONOGRAPH 
BINKY YOU'RE A LOCOMOTIVE YE ES 
FOR THE PART OF THOMAS EDISON 
FRANCINE 
I I'M A STAR 
I WON'T LET THE CLASS DOWN I'M GONNA GIVE ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT TO THIS PART 
THE THOMAS EDISON SECTION PLEASE 
IN BIOGRAPHIES HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS OWN SECTION 
WHAT DOES A MAN HAVE TO DO TO BE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT 
WHAT ARE THOSE CAN YOU BELIEVE THESE ARE THE ONLY BOOKS ON EDISON 
YEAH WANNA COME TO THE SUGAR BOWL 
I HAVE NO TIME FOR ICE CREAM AND CHILDISH SMALLTALK 
WHAT'S WITH HER BEATS ME 
I'M TRYING TO READ SHAKESPEARE SORRY CATHERINE 
BUT IF I'M TO PLAY EDISON I NEED EXPERIENCE WITH ELECTRIC LIGHTS 
WHY NOT STUDY PHOTOGRAPHS HE INVENTED THOSE 
GOOD IDEA I WILL AS SOON AS I'M DONE HERE 
MOTHER 
FILM IS PULLED PAST THE SHUTTER DON'T OPEN IT YOU'LL EXPOSE THE 
FILM 
HEY FRANCINE FRANCINE 
WANNA GO TO THE MALL OR HANG OUT OR SOMETHING 
NO BUT YOU'RE WELCOME TO STUDY INCANDESCENT FILAMENTS HOW BORING 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MALL STUFF TO BUY CLOTHES TO TRY ON 
MY INVENTIONS ARE NOT BORING WITHOUT LIGHTS 
YOU'D HAVE TO SHOP IN THE DARK SORRY I GUESS YOU ALREADY DO 
THAT WAS MEAN SHE INSULTED INCADESCENT FILAMENTS FIRST 
IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEMS I CAN REDESIGN YOUR COSTUMES 
WHAT'S THAT I'M A LIGHTBULB 
YOU'RE AN INCANDESCENT LAMP I MEANT THESE THOSE ARE AIR HOLES 
IF IT HAD AIR HOLES IT WOULDN'T WORK DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING 
BUT ARE YOU TYING TO RUIN THIS PLAY NO AIR HOLES O. K. 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE WHEN THE FIRST LIGHTBULB WAS INVENTED FRANCINE 
YOU'RE WRONG MR. RATBURN GASPS 
EDISON INVENTED THE INCANDESCENT LAMP 
IT WASN'T CALLED THE LIGHTBULB TILL MUCH LATER O. K. SHE'S DOOMED 
YOU'RE RIGHT FRANCINE MY MISTAKE ALSO IT'S TIME FOR REHEARSAL 
NO NO NO NO NO NO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM FRANCINE 
SUE ELLEN'S FILM HAS NO SPROCKET HOLES 
HOW COULD IT WORK WITHOUT SPROCKET HOLES 
LET'S GO HAVE THE BRAIN FIX THAT 
FRANCINE WHY AREN'T YOU WEARING YOUR BELL IT MAKES EVERYTHING ECHO 
DO IT RIGHT OR I'LL UNINVENT YOU AND YOU WON'T BE IN MY PLAY AT ALL 
THIS IS OUR OWN FAULT WE ASKED RATBURN TO GIVE HER A GOOD PART 
SHE ACTS LIKE IT'S HER SHOW MUFFY COULDN'T YOU SPEAK TO HER 
I COULD BUT I'M NOT SPEAKING TO HER 
FRANCINE INSULTED HER CLOTHES 
I COULD POUND HER NO 
THAT'S O. K. I'LL TALK TO HER 
MAKE IT QUICK DRESS REHEARSAL TOMORROW 
THEN OUR PARENTS WILL BE HERE TOMORROW NIGHT
