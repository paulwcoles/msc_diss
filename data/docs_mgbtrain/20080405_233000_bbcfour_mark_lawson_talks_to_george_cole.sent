MOST CHILD ACTORS ARE IN REHAB OR RETIREMENT 
BY THE TIME THEY ARE TEENAGERS 
BUT GEORGE COLE THOUGH HE FIRST APPEARED ON STAGE IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN 
IS STILL ONE OF THE LEADING MEMBERS OF HIS PROFESSION SIXTY EIGHT YEARS LATER 
HIS MOST PROFITABLE ROLES HAVE BEEN AS MEN DESPERATE TO MAKE A PROFIT 
FIRST FLASH HARRY IN THE SAINT TRINIAN'S FILMS 
THEN A LATTER DAY BLACK MARKETEER THE CAR SALESMAN ARTHUR DALEY 
HE BECAME AN EMBLEM OF THE THATCHERITE EIGHTIES 
IN THE LONG RUNNING I. T. V. SERIES MINDER 
BUT COLE HAS REMAINED CONSISTENTLY BUSY RECENTLY APPEARING IN A NUMBER OF T. V. PLAYS 
ABOUT MODERN BRITAIN BY THE WRITER TONY GROUNDS 
INCLUDING BODILY HARM A CLASS APART AND THE DINNER PARTY 
HE IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW PERFORMERS WHOSE CAREERS HAVE STRETCHED 
FROM THE ERA OF MUSIC HALL TO THE AGE OF D. V. D. S. 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS CHANGED A LOT IN YOUR LIFETIME FOR ACTORS 
IS THAT D. V. D. MEANS THAT YOU CAN WATCH YOUR OWN WORK IF YOU WANT TO 
THERE ARE BOX SETS OF MINDER SAINT TRINIAN'S AND SO ON 
DO YOU EVER SIT DOWN AND WATCH IT 
ALWAYS 
PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY REPEAT IT ON TELEVISION 
BUT NOW I'VE GOT ALL THE D. V. D. S. BUT 
NO I LOVE IT 
IT'S INTERESTING SOME ACTORS CAN'T BEAR TO WATCH THEMSELVES BACK 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT HOW DO YOU LEARN ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT OR WRONG IF YOU DON'T WATCH 
EVEN NOW YOU CATCH YOURSELF DOING SOMETHING AND THINK I COULD HAVE DONE THAT BETTER 
VERY RARELY 
NO BUT YOU DO CATCH YOURSELF 
I THINK WE WERE TALKING EARLIER NOT LISTENING 
AND YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE LISTENING A BIT MORE EARNESTLY THAN YOU WERE 
BUT GENERALLY NO I DON'T THINK I COULD IMPROVE VERY MUCH 
CERTAINLY NOT ON MINDER 
I READ THAT YOU'D READ A BOOK BY THE AMERICAN ACTOR ALAN ALDER 
CALLED NEVER HAVE YOUR DOG STUFFED AND HE HAS A WHOLE CHAPTER 
ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ACTORS LISTENING 
TO OTHER ACTORS WHICH SEEMS OBVIOUS BUT A LOT OF ACTORS DON'T DO IT 
NO THEY DON'T 
I MEAN SOME YOUNG ACTORS THINK IT'S A MATTER OF LEARNING THE LINES 
AND IF YOU'VE LEARNED THE LINES YOU'RE THERE YOU'RE NOT 
YOU KNOW YOU CAN SAY YOUR LINES 
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO WHAT THE OTHER PERSON SAYS 
YOU'RE NOT REPLYING YOU'RE JUST SAYING THE LINES 
NOW I FOUND THAT FASCINATING THAT CHAPTER 
THE WORSE PART OF BEING AN ACTOR IT SEEMS TO ME AS AN OUTSIDER 
IS EVEN SOMEONE AS SUCCESSFUL AS YOU 
AND YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY MUCH IN WORK FOR SIXTY EIGHT YEARS NOW 
EVEN THAT YOU'RE DEPENDENT ON SOMEBODY GIVING YOU A JOB 
THE SCRIPT COMING THROUGH THE DOOR 
DO YOU GET USED TO THAT INSECURITY 
YES YOU DO 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT 
NO I THINK THE ONLY TIME YOU WORRY IS 
IF YOU DO HAVE A LONG PERIOD OUT OF WORK 
AND NOTHING HAS COME IN BUT I HAVEN'T HAD ANY OF THOSE 
I WAS AMAZED LOOKING AT THE LIST OF YOUR CREDITS 
PRETTY MUCH EVERY YEAR IN THE SIXTY EIGHT YEARS 
THERE'S AT LEAST ONE THING SOMETIMES SEVERAL YES TRUE 
SO YOU HAVEN'T YOU'VE NEVER HAD PERIODS OF WORRY 
OR FEAR ABOUT WHAT WAS COMING NEXT 
I HAD ONE PERIOD OF ELEVEN MONTHS 
FOLLOWED BY I THINK FOUR DAYS IN GONE TO EARTH 
A MICHAEL POWELL FILM 
BUT AFTER THAT THAT WAS THE WORST I EVER HAD 
SO I WASN'T WORRIED 
AND I GOT THROUGH IT ANYWAY 
AND YOU'VE JUST DONE A TELEVISION ROLE WITH DONALD SINDEN 
WHO IS EIGHTY FOUR TWO YEARS OLDER THAN YOU 
ACTORS TEND NOT TO RETIRE THEY JUST KEEP GOING 
DO YOU WELCOME THAT OR HAVE YOU EVER FELT 
YOU'D LIKE TO BE IN A PROFESSION WHERE THEY GIVE YOU A LEAVING PARTY 
AND SEND YOU OFF TO PUT YOUR FEET UP NO NO 
NO I DON'T WANT TO STOP 
I MEAN I'M STILL ENJOYING EVERY SECOND OF IT 
AND I'VE BEEN DOING SOME VERY NICE SCRIPTS 
BY TONY GROUNDS PARTICULARLY 
THE DINNER PARTY THE DINNER PARTY 
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DIDN'T GO OUT IN YOUR VEST 
I DIDN'T GO OUT IN MY VEST 
YOU'VE GOT CHICKEN NUGGETS AND CHIPS 
I'M EIGHTY THREE I'LL MAKE MYSELF A BIT OF TOAST 
PLEASE DON'T GEORGE 
WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK DAD 
NO HE'S GOING UPSTAIRS AREN'T YOU GEORGE 
I'M ALL RIGHT SON 
I KNOW YOU ARE MATE 
IT IS QUITE A PHYSICALLY DEMANDING JOB 
LEARNING THE LINES FOR A START 
THE RETAKES THE LOCATIONS 
DOES THAT EVER FEEL TOO MUCH 
WELL I THINK IF IT WAS GOING TO FEEL TOO MUCH 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO IN MINDER BECAUSE WE SHOT TEN DAYS PER EPISODE 
BOTH DENNIS AND I WERE USUALLY IN MOST OF THE SCENES 
BUT IT WAS SUCH FUN 
I MEAN WHEN WE STARTED WE HAD AN OLD GREENLINE BUS 
WHICH WAS MAKE UP HAIRDRESSING WARDROBE 
AND PLACES WHERE DENNIS COULD PLAY CARDS WITH HIS MATES 
AFTER THE SECOND SERIES WE SAID WE DON'T WANT THAT ANY MORE WE WANT A WINNEBAGO 
SO VERY KINDLY THEY GAVE US BOTH A WINNEBAGO 
THAT LASTED FOR A FORTNIGHT 
WE GOT SO FED UP WITH GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS TO EACH OTHER SAYING 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
IN THE END WE SAID COULD WE HAVE A BIG WINNEBAGO 
HE'LL HAVE THE FRONT AND I'LL HAVE THE BACK 
THAT'S HOW WE ENDED UP AND THAT WAS WONDERFUL 
AND HE IS HEAVEN TO WORK WITH 
I MEAN I'VE JUST DONE A NEW TRICKS WITH HIM AND HIS NEW GANG 
AND THEY ARE A LOVELY LOT TO WORK WITH 
WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT MINDER LATER BUT I JUST WONDERED BECAUSE 
AS PEOPLE GET OLDER MOST PEOPLE PASSED THE AGE OF FORTY START TO WORRY 
ABOUT MEMORY AND ALL OF THAT 
BUT LINES AND ALL THE REST OF IT THAT HAS NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM FOR YOU 
NO BECAUSE WHEN I WAS DOING MINDER 
I ALWAYS TAPE THE WHOLE SCRIPT 
DOING EVERYBODY'S LINES BUT DOING MINE STRONGER THAN THEIRS 
AND I HAD THAT TAPE IN THE CAR AND 
GOING TO WORK ON THE MONDAY 
I PLAY THE STUFF I KNOW I'M GOING TO DO TODAY 
AND THEN GOING HOME I PLAY THE STUFF I KNOW I AM GOING TO DO TOMORROW 
WHICH MEANS YOU DON'T GET HOME DOG TIRED 
AND HAVE TO SIT DOWN LEARNING LINES 
FASCINATING SO SOMEWHERE THERE ARE TAPES OF YOU 
PLAYING ALL THE PARTS IN EVERY SCRIPT YOU'VE EVER DONE 
I DON'T THINK THERE ARE 
I'VE TAPED OVER ALL OF THEM 
BECAUSE OCCASIONALLY YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN 
AND SOMETHING ELSE COMES THROUGH THAT YOU DID IN BETWEEN 
I MEAN IT'S GOT THE WRONG SCRIPT ON THERE 
BUT NO I FIND THAT WORKS MARVELLOUSLY 
AND I TALKED ABOUT THE LENGTH OF YOUR CAREER 
IF WE GO BACK TO CHILDHOOD 
BORN IN LONDON IN THE MID NINETEEN TWENTIES YOUR ACCENT IS INTERESTING 
BECAUSE IN YOUR ROLES YOU'VE USED A LOT OF COCKNEY 
AND A LOT OF LONDON ACCENTS 
IT IS NOT YOUR NATURAL SPEAKING VOICE 
HOW WOULD YOU HAVE SOUNDED WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP 
WHEN I MET ALISTAIR SIM AND HIS WIFE 
I TALKED LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME 
AND THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD I SAID 
AND 
I USED TO START TELLING THEM A FUNNY STORY 
AND WHEN I GOT TO THE PUNCH LINE THEY'D DO THAT 
AND I SAID WHAT YOU DOING THAT FOR 
WE CAN'T STAND YOUR VOWEL SOUNDS DO SOMETHING ABOUT THEM 
AND I THINK IT WAS A CASE OF 
DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR VOWEL SOUNDS OR GET OUT 
SO I DID SOMETHING ABOUT MY VOWEL SOUNDS 
BUT THANK GOODNESS I DIDN'T LOOSE THE COCKNEY ALTOGETHER IT BECAME VERY USEFUL 
IT MADE YOU A LOT OF MONEY LATER ON REALLY 
BEFORE YOU MET ALISTAIR SIM WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT 
IN CHILDHOOD YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER 
WHAT ARE YOUR MEMORIES OF THEM WHAT WERE THEY LIKE 
THEY WERE WONDERFUL THEY WERE LOVELY 
PARTICULARLY AS I WAS ADOPTED BY THEM 
NO THEY WERE MARVELLOUS 
EXCEPT 
WHEN I WENT AWAY ON THE FIRST JOB WHICH WAS WHITE HORSE INN 
I SENT MY PARENTS A TELEGRAM SAYING 
GONE ON STAGE WILL WRITE 
NINE WORDS FOR SIXPENCE IN THOSE DAYS AND I WAS ABOUT THAT SIZE 
WITH PRETTY DARK CURLY HAIR 
AND PEOPLE SAID YEARS LATER WHAT WONDERFUL PARENTS YOU MUST HAVE HAD 
EXCUSE ME 
AND I THOUGHT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT 
WHY DIDN'T THEY COME AFTER ME OR GO TO THE POLICE OR SOMETHING 
BUT NO I DIDN'T SEE THEM FOR SIX MONTHS 
BUT NO THEY WERE WONDERFUL IN THAT THEY ALLOWED IT TO HAPPEN 
HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU FOUND OUT YOU WERE ADOPTED 
THIRTEEN 
IT'S TRAUMATIC FOR SOME PEOPLE WAS IT FOR YOU 
NO IT WASN'T IT WAS INTERESTING 
AND I MEAN THE PROBLEM WAS TO BE GUILTY 
BECAUSE I FOUND A LETTER ON TOP OF THE WARDROBE 
WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS 
AND I SAID WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT 
AND MY MOTHER DIDN'T HESITATE TO TELL ME WHICH WAS VERY NICE 
AND I MEAN THEY'D GIVEN ME A LOVELY CHILDHOOD 
BECAUSE THEY ADOPTED ME WHEN I WAS TEN DAYS OLD 
SO THEY WERE GOOD 
THESE DAYS IT'S EASIES BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET AND VARIOUS AGENCIES 
BUT ADOPTED CHILDREN VERY OFTEN TRACE THEIR PARENTS 
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR NATURAL PARENTS NO NOTHING AT ALL 
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ADOPTION SOCIETY IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE 
IN FACT IF I'D WAITED ANOTHER YEAR THERE WAS AN ADOPTION SOCIETY 
SO I'D KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT THEM 
AND SO THERE WAS SIMPLY NO WAY OF TRACING THEM NO 
YOU REGRET THAT I ASSUME NO 
YOU DON'T NO 
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN CURIOUS I WAS CURIOUS IN MY TEENS 
BUT I THOUGHT SUDDENLY YOU KNOW WHAT AM I DOING THIS FOR 
I'VE GOT TWO PARENTS WHO ARE VERY NICE AND I LOVE VERY MUCH 
I DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT WHERE I'VE COME FROM 
BECAUSE ENVIRONMENT CAN CHANGE HEREDITY IN MY OPINION 
AND I WAS VERY HAPPY 
YOU WERE A PROFESSIONAL ACTOR VERY YOUNG WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT 
BUT WHAT HAD YOU DONE BEFORE THAT WHAT HAD MADE YOU WANT TO ACT 
I WAS IN SCHOOL PLAYS 
AND ALSO MY MOTHER PLAYED THE PIANO AND MY FATHER PLAYED THE DRUMS 
AND WE DID BRITISH LEGION CONCERTS AND I DID COMIC SONGS 
I ALSO DID COMIC SONGS AT THE END OF TERM'S SCHOOL SHOW 
AND GOT INTO TROUBLE WITH THE HEADMASTER 
FOR DOING WHEN I'M CLEANING WINDOWS 
AH WHICH WAS REGARDED AS QUITE A SAUCY SONG AT THE TIME OH VERY SAUCY YES 
AND WAS IT A FORMBY IMPERSONATION 
NO NO NO NO I COULDN'T IMPERSONATE ANYONE IN THOSE DAYS 
BUT LUCKILY PRACTICALLY EVERYONE ELSE HAD THE SAME ACCENT AS I HAD 
AND THEY UNDERSTOOD ME 
SO HOW HAD YOU CHOSEN THAT SONG YOU'D HEARD IT 
I'D HEARD IT I LEARNED IT I LIKED IT 
AND WHEN THE SCHOOL CONCERT CAME UP I THOUGHT WELL I'LL DO IT 
SO I DID 
APART FROM THE ACTING WERE YOU A GOOD STUDENT AT SCHOOL 
YES I WAS 
I WAS IN A SECONDARY SCHOOL A COUNCIL SECONDARY SCHOOL 
AND RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH 
I WAS IN THE FIRST THREE IN THE CLASS 
EITHER FIRST SECOND OR THIRD MOSTLY SECOND AND THIRD 
BECAUSE THERE WAS A SWAT HE ALWAYS CAME FIRST 
LEAVING SCHOOL AT FOURTEEN WHICH WAS ALLOWED AT THAT TIME 
BUT YOU HAD TO HAVE PERMISSION FROM THE SCHOOL TO GO 
YES WHEN YOU LEFT SCHOOL IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AT FOURTEEN 
THE DAY YOU LEFT WHICH WAS USUALLY A FRIDAY 
YOU HAD TO GO UP TO THE HEADMASTER'S STUDY 
AND MEET SOMEONE FROM THE BOARD OF TRADE 
WHO SAID WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO 
AND IF YOU SAID I WANT TO BE AN APPRENTICE ENGINEER 
HE'D SAY RIGHT YOU GO TO THIS FIRM ON MONDAY MORNING 
AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A JOB 
THEN I COME UP THEY SAID WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO I SAID I WANT TO BE AN ACTOR 
HE SAID GET TO THE BACK OF THE QUEUE 
SO I GOT TO THE BACK OF THE QUEUE 
BY THE TIME I GOT UP AGAIN I DIDN'T EVEN GET A CHANCE TO SAY ANYTHING I WAS JUST HANDED A CARD 
THEY SAID THAT IS A BUTCHER'S IN MORDEN BE THERE EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTEEN ON MONDAY MORNING 
THEY WANT A BOY WHO CAN RIDE A CYCLE AS A DELIVERY BOY 
SO I THOUGHT OOH I DON'T LIKE THAT IDEA THAT VERY MUCH 
SO AFTER SCHOOL I WAS SELLING PAPERS AROUND THE STREETS IN MORDEN 
AND SUDDENLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAR 
WAS AN ADVERTISEMENT SMALL BOY WANTED FOR LONDON MUSICAL 
APPLY HELVETIA CLUB GERRARD STREET LONDON 
SO THE NEXT MORNING I WENT UP TO LONDON TO GERRARD STREET 
FOUND THE HELVETIA CLUB 
THOUGHT I WAS IN HEAVEN IT WAS FULL OF CHORUS GIRLS 
I WAS ASKED BY THE PERSON PRODUCING WHAT DO YOU DO FOR AN AUDITION 
AND I CAN STILL HEAR MYSELF SAYING 
I CAN DO FRIENDS ROMANS COUNTRYMEN BY JULIUS CAESAR 
AND I THINK THEY SAID SORRY COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN 
ANYWAY I ENDED UP DOING THAT 
I DIDN'T GET THE PART BUT I GOT THE UNDERSTUDY 
AND I ALSO HAD TO GO ACROSS THE STAGE EVERY NIGHT 
WITH TWO GOATS AND SIX PIGEONS AND WHEN WE WERE ON TOUR 
I HAD TO SHARE A DRESSING ROOM WITH THEM AS WELL 
AND ALL THOSE DECISIONS TO LEAVE SCHOOL AT FOURTEEN 
TO GO OFF AND AUDITION FOR THE MUSICAL 
DID YOU TELL YOUR PARENTS ABOUT ALL THAT OR JUST DO IT YOURSELF 
I JUST WENT 
NO I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GO AND THEN COME BACK THE SAME DAY 
I DIDN'T REALISE I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GO OFF ON A TRAIN TO BLACKPOOL 
WHICH I HAD TO 
BUT YOUR PARENTS WERE HAPPY FOR YOU TO LEAVE SCHOOL YES YES 
WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE WANTED YOU TO DO 
ERM WELL THEY'D PROBABLY HAVE BEEN QUITE HAPPY 
IF I'D TAKEN THE JOB AT THE BUTCHER'S IN MORDEN 
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE ANOTHER WAGE COMING IN 
BUT NO I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT 
AND IN FACT I THINK I GOT TWENTY EIGHT AND SIX A WEEK 
AND ONE POUND PAID FOR MY DIGS 
AND I SENT HOME A FIVE SHILLING POSTAL ORDER 
WHICH ALWAYS CAME BACK IN THE FORM OF A BOX WITH A CAKE AND SWEETS 
AND GOD KNOWS WHAT ALL IN IT 
AND THEY SEEMED QUITE HAPPY AND I WAS QUITE HAPPY 
ANYWAY I GOT THERE AND WENT ON TOUR 
THEN CAME IN TO THE LONDON COLISEUM 
AND ONE DAY OUR CHAPERONE WHO WAS 
THE BOY I WAS UNDERSTUDYING HIS MOTHER WAS OUR CHAPERONE 
AND SHE SAID CHARLES IS GOING FOR AN AUDITION AT THE STRAND THEATRE ON WHATEVER IT WAS 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME ALONG AND WATCH 
BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE ONE OR TWO FAMOUS PEOPLE THERE 
I SAID YES I'D LIKE TO DO THAT 
SO I WENT ALONG TO THE STRAND 
THERE WAS NO SCENERY IT WAS BARE STAGE 
AND THE DIRECTOR RICHARD BIRD WAS DOWN IN THE STALLS 
AND THERE WERE THESE BOYS ON THE EDGE OF THE STAGE 
SO I HUNG BACK BY THE EXIT DOOR NOT WANTING TO GET IN THE WAY 
AND SUDDENLY RICHARD BIRD STARTED YELLING AT ME 
DON'T WASTE MY TIME COME ON COME ON 
NO COME ON COME ON COME ON 
THRUST THE SCRIPT IN MY HAND AND SAID READ THAT 
SO I READ IT IT WAS A COCKNEY EVACUEE 
I GOT THE PART 
AND THEN HE SAID YOU HAVE TO GO TO OXFORD 
TODAY 
SO I THOUGHT THAT'S O. K. FINE I'LL GO TO OXFORD I'VE GOT SOME MONEY 
AND THIS WAS A PLAY CALLED COTTAGE TO LET 
YES A WAR TIME THRILLER 
THE VERY FIRST SPY THRILLER OF THE WAR YES 
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TO TELL THEM AT THE COLISEUM I WON'T COME THIS AFTERNOON 
I DON'T KNOW WHO DEALT WITH THE GOATS AND THE PIGEONS 
SO THERE'S A DRESSING ROOM FULL OF ANIMALS YES 
AND I GOT TO OXFORD I THINK IT WAS A SUNDAY 
AND QUITE LATE AND I WAS VERY SMALL 
AND CARRYING MY BIG SUITCASE AROUND WITH ME 
OF COURSE I HADN'T HAD TO WORRY ABOUT DIGS UNTIL NOW 
AND SUDDENLY I'VE GOT TO FIND DIGS FOR MYSELF I'VE GOT NO CHAPERONE 
SO I WENT EVERYWHERE I WENT TO THE POLICE STATION NO ONE COULD HELP ME 
SO I WENT TO THE THEATRE AND FOUND THE STAGE DIRECTOR 
AND I WAS ON THE VERGE OF TEARS 
HE SAID WHAT'S THE MATTER 
I SAID I CAN'T GET NO DIGS I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LIVE 
AT THAT MOMENT THIS RATHER HANDSOME YOUNG MAN CAME IN AND SAID 
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM 
AND JERRY CLIFTON THE STAGE DIRECTOR SAID HE CAN'T FIND DIGS 
SO THIS YOUNG MAN WHO IS PLAYING THE JUVENILE LEAD SAID 
WELL YOU GO AND FIND HIM SOME DIGS 
I'LL TAKE HIM OVER TO THE WELSH PONY AND GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO EAT 
SO HE TOOK ME OVER TO THE WELSH PONY 
AND THIS WAS YOU KNOW RATIONING TIME 
ORDERED TWO MIXED GRILLS TIPPED THEM ONTO ONE PLATE 
AND SAID GET THAT INSIDE YOU AND WENT BACK TO THE THEATRE 
ON THE MONDAY WE START REHEARSING 
AND THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS PLAYING THE JUVENILE LEAD DIDN'T APPEAR 
AND APPARENTLY HE'D BEEN CALLED UP SO I NEVER SAW HIM 
WELL ROLL FORWARD THIRTY YEARS 
I'M SITTING IN THE M. G. M. STUDIOS IN ELSTREE 
AND A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN COMES OVER 
AND SAYS IS THAT THE YOUNG BOY I GAVE TWO MIXED GRILLS TO 
I SAID YES IT WAS STEWART GRANGER 
AND WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM I SAID 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY 
HOW HE RECOGNISED ME I DON'T KNOW 
BECAUSE I HAD TAKEN OVER FROM AN ACTOR WHO HAD DIED 
AND I WAS WEARING A VERY GREY WIG 
BUT SOMEONE MUST HAVE TOLD HIM 
AND IT IS QUITE UNUSUAL NOW 
BUT THERE WAS A MUCH CLOSER LINK BETWEEN STAGE PLAYS AND FILMS 
SUCCESSFUL PLAYS WERE FILMED QUICKLY 
AND THAT BEGAN YOUR FILM CAREER IN WITH COTTAGE TO LET NINETEEN FORTY ONE 
AND THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT 
IS THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU MET YOUR GREAT MENTOR ALISTAIR SIM 
YES YES IN FACT I MET HIM IN THE PLAY AND 
THE BLITZ STARTED AND ALISTAIR'S WIFE WAS PREGNANT 
AND SO THEY USED TO LIVE IN HAMPSTEAD 
AND THEY MOVED OUT TO THE COUNTRY 
ALISTAIR WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT I WAS LIVING IN LONDON WITH MY MOTHER 
HE SAID YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF LONDON GET SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY 
SO WE'RE GOING TO EVACUATE YOU AND YOUR MOTHER 
WHICH THEY DID VERY KINDLY TO A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY 
IT WAS VERY ODD BECAUSE THE BLITZ SETTLED DOWN 
EVERYTHING HAD CLOSED IT HAD SETTLED DOWN AND EVERYTHING OPENED AGAIN 
MY MOTHER COULDN'T STAND THE QUIET OF THE COUNTRY SHE'D RATHER HAVE THE BOMBS 
SO SHE WENT BACK TO LONDON AND WE TOOK THE PLAY COTTAGE TO LET 
AROUND ALL THE ARMY CAMPS 
AND BY THIS TIME THERE WAS A VERY ODD ATMOSPHERE ABOUT THE BLITZ 
BECAUSE PEOPLE WANTED TO COME BACK IN 
SO WE WENT BACK IN TO WYNDHAM HAVING RUN THERE FOR NINE MONTHS 
WE NOW WENT BACK IN AGAIN AND RAN I THINK FOR ANOTHER NINE MONTHS 
AND THAT'S WHEN I MET ALISTAIR AND NAOMI 
AND GOT THE FILM 
AND THERE WAS A PRESS STORY ABOUT HOW THEY HAD ADOPTED ME 
WHICH I FOUND RATHER ODD BECAUSE I WAS ALREADY ADOPTED YOU CAN'T ADOPT TWICE 
AND MY STORY WHICH IS THE RIGHT ONE 
IS THAT I ADOPTED THEM AND FIFTY YEARS LATER 
THEY SPENT THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS TRYING TO GET RID OF ME 
WHICH WAS RATHER DIFFICULT BECAUSE I HAD BUILT MY HOUSE NEXT TO THEIRS IN THE COUNTRY 
SO IT WAS WONDERFUL 
BUT DID YOU EVER KNOW WHAT WAS IT 
HE SAW SOMETHING IN YOU AS AN ACTOR OR WHAT WAS IT 
THAT HE TOOK YOU UNDER HIS WING IN THAT WAY SO EARLY ON 
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WAS BOTH OF THEM NAOMI AS WELL 
THEY FELT THAT IF I WAS GOING TO GO ON BEING AN ACTOR 
I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE COCKNEY ACCENT 
OR YOU'LL BE A COCKNEY ACTOR FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE 
AND THEY HAD BEAUTIFULLY MODULATED VOWELS THEM BEING SCOTS 
YOU WORKED WITH THEM A LOT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT 
BUT WOULD HE GIVE YOU FORMAL ADVICE 
WOULD HE SAY THIS IS THE WAY TO DO IT TRY THIS DON'T DO THAT 
NO NO 
HE HE WAS QUITE HARSH 
AND HE WOULD SAY THINKS LIKE 
HE WAS A WONDERFUL STAGE DIRECTOR BUT HE WOULD BE IN THE STALLS 
AND I'D BE ON AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD BE ON 
AND HE'D SUDDENLY SAY GEORGIE JUST MOVE A BIT MORE TO THE RIGHT 
A LITTLE BIT MORE THAT'S RIGHT NOW I CAN'T SEE YOU AT ALL 
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU BEGAN TO REALISE 
THAT YOU'VE GOT TO START WATCHING AND SEEING WHAT HAD TO HAPPEN 
BUT NO HE WAS VERY GOOD 
AND HE WORKED IN A WONDERFUL WAY BECAUSE EVERY PLAY HE DID 
HE PUT HIS OWN MONEY IN 
AND HE INSISTED ON HE DIDN'T MIND REHEARSING IN A ROOM FOR THREE WEEKS 
BUT FOR THE FOURTH WEEK HE WANTED A THEATRE A STAGE 
THE SET UP AND ALL THE PROPS 
SO BY THE END OF THE FOURTH WEEK YOU'D RUN THE PLAY FOR A WEEK 
IT WAS WONDERFUL 
YOU TALK ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE BLITZ COMING AND GOING 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A STRANGE TIME BECAUSE YOU WERE IN PLAYS MUSICALS 
BUT THERE WAS FEAR PRESUMABLY 
YOU KNEW THAT THINGS WERE LIKELY TO GO BAD 
YES ERM IT WAS VERY ODD 
BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE AT WYNDHAMS WHEN THE BLITZ STARTED 
WE ALL WENT UP ON THE ROOF TO WATCH 
AND THEN WE DID THE FILM AT SHEPHERD'S BUSH STUDIOS LIME GROVE 
AND WE SLEPT IN THE STUDIO 
BUT AGAIN WE WENT UP ON THE ROOF AT NIGHT AND WATCHED IT 
TOTAL MADNESS 
BUT IT WAS A GREAT ATMOSPHERE THEN 
AND YOUNG ACTORS OFTEN AREN'T FRIGHTENED 
THEY DON'T GET STAGE FRIGHT BUT WERE YOU EVER NERVOUS 
AS AN ACTOR STARTING SO YOUNG NO BECAUSE 
I WAS PLAYING A COCKNEY EVACUEE WHO SWORE 
AND I WAS GETTING PAID FOR IT SO THERE WAS NO FEAR AT ALL 
I THINK THE ONLY TIME I HAD A FRIGHTENING MOMENT WAS 
WE WERE PLAYING CARDIFF AND TOWARDS THE END OF THE PLAY 
I THINK IT WAS IN THE THIRD ACT IN THE INTERVAL 
I HAVE TO GET INTO A BIG BLANKET BOX ON THE STAGE 
AND AT A VITAL MOMENT SUDDENLY BANG THE LID UP JUMP UP AND RUN OFF 
AND WHILE I WAS IN THE BLANKET BOX 
THEY DROPPED A BOMB VERY CLOSE TO THE NEW THEATRE CARDIFF 
AND I WONDERED SHOULD I GET OUT NOW 
BUT NO LIKE THE GOOD BOY I WAS 
I STAYED THERE UNTIL MY CUE CAME AND THEN I WAS OUT AND AWAY 
AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT YOU'D HAD A CHAPERONE 
WAS TO KEEP YOU AWAY FROM YOUNG THEATRICAL LADIES 
BUT ONCE YOU DIDN'T HAVE ONE WAS THAT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY 
I MEAN WERE YOU SURROUNDED BY YOUNG WOMEN 
WHILE I WAS IN WHITE HORSE INN I WAS SURROUNDED BY YOUNG WOMEN 
I MEAN PREMATURELY DEVELOPED LITTLE GIRLS OF FOURTEEN 
AND BEAUTIFULLY DEVELOPED YOUNG LADIES 
WHO I THOUGHT WERE AT LEAST THIRTY AND I FOUND OUT LATER WERE EIGHTEEN 
BUT THEY WERE MARVELLOUS 
AND THEN AS THE WAR DEVELOPED 
THERE WAS THE PROSPECT OF BEING CALLED UP PRESUMABLY YES 
I WAS CALLED UP WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN IN THE R. A. F. 
AND I WAS IN FOR FOUR YEARS 
WAS GIVEN THE CHANCE OF PLAYING JIM HAWKINS IN TREASURE ISLAND 
AND I WANTED TO DO THAT 
SO HAVING JOINED THE R. A. F. 
YOU THEN GO BEFORE A BOARD WHO SAY 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO JOIN THE R. A. F. 
AND I SAID WELL I WANT TO PLAY JIM HAWKINS CAN I GET A DEFERMENT 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY I WANT TO FIGHT AND FLY WITH THE R. A. F. 
SO AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO GET OUT AND GO TO THE END OF THE LINE 
BUT THEN I GOT THE RATTIGAN PLAY WHICH WAS FLARE PATH 
AND I GOT THE PART OF BOY IN HENRY V. 
AND I GOT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DEFERMENT FOR THAT 
SO THAT WAS THE LAST THING I DID 
THOSE FILMS WERE CONSIDERED PART OF THE WAR EFFORT 
OH DEFINITELY HENRY V. YES 
BUT I WENT INTO THE R. A. F. AS A BOY AND CAME OUT AS A MAN 
HAVING SHOVELLED COAL AND GOD KNOWS WHAT ALL 
BUT IT WAS GOOD FOR ME 
SO HENRY V. YOU WERE DIRECTED BY OLIVIER YES YES 
HE WAS WONDERFUL I MEAN HE PLAYED EVERYONE'S PART 
BUT NEVER IN A WAY THAT HE WANTED YOU TO DO IT 
IT WAS ALWAYS A WAY OF EXPLAINING TO YOU THIS IS HOW IT COULD BE PLAYED 
HE WOULD TAKE HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND PUT IT ROUND HIS HEAD AND BE THE PERFECT MISTRESS QUICKLY 
AND IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE THE WAY THAT IT ALL WENT 
AND I THINK I HAD ONE LINE THAT WAS A FORERUNNER OF ARTHUR DALEY 
WHICH WAS YOU'LL BE FAMOUS BOY YOU'LL BE FAMOUS 
AND I REMEMBER WALKING OFF SAYING 
FAMOUS I'LL GIVE ALL MY FAME FOR A POT OF ALE AND SAFETY 
AND I THOUGHT THAT IS PURE YOUNG ARTHUR DALEY 
SHOW ME A PUB 
I WONDERED ABOUT THAT DURING THE WAR 
BECAUSE YOU WENT ON TO PLAY A LOT OF SPIVS 
THERE WERE A LOT AROUND DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
DID YOU SEE PEOPLE WHO WERE USEFUL TO YOU LATER 
WHEN YOU PLAYED THOSE ROLES 
SOMEBODY SAID ANOTHER PERFORMER HAD SAID 
THAT I'D PINCHED FLASH HARRY FROM HIM 
AND I MET HIM SOME TIME LATER AND I SAID 
I UNDERSTAND YOU THINK I PINCHED FLASH HARRY FROM YOU 
HE SAID CERTAINLY NOT I SAID YOU'RE WRONG I PINCHED IT FROM SID FIELD 
BUT REALLY HE WAS A CARTOONIST CREATED FLASH HARRY 
BECAUSE THE CARTOON IN THE BOOK WAS HIM LEANING AT FORTY FIVE ANGLE DEGREE 
ROUND A CORNER WITH THE MOUSTACHE AND WITH THE HAT 
SO HE MADE IT ALL FOR YOU 
AND GOING INTO THE R. A. F. BECAUSE PERHAPS SURPRISING TO YOU 
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THEIR FORTIES FIFTIES NOW WHO'VE NEVER BEEN SENT TO WAR 
SO YOU'RE THE LAST GENERATION THAT REALLY HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE 
BUT WERE YOU FRIGHTENED WHEN YOU WERE SENT 
ERM WELL I DON'T THINK I CAN SAY I WAS SENT TO WAR 
BECAUSE 
I TRAINED TO BE A WIRELESS OPERATOR 
AND I DIDN'T DO WELL WITH THE MORSE 
I COULDN'T LEARN IT COS I WASN'T BEING PAID ENOUGH 
AND SO I BECAME WHAT WAS KNOWN AS ACHGD AIRCRAFT HAND GENERAL DUTIES 
SO I DID MY SQUARE BASHING THEN I WENT TO BLACKPOOL 
AND BECAUSE I COULDN'T DO THE MORSE I HAD THE JOB CLEANING OUT 
THE ERM WINTER GARDEN 
AND THEN 
I WAS ON PARADE ONE DAY AND THE SERGEANT SAID 
COME OUT HERE BASIL RATHBONE 
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE MEANT 
AND THEN HE MADE IT VERY CLEAR WHO HE MEANT 
AND I HAD BEEN TOLD THAT I HAD GOT TO COME DOWN TO PINEWOOD FOR AN R. A. F. FILM 
CALLED JOURNEY TOGETHER 
SO I CAME DOWN FOR THAT AND UNLIKE ALL THE OTHER ACTORS 
LIKE DICKEY ATTENBOROUGH AND JACK WATLING EDWARD G. ROBINSON 
WHO ALL WENT HOME IN THE EVENING IN LONDON 
I WAS MADE TO GO BACK TO COASTAL COMMAND WHERE I WAS SHOVELLING COAL 
AS SOON AS THE DAY HAD FINISHED 
SO THE ACTING IN FACT SAVED YOU 
FROM BEING SENT INTO CONFLICT PROBABLY 
ERM I THINK SO YES 
I MEAN I'M VIRTUALLY BLIND IN MY LEFT EYE SO THAT DIDN'T HELP 
AND I DID HAVE TROUBLE TRYING TO LEARN DOT DOT DASH AND ALL THAT 
BUT 
I ENDED UP RUNNING A BAR IN COASTAL COMMAND HEADQUARTERS 
THEN I WAS POSTED TO GERMANY WHERE I WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF ANOTHER BAR 
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID UNTIL THE END OF THE WAR 
SO I CAN'T SAY I WAS IN THE WAR 
AND THEN PRETTY SOON AFTER THE WAR THE ACTING CAREER RESUMED 
YES WHEN I CAME OUT I HAD A BRIDIE PLAY WITH ALISTAIR SIM 
DOCTOR ANGELUS 
AND THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND THAT WAS VERY GOOD 
BECAUSE SUDDENLY I WAS PLAYING AN ADULT 
I'D GONE INTO THE R. A. F. WEARING SHORT TROUSERS 
AND COME OUT A MAN 
SO THAT SAVED ME TRYING TO GET OVER FROM ONE TO THE OTHER 
WHEN DID YOUR ACCENT CHANGE WHEN DID THE SIMS' 
IT HAD TO CHANGE FOR DOCTOR ANGELUS 
BUT I THINK IT HAD CHANGED BEFORE THEN 
I'D REALISED IT HAD GOT TO AND I THINK I MADE SURE IT DID 
AND SO YOU JUST CONSCIOUSLY YOU JUST DID IT YOURSELF 
YOU CHANGED THE WAY YOU SPOKE YES 
PLUS THE FACT THAT GETTING INSULTED ALL THE TIME BY ALISTAIR 
AND YOU DID MANY FILMS WITH ALISTAIR SIM 
BUT THE BIGGEST WERE I SUPPOSE SCROOGE 
AND THEN THE SAINT TRINIAN'S FILMS YES YES 
YES I MEAN COTTAGE TO LET 
SCROOGE ERM THE GREEN MAN 
HE WAS IN I THINK TWO OF THE SAINT TRINIAN'S FILMS 
HE WASN'T IN ALL FOUR 
WOULD HE GIVE YOU ADVICE ON FILM SETS 
AND WERE YOU CONSCIOUS OF GETTING BETTER AS AN ACTOR DEVELOPING YES 
YOU WOULD PLAY A SCENE 
THERE'S A SCENE IN THE GREEN MAN I REMEMBER 
AND HE SUDDENLY SAID TO ME 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT LIKE THAT I'M GOING TO TAKE IT 
AND I THOUGHT WHAT DOES HE MEAN 
AND SO I THOUGHT 
AND THE NEXT TIME I DID IT IT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT 
AND HE SAID GOOD BOY 
SO I GOT THE MESSAGE 
SO WHAT DID HE MEAN BY TAKE IT 
HE'D HAVE TO CONTROL IT IF I WAS GOING TO BE LACKING ENERGY 
WHICH IS WHAT I THINK HE MEANT HE'D HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
I GOT THE MESSAGE AND IT ENDED UP BEING A LOVELY SCENE 
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US GOING MAD TRYING TO DIAL NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
AND WHEN YOU WERE OFFERED THE FIRST SAINT TRINIAN'S 
DID YOU REALISE STRAIGHTAWAY THAT THAT WAS A VERY ATTRACTIVE CHARACTER TO PLAY 
YES YES 
I HAD A THEORY THAT FLASH HARRY WAS CONCEIVED 
IN THE BUSHES IN THAT SCHOOL 
AND HAD NEVER BEEN OUT IN THE WIDE WIDE WORLD 
BUT NO IT WAS LOVELY REALLY WONDERFUL TO PLAY IT 
AND THERE WAS A REAL BRITISH FILM INDUSTRY AT THAT STAGE 
BUT WERE YOU TREATED GRANDLY AS AN ACTOR WHAT WAS IT LIKE 
NO I WASN'T TREATED GRANDLY WASN'T PAID MUCH EITHER 
I THINK THE COMBINATION OF THE SAINT TRINIAN'S FILMS 
WHICH WERE IN THE NINETEEN FIFTY'S AND THE RADIO SERIES A LIFE OF BLISS 
WHICH IS ABOUT THE SAME TIME COMBINED TO GET ME RECOGNISED 
YOU WERE PLAYING A YOUNG MAN CALLED DAVID ALEXANDER BLISS 
BARRY TOOK HAS WRITTEN IN HIS BOOK ABOUT THE RECORDINGS OF THAT SERIES 
WHICH SOUND QUITE EXTRAORDINARY 
BECAUSE THE WRITER WAS RATHER CHAOTIC AND DISORGANISED 
AND TENDED NOT TO HAVE FINISHED THE SCRIPT BY THE TIME OF THE RECORDING 
THAT'S RIGHT IT USED TO START OFF VERY WELL 
THE B. B. C. WOULD SAY RIGHT WE WANT FOUR SCRIPTS BEFORE WE START 
SO THEY'D GET FOUR SCRIPTS BUT OF COURSE WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO FIVE 
HE'D ONLY WRITTEN TEN PAGES SO WE HAD TO COME IN 
WE WERE EITHER AT THE ODEON HALL OR PLAYHOUSE THEATRE AND GO ON STAGE 
START THE SHOW WITH AN AUDIENCE 
AND THEN SUDDENLY I WOULD BE HANDED UP PAGES 
WHICH I HADN'T EVEN SEEN BUT I HAD TO CARRY ON RECORDING 
AND THEN WE HAD ONE VERY BAD TIME 
WHEN WE WERE ALL STILL THERE AT MIDNIGHT 
AND HE WAS DOWNSTAIRS WRITING THE SCRIPT 
AND THE AUDIENCE HAD GONE 
AND I USED TO GO DOWN AND SEE HOW HE WAS GETTING ON 
AND HE WAS 
AND THEN HE'D PICK UP AN EMPTY WATER JUG 
FILL AN EMPTY GLASS WITH NOTHING DRINK IT 
AND SAY I MUST GO TO THE LOO 
AND THEN HE'D COME BACK 
AND DO ANOTHER PAGE 
OH 
AND BARRY TOOK SAYS IN THE BOOK THAT THE WRITER GODFREY HARRISON 
THAT HIS WIFE WOULD BE THERE FRANTICALLY TRYING TO ENCOURAGE HIM 
TO WRITE MORE PAGES YES YEAH 
WE HAD ONE ACTRESS I CAN'T REMEMBER HER NAME 
WHO AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK SAID 
NO I'VE GOT PEOPLE COMING FOR SUPPER I'M GOING GOODBYE 
SO THAT MEANT WHAT WE'D ALREADY DONE HAD GOT TO BE ADAPTED AS WE WENT ON 
BUT IT WAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL SERIES 
YOU KNOW IT'S TIME YOU SETTLED DOWN AND HAD A FAMILY POPPET 
WE MUST THINK OF SOME NICE GIRL FOR YOU 
DON'T YOU START I HAD ENOUGH OF THAT WITH MRS. GRIFFIN 
I WASN'T SERIOUS I KNOW YOU WEREN'T 
I KNOW WHO'D BE PERFECT FOR YOU PAULINE MASSEY 
PAULINE MASSEY YOU MUST HAVE MET HER HELEN MASSEY'S SISTER 
ABOUT TWENTY FOUR AND AWFULLY PRETTY SHE'S THE PERFECT WIFE FOR YOU 
WILL I BE ALLOWED TO SEE HER BEFORE I DECIDE 
YES OF COURSE 
YOU DID THAT ON TELEVISION AS WELL YES I THINK WE ONLY DID ONE SERIES 
BECAUSE WE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM 
WE WERE ON AIR IN AN HOUR'S TIME 
AND THERE'S STILL ANOTHER SIX PAGES TO COME 
AND YOU WERE DOING MORE AND MORE T. V. 
AND A MAN OF OUR TIMES AS WELL IN THE SIXTIES 
BUT YOU WERE COMING TO BE REGARDED AS A COMIC ACTOR 
WAS THAT WHAT YOU'D ALWAYS WANTED TO DO WAS THAT HOW YOU SAW YOURSELF 
NO WELL I SAW MYSELF IN DAVID BLISS AS A LIGHT COMEDY ACTOR 
AND I SAW MYSELF IN THE SAINT TRINIAN'S AS A BROAD COMEDY ACTOR 
AND THEN JULIAN BOND CREATED A MAN OF OUR TIMES 
AND THAT WAS A WONDERFUL PART IN 
IT WAS THIRTEEN EPISODES IN A REAL TIME SCHEME 
IN THAT IN THE FIRST EPISODE HE WAS GOING TO BE MADE REDUNDANT 
AND THIS WAS A YEAR IN WHICH REDUNDANCY BECAME A WORD EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD 
WHEREAS THEY PROBABLY HADN'T BEFORE 
AND HE WAS GIVEN THREE MONTHS TO MAKE UP HIS MIND 
EITHER TO TAKE REDUNDANCY OR GO AND WORK IN AUSTRALIA 
AND IT WAS VERY TIMELY BECAUSE WE WERE DEALING WITH STRIKES 
AND WE WERE DEALING IN THE SERIES WITH A STRIKE 
THESE LABELS PEOPLE USE FOR ACTORS 
BECAUSE OFTEN PEOPLE WOULD DESCRIBE YOU AS A CHARACTER ACTOR 
WHEREAS IN FACT ALL ACTORS PLAY CHARACTERS SO IT ALWAYS SEEMS STRANGE TO ME 
DO THEY HAVE ANY MEANING FOR YOU THOSE SORT OF LABELS 
I THINK I GOT MY FIRST ADULT REVIEW 
IN A FILM CALLED MY BROTHER'S KEEPER 
IN WHICH I WAS HANDCUFFED TO JACK WARNER TWO ESCAPED CONVICTS 
AND THE REVIEW IN EITHER PICTURE SHOW OR PICTURE GOER SAID 
THIS YOUNG MAN HAS A NAME I WOULDN'T WISH ON A HOUSE PAINTER 
AND A FACE THAT MAKES BELA LUGOSI LOOK PRETTY 
IT WAS SIGNED B. F. NOW THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BRYAN FORBES 
BUT IT PROBABLY WASN'T 
HAVE YOU EVER ASKED BRYAN FORBES 
NO 
WERE YOU HURT BY THAT REVIEW NO 
I MEAN YOU CAN'T HURT ME AFTER THAT 
BECAUSE I KNOW I'M NOT AS UGLY AS BELA LUGOSI 
AND I DON'T CARE WHAT HOUSE PAINTERS THINK ABOUT MY NAME EXACTLY 
AMAZING SNOBBERY THAT TO PICK ON A NAME YES 
I SUPPOSE WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO SAY BUT IN A RATHER RUDE WAY 
WAS THAT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO GET ROMANTIC LEADS 
SO THAT'S WHAT THEY MEAN BY CHARACTER ACTING 
YES I THINK THEY MEAN YOU'RE NOT VERY PRETTY 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY MEAN THE STAGE ACTING YOU KEPT GOING 
I MEAN QUITE MAJOR ROLES 
FOR EXAMPLE CHRISTOPHER HAMPTON'S THE PHILANTHROPIST 
WHICH YOU DID FOR TWO YEARS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY'S 
AND THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR ACTING RANGE 
BECAUSE YOU WERE PLAYING AN ACADEMIC 
YEAH I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST PLAYS THAT'S BEEN WRITTEN 
IN MY LIFETIME ANYWAY 
AND IT WAS A MISTAKE TO STAY IN IT FOR TWO YEARS 
BUT AFTER THE FIRST YEAR 
MICHAEL CODRON PUT MY SALARY UP 
IF I'D STAY FOR ANOTHER YEAR WHICH I DID 
BUT IT BECAME A NIGHTMARE TOWARDS THE END 
BECAUSE I WOULD DRIVE UP TO LONDON 
AND FIND MYSELF GOING INTO LONDON AIRPORT 
FOR NO GOOD REASON 
BUT I OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE THEATRE 
AND YOUR CONCENTRATION WAS PAPER THIN 
I MEAN INSTEAD OF IT BEING STRONGER THE LONGER YOU PLAYED IT 
IT WENT THE OTHER WAY 
AND WE WERE AT THE MAYFAIR THEATRE 
AND YOU HAD TO COME OUT OF THE THEATRE THROUGH THE FRONT OF HOUSE 
THERE WAS NO STAGE DOOR 
AND I CAME OUT ONE DAY AND SOME PEOPLE WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING 
AND I SAID WHAT HAVE YOU LOST 
AND THEY SAID GLASSES OR A LIGHTER OR SOMETHING 
SO I SAID I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT'S FOUR ROWS FURTHER FORWARD 
BECAUSE I'D HEARD IT ROLL DOWN 
THAT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT YOU YOU CAN'T KEEP IT UP THAT LONG 
RIGHT THROUGH YOUR CAREER YOU'VE KEPT THE STAGE ACTING GOING 
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ONCE THEY GET FILM AND T. V. 
THINK I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS KEPT BOTH 
YES I'M NOT SO SURE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE IN A. 
THE CHANCE WOULD BE A FINE THING BE IN A LONG RUN IN LONDON 
BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN DRIVING FIVE HUNDRED MILES A WEEK 
AND THAT'S THE BIT I DON'T LIKE 
SO I'M VERY HAPPY TO DO PLAYS AT PLACES LIKE WINDSOR 
WHICH IS A LOVELY THEATRE 
AND I'VE DONE SEVERAL PLAYS THERE WITH MY WIFE 
AND AS FAR AS TOURING IS CONCERNED 
I'M QUITE HAPPY TO DO THE HOME COUNTIES 
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO MUCH FURTHER BECAUSE I LIKE TO GET HOME AT NIGHT 
ALSO IN SOMETHING LIKE THE PHILANTHROPIST 
YOU GOT THE BENEFIT OF WHAT THE SIMS HAD DONE FOR YOU 
BECAUSE THAT WAS A POSH ROLE WASN'T IT ABSOLUTELY YES 
SO IT'S BEEN VERY USEFUL TO YOU TO HAVE BOTH VOICES THE COCKNEY AND THE POSH 
YES AND NOT TO LOSE THE COCKNEY BECAUSE I'VE NEEDED IT 
AND TO GET AWAY WITH THE POSH 
THE COCKNEY IS VERY IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLES OF YOUR CAREER 
ARTHUR DALEY YOU WERE PRESUMABLY SENT ONE SCRIPT WERE YOU 
NO I WASN'T SENT A SCRIPT 
I WAS WHAT WAS I DOING 
I WAS DOING BRIMSTONE AND TREACLE DENNIS POTTER PLAY YES 
IT HAD BEEN BANNED FROM T. V. A VERY HARSH PLAY 
YEAH I USED TO SAY TO MY WIFE AS I WENT OFF TO THE THEATRE 
I'M GOING UP TO LONDON TO SPEND TWO HOURS ARGUING WITH MY WIFE 
IT WAS AWFUL 
AND SO SUDDENLY I GOT A MESSAGE 
WOULD I MEET LLOYD GEORGE TAYLOR AND LLOYD 
YEAH WHAT'S HIS NAME EUSTON FILMS 
YES ANYWAY I GOT A MESSAGE TO MEET THEM 
AT A HOTEL IN I THINK GERMAN STREET 
AND I SAID I CAN'T I'VE GOT TO DO THIS PLAY 
AND THEN THEY CAME BACK AGAIN AND SAID JUST COME AND HAVE A DRINK 
SO I THOUGHT ALL RIGHT AND I SAID THROUGH MY AGENT 
WHY HAVE I GOT TO MEET THEM I'VE DONE ARMCHAIR THEATRE FOR THEM 
AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING THEY KNOW WHAT I CAN DO 
THEY SAID GO AND SEE THEM 
SO ON THE WAY TO THE THEATRE I WENT TO SEE THEM 
AND 
LLOYD SHIRLEY AND GEORGE TAYLOR HANDED ME A FORMAT 
AND SAID READ THAT SO I READ IT AND I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING 
AND THEY SAID WE WANT TO DO A SERIES WITH THAT CHARACTER 
HOW DO YOU FEEL 
I SAID I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL I'M QUITE HAPPY WITH HAVING READ THAT 
AND I THINK IT WAS LLOYD WHO SAID 
DO YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT THE STAMINA FOR IT 
THAT WAS THE FIRST EPISODE OF ONE HUNDRED SEVEN EPISODES SO I MUST HAVE HAD THE STAMINA FOR IT 
BUT IT WAS A JOY TO DO 
WHEN THERE WAS A FIRST SCRIPT 
WHEN YOU LOOKED AT IT DID YOU GET HIM INSTANTLY 
COULD YOU SEE ABSOLUTELY WHEN I READ THE FORMAT IT SAID 
ARTHUR DALEY IS RIGHT BEHIND THE PRESENT HOME SECRETARY 
AS FAR AS LAW AND ORDER IS CONCERNED 
HIS FAVOURITE FILM IS THE GODFATHER 
AND HE DRESSES LIKE A DODGY MEMBER OF THE CITIZEN'S ADVICE BUREAU 
AND I THOUGHT THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME I KNOW EXACTLY WHO THAT MAN IS 
AND I DIDN'T GET A SCRIPT UNTIL WE STARTED 
AND YOU ALSO THOUGHT PRESUMABLY I CAN USE THAT ACCENT 
THAT THE SIMS MADE ME GIVE UP YES 
AND OFTEN IN THESE BIG TELEVISION ROLES 
I MEAN INSPECTOR MORSE IS AN EXAMPLE FOR JOHN THAW 
OR DEL BOY FOR DAVID JASON 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY'RE PART OF A DOUBLE ACT 
THE OTHER ACTOR HAS BEEN IMPORTANT IN THOSE 
NICHOLAS LYNDHURST OR KEVIN WHATELY 
THAT WAS TRUE IN THE CASE OF MINDER WASN'T IT IT WAS CRUCIALLY A DOUBLE ACT 
ABSOLUTELY 
AND IT WAS SUCH FUN TO DO HE IS A LOVELY ACTOR TO WORK WITH 
MAKES VERY GOOD SUGGESTIONS 
AND HE GIVES AS MUCH AS HE GETS WHICH IS GOOD 
WHEN YOU FIRST MET DENNIS HAD YOU WORKED WITH HIM OR KNOWN HIM BEFORE 
WE WERE SITTING IN THE CAR IN MINDER IN THE STREET 
I WAS SITTING IN THE BACK HE WAS IN THE FRONT WITH A GIRL 
AND HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS FILM HE WAS IN CALLED FRIGHT 
AND I SAID YOU WEREN'T IN THAT FILM I WAS IN THAT FILM 
HE SAID YOU WEREN'T AND I SAID I WAS 
IT TURNED OUT THAT I'D ONLY COME INTO THE FILM AFTER HE'D BEEN KILLED 
AND HE WAS LYING FACE DOWN IN THE HALL 
AND I STEPPED OVER HIM 
BUT APART FROM THAT I DID ONE SWEENEY SO I DID KNOW HIM 
AS SOON AS YOU MET IT WORKED AS A COMBINATION 
I THINK WE CIRCLED EACH OTHER FOR ABOUT THREE DAYS 
AND THEN REALISED THAT NEITHER OF US WERE FIGHTING FOR THE BILLING 
AND THAT WE WERE BOTH ENJOYING EACH OTHER'S COMPANY 
AND DID YOU EVER GET SICK OF EACH OTHER NO NO 
BECAUSE HE HAD THE FRONT OF THE WINNEBAGO AND I HAD THE BACK 
AND WE DIDN'T SPEND MUCH OF OUR SPARE TIME TOGETHER 
ONLY AN HOUR FOR LUNCH 
HE WAS A GREAT PUB PERSON AND A GREAT FOOTBALL PERSON 
AND I'M NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS 
AND IF YOU SPENT TWENTY SIX WEEKS TOGETHER 
YOU DON'T SEEK OUT EACH OTHER NECESSARILY WHEN YOU'RE NOT WORKING 
BUT WE GO AND SEE EACH OTHER 
I MEAN HE CAME TO SEE ME IN PARTY PIECE AT WINDSOR 
AND WE WENT TO SEE HIM IN MY FAIR LADY WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
AND PARTY PIECE 
HE CAME AND HE SAID WHERE ARE YOU GOING NEXT WEEK 
I SAID WE'RE IN EASTBOURNE AND AS HE WENT OUT THE STAGE DOOR 
HE SAID NOW YOU BE CAREFUL WATCH OUT FOR THOSE WOMEN IN EASTBOURNE 
AND REMEMBER THEY'RE ALL OLDER THAN YOU 
DID YOU EVER FALL OUT EVER HAVE AN ARGUMENT OVER A SCENE NO NO 
NO WE USED TO MEET IN MAKE UP AND DO ALL OUR CHATTING THERE 
AND WORK OUT THAT SCENE THIS SCENE 
OR WHETHER WE LIKED IT OR WHETHER WE DIDN'T 
AND ALSO WHEN SOMEBODY NEW CAME IN 
WE MADE SURE THEY CAME INTO THE WINNEBAGO 
AND IF THEY HAD A LOT OF TRICKY STUFF WORKED IT THROUGH WITH US 
AND THEY WERE VERY HAPPY WITH THAT 
AND WE HAD ONE LITTLE CAST WHO WERE REALLY LOVELY 
WHEN IT STARTED TO GO OUT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE PRESUMABLY QUITE EARLY ON 
YOU GOT A SENSE THAT IT WAS A HIT THAT IT WAS WORKING NO 
NO FIRST OF ALL IT WAS DELAYED BECAUSE THAMES WENT ON STRIKE OH THAT'S RIGHT 
SO WE ONLY DID ELEVEN AND THEY WENT OUT 
AND THEY WENT OUT IN THE SWEENEY SPOT 
AND WE GOT SOME REACTION BUT NOT VERY MUCH 
BUT WHAT WAS INTERESTING 
AND THIS IS WHAT WAS SO WONDERFUL ABOUT EUSTON FILMS 
BEFORE WE'D FINISHED THE FIRST SERIES 
THEY COMMISSIONED A SECOND ONE 
WHICH WOULD NEVER HAPPEN NOW WOULD IT 
NO YOU WOULDN'T GET IT 
YOU'D GET TO NUMBER SIX PROBABLY 
AND THEY'D SAY YOU'RE NOT GETTING FIFTEEN MILLION VIEWERS SO GOODBYE 
AND THE NEXT SERIES WE DID THIRTEEN 
AND WE STILL DIDN'T GET IN THE RATINGS 
BUT THE THIRD SERIES WE SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE RATINGS 
AND WE WENT VERY VERY HIGH 
AND YOU KNEW SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE TAXI DRIVERS WOULD SAY 
HOW'S HER INDOORS 
OR OTHERS OF THEM WOULD SAY YOU MUST PAY THAT BOY A BIT MORE MONEY 
IT'S NOT FAIR 
AND YOU SENSED THEY'D CAUGHT ONTO THE CHARACTERS 
AND FROM THEN ON WE DIDN'T LOOK BACK 
WHEN YOU FIRST DID IT WHAT BECAME THE CATCHPHRASES 
HER INDOORS NICE LITTLE EARNER 
DID YOU REALISE WHEN YOU FIRST SAID THEM THAT THEY WERE NO 
I MEAN HER INDOORS IS NOW IN THE OXFORD DICTIONARY EXTRAORDINARY 
AND PEOPLE WOULD START GIVING YOU A NICE LITTLE EARNER 
YOU'D GET THOSE PHRASES BACK YES ALL THE TIME 
AND PEOPLE TRYING TO SELL ME JAPANESE HAVANA CIGARS 
DID YOU EVER GET IRRITATED BY THAT LEVEL OF ATTENTION 
NO FROM PEOPLE 
NO THE ONE THING I LEARNED VERY QUICKLY 
YOU CAN'T DO WINDOW SHOPPING OTHERWISE YOU'LL GET BUTTONHOLED 
AND TOLD THE DETAILS OF THE LAST SIX EPISODES OF MINDER 
SO YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP MOVING THE ONLY TIME IT GOT WORRYING 
IS WHEN YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE MOTORWAY AT SIXTY M. P. H. 
AND SOMEBODY PASSES YOU AT SEVENTY WINDS DOWN THE WINDOW 
AND SAYS HELLO ARTHUR 
THAT'S QUITE WORRYING YOU QUICKLY PULL INTO THE SLOW LANE 
SOME ACTORS ONCE THEY'RE INVOLVED IN A HIT ALTHOUGH IT'S GREAT TO BE IN ONE 
START WORRYING ABOUT HOW LONG TO STAY IN IT 
THERE ARE ACTORS WHO HAVE LEFT SERIES FOR THAT REASON 
BECAUSE THEY FEAR TYPECASTING 
DID YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT BEING IN IT FOR SO LONG NO 
NO I MEAN IF YOU'RE ENJOYING IT AND YOU'RE GETTING GOOD SCRIPTS 
YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT TYPECASTING 
I MEAN IT'S OTHER PEOPLE AND CRITICS THAT WORRY ABOUT TYPECASTING 
BUT AS AN ACTOR AND CERTAINLY AT MY AGE 
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT TYPECASTING JUST GIVE ME THE JOB 
BUT YOU DID MINDER FOR SO LONG AND DENNIS WATERMAN LEFT IT 
AND YOU WENT ON AND HE WAS REPLACED 
DID IT REMAIN AS SATISFYING FOR YOU RIGHT THROUGH 
YES IT DID BUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY 
GARY WEBSTER WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANIMAL TO DENNIS 
BUT I ENJOYED WORKING WITH HIM VERY MUCH 
THAMES LOST THE FRANCHISE AND THAT'S WHY IT FINISHED 
BUT WE CAME IN WITH MRS. THATCHER AND WE OUTSTAYED HER BY FIVE YEARS 
ON THE MRS. THATCHER POINT YOU PROBABLY KNOW 
APART FROM BEING IN THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 
QUITE SERIOUS BOOKS NOW ABOUT BRITISH POLITICS SAY THAT MINDER 
ARTHUR DALEY IT WAS ALL PART OF THE THATCHERITE REVOLUTION 
AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE LIKED IT 
DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT ANY OF THAT 
I ONLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT AFTER WHEN PEOPLE SAID 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT DOING SOME MORE NOW 
AND YOU HAVE TO SAY NO IT'S HAD IT'S TIME 
IT WAS A TIME OF GREED AND HE CERTAINLY WAS A GREEDY MAN 
BUT PEOPLE ENJOYED THAT BECAUSE THEY'D LIKE TO DO THAT 
AND GET AWAY WITH IT 
AND IT'S THE SAME AS DAVID JASON'S DEL BOY 
THEY BELONG TO THAT PERIOD VERY MUCH SEVENTIES EIGHTIES ABSOLUTELY YES 
YOU MENTIONED BEING ASKED TO DO MORE 
HAVE THERE BEEN ATTEMPTS TO BRING IT BACK OVER THE YEARS NO 
PEOPLE HAVE SAID WOULD YOU CONSIDER DOING MORE AND I'VE SAID NO 
YOU WOULD NEVER 
YOU MUST NEVER SAY THAT MUST YOU 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER MINDER 
DID YOU FIND THAT PEOPLE TENDED TO OFFER YOU ARTHUR DALEY TYPE STUFF 
YOU GOT SENT A BIT BUT NOT VERY MUCH 
MOST TIMES IT DIDN'T GET PAST MY AGENT SHE WOULD LOOK AT IT 
AND TELL ME AND SAY SHALL I SEND IT TO YOU 
AND SHE'D GIVE ME AN IDEA ABOUT IT 
AND I'D SAY NO I DON'T THINK SO BUT NO YOU DO 
YOU DID A BUILDING SOCIETY AD 
WHICH WAS A VERSION OF ARTHUR DALEY WASN'T IT NO IT WAS NOT 
WHEN I DID THAT THE I. T. C. OR WHOEVER THEY ARE 
THE REGULATOR AT THE TIME THE WARDENS YES 
SAID WROTE TO MY AGENT AND SAID 
GEORGE COLE IS NOT TO DO THE LEEDS COMMERCIAL 
BECAUSE HE WAS A CHARACTER THAT'S ON I. T. V. AT THE TIME 
AND I SENT BACK A MESSAGE SAYING THAT IS NOT ARTHUR DALEY 
ARTHUR DALEY WOULDN'T BE SEEN DEAD IN THAT SHEEPSKIN COAT 
AND THAT FLAT CAP AND STILL THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA 
BUT IN THE END WE GOT A VERY NICE NOTE SAYING 
ALL RIGHT WE ACCEPT THAT THE LEEDS MAN 
IS A DISTANT RELATIVE OF ARTHUR DALEY 
SO I WAS ALLOWED TO DO IT 
WELL I STARTED RACING GREYHOUNDS NOW 
AND THIS ONE'S NO BEGINNER HE HASN'T LOST A SINGLE RACE 
A DEAD CERT MONEY SPINNER THAT'S WHY I CALL HER HAIRY HOUND 
DID YOU HAVE TO THINK HARD ABOUT WHETHER TO DO ADVERTS 
BECAUSE THAT IS A DECISION ACTORS HAVE TO MAKE 
AGAIN IT COMES DOWN TO SCRIPT 
I MEAN THE FIRST COMMERCIAL I DID WAS FOR HAMLET CIGARS 
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST SCRIPTS I'VE EVER SEEN 
THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE CYNICALLY THINK 
THAT ACTORS DO ADVERTS FOR THE MONEY 
AND DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY 
BUT YOU TOOK THAT AS A BIT OF ACTING YES BECAUSE IT WAS A GOOD SCRIPT 
AND ALSO THE LEEDS MAN THESE WERE VERY GOOD SKETCHES OF THIS CHARACTER 
AND I MEAN I THINK IT WAS EARLY RAP ACTUALLY 
AND AGAIN YOU DID TWO ONE MINUTE ONES AND A THIRTY SECOND ONE 
ONCE A YEAR IT'S A WEEK'S WORK 
AND PROBABLY A YEAR'S MONEY ASTONISHING AMOUNTS THEY PAY 
YES AND YOU OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT DOING THINGS 
THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO 
A TELEVISION SERIES ONE HAVE FOND MEMORIES OF 
BUT PROBABLY FEW PEOPLE REMEMBER IS DON'T FORGET TO WRITE 
BY CHARLES WOOD WONDERFUL 
WHICH WAS A TREMENDOUS SERIES 
AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW WHO ARE WRITERS 
REMEMBER THAT SERIES VERY FONDLY 
THAT WAS VERY VERY DIFFERENT FROM 
I'D SAY IT'S THE OTHER END THE POSH ACADEMIC END OF YOUR ACTING 
BUT YOU WERE PLAYING A RELUCTANT PLAYWRIGHT 
YES I MEAN HE 
GOT FED UP WRITING AND HE WOULD LOCK HIMSELF IN HIS ROOM 
MAKE A TAPE RECORDING OF HIS TYPING 
AND THEN SWITCH ON THE TAPE RECORDER 
AND OPEN THE WINDOW AND GO OUT AND DO SOME GARDENING 
GORDON DO YOU WANT ANOTHER CUP OF TEA 
AND WHEN GWEN WATFORD THE WIFE CAME AND LISTENED AT THE DOOR 
ALL SHE HEARD WAS TIP TAP SO SHE ASSUMED HE WAS WORKING 
UNTIL SHE FOUND OUT 
MORE TEA 
TURN THE TYPEWRITER OFF WOULD YOU PLEASE 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY TWO YEARS YOU HAVE EVER TRIED TO DECEIVE ME 
NONSENSE YES OH I'VE TRIED OFTEN 
WHY SOME OF THEM WERE QUITE PRETTY 
THE STUFF THAT'S COME IN IN RECENT YEARS THAT YOU WERE OFFERED 
HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT TO DO IS IT THE SCRIPT 
YES IF BY PAGE FIVE YOU GET UP TO MAKE A CUP OF COFFEE 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT 
IF YOU DON'T GET UP TO MAKE A CUP OF COFFEE 
IT'S MORE THAN LIKELY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IT 
BUT YOU CAN TELL AT ONCE 
I MEAN WITH GOOD WRITING NO PROBLEM AT ALL 
BUT OCCASIONALLY YOU GET SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE 
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT 
BUT YOU'RE THINKING WHAT CAN I DO WITH THIS ROLE 
NO BEFORE THAT YOU'RE THINKING DOES THIS COME OFF THE PAGE 
AND MOST TIMES IT DOES 
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM 
I MEAN CHARLES WOOD CAME OFF THE PAGE LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS 
AND THERE WAS NO PROBLEM AT ALL THERE 
AND WHAT WAS SO WONDERFUL WAS 
CHARLES LIKED WRITING TWO PEOPLE TALKING 
AND IT WAS GOOD STUFF 
BUT SOME PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET THAT TO DIRECT 
THEY GIVE YOU AN AWFUL LOT OF MUSIC OVER IT 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK IT WORKS 
BUT IT DID WORK WITH CHARLES EVER SINGLE SCRIPT 
IT'S A RATHER NEGLECTED SERIES 
BUT I THINK YOU WERE A VICTIM OF B. B. C. POLITICS PERHAPS 
I THINK WE WERE YES BECAUSE WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE 
CHANGED THE TIME OF TRANSMISSION EVERY WEEK 
WHICH DIDN'T GIVE IT MUCH OF A CHANCE 
WHICH WAS SAD PARTICULARLY AS PEOPLE KEPT SAYING 
WHAT A LOVELY SERIES IT WAS 
A LOT OF THE STUFF YOU'VE DONE RECENTLY IS TONY GROUNDS 
IT IS HIS SUBJECT BUT HAS BEEN ABOUT CLASS 
A LOT OF THE DINNER PARTY IS ABOUT THAT A CLASS APART IS ABOUT THAT 
HAVING THE RANGE IN YOUR BACKGROUND HAVING CHANGED YOUR VOICE AND SO ON 
THAT'S PRESUMABLY QUITE AN INTERESTING AREA FOR YOU 
YES BECAUSE IN A CLASS APART I WAS A GRANDAD COCKNEY GRANDAD 
AND IN THE DINNER PARTY I WAS A BIT POSH 
AND PROBABLY THE ONLY REDEEMING FEATURE ABOUT THE PLAY 
WAS MY CHARACTER BECAUSE THEY WERE REALLY 
THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WERE ALL RIGHT BUT THE OTHERS WERE MONSTERS 
SOME PEOPLE IN THEIR LATER YEARS GET DEPRESSED THEY GET ANGRY 
THEY JUST SIMPLY DON'T LIKE GETTING OLDER HAVE YOU FELT ANY OF THAT 
NO I MEAN I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT I'M NOT AS NIPPY ON MY FEET 
AS I USED TO BE 
AND I'D NEVER RUN ANYWHERE ANYWAY SO THAT DOESN'T WORRY ME 
NO YOU GET A BIT SLOWER 
A BIT STIFF WHEN YOU GET UP FROM THE CHAIRS I WILL AFTER TALKING TO YOU 
YOU'LL HELP ME OUT THOUGH WON'T YOU I WILL 
NO IT DOESN'T WORRY ME 
AND I SUGGESTED EARLIER ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT ACTING 
IS THAT YOU CAN SIMPLY KEEP GOING 
YES YEAH 
I MEAN I'M STILL GOING 
THE LAST THING I DID IN THE THEATRE BEFORE PARTY PIECE 
WAS HERITAGE AT HAMPSTEAD IN WHICH I PLAYED A CHELSEA PENSIONER 
AND THAT WAS A LOVELY PLAY 
AND WE WENT DOWN TO HAVE LUNCH AT THE ROYAL HOSPITAL 
AND THEY'RE TERRIBLY FUNNY BECAUSE THEY SAY 
THE ONLY ONES WHO LEAVE HERE LEAVE TO GET MARRIED 
WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARY 
AND THEY'RE SO FULL OF VITALITY ENERGY AND LOVELY PEOPLE TO BE WITH 
THE O. B. E. YOU GOT DID THAT MEAN A GREAT DEAL TO YOU 
NOT A GREAT DEAL IT WAS VERY NICE 
YEAH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
I THINK ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
PROBABLY I DIDN'T APPROVE OF IT BEFORE I GOT IT 
I WONDERED ABOUT THAT I DO NOW 
AND WHO GAVE IT TO YOU HER MAJESTY 
AND DID SHE SAY NICE LITTLE EARNER TO YOU WHEN SHE NO 
SHE SAID ARE YOU STILL DOING THE TELEVISION WORK 
AND I SAID YES MA'AM I AM 
SHE SAID I DON'T SEE VERY MUCH I'M VERY BUSY NOW 
YOU SAY YOU WOULDN'T HAVE APPROVED OF IT BEFORE 
SO A BIT OF A LEFTY WERE YOU 
NO I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT FOR ACTORS TO GET THESE AWARDS 
THE PEOPLE IN BUSINESS AND INVENTING AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT 
ARE THE ONES WHO REALLY DESERVE THEM 
BUT I MEAN WE GET WELL PAID FOR DOING SOMETHING WE LIKE DOING 
BUT THAT WAS NICE TO HAVE AND IT WAS NICE TO GO TO THE PALACE 
AND TAKE THE FAMILY WITH ME AND HAVE THE CAR SEARCHED AS WE WENT IN 
AND BE SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSED BECAUSE THERE WAS TWO POTS OF CURRY 
THAT MY WIFE HAD BROUGHT UP IN THE CAR FOR OUR DAUGHTER 
AND THE POLICE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS 
DO YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS ABOUT YOUR ACTING CAREER 
NO NONE AT ALL 
PRETTY HAPPY POSITION TO BE IN YES VERY 
GEORGE COLE THANK YOU THANK YOU
