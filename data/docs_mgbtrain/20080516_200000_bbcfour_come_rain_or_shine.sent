O. K. 
SO THIS IS ER 
ASK NOT 
WHAT YOU COUNTRY CAN DO FOR YOU 
ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR COUNTRY 
GENESIS GENESIS 
GENESIS GENESIS 
GENESIS GENESIS 
GENESIS 
GENESIS GENESIS 
GENESIS 
GENESIS GENESIS 
GENESIS GENESIS 
GENESIS 
I'M KINDA FEELING I SHOULD'VE HAD A PEE 
THERE'S TIME DOWN THERE I WOULDN'T MIND ONE 
O. K. YEP 
PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA 
ALL TEN DROPS 
O. K. 
NOW I GUESS YOU'RE ALL WONDERING WHY WE GOT YOU HERE 
WHAT IT IS IN FACT WE'RE DOING 
WELL 
NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE KNOW HOW HARD WE WORK 
THEY ALL THINK IT'S SEX DRUGS AND ROCK'N'ROLL 
IT'S IT IS JUST THAT ACTUALLY 
NOT FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR SOMETHING 
RIGHT YEAH 
GOOD DAY 
HI 
WHO'S THIS 
HOW ARE YA GOOD 
ANY EXCUSE 
HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING LONG 
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU 
FIFTEEN YEARS DARLING DARLING 
GOOD TO SEE YOU GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO 
ARE WE ACTUALLY DOING ANYTHING OR ARE WE JUST SORT OF SAYING HELLO 
JUST WE'RE DOING NOTHING 
SO THERE'S ALWAYS THE PROBLEM 
THE LONG SONGS ARE LONG ARE LONG 
THEY TAKE UP 
THEY TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE 
DOMINO I THINK OF AS A TWO PART THING LIKE HOMES BY THE SEA 
BUT IT ISN'T IS IT 
OR IS IT DOMINO IT IS A BIT 
THERE'S A SONG PART AND THEN THERE'S THE 
DUDDLE UN DUDDLE UN DUDDLE UN DUDDLE UN DUDDLE UN DUN 
I MEAN ACTUALLY DUDDLE UN DUDDLE UN DUN 
WE WROTE ALL THOSE LAST THREE OR FOUR ALBUMS TOGETHER 
THAT'S SOMETHING I FELT WE HAD SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT OF THAT 
BUT NONE OF US REALLY DID IT INDIVIDUALLY 
WE BROUGHT THINGS OUT OF EACH OTHER 
I REALLY DID I HAD A GREAT TIME 
AND THE THING THAT I REALLY ENJOYED ALMOST MORE THAN THE MUSIC 
IS THE LAUGHING 
WE HAVE A GREAT TIME TOGETHER AND WE PLAY SOME MUSIC 
IN TERMS OF PLAYING LIVE MUSIC 
UM 
YOU KNOW THIS IS THE MOST IT'S PROBABLY ALL I'VE GOT REALLY 
AND I'M PROUD OF ALL THE MUSIC WE'VE DONE 
THE WHOLE THING REALLY 
IS BASED ROUND THE FACT THAT THE TWO OF US AND WITH PHIL 
PUT US IN A ROOM AND SOMETHING QUITE SPECIAL HAPPENS 
WHAT TIME IS IT ARE WE DONE TODAY 
WE'VE ONLY JUST STARTED 
WE COME WE MADE UP A TUNE THEN WE HAD LUNCH 
IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE REHEARSALS TODAY I FEEL WE'RE GOING TOO FAST 
THE CINEMA SHOW THERE YOU GO WHAT'S THAT TUNE 
IT'S A DECENT HARMONY 
I'M QUITE ENJOYING IT SO FAR 
I WILL MAKE MY BED 
SHE SAID 
BUT TURNED TO GO HOME 
CAN SHE BE LATE FOR HER CINEMA SHOW 
O. K. NOT SO GOOD IDEA 
I WILL MAKE MY BED 
WITH HER TONIGHT 
HE CRIES 
CAN HE FAIL 
ARMED WITH HIS CHOCOLATE SURPRISE 
LISTEN TO THE OLD ONE SPEAK 
OF ALL HE HAS LIVED THROUGH 
I HAVE CROSSED BETWEEN THE POLES 
FOR ME THERE'S NO MYSTERY 
ONCE A MAN LIKE THE SEA I RAGED 
ONCE A WOMAN 
LIKE THE EARTH I GAVE 
AND THERE IS IN FACT MORE EARTH THAN SEA 
I CAME BACK 
I CAME BACK FROM REHEARSAL THE OTHER DAY 
AND I JUST THOUGHT YOU KNOW 
THIS BAND COULD BE AN INCREDIBLE BAND 
IF WE WERE JUST THAT LITTLE BIT MORE TALENTED 
I ACTUALLY SAID IT TO MYSELF 
YOU KNOW LIKE YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE LIKE U. TWO HAVE 
THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHEREAS I THINK 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS THE CASE 
MAYBE THEY'RE JUST AS FRAGILE AS WE ARE 
SOMETIMES WE'RE ON A KNIFE EDGE 
AND YOU'RE NEVER SURE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN 
WE HAD A COUPLE OF FUNNY DAYS WHERE I THOUGHT 
MAN WE COULD BE GOOD IF WE JUST HAD THAT LITTLE BIT MORE TALENT 
LISTEN 
GETTING READY TO KICK SOME ASS 
GETTING READY TO TRY TO KICK SOME ASS 
IT IS SO EXCITING 
YOU THREE GUYS YOU HAD A LONG YEAH YEAH 
TERRIFIC THING TOGETHER YOU KNOW 
SO 
FIFTEEN YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE YOU'VE PERFORMED IN THE STATES AS GENESIS 
WHAT HAS MADE THIS THE RIGHT TIME 
HAVE YOU ASKED UM ER YOUR EX PARTNER PETER GABRIEL 
TO COME TO THE COMEBACK 
HE HE COULD BE O. K. OR NOT 
WHAT PETER 
HOW HARD HAVE YOU TRIED TO CONVINCE STEVE HACKETT 
OR PETER GABRIEL TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HISTORIC REUNION 
WELL THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN PART OF THIS YOU KNOW 
EVEN IF WE DID SOMETHING WITH PETE 
IT WOULD ONLY BE THE LAMB OR LEADING UP TO IT 
MOST OF THE MATERIAL YOU HEARD TODAY WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THAT 
SO THIS IS SOMETHING 
IT'S A DIFFERENT PROJECT YEAH DIFFERENT LIFE YEAH 
IN THE CAGE 
ROCK FACE MOVES TO PRESS MY SKIN 
WHITE LIQUIDS TURN SOUR WITHIN 
TURN FAST TURN SOUR 
TURN SWEAT TURN SOUR 
MUST TELL MYSELF 
THAT I'M NOT HERE 
I'M DROWNING IN A LIQUID FEAR 
BOTTLED IN A STRONG COMPRESSION 
MY DISTORTION SHOWS OBSESSION 
IN THE CAVE 
GET ME OUT OF THIS CAVE 
HEY HEY 
IF I KEEP SELF CONTROL 
I'LL BE SAFE IN MY SOUL 
COS THIS CHILDHOOD BELIEF 
BRINGS A MOMENT'S RELIEF 
BUT MY CYNIC SOON RETURNS 
AND THE LIFEBOAT BURNS 
WE ORIGINALLY TALKED OF DOING THE LAMB 
FOUR SHOWS IN FIVE CITIES AROUND THE WORLD 
AND FIVE SHOWS IN FOUR CITIES AROUND THE WORLD 
SOME THING SPECIAL FILM IT D. V. D. IT WHATEVER 
BUT UM SO WHEN I SAID THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING 
IT WAS KIND OF NO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH PETE 
WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT WE CAN DO ANYTHING NOW 
SO THE STORY IS VERY SIMPLE 
YOU CAN DO MULTIPLE ARENAS WHICH MEANS SIX TO SEVEN CITIES 
AND DO THREE TO FOUR NIGHTS IN EACH OF THEM 
OR DO TWENTY SHOWS OF A BIGGER STATURE 
BUT AGAIN THAT'S BECAUSE WE CAN ISN'T IT 
IS THAT DEFINITELY THE RIGHT THING TO DO 
WHERE WOULD WE PREFER TO PLAY 
OBVIOUSLY IF YOU DO STADIUMS YOU'RE MAXIMISING 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE STADIUMED COS I SEE GENESIS PINK FLOYD 
LED ZEPPELIN THE GREAT BANDS OF ALL TIME IT'S BIG TIME 
IT SHOULD BE DONE BIG TIME AND PEOPLE THINK IT IS BIG TIME 
I THINK IT'S MORE SPECIAL TO PLAY ONE LARGER DATE 
THE SPECIALNESS IS TO SOME EXTENT CREATED BY THE FACT THAT IT'S US GUYS TOGETHER AFTER FIFTEEN 
IT'S NOT THE SIZE OF IT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SPECIAL 
I THINK THERE'S TWO ARGUMENTS 
I THINK WE CREATE MORE OF A PRESENCE 
AND IF WE'RE GONNA GO AFTER THIS ONCE LET'S MAKE IT A BIG PRESENCE 
I JUST KNOW THAT 
IT'S LIKE WE'RE MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY IF WE DON'T DO THIS 
AND JUST BY NATURE FROM THE SPEAKING PERSON I'M JUST A GUY WHO WANTS TO PLAY A BIT OF MUSIC TO PEOPLE 
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THAT 
BUT EVERYBODY PLAYS ARENAS 
POP GROUPS DO THREE FOUR FIVE SETS LIVE 
I DO FOUR NIGHTS AT WEMBLEY ARENA 
SO GENESIS DO THREE NIGHTS AT WEMBLEY ARENA HOW EXCITING IS THAT 
D'YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
NO I JUST THINK THE IDEA OF IT BEING SOMETHING SPECIAL 
SOMEWHERE IN GERMANY SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND 
AND SOMEWHERE CENTRAL TO A FEW OTHER COUNTRIES 
WE COULD DO FOUR NIGHTS YEAH 
AND DRAW 
IT HAS SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO ME WHAT YOU JUST SAID 
DEFEATS THE ARGUMENT OF PLAYING MULTIPLE NIGHTS IN ARENAS 
BECAUSE YOU PLAY LESS CITIES AND PEOPLE HAVE TO TRAVEL MORE 
DON'T FUCK WITH ME JOHN 
YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING 
I WAS TRYING TO BE AMUSING I KNOW 
THE EXCLUSIVITY IS PART OF THE APPEAL 
ONLY TWENTY SHOWS AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO GO TO FORTY 
THEN YOU END UP PLAYING DOWN THE ROAD FROM YOURSELF 
YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY WELL YOU DO TWENTY SHOWS 
WITHOUT THE SINGER IF YOU DO FORTY SHOWS 
THAT'S ONE THING TO BEAR IN MIND 
YES SO WOULD YOU LIKE THE ONE WITH PHIL OR THE ONE WITHOUT STRAIGHT TO THE POINT 
I'M NOT GONNA HOLD BACK ON THIS 
I DON'T WANNA DO MORE THAN TWENTY SHOWS O. K. 
BUT I MEAN SURELY WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE MAIN PRINCIPLE OF THE TWENTY 
YEAH THE PRINCIPLE OF DOING TWENTY SHOWS THAN WORKING OUT WHERE THE TWENTY SHOWS SHOULD BE 
IS THERE A CHOICE I'D LIKE TO THINK THERE WAS A CHOICE BUT 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ALL RIGHT WELL 
I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE'S GOTTA HOLD THE RANGE 
OTHERWISE IT WILL BE A RUN AWAY HORSE YOU KNOW 
SO AND REALLY MY LIFE IS SO COMPLICATED THAT 
I'M THINKING OF OTHER THINGS 
NOT JUST ME GOING OUT THERE AND SINGING 
I'M JUST THINKING OF A BALANCE 
OF KEEPING EVERYTHING THAT I WANNA DO 
OR SHOULD DO AT THIS POINT OF MY LIFE YOU KNOW 
ERM THERE AND NOBODY ELSE HAS THAT AGENDA 
UNDERSTANDS THAT AGENDA BUT ME REALLY EVERYBODY SAYS 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND IT MUST BE DIFFICULT OR IT MUST BE CRAZY YOU KNOW 
BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT ENDS UP NOT SEEING MY OWN KIDS 
SO I'M VERY BLOODY MINDED ABOUT NOT GOING BACK 
AND DOING YOU KNOW WASTING TIME IF YOU LIKE 
CAN YOU SQUEEZE TOGETHER 
SQUEEZE ME 
AGAIN PLEASE 
COME ONE THAT'S O. K. GREAT 
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THANKS YEP THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO 
YOU'VE GOT TWO BOOKS 
IF YOU START ON PAGE ONE YOU SEE THE CONVERSATION I HAD WITH PATRICK 
WHICH IS IN BLUE 
WE TALKED ABOUT VARIOUS WAYS OF DOING INTERESTING THINGS 
AT THE END OF A STADIUM 
ONE IDEA WHICH IS ILLUSTRATED IN THE FIRST FEW PAGES 
IS OF HAVING A LOT OF TOWERS WHICH CAN HAVE LIGHTS THAT PAN UP AND DOWN THEM 
AND THEN I FINALLY GOT TO PAGE FIVE WHERE I FIRMED THIS UP INTO 
A SORT OF NUMBER ONE POSSIBLE FIRM IDEA 
THE FACT THAT AS A BAND YOU TAKE UP VERY LITTLE SPACE 
ONE THING WHICH WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO DO 
WOULD BE TO PUT YOU IN A CAPSULE AND CHANGE THE POSITION OF THAT CAPSULE 
RELATIVE TO THE BACKDROP 
ALMOST AS A CARAVAN AS A VEHICLE AS A POD 
AND IT'S BASICALLY ON A GIANT FORKLIFT TRUCK THAT WE BUILD 
AS PART OF THE BACKDROP 
WHICH STARTED OFF AT THE FRONT OF THE STAGE LIKE THIS 
GOT PICKED UP AND DID THIS AND FLEW BACK AND 
AND IT'S SHOWN HERE UP IN THE AIR IN THIS SKETCH THIS IS THIS THING 
MM H. M. M. THAT COULD GO AND DOWN 
AND YOU FILL THE SPACE UNDERNEATH WITH VIDEO PICTURE 
HRRM I DO SUFFER QUITE BADLY FROM VERTIGO 
YEAH 
I JUST THOUGHT I'D MENTION THAT BEFORE 
YOU COULD GET OFF JUST BEFORE 
WE'LL GIVE YOU A GREEN LIGHT I DON'T MIND SENDING THE SINGER UP 
BUT I DON'T HONESTLY 
I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M UNCERTAIN TO THE HEIGHT THAT IS THERE 
WHICH IS ALSO THE HEIGHT OF THE P. A. TOWERS AND STUFF 
ERM I DON'T KNOW WE COULD 
WELL WE NEED TO COME BACK TO THAT ONE 
GENESIS ARE AT THEIR BEST IN CONCERT 
NEARLY EVERYWHERE THEY PLAY THEY TAKE THE AUDIENCE BY STORM 
AND LAST YEAR THEY WERE VOTED NUMBER ONE LIVE BAND IN THE WORLD 
IF YOU GO BACK TO THE EARLY DAYS OF GENESIS 
THEY WERE ALWAYS THEATRICAL 
THEY WERE ALWAYS THREE DIMENSIONAL 
IF YOU GO BACK TO WHEN PETER WAS THERE WATCHER OF THE SKIES 
WITH THE MAKE UP AND THE BAT WINGS 
IT WAS A VERY THREE DIMENSIONAL LOOK YOU'D GET THIS 
YOU'D GET THIS DEPTH IN THE STAGE 
WE'VE ALWAYS YOU KNOW HAD A BIG VISUAL SHOW 
IN THE EARLY DAYS WE DIDN'T HAVE HELPERS WE JUST DID IT OURSELVES 
BACK IN THE DAYS OF THE LAMB LIES DOWN ON BROADWAY 
AND THE IDEAS SORT OF CAME FROM WITHIN THE GROUP 
AND WE EXPANDED ON THEM WE EVEN GOT PEOPLE TO HELP US 
BUT IT VERY MUCH STARTED WITH US 
AND OVER THE YEARS YOU START TO FIND PEOPLE WHO YOU CAN 
GET YOUR IDEAS THROUGH AND WHO'VE GOT PRACTICALLY MINDED PEOPLE 
WHO CAN GET IT TO THE NEXT STAGE 
BUT I THINK GENERALLY WE'VE ALWAYS 
ALL OF US HAVE HAD A THEATRICAL KIND OF TASTE 
IS THAT NEW YEAH 
I MEAN REALLY NEW YEAH 
I GOT AN ELECTRIC GUITAR CUT IT IN HALF 
YOU CUT IT YOU CUT IT IN HALF 
IT'S LIKE THE TOP ONE'S A BIT FAR THAT WAY 
YOU WANNA KIND OF GO 
DON'T YOU 
SO MY NAME'S MIKE MY GUITAR'S A BIT OFF CENTRE 
WE'LL JUST ATTACK IT LA D. A. D. A. 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX 
THERE'S ANOTHER COUPLE OF BARS THERE I'M STILL GOING 
I'M STILL CREATING 
YOU NEED ME DON'T YOU 
D'YOU NEED MORE OF ME 
PA D. A. PA D. A. PA PA PA 
ONE TWO THEE FOUR FIVE SIX 
SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE 
OH YEAH NICE 
GOOD IS IT FOR REAL HUH NOW YOU'VE GOTTA DO IT FOR REAL 
SCARY ACTUALLY 
I'M SCARED 
IT'S BASED ON A RHYTHM THING YOU KNOW SO I'VE GOTTA FIND OUT WHAT THAT RHYTHM FELT LIKE 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM IT'S MY PROBLEM 
EVERY INSTRUMENT NEEDS 
YOU NEED TO REHEARSE YOU NEED TO PRACTISE ON YOUR OWN 
AND YOU KNOW THOSE GUYS AREN'T THE TYPE TO DO THAT 
YOU KNOW AND I AM 
AND MAYBE CHESTER IS SO 
IT WASN'T AS HARD FOR US 
IT'S FINE IT'S ABOUT NOW SOMEBODY SAID THIS TO ME THE OTHER DAY 
ALL RIGHT AND HERE IS THE STADIUM SHOW A RENDITION 
ALL THESE BITS YOU KNOW THEY COME DOWN 
YOU REMEMBER THAT I THINK SO IT'S WHAT WE SAW BEFORE 
IT'S JUST SO TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT PHIL I'VE GOT A DRAWING HERE 
JUST SO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF LIGHT 
THERE YOU ARE 
THE STAGE WE'RE ON IS QUITE SMALL WE MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS 
DO YOU THINK THAT THE STAGE THAT THE BAND'S ON A BIT SMALL 
YOU'RE KIDDING ME NO 
I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS 
WE'VE GOT A HUGE STAGE AND IT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH 
NO THE AREA WE'RE IN IS RAISED UP 
ISN'T IT THE BIT WE'RE ON HOW CAN IT BE SMALL WE'VE GOT SIXTY EIGHT FUCKING METRES WIDE 
BUT THE BIT WE'RE ON THE RAISED UP BIT WE'RE ON IS VERY TIGHT 
OH DEAR RIGHT 
NO IT WAS NICE 
THE DIDDLE A DIDDLE A BIT ON A. 
WE HAVEN'T QUITE WORKED THAT ONE OUT YET 
IF WE CAN'T DO THE DE D. A. DEE D. A. DE D. A. DEE D. A. 
BLAT UM BLAT UM BLAT UM DUM D. A. DEE D. A. D. A. DEE D. A. 
D. A. D. A. DE DAT D. A. D. A. D. A. 
YOU'RE COMING TO THE WRONG BIT 
D. A. CHUK 
D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. DAH D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. 
SO YOU CAN'T DO THE D. A. DEE D. A. I CAN I JUST THINK THE THING IS ALREADY BORDERLINE LENGTH ANYHOW 
DOO 
EVEN IF IT'S A BLANK ONE YEAH I LIKE THAT 
YEAH YOU KNOW THAT PUSH THAT BLAT UM BLAT UM BLAT UM 
UNLESS YOU GO TO THE BLAG UM BLAG UM BLAG UM BLAG UM BLAG UM UH 
YEAH I MEAN CONSIDERING WE'RE PLAYING IN CAVES AND GIANT PLACES 
YOU ALMOST NEED A BIGGER GAP TO MAKE IT WORK YOU KNOW TO MAKE IT 
ANYWAY 
TONY AND MIKE TOGETHER ARE MORE OF THE SPIRIT OF GENESIS THAN ME 
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW 
THEY THINK THE SINGER'S THE GUY THAT DOES IT ALL 
AND THAT'S THE LINK AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE PROBLEM 
THEY THOUGHT PETER GABRIEL DID IT ALL 
IT WASN'T THAT WAY 
FROM A STAGE POINT OF VIEW WITHOUT PEOPLE LIKE THAT WHO CAN COMMUNICATE WITH A CROWD 
YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE 
BUT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE MUSIC THE WRITING 
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY MAJOR ROLES IN THIS GROUP TO WRITE MUSIC 
COS BACK IN THE TIME WHEN PETE FIRST LEFT 
MIKE AND I DEFINITELY DID THE LION'S SHARE OF THE WRITING EVEN BEFORE THAT 
BUT IN THE LATER PART PHIL'S CONTRIBUTION CAME TO MORE OF A LEVEL WITH OURS 
THAT WAS THE THING I'D SAY A VERY MUCH EVEN THING ON THOSE LAST TWO GENESIS ALBUMS 
HEY MIKE HOW ARE YOU GOOD MORNING 
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FOR TEN MILLION IS IT YEAH 
GET MY BEARINGS FIRST OF ALL 
YEAH THAT'S THE THING ISN'T IT 
IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER WHAT NIGHTS USED TO BE LIKE ISN'T IT YEAH 
ALL THIS STUFF THE GUY WITH A POLE BANGING A PAR LAMP TO TRY AND GET IT YES YEAH 
THE GEL BURNING THROUGH YOU KNOW 
THESE ARE REALLY GOOD THESE HAVE SOME NICE EFFECTS ON THEM TOO UNUSUAL EFFECTS 
DO THE TRIP OUT DAVE WE FOUND A REALLY GOOD THING ON THE 
BROW OH I SEE OH RIGHT THE RED SNAKE 
THE RED SNAKE 
YOU ALL RIGHT 
OH THERE YOU GO WHOA 
IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE DESIGN BY COMMITTEE WHICH TO A DEGREE THIS IS 
THEN YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE A COMMITTEE THAT THINKS ALIKE 
OTHERWISE IT DEFINITELY ISN'T GONNA WORK 
I THINK CERTAINLY WITH TONY AND MIKE THEY HAVE CLEAR IDEAS OF WHAT THEY DON'T WANT 
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY COME WITH VIEW OF EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT THEY JUST KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T WANT 
LET'S TURN THE LIGHTS OFF A MINUTE 
LET'S JUST SEE WHAT THE SCREENS ARE LIKE 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE BEHIND THE BARS 
YEAH 
WHAT ARE WE DOING THEN FROM THE BEGINNING 
OH RIGHT O. K. 
NO I WANNA GO TO THE NEXT HALF NOW FROM THE BEGINNING ALL RIGHT 
YOU WANT THE SECOND HALF YEAH O. K. AND YOU DON'T CARE WE'LL DO THE SECOND HALF ALL RIGHT 
FOUR MORE TIMES AND RUN THROUGH IT IF YOU WANNA RUN THROUGH IT 
BEFORE WE RUN THROUGH IT ANOTHER THIRTY TIMES GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF 
I KNOW WE NEED TO DO IT BUT IT'S JUST IT'S BORING DOING IT HERE 
THAT'S LIFE THAT'S CALLED REHEARSAL 
THREE FOUR 
IN SILENCE AND DARKNESS 
I DIDN'T LISTEN TO THE SONGS' 
APART FROM WHAT I'D LISTENED TO IN THE CAR WITH MY KIDS 
SO I HADN'T HEARD DOMINO FOR EXAMPLE UNTIL WE ACTUALLY HAD TO PLAY IT 
AND IT WAS LIKE GOD IT WAS AMAZING HOW QUICKLY IT CAME BACK 
AND IT WAS ALSO AMAZING 
HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS STILL TO SING SOME OBSCURE GENESIS LYRICS 
YOU KNOW BEING A KIND OF DIRECT EMOTIONAL WRITER SINGER 
YOU KNOW I SAY I LOVE YOU AND I MISS YOU AND I WANT YOU 
WHATEVER IT IS 
AND NOW I'VE GOT TO SING SHEETS OF DOUBLE GLAZING AND NYLON SHEETS AND BLANKETS 
AND IT'S I DUNNO HOW TO DO THAT I NEVER DID KNOW HOW TO DO THAT 
AND UM I REALISED THAT I WAS A CARICATURE IN SOME RESPECTS 
VERY OVER THE TOP I HATE IT ACTUALLY I CAN'T REALLY WATCH IT 
BUT I'VE JUST DECIDED TO STAND THERE AND SING IT YOU KNOW 
I CAN'T CAN'T DO IT ANY OTHER WAY 
AND IF ANYBODY EXPECTS ME TO 
IT WON'T HAPPEN YOU KNOW 
BUT THAT'S THE PLACING AS WELL 
I THINK IT'S A PLACING AND I THINK IT'S WHERE IT IS 
YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO MAKE DECISIONS ARE YOU I'M SURE IF IT WAS A KEYBOARD PLAYER 
I COULD FIND SOMEONE COULD I SUGGEST SOME LATER SUGGESTIONS 
WE COULD PUT RIPPLES AFTER MAMA YEAH 
IT'S CONNOISSEUR STUFF THIS THEY'LL LOVE IT BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HELP THEM BACK A BIT YOU BUY THEIR GOODWILL 
YOU SLIP ONE IN WITHOUT THEM KNOWING YOU'VE BOUGHT YOUR GOODWILL 
THAT'S QUITE NICE YEAH 
MARCHING TO THE PROMISED LAND 
WHERE THE HONEY FLOWS AND TAKES YOU BY THE HAND 
PULLS YOU DOWN ON YOUR KNEES WHILE YOU'RE DOWN 
I SUPPOSE IN THE PAST EVERY TOUR WAS PART OF AN ONGOING TOUR AND ALBUM IT WAS QUITE 
AN EVERYDAY PART OF YOUR LIFE AND WE HAVEN'T DONE IT FOR A LONG TIME 
I ALSO THINK THAT DOING THE BOOK HAD AN EFFECT ON US 
WHILE WE REHEARSED SEEING THAT PASSAGE OF TIME 
OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS AND READING ABOUT YOURSELVES 
WHICH WE CAN'T FORGET 
IT HAD AN EFFECT ON ME IT MADE YOU APPRECIATE WHAT WE HAVE TOGETHER 
SAIL AWAY 
ALTHOUGH WE KNOW IT WE'RE ENGLISH SO WE NEVER SAY IT OUT LOUD 
AND MADE US THINK WHAT A GREAT TIME IT'S BEEN 
YOU REALISE WHAT WE MEANT TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT EACH OTHER SAYING IT 
WHICH IS KIND OF INTERESTING 
AND IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WHEN YOU GET TO THIS KIND OF PERIOD IN YOUR LIFE YOU KNOW 
PUTTING THINGS AWAY AND DESPATCHING THEM IT'S NICE TO HAVE DONE IT 
HOW MUCH OF YOUR LIFE DO YOU ACTUALLY SPEND ON THE ROAD UH 
I'M TOLD IT'S SEVEN MONTHS OF THE YEAR 
BUT IT NEVER ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE THAT 
COS IT'S SPLIT UP QUITE A LOT 
I'VE BEEN PLAYING IN PROFESSIONAL BANDS SINCE I WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN 
SO I'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD A WHILE ONE OF THE REASONS I WAS SO KEEN TO DO THIS 
IS I FELT THAT IT WOULD BE FOR PHIL IT WOULD BE LIKE COMING HOME 
WITH THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF BEING PHIL COLLINS 
AND ALL THAT GOES WITH THAT AND HAVING TO RUN THE WHOLE SHOW 
ON HIS SOLO STUFF AND HAVING ALL THIS OTHER STUFF GOING ON IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE AT THE SAME TIME 
I THINK IT WAS JUST A BURDEN 
IT'S PART OF WHAT COMES WHEN YOU BECOME VERY FAMOUS LIKE HE HAS 
SOMETIMES IT SEEMS TO DRAG THIS OTHER STUFF WITH IT AND IT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY WHEN HE DECIDED TO BE THE SINGER 
IT WAS SORT OF THE MOMENT WHEN EVERYTHING WAS SET IN MOTION 
AND SOME OF THE THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN THAT WILL MAKE PERSONAL LIFE MORE DIFFICULT 
COS THAT'S WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN SINGERS ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAGE EVERYONE SEES THEM 
THEY'RE NOT LEFT ALONE THAT'S QUITE TOUGH I WOULDN'T WANNA DO IT 
I CAN'T DO EVERYBODY THOUGH IT'S NOT FAIR YOU KNOW 
I'M SORRY 
NIKOLAI NIKOLAI 
WE'RE JUST TESTING THEM ONE BY ONE CAN YOU DO THEM ALL AT ONCE 
O. K. 
DO NOT FIRE BEFORE I TELL YOU 
THERE'S ONE MISSING 
DO LITTLE ONES LITTLE BACK BACK BACK 
IT'S IMPRESSIVE BUT IS IT GENESIS SOMETIMES 
IT'S JUST THAT SORT OF MOMENT THAT TAKES IT OVER A LIMIT 
WITH THIS KIND OF SPECTACLE YOU'RE ALWAYS WORKING ON THE LIMITS OF WHAT'S TASTEFUL AND WHAT'S NOT 
WE NEED TO TRY AND STAY WITHIN THAT TASTEFULNESS 
THAT JUST TAKES IT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU SEE THE WHOLE THING DIFFERENTLY IT'S FUN TO WATCH 
IT DOESN'T DO MUCH FOR ME 
I WOULD DESCRIBE TONY AS THE CONSCIENCE OF THE BAND 
IT'S NOT TO DENY THAT EVERYONE ELSE HAD A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ROLE 
AND ARE STRONG WRITERS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT AS THEY'VE PROVED 
BUT FOR TONY GENESIS WAS HIS SOLO CAREER 
IT'S MUCH CLOSER TO THE KIND OF THING I DO ON MY SOLO ALBUMS 
SO IF YOU LIKE THE BRAZILIAN YOU SHOULD GO AND BUY THEM 
WHICH NO ONE DOES 
I TEND TO TRY TO TAKE THE GROUP A LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM DOING JUST THE STRAIGHT POP SONGS ALL THE TIME 
I LOVE DOING POP SONGS AND SOME OF THOSE ONES I'VE BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN 
BUT I KIND OF LIKE TO MAKE SURE WE DO A BIT MORE OF THE OTHER 
SONGS LIKE DOMINO AND HOME BY THE SEA 
THE OTHERS ENJOYED IT AS WELL IT'S NOT REALLY LIKE THAT WHEN LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES 
AS YOU CAN SEE WITH THE SOLO ALBUMS THEY TEND TO BOTH DO THINGS THAT ARE MORE CONCISE 
I'M THE OTHER WAY GIVEN HALF A CHANCE AND ON MY LAST SOLO ALBUM I HAD AN EIGHTEEN MINUTE SONG 
IT'S COS THAT'S WHAT GIVES ME PLEASURE 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT I DO BEST 
JUST DOING EVERYTHING USING THE THREE FOUR FIVE CHORD BASIC STUFF 
I DON'T MIND A BIT OF THAT BUT I DON'T WANT IT ALL THE TIME 
THE WHOLE SECTION 
IS NOT QUITE RIGHT YET 
WHEN THE MAN IS LITTLE IT BECOMES SECONDARY 
WHEN IT STARTS IT STARTS GREAT THEN IT GOES UP TO THE BIG FACE THAT COMES IN LIKE THAT GREAT 
THEN PHIL COMES IN AND THERE'S NO BIG MEN TILL THE KEYBOARD SOLO 
THE KEYBOARD SOLO COULD HAVE A RUNNING MAN 
A LITTLE MAN COMING IN THERE LITTLE MEN GOING PAST BIG TO SMALL 
YEAH LITTLE MEN GOING AWAY SO THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A FIGURE RIGHT THERE 
SORT OF STUFF GOING ON 
THE TROUBLE IS THAT A BIG MAN ALL THE TIME TAKES OVER 
A LITTLE MAN I THINK IS THE SAME JOB 
WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT 
UP TO THAT BIG FACE IS GREAT 
THEN YOU START A LOT OF STUFF I THINK KEEP A LOT OF THE BIG MEN OUT AFTER THAT TILL AFTER 
MAYBE THEY CAN COME IN AT THE KEYBOARD SIDE OF IT 
THE SOLO YEAH KEYBOARD SOLO STAY SMALL TO THE KEYBOARD SOLO 
O. K. SOUNDS GOOD 
THAT'S GREAT O. K. PERFECT LET'S DO THAT 
THERE'S AN INTERESTING REVIEW IN ENGLAND THAT SAID 
MIKE RUTHERFORD WAS OUTGUNNED BY HIS SECOND GUITARIST DARYL STUERMER 
AND THE GUY MISSED THE POINT COMPLETELY THE FACT THAT MIKE'S PLAYING LEAD GUITAR 
IS NOT BECAUSE HE THINKS HE IS THE BEST LEAD GUITAR PLAYER IN THE WORLD 
IT'S THE FACT THAT HE WROTE THE MUSIC 
I DO MOST OF THE WORK 
I WRITE THE SONGS AND I SING AND I DRUM AND I PLAY KEYBOARDS 
BUT I HAVE TO GIVE TONY AND PHIL A BIT OF CREDIT 
SO THEY DON'T FEEL LEFT OUT 
MIKE IS A REALLY CREATIVE WRITER AND COMES UP WITH SOME VERY OFF THE WALL STUFF 
AND ALSO GIVES THE BALLS TO THE BAND 
HIS BASS PLAYING AND GUITAR PLAYING 
HE'S MORE ROCK AND ROLL HE'S MORE OF A ROCK 
I SUPPOSE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT TONY WAS A BEATLES FAN MIKE WAS A ROLLING STONES FAN 
ROUND ROUND ROUND ROUND ROUND 
SOMEBODY SOMEBODY GET ME OUT OF THIS CAGE 
GET ME OUT OF THIS CAGE 
GET ME OUT OF THIS CAGE 
ERRORS PROBLEMS FOR EVERYONE IT'S JUST 
RIGHT 
ARE WE GOING TO DO ANOTHER REHEARSAL TONIGHT 
RIGHT I DON'T KNOW WHY SO MANY THINGS DON'T HAPPEN WHEN THEY SHOULD 
I DON'T SEE MUCH BUT WHEN I DO SEE IT IT'S WRONG 
THAT'S A SHAME REALLY 
IS IT BEING RUN WHERE'S IT BEING RUN FROM 
ASK TOM 
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO RUN THE VIDEO FROM 
IT WILL BE BEHIND THE STAGE 
THE WAY IT WORKS 
MAYBE TEN CUES 
I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING THE LIGHTING OPERATOR CAN DO AT THE SAME TIME 
WE AGREE IT'S NOT 
IT'S A CASE BY CASE BASIS 
IF THE VIDEO OPERATOR IF THEY'VE GOT A CUE LIST 
A WRITTEN DOWN SCORE FOR INSTANCE 
WE ARE GOING TO JAM THIS MUCH 
THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THAT 
HE NEEDS TO BE ON HIS TOES AS SOMETIMES THE SONGS ARE DIFFERENT 
THERE WILL BE A GUY DEDICATED TO ONLY THINKING ABOUT PRESSING THE BUTTON AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME 
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER RESPONSIBILITY 
WHO IS THIS ARE YOU THE GUY 
IT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN WHEN 
THE VISUAL SIDE HAS ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT TO US 
IT'S SOMETHING I REALLY ENJOYED 
AND NOT BEING A VERY VISUAL PERFORMER 
I'M AWARE THAT WE NEED VISUAL HELP 
IN THE EARLY DAYS OBVIOUSLY WE DEVELOPED THE VARY LIGHT 
AND NOW THAT LOOK IS TOTALLY UBIQUITOUS 
EVERYBODY USES THAT HUNDREDS OF TIMES WHEN WE FIRST USED IT THE EFFECT THAT HAD 
THE FIRST TOUR SUDDENLY YOU HAD ALL THESE LIGHTS UP THERE 
AND THEY WENT FROM RED TO BLUE JUST LIKE THAT NO ONE HAD SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT 
WE JUST USED SIMPLE THINGS 
WE USED TO HAVE HALF THE LIGHTS IN RED AND HALF IN GREEN 
THEN ALTERNATED THEM 
WITH THE LIGHTS IN STRANGE POSITIONS 
IT WAS A STAGGERING EFFECT NO ONE HAD SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO BE AS REVOLUTIONARY AS THAT 
BUT YOU HOPE TO USE THINGS IN A WAY THAT IS NEW 
JUST A LITTLE TIME 
I'M IN BETWEEN I'M CONCERNED BUT I THINK IT CAN BE DEALT WITH 
THE DAYS GO BY AND IT'S STILL SO A LONG WAY AWAY 
I THINK WE GO THE SCREEN THINGS TONIGHT 
AND GET THE CUEING SYSTEM RIGHT 
THEN WE'LL GET IT RIGHT I'M STILL WORRIED ABOUT THE GUYS 
HE NEEDS TO PRACTICE SO MUCH 
COS THE GUY'S BEEN BROUGHT IN YOU KNOW 
RICHARD HAS ALL THE CUES AT NIGHT 
WHEN I GO BACK REHEARSING ALL THE SONGS 
THEN COMING BACK IN THE MORNING TO REHEARSE THE SONGS 
WE NEED TO GET YOU TWO MORE TIME TOGETHER 
I'M TRYING TO THINK OF THE MOST USEFUL SLEEP PATTERN 
THERE ISN'T ONE IS THERE 
NO 
HI THIS IS TONY BANKS I'M MIKE RUTHERFORD 
AND PHIL COLLINS GENESIS 
YOU'RE LISTENING TO WCSX 
IT'S COS THEY WRITE IT OUT IT'S W. C. S. 
HI THIS IS TONY BANKS I'M MIKE RUTHERFORD 
PHIL COLLINS WE'RE GENESIS AND YOU'RE LISTENING TO MIX ONE THOUSAND SIXTY FIVE 
FUCK 
HI THIS IS TONY BANKS I'M MIKE RUTHERFORD 
I'M PHIL COLLINS WE'RE GENESIS YOU'RE LISTENING TO MIX ONE HUNDRED FIVE 
I'M A PROFESSIONAL 
THE LAST TEN TWELVE YEARS MORE RECENTLY 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REALLY A LOT LOOSER 
I'M GETTING ON BETTER WITH TONY BANKS NOW THAN I EVER HAVE DONE 
WE ALWAYS GOT ON BUT I REALLY I REALLY FEEL LIKE I UNDERSTAND HIM 
NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME CERTAINLY TO THIS EXTENT 
I'M A LOT MELLOWER THAN I WAS 
YOU KNOW I WAS PRETTY DIFFICULT WHEN HE FIRST KNEW ME 
PERHAPS WE WERE JUST SORT OF CROSSING OVER 
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND DETERMINED TO PROVE YOU'RE RIGHT YOU NEVER SAY 
I DON'T FEEL THAT STRONGLY ABOUT THIS 
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER ABOUT THIRTY WE'D NEVER SAY THAT 
YOU'D ALWAYS SAY OH NO I GO THAT WAY 
SO AS YOU GET OLDER YOU'RE MORE HONEST WITH YOURSELF 
I THINK CERTAINLY WHEN I MET TONY AND MARK THEY WERE BOTH 
VERY HIGHLY STRUNG IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES 
YOU KNOW BEST OF FRIENDS WITH PETE THE WORST OF ENEMIES 
SOMETIMES WHAT IS IN THE BOOK IS 
THAT STEVE AND I WOULD BE WATCHING THIS TENNIS MATCH OF ABUSE 
AND THAT'S ALL KIND OF DISAPPEARED 
HI THIS IS TONY BANKS 
GIRLY HI 
O. K. SORRY YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS

BUT WE NEVER SAW THOSE DOMINOES 
BECAUSE YOU WERE GOING OH FUCK WE'VE FUCKED IT UP 
YOU THOUGHT YOU'D FUCKED UP THE LANDSCAPE 
WE'VE SAT DOWN AND YEAH EXACTLY WE NEED A CUE LIST 
WHICH IS THAT 
WHICH WE SHOULD HAVE FROM SCREENS PRODUCTION WHATEVER THAT IS 
WHICH WE CAN TIE INTO THE SONG WHICH WE THEN PUT INTO THE LYRICS 
WHAT WE WOULD IN T. V. LAND CALL THE SCRIPT 
IT WORRIES ME IF YOU'RE RELYING ON LYRICS OR THINGS LIKE THAT 
OR VISUAL CUES YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO BASE IT ON 
YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE IT IN YOUR HEAD 
YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO YOU'VE GOTTA KNOW THE MUSIC 
YOU'VE GOTTA KNOW THE MUSIC BUT YOU NEED AIDES TO HELP YOU 
YOU NEED 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SOME OF THESE CUES THERE IS NOTHING BUT THE MUSIC 
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THOSE CUE POINTS ARE 
UM 
WHO DOES 
IF YOU WERE A MUSICIAN YOU WOULD KNOW EXACTLY 
WE'VE GOTTA PRACTISE TOMORROW MM H. M. M. 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS HE'S HAVING WAS HE PUT THE WRONG IMAGE UP 
THEN HE COULDN'T GET BACK TO IT TO START AGAIN 
BUT THAT'S THE NATURE OF THAT SYSTEM 
WELL THEN IT'S THE WRONG FUCKING SYSTEM FRANKLY 
WE NEED THAT FLEXIBILITY 
ALL RIGHT THAT'S OUR HOMEWORK FOR TONIGHT 
WE'LL DO THESE NOTES WE HAVE TO HAVE IT RIGHT TOMORROW 
WE'RE IN BIG TROUBLE I THINK 
WE'LL RUN THROUGH IT BUT I'VE CHANGED ALL THE MEDIA THIS IS NOW THE UPRES MEDIA 
I HAVEN'T CHECKED 
OH DO ANOTHER ONE DO ANOTHER ONE 
DO ANOTHER ONE 
DO ANOTHER ONE 
FIVE MINUTES TO CHECK THROUGH WE'RE JUST CHECKING THROUGH RIGHT NOW 
WHAT WAS IT IS THERE A PROBLEM THEY WANT TO DO IT AGAIN 
DO WHAT THEY WANNA DO IT AGAIN 
THEY'VE GOT A TERRIBLE PROBLEM I'D RATHER SEE IT FROM THE BEGINNING 
BUT I. YOU SEEM TO BE THREE CUES AHEAD YOU WENT TO THE LAST CUE 
LET'S JUST LET IF WE CAN GET IT NOW THEN WE'LL KNOW IT'S RIGHT 
HOW ARE YOU GUYS NOW BRIAN WE'RE STANDING BY WHENEVER YOU LIKE 
GO GO GO

AND YOU'RE IN THE WRONG CUE YOU'RE TOO EARLY YOU'RE TOO LATE YOU SAY 
I'M GONNA WAIT LEAVE THE SCREEN BREAK AND JUMP IN ON THE VORTEX CUE 
WHICH HAPPENS TO BE TWO CUES ON DO YOU HAVE TO STEP THROUGH THEM 
OR DO YOU HAVE TO LOAD THEM AND STEP THROUGH THE CUES WHY CAN'T YOU GO BACK 
IT WOULD ALWAYS BE A GO FORWARD NOT A GO BACK 
EVEN JUMP TWO CUES IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT GETTING THERE IN TIME MUCH RATHER SEE AN EMPTY SCREEN 
YOU JUST NEED FUCKING DOMINOES BOUNCING AROUND AT THE END EVEN IF IT'S THE WRONG CUES 
I I I REALLY HONESTLY BELIEVE 
IS GIVE BRIAN THE TIME TO REHEARSE THINGS LIKE DOMINO 
AND GET IT RIGHT ON THE BUTTON
