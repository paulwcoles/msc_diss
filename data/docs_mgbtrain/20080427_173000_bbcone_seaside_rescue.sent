IN LEE ON SOLENT HAMPSHIRE WHISKY BRAVO'S BEEN SCRAMBLED 
FIFTY FIVE FULL PRESSURE 
CLEAR 
A MAN HAS COLLAPSED IN THE ENGINE ROOM OF A TANKER OUT AT SEA AND IS IN A LOT OF PAIN 
PORTSMOUTH ALPHA THIS IS SOLENT COASTGUARD 
WHISKY BRAVO IS AIRBORNE AND PROCEEDING TO THE CASUALTY AT THIS TIME 
HAMPSHIRE AMBULANCE IS BEING TASKED OVER 
PILOT MARK JACKSON AND HIS CREW HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE 
THE WEATHER IS BAD AND A STORM IS COMING 
WE'VE GOT TURBULENCE HELLO 
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A BIT OF A SEA BEARD OVER 
THE SOLENT IS A MAJOR DELIVERY ROUTE FOR CARGO FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
RESCUE WHISKY BRAVO 
PROCEEDING TO POSITION CURRENTLY FIVE HUNDRED FEET 
THAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE THEM NOW 
THE CASUALTY'S ON BOARD THE TANKER ZANTOS EN ROUTE FROM HOLLAND 
OR WE COULD BRING HIM OVER TO THIS SIDE COULDN'T WE 
SO HE'S AT THE HELICOPTER POSITION APPARENTLY 
IS HE RIGHT WHISKY BRAVO IS TOO BIG AND HEAVY TO LAND ON THE DECK OF THE TANKER 
WINCHING IS THE ONLY OPTION 
THEY'RE BRINGING HIM UP NOW HE'S ON THE DECK 
THAT'S THE CASUALTY IS IT YEAH 
OR WE COULD BRING HIM OVER TO THIS SIDE COULDN'T WE 
BUT PLACING THE WINCHMAN WON'T BE EASY WITH ALL THE OBSTRUCTIONS ON DECK 
GET THE WINCH OUT WHILE I'M OVER THE TOP 
YEAH O. K. THEN I'D LIKE TO WINCH TO THE H. 
OH YOU WANT TO GO TO THE H. 
BECAUSE THE FLY AWAY'S FAR BETTER FROM THERE RATHER THAN 
I'LL BE STUCK THIS SIDE AND SIMON WILL BE STUCK THIS SIDE OF ALL THE PIPES O. K. COPY 
SIMON HELLO 
BEAR IN MIND THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF STATIC THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT 
WHISKY BRAVO HAS BUILT UP AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE 
THE TANKER'S CREW ARE TAKING NO CHANCES 
ANY SPARK COULD BE CATASTROPHIC 
BACK ON PERRANPORTH BEACH SARAH'S PAIN IS WORSENING AND SHE'S STARTING TO HYPERVENTILATE 
JUST CONCENTRATE ON ONE THING JUST SLOW YOUR BREATHING DOWN 
I KNOW IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE AND IT'S PROBABLY EXCEPTIONALLY PAINFUL 
STEVE THE OFF DUTY PARAMEDIC HAS DISCOVERED THAT SARAH'S KNEECAP HAS SLIPPED OFF THE BONE 
THE LIGAMENTS AND THE TENDONS ARE ALREADY LOSE AND EVERYTHING'S SLACK SO WITH HER HITTING THE GROUND 
AS WELL SHE COULD HAVE FRACTURED THE KNEECAP WHICH IS ALSO 
A FRACTURED DISLOCATED PATELLA IS NOT PLEASANT AT ALL 
TO AVOID CAUSING MORE PAIN LIFEGUARDS SANDY AND MARK DECIDE NOT TO MOVE HER 
THEY'LL WAIT FOR THE AMBULANCE JUST LOOK AT ME A MINUTE 
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GOING TO GET AN AMBULANCE HERE ALL RIGHT AND THEN THEY CAN DEAL WITH IT 
WE DON'T WANT TO MOVE YOU ANY MORE THAN WE HAVE TO 
COS IT'S GOING TO REALLY HURT TRYING TO MOVE HER WE'LL KEEP HER THERE 
SO RATHER THAN MOVING HER TWICE WE'RE JUST HAVE TO MOVE HER ONCE 
HOPEFULLY IT'S JUST ONE LOT OF PAIN SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH 
SO IT'S SORT OF AN EVOLVING PLAN AS WE GO 
THEY TRY TO FIND SARAH'S FIANCE AND FRIENDS 
CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION IN THE WATER PLEASE 
WE ARE LOOKING FOR A MARK POLLARD AND A MATTHEW POTTER 
IF YOU ARE IN THE WATER AND YOU CAN HEAR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT 
COULD YOU JUST MAKE YOURSELF AWARE TO THE LIFEGUARDS 
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THEM DO YOU KNOW SARAH YEAH 
YEAH O. K. SHE'S DISLOCATED HER KNEE 
OH MY GOD SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

SHE'S ALL RIGHT BUT SHE'S OBVIOUSLY IN A LOT OF PAIN 
SARAH'S FIANCE HAS JUST HEARD THE NEWS 
DO YOU KNOW THIS YOUNG LADY 
YEAH SHE'S MY FIANCEE O. K. SHE'S DISLOCATED HER KNEE 
AS YOU CAN SEE SHE'S PUT HER PATELLA OUT

AND SHE NEEDS TO GET IT TREATED PROPERLY FINE YOU'LL BE O. K. NOW 
I CAN'T REALLY MOVE IT OR FEEL ANYTHING DON'T WORRY YOU'RE IN SHOCK NOW ANYWAY 
THEY'LL BE COMING WITH SOME PAIN RELIEF FOR YOU IN A MINUTE SARAH 
WITH NO SIGN OF THE AMBULANCE ALL THEY CAN DO IS WAIT 
WE ARE CLEAR LEFT AREN'T WE GUYS 
WE ARE CLEAR FROM MY VIEW ON THE LEFT 
YEAH O. K. WE'RE NOW BOARDING 
CREWMAN SIMON O'MAHONY IS BEING WINCHED TO A CASUALTY ON BOARD THE TANKER ZANTOS

PAIN PAIN 
WHEREABOUTS HERE 
LEFT ARE YOU ON SIMON 
YEAH HELLO ARE YOU ALL RIGHT HOW'S THE CASUALTY HE'S BROKEN 
THE TOP PART OF HIS ARM FAIRLY NASTY BREAK 
WINCHING WILL CAUSE THE CASUALTY EVEN MORE PAIN 
BUT AN AIRLIFT IS THE ONLY OPTION 
OH DID THAT HURT 
IT'S GOING TO PROBABLY HURT A BIT THEN 
AS SOON AS WE GET YOU IN THERE I'LL GIVE YOU SOME PAIN RELIEF 
IF IT HURTS TOO MUCH JUST SCREAM REALLY LOUD AND WE'LL STOP THE WINCH O. K. 
IN PERRANPORTH HELP FINALLY ARRIVES FOR SARAH 
IT MAKES A 
FUNNY NOISE THAT'S IT KEEP BREATHING IT IN THE PARAMEDICS GIVE HER SOME PAIN RELIEF 
IT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL A BIT WOOSY SOMETIMES 
WE'RE BASICALLY WE'RE GIVING HER SOME GAS AND AIR AT THE MOMENT WHICH IS LIKE A BIT OF A MUSCLE RELAXANT 
AND A PAIN RELIEVER ALL IN ONE WHICH WILL HELP WITH THE PAIN BUT IT'S NOT A PERMANENT PAIN RELIEVER 
IT ONLY WORKS WHILST YOU'RE BREATHING IT SO WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE IF WE CAN 
GET SOME THE FOURTH ACCESS AND GIVE HER STRONGER PAIN RELIEF GIVE HER SOME MORPHINE AND AN ANTI SICKNESS 
TODAY WAS GOING REALLY WELL UP TILL NOW 
BUT CAN'T DO MUCH ABOUT IT REALLY 
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED IN OCTOBER SO HOPEFULLY IT WILL ALL BE MENDED 
BY THEN OR SHE'LL HAVE TO HOBBLE DOWN THE AISLE A BIT LESS PAIN NOW SHE WAS IN QUITE A BIT OF PAIN 
SHE'S STABILISING BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO MOVE HER OFF THE BEACH 
STEADY HOISTS GOOD ROGER

O. K. RECEIVED SIMON OVER 
IN THE SOLENT THE INJURED SAILOR IS GIVEN INSTANT PAIN RELIEF AND TAKEN TO HOSPITAL 
HIS BROKEN ARM WAS TREATED AND HE WAS ABLE TO RETURN TO THE ZANTOS A FEW DAYS LATER 
I FEEL LIKE I'VE DRUNK ABOUT TEN PINTS 
IT'S TIME TO MOVE SARAH 
JUST RELAX 
HER LEG'S GOT TO BE KEPT STRAIGHT BY THE SPLINT SO THE EASIEST WAY WE THINK TO TRANSPORT HER IS TO SIT HER 
IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK HERE WITH HER LEG OUT STRAIGHT 
WITH HER BACK AGAINST THE BACK OF THE GLASS THERE 
THAT'S THE PLAN ANYWAY 
KEEP YOUR ARMS NICE AND TIGHT ACROSS YOUR TUMMY 
ONE TWO THREE UP YOU COME 
AAAGH AAGH 
DESPITE THE HEAVY DOSE OF MORPHINE THE MOVE IS STILL AGONY AAAGH 
AAH AAH

ALL RIGHT YEAH 
THAT'S THE WORST BIT COS WE'LL GET THE TROLLEY OUT LEVEL NEXT AND WE'LL SLIDE YOU ON THE LEVEL 
AFTER TWO EXCRUCIATING HOURS SARAH IS FINALLY ON HER WAY 
AT YARMOUTH HARBOUR ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT THE FORTY FOUR TONNE 
ALL WEATHER LIFEBOAT IS ON PERMANENT STAND BY FOR OFF SHORE RESCUES 
MAYDAY RELAY MAYDAY RELAY

JAYNE SHEREE A THIRTY ONE FOOT 
WESTLEY SAILING VESSEL WITH POB 
SUFFERED ENGINE FAILURE AND REEFING DIFFICULTIES 
A FRIGHTENED CHILD ABOARD 
REQUEST IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE 
RNLI COXSWAIN HOWARD LEICESTER AND HIS CREW TAKE LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES TO LAUNCH 
WE'VE BEEN OUT ON MAYDAY FOR SOME TIME NOW 
MARK YEAH HOW MANY PEOPLE ON BOARD 
THREE THREE PERSONS ON BOARD 
A MAN A WOMAN AND A CHILD 
TWO WARSHIPS HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE YACHT 
BUT THE CASUALTIES WERE PANICKING AND GAVE THE WRONG CO ORDINATES 
LUCKILY A CROSS CHANNEL FERRY HAS SPOTTED THEM AND CONTACTS THE COASTGUARD 
YARMOUTH LIFEBOAT THE NEW CURRENT POSITION OF THE CASUALTY 
FIVE ZERO DEGREES TWO NINE DECIMAL NINE MINUTES NORTH 
TWO DECIMAL ZERO NINE MINUTES WEST OVER 
WITH THE NEW INFORMATION THE LIFEBOAT QUICKLY LOCATES THE JAYNE SHEREE 
WITH NO ENGINE POWER THE YACHT IS AT THE MERCY OF THE HIGH WINDS 
THE FERRY HAS BEEN CIRCLING TO BREAK UP THE HUGE WAVES THAT THREATEN TO CAPSIZE THE YACHT 
O. K. WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR DINGHY IN THE WATER AND PUT A COUPLE OF CREW ON BOARD WITH YOU 
THEN THE PLAN WILL BE TO TAKE YOU THREE OFF O. K. 
THE PLAN IS TO PUT TWO OF OUR CREW ON BOARD AND TAKE THESE PEOPLE OFF 
IN THESE ROUGH SEAS GETTING CLOSE TO THE YACHT 
IS PROVING DIFFICULT 
THE AFTERNOON AT PERRANPORTH SEES BAD WEATHER STARTING TO MAKE ITS WAY INSHORE 
THERE ARE LESS PEOPLE ON THE BEACH 
AND LIFEGUARD MARK BREWER IS ENJOYING A BIT OF DOWNTIME 
PERRANPORTH BASE PERRANPORTH BASE 
YEAH WE'VE GOT A KID STUCK ON THE CLIFF BUT NOT FOR LONG 
I'LL GIVE YOU AN UPDATE IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES OVER 
ANOTHER JOB FOR MARK ONLY THIS TIME IT'S INLAND 
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD TOM HAS TAKEN A WRONG TURN 
SAW THIS LAD UP THERE HE LOOKED AT ME SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED ROUND AS IF TO SAY OH DEAR 
BIT OF A DAFT THING TO BE DOING BUT HOLIDAYS AND ALL THAT 
THIS CHAP HERE'S CLIMBED UP 
AND IT'S QUITE A STEEP FACE 
BUT HE'S GOT UP SO FAR HE'S NOT GOING TO GET BACK DOWN AGAIN 
HIS FRIEND'S MOTHER ISN'T AMUSED 
HE'S A FRIEND OF MY SON CONNOR 
AND CLEARLY CONNOR COULD COME DOWN AND TOM COULDN'T 
SO HE'S STUCK UP THERE HIS MOTHER'S GONNA KILL ME 
HE CLIMBED UP TO THERE AND I TOLD HIM HE SHOULD PROBABLY GET DOWN BECAUSE FROM THERE THERE ISN'T A WAY DOWN AND 
HE SAID THAT IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND IT WASN'T 
THERE ISN'T ANOTHER SIDE 
TOM KIND OF LIKES DOING STUPID THINGS 
IT'S JUST KIND OF DISBELIEF THAT HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN SO STUPID TO DO THAT 
HALF OF ME WANTS HIM TO FALL YO RE SO C. R. E. L. 
WELL NOT A DEATH FALL ONLY LIKE A BROKEN LEG FALL 
MARK'S QUIET AFTERNOON HAS GONE OUT OF THE WINDOW 
THE TOP OF THE CLIFF STEPS WILL GIVE A CLEAR VIEW OF THE SITUATION 
AND MAY SHED SOME LIGHT ON HOW TO GET TOM DOWN YEAH DON'T JUMP 
IN THE SOLENT THE INFLATABLE HAS BEEN LAUNCHED 
IN THESE CONDITIONS IT'S A DANGEROUS MANOEUVRE 
THEY'RE SUFFERING FROM SEA SICKNESS AND WITH A CHILD ON BOARD IT'S ER PANICKY 
THE CASUALTIES ARE EXHAUSTED 
THEIR ENGINE FAILED YESTERDAY AND THEY'VE BEEN OUT ALL NIGHT BEING BUFFETED BY THE WAVES 
WELL WE'VE GOT ALL OF THE THREE CASUALTY CREW OFF 
WE'VE GOT TWO OF OUR OWN CREW ON BOARD ONCE WE RECOVER THE WIRE AND PUT IT BACK ON THE ROOF 
WE'RE ESTABLISH A TOW AND TOW THE BOAT BACK INTO YARMOUTH 
YARMOUTH COASTGUARD YARMOUTH LIFEBOAT 
YES WE NOW HAVE THE THREE PERSONS 
OF THE CASUALTY VESSELS ABOARD THE LIFEBOAT 
BACK AT THE YARMOUTH THE CASUALTIES ARE RELIEVED TO BE ON DRY LAND 
I'VE NEVER BEEN SEASICK IN MY LIFE AND I FELT REALLY ILL TO BE HONEST 
AND YOU DID DIDN'T YOU YOU'VE NEVER FELT ILL BEFORE HAVE YOU 
I JUST FELT RELIEVED 
THAT WE'RE SAFE NOW YEAH 
THE COASTGUARD DISCOVERED THAT THE SKIPPER ONLY BOUGHT 
THE BOAT YESTERDAY AND WAS SAILING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
WITH THE ENGINE REPAIRED THEY SET SAIL THE NEXT DAY ON CALMER WATERS 
BACK AT PERRANPORTH LIFEGUARD MARK'S AFTERNOON TASK IS PROVING TO BE DIFFICULT 
TOM IS STILL STUCK UP THE CLIFF 
MARK CALLS HIS SUPERVISOR ANDY THOMAS FOR A SECOND OPINION 
YEAH THE PROBLEM WE'VE GOT IS THERE'S THIS GRASS BANK JUST ABOVE WHERE HE IS THERE'S A GRASS BANK 
I DON'T WANT HIM CLIMBING UP THAT COS I'M SURE THAT'S GOING TO BE SLIPPY 
THERE'S LOTS OF SHALE THERE SO IF HE TRIES THAT HE'S GOING TO SLIP 
HE CAN'T GO BACK DOWN THE WAY HE'S COME UP COS THERE'S NOT MANY VERY GOOD FOOTHOLDS 
I DON'T THINK HE'LL BE ABLE TO CLIMB UP OVER ROUND THE OTHER SIDE 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM OVER 
YOU ALL RIGHT TOM HE'S NOT THAT FAR UP 
BUT HE NEEDS TO COME DOWN AND WE CAN'T GET HIM DOWN 
WHAT AN IDIOT 
IT'S A JOB FOR THE CLIFF RESCUE TEAM 
CAN YOU BRING YOUR LEG ACROSS TO THE LEFT THERE 
UP TO THE COASTGUARD NOW WE'LL PASS IT TO THE COASTGUARD THEY'LL BE TAKING CONTROL OF THE SITUATION 
TRY AND GET IN A RELAXED POSITION SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FALL 
OTHERWISE YOUR ARMS ARE GOING TO FEEL REALLY TIRED AND YOUR LEGS ARE GOING TO FEEL REALLY TIRED 
THE POSITION HE'S IN IT'S NOT A VERY RELAXED POSITION 
HE'S HAVING TO TENSE HIMSELF UP TO ACTUALLY STAY THERE AND OVER A LONG 
PERIOD OF TIME YOUR MUSCLES ARE GOING TO GET WEAK AND SORE 
JUST TRY AND GET IN A COMFORTABLE POSITION 
TOM'S BEEN UP THERE FOR AN HOUR NOW 
WHISKY BRAVO HAS BEEN SCRAMBLED AGAIN 
PILOT SIMON HORNSBY HAS BEEN TASKED TO AN EMERGENCY AT LULWORTH COVE 
A POPULAR DIVING SPOT ON THE SOUTH COAST DO YOU HAVE 
A BRIEF INDICATION OF WHAT THE TROUBLE IS 
DIVER THIRTY NINE YEAR OLD MALE WHO'S DIVING AT THIRTY FIVE METRES FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
DUE TO A COMPUTER FAULT APPARENTLY HE MISSED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES WITH STOPS 
DIVER HAS BEEN ON OXYGEN OVER 
A DEEP SEA DIVER HAS BEEN SHOWING SIGNS OF THE BENDS 
A CONDITION WHERE NITROGEN BUBBLES ACCUMULATE IN THE BLOOD 
IT CAN BE FATAL AS WINCHMAN TERRY SHORT KNOWS 
IT COULD START OFF WITH TINGLING TO START OFF WITH AND THEN IT CAN GET VERY PAINFUL 
IF IT'S ANYWHERE NEAR THE SPINAL CORD THEN PARALYSIS COULD SET IN AS WELL 
SO IT'S IMPERATIVE REALLY THAT WE GET HIM TO A DECOMPRESSION 
CHAMBER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO CLEAR THE SYSTEM OF THESE BUBBLES 
WHISKY BRAVO WHISKY BRAVO 
HIS CONDITION SEEMS TO BE WORSENING 
GOOD AFTERNOON WHISKY BRAVO 
THE DIVER CONCERNED IS VOMITING NOW 
EVERY SECOND COUNTS 
I KNOW WHAT HEADING HE'S ON AT THE MOMENT BUT I CAN SEE SOMETHING THAT'S COMING NORTHEAST 
THAT MUST BE MAKING A REASONABLE SPEED 
AND THAT'S AT FOUR MILES EIGHT HUNDRED FEET 
O. K. LOOKING AT IT YOU'VE GOT THE CABIN AND YOU'VE GOT 
THE DIVE DECK ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE ON YOUR STARBOARD SIDE 
APART FROM THAT IT LOOKS QUITE CLEAR 
THE SAFEST WAY TO RETRIEVE THE CASUALTY IS FOR WHISKY BRAVO 
AND THE BOAT TO TRAVEL IN FORMATION AT THE SAME SPEED 
ALL THE GEAR AND WINCHING OUT ROGER 
THIS IS A HIGHLY SKILLED MANOEUVRE REQUIRING GREAT PRECISION 
CAN YOU CLEAR FORWARD AND RIGHT AS WELL 
FORWARD AND RIGHT SIX 
FORWARD AND RIGHT FIVE 
FORWARD AND RIGHT FOUR 
FORWARD TWO AND RIGHT 
FORWARD ONE AND RIGHT 
ON THE STERN AND STEADY STEADY 
FORWARD ONE FORWARD ONE AND STEADY 
STEADY STEADY STEADY 
ON THE DECK STEADY STEADY 
CLEAR BACK FOR THIS ONE HOOK IS CLEAR 
TERRY IS HIMSELF AN EXPERIENCED DIVER AND KNOWS THE WARNING SIGNS 
YOU'VE GOT ALL THE PARTICULARS HAVE YOU 
THE DIVE DETAILS ARE ESSENTIAL TO KNOW HOW MUCH RE COMPRESSION HE'LL NEED 
AND WITH A DIVE CHAMBER TWENTY MILES WAY THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE 
BACK AT PERRANPORTH THE COASTGUARD RESCUE TEAM HAVE ARRIVED 
BUT HEAVY RAIN IS MAKING THE SITUATION EVEN MORE DANGEROUS 
IT'S GETTING SLIPPING BECAUSE OF THE RAIN SO JUST GET A REALLY GOOD GRIP 
THESE ROCKS ARE WELL SLIPPY NOW SO DON'T TRY AND MOVE 
WELL THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE'VE GOT HERE IS ACCESS IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT PLACE TO GET TO AND ALSO 
THE YOUNG MAN THERE AS YOU CAN SEE IS IN A VERY PRECARIOUS POSITION 
SO TIME IS NOT REALLY AT OUR ADVANTAGE AT THE MOMENT 
NORMALLY THE COASTGUARD TEAM WORK FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFF 
AND THEY'LL PUT A LINE DOWN FROM THE TOP 
THE PROBLEM WE'VE GOT HERE IS HE'S NOT ACTUALLY ON THE MAIN BIT 
OF THE CLIFF HE'S ON AN OUTCROP SO THEY CAN'T BRING A LINE DOWN 
WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS CALL FOR A HELICOPTER 
YEAH FOR YOUR INFORMATION RESCUE ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE HAVE BEEN TASKED FOR THE KID ON THE CLIFF OVER 
WHAT STARTED AS A MINOR INCIDENT AT PERRANPORTH IS TURNING INTO A MAJOR RESCUE OPERATION 
RIGHT HE'S COME ON TO THE DECK HE'S DOING SOME STOPS 
TAKE THE POWER SHORTLY AND I'LL START DESCENDING 
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS ON THE WAY UP JUST PULL THAT DOWN AND INFLATE YOUR JACKET 
FORWARD BY ONE 
AND WINCHING CLEAR 
YOU'RE CLEAR TO THE LEFT 
WINCHING IN I'VE GOT TWENTY FOOT OF CABLE 
I'M GOING TO INCREASE SPEED A LITTLE BIT TO GET SOME PERFORMANCE 
JUST NEED TO BOARD THE AIRCRAFT 
TURNING ROUND 
THROUGH THE DOORWAY 
THE DIVER IS GIVEN OXYGEN IN CASE HIS CONDITION DETERIORATES EN ROUTE 
DIVER'S ON BOARD WE ROUTING NOW TO POOLE 
WHISKY BRAVO'S QUICK RESPONSE SAVED THE DIVER'S LIFE 
AFTER FIVE HOURS OF THE DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER HE MADE A FULL RECOVERY 
CAN I HAVE EVERYBODY BEHIND THIS VEHICLE PLEASE 
AT THE BEACH TEENAGER TOM IS ABOUT TO WITNESS THE FULL IMPACT OF TODAY'S LITTLE CLIMBING EXPEDITION 
IF YOU COULD ALL MAKE YOUR WAY PAST THE RED LAND ROVER I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU 
NOW THE ROYAL NAVY ARE INVOLVED 
BUT IT'S A TEN TONNE SEA KING WHICH WILL CREATE A MASSIVE DOWN WASH 
IT'S IMPERATIVE TO CHECK THAT THEY CAN HOVER CLOSE ENOUGH 
WITHOUT BLOWING TOM OFF THE CLIFF 
LET US KNOW HOW MUCH DOWN WASH WE ARE PRODUCING 
TOM'S CLINGING ON FOR DEAR LIFE WE'LL BE RUNNING IN TO GET THE CASUALTY OFF THE ROCK 
THE HELICOPTER'S GOING TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO MOVE THE CASUALTY OVER 
THE HELICOPTER HAS NOW LIFTED OFF THE ONE CASUALTY UNINJURED OVER 
SHE'S GONNA HIT ME 
YOU IDIOT 
TOLD YOU SO YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT 
IT'S ALL RIGHT IT WASN'T IT WAS KIND OF LIKE BAD BUT IT WAS ALL RIGHT 
IT WAS PRETTY FUN GOING ON THE HELICOPTER AND STUFF 
HE'S ON A LEAD FROM NOW ON 
SHOULD HAVE LEFT HIM UP THERE 
ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE TO MOBILE DO YOU READ 
OVER NICE ONE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH OVER 
ROGER THAT HAVE A NICE DAY 
AAGH AAAGH I NEED TO KEEP MY KNEE OUT THE WATER 
SARAH'S KNEE WAS PUT BACK INTO PLACE AT CASUALTY BUT NOT WITHOUT MORE DRAMA 
AAAGH 
IT WAS INCREDIBLY PAINFUL 
THE NURSE BENT IT THAT WAY AND AS IT BENT I THINK THE KNEECAP WAS PUSHED BACK UP THAT WAY 
APPARENTLY YOU COULD HEAR YOU FROM THE WAITING ROOM 
I SCREAMED QUITE A BIT AND WAS PROMPTLY MOVED TO A SIDE ROOM 
SO THAT THE OTHER PATIENTS WOULDN'T HEAR 
BUT SHE WAS ABLE TO WALK UP THE AISLE ON HER SPECIAL DAY 
AND AS FOR TOM TO REPENT FOR THE TEN THOUSAND FIASCO THAT HE CAUSED 
A SPONSORED SILENCE HAS BEEN ARRANGED FOR HIM BY HIS MUM 
HE CAN HAVE A LITTLE PAD ROUND HIS NECK AND A PEN AND PEOPLE 
WILL BUY MINUTES OF SILENCE FROM TOM 
BECAUSE ACTUALLY I THINK THERE'LL BE QUITE A FEW TAKERS FOR THAT ONE 
ALREADY THE SCALE OF THE RESCUE OPERATION IS STARTING TO DAWN ON HIM 
I FELT A BIT GUILTY BECAUSE I WAS GETTING A HELICOPTER OUT 
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY AND EFFORT THAT COULD HAVE GONE TO SOMEONE ELSE 
LOOKING BACK MAYBE I WOULD HAVE DONE IT DIFFERENTLY 
NEXT TIME ON SEASIDE RESCUE VICTOR ALPHA IS SCRAMBLED AS A WOMAN COLLAPSES AT THE BOTTOM OF A CLIFF 
THAT'S THE CLOSEST WE WANT TO GO ROGER RIGHT GIVE US YOUR HAND 
AND IN PERRANPORTH A SURFER BATTLES AGAINST LIFE THREATENING CURRENTS 
WHERE DID THEY GO THEY'RE COMING
