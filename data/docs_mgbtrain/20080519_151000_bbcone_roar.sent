A LOVE BUG HITS THE ANIMAL PARK AND THESE AMOROUS ANTEATERS 
SEEM TO HAVE CAUGHT IT 
AND POO WHAT A STINKER 
WE FIND OUT WHY RHINO DUNG HOLDS A SECRET MESSAGE 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO ANOTHER EXCITING EDITION OF ROAR 
GET MY BREATH BACK 
I'M RANI AND THAT'S MILO 
HE'S A TWO YEAR OLD MALE BARBARY LION HERE AT PORT LYMPNE 
YOU CAN USUALLY IDENTIFY MALE LIONS FROM THEIR HANDSOME MANES 
BUT MILO HASN'T REACHED MATURITY 
SO HE'S GOT A BIT OF WORK TO DO ON THE MANE GROWING DEPARTMENT 
WHEN BARBARY LION MANES GROW IT REALLY DOES GROW 
THEIR MANE IS ROUND THEIR HEAD 
ON THEIR CHEST AND DOWN TO THEIR STOMACHS 
THAT'S A HAIR RAISING FACT 
AND WE'VE GOT LOADS MORE OF THOSE COMING UP ON TODAY'S SHOW 
WE START OVER AT HOWLETTS WILD ANIMAL PARK 
WHERE THEY'RE HAVING A SUMMER OF LOVE 
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK THE ANIMALS ARE GETTING SOPPY AND ROMANTIC 
THE SNOW LEOPARDS ARE ENJOYING A SNUGGLE 
THE KUDUS ARE COSYING UP AND 
THE ANTEATERS HAVE GONE ONE BETTER AND HAVE MOVED IN WITH ONE ANOTHER 
IN THE WILD ANTEATERS ARE SOLITARY ANIMALS 
THEY MEET MATE AND GO ON THEIR OWN SEPARATE WAYS WHICH MAKES THESE GUYS 
LIVING TOGETHER TRULY REMARKABLE 
AND THEIR LOVE AFFAIR ALL THE MORE SPECIAL 
KEEPER ALICE ELLIOTT HAS BEEN WATCHING THE RELATIONSHIP DEVELOP 
THE FIRST CONTACT WAS NOSE TO NOSE THROUGH THE BARS 
HE USED TO STICK HIS SNOUT THROUGH AND SNIFF HER 
HIS LITTLE TONGUE WOULD COME OUT AND GO ALL OVER HER 
AT FIRST SHE WOULDN'T NOTICE THEN SHE WAS LIKE WHAT'S THAT 
THEN SHE'D REALISE IT WAS HIM AND MOVE AWAY 
IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR THEM TO GET TO WHERE THEY ARE NOW 
THE REALLY GOOD SIGN THAT THEY WERE GETTING ON 
WAS WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED TO SLEEP IN THE SAME BED 
TO START WITH WE CAME IN ONE DAY AND THEY WERE 
BOTH IN THE SAME BED BUT AT OPPOSITE ENDS AS FAR APART AS POSSIBLE 
GRADUALLY THEY'VE GOT CLOSER AND CLOSER AND NOW SOMETIMES YOU 
COME IN AND THEY'RE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER JUST SLIGHTLY TOUCHING 
BUT VERY SWEET 
HOW DO YOU TELL IF AN ANTEATER IS IN LOVE 
DOES HE SAY IT WITH CHOCOLATES FLOWERS POETRY 
NO THESE FURRIES PREFER TO WRESTLE 
YOU DON'T SEE IT VERY OFTEN BUT THEY DO PLAY FIGHT SOMETIMES 
ROLL ABOUT CHASE EACH OTHER ROUND 
YOU CAN TELL WHEN IT'S FRIENDLY AND WHEN IT'S NOT 
IT'S IS JUST LIKE A COUPLE OF KIDS PLAYING AROUND 
THEY'RE ENJOYING EACH OTHER'S COMPANY 
AND THEY EAT OUT OF THE SAME BOWL AS WELL 
THEY GET TWO FOOD BOWLS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO 
BUT NORMALLY THEY GO TO THE SAME BOWL 
WHEN THEY COME IN IN THE EVENING 
THEY'LL HAVE THEIR DINNER OUT THE SAME BOWL STAND SIDE BY SIDE 
BOTH SNOUTS IN THE TROUGH JUST SLURPING 
SO THEY SHARE A BED LIKE AN AFFECTIONATE WRESTLE 
AND ENJOY A ROMANTIC BOWL OF SLOP TOGETHER 
WHAT'S NEXT FOR THESE TWO LOVEBIRDS 
HEAD OF SECTION JOEL HAS HIS SUSPICIONS 
THEY WERE SEEN MATING 
NEARLY SIX MONTHS AGO SO WITH A BIT OF LUCK WITHIN FOUR TO SIX WEEKS 
SHE COULD POSSIBLY GIVE BIRTH 
WE DON'T KNOW SHE'S PREGNANT FOR DEFINITE 
IT'S VERY HARD TO TELL 
THEY'RE VERY HAIRY 
SO HAVE A LOT OF WEIGHT GAIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF TEATS 
AND THAT SORT OF THING 
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WE'RE JUST GUESSING AT THE MOMENT AND HOPING 
SO JUST HOW CAN YOU TELL IF AN ANTEATER IS PREGNANT 
I'LL GIVE YOU A CLUE 
YOU CALL THE FIRE BRIGADE 
WE'LL BE BACK LATER IN THE SHOW TO FIND OUT WHY 
HOW DO YOU MAKE A SIBERIAN TIGER WORK FOR HIS DINNER 
ON THE OTHER END OF THIS LADDER 
CHRIS OUR BIG CAT KEEPER SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD IDEA 
CHRIS WE'RE IN THE TIGER ENCLOSURE AREN'T WE RIGHT NOW YES INDEED 
WHERE ARE THE TIGERS 
YOU'RE PERFECTLY SAFE THEY'RE IN THE SHUT OFF AREA JUST OVER HERE 
NO NEED TO WORRY AT ALL IT'S ALL LOCKED AND WE'RE SAFE YES 
WE HAVE A LADDER WITH US 
YOU'VE SOME MEAT WITH YOU WHAT ARE WE ACTUALLY DOING TODAY 
WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE FEED UP THERE 
THIS ISN'T A REAL TREE IS IT THIS PART HERE IS JUST A TELEGRAPH POLE 
THAT WE PUT INTO THE GROUND WE'RE ONLY GOING TO PUT 
ONE PIECE OF MEAT UP HERE AND THEN WE'RE GOING 
TO PUT ANOTHER PIECE UP ONE OF THESE TREES HERE 
THE REASON BEING IS THAT TUG DOES NOT LIKE TO GO UP TREES 
INGRID DOESN'T LIKE TO GO UP THE TELEGRAPH POLE SO WE HAVE 
TO PUT ONE PIECE UP EACH SO THEY BOTH GO UP THEY'RE FUSSY 
YOU'VE GOT THE MEAT SHALL I HOLD THIS LADDER FOR YOU 
YES PLEASE AS I CLIMB UP IT IF YOU CAN STAND AT THE BOTTOM THERE 
MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE THAT WILL BE GREAT 
UP HE GOES 
WILL TUG SEE YOU DOING THIS NOW AND WILL HE BE EAGER TO RUN UP 
THEY'RE BOTH AT THE FENCE THERE SO THEY'VE BOTH SEEN THIS THEY KNOW 
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING DO YOU TIE IT ON 
WE'VE THESE PEGS SO IT HANGS OVER HOPEFULLY IT WILL STAY THERE 
WHY WOULD YOU PUT THEIR DINNER UP THERE BECAUSE THAT SEEMS A BIT MEAN 
IT'S NOT THAT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY LIKE CLIMBING TREES 
IT'S JUST THAT THEY DON'T DO IT 
ALL THE PREY THEY CHASE AFTER IS ON THE GROUND 
THEY DON'T NEED TO THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF CASES OF PEOPLE 
RUNNING AWAY FROM THE TIGERS IN THE WILD 
AND CLIMBING UP THE TREE TO GET AWAY FROM THEM 
AND THE TIGER FOLLOWED THEM UP IT 
AND THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY GET AWAY AT ALL 
IT'S A BIT SCARY IT'S A BIT SCARY 
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S MAKING ME CARRY THE LADDER WHAT A GENTLEMAN 
HOW ABOUT UP THIS ONE THAT LOOKS GOOD TO ME 
THIS IS FOR INGRID IT IS YES 
WHO'S THE MOST AGILE OUT OF THE PAIR 
INGRID BY FAR NORMALLY WHEN WE LET HER OUT 
SHE COMES BOUNDING OVER AND RUNS UP THE TREE AS IF IT'S NOT THERE 
TUG HE LOOKS ALL AROUND THE CLOSURE THINKING 
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO UP THERE 
HE LOOKS TO SEE IF WE'VE PUT ANY ANYWHERE ELSE 
AND EVENTUALLY RESIGNS HIMSELF TO IT 
SIBERIAN TIGERS FROM SIBERIA I'M GUESSING EASTERN RUSSIA 
IT'S QUITE COLD THERE ISN'T IT IT'S VERY COLD SO THIS ENVIRONMENT 
IS PERFECT FOR THEM WE GET NICE COLD WINTERS HERE 
NOT AS COLD AS SIBERIA BUT IT'S STILL VERY NICE FOR THEM 
IT MEANS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE HOT AND FLUSTERED ALL THE TIME 
AND ALSO DURING OUR SUMMERS THEY JUST LAY DOWN 
THROUGHOUT THE DAYTIME STAYING COOL 
ARE WE ALL SET UP THERE CHRIS YEAH 
I THINK WE SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE AND LET THE TIGERS OUT 
YOU COME BACK LATER IN THE SHOW TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS 
WHAT'S A SLUG I DON'T KNOW 
A SNAIL WITH A HOUSING PROBLEM 
I DON'T GET IT 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FROG WHEN IT BROKE DOWN 
IT GOT TOAD AWAY 
WHAT KIND OF DOG LIKES TO TAKE BUBBLE BATHS 
A SHAM POODLE 
I'M INSIDE THE TAPIER ENCLOSURE 
WITH DEPUTY HEAD OF HOOF STOCK STUART JONES 
WE'VE COME OVER TO HELP WITH SOME RHINO ENRICHMENT 
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS COLLECT SOME 
POO FROM THESE GUYS THE TAPIERS 
CAN I STOP YOU THERE YEAH 
COLLECT SOME POO COLLECT SOME POO WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE DOING THAT FOR 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS PLACE IT IN THE RHINO ENCLOSURE 
AND HOPEFULLY THE SCENT OF THESE GUYS POO 
WILL STIMULATE SOME SORT OF BEHAVIOUR OUT OF THEM 
THAT WILL BE FASCINATING 
A BIT OF A TEST REALLY O. K. 
WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME OF YOUR POO ALL RIGHT OVER HERE 
THERE'S A BIG PILE OVER HERE 
HAVE YOU PUT THAT POO THERE OR IS THIS A HABIT FOR THEM 
THESE PARTICULAR TAPIERS FORM A MIDDEN 
A MIDDEN IS A WORD FOR A LARGE PILE OF POO 
IN THE WILD IT OFTEN MARKS THE EDGE OF AN ANIMALS' TERRITORY 
WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT RHINOS DO A LOT OF TIMES 
THEY'LL GO IN THE WATER AS WELL BUT THESE GUYS THEY FORM THEIR MIDDENS 
IT'S EASIER FOR US TO COLLECT 
FROM HERE THAN FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE POND 
YOU FEED THEM SOME BANANA 
AND I'LL DIG UP SOME POO WHILE YOU DISTRACT THEM 
THIS IS HEAVY STUFF 
D'YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOESN'T SMELL THAT BAD 
IT'S NOT TOO BAD ACTUALLY IS IT 
TAPIERS ARE VEGETARIANS SO THEIR POO IS NOT THAT SMELLY 
OBVIOUSLY IF WE WERE COLLECTING CARNIVORE POO WHERE THEY EAT MEAT 
THAT'S REALLY SMELLY 
HAVE WE GOT ENOUGH THERE IF WE GET A COUPLE OF SCOOPS 
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE IT AWAY 
ONE MORE SHOVEL FULL 
THAT'S A PRETTY SERIOUS BUCKET OF POO 
WILL THAT DO YES 
GREAT STUFF JOIN US LATER AND WE'LL FIND OUT 
WHAT THE BLACK RHINO MAKE OF THEIR SMELLY ENRICHMENT SURPRISE 
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED AT HOWLETTS WILD ANIMAL PARK 
AND THE FIRE BRIGADE HAVE BEEN CALLED 
KENT'S FINEST ARE ON THEIR WAY TO 
THE ANTEATER HOUSE THOUGH FORTUNATELY IT'S NOT COS OF A FIRE 
EARLIER WE HEARD HOW THE FLAMES 
OF LOVE HAD BEEN FOUND BETWEEN TWO ANTEATERS CALLED MR. AND MRS. LOUIE 
FIREFIGHTER SCOTT PEARCE AND HIS TEAM ARE HERE 
IN ANSWER TO A BURNING QUESTION 
WE'RE WHITE WATCH CANTERBURY 
WE'RE BASED AT THE LOCAL FIRE STATION IN THE CITY 
WE'VE COME ALONG TODAY TO HOPEFULLY USE OUR THERMAL IMAGE CAMERA TO 
ASCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT THE FEMALE GIANT ANTEATER IS PREGNANT 
THE THERMAL IMAGE CAMERA IS THE LATEST FIRE FIGHTING TECHNOLOGY 
WHEN POINTED AT AN AREA 
IT CAN DETECT EVEN A TINY TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE IF MRS. LOUIE IS PREGNANT 
THE BABY INSIDE SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN SHE IS 
POINTING THE CAMERA AT HER BELLY 
COULD REVEAL A BABY ANTEATER SHAPED HOT SPOT 
BUT WHAT IT USUALLY USED FOR 
GENERALLY WE USE IT TO TRY AND ASCERTAIN AT A FIRE IF THERE 
ARE ANY HOT SPOTS ANYWHERE ONCE FIRE FIGHTING OPERATIONS ARE OVER 
WE SEND GUYS IN WITH THE THERMAL IMAGE CAMERA 
AND CHECK TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY HOT SPOTS WE NEED TO EXTINGUISH 
IT IS VERY VALUABLE TO TAKE INTO THE FIRE IF SOMEBODY IS MISSING 
WE CAN USE THAT EQUIPMENT TO FIND THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE 
IN MAYBE A DARK SMOKE FILLED ROOM 
AND THEN WE CAN GO STRAIGHT TO THEM AND RESCUE THEM 
IN NEARLY TWELVE YEARS OF BEING A FIREFIGHTER IT'S THE FIRST 
TIME WE'VE COME TO THE ZOO FOR ANY CALL OUT 
ESPECIALLY TO FIND OUT IF SOMEBODY IS PREGNANT 
IT MUST BE THE FIRST TIME THESE ANTEATERS HAVE SEEN SO MANY FIREMEN 
KEEPER JOEL CAN'T WAIT TO GET STARTED 
BOTH ANTEATERS ARE ASLEEP SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO 
WALK STRAIGHT UP TO THEM POINT THE EQUIPMENT AT THEM AND GET A 
SHOT OF THEIR INSIDES HOPEFULLY 
WE'LL COMPARE THE MALE AND FEMALE 
HOPEFULLY WHAT THE MALE MIGHT LACK THE FEMALE MIGHT HAVE INSIDE OF HER 
AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO TELL THAT WAY 
THESE ARE OUR TWO GIANT ANTEATERS 
THE FEMALE IS THE ONE ON THE LEFT 
AND THE MALE THERE JUST WOKEN UP 
PICKING UP 
ZERO POINT TWO THREE DEGREES 
AND THAT ONE THERE TWENTY TWO DEGREES 
CAN YOU SEE ANY HOT SPOTS THERE 
HEADS AND THE NOSES ARE SHOWING UP AS RED ON THE CAMERA 
WHAT WE REALLY NEED ARE HOT SPOTS ON THE BODY ITSELF 
IF THEY WERE UP AND ABOUT AND MOVING ABOUT WE COULD SEE A BIT MORE O. K. 
PARK VET JANE IS KEEN TO FIND OUT WHAT THE CAMERA REVEALS 
HELLO JOEL 
HOW ARE THE ANTEATERS DOING THEY'RE SLEEPY 
THEY'RE O. K. 
WE'VE JUST HAD A QUICK LOOK BUT ALL WE CAN SEE IS THE TEMPERATURES 
ON THEIR HEADS AND NOSES THEY'RE TOO CURLED UP TO GET A READING 
WE'LL WAKE THE FEMALE UP AND SEE WHAT OCCURS 
GOOD GIRL ALL RIGHT SWEETHEART 
IF SHE WAS PREGNANT HOW FAR ALONG WOULD SHE BE 
FROM THE MATINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN SHE SHOULD BE A MONTH 
MAYBE SIX WEEKS AT THE MOST 
IS THERE ANY KIND OF COMPARISON WITH THE MALE 
BOTH PRETTY MUCH THE SAME 
IS HIS ABDOMEN THE SAME TEMPERATURE YES O. K. 
UNFORTUNATELY TIME HAS RUN OUT THE FIREMEN HAVE BEEN CALLED AWAY 
TO DEAL WITH AN EMERGENCY 
IT WASN'T CONCLUSIVE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW ANY MORE 
IT DOESN'T RULE HER OUT BEING PREGNANT 
BECAUSE IT WAS QUITE AN EXPERIMENTAL THING 
SHE COULD BE QUITE HEAVILY PREGNANT AND IT JUST WOULDN'T SHOW UP 
DEFINITELY WORTH DOING VERY INTERESTING BUT 
FRUSTRATINGLY WE STILL DON'T KNOW 
SO IF THIS EXTRAORDINARY LOVE AFFAIR HAS PRODUCED A BABY 
IT'S A SECRET THE TWO ANTEATERS ARE KEEPING TO THEMSELVES 
WE'LL BE BACK LATER IN THE SERIES WITH ANY NEWS 
HAVE YOU BEEN PLAYING THE ROAR GAME ON THE CBBC WEBSITE 
THE IDEA IS TO MAINTAIN AND RUN THE BEST POSSIBLE WILD ANIMAL PARK 
EVERY DAY WE GIVE YOU A SECRET CODE TO UNLOCK SPECIAL FEATURES 
AND TODAY'S CODE IS ON THE SCREEN NOW 
HAPPY GAMING 
NOW SOME OF THE CUTEST ANIMALS OF THE PARK 
ARE THESE BLACK AND WHITE LEMURS BUT HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM 
WE'VE ASSEMBLED A GROUP OF ANIMAL ANTICS ARMED WITH QUESTIONS 
AND LOOKING FOR ANSWERS FROM KEEPER RUTH 
WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST 
ISABELLA DO THEY HAVE A PARTNER 
FOR LIFE NO THEY'RE QUITE SOCIABLE BUT THEY LIVE IN FAMILY GROUPS 
THEY DON'T MATE FOR LIFE WHO ELSE 
WHY ARE THEY BLACK AND WHITE BECAUSE OF CAMOUFLAGE 
ON THE GRASS THEY STICK OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB 
BUT UP IN THE TREES THEIR BLACK AND WHITE BOLD PATTERNS 
BREAK UP THE SILHOUETTE OF THE LEMURS 
WHICH IS WHAT PREDATORS WOULD BE LOOKING FOR 
ARE THEY DANGEROUS NO THEY'RE NOT DANGEROUS REALLY 
LEMURS ARE QUITE DOCILE AS A SPECIES BUT I IMAGINE THEY COULD GIVE YOU 
A NASTY BITE IF THEY WANTED TO 
IS THERE A DOMINANT FEMALE OR MALE IN THE GROUP 
IN LEMUR SOCIETY THE FEMALES ARE DOMINANT DUE TO THEM BEING BIGGER 
AND STRONGER AND MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN THE MALES 
WHO IS THE DOMINANT ONE HERE GRUNGE IS OUR DOMINANT FEMALE 
NOT A VERY NICE NAME FOR A LADY 
THAT MIGHT BE HER BEHIND YOU 
DO YOU THINK SHE IS KEEPING AN EYE ON US COS SHE IS THE DOMINANT ONE 
YES SHE COULD BE 
CHARLOTTE WHY DON'T YOU ASK ONE 
DO THEY BUILT NESTS THEY DO THE FEMALES WILL GATHER 
NEST MATERIALS SUCH AS TWIGS AND LEAVES AND USE THAT FOR BEDDING 
IN THE WILD THEIR NEST WOULD GENERALLY BE A HOLLOW TREE 
BUT IN CAPTIVITY WE RECREATE THIS USING WOODEN NEST BOXES 
WHERE THE FEMALES GO OFF AND FORAGE FOR FOOD 
AND LEAVE THE YOUNG IN THEIR NESTS AS THE YOUNG GET BRAVER 
THEY'LL GRADUALLY VENTURE OUT OF THEIR NEST BOX 
RUTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SOME BRILLIANT ANSWERS TO OUR QUESTIONS 
GANG HAVE YOU LEARNED A LOT ABOUT BLACK AND WHITE LEMURS 
YES WE'LL BE BACK NEXT TIME WITH SOME MORE ASK THE KEEPER 
THE KEEPERS HERE 
ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE LIFE MORE INTERESTING FOR THE ANIMALS 
NOW I AM BACK WITH KEEPER CHRIS HALES WHO'S TRYING TO TURN TIGER MEAL TIMES 
INTO A CHALLENGE 
EARLY ON YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU THINK INGRID WILL GET THE FOOD FIRST 
DEFINITELY I AM GOING TO HAVE TO GO WITH TUG THEN 
COS I FEEL A BIT SORRY FOR HIM 
YOU'RE GONNA LET THE BIG CATS OUT AND AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE HOW THEY DO 
BRILLIANT I'LL LEAVE YOU TO DO THAT BIT THOUGH 
COME ON GUYS TUG INGRID COME ON 
HERE THEY COME 
COME ON YOU ARE YOU READY 
ARE YOU READY 
MAKE IT FAIR INGRID IS STRAIGHT OUT NOT A PROBLEM OFF SHE IS GOING 
CHRIS DO OH LOOK AT TUG 
I'M IMPRESSED 
LET'S SEE THAT AGAIN 
HE HAS JUST CRAWLED UP TO THAT 
THEY HAVE TO JUMP DOWN DON'T THEY 
THEY DO THERE IS DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THEY CAN GET DOWN 
BECAUSE TIGERS AREN'T NATURAL CLIMBERS 
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO COME BACK DOWN 
THEY ARE NOT USED TO BEING UP AT A HEIGHT 
IT LOOKS SO WRONG TO SEE A TIGER UP A TREE 
IS SHE STUCK THAT IS AWESOME SHE'S JUST TRYING TO GET THE FOOD DOWN 
SHE WILL PROBABLY START EATING IT 
IS THAT SOMETHING THEY WOULD NORMALLY DO NOT AT ALL 
NORMALLY SHE WILL RUN STRAIGHT UP THE TREE GRAB IT JUMP DOWN 
BUT WE OBVIOUSLY PUT IT UP THERE TOO WELL 
AND SHE IS HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM 
HERE SHE GOES 
SHE JUMPED OFF OCCASIONALLY WE PUT THE FOOD UP HIGHER 
AND THAT IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET DOWN 
THEY DON'T WANT TO JUMP OFF FROM THAT KIND OF HEIGHT 
IT IS HARD FOR THEM TO COME DOWN 
COS THEIR CLAWS ARE HOOKING DOWNWARDS LIKE THIS 
AND SO IN ORDER FOR THEM TO GET DOWN 
THEY HAVE TO LIFT THEIR FOOT OFF OR RETRACT THEIR CLAWS 
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT COS THEY ARE GOING TO FALL 
THEY ARE VERY CLUMSY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMBING BACK DOWN AGAIN 
WHAT ELSE WOULD THEY USE THEIR CLAWS FOR 
THEY ARE ACTUALLY THEIR MOST IMPORTANT TOOL THAT THEY OWN 
THEY USE THEM FOR GETTING HOLD 
OF THEIR PREY AND THEY CAN CLING ON COS THEY ARE RAZOR SHARP 
THEIR CLAWS CAN GET TO TWO OR THREE INCHES LONG 
AND THEY HAVE THESE TREES IN HERE THAT THEY WILL GO UP TO 
SCRATCH THEIR CLAWS ON TO MAKE THEM SHARP 
SO THIS ENRICHMENT TEST IS GOOD AS WELL TO KEEP THEIR CLAWS SHARP YES 
BRILLIANT THEY LOOK VERY HAPPY THEY HAVE GOT THEIR MEAT 
AND I AM REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE GOT THERE FIRST THANKS VERY MUCH 
EARLY IN THE SHOW YOU SAW ME AND STUART COLLECTING THIS DELIGHTFUL 
BUCKET OF POO FROM THE TAPIER ENCLOSURE 
NOW WE ARE INSIDE ONE OF THE BLACK RHINO ENCLOSURES AND WE ARE ABOUT 
TO BEGIN OUR ENRICHMENT TEST 
THE IDEA IS TO SEE HOW THESE RHINOS WILL REACT 
TO ANOTHER ANIMALS' DROPPINGS IN THE TERRITORY 
FIRST WE HAVE GOT TO GET RID OF ALL THIS POO 
THAT IS THERE LET'S GET DIGGING 
THEY HAVE GOT THREE BLACK RHINO IN THIS AREA 
THREE BLACK RHINO IN THE COLLECTION HERE 
WILL WE JUST LET THEM ALL OUT 
NO WHAT WE WILL DO IS LET ONE OUT 
BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GAUGE WHAT THEIR REACTION IS GOING TO BE 
BLACK RHINOS ARE SOLITARY IN THE WILD 
THEY ARE HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE ANIMALS BECAUSE OF THAT 
THEY HAVE A REALLY ACUTE SENSE OF SMELL AND HEARING 
BUT VERY POOR EYESIGHT THEIR SENSE OF SMELL 
AND THAT HEARING ACTUALLY HELPS THEM SURVIVE OUT IN THE WILD 
IF WE LET ALL THREE THROUGH AND THIS TAPIER POO 
HAS A NEGATIVE TYPE REACTION THAT PRODUCES AGGRESSION 
WE HAVE THREE RHINOS IN ONE PLACE AT ONE TIME 
ONE AT A TIME IS A GOOD IDEA 
THEY ARE DANGEROUS CREATURES WHEN THEY ARE ANGRY 
SHALL I JUST SPREAD IT OUT SPREAD IT THERE 
DELIGHTFUL RUN THAT OVER SO THEY CAN GET THE AROMA 
IF I TAKE OUT THE BUCKET AND A WHEELBARROW 
WILL YOU GO AND DO THE HONOURS AND LET ONE OF THE RHINOS THROUGH 
NO WORRIES GREAT STUFF I WILL SEE YOU BACK IN A BIT 
THE SMELLS GOOD 
HERE SHE COMES FINGERS CROSSED FOR A GOOD REACTION 
HEY SHE JUST CAME STRAIGHT OVER 
SHE IS DEFINITELY POSSIBLY INTERESTED IN WHAT IS GOING ON HERE 
WHO HAVE WE GOT HERE THIS IS MAFENGE 
SHE IS ONE OF OUR FEMALE RHINOS 
IF ANYTHING SHE IS PROBABLY THE MOST REACTIVE 
SHE IS QUITE A BOLSHIE CHARACTER 
SHE WILL TAKE A LOT OF INTEREST IN WHAT IS GOING ON HERE 
SHE'S HAVING A GOOD SNIFF YES 
SNORTING A LITTLE BIT THERE 
IS THAT JUST SCENTING OR IS THIS SOME SORT OF REACTION DO YOU THINK 
SHE'S JUST GENERALLY TAKING HER TIME 
IT IS A COMPLETELY FOREIGN SMELL TO HER 
AND SHE IS TAKING HER TIME BEING PATIENT 
AND SHE IS REALLY ASSESSING WHAT IS GOING ON 
SHE HAS JUST TURNED AROUND AND TROD RIGHT IN THE POO 
DO YOU THINK SHE HAS DONE THAT ON PURPOSE COULD POSSIBLY BE 
SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE WANTS TO ACTUALLY LAY HER MARKER DOWN 
AS WE WERE TALKING SHE IS GOING TO DO A POO RIGHT ON TOP OF IT 
YOU CAN SMELL THAT IS QUITE TOUGH 
THAT IS GROSS LET'S SEE IT AGAIN 
SHE IS DOING EVERYTHING THAT I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT DO 
THAT SMELL IS NOW GOING TO BE RELEASED ACROSS THE AREA 
IN THE WILD THEIR SENSE OF SMELL 
IS THAT ACUTE THAT ANY RHINOS WITHIN HER TERRITORY WILL BE ABLE TO SMELL 
THAT RIGHT NOW AND WILL WANT TO COME AND INVESTIGATE IT 
IT IS AMAZING TO SEE HER BEHAVING THIS WAY 
DO YOU THINK IT HAS BEEN A SUCCESS 
YES IT HAS BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS SHE HAS DONE SOMETHING 
TO STIMULATE HER NATURAL BEHAVIOUR 
MAYBE WE CAN TRY A FEW MORE DIFFERENT SMELLS 
MAYBE SOMETHING FROM HER OWN CONTINENT 
LIKE THE AFRICAN ELEPHANTS OR EVEN A PREDATOR SMELL 
WE WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW IT GOES 
WILL YOU LET US KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HER AGAIN 
FOR NOW SHALL WE MOVE OFF IT IS A LITTLE BIT WIFFY ROUND HERE 
NOW CONTINUING WITH THE POO THEME THEME WE HAVE ASKED THE KEEPERS 
WHO THEY THINK IS THE SMELLIEST ANIMAL IN THE PARK 
DEFINITELY LOUIS THE GIANT ANTEATER 
THE SMELLIEST ANIMAL HAS TO BE THE MONKEYS 
PROBABLY THE GORILLA BECAUSE HE HAS LOTS OF SMELLY POOS SOMETIMES 
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF LOVE 
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE GORILLAS THE REASON FOR THAT IS EVERY TIME 
I SEEM TO BE CLEARING OUT I GET LOTS OF POO ON THE END OF MY BOOTS 
OCELOTS OCELOTS I WOULD SAY THE OCELOT 
THE SMELLIEST ANIMAL HAS TO BE THE OCELOT MALE IN PARTICULAR 
WHEN THEY URINATE ON METAL IT ACTUALLY LIQUIDATES IT 
THE ELEPHANTS THE ELEPHANTS THE ELEPHANTS 
SMELLIEST ANIMAL IN THE PARK HAS GOT TO BE THE RHINOS 
THEY POO A LOT AND IN THE SUMMER IT REALLY MAKES IT SMELL 
I THINK THE SMELLIEST ANIMAL IN THE PARK IS THE TAPIERS ARE YOU SURE 
THE SMELLIEST ANIMAL I SAY IS THE JAVAN LANGURS COS THEY BURP A LOT 
THE LANGURS WHEN THEY BURP IN YOUR FACE 
THE SMELLIEST ANIMAL I WOULD SAY WOULD HAVE TO BE AN OCELOT 
THE OCELOTS APART FROM MYSELF I'D HAVE TO SAY THE OCELOTS 
THE OCELOT SHED'S PRETTY MUCH A BOG OF ETERNAL STENCH 
IF YOU PUT YOUR HAND IN ANY OF THEIR MESS 
YOU WON'T GET IT OFF IN ABOUT TWENTY WASHES 
SO THE CLEAR WINNER WITH THE MOST SMELLY VOTES IS THE OCELOT 
IT'S DINNER TIME HERE FOR THE TWELVE ELEPHANTS 
SO WE'VE COME DOWN TO GIVE LIZ MORRIS AND HER TEAM A HELPING HAND 
ALL RIGHT LIZ IT'S A NOISY JOB AS YOU CAN HERE BUT WE NEED THIS 
DUMPER TRUCK TO SHIFT THIS AMOUNT OF FOOD 
HOW LONG WILL THIS LAST THEM THROUGH THE NIGHT 
THIS IS THEIR LAST FEED OF THE DAY 
WHEREAS WE DO LIKE TO FEED THEM 
THREE TIMES A DAY SO THEY'RE FEEDING ALL THE TIME 
LIKE IN THE WILD 
IS THIS THE SAME FOOD YOU WOULD FEED THEM AT EVERY MEAL 
NO THEY GET FRUIT AND VEG IN THE MORNING 
THEN HAY NOW AND MAYBE SOME TREATS THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
IT IS HARD WORK THIS ISN'T IT I'LL JUST THROW THIS IN 
THERE IS ALWAYS CERTAIN ELEPHANTS THAT WILL FEED FIRST 
THERE IS A HIERARCHY WITHIN THE ELEPHANTS 
OBVIOUSLY YOU GET THE BOSS THE MATRIARCH WHICH IS MASSA 
WHO GOT HER FOOD FIRST OVER THERE 
SHE GETS THE FOOD FIRST AND THEN YOU GO DOWN THE HIERARCHY 
WHAT ABOUT THE LITTLE CALVES WHEN WILL THEY GET TO EAT 
THEY BASICALLY EAT WITH THEM MUM SO WHENEVER MUM NEEDS THEY EAT 
I'LL CHUCK THIS ONE HERE 
AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US 
WE'LL FINISH UP THIS JOB 
IT'S THE END OF THE SHOW CHECK OUT WHAT'S COMING UP ON THE NEXT ROAR 
I'LL GET THE NEXT BATCH 
A WILD DOG PUPPY IS DANGEROUSLY ILL 
WILL A KILLER BUG SPREAD TO THE ENTIRE PACK 
WE FIND OUT HOW YOU MEASURE A GIRAFFE 
AND THE ELEPHANTS CAN'T GO OUT TO LUNCH 
COS THEY'VE LOCKED THEMSELVES IN A PADDOCK 
YOU MIGHT BE HUNGRY BUT I CAN'T OPEN IT
