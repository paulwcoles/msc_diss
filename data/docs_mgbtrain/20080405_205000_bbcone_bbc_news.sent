HELLO GOOD EVENING TO YOU THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH HAS ARRIVED IN 
BRITAIN TONIGHT ON THE LATEST LEG 
OF ITS JOURNEY ACROSS THE WORLD 
SCORES OF ATHLETES AND CELEBRITIES 
WILL TAKE TURNS TO CARRY IT ACROSS 
LONDON TOMORROW TO DOWNING STREET 
WHERE IT WILL BE WELCOMED BY GORDON 
BROWN BUT DEMONSTRATORS ARE 
PROMISE TO STAGE PROTESTS ALONG THE 
ROUTE ANGRY AT CHINA'S HUMAN 
RIGHTS RECORD AND THE RECENT CRACK 
DOWN IN TIBET 
THE RED CARPET WAS READY AND 
WAITING AS THE OLYMPIC FLAME WAS 
HELD ALOFT A SMILING OFFICIAL FROM 
THE BEIJING OLYMPIC OLYMPIC CARRIED 
IT ONTO BRITISH SOIL FOR THE 
OFFICIAL GREETING BY THE CHINESE 
AMBASSADOR HER EMBASSY HAS DENIED 
REPORTS SHE'S PULLING OUT OF THE 
RELAY TAKING THE TORCH THROUGH 
LONDON TOMORROW THE FLAME WILL BE 
THE FOCUS OF PROTESTS AGAINST 
CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD THE 
LIMB OLYMPICS MINISTER DEFENDED 
THE DECISION TO RECEIVE IT IN 
DOWNING STREET 
MEETING THE TORCH 
IS NOT IN ANY WAY CONDONING THE 
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE ASPECTS OF 
THE HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME THE DENIAL 
OF DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOMS IN 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE CLEAR 
ABOUT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER AND 
ANYBODY ELSE ENGAGED IN THIS 
RAILSED THESE ISSUES OF CONCERN AT 
EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY BUT BUT GORDON BROWN IS UNDER FURTHER 
PRESSURE NOT TO RECEIVE THE FLAME 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER NICK 
CLEGG SAID IT WAS WHOLLY 
INAPPROPRIATE AT A CONFERENCE OF 
WORLD LEADERS MR. BROWN SAID HE 
WOULD NOT BACK DOWN 
THE DALAI LAMA 
HIMSELF SAYS HE DOES NOT WANT TO 
SEE A BOYCOTT OF THE OLYMPICS 
THAT'S WHY I HAVE SAID AS THE HOST 
COUNTRY FOR THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS THAT 
I WILL ATTEND THE OLYMPICS AS I 
KNOW MANY OTHERS WILL DO GORDON GORDON BROWN BELIEVES THE INTERNATIONAL 
FOCUS WHICH COMES WITH THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ANY 
BOYCOTT IN BUTTING PRESSURE ON 
CHINA OVER HUMAN RITES CAMPAIGNERS 
ARE DISMAYED OVER HIS DECISION HE HE CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE RECEIVING 
THE TORCH THE TORCH IS ABOUT SPORT 
IT'S FINE FOR CELEBRITIES AND 
SPORTS PEOPLE TO CARRY THE TORCH 
WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT HE IS 
ASSOCIATING HIMSELF WITH A TORCH 
WHICH IS TAINTED BY CHINA TRYING TO 
USE IT AS A PROPAGANDA TOOL 
ACTIVISTS PROTESTING AT CHINA'S 
SUPPRESSION OF TIBET'S INDEPENDENCE 
MOVEMENT UNFURLED BANNER TODAY 
A FORETASTE OF THE PROTESTS PLANNED 
TOMORROW A STAR STUDED CAST IS DUE 
TO CARRY THE FLIM ACROSS THE 
CAPITAL THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S DUE 
TO HOST THE NEXT OLYMPICS WANTS TO 
SHOW IT CAN MANAGE PEACEFUL PROTEST 
AND ENSURE THE EVENT IS SUCCESS 
OUR CORRESPONDENT JAMES PEARCE IS 
AT HEATHROW WHERE THE OLYMPIC 
FLAME ARRIVED EARLIER TONIGHT 
JAMES WHAT CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE 
TOMORROW 
WELL YOU WILL SEE IN TOMORROW THEORY A NUMBER OF FAMOUS PEOPLE 
CARRYING THE OLYMPIC FLAME UNDER 
NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THIS IS THE 
CHANCE THAT MAN QUI PEOPLE IN 
BRITAIN HAVE NEVER HAD BEFORE THE 
CHANCE TO SEE THE OLYMPIC FLAME IN 
THEIR OWN COUNTRY UNDER NORMAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD BE A 
FANTASTIC DAY OUT THESE AREN'T 
NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THE ISSUE 
OF TIBET NOW DOGING THE WHOLE OF 
THE TORCH RELAY IT'S HARD TO 
PREDICT HOW LARGE DEMONSTRATIONS 
WILL BE WE KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER 
OF PLANNED DEMONSTRATIONS KAERL 
WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CHINESE 
AMBASSADOR WHO WAS HERE TONIGHT TO 
WELCOME THE OFFICIAL PARTY WITH THE 
TORCH STILL NO CONFIRMATION 
WHETHER OR NOT SHE WILL RUN SHE'S 
DUE TO RUN ABOUT MID DAY OUTSIDE 
THE BRITISH MUSEUM IF SHE TAKES 
PART OF COURSE THAT'S BAND TO BE 
THE FOCUS FOR SOME OF THE 
DEMONSTRATORS APART FROM THAT YOU 
SECURITY IS ALREADY TIGHT I'M 
OUTSIDE THE ROYAL SUITE AT HEATHROW 
THE PLANE WAS INITIALLY DUE TO COME 
TO TERMINAL FIVE IT WAS MOVED FOR 
SECURITY REASONS TODAY IT WAS KEPT 
SECURE TOMORROW WILL BE A TOUGHER 
JOB FOR THE POLICE 
THANKS VERY 
MUCH MUCH ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION LEADER HAS 
SAID HE FEARS THAT PRESIDENT ROBERT 
MUGABE IS PREPARING FOR WAR AGAINST 
HIS PEOPLE IN AN ATTEMPT TO CLING 
TO POWER IT'S ONE WEEK TO THE DAY 
SINCE THE ELECTION THERE ARE STILL 
NO RESULTS FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL 
VOTE TODAY THE M. D. C. LEADER MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI INSISTED THAT HE WAS 
THE CLEAR WINNER AND GETTING READY 
FOR POWER THE B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM 
ZIMBABWE BUT ORLA GUERIN SENT THIS 
REPORT FROM SOUTH AFRICA 
ZIMBABWE REMAINS CALM BUT IS THIS 
A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME FOR DAYS 
RIOT POLICE HAVE BEEN ON THE 
STREETS SO FAR IN SMALL NUMBERS 
BUT THE OPPOSITION CLAIMS THERE'S A 
CRACK DOWN ON THE WAY IT SAYS THE 
REGIME IS PREPARING FOR WAR AGAINST 
THE PEOPLE 
YOU KNOW THAT THOUSANDS 
OF ARMY RECRUITS ARE BEING 
RECRUITED MILITANTS ARE BEING 
REHABILITATED AND SOME FEW ARE 
ALREADY ON THE WAR PATH AFRICAN 
LEADERS SURELY MUST NOW SAY NO TO 
MUGABE 
THAT MESSAGE ECHOED BY MUGABE OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS IN LONDON 
THEY GATHERED OUTSIDE THE 
ZIMBABWEAN EMBASSY CALLING ON THE 
WORLD TO ACT QUICKLY ONE POTENTIAL 
POWER BROKER IS IN NO HURRY THAT'S 
ROBERT MUGABE'S NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR 
THABO MBEKI LOOKING RELAXED ON 
BRITISH SOIL SOUTH AFRICA'S 
PRESIDENT WANTS THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY TO BE PATIENT GORDON 
BROWN WANTS NO MORE DELAYS WE'LL WE'LL SEE WHAT RESULTS COME OUT AS I SAY 
TSVANGIRAI AND MUGABE HAVE SAID IN 
THE EVENT THAT NOBODY HAS GOT THIS 
MAJORITY THAT'S NEEDED TO BE 
ELECTED THEY'RE QUITE READY FOR A 
SECOND ROUND 
THE IMPORTANT THING 
IS THAT THE RESULTS HAVE GOT TO BE 
PUBLISHED THEY CANNOT BE ANY 
LONGER DELAYED THE ELECTIONS HAVE 
GOT TO BE SEEN TO BE FAIR THAT'S 
THE UNITED VIEW OF EVERYBODY HERE 
ROBERT MUGABE IS MORE CONCERNED 
WITH HIS INNER CIRCLE THAN THE 
OUTSIDE WORLD HE'S HAD CAREFULLY 
CHOREOGRAPHED SHOW OF SUPPORT BY 
THE POLITBURO OF THE RULING PARTY 
PUBLICLY THEY'RE BACKING HIM ALL 
THE WAY IN THE A PRESIDENTIAL RUN 
OFF IF THERE IS ANOTHER VOTE HE 
WON'T WANT TO LEAVE MUCH TO CHANCE 
THAT'S WHERE THE SECURITY FORCES 
COME IN BUT CAN HE REALLY COUNT ON 
THE GENERALS AND DOES HE HAVE THE 
RANK AND FILE THAT COULD BE HIS 
NEXT BIG TEST 
THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH IS TO SPEND 
THIRD NIGHT IN HOSPITAL WHERE HE'S 
BEING TREATED FOR A CHEST INFECTION 
WELL WISHERS INCLUDING THE ACTRESS 
JOANNA LUMLEY DELIVERED FLOWERS 
TODAY PRINCE PHILIPUALS ADMITTED 
TO KING EDWARD THE SEVENTH HOSPITAL TWO 
DAYS AGO 
TWO WOMEN WHO WERE ARRESTED IN 
CONNECTION WITH THE ALLEGED 
ABDUCTION OF SHANNON MATTHEWS HAVE 
BEEN RELEASED ON BAIL THE WOMEN 
WHO ARE THE MOTHER AND SISTER OF 
SHANNON'S STEPFATHER CRAIG MEEHAN 
HAD BEEN QUESTIONED ON SUSPICION OF 
ASSISTING AN OFFENDER AND ATTEMPT 
TO PERVERT THE COURSE OF JUSTICE 
MR. MEEHAN'S UNCLE MICHAEL DONOVAN 
HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH KIDNAPPING 
SHANNON WHO WAS FOUND LAST MONTH 
AFTER BEING MISSING FOR MORE THAN 
THREE WEEKS 
PASSENGERS HAVE AGAIN FACED 
DISRUPTION AT HEATHROW'S TERMINAL FIVE 
AFTER PROBLEMS DEVELOPED WITH THE 
BAGGAGE SYSTEM TWELVE FLIGHTS WERE 
CANCELLED AND THERE WERE MORE LONG 
DELAYS BRITISH AIRWAYS HAD SAID 
THAT THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST DAY OF 
NORMAL OPERATIONS AT THE TERMINAL 
BUT INSTEAD THERE'S BEEN MORE 
MISERY FOR PASSENGERS 
IT WAS ALL MEANT TO HAVE BEEN 
SMOOTH FLYING FROM HERE IN AFTER 
THE SHAMBOLIC OPENING MORE THAN A 
WEEK AGO TODAY B. A. WAS HOPING 
TERMINAL FIVE WOULD RETURN TO NORMAL 
OPERATIONS FOR PASSENGERS LIKE 
THIS FAMILY WHO HAD BEEN HOPE TO 
GET TO PARIS THIS AFTERNOON THEIR 
FLIGHT WAS CANCELLED 
THIS WASTING 
OF TIME FOR THE KIDS IT'S TIRING 
WE WILL BE THERE NIGHTTIME IT'S A 
BIT TIRING AS WELL 
BRITISH AIRWAYS 
HAD HOPED TO RESUME A FULL FLYING 
SCHEDULE TODAY BUT A COMPUTER 
SOFTWARE GLITCH IN THE BAGGAGE 
SYSTEM HAS CAUSED MORE MISERY FOR 
PASSENGERS THE OPERATORS B. A. A. HAS 
APOLOGISED AND TAKEN FULL 
RESPONSIBILITY BUT WHAT IS THE 
REAL PRICE OF THE LAST NINE DAYS TO 
B. A. FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE FLIGHTS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED 
AN ESTIMATED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PASSENGERS 
DISRUPTED AND A COST TO THE AIRLINE 
OF AROUND SIXTEEN MILLION CAN B. A. 
RECOVER ITS REPUTATION 
A LOT OF 
WORK WILL HAVE TO BE UNDERTAKEN L. 
THINK THE FACILITY WILL IN THE 
COURSE OF TIME SETTLE DOWN THE 
QUESTION IS HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO 
TAKE AND HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE AS 
WELL TO RESTORE THE CONFIDENCE TO 
THE PUBLIC AND ENSURE BRITISH 
AIRWAYS DOESN'T LOSE FUTURE 
BUSINESS 
LAST WEEK THESE IMAGES BUSINESS WERE GIVEN TO THE B. B. C. BY AN AIRPORT 
SOURCE IT'S THOUGHT AS MANY AS 
TWENTY THOUSAND BAGS HAD PILED UP B. A. A. SAYS 
IT'S WORKING TO MINIMISE DISRUPTION 
CAUSED BY THE COMPUTER SOFTWARE IT 
MEANS LUGGAGE IS BEING MOVED BY 
HAND SINCE TERMINAL FIVE OPENED B. A. 
SAYS TEN THOUSAND BAGS ARE STILL BEING 
PROCESSED THE NEXT BIG MOMENT FOR 
TERMINAL FIVE IS WHEN LONG HAUL 
FLIGHTS ARE BROUGHT IN AT THE END 
OF THE MONTH BRITISH AIRWAYS WILL 
BE HOPING WHAT IT CALLED ITS 
TEETHING PROBLEMS WILL BE A 
MEMORY MEMORY NOW THE HUGELY BUSY DAY OF SPORT 
AND ALL THE FOOTBALL RESULTS 
HERE'S CELINA HINCHCLIFFE

BEFORE THE RACE LATE ON IN THE 
BETTING A JOINT FAVOURITE EMERGED
