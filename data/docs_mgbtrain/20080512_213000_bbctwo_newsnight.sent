JIMMY MIZEN JUST SIXTEEN ANOTHER YOUNG 
MAN MURDERED HOW DO WE STOP 
TEENAGERS KILLING OTHER TEENAGERS TONIGHT TONIGHT A GENTLE AND COMPASSIONATE BOY 
THAT IS HOW THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS 
DESCRIBE JIMMY MIZEN THE LATEST 
VICTIM OF MINDLESS VIOLENCE 
TONIGHT WE DEVOTE MUCH OF THE 
PROGRAMME TO EXPLORING WHY 
TEENAGERS KILL TEENAGERS WITH THE 
FATHER OF DAMILOLA TAYLOR THE NEW 
DEPUTY MAYOR OF LONDON AND THE 
COMMENTATOR MELANIE PHILLIPS 
THOUSANDS DIE IN A HUGE EARTHQUAKE 
IN SOUTH EAST CHINA WE ARE HEARING 
ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE CALAMITY 
ALSO ALSO ANY CHANCE OF HAVING A WORD ON 
CAMERA 
FOR WHAT 
ABOUT THE BOOK CAMERA FOR NEWSNIGHT 
WHY NOT 
WHEN MICHAEL MET MICHAEL 
WHY ARE THERE SO FEW FANS OF GORDON 
BROWN AND LURID HEADLINES SCREAM 
INFLATION BUT WHAT IS THE TRUE 
STORY ABOUT PRICE RISES 
GOOD EVENING JIMMY MIZEN'S 
KILLER MUST HAVE THOUGHT THAT LIFE 
WAS CHEAP WHEN HE TOOK IT AWAY SO 
CASUALLALLY ON SATURDAY MORNING IN 
SOUTH EAST LONDON THE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD 
WHO REFUSED HIS ATTACKER'S 
CHALLENGE TOIFIED DIED WHEN A 
PIECE OF GLASS PIERCED HIS NECK 
TODAY AT A SERVICE OF REMEMBRANCE 
HIS MOTHER MARGARET OFFERED 
SYMPATHY TO THE PARENTS'S OF THE 
SON'S KILLERS 
HE IS THE THIRTEENTH TEENAGER TO BE 
MURDERED THIS YEAR 
HERE IS TIM WHEWELL 
AS THE YEAR HAS GONE ON THE TOLL 
OF TEENAGE LIVES HAS GROWN HEAVIER 
AND HEAVIER IN LONDON THIRTEEN 
YOUNGSTERS HAVE MET A VIOLENCE 
DEATH MOST OF IT AT THE HANDS OF 
OTHER TEENAGERS NATIONALLY THERE 
ARE NO STATISTICS AVAILABLE THE 
NUMBER OF TEENAGERS TO HAVE BEEN 
KILLED IS THOUGHT TO HAVE GROWN 
JIMMY MIZEN DIED ON SATURDAY THE 
DAY AFTER HIS SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY ALL 
WEEKEND FAMILY AND FRIENDS HAVE 
BEEN LEAVING TRIBUTES TO HIM 
REMEMBERING THE SIX F. T. FOUR THEY 
DESCRIBED AS THE ENTLE GIANT 
JIMMY WAS THIS HAS BEEN ANOTHER 
SIDE THAT WAS NOT EVEN SHARED TO US 
THAT WE DID NOT APPRECIATE IT WAS 
UNDER OUR NOSES HE WAS DEAR 
DEAR SWEET MAN WE LOVED HIM DEARLY 
ON THE NIGHT OF HIS BIRTHDAY WE 
CUDDLED HIM NOTHING UNUSUAL WE 
SAID WE LOVED HIM IT IS A GREAT 
MEMORY FOR ME AND MARGARET 
HE WAS KILLED AT THIS BAKERY NEAR 
HIS HOME IT IS BELIEVED HE WALKED 
IN HERE BEFORE MIDDAY WHEN HE SAW 
A MAN ARGUING WITH HIS ELDER 
BROTHER HARRY POLICE SAY THAT 
JIMMY TRIED TO CALM THE SITUATION 
THE ATTACKER LEFT BUT CAME IN 
SMASHING DOWN THE DOORD AND 
BRANDISHING AN ADVERTISING BOARD HE 
FOUND INSIDE JIMMY DIED IN HIS 
BROTHER'S ARMS FATALLY INJURED BY 
THE GLASS EMBEDDED IN HIS NECK 
WHAT HAPPENED TO JIMMY LOOKS 
DIFFERENT TO THE VIOLENCE DEATHS OF 
TEENAGERS THIS YEAR NOT A STABBING 
STABBING A SHOOTING NOR A 
THROINK GANGS YET FOR MANY IT IS 
PART OF A TREND OF INCREASING ANGER 
AND VIOLENCE IN YOUNG PEOPLE 
JIMMY'S PARENTS REFUSE TO SHOW 
BITTERNESS BUT TALK OF HOW SOCIETY 
MUST CHANGE 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHY ARE YOU NOT 
ANGRY IF I AM ANGRY I AM DOING 
THE SAME AS THIS YOUNG CHAP WE 
HAVE TO GET RID OF THE ANGER WE 
HAVE GOT TO 
THE HOME OFFICE SAYS THAT THERE IS 
NO EVIDENCE THAT VIOLENT CRIME BY 
YOUNG PEOPLE IS ON THE INCREASE 
BUT THE NUMBER OF MURDERS BY YOUNG 
TEENAGERS ROSE DRAMATICALLY BEFORE 
REMAINING CONSTANT BEFORE THAT THE 
POLICE SAY THAT THIS IS THE SECOND 
MOST SERIOUS ISSUE AFTER TERRORISM 
SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE IT IS A 
NATIONAL PATTERN 
IT IS BECOMING MUCH MORE WIDESPREAD 
THAN IT USED TO BE WE HAD 
SITUATION WHERE MOST MURDERS WERE 
COMMITTED BY PEOPLE WHEN HAD LONG 
CRIMINAL HISTORY BEHIND THEM IF 
NOT MIDDLE AGED GANGSTERS KILLING 
MIDDLE AGED GANGSTERS THEN 
HARDENED PROFESSIONALS KILLING 
HARDENED PROFESSIONALS WHAT HAS 
CHANGED IS THERE HAVE BEEN NUMBER 
OF AMATEUR MURDERS 
THE MURDER OF 
STEPHEN LAWRENCE A FEW MILES FROM 
WHERE JIMMY WAS KILLED CAUSED 
NATIONAL OUTRAGE BUT STEPHEN'S 
FRIEND D. W. A. Y. N. E. BROOKS BELIEVES 
THAT THIS IS WORSE 
BEFORE IT WAS FISTICUFFS NOW IT IS 
ABOUT CARRYING NIES FOR PROTECTION 
ABOUT BEING HARD ABOUT BEING BAD 
ABOUT BEING IN A GANG SHOWING TO 
THE WOMEN YOU ARE TOUGH MIGHTY 
YOU CARRY ALL THE STUFF THAT COMES 
ALONG WITH THAT 
ACROSS SOUTH LONDON IN PECKHAM 
WHERE ANOTHER TEENAGER WAS KILLED 
EARLIER IN THE MONTH YOUNGSTERS 
WERE DEBATING ITS CAUSES TODAY AT A 
COMMUNITY RADIO STATION 
IT IS ABOUT BEING THE BIGGER MAN 
YOU WILL BE WALKING DOWN THE STREET 
YOU SEE ANOTHER GROUP OF BOYS 
LOOKING A. R. STARING AT YOU THEY 
COULD PROBABLY HOLD SOMETHING IN 
THEIR POCKET OR TRY TO WALK AWAY 
TRY TO AVOID THEM ENCOURAGING ENCOURAGING YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED IN 
BROADCASTING IN RADIO PECKHAM IS A 
WAY OF KEEPING THEM OFF THE STREETS 
BUT THEY SEE NO EASY ANSWER TO THE 
PROBLEM OF KNIFE CRIME 
THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THE PERCEPTION 
OF VIOLENCE IN INNER CITY 
COMMUNITIES LOTS OF PEOPLE YOUNG 
PEOPLE ESPECIALLY ARE WORRIED 
THAT OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
CARRYING WEAPONS SO THEREFORE 
SOME OF THEM RRY WEAPONS THEMSELVES 
THE CHILDREN NOT THEMSELVES INVOLVED IN GANGS OR KNIFE CRIME 
ARE LEFT OUT AS OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE 
IS TRYING TO STOP KNIFE CRIME SO 
PEOPLE THAT ARE IN GANGS GET A LOT 
OF ATTENTION AND AND SUPPORT AND 
MONEY FROM THE GOVERNMENT THIS THIS WEEKEND'S TRAJZI DID NOT INVOLVE 
GUNS OR KNIVES BUT IT IS THOSE 
WEAPONS THAT WORRY THE POLICE THE 
MOST THE NUMBER OF STABBINGS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES HAS REMAINED 
CONSTANT BUT THE NUMBER OF 
SHOOTINGS IN THE SAME AGE GROUP HAS 
RISEN EIGHTEEN PER CENT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY 
THE REASON IT 
IS HAPPENING IS THAT THERE IS A 
GREATER SUPPLY OF WEAPONS 
THEY ARE COMING INTO THE COUNTRY 
IT IS RELATIVELY DIFFICULT TO SCAN 
FOR WEAPONS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY 
WITH THE BREAK UP OF YOU KNOW THE 
EASTERN BLOC A WHOLE NUMBER OF 
GUNS ARE FROM FORMER YUGOSLAVIA IT 
IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO SMUGGLE 
THEM INTO THE COUNTRY 
TONIGHT INTO THE INVESTIGATION OF 
THE RATHER DIFFERENT CASE OF JIMMY 
MIZEN'S DEATH THE POLICE SAID THEY 
WERE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS BUT 
PROGRESS INTO SOLVING THE ROOT 
CAUSES OF YOUTH VIOLENCE WILL BE 
SLOWER SLOWER TIM WHEWELL AND THE VIOLENCE OF 
BRITAIN'S STREETS HAS CONTINUED A 
MAN HAS BEEN MURDERED ON OXFORD 
STREET THE B. B. C.'S JANE FRANCIS 
KELLY IS THERE CAN YOU TELL US 
WHAT HAPPENED 
PART OF OXFORD 
STREET IS CORDONED OFF THE 
FORENSIC TEAMS ARE COLLECTING 
EVIDENCE THE POLICE TOLD ME THAT 
THE MAN WAS IN MCDONALD'S BEFORE 
FIVE P. M. HE CAME OUT WAS INVOLVED IN A 
SCUFFLE OR FIGHT THEN WAS STABBED 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE 
INVOLVED BUT NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN 
MADE THE MAN WAS IN HIS TWENTIES 
PARAMEDICS WERE ON THE SCENE IN 
FIVE MINUTES THEY TRIED TO SAVE 
HIM HE SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK OR 
CARDIAC ARREST AND WAS PRONOUNCED 
DEATH BY THE 
EMPHASISE THE DEATH THAT THIS CAUSE 
IT HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
AFTERNOON IN BROAD DAY LIGHT IN 
FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ON ONE 
OF BRITAIN'S PREMIERE SHOPPING 
STREETS STREETS THANK YOU 
I AM JOINED BY THE NEW DEPUTY MAYOR 
OF LONDON RAY LEWIS BY RICHARD 
TAYLOR THE FATHER OF DAMILOLA 
TAYLOR AND BY THE COMMENTATOR 
MELANIE PHILLIPS AND FROM 
MANCHESTER BY PATSY MCKIE FOR 
MOTHERS AGAINST VIOLENCE WHOSE SON 
WAS ALSO MURDERED 
RICHARD TAYLOR WHAT HAS IT COME TO 
THAT VIOLENCE IS VISITED SO 
CASUALLALLY BY TEENAGERS ON OTHER 
TEENAGERS 
IF I CAN JUST START BY TEENAGERS SAYING THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SOME 
OF THEM ARE VERY ANGRY ABOUT THE 
TREND THE SOCIETY WHAT THIS 
SOCIETY OR THE AUTHORITIES ARE FOR 
THEM THEM THERE HAS BEEN LOT OF THINGS 
HAPPENING IN WITHIN AND OUTSIDE 
THE SCHOOL AND IN THE FAMILY WHICH 
ENABLES YOUNG PEOPLE TO TAKE 
DECISIONS DECISIONS THIS HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF MOST OF 
THESE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE AROUND 
THE MAJORITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
EXCLUDED FROM SCHOOL SOME OF THEM 
HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO SECURED HOMES 
THE SECURED HOMES ARE NOT WELL 
MANAGED THE YOUNG PEOPLE GO OUT IN 
THE STREET AND BECOME PROBLEMS ON 
THE STREET 
PATSY CAN I ASK YOU THE SAME WHY 
DO YOU THINK VIOLENCE IS VISITED SO 
CASUALLALLY AND THE ESCALATION SO 
FAST 
FOR ME IT IS REALLY QUITE SAD FAST WHAT I AM HEARING IN REGARDS TO THE 
AMOUNT OF CRIME COMMITTED WITH 
YOUNG PEOPLE L. REALLY BELIEVE THAT 
WE HAVE TO ALL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING ON OUR 
COMMUNITIES NOT JUST LOOKING AT 
THE YOUNG PEOPLE BUT AS A 
COMMUNITY AS A NATION WE HAVE TO 
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT IS 
HAPPENING AMONG OUR YOUNG PEOPLE L. 
REALLY BELIEVE THERE IS LOTS OF 
ISSUES THAT IS HAPPENING LEER 
USUALLY WHEN WE TEND TO LOOK FOR 
THE ANSWERS TO THE PROBLEMS WE LOOK 
OUTSIDE OF THE PROBLEM BUT THE 
ANSWER IS ALWAYS INSIDE THE PROBLEM 
SO WE REALLY NEED TO START FROM 
HOME FROM THE PERSON OR THE CHILD 
WHO MADE THAT DECISION TO KILL 
SOMEONE OR TO STAB SOMEONE THAT 
IS VERY IMPORTANT 
RAY LEWIS YOU WILL HAVE LOT OF 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS IN LONDON 
BUT FROM YOUR GUT ARE WE ASKING 
THE WRONG QUESTIONS WHAT IS GOING 
ON 
KIRSTY SO MUCH 
IS GOING ON IT ON IS STAGGERING WE HAVE TO ASK 
OURSELVES WHY WE ARE WHERE WE ARE 
IN THE FIRST PLACE THIS IS NOT 
BLOW OUT IT IS A SLOW LEAK IT IS 
AN INCREASING AND STEADILY RISING 
ON SHRUEGT OF LAWLESSNESS AND 
ABANDONED BEHAVIOUR FOR A NUMBER OF 
YEARS I THINK ONSLOUGHT ALL 
TOO OFTEN WE ARE LOOKING OUTSIDE OF 
OURSELVES WHEN THE PROBLEMS ARE 
CLOSER TO HOME IT IS ABOUT US 
WHAT IS MY SON DOING ON THE 
STREETS AT KNIGHT WHERE ARE OUR 
CHILDREN WHY ARE WE NOT ASKING 
THESE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THESE 
ARE THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND 
ALSO AS ADULTS WE HAVE TO MAKE 
CERTAIN DECISIONS 
MELANIE PHILLIPS 
IS IT ABOUT CHAOS IN SOCIETY S. THAT THAT HA A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH IT 
THERE ARE MANY FACTORS AS SUGGESTED 
CLEARLY THE PREVALENCE OF DRUGS 
ALCOHOL OR OUR INABILITY OR 
FAILURE REFUSAL TO GET ON TOP OF 
THE TROUBLES IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR 
TO THE AGGRESSION AND THE VIOLENCE 
ON THE STREETS BUT WHERE THIS RAGE 
IS COMING FROM AS SUGGESTIONED IT 
IS COMING FROM WITHIN THE CHILDREN 
THERE ARE TWO POINTS I WANT TO MAKE 
FIRST OF ALL A LOT OF THEM ARE 
LITERALLY DRIVEN MADE BY RAGE AT 
THEIR FAMILY SITUATION THEIR 
ABSENCE OF FATHERS THE CHAOS IN 
WHICH THEY ARE BROUGHT UP SECONDLY 
THE PART OF THE RESULTS OF THE 
OUTCOME OF THAT CHAOS THEY ARE 
GIVEN SO FEW BOUNDARIES THAT THEIR 
INSTINCT WHEN THEY REACH ANY KIND 
OF FORK IN THE ROAD ANY KIND OF 
SETBACK IS TO BE VIOLENT TO BE 
AGGRESSIVE AGGRESSIVE ELOQUENTLY MARGARET MIZEN SAID SHE 
DID NOT WANT ANGER THAT IT WAS 
ANGER THAT CAUSED THIS WE NEEDED 
MORE LOVE WHERE DOES THE ANGER 
COMING FROM IS IT JEALOUSLY 
AVARICE THE DESPERATE NEED TO HAVE 
THINGS THINGS AT THE ROOTS OF ANGER IS GRIEF OUR 
CHILDREN ARE GRIEVING GRIEVING FOR 
THE LOSS OF FATHERS GRIEVING FOR 
THE LOSS OF THE LACK OF ASPIRATIONS 
GRIEVING AS THEY HAVE NO VALUES OR 
SENSE OF PURPOSE INTO THAT VACUUM 
WE HAVE PEOPLE AND YOUNG CHILDREN 
WHO WANT THINGS THAT WILL NEVER 
SATISFY SATISFY IT IS A SPIRITUAL CRISIS WHAT DO 
YOU THINK ABOUT THE IDEA HOW TO 
INSTILL A MORAL COMPASS IN THE 
SOCIETY IT HAS CHANGED FAMILIES 
COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES THERE 
IS NEVER A PERFECT FAMILY BUT 
WHERE DO YOU GET THE MORAL COMPASS 
FROM IN THE FIRST CENTURY 
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE FROM THE 
PARENTS 
MRS. MRS 
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE FROM 
PARENTS IF YOU LOOK BACK TO WHERE 
WE WERE BROUGHT UP THERE'S 
SUPPOSED TO BE A SET BACKGROUND A 
FOUNDATION FOR A CHILD FROM DAY ONE 
IF THAT CHILD DOESN'T HAVE THAT 
PARENTAL GUIDANCE FROM DAY ONE TO 
INFINITY THAT MEANS THERE'S 
SOMETHING WRONG IN THE FAMILY 
SETTING WHEN THAT FAMILY SETTING 
IS BROKEN YOU GET ALL THESE 
RESULTS ON THE STREET 
I SUPPOSE 
YOU'RE NODDING IN AGREEMENT YOU 
WOULD SAY AT SOME POINT THERE HAS 
TO BE A DEGREE OF PERSONAL 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR TEENAGERS TO 
WHO TAKE UP KNIVES DEFINITELY DEFINITELY THERE'S PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND 
HAS TO BE AND EVERYBODY WHO MAKES 
A DECISION HAS TO BE HELD 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT DECISION ONE 
THING WE MUST REMEMBER THAT 
DECISION DIDN'T COME JUST LIKE THAT 
IT IS A BUILD UP AS WE HEAR HEAR 
BEFORE FAMILIES AT HOME FAMILIES 
MAKE COMMUNITIES AND IT IS FROM 
THE FAMILIES YOU LEARN MORALS AND 
VALUES YOU LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH 
SITUATIONS WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY HOW 
TO USE SELF CONTROL IT IS WITHIN 
THE FAMILY CHILDREN GROW AND SEE 
THE THINGS HAPPENING AND COPY AND 
EMULATE THEM IT IS IMPORTANT WE 
WHO ARE ADULTS MUST LIVE LIVES FOR 
OUR CHILDREN AND ONCE THEY HAVE A 
GOOD GROUNDING AT HOME THEY WILL GO 
INTO THE COMMUNITY AND BE ABLE TO 
DEAL WITH THINGS THEY WILL MAKE 
MISTAKES AND THEY WILL LEARN FROM 
THAT THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT WE 
NEED TO GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING 
THE PROBLEM THE SOLUTION IS IN THE 
PROBLEM 
THERE'S IS ANOTHER FACTOR PROBLEM AS WE'RE SAYING IT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ROOT 
CAUSES THE OTHER PART OF THIS 
PROBLEM THE IS THE FAILURE BY 
INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITIES TO DEAL 
WITH IT 
THERE ISN'T AN PANACEA 
GIVE ME A SIMPLE IDEA SOMETHING SOMETHING HAS GONE TERRIBLY WRONG WITH 
POLICING THE POLICE HAVE ABANDONED 
THE STREETS TO THE GANGS THE 
REASONS FOR THAT ARE MANY VARIOUS 
AND COMPLEX IN MY VIEW THE ONLY 
SOLUTION TO THIS IS IN TERMS OF 
POLICING IS CURRENTLY COMMONLY 
CALLED ZERO TOLERANCE POLICING YOU 
LOOK AT SMALL AREAS 
THE WAY IT 
IS TACKLED IN AMERICA 
AND TACKLED 
IN HERE WHEN TACKLED HERE IT IS 
WITH SUCCESS 
SOME OF THE BLAME HAS 
TO REST PRESUMABLY WITH THE 
LEGISLATORS AND THE POLITICIANS 
WHO CREATE THE MORAL NOT THE 
MORAL BOUNDARIES BUT THE 
LEGISLATIVE BOUNDARIES CERTAINLY CERTAINLY PEOPLE WITH LEGISLATION HAVE A 
RESPONSIBILITY THERE IS A PROBLEM 
WITH POLICING IN THIS COUNTRY 
MAYOR JOHNSON IS WANTING TO WITH 
THIS AND TAKE A LEAD ON THIS L. 
THINK THERE'S A BIGGER PROBLEM ON 
HOW WE FACE THE PROBLEM WE HAVE 
LITTLE COMMUNITY AND UNTIL 
UNLESS WE RESTORE OUR COMMUNITY I I SUSPECT YOU HAVE TALKED TO EVERY 
SENIOR POLITICIAN IN THIS COUNTRY 
IT WAS EIGHT YEARS SINCE DAMOLOA 
WAS KILLED DO YOU FEEL A SENSE OF 
OPTIMISM 
THERE'S ALWAYS A OPTIMISM ASSURANCE THAT THE POLITICIANS ARE 
DOING ALL THEY CAN THE INITIATIVES 
THEY HAVE SUPPORTED WHICH THEY HAVE 
FUNDED AND WE HAVE SEEN EXAMPLES 
OF SUCH WE HAVE BEEN GOING TO 
SCHOOLS MENTORING YOUNG PEOPLE 
FROM THAT AGE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I 
CAN JUST SAY FOR NOW WE NEED TO 
TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT THE 
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF THESE YOUNG 
PEOPLE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM FOR 
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED 
FROM SCHOOL NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO 
MOST OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE AT A 
VERY TENDER AGES THEY ARE NOT IN 
MAINSTREAM 
THERE'S NOWHERE FOR MAINSTREAM THEM 
NOWHERE FOR THEM THEY GET ON THEM THE STREET AND START CREATING 
PROBLEMS ON THE STREET THESE ARE 
THE YOUNG PEOPLE YOU FIND IN MOST 
CASES GOING OUT WITH KNIVES AND 
YOU KNOW CAUSING HAVOC ON THE 
STREETS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE STREETS IDEA OF ZERO TOLERANCE ZERO ZERO TOLERANCE IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE 
LOOKING AT IT HAS BECOME SUCH A 
THING PEOPLE LIKE US WHO HAVE 
EXPERIENCE TRAGEDY IN THIS FORM 
FEELS THAT THERE'S NOT BEEN MUCH 
DONE IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH THE 
ISSUES AT THE POINT ZERO 
TOLERANCE SHOULD BE USED IN 
DEALING WITH THE MATTER 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH 
SUCH WAS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE 
EARTHQUAKE IN SOUTH WEST CHINA THAT 
SHOCKS WERE FELT ALL OVER THE 
COUNTRY AND THE REMOTENESS OF THE 
EPICENTRE IN SICHUAN PROVINCE HAS 
PROVED A HUGE OBSTACLE TO THE 
RESCUE WORKERS WE KNOW AT LEAST 
NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND MANY 
HUNDREDS ARE STILL TRAPPED IT IS 
CHINA'S WORST NATURAL DISASTER IN 
THREE DECADES THE NUMBERS ARE 
BOUND TO RISE 
DESPERATE IMAGES FROM THE CITY OF 
DUJIANGYAN ONE OF THE WORST HIT 
AREAS OF SICHUAN TODAY NINE HUNDRED 
TEENAGERS ARE THOUGHT TO BE TRAPPED 
IN THE RUBBLE OF THEIR SCHOOL 
BUILDING AND A HOSPITAL IN THE SAME 
CITY WAS EVACUATED THE PRIME 
MINISTER VISITED THE CITY THIS 
EVENING AND CALLED THE QUAKE A 
MAJOR DISASTER 
THE BODY COUNT WILL RISE OVER THE 
NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS AS RESCUERS CLEAR 
ROADS BLOCKED BY LANDSLIDES THAT 
HAVE CUT OFF VILLAGES UP IN THE 
MOUNTAINS THE EARTHQUAKE STRUCK 
THE SICHUAN PROVINCE IN SOUTH 
WESTERN CHINA WITH THE EPICENTRE 
IN THE MOUNTAINS NORTH WEST OF 
CHENGDU THE SEVENTY EIGHT QUAKE STRUCK AT 
MID AFTERNOON AND WAS FOLLOWED BY 
MORE THAN FORTY AFTERSHOCKS THE 
LARGEST WAS A SIX 
I WAS TEACHING IN 
A SCHOOL IN SOUTHERN CHINA AS I 
WAS STANDING TEACHING THE BOARD 
STARTED TO SHAING AND THE WINDOWS 
STARTED TO RATTLE ONE OF THE 
STUDENTS SHOUTED EARTHQUAKE AND 
SUDDENLY THE CLASS WAS EMPTY L. 
FOLLOWED THEM OUTSIDE SO FAR I'VE 
HEARD OF FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE DEAD THAT IS A 
REPORT FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY A 
BUILDING ACROSS THE ROAD FROM ME 
COLLAPSED AND SEVERAL HOMES HAVE 
COLLAPSED I KNOW ONE MAN IN MY 
APARTMENT BLOCK JUMPING OUT OF A 
WINDOW AND KIEG DYING AND IN A 
LOCAL SCHOOL I KNOW SEVERAL 
CHILDREN DIED WHEN A ROOF COLLAPSED 
ON THEM 
THIS IS DUE TO A COLLISION 
BETWEEN THE INDIAN PLATE AND THE 
EURASIAN PLATE IT IS A COLLISION 
OVER A COMPLEX OF FAULTS THE DEPTH 
OF FOCUS WAS TEN KILOMETRES THAT 
MEANS THAT THE SEISMIC ACTIVITY HAS 
BEEN RELEASED CLOSE TO THE SURFACE 
THE ENERGY HAS NOT BEEN ABSORBED BY 
LAYERS OF ROCK AND ANY BUILDINGS 
NEAR THE FAULT WOULD HAVE RECEIVED 
THE FULL FAULT OF THE SHAKING 
TODAY'S QUAKE WILL REAWAKEN 
MEMORIES OF THE INFAMOUS NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX 
TANGSHAN EARTHQUAKE IN WHICH 
OFFICIALLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED 
UNOFFICIALLY IT WAS AT LEAST THREE 
TIMES THAT NUMBER THE CHINESE 
AUTHORITIES CLOSED THE BORDERS AND 
DENIED THE SCALE OF THE ACTIVITY 
THIS TIME EXPERTS EXPECT A 
DIFFERENT REACTION 
NOW THE PEOPLE 
EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND 
QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO THIS 
NATURAL DISASTER AND ALSO YOU HAVE 
THE EXPECTATION FROM THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY 
IN THE SPECIAL YEAR WHEN CHINA IS 
ABOUT TO HOST THE OLYMPICS WHEN 
THERE'S A MAJOR DISASTER LIKE THIS 
HOW THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDS HOW IT 
HANDLES NOT JUST CHINESE PEOPLE BUT 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS ALSO 
WATCHING VERY CLOSELY CHINESE CHINESE GOVERNMENT MAY ARGUABLY BE MOVING 
SWIFTLY NOW TO DEAL WITH THE 
DISASTER WHERE THEY ARE OPEN TO 
CRITICISM IS NOT HAVING DONE ALL 
THEY COULD TO PROTECT THEIR PEOPLE 
FROM HARM IN THE FIRST PLACE 
THERE'S HUGE PROBLEM WORLDWIDE IN 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY 
THERE'S LOT MORE PEOPLE AND 
BUILDINGS THEY ARE NOT CONSTRUCTED 
IN ORDER TO COPE WITH EARTHQUAKES 
GOVERNMENTS NEED TO SPEND SOMETIME 
AND EFFORT AND MONEY TO MAKE SURE 
BUILDINGS ARE CONSTRUCTED PROPERLY 
IF THEY DON'T MANY MANY MORE 
PEOPLE WILL DIE PARTICULARLY IN 
CHINA WHERE WE HAVE HAD EARTHQUAKES 
KILLING HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND OF 
PEOPLE IN THE PAST 
LAST TIME THERE 
WAS AN EARTHQUAKE OF SIMILAR SCALE 
ON THE SAME FAULTLINE IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE 
NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES THEN 
THE REGION IS FAR MORE DENSELY 
POPULATED NOW THE ONLY GOOD NEWS 
PERHAPS IS HAVING SEEN ONE LARGE 
AFTERSHOCK SIGHS MOLGTS SAY IT'S 
LESS LIKELY THERE WILL BE ANOTHER 
IN 
THE NEXT SAY OR SO L. SPOKE TO THE B. B. C.'S CORRESPONDANT IN BEIJING 
I BEGAN BY ASKING FOR LATEST IN THE 
SITUATION 
CHINA IS FACING THE SITUATION LARGEST NATURAL DISASTER THAT IT 
HAS FACED IN MANY DECADES THIS WAS 
A VERY SEVERE EARTHQUAKE SEVENTY EIGHT IN 
TERMS OF MAGNITUDE IT STRUCK IN 
THE WORST TIME TWO HUNDRED THIRTY WHILE 
CHILDREN WERE IN THE SCHOOLS AND 
WORKERS IN THE FACTORIES AND 
OFFICES IT WAS SUCH A POWERFUL 
EARTHQUAKE WE FELT IT IN BEIJING 
WE'RE A GOOD ONE THOUSAND MILES FROM THE 
EPICENTRE IT WAS ALSO FELT IN 
SHANGHAI AND HONG KONG THIS IS OF 
A MAGNITUDE CHINA HASN'T SEEN FOR 
SOMETIME 
HOW ARE PEOPLE REACTING SOMETIME AT THE EPICENTRE 
IT IS WENCHUAN 
COUNTY DEEP IN THE MOUNTAINS WE 
ARE HEARING FROM SICHUAN PROVINCE 
ESTIMATES OF NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED 
THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
PEOPLE IN THE EPICENTRE NO ONE HAS 
BEEN ABLE TO REACH THAT YET FOUR 
HELICOPTERS TO TURN BACK THE 
WEATHER WAS SO BAD THEY ARE 
TALKING ABOUT MOUNTAINOUS RURAL 
AREAS THE P. L. A. RAPIDLY DEPLOYED 
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REACH THE 
SURVIVORS THERE COMMUNICATIONS ARE 
DOWN WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING 
FROM THE COUNTY 
THIS HAS LITERALLY 
SENT SHOCKWAVES ACROSS CHINA 
PEOPLE MUST BE DESPERATE TO KNOW 
WHAT IS GOING ON ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE STATE NEWS 
SERVICE WAS PROVIDING MINUTE BY 
MINUTE UPDATES 
DIFFERENT FROM HOW THEY BEHAVED IN 
THE PAST THERE'S A GROWING 
APPETITE AMONG ORDINARY JOURNALISTS 
WHETHER YOU WORK FOR THE STATE NEWS 
OR THE BROADCASTERS TO GET CLOSER 
TO THE NEWS TO GET THERE IN A 
TIMELY FASHION EVEN IF THAT MEANS 
TRYING TO AVOID ROADBLOCKS AND IT 
SEEMS THE LEADERSHIP WERE HAPPIER 
FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR ABOUT THE 
SITUATION ON THE GROUND AND HOW 
THEY ARE RESPONDING TO IT 
PSYCHOLOGICALY FRAUD WAS HOW 
DESCRIBED A DECADE AGO BY LABOUR INSIDER INSIDER THE PRIME MINISTER'S VOLATILITY IS 
LEGEND YESTERDAY FRANK FIELD SAID 
HE BEEN ON THE SEEFRG END OF HIS 
RAGE HE SAID IT WAS TIME FOR 
GORDON BROWN TO GO 
LORD LEVY LONG STANDING CHUM OF 
TONY BLAIR AND FORMER LABOUR 
FUNDRAISER TO THE TUNE HE RECKONS 
OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE PAST HE HAS 
ALWAYS SAID NO TO MY INTERVIEW BIDS 
HOW ABOUT NOW 
WHY NOT MICHAEL L. 
TAKE IT THIS LADY IS FROM NEWSNIGHT 
SUDDENLY A CAMERA COMES THERE YOU 
GO 
SUDDENLY A CAMERA COMES THERE YOU GO GO IT ALL WENT WRONG FOR GORDON BROWN 
HE SAYS LAST AUTUMN WHEN HE 
DIDN'T CALL AN ELECTION 
THERE WAS 
A SEA CHANGE IN HOW THE PUBLIC 
RELATED 
TO HIM 
AND REACTED TO HIM 
FROM THEN ON IT SEEMED TO REALLY 
STEADILY DETERIORATE L. THINK 
THAT'S RATHER SAD THAT THINGS SEEM 
TO HAVE GOT PROGRESSIVELY BAD SINCE 
THEN 
DO YOU AGREE WITH WHAT YOU THEN QUOTE TONY BLAIR SAYING THAT HE 
DOESN'T THINK THAT GORDON BROWN WIN 
AN ELECTION 
I THINK 
IT WILL 
WIN AN ELECTION VERY HARD FOR HIM YOU KNOW IT 
COULD BE TWO YEARS TO AN ELECTION 
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN TWO YEARS 
DAVID CAMERON COULD MAKE MISTAKES 
THINGS COULD GET BETTER FOR GORDON 
THE ECONOMY COULD TURN AROUND 
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN POLITICS AS 
WE STAND HERE TODAY IT'S GOING TO 
BE EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT FOR 
HIM TO WIN THE ELECTION 
LORD LEVY'S IS ONE OF THREE MEMOIRS 
I HAVE TO READ THIS MONTH ALL FROM 
COMBUSTABLE NEW LABOUR FIGURES ALL 
LESS THAN HELPFUL TO THE CURRENT P. M. 
FOR INSTANCE LEVY WRITES ON THE 
TWO THOUSAND SIX PLOT TO OUST BLAIR 
HE SAYS IN HER BOOK CHERIE BLAIR SAYS ACCORDING TO JOHN PRESCOTT 
GORDON BROWN CAN HARDLY COMPLAIN 
ABOUT WHAT'S WRITTEN IN BOOKS 
AFTER ALL FOR MANY YEARS SOME OF 
HIS CLOSEST ALLIES USED TO USE 
BOOKS TO DELIVER THE MOST 
DEVASTATING DARTS AGAINST TONY 
BLAIR AND HIS FRIENDS THERE WAS 
THE PAUL ROUT LIJ BIOGRAPHY OF 
PETER MANDELSON WHICH FORCED MR. 
MANDELSON TO RESIGN FOR THE FIRST 
TIME THEN WE HAD ROBERT PESTON'S 
BIOGRAPHY OF MR. BROWN 
THE FAMOUS QUOTE PUBLISHED ON THE 
BACK OF GORDON BROWN TO TONY BLAIR 
SAYING THERE'S NOTHING YOU COULD 
EVER SAY TO ME NOW THAT I COULD 
EVER BELIEVE HARD TO THINK OF 
MORE DAMAGING QUOTE THAN THAT 
MR. BROWN TODAY TRIED TO CONCENTRATE 
ON GOVERNING AHEAD OF WEDNESDAY'S 
DRAFT QUEEN'S SPEECH DESPITE THE 
LEADER OF THE TEN P. TAX REBELS 
SUGGESTING HE MIGHT NOT LAST THE 
SUMMER 
WITH THIS BUDGET COMING UP SUMMER WITH THE TEN P. CUT IN THE FIRST RATE 
OF TAX WHICH HAS CAUSED ANGER NOT 
OF THE LIKE I HAVE SEEN ON THE 
LABOUR BACKBENCHES EVER BEFORE IF 
WE DON'T GET A SATISFACTORY DEAL I 
THINK THERE'S ENOUGH MEMBERS ON THE 
LABOUR BACKBENCHES WHO WILL WITHS 
OR BLOCK THE BUDGET GOING THROUGH 
AND THAT WILL MAKE HIS POSITION 
INTOLERABLE AT THAT STAGE 
BACK AT LEVY'S LAUNCH OTHERS TOO 
THOUGHT MR. BROWN COULD BE TOPPLED 
ESPECIALLY IF THE CREWE BY ELECTION 
GOES BADLY WRONG 
I WOULDN'T RULE 
OUT SOME KIND OF A CHALLENGE TO 
GORDON BROWN SOME TIME THIS SUMMER 
IF THINGS REALLY GO 
CATASTROPHICALLY WRONG FOR LABOUR 
IN CREWE IT IS POSSIBLE THEY MIGHT 
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ALL THE MUMS 
ARE SO BAD FOR LABOUR AT THE MOMENT 
BUT LEVY ALSO QUESTIONS GORDON 
BROWN'S VORACITY AFTER THE P. M. TWO 
WEEKS AGO TOLD M. P.'S HE KNEW NOTHING 
OF THE NOTORIOUS LOANS WHICH LEVY 
RAISED FOR THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN WHICH BROWN OFFICIALLY 
RAN 
I HAVE NLY SAID THAT I FIND RAN IT VERY STRANGE I SAID REALLY MOST 
INCONCEIVABLE IF SOMEONE IS 
RUNNING AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN THEN 
ONE WOULD NATURALLY ASSUME THEY 
WOULD KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON 
CERTAINLY SOMEONE WHO IS PRETTY 
OBIVE ABOUT DETAIL 
OBSESSIVE ABOUT DETAIL 
IN DOWNING STREET MEANWHILE MR. 
BROWN WAS HAVING A BIT OF FUN AT AN 
AWARDS CEREMONY FOR THE FOOTBALL 
CAMPAIGN SHOW RACISM THE RED CARD 
BUT THE RED CARD IS NOT THE MOST 
WELCOME SIGNAL AS LABOUR M. P.'S ARE 
INCREASINGLY DISCUSSING IF WHEN 
AND IS THERE ANY SUBSTITUTE 
COMING UP IN THE PROGRAMME 
WHAT IS THE TRUE COST OF LIVING 
THESE DAYS WE FIND OUT 
FIRST A ROUND UP OF TODAY'S NEWS 
THE MAIN STORY TONIGHT RELATIVES 
OF THE MURDERED TEENAGER JIMMY 
MIZEN HAVE DESCRIBED THEIR SHOCK 
FOLLOWING HIS DEATH ON SATURDAY AT 
A BAKERY IN SOUTH EAST LONDON THE 
INCIDENT HAS INCREASED CONCERNS 
ABOUT TEENAGERS KILLING OTHER 
TEENAGERS THE DEPUTY MAYOR OF 
LONDON TOLD NEWSNIGHT TONIGHT THAT 
THE PROBLEM IS WORSENING THIS THIS ISN'T A BLOWOUT THIS IS A SLOW 
LEAK THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREASING 
AND STEADILY RISING ONSLAUGHT OF 
LAWLESSNESS AND ABANDONED BEHAVIOUR 
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS 
BRITAIN HAS 
CALLED ON BURMA'S MILITARY 
GOVERNMENT TO GIVE INTERNATIONAL 
AID WORKERS FREE ACCESS TO 
SURVIVORS OF CYCLONE NARGIS THE 
FIRST U. S. PLANE CARRYING SUPPLIES 
ARRIVED TODAY ON THE CONDITION 
THAT IT WAS DISTRIBUTED BY BURM 
M. E. E. S. MILITARY

HOW BAD ARE THINGS REALLY BEYOND 
THE WORLD OF THE TABLOIDS HOW MUCH 
IS THE COST OF LIVING ACTUALLY 
RISING BY 
WHETHER IT'S SCREAMING HEADLINES OR 
SHOCKS AT THE PETROL PUMPS WE ARE 
ALL FEELING THE PINCH REPORTS ARE 
THAT WE HAVE LESS TO SPEND THAN SEVENTEEN 
YEARS 
FOOD INFLATION 
STANDS AT NINETEEN PER CENT FOLLOWING HOT ON THE 
HEELS OF THE TEN P. TAX DEBACLE NOT 
TO MENTION OIL AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A BARREL IT 
ALL LOOKS LIKE THE PRESSURE ON OUR 
WALLETS MAY BECOMING INTOLERABLE 
ACCORDING TO REPORTS BREAD HAS BEEN 
SOARING OVER FORTY PER CENT RICE OVER SIXTY PER CENT 
AND PASTA OVER EIGHTY PER CENT ARE WE REALLY 
THAT BADLY OFF OR IS THE TRUE 
SITUATION MORE LIKE THE OFFICIAL 
STATISTICS WHICH SHOW THAT 
INFLATION IS RISING BUT NOT 
RIDICULOUSLY 
EVERY TIME YOU GO RIDICULOUSLY SHOPPING WHATEVER YOU DO WHATEVER 
YOU WANTED TO BUY EVERY TIME IT IS 
HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER I I THINK YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY TO FIGHT 
TO GET IT BACK IN YOUR WAGE PACKET 
AND IN OTHER WAYS EVERYONE HAS TO 
START CUTTING 
BACK ON THINGS 
DOESN'T 
HAVE THAT 
AMOUNT OF MONEY 
THAT ONE USED TO HAVE 
I DON'T DARE 
GO FOR A COFFEE NOW THAT ADDS TO 
EVERYTHING ELSE 
THAT ONE HAS TO 
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT ONE HAS TO SPEND SPEND IT IS PHENOMENAL ALL THE FACTS AND 
FIGURES SAYING IT HAS ONLY RISEN BY 
SO MUCH IT DOESN'T 
SEEM TO 
BE 
WAY WHEN YOU ARE BUYING THINGS 
THEY DON'T 
SEEM 
TO INCLUDE THE 
SAME 
THINGS THAT WE DO 
THERE IS CERTAINLY STRONG 
PERCEPTION THAT THIS IS THE SO WHAT DO THEY 
LOOK AT 
IN THE 
GOVERNMENT DATA IN THE R. P. I. OR 
RETAIL PRICE INDEX AND THE C. P. I. OR 
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX THE FIRST 
CURRENTLY STANDS AT THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT AND THE 
SECOND AT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT FIGURES WELL BELOW 
THE SORT SUGGESTED BY THESE 
COMMENTS COMMENTS THE OFFICIAL MEASURES OF INFLATION 
INCLUDE VIRTUALLY EVERY ELEMENT OF 
OUR LIVES THEY WILL TAKE INTO 
ACCOUNT THE COST OF ALL THE STUFF 
IN MY LARDER HERE THE CONTENTS OF 
MY FRIDGE 
THERE IS ALSO THE BOOZE AS LONG AS 
YOU DON'T LOOK TOO CAREFULLY THERE 
THEN OF COURSE THERE IS THE CAR 
AND THE PETROL C. D.'S TAPES AND HI 
FIS THERE IS ALSO THE FURNITURE 
THEN THERE'S THE KIDS TOYS BOOKS 
AND NEWSPAPERS 
AND HOLIDAYS 
THEN THERE'S HEATING LIGHTING ALL 
FORMS OF ENERGY AND THERE'S THE 
COST OF YOUR TELEPHONE AND YOUR 
INTERNET SO THAT'S WHAT THE R. P. I. 
AND THE C. P. I. HAVE IN COMMON THERE 
ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM ONE 
IS THE WAY THE MATHS WORKS TWO IS 
THE SIGNIFICANCE THAT THEY ACTUALLY 
ACCORD TO THAT LONG LIST OF 
PRODUCTS THREE MOST CRUCIALLY IS 
THE WAY THEY TREAT BRICKS AND 
MORTAR THE C. P. I. EXCLUDE ALL 
MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS AND 
COUNCIL TAX 
AND YET IT IS THE C. P. I. WHICH WAS 
BROUGHT IN AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND THREE 
WHICH BECAME THE INDEX BY THE 
MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE HAS TO 
MONITOR AND TARGET IT HAS 
CONSISTENTLY REMAINED BELOW THE R. P. I. 
PRECISELY BECAUSE IT EXCLUDE COSTS 
BORNE BY HOME OWNERS THE REASON 
FOR INTRODUCING IT WAS HARMONISING 
INFLATION ACROSS EUROPE MANY 
ECONOMISTS BELIEVE TO BE USEFUL THE 
MEASURE OF INFLATION SHOULD BE 
BROADER 
WE ALREADY HAVE MEASURE BROADER THAT IS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE 
MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS PERHAPS 
WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING THAT 
INCLUDES THE REPAYMENTS HOUSEHOLDS 
MADE ON THE DEBT AND INSECURED DEBT 
WE MIGHT GO WIDER AND TAKE IN HOW 
MUCH HOUSEHOLDERS HAVE TO SAVE UP 
TO PUT 
A DEPOSIT ON THE HOUSE 
WOULD REQUIRE OF WORK THERE ARE NO 
PLANS TO 
MAKE 
UP THE 
BROADER 
MEASURE OF 
THE 
COST OF 
LIVING IT WOULD BE WELCOME 
THE OFFICIAL DATA IS METICULOUSLY 
GATHERED BRENDA IS ONE OF AN ARMY 
OF ELECTORS WHOSE TASK IT IS TO 
PICK OUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PRICE AS MONTH ON 
SIX HUNDRED FIFTY PRODUCTS FOR FOURTEEN YEARS EVERY 
MONTHS SHE HAS BEEN POUNDING THE 
AISLE HER TASK IS TO MAKE SURE THE 
ITEMS CHOSEN EACH TIME ARE SIMILAR 
IN WEIGHT DESCRIPTION AND BRANDING 
WHEN YOU GO AROUND ARE YOU VERY 
AWARE HOW MUCH THE PRICES HAVE GONE 
UP OR DOWN OH 
HAVE THE 
PRICE THAT 
WE HAD LAST MONTH THE 
PREVIOUS FOUR WEEKS AND ALSO WE 
HAVE A HISTORY WE CAN CHECK BACK 
ON OUR HISTORY FOR THE PREVIOUS SIX 
MONTHS WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS 
HAPPENING OVER A SIX MONTH PERIOD 
PEOPLE SAY THERE IS 
A LOT 
OF 
INFLATION IN 
THE SYSTEM 
ARE YOU 
FINDING THAT AS YOU GO AROUND 
TESTING ALL THESE PRICES NOT NOT REALLY SOME 
PRICES HAVE 
GONE UP 
AND OTHERS HAVE GONE DOWN 
THIS MIXED PICTURE IS A FAR CRY 
FROM WHAT OTHER FAR NARROWER 
STUDIES HAVE FOUND SEVERAL 
NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS QUOTE A REPORT 
WRITTEN BY MY SUPERMARKET AN ON 
LINE COMPANY ITS LATEST FIGURE OUT 
TODAY CLAIMS THAT FOOD INFLATION IS 
ACTUALLY NINETEEN PER CENT SO WHY THE HUGE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND THE 
GOVERNMENT DATA THE ANSWER IS 
ACTUALLY RELATIVELY SIMPLE WHERE 
AS THE OFFICIAL DATA LOOKS AT 
THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS AS WE HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT THE MY SUPERMARKET 
REPORT LOOKS AT ONLY TWO OR THREE 
DOZEN FOOD PRODUCTS JUST THESE 
HOW ON EARTH CAN THE REPORT'S 
AUTHOR JUSTIFY DRAWING SUCH STRONG 
CONCLUSIONS FROM SUCH MEAGRE DATA SAMPLE 
I AGREE PEOPLE DO BUY A SAMPLE BROADER RANGE OF ITEMS WE HAVE 
DONE ANALYSIS ON BASKETS PEOPLE ARE 
SHOPPING FOR ON THE SITE AND WE 
HAVE LOOKED AT WHAT PROPORTION THE 
BASKET IS ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE 
BASIC ITEMS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
BETWEEN FOUR 
I'M SORRY WE SEEM 
TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT IF YOU 
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE PART IN A B. B. C. 
EXPRPLT TO DISCOVER HOW THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH IS BITING ACROSS THE U. K. USE 
THE LINK TO THE MAPPING BRITAIN 
EXPERIMENT WE CAN GO BACK TO THE 
REPORT NOW 
WHETHER IT'S NINETEEN PER CENT OR TEN PER CENT IT IS STILL 
VASTLY MORE THAN THE OFFICIAL RATE 
THAT RATE ITSELF IS SIMPLY AN 
AVERAGE OR MEAN CLEARLY BY 
DEFINITION IT CAN'T REFLECT REALITY 
FOR EVERYONE 
WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THERE IS A 
WIDE VARIATION OF INFLATION AROUND 
THE CENTRAL HEADLINE RATE SO IN 
ANY ONE YEAR THERE MIGHT BE 
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CLOSE TO THE 
MEAN BUT IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT 
SOMEBODY WILL BE DEAD ON THE 
HEADLINE RATE AND THERE IS A 
VARIATION AROUND THAT 
WHAT HAS 
DONE BETTER AND 
WHO HAS 
DONE 
AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE THE PRICE OF 
FOOD AND FUEL HAS GONE UP QUICKLY 
POORER PEOPLE SPEND A LARGER AMOUNT 
OF MONEY ON THOSE GOODS THEY WILL 
EXPERIENCE HIGHER INFLATION THAN 
RICHER PEOPLE THAT IS NOT ALWAYS 
THE CASE OVER THE NINETEEN EIGHTY IN THE 
BEGINNING OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES POORER 
PEOPLE HAD HIGHER INFLATION RATES 
THAN RICHER PEOPLE 
BY THE 
END OF 
THE PERIOD THAT SITUATION WAS 
REVERSED REVERSED THE BENEFITS AND THE PAIN MAY SHIFT 
CONSTANTLY BETWEEN RICH AND POOR 
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PRICE CHANGES 
APPARENTLY WE ALL HAVE BLIND SPOTS 
PEOPLE I THINK DON'T ALWAYS 
NOTICE WHEN PRICES ARE GOING DOWN 
THEY TEND TO NOTICE MORE WHEN 
PRICES ARE GOING UP IF WE THINK 
ABOUT THE PATTERNS THE WAY PRICES 
ARE MOVING WE FIND ALSO THAT THE 
PRICES THAT ARE GOING UP ARE ITEMS 
PEOPLE ARE BUYING REGULARLY SUCH 
AS FOOD AND PETROL SOME OF THE 
ITEM THAT IS ARE FALL ITEM THAT 
IS ARE FALL ANYTHING PRICE ARE 
THINGS LIKE FLAT SCREEN COMPUTERS 
OR TELEVISION 
MAYBE THAT IS THE 
REASON WHY SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE 
IMPRESSION THAT THEIR OWN COST OF 
LIVING IS VERY HIGH TO TEST 
WHETHER THESE IMPRESSIONS ARE 
ACCURATE WE GATHERED A TEST GROUP 
OF THREE IN ASDA CAFE 
LUXURIES HAVE KIND OF GONE OUT OF 
THE WINDOW BECAUSE NOW THE DAY TO 
DAY COST OF LIVING HAS INCREASED SO 
MUCH FOR A FAMILY OF FIVE IT HAS 
BECOME VERY EXTENSIVE WE WENT TO 
THE CINEMA RECENTLY AND THAT WAS 
LIKE A DAY 
OUT IT 
WAS HUGE PRICE 
FOR ALL OF US 
IT MAKES ME VERY 
ANGRY WE ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING 
HARDER SPENDING 
MORE TIME 
DOING 
ALL THESE 
THINGS TO EARN MORE MONEY 
AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE ANY 
DIFFERENCE OR IMPROVE OUR LIFESTYLE 
USTILLITY BILLS INSURANCE FOR THE 
UTILITY BILLS INSURANCE FOR THE 
CAR AND HOME PARKING YOUR VEHICLE 
IT IS NOT JUST FOOD BIZARRELY 
THERE SEEMS TO BE AN UNUSUAL FLIP 
SIDE AT THE SAME TIME 
AS YOUR 
HOUSEHOLD FOOD 
IS GOING UP 
AND UP 
AND UP YOU SEE AN ADVERT FOR A T. 
SHIRT FOR SEVENTY P. I DON'T QUITE 
UNDERSTAND THAT HOW DID A 
BECOME THE SAME PRICE AS A CAN OF 
COKE 
WE INPUT EVERY PERSON'S COKE SPENDING DATA INTO THE OFFICE FOR 
NATIONAL STATISTIC'S WEBSITE AND 
CALCULATED THEIR INDIVIDUAL 
INFLATION RATE BECKY'S RATE WORKS 
OUT AT FIFTY SEVEN PER CENT PAUL'S IS SEVENTY SEVEN BUT 
SARAH'S CAME OUT THE HIGHEST SIXTY FIVE PER CENT 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN HIGHER I 
HAVE TO SAY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT IS HIGHER HAVING 
SAID THAT SIXTY FIVE PER CENT IS STILL AN AWFUL 
LOT MORE THAN OUR INCOME OUR 
INCOME HAS GONE UP BY ZERO 
WE LIVE 
TO QUITE A TIGHT BUDGET ALREADY SO 
IT FEELS QUITE DAUNTING TO THINK 
WHERE ELSE DO WE CUT BACK ON I I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT WHY WHY DID YOU THINK THAT 
MOSTLY THE FOOD 
BILL T. HAS FELT ABOUT THAT HIGH 
FOOD IS LITTLE PROPORTION OF YOUR SPENDING 
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A SPENDING LITTLE PROPORTION BECAUSE IT IS SO 
FREQUENT 
IT IS SUCH A PITY THAT MY FREQUENT HUSBAND WORKS INCREDIBLY HARD HE 
OFTEN DOES OVERTIME AS WELL AND 
YET WE SEEM TO BE WORKING JUST TO 
AFFORD TO LIVE AT THE MOMENT NOT 
WORKING TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY LIFE 
AND OPPORTUNITIES AND THINGS 
THERE'S REAL SENSE THAT PEOPLE 
SIMPLY DON'T BELIEVE THE 
GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL DATA ON 
INFLATION THEY FEEL IT DOESN'T 
REFLECT THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE OF THE 
SOARING COST OF LIVING WITH 
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AT A FIFTEEN YEAR 
LOW MAYBE IT IS THE TIME TO 
CONSIDER A BROADER MEASURE OF 
INFLATION CLEARLY THAT 
IS NOT 
GOING TO HAPPEN ANY MOMENT SOON 
BUT TO BE FRANK IN THE CURRENT 
CLIMATE IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER ANY 
OFFICIAL MEASURE OF INFLATION WILL 
BE TRUSTED THE PUBLIC ARE SIMPLY 
TOO PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE ECONOMIC
