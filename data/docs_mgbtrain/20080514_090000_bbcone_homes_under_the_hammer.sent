WE BOTH LOVE THE AUCTION ROOM TOO WHERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
EVERY YEAR BUY THEIR HOMES UNDER THE HAMMER 
WE'RE CONSTANTLY AMAZED BY THE STORIES WE FOLLOW OUT OF THE AUCTION ROOMS 
SOME REAL LIFE DRAMAS AND SOME REAL LIFE SUCCESSES 
WE'VE FOUND ANOTHER THREE PROPERTIES THAT HAVE SOLD SO LET'S SEE WHAT STORIES THEY HAVE TO TELL 
IN DERBY THERE'S A THREE BEDROOMED HOUSE MAKING SOME SWEET MUSIC 
A PIANO HOW FANTASTIC 
IS IT A BLIND DATE THAT'S GONE HORRIBLY WRONG IN LONDON 
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO WAKE UP AND LOOK AT THAT THING EVERY MORNING 
OR JUST AN UGLY GARDEN 
WHILE IN CARDIFF I GO PROSPECTING FOR TREASURE WITH A LARGE GREEN SPACE 
THAT IS WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD 
ALL THESE PROPERTIES WERE SOLD AT AUCTION 
WE FIND OUT WHO BOUGHT THEM AND HOW MUCH THEY PAID FOR THEM WHEN THEY WENT UNDER THE HAMMER 
I'M FOUR MILES SOUTH OF DERBY CITY CENTRE IN AN AREA KNOWN AS SHELTON LOCK 
SO NAMED BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE DERBY CANAL USED TO PASS THROUGH HERE 
AND PRESUMABLY AT ONE POINT THERE WAS A LOCK 
NOWADAYS IT IS LEAFY SUBURBIA LARGELY MADE UP OF NINETEEN THIRTIES SEMIS LIKE THIS ONE 
INTERESTING ENOUGH SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO THIS SOLD FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND QUID JUST A YEAR AGO 
SO WHEN YOU HEAR THAT THIS ONE IS UP AT AUCTION WITH A GUIDE PRICE OF NINETY FIVE THOUSAND IT'S GOT TO BE WORTH A LOOK 
TAKING A QUICK LOOK AT THE EXTERNAL FEATURES IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THEY'RE IN NEED OF SOME T. L. C. 
BUT THERE'S THE PLEASANT SURPRISE OF A GARAGE AT THE BACK 
AND BY PEEPING OVER THE NEIGHBOUR'S FENCE YOU GET AN IDEA OF WHAT AN EXTENSION WOULD DO FOR THE HOUSE 
SO THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND STRAIGHTAWAY YOU GET THE IDEA 
THAT THIS PLACE HASN'T HAD A LOT DONE TO IT SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
LOOK AT THIS WALLPAPER ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC FAIRLY STANDARD LAYOUT 
NO NASTY SMELLS WHICH IS ALWAYS A NICE THING WHEN YOU WALK IN STAIRS UP TO THE BEDROOMS 
REASONABLE SIZE CORRIDOR HERE AND THEN THROUGH TO THE LIVING ROOMS THE FRONT ONE OVER HERE 
NICE TO SEE THE FLOORBOARDS NOT A BAD SIZE 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO EXPECT SOMETHING RADICALLY DIFFERENT IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS IT'S A NINETEEN THIRTIES SEMI 
BUT YOU'VE GOT A GOOD LOT OF LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE WINDOWS AND YOU'VE GOT A PIANO 
HOW FANTASTIC 
AND IT'S IN TUNE EXTRAORDINARY 
THROUGH TO THE KITCHEN AND THIS IS WHERE IT STARTS TO GO A BIT WRONG 
COS REALLY THIS PLACE HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES I LIKE THE TILING 
I LIKE THE BELFAST SINK BUT MORE SERIOUS THAN THAT ARE LEAD PIPES 
THEY NEED TO COME OUT IT'S A HEALTH RISK GET RID OF THOSE STRAIGHTAWAY 
BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE IS IT'S JUST FAR TOO SMALL FOR THE SIZE OF THE HOUSE 
YOU'VE GOT TWO OPTIONS YOU CAN EXTEND OUT THE BACK 
OR TWO POSSIBLY MY FAVOURITE OPTION IS TO TAKE OUT THIS WALL 
IT IS FAIRLY SOLID IT'S BRICK THAT NOT A STUD PARTITION 
A BIT OF WORK TO DO THAT BUT IT WOULD AFFECT THE WHOLE FEEL OF THE HOUSE 
TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THIS KITCHEN MAYBE MAKE IT INTO A KITCHEN DINER 
IF YOU TOOK OUT THE WALL THE KITCHEN COULD THEN JOIN INTO THIS WELL SIZED DINING LIVING SPACE 
CREATING A LOVELY FAMILY ROOM 
AND IF FINANCES ALLOWED IT I'D EXTEND INTO THE GARDEN TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE 
THEN YOU'D HAVE A PROPERTY SCALING NEW HEIGHTS 
SO UP THE STAIRS AND NO GREAT SURPRISES IN STORE 
OR SO YOU WOULD THINK 
BECAUSE LOOK AT THIS BATHROOM 
NOW I CAN SEE I'M GOING TO DIVIDE A FEW CAMPS HERE BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS 
BLACK AND PINK TILES DONE LIKE THIS IT IS SO NINETEEN THIRTIES BUT IT IS SO FANTASTICALLY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT THIS BATHROOM IS WONDERFUL LOOK AT THIS BATH 
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY FOR THAT ON ONE OF THOSE INTERNET AUCTION SITES 
SURE IT NEEDS CLEANING UP AND EVERYTHING AND THE LOO IT JUST GETS BETTER 
LEAVE THE BATHROOM AS IT IS 
EVERYTHING ELSE WE CAN MESS AROUND WITH BUT DON'T TOUCH THE BATHROOM 
UPSTAIRS WE HAVE THREE GOOD SIZE BEDROOMS 
YOU'VE GOT LIGHT COMING IN THROUGH THE WINDOWS IT NEEDS DECORATING 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT 
I LIKE THIS HOUSE 
I LIKE IT I LIKE IT 
WHAT IS THERE NOT TO LIKE ALL THE BEDROOMS ARE AIRY WITH GOOD SIZE WINDOWS 
THE MASTER BEDROOM BENEFITS FROM AN ATTRACTIVE BAY WINDOW 
AND THERE'S A SINGLE BEDROOM WHICH COULD BE CONVERTED INTO AN OFFICE 
BUT THERE'S ONE DOWNSIDE 
THE MANY GAS FIRES ON VIEW ARE CLUES THAT THERE'S NO CENTRAL HEATING 
SO THAT'S A MAJOR INVESTMENT NEEDED RIGHT THERE 
STILL I THINK THE POSITIVES OUTWEIGH THE NEGATIVES 
TIME TO ASK THE AUCTIONEER SELLING IT WHETHER HE LIKES IT AS MUCH AS I DO 
THIS IS TYPICAL HOUSING STOCK FOR THE AREA NINETEEN THIRTIES BUILT ESTATE 
THE HOUSE WE'VE GOT HERE IS OBVIOUSLY OLD FASHIONED 
IT'S NEVER BEEN ALTERED SINCE IT WAS BUILT 
BY AND LARGE YOUR OCCUPANTS HERE ARE PEOPLE 
WHO'VE BEEN HERE FOR MANY MANY YEARS 
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE PERIOD FEATURES FOUND IN THE HOUSE SO WHAT WOULD IT BE WORTH RENOVATED 
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
IF YOU PUT AN EXTENSION ON WHICH IS PROBABLY GOING TO COST TWENTY THOUSAND TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
YOU'LL PROBABLY ONLY ADD THAT TO THE VALUE OF THE HOUSE 
BUT YOU WILL MAKE IT A MORE DESIRABLE HOUSE FROM A LIVING PERSPECTIVE 
REMEMBER THE GUIDE PRICE IS ONLY NINETY FIVE THOUSAND SO IF THE BUYER CAN GET IT FOR A GOOD PRICE AT THE AUCTION 
THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR PROFIT 
WHAT ABOUT IF THE HOUSE WAS RENTED OUT 
YOU'D BE GETTING SOMETHING IN THE ORDER OF FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE A MONTH 
WELL HERE IS A PROPERTY THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIPE FOR RESTORATION 
NOTHING TO MAJOR TO DO THOUGH 
ALTHOUGH YOU COULD CONSIDER MAYBE BUILDING THAT EXTENSION ON THE BACK THERE 
BUT BEARING IN MIND ALL THE TIME THE CEILING PRICE OF PROPERTIES ROUND HERE 
SO IS IT FINANCIALLY WORTH IT OR NOT 
I WOULD GET RID THE GARAGE 
IT IS ASBESTOS THOUGH SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMEBODY TO DO THAT WHO'S GOING TO TAKE IT ON 
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENED AT THE AUCTION

SOLD AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE NEW OWNERS ARE JOHN AND PAT 
THEY'VE BEEN IN THE PROPERTY INDUSTRY FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AND HAVE TWO SIDES TO THEIR BUSINESS 
ONE IS STRAIGHT DEVELOPMENT AND THE OTHER IS A NOT FOR PROFIT SIDELINE 
SUPPLYING SUITABLE HOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DIFFICULTIES 
IT ALL STARTED BECAUSE WE HAVE A SON WITH A LEARNING DISABILITY 
AND WE WERE TRYING DESPERATELY HARD TO FIND SOMEWHERE WHERE HE COULD LIVE 
AND WE DIDN'T PARTICULARLY LIKE ANY OF THE PLACES WE SAW 
AT THE TIME WE WERE LIVING IN A VERY LARGE VICTORIAN SIX BEDROOMED VILLA 
WE DIDN'T NEED ALL THAT SPACE WE MOVED TO A SMALLER HOUSE DID THE HOUSE UP 
AND NOW OUR SON RENTS IT FROM US WITH THREE OTHER YOUNG GENTLEMEN WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES 
THEIR RENT'S PAID FROM HOUSING BENEFIT AND THERE'S CARERS IN FROM A CARE AGENCY 
WHO GIVE THEM THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE 
BUT THEY'RE LIVING WITHIN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD RATHER THAN IN A LARGE RESIDENTIAL HOME 
SINCE THAT FIRST HOUSE PAT AND JOHN HAVE HOUSED TWELVE PEOPLE ACROSS FIVE PROPERTIES 
AND AS LANDLORDS THEY NOW ENJOY CLOSE TIES WITH THEIR TENANTS 
WE GET TO SEE THEM AND TALK TO PEOPLE IN THEM WE ARE LIKE FRIENDS AREN'T WE 
YES IT'S REALLY NICE 
BETTER THAN A LANDLORD TENANT RELATIONSHIP ONE GIRL WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED 
SHE WAS IN ONE OF OUR HOUSES AND SHE SAID HAVE I GOT A LANDLORD YES 
AND SHE FELT OUT OF IT BECAUSE SHE HADN'T GOT A LANDLORD WHO CAME ROUND TO SEE HER 
CLEARLY JOHN AND PAT ARE MAKING A REAL DIFFERENCE TO PEOPLE'S LIVES 
BUT THIS HOUSE ISN'T DESTINED FOR THEIR SUPPORTED LIVING PORTFOLIO 
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT THE RIGHT CRITERIA 
INSTEAD IT'LL BE USED IN THEIR OTHER BUSINESS PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT 
THEY PLAN TO RENOVATE AND THEN SELL IT ON WHEN FINISHED 
BUYING A HOUSE TO RENOVATE THEN WE'D LOOK AT THE BUYING PRICE 
POTENTIAL SELLING PRICE AND WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO TO IT 
AND THIS ONE FITS THAT CRITERIA VERY WELL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE PLACE WELL 
I WAS QUITE SURPRISED WHEN WE CAME IN 
I THINK THE FIRST SURPRISE WAS THE PIANO 
NOBODY HAS EVER LEFT A PIANO IN A HOUSE BEFORE 
WELL A DISCARDED SET OF IVORIES IS A WELCOME GIFT INDEED SINCE IT CAN EASILY BE RESOLD 
IT'S MY DUTY TO ADVISE JOHN AND PAT ON THE MOST PROFITABLE WAY TO RENOVATE THIS HOUSE 
MY TOP TIP IS TO KEEP THE PINK AND BLACK TILES IN THE BATHROOM 
AND ALSO THE ANTIQUE BATHTUB BOTH OF WHICH ARE TRUE STYLE ICONS 
REVAMP THE BATHROOM BUT LEAVE THE TILES 
YES LEAVE THE PINK AND BLACK TILES 
I LIKE THE PINK AND BLACK TILES YOU CAN HAVE THEM NO YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE THEM 
YOU CAN HAVE THE BATH AS WELL 
NO I'LL DEFINITELY HAVE THE BATH 
TRY A NICE NEW WHITE SUITE THEN BUT LEAVE THE TILES TRY THAT 
NO IT DOESN'T WORK 
NO WE NEED TO TALK TO THE YOUNGSTERS DON'T WE 
WE HAVE THIS POLICY WE ARE GETTING A LITTLE BIT TOO OLD TO DESIGN FOR YOUNGSTERS NOW 
SO WE ASK THE YOUNGSTERS WHAT WOULD YOU DO AND THEN DO WHAT THEY SAY 
AND WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF THEY SAID LEAVE THE TILES IGNORE THEM 
WELL JOHN AND PAT HAVE A BUDGET OF TEN THOUSAND 
AS A FORMER ELECTRICIAN JOHN THINKS THAT THE ELECTRICS ARE O. K. 
SO INSTEAD MONEY WILL BE SPENT ON KNOCKING DOWN THE KITCHEN WALL TO CREATE A KITCHEN DINER 
AND THERE'S A NEW CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEM TO BE PUT IN TOO 
SO WHO DOES THE WORK 
I DO SOME AND WE BRING IN CONTRACTORS WHO WE USE REGULARLY AND PAT DOES SOME 
I DO ALL THE CLEANING 
I GO AROUND CLEANING AFTER ALL THE BUILDERS 
WELL CLEARLY PAT AND JOHN HAVE GREAT COMMUNITY SPIRIT 
WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE PROJECTS THEY TAKE ON 
BUT IN THIS CASE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FINANCIAL RETURNS 
WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF KNOCKING THROUGH THAT WALL IN THE KITCHEN 
NOT BUILDING AN EXTENSION IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT WAY TO GO IF THEY ARE GOING TO MAXIMISE THOSE RETURNS 
THE ONLY CONTENTIOUS POINT IS THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE OUT THOSE TILES 
I WON'T HAVE IT 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS LATER IN THE SHOW 
I'VE COME TO THE CAPITAL 
IT'S VIBRANT HECTIC AND IT CAN BE VERY PRICEY BUT IT NEEDN'T BE 
IF YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH THERE ARE AFFORDABLE PARTS OF LONDON 
THE TRICK IS TO BUY IN AN AREA NEIGHBOURING AN EXPENSIVE ONE BECAUSE THEN 
WHEN THE BUYERS MOVE INTO THE NEXT UP AND COMING AREA YOU ARE ALREADY THERE 
I'M IN THE WEST END OF LONDON TODAY 
NO NOT IN THE HEART OF THEATRE LAND BUT NOT FAR 
I'M ACTUALLY SIX MILES FROM PICCADILLY CIRCUS I'M IN ACTON 
NOW THREE MEMBERS OF THE ROCK BAND THE WHO WERE BORN IN THIS PART OF LONDON 
SO I'M HOPING THE PROPERTY UP FOR SALE ISN'T A SUBSTITUTE FOR SOMETHING BETTER 
THAT IT SUITS MY GENERATION AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A PINBALL WIZARD TO SCORE HIGHLY 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AROUND 
THIS HOUSE IS AT THE END OF THE TERRACE BUT IS CAMOUFLAGED VERY WELL 
THE GUIDE PRICE WAS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SO LET'S FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT WAS ON OFFER 
I'VE GOT TO SAY IT'S A REALLY GOOD START 
THIS IS A SOLIDLY BUILT SUBSTANTIAL VICTORIAN FAMILY HOUSE AND IT'S REALLY WELCOMING 
SOME LOVELY FEATURES UP HERE AND IN THE RECEPTION ROOM IT'S A REALLY BIG SPACE 
YOU'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL VICTORIAN BAY WINDOW AND A RATHER ODD HOME MADE SHELF UNIT IN THE CORNER THERE 
BUT WHAT I LOVE ARE THESE CURVED WALLS YOU GET IN VICTORIAN HOUSES 
I MEAN LOOK AT THAT THAT IS BEAUTIFUL 
YOU'VE GOT A LOVELY BALUSTRADE THE STAIRCASE IS ATTRACTIVE AND A GOOD SIZE SECOND RECEPTION ROOM 
A BIG WINDOW OVER THERE LOADS OF LIGHT COMING IN AND IT'S ALWAYS NICE 
WHEN YOU NOTICE THINGS LIKE THESE REALLY BIG WIDE FLOORBOARDS 
YOU CAN SAVE SO MUCH MONEY BY SANDING THESE DOWN AND IF YOU DO IT RIGHT THEY REALLY CAN COME UP A TREAT 
I THINK THERE IS REAL POTENTIAL HERE TO RESTORE THIS HOUSE INTO A LOVELY FAMILY HOME 
BUT THE FREQUENT PROBLEM WITH OLDER PROPERTIES CROPS UP YET AGAIN 
THE KITCHEN IS FAR TOO SMALL FOR MODERN FAMILIES 
THANKFULLY THE USUAL SOLUTION IS ALSO POSSIBLE 
DO AN EXTENSION AND TURN IT INTO A KITCHEN DINER 
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER THING THE BUYER COULD DO 
THAT IS COMBINE THE KITCHEN SPACE WITH THE NEIGHBOURING DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 
AND MAKE A KITCHEN DINER THAT WAY 
IS THE LAYOUT ANY BETTER UPSTAIRS ON THE FIRST FLOOR 
WHAT'S REALLY EXCITING ME ABOUT THIS HOUSE IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY VICTORIAN FEATURES STILL INTACT 
NOW TAKE A LOOK AT THIS LOVELY DOOR 
IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THIS OFF AND STRIP IT IT REALLY WOULD LOOK SENSATIONAL 
WELL THIS IS THE SMALLEST OF THE THREE BEDROOMS 
AND WHAT REALLY REALLY LETS THIS HOUSE DOWN IS THE MONSTROSITY YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT OUT OF THE WINDOW 
IT'S LIKE A BIG CORRUGATED IRON SHED 
I KNOW FOR ONE I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO WAKE UP AND LOOK AT THAT THING EVERY MORNING 
FORTUNATELY THERE ARE TWO OTHER BEDROOMS AND BOTH ARE AN EXCELLENT SIZE 
THE MAIN BEDROOM IS AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
IT OVERLOOKS THE ROAD AND VERY OVERGROWN FRONT GARDEN 
SO I'VE HAD A GOOD LOOK AROUND THE HOUSE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT 
I ACTUALLY WANT TO SEE WHAT THIS HOUSE LOOKS LIKE 
BUT IT'S SO OVERGROWN WITH BIG OLD BUSHES 
WELL THERE'S A HOUSE UP THE ROAD THAT WOULD GIVE YOU A VERY VERY GOOD IDEA 
I WAS HAVING A LITTLE WALK AROUND TODAY AS I PARKED MY CAR 
AND I CAME ACROSS THIS HOUSE AND THOUGHT THAT IS A NICE HOUSE 
AND THAT HOUSE IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS OUR PROPERTY JUST DOWN THERE 
CLEARLY SOME HOURS WITH A HEDGE TRIMMER WOULD DO WONDERS FOR THIS PROPERTY 
BUT WHAT ABOUT SOME OF MY OTHER RENOVATION IDEAS 
I INVITED A LOCAL AGENT TO CAST HIS EYE OVER HOUSE'S THREE FLOORS 
SO HE CAN TELL ME IF I'M ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE HOUSE ARE 
THAT IT NEEDS MONEY SPENT ON IT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE 
DOWNSTAIRS PARTICULARLY THE FEATURES OF THE PROPERTY INCLUDE A LOT OF THE ORIGINAL COVING 
AND FIREPLACES AND THE ORIGINAL SASH WINDOWS WHICH WILL ADD VALUE TO THE PROPERTY 
THIS HOUSE WENT TO AUCTION GUIDED AT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
ASSUMING THE WORK GETS DONE WHAT PRICE COULD THE HOUSE FETCH 
IF THE WORK WERE DONE TO THIS PROPERTY 
I WOULD WANT TO PUT THIS ON THE MARKET FOR BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
BUT THERE IS YET ANOTHER POSSIBILITY WITH THIS HOUSE 
BECAUSE OF ITS LAYOUT IT COULD CONCEIVABLY BE SPLIT INTO TWO FLATS 
WOULD THAT HELP INCREASE THE RETURN ON THIS PROPERTY 
IF THIS PROPERTY WAS CONVERTED INTO FLATS 
I WOULD PUT THE TWO BEDROOM GARDEN FLAT ON FOR THREE HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
AND THE TWO BEDROOM FLAT UPSTAIRS FOR BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY AND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
HOUSE PRICES HAVE RISEN TWENTY PER CENT IN THE LAST YEAR IN THIS AREA AND SO GROWTH IS HIGH 
AND IT'S CONTINUING TO RISE 
WITH FASHIONABLE EALING AND CHISWICK CLOSE BY THIS HOUSE IS IN A GREAT LOCATION 
BUT IT'S THE LACK OF OUTSIDE SPACE FOR A FAMILY HOME THAT CONCERNS ME 
DON'T FORGET YOU'VE GOT THAT HUGE CORRUGATED EYESORE TO LOOK AT 
SO LET'S FIND OUT WHO DID BUY THE HOUSE WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER 
SO I MOVE ON TO LOT FORTY NINE 
IT IS ONE SPENCER ROAD A GOOD HOUSE LIKE ACTON I DON'T KNOW THREE HUNDRED 
I'M NOT GOING TO GO BELOW THREE HUNDRED 
AT THREE HUNDRED ANYWHERE THREE HUNDRED 
WITH YOU THREE HUNDRED TEN 
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SIR 
THREE HUNDRED FORTY 
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SIR 
THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE 
THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY YEAH 
THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
A NEW SPOT AT THE BACK THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE 
THREE HUNDRED NINETY SIR YOU'RE BIDDING THREE HUNDRED NINETY YES 
THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE AT THE BACK 
FIRST TIME SECOND TIME THIRD 
THREE HUNDRED NINETY SIX IT'S CHEAP STILL THREE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN THREE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT 
THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
FOUR HUNDRED 
FOUR HUNDRED ONE 
FOUR HUNDRED TWO FOUR HUNDRED THREE 
FOUR HUNDRED FOUR 
FOUR HUNDRED FIVE FOUR HUNDRED SIX 
FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT FOUR HUNDRED NINE FOUR HUNDRED TEN 
FOUR HUNDRED ELEVEN 
FOUR HUNDRED TWELVE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTEEN 
FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN SITTING DOWN 
FIRST TIME SECOND TIME THIRD AND LAST TIME IF YOU'RE ALL DONE 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN DIDN'T NEARLY SEE YOU 
FOUR HUNDRED SIXTEEN FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTEEN 
YES FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTEEN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN 
FOUR HUNDRED NINETEEN 
FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY 
FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY ONE 
ONE MORE GO MIGHT BE THEIR LIMIT 
FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SITTING DOWN IN THE AISLE FIRST TIME SECOND TIME THIRD AND LAST TIME ARE WE ALL DONE 
SOLD FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY WELL BID WELL BOUGHT 
THE SUCCESSFUL BID OF FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND WAS MADE BY KAMAL 
HE'S THE OWNER OF TWO GIFT SHOPS IN CENTRAL LONDON AND THIS IS HIS SECOND PROPERTY DEVELOPING PURCHASE 
HE BOUGHT HIS FIRST ONE TWO YEARS AGO 
THE FINAL AUCTION PRICE OF NEARLY HALF A MILLION POUNDS MIGHT SEEM ASTRONOMICAL 
BUT AS IT'S IN LONDON WHERE THE PROPERTY MARKET IS HOT 
THERE MIGHT STILL BE POTENTIAL TO MAKE EVEN MORE MONEY 
KAMAL CONGRATULATIONS 
YOU WERE WITH YOUR WIFE AT THE AUCTION 
YES YOU PAID NINETY FIVE THOUSAND OVER THE GOING PRICE HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE PRICE YOU PAID 
WE WERE A BIT SHOCKED 
WE PAID TWENTY THOUSAND MORE THAN OUR BUDGET BUT WE'LL SEE 
DID YOU GET SLIGHTLY EXCITED 
YES I DIDN'T WANT TO MISS THIS PROPERTY BECAUSE I'VE VIEWED IT THREE TIMES 
SO I DON'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS HOUSE THAT YOU THOUGHT I'VE GOT TO HAVE THAT 
THE PROPERTY I BOUGHT BEFORE IS NEAR THIS PROPERTY I MADE GOOD MONEY ON THAT 
I THOUGHT THIS AREA IS COMING UP 
SO EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE SPENT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND ON THIS HOUSE 
YOU STILL THINK THERE'S ROOM FOR A LOT MORE PROFIT 
I THINK I CAN MAKE IT WORK 
I HAVE A FEW PLANS AND MAYBE I CAN MAKE SOME MONEY 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMPLETELY TOOK ME ABACK WHEN I CAME IN HERE 
WAS THE GREAT BIG CORRUGATED IRON GARAGE YOU'VE GOT IN THE BACKYARD WHAT IS THAT 
IT'S A CAR GARAGE 
WE'RE GOING TO PUT A FENCE BETWEEN OUR GARDEN AND THE GARAGE SO PEOPLE WON'T SEE THAT 
I AM WORRIED THAT HE COULD FIND HIS COSTS RUNNING AWAY WITH HIM 
HE'S ALREADY PAID TWENTY THOUSAND MORE THAN HE PLANNED AND THE REAL EXPENSE IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING 
SO HOW MUCH BUDGET HAVE YOU PUT ASIDE TO DO THE WORK ON HIS PROPERTY 
THIRTY THOUSAND TO FORTY THOUSAND THAT'S QUITE A HEFTY LUMP SUM 
YES I'M GOING TO CHANGE MAYBE ALL THE WINDOWS 
FLOORING CEILING EVERYTHING 
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT SOME PLANS WITH YOU TODAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A FEW IDEAS 
YES WITH WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO 
SHALL WE GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT THEM DOWNSTAIRS YES LUCY COME DOWNSTAIRS 
KAMAL HAD PLANS DRAWN UP TO EXTEND THE KITCHEN AND CONVERT THIS TIRED HOUSE 
INTO ONE VERY SPLENDID PROPERTY 
HERE ARE THE GRAND PLANS SO IS THIS THE FOOTPRINT OF THE PROPERTY 
YES THIS IS FOR THE FAMILY HOUSE 
THIS IS THE FRONT DOOR SO YOU'D COME IN WITH TWO RECEPTION ROOMS HERE 
THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE PLANNING ON PUTTING A KITCHEN AND BATHROOM OUT HERE 
YES WE'RE THINKING OF PUTTING THE KITCHEN HERE BATHROOM ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE 
UPSTAIRS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THREE REALLY NICE SIZED BEDROOMS 
AND UP IN THE LOFT AREA 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER BATHROOM AND BEDROOM 
SO YOU'LL BE SELLING THIS AND MARKETING THIS AS A FAMILY HOUSE 
AND THERE IS OF COURSE A MASSIVE DRAWBACK THAT BEING THAT YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE A GARDEN 
YES I'LL TRY TO MARKET AS A FAMILY HOUSE 
IF I DON'T GET A HIGH PRICE THEN I HAVE ANOTHER OPTION TO CONVERT AS A FLAT 
REALLY YES 
SO YOU'RE THINKING OF APPLYING FOR PLANNING PERMISSION FOR TWO FLATS 
LOOKING AT THE PLANS IT WORKS QUITE WELL AS TWO SEPARATE DWELLINGS 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A GROUND FLOOR FLAT AND A FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR REALLY YES 
BECAUSE THE HOUSE HAS THREE FLOORS IT LENDS ITSELF TO A CONVERSION INTO FLATS QUITE EASILY 
THE ONLY SNAG IS THAT THE SQUARE METRE DIMENSIONS ARE BELOW 
THE COUNCIL'S MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR FLAT CONVERSIONS 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE HE'LL HAVE TO TRY TO PERSUADE HIS COUNCIL 
TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR THIS PROPERTY IN ORDER FOR HIS PLAN TO GO AHEAD 
THIS IS KAMAL'S SECOND ATTEMPT AT PROPERTY DEVELOPING 
I'M WORRIED HE'S TAKEN ON A LOT WITH THIS ONE 
HIS MAIN CONCERN IS FOCUSING ON THE END VALUE OF THE PROPERTY 
WILL HE ACHIEVE THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY OR ABOVE HE'S HOPING FOR 
STAY WITH US TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS LATER ON IN THE SHOW 
THERE'S A COMPLICATED STORY IN CARDIFF LET'S SEE IF I CAN FOLLOW THE PLOT 
RUNNING THAT WAY ALONG THE PLOT 
IN LONDON NEW PROPERTY DEVELOPER KAMAL IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE COUNCIL 
THEY'VE LOST THE PAPERWORK SO I HAVE TO REAPPLY AGAIN 
BUT FIRST WE RETURN TO DERBY WHERE A HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM ARE HAVING PROBLEMS BEING GENEROUS 
WE TRIED TO GIVE THEM AWAY 
WE'RE BACK IN DERBY TO MEET UP WITH JOHN AND PAT 
AN EXPERIENCED PROPERTY DEVELOPING TEAM WHO HAVE JUST BOUGHT THIS DOWN AT HEEL THREE BEDROOMED HOUSE 
AMONGST WHAT WAS LEFT BEHIND WERE A PIANO AND THESE EVER SO COOL BATHROOM TILES 
NOT THAT I COULD PERSUADE JOHN OF THEIR MERIT 
LEAVE THE TILES YES LEAVE THE PINK AND BLACK TILES 
I LIKE THE PINK AND BLACK TILES YOU CAN HAVE THEM YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE THEM 
THE COUPLE HAVE A NOT FOR PROFIT BUSINESS WHICH WORKS ON SUPPORTED LIVING PROJECTS 
THIS WAS FOR THEIR OTHER SIDELINE PROPERTY DEVELOPING 
AND THEY HAVE AN INGENIOUS WAY OF DECORATING THEIR RENOVATED HOUSES 
WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE BIT TOO OLD TO DESIGN FOR YOUNGSTERS 
WE DRAG THE YOUNGSTERS IN AND SAY WHAT WOULD YOU DO 
FOUR MONTHS LATER HOW IS IT LOOKING 
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THE DOUBLE GLAZING SALESMAN 
HAS BEEN KEPT BUSY WITH NEW WINDOWS THROUGHOUT 
THE PEBBLE DASH RENDER HAS BEEN PAINTED TOO 
SO FAR SO GOOD FOR JOHN AND PAT 
ROUND THE BACK THERE'S NO NEW EXTENSION BUT THERE IS SOME PATIO DECKING AND NEW FRENCH DOORS 
BUT THINGS START TO GET A REALLY EXCITING INSIDE 
AS YOU CAN SEE WE'VE TAKEN OUT THE WALL HERE PUT SOME NICE BIG DOORS IN 
SO IT'S MADE THE DOWNSTAIRS SO YOU CAN WALK ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT'S MADE A MUCH BIGGER AREA 
WE'VE BRICKED UP A DOORWAY IN THERE AND GIVEN A BIT OF WALL SPACE ON THIS SIDE 
IN THE KITCHEN WE TOOK THE WHOLE WALL OUT HERE 
THE ORIGINAL KITCHEN WAS QUITE SMALL ALL IT HAD WAS A COOKER A BELFAST SINK AND ONE UNIT 
WE NOW HAVE A FULL RANGE OF KITCHEN UNITS 
IN A CUPBOARD BEHIND ME IS THE GAS BOILER FOR THE CENTRAL HEATING 
THERE WAS NO CENTRAL HEATING BEFORE 
OVERALL WE'RE QUITE PLEASED WITH IT 
IT'S MADE QUITE A NICE JOB 
ONE THING I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THEIR RENOVATION IS THAT THEY'VE GONE FOR SOME VERY MODERN DESIGN FEATURES 
THEY ADMIT THEY ASK THEIR CHILDREN'S OPINIONS ON DECORATION AND THEY'VE REALLY FRESHENED THE PLACE UP 
SINCE YOU WERE LAST HERE WE'VE PUT IN A NEW BATHROOM 
A NEW TOILET DOWNSTAIRS 
WE'VE DONE THE GARDEN TAKEN THE ASBESTOS GARAGE AWAY 
WE HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING RID OF THE ASBESTOS GARAGE 
WE TRIED TWO CONTRACTORS NEITHER TURNED UP AND SOMEBODY RECOMMENDED ANOTHER CONTRACTOR WHO CAME ALONG 
DISMANTLED IT ALL PACKED IT IN PLASTIC BAGS AND TOOK IT AWAY 
IT WAS QUITE AN EXPENSIVE OPERATION GETTING RID OF THE GARAGE COST US OVER FIVE HUNDRED 
IT'S BEEN QUITE A GOOD JOB 
WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS 
I THINK IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE BEST WE'VE EVER DONE REALLY 
IT WAS IN SUCH AN ORIGINAL STATE WHEN WE TOOK THE HOUSE OVER 
AND THEN TO BRING IT UP TO SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY MODERN 
I THINK IT WAS QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT AND I THINK WE'RE QUITE PROUD OF THAT FACT ACTUALLY 
IT WAS QUITE AMAZING REALLY WHEN WE CAME IN AND FOUND ALL THE FURNITURE AND A PIANO 
WE SOLD THE PIANO 
I THINK IT WAS ONE HUNDRED 
ONE HUNDRED FOR THE PIANO NOT BAD 
AND THEY MIGHT HAVE MADE IT EVEN MORE MONEY MY CAREFULLY REMOVING THOSE BEAUTIFUL PINK AND BLACK TILES 
AND SELLING THEM AS THE COLLECTOR'S CLASSICS THAT THEY UNDOUBTEDLY ARE 
ORIGINALLY THE BATHROOM HAD GOT BLACK AND PINK SQUARE TILES 
THEY WERE DATED WE TRIED TO GIVE THEM AWAY NOBODY WANTED THEM 
SO WE FINISHED UP CHOPPING THEM OFF 
WE HAD A CAST BATH IT NEEDED REDOING 
WE COULDN'T GET IT OUT IN ONE PIECE SO WE HAD TO BREAK IT UP AND PUT IN A NEW BATH 
THE BATHROOM IS NOW A LOT BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE 
I BEG TO DISAGREE NOBODY WANTED THOSE PINK AND BLACK TILES WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE PEOPLE OF DERBY 
ANYWAY OUR HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM'S RENOVATION LOOKS GOOD 
THE QUESTION IS HOW HAVE THEY DONE WITH THEIR BUDGET 
WE HAD A BUDGET OF TWENTY THOUSAND AND WE'RE JUST ABOUT DONE SO WE'RE QUITE HAPPY WITH THAT 
THE PROPERTY HAS JOINED THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AT LAST 
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PRICE WHEN WE SHOW IT TO TWO LOCAL AGENTS 
WHEN YOU SEE IT IN ITS RAW STATE 
AND TRY AND VISUALISE WHAT IT'LL BE LIKE 
YOU THINK THIS COULD BE QUITE GOOD THEY'VE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB IT'S ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS 
OVERALL I THINK IT'S QUITE A GOOD JOB 
IT'S MIXED I'M DISAPPOINTED 
IN THE DECORATIVE FINISH 
THESE DAYS THE DECORATIVE FINISH DOES NEED TO BE ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON 
AND THIS ISN'T QUITE SPOT ON 
SO SOME MIXED REACTIONS THERE 
TIME TO FIND OUT HOW THEY AFFECTED THE SELLING PRICE 
JOHN AND PAT BOUGHT THE PROPERTY FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND SPENT ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND RENOVATING IT 
ROUNDED UP THAT'S NEARLY ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
HOW MUCH DO THE AGENTS THINK IT'S WORTH NOW 
IF THIS WENT ON THE MARKET NOW I'D GUESS THE ASKING PRICE WOULD BE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND AND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
I WOULD SUGGEST ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE WOULD BE ABOUT THE RIGHT PRICE 
OBVIOUSLY WE'D LIKE THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY END 
I THINK THE OTHER ONE'S LOW 
IT IS LOW WE KNOW WHAT THE OTHER HOUSES AROUND HERE ARE ON THE MARKET FOR 
AND THAT IS VERY LOW 
SO DEPENDING ON WHICH AGENT YOU TALK TO 
JOHN AND PAT MIGHT HAVE MADE A PROFIT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND OR A LOSS ONCE FEES ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT 
BUT OUR HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM ARE NOT DISHEARTENED 
AND WILL BE HITTING THE AUCTION ROOMS AGAIN SOON 
GO WEST BY PET SHOP BOYS 
I'M IN CARDIFF 
THERE'S THE STATE OF THE ART MILLENNIUM STADIUM 
TRENDY CARDIFF BAY AND EVEN DOCTOR WHO HAS BEEN KNOWN TO TELEPORT IN SOMETIMES 
THIS IS CAERAU 
THE AREA'S PREDOMINANTLY EX LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSING BUT A LOT OF IT'S NOW IN PRIVATE HANDS 
AND IT IS INCREDIBLY POPULAR 
IT'S GOT FANTASTIC TRANSPORT LINKS AND YOU'RE ONLY FOUR MILES TO THE CITY CENTRE 
SO IT WOULD SEEM A PRIME LOCATION 
ANYWHERE SO CLOSE TO THE CITY CENTRE WILL ALWAYS BE POPULAR WITH BOTH BUYERS AND TENANTS ALIKE 
SO WHAT'S UP FOR AUCTION 
WELL IT'S A PLOT OF LAND 
IT'S GOT A GUIDE PRICE OF THIRTY SIX THOUSAND 
THAT'S GOT YOU INTERESTED BUT IT GETS BETTER 
THIS PARTICULAR PLOT OF LAND HAS ALSO GOT PLANNING PERMISSION 
FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A DETACHED THREE BEDROOMED HOUSE 
NOW IT'S GETTING VERY INTERESTING LET'S SEE WHAT'S ON OFFER 
OH GIVE ME LAND LOTS OF LAND 
UNDER STARRY SKIES ABOVE 
LAND WELL AS THEY SAY THEY JUST DON'T MAKE IT ANY MORE 
ITS FINITE QUALITY MAKES IT A GREAT HEDGE AGAINST INFLATION 
AND IN THE LONG TERM WILL NEARLY ALWAYS RISE IN VALUE 
GIVE ME LAND LOTS OF LAND 
UNDER STARRY SKIES 
THIS BIT OF GREEN SPACE MIGHT NOT LOOK MUCH BUT TO A DEVELOPER LAND IS ALWAYS A POTENTIAL GOLDMINE 
I TELL YOU WHAT IT DOESN'T HALF MAKE YOU THINK THIS 
YOU COULD WELL BE STARING AT A PLOT OF LAND THAT YOU OWN PRETTY MUCH LIKE THIS 
THIRTY SIX GRAND THIS COULD GET AT AUCTION 
YOU COULD GET A NICE HOLIDAY WITH THAT ANYWAY WHAT ARE THE PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED 
BASICALLY THEY HAVE GONE FOR A THREE BEDROOMED DETACHED HOUSE 
RUNNING THAT WAY ALONG THE PLOT 
HERE IS THE DESIGNS FOR THE GARAGE COURTYARD KITCHEN DINER 
LIVING ROOM NICE AMOUNT OF SPACE HERE 
AND THEN UPSTAIRS THREE BEDROOMS 
BUT INTERESTING THE DESIGN THEY'VE GONE FOR LOTS OF GLASS 
QUITE AN ARCHITECTURALLY FUNKY FEELING TO IT I'M NOT SURE THAT'S RIGHT FOR THIS AREA 
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT YOU DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY BUILDING SOMETHING 
THAT'S NOT SUITABLE FOR WHERE THE HOUSE IS LOCATED 
ALSO I'M NOT SURE THAT A DETACHED THREE BEDROOM HOUSE 
IS NECESSARILY THE MOST SENSIBLE USE OF THIS PLOT OF LAND 
MAYBE I'D CONSIDER SOMETHING LIKE A FLAT INSTEAD 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT AT LEAST YOU HAVE GOT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED 
THAT'S WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD 
BUT HOW MUCH IS IT REALLY WORTH 
I ASKED A LOCAL AGENT FOR HER THOUGHTS 
THE HOUSING IN THIS AREA IS GENERALLY RENTED ACCOMMODATION 
THERE'S A GREAT LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
FOR FIRST TIME BUYERS FOR YOUNGSTERS 
I THINK WHOEVER BUYS THIS LAND 
SHOULD BE LOOKING TO HEAD DOWN THAT ROAD 
IS THE CURRENT APPROVED PLAN FOR A THREE BEDROOMED HOUSE AND GARAGE THE BEST USE OF THIS PLOT 
HAVING LOOKED AT THE PLANS I'D PREFER TO SEE THE POTENTIAL BUYER 
LOOKING TO SEEK ADVICE WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITY 
TO AMEND THE PLANNING PERMISSION PERHAPS FOR MULTIPLE OCCUPANCY 
ASIDE FROM BEING THE MORE HELPFUL TO THE YOUNGSTERS 
THERE'S ANOTHER REASON WHY FLATS MIGHT BE A BETTER IDEA 
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT A TWO BEDROOMED FLAT APARTMENT HERE 
WOULD REALISE SOMEWHERE AROUND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND TO NINETY THOUSAND 
I THINK WHOEVER BUYS THIS COULD MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY 
BY MAKING THE MULTIPLE OCCUPANCY RESIDENCY 
SO THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF FLATS ON THE PROPERTY 
THE MORE YOUNGSTERS HOUSED AND THE MORE PROFIT FOR THE DEVELOPER 
WE MIGHT HAVE STRUCK SOME WELSH GOLD HERE 
LET'S SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAS SPOTTED IT AS WE HEAD FOR THE AUCTION 
ON NOW TO LOT NUMBER THIRTY EIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
A FREEHOLD BUILDING PLOT WITH FULL PLANNING CONSENT 
FOR A THREE BEDROOMED DETACHED HOUSE AND GARAGE 
FORTY FIVE THOUSAND TO START ME FORTY THEN IF YOU'D LIKE TO GET ON 
THIRTY FIVE THEN START ME 
THIRTY THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF 
THIRTY THANK YOU SIR I SHOULD THINK SO THERE ARE A FEW HANDS NOW 
I'LL TAKE THEM ONE AT A TIME THIRTY FIVE THANK YOU 
FORTY STANDING AT THE BACK 
AT FORTY STANDING AGAINST THE WINDOW IN THE BACK 
SHOUT IF I'M MISSING YOU FORTY ONE THANK YOU 
AT FORTY ONE I THOUGHT YOU'D GOT IT BY THE WINDOW 
THANK YOU AT FORTY TWO 
AT FORTY TWO THOUSAND FORTY THREE THANK YOU 
FORTY FOUR AT FORTY FOUR NO HE SAYS 
I'LL TAKE A HALF THEN IF IT HELPS YOU 
AT FORTY FOUR AND ONE HALF FIVE IF YOU LIKE NOW IN THE BACK 
IS THAT A BID FIVE THANK YOU FORTY FIVE 
AT FORTY FIVE AND ANOTHER HALF PLEASE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND YOU'RE OUT SIR 
NO HE SAYS I THINK HE'S QUITE HAPPY TO BE OUT SHAKING HIS HEAD 
AT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND AT THE BACK 
ARE WE ALL DONE AT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND IN THE BACK 
HE WAITED IN THE SHADOWS BUT NOW HE'S FINALLY NABBED HIS PROPERTY 
HIS NAME IS JOHN AND HE'S A FORMER SENIOR POLICE OFFICER WITH OVER THIRTY YEARS' EXPERIENCE 
MOVING HIS SKILLS INTO PROPERTY DEVELOPING HE NOW OWNS AN ESTATE AGENCY AND TWO PROPERTY COMPANIES 
HE OBVIOUSLY LIKES THE AREA BECAUSE HE OWNS ANOTHER BUILDING PLOT 
TWO HUNDRED M. DOWN THE ROAD ON WHICH WAIT FOR I. T. THIRTY HOUSES WILL BE BUILT 
JOHN LOVELY TO MEET YOU NICE TO MEET YOU CONGRATULATIONS 
THANK YOU WHY DID YOU WANT TO BUY THIS PLOT 
I SAW IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EITHER BUILD WHAT HAS BEEN INTENDED TO BUILD ON HERE 
OR PERHAPS CHANGE IT TO WHAT I HOPE TO EVENTUALLY BUILD THREE APARTMENTS THREE FLATS 
O. K. GOING DOWN A DIFFERENT I DIDN'T LIKE THE DESIGN OF WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH 
IT WASN'T SUITABLE FOR THE AREA REALLY IT WOULDN'T FIT 
I THINK FLATS ARE GOING TO BE MORE SUITABLE FOR THIS AREA 
AND THERE ARE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE IN THIS AREA 
THESE ARE GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR PEOPLE 
IN TERMS OF YOUR PROFITS BECAUSE THAT MUST COME INTO IT SOMEWHERE 
ABSOLUTELY IS IT MORE PROFITABLE TO GO DOWN THE FLAT ROUTE 
HOW DID YOU GO ABOUT SETTING YOUR LIMIT FOR WHAT YOU'D PAY FOR THIS 
WELL WE KNOW WHAT THE PRICES ARE IN THE AREA 
THE THREE BEDROOM HOUSE THAT IS ALREADY PLANNED FOR THIS PLOT 
WOULD PROBABLY ACHIEVE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND 
THERE WOULD BE SOME PROFIT IN THAT BUT NOT A GREAT DEAL 
IF I GO DOWN THE ROUTE I'M HOPING TO OF THREE FLATS THEN THERE WILL BE GREATER PROFIT 
BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE A MUCH BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE 
TO MAYBE GET ON THE LADDER AND OWN THEIR OWN PROPERTY 
JOHN'S DESIRE TO HELP THE YOUNG ISN'T LIMITED TO THE FUTURE BUYERS OF HIS PROPOSED FLATS 
IN FACT ONE LUCKY RECIPIENT IS MUCH CLOSER TO HOME 
I SAW THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE MY SON 
INTO THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE OF THINGS 
HE CURRENTLY WORKS FOR ME BUT NOT ON DEVELOPMENTS 
SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO GET INVOLVED 
AND SEE HOW IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO BECOME A DEVELOPER 
TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD SON RHODRI IS GOING TO SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES 
OF DEVELOPING THIS SITE WITH JOHN 
HE ALREADY WORKS IN THE FAMILY ESTATE AGENCY BUSINESS BUT THIS WILL BE A BIG STEP UP 
THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND 
THIS LAND IS MY LAND 
THIS LAND WAS MADE FOR YOU AND ME 
ROD THIS IS ALL A BIT EXCITING THEN 
IT IS YEAH VERY MUCH SO YEAH 
WHAT DID YOU SAY WHEN YOUR DAD SAID HE WANTED YOU TO GET INVOLVED 
I'VE BEEN PESTERING FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS 
THAT I WAS INTENDING ON BRANCHING OUT AND STARTING WITH MY FIRST DEVELOPMENT 
AND I'VE BEEN WATCHING MY DAD DO IT FOR YEARS NOW 
AND OBVIOUSLY WORKING AS AN ESTATE AGENT I DEAL WITH A LOT OF DEVELOPERS 
AND I WAS GETTING A BIT TIRED OF SEEING EVERYONE ELSE MAKING THEIR MONEY 
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT TIME I TRIED 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS AS A PROJECT TO TAKE ON I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT YEAH 
EVEN IF THE PLANS DON'T EVENTUALLY COME THROUGH FOR THE THREE APARTMENTS 
IT'LL STILL BE A DEVELOPMENT THAT'LL BE A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR ME TO LEARN THE ROPES REALLY 
AND TO GET MYSELF UP TO SPEED WITH THE WAY THAT IT WORKS START TO FINISH 
BUT HOPEFULLY IF WE DO COME THROUGH WITH THE PLANS THEN YEAH 
IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT ONE TO START WITH 
SO HOW IS IT GOING TO WORK ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS 
ARE YOU GOING TO BE PROJECT MANAGING ARE YOU GOING TO BE FINDING BUILDERS ETC OR WHAT 
I'LL PROBABLY LARGELY HAND IT OVER TO MY DAD FOR THE GENERAL RUNNING BECAUSE THAT'S HIS PROFESSION 
AND I'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT A DAY JOB THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RUN SIDE BY SIDE 
I'LL SPEND A FAIR BIT OF TIME BACK AND FORTH CHECKING PROGRESS 
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S COMING ON AND RATHER THAN BEING HERE CRACKING THE WHIP 
I'LL JUST BE TAKING A SLIGHTLY BACKSTAGE ROLE AND JUST WATCHING IT PROGRESS FROM START TO FINISH 
THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH ANY PROFIT 
WHO GETS TO KEEP THAT YEAH IT'S A BIT OF A STICKING POINT 
BUT HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE LOOKING TO REINVEST IN SOMETHING PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHT AWAY 
I'M SURE THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE TAKING A SMALL BIT OUT AT THE END 
BUT WE'LL BE LOOKING TO STICK MOST OF IT BACK INTO SOMETHING ELSE STRAIGHT AWAY YEAH 
TALKING ABOUT PROFIT IT'S TIME TO ASK DAD JOHN HOW MUCH HE'S HOPING TO MAKE FROM THE SMALL SITE 
TOTAL COST OF THE FLATS I WOULD ESTIMATE AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT THEY MIGHT SELL FOR 
YEAH A TWO BEDROOMED FLAT HERE SHOULD EASILY ACHIEVE ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND PLUS 
VERY AFFORDABLE AND THE ONE BEDROOM FLAT I'D SAY PROBABLY ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
SO WITH DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR TWO TWO BEDROOMED FLATS AND ONE ONE BEDROOM FLAT 
HOW MUCH PROFIT WILL THERE BE FOR THE FATHER AND SON TEAM 
THERE SHOULD BE A PROFIT OF ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND OR SIXTY THOUSAND 
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T GET THE PLANNING PERMISSION FOR YOUR FLATS 
I JUST GO BACK TO PLAN A AND BUILD A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE 
IT'LL BE PROFITABLE BUT NOT AS PROFITABLE AS THE FLATS 
GIVE ME AN IDEA OF THE TIMESCALES FOR WHAT YOU ARE PLANNING 
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE'LL BE INTO THE GROUND WITHIN ABOUT TWO TO THREE MONTHS FROM NOW 
RIGHT SO WE'LL COME BACK IN A FEW MONTHS' TIME HOPEFULLY YOU'LL HAVE BROKEN GROUND 
I HOPE TO SEE A BUILDING GOING UP FAST 
ME TOO CONGRATULATIONS WITH THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARTIN I HOPE YOU HAVE SUCCESS 
THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND 
THIS LAND IS MY LAND 
THIS LAND WAS MADE FOR YOU AND ME 
IF THEY CAN GET THOSE PLANS THROUGH FOR THOSE THREE FLATS 
I RECKON THEY'RE ON TO A WINNER BUT OF COURSE WITH PLANNING YOU NEVER KNOW 
WILL THEY HAVE TO RESORT TO THE ORIGINAL PLANS FOR THAT THREE BEDROOMED PROPERTY 
YOU CAN FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW 
NOW TIME AND TIDE WAIT FOR NO MAN 
AND IN THE PROPERTY WORLD TIME USUALLY MEANS MONEY 
IT'S THE POINT WHERE WE GO BACK AND FIND OUT IF THE TIME AND THE EFFORT HAVE BEEN WELL SPENT 
HIDDEN AWAY BEHIND THE BUSHES THIS END OF TERRACE PROPERTY IN ACTON 
WEST LONDON WAS BOUGHT AT AUCTION FOR FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND BY KAMAL 
HE WAS PLANNING TO CONVERT THE HOUSE INTO TWO SEPARATE FLATS 
WE'VE COME BACK FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS LATER AND AT LEAST YOU CAN NOW SEE THE HOUSE FROM THE ROAD 
INSIDE KAMAL'S BUILDERS HAVE REALLY GOT STUCK IN 
WALLS HAVE COME DOWN AND CHARACTER FEATURES HAVE BEEN RIPPED OUT 
AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE A NEW EXTENSION HAS BEEN BUILT 
AND UPSTAIRS THE BEDROOM AND BATHROOM HAVE BOTH CHANGED SO THE PROPERTY IS UNRECOGNISABLE 
UP IN THE ATTIC THANKS TO A LOFT CONVERSION THERE'S NOW A NEW BEDROOM WITH AN EN SUITE 
SO FAR ALL THE MAJOR WORK'S DONE ON THE PROPERTY 
ONLY FLOORING NEEDS TO BE DONE AND ALL THE SMALL DECORATION WORK 
AND CONVERTING TO TWO FLATS 
THE HOUSE HADN'T BEEN TOUCHED FOR YEARS SO IT REQUIRED A MAJOR REFURBISHMENT 
BASICALLY ON THE PROPERTY WE HAVE DONE THE REWIRING PLASTERING 
PUT IN NEW WINDOWS MOST OF THE WORK MAJOR WORKS ARE DONE 
KAMAL DECIDED TO TAKE A RISK 
HE STARTED TO DO SOME OF THE PREPARATION WORK FOR THE TWO FLATS IN THE HALLWAY 
HE WE ARE IN THE COMMUNAL AREA 
THIS IS THE MAIN DOOR FOR THE FIRST FLOOR FLAT 
THIS IS THE MAIN DOOR FOR THE GROUND FLOOR FLAT 
THIS IS GOING TO BE BLOCKED OFF SO PEOPLE HAVE TO WALK THROUGH THIS 
THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE HERE SO WHEN WE GET THE PLANNING PERMISSION 
IT WILL BE NICE SPACIOUS TWO FLATS 
CONVERTING THE LOFT AND PUTTING THE REAR EXTENSION ON DIDN'T NEED PLANNING PERMISSION 
AS THEY FELL WITHIN THE PROPERTY'S PERMITTED DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS 
BUT THE CONVERSION TO TWO FLATS DOES REQUIRE PERMISSION AND THAT'S DRAGGING ON 
YES IT'S TAKING PLANNING LONGER THAN I THOUGHT 
BECAUSE FIRST I HAVE APPLIED FOR IT AND THEY'VE LOST THE PAPERWORK 
SO I HAVE TO REAPPLY AGAIN SO IT'S TAKING A ONE MONTH DELAY 
WHEN THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT REJECTED KAMAL'S INITIAL PROPOSAL 
THE WORK ON HIS FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND INVESTMENT HAD TO STOP 
I WAS PLANNING TO START SOME OF THE WORK AND COMPLETE BEFORE I HAD THE PLANNING PERMISSION 
BUT I HAD A VISIT BY A PLANNING OFFICER 
I'VE BEEN TOLD NOT TO DO ANY MORE WORK REGARDING CONVERTING THE FLAT SO I HAVE TO STOP 
SINCE THEN WE ARE DOING WORK OUTSIDE 
WE'VE DONE LOTS OF WORK ON THE FRONT 
BECAUSE IT HAD A BIG LARGE TREE ON THE FRONT WE HAD TO CHOP DOWN 
THE REAR OF THE HOUSE OVERLOOKS THE INDUSTRIAL BUILDING 
NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE BUT KAMAL RECKONS THAT HE'S DISGUISED IT 
THE GARAGE WE MANAGED TO PUT A BIG FENCE TO COVER IT 
SO PEOPLE CAN'T SEE THE GARAGE AT THE BACK 
IT'LL ONLY BE A SMALL GARDEN BUT IT'S GOING TO BE NICE 
THE FENCE DOES BLOCK THE VIEW OF THE GARAGE 
BUT WITH KAMAL'S NEW EXTENSION THERE'S NEXT TO NO GARDEN LEFT 
BIT BY BIT ITS POTENTIAL AS A FAMILY HOUSE IS STARTING TO DIMINISH 
SO INCREASINGLY KAMAL IS PINNING HIS HOPES ON GETTING THE GO AHEAD 
TO CONVERT THE HOUSE INTO TWO FLATS 
KAMAL PAID FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND AT THE AUCTION 
AND RECKONS THAT THE DELAY IN OBTAINING PLANNING PERMISSION 
HAS COST HIM ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND IN EXTRA MORTGAGE REPAYMENTS 
AND BUILDING COSTS SO HOW HAS HIS BUDGET FARED 
I'VE SPENT ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND ON THE PROPERTY SO FAR 
I'M LOOKING TO SPEND ANOTHER FIFTEEN THOUSAND TO COMPLETE 
THERE'S A NAGGING DOUBT THAT THE PLANNING PERMISSION MIGHT NOT BE GRANTED ON APPEAL 
SO IF HE DOESN'T GET IT WHAT WILL KAMAL DO NEXT 
IF WE DON'T GET THE PLANNING PERMISSION IT'LL BE A WHOLE HOUSE 
IT'LL BE FOUR BEDROOMED TWO BATHROOM 
IT WILL BE ONE BIG HOUSE 
WHEN I FINISH THIS PROPERTY I'LL DEFINITELY BE SELLING 
WILL THERE BE MUCH DEMAND FOR THE PROPERTY WHEN IT'S FINISHED 
TIME TO ASK TWO LOCAL PROPERTY EXPERTS 
IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT EASIER TO SELL AS TWO FLATS THAN ONE HOUSE 
HOUSES IN THIS AREA SELL VERY WELL 
HIGHLY IN DEMAND BECAUSE OF THEIR PERIOD CHARACTER 
AND THE GARDENS ARE GENERALLY OF A GOOD SIZE 
THE GARDEN IS VERY SMALL AND THAT'S GOING TO BE AN ISSUE 
I THINK HE'S GOING TO STRUGGLE TO CONVERT THE HOUSE INTO TWO FLATS 
IT'S TOO SMALL I THINK EALING COUNCIL ARE GOING TO BE VERY TIGHT ON GIVING HIM PLANNING PERMISSION 
IT'S IN LIMBO AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
YOU CAN SEE WITH THE LAYOUT THAT IT'S HALF A HOUSE AND HALF FLATS 
ONE OF THE EALING'S CRITERIA IS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SQUARE METRES 
WITH THIS BEING AN END OF TERRACE VICTORIAN PROPERTY GENERALLY 
THEY'RE ABOUT EIGHTY SQUARE METRES SO I DO THINK HE'LL STRUGGLE 
ASSUMING THE HOUSE IS CONVERTED INTO TWO FLATS AS KAMAL WANTS HOW MUCH COULD EACH ONE OF THEM SELL FOR 
I THINK IF HE'S PUTTING THE GROUND FLOOR FLAT ON THE MARKET I WOULD PUT IT ON AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND 
WITH REGARDS TO THE FIRST FLOOR FLAT IT'S A MUCH BETTER SIZE 
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY GARDEN BUT I THINK THAT SHOULD BE GOING ON AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
THE VALUE OF THE GROUND FLOOR FLAT HERE IS PROBABLY WORTH IN THE REGION OF AROUND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE 
AND I THINK THE TOP FLOOR FLAT NICE BIG MAISONETTE UPSTAIRS PROBABLY WORTH SOMEWHERE UP TO THREE HUNDRED 
THAT'S QUITE GOOD ACTUALLY 
SIMILAR FIGURE THAT I HAD IN MY MIND AS WELL 
SO I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THAT 
EVEN AFTER A RENOVATION BUDGET OF FIFTY THOUSAND AND A PURCHASE PRICE OF FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
KAMAL COULD STILL BE MAKING A PROFIT OF AROUND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
IF HE SOLD BOTH FLATS 
THIS IS WHY HE HAS PERSISTED SO LONG WITH THE PLANNING APPLICATION 
BUT AS KAMAL KNOWS IT IS A RISKY DECISION BECAUSE IF HE FAILS 
HIS NEXT PLAN IS TO SELL THE NEWLY MODIFIED HOUSE AS A FAMILY HOME 
WHAT WOULD THAT MAKE 
IF I WAS TO TAKE THIS PROPERTY ON AS A FOUR BEDROOMED HOUSE 
I WOULD PUT IT ON THE MARKET AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
AS A SINGLE FOUR BEDROOMED HOUSE IN THIS LOCATION I WOULD SAY YOU ARE LOOKING BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
OH DEAR 
IF KAMAL DOESN'T CLEAR FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND FOR THIS HOUSE HE IS OUT OF POCKET 
IF I DON'T GET THE PLANNING PERMISSION I MIGHT NOT GET A GOOD PRICE FOR IT 
I UNDERSTAND THAT 
I WILL WAIT AND SEE WHETHER I WILL GET PLANNING PERMISSION OR NOT 
IT IS ALL DEPENDING ON THAT 
AFTER WE FILMED THE COUNCIL FINALLY DECIDED NOT TO GRANT PERMISSION FOR THE TWO FLATS 
KAMAL HAS NOW APPEALED AGAINST THAT DECISION BUT IN THE MEANTIME 
HE IS PLANNING TO RENT OUT THE HOUSE 
IT'S TIME TO REVISIT FATHER AND SON TEAM JOHN AND RHODRI 
WHO BOUGHT THIS PIECE OF BUILDING LAND IN CAERAU AN AREA CLOSE TO CARDIFF CITY CENTRE 
THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND 
THIS LAND IS MY LAND 
THIS LAND WAS MADE FOR YOU AND ME 
JOHN IS AN EXPERIENCED PROPERTY DEVELOPER WHO OWNS A BUILDING FIRM AND ESTATE AGENCY 
THE LATTER PARTLY RUN BY HIS TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD SON 
THE BOYS HAVE SCRAPPED THE APPROVED PLANS 
AND GONE FOR THE AMBITIOUS APPROACH OF PUTTING THREE FLATS ON THE SMALL SITE 
WE'RE BACK EIGHT MONTHS LATER TO SEE HOW THEY'VE GOT ON 
AH NOTHING ON THE SITE HAD CHANGED YET BY THIS STAGE 
JOHN HAD PREDICTED THAT FRESHLY BUILT WALLS WOULD HAVE BEEN ON SHOW 
IN FACT THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS HAD A MAKEOVER IS OUR FATHER AND SON TEAM 
SO WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY THE DELAY 
OUR SCHEME WITH THE PLANS ORIGINALLY 
WAS THAT THERE WERE TWO TWO BEDROOMED FLATS AND ONE SMALL ONE BEDROOMED FLAT 
THE PLANNERS HAD DECIDED THERE WAS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE 
ENOUGH AMENITY SPACE AND ALLOCATED PARKING FOR THE THREE 
THE ADDITIONAL CAR PARKING SPACE AND BIN STORAGE SPACE AND CYCLE STORAGE SPACE THAT IS REQUIRED THESE DAYS 
THEY CAME BACK AND ADVISED THAT BECAUSE OF THAT 
EVEN THOUGH THERE HAD BEEN NO OBJECTIONS FROM LOCAL RESIDENTS 
THEY THOUGHT THAT TWO BED WAS GOING TO BE A MORE APPROPRIATE OPTION FOR US 
WE HAVE CUT THAT OFF THE PLANS AND JUST LEFT THE TWO TWO BEDROOM FLATS ONE OF TOP OF THE OTHER 
WHERE THE ONE BEDROOMED FLAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
THERE WILL BE A NICE PRIVATE COURTYARD AMENITY SPACE FOR THE OCCUPANTS 
THE PLANS WE'VE HAD PASSED HERE ARE FOR TWO SELF CONTAINED TWO DOUBLE BEDROOM MAISONETTES 
THEY SHOULD BE GOOD UNITS FOR EITHER A COUPLE OR A YOUNG COUPLE WITH MAYBE ONE CHILD 
IT HAS NOT BEEN THE SORT OF INTRODUCTION TO PROPERTY DEVELOPING 
THAT JOHN WOULD HAVE WISHED UPON HIS SON BUT THE DELAYS ARE ALL PART OF A BUILDER'S LIFE 
THERE IS SOME FRUSTRATION IN NEARLY ALL PLANNING APPLICATIONS THESE DAYS 
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU HEAR OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES COMING OUT 
THAT THERE IS A HUGE DEMAND FOR BROWNFIELD SITES TO BE DEVELOPED 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES DO TAKE THEIR TIME UNFORTUNATELY 
WE'VE BEEN CONSTANTLY WAITING FOR THE LOCAL AUTHORITY 
AND THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT TO COME BACK AND GIVE US AN ANSWER EITHER WAY 
FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS TO COME BACK AND SAY THAT WAS AN OVER DEVELOPMENT 
WHICH I CONSIDER TO BE A VERY LONG TIME 
IT HAS BEEN QUITE FRUSTRATING 
WE ARE NOW HOPEFULLY COMING TO THE TIME WHEN WE WILL START BUILDING ON THE SITE 
EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN HELD UP 
AS JOHN IS AN EXPERIENCED PROPERTY DEVELOPER 
HE HAS USED THE TIME FRUITFULLY 
THIS IS WHERE THE BUILDING LINE IS GOING TO BE 
THIS WILL BE THE END OF THE BUILDING 
THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING WILL FACE THE ROAD THERE 
THE BACK OF THE BUILDING WILL ABUT THE HOUSE THAT I HAVE JUST BOUGHT HERE 
WHICH WILL BE USED AND WILL BE VERY USEFUL TO US 
TO BE ABLE TO TAP INTO THE SERVICES AND USE WHILE WE COMMENCE THE BUILDING WORK 
HOLD ON DID I HEAR HIM SAY HOUSE 
YES THE FATHER AND SON TEAM BOUGHT THIS ONE ON THE CORNER AND PLAN TO RENT IT OUT 
ONCE THE BUILDING IS COMPLETED THE NEW TENANTS 
WILL BE TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS TO THE NOISE AND DUST THAT WAS THERE BEFORE SO EVERYBODY WINS 
SEEING HIS FATHER USE HIS KNOW HOW 
HAS BEEN ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE JOB SO FAR FOR SON RHODRI 
MY DAD IS A GREAT MENTOR AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE COME UNSTUCK ON 
I KNOW I HAVE MY DAD TO FALL BACK ON 
TYPICALLY OF ALL KIDS THEY THINK THEY KNOW IT ALL 
THEY TRY AND RUN BEFORE THEY WALK 
HE HAS BEEN A PRETTY GOOD PUPIL SO FAR 
LOOKING AHEAD TO THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION HOW MUCH DOES THIS FATHER AND SON TEAM HOPE TO MAKE 
THE COST OF BUILDING THE TWO FLATS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND 
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL GROUND WORK 
AND SOME WALLS AND LANDSCAPING ANOTHER PERHAPS FIVE THOUSAND 
TOGETHER WITH THE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT IT COST TO BUY THE PLOT INITIALLY 
THAT IS ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
I WOULD HOPE TO GET A RETURN OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
JOHN AND RHODRI HOPE TO SELL THE TWO FLATS FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND EACH 
ENSURING A PROFIT OF AROUND SEVENTY THOUSAND 
WILL THEY ACHIEVE IT TIME TO ASK A LOCAL AGENT 
HOW MUCH DOES HE THINK THE PROPOSED FLATS WILL EACH BE WORTH 
WHEN THESE FLATS ARE BUILT 
I WOULD EXPECT TO ACHIEVE A PRICE OF NINETY THOUSAND EACH 
THE FIGURE IS LOWER THAN WHAT JOHN AND RHODRI HAD EXPECTED 
PROVIDING THEM WITH ONLY A FIFTY THOUSAND PROFIT 
I WOULD THINK THAT IS A LOW FIGURE VERY CONSERVATIVE 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A MORE REALISTIC FIGURE BEING AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
I AGREE WE'VE BEEN APPROACHED BY A LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY 
AND THEY'VE ALREADY MADE US A TENTATIVE OFFER 
OF OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR EACH PROPERTY 
SO I WOULD THINK IT WAS A LITTLE BIT LOW 
WITH A GOOD OFFER POTENTIALLY ON THE TABLE 
IT SEEMS THAT OUR FATHER AND SON TEAM ARE OFF TO A FLYING START 
WE HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED SEEING TODAY'S PROPERTY PORTFOLIO 
MAKE SURE YOU JOIN US NEXT TIME FOR MORE HOMES UNDER THE HAMMER SEE YOU THEN
