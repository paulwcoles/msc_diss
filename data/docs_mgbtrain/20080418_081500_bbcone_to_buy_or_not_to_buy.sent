HELLO AND WELCOME TO TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY WE'RE IN WORCESTERSHIRE 
TO COME TO THE RESCUE OF A COUPLE WHO ARE DOWNSIZING 
EVESHAM IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE FRUIT BASKET OF ENGLAND 
AND WE HAVE A SITUATION RIPE FOR OUR EXPERTISE 
IN THE LOCATION FAMOUS FOR PRODUCING ASPARAGUS TIPS 
WE'LL BE PROVIDING OUR OWN TIPS WITH THREE PROPERTIES TO VIEW 
THEN THEY PICK THEIR FAVOURITE AND TRY BEFORE THEY BUY 
RETIRED COUPLE BILL AND MOIRA BAILEY HAVE LIVED IN SUTTON COLDFIELD FOR MOST OF THEIR LIVES 
BILL WAS A DENTIST AND MOIRA A RADIOGRAPHER 
THEY'VE SOLD THEIR PROPERTY AND ARE LIVING AT BILL'S MOTHER'S HOME 
WITH ALL BUT ONE OF THEIR FOUR CHILDREN HAVING FLOWN THE NEST THEY'RE DOWNSIZING 
SO WE'RE GETTING MORE ACQUAINTED 
I THINK WE'RE ABOUT TO GO ON A BIT OF A JOURNEY TOGETHER YES 
HOPE SO BECAUSE YOU'VE SOLD UP YOU'RE NEEDING A NEW HOME WHAT IS IT WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
WE'D LIKE A MINIMUM OF THREE BEDROOMS BUT BIG BEDROOMS O. K. 
LESS HOUSE TO CLEAN AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT MORE ROOM AROUND ALL RIGHT 
LESS HOUSE MORE SPACE YES SORRY YOU'LL HAVE TO CLARIFY FOR ME 
YOU O. K. I'M SLIGHTLY CONFUSED 
SINCE I'VE RETIRED I'VE ACCUMULATED SOME HOBBIES THAT TAKE SPACE 
I'D LIKE A SMALLER HOUSE WITH LESS WORK TO DO IN THE HOUSE 
PERHAPS A GARDEN NEEDING LESS WORK BUT WITH SPACE FOR MY HOBBIES 
HOBBIES BEING I'VE GOT TWO OLD CARS THAT I ENJOY POTTERING WITH 
ANYTHING ELSE WITHIN THE HOUSE A LARGE KITCHEN AHA O. K. 
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE FRIENDS AROUND HOPEFULLY IF WE LIVE IN THE COUNTRY THEY'LL STILL COME 
IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH ARM MOVEMENT PULLING THE CORK OUT OF THE BOTTLE TAKES SO YOU NEED SPACE 
A LARGE KITCHEN YES ON LOCATION WHERE ARE WE LOOKING 
FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR FROM BIRMINGHAM IS GREAT 
I'D PREFER THE SOUTH SIDE OF IT 
SO STAYING NEAR THE MIDLANDS BUT BEING WITHIN COMMUTING DISTANCE WITH FRIENDS IN SUTTON COLDFIELD 
WE'VE GOT FAMILY HERE AS WELL NOW WE'RE GETTING SOME FOCUS HERE 
TOME NOW FOR THE BIG UGLY VULGAR QUESTION WHICH I'LL ASK WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET

WE NOW HAVE OUR THREE PROPERTIES TIME NOW TO COMMENCE THE VIEWINGS AT PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
PROPERTY ONE IS A FOUR BEDROOM HOME IN THE HAMLET OF WYRE PIDDLE 
JUST SIX MILES FROM EVESHAM

O. K. MOIRA BILL PROPERTY ONE IS MY CHOICE IT IS IN THE DELIGHTFULLY NAMED VILLAGE OF WYRE PIDDLE 
WE ARE LESS THAN AN HOUR FROM BIRMINGHAM JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM WHERE YOU ARE AT THE MOMENT 
O. K. IT'S NOT QUITE DOOMSDAY IT IS MODERN DAY BUT IT IS A LOVELY PROPERTY 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS NICE AND GREEN I LIKE THAT 
SMALLER THAN I EXPECTED SMALLER GARDEN LOOKS CAN BE DECEPTIVE 
YOU ARE DOWNSIZING JUST TO THROW THAT BACK AT YOU 
ABSOLUTELY IT'S HARD MENTALLY I APPRECIATE THAT QUITE HAPPY 
YES LOOKS PROMISING CAN WE LOOK 
HAVE A LOOK ROUND SEE IF IT FEELS LOVELY BE EMBRACED 
WHAT DID YOU MEAN YOU DID LISTEN HE HASN'T FOUND THE OTHER BIT 
I THOUGHT OF BILL AND DID LISTEN HE'S GOT A POINT 
WHAT WILL MOIRA AND FORMER DENTIST BILL THINK OF MY CHOICE 
LOOK ROOM FOR A TABLE THERE'S BEAMS YEAH 
SORT OF OLDE WORLDE FEEL 
HOW BIZARRE IS THAT LIKE IT'S FROM THE REIGN OF HENRY THE EIGHTH 
WHEN IT'S BASICALLY A BABY 
THE LOUNGE MORE BEAMS YES 
A GOOD SIZED ROOM A BIT DARK 
IT DOES FEEL A LITTLE BIT DARK BUT THAT'S TO DO WITH THE DECOR 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE INTERESTING FIREPLACE 
SAY AH AH 
AAH AAH 
THIS IS THE DINING ROOM 
I WANTED HIM TO MAKE THAT NOISE IN THE LOUNGE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN 
MORE BEAMS INTERESTING COLOUR YEAH IT'S QUITE A GOOD SIZE THOUGH 
I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BECOMING QUITE POSITIVE 
THE KITCHEN BIGGER INSIDE THAN IT LOOKS IT IS YES 
THIS SHOULD SUIT YOU 
THIS HOUSE IS LIKE PAMELA ANDERSON HOW QUITE WELL PROPORTIONED 
THE WHOLE THING IS A LITTLE BIT DARK FOR ME A COTTAGEY FEEL 
I LIKE A SLIGHTLY AIRY LOOK BUT THAT'S A MATTER OF DECOR 
I THOUGHT MOIRA WOULD COMMENT MORE ON THE DECOR BUT NOT REALLY 
POSSIBLY BECAUSE SHE WAS A RADIOGRAPHER SHE SEES THROUGH SUCH DETAIL YOU'RE FIRED 
OH UTILITY WHERE I SPEND ALL MY LIFE IRONING AND WASHING 
UTILITY SPACES CAN BE A LITTLE UTILITARIAN HERE THEY ARE QUITE DECADENT DO YOU NOT THINK 
QUITE EXTRAVAGANT SHUT UP 
THE GARAGE 
YEAH THERE'S GOOD STORAGE SPACE UP THERE I CAN DO SOMETHING WITH THAT 
THIS IS NOT OVERLY LARGE IS IT FOR YOUR BITS AND BOBS 
WELL IT'S BIG ENOUGH IF THERE'S NOT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS IN IT AS WELL 
HIM BEING A DENTIST HE SAID IF WE FIND THE RIGHT PROPERTY HE'LL REWARD US WITH A PLAQUE 
YOU'RE JUST FILLING TIME NOW 
TRY THIS ONE 
THAT'S A GOOD SIZE I WONDER IF IT'S NUMBER ONE TWO THREE OR FOUR 
YES BUILT IN WARDROBES 
DON'T GET EXCITED BUT LARGE CHESTS AND BIG DRAWERS IN A HOUSE SPOT ON ABSOLUTELY 
BATHROOM YEAH 
HAS IT GOT A SHOWER AS WELL 
I WONDER IF THIS IS THE ONLY BATHROOM I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING NEXT THIS WOULD BE THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
BRUSH THE HOUSE TWICE A DAY AND IT WILL STAY CLEAN AND HEALTHY FOREVER 
THIS IS A BIGGER ROOM MOIRA OH YES THIS IS MORE THE SIZE THAT I'D BE INTERESTED IN 
OVERLOOKS THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
RIGHT BEDROOM NUMBER TWO SLIGHTLY LARGER YES 
AH THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
OH I LIKE THIS ONE THERE'S AN EN SUITE YES 
AND AIR CONDITIONING TOO 
THAT MIGHT JUST BE AN ESTATE AGENT 
LET'S SEE WHO IT IS YOUR DENTIST HELLO 
THIS IS A BIT MORE LIKE IT ALL THESE ROOMS WOULD BE LIGHTER 
THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW IT'S ALL GOING WELL 
IF IT'S A SUCCESS I'LL CALL BACK 
AND AN EN SUITE MORE FITTED WARDROBES YEA H. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
YOU CAN'T CONTROL THESE ESTATE AGENTS THESE DAYS 
THAT'S THE ERA ISN'T IT 
THE ARCHITECTS REALLY TRIED TO GET AS MUCH OUT OF THE INTERIOR SPACE AS POSSIBLE YES 
RIGHT LET'S GO AND EXTRACT THEIR OVERALL OPINION SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN LET'S TRY IT 
BILL HERE IS THE GARDEN IT'S A WELL STOCKED AFFAIR 
EVERYTHING FROM ACERS TO PEONIES WHAT'S REALLY GOOD IS THE LAYOUT 
IT'S INTRIGUING YES YOU WALK DOWN THAT PATH 
AND YOU'LL DISCOVER A MONSTROUSLY LARGE BARBECUE IT'S LIKE AN ALTAR 
BUT IF YOU EXPLORE DOWN THIS PATH YOU CAN'T HELP BUT STUMBLE ACROSS A SHRINE TO YOUR WOODWORKING SKILLS 
POSSIBLY COME AND HAVE A LOOK AT THIS IT'S HUGE I'M BEGINNING TO GET REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC 
COME IN HERE NOW THIS IS FANTASTIC REALLY I CAN DO SUCH A LOT WITH THIS 
AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE 
OH WELL THERE'S 
IS THERE ANY ACCESS TO IT ONLY THROUGH THE GARDEN 
WELL THAT RESTRICTS THINGS A TINY BIT BUT LOOK AT THE SPACE 
I'M NOT WANTING TO BE RUDE BUT IT'S A BIT OF A PIGSTY 
IT REALLY IS A PIGSTY IS IT IT WAS ORIGINALLY A PIGGERY 
IT'S BEEN CONVERTED INTO THIS FANTASTIC SPACE YES YOU'RE BUBBLING WITH IDEAS ABSOLUTELY 
IT'S A HOUSE IN ITSELF THIS IS BEGINNING TO RAISE MY WHOLE FEEL FOR THE PROPERTY GOOD 
MOIRA MAY FEEL QUITE DIFFERENTLY BUT FOR ME THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL 
I NOTICED AS YOU WALKED AROUND THE HOUSE THAT YOU TENDED TO FEEL IT A LITTLE BIT DARK 
YES THAT'S MY IMPRESSION 
NOTHING THAT CAN'T BE REMEDIED YOU'VE GOT THIS DARK WOOD THEME 
YES I LIKE WOOD BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS DARK AND THE DECOR CAN BE BRIGHTENED UP 
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLY THE DECOR AND I LIKE CREAM WALLS 
CREAM CREAM CREAM THAT WOULD BRING A LOT MORE LIGHT AND THE FRILLS TAKE 
THE PELMETS TAKE THE LIGHT AWAY 
SO LET'S GET DOWN TO MONEY RIGHT LET'S FIND THE OTHERS 
RIGHT GUESS THE PRICE TIME WE WANT YOU TO INDEPENDENTLY GUESS THE VALUE OF EACH HOUSE 
WHO HAS THEIR FINGER ON THE PROPERTY PULSE 
LADIES ALWAYS FIRST WHAT DO YOU THINK GIVE US A PRICE 
FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE TO FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ISH 
FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE TO FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY GIVE US A SOLID PRICE 
TAKE A PICK OH FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN 
I'M GOING TO COMPROMISE BILL RIGHT 
IT'S TRICKY COS IT'S OUT OF OUR AREA YES I DON'T KNOW THE PRICES 
I WOULD HAVE SAID 
FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE PERHAPS SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THAT'S COS HE LIKES THE BACK GARDEN TRUE 
IT'S A PIGSTY THAT'S KIND OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNDER YOUR POTENTIAL BUDGET OR MOIRA'S POTENTIAL BUDGET 
INTERESTING COS WE KNOW YOU SPOKE TO THE ESTATE AGENT BEHIND OUR BACKS AND FOUND OUT THE PRICE 
ANYBODY GOING TO ADMIT TO IT NO 
YOU DENY IT THEY'RE LYING THEY'VE SPOKEN TO THE ESTATE AGENT 
I DIDN'T KNOW WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO ASK 
INCREDIBLY THE PRICE IS FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE AMAZING YOU WERE EITHER SIDE OF IT 
NOTHING WRONG WITH CHEATING IF YOU GET AWAY WITH IT I'M SMACK ON IT'S DEFINITELY YOU 
I LIKE THE WAY YOU DIDN'T GO FOR IT BANG ON THE NAIL 
SUBTLE SUBTLE 
WELL COME ON KNOWING THAT NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK 
EM IT'S A BARGAIN 
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FACILITIES A LOT OF HOUSE HERE 
SO YOU LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF HOUSE I THINK SO 
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF HOUSE UNTIL YOU SEE THE HOUSE I SHOW YOU 
MY CHOICE THIS WAY NO TALKING TO ESTATE AGENTS PROMISE LIPS ARE SEALED 
FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS

LET'S HOPE YOUR TWENTIES OPTIMISM DOESN'T LEAD TO A GREAT DEPRESSION I'VE GOT MY JAZZ HANDS GOING 
OH CLASSIC HALL THE WHOLE HOUSE IS A BIT OF A CLASSIC REALLY 
IT'S CERTAINLY GOT A STYLE AND AN ELEGANCE HIGH CEILINGS 
MICHELANGELO GAVE A QUOTE FOR THE DECOR 
DINING ROOM I SHOULD THINK 
THE FIREPLACE SEEMS ODD FOR THE AGE IT'S INCONGRUOUS 
THAT'S A NINETEEN SIXTIES NINETEEN SEVENTIES UPGRADE ISN'T IT 
I'D RUN OUT TO A RECLAMATION YARD AND BUY LOVELY ART NOUVEAU FIREPLACES TO POP BACK IN POSITION 
YEAH YOU'VE NEED A LOT OF MONEY YOU'VE BE NOUVEAU RICHE 
IT'S A COOL AND ELEGANT ROOM YES I THINK YOU COULD BE VERY COMFORTABLE IN HERE 
NICE SIZE AS WELL I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS HOUSE FEELS A LOT AIRIER IT'S A LOT BRIGHTER IN THERE 
OH SITTING ROOM A PRETTY SHAPED ROOM ISN'T IT IT'S A GOOD SIZE YES 
I LIKE THE FRENCH WINDOWS DOWN THE SIDE 
MOIRA'S VERY MUCH INTO HER WINDOWS AND THE SHAPE OF HER ROOMS 
SHE'S USED TO LOOKING THROUGH THINGS THIS IS TRUE 
OH BREAKFAST ROOM 
THIS IS A NICE LITTLE ROOM YES 
THIS IS AN ATTRACTIVE SHAPE ACTUALLY 
YOU'VE GOT THE BEST OF A LARGE KITCHEN WITHOUT A PLAIN SQUARE ROOM 
SHE TALKS ABOUT ATTRACTIVE SHAPE LIKE SHE'S WANDERING THROUGH AN ART GALLERY 
I COULD SEE ONE COOKING A BIT IN HERE NICE LARGE RANGE 
YEAH NOT QUITE AN AGA BUT GAS BY THE LOOK OF IT 
SHE WANTED A LARGE KITCHEN LARGE RANGE LARGE DINING TABLE ALL THERE FOR THE TAKING 
A BATHROOM 
DOWNSTAIRS 
VERY LILAC IT'S BEEN RECENTLY DONE HASN'T IT 
YES SO IF A MAJOR BATHROOM IS DOWN HERE I WONDER WHAT'S UPSTAIRS I WONDER WHAT'S UPSTAIRS 
ARCHITECTURALLY IT'S ALL ABOUT ETIQUETTE EVERYTHING'S SO POLITE AND WELL PROPORTIONED 
AND VERY WELL BEHAVED NOTHING JARS OR FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE WHY DID YOU LIKE IT THEN 
BIT OF A SECRET REBEL 
BATHROOM 
OH BIG SHOWER BIG SHOWER 
IT'S SUPER SUPER THAT'S GREAT IT'S A BIG ROOM 
THAT DOUBLE SHOWER IS A LOVELY FEATURE PLENTY OF ROOM IN THERE TO SWILL YOUR MOUTH OUT YES 
THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG FRONT ONES AH THAT'S ATTRACTIVE YES 
ON TOP OF THAT BIG SITTING ROOM YES THIS IS MUM AND DAD'S ROOM 
IT'S ALL A LITTLE BIT MORE EXOTIC OH YES IT'S GOT A BIG SHOWER 
OH YES 
A BIG DOUBLE SIZED ONE 
THEY'RE NOT SURE WHAT THEY WANT WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR 
KNOW WHAT'S CONFUSING THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY BATHROOMS 
WHICH WAY ROUND IS THE HOUSE 
MM WELL THE GARDEN'S TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST ISN'T IT I THINK 
AT THE NEXT HOUSE I'LL GIVE HIM A COMPASS SO HE WON'T QUESTION IT 
HE'S OBSESSED WITH HIS ASPECT 
IT'S A SPACIOUS AND ELEGANT FEEL ABOUT THE HOUSE 
I LIKE THE HIGH CEILINGS WHETHER IT'S TOO BIG FOR US OR NOT I DON'T KNOW 
THEY SEEM INCREDIBLY POLITE ABOUT IT BUT IS IT JUST A VENEER 
SHALL WE CONVINCE THEM FURTHER LET'S POLISH THEM OFF 
RIGHT MOIRA WEAVING FROM THE KITCHEN TO THE DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 
YOU WEREN'T HAPPY WITH THE COLOUR THE CONCEPT THE WHOLE THING 
I COULD SEE THE SENSE OF HAVING IT DOWNSTAIRS 
YOU'VE GOT ONE UPSTAIRS AND ALSO TWO OTHER SHOWER ROOMS DO YOU REALLY NEED THIS AS WELL 
I'D HAVE IT AS A LAUNDRY ROOM 
SPOT ON A UTILITY SPACE EXACTLY 
THE TWO DON'T FIGHT NO AND YOU CAN BOX THEM IN IN CUPBOARDS EVEN 
YOU DON'T NEED ME TO TELL YOU THIS 
BILL I'M SURE YOU NOTICED THIS LARGE GARAGE 
YES SIMON YOU COULD HARDLY MISS IT 
AND YET HERE WE HAVE THIS VERY SMALL DARK SHED AS PART OF IT 
IT'S ODD ISN'T IT YES O. K. I'M SURE YOU'LL SHOW ME MORE 
BEAR IN MIND THE TRAP DOOR COME WITH ME POST HASTE COME ALONG 
BECAUSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT WE HAVE THIS LOVELY GORGEOUS LIGHT SPACE RIGHT 
SEE WHAT ARE WE THINKING 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ARE WE THINKING WHAT WE'RE THINKING IS WHY IS THIS WALL HERE 
I'D TAKE IT DOWN OF COURSE AND SO WOULD I 
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO GET RID OF THAT 
ABOUT HALF AN HOUR I THINK 
I THINK POSSIBLY LESS IF YOU HAVE A CUP OF TEA IN THE MIDDLE 
THE OTHER THING TO BEAR IN MIND IS THE TRAP DOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE 
YOU'VE GOT FANTASTIC STORAGE SPACE A VERY STEEP PITCH 
YOU'VE GOT ALL THE STORAGE SPACE YOU NEED FOR YOUR BITS AND BOBS 
AND THIS GREAT WORKSHOP YOU COULD MAKE THIS WORK 
ARE WE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE PRICE EM LET'S THINK ABOUT IT NO LET'S GO AND FIND OUT 
COME ON O. K. 
BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER WE DIDN'T COME ACROSS ANY ESTATE AGENTS IN THE GARAGE OR THE BATHROOM 
SO YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD THE PRICE UNFORTUNATELY NO SO THIS IS A TRUE GUESS 
WE HAVE OUR BUDGET OF AROUND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FOR MOIRA 
WE'VE HAD A LOOK ROUND THIS GORGEOUS PROPERTY WITH ITS FIVE BEDROOMS

I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY NOTHING IT'S UNREASONABLY PRETTY 
JUST DON'T PUT A BONFIRE TOO CLOSE EXACTLY 
ANOTHER REASON WHY WE ARE CHAMPIONING THIS PROPERTY IS BECAUSE YOU SAID 
YOU WANTED LESS ROOMS BUT MORE SPACE I THOUGHT IT WAS AN OXYMORON 
WHAT DID YOU CALL ME I DIDN'T AIM THAT AT YOU AN OXYMORON 
BUT I THINK WE MAY HAVE SOLVED IT WE HAVE GIVEN YOU LESS ROOMS AND MORE SPACE TO ENTERTAIN 
MORE SPACE TO DINE MORE SPACE TO KICK BACK AND RELAX 
IT'S CERTAINLY PEACEFUL SO GO IN THERE HAVE A LOOK ROUND AND ENJOY 
RIGHT GO ON THANK YOU LET'S GO AND LOOK AT IT 
AN OXYMORON IS A PROBLEM THAT YOU THINK STOP INSULTING ME

THE FACT THE ROOF GOES UP SO STEEPLY MEANS PLENTY OF HEADROOM 
APART FROM VERY CLOSE TO THE EDGES ALTHOUGH THE WINDOWS ARE SMALL IT'S VERY LIGHT 
THIS IS THE OLDEST PART ISN'T IT YES YOU NEED THE OTHER STAIRCASE 
DOWN AGAIN AND UP AGAIN O. K. I LOVE THE WAY THE INTERNAL SPACE IS DIVIDED UP I'M DELIRIOUS 
AND TO THE RIGHT OH A GOOD SIZED ROOM

IT'S SPACIOUS IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU GET THAT 
A VIEW OVER THE FIELDS IT JUST GIVES YOU A NICE FEELING OF CLEANLINESS REALLY 
THAT'S MORE OUR STYLE THAN SOME OF THE MORE EXOTIC FURNISHINGS THAT WE SAW YES 
THREE BEDROOMS BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED OH A CORNER LOO 
SUPER IT'S DIFFERENT THERE'S YOUR SHOWER THE SHOWER 
HOPE IT'S GOT POWER ON IT YOU'D ONLY GET A LITTLE TRICKLE HERE

I MIGHT HAVE GUESSED NEVER MIND THE WORKSHOP 
BUT AWAY FROM THE WORKSHOP AWAY AWAY 
NEVER MIND YOUR BOYS WITH TOYS ROOM THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE OF THE PROPERTY NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT 
THIS IS IT RIGHT THIS PLOT HERE THAT RUNS AROUND TO THE GATE INTO THE FIELD 
AND TO THE HAWTHORN TREES AT THE BACK IS PART OF THE PROPERTY 
WHAT COULD WE DO WITH THIS A VERY DESIRABLE BED OF NETTLES 
AT THE MOMENT IT COULD BE ANYTHING 
I JUST WANTED YOU TO BE AWARE OF THE FULL EXTENT OF THE PROPERTY 
THIS IS ALMOST ANOTHER WORKSHOP ABSOLUTELY NO YOU CAN'T 
THAT'S QUITE BIG ENOUGH 
RIGHT SO YEAH WE'VE SEEN THE BOUNDARIES THE FULL EXTENT OF IT 
AND A GORGEOUS LITTLE PROPERTY IT IS YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
MOIRA OUT HERE EXPLORING THE COUNTRYSIDE ONCE MORE LOVELY LANE 
SHOULD YOU WISH TO KNOW THERE ARE PUBLIC FOOTPATHS THAT WEAVE ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE 
IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR A STROLL IT CAN BE DONE IN MY GREEN WELLIES 
LET'S LOOK AT THE PROPERTY ITSELF 
THERE'S THE OLD BIT AND THE NEW BIT I'M AFRAID YOUR SIXTEENTH CENTURY COTTAGE NEEDS A NEW HAIRDO 
I DID WONDER ACTUALLY YES IT'S A BIT UNKEMPT 
IT'S COME TO THE END OF ITS LIFE A THATCH WILL LAST ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS O. K. 
IT WILL SEE ME OUT DON'T SAY THAT ORIGINALLY THEY WERE MADE OF STRAW 
IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THEY STARTED USING WATER WEED WHICH IS MORE DURABLE YEAH 
THEY DON'T TAKE THE WHOLE ROOF OFF THEY TAKE IT BACK ABOUT NINE INCHES 
AND INTERWEAVE THE NEW WATER REED WITH THE OLD FOR A FANTASTIC ROOF 
THEN WITH BLADED TOOLS THEY SCULPT IT INTO SHAPE TO GET THOSE LOVELY FORMS OVER THE WINDOWS 
DO THEY PUT IT IN IN BUNDLES YES 
I'M GOING TO SHOCK YOU NOW GO ON TRY COULD IT BE TILED 
IF YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE TROUBLE OF HAVING A NEW ROOF COULD YOU NOT MATCH IT UP 
SPEECHLESS I CAN'T SPEAK I'M SHOCKED I DID SAY I WASN'T INTO THATCHES 
THEY LOOK VERY CHOCOLATE BOXY IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TILE IT 
IT'S GRADE TWO LISTED FOR A START OH IS IT WHICH WOULD MAKE IT TRICKY FOR YOU 
AND I WOULD PERSONALLY COME AND STOP YOU FROM TILING IT O. K. 
IS THAT ENOUGH SAID YES I THINK WE NEED TO GO AND DISCUSS THE PRICE MADAM O. K. FINE YEAH 
RIGHT AS WE BOUND PAST THE FRENCH LAVENDER WE POSITION OURSELVES 
FOR THE THIRD AND FINAL GUESS THE PRICE TIME 
IF WE CAST OUR MINDS BACK THE FIRST PROPERTY YOU DID CHEAT 
UNINTENTIONALLY PLEASE IN MY NAIVETE SO THAT'S VOID 
SO YOU'VE GOT ONE RIGHT BUT YOU CAN LEVEL PEG THIS ONE I DOUBT IT YOU NEVER KNOW 
IS IT SOMETHING I COULD GET MY TEETH INTO 
I WANTED TO SAY THAT BEFORE YOU 
YOUR BUDGET IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND YOU'VE SEEN THIS GORGEOUS PROPERTY 
WHAT WOULD YOU ESTIMATE ITS VALUE LADIES FIRST FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY O. K. 
GO ON BILL WIN IT THIS TIME FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY 
WELL I KNOW THE PRICE 
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
TWO TO ZERO TO MOIRA OH GREAT ABSOLUTELY 
STORY OF MY LIFE THAT'S WHY HE MARRIED ME 
I CAN PLEASANTLY SURPRISE YOU NOW 
THIS BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY IS ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
WOW NOW YOU'VE SEEN ALL THREE OF OUR LOVELY PROPERTIES 
BUT YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH ONE YOU'D LIKE TO SPEND MORE TIME IN FOR YOUR TEST DRIVE 
INDEED RIGHT DIFFICULT DECISION 
IT IS A TOUGHIE WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF VERY NICE PROPERTIES OH YES AN INTERESTING JOURNEY 
I'M HOLDING THIS LAPTOP BECAUSE IN IT WE HAVE PUT IMAGES OF ALL THREE PROPERTIES 
ALL THE ROOMS VIEWS VISTAS AND PRICES YOU CAN TAKE THAT AWAY AND MAKE A NICE SLOW DECISION 
BECAUSE YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY THE BRAINS IN THIS RELATIONSHIP I'M GIVING IT TO THE LADY 
I'M JUST HERE FOR THE MUSCLE 
YOU GUYS DISAPPEAR AND WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT YOUR DECISION IS LATER 
I HAVE TO SAY I WOULD NOT WANT THE TASK OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THOSE THREE LOVELY HOUSES I AGREE 
PROPERTY ONE WAS A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE IN WYRE PIDDLE IN WORCESTERSHIRE 
A FAMILY HOME WITH A CONVERTED PIGGERY 
OR PROPERTY NUMBER TWO THE NINETEEN TWENTIES HOUSE JUST OUTSIDE EVESHAM 
WITH THE LARGE LIVING SPACE AND FIVE BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS 
OR WILL IT BE OUR GORGEOUS WILD CARD 
THE THREE BED THATCHED COTTAGE DECORATED IMMACULATELY IT ALSO BOASTS SUPERB OUTBUILDINGS 
WILL OUR COUPLE FIND THEIR IDEAL HOME IN PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
OR PERHAPS NUMBER TWO OR PROPERTY NUMBER THREE 
IT'S DECISION TIME 
HERE WE ARE IN MEMORY LANE AS BILL TAKES THE WHEEL OF HIS PRIDE AND JOY TO DRIVE TO THEIR CHOSEN PROPERTY 
I COULD GET VERY ACCUSTOMED TO TRAVELLING LIKE THIS 
THAT IS WHAT I CALL AN ARRIVAL MARVELLOUS ARRIVING IN STYLE 
AND ARRIVING AT A VERY STYLISH PROPERTY 
IT IS KIND OF INCONCEIVABLE IF YOU'VE GOT A CAR LIKE THAT YOU HAD TO CHOOSE THE WILD CARD 
SOMEWHERE TO PUT IT 
THEY JUST MATCH DON'T THEY THEY SIT TOGETHER PERFECTLY WELL 
WHILST YOU WERE DECIDING OUR MAN IN THE KNOW OUR OWN SURVEYOR GAVE THIS PLACE THE ONCE OVER 
AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS HE IS NORMALLY AS HAPPY AS A FARMER WITH A FERRET DOWN HIS TROUSERS 
WITH OLD PROPERTIES HE REALLY PULLS THEM TO BITS IT'S NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY 
AND WE ALWAYS RECOMMEND YOU GET A FULL STRUCTURAL SURVEY 
BUT HE WAS VERY IMPRESSED NOW HE IS ONE TO HAVE A COMPLAINT 
BUT THE ONLY THING HE REALLY PICKED UP ON YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN TOLD THE THATCH THE HAIRDO 
IT QUITE OBVIOUSLY NEEDS REPLACING AND HE DID ALSO STRESS AS KRISTIAN DID 
THAT IT IS GRADE TWO LISTED AND IF YOU EVER THOUGHT OF TILING IT 
THE AUTHORITIES WILL BE ROUND KRISTIAN WILL AND SO WOULD I 
SORRY ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE A CUP OF TEA 
VERY QUICKLY WHEN THAT PART WAS BEING BUILT THIS PART WAS MODERNISED ALL REWIRED REPLUMBED 
MAKE SURE IT HAS ALL THE BUILDING GUARANTEES AND THOSE THINGS 
BUT IT'S FIVE STAR WE LOVE IT VERY MUCH GET IN THAT DOOR ENJOY YOUR TEST DRIVE 
AND HOPEFULLY LATER ON WE'LL GET THUMBS UP FROM YOU GUYS 
JUST DO IT ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY FEEL LIKE A LITTLE RAMBLE WITH THE PICNIC BLANKET 
CERTAINLY MY LITTLE DARLING BUD 
MOIRA IS MAKING HERSELF ALL BRIGHT EYED AND BUSHY TAILED 
WHO'S THAT AT THE DOOR IT'S DAUGHTER ANNA WHAT A LOVELY PAIR 
MEANWHILE BILL'S OUT IN THE OUTBUILDINGS WITH HIS HEAD UNDER THE BONNET 
OH WOW DAD'S WHERE DO YOU THINK 
MM YES HE'S FOUND THE WORKSHOP THEN 
MOIRA'S NOT TO BE OUTDONE SHE FANCIES CLUBBING 
THAT'S A BIT ROUGH ON THE OLD CAR BUT IS IT A HOLE IN ONE
