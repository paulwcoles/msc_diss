THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY TO VISIT EIGHTY INSPIRING GARDENS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
SOME ARE VERY WELL KNOWN LIKE THE TAJ MAHAL OR THE ALHAMBRA 
AND I'M ALSO CHALLENGING MY IDEA OF WHAT A GARDEN ACTUALLY IS 
SO I'M VISITING GARDENS THAT FLOAT ON THE AMAZON 
A STRANGE FANTASY IN THE JUNGLE 
AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE HOMES OF GREAT DESIGNERS 
AND THE DESERT FLOWERING IN A GARDEN 
AND WHEREVER I GO I SHALL BE MEETING PEOPLE THAT SHARE MY OWN PASSION FOR GARDENS 
ON MY EPIC QUEST TO SEE THE WORLD THROUGH EIGHTY OF ITS MOST FASCINATING AND BEAUTIFUL GARDENS 
IN MODERN TIMES AT LEAST NORTHERN EUROPE HAS BEEN THE PLACE 
WHERE GARDENS AND GARDENING HAVE BEEN THE MOST VIBRANT AND DYNAMIC 
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF HISTORIC GARDENS ACROSS THE REGION 
THAT ONE CAN VISIT AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DO JUST THAT EVERY YEAR 
THERE IS CLEARLY A COMMON DESIRE TO WALK THROUGH THE PAST VIA THE MEDIUM OF A GARDEN 
YET THERE IS AN OVERRIDING PARADOX ACCOMPANYING THAT 
HOW DO YOU PRESERVE THE HISTORY OF GARDENS AND YET KEEP THEM ALIVE 
AND ACCEPT THE FACT THAT ALL GARDENS CHANGE ALL THE TIME 
MY JOURNEY BEGINS WITH THE QUINTESSENTIAL ENGLISH LANDSCAPE GARDEN 
IT THEN TAKES ME ACROSS THE CHANNEL TO THE GRAND AND SUMPTUOUS GARDENS OF FRANCE 
I SHALL THEN TRACK BACK TO BELGIUM AND THE NETHERLANDS 
AND THE GARDENS OF SOME OF MY OWN PERSONAL DESIGN HEROES 
FINALLY I WILL TRAVEL TO THE FAR NORTH BEYOND THE ARCTIC CIRCLE 
TO A GARDEN WHERE FOR A FEW SUMMER MONTHS THE SUN NEVER SETS 
THE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE FACING THIS JOURNEY 
WAS TO WHITTLE THE GARDENS DOWN TO AN ACCEPTABLE NUMBER 
I MEAN I COULD HAVE CHOSEN EIGHTY GARDENS JUST FROM NORTHERN EUROPE ALONE 
SO THE WAY I'VE RESOLVED THAT IS TO MAKE IT AN ENTIRELY PERSONAL JOURNEY 
THE GARDENS I'M ABOUT TO VISIT ARE EITHER ONES THAT I'VE BEEN LONGING TO SEE ALL MY LIFE 
OR ONES THAT I'VE BEEN TO BEFORE 
I KNOW WELL AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU 
I AM STARTING WITH THE ONLY ENGLISH GARDENS IN MY ENTIRE ROUND THE WORLD JOURNEY 
I HAVE CHOSEN THEM BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT 
I THINK THAT THEY REPRESENT THE VERY BEST OF BRITISH GARDENS 
IN FACT BOTH ARE AMONGST THE VERY BEST IN THE WORLD 
THE FIRST IS ROUSHAM IN OXFORDSHIRE 
ROUSHAM DESIGNED BY WILLIAM KENT 
IS ASTONISHINGLY LITTLE KNOWN OR VISITED 
YET I THINK IT'S THE BEST LANDSCAPE GARDEN IN THE COUNTRY 
IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN KENT THEN BETTER KNOWN AS AN ARCHITECT 
WAS HIRED BY THE OWNER GENERAL DORMER TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS 
TO THE HOUSE AT ROUSHAM AND TO REVAMP THE GARDEN 
IN THE DRAWING ROOM OF THE HOUSE IS THIS PLAN OF THE GARDEN 
WE DON'T KNOW WHO DREW IT BUT WE KNOW THAT IT WAS DRAWN UP 
ROUND ABOUT THE TIME OF KENT'S DEATH IN THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTIES 
AND IT SHOWS THE LAYOUT AS KENT INTENDED IT 
AND IT ALSO SHOWS IT ALMOST EXACTLY AS IT IS TODAY 
IT'S HARDLY CHANGED AT ALL 
THE HEAD GARDENER AT THE TIME THAT THIS WAS DRAWN UP MCCLEARY 
USED TO TAKE PEOPLE ROUND DOWN HERE DOWN THIS PATH 
AND THEN ROUND DOWN THERE AND THEN BACK UP THAT AVENUE 
AND ALONG THE BOTTOM 
AND THAT'S THE ROUTE THAT I'M GOING TO TAKE 
KENT'S RADICAL CONTRIBUTION TO GARDEN DESIGN 
WAS TO INCLUDE THE LANDSCAPE AS PART OF THE PICTURE 
UP TILL THEN 
GARDENS HAD TRIED TO BE REFUGES FROM WHAT WAS SEEN AS A POTENTIALLY HOSTILE WORLD AROUND THEM 
AND HERE AT ROUSHAM HE DELIBERATELY SCULPTED THE LAND 
WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL CURVE DOWN TO THE RIVER DIDN'T OBSCURE THAT 
AND THEN THE FIELD AND THE MEADOW BELOW AND THE CATTLE GRAZING 
WHICH WERE MEANT TO BE SEEN 
THE ROAD LEFT UNOBSCURED SO THEY COULD SEE DROVES OF CATTLE GOING ACROSS 
AND THEN THERE ARE TWO BUILDINGS UP THERE ONE WHICH WAS A COTTAGE WHICH HE RESHAPED TO LOOK AS 
THOUGH IT MIGHT JUST BE A CASTLE 
AND THE EYE CATCHER ON THE HORIZON TOTALLY FALSE 
IT'S JUST A WALL 
THIS WAS REVOLUTIONARY 
FOR THE FIRST TIME A VERY ENGLISH RURAL VIEW WAS INCLUDED 
AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE GARDEN 
I FIND WILLIAM KENT A FASCINATING CHARACTER 
HE WAS CERTAINLY NO GARDENER 
WE KNOW THAT HE AVOIDED VISITING THE SITE AS FAR AS HE COULD 
AND WAS NOTORIOUSLY CARELESS ON DETAILS OF CONSTRUCTION 
HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A SEMI LITERATE DRUNKEN YORKSHIREMAN 
WITH A KNACK OF SMOOZING THE ARISTOCRACY 
BUT I THINK HE WAS ALSO ON THE EVIDENCE OF HIS WORK HERE AND AT STOWE TOUCHED WITH TRUE GREATNESS 
THIS ROUTE TAKES YOU THROUGH THE WOODS AND DOWN HERE INTO WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE VALE OF VENUS 
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF LANDSCAPING BUT 
FOR KENT IT WAS MUCH MUCH MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE IT'S FULL OF ALLEGORIES AND REFERENCES 
SOME OF THEM ARCHITECTURAL LIKE THE SHAPE OF THE CASCADE 
WHICH HAD ITALIAN REFERENCES THAT ONLY PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN ON THE GRAND TOUR WOULD HAVE KNOWN 
AND THERE'S VENUS HERSELF WHO IS THE GODDESS OF GARDENS 
AND THE FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE COME HERE 
WOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL THAT THEY WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT 
IT WAS A SORT OF KIND OF THEME PARK IN THE WAY THAT WE GO AND WE KNOW ABOUT DISNEY 
WE KNOW ABOUT THE FILMS AND WE PICK UP THE REFERENCES 
AND OF COURSE FOR MOST PEOPLE NOW THERE'S NONE OF THAT 
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING BEYOND ITS BEAUTY 
NOW I THINK THAT'S FINE I THINK THE BEAUTY IS ENOUGH 
BUT THERE IS ONE EXTRA BONUS THAT WE GET THAT THEY DON'T AND OF COURSE THAT'S THE MATURITY 
NOW I THINK ON A RAINY OVERCAST DAY IN JUNE 
THIS IS AS BEAUTIFUL AS PRACTICALLY ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN IN THE WORLD 
AND A COMPLETE GENIUS TO TAKE WATER AND FORMALISE IT 
AND YET KEEP IT SINUOUS WITH THE UNDERSTORY OF THE LAUREL AND THE BOX CLIPPED 
BUT MASSIVE IN CONCEPTION AND IN SCALE 
THE BALANCE THE LIGHT THE SIMPLICITY 
MADE IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY AND I TELL YOU IT'S AS MODERN AS ANYTHING I'VE SEEN 
SOME OF THE LAYOUT OF ROUSHAM CAN BE CREDITED TO KENT'S CONTEMPORARY 
THE ROYAL GARDENER CHARLES BRIDGEMAN 
WHO LAID OUT DESIGNS HERE SOME TWENTY YEARS EARLIER 
IN BRIDGEMAN'S DESIGN THIS NATURAL STREAM WAS ALLOWED TO RUN FREE 
BUT IT WAS KENT'S INSPIRATION TO FORMALISE IT 
AND TO ADD THE OCTAGONAL COLD BATH 
AND LIKE MUCH IN THIS GARDEN KENT'S BRILLIANCE WAS TO STIMULATE THE SENSES AS WELL AS THE MIND 
WHAT THIS GARDEN HAS MORE THAN ANY OTHER GARDEN I'VE EVER SEEN 
IS A SORT OF PERFECT GREENNESS 
THE USE OF GREEN AND THE LAYERS OF IT AND THE LAYERS OF LIGHT 
THAT FILTER THROUGH THE GREEN IS JUST SUBLIME 
NOW THIS ARCADE OF THE TEMPLE OF PRINESTI AS KENT CALLED IT 
HAS ALCOVES AND NICHES 
AND ORIGINALLY THERE WAS A STATUE IN EACH OF THE NICHES AND A SEAT IN EACH OF THESE ALCOVES 
THE IDEA BEING OF COURSE THAT THE VISITOR COULD SIT AND TAKE IN YET ANOTHER FABULOUS VIEW 
AND WHAT YOU GET FROM ALL THESE VIEWS AND IN FACT ALL THESE SCENES IS THAT IT'S A THEATRE 
THE GARDEN IS LIKE A STAGE SET WAITING FOR THE ACTORS TO COME 
AND OF COURSE YOU THE VISITOR ARE THE ACTORS 
AND THEN THE WHOLE THING SUDDENLY BECOMES ALIVE AND IS MADE COMPLETE 
ROUSHAM IS MY FAVOURITE GARDEN IN ENGLAND 
AND THIS VISIT HAS REINFORCED 
THE FACT THAT IT IS A STAGGERING WORK 
I THINK KENT WAS A GENIUS A TRUE GENIUS 
AND HE'S RIGHT AT THE TOP OF HIS ART HERE 
AND IT MAKES IT ONE OF THE GREAT GARDENS OF THE WORLD 
AND HE USES PRACTICALLY JUST ONE COLOUR AND SOME VERY SIMPLE IDEAS 
AND IT PROVES THE OLD ADAGE IT'S NOT REALLY YOU DO 
BUT HOW YOU DO IT THAT MATTERS 
AND ALSO REINFORCES TO ME THAT TO A DEGREE OVER THE LAST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HUNDREDTHS YEARS 
BRITISH GARDENS HAVE BEEN HIJACKED BY FLOWERS 
WE'RE OBSESSED BY PLANTS AND THEIR VARIETY AND THEIR COLOUR 
AND HOW TO GROW THEM AND WE'VE SORT OF LOST THE BIG PICTURE 
WE'VE LOST THIS SENSE OF A BIG IDEA 
EXPRESSED WITH PANACHE AND VERY SIMPLY 
AND IF YOU WANT TO FIND THAT AGAIN WELL YOU CAN DO NO BETTER THAN COME TO ROUSHAM 
IT IS A WRENCH TO LEAVE BUT I MUST MOVE ON AND MY NEXT GARDEN 
IS ANOTHER OF THE TRULY GREAT ONES ALBEIT VERY DIFFERENT FROM ROUSHAM 
IT IS THE WORLD FAMOUS GARDEN OF SISSINGHURST IN KENT 
NOW I'VE KNOWN THIS GARDEN FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND BEEN VISITING IT REGULARLY 
BECAUSE THE CURRENT OCCUPANT IS A VERY OLD FRIEND OF MINE 
BUT IT'S BEEN A NATIONAL TRUST GARDEN FOR AROUND FORTY YEARS 
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE NATIONAL TRUST HAVE A PARTICULAR HOLD ON THE BRITISH PSYCHE 
THEY COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND OUR LOVE FOR THE PAST 
PARTICULARLY AS MANIFESTED BY HOUSES AND GARDENS 
AND OF COURSE SISSINGHURST IS THE VERY BEST OF THE NATIONAL TRUST GARDENS 
SISSINGHURST REPRESENTS AND EXEMPLIFIES 
ALL THAT THE ENGLISH ASPIRE TO IN A GARDEN 
NOT LEAST BECAUSE IT IS THE SETTING FOR THE KIND OF ARISTOCRATIC ROMPS THAT THE BRITISH SO LOVE 
GARDENING AND SEX 
DAYS OUT DON'T COME MUCH BETTER THAN THAT 
ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS A CUP OF TEA AND A PIECE OF CAKE THROWN IN TOO 
SISSINGHURST IS A COLLECTION OF TEN DISTINCT GARDEN ROOMS 
AND IT WAS BEGUN IN NINETEEN THIRTY BY THE POET AND NOVELIST VITA SACKVILLE WEST 
AND HER HUSBAND SIR HAROLD NICOLSON 
THIS IS THE FIRST OF THE GARDEN ROOMS THEY DESIGNED THE COTTAGE GARDEN 
THE COTTAGE GARDEN HERE AT SISSINGHURST 
TAPS DIRECTLY 
INTO ALMOST EVERY ENGLISHMAN AND WOMAN'S PERCEPTION AND DESIRE FOR THE PERFECT GARDEN 
IT FULFILS THE NEED FOR CHARM 
FOR A RURAL ARCADIA AND ABOVE ALL FOR COLOUR A PROFUSION OF PLANTS 
BUT OF COURSE ALMOST EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS COTTAGE GARDEN IS MORE THAN IT SEEMS 
IT'S VERY CAREFULLY DESIGNED 
THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF EXTRAORDINARY PLANTS THAT ARE VERY HIGH MAINTENANCE 
AND LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE AT SISSINGHURST 
THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO IT THAN FIRST OF ALL MEETS THE EYE 
SISSINGHURST IS OF COURSE NO COTTAGE 
BUT A STAGGERINGLY BEAUTIFUL TUDOR CASTLE 
AND WHILE THE TRADITIONAL COTTAGE GARDEN 
WAS A HAPHAZARD JUMBLE OF FLOWERS FRUIT AND LOTS OF VEGETABLES 
DESPITE THE LOOK OF INFORMALITY 
THE PLANTING HERE IS SOPHISTICATED AND MANAGED BEYOND THE WILDEST DREAMS OF ANY COTTAGER 
THE JOB OF MAINTAINING ALL OF SISSINGHURST'S TEN GARDEN ROOMS 
FALLS TO THE HEAD GARDENER ALEXIS DATTA 
PART OF THE TRUST'S LARGE TEAM IN CHARGE OF CURATING THIS PIECE OF OUR NATIONAL HERITAGE 
HOW DO YOU MANAGE THAT SORT OF MUSEUM ELEMENT OF THE GARDEN 
WELL I THINK THAT'S QUITE A GOOD QUESTION 
COS MUSEUM ELEMENT IS JUST WHAT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE 
IT IS A LIVING THING IT MOVES AND CHANGES ALL THE TIME PLANTS LIVE AND DIE 
AND SO I DON'T WANT IT TO BE AT ALL MUSEUMY 
AND THE IDEA IS THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE SORT OF IDEALISED MAYBE VERSION OF WHAT HAROLD AND VITA MADE 
SO WE'RE FOREVER CHANGING THINGS BUT WE TRY AND DO IT SLIGHTLY RATHER THAN IN A BIG WAY 
SO IT'S A LOT OF CHANGE IN ORDER THAT IT MIGHT STAY ROUGHLY THE SAME 
YES EXACTLY YES YEAH 
THAT SAID IN A HISTORICAL GARDEN LIKE THIS ALEXIS HAS TO TREAD A FINE LINE BETWEEN 
THE INEVITABILITY OF CHANGE AND THE PUBLIC'S DESIRE TO SEE THE GARDEN REMAIN EXACTLY THE SAME 
IF SISSINGHURST IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS GARDENS IN THE WORLD 
CERTAINLY THE WHITE GARDEN IS THE MOST FAMOUS PART OF SISSINGHURST 
IT'S ICONIC AND HAS SPAWNED ONE THOUSAND IMITATIONS 
NONE OF WHICH ARE AS GOOD 
THE REASON WHY THE WHITE GARDEN WORKS SO WELL IS ACTUALLY NOT JUST TO DO WITH THE WHITE 
THE FIRST THING IS IT'S TO DO WITH THE VOLUME 
IT'S GOT THIS WONDERFUL HIGH BOX HEDGES AND IN FACT 
THEY'RE MUCH HIGHER AT THIS END 
THEY GET TALLER AND TALLER AS THEY GO DOWN SO THAT THE OVERALL LEVEL IS CONSTANT 
AND THAT CREATES THESE SPACES THAT ARE VERY SATISFYING AND WHICH THEN SPILL OVER WITH WHITE FLOWERS 
AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS IT MAYBE CALLED A WHITE GARDEN BUT IT'S PREDOMINANTLY A GREEN GARDEN 
THERE'S ALL THESE DIFFERENT SHADES OF GREEN WHICH THEN 
JUST HAVE A SPRINKLING OF WHITE AND IT'S THAT VERY PURE COMBINATION THAT MAKES IT SO SATISFYING 
TODAY WHILE THE NATIONAL TRUST MAY OWN AND MAINTAIN SISSINGHURST 
VITA AND HAROLD'S GRANDSON ADAM NICOLSON LIVES HERE 
ADAM YOU GREW UP HERE WHAT WAS IT LIKE AS A CHILD WHAT WAS IT LIKE ALL THOSE YEARS AGO 
WELL YOU CAN NEVER YOU CAN NEVER SORT OF TAKE IT SERIOUSLY 
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE LIVING IN A SHRINE REALLY 
SO IT'S A GREAT BIKING GROUND 
I HAD A VERY GOOD TRACK THAT CAME THROUGH THE ARCH THERE 
DOWN INTO THE ROSE GARDEN AND THEN DOWN TO THE HERB GARDEN 
ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS I COULD DO IT YOU KNOW IF THERE WEREN'T TOO MANY PEOPLE THERE 
IT'S UNIMAGINABLE NO I KNOW 
I'M QUITE TEMPTED TO DO IT AGAIN 
NO IT IS BUT YOU KNOW I THINK IN THE SIXTIES WHEN I WAS A BOY 
PROBABLY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR CAME 
AND NOW IT'S ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND EVEN SO IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT KETTLE OF FISH 
WHY DO YOU THINK SISSINGHURST HAS BECOME SUCH AN ICON 
AND SUCH A SORT OF ARCHETYPE OF THE IDEAL COUNTRY HOME AND GARDEN 
I THINK THAT NOW YOU KNOW IT'S SEVENTY YEARS OLD NOW 
AND YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AT THE MOMENT IT WAS MADE IN THE THIRTIES 
WHEN THAT GREAT ARISTOCRATIC SORT OF COUNTRY HOUSE STRUCTURE WAS ACTUALLY FALLING APART 
UNDER DEMOCRACY A TAX REGIME WHATEVER YOU LIKE 
AND THIS IN A WAY COMPLETELY INTUITIVELY I THINK MODELS THE END OF A WORLD 
AND THAT IS ENORMOUSLY ATTRACTIVE TO HUGE SECTIONS OF THE POPULATION 
AS A SORT OF NOSTALGIC LOVELINESS 
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE STRANGE THINGS THAT I'VE NOTICED TODAY IS THAT ALTHOUGH SISSINGHURST 
IS DOMINATED BY ITS ARCHITECTURE OF BOTH BUILDINGS AND PLANTS PEOPLE WALK ROUND IT LIKE THIS 
THEY WALK ROUND WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN AND THEY TAKE PICTURES LIKE THAT 
AND THIS EXQUISITELY ORCHESTRATED COLLECTION OF PLANTS CHANGES ITS PERFORMANCE FROM SEASON TO SEASON 
EVEN FROM DAY TO DAY BUT THE STORY LOCKED IN THE PAST IS ALWAYS THE SAME 
AND PERHAPS ONLY GARDENS CAN DO THAT 
PERHAPS GARDENS CAN REFRESH THE PAST 
AND YET NURTURE IT IN A WAY THAT NOTHING ELSE CAN 
SISSINGHURST AND ROUSHAM ARE BOTH GARDENS HEAVY WITH BEAUTY AND HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE 
BUT I SCARCELY HAVE TIME TO DWELL ON THEM BECAUSE IMMEDIATELY I'M OFF TO CATCH THE EUROSTAR TO PARIS 
I KNEW BOTH THESE ENGLISH GARDENS OF OLD 
BUT NOW I'M ABOUT TO VISIT GARDENS THAT I HAVE ONLY SEEN IN BOOKS 
IT'S NOT JUST THEIR HORTICULTURAL BEAUTY I AM EXCITED ABOUT 
THERE WE GO 
'. I ALSO WANT TO DISCOVER WHAT THEY CAN TELL ME ABOUT NORTHERN EUROPEAN CULTURE 
OH LOOK 
I'VE BEEN BLASTED EFFORTLESSLY INTO PARIS IN UNDER TWO HOURS 
WHERE I HAVE TO CHANGE TRAINS 
IN ORDER TO GET TO MY FIRST FRENCH GARDEN DOWN IN THE LOIRE VALLEY 
I CROSSED PARIS AND CHANGED TRAINS WITH A QUICK SPOT OF SIGHTSEEING ON MY WAY 
AS I HEADED TO THE CHATEAU OF VILLANDRY AND ITS FAMOUS GARDEN 
RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE LOIRE REGION 
VILLANDRY IS ONE OF THE GRANDEST OF THE AREA'S MANY CHATEAUX 
I'VE WANTED TO SEE IT FOR YEARS BECAUSE 
LAID OUT BEHIND THIS BEAUTIFUL BUILDING IS A FAMOUS GARDEN THAT ENTHRALLED ME 
FROM THE VERY FIRST TIME I HEARD ABOUT IT 
I WAS TOLD THAT BEFORE I ACTUALLY GO INTO THE GARDEN ITSELF 
I SHOULD REALLY GO UP AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT FROM THE TOP OF THE CHATEAU'S TOWER 
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE HISTORY AND THE SIGNIFICANCE 
AND SYMBOLISM OF THIS LAYOUT AND CONFIDENTLY CAME UP HERE EXPECTING TO GIVE A LITTLE LESSON 
AND THE HONEST TRUTH IS THAT I'M ALMOST SPEECHLESS 
AT THE INCREDIBLE SCALE OF EXECUTION CONCEPT AND ABOVE ALL 
THE SCULPTURAL QUALITY 
IT'S AN IMMEDIATE VISCERAL THING 
YOU JUST DON'T GET THAT FROM PHOTOGRAPHS OR PLANS 
THIS IS A MANIPULATION OF SPACES THAT IS REALLY EXCITING 
THE EXISTING CHATEAU WAS FIRST BUILT ON THE SITE 
OF AN EARLIER FORTIFICATION BY JEAN LE BRETON BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO AND ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX 
LE BRETON HAD BEEN AN AMBASSADOR TO ITALY AND THE GARDEN THAT HE MADE AT VILLANDRY WAS ORNATE EXTENSIVE 
AND DREW ON HIS EXPERIENCES OF ITALIAN RENAISSANCE GARDENS 
THE CURRENT OWNER OF THE CHATEAU IS HENRI CARVALLO 
NOW HENRI PERHAPS YOU COULD EXPLAIN TO ME THE LAYOUT OF THE GARDEN 
I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE THIS GARDEN HERE 
IS CLEARLY FULL OF MEANING ISN'T IT 
YES OF COURSE YOU HAVE HERE THE MUSIC GARDEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOAT 
AND JUST HERE THE LOVE GARDEN WHICH IS REALLY THE EXTENSION OF THE MAIN ROOM OF THE CHATEAU 
BUT THIS WALK THAT WE'RE ON NOW THIS PLATFORM REALLY 
PRESUMABLY IS DELIBERATELY DESIGNED TO LOOK DOWN ON THE GARDENS 
AH OF COURSE AND IT'S A GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF ALL THE 
GARDENS IN VILLANDRY IS THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SEEN FROM ABOVE FIRST 
THE BEAUTY OF THIS GARDEN 
IS MOSTLY IN THE STRUCTURE AND IN THE GEOMETRY 
RATHER THAN IN THE CONTENT OF THE FRAME 
IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR THE ENTIRE FORMAL RENAISSANCE GARDEN WAS RIPPED OUT 
AND REPLACED WITH AN ENGLISH STYLE LANDSCAPE PARK LIKE ROUSHAM 
IN NINETEEN OH SIX HENRI'S GREAT GRANDPARENTS BOUGHT THE CHATEAU 
AND BEGAN THE PROCESS OF RESTORING THE GARDEN TO ITS RENAISSANCE GLORY 
QUITE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU NOW 
IT'S ALWAYS VERY NICE AND INTERESTING TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE WORK 
OF YOUR ANCESTOR AND I'M THE FOURTH GENERATION SO IT'S GOING ON QUITE WELL 
AND ALSO IT BRINGS ME ALWAYS A LOT OF JOY TO RECEIVE VISITORS 
NOW THIS IS A DRAMATIC CHANGE 
TELL ME ABOUT THIS AREA HENRI 
THIS IS THE WATER GARDEN 
THIS WAS CREATED AFTER PLANTS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND SO THE WATER GARDEN 
WHICH IS CENTRED AROUND A NICE WATER MIRROR IN THE SIDE OF THE RIVER 
IS REALLY I THINK THE MOST PEACEFUL PLACE OF THE GARDEN 
SO FAR I HAVE ONLY VIEWED THE GARDEN FROM ABOVE 
NOW I WANT TO GO DOWN AND GET RIGHT IN AMONGST IT 
DOWN AT GROUND LEVEL IN THE MUSIC GARDEN YOU CAN REALLY 
HARDLY MAKE OUT THE PATTERN EXCEPT FOR WHERE THE LAVENDER MARKS IT 
SO YOU HAVE THIS EXTRAORDINARY GREAT SLAB OF BOX HEDGE 
NOW I ASSUME THEY WOULD USE THIS MACHINE THAT THEY'RE USING 
FOR CUTTING THE HORNBEAM HEDGE AT THE BACK 
TO GET OUT OVER THE BOX AND CUT IT BECAUSE I COULDN'T THINK HOW ELSE THEY DID IT AND I ASKED HENRI 
AND HE SAID NO ACTUALLY WHAT THEY DO IS THAT THEY PART THE BOX 
WHERE TWO PLANTS MEET IN HERE AND THEN JUST CAREFULLY WALK THROUGH 
AND WADE OUT THIGH DEEP IN BOX CUT WHAT THEY CAN AND THEN MOVE ON 
AND THEN JUST PUSH IT ALL BACK TOGETHER AGAIN 
AND THAT'S SORT OF CHARMINGLY HUMAN AND SORT OF AMATEUR IN THIS 
INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE PROFESSIONAL SET UP 
THE LOWEST TERRACE OF VILLANDRY 
IS THE POTAGER AND ACTUALLY THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO COME AND SEE 
THIS IS WHY I'VE CHOSEN IT AS ONE OF MY EIGHTY GARDENS 
AND I'VE BEEN LONGING TO COME AND SEE IT FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW 
POTAGER IS TAKEN FROM THE FRENCH FOR SOUP POTAGE 
AND ESSENTIALLY THE GARDEN GROWS THE INGREDIENTS TO MAKE SOUP INCLUDING VEGETABLES AND HERBS 
BUT THERE ARE ALSO FLOWERS AND FRUIT AND ALL IS SET IN AN INTRICATELY FORMAL GEOMETRIC PATTERN 
DELINEATED WITH BOX HEDGING 
THE SCALE IS BREATHTAKING 
IN TWO ANNUAL SOWINGS THEY GROW OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND VEGETABLE PLANTS AND ANOTHER THIRTY THOUSAND OF FLOWERS 
MY VISIT IS AT THE CUSP OF TWO SEASONS SO IT IS COMPARATIVELY EMPTY 
BUT IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY THIS IS THE MOST FAMOUS POTAGER IN THE WORLD 
WELL I'VE FULFILLED A LIFETIME'S AMBITION TO VISIT VILLANDRY AND I'M NOT REMOTELY DISAPPOINTED IN FACT 
I'M OVERWHELMED AT HOW IT'S EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS 
BUT THE SURPRISING THING HAS BEEN THAT THE REASON FOR THIS PILGRIMAGE 
THE POTAGER THE VEGETABLES 
HAS NOT BEEN THE THING THAT'S BLOWN ME AWAY 
I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE REST OF THE GARDEN WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO MAGNIFICENT 
IT'S ALMOST LAND ART AND YET IT'S A HISTORICAL MONUMENT MADE WITH SUCH 
A DEGREE OF GENEROSITY AND BIG MINDEDNESS 
SO PUT ALL THAT TOGETHER IN A GARDEN 
AND YOU HAVE WHAT IS QUITE FRANKLY AN EXHILARATING PACKAGE AND I'VE ABSOLUTELY ADORED IT 
I'M HEADING OFF NOW TO ANOTHER GARDEN I HAVE LONG WANTED TO SEE 
MADE BY ONE OF FRANCE'S MOST FAMOUS PAINTERS 
THIS MEANS GOING BACK NORTH OF PARIS TO NORMANDY 
THIS NEXT GARDEN IS ABOUT AS DIFFERENT FROM VILLANDRY AS COULD BE IMAGINED 
AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY MODERN IN CONCEPT AT LEAST BECAUSE IT'S OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD NOW 
AND IT BELONGS TO THE PAINTER MONET AT GIVERNY 
THE QUEUES TO SEE THE GARDEN ARE BUILDING UP 
EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT YET OFFICIALLY OPEN 
AND I HAVE BEEN GRANTED A QUICK LOOK ROUND BEFORE THE PUBLIC ARE ALLOWED IN 
GIVERNY HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS GARDENS IN EUROPE IF NOT THE WORLD 
AND IT'S VISITED BY UP TO HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN THE SEVEN MONTHS OF THE YEAR THAT IT IS OPEN 
MONET WAS OBSESSED WITH THIS GARDEN AND PAINTED IT CONTINUOUSLY FOR FORTY YEARS UNTIL HIS DEATH IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX 
IT IS THE ARCHETYPE OF THE CREATIVE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN PAINTING AND GARDENING 
AND EVERY ASPECT OF THE GARDEN IS DRIVEN BY COLOUR AND LIGHT 
IT APPEARS LIKE THERE'S A SORT OF PAIR OF BORDERS HUGE BORDERS 
GOING UP EITHER SIDE THIS PATH 
IN FACT THEY'RE MADE UP OF A SUCCESSION OF SMALL RAISED BEDS 
EACH ONE WITH ITS OWN MINI THEME 
EACH MOUNDED UP IN A SLIGHTLY CHAOTIC ALMOST ARBITRARY PATTERN 
BUT THEN YOU START TO NOTICE THAT THE COLOURS ARE WORKING TOGETHER 
NOW IT'S BEEN SAID THAT THESE ARE LIKE AN ARTISTS' PALETTE IN THE WAY THEY'RE LAID OUT 
BUT IT SEEMS MORE TO ME LIKE THE WAY THAT A PICTURE IS BUILT UP A PAINTING 
THE OVERALL EFFECT HAS A SORT OF GENERAL THEME 
BUT THEN INDIVIDUALLY YOU START TO LOOK AT THE WAY IT'S PUT TOGETHER 
AND THE WHOLE SERIES OF LITTLE MINI EVENTS HAPPENING TO MAKE THE BIGGER PICTURE 
THIS IS A HUGE CULTURAL CHANGE IT REALLY MIGHT AS WELL BE ANOTHER COUNTRY 
I'VE LEFT THE LANGUAGE OF FORMALITY OF GREEN LAYERS AND PLAINS 
AND COME TO A COUNTRY WHERE THE CURRENCY IS COLOUR 
BUT ACTUALLY AS I WALK AROUND IT'S CLEAR THERE ARE SURPRISING CONNECTIONS 
THE LAYOUT HERE IS VERY GRID LIKE IT'S FORMAL 
IT'S JUST IT'S FUZZY IT'S A FUZZY STRUCTURE AND A FUZZY FRAMEWORK 
IN ORDER THAT COLOUR CAN BE SATURATED INTO IT 
THIS SECTION OF THE GARDEN WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL CIDER ORCHARD IS ONLY HALF OF IT 
TEN YEARS AFTER BUYING THE HOUSE MONET BOUGHT ANOTHER PLOT OF LAND 
OVER THE ROAD SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE HIS FAMOUS LILY PONDS 
JAN HUNTLEY FROM THE CLAUDE MONET FOUNDATION HAS OFFERED TO GUIDE ME ROUND THEM 
MONET PAINTED THESE LILY PONDS WITH A KIND OF SIMMERING MANIA 
HE WOULD WORK ON UP TO FIFTY DIFFERENT CANVASES AT ANY ONE TIME 
MOVING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AS HE TRIED TO CAPTURE THE SPECIFIC LIGHT AT THAT PRECISE MOMENT OF THE DAY 
BUT THE CLAUDE MONET FOUNDATION HAS MORE THAN JUST THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING LIGHT TO WORRY ABOUT TODAY 
YOU NOW HAVE WHAT UPWARD OF HALF A MILLION VISITORS A YEAR 
EXACTLY YES THEY MUST IMPOSE PROBLEMS AND RESTRICTIONS 
THAT MONET NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH AND COULDN'T HAVE DEALT WITH 
MONET'S RIVERBANKS WERE FAR MORE GRASSY AS YOU CAN SEE OVER THERE 
WE'VE PLANTED REALLY CLOSE TO THE EDGES SIMPLY TO PREVENT THE TOURISTS FROM STEPPING OVER 
IT'S NOT ONLY THAT IT'S ALSO PUBLIC PRESSURE 
THE PUBLIC EXPECT TO SEE A VERY FAMOUS GARDEN IN PERFECT CONDITION 
NOW YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE WHICH DOES MEAN THAT 
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING 
LITERALLY ON MONDAYS THE GARDENERS COME IN AND ANYTHING THAT IS NO LONGER IN GOOD SHAPE DISAPPEARS 
AND WE PUT SOMETHING ELSE IN 
I MEAN WHAT'S THE BASIC PHILOSOPHY 
DO YOU THINK WHAT WOULD MONET HAVE DONE UNDER THE SAME SITUATION 
OR DO YOU SAY WELL WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION FOR BETTER OR WORSE 
WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE 
AND THE IDEA OF WHAT WOULD MONET HAVE DONE 
DOES NOT COME INTO LINE BECAUSE MONET WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD SO MANY VISITORS 
HE WAS A VERY PRIVATE MAN 
WELL THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING 
I'VE COME AWAY WITH MIXED FEELINGS 
BECAUSE CLEARLY IF THERE'S A GARDEN THAT YOU'VE BEEN DYING TO SEE FOR A LONG TIME 
IT'S GREAT TO GO THERE 
BUT YOU RISK CHALLENGING YOUR EXPECTATIONS 
IT'S A TRICKY TIME OF YEAR IN BETWEEN AND THEY'VE HAD SOME TERRIBLE WEATHER SO 
NOT THE BEST TIME TO JUDGE IT FOR ITS COLOUR 
BUT WHAT IT DID MAKE ME REALISE WAS THAT UNLIKE ANY OTHER GARDEN I'VE SEEN 
THAT GARDEN WAS CREATED AS PART OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS TOWARDS PAINTING 
IT'S A MEANS TO AN END HOWEVER SERIOUSLY MONET TOOK THE HORTICULTURE 
AND NOW THEY'VE GOT THE JOB OF MAINTAINING THAT GARDEN IN A DEADLY PROFESSIONAL AND SERIOUS WAY 
BUT WITHOUT THAT IMPETUS OF A SINGLE FIGURE CREATING SOMETHING FROM IT 
SISSINGHURST STILL RESONATES WITH HAROLD AND VITA'S SPIRIT 
BUT GIVERNEY SEEMS EMPTIER LESS A LIVING GARDEN AND MORE A TRIBUTE TO CLAUDE MONET 
ANYWAY IT IS TIME NOW TO MOVE ON FROM GIVERNEY AND FRANCE 
BONJOUR 
MERCI 
THE THIRD COUNTRY IN THIS FIVE NATION JAUNT IS BELGIUM 
AND A GARDEN JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY OF ANTWERP 
I BOUGHT THIS LITTLE BOOK ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO JUST SPECULATIVELY 
I TOOK IT HOME AND OPENED IT UP AND WAS BLOWN AWAY 
I LOVE THE PICTURES OF THE GARDENS INSIDE WHICH SEEM TO COMBINE 
FORMALITY AND TRADITION AND YET SOMETHING THAT WAS COMPLETELY 
INNOVATIVE AND EXACTLY CHIMED WITH WHAT I LOVE ABOUT GARDENS 
AND IT'S CALLED LE JEAN AND LE JACQUES WIRTZ AND IT'S THE REASON I'M ON THIS TRAIN NOW TO ANTWERP 
TO MEET JACQUES WIRTZ AFTER ALL THESE YEARS 
JACQUES WIRTZ IS A DESIGNER WHO STRADDLES THE DIVIDE 
BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL EUROPEAN GARDEN AESTHETIC AND CONTEMPORARY GARDEN STYLE 
AND HE IS A FULLY PAID UP HERO OF MINE SO RATHER THAN VISIT ONE OF HIS CLIENTS' GARDENS 
OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY ALL OVER EUROPE 
I WENT TO MEET HIM AT HIS HOME TO SEE HIS OWN GARDEN 
I'VE SEEN PICTURES OF THIS BUT I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS SO LONG 
THIS FOUR ACRE GARDEN WAS ONCE THE WALLED GARDEN OF A GREAT ESTATE 
AND THE PATHS WERE LINED WITH BOX HEDGING 
BUT BY NINETEEN SEVENTY WHEN JACQUES BOUGHT HIS HOUSE ORIGINALLY THE GARDENER'S COTTAGE 
THIRTY YEARS OF NEGLECT HAD REDUCED THE HEDGES TO AN OVERGROWN GAPPY SPRAWL 
RATHER THAN RIPPING THEM OUT AND STARTING AFRESH 
HE USED THIS RAW MATERIAL TO MAKE HIS CLOUD HEDGES 
TRANSFORMING THEM INTO ONE OF THE GREAT HORTICULTURAL FEATURES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
IN SO MANY GARDENS THAT YOU VISIT 
THERE'S A STYLE THAT YOU CAN LATCH ONTO 
AND YOU UNDERSTAND IT AND YOU APPRECIATE IT AND THAT EXPLAINS THE GARDEN 
WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS COMPLETE FLUIDITY 
YOU'VE GOT THE LAYOUT OF A FORMAL GARDEN YOU'VE GOT NURSERY PLANTS 
THERE'S WONDERFUL FLOWERS THERE ARE VEGETABLES ALL GROWING WITHOUT BOUNDARIES 
IT CHALLENGES ALL PRECONCEPTIONS BUT ACTUALLY THE ELEMENTS ARE COMPLETELY FAMILIAR 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE ARE THESE GREAT SPECIMENS 
HOLLY BOX SOME YEW ROUND THE CORNER LIKE TREES IN A WOOD 
I MEAN THERE'S NO ATTEMPT TO MAKE IT LIKE A GARDEN 
AND IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE STORED 
THIS IS TO ME LIKE A STONE MASON'S YARD OR MAYBE AN ATTIC 
FULL OF MARVELLOUS THINGS JUST WAITING TO GO 
AND IT'S GOT ALL THE INGREDIENTS OF A FORMAL GARDEN BUT NONE OF THE SELF CONSCIOUSNESS 
AND IT'S THAT THAT MAKES IT SO MAGICAL 
THEY SAY YOU SHOULD NEVER MEET YOUR HEROES 
AND I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS BEFORE MEETING JACQUES WIRTZ 
BUT THERE WAS ALSO MUCH I WANTED TO ASK HIM 
DID YOU INTEND 
TO MAKE A GARDEN HERE OR TO USE IT AS A NURSERY 
WELL MY INTENTION WAS NOT TO MAKE A GARDEN 
TO STOCK PLANTS HERE FOR USE IN OUR FIRM FOR PLANTING OUTSIDE 
BUT PRESUMABLY THIS HEDGE HERE BEHIND YOU NOW THAT WAS ALREADY THERE AND YOU CLIPPED IT 
YES BUT NOT ONLY LARGE SHAPES 
WHY DID YOU REFORM IT IN THIS CLOUD FORMATION 
RATHER THAN IN STRAIGHT LINES IN THE EUROPEAN TRADITION 
YES THIS WAS A INSPIRATION OF THE MOMENT 
NOT TO GO BACK TO THIS TRADITIONAL WAY AND TO MAKE 
IT LIKE 
CLOUDS AND WHAT THE FRENCH NAME MOUTONNEMENT MOUTONNEMENT 
LIKE SHEEP YOU KNOW 
SOME PEOPLE MAKE COPIES OF THIS IN THEIR GARDEN 
AND IF YOU DO THAT YOU HAVE TO YOU NEED TO DO IT ON A BIG SCALE OTHERWISE IT IS YOU KNOW 
IT'S NOT GOOD 
DOES THIS GARDEN STILL PLEASE YOU AND GIVE YOU PLEASURE 
YES OH YES IT'S VERY SATISFYING 
FOR ME IT IS A PLEASURE TO EVERY MORNING TO TAKE MY BREAKFAST HERE AND 
TO LOOK AT THE GARDEN AND TO MAKE THE SHORT WALK TO THE GREENHOUSE AND SO ON NO NO I AM VERY HAPPY 
OFTEN THIS IS PARADISE FOR ME YES 
NOW IT'S OBVIOUS THAT I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS GARDEN 
AND I SUPPOSE IT RANKS AS ONE OF THE GREAT EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE 
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE SORT OF FANTASTIC ARTISTIC EXPERIENCES 
LIKE GOING TO A FILM THAT BLOWS YOU AWAY 
OR READING A NOVEL THAT CHANGES YOUR LIFE 
AND WHAT REALLY SEEMS TO BE SPECIAL ABOUT IT IS THE WAY THAT SPACE IS 
SCULPTED INTO THESE EXTRAORDINARY BEAUTIFUL OBJECTS MADE OUT OF AIR 
AND CONTAINED BY PLANTS 
AND BECAUSE THE PLANTS ARE LIVING AND CHANGING AND HAVE TO BE CLIPPED 
AND ALSO THAT THE WHOLE GARDEN IS SO FLUID IT HAS FANTASTIC DYNAMISM 
AND THAT BALANCE BETWEEN SORT OF POETIC DELICACY AND HUMAN ENERGY 
SEEMS TO BE JUST PERFECT 
THE EXHILARATION OF THAT EXPERIENCE HAS MORE THAN COMPENSATED FOR THE SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT OF GIVERNY 
AND I AM READY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STAGE OF THIS JOURNEY 
AND THE ONLY OTHER GARDEN ON THIS TRIP THAT I HAVE VISITED BEFORE 
FROM BELGIUM I CATCH ANOTHER TRAIN TO THE NETHERLANDS 
AND BACK THREE HUNDRED YEARS TO THE ROYAL GARDEN OF HET LOO IN APELDOORN 
THE LAST TIME I CAME HERE WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WHEN A FULL RESTORATION OF THE GARDEN HAD JUST BEEN COMPLETED 
I HAVE RETURNED BECAUSE THE GARDEN IS THE BEST LIVING HISTORY LESSON THAT I KNOW 
THE GARDEN WAS MADE IN THE MIDDLE OF A VAST FOREST 
WHICH WAS PRETTY MUCH UNTAMED 
NOW AT THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY FOREST OR WILDERNESS OF ANY KIND 
THAT WASN'T BEING USED FOR PRODUCTIVE PURPOSES WAS SEEN AS HOSTILE 
THERE WAS NO ROMANTIC IDEA THAT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL NATURAL WORLD IT WAS EFFECTIVELY THE ENEMY 
SO TO MAKE A GARDEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT WAS AN EXPRESSION OF MAN'S DOMINATION OVER NATURE 
WILLIAM OF ORANGE AND HIS YOUNG ENGLISH WIFE MARY CAME HERE IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR 
AND SET ABOUT CREATING A PALACE AND GARDEN IN A HIGH BAROQUE STYLE 
THAT ABOVE ALL EXPRESSED FORMALITY AND CONTROL 
THE BAROQUE EVOLVED FROM THE EARLIER RENAISSANCE STYLE BUT WAS MORE ELABORATE AND MORE THEATRICAL 
THEN IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE WILLIAM AND MARY WERE INVITED TO TAKE OVER THE ENGLISH CROWN FROM MARY'S FATHER 
THE CATHOLIC JAMES THE SECOND AND THEY MOVED TO ENGLAND 
BRINGING WITH THEM A WHOLE RANGE OF DUTCH INFLUENCES 
BUT NONE THAT WAS TO BE MORE PROFOUND THAN IN GARDENS 
SO THE GARDEN HERE AT HET LOO WHICH WAS ONLY FIVE YEARS OLD AT THAT POINT 
PROVED TO HAVE A REAL AND LASTING EFFECT ON THE LANDSCAPE OF BRITAIN 
IN FACT DETAILED ASPECTS OF HET LOO LIKE THESE GOLDEN SWANS FOUND THEIR WAY AS LEAD CASTS TO ROUSHAM 
BUT IT WAS THE GENERAL DUTCH INFLUENCE THAT WAS SOON SEEN IN GARDENS RIGHT ACROSS BRITAIN 
THESE NARROW BORDERS THAT RIBBON THE GREAT PARTERRES 
ARE NOT REALLY FLOWER BORDERS AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM AT ALL 
THEY'RE MORE LIKE OUR DISPLAYS OF SPECIMENS 
WHICH IS WHY YOU JUST GET ONE PLANT IN A ROW 
SPACED QUITE WIDELY APART BY MODERN STANDARDS ALL THE WAY ALONG 
AND THE IDEA WAS JUST TO ENJOY THEM AS THEY CAME INDIVIDUALLY 
MUCH MORE IN FACT LIKE CHINA WHICH AROUND THE TIME OF HET LOO 
WAS COLLECTED OBSESSIVELY IN A CABINET OR ON A MANTELPIECE 
I MET THE CURATOR BEN GROEN AND WALKED ROUND THE GARDEN 
ALTHOUGH THIS IS BAROQUE AND VILLANDRY IS HIGH RENAISSANCE 
THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO GARDENS IS APPARENT IN BROAD CONTENT IF NOT IN DETAIL 
AND LIKE VILLANDRY HET LOO SHARED THE INDIGNITY OF THE FORMAL GARDEN BEING SWEPT AWAY 
AND REPLACED WITH A LANDSCAPE PARK 
FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN WILLIAM AND MARY'S GARDEN WAS LOST BURIED IN THE SANDY SOIL 
BUT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY WORK BEGAN TO RECREATE THE ORIGINAL BAROQUE GARDEN BASED ON DETAILED PLANS AND ARCHAEOLOGY 
WHAT REALLY STRIKES ME ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT LOOKS 
BRAND SPANKING NEW WHICH OF COURSE IS HOW IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED 
IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TEN OR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY I. E. ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AFTER IT WAS MADE 
IS THAT DELIBERATE ARE YOU TRYING TO KEEP IT LOOKING NEW 
YES WHAT WE WANT TO GIVE IS A FROZEN IMAGE OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED 
MAN IS MASTER IN NATURE THAT IS THE MESSAGE PROBABLY SENT OUT AT THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
AT THAT TIME IT WAS THE FIRST 
FEELING THAT YES WE CAN GET IT 
WE CAN MASTER NATURE 
AND NOW WE KNOW WE CAN 
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY MILES OF HEDGING THERE IS 
IT'S ABOUT THIRTY KILOMETRES 
AND THAT IS QUITE A DISTANCE 
THEY START IN THE BEGINNING OF APRIL AND THEY GO UNTIL THE END OF JUNE 
AND THAT MEANS FOUR GARDENERS ARE BASICALLY THE WHOLE DAY IS CLIPPING 
AND THEY GO ON AND THEY GO ON 
THIS GARDEN IS MOST CERTAINLY NOT LOW MAINTENANCE 
AND TO ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE THROUGH THE QUEEN'S GARDEN 
IS WHAT MUST BE THE MOTHER AND FATHER OF ALL HEDGE TRIMMING JOBS 
THIS IS THE BURSO WHICH IS MY FAVOURITE PIECE OF THE GARDEN 
THE IDEA OF A BURSO IS TO CREATE A FRAMEWORK OUT OF WOOD 
AND IN THIS CASE MASSIVE FRAMEWORK 
AND THEN CLAD IT IN HORNBEAM FROM THE OUTSIDE WHICH 
IS THEN TRIMMED SO IT LOOKS LIKE A SOLID STRUCTURE FROM THE OUTSIDE AND YET LIGHT FILTERS THROUGH 
AND THE REASON FOR IT WAS SO THAT THE QUEEN COULD WALK PROTECTED FROM THE GLARE OF THE SUMMER SUN 
AND THE EFFECT IS TO HAVE THIS GREEN LIGHT FILTERING THROUGH TO MAKE 
I THINK ONE OF THE MOST MAGICAL PLACES IN ANY GARDEN IN THE WORLD BECAUSE YOU'RE INSIDE THE LIGHT 
YOU'RE INSIDE THE STRUCTURE OF THE HEDGE AND IT'S FRAGILE 
AND YET OF COURSE AMAZINGLY STRONG AND I ADORE IT 
BUT ACTUALLY WHETHER I LIKE IT OR NOT IS NOT THE POINT ABOUT HET LOO 
UNLIKE ANY OF THE OTHER GARDENS ON THIS TRIP THE CRITICAL THING ABOUT HET LOO IS THAT NOT ALLOWED TO AGE 
IT IS A TIME MACHINE DELIBERATELY HELD BRIGHT FRESH AND NEW AT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN HUNDRED 
AND IN GARDEN TERMS WHAT YOU HAVE HERE AT HET LOO IS THE MOULD 
THAT FORTY YEARS LATER WILLIAM KENT WAS TO SHATTER AT ROUSHAM 
LEAVING HET LOO IT'S TIME TO POP ONTO ANOTHER TRAIN BACK TO AMSTERDAM 
I'VE GOT A FEW PICTURES ON HERE OF THE NEXT GARDEN 
THAT I'M VISITING 
NOW IT'S DESIGNED BY A MAN CALLED PIET OUDOLF WHO I'VE MET A COUPLE OF TIMES IN ENGLAND 
HE DID A GOLD MEDAL WINNING GARDEN AT CHELSEA A FEW YEARS AGO 
AND HE'S ONE OF THE LEADING EXPONENTS OF WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL THE NEW PERENNIAL GARDEN 
WHICH USES GRASSES TO A VERY GREAT DEGREE 
AND THIS GARDEN 
IS SUPPOSED TO BE A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE 
OF A MODERN EUROPEAN GARDEN 
I MEAN CLEARLY IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THIS IS A HIGHLY DESIGNED GARDEN 
IT'S A DESIGNER SET PIECE 
NONE THE WORSE FOR THAT THAT'S NOT A CRITICISM 
AND BASED AROUND THIS SLAB OF WATER WHICH I GUESS IF IT WASN'T STARTING TO RAIN RATHER UNCOMFORTABLY 
WE'VE DODGED THE WEATHER MOST OF THIS WEEK WOULD REFLECT THE SKY 
AND THEN YOU'D HAVE THESE VERY CRISP LINES 
I LIKE THE WAY THAT THE GARDEN IS SORT OF ANCHORED BY GREAT SLABS OF WATER AND BED AND HEDGE 
AND THEN GENTLY SOFTENS 
FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS TRIP I'M IN A GARDEN WHERE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DESIGNED FROM SCRATCH 
AND LUCKILY PIET OUDOLF HAS AGREED TO COME ALONG AND TALK TO ME ABOUT HIS WORK 
DO YOU THINK THERE IS A SORT OF EUROPEAN PARTICULARLY A NORTHERN EUROPEAN 
GARDENING LANGUAGE OR STYLE 
MORE IN THE PLANTING I SUPPOSE NOWADAYS 
IT ER 
IT'S MORE ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY YOU KNOW THE WORD 
IT'S ALMOST FASHIONABLE BUT WE TRY TO CREATE GARDENS THAT LAST LONGER 
TRY TO FIND THE PLANTS THAT WORK BETTER 
NOW HERE YOU'VE USED GRASSES TO HUGE EFFECT 
IS THAT PART OF THAT PROCESS 
NO GRASSES I THINK ARE PART OF THE WAY I LIKE TO WORK 
I THINK IT CREATES A SORT OF SPONTANEITY A SORT OF NATURAL HOLISTIC LOOK 
AND THAT WAS HOW IT ALL STARTED 
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND GRASSES TEND TO NEED LESS WATER AND TEND TO BE EASY IF YOU USE THE RIGHT ONES 
AND THEY MATCH VERY WELL WITH THE PLANTS I LIKE 
WHICH PLANTS DO YOU LIKE 
PLANTS THAT LOOK VERY COME VERY CLOSE TO THE NATURAL SPECIES 
AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE GRASSES SO MUCH BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE BIG FLOWERS AND OVER CULTIVATED PLANTS 
WHERE DO YOU SEE GARDEN DESIGN TAKING US IN THE FUTURE 
I THINK WE CAN FIND A WAY THAT WE CAN WHERE ECOLOGY MEETS DESIGN 
SO YOU CAN LOOK FOR THE PLANTS THAT GROW WELL ON THE SITE WHERE YOU ARE BUSY 
AND WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO WATER THREE TIMES A DAY SO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE FUTURE 
I TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF A PUNT WITH THIS GARDEN BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I'D HEARD IT WAS REALLY GOOD 
YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW WITH A PRIVATE GARDEN 
BUT I'M JOLLY GLAD I DID COME BECAUSE I THINK IT IS GOOD 
REMEMBER WE'RE ONLY ABOUT HALF AN HOUR FROM THE MIDDLE OF AMSTERDAM 
AND YET YOU HAVE A GARDEN THAT'S PRIVATE IT'S DOMESTIC AND YET IT'S OPEN OUT TO THE LANDSCAPE 
AND I'M SURE THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE FUTURE OF GARDENING 
IT MUST RELATE TO THE SURROUNDINGS AND RELATE TO THE REALITIES OF MODERN LIFE 
SO ON EVERY LEVEL IT'S BEEN A REALLY GOOD TRIP 
I'VE COME TO THE END OF THE FAMILIAR ASPECTS OF EUROPE 
AND GARDENS THAT I'VE CERTAINLY KNOWN OF IF NOT ACTUALLY VISITED BEFORE 
BUT BEFORE I FINISH I WANT TO GO OUT OF MY EUROPEAN COMFORT ZONE 
AND GO AS FAR NORTH AS POSSIBLE WHERE THERE STILL MIGHT BE A GARDEN TO SEE 
SO FOR THE FINAL STAGE I TAKE A PLANE FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS TRIP 
TO GO TO THE ISLAND OF TROMSO IN THE FAR NORTH OF NORWAY 
AND AFTER WEEKS OF CONSTANT RAIN AND GREY CLOUD I FIND BRIGHT SUNSHINE 
ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT BECAUSE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR UP HERE IN MIDSUMMER THE SUN NEVER SETS 
THIS IS TAKING SOME GETTING USED TO 
I'VE COME ONE PLANE HOP TO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND IT REALLY DOES FEEL LIKE ANOTHER WORLD 
HERE WE ARE WITH SNOW ON THE MOUNTAINS THE BRIGHTEST SUNSHINE YOU CAN IMAGINE 
I MEAN IT'S JUST ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE WITHOUT DARK GLASSES 
IT'S HOT MUCH HOTTER THAN IT WAS IN MAINLAND GREY RAINY EUROPE 
AND THERE'S PERPETUAL LIGHT 
IT'S LIGHT ALL NIGHT LONG IT'S AS BRIGHT AS THIS 
AND YET I KNOW THAT THERE IS THE FLIPSIDE WHICH IS THIS PERPETUAL DARKNESS IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER 
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY VERY DIFFERENT 
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE IS ALL THOSE ELEMENTS OF NORTHERN EUROPE 
STRETCHED OUT TO THE VERY LIMITS THAT THEY'LL GO 
I HAVE TO PINCH MYSELF TO REMEMBER THAT TROMSO IS IN FACT TWO HUNDRED MILES 
INSIDE THE ARCTIC CIRCLE AND IS COVERED BY SNOW FOR SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR 
I AM FASCINATED TO DISCOVER WHAT IT IS LIKE TO GARDEN WITH THESE EXTREMES OF LIGHT AND DARK 
AND OF SUMMER AND WINTER CLIMATES 
IF EVER GARDENING WAS ON THE EDGE IT IS SO UP HERE 
BUT AS I COME INTO THE WORLD'S MOST NORTHERLY BOTANIC GARDEN 
THROUGH ITS WOODLAND PARK IT IS CLEAR THAT THE RESTRICTED GROWING SEASON HAS SURPRISING BENEFITS 
EVERYTHING HERE HAS A FRESHNESS LIKE THE VERY BEST OF AN EARLY ENGLISH MAY DAY 
BUT BATHED IN INTENSE MIDSUMMER LIGHT 
WHICH IS A GLORIOUS COMBINATION AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE 
THIS IS A COMPLETE SURPRISE 
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT I HAD EXPECTED ACTUALLY BUT IT WASN'T THIS 
IT WAS MUCH MORE A QUESTION OF HARSH WEATHER AND TINY PLANTS CLINGING TO THE ROCKS 
YET I'VE WALKED THROUGH THIS MARVELLOUS FLOWER FILLED WOOD 
THE HEDGEROWS AND THE SIDES OF THE ROADS ARE SMOTHERED WITH FLOWERS 
AND HERE YOU COME INTO THE BOTANIC GARDEN 
WITH BRIGHT COLOUR AND THERE ARE THE MOUNTAINS COVERED IN SNOW AND THE FJORD 
WHICH IS A DELIGHTFUL SURPRISE 
THE TROMSO BOTANIC GARDENS HOUSES A WIDE RANGE OF ALPINE SPECIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD 
COLLECTED INTO GEOGRAPHIC GROUPS AND PLANTED IN AMONGST THE BOULDERS AND ROCKS THROUGHOUT THE GARDEN 
THESE COVER A SURPRISING RANGE OF SHAPES AND SIZES FROM THE POSITIVELY LUSTY TO THE MINUTE AND DELICATE 
WHAT THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON IS THEIR ADAPTATION TO THESE SURROUNDINGS 
AND ALL ARE COMPLETELY AT HOME IN THIS MOST EXTREME OF GARDEN ENVIRONMENTS 
ARVE ELVEBAKK IS THE CURATOR HERE AT TROMSO AND HE SPECIALISES IN ARCTIC PLANTS 
ONE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS YOU'RE OPEN I BELIEVE ALL THE TIME 
YES ALL DAYS OF THE YEAR 
AND NOT JUST ALL DAYS BUT ALL DAY TOO 
YOU CAN COME HERE AT TWO THREE IN THE MORNING CAN'T YOU 
YES YES PEOPLE DO REALLY 
THAT'S QUITE EXTRAORDINARY 
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A GARDEN SO FAR NORTH 
WELL IT'S THANKS TO THE GULF STREAM 
WE ARE NORTH OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE BUT WE DON'T HAVE AN ARCTIC CLIMATE 
WE ARE SURROUNDED BY FORESTS AND I HAVE VISITED GREENLAND AT THE SAME LATITUDE 
AND IT'S LIKE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WORLD 
THEY HAVE TWO THREE DEGREES IN SUMMER AND ICE AND POLAR BEARS AND WALRUS 
AND ARE FAR TO THE NORTH OF THE FOREST 
SO IF WE HAD CHANGED PLACE IF THE GULF STREAM WOULD STOP 
WE WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM 
THERE IS TALK OF THAT HAPPENING ISN'T THERE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 
YES THEY DISCUSS IF THERE IS A BALANCE AND THE OCEANOGRAPHERS SAY 
THAT OH WE THINK IT WILL LAST AT LEAST FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE 
SO I HOPE THEY ARE RIGHT 
THE WARMTH OF THE GULF STREAM MEANS THAT IT'S NOT JUST ALPINE PLANTS 
THAT CAN THRIVE IN THIS FURTHEST OUTREACH OF EUROPE 
BRYNHILD MORKVED IS WORKING ON A COLLECTION OF MORE FAMILIAR PLANTS 
MAINLY GATHERED FROM LOCAL HOUSEHOLDS 
AND THESE TELL A UNIQUE GARDENING STORY FROM NORTHERN NORWAY 
THIS IS THE GREEN CULTURAL HERITAGE OF NORTHERN NORWAY 
THE PLANTS THAT THE OLD WOMEN HAD HAD IN THEIR GARDENS FOR 
HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
THE COLOUR OF THIS RANUNCULUS IS INCREDIBLE 
I MEAN THESE BRIGHT GOLDEN BUTTONS 
YES FIFTY YEARS AGO YOU COULD FIND IT IN DIFFERENT GARDENS IN THE WHOLE OF NORWAY 
BUT NOW IT HAS DISAPPEARED FROM ALL THE OTHER PLACES 
BUT WHY HAS IT DISAPPEARED IT'S A FIELD FORM OF A WEED 
YES A WEED THEY PERHAPS HAVE CLEARED IT AWAY THEY JUST WEED IT OUT 
WE HAVE IN WHOLE OF NORWAY OF THAT PLANT 
IT MUST BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO GARDEN IN THIS CLIMATE 
PEOPLE FROM OTHER PLACES OF THE WORLD THEY THINK NOTHING GROWS IN THE NORTH 
I ALSO THOUGHT THAT WHEN I COME TO TROMSO AND THEN IT WAS VERY BIG 
FLOWERS AND VERY BEAUTIFUL SO AND I THINK 
PEOPLE THAT ARE AT THE BORDER FOR GROWING THEY WANT TO TRY TO 
OH I WANT TO TRY THIS PLANT AND I WANT TO TRY THIS PLANT 
I CONFESS THAT BOTANIC GARDENS DON'T ALWAYS THRILL ME 
BUT TO PUT PLANTS IN CONTEXT AND TO SEE THEM GROWING 
IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT ESPECIALLY ONE AS EXTREME AS THIS IS REALLY INSPIRING 
AND IT FEELS APPROPRIATE TO FINISH THIS JOURNEY AS FAR FROM WHERE I BEGAN AS POSSIBLE 
AS THOUGH ANY FURTHER AND THE VERY NOTION OF A GARDEN WOULD FALL OFF THE EDGE OF THE WORLD 
I'VE COME UP THIS HILL JUST OUTSIDE TROMSO 
LITERALLY TO GIVE MYSELF A LITTLE BIT OF DISTANCE ON THIS TRIP AND TO TAKE STOCK 
BECAUSE DOWN THERE IS THIS TOWN TWO HUNDRED MILES INTO THE ARCTIC CIRCLE 
BEHIND ME IS THE MIDNIGHT SUN 
IT LITERALLY IS MIDNIGHT THIS BRIGHT LIGHT 
WHICH IS THE SUN SKIRTING OVER THE ARCTIC AND BEYOND THERE'S NOTHING 
NO MORE GARDENS HARDLY ANY MORE PEOPLE AT ALL 
JUST THE FROZEN WASTE FOR MOST OF THE YEAR 
I BEGAN THIS JOURNEY WONDERING HOW GARDENS CAN BEST SERVE HISTORY 
CERTAINLY GARDENS CAN BRING THE PAST ALIVE IN THE MOST VIVID WAY POSSIBLE 
BECAUSE UNLIKE A BUILDING OR A PAINTING 
THE COMPONENTS ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING 
BUT AS MY JOURNEY PROGRESSED I BEGAN TO REALISE THAT WHATEVER 
THEIR HISTORY HOWEVER POWERFUL THE CULT OF PERSONALITY BEHIND THE GARDEN 
THE GARDENS OF NORTHERN EUROPE SEEMED ALL TO BE SHAPED MOST BY LIGHT OR THE LACK OF IT 
HOW THE NORTHERN EUROPEAN GARDENS SCULPT REFLECT HARNESS OR PLAY WITH THE AVAILABLE LIGHT 
IS THE CREATIVE BOND THAT RUNS DOWN THROUGH ALL THE YEARS 
AND TO COME HERE A PLACE OF PERPETUAL SUNLIGHT IN THE SUMMER 
AND ITS FLIPSIDE PERPETUAL DARK IN THE WINTER 
TAKES THAT NORTHERN EUROPEAN OBSESSION WITH LIGHT TO ITS EXTREMES AND I CAN GO NO FURTHER 
JOIN ME NEXT TIME AS I TRAVEL EAST 
TO EXPERIENCE THE DIVERSE CULTURAL INFLUENCES OF SOUTH EAST ASIA 
ON A QUEST TO FIND THE REAL TROPICAL GARDEN 
YOU'VE BEEN THE ONE TO BEAT 
THERE IS NO COMPETITION 
NO ONE'S GONNA MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME 
DING DING ROUND TWO 
WHICH IS BETTER THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT 
THE BIGGEST NAMES IN BRITISH T. V. GO HEAD TO HEAD
