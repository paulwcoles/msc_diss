PAST WE HEAR FROM THE FATHER OF 
ONE MAN AFFECTED 
HE LOST HIS GRIP ON REALITY HE HAD 
DELUSIONS HE BECAME DIFFICULT TO 
MANAGE MANAGE ALSO ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME THE 
DRAMATIC RESCUE OF THE WOUNDED IN 
BURMA BUT MANY AID AGENCIES SAY 
THEY CAN'T GET INTO HELP WE WILL 
HAVE THE LATEST OF THE MOMENT THE 
CYCLONE STRUCK 
THE HIGH FLYING LAWYER SHOT DEAD BY 
POLICE MARKSMEN BUT WHAT LED HIM 
TO TURN A GUN ON OFFICERS AND HIS 
OWN NEIGHBOURS 
AND THE BIGGEST LAND SLIP IN ONE HUNDRED 
YEARS IT SENDS FOSSIL HUNTERS 
SCURRYING TO DORSET'S JURASSIC 
COAST COAST ON B. B. C. LONDON BORIS BANS BOOZE ON 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT BUT A UNION SAYS 
IT'S COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE AND 
OUTRAGE AS THE AXE FALLS ON ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OF 
THE CAPITAL'S POST OFFICES 
GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE B. B. C. 
NEWS AT SIX O'CLOCK THE GOVERNMENT IS TO 
RECLASSIFY CANNABIS AS A MORE 
HARMFUL DRUG REJECTING THE ADVICE 
OF ITS OWN INDEPENDENT EXPERTS THE 
HOME SECRETARY JACQUI SMITH SAYS 
THE DRUG WILL BE UPGRADED FROM 
CLASS C. THAT'S THE LOWEST 
CLASSIFICATION TO CLASS B. SHE 
TOLD M. P.'S THAT MOST CANNABIS IS NOW 
SOLD IN THE FORM OF SKUNK AND THAT 
IS THREE TIMES STRONGER THAN IN THE 
PAST HERE IS DANIEL SANDFORD 
FOUR DECADES NOW THE POTENTIAL 
DANGERS OF CANNABIS HAVE TESTED 
BRITAIN'S LAWYER MAKERS LONG TERM 
USER AND CANNABIS CAMPAIGNER CHRIS 
BALDWIN THINKS THE DRUG SHOULD BE 
LEGAL BUT HE IS FIGHTING A LOSING 
BATTLE A DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT COMES 
FROM MO VIANCOURT WHOSE TEENAGE SON 
SUFFERED A PSYCHOTIC EPISODE 
BECAUSE OF THE DRUG 
HE LOST HIS 
GRIP ON REALITY HE HAD DELUSIONS 
HE BECAME DIFFICULT TO MANAGE 
STORIES LIKE THAT HAVE LED 
MINISTERS TO REVERSE THE 
DOWNGRADING OF CANNABIS WHAT'S 
MORE HERE AT THE FORENSIC SCIENCE 
SERVICE THEY SAY THE DRUG IS NOW 
TWO OR THREE TIMES STRONGER THAT'S 
BECAUSE MOST OF IT IS SKUNK 
SUPERSTRENGTH VERSION OFTEN GROWN 
INDOORS HERE IN THE U. K. 
THERE IS A 
COMPELLING CASE FOR US TO ACT NOW 
RATHER THAN RISK THE FUTURE HEALTH 
OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHERE THERE IS A 
CLEAR AND SERIOUS PROBLEM BUT 
DOUBT ABOUT THE POTENTIAL HARM THAT 
WILL BE CAUSED WE MUST ERR ON THE 
SIDE OF CAUTION AND PROTECT THE 
PUBLIC 
THERE ARE THREE OFFICIAL PUBLIC CATEGORIES OF DRUGS AT THE TOP END 
CLASS A INCLUDES COCAINE AND HEROIN 
BELOW THAT COME B. AND C. IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
CANNABIS WAS MOVED DOWN INTO CLASS 
C. WITH DRUGS LIKE VALIUM AND 
STEROIDS IT WILL NOW MOVE BACK TO 
CLASS B. WHERE IT WILL JOIN 
AMPHETAMINES OR SPEED 
BUT HAVE THE DANGERS OF CANNABIS 
BEEN EXAGGERATED IT CERTAINLY 
SIMPLE TO GET HOLD OF TO SHOW HOW 
EASY IT IS TO BUY CANNABIS IN SOME 
PARTS OF LONDON WE HAVE COME TO 
CAMDEN ON AN EARLY SUMMER EVENING 
WITH A HIDDEN CAMERA 
I HAVE SKUNK 
WITHIN MINUTES OUR 
RESEARCHER WAS BEING OFFERED SKUNK 
HOW MUCH 
I DON'T WANT TO PAY TWENTY 
GIVE ME FIFTEEN 
CANNABIS USE HAS BEEN 
FALLING IN ADULTS AND SCHOOL 
CHILDREN AND THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN 
EXPERTS TODAY SAID THAT MENTAL 
HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE RARE THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY UNUSUAL YOU WOULD NEED TO 
PREVENT FIVE THOUSAND YOUNG MALES FROM 
TAKING CANNABIS TO STOP ONE CASE OF 
SCHIZOPHRENIA AND FOR WOMEN IT WILL 
BE TWENTY THOUSAND TO STOP ONE CASE VERY VERY RECOMMENDED CANNABIS SHOULD STAY 
WHERE IT IS IN CLASS C. BUT 
MINISTERS JUST IGNORED THEM THE 
POLICE ARE PLEASED AFTER SEEING A 
HUGE GROWTH IN CANNABIS BEING GROWN 
ILLEGALLY BY ORGANISED CRIME BUT 
MANY OTHER EXPERTS ARE BAFFLED 
SAYING THE GOVERNMENT HAS PERFORMED 
AN UNNECESSARY U. TURN DANIEL IS 
HERE NOW WHY DID THE GOVERNMENT 
ASK FOR THE ADVICE OF EXPERTS AND 
IGNORE IT 
IT IS ODD TO APPOINT A 
PANEL OF EXPERTS AND COMPLETELY 
IGNORE THEIR ADVICE BUT WHAT YOU 
ARE SEEING IS THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE CAUTION OF SCIENTISTS 
WHO WANT EVERYTHING BASED ON 
EVIDENCE AND THE CONCERNS OF 
MINISTERS WHO ARE LOOKING TO THE 
FUTURE AND WHAT THEY'VE NOTICED IS 
THIS EVER INCREASING STRENGTH IN 
CANNABIS PARTICULARLY SKUNK AND 
THIS POSSIBLE LINK TO THINGS LIKE 
SCHIZOPHRENIA AND WHAT THEY'RE 
SEEING IS A MENTAL HEALTH TIMEBOMB 
WHAT MINISTERS ALSO HAVE TO WORRY 
ABOUT OF COURSE IS PUBLIC OPINION 
WELL ADMITTEDLY THE PUBLIC ARE 
CONFUSED AND THAT'S PARTLY THE 
GOVERNMENT'S FAULT AND ALSO THE 
FAULT OF SOME NEWSPAPERS BUT ON 
THIS THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE 
HOME SECRETARY JACQUI SMITH THINK 
THEY DO HAVE VOTERS' SUPPORT THANK THANK YOU YOU FOREIGN AID IS BEGINNING TO REACH 
THE AREAS OF BURMA DEVASTATED BY A 
CYCLONE BUT MANY RELIEF AGENCIES 
ARE STILL WAITING FOR PERMISSION TO 
GET IN AND HELP VAST SWATHES OF 
THE COUNTRY ARE STILL UNDER WATER 
THESE LATEST PICTURES TAKEN BY NASA 
SHOW THE POSITION BEFORE AND AFTER 
THAT HUGE TIDAL WAVE HIT THE 
IRRAWADDY DELTA WHERE THOUSANDS 
ARE FEARED DEAD 
ANDREW HARDING REPORTS 
A HANDFUL OF SURVIVORS ARE PLUCKED 
FROM THE MUD AND THE MISERY DAY 
FIVE OF BURMA'S CATASTROPHE AND 
THE RESCUE OPERATION IS STILL 
DESPERATELY SLOW VAST AREAS REMAIN 
UNDER WATER SO FAR ONLY A FEW 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAVED FROM THE 
MOST ISOLATED AREAS ON THE GROUND 
DEAD CATTLE AND AN INCREASINGLY 
DESPERATE SEARCH FOR CLEAN DRINKING 
WATER AND FOOD 
DESPERATE SEARCH FOR CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND FOOD 
DEAD BODIES LYING 
ON THE GROUND AND ALSO A DEAD BODY 
ON THE RIVER FLOATING SO THEY WERE 
QUITE DESPERATE AND THEY DON'T KNOW 
HOW TO DESCRIBE THEIR FEELING AND 
THEY WERE QUITE 
THEY WERE QUITE 
THEY WERE QUITE IN SOME AREAS WE KNOW THE AREA IS 
COMPLETELY STILL UNDER WATER UNDER 
SALT SALT WATER AND DRINKING WATER 
AND FOOD IS SOME PEOPLE HAVE NO 
DRINKING WATER AND FOOD UNLESS UNLESS ASSISTANCE GETS TO TO THOSE AREAS 
VERY SOON THE DEATH TOLL WILL RISE 
WE ARE STILL THINKING POSITIVELY 
THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO REACH 
EVERYONE BUT IT'S A RACE AGAINST 
TIME AT THE MOMENT 
THIS IS WHAT CAUSED IT ALL THE 
LATEST PICTURES TO EMERGE FROM 
BURMA OF SATURDAY'S TROPICAL 
CYCLONE TODAY IN THE STORM 
BATTERED CITY OF RANGOON SOME 
DISTRICTS ARE FINALLY GETTING CLEAN 
WATER AND OTHER BASICS LOCAL 
STOCKS OF AID ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED 
BUT THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES ARE 
CLEARLY OVERWHELMED LACKING THE 
HEAVY MACHINERY AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
TO SPEED THINGS UP MORE FOREIGN 
AID IS GETTING THROUGH BUT RED 
TAPE IN THIS RECLUSIVE NATION IS 
CAUSING GROWING FRUSTRATION IT MAY 
ALREADY BE COSTING LIVES 
IT IS AN 
ISOLATED COUNTRY AS YOU KNOW ONE 
OF THE MOST ISOLATED ON EARTH WE 
BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
EVERYTHING THEY'VE SAID SO FAR 
RECOGNISES THIS IS A MASSIVE 
HUMANITARIAN CHALLENGE AND WE ARE 
HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL GET THEIR CO 
OPERATION ON THAT WE NEED THE 
FLOODGATES TO OPEN IF YOU LIKE 
ANOTHER LONE BURMESE HELICOPTER 
BRINGS IN SUPPLIES TO THE FLOODED 
DELTA IT'S START BUT THIS 
DISASTER IS ON SCALE TO MATCH THE 
TSUNAMI IT NEEDS AN ARMY OF BOATS 
AND HELICOPTERS TO SAVE THE 
SURVIVORS SURVIVORS HERE THERE IS MAJOR POLITICAL 
ROW TONIGHT OVER THE GOVERNMENT'S 
POSITION ON REFERENDUM ON 
SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE THE LABOUR 
LEADER IN SCOTLAND WENDY ALEXANDER 
SAID AT THE WEEKEND SHE DIDN'T FEAR 
THE VERDICT OF THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE 
AND TO BRING IT ON TODAY GORDON 
BROWN DENIED SHE WAS CALLING FOR AN 
EARLY REFERENDUM 
THE P. M. AND WENDY ALEXANDER THE 
LABOUR PARTY'S LEADER IN SCOTLAND 
UNTIL NOW SHE HAD BEEN ONE OF 
GORDON BROWN'S MOST LOYAL BACKERS 
BUT HAVING CALLED FOR A VOTE ON 
SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE IS SHE NOW A 
LIABILITY HE FACED M. P.'S TODAY 
AFTER LAST WEEK'S HAMMERING IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES BUT TROUBLE WAS 
BREWING FROM NORTH OF THE BORDER 
LABOUR'S LEADER IN SCOTLAND WENDY 
ALEXANDER SAYS THERE SHOULD BE A 
REFERENDUM NOW ON SCOTTISH 
INDEPENDENCE DOES HE AGREE WITH 
HER 
THAT IS NOT WHAT SHE HAS SAID HER ARE YOU SURE MR. BROWN HERE SHE WAS 
ON SUNDAY 
I DON'T FEAR THE VERDICT 
OF THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE YOUR DECISION TO CALL FOR 
A REFERENDUM YES 
HE IS AND HE HAS YES TOLD YOU THAT YES 
THE PRIME YES MINISTER THOUGH WOULDN'T HAVE IT 
HE SAID SHE WAS ACCUSING THE S. N. P. OF 
BREAKING THEIR PROMISE SOMETHING 
THEY DENY WHAT REFERENDUM UNTIL 
WANT TO POSTPONE A REFERENDUM UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TEN 
BUT LATER SHE WAS STICKING TO TWO THOUSAND TEN HER GUNS CALLING FOR A VOTE SOONER 
RATHER THAN LATER 
I THINK THE 
IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR SCOTLAND IS 
THAT THE S. N. P. BRING FORWARD THEIR 
PROPOSALS AND GIVE SCOTLAND A 
CHOICE 
AFTER A KICKING FROM CHOICE ENGLAND AND WALES LAST WEEK THE 
LAST THING GORDON BROWN NEEDS HERE 
AT WESTMINSTER IS FLACK FROM HIS 
OWN SCOTTISH TURF LAIN LABOUR'S 
ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST A SCOTTISH 
REFERENDUM BY CALLING FOR SUCH A 
VOTE WHATEVER THE TIME SCALE SHE 
WANTS WENDY ALEX ALEXANDER HAS 
SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING HER BOSS IN AN 
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE POSITION EITHER EITHER HE IS MISREPRESENTING HER OR SHE IS 
MISREPRESENTING HIM OR THEY'RE BOTH 
MISREPRESENTING EACH OTHER THE 
BEST THAT YOU CAN SAY IS CONFUSION 
AND DISARRAY THE WORST I SUPPOSE 
IS THEY'RE TRYING TO BE ECONOMICAL 
WITH THE TRUTH 
DAVID CAMERON HAS 
WRITTEN TO THE PRIME MINISTER 
ASKING HIM TO CLARIFY THE CONFUSION 
LABOUR NORTH AND SOUTH MIGHT CLAIM 
TO AGREE BUT THE OPPOSITION HAS NO 
PLANS TO LET THIS DROP 
NEIGHBOURS OF A PROMINENT DIVORCE 
LAWYER HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING HOW 
THEY RAN FOR COVER AS HE OPENED 
FIRE ON POLICE MARKSMEN WHO 
SURROUNDED HIS HOME IN LONDON MARK 
SANDERS SAUNDERS WHO WORKED AS A 
BARRISTER WAS SHOT DEAD AFTER A 
STANDOFF LASTING FIVE HOURS 
THIRTY TWO YEARS OLD A HIGH FLYING 
BARRISTER LIVING AMONG THE RICH 
AND SUCCESSFUL BUT JUST OVER TWENTY FOUR 
HOURS AGO SOMETHING SNAPPED IN MARK 
SAUNDERS AND IT LED HIM INTO AN 
ARMED CONFRONTATION WITH THE POLICE 
WHEN OFFICERS ARRIVED AT HIS HOME 
IN ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST 
NEIGHBOURHOODS IN THE CAPITAL THEY 
FOUND HIM FIRING A SHOTGUN FROM AN 
UPSTAIRS WINDOW A STANDOFF 
FOLLOWED WHICH LASTED FIVE HOURS I I SAW THE POLICE GOING INTO THE HOUSE 
L. HAVE NOW WORKED OUT BACKS ON TO 
THE PROPERTY THE GUNMAN WAS IN TEN 
MINUTES AFTER THAT SIX MAYBE SEVEN 
DEFINITE LOUD BANGS VERY 
DELIBERATE BANG BANG BANG ONE 
AFTER ANOTHER AFTER THAT THERE WAS 
SILENCE 
IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR SILENCE WHETHER MR. SAUNDERS WAS KILLED BY A 
POLICE BULLET OR ONE OF HIS OWN 
RESIDENTS WHO REMEMBER HIM WITH HIS 
PARTNER ARE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF 
WHAT HAPPENED 
THEY MOVED IN NOT 
THAT LONG AGO AND I WOULD SEE THEM 
FROM MY WINDOW BECAUSE THEY'RE 
WE ARE NOT THAT FAR FROM EACH OTHER 
BUT I HAD NO IDEA WHO THEY WERE 
WHO THEY ARE I NEVER HEARD YELLING 
SCREAMING FROM THEM 
AS A 
SUCCESSFUL BARRISTER MARK SAUNDERS 
WOULD HAVE FELT AT HOME IN THIS 
EXCLUSIVE PART OF LONDON SO THE 
INVESTIGATION WILL WANT TO TRY AND 
FIND OUT WHY IT WAS HE TOOK OUT A 
GUN AND STARTED FIRING 
INDISCRIMINATELY AT HIS NEIGHBOURS 
A FIREARM WAS RECOVERED FROM THE 
ADDRESS AND I AM LED TO BELIEVE 
THAT IT WAS LAWFULLY HELD LEGALLY 
IN THE POSSESSION OF THE PERSON TO 
WHOM THE CERTIFICATE WAS ISSUED 
THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS MR. SAUNDERS 
WAS DRINKING HEAVILY YESTERDAY AND 
THAT HE DID HAVE PROBLEMS IN HIS 
PERSONAL LIFE THOSE MAY PROVIDE 
CLUES AS TO WHY A MAN DESCRIBED AS 
MATURE AND UNFLAPPABLE DECIDED IN 
A GUNFIGHT AT HIS HOME 
EARLY ABORTIONS COULD BE SAFELY 
CARRIED OUT IN SMALL CLINICS RATHER 
THAN HOSPITALS ACCORDING TO 
RESEARCH PUBLISHED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT THE PILOT STUDY 
SUGGESTS THAT CLINICS IN THE 
COMMUNITY OR IN DOCTORS' SURGEONS 
COULD OFFER A SAFE SERVICE WOMEN 
WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH 
THE FAMILIES OF FOURTEEN BRITISH 
SERVICEMEN KILLED WHEN THEIR NIMROD 
CRASHED IN AFGHANISTAN TWO YEARS 
AGO HAVE HEARD A RECORDING OF THEIR 
LAST MOMENTS IT WAS PLAYED AT THE 
INQUEST INTO THEIR DEATHS THE 
BOSSES OF HEATHROW'S NEW TERMINAL FIVE 
HAVE BEEN TOLD BY M. P. THAT IS THE 
OPENING OF THE BUILDING WAS A 
NATIONAL HUMILIATION 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BRITISH 
AIRPORTS AUTHORITIES WERE BEING 
GRILLED BY THE COMMONS TRANSPORT 
COMMITTEE AND ONE OF THE M. P.'S SAID 
THEY HAD MADE A FOOL OUT OF THE U. K. 
HERE IS OUR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT 
TOM SYMONDS 
HOW DID TERMINAL FIVE GO FROM THIS TO 
THIS 
SPEAK TO THE MANAGER 
IN THIS MATTER OF HOURS 
THIS AFTERNOON M. P.'S HAD IN FRONT OF 
THEM THE AIRLINE AND THE AIRPORT 
REPRESENTED BY THE B. A. A. CHAIRMAN SIR 
NIGEL RUDD 
HAVE YOU EVER OVERSEEN 
A PROJECT WHICH HAS BEEN SUCH A 
NATIONAL HUMILIATION AS THE OPENING 
OF T. FIVE 
I HAVE TO SAY NO THE THE BRITISH AIRWAYS BOSS WAS ALSO IN 
FOR A SWEATY AFTERNOON 
IS IT O. K. IF 
I TAKE MY JACKET OFF 
BY ALL MEANS 
HE TOLD THEM THERE WERE PARKING 
SECURITY AND BAGGAGE PROBLEMS BUT 
CONSTRUCTION DELAYS MEANT DOING 
LESS TESTING BEFORE OPENING DAY AND 
LESS STAFF TRAINING 
WE WERE 
SHOWING THEM AROUND A BUILDING THAT 
WAS DIFFERENT WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN 
ON DAY ONE IF YOU PUT A STAFF 
MEMBER IN UNIFORM IN A BRAND NEW 
ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE WHO ENCOUNTERTHE 
STAFF EXPECT THEM TO KNOW MORE AND 
I REGRET THAT WE PUT OUR PEOPLE IN 
THAT POSITION 
BUT BOTH THE AIRLINE 
AND THE AIRPORT INSISTED THEY HAD 
NO WARNING THERE WOULD BE ANY 
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS ON DAY ONE 
THOUGH TO THE FRUSTRATION OF M. P.'S 
B. A. A. ADMITTED IT HADN'T YET STARTED 
A POSTMORTEM 
I HAVE NOT YET MADE 
THE TIME AVAILABLE TO DO AN 
INVESTIGATION OF WHO KNEW WHAT AND 
WHEN 
MEANWHILE BACK HERE AT WHEN TERMINAL FIVE BRITISH AIRWAYS CLAIMS 
IT'S HAD AN INDISRUPTED SERVICE FOR 
THREE WEEKS NOW BUT THIS TERMINAL 
IS ONLY HALF FULL MOST LONG HAUL 
FLIGHTS ARE DUE TO BE TRANSFERRED 
IN TO HERE OVER THE COMING MONTHS 
PUTTING MORE PRESSURE ON T. FIVE THAT'S 
WHY THE M. P.'S BELIEVE LESSONS MUST BE 
LEARNED NOW 
WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME 
PICTURES FROM DORSET FOSSIL 
HUNTERS HAVE DESCENDED ON A STRETCH 
OF THE COAST AFTER WHAT COULD BE 
THE BIGGEST LANDSLIP IN ONE THOUSAND YEARS 
THOUSANDS OF TONS OF ROCK HAVE 
FALLEN FROM THE CLIFF FACE JOHN 
HOW IS IT LOOKING 
THIS STRETCH OF COASTLINE IS USED 
TO LAND SLIPS AND LANDSLIDES BUT 
PEOPLE LIVING HERE HAVE SAID THEY 
HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS THE AREA IS 
AROUND ONE HUNDRED YARDS OR SO OVER THERE 
THIS IS ABOUT AS FAR AND ARE SAFE 
AS WE CAN GET TONIGHT THIS IS 
EARLIER THE STRETCH OF COASTLINE 
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED METRES LONG ABOUT THE 
LENGTH OF FOUR PROFESSIONAL 
FOOTBALL PITCHES IT HAPPENED LAST 
NIGHT IT CRASHED DOWN ON TO THE 
BEACH AND INTO THE SEA BELOW 
APPARENTLY THE SEAGULLS WENT 
BERSERK AND THERE WAS LARGE 
RUMBLE LUCKILY IT WAS HIGH TIDE SO 
THERE WAS NOBODY ON THE BEACH YOU 
CAN IMAGINE IF ALL THAT HAD FALLEN 
ON BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY AFTERNOON 
THIS WEEK SOME GRATITUDE FOR THAT 
THIS IS KNOWN AS THE JURASSIC COAST 
LOTS OF BONES AND FOSSILS IN AWE OF 
THAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
FOSSIL HUNTERS DESCENDING TO SEE 
WHAT THEY CAN FIND EMERGENCY 
SERVICES HAVE TOLD US IT IS 
IMPRACTICAL TO SEAL OFF A STRETCH 
OF THE COAST THIS LONG THEY SAY 
THEY CANNOT DO IT BUT THEY ARE 
PREPARED TO SAY STAY AWAY IT'S 
NOT SAVED THERE COULD BE MORE OF 
THIS SLIPPING AND SLIDING IN 
SUBSEQUENT DAYS AND HOURS IT IS 
NOT SAFE THEY ARE HOPING TO SEEK 
WILL NATURALLY WASH IT ALL AWAY 
WITH ALL THAT RUBBLE IT LOOKS LIKE 
IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME 
CANNABIS IS TO BE RECLASSIFIED BY 
THE GOVERNMENT AS A MORE DANGEROUS 
DRUG AGAINST THE RECOMMENDATION OF 
ITS OWN ADVISERS 
NASA'S MISSION TO GO WHERE NO MAN 
HAS GONE BEFORE TO AN ASTEROID THAT 
IS HURTLING TOWARDS EARTH 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON A BATTLE TO 
KEEP THE JOLLY ROGER FLYING IN 
FRONT OF HIS HOUSE 
GREAT ART OR A LOAD OF PONY WHICH 
WILL BE THE RIVAL FOR THE ANGEL OF 
THE NORTH 
TO THE UNITED STATES WHERE SOME OF 
HILLARY CLINTON'S SUPPORTERS HAVE 
BEEN URGING HER TO DROP OUT OF THE 
RACE TO BECOME THE DEMOCRAT 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BARACK 
OBAMA HAS STRENGTHENED HIS LEAD 
SENATOR CLINTON WON IN INDIANA BUT 
IT WAS A NARROW VICTORY 
IT WAS ALWAYS CLEAR THE VOTERS OF 
INDIANA IN NORTH CAROLINA COULD 
CHANGE THIS RACE AND NOW THEY HAVE 
THE NUMBERS ARE ALL AGAINST HER NOW 
BUT HILLARY CLINTON STILL REFUSES 
TO QUIT 
IF HIS FULL SPEED ON TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE 
WHAT DOES SHE MOMENTS LATER WITH 
HER HUSBAND LOOKING DOWN CAST SHE 
SOUNDED ALMOST READY TO GIVE UP 
WHAT EVER HAPPENS I WILL WORK FOR 
THE NOMINEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
BECAUSE WE MUST WIN IN NOVEMBER 
HILLARY CLINTON NEEDED A WIN IN 
INDIANA INSTEAD SHE WON BY 
HAIR'S BREATH SUDDENLY HER 
BULLDOZER OF CAMPAIGN LOOKS TO BE 
STOPPED IN ITS TRACKS 
EVEN THOUGH 
THIS RACE WILL GO ON HILLARY 
CLINTON WILL CAMPAIGN IN WEST 
VIRGINIA TODAY BUT THIS NOMINATION 
FIGHT IS OVER 
FOR BARACK OBAMA IT 
SEEMS TO BE A NEW DAY HE HAS HAD A 
TOUGH COUPLE OF MONTHS LOST 
IMPORTANT STATES HIS JUDGMENT AND 
PATRIOTISM HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED 
BUT HE TOOK A VICTORY IN NORTH 
CAROLINA ON A HUGE TURNOUT ACROSS 
BLACK AND WHITE VOTERS 
I LOVE THIS 
COUNTRY TOO MUCH TO SEE IT DIVIDED 
AND DISTRACTED AT THIS CRITICAL 
MOMENT IN HISTORY L. BELIEVE IN OUR 
ABILITY TO PERFECT THIS NATION 
BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY REASON I'M 
STANDING HERE TODAY 
HE SEEMS 
REINVIGORATED NOW THE FLUENCY 
THE TOUCH OF THE CREATURE IS BACK 
HILLARY CLINTON SAYS SHE WILL FIGHT 
ON BUT THE MATHEMATICS AND THE 
MOMENTUM OF THIS RACE NOW LIVE WITH 
BARACK OBAMA CAMPAIGN AND THIS BAR 
SCANDAL THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT 
WILL STOP BARACK OBAMA NOW BECOMING 
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S CANDIDATE 
FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED 
STATES STATES THIS NEXT STORY SOUNDS LIKE SCIENCE 
FICTION BUT IT MIGHT COME TRUE 
NASA IS CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL TO 
LAND A MANNED SPACECRAFT ON AN 
ASTEROID EXPERTS SAY IT COULD HELP 
EXPLAIN WHY ASTEROIDS MOVE THROUGH 
SPACE AND WHETHER IT COULD BE 
DEFLECTED IF IT WAS HEADING TOWARDS 
THE EARTH 
IT IS THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO THAT 
HOLLYWOOD LOVES A GIANT ASTEROID 
HURTLING THROUGH THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
IN OUR DIRECTION AND THEN CRASHING 
INTO US 
THAT IS WHY THE AMERICAN SPACE 
AGENCY NASA HAS TRIED TO DISCOVER 
MORE ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL THREAT 
SEVEN YEARS AGO A SMALL ROBOTIC 
SPACECRAFT LANDED ON AN ASTEROID 
THE NEXT STEP IS MORE AMBITIOUS A 
NEW SPACECRAFT SPACECRAFT BEEN 
DESIGNED TO CARRY ASTRONAUTS IS 
SCHEDULED TO FERRY THEM TO THE MOON 
AND BEYOND AND SCIENTISTS RECKON IT 
COULD INCLUDE AN ASTEROID THE IDEA 
WOULD BE TO LAUNCH THIS MISSION TO 
A. R. ASTEROID THAT IS DUE TO PASS 
RELATIVELY CLOSE TO WITH THE EARTH 
THIS IS US ON OF IT AND IN YELLOW 
THIS IS THE ASTEROID NASA IS 
THINKING OF TRYING TO REACH AND 
LAND ON IT IS TRAVELLING AT HIGH 
SPEED SO THE SPACECRAFT WOULD 
CAREFULLY APPROACH IT AND THEN MAKE 
THE FINAL DESCENT RIGHT ONTO THE 
SURFACE IT WOULD HAVE TO LOCK ON 
BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE NO GRAVITY 
HERE IS THE ROOT OF THE SPACECRAFT 
FROM BIRTH AND AFTER LANDING THE 
ASTRONAUTS WOULD RIDE PIGGYBACK 
STUDYING THE ASTEROID AS IT HEADS 
THIS WAY IT IS ALL A VERY LONG WAY 
OFF 
IT SOUNDS LIKE SCIENCE FICTION OFF BUT FORTY YEARS AGO THE IDEA OF 
SOMEBODY WALKING ON THE MOON 
SOUNDED THE SAME NOW IT IS FORTY 
YEARS SINCE IT HAPPENED IT IS 
CHALLENGING BUT WITH ALL THE RIGHT 
INVESTMENTS THERE IS NO REAL 
REASONS HE SHOULDN'T HAPPEN THEY 
WON'T BE EASY 
WILL WE SEE ASTRA 
LLOYDS ASTRONAUT WALKING ON THE 
SIDE OF A MASQUERADE AS THEY DID ON 
THE MOON SCIENTISTS INVOLVED SAY 
IT IS FEASIBLE BUT IN THE END IT 
WILL COME DOWN TO THE MONEY 
AMY WINEHOUSE HAS BEEN ARRESTED AND 
QUESTIONED ON SUSPICION OF DRUGS 
OFFENCES SHE IS BEING INTERVIEWED

THE HOSPITAL THEY SAY THE HUSBAND

WHEN HE THINK OF A CHARITY SHOP 
YOU MIGHT THINK OF KNITTED JUMPERS 
CRUMPLED SECOND HAND SUITS NOT AT 
OXFAM OXFAM SHOPS ARE HAVING A 
MAKEOVER SOME OF THEM WILL BE 
SELLING CLOTHES THAT WOULDN'T LOOK 
OUT OF PLACE IN SOME OF THE 
SWANKIEST BOUTIQUES 
THIS AFFLUENT PART OF WEST LONDON 
MIGHT BE THE LAST PLACE YOU WOULD 
EXPECT TO FIND OXFAM HOLDING ITS

STAFF HERE AND 
LOOK OUT FOR ITEMS OF CLOTHING LIKE 
THIS STRESS DATED AND DIFFICULT TO 
SELL IN THE SHOPS BUT ONCE HAVING 
BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING THE 
POTENTIAL TO BE REWORKED THIS 
COULD BECOME A DESIRABLE DESIGNER 
ITEM SUCH AS THE ONE I AM WEARING 
VIRTUALLY EVERY PATCH OF CLOTH ON 
THE STRESS CAME FROM AN ITEM OF 
CLOTHING DONATED TO OXFAM IT MAY 
NOT BE EVERYONE'S CUP OF TEA BUT 
IT IS BEAUTIFULLY MADE AND AN 
ORIGINAL AND THERE IS DEFINITELY A 
MARKET FOR THAT OXFAM GOT A FREE 
SERVICES OF THE WOMAN WHO 
REVELATION REVOLUTIONISE TOPSHOP 
WE WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY OUT OF 
THE SHOPS SO OXFAM CAN TRY AND 
ALLEVIATE POVERTY IT IS A BOUTIQUE
