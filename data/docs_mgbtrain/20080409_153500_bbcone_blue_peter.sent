TOP LONDON GALLERY HOW EASY OR 
DIFFICULT IS IT TO CREATE YOUR OWN 
MASTERPIECE L. THOUGHT I WOULD GO AND FIND OUT 
I'VE BEEN SET ONE OF MY FAVOURITE 
CHALLENGES SO FAR 
TO CREATE A PIECE OF ART TO BE HUNG 
IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS 
I WENT TO MEET PROFESSOR MAURICE 
COCKRILL TOP ARTIST 
AND PROFESSOR OF ART AT THE ACADEMY 
SCHOOL SCHOOL HELLO MAURICE I'M ZOE 
I'M VERY PLEASED TO MEET YOU 
THANKS FOR INVITING ME HERE 
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT CREATING 
A PIECE OF ART 
THAT WILL BE HUNG IN 
THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS 
I'M SO NERVOUS L. DON'T HAVE A GCSE 
OR AN A LEVEL IN ART I'M CLUELESS 
QUALIFICATIONS ARE NOT IMPORTANT 
BUT YOU'VE GOT A TOUGH JOB 
WE HAVE THE VERY HIGHEST STANDARDS 
YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT YOUR VERY BEST 
I'VE DONE A FEW SKETCHES OF MY OWN 
BUT I NEED SOME SERIOUS TUTORING 
SHALL I SHOW YOU WHAT I'VE DONE 
OF COURSE I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM 
PROF COCKRILL IS AN ARTIST WHOSE 
WORKS SELL FOR THOUSANDS OF POUNDS 
HE DECIDES WHAT WORKS ARE DISPLAYED 
IN THIS ANCIENT INSTITUTION 
SO HE'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH ONE 
TO IMPRESS 
O. K. I'VE DRAWN SOME SUNSHINE HERE 
I'VE GOT SUNSHINE RADIATING OUT 
THIS ONE IS A TEAR OF JOY 
THAT'S A MOUTH AND SOME TEETH 
DIFFERENT STARS 
CASTLES AND STAIRWAYS 
THIS IS JUST RINGS AND CIRCLES 
THESE ARE IMAGES THAT COME INTO 
MY HEAD WHEN I THINK OF HAPPINESS 
THE THING THAT'S HANDICAPPED WHAT 
YOU'VE DONE IS THE LACK OF COLOUR 
COLOUR WILL GIVE IT MUCH MORE 
DYNAMISM AND MUCH MORE MEANING 
O. K. L. NEED A BRUSH IN ONE HAND AND 
SOME COLOURED PAINTS IN THE OTHER 
SOUNDS MESSY L. NEED TO GET 
MY OVERALLS ON 
WHAT DO WE DO NOW 
WE WON'T WORRY 
TOO MUCH ABOUT MAKING AN IMAGE 
WE'LL TRY OUT THE COLOURS AND SEE 
HOW THEY LOOK THREE BASIC COLOURS 
FOR BEGINNER LIKE ME 
THE BEST PLACE TO START 
WAS WITH THE THREE PRIMARY COLOURS 
I HAD MY BRUSHES MY FAVOURITE 
COLOURS AND AN ARTIST'S PALETTE 
ONCE I GOT STARTED 
THERE WAS NO STOPPING ME 
WITH HAPPINESS AS MY INSPIRATION 
THE ARTWORK FLOWED 
VERY FREE HANDLING 
CREATIVE FREEDOM 
THAT'S TERRIFIC THEY HAVE 
INCREDIBLE PRESENCE THOSE STARS 
MAURICE AM I A GOOD STUDENT 
I THINK YOU ARE A GOOD STUDENT 
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TOO OBEDIENT 
YOU'VE GOT A MIND OF YOUR OWN 
WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING TO HAVE 
I WANT TO SEE THIS CASTLE IN THERE 
YEAH LET'S PUT IT IN OVER THERE 
I DON'T THINK THIS COULD BE HUNG 
IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS 
BUT DO YOU THINK I'LL EVER GET 
TO THE STANDARD 
WHERE I CAN CREATE PIECE 
THAT COULD BE HUNG 
I AGREE YOU'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET 
YOU'RE AIMING VERY HIGH 
THAT'S QUITE A DIFFICULT THING 
TO ACHIEVE IN A VERY SHORT TIME 
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE 
WE'LL CALL THIS A STUDY 
IT'S AN EXCITING POWERFUL STUDY 
HAVE IT IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND 
WHEN WORKING ON THE FINAL PAINTING 
WHAT IF I DO A BIT OF THIS 
WILL MY PAINTING BE UP 
TO THE PROFESSOR'S STANDARDS 
I WONDER WHAT THAT PAINTING IS 
GOING TO LOOK LIKE DO YOU RECKON 
THE ART WORLD WOULD LIKE IT STICK 
AROUND TO FIND OUT TODAY WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT ROBOTS NOW WAS A 
GREAT TIME TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT 
THEM 
THE TERM ROBOT COMES FROM THE WORD 
MEANING FORCED LABOUR SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY ONE 
VARIOUS FORMS OF ROBOT HAVE 
APPEARED IN SCIENCE FICTION FILMS 
AND T. V. FILMS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY 
FAMOUS T. V. ROBOTS INCLUDING THE 
CYBERMEN FROM DOCTOR WHO ALTHOUGH LONG 
WAY FROM THESE FICTIONAL CHARACTERS 
REAL SCIENTISTS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP 
ROBOTS LIKE THESE WHICH CAN RUN 
DANCE CLIMB STAIRS RECOGNISE 
PEOPLE'S FACES VOICES AND EVEN 
DELIVER A YOUR DRINKS JUST LIKE A 
REAL PERSON IN EVERYDAY LIFE 
HOWEVER ROBOTS ARE USED IN VERY 
DIFFERENT WAYS FROM CONDUCTING 
EXPERIMENTS IN SPACE TO VACUUMING 
YOUR HOUSE FROM MAKING PRODUCTS 
AND FACTORIES TO ASSISTING IN 
SURGERY ROBOTS HELP THE MODERN 
WORLD GO ROUND 
I AM LOVING IT IN THE STUDIO IT'S 
LIKE BEING A KID AGAIN IT'S 
AMAZING 
WELCOME TO MY WORLD WHAT AMAZING WHAT IS THIS 
IT'S THE SHADOW HAND IT'S 
A BIT LIKE A HUMAN HAND AND ONE OF 
THESE HAS BEEN BOUGHT BY NASA THEY 
ARE USING IT FOR ROBONAUT AN 
ARTIFICIAL ASTRONAUT THEY ARE 
BUILDING TO WORK OUTSIDE A SPACE 
STATION 
THAT'S IMMENSE HOW DOES STATION THIS WORK 
YOU CAN SEE THE LINES 
THROUGH IT THOSE ARTIFICIAL 
MUSCLES YOUR MUSCLE TENSES WHEN 
YOU WANT TO LIFT YOUR ARM AND 
SLACKS WHEN YOU WANT TO LET IT GO 
IT HAS A PERROTT MUSCLES FOR EVERY 
JOINT 
WHAT IS THE HISSING SOUND JOINT THEY PUMP AIR INTO THE MUSCLE THEN 
THEY LET IT OUT AGAIN TO RELAX IT 
BRILLIANT STUFF WE WILL SPEAK TO 
YOU A LITTLE LATER ON IT'S NOT BAD 
IS IT 
I WOULDN'T MIND ONE AS A 
PET THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOU GUYS 
WHO HAVE ENTERED OUR POSTCARD TO 
BEIJING COMPETITION THE GAMES 
THEMSELVES ARE JUST SEVENTEEN WEEKS AWAY 
AS PART OF THE BUILD UP THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH WAS IN LONDON LAST 
WEEKEND L. WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO CARRIED IT 
THE OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES

ON THE PLANET

ONLY GOES OUT WHEN THE GAMES END 
THE FLAME STARTS LIFE IN GREECE 
AT OLYMPIA THE SITE 
OF THE FIRST EVER OLYMPIC GAMES 
USING A TORCH THE FLAME IS THEN 
PASSED AROUND THE WORLD 
THE TORCH IS BEING CARRIED BY OVER 
TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THROUGH TWENTY TWO CITIES 
IT WILL ARRIVE IN BEIJING IN AUGUST 
AFTER TRAVELLING OVER EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES 
LAST SUNDAY I WAS ONE OF EIGHTY PEOPLE 
WHO CARRIED THE TORCH ACROSS LONDON 
AS YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN ON THE NEWS 
SOME PEOPLE PROTESTED

TIBET AND TREATS THE TIBETAN PEOPLE 
AT TIMES PROTESTERS TRIED TO 
DISRUPT THE TORCH'S JOURNEY 
INCLUDING HERE WHEN IT WAS BEING 
CARRIED BY KONNIE 
HOWEVER MY PART OF THE JOURNEY 
PASSED OFF RELATIVELY PEACEFULLY 
BEFORE I KNEW IT IT WAS TIME 
TO PASS THE FLAME ON 
WOW WHAT A PRIVILEGE AND HONOUR 
IT'S MANIC YOU'RE SURROUNDED 
BY SO MANY PEOPLE 
OVER THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS 
THE TORCH WILL CONTINUE

AND NOW FOR THE NEXT LETTER IN OUR 
A Z. OF WEIRD ANIMALS O. IS FOR OKAPI 
THEY ARE PART OF THE SAME 
ANIMAL GROUP AS GIRAFFES THEY'RE FOUND IN CENTRAL AFRICA 
ALL IS NOT AS IT SEEMS 
I ALSO THINK IT LOOKS LIKE A ZEBRA 
TOBY IS IT RELATED TO THE ZEBRA 
NO IT HAS NO RELATION TO THE ZEBRA 
THEY'RE RELATED TO GIRAFFES 
THE STRIPES ON THEIR BUM 
HELP THEIR CALVES TO FOLLOW THEM 
THROUGH THE JUNGLE AND NOT GET LOST 
SO IT'S LIKE WEARING A FLUORESCENT 
JACKET SO THEIR YOUNG CAN SEE THEM 
WHAT ELSE SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT THEM 
INSTEAD OF GRAZING ON GRASS THEY 
BROWSE ON LEAVES TWIGS AND BARK 
RUBANI HAS BLUE TONGUE THAT'S 
ABOUT FOOT LONG AND PREHENSILE 
IT'S LIKE AN EXTRA LIMB REALLY 
HE CAN USE IT TO GRASP LEAVES AND 
FRUIT HE COULDN'T REACH OTHERWISE 
A TONGUE AS AN EXTRA LIMB 
BRILLIANT BRILLIANT WHEN THEY'RE EATING THEY MIGHT GET 
DUST IN THEIR EYES FROM THE TREES 
SO THEY CAN LICK THEIR EYES 
AND ROUND THEIR EARS AS WELL 
THEIR TONGUES AREN'T JUST FOR 
EATING 
I CAN'T GET VERY M. AT ALL EATING I CAN ONLY CLEAN ROUND HERE YOU YOU WOULDN'T MAKE A GOOD OKAPI ZOE 
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CLEAN MY FACE 
WITH MY SHORT TONGUE NO NO RUBANI LOOKS VERY HUNGRY 
WHAT'S HE MUNCHING ON 
THIS IS BAMBOO FROM THE ZOO GROUNDS 
IT'S WHAT THEY'D EAT IN THE WILD 
IT'S THE MOST NATURAL DIET FOR THEM 
I'LL HAVE SALAD FOR LUNCH 
I THINK I LOVED IT I AM PUTTING IT ON THE 
AHH SIDE OF THE WALL OF WEIRD 
IF HE WOULD LIKE ANY INFORMATION 
ABOUT ANY OF OUR WEIRD ANIMALS YOU 
SHOULD GO TO OUR WEBSITE AND 
DOWNLOAD A FACT SHEET 
A LOT OF YOU

ANIMALS ADAM CENT IN THIS LETTER 
ABOUT WHAT IT LIKES TO EAT FOR 
BREAKFAST IT LIKES ITS GREENS BUT 
BENNETT LIKES TO EAT CRICKETS AND 
WAX WORMS FOR DINNER 
IN A FEW 
MINUTES YOU ARE GOING TO BE SHOWING 
US HOW TO MAKE A ROBOT IN THE 
MEANTIME IT IS TIME TO FIND OUT 
HOW MY PAINTING FOR THE ROYAL 
ACADEMY WENT DOWN WITH THE ART 
LOVING PUBLIC 
I'VE BEEN SET ONE OF MY FAVOURITE 
CHALLENGES SO FAR 
TO CREATE A PIECE OF ART THAT WILL 
BE HUNG IN A WORLD FAMOUS GALLERY 
WHAT IS MODERN ART A GREAT PLACE 
TO FIND OUT IS THE TATE MODERN 
MODERN ART IS SAID TO BE ANY PIECE 
OF ART MADE SINCE THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
THAT DOESN'T SOUND TOO MODERN TO ME 
WHAT I'VE LEARNT SO FAR 
IS THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT EXPRESSING 
YOURSELF AND HAVING FUN 
FROM THE VERY FIRST SPLAT OF PAINT 
I WAS THINKING ABOUT MY THEME 
HAPPINESS HAPPINESS IT'S THE SPLAT TECHNIQUE 
I THOUGHT I'D SPLAT IT OUT THEN 
I DUNNO SHAPE IT INTO THE CANVAS 
I'M A BIT NERVOUS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH 
I DON'T KNOW L. FEEL AS IF I'M LEARNING AS I GO WOW 
AND IT'S ALL OVER PAINT WOW SOME OF IT HIT THE CANVAS 
I LIKE IT IT EXPLODES OVER 
THE AREA THAT I'VE PAINTED 
I THINK I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING 
LIKE PROF COCKRILL HAD TAUGHT ME 
I WANTED MY BRUSH STROKES TO 
REPRESENT MY EMOTIONS ON THE CANVAS 
THAT WAS EASIER SAID THAN DONE 
THAT'S GOT TO BE GOOD 
IT WILL CERTAINLY BE FROM THE HEART 
WHICH IS THE IMPORTANT THING 
I'M GOING TO TRY AND AIM 
FOR THE CANVAS THIS TIME 
WOW LOOK AT THAT 
WHAT ABOUT DOING A BIT OF THIS 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS ORANGE 
I NEED TO MAYBE DO SOMETHING THERE 
SHALL I LEAVE YOU TO IT FOR A BIT 
YEAH O. K. THANK YOU 
IF I HEAR YOU SHOUTING I'LL COME 
IF YOU HEAR ME SCREAM 
IT'LL BE BECAUSE I'VE PUT IN 
AN EXTRA COLOUR I SHOULDN'T HAVE 
I'VE LOST MY MENTOR 
I'M COMPLETELY BY MYSELF NOW 
IT'S UP TO ME HOW THIS PROGRESSES 
OR NOT 
HOPE IT DOESN'T DIGRESS 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT 
I'VE GOT ONE FINAL THING THAT I 
WANT TO DO WITH THE SILVER PAINT 
I'LL DO THAT NOW AND THEN 
HOPEFULLY I'LL BE HAPPY WITH IT 
I THINK THAT'S IT 
I THINK I'M HAPPY WITH IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I'M ABSOLUTELY AMAZED LOOK AT THAT 
I'M AMAZED THAT YOU DID IT SO FAST 
YOU'RE SUCH QUICK LEARNER YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE OUTSIDERS 
THAT JUST COMES FROM NOWHERE 
BUT IS IT WORTHY ENOUGH TO HANG UP 
ON THE WALL IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY 
I CAN ANSWER IN ALL HONESTY THAT 
I'M CERTAIN THIS IS WORTHY TO HANG 
O. K. LET'S REVEAL IT TO THE PUBLIC 
LET'S DO THAT AGREE LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THIS PAINTING 
HERE GOES 
AH OH MY GOODNESS WOW 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT 
YOU'RE EXHIBITING IN THE ROYAL 
ACADEMY OF ARTS 
I CAN'T QUITE GET MY HEAD AROUND IT 
YOU'VE ARRIVED 
MY PAINTING WAS HUNG 
THE CROWD WAS WAITING TO BE LET IN 
WHAT WOULD THEY THINK OF MY WORK 
PROF COCKRILL AND I HID NEARBY 
TO HEAR WHAT THE VISITORS THOUGHT 
IT'S HAPPY L. WOULDN'T MIND 
HAVING IT IN MY HOUSE 
WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY 
ABOUT A LOT OF MODERN ART 
SHE'S ON OUR SIDE 
THE WHITE LINES WERE ALL BROKEN UP 
AND THE COLOURS WERE MISERABLE 
OH GOD 
HOW RUDE 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD USE 
OF COLOUR AND IMAGINATION 
A GOOD PIECE OF ABSTRACT ART 
GOOD FOR YOU 
IT DIDN'T MEAN AN AWFUL LOT TO ME 
I DIDN'T REACT VERY WELL TO IT 
L. LIKE ABSTRACTS BUT 
I DIDN'T LIKE 
THIS ONE L. LIKED THE TITLE 
BUT IT DIDN'T KIND OF TAKE ME 
ANYWHERE OH ANYWHERE OH IT'S A LOVELY EXUBERANT FRIENDLY 
RIOT OF COLOUR 
I'M THRILLED WITH PEOPLE'S COMMENTS 
AND THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE OF MAKING 
A CANVAS WHICH IS HANGING IN THERE 
YOU'VE MADE A SINGULAR ACHIEVEMENT 
WITH THAT FIRST PAINTING 
IT'S QUITE REMARKABLE 
I'M VERY IMPRESSED 
THEN IT IS IN THE FLESH IF YOU 
THINK YOU HAVE GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO 
GRACE YOUR OWN MASTERPIECE TO BE 
HUNG IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY CHECK 
OUR WEBSITE 
NOW TIME TO MAKE A ROBOT THIS IS 
QUITE TRICKY SO YOU MIGHT NEED TO 
GO ON TO THE WEBSITE FOR THE 
DETAILS YOU MIGHT NEED TO ASK YOUR 
PARENTS BECAUSE SOME OF THE BITS 
ARE TRICKY WHAT ARE WE MAKING A A LITTLE ART ROBOT WITH A VIBRATING 
MOTOR WHICH WILL DRAW FOR YOU IT IT LOOKS VERY NICE L. WILL TRY TO RUN 
QUICKLY THROUGH HOW WE ARE GOING TO 
DO IT YOU NEED CUP TURN IT 
UPSIDE DOWN AND ATTACH FOUR FELT 
TIP PENS AROUND IT WITH SOME STICKY 
TAPE MAKE SURE IT IS ABOUT THREE 
QUARTERS FROM THE BOTTOM THEN WE 
ARE GOING TO ATTACH A ELASTIC BANDS 
THIS WILL BECOME APPARENT IN A 
SECOND THE NEXT STEP YOU NEED A 
MOTOR LIKE THIS AND A PAPERCLIP 
YOU ARE GOING TO QUARREL THE END OF 
THE PAPER CLIP WITH SOME WIRES 
COIL YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACH IT TO 
THE MOTOR STICK IT TOGETHER WITH 
SOME SUPERGLUE AND PUT IT TO DECIDE 
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T STICK IT TO THE 
MOTOR 
YOU ALSO DON'T NEED TWO MOTOR WIRES LIKE THIS CHOP OFF ABOUT A 
CENTIMETRE OFF THE END OF BOTH OF 
THEM SO YOU EXPOSE THE METAL THAT 
THEN YOU ARE GOING TO ATTACH IT TO 
A METAL BULLDOG CLIP IT HAS TO BE 
METAL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS 
ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH IT THE 
NEXT WIRE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACH 
IT TO A METAL PAPERCLIP YOU'RE 
GOING TO ATTACH THAT WITH STICKY 
TAPE ON TO THE FLAT SIDE OF THE 
BATTERY THIS IS AN DOUBLE A. BATTERY WE 
ARE GOING TO FLIP AT GOVAN WHAT WE 
HAVE ALREADY DONE IS ATTACHED A 
PAPERCLIP 
THAT IS SO YOU CAN USE PAPERCLIP IT AS A SWITCH 
ONCE YOU HAVE DONE 
THAT HOPEFULLY YOUR MOTOR SHOULD 
BE NICE AND DRY WHAT YOU NEED TO 
DO IS SIMPLY ATTACH THE TWO WIRES 
ON TO THE HOLES ON THE MOTOR WE'RE 
JUST GOING TOO QUICKLY TESTED TO 
SEE IF IT WORKS THERE WE GO THAT 
IS WORKING BEAUTIFULLY 
MAKE SURE 
IT IS REALLY TIGHT 
WE HAVE MADE 
ONE RIGHT HERE ALL WE HAVE DONE IS 
ATTACHED THE MOTOR WITH A BIT OF 
DOUBLE SIDED TAPE LIKE SO WE HAVE 
REINFORCED IT WITH STICKY TAPE AND 
WE HAVE ALSO PUT THE BATTERY ON THE 
BACK IT IS JUST UNDERNEATH THE 
ELASTIC BAND 
LET'S FIRETRAP 
FIRE IT UP 
I AM SO PROUD OF THAT 
THAT WOULD RIVAL MY MASTERPIECE 
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT PAPERCLIPS 
AND FELT TIPS THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
INDEED 
THAT IS ALL WE HAVE GOT TIME FOR 
SEE YOU NEXT TIME
