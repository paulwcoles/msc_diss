HELLO WELCOME TO GARDENERS' WORLD 
I'VE PREPARED THE GROUND BECAUSE I'M GONNA SOW SOME CARROTS HERE 
FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS I'VE BEEN SOWING CARROTS NOT IN ROWS 
BUT IN BROADCAST PLOTS IN OTHER WORDS I'M SPRINKLING THEM FREELY BUT WITHIN A SPECIFIC AREA 
I'VE MARKED OUT TWO STRING LINES 
AND I'M GOING TO SCATTER THE CARROTS BETWEEN THEM 
THIS IS A VARIETY CALLED GIANT RED FROM ITALY 
IN FACT IT'S NOT THAT GIANT AND NOT THAT RED 
BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS REALLY TASTY 
I JUST SPRINKLE IT QUITE THINLY IN THIS AREA 
SO I DON'T HAVE TO THIN IT LATER WHICH WON'T ATTRACT THE CARROT FLY 
I CAN SEE WHERE THEY'RE GROWING AND THERE'S NO THINNING NO WEEDING TO DO AT ALL 
THAT'S REALLY EASY 
NOW THIS SEASON ON GARDENERS' WORLD WE'VE GOT A FEW CHANGES 
I SHALL BE HERE AT BERRYFIELDS EVERY WEEK HELPED BY ALICE 
AND COVERING THE WHOLE RANGE OF GARDENING ACTIVITIES NOT JUST VEGETABLES 
BUT EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS DOING HERE AT BERRYFIELDS 
BUT JOE AND CAROL WHO WILL BE VERY MUCH PART OF THE TEAM AS EVER 
ARE BASED AWAY FROM BERRYFIELDS 
CAROL WILL BE DOING WHAT SHE DOES BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE 
WHICH IS PROPAGATION BASED FROM HER HOME IN DEVON 
AND ALSO HELPING A YOUNG FAMILY ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AWAY FROM WHERE SHE LIVES 
CREATE AN ORGANIC ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY GARDEN 
ANYONE WHO'S WATCHED GARDENERS' WORLD OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS 
KNOWS THAT JOE SWIFT HAS MANY TALENTS BUT GROWING VEGETABLES IS NOT REALLY ONE OF THEM 
BUT THAT'S ALL CHANGING 
HE AND HIS FAMILY ARE GETTING RID OF THEIR WEEKLY VEGETABLE BOX 
AND JOE HAS TAKEN ON THE TASK OF SUPPLYING THEM ALL WITH VEGETABLES 
HE'S STARTED AN ALLOTMENT 
AND WE SHALL BE VISITING HIS PROGRESS EVERY WEEK TO SEE HOW HE GETS ON 
FOLLOWING ALL HIS TRIUMPHS AND PERHAPS SOME OF HIS TEARS TOO 
I'VE LIVED IN HACKNEY FOR ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS 
THIS IS KATHY MY WIFE AND CONNIE AND STANLEY MY DAUGHTER AND SON 
LIKE MOST PARENTS WE TRY TO GET THE KIDS TO EAT REALLY HEALTHILY 
LOTS OF FRUIT AND VEG 
TO BE HONEST THEY REALLY LOVE THEIR FRUIT AND VEG 
SO THEY'RE NO PROBLEM AT ALL 
FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE'VE BEEN GETTING A LOCAL BOX SCHEME 
AN ORGANIC BOX DELIVERED ONCE A WEEK TO THE FRONT DOOR 
BUT I'VE BEEN TOYING WITH THE IDEA OF GETTING AN ALLOTMENT 
YOUR NANNY HAS GOT A GREAT ALLOTMENT UP IN CAMBRIDGE HASN'T SHE 
YES AND YOU LIKE TO GO AND HELP HER 
YES AND WE PLANT POTATOES 
YOU DO A LOT OF DIGGING DON'T YOU YEAH 
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OVER AN ALLOTMENT WHAT DO YOU THINK SHALL WE GO FOR IT THIS YEAR 
AND WE'LL HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE TO THE BOX 
AND WE'LL HAVE TO DO IT ALL BY OURSELVES BYE BYE 
BYE BYE 
THAT VEGGIE BOX HAS BEEN GREAT FOR WELL A FEW YEARS WE'VE BEEN GETTING IT 
BUT I'M A GARDENER I SHOULD REALLY BE GROWING THIS STUFF MYSELF 
AND ALSO GETTING THE FAMILY INVOLVED A LITTLE BIT 
KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE EATING AND THEY LOVE GARDENING TOO BUT OUR GARDEN'S NOT APPROPRIATE 
IT'S A FAMILY SPACE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM TO GROW SERIOUS AMOUNTS OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 
OR EVEN JUST LETTING THE KIDS HAVE A REALLY GOOD DIG AROUND 
SO I HAVE GOT MYSELF AN ALLOTMENT IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIND BECAUSE WHERE I LIVE IT'S PRETTY INNER CITY 
AND THERE'S A HUGE DEMAND 
EVERYONE'S GOT THE SAME IDEA AS ME EVERYONE WANTS AN ALLOTMENT 
I'VE PUT MY NAME DOWN ON THE WAITING LIST 
BUT IT COULD BE THREE YEARS BEFORE ONE ACTUALLY COMES UP 
I CAN'T BE WAITING THAT LONG SO I FANNED OUT MY SEARCH A LITTLE BIT FURTHER 
I LOOKED AROUND AND I SAW SOME QUITE NICE ONES 
BUT OVER THE COURSE OF A FEW WEEKS 
I MUST HAVE SEEN ABOUT FIVE OR SIX OF THEM BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING WRONG 
A LITTLE BIT TOO NEAR A REALLY BUSY ROAD 
OR NOT QUITE THE ATMOSPHERE THAT I WANT TO SPEND THE WHOLE WEEKEND GOING UP TO WITH THE KIDS 
AND THEN I FOUND ONE ON THIS SITE THAT I REALLY REALLY LIKE 
WE'RE GONNA GO UP THERE NOW YOU'LL SEE IT IN A MINUTE 
THIS IS MY PLOT 
NOT THE WHOLE THING 
THERE'S TWO PLOTS HERE 
BUT THIS IS MY ONE 
GOT THE WATER TANK 
THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD 
GOT THE WATER TANK 
THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD 
FULL OF NICE CLEAN WATER 
FROM HERE ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE BRAMBLES AT THE BACK IS MINE 
THERE'S KEITH 
I'VE MET HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES HE'S GONNA BE WELL HANDY 
I WANTED TO BE NEXT TO SOMEONE WHO KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING 
ALL RIGHT KEITH 
HOW'S IT GOING 
SHOULD GET SOME PHOTOS ACTUALLY 
OBVIOUSLY IT'S JUST COMPLETELY COVERED IN WEEDS AT THE MOMENT 
BUT THEY'RE GONNA COME AND SCRAPE IT OUT THEY'RE GONNA COME TODAY THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT 
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TO MEET THE DIGGER MAN 
HE'S GONNA COME AND SCRAPE ALL THIS COUCH GRASS OFF 
NORMALLY THEY JUST ROTOVATE STUFF OVER 
BUT WITH COUCH GRASS 
IT'S JUST GONNA CHOP THE ROOTS UP IT'S GONNA GET STUCK IN THERE 
AND I'M JUST GONNA SPEND THE WHOLE YEAR GETTING IT OUT HELLO KEITH 
YOU'RE DOWN HERE EVERY DAY AREN'T YOU 
I GENERALLY COME OUT FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS EVERY DAY 
DON'T ALWAYS DO ANYTHING 
YOUR PLOT'S LOOKING GOOD 
THAT'S ONE REASON I'M NEXT TO YOU COS YOU'RE THE MAN WITH ALL THE INFO 
WISH SOMEBODY'D TELL ME THAT I'M GONNA BE LEARNING A LOT FROM YOU 
ALL THESE PLOTS HAVE GOT WHAT'S CALLED MARE'S TAIL 
OH RIGHT NOW YOU TELL ME EQUISETUM YEAH 
IT THAT BEING RUDE 
SOUNDS RUDE BUT IT'S QUITE A PERNICIOUS WEED ISN'T IT YEAH PAIN IN THE NECK 
I'M WAITING FOR THIS GUY TO COME AND SCRAPE OH LIAM YES 
YEAH LIAM TO SCRAPE THE PLOT TODAY 
I'M GONNA GO AND TAKE SOME MORE PICTURES 
O. K. O. K. 
THIS PLOT IS TEN POLES 
WHICH MEANS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE METRES 
IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE METRES A POLE LONG AND ABOUT TEN METRES WIDE 
SO IT'S A BIG FULL PLOT 
AND IT'S COSTING ME 
SIXTY FIVE FOR THE YEAR 
IT'S A BIG PLOT BUT 
I THINK I CAN COPE 
I'D LIKE TO THINK I'D BE PLANTING IN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE WEEKS 
REALLY 
YOU'RE JOKING 
NO 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
NO YOU'VE GOT TO BE 
I'VE GOT TO BE HAVEN'T I 
TWO OR THREE WEEKS IS YEAH I KNOW IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT AT THE MOMENT 
THERE'S A LOT OF WEEDS IN HERE 
WHERE'S THE DIGGER MAN 
WHAT TIME IS IT SHOULDN'T THE DIGGER MAN BE HERE BY NOW 
RIGHT ON CUE MAN AND MACHINE TURN UP BRILLIANT 
HE'S GONNA SAVE ME LOADS OF WORK 
WE'RE LUCKY ON THIS SITE BECAUSE WE GET A FREE SCRAPE THROWN IN FOR OUR MONEY 
I'M NOT SURE IF OTHER PLOT HOLDERS AROUND THE COUNTRY CAN BE CHARGED 
SO MY ADVICE IS JUST CHECK IT OUT WITH YOUR ALLOTMENT OFFICER 
THIS'LL SCRAPE OFF THE SURFACE WEEDS BUT I'M A BIT WORRIED COS I DON'T WANT TO LOSE TOO MUCH TOPSOIL 
I'VE ASKED HIM TO JUST LIKE BREAK IT UP ONCE HE'S SCRAPED EVERYTHING OFF 
IT'LL BE REALLY GOOD IF HE COULD JUST BREAK IT UP A BIT 
TO LET THE MOISTURE RUN OFF AND ALSO IF WE DO HAVE A FROST 
THAT'LL REALLY HELP BREAK UP THE CLAY SOIL AS WELL AND JUST DO EXTRA WORK FOR ME 
A FOOT OF DECENT SOIL WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD 
THE ROOTS 
ARE BAD 
YOU CAN SEE HERE ALL THESE LITTLE FIBROUS ROOTS 
IF THEY STAY IN THE SOIL 
IF YOU PUT A ROTAVATOR OVER THAT 
THAT'S GONNA CHOP THAT INTO LOADS OF LITTLE BITS AND IT'S GONNA GET SCATTERED EVERYWHERE 
AND YOU'RE GONNA END UP WITH LOADS OF WEEDS COMING THROUGH 
REALLY WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS JUST GET AN EDGE 
BREAK IT UP DIG IT OVER 
AND PULL OUT THE WORST OF THE ROOTS AS YOU GO ALONG 
WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLY LABORIOUS SLOW JOB TO DO 
IT'S GONNA TAKE A COUPLE OF HOURS TO FINISH SCRAPING MY PLOT SO I'M GONNA MAKE GOOD USE OF THE TIME 
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO WHILE DRIVING TO THIS SITE 
I HAD A REAL RESULT 
ONE OF THE DIY STORES ROUND THE CORNER HAS GOT A LOAD OF FREE PALLETS GOING 
AND SOME TIMBER AND STUFF AS WELL 
THEY'RE JUST GONNA SKIP IT 
SO 
HOPEFULLY 
WE CAN BLAG IT 
WE CAN GET 'EM FOR NOTHING 
WHICH WOULD BE BRILLIANT BECAUSE I WANNA BUILT A COUPLE OF COMPOST HEAPS 
MAYBE A BIT OF A VERANDA AROUND THE DECK 
I'M A BIT AHEAD OF MYSELF AT THE MOMENT 
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE 
JUST DROVE PAST 
SAW THAT THERE WAS A LOAD OF OLD STOCK IN THE YARD IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN SITTING HERE FOR A WHILE 
THEY'RE NOT JUST GIVING THIS TO US COS WE'RE THE B. B. C. AND GARDENERS' WORLD AND EVERYTHING 
THEY WERE GONNA RECYCLE IT BUT THEY MAY AS WELL RECYCLE IT OUR WAY 
AND I CAN USE IT IN THE ALLOTMENT 
IT'S FILLING THE VAN UP 
THIS IS JUST FROM THEIR OLD STAGING STACKING SYSTEM 
THERE'S LOADS OF USES FOR THAT 
BRILLIANT 
HE'S SCRAPED ALL THE WEEDS OFF 
HE'S MADE A COUPLE OF PILES OF THEM OVER THERE 
LOOK AT THIS BRILLIANT 
HE'S BROKEN UP THE TOPSOIL 
WHICH IS FABULOUS 
WELL HE'S DONE SOME OF IT BUT HE'S COMING BACK NEXT WEEK TO GET THOSE PILES OUT THE WAY 
BUT THIS IS GONNA SAVE ME DAYS AND DAYS OF WORK 
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT 
FANTASTIC 
PRETTY PRODUCTIVE DAY ALL ROUND I THINK 
GET A COUPLE OF SHOTS BEFORE IT GETS DARK 
I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING 
HE'S FRIGHTENED OF A BIT OF HARD GRAFT 
HE WAS NEVER GONNA FORK OVER THE PLOT 
HE'S TAKEN THE EASY OPTION 
DESPITE WHAT HE SAID ABOUT CHOPPING UP THE WEEDS 
IT'S HARD WORK I CAN FEEL IT IN MY LEGS ALREADY 
THE COUNCIL LEFT IT IN HUGE CLODS OF EARTH 
IT'S GREAT THAT THEY BROKE IT UP FOR ME 
BUT IT WAS SO CLAYEY 
THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GONNA GET A FORK OR A SPADE IN IT 
I'D BE HERE FOR WEEKS 
SO I HIRED A ROTAVATOR 
JUST TO GET THINGS GOING 
I CAN SEE THAT I'M CHOPPING UP THE WEEDS AS I GO ALONG 
AND I'M GONNA PAY FOR IT LATER ON BUT AT LEAST I'VE GOT STARTED 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY THAT'S GREAT FOR ME 
THE WIND'S BLOWING IT'S NICE AND SUNNY 
AND THIS IS URBAN FARMING AT ITS BEST 
I'M LOVING IT 
THERE YOU GO 
I'VE SPEND THREE HOURS ROTOVATING 
IT'S LOOKING PRETTY GOOD ISN'T IT 
GOT IT DOWN TO QUITE A NICE FINE TILTH 
I KNOW WHERE THE AREAS OF GOOD SOIL AND POOR SOIL ARE 
THE WIND IS NOW GONNA DRY IT OUT REALLY NICELY 
I'VE JUST GOT A BIT OF A PROBLEM 
WELL RATHER A BIG PROBLEM 
I'VE JUST GOT WEEDS CUT UP EVERYWHERE NOW 
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO PICK THEM UP AS I GO ALONG 
SO IN JUST TEN DAYS MY PLOT HAD CHANGED FROM AN OVERGROWN FIELD OF WEEDS 
INTO SOMETHING THAT RESEMBLED A SMALLHOLDING 
BUT THE NEXT STAGE WAS TO START TURNING IT INTO A REAL ALLOTMENT 
AND WHO BETTER TO CALL 
THAN THE NATIONAL ALLOTMENT TRUST PLOTHOLDER OF THE YEAR 
HELLO PETER HELLO JOE 
NICE TO MEET YOU GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT 
I'M GLAD I DIDN'T COME IN SLIPPERS AS WELL 
I KNOW IT'S BEEN A BIT WET IT'S DRYING OUT THIS IS MY PLOT HERE 
IT LOOKS LIKE PRETTY HEAVY CLAY SOIL 
BUT THAT IN THE END IS NO DISADVANTAGE 
ONCE YOU GET THIS IN CONDITION THIS CLAY SOIL IS REALLY GOOD YEAH 
BUT YOU DO HAVE QUITE A LOT OF COUCH GRASS LOT OF WEED IN IT 
WHICH I'VE NOW CHOPPED UP INTO LOTS OF LITTLE BITS 
YES YES SO WHERE YOU HAD ONE YOU'VE NOW GOT TEN 
BUT EH THE COUCH YOU CAN HANDLE 
THE COUCH WILL BY CULTIVATION BY MOVING THE SOIL THAT WILL EVENTUALLY GET RID OF COUCH 
THE MARE'S TAIL IS A BIT MORE OF A PROBLEM 
IT MIGHT TAKE YOU TWO OR THREE YEARS TO GET RID OF THAT YES 
BUT JUST GOT TO BE PERSEVERING AT IT KEEP AT IT 
AND YOU'LL WIN IN THE END 
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE LAYOUT OF IT ALL YET 
WELL I'VE YOU KNOW I'M A GARDEN DESIGNER SO I SKETCHED SOMETHING OUT 
YES 
NOW 
I WANT YOU TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST 
I HAVEN'T JUST LAID IT OUT IN LINES LIKE YOU WOULD EXPECT A NORMAL ALLOTMENT 
IT'S BASED ON THE TIMBERS THAT I MANAGED TO GET FOR NOTHING 
THESE ARE LIKE FULL LENGTHS OF TIMBER IN THESE DIAMOND SHAPES 
AND THEN SOME TRIANGLES TO FILL IN WITH PATHS IN BETWEEN SO 
IT'S GONNA LOOK SMART 
IT'S GONNA LOOK SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TO EVERYBODY ELSE'S PLOTS WHICH ARE PRETTY RECTANGULAR 
I JUST SORT OF FANCIED SOMETHING A BIT MORE FUN SO ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME OUT CERTAINLY 
THAT'S WHAT I'VE COME ALL THIS WAY TO DO EXCELLENT 
SHALL WE WHERE ARE WE GOING 
WE MAY AS WELL GO STRAIGHT DOWN WITH THEM YEAH 
THE DISADVANTAGE YOU'VE GOT OF THIS 
IS THAT YOU'VE LOST THE ACCESSIBILITY OF A RAISED BED 
GEOFF HAMILTON'S RAISED BEDS WERE NOT FOUR FOOT WIDE BY ACCIDENT 
THAT ALLOWED ACCESS 
FOR ALL OF THE BED 
WITHOUT WALKING ON IT 
IF YOU I COULD PUT A PATH DOWN THERE 
SAY I HAD A PATH DOWN HERE O. K. 
I THINK SO YES A PATH THROUGH THE MIDDLE YEAH 
THAT'LL GIVE YOU ACCESS TO NEARLY ALL OF IT 
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO CROP HERE 
SHALLOTS ONION SETS 
GARLIC WHAT ABOUT POTATOES 
THERE'S EARLIES THERE'S LATES THERE'S MID EARLIES WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE 
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IS THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT TAKES THEM TO MATURE 
EARLIES WILL TAKE TEN WEEKS SECOND EARLIES WILL TAKE ABOUT TWELVE 
THE LATES WILL TAKE FOURTEEN OR SO WEEKS WHAT VARIETIES DO YOU RECOMMEND PETER 
THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS FOREMOST IS A GOOD EARLY POTATO 
AS IS LADY CHRISTL 
BUT AT THE GARDEN CENTRE YOU'D FIND LOTS TO CHOOSE FROM WITH A FULL DESCRIPTION 
OR PICK UP A CATALOGUE AND GET 'EM MAIL ORDER 
YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT CROP ROTATION YEAH 
SO THAT YOU CAN WORK OUT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA BE PUTTING IN EACH OF THESE BEDS 
IF YOU'RE GROWING LEGUME TYPE VEGETABLES PEAS BEANS THAT SORT OF THING 
FOLLOW THOSE WITH CABBAGES BECAUSE THE CABBAGES WILL LOVE 
THE NITROGEN THAT THOSE LEGUMES LEAVE IN THE SOIL 
O. K. DON'T FOLLOW CABBAGES WITH POTATOES 
BECAUSE YOU WILL PROBABLY WANT TO LIME THE CABBAGE BED 
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT POTATOES INTO THAT 
BECAUSE YOU'LL TURN THEM SCABBY LEGUMES FOLLOWED BY CABBAGES 
DON'T FOLLOW CABBAGES WITH POTATOES THAT'S IT 
CAN I GET YOUR MOBILE NUMBER 
YES YOU NEED TO I THINK 
I'M NOT JOKING PETER 
SERIOUSLY I CAN SEE MYSELF UP HERE YOU'RE THE FOUNTAIN OF ALL KNOWLEDGE 
OH NO NO YOU ARE 
I'M NOT SURE JOE REALISES WHAT HE'S LETTING HIMSELF IN FOR 
HE'S GOT A VERY DIFFICULT PIECE OF SOIL 
LOTS OF COUCH GRASS 
AND MARE'S TAIL IN IT 
THAT IS GONNA GROW THIS YEAR AND HE COULD EASILY BE DISHEARTENED 
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET A HAT ALL ALLOTMENT HOLDERS HAVE 
YES YOU NEED ONE OF THESE I NEED ONE OF THOSE 
I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT YOU ON GARDENERS' WORLD NO HAT 
IT'S LOOKING ALL RIGHT ACTUALLY 
I WAS A BIT WORRIED COS IT'S BEEN RAINING QUITE A BIT 
AND YOU CAN SEE NOW COS THE RAIN'S WASHED AWAY THE TOP SURFACE 
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE ROOTS ALL THE COUCH GRASS ROOTS 
BUT IT'S GOOD I CAN SEE THEM THAT AT LEAST IS A START 
SO THE NEXT THING I'VE GOT TO DO IS DIG 'EM ALL OUT 
BUT I'M GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON THESE RAISED BEDS 
DIG OUT ALL THE ROOTS I CAN SEE 
A SINGLE DIG DOWN TO FORK'S DEPTH 
AND THEN LATER ON THIS MORNING 
MAYBE IN THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO 
WE'VE GOT THIS DELIVERY OF THIS GREEN WASTE COMING UP ERE 
TONS AND TONS OF IT 
APPARENTLY IT DISAPPEARS PRETTY QUICKLY 
SO I'VE GOT ME BARROW I'VE ALSO GOT SOME BARK HERE 
SO I CAN JUST BARK OVER THESE PATHS SO I'M HERE NICE AND EARLY TO GET ON WITH IT 
DIG THIS OVER 
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY WEEDS THERE ARE 
IT'S A REALLY BIG PROBLEM TO MAKE THINGS WORSE I CAN'T GET THEM OUT BECAUSE THE GROUND IS SO HEAVY 
I THINK I NEED TO CHANGE MY PLAN 
I KNOW THAT I'M JUST TRYING TO SORT OF RUSH TO GET THIS DONE 
THE SOIL'S WET 
AND REALLY I NEED TO DIG IT OVER NOW 
GET THE WORST OF THE ROOTS OUT 
LET IT DRY OUT 
AND THEN COME BACK AND GET SOME OF THE SMALLER FINER ROOTS 
WHATEVER WORK I PUT IN NOW IS GOING TO SAVE ME A LOT OF WORK IN THE LONG RUN 
BUT I'VE GOT THIS COMPOST COMING 
SO I THINK I'LL JUST STOCKPILE THE COMPOST AROUND HERE 
BUILD SOME COMPOST BINS 
FILL THEM WITH COMPOST 
SO IT'S GOING TO COOK NICELY 
UM AND JUST DO IT PROPERLY 
THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD DO 
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO 
ALL THAT WEEDING AND FORKING IS BACK BREAKING WORK 
SO TO BE HONEST A DELIVERY OF FIFTEEN TONS OF COMPOST 
IS ACTUALLY A WELCOME BREAK 
A BIG DAY DOWN THE ALLOTMENT OBVIOUSLY 
THE COMPOST IS ACTUALLY MADE FROM ALL THE GREEN WASTE COLLECTED IN THE AREA 
AT THE MOMENT THEY DELIVER HERE FOR FREE 
AND THEY MIGHT DO IT IN YOUR AREA 
AND IT'S WELL WORTH CHECKING OUT 
OH THAT IS WARM 
THAT IS SO WARM 
THERE YOU GO 
YOU KNOW THERE'S A BIT OF LEAF LITTER AND A FEW TWIGS AND STUFF 
BUT ON THE WHOLE THAT'S JUST WHAT I NEED 
SHAME HE DROPPED IT HERE AND HE DIDN'T DROP IT OVER ON MY PLOT 
THERE'S A FORK AND A BARROW GET ON WITH IT 
BUT IT'S GREAT IT'S LIKE A GATHERING POINT FOR THE WHOLE ALLOTMENT 
EVERYONE GOES THERE HAS A LITTLE BIT OF A CHAT 
AND EVERYONE MEETS AND DISCUSSES COMPOST AMONGST OTHER THINGS 
FINE HAVE RAISED BEDS 
BUT SURELY YOU WOULDN'T HAVE RAISED BEDS LIKE THAT WOULD YOU WHAT TRIANGLES RATHER THAN SQUARES 
ALL RIGHT FINE YEAH DEFINITELY 
IT DOES MY BRAIN IN EVERY TIME I WALK PAST 
IT'S ONLY A TRIANGLE RATHER THAN A SQUARE OR A RECTANGLE 
THAT'S ALL IT IS I AGREE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IS A COTTAGE GARDEN OR COUNTRY GARDEN 
WHERE YOU GO OUT THE BACK AND YOU'VE GOT ALL YOUR BITS IN BOXES 
ARE YOU WORRIED IT'S NOT PRACTICAL 
FOR A START IT'S NOT PRACTICAL WHY IS IT NOT PRACTICAL 
OF COURSE IT'S PRACTICAL 
I'M BUILDING RAISED BEDS 
I'M CHUCKING A LOAD OF ORGANIC STUFF IN THERE 
AND I WANNA BE GROWING STUFF IN THERE THAT'S PRACTICAL ISN'T IT 
NOTHING WRONG WITH MAKING SOMETHING LOOK NICE AS YOU GO ALONG I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY 
BUT EVEN KEITH NEXT DOOR OH HE THINKS I'M MAD MAKES TWO OF US 
HE THINKS I'M DOING THE HAMPTON COURT FLOWER SHOW 
TOOK THE WORDS OUT MY MOUTH 
I WOULD NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS HAVE THOUGHT OF THE DESIGN THAT JOE'S COME UP WITH 
COS I'M VERY MUCH STRAIGHT LINE RIGHT ANGLE SHARP EDGES ME 
YOU KNOW THE DESIGN OF THE TRIANGLES AND THAT 
WILL PROBABLY LOOK VERY NICE WHEN IT'S DONE 
BUT I STRUGGLE IT DOESN'T COMPUTE WITH ME 
THEY ALL THINK I'M MAD KEN HE'S NEVER SEEN A DIAMOND OR A TRIANGE BEFORE IN HIS LIFE 
EVERYTHING'S GOT TO BE A RECTANGLE O. R. A S. Q. L. A RE 
SO WHEN THEY SEE THIS OH WHAT YOU GOING TO HAMPTON COURT FLOWER SHOW CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW 
NO I'M JUST HAVING A BIT OF FUN 
COR 
THIS AFTERNOON I'M GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THESE COMPOST HEAPS BUILT OUT THE OLD PALLETS 
AND ALSO WORKING OUT WHERE THE SHED'S GONNA GO 
ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR BACK DONE YEAH THREE PALLETS 
O. K. THREE IN A ROW 
STAND YOUR BACK UP YEAH 
AND THEN THE OTHER PALLETS AGAIN AT THE END 
YOU'RE ABOUT HALFWAY ON SCREW THROUGH YEAH 
AND THAT'S YOUR T. PIECES DONE YEAH 
YOU ONLY REALLY NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE ONES THAT ARE AT THE BACK AND THE TWO END ONES DON'T YOU 
YEAH TRUE BECAUSE THEY KEEP THE HEAT IN AS MUCH AS ANYTHING AND THE DOORS AND THE MIDDLE ONES 
IN THE MEANTIME I'LL FIND A CORNER AND COLLAPSE AND DIE 
THE IDEA IS THAT THIS IS GONNA KEEP IT WELL INSULATED 
KEEP THE HEAT IN AND THESE ARE REALLY JUST DIVIDING UP THE BAYS 
AND THEN I'LL MAKE UP SOME DOORS BUT THERE'S ONLY ABOUT AN HOUR OF DAYLIGHT LEFT I RECKON 
SO I'D BETTER GET BACK TO THE BARROWING 
WELL IT'S BEEN A LONG HARD DAY 
BUT I'VE GOT JUST ONE MORE JOB 
THE COUNCIL ROUND HERE DELIVER WOOD CHIPS FOR FREE 
THEY MIGHT DO THE SAME IN YOUR AREA OR YOU COULD PHONE A LOCAL TREE SURGEON 
WHO MIGHT BE ONLY TOO GLAD TO GET RID OF SOME 
I'M USING CHIPPINGS TO MAKE PATHS AROUND MY TRIANGLES 
THIS WON'T ONLY LOOK GOOD BUT IT'LL HELP KEEP SOME OF THOSE WEEDS DOWN 
I JUST NEED A SHED NOW 
TO SLEEP IN THEN I SHALL NEVER GO HOME 
THERE WE GO NICE PATH 
PATH IS IN 
PROGRESS 
LET'S GO DOWN THE PUB 
DEEP SIGH 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THAT WAS A HARD DAY'S GRAFT THAT WAS 
AND YOU'VE GOT TO GET THAT COMPOST REALLY QUICKLY 
IT DISAPPEARS IT'S AMAZING 
BUT I'M GLAD I'VE GOT A FEW BARROW LOADS STOCKPILED IT 
BEFORE THE REST OF IT DISAPPEARS 
BUT THE FUNNIEST THING IS 
THE TRIANGLES IT'S AMAZING 
PUT A FEW TRIANGLES ON AN ALLOTMENT AND IT JUST DOES EVERYBODY'S HEAD IN 
THEY'VE NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE I CAN'T BELIEVE THE REACTION 
IT'S MY ALLOTMENT I'LL DO WHAT I WANT

AND ME RASPBERRIES AND YOUR RASPBERRIES WHEN YOU BREAK IT UP 
IT FEELS LIKE IT'S GOT SOME BODY TO IT YEAH 
IT'S WHEN IT GETS SATURATED IT'S A BIT DIFFICULT TO WORK

ARE THEY BOTH GOING IN THE SAME HOLE 
YEAH WHEN I PLANT THEM EVENTUALLY HOW FAR APART SHALL I PUT 'EM 
ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES APART

SO THAT'S GOOD I'VE GOT THE RASPBERRIES HEELED IN THE GROUND 
IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR CLEVE'S THOUGHTS ON THE SOIL 
COS THE SOIL IS QUITE GOOD BUT HE WAS QUITE SHOCKED AT THE WEEDS 
BUT I'M TRYING TO PUT THAT BEHIND ME PSYCHOLOGICALLY 
I KNOW I'VE GOT TO PHYSICALLY DO THE ACTIONS BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LET IT BOTHER ME 
NEXT WEEK I REALLY WANT TO GET SOME PLANTS IN THE GROUND 
THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG THING SO NEXT WEEK PLANTING FEST 
I'M JUST LIFTING THIS CLUMP OF SNOWDROPS TO DIVIDE THEM 
AND IT'S CALLED DOING IT IN THE GREEN 
SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PLANTS ARE STILL GREEN 
BUT THEY'VE FINISHED FLOWERING AND IT'S THE PERFECT TIME TO DO IT 
YOU CAN CREATE NEW PLANTS THAT TAKE VERY WELL 
THEY'LL GROW AWAY WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE AT ALL 
AND YOU CAN MULTIPLY YOUR STOCK OF SNOWDROPS 
WHEREAS IF YOU TRY AND PLANT THEM AS DRY BULBS THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT AND THEY OFTEN DON'T GROW 
SO THIS IS A JOB THAT I LIKE TO DO EVERY YEAR 
AND GRADUALLY THE SNOWDROPS BUILD UP THAT REPETITION IS LIFE ENHANCING IT'S NOT AT ALL BORING 
BECAUSE I FEEL THAT WITH THIS RHYTHM OF JOBS 
I'M TAPPING INTO A SORT OF RHYTHM OF NATURE 
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT JOYS OF GARDENING 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN AND IT CAN SEEM A BIT DAUNTING 
ONE OF THE REALLY INTERESTING THINGS WE'RE DOING THIS YEAR 
IS THAT CAROL IS TAKING A YOUNG COUPLE JO AND RUSSELL ASH UNDER HER WING 
AND SHE'S STEERING THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS OF CREATING AN ORGANIC ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY GARDEN 
PARTICULARLY PAYING ATTENTION TO RAISING PLANTS FROM SEED AND CUTTINGS AND DIVISION 
AND HOPEFULLY CREATING SOMETHING THAT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL 
OF COURSE CAROL HERSELF IN GARDENERS' WORLD 
WILL BE BASED IN HER OWN GARDEN IN DEVON 
I THINK MY GARDEN'S MY FAVOURITE PLACE IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD 
IT'S TAKEN 
SORT OF THIRTY YEARS OF LOVE AND DEVOTION 
TO MAKE IT WHAT IT IS 
I WANT MY GARDEN TO BE THIS SORT OF SELF SUSTAINING ENTITY YOU KNOW 
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO BRING STUFF IN 
AND BUY ME GARDEN 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED GARDENING 
I HAD TO GROW PLANTS FROM SCRATCH AND THAT WAS A FANTASTIC WAY OF FINDING OUT ABOUT THEM 
ABOUT WHAT THEY DID AND I GREW SO MANY 
IT WAS SO SUCCESSFUL THAT I STARTED TO SELL THEM 
THAT'S HOW MY NURSERY STARTED REALLY 
IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF RUNNING A NURSERY 
TO FIND SOME WAY OF PRODUCING REALLY GOOD PLANTS 
WITHOUT USING PEAT 
AND IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS A PEAT FREE MEDIUM THAT'LL REALLY GROW WONDERFUL PLANTS 
BUT HERE WE GARDEN TOTALLY ORGANICALLY 
BEING A GREEN GARDENER DOESN'T AT ALL MEAN GETTING A TEXTBOOK OUT 
AND GOING BY THE RULES 
IT REALLY IS JUST A QUESTION OF GOING ALONG WITH THE WAY THAT NATURE DOES THINGS 
EMULATING NATURE 
THE GARDEN JUST TALKS TO YOU AND IT SAYS I'M HAPPY 
UNTIL THE SECOND WORLD WAR TRADITIONAL GARDENING SKILLS LIKE PROPAGATING YOUR OWN PLANTS 
COLLECTING SWAPPING AND SOWING SEEDS WERE THE BACKBONE OF GARDENING 
BUT AFTER THE WAR THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE 
GARDENING BECAME BIG BUSINESS 
SUDDENLY IT WAS EASIER TO BUY A GARDEN RATHER THAN GROW IT 
THE INTRODUCTION OF CHEMICALS PLASTIC POTS READY GROWN PLANTS 
AND THE GROWING USE OF MASS PRODUCED AND IMPORTED GARDEN PRODUCTS 
MEANT THAT WITHOUT REALISING IT WE STOPPED BEING GREEN 
AND STARTED TO LOSE SOME OF OUR WONDERFUL GARDENING SKILLS 
WELL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ARE NOW HIGH ON THE POLITICAL AGENDA 
AND WE ALL REALISE THAT THE THREAT OF GLOBAL WARMING MEANS THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE 
FOR ME THAT MEANS RETURNING TO THE JOY OF PROPER GARDENING 
IN TWO WORDS HOME GROWN 
A GREEN GARDEN IS ONE THAT'S PROPAGATED NOT BOUGHT 
AND THAT'S DONE IN THREE MAIN WAYS DIVIDING PLANTS TAKING CUTTINGS 
AND PERHAPS THE EASIEST OF ALL COLLECTING SEEDS 
JUST LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL CASCADING PLANT 
THIS IS MOLINIA AND IT'S ONE CALLED TRANSPARENT 
AND YOU CAN SEE WHY COS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH ITS GROWTH 
AND THIS PLANT ITSELF IS ACTUALLY A SEEDLING 
THE ORIGINAL PLANT WAS TUCKED INTO THAT PHYSOCARPUS OVER THERE 
AND IT SEEDED ITSELF AND THAT'S ONLY A MATTER OF YEARS AGO 
ABOUT THREE OR FOUR YEARS 
AND ALREADY IT'S MADE THIS BEAUTIFUL MATURE PLANT 
AND IF I JUST RUN MY FINGER AND THUMB RIGHT DOWN HERE 
IT'S SO EXCITING DOING THIS 
WHAT I END UP WITH 
IS THIS SORT OF PALM FULL OF THESE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL SEEDS 
AND THE THING ABOUT IT WHAT'S SO MAGICAL 
IS THAT EACH ONE OF THOSE SINGLE SEEDS 
IS EVENTUALLY GOING TO MAKE A PLANT JUST LIKE THIS 
WELL SOWING SEEDS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE 
IT'S REALLY AS EASY AS CAN BE 
AND THIS IS THIS LOVELY MOLINIA SEED 
AND ALL YOU DO IS JUST SPRINKLE THESE AS EVENLY AS YOU CAN 
OVER THE SURFACE OF THIS COMPOST 
JUST SO YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF SEED IN THERE 
BUT SO THEY WON'T BE CROWDING EACH OTHER OUT WHEN THEY GROW 
YOU CAN JUST COVER IT WITH SOME GRIT 
AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF DOING THAT 
IS THAT YOU HELP THE COMPOST RETAIN THE MOISTURE 
SO THE SEEDS WON'T DRY OUT WHEN THEY GERMINATE 
YOU'RE REALLY REPLICATING THE SORT OF CONDITIONS THAT YOU GET OUTSIDE 
THIS SEED WOULD JUST FALL ONTO THE GROUND MAYBE BE COVERED OVER BY A BIT OF GRIT OR GRAVEL 
AND THAT'S IT JUST LABEL IT WATER IT AS SIMPLE AS THAT 
COLLECTING AND SOWING SEEDS IS ONE OF THE OLDEST CHEAPEST 
AND MOST SATISFYING WAYS TO GET NEW PLANTS 
PLANTS THAT YOU CAN USE TO SWAP FOR OTHERS OR GIVE AS GIFTS WHEN YOUR OWN GARDEN'S FULL 
I'VE BEEN DOING JUST THAT IN MY OWN GARDEN FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS 
AND I'LL KEEP ON BECAUSE GROWING PLANTS IS A WONDERFUL NEVER ENDING CYCLE 
AND GARDENS ARE NEVER FINISHED 
BUT I'M ABOUT TO MEET A FAMILY NEAR TO ME IN DEVON 
WHO ARE AT THE START OF THEIR GARDENING JOURNEY 
THEY'VE JUST MOVED IN TO THEIR NEW HOME AND THEY WANT ME TO HELP THEM 
MAKE AN ORGANIC ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY GARDEN 
JO AND RUSSELL ASH AND THEIR FOURTEEN MONTH OLD SON FINN 
MOVED IN LAST JULY THEY'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF GARDENING KNOW HOW 
BUT THEY WANT TO FIND OUT FAR MORE SO THEY CAN BE AS GREEN AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN 
SO I'VE COME TO MEET THEM AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY ALREADY HAVE IN THEIR GARDEN 
FROM THERE WE CAN REALLY START TO CREATE A WONDERFUL AREA 
THAT WILL BLOSSOM AND BURGEON OVER THE YEARS JUST LIKE MY OWN 
WELCOME TO OUR GARDEN IT'S LOVELY 
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF GRASS THERE'S A LOT OF GRASS THERE IS A LOT OF GRASS 
I THINK VERY OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE GET INTO A GARDEN AND THINGS ARE ALREADY DONE TO IT 
YOU TEND TO THINK YOU'VE GOT TO GO WITH IT YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY 
AND THIS IS THE CURVE YOU'VE GOT 
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE THIS AS AN EDGE 
YOU COULD HAVE THIS AS A LITTLE POOL THAT YOU COME TO 
WITH OTHER PLANTING IN FRONT YEAH 
YOU KNOW AND THEN INSTEAD OF FEELING THAT EVERYTHING'S 
BEEN PUSHED OVER THERE IMMEDIATELY IT WILL MAKE IT FEEL BIGGER 
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO ISN'T IT YEAH 
WHAT'S YOUR SOIL LIKE IT COULD DO WITH A BIT OF MANURING 
OH WELL IT'S LOVELY 
IT'S LOVELY OLD SOIL ISN'T IT 
YOU CAN TELL IT'S BEEN WORKED FOR AGES 
VERY LIGHT AND QUITE SANDY TOO YEAH HAVE YOU TESTED IT AT ALL 
NO NO 
THAT'S ONE THING WE'RE WANTING TO DO 
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING TO SEE MM WHETHER IT'S ACID OR NEUTRAL 
OR YOU KNOW IT'S ALKALINE I GUESS IT'S FAIRLY NEUTRAL RIGHT 
I MEAN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABOUT BUYING LOADS OF STUFF NO 
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IS GROW YOUR OWN STUFF YES 
IF YOU COULD MAKE A NURSERY BED IF YOU COULD DESIGNATE ONE BIT 
JUST GET INTO THAT MENTALITY OF PRODUCING THESE PLANTS YOURSELF 
COS IT'S NOT JUST THAT'S THE FUN OF IT YEAH GETTING CUTTINGS 
AND SEEING WHAT OTHER FOLK HAVE GOT AND GROWING THEM ON ABSOLUTELY 
IT WOULD MEAN LIFTING SOME GRASS FOR A START 
YOU COULD GET SOME MUCK IN BRING SOME SOIL FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE 
USE IT AS A PLACE JUST TO START YOU KNOW DIVIDING 
GET PERENNIAL PLANTS PULL THEM APART TUCK THEM IN 
YEAH BRILLIANT AND YOU'RE OFF THEN YES IT'S A START ISN'T IT 
YEAH I THINK IT IS 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO PUT YOUR VEG 
POSSIBLY DOWN THIS SIDE WHERE THE SHED IS 
WE'RE GETTING RID OF THIS SHED 
SO WHERE'S SOUTH THE SEA'S OUT THERE THAT'S WEST 
THAT'S WEST SO SOUTH'S THAT WAY WEST EAST 
THROUGH FROM THE THROUGH THESE BUILDINGS THE LIGHT WILL COME THROUGH 
SO WHEN DOES LIGHT GET HERE 
WHEN DOES IT ARRIVE THIS COMES IN 
AFTERNOON I THINK THIS IS SUCH A FANTASTIC AREA HERE YEAH 
AND IT WOULD JUST LEND ITSELF YOU COULD HAVE A REAL SORT OF YOU KNOW POTTAGER 
A PROPER KIND OF COTTAGEY VEGGIE GARDEN COULDN'T YOU YEAH 
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT'S GORGEOUS 
AND HAVE YOU SEEN THESE WONDERFUL 
YEAH THE LITTLE YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY 
COS THIS IS THAT'S HEDERA SO IT'S PART IVY 
OR IT'S VERY CLOSELY RELATED TO IT 
AND THAT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT YOU WOULD GET ON YOUR IVY 
AND THEY'LL TURN BLACK AND YOU'LL SEE BLACKBIRDS AND ALL MANNER OF THINGS FEEDING ON IT 
AND YOU'VE GOT FRUIT OVER HERE LOOK 
I THINK THAT'S AN APPLE SO YOU KNOW THAT FRUIT ARE GOING DO ALL RIGHT 
SO YOU COULD THINK ABOUT INTRODUCING SOME OF THEM 
GOT QUITE A LOT OF ROOF THERE DO YOU CONSERVE ANY OF YOUR WATER 
WE DID AT OUR LAST HOUSE BUT WE'VE NOT BEEN HERE LONG NOT GOT ROUND TO GETTING WATER BUTTS 
SO YOU NEED TO WE'D LIKE TO GET SOME WATER BUTTS 
BUT WE'VE ALSO GOT A WELL AS WELL 
A WELL AS WELL A WELL AS WELL 
IT'S A PUMP THE PLUNGER NEEDS MENDING 
YEAH THE LEATHER'S GONE ON THE BUT IF YOU GIVE IT A REAL GOOD GO A TIDGEY BIT OF WATER COMES OUT 
WHAT ARE YOUR PRIORITIES YOU WANT TO GARDEN IN A GREEN WAY 
I GOT INTRODUCED TO THE OUTDOORS BY MY DAD REALLY 
AND COMING FROM THE AREA OF THE COUNTRY THAT WE CAME FROM WE USED TO GO AND ACCESS THE MOUNTAINS 
QUITE A BIT SO I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A PART OF ME THAT HANKERS BACK TO SORT OF BEING OUTDOORS 
AND BEING YOU KNOW AROUND WHERE THERE'S PLANTS AND ANIMALS AND THINGS 
IF YOU'VE GOT THE LUXURY OF HAVING A BIT OF SPACE LIKE THIS AS WE DO 
IT'S GREAT TO TRY AND DRAW SOME OF THAT IN AGAIN IT'S NOSTALGIC REALLY 
FOR ME FINN AND A BIT OF A PLAY AREA OR AN AREA FOR HIM 
AND HIS LITTLE PALS THAT'S PRIMARY REALLY FOR ME 
OTHER THAN THAT VEGETABLES OR GROWING BEING ABLE TO EAT WHAT YOU GROW I THINK IS WONDERFUL 
I THINK GROWING ORGANICALLY AND GARDENING IN A GREEN WAY IT'S NOT ABOUT CHOOSING ONE LITTLE AREA 
AND HAVING A GO HERE IT'S A STATE OF MIND ISN'T IT 
YEAH A HOLISTIC APPROACH YEAH 
INSTEAD OF SPENDING A SMALL FORTUNE ON BUYING PLANTS 
JO AND RUSSELL ARE GOING TO ADOPT MY HOME GROWN APPROACH TO GARDENING 
AND A THRILLING PART OF THAT IS RECEIVING FREE GIFTS FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY 
I THINK ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS 
ABOUT GARDENING IS SWAPPING PLANTS 
AND THERE'S ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS OF EXCHANGING THINGS TOO 
I'M WORKING ON THESE CRAMBE CRAMBE MARITINA ROOTS 
AND THEY WERE SENT TO ME QUITE A WHILE AGO NOW 
AND THEY WERE SENT VIA A FRIEND FROM A FRIEND 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY RIGHT OVER IN ESSEX 
AND JUST A LITTLE BUNDLE 
LIKE THIS I CAN MAKE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PLANTS 
I ALREADY DID SOME THIS IS THE PLAIN GREEN SHOOT CRAMBE 
AND THE ONE I LOVE BEST IS THE PURPLE ONE 
AND I DID THESE BIT SAD REALLY ON NEW YEAR'S DAY 
I MEAN COULDN'T WAIT TO GET STARTED 
AND ALREADY FROM THAT BIT OF ROOT 
I'VE GOT THIS FANTASTIC LITTLE PLANT 
NOW I COULDN'T STOP THERE WERE LOADS OF THEM 
AND I'VE MADE TRAYS AND TRAYS 
BUT OF COURSE I WON'T USE THEM ALL IN MY OWN GARDEN 
BUT I'LL HAVE ALL THESE PLANTS THAT I CAN SWAP FOR OTHER THINGS 
AND I JUST THINK IT'S MAGICAL ISN'T IT 
FROM THAT LITTLE BUNDLE YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE FABULOUS PLANTS 
AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY THEM TOO 
SO WITH HELP FROM FRIENDS RELATIVES 
AND OUR FELLOW LOCAL GARDENERS GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN 
BEING GREEN IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT HOWEVER 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF MID WALES 
A SMALL COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE GOT TOGETHER 
ALL JOINED BY A SINGLE DESIRE TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE 
THEIR HOME HAD BEGUN LIFE AS A DISUSED QUARRY NEAR THE WELSH VILLAGE OF MACHYNLLETH 
BUT AS THEY WORKED TO FIND NEW WAYS OF SOLVING THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AFFECTING THE PLANET 
THE COMMUNITY SOON HAD A NEW NAME THE CENTRE FOR ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGY 
INITIALLY THERE WASN'T MUCH SUPPORT FOR THESE ECO PIONEERS 
BUT SLOWLY THEIR FINANCIAL AID GREW AS DID THE NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS 
TODAY CAT IS EUROPE'S LEADING ECO CENTRE 
SO I SUPPOSE EVERYBODY WHO CAME HERE REALLY WAS A PIONEER 
DID YOU FEEL LIKE THAT 
YEAH WE DID IN THOSE DAYS WE REALLY DID IT HAD THAT AIR ABOUT IT 
WE WERE GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD 
AND DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE CHANGED THE WORLD 
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO COME TO VISIT NOW AND WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THESE IDEAS AREN'T THERE 
IT'S TRUE AND THERE'S WINDMILLS ERUPTING ALL OVER THE PLACE 
AND SOLAR PANELS THEY'RE SEEING THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT 
NOT USING CHEMICALS FOR THE GARDENING 
ORGANIC GARDENING AT ONE TIME WAS THOUGHT OF AS BEING WELL 
SOMETHING DAFT THAT PEOPLE WITH SANDALS ON DID 
WELL LOCALS REGARDED THIS AS THE AND WIND PLACE 
COS WE USED HUMAN MANURE IN THOSE DAYS 
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE IT NOW NO 
BUT IT'S HOW THEY GARDEN AT CAT NOW THAT I WANT JO AND RUSSELL TO SEE 
I'VE BROUGHT THEM HERE TO EXPERIENCE SUSTAINABLE GARDENING PRACTICES IN THEIR PUREST FORM 
IN THE HOPE THEY CAN TAKE A TASTE OF THOSE TECHNIQUES HOME WITH THEM TO DEVON 
YOU JUST DON'T EXPECT A PLACE LIKE THIS DO YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF A QUARRY 
I KNOW IT'S WONDERFUL ISN'T IT CRACKING 
WE'VE BROUGHT OUR SOIL ALONG WITH US PERHAPS WE CAN GET THAT TESTED SEE WHERE THAT'S AT 
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK IT'S FULL OF INTRIGUING IDEAS ISN'T IT 
YEAH LITTLE POCKETS OF THINGS HERE AND THERE CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE AN INVESTIGATE EXPLORE A BIT MORE 
IF YOU WANT TO JUST TAKE OUT TWO LEVEL SPOONS OF THAT M. M. M. O. K. 
THAT'S IT BRILLIANT 
AND THEN WE JUST TOP IT UP WITH THIS WATER HERE 
WHICH IS DE IONIZED WATER 
THIS IS JUST A LITTLE TABLET THAT YOU 
CRUSH AND YOU PUT IN THERE AND YOU CRUSH IT M. M. M. 
WHAT'LL HAPPEN IS WE WAIT A MINUTE 
THE COLOUR OF THE WATER WILL CHANGE 
SO THE SOIL WE'VE GOT IN OUR GARDEN IF EM 
IF WE'RE LIVING FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE SEA DO YOU THINK POTENTIALLY IT MIGHT HAVE SAND IN IT 
DEPENDS WHERE YOU ARE THE ROCKS ON THE COAST IS A TYPE OF SEDIMENTARY MUD AND SANDSTONE MIX 
YEAH SO YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE A SANDY SOIL RIGHT O. K. 
WHICH MEANS IT'S QUITE FREE DRAINING RIGHT 
BUT IN THE SUMMERTIME YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM DROUGHT PROBLEMS 
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS 
HOLD IT UP TO THE LIGHT 
TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHICH OF THE COLOURS IS MOST LIKE THAT 
IT'S GOT A BLUEY TINGE YEAH YEAH CERTAINLY NOT YELLOW NO 
AND IT'S NOT THAT BLUE IT'S NOT BLUE 
SO SOMETHING AROUND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN WHICH IS FAIRLY NEUTRAL NEUTRAL YEAH 
SO YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT ACID LOVING 
IT'S SIXTY FIVE SO IT'S SLIGHTLY ACIDIC YOU'VE GOT A GOOD RANGE YOU CAN PLANT IN 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY GOOD 
RECYCLING WILL BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF GARDENING FOR JO AND RUSSELL 
WHILE THEY'RE HERE THEY WANT TO LEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT IT 
TOP OF THEIR LIST IS COMPOSTING 
COMPOSTING DOESN'T REALLY BEGIN IN THE GARDEN SO MUCH AS IN THE KITCHEN WITH SCRAPS 
AND FROM THE CAT'S POINT OF VIEW 
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO START COMPOSTING KITCHEN SCRAPS 
AND THEIR CARDBOARD SO IT DOESN'T GO OFF TO LANDFILL SITES 
AND INSTEAD GETS USED AS COMPOST 
AND GETS PUT IN YOUR OWN GARDEN TO FEED YOUR PLANTS TO GET NUTRIENTS BACK IN YOUR SOIL SURE 
IS THERE A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH CARDBOARD YOU CAN PUT IN THERE'S A GOOD RATIO TO HAVE 
WHICH IS TWO PARTS OF GREEN STUFF TO EVERY ONE PART OF WHAT WE CALL BROWNS 
WHICH IS THE CARDBOARD RIGHT AND MORE WOODY WASTE FROM THE GARDEN 
LEAFMOULD IS GREAT AS ADDING BULK TO THE SOIL AND ALSO 
CAN BE USED AS A MULCH TO SUPPRESS WEEDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
BASICALLY JUST PUT ALL THE LEAVES INTO ONE BIN 
AND LEAVE IT TO THEMSELVES TO GET ON WITH THE PROCESS OF DECOMPOSITION O. K. 
THE WORMERY IS GREAT FOR A SMALL GARDEN 
YOU COULD EVEN HAVE IT ON A BALCONY IF YOU WANTED TO 
OR A SMALL BACKYARD AND THAT'S IT 
IT'S TINY ISN'T IT IT IS QUITE SMALL ISN'T IT YEAH 
THIS IS A COMMERCIAL WORMERY IT'S VERY EASY TO GET A HOLD OF YEAH 
AND IT COMES AS A KIT 
THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS TO YOUR AVERAGE WORMERY O. K. 
IT ALLOWS YOU TO FILL UP ONE LAYER WHEN THAT'S FULL YOU PUT ANOTHER EMPTY CONTAINER ON RIGHT 
THE WORMS ONCE THEY'VE FINISHED COMPOSTING ONE LEVEL OF WASTE THEY GO UP INTO THE NEXT O. K. 
AND THEY ALL HAVE HOLES IN THEM AND YOU CAN SEE UNDERNEATH THIS IS THE MORE COMPOSTED WASTE 
SO THE WORMS ARE REALLY DOING THEIR JOB IN THIS ONE YEAH 
THE KIND OF WORMS THAT WORK IN THIS BIN ARE NOT EARTHWORMS ARE THEY NOT 
BECAUSE EARTHWORMS LIKE TO BURROW INTO DEEPER SOILS 
WHEN IT GETS TOO WARM OR TOO OLD 
THESE ARE CALLED TIGERWORMS BUT AGAIN YOU CAN GET THESE QUITE EASILY FROM A SUPPLIER 
THERE'S A LIQUID GIVEN OFF AS WELL ISN'T THERE THERE IS THAT'S RIGHT 
ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY REALISE IS THAT THE WAY THE PLANTS TAKE UP THE NUTRIENTS 
FROM COMPOST OR SOIL IS THROUGH LIQUID THEY DON'T EAT COMPOST 
THEY TAKE IT UP THROUGH THE ROOTS IN LIQUID SURE 
WHAT YOU GET FROM OUT OF HERE IS A LIQUID YOU CAN USE AS AN ORGANIC FERTILIZER 
BEFORE LEAVING GRACE TAKES RUSSELL COPPICING FOR HAZEL 
HE AND JO WANT TO USE NATIVE PLANTS WHERE THEY CAN 
AND HAZEL WILL SERVE THEM WELL AS PLANT SUPPORTS OR A HEDGE 
HAZEL'S GOOD BECAUSE IT'S AN INDIGENOUS PLANT 
IT'S THE COPPICERS' FAVOURITE TREE BECAUSE IT'S GOT SUCH VARIED USES 
YOU CAN GET BEANPOLES PEA STICKS FROM THESE BRANCHES 
IF YOU WERE MAKING HEDGES YOU COULD GET HEDGE STAKES AS WELL 
YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT YOU BANG IN AND WEAVE YOUR HEDGE ROUND O. K. 
IN DEVON IT'LL GROW WELL IN WALES IT GROWS WITH A SLIGHT TWIST 
WHICH MAKES MAKING HURDLE FENCES MUCH MORE DIFFICULT 
AND YOU WANNA CUT IT AT THIS ANGLE SO THAT WHEN IT RAIN IT DRAINS OFF 
AND DOESN'T DRAIN INTO THE STUMP YOU CUT IT THAT WAY THE WATER'LL ROT IT 
DO YOU WANNA HAVE A GO YEAH SURE 
IF YOU COME IN AT THAT ANGLE YEAH 
IT CUTS ON THE PULL STROKE 
THAT'S IT 
WAP OFF ALL THE BRANCHES HANGING OUT THE SIDE 
WITH THE HOOK YEAH 
ALWAYS USE THE HOOK AWAY FROM YOUR BODY LIKE THAT THAT'S IT 
CAN YOU SEE THAT BEING SOMETHING YOU'D WANT TO PUT IN YOUR OWN GARDEN YEAH 
THERE'S PROBABLY A SPACE OR WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT IN A BIT OF HEDGING GREAT THAT'S BE GOOD 
THE GOOD THING ABOUT HEDGING IS THAT YOU CAN LAY IT 
SO MOST OF IT CAN BE LOW AND HAVE THE ODD ONE YOU GROW ON TO MAKE BEANSTICKS OUT OF HMM M. M. 
IS IT FAIRLY MANAGEABLE IS IT YEAH 
IT DOESN'T GO WILD OR ANYTHING VERY EASILY 
NO HAZEL'S REALLY GOOD 
YOU CAN PLANT THEM VERY CLOSE TOGETHER BE CAREFUL OF THINGS LIKE BLACKTHORN 
COS THEY'VE GOT THORNS THAT CAN CAUSE BLOOD POISONING 
IT'S THE ONLY ONE PEOPLE RECOMMEND YOU DON'T PUT IN YOUR GARDEN O. K. 
OTHERWISE ALL THE NATIVE TREES WILL COPPICE O. K. 
BUT HAZEL'D BE GOOD YEAH THE BEST ONE 
BRILLIANT 
RUSSELL AND JO HAVE GOT THE FIRST DONATION TO THEIR GARDEN 
AND I CAN'T WAIT TO HELP THEM START THEIR VERY OWN NATIVE HEDGE WITH THAT HAZEL 
COPPICING'S A MARVELLOUS TECHNIQUE 
YOU GET TO USE THE CUT MATERIAL FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS ROUND THE GARDEN 
AND THE HAZEL'S ENCOURAGED TO GROW STRONGER AND MAKE LOADS MORE NEW SHOOTS 
AND DIVIDING A MATURE PLANT TO MAKE NEW ONES IS EQUALLY EXCITING 
BACK IN MY GARDEN NOVEMBER IS THE BUSIEST TIME FOR LIFTING AND DIVIDING 
THIS IS A HEMEROCALLIS A DAYLILY 
THE EARTH MOVED IT ACTUALLY WORKED 
SOME OF THESE THINGS WHEN THEY'VE BEEN IN FOR SOME TIME 
BECOME REALLY WELL ESTABLISHED 
AND SOMETHING THAT'S GONE IN AS A LITTLE TINY PLANT 
IN A SMALL POT TURNS INTO THIS ENORMOUS GREAT BIG CLUMP 
AND YOU CAN SEE ALL THE WAY THROUGH HERE ALL THESE NEW LITTLE POINTS OF GROWTH 
EACH ONE OF THOSE COULD MAKE A SEPARATE PLANT 
SO I'M GONNA USE THE USUAL TRIED AND TESTED METHOD OF 
DIVIDING THESE BIG SOLID CLUMPS OF PLANTS 
AND THAT IS TO PUT TWO FORKS IN BACK TO BACK 
YOU WANT TO 
MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT TWO FORKS OF A SIMILAR SIZE OR IT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY 
BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS BORROW ONE FROM A NEIGHBOUR 
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT TWO THE SAME 
YOU PUT THEM BACK TO BACK 
THEN USE THAT AS A FULCRUM TO PULL THEM APART 
AND WITH A BIT OF LUCK YEAH 
LOOK AT THAT 
THERE'S LUMP NUMBER ONE A REALLY NICE CHUNK THAT IS 
THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE ON THE END HERE 
AND THEN THIS OTHER ONE 
I COULD PROBABLY GO IN THERE AND DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING AGAIN 
SO WE'RE GOING TO GET THREE VERY HANDSOME PIECES OUT OF THIS 
I COULD MAKE THEM EVEN SMALLER 
BUT THESE WILL VERY QUICKLY BUILD UP 
AND GIVE US A LOT OF GOOD FLOWER NEXT YEAR 
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT 
THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT PROPAGATION IS YOU DON'T JUST WANT TO DO IT FOR IT'S OWN SAKE 
YOU WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE IT REALLY IS GOING TO IMPROVE 
IMPROVE THE DISPLAY IN YOUR GARDEN 
AND YOU CAN BE GENEROUS WITH THINGS 
INSTEAD OF JUST HAVING ONE LITTLE PLANT WHICH IS ALL YOU CAN AFFORD SOMETIMES FRANKLY 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE GOT VERY CATHOLIC TASTES AND YOU LIKE TO PUT LOADS OF STUFF IN 
YOU CAN HAVE MASSES AND MASSES AND YOU CAN REALLY GET THE EFFECTS YOU WANT 
IT'S ALL VERY WELL TALKING ABOUT PRAIRIE PLANTING AND DOING THESE GREAT BIG PLANTING DISPLAYS 
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE PLANT MATERIAL YOU CAN'T DO IT 
BUT THIS WAY YOU CAN DO AS MUCH OF IT AS YOU WANT 
FOR YEARS I'VE COLLECTED SOWN DIVIDED AND TAKEN CUTTINGS FROM ALL OVER MY GARDEN 
IT'S A PROCESS THAT ABSORBS ME EVERY YEAR 
I'M THRILLED THAT THIS YEAR I CAN SHARE IT ALL WITH JO AND RUSSELL 
AS THEY STRIVE TO CREATE THEIR VERY OWN GREEN AND BEAUTIFUL GARDEN 
I HOPE THAT MY PASSION FOR PROPAGATING PLANTS 
WILL ALSO INSPIRE ALL OF YOU TO GET OUT INTO YOUR GARDENS 
AND ENJOY THE WHOLE CYCLE OF GROWING AND PLANTING FOR YOURSELVES 
WELL WE'VE CAME TO THE END OF TODAY'S PROGRAMME 
BUT NEXT WEEK JOE IS TAKING HIS FAMILY 
TO GET THEIR FIRST LOOK AT THE ALLOTMENT 
AND CAROL IS DIGGING A NURSERY BED AT JO AND RUSSELL'S 
TO GET THAT CYCLE OF GARDENING GOING 
AND I'LL BE HERE AT BERRYFIELDS WITH ALICE CONTINUING OUR CYCLE OF GARDENING HERE AT BERRYFIELDS 
SO SEE YOU NEXT WEEK AT EIGHT O'CLOCK 
BYE BYE
