GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO MONDAY'S 
WORKING LUNCH WILL IT STAY OR WILL 
IT GO AS M. P.'S DISCUSS THE ABOLITION 
OF THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE ROB 
MEETS ONE COUPLE AT THE SHARP END 
I HAVE COME TO CUMBRIA TO MEET TWO 
WORKING LUNCH VIEWERS WHO BEEN 
EFFECTED BY THE CHANGES GLYNNE AND 
SUE THEY HAVE DRAN UP A GRAPH TO 
EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON GOLDEN 
TIMES FOR THE MINING GROUP PETER 
HAMBRO COMING UP HOW MANY ARE 
ESCAPING THE MORTGAGE MISERY FIXED 
RATES ARE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT 
PLENTY OF BORROWERS ARE GETTING AN 
IMMEDIATE BOSS FROM CUTS IN 
VARIABLE INTEREST RATES AND WHY 
TIME MIGHT BE RUNNING OUT FOR THE 
HUMBLE HONEY BEE FIRST M. P.'S WILL 
DEBATE THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO 
ABOLISH THE TEN PER CENT TAX BAND THIS 
AFTERNOON WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN 
THE LAST BUDGET THE MEASURE WAS 
MET WITH A LOT OF CHEERS BUT IT 
SOON AMERGED FOR MANY PEOPLE THE 
CHANGE MEANT THEY WERE MOVED INTO A 
HIGHER TAX BAND AND ENDED UP PAYING 
DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF TAX IT'S AN 
ISSUE THAT HAS EXERCISED MANY OF 
YOU WE SPENT ROB TO FIND OUT HOW 
ONE FAMILY IS BEING AFFECTED BY THE 
TAX CHANGES TAXATION POLICY 
AFFECTS EVERYONE CORNER OF THE 
UNITED KINGDOM I HAVE COME ALONG 
TO THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE LAKE 
DISTRICT WITH MIST COVERED 
MOUNTAINS IN THE BACKGROUND BEHIND 
ME TO VISIT TWO WORKING LUNCH 
VIEWERS WHO HAVEN BEEN INCENSED BY 
THE LATEST CHANGES GLYNNE AND SUE 
CAWTHORNE ARE RETIRED TEACHERS 
BOTH HAVE AN INCOME OF LESS THAN 
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND TO ADD TO THEIR PROBLEMS 
THEIR SON A WEB DESIGNER ALSO EARNS 
BELOW THAT AMOUNT TWO HOW DOES IT 
EFFECT YOU 
AS A FAMILY OF THREE 
WE ARE ALL EFFECTED BY THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PER CENT TAX BAND WE 
WILL PAY AS A FAMILY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY 
MORE IN TAX THAN WE WOULD HAVE DONE 
MYSELF AND MY SON TOGETHER WILL PAY 
ABOUT FIFTY OF THAT AND SUE ON HER 
OWN WILL PAY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TEN THAT IS ON 
AN INCOME OF ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WHAT WHAT KIND OF EFFECT DOES THAT HAVE ON 
YOU YOU WELL 
IT EFFECTIVELY WIPES OUT THE WELL WINTER FUEL ALLOWANCE WHICH IS THE 
ONLY SORT OF ALLOWANCE WE CAN CLAIM 
IT BECOMES MEANINGLESS 
I KNOW YOU 
HAVE DONE THIS REALLY COMPLICATED 
LOOKING GRAPH TALK ME THROUGH THIS 
YOU HAVE WORK OUT HOW IT EFFECTS 
PEOPLE 
I DON'T KNOW IF THE CAMERA PEOPLE PICK IT UP L. HAVE DRAWN THIS GRAPH FOR MYSELF 
IT SHOWS THE EFFECT ON DIFFERENT 
PEOPLE THAT THE ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN PER CENT BAND WILL MAKE YOU CAN SEE 
FROM MY GRAPH THE MORE YOU ARE PAID 
THE MORE YOU EARN THE LESS TAX YOU 
WILL PAY IN FACT YOU WILL GET A 
BOOST 
SUE LOOK AT IT AS A FAMILY BOOST YOU ARE ALL HIT THERE IS BOTH OF 
YOU AND YOUR SON IT MUST CAST A 
BIT OF A GLOOM OVER THE FAMILY 
DOES IT 
IN A WAY BUT IT'S MADE ME FEEL 
QUITE ANGRY BECAUSE I HAVE JUST 
BECOME A PENSIONER AND NOW I SHALL 
HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER FIVE YEARS TO 
GET THE PENSIONER'S ALLOWANCE WHICH 
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE REALLY AS SOON 
AS YOU BECOME A PENSIONER SURELY 
YOU SHOULD BE GETTING THE 
PENSIONER'S ALLOWANCE ALSO THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PER CENT BAND MEANS MY 
TAX BILL EFFECTIVELY GOES UP FROM 
JUST OVER THREE HUNDRED TO WELL OVER FIVE HUNDRED 
THAT IS THAT SEEMS A HUGE INCREASE 
TO MY MIND SPECIALLY WHEN MY 
INCOME SO LOW 
GLYNNE IS HOPING 
THAT BY WRITING TO HIS LOCAL M. P. M. 
PROTEST THE PROBLEMS FACED BY ONE 
FAMILY IN A CORNER OF CUMBRIA WILL 
ADD TO A NATIONAL DEBATE AND MOVE 
TO CHANGE A POLICY WHICH HAS LEFT 
THIS FAMILY FURIOUS AND WORSE OFF 
MIKE BREWER JOINS ME NOW MR. AND 
MRS. CAWTHORNE GAVE US THEIR 
WONDERFUL AND DETAILED ANALYSIS OF 
WHAT THINK EXPECT IT TO BE THAT 
REFLECTS THE CONCERNS OF MANY A 
LARGE NUMBER OF POOR PEOPLE ARE 
SUBSTANTIALLY LESS WELL OFF IS 
THAT YOUR VIEW 
WE THINK THERE ARE ABOUT FIVE 
MILLION FAMILIES WORSE OFF 
UNUSUALLY FOR A LABOUR BUDGET THESE 
FAMILIES WILL HAVE LOW INCOME JUST 
LIKE THE THREE PEOPLE YOU TALKED TO 
INCOMES OF BETWEEN FIVE THOUSAND AND 
EIGHT THOUSAND A YEAR YOU ARE PROBABLY 
PAYING MORE TAX THAN YOU WERE A 
YEAR AGO IF FIVE MILLION WERE 
WORSE OFF IS IT BALANCED BY THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE BETTER OFF IT'S IT'S MUCH MORE THAN BALANCED AS EVER 
WHEN YOU MAKE CHANGES YOU HAVE 
WINNERS AND LOSERS THE LOSERS ARE 
MORE VOCAL THAN THE WINNERS A YEAR 
AGO WHEN GORDON BROWN ANNOUNCED THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PER CENT BAND AND AN 
INCREASE IN TAX CREDITS HE SPENT 
MORE MONEY HE SPENT ABOUT TWO OR 
THREE BILLION MORE THAN HE HAD TO 
THE GOVERNMENT IS GIVING OUT MORE 
MONEY THERE ARE TWICE AS MANY 
FAMILIES GAINING A ARE LOSING BUT 
AS EVER IT'S THE LOSERS WHO ARE 
MORE VOCAL THAN THE WINNERS WHAT 
IS UNUSUAL IS THE LOSER ALL TEND TO 
BE LOW INCOME LOSERS WHILE THE GAIN 
REMEMBERS ON HIGH INCOMES 
THAT IS 
AN ODD SITUATION FOR A LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT TO FIND ITSELF IN 
LOOKING OVER THAT WHAT HAS THE 
EFFECTS OF LABOUR POLICY BEEN ON 
THE REDISTRIBUTION OF INCOME 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN HIGHLY 
CHANGEABLE IT'S BEEN SELECTIVE IN 
ITS REDISTRIBUTION YOU CAPTURE 
THAT WELL BY THE CHOICE OF THE 
FAMILY YOU INTERVIEWED N. ESSENCE IF 
YOU HAVE CHILDREN UNDER SIXTEEN OR IF 
YOU ARE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE YOU 
WILL HAVE PROBABLY DONE WELL OUT OF 
THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT WITH HIGHER 
TAX CREDIT HIGHER PENSION CREDITS 
AND SO ON IF YOU DON'T HAVE 
DEPENDENT CHILDREN ANYMORE IF YOUR 
CHILDREN ARE GROWN UP AND YOU ARE 
NOT YET RETIRED YOU ARE UNLIKE TO 
HAVE DONE THAT WELL OUT OF THE 
GOVERNMENT THE CHANGES LAST YEAR 
FOLLOW THAT PATTERN EXACTLY GORDON 
BROWN TRIED VERY HARD AND SUCCEEDED 
IN COMPENSATING MOST FAMILIES ABOUT 
CHILDREN FOR THE CUT OF THE TEN P. 
BAND HE DID THAT THROUGH THE CHILD 
TAX CREDITS HE COULDN'T OR DIDN'T 
DO ANYTHING SIMILAR FOR THOSE 
WITHOUT CHILDREN 
NONE THE LESS 
THE CHANCELLOR DOES FEEL LIKE HE IS 
BEING PUSHED INTO A KOERN NOW HE 
SAYS I CAN'T UNRAVEL THE SITUATION 
BUT I WILL DO SOMETHING FOR YOU 
LATER ON WHAT MIGHT HE DO 
WELL OBVIOUSLY HE IS LIMITED ABOUT 
WHAT HE CAN DO BY THE STATE OF THE 
PUBLIC FINANCES THERE REALLY ISN'T 
MUCH ROOM IN THE GOVERNMENT'S 
BUDGET 
WHEN HE MAKES THE PROMISES BUDGET THAT IS A POLITICAL OUT FOR HIM 
TECHNICALLY HE HAS NO POWER LEFT 
ITS RATHER LATE TO EFFECT THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
TAX SYSTEM OBVIOUSLY ALISTAIR 
DARLING IN THE PRE BUDGET REPORT IN 
THE AUTUMN COULD SAY SOMETHING 
ABOUT NEXT YEAR THAT IS ALL I 
COULD DO HE COULD ANNOUNCE A 
CHANGE FOR NEXT YEAR THAT WOULD IN 
EFFECT COMPENSATE THE LOSERS A 
YEAR AFTER THEIR LOSSES THE KIND 
OF THINGS MIGHT LOOK AT ARE 
EXTENDING THE REACH OF TAX CREDITS 
SO THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED 
OR HE COULD THINK ABOUT INCREASING 
THE PERSONAL ALLOWANCE JUST TAKE 
MORE FAMILIES OUT OF TAX ALTOGETHER 
OR HE COULD THINK ABOUT MAKING THE 
PENSIONER'S ALLOWANCE AVAILABLE 
FROM THE AGE OF SIXTY RATHER THAN SIXTY FIVE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S TIME TO 
LOOK AT THE REST OF THE BUSINESS 
NEWS THE OUTLOOK FOR THE REST OF 
THE HOUSING MARKET AND THE HIGH 
STREET ARE BLEAK THAT IS THE 
WARNING FROM THE INFLUENTIAL PANEL 
OF ECONOMISTS KNOWN AS THE ERNST AND AMP 
YOUNG ITEM CLUB IT SAYS THE 
CONDITIONS IN THE HOUSING AND 
RETAIL MARKETS ARE SET TO GET WORSE 
AS THE INTERNATIONAL BANKING CRISIS 
STARTS TO BIT ON THE WIDER ECONOMY 
HOUSE PRICES WILL FALL BY TEN PER CENT WITH 
THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE MOVING HOME 
FALLING BY FORTY PER CENT OVER THE NEXT TWO 
YEARS MEANWHILE THE ASKING PRICES 
FOR HOMES IN ENGLAND AND WALES FELL 
BY OH ONE PER CENT DURING THE LAST MONTH 
ACCORDING TO RIGHTMOVECO.UK THOSE 
SELLING ARE FACING UP TO THE FACT 
THAT THAT HAIR HOMES ARE NO LONGER 
WORTH WHAT THEY ARE 
THEIR HOMES AFTER YEARS OF 
DECLINE THE NOTES AND COINS SEEM 
TO BE ENJOYING A RESURGENCE 
ACCORDING TO THE BRITISH RETAIL 
CONSORTIUM WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO 
GRIPS WITH THE FINANCES BY PAYING 
WITH HARD CASH THERE WAS A SURVEY 
OF SALES IN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND SHOPS IT FOUND 
THAT CASH WAS USED IN SIXTY PER CENT OF THE 
TRANSACTIONS THAT IS SIX PER CENT UP FROM 
LAST YEAR BUSINESSES ARE WASTING 
THOUSANDS OF POUNDS A YEAR BECAUSE 
OF BAD ADVICE FROM ROGUE HEALTH AND 
SAFETY CONSULTANTS M. P.'S ON THE WORK 
AND PENSIONS SELECT COMMITTEE SAY 
THE GOVERNMENT MUST INTRODUCE A 
SYSTEM OF REGULATING THEM TO STOP 
FIRMS PUTTING UNNECESSARY RED TAPE 
IN PLACE THEY ALSO WANT STIFFER 
PENALTIES FOR THOSE WHO BREACH THE 
LEGISLATION SIMON'S REPORT ON THE 
DELAYS GOT A LOT OF YOU VERY HOT 
AND BOTHERED WROTE TO TELL US 
ABOUT IT LET'S START WITH EILEEN 
KEEP THE E. MAILS COMING AS WE 
HEARD A FEW MOMENTS AGO IN THE NEWS 
THE IMPACT OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
CONTINUES TO DRIVE HOUSE PRICES 
DOWN AND THE MORTGAGE MARKET 
REMAINS EXTREMELY TIGHT WHAT WILL 
THIS MORNING'S ANNOUNCEMENT FROM 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND THAT IT WILL 
ALLOW THE HIGH STREET BANKS TO SWAP 
FIFTY BILLION OF MORTGAGES FOR 
GOVERNMENT BONS MEAN TO US ORDINARY 
CONSUMERS MAN WHO KNOWS IS ROBERT 
PESTON THE B. B. C.'S BUSINESS EDITOR 
HAVE YOU BEEN WELL ACROSS THE STORY 
YOU BROKE THE DETAIL OF THE STORY 
ON FRIDAY LET'S MOVE IT ON FROM 
THE DETAIL IN ANTICIPATE TO THAT 
QUESTION IS IT IN ANSWER TO WHAT 
WE KNOW IS IT GOING TO MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE WE NEED SOME BACKGROUND MUCH THE 
GREAT PROBLEM FOR OUR BANKS IS THEY 
ARE CHRONICALLY SHORT OF CASH THE 
REASON IS BECAUSE THEY BECAME 
DEPENDENT ON TAKING ALL OF THOSE 
MORTGAGES THEY LENT TO ALL OF US 
AND INDEED CREDIT CARD LOANS AND 
PACKAGED THEM UP INTO SECURITIES 
THEY SOLD THEM THAT BROUGHT CASH 
IN AND THEY USED THAT CASH TO LEND 
TO ALL OF US THAT MARKET FOR 
MORTGAGES INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS 
HAVE STOPPED BUYING WHAT IS KNOWN 
AS ASSET BACKED BONDS THEY HAVE 
STOPPED BUYING MORTGAGES PACKAGED 
UP INTO SECURITIES THEY HAVE 
STOPPED BUYING CREDIT CARD LOANS 
PACKAGED UP INTO SECURITIES THAT 
MEANS THERE IS LESS MONEY IN THE 
BANKING SYSTEM WHAT THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND HAS DONE IS TO REPLACE THE 
MARKETPLACE IT'S BASICALLY SAID 
IT WILL PROVIDE CASH TO THE BANKS 
THE CASH THAT INTERNATIONAL 
INVESTORS WOULDN'T DO SO WHAT 
BANKS HAVE TO DO IS TAKE ALL OF 
THOSE MORTGAGES MAKEAGE THEM UP 
AND DUMP THEM ON THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND IN RUN THEY WILL GET CASH 
WHAT THAT WILL DO THERE IS NO 
DOUBT IS EASE THE EYE CAUGHT CRISIS 
IN THE BANKING SYSTEM IT REDUCES 
THE RISK OF ANOTHER NORTHERN ROCK 
IT REDUCES THE RISK OF ANOTHER BANK 
FAILING BUT THE IMPACT ON THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET I THINK WILL BE 
QUITE IMLITTED 
I WAS 
LIMITED 
I WAS INTERESTED AS A TAXPAYER MY 
CONCERN WILL BE IF A BANK DOES 
DEFAULT I KNOW THAT IS HIGHLY 
UNLIKELY ARE WE GOING TO BE LEFT 
HOLDING THE BILL L. NOTICE THERE IS 
DIFFERENCE IN THE ASSETS THE VALUE 
OF THE ASSETS THE BANKS ARE 
PROVIDING AND THE BONDS THEY ARE 
GETTING THERE IS KIND OF ASSURANCE 
POLICY 
THERE IS TO BE CLEAR THE POLICY TREASURY IS ENDEM ANYIFYING THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND WHY IS THE 
TREASURY DOING THIS IT'S BECAUSE 
THEY DON'T WANT ANOTHER BANKING 
COLLAPSE THERE IS NO DOUBT IF 
ANOTHER BANK COLLAPSED THE HAS 
ALREADY SIGNALLED IT WOULD IT 
WOULD AMOUNT ANOTHER BAIL OUT BILL 
FOR THE TAXPAYER IN THOSE 
CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE ENORMOUS IN 
A SENSE THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT AND 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND SAYING LET'S 
PROVIDE A BIT OF TAXPAYER SUPPORT 
TO PREVENT AN EVEN GREATER CALL ON 
THE TAXPAYER IF THERE WERE A GREAT 
CRISIS THIS IS IN A SENSE A BAIL 
OUT TO PREVENT AN EVEN GREATER DLIS 
COULD REALLY CAUSE A BIG CALL ON 
TAXPAYERS AS YOU POINTED OUT 
THERE IS BIT OF PROTECTION EVEN IN 
THE EVENT THAT THIS DOESN'T PREVENT 
THAT KIND OF BANKING COLLAPSE 
THERE IS A BIT OF PROTECTION FOR 
TAXPAYERS IN THE SENSE THAT FOR 
LET'S SAY EVERY BILLION OR SO OF 
GOVERNMENT SECURITIES THAT ARE 
BEING PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT A 
BANK WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE ABOUT 
ONE POINT ONE BILLION VALUE OF MORTGAGES IN 
EXCHANGE FOR THAT THERE IS A 
MARGIN THERE THOSE MORTGAGES WOULD 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE THE MOST KA 
LAMBITOUS COLLAPSE FOR ALL OF US TO 
BE OUT OF POCKET 
I NOTICED THAT THERE IS SOMETHING 
CALLED THE HAIRCUT ON THE ASSETS L. L. 
WILL NOT ASK ABOUT THAT IT IS THE 
SORT OF QUESTION I WOULD ASK ADAM 
I AM SORRY THAT YOU ARE NOT 
QUALIFIED 
NOT MUCH OF A 
QUALIFIED NOT MUCH OF A HAIRCUT THE RISING PRICE OF GOLD 
HAS PROVIDED A MAJOR BOOST TO THE 
MINING GROUP PETER HAMBRO TODAY 
THE OIL AND MINING SECTORS HAVE 
BEEN THE BEST PERFORMING OVER THE 
PAST TWELVE MONTHS THERE IS NO BIG 
SURPRISE HERE THIS IS OVER TWELVE 
MONTHS IT WAS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR DOLLARS AN OUNCE 
ONE YEAR AGO IT WENT TO JUST OVER 
ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS BEFORE COMING OFF WE ARE 
NOW TALKING AT AROUND ABOUT NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS AN 
OUNCE THAT RISING PRICE HAS BEEN 
REFLECTED IN A RISE IN THE PROFIT 
LEVELS OF PETER HAMBRO 
THAT IS A BIG RISE TWENTY TWO PER CENT UP VERY 
NICE FOR THEM LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT 
THEIR SHARE PRICE THEY ARE DOING 
WELL FORTY SIX PER CENT UP THE MARKET WAS NOT 
EXPECTING THEM TO DO SO WELL THERE 
ARE SOME OF THE THE MINING SHARES 
HE IT IS A DIFFERENT PICTURE WITH 
THE MORE WIDELY HELD SHARES FOUR 
SHARES ARE UP AND THE REST OF THEM 
ARE DOWN 
ELSEWHERE A BIG RISE FOR THE I. T. V. 
SHARE PRICE AFTER TALKS THAT RTR A 
LUXEMBOURG BASED BROADCASTER MIGHT 
BY BSKYB'S STAKE IN THE COMPANY 
R. T. L. THE ROT BANK OF SCOTLAND HAS 
CONFIRMED THAT IT IS CONSIDERING A 
RIGHTS ISSUE ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND THAT FOLLOWS SPECULATION 
ABOUT THEIR NEED FOR CASH FOLLOWING 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IS 
DOWN TWENTY 
I AM JOINED FROM THE CITY BY 
RICHARD HUNTER LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
THAT IS THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED NOW LET'S 
LOOK AT RICHARD HE IS FROM THE 
FINANCIAL ADVISERS HARGREAVES 
LANSDOWN RICHARD THE F. T. S. E. AGE 
HAS DONE BIZARRE THINGS WE WERE 
VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IT WAS 
GOING TO DO WE HAVE SEEN SOME 
INCREASE NOW DESPITE ALL THE TALK 
ABOUT THE CREDIT CRUNCH THE MARKET 
NOW SEEMS TO BE DOING WELL WHY IS 
THAT 
IT IS REALLY A ROUND THE FACT THAT THAT THE MARKET TRIES TO BE SIX 
MONTHS AHEAD AROUND THE FACT IT 
IS TRYING TO UNRAVEL THEIR WE MIGHT 
BE IN SIX MONTHS' TIME THERE WILL 
BE A FEW POSITIVES WASHING THROUGH 
BY THEM SUCH AS THE RECENT 
INTEREST RATE CUTS WHICH USUALLY 
TAKES SIX OR FIVE MONTHS TO WASH 
THROUGH TO THE ECONOMY IN 
PERSPECTIVE THE MARKET IS STILL 
DOWN ABOUT SIX PER CENT SINCE THE FIRST JANUARY 
WE HAVE NOT QUITE RECOUP THE LOSSES 
WE HAVE HAD THAT BEING SAID WHAT 
WE MIGHT HAVE SEEN LAST WEEK WAS 
SOMETHING OF A PIVOTAL MOMENT WE 
HAD THREE BIG U. S. INVESTMENT BANKS 
REPORTING FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS 
LAST WEEK WHILST THEY WEREN'T 
PARTICULARLY GOOD NEWS AND INDEED 
THERE WAS SOME MORE SUB PRIME FALL 
OUT WRITE DOWNS THEY WERE 
ACCOMPANIED BY SOME FAIRLY STRONG 
SHARE PRICE GAINS ON TOP OF THAT 
YOU HAVE THE SITUATION WHEREBY A 
RIGHTS ISSUE IS NOT THE NEGATIVE 
NEWS IN THE MARKET WHEN A COMPANY 
GOES CAP IN HAND TO ITS 
SHAREHOLDERS FOR MORE MONEY YET 
WHEN THE SPECULATION ACCOMPANIED 
RBS ON FRIDAY SHARES FINISHED UP 
FIVE PER CENT WHAT WE MAY BE SLOWLY SEEING IS 
A SLIGHT CHANGE IN SENTIMENT THAT 
PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE A 
GLIMMER OF LIGHT AT THE END OF THE 
TUNNEL 
WHY SHOULD THE MARKET FEEL LIKE 
THAT WHEN EVERYBODY AROUND IT IS 
WORRIED WE MIGHT BE HEADING TOWARDS 
A RECESSION WHAT AN ODD TIME TO 
START PICKING UP 
IN TERMS OF THE 
U. K. I THINK IT IS FAIRLY WELL 
AGREED THAT AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IS 
LIKELY A RECESSION IS FAIRLY 
UNLIKELY AT THIS STAGE THE 
MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE WILL 
CONTINUE TO HAVE A DIFFICULT JOB 
OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS TRYING TO 
WORK OUT EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON 
IN THE HIGH STREET AND KEEPING THE 
ECONOMY TICKING OVER VERSUS THINGS 
THAT ARE LARGELY OUT OF CONTROL 
THAT IS MAINLY THE INFLATIONARY 
PRESSURES OF BOTH OIL AND FOOD 
PRICES HOWEVER IN TERMS OF THE 
WIDER MARKET WE HAVE A SITUATION 
WHEREBY IF ONE THING REALLY DOES 
NOT GO DOWN WELL IT IS UNCERTAINTY 
WE HAVE HAD MONTHS OF UNCERTAINTY 
MAINLY AROUND THE CREDIT CRUNCH AND 
THE SUB PRIME FALL OUT THEY ARE 
SOME SIGNS THAT AT LAST THIS 
CANNOT BE QUANTIFIED BEFORE THEY 
ARE QUANTIFIED FOR THE FINAL TIME 
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THE MARKET 
TO MOVE ON IN A MEANINGFUL WAY 
RICHARD YOU TALK ABOUT FUEL PRICES 
I WAS TALKING ABOUT GOLD PRICES 
THEY'RE HUGE FEATURES OF THE MARKET 
THE RISING OIL AND MINERAL COST 
IS AND THE RISE IN THE STOCK MARKET 
BASICALLY BECAUSE OF THAT ISN'T 
LOOKING AT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE 
F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED LAST YEAR IF YOU TOOK 
AWAY THE MINERS IT WOULD BE A 
TOTALLY DIFFERENT PICTURE IT IS 
KIND OF A NO WIN SITUATION WHEN 
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MARKET 
AS OFTEN AS NOT THEY ARE REFERRING 
TO THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED THEY ARE NOT 
NECESSARILY REALISING THAT LOTS OF 
OUR COMPANIES ARE VERY MUCH GLOBAL 
COMPANIES NOW THEY MAY EVEN HAVE 
EARNINGS IN DOLLARS LET ALONE BIG 
DOLLAR COMPANIES IF YOU ADD THE 
MINERS AND THE OIL TOGETHER YOU'RE 
PROBABLY LOOKING AT ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF 
THE MARKET VALUE IF YOU HAVE 
STRONG COMMODITY PRICES AND OIL 
PRICES FISHER THAT WILL HAVE A 
POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE F. T. S. E. FOR 
SURE SURE IT HAS BEEN A BUSY DAY ON THE 
ECONOMY THIS NEWS MIGHT BE 
DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE IF YOU HAVE 
READ THE GLOOMY HEADLINES KNOCKING 
AROUND TODAY LOTS OF HOMEOWNERS 
ARE ACTUALLY BETTER OFF THAN SIX 
MONTHS AGO BECAUSE OF LOWER 
INTEREST RATES THEY ARE REDUCING 
PEOPLE'S MONTHLY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS 
GET A MORTGAGE OF COURSE 
SIMON IS HERE TO EXPLAIN ONCE 
YOU GET PEOPLE ARE PAYING LESS 
BUT HOW MANY 
WE HAVE HEARD LOTS 
ABOUT THE COST OF FIXED RATE 
MORTGAGES GOING UP AND FEES BEING 
INCLUDED THAT HAVE NOT BEEN THERE 
BEFORE AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
ON VARIABLE RATE MORTGAGES AND 
THEY TEND TO BE AFFECTED BY THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND CUTTING ITS BASE 
RATE LET'S LOOK AT THE NUMBERS 
INVOLVED THE BANK BASE RATE HAS 
COME DOWN BY OH SEVEN FIVE PER CENT SINCE DECEMBER 
IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IS 
INFLUENCED BY THE BANK BASE RATE 
THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY INVOLVED 
COMING BACK INTO THE ECONOMY SO TO 
SPEAK REMEMBER WHAT RICHARD HUNTER 
WAS SAYING ABOUT THE EFFECT OF 
INTEREST RATE CUTS BENEFITING THE 
ECONOMY THAT IS AROUND THREE HUNDRED 
MILLION A MONTH JUST HOW PEOPLE 
ARE AFFECTED DEPENDS A BIT ON WHAT 
SORT OF VARIABLE RATE MORTGAGE THEY 
HAVE LET'S LOOK AT HOW IT SPLITS 
UP A BASE RATE TRACKER HAS AN 
IMMEDIATE IMPACT FROM THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND CUTTING ITS BASE RATE 
THE STANDARD BEARER VARIABLE RATE 
IS BASICALLY A MANAGED RATE THEY 
DON'T HAVE TO MOVE IT ALONG WITH 
THE BANK BASE RATE BUT 
TRADITIONALLY THEY HAVE THE 
SITUATION THERE IS THAT NOT ALL OF 
THEM HAVE THE QUESTION IS IT IS 
YOUR LENDER IF THEY HAVEN'T MOVED 
IT ALREADY LIKELY TO MOVE DOWN THE 
STANDARD VARIABLE RATE L. SPOKE TO 
A MORTGAGE BROKER FOR ANSWERS ON 
THAT 
THE LENDERS WHO HAVE PASSED THAT THE LAST RATE CUT IN FULL BROADLY 
SPEAKING ARE THOSE WHO HAD VERY 
FEW BORROWERS ON STANDARD VARIABLE 
RATE OR DISCOUNT THE BUILDING 
SOCIETIES IN PARTICULAR TEND TO 
OFFER A NEW MORTGAGE RATES AS A 
DISCOUNT TO STANDARD VARIABLE RATE 
RATHER THAN MAKE TRACKER BASIS IT 
IS IN THEIR INTEREST MORE THAN 
OTHER LENDERS TO NOT PASS THE RATE 
CUT ON IN FULL BECAUSE THEY WILL 
GET THE BENEFIT OF NOT DOING SO 
THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE THAT LOTS OF 
THE LENDERS WHO HAVE SO FAR NOT 
ANNOUNCED A CHANGE IN THEIR 
STANDARD VARIABLE RATE AFTER THE 
BANK RATE CUT WILL BE THE ONES WHO 
WILL CHOOSE NOT TO PASS IT ON A 
TOUR OR NOT IN FULL 
THE PROBLEM 
IS THAT IF THE LENDERS DON'T PASS 
ON THE RATE OR THE RATE DROPS 
EVEN VARIABLE MORTGAGES WILL BE 
AFFECTED 
NATIONWIDE AND HALIFAX AFFECTED HAVE PASSED IT ON THESE ONES HAVE 
NOT HOWEVER 
LOTS OF SMALLER BUILDING SOCIETIES 
AS WELL WE NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR 
THEM IF THE FULL EFFECT OF THE 
VARIABLE RATES COMING DOWN WORLD BE 
ONE TO SEE 
DONNA HUTCHINGS SAYS 
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE U. K. HOUSING 
STOCK IS ACTUALLY MORTGAGE BY 
TAKING OUT COUNCIL HOUSES AND THOSE 
OF US LUCKY ENOUGH TO OWN OUR HOMES 
OUTRIGHT WHAT PERCENTAGE IS LEFT 
THAT WOULD BE A MORE ACCURATE 
FIGURE 
IT IS A REALLY GOOD FIGURE QUESTION I CAN GIVE YOU A GOOD 
ANSWER BRIEFLY TO THAT THERE ARE 
NEARLY TWELVE HUNDRED MILLION TWELVE MILLION 
MORTGAGES OUT THERE BUT TWENTY SIX MILLION 
HOMES OFFER DIFFERENT NEARLY SEVEN 
MILLION ARE OWNER OCCUPIERS WHO 
HAVE PAID THEIR MORTGAGE OFF OR 
DON'T HAVE A MORTGAGE THOSE PEOPLE 
WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THE 
INTEREST RATE OR MORTGAGE COSTS 
THE OTHERS ARE PEOPLE IN SOCIAL 
HOUSING OR IN PRIVATE RENTED 
ACCOMMODATION ETC THERE ARE TWELVE 
MILLION MORTGAGES AND TWENTY SIX MILLION 
DWELLINGS

BRITAIN'S HONEY BEES COULD ALL DIE 
OUT IN JUST TEN YEARS THAT GRIM 
WARNING COMES FROM BEE EXPERTS WHO 
WANT EIGHT MILLION FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
TO RESEARCH THE VIRUSES THAT COULD 
BE KILLING THEM OFF HONEY BEES 
PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN THE ECONOMY BY 
HELPING TO POLLINATE MANY FOODS 
RICHARD WESTCOTT REPORTS 
THIS HIVE SHOULD BE BUZZING WITH 
ACTIVITY DRIPPING WITH NECTAR 
THEY ARE ALL DEAD 
THE ONLY BEES 
LEFT TO LIVE ART ROBBERS FROM OTHER 
COLONIES WATCH THEM STEAL THE LAST 
OF THE FOOD 
WHAT IS CONCERNING TO 
ME IS THAT WHATEVER VIRUS IS 
PREVALENT HERE COULD NOW BE IN 
THESE TWO HIVES 
BEEKEEPERS EXPECT 
SOME LOSSES OVER THE WINTER BUT 
LAST YEAR AROUND ONE IN FIVE HIVES 
FAILED THEY WORRY THAT THIS YEAR 
WILL BE THE SAME EXPERTS LIKE 
CHRIS PAINT A GRIM PICTURE WE WE COULD WELL BE LOOKING AT THE 
EXTINCTION OF HONEY BEES IN THE U. K. 
IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED ALREADY IS THAT MANAGE 
COLONIES ARE DECLINING WE KNOW 
THAT THE NUMBER OF WILD COLONIES 
HAS ALMOST DROPPED TO ZERO L. FEAR 
WE ARE ON THE EDGE OF SOMETHING 
THAT WILL NOT BECOME APPARENT UNTIL 
THE CONSEQUENCES ARE IRREVERSIBLE 
THAT IS WHY THEY WANT THE 
GOVERNMENT TO SPEND EIGHT MILLION 
FINDING OUT EXACTLY WHAT IS KILLING 
THEM OFF WHY ARE HONEY BEES SO 
IMPORTANT HOW DO THEY AFFECT YOUR 
LIFE LOOK AROUND YOUR KITCHEN AND 
BATHROOM SO MANY THINGS RELY ON 
POLLINATING HONEY BEES SUPERFOODS 
LIKE BROCCOLI AND BLUEBERRIES KIWI 
FRUIT AND ALMONDS COTTON TOO AND 
ONIONS IN FACT IT IS ESTIMATED 
THAT HONEY BEES PLAY A PART IN ONE 
THIRD OF THE THINGS WE EAT 
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE WORRYING 
APIARISTS LIKE CHRIS AND COLIN 
COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER HAS 
RAVAGED HIVES IN AMERICA YET NO 
ONE KNOWS WHAT IS CAUSING IT OR 
WHETHER IT WILL END UP HERE THE U. S. 
GOVERNMENT IS SPENDING MILLIONS OF 
POUNDS ON RESEARCH SPENDING 
MILLIONS HAAGEN DAZS HAS CHIPPED 
IN SAYING AROUND HALF OF ITS 
FLAVOURS WOULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT 
THE HONEY BEE HOW WORRIED ARE YOU 
ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN AMERICA 
WE ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING BECAUSE IT IS VERY 
POSSIBLE THAT IT COULD TRANSLATE 
INTO THE U. K. THE BEES OF THE SAME 
AS ARE MANY OF THE BEEKEEPING 
PRACTICES 
BEEKEEPERS CLAIMED THAT PRACTICES IF WE LOSE THIS VITAL LINK IN THE 
FOOD CHAIN OUR MOST EFFICIENT 
POLLINATOR WILL NEED MORE IMPACT 
IMPORTS AND FOOD PRICES WILL SOAR 
OUR MOST IMPORTANT POLLINATOR WE 
WILL NEED MORE 
NEVER MIND THE BEES WHAT ABOUT THE 
GOVERNMENT THEY ARE ROBBING THE 
POOR TO PAY FOR THE RICH WE 
COULDN'T POSSIBLY COMMENT SEE YOU 
TOMORROW GOODBYE
