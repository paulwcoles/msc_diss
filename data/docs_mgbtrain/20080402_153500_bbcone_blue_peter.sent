MORE IDEAS FOR WHAT YOU CAN DO IN THE HOLIDAYS 
SO SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE RIDE 
I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE SCHOOL HOLIDAYS 
SO WE'VE COME TO THE WEST MIDLAND SAFARI PARK TO SEE SOME WILDLIFE 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RIGHT GIRAFFE TODAY OH DRIVE ON 
ALSO COMING UP ON TODAY'S PROGRAM 
I VISIT THE MOST FAMOUS HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY 
I FREEZE IN THE BRECON BEACONS 
AND I TRY OUT BOARDING MOUNTAIN STYLEE IN NORTH DEVON 
BUT FIRST BACK TO THE SAFARI PARK 
AND ALL RIGHT SON I SEE YOU'VE MADE FRIENDS WITH THE LOCALS YEAH 
THIS IS MY NEW FRIEND FIVE HELLO FIVE 
AFRICAN ELEPHANT AND IT ACTUALLY PAINTS ON COMMAND 
REALLY BASICALLY THE KEEPERS OIL THEIR TOENAILS 
ONE DAY THEY'D LEFT A BRUSH FOR THE TOENAILS ON THE FLOOR 
AND SHE PICKED IT UP AND STARTED DOING THE MOTION 
HELLO ALL RIGHT TIME TO DO YOUR THING 
NO BRUSH 
ALL RIGHT PAINT 
ALL RIGHT BUCKET BRUSH THAT IS THE FUNNIEST THING I'VE SEEN 
ALL RIGHT PAINT 
ALL RIGHT BUCKET BRUSH 
OH I SEE WHAT SHE'S DOING THERE YEAH 
WE'RE GOING TO JUDGE THIS I'LL GIVE YOURS A THREE OUT OF FIVE 
COOL I'LL GIVE FIVE FIVE OUT OF FIVE GET IN FIVE WELL DONE 
AND FROM BEING ARTY TO KARATE 
NOW TO WALES AND THE BRECON BEACONS FOR A WORKOUT WITH A DIFFERENCE 
I AM HERE IN THE BRECON BEACONS IT IS SO WET AND COLD 
BUT IT'S ABOUT TO GET A LOT MORE WET AND A LOT MORE COLD 
I'M JOINED BY OVER ONE HUNDRED YOUNG KARATE EXPERTS 
THEY'RE TAKING ME ON SOME EXTREME TRAINING THROUGH THIS FOREST 
WE'RE RUNNING FOR A MILE STOPPING EVERY SO OFTEN TO DO MOVES 
THEN WHEN WE GET TO THE TOP WE'RE GOING TO GO UNDER A WATERFALL 
AND DO EVEN MORE KARATE CRAZY BUT TRUE YES SIR 
EARLIER THAT DAY I JOINED THE PONTYPRIDD AND LLANTRISANT SCHOOL 
OF KYOKUSHINKAI KARATE 
WHO TAKE THEIR TRAINING VERY SERIOUSLY 
LOUDER 
LOUDER 
LOUDER 
MORGAN WHY IS IT SO NOISY 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE Q. I. WHAT'S Q. I. 
IT MEANS SHOUT FROM WITHIN 
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SHOUT FROM WITHIN TO HELP YOU BREATHE 
M. M. M. SO IT'S ALL ABOUT BREATHING O. K. 
RIGHT KYLE AND AISHA PLEASE 
KYOKUSHINKAI KARATE IS ROOTED IN A PHILOSOPHY OF SELF IMPROVEMENT 
DISCIPLINE AND HARD TRAINING 
IT WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR BY MASUTATSU OYAMA IN JAPAN 
OYAMA USED TO TRAIN FOR TWELVE HOURS A DAY 
PRACTISING KARATE ROUTINES OR MEDITATION UNDER WATERFALLS 
MIND OVER MATTER WAS HIS PHILOSOPHY 
THAT'S GOOD 
IF YOU WANT TO TRY IT OUT FIND AN EXPERT LIKE STEVEN 
THAT'S IT 
AND NOW REST 
WHAT IS THIS FINAL THING 
IT'S JUST TO COMPLETE THE END OF THE MOVES 
JUST COME BACK TO A BASIC STANCE READY FOR THE NEXT MOVE RIGHT 
STEVEN IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST GRADES A BLACK BELT 
AND HAS TRAINED IN KYOKUSHINKAI KARATE FOR OVER EIGHTEEN YEARS 
BEING THIS EXPERIENCED ENABLES STEVEN TO DO SOME IMPRESSIVE 
BUT DANGEROUS TECHNIQUES 
AH 
THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING YOU SHOULDN'T TRY AT HOME 
GUYS THAT WAS FANTASTIC YOU'RE ALL SO GOOD 
I'VE GOT SO MUCH TO LEARN 
WE'RE NOT FINISHED YET OH IT MUST BE WATERFALL TIME 
I HOPE I CAN REMEMBER IT ALL 
AS WE JOGGED WE SHOUTED YASHU 
A NOISE THAT HAS TO COME FROM THE STOMACH 
IT'S SUPPOSED TO HELP FOCUS YOUR MIND 
AND IN OUR CASE FORGET ABOUT THE COLD 
YASHU 
I HAD NO IDEA DOING KARATE MEANT GETTING THIS DIRTY 
IF THIS IS THE CASE WHY DO YOU WEAR WHITE CLOTHING 
SO ADAM WHY DO YOU LOVE KARATE 
BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU CONFIDENCE 
AND IT'S A GOOD DISCIPLINE AND IT KEEPS YOU FIT 
AND WHY ARE WE IN THE FOREST DOING THE TRAINING HERE 
I THINK IT TOUGHENS YOU UP A BIT 
I THINK WE'RE NEAR TO THE WATERFALL 
HAVE YOU ANY TIPS FOR ME WHEN WE GET UP THERE 
WHEN WE GET UP THERE JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN 
IN CASE WATER GOES INTO YOUR FACE BECAUSE IT MIGHT STING A BIT O. K. 
THIS EXTREME WATERFALL TRAINING TAKES PLACE ONCE A YEAR 
THE ONLY SAFE WAY TO DO IT IS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A KARATE CLUB 
WHY ARE WE ACTUALLY HAVING TO DO THE KARATE MOVES UNDER THE WATERFALL 
IT'S MIND OVER MATTER IT'S GETTING THE MIND TO BUILD UP A GOOD SPIRIT 
SO WHEN YOU HAVE TO PUSH YOURSELF IN FIGHTING OR TRAINING 
YOU'VE GOT THE SPIRIT THERE 
YOU'RE ONLY A WHITE BELT YOU'LL ONLY DO A SHORT TIME UNDER 
BUT THE WATERFALL'S WAITING AWAY WE GO HOW LONG IS A SHORT TIME 
YOU'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH 
LOOK AT ALL THESE PEOPLE THEY'RE ALL MAD 
IT WOULDN'T BE SO BAD IF IT WAS A HOT SUNNY DAY 
BUT IT IS ACTUALLY FREEZING 
MIND OVER MATTER MIND OVER MATTER 
LOTS OF OOSH AND I SHOULD BE FINE 
AS MY TURN GREW CLOSER THERE WAS ONE THING I COULDN'T FORGET 
HOW LONG IS A SHORT TIME YOU'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH 
BEING UNDER THE FREEZING WATERFALL WAS SOMETHING I THOUGHT I'D HATE 
BUT I HAD A SURPRISE IN STORE FOR EVERYONE 
HERE CAN YOU LET ME DO MORE THAN I'M SUPPOSED TO DO 
CAN YOU LET ME DO THE SAME AS A BROWN BELT 
I WAS ONLY A BEGINNER 
BUT WANTED TO DO THE SAME NUMBER OF PUNCHES AS A BROWN BELT 
HERE I GO OH 
AH 
OOSH OOSH OOSH 
OOSH OOSH OOSH 
OOSH OOSH OOSH 
OOSH OOSH OOSH 
OOSH OOSH OOSH 
OOSH OOSH OOSH OOSH OOSH 
I DID AN INCREDIBLE FORTY PUNCHES 
MY HEAD IS FREEZING OH MY GOSH ICE CREAM HEAD ICE CREAM HEAD 
IT'S JUST LIKE IT GETS SO COLD YOUR WHOLE HEAD FREEZES OVER 
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GO OOSH OOSH OOSH 
YOU RUN OUT OF BREATH BECAUSE IT'S SO COLD IT TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY 
I SHOULD DO THAT EVERY MORNING 
I CERTAINLY WORKED UP AN APPETITE BUT WASN'T THE ONLY ONE 
BACK TO THE BOYS DAY OUT AT THE SAFARI PARK TIME FOR LUNCH 
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY 
THESE ARE WHITE LIONS AND THEY ORIGINATE FROM SOUTH AFRICA 
THE THING IS THERE'S ONLY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY OF THESE LEFT IN THE WORLD 
AND THEY'RE LOOKING HUNGRY GETH HOW YOU GETTING ON MATE 
YEAH WE'VE JUST GOT INTO A RATHER FRIGHTENING POSITION 
I'M SURROUNDED BY WHITE LIONS 
THERE ARE THIRTEEN OF THEM HERE AT THE SAFARI PARK 
NINE OF WHICH ARE THE FIRST EVER TO BE BORN IN THE U. K. 
FOR A WHITE LION TO BE BORN IT'S MUM AND DAD MUST HAVE THE SAME GENE 
THAT GENE IS VERY RARE AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THESE CREATURES SPECIAL 
THEY'RE PACING FROM SIDE TO SIDE I THINK THEY WANT SOME FOOD 
THAT'S RAW MEAT 
THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS THE MALE HAS FIRST SAY ON THE FOOD 
IF HE DOESN'T WANT IT HE LETS THE FEMALE HAVE A GO AT IT 
ONLY WHEN THE FEMALE'S FINISHED WITH THE FOOD DO THE CUBS GET A LOOK IN 
I WOULDN'T MESS WITH HIM WOULD YOU 
THE LION MAY BE KING OF THE JUNGLE BUT TRUE ROYALTY NEEDS A PALACE 
OUR NEXT GREAT DAY OUT IS BUCKINGHAM PALACE LONDON 
HER MAJESTY'S OFFICIAL HOME 
THE QUEEN VISITED OUR HOME AS PART OF THE GOLDEN JUBILEE CELEBRATIONS 
WHEN SHE CAME TO LOOK ROUND THE BLUE PETER STUDIO 
TODAY SHE'S KINDLY AGREED TO ALLOW ME AND YOU 
TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AROUND HER HOME 
ORIGINALLY BELONGING TO THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM 
BUCKINGHAM HOUSE AS IT WAS THEN KNOWN WAS BOUGHT IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY ONE 
BY KING GEORGE THE THIRD AS A PRIVATE RESIDENCE FOR HIS WIFE 
BUILDING AND LAVISH REDECORATION BEGAN 
TURNING THIS EIGHTEENTH CENTURY TOWN HOUSE INTO A PALACE FIT FOR A KING 
HOWEVER THE FIRST BRITISH MONARCH TO ACTUALLY LIVE AND RULE FROM HERE 
WAS QUEEN VICTORIA IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN 
AT FIRST SHE WAS VERY HAPPY WITH HER NEW HOME 
DECLARING I DELIGHT IN BUCKINGHAM PALACE 
HOWEVER ALONG WITH HER HUSBAND PRINCE ALBERT 
SHE QUICKLY DISCOVERED THERE WERE PROBLEMS 
THE ROYAL APARTMENT SMELT OF THE SEWERS 
SOME DOORS WOULDN'T CLOSE SOME WINDOWS WOULDN'T OPEN 
AND THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH ROOMS 
SO THE ROYAL COUPLE SET ABOUT TURNING THE PALACE 
INTO A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD LIVE AND WORK 
INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF THE NOW FAMOUS EAST WING AT THE FRONT 
WHICH PROVIDED THE MUCH NEEDED EXTRA SPACE 
TO DO THIS A GIGANTIC MARBLE ARCH THAT STOOD IN THE PALACE FORECOURT 
HAD TO BE MOVED TO ITS PRESENT HOME AT THE CORNER OF HYDE PARK 
THERE WERE ALSO PROBLEMS WITH SOME OF THE STATE ROOMS 
INCLUDING THIS ONE WHICH WAS USED AS A BALLROOM 
IT WAS TOO SMALL FOR ALL THE GUESTS 
AND IT GOT HOT BECAUSE OF ALL THE CANDLES THEY USED TO LIGHT IT 
NOT TO MENTION THE WAX THAT DRIPPED ONTO THE GUESTS' HAIR AND CLOTHES 
A NEW BALLROOM WAS BUILT IT'S THE LARGEST OF THE NINETEEN STATE ROOMS 
USED THESE DAYS FOR STATE BANQUETS AND INVESTITURES 
WHEN PEOPLE COME TO RECEIVE THEIR OBES AND OTHER HONOURS 
AT THE ONE END THERE ARE TWO THRONES 
AT THIS END THERE'S A MUSICIANS GALLERY WITH THIS GRAND ORGAN 
WHICH I'VE BEEN GIVEN SPECIAL PERMISSION TO PLAY 
THERE WAS NO T. V. OR RADIO 
SO MUSIC WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO VICTORIA AND ALBERT 
FAMOUS MUSICIANS AND COMPOSERS OFTEN VISITED AND PLAYED FOR THE COUPLE 
THIS IS THE PALACE'S MUSIC ROOM 
WHERE PRIVATE CONCERTS STILL TAKE PLACE 
IT'S ALSO BEEN USED FOR SEVERAL ROYAL CHRISTENINGS 
INCLUDING PRINCE CHARLES AND PRINCE WILLIAM 
ANOTHER ATTRACTION AT THE PALACE IS THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD 
WHILE ON DUTY GUARDS HAVE TO STAND COMPLETELY STILL FOR TWO HOURS 
WITHOUT BEING DISTRACTED BY THINGS GOING ON AROUND THEM 
JUST TO SEE HOW HARD A JOB THAT IS I'VE COME BACK TO STAND GUARD 
OUTSIDE MY HOME THE BLUE PETER STUDIO AT TELEVISION CENTRE 
WAIT RIGHT HERE 
I'M STILL STANDING BY ELTON JOHN 
I DIDN'T KNOW THE OTHERS HAD PLANNED A FEW DISTRACTIONS FOR ME 
I'M STILL STANDING 
AFTER ALL THIS TIME 
PICKING UP THE PIECES OF MY LIFE WITHOUT YOU ON MY MIND 
I'M STILL STANDING 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
I'M STILL STANDING 
OH 
DEAR ME 
I'M ABSOLUTELY FREEZING 
BUT I DID IT 
OOH 
SO I'M GOING TO DITCH THIS WELSH GUARDS UNIFORM 
AND GO AND GET A WELSH CAKE AND A HOT DRINK 
THIS IS SOLDIER JONES SIGNING OFF DUTY 
A BIG ATTRACTION OF ANY SAFARI PARK ARE THE NEWBORN ANIMALS 
THIS IS AMBER 
SHE'S AN AXIS DEER AND SHE'S ONLY FOUR WEEKS OLD 
SHE ORIGINATES FROM ASIA 
SHE'S IN HERE BECAUSE SHE CAN'T COPE WITH THE COLD OUTSIDE 
SHE'LL STAY HERE TILL SHE'S STRONGER AND ABLE TO JOIN THE REST

JUST TO GIVE YOU AN APPRECIATION OF WHAT'S INVOLVED 
GOODNESS YOU WERE REALLY CLOSE TO THAT 
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT I'LL BE DOING SPEEDS LIKE THIS 
IT JUST SEEMS SO DANGEROUS 
BEFORE BEING ALLOWED ONTO THE TRACK I GOT TO GRIPS WITH THE BASICS 
IN A SIMULATOR WHICH IS USED BY PROFESSIONAL FORMULA ONE DRIVERS 
THE DOTTED LINE DOWN THE ROAD INDICATES WHERE THE RACING LINE IS 
RACING LINE ON A RACING CIRCUIT OPENS UP THE CORNER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 
TO KEEP THE CAR NICE AND FREE A LOT OF CONCENTRATING INVOLVED YES
