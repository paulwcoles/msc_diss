SHE WAS FOUND BY THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE ON THE NINETEENTH OF AUGUST NINETEEN NINETY THREE IN A DISUSED CONTAINER YARD 
SO THE OWNER OF THE D. N. A. ON THE CHAINS IN THE CONTAINER 
AND THAT'S THE TRAIN STATION WOMAN 
IS EITHER THE KILLER OR A WITNESS TO THE MURDER OF TWENTY SEVEN B. 
PACK WHAT 
MY CHILDREN ARE IN DANGER AND I THINK YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT MY WIFE THAN I DO 
SHE'S ALIVE AND ON THE RUN HE CALLED HIMSELF DOUBLE B. 
SO WE'VE GOT THIS PIMP ALGERIAN DOUBLE B. 
I NEED YOUR HELP WHY ELSE WOULD YOU BE HERE 
YOU'VE GOT THESE PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR THE LIBERATION OF THEIR COUNTRIES 
YOU'VE GOT THE I. N. L. A. HERE IRELAND FIS ALGERIA AND THE BASQUE SEPARATISTS E. T. A. RIGHT 
WHO ARE YOU HAS SHE GOT MY CHILDREN 
I THINK THIS IS THE IRISH WOMAN UNA'S RETRIBUTION ON LORE FOR THE DEATH OF HER BROTHER 
SEAN 
THAT YOUNG MALE YOU WERE TRYING TO LOCATE HE'S GOING TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A PSYCHIATRIC UNIT 
I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT YOUR WIFE IS NOT FRENCH 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE'S BASQUE FRENCH BASQUE FROM BAYONNE 
I TOLD YOU YEAH RIGHT AND I THINK THAT SHE WAS INVOLVED WITH AN ORGANISATION CALLED E. T. A. 
E. T. A. E. T. A. YES E. T. A. I'M PRESUMING YOU KNOW WHAT E. T. A. IS YES 
IT'S A TERRORIST ORGANISATION WITH LINKS TO THE I. R. A. THEY'VE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ATROCITIES 
BOMBINGS ASSASSINATIONS CAR BOMBS ARE THEIR SPECIALITY 
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS 
YOU DON'T 
I JUST DON'T THINK YOU'RE TELLING ME THE TRUTH YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T TRUST YOU 
WE TELL YOU WE HAVE D. N. A. EVIDENCE THAT YOUR WIFE WAS HERE IN THE 
UNITED KINGDOM IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA YOU HAVE NO MEMORY OF THAT 
AN IRISH WOMAN COMES TO YOUR HOUSE SHE TARGETS YOU AND YOUR WIFE 
AND YOU CLAIM YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE WHO SHE IS 
YOUR WIFE WAS INVOLVED IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU 
DIDN'T KNOW YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION I KNOW ABOUT HER PAST 
SHE TOOK ME TO THE PLACE WHERE SHE WAS BORN WHERE SHE GREW UP I MET HER FAMILY 
I TOLD YOU SHE WAS A WAITRESS WHEN I MET HER 
YOU SAY SHE'S BEEN IN ENGLAND BEFORE I HAD NO IDEA 
SHE WAS A WAITRESS IN BAYONNE AND NOW SHE'S A NURSE HERE AND A WIFE AND A MOTHER A FANTASTIC MOTHER 
WE ARE HAPPILY MARRIED 
YOU'RE LYING TO ME I SWEAR 
I SWEAR ON THE LIVES OF MY KIDS I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE JUST TOLD ME 
I THINK HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH 
WELL THEN MAYBE WE'RE WRONG AND SHE NEVER EVER WAS A TERRORIST AT ALL NO I THINK SHE PROBABLY WAS 
WHAT AND HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN BE WITH SOMEONE 
FOR YEARS AND NOT KNOW THEY'RE LIVING A COMPLETE LIE NOT KNOW THEM AT ALL I DON'T BUY THAT

LISTEN TO YOUR SISTER 
SO THE MITOCHONDRIAL D. N. A. CONFIRMS THAT TERESE IS NOT LORE'S DAUGHTER 
ONLY LINDA IS LORE'S DAUGHTER TERESE AND LINDA ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY THEY'RE NOT SISTERS 
AND THE BLOOD ON THE TOWEL IN THE HOTEL YOU CONFIRM BELONGS TO UNA DOYLE YEAH 
THIS CONFUSES ME BECAUSE WE'VE ASSUMED THAT UNA IS TAKING REVENGE ON LORE BY KIDNAPPING HER CHILDREN 
DOES SHE KNOW THAT TERESE IS NOT LORE'S KID IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER SHE KNOWS 
THE FAMILY HAVE BONDED THEY'VE BEEN A UNIT FOR TEN YEARS 
SO SHE'S TAKING RETRIBUTION ON WHAT SHE BELIEVES TO BE THE FAMILY 
YES SHE TRIED TO BLOW UP THE FAMILY HOME WITH STEPHEN IN IT 
WE'VE GOT AN ADDRESS FOR BRAHIM HADDOU I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE 
BUT MY FEAR IS IF THEY'RE STILL ALIVE OH PLEASE DON'T GO THERE 
THAT THE OLDER GIRL MAY TRY AND PROTECT THE YOUNGER GIRL BY TAKING CONTROL OF THE SITUATION 
SHE MAY BECOME VOLATILE UNPREDICTABLE HOT HEADED LIKE HER MOTHER NOT LIKE HER MOTHER 
IT'S NATURE SLASH NURTURE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
THE THING THAT MATTERS IS THAT THERE'S TWO KIDS IN THE HANDS OF A RUTHLESS TERRORIST RIGHT MM 
SO WE NEED TO DISCOVER WHO IS THE REAL MOTHER OF TERESE 
HOLD IT THERE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO KILL YOU

YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A WHORE 
YOU THINK BECAUSE YOUR DADDY WAS SHOT THAT MAKES YOU SOMETHING KNEEL 
MAYBE YOUR MAMA SLEPT WITH FRANCO'S PIGS DON'T LET HIM IN

SHE'S DOWN 
ARE YOU O. K. I'M SO SORRY FATIMA 
THAT'S O. K. JUST GET UP SO THIS WOMAN 
FATIMA 
SO SHE'S NOT MY MOTHER'S REAL SISTER OR YOURS 
WHAT DOES REAL MEAN 
YOU CAN'T CHOOSE THE FAMILY YOU'RE BORN WITH NO MORE THAN YOU CAN CHOOSE THE WORLD YOU'RE BORN INTO 
SO WHAT ARE YOU I. R. A. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YEAH I READ ABOUT YOU LOT IN HISTORY CLASS DID I HAVE NICE BIG HORNS ON MY HEAD AND A TAIL OUT ME ARSE 
YEAH YOU DID GOOD 
SO HAVE YOU KILLED PEOPLE 
YES 
HOW MANY 
TOO MANY 
WELL WHY 
BECAUSE EVERY PERSON EVEN YOU REACHES A POINT IN THEIR LIFE WHEN THEY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR THE WORLD THEY LIVE IN AND THEY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ENDURE IT 
OR YOU OPPOSE IT CHANGE IT 
SO WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO CHANGE 
THE SAME THING AS YOUR MOTHER AND FATIMA 
THE OCCUPATION OF OUR LANDS BY FOREIGN ARMIES 
THE RIGHTS OF OUR INDIGENOUS PEOPLES TO SELF DETERMINATION BUT NOT ANY MORE 
NOW YOU'RE JUST OUT FOR REVENGE RIGHT 
PASS ME THE SCREWDRIVER WILL YOU 
ERM 
WHAT SCREWDRIVER 
THE ONE UP YOUR SLEEVE 
WELL 
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE A DECISION TO MAKE DOESN'T IT 
IF YOU COULD ACT NOW AND KILL ME YOU COULD END IT 
OR COULD YOU AND WHAT IF YOU MISS 
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE 
IF YOU ATTACK ME NOW WITH THAT YOU'LL LOSE 
AND NOT BECAUSE I'M RIGHT AND YOU'RE WRONG 
BUT BECAUSE I'M STRONGER AND BETTER TRAINED 
I'LL KILL YOU AND YOUR SISTER WILL BE LEFT ALONE 
YOU PLUNGE IT STRAIGHT INTO THE EAR CANAL WHAT 
AND IF YOU CAN'T GET THE EAR GO THROUGH THE EYE 
THANKS I'LL REMEMBER THAT 
AYE I KNOW YOU WILL 
BUT KNOWLEDGE IS NOTHING WITHOUT THE CONVICTION TO USE IT 
WE'VE GOT TWO FILES HERE WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO START WITH 
THIS ONE IS THE DOMESTIC CRIME FILE FROM THE ALGERIAN POLICE 
IT SAYS HERE THAT YOU WORKED YOUR WAY UP FROM PETTY CRIME AS A CHILD 
NICE 
AND THIS IS YOUR INTERPOL FILE 
SO BRAHIM HADDOU YOU'RE A MEMBER OF AN ALGERIAN TERRORIST 
GROUP FIS KNOWN AS FEECE AND YOU WERE SENTENCED TO DEATH IN ABSENTIA FOR BOMBING AN AIRPORT 
WHY DID THE ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT DO YOU THAT FAVOUR 
WHAT FAVOUR THEY MUST'VE KNOWN WHEN THEY SENTENCED YOU TO DEATH THAT NO EUROPEAN COUNTRY 
WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO EXTRADITE YOU BACK TO ALGERIA 
SO THE DEATH SENTENCE WAS A FREE TICKET FOR YOU TO LIVE ANYWHERE IN EUROPE I DON'T KNOW 
YOU DON'T KNOW 
YOU DON'T KNOW SIXTEENTH OF OCTOBER NINETEEN NINETY TWO YOU WERE ARRESTED AT ELEVEN HUNDRED HOURS WITH LORE DUTANA 
YOU WERE HELD FOR THREE DAYS THEN RELEASED 
YES WHY DID THEY RELEASE YOU 
THEY COULDN'T PROVE ANYTHING WHERE DID YOU GO WHEN YOU WERE RELEASED 
WHY AM I HERE OH GOD TAKE YOUR PICK 
PEOPLE TRAFFICKING PIMPING CHILD PROSTITUTION DOES IT MATTER 
YOU'RE MAINLY HERE BRAHIM TO GIVE ME INFORMATION WHICH SO FAR YOU HAVE COMPLETELY FAILED TO DO 
I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY 
NOTHING MORE TO SAY 
STELLA 
WHY IS SHE HERE 
SHE HAS SOMETHING PERSONAL THAT SHE WANTS TO SORT OUT WITH YOU AND AS YOU'RE NO LONGER ANY USE TO ME 
BRAHIM HADDOU SHE CAN HAVE YOU 
ALL YOURS 
ON YOUR FEET 
SO YOU HAVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE ON HER I HAVE TWO I ONLY WANT ONE 
WELL THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE SITTING IN THAT ROOM 
THE FIRST ONE WAS A YOUNG GIRL OF TEN WHO SAW HER FATHER 
KILLED BY A PARAMILITARY DEATH SQUAD BECAUSE HE WAS A MEMBER OF E. T. A. 
SO HE WAS A TERRORIST AS WELL 
I IMAGINE HER FATHER'S COMRADES TOOK HER UNDER THEIR WING 
WITH ALL THAT GRIEF AND ANGER IT WOULD'VE BEEN EASY FOR THEM TO GROOM HER AS A TERRORIST 
SO WHEN SHE WAS ACTIVE AS A TERRORIST WHAT SORT OF ATROCITIES WAS SHE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
WELL NOT QUITE WHAT YOU'D EXPECT 
SPANISH POLICE SENT ME THIS FILE AND 
THERE SHE IS 
THIS IS THE SPANISH DIPLOMAT WHO WAS KIDNAPPED AND MURDERED 
NOW THE POLICE BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD AN AFFAIR WITH HIM TO ENABLE HER TO GET HIM ALONE 
SO THEY USED HER AS A HONEY TRAP 
YES OF COURSE THAT'S WHO SHE WAS THEN 
AND NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS HER AS A NURSE YES 
A MIDDLE CLASS HOUSEWIFE WITH CHILDREN 
CHILDREN SHE IS DESPERATE TO SAVE 
SO WHAT FACE DO YOU THINK SHE'S GOING TO PRESENT TO US TODAY 
STEPHEN WANTS TO TALK TO LORE IS THAT A GOOD IDEA OR A BAD IDEA 
THAT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA THAT'S A BAD IDEA 
SHE HAS SPENT LITERALLY THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS RUNNING AWAY FROM HER PAST 
SHE'S NOT GOING TO WANT TO REVISIT IT AND ESPECIALLY NOT IN THE COMPANY OF HER HUSBAND 
BUT I WANT TO TALK TO HER AS A TERRORIST AND FIND OUT THE CONNECTION WITH TWENTY SEVEN B. 
I NEED TO REVISIT THAT HOW AM I GOING TO DO THAT WELL WITH DELICACY AND TACT 
I WANT TO KNOW THE INFORMATION SHOULDN'T YOU BE FINDING MY GIRLS 
WE ARE BUT I WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WE WERE WAITING FOR A TRAIN 
AND A GUY JUMPED ON TERESE THERE'S NOT MUCH TO IT FORGET THE TRAIN STATION 
I WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED ON THE NINETEENTH OF AUGUST NINETEEN NINETY THREE NINETEEN NINETY THREE WHAT HAS THAT GOT TO DO WITH THIS 
I WANNA KNOW THE HISTORY BETWEEN YOU AND UNA DOYLE WHY 
BECAUSE UNA DOYLE HAS YOUR KIDS AND SHE DIDN'T TAKE THEM BECAUSE YOU'RE BEST FRIENDS 
SHE'S DRIVING ME INSANE 
LORE WE HAVE TO MEASURE HER LEVEL OF PROPENSITY TO KILL 
WE KNOW SHE'S A TRAINED KILLER BUT WHEN SHE KILLED IN THE PAST SHE WAS ACTING UNDER ORDERS 
YES THIS IS DIFFERENT 
THIS IS INTERPERSONAL 
WE HAVE TO KNOW THE DETAILS OF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU 
SO THAT WE CAN NEGOTIATE FOR THE RELEASE OF YOUR GIRLS 
IT'S COMPLICATED 
GO 
DONE 
DONE 
DONE 
WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE IS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
SIXTEENTH OF OCTOBER NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
YES SO YOU KNOW 
WELL I KNOW THAT YOU WERE ARRESTED CROSSING FROM FRANCE INTO SPAIN 
I KNOW THAT YOU WERE TRAVELLING WITH BRAHIM HADDOU 
I KNOW THAT THE DAY AFTER THAT ARREST UNA AND HER ACCOMPLICES WERE AMBUSHED IN GRANADA 
SEAN 
I KNOW THAT HER BROTHER WAS KILLED IN THAT SHOOT OUT 
I THINK THAT UNA SUSPECTS YOU OF INFORMING ON HER 
YES 
YES 
AND WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT WAS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU 
LORE WE KNOW YOU'RE A MEMBER OF E. T. A. I WAS NOT ANY MORE 
NO SO WHAT STOPPED YOU BELIEVING IN THE CAUSE 
I STILL BELIEVE IN OUR CAUSE 
I DON'T BELIEVE IN VIOLENCE 
WE'RE A LEGITIMATE RACE WE CAN HAVE OUR HOMELAND BY PEACEFUL MEANS 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT COMES RIGHT OUT OF A TEXTBOOK 
WELL MR. BOYD I'LL GIVE YOU THE NON TEXTBOOK ANSWER JUST FOR YOU 
I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO BOMB AND KILL INNOCENT CIVILIANS 
SO I CAN'T CUT IT AS A TERRORIST BOMBING 
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU DID WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID FOR THE CAUSE LORE 
YOU LAY ON YOUR BACK AND OPENED YOUR LEGS 
WELL MAYBE I GOT TIRED OF OPENING MY LEGS 
WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME YOU KNOW SHE'S JUST GOING TO SIT THERE 
LOOK AT HER 
WHILE HER KIDS ARE OUT THERE DYING OR 
SPENCE 
SIR CAN YOU BRING STEPHEN IN 
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE HIM TO SOMEONE HE HASN'T MET NOT A GOOD IDEA 
HE SHOULD KNOW WHO HE MARRIED DON'T DO THAT WHY NOT 
HE HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW HE MARRIED A TERRORIST AND A PROSTITUTE 
WHO'S SITTING TIGHT LIPPED WHILE HER KIDS DIE AT THE HANDS OF A DERANGED BITCH 
I MET UNA IN LIBYA O. K. 
GOOD WHEN 
NINETEEN NINETY ONE IN ONE OF QADDAFI'S TRAINING CAMPS 
HE LET THE I. R. A. TRAIN THERE 
BECAUSE E. T. A. AND THE I. R. A. HAD LINKS THAT'S RIGHT 
UM THEY INVITED US TO TRAIN IN THE CAMPS WITH THEM 
THE P. L. O. AND THE HEZBOLLAH WERE ALREADY THERE 
ALL WOMEN TRAINED TOGETHER ALONGSIDE QADDAFI'S GUARDS 
THEY TRAINED US BY TRYING TO BREAK US PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY 
THEY WERE TOUGH BUT UNA SHE 
SHE WAS TOUGHER THAN THEM ALL 
KNEEL 
KNEEL 
END IT 
SO BEING ONE OF QADDAFI'S GUARD 
DO YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN ON HIM OR WHAT 
I'LL KILL YOU 
ENOUGH YOU LOST 
IF I MAKE YOU KILL ME YOU DON'T GET ANY INFORMATION 
D'YOU THINK I OVERDID IT 
LIE STILL 
JUST BREATHE WE WON WE WON 
AH 
THEY COULDN'T BREAK HER DOWN 
SHE TOOK IT ALL NIGHT 
JUST TO BE STUBBORN 
YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE MANY NEGATIVE MEMORIES OF HER 
I LOVED HER LIKE A SISTER SO WHAT WENT WRONG 
I ASK YOU ONCE AGAIN LORE 
WHAT WAS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN YOU AND UNA DOYLE 
WE FORMED A CELL 
LET YOUR ENEMY HATE YOU 
LET HIS HATE FOR YOU BE A CANCER IN HIS SOUL 
BUT DON'T LET YOURSELF HAVE HATE IN YOUR HEART FOR YOUR ENEMY 
IT WILL DESTROY YOU 
WHEN YOU KILL DON'T KILL FOR REVENGE KILL FOR LOVE 
THE LOVE OF YOUR PEOPLE YOUR CAUSE YOUR COMRADES 
LET OUR BOND BE ONE OF LOVE 
AS SISTERS 
YOUR ENEMIES ARE MY ENEMIES YOUR HOPES ARE MY HOPES 
WE EACH WENT BACK TO WHERE WE CAME FROM BUT FROM TIME TO TIME 
IF ONE OF US NEEDED HELP THAT THE OTHER COULD GIVE WE WOULD GET IN TOUCH 
OCTOBER NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
UNA CONTACTED ME 
I WAS LIVING IN BAYONNE AND SHE NEEDED A CAR BROUGHT TO GRANADA 
AND I CONTACTED BRAHIM HOW DID YOU KNOW BRAHIM HADDOU 
HE USED TO DRIVE US 
WHEN WE ENTERED LIBYA WE CAME OVERLAND THROUGH ALGERIA TO AVOID DETECTION 
IF WE ARE STOPPED AND QUESTIONED KEEP YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND SIMPLE DON'T BE ELABORATE 
REMEMBER AFTER A WEEK WITHOUT SLEEP IT'S EASIER TO REMEMBER THE TRUTH THAN LIES 
SO FOR THIS TRIP THEN YOU THOUGHT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA I'LL CONTACT THIS BRAHIM HADDOU 
NO ACTUALLY HE ALREADY GOT IN TOUCH WITH ME 
I MEAN HE WAS BROKE AND NEEDED MONEY AND SO ON AND I ARRANGED IT FOR HIM 
O. K. SO THE JOURNEY WAS SIXTEENTH OF OCTOBER 
YES NINETEEN NINETY TWO YEAH TELL ME ABOUT IT 
WE GOT A CAR AND SET OFF TO GRANADA 
WE GOT ARRESTED AND RELEASED 
IT WAS ONLY WHEN WE LEARNT THAT UNA HAD BEEN AMBUSHED THAT WE REALISED OUR CELL HAD BEEN COMPROMISED 
BUT WHY DID SHE THINK THAT YOU INFORMED ON HER BRAHIM DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE WERE GOING 
I INSTRUCTED HIM AS WE WENT WAIT A MINUTE YOU GET A DRIVER HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS GOING 
IT'S PROCEDURE WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE CIRCLE OF TRUST UNA WOULD KNOW THAT 
ENGLAND SUMMER OF NINETY THREE 
AUGUST YOU CAME HERE WHY 
THE THIRD MEMBER OF OUR CELL WAS HERE AND NEEDED MY HELP 
THIS ONE 
OH MY GOD

WERE YOU WITH HER WHEN SHE DIED NO 
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED 
WHY DOES IT MATTER 
YOU KNOW WHY UNA IS TRYING TO KILL ME 
FATIMA HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS 
FATIMA'S COMPLETELY PART OF THIS HER DEATH IS WHY WE'RE HERE 
YOUR D. N. A. WAS AT HER MURDER SCENE SO YOU'RE HERE 
HER DEATH IS MY CASE AND CLOSING THE CASE IS MY PRIORITY 
SAVING YOUR CHILDREN I WOULD'VE THOUGHT WOULD BE YOUR PRIORITY LORE 
LORE WE KNOW YOU HAVE CLOSED THE DOOR ON YOUR PAST 
AND WE UNDERSTAND THE REASONS FOR THAT BUT WE HAVE TO KNOW 
IT'S VITAL 
O. K. UM 
WHEN I GOT HERE

THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS PROTECTING SHE'S LYING NO SHE'S NOT TELLING THE WHOLE TRUTH 
SHE'S LYING NO SHE'S PROTECTING THE TRUTH THE DIFFERENCE IS 
IT'S MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THAT BECAUSE IF YOU LIE 
YOU HAVE TO EXPAND ON THE DETAILS THERE'S MORE TO REMEMBER 
BUT IF YOU CONCEAL YOU MINIMISE THE DETAILS WHAT A LOAD OF AT SOME POINT IN HER PAST 
SHE'S BEEN TRAINED IN ANTI INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES 
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I'M A PIECE OF CAKE TO HER

WHEN QADDAFI STARTED BRINGING YOU PEOPLE IN AND OUT FROM MY COUNTRY AND THEY USED ME AS A DRIVER 
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS KEEP RECORDS 
I SOLD THEM THE INFORMATION 
WHAT THEY DID WITH IT I DON'T KNOW 
THEY PASSED IT ON TO OTHER SECURITY SERVICES INCLUDING M. I FIVE
