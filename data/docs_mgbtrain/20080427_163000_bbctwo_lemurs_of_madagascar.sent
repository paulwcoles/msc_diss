I'VE COME TO MADAGASCAR TO SPEND A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
FOLLOWING THE FORTUNES OF SOME VERY DETERMINED RING TAILED LEMURS 
MOTHERS WHO HAVE A REAL STRUGGLE ON THEIR HANDS KEEPING THEIR NEWBORN BABIES SAFE 
EVEN IN A GOOD YEAR HALF OF ALL NEW BABY LEMURS DIE 
BUT THIS SEASON THE FOREST THEY DEPEND ON HAS DRIED UP 
IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE WORST DROUGHTS IN YEARS 
SO THESE LITTLE BABIES ARE IN EVEN GREATER DANGER 
IN RING TAIL SOCIETY IT'S THE FEMALES WHO ARE IN CHARGE AND HAVE 
RESPONSIBILITY NOT JUST FOR THE BABIES BUT FOR THE WHOLE TROOP 
IN SUCH TROUBLED TIMES CAN THESE SUPER MUMS SAVE THE DAY 
THE LEMURS LIVE IN A PLACE CALLED CALLED BERENTY 
A NATURE RESERVE IN THE SOUTH OF MADAGASCAR 
IT'S A LITTLE PATCH OF FOREST ON THE BANKS OF A RIVER 
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY TRANQUIL THE SMALL SIZE OF THE LEMURS' HOME 
MAKES THEM EXTREMELY VULNERABLE IN SUCH A DRY YEAR 
AS SOON AS YOU STEP OUT OF THE FOREST YOU REALISE THAT WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH FOR THE LEMURS AND 
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR FOOD THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE FOR THEM TO GO 
OVER THERE YOU CAN SEE THE EDGE OF THE FOREST 
AND BEHIND THAT IS SISAL PLANTATIONS 
ON THIS SIDE THERE'S THE RIVER BANK 
AND EVEN OVER THERE YOU CAN JUST SEE THAT THERE'S JUST A TINY LITTLE STRIP OF FOREST 
AND BEYOND THAT IS FARMLAND 
THIS SMALL PATCH OF FOREST IS THE ENTIRE EXTENT OF THEIR WORLD 
THE WHOLE AREA IS PROBABLY NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN A SMALL FARM 
THE NEW MOTHERS ARE MAROONED ON WHAT IS NOW AN INLAND FOREST ISLAND 
AND THE FOOD IS RUNNING OUT 
APART FROM ALL BEING HUNGRY THE OTHER THING THE LEMURS HERE SHARE IS THE FACT THAT THEIR FAMILIES HAVE 
BEEN STUDIED BY SCIENTISTS FOR OVER FOUR DECADES 
THERE ARE ABOUT FORTY LEMUR TROOPS LIVING IN THE RESERVE 
AND ALTHOUGH THEY'RE VERY MUCH WILD ANIMALS THEY'RE REMARKABLY TAME HERE SHE COMES 
WHAT'S JUST SO WONDERFUL ABOUT THE LEMURS OF BERENTY IS THAT THEY'RE JUST SO RELAXED AROUND PEOPLE 
I MEAN I CAN GET THIS CLOSE YOU KNOW 
A METRE AWAY FROM HER AND HER BABY 
AND SHE'S NOT BOTHERED AT ALL 
AND IT MEANS YOU CAN GET A REALLY INTIMATE VIEW OF THEIR LIVES 
DURING MY STAY I'M GOING TO FOLLOW TWO MOTHERS 
BOTH WITH TINY INFANTS BUT LIVING VERY DIFFERENT LIVES 
THIS IS CUT TAIL AND HER BABY SON WHO'S ABOUT TWO WEEKS OLD 
CUT TAIL'S SORT OF MIDDLE AGED IN LEMUR TERMS SHE'S ABOUT EIGHT NOW 
AND SHE'S A REALLY EXPERIENCED MUM 
SHE'S HAD FIVE BABIES AND SHE'S ONLY LOST ONE WHICH IS VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE 
DESPITE HER EXPERIENCE THE ODDS ARE STACKED AGAINST HER BABY 
CUT TAIL'S POLITICAL CREDENTIALS AREN'T THAT GREAT 
WHICH AFFECTS HER SON'S CHANCES OF SURVIVAL 
IN LEMUR LAND IT'S ALL ABOUT GIRL POWER 
THE FEMALES ACTUALLY FORM QUITE A STRICT SOCIAL HIERARCHY 
AND CUT TAIL SHE'S KIND OF MIDDLE RANKING 
SO SHE'S WHAT YOU MIGHT REGARD AS A B. LISTER 
FOR RING TAILS IT'S NOT JUST WHAT FOOD YOU CAN FIND THAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE 
IT'S WHO LET'S YOU EAT IT THAT REALLY COUNTS 
AND AS CUT TAIL ISN'T TOP OF THE TROOP SHE MIGHT NOT GET ENOUGH FOOD TO MAKE MILK 
THE PROSPECTS LOOK MUCH BRIGHTER FOR THE OTHER MOTHER 
THIS FEMALE'S JUST GIVEN BIRTH 
I THINK PROBABLY JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO 
IT'S A TINY LITTLE THING 
I CAN'T SEE AN UMBILICAL CORD 
I DON'T KNOW WE MIGHT GET A VIEW OF IT LATER 
OH SORRY 
THERE YOU CAN SEE THE UMBILICAL CORD HANGING DOWN 
YOU CAN SEE IT'S REALLY HOLDING ON ALREADY THAT INSTINCTIVE REACTION 
TO BE ABLE TO CLASP ITS MOTHER'S HAIR 
RIGHT FROM THE MOMENT OF BIRTH 
THE NEW MOTHER'S NAME IS NAOMI 
THE REASON SHE'S CALLED NAOMI IS BECAUSE SHE IS ESPECIALLY PRETTY FOR A LEMUR 
AND VERY VERY SLIM SO SHE'S NAMED AFTER A SUPERMODEL 
AND IT'S INCREDIBLE EVEN AFTER GIVING BIRTH THAT SHE'S MAINTAINED HER FIGURE 
THIS IS SUCH A TOUGH TIME OF YEAR FOR HER TO GIVE BIRTH 
I MEAN IT'S REALLY LATE IN THE DRY SEASON 
BUT NAOMI'S SECOND RANKING IN THE TROOP SO 
SHE GETS PRIORITY ACCESS TO ALL THE BEST FOOD 
SO WITH ANY LUCK THIS BABY IS GOING TO BE JUST FINE 
I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW WHEN 
THERE IS A NEW BORN BABY IS IS IT A BOY OR IS IT A GIRL 
BUT I JUST CAN'T GET A PROPER LOOK AT THE MOMENT 
NO DOUBT WE'LL FIND OUT IN TIME 
BABY LEMURS ARE DELICATE AND NEED LOTS OF CARE IN ORDER TO THRIVE 
BUT CUT TAIL AND NAOMI COULDN'T BE RAISING BABIES AT A WORSE TIME 
THE FOREST THEY DEPEND ON HAS DRIED OUT 
THE FOREST IS JUST SO DRY 
IT'S RIGHT AT THE END OF THE DRY SEASON BUT THIS HAS BEEN AN EXCEPTIONALLY BAD YEAR 
I MEAN THESE ARE TAMARIND TREES WHICH NORMALLY WOULD BE COVERED IN PODS WHICH IS VITAL FOR THE 
LEMURS AT THIS TIME OF YEAR AND IT'S AN ABSOLUTE LIFESAVER FOR THEM 
AND THEY'RE COMPLETELY BARE IT'S LIKE AN ENGLISH WINTER 
THIS IS THE RESULT OF A CYCLONE EARLIER THIS YEAR 
THERE'S DEAD TREES AND DEAD BRANCHES EVERYWHERE 
AND THAT'S JUST COMPOUNDED THE PROBLEM 
ALL OVER HERE IS JUST DEAD TREE AFTER DEAD TREE 
THIS HAS REALLY AFFECTED THEIR FOREST VERY VERY BADLY 
BUT LIFE MUST GO ON FOR THE LEMURS 
AND CUT TAIL AND HER CROWD START A NEW DAY IN TYPICAL LEMUR FASHION 
IT'S JUST GONE FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
AND CUT TAIL AND HER TROOP ARE SLEEPING IN THESE TREES 
IT'S REALLY SWEET HOW THEY SLEEP IN THEIR LITTLE 
FAMILY GROUPS 
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO TELL WHO'S WHO IT'S LIKE WHERE ONE LEMUR STARTS AND THE OTHER 
ONE STOPS COS THEY ARE IN A BEAUTIFUL CUTE LITTLE HUDDLE 
I JUST LOVE THE WAY THEIR TAILS THEY MUST BE JUST LIKE THESE 
FANTASTIC SCARVES THAT THEY CAN WRAP ROUND THEM TO KEEP THEM WARM 
AT THE MOMENT IT'S ACTUALLY STILL QUITE COLD SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH IN THE TROPICS 
AND WHAT'LL HAPPEN AS SOON AS THE SUN HITS THE TOP OF THE TREES THEY'LL START TO STIR 
GOOD MORNING 
OOH STRETCH 
HERE'S A LEMUR WITH TWO BABIES 
SOMETIMES LEMURS DO HAVE TWINS BUT IN THIS CASE CUT TAILS ELDEST 
DAUGHTER'S DOING A SPOT OF BABY SITTING A GIVING HER MUM A WELL EARNED BREAK 
SHE'S JUST CHILLING OUT SHE'S SUCH AN EXPERIENCED MUM THAT 
WHENEVER SHE CAN TAKE A BIT OF TIME OUT SHE DOES 
YOU KNOW A BIT OF TIME TO HERSELF 
RING TAILS LOVE TO SUNBATHE IN THE EARLY MORNING 
A CHANCE TO KICK BACK AND CATCH A FEW RAYS GRADUALLY GETTING WARMED UP FOR THE DAY AHEAD 
BUT THEY CAN'T STAY BASKING FOR LONG 
WITH TINY MOUTHS TO FEED THERE'S SERIOUS WORK TO BE DONE 
SCOURING THE BARE FOREST FOR SOME BREAKFAST 
WHAT'S SO NICE ABOUT RING TAILS IS THAT THEY SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON THE GROUND 
MORE THAN ANY OTHER KIND OF LEMUR 
WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO GET SUCH A GOOD LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOUR 
AND ALL THEIR INTERACTIONS 
HERE SHE IS THE GIRL HERSELF CUT TAIL 
WHERE ARE YOU HEADED OFF TO 
I OFTEN FEEL I WISH I HAD A TAIL AS WELL IT'S NOT FAIR 
WITH ABOUT TWENTY INDIVIDUALS IN THE TROOP I COULDN'T IMAGINE HOW THEY WE ALL GONNA FILL THEIR BELLIES 
THERE SEEMED TO BE NOTHING BUT DEAD LEAVES 
BUT EVEN HERE THERE WERE A FEW MEAGRE PICKINGS FOR THE DETERMINED MUMS 
A LISTERS FIRST OF COURSE 
BUT I WAS HOPING CUT TAIL MIGHT GET A LOOK IN TOO 
OH YES 
THEY SEEM TO BE SEARCHING THROUGH THE LEAF LITTER I DON'T KNOW POSSIBLY FOR INSECTS 
LEMURS ARE OMNIVORES AND THEY'LL TAKE ANYTHING THEY CAN FIND ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME OF YEAR 
THAT WAS JUST A BIRD OF PREY GOING OVERHEAD 
YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY SEE HOW THEY SCARPER 
WELL SOME OF THEM 
ONE OF THE LADS DOESN'T SEEM BOTHERED AT ALL 
SURFING A CACTUS AND BRAVING SPINES FOR A JUICY LITTLE BITE TO EAT 
I'M SO GLAD TO SEE THAT CUT TAIL HAS FOUND SOME FRUIT 
EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED DAGUA FRUIT 
IT'S POISONOUS TO HUMANS BUT LEMURS SEEM TO BE ABLE COPE WITH IT 
IT MIGHT NOT BE THEIR FIRST CHOICE BUT AT THE MOMENT THEY CERTAINLY CAN'T BE CHOOSY 
THE MOTHERS DESPERATELY NEED FOOD TO MAKE MILK FOR THEIR BABIES AND CUT TAIL AND HER CROWD 
ARE CERTAINLY HAVING TO WORK HARD FOR EVERY BITE THEY FIND TO EAT 
THINGS LOOK QUITE A LOT BETTER FOR NAOMI'S BABY 
BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAS IT BEEN BORN INTO HIGH SOCIETY BUT NAOMI'S TROOP HAS CERTAIN ADVANTAGES 
THEIR RANGE INCLUDES THIS PLACE 
THE RESTAURANT IN THE TOURIST VILLAGE 
WHILE PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY FEED THE LEMURS 
THEY ALMOST ALWAYS MANAGE TO FIND A FEW CRUMBS LEFT OVER FROM BREAKFAST 
YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE THIS MAKES FOR THE LEMURS IN SUCH LEAN TIMES 
SOMETIMES THEY ARE JUST A BIT TOO CHEEKY FOR THEIR OWN GOOD 
AREN'T YOU HEY 
HERE'S NAOMI 
SHE'S ERM SHE'S FOUND 
HERSELF A GOOD MEAL OF BOUGAINVILLEA LEAVES THAT'S NOT SOMETHING SHE'D NORMALLY FIND IN THE FOREST 
LOOK AT THE BABY 
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S A BOY OR A GIRL 
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THE REST OF TROOP HAVEN'T YET COME OVER TO INVESTIGATE 
I THINK THEY KIND OF 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY ARE GIVING HER A BIT OF SPACE WITH HER NEW BABY 
BUT I'M SURE THAT AT SOME POINT THEY'LL WANT TO CHECK IT OUT 
NOW I'M GONNA TRY TO GET IN AND GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE BABY AND TELL WHETHER IT'S A BOY OR A GIRL 
SHE KEEPS MOVING 
IT'S REALLY VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO GET A PROPER LOOK AT IT 
I'M JUST DYING TO FIND OUT WHETHER IT'S A BOY OR A GIRL 
I'M KIND OF HOPING IT'S A GIRL BECAUSE GIRLS OVERALL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SURVIVAL THAN MALES 
IT'S A LITTLE BOY 
EVEN THOUGH NAOMI'S BABY IS A BOY HE STANDS A BETTER CHANCE OF SURVIVAL THAN MOST 
NAOMI'S FRIENDS HAVE NOW COME TO GREET HER 
SHE'S A POWERFUL LADY WHO GETS WHAT FOOD SHE WANTS 
BUT NOT ALL LEMURS ARE SO FORTUNATE 
WHILE NAOMI AND HER BABY RELAX ANOTHER MOTHER IN THE SAME TROOP IS NOT HAVING SUCH AN EASY TIME 
THIS IS POOR LITTLE ANNA 
SHE'S SUCH A SAD LITTLE THING 
SHE'S PART OF NAOMI'S TROOP BUT SHE IS ABSOLUTELY BOTTOM OF THE HEAP 
SHE LOOKS LIKE AN ANTIQUE TEDDY BEAR WHO'S BEEN THROUGH THE WASH 
A FEW TOO MANY TIMES AND THE TRUTH IS SHE'S CERTAINLY BEEN THROUGH THE WARS 
SHE'S ALWAYS BEING CHASED AWAY BY THE OTHER LEMURS AND HASN'T REALLY GOT ANY FRIENDS 
SHE'S RECENTLY JUST LOST HER BABY AND ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE JUST 
BY HERSELF 
SHE'S A VICTIM OF THE TOUGH HIERARCHY THAT IS LEMUR SOCIETY 
BACK IN THE FOREST CUT TAIL AND HER FAMILY ARE STILL MAKING THE MOST OF WHATEVER COMES THEIR WAY 
BUT THEY ARE STARTING TO SLOW DOWN 
IT HAS BEEN QUITE A TOUGH MORNING AND BY HIGH NOON IT IS UNBEARABLY HOT 
TIME TO HAUL UP IN THE SHADE AND REST 
AT THIS TIME OF YEAR IT'S JUST TOO HOT TO DO ANYTHING IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE DAY NO MATTER HOW HUNGRY YOU ARE 
LUCKY NAOMI AND HER GANG HAVE ALREADY STARTED THEIR SIESTA IN THEIR FAVOURITE CHILL OUT TREE 
WHEN IT'S HOT LIKE THIS THE ONLY SENSIBLE THING TO DO IS SNOOZE 
THIS LOT REALLY DO SEEM TO HAVE AN EASIER LIFE 
WELL MOST OF THEM 
OH IT'S SO SAD TO SEE ALL THE OTHER LEMURS ARE ALL CRASHED OUT HAVING A 
SIESTA TOGETHER AND POOR LITTLE ANNA IS JUST OUT ON HER OWN 
IT REALLY JUST BREAKS YOUR HEART 
WHILE THE LEMURS SLEPT I TOOK A WALK BEYOND THE FOREST 
THE RIVER WAS STILL JUST A TRICKLE 
AND THE SKY HELD NO PROMISE OF RAIN 
I KNEW SOME MOTHERS LIKE CUT TAIL WERE ON THEIR LAST RESERVES 
WITHOUT A NEW FLUSH OF LEAVES TO EAT SOON THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FEED THEIR BABIES 
COME DROUGHTS OR DOWNPOURS LEMUR MOTHERS HAVE TO KEEP SEARCHING 
AS THE AFTERNOON COOLED I PICKED UP NAOMI AND HER GANG OUT ON BORDER PATROL 
THEIR TERRITORY INCLUDES THE TOURIST VILLAGE AND THE SURROUNDING FOREST 
A TROOP WITH A LOT TO LOSE 
THEIR TERRITORIES AREN'T ACTUALLY THAT BIG 
THEIR WHOLE AREA IS PROBABLY ONLY THE SIZE OF A KIND OF SCHOOL YARD OR SOMETHING 
WHICH MEANS THAT THEY DO RUN INTO OTHER TROOPS QUITE REGULARLY 
AND AS THEY GO THEY REGULARLY SCENT MARK THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR TERRITORY 
THERE IS ACTUALLY QUITE A LOT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN LEMUR TERRITORIES SO IT ALWAYS WORTH JUST SAYING 
WE'VE BEEN HERE THIS IS OUR PATCH 
AND IN A YEAR WHEN EVERYONE IS SHORT OF FOOD TENSIONS ARE HIGH 
THEY'VE MET A RIVAL GANG AND YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE ALL KIND OF LINED UP CHECKING THEM OUT 
RIGHT IN AMONGST THE ACTION IS NAOMI WITH HER NEWBORN BABY 
I JUST ONLY HOPE THAT IF THINGS REALLY KICK OFF THEN THAT BABY IS GONNA BE ABLE TO HANG ON 
BEING SECOND IN COMMAND SHE JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO DROP BACK 
SHE'S GOT TO BE RIGHT IN THE THICK OF THE ACTION 
THE RIVAL TROOP ARE GATHERING OVER THERE 
THEY ARE HEADING THIS WAY HERE WE GO 
COME ON GIRLS SOLIDARITY 
THE RIVAL GANG ARE COMING IN 
CLOSER AND CLOSER 
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THEY OFTEN DO THEY HAVE THESE STANDOFFS 
IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY ARE SIZING EACH OTHER UP 
OUR GIRLS HAVE MOVED BACK A LITTLE BIT 
I DON'T LIKE TO THINK THEY HAVE RETREATED 
THE MALES ARE FURIOUSLY SCENT MARKING 
THE TERRITORIES OVER WHERE THE FEMALES HAVE SCENT MARKED 
THERE'S A FEMALE SCENT MARKING 
THAT'S SHOWING THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR TERRITORY 
THEY'RE SAYING WE OWN UP TO HERE 
AND THEN THE MALE YOU SEE HE'S GOT SCENT GLANDS IN HIS WRISTS HE'S GOT LITTLE SPURS 
THEN HE SCENT MARKS OVER THE TOP OF WHERE THE FEMALE HAS SCENT MARKED 
SMELL IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PART OF LEMUR SOCIETY 
THEY CAN TELL WHOSE IN THEIR GANG THEY CAN TELL WHO THEIR RELATIVES ARE 
THEY CAN TELL WHAT SORT OF SOCIAL STATUS THEY'VE GOT AND OF COURSE THEY USE IT TO MARK THEIR BOUNDARY 
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE OUR GANG ARE BACKING OFF NOW WHICH 
I HAVE TO SAY I AM PRETTY RELIEVED ABOUT 
I KNEW NAOMI WOULD BE RIGHT IN THE FOREFRONT OF ALL THE ACTION AND 
WITH A NEWBORN BABY THAT'S JUST TOO DANGEROUS 
SO PERHAPS IT'S A GOOD THING 
IT ISN'T JUST NASTY NEIGHBOURS WHO ARE GIVING THE MOTHER LEMURS A HARD TIME 
THIS TIME THERE'S TINY TROUBLE COMING FROM WITHIN THEIR OWN RANKS 
DESPITE THEIR DIFFICULTIES CUT TAILS' TROOP ARE TURNING OUT TO BE GREAT MUMS 
THEIR LITTLE WELL BEHAVED INFANTS ARE TURNING INTO ROMPER STOMPER GREMLINS 
JUST A BIT TRYING ON THE FOREST FLOOR 
BUT TODDLERS AND TREETOPS AREN'T A GOOD COMBINATION 
WHEN THEY CLIMB REALLY HIGH CUT TAIL'S BABY GAVE ME SOME NAIL BITING MOMENTS 
OH BABY PLEASE HANG ON TIGHT 
I MEAN IF HE FALLS FROM UP THERE THERE'S JUST NO WAY HE'D SURVIVE 
THAT'S SIXTY FEET UP 
OH BABY DON'T 
BABY'S WANDERING OFF AGAIN 
IN GENERAL THE MALE BABIES ARE MORE ADVENTUROUS 
THAT ACTUALLY CAN BE A BIT OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE 
MANY MANY LEMUR BABIES DIE JUST FROM HAVING A FALL FROM A GREAT HEIGHT LIKE THAT 
I MEAN HE JUST REMAINS IN CONTACT BUT HE'S WANDERING OFF 
HE'S TRYING TO SCRAMBLE ACROSS ONTO THAT BRANCH 
HE LOOKS VERY UNSTEADY 
OH OH LOOK HE'S OFF 
AND SHE'S JUST 
I MEAN IT'S EXTRAORDINARY I WOULD HAVE REALLY THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE JUST REACHED OUT AND RETRIEVED HIM 
GOOD THAT IS FAR AS HE'S GONNA GO 
AFTER MAKING SURE THEY ALL GOT SAFELY BACK DOWN TO THE GROUND I TOOK A BREAK TO WRITE SOME NOTES 
AND FELL UNDER THE SPELL OF SOME UNEXPECTED MADAGASCAN MAGIC 
LIGHT FOOTED DANCERS APPEARED LIKE FOREST SPRITES 
SIFAKAS COUSINS OF THE RING TAILS 
THEY DANCED ALL AROUND ME UNTIL SUNSET 
ISN'T THAT JUST WONDERFUL 
AND THEN THEY WERE GONE 
NEXT MORNING NAOMI'S GANG INVITE THEMSELVES TO BREAKFAST 
AND WHILE ALL THE OTHERS TUCK INTO A HEARTY MEAL ANNA IS HAVING TO SCROUNGE SCRAPS FROM THE BIN 
WELL AT LEAST NOBODY SHOOS HER OFF RUBBISH 
WATCHING HER I NOTICED THAT SHE HAD LOST EVEN MORE FUR 
AND IT WASN'T JUST DOWN TO HER JUNK FOOD DIET OR STRESS 
SOMETHING ELSE WAS AFFECTING HER 
LEUCAENA TREES ARE AN INTRODUCED TREE FROM SOUTH AMERICA 
AND AT FIRST GLANCE MIGHT LOOK LIKE A LIFE SAVER FOR A HUNGRY LEMUR 
EVEN DURING A DROUGHT EACH TREE KEEPS SOME GREEN LEAVES 
BUT THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM WITH IT THEY'VE ACTUALLY DISCOVERED THAT IT'S POISONOUS AND IT'S THE REASON 
WHY A LOT OF THE LEMURS LIKE ANNA ARE LOOSING ALL THEIR HAIR 
IT'S ACTUALLY GOT A CHEMICAL IN IT THAT ACTS LIKE CHEMOTHERAPY 
NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHY SOME LIKE ANNA LOOK SO AWFUL AND OTHERS LIKE NAOMI LOOK JUST FINE 
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT AT SOME LEVEL IT'S AFFECTING ALL OF THEM BECAUSE 
NAOMI'S TROOP HAVE HAD FAR FEWER BABIES THAN THEY'D NORMALLY HAVE 
SO WE ARE DOUBLY LUCKY TO HAVE NAOMI'S LITTLE BABY 
ALTHOUGH THEY CAN'T ALL COPE WITH LEUCAENA TREES 
NAOMI'S CLAN DO KNOW HOW TO FIND SOME NATURAL REMEDIES FOR THE OTHER THINGS THEY HAVE TO EAT 
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING WHAT THEY ARE DOING HERE 
THEY ARE LICKING THE BARK OF THIS TREE WHICH IS LIKE A MINERAL SUPPLEMENT 
AND THEY GET A DOUBLE DOSE OF GOODNESS BECAUSE UNDER HERE 
IS TERMITE CLAY WHERE THE TERMITES HAVE BEEN EATING THIS DEAD TREE 
AND BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN EATING SO MANY LEAVES AT THIS TIME OF YEAR 
WHICH CONTAIN A LOT OF POISONOUS TANNINS THIS TERMITE CLAY ACTUALLY ACTS AS A KIND OF DETOX SYSTEM 
POISONOUS PLANTS AREN'T THE ONLY THREAT IN THE FOREST 
THERE ARE OTHERS LURKING ABOUT WHICH AREN'T QUITE SO EASY TO DEAL WITH 
HUNGRY ANIMALS WHO MIGHT LIKE TO PUT BABY LEMUR ON THE MENU 
WOW THEY ARE REALLY PSYCHED UP 
SOMETHING HAS UPSET THEM 
WHAT IS GOING ON YOU LOT 
THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND THAT IS REALLY UPSETTING THEM 
IT'S A BOA LOOK AT THAT 
IT'S FANTASTIC 
GOSH WE ARE LUCKY 
NO WONDER THE LEMURS WERE SO FREAKED OUT THAT COULD CERTAINLY KILL CUT TAILS' BABY 
OH WOW 
I DON'T WANT TO PUT MY HANDS IN TOO FAR BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT VENOMOUS IT CAN STILL BITE 
THERE THERE I THINK WE'RE GETTING A BETTER VIEW 
LOOK IN HERE LOOK 
YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT WAS A BIT FOOLHARDY OF ME JUST TO CHARGE IN THERE 
BUT THERE AREN'T ANY POISONOUS SNAKES IN MADAGASCAR SO I KNEW I WAS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT 
WHAT A RESULT 
THEY ARE STILL FREAKED OUT UP THERE 
WOW BEAUTIFUL 
IT KILLS IT'S PREY BY CONSTRICTION SO IT LITERALLY JUST COILS ITSELF 
AROUND AND SUFFOCATES ITS VICTIM AND THEN DISLOCATES ITS JAW AND SWALLOWS IT WHOLE 
NOT A VERY NICE END FOR A BABY LEMUR 
THE GREATEST THREAT FOR BOTH CUT TAILS AND NAOMI'S BABIES 
IS NOT FROM SNAKES IT'S FROM OTHER RINGTAIL LEMURS 
ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR WHEN THE FOREST IS SO DRY AND NONE OF THEIR FAVOURITE TAMARIND TREES BORE FRUIT 
THE LACK OF FOOD CAN LEAD TO STANDOFFS AND FIGHTS AND CUT TAIL'S ARCH ENEMIES 
ARE A LARGE AND SCRUFFY MOB THAT LIVE NEXT DOOR THE RAG TAG TROOP 
THEY'VE MET THE RAG TAG TROOP RIGHT ON THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TERRITORY AND THERE WAS A BIT OF A SCRAP 
THERE'S CUT TAIL PHEW SHE'S STILL GOT HER BABY 
BUT THAT I THINK THOSE OVER THERE ARE THE RAG TAG TROOP 
THEY'VE JUST CHASED CUT TAIL AND HER LOT 
BUT CUT TAIL ISN'T GONNA BACK DOWN COMPLETELY 
THE EDGE OF HER TERRITORY HAS TO BE PROTECTED 
YOU CAN SEE THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE'S BASICALLY A 
BIT OF SKIRMISH A BIT OF RUNNING AROUND AND THEN THEY ALL STAND AGAIN AND TAKE STOCK OF WHO'S WHERE 
OH OH OH WOW 
IT'S REALLY KICKING OFF THERE 
IT'S JUST AMAZING IS THE WAY THESE REALLY GENTLE MOTHERS CAN 
SUDDENLY TURN INTO FIERCESOME WARRIORS JUST LIKE THAT 
NOW YOU SEE EVERYTHING HAS JUST SETTLED DOWN AGAIN NOW 
OUR LOT ARE KIND OF BACKING OFF 
THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY MADE THEIR POINT 
AND OVER THERE RAG TAG TROOP ARE ALSO BEGINNING TO HEAD OFF IN THAT DIRECTION 
SO I THINK THE DISPUTE'S OVER 
UNTIL THE NEXT TIME OF COURSE 
MEANWHILE NAOMI AND ANNA'S TROOP ARE HAVING SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THEIR NEIGHBOURS 
AND WITH A PRIME TERRITORY THE STAKES ARE HIGHER 
THE BABIES HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO INTO BATTLE WITH THEIR MUMS AND JUST HAVE TO HANG ON FOR DEAR LIFE 
IF THEY FALL THEY COULD BE KILLED 
THE FEMALES ARE DOMINANT AND HAVE TO LEAD THE FIGHT 
WHILE THE MALES FRANTICALLY WIPE THEIR TAILS WITH SCENT HARDLY THE MOST FIERCESOME BATTLE TACTIC 
BUT THIS IS CLASSIC LEMUR STINK FIGHTING 
ALTHOUGH NAOMI AND CUT TAILS TROOPS PROVED 
GOOD AT SEEING OFF THE COMPETITION I KNEW BOTH THE MOTHERS AND THEIR BABIES WERE STILL IN DANGER 
BERENTY WAS JUST AS DRY AS WHEN I'D FIRST ARRIVED A FORTNIGHT EARLIER 
BUT A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER JUST BEFORE IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO LEAVE 
SOMETHING MIRACULOUS STARTED TO HAPPEN ALL AROUND ME 
THE DROUGHT STRICKEN BERENTY FOREST SUDDENLY CAME TO LIFE 
PERHAPS THE TREES COULD SENSE THAT RAIN WAS ON ITS WAY OR THE WATER TABLE HAD RISEN 
NO ONE COULD BE SURE BUT ALL THROUGH THE FOREST 
PLANTS AND TREES BURST INTO BLOOM AND UNFURLED THEIR LEAVES 
AND BEST OF ALL THE TAMARIND TREES THEMSELVES FINALLY WOKE UP 
ALTHOUGH THEY HAD FAILED THE NURSING MOTHERS BY NOT PRODUCING FRUIT 
THE GREAT TREES UNFURLED THEIR NEW LEAF BUDS SHOCKING PINK AT FIRST AND THEN BEAUTIFUL EMERALD GREEN 
THANKS TO THEM THE FOREST IS NOW A JUICY LEMUR BANQUET 
PLENTY OF FOOD FOR CUT TAIL AND HER FAMILY AT LAST 
WOW WHAT A DIFFERENCE SINCE I FIRST ARRIVED THEY ARE NOW JUST IN LEMUR HEAVEN 
AND WHAT OF ANNA AND NAOMI 
ANNA SEEMED TO HAVE AT LEAST FOUND ONE FRIEND WHEN THE TIME CAME TO SAY GOODBYE 
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HER GETTING INTO TROUBLE 
AND AS FOR NAOMI AND HER SON THINGS JUST COULDN'T BE BETTER 
NAOMI'S BABY IS SUCH A CUTIE HE'S REALLY DEVELOPING INTO QUITE A CHARACTER 
HE'S STARTING TO GROOM HIS MUM NOW 
HE'S JUST GOT EVERY ADVANTAGE IN LIFE AND I'M SURE HE'S GOT A REALLY BRIGHT FUTURE 
WITH MORE THAN ENOUGH FOOD FOR EVERYONE NOW THERE'S LESS NEED TO FIGHT 
PERHAPS THEY CAN ALL AFFORD TO RELAX AND TAKE IT EASY 
I LEFT THE LEMURS KNOWING THE BABIES WERE IN GOOD SHAPE 
NOT ONLY HAD THEIR FOREST COME TO THE RESCUE BUT THEIR MOTHERS WERE SUCH REMARKABLE ANIMALS 
DETERMINED GENTLE AND BRAVE 
REAL SUPER MUMS AFTER ALL 
ONLY YO OU 
CAN MAKE THIS WORLD SEEM BRIGHT 
WE GOT COMPANY 
ONLY YOU 
SOME THINGS GET BETTER WITH AGE 
THE INDIANA JONES TRILOGY BEGINS
