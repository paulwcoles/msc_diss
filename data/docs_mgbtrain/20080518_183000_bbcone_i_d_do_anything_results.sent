SAM IN WAY LOOKED TOO COMFORTABLE 
SHE'S A STRONG PRESENCE AND THAT 
CHARACTER IS A VERY WEAK CHARACTER

MOVES WELL LOOKS FANTASTIC AND 
SINGS WELL 
JODIE JODIE I KEPT HOPING THEY WERE REALLY

ALL FIVE NANCYS PERFORM TOGETHER AS 
A GROUP NEXT WEEK WE WILL BE DOWN 
TO FOUR 
THE SING OFF IS COMING UP YOUR 
VOTES HAVE ALREADY DECIDED WHO IS 
IN THE BOTTOM TWO BUT WHO DO OUR 
NANCYS THINK DESERVES TO BE THE 
NEXT TO LOSE HER LOCKET 
THE PERSON 
I THINK ISN'T NANCY BASED ON THIS 
WEEK'S PERFORMANCE IS JESSIE I 
THINK HER PERFORMANCE LACKED DEPTH 
NIAMH IS NOT MY NANCY HUGELY 
SUCCESSFUL POP CAREER BUT NOT 
NANCY IN MY EYES 
THE PERSONAL I 
DON'T THINK IS NANCY IS NIAMH IT 
WASN'T THE RIGHT SONG TO SHOW HER 
NANCY TRAIT 
I THINK SAMANTHA IS 
NOT NANCY SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE 
DOESN'T FOR ME CAPTURE THE TRUE 
ESSENCE THE TRUE NANCY 
I WOULD SAY 
RACHEL ISN'T NANCY BECAUSE I FEEL 
LIKE HER PERFORMANCE LACKED WARMTH 
LIKE HER PERFORMANCE LACKED WARMTH SO THAT'S WHAT OUR NANCYS THINK 
BEFORE WE ANNOUNCE THE RESULT 
LET'S ASK THE PANEL BASED ON THIS 
WEEK'S PERFORMANCE WHO THEY THINK 
IS NOT NANCY 
JOHN 
BECAUSE OF HER INCONSISTENCY JOHN IN PERFORMANCES JESSIE 
I ADORE 
HER BUT I DO THINK SHE'S TOO YOUNG 
AND MORE SUITED TO THE ROLE OF BET 
NANCY'S BEST FRIEND I WILL SAY 
NIAMH 
SADLY I AGREE SHE'S NIAMH ENCHANTING BUT NIAMH IS NOT NANCY 
THANKS TO THE VIEWERS VOTES THERE
