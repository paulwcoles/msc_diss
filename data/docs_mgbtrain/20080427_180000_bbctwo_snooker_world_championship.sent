HELLO AGAIN FROM SHEFFIELD THERE 
IS A BUZZ IN AND AROUND THE 
CRUCIBLE THAT IS ALWAYS THE CASE 
WHEN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS ON THE 
ORDER OF 
PLAY WE 
ALL WEEK 
INTO THE 
TOURNAMENT AND THE TARGET FOR 
RONNIE AND HIS SECOND ROUND 
OPPONENT 
MARK WILLIAMS 
IS 
STILL TO 
BE STANDING NEXT SUNDAY THAT WOULD 
MEAN THEY WERE IN THE FINAL OF THIS 
THEY 
DID TAKE 
COM WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP BETWEEN 
THEM THEY 
HAVE ALREADY 
DONE THAT ON FIVE 
OCCASIONS THEY HAVE BOTH WON THE 
TITLE TWICE CURRENTLY THEY ARE 
PLAYING FOR 
A 
PLACE IN 
THE QUARTER 
FINALS 
AND THE 
STANDARD 
OF SNOOKER 
THEY HAVE 
SERVED UP 
SO FAR HAS BEEN 
TOP CLASS 
IT WAS YESTERDAY EVENING THAT 
RONNIE AND MARK'S SECOND ROUND 
CLASH BROKE OFF A TIGHT OPENING 
FRAME WENT RONNIE'S WAY ON THE 
BLACK MARK BOUNCED BACK IN THE 
SECOND FRAME TO LEVEL THE SCORES A 
VERY TIGHT THIRD FRAME WAS SETTLED 
WHEN RONNIE BUILT IN THIS LONG 
DOUBLE ON THE PINK TO SNATCH BACK 
THE ADVANTAGE RONNIE ROLLED IN 
THIS PINK BUT MARK FOUGHT BACK TO 
LEVEL THE MATCH AT TWO TO TWO AT THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL RONNIE WAS 
SUPERCHARGED AFTER THE BREAK HE 
HIT A ONE HUNDRED FORTY CLEARANCE HIGHEST BREAK 
OF THE TOURNAMENT 
SO FAR 
AND EIGHTY ONE 
GAVE RONNIE THE SIXTH AFTER A POOR 
SHOT FROM MARK A FRAME WINNING SIXTY ONE 
GAVE O'SULLIVAN THE SEVENTH 
FIVE TO TWO DOWN MARK NEEDED THE FINAL 
FRAME OF THE SESSION TO STAY IN 
TOUCH HIT THE SUPERB BREAK OF EIGHTY EIGHT 
TO SIGNAL THE END OF AN ABSORBING 
EVENING OF CRUCIBLE SNOOKER 
THE ATMOSPHERE IS ABSOLUTELY 
ELECTRIC HERE THIS EVENING IT 
ALWAYS IS WHEN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS 
AROUND WILLIE I DID THAT MATCH 
YESTERDAY AND RONNIE WON FIVE TO THREE BUT 
IT COULD QUITE EASILY HAVE BEEN FIVE 
THE THE OTHER WAY 
YES THING 
MARCUS HAD THE FEW CHANCES THE KEY 
FOR MARK IS THAT RONNIE'S LONG POT 
SUCCESS RATE HAS NOT BEEN AS GOOD 
AS IT CAN BE BUT I THINK RONNIE IS 
VERY VERY CLOSE TO GETTING BACK TO 
GREAT FORM A ONE HUNDRED FORTY BREAK EARLIER IN 
THE MATCH 
AND OF COURSE THE TABLES 
HAVE BEEN RECOVERED L. WAS 
COMMENTATING THIS AFTERNOON THEY 
LOOKED TO BE PLAYING BEAUTIFULLY SO 
NO EXCUSES FOR THE PLAYERS THIS 
EVENING L. THINK THE CLOTH IS A 
LITTLE SLOWER 
I'M SURE THE TABLES 
WILL SPEED UP AS WE GO ALONG I'M I'M SURE THE PLAYERS CAN'T 
WAIT TO 
GET 
OUT THERE TO INTRODUCE THEM I 
WILL HAND YOU OVER TO OUR M. C. ROB 
THE TALKER WALKER 
THANKS VERY MUCH DENNIS TAYLOR 
WHAT A CHAMPION FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE GOOD 
EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AS 
YOU CAN TELL THE CRUCIBLE IS 
CRACKLING WITH ANTICIPATION FOR THE 
MATCHES WE HAVE GOT TONIGHT 
WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ADO LET'S GET 
THE BOYS ON THE BAIZE INTRODUCING 
FIRST OF ALL A MAN RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN SAID COULD RULE THE GAME 
FOR TEN YEARS SEMI FINALIST HERE 
LAST YEAR HE WON THE CHINA OPEN 
LAST MONTH HE IS THE PRIDE OF 
SCOTLAND STEPHEN ON FIRE MAGUIRE 
AND HIS OPPONENT THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WELSH 
OPEN CHAMPION A QUARTER FINALIST 
HERE TWO YEARS AGO HE 
TRADITIONALLY LOVES THE BIG 
OCCASION HE IS THE MELBOURNE 
MACHINE NEIL ROBERTSON 
ON TABLE NUMBER ONE HOLD YOUR 
BREATH FOR THIS ONE PLEASE WELCOME 
A PLAYER OF UNQUESTIONABLE PEDIGREE 
A WINNER OF SIXTEEN RANKING EVENTS 
TWICE A U. K. CHAMPION TWICE A WINNER 
HERE HE IS THE WELSH POTTING 
MACHINE MARK J. WILLIAMS 
AND FINALLY A PLAYER OF OUTRAGEOUS 
NATURAL TALENTS AN ABSOLUTE 
MAGICIAN WITH A CUE IN HIS HANDS 
HE IS THE DOUBLE WORLD CHAMPION 
COME PINK AND YOU HAVE MISSED HIM 
THE ROCKET RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
BLINK AND YOU HAVE MISSED HIM 
IN THE COMMENTARY BOX FOR RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN VERSUS MARK WILLIAMS IT 
IS JOHN VIRGO AND CLIVE EVERTON 
JOE TIGHT TWO TWICE WERE CHAMPIONS 
IN ACTION BUT AS EVER THE PRIMARY 
FOCUS ON RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HOW 
WILL HE PLAY WHAT WILL HE DO WILL 
HE PLAY BRILLIANTLY WHERE HE SELF 
DESTRUCT OR WILL IT SIMPLY BE A 
SESSION OF HIGH QUALITY 
CHAMPIONSHIP SNOOKER WELL HE 
SELF DESTRUCT WILL HE SELF 
DESTRUCT 
MUCH TOO THICK ON THE BREAK OFF SO 
AN EARLY CHANCE FOR MARK WILLIAMS 
STARTED OFF THIS MATCH BREAKING OFF 
LEFT HANDED BUT THE SECOND TIME HE 
BROKE OFF HE HIT IT MUCH TOO THICK 
LIKE THAT HE CHANGED TO THE RIGHT 
HAND BUT NO BETTER 
SO THAT POOR BREAK OFF SHOT FROM 
O'SULLIVAN HAS GIVEN WILLIAMS THE 
CHANCE TO MAKE THE GOOD START THAT 
HE NEEDS RESUMING TWO BEHIND 
YES WILLIE THORNE JUST BEFORE SAID 
HE THOUGHT MARK WILLIAMS HAD TO WIN 
THIS SESSION TO STAY IN THE MATCH 
I THINK HE HAS TO WIN IT OR 
EVEN IN THE EIGHT FRAMES THAT ARE 
PLAYED TONIGHT BECAUSE WHEN YOU 
GET TO THAT FINAL SESSION AND IT IS 
CLOSE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN 
NOT THE BEST JUDGED CANNON HE HAS 
EVER PLAYED INTENDED A FULL BALL 
CONTACT OFF SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT ON 
THE RED WHICH WAS IN LINE BETWEEN 
PINK AND BLACK HAD THE CANNON 
WORKED OUT PERFECTLY HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO RETAIN BLACK BALL 
POSITION 
MARVELLOUS POT THAT WAS A TERRIFIC 
POT NOW HAS HE GOT THE ANGLE TO 
STUN UP AND STUN INTO THE CLUSTER 
HE SHOULD STILL BE ON THE LOOSE RED 
TO THE RIGHT CORNER 
WELL AS IT HAPPENED AFTER 
WILLIAMS KEPT THE BREAK GOING WITH 
THAT EXCELLENT RED THE CUE BALL 
CAME OFF THE BUNCH IN SUCH A WAY 
THAT HE HAS LEFT THE RED TO THE 
LEFT CORNER 
YES HE PLAYED IT WITH 
SCREW L. THOUGHT HE MIGHT STUN UP 
BUT WE SAW HOW DIFFICULT THAT RED 
WAS HE POTTED IN THE MIDDLE THAT 
WAS SPOT ON JUST THE START HE WAS 
LOOKING FOR PLAYING THE POTS 
RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE POCKET 
JUST GONE A BIT AWKWARD HE STUNNED 
UP TO THEM BUT GOT A BIT OF 
BACKSPIN INSTEAD OF THE CUE BALL 
MOVING THROUGH THE REDS IT JUST 
CAME BACK A LITTLE BIT THERE MAY 
BE A POSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD PLAY 
A RED TO THE RIGHT CENTRE THAT IS 
THE ONLY POSSIBLE POT 
ACUTE ANGLE 
AND IF HE ATTEMPTS IT HE WANTS TO 
BE SURE THAT HE DOESN'T LEAVE 
ANOTHER RED IN CASE HE MISSES IT 
YES THING THAT IS WHY HE IS 
THINKING ABOUT IT CLIVE IT IS 
FRAUGHT WITH DANGER IT IS NOT 
ACTUALLY AS DIFFICULT AS THE RED HE 
POTTED A FEW MOMENTS AGO BUT THAT 
ONE I COULDN'T LEAVE ANYTHING IF 
HE MISSES THIS HE COULD IS IT 
WORTH THE RISK THAT IS WHAT HE IS 
THINKING EXCELLENT 
AND CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT AN 
EASY RED HAD HE MISSED IT WILLIAMS 
FIVE TO THREE DOWN BUT HE HAS POTTED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO 
BALLS TO O'SULLIVAN'S ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN 
BUT SOME BALLS OF COURSE ARE MORE 
IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS 
SLIGHTLY HAMPERED SO COULDN'T GET 
AS GOOD ON THIS BLACK AS HE WOULD 
HAVE LIKED 
MARK IS A FLOATER ISN'T HE HE 
LIKES FLOATING BALLS IN THE POCKET 
IF YOU CAN PLAY THAT WAY IT GIVES 
THE BALL A LITTLE BIT MORE 
OPPORTUNITY TO DROP ALTHOUGH AT 
THE MOMENT NO NEED FOR THAT 
EVERYTHING IN THE HEART OF THE 
POCKET 
THERE IS NO OTHER TOP POCKET PLAYER MORE AT EASE ROLLING THE 
BALL DIDN'T GET THE CANNON QUITE 
RIGHT THERE FULL BALL ON THE 
SECOND RED WOULD HAVE LEFT STRAIGHT 
INTO MIDDLE 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST TOO CRUEL 
AT THAT ANGLE 
HE'S LOOKING FOR TWO MORE REDS WITH 
COLOURS THIS IS THE NATURE OF TOP 
LEVEL SNOOKER AS MARK JUST GETS 
READY TO APPROACH THE TABLE 
SUPPOSED TO BE AN ADVANTAGE TO HAVE 
BREAK OFF BUT IN ALL FAIRNESS 
HE HIT IT BADLY YOU WOULD BE 
SURPRISED NOW IF HE GETS ANOTHER 
SHOT WHILE THE FRAME HIS LIFE 
COLOUR ONE MORE RED AND A COLOUR 
NEEDED WHILE THE FRAME IS ALIVE 
HE HAS LET THE CUE BALL SLIPPED TO 
LOW 
YES SO NOW HE IS SIXTY FOUR POINTS IN LOW FRONT BUT THERE ARE STILL SIXTY SEVEN LEFT 
ON THE TABLE AND THE COLOUR IS NOW 
NOT A FORMALITY HE HAS LET THAT 
SLIP 
I AM SURE THAT WHEN WILLIAMS WAS ON 
THE RED HE JUST THOUGHT WELL HE 
WOULD TAKE RED BLACK A COUPLE 
MORE REDS HERE 
HE IS GIVING IT 
PLENTY OF THOUGHT MARK PINK IS 
FRAME BALL PINK TO THE RIGHT 
MIDDLE NOT PLAYING FOR A RED JUST 
PLAY THE POT 
THAT IS ANDY FORDHAM AND THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
WORLD DARTS CHAMPION HE IS ONLY 
HALF THE MAN HE WAS RICHER THE 
WITH ALL THE WAY THAT HE HAS LOST 
WITH ALL THE WEIGHT THAT HE HAS 
LOST 
WELL HE WAS MORE OR LESS LOST FORCED INTO THAT HE COULD NOT SEE 
A SAFETY MAYBE HE WAS TRYING TO 
GET 
THE CUE 
BALL A 
BIT CLOSER 
TO 
THE 
TOP CUSHION 
L. THINK HE KNOWS 
THAT THE 
FRAME 
HAS GONE 
A CHOICE 
OF REDS TO THE RIGHT MIDDLE YOU 
WOULD NOT EXPECT MARK WILLIAMS TO 
MISS THIS THE RED IS ALL HEANEY 
HEANEY DOES 
WELL THAT IS ALL 
HEANEY DOES L. THOUGHT THAT WAS A 
BIT OF A TWITCH THAT IS THE ONLY 
ONE HE NEEDS 
IT JUST SHOWS YOU 
FRAME BALL CAN CATCH ANYBODY OUT 
THERE IS A POSSIBLE SIXTY SEVEN LEFT ON THE 
TABLE AS MARK PONDERS WHAT HAPPENED 
THERE HE REALLY NEEDS TO BE PINK 
OR BLACK OFF THIS RED THIS IS NOT 
GOING TO BE GOOD L. DON'T THINK SO 
IT IS RUNNING TOO FAR WHEREAS THE 
CUE BALL GOING IT IS CLOSE TO THE 
POCKET WHERE IS THE CUE BALL 
GOING IT DID NOT GOING AND HE HAS 
A CHANCE FOR POTTING THE PINK 
CUE BALL ONCE AGAIN CLOSE TO THE 
POCKET RONNIE WAS JUST MESSING 
ABOUT L. THINK HE WOULD HAVE 
KNOCKED THE CUE BALL OFF THE TABLE 
AND CONCEDED IF IT WENT IN HE CAN 
ONLY AFFORD ONE MORE PINK 
THE REST WILL HAVE TO BE BLACK AND AND THAT HE DECIDED WAS NOT THE TIME 
TO RISK DIFFICULT CUT BACK WITH 
NO CERTAINTY OF THE NECESSARY PINK 
OR BLACK BALL POSITION 
YES BUT HE 
WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE 
SAFETY HE DID NOT FIND THE BAULK 
CUSHION ONLY THE BAULK LINE 
ANOTHER CHANCE AT FRAME BALL FOR 
MARK 
WILLIAMS HAS POTTED SEVENTY TWO PER CENT OF MARK LONG BALLS THAT HE HAS ATTEMPTED 
THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE IT 
WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HIM BACK TO ONLY 
FIVE TO FOUR BEHIND THAT IS BORING SNOOKERS 
YES HE PURPOSELY PLAYED A STUN RUN 
THERE THAT IS BARRING SNOOKERS 
RONNIE CAN'T KEEP LEAVING HIM A 
CHANCE OF FRAME BALL THERE IS A 
GOOD SAFETY HERE IF HE CAN GET ONE 
THAT IS A BETTER ONE A GOOD LENGTH 
WITH THE CUE BALL THIS TIME A 
LITTLE TAP ON THE TABLE FROM MARK 
WELL WILLIAMS IS EXASPERATED WITH 
HIS FAILURE AT THE LONG POT WHICH 
WOULD HAVE GUARANTEED HIM THE FRAME 
IF HE CAN GET PAST THE GREEN HE 
CAN CUT THIS ONE INTO THE LEFT 
MIDDLE IN IT GOES THAT IS THE 
FRAME BALL 
TO LEAVE O'SULLIVAN NEEDING TWO 
SNOOKERS O'SULLIVAN STAYS IN HIS 
CHAIR AND WILLIAMS HAS REDUCED AND 
SEVEN'S LEAD TO FIVE TO FOUR 
I THINK EVERYONE IS LOOKING TO 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS HE HAS 
REDUCED O'SULLIVAN'S LEE HOW DO 
THING THE TABLE IS PLAYING 
I THINK 
THE TABLES LOOKED TO BE PLAYING 
SUPERBLY WELL THERE IS NO EXCUSE 
THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE PLAYING OFF 
THE CUSHIONS THAT PAVED THE WAY TO 
GIVE HIM THE FIRST FRAME 
WHICH WAS 
VERY IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO TAKE I I WAS DISTURBED THE WAY THAT MARK 
NEEDED A COUPLE OF CHANCES TO GET 
FRAME BALL HE VERY RARELY MISSES 
FRAME BALL L. L. THINK HE GOT A BIT 
ANXIOUS KNOWING HE WAS RIGHT INTO 
THE MATCH AT FIVE TO FOUR IT WAS A BIG GAME 
FOR HIM 
MARK HAS BEEN SHOWING 
SIGNS OF RECOVERY HE HAD A 
DIFFICULT SEASON LAST SEASON BUT 
HE HAS TO GO TO THE SEMI FINALS TO 
STAY IN THE TOP SIXTEEN HE IS NOT GOING 
TO STAY DOWN THERE FOREVER HE IS A 
CLASS ACT 
UNDOUBTEDLY I THINK HE 
NEEDS TO GET TO THE SEMI FINALS 
DOESN'T HE 
YES HE WAS PROVISIONAL 
FORTY SECOND UNTIL RECENTLY IT IS GREAT TO 
SEE HIM PLAYING WELL AGAIN 
WELL WILLIAMS'S RANKING WENT INTO 
FREEFALL AFTER HIS LAST RANKING 
SUCCESS WHICH WAS THE TWO THOUSAND SIX CHINA 
OPEN THAT WAS IN APRIL OF THAT 
YEAR 
HE HARDLY WON A MATCH FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
DEFINITE SIGNS RECENTLY OF A 
RESURGENCE 
THE MATCH IS BEING PLAYED AT A 
BRISK PACE O'SULLIVAN AVERAGING SEVENTEEN 
SECONDS PER SHOT WILLIAMS NINETEEN 
WELL MAYBE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS A 
CHANCE OF THE SECOND BALL PLANT IN 
THE THIRD IN BUT HE DID NOT EXPECT 
TO 
GET THE 
BREAK UNDER WAY LIKE 
THAT 
NO AND HE DID PUT HIS HAND THAT UP AND APOLOGISE TO MARK BUT HIS 
MAIN INTENTION WAS TO PLANT TO 
CLEAR THE RED AWAY FROM THE 
POCKET IT WAS A BONUS IT GOING IN 
HE MAY BE JUST ABOUT ON THIS BROWN 
IT IS A THIN ONE BUT HE MIGHT JUST 
BE ABLE TO POT IT 
JUST ASCERTAINING WHETHER THE BLACK 
GOES TO RIGHT CORNER 
WELL THAT WAS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF 
FORGETTING ABOUT THE POT AND JUST 
TRYING TO CONCENTRATE ON WHERE HE 
WANTED THE CUE BALL IN RELATIONSHIP 
TO POSITION ON THE BLACK CARELESS 
IF HE CONSIDERS THAT HE IS TO 
HAMPERED FOR THE BLACK THE PINK IS 
AVAILABLE HE IS TO HAMPERED 
YES I AGREE WITH YOU THE PINK 
LOOKS ON MAYBE IT IS JUST THE 
WRONG ANGLE HE IS NOT GUARANTEED 
POSITION ON THE RED BUT THE PINK 
LOOKS THE BETTER OPTION 
HE PLAYED IT NICELY THERE'S A PINK 
SPOT AVAILABLE THERE IS NO OTHER 
SPOTS AVAILABLE IT IS GOING AS 
CLOSE AS IT CAN TO ITS OWN SPOT IN 
A DIORITE DIRECT LINE WITH THE 
MIDDLE OF THE TOP CUSHION WITHOUT 
TOUCHING ANOTHER BALL IT DOESN'T 
AFFECT MARK WILLIAMS IN THE LEAST 
AS HE GIVES US THE OLD SLIDING OF 
HIS HAND ALONG THE CUSHION 
A LITTLE SHAKE OF THE HEAD HE JUST 
WANTED TO BE OFF STRAIGHT ON THIS 
BLACK SO HE COULD PLAY FOR THE RED 
THAT IS TO THE RIGHT OF THE BLACK 
HE WAS JUST THE WRONG SIDE OF 
STRAIGHT AS FOREIGNERS HE WAS 
CONCERNED IT JUST MEANT THAT HE 
HAD TO LET THE CUE BALL TRAVEL A 
LITTLE BIT FURTHER THE FURTHER THE 
CUE BALL TRAVELS THE MORE THINGS 
THAT CAN GO WRONG 
HE HAS NOT LEFT THE BEST ANGLE ON 
HIS INTENDED RED 
THIS RED IS 
TRICKY NOW HE HAS A BIT TO DO WITH 
THE CUE BALL TO GET ON A BAULK 
COLOUR 
WELL HE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED THERE 
BUT AS SOON AS HE SLID OUT OF 
POSITION ON THE BLACK HE WAS 
ALWAYS CHASING TO GET THAT CUE BACK TO WHERE 
HE WANTED 
IT AND HE 
NEVER DID THAT WAS A GOOD CHANCE 
MORE THAN SIX FEET OF TABLE 
INVOLVED SAID THAT COUNTS AS A 
LONG POT FOR O'SULLIVAN HIS 
PERCENTAGE IN THAT DEPARTMENT WAS 
AS DOWN AS LOW AS EIGHT AT ONE 
TIME IT IS STILL MODEST TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT YOU 
IS ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT MARK 
WILLIAMS IS UP TO SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT WHICH IS 
ACCEPTABLE HE NEEDS ANOTHER GOOD 
POT HERE THOUGH JIMMY COME EVERY 
TIME HE MISSES THESE LONG POTS HE 
IS JUST HITTING THEM TOO THICK IT 
SEEMS EVERYONE HE HAS MISSED HAS 
JUST BEEN TOO THICK EVERY SHOT 
HE HAS MISSED 
IT MUST BE LOVELY FOR WILLIAMS 
AFTER HIS LONG SPELL IN THE 
DOLDRUMS TO BE IN CONTENTION AGAIN 
IN A BIG MATCH HE IS PLAYING IN 
THE GREATEST SNOOKER VENUE IN THE 
WORLD 
YES AND THIS WILL TEST OUT WORLD YOUR NERVE HE PLAYED WELL IN THE 
FIRST SESSION HE STARTED THIS I 
MEAN O. K. THE FIRST FRAME HE 
NEEDED A COUPLE OF TRIES AT POTTING 
FRAME BALL BUT APART FROM THAT HE 
HAS LOOKED VERY COMPOSED 
WELL I DON'T THINK HE PLAYED TO 
CANNON THE RED L. THINK HE WAS TRY AND SCREW ROUND THE 
BACK OF IT L. THINK 
HE JUST 
WANTED 
TO MISS THE RED AND COME ROUND 
BACK FOR THE RED AS THE SAME POCKET 
AS THE BLACK 
FOUR THE SAME POCKET HE WANTED TO POT IT IN THE SAME POCKET 
HE IS TAKING IT ON IN IT GOES 
WHERE IS THE CUE BALL GOING WHERE 
IS IT GOING WELL IT DIDN'T GO IN 
THE POCKET BUT I CANNOT SEE AN 
EASY POT ON A COLOUR BUT IT WAS A 
VITAL RED HE IS NOW FORTY FIVE POINTS IN 
FRONT STILL A POSSIBLE FIFTY NINE LEFT ON 
THE TABLE 
TIME TO CLOSE IT UP 
MAYBE GREEN UNDER THE 
JUST PASSED THE MIDDLE POCKET 
POSSIBLY 
WELL THAT WAS THE INTENTION BUT 
THE GREEN IS NOT UNDER THE CUSHION 
NO HE COULD HAVE MADE A BETTER JOB 
THAN THAT BUT HE WAS CONCERNED 
ABOUT LEAVING THIS RED UP IN THE 
BAULK END AND THINK HE COULD PLAY 
A GOOD SAFETY I THINK HERE IS THE PLAYER'S VIEW 
A GOOD SHOT IN THE END 
RONNIE HAS 
GOT TO BE LITTLE BIT CAREFUL WHEN 
HE IS PLAYING THIS RED THERE WAS 
ALWAYS DANGER HE WAS GOING TO 
KNOCK A RED TO THE RIGHT CORNER 
THAT IS 
WHAT HE 
HAS 
DONE AND 
THE 
BROWN IS 
NOT COMING 
TO HIS RESCUE 
THAT IS MISTAKE RED BLACK WOULD BE SUFFICIENT 
HE HAS MISSED FRAME BALL IN THE 
SECOND FRAME OF THE EVENING JUST 
AS HE DID IT TWICE IN THE FIRST 
FRAME JUST AS HE DID TWICE IT 
WASN'T BECAUSE OF ANY POSITIONAL 
HEROICS HE JUST PLAYED TO POT THE 
BLACK 
ABSOLUTELY THERE IS A BLACK LITTLE CHINK IN THE ARMOUR THERE 
I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN SEE ENOUGH 
OF THIS RED TO POT THE BLACK NOT A 
BAD SHOT BUT HE HAS NOT FOUND A 
BAULK CUSHION THAT JUST TAKES A 
LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE OFF THE SHOT 
FOR MARK BUT HE WILL HAVE IT IN 
HIS MIND THAT HE HAS MISSED FRAME 
BALL AGAIN IT CAN GNAW AWAY AT 
YOUR CONFIDENCE 
HE JUST 
CONCENTRATED ON ROLLING THE BLACK 
IN BUT OVER CUT IT 
I THINK HE HAD HALF A MIND THAT 
THAT RED MIGHT GO IN THE POCKET 
BUT CATCHING THE BLUE THIS RED HE 
IS ON THE BLACK WILL FOLLOW IF HE 
CAN POT IT THAT IS O. K. 
HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE TOO STRAIGHT 
ON THIS BLACK IF HE IS OF HE WILL 
HAVE PROBLEM GETTING ON THE NEXT 
RED OF COURSE HE IS FORTY FIVE POINTS 
BEHIND HE CANNOT AFFORD TO CHANCE 
PINCHING BIT OF THE POCKET ON THE 
BLACK SO HE IS PLAYING FOR 
POSITION FOR US TO PLAYING FOR 
POSITION HE HAD TO MISS THE GREEN 
HE HAS DONE THAT IS A LOVELY SHOT 
WHAT A THING TO HAVE IN YOUR 
ARMOURY THE FACT THAT YOU CAN PUT 
OUR HANN YOU CAN PLAY WITH 
EITHER HAND 
MARK WILLIAMS MAY EVEN LIVE TO 
REGRET THAT MISSED BLACK THAT HE 
THREE POINTS IN IT HE HAS TO GET 
OFF THIS LAST RED THERE ARE 
THREE POINTS IN IT NOW THE 
PROBLEMS START THE BLUE IS ON THE 
SIDE CUSHION 
I DON'T THINK RONNIE WAS INTERESTED 
HE MAY HAVE THOUGHT I MIGHT BE 
LUCKY AND JUST CATCH THE GREEN 
QUARTER BALL BUT THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THING IS TO GET ON THE 
YELLOW THIS IS POTABLE HE CAN PUT 
THE CUE BALL IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
A LITTLE BIT FULLER THAN IDEAL YES YES IT IS GOING INTO WHAT WE CALL A 
BLIND POCKET A DELICATE ONE 
BURDITT IS THERE AND NOW IT IS ALL 
ABOUT BROWN TO BLUE AND HE LOOKS 
INCH PERFECT TO ME ON THE BROWN 
IT IS THERE HE WOULD LOVE TO 
HAVE BEEN STRAIGHT ON THIS BLUE 
THE MORE PACE HE PUTS ON IT THE 
HARDER OF THE POT IS THE HARDER 
THE POT IS 
HE CUED IT LIKE A DREAM 
FOR A START IT IS ALL ABOUT TIMING 
WHAT A FRAME TO PINCH THIS WOULD 
BE WILLIAMS MISSED FRAME BALL 
O'SULLIVAN MADE A VERY FINE FORTY EIGHT 
CLEARANCE TO SNATCH THE FRAME ON 
THE BLACK TO GO TWO IN FRONT AGAIN 
IT APPEARS AS THOUGH MARK WILLIAMS 
THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT AND 
THEN THOUGHT YES I AM GOING TO 
TRY AND COMPOSE MYSELF 
I DON'T 
BLAME HIM FOR TRYING TO LEAVE THE 
ROOM HE HAD HIS FRAME HIS HAND IS 
ON THE CUSHION HERE BUT IT IS A 
COMFORTABLE BLACK THAT IS 
VIRTUALLY GAME BALL THAT WILL HURT 
WHAT ARE YOUR OBSERVATIONS OF 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
A COUPLE OF 
THINGS HOW WELL HE GETS THROUGH 
THE BALLS WITHOUT HITTING THEM HARD 
YELLOW TO GREEN HE GOT THE 
POSITION PERFECT BUT THEN BROWN TO 
BLUE AND THEN THE BLUE MOST 
PLAYERS WOULD HAVE FOUND IT HARD TO 
SCREW BACK RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS 
BLESSED WITH SUCH A WONDERFUL CUE 
ACTION IT WAS PERFECT 
THERE IS A 
LOT OF SNOOKER TO BE 
PLAYED IN 
THIS 
MATCH OF COURSE BUT BOTH THESE 
PLAYERS SOMETIMES GLYDE IT LOOKS 
INCREDIBLY EASY COMFORTABLE IT 
FLOWS THEY GLIDE 
HE IS A 
FLOATER HE JUST FLOATS IT INTO THE 
POCKET THAT IS A BIG FRAME IT IS 
A LONG WAY TO GO 
BUT IT 
COULD 
BE A 
BIG TURNING POINT IN THIS MATCH 
RONNIE HAS NOT SETTLED QUITE YET 
BECAUSE HE HAS NOT LOCKED IN A LONG 
POT KNOCKED IN HE IS STILL TWO 
FRAMES AHEAD WITHOUT KNOCKING THE 
LONG ONES IN MARK CANNOT AFFORD TO 
KEEP MISSING 
I THINK MARK WILLIAMS 
WILLIE HE IS SO LAID BACK AND HE 
IS ALWAYS MAKING JOKES AND USUALLY 
YOU OR MYSELF OR ANYONE WHO IS ON 
THE END OF THEM BUT HE IS FIERCELY 
COMPETITIVE 
IT IS THE BEAUTY OF COMPETITIVE MARK WILLIAMS HE HAS SUCH A 
WONDERFUL TEMPERAMENT YOU WOULD 
NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WAS WINNING OR 
LOSING THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE 
HAD A CHANCE TO WIN THE FRAME BUT 
HE PROBABLY KICK THE DOOR ON THE 
WAY OUT 
THE WINNER OF THIS MATCH 
WOULD SURELY FEEL THAT IT IS SUCH A 
CONFIDENCE BOOST THEY COULD THINK 
THIS COULD BE MY YEAR FOSTER 
ABSOLUTELY 
RONNIE WOULD WANT TO ABSOLUTELY WIN A THIRD WORLD TITLE THIS 
COULD BE MY YEAR 
THERE MIGHT BE A FEW DENTS IN 
WALL OR A DOOR AT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 
THE ARENA AND THE DRESSING ROOM 
MARK WILLIAMS IS BACK 
O'SULLIVAN SWITCH BACK TO LEFT 
HANDED BREAK OFF SHOT SWITCHED 
THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG ABOUT ONE 
HE CERTAINLY DID NOT PLAYING A POT 
HE HIT THE SAFETY SHOT TOO TIGHT 
LUCKILY IN THE END HE DID NOT GO 
IN OFF NOT THE EASIEST SAFETY SHOT 
FOR RONNIE THIS RED NEAR THE BAULK 
OFF IT BUT IT IS NOT THAT 
STRAIGHTFORWARD HE HAS TO BE 
CAREFUL HE DOES THAT KISS BAULK COLOUR 
OR EVEN 
DOUBLE KISS THE CUE 
BALL HE DOESN'T KNOCK KISS 
WANTED TO SNOOKER WILLIAMS ON THE 
RED IN BAULK NOT HAVING DONE SO 
IT IS THE EASIEST THING IN THE 
WORLD FOR WILLIAMS TO LEAVE THE CUE 
BALL ON THE BAULK CUSHION 
WANTED A BETTER CANNON ON THE 
SECOND RED TO RETAIN BLACK BALL 
POSITION 
YES HE DID A LITTLE POSITION KNOCK ON THE TABLE FROM RONNIE IT 
WAS A TOUGH POT PLAYING THE BROWN 
WHEN YOU ARE IN A SITUATION LIKE 
THAT YOU HAVE TO TELL THE REFEREE 
FOUL AND MISS THE THE REASON IT IS CALLED A MISS IN HIS 
OPINION THE REFEREE WILL BE 
THINKING IT IS EASIER TO HIT THE 
BLACK BUT WHO WOULD WANT TO TRY 
AND HIT THE BLACK AND LEAVE HIM 
AMONGST THE REDS ANYWAY HE HAS 
HAD ONE GO IF HE HITS THE BROWN 
YOU WOULDN'T THINK HE WOULD LEAVE 
ANYTHING 
THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT SAFETY SHOT 
FROM RONNIE O'SULLIVAN BUT THAT 
WAS EVEN BETTER FROM MARK GOOD 
LINE GOOD LENGTH 
AND IT WAS SUCH A GOOD SAFETY FROM 
WILLIAMS SUCH GOOD LENGTH THAT IT 
HAS FORCED O'SULLIVAN INTO A 
MISTAKE 
WELL CERTAINLY INTENDED TO BE 
PLAYING BLUE NEXT SURELY HE IS ON 
THE PINK NO HE IS RIGHT ON TO THE 
EDGE OF THE RED 
THE ONLY COLOUR HE 
CAN HIT IS THE BROWN IT IS 
UNBELIEVABLE ISN'T IT GOOD CHANCE 
HE WILL BE ANNOYED WITH THAT 
THAT WAS NICE THROUGH THAT GAP 
THIS WAS THE WILLIAMS MISTAKE SUCH 
AN EASY FIRST RED HE LEFT HIMSELF 
AN ABLE TO POT EITHER BLUE OR PINK 
A BIG MISTAKE 
YES ON THE FACE OF 
IT YOU COULD SAY IT WAS A BAD SHOT 
I SUPPOSE IF HE HAD 
PLAYED FOR 
BLUE AND 
HE WASN'T 
ON IT THAT WAS 
FAIR COMMENT 
YOU 
THINK HE 
WOULD BE 
ENTITLED 
TO BE 
ON THE YELLOW AT 
LEAST SO A LITTLE BIT UNLUCKY 
RATHER THAN ALL HIS OWN FAULT I 
FEEL 
IT IS INTRIGUING WHEN YOU GET TWO 
PLAYERS WHO PLAY HIGH QUALITY 
SAFETY LIKE MARK AND RONNIE HE CAN 
POT THIS RED ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE 
OF THE TABLE ACCORDING TO HAWK EYE 
CLOSE I ASSUME HE PLAYED IT 
THINKING THAT THE ONLY RED HE COULD 
LEAVE WAS THE ONE HE WAS PLAYING 
OTHERWISE I DON'T THINK HE WOULD 
HAVE PLAYED THE POT ON THAT RED HE 
HAS NOT LEFT THE ONE HE PLAYED SO 
I SEE B. T. SAFE I ASSUME IT IS 
SAFE 
BUT ANY MISTAKE NOW FROM EITHER 
PLAYER COULD BE VERY COSTLY THE 
REDS ARE NICELY SPREAD PINK IS IN 
THE OPEN BLUE IS ON ITS SPOT 
IF EITHER PLAYER HAD GOT IN YOU 
WOULD BE EXPECTING THEM TO SCORE SIXTY 
OR SEVENTY 
TRADE MARK WILLIAMS LONG POT THAT THAT WAS A TERRIFIC POT AND THAT CHANCE 
NOW FALLS TO MARK 
HE COULD BE PERFECT HERE HE IS ON 
THIS RED AND DEFEATIST PLAYS A 
LITTLE CANNON ON THE 
RED THAT 
IMMEDIATELY TO 
THE LEFT 
OF THE 
BLACK HE 
WILL 
HAVE THE 
BLACK FOR 
THE SAME POCKET PLAYED IT 
PERFECTLY WHAT A CHANCE THIS IS 
NOW 
APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER FROM THE 
OTHER SIDE IT IS ALWAYS OFF 
PUTTING NO LAUGHED ON THIS ONE 
BUT THEY YOU GO JUST THE SCREEN IN 
BETWEEN THE TWO NOW A BIG CHEER 
AND A BIG ROAR MARK WILLIAMS HAS 
GOT TO KEEP HIS CONCENTRATION HERE 
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT 
OPPORTUNITY IN A VERY IMPORTANT 
FRAME 
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE NOISE 
EMANATING FROM THE OTHER TABLE YOU 
REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS YOU WOULD 
GIVE SOMEONE BLACK LOOKS IF THEY 
COUGHED 
AT LEICESTER SQUARE HALL COUGHED THE GREAT HOME OF THE GAME JUST 
AFTER THE WAR ONLY TWO HUNDRED SEATS AND 
THE SLIGHTEST NOISE WAS FROWNED 
UPON BUT THIS IS THE MODERN GAME 
YOU HAVE TO CATER FOR A FAR LARGER 
NUMBER OF SPECTATORS THAN IN THE 
OLD DAYS AND THE TWO TABLES HERE 
ARE MUCH CLOSER TOGETHER THAN IN 
THE OTHER ARENAS 
HE IS NICELY ON THE RED BUT HE IS A 
LITTLE BIT ANNOYED THAT HE IS 
HAMPERED BY THE RED TO THE LEFT OF 
THE CUE BALL HE COPED WITH IT 
NICELY 
AFTER THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF LOSING 
THE LAST FRAME WHEN HE WAS 
EFFECTIVELY WITHIN A BALL OF 
LEVELLING AT FIVE TO FIVE WILLIAMS 
DISAPPOINTED AS HE WAS GAVE 
HIMSELF A GOOD THREE OF FOUR 
MINUTES OUT OF THE ARENA TO COMPOSE 
HIMSELF AND PERHAPS WE ARE SEEING 
THE VALUE OF THAT HERE 
YES WE WERE SAYING HOW IMPORTANT 
THAT SAFETY EXCHANGE WAS THE ONE 
WHO POTTED THE GOOD LONG BALL COULD 
GET ENOUGH TO WIN THE FRAME AND 
THAT HAS GONE IN THE FAVOUR OF MARK 
WILLIAMS TERRIFIC OPENING RED 
NOT INTERESTED IN A CENTURY 
DELIBERATELY WENT OUT OF POSITION 
KNOWING THAT O'SULLIVAN WOULD 
CONCEDE SO WILLIAMS HAS REDUCED 
O'SULLIVAN'S LEAD TO SIX TO FIVE 
NOW WILLIAMS IS ONE OF THE 
RENOWNED JOE CLOSE OF THE CIRCUIT 
ALWAYS UP TO SOME MISCHIEF OR PRANK 
AND HE'S ALSO A PRETTY GOOD 
IMPERSONATOR OF A PLAYER'S STYLE 
LAST EVENING HE THOUGHT HE WOULD 
GIVE HIS VERSION OF JOE SWAIL WHEN 
THE LAST FRAME OF THE DAY WAS 
ALREADY WON 
YES YOU SEE THE BACK 
AND AND THE WAY JOE SWAIL PUTS HIS 
ARM UP THIS IS HOW LAID BACK HE IS 
IN A 
MATCH 
OF THIS 
IMPORTANCE AND 
HE THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY MONIQUE 
AND THERE IS JOE SWAIL ALL RIGHT 
HE WAS LEFT HANDED AND JOE IS RIGHT 
HANDED BUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 
INTERVAL OF THE FIRST FOUR FRAMES 
STEPHEN HENDRY BET HIM FIFTY THAT HE 
WOULDN'T DO IT AND OF COURSE HE 
DID IT AND STEPHEN HAD TO COUGH UP 
WITH FIFTY IT WAS A FIFTY SCOTTISH 
NOTE BY THE WAY MARK GREAT FULLY 
RECEIVED IT AS I SAY EVEN IN THE 
HEAT OF BATTLE THIS MAN HAS STILL 
GOT TIME TO HAVE A JOKE FOUL AND A MISS HE MISSED THE THIN EDGE 
SO THAT IS WHY WILLIAMS DIDN'T HAVE 
THE BALL PUT BACK 
YES IT WAS A 
GOOD POT HE JUST CAUGHT THE JAW OF 
THE MIDDLE POCKET AND THAT IS WHY 
IT WENT 
UP PAST 
THE BAULK LINE 
STILL A CHANCE FOR THE SCREEN 
THOUGH A NATURAL ANGLE TO COME 
BACK DOWN THE TABLE 
IF HE 
COULD 
GET IN A NICE POSITION OH NO 
THERE WERE REDS AVAILABLE L. 
THOUGHT HE MAY HAVE PLAYED IT IN 
THE LEFT MIDDLE AND COME DOWN THE 
RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE I'M 
SURPRISED HE PLAYED IT IN THAT 
POCKET JUST OFF 
SO O'SULLIVAN AT THE TABLE 
BECAUSE OF MISS BY WILLIAMS ONE 
POCKET WHEN JOHN VIRGO AND I BOTH 
THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT GREEN 
TO ANOTHER POCKET 
WELL NOT ABSOLUTELY INCH PERFECT 
HERE HE HAS GOT THIS RED TO THE 
RIGHT CORNER BUT HE IS GOING TO 
HAVE TO BE GOING THROUGH ALL THE 
REDS FOR POSITION HE NEEDED THAT RED TO DROP 
I THINK HE'S O. K. ON THIS BLUE NOW NOW TO GO BACK TO WILLIAMS'S DEBATABLE 
SHOT CHOICE THAT IS WHAT WE 
THOUGHT HE MIGHT PLAY BUT MAYBE IT 
WASN'T QUITE ON THAT WAS PROBABLY 
WHY HE TRIED TO PLAY THE GREEN TO 
THE LEFT CORNER 
YES IT WAS HIS 
DECISION BUT THAT WAS AN 
ALTERNATIVE THAT LOOKED THE BEST 
ALTERNATIVE TO ME CLIVE BUT 
OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU ARE PLAYER DOWN 
THERE YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE 
DECISIONS AND HE OBVIOUSLY THOUGHT 
THE GREEN IN THE TOP POCKET WAS 
EASIER AND MAYBE FROM HIS POINT OF 
VIEW HE COULD SEE THE GREEN AND THE 
POCKET WHEREAS IF HE HAD BEEN 
PLAYING IT IN THE LEFT MIDDLE HE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING INTO 
A BLIND 
POCKET THIS IS 
THE ONE 
HE PLAYED 
IN THE END BUT THAT MISSED GREEN 
LOOKS TO HAVE COST HIM THIS FRAME 
NOW RONNIE HAS PLAYED A LITTLE 
CANNON AND IT HAS WORKED OUT 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT HE HAD A NICE 
LITTLE RUN OF THE BALL HERE RONNIE 
WHEN HE POTTED THE RED CANNONED 
INTO ANOTHER ONE SO IN EFFECT HE 
POTTED TWO REDS AT THE SAME TIME 
IF THAT ONE AND STAYED 
IN THE 
THE BLACK WOULD HAVE BEEN ON SO 
JUST LOOKING FOR RED COLOUR RED 
RED COLOUR RED NOW 
BEEN A VERY INTERESTING MATCH SO 
FAR CLIVE AS WE HAVE ALREADY 
COMMENTED AS RONNIE GETS DOWN 
THERE JUST A RED AND A COLOUR 
RONNIE'S LONG POTTING NOT UP TO 
SCRATCH AND PROBABLY HIS SAFETY 
BUT WHEN HE GETS IN AMONGST THE 
BALLS DOES LOOK LIKE SCORING 
HEAVILY DOESN'T HE 
I THINK IT IS 
THE LAST ASPECT OF HIS GAME TO GO 
HE HAS ONLY POTTED ONE IN THREE OF 
HIS LONG POT ATTEMPTS BUT 
INVARIABLY HE SCORED HEAVILY AT 
CLOSE QUARTERS SIXTY ONE ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHTY ONE 
AMONGST HIS EFFORTS IN ADDITION TO 
THIS ONE 
LET'S SEE HOW HE GETS ON THE YELLOW 
DRIVING IT ROUND THAT IS WHAT WE 
CALL LOVELY CUE ACTION JUST 
EFFORTLESS THE WAY HE PUSHES THE 
CUE THROUGH THE CUE BALL WE SHOULD 
SEE ASIAN WE SHOULD SEE A CENTURY 
IT WOULD BE HIS FIVE HUNDRED NINETEENTH IN 
COMPETITION STILL TWO HUNDRED BEHIND 
STEPHEN HENDRY BUT IT IS STILL AN 
AWFUL LOT 
SO WITH THAT BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED TWO RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN LEADS MARK WILLIAMS BY 
SEVEN TO FIVE AT THE MID SESSION INTERVAL 
IT IS GREAT STUFF THERE ARE MORE 
CENTURIES THAN USUAL WOULD YOU 
AGREE 
YES I THINK IT HAS BEEN AGREE BEST PART OF THIRTY L. AM SURPRISED 
RONNIE HAS NOT MAKE BIGGER BREAKS 
TODAY AFTER HIS HIGH SCORING 
YESTERDAY 
BUT IT IS REMINDING ME YESTERDAY OF THESE PLAYERS FIVE OR SIX YEARS 
AGO WHEN THEY WERE TWO OF THE TOP 
FOUR REMEMBER EVERY TOURNAMENT 
THERE WERE THE BIG FOUR THAT IS 
THE WAY THE A PLANE IT IS NICE TO 
SEE MARK WILLIAMS BACK AGAIN BUT 
THE THING WITH RONNIE 
HAVING THE 
FIVE 
THREE LEAD YOU 
ALWAYS THINK 
AS LONG AS 
I KEEP SHARING MANY SESSIONS OF 
FOUR I'M GOING TO WIN BUT THAT IS 
EASIER SAID THAN DONE BUT IT IS 
NICE TO SEE MARK PLAYING WELL WHAT WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE 
WAY BOTH 
PLAYERS HAVE PLAYED THIS EVENING I I THINK MARK WILL BE DISAPPOINTED HE 
MISSED TWO OF THREE GAME BALLS AND 
THEN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN DID THE 
MAGNIFICENT CLEARANCE TO PINCH IT 
MARK WILLIAMS WILL BE DISAPPOINTED 
HE HASN'T WON THAT SESSION AND 
LEVELLED 
DENNIS DOES MARK LEVELLED WILLIAMS NOW HAVE TO JUST HOPE THAT 
RONNIE HAS ONE OF 
THE SESSIONS 
THE SWITCH GOES THE OTHER WAY OF A 
SUDDEN 
I DON'T THINK HE WILL WORRY SUDDEN TOO MUCH ABOUT ROONEY'S GAME HE 
WILL BE WORRYING ABOUT HIS GAME AND 
WILL WANT TO WIN THE FRAME IN ONE 
VISIT 
ONE IS CAPABLE OF RUNNING VISIT AWAY WITH THINGS 
I DON'T THINK HE 
HAS SHOWN ANY FORMER TOUR IN THIS 
TOURNAMENT L. WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH 
HIM IN THE FIRST ROUND BUT HE HAS 
SHOWED SIGNS OF 
FORM IN 
THIS MATCH 
TO 
BEAT MARK 
WILLIAMS HE WILL HAVE 
TO PLAY WELL 
THIS IS THE SITUATION 
INTO THE SECOND ROUND MATCHES THEY 
GOT UNDER WAY TODAY 
THEIR SECOND SESSION IS TOMORROW 
MORNING AND THE FINAL SESSION 
TOMORROW NIGHT 
THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN LIANG DID 
NOT KNOW THE SCORE HIS INCREDIBLE 
FOOD PASSED HIM BY IN FRAME FIVE 
THE YOUNG MAN FROM CHINA JOE SWAIL 
THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY LIANG BACK TO 
HIS SEAT OH HAVE I POTTED A RED 
OH HAVE GOT TO GO AND PLAY AGAIN 
I THINK HIS FAN CLUB IS INCREASING 
DENNIS 
HE IS A GREAT CHARACTER HE DENNIS HAS ENDEARED HIMSELF TO THE CROWD 
JOE SWAIL IS A LOVELY FELLOW HE 
REALLY ENJOYED THAT THE REFEREE 
WAS ENJOYING IT THAT IS THE FIRST 
TIME I HAVE SEEN THAT HAPPEN WHERE 
PLAY DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD POTTED A 
BALL 
HOW CAN 
THAT PASS YOU BY BALL HOW CAN THAT PASS YOU BY WILLIE 
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU TAKE WILLIE YOUR EYE OFF THE REDS MOVING AROUND 
YOU 
WALK BACK 
SEAT AS HE SAT 
DOWN I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALLEN 
CHAMBERLAIN SAID DOES HE SPEAK 
GOOD ENGLISH BUT HE WAS VERY 
BEMUSED ABOUT IT WASN'T HE IT WAS 
GREAT TO SEE IT WHEN HE CAME OUT 
OF THE AUDITORIUM THE OTHER DAY 
HE IS TURNING INTO A CROWD 
FAVOURITE 
HE IS FLYING THE FLAG FAVOURITE FOR CHINA NOW ALL THE BOYS HAVE 
PRACTISED WITH HIM UP AT THE 
ACADEMY JOHN HIGGINS RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN RONNIE SAID HE SOME 
PLAYER THIS FELLOW IT IS O. K. DOING 
IT IN THE PRACTICE BUT HE IS DOING 
IT HERE ACTION NOW FROM 
THE OTHER 
IT HERE TABLE IN THE CRUCIBLE THIS EVENING 
AUSTRALIA'S NEIL ROBERTSON PLAYING 
SCOTLAND'S STEPHEN MAGUIRE IT WAS 
A NIGHTMARE FIRST SESSION THAN NEIL 
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A THIRTEEN TO ZERO AT THE 
CRUCIBLE LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN 
FRAME NINE NEIL IS FIVE POINTS UP 
WITH COMMENTARY FROM TERRY 
GRIFFITHS AND NEAL FOULDS 
ONCE AGAIN NEIL ROBERTSON THERE 
SIMILAR TO WHAT HE DONE ON AN AREA 
BROWN HE HAS REALLY TAKEN A BIT OF 
A SLASH AT THAT ONE L. COULDN'T SEE 
ANY WAY HE COULD GET ON THE PINK 
ONCE AGAIN POT THE BLUE HERE 
PLAYED A GOOD SAFETY ON THE PINK 
AND WAIT FOR A BETTER CHANCE 
NO POT TAKEN ON THEIR OF COURSE 
NOW THEN THIS IS WHAT I DON'T 
UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES THE SHOT IS A 
MORE DIFFICULT SHOT THAN THE 
PREVIOUS BLUE BUT IF HE TOOK THIS 
ON COULD UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE THE 
CUE BALL IS GOING TO TRAVEL UP AND 
DOWN THE TABLE AND MAKE IT BACK 
DOWN FOR THE PINK 
THAT HE 
REQUIRES 
TO WIN THE FRAME BUT THE SHOT IF 
HE PLAYS IT AT A GOOD PACE IS JUST 
AS EASY TO POT AS THE ONE HE JUST 
TOOK ON ANYWAY HE HAS OPTED FOR 
SAFETY THIS IS A VERY STRANGE 
FRAME AS NEAL FOULDS HAS MENTIONED 
A NUMBER OF TIMES 
THAT WAS AN EXTREMELY GOOD SHOT AS 
WELL L. THINK HE HAS ACTUALLY GOT 
THE COVER BEHIND THE PINK WITH THE 
BLACK UP THERE IT IS NOT NICE 
THIS HE DOES PLAY SWERVE AGAINST 
THE NAP THAT IS ANOTHER PRETTY 
HAZARDOUS SHOT REALLY SO MY WORD 
I WOULDN'T FANCY THIS 
YOU SEE THE LINE THERE THE SWERVED 
LOOKS A GOOD OPTION TO ME THIS 
I THINK HE HAS GOT TO PLAY IT WITH 
A BIT OF LEFT HAND SIDE HE PLAYED 
IT THE OTHER SIDE WELL MY WORD 
HE HAS PUT THE BLACK IN THE GAME 
NOW WONDER IF HE FEELS NIKE IS 
BEATEN IN THIS MATCH ALREADY TERRY 
HE HAS PLAYED SOME SHOTS TONIGHT 
HIS EIGHT ZERO DOWN BUT HE IS PLAYING 
SOME SHOTS AS IF HE HAS GONE OUT OF 
THE TOURNAMENT CAN'T BELIEVE THE 
SHOT WAS PLAYED LIKE THAT TO PUSH 
THE BLACK OUT IT WAS ALWAYS ON THE 
WAY HE PLAYED IT 
IT IS THE LONGEST FRAME IN THE 
MATCH SO FAR JUST SHORT OF FORTY 
MINUTES 
HE SAW THE HAND GO UP IN OTHER 
WORDS DISAPPOINTMENT THAT BREAK 
WASN'T RIGHT THAT THE BREAK 
BALLS HAVE BEEN FLYING AROUND THE 
TABLE IN THE FIRST FRAME OF THE 
NIGHT HER THINK NEIL ROBERTSON IS 
OUT THERE TO PLAY SHOTS TONIGHT HE 
HAD SUCH DISASTER SESSION 
YESTERDAY SOMETIMES THEY CAN GO IN 
AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT MIGHT 
HAPPEN HERE AND THEN AGAIN OUT 
ONCE AGAIN HE HAS A RECORD OUT A 
LITTLE BIT ONCE AGAIN HE HAS 
BEEN CAUGHT OUT LITTLE BIT L. 
COULD NOT SEE A BAD CONTACT THERE 
SO HE MUST HAVE JUST MISSED JUDGED 
THIS FIELD MISJUDGED A VERY 
GOOD RECOVERY 
PINK ALSO GOES INTO THE LEFT MIDDLE 
HE HAS GOT ANOTHER CHOICE 
ALL CREDIT THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT 
THE RED WAS NOT IN THE WAY BUT IT 
WAS A BIT OF A DISTRACTION YOU 
JUST FEEL THAT ROBINSON IS GOING TO 
HAVE A GO AT A FEW CHANCE HIS ARM 
THE SHOT HE PLAYED IN A MEMBER WAS 
ABSOLUTELY SUPERB HE REALLY HAS TO 
GO ON AND WIN A FRAME FROM THIS 
IN THE REDS WAS ABSOLUTELY A A A 
AND WELL WE ARE IN THE TENTH 
FRAME AND THIS IS THE FIRST FIFTY 
BREAK GET ROBINSON HAS HAD ANNE 
ROBINSON L. CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST FIFTY BREAK THAT ROBINSON 
HAS HAD HE DID NOT GET A LOT OF 
CHANCES YESTERDAY 
HEY IT HAS BEEN A GOOD DAY FOR 
STILL WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE OF 
THIS DIRE WILL PLAY FROM THIS YOUNG 
MAN L. AM SURE IT HURT HIM 
YESTERDAY THE WAY THE SESSION WENT 
NOW THE PRESSURE IS ON HIM BECAUSE 
IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS GOING TO WIN A 
FRAME EVEN STEPHEN MAGUIRE SAW THE 
FUNNY SIDE OF THAT ONE 
WELL HE 
HASN'T WON IT YET HE NEEDS THE RED 
YES 
A LITTLE BIT OVER THE TOP BUT IT 
ENTERTAINS THE CROWD 
THERE IS THE BREAK AND HE HAS 
NEVER REALLY BEEN OUT OF POSITION 
THIS IS MUCH MORE LIKE THE ROBERTS 
AND WE SAW AGAINST ONE ROBERT 
SEN WE SAW AGAINST BOND 
ROBERTSON THE HIGHEST BREAK OF THE 
TOURNAMENT IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY FROM RONNIE AND 
SEVEN FROM RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
IT IS NATURAL TO ME THAT RED IF HE 
FEELS IT WILL HELP HIM A SERIOUS 
SHOW OF ANNOYANCE FROM ROBERTSON 
BUT HE HAS AT LAST GOT FRAME ON THE BOARD 
THERE IS NOTHING HUMOROUS ABOUT 
THIS FOR ROBERTSON L. WAS GOING TO 
ASK YOU WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE AT 
THE END OF SUCH A HEAVY DEFEAT 
I'M SURE IT HAS NEVER HAPPEN TO YOU 
I AM AFRAID IT HAS L. WAS BEATEN IN 
MY DEBUT YOUR BIGGEST DEFEAT I I THINK IT WAS TONY DRAGO HE BEAT ME 
THIRTEEN SIX BUT IT DID NOT TAKE THAT 
LONG ANYWAY L. WAS NINE ONE DOWN IN 
THE CRUCIBLE I CANNOT REMEMBER 
WHAT YEAR IT WAS 
IT HAS GONE BY 
ME 
NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE I THINK L. CANNOT ME REMEMBER WHO I WAS PLAYING BUT I 
WAS NINE ONE DOWN AND I CAME BACK 
HOW DO YOU ADDRESS SUCH A 
SITUATION PLAY EACH BALL AS IT 
COMES 
YES YOU JUST LOOK AT EACH COMES BALL AND THINK THAT WILL GIVE ME A 
CHANCE 
JOHN VIRGO AND CLIVE CHANCE EVERTON ARE IN THE COMMENTARY BOX 
I DO FEEL THAT WILLIAMS HAS GOT AT 
LEAST TWO PREFERABLY THREE OF THE 
REMAINING FALL FRAMES OF THIS 
SEASON OF THIS EVENING 
REMAINING FOUR FRAMES OF THIS 
EVENING 
O'SULLIVAN'S LEFT HANDED BREAK OFF 
SHOT LEAVES OF WILLIAMS THE SORT OF 
LONG RED HE IS PRETTY GOOD AT 
LEAVES WILLIAMS 
AS LONG REDS GO THAT ONE WAS 
PRETTY AND COMPLICATED A NATURAL 
ANGLE ROUND THE BACK OF THE BLACK 
NICELY STROKED IN 
THIS IS A DECENT 
OPPORTUNITY THESE COUPLE OF REDS 
JUST ABOVE THE BLACK THEY ARE 
NICELY IN OPEN PLAY JUST RUN FAR 
ENOUGH 
I AM SURPRISED HE HAS LEFT THIS 
MUCH ANGLE ON THE BLACK 
THERE WAS A BIT MORE ANGLE ON THAT 
THAN I AM SURE HE WOULD HAVE LIKED 
BUT IT HAS CAUSED HIM TO MISS THE 
BLACK IT WAS A CARELESS POSITIONAL 
SHOT IT WAS CARELESS TO BE THAT 
MUCH ANGLE ON THE BLACK 
THE FACT THAT O'SULLIVAN'S HIT IT 
SMACK ON THE NOSE ME IS THAT 
WILLIAMS IS IN NO PARTICULAR 
DIFFICULTY 
RONNIE HAS DECIDED TO COME OFF THE 
MAIN BUNCH NOW HE HAS MISSED THE 
BLUE IT IS NOT BAD BUT IT IS NOT 
GREAT BECAUSE HE HAS 
LEFT THE 
CHANCE OF POT ON WAS NOT 
THINKING HE COULD LEAVE ANYTHING 
HE IS TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF A 
CHANCE HERE LEAVING THIS RED YOU 
KNOW WHERE THE COLOUR COMES FROM IF 
IT GOES IN 
WELL WILLIAMS UNFORTUNATE HAVING 
MISSED THAT RED HE FINISHED SECOND 
NEAR THE POCKET HE GOT A PRETTY 
GOOD LENGTH ON THE CUE BALL THAT 
IS NOT MUCH DEFENCE AGAINST A RED 
LIGHT THIS LIKE THIS 
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE BEEN ON 
THE BLACK LOOK AT ALL THOSE REDS 
THERE IS NO CHANCE OF THE BLUE AS 
I SAY MOST OF THE REDS ARE GOING 
INTO THE RIGHT CORNER WHICH IS 
COVERED BY THE BLACK 
HE NEEDS PRETTY PRECISE POSITIONAL SHOT HERE HE JUDGED THAT HE HAD A MUCH BETTER 
CHANCE OF GETTING POSITION FROM 
BLUE TO CORNER RATHER THAN BLUE TO 
MIDDLE HE COULD NOT HAVE GOT BACK 
TO THIS SIDE OF THE TABLE IF HE HAD 
ATTEMPTED BLUE TO MIDDLE TOO THIN 
HE HAS ON THE BLACK QUITE A BIT OF 
DISTANCE HE IS HE COULD HAVE PLAYED IT BETTER 
DISAPPOINTED THAT HE DID NOT GET ON 
THE RED THICKER TO LEAVE HIMSELF ON 
THE BLACK 
YES HE WENT THE BRAVE 
MAN ROUTE THERE IF HE HAD PLAYED 
IT WITH A BIT MORE PACE AND GONE UP 
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF HE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN 
ON THE BLUE BUT 
AS YOU SAY HE JUST MISSED THE 
CANNON HE IS WALKING ROUND THE 
TABLE L. T. HE IS JUST TRYING TO 
CALM HIMSELF DOWN I THINK HE IS 
HE IS VERY ANNOYED HE HASN'T EASY 
SAFETY ON A PINK THAT IS RONNIE'S 
EQUIVALENT OF COUNTING TO TEN HE 
IS ON AN EASY SAFETY WHEN THE PINK 
ON THE PINK 
A GOOD SAFETY FROM WILLIAMS THE 
SAFETY DUEL HAVING BEEN INITIATED 
BY O'SULLIVAN 
SO THIS IS HOW O'SULLIVAN LOST 
POSITION NOT MAKING THE CANNON FOR 
THE ENOUGH THAT IS WHAT HE WAS 
TRYING TO DO FULL ENOUGH 
THAT WAS A GOOD POT ON THE RED A 
LOT BETTER THAN IT LOOKED NOT THE BEST OF CHANCES 
JUST HAVING A LOOK TO SEE IF HE CAN 
POT THE BLACK IF HE COULD POT IT 
HE COULD BRING 
AND THE 
TRUE REDS INTO PLAY ULSTER TWO 
REDS INTO PLAY THIS IS THE KEY 
SHOT NOW THE BLACK IS NOT A 
CERTAINTY WITH PACE SO HE HAS TO 
BE CAREFUL IN IT GOES BRINGS THE 
REDS INTO PLAY A FRAME WINNING 
CHANCE NOW 
O'SULLIVAN ENGAGING HIS HIGH A GEAR 
IS NOW THAT IS THE TEN FRAME WITH 
FORTY EIGHT CLEARANCE TENTH FRAME WITH A 
FORTY EIGHT CLEARANCE 
THIS IS WHERE HE GOES THREE AHEAD 
IT SEEMS 
YES THIS BLACK AND ONE 
MORE RED REQUIRED YOU WOULD NOT 
EXPECT HIM TO MISS THE RED BUT HE 
WAS HOPING TO BE STRAIGHTER 
NO PROBLEM THAT IS FRAME BALL THE 
BLUE JUST UNDERLINES IT AGGREGATE AGGREGATE POINTS ALMOST LEVEL BUT THAT IS 
OF NO ACCOUNT COMPARED TO THE FRAME 
SCORE 
A BREAK OF FIFTY WHICH INCREASES 
O'SULLIVAN'S LEAD TO EIGHT TO FIVE BARRING 
SNOOKERS THAT IS IT YES YES 
NORMALLY YOU WOULD 
EXPECT HIM TO PLAY TO LEAVE REDS ON 
HE COULD NOT DO THAT HE POT THE 
BLACK HE POTS THE BLACK 
THIRTY NINE BEHIND NOW TWENTY SEVEN REMAINING THAT 
EQUATES TO THREE SNOOKERS TO DRAW 
THAT IS A BIG ASK 
WELL THEY HAVE GOT TO BE GOOD 
SNOOKERS FOR O'SULLIVAN TO MISS 
THEM THAT IS QUITE A GOOD ONE BUT 
O'SULLIVAN IS STILL FAVOURED OFF 
TWO CUSHIONS STILL TWO MORE SNOOKERS REQUIRED 
A GOOD EFFORT HE DID NOT GET 
ENOUGH SIDE ON THE CUE BALL 
WILLIAMS GIVES THE NOD IT IS EIGHTY FIVE TO 
O'SULLIVAN O'SULLIVAN YOU'RE READING OF THE GAME 
THAT IS 
THE FIRST TIME IN THIS TOURNAMENT 
THAT I HAVE SEEN O'SULLIVAN FANCY 
THE JOB L. HAVE BEEN APPREHENSIVE 
ABOUT SAYING THAT HE IS TOURNAMENT 
FAVOURITE HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE 
HE FANCIES THIS JOB AGAIN 
WHAT DO 
YOU THINK 
THERE WAS ONE THING THEY 
WHEN HE RAN OUT OF POSITION HE 
MADE A GESTURE WITH HIS CUE HE DID 
NOT GET THE 
CANNON ON 
THE 
RED TO 
THE HIMSELF IN THE BLACK BUT VIRGO SAID IT WAS 
HIS WAY 
OF 
COUNTING TO 
TEN I THINK THAT WAS A 
GOOD SIGN FOR RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HE 
WENT BACK HE HAD A BITTER LAUGH 
AND HE WAS COMPOSED HE CLEARED UP 
WORRYING TIMES FOR MARK WILLIAMS 
WHEN YOU LET RONNIE GET THREE 
FRAMES IN FRONT HE IS VERY 
DANGEROUS I DO NOT BLAME HIM FOR 
GOING OUT AGAIN HE WILL TRY TO 
COMPOSE HIMSELF 
I THINK IT HE 
SHARES THE SESSION NOW I MEAN AS 
LONG AS YOU DON'T LOSE ANOTHER 
SESSION THIS WAY WEST WAY DRAW IT 
OR LOSE IT AGAINST SOMEONE LIKE 
O'SULLIVAN IT IS TOUGH TO COME 
BACK 
KEEP IN TOUCH AND YOU HAVE A BACK CHANCE TO COME BACK ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY OVERALL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE TWO 
PLAYERS THEY BOTH KNOW ABOUT THESE 
SITUATIONS THEY HAVE BEEN IN FIVE 
FINALS BETWEEN THEM THEY ARE NOT 
DAUNTED BY ANYTHING AT THE CRUCIBLE 
MARK WILLIAMS MUST STILL THINK HE 
IS IN WITH GREAT CHANCE EVEN 
THOUGH IT IS A TOUGH SITUATION I I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU HE HAS HAD A 
TOUGH SEASON A PLAYER OF HIS CLASS 
HE WAS POSSIBLY GOING OUT OF THE 
TOP THIRTY TWO EARLIER THIS SEASON 
SOMETHING WAS GOING WRONG SOMEWHERE 
MAYBE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH PRACTICE 
SOMETHING HE HAS BEEN THERE AND 
DONE IT BUT NOT FOR QUITE SOMETIME 
HOW DO YOU STOP THE WORRYING 
THOUGHTS COMING INTO YOUR HEAD 
TOWARDS THE END OF THE SESSION IF 
YOU GO ANOTHER ONE BEHIND YOU 
THINK IT IS GOOD NIGHT 
I WAS WITH 
TERRY GRIFFITHS WHEN HE WAS 
COACHING MARK WILLIAMS L. WOULD BE 
TELLING HIM ALL ABOUT THE TIMES 
THAT I WAS WINNING HERE THAT IS 
THE KIND OF THING YOU NEED TO 
HAVING 
YOUR HEAD 
WHEN YOU 
ARE OUT 
THERE AS I SAY YOU COULD DO WITH 
TAKING WHAT TWO FRAMES LEFT 
BACK AT THE TABLE THE MATCH 
RESUMES 
WILLIAMS'S SUPPORTERS MAY BE 
GETTING AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING 
THAT HE HAS MISSED THE BOAT WHEN HE 
FAILED TO POT FRAME BALL FORTY FIVE TO FIVE 
FORTY FIVE TO FIVE FORTY FIVE TO FIVE 
STILL NO JOY MUCH FOR O'SULLIVAN 
IN THE LONG GAME DEPARTMENT 
FOUR EVERYTHING IS TOP DRAWER FROM 
RONNIE AT THE MOMENT EVERYTHING 
THE CUE BALL NEEDED TO RUN ON TO 
THE BAULK CUSHION STILL A WAY OUT 
OF COURSE HE STILL HAS A CHANCE TO 
LEVEL AT EIGHT TO EIGHT THAT OTHER POSITIVE 
THOUGHTS HE NEEDS TO HAVE THAT 
SO THE POSITIVE THOUGHTS THOSE 
ARE THE POSITIVE THOUGHTS 
WELL IT WAS A VERY AGGRESSIVE 
SAFETY SHOT FROM RONNIE HE SENT A 
RED OVER EITHER CORNER POCKET BUT 
HE HAS NOT LEFT ANYTHING AND NOW 
MARK HAS A PROBLEM IT IS NOT GOING 
TO BE THE EASIEST SAFETY SHOT TO 
PLAY HERE IS HIS VIEW THERE IS A 
RED THAT HE CAN JUST GET PAST THE 
PINK L. THINK THAT IS THE MOST 
OBVIOUS ONE JUST PAST THE PINK HE 
HAS TO AVOID THE KISS ON THE BLACK 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE RED NEAR THE 
POCKET THERE 
IS 
NO WAY 
HE CAN GET 
TO THAT UNLESS HE PLAYED A SWERVE 
BUT I THINK IF HE GETS PAST THE 
PINK HE HAS TO JUST CATCH THIS RED 
RIGHT 
WELL YOU ARE THE BILLIARD PLAYER 
CLIVE I THINK HE PLAYED A CANNON 
THERE 
WELL MAYBE HE HAD THE IDEA THERE OF MOVING THE RED 
THE SECOND RED WAS TIGHT ON THE 
CUSHION ALBEIT ONLY THREE OR FOUR 
INCHES FROM THE POCKET BUT THE IN 
OFF HIS JUST ABOUT THE WORST 
POSSIBLE RESULT IS JUST ABOUT 
THE EASIEST OF REDS STARTERS FOR 
O'SULLIVAN AND WE ALL KNOW HOW 
HEAVILY HE IS SCORING WHEN THE 
BALLS ARE OPEN 
YES AND IF RONNIE 
CAN WIN THIS FRAME OF COURSE HE 
WOULD BE GUARANTEED A TO FRAME LEAD 
AT LEAST GOING INTO THE FINAL 
SESSION TOMORROW IT TWO FRAME 
LEAD 
A TWO FRAME LEAD JUST OVERRAN IT 
SLIGHTLY BECAUSE THERE IS A RED IN 
THE BAULK END HE COULD HAVE PLAYED 
THE BLUE HERE 
MAYBE THIS WILL BE AN EXCEPTION 
BUT IT IS VERY RARE IN THIS SORT OF 
POSITION THAT O'SULLIVAN DOES NOT 
TAKE MAJOR ADVANTAGE 
WELL THAT IS NOT HIS BEST 
POSITIONAL SHOT OBVIOUSLY THIS 
RED HE IS PLAYING GOES BUT HE 
WOULD HAVE WANTED TO BE STRAIGHT ON 
IT BUT ONCE AGAIN HE SWITCHES 
HANDS IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE ANY 
DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER 
NOW HE IS JUST HAVING A LOOK HE IS 
STRAIGHT ON THE BLUE HE MAY WANT 
TO STOP THE CUE BALL WHERE THE BLUE 
IS HERE AND THEN HE 
CAN GET 
THROUGH 
TO 
THE RED 
THAT IS CLOSEST 
TO THE CORNER 
THE REMAINING DIFFICULTY CORNER RESIDES IN THE FACT THAT ALL THE 
REDS ARE OVER ON THE RIGHT HAND 
SIDE OF THE TABLE A LITTLE BIT 
CONGESTED BUT I DON'T THINK 
ULTIMATELY IT WILL BE MUCH 
PROTECTION FOR WILLIAMS THAT 
WELL HE IS ON THE PINK TO THE 
MIDDLE A LITTLE BIT TOO CLOSE TO 
THE CUSHION FOR COMFORT 
HE MADE IT LOOK EASY DIDN'T HE 
WHERE DOES THE PINK GO IS IT STILL 
AVAILABLE YES IT'S O. K. 
PLAYING A DEEP SCREW MAKING SURE 
HE WAS NOT SHORT ON THE BLUE HE 
KNEW WOULD BE ON BAULK COLOUR 
BUT AS YOU SAY CLIVE THESE REDS 
ARE LITTLE BIT AWKWARD IT IS NOT 
THAT STRAIGHTFORWARD IF HE PLAYED 
THE BROWN HE COULD COME ROUND OFF 
TWO CUSHIONS IT IS A BETTER OPTION 
THAN THE STRAIGHT GREEN 
A LOT MORE SPACE ROUND THE PINK 
SPOT NOW 
JUST STOPPED HIMSELF 
THERE HE WAS AT FULL STRETCH HE'S 
PRETTY MUCH AT FULL STRETCH HERE 
HAS HE GOT ON THE BLUE RIGHT JUST 
ABOUT 
HE WAS A BIT STRAIGHTER THAN I 
THOUGHT 
REALLY BEGINNING TO DELIVER THAT 
CUE 
I'M SURE WILLIAMS FEARED THE WORST 
FROM THE MOMENT HE WENT IN OFF 
O'SULLIVAN DID HAVE TO OVERCOME 
COUPLE OF MINOR DIFFICULTIES BUT 
HE HAS NEVER LOOKED LIKE MISSING 
HE IS IN FULL FLIGHT NOW 
THE STRAIGHT MISS ON THE BLACK MAY 
PREVENT HIM MAKING A CENTURY THE 
STRAIGHTNESS 
DEEPER TROUBLE FOR WILLIAMS 
O'SULLIVAN INCREASES HIS LEAD TO NINE 
FIVE FIVE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN INTO HIS STRIDE 
I THINK IS THE FIRST TIME IN THE 
TOURNAMENTS THAT HE 
LOOKS NOW 
HE 
WANTS TO 
PLAY IN 
THIS WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP WAS A BIT YESTERDAY 
IN THE 
FIRST SCENT 
FIRST SESSION L. WAS DEATHLY 
WORRIED IT 
IN THE 
OPENING MATCH 
AGAINST THE 
CHINESE THAT 
HE 
IS NOW 
IN FULL FLIGHT HE 
IS MORE 
FOCUSED 
IN FULL FLIGHT HE IS MORE FOCUSED NOW JOHN MENTIONED 
IN COMMENTARY 
NOW JOHN MENTIONED IN COMMENTARY DELIVERING THE CUE MUCH 
STRAIGHT LINE 
ALL 
GOING STRIKE IN 
THE MIDDLE 
RIGHT 
IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE POCKET 
YESTERDAY HE 
WAS LEAVING 
MARK 
CHANCES MARK 
KNOWS NOW 
THAT HE IS 
NOT GOING 
TO GET 
MANY CHANCES 
BECAUSE RONNIE 
IS DOING SO 
RONNIE HAS 
OVER THE 
COURSE OF 
THE SEASON 
SO HE 
HAS BEEN 
IN CONSISTENT 
FORM AND 
HAS 
BEEN TELLING EVERYONE 
HOW HE 
WANTS 
TO GET 
HIS 
WORLD 
ABOUT HIM 
WHEN HE 
WAS EIGHTY FIVE 
IN FRONT 
AGAINST MARK SELBY AND LOST FRAMES 
I DIDN'T 
THINK HE 
HAD GOT 
OVER IT 
WHEN HE 
CAME HERE 
MARK 
WILLIAMS NOW HAS TWO FRAMES TO GO 
AND 
FOR ME 
HE HAS TO WIN BOTH I 
I THINK IT WAS THE WELSH OPEN MARK 
SELBY DID 
GET 
TO RONNIE 
AND 
RONNIE ADMITS THAT 
HIM AT 
THE END 
I THINK HE 
IS UP 
FOR THIS WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER 
THE CONTROVERSY 
THAT FOLLOWED WHAT 
HAPPENED 
IN CHINA 
AT 
HIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE WHEN 
HE SAID A 
FEW 
UNFORTUNATE 
THINGS I 
THINK 
UNFORTUNATE THINGS I THINK SOMETIMES DO 
YOU THINK 
RONNIE USES 
SOMETIMES DO YOU THINK RONNIE USES THINGS LIKE THAT 
SAY I'M GOING TO 
HAVE A RIGHT 
GO 
HERE AND SHOW THEM 
FOR ME GUMMY 
CAN SOMETIMES BE TOO LAID BACK 
OBVIOUSLY HE WAS UNFORTUNATE 
THINKING IT 
WAS NOT 
ON AIR IT 
AN ACCIDENT HE IS THE GREAT 
AN ACCIDENT ENTERTAINER THESE THINGS ARE TO 
HAPPEN WHETHER 
IT IS 
WRONG IT IS 
GOING TO 
HEADLINES AND WILL HAVE RUSSELL 
TALKING ABOUT IT 
AND HE 
CAN DO 
WHAT 
HE DOES 
AROUND THE TABLE THAT 
THAT IS WHAT 
THE GAME IS 
ALL ABOUT 
IT IS 
WHAT HE 
DOES AROUND THE 
TABLE AND 
THAT IS 
WHY THE 
CROWDS ALL 
AROUND 
THE WORLD LOVE HIM 
WILLIAMS MISSES THE 
INITIAL LONG RED JUST 
TAKING UP 
THE POINT MADE IN THE STUDIO 
O'SULLIVAN DID 
SAY AFTER 
HIS FIRST 
MATCH THAT THE INCIDENT IN CHINA 
AND ITS AFTERMATH HAVING TO 
APOLOGISE TO ALL AND SUNDRY 
SEVERAL PHONE CALLS AND ALL THAT 
DID UPSET HIS PREPARATION FOR THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
WELL RONNIE YOU CHAMPIONSHIP PUSHED THE BALL OUT THERE DEAR ME 
THAT WAS A 
RISKY 
PLANT TO 
HE HAD A 
LOOK HE THOUGHT IT WAS 
NEAR ENOUGH 
A CERTAINTY TO GO IN SO MARK 
WILLIAMS YOU WON'T GET BETTER 
CHANCES THAN THIS NEED TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF IT 
WELL HE NEEDS TO 
WIN THE FRAME AT THIS WITH THE REDS 
SPREAD AS 
THEY ARE 
HE WOULD BE VERY VULNERABLE TO A 
COUNTER ATTACK 
THIS WAS THE PLANT THAT HE WAS 
LOOKING AS BUT NOW HE IS LOOKING 
AT WILLIAMS 
YES AND JUST LOOKING 
AT THAT PLANT AND THEY LOOKS SPOT 
ON FOR 
THE POCKET BUT 
THERE WAS A 
GAP BETWEEN THEM 
PLAYING IT THAT 
HARD AS 
HE HAD TO 
DO TO 
GET THE 
CUE 
BALL OUT OF 
THE REDS 
HE ONLY 
GOT 
THE FIRST RED JUST OFFLINE AND IT 
WOULD NOT HAVE GONE IN HE HAD A 
GOOD LOOK AT IT BUT 
AS I 
SAY IT 
WAS THE 
PACE HE 
WAS HAVING 
TO PLAY 
IT 
THAT HE 
JUST CAUGHT 
THE FIRST 
RED JUST 
A FRACTION OFF 
COURSE WHEN 
ALL THE 
OTHER REDS 
IT LOOKS 
LIKE A VERY WILD SHOT IT 
COULD HAVE 
COST HIM 
THE FRAME IN 
ONE HIT 
IT IS CERTAINLY A GOOD 
CHANCE TO END O'SULLIVAN'S THREE 
FRAME WINNING STREAK THE RED HE 
INTENDED TO PLANT STRUCK ABOUT 
THREE INCHES UP THE RIGHT HAND SIDE 
CUSHION 
JUST ABOUT O. K. NEARLY RAN AN INCH 
TOO FAR BUT HE'S ALL 
RIGHT HERE 
HE 
CAN POT 
THE RED 
AND CONTROL 
CUE BALL THAT'S THE MAIN THING 
AND THIS IS A CREDITABLE EFFORT 
THIS AND 
ALL THE 
BALLS ARE 
ALL IN 
THE OPENING 
IN 
THE OPEN 
BUT WHEN 
YOU CONSIDER 
HE DIDN'T 
SCORE A 
POINT IN THE LAST FRAME AND TWO FRAMES BEFORE 
THAT HE 
SCORED 
FORTY TWO POINTS 
HE HAS NOT 
HAD 
LOT OF TABLE TIME 
SO THIS 
IS 
LOT OF TABLE TIME SO THIS IS EVERY CREDIT MARK 
FOR TAKING THIS 
OPPORTUNITY I KNOW 
THEY WERE 
THERE BUT 
THEY STILL HAVE TO BE 
THERE BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO BE POTTED EVERY CREDIT TO MARK 
ONCE HE POTS THIS RED THERE WILL 
ONLY BE SIXTY SEVEN 
REMAINING SO 
A RED 
AND 
A PINK 
WOULD BE ENOUGH WELL PLAYED 
MARK GOOD PERFORMANCE 
O'SULLIVAN NOT TOO BOTHERED ABOUT 
THIS HE IS STILL GOING TO 
BE THREE 
FRAMES IN FRONT AT NINE TO SIX 
SUCH A CALM UNRUFFLED EFFORT THIS 
FROM WILLIAMS 
UNSUCCESSFUL PLANT FROM O'SULLIVAN 
EIGHTY ONE BREAK FROM WILLIAMS WILLIAMS 
REDUCES O'SULLIVAN'S LEAD TO NINE TO SIX 
SO MARK HAS GIVEN HIMSELF A 
LIFELINE WHAT DO THINK DENNIS 
RONNIE LOOKED AS IF HE MADE A 
THE 
RECKLESS SHOT BUT HE SCATTERED THE BALLS EVERYWHERE BUT FAIR PLAY TO 
MARK HE NEEDED TO TAKE THEM THIS 
FRAME IS OF 
PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE 
FRAME IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE HE COULD ISN'T IT FUNNY 
THE WAY IT 
CHANGES 
FROM FRAME TO FRAME 
I ONCE AN 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY CALLED 
FRAME BY

SO 
MUCH TO

FRAME THAT APPLIES SO MUCH TO THIS GAME DENNIS
