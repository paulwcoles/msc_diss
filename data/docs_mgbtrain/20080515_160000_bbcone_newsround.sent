ARE NETTLES THAT BAD OR 
DO THEY HAVE A SOFTER SIDE L. HAVE 
COME TO MEET A MAN WITH A WHO 
KNOWS WHY DO NETTLES STING THE THE NEEDLE LIKE HAIRS THEY HAVE A 
CHEMICAL THAT IRRITATES THE SKIN 
WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU GET STUNG 
SOME SAY THERE'S A PLANT THAT GROWS 
AROUND THE NETTLES CALLED A DOC 
PLANT IF YOU RUB IT ON THE STING 
IT SHOULD MAKE IT STING LESS 
THERE'S NO ACTUAL EVIDENCE MAYBE 
LOOKING FOR THE PLANTS TAKE YOUR 
MIND OFF IT 
NETTLES CAN BE USED TO 
MAKE SOUP TEA AND MEDICINE AND 
THEY ARE IMPORTANT FOR WILDLIFE
