HITTING A BALL AGAINST A WALL LIKE THIS PERSON IN A SQUASH COURT 
WILL HAVE A BIG EFFECT ON THE BALL 
IT TAKES ONE HUNDREDTH OF A SECOND FOR THE BALL TO GET FROM THE RACKET TO THE WALL 
LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE SLOW THE ACTION DOWN 
WHEN THE BALL HITS THE WALL 
IT CHANGES SHAPE AND DIRECTION REALLY QUICKLY 
WHEN THE BALL PUSHES ON THE WALL 
THE WALL PUSHES BACK AND THE BALL IS SQUASHED ALMOST FLAT 
BEFORE IT SPRINGS BACK TO ITS NORMAL SHAPE AND TRAVELS BACK 
THIS IS COVENT GARDEN IN LONDON IT'S FULL OF MUSIC AND LIFE 
IT'S ALSO HOME TO A REALLY UNUSUAL TOY SHOP 
THE CABARET MECHANICAL THEATRE 
THE ONE THING YOU'LL NOTICE IS THAT THIS MUSIC'S REALLY LOUD IN HERE 
I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT MUSIC BEFORE 
IF YOU LOOK VERY CLOSELY INSIDE IT'S FULL OF HIDDEN TREASURES HERE 
EVERYTHING COMES TO LIFE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
THE CLEVER THING ABOUT ALL THESE MODELS IS WHAT'S MAKING THEM WORK 
IN THE SHOP THEY'RE ALL LINKED TO AN ELECTRIC MOTOR 
IF I PRESS THE BUTTON I TURN ON THE POWER AND EVERYTHING STARTS TO WORK 
BUT WHAT MAKES MODELS LIKE THIS ONE REALLY SPECIAL 
IS THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY NEED ELECTRICITY 
IN FACT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO WORK JUST AS WELL BY HAND 
THAT'S WHY IT'S GOT A HANDLE RIGHT HERE AND IF I JUST TURN IT 
THE MODEL STARTS TO WORK 
I COULD HAVE PLAYED WITH THOSE TOYS ALL DAY 
BUT INSTEAD I WANTED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE WAY THEY WORKED 
SO I WENT TO MEET KEITH NEWSTEAD THE MAN THAT MAKES THEM 
YOU'RE WORKING ON MY FAVOURITE HERE SO I'LL TRY NOT TO DISTURB YOU 
BUT I WILL START PLAYING O. K. WHAT'S THE APPEAL MAKING THESE MODELS 
I'VE ALWAYS MADE MODELS 
WHEN I WAS YOUNG I MADE MODELS BUT THEY DIDN'T MOVE 
I SAW A PROGRAMME ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO MADE MOVING MODELS 
ONCE YOU'D MADE IT YOU'D TURN A HANDLE AND SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN 
SO THE KEY QUESTION HAS TO BE KEITH THE FACT THAT ALL I'M DOING 
IS TURNING THIS WHEEL WHICH IS A VERY SIMPLE MOVEMENT 
YET I'M MAKING EVERYTHING ELSE MOVE 
LIKE THE PIG THAT COMES OUT THE DUSTBIN HOW DO YOU DO THAT 
IF YOU LOOK HERE THIS IS A PIECE OF WIRE THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE PIG 
IF I PUSH THE WIRE UP IT PUSHES THE PIG OUT OF THE DUSTBIN 
IF I PULL DOWN IT PULLS THE PIG BACK DOWN 
SO I NEED A WAY TO MAKE THIS WIRE GO UP AND DOWN 
THE EASIEST WAY IS WITH A LEVER SO IF I PUT THE WIRE INTO THE LEVER 
THE LEVER IS ATTACHED TO A SLOW WHEEL SO AS I TURN THE HANDLE 
AS THE WHEEL COMES ROUND IT PUSHES DOWN THE LEVER PULLS THE PIG DOWN 
THE LEVER GOES UP AND THAT MAKES THE PIG COME OUT OF THE DUSTBIN 
SO BASICALLY EVERYTHING'S CONNECTED 
KEITH'S TOYS WORK BY HAND 
BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY TOYS CAN MOVE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY 
SOME WORK WHEN YOU STRETCH A BIT OF ELASTIC THEN LET IT GO 
THERE ARE TOYS THAT MOVE WHEN YOU PUSH THEM KNOCK THEM OR DROP THEM 
SOME TOYS WORK BY PEDALLING AND SOME ARE BLOWN BY THE WIND 
IF THERE'S NO WIND THEN A HELPFUL PUFF OF BREATH WILL DO I HOPE 
HERE WE GO 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU CATCH A GUST OF WIND ON ONE OF THESE THINGS 
IT'S ALMOST ENOUGH TO YANK YOUR FEET OFF THE GROUND IT'S REALLY STRONG 
IN FACT IF I WAS ON WHEELS NOW THE FORCE OF THE WIND WOULD BE ENOUGH 
TO DRAG ME HURTLING RIGHT DOWN THE BEACH SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THIS BRILLIANT GADGET IS CALLED A KITE BUGGY 
ALL YOU NEED ARE WHEELS A KITE AND A GUST OF WIND 
AND YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF SOME SERIOUS SPEED 
KITE BUGGYING HAS REALLY TAKEN OFF OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS 
IT'S A BRILLIANT WAY OF TRAPPING THE POWER OF THE WIND TO MAKE MOVEMENT 
THIS WEEKEND PEOPLE ARE GATHERING TO RACE THEM 
THEY'RE HOLDING A FESTIVAL OF WIND AND WHEELS 
ALL THE DIFFERENT CRAFT ON SHOW HAD THEIR OWN WAY OF USING THE WIND 
LIKE THESE SAND YACHTS THAT SAIL ALONG LIKE A BOAT ON WHEELS 
ALL THE WHILE KITE BUGGIES BUZZED AROUND US LIKE FLIES 
THEIR ENORMOUS CANOPIES FILLED THE SKY 
AND THE BUGGIES DARTED THIS WAY AND THAT WITH AMAZING CONTROL 
THERE IS NO WAY I'M LEAVING WITHOUT HAVING A GO AT KITE BUGGYING 
I'VE GOT THE GEAR WATERPROOFS HELMET AND THE GOGGLES 
ALL I NEED IS A MAN TO SHOW ME HOW 
I THINK HE'S COMING ANY MINUTE NOW 
CHRIS AH 
GET OVER HERE CHRIS 
I WANT TO KNOW 
HI O. K. I'M COMING BACK 
HOW EASY IS IT TO CONTROL THE KITE 
QUITE EASY BUT WE'VE GOT SOME VERY STRONG WIND CONDITIONS TODAY 
I'M BEGINNING TO STRUGGLE A BIT BUT I'VE GOT IT I CAN TAKE IT 
YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME A PIGGYBACK AREN'T YOU O. K. LET'S GO 
HOW SAFE IS IT BY THE WAY 
FAIRLY SAFE I'VE GOT A SAFE TRACK RECORD UP TO NOW 
THIS IS QUITE NICE IT'S QUITE A NICE GENTLE START 
I'M GETTING TOTALLY SOAKED BACK HERE BUT IT'S A GREAT FEELING 
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN NOTHING YET I'LL TAKE YOU FOR A ROCKET RIDE
