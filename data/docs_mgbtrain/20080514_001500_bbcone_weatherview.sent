WAS ONE SPOT THAT FELT CHILLY 
THANKS TO A BRISK WIND 
COMING IN OFF THE NORTH SEA 
FEEDING IN AREAS OF CLOUD AS WELL 
PARTICULARLY DULL 
ACROSS NORTHEAST ENGLAND 
AND PARTS OF THE EAST ANGLIAN COAST 
ON THAT CONTINUING 
NORTHEASTERLY BREEZE 
THE CLOUD HAS BEEN SPREADING 
WESTWARDS THROUGH TONIGHT 
MANY PLACES ENDING THE NIGHT CLOUDY 
A BIT MISTY OVER SOME HILLS 
BUT WESTERN FRINGES STAYING CLEAR 
DRY PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE 
TEMPERATURES INTO DOUBLE FIGURES 
IN THE SOUTH BUT LOW SINGLE FIGURES 
ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS QUITE CHILLY 
A SUNNY START FOR THE MORNING 
EIGHT O'CLOCK LOTS OF SUNSHINE 
ACROSS WESTERN WALES 
A LOVELY START ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND AGAIN 
A BIT OF A NIP IN THE AIR FIRST THING 
BUT THE TEMPERATURES 
WILL SOON START TO PICK UP 
ACROSS SCOTLAND A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD 
DUMFRIES AND GALLOWAY ONE BRIGHT SPOT 
BUT PRETTY GREY PARTICULARLY TOWARDS 
THE EASTERN COAST 
AND ACROSS THE NORTHEAST OF ENGLAND 
THE CLOUD STRUGGLING 
TO CROSS THE PENNINES 
SO THE LAKE DISTRICT COULD HAVE 
A NICE START A HINT OF BRIGHTNESS 
COMING THROUGH THE CLOUD BY EIGHT 
ACROSS EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTHEAST 
YOU'RE OUT OF THE CLOUD ONCE YOU HEAD 
ACROSS WILTSHIRE INTO DORSET 
SOMERSET INTO DEVON AND CORNWALL 
HERE LOVELY BRIGHT BLUE SKIES 
ONCE THE SUN GETS TO WORK 
THAT CLOUD SHOULD CLEAR QUICKLY 
ACROSS MOST PLACES THROUGH 
THE MORNING BUT ALWAYS A STRUGGLE 
TO GET RID OF IT FROM THE EASTERNMOST 
PARTS OF ENGLAND ONCE AGAIN 
IT WILL BE COOL HERE 
IT MIGHT BREAK A LITTLE 
ACROSS LINCOLNSHIRE AND YORKSHIRE 
I SUSPECT THE NORTHEAST OF ENGLAND 
COULD STAY RATHER GREY 
AND DECIDEDLY CHILLY 
TWELVE OR THIRTEEN DEGREES AT BEST 
IN THAT NORTHEASTERLY WIND 
EDINBURGH MAYBE SEVENTEEN 
AS LONG AS THE CLOUD BREAKS 
BUT MOSTLY SCOTLAND GETTING 
SOME AFTERNOON SUNSHINE 
A BEAUTIFUL AFTERNOON 
ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
WITH BRIGHT BLUE SKIES 
AS IT WILL BE ACROSS WALES 
TEMPERATURES GETTING INTO THE LOW TWENTIES 
PARTICULARLY IN WESTERN AREAS 
AND LOVELY ON THE BEACHES IN THE SOUTHWEST TOO LOTS OF SUNSHINE 
NOTICE ONE OR TWO SHOWERS JUST HERE AND THERE 
THAT'S A RISK LATER IN THE AFTERNOON ACROSS SOUTHERNMOST PARTS OF ENGLAND 
IT WILL FEEL WARM IN THE SUNSHINE 
TEMPERATURES INTO THE LOW TWENTIES 
CHANGES ARE AFOOT 
HERE COMES THE CLOUD BACK IN FROM THE NORTH SEA 
BUT HERE COMES SOME RAIN THE FIRST FOR SOME TIME 
IN MANY SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND 
TEMPERATURES INTO DOUBLE FIGURES HERE 
BUT DOWN TO SEVEN TO NINE DEGREES 
FURTHER NORTH 
A BIG CHANGE ON THE WAY FOR THURSDAY 
A WET DAY ACROSS SOUTHERN U. K. 
CLOUDY ACROSS EASTERN SCOTLAND 
AND ENGLAND BEST OF THE SUNSHINE 
FURTHER WEST ONCE AGAIN 
EVERYWHERE FEELING COOLER BY THE END OF THE WEEK 
THESE TEMPERATURES FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN A GOOD TEN DEGREES DOWN 
ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN USED TO RECENTLY 
DRIER WEATHER THE FURTHER NORTH YOU ARE BUT AGAIN 
THERE'S A CHILL IN THE AIR 
BIG CHANGES ON THE WAY IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
THERE'S A MURDER A MYSTERY AND AGATHA CHRISTIE 
THE THRILL IS IN THE CHASE NEVER IN THE CAPTURE 
THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN 
IF ANYONE CAN SOLVE THIS IT'S YOU 
AND IF YOU MISSED THE LAST EPISODE IT'S AVAILABLE NOW ON B. B. C. IPLAYER
