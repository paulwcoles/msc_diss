I KNOW I'M NOT ENCOURAGED TO HAVE AN ENQUIRING MIND BUT WHY ARE WE GOING TO WHEREVER I'M TAKING YOU 
OUR DESTINATION IS THE MANOR HOUSE FUNCTION ROOMS IN MORETON ROAD 
I HAVE TO SEE TO THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR TODAY'S LADIES' LUNCHEON CLUB THEY RELY ON ME SO 
DOES THAT MEAN YOU WON'T BE AT HOME FOR LUNCH OF COURSE I WON'T BE AT HOME FOR LUNCH DEAR 
YOU'LL HAVE TO MANAGE ON YOUR OWN FOR ONCE 
THE MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST WILL TELL YOU THAT NINETY EIGHT PER CENT OF OUR GENES ARE IDENTICAL TO THOSE OF MONKEYS 
LESS THAN TWO PER CENT ARE SPECIFICALLY HUMAN 
SO 
SO WHY DO I WAKE UP CRAVING FOR A FAG AND NOT A BANANA 
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING OPEN UNIVERSITY AGAIN IT BROADENS YOUR INTELLECTUAL HORIZONS 
THAT'S TRUE IF IT WASN'T FOR YOUR HANDICAP YOU'D HAVE GONE FAR 
WHAT HANDICAP 
BONE IDLENESS 
THAT'S NOT A HANDICAP IT'S A PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION I'M MAKING A STATEMENT 
I WISH YOU WOULDN'T LIE THERE LOOKING CRIMINALLY ATTRACTIVE WHEN I'M READING A PASSIONATE LOVE STORY 
WELL I CAN'T STAY HERE ALL DAY 
NOW IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD GO SMOOTHLY 
WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE TODAY'S SPEAKER THE COMMODORE IS A FAMOUS ROUND THE WORLD YACHTSMAN 
THEY SAY HE DRINKS THEY SAY WHO DRINKS THE COMMODORE 
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THIS WHEN THAT SCANDAL LED TO HIS DIVORCE 
OH YES APPARENTLY HE DOES LIKE THE LADIES YOU KNOW WHAT SAILORS ARE 
NOT PERSONALLY NO I'M AFRAID IT'S PROBABLY A BIT LATE TO BEGIN REMEDYING THAT 
SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT IF WE KEEP HIM AWAY FROM THE BRANDY AND OUR MEMBERS 
I EXPECT IT'S BEEN EXAGGERATED YOU KNOW WHAT THE PAPERS ARE SO WE NEED A VOLUNTEER HELL O. 
THE BUCKET WOMAN 
GOODNESS ME NOT EVEN A QUORUM 
HOW VERY FORTUNATE I DROPPED IN 
AND THAT'S SHERIDAN IN HIS SCOUT UNIFORM 
HE MADE HIS MUMMY A LOVELY FIRE IN THE GARDEN 
SINGLE HANDEDLY AND WITH ONE MATCH HE DESTROYED THE POTTING SHED 
FASCINATING NOW WELL I'D LOVE TO STAY 
BUT I MUST FIND A VOLUNTEER TO COLLECT OUR SPEAKER FROM THE STATION 
LOOK NO FURTHER MISS WILKINSON 
I SHALL ATTEND TO THE COMMODORE PERSONALLY OH NO 
I'M SURE WE NEEDN'T BOTHER YOU MRS. BUCK BOUQUET 
LEAVE IT TO ME I SHALL TAKE THE COMMODORE UNDER MY WING 
MY HUSBAND AND I GO BOATING 
IT WILL BE VERY COMFORTING FOR THE COMMODORE TO MEET WITH HIS OWN KIND 
AND GOD BLESS ALL WHO SAIL IN HER 
GOOD MORNING ELIZABETH 
MORNING HYACINTH 
SHALL YOU BE WITH US AT THE LADIES' LUNCHEON TODAY YES I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SPEAKER 
I'VE JUST COME FROM THERE I WANTED TO ENSURE THE ARRANGEMENTS WERE SATISFACTORY 
I THOUGHT THE COMMITTEE DID THAT 
GOOD HEAVENS NO

THEY NEED MY INFLUENTIAL INPUT 
I'M OFF TO WORK THEN 
DON'T DISTURB YOURSELVES 
IT'S ONLY ME OFF TO ANOTHER DAY'S GRINDING LABOUR 
SELLING JEWELLERY DOOR TO DOOR 
STRUGGLING TO MAKE A LIVING 
I'M GOING THEN 
LUGGING A SAMPLE CASE ON HARD STREETS IN HIGH HEELS 
DON'T WEAR HIGH HEELS 
ALL I'VE GOT IS HIGH HEELS WHAT I REY NEED IS TRANSPORT 
IF I HAD TRANSPORT 
A DRIVER TO RUN ME ROUND I COULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE RANGE OF MY EARNING POWER 
WHAT ABOUT ONE OF YOUR BOYFRIENDS ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS MESS ABOUT I'M A WORKING GIRL 
I HAVEN'T TIME FOR MESSING ABOUT I REMEMBER WHEN WE USED TO MESS ABOUT 
I'LL GET THE CAR 
WHEN WE BRING THE COMMODORE HERE ON THE WAY TO LUNCH 
I'LL USE OUR GOLDEN GALLEON GLASSES THE ONES WE WERE GIVEN WHEN WE WERE INVITED ON BOARD THE MARY ROSE 
WE DIDN'T GO ON BOARD WE BOUGHT TICKETS TO SEE WHAT'S LEFT OF THE HULL 
DON'T BE PEDANTIC RICHARD 
ANYWAY THAT'S WHERE WE ACQUIRED THE GOLDEN GALLEON GLASSES AT THE MARY ROSE 
WE BOUGHT THEM AT A CAR BOOT SALE ROUND THE BACK OF THE GASWORKS 
WELL THE COMMODORE WON'T KNOW THAT DEAR 
IF THERE'S A LULL IN THE CONVERSATION YOU CAN SHOW HIM OUR BOATING PICTURES 
OH HYACINTH ONE AFTERNOON WE WENT ON THE RIVER AND YOU FELL IN 
OH RICHARD WHY ARE YOU BRINGING HIM HERE 
TO GIVE HIM SOME CONVIVIAL HOSPITALITY PRIOR TO THE OFFICIAL LUNCHEON 
I OUGHT TO INVITE A FEW FRIENDS TO MEET HIM 
OH A LIFE ON THE OCEAN WAVE 
IS BETTER THAN GOING TO SEA 
COFFEE IN TEN MINUTES EMMET BRING ELIZABETH YOU MUST COME AND HEAR MY PLANS FOR THE COMMODORE

I FELT CHINESE WAS CLOSE ENOUGH 
WHAT WAS THE NUMBER I SANG NOW HOW DID IT GO 
OH I REMEMBER HAP HAP HAP HAP HAP HAP HAPPY TALK 
TALK ABOUT THINGS WE LIKE TO DO 
THAT WAS SOUTH PACIFIC 
F. F. FOR THE COMMODORE I I'M NOT SURE THE CHINESE FLAG STRIKES QUITE THE RIGHT NOTE

YOU MUST REMEMBER SOME SEA STORIES WHY SHOULD I KNOW ANY SEA STORIES

WHEREAS THERE'S NO CURE WHATSOEVER FOR A SINGING NEIGHBOUR 
LISTEN CAREFULLY MESSAGE IMMINENT 
I SHALL BE IN THERE WITH THE COMMODORE HAVING OUR FIRST SHERRY
