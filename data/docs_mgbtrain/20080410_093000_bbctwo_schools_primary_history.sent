HI I'M ALEXANDER ALEXANDER PAPADOPOULOS 
YES IT'S GREEK 
I'M SCOTTISH BUT I'M GREEK ALSO 
THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW I LEARNT TO BE HAPPY WITH MY GREEK BACKGROUND 
AND EVEN PROUD TO BE GREEK 
MY GRANDDAD OR PAPOU AS I CALL HIM 
MADE ME LOOK IN A BOOK ALL ABOUT GREECE AND SHOWED ME 
LOTS OF THINGS THAT ARE AROUND TODAY THAT ARE THERE BECAUSE OF THE GREEKS 
YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT THERE'S GREEK STUFF EVERYWHERE 
THIS IS THE GREEK RESTAURANT PAPOU OWNS 
AND HERE I AM THESE ARE THE PEOPLE FROM MY CLASS 
AND THIS IS HELEN TEASING ME AS USUAL 
WHAT'S WRONG POPPADOM DID YOU SLIP ON SOME GREECE 
JUST ANOTHER DAY 
SOMETHING DAFT EVERY TIME 
WHAT AN IDIOT COME ON 
HERE'S PAPOU MY GRANDDAD 
YOU STILL HERE MY LITTLE ALEXANDER THE GREAT 
STILL HERE AND THE NAME'S ALEX 
A GREAT GREEK NAME 
ALEXANDER THE GREAT 
AMAZING IDENTICAL IT'S THAT STIFF BRAVE STANCE 
THAT DETERMINED BROW A FIGHTER A WINNER A CRUSHER OF THE ENEMY 
A MAN PROUD TO BE A GREEK 
I HATE MY NAME AND I HATE BEING GREEK 
GET THE BOOK PAPOU 
HERE'S THAT BOOK I WAS TALKING ABOUT 
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNT YOU AND I 
I AM ALEXANDER THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTIETH MY RELATIVES WERE THE ANCIENT GREEKS 
YOUR RELATIVES LIVED TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
LET ME TELL YOU HOW LONG AGO THAT IS IT'S LIKE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PAPOUS 
ALL LIVING FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS EACH ONE AFTER THE OTHER HUH 
WHAT HAVE THE ANCIENT GREEKS GOT TO DO WITH ME GETTING TO SCHOOL ALIVE 
WHAT HAVE THEY TO DO WITH ANYTHING WHAT HAVE THE GREEKS GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT 
HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW TO GET TO SCHOOL 
GET OUT THE BOOK OF MAPS FROM YOUR BAG 
HOW DID WE DRIVE FROM SCOTLAND TO FRANCE LAST SUMMER 
WHEN WE COULD HAVE FLOWN MAPS THEY TELL US THE GEOGRAPHY OF A PLACE 
GEOGRAPHY WHERE THINGS ARE WHAT A PLACE LOOKS LIKE 
IS THERE A RIVER NEARBY YES YOU CAN SEE ON THE MAP 
IS THERE A SEA BETWEEN ENGLAND AND EURODISNEY YES 
MAPS SHOW US THE GEOGRAPHY 
AND WHO DO YOU THINK MADE UP THE WORD GEOGRAPHY 
LET ME GUESS THE GREEKS 
GEOGRAPHY COMES FROM TWO ANCIENT GREEK WORDS 
G. E. MEANING EARTH AND GRAPHE MEANING DRAWING 
AND THE GREEKS WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO DRAW MAPS OF THE WHOLE WORLD 
NOT THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS GREAT AT GEOGRAPHY 
A PHILOSOPHER CALLED XENOPHANES HAD SOME STRANGE IDEAS 
HE THOUGHT THAT THE WORLD WAS FLAT BECAUSE IT LOOKED FLAT 
WELL IT DOES HE ALSO THOUGHT THAT THE SUN DIDN'T SET 
IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE DISTANCE AND A NEW ONE REPLACED IT NEXT DAY 
YOU MEAN IT DOESN'T 
GEOGRAPHY 
AND THIS THIS IS A MAP OF ANCIENT GREECE 
IT WAS A VERY BIG PLACE YOU'D NEED TO DRIVE FOR DAYS AND DAYS 
AND GET FERRIES TO LOTS OF ISLANDS TO GET ALL THE WAY AROUND IT 
IT COVERED PARTS OF RUSSIA NORTH AFRICA ITALY TURKEY 
SO WHAT IT'S ANCIENT HISTORY AH 
THE WORD HISTORY WAS INVENTED BY THE GREEKS PAPOU YOU'RE OBSESSED 
YOU LIVE IN THE PAST 
IT'S NOT THE PAST THE ANCIENT GREEKS ARE ALL AROUND US 
IN ALMOST EVERYTHING WE DO 
DO SOMETHING FOR ME JUST THIS ONE THING 
BEFORE I EAT TOO MANY OLIVES AND BRANCHES GROW OUT OF MY EARS 
WHENEVER THOSE FOOLS LAUGH AT YOU 
I WANT YOU TO OPEN THE BOOK 
LOOK INSIDE AND THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU CAME FROM 
BETTER GO 
HEY POPPADOM POPPADOM 
I THOUGHT BACK TO WHAT PAPOU SAID THINGS WERE ABOUT TO GET WEIRD 
ATHENS 
THE PLACE WAS THE SAME BUT MY FRIENDS HAD BECOME ANCIENT GREEKS 
BUGSY SPIKE 
BUGSY WHO'S SPIKE 
WHERE HAVE THE GIRLS GONE 
THIS MUST BE A DREAM 
IT WAS STRANGE 
IT WAS VERY STRANGE AND THEN I SMELLED SOMETHING ODD 
CAN YOU GUYS SMELL PERFUME 
WHAT'S WRONG YOU DON'T LIKE MY PERFUME 
PAPOU WHERE AM I 
WHO'S PAPOU WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU YOU'RE VERY STRANGE 
AND HOW CAN YOU AFFORD THAT BOOK BOOKS COST A FORTUNE 
THIS IS JUST MY IMAGINATION 
TALKING TO YOURSELF THAT'S THE FIRST SIGN OF MADNESS 
TALKING TO A SLAVE THAT CLINCHES IT CUCKOO BANANAS 
YOU'RE A SLAVE 
STRANGE ISN'T IT ATHENS IS THE RICHEST CITY IN THE WORLD 
HAS A GREAT SEA HARBOUR A MAGNIFICENT NAVY OF STRONG ROWERS 
READY TO TRADE AND FIGHT FOR MONEY AND POWER YET MOST OF US ARE POOR 
MY PARENTS FARMED WHEAT WHEN THE CROP FAILED THEY HAD TO SELL ME 
I TOLD THEM TO GO IN FOR OLIVES BUT DID THEY LISTEN NO NO 
MY NEW OWNER HE SELLS OLIVE OIL ALL OVER NOW RICH AS KINGS HERE 
TRY ONE 
M. M. M. IF YOU'RE A SLAVE THEN WHO AM I 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE I'M NEW THEN I WILL TELL YOU 
YOU ARE AN ATHENIAN 
YOU LIVE IN THE GREAT CITY OF ATHENS 
WE HAVE A GREAT SEA HARBOUR 
A GREAT TEMPLE THE PARTHENON 
ON TOP OF A HILL WE CALL THE ACROPOLIS 
WE EVEN HAVE OUR OWN GREAT GODS 
POSEIDON WHO LOOKS AFTER THE SEA FOR US 
DON'T ANGER HIM HE'LL CAUSE THE EARTH TO SHAKE 
AND THEN THERE'S ATHENA OUR GODDESS OF WISDOM 
ATHENA ATHENS THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME 
ATHENS IS NAMED AFTER ATHENA NUMPTY 
BEFORE ATHENS WAS CALLED ATHENS 
ATHENA AND POSEIDON EACH WANTED THE CITY TO BE NAMED AFTER THEM 
THEY SQUABBLED SO MUCH 
THE OTHER GODS DECIDED THEY SHOULD EACH GET A GIFT FOR THE PEOPLE 
THE BEST GIFT WOULD DECIDE IT 
POSEIDON CHOSE A HORSE A HORSE 
YES USEFUL I SUPPOSE BUT WHEN ATHENA CHOSE AN OLIVE TREE 
NO CONTEST SHADE SOAP COOKING OIL TASTY OLIVES 
ATHENA WON HANDS DOWN 
SO I'M ATHENIAN WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN 
OH IT MEANS YOU'RE INTELLECTUAL WITTY AND UNUSUALLY POLITE 
OH RIGHT THANKS FOR THE OLIVE 
IT WA A MAGNIFICENT EXAMPLE OF THE LOCAL CUISINE AND TRULY DELECTABLE 
IS HE ATHENIAN 
NO HE'S FROM SPARTA ANOTHER PART OF GREECE 
SPARTA IS JUST ONE OF A LOT OF CITY STATES 
AND EVERY CITY STATE HAS DIFFERENT RULES AND DIFFERENT BOSSES 
AND BOY DO WE ALL FIGHT A LOT WITH EACH OTHER 
BUT WE ALL SPEAK GREEK AND WE ALL BELIEVE IN THE SAME GODS 
SO ARE ATHENIANS THE BEST AM I THE BEST 
YOU ARE THE BEST EDUCATED 
SO MY BOY YOU'D BETTER GET ALONG AND GET TO SCHOOL 
I HADN'T EVEN GOT TO SCHOOL 
AND I HAD ALREADY LEARNT ABOUT ATHENS SPARTA THE CITY STATES 
THEN I SAW A POSTER FOR A THEATRE SHOW 
SEE IF YOU CAN REMEMBER HOW MANY POMEGRANATE SEEDS PERSEPHONE ATE 
THE STORY WAS ABOUT THE KIDNAPPED BRIDE 
ABOUT HOW WINTER WAS CREATED 
WHEN DEMETER OR MOTHER NATURE LOST HER DAUGHTER TO HADES 
GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD

YOU'LL HAVE A BITE TO EAT WON'T YOU 
I'M NOT HUNGRY PLEASE LET ME GO WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME 
LOOK FOR HER TREES 
SEARCH FOR HER SUNLIGHT FIND MY LITTLE GIRL 
YOU COULD BE QUEEN OF ALL THIS YOU KNOW 
THE UNDERWORLD IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE UPPER WORLD 
THERE ARE MORE SOULS DOWN HERE THAN THERE ARE UP THERE 
GHOSTS YOU MEAN OH SUNLIGHT HOW I MISS YOU 
PLEASE TELL MY MOTHER WHERE I AM 
DEMETER 
THIS IS THE VOICE OF THE SUN 
YOUR DAUGHTER IS IN HADES 
HADES HAS STOLEN HER AWAY FOR A BRIDE 
PLEASE

DEMETER LET US TRY TO SEE BOTH SIDES OF THIS 
HADES DESERVES A LITTLE HAPPINESS DOESN'T HE 
STOP DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT 
IF YOU DON'T MAKE HADES GIVE ME BACK MY DAUGHTER HERE AND NOW 
I'LL LET THE WHOLE WORLD GO HANG 
DO YOU SERIOUSLY IMAGINE I COULD GIVE MY MIND TO DRESSING THE TREES 
OR RIPENING THE GRAIN OR COLOURING THE FLOWERS 
KNOWING THAT MY LITTLE PERSEPHONE WAS DOWN THERE 
OH NOW SISTER YOU DON'T MEAN THAT 
TRY ME 
HOW LONG WILL YOUR WORSHIPPERS GO ON GLORIFYING YOU ZEUS 
WHEN THEIR VINES ARE SHRIVELLING 
AND THE TREES ARE BARE AND THE GRASS STAYS UNDERGROUND 
I THINK YOU'RE BEING HYSTERICAL DEMETER 
BUT IF IT MATTERS SO MUCH TO YOU 
HERMES HERMES I SAY COME 
I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU TO CARRY DOWN BELOW

DEMETER SHALL HAVE HER DAUGHTER BACK 
BUT FOR ONE HALF OF THE YEAR 
I CANNOT LET DEMETER GRIEVE AT THE WORLD'S EXPENSE 
AND ME 
I WHO NEVER GET TO WALK WAIST DEEP THROUGH FIELDS OF CORN 
OR WALLOW IN THE SEA ON A HOT DAY 
I CLOSE MY EYES IN DARKNESS AND WAKE UP IN THE SAME DARKNESS 
AREN'T I TO HAVE MY OWN SLIVER OF BEAUTY 
BUT BECAUSE SHE ATE HALF THE SEEDS FROM THE PLATE 
FOR THE OTHER HALF OF THE YEAR SHE WILL LIVE WITH HER HUSBAND 
YES 
O. OH DO YOU CALL THAT JUSTICE 
MORE THAN MOST MOTHERS CAN HOPE FOR 
SURELY AFTER THEIR DAUGHTERS ARE MARRIED BE CONTENT
