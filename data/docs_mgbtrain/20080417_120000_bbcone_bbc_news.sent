MARK SIMPSON THERE LET'S GET MORE 
FROM FIONA TROTT WHO WAS IN COURT 
TODAY FIONA TELL US MORE ABOUT 
WHO WAS THERE AND SOME OF THE 
SCENES INSIDE THE COURT THIS 
MORNING MORNING I CAN TELL YOU THAT BOTH RHYS 
JONES' PARENTS WERE HERE IN COURT 
TWO WHICH WAS SITTING AS A YOUTH 
COURT AT LIVERPOOL MAGISTRATES' 
COURT THIS MORNING THEY WERE THERE 
LISTENING TO THE PROCEEDINGS FOR A 
WHOLE HOUR SITTING JUST METRES 
AWAY FROM THE WOMAN WHOSE OWN SON 
IS ACCUSED OF MURDERING RHYS IN 
AUGUST LAST YEAR NOW WHEN THAT 
CHARGE WAS READ OUT TO THE SEVENTEEN YEAR 
OLD RHYS'S MOTHER MELANIE STARTED 
TO CRY OCCASIONALLY THROUGHOUT 
THIS MORNING'S PROCEEDINGS SHE 
ALSO SHOOK HER HEAD IN DISBELIEF 
BOTH HER AND HER HUSBAND WERE 
WEARING THE PURPLE RIBBON WHICH HAS 
BEEN KNOWN TO REPRESENT RHYS'S 
MEMORY BUT ALSO THE CAMPAIGN TO 
GET GUNS OFF THE STREETS 
WHAT THE JUDGE ALSO TOLD ALL FOUR 
YOUTHS THIS MORNING WAS THAT THESE 
CASES FOR EACH OF THE DEFENDANTS 
ARE A SERIOUS MATTER HE WOULD 
EXPLAIN THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO 
CROWN COURT IN DUE COURSE AND THEY 
WOULD BE REMANDED IN CUSTODY UNTIL 
TWENTY FIFTH APRIL 
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED CONSTRUCTION 
COMPANIES HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF 
PRICE FIXING FOLLOWING ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST EVER INVESTIGATIONS BY THE 
OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING THE OFT 
SAYS THE FIRMS COLLUDED WHEN 
BIDDING FOR CONTRACTS TO BUILD 
HOSPITALS SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES 
THE WATCHDOG SAID CONTRACTS WORTH 
MORE THAN ONE BILLION COULD HAVE 
BEEN AFFECTED JOHN MOYLAN REPORTS 
AS ONE OF THE U. K.'S BIGGEST 
INDUSTRIES IT GENERATES MORE THAN 
ONE HUNDRED BILLION WORTH OF BUSINESS 
EVERY YEAR TODAY THE CONSTRUCTION 
WORLD IS AT THE CENTRE OF 
ALLEGATIONS OF FINANCIAL 
IMPROPRIETY AND HIDDEN PAYMENTS 
PROJECTS INVOLVED INCLUDE NEW 
SCHOOLS UNIVERSITIES AND HOSPITALS 
MEANING THE TAXPAYER HAS BEEN 
FOOTING THE BILL 
AND THE ALLEGATIONS INVOLVE SOME OF 
THE BIGGEST NAMES IN THE BUSINESS 
ONE HUNDRED TWELVE COMPANIES IN TOTAL ALL FACE 
CHARGES OF INVOLVEMENT IN BID 
RIGGING ACTIVITIES AND COLLUDING TO 
DECIDE WHICH WOULD WIN EACH 
CONTRACT CONTRACT PARTIES ARE TENDERING FOR CONTRACTS 
AND THEY SHOULD BE DECIDING 
INDEPENDENTLY OF EACH OTHER WHAT 
KIND OF PRICE THEY PUT IN FOR THAT 
CONTRACT WHAT IS THEIR BID 
INSTEAD WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IS 
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN GETTING 
TOGETHER SOMETIMES ONE ON ONE 
SOMETIMES MORE THAN THAT TO DECIDE 
AMONGST THEMSELVES WHAT PRICE WILL 
BE PUT IN AND TO SIGNAL TO EACH 
OTHER WHAT THEIR INTENTIONS WITH 
REGARD TO THE CONTRACT ACTUALLY ARE 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE 
REDEVELOPMENT OF BIRMINGHAM'S BULL 
RING A CASE WHICH IS NOW OVER 
FOUR FIRMS TENDERED TO INSTALL THE 
ROOFING SYSTEM BUT TWO BID 
ARTIFICIALLY HIGH SOME RECEIVED 
HIDDEN COMPENSATION PAYMENTS ALL 
FOUR COMPANIES HAD COLLUDED SHARING 
DETAILS OF THE BIDS THEY PLANNED TO 
MAKE THE COMPETITION AUTHORITIES 
SAY THEY HAVE EVIDENCE OF POTENTIAL 
WRONG DOING INVOLVING THOUSANDS OF 
TENDERS FOR WORK WHICH COULD 
AMOUNT TO BILLIONS OF POUNDS THEY 
SAY THAT FORTY FIRMS HAVE ALREADY 
ADMITTED BEING INVOLVED IN SOME 
FORM OF BID RIGGING ACTIVITIES 
THE INDUSTRY ACCEPTS FIRMS DO 
SUBMIT HIGH BIDS TO AVOID BEING 
AWARDED WORK BUT IT DENIES THIS 
INCREASES COSTS TO TAXPAYERS 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES HERE 
COMPANIES WILL SIMPLY NOT PUT IN A 
COVER IN SIMPLY NOT TO GET THE JOB 
BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO BUSY THEY 
WANTED TO DO IT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY 
DIDN'T WANT TO OFFEND THE CLIENT 
IT'S A PRACTICE THAT VERY MUCH HAS 
BEEN ELIMINATED FROM THE INDUSTRY 
BECAUSE IT ONLY WORKED WHEN YOU GOT 
A TENDER LANDING ON YOUR DESK AND 
IT WAS AL SURPRISE AND YOU WERE 
BIDDING ON THE LOWEST PRICE 
THE COMPANIES WILL NOW HAVE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THE 
ALLEGATIONS THOSE FOUND TO HAVE 
INFRINGED COMPETITION LAW COULD 
FACE SUBSTANTIAL FINES 
THE HEAD OF THE U. K.'S BIGGEST EXAM 
BOARD HAS WARNED THE GOVERNMENT 
THAT ITS NEW DIPLOMA QUALIFICATION 
RISKS FAILURE WHEN IT'S LAUNCHED IN 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND IN 
SEPTEMBER JERRY JAR SIS FROM 
EDEXCEL SAYS TEACHERS ARE NOT 
GETTING ENOUGH TRAINING IN HOW TO 
TEACH THE DIPLOMA AND SOME PUPILS 
MAY FIND IT TOO DEMANDING ANDREW 
BOMFORD HAS MORE DETAILS 
THESE STUDENTS ARE PART OF WHAT IS 
BEING CALLED THE WORLD'S BIGGEST 
REFORM OF EXAMS IN SEPTEMBER 
THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND START OUT ON A DIPLOMA AIMED 
AT BRIDGING THE DIVIDE BETWEEN 
ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL SUBJECTS 
CRITICS SAY THE PREPARATIONS ARE IN 
DISARRAY SOME STUDENTS THINK IT'S 
A BIG RISK 
IT'S NOT EXPERIMENTED 
IT'S THE FIRST YEAR SO I DIDN'T 
WANT TO GO INTO IT 
IN THE DIPLOMA 
IT CONTAINS CONSTRUCTION WRICK 
LAYING AND STUFF LIKE THAT THAT IS 
WHAT I WANT DO WHEN I GET OLDER AT AT THE BIGGEST EXAM BOARD THERE'S 
CONCERN THAT TEACHERS HAVE NOT HAD 
ENOUGH TRAINING SCHOOLS ARE NOT 
READY AND PUPILS MIGHT FAIL BECAUSE 
THE DIPLOMAS COULD BE TOO DEMANDING 
EDEXCEL SAYS IT'S TOTALLY COMMITTED 
TO DIPLOMAS AND IS DETERMINED TO 
MAKE THEM WORK BUT JERRY JARVIS OF 
EDEXCEL TOLD THE GUARDIAN 
BUT SOME HEAD TEACHERS SAY THEY ARE 
READY READY SOME CHILDREN WHO WOULD BE SUITED 
BY ANOTHER QUALIFICATION FOR WHOM A 
COURSE WHICH IS MORE PRACTICALLY 
BASED WHICH IS MORE VOCATIONALLY 
ORIENTATED IS A BETTER 
QUALIFICATION THAN THE RANGE OF 
TRADITIONAL GCSES 
AFTER THE FIRST STUDENTS START IN 
SEPTEMBER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
MORE WILL FOLLOW IN YEARS TO COME 
TEACHERS SAY IT'S VITAL THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT GETS IT RIGHT MINISTERS 
TODAY DISMISSED THE CRITICISM AS 
ABSOLUTE NONSENSE AND SAID THE 
DIPLOMA IS GOING FROM STRENGTH TO 
STRENGTH STRENGTH JOHN DUPED FOR IS THE GENERAL 
SECRETARY OF THE ASSOCIATION OF 
SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LEADERS HE 
JOINS US FROM OUR NEWSROOM IN 
LEICESTER JOHN DUNFORD IF I WAS A 
STUDENT OR A PARENT OF A STUDENT 
LISTENING TO THAT LIST OF 
CRITICISMS I THINK I'D BE PRETTY 
CONCERNED ARE THEY RIGHT TO BE 
WORRIED DO YOU THINK 
I THINK IT'S 
DOING A DISSERVICE TO THE SCHOOLS 
AND COLLEGES THAT ARE PREPARING TO 
TEACH THE DIPLOMA IN SEPTEMBER TO 
SUGGEST THAT THEY MIGHT BE GOING 
INTO GET INTO SOMETHING THAT IS 
WORTHLESS FOR THEIR STUDENTS THE 
SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WON'T DO THAT 
WHAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO SAY IS 
THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT READY 
YESTERDAY IET WHICH SIX MONTHS TO 
GO WE DO NEED SOME MORE TRAINING 
FOR THE TEACHERS WHO ARE GOING TO 
DO IT WE NEED SOME MORE 
INFORMATION ABOUT CERTAIN ASPECTS 
OF THE COURSES BUT THE HEADS OF 
THE SCHOOLS AND THE PRINCIPALS OF 
THE COLLEGES ARE CLEAR THAT THEY IS 
A QUALIFICATION THAT HAS GOT A 
PLACE IN OUR QUALIFICATIONS 
STRUCTURE THAT WILL EVENTUALLY BE A 
GOOD QUALIFICATION FOR FOURTEEN TO NINETEEN 
YEAR OLDS AND THAT WILL BE WELL 
RECOGNISED BY EMPLOYERS AND HIGHER 
EDUCATION OF COURSE THERE IS A 
LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE WE GET THERE 
INDEED THE NUMBERS STARTING IN THE 
FIRST YEAR WE HAVE AGREED WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE KEPT 
DELIBERATELY LOW SO THAT WE CAN 
IRON OUT ANY PROBLEMS THAT COME 
EARLY ON AS THOSE NUMBERS 
INCREASE I'M CONFIDENT THIS IS 
GOING TO BE A QUALIFICATION THAT IS 
GOING TO BE WIDELY RECOGNISED YOU YOU SAY THAT POINT WILL BE REACHED 
EVENTUALLY ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY 
CONFIDENT COULD YOU REASSURE A 
PARENT THAT NO SCHOOL WOULD START 
OFFERING IT IF ITS TEACHERS WERE 
NOT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT HAPPY THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY 
AU FAIT WITH ALL OF IT 
I CAN 
ABSOLUTELY ASSURE PARENTS THAT THE 
RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF SCHOOLS 
AND COLLEGES THAT ARE EMBARKING ON 
THE PIONEERING OF THIS DIPLOMA THIS 
SEPTEMBER ARE ALL EXPERIENCED IN 
THIS AREA HAVE ALL HAD TO GO 
THROUGH A VERY DETAILED GATEWAY IN 
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BE ALLOWED TO 
OFFER THIS PROGRAMME THEY'RE 
ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO IT THEY 
ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T 
FAIL AND THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE 
SURE THAT TWO YEARS LATER THESE 
YOUNGSTERS HAVE A PIECE OF PAP 
THEY'RE IS WORTH WHILE AND REALLY 
WELL RECOGNISED 
JOHN DUNFORD MANY 
THANKS THANKS THE OLYMPIC FLAME HAS RUN INTO MORE 
PRO TIBET 
IN THE INDIAN 
CAPITAL DELHI ON LATEST LEG OF 
ITS CONTROVERSIAL WORLDWIDE RELAY 
BEFORE THE BEIJING GAMES 
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT SO FAR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
PROTESTORS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED 
THE TORCH'S ORIGINAL ROUTE WAS TO 
GO TO THE RED FORT TO INDIA GATE A 
JOURNEY OF ABOUT FIVE MILES THAT 
HAS BEEN CUT TO A THIRD OF THAT 
DISTANCE FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL 
PALACE TO INDIA GATE SANJOY 
MAJUMDER REPORTS FROM DELHI 
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT 
TORCH VERY QUICKLY 
THIS WAS ALWAYS GOING BE ONE OF THE 
MOST SENSITIVE LEGS OF THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH RALLY AS IT MADE ITS WAY 
DOWN A SHORT STRETCH IN THE HEART 
OF DELHI CARRIED BY INDIA'S SPORTS 
STARS AND BOLLYWOOD STARS 
UNPRECEDENTED SECURITY WAS IN PLACE 
AND THIS IS WHY JUST A SHORT 
DISTANCE AWAY TIBETAN ACTIVISTS 
TAKING PART IN AN ALTERNATIVE RALLY 
TO PROTEST AGAINST CHINA SIMILAR 
DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING 
PLACE ACROSS THE COUNTRY DANE 
WHICH IS HOME TO THE DALAI LAMA 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN SYMPATHETIC TO 
THEIR CAUSE BUT NOW SOME YOUNGER 
TIBETANS FEEL LET DOWN 
WE WANT YOU TO BE BRAVE AND 
BUT INDIA HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE 
FROM CHINA TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING 
COMES IN THE WAY OF A SUCCESSFUL 
RALLY SO IT DEPLAYED ITS ELITE 
UNITS TO ENSURE A SMOOTH PASSAGE 
EVEN IF IT MEANT THAT ORDINARY 
INDIANS WERE KEPT OUT AS WELL 
LET'S GET THE LATEST FROM SANJOY 
YOU ARE AT THE END OF THE ROUTE IT 
LOOKS PRETTY QUIET THERE NOW HOW 
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE MOOD AND 
ATMOSPHERE THERE 
IT'S PRETTY QUIET 
NOW I CAN TELL YOU IT WAS VERY 
QUIET EVEN WHEN THE RALLY WAS 
TAKING PLACE THE ONLY PEOPLE ON 
HAND TO WITNESS IT WERE A LARGE 
GROUP OF MEDIA PERSONS AND SEVERAL 
SECURITY PERSONNEL AT THE FAR END 
BEHIND ME YOU CAN SEE WHERE INDIA 
GATE THAT IS WHERE THE TORCH RALLY 
ENDED THE SHORTENED MILE AND A 
HALF ROUTE OF THIS RALLY IN DELHI 
MAINLY BECAUSE OF FIERCES THAT 
TIBETAN PROTESTORS WERE GOING TO 
STORM THIS LEG OF THE RALLY THE 
PROTESTS DID TAKE PLACE ELSEWHERE 
IN MANY PARTS OF INDIA AND TOOK 
PLACE A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM WHERE 
I AM WHERE A LARGE NUMBER OF 
TIBETANS STARTED A ALTERNATIVE 
RALLY AND THEN SOME OF THE YOUNGER 
MORE RADICAL MEMBERS OF THE TIBETAN 
GROUPS TRIED TO STORM THE RALLY AT 
SEVERAL PLACES THEY TRIED TO BREAK 
THROUGH BUT THEY WERE KEPT WELL 
AWAY BY POLICE ON THE WHOLE A 
SUCCESSFUL IF QUIET RALLY HERE IN 
DELHI DELHI MORE THAN THIRTY PEOPLE HAVE DIED AFTER 
A SUICIDE BOMBER STRUCK AT A 
FUNERAL IN IRAQ THE ATTACKER BLEW 
HIMSELF UP IN A CROWD OF MOURNERS 
IN A TOWN NINETY MILES NORTH OF BAGHDAD 
THERE ARE FEARS THAT AL QAEDA 
MILITANTS ARE REORGANISING IN THE 
WAKE OF THE SECURITY SURGE 
IN GAZA THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS 
INCLUDING JOURNALISTS AND MEMBERS 
OF RIVAL POLITICAL GROUPS HAVE 
MARCHED THROUGH THE STREETS IN A 
FUNERAL PROCESSION FOR FADAL SHANA 
A CAMERAMAN THAT WAS KILLED IN A 
STRIKE ON THE GAZA STRIP YESTERDAY 
TWENTY OTHER PEOPLE DIED INCLUDING 
ISRAELI SOLDIERS PALESTINIAN 
CIVILIANS AND MILITANTS 
THERE WAS ANOTHER WAR OF WORDS LAST 
NIGHT IN THE RACE FOR THE U. S. 
PRESIDENCY WHILE THE REPUBLICANS 
PICKED THEIR CANDIDATE MORE THAN A 
MONTH AIRCRAFT THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
STILL BATTLING IT OUT THE PARTY'S 
TWO CANDIDATES SENATORS HILLARY 
CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA SQUARED UP 
IN ANOTHER TELEVISED DEBATE IN 
ADVANCE OF NEXT WEEK'S IMPORTANT 
PENNSYLVANIA PRIMARY 
THE BATTLE CRIES IN THE INTENSE 
RIVALRY BEGAN EVEN BEFORE THE TWO 
CANDIDATES TOOK TO THE STAGE IT 
HAS BEEN SIX WEEKS SINCE THEY LAST 
WENT HEAD TO HEAD BUT DESPITE THE 
INITIAL SMILES THE TONE HAS BECOME 
INCREASINGLY HARSH BARACK OBAMA 
WAS SOON FORCED ONTO THE DEFENSIVE 
HAVING TO EXPLAIN EARLIER COMMENTS 
WHERE HE HAD DESCRIBED SOME 
PENNSYLVANIA VOTERS AS BITTER L. 
CAN SEE HOW PEOPLE WERE OFFENDED 
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE 
MADE A STATEMENT THAT WAS MANGLED 
UP IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE LAST 
I CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE WOULD BE TAKEN 
ABACK AND OFFENDED BY THE REMARKS 
AND I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS 
THAT WE ALL LISTEN TO ONE ANOTHER 
AND WE RESPECT ONE ANOTHER 
AND THEN THERE WERE THE IN FROM A 
TREE COMMENTS OF THE REVEREND 
JEREMIAH RIGHT BARACK OBAMA'S 
FORMER PASTOR WHO HAD SUGGESTED 
THAT AMERICA WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THE ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH 
THESE COMMENTS WERE OBJECTIONABLE 
THEY ARE NOT COMMENTS THAT I 
BELIEVE IN AND I. D. C. ASSOCIATED 
MYSELF FROM THEM 
BUT HILLARY CLINTON ALSO HAD TO GO 
FRONT QUESTIONS REGARDING HER OWN 
CREDIBILITY CREDIBILITY HER DRAMATIC ACCOUNT OF A TRIP TO 
BOSNIA INCLUDED CLAIMS THAT SHE HAD 
LANDED UNDER SNIPER FIRE THE VIDEO 
EVIDENCE PROVED OTHERWISE L. AM 
EMBARRASSED BY IT ARE I HAVE 
APOLOGISED FOR IT I HAVE SAID IT 
WAS A MISTAKE 
AND IT IS I HOPE SOMETHING THAT YOU 
CAN LOOK OVER HILLARY CLINTON 
HAS THE EDGE IN THE PENNSYLVANIA 
PRIMARY STILL HAS THE EDGE 
BARACK OBAMA REMAINS THE FRONT 
RUNNER NATIONALLY BUT THIS WAS HIS 
LEAST CONVINCING PERFORMANCE ONCE 
AGAIN HERE IN PHILADELPHIA 
WHATEVER THE SPIN DOCTORS SAY 
THERE WAS NO CLEAR WINNER NO 
DECISIVE MOMENT IN JUST UNDER 
WEEK'S TIME THE PEOPLE OF 
PENNSYLVANIA WILL HAVE THEIR SAY 
BUT EVEN THAT IS UNLIKELY TO DECIDE 
THE UTCOME OF THIS DEMOCRATIC CONTEST 
THE TOP STORIES A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD HAS 
APPEARED IN COURT IN LIVERPOOL 
CHARGED WITH MURDERING RHYS JONES 
RHYS'S PARENTS WERE IN COURT TO SEE 
THE TEENAGER REMANDED IN CUSTODY 
AM IN SOUTH WALES WHERE TWO OF 
BRITAIN'S BRIGHTEST SWIMMING STARS 
AGED JUST FIVE AND SEVEN ARE 
PRACTISING ON B. B. C. LONDON SCHOOLS 
FACING TEACHER SHORTAGES AFTER 
GOVERNMENT CRACKDOWNS ON EMPLOYING 
FOREIGN STAFF AND LAST CHANCE FOR 
CHELSEA AVRAM GRANT'S TEAM FACE 
EVERTON TONIGHT 
NOW COULD THESE BE THE ANSWER TO 
SOARING OIL PRICES AND GREENHOUSE 
GASES THEY ARE HYDROGEN MOLECULES 
AND SOME SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THEY 
COULD BE USED TO FUEL THE CARS OF 
THE FUTURE THIS MORNING TEAM 
FROM BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY UNVEILED 
ENGLAND'S ONLY HYDROGEN GAS FILLING 
STATION OUR CORRESPONDENT WAS AT 
THE LAUNCH IT LOOKS JUST LIKE A A 
TRADITIONAL FUEL PUMP BUT COMING 
OUT OF THIS NOZZLE IS HYDROGEN GAS 
SO COULD WE BE SEEING THE IS ON 
EVERY GARAGE FORECOURT 
THAT IS WHAT THE TEAM HERE AIMS TO 
FIND OUT 
RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON 
HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY SINCE 
THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES THE KEY IS 
COMBINING HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN 
EFFECTIVELY WE HAVE GOT THE OXYGEN 
HERE AT THE HIGH DUDGEON HERE 
SEPARATED BY THIS MEMBRANE 
WHEN THE TWO GASES ARE MIXED YOU 
GET ELECTRICITY FORMED AS WELL AS 
WATER THE ONLY EMISSION FROM THE 
IS CO IS WATER OTHER THAN THAT IT 
IS LIKE DRIVING A STANDARD 
AUTOMATIC AUTOMATIC THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS WHEN YOU COME 
TO FUEL UP THE HYDROGEN IS PUMPED 
IN FROM PRESSURISED CONTAINERS 
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS IT 
WILL BE USED TO POWER FLEET OF 
VEHICLES AROUND CAMPUS SOME OF 
THEM WILL BE DOING THINGS LIKE POST 
OR DUTIES FUEL DELIVERY DOING DOING THIS WE WILL BE TESTING THE 
COMPONENTS AND THE RELIABILITY AND 
A LIFETIME AT THE END OF IT WE 
HOPE TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THIS 
CAN BE COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET 
BUT THE WAY MOST HUNDRED AND IS 
CURRENTLY PRODUCED DOES QUESTION 
ITS GREEN CREDENTIALS 
IT IS NOT GREEN AT THE MOMENT 
BECAUSE WE ARE PRODUCING IT FROM 
FOSSIL FUELS WHICH HAS CUPBOARD 
IMPLICATION AND UNTIL THAT HAS 
BEEN OVERCOME AND UNTIL WE HAVE 
GOT A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM THEN WE 
ARE LOOKING REALISTICALLY AT 
POSSIBLY TWENTY YEARS BEFORE IT IS A 
ECONOMICALLY AVAILABLE TO THE 
POPULATION AT LARGE RESEARCH RESEARCH PROJECTS LIKE THIS ONE IN 
BIRMINGHAM ARE HOPING TO PROVE THAT 
HYDROGEN CAN BE A VIABLE FUEL FOR 
THE FUTURE MORE FILLING STATION 
LIKE THIS ONE ARE PLANNED IN THE U. K. 
BUT THERE IS CLEARLY A LONG WAY TO 
GO BEFORE THIS CAN REPLACE 
TRADITIONAL FUELS 
DRINKING SMOKING AND EATING THE 
WRONG FOOD COULD ALL SPEED UP THE 
ONSET OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
ACCORDING TO NEW RESEARCH 
RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE MORE THAN TWO ALCOHOLIC 
DRINKS A DAY DEVELOP THE DISEASE 
FIVE YEARS EARLIER THAN THOSE WHO 
DRINK IN MODERATION A SECOND STUDY 
FOUND THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIGH 
CHOLESTEROL LEVELS IN THE FORTIES WERE 
ONE POINT FIVE TIMES MORE 
LIKELY TO DEVELOP 
ONE POINT FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP THE DISEASE LATER IN LIFE THAN 
PEOPLE WITH LOW CHOLESTEROL 
AND THERE ARE MANY STATISTICS ABOUT 
SMOKING AS WELL LET'S SPEAK TO THE 
HEAD OF RESEARCH AT THE ALZHEIMER'S 
SOCIETY I GUESS THIS IS TELLING US 
THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE CAN 
DO TO HELP HERE YES ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE STARTS MANY YEARS BEFORE 
THE SYMPTOMS APPEAR AND MORE AND 
MORE RESEARCH IS PRODUCING THE DATA 
WHICH SAYS THAT WHAT WE DO IN OUR 
FORTIES AND FIFTIES MATTERS FOR HOW EARLY 
WE ARE LIKELY TO DEVELOP 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
SO THAT IS 
SOME STEP BECAUSE WE ARE A LONG WAY 
FROM GETTING ANY CURE LET'S TALK 
ABOUT SMOKING BECAUSE THERE ARE 
SOME INTERESTING STATISTICS ABOUT 
SMOKING AS WELL 
BY ITS THIS IS 
THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN DATA 
THAT CLEARLY TELLS US THAT SMOKING 
ALSO INCREASES THE RISK OF 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WE HAVE NOT 
SEEN THAT BEFORE PROBABLY BECAUSE 
PEOPLE TENDED TO DIE OF SMOKING 
RELATED DISEASES BEFORE THEY GOT TO 
THE POINT OF GETTING ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE IN TERMS OF DRINKING THIS 
SUBJECT COMES UNDER DISCUSSION 
ACROSS SO MANY AREAS OF SOCIETY DO 
YOU THINK PEOPLE MIGHT THINK TWO 
DRINKS A DAY IS NOT VERY MUCH AND 
THEY MIGHT NOT TRY VERY HARD TO DO 
MUCH ABOUT IT 
I THINK IT IS A 
MIXED MESSAGE IN THE U. K. 
IN AMERICA 
THEY MAY THINK THAT TWO DRINKS A 
DAY CONSTITUTES HEAVY DRINKING WE 
HAVE HAD OTHER MESSAGES IN THE PAST 
WHICH HAVE SAID UP TO THREE DRINKS 
A DAY WAS FINE AT LEAST IF IT WAS 
RED WINE SO I THINK IT IS A 
GENERAL MESSAGE OF DRINKING IN 
MODERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER DAVID 
CAMERON HAS LAUNCHED HIS PARTY 
LOCAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN PROMISING 
TO CRACK DOWN ON COUNCIL TAX BILLS 
AND ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR ABOUT 
FOUR THOUSAND SEATS ARE UP FOR GRABS ON THE 
FIRST MAY IN LOCAL ELECTIONS REETA 
CHAKRABARTI IS IN DEWSBURY WITH 
MORE THANK YOU DAVE CAMERON 
NEEDS TO SHOW THAT HE CAN WIN 
CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
COUNTRY AND NOT JUST IN THE SOUTH 
OF ENGLAND 
THAT'S ONE KEY REASON PERHAPS WHY 
HE HAS CHOSEN TO LAUNCH HIS LOCAL 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN HERE IN YORKSHIRE 
A POLITICIAN CUDDLING A BABY IT 
MUST BE ELECTION TIME JUST BEFORE 
THE LAUNCH DAVID CAMERON DROPPED 
IN FOR BREAKFAST WITH SANDRA JAMES 
AND THEIR TWO CHILDREN 
ARE YOU ON 
GAS HERE THEY HAVE HAD THEIR 
LOFT INSULATED BY THE TORY RUN 
COUNCIL AT NO COST TO THEMSELVES 
THE TORIES SAY THIS IS AN EXAMPLE 
OF THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
DAVID CAMERON HAS BEEN ENVIRONMENT WALKING TOUR RECENTLY GOVERNMENT 
DIFFICULTIES AND THE TORIES' HIGH 
STANDING IN THE POLLS HAVE GIVEN 
HIM CONFIDENCE HE IS STICKING TO 
THE PARTY'S OLD SLOGAN ON THE 
ENVIRONMENT OUR MESSAGE IN THIS 
LOCAL IN ACTION IS SO SIMPLE VOTE 
BLUE GO GREEN AND SAVE MONEY 
BUT AWARE THAT GREEN IS STILL SEEN 
AS FRINGE ISSUE BY SOME MR. 
CAMERON WAS KEEN TO LINK IT TO MORE 
PRACTICAL MATTERS CLEAN STREETS 
ARE SAFE STREET GET RID OF THE 
GRAFFITI YOU HOPE TO GET RID OF 
THE HOOLIGANS 
PEOPLE REALLY CARE 
IT IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE ABOUT 
SAFETY AND CRIME AND VANDALISM ON 
THE STREETS COUNCILS CAN HELP WITH 
THIS BY PROVIDING CLEAN AND GREEN 
AND SAFE NEIGHBOURHOODS DEWSBURY 
IS PART OF TORY RUN KIRKLEES 
COUNCIL BUT THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
IS STILL A POLITICAL CHALLENGE FOR 
THE TORIES WHO HAVE NO COUNCILLORS 
IN SOME OF THE BIG CITIES THEY 
KNOW THAT THEY HAVE GOT TO MAKE 
INROADS I WANT US TO GAIN SEATS 
AND COUNCIL I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE 
CAN DO THAT BUT I NEVER MAKE 
PREDICTIONS 
BUT WE DO START FROM A PREDICTIONS POSITION OF HAVING MANY MORE 
COUNCILLORS THAN LABOUR AND THE 
LIBERALS COMBINED THAT MAY BE TRUE 
BUT DAVID CAMERON KNOWS HE NEEDS A 
MUCH BIGGER SPREAD OF COUNCILLORS 
ACROSS THE NORTH TO REALLY CLAIM 
THAT THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IS 
CHANGING 
NOW THERE ARE FEWER CHANGING COUNCIL SEATS UP FOR GRABS THIS 
YEAR THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND 
THAT PROBABLY MEANS THAT THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE LESS CHANCE TO 
PULL OFF ANY SPECTACULAR GAINS 
BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS THEY WILL BE 
HOPING TO PERSUADE PEOPLE THAT THE 
POLITICAL MOMENTUM REMAINS WITH 
THEM THEM OR SO THE U. K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY 
HAS LAUNCHED ITS MANIFESTO FOR THE 
LONDON MAYORAL ELECTION ALSO 
ITS CANDIDATE GERARD BATTEN SAID 
THAT IF HE BECAME MAYOR HE WOULD 
USE THE POSITION TO TALK ABOUT THE 
PARTY'S POLICIES ON IMMIGRATION WE 
WOULD HAVE AN IMMEDIATE FREEZE A ON 
IMMIGRATION UNTIL WE SORT OUT THE 
BORDERS 
WE WOULD NOT STOP PEOPLE BORDERS COMING HERE TO WORK BUT IT WOULD 
BE ON A WORK PERMIT BASIS ONLY WE 
WOULD THEN INTRODUCE STRICT 
CONTROLS FOR ANY FUTURE IMMIGRATION 
SO THAT PEOPLE COULD ONLY COME IN 
WHEN WHAT THEY WERE THE KIND OF 
PEOPLE WE WANTED AND THERE IS A 
FULL LIST OF EVERY ONE WHO IS 
RUNNING IN THE LONDON MAYORAL RACE 
ON OUR WEBSITE 
NOW TWO YOUNG SISTERS WHO ARE 
TIPPED AS FUTURE OLYMPIANS ARE 
CAUSING QUITE A SPLASH IN SOUTH 
WALES GEORGETTE EVANS WHO IS JUST 
FIVE AND HER SEVEN YEAR OLD SISTER 
HAVE BEEN NOTCHING UP LONG DISTANCE 
SWIMMING RECORDS EVER SINCE DAD 
POPPED THEM INTO A POOL AT JUST 
FEW MONTHS OLD WYRE DAVIES HAS 
JOINED THEM POOLSIDE PLENTY OF 
FOCUS ALREADY IN THE PROGRAMME ON 
THE BEIJING OLYMPICS BUT TWO 
YOUNGSTERS WITH THEIR EYES FIRMLY 
SET ON OLYMPICS AHEAD ARE THESE TWO 
AS YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE LONG 
DISTANCE EXPERTS THEY HAVE JUST 
BECOME THE TWO YOUNGEST PEOPLE IN 
BRITAIN TO ACHIEVE THEIR LONG 
DISTANCE AWARDS THE MAN 
RESPONSIBLE IS THEIR FATHER AND HE 
JOINS ME NOW HOW DID YOU KNOW THEY 
HAD A SPECIAL TALENT 
THEY COME 
HERE REGULARLY ABOUT FOUR TIMES A 
WEEK SO I COULD SEE IT IN THEM 
THEY ARE VERY YOUNG GIRLS NOW DO 
YOU WORRY THAT YOU PUSH THEM TOO 
MUCH SOMETIMES AS A PARENT 
DO YOU 
WORRY THAT BEING SO YOUNG THEY 
SWIM A BIT TOO MUCH PERHAPS NO 
WE HAVE A LIFE GUARD SWIMMING WITH 
THEM AND I SWIM WITH THEM AS WELL 
JUST TO CHECK STRESS LEVELS AND 
EVERYTHING IS SOUND 
YOU HOPE THEY 
WILL BE OLYMPIC STARS ONE DAY 
HOPEFULLY LET'S HAVE A QUICK WORD 
WITH THE GIRL SO 
WITH THE GIRLS 
ARE YOU AN OLYMPIC HOPEFUL DO YOU 
HAVE A CHANCE OF GOING TO THE 
OLYMPICS ONE DAY L. L. DON'T KNOW IT DEPENDS 
IF MY FATHER LETS ME DO DEPENDS YOU THINK YOU ARE PERHAPS SWIMMING 
A BIT TOO MUCH 
OR WOULD YOU LIKE 
TO SWIM A LOT MORE A LOT MORE HOW 
DIFFICULT WAS IT TO SWIM THREE 
KILOMETRES WAS IT HARD L. KNOW SHE 
WANTS TO BE IN THE OLYMPIC ONE DAY 
THE PROBLEM FOR THESE TWO IS THAT 
THEY ARE SO YOUNG THEY WON'T EVEN 
QUALIFY FOR THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS IN 
LONDON THEY WILL HAVE TO WAIT 
UNTIL THE OLYMPICS AFTER THAT BUT 
THIS IS JUST THE KIND OF TALENT WE 
ARE TRYING TO NURTURE IN BRITAIN 
NOW AND WHO KNOWS ONE DAY PERHAPS 
THEY WILL HAVE A GOLD MEDAL HANGING 
AROUND THEIR NECKS OFF YOU GO 
BACK TO LONDON 
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY 
VERY MUCH TO WIN A GOLD MEDAL 
WONDERFUL NOW LET'S TURN OUR 
ATTENTION TO THE WEATHER 
FOR MOST OF US THIS AFTERNOON YOU 
WILL NOTICE QUITE A MORE EASTERLY 
WIND HAS BEEN DEVELOPING THIS WIND 
IS A LITTLE BIT ON THE CHILLY SIDE 
THIS AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY TOWARDS 
NORTH SEA FACING COASTS IT IS 
GOING TO BRING WITH IT A LITTLE BIT 
MORE IN THE WAY OF CLOUD THE CLOUD 
HAS BEEN DEVELOPING JUST OFF THE 
COAST OF DENMARK THIS IS HEADING 
OUT INTO THE NORTH SEA AND WORKING 
ITS WAY OVER TOWARDS US IT IS 
BRINGING WITH IT SOME SHOWERS THEY 
WILL BE DEVELOPING QUITE WIDELY 
ACROSS THE BORDERS OF SCOTLAND IN 
TOWARDS NORTH EAST ENGLAND THIS IS 
ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK 
IT WILL FEEL QUITE COLD JUST NINE IN 
PARTS OF IPSWICH FOR EXAMPLE 
PERHAPS TWELVE IN LONDON BUT IN THE 
WIND IT WILL FEEL SOMEWHAT COOLER 
JUST A FEW SHOWERS DOTTED AROUND IN 
SOUTHERN ENGLAND SOME GUSTY WINDS 
TO WATCH OUT FOR 
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND THE SHOWERS 
CONFINED TO THE SOUTH FURTHER 
NORTH LOOKING BRIGHT BUT BREEZY 
NOT TOO BAD FOR NORTHERN AND
