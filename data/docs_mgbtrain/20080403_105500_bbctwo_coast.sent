THE RUGGED AND REMOTE COAST OF THE OUTER HEBRIDES 
A COAST OF ISLANDS SKERRIES 
AND LOCHANS 
NOWHERE ELSE IN THE BRITISH ISLES CAN MATCH THIS WONDERLAND OF STACKS SECRET INLETS 
AND WINDSWEPT SHELL SAND BEACHES 
THE VIKINGS CALLED THEM HAVBRODOY ISLANDS ON THE EDGE OF THE SEA 
AND THE EDGE IS EXACTLY WHAT IT FEELS LIKE 
OVER TO THE EAST ARE THE INNER HEBRIDES 
AND MAINLAND SCOTLAND ITSELF BUT OVER TO THE WEST 
THERES NOTHING BUT TWO THOUSAND MILES OF ATLANTIC OCEAN 
ON MY TRAVELS I'VE MET LOADS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CAPTIVATED BY THE COAST 
BUT FEW HAVE THE COURAGE TO GET THIS CLOSE 
TWO FEET ABOVE THE WATER 
PADDY WINTERTON COMPLETED A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILE KAYAK TRIP UNAIDED AND ALL ALONE 
FROM GLASGOW TO THE OUTER HEBRIDES 
WITH A BRIEF STOP OFF AT SAINT KILDA AND ON TO THE TIP OF SHETLAND 
MUCKLE FLUGGA THE U. K.'S MOST NORTHERLY POINT 
PADDY CAPTURED THIS REMARKABLE VOYAGE OF ENDURANCE WITH HIS OWN CAMERA 
I'VE JUST BEEN ROUND LEWIS 
AND ALL I CAN SAY IS I'M SHAKING THAT WAS QUITE STAGGERING 
EVEN THE BIG CROSSINGS DON'T COMPARE TO GOING AROUND HEADLANDS LIKE THIS 
THERE'S CURRENT COMING BOTH WAYS BIG SWELL COMING FROM THE ATLANTIC 
BUT IT'S GOOD THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
I CAUGHT UP WITH HIM 
IN THE MORE TRANQUIL WATERS OF STORNOWAY HARBOUR 
WHEN YOU'RE APPROACHING AN ISLAND IN ONE OF THESE IT STRIKES ME THAT YOU'RE SEEING IT 
IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE FIRST ARRIVALS ON THE ISLANDS 
TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM 
AND ESPECIALLY IN SOMETHING THIS SMALL 
YOU'VE ONLY GOT A VANTAGE HEIGHT OF TWO FEET 
SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PICK YOUR LANDING SPOT 
BUT IT'S ALSO QUITE EXCITING BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO ASSESS 
IS THERE ANYWHERE TO STAY IS THERE ANY FOOD IS THERE ANY WATER 
EXACTLY THE SAME SORT OF THINGS THEY WENT THROUGH 
I'D BEEN GOING FOR EIGHT HOURS FIFTY TWO MINUTES BEFORE I SAW LAND 
AND I WAS ONLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY METRES AWAY FROM IT 
IN FACT I HEARD IT A LONG TIME BEFORE I SAW IT 
WHAT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU'RE ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN 
TO BE HONEST IF THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IF THERE'S A LOT OF WIND AND WAVES 
YOU'RE BUSY THINKING ABOUT THAT 
HOPEFULLY THERES LOTS OF WILDLIFE WHICH KEEPS YOU GOING 
YOU HAVE TO BE DISCIPLINED YOU HAVE TO FEED AND DRINK 
SO THERES QUITE A LOT OF THINKING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO GET THERE 
THE PLEASURE ISN'T IN THE CROSSING 
THE PLEASURE IS IN ARRIVING IN THESE FANTASTIC PLACES 
THAT VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO 
YOU CAN LAND ON BEACHES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN TRODDEN FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND MAKE THEM YOUR OWN 
YOU FEEL A BIT LIKE A LAIRD FOR A NIGHT 
WHAT IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM OR THE BIGGEST DANGER THAT YOU RUN ACROSS 
YOU'VE GOT WHALES CONTAINER SHIPS WAVES 
BUT THE BIGGEST THING OF ALL IS PROBABLY THE WIND 
AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE IN THE STRENGTH OF THE WIND 
ONCE YOU'RE UP TO FORCE EIGHT YOU HAVE NO OPTION BUT TO GO WITH IT 
AND IF IT'S GOING TO AMERICA YOU'RE GOING TO AMERICA TILL IT DIES DOWN 
BUT ANY DAY OF THE WEEK I'D RATHER BE IN ONE OF THESE 
THAN IN A SMALL FISHING BOAT WHICH YOU ALSO MEET FORTY MILES OUT TO SEA 
SO YOU FEEL SAFER IN THAT THAN YOU WOULD IN S. Y. TWENTY SIX 
ANY DAY OF THE WEEK CERTAINLY YEAH
