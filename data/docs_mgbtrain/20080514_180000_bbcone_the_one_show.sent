CHRISTINE ON THE OTHER HAND HAS 
NEVER MISSED ONE NO SOONER THAN 
THE SHOW THINK HIT IS SHORES 
WOMEN WERE CARRIED MIRANDAS 
CHARLOTTES OR SAMANTHA OUR MEN 
FOLK THEY WERE CONFUSED THEY 
DIDN'T GET IT AND THE ONE SHOW'S 
OWN CARRIE BRADSHAW LUCY SEIGLE 
RECKONS THE SEXES WILL BE A MYSTERY 
TO EACH OTHER OVER THE CENTURIES 
HUMAN KIND HAS SOLVED MANY MINISTRY 
BUS THERE IS ONE CONUNDRUM THATEL 
LEWD THE GREAT THINKER WHY DO MEN 
AND WOMEN THINK SO DIFFERENTLY 
THE MORE I LEARN ABOUT WOMEN THE 
LESS I UNDERSTAND 
MEN AND WOMEN 
ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WOMEN WOMEN UNMEN BETTER THAN MEN UNDERSTAND 
WOMEN 
DO I THINK MEN UNDERSTAND WOMEN WOMEN NO OF COURSE NOT NEVER 
NEVER 
WHY IS HE SO OBSESSED WITH NEVER GOAL IN HIS CAREER AND HIS 
FOOTBALL TEAM 
WHY CAN'T SHE 
UNDERSTAND THAT SPORT IS MATTER OF 
LIFE AND DEATH AND SOMETIMES IT IS 
MORE IMPORTANT 
THE THING THAT 
ANNOYS ME ABOUT WOMEN AND THEIR 
GENERAL BEHAVIOUR IS THEIR NAGGING 
LEAVING THE TOILET SEAT UP MY MY GIRLFRIEND ANNOYS ME BECAUSE SHE 
CUT HEARSE TOENAILS IN THE BATH AND 
DOESN'T LEAN IT UP 
WHY DOESN'T MEN 
HAVE RESPECT FOR SOF FURNISHING 
WHAT 
ARE SOFT FURNISHINGINGS WE WE ARE TOO INTELLIGENT FOR THEM AND 
THEY WILL NEVER GET US THEY DON'T 
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT 
TO UNDERSTAND IT 
THEY WILL 
REMEMBER AN ARGUMENT YOU HAD MAYBE 
A YEAR OR SO AGO AND BRING IT UP A 
YEAR LATER AT THE PERFEBG EFFECT 
MOMENT 
PERFECT WILL WE EVER MOMENT UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER 
PROBABLY NOT 
OH SORRY 
FANCY A COFFEE SO I 
WILL BUY YOU A COFFEE 
NO I AM 
BUYING SHE IS A MARRIED WOMAN YOU 
KNOW DISGRACEFUL KRISTIN DO YOU 
THINK MEN AND WOMEN MISUNDERSTOOD 
EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS THEY EVER 
DID 
YES YES I DO L. KNOW I AM ON DID A SHOW WHERE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE 
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER BUT 
IT DOES SEEM THERE IS A GAP WHAT 
DO YOU THINK 
I USED TO THINK APART 
FROM THE DANGLY BITS MEN AND WOMEN 
WERE THE SAME BUT THEN I HAD 
DAUGHTERS AND I REALISED IT IS 
GENETICALLY PROGRAMMED TO BE 
DIFFERENT WHICH IS ILLUSTRATED THIS 
THIS LITTLE CLIP WE HAVE FROM A 
PROGRAMME CALLED CHILD OF OUR TIME 
TWO SETS OF BOTTLES WERE FILLED 
WITH THE SAME LEMONADE ONE WITH 
BLOCK LABELS THE OTHER PINK BOYS 
AND GIRLS WHICH ONES DO YOU PREFER 
TEN OUT OF TEN SEVEN OUT OF TEN 
THAT ONE 
WHY DO YOU LIKE THAT ONE 
BECAUSE THAT ONE IS BIT MORE DARK 
AND DON'T LIKE IT YUCK 
WE WILL YUCK HAVE BATTLE OF THE SEXES AT THE 
END OF THE SHOW WE WILL RESOLVE 
ONCE AND FOR ALL OF WHICH SEX IS 
BEST BY MEANS OF A GAME CALLED 
HEELS OR WHEELS KRISTIN OR 
PRODUCTION BUDGET IS VERY SMALL L. 
WOULD LIKE THE APOLOGISE FOR THAT 
THING THERE 
IT THINK IT IS 
ADORABLE 
WE ARE INDEED HERE ON ADORABLE THE ONE SHOW ONE OF THE MANY 
SPECIES OR WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT HAS 
COVERED IS BATS CLEVER LITTLE 
DEVILS THEY ARE ALMOST TOTALLY 
BLIND BUT NAVIGATE BY MAKING 
CLICKING NOISE AND INTERPRETING THE 
ECHO TO WORK OUT WHERE THE 
OBSTACLES ARE IF THEY CAN GET 
ABOUT LIKE THAT WHY NOT BLIND HUMAN 
BEINGS PETER P. WHITE WHO HAS BEEN 
BLIND SINCE BIRTH HAS AN ACUTE 
SENSE OF HEARING UNLIKE MOST OF US 
HE CAN DETECT SMALL DIFFERENTS IN 
THE WAY THE SOUND HE MAKES ECHO 
BACK 
SO WILL IS A BUILDING OVER BACK THERE 
VERY GOOD 
THERE IS CAR THERE VERY GOOD USING ECHO LOCATION 
PETER CAN TELL A SURPRISING AMOUNT 
ABOUT THE WORLD 
I HAVE IT ON THE 
RADAR IF I LOOK OVER THERE AND 
OVER THERE IT IS NOT AS WIDE AS 
THAT BUILDING BACK THERE IT IS 
PROBABLY A TREE L. 
I AM IMPRESSED 
WHEN I DO THIS I GET ABSOLUTELY 
NOTHING 
REALLY NO 
NO SENSE OF NOTHING ANYTHING AT ALL 
YOU HAVE TO 
REMEMBER I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS 
SINCE I WAS ABOUT FOUR YOU DO NEED 
A LOT OF PRACTICE L. CAN HEAR THAT 
EVEN WHEN YOU ARE DOING THE 
CLICKING 
AND THAT IS THE TROUBLE CLICKING WITH ECHO LOCATION IT REQUIRES 
YEARS OF PRACTICE IF YOU LOSE YOUR 
SIGHT LATE IN LIFE IT IS VERY HARD 
TO LEARN HOWEVER RESEARCH INTO 
BRAIN ENHANCEMENT MAY OFFER SOME 
SOLUTIONS PROFESSOR KEVIN WARWICK 
HAS DEVELOPED AN ULTRASOUND DEVICE 
THAT CAN GET PEOPLE ECHO LOCATING 
IN MINUTES 
HOW ARE YOU 
THIS IS 
THE HI TECH HAT 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
TRY 
HOW DO I LOOK THE HAT DETECTS TRY HOW FARTHINGS ARE AWAY AND BY 
HOLDING TWO VIBRATING BUZZERS I GET 
AN IDEA OF WHAT IS ROUND ME 
OH YES 
I CAN FEEL A VIBE THERE 
TO TEST IT 
OUT WE SET UP AN OBSTACLE COURSE 
WHICH I AM GOING TO TRY AND 
NAVIGATE ROUND BLINDFOLD 
THERE IS SOMETHING OVER THERE 
THERE IS SOMETHING THERE 
AS I 
APPROACH AN OBSTACLE THE HAND 
BUZZERS INCREASE THEIR VIBRATION SO 
I NEED TO GO IN THE DIRECTION WHERE 
THERE IS NO BUZZING EASIER SAID 
THAN DONE BUT AFTER A SURPRISINGLY 
SHORT TIME I BEGIN TO SENSE MY WAY 
ROUND THERE IS SOMETHING RIGHT IN 
FRONT OF ME THERE IS SOMETHING 
THERE IS THAT YOU 
IT IS ME YOU 
ARE DOING WELL SOMETHING EXPENSIVE 
WENT OVER U. ONLY ONE 
BUT HE HAS 
MORE AMBITIOUS IDEAS THAN HATS AND 
BUZZERS C. H. 
IT IS A PROTOTYPE AT 
THE MOMENT 
WHERE DO YOU SIGH THIS 
GOING 
WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE GOING BUZZERS IT COULD BE FED FOIN THE 
NERVOUS SYSTEM INTO THE BRAIN SO 
YOU DON'T NEED THESE 
ISN'T THAT A 
BIT FAR FETCHED 
IT IS SOMETHING WE 
HAVE DONE IF YOU HAVE A LOOK AT 
THIS THIS IS VERY SMALL THIS WAS 
FIRED INTO MY NERVOUS SYSTEM AS 
PART OF AN EXPERIMENT THEY FIRED 
THIS IN LIKE PUTTING A PLUG IN AND 
WE FED THE OUTPUT FROM THESE 
ULTRASOUND SENSOR DOWN ON THE MY 
NERVOUS SYSTEM SO INSTEAD OF THE 
BUZZER MY BRAIN WAS RECEIVING 
PULSES OF CURRENT THE CLOSER AN 
OBJECT CAME THE MORE PULSES MY 
BRAIN WAS RECEIVING 
DID IT FEEL 
DIFFERENT TO HOLDING A THING IN 
YOUR HAND IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE 
HOLDING IT IN MY HAND L. FELT LIKE 
THERE IS SOMETHING CLOSE OR NOT SO 
CLOSE AS YOU WERE DOING WITH THE 
BUZZING I WAS ABLE TO DO AS A NEW 
SENSE AN ULTRA SONIC SENSE YOU 
COULD STICK OTHER SENSES IN I I THINK INFRA RED MAYBE EVEN X. RAY 
ULTRAVIOLET WE HAVE TO SEE WITH 
RESEARCH HOW BROAD HOW MANY MORE 
SENSES QUESTION HAVE HOW BROAD CAN 
WE SENSE THE WORLD 
WELL THAT WAS EXCITING BUT RATHER 
DISTURBING IF KEVIN IS RIGHT THEN 
THE WORLD OF THE SCIENTIFICLY 
ENHANCED HUMAN BEING MIGHT BE 
CLOSER THAN WE THINK PETER IS A 
COLLEAGUE OF OURS HERE NEW 
TECHNOLOGY IS IT THERE DANGER IN 
HANKERING OFF SOLUTION THAT IS 
NEVER GOING TO COME 
WELL I THINK 
SOME BLIND PEOPLE BECAUSE SIGHT IS 
ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHICH OBVIOUSLY 
PEOPLE VALUE ENORMOUSLY IF YOU 
LOSE IT YOU ARE GOING TO WORRY 
ABOUT I WHAT WORRIES ME IS I COULD 
POINT YOU TO A NEW CURE MIRACLE 
CURE FOR BLINDNESS IN EVERY WEEK 
THERE IS ALWAYS ONE THE LAST TIME 
WE MADE A REAL DIFFERENCE TO THE 
AMOUNT OF SIGHT WE COULD SAVE WAS 
BACK IN THE EARLY FIFTIES WITH 
DEVELOPMENTS FOR CATARACT OPERATION 
SO I WOULD URGE PEOPLE NOT TO GO 
CHASING ROUND AFTER CURE BUT MORE 
TO MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT YOU HAVE 
GOT 
BUT HOW MUCH DO YOU RELY ON GOT THIS ECHO LOCATION 
MORE THAN I 
THINK BECAUSE IT IS ALMOST 
SUBCONSCIOUS I LEARNED TO DO THIS 
UNDER A BRIDGE WHEN I WAS FOUR AND 
YOU GET AN ECHO THAT IS WHAT IT IS 
AND I WAS RATHER AMAZED WHEN THIS 
WHOLE THING BEGAN TO DEVELOP WHEN 
IT BECAME A HUGE STORY L. WENT UP 
TO SCOTLAND AND FOUND SOME CHILDREN 
WHO WENT TO A MAINSTREAM SCHOOL 
SAYING THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS 
HAPPENED 
YOU LEARNED IT ADD BLIND HAPPENED SCHOOL AND THERE IS FEWER BLIND 
CHILDREN AT SPECIAL SCHOOLS NOW 
ISN'T THERE 
IT IS TENDING TO 
HAPPEN LESS AND OF COURSE WILL IS 
A LOT TO BE SAID FOR MAINSTREAM 
EDUCATION BUT THE MOST VALUABLE 
THINGS I LEARNED I LEARNED FROM 
OTHER BLIND KIDS THEY WERE GOING 
ROUND DOING THIS WE THOUGHT THEY 
WERE STRANGE BUT IT IS A VERY 
VALUABLE SKILL 
MICHAEL WHERE IS 
SCIENCE ON THIS 
VERY EARLY I WOULD 
SAY THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT 
KEVIN IS HE DOESN'T WANT TO DEAL 
WITH PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SEE WHAT HE 
WANTS TO DO IS ENHANCE HIS ABILITY 
SO HE WANTED TO STICK AN ELECTRODE 
IN AND SEE IN INFRA RED X. RAY YOU 
NAME IT HE LIKES THE IDEA OF 
BECOME AGO SUPERHUMAN THAT IS THE 
AREA OF RESEARCH HE IS IN THE 
ENTER FACE BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY AND 
SENSES 
THANK YOU INTERFACE SENSES LAST WEEK GORDON RAMSAY CALLED FOR 
RESTAURANT TO BE BANNED FROM

I AM DEAF I AM SO EXCITED 
SORRY I AM SO SORRY EVERYONE BUT 
THIS IS MY FRIEND AND SHE JUST GOT 
ENGAGED AND SHE HAS BEEN GOING OUT 
WITH THE MAN FOR TEN YEARS 
I AM 
MORTIFIED 
THERE IS A RINGING IN MY MORTIFIED EAR 
I LOVE THAT BIT 
THANK YOU EAR WHERE WAS THAT SHOT 
WE ARE IN THE 
RESTAURANT OF THE MUSEUM OF MODERN 
ART IN MID TOWN IT IS ABOUT FOURAM 
RIGHT THEN WHEN I AM SQUEALING AT 
THE TOP OF MY LUNGS YES INDEED AND 
OUR DIRECTOR WOULD COME UP TO ME 
AND SAY NEXT TIME REALLY DO A BIG 
SCREAM AND I WOULD SAY THAT WAS 
THE BIG SCREAM WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
HE WOULD SAY NO REALLY BIG AND 
LIKE IT KEPT GOING TO THE POINT 
WHERE I WAS O. K. SO NOW I GET THE 
NEXT WEEK OFF TO RECOVER BUT IT 
TURNED OUT O. K. L. WAS WORRIED IT 
WOULDN'T BE EXCITED ENOUGH 
IT WAS 
PERFECT I LOVED WATCHING IT L. AM 
TRYING TO CONVINCE HIM TO GET INTO 
SEX AND THE CITY BUT WE HAVE BEEN 
SAYING MEN RUNWAY FROM IT AND 
FRIGHTENED OF IT BUT WE LOOK ADD T. T. 
FIGURES AND FORTY PER CENT OF THE AUDIENCE ARE 
MEN IS THAT THE SENSE YOU GET 
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T NECESSARILY 
RUN UP TO ME ON THE STREET IN THE 
WAY THAT 
SAY WOMAN WOULD BUT THEY SAY QUIETLY YOU KNOW I REALLY LIKE 
THE SHOW MY WIFE MADE ME WATCH IT 
IT IS MORE LIKE THEY QUIETLY SAY 
THAT YES 
AND MEN TALKING SO 
FRANKLY ABOUT THE OPPOSITE SEX 
WOMEN TALKING ABOUT THE OPPOSITE 
SEX DID THAT FEEL RADICAL WHEN YOU 
SAW THE SCRIPT 
YES BECAUSE IT WAS 
VERY BOLD THE WAY WE WERE TALKING 
I THINK MEN AND WOMEN TALK ABOUT 
EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME BUT IT WAS 
EXTREMELY BOLD SOMETIMES FOUR 
LETTER WORDS SO IT WAS SHOCKING AND 
WE DOIDN'T KNOW IF PEOPLE WOULD 
LIKE IT 
WAS THAT ART IMITATING 
LIFE WAS THAT HOW WOMEN TALK IT IT WAS HOW THIS GROUP OF WOMEN SPOKE 
IT WAS BASED O. AN REAL GROUP OF 
WOMEN CANDACE BUSHNELL WROTE A 
COLUMN AND WE ARE BASED ON HER AND 
HER FRIEND BELIEVE ME THEY TALK 
LIKE THIS 
THAT IS WHAT SCARED MEN 
WHEN THEY WAB WATCHED IT 
AS THE SHOW DEVELOPED IT BECAME 
LESS ABOUT THE SHOCK VALUE AND MORE 
ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AND 
RELATIONSHIPS 
MEN CAN LEARN A BIT RELATIONSHIPS FROM WATCHING IT 
IF THEY PAY 
ATTENTION 
YOU STARTED OUT AS THIRTY ATTENTION SOMETHINGS THE TEN YEARS AGO AND 
NOW YOU'RE MORE MATURE CHARACTERS 
ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE THE LOVABLE 
VARIATIONS IN EACH OF THE 
CHARACTERS DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT 
AS YOU'RE COMING TO THE MOVIE 
STAGE 
WE ARE FORTY SOMETHINGS YOU'RE STAGE ALLOWED TO SAY IT AND THAT'S PART 
OF THE GREAT THING AS AN ACTRESS 
YOU WORRY IF YOU'RE YOUNG IF I'M 
NOT FAMOUS BY X. AGE IT'S ALL OVER 
OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN DIFFERENT 
AND IT'S GREAT FOR US AND THE FACT 
THE FANS RESPOND THAT WE DON'T 
PRETEND TO BE YOUNGER IT IS PART 
OF THE WHOLE THING WE FELT WE GOT 
TO GROW UP WITH THE CHARACTERS 
WHICH IS SO GREAT ABOUT THE MOVIE 
WE SEE WHERE THEIR LIVES ARE GOING 
AND DEAL WITH SUBJECT MATTER OF 
MAYBE DEEPER 
THERE'S A LITTLE OF 
THE PRESS AS WELL ABOUT THE FEW 
ARGUMENTS BACKSTAGE AS IT WERE BUT 
SOMETIMES THE PRESS DON'T BELIEVE 
YOU GET ALONG 
WE USED TO GO OUT 
AND REFUTE EVERY ITEM AND WE GOT 
WORN OUT DOING THAT NO ONE WANTS 
TO LISTEN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SELL 
TABLOID MAGAZINES AT THIS POINT WE 
LET IT ROLL OFF OUR BACKS I FEEL 
OUR FANS KNOW THE TRUTH WE DON'T 
AND COULDN'T BE THAT TALENTED IF WE 
DIDN'T SPEAK L. GOT SOMEONE SAY OH
