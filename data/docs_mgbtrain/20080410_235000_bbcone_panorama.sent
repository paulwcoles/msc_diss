HELLO I'M JEREMY VINE AND THIS IS PANORAMA 
TONIGHT THE LENGTHS WE'RE GOING TO TO KEEP TWO COMMUNITIES APART 
YOU'VE HEARD OF RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS BUT PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC BUS STOPS ANYONE 
THIS IS THE PRICE OF PEACE AND WE'RE ALL PAYING IT 
THERE REALLY IS A CARVE UP AND WHEN IS THAT GOING TO STOP 
WHERE IS THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP THAT SAYS WE NEED ANOTHER TYPE OF CITIZENSHIP AND SOCIETY 
IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS SINCE THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
AND MOST PEOPLE THERE WOULD AGREE THAT LIFE HAS NEVER BEEN SO GOOD 
SOLDIERS ON THE STREETS HAVE BEEN CONSIGNED TO THE HISTORY BOOKS 
THE ECONOMY IS ON THE UP AND NORTHERN IRELAND HAS BECOME 
THE KIND OF PLACE THAT MOST PEOPLE IN THE U. K. WOULD CONSIDER MOVING TO CERTAINLY HOLIDAYING IN 
WHY THEN ARE THE FENCES BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES STILL GOING UP INSTEAD OF COMING DOWN 
HERE'S DECLAN LAWN 
WELCOME TO THE NEW NORTHERN IRELAND 
THEY USED TO BURN BUSES HERE 
NOW TEN YEARS AFTER THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT THEY'RE ON THE TOURIST TRAIL 
AND THE TROUBLES ARE ALL PART OF THE ATTRACTION 
MANY MANY PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES 
ONLY THE MOST FOOLHARDY WOULD HAVE WALKED THROUGH HERE AFTER SIX O'CLOCK AT NIGHT 
SUCH WAS THE LEVEL OF DANGER 
SIMPLY INDICATING LEFT OR RIGHT COULD BE ENOUGH TO SEAL YOUR FATE 
WHEN GUNMEN WOULD STEP FROM THE SHADOWS AND KILL YOU WHERE YOU SAT 
A STAGGERING FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE TOOK THIS TOUR LAST YEAR 
WOULD YOU HAVE TRAVELLED TO SEE BELFAST FIVE OR TEN YEARS AGO 
UM NO I DON'T THINK SO 
FOR ME IT IS NOT THAT IT IS NOT QUITE SAFE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
WE DIDN'T COME HERE BECAUSE WE WERE AFRAID 
THE SAME AS THE ENGLISH THEY DIDN'T COME OVER COS THEY WERE AFRAID 
BUT IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE THE PEACE 
IT IS INTERESTING IT HAS A LOT OF HISTORY AND WE WANT TO SEE MORE 
PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND SPENT THIRTY YEARS WATCHING THINGS GO BANG 
NOW THEY ARE LOOKING AT A BOOM 
NEXT YEAR ABOUT TWO BILLION OF PUBLIC MONEY 
WILL BE INVESTED IN INFRASTRUCTURE HERE 
THAT'S THREE TIMES AS MUCH 
AS TEN YEARS AGO 
NORTHERN IRELAND HAS HAD A DRAMATIC TRANSFORMATION 
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS HOUSE PRICES ARE UP 
BY OVER FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN BY OVER SEVENTY PER CENT 
FROM UP HERE ON BELFAST'S BIG WHEEL YOU GET AN AMAZING VIEW OF A CITY BEING REBORN 
BUT IT IS STILL NOT AS BREATH TAKING AS SOME OF THE SIGHTS AT STORMONT 
THE SEAT OF NORTHERN IRELAND'S NEW GOVERNMENT 
WE ARE THE CHUCKLE BROTHERS 
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME FUN 
AIN'T NO ONE GONNA STOP US WE'VE GOT BATTLES TO BE WON 
WE USED TO BE SO SERIOUS 
WE NEVER CRACKED A SMILE 
NOW WE FIND THAT LAUGHING 
IS BETTER BY A MILE 
THIS IS SOMETHING PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND THOUGHT THEY'D NEVER SEE 
IAN PAISLEY AND MARTIN MCGUINNESS SHARING POWER IS ONE THING 
BUT SHARING JOKES THEIR CHUMMINESS HAS EVEN EARNED THEM A NICKNAME THE CHUCKLE BROTHERS 
WE REALLY HAVE A LAUGH 
CHUCKLE CHUCKLE CHUCKLE HA HA HA 
CHUCKLE CHUCKLE CHUCKLE HO HO HO 
USED TO HATE EACH OTHER 
BUT WHO WOULD EVER KNOW 
PAISLEY IS STEPPING DOWN AS FIRST MINISTER IN MAY 
LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM PART OF HIS LEGACY WILL BE A SOCIETY THAT IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE 
SO THAT'S IT THEN PEACE 
NORTHERN IRELAND ISN'T ABOUT TERRORISM ANY MORE IT'S ABOUT TOURISM 
FROM THE TOP OF THIS BUS IT LOOKS AS IF THE SETTLEMENT HERE 
COULD BE AN EXAMPLE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD 
BUT WHAT DOES PEACE REALLY LOOK LIKE IN A SOCIETY WHERE TRIBAL DIVISIONS GO BACK HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
WELL LET'S SEE 
WE'RE GOING OFF THE TOURIST TRAIL TO TAKE AN ALTERNATIVE TOUR OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
AND WHAT BETTER PLACES TO VISIT THAN THE BACKYARDS OF IAN PAISLEY AND MARTIN MCGUINNESS 
I HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH THESE TWO VERY DIFFERENT MEN 
I SPENT MY TEENAGE YEARS IN PAISLEY'S HEARTLAND OF BALLYMENA 
BUT I SPENT MY CHILDHOOD IN MCGUINNESS'S HOME TOWN OF LONDONDERRY ALSO KNOWN AS DERRY 
KNOWING ME KNOWING YOU A HA 
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP HERE IT WAS THE LATE SEVENTIES 
ABBA WERE IN THE CHARTS 
LUKE SKYWALKER WAS DOING BATTLE WITH DARTH VADER 
AND DERRY WAS BEING BLOWN TO BITS 
MAINLY BY MARTIN'S MATES 
THAT KIND OF VIOLENCE MAY BE A THING OF THE PAST BUT ACCORDING TO PEACE WORKER MICHAEL DOHERTY 
THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF FRICTION BETWEEN THE TWO COMMUNITIES HERE 
THE ONLY THING THAT TRANSFORMED IN OUR CONFLICT IS IT'S LESS VIOLENT 
I BELIEVE THE CONFLICT IS NOT OVER 
I BELIEVE WE'VE A HELL OF A LOT MORE WORK TO DO IN OUR CONFLICT 
TO TRY TO GET IT TRANSFORMED INTO A SITUATION 
WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT EVEN BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT THE TERM RECONCILIATION 
DERRY IS A PLACE SCARRED BY SEGREGATION 
BEFORE THE TROUBLES THE POPULATION WAS RELATIVELY MIXED 
BUT AS THE VIOLENCE GOT WORSE THE CITY POLARISED 
ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RIVER FOYLE 
NOW IT IS OVERWHELMINGLY CATHOLIC ON THE WEST BANK 
WITH A PROTESTANT MAJORITY ON THE EAST BANK 
FEAR AND PERCEPTION PLAYED AN AWFUL PART OF THE POPULATION MOVEMENT THAT HAPPENED IN THE CITY 
THERE IS ONLY ONE POCKET OF PROTESTANTS LEFT IN THE CITY IN THE FOUNTAIN ESTATE 
THE FOUNTAIN ESTATE THE LAST REMAINING PROTESTANT ENCLAVE 
ON THE WEST BANK OF THE RIVER FOYLE 
A TINY PATCH OF ORANGE IN A BLANKET OF GREEN 
IT IS LARGELY SURROUNDED BY HIGH SECURITY FENCES 
AND MONITORED TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY BY C. C. T. V. 
THIS IS BIG BROTHER NORTHERN IRELAND STYLE 
THE MAIN VEHICLE ENTRANCE INTO THE FOUNTAIN IS UP THIS NARROW STREET 
MOST OF THE HOUSES HAVE BEEN ABANDONED BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO LIVE ON THIS INTERFACE 
INSIDE THE ESTATE RESIDENTS FEEL UNDER SIEGE 
WILLIAM JACKSON IS ONE OF THOSE RESIDENTS 
HIS FAMILY HOME SITS RIGHT ALONGSIDE THE SECURITY FENCES 
WILLIAM SAYS THAT FOR YEARS THE HOUSE HAS BEEN 
A MAGNET FOR MISSILES THROWN BY YOUNG CATHOLICS' 
THESE ARE SOME OF THE STUFF THEY WOULD THROW OVER PETROL BOMBS 
PAINT BOMBS A PETROL BOMB THAT ACTUALLY IGNITED IN THE GARDEN 
AND I ACTUALLY SAW THE FLAME IT SCARED THE LIFE OUT OF ME 
BUT I MANAGED TO RUN OVER PUT IT OUT 
SO YOUR GARDEN THIS WAS ALIGHT THAT WAS ALL ALIGHT 
WHAT IS THE STUFF IN IT 
THAT IS SUGAR THE SUGAR STICKS TO YOU AND CAUSES MORE DAMAGE 
SO THIS IS A PAINT BOMB THAT IS A PAINT BOMB 
THOSE YOU WOULD GET ANY TIME AT ALL WHENEVER THEY FEEL LIKE THROWING IT 
THIS ONE LOOKS PRETTY FRESH 
THAT ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN THREE TO FOUR WEEKS AGO 
YOU HAVE HERE NOW TWO FENCES 
ONE RIGHT UP AGAINST YOUR HOUSE YEP 
AND THEN ANOTHER HIGHER ONE 
AND THESE MISSILES ARE MANAGING TO CLEAR BOTH OF THEM 
OH THEY CLEAR BOTH FENCES 
THE PRECAUTIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
IS PERSPEX FOR ALL UPPER GROUND FLOOR WINDOWS 
THESE ARE THE MESH SECURITY THESE ARE THE MESH SECURITY ONES 
THEY JUST SIT ABOUT THE YARD AND AS SOON AS THE FIRST STONE COMES ALONG 
YOU LITERALLY LIFT IT AND PUT IT BACK ON AGAIN YOU KNOW 
THEY ARE LIGHT ENOUGH THAT THE WIFE OR EVEN ONE OF THE CHILDREN COULD LIFT IT 
WILLIAM SAYS THAT THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE ATTACKS ARE CATHOLIC TEENAGERS 
WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN IN NURSERY SCHOOL WHEN THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED 
CAN YOU SEE AN END TO THIS ANY TIME SOON 
NO NOT REALLY NOT AS LONG AS THERE IS PROTESTANTS IN THE WEST BANK 
THAT'S WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO 
POLITICIANS MIGHT TRY AND TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE OF THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT 
THAT IT'S NOW PEACETIME 
THEY WANT TO TRY LIVING IN THE PERIMETER OF AN ESTATE LIKE THIS 
THAT IS TOTALLY CATHOLIC THE WHOLE WAY ROUND 
THE VIOLENCE COMES FROM BOTH SIDES 
AND SOME OF THOSE CATHOLICS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE 
FIND LIVING HERE JUST AS DIFFICULT 
SO YOU'VE SEEN QUITE A LOT OF TROUBLE HERE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF RIOTS UM 
WE WERE SUBJECT TO A NIGHTLY ORGY OF VIOLENCE 
THE ONLY RESPITE WE EVER GOT WAS IN REALLY BAD DAYS OF RAIN 
I USED TO PRAY FOR RAIN EVERY DAY 
WHEN THE RIOTERS PICKED UP THEIR STONES EAMON PICKED UP HIS CAMERA 
DISGUSTING TO SEE TWO GROUPINGS OF YOUNG MEN 
ONE FROM THE CATHOLIC BOGSIDE 
AND ANOTHER GROUPING FROM THE PROTESTANT FOUNTAIN 
COMING IN HERE WITH INTENT 
TO CAUSE DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURIES 
YOU THINK THIS IS OUTRIGHT SECTARIANISM BETWEEN THE SIDES 
YES RAW SECTARIANISM 
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS VOLUNTEERS FROM THE CATHOLIC SIDE 
HAVE PATROLLED THIS AREA AT NIGHT IN A BID TO STOP THE TROUBLE 
IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED 
WITH REPORTED INCIDENTS DOWN SIXTY ONE PER CENT IN THE LAST YEAR 
DO YOU THINK THERE IS STILL A CERTAIN TENSION HERE NOW 
IN THAT THERE IS ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY THAT 
OH ABSOLUTELY THIS COULD FLARE UP AGAIN AT ANY TIME 
IT WOULD ONLY TAKE A PROTESTANT YOUNG PERSON 
TO GO TO THE BATTLEMENTS THERE AND WAVE A UNION JACK AND THERE WOULD BE 
A VIOLENT REACTION TO IT SO THE SECTARIANISM ISN'T GONE AWAY 
NO ABSOLUTELY NOT 
IT WILL TAKE TWO GENERATIONS IF WE EVER GET RID OF IT 
AROUND THE FOUNTAIN THE TWO SIDES ARE SUCCESSFULLY BEING KEPT APART 
BUT WHAT ABOUT BRINGING THEM TOGETHER 
WE STILL HAVE THIS SITUATION OF AVOIDANCE SYNDROME AS I CALL IT 
AVOIDANCE SYNDROME WHAT IS THAT 
IT MEANS WE HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED AT SECTARIANISM 
I THINK WE HAVE AVOIDED TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT DIVIDE US 
WE HAVE CLEVERLY MOVED AWAY TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE 
EXCEPT SECTARIANISM 
MENTION SECTARIANISM AND EVERYBODY CLAMS UP 
SO SECTARIANISM IS STILL ALIVE AND WELL HERE IN DERRY 
IT IS ALIVE AND WELL 
ALIVE AND WELL AND AT TIMES POTENTIALLY LETHAL 
WHILST FILMING IN THE FOUNTAIN WE WERE SHOWN PETROL BOMBS 
THAT HAD COME OVER THE FENCE JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE 
ONE OF THEM WAS EVEN FILLED WITH NAILS 
ONE CONCERN IS THAT SOME OF THOSE WHO TAKE THE TROUBLE TO MAKE DEVICES LIKE THIS 
MIGHT BE DRAWN TOWARDS ORGANISATIONS LIKE THIS 
WHO WANT TO TAKE ON NOT FOUNTAIN RESIDENTS BUT THE BRITISH STATE 
GROUPS LIKE THE REAL I. R. A. WANT TO CAPITALISE ON DISENCHANTMENT WITH THE PEACE PROCESS 
THEY ARE A FRINGE ELEMENT IN DERRY BUT THIS INTERNET FOOTAGE 
SHOWS THEY ARE STILL COMMITTED TO VIOLENCE 
IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO THINK THAT SECTARIAN ATTITUDES 
THAT HAVE BEEN FOSTERED OVER HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
WOULD DISAPPEAR OVERNIGHT BUT WHAT STRIKES YOU HERE 
IS THAT THE ANTAGONISTS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS 
HAVE BEEN SO YOUNG JUST TEENAGERS 
IT SEEMS AS IF THE FEAR AND MISTRUST IS BEING PASSED DOWN TO A NEW GENERATION 
I LEFT DERRY AGED ELEVEN AND MOVED TO A TOWN THAT WAS AN HOUR AWAY 
BUT THAT MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN IN A DIFFERENT WORLD 
BALLYMENA IS THE FLIP SIDE OF DERRY AN OVERWHELMINGLY PROTESTANT TOWN 
THAT IS NESTLED DEEP IN NORTHERN IRELAND'S BIBLE BELT 
THIS IS IAN PAISLEY'S HEARTLAND 
LIKE ANY TOWN IN NORTHERN IRELAND BALLYMENA HAD ITS EVERYDAY DIVISIONS 
JUST BEHIND ME OVER THERE IS THE HOUSE MY FAMILY USED TO LIVE IN IN BALLYMENA 
AND HERE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YARDS ACROSS THE ROAD IS CAMBRIDGE HOUSE SCHOOL 
THIS IS KNOWN AS A GOOD SCHOOL BUT I DIDN'T GO TO IT BECAUSE IT IS OVERWHELMINGLY PROTESTANT 
I WENT TO THE LOCAL CATHOLIC SCHOOL WHICH IS ABOUT TWO MILES AWAY 
EVEN SO WHEN I LIVED HERE BALLYMENA WAS MORE RENOWNED FOR SHOPPING THAN SECTARIANISM 
BUT THINGS BEGAN TO CHANGE IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX 
WHEN PROTESTANT LOYALISTS BEGAN TO PICKET THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
AT HARRYVILLE IN PROTEST OVER THE RE ROUTING OF PARADES 
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS AS CATHOLICS TURNED UP FOR MASS 
LOYALISTS TURNED UP TO TRY TO STOP THEM 
SUDDENLY BALLYMENA WAS IN THE NEWS FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS 
IN THE YEARS AFTER THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT 
THINGS GOT WORSE PARTLY BECAUSE REPUBLICAN FLAGS WERE PUT UP 
IN THE MAINLY CATHOLIC DUNCLUG ESTATE 
WHEN I LIVED IN BALLYMENA IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE 
TO SEE REPUBLICAN FLAGS FLYING IN THE OPEN 
BUT THEY ARE HERE NOW AND THEY'RE A VISIBLE SYMBOL OF HOW IN SOME WAYS 
THIS TOWN HAS BECOME MORE POLARISED IN THE TEN YEARS SINCE THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT NOT LESS 
REPUBLICAN EMBLEMS HAVE CAUSED ANGER IN THE PROTESTANT HEARTLAND OF BALLYMENA 
PROTESTANT LOYALISTS ARE ALSO UPSET THAT PLACES LIKE DUNCLUG 
WHICH WERE ONCE MAJORITY PROTESTANT ARE FOR THEM BECOMING NO GO AREAS' 
I HAVE BEEN REARED IN BALLYMENA ALL MY LIFE 
AND SIX SEVEN YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE WALKED THROUGH DUNCLUG 
BUT NOW I WOULD THINK TWICE 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO BE ATTACKED 
IN BALLYMENA FOR A GENERATION OF YOUNG MEN 
TRIBAL LINES HAVE BEEN DRAWN RIGHT THROUGH THE CENTRE OF TOWN 
MOST SHOPPERS HERE ARE OBLIVIOUS TO THESE INVISIBLE BORDERS 
BUT FOR THIS GROUP OF CATHOLIC TEENAGERS THEY'RE A FACT OF LIFE 
ONE OF THEM HAS ASKED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED 
AS HE'S WORRIED ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF TALKING TO US' 
BEHIND YOU THERE IS WELLINGTON STREET ONE OF THE MAIN SHOPPING STREETS IN TOWN 
WOULD YOU GO DOWN THERE NO 
SO YOU WOULDN'T GO HERE TO THE LEISURE CENTRE NO NO CHANCE 
NO WAY IT'S JUST A NO GO AREA 
WHAT ABOUT HERE WOULD YOU GO TO THE CINEMA NO NO CHANCE 
NOT A PLACE TO GO AND HANG AROUND 
PIZZA HUT NO NO 
AND YOU WOULDN'T GO BOWLING DEFINITELY NOT NAH NO WAY 
DOES EVERYBODY YOUR AGE UNDERSTAND THESE TERRITORIAL DIVISIONS OR IS IT JUST YOU GUYS 
EVERYONE EVEN THE YOUNGER ONES KNOW 
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE END OF THAT STREET IS THE END OF THE CATHOLIC BIT AND THIS IS THE PROTESTANT BIT 
I FELT I MEAN I USED TO LIVE HERE AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS 
QUITE AS TERRITORIALLY DIVIDED AS THIS I MEAN 
I FELT ABLE TO WALK AROUND AT LEAST THE CENTRE OF TOWN QUITE SAFELY 
BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S CHANGED 
NOWADAYS EVERYONE KNOWS WHERE THEY STAND SO THEY DO I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE'RE ALL INNOCENT ALL ANGELS 
BUT THERE'S CERTAIN PARTS IN THE TOWN WHERE WE CAN'T GO AND PEOPLE KNOW THAT 
I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE THINGS BEFORE WENT DOWN TO THEIR PART OF TOWN AND DONE THINGS 
THEY'VE DONE THINGS IN OUR PART SO IT'S A TWO WAY STREET A PROTESTANT COMING UP THIS STREET 
AND INTO YOUR AREA THEY'RE RUNNING A RISK AS WELL 
BOTH SIDES KNOW THE RULES 
WEAR THE WRONG COLOURS IN THE WRONG AREA AND YOU COULD BE IN TROUBLE 
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT A YOUNG PROTESTANT WITH A RANGERS TOP ON 
COULD BE ATTACKED THERE FOR NO REASON FOR JUST BEING A PROTESTANT 
BUT THE PLACE WHERE THE DIVISION IS MOST EVIDENT 
ISN'T ON THE STREETS IT'S ONLINE 
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS RIGHT ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
A PROBLEM THAT GOES BACK HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
HAS BEEN GIVEN A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TWIST AS ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKING FORUMS 
PLAY HOST TO SECTARIAN TAUNTS INSULTS AND THREATS 
IN BALLYMENA THE BEBOCOM FORUM HAS BEEN A HOTHOUSE OF TENSION 
IF YOU LOG ON TO BEBOCOM AND TYPE IN BALLYMENA WITHIN A COUPLE OF CLICKS 
YOU CAN FIND SOME PRETTY RAW SECTARIAN COMMENTS 
IT'S MOSTLY COMING FROM TEENAGERS AND ONLY FROM A MINORITY 
BUT SOME OF IT IS PRETTY VICIOUS 
BUT NOWHERE NEAR AS VICIOUS AS WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN REALITY 
IN MAY TWO THOUSAND SIX CATHOLIC TEENAGER MICHAEL MCILVEEN WAS BEATEN TO DEATH 
IN WHAT'S WIDELY BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN A SECTARIAN ATTACK 
IN THE AFTERMATH BEBOCOM LIT UP WITH HATE AND THREATS OF REPRISALS 
SO MUCH SO THAT BOSSES FROM THE WEBSITE 
EVEN CAME TO BALLYMENA TO APPEAL FOR CALM 
TWO YEARS LATER AND AFTER A LOT OF CROSS COMMUNITY WORK 
ATTACKS IN BALLYMENA ARE DOWN BY OVER SIXTY PER CENT 
WHAT ONE HEARS ABOUT BALLYMENA IS THAT SINCE THE DEATH OF MICHAEL MCILVEEN 
THINGS HAVE CHANGED AND GOT A BIT BETTER PEOPLE HAVE STARTED MEETING EACH OTHER 
YOU'RE LAUGHING NOT WITH OUR AGE GROUP MAYBE WITH YOUNGER AGE GROUP 
BUT DEFINITELY NOT OUR AGE GROUP AND THE TENSIONS ARE STILL BAD 
OF COURSE THEY ARE AND THE TERRITORIES ARE STILL DIVIDED YEP ALWAYS HAS ALWAYS WILL BE 
SO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN HERE IT'S GONNA KEEP CONTINUING 
THESE PROTESTANT LOYALISTS ADMIT THEY'VE GROWN UP 
STEEPED IN SECTARIANISM AND SAY THEY WANT TO SEE CHANGE 
BUT FOR NOW THEIR ATTITUDE REFLECTS WHAT MANY IN NORTHERN IRELAND ARE SETTLING FOR SEGREGATION 
I THINK THAT THE TWO COMMUNITIES ARE QUITE HAPPY TO LIVE 
SIDE BY SIDE IN PEACE THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT 
THEY JUST WANT TO LIVE SIDE BY SIDE IN PEACE AND THEIR OWN AREAS ARE QUITE HAPPY WITH THAT 
WHAT YOU'RE ADVOCATING IS A PEACEFUL SEGREGATION 
I CAN'T I CAN'T EVER SEE THERE BEING 
SOCIAL INTEGRATION ER IN BALLYMENA 
THEY DO WANT TO BRING YOUNG PROTESTANTS AWAY FROM VIOLENT CONFRONTATIONS WITH THE OTHER SIDE 
BUT THEY SAY LEADERSHIP FROM POLITICIANS IS SEVERELY LACKING 
STORMONT THEY DON'T SET A GREAT EXAMPLE FOR THE COMMUNITY WORKERS ON THE GROUND 
WHO ARE SOMETIMES BANGING THEIR HEAD AGAINST A WALL 
TRYING TO GET THINGS DONE BUT THEY CAN'T GET THEM DONE 
BECAUSE POLITICIANS ARE TOO BUSY FIGHTING AMONGST EACH OTHER 
THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING POSITIVE INSTEAD OF THINKING NEGATIVE 
AND SCORING POINTS AGAINST EACH OTHER THEY NEED TO COME INTO THE REAL WORLD AND SEE WHAT WE WANT 
AND YOU FEEL THEY'RE NOT LIVING IN THE REAL WORLD THEY'RE NOT 
WHAT ALL POLITICIANS DON'T UNDERSTAND IS 
THEY'LL ARGUE OVER DINNER AND OVER A CUP OF TEA 
THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND FIGHT WITH BRICKS AND STONES 
THAT'S HOW THEY FIGHT AND SORT THEIR DIFFERENCES OUT 
STORMONT THE SEAT OF NORTHERN IRELAND'S FLEDGLING GOVERNMENT 
IT'S BEEN HAILED AROUND THE WORLD AS A MODEL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION 
BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO PEOPLE ON THE GROUND 
THAT'S A QUESTION BEING ASKED BY ONE ACADEMIC FROM QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY 
YOU HAVE PAISLEY AND MCGUINNESS SITTING TOGETHER 
WHICH IS THAT IMAGE OF CHANGE AND THEN YOU GO A MILE OR TWO FROM HERE 
AND YOU HAVE WALLS THAT HAVE BEEN HEIGHTENED ARE BEING BUILT 
WHICH GIVES YOU A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYMBOL THERE'S NO LINKAGE BETWEEN THE TWO IMAGES 
THAT'S THE POINT FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THOSE AREAS MANY OF THEM CAN'T MAKE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
WHAT HAPPENS HERE AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE 
IN MANY COMMUNITIES THEY'RE NOT BUILDING BRIDGES THEY'RE BUILDING WALLS 
SEVENTEEN OF THESE SO CALLED PEACE WALLS HAVE BEEN PUT UP 
EXTENDED OR HEIGHTENED SINCE THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT 
THAT COULD BE BECAUSE IN DELIVERING PEACE 
THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT HAS CONSOLIDATED SECTARIAN DIVISIONS 
EVEN TODAY ALL POLITICIANS ELECTED TO STORMONT 
ARE ASKED TO DECLARE THEMSELVES AS UNIONIST NATIONALIST OR OTHER 
OUT OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBERS 
ONLY NINE SAY THEY ARE OTHER 
THERE CLEARLY IS A CARVE UP AND THE QUESTION IS WHEN WILL THAT STOP 
WHERE'S THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP THAT SAYS WE NEED ANOTHER TYPE OF CITIZENSHIP AND SOCIETY 
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE ISSUES OF INTERFACE WALLS AND SECTARIANISM THAT'S SIMPLY NOT COMING OUT 
SO WHAT WE COULD SAY IS THE PEACE PROCESS WAS A MANAGEMENT 
OF SECTARIAN DIFFERENCE AS OPPOSED TO A REMOVAL OF IT 
THIS DECISION TO MANAGE DIFFERENCE AND NOT REMOVE IT 
HAS PRODUCED SOME ABSURD RESULTS' 
SO HERE ON THE CRUMLIN ROAD IN BELFAST 
EACH COMMUNITY ACTUALLY HAS ITS OWN BUS STOP 
YES IT'S ONE OF THE DELIGHTFUL ASPECTS OF A DIVIDED SOCIETY 
THAT BEHIND ME HERE WE HAVE 
THE ONE WHERE THE CATHOLIC AND NATIONALIST POPULATION GET ON THE BUS 
AND JUST ONE HUNDRED YARDS UP HERE ON THE RIGHT WHERE THE PROTESTANT AND UNIONIST PEOPLE GET ON THE SAME BUS 
HOW FAR APART ARE THESE BUS STOPS 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY METRES AND THIS IS THE SAME BUS ROUTE 
THE SAME BUS ROUTE THE SAME BUSES 
IT SEEMS TO BE INSTITUTIONALISING SECTARIAN DIFFERENCE 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IN THAT WHAT WE HAVE IN MANY PARTS OF NORTH BELFAST 
IS EFFECTIVE SOCIAL APARTHEID IT'S SEEN IN THE SMALL THINGS LIKE THESE TWO BUS STOPS 
THE OFFICIAL LINE IS THE EXISTENCE OF TWO ADJACENT BUS STOPS 
IS NOTHING TO DO WITH SEGREGATION 
BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT ON THE GROUND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHERE THEY STAND 
SO HERE ON THE CRUMLIN ROAD IN BELFAST WE STILL HAVE A SITUATION 
WHERE CATHOLICS AND PROTESTANTS HAVE DIFFERENT BUS STOPS FOR THE SAME BUS 
BUT THAT IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW IN MANY PLACES 
SERVICES AND FACILITIES ARE DUPLICATED FOR EACH COMMUNITY 
FROM POST OFFICES TO HEALTH CENTRES BENEFIT OFFICES TO SCHOOLS 
NORTHERN IRELAND SPECIALISES IN DOUBLING UP 
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NEVER TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE 
BEHIND ME IS THE SHANKILL ROAD LEISURE CENTRE 
IT COSTS BELFAST CITY COUNCIL JUST OVER ONE MILLION A YEAR TO RUN 
BUT BECAUSE OF ITS LOCATION IT'S USED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY PROTESTANTS 
JUST ACROSS A PEACE WALL THERE IS ANOTHER LEISURE CENTRE 
OFFERING EXACTLY THE SAME FACILITIES 
THE FALLS ROAD LEISURE CENTRE ALSO COSTS IN THE REGION OF ONE MILLION A YEAR TO RUN 
BUT THIS ONE IS USED BY CATHOLICS 
SO HOW MUCH DOES SEGREGATION COST 
ONE ESTIMATE SAYS THAT PROVIDING DUPLICATE SCHOOL BUSES 
HAS COST TWO POINT FIVE MILLION 
SEGREGATED PUBLIC HOUSING 
TWENTY FOUR MILLION A YEAR 
AND POLICING FOR EVERY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
IT COSTS FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND 
THAT'S TWO AND A HALF TIMES MORE THAN IN ENGLAND AND WALES 
SO IT'S SMALL WONDER THAT THE BRITISH EXCHEQUER SPENDS 
MORE TAX PAYERS' MONEY PER HEAD HERE THAN IT DOES ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE U. K. 
TWO THOUSAND MORE PER HEAD THAN IN ENGLAND 
SEGREGATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS EXPENSIVE FOR EVERYONE IN BRITAIN' 
UNTIL THE CITY ASSEMBLY SAYS WE CANNOT AFFORD TO CONTINUE WITH 
THE SEGREGATED SOCIETY IT DAMAGES US ALL WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD 
HOW CAN YOU HAVE AN ASSEMBLY IN WHICH YOU MAY HAVE TO CUT HEALTH CARE OR SOCIAL SERVICE PROVISION 
BUT YOU STILL CONTINUE TO PAY FOR SEGREGATION TWO LEISURE CENTRES TWO HEALTH CENTRES 
HAVING TO HAVE ONE THING FOR ONE COMMUNITY AND ONE THING FOR THE OTHER 
SO THAT'S THE PRICE OF PEACE BUT THE INVESTMENT DOESN'T END THERE 
WE HAVE THIRTY THOUSAND COMMUNITY WORKERS NOW IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
MORE THAN CIVIL SERVANTS OR SHIPYARD EMPLOYEES 
ANOTHER SEVENTY THOUSAND VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY WORKERS ONE FOR EVERY FIFTEEN PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
I THINK THAT ILLUSTRATES THE ABSURDITY OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH 
OUR POLITICAL PROBLEM HAS TAKEN OVER AND BECOME ALMOST THE CENTRE OF OUR ECONOMY 
OF COURSE MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED IN BRINGING COMMUNITIES TOGETHER 
BUT IT MAY BE THAT REAL SOCIAL CHANGE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
IS DRIVEN NOT BY REACHING OUT BUT BY MOVING UP 
IF YOU WANNA SEE WHAT PROGRESS LOOKS LIKE IN NORTHERN IRELAND AFTER THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT 
YOU NEED TO COME TO A PLACE LIKE THIS 
THIS IS WHERE MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROGRESSED OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS HAVE MOVED TO 
THERE'S BEEN A HUGE POPULATION MOVE TO THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS 
IT IS A GREAT UNTOLD STORY WHEN PEOPLE MOVE TO PLACES LIKE THIS 
THEY DISAPPEAR OUT OF THE SECTARIAN SYSTEM THESE ARE NEUTRAL UNCLAIMED PLACES 
THEY'RE EVEN BUILDING ON PEACE WALLS 
DURING THE TROUBLES THE FORTY F. T. HIGH BARRIER AT DUNCAIRN GARDENS 
TOWERED OVER ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS INTERFACES IN BELFAST 
NOW PART OF IT IS A NEW APARTMENT BLOCK 
THE FIRST VIEWERS HAVE COME TO LOOK AROUND 
AND MARY AND MARGARET LIKE WHAT THEY SEE 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK LOVELY 
SO YOU WOULD CONSIDER LIVING HERE YES I WOULD YEAH 
WOULD YOU HAVE LIVED HERE TEN YEARS AGO 
DEFINITELY NOT NO 
WHY NOT BECAUSE IT WAS JUST TOO DANGEROUS 
THERE WAS TOO MUCH FIGHTING TOO MUCH RIOTING 
AND IT WAS DERELICT EMPTY HOUSES IT WAS JUST SCARY 
WHAT EFFECT DOES A DEVELOPMENT LIKE THIS HAVE ON AN INTERFACE LIKE THIS 
I THINK IT'S GREAT FOR COMMUNITY SPIRIT CROSS COMMUNITY RELATIONS 
YOU HAVE THAT MANY BUSINESSES OPENING UP ALONG THIS ROAD 
YOU HAVE HOUSES NOW THAT PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN THERE IS CONSTANT BUSTLE AND HUSTLE 
PROJECTS LIKE THIS SHOW THAT REAL PROGRESS MIGHT COME NOT FROM DEVOLUTION 
BUT FROM DEVELOPMENT 
NORTHERN IRELAND HAS BEEN ON QUITE A JOURNEY OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS 
THERE HAVE BEEN WRONG TURNINGS AND DEAD ENDS 
BUT MOST PEOPLE HERE AGREE THAT THINGS ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
BUT POLITICIANS WHO HAVE ACHIEVED SO MUCH 
ARE BEING WARNED THAT SOONER OR LATER 
SEGREGATION MUST BE DEALT WITH 
I THINK IF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP HAS SETTLED FOR 
SOMETHING LESS THAN YOU KNOW A REAL TRANSITION OUT OF SEGREGATION 
THEN I THINK THESE COMMUNITIES REMAIN AS INCUBATORS OF DIFFERENCE 
AND REMAIN PLACES WHERE IDENTITIES REMAIN DIFFERENT 
AND IT DOESN'T TAKE A FEW SPARKS TO IGNITE THAT 
DECLAN LAWN THERE BORN BROUGHT UP 
AND NOW REPORTING FOR US IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
WHERE IT SEEMS YOUR ADDRESS 
STILL SAYS MORE ABOUT YOU THAN MAYBE IT SHOULD 
NEXT WEEK THE ECONOMY AND YOU 
DECLAN CURRY REPORTS HOW SOON EVERYONE WILL BE FEELING 
THE EFFECTS OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
THE TARGETS CHANGE THE TERROR DOES NOT 
THE BLOODY HISTORY OF FORTY YEARS OF TERRORISM
