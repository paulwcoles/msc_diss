MAMMOTH EFFORT LAST NIGHT BY THE 
CRUCIBLE CREW 
I OFTEN SAY IF YOU ARE CUEING OFF 
THE CUSHION THE PEOPLE ON THE 
FRONT ROW COULD GRAB YOUR CUE AND 
PLAY THE SHOT FOR YOU THAT IS HOW 
CLOSE YOU ARE BUT THEN WHEN THEY 
TAKE ONE OF THE TABLES AWAY AND YOU 
GET TO THE SEMI FINALS YOU HAVE 
GOT ONE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
CRUCIBLE THEATRE THAT IS WHERE IT 
COMES INTO ITS OWN THE CRUCIBLE 
THIS IS WHERE IT ALL BEGINS THE 
SEMI FINALS ONE TABLE IT IS GOING 
TO BE GREAT L. AM LOOKING FORWARD TO IT

HAPPENS IF I DO ANYTHING CAN 
HAPPEN 
I HAVE PLAYED AT THE MASTERS TWO OR 
THREE TIMES THAT IS A SINGLE TABLE

THAT A WHILE AGO L. ALWAYS WANTED 
TO PLAY IN THE ONE TABLE SET UP L. 
HAVE ACHIEVED THAT L. ALWAYS WANTED 
TO PLAY IT IN A WORLD FINAL SO

TITLE NINE YEARS AFTER HE WON HIS 
SEVENTH 
ONCE YOU GET TO 
THE SEMI FINAL SEVENTH THE SECOND HALF OF THE TOURNAMENT 
BEGINS THERE IS SO MUCH SNOOKER 
STILL TO BE PLAYED A THIRTY THREE FRAME 
MATCH AND THIRTY FIVE FRAME MATCH ALMOST AS

PATRICK KIELTY 
WE HEAR FROM I 
REMEMBER RAY REARDON AND POT BLACK 
I REMEMBER SITTING WITH MY MUM AND 
DAD WATCHING POT BLACK THAT IS ONE 
OF MY EARLIEST SNOOKER MEMORIES TO 
STOP WE ARE AT SHEFFIELD STATION 
AGAIN FOR ANOTHER COACHING 
CONFERENCE WITH MR. PARROTT AND MR. 
SELBY SELBY AND AND IT IS JOHN VIRGO'S TURN TO 
SETTLE INTO THE MASTERMIND HOT SEAT 
VICTORS BELLETTI ONCE GAVE YOU 
ADVICE ABOUT CHEESE WHAT WAS THAT 
DON'T EAT IT BEFORE YOU GO ON 
STAGE WHY STAGE WHY DAIRY PRODUCTS RONNIE STAGE WHY RONNIE AND STEPHEN ARGUE OUT HERE AT TWO P. M. 
WE WILL BE LIVE FOR THE OPENING 
SESSION IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE 
ABOUT TO SEE WHO IS CROWNED JUNIOR 
POT BLACK CHAMPION LAST YEAR IN 
THE CUE ZONE WE HAD EIGHT OF THE 
BEST YOUNG PLAYERS IN THE COUNTRY 
AGED FIFTEEN OR UNDER THEY BATTLED 
THROUGH THEIR QUARTERS AND SEMIS 
THE REWARD ON OFFER WAS QUITE 
PRIZE ONE FRAME SHOOT OUT INSIDE 
THE CRUCIBLE ARENA LET'S MEET THE 
FINALISTS 
WHEN I WAS HERE LAST YEAR I DIDN'T 
GET TO THE CRUCIBLE STAGES L. HAVE 
BEEN PRACTISING ON MY OWN TRYING 
TO GET TO THE FINAL 
IT MEANS 
EVERYTHING IT IS NOT THE LAST TIME 
WE ARE HERE 
I FINISHED NUMBER ONE 
IN THE WELSH UNDER SIXTEENS THIS 
YEAR I HAVE NEVER FINISHED THERE 
BEFORE I WAS NO TOOK THE LAST TWO 
YEARS 
I WAS NUMBER SIXTEEN CHAMPION IN YEARS TWO THOUSAND SIX AND IRISH UNDER FOURTEEN CHAMPION 
IT IS A BIG IMPROVEMENT 
I HAVE GOT 
A GOOD ALL ROUND GAME SOLID SAFETY 
HOPEFULLY I CAN SCORE A BIT THAT 
IS THE PERFECT PLAYER MORE MORE ATTACKING UNDER PRESSURE I WOULD 
LIKE TO PLAY MORE SAFETY THAN 
ATTACKING 
IN JUNIOR POT BLACK IT ATTACKING HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN WON BY JOHN 
PARROTT TWICE AND STEPHEN HENDRY 
GOT TO THE SEMI FINAL THERE IS A 
LOT OF PRESTIGE IN IT 
IT WOULD BE 
GREAT TO DATE IN THE CRUCIBLE AS AS WE PICK THEM UP IT HAS BEEN A 
NERVOUS AND INTENSE START DEVANEY 
IS LEADING BY THIRTY SEVEN TO TWENTY THREE AS WE GET INTO 
THIS ONE FRAME SHOOT OUT CLIVE 
EVERTON IS CALLING THE SHOTS 
GOOD SAFETY THAT FROM JASON 
DEVANEY THE IRISH UNDER SIXTEEN 
CHAMPION WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED A 
PRETTY TIGHT TACTICAL GAME IN THIS 
ONE FRAME FINAL OF JUNIOR POT BLACK 
A PROBLEM THIS FOR JONES IF HE 
HITS THE RED ON ONE SIDE IT COULD 
CONTACT THE YELLOW IF HE GOES 
ACROSS IT THE OTHER WAY DOUBLING 
IT BACK DOWN THE TABLE IS AN 
OBVIOUS POSSIBILITY FOUR GOING INTO 
THE BROWN 
IN THE END CAUGHT IT HALF BALL 
BUT NOT TOO BAD THE RED CANNONS 
THE GREEN IT IS NOT LEFT IN THE 
POTTABLE POSITION 
DEVANEY PLAYED IN THE EUROPEAN 
UNDER NINETEEN CHAMPIONSHIP LAST MONTH 
AND LOST IN THE LAST THIRTY TWO BUT GOT 
OUT OF HIS GROUP 
JONES THE LAST WELSH UNDER FOURTEEN 
CHAMPION LAST YEAR AND TOP OF THE 
WELSH UNDER SIXTEEN RANKINGS AT THE 
MOMENT HE COMES FROM MOUNTAIN ASH 
MOUNTAIN ASH ANYBODY WHO HAS 
EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN WELSH SNOOKER 
KNOWS THAT WAS THE HOME OF WE ORIEL 
WHO WON THE WELSH AMATEUR BILLIARDS 
CHAMPIONSHIP A RECORD NUMBER OF 
TIMES ROY THE ORIEL 
THAT WAS GOOD THINKING BY JONES 
TRYING TO DEVELOP THE GREEN AS HE 
POTTED THE YELLOW FROM THE LAST RED 
JONES HAS HAD SOME COACHING FROM 
DARREN MORGAN WHO OF COURSE 
REACHED THE SEMI FINALS HERE ONE 
YEAR AND IS NOW INSTALLED AS THE 
OWNER OF THE RED TRIANGLE CLUB IN 
CROSS KEYS YES DECENT SAFETY FROM JONES 
THIS HAS BEEN A LONG FRAME IT HAS 
ALREADY BEEN IN PROGRESS FOR SOME 
FORTY MINUTES THE BALLS HAVE RAN 
AWKWARDLY HAVE RUN ALSO BOTH 
PLAYERS HAVE FOUND THE SPEED OF THE 
TABLE AND ITS RESPONSIVENESS 
DIFFICULT TO CONTROL NOT 
SURPRISING REALLY NEITHER THEM 
NEITHER OF THEM WOULD EVER HAVE 
PLAYED ON THE TABLE LIKE THIS 
ALTHOUGH DEVANEY HAS PLAYED ANOTHER 
SHREWD SAFETY THERE 
SWERVE FROM JONES WELL A BIT 
UNLUCKY IF HE COULD HAVE HIT THE 
GREEN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LEAGUE HE 
MIGHT HAVE LEFT DO THEY NEED 
SNOOKERED DEVANEY SNOOKERED 
MEANT TO GET BEHIND THE PINK RATHER 
THAN CANNON IT 
IT IS ALWAYS INTERESTING SEEING 
PLAYERS LIKE THIS AT THE START OF 
THEIR CAREERS THEN WATCHING THEM 
BLOSSOM 
IN FACT DEVANEY LOST IN THE LAST 
THIRTY TWO OF THE EUROPEAN UNDER NINETEEN 
CHAMPIONSHIP TO ANTHONY MACGILL 
WHO WAS RUNNER UP HERE A COUPLE OF 
YEARS AGO MACGILL REACHED THE 
EUROPEAN JUNIOR FINAL MAKING FOUR 
CENTURIES DURING THE TOURNAMENT 
HE LOST TO STEPHEN CRAIGIE OF 
NEWCASTLE FOR THE TITLE 
NOW THAT REALLY WAS GOOD NO ONE 
COULD HAVE PLAYED THAT BETTER HE 
REALLY DOES HAVE A GOOD TACTICAL 
GAME USUALLY WITH YOUNG PLAYERS 
THEY START OUT AS GREAT POTTERS AND 
LEARNED THE TACTICS LEARN THE 
TACTICS BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE A 
PRETTY GOOD GRASP OF THE TACTICAL 
GAME ALREADY 
WITH THE MISS RULE IN OPERATION HE 
REALLY NEEDED TO HIT THAT FIRST 
TIME 
DEVANEY HAS A CHOICE HE CAN GO FOR 
BROWN AS FRAME BALL OR HE CAN PUT 
JONES IN AGAIN PROBABLY THE 
PERCENTAGE DECISION BROWN WAS 
POTTABLE BUT IT WAS FROM DISTANCE 
AND QUITE A BIT OF PRESSURE ON IT 
IT WAS MATCH BALL FOR HIM AFTER 
ALL JONES IS NOT GOING TO DO MUCH 
FROM BEHIND THE BLACK FOUL AND A MISS 
PRETTY WELL CARBON COPY OF THE 
FIRST SHOT HIS FIRST ESCAPE 
ATTEMPT A CARBON COPY ANNE 
MARIE RILEY IS THE REFEREE QUITE A 
FEW LEADING REFEREES COMING INTO 
THE GAME MICHAELA TABB OF COURSE 
THE BEST KNOWN LADY REFEREES 
THERE IS MOLLY NEWBOLD AS WELL 
A BIT MORE LEFT OF CENTRE STRIKING 
AND THIS TIME JONES HAS HIT THE 
BROWN JUST AS WELL IF HE HADN'T 
HE WOULD HAVE NEEDED A SNOOKER 
AGAIN DEVANEY TRYING TO TURN THE 
SCREW THIS TIME HE HASN'T GOT THE 
CUE BALL QUITE BEHIND THE PINK AND 
BLACK 
THE BROWN POTTABLE JUST OFF 
STRAIGHT AS I SAY THOUGH THE 
BROWN WILL LOOK A VERY LONG WAY 
AWAY TO JONES FAR ENOUGH OFF 
STRAIGHT TO RUN THE CUE BALL ROUND 
FOR POSITION ON PINK 
DARREN MORGAN HIS COACH IS VERY 
TAKEN WITH THIS YOUNG MAN'S 
TECHNIQUE AND GENERAL ATTITUDE TO 
THE GAME 
WELL INSTEAD OF TRYING TO RUN THE 
CUE BALL ROUND HE RAISED THE BUTT 
OF THE CUE AND ATTEMPTED TO STUN 
THE BROWN IN AT LEAST HE HAS LEFT 
IT AT DISTANCE 
BUT THAT WAS A GOOD POT FROM 
DISTANCE THE BEST OF KISS IS AS 
WELL KISSES 
DEVANEY HAS SHOWN NOT ONLY A PRETTY 
GOOD TACTICAL GAME BUT THE ABILITY 
TO POT THE VITAL BALL 
TWENTY NINE IN FRONT ONLY THIRTEEN ON THE TABLE 
JASON DEVANEY IS GOING TO BE JUNIOR 
POT BLACK CHAMPION 
JONES PLAYED ON BUT TO NO AVAIL 
SIXTY THREE TO TWENTY EIGHT WAS THE FINAL SCORE IT SEEMS 
APPROPRIATE AN IRISHMAN CLAIMS THE 
TITLE IN THE SAME SENIOR THAT 
SEASON THAT KEN DOHERTY CLAIMED THE 
SENIOR TITLE WHO KNOWS HE MIGHT 
WIN A WORLD TITLE ONE DAY JONES IS 
ONLY FOURTEEN HE WILL BE BACK DEVANEY 
IS THE CHAMPION WELL DONE YOUNG 
FELLOW FELLOW IT WAS A BIG DAY FOR BOTH OF THOSE 
YOUNG LADS THE FIFTY MINUTE FRAME IT 
WAS REALLY TENSE 
IT IS TOUGH TO 
GET USED TO SUCH A FAST TABLE 
QUICKLY BEST OF THREE OR FIVE 
THEY COULD HAVE MADE A BIG BREAK 
BUT ONE FRAME SHOOT OUT IS WHAT POT 
BLACK IS ABOUT IT IS GOOD TO SEE A 
GINGER WE COULD HAVE ANOTHER 
GINGER DOMINATION OF WORLD SNOOKER 
HEAVEN HELP US WHAT ABOUT AN 
IRISHMAN HE DOES NOT BEEN THE BEST 
OF CHAMPIONSHIPS FOR THE IRISH WAS 
UP IT HASN'T WITH KEN AND MARCUS 
ALLEN BEING BEATEN GREAT GREAT EXPERIENCE JUST WALKING INTO THAT 
ARENA MAYBE BEST OF THREE MIGHT 
HAVE SEEN THEM IN A BETTER LIGHT 
THE CONDITIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO GET 
USED TO 
HE IS ONLY FOURTEEN I'M SURE HE 
WILL BE BACK GOOD LUCK TO BOTH OF 
THEM WE ARE BUILDING UP TO THE 
START OF THE SEMI FINAL IN FIVE OR 
SIX MINUTES BEFORE THAT A QUICK 
CHECK ON THE COACHING TIPS DOWN AT 
THE TRAINING STATION WITH MR. 
PARROTT AND MR. SELBY 
HERE IS A BUDDING YOUNG SNOOKER 
PLAYER WELCOME TO THE SNOOKER 
ACADEMY WHAT IS YOUR NAME HIGHEST 
BREAK YESTERDAY WHAT WAS IT ONE HUNDRED FOUR 
HOW OLD ARE YOU ELEVEN 
THAT IS ELEVEN FANTASTIC YOU ARE WELL AHEAD OF 
SCHEDULE YOU HAVE QUESTION FOR 
MARK 
I AM NOT REALLY GOOD WITH THE MARK REST 
RIGHT O. K. 
YOU WILL BE USING REST THE REST A LOT BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT 
THAT TALL THE BEST WAY TO DO IT 
THE TEXTBOOK WAY IS WITH THIS PART 
OF YOUR ARM BEEN AS PARALLEL AS 
POSSIBLE YOU DON'T WANT IT THERE 
ARE ALL THERE AS PARALLEL AS 
POSSIBLE WHEN YOU PUSH THROUGH 
YOU WANT TO PUSH THROUGH NICE AND 
STRAIGHT 
ANOTHER THING TO REMEMBER STRAIGHT WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING WITH THE REST 
ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF 
CUE OVER THE REST HEAD YOU DON'T 
WANT TO START WITH THE CUE TIP 
THERE WHEN IT COMES BACK STRAIGHT 
OFF MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY 
THERE COME BACK PAUSE I IS ON 
THE OBJECT BALL THEN YOU GO 
THROUGH WATCH HOW MARK PLAYS IT 
SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BRIDGE HE HAS 
GOT THROUGH RIGHT VERY GOOD 
ANOTHER ONE FOR YOU 
IS THAT ALRIGHT O. K. KEEP YOUR ARM 
PARALLEL VERY GOOD RIGHT I'M 
GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE TIP ONE 
THING I CAN TEACH YOU STRAIGHT AWAY 
YOUR TIP IS TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE 
CUE BALL TO START WITH MAKE SURE 
YOU GET YOUR TIP UP TO THE WHITE 
WHAT YOU HAVE GOT THERE IS YOU HAVE 
GOT IT WAY AWAY FROM THE WHITE GET 
YOUR TIP UP TO THE WHITE PAUL YOUR 
REST BACK AND GET YOUR TIP UP TO 
THE WHITE STOP NOW START TAKING 
YOUR WAGGLES BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS 
THAT IS A GOOD STRIKE A BETTER 
STRIDE 
MORE SOLID 
YOU CAN STILL STRIDE GET UP TO THE WHITE MORE 
KEEP IT 
WHERE IT IS BUT PUSH YOUR CUE 
FURTHER YOU ARE NOT GIVING 
YOURSELF ENOUGH CUE KEEP THE REST 
WHERE IT IS AND PUSH YOUR CUE 
FURTHER FORWARD 
THAT IS YOUR 
STARTING POSITION GET IT THERE 
AGAIN NOW COME BACK DON'T BE 
FRIGHTENED OF COMING BACK AND GOING 
THROUGH NEARLY NEARLY TRY AGAIN 
OR YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT HERE IS 
TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE BALL 
SMOOTH AND STRAIGHT VERY GOOD 
THAT IS BETTER REMEMBER THAT ARM 
PARALLEL GIVE YOURSELF PLENTY OF 
CUE COMEBACK NICE AND SMOOTH IF 
NOT IN A HURRY GET YOUR EYES ON 
THE OBJECT BALL AND HAS MOVED STRIP 
YES 
PRACTISING SMOOTH YES KEEP PRACTISING SMOOTH STRIKE 
I WILL BE PLAYING HIM IN A STRIKE FEW YEARS 
DEFINITELY TOP COACHING TIPS THIS 
TIME FROM YOUNG JOHN PERHAPS WE 
WILL BE SEEING HIM IN A FEW YEARS 
HE WAS THAT GOOD 
ONE HUNDRED BREAK AT ELEVEN 
FANTASTIC 
PERHAPS A FUTURE FANTASTIC CHAMPION BUT WE ARE CONCENTRATING 
ON THIS YEAR'S CHAMPIONSHIP SEMI 
FINALS AND IT IS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
TARGETING THE THIRD WORLD TITLE 
HIS OPPONENT STEPHEN HENDRY IS 
STILL CONVINCED HE CAN WEAR THE 
CRUCIBLE CROWN FOR THE EIGHTH TIME 
IT MEANT MORE THAN THE OTHER SIX 
TOGETHER A SEVENTH WORLD TITLE I WILL 
ALWAYS REMEMBER AS MY BIGGEST 
ACHIEVEMENT AND MY GREATEST 
ACHIEVEMENT IN SNOOKER A HUGE 
DISAPPOINTMENT TO LOSE IN THE FINAL 
FRAME IT IS PROBABLY MY BIGGEST 
DISAPPOINTMENT IN SNOOKER LOSING 
THAT FINAL PETER IS FANTASTIC 
PLAYER AND NOW HE IS MUCH BETTER 
THAN HE WAS THEN L. JUST DIDN'T 
BELIEVE HE COULD POSSIBLY BEAT ME 
OVER TWO DAYS 
IF YOU LET RONNIE GET BULLIED ON 
YOU YOU WILL STRUGGLE TO PEG HIM 
BACK GET A LEAD ON YOU HE IS 
THE BEST FRONT RUNNER IN THE GAME 
IT WAS JUST BAD MATCH MORE LESS 
FROM START TO FINISH FOR ME 
WOULD NOT SAY THAT IS THE CAUSE OF 
MY SORT OF DEMISE OVER THE LAST TWO 
OR THREE YEARS AT THE CRUCIBLE IT 
HAS JUST BEEN DOWN TO BAD PLAYED 
AND ONE OR TWO TECHNICAL THINGS ARE 
BAD PLAY 
OF COURSE I AM THINKING ABOUT 
WINNING IT THAT IS WHAT I AM HERE 
TO DO L. AM NOT HERE TO FINISH 
SECOND IT IS THE ONLY REASON I AM 
IN SHEFFIELD TO WIN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
TWICE THE WINNER HERE IN SHEFFIELD 
BLINK AND YOU HAVE MISSED HIM HERE 
COMES THE ROCKET RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN O'SULLIVAN O'SULLIVAN IS ONE OF THOSE PLAYERS 
TO BEAT O'SULLIVAN YOU HAD EVERY 
CHANCE OF WINNING THE TOURNAMENT 
IF YOU BEAT O'SULLIVAN 
THE GAME 
NEEDS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN BECAUSE IT 
IS THE MOST EXCITING AND NATURALLY 
GIFTED PLAYER WE'VE EVER HAD THE THE QUESTION HAS ALWAYS BEEN HOW MUCH 
OF IT HE CAN PRODUCE UNDER PRESSURE 
WHAT A FANTASTIC MAXIMUM BREAK THAT 
IS UNBELIEVABLE 
I DON'T THINK I 
HAVE EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
BEFORE OR SINCE FIVE MINUTES TWENTY 
SECONDS IT LOOKED AS IF HE DIDN'T 
HAVE A CARE IN THE WORLD AND WAS 
COMPLETELY IMMUNE TO PRESSURE ONE 
OF THE GREATEST BREAKS OF ALL TIME 
O'SULLIVAN HAD A PROBLEM IN 
DELIVERING ON HIS IMMENSE TALENT 
AND WHEN HE DIDN'T WIN AT HIS 
FIRST FEW ATTEMPTS IT GOT TO BE 
QUITE A BURDEN FOR HIM HE HAS 
ADMITTED IN HIS BOOK THAT IN TWO THOUSAND ONE 
HE ALMOST DIDN'T GET TO THE 
STARTING LINE AND WOULDN'T HAVE 
DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR BEING 
PRESCRIBED PROZAC 
OVER THE YEARS 
O'SULLIVAN AND HENDRY HAVE HAD A 
BIT OF RIVALRY SOMETIMES IT WENT 
OVER THE TOP BITTER RIVALRY 
DEEP DOWN IT IS LIKE ANY FOOD BALL 
OR BOXER WOULD DO BEFORE THEY WENT 
OUT TO BATTLE THE WORDS THEY HAD 
WHILE THAT MAY BE JUST SIMPLY PAR 
FOR THE COURSE CERTAINLY NOT IN 
SNOOKER 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IT 
IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE ALEX 
HIGGINS HIT ERA WHEN YOU KNEW YOU 
WOULD WATCH A GREAT PLAYER BUT SHE 
DID NOT KNOW IF HE WAS GOING TO 
HAVE A TANTRUM OR WALKOUT 
WHEN I 
HAVE SPOKEN TO RUN A HE IS AN 
ABSOLUTE GENTLEMAN THE ISSUE WITH 
RONNIE IS HIMSELF NO QUESTION 
ABOUT THAT SPOKEN TO RUN 
THE EBDON WAS NOT CHEATING HE WAS 
PLAYING AT HIS OWN SPEED RONNIE RONNIE HAS HIS OWN DEMONS TO PUT UP WITH 
AT TIMES WHEN HE IS RIGHT HE IS 
UNDOUBTEDLY THE GREATEST PLAYER TO 
WATCH 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY THAT YEAR 
RONNIE'S HEAD HAD JUST GONE A 
LITTLE BIT BECAUSE FOR SOMEBODY TO 
CHANGE THE TIP THAT AMOUNT OF TIMES 
THAT IS ANOTHER RECORD THAT RONNIE 
WILL HOLD THAT WILL NEVER BE BEATEN 
CLEARLY HIS MIND WAS NOT RIGHT AND 
HE WAS BEATEN BY GRAEME DOTT AFTER 
THE MATCH HE GAVE HIS CUE A WAY TO 
A YOUNG LAD IN THE FRONT ROW 
THINK HE MAKES THE GAME VERY 
INTERESTING 
THE BOOKS SHOW THAT INTERESTING GRAEME DOTT BEAT HIM BUT IN EFFECT 
O'SULLIVAN BEAT HIMSELF 
IT DOES NOT SUIT HIM AT THE 
CRUCIBLE OVER SEVENTEEN DAYS IF IT WAS 
EIGHT TOURNAMENT OVER A WEEK HE 
WOULD WIN IT EVERY TIME 
A DON'T 
THINK HE LIKES BEING AWAY FROM HOME 
FOR A LONG TIME I DON'T THINK 
THESE TWO WEEKS ARE DEFINITELY 
TESTING FOR HIM HE HAS DONE IT 
ONE WIRD GENIUS QUITE SPECTACULAR 
STUFF FROM O'SULLIVAN ONE WORD 
THE OTHER ON PLAYERS MIGHT AS WELL 
THINK THEY SHOULD PACK UP AND GO 
HOME HOME NO ONE IS MORE EXPERIENCED AT THE 
CRUCIBLE THAN STEPHEN HENDRY HE 
SURVIVED A NAIL BITER IN THE FIRST 
ROUND HE RACED AWAY FROM DING 
JUNHUI AND RYAN DAY IN THE QUARTER 
FINAL THIS IS HIS TWELFTH SEMI FINAL 
IN TWENTY THREE YEARS RONNIE'S PROGRESS HAS 
BEEN LARGELY UNTROUBLED HE THREW 
IN A MAXIMUM TO SEE OFF MARK 
WILLIAMS AND THEN PRESSED THE 
ACCELERATOR TO BEAT LIANG WENBO A 
REMINDER OF THE OTHER SEMI 
FINALISTS 
RIGHT NOW WE ARE ALL SET FOR THE 
ENTRANCE OF STEPHEN AND RONNIE THE 
LAST TIME THEY PLAYED IN A RANKING 
EVENT RONNIE WALKED OUT HALFWAY 
THROUGH THEIR OPENING SESSION THE 
ONLY WALKING OUT THEY WILL BE DOING 
TODAY IS INTO THAT CRUCIBLE ARENA 
GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN ONE TABLE TODAY AND THAT 
MEANS IT IS SEMI FINAL TIME THE 
PLAYERS WE HAVE WAITING BACKSTAGE 
ARE LEGENDS OF THE GAME EIGHTEEN WORLD 
AND U. K. TITLES BETWEEN THEM AND THIS 
WILL BE THEIR FOURTH CRUCIBLE SEMI 
FINAL WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ADO 
LET'S GET THE BOYS ON THE BAIZE 
INTRODUCING FIRSTLY WINNER OF AN 
OUTRAGEOUS THIRTY SIX RANKING EVENT TITLES 
SEVEN TIMES A CHAMPION OF THE WORLD 
MAKING HIS TWELFTH APPEARANCE IN THE 
SEMI FINALS THE UNDISPUTED KING OF 
THE CRUCIBLE STEPHEN HENDRY 
HIS OPPONENT THE MOST NATURALLY 
GIFTED PLAYER EVER TO GRACE THE 
GAME A SENSATIONAL ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN ON MONDAY 
MAKING HIS EIGHTH APPEARANCE IN THE 
SEMI FINALS THE TWO TIME WORLD 
CHAMPION BLINK AND YOU HAVE MISSED 
HIM BECAUSE HE COMES THE ROCKET 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
HERE WE GO THE FIFTIETH PROFESSIONAL 
ENCOUNTER BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN 
THE SEMI FINALS ARE BEST OF THIRTY THREE 
FRAMES SEVENTEEN IS THE NUMBER THEY ARE 
AIMING FOR DENNIS TAYLOR AND CLIVE 
EVERTON HAVE TEAMED UP IN THE 
COMMENTARY BOX OUT IN THE ARENA 
WE ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO 
THIS HAZEL WE DID NOT THINK WE 
WOULD SEE THESE TWO IN THE SEMI 
FINAL BUT STEPHEN HENDRY HAS DONE 
REMARKABLY WELL AND I JUST HOPE IT 
IS A CLASSIC CLIVE 
HENDRY KING 
OF THE NINETIES IT MUST BE A GREAT 
FINAL FOR HIM TO BE IN CONTENTION 
AGAIN FOR THE TITLE 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN SNOOKER'S 
GREATEST AND SOMEWHAT UNFULFILLED 
GENIUS IT IS SOME ACHIEVEMENT TO 
WIN THE WORLD TITLE TWICE 
O'SULLIVAN IT IS SO EXCEPTIONAL 
ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED WITH ALL 
THAT ABILITY FOR HIM TO WIN IT 
EVEN MORE PERHAPS HE WILL THIS 
YEAR 
THE QUESTION THAT YOU ALWAYS GET 
ASKED AS YOU TRAVEL AROUND THE 
COUNTRY WHO IS THE GREATEST PLAYER 
EVER TO PLAY THE GAME OF SNOOKER L. L. 
ALWAYS SAY THAT STEPHEN HENDRY IS 
THE GREATEST PLAYER THAT HAS EVER 
PLAYED THE GAME RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
COULD GO WANT TO OVERTAKE STEPHEN 
BUT HE HAS TO WIN A FEW MORE TITLES 
FUNNILY ENOUGH DENNIS O'SULLIVAN 
WAS ASKED A VERY SIMILAR QUESTION 
TO THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER HE HAD 
WON THE U. K. CHAMPIONSHIP FOR THE 
FOURTH TIME HE SAID IT IS GETTING 
A BIT LATE I HAVE NOT GOT LONG AT 
THE AGE OF THIRTY TWO IT SEEMS A STRANGE 
THING TO SAY BUT THE FACT IS THAT 
NOBODY OVER THE AGE OF THIRTY ONE HAUT THE 
LA GARENNE WON THIS TITLE SINCE 
NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX HAS WON THIS TITLE 
HE CERTAINLY IS THE MOST NATURALLY 
GIFTED PLAYER WE HAVE EVER HAD IN 
THE GAME 
THE POP SUCCESS RATE IS PRETTY GOOD 
POT THAT IS VERY CONSISTENT 
NOW WHAT ABOUT SAFETY 
O'SULLIVAN 
THOSE ARE THE PERCENTAGES WHICH 
DENOTE HOW OFTEN THEY HAVE MANAGED 
TO PREVENT THEIR OPPONENT POTTING A 
BALL IN THE NEXT SHOT 
I THINK THAT WILL BE THE KEY PARTS 
TO THIS MATCH THE LONG POTTING 
WHO CAN KNOCKIN MORE LONG POTS 
KNOCK IN KEY STEPHEN HAS ADMITTED 
HE'S BEEN PLAYING A BIT MORE PAY 
SAFETY THAN HE NORMALLY LIKES TO DO 
HE WAS VERY RELUCTANT FOR TWO OR 
THREE SEASONS TO CHANGE HIS GAME 
AT THE MARGINS THERE ARE SOME 
SHOTS YOU ALWAYS GO FOR AN SOME 
SHOTS YOU ALWAYS REFUSE THE ONES 
IN BETWEEN HE TENDED TO GO FOR 
RATHER THAN REFUSE HE HAS ALTERED 
THAT BALANCE SLIGHTLY 
THIS IS A TOUGH SHOT HE HAS 
SPOTTED SOMETHING ON THE WHITE IT 
IS THE TYPE OF SHOT HE WAS MISSING 
EARLY ON IN THE TOURNAMENT IN THE 
QUARTER FINAL HE STARTED KNOCKING 
IN THIS TYPE OF SHOT IF HE TRIES 
TO HOLD FOR THE BLACK HE HAS TO 
PUT IT OR HE PUTS IT STEPHEN IN THE 
BALLS THIS IS WHY HE IS GIVING 
HIMSELF MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT 
THIS THIS IS WHAT HE IS FACED WITH 
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PLAY IT AND GET 
BACK IN THE TABLE BACK UP THE 
TABLE BUT HE COULD EASILY CAN AND 
THE REDS CANNON HE PLAYED 
POOR SAFETY SHOT 
CAN YOU 
PLEASE TURN DOWN THE VOLUME ON YOUR 
E. PEARCE'S EARPIECES MICHAELA MICHAELA TABB ASKING THE AUDIENCE TO TURN 
DOWN THE VOLUME ON THEIR EARPIECES 
THROUGH WHICH THE AUDIENCE CAN HEAR 
THE COMMENTARY FROM DENNIS AND 
MYSELF 
RONNIE PURPOSELY REFUSED THE LONG 
POT THERE HE PLAYED POOR SAFETY 
SHOT THAT WILL HURT HIM LITTLE THAT A LITTLE BIT 
IN THE BUILD UP TO THIS MATCH 
HENDRY EMPHASISED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
NOT ALLOWING O'SULLIVAN TO GET IN 
FRONT 
HE CORRECTLY DESCRIBED HIM AS A 
GREAT FRONT RUNNER ALTHOUGH THIS 
MATCH IS THE BEST OF THIRTY THREE SPREAD 
OVER FOUR SESSIONS A GOOD START IS 
STILL VERY IMPORTANT 
THREE REDS THREE BLACKS BUT HE 
WILL NOT BE THINKING OF THE CHANCE 
OF A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN AS HE MIGHT BE IF HE WERE 
SEVERAL FRAMES IN FRONT 
I MIGHT HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH YOU 
RONNIE HAS GONE ONE AHEAD OF HIM 
HE HAS MADE NINE MAXIMUM BREAKS TO 
STEPHEN'S EIGHT 
I DON'T THINK HE WILL STRAIN IF 
THERE IS POSSIBILITY OF NOT DOING ENOUGH TO SECURE THE FRAME 
IF HE GOT TO SEVENTY THREE WON ALL REDS AND 
BLACKS THEN WE WOULD SEE A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
ATTEMPT 
WE WILL FIND OUT WITH THIS SHOT 
WHAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE SO EASY TO 
DROP THIS IN AND FINISH ON THE BLUE 
HE HAS FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE MAXIMUM 
AND POSSIBLE THIRD SHARE OF 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND IT IS CURRENTLY DIVIDED 
BETWEEN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AND ALI 
CARTER 
HE NEEDS A GOOD CAN AND HERE IF HE 
COULD HIT THE LEFT OF THE TWO REDS 
AT THE BACK OF THE BUNCH IT WOULD 
BE BETTER 
IT HAS TURNED OUT O. K. THERE IS ONE 
TO THE MIDDLE POCKET 
THIS BREAK A RISING FROM AN 
O'SULLIVAN SAFETY MISTAKE FAILING 
TO THREAD THE CUE BALL AROUND THE 
SECOND RED 
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT STEPHEN HENDRY 
DID IN THE NINETIES WHEN HE WAS 
DOMINATING THE GAME FIRST FRAME 
HE ALWAYS SEEMED TO GET A VERY GOOD 
START ONLY THE RED NEEDED 
WELL WHAT A START TO THIS SEMI 
FINAL WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF BOTH 
PLAYERS COULD PLAY AT THE TOP OF 
THEIR FORMER THEIR FORM NO 
DISTRACTIONS NOW THE CRUCIBLE 
THEATRE ALL TO THEMSELVES THIS IS 
WHEN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP REALLY 
STARTS FOR A LOT OF THE TOP PLAYERS 
WELL WE DO CALL IT THE THEATRE OF 
DREAMS AS YOU SAID CLIVE 
SOMETIMES NIGHTMARES 
IT IS CERTAINLY A DREAM START FOR 
HENDRY 
CENTURY NUMBER SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTEEN SURELY COMING UP 
FOR HENDRY STILL NEARLY TWO HUNDRED IN 
FRONT OF O'SULLIVAN IN THAT 
DEPARTMENT HE HAS FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE 
HIS CUEING IN THIS OPENING FRAME 
HAS BEEN SUPERB VERY VERY SMOOTH 
VERY FLUENT WATCH THIS SIDE THAT 
IS TO SWING IT UP PAST THE BLUE 
HAS IT GOT THERE JUST ABOUT 
HENDRY HAS BUILT HIMSELF UP 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY FOR THIS MATCH 
HE HAS COME OUT OF THE TRAPS LIKE A 
GREYHOUND 
O'SULLIVAN MISJUDGED THE SAFETY AND 
FROM THAT HENDRY COMPILED A 
SUBLIME CLEARANCE TO TAKE THE 
OPENING FRAME 
WELL THERE IS NICE LOW KEY 
START TO THE SEMI FINAL 
ABSOLUTELY CRACKING START THIS IS 
THE FIFTY SECOND CENTURY OF THIS PARTICULAR 
CHAMPIONSHIP THE RECORD IS SIXTY EIGHT LAST 
YEAR ALSO IN TWO THOUSAND TWO WE HAVE A LONG 
WAY TO GO TO TRY AND BEAT THAT BUT 
I WONDER WHETHER YOU THINK IT IS 
POSSIBLE TO DO THAT 
IF THE PLAYERS 
TAKE OFF IN THEIR SESSIONS AND MORE 
HUNDRED BREAKS ARE BEING MADE IT 
IS A POSSIBILITY L. THINK THE 
STANDARD OF SNOOKER HAS BEEN 
EXCELLENT IN THIS TOURNAMENT SO FAR 
REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF BREAKS 
PUT IN CONTEXT THAT START FROM 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
ABSOLUTELY WHAT HE 
WANTS HE HAS PLAYED RONNIE FIFTY 
TIMES YOU HAVE TO GET A GOOD START 
AGAINST THE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN THE 
LAST TIME THEY PLAYED WHEN RONNIE 
WALKED OUT STEPHEN WAS LEADING FIVE TO ONE 
HE KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD 
START HE HAS TO GET IN FRONT OF 
HIM TO MAKING THINK ABOUT IT ONE 
THING YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE HIS 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN WORKING WALKING 
AWAY FROM YOU 
STEPHEN SAID HE HAD 
NOT HIT TOP FORM THIS YEAR HE 
COULD BE COMING INTO IT 
I DISAGREE 
THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD PLAYERS 
AROUND THE WAY HE PUT PAID TO DING 
JUNHUI'S CHANCES SUPERB PLAYER HE HE IS PLAYING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
GAME AS WELL HE STARTED WITH A 
CENTURY TODAY BUT HE HAS PLAYED 
MORE SAFETY THINKING ABOUT IT A 
BIT MORE SOMETIMES THE MATCH PLAY 
IS BETTER EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT 
POTTING AS MANY BALLS 
SAFETY IS 
OVERRATED THAT IS WHAT HE SAID L. 
SUSPECT THINGS COULD CHANGE AGAINST 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN THIS IS FRAMED 
TWO 
HENDRY HAS WON FORTY THAT WAS HIS 
FOURTH HIGHEST BREAK AT THE 
CRUCIBLE ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
I GOT THAT THE WRONG WAY ROUND HE 
HAS GOT ONE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN AND TWO ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONES 
RONNIE HAS MADE THE MISTAKE AGAIN 
HE HAS LET STEPHEN HENDRY IN A 
ROUND THE BLACK SPOT AROUND THE 
BLACK SPOT 
HE WAS NOT SNOOKERED RONNIE BUT 
HE MISJUDGED THE ESCAPE OF THE SIDE 
CUSHION OFF 
I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN MANAGE TO 
FIND A 
LITTLE GAP WITH DELICATE LITTLE SHOT TO HOLD FOR THE BLACK 
THE PINK AND BLUE ARE AVAILABLE 
THOUGH IF HE ROLLS SIT IN HE 
MIGHT JUST HIT THE BLACK AND 
ROLLS IT IN HE WILL HAVE TO BE 
VERY PRECISE THOUGH NOT BAD 
O'SULLIVAN HAS MADE TWO SAFETY 
ERRORS 
BUT THE SECOND ONE DID NOT COST HIM 
IN THE WAY THAT THE FIRST ONE DID 
HE GOT AWAY WITH IT THOUGH WHEN 
HE MISSED THIS HE GOT THE DOUBLE 
KISSED ON THE WHITE THE RED COULD 
HAVE FINISHED ANYWHERE AT LEAST 
RONNIE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE 
SEEN STEPHEN MISS THAT READ 
BECAUSE IN THE OPENING FRAME HE 
WAS SUPERB THAT RED 
EVERYTHING FINISHED SAFE AS A 
RESULT OF THE DOUBLE KISSED 
THE MATCH IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES OLD AND 
O'SULLIVAN HAS NOT YET ATTEMPTED A 
POT HE COULD HAVE DOUBLE KISSED THE RED 
THAT MIGHT NOT BE TOO BAD I DON'T 
KNOW WHETHER HE CAN GET THROUGH TO 
THE RED THAT IS POSSIBLE POT HE 
COULD GO ROUND THE BACK OF THE 
BLACK CAN HE SEE ENOUGH OF IT TO 
TAKE ON THE POT HE COULD IN FACT 
HE OVERCUT IT THAT IS PRETTY SAFE 
I THINK 
YES JUST FRACTIONALLY OVERCUT 
O'SULLIVAN NOT POTTING SUCH AL HIGH 
PERCENTAGE OF THAT TYPE OF SHOT AS 
HE NORMALLY DOES 
HE IS LOOKING AT 
THE POT HERE STEPHEN BECAUSE HE 
HAD HAS NO SAFETY ESCAPE BACK UP 
THE TABLE HE CANNOT GET TO THE 
POTTING ANGLE SO HE IS COMING OFF 
THE CUSHION 
HE HAS GOT A LITTLE THIN SAFETY 
GET DOWN BEHIND THE GREEN THAT IS 
A POSSIBILITY FOR RONNIE 
EXCELLENT POT FROM THAT DISTANCE 
AND TIGHT ON THE RAIL HENDRY 
RECOGNISED THAT IT WAS A NATURAL TO 
GET BEHIND THE BACK OF THE BLACK 
BUT HE IS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED 
THAT THE CUE BALL DID NOT STOP A 
COUPLE OF INCHES EARLIER THAT 
WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM A CHOICE OF 
LOW VALUE COLOURS 
BUT ONCE AGAIN 
THIS TABLE LOOKS TO BE PLAYING 
BEAUTIFULLY THE CLOTH IS VERY 
RESPONSIVE 
LET'S SEE IF RONNIE CAN MAKE A 
BETTER ESCAPE THIS TIME L. THINK HE 
CAN SEE ENOUGH WELL HE IS CLOSE 
TO THE GREEN SO MAYBE HE HAS 
BLOCKED THE ONE CUSHION ESCAPE INTO 
THE PACK HE HAS THIS IS AN 
EXHIBITION TYPE SHOT HE HAS TO HIT 
FOUR CUSHIONS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
WE ALL KNOW WHAT O'SULLIVAN CAN DO 
IN POTTING AND BREAK BUILDING BUT 
HE HAS ALSO GOT A GREAT SAFETY GAME 
BOTH IN ATTACK AND DEFENCE JUST REACHES 
NOW STEPHEN IS WALKING AROUND THE 
TABLE HE MIGHT DECIDE TO HAVE A GO 
AT THIS RED INTO THE LEFT MIDDLE 
POCKET HE WAS LOOKING TO SEE IF HE 
WOULD LEAD AND THE PINK IT IS A 
BIT OF A FREE SHOT FOR HIM NOT QUITE 
THAT IS NOT THE BEST FROM RONNIE 
HE WAS HOPING TO MISS THE BLACK AND 
GET THE WHITE TIGHT ON THE CUSHION 
NOT SURE IF THIS RED WELL THERE 
IS ENOUGH ROOM PAST THE OTHER RED 
MAYBE O'SULLIVAN TRIED TO DO JUST A 
LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH WITH HIS SAFETY 
INSTEAD OF PLAYING IT 
CONSERVATIVELY AND WAITING 
HOWEVER COURTESY OF THE EXCELLENT 
INITIAL POT INTO THE MIDDLE POCKET 
HENDRY IS IN AGAIN HENDRY CONTINUING TO EXPLOIT THE 
CHANCE THAT O'SULLIVAN GAVE HIM 
ALBEIT A DIFFICULT ONE 
IT WAS A 
POOR SHOT CLIVE WASN'T IT YOU 
HAVE TO MISS THE BLACK THAT IS 
WHAT HE WAS TRYING HE JUST PUT IT 
STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK 
NO SPOT AVAILABLE FOR THE PINK SO 
IN CASE THERE IS STILL ANYBODY OUT 
THERE WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE RULE IT 
GOES AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE TO ITS OWN 
SPOT IN A DIRECT LINE BETWEEN IT 
AND THE BLACK SPOT AS NEAR AS 
POSSIBLE THE NEAREST BALL WITHOUT 
ACTUALLY TOUCHING IT 
OH THE WHITE WAS CLOSE WHEN YOU 
PLAY THAT TYPE OF SHOT IF YOU 
DON'T GET IT FULL BALL THERE IS 
ALWAYS THE CHANCE OF GOING IN OFF 
TO EITHER CORNER POCKET L. L. THOUGHT 
IT WAS GOING TO SPIN INTO THE 
POCKET AT LEAST RONNIE STILL HAS A 
BIT OF A CHANCE IN THIS SECOND 
FRAME HE IS YET TO POT BALL IN 
THIS SEMI FINAL TO POT A BALL 
AFTER TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PLAY 
MIND YOU IT HAS TO BE SAID HE HAS 
NOT HAD A SHOT TO GO AT A PROPER 
SHOT ANYWAY 
ANOTHER GOOD SAFETY FROM HENDRY 
BACK COVERING THE RED NEAREST THE 
BAULK LINE ANOTHER GOOD SAFETY 
FROM HENDRY THAT 
A GOOD REPLY FROM O'SULLIVAN HE 
WOULD BE RELIEVED STILL TO BE IN 
THIS FRAME 
THAT WAS COURTESY OF HENDRY NOT 
MANAGING TO OPEN THE BUNCH TO 
ADVANTAGE 
WELL RONNIE MAY BE FORCED THIS 
TIME INTO TAKING A LONG ONE ON 
STRAIGHT POT HE WOULD BE ON THE 
PINK OR BLACK HE REFUSED A LONG 
ONE IN THE OPENING FRAME AND ONCE 
AGAIN HE IS REFUSING THE LONG POT 
WELL THE LONG STRAIGHT POT WAS 
ALL OR NOTHING IF HE HAD KNOCKED 
IT IN HE WOULD HAVE GOT IN FOR A 
COUNTER ATTACK POSSIBLY A WINNING 
ONE BUT HAD HE MISSED IT HE WAS 
VIRTUALLY HANDING THE FRAME TO 
HENDRY WHO IS FORTY SEVEN IN FRONT 
BUT IT 
DOES TELL US HOW RONNIE IS BEING 
HERE HE IS GOING TO PLAY THE 
TACTICAL GAME UNTIL HE GETS AN 
EASIER CHANCE THAT IS WHAT HAWKEYE 
SHOWS YOU STEPHEN HENDRY IS LOOKING 
AT HE IS IN A BIT OF A WHOLE HERE 
IF HE DOESN'T HIDE THE CUE BALL HE 
WILL LEAVE THE ONE NEAR THE LEFT 
CORNER THAT IS WHY HE IS RELUCTANT 
TO PLAY BACK DOWN THE TABLE L. 
THINK THE MIDDLE POCKET IS IN THE 
WAY OF JUST LANDING ON THE RED TO 
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TABLE 
I THINK THAT SHOT HE WOULD NEED TO 
REALLY HIT THE MIDDLE POCKET IS 
RIGHT IN LINE WITH THAT ESCAPE 
WHICH IS WHY HE IS NOT ATTEMPTING 
THAT 
NOW CAN HE GET THROUGH TO THE RED 
PAST THE BLUE L. L. THINK HE CAN THIS 
IS THE FIRST CHANCE STEPHEN HENDRY 
HAS LEFT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN THAT IS HIS FIRST POT 
O'SULLIVAN ENGINEERED THIS OPENING 
THROUGH LEAVING HENDRY A SAFETY 
PROBLEM WHICH HE COULDN'T SOLVE 
AND I THINK WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN 
HOW IMPORTANT SAFETY IS GOING TO BE 
IN THIS MATCH COUPLED OF COURSE 
WITH HIGH BREAKS 
I DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER HE CAN HOLD TO PUT IT IN 
THE CIRCLE L. DON'T THINK HE CAN 
HE MAY HAVE TO PLAY FOR THE ONE 
NEAR THE CUSHION 
HE COULD JUST MANAGE IT HE COULD 
BE ON THE PINK HERE IF HE HAS GOT 
THE RIGHT ANGLE JUST TO NUDGE THE 
OTHER RED OUT OF THE WAY AND LEAVE 
THE PINK THEN THERE IS A GOOD 
POSSIBILITY HE COULD BRING THE 
BLACK BRING THE BLACK INTO PLAY 
IN A FEW SHOTS TIME A FEW SHOTS' 
TIME 
HE IS GOING FOR THE BLUE IT WAS 
NOT QUITE THE RIGHT ANGLE THAT IS 
PERFECTLY PLAYED 
THAT IS A POOR SHOT HE HAS 
UNDERHIT THAT A LITTLE SHAKE OF 
THE HEAD TELLS YOU HE WANTED TO BE 
STRAIGHTER ON IT AND THEN THE PINK 
WOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE 
IT IS AN AWKWARD BLUE NOW AND THE 
ONLY RED HE CAN PLAY ON IS THE ONE 
NEAR THE RIGHT CORNER POCKET HOW 
STRAIGHT IS HE ON THE BLUE UNLUCKY 
IF HE HAD KISSED THE BLACK HE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN O. K. CLIVE WOULDN'T 
HE 
YES BUT ALTHOUGH IT IS A HE REPLY FROM O'SULLIVAN IT IS NOT 
THE DECISIVE REPLY HE WAS HOPING 
FOR THE WHITE IS IN 
NO REAL DAMAGE THOUGH IT'S JUST 
COST HIM FOUR POINTS HE COULD SNICK THIS ONE IN 
NO HE IS KEEPING IT TIGHT IT IS A 
WHILE SINCE I HAVE SEEN STEPHEN 
HENDRY SO FOCUSED CLYDE HE REALLY 
DOES LOOK UP FOR THIS CLIVE YES YES HE HAS NEVER LOST FAITH IN HIS OWN 
ABILITY IN HIS LONG PERIOD IN THE 
DOLDRUMS THIRTY IT MONTHS WITHOUT A 
TITLE OF ANY SORT BUT THERE IS 
SOMETHING WITHIN ALL GREAT PLAYERS 
IN ALL SPORTS THIRTY EIGHT MONTHS AT THE 
CRUCIBLE THIS YEAR HE HAS MANAGED 
TO ACCESS IT 
THAT IS A VERY CLEVER 
SAFETY SHOT 
WELL IT WAS DIFFICULT TO AVOID 
CANNONING THE RED INTO THE BROWN 
AND HENDRY HASN'T MANAGED IT 
HE WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE UP THE TWO 
REDS NOW HE CAN CERTAINLY MOVE ONE 
OF THEM AND THERE IS A DISTINCT 
POSSIBILITY HE MIGHT EVEN FLICK 
THEM BOTH OUT IF HE CANNONS THAT 
ON THE LEFT SIDE AS WE LOOK AT IT 
HE COULD BRING THEM BOTH INTO PLAY 
BUT OF COURSE THERE IS A GAP IN 
THE MIDDLE THAT HE COULD QUITE 
EASILY SNEAK INTO IT HASN'T WORKED OUT 
IF IT HAD WORKED OUT KNOCKING BOTH 
REDS ON THEN A WINNING CLEARANCE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN ON BUT O'SULLIVAN 
HAS GOT TO DO IT THE HARD WAY NOW 
NOT A GOOD SHOT FROM RONNIE YOU 
HAVE GOT TO KEEP THE OBJECT BALL 
SAFE 
SOMEHOW HE HAS GOT TO GET OFF THE 
GET UP THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TABLE 
I AM NOT SURE IF HE HAS THE ANGLE 
TO SCREW OFF THE YELLOW HE MIGHT 
DO HE CAUGHT THE MIDDLE POCKET 
HENDRY LEADS BY TWENTY SIX IF HE HAD GOT 
POSITION ON THE LAST RED HE ONLY 
NEEDED THAT AND COLOUR TO SECURE 
EIGHTY TWO TO ZERO LEAD EIGHTY TWO TO ZERO LEAD OR TWO ZERO 
LEAD 
NOT A BIG ADVANTAGE THE WAY THE 
BALLS ARE SITUATED WHOEVER GETS 
THE RED YOU WOULD FEEL WILL BE 
FAVOURED 
HE HAS GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT 
CAREFUL IF HE SENT THE RED AROUND 
THE ANGLES SO EASY TO CANNON ONE 
OF THE BAULK COLOURS 
I THINK HE CAN STILL SEE ENOUGH OF 
THE RED TO TAKE THE POT ON 
IF THE 
CUE BALL HAD DROPPED IN IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN PRETTY WELL A FORMALITY 
FOR HENDRY TO POT THE RED FOR THE 
FRAME 
OUT OF THE JAWS OF THE BAULK POCKET 
NOT THAT EASY 
BETTER HITTING THAT 
JAW THAN THE OTHER JAW THE RED 
WOULD HAVE COME UP THE TABLE WITH 
THE WHITE 
NOT A GOOD SHOT AGAIN FROM RONNIE 
A BIT UNLUCKY I SUPPOSE TO HIT 
THE YELLOW BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO 
KEEP THE OBJECT BALL SAFE IN THIS 
SORT OF SITUATION COULD STEPHEN 
KNOCK THIS LONG RED IN WHICH WOULD 
PROBABLY SECURE THE SECOND FRAME 
SO THAT IS THE SECOND TIME HENDRY 
HAS ATTEMPTED VIRTUAL FRAME BALL 
NEITHER OF THEM EASY 
RONNIE HAS GOT VERY LITTLE TO DO 
WITH THE CUE BALL STEPHEN KNOWS 
IF THIS RED GOES IN RONNIE WILL 
LEAVE HIMSELF ON THE GREEN THAT 
WAS THE FIRST LONG POT HE ATTEMPTED 
PRETTY GOOD 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY THIS WOULD BE A 
GREAT FRAME FOR RONNIE TO TAKE 
O'SULLIVAN HAS BEEN ON THE BACK 
FOOT FOUR OF FRAME AND THREE 
QUARTERS FOR A FRAME AND THREE 
QUARTERS IF HE COMPLETES THE 
CLEARANCE HERE IT WILL BE ONE TO 
ONE 
HE IS JUST CUEING UP WHERE HE WOULD 
LIKE TO LEAVE THE WHITE SO HE CAN 
POT THE BROWN AND GET TO THE BLUE 
GONE A BIT TOO FAR BUT HE CAN 
ALWAYS SWITCH HANDS THE BLUE IS 
GOING TO BE A BIT OF A DISTRACTION 
FOR HIM I FEEL 
HE HAS GONE CLOSE TO THE BLUE THAT THAT WAS THE TROUBLE HE WAS THE WRONG 
ANGLE ON THE BROWN SO HE WAS ALWAYS 
GOING TO BE COMING INTO CLOSE TO 
THE BLUE COMING IN TO CLOSE 
THAT WAS A THIN SNICK IS HE GOING TO BE LUCKY 
THE BLUE WILL POT BUT STEPHEN 
HENDRY IS VERY CLOSE TO IT THEY 
ARE ALWAYS TRICKY WHEN YOU ARE 
THAT CLOSE TOGETHER 
NO THEY ARE SO TOUGH THOSE WHEN 
YOU ARE THAT CLOSE 
NOTICE HOW HE 
PLAYED IT WITH BACKSPIN TO BRING 
THE CUE BALL BACK ONTO THE CUSHION 
IN CASE HE MISSED IT 
NO ATTEMPT AT THE POT BECAUSE IT 
WAS STRAIGHT AND HE COULDN'T GET ON 
THE PINK 
HE DID SO WELL THERE TO 
AVOID THE DOUBLE KISS IT LOOKED AS 
IF THE WHITE WAS GOING TO CANNON 
INTO THE BLUE 
IT WAS FRAME BALL FOR TWO TO ZERO HENDRY 
KNEW THERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE THAT 
THE BLUE MITE GO NEAR OR IN 
MIGHT GOAT NEAR OR IN AND HE WAS 
ALWAYS RETURNING THE CUE BALL TO 
THE NEAR CUSHION IF IT DIDN'T 
SO BARRING A SNOOKER IT IS TWO TO ZERO TO 
HENDRY 
O'SULLIVAN DID HAVE A PRETTY 
REASONABLE CHANCE TO CLEAR UP 
BUT HE UNCHARACTERISTICALLY LOST 
POSITION ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HE 
ENDED UP MISSING A THIN CUT BLUE JUST A BIT TOO PACY 
IT IS SO AWKWARD TO GET THE SNOOKER 
WHEN THE BLACK IS NOT CLOSER TO THE 
CUSHION YOU HAVE TO BE SO PRECISE 
TO TRY AND GET IN BEHIND IT OH 
THE OLD DREADED DOUBLE KISS IT 
SPOILED IT 
RIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF THE POCKET 
STEPHEN HENDRY LEADS RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN BY TWO TO ZERO 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED PLAYING 
SNOOKER MY HERO WAS PROBABLY JIMMY 
WHITE L. SAW HIM IN AN EXHIBITION 
WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN HE WAS PLAYING SCREW 
SHOT AND EVERYTHING IT WAS GREAT 
TO WATCH WHEN WE STARTED TO BECOME 
SERIOUS I REALISED IF I WANTED TO 
BE A SUCCESS I HAD TO COPY STEVE 
DAVIS WHO WAS A WINNER MY 
GREATEST RANKED AS A PLAYER IS 
PROBABLY JUST BEING FEARLESS AT 
ANY TIME MY WEAKNESS WOULD 
PROBABLY BE THE SAME 
IT MEANS EVERYTHING FOR ME TO NOT 
ONLY WIN BUT 
TO WIN PRETTY L. WANT TO MAKE BIG BREAKS ALL THE TIME AND 
LOOK GOOD A LOT OF THE TIME YOU 
DON'T HAVE TO PLAY WELL TO WIN IT 
IS JUST IF YOUR ATTITUDE IS GOOD 
WINNING IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT THEY 
DO LIKE TO PLAY WELL I DO LIKE 
STEPHEN HENDRY STILL LIKES TO MAKE 
BIG BREAKS AND HE DID IN THE 
OPENING FRAME ONE HUNDRED FORTY BUT HE IS READY 
TO DRAW HIS HORNS IN AND PLAY SOME 
SAFETY MUCH READIER NOW THAN HE 
HAS BEEN FOR A FEW YEARS AND THAT 
ADDED ELEMENT OF STRATEGY IN HIS 
GAME I THINK HAS SERVED HIM WELL 
HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE 
O'SULLIVAN BREAKS OFFERED LEFT 
HANDED BECAUSE HE FEELS HE CAN GET 
MORE RIGHT HAND SIDE ON THE CUE 
BALL BREAKS OFF 
IT SEEMS STRANGE BUT IT IS UP TO 
HIM AND HE IS SO GOOD LEFT HANDED 
ANYWAY 
HE HAS JUST MADE A PRETTY GOOD 
BREAK OFF BLOCKED ALL THE AVENUES 
BACK DOWN THE TABLE AGAIN THAT IS 
WHY STEPHEN IS LOOKING AT COMING 
OFF A COUPLE OF CUSHIONS AND JUST 
LANDING INTO THE BACK OF THE BUNCH 
NOT QUITE HE HAS LEFT A CHANCE 
THAT WAS JUST A MISJUDGMENT FROM 
STEPHEN 
THAT IS THE FIRST MISTAKE STEPHEN HE HAS MADE EITHER IN DEFENSIVE OR 
POTENTIALLY CREATIVE SAFETY 
HE HAS TO MAKE SURE HE DOES NOT 
CANNON THE BROWN OR THE GREEN HERE 
HE MIGHT ELECT TO GO BETWEEN BROWN 
AND YELLOW BUT HE HAS TO GET PAST 
THE BLUE SPOT THE SIDE HE HAD ON 
THAT 
IN FACT HE GOT INTO IT TOO WELL A 
LOT OF RIGHT HAND SIDE STRIKING 
THE CUE BALL NEAR THE BOTTOM TO 
CREATE THAT SIDE SPIN DID NOT GET ON THE NEXT RED 
THIS WILL SHE YOU WHERE HE WAS 
STRIKING THIS TOGETHER SIDE SPIN 
WRITE DOWN THE BOTTOM WITH LOADS OF 
RIGHT HAND SIDE DOWN AT THE 
BOTTOM LOOK AT THE WAY IT SPUN OFF 
THE CUSHION BUT HE JUST OVERDID IT 
VERY NICELY PLAYED THAT HAD TO BE 
THIN THAT TO DO TO AVOID 
CANNONING THE RED ON THE RIGHT HAND 
SIDE CUSHION 
RONNIE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM 
AVOIDING THAT RED ON THE RIGHT HE 
HAS DONE IT AS WELL VERY GOOD 
TACTICAL STUFF THIS 
PROBABLY MOST FRAMES ARE GOING TO 
BE DECIDED BY BIG BREAKS BUT WE 
ARE SEEING SOME GREAT PRELIMINARY 
SAFETY 
ANOTHER GOOD SAFETY SHOT FROM 
STEPHEN HENDRY IS CAUSING RONNIE TO 
WANDER ROUND THE TABLE TO SEE IF HE 
CAN SPOT SOMETHING THAT POT IS NOT 
AN OPTION BECAUSE HE WOULD CANNON 
INTO ALL SORTS OF BALLS 
THE BLUE HAS SPOILED IT I AM NOT 
SURE IF HE HAS SLIGHT ANGLE ON 
THIS RED HE SHOULD BE O. K. HE IS 
COMING AROUND TO SEE IF THE BLACK 
IS AVAILABLE AND IT IS THIS IS A 
LITTLE TESTER FOR STEPHEN HENDRY IF 
HE TAKES THE ONE ABOVE THE PINK IT 
IS THE TYPE OF SHOT HE HAS BEEN 
MISSING 
WELL HE BOUNCED THE RED INN YES YES WHICH IS WHY HE HAS FINISHED BIT 
CLOSER TO THE CUSHION WITHOUT THAT 
KICK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN NICELY ON 
THE PINK OR BLACK 
IS THERE JUST ENOUGH ROOM ON THE 
BLACK SPOT PLENTY OF ROOM BY THE 
LOOKS OF IT 
THE PERFECT ANGLE TO KNOCK THAT RED 
AWAY FROM THE BLACK 
OH HE TOOK HIS EYE OFF THE POT IT 
IS AMAZING HOW MANY TIMES WHEN YOU 
PLAY A LITTLE CANNON LIKE THAT 
THAT YOU TAKE YOUR EYE OFF THE POT 
THAT IS THE FIRST SHOT THAT STEPHEN 
HAS MISSED SO FAR IN THE MATCH 
CLIVE 
YES AND IT WAS THE SORT OF CLIVE UNFORCED ERROR WHICH WAS UNDER RING 
HIM VERY FREQUENTLY WHEN HE WAS AT 
HIS LOWEST IN THE COMPARATIVE SLUMP 
THAT HE HAS HAD LASTING ALMOST 
THREE YEARS UNDOING HIM 
NOTHING DIFFICULT ABOUT IT HE HAS 
PLAYED THAT SORT OF CANNON A 
MILLION TIMES JUST HUMAN ERROR 
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN TO KNOCK A FEW IN HERE 
TO GET HIM UP AND RUNNING AND GET 
HIS CONFIDENCE HE LOOKS VERY COOL 
CALM AND COLLECTED AROUND THE TABLE 
BOTH PLAYERS DO THEY REALLY ARE UP 
FOR THE SEMI FINAL 
YOU CAN GET IN WITH A LONG POT YOU 
CAN FORCE AN ERROR THROUGH SAFETY 
OR YOUR OPPONENT CAN THIS WHEN HE 
IS IN CAN THIS THIS IS IN THE 
LATTER CATEGORY O'SULLIVAN IS IN 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE MATCH 
THE BUNCH IS NOT TOO BADLY SITUATED 
FOR THE SPLIT THERE IS BIT OF 
GAP IN THE REDS IF HE COULD GET 
INTO THAT GAP THAT IS THE GAP HE 
IS LOOKING AT HE DID NOT QUITE GET THE GAP 
NO THE JOINT AS TERRY GRIFFITHS 
IS INCLINED TO CALL IT JOINER 
HE STILL HAS A SHOT BUT NOT AS 
GOOD AS PERHAPS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
THE JOINER HE HAS MISSED HIS RECOVERY SHOT 
STEPHEN HENDRY IS LEFT WITH TWO 
LONG POTS ONE INTO EITHER CORNER 
POCKET ANOTHER TEST OF THE CUE 
ACTION THIS IS THE TYPE OF SHOT HE 
WAS KNOCKING IN THROUGHOUT THE EIGHTIES 
I SHOULD SAY MOST OF THEM IN THE 
NINETIES WHEN HE DOMINATED THE GAME 
IT IS AMAZING HOW HE COULD MISS THE 
BLACK OFF THE SPOT AND THEN KNOCK 
IN A LONG ONE LIKE THAT BUT THAT 
WILL MAKE HIM QUICKLY FORGET ABOUT 
THE EASY BLACK THAT HE MISSED 
WITH THE LONG HOT HE WAS BRINGING 
HIS FULL CONCENTRATION TO BEAR 
LONG POT WITH THE BLACK ON ITS 
SPOT HE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED 
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER STEPHEN 
HENDRY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BEST 
MIDDLE POCKET POTTER'S WE HAVE EVER 
HAD 
IF HENDRY GOES THREE TO ZERO HERE HE IS 
HEADING FOR AN OVERNIGHT LEAD 
HE HAS KEPT O'SULLIVAN VERY QUIET 
SO FAR O'SULLIVAN HAS BUNGLED HIS 
BEST CHANCE AND ALSO A HALF CHANCE 
HENDRY OUTSCORING HIS OPPONENT TWO HUNDRED FORTY SIX 
SEVENTY 
ALTHOUGH WE ALL KNOW WHAT A GREAT 
FRONT RUNNER O'SULLIVAN IS HE WILL 
HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE HOW GOOD HE IS 
IN DIFFERENT MODE 
STEPHEN WILL NEED ONE OF THE 
DIFFICULT REDS 
TWO OF THEM ARE NOT THAT WELL 
PLACED SUPPOSE THE ONE THAT IS 
NEARER THE CORNER POCKET IS NOT TOO 
BADLY PLACED 
HE WILL PROBABLY PLAY IT TO 
DROPPING BEHIND THIS ONE RATHER 
THAN TRY TO MOVE IT DROP IN 
HE LEFT A SLIGHT ANGLE TO GET ON TO 
THE BLACK FRAME THREE COULD BE HIS 
HE HAS MISSED ONE PART ONE BLACK 
OFF THE SPOT BUT EVERYTHING ELSE 
HAS BEEN PERFECTION IN THESE 
OPENING THREE FRAMES 
HENDRY WAS NOT REALLY PUNISH FOR 
HIS MISTAKE AT SHORT RANGE HE 
ALREADY HAS O'SULLIVAN UNDER SOME 
EARLY PRESSURE FORTY IN FRONT WITH THIRTY FIVE ON THE TABLE 
IT IS ENTIRELY UNDERSTANDABLE THAT 
O'SULLIVAN IS CARRYING ON BROWN 
AND BLUE ARE WELL SET FOR SNOOKERS 
FOR GETTING BEHIND IF HE GETS IN A 
POSITION TO DO SO 
FOR O'SULLIVAN IT IS TWO FOUR 
POINT SNOOKERS TO WIN 
THIS HAS GOT A CHANCE OF A SNOOKER 
IF IT KEEPS RUNNING IT WOULD BE 
ANY EASY ONE TO ESCAPE FROM AN 
EASY ONE IT STEPHEN CATCHES THIS 
RIGHT HE MIGHT EVEN GET THE 
SNOOKER BACK NOT QUITE RONNIE 
WILL NOT WANT TO POT THIS RED 
MUCH BETTER PLAYING FOR THE SNOOKER 
WHEN YOU HAVE THE RED ON THE TABLE 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE FORTY BEHIND 
AND YOU NEED TWO FOUR POINT 
SNOOKERS 
I THINK HE IS O. K. I DON'T THINK IT 
WILL GO IN OFF IF HE COMES OFF THE 
SIDE CUSHION AND HITS THE RED THE 
WHITE WOULD NOT GO IN OFF THE RED 
IT IS TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE POCKET 
CAN HE GET PAST THE PINK MAYBE NOT 
HE WILL HAVE TO BEND IT TO CREATE 
THE ANGLE AND IT AROUND THE PINK 
TO CREATE THE ANGLE AND IT 
AROUND THE PINK END IT 
AND HENDRY LOOKING AT THE TWO 
CUSHION ESCAPE 
THIS LOOKS GOOD THIS IS A TERRIFIC 
SHOT 
THEY HAVE TO BE SUCH GOOD SNOOKERS 
FOR THE TOP PLAYERS TO FAIL TO GET 
OUT OF THEM NICE SWERVE AROUND THE PINK 
IF STEPHEN DOES NOT KNOCK THIS RED 
IN THE PINK IS IN MUCH BETTER 
POSITION FOR SNOOKERS HE WILL BE 
POTTING EVERYTHING INTO THIS THIS 
WILL DEFINITELY CLINCHED THIS THIRD 
FRAME CLINCH 
THAT SOLID POT FROM HENDRY REMOVES 
ANY LINGERING DOUBT ABOUT THE 
OUTCOME OF THIS FRAME 
WHEN HE 
STARTS KNOCKING AT THE LONG ONES IN 
AND THAT IS WHAT HE HAS BEEN DOING 
HE IS GOING TO BE A HANDFUL FOR 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HE LOOKS IN 
TERRIFIC FORM AT THE MOMENT RONNIE 
WILL HAVE TO REALLY GO UP A FEW 
GEARS IF HE GETS A CHANCE HE WILL 
HAVE TO START WINNING FRAMES WITH 
ONE VISIT STEPHEN HENDRY IS 
BUZZING 
THREE TO ZERO IS NOT A MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB BUT 
IT IS FOOTHILL O'SULLIVAN COULD DO WITHOUT IT 
HENDRY HAS MADE ONLY ONE IT MISTAKE 
OF ANY SIGNIFICANCE IN THESE FIRST 
THREE FRAMES IT COST HIM VERY 
LITTLE 
WITH THE FOUNDATION OF A SIXTY BREAK 
EARLIER IN THAT FRAME STEPHEN 
HENDRY LEADS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN THREE TO ZERO 
VIRTUALLY FLAWLESS KNOW YOU GUYS 
ARE ALWAYS KEEN TO SPOT SOME OF THE 
MISTAKES WHAT A PERFORMANCE SO FAR 
WHAT DO YOU GAUGE ABOUT STEPHEN'S 
DEMEANOUR AND HIS FORM 
BEFORE THIS 
TOURNAMENT STARTED THERE WAS NOT 
ANY BUT THE AMONGST THE EXPERTS WHO 
THOUGHT STEPHEN HENDRY WOULD HAVE A 
SNIFF THIS YEAR PERHAPS APART FROM 
STEPHEN HENDRY HIMSELF L. SAID IN 
THE EARLY PART OF HIS MATCH AGAINST 
MARK ALLEN THAT I DID NOT THINK HE 
WAS BACK TO HIS BEST MARK ALLEN 
LET HIM OFF THE HOOK HENDRY SHOWED 
GREAT CHARACTER AND BOTTLE IN 
WINNING THAT HE WENT ON TO BEAT 
DING JUNHUI HE NOW LOOKS A TOTALLY 
DIFFERENT PLAYER AND HE LOOKS LIKE 
A POTENTIAL WINNER 
YOU ARE 
BEGINNING TO SEE THAT 
I THINK WE 
HAVE ALREADY SEEN THAT HE LOOKS TO 
BE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLAYER 
THAN HE WAS HALFWAY THROUGH THIS 
SEASON RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HAS HIS 
FIRST CRISIS POINT IN THIS WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP COMING UP 
CAN YOU SEE 
WITH STEPHEN HE IS ABLE TO TURN IT 
ON ON THE BIG OCCASION 
IT IS WHY 
HE IS A CHAMPION HE WALKS OUT 
THERE AND HE SAID HIMSELF CARPET 
SLIPPERS AND ALL THAT UNDER THE 
TABLE HE KNOWS THE ARENA BETTER 
THAN ANYBODY THAT IS WHY HE HAS 
BEEN THE CHAMPION SO MANY TIMES AND 
HE LOVES IT OUT THERE 
MY GOODNESS 
WHAT DRAMATIC EVENTS ALREADY AND WE 
ARE ONLY THREE FRAMES IN 
I THINK THERE IS ANOTHER FACTOR IN 
HOW WELL HENDRY IS PLAYING NOW HE 
WENT THROUGH THE FIRE AGAINST MARK 
ALLEN HE HAD TO LOOK DEFEAT 
SQUARELY IN THE FACE AND IT WAS 
VERY REASSURING TO HIM THAT HE 
MANAGED TO WIN THE LAST TWO FRAMES 
IN THE MANNER THAT HE DID MAKING A 
CLEARANCE AT THE END TO LEVEL AND 
THEN SEIZING THE LAST FRAME IN ONE 
SCORING VISIT 
THIS IS THE CRUCIBLE IT IS OUR 
ANSWER TO WIMBLEDON WEMBLEY AND 
OTHER GREAT THEATRES OF THEIR OWN 
PARTICULAR SPORTS TWICKENHAM THE 
MILLENNIUM STADIUM 
WHAT HAS HE LEFT THERE IS A LONG 
STRAIGHT RED TO THE RIGHT CORNER 
AND THE BLACK DOES GO RONNIE IS 
COMING AROUND TO HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
STEPHEN DECIDED TO HAVE A GO THERE 
HE COULD NOT SEE ANY EASY SAFETY 
SHOT HE TRIED THIS AS A SHOT TO 
NOTHING BUT MISS HIT IT 
THE MIDSESSION INTERVAL IS COMING 
UP RONNIE O'SULLIVAN COULD DO WITH 
A SIZABLE BREAK HERE 
THE HIGHEST BREAK IN THE FIRST 
THREE FRAMES A NEAR TWENTY THREE HE HAS 
ONLY HAD A COUPLE OF CHANCES 
ONLY TWENTY THREE 
THE YELLOW WILL GET HIM ONTO THE 
TWO RAIDS NEAR THE BLUE TWO REDS 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY THIS IS THE 
BEST CHANCE HE HAS HAD 
PURPOSELY LEAVING HIMSELF AN ANGLE 
TO POT THIS AND DISLODGE HER FEW 
MORE OF 
THE RAIDS FEW MORE OF THE RAIDS HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL THE REDS 
IT MUST JUST BE AN AWKWARD ANGLE TO 
HOLD FOR THE BLUE THAT IS THE 
REASON HE HAS RUN THROUGH FOR THE 
BLACK HE HAS GONE LITTLE BIT 
AWKWARD HE HAS THE PINK THERE AS 
WELL WHEN THE PINK GOES BACK ON 
ITS SPOT IT WILL BLOCK A COUPLE OF 
POSSIBLE POTS THERE ARE FEW OTHERS 
AVAILABLE A FEW OTHERS 
THAT IS SO CARELESS THAT IS FOCUS 
HE HAS LOST HIS FOCUS COMPLETELY THAT PINK WAS JUST AS EASY 
LAST FRAME 
O'SULLIVAN WAS NOT ABLE TO PUNISH 
HENDRY SIGNIFICANTLY LET'S SEE 
WHAT IT IS LIKE THE OTHER WAY ABOUT 
IT WAS PURE CONCENTRATION HE 
PLAYED TO RUN THROUGH ON THE BLACK 
AND DID NOT GO FAR ENOUGH HE WAS 
ON THE PINK BUT HE KNEW THE PINK 
WAS GOING BACK ON ITS SPOT YOU 
CANNOT AFFORD TO MISS THOSE 
GREAT SHOTS HAVE THEIR PLACE BUT 
SO DO UNFORCED ERRORS 
STEPHEN IS 
LOOKING AT ONE OF THE REDS IN THE 
TRIANGLE THERE THE OTHER ONE IS IN 
THE OPEN A COUPLE OF EASY ONES AVAILABLE 
IT LOOKS AS IF THE RIGHT RED OF THE 
THREE COULD BE AVAILABLE WITHOUT 
CANNONING INTO THEM HE WILL LOOK 
TO SEE IF IT WILL GO INTO THE LEFT 
MIDDLE POCKET 
THAT IS TIGHT BUT I THINK IT WILL 
GO INTO THE CORNER HE IS LOOKING 
TO SEE IF IT WILL GO INTO THE 
CORNER POCKET 
HE FEELS AS IF THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM 
IT DID LOOK VERY TIGHT DIDN'T IT 
WHEN HE POPS THIS IT WILL CLEAR 
THE OTHER TWO THIS IS A KEEN SHOT 
POPS 
HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT THOUGH IT 
DID NOT LOOK AS IF IT WOULD GO L. 
THOUGHT IT WOULD GO INTO THE CORNER 
HE MISSED IT ON THE FAR JAW THAT 
SUGGESTS THAT IT WOULD NOT GO INTO 
THE WHOLE POCKET 
BUT AT LEAST HE GOT SECOND PRIZE 
IT GOT SAFE NEXT TO THE BLACK 
RONNIE HAS GOT A STRAIGHT FORWARD 
SAFETY SHOT HERE JUST THAT BEEN 
WON CROSSED THE BACK CUSHION 
THAT BEEN ONE HE HAS TAKEN THE POT ON 
A FREE SHOT BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE 
FANCIED THE BLACK FROM THAT 
POSITION 
THAT IS A MISTAKE HE HAS BEEN 
LUCKY AGAIN HE HAS HELD HIS HAND 
UP HE MISHIT BACK AND HE'S VERY 
FORTUNATE THERE HE MUST HIT THAT TOO THIN A CONTACT 
O'SULLIVAN HAS GOT THE CUE BALL SO 
TIGHT TO THE CUSHION THAT HENDRY 
CANNOT RETURN IT TO A SIMILAR 
POSITION SO HE HAS GOT TO FIND 
SAFE LOCATION FOR THE CUE BALL OR 
PULL OUT A POT 
I THINK HE'S GOING TO HAVE A GO AT 
THIS INTO THE MIDDLE POCKET HE HAS 
GONE A BIT TOO FAR HE HAS LEFT THE 
ONE OF BETWEEN THE GREEN AND BROWN 
SO O'SULLIVAN'S SAFETY HAS CREATED 
THIS OPENING HENDRY WOULD NOT HAVE 
ATTEMPTED THE RED IF THEY HAD BEEN 
ANY FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVE IF 
THERE HAD BEEN ANY FEASIBLE 
ALTERNATIVE 
STILL FAR FROM EASY HERE THE WAY 
THE REDS ARE SITUATED AND THAT IS 
ANOTHER CARELESS SHOT THAT IS TWO 
VERY CARELESS SHOTS THAT RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HAS PLAYED CAN HE GET 
AWAY WITH IT AGAIN 
HE IS HAMPERED SLIGHTLY BY THE 
GREEN BUT THAT IS A BAD MISS 
O'SULLIVAN HAS MISSED A TWO POT IN 
THIS FRAME THAT HE NEVER MISSES 
TWO POTS 
MORE MISTAKES IN THIS FRAME THAN WE 
HAVE IN THEIR THREE PREVIOUS FRAMES 
AND THAT IS PERHAPS BECAUSE WE'RE 
GOING INTO THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL STEPHEN IS THINKING 
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT TO BE FOUR TO ZERO UP 
RONNIE WANTS TO BE JUST TWO FRAMES 
BEHIND 
EVEN THAT IS NOT GREAT ALTHOUGH 
HE'S ON HIS COLOUR WELL ENOUGH 
BUT WHENEVER O'SULLIVAN COMES TO 
THE TABLE HE TENDS TO THINK IN 
TERMS OF CLEARING UP IN ONE 
THAT LAST SHOT WASN'T THE BEST 
POSITIONAL SHOT HE HAS HAD TO 
LEAVE HIMSELF A LONGISH RED 
HE DIDN'T MAKE IT EASY FOR HIMSELF 
THE POSITION HE LEFT HIMSELF ON THE 
BLUE AND THIS IS A CHANCE FOR 
STEPHEN HENDRY BECAUSE HE CAN POT 
THIS LEAVE AN ANGLE ON THE BLACK 
TO BE ABLE TO BRING ONE OF THE 
DIFFICULT REDS INTO PLAY 
THAT IS JUST ABOUT PERFECT THAT IS A GOOD ANGLE JUST A LITTLE 
SOFT STUN SHOT THE DOUBLE KISS HER 
SPOILED IT HAS SPOILED IT 
HE'S LOOKING AROUND AT THE 
SCOREBOARD HE WAS THINKING ABOUT 
PICKING THE BACK DOUBLE ON HERE 
INTO THE POCKET THAT HE'S GOING TO 
LEAVE LEAN ON HE MIGHT EVEN TRY 
THAT 
NOT A LOT OF VALUE IN POTTING THE 
PINK HE MIGHT ROLL UP TIGHT BEHIND 
THE YELLOW HERE 
IF HE POTS THE PINK GET CLOSER TO 
RONNIE THEN HE WILL HAVE TO PLAY 
THE SAFETY SHOT ON THE RED HE'S 
GOING 
TO TAKE THE PINK THERE 
IS NO WAY HE CAN GET TO LEAVE THE 
RED ON FROM THIS POSITION 
WHAT DO 
YOU THINK WELL HE LEAVE HIMSELF IN 
A POSITION AND PLAY THE CROSS OVER 
SAFETY ON THE RED TAKING THE RED 
OF THE TWO SIDE CUSHIONS 
WE WILL 
FIND OUT SHORTLY WHEN WE SEE WHERE 
HE PLACES THE CUE BALL 
HE HAS NOT EVEN TAKEN THE POT ON 
THAT HAS BAFFLED ME WHY NOT ROLL 
IT TIGHT UP BEHIND THE YELLOW HE 
HAS PUT THE PINK SAFE WHICH IS TO 
RONNIE'S ADVANTAGE HENDRY IS STILL THIRTEEN BEHIND 
MAYBE HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT SHOT 
TOO MUCH 
I THINK YOU WILL ALL KNOW THE CUE 
BALL IN THIS FRAME NOW IT IS THAT 
PINK WHICH STEPHEN DID NOT MEAN TO 
PUT SAFE 
HENDRY WILL NEED THAT AWKWARDLY 
PLACED PINK TO WIN THE FRAME 
O'SULLIVAN WOULD NOT NEEDED NEED 
IT 
HE MIGHT EVEN BE TRYING TO KNOCK IT 
OUT HERE HE HAS TRIED A CHEEKY ONE 
IN BEHIND IT 
THAT LEFT O'SULLIVAN AWKWARD CUEING 
HE COULDN'T DO MUCH WITH THAT 
EXCEPT FOR KEEP IT SAFE 
THAT IS A MISTAKE THIS IS A BIT OF 
A CHANCE FOR RONNIE AND I DO NOT 
THINK HE WILL CANNON THE GREEN HE 
MIGHT SLIP PAST THE GREEN AND THAT 
WILL BE O. K. THAT WILL DO O. K. 
BROWN AND BLUE NEEDED AND I THINK 
RONNIE WOULD BE QUITE PLEASED IF HE 
GOES TO THE MID SESSION INTERVAL 
THREE TO ONE DOWN BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
HERE WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE 
HE HAS NOT SHOWN MUCH FOR ME IT 
BUT HE TOOK ADVANTAGE THIS TIME OF 
A RARE HENDRY SAFETY MISTAKE 
O'SULLIVAN TAKES THE LAST FRAME 
BEFORE THE INTERVAL 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN OFF AND RUNNING 
AT LAST I'M SURE THAT WILL BE SOME 
RELIEF TO HIM 
I WILL SAY STEPHEN 
GOT IN HE MISSED A RED YOU WOULD 
EXPECT THE GAME GOT SCRAPPY AFTER 
THAT STEPHEN MISSED A TRICK THERE 
HE POSSIBLY COULD HAVE HE POTTED 
THE LAST RED AND THEN HAD A CHANCE 
ON THE BLACK HE ROLLED BEHIND IT 
TAKE LOOK AT THE OVER HEAD THERE 
WAS A POSSIBILITY BEFORE THE SHOT 
OF HITTING THE PINK AND KNOCKING 
IT INTO PLAY OFF THE SIDE CUSHION 
PERHAPS LINING THE PINK AND YELLOW 
UP HE NEEDED TO GET THAT OUT INTO 
PLAY IT WAS MORE OF RISK BUT HE 
DIDN'T SNOOKER RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT 
THE SHOCK WAS TO GET THE PINK INTO 
PLAY WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE CHARGE 
OF A POT ON THE YELLOW 
THE PINK IS 
STILL IN PLAY YOU CANNOT POT THE 
YELLOW YOU CAN PLAY A SAFETY SHOT 
AROUND THE ANGLES BUT YOU HAVE IT 
BACK IN PLAY 
A LONG WAY TO GO IN 
THIS MATCH A QUICK CUP OF TEA 
BEFORE THE LAST FOUR OF FRAMES BUT 
STEPHEN HENDRY IS GOING FOR AN EIGHTH 
TITLE AT THE TENDER AGE OF THIRTY NINE 
WHAT ON EARTH DRIVES THIS MAN 
FORWARD PERHAPS ALLAH GRAPHOLOGIST 
CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON THIS 
HOWARD APOLOGIST HOUR GRAPHOLOGIST 
WHAT IS STRIKING IS THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE SIGNATURE AND THE TEXT 
THE SIGNATURE IS ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE 
AND IT IS STYLISED AND ELEGANT IT 
ALSO SHOWS VERY STRONG MOVEMENT 
TOWARDS THE LEFT WITH THE LOWER LIP 
IT IS GOING RIGHT THROUGH THE WHOLE 
OF THE MAIN NAME IT IS ALMOST 
AS THOUGH THIS PERSON IS SAYING 
THAT HIS BEGINNINGS HAVE MADE HIM 
WHAT HE IS HIS FAMILY ARE THE 
UNDERPINNING OF WHOM HE HE IS IT 
ENCAPSULATES HIM IT INCLUDES IT IN 
THAT LOOP WHICH IS THE FAMILY LOOP 
IT IS A FAMILY POWERFUL THING 
THE LATTER WHY AT THE END STICKS 
RIGHT UP IN THE AIR IT IS SORT 
OF BOLSHIE THIS IT IS WHO I AM 
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT IT IS 
A PLEASANT ENOUGH SIGNATURE IT 
SAYS THERE IS EMOTION THERE BUT 
THERE IS AN IMPLICIT DOMINANCE 
SHOWN I WILL DO IT MY WAY THAT 
IS WHAT COMES ACROSS WHEN WE LOOK 
AT THE ACTUAL WRITING THE PRINTING 
IT IS VERY MOBILE IT HAS GOT 
FIERY MOVEMENT ABOUT IT THIS IS 
MAN WHO DOES NOT CONFORM A MAN HE 
DOES HIS OWN THING WITH THE RIGHT 
SLOT OF THE WRITING HE CAN BE VERY 
RECEPTIVE AND FRIENDLY AND 
APPARENTLY INTERESTED TO SEE 
PEOPLE BUT LOOKING BEYOND THAT HE 
IS A LAW UNTO HIMSELF A BIT OF 
MAVERICK THAT IS PROBABLY WHAT 
MAKES HIM SUCH SUCCESSFUL PERSON 
HE HAS GOT THE INITIATIVE THE 
CREATIVITY HE HAS THE INDEPENDENCE 
AND INDIVIDUALITY TO BE WHO HE WAS 
MEANT TO BE 
SHE REALLY HAS BOOKED US OVER THE 
LAST SEASON YOU HAVE BECOME A BIT 
OF A LEGEND ON THE SNOOKER CIRCUIT 
EVERYONE IS TERRIFIED ABU HOW MUCH 
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE MEN BEFORE 
YOU BEGAN THIS ANALYSIS 
I DIDN'T 
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM THE FAINT 
OF SOME OF THEM WAS THERE I KNEW 
SOME OF THEM AS NAMES BUT NOT 
PERSONALLY 
HOW MUCH OF AN PERSONALLY INTRIGUING PROCESS IS IT FOR YOU 
KNOWING THE PUBLIC PERSONA BUT 
HAVING ACCESS TO THE PRIVATE ONE 
FASCINATING EVERY SINGLE ANALYSIS 
IS FASCINATING EVEN ONES THAT DO 
NOT LOOK PROMISING USUALLY YIELD 
SOMETHING INTERESTING 
WE THINK IT 
HAS BEEN SPOOKY ELAINE ANALYSED 
YOU 
I REFUSED TO EVEN LISTEN TO MY YOU ONE IT BORDERS ON THE WHEEL 
WEIRD AND WONDERFUL FOR ME L. WAS 
INTERESTED THAT STEPHEN HENDRY AND 
MYSELF ALL LIKE BLOCK CAPITALS 
WHAT 
THAT TELL YOU A USUALLY 
IT MEANS PEOPLE PLAY SAFE 
IT IS 
NOT SUPPOSED TO SHOW ANY CHARACTER 
BUT I THINK I GIVE YOU QUITE A 
POSITIVE ANALYSIS 
YOU GOT IT RIGHT 
WHEN YOU SAY PLAYING SAFE 
I DON'T 
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MYSELF 
THAT IS 
WHY YOU DO BLOCK CAPITALS HOW HOW TACTFUL D. YOU HAVE TO BE WHEN 
SOMEONE COMES TO AN PRESENTS YOU 
WITH A PIECE OF PAPER HOW MUCH DO 
YOU NOT TELL THEM THAT YOU CAN SEE 
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT IS HIS FOURTH IF I 
HAVE SOMEBODY COME IN FOR 
COUNSELLING I WILL TELL THEM 
EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO KNOW THERE 
IS NO POINT GIVING THEM A BLAND 
REPORT COUPLE MORE DO THEM ANY 
GOOD IF SOMEONE IS GOING INTO THE 
PUBLIC'S FEAR ALL I'M DOING SO 
BEFORE ENTERTAINMENT THERE IS NO 
POINT DOING PULLING SO WOULD THE 
PIECES WE ALL HAVE GOOD AND BAD 
YOU HAVE JUST GOT TO BE A BIT 
PACKED FULL 
SHEET IS GOODY TWO 
SHOES 
DON'T BE PUT IT IDEAS IN HER SHOES HEAD 
COULD YOU PULL SOMEONE TO HEAD PIECES JUST WANTS IT IS JOHN'S 
WHAT I COULD SAY ABOUT JOHN IS THAT 
HE PLANS OF THE ORGANISERS VERY 
WELL HE STARTS OFF WITH THE EYE 
WITH STRUCTURED SHAPE HE SETS 
HIMSELF TASK AND WORKS HARD TO 
GET IT ALL IN ORDER WHEN HE DOES 
ANYTHING THAT HE HAS TO STAND BY 
HE WOULD DO IT VERY CAREFULLY 
METHODICALLY HARD WORKING I'M I'M GETTING THE MONEY OUT NOW 
I AM NOT 
SURE WHAT YOU WERE LEANING ON WHEN 
YOU WROTE THIS 
THAT NOTEBOOK 
THE IMPORTANT THING IS IT IS A 
CLEAR UP PIECE OF WRITING NO 
EMOTION IN IT WE KNOW THERE IS 
EMOTION BECAUSE THE SIGNATURE HAS 
LOOKED IN IT AND THE PRESSURE IS 
QUITE STRONG WE DO HAVE A PERSON 
WHO GIVES A CALMER FRONT BUT TO 
ACTUALLY CARES 
DEEPLY INSIDE 
WHO 
ACTUALLY CARES DEEPLY YOU ARE 
AMBITIOUS AND YOU ALWAYS PUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
PER CENT INTO WHAT YOU DO THE 
OTHER THINK INTERESTING ABOUT THIS 
WRITING I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING 
HORRIBLE ABOUT YOU WHAT WE HAVE 
GOT IN THIS IS ABRUPT END STROKED 
HIS MEANS THIS AS SOON AS YOU HAVE 
DONE WHAT EVERY TEARS YOU SET OUT 
TO DO YOU'RE READY TO MOVE ON YOU 
WILL LEARN FROM THINGS AND SOME 
THINGS YOU WISH YOU HAD DONE 
DIFFERENTLY 
I REALLY AM FED UP DIFFERENTLY WITH THIS THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT 
TO HEAR L. WILL TAKE IT OFF YOU 
THERE IS ANOTHER ONE THIS THIS SIGNATURE IS VERY ELABORATE A 
LITTLE BIT OF DRAMA COMES IN L. 
THINK JOHN LIKE TO DO THE ODD BIT 
OF ATTENTION SEEKING IN THE 
PUBLIC'S FEAR PUBLIC SPHERE IT 
IS GOOD SHOWMANSHIP 
RIGHT ELAINE 
THE GOOD BITS HERE 
I'M GOING TO 
TELL THE WHOLE STORY 
NO DON'T 
NICE NEAT WRITING IT IS GOOD 
LAYOUT BEAUTIFUL LAYOUT MARGINS 
ON THIS SIDE YOUR BISSOLY HAVE 
GOOD JUDGMENT AND GOOD TIMING 
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE GOOD JUDGMENT 
THE WRITING IS READABLE IT FEEDS 
ON THE PAGE IN AND EITHER WAY BUT 
IT SHOWS YOU ARE VERY GOOD AT 
THINKING ON YOUR FEET EVEN UNDER 
PRESSURE YOU SHARPEN UP YOU HAVE 
SOME NEAT DOVETAILING WHERE IT 
DOESN'T TANGLE IT FITS IN ALMOST 
AS IF IT HAS BEEN BY DESIGN BUT IT 
HASN'T OF COURSE IT HAS BEEN 
DOVETAILED BY YOUR SKILL IF YOU'RE 
ARE RUN TELEVISION THINGS CHANGED 
END YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE 
WITH THEM QUICKLY BUT THE WRITING 
ITSELF IS QUITE ANALYTICAL SO YOU 
WILL HAVE THOUGHT THINGS THROUGH 
THOUGHT WHAT YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT 
HAVE WORKED OUT IN YOUR HEAD IN 
ADVANCE THIS IS QUITE A PROBING 
AND WRITING THE HANDWRITING OF 
SOMEBODY WHO THINKS HARD ABOUT WHAT 
THEY ARE DOING BUT IS ALSO WITH 
MASCULINE THINKING PATTERN IT 
MEANS THAT YOU THINK SHARPLY AND 
AGGRESSIVELY AT TIME YOU'RE NOT A 
MUMSY PERSON YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT 
MIND THINGS 
I SHOULD TELL PEOPLE 
THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME 
GENUINELY I HAVE MET ELENA YOU 
HAVE NEVER SEEN MY HANDWRITING 
BEFORE 
I'M JUST TELLING YOU WHAT I BEFORE HAVE SEEN HERE THE IMPORTANT THING 
THAT COMES THROUGH TO ME IS THAT 
YOU ATTACK KNOWLEDGE YOU WORK IT 
OUT YOU LOOK AT IT MAKE SENSE OF 
IT THE WRITING HAS GOT A GREAT 
SENSE OF DYNAMISM ENERGY THAT 
SHOWS SOMEBODY WHO KEEPS ABREAST 
KEEPS GOING WHEN YOU HAVE TO TALK 
BECAUSE THINGS ARE GOING WRONG 
SOMEHOW OR OTHER YOU KEEP GOING 
YOU HAVE GOT A NAIL THE LIE WAS OWN 
THAT IS THE ENERGY AREA SO YOU DO 
ENJOY WHAT YOU DO A LONG LOW 
WERE HIS OWN GOOD FIRM PRESSURE 
THE WHOLE ASPECT OF THIS WRITING IS 
OF ENERGETIC ATTACK IF YOU LIKE 
YOU CAN SEE WHAT I MEAN BY THE 
POWER IN THE WRITING IT IS NOT A 
MASCULINE SCRIPT JUST THE STYLE OF 
THE ANGLE OFTEN YOU WILL FIND 
LADIES WILL DO A LARGE WE LIVE 
IN THE PRESENT WE HAVE TO SURVIVE 
OFTEN WITH SEVERAL STRANDS AT ONCE 
YOU CAN DO THAT QUITE WELL I I SHOULD PROBABLY START TALKING A BIT 
LIKE THIS 
I HAVEN'T MENTIONED THE 
SIGNATURE THE FIRST PART OF YOUR 
NAME HAZEL IS READABLE WHO KNOWS 
WHAT YOUR SECOND NAME IS WE DO 
KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT YOU CANNOT 
READ WHAT IT IS IT IS A LITTLE 
THREAD SO YOU LIKE TO BE ON FIRST 
NAME TERMS FRIENDLY SO YOU WHAT A 
NATURAL WITH PEOPLE YOU JUST GET 
ON WITH THEM YOU ARE A NATURAL 
MARVELLOUS 
YOU HAVE GOT THIS IN A MARVELLOUS CHAIR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE 
WHICH SHOWS THAT YOU ARE COVERING 
ALL ANGLES YOU CAN MOVE EITHER WAY 
THE SIGNATURE IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE PAGE 
WELL A FANTASTIC THANK

ANALYSE THIS GOODNESS THAT HAS 
GOT US THINKING L. KNOW YOU'RE 
GOING TO STAY AROUND FOR THE NEXT 
WE WHILE BECAUSE YOU HAVE SAID ONE

BRILLIANT FOLLOWED BY TERRY 
GRIFFITHS STEVE DAVIS IS THIRD IT 
IS ALL GETTING VERY TRICKY IT IS 
ONLY DENNIS TAYLOR STILL TO GO 
FAVOURITE SNOOKER MEMORY OF JOHN 
VIRGO 
PROBABLY WHEN HE STARTED VIRGO DOING IMPERSONATIONS OF PLAYERS 
THE FIRST TIME HE DID THEM AT THE 
CRUCIBLE IT WAS FANTASTIC HE HAD 
EVERYBODY IN STITCHES DEFINITELY DEFINITELY SERIOUS STUFF NOW IT IS THE SECOND 
PART OF THIS OPENING SESSION IN 
THE FIRST SEMI FINAL OF THIS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY 
IT.COM WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP IT HAS 
BEEN ENTHRALLING SO FAR EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS THE EARLY 
ADVANTAGE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN TOOK 
HALF AN HOUR TO POT A BALL WE ARE 
RETURNING YOU TO DENNIS AND CLIVE 
STEPHEN HENDRY TOOK THE FIRST FRAME 
WITH A TOTAL CLEARANCE OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY AND 
HAS MADE FEW MISTAKES RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HAS MADE SEVERAL IF I 
WAS ASKED FOR REASON I WOULD SAY 
IT IS A SIMPLE ONE L. THINK HE HAS 
BEEN VERY TENSE FOR A REASON IT 
IS A VERY IMPORTANT MATCH THIS HE 
HASN'T GOT A WAY TO A GOOD START 
ALTHOUGH THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO 
I THINK HE GOT JUST A LITTLE BIT 
TENSE AND ANXIOUS 
WELL I SAID AT 
THE START OF THE MATCH THAT LONG 
POTTING WAS GOING TO PLAY A BIG 
PART IN THIS SEMI FINAL AND 
IMMEDIATELY STEPHEN HENDRY IS 
FACED WITH ONE 
NOW THAT HE HASN'T KNOCKED IT IN 
HE HAS LEFT 
RONNIE IN RONNIE CAN PLAY A LITTLE CANNON HERE PLAYED IT VERY WELL 
O'SULLIVAN'S HIGHEST BREAK IN THE 
FIRST FOUR FRAMES IN WHICH HE WAS 
STRUGGLING BO ALMOST ZERO HIS 
HIGHEST BREAK WAS ONLY THIRTY TWO 
THAT IS A TERRIFIC SHOT SO MUCH 
SIDE ON THAT TO AVOID CANNONING 
INTO THAT RED 
IT WAS SUCH A CLEVER SHOT AS WELL 
BECAUSE EVEN IF HE HAD CANNONED 
THE RED HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON 
ANOTHER ONE TO THE OPPOSITE CORNER 
EVEN IF HE HADN'T CANNONED HE 
WAS WALKING ROUND THE TABLE HE 
KNEW HE HAD GOT IT AS HE INTENDED ONCE AGAIN VIRTUALLY THE SAME SHOT 
THAT IS WHERE THE LEFT HAND IS SO 
USEFUL THAT TYPE OF SHOT IF YOU 
GET THE REST OUT YOU ARE SLIGHTLY 
HAMPERED HE JUST GET DOWN AND IT 
IS EFFORTLESS GETS DOWN 
WELL THIS IS ALL BLACKS AND REDS 
SO FAR 
IT IS NOT LIKE RONNIE TO BE LOOKING 
FOR A MAXIMUM BREAK IS IT CLIVE 
WELL HE HOLDS THE RECORD WITH 
NINE SUPERSEDING HENDRY AS THE 
RECORD HOLDER 
HE HAD EIGHT HE HAS ONCE AGAIN PLAYED IT WITH 
THE SIDE THERE MIGHT EVEN BE A 
POSSIBLE PLANT ON BUT THEY THINK 
HE IS ON THE RED ANYWAY IT IS NOT 
QUITE I THINK IT IS GOING TO 
THE LEFT JAW OF 
THE POCKET BUT IT COULD BE MADE 
I KNOW THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE WHO 
HAD A LITTLE BET ON THE POSSIBILITY 
OF THREE MAXIMUMS HERE THIS YEAR 
THEY GOT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO ONE AGAINST THAT 
HAPPENING 
WELL THAT WAS BEFORE HAPPENING THE FIRST ONE HAD BEEN MADE AFTER 
THE SECOND ONE HAD BEEN MADE THE 
ODDS CAME DOWN TO TWENTY TO ONE 
THE CANNON IS SPOILING IT HE IS 
NOT QUITE SAFE YET L. DON'T KNOW IF 
THERE IS POSSIBILITY OF 
ATTEMPTING THIS WITH LOTS OF SIDE 
TO POSSIBLY GET BACK ON THE BLACK 
BUT THE FRAME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING HERE FOR RONNIE HE MIGHT BE 
BETTER OFF JUST PLAYING FOR THE 
BLUE HERE HE WILL NEED HIS 
EXTENSION 
JUST A DELICATE LITTLE SCREW AND 
LEAVE YOURSELF ON THE BLUE 
NO AND THERE MIGHT BE A GAP 
BETWEEN THE YELLOW AND BROWN YES YES THERE MIGHT BE O'SULLIVAN PLAYED 
IT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO GIVE HIMSELF 
A CHANCE OF COVERING THE RED WITH 
THE YELLOW IF IT DIDN'T DROP 
NO IF HENDRY WAS GOING TO GET A 
CASE AT ALL GOING TO GET A KISS 
AT ALL HE DIDN'T WANT THAT ONE 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE TWO REDS HE 
COULD DROP THE GREEN INTO THE 
MIDDLE POCKET WE KNOW THAT THAT 
PLANT IS NOT FAR FROM BEING ALMOST 
STRAIGHT HE IS LOOKING AT THE 
ANGLE WITH THE GREEN IT IS 
DELICATE LITTLE SHOT TO HOLD FOR 
THE PLANT 
IT WAS THIN ENOUGH THAT HE COULDN'T 
REALLY HOLD FOR THE PLANT BUT HE 
HAS PLAYED THAT WELL HE HAS GOT 
ONE TO THE RIGHT MIDDLE POCKET 
A WINNING CLEARANCE AND A FOUR TO ONE LEAD 
IS NOW ON FOR HENDRY 
THIS WOULD BE A BIT OF A BODY BLOW 
AND A BIT OF A SHOCK FOR RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN IF HE WAS TO LOSE THIS 
FRAME HE WAS FLYING ALONG VERY NICELY 
THEY ARE ALL THERE NOW EVEN THE 
TWO REDS NEXT THE PINK ON 
DOESN'T WANT TO BE STRAIGHT ON THE 
BLUE HE CAN PLATE FOR THE RED TO 
THE LEFT OF THE TWO WHEN HE POTS 
IT IT CLEARS THE OTHER ONE FOR THE 
RIGHT CORNER HE CAN PLAY WHAT A 
FRAME THIS COULD TURN OUT TO BE FOR 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
BIG CLEARANCES TO SNATCH THE FRAME 
ON PINK OR BLACK ARE SUCH A BIG 
PART OF CHAMPIONSHIP SNOOKER 
THERE IS NO BETTER EXPONENT OF 
THOSE BIG CLEARANCES THAN HENDRY 
DOESN'T WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY 
STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK HE MAY HAVE 
TO LOOK AT THE PINK NOW WHICH IS 
WHAT HE IS DOING HE LOOKS TO BE 
STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK HE IS GOING 
TO HAVE TO COME BACK OFF THE 
CUSHION WITH REVERSE SIDE HE HAS COME OVER PAST THE BLUE 
JUST WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE ANOTHER 
SETBACK FOR O'SULLIVAN HENDRY 
MISSES THAT STRAIGHT YELLOW WITH A 
CLEARANCE IN THE OFFING AND WITH 
IT A FOUR TO ONE LEAD THE YELLOW HAS RUN 
SAFE THAT IS HIS ONLY CONSOLATION 
THAT COULD BE A TURNING POINT EVEN 
THOUGH IT IS THE BEST OF THIRTY THREE IT WAS 
A BIT OF A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM 
MISSING THAT 
HE MAY BE SNOOKERED BUT I THINK HE 
CAN SWERVE ROUND IT 
THE LITTLE 
SMILE FROM RONNIE HE MAY EVEN BE 
ABLE TO STRIKE THE CUSHION FIRST 
THAT WAS ACTUALLY A DOUBLE KISS TO 
POT THE YELLOW 
LOOK AT THE SHOT HE 
IS FACED WITH HE WILL GO OFF TWO 
CUSHIONS 
THAT WAS A TOUGH ONE THAT IS VERY 
LUCKY THAT IS VERY FORTUNATE THERE 
WELL TWO BITS OF GOOD RUNNING FOR 
HENDRY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF 
MINUTES MISSING THE YELLOW BUT 
GOING SAFE MISSING THE GREEN AND 
LEAVING O'SULLIVAN SNOOKERED FOUL AND A MISS 
THIS COULD BE A FREE BALL AS WELL 
IF STEPHEN CAN POT THE PINK AND 
HOLD FOR THE GREEN NO HE HASN'T 
GOT THE ANGLE TO DO THAT SO HE IS 
HAVING IT PUT BACK SO THAT SLICE 
OF GOOD FORTUNE FORTUNE MAY STILL 
GIVE STEPHEN HENDRY THIS FRAME 
HE WILL STILL PLAY IT THE TWO 
CUSHION ESCAPE WELL HE IS GOING 
ONE CUSHION THIS TIME 
WELL THE RANDOM RUNS OF THE BALL 
HAVE NOT GONE O'SULLIVAN'S WAY IN 
THIS FRAME 
SO IT IS STILL A CLEARANCE TO WIN 
FOR HENDRY 
O'SULLIVAN POTTED EIGHT REDS EIGHT 
BLACKS HENDRY REQUIRED FORTY ONE MISSED 
THE YELLOW BUT SOMEHOW GOT THE 
BETTER OF THE REMAINING EXCHANGES 
HE HAS FINALLY TAKEN THE FRAME ON 
THE BLACK TO EXTEND HIS LEAD TO FOUR TO ONE 
THERE WAS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT IN 
THAT AS YOU MENTIONED CLIVE 
RONNIE WAS GOING FOR ALL BLACKS 
THERE WAS SHOT HE WAS FACED WITH 
HERE HE IS ALMOST STRAIGHT ON THE 
BLACK HE HAS THE CHOICE OF SHOTS 
HE COULD PLAY IT BACK WITH REVERSE 
SIDE TO LEAVE THE WHITE WHERE I 
HAVE THE END OF THE LINE OR CROSS 
THE TABLE TO LEAVE THE CUE BALL 
WHERE I HAVE PUT THE OTHER WHITE 
AS HE PLAYED THE SHOT HE DIDN'T 
QUITE CATCH IT RIGHT HE WENT TOO 
CLOSE TO THE RED IF HE SLIPS BY 
THE RED HE IS O. K. IT FINISHED A 
LITTLE AWKWARD AND HE DIDN'T 
CONVERT THAT RED STEPHEN HAD A 
COUPLE OF SLICES OF GOOD FORTUNE TO 
FINISH UP TAKING THE FRAME WELL WELL HE CERTAINLY DID BUT WHEN YOU 
HAVE GOT SOME LUCK TAKE ADVANTAGE 
OF IT IT WILL NOT LAST FOR EVER 
ABSOLUTELY 
THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO THREE FOR 
SESSIONS AFTER THIS THREE FAULT 
SESSIONS 
BUT O'SULLIVAN DOESN'T WANT TO GET 
ANY FURTHER BEHIND WELL AN 
IMMEDIATE SAFETY MISTAKE THOUGH 
HE DID EXACTLY THE SAME IN THE 
OPENING FRAME THERE WAS 
DIFFICULT LONG POT ON HE DIDN'T 
WANT TO TAKE IT ON THE SAME 
APPLIED THERE HE COULD HAVE TAKEN 
THE ONE ON HE HAS CANNONED INTO IF 
YOU PLAY THE SAFETY SHOT YOU HAVE 
TO MAKE SURE YOU GET IT OR YOU ARE 
BETTER OFF HAVING GO AT THE LONG 
POT IMMEDIATELY STEPHEN HENDRY IS 
IN AROUND THE BLACK SPOT AREA 
WHERE HE LOVES TO BE 
O'SULLIVAN'S SAFETY SUCCESS RATE 
MEANS THAT THREE TIMES IN EVERY TEN 
HIS SAFETY HAS NOT BEEN GOOD ENOUGH 
TO PREVENT HENDRY FROM POTTING THE 
NEXT BALL 
EIGHT FRAMES TO BE PLAYED IN THIS 
FIRST SESSION AS YOU CAN SEE WITH 
THE SCORELINE THERE IS NO WAY 
STEPHEN HENDRY CAN BE BEHIND BUT 
HOW FAR IS HE GOING TO BE IN FRONT 
HENDRY DID SAY IN THE PRE MATCH 
BUILD UP HOW IMPORTANT HE FELT IT 
WAS TO GET AWAY WELL BECAUSE OF 
O'SULLIVAN'S QUALITY AS THE FRONT 
RUNNER 
IT IS O. K. THE ONE HE IS CLOSEST TO 
HE CAN TAKE THAT AND HOLD FOR THE 
BLUE YOU WOULD FEEL 
IF IT IS TOO THIN A CUT IN HE HAS 
THE BAULK COLOURS 
NO PROBLEM WITH THE RED UP THE 
OTHER END OF THE TABLE NEAR THE 
GREEN IT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER 
WHICH SIDE OF THE BLUE HE FINISHED 
ON 
JUST TAKE THE WHITE UP TOWARDS THE 
BROWN THAT WILL DO NICELY WELL I 
SEE IT WILL DO NICELY HE MAY BE 
SLIGHTLY HAMPERED NOW I SAY IT 
WILL DO NICELY 
AND MAY NOT HAVE LEFT THE FRONT THE 
ANGLE ON THE GREEN TO GET BACK FOR 
HIS NEXT RED A FRIENDLY ANGLE ON 
THE GREEN 
YES YOU COULD SAY THAT 
IS NOT A FRIENDLY ANGLE 
HE TOOK SOME SHOT ON THERE HAS HE 
SNOOKERED HIMSELF DEAR ME HE WAS 
TRYING TO LEAVE HIMSELF A LONG RED 
BUT WHAT A SHOT HE HAS PLAYED 
THERE HE HAS SNOOKERED HIMSELF ON 
ALL THE REDS 
I THINK HE THOUGHT 
DENNIS THAT HE MIGHT SCREWED TO 
THE BAULK CUSHION AND OUT AGAIN 
THE WAY HE WAS CUEING UP I THOUGHT 
HE MIGHT DO THAT BUT THEN HE JUST 
KNOCKED IT IN HE DIDN'T STUN IT 
OVER FOUR F. T. LONG ONE UP THE OTHER END 
OF THE TABLE OVER FOR THE LONG 
ONE 
FOUL AND A MISS 
RONNIE WILL HAVE THIS PUT BACK 
SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT AND YOU CAN SEE 
HOW CLOSE HE HAS TO GO TO THE BROWN 
MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE MY ALINE OUT 
AGAIN IF HE GOES THAT LINE HE 
WILL HIT THE BROWN TAKE MY ALINE 
OUT 
THAT SIDE CUSHION IT SEEMS TO 
SKID LITTLE BIT OFF THAT THAT 
TELLS YOU THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT 
TO ESCAPE FROM THIS 
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ESCAPE TO 
THE SAFE RED 
IT IS GIVING OFF AGAIN THE SHOT IS 
NOT ON SO YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE STEPHEN 
WITHOUT SOME SORT OF SIDE TO 
SQUARED UP THE SHOT IS NOT 
AVAILABLE TO STEPHEN TO SQUARE 
IT UP 
HE NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF SIDE TO 
JUST HELP THE SITUATION OTHERWISE 
THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN 
THAT WAS A BETTER CHANCE THAT WAS 
CLOSE BUT THE MISS WILL BE CALLED 
EVERY TIME BECAUSE THERE IS AN 
EASIER ESCAPE HE DID PLAY IT WITH 
SIGHT THAT TIME SO HE KNOWS THERE 
IS A POSSIBILITY HE CAN GET TO IT 
WITH SIDE ARE IF HE HITS IT TOO 
HARD AND HITS THE RED HE CAN PUSH 
IT ON 
HE IS NOT GOING TO GET TO IT WHAT 
IS THE RECORD L. KNOW MARK KING 
PLAYED ELEVEN OR SOMETHING AND JOHN 
HIGGINS DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE 
RECORD IS FOR MRS. 
I THINK IT IS TWELVE 
I THINK THE RECORD FROM A SELF 
INFLICTED SNOOKER MAYBE THIS 
MAYBE THIS 
HE GOT IT THAT TIME 
SO TWENTY A WAY 
A WAY FROM A SELF INFLICTED SNOOKER NO HE IS NOT TAKING THE POT ON 
HE HASN'T PLAYED THE BEST SAFETY 
SHOT IN THE WORLD THAT WAS 
CARELESS TO CATCH THE YELLOW THERE IT IS ON THE MIDDLE POCKET 
HE MUSTN'T HAVE FANCIED THE SAFETY 
BUT HE IS FULL OF CONFIDENCE AT THE 
MOMENT HE HAS STUCK RONNIE RIGHT 
IN HERE 
HE'S JUST LOOKING TO SEE WHAT IS 
AVAILABLE INTO THE LEFT CORNER 
POCKET THAT WOULD DECIDE WHETHER 
HE NEEDS TO GO INTO THE REDS OR NOT 
ALWAYS WAS GOING TO BE INTO THIS 
ONE TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITY NOW 
MADE A SIXTY FOUR BREAK IN THE LAST FRAME 
BUT DIDN'T WIN IT MAKE IT EVEN 
MORE IMPORTANT THAT HE WINS THIS 
ONE 
DIDN'T GET THE CANNON AS HE ONE INTENDED BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS 
GOING TO BE ANOTHER COUPLE OF REDS 
AVAILABLE TO HIM HE REALLY COULD 
DO WITH KILLING THE FRAME OFF AT 
THIS VISIT 
ALL BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED A SERIES OF 
LITTLE STUN AND SCREW SHOTS THE 
KEY TO BREAK BUILDING 
AND THIS IS JUST WHAT RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN NEEDED STEPHEN HENDRY 
TOOK ONE WILL POT ON AND THE WAY 
THESE PLAYERS ARE CUEING IT IS 
GOING TO BE ONE MISTAKE AND YOU 
COULD EASILY LOSE THE FRAME 
IN PEAK FORM THAT WOULD BE THE 
CASE 
O'SULLIVAN HAS TAKEN THESE WITH 
GREAT ASSURANCE 
THE YELLOW WAS SLIGHTLY PROTECTED 
BY THE BROWN 
BUT THAT WAS BRILLIANTLY DONE YOU YOU WILL NOT SEE A BETTER POSITIONAL 
SHOT THAN THAT LAST ONE ON THE 
YELLOW 
WARMING UP VERY NICELY THIS SEMI 
FINAL IT IS GREAT TO SEE BOTH 
PLAYERS CUEING WELL 
O'SULLIVAN STARTED QUITE 
UNCERTAINLY 
HENDRY TOOK THE OPENING FRAME WITH 
A CLEARANCE OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
BUT O'SULLIVAN AT REDUCES HENDRY'S 
LEAD TO FOUR TO TWO 
IT IS THE FIRST TIME IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP THAT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
HAS HAD A SIZEABLE DEFICIT TO MAKE 
UP HOW DO YOU READ THIS FROM HIS 
PERSPECTIVE 
I THINK THE SESSION SO PERSPECTIVE FAR HAS BEEN A FASCINATING IT HAS 
HAD GREAT PLAY BUT FANTASTIC 
TENSION AS WELL RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
WAS THE FIRST PLAYER TO MAKE A 
MISTAKE IN THE SECOND FRAME WHEN 
HE FAILED TO CLEAR UP THE COLOURS 
AND LOST POSITION AND IN THE FIFTH 
FRAME THE ONE STEPHEN HENDRY WON 
TO GO FOUR TO ONE UP THAT WAS FULL OF 
TENSION BECAUSE STEPHEN REALISED 
HE HAD A RONNIE O'SULLIVAN ON THE 
ROPES HE JUST ABOUT GOT OVER THE 
LINE BUT THAT IS FANTASTIC PLAY BY 
RONNIE TO GET BACK INTO IT WHEN HE 
HAS BEEN ASKED QUESTIONS SO FAR IN 
THIS TOURNAMENT HE HAS RESPONDED 
WELL THIS IS GOING TO BE THE 
BIGGEST ASK SO FAR 
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK SO FAR 
I WAS GOING TO USE 
THAT WORD FASCINATING YOU JUST 
THINK STEPHEN IS ON TOP BUT YOU 
THINK ONE MISTAKE AND RONNIE IS 
GOING TO BE JUMPING AT HIM IT IS 
INTRIGUING WHICH OF THESE TWO 
THEY HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR REACH 
OTHER AND IS SUCH A FINE LINE 
BETWEEN MISSING ONE BALL 
A PASS TO 
BE CAGEY BECAUSE ONE SLIP AND THE 
OTHER KNOWS THAT THE OTHER IS 
COMPLETELY CAPABLE OF CLEARING UP 
IN ONE VISIT 
IF YOU HAVE TO SAY IF 
IT WENT TO THE FINAL SESSION HOW 
WOULD IT BE BEST BALANCED PROVED TO 
BE THE MOST ENTERTAINING FINAL 
SESSION YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY 
STEPHEN HENDRY A COUPLE OF FRAMES 
IN FRONT IF RONNIE IS IN FRONT HE 
IS THE BEST FLYING MACHINE IN THE 
GAME IF STEPHEN IS IN FRONT IT 
SETS IT UP VERY NICELY AS LONG AS 
READY IS PLAYING CATCH UP YOU 
NEVER KNOW WHERE YOU STAND 
RONNIE IS PLAYING CATCH UP 
THE LAST FRAME WERE 
CALLED FOR RONNIE O'SULLIVAN'S FIVE 
MINUTES MAXIMUM TEN YEARS AGO 
RECALLED 
HE WENT FULL BODIED FOR THAT RED I 
KEEP SAYING IT WILL BE A KEY PART 
OF THIS SEMI FINAL THESE TYPE OF 
SHOT WHOEVER KNOCKS MORE OF THOSE 
IN I WOULD SAY WILL BE THE 
EVENTUAL WINNER 
THERE WAS A LOT OF 
PRESSURE ON THAT ONE 
HENDRY KNEW HE WAS LEAVING 
O'SULLIVAN RIGHT IN IF HE MISSED IT 
HOWEVER IF HE POTTED IT HE WOULD 
BE RIGHT IN 
A COUPLE OF REDS AVAILABLE BUT WE 
KNOW THAT RONNIE LIKES TO GO INTO 
THEM AS SOON AS HE CAN HE'S GOING 
TO LEAVE THAN THIS TIME STILL TWO 
REDS AVAILABLE NOT A GOOD BUNCH TO 
GOING TO THERE HAVING SAID THAT 
THEY ARE NOT QUITE A AS WILLIE 
THORNE FLAT PACK 
THE WEAKEST PART OF THE BUNCH IS 
THE MIDDLE IF O'SULLIVAN CAN GET 
THE CUE BALL INTO THE MIDDLE AT 
SOME SPEED HE WOULD BE ON RED OR 
REDS 
A BIT STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK SO HE 
CANNOT GO INTO THE REDS 
HE DIDN'T PLAY FOR THIS HE PLAYED 
FOR THE ONE TO THE MIDDLE POCKET 
WHAT A BONUS THIS COULD TURN OUT TO 
BE 
THAT WAS BAD CUEING FROM RONNIE HE 
IS JUST HAVING TO RAISE THE BUTT OF 
THE CUE SLIGHTLY BUT THAT IS 
STRAIGHTFORWARD POT 
THAT IS THE 
THIRD EASY BALL O'SULLIVAN HAS 
MISSED THIS AFTERNOON 
I THOUGHT HE COULD CUT THAT BACK 
BUT HE CANNOT SEE ENOUGH OF IT 
WHICH IS WHY HE PLAYED THE SAFETY 
SHE SO REALLY DID GETS AWAY WITH 
THAT RONNIE REALLY DID GET AWAY 
WITH THAT 
AS IT HAPPENS HENDRY 
HAS GOT AWAY WITH HIS TWO WORST 
ERRORS 
OVER FOUR SESSIONS THE LUCK TENDS 
TO BALANCE ITSELF OUT 
IT IS A FASCINATING TUSSLE I'M 
ENJOYING EVERY BALL 
TENSE AND DRAMATIC EVEN THOUGH IT 
IS ONLY THE FIRST SESSION OF FOUR 
WE ARE WATCHING THE TWO GREATEST 
BREAK BUILDERS THE GAME HAS EVER 
SEEN 
THERE IS A POT HE COULD HAVE A GO 
AT BUT HE'S LOOKING FOR THE SAFETY 
SHOT IF IT IS AN AWKWARD SAFETY 
SHOT SOMETIMES MAYBE IT IS BETTER 
HAVING GO AT THE POT HE DOES POT 
SO WELL BUT HE'S WANTING TO PLAY 
THE PERCENTAGE GAME HERE 
AND IN MOST SESSIONS OF THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP O'SULLIVAN'S LAW 
POTTING HAS NOT BEEN AS GOOD AS THE 
REST OF HIS GAME LONG POTTING 
NOW THIS LOOKS VERY GOOD HE MAY 
HAVE BROUGHT ALL THE PATHS BACK 
DOWN THE TABLE BLOG STEPHEN 
KNOWS THAT IT WAS A GOOD LENGTH 
WHEN HE GOT ON HIS SAFETY SHOT 
THERE AND HE MAY BE IN QUITE A BIT 
OF TROUBLE HERE CAN HE SEE A RED 
TO SNICK OFF 
HE FOUND THE GAP AND HE FOUND THE 
POT 
THAT HAS DRIFTED THAT DEFINITELY 
HAS DRIFTED OFF A LITTLE BIT 
INTENDED TO BE RIGHT UP TIGHT 
BEHIND THE YELLOW BUT IT 
DEFINITELY DEVIATED FROM A STRAIGHT 
LINE 
AND LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT IT CAN 
MAKE WHEREAS THE CUE BALL GOING 
HOUR CLOSER PICTURE DID SHOW THAT 
IT TURNED TO THE RIGHT AS WE LOOK 
IS ITS HOUR CLOSE UP PICTURE 
IT TURNED AWAY IN THE LAST FOUR OR 
FIVE INCHES THAT IS FOR SURE 
TRYING A DELICATE LITTLE NESTLE ON 
TO THE TWO REDS THERE THAT IS STILL PRETTY GOOD 
IF THE BROWN POTS RONNIE WILL TAKE 
THIS RED ON THAT IS NEXT NEXT TO 
THE PINK HE CAN RUN UP PAST THE 
YELLOW THE BROWN IS THERE THAT IS 
WHY IT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR STEPHEN 
TO TRY AND GET IN BEHIND THE TWO 
REDS IF THIS GOES IN I THINK IT 
IS THE KEY TO HIM TAKING THE FRAME 
THE WHITE IS CLOSE HE MAY NOT BE 
ABLE TO HIT THE BROWN NOW IS THE 
KNUCKLE OF THE POCKET STOPPING HIM 
FROM GETTING THE BROWN HE CAN 
STILL JUST ABOUT GET IT FUNNY LITTLE SHOTS THESE THOUGH 
IT HAS TURNED OUT ABSOLUTELY FINE 
THOUGH 
HE GOT A GENEROUS ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
THERE BUT IT WAS A DECENT ONE OF 
THE BALL IT LOOKED AS IF HE WAS 
PLAYING CANNON TO KNOCK IT OVER 
THE POCKET BUT HE DIDN'T HE HAD 
TO HOPE HE DROPPED ON RED 
COULDN'T HAVE WORKED OUT BETTER FOR 
HIM 
YOU'RE NEVER SURE EXACTLY WHERE THE 
WHITE IS GOING TO GO HE HIT THE 
CORRECT SIDE OF THE RED IT 
COULDN'T HAVE FINISHED BETTER 
SO O'SULLIVAN HAVING BEEN FOUR TO ONE DOWN 
WITH WITHIN EASY REACH 
THAT LONG RED WOULD HAVE SETTLED 
FOR FLIGHT FRAME CONCLUSIVELY 
BUT IT IS WORTH PLAYING ON 
IT IS ONE FOR SNOOKER TO TIE FOR 
HENDRY FOUR SNOOKER SO IT IS TWO SNOOKER'S TO TIE NOW 
I BELIEVE HENDRY WOULD HAVE GIVEN 
THIS FRAME UP NEEDING TWO 
SNOOKER'S TO TIE BUT THIS IS A 
VITAL FRAME HE WON A VITAL FRAME 
IN THE FIRST ROUND AGAINST MARK 
ALLEN NEEDED TWO SNOOKERS L. COULD 
NEVER REMEMBER THAT HAPPENING IN 
HIS CAREER TOO MANY SNOOKERS 
NEEDED NOW THOUGH 
BUT HE HAS KEPT HIS FOCUS HERE THIS 
AFTERNOON RONNIE O'SULLIVAN MR. 
FEW CITIES BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY 
AFFECT HIM MISSED A FEW CITIES HE HAS LOOKED FULLY FOCUSED 
O'SULLIVAN HAS WON THE LAST TWO 
BRINGS FRAMES 
VERY DANGEROUS WHEN HE IS IN THE 
BALLS YOU MADE A GOOD POINT WHAT 
DID YOU LIKEN THIS CONTEST TO IT IT IS LIKE STEPHEN TRYING TO HOLD THE 
TIGER BY THE TAIL RONNIE IS 
ITCHING TO GET AMONGST THE BALLS 
WHEN HE DOES HE IS SCORING HEAVILY 
YOU FEEL AS IF IF STEPHEN LET HIM 
OFF THE LEASH HE IS GOING TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE 
THAT HAS BEEN THE ADVANTAGE PATTERN IN STEPHEN'S LAST COUPLE OF 
MATCHES HE HAS HAD TO ESTABLISH A 
BIG LEAD 
YES THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING FOR STEPHEN HENDRY'S 
PERSPECTIVE IT LOOKS AS IF HE IS 
GETTING OFF TO GOOD STARTS IT IS 
VITAL AGAINST RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
BUT I THINK STEPHEN HENDRY SHOULD 
HE LOSE THE LAST FRAME OF THE 
SESSION WOULD ACTUALLY BE VERY 
DISAPPOINTED WITH HOW HE HAS 
FINISHED OF THE SESSION RONNIE 
WOULD FEEL AS IF HE HAS BEEN GIFTED 
TO SOME DEGREE A CHANCE TO GET 
BACK ON LEVEL TERMS 
EXPLAIN WHAT 
IT MEANS TO BE SITTING IN THE SEMI 
FINALS RIGHT NOW STEPHEN HENDRY 
TALKED ABOUT IT AS ONLY BEING 
HALFWAY IT IS A VERY LONG 
TOURNAMENT THIS TO THINK ABOUT IT 
IN THOSE TERMS THAT YOU ARE ONLY 
HALFWAY DO YOU HAVE TO ADOPT A NEW 
MINDSET 
I THINK IT IS BUSINESS AS MINDSET USUAL YOU ARE PLAYING EVERY DAY 
BUT YOU'RE HALFWAY THERE WITH THE 
NUMBER OF SESSIONS BUT ALONG WAY 
INTO THE TOURNAMENT 
WHEN YOU THINK 
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF FRAMES AND YOU 
COULD STILL PLAY IT IS A LOT SIXTY NINE 
POSSIBLY THEY HAVE PLAYED POSSIBLY 
SIXTY EIGHT TODAY 
BUT YOU ARE THINKING 
ABOUT THE MAGIC NUMBER IN THIS 
CASE SEVENTY ONE FRAME AT A TIME KEEP 
LOOKING AT THE SCOREBOARD LET'S LET'S SEE WHETHER STEPHEN CAN HOLD THIS 
TIGER BY THE TAIL LAST FRONT OF 
THE SESSION FRAME 
THIS DECIDES WHETHER 
STEPHEN HENDRY LEADS OVERNIGHT OR 
WHETHER HE IS PAID BACK 
RONNIE GOT A GOOD CUE BALL THOUGH 
TOOK AN ELEMENT OF THE RISK OUT OF 
IT 
HE WAS VERY UNLUCKY IN THE LAST 
FRAME STEPHEN HENDRY 
LOOK AT THE TIP OF THE CUE THAT 
WAS COSTLY 
DIDN'T LOSE IT FROM THAT BUT IT 
GOT HIM ON THE BACKFIRED BACK 
FOOT AND HE NEVER GOT IN CONTROL 
OF THE FRAME 
GOT TO BE A WEE BIT CAREFUL HERE 
HE COULD LAND ON RED AND LEAVE 
ANOTHER ONE ON HERE HE PLAYED IT 
PRETTY WELL OR DID HE 
CAN HE GET TO THE POTTING ANGLE OF 
THIS ONE YES HE CAN 
GOT PLENTY OF ACTION IN FACT IT 
TOO MUCH OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE 
HAD A STRAIGHTFORWARD PINK 
THAT IS TERRIFIC CUEING THERE NOW 
HE CAN GET HIMSELF UP ONTO THE 
BLACK 
IN THE EARLY FRAMES O'SULLIVAN 
SEEMED TO BE PLAYING AGAINST THE 
GRAIN BUT HE CAME TO LIFE WITH A 
BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED TWO IN THE SIXTH FRAME 
HE WAS ALWAYS IN CONTROL OF THE 
LAST FRAME AND HE CERTAINLY 
LOOSENED UP HE WAS PRETTY TENSE I 
BELIEVE IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF 
FRAMES 
I WAS JUST THINKING IT WOULD BE A 
BONUS IF HE WAS ON THE PINK BUT IT 
IS A BIT TIGHT 
HE MISSED AN EASY PINK FROM THAT 
EARLIER EASIER PINK THAN THAT 
HAVE TO GO UP FOR ONE OF THE BAULK 
COLOURS HERE 
THEY'RE ALL COVERING EACH OTHER 
SOMEWHAT 
JUST HAVING A LOOK TO SEE WHAT IS 
AVAILABLE JUST THIS ONE RED AND 
DO REST SEEM TO BE BLOCKING EACH 
OTHER THE ONE TO THE RIGHT OF THE 
BLUE IS THE WHEN HE CAN TAKE THE 
ONE HE CAN TAKE 
HE HAS GOT AN ANGLE ON THE PINK NOW 
SO HE CAN DEVELOP THE REDS 
JUST A DELICATE ONE BUT THAT WAS 
ALL HE NEEDED 
ANOTHER IMPORTANT CAMEMBERT HE 
PLAYED IT WELL OR ANOTHER 
IMPORTANT CANNON THERE 
NOW THAT HIS CONCENTRATION THAT IS 
NOT PRESSURE HE HIT THAT REALLY 
HARD HE HAD TO FORCE AN ANGLE 
THAT WAS A LAPSE IN CONCENTRATION 
HE WAS HAMPERED SLIGHTLY BUT WHAT 
A MISS 
IT WASN'T THE SORT OF SHOT WHICH 
O'SULLIVAN OR WOULD NORMALLY MISS 
HAMPERED OR NOT 
HE HAS ONLY REALLY GOT ONE 
DIFFICULT RED THE WON THE LEFT 
SIDE OF THE TABLE THESE TWO WITH 
THE RIGHT SIDE ARE NOT THAT BAD 
THE BLACK IS AT THE OTHER END OF 
THE TABLE SO HAVING TO CONCENTRATE 
ON THE PINK 
THE PINK BACK ON ITS SPOT WOULD 
HELP THINGS HERE HE HAS PLAYED IT 
WELL 
A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO HENDRY 
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT FALTER FOR 
COMING UP HERE BUT HE FINDS 
HIMSELF AFTER THE FAILURE OF THAT 
BLACK IN WITH A CHANCE OF TAKING A 
FIVE TO THREE OVERNIGHT LEAD 
IT FOUR TO FOUR IT IS IMPERATIVE HE GETS A GOOD 
ANGLE ON THE PINK THE TWO REDS ON 
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE 
ARE NOT THAT DIFFICULT PROVIDED HE 
GETS A GOOD ANGLE HERE 
JUST DEPENDING ON WHERE HE HAS 
FINISHED IF HE CAN GET ANYWHERE 
NEAR THAT WHITE IN BETWEEN THE TWO 
REDS HE WILL BE O. K. 
HE DOES NOT WANT TO CATCH THIS ONE 
HE HAS PLAYED IT PERFECTLY 
WHAT SORT OF ANGLE DOES HE HAVE ON 
THE PINK IF IT IS STRAIGHT HE 
CANNOT DO MUCH WITH IT THINK HE 
IS STRAIGHT ON THIS IT IS A VERY 
DIFFICULT THING TO DO ANYTHING WITH 
IT THERE IS ONLY A SLIGHT ANGLE 
HE CANNOT GET CLOSE TO THE REDS 
I THINK HE WILL REFUSE THIS ONE HE 
WAS TRYING TO LEAVE THIS ONE UP THE 
CUSHION THE WHITE HAS COME AWAY 
FROM THE POCKET THIS IS TOUGH 
SHOT HE IS LOOKING AT WELL IS 
HE GOING TO TAKE THIS UP THE 
CUSHION 
I WOULD NOT FANCY THAT STEPHEN IS 
POTTING THE REST AWAY HE DOES NOT 
FANCY IT NOW POTTING THE REST 
AWAY POTTING GOOD SAFETY 
ALSO A GOOD SAFETY 
HE IS SNOOKERED 
ON THIS RED BUT HE CAN BEND ITS 
NIGHTLY HE DOES NOT WANT TO MOVE 
THE OTHER ONE OFF THE CUSHION A 
LITTLE BIT OF SWERVE 
RONNIE IS DEBATING WHETHER TO MOVE 
THE ONE OFF THE CUSHION HE CAN GET 
DOWN BEHIND THE BLACK OR GREEN HOW 
IS HIS STRENGTH ON THIS IT LOOKS 
PRETTY GOOD VERY GOOD SHOT FROM 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN O. K. IT IS NOT A 
FULL BALL SNOOKER BUT HE HAS 
STEPHEN IN ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE 
HERE 
IS IT GOING TO BE FOUR EACH OR IS 
IT GOING TO BE FIVE TO THREE TO STEPHEN 
HENDRY WE WILL FIND OUT IN ABOUT 
FIVE OR SIX MINUTES TIME 
DOES NOT WANT THE DOUBLE KISS AND 
DID NOT GET IT 
HE IS O. K. HE WAS CONCENTRATING VERY HARD ON 
COVERING THE RED BETWEEN THE BAULK 
LINE AND THE BLUE 
HE CAN GET THROUGH TO THE ONE NEAR 
THE POCKET 
NO THAT WAS TOUGH WHERE WILL THE 
RED FINISH WILL HE BE LUCKY HE 
WILL SETTLE FOR THAT 
WHEN YOU TAKE THAT TYPE OF SHOT ON 
CLIVE YOU DON'T EXPECT TO GET IT 
SAFE HE HIT IT SO BADLY THAT HE 
GOT THE WHITE RIGHT OVER THIS SIDE 
OF THE TABLE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
NEAR THE BLUE HE HIT IT ON THE 
RIGHT HAND SIDE HE WILL SETTLE FOR 
THE OUTCOME AS 
I SAY I DID SEE A 
WRY GRIN THIS FROM O'SULLIVAN AS HE 
WAS WALKING TO THE TABLE WHY 
GRIMNESS HE REALISED HE WAS NOT 
GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO CLINCH 
THE FRAME NOT ONLY THAT THIS HAS 
GIVEN HIM SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT 
THIS POSITION ALMOST A MINUTES' THINKING TIME 
IF THE IN OFF IS NOT ON THERE IS A 
POSSIBILITY THAT STEPHEN MIGHT 
THINK ABOUT BACK DOUBLING THIS 
IT IS THE DOUBLE HE HAS HAD A GO AT 
THAT WAS ALWAYS THE PROBLEM 
DON'T KNOW WHY IT STEPHEN DID NOT 
LOOK AT THAT HE JUST LOOKED AT THE 
DOUBLE AND DID NOT THINK ABOUT THE 
IN OFF 
WELL IT WAS A NATURAL IN OFF ANGLE AS IT PROVED SO HENDRY ONLY 
HAS HIMSELF TO BLAME FOR NOT 
RECOGNISING IT 
IF HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF STRAIGHT ON 
THE BLUE THAT IS A TERRIBLE SHOT 
NO PARK HE HAS AN ANGLE NO HE 
HAS AN ANKLE SO IT LOOKS LIKE 
FOUR EACH AN ANGLE WHAT A 
TERRIFIC SESSION OF SNOOKER WE 
HAVE HAD A BIT OF EVERYTHING 
WE HAVE HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY CLEARANCE FROM 
HENDRY 
A CENTURY FROM O'SULLIVAN THAT 
PINK CLINCHES THIS FRAME FOR HIM 
WE HAVE HAD A FEW MISTAKES TO SPICE 
IT UP 
AND SOME PRETTY GOOD 
TACTICAL PLAY WE HAVE HAD THE LOT 
THIS AFTERNOON 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN TRAILED FOUR TO ONE HE 
TOOK THE REMAINING THREE FRAMES OF 
THE AFTERNOON TO LEVEL AT FOUR EACH 
OVERNIGHT 
STEVE THAT SURELY HAS TO GO DOWN 
AS VERY GOOD RONNIE O'SULLIVAN RECOVERY 
YES L. DON'T THINK HE RECOVERY WILL BE PLEASED WITH IT BUT IT IS 
A JOB WELL DONE IN A WAY THIS IS 
NOT A CRITICISM OF RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN IN ANY WAY BUT THAT IS 
AS POORLY AS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN CAN 
PLAY AT THIS STAGE OF THE 
TOURNAMENT IT WAS STILL BRILLIANT 
BY THE WAY L. DON'T THINK HE CAN 
PLAY WORSE THAN THAT HE MISSED A 
FEW SHOTS BY HIS OWN HIGH STANDARDS 
AT ONE TO ZERO BEHIND THE CLEARANCE HE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN UPSET WITH HE DID 
NOT CONVERT MANY CHANCES YOU WILL 
NOT GET RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AS OFF AS 
THAT IN THE REST OF THE MATCH 
STEPHEN HENDRY MIGHT HAVE MISSED A 
TRICK NOT TO FORGE AHEAD L. AM 
BEING ULTRA CRITICAL OF BRILLIANT 
PLAYERS HENDRY WILL FEEL LIKE HE 
HAD AN ADVANTAGE AND DID NOT 
CONVERT IT O'SULLIVAN CAN FEEL 
HAPPY HE GOT BACK IN BUT HE WILL 
NOT BE HAPPY THAT HE DID NOT PLAY 
AS WELL AS THE CAN 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
HAS AMASSED FOUR FRAMES IN THIS AND 
THAT IS AS MANY AS HE MANAGED IN 
THE SEMI FINAL FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN 
HE LOST SEVENTEEN TO FOUR AGAINST RONNIE LOT OF 
PEOPLE WILL WONDER WHAT EFFECT THAT 
HAD ON HENDRY AT THE TIME AND HAVE 
WE SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OF A DECLINE 
SINCE THEN BECAUSE OF IT OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY IT HAS BEEN ASKED OF STEPHEN HENDRY 
IN AN INTERVIEW HE MENTIONED THE 
FACT THAT HE GOT A BATTERING BUT 
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS 
RECENT FORM WHICH HE SAYS HAS BEEN 
RUBBISH STEPHEN HENDRY'S RECENT 
FORM WHICH HAS BEEN IN AND OUT IS 
MORE A BUILD UP A DEBILITATING 
BUILD UP OF EASY MISTAKES THAT HAVE 
CREPT INTO HIS GAME AND HAS EATEN 
AWAY AT HIS LONG POTTING TECHNICAL 
PROBLEMS CAN SOMETIMES CREEPING 
YOU HAVE TO CORRECT THOSE AS 
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE CREEP IN HE 
HAS LOOKED A DIFFERENT PLAYER IN 
THIS TOURNAMENT L. DON'T THINK WE 
CAN LOOK BACK AT HIS PERFORMANCES 
THIS YEAR WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HIM 
AT THE MOMENT AND HE IS A MAJOR 
FORCE EVEN THOUGH HE HAS LEFT 
LET RONNIE OFF THE HOOK HE CAN 
STILL WIN 
THIS PITS A THIRTY NINE YEAR OLD 
AGAINST A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD AS CLIVE 
SAID THERE HAS NOT BEEN A WINNER 
THAT HAS BEEN THIRTY ONE OR OLDER SINCE 
NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY THE 
ONLY GUY WHO CAN DO THIS IS TWENTY EIGHT 
YEAR OLD ALI CARTER MAYBE THE 
STAKES ARE MOVING IN FAVOUR OF THE 
OLDER PLAYERS 
POSSIBLY THERE HAVE 
BEEN A LOT OF GOOD PLAYERS AROUND 
TWENTY THREE OR TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS WHO HAVE BEEN 
THERE OR THEREABOUTS STEPHEN 
HENDRY DOES NOT LOOK FINISHED IN 
THE GAME RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS 
NOWHERE NEAR FINISHED THIS IS A 
GREAT CHANCE FOR RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
IF HE CONVERTS THIS INTO A WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP VICTORY IT WILL BE 
THREE TIMES TO GO AHEAD AND WIN IT 
A COUPLE MORE TIMES BEFORE EASY 
BEFORE HE IS OVER THE HILL TO PUT 
HIMSELF IN THE BRACKETS OF ONE OF 
THE LEGENDS IF HE IS NOT ALREADY 
IF STEPHEN HENDRY WINS THIS MATCH 
WOW TO WIN IT EIGHT TIMES AFTER 
EVERYBODY THOUGHT PERHAPS HIS LAST 
VICTORY WAS TOO MANY YEARS AGO 
THAT WOULD BE PHENOMENAL FOR 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN THIS IS A BIG 
CHANCE TO FORGE AHEAD 
STORY LINES 
EVERYWHERE IN THE SEMI FINAL AND 
THE OTHER ONE BEFORE WE GET TOO 
CARRIED AWAY WITH THIS ONE THAT IS 
ONLY THE FIRST SESSION JOHN 
PARROTT HAS GONE ARTY ON US HE IS 
CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF TOM

STARTED PLAYING SNOOKER WITH MY 
GRANDAD WHEN I WAS ABOUT ELEVEN THEY 
STARTED HOLDING SCOTTISH UNDER FOURTEEN 
TOURNAMENTS WON ALL OF THOSE TOURNAMENTS WAS ALWAYS QUITE 
COCKY BUT I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO 
DO SOMETHING IN THE GAME HAD A 
LOT OF SELF BELIEF BACK THEN MY 
MUM SUPPORTED ME ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SHE TRIED 
TO GET ME INTO SCHOOL A LITTLE BIT 
MORE THAN MY DAD DID THINK SHE 
KNEW THAT I HAD LOST ALL INTEREST 
IN SCHOOL JUST LOVED SNOOKER 
THANKFULLY SHE BELIEVED I COULD 
ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING IN THE GAME 
I WAS ALWAYS PLAYING SNOOKER IF I 
HAD SCHOOL DURING THE DAY THE ONLY 
TIME TO PLAY WAS AT NIGHT TIME 
USED TO THINK I WAS MISSING A LOT 
I WENT TO THE AGE WHEN I COULD GO 
TO THE PUB MYSELF WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN 
HAVE HAD GOOD TIME MYSELF AND 
SHANNON MET SIX YEARS AGO L. WAS 
MEMBER AT THE FITNESS CENTRE WHERE 
SHANNON WAS A RECEPTIONIST SHE 
WILL PROBABLY TELL YOU DIFFERENT 
STORY BUT SHE CHASED ME MY SON WAS 
BORN AND THE HOUSE WAS IN UPROAR 
IT WAS THE BEST FEELING DON'T 
ONE THING TO PLAY SNOOKER THERE 
ARE OTHER SPORTS LIKE TENNIS 
SNOOKER GOLF MY SON TO PLAY 
SNOOKER L. THINK IF YOU ASKED 
SHARON IF HUME RECOMMENDED 
MARRYING A SNOOKER PLAYER SHE 
WOULD SAY THE BEST ONE IS TAKEN 
IF YOU RECOMMENDED 
HAPPY FAMILIES FOR STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
HE WAS UP AGAINST WORLD NO EIGHTEEN JOE 
PERRY LAST NIGHT A PROFESSIONAL 
FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS YET TO WIN A TITLE ON 
HIS CRUCIBLE DEBUT HE KNOCKED OUT A 
CERTAIN STEVE DAVIS 
IT WAS A JOKE WHO HELD A FOUR TO ZERO LEAD 
EARLY IN THE MATCH BUT BY LAST 
NIGHT IT HAD BECOME A BLOW FOR BLOW 
AFFAIR IT WAS JOE 
NEAL FOULDS AND WILLIE THORNE 
WATCHING 
JOE PERRY WHATEVER YOU GET MY 
FRIEND YOU DESERVE THAT WAS 
OUTSTANDING UNDER PRESSURE 
OUTSTANDING PERHAPS A LITTLE 
UNLUCKY NOT TO GET A BETTER ANGLE 
ON THE BLACK TO BE ABLE TO DO 
SOMETHING ON THE CUE BALL THAT WAS 
OUTSTANDING 
HE DESERVED A GOOD CASE WELL 
PLAYED GOOD CASE KISS THAT THAT WAS A BRILLIANT SHOT GREAT CUE 
POWER 
THE BOTTOM RED IN THE PACK WILL POT 
INTO THE RIGHT HAND CORNER AS WE 
LOOK HE CAN SCREW FROM THE YELLOW 
IN A STRAIGHT LINE BETWEEN BLUE AND 
PINK HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ON 
TO THIS RED HE DECIDED TO GO INTO 
THEM AGAIN WHICH WAS NOT A BAD 
CHOICE 
HE WAS UNLUCKY AGAIN THERE HE GOT 
BACK INTO THE FRAME THERE IS A RED 
AVAILABLE INTO THE GREEN POCKET HE 
COULD CUT IT INTO THE MIDDLE YOU 
WOULD BE LEAVING THE RED ON IF YOU 
MISS THIS SHOT 
HE HAS PLAYED THREE OR FOUR 
FANTASTIC SHOTS 
IN SOME WAYS YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY 
HE DESERVES TO BE ELEVEN TO ELEVEN THE LAST 
THE WAY HE HAS PLAYED IN THESE 
LAST FLURRY OF SHOTS ELEVEN TO ELEVEN 
THEN HASN'T THIS BEEN A GREAT 
MATCH EVERY FRAME COULD HAVE GONE 
EITHER WAY 
ELEVEN N. T. S. IN FRONT TO BE CERTAIN HE NEEDS ALL FOUR REDS 
IT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN A SPECIAL 
BREAK THIS NOT YET A FRAME WINNER 
BUT NOT A MILLION MILES AWAY FROM 
BEING ONE RIGHT WHEN IT LOOK LIKE 
HE WAS GOING TO DO IT IT LOOKED 
LIKE WE HAVE SEEN STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
CLEAR UP WHEN HE HAS BEEN BEHIND 
THERE IS A CHANCE OF THE OTHER WAY 
THERE WAS A CHANCE JUST HIT THE 
NEAR JAW 
IT IS ANOTHER BREAK OF FIFTY WE HAVE 
SEEN ANY NUMBER OF THOSE KIND OF 
BREAKS WHICH HAVE NOT CLINCHED THE 
FRAME FOR JOE TODAY WILL WE SEE IT 
AGAIN ARE THOSE TWO ROADS LINED UP 
TOWARDS THE CENTRE L. THINK THEY ARE TWO REDS 
IS THIS GOING TO BE ANOTHER FRAME 
THAT STEPHEN MAGUIRE PINCHES JOE 
ONLY HAS HIMSELF TO BLAME YOU 
WOULD HAVE EXPECTED HIM TO POT THE 
RED IN THE MIDDLE IT HAS BEEN 
VERY VERY GOOD MATCH THE ONLY 
THING MISSING IS ONE FRAME UP 
VISITS EVERY SINGLE FRAME COULD 
HAVE GONE EITHER WAY ONE FRAME 
IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS HELD THE SPOT 
TO GIVE HIMSELF MORE ROOM WITH HIS 
BRIDGING HAND 
WELL WHATEVER COLOUR MAGUIRE TAKES 
WITH THIS RED HE IS CHECKING THE 
SCORES IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IN 
THAT HE WILL NEED THE PINK WHICH 
IS TRICKY IT IS NOT LIKE HE CAN 
JUST PLAY ON THE BLACK AND GET TOO 
MANY IN FRONT THE GREEN IS ALSO 
NOT VERY FAR AWAY FROM THE CUSHION 
EITHER EVEN THOUGH THE PATTERN HAS 
BEEN THERE ALL DAY WITH FIFTY BREAKS 
NOT WINNING FRAMES FOR PERRY IT IS 
NOT QUITE AT THAT STAGE YET STILL 
WORK TO DO IT WOULD BE SOME 
CLEARANCE FROM HERE 
NOT TOO SURE 
WHETHER HE HAS THE PERFECT ANGLE 
HERE THE BROWN IS WHERE HE WOULD 
LIKE THE CUE BALL TO FINISH HE HAS 
GOT A SLIGHT ANGLE HE HAS TO MAKE 
SURE HE GETS INSIDE THE BROWN 
THOUGH LOOK AT THE KICK HE HAS 
GOT 
UNBELIEVABLE UNBELIEVABLE MAGUIRE 
HAS HAD TWO OF THE BIGGEST KICKS I 
HAVE EVER SEEN 
WHAT A REPRIEVE THAT IS FOR JOE 
PERRY 
THAT WAS LIKE TWO LUMPS OF ROCK 
WASN'T IT HITTING EACH OTHER 
DON'T THINK HE CAN STILL BELIEVE IT 
HE WAS GOING SO WELL MASSIVE KICK NEAR ENOUGH 
GREEN TO BROWN WAS GOING TO BE 
TOUGH FOR MAGUIRE IT WAS JUST AS 
TOUGH FOR PERRY 
JUST THE BLUE NOW TO LEVEL I THINK 
THIS TO BE FAIR IS THE FIRST 
FRAME JOE PERRY HAS PINCHED IT 
WILL HURT MAGUIRE BECAUSE IT LOOKED 
FOR ALL MONEY HE WAS COMING TO GO 
TWELVE TO TEN IN FRONT ALBEIT JOE HAD THE 
FIRST CHANCE TO WIN THE FRAME HE 
WAS GOING TO GO 
THERE HAS BEEN A BREAK OF FIFTY AND 
ABOVE IN EVERY SINGLE FRAME 
WHAT A TOPSY TURVY FRAME THAT WAS 
WE ARE STILL NO NEARER TO KNOWING 
WHO IS GOING TO WIN THIS MATCH 
THESE PLAYERS LAST MET IN THE 
OPENING ROUND AT THE CRUCIBLE LAST 
YEAR STEPHEN WON EASILY BY TEN TO THREE 
BUT JOE WILL NOT GO QUIETLY THIS 
TIME INTO THE NEXT AND PERRY IS 
FORTY TWO POINTS IN ARREARS GREAT SHOT GREAT SHOT 
HE HAD TO PURSE THAT HE HAD TO 
PUSH THAT RED ON AND OFF THE 
CUSHION HE IS O. K. 
AWKWARD CUEING HE DIDN'T REALLY 
WANT TO GO OVER THE TOP OF THAT RED 
BUT HE HAD NO CHOICE ARE WE GOING 
TO SEE A REAL TURNAROUND WE HAVE 
SEEN ANY NUMBER OF FRAMES WHERE JOE 
PERRY HAS MADE FIFTY OR MORE AND LOST 
THIS TIME MAGUIRE GOT IN WITH FIFTY 
THIS WOULD BE BIG TURNAROUND HE HAS A LOT TO DO THOUGH 
IF HE GETS THREE HIGH VALUE COLOURS 
HE WILL NOT NEED THE PINK HE HAS 
TO BE CAREFUL HE DOES NOT TAKE LOW 
VALUE COLOURS OF THESE LAST TWO 
REDS AT THIS MOMENT HE IS 
FAVOURITE TO GO TWELVE TO ELEVEN 
JOE HAS JUST HAD A LOOK AT THE 
SCORES HIGH COLOURS HERE 
NORMALLY YOU WOULD SEE A PLAYER 
JUST ROLL THIS IN AND GET ON THE 
RED TO PLAYED THE BLUE BUT I DON'T 
THINK JOE WANTS TO DO THAT HERE 
PLAY THE BLUE WELL HE HAS GOT THE 
ANGLE NOW HE HAS GOT TO PLAY ON 
THE BLACK WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR 
NOT 
I THINK THE LAST BLACK CAME OFF THE 
CUSHION A BIT QUICKLY THAT PUT THE 
POINTS ALL SQUARE NEEDS AN ANGLE 
HE IS BLESSED WITH DECENT CUE POWER 
JOE BUT NOT AS GOOD AS SOME OF THE 
PLAYERS SO A LOT OF REVERSE SIDE 
NEEDED HERE 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT HE CAN POT IT 
BUT WITHOUT THE KISS ON THE BLUE 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THIS 
IS TRICKY 
WELL THE PLOT THICKENS THE ONE 
MACRO LEAD THAT PARIS HAD ACTUALLY 
WAS SIGNIFICANT BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
ONE POINT LEAD THAT PERRY HAD THAT 
IS ONE OF THE SHOTS IN THIS MATCHES 
ONE OF THE FEW SHOTS IN THIS 
MATCH MISSED WITH THE REST HE IS 
VERY CONSISTENT IN THAT DEPARTMENT 
THE REASON NEAL SAID IT WAS 
SIGNIFICANT IS THAT HE WILL BE THIRTEEN 
IN FRONT ON THE PINK 
THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT SHOT A LOT 
OF CHECK SIDE PLAYED TO KEEP THE 
CUE BALL AWAY FROM RUNNING INTO THE 
PINK WHICH IT WOULD HAVE DONE 
PLAYING BALL PLAIN BALL THE 
TWISTS AND TURNS IN THIS MATCH 
INCREDIBLE BROWN AND BLUE TO BE THIRTEEN 
IN FRONT L. WOULD IMAGINE IF THE 
CANNON ON THE PINK IS NOT ON HE 
WILL HAVE A GO AT THE DOUBLE ON THE 
PINK IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE ANGLE 
HE GETS ON THE BLUE AS TO WHETHER 
HE PLAYS TO GET ON THE DOUBLE OR TO 
MOVE THE PINK OUT 
HE HAS ALMOST PLAYED ON THE BLUE AS 
IF IT WAS ON HIS SPOT ITS SPOT 
SO HE HAS GONE A FRACTION TOO FAR 
THIS IS SHOT HE WANTS TO SEE GO 
IN THIRTEEN WILL BE THE DIFFERENCE IF HE 
CAN ROLL THIS BLUE IN SO THAT IS 
HIS PRIORITY AND HE CAN'T DO 
ANYTHING ELSE EITHER HE CAN'T PLAY 
ANY KIND OF SHOT TO GET ON THE PINK 
AT ALL SO MAKE SURE OF IT 
THIS IS A QUESTION ISN'T IT WHAT 
DO YOU DO HERE THE SAFETY IS ONLY 
EASY IF HE CAN HIT IT WITHOUT 
GETTING THE DOUBLE KISS 
HE PLAYED THE PINK IN BEHIND THE 
BLACK AND PLAYED IT VERY WELL 
GOOD SHOT L. DIDN'T THINK HE WOULD 
GET IT THAT WAY ROUND AND MISS THE 
DOUBLE KISS 
WHAT ABOUT THAT FOR A SHOT 
ABSOLUTE CLASS L. SUPPOSE HE 
THOUGHT IF HE MISSED IT ON THE WAY 
UP THERE HE WOULD PROBABLY CATCH 
IT ON THE WAY BACK IT WAS UNLIKELY 
HE WOULD MISS ALTOGETHER BUT A 
TERRIFIC SHOT ALL THE SAME 
HE DECIDED NOT TO TRY AND GET THE 
SNOOKER IN BEHIND THE BLACK THE 
DOUBLE IS NOT ON HE HAS GOT A GOOD 
WHITE THIS IS NOT EASY TO GET SAFE 
HE DIDN'T PLAY THAT THE VERY WELL 
PRIORITY HAD TO BE TO GET THE PINK 
GET THE PINK CERTAINLY A LONG WAY 
AWAY FROM THE POCKET I'M NOT 
SAYING THIS IS EASY BECAUSE IT 
ISN'T BUT IT IS CHANCE AND HE HAS TO PLAY IT 
WELL THAT WAS VERY VERY WELL 
STRUCK INDEED HE PUTS HIS CUE DOWN 
JOE PERRY DISAPPOINTED IT IS FRAME TO STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
JUST ONE MORE FRAME NEEDED FOR THE 
SEMI FINALS SEMI FINALS YES A PLACE IN THE SEMIS FOR THE 
SECOND SUCCESSIVE TIME HE GOT 
THERE ONLY TO BE BEATEN BY JOHN 
HIGGINS WHO WENT ON TO WIN THE 
TITLE IN THE NEXT THE SCOT IS 
AHEAD BY TWENTY ONE POINTS 
OH MY WORD JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING 
THAT COULD GO WRONG ON THAT SHOT 
HAS REDS GOING ALL OVER THE PLACE 
ONE OVER A POCKET ONE IN OPEN PLAY 
THIS IS NOT ONE MAGUIRE WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE AGAIN A MILE AWAY FROM THE 
POT 
WELL ARE WE GOING TO GET ANOTHER 
LAST FRAME FIGHT OUT HERE AT THE 
CRUCIBLE PERRY FAVOURITE TO GET 
BACK INTO THE FRAME THERE IS 
PLENTY OF WORK TO DO YET THOUGH 
BEFORE YOU WOULD CONSIDERATE TO BE 
A FRAME WINNING OPPORTUNITY 
CONSIDER IT 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE IS GOING TO 
RISK PLAYING IT SLOW WITH A BIT OF 
A CHECK SIDE TO PLAY THE PINK IN 
THE MIDDLE IF HE DECIDES TO PLAY 
THIS STUN ACROSS THE TABLE THERE 
ARE A LOT OF BALLS TO AVOID KISSING 
IN TWO IN TWO HE PLAYED FOR 
PINK OR BLACK AND HE IS A BIT 
BETWIXT AND BETWEEN HE IS NOT ON 
EITHER OF THEM NICELY HE HAS LEFT 
THE EXTENSION ON OH HE HAS TAKEN 
IT OFF HE CAN REACH IT WITHOUT THE 
EXTENSION WITH THE REST I 
WOULDN'T FANCY HIM KNOCKING THIS 
BLACK IN WITHOUT THE REST I WOULD 
MUST BE TOUCH AND GO WHETHER HE IS 
ON THIS MAYBE HE CAN JUST GET TO 
IT PAST THE BLACK 
WITH THE COUPLE OF AWKWARD REDS HE 
CAN BUILD UP QUITE GOOD LEAD 
A COUPLE OF REDS WITH HIGH 
COLOURS THE FRAME WILL NOT BE 
ONE BUT IT WILL HELP HIM BECAUSE 
THE TWO REDS BEEN SAVED IT WILL 
PROBABLY TAKE A COUPLE OF VISITS TO 
CLEAR UP THE TWO REDS BEING SAFE 
HE COULD PLAY THE PINK IN THE 
CENTRE IF HE WANTS PROBABLY THE 
BEST SHOT REALLY THE MOST SIMPLE 
SHOT FOR THE NEXT RED 
SOME PLAYERS DON'T LIKE PLAYING 
REDS INTO REDS BUT THERE IS SO 
MUCH MILEAGE IN THIS SHOT HE NEEDS 
TWO MORE REDS AND TWO MORE PICK 
COLOURS TO GET A LEAD WHICH COULD 
BE ENOUGH BIG COLOURS O. K. HE 
COULD GO WRONG DOUBLE KISS IT DOWN 
THE CUSHION OR NOT GET ON A COLOUR 
BUT THERE WAS PLENTY OF VALUE IN 
TRYING TO KNOCK ONE OF THESE REDS A 
BIT MORE INTO PLAY 
I SUPPOSE THAT WAS THE DOWNSIDE 
THAT THERE WAS A BIT OF A GAP 
BEHIND THE TWO REDS HE IS ANNOYED NOW 
MAYBE HAD TO MAKE HIS MIND UP WHICH 
RED HE WAS GOING TO HIT THEIR 
RATHER THAN JUST PLAYING TO THAT 
GENERAL AREA WHICH I THINK HE MAY 
HAVE DONE 
HE HAD TO BE CAREFUL WITH THAT 
COULD HAVE GONE ANYWHERE 
SHEER GOOD FORTUNE HE HAD NO IDEA 
ABOUT THAT AT ALL 
HE IS BRINGING PINK BACK INTO PLAY 
BECAUSE HE IS A FEW POINTS BEHIND 
EITHER OF THESE THIN SAFETY SHOTS 
HE HAS TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF THE 
DOUBLE KISS 
AS PLAYED HE PLAYED CUSHION FIRST 
BECAUSE HE HAS PLAYED CUSHION FIRST 
HE WILL NOT HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL 
OF IDEA WHERE THE CUE BALL WAS 
GOING TO END UP L. SUPPOSE A LITTLE 
FORTUNATE TO GET THE SNOOKER HE 
CAN SEE THE LEFT HAND RED BUT HOW 
DOES HE GET SAFE FROM THAT 
IT FLICKED THE OTHER RED THAT IS 
THE REASON THE WHITE IS NOT ON THE 
BACK CUSHION 
THERE COULD BE HALF A CHANCE HERE 
I THINK STEVEN WILL BE INTERESTED 
IN THIS RED ON TOP RIGHT IF IT 
GOES IN HE WILL PROBABLY GET 
SHOT TO PLAY ON TO THE OTHER RED 
FOR MAYBE THE BLUE OR EVEN THE 
GREEN THIS COULD BE BIG SHOT 
YOU SEE THE SHOT HE IS LEFT WITH 
HE IS A FEW POINTS BEHIND BUT WITH 
THE COLOURS OUT IN THE OPEN IT IS 
NOT A VERY BIG ADVANTAGE THAT PERRY 
HAS 
NOT EVEN CLOSE AND HE HAS LEFT THE 
RED 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR QUITE 
SOME TIME I HAVE SEEN STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE MISSED A FEW PRESSURE SHOTS 
THAT IS ADRENALIN FOR YOU HE 
OVERHIT THAT BY ABOUT THREE FEET 
BUT IT STILL KEPT IT'S STILL CUTS 
IN THE MIDDLE 
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT TO COME INSIDE 
THE GREEN TWENTY THREE IN FRONT RED AND 
SIZEABLE COLOUR FOR TWELVE TO TWELVE 
I THINK 
IT IS MISSABLE THOUGH THIS IT IS 
NOT BE TACKLEY RIGHT OVER THE 
POCKET NOT EXACTLY GOOD SHOT 
THE SPECTATORS HAVE REALISED THAT 
IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GOING TO BE 
HEADING FOR A DECIDER DIFFERENCE 
OF TWENTY NINE POINTS 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE SCOREBOARD HE 
KNOWS TWENTY NINE IS THE DIFFERENCE ONE 
SNOOKER SO BARRING A SNOOKER IT 
WILL BE TWELVE TO TWELVE 
IT WAS SO WE HAD THE FIRST FINAL 
FRAME DECIDER OF THE QUARTER FINALS 
IN THIS WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP LET'S 
GET INTO IT MAGUIRE WITH A BIT TO 
DO THIRTY TWO POINTS BEHIND 
WELL HE MOVED ON THAT A BIT OF 
MOVEMENT BEFORE HE PLAYED THE SHOT 
IT IS ALL ABOUT THE PRESSURE 
DEFINITELY A BIT OF MOVEMENT THERE 
CAN'T BLAME HIM FOR THAT BUT HE 
BASHED THE TABLE IN FRUSTRATION 
SO HE DID AT LEAST HAVE HIS CHANCE 
IN THIS FRAME HE MAY NOT GET 
ANOTHER THOUGH WHERE THE BALLS 
ARE THAT MIGHT PICK IT NOW 
THAT 
MIGHT BE IT NOW JOE PERRY HAS A 
CHANCE TO GET TO THE SEMI FINAL OF 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP FOR THE 
FIRST TIME AND HE WILL NOT GET THE 
BETTER ONE A BETTER ONE 
HE GOT VERY CLOSE TO THE BLACK HIS 
HEART MUST HAVE SKIPPED A BEAT 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE PLAYED UNBELIEVABLE 
SNOOKER IN THE LAST THE FIRST TWO 
ROUNDS EIGHT TO ZERO IN FRONT AGAINST 
HAMILTON NINE TO ZERO IN FRONT AGAINST 
ROBERTSON HE MAY HAVE BURNED 
HIMSELF OUT A BIT HE HAD SPELLS IN 
THIS MATCH WHERE HE LOOKED LIKE HE 
WAS GOING TO PLAY WELL BUT ON 
REFLECTION LOOKING AT ALL TWENTY FIVE 
FRAMES JOE PERRY HAS CERTAINLY 
BEEN THE AGGRESSOR ON REFLECTION 
I THINK HE JUST ABOUT DESERVED TO 
WIN DESERVES IT IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
HE IS ON THE BLUE THIS MATCH IS AS 
GOOD AS OVER STEPHEN MAGUIRE AS 
WILLIE SAID AND WE SPOKE ABOUT 
EARLIER STARTED HIS CAMPAIGN 
TREMENDOUSLY WELL BUT HE CAN'T 
REALLY COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS RESULT 
IN THE END PERRY COULD HAVE WON A 
LOT OF RISK A LOT OF FRAMES THAT 
HE COULD HAVE WON BUT HE IS COMING 
TO WIN THE MATCH HE HAS PLAYED 
EXTREMELY WELL TONIGHT GOING TO 
WIN THE MATCH 
THAT WAS JOE PERRY JUST BLOWING A 
KISS TO HIS ARMY OF FRIENDS THAT 
HAVE COME FANS THAT HAVE COME 
FROM THE CAMBRIDGE AREA TO WATCH 
THIS MATCH THIS IS WHEN YOU GET 
THE ADRENALIN OUT IT IS LOVELY 
WHEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE WON THE 
MATCH WHICH IS PROBABLY THE 
BIGGEST OF HIS CAREER IF YOU GET 
TO THE SEMI FINAL AT THE CRUCIBLE 
IT IS HUGE 
IT HAS BEEN A VERY GOOD STANDARD 
THIS EVENING BREAKS OF FIFTY AND 
ABOVE IN VIRTUALLY EVERY FRAME A 
LOT OF FRAMES COULD HAVE GONE 
EITHER WAY WE STARTED WITH A BREAK 
OF THIRTY THREE WHEN HE MISSED THE CANNON 
FROM BLUE TO REDS I THOUGHT HE MAY 
HAVE MISSED THE BOAT MAGUIRE HAS 
HAD TWO GOOD CHANCES IN THIS FRAME 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PRESSURE 
WAS JUST TOO MUCH ON THE DAY HE 
WILL BE BACK HE IS A GREAT PLAYER 
COULD HAVE BEEN NUMBER ONE IF HE 
HAD GOT FURTHER THAN O'SULLIVAN IN 
THIS TOURNAMENT THAT WILL NOT BE 
THE CASE NOW O'SULLIVAN LOOKS SURE 
TO BE THE WORLD NUMBER ONE IT 
DESERVED TO GO TWELVE TO TWELVE THE CROWD 
HAVE STAYED WITH THIS MATCH TILL 
LATE ON JOE PERRY KEPT HIS BOTTLED 
WHEN HE NEEDED TO AND HE IS INTO 
THE SEMI FINAL 
MAGNIFICENT FROM JOE PERRY FIRST 
TIME IN THE SEMIS BUT ALSO WILLIE 
THORNE MENTIONED THAT STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE'S VICTORY WAS VERY COSTLY 
FOR HIM AND HE LOST THE CHANCE OF 
BEING WORLD NUMBER ONE RONNIE HAS 
DEFINITELY GOT THAT THE FIRST TIME 
ANYBODY HAS DONE THAT FOR THE THIRD 
TIME IN THEIR CAREER FIRST JOE 
PERRY'S ACHIEVEMENT HOW DO YOU 
RATE THAT 
VERY GOOD IT IS THE 
BIGGEST MATCH SIMPLY THAT HE IS 
IN THE SEMI FINAL OF THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS WHEN IT HAS COME 
CLOSE NEAR THE END OF HIS MATCHES 
HE HAS LOOKED THE RE CONFIDENT AND 
ASSURED SOMETIMES IN THE PAST HE 
HAS NOT LOOKED QUITE AS ASSURED HE HE IS ONE OF THOSE PLAYERS WHO HAS 
ALWAYS LOOKED LIKE HE IS GOING TO 
FULFIL HIS POTENTIAL AND HAS NEVER 
DONE SO 
WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN HOW 
GOOD A PLAYER HE IS BUT THERE ARE A 
LOT OF GREAT PLAYERS AROUND WHO ARE 
IN DANGER OF BECOMING JOURNEY MAN 
PLAYERS BECAUSE THERE ARE BETTER 
PLAYERS AROUND YOU COULD ARGUE 
THAT JOE PERRY WAS GOING TO BE ONE 
OF THOSE THIS CHANGES THE EQUATION 
SOMEWHAT AND CAN BE USED AS A 
SPRINGBOARD FOR THE REST OF HIS 
CAREER 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE STORM CAREER FORCED MAGUIRE RATHER BLEW HIMSELF 
OUT IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF ROUNDS 
HE CAME HERE ABSOLUTELY ON FIRE 
FROM BALL ONE HE LED AND ANTHONY 
HAMILTON SEVEN TO ZERO THEN IT NINE TO ZERO AGAINST 
NEIL ROBERTSON PLAYING 
FRIGHTENINGLY WELL PERHAPS HE 
PUNCHED HIMSELF OUT BIT 
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BUILD UP TO 
PLAYING YOUR BEST POSSIBLY POSSIBLY ALTHOUGH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
INTERESTING HAD HE NOT GOT THAT BAD 
KICK ON THE BLUE HOW THE MATCH 
WOULD HAVE PANNED OUT IF YOU 
LEAVE IT CLOSE IF A MATCH BUT 
CLOSE YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN TOO MUCH 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM HALF OF 
THIS DRAW WHO WOULD HAVE PICKED 
IT ALI CARTER AND JOE PERRY TO 
EMERGE FROM THE LIKES OF THE GUYS 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MAGUIRE 
MURPHY SELBY AT GIPTON ALL IN THAT 
HALF THE BEAUTY OF SPORT AND 
EBDON 
NOBODY WOULD HAVE PREDICTED EBDON THIS OUTCOME AN EXCITING MATCH 
AHEAD FOR BOTH SEMI FINALS BOTH 
ALI CARTER AND JOE PERRY A GREAT 
CHANCE FOR BOTH 
ALI CARTER CAME IN 
THIS MORNING FOR A LOOK AROUND I I WAS DOING SOME FILMING HE SAT IN 
THE CHAIR AND SAID THIS IS 
DIFFERENT HE WILL SETTLE DOWN 
AFTER A FEW BALLS BUT IT IS 
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU GET DOWN THERE 
FROM THE TWO TABLE SITUATIONS A A BIG NIGHT FOR BOTH MEN 
AND TOUGH 
ONE TO PREDICT 
THAT IS MET TONIGHT 
SEVEN P. M. RAY WILL BE IN THE CHAIR 
INCIDENTALLY FOUR TO FOUR BETWEEN RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN AND STEPHEN HENDRY THEY 
WILL BE BACK TOMORROW WE WISH ALI 
CARTER AND JOE PERRY WELL THE 
SEEDING WE LEAVE YOU WITH MEMORIES 
OF THE VERY POPULAR WELSHMAN DOUG 
MOUNTJOY BYE BYE FOR NOW 
WHERE ARE YOU BABY BY 
BETTY BOO
