O. K. LET'S MEET TODAY'S QUICKIE BAG CHALLENGER 
THIS IS ALEX BARLOW FROM SHEFFIELD WHO IS A BEER FLAVOUR CONSULTANT EXPLAIN TO US WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT 
AS A FLAVOUR SPECIALIST I WORK WITH BREWERS 
AND TRAIN THEM IN DIFFERENT BEER STYLES AND FLAVOURS 
HELP THEM TO IMPROVE THEIR PRODUCTS 
I PRESENT I WRITE AND I TRAIN PEOPLE 
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING SO WHAT MAKES A DIFFERENT BEER VARIETY SO DIFFERENT THEN 
THE KEY DIFFERENCE IS THE YEAST 
IT CAN BE ALL THE INGREDIENTS 
SO WHETHER THEY USE MALT MAIZE RICE ETC 
AND PARTICULARLY THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF HOPS AND HOW MUCH YOU ADD OF EACH ONE 
BUT THERE'S SUCH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT BEERS OUT THERE 
THAT YOU CAN MATCH PRETTY MUCH ANY FOOD WHICH I THINK IS REALLY EXCITING 
A GOOD OLD FAVOURITE ENGLISH FISH AND CHIPS BRILLIANT WITH BLOND ALE 
YOU'VE GOT THINGS LIKE SPICY PILSNER HERBY PILSNER SOMETHING LIKE THAT WITH CHICKEN 
WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE DO YOU LIKE A FRUITY BEER 
I LIKE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT STYLES AND FLAVOURS OF BEER 
PROBABLY THE BEST THING IS CHEESE THERE'S SO MANY VARIETIES OF CHEESE 
AND SO MANY DIFFERENT BEERS THERE'S ALWAYS A MATCH SOMEWHERE 
YOU CAN RAMP THE FLAVOUR OF THE CHEESE UP AND THE FLAVOUR OF THE BEER 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR BAG COME ACROSS AND HAVE A TRY IN A MOMENT

WE'VE GOT PEPPER 
SOME QUICK COOK SPAGHETTI 
SPRING ONIONS MANGO AND THOSE LOVELY PRAWNS 
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THIS LITTLE LOT 
I'D DRINK THIS ONE 
I'VE DONE QUITE A BIT OF RESEARCH INTO THIS SO IT'S INTERESTING 
I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE COOKING WITH BEER I FIND IT'S QUITE BITTER 
SO I WILL PROBABLY STIR FRY THE SPAGHETTI WITH SOME OF THE ONION 
I MIGHT EVEN USE THAT TO WASH OUT THE PAN 
TO GIVE BEER FLAVOUR TO THE NOODLES 
THEN WE WILL PERHAPS SAUTE THE PRAWN TAILS WITH SOME MANGO AND PEPPER 
DRINK THIS ONE 
THEN WE'LL SMASH UP THE HEADS AND MAKE A BIT OF EXTRA SAUCE 
TO GO OVER THE SPAGHETTI 
USE THESE LIKE A DEGLAZE 
DEGLAZE THE PAN THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING 
EVERYBODY LIKES THE IDEA OF THAT THAT'S YOUR RED BUTTON 
WHAT ABOUT YOU LES A BEER TEMPURA OR SOMETHING 
YEAH I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY ACTUALLY 
PRAWN TEMPURA AND THEN MAYBE MAKE 
A LOVELY MANGO AND CHILLI SALSA TO GO WITH THE TEMPURA 
SO YOU'VE GOT DEEP FRIED THEN LIMEY MANGO SALSA TO GO WITH THAT 
I MIGHT JUST TRY AND COOK WITH THAT AND REDUCE IT RIGHT DOWN AND GET 
LOTS OF SPRING ONION AND HERBS IN THERE AND A LITTLE BIT OF CREAM 
THEN MAYBE FLAVOUR WITH SOME PRAWNS 
AND DO A SORT OF PASTA STYLE DISH 
WITH IT AND DRINK THE REST MAYBE PUT THE HEADS IN THERE 
THAT WILL BE QUITE INTERESTING
