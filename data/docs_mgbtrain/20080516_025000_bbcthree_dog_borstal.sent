BUDDY IS A BULLY WHO TREATS OWNER SAM LIKE HIS BITCH 
YOU THINK WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER IF HE ACCIDENTALLY GETS RUN OVER 
RUFF AND TUMBLE ARE TWO TINY DOGS WITH ONE GREAT BIG HIT LIST 
I'M SHAKING NOW LOOK 
THE OWNERS OF THESE DOGS ARE AT THEIR WITS' END 
IT'S TIME FOR EXTREME MEASURES 
THIS IS THE LAST RESORT FOR BAD DOGS 
SET UP ON A SECURE TEN ACRE COMPOUND IN A REMOTE PART OF THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
DOG BORSTAL IS RUN BY THREE OF BRITAIN'S TOUGHEST TRAINERS 
NEVER MET A DOG I CAN'T TRAIN 
EACH TRAINER WILL TAKE ON SEPARATE DOGS IN AN ATTEMPT TO REFORM THEM IN JUST FOUR DAYS 
USING THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL TRAINING METHODS 
I'M TALKING TO YOU 
MY GOAL IS TO SHIFT THE POWER BALANCE BACK IN FAVOUR OF THE OWNER 
BUT THE OWNERS HAVE TO FACE HARSH TRUTHS 
YOUR DOG STARTED IT 
YOU COULD BE PROSECUTED UNDER THE DANGEROUS DOGS ACT 
FOR THESE DOGS THEIR DELINQUENT WAYS ARE ABOUT TO COME TO AN END 
THIS IS BUDDY A BEAGLE CROSS 
WHOSE OWNER SAM RESCUED HIM FROM A DOGS' HOME 
SAM DREAMED OF A MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN 
INSTEAD SHE'S FOUND HERSELF TRAPPED IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP 
STOP IT BUDDY 
LEAVE IT 
IF HE WAS A HUMAN HE'D BE A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD YOB 
WITH A HOODY ON A BASEBALL CAP ON AND GO AROUND STEALING CARS 
RUNNING OUT BUT BECAUSE HE HELPS HIS MUM WITH THE SHOPPING EVERYBODY THINKS HE'S WONDERFUL 
THE SECOND I SAY GET OUT HIS EYES GLAZE OVER 
HE RELAXES INTO HIS I'M GOING TO STAY HERE MOOD 
AND AS SOON AS I GET NEAR HIM HE SNARLS 
AND TURNS TO I'M GOING TO ROLL ON THE FLOOR YOU'LL NOT GET ME OUT OF THIS ROOM 
BUDDY CONTROLS EVERY INCH OF THE HOUSE 
THIS WEEK I'VE PROBABLY HAD FOUR FIVE HOURS' SLEEP A NIGHT SO FAR 
YOU JUST GET USED TO SLEEPING IN AWKWARD POSITIONS 
AND IN BUDDY'S WORLD WHAT'S HERS IS HIS 
GIVE THEM BACK 
OUT OF ALL THE CLOTHES IT'S ALWAYS THE UNDERWEAR HE GOES FOR 
STOP IT STOP IT 
IT'S REALLY BAD AND EMBARRASSING I DON'T KNOW WHY HE GOES FOR IT 
IT'S NOT JUST MINE IT'S ANYBODY'S 
IN HER DESPERATION SAM SECRETLY HARBOURS A MORBID FANTASY 
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO HIM 
BUT SOMETIMES YOU THINK WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER IF HE GOT RUN OVER 
FOR BUDDY IT'S TIME TO SWAP HOME COMFORTS FOR BORSTAL LIFE 
IT'S REALLY LIKE A PRISON 
ALL RIGHT BOY IT'S ALL RIGHT CHEER UP 
ATTEMPTING TO REFORM HIM IS TRAINER ROBERT ALLEYNE 
AN EXPERIENCED BEHAVIOURIST WHO CAN READ A DOG'S MIND LIKE A BOOK 
SAM HI 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY BUDDY YES 
O. K. 
STRAIGHT THROUGH PLEASE COME ON BOY 
IN BORSTAL OWNERS MUST LIVE APART FROM THEIR DOGS 
SAY YOUR GOODBYES DON'T MAKE THEM TOO LONG COS THAT STRESSES THE DOG 
TRY NOT TO STOP AND HAVE BACKWARD GLANCES BECAUSE IT'S EVEN MORE STRESSFUL FOR THE DOG 
I DIDN'T FEEL AT ALL BAD ABOUT LEAVING HIM IN THE KENNEL 
IT'S REVENGE FOR THE TREATMENT HE'S CAUSED ME 
I KNOW I'M DIFFERENT TO EVERYONE ELSE BUT IF YOU KNEW BUDDY YOU'D UNDERSTAND 
IT'S FREEDOM 
BUY ME DIAMONDS AND RUBIES I'M CRAZY ABOUT BENTLEYS 
GUCCI DRESSES AND DROP TOP KOMPRESSORS 
WINE ME AND DINE ME BRING THOSE PLATINUM RINGS 
THOSE ARE A FEW OF OUR FAVOURITE THINGS 
THIS IS RUFF AND TUMBLE TWO PAMPERED CHIHUAHUAS ON THEIR WAY TO THE PARK 
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED SMALL DOGS 
AND I JUST THOUGHT THEY'D BE LIKE NORMAL ORDINARY DOGS 
YOU KNOW THEY'D BE ABLE TO SIT WITH YOU WHEN YOU HAVE COFFEE 
WHEN YOU'RE OUT PEOPLE COME UP AND STROKE THEM AND THINK THEY'RE LOVELY 
IT'S A LIFESTYLE THAT OWNER XAVIER AND PARTNER GARY ASPIRE TO 
BUT RUFF AND TUMBLE DON'T SHARE THE SAME DREAM 
I'VE GOT ONE THAT'S REALLY NICE AND ONE ON AN ASBO AREN'T YOU 
RUFFY 
HE LIKES TO SNAP AT PEOPLE 
UM WHAT ELSE DO YOU DO YOU RUN AND BARK AT PEOPLE 
YOU'RE JUST MAD AREN'T YOU 
AND RUFF HAS A HIT LIST OF PEOPLE HE'S OUT TO GET 
HE DOESN'T LIKE CHILDREN 
HE HATES JOGGERS 
RUFFY 
ORIENTAL WOMEN FOR SOME REASON PEOPLE WITH HATS ON 
BUT IF THERE'S ONE THING RUFF REALLY HATES IT'S A DOG THAT'S BIGGER THAN HE IS 
AND UNFORTUNATELY TODAY THERE'S A DOG PARTY 
IF HE AVOIDS ALL THAT I'LL BE ABSOLUTELY AMAZED 
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF 
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF 
STOP 
HEY SSSH 
NOT SATISFIED WITH GATE CRASHING THE PARTY 
RUFF DECIDES TO PICK A FIGHT WITH THE BOUNCERS 
RUFF HEY 
DOGS YAP 
COME HERE 
THE PARTY IS RUINED 
HEY HEY 
OW OW 
COME HERE COME HERE 
HE GOT BIT 
SSSH SSSH 
EXHAUSTED I WANT TO GO HOME 
STRESSED OUT 
FOR RUFF AND TUMBLE DOG BORSTAL ISN'T GOING TO BE A WALK IN THE PARK 
THEY'RE ABOUT TO MEET LYNNE DAVIES 
A FEARLESS DOG TRAINER WHO CAN TURN THE MOST ANTISOCIAL DELINQUENTS INTO PUSSYCATS 
XAVIER HI HI I'M LYNNE 
I'M GONNA BE YOUR TRAINER FOR THIS WEEK DOG IN 
RIGHT WE'RE GONNA GET ON LIKE A HOUSE ON FIRE 
IN YOUR BED RUFFY IN YOUR BED GO ON GO ON 
BACK STAY 
ARGH DOGGER 
THAT'S GREAT XAVIER 
FOR BUDDY RUFF AND TUMBLE 
THE WEEK AHEAD ISN'T GOING TO BE A HOLIDAY 
BUDDY STANDS ACCUSED OF BEATING UP HIS OWNER SAM 
THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT CASE I'VE HAD 
AND RUFF AND TUMBLE ARE SERVING TIME FOR MOUNTING A CAMPAIGN OF TERROR 
IT'S NO GOOD SAYING THE GUY NEEDS CONTROL OF HIS DOGS YOU NEED TO HAVE CONTROL OF YOUR DOGS 
WHICH OF THESE DOGS WILL EARN THEIR FREEDOM 
IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF TRAINING AND NO ONE'S SLEPT VERY WELL 
OVER AT THE KENNEL BLOCK TRAINER ROBERT GOES TO COLLECT BUDDY FOR HIS FIRST TRAINING SESSION 
TAKE HIM OFF THAT WAY 
ROBERT BELIEVES PLAYING TOGETHER IS KEY TO A GOOD RELATIONSHIP 
GO ON THEN GOOD BOY 
SOON AS HE PICKS IT UP CALL HIM BACK STRAIGHT AWAY 
COME ON BOY BUDDY 
GOOD BOY COME HERE COME ON BOY 
WHAT I'VE GOT TO WORK IN HERE IS THE WAY SAM INTERACTS WITH BUDDY 
COS SHE'S NOT EXCITING AND ANIMATED ENOUGH AND WHEN SHE TALKS TO HIM 
SHE ASKS HIM IF HE'D MIND IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE 
BUDDY WOULD YOU COME AND HE SAYS IT USUALLY IS TOO MUCH TROUBLE 
COME ON BOY BUDDY GOOD BOY COME HERE 
I'VE HAD CASES IN THE PAST WHERE THE OWNER AND DOG WEREN'T NECESSARILY WELL CONNECTED 
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST WHERE THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED 
BUT NEITHER SEEMS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT INTERESTED IN BEING CONNECTED ANYWAY 
THEY'RE LIKE I COULD JUST GO AND FIND SOMEBODY ELSE 
AND BUDDY IS GOING I WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU DID 
SO FOR ME THIS IS A TOUGH ONE AND I HAVE TO BE HONEST AND SAY I'M NOT OPTIMISTICALLY GOING TO GET THERE 
OVER AT H. Q. LYNNE WANTS TO REVIEW RUFF'S ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR 
THAT'S THAT DOG THAT BIT HIM 
THAT DOG A ROTTY 
LOOK AT THIS THE GUY'S GOT TWO OF THEM 
LOOK 
WHERE IS HE HE'S NOT EVEN THERE CONTROLLING THEM 
AND HE BIT HIM 
BUT LYNNE HAS NO SYMPATHY 
THAT WAS CAUSED BY YOUR DOG AND IT'S NO GOOD SAYING THE GUY NEEDS CONTROL OF HIS DOGS 
YOU NEED TO CONTROL YOUR DOGS YOUR DOG STARTED IT WENT OVER THERE 
OUT OF CONTROL IT STARTED AS A GAME YOUR DOG PUSHED IT TOO FAR 
THE ROTTWEILER SAID I'M NOT HAVING THAT THE FACT YOUR DOG'S SMALL 
YOUR DOG GETS HURT YOU'RE OVER PROTECTIVE OF YOUR DOG JUST THE SAME AS THE ROTTWEILER OWNER 
I WANT YOU TO REALISE HOW IMPORTANT AND HOW VITAL IT IS THAT THIS IS DEALT WITH 
YOU COULD BE PROSECUTED UNDER THE DANGEROUS DOGS ACT 
O. I. COME HERE 
LYNNE SENDS XAVIER TO COLLECT HIS DOGS 
DOG OUT 
WALK THEM HOW YOU'D NORMALLY WALK THEM O. K. O. K. 
THE IDEA IS I WANT TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING HOW THEY'RE DOING IT 
RUFF SEEMS TO BE BEHAVING HIMSELF 
HE IS BEING VERY DIFFERENT TO USUAL 
BUT LYNNE ISN'T FOOLED SHE'S ABOUT TO DELIVER SOME DEVASTATING NEWS 
FOR A DOTING LAPDOG OWNER 
I WANT YOU TO TRY FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK 
NOT TO PICK EITHER DOG UP 
WHAT ABOUT A CUDDLE GET ON THE FLOOR AND GIVE THEM A CUDDLE 
LYNNE IS WORRIED ABOUT XAVIER'S POSITION WITHIN THE PACK 
RUFF WANTS TO ELEVATE HIS STATUS 
JUST PUTTING HIS PAW ON YOUR KNEE HE'S PROMOTING HIMSELF TO A DOMINANT POSITION 
WHAT IS THE HIGHEST POINT IN YOUR KINGDOM AT HOME 
MY HEAD HE SITS ON MY HEAD OF COURSE HE DOES 
OR GOES ON THE BACK OF THE SOFA COURSE IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE 
AS FAR AS HE'S CONCERNED HE'S TOP DOG ON YOUR SHOULDERS OVERLOOKING EVERYTHING 
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HE'S CONFUSED 
WITH LYNNE ON THE CASE RUFF'S DAYS AS PACK LEADER ARE NUMBERED 
LYNNE ISN'T HAPPY ABOUT THE NOISE LEVELS IN THE KENNEL BLOCK 
IT'S TIME TO REVEAL HER SECRET WEAPON THE WATER BOTTLE 
YOU ARE GONNA HAVE THAT WATER BOTTLE WITH YOU CONSTANTLY NOW 
YOU'RE COMING AWAY FROM THE KENNEL 
ONE STARTS OR BOTH START I WANT YOU TO WALK STRAIGHT BACK TO THE KENNEL 
GO NO AND CHUCK THE WATER THEN WALK AWAY AGAIN 
IF YOU DO THAT CONSISTENTLY THE DOGS WILL STOP BARKING IN THE KENNEL 
COMING IN NO 
COMING OUT 
OH COMING IN NO 
NO 
COMING OUT AGAIN COMING IN 
NO 
NO 
NO NO 
NO 
COMPLETE PEACE AND QUIET 
EITHER THEY'VE LEARNED THAT WATER MEANS NO 
OR THEY'VE DROWNED 
BAD DOGS BUDDY RUFF AND TUMBLE ARE SERVING TIME AT BORSTAL 
NO IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY MUST SIT A TEST TO PROVE THEY'RE REFORMED 
BUT WILL ANY OF THEM PASS 
ROBERT HAS SUMMONED BUDDY'S OWNER SAM TO HIS OFFICE 
COME IN 
WHEN WE'RE OUT TRAINING THERE IS SOMETHING I FEEL 
THAT'S GETTING IN THE WAY 
I THINK TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I HONESTLY THINK HE 
I'M NOT THE RIGHT OWNER FOR BUDDY 
AND I THINK I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT 
I THINK HE NEEDS SOMEBODY PROBABLY MALE YOUNGER 
SORT OF THING HE JUST SEEMS TO BE LIKE A BLOKE'S DOG 
CLEARLY THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP PROBLEM BETWEEN YOU 
THE REALITY IS YOU HAVE BUDDY AND I HAVE MY DOG 
AND WE MAKE THE BEST OF IT THAT WE CAN 
WHICH IS WHAT EVERYBODY DOES 
I WANT YOU TO STOP THINKING OF YOURSELF AS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR BUDDY 
SO FROM THIS MOMENT ON YOU ARE THE RIGHT OWNER FOR BUDDY 
RIGHT YOU ARE GOING TO PROVIDE ALL THE THINGS BUDDY NEEDS YES 
YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING BUDDY WANTS YOU TO DO 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO BELIEVE IT 
ROBERT LEAVES SAM TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HE'S SAID 
MEANWHILE LYNNE HAS A SURPRISE FOR RUFF 
JUST THREE DAYS AGO 
THE SIGHT OF ANOTHER DOG WOULD SEND HIM BARKING MAD 
RUFF RUFF O. I. 
IT'S TIME TO CONFRONT HIS DEMONS 
O. K. SO I'M NOT PUTTING ON TOO MUCH PRESSURE AT THE MOMENT 
HE'S MORE INTERESTED IN 
HE'S SEEN HER BUT NOT INTERESTED 
OH YEAH 
NO 
RUFF'S RESOLVE FINALLY CRUMBLES 
CLOSE CLOSE 
LYNNE PRESSES ON 
READY YEP 
GOOD LAD FETCH IT GOOD BOY

YEAH JUST I DUNNO REALLY 
IT JUST REALLY HIT 
I FEEL LIKE A PRAT NOW 
OUTSIDE 
AT HOME OBEDIENCE IS NOT ONE OF BUDDY'S STRONG POINTS 
OUTSIDE 
COME ON BOY 
FOR OWNER SAM IT'S TIME TO STOP ASKING 
AND START TELLING HIM WHAT TO DO 
WHEN YOU'RE NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT HE'S DOING 
RATHER THAN GENTLY GUIDING HIM BACK SAYING I'D LIKE YOU TO BE HERE 
HE SAYS BUT I DON'T WANNA DO THAT 
AS SOON AS YOU MOVE OFF HE JUST DOES THAT AGAIN 
I WANT YOU TO TELL HIM YOU'RE NOT HAPPY 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT BUDDY IT'S YOU AND ME NOW 
WHEN I TELL YOU TO GET BACK HERE YOU'LL GET BACK HERE 
DO I YANK HIM BACK I WANT YOU TO YANK HIM BACK 
MAKE IT UNPLEASANT ENOUGH THAT HE THINKS I DON'T LIKE THAT 
MAYBE I WON'T DO THAT AGAIN 
COME ON BUDDY BUDDY 
UNKNOWN TO SAM THERE'S A DEAD RABBIT BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
BUDDY WILL HAVE ALREADY PICKED UP ITS SCENT 
AND BEING A BEAGLE CROSS 
WON'T BE ABLE TO RESIST PULLING IN ITS DIRECTION 
GOOD BOY THIS WAY BUDDY 
THIS WAY BOY O. K. I CAN SEE THAT LEAD'S TAUT NOTHING'S HAPPENING 
EVERY TIME HE HITS THE END OF THAT LEAD YOU HIT HIM BACK 
O. K. COS WHEN HE HITS THE END OF THAT LEAD HE SAID SOD YOU 
I'M PULLING AND I NEED YOU TO SAY SOD YOU YOU'RE NOT RIGHT 
O. K. 
COME BUDDY 
THERE HE'S PULLING NOW 
AND HE'S PULLING THERE 
THAT'S IT 
GOOD BOY SHE'S JUST STARTING NOW TO TELL HIM THAT SHE MEANS IT 
RATHER THAN ASKING HIM 
BUT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S NATURAL FOR SAM 
AND BUDDY KNOWS IT SO IF SHE GIVES HIM AN INCH HE TAKES IT 
GOOD BOY UH 
NO HE WASN'T A GOOD BOY COS THAT WAS TIGHT THEN HE WAS A BAD BOY 
IT'S GETTING THE TIMING RIGHT TIMING IS EVERYTHING 
IF YOU LEAVE HIM FOR TWO SECONDS YOU SAY TWO SECONDS PULLING IS O. K. 
HE CAN'T PULL YOU AT ALL O. K. 
SO HAVE ANOTHER GO 
IT'S BETTER THOUGH COME ON BUDDY 
UH 
MIND THE DEAD RABBIT THAT'S A REAL DISTRACTION 
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT COS I WAS WATCHING HIM I WOULD'VE WALKED INTO IT 
GOOD BOY BUDDY THIS IS MUCH BETTER SAM GOOD 
A MILLION TIMES BETTER GOOD BOY 
IT'S TIME FOR THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE 
BUDDY MUST STAND NEXT TO THE RABBIT WITHOUT HIS HEAD GOING DOWN 
LEAVE STAND HIM CLOSE ENOUGH THAT HE COULD GRAB IT 
IT'S UP TO YOU TO CONTROL HIM LEAVE 
KEEP THE HEAD OFF THE FLOOR LEAVE LEAVE 
O. K. HE'S TRYING TO AVOID IT THAT'S FINE 
DON'T FORCE HIM TO INTERACT WITH IT 
HE SAYS I'LL PUT MYSELF OUT THE WAY 
THAT'S FINE WHAT I WANT IS HIS NOSE NOT ON THE FLOOR 
NOT IN IT OR AROUND IT HE'S GOT TO LEAVE IT ALONE 
O. K. WHAT I'LL GET YOU TO DO NOW IS WALK STRAIGHT PAST IT 
DIRECTLY TOWARDS ME FROM WHERE YOU ARE NOW 
O. K. WHEN YOU'RE READY OFF YOU GO 
LEAVE LEAVE 
LOOK HE JUMPS OVER IT YEAH

HE IS A NORMAL DOG 
I THINK SHE'S GONE FROM FEELING REALLY NEGATIVE THIS MORNING 
TO PROBABLY NOW FEELING PRETTY POSITIVE 
AND I'VE GONE FROM FEELING REALLY NEGATIVE THIS MORNING 
TO FEELING A LITTLE LESS NEGATIVE 
IT'S JUDGMENT DAY FOR THE DOGS AND THEIR OWNERS 
IN UNDER AN HOUR THEY FACE THE FINAL TEST 
AND FOR BUDDY'S OWNER SAM 
THERE'S SOME UNEXPECTED NEWS 
DID YOU GIVE HIM THE NAME BUDDY NO HE CAME WITH IT 
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT LIKE TO THINK ABOUT WOULD BE CHANGING BUDDY'S NAME 
I THINK HE HAS A LOT OF NEGATIVE ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE NAME BUDDY 
IN A LOT OF WAYS WHEN HE HEARS BUDDY 
BUDDY MEANS TO HIM WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING DO IT QUICKER 
BECAUSE SHE'S GONNA SPOIL YOUR FUN IN A MINUTE RIGHT 
FROM THIS POINT ON THE TRAINERS ARE POWERLESS TO INTERVENE 
WILL THEIR DOGS BE SENT HOME IN SHAME 
EVEN FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE TURNED UP TO FIND OUT 
THERE YOU GO BOYS WHO'S THAT IT'S DADDA 
DADDA NUMBER TWO 
THE TEST WILL BE JUDGED BY RYAN O'MEARA

SO HE COULD STEAL THEM AND WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING TO SEE IF BUDDY DOES GO FOR ANYTHING
