WHOA A A A 
AGH AGH 
WE E. E. EE 
AH 
BECKY IS EIGHT YEARS OLD WHAT HAS SHE GOT IN COMMON WITH THIS PLACE 
THEY ACTUALLY BOTH SPEND A LOT OF TIME DOING THE SAME THING 
BECKY IS A KEEN RECYCLER 
AND THIS IS THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED RECYCLING FACTORY FOR DRY WASTE IN EUROPE 
TODAY THEY'LL BOTH BE PUT TO THE TEST 
WE'VE PREPARED TWO IDENTICAL BIN BAGS OF RUBBISH TO SORT 
WHO WILL FINISH SORTING THEIR BAG FIRST 
BECKY OR THE RECYCLING FACTORY 
O. K. ON YOUR MARKS 
GET SET GO 
BECKY'S HAVING A BAD START SHE'S STRUGGLING TO OPEN THE BAG 
AT THE FACTORY THIS MACHINE RACES AHEAD 
EASILY TEARING APART THE BIN BAG WITH ITS METAL TEETH 
LOOKS LIKE BECKY'S MAKING PROGRESS AT LAST SORTING OUT THE PAPER 
SHE MAKES IT LOOK SO SIMPLE 
LOTS OF DIFFERENT ITEMS BUT BECKY KNOWS THEY'RE ALL MADE OF PAPER 
BACK AT THE FACTORY THIS REVOLVING DRUM'S ALSO BUSY SEPARATING THE PAPER FROM THE CONTAINERS 
SMALL CONTAINERS FALL THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES 
WHEREAS FLAT SHEETS OF PAPER FLY THROUGH THE BIGGER HOLES 
BECKY'S MOVED ON TO CONTAINERS NOW 
SHE NEEDS TO LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE MADE OF 
GLASS 
GLASS IS HEAVY 
LIGHT SQUASHY IT'S PLASTIC 
IT'S SHINY AND GOLD IT'S METAL 
SO HOW DOES THE FACTORY DO THE SAME JOB 
USING AN ENORMOUS REVOLVING MAGNET AS SOON AS SOMETHING MADE OF MAGNETIC METAL COMES NEAR 
IT'S ATTRACTED BY THE MAGNET AND SEPARATED FROM THE REST 
AND NOW ONTO PLASTIC AND GLASS IN THIS CRUSHING MACHINE 
THE GLASS SHATTERS BUT PLASTIC JUST GETS SQUASHED LOOK 
FLATTENED PLASTIC BOTTLES COME OUT ON ONE SIDE 
AND BITS OF BROKEN GLASS ON THE OTHER 
BUT LOOK CLOSELY 
THERE ARE STILL BITS OF PLASTIC IN THERE 
AND WHAT ABOUT BECKY 
AFTER ONLY TEN MINUTES NEAT TIDY PERFECTLY SORTED 
GOOD JOB BECKY 
HOORAY 
THE MACHINE CAN'T MATCH BECKY'S PERFECTION 
HOWEVER IN THE TIME IT TOOK HER TO SORT ONE BIN BAG 
THE FACTORY CAN SORT FOUR HUNDRED BIN BAGS 
THAT'S SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TONNES OF WASTE A YEAR 
GREAT MYSTERIES OF OUR TIME 
THE THREE LITTLE PIGS 
WE ALL KNOW THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS 
AND THE WICKED WOLF WHO WANTED TO BLOW THEIR HOUSES DOWN 
THE FIRST LITTLE PIG MADE HIS HOUSE OF STRAW 
AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 
I'M GOING TO HUFF AND PUFF 
AND BLOW YOUR HOUSE DOWN 
AND HE DID 
AAAAAH 
BUT WHY DID THE FIRST LITTLE PIG CHOOSE STRAW 
GREAT MYSTERIES OF OUR TIME HAS UNCOVERED SECRET C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE 
WHICH SHOWS JUST WHY THAT FIRST LITTLE PIG CHOSE STRAW 
HE HAD A PILE OF WOOD 
AND A PILE OF BRICKS 
AS WELL AS STRAW 
BEING A CLEVER LITTLE PIG 
HE DECIDED TO CARRY OUT A FAIR TEST 
TO FIND OUT WHICH WOULD BE THE BEST FOR HIS HOUSE 
HE WOULD BUILD A WALL OUT OF EACH MATERIAL 
FIRST HE BUILT A WALL FROM WOOD 
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED 
IT LOOKED GREAT BUT 
OH THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA IT DOESN'T PROTECT ME FROM THE WIND 
NEXT HE TRIED THE BRICKS 
AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED 
IT LOOKED GREAT BUT 
OH THESE BRICKS WERE A BAD IDEA 
SO HE BUILT A WALL OF STRAW 
AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED 
IT LOOKED GREAT AND 
I CAN'T FEEL ANY WIND AT ALL THIS STRAW IS THE BEST 
I'LL BUILD MY HOUSE FROM STRAW 
AND SO HE DID 
AND THE REST AS THEY SAY 
IS HISTORY 
I'M GOING TO HUFF AND PUFF 
AND BLOW YOUR HOUSE DOWN 
AND HE DID AAAAAH 
SO WHY DID THE FIRST LITTLE PIG GET IT SO WRONG 
YOU'VE SEEN THE EVIDENCE 
YOU DECIDE 
THIS HAS BEEN GREAT MYSTERIES OF OUR TIME 
ONE POINT FIVE OH PLEASE 
AH I NEEDED THAT 
I HAVE HAD A LONG JOURNEY 
I LIVED IN THE FAR NORTH A LAND YOU NOW CALL SIBERIA 
IT IS A VERY COLD PLACE 
IT WAS EVEN COLDER WHEN I LIVED THERE ELEVEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO IN THE ICE AGE AH 
AH ALL WARMED UP NICELY NOW 
M. M. M. ANYWAY THE REASON I'M HERE 
IS BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THAT A DISCOVERY I MADE 
WELL A FEW OF US MADE IT TO BE HONEST 
IS STILL IN USE TODAY 
BUT WHAT DID WE INVENT 
I'LL SHOW YOU 
HAH 
Y. NO NO NOT THE DOUGHNUT 
NO THE PLATE HAH BUT I BET WHENEVER YOU USE A PLATE 
OR A CUP OR A SAUCER I BET YOU NEVER THINK 
OOH WELL DONE UGG NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T 
WELL I'M HERE TO TELL YOU 
THAT PLATES AND CUPS 
WERE NOT ALWAYS AROUND 
H. M. M. 
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED ALL THOSE YEARS AGO 
NOW I WAS STARTING TO GET VERY GOOD AT USING MY HANDS 
I'D MADE CLOTHING OUT OF ANIMAL SKINS 
AND I'D MESSED AROUND WITH THE SOFT STUFF IN THE GROUND 
CLAY 
I MADE MODELS H. M. M. 
LOOK IT'S MUMMY AH HELLO MUMMY 
YES NOW I FOUND OUT 
THAT IF I LEFT MUMMY OUT IN THE SUN TO DRY 
SHE WOULD HOLD HER SHAPE 
BUT THE TROUBLE WAS 
SHE WOULD BREAK VERY EASILY 
AND IF I LEFT HER OUT IN THE RAIN 
SHE WOULD GO ALL SOGGY 
YOU SEE OH MUMMY 
MUMMY YOU'VE GONE ALL SOGGY OH DEAR OH 
ANYWAY 
THEN I MADE MY DISCOVERY 
NOW WE USED TO BUILD FIRES 
ON THE GROUND 
TO KEEP US WARM OF COURSE 
BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE DISCOVERED 
THAT COOKED FOOD TASTED MUCH NICER 
ANYWAY WHEN THE FIRE HAD DIED DOWN 
I NOTICED THAT THE CLAY GROUND AROUND IT HAD GONE VERY HARD 
AND WHAT'S MORE 
THE CLAY DIDN'T BREAK AS EASILY 
AND IT DIDN'T GO ALL SOGGY WHEN IT RAINED 
AND SO I THOUGHT IF ONCE IT'S HEATED CLAY GETS STRONGER 
MAYBE I COULD USE IT TO MAKE SOMETHING MORE USEFUL THAN MUMMY 
LIKE POTS NEWS OF MY DISCOVERY SPREAD QUICKLY 
AND SOON PEOPLE EVERYWHERE WERE MAKING POTS 
POTS OF POTS RIGHT UP TO THE PRESENT DAY 
WHERE NOW POTTERY IS SO COMMON NOBODY EVEN THINKS ABOUT WHERE IT FIRST CAME FROM 
BUT NOW YOU KNOW 
AND SO NEXT TIME YOU HAVE A DRINK 
YOU CAN SAY TO YOUR FRIENDS 
MEN FROM THE STONE AGE WEREN'T MUGS YOU KNOW 
AAH
