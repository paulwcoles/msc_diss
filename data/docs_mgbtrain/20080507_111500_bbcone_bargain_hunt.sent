AND GOING WALKIES WITH THE REDS IS MICHAEL HOGBEN 
YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION THE EARLY BIRD CATCHES THE WORM 
LOOK AT THIS LOT THERE'S NOBODY HERE 
THE FAIR'S OPENING UP THIS IS THE TIME TO GO BARGAIN HUNTING 
WE'VE COME TO BEAUTIFUL WALES AND THE ROYAL WELSH SHOWGROUND IN BUILTH WELLS 
WE'VE GOT A TEAM OF DOG LOVERS AGAINST A TEAM OF POLICE OFFICERS 
YOU KNOW THE SHOW IT'S ALL ABOUT BUYING AT A FAIR 
AND SELLING FOR A PROFIT AT AUCTION 
WILL THE TEAMS MAKE A PROFIT OR JUST GET A CUSTODIAL SENTENCE 
WILL THE EXPERT HELP THEM WITH THE BONUS BUY OR FINISH UP BARKING 
LET'S FIND OUT SHALL WE 
GIVE A BIG WELCOME TO THE RED TEAM MARTINE AND NIGEL AND LEANNE AND DARREN FOR THE BLUES 
WELCOME TO BARGAIN HUNT TEAMS NOW MARTINE YOU'RE INTO DOGS I BELIEVE I AM 
ANY OLD SORT OF DOG NO SALUKIS 
PEDIGREE DOGS WHAT'S A SALUKI WHEN IT'S HOME 
IT'S A DESERT DOG PRIMARILY FROM THE SAHARA DESERT 
THEY'RE THE FASTEST DOGS 
THEY'VE BEEN CLOCKED AT RUNNING AT FIFTY FIVE M. P. H. ARE THEY BIG THEN QUITE BIG 
TWENTY SEVEN INCHES AT THE SHOULDER FOR A MALE DOG THAT'S THE KENNEL CLUB'S STANDARD LIMITING THE HEIGHT 
HOW MANY HAVE YOU GOT TWO A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER 
YOU'RE A BIT OF A CRUFTS GIRL 
YES THE OLDEST GIRL SHE'S QUALIFIED FOR CRUFTS FOR LIFE SO I DON'T HAVE TO 
TRY AND QUALIFY HER EVERY YEAR AND HER DAUGHTER WHO'S TEN MONTHS OLD 
SHE WENT TO CRUFTS THIS YEAR AND SHE GOT A FIRST IN HER CLASS 
WILL YOU BE AFTER DOGGY ANTIQUES TODAY THEN 
HOPEFULLY YES IF I'M ALLOWED 
WHY NIGEL ARE YOU PRETTY CONTROLLING LIKE THAT ARE YOU 
NO NO IF I HAD MY WAY I'D BE LOOKING FOR FOUNTAIN PENS 
IS THAT WHAT YOU COLLECT 
WHY I'M WRITING FIRST DRAFTS OF STORIES SO I USE A LOT OF THEM SO YOU'RE AN AUTHOR ARE YOU 
I AM YES JUST TRYING TO GET A BOOK PUBLISHED IN AMERICA THROUGH AN AGENT AT THE MOMENT 
VERY SLOW MOVING SO HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING YET 
WHAT SORT OF BOOKS DO YOU WRITE 
THINK OF TERRY PRATCHETT THAT KIND OF THING 
BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR FULL TIME JOB 
NO I'M A PSYCHIATRIC NURSE IN A ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH UNIT 
HOW DID YOU TWO MEET 
WE WORKED TOGETHER WE WERE BOTH STUDENTS TOGETHER 
ON THE PSYCHIATRIC WARD SO WHAT DID YOU DO OFFER TO TAKE HER OUT FOR A QUICK BEDPAN OR SOMETHING 
ALMOST PERHAPS WE'D BETTER NOT GO THERE 
I TELL YOU FOUNTAIN PENS AND DOGS 
TWO VERY GOOD THEMES TO BE BUYING FOR BARGAIN HUNT TODAY 
NOW THE BLUE TEAM APPROPRIATELY IN BLUE YOU'RE BOTH POLICE OFFICERS 
DARREN WHAT'S YOUR ROLE IN THE POLICE FORCE 
I'M A LOCAL COMMUNITY WARD OFFICER 
I LOOK AFTER THE LOCAL COMMUNITY ISSUES LIKE ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR AND NEIGHBOUR DISPUTES 
I'VE BEEN IN THE POLICE FORCE FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS NOW 
AND WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT IT 
IT'S DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT EVERY DAY 
YOU'VE NEVER GOT THE SAME THING EVERY DAY SO THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THERE 
RUMOUR TELLS ME YOU'RE A BIT OF A SINGER 
WELL I DID HAVE AN AUDITION WITH THE WELSH NATIONAL OPERA WHEN I WAS ABOUT TWELVE BUT UNFORTUNATELY 
I'M STILL IN THE POLICE DIDN'T GET ANYWHERE WITH IT DID YOUR VOICE BREAK 
YES IT ALL WENT TO POT YOU'VE GOT AN INTEREST IN THE SUPERNATURAL 
IT'S OUR HOUSE WE THINK WE'VE GOT A FEW LITTLE GHOSTIES THERE WE GET THE DOORS OPENING ON THEIR OWN 
YOU CAN HEAR THE LATCH GO AND THE DOOR WILL OPEN OR THE TAP WILL TURN ITSELF ON THAT'S SCARY 
ORNAMENTS WILL MOVE AROUND THINGS WILL DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR THEY'RE QUITE FRIENDLY 
FRIENDLY YES LOTS OF THINGS COME BACK 
SO LEANNE WHAT DO YOU DO IN THE POLICE FORCE I'VE GOT THE SAME ROLE AS DARREN 
DEALING WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND ANY COMMUNITY ISSUES THAT ARISE 
YOU'RE SUCH A PETITE PERSON I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE 
A POLICE OFFICER COS ONE THINKS OF POLICE OFFICERS AS GREAT BIG PEOPLE 
IS IT DIFFICULT BEING OF SMALLER STATURE 
SMALL STATURE BIG MOUTH 
AH YES IS THAT TRUE IT IS VERY TRUE 
YOU'VE GOT A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES WHY IS THAT 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT ALL STARTED FROM BUT EVER SINCE I WAS SMALL 
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED GLENN MILLER AND ALL THE CLOTHES AND THE SHOES 
AND YOU COLLECT THAT STUFF NOT AS SUCH 
I'VE GOT A NINETEEN FORTIES SWIMSUIT WHICH DID FIT ME UP TO ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO 
AND I TRIED IT ON A FEW WEEKS AGO AND IT DOESN'T FIT 
YES THERE'S A NICE THOUGHT GOOD WILL YOU BE LOOKING FOR NINETEEN FORTIES COLLECTIBLES TODAY IF I CAN YES 
WHAT SORT OF THINGS WILL YOU GO FOR 
SOME CERAMICS SOME SUZY COOPER MAYBE 
THE OLD COMPACTS ALL THAT KIND OF THING 
STRATTON COMPACT YEAH 
SHE KNOWS ALL THE NAMES THESE TEAMS ARE GOING TO BE GOOD 
GOOD LUCK PATROLLING THE STALLS THANK YOU 
NOW THREE HUNDRED IS THE MONEY MOMENT YOU KNOW THE RULES AND OFF YOU GO 
AND VERY VERY GOOD LUCK SO WHO'S YOUR MONEY ON THEN 
THE COPS OR THE ROBBERS 
ON THE BEAT WITH THE BLUES IS PIPPA DEELEY 
AND GOING WALKIES WITH THE REDS IS MICHAEL HOGBEN 
WILL HE BE ABLE TO KEEP THEM ON A TIGHT LEAD 
SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR TODAY 
DOG ARTS CARVED WOOD 
CARVED WOOD DOG ART SOMETHING PRACTICAL 
LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK 
HIYA HELLO WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND 
I'VE FOUND MYSELF A MAN YOU HAVE YES A LITTLE MAN 
RATHER CHARMING MAN 
A LITTLE FISHERMAN 
HE'S NICE HAVE YOU LOOK AT THE BASE FOUND A MARK WE HAVE 
WE'VE FOUND A MARK BUT WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IT IS 
I THINK IT'S BING AND GRONDAHL 
HAVE YOU HEARD OF ROYAL COPENHAGEN YES 
THEY DO NATURALISTIC PASTEL COLOURED ANIMALS AND FIGURES AND THINGS AND BING AND GRONDAHL'S 
TOOK THAT OVER SO THEY'RE SORT OF PRODUCING THINGS IN THE SEVENTY EIGHTIES THAT SORT OF DATE I'D PUT HIM AT 
THERE'S A SLIGHT CRACK TO THE GLAZE ON HIS NECK YES THAT'S QUITE A VULNERABLE POINT 
OTHERWISE IT LOOKS QUITE GOOD 
YEAH AND HE'S GOT THESE HOLES THE ONE UNDERNEATH HIS ARM 
THAT'S FOR WHEN THEY FIRE IT 
THIS IS MADE BY HAVING A MOULD THE SLIP'S POURED INTO THE MOULD 
AND IT GOES TO THE EDGES BUT NOT INTO THE CENTRE 
IN THE KILN IF THERE'S NO WAY THE AIR CAN GET OUT HE'LL JUST EXPLODE 
HE'S MARKED UP AT FIFTY FIVE WHAT DO YOU THINK ON THE PRICE FOR THAT ONE 
I THINK THAT'S ABOUT ITS MONEY REALLY AT AUCTION 
WHICH IS ONLY FAIR WHEN YOU THINK THAT WE'RE BUYING AT A FAIR 
WE'VE ALREADY HAD A WORD AND THEY'VE AGREED TO AROUND FORTY 
THAT WOULD BE MORE IN THE RANGE I'D ANTICIPATE MAKING A PROFIT 
NOT VAST AMOUNTS BUT YOU STAND A CHANCE 
IT WAS A GOOD FIND SHALL WE GIVE IT A GO 
GIVE IT A GO AT FORTY GO BACK AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO BRILLIANT WELL DONE O. K. BYE 
THEY PAID FORTY FOR THE FISHERMAN WHAT A CATCH 
I'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE WHICH I THINK MIGHT EXCITE YOUR TASTE BUDS LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
I'M HOPING TO GET YOU EXCITED WITH A NICE VASE OH GOD ANOTHER VASE 
NOT NOT A VASE I MEAN I'VE SEEN YOU BEFORE ON BARGAIN HUNT AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE PRETTY AWFUL 
NOW JUST HANG ON DON'T PRE JUDGE ME SEE I LIKE THAT STRAIGHTAWAY 
REMINDS ME OF A FONDUE SET 
IF BRAINS WERE MADE OF CHOCOLATE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TO FILL A SMARTIE 
THIS IS A LOVELY PIECE OF CHINA 
YOU DON'T SAY THIS IS FANTASTIC I LIKE THE ENAMELLING I DON'T LIKE THIS LOZENGE HERE 
IT'S MADE BY A COMPANY CALLED AMPHORA AND THEY'RE A HUNGARIAN ART NOUVEAU SPECIALIST 
AND THIS IS TYPICAL ART NOUVEAU 
IT'S LIKE A HALF OSTRICH EGG AT THE TOP SUPPORTED BY THESE FOUR SUPPORTS 
YOU'VE GOT ENAMEL DECORATION YOU'VE GOT LUSTRE IN THE TOP 
AND WHEN YOU TURN IT OVER YOU GET THE AMPHORA MARK HERE 
PEOPLE COLLECT AMPHORA 
I MEAN I'VE SEEN AMPHORA IN A SALE MAKE THREE OR FOUR GRAND 
THIS IS NOT THAT SORT OF MONEY BUT IT'S GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT DO YOU LIKE IT 
YEAH I LIKE THE OVERALL DESIGN OF IT AND THE COLOURS YEAH I'D BUY IT 
GOOD IT'S YOURS FOR ONE HUNDRED TEN CHEAP AT HALF THE PRICE 
I'M NOT TOO KEEN ON IT 
BUT SEEING AS YOU LIKE IT BUT I HAVE THE NEXT CHOICE THEN 
YEAH I CAN GO WITH THAT 
WELL LET ME GO AND SEE IF I CAN DO A DEAL ON THIS ONE BECAUSE I THINK I CAN GET IT DOWN EVEN MORE 
I'LL TRY AND GET IT CHEAPER OKEY DOKE THINK YOU CAN LEAVE IT TO ME YEAH GIVE IT A GO 
AND MICHAEL PAID EIGHTY FIVE 
NOT EVERYTHING THAT YOU BUY IN A GENERAL FAIR LIKE THIS 
CAN YOU POSSIBLY EXPECT TO KNOW ABOUT IMMEDIATELY 
YOU HAVE TO DO RESEARCH 
NOW HAVE A LOOK AT THIS 
HERE WE'VE GOT AN OAK PLAQUE COVERED IN BLACK PAINT 
IT'S CALLED EBONISING 
AND ATTACHED TO THIS PLAQUE IS ANOTHER PLAQUE THIS TIME IN CAST BRONZE 
I THINK THE BACKGROUND THIS WOODEN PLATE WAS PROBABLY 
MADE AROUND ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED BUT THE BRONZE PLAQUE IS CONSIDERABLY OLDER 
IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT TELLS A STORY 
IT'S GOT AN EARL'S CORONET AND UNDERNEATH THAT IS A SWAN 
THAT SITS ON A BIT OF MANTLING AND THE WHOLE THING IS CONTAINED BY A FOLIATE WRAPPED FRAME 
THAT'S BECAUSE THAT IS A FAMILY'S ARMS 
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHICH FAMILY'S ARMS IT IS BUT THE VALUE 
WILL DEPEND ON THE RESEARCH THAT I CAN DO TO FIND OUT WHICH FAMILY THIS IS ATTACHED TO 
IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE OUTSIDE THERE ARE SIX HOLES 
AND THOSE HOLES ARE FILLED WITH TWO SCREWS ATTACHING IT TO THE WOODEN PLAQUE 
BUT ORIGINALLY THIS WOULD HAVE GONE ON A VEHICLE OF SOME SORT AND I SUSPECT PROBABLY A RIVER BARGE 
IT'S HEAVY IT'S EXTREMELY GOOD QUALITY AND I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY MADE 
AROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY OR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY 
BUT TO BE CERTAIN I'VE GOT TO DO THE RESEARCH 
NICE THING THOUGH 
ON THE SAME STAND THE DEALER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE'D GOT 
HE SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS THING 
AND OUT HE PRODUCED ANOTHER ARMORIAL DEVICE 
THIS TIME IT'S GOT A GREBE THIS FEATHERED BIRD 
THAT STANDS ON THE TOP OF HAT THAT'S GOT A BIT OF A WAVE ON IT 
THAT TOO WILL RELATE TO AN ANCIENT FAMILY 
HOW DID I PAY WELL YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY TOO MUCH FOR THESE 
BUT IF YOU BELIEVE IN IT IT'S WORTHWHILE HAVING A GO 
I BELIEVE IN THIS GREBE 
I PARTED WITH FIFTEEN FOR IT 
AND THE OTHER PLAQUE I PAID TWENTY FOR 
WERE THEY BARGAINS IF THEY'RE ATTACHED TO A NOBLE FAMILY 
THAT'S GOT SOME HISTORY TO THEM THEY CERTAINLY WILL BE 
THE ANSWER IS RESEARCH 
BLUE TEAM WHERE ARE YOU WHAT HAVE YOU GO THERE 
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS A NICE PRATTWARE MUG 
SEE WHAT YOU THINK IS IT THE SORT OF THING YOU WERE LOOKING FOR 
IT'S QUITE NICE ISN'T IT IT'S NICE YES 
THE AUCTION ROOM HAVE SET US STIPULATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE'VE GOT TO BUY YES 
NO SILVER NO FURNITURE NO PICTURES SO THEY'VE PUT THE EMPHASIS ON CERAMICS AND GLASS 
AND I SPOTTED THIS I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING 
DATES ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY IT'S PRATTWARE 
WHICH IS STONEWARE BASE DECORATED WITH THESE TRANSFER PRINTS 
VERY COLOURFUL ALWAYS INTERESTING SCENES 
IT'S NOT GOT ANY MARKINGS ON IT DO THEY USUALLY 
THEY MADE THEM ON A MASSIVE SCALE SO THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY MARK THEM 
THIS TYPE OF TRANSFER IS EASY TO DO IT'S JUST PRINTING IT ON A WAX PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN PUSHING IT 
ONTO THE BISQUE AND THEN THEY PUT THE CLEAR GLAZE OVER THE TOP 
HE SAYS SIXTY FIVE SO WILL IT MAKE ITS MONEY 
OBVIOUSLY IF WE GET A LITTLE BIT OFF I THINK SIXTY FIVE ISN'T A BAD PRICE 
THAT'S WHY I WAS QUITE SURPRISED BUT I HAD A CHAT WITH THE STALLHOLDER HE SAID FIFTY FIVE 
BUT HE ALSO DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD DAY YESTERDAY SO HE'S LOOKING TO GET RID OF STOCK 
I MIGHT GET HIM DOWN TO FORTY 
WE'D MAKE THE FORTY YOU THINK YEAH DEFINITELY DEFINITELY 
I'M VERY KEEN ON THIS 
SHALL WE GO FOR THAT SEE WHAT WE CAN DO 
I'VE SOLD IT TO YOU THEN O. K. 
I'VE JUST GOT TO GET THE STALLHOLDER TO SELL IT TO ME 
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU IN A SECOND AND I'LL GO AND HAVE A CHAT WITH HIM O. K. BYE 
PIPPA WORKED HER MAGIC AND PICKED IT UP FOR FORTY 
IT'S JUST FANTASTIC OH YOU FOUND SOMETHING ALREADY ANOTHER VASE 
IT'S A POT BUT LOOK AT THAT 
I MEAN THAT IS DOULTON DOULTON PLEASE IT'S WORCESTER OH 
IT IS A QUALITY PIECE IT DOESN'T COME ANY BETTER 
THE LOVELY PART IS THE GILT IS ALL IN GOOD ORDER AND YOU'VE GOT THE FOUR PANELS 
EACH OF THESE ARE HAND PAINTED 
AND WHEN YOU HOLD IT UP TO THE LIGHT IT IS ALMOST LIKE AN EGGSHELL SUCH A FINE PORCELAIN 
AND YOU TURN IT OVER YOU'VE GOT THE PUCE WORCESTER FIFTY ONE MARK THERE 
YOU CAN DATE A PIECE OF WORCESTER BY THESE LITTLE DOTS ON THE BOTTOM 
AND AFTER ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY TWO AROUND THAT WAY EVERY DOT RELATES TO A YEAR 
SO THIS PARTICULAR PIECE ABOUT NINETEEN TWELVE NINETEEN FOURTEEN 
BUT WHEN IT GOES TO THE AUCTION HOPEFULLY THEY'LL WORK OUT WHO PAINTED IT 
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHO PAINTED IT AT THE MOMENT 
HOLD IT AND SEE HOW DELICATE IT IS IT IS WONDERFUL 
IT IS QUALITY IT IS QUALITY 
I KNOW I PROMISED YOU THE NEXT TWO CHOICES BUT THAT IS REALLY REALLY NICE ISN'T IT 
IT IS NO IT'S NOT NICE I CAN SEE THAT IT'S QUITE HOW MUCH IS IT 
THE PRICE WAS A TWO HUNDRED FORTY QUIDDER AND 
I'VE DONE A DEAL MAYBE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY QUID 
AROUND THAT SORT OF PRICE I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO PUT A POSY IN THERE 
I THINK WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT YOU'RE GOING INTO A FINE ART SALE 
IT'S NOT LIKE A GENERAL SALE 
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU'D EXPECT TO FIND IN A FINE ART SALE 
IT'S QUALITY THIS TIME SO SHALL WE GO AND DO A DEAL 
LET'S DO THE DEAL ARE YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'D HAVE IN MY HOUSE 
THE NEXT THING IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE RELATED TO DOGS 
BECAUSE I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU TWO NOW 
THE ROYAL WORCESTER WAS THEIRS FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY 
THE EDWARDIANS REALLY WERE A BRILLIANT LOT WEREN'T THEY 
LOOK AT THIS LUXURY ITEM 
IT'S HALLMARKED IN LONDON IN NINETEEN OH THREE 
IT'S MADE OF SOLID SILVER AND IT LOOKS A BIT LIKE A DOG'S KENNEL OR A HUTCH 
WITH AN ANGLED PITCHED ROOF LIKE THAT 
AND MOUNTED INTO THE ROOF IS THIS LITTLE JOKER 
YOU HAVE A LARGE CIGAR SHOVE IT IN THE END THERE AND JUST NIP THE END OF THE CIGAR USING THAT STEEL BLADE 
READY FOR A NICE SMOKE 
BUT THIS HAS GOT ANOTHER FUNCTION 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FRONT PANEL IT'S HATCHED WITH LINES FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE 
YOU'D HINGE OPEN THE ROOF OF THE HUTCH AND INSIDE THERE YOU'D STORE YOUR VESTA OR MATCH 
SHUT THE LID AND STRIKE IT ON THERE AND IT'D BE READY FOR A NICE SMOKE 
SO IT'S A DUAL CIGAR CUTTER AND VESTA HOLDER BRILLIANT 
BOTH OF WHICH OF COURSE ARE HIGHLY COLLECTIBLE 
I FOUND IT ON THE STALL FOR ONE HUNDRED TEN AND ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S WORTH BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED 
SO THERE'S A PROFIT IN THAT 
HE'S FOUND SOMETHING A LITTLE DESK SET IT'S DIFFERENT 
SWEET ISN'T IT 
THEY DO SAY THAT TREEN IS ON THE LIST OF THINGS WE CAN BUY FOR THE SALE ROOM 
WELL SPOTTED SO WE'VE GOT A PENCIL HERE 
A LITTLE BIT OF DAMAGE THERE PROBABLY COULD BE FIXED BUT JUST SOMETHING TO BEAR IN MIND 
WHAT ABOUT YOURS THIS ONE SEEMS O. K. IT'S JUST BENT IN SLIGHTLY 
BUT AT LEAST YOU COULD FIT ONE ON 
THE INK POT'S FINE NO CHIPS 
AND HAVE YOU CHECKED THE HINGE YES SEEMS FINE 
I THINK IT IS SILVER PLATED I DO NOT THINK IT IS PRECIOUS METAL 
IT IS NOT WOBBLY SO IT SEEMS O. K. GOOD WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THE TOG ON THE TOP THERE IS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THAT IS QUITE PRICEY 
I'VE HAD A WORD I CAN GET IT DOWN TO NINETY CAN YOU 
YEAH BLIMEY DO YOU THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE AT NINETY 
NINETY IS STILL QUITE STEEP BUT SOMETIMES THINGS LIKE THIS 
CAN GO FOR SILLY MONEY BECAUSE IF TWO PEOPLE REALLY LIKE IT 
WHO THINK IT WILL STAND A CHANCE ON THEIR STALL OR JUST PRIVATE BUYERS WHO WANTED FOR THEMSELVES 
IT'S POSSIBLY ONE OF THOSE THINGS TO TAKE A GAMBLE ON O. K. I LIKE IT 
IT CAUGHT YOUR EYE IT MIGHT CATCH OTHER PEOPLES 
HOW OLD DO THINK IT IS 
TWENTIETH CENTURY MAYBE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
YES I THOUGHT ABOUT THIRTIES HOW ABOUT YOU LEANNE 
IT'S DIFFERENT O. K. BEING DIPLOMATIC HERE 
IT'S DIFFERENT I THINK WE WILL GIVE IT A GO AND SEE HOW WE DO 
RIGHT YEAH AND IF WE LOSE IT'S HIS FAULT 
I WILL NEVER FORGET IT O. K. I'LL GO OFF AND DO THE DEAL THEN 
RIGHT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS UH UH 
MARTINE IS STILL SET ON GETTING A DOG 
WHAT ABOUT THIS THEN UH UH 
SO HOW MANY MORE DOGS DO YOU THINK SHE'S GOING TO LOOK AT 
SHE'S ON PLANET FIDO AT THE MOMENT 
IS SHE WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS ONE THEN OH AT LAST 
YOU'VE GOT TO LIKE THIS ONE WHY 
BECAUSE I THINK I'VE GOT THE RIGHT PRICE BECAUSE WE'VE ONLY GOT FIFTY FIVE LEFT 
AND THEY WANT FIFTY FIVE FOR IT BUT SHE'LL LET ME HAVE IT FOR FORTY 
FORTY YES AND I KNOW THAT THE BOOK PRICE IS ABOUT SIXTY FOR IT SO I THINK IT'S QUITE A GOOD BUY 
SO YOU'VE DONE A DEAL I MEAN I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE A HORSE WITH A DOG'S HEAD 
SHE LOOKS A BIT LIKE A TIGER AS WELL AT THE BACK IT'S A BRINDLE BOXER 
I MEAN THE THING ABOUT IT IS IT'S BESWICK IS THE MAKER 
THEY MADE LOADS OF DOG MODELS CATS PIGEONS 
A BOOK PRICE IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY AT AN ANTIQUES FAIR NOT AT AN AUCTION 
THE FACT THAT THIS IS SIXTY IN THE BOOK DOESN'T MEAN YOU'LL GET SIXTY AT AN AUCTION 
MY MAIN CONCERN IS IT'S LATE IT'S EIGHTIES 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT IT'S ABOUT EIGHTY NINE I THINK BUT IT'S QUALITY 
I THINK IT'S O. K. IT'S A NAME IT'S QUALITY IT'S NOT DAMAGED 
IT'S ALL RIGHT IT'S BESWICK IT'S FORTY 
IT LEAVES THIS MAN WITH FIFTEEN AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT HE CAN GET THEN 
I JUST KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MY LIFE DIFFICULT I THINK IT'S O. K. 
HE'S GOT A CUTE FACE YEAH IT'S NOT MY CUP OF TEA 
GO ON GO ON GO ON GO ON I'M HAVING IT GO FOR IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH BYE 
OH WELL SHE'S GOT HER DOG SHE'S HAPPY 
SHE'S ECSTATIC 
THERE WILL BE LEFT OVER LOLLY 
SO THE PRESSURE'S ON PIPPA AND MICHAEL TO FIND THAT BONUS BUY 
BUT WILL THEY PULL IT OUT OF THE HAT 
MARTINE AND NIGEL ARE OFF TO AUCTION 
WITH THE VASE BOUGHT FOR EIGHTY FIVE 
BUT HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE SO HIDEOUS 
FOR A HEFTY ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THEY BOUGHT THE ROYAL WORCESTER VASE 
AND MARTINE GOT HER WISH AND BOUGHT THE BOXER DOG FOR FORTY QUID 
YOU REALLY HATED THAT BOWL DIDN'T YOU MARTINE EH 
IT WAS A BIT TOO HEAVY AND IT LOOKS LIKE A FONDUE BOWL HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE 
O. K. FIFTEEN SMACKERS FOR ME WHICH I WILL PASS OVER TO HOGGERS IT'S NOT A LOT TIMOTHY 
YOU FEELING CHALLENGED 
I MIGHT JUST FIFTEEN IN THE AUCTION AND SEE HOW MUCH IT MAKES

ANYWAY LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE BLUES BOUGHT 
DARREN AND LEANNE TAKE THE PORCELAIN FISHERMAN BOUGHT FOR FORTY 
THE PRATTWARE MUG FROM THE MID NINETEENTH CENTURY ALSO BOUGHT FOR FORTY 
AND NINETY BOUGHT THEM THE TREEN BOAT BUT WILL IT SAIL AWAY AT AUCTION 
THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE WASN'T IT IT WAS 
WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE BIGGEST PROFIT DO YOU RECKON 
THE PRATTWARE MUG DO YOU RECKON YEAH ALL RIGHT HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SPENT 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY I WANT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY BACK THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY INTO PIPPA'S WELCOME GRASP 
THANK YOU WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THAT SPEND IT WISELY GOT ANYTHING IN MIND 
I HAVE AND I'VE ASKED THE STALLHOLDER TO PUT IT TO ONE SIDE YOU'VE RESERVED IT 
ANYWAY I'M OFF TO THE HILLS 
WE'VE COME TO CHIRK CASTLE WHICH IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WAS THE HOME OF SIR THOMAS MIDDLETON 
IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY ONE HE WAS THE RECIPIENT OF A VERY SPECIAL GIFT FROM CHARLES THE SECOND 
AND THIS IS THE GIFT 
FRANKLY AT FIRST GLANCE IT DOESN'T LOOK TERRIBLY SPECTACULAR DOES IT 
DARK IN COLOUR EBONY VENEERS TYPICAL FLEMISH RIPPLE MOULDINGS 
RUNNING ROUND THESE PANELS AND FILLED WITH 
QUITE EXOTIC RED STAINED TORTOISESHELL 
THE FIRST REAL HINT TO WHAT LIES WITHIN IS WITH THESE ESCUTCHEONS 
SEE THEM THOSE GROTESQUE MASKS 
THEY'RE ACTUALLY MADE OF SOLID SILVER BUT THAT AS THEY SAY 
AIN'T NOTHING IN COMPARISON TO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND INSIDE 
ISN'T THAT BRILLIANT 
FRANZ FRANCKEN THE YOUNGER PAINTED THESE PANELS ON COPPER 
AND THEY'VE ALL BEEN FRAMED IN DELICIOUS EMBOSSED SOLID SILVER MOUNTS 
THAT LAYER LOOKS SOLID DOESN'T IT 
LOOKS AS IF IT'S A SERIES OF DRAWERS WELL IT'S NOT 
ACTUALLY IT'S JUST A FLAP THAT LEADS US ON OUR JOURNEY INTO THE CENTRE OF THIS CABINET 
WOW LOOK AT THAT MORE DRAWERS BUT ALL PLASTERED IN SOLID SILVER 
IF I OPEN THE CENTRE PAIR OF DOORS THAT LOOK A BIT LIKE A TABERNACLE 
THERE'S ANOTHER HIDDEN INTERIOR 
AND UNLOCK THIS JOKER WHICH ENCLOSES THE INNER TABERNACLE 
IN WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE YOUR HOLY RELIC SAFELY STORED 
THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER SECRET IN THIS CABINET 
IF I TAKE OUT THIS DRAWER 
WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE IS BEAUTIFULLY LINED IN HARDWOOD 
AND THEN THIS DRAWER YOU SEE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO O. K. 
THERE'S A FURTHER SECRET 
AND THAT IS IT 
THAT STASH OF CASH THAT YOU'D WANT TO KEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR CHARLES THE SECOND CABINET 
BRILLIANT ISN'T IT 
I WONDER IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A STASH OF CASH FOR OUR TEAMS TODAY DOWN AT THE AUCTION 
WE'VE COME ACROSS THE BORDER TO SHREWSBURY TO HALLS AUCTION ROOMS 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER JEREMY LAMOND THINKS OF OUR ITEMS

YEAH HALF A DEAD OCTOPUS I THINK ABSOLUTELY 
WELL IT IS AMPHORA YES 
AND IT IS CALLED A MOORISH ASSORTMENT VASE AND IT IS MADE IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
SO OBVIOUSLY IT COULDN'T HAVE EXISTED BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTEEN SO I THINK IT'S A NINETEEN TWENTIES ONE YES 
IT'S DIFFERENT ISN'T IT 
IT'S HIDEOUS ACTUALLY SIXTY EIGHTY OR SO SIXTY OR EIGHTY 
IT'D BE BETTER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AS YOU SAY YOU COULD HAVE IT IN YOUR AQUARIUM 
SOMETHING FISHY ABOUT IT 
YES ABSOLUTELY ANYWAY THEY PAID EIGHTY FIVE WELL 
NOW THERE'S A SUPREMELY TRADITIONAL PIECE OF WORCESTER ISN'T IT

HOW MUCH 
EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY WHAT HAVE THEY PAID ONE HUNDRED SIXTY MATE WHERE'S THE LID 
WELL NOT WITH IT THERE YOU ARE THEY PAID TOO MUCH DOES IT REALLY HAVE A LID 
IT COULD HAVE HAD 
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE NOW NO SUPER 
WHAT ABOUT OLD BOXER HERE

WE'LL HAVE A THINK ABOUT IT YOU HAVE A THINK ABOUT IT 
LEANNE WILL HAVE A THINK ABOUT IT 
PIPPA WILL HAVE A THINK ABOUT IT 
FOR YOU AT HOME LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT IT 
THIS IS PRETTY GORGEOUS ISN'T IT 
ISN'T IT FABULOUS 
THAT IS THOMAS SARGENT 
A FRENCH CERAMICIST FROM THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTIES WORKING IN THE PALACE IN THE PALISSY STYLE RIGHT 
IT IS WHAT WE WOULD CALL MAJOLICA 
IT'S WORTH TWENTY TO FORTY 
I SUPPOSE IF THE AMERICANS GOT INVOLVED IT COULD BE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED DOLLARS 
BUT THAT WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD DAY 
WE NEED A REALLY GOOD DAY BECAUSE PIPPA PAID FIFTY YOU KNOW 
WELL FINGERS CROSSED NOTHING WRONG WITH IT 
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE CROSSED ARE YOU TAKING THE AUCTION 
I AM AH WE'RE IN SAFE HANDS 
I'M TURNING JAPANESE I THINK I'M TURNING JAPANESE I REALLY THINK SO 
TURNING JAPANESE I THINK I'M TURNING JAPANESE I REALLY THINK SO 
JUST LOOK AT THIS JOKER ACTUALLY THIS IS AN ENORMOUS JAPANESE HANGING AND IT'S ONE OF TWO 
THE ONE UNDERNEATH IS A BIT SHOT IT'S GOT DARN HOLES AND REPAIRS AND SO FORTH 
BUT THE TOP ONE IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT IT TELLS A STORY 
WE'RE OUT IN SOME MYTHICAL LANDSCAPE WITH A WATERFALL CASCADING IN THE TOP CORNER WHICH COMES AND APPEARS 
THROUGH A GORGE FURTHER DOWN WITH THIS LEAPING EXTRAORDINARILY DOG OF FOE IN THE MIDDLE 
WHAT'S NICE ABOUT IT IS IT HAS NO SYMMETRY AT ALL WHICH IS TYPICAL OF JAPANESE WORKS OF ART 
LOOK AT THE WAY IN WHICH THAT PEONY ON THAT SIDE DOESN'T MATCH THE PEONY ON THIS 
WHICH WOULD HAPPEN PROBABLY IF IT WAS CHINESE 
THE STITCHWORK IS EXQUISITE 
HERE IN THE FLOWING MANE ON THIS DOG OF FOE YOU'VE GOT LITTLE RAISED BITS WHICH ARE ALL WORKED UP 
WITH LITTLE BITS OF KAPOK AND THEN BRILLIANT GOLD THREAD 
INTO THE WHOLE DESIGN GIVING IT A SORT OF FLAMING APPEARANCE ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY 
JUST THINK OF THE THOUSANDS OF HOURS IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN TO HAVE WOVEN THIS HANGING 
ALL EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE 
THE OTHER ATTRACTIVE THING ABOUT IT IS THE ESTIMATE TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED
