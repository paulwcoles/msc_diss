I THINK ADS ARE ARCHAEOLOGY THEY'RE THE MIRROR TO THE WAY YOU LIVED 
IT'S FRESH AS ICE IT REPRESENTS A COMIC STRIP OF OUR TIME 
TOOTHPASTE THAT DOES YOUR GUMS GOOD 
SEVERAL TIMES IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THE MOOD HAS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED 
IT TINGLES ADVERTISING IS THE BAROMETER OF AN AGE 
IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW A GENERATION PERCEIVES ITSELF LOOK AT ITS ADS 
IT TELLS YOU SOMETHING IMPORTANT 
WHEN IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE GIBBS S. R. PRESENTED THIS COMMERCIAL IN BRITAIN 
MANY ANTICIPATED THE PERVERSION OF THE NATION'S CULTURE 
COMMERCIAL TELEVISION DID PLAY ITS PART IN A CONSUMER REVOLUTION WHICH TRANSFORMED POST WAR BRITAIN 
BRUSH YOUR TEETH WITH S. R. THE TINGLING FRESH TOOTHPASTE FOR TEETH AND GUMS 
YET FIRST NIGHT ADVERTISING BY COMPANIES LIKE FORD DEFIED EXPECTATIONS 
IF THIS WAS REVOLUTION IT WAS HEAVILY DISGUISED 
INSTEAD OF THE FEARED HARD SELL 
IT RESEMBLED NOTHING MORE STRONGLY THAN A WARTIME PROPAGANDA FILM 
ON THIS HISTORIC NIGHT FORD PAY TRIBUTE TO THE MEN WHO MAKE YOUR FORD CARS TRUCKS AND TRACTORS 
WITH SUCH JEWEL LIKE PRECISION 
SHELL'S ADVERTISING FEATURES DID VERY LITTLE SELLING 
TO DO SO WOULD HAVE SEEMED AMERICAN 
THIS WAS REASSURINGLY BRITISH 
ON MAIN ROADS IN THE COTSWOLDS YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ANY VILLAGES ARE NEAR 
EVEN THE SIGNPOSTS SEEM TO BE TELLING LIES 
EASTLEACH MARTIN LEADS TO MY FAVOURITE COTSWOLD VILLAGE 
I'M NOT TELLING YOU HOW TO GET TO IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE CLEVER ENOUGH TO USE A LARGE SCALE MAP TO FIND IT 
CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT WAS ANYTHING AS VULGAR AS A PETROL STATION 
BETJEMAN LOOKED BACKWARDS OFFERING A NOSTALGIC TOUR OF AN UNCHANGING BRITISH LANDSCAPE 
THE WAY TO LOOK AT A VILLAGE IS TO GET OUT OF YOUR MOTOR CAR AND WALK 
IN THE EARLY FIFTIES WHEN WE STARTED TO MOVE INTO MORE PROSPERITY 
PEOPLE STARTED TO SAY AS PRAISE IT'S JUST LIKE PRE WAR 
FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS YOU FEEL THAT WE'RE GETTING BACK TO WHAT WE'D ENJOYED BEFORE THE WAR 
A SYMBOL OF THIS FORMER SECURITY WAS THE HEARTH 
ADVERTISING FAMILIES GATHERED AROUND THE FIRE REASSURED REAL FAMILIES NOW GATHERED AROUND T. V. 
REASSURING TOO WAS THE ADVERTISERS' CELEBRATION OF CARING NEIGHBOURS 
THE CAMARADERIE OF THE WAR YEARS STILL HELD ITS APPEAL 
MANUFACTURERS WERE SHOWING THEY UNDERSTOOD AND SUPPORTED COMMUNITY LIFE 
YET THE NEWSREEL STYLE OF ADVERTS HARDLY DISTINGUISHED ONE PRODUCT FROM ANOTHER 
ONCE BRITISH ADVERTISING HAD REASSURED IT HAD TO LEARN TO SELL 
FOR THE THIRD TIME DONALD CAMPBELL SMASHED HIS OWN WORLD WATER SPEED RECORD IN THE AMAZING BLUEBIRD 
BRITAIN TOOK PRIDE IN SPORTING ACHIEVEMENTS 
ADVERTISING PURSUED ITS HEROES FOR ENDORSEMENTS DONALD CAMPBELL HAPPILY OBLIGED 
I ALWAYS RELY ON MOBILGAS 
DONALD CAMPBELL DID IT AGAIN ON B. P. FUEL 
WE HOPE BRITAIN WILL BE FIRST TO CARRY THE LAND SPEED RECORD BEYOND FOUR HUNDRED M. P. H. 
THERE'S A MODEL CAMPBELL CAR FREE WITH KELLOGG'S SUGAR FROSTED FLAKES 
NINETY EIGHT OUT ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN HAVE BAD TEETH BY THE TIME THEY'RE TWELVE NOW THIS IS A SHOCKING STATE OF AFFAIRS 
TEN YEARS AFTER THE WAR BRITAIN WAS STILL A VERY DEFERENTIAL SOCIETY 
THEY'D HAD FIVE YEARS OF BEING MILITARISED 
AND NATIONAL SERVICE DIDN'T END TILL NINETEEN SIXTY FOR MEN 
AND WE LIVE IN A VERY CLASS BASED SOCIETY 
WELL THERE WE ARE 
THE SORT OF PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN RUNNING THE COUNTRY IN TWEEDS AND PIPES FOR QUITE A LONG TIME 
HERE THEY ARE 
AS YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE ESTATE CARS 
THE MODEL ON MY LEFT IS THE ESCORT 
THE DELUXE VERSION ON MY RIGHT IS THE SQUIRE 
NAMES LIKE SQUIRE AND OXFORD REINFORCED MOTORING'S ASSOCIATION WITH PRIVILEGE 
TRIMMED IN WOOD AND LEATHER IT WAS AN EXTENSION OF THE COUNTRY HOUSE 
THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE TONES OF THE HOME COUNTIES 
OH HELLO NO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY 
WELL STORK SEEMS TO WIN YES DEAR IT CERTAINLY DOES 
CAN'T RESIST MY WIFE'S SCONES 
THEY'RE JOLLY GOOD 
HERE YOU ARE IT'S REAL BUTTER 
IN DEMONSTRATING RESPECTABILITY WHAT YOU ATE WAS AS IMPORTANT AS HOW YOU SPOKE 
ONLY BUTTER WILL DO 
AFTER WARTIME DEPRIVATION BUTTER WAS PROOF OF SOCIAL STATUS 
MARGARINE FACED A FORMIDABLE CHALLENGE 
IT RECRUITED THE APPROVAL OF RESPECTED PROFESSIONALS 
I LIKE TO FEEL THERE'S GOODNESS IN WHAT I EAT 
YOU HAVE TO BE FIT TO RUN A SCHOOL 
AND I LIKE THINGS TASTY TOO 
WHAT DO YOU PUT ON YOUR TOAST STORK OF COURSE 
WHAT'S ON THE BREAD OFFICER STORK OF COURSE 
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE TYPES OF PEOPLE WE FEATURED IN THAT CAMPAIGN HAD THE KIND OF RELIABILITY 
THAT MADE THE VIEWER FEEL IF THEY RECOMMEND THAT PRODUCT THEN IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR US 
IN THE EARLY SIXTIES STORK'S CHOICE OF PROFESSIONALS CHANGED RADICALLY 
TRADITIONAL PROFESSIONS WERE REPLACED BY MODERN HEROES 
CROP SPRAYING DOESN'T TAKE LONG AT EIGHTY M. P. H. 
A PILOT LIKE ROY PAYNE HAS TO CONCENTRATE 
YES ROY CAN REALLY HANDLE A PLANE BUT HE CAN'T TELL STORK FROM BUTTER 
THIS IS THE LONDON CONTINENTAL EXCHANGE 
THIS IS JULIE CARTER SHE CAN LINK YOU WITH ROME OR ROTTERDAM 
BUT SHE CAN'T TELL STORK FROM BUTTER 
THERE WAS A NEW STATUS GIVEN TO PEOPLE WHO HAD SPECIAL SKILLS LIKE SCIENTISTS OR SURVEYORS 
THESE WERE USED IN COMMERCIALS BECAUSE AS TECHNICIANS OF QUALITY 
THEIR ENDORSEMENT MEANT THEY VIEWED THE PRODUCT AS PART OF THE NEW LIFE WE COULD ALL SHARE 
EAST KILBRIDE 
A GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE 
A BRAND NEW TOWN 
PEOPLE ENJOY LIVING HERE 
THEY ENJOY WALL'S ICE CREAM 
WALL'S WANTED TO ASSOCIATE THEIR PRODUCT 
WITH THE BRAVE NEW WORLD OF ASPIRATION OF PEOPLE GOING TO LIVE IN NEW TOWNS 
TODAY MANY OF THESE TOWNS ARE A SICK JOKE BUT THEY WERE NOT A JOKE THEN 
MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN EAST KILBRIDE HAD COME FROM THE WORST SLUMS IN THE U. K. THE GORBALS 
SO THIS WAS A BRAVE NEW WORLD 
BRITAIN WAS FIRST TO DISCOVER THE NUCLEAR NATURE OF THE ATOM 
THANKS TO LORD RUTHERFORD 
BRITISH MOTORISTS ARE ALWAYS FIRST TO BENEFIT FROM DEVELOPMENTS IN OIL 
ENJOY LIFE AT WORK ENJOY LIFE AT PLAY 
THE PROMISE OF THE LIBERATING POWER OF TECHNOLOGY EMBRACED EVERYTHING FROM NUCLEAR POWER TO FROZEN PEAS 
BEFORE THEY'RE PICKED THEY'RE TESTED FOR TENDERNESS BY A MACHINE WATCH THE SCREEN 
THE NEEDLE WILL SHOW THE EXACT DEGREE OF TENDERNESS 
AS HOMEMAKING WAS SWEPT UP IN CONSUMER CULTURE ADVERTS PROMISED RELEASE FROM THE DAILY GRIND 
I'M GOING TO SEE MY HOTPOINT'S TAKEN CARE OF WE WERE ALL BEING FREED UP 
BIG TUBS LITTLE TUBS 
THAT WAS THE FEELING OF THE TIMES YOU COULD AFFORD YOUR CAR ON H. P. YOU COULD GET INTO YOUR CAR AND GO 
SHE'S GOT A REPUTATION FOR ELEGANCE 
SHE'S GOT RHYTHM THE RENAULT DAUPHINE 
SHE GOES WITH AN EVEN FLOW THAT'S AEROSTABLE SUSPENSION 
NO WONDER SHE GETS THE ATTENTION 
SEVENTY MILES IN AN HOUR SHE'S TOUGH THE RENAULT DAUPHINE 
SHE'S GOT A BUILT IN HEATER SHE'S WARM THE RENAULT DAUPHINE 
ECONOMY EXCITEMENT ELEGANCE AND SHE'S GOT RHYTHM THE RENAULT DAUPHINE 
THE PROMISE OF THE OPEN ROAD EPITOMISED THE CHANGES IN BRITISH SOCIETY 
THE LAKE DISTRICT PART OF BRITAIN'S NATIONAL HERITAGE 
NATIONAL BENZOLE LIKE SHELL HAD MADE ITS EARLIEST ADVERTS ELEGIES TO THE BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE 
BUT THE PASTORAL REASSURANCE OF THE MID FIFTIES APPEARED ANACHRONISTIC BY THE END OF THE DECADE 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE NATIONAL BENZOLE REPLACED IT WITH THE MOST INNOVATIVE CAMPAIGN YET SEEN 
THE GETAWAY PEOPLE 
GETAWAY PEOPLE GET SUPER NATIONAL 
THESE FILMS ARE ABOUT RELEASE 
THEY WERE GETTING AWAY FROM SOMETHING AND GETTING AWAY TO SOMETHING 
THAT RELEASE WAS VERY RELEVANT TO WHAT WE WERE SAYING ABOUT MOTORING 
WITH THE GETAWAY PEOPLE ADVERTISING WAS RELEASED 
INTO AN UNINHIBITED WORLD 
NATIONAL HAD INVENTED A NEW ADVERTISING LANGUAGE 
A NEW GENERATION OF ADVERTISERS FOUND IT IRRESISTIBLE 
I CAME INTO ADVERTISING IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN OUR JOB WAS TO SELL THE PRODUCT 
YOU SHOWED THE PRODUCT WELL THIS SUIT WOULD HAVE BEEN SHOWN LIKE A PIECE OF CARDBOARD 
BE ADVENTUROUS ABOUT THE PRICE 
WHERE YOU COULD BUY IT 
THAT PERTAINED TILL ABOUT SIXTY TWO SIXTY THREE 
THEN WE GOT HOLD OF THE NOTION THAT IT WAS MORE EFFECTIVE TO SELL WHAT THIS SUIT DID FOR YOU 
THAT BECAME THE MESSAGE 
AND IT WENT RIGHT ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF ADVERTISING 
THE MOST INTERESTING CAMPAIGN ALTHOUGH IT WAS A FAILURE WAS THE STRAND CIGARETTE CAMPAIGN 
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME CIGARETTES SOLD MOOD NOT PRICE 
YOU'RE NEVER ALONE WITH A STRAND THE CIGARETTE OF THE MOMENT 
THE PRODUCT HAD A PROMISE IT HAD AN IMAGE AND A UNIVERSE TO IT 
YOU HAD TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT IMAGE WAS YOU COULDN'T INVENT IT 
YOU COULD RELEASE IT BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF THE PRODUCT 
THE NEW CIGARETTE SPECIALLY MADE TO SUIT THE PACE OF TODAY 
THIS CELEBRATION OF TODAY WAS CRUCIAL 
THE MOST DESIRABLE PLACE TO BE WAS THE PRESENT NOT THE PAST THE CITY NOT THE COUNTRYSIDE 
ONE THING THAT MARKED OUT JUST THAT PARTICULAR PERIOD 
SO IMMEDIATE WAS THE SENSE OF THE DREAM MOVING FORWARD 
WAS THE FACT THAT THE DATE ITSELF IT'S VERY SIXTY FOUR 
THE SIXTY FIVE LOOK 
IT'S SIXTY SIX NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AND AIN'T LIFE WONDERLOAF 
THE DATE CONVEYED THE SENSE THAT WE WERE HURTLING FORWARD 
A MODERN BREAD FOR A MODERN WORLD 
QUICK EASY CONVENIENT 
AND GOOD VERY GOOD 
GREAT BREAD GREAT LIFE 
EVEN THE MUNDANE MUST BE MADE EXCITING 
IT'S ALL GOT TO BE WONDERFUL AND NEW 
OR WHY WOULD THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE INNOVATORS INVESTORS IN CHANGE WHY WOULD THEY BOTHER 
SEEN THE NEW BRYLCREEM DISPENSER CLEAN CUT MODERN DESIGN 
FEEL HOW TOUGH AND DURABLE IT IS MADE TO MEASURE JUST THE RIGHT QUANTITY 
IF YOU STILL USE THIS OLD GLASS DISPENSER WE'D LIKE YOU TO CHANGE 
THE GLASS REFILL IS NOT BEING MADE ANY MORE 
IF IT WAS NEW IT WAS GOOD 
IF IT WAS OLD IT WAS BAD IT WAS OUTMODED IT WAS INEFFICIENT 
IT WAS ALL THINGS WHICH THE DREAM WAS LIBERATING US FROM 
IT'S NEW BECAME THE SACRED MANTRA 
NEW JOB NEW CHALLENGE 
NEW WORLD 
BRAND NEW BREATH EVERY TIME YOU BRUSH 
IN THIS NEW WORLD OF SIXTIES ADVERTISING IT ALL LOOKED THE SAME 
NOISE IMAGE SEX AND SPEED 
THE VOCABULARY OF THE YOUTH MARKET WAS LAVISHED ON EVERYTHING 
EVEN TRADITIONAL BRANDS FLEW THE FLAG WITH NEW RULES 
THE UNION JACK HAD TO BE CLEANSED OF ARCHAIC MEANING 
WHO PUT THE TEA IN BRITAIN TY PHOO 
LET'S HAVE THE TEA OF BRITAIN 
TY PHOO PUT THE TEA IN BRITAIN TY PHOO 
A MARS A DAY HELPS YOU WORK REST AND PLAY 
MARS WERE MORE CONSERVATIVE THEY'D ALWAYS SOLD THEMSELVES AS A NATIONAL INSTITUTION 
THEY NOW PAID LIP SERVICE TO THE NEW 
THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD IS PART OF OUR WAY OF LIFE SO ARE MARS BARS 
IT WAS A PARADOXICAL RECIPE NOURISHING BUT EXCITING HISTORIC BUT MODERN 
THE GOOD FOOD VALUE OF A MARS PART OF OUR WAY OF LIFE 
NEW AND EXCITING EVERY DAY MARS 
LONDON WHOSE MELLOWED BRICKS ARE CHERISHED AS MONUMENTS TO CENTURIES OF TRADITION 
NOW ALONGSIDE THE OLD THE NEW LONDON THRUSTS ITSELF INTO THE SKY 
IT'S TYPICAL OF BRITAIN TO PRESERVE THE BEST OF THE OLD WHILST WELCOMING THE BEST OF THE NEW 
WITH CIGARETTES TOO THERE'S A NEW WAY 
THE IDENTIFICATION OF CIGARETTES WITH NEW ARCHITECTURE WAS STRANGELY APT 
WITHIN A FEW YEARS BOTH WERE HIGH ON THE LIST OF SOCIETY'S ILLS 
BOTH THE PRODUCT CIGARETTES 
AND THE CONTEXT WITH WHICH IT'S SUPPOSEDLY SHARING THESE WONDERFUL GLEAMING VALUES THE SKYSCRAPER 
HAVE BOTH GONE COMPLETELY OUT OF FASHION 
CIGARETTE ADVERTISING WAS BANNED NOT LONG AFTERWARDS 
AND IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT A HIGH RISE BUILDING RONAN POINT ACTUALLY STARTED TO FALL DOWN 
THAT WAS THE EMBLEMATIC POINT AT WHICH THE WHOLE DREAM OF MODERNISM BEGAN TO GO WRONG 
PEOPLE SAID THIS ISN'T THE WAY FORWARD 
ARE WE LIVING UNDER GREATER PRESSURE THAN EVER BEFORE 
ARE WORDS LIKE STRESS AND STRAIN MERELY A FASHION DOES IT GO DEEPER 
MIND AND BODY ARE WE NATURALLY AGGRESSIVE OR DO WE LEARN AGGRESSION 
MIND AND BODY SEX APPEAL WHAT IS IT HAVE YOU GOT IT 
MIND AND BODY YOU OWE IT TO YOUR FAMILY 
AS THE SIXTIES DREAM TURNED SOUR RENEWED ANXIETIES NEEDED REASSURANCE 
CONSUMERS WERE RECEPTIVE TO A SIMPLER GLOBAL MESSAGE 
I'D LIKE TO BUY THE WORLD A HOME AND FURNISH IT WITH LOVE 
GROW APPLE TREES AND HONEY BEES AND SNOW WHITE TURTLE DOVES 
I'D LIKE TO TEACH THE WORLD TO SING IN PERFECT HARMONY 
I'D LIKE TO BUY THE WORLD A COKE AND KEEP IT COMPANY 
THAT'S THE REAL THING COKE IS 
I'D LIKE TO TEACH THE WORLD TO SING IN PERFECT HARMONY 
I'D LIKE TO BUY THE WORLD A COKE AND KEEP IT COMPANY 
IT'S THE REAL THING COKE IS WHAT THE WORLD WANTS TODAY 
COCA COLA HAD DISCOVERED THE COUNTER CULTURE 
THE VALUES OF THE COUNTER CULTURE WERE ANTI CAPITALIST 
THEY WERE COMMUNITARIAN AND VEGETARIAN 
WE ALL LIVED IN ONE WORLD OF PEACE AND HARMONY 
OF COURSE THAT PEACE AND HARMONY WAS DEFENDED BY THE AMERICAN DOLLAR AND THE AMERICAN FLEET 
THAT ADVERTISEMENT IS ACTUALLY SAYING 
THAT THE WESTERN WORLD HAS BECOME DOMINATED BY COCA COLA CIVILISATION 
WOULDN'T A FESTIVAL FOR THE WHOLE WORLD BE GREAT COCA COLA HAD MASTERED THE WIDE EMBRACE 
BY SUGGESTING WE WERE ALL MEMBERS OF A GLOBAL FAMILY COKE TAPPED EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL YEARNINGS 
MORE POTENT THAN I WANT WAS I BELONG 
FEW BRANDS MATCHED COKE'S GLOBAL MARKET BUT THEY COPIED COKE'S HYMN TO HAPPINESS 
WE'VE GOT THE WHOLE WORLD WAKING UP 
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DRINK IN THE WORLD 
IT'S THE BRIGHT TASTE OF THE RIGHT ONE THAT'S MARTINI 
BIRDS EYE FISHFINGERS 
BIRDS EYE FISHFINGERS 
MAJOR BRANDS WERE ADOPTING THE GLOBAL SING ALONG WITH THE BANAL GENERALITY 
BUT PETROL COMPANIES AMONG OTHERS WERE SELLING THEMSELVES AS A GOOD TIME ACCESSORY FOR THE LAST TIME 
HAZARDS WERE APPROACHING WHICH WOULD REQUIRE ESSO TO RE POSITION RADICALLY 
AT THE START OF THE SEVENTIES WE WERE ALL CAREFREE GETAWAY PEOPLE 
PETROL WAS EASY TO COME BY AND RELATIVELY CHEAP 
THEN IN A MATTER OF A FEW MONTHS ALL THAT CHANGED 
WE HAD THE YOM KIPPUR WAR 
OPEC PUT UP THE PRICE OF PETROL FOURFOLD 
WE HAD THE MINERS' STRIKE THE THREE DAY WEEK AND THE SAVE IT CAMPAIGN 
PEOPLE REALISED YOU COULDN'T TAKE ENERGY FOR GRANTED 
THEY SUDDENLY TURNED ROUND TO THE OIL COMPANIES AND SAID WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT 
TO FIND NORTH SEA OIL TO BUILD BIGGER RIGS AND PLATFORMS 
TO LAY LARGER UNDERSEA PIPELINES 
THEN TO GET THE OIL ASHORE IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO MAKE BRITAIN SELF SUFFICIENT BY NINETEEN EIGHTY 
ALL THIS REQUIRES INVENTIVENESS TENACITY AND EXPERIENCE WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN HERE FROM THE START 
DESPITE ESSO'S CORPORATE OPTIMISM NORTH SEA OIL WAS SLOW TO COME ASHORE 
COMMERCIALS URGED VIEWERS TO SWITCH OFF 
AND MAKE LIGHT OF OUR DEPENDENCY ON NEW PAYMASTERS 
WITH THE ECONOMY AT THE MERCY OF THE ARABS 
VIEWERS WERE REMINDED THAT BRITAIN STILL HELD A MONOPOLY ON WIT 
SHALL WE SIGN THEY'VE GOT US OVER A BARREL 
HAVING TROUBLE YOUR HIGHNESS ALLOW ME 
IT'S A PARKER BRITISH IN THE DESERT THE INK WILL NEVER RUN DRY 
NO LET'S HOPE WE CAN SAY THE SAME ABOUT YOUR OIL 
AN AUSTERE BRITAIN WAS NO PLACE FOR THE GETAWAY PEOPLE THEIR CRUISING WAS IRRESPONSIBLE 
EVERY SUNDAY HUNDREDS OF MOTORISTS GET IN THEIR CAR AND JUST GO FOR A DRIVE 
THEY HOPE THAT SOMETHING INTERESTING WILL TURN UP 
ALL TOO OFTEN IT'S A WASTE OF TIME AND PETROL TEXACO FEEL PETROL IS TOO PRECIOUS TO WASTE 
SO WE'VE COME UP WITH SOME IDEAS 
THE MAKING OUT OF THE SIXTIES TURNED TO THE MAKING DO OF THE SEVENTIES 
THIS CHAIR IS TOO TORN TO LIVE WITH MAKE IT GOOD AGAIN WITH VINYL WELD 
WE CAN'T AFFORD A FREEZER NOW DON'T SAY ANYTHING WE'VE GOT NO MONEY 
THIS SUNDAY TRY AN ALMOST ROAST 
HOWEVER PRUDENT THE HOUSEWIFE ONE ASPECT OF THE RECESSION WAS UNAVOIDABLE INFLATION HIT TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT 
DURING THE SOUR SEVENTIES WITH INFLATION AND STAGNATION 
THE ADVERTISERS LOOKED ROUND FOR WHAT COULD BE MOST REASSURING AT A TIME LIKE THAT THE PAST 
LAST ON MY ROUND WOULD BE OLD MA PEGGITY'S PLACE 
T'WAS LIKE TAKING BREAD TO THE TOP OF THE WORLD 
T'WAS A GRAND RIDE BACK THOUGH 
I KNEW BAKER WOULD HAVE KETTLE ON AND DOORTSTEPS OF HOVIS READY 
THERE'S WHEATGERM IN THAT LOAF HE'D SAY 
GET THAT INSIDE YOU BOY 
HOVIS STILL HAS MANY TIMES MORE WHEATGERM THAN ORDINARY BREAD 
PEOPLE STARTED LOOKING FOR A TIME WHEN EVERYTHING WAS LOVELY THE GOOD OLD DAYS 
IT WAS A MYTH THEY HADN'T ENJOYED THE GOOD OLD DAYS 
BUT THEY LOOKED BACK FOR A MORE SETTLED WORLD ADVERTISING REFLECTED THIS IN AN EXTREME WAY 
AH THOSE LAZY SUMMER DAYS I CAN FEEL THE WARMTH OF THAT SUN NOW 
AND THAT FRESH SMELL OF NEW CUT WHEAT EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT TODAY 
NOT EVERYTHING WEETABIX IS STILL THE SAME 
AS COMMERCIALS TOOK ON THE LOOK OF OLD MASTER PAINTINGS CLASSICAL MUSIC REPLACED THE JINGLE 
LASHINGS OF NOSTALGIA ALLOWED THE VIEWER TO RETREAT SAFELY INTO AN IMAGINED PAST 
WHERE IT WAS LOCATED HARDLY MATTERED 
CELEBRATING THE NEW WAS NOW OUT OF THE QUESTION 
ADVERTISERS SET A PREMIUM ON ALL THAT WAS OLD FASHIONED 
AND INVITED VIEWERS TO REMINISCE 
I REMEMBER MY MOTHER GIVING IT TO ME 
GET SOME INSTANT MEMORIES TODAY 
FUNNY HOW YOU ONLY REMEMBER THE NICE THINGS 
THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF A BRAND IS THAT IT HAS EMOTIONAL APPEAL 
IN A WORLD WHICH IS UNCERTAIN BRANDS ARE TO SOME EXTENT FIXED POINTS 
TRUST TEXACO WE'LL HELP YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR MOTORING 
LEADING BRANDS WERE A BULWARK 
SO MUCH WAS CHANGING IN LIFE A PRIVATE LABEL WAS GROWING IN MANY MARKETS 
A PRESSURE BY THE FEELING OF THE TIME NOT ACTUALLY BY THE REALITY OF ECONOMICS 
THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER YOU MUST GO FOR THE CHEAPEST 
IN FACT PEOPLE DID NOT GO FOR THE CHEAPEST 
THEY WENT FOR THE HIGH VALUE END OF THE EQUATION 
WITH NEW MAXWELL HOUSE YOU GET MORE TASTE IN THE CUP 
THAT'S GOOD IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS GETTING BETTER 
BRITISH BRANDS MET FOREIGN COMPETITION WITH A PATRIOTIC FLOURISH 
THE BEST OF BRITISH 
THE PROBLEM WAS FOREIGNERS COULD PLAY THE SAME GAME 
SIZZLE OF BACON 
WHEN IT COMES TO BACON 
ONE NAME IS ENJOYED BY MORE HOMES IN THIS COUNTRY 
FOR ITS CONSISTENT HIGH QUALITY THAN ANY OTHER DANISH 
I THINK BY THE MID TO LATE SEVENTIES WE REALISED WE WERE SLIPPING BADLY 
A GOOD PRODUCT COULD COME FROM ANYWHERE 
YOU LOOKED AT WHAT YOU WERE WEARING DRIVING IT COULD COME FROM ANYWHERE 
SONG FROM FIGARO 
WE KNEW THAT WE COULDN'T COMPETE BECAUSE WE HAD THE BRITISH DISEASE WE WENT OUT ON STRIKE 
OUR ARROGANCE WAS KILLING US 
ALL WE COULD DO TO KEEP UP OUR SPIRITS WAS TO SAY 
BRITISH IS BEST AND IF IT ISN'T IT SHOULD BE THEY'LL SEE SENSE IF WE GO ON TALKING ABOUT IT LOUDLY 
THE TROUBLE WAS WE DIDN'T PERSUADE OURSELVES WITH ALL THAT RHETORIC 
AND WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T PERSUADE ANYONE ELSE 
FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS BRITAIN HAS BEEN INVADED 
BY THE ITALIANS THE GERMANS THE JAPANESE AND THE FRENCH 
WE HAVE THE MEANS TO FIGHT BACK 
THE NEW AUSTIN METRO 
THE NEW AUSTIN METRO A BRITISH CAR TO BEAT THE WORLD 
BRITAIN WANTED NEW DIRECTION NORTH SEA OIL GAVE HER A FIGHTING CHANCE 
EMOTIVE SYMBOLS LIKE ESSO'S TIGER CONVEYED THE HOPES OF A NEW GOVERNMENT 
THE POLITICAL AGENDA WAS SIMPLE IT WAS UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL 
TIGERS WERE STRONG AND INDEPENDENT BUT THEY ALSO HAD THEIR VICTIMS 
HELP THEM TO HELP THEMSELVES 
WE DIDN'T REALISE IT AT THE TIME BUT THERE WAS A CHANGE OF ATTITUDE WHEN MRS. THATCHER CAME IN 
THE LATE SEVENTIES WERE A SLOUGH OF DESPOND 
WHATEVER ONE THINKS OF MRS. THATCHER SHE GAVE PEOPLE A SENSE OF NATIONAL PURPOSE 
THE AD WE RAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY IS I THINK A POTTED VERSION OF THATCHERISM 
WE IN ESSO BELIEVE YOU CAN'T TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE YOUR BUSINESS WITHOUT ALSO HELPING BRITAIN 
YOU CAN'T SHOW CONFIDENCE IN THE COUNTRY'S FUTURE WITHOUT INVESTING IN THE COUNTRY NOW 
YOU CAN'T INVEST IN NEW INDUSTRY WITHOUT GENERATING NEW JOBS 
AND YOU CAN'T CLIMB OUT OF A RECESSION BY POINTING YOUR NOSE DOWNHILL 
THIS YEAR WE WILL BE INVESTING SIX HUNDRED MILLION WHICH IS GOOD FOR YOU 
GOOD FOR US AND GOOD FOR THE FUTURE OF BRITAIN 
THE AD IS BASED LOOSELY ON ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S INAUGURAL SPEECH WHICH WAS ABOUT THE ENTERPRISE CULTURE 
GOOD FOR US GOOD FOR YOU GOOD FOR BRITAIN COULD BE AN ANTHEM FOR THE TORY PARTY OR MRS. THATCHER 
IF PARADISE IS HALF AS NICE AS THE WIMPEY HOME YOU TAKE ME TO 
WHO NEEDS PARADISE I'D RATHER HAVE YOU 
IN THE EIGHTIES PARADISE WAS SUPPLANTED BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY YOUR OWN HOME AND CRAM IT WITH POSSESSIONS 
ADVERTISING HAD ALWAYS TALKED TO PEOPLE AS CONSUMERS 
NOW GOVERNMENT DID THE SAME CONSUMERISM WAS ENSHRINED AS SOCIETY'S FIRST PRINCIPLE 
TAKING A STAKE IN BRITAIN'S PROPERTY AND SHARE OWNING DEMOCRACY WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE 
TELEVISION WAS THE CHIEF MESSENGER 
PEOPLE'S CLASS AND BACKGROUND WERE NO LONGER SAID TO MATTER 
ALL YOU NEEDED WAS MONEY 
I WANT MONEY LOADSAMONEY THAT'S WHAT I WANT 
I GUARANTEE SOMEONE'S GOTTA WIN A MILLION 
MY CLOTHES ARE EXPENSIVE BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY ABOUT 
THAT'S WHAT I WANT ELECTRIC MONEY TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY 
YOUR LOVE GIVES ME SUCH A THRILL 
ASK ABOUT EQUITY RELEASE 
BUT YOUR LOVE WON'T PAY MY BILL I WANT MONEY THAT'S WHAT I WANT 
THIS STRIDENT INDIVIDUALISM WAS EXONERATED BY THE POPULAR CONVICTION 
THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO NATIONAL RECOVERY 
JOANNE THERE'S SOMETHING YOU OUGHT TO KNOW IT CONCERNS THE HOUSE AND THE KIDS 
WELL IT'S TIME TO GO IT ALONE 
I'M STARTING MY OWN BUSINESS JOHN AND IAN ARE WITH ME 
AS MORE PEOPLE BECAME MORE PROSPEROUS 
THE OBJECTS THEY OWNED BECAME PARAMOUNT 
THE COMPANY CAR WILL HAVE TO GO BACK 
YOU'RE NOT BEING A BIT HASTY ARE YOU 
EIGHTIES BRANDS WERE ICONS OF SUCCESS 
THE VALUES OF EIGHTIES COMMERCIALS CAME OUT OF THE CONCEPT OF A DIALOGUE 
YOU'RE TALKING TO AN INDIVIDUAL RATHER THAN TO THE AD MASS 
FOR THOSE WHO APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE 
THE INDIVIDUAL WAS WHAT MATTERED WE DON'T COMPROMISE WHY SHOULD YOU 
THEIR ABILITY TO FEED THEIR FAMILY BETTER TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE 
WE'RE TALKING TO SMALLER GROUPS OF PEOPLE 
BECAUSE OF THIS THE MESSAGE BECOMES MORE FOCUSSED 
THIS IS THE NEW NORTH WEST AN AREA WORTH INVESTIGATING 
YOU SEE ADVERTISING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T INTERESTED IN AND A FEW PEOPLE ARE 
TWO YEARS IN NEW YORK AND HE THINKS HE CAN TELL US HOW TO RUN THINGS NO WAY 
I FIXED THINGS HE'S TRAVELLING OVERNIGHT ON THE RED EYE HE'LL BE EXHAUSTED 
HE WON'T HAVE TO TIME TO EXAMINE THOSE NEW FIGURES I SENT HIM 
HE'LL BE HUNGRY 
AND TIRED 
HE'LL BE BROUGHT STRAIGHT HERE LIKE A LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER 
CLUB WORLD DELIVERS THE BUSINESSMAN READY TO DO BUSINESS 
PLEASANT TRIP YES THANK YOU 
COMMERCIALS OF THE EIGHTIES REPRESENT A VIEW OF BRITAIN WHICH IS AT ONE TIME PROSPEROUS 
BUT AT ANOTHER TIME IS PROFOUNDLY BENT ON OPERATING REALITY 
THERE'S VERY LITTLE IDEALISM ACTUALLY THERE IT'S A MUCH MORE REALISTIC APPROACH TO LIFE 
WORKING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POSSIBLE 
AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT WINNING 
GET A GRIP WITH REGULAR HOLD 
IT'S ABOUT DISPLAY WILL GOLD BLEND BE TOO GOOD FOR YOUR GUESTS 
I THINK THEY COULD GET USED TO IT 
IT'S ABOUT PERFORMANCE SEE YOU IN VIENNA AT SEVEN 
IT'S ABOUT SUCCESS PRODUCTIVITY 
ITS HIGHEST EVER LEVEL 
EFFICIENCY 
WE'RE ABOUT THE CHEAPEST IN THE E. E. C. 
AND WORLDWIDE WE'RE A WORLD LEADER 
AT TIMES ADVERTISING PUSHED MATERIALISTIC STEREOTYPES TOO FAR BUT IT WAS REALITY 
WE DID HAVE A CITY OF LONDON CULTURE WHICH WAS VERY MATERIALISTIC 
AND ADVERTISING DID CONTAIN STEREOTYPES DRAWN FROM THAT CULTURE 
WE'RE BEGINNING NOT TO IDENTIFY WITH THEM ALREADY BUT IT WAS A REALITY 
THE STOCK MARKET COLLAPSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN TURNED THE TIDE AGAINST THE YUPPIE 
HIS CREDENTIALS AS ASPIRATIONAL HERO BEGAN TO LOOK A BIT HOLLOW 
INCREASINGLY HIS LIFE WAS EXPOSED AS DEVOID OF MEANING 
ADVERTISING WOULD ABANDON THE PURELY MATERIAL 
THERE WERE HIGHER VALUES 
HAPPINESS IS A CIGAR CALLED HAMLET 
IN THE EIGHTIES ONE SAW THE MOOD AS BEING ABOUT PERSONAL BUSINESS SUCCESS 
JET SETTING BUSINESSMEN CARVING EACH OTHER UP 
IT SEEMS THERE'S BEEN A SHIFT 
MUCH MORE PERSONAL VALUES SEEM TO BE COMING OUT 
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE GIVEN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE BOOM HAS NOW BURST 
WHEN PEOPLE ARE SATURATED WITH MATERIAL SUCCESS THEY INSTINCTIVELY TURN TO OTHER SOURCES OF VALUE 
THEY TIRE OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION 
AFTER THE ME DECADE WHICH ADVERTISING CHAMPIONED 
THIS IS THE U. S. DECADE THE INDIVIDUAL NO LONGER EXISTS APART FROM SOCIETY 
WHAT MATTER ARE FAMILY COMMUNITY AND PLANET 
LIFE IS FULL OF DECISIONS OF THE HEAD AND THE HEART YOUR NEXT CAR 
WILL IT HAVE A CATALYTIC CONVERTER THAT REMOVES NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF POLLUTANTS 
AT THE END OF THE EIGHTIES DRASTIC RE POSITIONING WAS IMPERATIVE 
AN AUDI SIMPLY TORE UP ITS PAST 
WILL IT BE ONE OF THE NEW GENERATION OF AUDIS 
VORSPRUNG DURCH TECHNIK AS YOUR HEAD AND YOUR HEART WOULD SAY 
WE ARE AT A BREAK POINT NOW 
GREENERY HAS EXPRESSED THE NEED 
VOTING BEHAVIOUR IN ELECTIONS HAS EXPRESSED THE NEED 
HOW WILL MANUFACTURERS AND ADVERTISERS CATCH UP 
WHERE IS THE LEADING EDGE OF THE VALUE CHANGE 
THE LEADING EDGE IS NOT IN THE BIG COMPANIES 
IT'S OUT WHERE THE THINKERS AND THE DOERS AND THE RISK TAKERS ARE 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING WE'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE ENTERPRISE CULTURE 
WE'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCTS IT REPRESENTS 
IN THAT SENSE THE CONSUMER BOOM OLD STYLE IS OVER 
A NEW STYLE OF VALUE LED CONSUMER BOOM A NEW VALUE SET IS BEING LOOKED FOR 
WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH THE STORM HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH 
AND DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK 
WALK ON WALK ON 
WITH HOPE IN YOUR HEART 
AND YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE 
YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE 
THE STRONGEST THREAD IN ADVERTISING SINCE THE WAR HAS BEEN THE TENSION BETWEEN TWO VIEWS OF THE CONSUMER 
ON THE ONE HAND THE PERSON WHO IS CONFIDENT REALLY GOING FOR THE FUTURE 
AND THEN THE PERSON WHO NEEDS TO BELONG WHO NEEDS TO FEEL PART OF SOCIETY 
OF COURSE THOSE TWO THREADS ARE WITHIN ALL OF US 
YOU CAN SEE A FASCINATING WORKING OUT OF THAT TENSION 
BETWEEN THE NEED TO BELONG 
AND THE RECOGNITION THAT WE ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS ALONE WITH OUR WORLD 
YOU'RE GOING TO WIN THE POOLS NO 
YOU HAVE A RICH UNCLE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT NO LOOK DAD 
IN THE ABSENCE OF THESE THINGS YOU MIGHT CONSIDER A PENSION 
A PENSION YES YOU GO INTO THE MIDLAND BANK 
YOU'LL RECOGNISE IT IT HAS A SIGN SAYING MIDLAND BANK 
YOU TELL THE GUY ALL ABOUT YOURSELF 
IN YOUR CASE THIS WILL NOT TAKE TOO LONG 
HE TELLS YOU WHICH PENSION IS BEST FOR YOU HUH 
YOU DO SOMETHING AND YOU DO IT NOW 
I DON'T WANT YOU TO END UP BEING A BURDEN TO MY GRANDSON O. K. O. K. 
GIVE HIM HERE 
I SUSPECT THAT THE EIGHTIES ENTERPRISE CULTURE 
AND THE HUGE SALARIES AND EGREGIOUS LIFESTYLE THAT YUPPYDOM PAINTED FOR A SHORT WHILE 
WHILST PERFECTLY LOGICAL IN TERMS OF THE MARKET SOCIETY 
HAVE NEVERTHELESS IN THIS SAD OLD COUNTRY OF OURS DONE FOR IT FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS 
BECAUSE WHAT IT HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS IS 
WHEN I'VE GOT THE WEALTH AS MUCH AS THE FREE MARKET WILL LET ME HAVE 
DO I NOW DO WITH MY LIFE 
FOR MYSELF FOR OTHER PEOPLE FOR THOSE THINGS I COME INTO CONTACT WITH 
AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED 
IT IS AS IF EVERY ELEMENT OF LIVING 
OTHER THAN ENTERPRISE AND FREE MARKETS AND PRIVATISATION HAS GONE BY THE BOARD 
AND THIS IS THE REAL DILEMMA OF OUR TIMES 
I AM THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD I AM THE HOPE OF MY NATION 
I AM TOMORROW'S PEOPLE I AM THE NEW INSPIRATION 
WE'VE GOT A SONG TO SING TO YOU 
WE'VE GOT A MESSAGE TO BRING TO YOU 
THIS IS FOR YOU AND FOR ME AND TOMORROW 
IF WE ALL CAN AGREE THERE'LL BE SWEET HARMONY TOMORROW 
AND WE ALL WILL BE THERE COCA COLA TO SHARE 
FEELING SO REAL AND SO TRUE 
PROMISE US TOMORROW AND WE'LL BUILD A BETTER WORLD FOR YOU 
THE WHOLE HISTORY OF ADVERTISING TELLS A TRUE STORY 
BUT AS ANY NOVELIST WILL TELL YOU THE BEST TRUTH IS FICTION 
THE PROBLEM WITH ADVERTISING IS THEY BECOME PERFECT COPIES OF ORIGINALS WHICH NEVER EXISTED 
HALF COMMUNE HALF ROCK BAND 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD CHANGE THE WORLD 
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO THE GROUP 
WE LIVE TOGETHER BECAUSE WE LOVE EACH OTHER 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THESE TWO SEVERLY AUTISTIC CHILDREN 
HAD PIONEERING THERAPY TO HELP THEM SPEAK 
WHAT DO YOU WANT I WANT APPLE 
THIS POLITICIAN WASN'T TAKING ANY PRISONERS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
YOU EITHER BE KILLED BY THEM OR KILL THEM I WANT TO SEE THEM DEAD 
AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIFTEEN PEOPLE SPENT AN ENTIRE YEAR LIVING IN THE IRON AGE 
BREAKFAST WAS ALMOST ALWAYS A PORRIDGE OF BOILED WHEAT WITH MILK 
AND HONEY IF THERE WAS ANY 
NOW A NEW SERIES CATCHES UP WITH THE CHARACTERS 
FROM SOME OF THE BEST B. B. C. DOCUMENTARIES OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS 
AND FINDS OUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
