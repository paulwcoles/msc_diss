HELLO AND WELCOME TO KEY STAGE THREE BITESIZE MATHS REVISION 
THE SERIES DESIGNED TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR EXAMS IN THE SUMMER 
WE'LL LOOK AT SOME IMPORTANT MATHS TOPICS YOU NEED TO REVISE 
ALONG WITH SOME SAMPLE QUESTIONS 
JUST WORK THROUGH THE PROGRAMME IN BITESIZE CHUNKS 
CONCENTRATING ON THOSE AREAS THAT YOU NEED THE MOST HELP WITH 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT ALGEBRA MEASURES AND SHAPE AND SPACE 
YOU CAN WORK THROUGH THE WHOLE MENU 
OR JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE AREAS WHERE YOU NEED THE MOST PRACTICE 
BASICALLY THE CHOICE IS YOURS 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE SECTION ON THE MYSTERIES OF ALGEBRA 
ALGEBRA IS A WAY OF REPRESENTING NUMBERS WITH LETTERS 
FOR EXAMPLE IF MY SISTER IS TWO YEARS OLDER THAN ME 
YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD TWO TO MY AGE TO GET HER AGE 
THIS IS ALWAYS TRUE 
MY AGE IS A 
HER AGE IS A TWO 
THE NUMBER OF CARS COULD BE N. 
HERE ARE MORE EXAMPLES OF USING LETTERS 
TO REPRESENT HOW NUMBERS BEHAVE 
THIS BATHROOM WALL IS CRYING OUT FOR A SPOT OF RE TILING 
THE PATTERN CAN BE DECIDED ON USING COMPUTER GRAPHICS 
AND CAN BE REPRESENTED ALGEBRAICALLY 
IF WE USE THREE COLOURS SAY GREEN BLUE AND RED TILES 
IT WILL HELP IF WE HAVE SOME KIND OF ORDER 
SUPPOSE WE HAVE ONE GREEN TILE 
FOUR BLUES TO SURROUND IT IN A CROSS SHAPE 
WITH CORNERS FILLED IN WITH RED TILES IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS 
HOW CAN THE PATTERN AND ITS COST BE EXPRESSED ALGEBRAICALLY 
LET'S GO TO OUR EXPERT 
TO TILE ONE SMALL SECTION OF THE WALL 
WITH THIS PATTERN 
WE WOULD NEED ONE GREEN TILE FOUR BLUE TILES AND FOUR RED TILES 
LET'S LOOK AT THE COST IN ALGEBRAIC TERMS 
IF WE WANT TO FIND THE TOTAL COST 
WHAT WE DO THEN IS WE MAKE A SIMPLE EXPRESSION 
REMEMBER WITH ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSION WE HAVE TERMS BUT NO EQUALS SIGN 
IF THERE WAS ONLY ONE TILE T. 
RATHER THAN WRITE ONE T. WE ALWAYS JUST WRITE T. 
SUBSTITUTION IS REPLACING A SYMBOL A LETTER OR AN ALGEBRAIC TERM 
IN AN EXPRESSION WITH A VALUE 
IN ORDER TO FIND THE TOTAL 
IF WE CONSIDER THE TILING PATTERN 
WE CAN SUBSTITUTE IN THE VALUES FOR THE TERMS 
IN ORDER TO FIND THE COST 
LET'S CONSIDER AN ORDER FORM 
THE COST OF THE GREEN TILES COULD COME UP ONE POINT TWO OH FOR EXAMPLE 
THE BLUE TILES COULD BE SAY ONE POINT ONE OH 
THE RED TILES MIGHT BE ONE POINT FIVE OH EACH 
WE CAN CALCULATE THE TOTAL COST FOR ONE SMALL SECTION OF WALL 
BY SUBSTITUTING THE VALUES FOR EACH OF THE TERMS IN THE EXPRESSION 
LET'S REMIND OURSELVES WHAT THAT EXPRESSION IS 
LET'S SUBSTITUTE IN THE VALUES FOR EACH OF THE TERMS 
IF WE CALCULATE THIS WE GET 
WHICH GIVES US A TOTAL OF ELEVEN POINT SIX OH 
THAT'S A TOTAL COST OF ELEVEN POINT SIX OH FOR ONE SMALL SECTION OF THE WALL 
LOOK AT THE NUMBER PATTERNS FORMED BY THESE ICE SKATERS 
HOW IS THIS FIGURE DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST 
AND THIS ONE 
WHAT WILL THE NEXT FIGURE LOOK LIKE 
AND HOW HAVE THE FIGURES BEEN FORMED 
YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE SEQUENCE 
AS ADDING ONE MORE SKATER TO EACH ARM OF THE CROSS 
MAYBE YOU SAW ONE SKATER IN THE MIDDLE 
WITH FOUR LINES OF SKATERS PIVOTING ROUND HER 
ANOTHER WAY WOULD BE TO SAY THERE WAS ONE LINE OF SKATERS 
WITH TWO SMALLER LINES JOINED TO IT 
THERE ARE ALSO OTHER POSSIBILITIES 
WE'VE GOT JUST FOUR FIGURES SO FAR BUT THERE COULD BE MANY MORE 
WHAT WOULD THE TENTH FIGURE IN THE SEQUENCE LOOK LIKE 
HOW MANY SKATERS WOULD IT HAVE 
HERE IS ONE WAY OF WORKING IT OUT 
IN EACH FIGURE THERE ARE FOUR EQUAL ARMS 
EACH ARM HAS ONE SKATER LESS THAN THE FIGURE NUMBER 
IN THE TENTH FIGURE THE ARMS WILL EACH HAVE NINE SKATERS 
FOUR X. NINE EQUALS THIRTY SIX PLUS THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE 
THAT'S THIRTY SEVEN SKATERS 
ALTERNATIVELY YOU COULD SEE EACH ARM AS TEN SKATERS LONG 
THE SAME AS THE FIGURE NUMBER BUT ALL SHARING SKATER NUMBER ONE 
FOUR X. TEN EQUALS FORTY 
BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY ONE SKATER NUMBER ONE WE SUBTRACT THREE 
FORTY THREE EQUALS THIRTY SEVEN 
ANOTHER WAY OF ARRIVING AT THE SAME ANSWER 
WITH A BIT OF THOUGHT YOU CAN CREATE A GENERAL RULE 
WHAT WOULD YOUR GENERAL RULE BE 
FOR PATTERN NUMBER ONE WE HAVE ONE SKATER 
FOR PATTERN NUMBER TWO WE HAVE ONE SKATER PLUS FOUR OTHERS 
FOR PATTERN NUMBER THREE WE HAVE ONE SKATER PLUS FOUR PLUS FOUR MORE 
FOR PATTERN NUMBER FOUR 
WE HAVE ONE SKATER PLUS FOUR PLUS FOUR AND FOUR MORE 
WE CAN THINK OF THESE NUMBER PATTERNS ANOTHER WAY 
PATTERN NUMBER ONE REMAINS THE SAME 
PATTERN NUMBER TWO IS ONE PLUS ONE GROUP OF FOUR 
PATTERN NUMBER THREE IS ONE PLUS TWO GROUPS OF FOUR 
PATTERN NUMBER FOUR IS ONE PLUS THREE GROUPS OF FOUR 
SUPPOSE WE WANTED TO THINK ABOUT OTHER NUMBER PATTERNS FOR TEN TWENTY 
FOR ANY NUMBER OF SKATERS WHICH WE COULD CALL N. 
LET'S LOOK AT THE PATTERNS AGAIN 
THIS THREE IS ONE LESS THAN THE NUMBER PATTERN 
AGAIN THIS NUMBER TWO IS ONE LESS THAN THE NUMBER PATTERN 
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN COME UP WITH A GENERAL EXPRESSION 
WE MULTIPLY THAT BY FOUR 
SO LET'S SIMPLIFY THIS 
AGAIN THAT CAN BE SIMPLIFIED BY ADDING THE ONE TO THE MINUS FOUR 
THERE IS OUR EXPRESSION 
LET'S CHECK TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS 
PATTERN NUMBER ONE IS WHEN N. EQUALS ONE 
SO FOUR N. THREE 
IS EQUAL TO FOUR X. ONE THREE 
WHICH IS ONE 
WE HAD ONE SKATER IN THE FIRST PATTERN 
PATTERN NUMBER TWO IS WHEN N. EQUALS TWO 
FOUR N. THREE 
IS EQUAL TO FOUR X. TWO THREE WHICH IS FIVE 
THERE WERE FIVE SKATERS IN THE SECOND PATTERN 
AND YES THERE WERE NINE SKATERS IN THE THIRD PATTERN 
THERE ARE INDEED THIRTEEN SKATERS IN THE FOURTH PATTERN 
WE CAN USE THE NTH TERM 
TO WORK OUT HOW MANY SKATERS THERE WOULD BE IN THE ONE HUNDREDTH PATTERN 
THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN SKATERS IN THE ONE HUNDREDTH PATTERN 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME TO ANSWER THE EXAM QUESTION 
THIS QUESTION IS ALL ABOUT THE TWENTIETH PATTERN 
THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT N. IS THE NUMBER OF THE PATTERN 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT BIDMAS A MATHEMATICAL RULE 
THAT IS A WAY OF MAKING SURE WE ADD SUBTRACT MULTIPLY AND DIVIDE IN THE CORRECT ORDER 
HOW DOES BIDMAS WORK IN PRACTICE 
APPLYING BIDMAS WE MULTIPLY FIRST THEN THE ADDITION 
SO THREE X. FOUR EQUALS TWELVE 
IF WE IGNORE THE BIDMAS RULE AND WORK FROM LEFT TO RIGHT 
WE CAN AVOID CONFUSION IF WE USE BRACKETS TO MAKE IT CLEAR 
BRACKETS ARE THE FIRST OPERATION 
ONLY BY USING BRACKETS CAN YOU MAKE IT CLEAR THAT YOU WANT TO DO THE ADDITION BEFORE THE MULTIPLICATION 
HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE 
THAT'S HOW YOU ADD BEFORE MULTIPLYING 
PUT THE ADDITION INSIDE A BRACKET 
WHAT ABOUT INDICES HOW DO THEY FIT IN 
INDICES ARE ALSO CALLED POWERS 
SQUARING AND CUBING ARE TYPES OF INDICES 
WHEN COMBINED WITH MULTIPLYING WE HAVE TO DO THE INDICES FIRST 
THEN THE MULTIPLYING AND FINALLY THE SUBTRACTING 
YOU'D NORMALLY SEE AN EXPRESSION LIKE THIS WRITTEN WITH BRACKETS 
TO MAKE THINGS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR 
TACKLE THE INDICES FIRST 
THREE SQUARED EQUALS NINE 
THEN WE DO THE MULTIPLICATION 
ONE LAST THING THE SQUARE ROOT IS TREATED LIKE AN INDEX 
YOU WOULD DO THE SQUARE ROOT AT THE SAME STAGE AS YOU WOULD AN INDEX 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME TO ANSWER THE EXAM QUESTION 
THE PATTERN THAT GOES WITH FOUR N. IS 
BRACKETS MEAN THAT WE ADD BEFORE WE SQUARE 
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO ANY FURTHER ONLY ONE PATTERN STARTS FOUR NINE 
REMEMBER THAT WE TACKLE THE INDICES BEFORE THE ADDITION 
AGAIN THERE IS ONLY ONE PATTERN THAT STARTS FOUR SEVEN 
WE COULD SAY THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE PATTERN AND ONE EXPRESSION LEFT 
SO WE JUST JOIN THEM UP 
IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO CHECK THAT THE PATTERN WORKS 
THIS MEANS N. MULTIPLIED BY N. EQUALS THREE 
REMEMBERING THAT THE CALCULATION INSIDE THE BRACKET IS DONE FIRST 
YES THIS DOES MATCH THE PATTERN FOUR TEN EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT 
IT IS SAFE TO JOIN THEM UP 
IF YOU'VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THIS 
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO CHECK THE CORRECT SOLUTIONS 
BY FINDING THE THIRD AND FOURTH TERM OF EVERY PATTERN 
ALSO NOTICE THAT FOUR IS THE FIRST TERM OF EVERY PATTERN 
YOU HAVE TO CHECK AT LEAST TWO TERMS 
TO MAKE SURE EACH PATTERN IS CORRECTLY MATCHED 
NOW FOR PART B. 
YOU HAVE TO CREATE THE NUMBER PATTERN BY USING THE NTH TERM 
THE POWER OF THREE MEANS YOU HAVE TO CUBE THE NUMBER 
WE USUALLY SAY N. CUBED 
THE FIRST TERM WHEN N. EQUALS ONE IS 
THE NEXT TERM IS WHEN N. EQUALS TWO 
THE THIRD TERM IS WHEN N. EQUALS THREE 
THE LAST TERM IS WHEN N. EQUALS FOUR 
THIS GIVES THE COMPLETE ANSWER OF FOUR ELEVEN THIRTY SIXTY SEVEN 
WHEN YOU GET AN NTH TERM 
YOU HAVE TO USE N. EQUALS ONE N. EQUALS TWO 
N. EQUALS THREE AND SO ON TO GET THE FIRST FEW TERMS 
LET'S FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THESE UNKNOWN VALUES 
MIDNIGHT DOWNTOWN 
IT'S DARK IT'S DINGY IT'S DEPRESSING 
WE'RE TAILING PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE AND GETTING NOWHERE 
THE UNKNOWN WE'VE CALLED IT 
WHY 
WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW HIS TRUE IDENTITY THAT'S WHY 
ALL WE HAVE TO GO ON IS A LIST OF THE DISGUISES HE'S KNOWN TO USE 
THREE OF HIS FAVOURITES ARE X. 
AND Z. 
HE'S USED A AND B. AS WELL 
WE'RE UP AGAINST A GUY WHO KNOWS HIS ALPHABET ALL RIGHT 
IT DOESN'T MEAN HE STICKS TO LETTERS 
SOMETIMES HE'S FOOLED US BY PUTTING ON A DIFFERENT OUTFIT 
LIKE A QUESTION MARK 
LITTLE DOES HE KNOW HIS LITTLE GAME IS ABOUT TO COME TO A FULL STOP 
A STUDENT TIPS US OFF THAT THE UNKNOWN HAS BEEN SEEN 
SKULKING AROUND IN THE SHADOWS OF EQUATION ALLEY 
A SMALL TEAM OF OUR TOP NUMBERS RACES TO THE SCENE 
SURE ENOUGH THERE HE IS 
HE'S GOT HIS FAVOURITE Z. DISGUISE ON AND IS PEERING OUT FROM AN EQUATION 
THE TEAM LOAD THEIR NOTEBOOKS AND STEAM IN 
RECORDING DETAILS AS THEY GO 
THEY CLOSE IN AND THE UNKNOWN PANICS 
HE TURNS HIMSELF INTO THE WEIRDEST SYMBOL HE THINKS OF AND RUNS FOR IT 
WE LET HIM GO WE'LL PICK HIM UP LATER 
WE'VE GOT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE NEED 
WE'VE GOT HIM 
THE IDENTITY OF THE UNKNOWN IS THIRTEEN 
IT ALL ADDS UP 
BUT THIRTEEN'S JUST ONE UNKNOWN 
IN ALL THE EQUATIONS IN ALL THE WORLD THERE ARE MANY MORE 
THEIR DAYS ARE NUMBERED THOUGH 
AND THEY KNOW IT 
TO SOLVE AN EQUATION 
WE NEED TO FIND OUT THE NUMERICAL VALUE OF THE UNKNOWN 
LET'S TAKE THE EXAMPLE THREE X. EQUALS NINE 
WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN IS WHAT X. IS 
NOW IT'S EASY TO SEE 
SO THEN X. EQUALS THREE 
THERE'S OUR ANSWER 
IT'S HELPFUL TO REMEMBER THAT AN EQUATION CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS A BALANCE 
LET'S TAKE THIS EXAMPLE 
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO FIND X. ON ITS OWN 
AT THE MOMENT X. HAS ELEVEN SUBTRACTED FROM IT 
WE NEED TO ADD ELEVEN SO THIS BECOMES ZERO 
LEAVING X. ON ITS OWN 
REMEMBERING OUR RULE WHAT'S DONE TO THE LEFT HAND SIDE 
MUST ALSO BE DONE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE EQUATION 
WHAT DOES THIS GIVE US 
WE CAN SUBSTITUTE THE VALUE WE HAVE INTO THE ORIGINAL EQUATION 
TO CHECK WE'VE DONE THIS CORRECTLY 
YES IT'S CORRECT 
WE CAN MAKE EQUATIONS MORE COMPLICATED 
BY INCLUDING MULTIPLICATION OR DIVISION AND ADDITION OR SUBTRACTION 
LET'S CONSIDER THIS EQUATION 
WHAT WE'RE AIMING FOR IS N. EQUALS A NUMBER 
FIRST OF ALL LET'S FIND FOUR N. 
IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE'VE GOT FOUR N. SEVEN 
SO LET'S ADD SEVEN TO MAKE THIS ZERO WHICH WILL LEAVE US WITH JUST FOUR N. 
WHAT'S DONE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THIS EQUATION MUST ALSO BE DONE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE EQUATION 
SO OUR EQUALS SIGN STILL WORKS 
WHAT DO WE HAVE NOW 
RIGHT WE'VE GOT FOUR TIMES N. 
TO GET N. ON ITS OWN WE DIVIDE BY FOUR 
REMEMBERING A NUMBER DIVIDED BY ITSELF EQUALS ONE OR ONE N. 
DOING THE SAME TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE EQUATION 
WHAT DOES THAT GIVE US 
WE CAN TAKE THIS VALUE OF N. 
AND SUBSTITUTE IT IN THE ORIGINAL EQUATION 
TO SEE IF WE'VE DONE THIS CORRECTLY 
IT'S CORRECT 
LOOK AT THIS EQUATION 
X. IS ON BOTH SIDES SO IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND THE VALUE OF X. 
CAN YOU THINK OF A NUMBER THAT WORKS 
TRY MORE NUMBERS AND SEE IF YOU CAN MAKE BOTH SIDES EQUAL 
WE'VE TRIED GUESSWORK BUT TO SAVE TIME WE CAN BALANCE THE EQUATION 
LET'S TRY THIS METHOD 
WE'RE GOING TO SUBTRACT X. FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION 
SO LET'S GET THE TWO X. ON ITS OWN 
NOW TO GET X. ON ITS OWN 
HERE'S ANOTHER EQUATION 
IN EARLIER EQUATIONS WE TOOK SUBTRACTED AND ADDED NUMBERS FROM BOTH SIDES 
THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO SUBTRACT X. FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION 
WE TAKE TWO X. FROM BOTH SIDES THAT MAKES THE EQUATION EASIER TO SOLVE 
LOOK WHAT HAPPENS THERE'S NO X. ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE 
THE OBJECT IS TO GET X. BY ITSELF ON ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION 
TO DO THIS WE HAVE TO SUBTRACT FIFTY THREE FROM BOTH SIDES 
WE HAVE TO DIVIDE BY THIRTY TWO BECAUSE WE HAVE TO UNDO THE MULTIPLYING BY THIRTY TWO 
THIS QUESTION HAS TO BE DONE WITHOUT A CALCULATOR 
WE FIRST NEED TO GET ALL THE UNKNOWN Y. S. ONTO ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION 
IT'S EASIER TO SOLVE AN EQUATION WHEN THERE ARE Y. TERMS ON ONE SIDE 
LET'S SUBTRACT THREE Y. FROM BOTH SIDES 
NOW TAKE AWAY ONE FROM EACH SIDE 
WE NOW HAVE TO HALVE THE THIRTEEN TO GET Y. BECAUSE DOUBLE Y. IS THIRTEEN 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON ALGEBRA 
IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND JUST TAKE ANOTHER LOOK 
THE NEXT SECTION LOOKS IN SOME DETAIL AT MEASURES 
INCLUDING PERIMETER AREA AND VOLUME 
WHAT BETTER WAY TO KICK OFF THAN WITH SOME DEFINITIONS 
THE PERIMETER OF A TWO DIMENSIONAL SHAPE 
IS THE DISTANCE ALL THE WAY ROUND THE OUTSIDE 
I'M BACK AT MY OLD SCHOOL AND WE'VE BORROWED SOME OF DAVID'S SKI PASSES 
I KNOW HE LOVES SHOWING THEM OFF 
SO I'M GOING TO MAKE A NICE FRAME SO HE CAN DISPLAY THEM 
I'VE PLACED THEM ON TEN C. M. SQUARED BITS OF CARD 
BEFORE WE GO FURTHER WE NEED TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH WOOD WE NEED 
WE DO THIS BY WORKING OUT THE PERIMETER 
WHICH IS ALL THE WAY AROUND THE EDGE 
OF ALL THE CARDS 
DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LAY THE CARDS DOWN THE PERIMETER WILL CHANGE I'VE LAID THEM OUT IN A ROW 
IF I MOVE THE CARDS AND PUT THEM IN ROWS OF TWO 
THE PERIMETER WORKS OUT AT 
DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LAY THE CARDS THE AREA STAYS THE SAME BUT THE PERIMETER CHANGES 
WHEN IT COMES TO CIRCLES WORKING OUT THE PERIMETER AND AREA 
IS POSSIBLE ONCE WE KNOW THE DIAMETER OR RADIUS 
THE PERIMETER OF A CIRCLE IS ALSO CALLED THE CIRCUMFERENCE 
IT'S ALWAYS JUST OVER THREE TIMES THE DIAMETER 
ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED FOURTEEN TIMES LARGER 
OR TO BE MORE ACCURATE 
THIS DECIMAL GOES ON AND ON FOR EVER AND EVER WITH NO REPEATING 
SO WE CAN NEVER WRITE THE ENTIRE NUMBER DOWN 
MATHEMATICIANS CALL THIS NUMBER BY THE SIMPLE NAME PI A GREEK LETTER 
WHATEVER THE SIZE OF THE CIRCLE 
PI ALWAYS REMAINS THE SAME 
THIS IS TRUE OF ALL CIRCLES WHATEVER THEIR SIZE 
IT WOULD BE TRUE IF YOU DREW A CIRCLE AROUND THE EARTH 
AND DIVIDED THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE EARTH BY THE DIAMETER 
THE RESULT WOULD BE THE SAME 
LET'S GO TO OUR EXPERT FOR MORE EXAMPLES 
OF FINDING CIRCUMFERENCES OF CIRCLES 
TO FIND THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THIS CIRCLE 
I NOTICE THAT THE DIAMETER IS ELEVEN C. M. 
I'LL USE A FORMULA TO WORK OUT THE CIRCUMFERENCE 
PI WE CAN APPROXIMATE TO BE ABOUT 
WE MULTIPLY THAT BY THE DIAMETER I'LL WORK THAT OUT ON MY CALCULATOR 
IF I DON'T HAVE A CALCULATOR HOW DO I WORK OUT THE CIRCUMFERENCE 
I'VE GOT A RADIUS OF TWENTY FIVE C. M. 
BUT FOR THE FORMULA YOU NEED TO KNOW THE DIAMETER 
LET'S TRY AND WORK OUT THE DIAMETER TWENTY FIVE X. TWO EQUALS DIAMETER WHICH IS FIVE 
I HAVEN'T GOT A CALCULATOR SO I'M GOING TO APPROXIMATE PI 
I'M GOING TO ROUND IT DOWN TO THREE 
IF A QUESTION ASKS FOR AN APPROXIMATE CIRCUMFERENCE 
LET'S LOOK AT COUNTING THE AREA INSIDE A SHAPE 
THE AREA OF A TWO DIMENSIONAL SHAPE IS THE AMOUNT OF SPACE IT COVERS 
THE UNITS OF AREA ARE CALLED SQUARE UNITS 
HERE'S OUR EXPERT 
THIS SQUARE HAS GOT A LENGTH OF ONE C. M. AND A WIDTH OF ONE C. M. 
ANY SQUARE WITH THESE DIMENSIONS IS CALLED A UNIT SQUARE 
WHETHER IT'S IN CENTIMETRES MILLIMETRES KILOMETRES OR METRES 
WE WRITE SQUARED BY PUTTING A LITTLE TWO ABOVE THE CM 
OR YOU CAN WRITE IT AS 
I'VE GOT A RECTANGLE WITH AN AREA OF 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX 
DON'T FORGET YOUR TWO TO SHOW THAT IT IS CENTIMETRES SQUARED 
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THIS ROOM NEEDS A PAINT JOB 
WE NEED TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH PAINT WE NEED 
BY WORKING OUT THE TOTAL AREA OF ALL THE WALLS STARTING WITH THE CHIMNEY BREAST 
THIS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD COS IT'S A PLAIN RECTANGLE 
WE KNOW THAT THE AREA OF A RECTANGLE IS JUST ITS LENGTH TIMES ITS WIDTH 
THAT WAS STRAIGHTFORWARD WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE WE DON'T WANT TO PAINT THE DOOR 
WITH COMPLICATED SHAPES IT'S BEST TO SPLIT THEM UP TO WORK OUT THE AREA 
THIS CAN BE DIVIDED UP INTO TWO RECTANGLES LIKE THIS 
ADDING THEM UP GIVES THE TOTAL AREA 
YOU MIGHT HAVE SPOTTED ANOTHER WAY TO WORK IT OUT 
HOW ABOUT SUBTRACTING THE AREA OF THE DOOR FROM THE AREA OF THE WALL 
LET'S GO OVER THE FORMULAS FOR FINDING AREAS OF DIFFERENT SHAPES 
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT TRIANGLE 
COPY IT ROTATE THE COPY THROUGH ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
JOIN IT TO THE ORIGINAL TRIANGLE WE'VE MADE A PARALLELOGRAM 
IT SHOULD HAVE AN AREA THAT IS TWICE THAT OF THE TRIANGLE 
THAT'S TWICE THE AREA OF THE TRIANGLE 
NO CALCULATORS ON PAPER ONE 
THIS QUESTION IS ALL ABOUT PERIMETER AND AREA 
MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE CLEAR WHICH IS WHICH 
IF NECESSARY GO BACK AND HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE LESSONS 
LET'S LOOK AT THE FIRST SQUARE A 
THE AREA IS THE NUMBER OF CENTIMETRE SQUARES INSIDE THE SHAPE 
THE PERIMETER IS THE LENGTH AROUND THE OUTSIDE 
THERE ARE FOUR SIDES AND THEY ARE ALL EIGHT C. M. LONG 
WHEN WE FOLD THE SQUARE IN HALF WE GET A RECTANGLE 
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO WRITE THE DIMENSIONS ON THE SHAPE 
THE AREA IS HALF WHAT IT WAS BEFORE 
BECAUSE TWO OF THESE FIT INSIDE THE SQUARE 
OR YOU CAN USE LENGTH X. WIDTH AGAIN 
NOW FOR THE PERIMETER CAREFUL IT HAS NOT HALVED 
THE RECTANGLE B. HAS BEEN HALVED TO GET SHAPE C. 
WRITE IN THE DIMENSIONS AGAIN 
THE AREA HAS BEEN HALVED SO IT'S NOW EQUAL TO THIRTY TWO DIVIDED BY TWO 
THE SQUARE IS FOLDED IN HALF SO THE AREA MUST BE DIVIDED BY TWO 
SIXTY FOUR DIVIDED BY TWO 
LET'S THINK ABOUT THE DIAGONAL WHICH HAS BECOME THE LONGEST SIDE 
IT'S THE LONGEST SIDE SO IT MUST BE LONGER THAN EIGHT C. M. 
IF WE ADDED THREE EIGHTS TOGETHER WE WOULD GET EXACTLY TWENTY FOUR C. M. 
ONE SIDE IS MORE THAN EIGHT C. M. SO THE PERIMETER IS GREATER THAN TWENTY FOUR C. M. 
IS THE DIAGONAL OF A SQUARE ALWAYS LONGER THAN THE LENGTH OF A SIDE 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CLIP 
ANNA IS MEASURING A LEAF 
TO CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF CARBON DIOXIDE IT ABSORBS PER MINUTE 
SHE'LL DO THIS FOR A SAMPLE OF TEN TO COMPARE EFFICIENCY IN THE CANOPY 
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW HOW MUCH CARBON DIOXIDE A LEAF ABSORBS IN RELATION TO ITS SURFACE AREA 
SO THE AREA NEEDS TO BE ESTIMATED 
HOW WOULD YOU DO THIS HOW WOULD YOU ESTIMATE THE AREA OF A LEAF 
WHEN WE MEASURE A LINE WE FILL IT WITH UNITS OF LENGTH WHICH WE COUNT 
THIS LINE IS ABOUT FOUR UNITS LONG 
WHEN WE MEASURE A SURFACE WE COVER IT COMPLETELY WITH UNITS OF AREA 
ALL THE SAME SIZE SO EACH COVERS THE SAME AMOUNT OF SURFACE 
THESE PIECES ARE ALL THE SAME SIZE AND FIT TOGETHER WITHOUT GAPS 
BUT YOU COULD HARDLY SAY THE AREA WAS EIGHT BIRDS 
YOU COULD USE HEXAGONS 
OR POSSIBLY TRIANGLES 
BUT IT'S EASIEST TO USE SQUARES 
WE FIND THE AREA OF THIS SHAPE BY COUNTING THE SQUARES WHICH COVER IT 
LET'S START WITH THE WHOLE SQUARES 
UP TO TWENTY EIGHT BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T FOUND THE WHOLE AREA 
SOME SQUARES LIE PARTLY INSIDE AND PARTLY OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARY 
HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITH THESE 
ONE WAY IS TO ASSUME THAT THE ONES THAT ARE MORE THAN HALF FULL 
MAKE UP FOR SQUARES WHICH ARE LESS THAN HALF FULL 
IN THE LABORATORY CHRIS PUTS A DOT IN THE WHOLE SQUARES 
THESE ARE ONE C. M. EACH WAY SO THEY HAVE AN AREA OF ONE SQUARE CENTIMETRE 
SHE DOES THE SAME FOR THE PART SQUARES AND DIVIDES THIS BY TWO 
TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SQUARES THE LEAF COVERS 
THIS LEAF HAS AN AREA OF THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE SQUARE CENTIMETRES 
THAT SEEMS TO BE A FAIRLY REPRESENTATIVE SIZE 
WITH THIS INFORMATION 
SHE CAN ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF CARBON DIOXIDE ABSORBED 
AND THE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN GIVEN OFF FOR THE WHOLE CANOPY 
INDEED FOR THE WHOLE OF THE RAIN FOREST 
TREES ARE VITAL FOR OUR SURVIVAL AND BY USING THE DATA COLLECTED 
SCIENTISTS ARE ABLE TO ADVISE SCIENTISTS ON PLANTING SPECIES 
AND PLANNING FOREST DEVELOPMENT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY WON'T RUN OUT 
FOR PART A YOU'RE SHOWN A RECTANGLE EIGHTEEN C. M. LONG AND FOURTEEN C. M. WIDE 
SPLIT INTO FOUR SMALLER RECTANGLES 
YOU'RE ASKED TO FIND THE AREA OF EACH SMALLER RECTANGLE 
ONE HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE SO LOOK AT THAT FIRST 
NOW LOOK AT THE RECTANGLE ABOVE IT 
IT'S A SPECIAL RECTANGLE IT HAS A LENGTH OF TEN C. M. AND A WIDTH OF TEN C. M. 
SO IT'S A SQUARE 
LOOK AT THE RECTANGLE NEXT TO THAT 
REMEMBER THAT AREA MEASURES SPACE COVERED 
SO EACH OF THESE AREAS TELLS US THE SPACE COVERED BY EACH RECTANGLE 
TO FIND THE AREA OF THE LARGE RECTANGLE 
JUST ADD UP THE AREAS OF THE SMALLER RECTANGLES 
FINALLY YOU'RE ASKED WHAT EIGHTEEN X. FOURTEEN IS 
THE WHOLE LARGE RECTANGLE HAS LENGTH EIGHTEEN C. M. AND WIDTH FOURTEEN C. M. 
SO ITS AREA IS EIGHTEEN X. FOURTEEN 
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT ITS AREA IS TWO FIFTY TWO C. M. SQUARED 
THIS CIRCLE HAS A RADIUS OF FIFTEEN C. M. 
YOU NEED TO CALCULATE ITS AREA NOT FORGETTING TO SHOW YOUR WORKING 
WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU KNOW FIRST YOU KNOW THE RADIUS IS FIFTEEN C. M. 
THE FORMULA TO FIND THE AREA OF A CIRCLE IS 
YOUR CALCULATOR SHOULD GIVE 
USE THE APPROXIMATION THREE HUNDRED FOURTEEN FOR PI 
YOU NEED CM SQUARED PAPER TO DO THIS 
THIS IS A CUBE WITH WIDTH ONE C. M. HEIGHT ONE C. M. AND DEPTH ONE C. M. 
ANY CUBE OF DIMENSIONS ONE X. ONE X. ONE 
BE IT CENTIMETRES MILLIMETRES METRES OR KILOMETRES 
IS CALLED A UNIT CUBE 
THIS CUBOID IS MADE UP OF TWELVE OF THE CENTIMETRE CUBES 
IT'S VOLUME IS TWELVE CENTIMETRES CUBED WRITTEN AS CM WITH A SMALL THREE HERE 
THIS CUBE IS MADE UP OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE CENTIMETRE CUBES 
IN OTHER WORDS FINDING THE VOLUME CAN BE WORKED OUT BY COUNTING CUBES 
IMAGINE THESE CUBES ARE BLOCKS OF ICE 
THERE ARE FIVE LAYERS AND IN EACH LAYER THERE ARE TWENTY ROWS 
IF WE BREAK UP THE ROWS FURTHER 
WE CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE TEN CUBES IN EACH ROW 
IN ONE LAYER THERE ARE TWENTY ROWS OF TEN CUBES 
TOGETHER TWO HUNDRED CUBES OF ICE 
THERE ARE FIVE LAYERS OF TWO HUNDRED CUBES GIVING A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND CUBES OF ICE 
TO FIND THE VOLUME OF THIS CUBOID 
WE CAN COUNT THE NUMBER OF CENTIMETRE SQUARES 
ONE TWO THREE ANOTHER THREE ANOTHER THREE AND ANOTHER THREE 
THAT GIVES US TWELVE UNDERNEATH WE'VE GOT TWELVE MORE THERE 
TWELVE TWELVE EQUALS TWENTY FOUR 
THE VOLUME OF THIS CUBOID IS TWENTY FOUR C. M. CUBED 
AN EASIER WAY WOULD BE TO USE A FORMULA 
THE FORMULA FOR FINDING OUT THE VOLUME OF A CUBOID OR A CUBE IS 
LET'S USE THE FORMULA TO WORK OUT THE VOLUME AGAIN 
THE LENGTH IS FOUR ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
ONE TWO THREE 
ONE TWO 
FOUR X. THREE EQUALS TWELVE 
TWELVE X. TWO 
CAN YOU FIND A CUBOID THAT HAS A VOLUME OF ONE FORTY FOUR C. M. CUBED 
HOW MANY CAN YOU FIND 
USE YOUR CALCULATOR 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CLIP 
THIS IS THE LONDON AQUARIUM 
THREE FLOORS OF GIGANTIC FISH TANKS WITH WILDLIFE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD SHARKS JELLYFISH PIRANHA 
ALMOST EVERY TYPE OF FISH THAT YOU CAN'T GET AT THE CHIPPIE 
THE AQUARIUM HAS FORTY ONE TANKS CONTAINING THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DIFFERENT KINDS OF MARINE LIFE 
THAT MEANS A LOT OF WATER 
THE DESIGNERS HAD TO KNOW HOW MUCH 
ANY LIQUID HAS A WEIGHT AND A VOLUME THEY HAD TO BE SURE THE BUILDING COULD SUPPORT THE TANKS 
THEY FIRST HAD TO CALCULATE THE VOLUME 
HOW DO YOU WORK OUT HOW MUCH WATER YOU NEED TO FILL THIS TANK 
THIS IS A FAIRLY EASY CALCULATION FOR A REGULAR SHAPED CUBOID AS THIS 
WE WOULD MULTIPLY THE LENGTH OF THE TANK BY THE WIDTH OF THE TANK 
AND THE DEPTH OF THE TANK 
THAT WILL GIVE US THE VOLUME OF WATER IN THIS TANK 
FROM EXPERIENCE BRIAN USES SHORTCUTS TO ESTIMATE VOLUMES 
FOR EXAMPLE HE KNOWS THAT ONE METRE CUBED 
HOLDS ONE THOUSAND LITRES OF WATER 
BUT NOT ALL THE TANKS ARE CUBOID 
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF SHAPED TANKS 
BY DIVIDING THEM INTO SIMPLE SHAPES RECTANGLES AND TRIANGLES 
BRIAN COULD CALCULATE THEIR VOLUMES 
HE WORKED OUT THAT THE AQUARIUM HAS TWENTY FIVE MILLION LITRES OF WATER 
ENOUGH TO FILL TEN THOUSAND BATHS 
WITH THAT INFORMATION HE WORKED OUT HOW HEAVY THE WATER WAS 
HEAVIER THAN TWO HUNDRED BUSES 
THE ONLY WAY TO HOLD THAT WATER WAS TO BUILD THE TANKS 
DIRECTLY ONTO THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE BUILDING 
OR THE TANKS WOULD HAVE FALLEN THROUGH THE FLOOR 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME BEFORE YOU TRY TO HAVE A GO AT THOSE QUESTIONS 
LOOK AT THE FIRST CUBOID IT'S MADE FROM TWELVE SMALL CUBES 
YOU CAN SEE SIX CUBES ON THE TOP AND THERE ARE SIX ON THE BOTTOM TOO 
MAKING TWELVE CUBES ALL TOGETHER 
NOW LOOK AT PART A HOW MANY CUBES ARE THERE IN THIS CUBOID 
WE COUNT FIFTEEN CUBES ON THE TOP ROW 
THERE ARE ANOTHER FIFTEEN UNDERNEATH 
TRY TO IDENTIFY THE TWO CUBOIDS THERE IS ONE HERE 
AND ALSO THIS ONE HERE 
LOOK AT THIS CUBOID FIRST 
THIS IS MADE UP OF FOUR ON THE TOP AND FOUR UNDERNEATH 
NOW LOOK AT THE OTHER CUBOID 
THIS IS MADE UP OF FOUR CUBES ALONG HERE 
AND ANOTHER FOUR ALONGSIDE 
THAT'S EIGHT ON THE TOP ROW THEN EIGHT UNDERNEATH 
ADDING THE NUMBER OF CUBES IN BOTH CUBOIDS TOGETHER 
THAT'S IT FOR THE SECTION ON MEASURES 
IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND JUST GO BACK AND TAKE ANOTHER LOOK 
THIS SECTION IS ABOUT SPACE AND SHAPE 
DIFFERENT ANGLES HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES 
WHEN YOU EXERCISE IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU SEE 
WHETHER YOU'RE AN ACUTE ANGLE 
OR AN OBTUSE ANGLE 
WHO DOESN'T DREAM OF BEING ABLE TO BEND OVER BACKWARDS 
AND BECOME A REFLEX ANGLE 
WHATEVER YOUR ANGLE ON LIFE ROTATIONS IS THE CLUB FOR YOU 
BUT DON'T COME ALONG WITH AN INFLEXIBLE ATTITUDE 
WE'LL REALLY SET OUT TO STRETCH YOU 
IN THE UNDER NINETIES CLASS WE'LL HAVE YOU TOUCHING YOUR TOES 
AS YOU AIM FOR THAT DIFFICULT ACUTE POSITION 
IN THE OVER NINETIES BUT UNDER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTIES CLASS 
YOU'LL BE ENCOURAGED TO ROTATE YOURSELF INTO THE OBTUSE POSITION 
OR MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO TWIST YOUR ARM TO JOIN OUR OVER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTIES CLASS 
WHERE YOU CAN LEARN THE SECRETS OF REFLEX ANGLE OLOGY 
AFTER YOUR WORKOUT ROTATIONS HAS A LOT TO OFFER WHY NOT MAKE NEW FRIENDS 
YOU'RE A RIGHT ANGLE NOBODY WILL THINK YOU'RE SQUARE 
THERE'LL BE NO SHORTAGE OF THIRTY AND SIXTY DEGREE ANGLES 
WANTING TO GET TOGETHER WITH YOU IN OUR RIGHT ANGLE TRIANGLE CLUB 
ROTATIONS WHERE EVERY ANGLE FITS IN SOMEWHERE 
LET'S GO OVER OUR ANGLES YOU'LL KNOW THIS ONE 
LET'S LOOK AT HOW WE MEASURE ANGLES 
LET'S MEASURE THIS ACUTE ANGLE 
FIRST FIND THE LINE THAT SAYS ZERO ON YOUR PROTRACTOR OR ANGLE MEASURER 
PLACE THAT ON A LINE ON YOUR ANGLE LIKE SO 
MAKE SURE THAT IT IS STRAIGHT 
THEN YOU FOLLOW YOUR SCALE AROUND 
MAKE SURE YOU'RE READING THE CORRECT SCALE THE ONE ON THE INSIDE 
WE CAN SEE THAT THE ANGLE IS ABOUT FIFTY NINE DEGREES 
LET'S WRITE THAT IN 
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID IT'S AN ACUTE ANGLE 
WE KNOW THAT IT'S GOT TO BE NO MORE THAN NINETY DEGREES 
IF YOUR MEASUREMENT IS MORE YOU'VE GONE WRONG SOMEWHERE 
ALWAYS KNOW WHAT SORT OF ANGLE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 
WHEN YOU'RE MEASURING YOUR ANGLES IT'S O. K. TO BE ONE DEGREE MORE OR LESS THAN THE ACTUAL ANGLE 
YOU WILL STILL GET A MARK FOR THAT 
HOW ABOUT DRAWING ANGLES ACCURATELY 
I'M GOING TO DRAW AN OBTUSE ANGLE 
WHICH IS MORE THAN NINETY DEGREES BUT LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
I'M GOING TO MARK A POINT ON MY HORIZONTAL LINE 
ANYWHERE ON MY LINE 
THIS TELLS ME WHERE I SHOULD START MEASURING FROM 
WHERE I SHOULD PUT MY PROTRACTOR 
I PLACE THE CENTRE POINT OF MY PROTRACTOR WHERE I MADE THAT MARK 
MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PROTRACTOR IS STRAIGHT HOLD IT STILL 
I WANT TO DRAW AN ANGLE OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN DEGREES 
MAKE SURE YOU'RE READING THE CORRECT SCALE 
FOLLOW YOUR SCALE AROUND UNTIL YOU GET TO YOUR CHOSEN NUMBER 
ONE HUNDRED TEN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
I WANT MIDWAY I WANT ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
I FOLLOW THE SCALE AND I DRAW A LITTLE MARK THERE 
TO SHOW ME WHERE TO START DRAWING FROM 
I'M GOING TO JOIN UP THE TWO DOTS I MADE USING A RULER 
HOLD YOUR RULER STILL 
DRAW A STRAIGHT LINE JOINING THE TWO DOTS 
NOW HOPEFULLY THIS ANGLE HERE 
SHOULD MEASURE ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN DEGREES 
LET'S TEST THAT 
SO I PLACE MY PROTRACTOR ON THE CENTRE POINT 
MAKE SURE IT'S STRAIGHT HOLD IT STILL 
THEN FOLLOW THE SCALE AROUND 
ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED TEN 
MAKE SURE IT'S STRAIGHT THE WHOLE TIME 
HERE WE GO ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN MIDWAY 
SO I'VE NOW DRAWN AN ANGLE OF 
THIS WILL HELP ASSESS IF YOU'VE DRAWN OR MEASURED IT CORRECTLY 
YOU'LL LOSE MARKS FOR BEING MORE THAN ONE DEGREE OUT 
NOW FOR SOME MORE FACTS YOU NEED TO KNOW WHEN CALCULATING ANGLES 
A COMPLETE TURN MAKES A CIRCLE AND IS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES 
A HALF TURN MAKES A STRAIGHT LINE AND IS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
A QUARTER TURN MAKES A RIGHT ANGLE AND IS NINETY DEGREES 
HERE WE'VE GOT A RIGHT ANGLE MADE UP OF NINETY DEGREES 
WE HAVE TO FIND ANGLE A WE'VE ALREADY GOT THIRTY SEVEN DEGREES HERE 
THIS IS A COMPLEMENTARY ANGLE THIRTY SEVEN AND A MUST ADD UP TO NINETY DEGREES 
THAT EQUALS FIFTY THREE DEGREES SO 
LET'S MOVE ON TO A DIFFERENT ONE 
THIS TIME WE WANT TO FIND ANGLE B. 
THIS IS A CONJUGATE ANGLE 
THESE FIGURES HAVE TO ADD UP TO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES 
WE'VE ALREADY GOT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES WE NEED TO FIND B. SO 
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE 
WE'VE GOT A STRAIGHT LINE 
A STRAIGHT LINE ALWAYS ADDS UP TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
WE'VE ALREADY GOT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY DEGREES WE NEED TO FIND ANGLE C. 
LET'S LOOK AT VERTICALLY OPPOSITE ANGLES 
THEY ARE EQUAL THE SAME 
IF WE START WITH ANGLE A LOOK HERE SIXTY DEGREES 
THEREFORE ITS OPPOSITE ANGLE OF A MUST ALSO 
LET'S LOOK AT ANGLE B. IT'S VERTICALLY OPPOSITE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES 
TO CHECK THAT ANGLES ON A STRAIGHT LINE ADD UP TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
LET'S DO THAT QUICKLY 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIXTY EQUALS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
LET'S DO IT WITH THE OTHER ONE 
EQUALS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
AS WE ALREADY KNOW THE CORNERS OF A TRIANGLE ADD UP TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
IF I TOOK OUT THIS ANGLE THIS ANGLE AND THIS ANGLE 
THEY SHOULD ADD UP TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
LET'S PUT THEM ON A STRAIGHT LINE TO SEE IF THEY DO ADD UP TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
TAKE THE ANGLE PUT IT HERE THE OTHER ANGLE HERE AND THE THIRD ANGLE FROM THE TRIANGLE HERE 
YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY ALL ADD UP ON A STRAIGHT LINE TO GIVE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
THIS MEANS THAT THEY NEVER MEET LIKE A RAILWAY TRACK 
THEY'RE MARKED BY ARROWS ON THEM 
IF PARALLEL LINES ARE INTERSECTED BY A STRAIGHT LINE A TRANSVERSAL IT CREATES THE FOLLOWING ANGLES 
CORRESPONDING ANGLES MAKE AN F. SHAPE AND A RE E. Q. U. A L. 
A ONE AND A TWO ARE EQUAL 
B. ONE AND B. TWO ARE EQUAL 
ALTERNATE ANGLES MAKE A Z. SHAPE C. ONE AND C. TWO ARE EQUAL 
D. ONE AND D. TWO ARE EQUAL 
NOTICE THAT THE PICTURES HAVE A NOT TO SCALE NOTE 
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN DRAWN ACCURATELY SO YOU CAN'T MEASURE THE ANGLES 
IF IT SAYS CALCULATE DON'T MEASURE THE ANGLE 
YOU MUST WORK IT OUT USING ANGLE RULES 
HOW DID YOU GET ON 
WHEN YOU FIND ANGLES IN A PICTURE LOOK AT THE PICTURE AS A WHOLE 
THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICE IS THE TRIANGLE 
YOU KNOW THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES IN A TRIANGLE 
ALSO THERE ARE NO PARALLEL LINES 
YOU WON'T BE LOOKING FOR CORRESPONDING ALTERNATE OR INTERIOR ANGLES 
LOOK AT ANGLE A 
THERE IS AN ANGLE ON THE SAME STRAIGHT LINE WHICH IS EIGHTY DEGREES 
ANGLE B. ALSO LIES NEXT TO ANOTHER ANGLE ON A STRAIGHT LINE 
LOOK AT ANGLE C. IN THE PICTURE 
THERE IS NO ANGLE MARKED NEXT TO C. ON THE STRAIGHT LINE 
NOR DOES IT FORM PART OF A QUARTER OR COMPLETE TURN 
IF YOU FIND THIS ANGLE 
YOU'LL HAVE AN ANGLE NEXT TO C. ON A STRAIGHT LINE 
THIS ANGLE HERE IS INSIDE THE TRIANGLE 
THE ANGLES IN A TRIANGLE ADD UP TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
YOU KNOW THESE ANGLES EIGHTY AND FORTY DEGREES 
NOW C. AND THE SIXTY DEGREES ARE ANGLES ON A STRAIGHT LINE 
THEY ADD TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
LOOKING AT THE DIAGRAM AS WHOLE YOU SEE A RHOMBUS WITH AN EXTENDED SIDE 
YOU KNOW THAT RHOMBUSES HAVE TWO PAIRS OF EQUAL ANGLES 
AND TWO PAIRS OF EQUAL AND PARALLEL SIDES 
WE MAY BE LOOKING FOR CORRESPONDING ALTERNATE AND INTERIOR ANGLES 
YOU'RE ASKED TO FIND ANGLE D. 
YOU SEE THAT D. SITS IN A Z. SHAPE ALONG WITH THIS FIFTY DEGREES 
BETWEEN THESE TWO PARALLEL LINES 
AND SO THEY ARE EQUAL 
NOW THE FINAL ANGLE E. DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE IN A Z. SHAPE 
NOR IN AN F. SHAPE 
BUT E. DOES LIE BETWEEN THESE TWO PARALLEL LINES 
AND THESE TWO PARALLEL LINES 
HERE IT LIES BETWEEN THE PARALLEL LINES ALONG WITH ANGLE D. 
MAKING D. AND E. INTERIOR ANGLES 
D. E. EQUALS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES 
AS YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT D. IS FIFTY DEGREES 
WHEN A LINE INTERSECTS PARALLEL LINES 
YOU WILL SEE CORRESPONDING ALTERNATE AND INTERIOR ANGLES 
THIS SECTION LOOKS AT SYMMETRY INCLUDING CONGRUENCE AND TRANSLATION 
IT'S NOT HARD IT'S JUST A MATTER OF LEARNING AND USING THE RIGHT VOCABULARY 
A TWO DIMENSIONAL SHAPE HAS REFLECTIVE SYMMETRY 
IF A LINE CAN BE DRAWN SO THAT FOLDING PLACES ONE HALF 
EXACTLY OVER THE OTHER HALF 
OR PLACING A MIRROR ON THAT LINE DIVIDES THE SHAPE 
SO THAT HALF THE SHAPE WITH THE REFLECTION SHOWS THE WHOLE SHAPE 
THIS ISOSCELES TRIANGLE HAS ONE LINE OF SYMMETRY 
THIS RECTANGLE HAS TWO LINES OF SYMMETRY 
THIS REGULAR HEXAGON HAS SIX LINES OF SYMMETRY 
A SHAPE HAS ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY IF IT FITS EXACTLY ONTO ITSELF 
MORE THAN ONCE WHEN IT IS ROTATED THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES ABOUT ITS CENTRE 
ITS ORDER OF SYMMETRY IS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF TIMES IT FITS 
THIS ISOSCELES TRIANGLE HAS ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY ORDER ONE 
IT DOESN'T LOOK THE SAME UNTIL ITS IN ITS ORIGINAL PLACE FITTING ONCE 
THIS RECTANGLE HAS ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY ORDER TWO 
IT ROTATES AND LOOKS THE SAME HERE 
AND THEN BACK IN ITS ORIGINAL PLACE 
THIS REGULAR HEXAGON HAS ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY ORDER SIX 
IT LOOKS THE SAME AGAIN HERE 
HERE 
HERE HERE 
HERE AND THEN BACK IN ITS ORIGINAL PLACE FITTING SIX TIMES 
LET'S LOOK AT REAL LIFE EXAMPLES OF ROTATIONAL AND REFLECTIVE SYMMETRY 
THERE ARE PATTERNS OF SYMMETRY EVERYWHERE 
THIS TRAIN STATION IS ABSOLUTELY FULL OF THEM 
WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING SHAPES ARE SYMMETRICAL AND WHERE ARE THOSE LINES OF SYMMETRY 
WRONG ALTHOUGH THESE HANDSOME FEATURES SEEM SYMMETRICAL 
THEY ARE DIFFERENT LIKE EVERY FACE 
IF WE REFLECT GIDEON'S LEFT SIDE ONTO HIS RIGHT SIDE 
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS 
IF WE DO IT THE OTHER WAY ROUND IT LOOKS EVEN WORSE 
IF GIDEON WAS BALD HE'D STILL LOOK ODD 
ALTHOUGH SOMETHING MAY APPEAR SYMMETRICAL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO 
NOW CONGRUENT SHAPES 
A TWO DIMENSIONAL SHAPE IS CONGRUENT TO ANOTHER TWO DIMENSIONAL SHAPE 
IF THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME SHAPE AND SIZE 
TWO SHAPES CAN BE CONGRUENT IF THEY ARE THE SAME SHAPE AND SIZE 
AFTER THEY ARE ROTATED OR REFLECTED 
FOR INSTANCE THESE SHAPES ARE CONGRUENT TO EACH OTHER 
THEY ARE THE SAME SIZE AND SHAPE 
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE THAT ONE HAS BEEN ROTATED 
THESE RECTANGLES MAY LOOK CONGRUENT BUT LOOK CLOSER 
ONE HAS LONGER SIDES THAN THE OTHER 
FINALLY TWO DIMENSIONAL SHAPES ARE TRANSLATED IF THEY MOVE UP OR DOWN LEFT OR RIGHT 
REMAINING THE SAME SIZE AND SHAPE WITH NO ROTATION OR REFLECTION 
THE BEST WAY TO LOOK AT IT IS ON GRAPH PAPER 
LOOK AT THE TRIANGLES THAT ARE GOING TO BE DRAWN ON THIS GRAPH 
TO SEE WHICH ARE TRANSLATIONS OF TRIANGLE P. 
A TRANSLATION MUST HAVE THE SAME SHAPE SIZE AND ORIENTATION 
WHICH MEANS THAT IT STAYS THE SAME WAY UP 
LET'S BEGIN WITH TRIANGLE Q. 
IT'S THE SAME SHAPE AND SIZE AS TRIANGLE P. 
BUT IT'S ROTATED THROUGH NINETY DEGREES CLOCKWISE 
TRIANGLE Q. IS NOT A TRANSLATION OF TRIANGLE P. 
WHAT ABOUT TRIANGLE R. 
IT TOO IS THE SAME SIZE AND SHAPE AS TRIANGLE P. 
IT IS A REFLECTION OF P. IN THE LINE Y. EQUALS FOUR 
SO TRIANGLE R. IS NOT A TRANSLATION OF TRIANGLE P. EITHER 
WHAT ABOUT TRIANGLE S. 
IT'S THE SAME SHAPE AND SIZE AND ORIENTATION AS TRIANGLE P. 
SO IT IS A TRANSLATION 
TRIANGLE P. HAS BEEN TRANSLATED ONE SQUARE ACROSS RIGHT 
AND FOUR SQUARES DOWN TO MAKE TRIANGLE S. 
IF WE TAKE EACH CORNER ON TRIANGLE P. THIS HAS MOVED ONE ACROSS AND FOUR DOWN 
SO HAS THIS CORNER ONE ACROSS AND FOUR DOWN 
FINALLY THIS CORNER ONE ACROSS AND FOUR DOWN 
TRIANGLE T. IS AN ENLARGEMENT OF TRIANGLE P. 
SO IT CAN'T BE A TRANSLATION 
ON THIS GRAPH SHAPE G. HAS BEEN TRANSLATED TO SHAPE J. 
WE CAN SEE BY LOOKING AT EACH CORNER OF SHAPE G. 
THAT EACH ONE MOVES TWO SQUARES RIGHT AND FIVE SQUARES DOWN 
TO MAKE THE SAME CORNER OF SHAPE J. 
SUPPOSE WE WANT TO FIND OUT HOW TO TRANSLATE SHAPE G. TO SHAPE K. 
LET'S LOOK AT THIS CORNER ON SHAPE G. 
WHICH BECOMES THIS CORNER ON SHAPE K. 
WE MUST GO ONE TWO THREE SQUARES LEFT AND ONE SQUARE UP 
LET'S CHECK ON ANOTHER CORNER TO MAKE SURE WE ARE RIGHT 
LOOK AT THIS ONE ON SHAPE G. 
MOVE THREE SQUARES LEFT AND ONE SQUARE UP 
AND IT DOES TAKE US TO THE SAME CORNER ON SHAPE K. 
THAT'S THE BASIS OF SYMMETRY CONGRUENCE AND TRANSLATION 
YOU CAN USE A MIRROR AND TRACING PAPER TO DO QUESTIONS ON SYMMETRY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT PART A 
SHADE TWO RECTANGLES SO THE SHAPE HAS TWO LINES OF SYMMETRY 
LINES OF SYMMETRY HAVE TO CUT A SHAPE EXACTLY IN HALF 
SO WE NEED TO PLACE THE RECTANGLES EITHER SIDE OF THE LINE OF SYMMETRY 
THIS SHAPE HAS AT LEAST ONE LINE OF SYMMETRY BUT WE NEED TWO 
USING YOUR MIRROR CHECK THERE IS ANOTHER LINE OF SYMMETRY HORIZONTALLY 
YES THIS SHAPE DOES HAVE TWO LINES OF SYMMETRY 
YOU COULD ALSO HAVE CHOSEN TO SHADE THESE RECTANGLES 
PART B. ASKED YOU TO MAKE A SHAPE WITH JUST ONE LINE OF SYMMETRY 
GETTING ONLY ONE LINE IS MORE DIFFICULT 
LET'S TRY THE RECTANGLES EITHER SIDE OF THE HORIZONTAL LINE OF SYMMETRY 
THIS HAS ONLY ONE LINE OF SYMMETRY THERE IS NO VERTICAL LINE OF SYMMETRY 
THE LAST PART LOOKS AT ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY 
THE ORDER OF ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY IS THE NUMBER OF TIMES A SHAPE FITS ON ITSELF IN A TURN OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES 
THESE THREE SHAPES FIT ONTO THEMSELVES TWICE 
WHEN YOU ROTATE THEM THROUGH THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES 
CHECK THAT THEY FIT TWICE IN ONE TURN USING TRACING PAPER 
PUTTING A DOT ON THE CORNER HELPS YOU KEEP UP WITH THE TURNING 
TWO DIMENSIONAL SHAPES ARE ALL AROUND 
AS ARE THREE DIMENSIONAL SOLIDS 
TWO DIMENSIONAL SHAPES APPEAR FLAT ON A PIECE OF PAPER 
THREE DIMENSIONAL SOLIDS APPEAR TO RISE OUT OF A PIECE OF PAPER 
IT'S EASIER DRAWING A THREE DIMENSIONAL SOLID 
IF YOU USE ISOMETRIC PAPER THAT'S TRIANGULAR DOTTY PAPER 
THIS CEREAL BOX WHICH IS A CUBOID CAN BE DRAWN LIKE THIS 
THIS CHOCOLATE BAR A TRIANGULAR PRISM CAN BE DRAWN LIKE THIS 
WHEN DRAWING ANY SHAPE THAT'S SLIGHTLY TRICKY FIRST DRAW A BOX 
WHICH THE SHAPE COULD FIT INTO 
THIS HELPS GET THE SHAPE INTO PERSPECTIVE 
WHEN DRAWING THIS TRIANGULAR PRISM 
FIRST DRAW A CUBOID ROUGHLY THE SAME SIZE AS THE PRISM 
THIS HATBOX A HEXAGONAL PRISM CAN BE DRAWN LIKE THIS 
AGAIN DRAWING A CUBOID OF A SIMILAR SIZE 
HELPS TO GET THE HATBOX INTO PERSPECTIVE 
LET'S LOOK AT THE L. SHAPE TURNING FROM ITS BEGINNING POSITION 
WHERE IT LIES ON ITS THREE CUBE SIDE 
IMAGINE IT MOVING THROUGH A QUARTER TURN LIKE THIS 
NOW IT STANDS UP TO MAKE THE L. SHAPE THE RIGHT WAY UP 
IMAGINE IT MOVING THROUGH ANOTHER QUARTER TURN LIKE THIS 
NOW IT LIES ON ITS ONE CUBE SIDE 
IMAGINE IT MOVING THROUGH ANOTHER QUARTER TURN 
IT STANDS AS AN L. SHAPE UPSIDE DOWN LIKE THIS 
WHEN DRAWING ON ISOMETRIC OR TRIANGULAR DOTTY PAPER 
ALWAYS WORK OUT HOW YOUR SHAPE IS GOING TO SIT 
ALL CUBES LIE IN THIS DIAGONAL LINE 
SO YOU HAVE TO DRAW THE BASE OF THE CUBE ON THE SAME DIAGONAL LINE 
AS THE BASE OF THE CUBES IN ALL THE OTHER SHAPES 
THE CUBES ALSO LIE ON THESE DIAGONALS 
SO DRAW THE CUBE LYING ON THIS DIAGONAL TOO 
IMAGINE THE L. SHAPE UPSIDE DOWN 
YOU NEED TO DRAW THREE CUBES IN A COLUMN 
FINALLY THE SINGLE CUBE LIES ON THE SAME DIAGONAL 
TO THE LEFT OF THE COLUMN OF THREE CUBES 
LET'S LOOK AT MORE FACTS ABOUT THREE DIMENSIONAL SOLIDS 
SOME THREE DIMENSIONAL SOLIDS HAVE TWO DIMENSIONAL FACES 
THIS TRIANGULAR PRISM HAS TWO FACES THAT ARE TRIANGLES AND THREE THAT ARE RECTANGLES 
FROM THE FRONT THE FRONT ELEVATION WE SEE A TRIANGULAR FACE 
LOOKING AT IT FROM THE SIDE ELEVATION WE SEE A RECTANGULAR FACE 
FROM ABOVE WE SEE THE TOP ELEVATION 
A RECTANGULAR FACE WITH A LINE THROUGH THE CENTRE 
LET'S LOOK AT THIS HEXAGONAL PRISM 
IT HAS TWO HEXAGONAL FACES AND SIX RECTANGULAR FACES 
THE FRONT ELEVATION IS A RECTANGLE 
THE SIDE ELEVATION IS ALSO A RECTANGLE 
THE TOP ELEVATION IS A HEXAGON 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME 
AND REMEMBER TO USE A RULER AND A PENCIL TO DRAW ACCURATE DIAGRAMS 
WHEN YOU DRAW THREE D. SHAPES 
YOU CAN EITHER DRAW A THREE D. DRAWING ON ISOMETRIC PAPER OR A VIEW 
A VIEW ONLY SHOWS WHAT YOU CAN SEE FROM ABOVE SIDE OR FRONT 
THIS IS ALL ABOUT VIEWS FROM ABOVE 
IF YOU VIEW THIS SHAPE FROM ABOVE YOU SEE THREE CUBES IN A ROW 
THE MIDDLE CUBE OF THE T. SHAPE HAS TWO ON TOP 
SO YOU ONLY SEE ONE IN THE MIDDLE 
YOU CAN CHECK THIS BY MAKING A MODEL OF THE T. SHAPE WITH MODEL BRICKS 
THE THIRD SHAPE IS MADE OF FIVE CUBES 
FROM ABOVE IT MAKES AN INVERTED S. SHAPE 
THIS IS HOW IT LOOKS ON ISOMETRIC PAPER 
IF WE TAKE A DICE AND OPEN UP ALL THE SIDES TO MAKE A FLAT SURFACE 
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS 
NOTICE WHERE THE NUMBERS ARE POSITIONED ON THE NET 
TWO DIMENSIONAL SHAPES APPEAR FLAT ON A PIECE OF PAPER 
THREE DIMENSIONAL SOLIDS APPEAR TO RISE OUT OF A PIECE OF PAPER 
THREE DIMENSIONAL SOLIDS HAVE TWO DIMENSIONAL FACES 
THREE DIMENSIONAL SOLIDS HAVE DIFFERENT TWO DIMENSIONAL VIEWS 
WHEN SEEN FROM THE TOP FRONT OR SIDE 
KNOWN AS THE TOP FRONT OR SIDE ELEVATIONS 
TO MAKE A THREE DIMENSIONAL SOLID 
A TWO DIMENSIONAL SHAPE HAS TO BE DRAWN 
THESE SHAPES ARE CALLED NETS 
THE TOP AND THE BASE OF THIS BOX ARE SEMI CIRCLES 
HOW DID YOU GET ON 
AS THE BOX UNFOLDS YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS THE CORRECT NET 
TO BE SURE CHECK WHICH FACE WOULD GLUE TO WHICH OTHER SIDE 
IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BOX UP AGAIN 
THIS EDGE WOULD FIT ALONG THE CIRCUMFERENCE 
OF THE ARC OF THE SEMI CIRCLE 
AS WOULD THIS EDGE FIT ALONG THE ARC OF THIS SEMI CIRCLE 
THIS EDGE HERE WOULD FIT WITH THIS EDGE HERE 
EDGES ALWAYS MATCH WHEN MAKING A THREE DIMENSIONAL SOLID WITH A NET 
WELL THAT'S IT FOR SHAPE AND SPACE
