AT THIS STAGE WE'RE LOOKING FOR ONE FINALIST WHO'LL STAND UP WITH THE B. B. C. NATIONAL ORCHESTRA OF WALES 
IN THE MILLENNIUM CENTRE IN FRONT OF A HUGE AUDIENCE AND A TELEVISION AUDIENCE AND THEY NEED TO 
REALLY CAPTIVATE AND THEY NEED TO SELL THE PIECE THAT THEY'RE PLAYING 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THAT SPARK 
LAST NIGHT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD JADRAN DUNCUMB WON THE STRING CATEGORY

TONIGHT IT'S THE TURN OF THE BRASS PLAYERS TO SHOW THAT THEY'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES 
TO BE A WINNER AND WORTHY OF A PLACE IN THE GRAND FINAL THIS SUNDAY 
I CAN'T IMAGINE WINNING IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU'D GET 
WHEN I PERFORM AND I KNOW IT'S GOING WELL I JUST GET A BUZZ 
THE HAIRS ON MY NECK STICK UP AND I JUST LOVE IT 
YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN TO HANDLE THE PRESSURE AND FOR ME THAT'S WHAT YOUNG MUSICIAN IS ALL ABOUT 
I'M VERY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO SAY I GOT TO THE BRASS FINAL

ALEXANDER EDMUNDSON 
I'VE COME A LONG WAY AND I DON'T 
WANT TO LET IT WASTE AWAY I'M GOING TO ENJOY IT 
HENRY LINDSAY 
LISTENING TO WHAT THE JUDGES HAVE SAID 
I'VE REALLY PICKED UP THAT PLAYING MUSIC IS 
YOU'RE PLAYING TO THE AUDIENCE YOU'RE NOT 
PLAYING TO IMPRESS SOME HIGH PERSON UP THERE YOU'RE PLAYING TO MAKE EVERYONE HAVE A GOOD TIME 
MATTHEW WHITE 
I'VE BEEN TOLD ALL ALONG 
IN MY EDUCATION THAT I'M NEVER GOING TO MAKE A LIVING 
FROM PLAYING THE EUPHONIUM 
IT'S A REBELLIOUS SORT OF THING THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY GOAL 
LAST BUT NOT LEAST PETER MOORE 
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THE YOUNGEST COMPETITOR AT ALL 
I FEEL EQUAL TO THE REST OF THEM WE'RE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
THE FOUR WINNERS HAVE HAD TO COMPETE WITH TALENTED BRASS PLAYERS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
AND MAINTAIN THEIR PERFORMANCE OVER A SERIES OF TESTING ROUNDS 
THEY'LL HAVE SIX WEEKS TO PREPARE FOR THE CATEGORY FINAL 
TONIGHT'S ABOUT CELEBRATING 
AND GETTING USED TO THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT 
CHUFFED I FEEL BAD FOR THE PLAYERS WHO HAVE GONE OUT THEY'RE ALL FANTASTIC PLAYERS 
IT COULD BE ANY OF US REALLY 
IT'S PROBABLY THE HARDEST CONCERT I'VE EVER DONE 
I'M PLEASED THAT IT'S OVER I CAN'T WAIT TO BE BACK HERE IN A FEW MONTHS 
I WAS THINKING IT WON'T BE ME BUT IT WAS 
ECSTATIC REALLY PLEASED 
I'M SO HAPPY THAT ALL THE WORK I PUT IN PAID OFF 
LOCATED IN THE HEART OF MANCHESTER IS ONE OF THE U. K.'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS 
CHETHAM'S ALSO KNOWN AFFECTIONATELY AS CHET'S 
THREE OF OUR FINALISTS STUDY HERE 
MANY OF THE PUPILS ARE BOARDERS BUT EUPHONIUM FINALIST MATTHEW WHITE LIVES AT HOME WITH HIS FAMILY 
IN NEARBY BOLTON 
HIS SISTER VICKY IS ALSO AN EX CHETHAM'S PUPIL 
THE FACT THAT HE ENDED UP IN THE SCHOOL OWES SOMETHING TO THE YOUNG MUSICIAN COMPETITION 
WATCHING THE YOUNG MUSICIAN ON T. V. IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HALF THE PEOPLE WERE FROM CHETHAM'S 
HAVING DONE MORE RESEARCH MY PARENTS ASKED US IF WE THOUGHT WE WANTED TO AUDITION 
AND WE WERE SORT OF WELL WHY NOT 
WE DIDN'T EXPECT TO GET IN 
WHEN THEY WERE ACCEPTED AT CHETHAM'S 
I CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN 
THERE WAS A LOT OF SQUEALING AND DANCING AND THEY WERE SO EXCITED 
I LIKE BEING A MUM SO I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO BOARD 
SO THE WHOLE FAMILY MOVED FROM WINCHESTER TO BOLTON 
I ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY THE EUPHONIUM 
I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL MY FRONT TEETH HAD GROWN THROUGH 
BEFORE I COULD START OTHERWISE YOU CAN GET TEETH PROBLEMS 
THE SECOND THAT I HAD MY MAIN TEETH THROUGH AT THE FRONT 
I WANTED TO START SO MY DAD GAVE ME LESSONS 
I COULDN'T HOLD THE EUPHONIUM UP SO BUT THE SECOND I COULD I WANTED TO GET STARTED 
TO BE HONEST HE DIDN'T PUT THE INSTRUMENT DOWN BY CHRISTMAS HE WAS PLAYING ALL THE CAROLS 
OUT OF THE CAROL BOOK WE USED FOR OUR BRASS BANDS 
WE THOUGHT THAT WAS SOMETHING A BIT SPECIAL IN THREE WEEKS 
THE OTHER PERSON WILL COME OFF IN A MINUTE I'M REALLY NERVOUS 
THIS IS MATT'S SECOND TIME IN THE YOUNG MUSICIAN COMPETITION 
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN HE WAS FIFTEEN HE GOT TO THE BRASS SEMI FINAL 
I WAS CHUFFED TO GET THAT FAR BUT TWO YEARS LATER TO GO FURTHER 
AND BE ONE OF THE FOUR LAST BRASS PLAYERS IS AMAZING 
WHILE IT'S MATT'S SECOND TIME IN THE COMPETITION 
IT'S TROMBONIST PETER MOORE'S FIRST 
NOT VERY SURPRISING HE'S ONLY TWELVE 
HE'S ALSO A DAY PUPIL AT CHETHAM'S 
I CAME TO CHETHAM'S THREE YEARS AGO 
THIS IS MY THIRD YEAR 
IT WAS QUITE OVERWHELMING WHEN I GOT HERE JUST ALL THE THINGS HOW DIFFERENT IT IS TO OTHER SCHOOLS 
DESPITE HAVING EXCELLED AT THE TROMBONE FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE 
PETER WAS STILL SURPRISED WHEN HIS MOTHER ENCOURAGED HIM TO ENTER THE YOUNG MUSICIAN COMPETITION 
WHEN MUM SUGGESTED GOING IN FOR THE B. B. C. MUSICIAN I THOUGHT SHE WAS OFF HER ROCKER 
I THOUGHT I WOULDN'T BE ANYWHERE NEAR GOOD ENOUGH TO ENTER IT 
BUT SHE TALKED ME INTO IT 
I HAVE ENTERED LOCAL COMPETITIONS BEFORE BUT NOTHING AS BIG AS THIS 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO DO THAT 
HOW TO FINISH IT YEAH 
WE COULD EITHER JUST COUNT IT BUT THAT FEELS A BIT ARTIFICIAL 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
IS IT POSSIBLE TO DO THE TINIEST GESTURE 
WHERE YOU FINISH IT 
SHALL WE GO 
TODAY PETER IS REHEARSING WITH NICK OLIVER HIS ACCOMPANIST FOR THE FINAL 
NICK HASN'T BEEN SURPRISED BY HOW WELL PETER HAS DONE IN THE COMPETITION 
HE'S ONLY TWELVE BUT HE DOESN'T PLAY 
LIKE WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM A TWELVE YEAR OLD 
BOTH TECHNICALLY AND MUSICALLY 
HE'S WAY BEYOND HIS YEARS 
IN TERMS OF WHAT HE DOES AS A MUSICIAN 
I'M VERY EXCITED FIRSTLY TO GET TO THE CATEGORY FINALS YEAH 
I WAS SORT OF AIMING FOR THE THIRD ROUND 
BUT I WAS HOPEFUL 
MY BIGGEST FEAR IS PROBABLY JUST PLAYING TO PEOPLE REALLY 
AND NOT WANTING THEM TO THINK THAT I DON'T DESERVE TO BE HERE 
ALEX EDMUNDSON A FRENCH HORN PLAYER IS THE ONLY FULL TIME BOARDER 
OF THE THREE CHETHAM'S BOYS IN THE BRASS FINAL 
I'VE BEEN IN CHET'S SINCE I WAS NINE YEARS OLD 
I'M IN MY EIGHTH YEAR NOW 
IN ANOTHER YEAR I'LL HAVE BEEN THERE HAVE MY LIFE WHICH IS A BIT SCARY 
BUT I LOVE THE PLACE 
IT'S BRILLIANT 
MUSIC'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS LOVED SO WHY NOT GO TO SCHOOL WHERE YOU CAN DO IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 
BEING HAPPY IN SCHOOL IS IMPORTANT TO ALEX 
AS HE WAS BADLY BULLIED AND DEEPLY UNHAPPY IN HIS PRIMARY SCHOOL 
I HATED IT THE LAST YEAR I WAS AT MY OLD SCHOOL I MOSTLY JUST GOT SO TIRED AND STUFF 
AND ALL THAT STRESS WAS JUST HORRIBLE 
PLAYING THE HORN WAS MY HAPPINESS AND STILL IS OBVIOUSLY 
I REMEMBER I USED TO GO ON WEEKENDS FOR HORN LESSONS ON SATURDAYS 
THAT'D BE THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY WEEK AND THEN THE WEEK MONDAY TO FRIDAY 
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE THE MEZZO FORTE A BIT MORE LITERALLY FOR THE FIRST ENTRY THERE 
SO THAT YOU CAN DO THE PIANO ONE WITHOUT FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS 
ALEX IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON HIS YOUNG MUSICIAN PROGRAMME WITH HIS TEACHER LIZZIE DAVIES 
SHE'S BEEN TEACHING HIM SINCE BEFORE HE CAME TO CHETHAM'S 
I'VE REALLY GOT TO KNOW LIZZIE SHE'S ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS 
IF I'M UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING I CAN EASILY TALK TO LIZZIE 
JUST AS I COULD TO MY BROTHER OR SISTER OR MY PARENTS 
YEAH THAT'S A LOT BETTER 
LIZZIE NOTICED THE CHANGE IN ALEX'S PERSONALITY AS SOON AS HE STARTED AT THE SCHOOL 
HE BECAME SO MUCH MORE CHEERFUL 
HE'S THE LIFE AND SOUL OF THE PARTY 
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'VE GOT HORN ENSEMBLES 
HE'S BUSY CRACKING JOKES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
BUT ALWAYS DOING HIS BEST TO PLAY AS FANTASTICALLY AS HE CAN 
LIKE CHETHAMS THE PURCELL SCHOOL IN HERTFORDSHIRE 
IS ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST HIGHLY ACCLAIMED MUSIC SCHOOLS 
TUBA PLAYER HENRY LINDSAY THE ONLY BRASS FINALIST NOT FROM CHETHAMS 
HAS STUDIED HERE AS A FULL TIME BOARDER FOR FOUR YEARS 
TO GET INTO THE SCHOOL HENRY HAD TO PASS A SERIES OF TOUGH AUDITIONS 
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE LIKE YOU KNOW BILLY ELLIOT 
THAT ACADEMY SORT OF SCENE AND IT'S LIKE REALLY PRESSURED 
WHEN I CAME HERE I WAS FEELING LIKE HIM LITERALLY 
BUT FROM THE SECOND I JOINED IT WAS REALLY FAMILY ORIENTATED AND EVERYONE'S FRIENDLY 
COS ITS QUITE A SMALL SCHOOL AND ITS SO EASY TO FIT IN 
LIKE MANY YOUNG MUSICIAN FINALISTS HENRY FOUND A PASSION FOR HIS PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT AT A YOUNG AGE 
WHEN HE AND HIS FATHER WERE IN A BRASS BAND TOGETHER 
MY DAD WAS ASKED TO PLAY TUBA BECAUSE HE WAS BIG BIGGER THAN US ANYWAY I WAS ONLY EIGHT 
SO HE TOOK IT HOME AND I SAW IT THE NEXT MORNING AND I WAS LIKE 
I HAVE TO HAVE A GO ON THAT ITS SO COOL AND IT WAS BIG AND SHINY IT WAS AWESOME 
SO I STARTED PLAYING IT AND EVERYONE WAS SAYING I WAS BETTER THAN MY DAD AND HE WAS LIKE WELL YOU KNOW 
SO I TOOK THAT UP AND I DIDN'T REALLY STOP 
O. K. THANK YOU 
I'M NOW IN THE LOWER SIXTH SO I'M TAKING ENGLISH LIT MUSIC AND MUSIC TECH 
ARE YOU READY 
I REALLY COULDN'T IMAGINE BEING IN A NORMAL SCHOOL NOW 
BECAUSE I CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH MUSIC 
SO IF I WENT TO A GRAMMAR OR STATE SCHOOL WITH IT NOT BEING A BIG THING I'D FIND IT SO WEIRD 
BACK AT CHETS MATT IS PRACTISING WITH BRENDA BLEWITT WHO'LL BE HIS ACCOMPANIST FOR THE FINAL 
AND EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE OOP NORTH THERE'S A DISTINCTLY MEDITERRANEAN FEEL IN THE AIR 
A BIT OF THE GREEK DANCE SURE 
ITS ONE OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE JOB HERE 
THAT YOU START OFF WITH THESE LITTLE PEOPLE 
AND SORT OF RUDIMENTARY IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
AND THEN NURTURE THEM THROUGH THEIR DEVELOPMENT AS INSTRUMENTALISTS 
AND AS PEOPLE AS WELL COS YOU'RE SORT OF A FINE FIGURE OF A MAN NOW 
AS OPPOSED TO THIS LITTLE BOY THAT STARTED OFF SEVEN YEARS AGO 
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG YOU ALMOST DON'T APPRECIATE HOW MUCH HAVING A FULL TIME ACCOMPANIST HELPS 
IT'S SO NICE WE'VE BUILT UP A PARTNERSHIP AND WE KNOW EACH OTHER REALLY WELL 
SO ITS NICE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH AND WHAT TO EXPECT 
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE THE JUDGE ABOUT WHETHER IT'S SOUNDING EXCITING 
YOU'VE GOT TO TRUST THAT IT SOUNDS EXCITING AND NOT TRY AND MAKE IT EXCITING BY PUSHING IT TOO MUCH 
YEAH IT JUST GOT A BIT FRANTIC DIDN'T IT YEAH 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT MATT WHEN HE'S PERFORMING IS THAT HE REALLY GOES FOR IT 
HE GETS INTO THE SPIRIT OF IT AND HE'S GOT GREAT DETERMINATION HAVEN'T YOU I'D LIKE TO THINK 
THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT IS SOMETIMES AS WE JUST SAW WHEN WE WERE REHEARSING 
IT CAN GET CARRIED AWAY SOMETIMES AND WE HAVE TO TRY AND REIGN IT IN 
OUR YOUNGEST FINALIST PETER MIGHT'VE THOUGHT HIS MOTHER WAS MAD 
GETTING HIM TO ENTER THE YOUNG MUSICIAN COMPETITION 
BUT ACTUALLY HIS PARENTS DO KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT MUSIC 
THERE ARE FIVE OF US AND WE ALL PLAY BRASS INSTRUMENTS 
SO PETER GREW UP HEARING BRASS INSTRUMENTS AND PRESUMED THAT'S WHAT YOU DID 
WHEN HE FIRST STARTED NURSERY HE WOULD COME HOME AND ASK USUALLY HIS MOTHER 
WHAT DOES SUCH AND SUCH PLAY AND IT TOOK SOME EXPLAINING TO SAY NOT EVERYBODY PLAYS AN INSTRUMENT 
IT TOOK HIM A WHILE TO UNDERSTAND THAT 
EVEN BEFORE HE COULD SPEAK PROPERLY HIS PARENTS SUSPECTED HE MIGHT HAVE A BIT OF A MUSICAL TALENT 
EVEN BEFORE HE COULD SPEAK PROPERLY HIS PARENTS SUSPECTED HE MIGHT HAVE A BIT OF A MUSICAL TALENT 
DAVID WAS PLAYING MOON RIVER IN THE FRONT ROOM AND PETER WAS IN THE BACK ROOM IN HIS HIGH CHAIR 
AND DAVID STOPPED ONE NOTE BEFORE THE END AND PETER SANG HIS LAST NOTE 
HE COULDN'T TALK BUT HE SANG HIS LAST NOTE PERFECTLY IN PITCH AND WE THOUGHT OOH 
HE'S BEEN ENTERING COMPETITIONS REALLY AS LONG AS HE COULD PLAY 
HE USED TO DO LITTLE FESTIVALS WHEN WE LIVED IN BELFAST 
AND WHEN HE WAS SEVEN HE ENTERED THE N. I. PRIMARY SCHOOL MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
AND HE WON THAT PLAYING HIS BARITONE AND HE'S ENTERED THE BRITISH OPEN SOLO COMPETITION 
AND WON THE JUNIOR SECTION TWO YEARS RUNNING 
HE LIKES THE EDGE OF COMPETING HE LIKES HIS BAND TO DO WELL WHICH IT IS AT THE MOMENT 
IN NOTTINGHAM UNIVERSITY THE CREAM OF YOUNG MUSICAL TALENT 
THAT FORMS THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY STRONG NATIONAL YOUTH ORCHESTRA OF GREAT BRITAIN ARE REHEARSING FOR UPCOMING CONCERTS 
AMONGST THEM ARE TWO OF OUR BRASS FINALISTS 
ALEX FROM CHETHAMS AND HENRY FROM PURCELL 
TWO THREE 
IN THE NYO WE'LL REHEARSE FOR TWO WEEKS 
AND THEN AT THE END OF THAT WE DO TWO OR THREE CONCERTS' 
THIS COURSE WERE PLAYING IN GATESHEAD BIRMINGHAM SYMPHONY HALL AND BARBICAN IN LONDON 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
THE BOYS HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR THREE YEARS IN THE NYO 
AS WELL AS FRIENDSHIP THERE'S ALSO RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER'S ABILITIES 
IN TERMS OF THE YOUNG MUSICIAN COMPETITION PERFECT 
I THINK ALEX IS A GREAT PLAYER I MEAN WE HAD A REHEARSAL EARLIER AND HE HAD TO PLAY A SOLO BY STRAUSS 
AND IT WAS JUST LIKE AMAZING 
EVERYONE AROUND ME IT'S LIKE HE'S JUST BRILLIANT ISN'T HE WE'RE LIKE YEAH 
I REALLY WANT TO STAND UP AND JUST SHOUT MY HEAD OFF SOMETIMES 
BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T COS YOU'D GET IN TROUBLE BUT THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE'S THINKING 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY NOW 
WITH THE MORNING BRASS SESSION OVER IT'S TIME FOR A FULL ORCHESTRAL REHEARSAL 
ON THEIR CURRENT TOUR THEY'LL BE LED BY THE RENOWNED YOUNG RUSSIAN CONDUCTOR VASSILY PETRACHENKO 
PLAYING TUBA IN THE ORCHESTRA IS A GOOD FEELING 
COS WHEN YOU'RE NOT PLAYING YOU'RE LISTENING TO EVERYONE ELSE AND ENJOYING IT 
BUT THEN WHEN YOU COME IN BECAUSE YOU'VE WAITED SO LONG YOU MAKE SURE YOU NAIL IT 
THE REASON I THINK I WANTED TO PLAY THE FRENCH HORN WAS THE SOUND 
THAT'S THE THING THAT I LOVE ABOUT THE HORN THE NICE ROUNDED SOUND 
IT'S ALWAYS GREAT IF SOMEONE FROM MY SCHOOL GETS INTO THE FINALS AND I'M SURE ITS THE SAME FOR ALEX 
ITS GREAT AND ITS GOOD FOR THE SCHOOL BUT FOR ME PERSONALLY THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY RIVALRY 
I'M NOT REALLY THINKING OH I'M GONNA DESTROY HENRY BECAUSE HE'S FROM PURCELL AND I'M FROM CHET'S 
I JUST APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT HE ALSO ENJOYS MUSIC 
TO THE LEVEL THAT HE WANTS TO GET SOMEWHERE WHERE HE CAN DO IT EVERY DAY 
I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I'M IN THE SAME SITUATION 
BRASS PLAYERS DO RARELY WIN YOUNG MUSICIAN 
WHICH IS A BIT OF A BUMMER 
STRING PLAYERS HAVE HAD ALL THE GREAT COMPOSERS WRITING FOR THEM FOR YEARS 
BRASS INSTRUMENTS HAVEN'T WE DON'T HAVE A MENDELSSOHN TUBA CONCERTO 
ANY CONCERTO COMPETITION I'VE SEEN IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A VIOLINIST AND A PIANIST WINNING 
I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
ALTHOUGH ALL OF THE BOYS ARE BUSY WITH PREPARATION FOR THE YOUNG MUSICIAN COMPETITION 
THEY STILL HAVE TO KEEP TO THEIR OTHER MUSICAL COMMITMENTS 
BRASS MUSIC IS A STRONG TRADITION IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
AND MATT IS A MEMBER OF THE LEYLAND BAND 
I COME HERE TWICE A WEEK FOR REHEARSALS AND WE HAVE CONCERTS 
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IT'S GOOD FOR MY PLAYING BECAUSE THE BAND ARE FANTASTIC THEY'RE NICE PEOPLE 
I LEARN SO MUCH FROM THEM EVERY TIME I PLAY 
IT'S A TREMENDOUS WORKLOAD THAT MATTHEW UNDERTAKES 
THE COMMITMENT THAT EVERYBODY IN THIS BAND HAS TO PUT IN 
IS SUCH A COMMITMENT ANYWAY 
ON TOP OF THAT HE'S GOT HIS BURGEONING SOLO CAREER 
AND HE'S ALSO PUT PEN TO PAPER AND PRODUCED MANY A GOOD SCORE 
WE'RE REHEARSING FOR TWO SEPARATE THINGS 
ONE'S A CONCERT IN STROUD WE'RE DOING NEXT WEEKEND 
AND WE'VE ALSO GOT A BIG CONTEST WHERE ALL THE BANDS IN THE NORTH WEST 
WILL COMPETE FOR A CHANCE TO PLAY IN THE LONDON FINALS LATER THIS YEAR 
ONE OF THE BANDS THAT LEYLAND WILL BE COMPETING AGAINST IN THE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
ARE WINGATES AND THEY'VE ALSO GOT A TALENTED YOUNG MUSICIAN PLAYING FOR THEM 
SO AS WELL AS COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER INDIVIDUALLY IN THE YOUNG MUSICIAN 
MATT AND PETER WILL BE GOING HEAD TO HEAD WITH THEIR BANDS 
GOOD EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ARE YOU ALL WELL 
NEXT MONTH THE WINGATES BAND WILL BE GOING TO BLACKPOOL 
TO COMPETE IN THE AREA COMPETION 
AND THE TEST PIECE THIS YEAR WILL BE THE FESTIVAL MUSIC BY ERIC BALL 
BRASS MUSIC IS ALWAYS A FAMILY AFFAIR WITH PETER 
AND MUM JANE IS ALSO IN WINGATES 
WE LOVE IT DON'T WE WE DO IT'S REALLY GOOD FUN 
AND WE ENJOY PLAYING TOGETHER AND WE GET A BUZZ FROM PLAYING 
YOU CAN SEE HIS BIG SMILE HE'S BEEN PLAYING THIS HALF WE'VE BEEN TO CHICAGO HAVEN'T WE 
AND THE ISLE OF MAN AND FRANCE YEAH YEAH 
THIS NEXT PIECE IS PLAYED THIS EVENING BY A YOUNG GENTLEMAN 
WHO'S JUST IN FRONT OF ME PETER MOORE 
WHO IS AT THE RIPE OLD AGE OF IS IT TWELVE PETER TWELVE 
WILL BE VERY SHORTLY A FINALIST IN B. B. C.'S YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
I'M PLAYING AUTUMN DREAMS TONIGHT WHICH IS A SOLO BY LEO ZIMMERMAN 
AND ARRANGED BY ANDY BERRYMAN MY TEACHER 
TWELVE YEAR OLDS THEY'RE ALL THE SAME AREN'T THEY 
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO IT COS THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE WHO CAN PLAY SOLOS 
AND KNOWING I'M ONE OF THEM IT'S GOOD YEAH 
AS THE DATE OF THE YOUNG MUSICIAN COMPETITION DRAWS CLOSER 
AT PURCELL HENRY IS PLAYING AT AN EVENING RECITAL 
FOR ME IT'S A THING FOR PERFORMING COS I'M NOT ACTUALLY PLAYING THE MUSIC I WILL BE IN THE NEXT ROUND 
BUT I NEED THE CHANCE TO PERFORM IN FRONT OF PEOPLE COS I GET NERVOUS SOMETIMES 
SO EVERY PERFORMANCE I DO JUST HELPS REALLY 
GOOD EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WELCOME TO THIS EVENING'S RECITAL 
PERFORMING ALONGSIDE HENRY ARE OTHER PURCELL PUPILS 
WHO HAVE GOT THROUGH TO THEIR CATEGORY FINALS 
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING COMMUNICATING WITH THE AUDIENCE IT CAN BE SCARY IF YOU LOOK UP 
JUST TO EXPRESS YOURSELF AND YOU LOOK SOMEONE IN THE EYE IT CAN BE A HORRIBLE THING 
COS IT MIGHT BE SOMEONE THAT'S REALLY BORED OR SOMETHING AND IT'S LIKE OH THEY'RE BORED WITH MY PLAYING 
IT WOULD BE GREAT TO WIN AND I'D LOVE IT AND I'D LIKE TO SHOW PEOPLE 
THAT THE TUBA CAN BE A SOLOISTIC INSTRUMENT AND IT CAN BE JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS ALL THE OTHERS 
YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE IT BUT LET ME SHOW YOU 
IT'S THE LAST FRIDAY OF TERM AT CHETHAMS MATT'S GOING CLUBBING 
AND A COUPLE OF SIX FOOT SMURFS HAVE POPPED IN TO CALL FOR ALEX 
YOU'RE ALADDIN ARE YOU IS IT UNDERNEATH HERE AS WELL 
NO NOT PLANNING ON TAKING THESE OFF BUT HEY 
YOU STILL GONNA HAVE YOUR SOCKS ON WHERE DOES IT GO UP TO THERE 
WE HAVE A DISCO FANCY DRESS I'LL TAKE THIS OFF IT'S ANNOYING ME 
WE HAVE A DISCO AND YOU HAVE TO DRESS UP AS ANIMATED CHARACTERS 
I'M GOING AS ALADDIN BUT I DON'T HAVE A JASMINE TO GO WITH ME 
BUT ANDY AND JOHN ARE GOING AS TWO SMURFS 
SO I GUESS IN A WAY THEY'RE A COUPLE 
I DECIDED TO COME AS FRED FLINTSTONE 
I FOUND SOME MATERIAL THAT WOULD SORT OF WORK 
AND MANAGED TO DRAW SOME TRIANGLES ON AND STUFF 
SO IT PRETTY MUCH WORKS AND A BIG CLUB 
ALTHOUGH THEY'RE HAVING SOME WELL EARNED TIME OFF 
WHEN YOU'RE IN A MUSIC SCHOOL YOU'RE NEVER FAR AWAY FROM THE CLASSICS 
BY THE VILLAGE PEOPLE 
IT'S THE MORNING AFTER THE NIGHT BEFORE IN CHETHAMS AND THOUGH IT'S NOW HALF TERM 
THERE'S NO TIME FOR A LIE IN BECAUSE MATT AND ALEX ARE BUSY 
WITH THE SCHOOL'S BIG COURSE PROJECT MENDELLSSOHN'S ELIJAH 
WE'VE DONE FIVE HOURS SO FAR OF REHEARSING ON THE CHORAL SIDE 
AND THERE'S STILL TWENTY FOUR APPARENTLY TO GO SO THERE'S A HELL OF A LOT MORE WORK 
MUCH DONE BUT MUCH TO DO SITTING UP 
I'M HAVING TO SQUEEZE PRACTICE TIME AROUND THAT IN PREPARATION FOR B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN 
WHILE MATT IS REHEARSING WITH THE CHORUS ALEX IS BUSY PRACTISING WITH THE ORCHESTRA 
WE GET TO PLAY ON PERIOD INSTRUMENTS TO MAKE IT AUTHENTIC 
OBVIOUSLY IT'S A BAROQUE PIECE AND IT WASN'T WRITTEN FOR THE FRENCH HORN 
SO WE'RE DOING IT ON HAND HORNS AND IT'S GOOD FUN QUITE HARD BUT REALLY GOOD FUN 
THINK IT DOES GET QUITE PRESSURED AS THE COMPETITION COMES UP 
LAST WEEK WAS THE BUSIEST WEEK OF MY CHETS LIFE I'VE HAD FIVE CONCERTS IN FIVE DAYS 
WHICH IS PROBABLY THE WORST I'VE EVER HAD CRAZY BUT GOOD FUN 
AT HOME PETER IS GETTING TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THIS BROTHER DAVID 
WHO'LL BE TAKING HIM DOWN TO THE FINAL BEFORE THE REST OF THE FAMILY ARRIVE 
AND THE MUSIC COMPETITION IS NOT THE ONLY ONE ON THE CARDS 
I'M LOOKING FOWARD TO CARRYING ON OUR POOL TOURNAMENT HE WAS THRASHING ME 
SEVEN TO FOUR TO ME IN THE POOL TOURNAMENT 
I WAS LETTING HIM WIN JUST SO HE STAYED CALM 
WHEN DAVE WASN'T GETTING THRASHED AT POOL HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE PETER SOME PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK 
HE REHEARSED I WAS SAT IN THE AUDIENCE IT WAS GOOD TO GIVE HIM THE AUDIENCE'S PERSPECTIVE 
BEFORE HE DID IT THAT WAS HELPFUL NOT SO MUCH HIS PLAYING JUST REALLY OVERALL HOW IT COMES ACROSS 
WITH LESS THAN A WEEK TO GO BEFORE THE YOUNG MUSICIAN FINAL 
ALEX AND MATT ARE IN MANCHESTER CATHEDRAL FOR THEIR ELIJAH CONCERT 
WE PERFORMED ELIJAH YESTERDAY IN CHESTER CATHEDRAL 
AND WE'RE DOING TODAY'S CONCERT IN MANCHESTER CATHEDRAL AT SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY 
AND AFTER THAT GET TO GO HOME AND RELAX FOR A FEW DAYS 
BEFORE THE B. B. C. WHICH WILL BE NICE 
I'D LOVE TO BE PLAYING IN THE ORCHESTRA BUT MENDELLSSOHN DIDN'T WRITE ANY EUPHONIUM PARTS IN ELIJAH 
BUT IT'S A GREAT WORK TO BE A PART OF A FANTASTIC PIECE OF MUSIC IT'S A MEGA WORK REALLY 
LAST NIGHT WE DID MISS A FEW ENTRIES BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE WIND SO THAT'S ALL RIGHT 
AT HENRY'S HOUSE IN AMERSHAM HIS TUBA IS SOUNDING A BIT LESS TUNEFUL THAN NORMAL 
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S HAVING A BATH IN READINESS FOR THE COMPETITION 
WE'LL PROBABLY LET IT SOAK FOR HALF AN HOUR THEN COME BACK AND TURN IT ROUND 
I THINK THE FACT THAT HE'S GOT TO THE FINALS IS ABSOLUTELY SUPER 
AND OBVIOUSLY WE'D LOVE HIM TO GO ON AND GET INTO THE GRAND FINAL 
BUT TO HAVE GOT THIS FAR IS BRILLIANT ISN'T IT IT IS IT'S BRILLIANT 
RIGHT I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND THERE 
IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY TO REACH THE STANDARD DEMANDED BY THE YOUNG MUSICIAN COMPETITION 
BUT HENRY SUFFERS FROM WHAT COULD BE A DEBILITATING CONDITION FOR A BRASS PLAYER 
WHEN I WAS A TODDLER I STARTED GETTING ALLERGIES 
AND STARTED WHEEZING SO I WENT TO THE DOCTOR 
AND HE SAID YES YOU HAVE ASTHMA ALLERGIES ECZEMA 
SO THAT WAS A BIT ANNOYING BUT IT'S FINE 
HENRY WAS AT THE STAGE WHERE IF HE WENT ROUND TO A FRIENDS HOUSE 
HE WOULD HAVE AN ASTHMA ATTACK 
IF YOU WERE HERE AND SMELT OF PERFUME HE'D HAVE AN ATTACK 
IF WE WERE COOKING ANY OF HIS ALLERGENS IN THE KITCHEN 
MAKING PANCAKES HE WAS REALLY ILL ONE PANCAKE DAY 
BECAUSE HE WAS INHALING EGG AND MILK 
HENRY'S CONDITION WAS SO SEVERE THAT HE WAS REFERRED TO SPECIALISTS 
AT GREAT ORMOND STREET CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL 
IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET HIS ASTHMA TO A MANAGEABLE STAGE 
HE'S JUST ON A SOCKING DOSE NOW 
OF INHALED STEROIDS EVERYDAY 
I THINK THE TUBA HELPS THE ASTHMA NOT THE ASTHMA RUINING THE TUBA 
BECAUSE I'M A SIGNER AS WELL 
COS YOU HAVE TO HAVE LOTS OF AIR IN BOTH OF THEM 
AND DO LOTS OF EXERCISES WITH BREATHING AND THINGS 
I THINK THAT THEY HELP GET RID OF THE ASTHMA GENERALLY 
UNLESS I'M REALLY BAD AND HAVING AN ATTACK 
THAT WOULD RUIN THE PERFORMANCE 
I THINK IT'S BECOME A MOST MARVELLOUS FOCUS 
MUSIC OF HIS LIFE 
WHEN YOU'VE GOT CHRONIC DISABILITIES 
IT'S EASY TO CENTRE ON THOSE 
ACTUALLY HENRY PUTS THEM TO ONE SIDE 
WE WORRY ABOUT THOSE HE DOESN'T AT ALL 
HE GETS ON WITH IT HE WANTS TO BE THE BEST 
MUSICIAN OR THE BEST TUBA PLAYER HE'S PASSIONATE ABOUT MUSIC 
WHILE HENRY IS SPRUCING UP THE TUBA IN READINESS FOR THE COMPETITION 
ALEX IS SPRUCING UP HIS HAIR ALONG WITH HIS YOUNGER BROTHER TIM 
WHAT ARE WE DOING JUST THINNING IT OUT 
YEAH TRY AND KEEP IT LONG STILL TRYING TO GROW IT LONG 
EH I DUNNO YOU DON'T KNOW 
IS IT THE FINAL COMING UP YEAH 
THE BRASS FINAL'S COMING UP ON THURSDAY 
SO IT'S GETTING QUITE TENSE YEAH 
NAIL BITING 
FINALLY AFTER A FEW HECTIC FEW WEEKS 
ALEX GETS THE CHANCE TO RELAX AND CATCH UP WITH HIS PARENTS 
IT'S HELPFUL TO HAVE A FEW DAYS AT HOME 
SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE AND YOU CAN BE QUIET 
AND RELAXED BEFORE THE CONTEST 
RATHER THAN GOING STRAIGHT FROM BEING REALLY BUSY 
TO THE COMPETITION 
SO I'LL FEEL NICE AND FRESH WHEN I GO THERE 
TO SEE HOW MUCH ALEX HAS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE DESPITE HIS EARLY SCHOOL PROBLEMS 
MAKES HIS PARENTS FEEL JUSTIFIED IN HIM GOING AWAY 
AT A YOUNG AGE 
REALLY AS A PARENT YOU THINK 
WHAT ARE WE DOING SENDING THIS NINE YEAR OLD AWAY 
WHEN HE STRUGGLED TO COPE IN AN ORDINARY SCHOOL 
BUT IT WAS THE BEST DECISION WE EVER MADE 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO COME HOME AT WEEKENDS 
I DON'T GET HOMESICK MUCH 
AND I DON'T CALL THAT MUCH I DON'T THINK 
BUT THEN MUM AND DAD KNOW I'M HAPPY SO THE ONLY PROBLEM IS 
WHEN I DO CALL THEY THINK IT'S COS I'M UNHAPPY 
ALEX LIKE MATT HAS ENTERED THE YOUNG MUSICIAN COMPETITION BEFORE 
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX HE GOT THROUGH TO THE BRASS FINAL 
AS HE HAS THIS TIME ROUND 
I FEEL THIS TIME IN A WAY IT'S BEEN TOUGHER FOR HIM 
BECAUSE LAST TIME WE JUST DIDN'T EXPECT IT 
IN SOME WAYS IT'S A BIT OF A RELIEF 
THAT HE'S GOT TO THE SAME STAGE AS HE GOT TO BEFORE 
AS LONG AS HE'S HAPPY WITH HIS PERFORMANCE AND WHAT HE'S DOING 
THEN WE'RE HAPPY 
THE DAY OF THE BRASS FINAL HAS ARRIVED 
AND THE BOYS ARE BEING SHOWN AROUND 
WITH THE OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPHER IN TOW 
WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS JUST GET YOU TO CHAT HERE 
AS IF YOU KNOW AS IF WE'RE CHATTING TO THE AUDIENCE 
NO CHATTING TO EACH OTHER RIGHT 
THAT'S IT RELAX DON'T LOOK AT ME JUST CHILL OUT 
GET THAT ONE 
AFTER POSING FOR PICTURES IT'S TIME FOR FINAL REHEARSALS 
AND A CHANCE TO IRON OUT ANY LAST MINUTE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS 
DIDN'T BREAK AGAIN YOU'RE JOKING 
CAN'T PUT ANY MORE EFFORT IN THAN THAT 
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ER IT'S NOT EXACTLY SMASHING 
THE PLATE'S NOT ACTUALLY SMASHING 
IT'LL BE FINE HOW MANY PLATES WE GOT 
THERE'S LOADS LOADS LET'S DO IT AGAIN 
AS FAMILY AND FRIENDS GATHER THERE ARE LAST MINUTE HUGS 
AND ONE LAST GAME OF POOL 
BEFORE THE SERIOUS BUSINESS OF THE COMPETITION BEGINS 
WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE JUDGES 
DECIDING WHO WILL GO THROUGH TO THE GRAND FINAL TONIGHT 
ARE AWARD WINNING TRUMPETER ALISON BALSOM 
CONDUCTOR COMPOSER AND CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDGES BEN FOSTER 
AND RENOWNED HORN PLAYER JULIAN PLUMMER 
MATT IS THE FIRST TO FACE THEM 
THIS PIECE IS QUITE A MODERN PIECE BY NIGEL CLARKE 
CALLED CITY IN THE SEA 
IT'S A DESCRIPTIVE PIECE ABOUT THE VILLAGE OF DUNWICH SUFFOLK 
WHICH HAS OVER THE YEARS FALLEN INTO THE SEA 
THE PIECE REPRESENTS CHURCH BELLS UNDER THE WATER 
I THINK THERE'S SOME NUN CHANTING 
IT WAS A FANTASTIC OPENER TO THE PROGRAMME 
IT'S DESCRIBED AS LIKE A FOG HORN IT'S SUPPOSED TO SOUND AT THE START 
I THINK THE OPENING OF THE PIECE WAS REALLY WELL DONE 
HE'S A GENEROUS PERFORMER HE INVOLVES AND ENGAGES THE AUDIENCE 
VERY CONFIDENT OPENING GOOD USE OF DYNAMICS THROUGHOUT 
THE FIRST PIECE 
HE HAS A LOVELY SOUND 
BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE HE COULD VARY HIS VIBRATO MORE 
IT WAS A KIND OF STANDARD THING 
I WAS HOPING HE WOULD TAKE US SOMEWHERE DIFFERENT 
I THOUGHT IN THE PHRASING IT FELT A LITTLE DISJOINTED 
IT FELT AS THOUGH HE WAS TAKING EXTRA BREATHS 
WHEN HE DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO I THOUGHT HE COULD GO ON A LOT MORE 
WHEN HE PLAYED SOFTER OF COURSE HE WAS ABLE TO PLAY LONGER PHRASING 
THAT SUITED THE PIECE MUCH BETTER 
PARTICULARLY I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL 
THE WAY HE PLAYED IT 
EYE CONTACT'S A BIG THING IN THE PERFORMANCE 
BUT NOT PARTICULARLY AT ANYONE 
IT'S GOT TO JUST LOOK LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING 
GREAT TO CATCH THE EYE OF THE ADJUDICATOR OR WHATEVER 
ESPECIALLY ALISON BALSOM DON'T GET THAT ON 
I THOUGHT THE LAST PIECE WAS EXCITING ALTHOUGH I DID FEEL 
I WANTED TO BE TAKEN ON MORE OF A MUSICAL JOURNEY RATHER THAN JUST HEAR THESE FAST NOTES 
SURE WE WERE WAITING FOR THE PLATE SMASH AT THE END 
BUT IT'S A LOVELY PIECE 
IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE FIFTEEN MINUTES SEEMED I WAS ON AND OFF 
I ENJOYED IT LOADS IT WAS JUST GREAT 
MY MUM WAS AT THE BACK LIKE BASICALLY IN TEARS 
IT WAS GREAT AND YEAH 
I WAS REALLY KNOCKED OUT BY HIS PLAYING HIS TONE WAS GREAT 
AND VERY MUSICAL PERFORMANCES IN EACH OF THE THREE PIECES 
FOR ME FROM THE BEGINNING IT'S MAINLY BEEN ABOUT JUST THE PERFORMANCE EXPERIENCE 
GETTING TO PLAY LIKE FIFTEEN MINUTE PROGRAMMES AND STUFF 
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY 
IT'S LEADING UP TO WHAT IN MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER YOU WOULD DO MAYBE IN A SOLO RECITAL 
IT'S A NIGHTMARE WHEN YOU AIM FOR A TOP NOTE AND IT SPLITS 
HE DIDN'T GIVE UP YOU KNOW WHICH IS THE THING ABOUT BRASS PLAYING 
YOU REALLY HAVE TO GO FOR IT HE REALLY TOOK RISKS WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT TO PUT YOUR POINT ACROSS 
WITH THE SECOND PIECE I THOUGHT HE HAD A MUCH STRONGER UNDERSTANDING 
AND HE OBVIOUSLY ENJOYED IT MAYBE MORE THAN THE FIRST PIECE 
IT WAS A LOVELY PIECE THERE WERE MOMENTS OF BREATH TAKING CONTROL 
AND THE END WAS A BRAVE CHOICE 
IT'S AN ENCORE PIECE IT IS YEAH 
HE REALLY WENT FOR IT WHICH IS EXACTLY RIGHT 
IT'S A GOOD PROGRAMME A FEW MISHAPS PERHAPS 
I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT IT WAS GREAT PLAYING 
THERE WAS GOOD THINGS AND BAD THINGS YOU MISSED A FEW THINGS 
IT WAS MUSICALLY AS CONVINCING AS I'VE EVER HEARD YOU PLAY REALLY 
YOU GENERALLY KNOW THE SECOND YOU'RE OUT ON STAGE 
IF IT'S GOING TO BE A COMFORTABLE PERFORMANCE OR NOT COMFORTABLE 
LAST TIME WHEN I DID THE SEMIFINALS I LOVED IT 
I JUST HOPE IT'S THE SAME TONIGHT BUT YOU CAN FEEL REALLY EXPOSED 
HENRY WAS FOR ME ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE SEMIFINALS 
TONIGHT HE WAS WONDERFUL 
THE ARTICULATION WASN'T AS I REMEMBER LAST TIME 
VERY CLEAN AND PRECISE WHICH WITH THE TUBA OFTEN ISN'T THE CASE 
SUCH A GORGEOUS SOUND FIRST THING I WROTE DOWN 
BUT I NEEDED MORE CLARITY TO MAKE IT INTERESTING BASICALLY 
THAT ABSOLUTELY CAME IN THE SECOND PIECE 
WHAT ABOUT THE THOMAS GOLD JULIAN 
VERY IMPRESSIVE HE CAPTURED THE MOOD EXACTLY RIGHT REALLY GOOD 
AND DIDN'T HE ABSOLUTELY GO FOR IT VERY THEATRICAL HE'S SO CONFIDENT 
HE'S A REAL CHARACTER FOR THE TUBA TO SOUND SO AGILE AND HEROIC 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY STRONG RECITAL HE ENJOYED IT SO MUCH 
HE REALLY GOT INTO IT ESPECIALLY THE THOMAS GOLD 
AND I'D HAVE LOVED TO HEAR MORE YOU ALMOST NEED A LITTLE ENCORE 
A VERY STRONG PERFORMANCE BUT HE DIDN'T QUITE ACHIEVE 
THE HEIGHT OF HIS ABILITY WHICH IS A SHAME 
I WAS FEELING IT TOWARDS THE END 
I WAS STARTING TO LOSE CONCENTRATION BUT IT WENT REALLY WELL 
I WAS HAPPY WITH THE ATMOSPHERE AT THE END NO ONE WAS MOVING 
I MANAGED TO GET ACROSS WHAT I WANTED TO HOPEFULLY THEY ENJOYED IT 
I'M ABSOLUTELY KNACKERED NOW MY ARM IS DEAD FROM HOLDING THIS THING 
JUST RIGHT FROM THE START 
ABSOLUTELY 
WE ALL LISTENED TO ABOUT FOUR BARS 
AND WE ALL JUST SAT THERE AND WROTE SOMETHING VERY SHORT 
I WROTE OUTSTANDING WHAT DID YOU WRITE GREAT THROUGHOUT 
HE PLAYS THIS JAZZ STUFF VERY WELL WASN'T HIS PHRASING ON THE SLIGHT SWUNG QUAVERS SPOT ON 
SO SUBTLE 
TO HOLD THE TROMBONE SO CONFIDENTLY AND SO ASSUREDLY FOR THE WHOLE PERFORMANCE WAS JUST 
FOR A CHAP OF HIS AGE I DIDN'T SEE ANY NERVES AT ALL 
I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THAT I'D LIKE TO BE A TROMBONE PLAYER 
SINCE I WAS ABOUT FIVE TO BE HONEST 
YEAH 
BUT I STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT AS MAYBE A POSSIBLE CAREER ABOUT NINE ISH EIGHT ISH 
I THINK THE OUTSTANDING MOMENT OF PETER'S NIGHT WAS THE MIDDLE PIECE 
THE SANDSTROM PIECE THE SANG TIL LOTTA 
WHICH WAS I THINK WHERE WE ALL FELT THIS WAS SOMETHING 
IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL 
SOMETHING YOU DON'T HEAR EVERY DAY 
IT WAS JUST I SAID YOU SHOWED MATURITY WELL BEYOND YOUR YEARS 
I WAS JUST MESMERISED 
YOU HAD A TEAR 
YEP I HAVE TO ADMIT 
AND I LOVED THE FACT HE HAD A FOUR BAR REST 
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE SOMEONE HAD SAID REMEMBER YOU HAVE TO SMILE 
HE STOPPED PLAYING AND JUST WENT 
IN TERMS OF TONE QUALITY AND PROJECTION HE WAS UP THERE WITH 
I WOULD SAY WITH A PROFESSIONAL 
MY ONLY CONCERN WITH HIM IS LITERALLY 
THAT HE COULD WIN THE WHOLE COMPETITION AND HE'S SO YOUNG 
I'M HAPPY WITH HOW IT WENT 
I'M JUST RELIEVED REALLY TO GET IT OUT THE WAY 
I'M PLEASED WITH HOW I PLAYED YEAH 
CAN'T SAY MORE THAN THAT CAN YOU IT WAS GREAT 
REALLY GOOD MIDDLE PIECE ACTUALLY JUST LOVELY ABSOLUTELY LOVELY 
YOU HUNG ON TO EVERY PHRASE DIDN'T YOU IT WAS REALLY GOOD 
WITH THE PERFORMANCES OVER ALL EVERYONE CAN DO IS WAIT 
WHILE THE JUDGES COME TO THEIR DECISION 
MUM'S VERDICT IT WAS FANTASTIC YOU COULD TELL HE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT 
THAT'S THE MAIN THING ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
LOOK AT THIS ENJOYED 
I WAS NERVOUS FOR HIM BUT ONCE HE'D STARTED 
AND I KNEW HE WAS IN THE GROOVE AND HE WAS ENJOYING IT 
THEN I SETTLED DOWN AND ENJOYED IT AS WELL 
VERY NERVE WRACKING YOU KNOW 
ANY LITTLE FAULTS AND CRACKS AND YOU IMMEDIATELY FEEL 
JUST WAITING EXACTLY YEAH 
JUST HOPE THEY DON'T TAKE TOO LONG TO DECIDE 
IF THEY COULD DECIDE QUICKLY THAT WOULD BE MARVELLOUS 
IN THE JUDGING ROOM EVENTS HAVE MOVED ALONG

AND PETER WAS LAST WHICH WAS PROBABLY A GOOD THING 
IT WAS A PERFECT EVENING IT WAS LIKE GOING TO AN HOUR RECITAL 
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO HEAR IT

I THINK WITH PETER HE JUST BROUGHT SOMETHING EXTRA 
A REAL ENJOYMENT I WAS LOST IN HIS PERFORMANCE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH
