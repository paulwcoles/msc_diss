THIS IS THE STORY OF THOMAS TALLIS AND WILLIAM BYRD 
TWO MUSICIANS LIVING IN AN AGE OF UNCERTAINTY 
FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
IN ENGLAND WHERE ONLY ONE RELIGION WAS ALLOWED 
WHERE WORSHIP WAS COMPULSORY 
AND WHERE EVERY TIME A NEW MONARCH CAME TO THE THRONE 
THEY CHANGED THE NATIONAL FAITH 
TWO COMPOSERS IN AN AGE OF ADVERSITY FOR WHOM CHORAL MUSIC WAS THE PROFOUNDEST EXPRESSION 
OF DEEPLY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEFS 
THROUGH THE REIGNS OF SIX MONARCHS AND ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS UPHEAVAL 
SINGING THE LORD'S SONG IN A STRANGE LAND 
MY JOURNEY WILL TAKE ME FROM THE SOLEMNITY OF CATHEDRALS 
TO THE DESPAIR OF THE PLACE OF EXECUTION 
FROM THE PRIVATE CHAPEL OF HENRY THE EIGHTH AND ELIZABETH I 
TO THE HOLY MASS CELEBRATED IN SECRET DEEP IN THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
AS I DISCOVER HOW TWO ROMAN CATHOLIC MUSICIANS THOMAS TALLIS AND HIS YOUNGER COLLEAGUE WILLIAM BYRD 
SURVIVED AND FLOURISHED DURING THE TEMPESTUOUS FOUNDATION 
OF THE PROTESTANT CHURCH IN ENGLAND 
THERE ARE FEW DOCUMENTS FROM THOMAS TALLIS'S LONG LIFE 
NO BIRTH CERTIFICATE 
NO ACCOUNTS OF HIS PARENTS 
OR OF WHERE HE LEARNED TO WRITE AND TO SING 
IN A SENSE THE ONLY BIOGRAPHY IS THE MUSIC HE COMPOSED 
ONE OF THE FIRST FACTS WE CAN BE SURE OF 
IS THAT IN HIS EARLY TWENTIES HE WAS APPOINTED ORGANIST 
AT THIS SMALL AND RATHER UNDISTINGUISHED PRIORY IN DOVER 
HE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WAS ROMAN CATHOLIC 
GROWING UP AND LEARNING HIS MUSIC IN THE GREAT MEDIEVAL TRADITION 
OF PLAINCHANT AND POLYPHONY 
NOBILIS 
HUMILIS 
MAGNE 
MARTYR 
STABILIS 
HABILIS 
UTILIS 
COMES VENERABILIS 
BUT IN THE FIVE YEARS HE SPENT HERE BESIDE THE SEA 
HIS WORLD CHANGED 
OR RATHER HENRY THE EIGHTH CHANGED THE WORLD 
HENRY'S ACT OF SUPREMACY DECLARED THE KING TO BE THE ONLY SUPREME HEAD ON EARTH 
OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND 
HE BACKED THIS UP WITH HIS TREASONS ACT WHICH MADE IT HIGH TREASON AND THEREFORE PUNISHABLE BY DEATH 
TO REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS FACT 
OFFICIALLY ENGLAND WAS NO LONGER A ROMAN CATHOLIC COUNTRY 
THOMAS TALLIS WAS A GIFTED MUSICIAN AT A TIME WHEN VIRTUALLY THE ONLY OUTLET FOR HIS TALENTS 
WAS THROUGH THE CHURCH 
THE HUGE UPHEAVALS IN RELIGION AND SOCIETY OVER THE COMING DECADES 
ARE CENTRAL TO THE LIFE OF THIS MAN WHO WHATEVER HIS OWN PRIVATE FAITH 
WORKED DILIGENTLY AT THE BUSINESS OF MAKING SACRED MUSIC 
THESE ARE THE ORIGINAL MAIN GATES OF WALTHAM ABBEY 
WHEN TALLIS PASSED THROUGH THEM IN THE AUTUMN OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT 
TO TAKE UP HIS POST AS ORGANIST 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN WITH MIXED FEELINGS 
GLORIA IN EXCELSIS DEO 
AT THE TIME WALTHAM ABBEY WAS A MASSIVE ESTABLISHMENT 
THE CHURCH THE ONLY SUBSTANTIAL SURVIVING BUILDING WAS FOUR TIMES' ITS CURRENT SIZE 
MASS PUER NATUS BY TALLIS 
HARRY CHRISTOPHERS IS THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF THE SIXTEEN 
A CHOIR OF SPECIALIST EARLY MUSIC SINGERS 
HE CHOSE WALTHAM ABBEY AS THE SPACE IN WHICH TO RECORD THE MUSIC FOR THIS PROGRAMME 
BECAUSE OF ITS POWERFUL ASSOCIATION WITH TALLIS 
WHAT AMAZES ME ABOUT HIS MUSIC IS THE AMOUNT I AS A CONDUCTOR CAN INTERPRET 
I LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THE PUER NATUS MASS 
WHICH ON A PAGE LOOKS VERY CONFINED 
BUT ACTUALLY IT CAN TAKE A VAST AMOUNT OF INTERPRETATION 
FOR ME TALLIS IS FIRST AND FOREMOST A GREAT COMPOSER 
ONE OF THE FINEST AND I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY REMIND MYSELF 
THAT TALLIS WORKED FOR THE CHURCH 
THOSE WERE THE JOBS IN MUSIC IN THE TUDOR TIMES 
HOWEVER FOR THE PREVIOUS COUPLE OF YEARS SINCE HENRY THE EIGHTH'S BREAK WITH THE CHURCH OF ROME 
MONASTERIES PRIORIES AND ABBEYS HAD BEEN CLOSING DOWN LEFT RIGHT AND CENTRE 
PUER NATUS 
MONKS WERE FORCED TO DECLARE THAT THEIR WAY OF LIFE 
WAS A VAIN AND SUPERSTITIOUS ROUND OF DUMB CEREMONIES 
THEY WERE EVICTED THEIR LANDS WERE SEIZED CHAPELS AND CLOISTERS LEFT EMPTY OR DEMOLISHED 
ANY RESISTANCE WAS PUNISHED BY EXECUTION 
MASS PUER NATUS BY TALLIS 
BY NOW MONASTERIES WERE CLOSING AT A RATE OF TWENTY A MONTH 
THE NEW ORGANIST MUST HAVE BEEN WELL AWARE THAT WALTHAM ABBEY'S DAYS WERE NUMBERED 
IN FACT IT WAS LESS THAN TWO YEARS BEFORE THE ABBEY WAS FINALLY DISSOLVED 
AND THOMAS TALLIS WAS LOOKING FOR ANOTHER JOB 
ALTHOUGH DOCUMENTS RELATING TO TALLIS ARE RARE 
THERE ARE SOME AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE BRITISH LIBRARY IN SAINT PANCRAS 
HELD SOMETHING RATHER SPECIAL 
NICOLAS YOU'VE FOUND A BOOK 
FOR ME TO SEE 
AND I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT REALLY 
BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO DO WITH TALLIS YES SO SHOW ME 
IT'S WRITTEN BY A MAN CALLED JOHN WYLDE WHO'S WRITTEN HIS NAME AT THE FRONT 
SO THIS BOOK BELONGS TO JOHN WYLDE 
SOMETIME PRECENTOR AT THE MONASTERY OF THE HOLY CROSS IN WALTHAM 
SO HE'S FROM WALTHAM ABBEY WHICH IS WHERE TALLIS WORKED 
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN PART OF THE LIBRARY OF WALTHAM ABBEY 
AND IT'S GOT LOTS OF DIFFERENT MUSIC THEORY TREATISES IN IT 
INCLUDING AT ONE POINT A FEW PICTURES AS WELL THAT'S RATHER LOVELY 
SHOWING THE WAY THAT THE BREVE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO SEMIBREVES AND SO ON 
BEAUTIFUL AND THEN AT THE END OF IT IS TALLIS'S SIGNATURE 
HE'S WRITTEN THOMAS TALLIS YOU CAN IGNORE THAT BIT BECAUSE IT 
IT LOOKS MORE LIKE 
IT'S JUST THAT ONE AT THE TOP 
IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SIGNATURE 
IT'S QUITE SPIDERY BUT IT'S RATHER ELEGANT 
THIS IS THE ONLY EXAMPLE WE HAVE OF HIS HANDWRITING 
NO LETTERS SURVIVE CERTAINLY NO MUSIC YEAH 
THERE'S NO REASON TO DOUBT THAT IT IS TALLIS HIMSELF 
UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE STAMPED OVER IT 
NOT YOU PERSONALLY BUT YOU CAN STILL MAKE IT OUT 
OF COURSE TALLIS WAS AT WALTHAM ABBEY UNTIL ITS DISSOLUTION IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY 
SO I IMAGINE HE TOOK THIS BOOK AWAY WITH HIM 
WHEN THE ABBEY WAS DISSOLVED 
MAYBE THEY GAVE IT TO HIM BECAUSE THEY HAD NO FURTHER USE FOR IT 
WHEN YOU SAY THEY HAD NO FURTHER USE FOR IT 
DO YOU THINK THAT WHAT WAS IN THIS BOOK WAS SOMEHOW CATHOLIC AND THEREFORE OF NO USE 
OR JUST WELL IT'S CATHOLIC IN THE SENSE THAT ALL OF IT IS ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF PLAINCHANT 
THAT WAS CATHOLIC AND NOW ABOLISHED SO IT WAS NO USE TO ANYBODY 
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN TALLIS THE SINGER BECAME TALLIS THE COMPOSER 
THE BODY OF HIS WORK THAT HAS SURVIVED IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DATE 
BUT ALL DISPLAY HIS EAR FOR SUBTLE MELODY AND HIS GIFT FOR CLOSE HARMONY 
TALLIS'S MUSIC HAS THIS AMAZINGLY ETHEREAL QUALITY 
AND IN SOMETHING LIKE O. NATA LUX 
IT'S AN AMAZING GEM 
WITHIN THAT HE'S PRODUCED SOMETHING THAT HAS AN INCREDIBLE CELESTIAL QUALITY 
IT'S THE WAY TALLIS DISTRIBUTES THE VOICES IN A VERY SENSITIVE WAY 
EFFICI 
TUI BEATI CORPORIS 
HE DOES SET VERY MUCH ONE NOTE TO A SYLLABLE 
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A PART THAT HAS A LITTLE MELISMA A LITTLE MOVING LINE 
THAT ADDS A NUANCE TO IT 
THAT GIVES THE MUSIC A VERY TENDER APPROACH 
TUI 
BEATI 
CORPORIS 
FOR ME AS A CONDUCTOR THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT TALLIS'S MUSIC THAT ALL THE LINES ARE VERY SINGABLE 
THEY LIE VERY WELL FOR EACH VOICE 
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT OF EVERY COMPOSER OF THE TUDOR PERIOD 
O. LORD IN THEE IS ALL MY TRUST 
GIVE EAR UNTO MY WOEFUL CRIES 
REFUSE ME NOT THAT AM UNJUST 
BUT BOWING DOWN THY HEAV'NLY EYES 
BEHOLD 
TALLIS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS 
QUITE SIMPLY AN EMPLOYEE WHO LOOKED TO THE CHURCH 
TO PROVIDE HIM WITH WORK 
WHATEVER THE POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS CLIMATE 
HIS NEW JOB AS A PROFESSIONAL SINGER OR LAY CLERK WAS HERE IN CANTERBURY 
AT THE HEART OF A RELIGIOUS REVOLUTION 
LENDING HIS VOICE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW STYLE OF LITURGY FOR THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND 
NO NO NOT SO THY WILL IS BENT 
GONE WAS THE LATIN LANGUAGE AND THE ELABORATE ORNAMENTAL RITUAL ASSOCIATED WITH IT 
TO BE REPLACED BY PLAIN SIMPLE MUSIC WITH THE WORDS IN ENGLISH 
WHERE ANGELS SING CONTINUALLY 
TO THEE BE PRAISE WORLD WITHOUT END 
BUT HE DIDN'T STAY HERE FOR LONG 
HE'D LANDED A JOB FOR LIFE AS A MEMBER OF HIS MAJESTY'S PRIVATE CHAPEL CHOIR 
IF YE LOVE ME 
KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS 
AND I WILL PRAY THE FATHER 
AND HE SHALL 
I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IS THAT SINGING THE MUSIC FOR THE DAILY OFFICE 
AND COMPOSING THE MUSIC WERE NOT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THEY WERE THE SAME THING 
YOU WERE EMPLOYED TO MAKE MUSIC 
FOR THE DEVOTIONS OF THE CHAPEL ROYAL 
IN A MOST LITERAL WAY 
YOU'D WRITE IT TURN UP HAND IT OUT AND SING IT 
SO A LOT OF THE GENTLEMEN ARE PROVIDING MUSIC ON A WEEK IN WEEK OUT BASIS 
FOR THE CHAPEL TO SING 
HE MAY ABIDE WITH YOU FOR EVER 
CAN YOU TELL ME WHEN IT WAS BUILT 
THE ROOM ITSELF DATES FROM THE END OF THE FIFTEEN C. 
BUT IT WAS TURNED INTO A CHAPEL IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY BY HENRY THE EIGHTH 
WHEN HE APPROPRIATED THIS COMPLEX OF BUILDINGS FROM A LEPER HOSPITAL 
AND TURNED IT INTO A ROYAL PALACE AND THAT'S WHEN THIS ROOM BECAME A CHAPEL SO IN FACT 
THOMAS TALLIS WOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS ROOM 
CERTAINLY HE WOULD HAVE DONE 
THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT HERE THAT TALLIS WOULD RECOGNISE 
PRINCIPALLY THE CEILING WHICH WAS PAINTED PROBABLY BY HOLBEIN 
BUT CERTAINLY IN HONOUR OF HENRY'S FOURTH MARRIAGE IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY TO ANNE OF CLEVES 
NOT A SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE WELL NO I THINK THE CEILING WAS PROBABLY THE BEST THING THAT CAME PUT OF IT 
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE CHAPEL ROYAL IN ONE SENSE IS NOT REALLY A PLACE AT ALL 
IT'S A BODY OF PEOPLE PART OF THE MONARCH'S PERSONAL ENTOURAGE PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD 
AND IT'S A BODY OF CLERGY AND MUSICIANS THAT ATTENDS THE SPIRITUAL NEEDS OF THE SOVEREIGN 
WHEREVER THE SOVEREIGN HAPPENS TO BE 
THE KING WOULD MOVE AROUND AN AWFUL LOT PARTLY TO GO HUNTING 
AND PARTLY TO IMPRESS AND INTIMIDATE NOBLES IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
AND IN TALLIS'S TIME TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT HIS FIRST TITLE WOULD BE 
THE GENTLEMEN OF THE CHAPEL ROYAL OH RIGHT 
IT WAS ALL VERY MUCH ON ORDER OF SENIORITY 
YOU JOINED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST AND YOU MOVE UP THE LIST AS PEOPLE DIE 
STILL A YOUNG MAN 
SOMEWHERE IN HIS MID THIRTIES 
BUT HIS TALENT HAS THRUST HIM INTO THE HEART OF THE STATE 
SERVING FIRST HENRY THE EIGHTH AND THEN HIS SON EDWARD THE SIXTH 
AS THE NEW RELIGION FOUND ITS FEET 
BUT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PROTESTANT CHURCH IN ENGLAND 
WAS ABOUT TO COME TO A SUDDEN STOP 
AS HENRY'S ELDEST DAUGHTER MARY TUDOR TOOK THE THRONE 
SHE RE ESTABLISHED THE CATHOLIC FAITH AND PROMPTLY EXECUTING PROTESTANTS 
BLOODY MARY SENT ALMOST THREE HUNDRED MARTYRS TO THEIR DEATH DURING HER FIVE YEAR REIGN 
TALLIS AS A LOYAL MEMBER OF HER MAJESTY'S CHAPEL 
WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN HIS EMPLOYER'S POLICY 
OF RE IMPOSING THE CATHOLIC LITURGY 
MASS PUER NATUS BY TALLIS 
SHE ALSO FOUND A SUITABLE HUSBAND TO FATHER A CATHOLIC HEIR 
HERE AT WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL MARY MARRIED PHILIP OF SPAIN 
TALLIS AS A MEMBER OF HER MAJESTY'S CHOIR 
WAS AT THE CEREMONY 
THE MARRIAGE COULD HARDLY BE DESCRIBED AS A HAPPY ONE 
AND MARY DIED CHILDLESS 
UNDER THE TERMS OF HER FATHER HENRY THE EIGHTH'S WILL 
HER HALF SISTER TOOK THE THRONE 
THE NEW QUEEN ELIZABETH WAS DETERMINED THAT PROTESTANTISM SHOULD RETURN 
O. YE TENDER BABES 
OF ENGLAND 
CITIZENS NOW HAD EITHER TO CONVERT BACK TO THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND 
OR HOLD ONTO THE OLD FAITH IN SECRET 
CREATIVE ADAPTABLE AND IMMERSED IN THE ENGLISH CHORAL TRADITION 
TALLIS SEEMS TO HAVE MANAGED TO BALANCE HIS PRIVATE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS 
WITH THE DEMANDS MADE BY THE NEW ANGLICAN CHURCH 
NUMBER WHEREBY YOU MAY DO YOUR DUTY TO GOD 
MY GUESS IS THAT TALLIS WAS A ROMAN CATHOLIC AT HEART 
ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIS LIFE 
BUT LIKE ANY OTHER PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET YOURSELF SACKED BY SPEAKING OUT AND NOT TOEING THE LINE 
MAKE GLAD YOUR PARENTS 
TALLIS IS A VERY PRACTICAL COMPOSER HE DOES WHAT'S EXPECTED OF HIM 
HE'S A PURE PROFESSIONAL 
ANY PROFESSIONAL WOULD SAY THIS IS WHAT I DO IF THE RULES HAVE CHANGED I'LL CHANGE WITH THEM 
ELIZABETH WAS VERY KEEN TO PROMOTE A NEW FORM OF SINGING 
TO COMPLEMENT THE LITURGY 
FOR THE COMFORTING OF SUCH THAT DELIGHT IN MUSIC SHE SAID 
IT MAY BE PERMISSIBLE TO SING A HYMN OR SUCHLIKE SONG 
TO THE PRAISE OF ALMIGHTY GOD 
THIS HYMN TUNE COMPOSED BY TALLIS FOR A COLLECTION MADE BY THE FIRST ANGLICAN ARCHBISHOP MATTHEW PARKER 
MAY BE FAMILIAR 
ELIZABETH HAD ISSUED INJUNCTIONS FORBIDDING ELABORATE CHURCH MUSIC 
SHE REQUIRED A MODEST AND DISTINCT SONG WHICH MAY BE AS PLAINLY UNDERSTOOD 
AS IF IT WERE READ WITHOUT SINGING 
THIS OF COURSE DID NOT APPLY TO HER OWN CHURCH SERVICES 
ALTHOUGH TECHNICALLY SPEAKING THIS WAS A PLACE WHERE PROTESTANT WORSHIP WAS HELD 
IT WAS A PRIVATE HOUSEHOLD CHAPEL OF THE MONARCH NOT A PUBLIC SPACE 
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO VISITED IT WERE FOREIGNERS AND ROMAN CATHOLICS 
THE CHANCES ARE THAT WHAT WENT ON THERE WAS A BIT OF A COMPROMISE 
THE SERVICES COULD BE HELD IN LATIN THEY COULD THEREFORE INCLUDE QUITE A LOT OF LATIN TEXTS OF MUSIC 
I THINK IT WOULD BE WRONG TO THINK OF THE CHAPEL ROYAL AS BEING A PLACE WHERE STAUNCH ANGLICANISM 
IS BEING BASHED DOWN YOUR THROAT QUITE THE OPPOSITE I THINK 
ELIZABETH'S PRIVATE ATTITUDE WAS PERHAPS UNEXPECTEDLY TOLERANT 
THERE IS ONE JESUS CHRIST ONE FAITH THE REST IS DISPUTE ABOUT TRIFLES 
AND THEN WILLIAM BYRD A GIFTED YOUNG SINGER CHOIRMASTER 
ORGANIST AND COMPOSER 
WAS RECRUITED BY HER MAJESTY'S CHAPEL 
TALLIS AT THAT TIME WAS APPROACHING SEVENTY AND HAD ALREADY SERVED THE CHAPEL ROYAL FOR THIRTY YEARS 
BUT OVER THE NEXT DECADE HE AND BYRD WOULD WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER 
TO THE GREATER GLORY OF GOD AND OF COURSE OF QUEEN ELIZABETH 
ELIZABETH CLAIMED TO HAVE IN HER OWN WORDS 
AN AFFECTION FOR THE SCIENCE OF MUSIC 
IN RECOGNISING THAT SHE HAD THE COUNTRY'S TWO GREATEST COMPOSERS IN HER CHOIR 
SHE GAVE THEM A GIFT 
THE MONOPOLY FOR PRINTING MUSIC IN ENGLAND 
THE BUSINESS WASN'T EXACTLY A SUCCESS 
BUT THEY PUBLISHED ONE BOOK CANTIONES QUAE A. B. ARGUMENTO SACRAE VOCANTUR 
COMPOSED BY THOMII TALLISIO ET GUILIELMO BIRDO 
THEY COULDN'T FLATTER ELIZABETH ENOUGH 
THE BOOK IS DEDICATED TO THE MOST HIGH MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT EMPRESS 
THEY LAVISHED PRAISE UPON HER MUSICAL SKILLS 
COMPARED TO THE GREATEST MASTERS THEY SAID YOU EASILY SURPASS THEM 
WHETHER BY REFINEMENT OF VOICE OR AGILITY OF FINGERS 
AT THIS POINT QUEEN ELIZABETH HAD BEEN ON THE THRONE FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS 
TALLIS AND BYRD DECIDED NOT ONLY TO INCORPORATE THAT NUMBER INTO THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR BOOK 
THEIR THIRTY FOUR SONGS SEVENTEEN BY EACH COMPOSER BUT THEY ALSO DECIDED TO LET IT ECHO WITHIN THE SONGS THEMSELVES 
WITHIN THE HEART OF TALLIS'S EXTREMELY COMPLEX PIECE MISERERE NOSTRI DOMINE 
IS A SEVENTEEN NOTE MELODY 
MISERERE 
NOSTRI 
DOMINE 
MISERERE 
NOSTRI 
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY CHECK WHETHER THERE WERE SEVENTEEN 
SEVENTEEN NOTES TO EITHER A SYLLABLE OR A CHANGE OF NOTE 
AND THAT CAN ONLY WORK IF IT'S HAD SOME PRESUMABLY EMOTIONAL OR SPIRITUAL IMPACT 
THE AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS IS IT'S A TECHNICAL FEAT OF JUST AMAZING BRILLIANCE 
BUT LIKE ALL FEATS LIKE THIS IN THE HANDS OF SOME COMPOSERS 
THEY CAN JUST BE TECHNICAL ACADEMIC AND BORING 
BUT IN THE HANDS OF TALLIS IT'S THE MOST PHENOMENAL PIECE 
LET'S JUST HEAR THE FIRST FEW BARS 
MISERERE NOSTRI DOMINE BY TALLIS 
TALLIS MUST HAVE FELT AN AFFINITY FOR HIS JUNIOR COLLEAGUE 
PERHAPS HE SAW SOMETHING OF HIMSELF IN THIS TALENTED YOUNG PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN 
AND LIKE HIM WILLIAM BYRD SEEMS TO HAVE COME FROM HUMBLE ORIGINS 
THE FIRST SURE FACT WE HAVE ABOUT WILLIAM BYRD'S LIFE 
IS THAT IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF QUEEN ELIZABETH'S REIGN 
HE CAME HERE TO THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY IN LINCOLN 
TO TAKE UP HIS POST AS ORGANIST AND MASTER OF THE CHORISTERS 
CHRISTUS RESURGENS BY BYRD 
BYRD SPENT TEN YEARS IN LINCOLN 
HE LIVED HERE IN MINSTER YARD IN A HOUSE THAT'S NO LONGER STANDING 
HE MARRIED A LOCAL WOMAN JULIANA BIRLEY AT SAINT MARGARET'S IN THE CLOSE CHURCH 
WHICH WAS AROUND HERE ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN LONG SINCE DEMOLISHED 
THIS IS BYRD'S FIRST WORKPLACE 
THE CHOIR STALLS WHICH HAVE BARELY CHANGED OVER THE LAST FOUR HUNDRED YEARS 
I THINK WE CAN IMAGINE HIM HERE A YOUNG MAN GIFTED 
PERHAPS AMBITIOUS 
PRODUCING THE STREAMLINED MUSIC FOR THE ANGLICAN CHURCH 
ALL THE WHILE SURROUNDED BY THIS VERY ELEGANT BUT HEAVILY ORNAMENTED STONE AND WOODWORK 
A NAGGING REMINDER OF THE OLD FAITH 
LINCOLN CATHEDRAL HAS AN ARCHIVE OF DOCUMENTS THAT GOES BACK NEARLY ONE THOUSAND YEARS 
HERE WE HAVE THE OFFICIAL RECORD OF WILLIAM BYRD'S APPOINTMENT 
AS ORGANIST AND MASTER OF THE CHORISTERS HERE AT LINCOLN CATHEDRAL 
IT'S LIKE A MINUTE BOOK IT'S A RECORD OF THE MEETINGS OF THE DEAN AND CHAPTER 
THIS IS ALL IN A TYPICAL ELIZABETHAN SECRETARY HAND 
IT'S MOSTLY IN LATIN WHICH WAS THE GREAT LANGUAGE OF LEGAL RECORDS 
AND HERE WE HAVE THE OFFICIAL RECORD OF WILLIAM BYRD'S APPOINTMENT 
POINT HIM OUT FOR ME JUST FOR THE SHEER THRILL OF IT 
HERE WE HAVE TO ALL FAITHFUL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE 
KNOW THAT WE HAVE GRANTED THE OFFICE OF MASTER OF THE CHORISTERS 
TO OUR BELOVED IN CHRIST DELICTO NOBIS IN CHRISTO 
WILLALMO BYRD WILLIAM BYRD 
FOR THE TERM OF LIFE 
ONE OF THE FEW CHURCH ORGAN PIECES OF BYRD'S TO BE PRESERVED 
IS THIS AN IMPROVISATION ON THE STARTING NOTE THE CHOIR MASTER GIVES TO THE CHOIR 
AND ANOTHER ENTRY IN THE ACCOUNT BOOK UNCOVERS AN INTERESTING STORY 
SEPTEMBER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY BASICALLY THE CHAPTER IS INSISTING THAT IN SERVICES 
RATHER THAN PLAYING THE ORGAN HE WAS JUST TO GIVE THE STARTING NOTE FOR THE CHOIR 
AND THEN TO SING WITH THE CHOIR AND NOT TO PLAY THE ORGAN 
NOW THIS SUGGESTS TO ME THAT BYRD HAD BEEN EXPERIMENTING ON THE ORGAN 
AND THAT THE DEAN AND CHAPTER DIDN'T LIKE THIS 
IT WAS NOT SIMPLE ENOUGH 
IT WASN'T THE BASIC PURITAN SIMPLICITY THAT WAS WHAT THEY WANTED 
BUT IT WAS IN A LEDGER BOOK FOR ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN THAT WE FOUND SOMETHING 
THAT MADE ME PROFOUNDLY GRATEFUL FOR ELIZABETHAN BUREAUCRACY 
THERE WE ARE 
THIS PARTICULAR SECTION HERE DEALS WITH 
MISCELLANEOUS PAYMENTS MADE TO VARIOUS CATHEDRAL STAFF AND EMPLOYEES 
OVER HERE WE HAVE THIS AMAZING SIGNATURE WYLLYAM BYRDE 
OH WOW 
MASTER OF THE CHORISTERS OH WOW 
ACKNOWLEDGING NINE SHILLINGS FOR LIVERY 
WHICH WOULD BE FOR WHATEVER HE WAS REQUIRED TO WEAR DURING CATHEDRAL SERVICES 
THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY IT'S A VERY VERY VERY ELABORATE SIGNATURE 
I THINK WE GET SOME IMPRESSION FROM THAT OF THE WAY BYRD SAW HIMSELF 
HE WASN'T SHY AND RETIRING 
HE KNEW HE WAS A GREAT MUSICIAN AND I THINK THAT SAYS IT 
HOW THRILLING TO SEE IT 
YES IT'S A BEAUTY 
SEEING BYRD'S SIGNATURE GAVE ME A POWERFUL SENSE OF DIRECT CONNECTION WITH HIM 
BUT CAN MODERN TECHNIQUES OF HANDWRITING ANALYSIS 
PROVIDE A FURTHER INSIGHT INTO HIS PSYCHOLOGICAL MAKE UP 
THIS SIGNATURE OF WILLIAM BYRD'S 
APPEARS ON THE ACCOUNT BOOKS OF LINCOLN CATHEDRAL 
WHERE HE WORKED AS A YOUNG MAN IN HIS TWENTIES 
AS PULSATOR OF THE ORGANS 
I LOVE THAT PHRASE 
AND AS MASTER OF THE CHORISTERS 
AND YOU SEE IT LOOKS STIFF IT LOOKS FORMAL 
IT'S DECORATED WITH THESE FIGURE OF EIGHT PATTERNS 
WHICH ARE ABOUT THE IMAGE THAT HE'S TRYING TO CREATE 
SIGNATURE IS ABOUT YOUR PUBLIC IMAGE 
AND YOU SENSE FROM THIS 
THAT WILLIAM BYRD IS TRYING TO PROJECT AN IMAGE 
OF MAYBE BEING QUITE GRAND 
MAYBE HE'S TRYING TO GROW INTO THIS JOB THAT HE'S BEEN GIVEN AS A YOUNG MAN 
BUT AS HE FINISHES THESE FIGURE OF EIGHT PATTERNS 
HE DISPENSES WITH THE LAST LOOP VERY SWIFTLY 
AND I SENSE IN THIS A CERTAIN IMPATIENCE WITH THIS FORMALITY 
THAT ALTHOUGH HE'LL GO ALONG WITH IT 
REALLY THAT IS NOT WHAT IS ESSENTIAL TO HIM 
AND HE'S REALLY INTERESTED IN DEEPER MORE SPIRITUAL CONCERNS 
FIFTEEN MILES WEST OF CENTRAL LONDON 
AND SQUEEZED IN BETWEEN HEATHROW AIRPORT AND THE M. FOUR MOTORWAY 
LIES THE MIDDLESEX VILLAGE OF HARLINGTON 
AFTER LEAVING LINCOLN THIS IS WHERE BYRD AND HIS FAMILY SETTLED 
APPARENTLY TAKING POSSESSION OF HARLINGTON MANOR 
THE MANOR IS LONG GONE 
AND THERE'S NO REAL TRACE OF BYRD OR THE VILLAGE THAT HE KNEW HERE NOW 
AS EVER IT'S A FEW SURVIVING DOCUMENTS THAT GIVE US A CLUE 
THAT AT THIS POINT THERE ARE TWO OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE 
FIRSTLY THERE'S A PETITION TO HER MAJESTY 
WRITTEN JOINTLY BY TALLIS AND BYRD 
CURIOUSLY IT CONCERNS NEITHER MUSIC NOR RELIGION 
BUT PROPERTY 
PLEADING POVERTY THEY ASK HER MAJESTY TO GRANT THEM A BUNDLE OF LEASES 
FOR NEARLY A DOZEN PROPERTIES SCATTERED ACROSS SOUTHERN ENGLAND 
THESE WERE LANDS SEIZED AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERIES 
AND THEIR LEASES ENTITLED TALLIS AND BYRD TO VARIOUS RENTS AND TITHES 
SO OUR TWO COMPOSERS WERE LANDLORDS 
THE OTHER DOCUMENT FROM THE SAME YEAR IS PERHAPS MORE TELLING 
ON A LIST COMPILED BY THE RECENTLY ENTHRONED BISHOP OF LONDON 
OF THOSE WHO WERE GUILTY OF NOT ATTENDING CHURCH IN HIS DIOCESE 
IS THE ENTRY WIFE OF WILLIAM BYRD ONE OF THE GENTS OF HER MAJESTY'S CHAPEL 
THE FIRST EXPLICIT EVIDENCE OF THE FAMILY'S ROMAN CATHOLICISM 
BEING A CATHOLIC AT THIS TIME WAS A DANGEROUS GAME 
RECUSANCY WHICH MEANS REFUSAL 
WAS PUNISHED BY INCREASINGLY HARSH FINES 
TWENTY FOR NOT ATTENDING A PLACE OF COMMON PRAYER 
AND EVEN MORE FOR SINGING SAYING OR EVEN JUST HEARING MASS 
OVER THE YEARS BYRD AND HIS WIFE AND HIS SERVANTS 
WERE REPEATEDLY NAMED FOR REFUSING TO WORSHIP AT THIS CHURCH 
THE PUNISHMENTS NOT DETERRING THEM WHO KNOWS 
BYRD IT SEEMS WAS A STUBBORN STRONG MINDED INDIVIDUAL 
PERHAPS A SENSE OF PERSECUTION EVEN STRENGTHENED HIS FAITH 
THEN AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY 
TALLIS DIES 
THAT'S ALL WE KNOW 
BUT BYRD WAS MOVED TO WRITE AN EXTRAORDINARY ELEGY TO HIS OLD FRIEND 
THE IMAGERY IS PAGAN WE DON'T KNOW WHO WROTE THE WORDS 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN WILLIAM BYRD HIMSELF 
BUT THE SENTIMENTS ARE HEARTFELT 
YE SACRED MUSES RACE OF JOVE 
WHOM MUSIC'S LORE DELIGHTETH 
COME DOWN 
COME DOWN 
FROM CRYSTAL HEAV'NS ABOVE 
TALLIS WAS BURIED IN GREENWICH 
HIS GRAVE HAS DISAPPEARED 
BUT A FEW WORDS FROM HIS EPITAPH HAVE SURVIVED 
AS HE DID LIVE SO ALSO DID HE DIE 
IN MILD AND QUIET SORT O. HAPPY MAN 
TO GOD FULL OFT FOR MERCY DID HE CRY 
WHEREFORE HE LIVES LET DEATH DO WHAT IT CAN 
TALLIS IS DEAD 
TALLIS IS DEAD 
AND MUSIC DIES 
AND MUSIC DIES 
AND MUSIC DIES 
IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED TALLIS'S DEATH 
BYRD BEGAN TO PUBLISH REGULAR COLLECTIONS OF HIS VOCAL MUSIC 
SACRED AND SECULAR 
OR AS HE TERMED IT SOME OF GRAVITY OTHERS OF MIRTH 
FOR PLEASURE FOR PLEASURE FOR PLEASURE 
ALL FOR JOY FULL TIME FOR JOY FULL TIME 
FOR JOY FULL TIME 
DESIGNED TO BE USED IN PRIVATE MUSIC MAKING 
THE BOOKS WERE CAREFULLY DEDICATED 
TO PROMINENT AND INFLUENTIAL MEMBERS OF THE ELIZABETHAN ARISTOCRACY 
ONE SUCH FAMILY WERE THE PETERS OF INGATESTONE HALL 
FAITHFUL SERVANTS OF THE CROWN KEEN AMATEUR MUSICIANS 
AND RECUSANT CATHOLICS 
GOOD MORNING DO COME IN NICE TO MEET YOU 
THE PRESENT LORD PETER IS THE EIGHTEENTH HOLDER OF THE TITLE 
BYRD WAS A FRIEND OF BOTH THE FIRST LORD 
AND OF HIS FATHER THE TUDOR POLITICIAN WILLIAM PETER 
LET'S GO THROUGH THERE AND THEN ROUND TO YOUR RIGHT 
AND THAT'S A TUDOR PORTRAIT 
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S SIR WILLIAM WHO WAS JOHN THE FIRST LORD'S FATHER 
HE WAS THE ONE WHO REALLY FOUNDED THE FAMILY FORTUNES 
A CRUDE POLITICIAN 
HE WAS HE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE TO ALL FOUR TUDOR MONARCHS 
BUT STILL REMAINED A CATHOLIC OR AT LEAST THE HOUSEHOLD HERE WAS CATHOLIC 
HE JUST REGARDED HIS PUBLIC LIFE AS TOTALLY SEPARATE FROM HIS PRIVATE LIFE REALLY IN ESSENCE 
SIR WILLIAM BUILT THIS HOUSE ON LAND SURRENDERED BY THE CHURCH 
AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERIES 
HIS SON AND HEIR JOHN WAS ANOTHER ASTUTE POLITICIAN 
DEFIANTLY RETAINING HIS CATHOLICISM 
EVEN WHILST GIVING LOYAL SERVICE TO QUEEN AND COUNTRY 
HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY 
TO MOVE AGAINST CATHOLICS IN ORDER TO SORT OF 
IN A WAY SABOTAGE WHAT WAS GOING ON 
SO HE ACTUALLY PROSECUTED CATHOLICS OR 
WELL HE WAS THEY HAD A COMMISSION TO DISCOVER CATHOLICS 
IN WHICH HE WAS ONE OF THE JOINT CHAIRMEN 
AND ER THEY WEREN'T VERY GOOD AT IT 
VERY GOOD VERY GOOD 
AND THESE PORTRAITS HERE THAT'S HIM IN THAT PORTRAIT THERE 
A GOOD LOOKING CHAP 
IN THE WINTER OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE 
A SERVANT WAS SENT BY THE PETER FAMILY 
TO FETCH MR. BYRD DOWN FROM LONDON 
HE ARRIVED WITH A FEW FELLOW MUSICIANS 
AND SPENT THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY HERE IN PRIVATE CELEBRATION 
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CATHOLIC PRIEST IN ATTENDANCE 
WHICH IN EFFECT WOULD HAVE MADE THE WHOLE EVENT TREASONABLE 
THE FACT THAT IT WAS ILLEGAL TO CELEBRATE MASS 
DIDN'T DETER BYRD FROM PUBLISHING A TRIO OF FULL LATIN MASSES FOR THREE FOUR AND FIVE VOICES 
AND THESE REPRESENT A NEW PHASE IN BYRD'S CAREER 
LITURGICAL MUSIC WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY FOR PERFORMANCE IN SECRET 
THAT WAS LOVELY HARRY AND THE CHOIR IT'S LOVELY TO HEAR THE FOUR VOICES ISN'T IT 
AND HERE YOU GET THAT SENSE OF 
IT'S SO INTIMATE SOMETHING ILLICIT ACTUALLY YES 
IN THAT IT WAS A NEW SITUATION FOR A NEW COMPOSER YES 
I MEAN BYRD HERE HE'S WRITING IT IN PRIVATE 
AND SO THE THREE THE FOUR THE FIVE PART MASSES ARE INCREDIBLY INTIMATE PERSONAL 
STATEMENTS REALLY EVERYTHING'S VERY INDIVIDUAL HE'S STARTING WITH THIS BEAUTIFULLY SIMPLE LINE 
AGNUS DEI 
AGNUS DEI 
QUI TOLLIS PECCANTA 
QUI TOLLIS PECCANTA 
MUNDI 
MUNDI 
VERY SIMPLE AND THEN SUDDENLY HE WILL ALLOW THIS VERY EXPRESSIVE LINE TO COME FROM THE BASS LATER ON 
MISERERE NOBIS 
THAT'S QUITE ELABORATE INCREDIBLY ELABORATE 
AND THEN WHEN HE BRINGS THE FINAL DONA IN IT'S ONE OF TOTAL INTIMACY 
TOTAL PLAINTIVE NATURE 
DONA NOBIS 
DONA NOBIS 
NOBIS DONA NOBIS 
DONA NOBIS PACEM 
DONA NOBIS PACEM 
MIXED SINGLE VOICES 
YOU ARE LITERALLY PASSING ONE PHRASE AND ONE LINE VERY DELICATELY 
AND QUIETLY FROM VOICE TO VOICE 
IT WAS LOVELY TO DO IT THAT WAY 
AT INGATESTONE HALL AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT FOR THAT SETTING 
IT'S VERY STILL AND VERY QUIET IN THERE I THINK IT DEFINITELY MADE SENSE 
BYRD SINCERELY BELIEVED IN THE REDEMPTIVE POWER OF SINGING 
HE WROTE THAT SINCE IT IS SO GOOD A THING I WISH ALL MEN WOULD LEARN TO SING 
HE BELIEVED IT WAS EASILY TAUGHT AND QUICKLY LEARNT 
AND THAT THE BETTER THE VOICE 
THE BETTER IT IS TO THE HONOUR AND GLORY OF GOD 
BYRD'S COMPACT AND INTIMATE MASSES AND MOTETS 
THEIR CONCENTRATION OF EMOTIONAL ENERGY AND SUPERLATIVE TECHNICAL SKILL 
IS A PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION OF THAT PHILOSOPHY IN VERY TROUBLED TIMES 
MANY CATHOLICS SUFFERED GRUESOME DEATHS BECAUSE OF THEIR BELIEFS 
BYRD'S RESPONSE TO THE PUBLIC EXECUTION OF THE JESUIT PREACHER EDMUND CAMPION 
WAS THIS ELEGANTLY SUBVERSIVE SONG 
WHY DO I USE 
MY PAPER INK AND PEN 
AND CALM MY WITS 
FROM WHENCE THERE WAS TRUTH SAID 
THIS IS PART OF A TUNNEL THROUGH WHICH PRISONERS WERE TAKEN TO THEIR DEATH AT TYBURN 
THE PRESENT DAY MARBLE ARCH 
AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF DECEM RATIONES HIS TEN REASONS AGAINST THE ANGLICAN CHURCH 
EDMUND CAMPION WAS ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO THE TOWER 
THERE HE WAS TORTURED AND QUESTIONED 
A PROCESS IN WHICH QUEEN ELIZABETH HERSELF TOOK PART 
BUT HE WOULD NOT RENOUNCE HIS FAITH 
THE ONLY POSSIBLE OUTCOME WAS HIS EXECUTION OR IF YOU PREFER IT HIS MARTYRDOM 
INTRIGUED BY THIS SOPHISTICATED MUSICAL EXPRESSION OF DESPAIR AND ANGER 
I WENT TO KING'S COLLEGE LONDON 
TO CONSULT DAVID TRENDELL 
AN AUTHORITY ON THE STYLISTIC INTERPRETATION AND PERFORMANCE PRACTICE OF ENGLISH CHURCH MUSIC 
IT'S QUITE SOBER QUITE MELANCHOLIC 
ABSOLUTELY YES 
IT VERY MUCH REFLECTS THE ALMOST HELPLESS NOTE 
AND CALL MY WITS TO COUNSEL 
IT REFLECTS THAT 
THIS VERY MELANCHOLIC SLOW MOVING IDEA 
WHY DO I USE 
THAT CIRCULAR THEME COMING BACK 
AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS FALLING FIGURE MELANCHOLIC FIGURE 
IT'S PRE ECHOED IN THE INSTRUMENTAL PART 
AND CALL MY WITS TO COUNSEL 
THAT'S LOVELY 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
WHEN IT GETS TO THE WORD AN ANGEL'S TRUMP TRUMPET 
YOU GET ALMOST A FANFARE TYPE OF FIGURE IN THE TOP VOICE 
AN ANGEL'S TRUMP 
THE REALLY INTERESTING THING IS AT THE END 
IT'S VERY DISSONANT 
WE HAVE THIS NOTE SUSPENDED OVER IN ONE OF THE MIDDLE VOICES 
IF I JUST PLAY THE LAST LITTLE BIT 
EARTH WERE FOUND 
I LOVE THAT 
WHICH YOU DON'T FIND ANYWHERE ELSE AND VERY RARELY IN ANYBODY ELSE'S MUSIC 
BUT BYRD IS VERY EXPRESSIVE HE USES IT AS AN EMOTIONAL TOOL YES 
IT SHOULDN'T WORK BUT IT DOES BEAUTIFUL 
THE TOWER SAYETH THE TRUTH HE DID DEFEND 
THE BAR BEARS WITNESS OF HIS GUILTLESS MIND 
TYBURN DOTH TELL HE MADE A PATIENT END 
ON EVERY GATE HIS MARTYRDOM WE FIND 
CLEARLY WHATEVER PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF PROTESTANT FAITH WAS REQUIRED 
BY HIS BEING A MEMBER OF THE CHAPEL ROYAL CONCEALED SOME DEEP AND INTENSELY PRIVATE BELIEFS 
THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO EXPLORE 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY THREE THE PLAGUE SWEPT THROUGH LONDON CLAIMING TEN THOUSAND LIVES 
IN SIX MONTHS 
BYRD AND HIS WIFE LEFT THE CITY AND CAME TO THE VILLAGE OF STONDON MASSEY IN ESSEX 
CLOSE TO THE PETER FAMILY AND CLOSE ENOUGH TO LONDON THAT BYRD COULD KEEP UP HIS ASSOCIATION 
WITH THE CHAPEL ROYAL 
IT WAS HERE THAT HE WAS TO SPEND THE LAST THIRTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE 
HE TOOK OUT A VERY LONG LEASE ON THIS PROPERTY THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL BUILDING 
WHICH WAS DEMOLISHED IN THE EARLY EIGHTEEN C. TO BE REPLACED BY A HOUSE THAT BURNED DOWN IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTIES 
THIS BUILDING IS LATE VICTORIAN 
BYRD QUICKLY BECAME ENTANGLED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL DISPUTES WITH HIS NEIGHBOURS 
PARTICULARLY WITH MRS. SHELLEY 
WHO CLAIMED THE FREEHOLD OF HIS HOUSE AND WITH WHOM HE CONDUCTED A TWENTY YEAR FEUD 
SHE ACCUSES HIM OF VILE AND BITTER WORDS 
AND INSISTED HE CLAIMED THAT IF HE COULD NOT HOLD ONTO THE PROPERTY BY RIGHT 
HE WOULD HOLD ONTO IT MY MIGHT 
PERHAPS ONE OF THE REASONS HE FOUGHT SO HARD TO RETAIN THE HOUSE 
WAS THAT IT WAS IDEAL FOR A SECRETIVE ROMAN CATHOLIC 
WE KNOW THAT AT THIS TIME THERE WAS A CONCEALED FOOTPATH THAT LED OVER THE FIELDS TO NEARBY KELVEDON 
A NOTORIOUS CENTRE FOR RECUSANCY 
WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE INEVITABLY THERE WAS A LEGAL DISPUTE OVER IT 
SHADED BY THE WOODLAND 
IT WOULD HAVE MADE A CLANDESTINE ROUTE FOR BYRD AND HIS FAMILY TO VISIT 
THEIR CATHOLIC FRIENDS THERE SAFE FROM THE EYES OF PRYING ANGLICAN NEIGHBOURS 
THIS WAS AN AGE OF CODED MESSAGES OF HIDDEN SECRET MEANINGS 
WHEN THE ITALIAN COMPOSER PHILIP DEMONTE WHO WAS WORKING FOR THE KING OF SPAIN 
SENT BYRD HIS ARRANGEMENT OF PSALM ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX 
BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON 
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN AS MERELY ONE COMPOSER ASKING HIS REVERED ENGLISH COLLEAGUE 
TO ADMIRE THE EXQUISITE EIGHT PART WRITING 
SUPER FLUMINA 
BABYLONIS ILLIC 
SEDIMUS ET FLEVIMUS 
AND EXQUISITE IT CERTAINLY IS 
BYRD FELT COMPELLED TO REPLY WITH HIS OWN VERSION OF THE PSALM 
ALTHOUGH HE STARTED IT WITH DIFFERENT WORDS 
HOW SHALL WE SING THE LORD'S SONG IN A STRANGE LAND 
QUOMODO CANTABIMUS 
AND SO HERE IT SEEMED WERE TWO COMPOSERS INNOCENTLY SHARING THEIR DELIGHT IN SETTING BIBLICAL TEXTS 
BUT DE MONTE WAS A CATHOLIC SAFE IN A COUNTRY THAT STILL OWED ALLEGIANCE TO THE POPE 
BYRD HAD TO HIDE HIS CATHOLICISM 
IN A COUNTRY THAT HAD EXILED ITSELF FROM THE CHURCH IN ROME 
SO THEIR EXCHANGE HAD A DEEPER POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE 
AND BYRD WAS TO ADD A TOUCH OF DEFIANCE TO HIS SETTING OF THE PSALM 
HE WOULD NOT FORGET ROME 
IF I FORGET THEE LET MY RIGHT HAND FORGET HER CUNNING 
IF I DO NOT REMEMBER THEE LET MY TONGUE CLEAVE TO THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH 
WHEN JAMES I OF ENGLAND AND THE SIXTH OF SCOTLAND 
SUCCEEDED ELIZABETH HE RAMPED UP THE PENALTIES AGAINST CATHOLICS 
HIS ACT FOR THE BETTER DISCOVERING AND REPRESSING OF POPISH RECUSANTS 
CONTAINED MEASURES FOR THE SEIZURE OF LAND 
AND IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS ON WHERE CATHOLICS MIGHT LIVE 
AND THEIR FREEDOM TO TRAVEL MORE THAN FIVE MILES FROM HOME 
BYRD'S RESPONSE TO THIS WAS TO CONTINUE HIS PROJECT FOR SECRET CATHOLIC MUSIC 
HE COMPILED A COLLECTION OF ONE HUNDRED NINE COMPOSITIONS WHICH BECAME KNOWN AS THE GRADUALIA 
MUSIC FOR THE WHOLE CYCLE OF THE CHURCH'S YEAR 
INCLUDING FEAST DAYS AND SAINTS' DAYS 
GLORIOUS MUSIC BUT ON AN ALMOST DOMESTIC SCALE 
ANIMAE IN MANU DEI SUNT 
ET NON TANGET ILLOS 
IN THE WORDS THEMSELVES AS I'VE LEARNT FROM EXPERIENCE 
THERE IS SUCH HIDDEN AND MYSTERIOUS POWER 
THAT TO A PERSON THINKING OVER DIVINE THINGS 
DILIGENTLY AND EARNESTLY TURNING THEM OVER IN HIS MIND THE MOST APPROPRIATE MEASURES COME 
I DON'T KNOW HOW 
BYRD WAS VERY EXPLICIT THAT HE LIKED TO READ THE WORDS AND CONTEMPLATE THEM BEFORE SETTING THEM TO MUSIC 
YOU CAN TELL LISTENING TO JUSTORUM ANIMAE 
THAT HE'S READ THAT HE'S READ THAT TEXT 
AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT SO CAREFULLY BEFORE GET GOING AND HE'S HELD HIMSELF BACK 
BECAUSE HE WANTS THE WORDS TO COME THROUGH WITH MAXIMUM IMPACT 
BYRD IS EXPRESSING HIS OWN PERSONAL VIEWS AT TIME WHEN IT WAS DANGEROUS TO DO SO 
AND WRITING FOR PEOPLE WHO SHARED HIS VIEW 
AND WHO WANTED TO USE THE CATHOLIC WORDS AS A WAY OF REGISTERING THEIR PROTEST AND THEIR BELIEF 
ILLI AUTEM SUNT 
BUT WHEN HE GETS TO THE END ABOUT THE SOULS OF THE DEPARTED SHALL BE IN PEACE 
HE ALLOWS HIMSELF A MUCH MORE LUXURIANT KIND OF MUSIC 
AND THE REASON HE'S DONE THAT I'M SURE IS HE WANTS THROUGH THE MUSIC NOT JUST THE WORD SETTING 
BUT THE ACTUAL MUSICAL FLOW TO MIMIC THE IDEA OF PEACE AS IN THE TEXT 
IT'S LIKE RIPPLES GOING ALONG 
IT'S GOT A CALMING EFFECT 
TIME AND TIME AGAIN BYRD HIS WIFE CHILDREN AND SERVANTS 
WERE ALL SUMMONED BEFORE THE COURTS FOR FAILING TO ATTEND SERVICES HERE AT STONDON MASSEY PARISH CHURCH 
OVER THE YEARS THE FAMILY MUST HAVE PAID OUT MANY HUNDREDS OF POUNDS IN FINES A FORTUNE AT THE TIME 
BUT BYRD REMAINED RESOLUTE IN THE OLD FAITH 
THIS IS A SMALL VESTRY 
AH HERE'S WILLIAM BYRD'S WILL 
THE WAY HE ASKED TO BE BURIED HERE NEAR HIS WIFE 
WHICH IS SORT OF IRONIC ISN'T IT CONSIDERING HE DIDN'T COME TO CHURCH THAT OFTEN 
SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME TRYING TO AVOID IT 
I FIND THIS QUITE A SAD SIGNATURE REALLY 
A DETERMINED OLD M. A N. EIGHTY TWO 
WE SEE STROKES IN THE LOWER PART OF THE LETTERS THAT ARE EXTREMELY THICK AND LONG 
TO ME THESE REPRESENT THE STRENGTH OF BYRD'S FEELING 
BUT HE'S AN OLD MAN AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE FALLING LINE OF THIS SIGNATURE 
IN COMPARISON WITH THE STRAIGHT LINES OF THE WILL ITSELF 
HOW HE WAS BEING DRAGGED DOWN AND YOU FEEL THAT HE'S STILL DETERMINED 
HE'S STILL PERSISTENT 
BUT HOW MUCH LONGER CAN HE GO ON FIGHTING 
BYRD DIED IN THE SUMMER OF ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THE CAUSE OF DEATH IS NOT RECORDED 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS WISHES HE WAS BURIED HERE IN STONDON CHURCHYARD 
THERE'S NO SIGN OF WILLIAM OR INDEED ANY OF THE BYRD FAMILY 
THE OLDEST HEADSTONES SEEM TO BE ABOUT SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
BUT THEN TIME AND LICHEN HAVE ERODED SO MANY OF THE INSCRIPTIONS 
AND PERHAPS WILLIAM HAD NO HEADSTONE AT ALL 
AT THIS TIME CATHOLIC BURIAL IN CONSECRATED GROUND WAS ONLY JUST TOLERATED 
MOST CATHOLIC FUNERALS TOOK PLACE AT DUSK 
AN EXCUSE FOR CANDLES PERHAPS 
BUT THIS WAS STILL FORBIDDEN RITUAL 
LIBERA 
BYRD'S ATTITUDE TO HIS CHOSEN TEXTS WAS UNCOMPROMISING 
HOLY WORDS IN WHICH WERE SUNG THE PRAISES OF GOD 
DESERVE NOTHING LESS THAN A HEAVENLY HARMONY TO THE EXTENT WE CAN ATTAIN IT 
TIME AND TIME AGAIN HE STRESSES THAT HIS MISSION IS TO ADORN DIVINE THINGS 
WITH THE HIGHEST ART OF WHICH HE'S CAPABLE 
IN THE FINAL EPISODE OF SACRED MUSIC 
I GO BEYOND TALLIS AND BYRD 
AS MY JOURNEY TAKES ME TO GERMANY TO DISCOVER TWO GENIUSES OF THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION 
MARTIN LUTHER AND JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH 
LIBERA 
ME DOMINE
