TRY AND APPEAR LIKE A RESPECTABLE G. P. UNDERSTOOD 
UNDERSTOOD GOOD AFTERNOON 
SO ARE WE ALL SET 
YES WHEN YOU'RE READY 
GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN MY NAME IS JULIA PARSONS 
I AM THE PRACTICE MANAGER FOR THE MILL HEALTH CENTRE 
THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE DOCTOR DANIEL GRANGER 
NOW RIGHT FROM THE START WHEN WE OPENED THE MILL IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
WE HAD A VISION OF HOW WE WANTED THE PRACTICE TO PROGRESS AND GROW 
AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO SAY THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED THOSE AIMS 
WE NOW PROVIDE SERVICES AS FAR RANGING AS CARDIOVASCULAR 
I'M VERY PROUD OF THE TEAM THAT WE'VE BUILT UP AT THE MILL 
AND I'M PROUD OF THE KIND OF STRENGTHS AND DEDICATION THAT THEY SHOW 
AND IT'S ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO BRING TO THE CAMPUS SURGERY 
HI 
BEFORE JOINING THE MILL HEALTH TEAM I WORKED AT A UNIVERSITY SURGERY IN EAST LONDON 
AND THE KEY TO WORKING WITH STUDENTS YOU REALISE PRETTY QUICKLY IS TO BE AVAILABLE AND AVAILABLE FAST 
A STUDENT'S HEALTH IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THEIR PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND WELFARE 
LETHERBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRIDES ITSELF ON HAVING A LOW DROP OUT RATE WHICH WE FEEL WE CAN IMPROVE 
OFFERING THE VERY BEST STANDARD OF TREATMENT AND ADVICE AS AND WHEN THE STUDENT NEEDS IT THANK YOU 
O. K. THANK YOU 
LEWIS IS STABLE 
IT WAS TOUCH AND GO THEY RECKONED HE COULD'VE DIED IF YOU HADN'T GOT HERE SO SOON 
THAT'S SOMETHING I SUPPOSE 
WELL WE'VE DEALT WITH LEWIS BEFORE HIS PREVIOUS RECORD SHOULD GO IN ADIEL'S FAVOUR 
WHAT ABOUT REVENGE ATTACKS WILL THE BOYS GET PROTECTION 
I CAN'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING 
THAT'S IT 
YEAH MY MAIN CONCERN NOW IS WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE ESTATE 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WITH LEWIS IN HOSPITAL THERE'LL BE A POWER STRUGGLE WITHIN THE GANG 
LOOK YOU'VE DONE YOUR BIT BUT IT'S A SMALL RIPPLE IN A BIG POND 
I SHOULD'VE NEVER GOT YOU INTO THIS LIKE I'D LISTEN TO YOU 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
HEY WHERE IS EVERYONE 
NEVER MIND THAT WHAT ABOUT YOU 
JULIA MENTIONED SOME KID GETTING STABBED I HOPE YOU WEREN'T PLAYING THE HERO 
NO CHANCE OF THAT BAD DAY JUST WISH I COULD'VE DONE MORE 
YOU CAN'T FIX EVERYONE 
HERE YOU ARE HAVE A CHOCOLATE 
DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'VE HAD ANYTHING TO EAT ALL DAY I'M NOT REALLY HUNGRY 
SO WHAT HAPPENED DID JULIA FIND A REPLACEMENT FOR ME 
IF YOU CAN CALL HIM THAT 
DANIEL 
REALLY 
YEAH EXACTLY 
I HAD MY DOUBTS AS WELL YOU KNOW 
UNDERSTANDABLE YOU DID AN AMAZING JOB IN THERE DANIEL 
THANK YOU OH UM 
SEE YOU IN A MINUTE I HAD TOO MUCH HERBAL TEA 
SO HOW DO YOU RATE OUR CHANCES 
WELL IT WAS COMPREHENSIVE 
VERY WELL DELIVERED MM 
YOU CAN BE QUIETLY CONFIDENT 
LOOK THIS IS AWKWARD BUT I HAVE TO ASK 
IF I'VE SAID ANYTHING LOOK IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS HAS IT 
BESIDES I DON'T THINK IT WOULD DO EITHER OF US ANY FAVOURS 
NO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE 
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT SLEEP WITH ELLEN 
HAND IT OVER OR YOU'LL KNOW WHAT SLAUGHTER REALLY IS 
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A PARTNERSHIP YOU AND ME 
IS ANYONE THERE 
JUST TALK TO US 
IF I TELL THE WORLD 
I'LL NEVER SAY ENOUGH 
COS IT WAS NOT SAID TO YOU 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED TO DO 
IF I END UP WITH YOU 
TALK 
HOLBY BLUE BEING A GOOD COP IS JUST THE HALF OF IT
