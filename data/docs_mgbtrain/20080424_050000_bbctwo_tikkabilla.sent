SOME NEW 
BRIDGES ARE BUILT TO GET US FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER 
OFTEN OVER WATER 
FOOTBRIDGES

OVER HERE WE'VE GOT THREE RIVERS 
A NARROW RIVER ON THE END NARROW

BUT SHALL WE JUST TRY THE SMALL BRIDGE ANYWAY 
LET'S GIVE THE SMALL BRIDGE A GO O. K.

SOMETIMES WHEN THE SKY GOES GREY THERE MIGHT BE A THUNDERSTORM 
IN A THUNDERSTORM THERE ARE FLASHES OF LIGHT IN THE SKY 
THIS IS CALLED LIGHTNING AND THAT RUMBLING NOISE IS THUNDER 
AT NIGHT THE SKY IS DARK 
BUT YOU SEE THINGS IN IT IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY 
WHEN THERE ARE NO CLOUDS YOU CAN SEE LOTS OF STARS IN THE SKY 
ON SOME NIGHTS YOU MIGHT SEE THE MOON 
WHEN THE MOON IS A CIRCLE OR A FULL MOON 
IT'S BRIGHT ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NIGHT SKY 
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT 
THE SKY GETS LIGHTER AS THE SUN COMES UP 
THIS IS CALLED SUNRISE 
AS THE SUN RISES AT THE START OF THE DAY 
THE SKY CAN BE VERY COLOURFUL 
THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN 
THE SKY CAN BE VERY COLOURFUL TOO THIS IS CALLED A SUN S. ET 
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE COLOURFUL YOU CAN SEE IN THE SKY 
IT'S A RAINBOW 
WHEN YOU GET RAIN AND SUN IN THE SKY AT THE SAME TIME
