HELP IN THE DESPERATE SEARCH FOR 
SURVIVORS OF MONDAY'S EARTHQUAKE 
OFFICIALS SAY THE NUMBER OF DEAD 
COULD REACH FIFTY THOUSAND AND UP TO FIVE 
MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEFT 
HOMELESS THERE'S ANGER INSIDE 
CHINA ABOUT WHY SO MANY SCHOOLS AND 
PUBLIC BUILDINGS FAILED TO 
WITHSTAND THE EARTHQUAKE AS THE 
HOURS WEAR ON THE CHANCES OF 
FINDING SOMEONE ANYONE ALIVE ARE 
RARE RARE BUT STILL THEY EMERGE THIS ELDERLY 
WOMAN PULLED FROM THE RUBBLE SHE 
THANKS A HIGHER POWER FOR SALVATION 
AND IN SAFE HANDS NOW THESE THREE 
LITTLE GIRLS WHO WERE RESCUED AFTER 
EIGHTY SEVEN HOURS IN THE DARK THERE WASN'T 
ENOUGH SPACE TO GET OUT AS SHE SAYS 
AS HER EYES ARE SHIELDED FROM THE 
DAYLIGHT INSIDE WAS HER FATHER HE 
SAYS I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HER 
CONDITION WAS BUT KNOWING SHE WAS 
THERE COMFORTED ME SHE SAID DGS 
DADDY I'M FINE BUT FEW WILL BE 
FOUND NOW IT'S STILL THE OLD 
SEARCH AND THERE'S HELP FROM 
OVERSEAS THESE ESPECIALLY TRAINED 
RESCUE TEAMS ARE FROMFY WANT THIS 
IS WHAT THEY FACE FIVE MILLION 
HAVE BEEN MADE HOMELESS A QUARTER 
OF THE POPULATION HERE SCHOOLS 
WERE PARTICULARLY BADLY HIT SEVEN THOUSAND 
FELL ACROSS THE PROVINCE PARENTS 
WANT TO KNOW Y. PEOPLE SAID SHROEDY 
WORKMANSHIP THE GOVERNMENT 
PROMISED AN INVESTIGATION THERE'S 
A MORE IMMEDIATE TASK AT HAND 
BURYING THE DEAD AND PROTECTING 
AGAINST DISEASE 
THE FOCUS NOW IS FIRMLY ON THOSE 
STRUGGLING WITH THE AFTERMATH 
THESE THREE SHEETS OF PLASTIC HAVE 
BECOME HOME FOR THE TWENTY THREE MEMBERS OF 
THE LO FAMILY THIS WOMAN WAS 
VISITING HER SON WHEN THE QUAKE 
STRUCK SHE NOW ONLY HAS THIS RADIO 
FOR COMPANY 
I'M FROM ANOTHER PROVINCE COMING HERE I HAVE NO ONE 
TO RELY ON I HAVE NO PLACE TO GO 
IT IS HARD I HOPE THE GOVERNMENT 
WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AND 
HELP US 
TAKING CARE OF HER AND THE 
REMAINING SURVIVORS IS NOW WHAT 
MATTERS WELL LET'S SPEAK TO OUR 
CORRESPONDENT HE IS IN ONE OF THE 
CITIES CENTRE OF THE DEVASTATION 
WE'RE SEEING SOME OF THOSE 
HARROWING IMAGES OF THOSE PEOPLE 
BROUGHT OUT OF SOME OF THE RUBBLE 
STILL ALIVE AFTER WHAT SIX DAYS 
NOW THOSE SEARCHES CARRYING ON 
ARE THEY 
WELL CHARLIE THE SAD 
FACT IS THOSE ARE GOING TO BE 
INCREASINGLY RARE SCENES THE FOCUS 
AS YOU JUST HEARD ON MY REPORT IS 
ON THOSE WHO HAVE SURVIVED 
PROTECTING AGAINST DISEASE AND 
CLEARLY UP AND GETTING ESSENTIAL 
SUPPLIES THERE'S A TOWN ABOUT AN 
HOUR AND A HALF TWO HOURS AWAY 
FROM HERE NORTH FROM HERE THAT 
WAS BADLY HIT WE WERE THERE 
YESTERDAY MORNING AND LAST NIGHT 
AND THERE THEY WERE CLEARING THE 
RUBBLE AWAY NOW THEY'RE USING 
LARGE EARTH MOVERS DUMB PER TRUCKS 
ARE TAKING PILES OF RUBBLE OUT OF 
THE TOWN BUT PEOPLE THERE HAVE 
TENTS CLEAN WATER THEY HAVE AS 
MUCH FOOD AS THEY NEED THE RELIEF 
HAS REALLY GOT TO WHERE IT'S NEEDED 
OF COURSE FURTHER NORTH IN THE 
MORE DIFFICULT TO REACH AREAS 
PEOPLE ARE STILL STRUGGLING BUT 
THE MASSIVE EFFORT THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT HAS THROWN AT THIS 
DISASTER IS REALLY PAYING OFF IN 
MANY OF THE DISASTER ZONES THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE GOVERNMENT'S 
POLICY ON PLASTIC BAGS IS ALLOWING 
SUPERMARKETS TO PASS THE BUCK FOR 
CUTTING WASTE ON TO SHOPPERS 
THAT'S ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S OWN ADVISERS HE SAYS 
FOCUS ON CARRIER BAGS IS DIVERTING 
ATTENTION FROM PRESSING 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IT IS 
CONFUSING CUSTOMERS IF YOU'RE 
DOING A SUPERMARKET SHOP THIS 
WEEKEND YOU MAY NOTICE A 
DIFFERENCE AT THE TILLS SING USE 
PLASTIC BAGS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY 
WITH MARKS AND AMP SPENCERS CHARGES AND 
VARIOUS OTHERS USING ENSENTIVES TO 
REDUCE THE USE WHY SO MUCH 
ATTENTION ONE ADVISER THINKS THE 
GOVERNMENT'S OVERREACTING TO WHAT 
IS A RELATIVE INSIGNIFICANT PROBLEM 
AND SUPERMARKETS ARE PASSING THE 
BUCK TO CUSTOMERS 
THEY HAVE POWER 
THEY HAVE PURCHASING POWER THEY 
HAVE POWER IN TERMS WHAT THEY BUY 
AND HOW IT'S PACKED THE PROBLEM IS 
IN A SENSE BY FOCUSING ON THE 
CONSUMER END THEY ARE TO SOME 
EXTENT DIVERTING ATTENTION FROM 
WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING 
CUSTOMERS SEE PLASTIC BAGS AS AN 
ISSUE BUT IN REALITY THEY'RE A 
SMALL PROPORTION OF THE WASTE 
THEY'RE A SMALL PROPORTION OF OIL 
THEY USE AND THEREFORE IN OVERALL 
RESOURCE TERMS IT IS A VISUAL THING 
RATHER THAN A MAINSTREAM ISSUE THE THE GOVERNMENT'S PUT PRESSURE ON 
RETAILERS AND SUPERMARKETS GIVING 
THEM AN ULTIMATUM TO REDUCE PLASTIC 
BAG USE BY A QUARTER OR FACE TAXES 
IT IS MAKING PROVISION FOR BAG TAX 
BILL AND RETAILERS SAYS FOCUSING 
ON BAGS IS WASTING THEIR TIME 
THERE ARE IMPORTANT PROVISIONS 
WITHIN THE CLIMATE CHANGE BILL WE 
SUPPORT THIS IS TRIVIAL ISSUE TO 
ADD ON TO IT IT IS NOT JUST A 
SLEDGEHAMMER BUT STEAM ROLLER TO 
CRACK A WALNUT IT ISN'T THE BEST 
USE OF OUR RESOURCENESS TERMS OF 
ALL THE ISSUES WE NEED TO BE 
ADDRESSING 
THIS WASTE HERE IS ADDRESSING DSETINED FOR LANDFILL SITES BUT 
LESS THAN TWO PER CENT WHAT GOES INTO 
LANDFILL IS MADE UP OF PACKAGING 
AND A TINY FRACTION IS MADE UP PLAS 
IT CAN BAGS THE GOVERNMENT ADMITS 
TAXING PLASTIC BAGS IS UNLIKELY TO 
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON 
VOLUMES OF WASTE BUT IT SAYS 
THAT'S NOT THE POINT 
WE KNOW THE 
PUBLIC IS ON OUR SIDE THEY WANT 
ACTION IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE 
THAT ACTION IT MAY BE A SMALL PART 
OF THE WASTE BUT IT IS SYMBOLIC OF 
OUR THRO AWAY SOCIETY SO WE NEED 
TO DO SOMETHING QUITE DRAMATICALLY 
TO CURB THEIR USE 
THE GOVERNMENT 
MAY HOPE THAT PLASTIC BAG GUILT 
WILL MAKE US ALL BECOME ECO 
FRIENDLY WHATEVER THE MOTIVES OR 
CRITICISM REDUCING THEIR USE AND 
THE EYE SOAR THEY CAUSE CAN BE NO 
BAD THING SORE LATER THIS 
MORNING WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE 
SUPERMARKET MORRISONS WHO WILL BE 
GIVING AWAY REUSABLE PLASTIC BAGS 
TO ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS SOME 
HOLIDAY MAKERS ARE ASKED TO PAY 
EXTRA FOR THEIR TRIPS AFTER THEY 
PAID WHAT THEY BELIEVED WAS THE 
FULL PRICE BREAKFAST DISCOVERED 
THE TWENTY THREE FIRMS ARE ASKING FOR MORE 
CASH TO COVER THE AIRLINE FUEL AND 
STRONGER EURO THE CONSUMERS' 
ASSOCIATION SAYS TRAVEL FIRMS 
SHOULD BE CLEARER ABOUT SURCHARGES 
WE WILL BE TALK TOGETHER 
ASSOCIATION OF BRITISH TRAVEL 
AGENTS ABOUT THOSE EXTRA COSTS IN A 
FEW MINUTES' TIME THE HUSBAND OF A 
TELEVISION MAKE UP ARTIST HAS BEEN 
CHARGED WITH HER MURDER SHE 
DISAPPEARED IN JANUARY HER BODY 
WAS FOUND BY A DOG WALKER ON 
THURSDAY THE CAUSE OF DEATH HAS 
NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED HER 
HUSBAND DAVID IS DUE DO APPEAR AT 
HASTINGS MAGISTRATES' COURT TODAY 
GORDON BROWN ACCUSED THE BURMESE 
REGIME OF INHUMAN TREATMENT BY 
PREVENTING AID FROM GETTING THROUGH 
TO THE SURVIVORS OF THE CYCLONE HE 
TOLD THE B. B. C. THE BURMESE GENERAL 
SHOULD BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR THE 
INTOLERABLE SITUATION THE OFFICIAL 
ESTIMATES PUT THE DEAD OR MISSING 
AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND THE B. B. C. IS PREVENTED 
FROM REPORTING INSIDE BURMA OUR 
REPORTER IS IN THAILAND FOR US THIS 
MORNING MORNING IF YOU CAN GIVE US YOUR BEST 
ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION IN BURMA 
AS IT STANDS NOW 
WELL CERTAINLY 
FROM THE INTERNATIONAL RELIEF 
ORGANISATIONS WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING 
TO HERE IN BANGKOK THEY SAY IT IS 
STILL INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED THIS 
STORM IT WAS EXACTLY A FORTNIGHT 
AGO FOR TWO WEEKS THEY HAVE BEEN 
LIVING OFF THE DELTA THE WEATHER'S 
TERRIBLE THAT'S MADE THINGS WORSE 
THE FACT ON FRIDAY YESTERDAY THE 
BURMESE GOVERNMENT IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
DOUBLED ITS ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBER 
KILLED AND THE NUMBER STILL MISSING 
SHOWS YOU HOW CONFUSED THE PICTURE 
IS ON THE GROUND THEY BLAMED THE 
DIFFICULTIES THEY WERE HAVING ON 
GETTING ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE 
FACT THEY WERE DOUBLELING THOSE 
ESTIMATES WHAT THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY IS SAYING UNLESS YOU CAN 
GET AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF WHAT IS 
GOING ON IT IS DIFFICULT TO HELP 
PEOPLE THEY SAY THAT TO GET AN 
ACCURATE PICTURE THEY WANT THE 
BURMESE GOVERNMENT TO ACCEPT MORE 
HELP 
EVEN THE BURMESE OFFICIALLY HELP ACKNOWLEDGING THE NUMBERS ARE GOING 
UP AND YET GORDON BROWN HAS MADE 
AN UPFRONT CRITICISM OF THE REGIME 
THERE SEEMS NO INDICATION THEY ARE 
PREPARED TO CHANGE THEIR STANCE ON 
ACCEPTING HELP FROM OUTSIDE NONE NONE AT ALL THERE WAS LITTLE GLIMMER OF 
HOPE LAST WEEK WHEN THEY SAID THEY 
WOULD ACCEPT ONE HUNDRED SIX EXPERTS WERE 
VARIOUS ASIAN NATIONS THE GROUPING 
OF SOUTH EAST ASIAN NATIONS 
ESSENTIALLY THEY WERE SAYING WE 
WILL ACCEPT RELIEF WORKERS FROM 
NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES NOW 
INTERNATIONAL AID AGENCIES HERE IN 
BANGKOK ARE SEIZING ON THAT 
BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING IF THOSE 
PEOPLE GO IN AND IF THEY DO A GOOD 
JOB PERHAPS THEN THAT WILL 
PERSUADE THE BURMESE THAT THEIR 
MOTIVES INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S 
MOTIVES ARE HUMANITARIAN AND NOT 
POLITICAL BUT AT THE MOMENT 
THERE'S REALLY NOT VERY MUCH TO GO 
ON THAT'S WHY WE SEE THIS LANGUAGE 
FROM GORDON BROWN IN THE UNITED 
NATIONS ON FRIDAY NIGHT LAST NIGHT 
THERE WAS VERY UNDIPLOMATIC 
LANGUAGE FROM THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR 
WHO SAID THE BR M. E. E. S. GOVERNMENT'S 
REFUSAL TO OUTSIDE HELP VERGING ON 
A CRIME OF HUMANITYY IT SHOWS THE 
FRUSTRATION INTENSE FRUSTRATION OF 
THE AID WAITING THERE THE SHIPS 
ARE IN THE WATERS BUT THE BURMESE 
GENERALS QUIBBLELING OVER THE 
PERMISSIONS NEEDED TO GET THE AID 
UNLOADED

LEAD AGO TEAM OUT IN THE CUP FINAL

GOING BACK FOR A FINAL WILL BE A 
GREAT DAY 
FANS WILL EXPECT A HEAVY 
POLICE PRESENCE AROUND WEMBLEY 
PARTICULARLY AFTER THE PROBLEMS IN 
MANCHESTER THE BUT FOR THE PLAYERS 
THIS IS A CHANCE TO GRAB A PIECE OF 
SPORTING HISTORY JUST TO REMIND 
YOU YOU CAN WATCH THE MATCH THIS 
AFTERNOON AT THREE P. M. LIVE ON B. B. C. ONE 
THAT'S A LOOK AT OUR TOP STORIES 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS 
HOLIDAY MAKERS ARE BEING ASKED TO 
STUMP UP MORE MONEY FOR THE 
HOLIDAYS THEY'VE ALREADY PAID FOR 
THE TRAVEL AGENCIES SAYS IT IS 
BECAUSE OF THE RISING COSTS IN FUEL 
AND THE EXCHANGE RATES 
SUMMER HOLIDAYS THEY'RE ALL ABOUT 
SUN SAND AND SEA BUT THIS YEAR 
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE 
SURCHARGES SOME HOLIDAY COMPANIES 
ARE FORCING THEIR CUSTOMERS TO PAY 
MORE FOR THEIR SUMMER BREAK THEY 
BLAME IT ON THE STRENGTH OF THE 
EURO EURO SO FAR TWENTY THREE HOLIDAY FIRMS ASK FOR 
EXTRA AND ABTA SAYS SEVERAL 
THOUSAND HOLIDAY MAKERS ARE BEING 
AFFECTED AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE 
FACING RISING COSTS ELSEWHERE IT 
IS A MOVE THAT IS NOT GOING DOWN 
ELSEWHERE 
THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY IS ELSEWHERE ONE OF THE ONLY INDUSTRIES WHERE 
YOU CAN PAY FOR A PRODUCT AND A 
MONTH OR TWO BEFORE YOU TAKE IT UP 
YOU'RE ASKED TO PAY MORE WE THINK 
THE INDUSTRY SHOULD PUT THEIR HOUSE 
IN ORDER AND STOP PASSING 
SURCHARGES ON TO CUSTOMERS SO SO WHAT CAN COMPANIES MAKE THEIR 
CUSTOMERS PAY UNDER ABTA'S RULES 
THEY CAN CHARGE UP TO TEN PER CENT EXTRA 
ALTHOUGH THEY ONE TO ABSORB THE FIRST 
TWO PER CENT THEY CAN ASK FOR EXTRA MONEY TO 
COVER THINGS LIKE AIRLINE FUEL AND 
AIRPORT TAXES AND CURRENCY 
FLUCTUATIONS BUT THEY CANNOT ASK 
FOR THE MONEY IF IT IS LESS THAN THIRTY 
DAYS BEFORE DEPARTURE THE BIGGEST 
OPERATORS THOMAS COOK AND TUI 
WHICH OWNS FIRST CHOICE HAVE SAID 
THEY WON'T ASK 
OTHERS 
HAVE NOT GIVEN THIS GRABTY 
PROVIDED ABTA SAY THEY HAVE ON 
ABSORBED THE INITIAL TWO PER CENT THEY CAN 
CHARGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT PAID 
IN FULL FOR YOUR HOLIDAY HOLIDAYS HOLIDAYS ARE ALWAYS EXPENSIVE SO EVEN IF 
YOU ARE ASKED TO PAY A FEW EXTRA 
PERAGES IT CAN REALLY CUT INTO 
YOUR BUDGET AND IT MAY MEAN YOU 
HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR PLANS WHEN YOU 
GET THERE BUT SOME SMALL OPERATORS 
BELIEVE THERE IS NO REASON TO MAKE 
CUSTOMERS PAY A SURCHARGE IN THE 
FIRST PLACE 
OVER THE YEARS THE 
POUND HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY STRONG 
THEREFORE WE AND I'M SURE OTHERS 
HAVE DONE INCREDIBLY EIGHT NOW THE 
POUND IS HEADING IN THE OTHER WAY 
I'M NOT SURE IT IS RIGHT TO TURN TO 
THE CUSTOMERS TO BAIL US OUT 
SOME ARE SUGGESTING THAT THE 
COMPANIES ARE NOT BEING OPEN YES YES IT IS QUITE TRANSPARENT IT MIGHT 
BE IN THE SMALL PRINT IN THE 
BROCHURES AT THE BACK BUT THERE 
ARE LOTS OF OTHER ISSUES TUCKED 
AWAY IN THERE TOO SO YES THERE 
ARE RULES AND GUIDELINES AND THEY 
HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT 
THE CUSTOMER 
SO FAR MOST TRAVEL FIRMS ARE NOT 
ADDING A SUR SHARGE BUT THEY COULD 
STILL DO SO SURCHARGE BUT THEY 
COULD STILL DO SO DURING THE SUMMER 
ESPECIALLY IF THE POUND FALLS AGAIN 
AGAINST THE EURO FRANCES JOINS ME 
NOW THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THIS 
STORY BECAUSE IF YOU WERE ONE OF 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO BUDGETED CAREFULLY 
AND TIGHTLY AND YOU RECKONED ON 
THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND PAID FOR 
IT IN FULL AND NOW YOU FIND OUT IT 
WILL COST YOU MORE BUT YOU HAVE TO 
PAY IT BECAUSE YOU WOULD LOSE OUT 
IF YOU DIDN'T THAT'S A REAL 
PROBLEM 
SURCHARGING IS A PROBLEM PROBLEM IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE COMPANIES 
TO DO IT IT IS COSTLY TO COLLECT 
AND ALSO YOU'RE LOSING CUSTOMERS 
BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT COME BACK THE 
NEXT YEAR IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT 
TOUR OPERATORS WANT TO DO THEY 
WOULD RATHER NOT DEAL WITH IT BUT 
THEY HAVE THIS EXPENSE 
IF YOU ARE 
IN THAT SITUATION AND THE TOUR 
COMPANY SAYS WE NEED ANOTHER 
EIGHTY AND YOU SAY ACTUALLY I 
CAN'T PAY THAT WHAT HAPPENS DO 
THEY GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK THE THE LAW IS ON THE SIDE OF THE TOUR 
OPERATOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE IMPOSED 
THESE VARIOUS RULES THEY HAVE TO 
ABSORB THE FIRST PER CENT BECAUSE THEY 
RECOGNISE THAT THINGS CAN CHANGE 
AND WILL YOU LOSE THE WHOLE LOT 
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE PAID WELL WELL CANCELLATION CHARGES WILL COME IN 
TO PLAY SO IT DEPENDS ON THOSE 
AND SOME COMPANIES DO IT AND SOME 
DON'T HOW IS IT THAT SOME ARE ABLE 
TO AND SOME ARE ABLE TO SWALLOW THE 
EXTRA COSTS 
A LOT OF THE BIGGER 
COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO HEDGE AND 
PLAY THE CURRENCY MARKETS AND THEY 
ARE JUST BIGGER AND ABLE TO ABSORB 
SOME OF THE LOSTS AND SOME OF THE 
SMALLER COMPANIES JUST CAN'T DO 
THAT SO THEY ARE PUT IN A POSITION 
THEY MIGHT GO TO THE WALL 
UNTIL THEY IMPOSE THE SURCHARGES 
WHAT ADVICE DO YOU GIVE TO 
POTENTIAL HOLIDAY MAKERS IS THERE 
A LOGIC IN LEAVING THINGS UNTIL 
LATER SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING 
TO PAY 
TOUR OPERATORS CANNOT 
IMPOSE A SUR CHANNELLING WITHIN THIRTY 
DAYS OF DEPARTURE SO I SUPPOSE 
IF YOU LEAVE IT TO THE LAST MINUTE 
YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO GET A 
SURCHARGE BUT BOOKING EARLY MEANS 
YOU GET MORE FLEXIBLE OPTIONS AND 
YOU PAY A CHEAPER PRICE THEN THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE HEADLINES 
FOR THE FIRST TIME CHINA IS 
ALLOWING FOREIGN RESCUE WORKERS 
INTO THE COUNTRY TO HELP IN THE 
SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS OF MONDAY'S 
EARTHQUAKE EARTHQUAKE CUTTING DOWN ON PLASTIC BAGS BUT

DEVELOP ACROSS THE SOUTH EAST AND 
HEAVY THUNDERY DOWNPOURS INTO THE

CLOUDY WITH OUTBREAKS OF RAIN AND 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND BY THIS 
AFTERNOON THE CLOUD COULD PRODUCE 
ONE OR TWO SHOWERS IN SCOTLAND IT

ENGLAND AND NEW ZEALAND THE RAIN 
WILL CONTINUE OVERNIGHT ACROSS SOME 
PARTS OF SOUTHERN WALES AND ENGLAND 
BUT FURTHER NORTH AND THE SKIES 
WILL CLEAR AND FRESHER AIR WILL 
SEEP ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THERE 
COULD BE A TOUCH OF GROUND FROST

AND SCOTLAND SO A CHILLY START TO 
SUNDAY BUT COMPARED TO THIS 
MORNING IT WILL BE A DRIER AND 
BRIGHTER MORNING FOR MANY AND 
LATER ON SUNSHINE OVER THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF ENGLAND AND WALES BUT 
ELSEWHERE RAIN WILL CLEAR FROM THE 
SOUTH COAST AND A LITTLE MORE CLOUD

TO CELEBRITY MAGAZINE FOR A 
REPORTED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE INTERVIEW A 
DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HOW THE 
RELATIONSHIP FLOURISHED BUT THE 
SALE OF THE STORY RAISED A FEW EYE 
BORROWS IN ROYAL CIRCLES 
I DON'T

ONE WAY OF GETTING IT ALL OUT IN

THE FIRST TIME SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE TEAM 
OUTSIDE THE BIG FOUR OF MANCHESTER 
UNITED ARSENAL AND LIVERPOOL WILL 
LIFT THE CUP WE'VE SEEN SHOCKS IN 
THIS CUP AND CARDIFF COULD SPRING 
A SURPRISE BUT PORTSMOUTH 
ASSISTANT MANAGER SEES THIS AS A 
CHANCETOR POMPEY TO MAKE HISTORY 
IT IS NOT AN ARSENAL OR MAN UNITED 
AND THAT SHOULD INSPIRE THEM MORE 
FOR ME IT IS LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES 
TO WIN THE F. A. CUP I GOT LUCKY I 
WAS WITH A MASSIVE CLUB A FEW TIMES 
AND GOT A FEW MORE OPPORTUNITIES 
THAN MOST BUT THAT SHOULD INSPIRE 
THESE PLAYERS THAT IT MAY NOT COME 
ALONG AGAIN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE THE LAST TIME 
LET'S GRAB IT AND WIN IT 
IT IS AN 
AMAZING FEELING AND YEAH IT'S 
GREAT WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY 
AND TO GO WITH A CLUB LIKE CARDIFF 
TO A F. A. CUP FINAL AND NOT GOING 
WILL JUST TO MAKE UP THE NUMBERS 
JUST GOING TO BATTLE AND TO GIVE A 
GO AND HOPEFULLY BRING THE CUP BACK 
WE'LL BE LIVE AT WEMBLEY IN AN 
HOUR AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY

SHOWPIECE GAME AGAINST QUEEN OF 
SOUTH RANGERS HAVE THREE S. P. L. GAMES 
TO FIT IN THEY PLAY AT MOTHERWELL 
AND AGAIN ON MONDAY AND THURSDAY 
THE CHANCE OF THE QUAD DROUPEL IS 
GONE BUT THE TREBLE IS STILL ON 
EVERYBODY HERE FACES A BIG TEST TO 
GET THEMSELVES LIFTED AND GET 
THROUGH WHAT'S AN UNUSUAL 
CIRCUMSTANCE FOR ANY TEAM TO BE 
PLAYING THREE LEAGUE GAMES IN SUCH 
A SHORT SPACE OF TIME WITH 
IMPORTANCE PLACED ON THEM PLUS ALL 
AWAY FROM HOME IT IS A DIFFICULT 
TASK AND ONE THAT I DON'T THINK 
MANY TEAMS ARE ASKED TO DO 
ENGLAND'S CRICKETERS WILL BE HOPING 
TO BUILD BIG LEAD OF THE FIRST 
DAY OF THE THIRD TEST AT LORDS SO 
FAR THE MATCH IS BADLY AAFFECTED BY 
BAD LIGHT AND RAIN INTERRUPTIONS 
ENGLAND WILL RESUME ON SIXTY EIGHT WITHOUT 
LOSS IT REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
THE ENGLAND BATSMEN COMING OUT OF 
THE LORDS PAVILION THEY LEFT NEW 
ZEALAND OFF THE HOOK THE KEY WAS 
NOT TO GET THEM AWAY AGAIN 
SIDEBOTTOM CAUGHT BEHIND HE BUILT 
A STUBBORN PARTNERSHIP AND THERE 
WAS CONTINUED RESISTANCE WITH 
SWEEPING SHOTS 
PRET PRET 
SIDEBOTTOM DID FOR HIM TOO THOUGH 
NEW ZEALAND'S TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN QUITE 
RESPECTABLE CONSIDERING THE START 
THEY MADE ON THE FIRST DAY PLAYING 
CRICKET IN MAY IS ALWAYS PERILESS 
BUSINESS BAD LIGHT REGULARLY 
STOPPED PLAY SPECTATORS FROM 
FORCED TO USE OTHER THINGS TO FILL 
THEIR TIME COOK AND STRAUSS ADDED 
RUNS BUT IT WAS FRUSTRATING FOR 
ALL ALL THERE WERE A COUPLE OF GAMES IN THE 
SUPER LEAGUE THE LEADERS LEEDS 
BEAD WAKEFIELD BY FIFTY EIGHT TO TWELVE WHILE 
WIGAN CAME BEHIND TO DEFEAT 
WARRINGTON FORTY EIGHT TO FOURTEEN WARRINGTON 
SUFFERED SECOND HALF BLITZ FROM 
WIGAN WARRIORS NOTCHED UP ZERO UNANSWERED POINTS 
THE FORMER ONE HUNDRED METRES HOLDER

LEAGUE IN THE WORLD I BELIEVE AND

UNDERSTAND THE FANS INCLUDES LIKE

STATISTICALLY EVERY SINGLE 
FOOTBALL CLUB THAT IS IN THE HANDS 
OF A FOREIGN OWNER HAS DONE THE 
SAME OR PROGRESSED SINCE THEY 
BECAME OWNER LET'S JUDGE PEOPLE BY 
ACTIONS OR NOT FEARS OR RUMOURS 
LET'S GET TO A CUP FINAL WHAT DOES 
THAT MEAN FOR PORTSMOUTH TO WIN 
THIS NOW IN TERMS OF YOUR FUTURE 
AMBITION 
IT IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE AMBITION FOOTBALL CLUBS ARE BUILT ON HISTORY 
AND SILVERWARE THEY HAVE IN THE 
BOARDROOM WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC 
CUPS ARE THE PLACES WHERE WE CAN 
PERFORM 
HE BUILT A STRONG BOND PERFORM WITH HIS MANAGER AFTER PERSUADING 
REDKNAPP TO STAY EARLIER THIS

SIT DOWN AND DO THE FIGURES ASEN 
OUTSIDER LOOKING IN THERE'S A 
KIND OF FEELING ABOUT IT THIS YEAR 
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE TOP FOUR 
ARE NOT INVOLVED FOR A LONG TIME 
THE ROMANCE IS BACK THE GLORY 
THAT HOW MUCH IT MEANS IT IS NOT 
KOOMPTIGS THAT'S CONSAITING FOR A 
POOR SEASON IT IS A CHANCE FOR 
CLUBS TO MAKE HISTORY 
SOME ELDERLY 
FANS 
A CARDIFF FAN NINETY SEVEN YEAR OLD FANS DAVID MORGAN WHO WAS AT THE FINAL 
BACK IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN THE OVERWHELM TIME 
CARDIFF WON IT HE WILL BE AT THE 
GAME TODAY THREE YEARS SHY OF HIS 
CENTURY 
YOU'RE WATCHING BREAKFAST FROM B. B. C. 
NEWS THE HEADLINES FOR THE FIRST 
TIME CHINA IS ALLOWING FOREIGN 
RESCUE WORKERS INTO THE COUNTRY TO 
HELP IN THE SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS OF 
MONDAY'S EARTHQUAKE CUTTING DOWN 
ON PLASTIC BAGS BUT NOW 
SUPERMARKETS ARE ACCUSED OF 
DIVERTING ATTENTION AWAY FROM MORE 
SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
AND STILL TO COME HOW TO GET THE 
LATEST SOFTWARE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR 
YOUR COMPUTER WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY 
FOR IT 
BEFORE THAT THE WEATHER 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S PERHAPS 
GOOD FOR THE GARDENS BUT NOT SO 
GREAT IF YOU HAVE AN F. A. CUP FINAL 
TO WATCH OR THE CRICKET YES THERE 
WILL BE SOME RAIN AROUND TODAY 
THERE IS LAIN ACROSS THE CENTRAL 
BELT OF SCOTLAND AND QUITE WET TOO 
FOR THE NORTH OF WALES AND THE 
SOUTH WEST OF WALES AND IN THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND THERE ARE 
SOME LIVELY ONPOURS JUST PUSHING 
INTO DEVON AT PRESENT SO IT WILL 
BE A DAMP START FOR MANY OF US AND 
FOR THE VAST MAJORITY A RATHER 
GREY AND CLOUDY ONE A LITTLE 
BRIGHTNESS FOR A TIME ACROSS 
NORTHERN SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND WHILE THERE WILL BE 
SOME CLOUD ACROSS THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND IT WILL EASE OFF LATER IN 
THE DAY FOR ALL OF US A COOLER 
DAY WITH TEMPERATURES WELL DOWN ON 
THIS TIME LAST WEEKEND TOMORROW 
FRESH START BUT COMPARED WITH 
TODAY MUCH DRIER AND BRIGHTER AND 
THERE WILL BE SOME SUNSHINE AROUND 
NOW CLICK LOOKS AT HOW YOU CAN GET 
THE LATEST SOFTWARE FOR YOUR 
COMPUTER FOR FREE 
O. K. YOU HAVE A TEAM OF ONE HUNDRED 
PROGRAMMERS WORKING FLAT OUT FOR 
TWO YEARS TO BRING YOU FULLY 
FUNCTION PIECE OF SOFT I. A. OF 
COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO 
CHARGE YOU MONEY FOR IT AREN'T 
THEY 
WELCOME TO CLICK I'M SPENCER KELLY 
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY YOU'RE SKINT 
NO MORE MONEY FOR THE LATEST 
TECHNOLOGY I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL 
STAYING AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF HIGH 
TECH IS AN EXPENSIVE BUSINESS BUT 
IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO BUY THE VERY 
LATEST P. C. YOU MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW 
YOU DON'T ONE TO PAY THROUGH THE NOSE 
TO LOAD IT UP WITH USEFUL SOFTWARE 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THROUGH THE 
NOSE NOSE FOR YEARS BUYING SOFTWARE HAS BEEN 
LED BY BUYING THE LATEST SOFTWARE 
BUT NOW YOU CAN GET CHEAPER 
ALTERNATIVE WINDOWS IS 
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE COST OF 
NEW SYSTEM SO NOT BUYING WITH IT 
BE THE MACHINE CAN SAVE YOU PACKET PACKET FOR THE PAST YEAR DELL HAS BEEN 
SELLING SYSTEMS PREINSTALLED WITH 
LYNOX WHICH IS ALTERNATIVE AND 
FREE LYNOX IS THE BASIS FOR A VAST 
ARRAY OF OTHER TECH YODGES FOR 
INSTANCE UBUNTU THAT HAS FOUND 
SIGNIFICANT FOLLOWING BECAUSE OF 
ITS EASE OF USE PAY FOR FREE 
SOFTWARE MIGHT SOUND STRANGE BUT 
THE LICENCE UNDERSTAND WHICH THIS 
SOFTWARE IS DISTRIBUTED DOES ALLOW 
COMPANIES TO MAKE MONEY OUT OF IT 
IT IS WORTH REMEMBERING THAT THE 
PROGRAMMERS CREATING THESE OPEN 
SOURCE ALTERNATIVES ARE COMPETING 
DIRECTLY WITH WINDOWS SO IT IS 
OFTEN WORTH MAKING THE ENVIRONMENT 
LOOK FAMILIAR TO EASE THAT 
TRANSITION APART FROM MICROSOFT'S 
PROPRIETY IN BRANDS UBUNTO SEEMS 
TO EMULATE THE WINDOWS EXPERIENCE 
AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE SO A LYNOX 
SYSTEM IS WELL WORTH CONSIDERING 
BUT IT IS COMPLEX WAY OF SAVING 
MONEY THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF 
FREE SOFTWARE TO PICK FROM 
REGARDLESS OF WHICH O. S. YOU CHOOSE 
LET'S START OF THE BEGINNING 
YOU'VE JUST BOUGHT BRAND NEW 
COMPUTER AND ALTHOUGH YOU'VE JUST 
SHELLED OUT YOUR CASH IT IS STILL 
NOT LOADED WITH ALL THE SOFTWARE 
YOU NEED SO HOW DO YOU GET THE 
BASICS ON THE CHEAP TO BROWSE THE 
WEB YOU HAVE LOTS OF OPTIONS 
ALTHOUGH MICROSOFT'S INTERNET 
EXPLORER IS FREE TO DOWNLOAD IT IS 
FREE TO INTER NET USERS ONE OF THE 
MOST POPULAR PRODUCERS IS FIREFOX 
AND FOLLOWED BY SAFARI AND THEN 
OPERA 
WEB BROWSERS HAVE BEEN ONE OPERA OF THE MOST INTERESTING AREAS FOR 
WHERE FREE SOFTWARE HAS MANAGED TO 
INNOVATE WHAT HAS HAPPENED FOR A 
LONG TIME IS THAT MICROSOFT HAS 
BEEN SO DOMINANT IN THE COMMERCIAL 
BROWSER MARKET THERE HAS NOT BEEN 
ANY ROOM FOR ALTERNATIVES SO IT 
HAS BEEN LEFT TO ENTHUSIASTS AND 
THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY TO TAKE 
AREAS WHERE THEY THINK BROWSERS 
COULD BE IMPROVED AND PUT THAT INTO 
THEIR OWN PRODUCTS SO IF WE'RE 
LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE TABBED 
BROWSING AND POP UP BLOCKING AND 
AUTOCOMPLETING OF FORMS THESE ARE 
INNOVATIONS WE SAW FIRST OF ALL IN 
FREE SOFTWARE BUT THEN PICKED UP 
SPECIFICALLY BY MICROSOFT AND THE 
WIDER COMMUNITY 
SO REGARDLESS OF 
WHICH OPERATING SYSTEM YOU'VE 
PICKED THERE IS AN ARRAY OF 
BROWSERS TO CHOOSE FROM EACH ONE 
PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF BROWSING 
TECHNOLOGY BUTET WILL'S NOT GET 
CARRIED AWAY HERE USING A MACHINE 
CONNECTED TO THE NET MAKES YOU 
VULNERABLE TO ATTACK SO PROTECTING 
YOUR WITH ANTIVIRAL SOFTWARE IS A 
MOST A. V. G. IS A POPULAR ONE AND IT 
IS FREE FOR HOME USERS THE COMPANY 
MAKES ITS MONEY BY SELLING SERVICES 
TO SMALL BUSINESSES SO EVEN AS A 
NON PAYING USER YOU'LL GET REGULAR 
UPDATES 
SOMETHING LIKE A. V. G. IS UPDATES EXACTLY EFFECTIVE BUT THERE ARE 
MANY MANY MORE PRODUCTS THAT 
PRETEND TO BE FREE ANTI VIRUS OR 
SPY WEAR PROTECTORS AND WHAT 
THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE EITHER 
INSTALLING IT THEMSELVES OR JUST 
DETECTING IT AND THEN ASKING YOU TO 
PAY FOR SOMETHING TO REMOVE IT AND 
THAT'S NOT VERY HELPFUL AND IS JUST 
CYNICAL IF YOU'RE TRYING TO RUN 
YOUR MACHINE FOR FREE 
NOW THE 
BEST VALUE FREE WARE WE CAN FIND 
OPEN OFFICE IS AN ALTERISH TO 
MICROSOFT IT IS A FAIRLY HEFTY 
DOWNLOAD BUT IT GIVES YOU A SPREAD 
SHEET DATA WEAR AND PRESENTATION 
PROGRAMMES AND ALL CAN READ AND 
SAVE IN MICROSOFT'S OFFICE SUITE 
ALL ALAN IS EDITOR OF A COMPUTER 
MAGAZINE AND HE'S A SEASONED EDITOR 
OF FREE SOFTWARE 
WHY DO PEOPLE DEDICATE THEIR TIME 
TO WRITING SOFTWARE AND THEN GIVE 
IT AWAY FREE 
I THINK IT IS PARTLY 
BECAUSE OF THE KUDOS THEY LIKE TO 
SEE SOMETHING THEY'VE SPENT A LOT 
OF TIME ON OUTCLASSING SOMETHING 
FROM SAY MICROSOFT AND THEY LIKE 
THE COMMENTS FROM THE USERS AS WELL 
BUT WE ALSO SEE BIG COMPANIES 
RELEASING FEELY FEATURING SOFTWARE 
WHAT IS THE THING WILL THEY SELL 
ME THINGS OR PUT ADVERTS ON ONE THAT 
A WAY THEY MAKE MONEY 
THERE IS 
SOME DATA THEY WILL TRY TO UPDATE 
OR INCLUDE AND OTHER COMPANIES 
WILL ADD SPY WEAR IN THE DOWNLOAD 
SO THE BEST ADVICE IS IF YOU ARE 
GOING TO CHOOSE TO TAKE FREE 
DOWNLOADS GO TO A REPUTABLE SITE 
AND WHEN YOU GET THERE IF THERE IS 
A TERMS AND CONDITIONS SECTION 
HAVE A QUICK READ THROUGH IT AND 
MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT TICKING BOXES 
WHICH SAYS THE KPLS CAN SELL ON 
YOUR DETAILS AFTERWARDS COMPANIES CAN SELL ON YOUR DETAILS 
AFTERWARDS SO THOUGH THOSE ARE A 
FEW PIT FALLS TO AVOID BUT THERE 
ARE STILL PLENTY OF APPLICATIONS 
AROUND ON LINE WHICH SAY THEY'LL DO 
A GREAT JOB FOR NOTHING SO WHICH 
TO CHOOSE 
HERE'S MARK WITH CLICKS PICK 
WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT FREE 
SECURITY PRODUCTS IN THE FORM OF 
ANTI VIRUS EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME 
NOW HERE'S A FIRE WALL ZONE ALARM 
WHICH SHOULD HELP TO PREVENT 
INTRUSIONS INTO YOUR MACHINE IT 
ACTS LIKE A VIRTUAL F. B. I. PROFILER 
IT LEARNS ALL THE OTHER SOFTWARE ON 
YOUR MACHINE AND IF ANY OF THAT 
STARTS TO ACT UNUSUALLY SENDING OR 
RECEIVING DATA WHEN IT SHOULDN'T BE 
THAT IS WHEN THE FIRE WALL KICKS IN 
NOVICE USERS SHOULD FIND THE 
ONSCREEN INSTRUCTIONS FAIRLY EASY 
TO FOLLOW WITH SLIDERS TO SET THE 
PREFERRED LEVEL OF SECURITY BEWARE 
SETTING TOO HIGH CAN SOMETIMES LEAD 
TO POP UP WINDOWS ASKING FOR 
ANSWERS ON SOME OF THE SIMPLEST OF 
DECISION BUT IT IS SECURE ENOUGH TO 
BUST EVEN THE SNEAKIEST ATTACKS ON 
YOUR SYSTEM ORGANISING ALL YOUR 
DIGITAL MUSIC CAN PROVE TO BE FIVE 
PAIN IF YOU DON'T BOTHER TO USE A 
MEDIA MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE THIS 
BRINGS ME TO OUR NEXT PICK A

MILLION PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS 
THERE'S GROWING ANGER ABOUT WHY SO 
MANY SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS 
FAILED TO WITHSTAND THE EARTHQUAKE 
AS THE HOURS WEAR ON THE CHANCES 
OF FINDING SOMEONE ANYONE ALIVE 
ARE RARE BUT STILL THEY EMERGE 
THIS ELDERLY WOMAN PULLED FROM THE 
RUBBLE SHE THANKS A HIGHER POWER

FIRMLY ON THOSE STRUGGLING WITH THE 
AFTERMATH THESE THREE SHEETS OF

THE GOVERNMENT WILL HELP HER 
TAKING CARE OF HER AND THE 
REMAINING SURVIVORS IS NOW WHAT 
MATTERS 
GORDON BROWN ACCUSED THE BURMESE 
REGIME OF INHUMAN TREATMENT BY 
PREVENTING AID TO GET THROUGH TO 
THE SURVIVORS OF THE CYCLONE HE 
TOLD THE B. B. C. THE BURMESE GENERALS 
SHOULD BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR THE 
INTOLERABLE SITUATION 
OFFICIAL ESTIMATES PUT THE NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE DEAD OR MISSING AT 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND B. B. C. IS PREVENTED FROM 
REPORTING INSIDE BURMA OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IS IN NEIGHBOURING 
THAILAND THAILAND GOOD MORNING GIVE US AS BEST YOU 
CAN A PICTURE OF WHAT THE 
SITUATION IS IN BURMA NOW WELL WELL WHAT THE INTERNATIONAL RELIEF 
AGENCIES TELL US IS THAT EXACTLY A 
FORTNIGHT AFTER THE STORM HIT THE 
SITUATION IN THE IRRAWADDY DELTA 
WHICH IS A HUGE AREA THE SIZE OF 
AUSTRIA IS STILL DIRE FOR THOSE 
PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED THIS STORM 
MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM 
WERE DISPLACED TENS OF THOUSANDS 
ARE MISSING THOUSANDS TENS OF 
THOUSANDS INJURED TOO THE AID 
AGENCIES ARE FINDING IT HARD TO GET 
AID TO THE PEOPLE MOST IN NEED 
THEY REACHED ALL BUT A FEW POCKETS 
OF THAT AREA BUT STILL THE ROADS 
ARE ALMOST IMPASSABLE THE WEATHER 
HAS BEEN TERRIBLE A LOT OF THE 
FARMLAND IS RUINED IT WILL BE 
DIFFICULT TO GET THE FARMERS BACK 
ON THEIR FEET THANKFULLY THESE ARE 
PEOPLE WHOSE LIVELIHOODS HAVE BEEN 
SWEPT AWAY THEY SAY IT WILL BE 
DIFFICULT SWUNS THE EMERGENCY 
RELIEF PHASE OF THIS OPERATION IS 
FINISHED TO GO INTO THE NEXT STAGE 
WHICH IS HELPING PEOPLE TO REBUILD 
THEIR LIVES 
IT APPEARS THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES NOW UPPING THE FIGURES 
THEY SEEM TO BE ACKNOWLEDGING SOME 
OF THE SEVERITY OF IT GORDON BROWN 
ROUNDING ON THEM THE UN HAS SAID 
THEY NEED TO TAKE IN AID AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE AND YET BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT WILL NOT RELENT IN ANY 
SENSE 
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK SENSE YOU'VE GOT GORDON BROWN THE PRIME 
MINISTER MAKING VERY CLEAR IN HIS 
B. B. C. INTERVIEW REPEATING THE PHRASE 
AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT A NATURAL 
DISASTER IS TURNING INTO A MAN MADE 
CATASTROPHE HE IS SEEKING TO RAMP 
UP THE PRESSURE ON THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT HE SAYS THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NEEDS TO 
WORK TOGETHER AND TO KEEP THIS 
PRESSURE UP IT NEEDS TO BE 
CONCERTED PRESSURE BECAUSE THE 
BEST WAY TO HELP PEOPLE IS TO 
PERSUADE THE GENERALS TO ACCEPT 
MORE AID HE DOESN'T RULE OUT WITH 
AID DROPS BUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE 
WAY TO DO THIS IS GOING TO BE 
PERSUADING THE BURMESE 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH FOR THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY ON PLASTIC BAGS 
IS ALLOWING SUPERMARKETS TO PASS 
THE BUCK FOR CUTTING WASTE ON TO 
SHOPPERS THAT'S ACCORDING TO ONE 
OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN ADVISERS 
PROFESSOR CHRIS COGGINS SAYS THE 
FOCUS ON CARRIER BAGS IS DIVERTING 
THE ATTENTION ON TO FAR MORE 
PRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS 
AND CONFUSING CUSTOMERS IF YOU'RE 
DOING A SUPERMARKET SHOP THIS 
WEEKEND YOU MAY NOTICE A 
DIFFERENCE AT THE TILLS SINGLE 
USED PLASTIC BAGS ARE IN SHORT 
SUPPLY WITH MARKS AND AMP SPENCERS 
CHARGING AND OTHER RETAILERS USING 
INCENTIVES TO GET US TO REDUCE THE 
TWELVE POINT FIVE BILLION WE USE EVERY YEAR WHY 
SO MUCH ATTENTION ON THE BAG GUN 
GOVERNMENT ADVISERS THINKS THE 
GOVERNMENT'S OVERREACTING TO A 
RELATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT PROBLEM 
AND SUPERMARKETS ARE PASSING THE 
BUCK TO CUSTOMERS 
THEY HAVE 
PURCHASING POWER THEY HAVE POWER 
IN TERMS WHAT THEY BUY AND HOW IT 
IS PACKED THE PROBLEM IS IN A 
SENSE BY FOCUSING ON THE CONSUMER 
END THEY ARE TO SOME EXTENT 
DIVERTING ATTENTION WHAT THEY 
SHOULD BE DOING PUBLIC SEE PLASTIC 
BAGS AS AN ISSUE BUT THEY ARE A 
SMALL PROPORTION OF THE WASTE 
THEY'RE A SMALL PROPORTION OF OIL 
THEY USE SO IN OVERALL RESOURCE 
TERMS IT IS A VISUAL THING RATHER 
THAN A MAINSTREAM ISSUE THE THE GOVERNMENT'S PUT PRESSURE ON 
RETAILERS AND SUPERMARKETS GIVING 
THEM AN ULTIMATUM TO REDUCE PLASTIC 
BAG USE BY A QUARTER OR FACE TAXES 
IT IS MAKING PROVISION FOR A BAG 
TAX IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE BILL 
GOING THROUGH PARLIAMENT NOW 
RETAILERS SAY FOCUSING ON BAGS IS 
WASTING THEIR TIME 
THERE ARE A LOT 
OF VERY IMPORTANT PROVISIONS WITHIN 
THE CLIMATE CHANGE BILL THAT WE DO 
SUPPORT WE THINK THIS IS A RATHER 
TRIVIAL ISSUE TO ADD ON TO IT IT'S 
NOT JUST A SLEDGEHAMMER IT IS USE 
AGO STEAM ROLLER TO CRACK A WALL 
NUT IT ISN'T THE BEST USE OF OUR 
RESOURCENESS TERMS OF ALL THE 
ISSUES WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING 
THIS WASTE HERE IS DESTINED FOR 
LANDFILL SITES BUT LESS THAN TWO PER CENT OF 
WHAT GOES NOON LANDFILL IS MADE UP 
OF PACKAGING AND TINY FRACTION IS 
MADE UP OF PLASTIC BAGS THE 
GOVERNMENT ADMITS THAT TAXING 
PLASTIC BAGS IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE 
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON VOLUMES OF 
WASTE BUT IT SAYS THAT'S NOT THE 
POINT 
WE KNOW THE PUBLIC IS ON OUR POINT SIDE THEY WANT ACTION IT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT TO TAKE THAT ACTION IT 
MAY BE A SMALL PART OF THE WASTE 
STREAM BUTS SYMBOLIC OF OUR THROW 
AWAY SOCIETY WE NEED TO DO 
SOMETHING DRAMATICALLY TO CURB 
THEIR USE 
THE GOVERNMENT MAY HOPE 
PLASTIC BAG GUILT WILL MAKE US ALL 
BECOME MORE ECO FRIENDLY BUT 
WHATEVER THE MOTIVES OR THE 
CRITICISM REDUCING THEIR USE AND 
THE EYESORE THEY CAUSE CAN BE NO 
BAD THING IN A FEW MINUTES' TIME 
WE WILL SPEAK TO THE SUPERMARKET 
MORRISONS WHO WILL BE GIVING AWAY 
REUSABLE PLASTIC BAGS A SIX YEAR 
OLD GIRL THAT IS BEEN KILLED IN A 
SUSPECTED HIT AND RUN ON MERSEYSIDE 
SHE WAS WALKING WHEN SHE WAS

GOOD MORNING IT SHOULD BE SOME DAY 
FOR THE NINETY THOUSAND FANS FOR WEMBLEY 
THE F. A. CUP FINAL ALWAYS ONE OF THE 
HIGHLIGHTS OF THE SPORTING CALENDAR 
BUT THIS ONE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT 
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK EVEN THE MOST 
OPTIMISTIC PORTSMOUTH OR CARDIFF 
FAN EXPECTED THEIR TEAM TO GET THIS 
FAR ONE OF THE UNLIKIST F. A. CUP 
FINALS OF RECENT YEARS THE FANS 
THE LONG WAIT IS NEARLY OVER STOO

LAST F. A. CUP FINAL AND WHILE THEY

TO ACTUALLY TO BE GOING TO WEMBLEY 
NOW LEADING A TEAM OUT IN THE CUP 
FINAL IS FANTASTIC POMPEY FANS TO 
BE GO THERE TO GO TO THE SEMIS AND 
NOW TIME IT WILL BE A GREAT DAY 
FANS CAN EXPECT A HEAVY POLICE 
PRESENCE AROUND WEMBLEY 
PARTICULARLY AFTER THE PROBLEMS OF 
THE UEFA CUP FINAL IN MANCHESTER 
BUT FOR THE PLAYERS THIS IS A 
CHANCE TO GRAB A PIECE OF SPORTING 
HISTORY YES IT SHOULD BE SOME DAY 
FOR THE FANS HERE AS FOR THE MATCH 
ITSELF WELL PORTSMOUTH WILL START 
AS FAVOURITES THEY ARE THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE SIDE BUT THIS YEAR'S 
TOURNAMENT HAS BEEN FULL OF 
SURPRISES AND WHO KNOWS CARDIFF 
MAY BRING ANOTHER ONE 
WATCH THE MATCH 
THIS AFTERNOON THREE P. M. LIVE ON B. B. C. 
ONE ONE NOW THE QUEEN'S ELDEST GRANDCHILD 
WILL GET MARRIED TODAY AT SAINT 
GEORGE'S CHAPEL IN WINDSOR PETER 
PHILLIPS WILL WED AUTUMN KELLY THE 
BRIDE HAS GIVEN UP HER CATHOLIC 
FAITH TO ALLOW HER FIANCE TO RETAIN 
HIS PLACE AS ELEVENTH IN THRONE NOW 
MANY SUPERMARKETS TRY TO ENCOURAGE 
CUSTOMERS TO REUSE THEIR CARRIER 
BAGS SOME EVEN CHARGE THEM FOR T. 
BUT JUST HOW SERIOUS A THREAT TO 
THE ENVIRONMENT IS PLASTIC BAGS OR 
IS ATTENTION DIVERTED AWAY FROM 
MORE SERIOUS ISSUES A VERY GOOD 
MORNING TO YOU WE'RE SEEING A 
NUMBER OF SUPERMARKETS TRYING TO 
TACKLE THE SCOURGE OF PLASSTG BAGS 
IN DIFFERENT WAYS SOME ARE 
CHARGING FOR THEM AND SOME ARE 
GIVING AWAY REUSABLE BAGS DO YOU 
THINK THE TIME EFFORT AND MONEY 
FOCUSED ON PLAS STIC BAGS IS WELL 
SPENT 
IT IS A SMALL PART OF A BIG SPENT PROBLEM SUPERMARKETS ARE 
INCREDIBLY POU POWERFUL THERE'S A 
HUGE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE 
GOODS THEY BUY IN THE PACKAGING ON 
THE THINGS THEY BUY AND WHERE THEY 
PUT THEIR SUPERMARKETS FOR EXAMPLE 
IF THEY'RE ON THE BIG OUT OF SITE 
THAT HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON THE 
ENVIRONMENT ALTHOUGH PACKAGING AND 
BAGS ARE WORTH SORTING OUT WE 
SHOULDN'T CONGRATULATE THE 
SUPERMARKET AND SAY WELL DONE IT'S 
A TINY PART OF IT 
THE CONSUMERS 
ATTENTION IS DIVERTED FROM THIS 
ISSUE THAT LOOKING LIKE YOU'RE 
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT PLASTIC BAGS 
LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING 
BIG FOR THE ENVIRONMENT 
WE HEARD 
THE MINISTER SAYING THIS WAS 
SYMBOLIC IT IS SIM BOGGIC IN THAT 
WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE 
WHOLE ENVIRONMENT THE GOVERNMENT 
ARE TALKING A TAX ON PLASTIC BAGS 
BUT MEANWHILE WE'RE GETTING COAL 
FIRED POWER STATIONS AND AIRPORT 
EXPANSIONS THESE WILL HAVE A HUGE 
IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT SO 
AGAINST THAT BACKDROP THEY'RE TINY 
PLAS STACK BAGS MAKE UP A TINY 
PROPORTION WHAT GOES INTO LANDFILL 
AND ACTUALLY SOME CUSTOMERS FEEL 
GUILTY ABOUT THEM AT THE SAME TIME 
THE SUPERMARKETS THEMSELVES ARE 
ENCASING SO MANY OF THE PRODUCTS IN 
PLASTIC PACKAGILING DO YOU THINK 
THE SUPERMARKETS ARE LET OFF THE 
HOOK IN TERMS OF PACKAGING AND 
GUILT TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMERS 
AND THEIR PLASTIC BAG USE I I CERTAINLY THINK PACKAGE SOMETHING A 
BIGGER ISSUE THAN BAGS YOU SEE A 
PINEAPPLE WRAPPED ON A TRAY CAN 
CLING FILM NATURE PACKAGED IT 
PERFECTLY WELL AND SUPERMARKET AS 
A WHOLE NEED TO GET A GRIP ON THE 
BIGGER ISSUE WHEN THEY DO WANT TO 
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO CHANGE 
BEHAVIOUR PEOPLE SHOULD BE 
REWARDED AND ENCOURAGED NOT FINED 
ALL THE TIME IF WE WANT TO SEE THE 
ENVIRONMENT POSITIVE THING THEY 
SHOULDN'T ALWAYS BE PENALISED WE 
NEED ENSENTIVES 
HOW DOES THE 
GOVERNMENT GET THE SUPERMARKETS TO 
DO THAT WITHOUT IT IS INTERFERING 
WITH THE SUPERMARKETS SOMETIMES SOMETIMES GOVERNMENT NEED TO MAKE PEOPLE DO 
THINGS THEY CHARGE TAXES ON THINGS 
LIKE LANDFILL SO I DON'T HAVE A 
PROBLEM WITH THE SUPERMARKETS GIVEN 
STRONG INCENTIVES TO CHANGE THEIR 
BEHAVIOUR AND CONSUMER POWER IS 
VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL WE NEED TO 
SAY TO THE SUPERMARKETS TAKING THE 
PROTEST AT THE CHECKOUTS IT WAS 
THE W. I. PUT AGO DAY IN THE EXCESS 
PACKAGING AT THE CHECKOUT WE NEED 
TO STEP UP THE PRESSURE THE 
SUPERMARKETS THINK WE'RE TACKLING 
IT WHEN THERE'S A BIGGER ISSUE 
THE HEADLINES FOR THE FIRST TIME 
CHINA IS ALLOWING FOREIGN RESCUE 
WORKERS INTO THE COUNTRY TO HELP IN 
THE SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS OF 
MONDAY'S EARTHQUAKE CUTTING DOWN 
ON PLASTIC BAGS BUT NOW 
SUPERMARKETS ARE ACCUSED OF 
DIVERTING ATTENTION AWAY FROM MORE 
SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
AND STILL TO COME HOLIDAY PRICE 
HIKE WHERE SOME TRAVEL COMPANIES 
ARE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY THAT 
CUSTOMERS THOUGHT THEY HAD ALREADY 
PAID FOR AND IT IS LEGAL 
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY HOLIDAY WEATHER 
THIS WEEKEND IS IT LET'S SEE WHAT 
THE WEATHER HAS IN STORE 
YES GOOD MORNING IT IS A GREY 
START TO SATURDAY AND THERE WILL BE 
DAMP WEATHER AROUND TOO NOT 
EVERYWHERE WILL SEE THAT BUT THERE 
ARE VERY FEW PLACES I CAN GUARANTEE 
WILL STAY DRY TODAY EXCEPT THE 
NORTH WEST OF SCOTLAND BUT THERE 
WILL BE RAIN IN CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN SCOTLAND AND LIVIER 
DOWNPOURS WILL DEVELOP IN ENGLAND 
ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH EAST AND 
SOUTH WEST AND NOT JUST THIS 
MORNING ALL THE WAY INTO THE 
AFTERNOON HEAVY THUNDERSTORMS AND 
EVEN HAIL POSSIBLE OUT THERE AND 
IT WILL FEEL COOL IN A BRISK NORTH 
EASTERLY WIND 
IN WALES SOME BRIGHTNESS HERE AND 
THERE BUT HIT AND MISS SHOWERS AND 
GENERALLY CLOUDY AND CLOUD OVER 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND THAT COULD 
PRODUCE ONE OR TOO SHOWERS AND IT 
WILL BE COOL AT FOURTEEN CELSIUS IN 
SCOTLAND THINGS SHOULD BE LARGELY 
DRY THIS AFTERNOON CLOUDY IN THE 
WEST THE NORTH AND THE EAST 
BRITENING UP AND TEMPERATURES 
AROUND NINE OR TEN CELSIUS A BIT 
MORE BRIGHTNESS IN THE NORTH EAST 
OF ENGLAND BUT THE FURTHER WEST 
AND SOUTH WE COME THE MORE RAIN 
THERE WILL BE WHICH COULD BE HEAVY 
AT TIMES THERE SHOULDN'T BE TOO 
MUCH DISRUPTION FOR THE PLAYERS 
THIS AFTERNOON AT WEMBLEY AND 
THERE WILL BE INTERRUPTIONS 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY AT LORDS 
THROUGH THE NIGHT THE SKIES CLEAR 
BUT UNDER THE CLEARING SKIES 
TEMPERATURES WILL TAKE A DIP AND 
WILL BECOME LOW ENOUGH OVER PARTS 
OF NORTH OF ENGLAND FOR SOME GRASS 
FROST AND IN SCOTLAND THERE COULD 
BE AN AIR FROST AND THE REASON FOR 
THAT IS BECAUSE THE WINDS ARE DRAG 
IN FROM THE NORTH AND THAT WILL 
CONTINUE INTO SUNDAY THERE WILL 
STILL BE SOME SHOWERS LURKING 
AROUND IN THE CHANNEL SO 
PARTICULARLY FOR THE CHANNEL 
ISLANDS AND THE SOUTH WEST AND ON 
SUNDAY IT WILL BE FIVE FRESH START AND 
CLOUDY BUT LATER ON NOT BAD DAY 
BRIGHT AND BRIGHT FOR MOST OF US 
BUT TEMPERATURES JUST TWELVE TO SIXTEEN 
DEGREES A GOOD TEN TO FOURTEEN DEGREES 
LOWER THAN THIS TIME LAST WEEK 
SO A CLOUDY DAY FOR MOST OF US 
TODAY DRIER AND BRIGHTER TOMORROW 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY YEARS 
THOUSANDS OF HOLIDAY MAKERS ARE 
BEING ASKED TO STUMP UP MORE TO PAY 
FOR THEIR HOLIDAY THE TRAVEL 
OPERATORS SAY IT IS BECAUSE OF THE 
RISING COSTS OF FUEL AND THE 
DIFFERENT EXCHANGE RATES 
SUMMER HOLIDAYS THEY'RE ALL ABOUT 
SUN SAND AND SEA BUT THIS YEAR 
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE SURCHARGES 
SOME HOLIDAY COMPANIES ARE FORCING 
THEIR CUSTOMERS TO PAY MORE FOR 
THEIR SUMMER BREAK THEY BLAME IT 
ON THE STRENGTH OF THE EURO 
SO FAR TWENTY THREE HOLIDAY FIRMS ARE ASKING 
FOR EXTRA AND ABTA SAYS SEVERAL 
THOUSAND HOLIDAY MAKERS ARE BEING 
AFFECTED AT TIME WHEN MANY 
FAMILIES ARE FACING RISING COSTS 
ELSEWHERE IT IS A MOVE THAT IS NOT 
GOING DOWN WELL 
THE TRAVEL 
INDUSTRY IS THE ONLY ONE IN WHICH 
YOU CAN PAY FOR A PRODUCT YOU PAY 
FOR IT MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND THEN A 
MONTH BEFORE YOU'RE DUE TO AVAIL 
YOURSELF OF THAT PRODUCT OR SERVICE 
YOU'RE ASKED TO PAY EVEN MORE AND 
WE THINK THAT THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY 
REALLY SHOULD PUT THEIR HOUSE IN 
ORDER AND STOP PASSING SURCHARGES 
ON TO CONSUMERS 
SO WHAT CAN 
COMPANIES MAKE THEIR CUSTOMERS PAY 
UNDER ABTA'S RULES THEY CAN CHARGE 
UP TO TEN PER CENT EXTRA ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE 
TO ABSORB THE FIRST TWO PER CENT THEY CAN 
ASK FOR EXTRA MONEY TO COVER THINGS 
LIKE THE COST OF AIRLINE FUEL AND 
AIRPORT TAXES AND CURRENCY 
FLUCTUATIONS BUT THEY CAN'T ASK 
FOR THE MONEY IF IT IS LESS THAN THIRTY 
DAYS BEFORE DEPARTURE THE BIGGEST 
TOUR OPERATORS INCLUDING THOMAS 
COOK AND TUI WHICH OWNS FIRST 
CHOICE SAY THEY WON'T CHARGE EXTRA 
BUT MANY OTHERS HAVE NOT GIVEN THIS 
GUARANTEE 
PROVIDING THAT THE GUARANTEE COMPANY IN QUESTION HAS CLEARED 
WITH ABTA THAT THEY CAN CHARGE A 
SURCHARGE PROVIDING THEY HAVE 
ABSORBED THE FIRST TWO PER CENT YOU REALLY 
HAVE NO CHOICE BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T 
PAID FOR YOUR HOLIDAY IN FULL 
HOLIDAYS ARE ALWAYS EXPENSIVE SO 
EVEN IF YOU ARE ASKED TO PAY A 
SURCHARGE OF FIVE FEW PER CENT EXTRA 
IT CAN MAKE DENT IN YOUR MONEY 
WHICH MEANS YOU MIGHT HAVE TO CUT 
BACK ON YOUR PLANS WHEN YOU GET 
THERE THERE BUT SOME SMALLER TOUR OPERATORS 
BELIEVE THERE IS NO REASON TO MAKE 
CUSTOMERS PAY A SURCHARGE IN THE 
FIRST PLACE 
OVER THE LAST FOUR 
YEARS THE POUND HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY 
STRONG AND THEREFORE WE LIKE OTHER 
TOUR OPERATORS AND TRAVEL AGENCIES 
HAVE DONE INCREDIBLY WELL NOW THAT 
THE POUND HAS MOVED THE OTHER WAY 
I'M NOT CONVINCED IT IS THE RIGHT 
DECISION TO HEAD BACK TO OUR 
CLIENTS HOPING FOR THEM TO BAIL US 
OUT 
BUT THE TRAVEL CITY SAYS THAT OUT COMPANIES MUST HAVE THE OPTION OF 
SURCHARGES AND REJECTS THE 
SUGGESTION THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING 
OPEN 
YES IT IS OUT THERE IT OPEN MIGHT BE IN THE SMALL PRINT AT THE 
BACK OF THE BROCHURE BUT THERE ARE 
LOTS OF OTHER INFORMATION TUCKED IN 
THERE TOO THERE ARE LOTS OF RULES 
AND GUIDELINES AND THEY HAVE BEEN 
PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE 
CUSTOMER 
SO FAR MOST TRAVEL FIRMS CUSTOMER ARE NOT ADDING A SURCHARGE BUT 
THEY COULD STILL DO SO IN TIME FOR 
THE SUMMER ESPECIALLY IF THE POUND 
FALLS AGAIN AGAINST THE EURO AND 
WE'LL FIND OUT WHEN THE TRAVEL 
WRITER ALLISON WRIGHT MAKES OF THE 
SURCHARGES AFTER EIGHT A M. THIS MORNING 
AND TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS LAUREN 
BOOTH JOINS US HOW ARE YOU THIS 
MORNING 
VERY GOOD THAUNK YOU AND MORNING AND START BEING THE THANK YOU THERE 
IS A ROYAL WEDDING THIS MORNING 
ALTHOUGH NOT ONE THAT IS GETTING A 
HUGE AMOUNT OF COVERAGE AND THERE 
IS CHELSEA DAVEY THE GIRLFRIEND OF 
PRINCE HARRY AND SHE WILL BE 
INTRODUCED TO THE QUEEN FOR THE 
FIRST TIME AT THE WEDDING OF 
PHILLIPS AND AUTUMN 
AND THE DAILY EXPRESS THE NEW HOPE 
TO THE END OF THE SLUMP THE 
COUNTRY BEGAN ITS RECOVERY FROM THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH THEY SAY LAST NIGHT 
THEY SAY THERE ARE THE FIRST SIGNS 
OF AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE ECONOMY 
AND THE MIRROR HAS THE STORY OF FORTY SEVEN 
YEAR OLD POLICE CONSTABLE MICK 
REGAN WHO WAS ATTACKED BY MOB OF 
FOOTBALL HOOLIGANS DURING THE MATCH 
ON WEDNESDAY AND ONE OF THE 
STORIES WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS 
MORNING WHICH IS THE EXTRAORDINARY 
FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE STILL 
BEING BROUGHT ALIVE FROM THE RUBBLE 
ONE HUNDRED HOURS AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE 
STRUCK IN CHINA A FACTORY WORKER 
WAS PULLED FROM THE RUBBLE AND 
SHALL WE START WITH THAT STORY 
LAUREN BECAUSE THESE STORIES 
EXTRAORDINARY 
I THINK THEY ARE NECESSARY AS WELL 
ABOUT PEOPLE BEING FOUND ONE HUNDRED HOURS 
AFTER THE QUAKE AND WHY ARE THEY 
IMPORTANT TO KEEP US FOCUSED ON 
THE COUNTRY AND THERE IS ALSO THE 
STORY OF MIRACLES ON THE INSIDE 
PAGES THERE IS THE CASE OF A 
DAUGHTER WHO WOULD NOT LET HER 
FATHER GO AND CALLED THE TEAMS 
OVER TO GET HIM OUT ALTHOUGH THEY 
HAD TO AMPUTATE A LEG TO GET HIM 
OUT AND THERE ARE THE PICTURES OF 
THE SOLDIERS WHO ARE THERE AND WE 
HAVE TO KEEP GOING NO MATTER HOW 
GREAT A INFRASTRUCTURE OR NOT CHINA 
HAS YOU CANNOT GET TO THESE PLACES 
AND PEOPLE ARE CLAWING WITH THEIR 
HANDS 
IT IS THE NATURE OF THESE HANDS STORIES WE DO OF COURSE FOCUS ON 
THE MOMENTS WHEN THERE IS A GLIMMER 
OF HOPE AMONGST ALL THIS BUT WHAT 
IS ALSO EMERGING MORE AND MORE IS 
THE SCALE OF THE DEVASTATION THERE 
OVERWHELMING 
AND WE CAN'T REALLY OVERWHELMING COPE WITH THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS 
OF FUNERALS NOW STARTING TO HAPPEN 
AND PEOPLE GIVING UP HOPE SO LET'S 
JUST HOPE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY AND CHINA ITSELF KEEPS UP 
THE PRESSURE OVER WHO CAN BE FOUND 
TO BE SAVED 
AND A POLITICAL STORY 
CLOSER TO HOME THIS IS IN THE 
TIMES AND THERE WILL BE MORE 
OPENNESS ABOUT SECOND HOME EXPENSES 
NOT IF M. P.'S HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH 
IT PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING 
TO BLOCK ANY DISCLOSURE OF M. P.S' 
EXPENSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECOND 
HOMES AND THEY'VE FAILED THIS IS 
VERY EXCITING BECAUSE NEXT FRIDAY 
WE MIGHT FINALLY HAVE WON THE 
RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT GORDON BROWN'S 
EXPENSES ARE WHAT GEORGE OSBORNE'S 
EXPENSES AND HOW MUCH THEY ARE 
GETTING PAID TO RUN THE SECOND 
HOMES WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LIVING 
IN A DEMOCRACY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO 
BE WORKING FOR US AND IT IS 
TAXPAYERS' MONEY AND I THINK THIS 
WHOLE AFFAIR OF TRYING TO BLOCK IT 
HAS BEEN VERY VERY SHODDY IT'S 
REAL LOW POINT IN PUBLIC LIFE 
DON'T YOU THINK SNOOP 
WELL T. IS A 
MIXED THING SOME OF THE M. P.'S WHOSE 
DETAILS ARE DUE TO BE RELEASED HAVE 
BEEN FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND 
SAYING THEY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM 
WHO IS IT WHO DOESN'T WANT THEIR 
DETAILS OUT 
THE ARGUMENT THEY PUT 
FORWARD WAS ABOUT SECURITY THEY 
SAID WU HAVE TO INCLUDE THESE 
ADDRESSES YOU WOULD HAVE TO 
INCLUDE THESE ADDRESSES IN ORDER 
FOR THEM TO BE FULLY OPEN AND THE 
JUDGES DISMISSED THE ATTEMPT AS 
WHOLLY UNREASONABLE ON THE GROUNDS 
THAT IF YOU GO TO A LOCAL LIBRARY 
EVERYONE'S ADDRESSES CAN BE FOUND 
HEADS OF CORPATIONS THEIR 
ADDRESSES ARE PUBLIC IF YOU ARE IN 
THE BUSINESS OF PUBLIC SERVICES 
YOU HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE SO 
GOOD NET FRIDAY WE HAVE SOMETHING 
TO LOOK FORWARD TO 
AND FROM SECOND 
HOMES TO FIRST HOMES AND THIS IS A 
STORY IN THE NEWSPAPER THIS MORNING 
ABOUT CHERIE BLAIR'S ROOTS AND YOU 
SHOULD KNOW A FEW THINGS ABOUT 
THIS 
YES I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE THIS THE HEADLINE THE TRUTH ABOUT 
THOSE WORKING CLASS ROOTS AND IT 
SAYS THAT CHERIE BLAIR CAME FROM A 
GENT YEEL HOUSE WHERE PEOPLE HAD 
BUM PRAMS AND WALKED ALONG THE PROM 
NOT QUITE ACCURATE AND IN FACT 
VERY INACCURATE FOR CHERIE HERSELF 
IT IS A NICE AREA A POOR AREA THE 
OPENING OF THE BOOK CONCENTRATES ON 
CROSBY BUT IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE FROM 
SIX GENERATIONS IN A TINY HOUSE IT 
IS GOING TO BE A STRUGGLE AND AND LAUREN WHY YOU CAN SPEAK ABOUT 
THIS AUTHORITY 
YES I'M CHERIE 
BLAIR'S HALF SISTER 
YOU SHARE THE 
SAME FATHER 
AND GRANDMOTHER AND AND THIS IS HOME YOU VISIT INSTEAD 
YES AND WHEN I VISITED IT THE 
HOUSE IN FOREIGN DALE ROAD THIS 
WAS IN THE LATE SIX SIXTIES AND IN THIS 
LITTLE HOUSE THEY HAD MY UNCLE BOB 
CHERIE AND HER SISTER LINDSEY MY 
GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDFATHER THAT'S 
A LOT OF CHEFLING BETWEEN ROOMS AND 
A LOT OF CAMP BEDS AND THEY 
DEFINITELYY DIDN'T HAVE HEATING 
THEY HAD A LITTLE HEATER THAT THEY 
BROUGHT UP TO A ROOM ONLY WHEN 
SOMEBODY WAS ILL AND I KNOW HER 
MOTHER HAD A BICYCLE AND TOOK BUSES 
AND HAD NO MONEY AND YES SHE WAS 
POOR AND WORKING CLASS AND I THINK 
THE PROBLEM WITH THE COVERAGE IS 
THAT THERE IS SUCH A CAMPAIGN AN 
ALMOST AN INDUSTRY OF LOATHING 
AROUND CHERIE BLAIR AND IT SEEMS 
TO COME FROM THE FACT THAT SHE WAS 
NOT QUITE POOR ENOUGH AND IS TOO 
SMART BY HALF AND THIS IS NOT THE 
TRUTH AND I DON'T WANT MAIL READERS 
TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS NOT A 
WORKING CLASS GIRL AND READ THE 
BOOK TO FIND OUT 
IT IS INTERESTING 
TO HEAR YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
ALSO COMING UP IN THE PROGRAMME 
SHE IS ONE OF THE BOYS SHE CAN 
STAND HER GROUND

VERDICTS ON THE LADY SET TO BECOME

OVERREACTING TO THE PROBLEM PLASTIC 
BAGS POSE TO THE ENVIRONMENT 
ACCORDING TO ITS OWN ADVISER 
PROFESSOR CHRIS COGGINS SAYS THE 
FOCUS OF CARRIER BAGS IS DIVERTING

DO 
ENGLAND'S CRICKETERS WILL BE DO HOPING THE WEATHER DOESN'T HAMPER 
DAY THREE OF THE OPENING TEST AS 
THEY WANT TO BUILD A FIRST INNINGS 
LEAD AT LORDS SO FAR THE MATCH HAS

BEEN FOLLOWING IT FROM THE 
BEGINNING I LOVE IT YOU CAN 
UNDERSTAND THE FANS CLUBS WHO GET 
WORRIED SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE WE 
DON'T KNOW A LOT OF MONEY WILL 
THEY PULL OUT AT SOME POINT I I BELIEVE STATISTICALLY EVERY CLUB 
THAT IS IN THE HANDS OF A FOREIGN 
OWNER HAS DONE THE SAME OR 
PROGRESSED SINCE HE BECAME THE 
OWNER LET'S JUDGE PEOPLE FOR THEIR 
ACTIONS AND NOT BY FEARS OR BY ANY 
OTHER RUMOURS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT 
ENTERTAIN 
TO GET TO A CUP FINAL ENTERTAIN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHAT DOES IT 
MEAN FOR PORTSMOUTH TO WIN FOR THIS 
IN TERMS FOR YOUR FUTURE AMBITION 
IT IS CRUCIAL CLUBS ARE BUILT ON 
HISTORY AND THE AMOUNT OF 
SILVERWARE THEY HAVE IN THE 
BOARDROOM WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC 
CUPS ARE THE PLACES WHERE WE CAN 
PERFORM 
HE'S BUILT A STRONG BOND PERFORM WITH HIS MANAGER AFTER PERSUADING 
HARRY REDKNAPP TO STAY EARLIER THIS 
SEASON 
I CAN BE HAPPY WITH OUR SEASON MANAGER WE HAVE THE BEST MANAGER 
FOR A CLUB LIKE OURS AND IN GENERAL 
WE HAVE THE BEST MANAGER IN LAENGED 
NOW THEY'VE REACHED THE CUP TIME 
HOW QUICKLY CAN THEY MOVE FORWARD 
BREAK INTO THE TOP FOUR

GIVES ME TWO HUNDRED MILLION I CAN DO IT 
NO PROBLEM 
IF I CAN PUT PORTSMOUTH 
SHIRT ON HEN RY EIGHTH THEY CAN DO 
ANYTHING HE DIDN'T ANSWER THE

NOW NOW THE HEADLINES FOR THE FIRST TIME 
CHINA IS ALLOWING FOREIGN RESCUERS 
INTO THE COUNTRY TO HELP IN THE 
SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS OF MONDAY'S 
EARTHQUAKE CUTTING DOWN ON PLASTIC 
BAGS BUT NOW SUPERMARKETS ARE 
ACCUSED OF DIVERTING ATTENTION AWAY 
FROM MORE SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL 
ISSUES AND COMING UP DOING THE 
MIDNIGHT MOON WALK OUR VERY OWN DOCTOR 
ROSEMARY WILL BE HERE TO TELL US 
HOW SHE IS HELPING TO RAISE 
AWARENESS OF BREAST CANCER 
LET'S FIND OUT ABOUT THE WEEKEND 
WEATHER 
FROM THE SHORTS AND T. SHIRT WEATHER 
OF LAST WEEKEND TO THE JUMPERS OF 
THIS WEEKEND PLENTY OF COMPARISONS 
THE RAIN HAS BEEN FALLING OVER 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SCOTLAND AND 
NORTH WEST WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
OF WALES IN PARTICULAR BUT THE 
HEAVIEST THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BEEN 
OVER CORNWALL AND DEVON AND WILL 
REMAIN FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS 
AND EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE 
RAIN THIS MORNING IT IS CLOUDY 
GREY DAMP OLD MORNING 
HOWEVER THERE IS THE ODD GLIMMER 
OF SUNSHINE TO COME OVER THE NORTH 
EAST OF SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND THEN LATER IN THE DAY 
IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AS THE 
SHOWERS BECOME CONFINED TO THE 
SOUTH OF ENGLAND AND STILL 
POTENTIAL THUNDERSTORMS IN THE 
SOUTH WEST OF THE COUNTRY A CHILL 
CONTRARY START TO TOMORROW BUT 
BRIGHTENING UP AND SOME SUNSHINE 
FOR ALL OF US AND IT SHOULD BE DRY 
NOW NEWS WATCH WHICH ASKS WHY U. K. 
STORIES GET SHORT SHRIFT IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 
WELCOME TO SATISFY NEWS WATCH THIS 
WEEK THE MYSTERY OF WHAT HAPPENS 
TO YOUR NEWS IN THE SMALL HOURS OF 
THE MORTGAGE AND ORDERED TO BE 
HONEST HAVE B. B. C. JOURNALISTS 
LEARNT ANYTHING FROM THE TRUST IN 
BROADCASTING CRISIS 
DURING COVERAGE EARLIER THIS MONTH 
OF THE LONDON MAYORIAL ELECTION 
RESULTS VIEWERS WHO WERE STILL 
AWAKE AT ONE A M. HEARD SOMETHING 
UNUSUAL ON THE B. B. C. NEWS CHALLENGE 
KEN LIVINGSTONE WAS DEFEATED BY 
BORIN JOHN SON MR. JOHNSON WILL NOW 
OVERSEE A BUDGET OF TWO DOLLARS 
BILLIONS 
TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
WHAT WAS ALL THAT ABOUT THIS 
VIEWER HAD THIS TO STAY 
LONDON IS 
A BRITISH CITY THE BRITISH 
CURRENCY IS UNITED KINGDOM POUNDS 
OR STERLING 
IN FACT VIEWERS HAVE 
QUESTIONED THE B. B. C.'S OVER NIGHT 
SERVICE BEFORE IN FEBRUARY IT 
GOAT THE HARDLY ANY TIME TO AN 
EARTHQUAKE WHICH HIT LARGE PARTS OF 
THE U. K. ONE GROUP OF VIEWERS DIDN'T 
THINK MUCH OF THAT AND POSTED THEIR 
VIEWS ON YOUTUBE 
IT'S BEEN HALF AN HOUR SINCE IT 
HAPPENED AND IT IS NOT ON L. DON'T 
BELIEVE IT COME ON LADS THERE'S 
BEEN AN EARTHQUAKE FOR CRYING OUT 
LOUD TELL US WHAT HAPPENED WHAT'S 
THIS NOW 
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE'S BEEN AN 
EARTHQUAKE AND LOOK AT THIS MAN AND 
WOMAN WOMAN AT THE TIME WE WERE TOLD THAT B. B. C. 
NEWS IS SIMULCAST ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL CHANNEL B. B. C. WORLD 
NEWS SO A FEW TREMORS IN THE U. K. 
WOULD NOT BE BIG NEWS WITH 
COUNTRIES THAT HAD REAL EARTHQUAKE 
PROBLEMS BUT THAT VIEWER SAID 
KEVIN YOU ARE CONTROLLER OF THE 
B. B. C. NEWS CHANNEL HOW COME WE HAVE 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR BRITISH 
VIEWERS 
I THINK THE VIEWER IS VIEWERS RIGHT I THINK IT LOOKS LEAD CUS 
WHEN YOU'RE REPORTING ABOUT LONDON 
TO SEE DOLLARS AND I QUESTION WHY 
IT WAS DONE L. DID PHONE IN THE 
NIGHT TO SAY THAT WHEN IT WENT OVER 
TO AN INTERNATIONAL SERVICE WITH 
B. B. C. WORLD NEWS THAT WE WOULD GIVE 
A LOT OF COVERAGE TO THE LONDON 
MAYORAL ELECTIONS BUT I AGREE WITH 
THE VIEWER THAT WHEN WE'RE 
REPORTING BRITISH STORIES ON 
BRITISH TELEVISION WE SHOULD USE 
POUNDS 
HOW DO YOU GET THE BALANCE POUNDS RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE SHOWING THINGS TO 
AN INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE BUT THE 
BRITISH AUDIENCE SAY THEY'VE FUNDED 
IT WITH THEIR LICENCE FEE 
IT IS 
HARD TO GET THE BALANCE RIGHT AT 
TIMES FIRST OF ALL ON THE FUNDING 
POINT THE OVERNIGHT SERVICE IS 
LARGELY FUNDED BY THE LICENCE FEE 
BUT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT IS FUNDED 
FROM B. B. C. WORLD NEWS WHICH IS 
SEPARATELY FUNDED AND COMMERCIALLY 
FUNDED SO THEY HAVE A STAKE IN WHAT 
IS HAPPENING AND THAT IS WHY WE 
HAVE IT OVERNIGHT BECAUSE THE 
VIEWING FIGURES ARE GENERALLY MUCH 
LOWER AS FOR THE BALANCE I 
THINKING LOOKING BACK WE DID GET 
IT WRONG L. LOOKED BACK OVER THE 
BRITISH EARTHQUAKE AND I THINK WE 
DIDN'T GET IT RIGHT AND THERE ARE 
SUGGESTIONS THAT IT SHOULDN'T 
HAPPEN AGAIN 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE 
CHANCES TO INTERRUPT AN 
INTERNATIONAL STORY WHEN THERE IS A 
BREAKING STORY IN THE U. K. 
I THINK 
THAT IS RIGHT L. MADE IT CLEAR TO 
THE OVERNIGHT TEAM AFTER THE 
EARTHQUAKE AND THERE HAS BEEN A 
CHANGE OF PENALTY AS WELL THAT 
THIS IS A LICENCE FEE FUNDED 
SERVICE IN GENERAL TERMS AND THIS 
SHOULD BE REFLECTED WE DO REFLECT 
GLOBAL ARTICLES BUT WHEN THERE IS 
A BRITISH STORY WE SHOULD REFLECT 
THAT 
AND VIEWERS THIS WEEK IF THAT THEY WERE UP LATE WOULD HAVE SEEN 
TWO STORIES ON THIS CHANNEL A 
STORY ABOUT STRIKING LORRY GRIVERS 
IN GREECE AND PERHAPS GREECE 
LORRY DRIVERS IN GREECE AND 
PERHAPS EVEN STRANGER A PIECE 
ABOUT MOTHER'S DAY IN MEXICO I'M I'M AFRAID I DIDN'T SEE THAT STORY BUT 
FOR THE OVERNIGHT SERVICE THE REMIT 
IS TO HAVE A WIDER AGENDA AND THE 
AUDIENCE SEEMS TO APPRECIATE THAT 
AS OPPOSED TO THE SORT OF THINGS WE 
COVER DURING THE DAY TIME BUT IF 
THERE ARE U. K. BREAKING STORIES WE 
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO COVER THOSE AS 
WE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO DO DURING 
DAY TIME 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
LAST WEEK SENIOR EXECUTIVES WERE 
GIVEN A HARD TIME IN GLASGOW BY 
VIEWERS GIVEN WHAT THEY SEE AS AN 
ANGLO CENTRED AGENDA OUR POST BAG 
SUGGESTS THIS IS A BIG ISSUE WITH 
VIEWERS WITH INSTANCES LIKE THIS 
PUPILS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY ARE 
BEING FORCED TO TAKE THE DAY OFF 
BECAUSE OF NATIONAL STRIKE UP AND 
DOWN THE COUNTRY 
NATIONAL STRIKE 
UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY ONLY 
ENGLAND AND WALES WERE AFFECTED 
WE HAVE BEEN PROMISED THAT WHEN A 
REPORT COMES OUT IN THE SUMMER MR. 
BYFORD WILL BE HERE TO ANSWER YOUR 
QUESTIONS I. T. V. HAS BEEN FINED MORE 
THAN ONE MILLION FOR ABUSES OF PHONE 
LINES AND THE B. B. C. HAS BEEN ACCUSED 
OF HOLDING ON TO FUNDS WHICH SHOULD 
HAVE GONE TO CHARITY THE HEADLINES 
HAVE BEEN DAMAGING FOR ALL 
PROGRAMME MAKERS AND B. B. C. STAFF HAVE 
BEEN MADE TO GO ON A TRAINING 
COURSE 
UNFORTUNATELY THERE WERE COURSE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS IN GETTING A 
VIEWER TO THE STUDIO SO A MEMBER OF 
THE AUDIENCE WAS ASKED TO STAND IN 
AND THIS WAS A MISTAKE 
THE B. B. C. HAS 
BEEN FORCED TO UNVEIL VARIOUS 
DECEPTIONS USUALLY RIGGING PHONE 
CALLS ONE OR TWO HEADS ROLLED AND 
THERE HAS BEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED 
CALL FOR RE TRAINING 
WHEN I SIT IN 
MY SITTING ROOM I EXPECT THE PEOPLE 
MAKING THE PROGRAMMES TO BE HONEST 
WITH ME L. DON'T MIND EDITING SHORT 
CUTS BUT I OBJECT TO BEING TOLD 
THAT SOMETHING IS TRUE WHEN IT 
ISN'T AND THIS PROGRAMME IS ABOUT 
DRAWING THE LINES 
THE FOCUS FOR 
JOURNALISTS AND PRODUCERS HAS BEEN 
LESS ON OUTRIGHT DECEPTION AND MORE 
ON GREY AREAS AT THIS POINT WE HAD 
HOPED TO SHOW YOU A CLIP OF TOP 
GEAR ONE OF THE PROGRAMMES WHICH 
CROP ED UP DURING DISCUSSIONS THE 
ISSUE WAS WHETHER DURING A RACE TO 
THE NORTH POLE THE B. B. C.'S JEREMY 
CLARKS ON WAS REALLY AT THE WHEEL 
ALL THE TIME 
CLARKSON AND THIS PROGRAMME 
ABOUT CLIMBING THE ANDES IT WAS 
NOT POSSIBLE TO GET A HELICOPTER 
VIEW OF THE TOP SO THESE VIEWS ARE 
ABOUT A WHOLE DIFFERENT GROUP LCT 
SO IT IS ABOUT USING ACCEPTABLE 
PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES OR DOES IT 
MATTER AT ALL 
THE B. B. C. HOPES THAT EVERYONE NOW 
KNOWS WHERE THE LINE IN THE SAND IS 
DRAWN YOU RUN THE B. B. C.'S COURSE ON 
JOURNALISM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE 
SAID WE'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG 
SO WAS IT JUST A PAPER EXERCISE IT IT TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT 
EXERCISE IT IS TRUE THAT THE 
PROBLEMS STARTED LAST SUMMER WERE 
ALSO ALL AROUND COMPETITIONS BUT 
IT CREATED A SLIGHT LACK OF 
CONFIDENCE IN THE INDUSTRY ABOUT 
SOME OF THE PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES 
WE USED A LOT OF CONCERNS CAME 
FROM THE STAFF THEMSELVES WHO 
RAISED QUESTIONS OVER WHAT THEY 
SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T DO SO WE 
ASKED JOURNALISTS WHAT MOST 
CONCERNED THEM AND THAT IS WHAT WE 
BUILT THE WORKSHOP AROUND WHAT WHAT WERE THE ISSUES THAT THE 
JOURNALISTS WERE RAISING THEY THEY RANGED SOME WERE ABOUT LIVE 
COVERAGE AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE 
IMPLY OR PRETEND SOMEBODY IS LIABLE 
AND THEY ARE NOT THERE WERE ISSUES 
ABOUT CHRONOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE AND 
HOW YOU ARE ABLE TO CHANGE THE 
CHRONOLOGY IF IT CHANGES THE 
MEANING OF THE PIECE AND THERE 
WERE ALSO USES IN RADIO ABOUT THE 
USES OF SOUND WHICH MIGHT MAKE YOU 
THINK YOU ARE SOMEWHERE WHEN YOU 
ARE NOT 
AND HOW MUCH DOES THE 
AUDIENCE CARE ABOUT THIS 
WITH DID 
A LOT OF AUDIENCE SURVEYS AND A 
RANGE OF ISSUES CAME OUT FIRST OF 
ALL THE AUDIENCES TRUST THE B. B. C. BY 
FIVE LONG MILE AHEAD BUT THE 
EXPECTATIONS OF THE B. B. C. ARE MUCH 
MUCH HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER 
BROADCASTER AND AS FOR THE 
TECHNIQUES THEIR APPROACH IS 
PROBABLY A LOT MORE LIBERAL THAN WE 
TAKE OURSELVES BUT ONE THING THAT 
BECAME VERY CLEAR WAS ALTHOUGH THEY 
DON'T WANT BROADCASTERS TO DECEIVE 
THEM IN ANY WAY AT ALL BUT NOR DO 
THEY WANT THE PROGRAMME SPOILT BY 
ENDLESS DISCLAIMERS LIKE THIS WAS 
RECORDED AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO 
SO THE QUESTION I HAD WAS WHEN 
THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF ARTEFICE HOW 
DO YOU LABEL IT 
AND HOW DO YOU 
MAINTAIN TRUST GOING FORWARD TRUST TRUST ONE A PRIORITY AND LET'S BE OPEN 
ABOUT THAT B. B. C. JOURNALISTS HAVE 
TAKEN TRUST EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY AND 
ALWAYS WILL IN TERMS OF THE 
WORKSHOPS THEY WILL CARRY ON AND 
EVERY NEW JOURNALIST JOINING THE 
B. B. C. WILL BE ASKED TO TAKE PART IN 
THEM 
AND WAS THIS A GOOD EXERCISE THEM YES IT WAS REALLY GOOD DEBATE 
RIGHT ACROSS THE INDUSTRY THE 
FEEDBACK WE'VE HAD FROM EVERYBODY 
WHO HAS DONE THE WORKSHOP WAS 
EXTREMELY GOOD AND WE DID A SURVEY 
AFTERWARDS AND TWO THIRDS OF THE 
STAFF IN THE B. B. C. WANT MORE OF THIS 
KIND OF TRAINING AND A MAJORITY OF 
THOSE WANT THAT TRAINING TO BE MADE 
MANDATORY MANDATORY THANKS FOR ALL YOUR COMMENTS THIS 
WEEK TO TELL US WHAT YOU THINK 
ABOUT B. B. C. NEWS OR CURRENT AFFAIRS 
YOU CAN CALL US OR E. MAIL US 
THANKS FOR WATCHING WHO KNOWS WHAT 
WILL BE MAKING OUR NEWS NEXT WEEK

GORDON BROWN ATTACKS BURMA'S 
INHUMANE RESPONSE TO CYCLONE NARGIS 
THE RED CROSS SAYS THE COUNTRY 
FACES A CATASTROPHE OF STAGGERING 
PROPORTIONS PROPORTIONS AS THE SUPERMARKETS GET TOUGH ON 
PLASTIC BAGS THEY ARE ACCUSED OF 
DIVERTING ATTENTION AWAY FROM THEIR 
OWN WASTEFUL WAYS 
SUN SEA AND SURCHARGES WHY 
HOLIDAY MAKERS ARE BEING ASK TO DO 
PAY EXTRA FOR THEIR SUMMER BREAK 
I'M AT WEMBLEY FOR THE F. A. CUP FINAL 
THAT NO ONE PREDICTED AS 
PORTSMOUTH TAKE ON CARDIFF 
THERE MIGHT BE ONE OF TWO NERVES IN 
WINDSOR AS THE QUEEN'S GRANDSON 
PETER PHILLIPS PREPARES FOR A ROYAL 
WEDDING WEDDING BUT FIRST OUR MAIN STORY FOREIGN 
RESCUE WORKERS ARE BEING ALLOWED 
INTO CHINA FOR THE FIRST TIME TO 
HELP IN THE DESPERATE SEARCH FOR 
SURVIVORS OF MONDAY'S EARTHQUAKE 
OFFICIALS SAY THE NUMBER OF DEAD 
COULD REACH FIFTY THOUSAND AND UP TO FIVE 
MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEFT 
HOMELESS THERE'S GROWING ANGER 
INSIDE CHINA ABOUT WHY SO MANY 
SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS FAILED 
TO WITHSTAND THE EARTHQUAKE AS THE 
HOURS WEAR ON THE CHANCES OF 
FINDING SOMEONE ANYONE ALIVE 
ARE RARE BUT STILL THEY EMERGE 
THIS ELDERLY WOMAN IN BEICHUAN 
PULLED FROM THE RUBBLE SHE THANK 
AS HIGHER POWER FOR SALVATION IN 
SAFE HANDS THESE THREE LITTLE GIRLS 
RESCUED AFTER EIGHTY SEVEN HOURS IN THE DARK 
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH SPACE TO GET 
OUT SHE SAYS AS HER EYES ARE 
SHIELDED FROM THE BRIGHT DAYLIGHT 
HER FATHER SAYS I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT 
HER CONDITION WAS BUT KNOWING SHE 
WAS THERE COMFORTED ME SHE SAID 
DADDY I'M FINE BUT FEW WILL BE 
FOUND THERE YET STILL THEY WILL 
SEARCH THERE'S HELP FROM OVERSEAS 
THESE SPECIALLY TRAINED TEAMS FROM 
FROM TAIWAN THIS IS WHAT THEY FACE 
FIVE MILLION HAVE BEEN MADE HOMELESS 
A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION HERE 
SCHOOLS WERE PARTICULARLY BADLY HIT 
SEVEN THOUSAND FELL ACROSS THE PROVE INS 
PCTS WANT TO KNOW PROVINCE 
PARENTS WANT TO KNOW WHY THEY 
BLAME CORRUPT OFFICIALS AND SHODDY 
WORKMANSHIP THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
PROMISED AN INVESTIGATION BUT 
THERE IS A MORE IMMEDIATE TASK AT 
HAND BURYING THE DEAD AND 
PROTECTING AGAINST DISEASE THE 
FOCUS NOW IS FIRMLY ON THOSE 
STRUGGLING WITH THE AFTERMAFRT 
THESE THREE SHEETS OF P. L. A. 
AFTERMATH THESE PLEA SHEETS OF 
PLASTIC ARE HOME FORM THIS FAMILY 
THIS WOMAN WAS VISITING HER SON WE 
WERE THE QUAKE STRUCK I'M FROM 
ANOTHER PROVINCE AND COMING HERE I 
FEEL I HAVE NO ONE TO RELY ON SHE 
SAYS I HOPE THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT TO AND HELP US 
TAKING CARE OF HER AND THE 
REMAINING SURVIVORS IS NOW WHAT 
MATTERS MATTERS GORDON BROWN HAS ACCUSED THE 
BURMESE REGIME OF INHUMAN TREATMENT 
BY PREVENTING AID FROM GETTING 
THROUGH TO THE SURVIVORS OF CYCLONE 
NARGIS HE TOLD THE B. B. C. THE BURMESE 
GENERALS SHOULD BE HELD TO ACCOUNT 
FOR THE INTOLERABLE SITUATION 
OFFICIAL ESTIMATES PUT THE NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE DEAD OR MISSING AT 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND THE B. B. C. IS PREVENTED FROM 
REPORTING INSIDE BURMA OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IS IN NEIGHBOURING 
THAILAND GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
CHRIS THIS OFFICIAL ESTIMATE OF 
AROUND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DOES THAT 
ACCURATELY REFLECT DO YOU THINK 
THE NUMBERS OF MISSING AND DEAD 
NOW 
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IT IS NOW A LOT CLOSER TO SOME OF THE 
ESTIMATES WE HAVE SEEN FROM 
ORGANISATIONS LIKE THE RED CROSS 
BUT THE FACT THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT 
BASICALLY DOUBLED THEIR ESTIMATE OF 
THE NUMBER OF DEAD AND MISING IN A 
TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD TELLS YOU I THINK 
HOW DIFFICULT TO THE GET AN 
ACCURATE PICTURE ON THE GROUND IF 
THEY THEMSELVES CAN'T GET AN 
ACCURATE PICTURE THAT THEY NEED TO 
BOOST THEIR ESTIMATES JUST SO 
HUGELY OVER SUCH A SHORT PERIOD 
YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT 
THE SITUATION IS AND THE 
PARTICULAR PROBLEM WITH THAT IS 
UNLESS YOU CAN GET AN ACCURATE 
PICTURE IT IS DIFFER TO PLAN WELL 
TO FIND HOW TO HELP THE SURVIVORS 
OF THIS STORM 
GORDON BROWN 
ACCUSING THE BURMESE REGIME OF 
INHUMANE TREATMENT HOW MANY EVER 
HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT WOULD A 
COMMEND LIKE THAT FROM THE BRITISH 
PRIME MINISTER HAVE ON THE BURMESE 
JUNTA COMMENT 
HISTORY TELLS US 
THAT IN THE PAST THE GOVERNMENT IN 
BURMA HAS PRETTY MUCHRY JECTED ANY 
CRITICISM OF THEM RICH REJECTED 
ANY CRITICISM OF THEM FOR ANYTHING 
THEY HAVE DONE FOR THE LAST TWO 
WEEKS THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL HAS 
BEEN TRYING TO TELEPHONE THE 
BURMESE LEADER AND THE GENERAL 
HASN'T EVEN PICKED UP THE PHONE 
THEY WILL PROBABLY SHRUG THIS OFF 
BUT GORDON BROWN'S POINT IS THERE 
NEEDS TO BE CONCERTED PRESSURE HIS 
COMMENTS ARE PART OF A PATTERN WE 
ARE SEEING COMMENTS FROM STRONG 
UNDIPLOMATIC LANGUAGE FROM THE 
FRENCH AMBASSADOR IN THE UN ON 
FRIDAY NIGHT WE ARE SEEING 
DIPLOMATIC MOVES THE UN'S TOP 
HUMANITARIAN OFFICIAL PLYING INTO 
BURMA TOMORROW NIGHT WHAT GORDON 
BROWN IS SAYING IS THAT CONCERTED 
PRESSURE NEEDS BE KEPT UP IT WAS 
BEST WAY TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF 
BURMA WILL BE TO PERSUADE THE 
GENERALS WHO RUN THAT COUNTRY TO 
RELENT THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT HE 
SAYS IS BY PUTTING PRESSURE ON 
THEM 
CHRIS THANK YOU THEM THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY ON PLASTIC 
BAGS IS ALLOWING SUPERMARKETS TO 
PASS THE BUCK FOR CUTTING WASTE ON 
TO SHOPPERS THAT'S ACCORDING TO 
ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN 
ADVISERS PROFESSOR CHRIS COGGINS 
SAYS THE FOCUS ON CARRIER BAGS IS 
DIVERTING ATTENTION FROM FAR MORE 
PRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS AND 
IS CONFUSING CUSTOMERS BREAKFAST'S 
KEITH DOYLE HAS THIS REPORT IF YOU 
ARE DOING A SUPERMARKET SHOP THIS 
WEEKEND YOU MAY NOTICE A DIFFERENCE 
AT THE TILLS SINGLE USE PLASTIC 
BAGS ARE IN SHORTER FLY WITH MARKS 
AND AMP SPENCER CHARGING AND OTHER 
RETAILERS USING VARIOUS INCENTIVES 
TO GETS US TO REDUCE THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
BILLION WE USE EVERY YEAR BUT WHY 
SO MUCH ATTENTION ON THE PLASTIC 
BAG ONE GOVERNMENT ADVISER SAYS 
THEY ARE OVERREACTING AND 
SUPERMARKETS ARE PASSING THE BUCK 
TO COMMERCE 
THEY HAVE PURCHASING 
POWER POWER IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY 
BUY AND HOW IT IS PACKED THE 
PROBLEM IS IN A SENSE BY FOCUSING 
ON THE CONSUMER END THEY ARE TO 
SOME EXTENT DIVERTING ATTENTION 
FROM WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING THE 
PUBLIC SEE PLASTIC BAGS AS AN ISSUE 
BUT IN REALITY THEY ARE A SPRE 
SMALL PROPORTION OF THE WASTE A 
VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF THE OIL 
THAT THEY USE THEREFORE IN OVERALL 
RESOURCE TERMS IT IS A VISUAL THING 
RATHER THAN A MAIN STREAM ISSUE 
THE GOVERNMENT'S PUT PRESSURE ON 
RETAILERS AND SUPERMARKETS GIVING 
THEM AN ULTIMATUM TO REDUCE PLASTIC 
BAG USE BY QUARTER OR FACE TAXES 
IT IS MAKING PROVISION FOR BAG 
TAX IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE BILL 
GOING THROUGH PARLIAMENT NOW 
RETAILERS SAY FOCUSING ON BAGS IS 
WASTING THEIR TIME 
THERE ARE A LOT 
OF VERY IMPORTANT PROVISIONS WITHIN 
THE CLIMATE CHANGE BILL WE DO 
SUPPORT WE THINK THIS IS A RATHER 
TRIVIAL ISSUE TO ADD ON TO IT IT 
IS NOT JUST A SLEDGEHAMMER IT IS 
USING A STREAM STEAMROLL TORE CRACK 
A WALNUT 
THIS WASTE IS DESTINED FOR LANDFILL 
BUT LESS THAN TWO PER CENT OF WHAT GOES INTO 
LANDFILL IS MADE UP OF PACKAGING 
AND ONLY AL TINY FRACTION OF THAT IS 
PLASTIC BAGS THE GOVERNMENT ADMITS 
TAXING PLASTIC BAGS IS UNLIKELY TO 
HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON VOLS OF 
WASTE BUT SAYS THAT ISN'T THE POINT 
WE KNOW THE PUBLIC IS ON OUR SIDE 
THEY WANT ACTION AND IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO TAKE THAT AFPBLGTS IT 
MAY BE A SMALL PART OF THE WASTE 
STREAM BUT IT IS SYMBOLIC OF OUR 
THROWAWAY SOCIETY WE DO NEED TO DO 
SOMETHING TO CURB THEIR USE THE THE GOVERNMENT MAY HOPE THAT PLASTIC 
BAG GUILT WILL MAKE US ALL BECOME 
MORE ECOFRIENDLY BUT WHATEVER THE 
MOTIVES OR THE CRITICISM REDUCING 
THEIR USE AND THE EYESORE THEY 
CAUSE CAN BE NO BAD THING 
IN A FEW MINUTES WE'LL BE SPEAKING 
TO MORRISONS WHO FROM NEXT WEEK MR. 
BE GIVING AWAY RE USABLE PLASTIC 
BAGS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS

TEAM OUT IN THE CUP FINAL IS 
FANTASTIC FOR POMPEY FANS TO BE 
GOING THERE TO GO TO THE SEMIS AND 
NOW THE FINAL IT'S GOING BE A 
GREAT DAY 
FANS CAN EXPECT A HEAVY 
POLICE PRESENCE AROUND WEMBLEY 
PARTICULARLY AFTER THE PROBLEMS AT 
THE UEFA CUP FINAL IN MANCHESTER 
BUT FOR THE PLAYERS THIS IS A 
CHANCE TO GRAB A PIECE OF SPORTING 
HISTORY JUST ONE NAME IN 
PARTICULAR TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THE 
CARDIFF SQUAD AARON RAMSEY JUST 
SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD THIS TIME LAST YEAR 
HE WAS TAKING HIS GCSES TODAY HE 
COULD BECOME THE YOUNGEST WINNER IN 
THE HISTORY OF THE F. A. CUP 
ANDY Y. THANK YOU 
THE MATCH KICKS OFF AT THREE HUNDRED P. M. LIVE 
ON B. B. C. ONE 
THE QUEEN'S ELDEST GRANDCHILD WILL 
GET MARRIED TODAY AT SAINT GEORGE'S 
CHAPEL IN WINDSOR PETER PHILLIPS 
THE SON OF PRINCESS ANNE WILL WED 
CANADIAN MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT 
AUTUMN KELLY THE BRIDE HAS GIVEN 
UP HER CATHOLIC FAITH TO ALLOW HER 
FIANCE TO RETAIN HIS PLACE AS ELEVENTH 
IN LINE TO THE THRONE THOSE ARE 
OUR TOP STORIES 
TAKING YOUR OWN CARRIER BAGS TO THE 
SUPERMARKET IS JUST ONE OF THE WAYS 
IN WHICH SHOPPERS HOPE TO HELP THE 
ENVIRONMENT BUT NOW A GOVERNMENT 
ADVISER SAYS THE ISSUE OF PLASTIC 
BAGS IS THREATENING TO SIDELINE 
MORE PRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL 
CONCERNS ANGUS MACIVER IS FROM THE 
SUPERMARKET CHAIN MORRISONS WHICH 
NEXT WEEK WILL GIVE REUSEABLE BAGS 
TO CUSTOMERS HE JOINS US FROM OUR 
LEEDS STUDIO 
THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US WHAT'S 
MORRISONS POSITION ON THIS DO YOU 
THINK YOU ARE DIVERTING ATTENTION 
FROM MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES 
NOT AT 
ALL WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT THIS 
ISN'T THE MOST IMPORTANT 
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE THE ONLY 
REASON WE WOULD BE RESPONDING ON 
PLASTIC BAGS IS THAT OUR CUSTOMERS 
TELL US THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT 
THAT'S WHY WE ARE GIVING AWAY TEN 
MILLION RE USABLE BAGS NEXT WEEK 
ONE FOR EVERY ONE OF OUR CUSTOMERS 
BUT THERE ARE BIGGER ISSUES AND WE 
ARE WORKING ON THE BIGGER ISSUES 
WE'VE HAD LOT OF COMMENT FROM 
PEOPLE THEY WERE IRRITATED THAT 
THEY AS CUSTOMERS ARE ASKED BY YOU 
AND OTHER STOUMENTS GET USED TO NOT 
USING SO MANY PLASTIC BAGS AND YOU 
STILL CONTINUE PACKAGING SO MUCH 
STUFF IN SO MUCH PLASTIC AND 
EFFECTIVELY AS SHOPPER IN THIS 
THEIR NORMAL SHOP THEY ARE HAVING 
TROUBLE AVOIDING IT WHY DON'T YOU 
DEAL WITH THAT 
WE HAVE REDUCED OUR 
PACKAGING BY EIGHT THOUSAND TONNES IN THE 
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT'S THE 
EQUIVALENT OF SEVENTEEN MILLION SANDWICH 
BOXES EACH DAY WE HAVE MADE A HUGE 
EFFORT BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER 
ABOUT PACKAGING THAT IT PROTECTS 
FOOD AND MAKES IT LAST LONGER AS 
YOU KNOW LAST WEEK WRAP PRODUCED A 
REPORT WHICH SAID WE ARE THROWING 
AWAY THIRTY PER CENT OF OUR FOOD IF WE DIDN'T 
PACKAGE OUR FOOD WE WOULD BE 
THROWING AWAY EVEN MORE WE ARE 
REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT BY 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND TONNES THAT'S THE 
EQUIVALENT OF FLYING TO AND FRO 
FROM NEW YORK NINETY TIME AS DAY EVERY 
DAY WE HAVE REALLY MADE BIG 
SURPRISE TO HELP REDUCE WASTE AND 
IN CARBON 
SOME OF THE STATISTICS SOUND 
IMPRESSIVE THE STARTING POINT YOU 
COME FROM IS PRETTY POOR THOUGH 
ISN'T IT YOU TALK ABOUT THE 
REDUCTION IN PACKAGING BUT THAT 
CAME FROM DREADFUL START IN POINT 
ON THE SUPERMARKET SHELVES THERE 
IS STILL AN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF PRE 
PACKAGED IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE 
USELESS PLASTIC 
I DON'T AGREE THAT 
IT IS NECESSARY UNNECESSARY IT 
WOULDN'T PACKAGE THINGS UP FOOD 
WOULD NOT LAST AS LONG THAT IS THE 
MAJOR THING WE USED PACKAGING FOR 
IT PROTECTS FOOD AND MAKES IT LAST 
LONGER 
LIKE WHAT WHAT IS LONGER SOMETHING YOU THINK IS ABSOLUTELY 
ESSENTIAL TO HAVE LOTS OF PLASTIC 
AROUND IT CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL 
CAN IT NOT BE 
WRAPPED IN PAPER 
PAPER WOULD NOT 
LAST AS LONG IT IS NOT AS GOOD A 
NAME BARRIER AND IT IS WORSE FOR 
THE ENVIRONMENT IT TAKES UP MORE 
SPACE IN LORRIES WHAT WE'RE DOING 
WITH PACKAGING IS THE BEST WAY THAT 
WE CAN SEEK TO PROTECT THE FOOD AND 
AT THE MOMENT AND WORK WITH THE 
ENVIRONMENT OF COURSE WE ARE 
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT PACKAGING 
TYPES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THINGS 
LIKE BIODEGRADABLE PACKAGING 
BIODEGRADABLE PACKAGING AND SITU 
GREENHOUSE GASES ANTS TO IT IS 
MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN YOU ARE 
REPRESENTING REPRESENTING IN THE HEADLINES FOR THE FIRST 
TIME CHINA IS ALLOWING FOREIGN 
RESCUE WORKERS INTO THE COUNTRY TO 
HELP IN THE SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS OF 
MONDAY'S EARTHQUAKE 
CUTTING DOWN ON PLASTIC BAGS NOW 
SUPERMARKETS ARE ACCUSED OF 
DIVERTING ATTENTION AWAY FROM MORE 
SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
STILL TO COME HOLIDAY PRICE HIKES 
WHY SOME TRAVEL COMPANIES ARE 
DEMANDING MORE CASH FOR HOLIDAYS 
CUSTOMERS THOUGHT THEY HAD ALREADY 
PAID FOR AND IT IS LEGAL LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE WEATHER 
I THINK ONLY THE HARDIEST WILL BE 
HEADING FOR THE BEACH TODAY MUCH 
CLOUDIER THAN RECENT DAYS THERE 
WILL BE A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN AROUND 
AS WELL FOR SOME HEAVY DOWNPOURS 
FOR OTHERS NOTHING MORE THAN A FEW 
SPOTS IT IS CLOUDY PICTURE 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE U. K. BRAKES ARE 
FEW AND FAR BETWEEN A FEW ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND CHIEFLY ACROSS 
THE FAR NORTH OF SCOTLAND THERE 
ARE SHOWERS ACROSS CENTRAL SOUTHERN 
SCOTLAND FEW FOR NORTHERN ENGLAND 
ESPECIALLY LIVERPOOL NORTH WALES 
WE WILL SEE MORE AND AWARE OF RAIN 
DEVELOPING TOWARDS THE SOUTH EAST 
IN THE SOUTH WEST SOME VERY LIVELY 
DOWNPOURS THERE WILL CONTINUE INTO 
THE AFTERNOON SLOW MOVING 
THUNDERSTORMS PERHAPS TORRENTIAL 
AND PLACES EVEN ONCE IT BRIGHTENS 
UP IT IS NOT GOING TO BE 
PARTICULARLY WARM ACROSS WALES 
GENERALLY CLOUDY THE ODD GLIMPSE 
OF BRIGHTNESS IN THE AFTERNOON 
AFTER DRY AND SUNNY WEEK IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND WE WILL SEE MORE 
CLOUD THE SHOWERS ARE FAIRLY 
ISOLATED DRYING UP ACROSS MUCH OF 
SCOTLAND NOT ESPECIALLY WARM IN 
THE NORTH EASTERN BREEZE JUST NINE OR 
TEN DEGREES ACROSS NORTHERN AND 
EASTERN AREAS DESPITE THE SUNSHINE 
FEELING CHILLY EVEN WITH SOME 
SUNSHINE TO THE EAST OF NORTHERN 
ENGLAND WESTERN AREAS REMAIN 
CLOUDY THE FURTHER SOUTH BECOME 
THE HEAVIER THE SHOWERS COULD BE 
INTO THE AFTERNOON NOT LOOKING 
EXACTLY BREAK FOR THE FINAL AT 
WEMBLEY THAT IS COVERED ON B. B. C. ONE 
AND FIVE LIVE LATER ON L. SUSPECT LIKE 
YESTERDAY THERE WILL BE 
INTERRUPTIONS ON AND OFF AT LORD'S 
FOR THE CRICKET SOME OF THAT RAIN 
COULD BE HEAVY FOR TIME THIS 
EVENING IT WILL GRADUALLY BECOME 
CONFINED TO THE SOUTHERNMOST 
COUNTIES OF ENGLAND MOST OF US 
OVERNIGHT BECOME DRY AND SKIES 
BECOME INCREASINGLY CLEAR IT 
MEAN THAT TEMPERATURES WILL DROP 
AWAY DOWN TO BALI IS LOW ENOUGH 
FOR A TOUCH OF GRASS FROST ACROSS 
NORTHERN ENGLAND IN SCOTLAND THERE 
COULD BE AN AIR FROST BY THE TIME 
WE GET TO TOMORROW MORNING 
COMPARED TO TODAY TOMORROW IS 
BRIGHTER THE CLOUD WILL EASE AWAY 
AND SUNSHINE WILL DEVELOP THE 
CLOUD WILL BUBBLE UP SPREAD OUT OF 
IT THAT WILL WEAKEN THE SUNSHINE 
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN TOMORROW 
DRY AND BRIGHT TODAY TEMPERATURES 
TWELVE TO SIXTEEN DEGREES PUTTING THAT INTO 
PERSPECTIVE A GOOD TEN CELSIUS 
LOWER THAN WE SAW LAST WEEKEND 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN TWENTY 
YEARS THOUSANDS OF HOLIDAYMAKERS 
ARE BEING ASKED TO STUMP UP MORE 
MONEY FOR HOLIDAYS THEY HAVE 
ALREADY PAID FOR THE TRAVEL 
COMPANIES SAY IT IS BECAUSE OF THE 
STRONG EURO AND THE PRICE OF 
AIRLINE FUEL THE CONSUMERS' 
ASSOCIATION SAYS THERE NEEDS TO BE 
FAR MORE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW 
MUCH MORE CUSTOMERS NEED TO PAY 
SUMMER HOLIDAYS THEY'RE ALL ABOUT 
SUN SAND AND SEA BUT THIS YEAR 
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE SIR 
CHARGES SOME HOLIDAY COMPANIES ARE 
FORCING CUSTOMERS TO PAY MORE FOR 
THEIR SUMMER BREAK THEY BLAME IT 
ON THE STRENGTH OF THE EURO SO FAR 
TWENTY THREE HOLIDAY FIRMS ARE ASKING FOR 
EXTRA ABTA SAYS SEVERAL THOUSAND 
HOLIDAYMAKERS ARE BEING AFFECTED 
AT TIME WHEN MANY FAMILIES ARE 
FACING RISING COSTS ELSEWHERE IT 
IS A MOVE THAT IS NOT GOING DOWN 
WELL 
THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY IS THE WELL ONLY ONE IN WHICH YOU CAN PAY FOR A 
PRODUCT YOU PAY FOR IT MONTHS IN 
ADVANCE AND A MONTH BEFORE YOU 
WERE DUE TO GET THAT PRODUCT OR 
SERVICE YOU ASKED TO PAY EVEN MORE 
WE THINK THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY REALLY 
SHOULD PUT THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER AND 
STOP PASSING SURCHARGES ON TO 
CONSUMERS 
WHAT CAN COMPANIES MAKE CONSUMERS THEIR CUSTOMERS PAY UNDER THE 
RULES THEY CAN CHARGE UP TO TEN PER CENT 
EXTRA THEY HAVE TO OBSERVE 
ABSORB THE FIRST TWO PER CENT THEY CAN ASK 
WHAT THE COST OF AIRLINE FUEL 
AIRPORT TAXES AND CURRENCY 
FLUCTUATIONS BUT THEY CANNOT ASK 
FOR THE MONEY IF IT IS LESS THAN THIRTY 
DAYS BEFORE DEPARTURE THE BIGGEST 
TOUR OPERATORS INCLUDING THOMAS 
COOK HAVE SAID THEY WILL NOT 
CHARGE EXTRA BUT MANY OTHERS HAVE 
NOT GIVEN BE GUARANTEED PROVIDING PROVIDING THAT THEY HAVE CLEARED WITH ABTA 
THAT THEY CAN PASS IT ON YOU DON'T 
HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE EITHER YOU 
PAY THE FULL AMOUNT OR YOU HAVE NOT 
PAID FOR YOUR HOLIDAY HOLIDAYS ARE 
ALWAYS EXPENSIVE 
EVEN IF YOU ARE 
ONLY ASKED TO PAY A SURCHARGE OF A 
FEW PER CENT EXTRA IT CAN MAKE A REAL DENT 
IN YOUR HOLIDAY MONEY THAT COULD 
MEAN YOU HAVE TO CUT BACK ON YOUR 
SPENDING PLANS WHEN YOU GET THERE 
THANK YOU BUT SOME SMALL TOUR 
OPERATORS BELIEVE THERE IS NO 
REASON TO MAKE CUSTOMERS PAY A 
SURCHARGE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS THE POUND 
HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY STRONG 
WE HAVE 
DONE INCREDIBLY WELL NOW THE POUND 
HAS MOVED THE OTHER WAY I AM NOT 
CONVINCED IT IS THE RIGHT DECISION 
TO BE HEADING TO OUR CLIENTS TO 
BAIL US OUT THE TRY LINE INDUSTRY 
SAYS THE COMPANIES MUST HAVE THE 
OPTION OF SURCHARGES AND REJECTS 
THE SUGGESTION THEY ARE NOT BEING 
OPEN 
IT IS QUITE TRANSPARENT IT OPEN IT MIGHT BE IN THE SMALL PRINT AT THE 
BACK BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES 
TUCKED AWAY IN THERE AS WELL SO 
YES THERE ARE RULES AND THERE ARE 
GUIDELINES THEY HAVE BEEN PUT IN 
PLACE TO PROTECT THE CUSTOMER SO 
FAR MOST TRAVEL FIRE FIRMS ARE 
NOT ADDING SURCHARGE 
THEY ARE 
STILL DO SO IN TIME FOR SUMMER 
ESPECIALLY IF THE PAN STARTS TO 
FALL AGAIN AGAINST THE EURO WE 
WERE TALKING A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT 
WE WILL BE GETTING A OPINION ON 
THAT FOR MYTRAVEL JOURNALIST 
BY ITS HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS 
HELLO AGAIN 
FIRST THAT HAVE A BETTER HEADLINES 
THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES THE 
THERE WE HAVE RUN AT THIS MORNING 
ASKING FOR THE BRITISH HOSTAGES TO 
BE RELEASED THE PICTURE IS 
HARRISON FORD IN CANNES HEAD OF 
HIS MOVIE INDIANA JONES ALL OF THE 
TALK AS IF HE CAN CARRY IT OFF AT 
SIXTY FIVE THE DAILY MAIL THAT MORNING 
SAYS THAT N. H. S. DOCTORS ARE REFUSING 
TO CARRY OUT LATE ABORTIONS 
IT MEANS THAT THREE QUARTERS OF THE 
SEVEN THOUSAND TERMINATIONS PERFORMED AFTER 
SEVENTEEN WEEKS' PREGNANCY ARE BEING 
CARRIED OUT OUTSIDE THE NATIONAL 
HEALTH SERVICE YOU PROBABLY SAW 
THESE IN EDGES YESTERDAY 
THIS IS MAKE REGAN THE POLICE 
OFFICER WHO FELL TO THE GROUND AND 
WAS ATTACKED AFTER THAT UEFA CUP 
FINAL IN MANCHESTER HE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT HIS ORDEAL THE DAILY EXPRESS 
SAYS THERE IS NEW HOPE FOR AN END 
TO THE ECONOMIC SLUMP 
IT SAYS AFTER WEEKS OF GLOOM THE 
FINALLY FINELY THE MARKETS BEGAN 
TO RALLY THEY ASKED FOR REPORTS 
THIS MORNING OF PEOPLE BEING PULLED 
OUT OF THE RUBBLE IN CHINA 
SOME OF THE DEVASTATION THE 
INDEPENDENT FEATURING ONE OF THOSE 
PICTURES YOU CAN SEE HER FACTORY 
WORKER BEING BROUGHT OUT HAVING 
SPENT ONE HUNDRED HOURS UNDER THE RUBBLE 
LAUREN GOOD MORNING L. KNOW YOU 
ARE STILL MAKING NOTES L. THINK 
THIS CONFUSES A LOT OF PEOPLE A 
NUMBER OF BIG COMPANIES REPORTING 
BOOSTED PROFITS AND YET WE ALL 
SEEM TO BE PAYING MORE L. SUPPOSE 
THERE IS A CONNECTION HERE THIS THIS HEADLINE SUMS IT UP PRICES ARE 
RARE AND PROFITS ARE UP AROUND THE 
WORLD THE COSTS OF BASICS ARE 
RISING PEOPLE LIKE SAINSBURY'S AND 
ORGANISATIONS HAVE JUST ANNOUNCED A 
YEARLY PROFIT OF TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT RISE TO FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT 
MILLION AS WE KNOW WHEN YOU GO 
INTO THE SUPERMARKETS NOW THE 
PRICE OF BREAD IS OF A THIRD 
BASICS LIKE MILK OTHER STAPLES OF 
THE DIET ARE ALSO UP WHAT IS 
HAPPENING RATHER THAN CUTTING ANY 
OF THE PROFITS TO THEIR 
SHAREHOLDERS AND THEIR COMPANIES 
WE ARE PAYING MORE THE SAME THING 
GOES FOR THE COST OF HEATING YOUR 
HOME THE PRICE OF LIVING IS GOING 
UP FINALLY REGULATORS ARE LOOKING 
AT THE PRICE RISES OFCOM I HAVE 
TO WONDER WHAT THESE REGULATORS ARE 
FOR THEY SEEMED TO JUMP ON THE 
BALL ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER THE PAY 
RISES AFTER THE COST OF GAS HAS 
GONE UP THEY ARE LOOKING AT GAS 
AND ELECTRICITY TWENTY FOUR BILLION A YEAR 
INDUSTRY FIFTEEN PER CENT RISE THIS YEAR THAT 
IS A LOT OF MONEY FOR AVERAGE HOME 
THIS THOUGHT PROCESS DOES OCCUR TO 
A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT WHAT DO YOU 
DO ESPECIALLY AT THE SUPERMARKET 
PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY STUFF SOMEWHERE 
THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING IS 
TAKING A LOOK AT THIS VERY 
SERIOUSLY AND HAS RAIDED THE 
OFFICES OF TESCO ASDA MORRISONS 
AND SAINSBURY'S LAST MONTH THAT 
INVESTIGATION ABOUT PRICE FIXING 
STOP THE PRICE FIXING AND CUT YOUR 
PROFITS AT IT 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS 
GOING UP BY UP TO EIGHTY PER CENT MORE TALK TALK ABOUT UNPLEASANT PRICE FIXING THIS 
WEEK YOU CAN GET YOUR HOLIDAYS FOR 
EXAMPLE AT A FOUR STAR HOTEL IN 
THE ALGARVE FOR AROUND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX PER 
PERSON FOR SEVEN NIGHTS GO AFTER 
MAY SEVENTEENTH AND IT IS SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FOR AN 
IDENTICAL CALL IDENTICAL HOLIDAY 
YOU KNOW THE AGONY THE SCHOOLS SAY 
THEY CANNOT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN OUT 
IT IS ILLEGAL TRUANCY AT THE SAME 
TIM YOU REALLY CANNOT AFFORD TO 
TAKE THEIR CHILDREN AWAY WHAT THEY 
DO IN FRANCE IS EACH REGION HAS 
STAGGERED HOLIDAYS THE TROUBLE IS 
IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE DIFFERENT 
SCHOOLS AND THEY HAVE STAGGERED 
HOLIDAYS WHEN DO YOU TAKE THEM 
IF YOU DO THE SOUTH EAST GOES HERE 
THE NORTH EAST GOES THE SECOND WEEK 
IN JUNE THERE IS AN EASY WAY TO 
IT DO YOU THINK THESE 
DISCREPANCIES HAVE GOT WORSE L. AM 
TRYING TO THINK BACK L. WONDER IF 
TWENTY YEARS AGO PEOPLE FACED THE SAME 
PROBLEM AND IT IS JUST THAT WE GO 
AWAY MORE 
I THINK AND EIGHTY PER CENT CHANGE 
IN ONE WEEK SEEMS EXTREME BUT BUT PRESUMABLY THEY DO IT BECAUSE 
PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR IT THEY WILL 
SAY THE REST OF THE YEAR THEY 
SUBSIDISE IT 
LET'S MOVE TO A COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT TONE THE GUARDIAN 
HAVING A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING 
IN HEBRON 
THIS IS INTERESTING 
BECAUSE IT IS BY THE WRITER IAN 
JACK IT IS A GOOD SATURDAY PIECE 
HE HAS JUST COME BACK FROM THE 
FIRST PALESTINE FESTIVAL OF 
LITERATURE PADDY DOYLE WAS THERE 
AND HE HAS BEEN AMAZED BY THE 
SITUATION IN PALESTINE IN HEBRON 
HE SAYS THAT DURING THE FIRST VISIT 
THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND PALESTINIANS 
LIVING THERE BECAUSE OF THE 
PRESENCE OF FIVE HUNDRED SETTLERS THE PLACE 
IS NOW A GHOST TOWN THREE QUARTERS 
OF THE SHOPS HAVE CLOSED THE 
MARKET NO LONGER OPENS FOUR THOUSAND 
ISRAELI SOLDIERS PATROLLED THE 
STREETS I THINK WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT 
A. R. ARTICLE LIKE THIS IS THAT IT IS 
A FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCE OF A 
SITUATION THAT THE REST OF US YOU 
CAN'T QUITE TASTE IT UNTIL YOU GET 
THERE A WONDERFUL PIECE L. 
RECOMMEND IT

A STORE IT HE HAS BEEN CALLED THE 
BLADE RUNNER

NOW ALLOWED TO GO TO THE OLYMPICS

HALF LEG SPRINGS ON AND I THOUGHT 
THEY WERE SUPERIMPOSED BUT THIS 
GENTLEMAN HAS HAD THEM FOR A WHILE 
RUNNING SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND HE'S BEEN 
GIVEN PERMISSION TO RUN WITH ABLE 
BODIED ATHLETES L. THINK ONE OTHER 
ATHLETE SWIMMER HAS BEEN GIVEN 
PERMISSION THEY WERE NOT SURE 
WHETHER PROSTHETIC LIMBS GIVE AN 
ADVANTAGE 
IF HE DOESN'T GET THE ADVANTAGE RIGHT TIME HE WON'T BE ABLE TO GO

ENGLAND'S CONTRIBUTESER ALSO BE

INTERRUPTED BY BAD LIGHT AND RAIN 
ENGLAND WILL RESUME ON SIXTY EIGHT WITHOUT

FIRST INNINGS TOTAL OF TWO HUNG SEVENTY SEVEN 
FIRST INNINGS TOTAL OF TWO HUNG SEVENTY SEVEN HAVE BEEN THE ENGLAND BATSMEN 
COMING OUT FIRST THING THEY LET 
NEW ZEALAND OFF THE HOOK ON THE 
FIRST DAY RYAN SIDEBOTTOM HAD 
JACOB ORAM CAUGHT BEHIND HE HAD 
BUILT STUP ORN PARTNERSHIP WITH 
CAPTAIN DANIEL VETTORI STUBBORN 
BUT RYAN SIDEBOTTOM WAS IN THE MOOD 
MILLS WAS NEXT IN THE FIRING LINE 
VETTORI WAS HANGING IN THERE SOME 
OF HIS PLAY WAS QUITE SPECIAL 
SIDEBOTTOM DID FOR HIM TOO THOUGH 
THE NEW ZEALAND'S TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN QUITE 
RESPECTABLE CONSIDERING THE START 
THEY MADE ON THE FIRST DAY BUT 
PLAYING CRICKET IN ENGLAND IN MAY 
IS A PERILOUS BUSINESS BAD LIGHT 
REGULARLY STOPPED PLAY SPECTATORS 
WERE FORCE TO DO FIND OTHER THINGS 
TO OCCUPY THEIR TIME BIRD WATCHING 
OR MAYBE WATERCOLOURS COOK AND 
STRAUSS ADDED RUNS WHEN THEY GOOD 
IT WAS FRUSTRATING DAY FOR ALL AT 
LORDS LORDS THERE WERE A COUPLE OF GAMES IN THE 
SUPER LEAGUE LAST NIGHT LEADERS 
LEEDS BEAT WAKEFIELD FIFTY EIGHT TO TWELVE 
WARRINGTON LED FOURTEEN TO EIGHT AT THE BREAK

MIKE BUSHILL HAS BEEN BUSY DOING 
HIS FIRST T. V. AND RADIO INTERVIEW 
WITH THE RUSSIAN OWNER OF 
PORTSMOUTH ALEXANDRE GAYDAMAK HE 
GAVE SATURDAY BREAKFAST AN 
EXCLUESIVE INTERVIEW IN THE NAVAL 
DUKE OF YORK YARD HE SAID HE WANTS 
THE CITY'S HERITAGE TO BE VERY MUCH 
PART TO WHICH FUTURE IN 
PORTSMOUTH'S HISTORIC DOCKYARD THE 
FUTURE TO WHICH CLUB LOOKS SECURE 
THIS IS ONE FOREIGN INVESTOR WHO 
INSISTS HE IS HERE FOR THE LONG 
TERM 
IT IS THE FACT THAT IT'S BEST TERM FOOTBALL LEAGUE IN THE WORLD I 
BELIEVE AND IF ONE HAS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE ONE 
SHOULD DO I'VE BEEN LIVING IN 
ENGLAND FOR OVER THIRTEEN YEARS NOW THE 
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING IT SINCE THE 
BEGINNING I JUST LOVE IT 
YOU CAN 
UNDERSTAND THE FAN IT'S CLUBS LIKE 
YOURS THAT MAYBE GET WORRIED 
THINKING SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE WE 
DON'T KNOW A LOT OF MONEY ARE 
THEY GOING TO PULL OUT AT SOME 
POINT 
I BELIEVE THAT STATISTICALLY POINT EVERY FOOTBALL CLUB IN THE HANDS OF 
A FOREIGN OWNER HAS PROGRESSED 
LET'S JUDGE PEOPLE BY THEIR ACTIONS 
NOT BY FIERCE OR RUMOURS THAT 
PEOPLE MIGHT ENTERTAIN 
TO GET TO A 
CUP FINAL WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FORM 
PORTSMOUTH TO WIN IN TERMS OF YOUR 
FUTURE AMBITION 
IT IS CRUCIAL 
BECAUSE FOOTBALL CLUBS ARE BUILT ON 
FUTURE AMBITION IT IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE FOOTBALL CLUBS ARE BUILT ON 
HISTORY AND THE AMOUNT OF 
SILVERWARE THEY HAVE IN THEIR 
BOARDROOM IT IS A UNIQUE TAUNT 
CUPS ARE THE PLACES WE CAN PERFORM 
HE PERSUADED HARRY REDKNAPP TO STAY 
EARLIER THIS SEASON 
WE HAVE THE 
BEST MANAGER FOR A CLUB LIKE OURS 
WE HAVE THE BEST MANAGER IN ENGLAND 
HOW QUICKLY CAN THE CLUB MOVE 
FORWARD

TOP FOUR

SUSPENDED POOR SOME TIME PAUL PAUL WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE PEOPLE THINK 
THIS WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN AND DO 
YOU KNOW IF THERE IS A PROBLEM 
WHAT MADE PEOPLE THINK THIS WATER 
WAS COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE 
THERE WAS REPORT THAT A LAKE HAD 
BURST ITS BANKS L. HEARD ABOUT TWENTY 
MINUTES BEFORE THE RUMOUR SPREAD 
AND THE CHAOS BEGAN L. COVERED THE 
TSUNAMI AND IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON FOR 
THE MEREST RUMOUR OF ANOTHER 
DISASTER COMING THIS WAY TO SPREAD 
PANIC THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE AN 
ENTIRE COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN SHAKEN 
TO THEIR VERY CORE THEY ARE ON THE 
ALAN JOHNSON THEY ARE SKITTISH 
THERE ARE BUILDINGS TROD TOPPLE 
OVER THE MERE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT COMING THEIR WAY HAS JUST 
SEWN SEEDS OF DESPAIR THIS TOWN IS 
NOW PRETTY MUCH A GHOST TOWN APART 
FROM THE FEW OF THE ARMY AND RESCUE 
WORKERS STANDING AROUND ME THAT I 
THINK HAVE THE MESSAGE THAT THIS IS 
A RUMOUR EVEN KNOW THE RIVER MAY 
HAVE BURST ITS BANK THERE IS NOT 
WATER COMING THIS WAY 
IT IS A DISTRESSING IMAGE WHERE 
INJURED PEOPLE ARE BEING LEFT TO 
FEND FOR THEMSELVES WHILE OTHERS 
FLEE IN THE FEAR OF WHAT MIGHT 
HAPPEN 
IT'S TERRIBLE WE WERE JUST HAPPEN FILMING A MAN THAT HAD BEEN TRAPPED 
ALL OF THIS TIME HE IS BURIED 
UNDER A THICK LAYER OF CONCRETE AND 
THE RESCUERS LEFT HIM IT MAKES 
COMPLETE SENSE BECAUSE IF THERE 
HAD BEEN A WAVE COMING HE WOULD 
NOT HAVE SURVIVED THEY NEED THE 
PEOPLE WITH THIS EXPERTISE TO SAVE 
PEOPLE EVACUATING THE TOWN WAS THE 
ONLY SENSIBLE THING TO DO I'D FIND 
I THINK WE'LL FIND THAT WITHIN 
THE NEXT MINUTES AND HOURS PEOPLE 
WILL COME BACK DOWN AGAIN THIS IS 
AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN 
TRAUMATISED AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND 
THEM ACTING IN THIS WAY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT THOSE 
FEARS THAT WATER WAS HEADING DOWN 
THE VALLEY WHERE HERE'S A LOT OF 
PANIC AS YOU HEARD NO EVIDENCE AT 
THE MOMENT THAT HAS HAPPENED THERE 
HAD BEEN ONGOING CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
VARIOUS DAMS THAT THERE HAD BEEN 
DAMAGED TO AND WATERS IN THOSE 
LAKES IF THERE IS ANY MORE NEWS 
WE WILL BRING IT TO YOU 
THAT IS OUR MAIN STORY THIS MORNING 
THOUSANDS FLEE IN BEICHUAN AFTER 
REPORTS A RIVER HAS BURST ITS BANKS 
IT COMES AS FOREIGN AID WORKERS 
ENTER CHINA TO LOOK FOR IT QUICKS 
SURVIVORS SURVIVORS CUTTING DOWN ON PLASTIC BAGS NOW 
SUPERMARKETS ARE ACCUSED OF 
DIVERTING ATTENTION AWAY FROM MORE 
SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
STILL TO COME DARLING'S NEW DEAL 
WHO WINS WHO LOSES NOW TAX RULES 
HAVE CHANGED AGAIN WE WILL BE 
FINDING OUT WITH MONEY BOX'S PAUL 
LEWIS LEWIS LET'S HAVE LOOK AT THE WEEKEND WEATHER 
GOOD MORNING COMPARED TO THE 
WARMTH MOST OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED 
IN THE PAST WEEK IT IS FEELING A 
LITTLE ON THE COOL SIDE IT WILL 
CONTINUE TO DO SO NOT A LOT OF 
SUNSHINE AROUND A LOT OF CLOUD 
AROUND THE U. K. AND A FAIR BIT OF 
DAMP WEATHER AS WELL WE HAVE 
LIVELY SHOWERS IN THE SOUTH WEST 
CORNER THERE COULD BE HEAVY 
THUNDERY DOWNPOURS SHOWERS ARE 
NUDGING INTO THE SOUTH WEST CORNER 
MAINLY SHOWERY SUNSHINE TO THE FAR 
NORTH OF SCOTLAND THAT IS 
DEVELOPING ACROSS EASTERN AREAS 
PERHAPS A TINY BIT OF BRIGHTNESS AT 
TIMES TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST BUT 
HERE THE SHOWERS WILL BE SLOW 
MOVING AND POTENTIALLY TORRENTIAL 
COOL AT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN DEGREES AS WELL 
BE THE CASE ACROSS WALES HERE THE 
SHOWERS ARE LITTLE MORE HIT AND 
MISS DRY WEATHER AGAIN FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND COMPARED TO THE 
SUNSHINE WE HAVE SEEN THIS WEEK IT 
IS COOLER CLOUDIER ONE OR TWO 
SHOWERS POSSIBLE SOUTHERN PARTS OF 
SCOTLAND IT WILL HAVE EASED OFF 
INTO THE AFTERNOON SUNSHINE 
DEVELOPING THROUGH THE NORTH STILL 
RATHER COOL AND THE NORTH EASTERLY 
WIND STILL A BIT OF RAIN IN THE 
NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND WE WILL SEE 
SOME SUNSHINE TOWARDS THE NORTH SEA 
COAST INCREASING AMOUNTS OF 
SHOWERY RAIN TO WAS THE SOUTH EAST 
CORNER IF YOU AFTER WEMBLEY YOU 
COULD GET WET AT SOME POINT DURING 
THE AFTERNOON AS THE SHOWERS 
PUSHING THERE WILL BE 
INTERRUPTIONS I SUSPECT AT LORD'S 
THE RAIN SHARI HIT AND PLACE 
HIT AND MISS IN SOME PLACES 
SHOWERY MOST OF US WILL HAVE A 
DRIVE NIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL DIP 
AWAY LOW ENOUGH FOR A TOUCH OF 
GRASS FROST IN NORTHERN ENGLAND 
EVEN AN ISOLATED AIR FROST IN PARTS 
OF SCOTLAND THE REASON IS WE ARE 
DRAGGING THE ARYAN FROM THE NORTH 
EVEN THOUGH WE GET OFF ON QUITE A 
SUNNY NOTE COMPARED WITH TODAY IT 
WILL BE A CORE MACRO ONE OUT OF 
THE BREEZE IN THE SUNSHINE IT 
SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO BAD COOL 
CLOUD BUILDS UP AND THEN SPREAD 
OUT A LITTLE BIT COMPARED TO TODAY 
IT WILL BE DRY AND BRIGHT ANY 
SHOWERS LIMITED TO PARTS OF CENTRAL 
SCOTLAND EVEN THOSE SHOULD BE FEW 
AND FAR BETWEEN TEMPERATURES TWELVE 
SIXTEEN DEGREES THAT IS A GOOD TEN TO THIRTEEN 
DEGREES LOWER THAN LAST WEEKEND 
AFTER THE RAIN TODAY AT LEAST 
TOMORROW HAS A BIT MORE SUNSHINE 
FOR MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLE ON 
VERY LOW INCOMES WILL STILL PAY 
MORE TAX THIS YEAR DESPITE THE 
CHANCELLOR'S PLANS TO SPEND 
BILLIONS OF POUNDS ON REBATES 
THOSE WHO ORIGINALLY LOST THE MOST 
WHEN THE TEN P. TAX BAND WAS SCRAPPED 
WILL END UP PAYING ONE PER WEEK MORE 
THIS WEEK THAN LAST PAUL LEWIS IS 
FROM THE MONEY BOX PROGRAMME 
HAVE TO ADMIT IT 
IS CONFUSING IT IT IS ALL NUMBERS AND IT IS DIFFICULT 
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T DO IT 
WE ARE 
NOT HOLDING NEW RESPONSIBLE 
PERHAPS YOU CAN EXPLAIN THE 
CHANCELLOR HAS CHOSEN A SPECIFIC 
WAY TO COMPENSATE PEOPLE 
HE HAS 
DECIDED TO PUT UP THE PERSONAL TAX 
ALLOWANCE THE POINT AT WHICH WE 
START PAYING INCOME TAX BY SIX HUNDRED 
THAT WILL MEAN BECAUSE WE PAY TAX 
AT TWENTY PER CENT IT WILL MEAN AN EXTRA ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
FOR ALL BASIC RATE TAXPAYERS THAT 
WILL BE IN THEIR PAY PACKETS 
STARTING IN SEPTEMBER HE HAS CUT 
THE TAX FOR BASIC RATE TAXPAYERS 
ABOUT TWENTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE BY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
PER YEAR THAT IS HIS WAY OF 
COMPENSATING THE LOWER PAID PEOPLE 
WHO WERE GOING TO END UP PAYING 
MORE TAX 
DOES IT COMPENSATE THE 
LOSERS 
IT COMPENSATES MOST OF THEM LOSERS THE VERY LOW PAID PEOPLE ON ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE A 
WEEK ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED A YEAR THEY ARE 
STILL GOING TO BE LOSING A POUND A 
WEEK THERE WILL BE PAYING ONE A 
WEEK MORE TAX THIS YEAR THAN LAST 
BECAUSE THEIR LOSSES WERE MORE THAN 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY IT DOESN'T QUITE COMPENSATE 
THEM ALTHOUGH HE IS COMPENSATING 
FOR MILLION OF THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD 
HAVE PAID MORE TAX THIS YEAR THERE 
ARE ABOUT ONE MILLION OF THE 
LOWEST PAID OR LOWEST INCOMES 
WHICH INCLUDES A LOT OF PENSIONERS 
AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE RETIRED UNDER 
THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE THEY WILL STILL BE 
PAYING A BIT MORE TAX MAYBE UP TO 
ONE A WEEK 
MEANWHILE THIS WHOLE 
PLAN IS COSTING ALMOST THREE BILLION 
BUT THE COST OF IT IS MORE THAN IT 
WOULD COST TO COMPENSATE EVERYONE 
WHO LOST OUT 
IF YOU COULD HAVE 
PICKED OUT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO 
LOST AND JUST GAVE THEM WHAT THEY 
LOST IT WOULD HAVE COST A LOT LESS 
PROBABLY LESS THAN ONE BILLION WHY WHY WASN'T THAT DONE 
IT WAS MUCH MORE 
COMPLICATED FINDING THOSE PEOPLE 
AND GETTING THE MONEY TO THEM 
PERSONALLY IT WOULD HAVE COST A 
FORTUNE IN ADMINISTRATION THE 
CHANCELLOR NOW SAYS HE HAS ANOTHER 
REASON FOR GIVING AWAY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION 
THAT IS TO GIVE EVERYBODY A BIT OF 
A TAX BOOST THE ECONOMY IS IN THE 
DOLDRUMS IN AMERICA THEY GAVE 
EVERYBODY MONEY TO GO AND SPEND AND 
BOOST THE ECONOMY MOST PEOPLE WHO 
DID NOT LOSE ANYTHING THAT GOING TO 
GET ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY IN THEIR PAY 
PACKETS FROM SEPTEMBER SPREAD 
UNTIL NEXT YEAR IT GIVES EVERYONE 
A BIT OF A BOOST AND IT WILL HELP 
BOOST THE ECONOMY THAT IS HIS 
REASONING OR HIS EXCUSE L. THINK IT 
WAS JUST BECAUSE IT WAS TOO 
COMPLICATED AND EXPENSIVE TO TARGET 
THIS HEALTH HELD ON THE PEOPLE 
WHO NEEDED IT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A 
GENERAL CHANGE 
THANKS VERY MUCH 
INDEED IF YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS 
AND QUERIES MORE WILL BE EXPLAINED 
IN THE MONEY BOX PROGRAMME ON RADIO 
FOUR AT MIDDAY 
THE QUEEN'S ELDEST GRANDCHILD IS 
GETTING MARRIED TODAY PETER 
PHILLIPS THE SON OF PRINCESS ANNE 
WILL WED CANADIAN MANAGEMENT 
CONSULTANT AUTUMN KELLY THE BRIDE 
HAS GIVEN UP HER CATHOLIC FAITH TO 
MARRY INTO THE ROYAL FAMILY 
FOR FIVE YEARS IT HAS BEEN A 
DISCREET RELATIONSHIP THEIR 
COURTSHIP WITHOUT CONTROVERSY 
TOGETHER AT BADMINTON HORSE TRIALS 
ONE OF THE FEW TIMES THEY HAVE BEEN 
FILMED TOGETHER AUTUMN KELLY HAS 
GIVEN UP HER CATHOLIC FAITH AND 
BEEN WELCOMED INTO THE CHURCH OF 
ENGLAND IT ALLOWS PETER PHILLIPS 
TO RETAIN HIS PLACE AS ELEVENTH IN LINE 
TO THE THRONE INCREASINGLY AT EASE 
AS PART OF THE ROYAL PARTY SHE 
ATTENDED THIS YEAR'S EASTER SERVICE 
AT SAINT GEORGE'S CHAPEL IN WINDSOR 
THE VENUE FOR HER WEDDING TODAY 
THIS WILL BE A PRIVATE CEREMONY FOR 
AN ESSENTIALLY PRIVATE COUPLE BUT 
PETER PHILLIPS AND AUTUMN KELLY DID 
CHOOSE ONE VERY PUBLIC FORUM IN 
WHICH TO TALK ABOUT THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP THEY SOLD THEIR STORY 
TO A CELEBRITY MAGAZINE FOR A 
REPORTED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE INTERVIEW A 
DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HOW THE 
RELATIONSHIP FLOURISHED BUT THE 
SIDE OF THEIR STORY HAS RAISED A 
FEW EYEBROWS IN ROYAL CIRCLES I I DON'T THINK THEY WERE DESPERATELY 
HARD UP AND THEY NEEDED THE MONEY 
L. AM SURE IT IS VERY NICE BUT 
I 
THINK IT WAS ONE WAY OF GETTING IT 
ALL OUT IN THE OPEN WITHOUT HAVING 
TO REPEAT IT ENDLESSLY 
BROUGHT UP 
IN A SUBURB OF MONTREAL AUTUMN 
KELLY HAS DESCRIBED HER BACKGROUND 
AS NORMAL THOSE WHO KNOW HER 
BELIEVE SHE WILL COPE WELL AS A 
MEMBER OF THE ROYAL FAMILY 
SHE IS 
NOT ONLY INTELLIGENT AND VERY 
PRETTY SHE IS ALSO ONE OF THE BOYS 
SHE WILL STAND HER GROUND 
AS FOR 
THE GUESTS THEY WILL INCLUDE 
PRINCE HARRY AND HIS GIRLFRIEND 
FOR HER IT COULD BE THE FIRST 
INTRODUCTION TO THE QUEEN THERE 
WILL BE NO PRINCE WILLIAM HE IS 
ATTENDING A FRIEND'S WEDDING IN 
KENYA KATE MIDDLETON WILL 
REPRESENT THE COUPLE PERHAPS A 
SIGN OF THE GROWING SERIOUSNESS OF 
THAT MATCH THEY WILL MARRY AT FOUR P. M. 
THIS AFTERNOON THE ONE THING 
ADDING TO THE ROYAL BRIDE'S NERVES 
THE WORRIES ABOUT THE BRITISH 
WEATHER WEATHER YES SOMEONE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT 
THE QUEST TO FIND THE PERFECT MAN 
IS CHARLOTTE WARD YOU HAVE WRITTEN 
A BOOK ON THIS 
I HAVE 
STILL WITH 
THE HELLO THING THEY ARE SETTING A 
PRECEDENT HELLO MAGAZINE ROYAL WEDDING 
IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE WEDDING WHETHER OR NOT THE QUEEN WILL GO 
AHEAD AND BE IN THE PICTURES L. 
THINK IT WOULD BE QUITE REMARKABLY 
SHE WAS BUT BUCKINGHAM PALACE HAVE 
NOT SAID EITHER WAY L. GUESS THEY 
WILL HAVE TO GO AND LOOK AT HELLO 
THEY GUARD THEIR PICTURES VERY 
CLOSELY DON'T THEY THEY WILL HAVE 
THEIR OWN SECURITY PRESUMABLY 
WRAPPED UP WITH ALL OF THE ORDINARY 
SECURITY 
APPARENTLY THERE WILL BE SECURITY PICTURES ON THE WAY IN AND ON THE 
WAY OUT AGAIN HELLO WILL RELEASE 
A PICTURE IT IS ALWAYS REALLY WELL 
KEPT 
IF PRINCE PHILIP STARTS KEPT TAKING PICTURES THEY CAN'T 
REALLY THEY CAN'T STOP HIM CAN 
THEY THEY I DON'T KNOW L. SUPPOSE PEOPLE ARE 
ALLOWED TO TAKE PERSONAL 
PHOTOGRAPHS THE PROBLEM WOULD BE 
IF THEY STARTED SELLING THEM TO 
NEWSPAPERS WHICH I DON'T THINK 
PRINCE PHILIP WOULD DO LET'S ASK 
YOU ABOUT THIS STORY THAT 
APPARENTLY PETER PHILLIPS DID NOT 
TELL AUTUMN KELLY EXACTLY WHO HE 
WAS HIS BLUE BACKGROUND HIS ROYAL 
BACKGROUND ANY SECRETS YOU HAVE 
KEPT FROM BOY FRIENDS BECAUSE 
YOU'RE AFRAID IT MIGHT CHANGE HOW 
THEY LOOK AT YOU 
I WOULDN'T SAY I 
HAVE KEPT SECRETS L. THINK GIRLS 
QUITE A LOT DID THIS THING THAT 
THEY JUST MAYBE TRY TO BE A LITTLE 
BIT OF WHAT THEY THINK THE BOY 
FRIEND MIGHT LIKE WHEN THEY FIRST 
GO OUT WITH HIM WHEN I DID LOTS OF 
RESEARCH FOR MY BOOK I GOT SOME 
REALLY FUNNY STORIES OF GIRLS WHO 
FOUND OUT THINGS LIKE THEIR 
BOYFRIEND WAS AN AVID RUNNER SO 
THEY SHOWED A REAL INTEREST AND 
ENDED UP DOING MARATHONS AND THINGS 
THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE THAT 
NORMALLY ONE FRIEND HER BOYFRIEND 
WAS INTO SKYDIVING BECAUSE SHE 
WANTED TO SEEM LIKE SHE WAS UP FOR 
THAT KIND OF THING SHE FOUND 
HERSELF AGREEING TO THROW HERSELF 
OUT OF A PLANE 
THERE IS SOMETHING 
I FIND A BIT IMPLAUSIBLE THAT SHE 
WOULD NOT HAVE TWIGGED SOMEHOW WHO 
HE WAS YOU ASK SOMEONE QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THE FAMILY WHERE ARE YOU 
FROM SOME POINT IT WOULD HAVE 
EMERGED SURELY THE FIRST THING YOU 
DO IS GOOGLE AND CZECH WHO SOMEBODY 
IS 
THAT'S JUST ME A BIT WEIRD IT IS IS A BIT STRANGE YOU WOULD THINK 
THAT SHE WOULD HAVE MET FRIENDS OF 
HIS AND IT WOULD HAVE COME UP AT 
SOME STAGE HE SAID HE DIDN'T FEEL 
ANY NEED TO TELL HER RETORT SIX 
WEEKS DOWN THE LINE SHE WAS SAT AT 
HOME IN CANADA WATCHING TELEVISION 
WATCHING A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT PRINCE 
WILLIAM'S TWENTY FIRST BIRTHDAY AND THERE 
WAS PETER SHE WAS LIKE THAT GUY 
LOOKS A BIT LIKE PETER SHE 
REALISED IT WAS HER BOYFRIEND SHE 
WENT ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND HIM 
SHE WAS ACTUALLY QUITE UPSET L. 
THINK SHE REALISED THIS WAS QUITE A 
BIG THING HIM BEING PART OF THE 
ROYAL FAMILY SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT 
HOW THAT COULD COMPLICATE THE 
RELATIONSHIP SHE WAS A BIT ANGRY 
WITH HIM 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH 
WITH US THIS MORNING SAYING PETER 
SAID THAT ONE DAY HE FOUND OUT THAT 
HIS GIRLFRIEND WAS A RUSSIAN 
COUNTESS FROM PRE REVOLUTION DAYS 
THEREFORE UNFORTUNATELY SHE WAS 
BROKE AND STILL BROKE TWENTY YEARS ON 
BUT STILL TOGETHER YOU MIGHT WORRY 
THAT IF YOU TELL PEOPLE YOU HAVE 
SOME SORT OF HISTORY THERE MIGHT 
CHANGE THEIR VIEW OF YOU 
IN SOME 
WAYS IN A WAY I THINK IT IS QUITE 
SWEET THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW IT 
MEANT THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP COULD 
DEVELOP QUITE NORMALLY IT IS SUCH 
AN OVERBEARING THING OF COURSE 
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTED TO 
KNOW ALL ABOUT THE ROYALS PERHAPS 
HE DIDN'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT IT 
PERHAPS HE WANTED TO BE TAKEN AT 
FACE VALUE FOR THE PERSON THAT HE 
WAS IT IS QUITE SWEET THAT SHE 
DIDN'T KNOW 
HE IS A RELATIVELY 
LOW PROFILE ROLE NOT NOW 
COMING UP AN ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT 
OR A DISTRACTION FROM THE REAL 
ISSUE WE WILL BE ASKING IF WE HAVE 
BEEN CARRIED AWAY BY THE PLASTIC 
BAG DEBATE 
GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO 
BREAKFAST FROM B. B. C. NEWS WITH 
SUZANNA REID AND CHARLIE STAYT 
PANIC BREAKS OUT IN A TOWN 
DEVASTATED BY THE EARTHQUAKE IN 
CHINA AFTER REPORTS THAT A NEARBY 
RIVER HAS BURST ITS BANKS 
GOOD MORNING IT'S SATURDAY SEVENTEENTH 
MAY ALSO ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME 
GORDON BROWN ATTACKS BURMA'S 
INHUMAN RESPONSE TO CYCLONE 
NARGIS THE RED CROSS SAYS THE 
COUNTRY FACES CATASTROPHE OF 
STAGGERING PROPORTIONS AS THE 
SUPERMARKETS GET TOUGH ON PLASTIC 
BAGS THEY ARE ACCUSED OF DIVERTING 
ATTENTION FROM THEIR OWN WASTEFUL 
WAYS WAYS SUN SEA AND SURCHARGES WHY 
THOUSANDS OF HOLIDAY MAKERS ARE 
BEING ASKED TO PAY EXTRA FOR THEIR 
SURGE BREAK 
AND THE FANS ARE GATHERING HERE AT 
WEMBLEY FOR THE CUP FINAL WHICH NO 
ONE PREDICTED AS PORTSMOUTH TAKE 
ON CARDIFF 
AND THERE MIGHT BE ONE OR TWO NERVE 
IN THIS WINDSOR AS THE QUEEN'S 
GRANDSON PETER PHILIPS PREPARES 
FOR A ROYAL WEDDING 
PANIC HAS BROKEN OUT IN A TOWN 
DEVASTATED BY THE EARTHQUAKE IN 
CHINA BECAUSE OF FEARS OF FLOODING 
FROM A NEARBY RIVER THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE HAVE FLED BEICHUAN IN 
SICHUAN PROVINCE FOR HIGHER GROUND 
AFTER REPORTS THAT THE RIVER HAD 
BURST ITS BANKS A FEW MINUTES AGO 
WE GOT THE LATEST FROM PAUL DANAHAR 
WHO'S IN BEICHUAN 
A FEW MINUTES 
AGO THERE WAS COMPLETE PANIC AND 
CHAOS IN THIS TOWN EVERYONE START 
TO DO RUN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE 
STAMPEDING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE 
MAIN THOROUGHFARE HERE TRYING TO 
GET AWAY FROM WHAT THEY BELIEVED 
WAS A HUGE WAVE OF WATER AFTER 
REPORTS THAT A LOCAL RIVER HAD 
BURST ITS BANK AND THE WATER WAS 
COMING THIS WAY THE PLACE WENT 
FROM A SCENE OF RESCUE AND RELIEF 
INTO MAYHEM EVERYONE RAN THE 
ARMY THE AID WORKERS THE 
SURVIVORS THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO 
COME BACK TO COLLECT THEIR 
POSSESSIONS EVERYONE EVACUATED THE 
CITY THE PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS OF 
BEING RESCUED WERE LEFT BEHIND WE 
HAVE WALKED BACK DOWN AGAIN 
BECAUSE WE WERE TOLD BY CENTRAL 
CONTROL THAT IT WAS A RUMOUR THAT 
THE WATER WAS COMING THIS WAY AND 
THE TOWN IS DESERTED APART FROM A 
HANDFUL OF AID WORK ERST IT'S A 
TERRIBLE THING TO HAPPEN TO THIS 
TOWN BECAUSE THIS LATE INTO THE 
EARTHQUAKE TIME IS CRUCIAL AND 
MINUTES AND HOURS CAN MEAN PEOPLE'S 
LIVES AND THIS OPERATION MAY BE 
SUSPENDED FOR SOME TIME 
WHAT WAS 
IT THAT MADE PEOPLE THINK THIS WAS 
ABOUT TO HAPPEN WHAT MADE PEOPLE 
THINK THIS WATER WAS COMING DOWN 
THE MOUNTAINSIDE 
THERE WAS A 
REPORT THAT A LAKE HAD BURST ITS 
BANKS I HEARD THAT ABOUT TWENTY 
MINUTES BEFORE THE RUMOUR SPREAD 
AND THE SCAI OS BEGAN CHAOS BEGAN 
I COVERED THE TSUNAMI AND IT WAS 
NOT UNCOMMON FOR THE MEREST RUMOUR 
OF ANOTHER DISASTER COMING THIS WAY 
TO SPREAD PANIC THE PROBLEM IS YOU 
HAVE AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY HERE 
THAT'S BEEN ON THE THEIR VERY CORE 
THEY ARE ON THE EDGE THEY ARE 
SKITTISH EVERYWHERE AROUND THEM 
ARE BUILDINGS READY TO TOPPLE OVER 
AND THE MERE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT COMING THEIR WAY HAS SEWN 
SEEDS OF DESPAIR THIS TOWN IS NOW 
PRETTY MUCH A GHOST TOWN APART FROM 
A FEW OF THE ARMY AND RESCUE 
WORKERS WHO I THINK HAVE GOT THE 
MESSAGE THAT THIS IS A RUMOUR EVEN 
THOUGH THE RIVER MAY HAVE BURST ITS 
BANK THERE IS NOT WATER COMING THIS 
WAY 
THAT WAS PAUL DANAHAR SPEAKING WAY TO ME A FEW MOMENTS AGO WE'LL GO 
BACK FOR THE LATEST IN A FEW 
MINUTES MINUTES GORDON BROWN HAS ACCUSED THE 
BURMESE REGIME OF INHUMAN TREATMENT 
BY PREVENTING AID FROM GETTING 
THROUGH TO THE SURVIVORS OF CYCLONE 
NARGIS HE TOLD THE B. B. C. THE BURMESE 
GENERALS SHOULD BE HELD TO ACCOUNT 
FOR THE INTOLERABLE SITUATION 
OFFICIAL ESTIMATES PUT THE NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE DEAD OR MISSING AT 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND THE B. B. C. IS PREVENTED FROM 
REPORTING INSIDE BURMA OUR 
CORRESPONDENT CHRIS HOGG IS IN 
NEIGHBOURING THAILAND GOOD MORNING 
TO YOU CHRIS IT IS EXTREMELY 
STRONG WORDS COMING FROM GORDON 
BROWN INHUMANE TREATMENT AND 
SAYING THE JUNTA SHOULD BE HELD 
COMPANY B. T. WHAT IMPACT WILL THAT 
HAVE INSIDE BURMA 
YES HE WAS VERY 
CLEAR THE MESSAGE HE WAS TRYING TO 
SEND HE SAID WAS THIS NATURAL 
DISASTER RISKS BEING MADE INTO A 
MAN MADE CATASTROPHE BECAUSE OF THE 
INTRANSIGENCE OF THE GENERALS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE REFUSING TO ACCEPT 
THE AID THAT INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANISATIONS ARE OFFERING L. WOULD 
THINK INSIDE BURMA THEY WILL SHRUG 
THIS OFF AS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE 
PAST WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER IS 
SAYING IS THERE NEEDS TO BE 
CONCERTED PRESSURE NOT JUST FROM 
BRITAIN BUT FROM THE REST OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION THE REST OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND FROM 
BURMA'S NEIGHBOURS AND MOST OF ALL 
FROM THE COUNTRIES THAT BURMA 
REALLY LISTENS TO CHINA WHICH IN 
THE PAST HAVE HAD THE MOST 
INFLUENCE OVER THAT REGIME WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF INTERNATIONAL 
AID THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING ALLOWED 
IN HOW MANY INTERNATIONAL AID 
WORKERS ARE WORKING INSIDE BURMA 
AND WHAT ESTIMATES OF THE DEAD AND 
MISSING ARE THEY MANAGING TO 
ASSESS 
FIRST 
OF ALL ON THE AMOUNT ASSESS OF AID THAT'S GETTING IN THE 
ANSWER IS MUCH MORE THAN THERE WAS 
A WEEK AGO BUT BUT NOT ENOUGH THE 
INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS FOR 
INSTANCE HAS TOLD ME THEY HAVE SEVENTEEN 
FLIGHTS IN THIS WEEK OF WHICH THEY 
MANAGE TO DO GET SOME CARGO ON TO 
THEY SAY THAT'S ENCOURAGING BUT 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF FOOD 
AID THAT'S REQUIRED IT IS JUST A 
SEVERAL HUNDRED TONNES THAT HAVE 
GONE IN AND THEY NEED SEVERAL 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TONNES OF 
FOOD AID SO THEY ARE A LONG WAY 
SHORT OF WHAT THEY THINK THEY MIGHT 
NEED IN TERMS OF AN ACCURATE 
PICTURE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN 
NEED ON THE GROUND AGAIN VERY 
DIFFICULT TO SAY WE KNOW THAT 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE 
AT RISK TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE ARE MISSING L. HEARD FROM AN 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION IN 
RANGOON SAVE THE CHILDREN THEY 
BELIEVE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL AID 
AGENCYS THAT ARE WORKING THERE 
MANY OF THEM WITH LOCALLY HIRED 
STAFF HAVE MANAGE TO DO REACH 
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE IRRAWADDY 
DELTA A CONSIDERABLE ACHIEVEMENT 
BEARING IN MIND THE RESTRICTIONS 
THERE ARE NOT ALLOWING STAFF FOR 
EXAMPLE TO WORK IN THE DELTA AND 
HAVING TO RELY ON LOCALS THAT'S AN 
ACHIEVEMENT BUT THEY WOULD ADMIT 
THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT THEY NEED 
TO DO 
CHRIS THANK YOU 
I WANT TO BRING YOU SOME 
INFORMATION FROM CHINA THIS MORNING 
ONE PIECE OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION 
ABOUT THE DEATH TOLL IN ONE TOWN 
IT IS TWENTY THOUSAND AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE 
IN DAIYANG PAUL TAKE US THROUGH 
WHAT'S HAPPENED THERE 
I'M STANDING 
IN AN LISTEN DESOLATE BEICHUAN 
JUST HALF AN HOUR AGO IT WAS 
BUZZING WITH AID WORKERS MILITARY 
GUYS AND MILITARY TEAMS TRYING TO 
RESCUE PEOPLE THEN A RUMOUR SWEPT 
THIS CITY THAT WATER WAS ON ITS WAY 
FROM A RIVER THAT BURST ITS BANKS 
AND THERE WAS PANIC THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE RAN FOR HIGHER GROUND THE 
RELIEF AID HAD TO BE SUSPENDED THE 
PEOPLE IN THE 
WORKERS' POINT OF VIEW YOU WANT TO 
MAKE SURE YOU CAN KEEP THEM ALIVE 
AS IF THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER 
DISASTER YOU WOULD HAVE NEEDED THEM 
TO LOOK AFTER THE NEXT WAVE OF 
CASUALTIES EVERYONE HAD TO 
LEEFRPLT WE HAVE COME BACK DOWN 
AGAIN WITH THE FIRST TEAMS THAT 
WERE COMING IN BUT FROM'S JUST A 
COUPLE OF DOZEN OF THEM THE REST 
OF THE PLACE IS DESERTED THERE THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS ABOUT FEARS ABOUT 
FAST RISING WATER LEVEL IN THIS 
SOME OF THE LAKES NEARBY ALSO OF 
COURSE THE PURELY PRACTICAL ISSUE 
OF THE CRACKS IN SOME OF THE DAMS 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 
SITUATION WITH THE RISING WATER 
LEVELS 
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU TO CAUSE A 
MAJOR DISASTER YOU NEED A VERY 
QUICK MASSIVE GUSH OF WATER AND 
WATER LEVELS RISING YOU CAN MEASURE 
AND THEREFORE YOU CAN TAKE 
AGAINST IT BUT THE DAMS WERE 
OBVIOUSLY CAUSING PEOPLE A GREAT 
DEAL OF CONCERN BUT MOEF THOSE 
HAVE BEEN CHECKED AND WHERE REPAIRS 
WERE NEEDED THEY HAVE TAKEN PLACE 
I THINK THE CHINESE ARE CONFIDENT 
THAT THEY'VE SORTED THAT PROBLEM 
OUT THE REACTION OF THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT HERE HAS BEEN 
OVERWHELMING WITH THEY HAVE THROWN 
EVERYTHING AT THIS DISASTER THEY 
SIMPLY AREN'T TAKING ANY CHANCES 
THEY CAN'T BE FAULTED FOR THE AID 
OPERATION THEY'VE BEEN RUN 
SOMETHING FAR 
PAUL FOR THE MOMENT 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME 
THERE WERE FEARS THAT A RIVER THAT 
BURST ITS BANKS HAD CAUSED WATER TO 
RUN DOWN THE VALLEY 
THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY ON PLASTIC 
BAGS IS ALLOWING SUPERMARKETS TO 
PASS THE BUCK FOR CUTTING WASTE ON 
TO SHOPPERS THAT'S ACCORDING TO 
ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN 
ADVISERS PROFESSOR CHRIS COGGINS 
SAYS THE FOCUS ON CARRIER BAGS IS 
DIVERTING ATTENTION FROM FAR MORE 
PRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS AND 
IS CONFUSING CUSTOMERS BREAKFAST'S 
KEITH DOYLE HAS THIS REPORT IF YOU 
ARE DOING A SUPERMARKET SHOP THIS 
WEEKEND YOU MAY NOTICE A 
DIFFERENCE AT THE TILLS SINGLE USE 
PLASTIC BAGS ARE IN SHORTER FLY 
WITH MARKS AND AMP SPENCER CHARGING AND 
OTHER RETAILINGERS USING VARIOUS 
INVENTSIVES TO GET US TO REDUCE THE 
TWELVE POINT FIVE BILLION WE USE EVERY YEAR BUT 
WHY SO MUCH ATTENTION ON THE 
PLASTIC BAG ONE GOVERNMENT ADVISER 
THINK IT'S GOVERNMENT IS 
OVERREACTING AND SUPERMARKETS ARE 
PASSING THE BUCK TO CUSTOMERS THEY THEY HAVE PURCHASING POWER THEY HAVE 
POWER IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY BUY AND 
HOW IT IS PACKED THE PROBLEM IS BY 
FOCUSING ON THE CONSUMER END THEY 
ARE GIRTDING ATTENTION FROM WHAT 
THEY SHOULD BE DOING THE PUBLIC 
SEE PLASTIC BAGS AS AN ISSUE BUT IN 
REALITY THEY ARE A VERY SMALL 
PROPORTION OF THE WASTE THEY ARE A 
VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF OIL THAT 
THEY USE AND THEREFORE IN OVERALL 
RESOURCE TERMS IT IS A VISUAL THING 
RATHER THAN A MAINSTREAM ISSUE THE THE GOVERNMENT'S PUT PRESSURE ON 
RETAILERS AND SUPERMARKETS GIVING 
THEM AN ULTIMATUM TO REDUCE PLASTIC 
BAG USE BY A QUARTER OR FACE TAXES 
IT'S ALREADY MAKING PROVISION FOR A 
BAG TAX IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE BILL 
GOING THROUGH PARLIAMENT NOW 
RETAILERS SAY FOCUSING ON BAGS IS 
WASTING THEIR TIME 
THERE ARE A LOT 
OF VERY IMPORTANT PROVISIONS WITHIN 
THE CLIMATE CHANGE BILL THAT WE DO 
SUPPORT WE THINK THIS IS A RATHER 
TRIVIAL ISSUE TO ADD ON TO IT IT 
IS NOT JUST A SLEDGEHAMMER IT IS 
USING A STEAMROLL TORE CRACK A 
WALNUT IT IS NOT THE BEST USES OF 
RESOURCES IN TERMS OF ALL THE 
ISSUES WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING 
THIS WASTE IS DESTINED FOR LANDFILL 
SITES BUT LESS THAN TWO PER CENT OF WHAT GOES 
INTO LANDFILL IS PACKAGING AND ONLY 
A FACTS AND FIGURES OF THAT IS MADE 
UP OF PLASTIC BAGS THE GOVERNMENT 
ADMITS TAXING PLASTIC BAG S. S. 
UNLIKELY TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT 
IMPACT ON WASTE BUT SAYS THAT IS 
NOT THE POINT 
WE KNOW THE PUBLIC 
IS ON OUR SIDE THEY WANT ACTION 
AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO TAKE 
THAT A IT MAY BE A VERY SMALL PART 
OF THE WASTE STREAM BUT IT IS 
SYMBOLIC OF OUR THROW AWAY SOCIETY 
SO WE DO NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO 
CURB THEIR USE 
THE GOFPT MAY HOPE 
THAT PLASTIC THE GOVERNMENT MAY 
MOPE THAT PLASTIC BAG GUILT WILL 
MAKE PAUS MORE ECOFRIENDLY BUT 
USING THEIR USE OR THE EYESORE THEY 
CAUSE CAN BE NO BAD THING 
IN A FEW MINUTES WE'LL BE SPEAKING 
TO THE CARRIER BAG SCORTDIUM AND 
THE GREEN PARTY ABOUT THAT STORY

TOWN IN CHINA AFTER REPORTS A RIVER 
HAS BURST ITS BANKS IT COMES AS A 
FOREIGN AID WORKERS ENTER THE 
COUNTRY FOR THE FIRST TIME LOOKING 
FOR EARTHQUAKE SURVIVORS 
CUTTING DOWN ON PLASTIC BAGS BUT 
NOW SUPERMARKETS ARE ACCUSED OF 
DIVERTING ATTENTION AWAY FROM MORE 
SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
WE HAVE ACTUALLY GOT A LITTLE BIT 
OF RAIN AROUND THIS MORNING TO 
BEGIN THE WEEKEND LET ME SHOW YOU 
THE LATEST REIGN FULL PICTURE THIS 
IS WHERE THE RAIN HAS BEEN FALLING 
DURING THE DAY ACROSS SCOTLAND IT 
HAS BEEN A WET START THE SAME FOR 
NORTH WEST ENGLAND AND NORTH WALES 
SHOWERS GATHERING TO THE SOUTH EAST 
AND SOME LIVELY DOWNPOURS PUSHING 
INTO THE SOUTH WEST EVEN IF YOU 
HAVE NOT GOT THE RAIN A LOT OF 
CLOUD AROUND IT IS COOL IF NOT 
COLD THERE IS SOME SUNSHINE AND 
THE FASTS IN THE FAR NORTH OF 
SCOTLAND THE ODD BRIGHT PATCH 
ELSEWHERE A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS 
NORTHERN ENGLAND INTO THE MIDLANDS 
THESE ARE HIT AND MISS GRADUALLY 
GATHERING TOWARDS THE SOUTH EAST 
CORNER STILL THERE'S HEAVY AND 
POTENTIALLY THUNDERY DOWNPOURS TO 
COME TO THE SOUTH WEST THEY ARE 
SLOW MOVING THEY COULD BE 
TORRENTIAL AND PLACES A LOT OF 
SURFACE WATER AROUND I SUSPECT 
EVEN TOWARDS WALES THE ODD HEAVY 
DOWNPOUR STILL SOME DRY AND BRIGHT 
WEATHER WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUD 
IN THE SKIES AFTER A LOVELY WEEK 
WHEN WE HAVE SEEN THE SUNSHINE 
ALMOST EVERY DAY IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND A LOT MORE CLOUD TODAY 
COOL AT THIRTY DEGREES REMAINING 
CLOUDY ACROSS THE WEST NORTHERN 
AND EASTERN AREAS CONTINUE TO 
BRIGHTEN UP AT LONG LAST A BIT OF 
SUNSHINE FOR THE NORTH SEA COAST 
ONE OR TWO SHOWERS DOTTED HERE AND 
THERE MORE AND THE WHERE SHOWERS 
PUSHING INTO THE SOUTH EAST CORNER 
SOME OF THOSE COULD BE HEAVY AND 
THUNDERY IF YOU AFTER THE F. A. CUP 
FINAL YOU MAY GET WET BEFORE AFTER 
THE MATCH LIKE YESTERDAY AT LORD'S 
IT IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER ONE OF 
THOSE DAYS INTERRUPTIONS ON AND 
OFF AS THE RAIN COMES AND GOES 
MOST OF THE RAIN ACROSS SOUTHERN 
AREAS WILL CONTINUE TO SINK 
SOUTHWARDS BECOMING CONFINED TO 
THE SOUTH WEST AND THE ENGLISH 
CHANNEL OVER THE OR OVERNIGHT 
PERIOD EVERYTHING ELSE TURNS DRY 
AND THAT LITTLE BIT CLEARER 
TEMPERATURES ARE GOING TO GET AWAY 
LOW ENOUGH FOR A TOUCH OF GRASS 
FROST IN NORTHERN ENGLAND AND EVEN 
A SHELTERED AIR FROST ACROSS PARTS 
OF SCOTLAND A CHILLY START 
COMPARED TO TODAY BUT IT SHOULD BE 
A LOVELY SUNNY ONE IT WILL 
GRADUALLY CLEARER WAY ICE CROPPING 
UP IN SCOTLAND THOUGH SUNSHINE 
GRADUALLY GIVING AWAY TOO CLOUDY 
CONDITIONS IN THE AFTERNOON 
TEMPERATURES IN THE SUNSHINE NOT 
TOO BAD DOWN ON WHAT WE HAD LAST 
WEEK BUT A LITTLE WAR MORE THAN 
WHAT WE HAVE TODAY WARMER AT 
LEAST TODAY THE RAIN IS GOOD FOR 
THE GARDENERS 
FOR MANY SHOPPERS KEEN TO BE GREEN 
TAKING A PLASTIC CARRIER BAG TO THE 
TALE IS A DEFINITE NO NO BUT HOW 
SIGNIFICANT IS PLASTIC BAG WASTE ON 
THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEMS FACING 
THE ENVIRONMENT LET'S SPEAK TO 
PETER WOODALL FROM THE CARRIER BAG 
CONSORTIUM ALSO TO DARREN JOHNSON 
A LONDON ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE 
GREEN PARTY A GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
BOTH IF I COULD JUST ASK YOU FIRST 
PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE REAL 
PROBLEM WITH PLASTIC BAGS PERHAPS 
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE PROBLEM ARE 
WE WORRIED BECAUSE THEY CONTRIBUTE 
TO LANDFILL ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT 
THEM BECAUSE OF THE LITTER MENACE 
OR IS IT BECAUSE THEY CONTRIBUTE TO 
THE DEATH OF MARINE LIFE WHAT IS 
THE MAJOR CONCERN 
I CONDUCTED A 
MAJOR INVESTIGATION ON THIS FOR THE 
LONDON ASSEMBLY ONE OF THE MAIN 
CONCERNS IS LANDFILL WE PRODUCE THIRTEEN 
BILLION OF THESE THINGS EVERY YEAR 
MOST OF THEM END UP IN LANDFILL AND 
THEY CAN TAKE SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS 
TO BUY A DEGRADE L. AM NOT GOING TO 
PRETEND IT IS THE BIGGEST 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM EVER FIGURES FIGURES SHOW THAT PLASTIC IS TWO PER CENT AND OH TWO PER CENT 
OF LANDFILL IS PLASTIC BAGS THAT 
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A HUGE AMOUNT 
IT IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY VISIBLE 
SYMBOL OF THE THROWAWAY SOCIETY 
THE EXPERIENCE IN THE NORTHERN 
IRELAND SHOWED THAT WHEN THEY 
INTRODUCED THEIR CARRIER BAGS LEVY 
IT HAD KNOCK ON EFFECT ON 
CONSUMER ATTITUDES ON A WHOLE RANGE 
OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND PEOPLE 
GOT MORE CONSCIOUS ABOUT PACKAGING 
RECYCLING AND SO ON RATHER THAN AS 
BEING DIVERSIONARY IT WAS ACTUALLY 
IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND VERY 
GOOD AT GETTING PEOPLE THINKING 
GREEN ON A RANGE OF ISSUES PETER PETER WOOD ALL YOU ARE FROM THEIR CAREER 
BANK CONSORTIUM WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT 
A CARRIER BAG 
ACROSS A LIFE CYCLE THE PLASTIC 
BAG IS ACTUALLY THE BEST 
ENVIRONMENTAL CHOICE YOU CAN MAKE 
YOU CAN RE USE AND KEEP ON 
RECYCLING IT HAS THE LOWEST 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WHAT IS 
DANGEROUS IS WHEN THE ENVIRONMENT 
MINISTER HAS WHIPPED THE WHOLE 
COUNTRY INTO HYSTERIA ON THE ISSUE 
OF PLASTIC BAGS WHEN IN FACT THE 
IRISH EXPERIENCE WHICH THE GUEST 
HAS JUST MENTIONED SHOWS ABSOLUTELY 
THAT MORE PLASTIC IS USED IN 
IRELAND AFTER THE TAX THAN BEFORE 
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO START 
BUYING BIN BAGS ON A ROLL WHERE 
SACKS BAGS TO PUT NAPPIES IN 
BAXTER BUT DOG DROPPINGS IN MORE 
PLASTIC IS BEING USED BAGS TO 
PUT 
THE IF NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS PUT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF PLASTIC 
BAGS MAKES PEOPLE THINK GENERALLY 
ABOUT WASTE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO 
THINGS THAT IS A GOOD THING ISN'T 
IT IT THEY ARE IS NOT A SCRAP OF EVIDENCE 
IN THE WORLD THAT TAXING PLASTIC 
BAGS AND ISN'T IT INTERESTING THAT 
POLITICIANS HAVE THEIR VOCAB REAL 
ONE WORD TAX MAYBE TWO BAN 
THERE ISN'T SCRAP OF EVIDENCE 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT TAXING 
PLASTIC BAGS CHANGES PEOPLE'S 
IRRESPONSIBLE HABITS TO THINGS LIKE 
LETTERING WE HAVE REALLY GOT TO 
HAVE NATIONAL EDUCATION CAMPAIGN 
ON LITTERING ON IRRESPONSIBLE 
LITTERING FORGET THIS ISSUE OF 
PLASTIC BAGS WHICH IS A PURE 
POLITICAL DIVERSION AND AN 
OPPORTUNITY FOR ANOTHER STEALTH TAX 
WHAT DO YOU SAY 
I THINK IT IS SAD 
THAT THE CARRIER BAG INDUSTRY IS 
JUST FIGHTING THIS SORT OF WAR 
AGAINST WHAT IS INEVITABLE 
CONSUMERS WANT TO GET RID OF 
PLASTIC BAGS THEY WANT TO START 
RE USING BAGS BUT WE DO NEED A BIT 
OF A STICK AS WELL AS A CARROT A 
LEVY HAS WORKED VERY SUCCESSFULLY 
IN IRELAND L. WOULD APPLY IT TO 
PAPER BAGS AS WELL IT IS SINGLE 
USE BANKS THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM 
WITH WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE 
TO GET REUSABLE BAGS CLOTH BAGS 
AND USE THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN A A LOT OF CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING WHY IS 
SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON THE CONSUMER 
WHEN THE PRODUCERS AND THE 
SUPERMARKETS CREATE SO MUCH PLASTIC 
PACKAGING WE HAVE GOT SOME 
EXAMPLES HERE A CARRIER BAG THIS 
IS A BRITISH LETTUCE IT CAME IN 
TWO TRAYS TWO PLASTIC TRAYS AND A 
PLASTIC COVER IT SEEMS EXCESSIVE 
PACKAGING FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF 
LETTUCE 
ABSOLUTELY L. TOTALLY LETTUCE AGREE WE ACTUALLY NEED TOUGHER 
REGULATIONS ON ALL SORTS OF 
PACKAGING I THINK THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE CONCENTRATED 
ON THAT AS WELL 
HOW COME THE 
PRESSURE SEEMS TO BE FOCUSED ON THE 
CUSTOMER WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO 
DO THEIR BEST WITH INCREASING 
NUMBER OF PLASTIC BAGS AND MORE 
PRESSURE IS NOT BEING PUT ON 
SUPERMARKETS TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF 
STUFF GOING INTO THE BAGS 
I DON'T 
THINK A LEVY ON PLASTIC BAGS IS 
PUTTING UNDUE PRESSURE ON CUSTOMERS 
THEY HAVE STILL GOT THE OPTION TO 
BUY A BAG OF THEY ARE CAUGHT SHORT 
THEY JUST HAVE TO PAY A LEVY THAT 
IS WORKING WELL IN IRELAND L. 
TOTALLY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO BE 
INTRODUCING TOUGHER REGULATIONS ON 
EXCESS PACKAGING L. AM SURE THERE 
WILL BE PEOPLE ON THE PACKAGING 
INDUSTRY WHICH SAYS THAT WILL BE 
TERRIBLE AND WE SHOULD BE REDUCING 
PACKAGING INDUSTRY WILL ALWAYS TRY 
TO STYMIE REGULATION BUT WE DO 
NEED TO MOVE FORWARD

YOU'RE WATCHING THAT'S ALL FOR NOW 
I'M IN THIRTY MINUTES GOODBYE 
THIS IS RELATING TO THE CHINESE 
TOWN OF BEICHUAN IN THE SICHUAN 
PROVINCE REPORTS THIS MORNING THAT 
A LAKE HAD BURST ITS BANKS FURTHER 
UP THE VALLEY WHICH CAUSED PANIC 
IN THE TOWN WE HAVE EYEWITNESS 
ACCOUNTS FROM OUR REPORTER WHO IS 
THERE PAUL DANAHAR HE REPORTED 
THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE TRYING 
TO HELP VICTIMS TRAPPED IN THE 
RUBBLE RAN FOYER THEIR LIVES AS 
PANIC SPREAD AMIDST REPORTS THAT 
WAVE OF WATER WAS COMING DOWN THE 
VALLEY IT APPEARS THAT THE WATER 
THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT DIDN'T COME 
DOWN THE VALLEY BUT EVERYONE RAN 
FOR THEIR ARRIVE LIVES AND LIVES 
AND HEFTY PEOPLE THEY WERE HELPING 
LEFT PEOPLE THEY WERE HELPING 
INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE ARE STILL BEING 
BROUGHT OUT OF THE RUBBLE ONE 
PERSON WAS BROUGHT OUT AFTER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN 
HOURS UNDER THE DEVASTATION KAUCHED 
BY THE EARTHQUAKE WE ARE NOW DISH 
CAUSED BY EARTHQUAKE WE WERE 
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW WHAT AN IMPACT 
A RUMOUR HAD HAVE 
GORDON BROWN HAS ACCUSED THE 
BURMESE REGIME OF INHUMANE 
TREATMENT HE TOLD THE B. B. C. BURMESE 
GENERALS WHO BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR 
THE INTOLERABLE SITUATION OFFICIAL 
ESTIMATES PUT THE NUMBER OF DEAD OR 
MISSING AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND 
A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL HAS BEEN KILLED 
IN A SUSPECTED HIT AND RUN ON 
MERSEYSIDE SHE WAS KNOCKED DOWN BY 
A VAN LAST NIGHT POLICE ARE 
QUESTIONING A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD MAN ON 
SUSPICION OF CAUSING DEATH BY 
DANGEROUS DRIVING 
THE HUSBAND OF A TELEVISION MAKE UP 
ARTIST DIANE CHENERY WICKENS HAS 
BEEN CHARGED WITH HER MURDER HER 
BODY WAS FOUND IN LITTLE HORSTED 
YESTERDAY THE CAUSE OF DEATH 
HASN'T BEEN ESTABLISHED DAVID HER 
HUSBAND IS TO APPEAR IN COURT TODAY 
FOR THE FIRST TIME 
TRAVEL COMPANIES SAY IT IS BECAUSE 
OF THE STRONG EURO AND THE RISING 
COST OF AIRLINE FUEL BUT THE 
CONSUMERS' ASSOCIATION SAYS THERE 
TO BE FAR MORE TRANSPARENCY IN HOW 
MUCH EXTRA CUSTOMERS HAVE TO PAY 
SUMMER HOLIDAYS ARE ALL ABOUT SUN 
SAND AND SEA BUT THIS YEAR THERE'S 
SOMETHING ELSE SURCHARGES SOME 
HOLIDAY COMPANIES ARE FORCING THEIR 
CUSTOMERS TO PAY MORE FOR THEIR 
SUMMER BREAK THEY BLAME IT ON THE 
STRENGTH OF THE EURO SO FAR TWENTY THREE 
HOLIDAY FIRMS ARE ASKING FOR EXTRA 
AND ABTA SAYS S. E. V. E. R. A L. ZERO ZERO ZERO HOLIDAY 
MAKERS ARE BEEN AFFECTED AT A TIME 
WHEN MANY FAXLIES FACE RISING COSTS 
ELSEWHERE IT IS A MOVE THAT'S NOT 
GOING DOWN WELL 
THE TRAVEL 
INDUSTRY IS THE ONLY ONE IN WHICH 
YOU CAN PAY FOR A PRODUCT MONTHS IN 
ADVANCE AND A MONTH BEFORE YOU ARE 
DUE TO AVAIL YOURSELF OF THAT 
PRODUCT OR SERVICE YOU ARE ASKED TO 
PAY EVEN MORE THEY THINK THE 
TRAVEL SHE SHOULD STOP PASSING SUR 
CHANNELLINGS ON TO CONSUMERS WHAT WHAT CAN COMPANIES MAKE THEIR CUSTOMERS 
PAY UNDER ABTA'S RULES THEY CAN 
CHARGE UP TO TEN PER CENT EXTRA BUT THEY 
MUST ABSORB THE FIRST TWO PER CENT THEY CAN 
ASK FOR EXTRA MONEY TO PAY FOR AIR 
FUEL AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BUT 
CAN'T ASK FOR THE MONEY IF IT IS 
LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS BEFORE DEPARTURE 
THOMAS COOK AND TUI SAY THINK WON'T 
CHARGE EXTRA BUT OTHERS HAVEN'T 
GIVEN THIS GUARANTEE THE PROVIDING PROVIDING THE COMPANY IN QUESTION HAS CLEARED 
WITH ABTA THEY CAN IMPOSE A SUR 
CHANNELLING IF THEY'VE ABSORBED 
THE FIRST TWO PER CENT YOU DOEN REALLY HAVE 
A CHOICE SURCHARGE 
HOLIDAYS ARE 
ALWAYS EXPENSIVE SO EVEN IF YOU 
ARE ONLY ASK TO DO PAY SURCHARGE OF 
A FEW PER CENT EXTRA IT CAN MAKE A 
REAL DENT IN YOUR HOLIDAY MONEY 
BUT SOME SMALLER TOUR OPERATORS 
BELIEVE THERE IS NO REASON TO MAKE 
CUSTOMERS PAY A SURCHARGE IN THE 
FIRST PLACE 
OVER THE PAST FEW 
YEARS THE POUND HAS BEEN STRONG SO 
WE LIKE OTHER S. HAVE DONE WELL BUT BUT THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY SAYS COMPANIES 
MUST HAVE THE OPTION OF SURCHARGES 
AND REJECTS THE SUGGESTION THEY ARE 
NOT BEING OPEN 
YES IT IS QUITE TRANSPARENT IT 
MIGHT BE IN THE SMALL PRINT IN THE 
BROCHURES BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF 
ISSUES TUCKED AWAY IN THERE TOO SO 
YES THERE ARE RULES GUIDELINES 
AND THEY'VE BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO 
PROTECT THE CUSTOMER 
SO A. R. MOST 
TRAVEL FIRMS AREN'T ADDING A 
SURCHARGE BUT THEY COULD DO SO IN 
TIME FOR SUMMER ESPECIALLY IF THE 
POUND STARTS TO FALL AGAIN AGAINST 
THE EURO 
THE TRAVEL WRITER ALISON RICE IS 
HERE 
GOOD MORNING 
IT IS A WORRY HERE FOR PEOPLE ON TIGHT BUDGETS AT THE 
MOMENT THE FACING THE FACT THAT 
THEIR HOLIDAY WHICH THEY THOUGHT 
THEY HAD BUDGETED FOR AND ACCOUNTED 
FOR MAY GO UP IS THIS GOING UP 
MORE COMMONLY 
IT IS THIS YEAR TWENTY THREE 
TOUR OPERATORS HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR 
PUTTING UP SURCHARGES LAST YEAR IT 
WAS ONLY NINE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS 
HUGE RISE IN THE STRENGTH OF THE 
EURO AGAINST THE POUND AND THE COST 
OF FUEL SINCE THE EIGHTY SO AT SHOCK 
IT IS ALL COVERED SADLY IN THE 
SMALL PRINT WHEN YOU BUY A PACKAGE 
TOUR BUT NOT MANY OF US READ THE 
SMALL PRINT DO WE 
NO AND PERHAPS 
THAT'S A LESSON FOR US MICHAEL 
SAYS WHEN YOU BOOK A HOLIDAY AND 
PAY IN FULL IS THAT NOT A 
CONTRACT IF THE INSTALL PRINT 
CLAIMS TO ALLOW THE INCREASE 
DOESN'T IT MAKE IT AN UNFAIR 
CONTRACT 
I'M NOT A LAWYER THESE CONTRACT REGULATIONS CAME INTO FORCE WHEN 
THERE WAS SO MUCH SUR KA 
SURCHARGING IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE TOUR 
OPERATORS IF THEY ARE MEMBERS OF 
ABTA HAVE TO RUN IT BY ABTA WHO I 
ASSUME LOOK AT THE REASONS ABTA ABTA SAYS THEY MAKE PEOPLE JUMP THROUGH 
HOOPS BEFORE THEY PUT THE 
SURCHARGES ON COMPANIES PAY THE 
FIRST TWO PER CENT BUT THE EIGHT PER CENT THEY CAN PASS 
ON TO THE CUSTOMER I'M AFRAID EVEN 
IF YOU HAVE PAID IN FULL THEY ARE 
STPWIELT TO DO ASK FOR THIS EIGHT PER CENT IT 
IS A CASE OF PAY UP OR STAY AT HOME 
WHICH SURPRISES ME IF YOU CHOOSE 
NOT TO PAY YOU SACRIFICE ANY MONEY 
YOU'VE ALREADY PAID BECAUSE IT IS 
COVERED IN THE SMALL PRINT ONE 
TEXTER SAYS WHAT DO TRAVEL AGENTS 
DO WITH ALL THE INTEREST THEY MAKE 
ON THE MONEY YOU PAY FAR IN ADVANCE 
TO GET PERHAPS YOUR HOLIDAY SECURED 
OR MAYBE GET A LOWER PRICE AND ONE 
OTHER SHELLEY SAYS TOUR OPERATORS 
NEVER GIVE US MONEY BACK WHEN THING 
GOS TO OTHER WAY 
NO THERE IS NO 
OBLIGATION AND THEY DON'T IT IS 
FAIR TO SAY THAT THE BIG TWO MASS 
MARKET TOUR OPERATORS THOMAS COOK 
AND TUI AREN'T CHARGING SURCHARGES 
ON THEIR PACKAGE HOLIDAYS BUT THEY 
ARE ON THEIR FLY ONLYS THEY BUY 
THEIR HOLIDAYS IN VAFPBLTS THE 
SMALLER COMPANIES CAN'T DO THAT 
MOST OF US ORGANISE OUR OWN HOLIDAY 
AND PEOPLE WHO BUY FLIGHTS WILL 
KNOW ALL ABOUT SURCHARGES THAT 
AIRLINES ARE PUTTING ON BANKS NINE 
HOURS OR LONGER FLIGHTS SURCHARGE 
IS NOW ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT RETURN BRITISH 
AIRWAYS AIRWAYS CELINA TELL US ABOUT THE F. A. CUP

PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE THIS YEAR IT IS

INSTEAD WE HAVE TWO TEAMS WITH NO

SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD BOY FROM CAERPHILLY IN 
WALES COULD MAKE HISTORY THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT WATCH OUT FOR THE NAME AARON 
RAMSEY HE IS SEVENTEEN THIS TIME LAST 
YEAR HE WAS TAKING HIS GCSES BUT 
IF HE PLAYS FOR CARDIFF AND CARDIFF 
WIN HE COULD BECOME THE YOUNGEST 
WINNER OF THE F. A. CUP IN THE HISTORY 
OF THE TOURNAMENT WHAT A DAY THAT 
WOULD BE FOR HIM CARDIFF HAVE LOTS 
OF EXPERIENCE TO GO WITH THEIR 
YOUNG TAL TENTS ROBBIE FOWLER HAS 
BEEN INJURED FOR A LOT OF THE 
SEASON BUT IS BACK TO FIT FINANCE 
HE MAY COME AN IN THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN

THEY'VE ALSO GOT JIMMY FLOYD 
HASSELBAINK WHO ACHIEVED SUCCESS 
WITH LEEDS AND CHELSEA HE SAYS HE

THE QUEEN'S ELDEST GRANDCHILD IS

GEORGE'S CHAPEL IN WINDSOR PETER 
PHILLIPS WILL WEAR TO THE CANADIAN 
MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT AUTUMN KELLY 
THE BRIDE HAS GIVEN UP HER CATHOLIC 
FAITH TO MARRY INTO THE ROYAL 
FAMILY FAMILY FOR FIVE YEARS IT HAS BEEN A 
DISCREET RELATIONSHIP A COURTSHIP 
WITHOUT CONTROVERSY TO GET AT 
BADMINTON HORSE TRIALS EARLIER THIS 
MONTH ONE OF THE FIRST TIME AS 
PETER PHILLIPS AND AUTUMN KELLY 
HAVE BEEN FILMS TOGETHER AHEAD OF 
HER MARRIAGE AUTUMN KELLY HAS 
GIVEN UP HER CATHOLIC FAITH AND 
BEEN WELCOMED INTO THE CHURCH OF 
ENGLAND IT ALLOWS PETER PHILLIPS 
TO RETAIN HIS PLACE AS ELEVENTH IN LINE 
TO THE THRONE 
INCREASINGLY AT EASE AS PART OF THE 
ROYAL PARTY SHE ATTENDED THIS 
YEAR'S EASTER SERVICE AT SAINT 
GEORGE'S CHAPEL IN WINDSOR THE 
VENUE FOR HER WEDDING TODAY 
THIS WILL BE A PRIVATE CEREMONY FOR 
AN ESSENTIALLY PRIVATE COUPLE BUT 
PETER PHILLIPS AND AUTUMN KELLY DID 
CHOOSE ONE VERY PUBLIC FORUM IN 
WHICH TO TALK ABOUT THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP THEY SOLD THEIR STORY 
TO A CELEBRITY MAGAZINE FOR A 
REPORTED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
THE INTERVIEW A DETAILED ACCOUNT 
OF HOW THE RELATIONSHIP FLOURISHED 
BUT THE SALE OF THEIR STORY HAS 
RAISED A FEW EYEBROWS IN ROYAL 
CIRCLES 
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE CIRCLES DESPERATELY HARD UP AND THEY NEEDED 
THE MONEY I'M SURE IT IS VERY NICE 
BUT IT WAS ONE WAY OF GETTING IT 
OUT IN THE OPEN WITHOUT HAVING TO 
REPEAT IT ENDLESSLY 
BROUGHT UP IN 
A SUBURB OF MONTREAL AUTUMN KELLY 
HAS DESCRIBED HER BACKGROUND AS 
NORMAL THOSE WHO KNOW HER BELIEVE 
SHE WILL COPE WELL AS A MEMBER OF 
THE ROYAL FAMILY 
SHE IS NOT ONLY 
INTELLIGENT AND VERY PRETTY SHE IS 
ALSO ONE OF THE BOYS SHE WILL 
STAND HER GROUND 
AS FOR THE GUESTS 
THEY WILL INCLUDE PRINCE HARRY AND 
HIS GIRLFRIEND CHELSEA FOR HER IT 
COULD BE A FIRST INTRODUCTION TO 
THE QUEEN THERE WILL BE NO PRINCE 
WILLIAM HE IS ATTENDING A FRIEND'S 
WEDDING IN KENYA KATE MIDDLETON 
WILL REPRESENT THE COUPLE PERHAPS 
A SIGN OF THE GROWING SERIOUSNESS 
OF THAT PARTICULAR MATCH PETER 
PHILLIPS AND AUTUMN KELLY WILL 
MARRY THIS AFTERNOON THE ONE THING 
ADDING TO THE ROYAL BRIDE'S NERVES 
HER WORRIES ABOUT THE BRITISH 
WEATHER WEATHER CHARLOTTE WARD WHO HAS WRITTEN A 
BOOK ON FINDING MR. RIGHT IS HERE 
AND BEST LET BEST SELLING 
CHOCOLATE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS THEY ARE 
GETTING MARRIED APPARENTLY PETER 
PHILLIPS DID NOT TELL AUTUMN KELLY 
THAT SHE WAS FROM ROYAL STOCK WE 
CAN ONLY SPECULATE WHY BECAUSE SHE 
MIGHT BE PUT OFF 
WHY WOULD SHE BE 
PUT OFF THE CHIEF APHRODISIAC FOR 
A WOMAN IS A CASTLE WE GROW UP ON 
THOSE FAIRY TALES AND WE THINK WE 
ARE GOING TO BE RESCUED BY A NIGHT 
IF I HAD BEEN HAIR I WOULD HAVE 
BEEN QUIET THAT I WAS CANADIAN 
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE QUIET 
ABOUT THAT 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY 
HE HE DIDN'T TELL HER 
IN CASE SHE 
ONLY LOVED HIM BECAUSE HE WAS TALL 
DARK AND WITH A BANK ACCOUNT WHAT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS IS IT LIKE A 
FAIRY TALE STORY ON THE FACE OF IT 
THIS THING OF NOT SAYING WHO YOU 
ARE ADDED HAPPENING ANYWAY IT'S 
RATHER DELIGHTFUL 
I THINK IT IS 
RATHER SWEET IT GAVE THEM A CHANCE 
TO KNOW EACH OTHER WITHOUT THAT 
GETTING INVOLVED THE FIRST THING 
YOU WOULD WANT TO KNOW IS ALL ABOUT 
THE ROYAL FAMILY 
FRANKLY I DON'T 
BELIEVE IT L. FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE SHE DIDN'T KNOW HE MIGHT 
NOT HAVE TOLD HER BUT I SUSPECT 
SOME HAD 
I UNDERSTAND WHY HE 
WOULD NOT WANT TO TELL HER WHO 
WOULD WANT TO MARRY INTO THE ROYAL 
FAMILY YOU WOULD BE THE EDMUND 
HILLARY OF SOCIAL CLIMBING AND 
THEY ARE ALL HYPHENATED WHO WOULD 
WANT TO BE IN THERE 
DO YOU WANT TO 
CONFESS TO ANYTHING YOU DIDN'T TELL 
YOUR PARTNER 
ALL OF MY BAD HABITS 
A FRIEND OF MINE GOT MARRIED 
RECENTLY AND SHE DID NOT KNOW UNTIL 
THE WEDDING DAY THAT HER HUSBAND 
HAD BEEN MARRIED TWICE BEFORE THAT 
IS KIND OF SCARY SHE POSTPONED THE 
WEDDING I DO THINK A MAN SHOULD 
TELL YOU HIS ENTIRE DATING HISTORY 
BEGINNING WITH PETS AND OTHER 
ANIMALS 
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF ANIMALS STORIES STEVE SAYS WE WERE 
MARRIED IN BRUSSELS SHE WAS TWENTY FOUR AND 
I WAS FIFTY SEVEN MONTHS AFTER WE 
MARRIED I FOUND OUT SHE IS THE 
HEIRESS TO A DIAMOND CORPORATION 
THAT CAN'T BE TRUE 
YOU WOULDN'T 
WANT TO SAY THAT YOU DON'T WANT 
PEOPLE TO MARRY YOU JUST FOR THE 
DIAMONDS DIAMONDS THE ISN'T THERE SOMETHING GOOD 
ABOUT HOLDING SOME STUFF BACK YOU 
DON'T WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING DO 
YOU 
I THINK YOU'RE BAD HABITS YOU YOU SHOULD CONFESS ALWAYS LOVE WITH A 
MAN BEFORE LIVE WITH A MAN BEFORE 
YOU MARRY HIM YOU NEED TO KNOW 
THESE THINGS 
NOT TOO SOON L. THINK 
YOU HAVE TO GET HIM HOOKED FIRST 
AND START TO DIVULGE THE BAD HABITS 
I THINK IT IS INTERESTING WHAT YOU 
SAID THAT YOU GOOGLE BOYFRIENDS 
I'M SURE THAT IS NOT THAT UNUSUAL 
I THINK IT IS THE JOURNALIST IN MAY 
A LOT OF MY FRIENDS DO IT L. THINK 
IT IS TOO EASY YOU HAVE ALL OF 
THESE SITES EVERYBODY IS ON 
FACEBOOK EVERYBODY THINKS WHO IS 
THE FRIENDS WITH LET'S SEE THE 
PICTURES 
DO YOU HAVE THE SAME PICTURES UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD 
COMMITMENT FOR WOMEN IT IS LOVE 
MARRIAGE HAPPY EVER AFTER FOR MEN 
IT MIGHT BE A MEANINGFUL ONE NIGHT 
STAND 
THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THE STAND INTERNET AND MODERN DAY LIFE IS 
THAT IT IS HARD TO HAVE ANY SECRETS 
BUT YOU CAN IF YOU ARE OF THAT 
MIND YOU CAN FABRICATE AN ENTIRE 
IDENTITY IF YOU WERE INTERESTED IN 
FOOLING PEOPLE AS TO WHO YOU WERE 
YOU SET YOURSELF UP AS A BOGUS 
PERSON 
IT IS RISKY HAVING DONE SO PERSON MANY REAL LIFE STORIES AT WORK 
PEOPLE ALWAYS GET FOUND OUT YOU 
JUST THINK IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO 
THIS ELABORATE HOAX ONE DAY IT IS 
GOING TO COME CRASHING DOWN 
IF A 
GUY SAYS HE HAS A RECORD COLLECTION 
MAKE SURE IT IS CLASSICAL AND NOT 
CRIMINAL 
LOVELY TO SPEAK TO YOU CRIMINAL BOTH BOTH LET'S TAKE YOU BACK TO OUR MAIN
