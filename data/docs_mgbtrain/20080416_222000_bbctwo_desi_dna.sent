I'M RAVINDER BHOGAL A COOKAHOLIC PASSIONATE ABOUT FOOD OR AS I LIKE TO PUT IT 
A FOOD PERVERT 
LIKE MOST PUNJABI GIRLS MY CULINARY TRAINING CAME FROM MY MOTHER 
WHO BELIEVED THE ONLY WAY TO CATCH A GOOD HUSBAND WAS BY LEARNING HOW TO COOK THE PERFECT CURRY 
WHO'S HUNGRY 
WELL THE HUSBAND IS YET TO BE REELED IN BUT I STILL ENJOY 
SHARING MY FAVOURITE RECIPES WITH FRIENDS FOR ME 
THE CURRY HAS BEEN PART AND PARCEL OF MY LIFE GROWING UP IN KENYA 
I HAD PLENTY BUT WHEN I MOVED HERE IN THE EIGHTIES 
LITTLE DID I REALISE WHAT A PHENOMENA IT WAS ABOUT TO BECOME 
TODAY THE BRITISH HAVE BECOME A NATION OF CURRYHOLICS 
WE'RE OBSESSED WITH IT EATING OVER SEVENTY MILLION EVERY YEAR 
SO HOW DID A COUNTRY KNOWN FOR ITS LOVE OF BLAND FOOD 
SUDDENLY BECOME ADDICTED TO SPICES 
I'LL BE TRAVELLING TO SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S CURRY HOTPOTS 
TO HEAR THE STORIES OF THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT THIS DISTINCT FLAVOUR TO BRITAIN 
THIS IS MY PERSONAL JOURNEY OF THE U. K. CURRY TRAIL 
AND MY QUEST TO DISCOVER HOW A SIMPLE DISH FROM SOUTH ASIA 
HAS MANAGED TO SEDUCE THE TASTE BUDS OF AN ENTIRE NATION 
THE LOCATION BRICK LANE IN EAST LONDON 
THE EVENT A FESTIVAL TO CELEBRATE AND SAMPLE SOME OF THE FINEST 
FLAVOURS IN PAKISTANI INDIAN BANGLADESHI CUISINE 
CHICKEN CURRY AND RICE VERY VERY NICE 
VEGETABLE CURRY AND RICE VERY VERY NICE 
THIS WEEK LONG ANNUAL FESTIVAL ATTRACTS OVER SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
THEY'RE LURED HERE BY ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY 
THEIR LOVE FOR THE CURRY 
WHETHER YOU'RE A KORMA QUEEN MADRAS MAD OR JUST HOT FOR THE VINDALOO 
THERE'S SOMETHING HERE TO TICKLE EVERYONE'S TASTE BUDS 
BUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS HUMBLE DISH A SIMPLE CONCOCTION OF GRAVY 
SPICES MEAT AND VEGETABLES WHICH HAS TURNED BRITAIN INTO A NATION OF CURRY ADDICTS 
CURRY IS FRAGRANT 
IT IS VERY ADDICTIVE DEFINITELY IT GIVES YOU A BIT OF A BUZZ 
SOCIAL 
THERE'S SO MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM IT'S FANTASTIC 
IT'S EXOTIC 
I THINK IT DATES BACK TO WHEN WE WERE IN INDIA AND 
IN THE RAJ AND WE ENJOYED ALL THE FOOD THERE SAME FOR THE TEA 
IT'S JUST CARRIED ALL THE WAY THROUGH ACTUALLY SHE'S RIGHT 
BRITAIN'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE CURRY GOES BACK AS FAR AS THE DAYS OF THE RAJ 
AS THE INFLUENCE OF THE BRITISH GREW IN INDIA 
SO TOO DID THE INTEREST IN INDIAN FOOD BACK IN BRITAIN 
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL NINETEEN TWENTY SIX THAT THE FIRST UPMARKET INDIAN RESTAURANT 
OPENED AND IT WAS RIGHT HERE IN THE HEART OF LONDON'S WEST END 
INDIAN COOKING HAS ALREADY LOST ITS UNDESERVED REPUTATION 
OF BEING THE EXCLUSIVE DIET OF EX ARMY OFFICERS 
FROM POONA AND ALL POINTS EAST 
AND YOU CERTAINLY DON'T NEED TO COME FROM THE EAST OF SUEZ 
TO KNOW THE KICK OF CURRIED CHICKEN AND PIQUANT CHUTNEYS' 
PEOPLE CAME HERE FOR CURRY BECAUSE THEY USED TO LIVE IN INDIA 
AND TAKE BREAKS HERE OR HAD GIVEN UP LIVING IN INDIA 
AND MISSED THE CURRY AND SO OF COURSE 
THE THRUST OF THE FOOD WAS THE CURRY 
SOON THE FASHIONABLE VEERASWAMY WAS ATTRACTING A WHOLE NEW CLIENTELE 
WE HAD INDIAN ROYALTY THE ACTING WORLD CLARK GABLE 
VIVIEN LEIGH THEY WERE ALL HERE SO IT WAS QUITE A PLACE 
WHAT WAS THE FOOD LIKE WHEN IT STARTED THE MENU WHEN IT OPENED WAS VERY INTERESTING 
IT HAD FOUR CURRIES BUT IT ALSO HAD 
SOUPS CONSOMMES IT HAD SNAIL 
IT HAD SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE 
IT HAD ALL THE CONTINENTAL EUROPEAN DISHES AS WELL 
DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF THE VEERASWAMY 
IT WAS AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR THAT THE CURRY BUG 
REALLY CAUGHT ON WITH THE MASSES 
THE FIFTY'S AND SIXTY'S SAW LABOUR STARVED BRITAIN 
WELCOME A NEW WAVE OF IMMIGRANTS FROM INDIAN AND PAKISTAN 
THESE MEN BROUGHT WITH THEM THEIR OWN STYLE OF COOKING 
MUCH TO THE ANNOYANCE OF THE SOME OF THE NEIGHBOURS 
THEY'RE NOT CLEAN 
AND THE SMELL OF THEIR COOKING MAKES YOU FEEL SICK 
YOU GET THE SMELL OF THEIR COOKING UPSTAIRS IN THE BEDROOM 
UNPERTURBED BY SUCH ATTITUDES 
MANY WENT ON TO SET UP THEIR OWN CAFES 
THESE WERE MORE LIKE MEETING HOUSES WHERE MEN 
REMINISCED ABOUT THEIR HOMELAND OVER SOME FAMILIAR FOOD 
AS LOCAL INTEREST IN THE FOOD GREW SO DID THE NUMBER OF CURRY CAFES 
BY THE SEVENTY'S THERE WERE OVER ONE THOUSAND INDIAN RESTAURANTS IN THE U. K. 
COME TO THE OVAL TANDOORI IN THE BRIXTON ROAD 
NEAR THE OVAL TUBE 
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT CURRY ON THE PLATE 
THE SAUCE AND BEING ABLE TO DIP THE BREAD AND ACTUALLY TASTING IT 
WHEN YOU PUT IT ON YOUR PALATE ALL THE TINGLING SPICES 
ARE GOING ALL OVER YOUR MOUTH IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THAT AND THE TRADITION OF ENGLISH COOKING 
WITH ITS MEAT AND TWO VEG SCENARIO 
FOR FOOD WRITER HUMAYAN HUSSAIN IT WASN'T UNTIL THE EIGHTIES THAT THE CURRY REALLY ARRIVED 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE B. B. C. AIRED BRITAIN'S FIRST EVER INDIAN COOKERY SERIES 
MILLIONS TUNED IN EVERY WEEK TO WATCH THE ORIGINAL SPICE GIRL MADHUR JAFFREY 
TODAY I'M GOING TO MAKE LEMONY CHICKEN WITH FRESH CORIANDER 
WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW WAYS TO COOK CHICKEN 
WELL THIS METHOD GIVES THE CHICKEN A VERY FRESH PUNGENT TASTE 
IT WAS A GROUND BREAKING SERIES 
THE FIRST TIME THE PUBLIC WAS ABLE TO SIT IN THEIR FRONT ROOM 
WATCH TELEVISION AND ACTUALLY REALISE WHAT INDIAN FOOD IS 
PUSH YOUR SLEEVES UP VERY IMPORTANT 
GET A PAIR OF TONGS A LONG PAIR OF SOLID TONGS LIKE THIS 
HOLD THE POPPADOM WITH THE TONGS AND LAY IT OVER THE FLAME 
I THINK IT BROKE DOWN A LOT OF BARRIERS 
AND MADE INDIAN FOOD THE WAY IT IS TODAY 
I THINK IT WAS GREAT IN ACTUALLY SETTING THE SCENE 
FOR INDIAN RESTAURANTS BUT NOT JUST RESTAURANTS THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE EIGHTIES 
WHICH IS TO DO WITH NEW INGREDIENTS BEING AVAILABLE IN SUPERMARKETS 
PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY BUY THOSE AND COOK AT HOME 
AND WHAT HAS THE CURRY DONE FOR COMMUNITIES IN BRITAIN 
I THINK IT'S DONE A LOT BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS SAY 
FOOD IS PART AND PARCEL OF A COMMUNITY'S CULTURE 
SO WHILST CURRY ESTABLISHED ITSELF AND BECAME SYNONYMOUS 
I THINK WHAT IT'S ALSO DONE IS IT'S MADE SOCIETIES SHALL WE SAY 
TRY AND UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT MORE 
WHERE CULTURES HAVE COME TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE THE ENGLISH COMMUNITY THE HOST COMMUNITY 
HAS STARTED TO UNDERSTAND A BIT MORE ABOUT THE INDIAN COMMUNITY THE ASIAN CULTURE THROUGH FOOD 
SO I THINK IT'S HAD NOTHING BUT A POSITIVE EFFECT 
TODAY THERE ARE OVER NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CURRY HOUSES THROUGHOUT THE U. K. 
LONDON ALONE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE MORE THAN INDIA 
THE CURRY LIKE ALL OTHER CUISINE IS CONSTANTLY EVOLVING TO SUIT DIFFERENT PALATES 
BUT THANKFULLY SOME DISHES REMAIN THE SAME 
WHICHEVER SIDE OF THE WORLD YOU'RE IN 
THESE ARE JALEBIS THEY'RE THE MOST DELICIOUS INDIAN SWEET 
AND HERE THEY'RE DONE JUST AS THEY ARE IN ANY STREET IN BOMBAY 
BASICALLY IT'S A SUGAR AND FLOUR BATTER 
THE CHEF PIPES THEM INTO REALLY REALLY HOT OIL 
THEY CRISP UP AND THEY GO REALLY REALLY GOLDEN AND LOVELY 
THEY'RE DIPPED INTO THE SUGAR SYRUP BRIEFLY 
REALLY REALLY DELICIOUS GLISTENING WITH THAT SUGAR SYRUP 
IT'S TEMPTING ME TO HAVE A TRY 
I'M JUST GOING TO TASTE ONE CAN I TASTE ONE 
THANK YOU SO MUCH 
WAIT FOR IT 
THIS IS SOUTHALL IN WEST LONDON 
HOME TO THE LARGEST PUNJABI SIKH COMMUNITY OUTSIDE OF INDIA 
MANY OF THE EARLY SETTLERS CAME HERE IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
TO WORK IN WOOLF'S RUBBER FACTORY AWAY FROM THEIR WIVES AND FAMILY 
THEIR ONLY SOLACE WAS FOOD THE TASTE OF HOME AWAY FROM HOME 
AS THE COMMUNITY GREW SO TOO DID ITS RESTAURANT SCENE 
TODAY THE AREA IS AFFECTIONATELY CALLED LITTLE INDIA 
AS A PUNJABI MYSELF THIS PLACE HOLDS FOND MEMORIES' 
I USED TO COME HERE ALL THE TIME WHEN I WAS A CHILD 
THIS IS WHERE MY PARENTS DID THE BULK OF THEIR FOOD SHOPPING 
IN THOSE DAYS IT WASN'T SO EASY TO GET HOLD OF SPICES AND EXOTIC FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AS IT IS NOW 
WHILE MY SISTERS WOULD RUN OFF TO BUY BOLLYWOOD CASSETTES AND MAGAZINES 
I'D BE DRAWN HERE TO THESE BEAUTIFUL VEGETABLE SHOPS 
IT WAS SO INSPIRING FOR ME TO COME HERE AND BE ABLE TO TOUCH THINGS 
SO FREELY AND TASTE THINGS IT'S WHAT INSPIRED ME IN MY COOKERY 
THESE FAMILY TRIPS WOULD ALWAYS END WITH SOME SNACKS 
IN ONE OF THE LOCAL RESTAURANTS 
OR MY MOTHER MAKING US SOME LOVELY PUNJABI FOOD WHEN WE GOT BACK HOME 
I'M MAKING CHANNA BHATURA WHICH IS ONE OF MOTHER'S FAMOUS RECIPES 
IT'S A VERY TRADITIONAL PUNJABI DISH 
IT'S TYPICAL OF MOST PUNJABI FOOD IN THAT IT'S VERY NOURISHING 
IN PUNJAB IT'S MAINLY FARMING LAND SO THE MEN WOULD WORK ON THE LAND 
AND THEY NEEDED TO EAT THINGS THAT KEPT THEM FULL 
FOR VERY LONG REALLY HEARTY FOOD 
QUITE SIMPLE FOOD AND THIS DISH JUST SUMS IT UP 
LOVELY 
STIR THEM IN 
I'M MAKING THE BHATURA TO GO WITH MY CHANNA 
PUNJABIS TRADITIONALLY EAT CURRIES WITH BREADS SUCH AS NAAN CHAPATTIS AND PARATHA 
THIS ONE IS DEEP FRIED WHICH MAKES IT CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE AND WONDERFULLY DOUGHY INSIDE 
MY HOT CHANNA 
SERVED WITH HOT BHATURA 
ALTHOUGH YOU'LL FIND PUNJABI OR NORTH INDIAN DISHES 
LIKE NAANS DAALS AND TANDOORIS IN MOST CURRY HOUSES 
OVER SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF SO CALLED INDIAN RESTAURANTS IN THE COUNTRY 
ARE IN FACT BANGLADESHI OWNED 
THIS TREND DATES BACK TO POST NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE WHEN EAST PAKISTAN BECAME BANGLADESH 
THOUSANDS FLED THEIR HOMELAND AND SOUGHT REFUGE IN THE U. K. 
UNEMPLOYED AND WITH LIMITED SKILLS 
THEY TURNED TO WHAT CAME NATURALLY COOKING 
TRADITIONAL BANGLADESHI CUISINE IS ALL ABOUT FISH AND RICE 
BEING A COASTAL REGION BOTH ARE IN ABUNDANCE 
TO QUOTE A POPULAR SAYING MACCHE BAATEIN BENGALI 
FISH AND RICE MAKE A BENGALI 
TO FIND OUT MORE I TRAVELLED BACK TO THE EAST END OF LONDON 
HOME TO A QUARTER OF THE BANGLADESHI COMMUNITY IN BRITAIN 
AND ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS CURRY HOTPOTS IN THE COUNTRY BRICK LANE 
DRIVEN BY CITY EXPANSION BRICK LANE TODAY IS A MELTING POT 
OF CHEAP AND CHEERFUL FOOD TRENDY BARS AND A THRIVING FASHION AND ARTS SCENE 
THIS WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE 
IT WAS ALL DERELICT IF YOU CAN IMAGINE ER 
THIRTY YEARS AGO THOSE BUILDING YOU SEE WEREN'T THERE AT ALL 
IF YOU TOLD ANYBODY THAT YOU HAVE GOT A BUSINESS OR LIVE IN BRICK LANE THEY WOULD LOOK DOWN ON YOU 
SO THEREFORE IT WAS A NO GO AREA 
RESTAURANT OWNER MUQUIM AHMED CAME TO BRITAIN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AGED NINETEEN 
BY THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX HE'D BECOME BRITAIN'S FIRST BANGLADESHI MILLIONAIRE 
HIS EARLY YEARS WERE SPENT LIVING ABOVE THE NAZ CINEMA IN THE HEART OF THE STREET 
TODAY IT'S BEEN CONVERTED INTO PART OF A CHAIN OF RESTAURANTS 
BRICK LANE AT THE END WAS REALLY A NO GO AREA 
BECAUSE WE USED TO FIGHT TO GO REALLY WHY IS THAT 
BECAUSE OF NATIONAL FRONT THERE WAS A BIG FIGHT 
BETWEEN THE NATIONAL FRONT AND US 
SOME NATIONALIST SKINHEAD BOYS 
CAME TO THE END OF BRICK LANE FRIGHTENING TIMES YEAH 
AND THEY WERE BREAKING WINDOWS SHOP FRONTS BUT WE STOOD UP 
THE EAST END HAS TRADITIONALLY ALWAYS BEEN A HOME 
FOR THE MIGRANT WORKERS FROM THE HUGUENOTS TO THE JEWISH 
AND NOW THE BANGLADESHIS 
MR. LEO IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE LAST PERSONS FROM THE JEWISH COMMUNITY 
TO ER BE IN BRICK LANE COS MOST OF THEM HAVE GONE 
EVERY ONE OF THEM WAS JEWISH COMMUNITY JEWISH TRADERS HERE 
BUT HE I THINK AND HIS FAMILY IS STILL HERE 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN AMAZING FOR YOU TO SEE ALL THE CHANGES 
WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE 
PEOPLE CAME TO THIS AREA PARTICULARLY EAST LONDON 
BECAUSE IT WAS THE NEAREST FROM THEY TOOK THE BOAT 
WHICH VERY OFTEN STOPPED UNDER THE TOWER BRIDGE 
GOT OFF COULDN'T AFFORD TAXIS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
THEY HAD THEIR PARCELS AND WALKED TO THE NEAREST AREA WHICH IS THE EAST END 
THEY INVARIABLY ENDED UP IN BRICK LANE COS IT WAS THE CHEAPEST AREA 
PEOPLE FROM THOSE DAYS WOULDN'T BELIEVE THAT TODAY 
BRICK LANE'S BECOME TRENDY WHEN THEY COULDN'T WAIT TO GET OUT OF THE PLACE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THE CURRY'S DONE FOR THE COMMUNITY HERE I THINK THAT CURRY HAS 
MADE A LOT OF CHANGE IN OUR COMMUNITY 
NINETY NINE PER CENT OF OUR COMMUNITY ARE INVOLVED IN THE RESTAURANT TRADE 
WE DERIVE OUR WEALTH FROM THE CURRY 
AND WE PROVIDE A SERVICE TO THE LONDONERS 
BY PROVIDING THEM FOOD CURRIES IN THE EVENING 
AND IT IS IN THE EVENING THAT BRICK LANE REALLY COMES TO LIFE 
THE BRIGHT NEON LIGHTS BECKON AS DO THE CURRY TOUTS 
WHO STAND OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANTS READY TO ENTICE ANY POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS 
ONCE AN IMMIGRANTS' COLONY THE BRITS' LOVE FOR CURRY 
AND THE TOIL OF THE EARLY BANGLADESHI SETTLERS 
HAS TODAY TRANSFORMED THIS HISTORICAL STREET 
INTO THE ULTIMATE FOOD DESTINATION 
WITH JUST UNDER HALF OF THE U. K.'S CURRY HOUSES BASED IN LONDON 
AND THE SOUTH THE CHOICE FOR CURRY LOVERS IN ENDLESS 
BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE TRENDS ARE FURTHER UP NORTH 
MY FIRST STOP IS BIRMINGHAM IN THE WEST MIDLANDS 
PAKISTANIS FROM KASHMIR MAKE UP THE LARGEST ETHNIC COMMUNITY HERE 
THE FIRST GENERATION OF MIGRANTS CAME IN THE FIFTIES 
TO WORK IN THE CITY'S THRIVING MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY 
ITS STEADY DECLINE MEANT WIDESPREAD UNEMPLOYMENT BUT EVENTUALLY 
LED TO THE BIRTH OF THIS CITY'S CURRY HOTSPOT THE BALTI TRIANGLE 
RENOWN FOR THE BALTI WHICH LITERALLY TRANSLATED MEANS THE BUCKET 
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO BIRMINGHAM BEFORE 
AND HERE I AM IN THE HEART OF BIRMINGHAM'S BALTI TRIANGLE 
I'VE BEEN LURED HERE BY THE LEGEND OF THE BALTI 
AND I'M HERE TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU GET IN YOUR BUCKET 
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU GET IN YOUR BUCKET 
BUT HOW YOU COOK IT AND THAT'S WITH ALL THE INGREDIENTS COMING TOGETHER 
IN A WOK OR A KARAHI COOKED ON A HIGH HEAT AND THEN SERVED 
IN THE SAME DISH TO RETAIN FRESHNESS AND HEAT 
SUCH IS ITS POPULARITY THAT THE ROUGH GUIDE PLACES IT 
HIGH ON ITS LIST OF ULTIMATE EXPERIENCES 
AND NOW THERE ARE EVEN BALTI TOURS TO EXPLAIN ITS ORIGINS 
BALTI IS A STYLE OF COOKING O. K. 
IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED INTO THIS AREA ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY 
AND EVERY BALTI HOUSE SAYS THEY'RE THE FIRST BALTI HOUSE OF COURSE 
IT'S LIKE THE SECRET OF THE HOLY GRAIL THOUGH LOT OF CONTENTION ABOUT THAT IN THE COMMUNITY 
NOW IN ITS THIRD YEAR THE TOUR ATTRACTS PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
ANDY MUNRO A SELF CONFESSED BALTIHOLIC ISN'T SURPRISED 
YEARS AGO YOU'D GO TO A PLACE WITH WALLPAPER LATE AT NIGHT 
AND IT WOULD BE A KNIFE AND FORK WITH RICE WHEN I HAD A BALTI FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IT WAS THE INFORMALITY OF THE WHOLE THING THE FRESHNESS OF IT 
THAT REALLY GOT TO ME IT WAS JUST A GREAT EXPERIENCE 
SO TELL ME WHAT IS THE BALTI WHERE DOES IT STEM FROM 
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF STORIES ABOUT THE BALTI THERE'S A PLACE CALLED BALTISTAN IN PAKISTAN 
SOME TRIBAL PEOPLE CALLED THE BALTIS WHO APPARENTLY SPEAK BALTI WOW 
IT'S LIKE SAYING JAM COMES FROM JAMAICA TO ME THE WORD BALTI 
WAS SOMETHING THOUGHT UP BY SOMEBODY IT MEANS BUCKET DOESN'T IT 
LITERALLY TRANSLATED IT MEANS BUCKET YEAH 
IT'S BASICALLY THAT AS I SAY HAS BEEN MADE IN BIRMINGHAM 
I THINK IT'S ONE OF BIRMINGHAM'S REAL UNIQUE SELLING POINTS 
BECAUSE IT'S A BRUMMY THING A BRUMMY DISH 
SO IF I WAS TO GO AND HAVE A BALTI IN LONDON 
YOU'D SAY IT'S NOT A VERY AUTHENTIC ONE ABSOLUTELY NOT 
THEY MIGHT CALL IT BALTI THEY MIGHT HAVE JUMPED ON THE BALTI WAGON 
THE FOUR HOUR TOUR CULMINATES IN A COOK OFF WHERE A TWO PEOPLE 
ARE PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER TO RUSTLE UP A BRUMMY BALTI 
NOT ONE TO SHY AWAY FROM ANY CHALLENGE 
I NATURALLY TAKE UP THE OFFER 
AFTER ALL I CAN'T COME ALL THIS WAY AND NOT HAVE A GO 
MAY THE BEST MAN OR WOMAN WIN 
TOMATOES NEXT WHAT'S NEXT MATE 
THAT'S ENOUGH RIGHT O. K. 
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME COOKING A BALTI 
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT DIFFICULT JUST COOK ON A HIGH HEAT 
ADD ALL THE INGREDIENTS AND THEN WE'RE OFF 
ADD THE GARAM MASALA AND THE MIXED MASALA 
AND THE FRESH CORIANDER BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A KNACK TO IT 
OH O. K. I'M ON FIRE FIRE 
WOW 
SO MINE'S DONE 
SO LET'S SEE LET'S SEE WHO WINS IT 
LET'S HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A TASTE HERE O. K. 
NOW THAT'S QUITE DIFFERENT I THOUGHT THAT WAS GONNA BE DRY BUT IT'S NOT 
BUT I HAVE TO SAY REGRETFULLY 
WELL DONE 
O. K. I DIDN'T SAY I WAS PERFECT AT EVERYTHING 
BUT JUST TRY TAKING ME ON WITH PUNJABI COOKING 
TRADITIONALLY BALTI HOUSES HERE IN THE TRIANGLE 
HAD SIMPLE INTERIORS AND MENUS DISPLAYED UNDER GLASS TOPPED TABLES BUT MORE OF THEM MODERNISING 
IS THERE A DANGER THAT THE ESSENCE OF THE BALTI EXPERIENCE WILL ONE DAY BE LOST 
BALTIS ARE ALWAYS GONNA BE AROUND IN SOME FORM OR OTHER 
THE RESTAURANTS HAVE BECOME MORE UPMARKET LOSING THE DESKTOP TABLES 
BUT WHAT THE ACTUAL BALTI HOUSES REALLY STOOD FOR 
BUT THE ACTUAL BALTI ITSELF I DO BELIEVE WILL BE AROUND FOR YEARS 
I HOPE SO THIS ONE SIMPLE DISH COOKED AND SERVED IN A KARAHI 
HAS BROUGHT SO MUCH FOCUS TO BIRMINGHAM AND ITS PAKISTANI COMMUNITY 
THAT IT REALLY SHOULD BE RESPECTED AND CELEBRATED 
I FOR ONE CAN NOW TICK IT OFF MY MUST DO LIST MM REALLY GOOD 
I THE SECOND IIIIIIIILIIIL THE THIRD IIIILII IT 
A NEW DAY AND A NEW CITY 
THIS TIME I'M TRAVELLING EAST OF BIRMINGHAM TO LEICESTER 
TWINNED WITH THE GUJARATI CITY OF RAJKOT IN INDIA 
LEICESTER'S FAMOUS FOR HOLDING THE BIGGEST DIWALI CELEBRATION OUTSIDE OF ASIA 
THIS YEARLY HINDU FESTIVAL OF LIGHT ALONE ATTRACTS OVER THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
GUJARATIS FROM EAST AFRICA MAKE UP A LARGE PART OF THE ASIAN COMMUNITY HERE 
MOST CAME IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO WHEN IDI AMIN EXPELLED SIXTY THOUSAND ASIANS OUT OF UGANDA 
MANY LEFT PENNILESS AND HOMELESS HAVING BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE MOST OF THEIR POSSESSIONS BEHIND 
THE ASIANS ARRIVED IN COLD WET WEATHER AT STANSTED 
MANY OF THEM LACKED RAINWEAR YET MOST SEEMED CHEERFUL AND PLEASED TO BE IN ENGLAND 
WHOLE FAMILIES HAVE ARRIVED WITH LITTLE CASH 
THIRTY FIVE YEARS ON AND THE COMMUNITY HAVE MADE THIS CITY THEIR HOME 
AND A MECCA FOR GUJARATI CUISINE 
THE MAJORITY OF RESTAURANTS ARE BASED IN BELGRAVE ROAD 
ALSO KNOWN AS THE GOLDEN MILE MM I WONDER WHY 
GUJARATI CUISINE IS PREDOMINANTLY VEGETARIAN 
DELICATELY FLAVOURED WITH LIGHT TEXTURED DISHES THAT HAVE BEEN BAKED OR STEAMED 
THIS IS DHOKRA JUST ONE OF ITS VERY POPULAR SNACKS 
COMING FROM KENYA WHICH ALSO HAS A SIZEABLE GUJARATI COMMUNITY 
I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE CUISINES SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO LUNCH 
WHICH I'M HAVING WITH THE FAMILY BEHIND ONE OF LEICESTER'S FIRST VEGETARIAN RESTAURANTS BOBBY'S 
HI HELLO HI RAVINDER HOW ARE YOU LOVELY TO MEET YOU 
AND YOU I'M DHARMESH THAT'S MY SISTER MALA 
LOVELY TO MEET YOU HOW ARE YOU I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WAITED FOR ME 
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE THAT'S O. K. I WOULD'VE TUCKED IN IF IT WAS ME NO WE COULDN'T 
WE'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO SOME OF THE FAMILY HERE THIS IS MY FATHER HELLO HOW LOVELY TO MEET YOU 
BHAGVANJI LAKHANI AND HIS LATE WIFE MANGLA STARTED THE FAMILY RUN BUSINESS THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO 
MY BROTHER HERE ATUL AND A BABY THIS IS THE BABY 
I'VE GOT MALA SURBI NISHA MY BROTHER IN LAW PRADIP 
MY NIECES AARTI AND MEERA MY WIFE IN BETWEEN THERE I MIGHT FORGET A FEW NAMES 
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THEM ALL NOW YOU'VE COME TO LUNCH WITH US 
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S ON THE TABLE 
WELL THERE IS MOST OF THEM ARE TYPICAL GUJARATI DISHES 
THAT'S KACHORI THAT'S LENTIL BALLS 
THEN WE'VE GOT DHOKRA MADE OF GRAM FLOUR 
THEN WE'VE GOT UNDHVO TYPICAL GUJARATI DISH 
THAT IS VERY TYPICAL GUJARATI 
AND IT'S A BAKED DISH WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN KENYA 
WE HAD A GUJARATI FAMILY WHO LIVED ACROSS THE ROAD 
AND WE USED TO LOVE GOING OVER THERE JUST COS I FOUND THE FOOD SO EXOTIC 
IT WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM PUNJABI FOOD AND THEN EVENTUALLY MY MOTHER 
TO KEEP US AT HOME LEARNT HOW TO COOK GUJARATI FOOD 
IT'S SNACKY IT'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL CURRIES AND THINGS 
IT'S NOT HEAVILY SPICED WHEN THEY THOUGHT OF INDIAN FOOD 
THEY THINK OF BENGALI RESTAURANTS OR TANDOORI RESTAURANTS 
BUT THERE'S AN ELEMENT A BIG PART OF INDIA WHICH IS GUJARAT 
AND YOU KNOW THE TYPE OF FOOD AND PEOPLE WHO ORIGINATE FROM THERE 
YEAH 
AND LEICESTER IS A FOCAL POINT 
THE LAKHANIS CAME TO LEICESTER AFTER FLEEING UGANDA IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO 
THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS WAS SOMETHING THEY FELL INTO BY ACCIDENT 
NONE OF YOU WERE IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS SO WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA 
OF SETTING UP A RESTAURANT MY DAD 
HE CAME HOME AND TOLD US AND WE ALL KIND OF LAUGHED AT HIM 
THE FUNNIEST THING WAS HE SAID TO MY MUM WE'RE OPENING A RESTAURANT SHE SAID WHO'S COOKING 
HE LOOKED AT HER AND SAID YOU ARE 
WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HERE IT MUST'VE BEEN DIFFERENT 
THIS WAS A DEAD AREA COMPLETELY WHEN WE CAME IN THIS COUNTRY 
EVERYTHING BUILT BY ANCIENTS YOU KNOW 
THE PEOPLE OF LEICESTER I DON'T THINK THEY INITIALLY WANTED THE ASIANS TO COME OVER 
WAS THAT QUITE A STRUGGLE THEN 
YES IT WAS SETTLING IN AND INTEGRATING 
IT WAS A STRUGGLE THEY WERE JUST SCARED BECAUSE 
THEY ACTUALLY PUT AN ADVERT IN A UGANDAN NEWSPAPER 
SAYING THAT PLEASE DON'T ALL COME TO LEICESTER 
REALLY YES THEY ACTUALLY PUT AN ADVERT 
I THINK THAT'S WHY WE ALL CAME OVER TO LEICESTER 
FOR ME THE LAKHANIS REALLY EXEMPLIFY THE COURAGE AND RESILIENCE OF THE UGANDAN GUJARATIS 
TO GIVE UP THEIR POSSESSIONS AND SUCCESSFULLY REBUILD THEIR LIVES IN A FOREIGN LAND 
REALLY IS A TESTAMENT TO ALL THEIR HARD WORK 
NOT SURPRISINGLY THE GUJARATIS ARE NOW ONE OF THE MOST PROSPEROUS SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITIES IN BRITAIN 
I'VE COME TO THE END OF MY VISIT TO LEICESTER BUT I COULDN'T LEAVE 
WITHOUT CHECKING OUT A VENUE WHICH PROMOTES THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT 
OF ANY DECENT DISH ASIAN SPICES 
SPICES ARE THE HEART AND SOUL OF A GOOD CURRY 
IT'S WHAT CREATES THE UNIQUE BLEND OF FLAVOURS 
AND WHAT MAKES AN ASIAN KHEEMA OR MINCE CURRY DIFFERENT FROM THE MEXICAN CHILLI 
KAYCEE PATEL HAS DEVOTED HIS RESTAURANT TO PROMOTING THE FLAVOURS 
AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF THESE SPICES 
HERE WHOLE SPICES ARE ON DISPLAY AND IF ANY TAKE YOUR FANCY 
YOU CAN JUST BUY THEM FROM THE RANGE ON SALE 
IN TRADITIONAL AYURVEDIC TERMS SPICES PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT PART IN INDIAN CUISINE YEAH 
ER AND THE TRADITIONAL CHEF 
HE WOULD'VE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THE BODY TYPE 
THE SORT OF MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF SPICES 
AND THE BALANCING OF TASTE 
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE BEGINNING TO DEMYSTIFY THE SPICES 
BECAUSE PEOPLE SEE ALL THESE SPICES AND THEY'RE FRIGHTENED AREN'T THEY 
I THINK THE REASON FOR PEOPLE BEING FRIGHTENED BY SPICES IS BECAUSE 
THEY'VE REALLY NOT NURTURED IT AND GOT CLOSE TO THEM 
PEOPLE JUST BUY THE SPICES JUST BECAUSE THEY FOLLOW THE INGREDIENTS 
AND NOT REALLY TAKE TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE SPICES 
YOU KNOW IN THE OLD DAYS SPICES WERE AS EXPENSIVE AS GOLD 
YOU'D HAVE PAID A LOT MORE ATTENTION TO THAT PRODUCT 
AND IF ANY OF THE SPICES BAFFLE YOU KAYCEE'S ON HAND TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE 
FIRST HAVE A FEEL AND SMELL WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IT SMELLS VERY FLORAL MM HMM 
REALLY REALLY FLORAL AND ALMOST A BIT 
IT FEELS LIKE A BIT LIKE DRIED THYME 
IT'S ACTUALLY FROM THE SAME FAMILY AS THE SEAWEED FAMILY 
IT'S CALLED DHANIA FLOWERS AND 
WE USE THESE IN GARAM MASALA I WOULD NEVER HAVE 
I'D NEVER HAVE ASSOCIATED SEAWEED WITH INDIAN FOOD 
IT'S MORE A JAPANESE THING FOR ME EXACTLY ERM 
BUT YOU USE IT EVEN IN THE TRADITIONAL DAAL THEY USE THIS SPICE 
THERE'S SUCH BEAUTIFUL VISUAL SPICES LIKE THIS BEAUTIFUL CURL OF CASSIA BARK 
IT'S THE SAME FAMILY AS CINNAMON BUT THE INDIANS TEND TO USE CASSIA 
FAR MORE THAN CINNAMON IS IT THE SAME FLAVOUR YES BUT THE CINNAMON'S MORE INTENSE 
TELL US ABOUT THE SPICE TOURS WHO COMES ON THESE TOURS 
ESSENTIALLY WE GET PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE 
THE YOUNG OLD ENGLISH INDIAN 
BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME WE GET WOMEN COMING DOWN 
BECAUSE THE IDEA IS TO TOTALLY DEMYSTIFY AND EXPLAIN TO THEM 
THAT IF YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT SPICES IN YOUR PAN AND CUPBOARD 
YOU CAN EASILY MAKE A MEAL WITHIN TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES 
INDIAN COOKING IS COOKING WITH YOUR HEART RATHER THAN MEASUREMENTS 
THE IDEA IS TO EXPLORE AND HAVE FUN AND GO WITH YOUR SENSES 
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU'VE GOTTA UNDERSTAND SPICES 
IN A SIMILAR WAY AS YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND WINE 
YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THE FLAVOURS THE COMPLEXITY 
THE TASTE BEHIND YOU'VE GOT TO RESPECT THE SPICES 
TO MAKE YOUR SPICES WORK FOR YOU I'VE LEARN THAT 
I'M NOW HALFWAY THROUGH MY VERY OWN CURRY TRAIL OF THE U. K. 
ALTHOUGH I'M NO STRANGER TO THE CUISINE 
WHAT'S BEEN FASCINATING IS SEEING AND TASTING HOW THE FOOD VARIES FROM REGION TO REGION 
A BIT LIKE A SUBCONTINENT REALLY 
FROM THE PUNJABI FLAVOURS OF SOUTHALL TO THE BENGALI CUISINE OF BRICK LANE 
WHAT YOU GET IN LEICESTER WITH ITS DISTINCT GUJARATI INFLUENCE 
IT'S SO DIFFERENT TO THE KASHMIRI INSPIRED BALTI IN BIRMINGHAM 
NEXT WEEK I TRAVEL UP NORTH TO MANCHESTER'S CURRY MILE 
MEET A BUDDING ENTREPRENEUR IN BRADFORD 
WHEN I FIRST TOLD MY FATHER I WANT TO GET BACK IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS 
HE TOLD ME TO GET A JOB AND MAKE SURE IT'S WITH A BANK 
TRY THE WORLD'S HOTTEST CURRY IN NEWCASTLE 
AND HIT THE STREETS OF GLASGOW TO UNCOVER THE MYSTERY OF THE CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA 
WHERE DO YOU THINK THE CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA COMES FROM 
ER CHICKENS
