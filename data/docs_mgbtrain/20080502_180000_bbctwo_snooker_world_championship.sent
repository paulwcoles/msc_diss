HE NEEDS FIVE MORE FRAMES AND 
PROUD SEVEN TIMES CHAMPION STEPHEN 
HENDRY CAN HE SUMMON ALL HIS 
POWERS OF RESISTANCE WE ARE ABOUT 
TO FIND OUT 
IN THE 
COMPANY OF CLIVE 
EVERTON AND JOHN VIRGO 
GOOD EVENING STEPHEN HENDRY'S 
FIRST TASK IS TO AVOID LOSING 
IF A O'SULLIVAN LOSES THIS SESSION 
FIVE TO THREE TOMORROW'S FINAL SESSION WILL 
TAKE PLACE 
HINDLEY FACING THE MOTHER OF ALL 
UPHILL BATTLES HENDRY HE HAS 
ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS A CONTENDER 
AT THE CRUCIBLE AGAIN AFTER A LEAN 
PATCH STEPHEN HENDRY WITH AN EIGHTY SEVEN PER CENT 
POT SUCCESS RATE O'SULLIVAN NINETY FOUR PER CENT 
ONLY SEVENTY EIGHT PER CENT OF HENDRY'S SAFETY SHORTS 
ARE PREVENTED O'SULLIVAN POTTING A 
BALL IN THE NEXT SHOT 
THE STATISTICS DO NOT DO JUSTICE TO 
THE QUALITY OF O'SULLIVAN'S 
PERFORMANCE THIS MORNING 
AT HIS BEST O'SULLIVAN IS THE BEST 
THERE HAS EVER BEEN 
IT IS IN FACT FOR IDEAS SINCE IN 
VERY BEAT O'SULLIVAN FIVE EARS 
BASHED IDEAS SINCE HENDRY BEAT 
O'SULLIVAN FIVE YEARS 
THAT HAS OPENED IT UP BUT STEPHEN 
MISSED JUDGED IT IF HE CANNOT 
THROUGH TO 
A RED TO 
THE RIGHT 
CORNER HE 
HAS 
BEEN A 
LITTLE BIT 
FORTUNATE STEPHEN 
WILL NEED 
OF 
LUCK IF HE 
IS TO 
GET OUT 
OF THIS WHOLE HE 
IS IN THE 
RED WAS 
ONE THAT IS 
WHY 
HE DID 
NOT PLAY 
FOR THE 
COLOUR JUST A ROLL UP 
FOR THE COLOUR JUST A ROLL UP SNOOKER 
WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED HAD HE MISSED 
IT BUT HAVING POTTED IT HE HAS 
LEFT HENDRY THERE 
THIS IS THE 
DANGEROUS SIDE TO COME DOWN HE HAS 
JUDGED IT PRETTY WELL THREE REDS 
THAT WERE POTTABLE IF HE JUST SLIDE 
PAST 
THERE MAY 
BE A RED 
PAST THERE MAY BE A RED THAT RONNIE 
WHAT 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
HAS GOT 
TO 
IS HAVE AN ERROR FOR THE EVENING 
THERE ARE ERROR FREE IS A 
MISTAKE FROM RONNIE CHANCE NOW FOR 
STEPHEN 
IF HE IS REFUSING IT HE MUST MAKE 
CERTAIN HE 
DOES NOT 
LEAVE THAT RED 
FOR RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AND HE HAS 
SOME YEARS AGO HENDRY WOULD NOT 
HAVE TURNED THAT RED DOWN 
I DO NOT 
UNDERSTAND WHY HE TURNED IT 
THEN THERE WAS ALWAYS 
THE RISK OF 
LEAVING THIS RED 
IT LOOKED 
AS IF STEPHEN COULD 
HAVE PLAYED 
IT 
AS A SHOT TO NOTHING HE 
HAS GOT 
PLAY 
ERROR FREE SO PERHAPS 
HE IS 
PLAY ERROR FREE SO PERHAPS HE IS BEARING ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION 
ERRING HE WILL HAVE TO PLAY BETTER 
SAFETY SHOTS THAN THAT 
THERE ARE LOOSE REDS BUT O'SULLIVAN 
IS A MASTER OF OPENING THE BUNCH 
WITHOUT LOSING POSITION 
IF HE'S STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK HE 
IS ASSESSING HIS POSITIONAL OPTIONS 
FROM THAT BALL 
HE CANNOT GET THROUGH TO THE PINK 
THIS 
IS NOT 
STRAIGHTFORWARD IF HE 
THIS IS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD IF HE PLAYS 
THE SCREW BACK HE 
COLLIDE WITH 
THE RED NEAR THE 
HAND CUSHION THAT WILL NOT HELP COULD PLAY FOR THE PINK LUCKY TO 
HAVE IT 
AS A SECOND OPTION STILL ONE RED AT THE 
BOTTOM OF THE 
CLUSTER TO PLAY FOR 
USUALLY IN THOSE SITUATIONS BODY 
LEAVES HIMSELF A LITTLE 
LOW SO HE 
CAN BRING THE 
OTHER REDS INTO 
PLAY 
AND THAT IS THE CASE HERE 
HE MADE CERTAIN HE WAS BACK IN THE 
MIDDLE 
OF THE 
TABLE 
WITH THAT CUE 
BALL 
HE ONLY 
BROUGHT ONE RED INTO 
PLAY 
STEPHEN HENDRY KNOWS THIS FRAME IS 
OVER FOR HIM THAT IS IF RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN CAN GET THE BUNCH OPEN 
WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT NOTHING LESS 
HE HIT THAT PERFECT RED TO SPLIT 
THEM OPEN ANOTHER FRAME IN THE BAG 
O'SULLIVAN HAS PICKED UP WHERE HE 
LEFT OFF AT LUNCHTIME AN EXHIBITION OF SUPREME SKILL 
CAN HE MAKE HIS TENTH CENTURY OF 
THIS CHAMPIONSHIP 
LEFT HIMSELF 
NICELY ON THE 
BLUE TO 
COME OFF THE 
TOP CUSHION JUST NUDGED THE RED 
UNLUCKY 
LOOKS AS IF IT IS AUTOMATIC HE'S HE'S SO GOOD IT'S FRIGHTENING 
O'SULLIVAN CERTAINLY DOING HIS BIT 
TOWARDS SETTING NEW RECORD OF 
TOTAL CENTURIES FOR THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP THIS IS THE FIFTY AND 
REBECCA DOES SIXTY EIGHT THIS IS FIFTY EIGHTH AND THE RECORD IS SIXTY EIGHT 
O'SULLIVAN'S THERE TOTAL CLEARANCE 
OF THE DAY YOU 
CANNOT ARGUE 
WITH 
OF THE DAY YOU CANNOT ARGUE WITH PERFECTION THAT IS TWELVE FRAMES 
SUCCESSION FROM O'SULLIVAN HE 
LEADS 
WE'RE GETTING INTO RECORD BREAKING 
TERRITORY 
THE MOST 
FRAMES 
TERRITORY THE MOST FRAMES ONE WAS BY 
MARK WILLIAMS AGAINST QUINTEN 
BY MARK WILLIAMS AGAINST QUINTEN HANN 
A FEW YEARS AGO THIS 
UNBELIEVABLY 
GOOD HOW WOULD YOU 
SUM THIS 
UP TO 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
NEVER 
PLAYED SNOOKER 
CLIVE 
SUMMED IT 
UP HE SAID 
YOU CANNOT 
ARGUE 
WITH GENIUS HE HAS LEFT 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
HAS LITERALLY 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS LITERALLY NOT HAD 
A SHOT 
FOR A 
PROUD CHAMPION 
LIKE STEPHEN 
HENDRY 
HOW HUMBLING 
LIKE STEPHEN HENDRY HOW HUMBLING AND PAINFUL 
EXPERIENCE IS THIS 
HE 
HAS DONE IT 
SO MANY 
TIMES TWO OTHER 
PLAYERS STEPHEN 
WAS TRYING TO 
PLAYERS STEPHEN WAS TRYING TO DO THE 
RITE THING HE 
THE RITE THING HE REFUSED A LONG POT WHICH 
WAS NOT A 
BAD DECISION 
BUT HE 
DID NOT 
GET A 
AND 
RONNIE KNOCKED 
IN THE LONG 
END OF 
FRAME IT IS 
SCARY 
WELL HE 
IS PLAYING WE SELDOM 
SEE 
WELL HE IS PLAYING WE SELDOM SEE THIS LEVEL OF RUTHLESSNESS RORY RORY HAS MENTIONED THAT 
HE RESPECTS 
HAS MENTIONED THAT HE RESPECTS STEPHEN 
MORE THAN ANY 
STEPHEN MORE THAN ANY OTHER PLAYER AND 
IT MAYBE 
THAT HE WANTS TO 
ALL THE 
RECORDS THAT STEPHEN 
ALL THE RECORDS THAT STEPHEN HAS GOT IT 
IS NOT GETTING 
ANY BETTER GOT IT IS NOT GETTING ANY BETTER FOR STEPHEN HENDRY 
THE LAST FRAME WAS THE FOURTH TODAY IN 
WHICH O'SULLIVAN HAS KEPT HENDRY 
SCORELESS 
JUST FOR ONCE O'SULLIVAN SLIGHTLY 
MISS JUDGES THE SAFETY MISJUDGES 
NOW LET'S SEE THE OTHER PLAYER 
PLAY 
UNCERTAIN THIS PACKED PLAY AUDIENCE HERE THIS EVENING WILL 
ECHO THOSE SENTIMENTS I'M 
CERTAIN GOOD OPENING POT HENDRY COMES A 
LONG POT DOWN 
AT THE OUTSET 
LAST FRAME 
AND NEVER GOT 
LAST FRAME AND NEVER GOT ANOTHER 
CHANCE CAN I JUST ASK YOU TO TURN 
YOUR EARPIECES DOWN THANK YOU THE VOLUME IS ADJUSTABLE ON THOSE YOU 
PIECES GENTS EARPIECES THREE REDS THE BLACKS THREE BLACKS LITTLE 
CANNON ALONG 
LITTLE CANNON ALONG THAT LINE SHOULD LEAVE HIM ON 
THE BLACK YOU 
SHOULD LEAVE HIM ON THE BLACK YOU HEARD 
THE INTAKE 
OF BREATH FROM 
CRUDE THEY 
THOUGHT IT 
WAS GOING 
CRUDE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO STAY THERE BUT GRAVITY TOOK OVER 
THE CROWD 
THIS IS THE SORT OF 
POSITION FROM WHICH ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVENS ARE MADE 
IT REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING TO 
MAKE ONE AT 
THE END 
OF IT WILL 
FRAME LOSING 
STREAK 
AT TWELVE FREE IN 
FRAME LOSING STREAK AT TWELVE FREE IN LOSING STREAK TWELVE FRAME 
HE IS NOT 
PLAYING FOR THE BLACK DIDN'T HAVE 
THE 
ANGLE TO RUN THROUGH IT 
IS ALL 
ABOUT PRIDE 
IN PERFORMANCE FOR 
ABOUT PRIDE IN PERFORMANCE FOR STEPHEN HE WANTS TO WIN FRAMES 
SIMPLE REALISM WILL TELL 
THEM HE IS 
BUT HE 
HAS 
JUST GOT TO 
PLAY EACH 
BUT HE HAS JUST GOT TO PLAY EACH FRAME ON ITS MERITS AND HOPE FOR 
AN OUTSIDE CHANCE OF SOMETHING 
DEVELOPING HE FELT HE GOT A 
SLIGHTLY EERIE 
HE FELT HE GOT A SLIGHTLY EERIE CONTACT 
BUT HE 
IS NICELY ON THE 
CONTACT BUT HE IS NICELY ON THE BLACK HEAVY CONTACT THE RED 
AT THE TOP OF THE 
WILL GO 
TO THE RIGHT CORNER 
IT IS VERY 
DIFFICULT TO 
MAINTAIN 
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN YOUR FAITH IN YOUR ABILITY WHEN ARE TAKING A 
THAT HINDLEY 
ARE TAKING A POUNDING THAT HINDLEY HAS HAD HENDRY BUT HE SEEMS TO 
HAVE DONE SO 
JUST A COUPLE OF REDS AWAY FROM 
WINNING A FRAME HE 
DOESN'T DOUBT 
HIS ABILITY 
BUT 
IT IS 
HARD TO KEEP 
GOING WHEN 
YOU ARE TAKING SUCH 
POUNDING THERE 
IS 
STEPHEN DOES 
HAVE AND THAT HIS 
STEPHEN DOES HAVE AND THAT HIS GREAT BELIEF WE SAW THE NOSE O'SULLIVAN KNOWS 
THIS RED 
WOULD BE ENOUGH TO END HIS 
THIS RED WOULD BE ENOUGH TO END HIS TWELVE FRAME WINNING STREAK 
RONNIE FOR ONCE TODAY HAS SAT AND 
LOOKED ON STEPHEN IS COMPILING A 
FRAME WINNING BREAK 
HE HAS NOT GOT THE CANNON RIGHT A 
BIT CLOSE TO THE 
BLUE HE 
PLAY THE 
PINK IF HE 
DOES NOT FANCY 
PLAY THE PINK IF HE DOES NOT FANCY THE BLUE IT 
IS JUST A 
CASE 
NOW OF 
WHETHER HE CAN MATCH 
MAKE THE 
CENTURY AND HE 
WILL BE 
MAKE THE CENTURY AND HE WILL BE KEEN TO DO IT 
STILL ON COURSE FOR CENTURY NUMBER 
OF HIS CAREER 
NO CENTURY BUT A BREAK OF EIGHTY FIVE 
BREAKS HIS TWELVE FRAME LOSING 
TRAILING TWELVE TO FIVE 
HENDRY PRODUCED THAT FRAME 
FROM 
EXCELLENT OPENING 
RED HE 
TOLD ONE 
EXCELLENT OPENING RED HE TOLD ONE DOWN IN THE OPENING FRAME AND WAS 
LEFT THAT 
YES A SUPERB EIGHTY FIVE HE WAS 
DISAPPOINTED HE DID NOT MAKE THE 
CENTURY HE COULD HAVE TAKING A 
RISK AND MAKE A BIG BID FOR THE 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BUT HE DIDN'T SO HE WANTS TO 
GET THIS INTO THE SESSION TOMORROW 
AND WIN AS MANY FRAMES AS HE CAN 
DECEIVING DECEIVING THIS 
EVENING 
ANOTHER LONG RED BUT THIS TIME 
THE BLACK IS NOT AVAILABLE 
NOW WHERE DOES THE BLACK GO WILL 
IT GO ON ITS OWN SPOT IF IT DOES 
WILL IT BE AVAILABLE IT IS 
THAT IS STEPHEN HENDRY'S SON PLANE 
HIMSELF VERY KEEN PLAYER AND HIS FATHER ON THE RIGHT 
I SPOKE TO HIS FATHER GORDON AND 
WE WERE JUST REFLECTING ON THE 
MORNING SESSION HE SAID THAT 
STEPHEN KNEW WHAT HE HAD TO DO HE 
HAD TO WIN SIX TO TWO TONIGHT SO THEY 
WERE THINKING POSITIVE THEY HENDRY 
CAMP THE HENDRY CAMP 
NOT AN EASY PACK TO GO IN IT OFF 
THE BLUE BUT I THINK THE RED JUST 
ABOVE THE BLACK WILL GO 
DECIDED TO PLAY A LITTLE CANNON HE 
IS GETTING DOWN QUICK SO HE MUST 
BE PERFECT 
NICE ANGLE ON THE BLACK A COUPLE 
OF LOOSE REDS 
HE DECIDED TO GO INTO THE BUNCH HE 
NEEDED A BIT OF LUCK HE HAD NONE 
HOW UNLUCKY IS THAT ON NOTHING 
VERY VERY UNLUCKY HE THEN NICE 
BOUNCED OFF THE CUSHION AND JUST 
DRIFTED 
WE WERE SAYING QUITE A BIT WE 
ALWAYS HAVE DONE WHEN YOU NEED A 
BIT OF LUCK YOU NEVER SEEM TO GET 
IT DO YOU 
HE IS JUST LOOKING IF HE CAN SNICK 
OFF THIS RED AND NOT CATCH THE 
BOMB OF THE MIDDLE POCKET TO 
BUMP 
JUST A BIT PASTY WITH THE CUE BALL 
VERY UNFORTUNATE END TO THAT VISIT 
JUST A BIT PASTY 
IF THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RED 
THAT REALLY HAD TO COVER THE ONE 
TO THE RIGHT CORNER HE HAS DONE 
THAT STEPHEN NOW HAS GOT TO BE 
VERY VERY CAREFUL HE HAS GOT A FIFTY FOUR 
POINT LEAD BUT THE WAY THE REDS 
ARE THERE IS NOT A SAFE BALL ON 
THE TABLE 
LOOK AT THAT RED ON THE RIGHT 
THERE COULD BE A TOUGH RED TO TAKE 
ON THAT WOULD BE A TOUGH RED 
THIS IS WHERE YOU MAKE THE DECISION 
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE IT SAFE 
HE HAD TO JUDGE AT THE WEIGHT 
PERFECT AND AT THE LINE HE DIDN'T 
WANT TO FIND THE GAP 
AND ATTEMPTED SMOTHER SHOT LEAVING 
THE CUE BALL UP AGAINST THE RED 
BUT NOW OF VULNERABLE TO AN 
O'SULLIVAN CLEARANCE THE BLACK IS 
NOT ON ITS SPOT BUT THE WAY 
O'SULLIVAN IS PLAYING THAT MAY NOT 
BE TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM THAT WASN'T THE TIME TO PLAY FOR IT 
COULD BE A KEY SHOT HE HERE IF 
RONNIE PLAYS FOR THE BLACK 
NINETY FIVE PER CENT POT SUCCESS HOW 
CREATURES HOW COURAGEOUS 
AND HE 
LOST FOUR OF THE FIRST FIVE FRAMES 
YESTERDAY 
HE IS HAVING A CLOSE LOOK HE MAY 
HAVE COME JUST A LITTLE TOO 
STRAIGHT 
HE HAS WORK TO DO WITH THE CUE BALL 
HERE JUST COULDN'T GET ENOUGH SIDE 
ON TO AVOID THE RED BUT HE HAS 
RED TO THE LEFT MIDDLE IT IS NOT 
IDEAL BUT 
THAT WAS GOOD SHOT THAT PACE IT WAS PERMISSIBLE OR MISS A BALL 
HE IS JUST MAKING SURE THERE ON 
NERVE FIBRES HANGING OFF THE EDGE 
OF THE TIP TO DISTRACTING THERE 
ARE NO FIBRES 
COULDN'T GET THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE 
BLUE SO A BIT OF WORK TO DO WITH 
THE CUE BALL YOU FEEL THAT WON'T 
POSITIONAL SHOT COULD SET UP A 
FRAME WINNING CHANCE HE HAS MISSED 
IT AND HE IS GOING TO BE ON THE 
RED THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT 
HAS HAPPENED TODAY 
SO STEPHEN WITH A SECOND BITE OF 
THE CHERRY 
WHEN RONNIE WAS DIGGING IN PLAYING 
WITH SIDE LOTS OF LEFT HAND SIDE RED COLOUR RED IS NEEDED 
AND BECAUSE HE HAD THE WRONG 
POTTING ANGLE ON THE RED THIS 
BLACK HE HAS GOT TO GIVE IT DUE 
CARE AND ATTENTION JUST ONE MORE 
RED NEEDED OFF IT AFTER IT 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS WON TWO OF THE 
FIRST THREE OF THE FRAMES IN THIS 
SESSION 
HENDRY IS CERTAINLY CUEING WELL 
ENOUGH TO PUT TOGETHER A SUCCESSION 
OF BIG BREAKS 
BUT HE HAS GOT TO GET THE CHANCES 
TO DO SO EITHER BY KNOCKING IN 
GOOD INITIAL REDS OR BY PREDICTING 
FROM AN O'SULLIVAN MISTAKE 
PROFITING 
PRIOR TO THIS MATCH HENDRY SAID 
IF YOU LET RONNIE GET IN FRONT HE 
WILL BURY YOU AND HENDRY IS 
DETERMINED NOT TO BE BURIED 
BREAKS OF FIFTY FOUR AND FIFTY SIX FROM HENDRY IN 
THAT FRAME BUT O'SULLIVAN IS STILL 
IN THE LEAD 
HE'S A YOUNG SON CERTAINLY APPROVES 
OF HIS DAD'S COMEBACK WHAT DO YOU 
MAKE OF THE WAY HE HAS RALLIED I I THINK HE HAS LOOKED EXCELLENT HE 
WAS UNLUCKY NOT TO WIN THE FRAME IN 
ONE VISIT WHEN GOING INTO THE PACK 
HE ENDED UP TOUCHING BALL AND 
REALLY GOT BACK IN 
YOU SENSE HE IS 
HAVING TO GO FOR SOME OF THE LONGER 
POT IT LOOKS LIKE HE MAY HAVE TO 
GO FOR BROKE HERE 
HE KNOCKED THEM 
BOTH IN AND VIRTUALLY ONE BUT 
FRAMES FROM THAT HE ALMOST LOST 
THAT FRAME BUT RONNIE DID PLAY A 
SHOT WHERE HE DID NOT GET THE RIGHT 
SIDE OF THE BLUE HE IS BRIDGING ON 
THE CUSHION PLAYING IT 
HAND SIDE AND HE JUST TOOK HIS EYE 
OFF THE POT HE WAS COME TO 
DREDGING ON WHERE HE WAS PUTTING 
THE WHITE BUT STEPHEN IN FAIRNESS 
DESERVE TO WIN THAT 
THE AIMS ARE 
CHANGING AS THE MATCH PROGRESSES 
IT IS TO MAKE IT RESPECTABLE AT 
THE MOMENT FOR STEPHEN HOW 
IMPORTANT IS IT TO SUMMON MEMORIES 
OF COMEBACKS YOU HAVE MANAGED IN 
THE PAST 
HE HAS WON TEN FRAMES IN A 
ROW HERE IN A FINAL AGAINST JIMMY 
WHITE I THINK JIMMY WHITE WAS 
LEADING HIM SO THOSE ARE THE 
THOUGHTS YOU HAVE IN YOUR MIND 
WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN YOUR CHAIR 
THINK POSITIVELY 
GET OUT OF THIS 
SESSION SIX TO TWO AHEAD AND ANYTHING IS 
POSSIBLE 
IN THIS CHAMPIONSHIP HENDRY HAS 
MANAGED TO ACCESS SOME OF HIS GREAT 
PAST AND HAS LOOKED ALTOGETHER 
MORE FORMIDABLE THAN HE HAS LOOKED 
ALL SEASON OR INDEED ALL LAST 
SEASON HE HAS ONLY REACHED ONE 
SEMI FINAL ON THE ROAD TO SHEFFIELD 
HE PLAYED THAT SNOOKER BEHIND THE 
BLACK HE PURPOSELY PLAYED THE RED 
WITH A BIT OF PACE TO LOOSEN THE 
CLUSTER RONNIE HAS GOT TO BE A 
LITTLE BIT CAREFUL HERE THIS IS 
NOT A FORMALITY TO GET OUT OF THIS 
AND NOT LEAVE A CHANCE THAT WAS A 
CLEVER SHOT FROM STEPHEN IT IS 
GOING TO MAKE REALLY THINK A BIT 
RONNIE THINK A BIT IF HE 
DOESN'T CATCH THE RIGHT RED HE 
COULD LEAVE THE RED ONTO THE MIDDLE 
POCKET 
AND THAT IS WHAT HE HAS DONE O. K. 
IT IS A DIFFICULT SHOT BUT MAYBE 
RONNIE TOOK THAT INTO ACCOUNT 
BRIDGING OVER FOUR BALLS HERE IT WAS DIFFICULT 
HE PLAYED IT SLOWLY TO GIVE IT 
EVERY CHANCE TO GO IN THE POCKET 
BUT IT IS SO DIFFICULT THAT SHOT 
BECAUSE THE CUE BALL AND THE OBJECT 
BALL ARE NOT IN YOUR EYE LINE AND 
YOU'RE STRIKING DOWN 
BUT IT WAS HALF A CHANCE IN THE 
CONTEXT OF THIS MATCH AND NOW 
RONNIE AT THE TABLE AND THE REDS 
ARE NICELY SPREAD AS SOON AS HE 
CAN HE WILL PLAY FOR THE RED JUST 
ABOVE THE BLACK AND GET THE BLACK 
AVAILABLE THIS IS A DECENT CHANCE 
THIS 
HE PLAYED FOR THE ONE ABOVE THE 
BLACK BUT HE IS NOT STRAIGHT ON IT 
IF HE POTS IT HE'S GOING TO CANNON 
THE BLACK HE HAS TO JUDGE THIS CANNON WELL THIS BLACK IS DIFFICULT 
IT WAS TRICKY BUT HE MADE LIGHT 
WORK OF IT 
O'SULLIVAN DETERMINED TO REASSERT 
HIMSELF AND SNUFF OUT ANY 
INCIPIENT HENDRY REVIVAL 
EASY TO ROLL THE BLACK IN BUT 
WORTH PLAYING THE CANNON HERE 
COMEDY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
HE JUDGED TO CANNON NICELY IF HE 
MISSED IT HE WOULD HAVE DRIFTED 
PAST IT AND IN CLEARING THAT HE 
MADE THIS RED AVAILABLE AND THE 
ONE THAT HE CANNONED 
HE IS LOOKING HAS HE RUN TO FALL 
SURELY NOT HAS HE RUN TOO FAR 
NO HE COULD JUST GET TO THE RED 
TO WIN THE FRAME AT THIS VISIT HE 
STILL DON'T HAVE TO PLAY A LITTLE 
CANNON HE STILL GOING TO HAVE TO 
PLAY A LITTLE CANNON LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE SCORE NOW 
IF HE GOT TWO REDS TWO BLACKS HE 
WOULD BE JUST PAST THE WINNING LINE 
THE BLUE AND A RED AND THE BLACK 
WOULD PUT HIM SIXTY EIGHT IN FRONT WITH SIXTY SEVEN 
LEFT SO HE DOESN'T HAVE TO TRY AND 
DEVELOP ANYTHING THE BALLS THAT HE 
NEEDS A RUN THE OPEN ARE IN THE 
OPEN 
EVERY TIME THAT O'SULLIVAN HAS GOT 
PROPERLY IN TODAY HE HAS WON THE 
FRAME FROM IT 
BARRING A SNOOKER THAT IS ANOTHER 
FRAME FOR HIM HENDRY CONCEDES FOURTEEN TO EIGHT IT IS FOURTEEN TO SIX 
HOW OMINOUS IS IT LOOKING FOR 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
JUST ONE CHANCE 
AGAIN BUT STEPHEN WAS UNLUCKY 
BRIDGING OVER A RED AND DIDN'T 
MANAGE TO CONVERT THE RED INTO THE 
MIDDLE POCKET ONCE AGAIN RONNIE 
ONE CHANCE AND HE OPENS THE FRAME 
BOTH MEN DIFFERENT AGENDAS NOW 
RONNIE IS FAVOURITE TO WIN THE 
MATCH REGARD THIS HE WILL BE 
TRYING TO WIN THE NEXT SESSION THREE TO ONE 
HE WANTS TO HOLD SO TODAY OFF TO 
RELAX IF HE HAS THE WHOLE SATURDAY 
OFF MAYBE CAN RUN MARATHON 
ARE PROUD CHAMPION LIKE STEPHEN HENDRY 
WILL BE TRYING SO HARD NOT TO LET 
THAT HAPPEN 
I HONESTLY HOPE IT 
GOES TO A THIRD SESSION HENDRY HAS 
BEEN A GENIUS AND A GENTLEMAN OVER 
THE YEARS HE IS TOO GOOD A PLAYER 
TO LOSE WITH A SESSION TO SPARE DO DO YOU GENUINELY BELIEVE STEPHEN 
HENDRY BELIEVES HE CAN STILL WIN A 
ABSOLUTELY HE'S VERY VERY PROUD 
PLAYER AND MAKE A MISTAKE HE HAS 
DONE THIS TO PLAYERS TOP PLAYERS 
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER SO HE WILL 
BE THINKING ONLY ONE PLAYER CAN 
PLAY ON THE TABLE AT ANY ONE TIME 
STEPHEN WILL BE SAYING IT MIGHT AS 
WELL BE HIM 
IF HE HAS ALREADY NICK 
AGAINST JIMMY WHITE HE HAS DONE 
WHAT HE WANTED TO DO ANY OTHER 
SCORE LINE 
THEY HAVE A BIT OF 
THINKING TO DO OVER THEIR HALF TIME 
INTERVAL THIS HASN'T BEEN THE 
GREATEST CHAMPIONSHIP FOR THE IRISH 
NO ONE FROM THE NORTH OR THE SOUTH 
HAS MANAGED TO GET PASSED ROUND TWO 
DESPITE THAT DENNIS TAYLOR 
CONTINUES TO SMILE BUT SO DOES 
FELLOW COMEDIAN PATRICK KIELTY 
IT CONJURES UP MEET AT ABOUT EIGHT 
YEARS OF AGE ON CHRISTMAS MORNING 
COMING DOWN AND HAVING SIX F. T. 
SNOOKER TABLE WHICH WENT OVER THE 
TOP OF THE DINING TABLE AND IT 
FOURIE AND MY BROTHER WAS ALEX 
HIGGINS IF YOU GROW UP IN NORTHERN 
ON AND IN THE SEVENTIES AND 
EIGHTIES AND SOMEBODY SAID I. M. 
ALEX HIGGINS THERE WAS NOWHERE 
ELSE TO GO SO I ENDED UP BEING 
DENNIS TAYLOR BUT THAT WAS BEFORE 
HE WON THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP SO 
THAT WAS NOT CALL NOT COOL THE 
ONE THAT STICKS IN MY MIND WAS WHEN 
CLIFF THORBURN GOT THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THAT 
WAS THE BIG THING PEOPLE WERE 
CALLING PEOPLE IN ON THE STREET 
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS THAT SOMEHOW 
STICKS IN MY MIND JUST BECAUSE IT 
WAS THE FIRST TIME IT WAS DONE AND 
IT WAS AT THE GRINDER L. REMEMBER THAT REALLY WELL GOOD LUCK MATE 
WE USED TO HUSTLE POOL IN AMERICA 
IN BARS NOT BECAUSE WE WERE VERY 
GOOD WE WERE NOT VERY GOOD BUT 
WHEREVER YOU PLAYED SNOOKER WITH 
SMALL POCKET IN A BIG TABLE YOU 
WOULD GO TO THESE PARTS IN AMERICA 
WE USED TO WIN A LOT OF MONEY 
THESE BARS L. THINK I'M LOT 
BETTER THAN I REALLY AM AND I DO 
HAVE THE THAT THINK I IMMEDIATELY 
NEED FOR COMPLIANCE IN ME BEFORE 
THE CUE ACTION IS ACCEPTABLE I 
NEED FOUR POINTS ANY A BIG BREAK 
IS LIKE A GIRL WALKING PAST IN A 
SHORT SKIRT YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK 
WHEREAS THE TACTICAL BATTLE IS 
WITH I MARRY HER SO THE TACTICAL 
BATTLE IS WHAT WOULD DRAW ME IN 
THERE IS NOTHING BETTER 
I FIND THAT SNOOKER HE DOES IS ME 
HYPNOTISE ME HAVE TO STAY AWAY 
BRIT IS ON TELEVISION IT DOESN'T 
MATTER WHO IS PLAYING IF I SIT 
THROUGH THREE FRAMES THAT IS IT 
YOU CAN CANCEL ANYTHING I WILL BE 
IN THE SAME UNDERPANTS ORDERING 
PIZZA I MIGHT TURN UP IN SHEFFIELD 
IT MIGHT BE QUITE NICE JUST FOR 
THE FINAL SESSION OF THE FINAL 
EVERYONE IS IN THEIR TUXEDO I WILL 
BEAT THERE IN MY JOCKEY Y. FRONTS 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE 
WELCOME 
THAT CONJURES UP QUITE AN IMAGE 
NOT COOL BEING THE WAIT TILL I 
SEE YOU 
THEN YOU WERE THE COOLEST 
MAN ON THE PLANET WE HAVE ALL 
MARVELLED AT AROUND STEVE DAVIS 
OVER THE YEARS AND HE IS STILL IN 
THE TOP SIXTEEN AT THE AGE OF FIFTY UNTIL 
TUESDAY AT ANY RATE BUT HE IS NOT 
THE OLDEST PLAYER TO HAVE FEATURED 
HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE THIS IS THE 
THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF A QUITE 
EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT 
THE AMAZING FRED DAVIS MADE IT TO 
THE SEMI FINALS OF THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP AT THE AGE OF SIXTY FOUR 
HE WAS SUCH A GENT HE KNEW EVERY 
MOVE POSSIBLE ON THE SNOOKER TABLE 
HIS SENSE OF HUMOUR WAS SUPERB 
SOMEBODY EVERYBODY ASPIRED TO BE 
HE WAS THE ULTIMATE PROFESSIONAL 
THE ULTIMATE SWEETHEART 
HE WILL BE 
REMEMBERED AS THE CHEEKY SMILING 
CHAP HE USED TO IRRITATE UNCLE JOE 
WHO USED TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT 
CONCENTRATING WHEN HE WAS SMILING 
FRED LIVED A BIT IN THE SHADOW OF 
JOE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW A 
LOT ABOUT THE GAME RECKONED THAT 
FRED IT MIGHT EVEN HAVE BEEN 
BETTER PLAYER THAN JOE 
PEOPLE ARE 
ALWAYS MAKING UNFAIR COMPARISONS 
FRED WAS A GREAT PLAYER IN HIS OWN 
RIGHT 
HIS FAVOURITE TROPHY WAS THE VERY 
FIRST TROPHY HE WON THE BOYS 
PROFESSIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP THINK 
HE WON IT'S A TO SIXTEEN YEAR OLD HE 
WON IT ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS 
THAT WAS THE ONE TROPHY HE PRISED BOBBLE 
HE HAD THAT CUE ACTION ALWAYS 
SMILING AS HE HAD HIS FOOT ON YOUR 
THROAT 
IN HIS EARLY CAREER HE THROAT COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO PRACTICE 
HE WENT TO A TOURNAMENT IN 
AUSTRALIA IN NINETEEN SIXTY NEVER HIT A BALL 
UNTIL THE TOURNAMENT STARTED AND 
HE DEMOLISHED EVERYBODY 
WHAT A 
TOUGH COMPETITOR ON THE SNOOKER 
TABLE HE USED TO HAVING MANNERISM 
YOU WOULD PLAY INTO THE REDS HE 
SPUN ROUND LAUGHED AT THE CROWD 
THEN HE WOULD GO DOWN AND LOOK AT 
HIS SHOT YOU WOULD THINK YOU HAD A 
CHANCE AND YOU WOULD LOOK AT THE 
BALL AND YOU WOULD THINK THERE IS 
NO WAY THAT WILL GO THEN IT FRED 
WOULD GET DOWN AND STRUCK THE BALL 
INTO THE POCKET YOU USED TO THINK 
YOU OLD DEVIL FRED 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HE REACHED THE SEMI FINALS 
THE LAST TIME BUT HE GOT THAT FAR 
IN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS THAT 
WAS NOT FAR FOR SOMEBODY OF THE AGE 
OF SIXTY FOUR 
THE SHOT I. ALWAYS REMEMBER 
HE PLAYED A SOUTH AFRICAN IN THE 
SEMI FINAL HE WAS CLEARING UP TO 
WIN THE FRAME IT WAS REALLY CLOSE 
HE HAS A STRAIGHT PINK 
AND HE MISSED IT EVERYBODY WAS 
AGHAST AND FRED IT COULDN'T 
BELIEVE IT IT WAS THE EASIEST POT 
OF ALL WHAT I REMEMBER I WALKED 
OUT BACKSTAGE AND HIS BROTHER JOE 
HAD BEEN WATCHING THE MAX AND HE 
WAS STUMPED IN THE CHAIR 
THAT FEAT WILL NEVER BE DONE AGAIN 
IF SAFETY PLAY WAS MORE IMPORTANT 
I THINK HE FELT DISAPPOINTED HE 
HAD BEEN SO CLOSE BUT VERY PLEASED 
THAT HE PUT UP SUCH A GOOD 
PERFORMANCE HE WAS STILL PLAYING 
PROFESSIONALLY AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY NINE 
NOT MANY PROFESSIONAL SPORTSMAN YOU 
CAN SAY THAT ABOUT L. WOULD LIKE TO 
THINK THAT THE LEGACY HE HAS LEFT 
IS A BUOYANT GAME L. THINK THE GAME 
WILL GO FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH 
I KNOW IF IT WASN'T FOR MY FATHER 
AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS KEEPING 
THE GAME ALIVE WHEN IT WAS IN THE 
DOLDRUMS THERE WOULD BE NO SLICK 
ENOUGH MOST SNOOKER NOW 
WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST MEMORY OF HIM 
POT BLACK WAS DOWN IN THE 
DRESSING ROOM AND FRED CAME DOWN 
SO HOLD THE DOOR OPEN FOR HIM HE 
THANKED ME AND PROCEEDED TO TALK 
TO ME WITH HIS CUE IN HIS HANDS 
FOR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES HE WAS A REAL 
GENTLEMAN 
AND SUCH A GOOD PLAYER GENTLEMAN TO SUCH A RIPE OLD AGE CAN YOU PUT 
INTO CONTEXT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF 
MAKING THE SEMI FINALS AT THE AGE 
OF SIXTY FOUR 
THE THING WAS BREAK 
BUILDING WAS NOT A KEY ELEMENT IN 
SNOOKER IN THOSE TIMES AND FRED 
WAS ONE OF THE BEST SAFETY PLAYERS 
OF ALL TIMES HE ALWAYS PUT YOU IN 
TROUBLE HE DIDN'T MAKE THE CENTURY 
BREAKS ALL THE TIME BUT HE WAS 
ALWAYS PUTTING YOU IN A POSITION 
WHERE IT WAS HARD TO WIN HE WAS 
ONE OF THE NICEST GUYS I HAVE ADDED 
PRESSURE OF PLAYING AGAINST 
MISSING THAT PINK WILL ALWAYS LIVE 
IN MY MEMORY 
DO YOU THINK STEVE 
DAVIS WILL BE CUEING AT SIXTY FOUR 
PROBABLY WHEN HE IS ONE HUNDRED LOVELY LOVELY MEMORIES OF FRED DAVIS OVER THE 
SNOOKER SEASON THE INSIDES THAT 
OUR GRAPHOLOGIST ELAINE QUIGLEY HAS 
OFFERED HAS INTRIGUED AND SPRINTERS 
IN EQUAL MEASURES SHE HAS NEVER 
MET MYSELF FOR RAY OR ANY OF THE 
PLAYERS OR COMMENTATORS UNTIL 
YESTERDAY YET SHE HAS ANALYSED OUR 
HANDWRITING AND COME UP WITH SOME 
INTERESTING HOME TRUTHS 
THREE PEOPLE HAVE KINDLY GIVEN ME A 
SELECTION OF ITEMS A TREE STARS 
OVER THE SEA AND HANDWRITING 
WANT TO GET COMPOSITE OF WHAT 
THEY ARE LIKE LOOKING AT THE 
WRITING FIRST WE HAVE UPWARD 
SLOPING LINES THEY ARE SLIPPING UP 
RATHER TOO MUCH SO IT SHOWS THAT 
THIS PERSON AND IT'S PUTTING EFFORT 
INTO BEING A POSITIVE MAYBE 
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO THIS 
PARTICULAR TASK STRONG PERSONAL 
PRONOUNS NICE FLOWERING WRITING 
FLOWING WRITING THAT USUALLY 
MEANS THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE 
EXPOSED OR TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES 
IT ALSO CAN MEAN AN ACADEMIC 
APPROACH TO LIFE THE BIG WIDE 
MARGIN OVER FROM THE RIGHT SIDE 
MUCH NARROW ON THE LEFT THIS IS 
TELLING ME THAT THIS PERSON DOES 
NOT WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT THIS AT 
ALL HE WANTS TO BE HIS OWN MAN HE 
HAS A LOT OF WARMTH IN HIS WRITING 
THE FACT THAT HE IS AN INDIVIDUAL 
HE DOES NOT WANT PEOPLE TO PRY INTO 
HIS INDIVIDUALITY 
TO FIND OUT WHETHER THIS IS A TRUE 
STORY FIRST THE TREE BEARS THIS 
OUT IT IS VERY SMALL PRIVATE TREE IN THE TOP OF THE PAGE IT HAS THEY ARE BOTH QUITE WELL 
DRAWN HE IS SAYING I AM FINE 
THIS IS WHO I AM BUT I AM NOT 
SHARING WITH YOU IF WE LOOK AT THE 
STARS AND THE WAVES THE STARS HAVE 
NO TWINKLE NO REAL LIFE TO THEM 
THEY ARE VERY EVENLY PLACED NOT 
NATURAL NOT LOOKING LIVELY THEN 
WE HAVE THIS RATHER LARGE BOWL 
SHAPED POLICE OF PIECE OF PLAIN 
STROKE WITH THE WAVES UNDERNEATH IT 
THIS PERSON AGAIN IS SAYING IT IS 
NOT YOUR BUSINESS WHAT I AM LIKE 
WE KNOW THAT HE HAS EMOTIONS THE 
WAVES UNDERNEATH WE KNOW THAT HE 
HAS SOME GOALS THE STARS BUT HE 
IS KEEPING IT TO HIMSELF THE NEXT 
ONE IS VERY MUCH DIFFERENT PIECE 
OF WRITING FIRST WE HAVE A LOVELY 
FLOWING WRITING IT SLOPES TO THE 
RIGHT VERY EVEN IT IS SOMEONE WHO 
IS A VERY CAREFUL PREPARATION 
PERSON WHATEVER HE DOES HE HAS TO 
DO IT THE BEST HE CAN IT IS NOT A 
HEAVY PRESSURED WRITING THERE IS A 
CALMNESS ABOUT IT IT IS NICE TO 
LAID OUT THE MARGIN ON THE LEFT IS 
GOOD HE FEELS COMFORTABLE IN HIS 
SKIN IF WE LOOK AT HIS TREE IT IS 
A NICE TREE IT HAS PROPER SHAPE 
NOT SHOVED IN THE CORNER A STRONG 
TRUNK AND LOTS OF LEAVES LOTS OF 
LEAVES ME IN PRODUCTIVITY HE HAS 
PRODUCTIVE THINKING PATTERNS WILL 
STOP NO IMPEDIMENTS IN THE TRUNK 
THAT DOES MEAN THAT HE FEELS THAT 
WHATEVER HE IS DOING HE DOES IT 
STRAIGHT AWAY HE DOES NOT HAVE TO 
WORRY ABOUT WHETHER HE IS GOING TO 
BE UNHAPPY WITH SOMETHING 
SOMETHING IS GOING TO GET IN THE 
WAY IT IS COMFORTABLE TREE IF 
YOU FEEL THE BACK THERE IS NO 
PRESSURE ON THE BACK THERE IS NO 
PRESSURE ON THE BACK OF THE WRITING 
WHICH MEANS THIS PERSON IS VERY 
SENSITIVE TO PEOPLE AND ATMOSPHERE 
COMING TO THE STARS AND THE WAVES 
THE EMOTIONS ARE CALM BUT THERE 
ARE PLENTY OF THEM HE IS NOT EMPTY 
HE HAS LOTS OF WARMTH IN HIM THE 
STARS ARE QUITE BUSY THAT IS 
FAULT SKY HE HAS LOTS OF IDEAS AND 
AMBITIONS BUT NOT MAJOR THE STARS 
ARE QUITE SMALL BUT HE IS QUITE 
CONTENT THIS IS THE LAST ONE I WAS 
GIVEN WE HAVE THE WRITING THE 
WRITING IS VERY FLOWING WRITING 
WHICH CAN BE PLEASANT AND WARM BUT 
IT IS ALL OVER THE PLACE TOO 
THERE IS A LOT OF EMOTION WHICH IS 
NOT SHOWN I THINK L. GET THE 
IMPRESSION OF THE WAY THE WRITING 
IS PUT TOGETHER WITH LETTERS GOING 
BACK TO THE LEFT HE MIGHT BE 
OUTGOING IN BEHAVIOUR BUT NOT TO 
SHARE WITH OTHER PEOPLE HIMSELF 
THERE IS LOT OF ENERGY HE NEEDS 
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO PUSH HIM 
INTO THE STRATOSPHERE SOME NEW 
EXCITEMENT OR SOMETHING TO SET HIM 
GOING THE TREE SHOWS VERY STRONG 
TRUNK IT HAS GOT ROOTS BUT IT 
JUST HAS BRANCHES AT THE TOP NO 
LEAVES SO IT IS BEARING OUT THE 
FACT THAT HE HAS THIS ENERGY AND 
HIS WANTING SOMEWHERE TO PUT IT 
WHERE HE IS GOING TO MAKE SOME NEW 
FRESH SPURT IN HIS LIFE SOME NEW 
EXPERIENCE TO MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD 
IF WE LOOK AT THE STARS AND THE 
WAVES THE SAME STORY WE HAVE GOOD 
EMOTION NICE AND FIRM AND PLENTY 
OF IT IF THERE WERE STARS IN THE 
PAST THAT WERE SPARKLY BUT 
BECOMING STARS ARI BIT STAID HE 
NEEDS FIRING UP L. WONDER WHAT NEW 
CHALLENGE HE COULD FIND BUT A NEW 
CHALLENGE HE NEEDS THAT WOULD MAKE 
HIM FLY HE HAS SO MUCH ENERGY PENT 
UP BUT IT NEEDS TO BE DIRECTED TO 
WHERE IT WILL DO THE MOST GOOD 
VERY NICE NICE TRUNK DENNIS WERE 
YOU SURPRISED DID YOU RECOGNISE 
YOURSELF 
IT IS A BIT SPOOKY YOURSELF BECAUSE I HAVE WATCHED MOST OF THEM 
ABOUT THE PLAYERS AND SHE IS VERY 
ACCURATE 
I HAVE NOT SEEN HER ACCURATE ANALYSIS OF YOU WILLIE BUT IT 
WILL BE INTERESTING 
SHE HAS NOT 
CAUGHT UP WITH ME YET STRAIGHT STRAIGHT BACK TO THE COMMENTARY BOX BECAUSE 
WE ARE ABOUT TO SEE THE REST OF 
TONIGHT'S SEMI FINAL THERE THEY 
ARE THAT GREAT BALL OF UNLEASHED 
ENERGY JOHN VIRGO AND THE SHY 
PRIVATE CLIVE EVERTON WHAT DID YOU 
MAKE OF HER FINDINGS 
I WAS 
FLATTERED TO BE TOLD THAT MY TREE 
WAS WELL DRAWN L. HAVE NOT DRAWN 
ANYTHING SINCE I WAS AT SCHOOL HER 
ANALYSIS WAS ON THE MONEY I 
THOUGHT 
I WOULD 
HAVE TO AGREE L. THOUGHT HAVE BEEN WRITING AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
FOR SEVEN YEARS AND HAVE NOT 
FINISHED IT SO I DO NEED A PUSH IN 
THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOURTEEN TO SIXTY TWO O'SULLIVAN 
IF HE COULD WIN THREE OF THE FOUR 
REMAINING FRAMES THIS EVENING HE 
WOULD RENDER TOMORROW AFTERNOON'S 
FINAL SESSION OBSOLETE 
HE NEEDS TO CATCH THIS RIGHT OR HE 
WILL LEAVE READ ON AND HE HAS 
HE HAS LEFT THE RED TO THE LEFT 
CENTRE THERE IS POSSIBLY ONE TO 
THE LEFT CORNER AS WELL HE IS 
MIGHTY CLOSE TO IT THOUGH 
IF HE PLAYS THE ONE TO THE LEFT 
CORNER THE REFEREE WILL BE HAVING 
A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT IT 
AS WE SAW IN THE LAST FRAME 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAD ONE TO THAT SAME 
POCKET BRIDGING OVER FOUR BALLS IS 
NOT EASY IT CAUGHT RUNNY OUT AS 
IT DID STEPHEN RONNIE CHOICE OF REDS 
THAT WAS A BIG SHOT HE DID NOT 
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE CUE 
BALL TO BE ON THE BLACK BUT HE 
NEEDED TO GET IT 
I AM ASSUMING HE WILL PUT THE LOOSE 
THREADS SO THE POINT OF INTEREST 
WILL BE HOW HE DEVELOPS THE BUNCH 
THE LOOSE REDS 
O'SULLIVAN LOVES THE BIG STAGE AND 
LOVES TO PUT ON SHOW 
AND THE FURTHER HE IS IN FRONT THE 
MORE HE CAN FORGET ABOUT THE RESULT 
AND JUST CONCENTRATE ON PERFORMING 
THE THING ABOUT THE GREAT PLAYERS 
WHEN THEY GET IN FRONT THEY ARE 
NOT LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDER 
JUST LOOKING AHEAD 
HE IS INCH PERFECT ON THE BLUE 
COULD NOT HAVE PLAYED THAT ANY 
BETTER 
IT IS LIKE A DIFFERENT VENUE 
COMPLETELY YOU HEAR APPLAUSE AND 
NOISE FROM THE OTHER TABLE ELEVEN THE 
TOURNAMENT BUT IT IS CATHEDRAL LIKE 
NOW 
LET'S SEE HIM TRY TO STUN ROUND OFF 
TWO CUSHIONS FOR THE RED TO THE 
RIGHT OF THE BLACK AS USUAL 
PERFECT 
O'SULLIVAN HAS GOT HIS GAME AND 
MORE IMPORTANTLY HIS MIND INTO 
OPTIMUM SHAPE FOR THIS CHAMPIONSHIP 
HE HAS HAD A FEW IMPLOSIONS HERE 
BUT THIS IS REMARKABLE EXHIBITION OF SUSTAINED EXCELLENCE ANOTHER FRAME IN THE BAG 
O'SULLIVAN IN PURSUIT OF HIS ELEVEN 
CENTURY OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP THE 
SIXTIETH OF THE TOURNAMENT IN TOTAL 
IT IS HIS FOURTH CENTURY OF THE DAY 
COMING UP 
THE RECORD FOR AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP AS HE MAKES 
THAT CENTURY IS HELD BY STEPHEN 
HENDRY WITH SIXTEEN CENTURY BREAKS THAT 
WILL BE ANOTHER TARGET FOR RONNIE 
STEPHEN HAD THE MOST MAXIMUMS WITH 
EACH BUT RONNIE BETTER THAT WITH 
NINE IN TOURNAMENT PLAY NOW 
CLOSING IN ON THAT RECORD SIXTEEN 
CENTURIES IN THE TOURNAMENT 
EXCELLENCE ON THE SCALE OF TIGER 
WOODS ROGER FEATHER FEDERER OR 
ANY OTHER SUPREME ALL TIME GREAT 
YOU CARE TO MENTION 
EVEN FROM THE STRAIGHT ANGLE ON THE 
BLUE HE OVER RAN IT BUT WHAT CUE 
POWER 
THERE WE HAVE IT THAT WAS THE SIXTY 
CENTURY OF THIS YEAR'S CHAMPIONSHIP 
AND WE ARE CLOSING IN ON THE RECORD 
OF SIXTY EIGHT THERE IS EVERY LIKELIHOOD 
THAT WILL BE BEATEN IF RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN CONTINUES TO PLAY LIKE 
THIS WHAT WAS THE KEY SHOT IN THAT 
LAST FRAME 
THE SPLIT HE MADE ON 
THE REDS WAS SUPERB TALK US 
THROUGH THIS WILLIE 
LOTS OF 
PLAYERS WOULD PLAY THIS WITH DEEP 
SCREW RONNIE HAS A WONDERFUL 
CUEING ACTION THAT HE PUSHES 
THROUGH THE BALL AND BEFORE THE 
SPIN TAKES IT IS GOING THROUGH THE 
PACK YOU SAW SEVEN OR EIGHT REDS 
GOING INTO PLAY 
THE POSITION WAS 
PERFECT HE CONCENTRATED ON THAT AS 
WELL 
HE SEEMS TO BE CRUISING ROUND WELL THE TABLE 
THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN 
AMAZED HOW QUICKLY RONNIE CAN PLAY 
HE DOES NOT EVER FEEL PRESSURE AND 
BREAK BUILDING SOME PLAYERS GET TO 
THE SIXTY MARK AND OF A SUDDEN GET 
EXCITED 
IT IS JUST A MATTER OF EXCITED TIME THE CAUSE NO MATTER HOW WELL 
STEPHEN HENDRY PLAYS IF HE GETS A 
CHANCE WE KNOW WHAT RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN IS GOING TO DO 
THE ONLY CRUMB OF COMFORT FOR 
STEPHEN HENDRY IS THAT HE CANNOT 
LOSE SEVENTEEN TO FOUR 
SETTLE DOWN PLEASE 
REMEMBER THIS IS A WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 
THERE YOU GO CAN HE GET PAST THE 
BLUE TO CLIP THAT RED HE CANNOT 
SEE ANYTHING ELSE HAWKEYE THINKS 
HE CAN GET PAST THE BLUE 
AND FINDING THE PATH BETWEEN THE 
GREEN AND BROWN TOP OF THE TABLE 
FROM STEPHEN YOU CANNOT PLAY A 
SAFETY SHOT ANY BETTER THAN THAT 
APPLAUSE BUT HE WILL NOT BE HAPPY 
WITH THAT ONE BECAUSE 
HE HAS 
LEFT A 
RED TO THE LEFT CORNER 
WE WILL WELL THE POTTING 
MACHINE HAS BROKEN DOWN 
HE HAS 
MISSED IT BUT HE HAS LEFT NOTHING 
TOUCHING BALL DECLARED SHOULD BE 
QUITE AN EASY PATH BACK TO THE 
BAULK END FOR STEPHEN TOUCHING 
BALL YOU FIRE AWAY FROM THE RED 
YOU ARE TOUCHING YOU ARE DEEMED TO 
HAVE HIT IT 
THAT'S THE EIGHTY ONE YEAR OLD TROPHY 
PURCHASED WITH HALF THE ENTRY FEES 
OF THE FIRST CHAMPIONSHIP IN THE 
NINETEEN TWENTY SIX TO TWENTY SEVEN SEASON 
STEPHEN HENDRY'S NAME IS ON IT 
SEVEN TIMES BUT NOT FOR AN EIGHTH TIME 
THIS SEASON IT LOOKS LIKE 
STEPHEN HAVING A LOOK AT THESE TWO 
REDS BELOW THE PINK BELOW THE 
PINK L. DON'T KNOW WHY IT WOULD 
INTEREST THEM HE CANNOT GET 
THROUGH TO IT UNLESS HE PLAYS A 
CANNON OFF ANOTHER RED BUT THAT 
WOULD BE VERY RISKY 
IT COULD BE MADE BUT FROM WHERE HE 
IS THE PINK IS IN THE WAY 
OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T SEE A RETURN TO 
BAULK THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH 
PRESSURE ON STEPHEN ALL DAY WITH 
RONNIE'S PLAY EVERY SHOT HE IS 
FRIGHTENED THAT ONE MISTAKE COULD 
BE HIS LAST HE THOUGHT IF HE GOT 
THIS BALL NEAR THE TOP CUSHION HE 
MAY NOT LEAVE A RED BUT THERE IS 
CERTAINLY ONE ON TO THE LEFT MIDDLE 
WHICH RORY COULD PLAY AND RUN TO 
THE BAULK END RONNIE 
AND THE DEAL IS ON AS A COLOUR 
YEAR OLD YELLOW 
IT WAS DIFFICULT EVEN THE WAY OF 
SOLOMON IS PLAYING O'SULLIVAN 
HE KNEW THAT IF HE MISSED IT 
HENDRY WOULD BE PLAYING COUPLE OF 
INCHES FROM THE BAULK CUSHION HE HE HAS GOT TO CATCH THIS JUST RIGHT 
AND HE HAS MISSED IT ON THE WAY UP 
WHAT HAS HE LEFT CERTAINLY THE 
RED TO THE RIGHT OF THE BLUE IS IN 
THE OPEN THE ONE CLOSEST TO THE 
CUE BALL DOES IT GO IN THE RIGHT 
CORNER JUST ABOUT BUT YOU WOULD 
LIKE TO BE RIGHT BEHIND IT THE ONE 
TO THE RIGHT OF THE BLUE IS THE 
BETTER OPTION SURELY NOT 
STEPHEN SMILES THE LAST THING 
RONNIE NEEDS AT THE MOMENT HIS TO HE WHO HATH IT IS GIVEN 
ALL THE WAY ALONG THE BAULK CUSHION 
AND IN OFF THE YELLOW QUITE 
POSSIBLY THE START OF ANOTHER 
FRAME WINNING BREAK 
HINDLEY WAS ABOUT TO GET UP AND 
THEN REALISED HE DIDN'T HAVE TO 
HENDRY HE WAS PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT 
IT YOU HAVE TO BE 
THIS HAS GONE SLIGHTLY WRONG HE 
CANNOT GET TO THE YELLOW BECAUSE OF 
THE BLUE 
THIS COULD BE END OF THE IS IT 
DOES IT VISIT 
HE TO BE LOOKING FOR THE SAFETY HE LOOKS HE KNEW THAT IT WASN'T A NATURAL IN OFF 
HENDRY'S CERTAINLY GOT THE CUE BALL 
ON THE RIGHT DIAGONAL 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE RONNIE 
STEPHEN YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY 
HELP FROM ANYBODY HERE THAT IS 
REMARKABLE 
TWO OUTRAGEOUS FLUKES THAT RONNIE 
HAS CAUGHT 
OFF THE BLUE INTO THE POCKET IT 
IS A CRUEL GAME 
IF HE WAS PLAYING THAT WITH THE 
REST HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING 
TO PLAY THAT SHOT LEFT HANDED 
JUST A NATURAL 
RONNIE HAS HAD A COUPLE OF BITS OF 
GOOD FORTUNE THAT HAVE KEPT STEPHEN 
IN HIS SEAT 
HINDI HINDLEY STILL PINNED TO HIS 
CHAIR HENDRY 
THIS IS AN 
IMPLEMENT WE DO NOT SEE VERY OFTEN 
FROM THIS FAR AWAY YOU EXPECT HIM 
TO POT IT YOU STRUGGLE AT THE 
SNOOKER CLUBS AT HOME BECAUSE YOU 
HAVE GOT THE SHADE ON THE TABLE AND 
YOU CANNOT GET YOUR HEAD UNDER IT 
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME WE CAME 
HERE TO THE CRUCIBLE THERE WAS NONE 
OF THIS EQUIPMENT 
THERE WERE THE OLD HALF BUTTS WITH 
A FIFTY YEAR OLD TIP ON 
TODAY WITH ALL THE EXTENSIONS 
THERE IS NOT ONE SHOT THAT YOU 
CANNOT PLAY WITH YOU OR DON'T YOU 
YOUR OWN CUE 
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEVER THOUGHT 
OF IT 
NOT HIS INTENDED RED NOT THAT IT 
ANY DIFFERENCE EXCEPT THAT 
MADE ANY DIFFERENCE EXCEPT THAT HE'S NOT AT THE BEST ANGLE ON THE 
BROWN 
HE CERTAINLY WASN'T IN THE BEST 
POSITION TO PLAY FROM BROWN TO RED 
BUT HE STALKED THE PROBLEM SO 
EASILY SOLVE THE PROBLEM NO NO TEAM MUCH HAS APPEARED A PROBLEM TO 
RONNIE TODAY HE HAS BEEN IN 
SPARKLING FORM NO DISRESPECT TO 
STEPHEN BUT IT HAS BEEN A VIRTUOSO 
PERFORMANCE 
THAT IS THE NATURE OF THIS GAME 
WHEN THE OTHER MAN IS AT THE TABLE 
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT 
IT 
SO O'SULLIVAN CONTINUES INEXORABLY 
ON HE IS WITHIN ONE FRAME OF A 
PLACE IN THE FINAL 
I WONDER WHAT THOUGHTS ARE NOW 
BEGINNING TO SPIN THROUGH STEPHEN 
HENDRY'S MIND 
I THINK HE JUST 
WANTS THIS MATCH TO FINISH NOW 
ESPECIALLY WHEN RONNIE HAD A COUPLE 
OF A COURAGEOUS BOOKS YOU HAVE TO 
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT BECAUSE HE 
IS PLAYING SO WELL AND GETTING THE 
RUN OF THE BALL THERE IS NOTHING 
STEPHEN CAN DO ABOUT THIS FROM FROM RONNIE'S PERSPECTIVE HE IS ON AN 
ADRENALIN BUZZ 
HE IS RELENTLESS 
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD A PLAYER 
YOU'RE IF YOUR OPPONENT IS PLAYING 
LIKE THAT AND GETTING FLUKES AS 
WELL THAT IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE 
SEEN HIM GETTING ONE IN THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP NOW WE HAD TWO IN ONE 
FRAME 
IT GOES IN OFF THE YELLOW 
AND THIS 
NEXT ONE SAFETY SHOT WHERE HE WAS 
TRYING TO GET A GOOD WHITE HENDRY 
WAS ALREADY GETTING OUT OF HIS 
CHAIR THE RED HAS OBVIOUSLY CAUGHT 
THE BLUE HALF BALL AND ONCE AGAIN 
THE YELLOW HAS COME TO HIS RESCUE 
HE WENT ONTO WIN THE FRAME AT THAT 
VISIT THAT IS WHEN IT HURTS THEY THEY ARE BACK IN THE ARENA RONNIE NEEDS 
ONE MORE FOR A PLACE IN THE FINAL 
A MASTER CLASS FROM 
O'SULLIVAN BUT LET'S NOT FORGET TO 
GREATNESS OF STEPHEN HENDRY AND 
THE MANY TROUNCING AS HE HAS HANDED 
OUT IN THE PAST 
I THINK THAT SHOT TELLS US THAT 
STEPHEN IS NOT GOING TO HOLD BACK 
NOW I'M SURE HE WOULD LIKE TO GET 
IT TO THE FINAL SESSION TWO MORE 
FRAMES IN THIS SESSION STEPHEN HAS 
GOT TO WIN BOTH OF THEM OTHERWISE 
THE MATCH IS OVER 
GOT THE CANNON OF THE BUNCH THAT HE 
INTENDED BUT THE RED AT THAT HE 
ATTEMPTED COULD SO EASILY HAVE 
FINISHED IN A POTTABLE POSITION TO 
THE RIGHT MIDDLE INSTEAD OF 
ROLLING ONTO THE CUSHION 
WELL HOW HAS THAT NOT DROPPED HOW 
HAS THAT NOT GONE IN L. THOUGHT IT HAD DROPPED TWICE 
THERE IS A LOOSE RED IF HE STARTS 
THIS BLACK IN PLAIN BALL HE HAS A 
NATURAL ANGLE TO PLAY FOR THAT 
LOOSE RED HE IS ASKING FOR THE CUE 
BALL TO BE CLEANED 
MICHAELA TABB WHO HAS PERFORMED 
ADMIRABLY BUT ALL THESE HIGH SCORES 
AND BIG BREAKS GOING IN SHE HAS TO 
GIVE IT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CONCENTRATION 
SHE HAS DONE GREAT JOB 
O'SULLIVAN DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE 
HE WANTS TO PLAY PERFECTLY IN LONG SPELLS HE HAS 
THERE IS ONE LOOSE RED BUT HE HAS 
A NICE ANGLE TO GO INTO THE CLUSTER 
HE HAS BROUGHT FORTY FIVE REDS INTO PLAY 
FOUR OR FIVE REDS 
HE CAME IN THIS EVENING STEPHEN 
HENDRY WITH THAT PEOPLE GO FOR 
DEFICIT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT A 
CHAMPION IS ALL ABOUT LOOK AT HIS 
PERFORMANCE TONIGHT 
I CANNOT THINK HE HAS PLAYED ONE 
WRONG SHOT IT WOULD BE EASY TO LET 
YOUR HEAD DROP GREAT PLAYER AND GREAT CHAMPION 
HE PLAYED TWO QUALITY FRAMES TO 
REDUCE THE ARREARS TO THIRTEEN TO SIX WITH 
BIG BREAKS IN THOSE BUT THE NEXT 
THREE FRAMES O'SULLIVAN KEPT HIM 
SCORELESS 
JUST HAVING A GOOD LOOK TO SEE 
WHICH ONE OF THESE REDS HE WOULD 
LIKE TO BE ON A STRAIGHT RED BUT I 
DON'T THINK IT GOES 
I THINK THE 
MIDDLE ONE GOES BUT IS IT IN THE 
DIRECT LINE OF THE CUE BALL 
HE IS PLAYING THE MIDDLE ONE HE 
DIDN'T THINK THE OTHER ONE WENT 
ON RED HAS COVERED THE OTHER ONE 
RED WHAT WITH THE GOOD RUN THAT 
RONNIE HADDIN THE LAST FRAME AND 
THE BAD RUN THAT STEPHEN IS 
SUFFERING HERE NOTHING IS GOING 
RIGHT AT THE MOMENT NO 
HE WAS ENTITLED TO BE ON A RED WHEN 
HE POTTED THE PINK 
IT BRINGS TO YOUR MIND THAT MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN HIS LAST SHOT HE HIT IT WELL INTO THE BUNCH WELL 
BUT FATE AS WELL AS O'SULLIVAN 
WAS UNRELENTING SAID THAT TOO 
QUICKLY 
WELL RONNIE IS RENTING A QUICKLY LITTLE BIT RELENTING 
HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT AGAIN A 
LITTLE SCRATCH OF THE HEAD 
THESE TWO GREAT PLAYERS ORAM PRETTY 
GOOD TERMS NOW ON PRETTY GOOD 
TERMS NOW THEY DID GET AT ODDS A 
FEW YEARS AGO BUT EVERYTHING 
BETWEEN THEM IS FINE NOW 
I DID SOME SHOWS WITH THEM AT THE 
END OF LAST SEASON THEY ARE POLES 
OF COURSE GREAT RESPECT FOR ONE 
ANOTHER RONNIE KNOWS WHAT A GREAT 
CHAMPION STEPHEN HENDRY IS OF 
COURSE STEPHEN HAS MADE IT CLEAR 
TO EVERYBODY THAT WHEN RONNIE IS AT 
HIS BEST HE IS UNBEATABLE 
WATCHING INTENTLY ON THE RIGHT 
ADAM DUFFY VERY PROMISING YOUNG 
PLAYER WHO HAS BEEN AWARDED NEPAL 
HUNTER A SCHOLARSHIP NEPAL 
HUNTER SCHOLARSHIP THAT WILL 
ENABLE HIM TO TRAIN AT THE ACADEMY 
UP THE ROAD 
JIMMY WHITE AND I PLAYED AN 
EXHIBITION AT THE CLUB HE PLAYED IT 
AND HE CAN PLAY THERE IS EVERY 
CHANCE HE COULD BE AT THE CRUCIBLE 
AS PLAYER I'M SURE HE WILL HAVE 
LEARNT A LOT WATCHING THESE TWO 
GREAT PLAYERS THIS EVENING 
SIXTEEN TO SIX IN FRONT AND STILL 
ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM WITH THE 
SAME SERIOUSNESS AS THAT WAS THE 
OPENING FRAME 
SHOULD BE AN EASY SNOOKER THIS 
FOR STEPHEN JUST TUCK THIS CUE 
BALL IN BEHIND THE YELLOW FOUL AND A MISS FOUL AND A MISS 
IT HAS TO BE PLAYED SMUT SLOWLY 
THIS MOTHER SHOT THIS SMOTHER 
SHOT NICELY DONE 
EXQUISITE AND HE HAS PLAYED A LOT 
OF THOSE SAFETY'S TODAY IT HAS NOT 
ALL BEEN ABOUT POTTING AND BREAK 
BUILDING IT IS SAFETY SHOTS LIKE 
THAT THEY DO FORCE MISTAKES FROM 
YOUR OPPONENT AND GETS YOU IN 
ACROSS THE BALLS I AMONGST THE 
BALLS IF HE CAN JUST GET PAST THE 
BROWN HE MAY BE ABLE TO WREST THE 
CUE BALL AGAINST THE TOP CUSHION 
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE RED HE 
PLAYS MIGHT NOT IN OTHER REDS 
TOWARDS THE TOP CUSHION CERTAINLY 
NO WAY BACK TO BAULK IT APPEARS 
SO CAN HE FIND A SAFE PLACE AT 
THIS END OF THE TABLE 
I DIDN'T PINK HE COULD SEE QUITE 
ENOUGH OF IT MAYBE TRY TO BEND IT 
WITH A TRACE ASIDE THIS COULD BE 
IT 
A DESPERATE ATTEMPT AT A LONG RED 
MIGHT AS WELL AT THIS LATE STAGE 
WITH SO LITTLE FURTHER TO LOSE 
THERE IS THE HENDRY FAMILY GORDON 
ON THE RIGHT WHO IS NOT MUCH OF A 
PLAYER BUT SAID ABOUT HIS FATHER 
BOB CERTAINLY WAS HE SAID WHEN 
THERE WAS UNFORTUNATELY NO 
PROFESSIONAL GAME IN SCOTLAND HE 
NEVER SAW HIS GRANDAD PLAY 
GRANDSON HOW HE WOULD HAVE LOVED 
IT 
A FEW DELICATE LITTLE POSITIONAL 
SHOTS TO BE PLAYED JUST WATCH THE 
WAY HE MANOEUVRED THAT CUE BALL 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS BEEN A CREDIT TO 
HIMSELF AND THE GAME THIS EVENING 
MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE COME OUT AND 
THROWING CAUTION TO THE WIND FROM 
FRAME ONE 
BUT HE NEVER PLAYED ANY ROLE SHOTS 
HE TRIED HIS BEST IN EVERY FRAME 
ANY WRONG SHOT HE NEVER LET HIS 
HEAD GO DOWN HE HAS PROVED THIS 
YEAR THAT HE IS STILL A FORCE IN 
THE GAME 
I THINK THAT IS THE MAJOR THING 
THAT HENDRY WILL TAKE AWAY FROM 
THIS CHAMPIONSHIPS HE WANTED TO 
EXPERIENCE AGAIN THE FEELING OF 
BEING GENUINELY IN CONTENTION AND 
HE WAS 
UNTIL HE RAN INTO THIS GENIUS AT 
THE PEAK OF HIS FORM 
RED BLUE WILL BE ENOUGH THIS HAS 
BEEN AN OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE 
FROM RONNIE JUST THINK IT WAS A 
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS 
PLAYING STEPHEN HENDRY IN THE U. K. 
AND HE DID THE WALKOUT 
EVERYBODY QUESTIONER THEN DID HE 
HAVE THE RIGHT ATTITUDE HE HAS 
GONE IN OFF BUT SINCE THEN HE HAS 
COME BACK AND I WAS GOING TO SAY 
HE HAS PLAYED CONSISTENTLY FOR THE 
LAST COUPLE OF SEASONS BUT THAT 
WAS JUST SHEER CARELESSNESS IF HENDRY IS 
GOING 
TO LOSE HE 
WOULD SOONER LOSE SEVENTEEN TO SEVEN THAN SEVENTEEN TO SIX THE BLACK TO KEEP THE MATCH ALIVE 
WHAT A FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE FROM 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN NOT A WORD I 
USED OFTEN BUT FULLY JUSTIFIED 
HERE THIS AUTHENTIC GENIUS GAVE A 
MASTERCLASS STEPHEN HENDRY DID 
QUITE WELL WITH THE VERY FEW 
CHANCES THAT HE HAD BUT O'SULLIVAN 
WINS SEVENTEEN TO SIX HE GOES THROUGH TO THE 
FINAL 
WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE FROM RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN SPORTING FROM 
HENDRY AT THE END 
HE WAS SAYING 
RONNIE THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST 
WONDERFUL PERFORMANCES YOU DESERVE 
TO WIN 
HE IS RED HOT FAVOURITE FOR 
THE TITLE NOW SURELY 
HE PUT 
HIMSELF UNDER A BIT OF PRESSURE 
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO WIN THIS WITH 
A SESSION TO SPARE HE WANTED THE 
DAY OFF TOMORROW 
HOW BIG ADVANTAGE 
TO HAVE A DAY OFF TOMORROW MASSIVE MASSIVE IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A BIT OUT OF 
HIM HE WANTED TO WIN SO BADLY NOW 
HE HAS DONE IT HE CAN GO WINNING 
TOMORROW 
HOW WELL STEPHEN HENDRY TOMORROW REFLECT ON THIS CAMPAIGN 
HE HAS 
BEATEN SOME OF THE GREAT OPEN TO 
NEW PLAYERS HE IS STILL THERE 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT STEPHEN STEPHEN HENDRY GOES HOME RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
GOES THROUGH TO THE THIRD FINAL OF 
HIS CAREER 
THANKS TO DENNIS AND WILLIE WE 
WILL BE BACK TOMORROW
