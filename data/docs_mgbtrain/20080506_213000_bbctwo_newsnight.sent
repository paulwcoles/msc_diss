AND NOW THE DANGER OF DISEASE 
MIGHT THE BURMESE CYCLONE ALSO 
DESTROY THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT 
TONIGHT IT'S THE WORST CYCLONE TO 
HIT ASIA IN SEVENTEEN YEARS BUT THE 
DISTINGUISHING FEATURE IS THAT IT 
STRUCK A COUNTRY WHOSE GOVERNMENT 
HAS A PHOBIA ABOUT INVOLVED WITH 
THE REST OF THE WORLD CAN THE 
MILITARY GOVERNMENT THEY ALLOW THE 
REST OF THE WORLD TO HELP TO 
RELIEVE SUFFERING WITHOUT 
JEOPARDISING ITS OWN EXISTENCE HE 
SAYS HE WILL LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE 
BUT WILL BE PEOPLE LISTEN TO HIM 
THEY ARE VOTING IN THE BIGGEST OF 
THE REMAINING PRIMARIES WHY DOES 
BARACK OBAMA STRUGGLE TO WIN A 
WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTES WE'VE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT HOW HILLARY CLINTON 
HAS RECAST HERSELF AS THE PEOPLE'S 
CANDIDATE WHILE BARACK OBAMA BUT 
TROUBLESOME PRIEST INTEL IS 
STRUGGLING TO CONNECT 
AND WHAT DO 
WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT THE CLIMATE 
MODELS UPON WHICH OUR POLITICIANS 
RELY WHEN PREACHING TO US ABOUT HOW 
WE SHOULD CONDUCT GREENER LIVES 
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE DEAD FORTY ONE THOUSAND MISSING 
ONE MILLION HOMELESS THE OFFICIAL 
FIGURES FROM THE MOUTHPIECE OF THE 
MILITARY DICTATORSHIP ARE BAD 
ENOUGH THE ESTIMATES FROM THE FEW 
INDEPENDENT FOREIGN AID WORKERS IN 
THE COUNTRY ARE FAR WORSE THEY 
INCLUDE THE ESTIMATE THAT FORTY PER CENT OF 
THOSE WHO DIED ON CHILDREN THE 
UNITED NATIONS IS BEGGING THE JUNTA 
TO LIFT THE RESTRICTIONS PREVENTING 
MORE AID WORKERS FROM GETTING INTO 
THE COUNTRY GEORGE BUSH DID 
LIKEWISE MORE THAN THREE DAYS 
AFTER THE CYCLONE TOLL THROUGHOUT 
SOUTHERN BURMA BE STILL DON'T HAVE 
THE FULL PICTURE OF THE DESTRUCTION 
AND DEATH ITS COURSE IT'S CLEAR 
MOST VICTIMS WERE SIMPLY WASHED 
AWAY BY A TIDAL SURGE UP TO TWELVE F. T. 
HIGH THAT FOLLOWED WINS ON 
SATURDAY OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY M. P. H. MASSIVE 
DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY THE CYCLONE 
WAS EVIDENT THE MOMENT WE'VE 
REACHED THE OUTSKIRTS OF RANGOON 
THERE WAS BLOOD WATER EVERYWHERE IN 
THE OUTSKIRTS AND INSIDE THE CITY 
AS WELL WHOLE TREES HAD BEEN THIS 
BRUITED ALONG WITH ELECTRICITY CABLES 
CYCLONE NARGIS SWEPT CABLES THROUGH THE IRRAWADDY DELTA 
DEVASTATING BURMA'S PRINCIPAL RICE 
GROWING AREA AND MOVED ON TO THE 
COUNTRY'S MAIN CITY RANGOON ON 
THE WAY IT KILLED AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND 
IN JUST ONE TOWN BOGALAY AND HALF 
OF ANOTHER IS SAID BY M. I WITNESS 
TO HAVE COMPLETELY VANISHED 
COMMUNICATIONS ACROSS THE DELTA ARE 
SO BAD THAT MANY OF THE PLACE HAS 
AFFECTED ARE STILL INACCESSIBLE 
BUT IT'S ESTIMATED THAT UP TO ONE 
MILLION PEOPLE MAY BE HOMELESS 
MEANWHILE IN RANGOON FAMILIES HAVE 
BEEN QUEUING UP FOR DRINKING WATER 
MOST HOMES HAVE NO WATER OR 
ELECTRICITY THE SCALE OF THE 
DISASTER IS SO SERIOUS THAT IT 
PROMPTED THE GENERALS WHO RUN BURMA 
TO APPEAL FOR OUTSIDE AID THAT'S A 
MOST UNUSUAL STEP FOR A HIGHLY 
SECRETIVE GOVERNMENT THAT HAS 
SPURNED OFFERS OF HELP AFTER THE 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR TSUNAMI YET EVEN NOW THE 
GOVERNMENT ATTITUDE TO LETTING IN 
AID WORKERS AND SUPPLIES IS HIGHLY 
AMBIVALENT FOR DAYS IT HAS BEEN 
PREVARICATING OVER GIVING 
PERMISSION THE FIRST CONSIGNMENT 
OF OUTSIDE FOOD AID WAS DELIVERED 
TODAY FROM A THAI MILITARY AIRCRAFT 
ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT APPEARED TO 
HAVE NO FORKLIFT TRUCKS OR OTHER 
EQUIPMENT TO HELP UNLOAD IT THE 
REGIME HAS NOW GIVEN THE GREEN 
LIGHT FOR SUPPLIES FROM THE UN AND 
OTHER OUTSIDE AGENCIES TO GET THE 
MAIN RELIEF EFFORT MOVING BUT MOST 
AID ORGANISATIONS STILL HAVEN'T 
BEEN GIVEN VISAS TO SEND AN EXTRA 
STAFF EVEN THOUGH RELIEF WORKERS 
INSIDE BURMA CAN'T COPE 
THE SCALE 
OF THIS IS HUGE THIS IS NOT A 
SMALL LOCALISED EMERGENCY THIS IS 
AN EMERGENCY IN THE FIVE BIG 
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WITH LOTS OF 
PEOPLE AFFECTED THIS NEEDS A CO 
ORDINATED INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE L. 
THINK THE UNITED NATIONS IS THAT 
CO ORDINATING BODY YOU NEED A LOT 
OF SUPPORT FROM DONOR GOVERNMENTS 
AND ORGANISATIONS LIKE OUR OWN AND 
OTHERS IN THE U. K. WITHOUT THAT 
THERE IS NO WAY I FEEL THAT WE 
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET WHAT IS 
NEEDED ON THE GROUND AND THE RIGHT 
PLACES 
BURMA'S MILITARY RULE HAS PLACES NOW BEEN SHOWN ON STATE TELEVISION 
GETTING INVOLVED IN RELIEF EFFORTS 
BUT THEY DID LITTLE TO WARN THE 
POPULATION OF WHAT WAS COMING THEY THEY HAD AT LEAST THREE DAYS' WARNING 
FROM LAST 
WEDNESDAY IN WHICH TO 
START EVACUATING PEOPLE FROM THE 
MOST EXPOSED AREAS THEY DID 
NOTHING THEY ARE SAID TO THE 
POPULATION OF BURMA THAT THIS WAS A 
STORM WHICH WOULD AT THE MOST REACH 
FIFTY KILOMETRES PER HOUR IN FACT IT 
WAS FOUR TIMES THAT AND IT WAS THE 
WORST STORM TO HIT RANGOON SINCE 
NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN 
DESPITE THE EXTENT OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN DISASTER THE REGIME HAS INSISTED 
THAT A REFERENDUM ON THE NEW 
MILITARY BACKED CONSTITUTION A POST 
BY THE COUNTRY'S PRO DEMOCRACY 
MOVEMENT WILL GO AHEAD AS PLANNED 
THIS WEEKEND IN MOST PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY IT'S BEEN POSTPONED ONLY 
IN THE WORST AFFECTED AREAS 
MEANWHILE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGNERS 
CLAIM THE DISASTER HAS ALREADY LED 
TO KILLINGS IN A RANGOON PRISON WE WE HAVE HAD A RELIABLE REPORTS NOW 
THAT UP TO ONE HUNDRED PRISONERS WERE SHOT 
AND MAYBE THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE PRISONERS WERE 
KILLED WHEN PRISONERS IN THE MOST 
NOTORIOUS JAIL IN BURMA ESCAPED 
THE PRISONERS HAD BEEN PUT THERE 
BECAUSE OTHER PARTS OF THE JAIL HAD 
BEEN SEVERELY DAMAGED BY THE 
CYCLONE 
RARE PRO DEMOCRACY CYCLONE DEMONSTRATIONS LED BY BUDDHIST 
MONKS WERE CRUSHED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT LAST SEPTEMBER BUT 
SOMETHING THE LONG TERM ECONOMIC 
IMPACT OF THE CYCLONE WILL NOW 
EVENTUALLY FORCED THE REGIME TO 
OPEN UP MORE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
THEY'VE LOST TWO THIRDS OF THEIR 
G. D. P. THE IRRAWADDY DELTA IS THE 
RICE BOWL OF BURMA THE KEY 
COMMODITY WHICH HAS BEEN KEEPING 
THE JUNTA OR A FLOAT HAS BEEN L. N. G. 
LIQUID LIQUIFIED NATURAL GAS AND 
OIL FROM THE ANDAMAN SEA 
PRESUMABLY ALL THOSE ASSETS HAVE 
BEEN PRETTY FATALLY COMPROMISED BY 
THE RECENT CYCLONE IT'S VERY 
DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THEY'RE GOING 
TO MAKE THEIR WAY FORWARD 
ECONOMICALLY WITHOUT MASSIVE 
INTERNATIONAL AID 
FOR NOW THE 
PRIORITY IS FOR HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF BURMESE ARE MUCH 
SIMPLER TENSE AND TARPAULINS 
DRINKING WATER FOOD AND TRUCKS 
BOATS AND AIRCRAFT TO CARRY THOSE 
SUPPLIES IF THEY DON'T GET THROUGH 
QUICKLY THE DEATH TOLL WILL BE 
HIGHER STILL ANDREW KIRKWOOD IS 
SAVE THE CHILDREN'S DIRECTOR IN 
BURMA HE SPOKE TO THE EARLIER FROM 
RANGOON I ASKED HIM HOW BAD THE 
SITUATION WAS THERE 
THIS IS AN 
INCREDIBLY URGENT HUMANITARIAN NEED 
IT'S ONE THAT WILL CONTINUE FOR A 
DEER ROAM MORE THIS ISN'T 
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE OVER 
IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS A YEAR OR 
MORE IF YOU REMEMBER HOW LONG IT 
TOOK THE PEOPLE TO RECOVER FROM THE 
TSUNAMI IT WAS YEARS L. THINK 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SIMILAR 
SITUATION HERE WITH MILLIONS 
HOMELESS AND BETWEEN FIFTY AND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
PEOPLE POSSIBLY DEAD 
HOW DID THEY 
DIE 
WE EXPECT MOST OF THEM DROWNED DIE THE STORM SURGE IN MANY PARTS OF 
THE DELTA FOLLOWING THE MAJOR WIND 
WAS REPORTEDLY AS HIGH AS TWENTY FIVE F. T. IN 
PLACES THE DELTA IS A VERY FLAT 
AREA SO YOU WOULD EXPECT MANY 
PEOPLE DROWNED 
HOW MANY OF THEM DO 
YOU THINK OUR CHILDREN 
A ROUGH 
FIGURE IS ABOUT FORTY PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE 
LIVING IN THE DELTA OF CHILDREN 
UNDER EIGHTEEN ONE WOULD EXPECT THAT FORTY 
PER CENT OF THE DEAD AND MISSING OUR 
CHILDREN 
WHAT SCALE OF HELP IS CHILDREN NEEDED IN THE AREAS YOU'VE REACHED 
SO FAR 
WE ARE LOOKING ALREADY AT 
FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMELESS IN THE AREA 
THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET TO IN 
THE DELTA AREA MY UNDERSTANDING IS 
THAT IT'S COMPLETELY FLAT NINETY TO NINETY FIVE PER CENT 
OF HOMES IN THE WORST AFFECTED 
REGION HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY 
DESTROYED SOME AREAS THE 
VILLAGERS ARE COMPLETELY UNDER 
WATER STILL 
WHAT HAVE YOU 
DISTRIBUTED TO THOSE YOU CAN REACH 
TODAY SAVE THE CHILDREN 
DISTRIBUTED FOOD PLASTIC TARPAULIN 
BUT IT'S WATER PURIFICATION 
TABLETS TO THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO DO THAT IN THE COMING 
WEEKS MOST OF THE AFFECTED AREAS 
ARE ACCESSIBLE ONLY BY BOAT AT THE 
BEST OF TIMES MANY OF THE BOATS 
THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE ABLE TO 
ACCESS THE AREAS NOW WAS SUNK 
DURING THE STORM IT IS A MAJOR AND 
LOGISTICS NIGHTMARE 
WHAT IT HAS 
THE GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE BEEN SO 
FAR HAVE THEY BEEN HOSTILE TO AID 
IT'S CLEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT SEES 
THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL 
ASSISTANCE AND HAS BEEN TRYING TO 
FACILITATE OUR ASSISTANCE IT'S 
DIFFICULT TO SAY HOW THAT'S GOING 
TO PLAY OUT IN THE COMING DAYS 
PRESIDENT BUSH HAS APPEALED FOR 
THEM TO ACCEPT U. S. ASSISTANCE AFTER 
SOME OFFERS OF HELP HAVE BEEN 
REJECTED WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON 
THAT 
OF COURSE THE AMERICAN THAT GOVERNMENT AND THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF 
DIFFICULT RELATIONS SO IT'S NOT 
ENTIRELY SURPRISING TO ME THAT THEY 
WOULD BE AT ODDS ABOUT HOW TO 
DELIVER ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE IN 
THIS SITUATION 
I'M JOINED NOW BY 
THE CHIEF SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UN'S 
WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME SHE IS IN NEW 
YORK WHAT IS THE ESTIMATE OF THE 
SIZE OF NEED BUT 
IT'S GOING TO 
BE HARD TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW 
MANY PEOPLE WILL NEED AID BECAUSE 
IT SO EARLY IN THIS OPERATION WE 
THINK IT IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WE HAVE 
ASSESSMENT TEAMS FROM THE WORLD 
FOOD PROGRAMME AND OTHER UN 
ORGANISATIONS WHO ARE OUT IN THE 
FIELD TO SEE HOW MUCH IN NEED THEIR 
AREAS BUT AS YOU CAN SEE FROM ALL 
OF THE PICTURES THE DEVASTATION 
HAS BEEN ENORMOUS IN THE NEXT FEW 
HOURS WE WILL SEND OUT MORE TRUCKS 
WITH MORE RICE INTO THE OUTLYING 
AREAS BUT MANY OF THE HARDEST HIT 
AREAS ARE UNDER WATER AND 
ACCESSIBLE ONLY BY BOAT MANY BOATS 
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED IT'S A VERY 
TOUGH TASK 
IS THE AID THAT YOU ARE 
CURRENTLY DISTRIBUTING FROM 
SUPPLIERS YOU ALREADY HAVE IN THE 
COUNTRY OR HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO 
BRING ANYTHING IN 
WE HAVE BEEN 
DISTRIBUTING ON TUESDAY ALREADY THIRTY 
TONS OF RICE THAT WE HAD IN OUR 
WAREHOUSE IN YANGON NEAR THE AREA 
THAT HAS BEEN HARDEST HIT THE 
WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME HAS A LONG 
GOING AID OPERATION IN ME MYANMAR 
WE HAVE STAFF ON THE GROUND AND WE 
HAVE SUPPLIES ON THE GROUND IN 
THAT CASE THEY WERE FORTUNATE WE 
HAVE HAD CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE MADE VALUABLE 
CORPORATION BUT WE NEED MORE ACCESS 
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE CO OPERATION 
IN THE SHORT TERM 
HAVE YOU YET 
BEEN ABLE AND BEEN ALLOWED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT TO BRING IN ANY EXTRA 
SUPPLIES 
NOT YET WE ARE AGAIN IN SUPPLIES CONTACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT ALL 
OVER ASIA WE ARE CO ORDINATING AND 
GEARING UP FOR A BIG AID OPERATION 
WE ARE PLANNING TO BRING IN MORE 
SUPPLIES BUT WE ARE NOW WAITING FOR 
MORE CO OPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT 
THIS IS A HUGE NEED THAT IS ON THE 
GROUND I THINK EVERYBODY WHO HAS 
SEEN THE PICTURES REALISES THAT 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE 
IN DIRE NEED THE WORLD FOOD 
PROGRAMME HAS A LONG RECORD OF AID 
OPERATIONS ARE REALLY BEING ON THE 
GROUND AND BRINGING AID TO THE 
PEOPLE WHO NEED IT DESPERATELY WE 
ARE COMMITTED TO DOING THIS 
THEY SPENT THE LAST FEW DAYS 
PROMISING TO LISTEN AND LEARN BUT 
AS DAVID GROSSMAN REPORTS SOME OF 
THEIR COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN DOING 
RATHER A LOT OF TALKING AS WELL 
PLENTY OF LABOUR M. P.'S ARE ARGUING IN 
PRIVATE AT A GORDON BROWN NEEDS TO 
GET OFF THE BACK SEAT AND TAKE THE 
WHEEL THEY BELIEVE HE IS BEING 
DRIVEN ABOUT BY EVENTS WITHOUT 
EXPLAINING WHERE HE WANTS TO TAKE 
THE COUNTRY THE PRIME MINISTER IS 
SAYING HE IS MORE SO FAR GORDON 
BROWN'S RESPONSE TO THE CARNAGE OF 
LAST WEEK'S LOCAL ELECTIONS HAS 
BEEN TO ARGUE THAT YES LABOUR HAS 
MADE A COUPLE OF MISTAKES BUT THE 
MAIN PROBLEM THE THING THAT HAS 
REALLY FRIGHTENED VOTERS IS THE 
GLOBAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE SOMETHING 
THAT HE CAN'T BE BLAMED FOR 
HOWEVER SOME LABOUR M. P.'S THINK THAT 
THIS IS ITSELF MISTAKE AFTER ALL 
HOW TO ARGUE THAT THE PROBLEM IS 
BEYOND YOUR CONTROL BUT THAT YOU 
HAVE THE SOLUTION JOHN CRADDOCK 
STOOD FOR LABOUR DEPUTY LEADERSHIP 
LAST SUMMER AND DREW LOT OF 
SUPPORT FROM GRASSROOTS MEMBERS AND 
FROM THE UNIONS HE SAYS THE PARTY 
NOW NEEDS TO TAKE STOCK NOT RUSH 
OUT NEW POLICIES 
THE SOLUTION IS 
NOT JUST A DAILY DOSE OF MORE AND 
MORE POLICIES BECAUSE THAT JUST 
COMES ACROSS AS A WHITE NOISE TO 
THE ELECTORATE WE NEED TO ANALYSE 
HOW TO REBUILD OUR COALITION AND 
HOW TO COMPREHEND WHAT IS MODERN 
CONSERVATISM AND HAD TO TAKE IT ON 
THERE IS NO HONOUR OFF SWITCH 
THERE IS A DANGER THAT THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY WILL GRAB HIS 
ZEITGEIST IF YOU LIKE ON OFF 
SWITCH WE HAVE TO ANALYSE 
EVERYTHING AND COME UP WITH SOME 
MORE DEFINITIVE STATEMENTS FOR THE 
SOCIETY WE WANT TO CREATE IS IS GORDON BROWN CAPABLE OF LEADING YOU 
THROUGH THIS 
YES I THINK HE IS 
BUT THESE ARE BIG PROFOUND SHIFTS 
THAT OPERATING AROUND US NOW 
YESTERDAY THE LABOUR LEADER IN 
SCOTLAND WENDY ALEXANDER STOOD 
PARTY POLICY ON ITS HEAD AND SAID 
SHE MAY NOW PUSH FOR REFERENDUM 
ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE IN ORDER 
SHE SAYS TO DECIDE THE ISSUE ONCE 
AND FOR ALL SHE REFUSED TO SAY 
WHETHER SHE HAD CLEARED HIS POLICY 
WITH GORDON BROWN FIRST 
THERE HAVE BEEN CLOSE DISCUSSIONS 
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME I HAVE 
NO DESIRE TO REVEAL ANY OF THEM 
FURTHER HERE L. READ IN THE PRESS 
THAT HE BOUNCED ME I BOUNCED HIM 
I SIMPLY REFER YOU TO THE FACT THAT 
THE LABOUR PARTY IN THE SCOTTISH 
PARLIAMENT BELIEVES IT IS 
UNACCEPTABLE TO LEAVE THIS ISSUE 
UNADDRESSED THROUGH THIS PARLIAMENT 
AND INTO THE NEXT PARLIAMENT 
I THINK THE IDEA THAT WENDY 
ALEXANDER YOU KNOW PLOUGHED THIS 
FURROW ON HER OWN INITIATIVE 
WITHOUT CHECKING OUT IF HER 
LIFELONG MENTOR THOUGHT IT WAS 
GREAT IDEA STRETCHES CREDIBILITY TO 
THE LIMIT L. HAVE TO WAS MYSELF 
WHY DID THIS COME OUT ON THE MONDAY 
AFTER CATASTROPHIC LOCAL ELECTION 
RESULTS FOR THE LABOUR PARTY THE 
BROWN PREMIERSHIP IS THAT IT'S AN 
IDEA IS IT JUST ANOTHER 
DIVERSIONARY TACTIC IS IT JUST 
ANOTHER WEEKEND IDEA TO BE ON THE 
FRONT FOOT BECAUSE IF IT IS THEN 
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS 
INITIATIVE IS FOR TOO SERIOUS FOR 
THAT KIND OF SHORT TERMISM AND AND THERE ARE WORRIES BEING VOICED FROM 
OTHER PARTS OF THE PARTY AS WELL 
THE FORMER HOME SECRETARY CHARLES 
CLARKE WAS ALWAYS VERY CLOSE TO 
TONY BLAIR HE HAS NOW BECOME 
INCREASINGLY CRITICAL OF THE STYLE 
AND DIRECTION OF GORDON BROWN'S 
LEADERSHIP IN A NAUTICAL TODAY HE 
OUTLINES WHAT HE THINKS THE P. M. 
NEEDS TO DO AS A MATTER OF URGENCY 
FOR A START TO SOLVE THE 
PROBLEMS ARISING FROM THE ABOLITION 
OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE 
HE SUGGESTS A MINI BUDGET TO 
SUGGEST A CLEAR SENSE OF ECONOMIC 
DIRECTION HE WANTS TO ABANDON 
PROPOSALS TO INCREASE PRE CHARGED 
ATTENTION TO FORTY TWO DAYS HE ALSO 
WANTS 
THERE WAS A NEW DEVELOPMENT TODAY 
ON ONE OF THOSE ISSUES CLEARING UP 
THE PROBLEMS FROM ABOLISHING THE 
TEN P. TAX RATE ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO 
NEW DETAIL THE TWO NEW M. P.'S WHO 
HAVE BEEN THE UNOFFICIAL 
REPRESENTATIVES OF BACKBENCH LABOUR 
DISQUIET TODAY MET THE CHANCELLOR 
THEY SAID THEY WERE REASSURED THE THE IMPORTANT THING WAS TO GET A BITTER 
POLITICAL WILL FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
TO PUT IT RIGHT WE UNDERSTAND THEY 
CANNOT PUT IT RIGHT THIS WEEK BUT 
FRANK AND I PRESSED THE CHANCELLOR 
ON THAT MATTER WAS TO GET A 
POLITICAL WILL 
WHY IS CREWE 
IMPORTANT IT IS WHERE THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE CHALLENGING 
LABOUR IN A BY ELECTION WHICH TAKES 
PLACE IN JUST OVER TWO WEEKS' TIME 
TODAY THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER WAS 
OUT CAMPAIGNING IN CREWE PROMISING 
TO MAKE THE TEN P. TAX RATE CENTRAL TO 
HIS PARTY'S BID FOR VOTES LABOUR 
HAS FACED PROBLEMS BEFORE BUT 
NEVER AT A TIME WHEN THE OPPOSITION 
IS FEELING AND LOOKING SO ENERGISED 
AND CONFIDENT WE ARE JOINED NOW 
FROM WESTMINSTER BY HAZEL BLEARS 
THE COMMUNITY SECRETARY DID YOU 
KNOW THAT YOUR LEADER IN SCOTLAND 
WAS ABOUT TO ADVOCATE A PHOTON THE 
BREAK UP OF THE UNION 
NO I WAS 
NOT PARTY TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT 
AS YOU HAVE HEARD FROM WENDY 
ALEXANDER TODAY SHE IS NOT AFRAID 
OF THE VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE AND AS 
FAR AS SHE IS CONCERNED THIS 
MATTER GOING ON AND ON IS A 
DISTRACTION SO IF THERE IS TO BE A 
REFERENDUM IN HER VIEW GET ON 
WITH IT WE WILL BE OPPOSED TO IT 
AND WE WILL RELISH THAT FIGHT DOES DOES THE CABINET AGREE WITH HER DECISION 
TO CALL FOR A VOTE 
THIS IS A 
MATTER FOR THE LABOUR PARTY TO 
TAKE THAT VIEW IN SCOTLAND IT IT IS NOT A MATTER FOR THE ENGLISH 
LABOUR PARTY 
I THINK THIS IS A 
MATTER FOR WENDY ALEXANDER WHO HAS 
MADE HER A FEW CLEAR AS THE LEADER 
OF THE LABOUR PARTY IN SCOTLAND 
THAT IF ALEX SALMOND IS GOING TO 
BANG ON ABOUT HAVING A REFERENDUM 
THEN HE SHOULD PUT HIS MONEY WHERE 
HIS MOUTH IS AND HAVE THAT VOTE 
WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF THE ARGUMENT 
WITH THE PEOPLE WE BELIEVE THAT 
THE UNION IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS 
OF THIS COUNTRY 
TO BE CLEAR THE 
CABINET DOES AGREE WITH HER 
DECISION TO CALL FOR AN EARLY VOTE 
IN SCOTLAND 
YES THAT IS WHAT SHE 
HAS DECIDED TO DO 
WE KNOW WHAT SHE 
HAS DECIDED I AM ASKING AND YOU 
HAVE ALSO TOLD US YOU DO NOT AGREE 
WITH US WHAT DOES THE CABINET 
THINK 
NO WHAT 
I HAVE SAID IS THAT THINK I AGREE WITH WENDY ALEXANDER IN 
TERMS OF SAYING THAT IF ALEX 
SALMOND IS GOING TO BANG ON ABOUT 
HAVING A REFERENDUM THEN HE NEEDS 
TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO PUT THAT TO 
PEOPLE 
SO THE CABINET AGREES WITH PEOPLE THIS 
INDEED THAT IS THE POSITION THIS WE HAVE GOT WE ARE NOT AFRAID TO 
HAVE A POLITICAL ARGUMENT WITH OUR 
OPPONENTS WHETHER IT'S ABOUT THE 
REFERENDUM IN SCOTLAND OR WHETHER 
IT IS THE TORIES IN NANTWICH 
I PUT 
IT TO YOU THAT IT IS YET MORE 
EVIDENCE OF A CATASTROPHIC LACK OF 
AUTHORITY ON THE PART OF THE PRIME 
MINISTER WHICH IS WHY FIFTY FIVE PER CENT OF 
LABOUR VOTERS WE SHALL LEARN 
TOMORROW THINK HE SHOULD GO WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU JEREMY IS THAT 
I THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY THE RESULTS 
FROM LAST WEEK WERE REALLY REALLY 
BAD FOR US WE GOT A DRUBBING WE 
HAVE GOT TO LEARN THE LESSONS AND 
ACT ON THE ISSUES THAT TOUR OF REAL 
CONCERN TO PEOPLE AND IF YOU HAD 
BEEN AT THE CABINET THIS MORNING 
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN AN ABSOLUTELY 
GRITTY DETERMINATION FROM EVERY 
SINGLE MEMBER AROUND THAT TABLE TO 
GET BACK ON THE ISSUES THAT ARE 
CONCERNING PEOPLE AND THAT HIS 
FAMILY FINANCES IT'S THEIR BUDGETS 
THE COST OF LIVING THE HOUSING 
MARKET AND A DRESSING ALL OF OUR 
FOCUS TO THOSE IS THE ONLY PRIORITY 
A YOUR LEADER IS A LOSER ISN'T HE 
I DON'T ACCEPT THAT AT ALL FOR TEN 
YEARS GORDON BROWN HAS STEERED THE 
ECONOMY THROUGH SOME PRETTY CHOPPY 
WATERS WE HAVE HAD PEOPLE TALKING 
ABOUT RECESSION AND WITH THE 
ECONOMY GO OFF COURSE IT DIDN'T 
BECAUSE HE HAD THE COURAGE AND 
DETERMINATION TO TAKE SOME PRETTY 
TOUGH DECISIONS 
WHY HAS HE LED 
YOUR PARTY TO ITS WORST POSITION 
SINCE THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
WELL I 
DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND 
SINCE THE FIRST WORLD WAR BUT I 
HAVE BEEN IN THE LABOUR PARTY SINCE 
NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AND I HAVE SEEN SOME PRETTY 
TOUGH TIMES WE WERE OUT OF POWER 
FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS WE HAVE NOW HAD THREE 
ELECTION VICTORIES A FANTASTIC 
ACHIEVEMENT 
AND RIGHT NOW YOU ACHIEVEMENT HAVE GOT THE LOWEST SHARE OF THE 
VOTE YOU HAVE HAD SINCE THE FIRST 
WORLD WAR 
AND I THINK THERE ARE A 
NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THAT JEREMY 
OBVIOUSLY THE ECONOMIC BACKGROUND 
IS VERY DIFFICULT NOT JUST FOR 
BRITAIN BUT FOR A WHOLE SERIES OF 
COUNTRIES 
IN THAT CASE YOU CAN'T COUNTRIES DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
I DO NOT 
ACCEPT THAT I THINK THERE ARE 
MEASURES WE CAN TAKE AND THAT'S 
WHY WE NEED TO SEE WHAT PACKAGE WE 
CAN PUT TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE 
CONCERNS AROUND THE TEN P. TAX RATE 
WE HAVE HEARD FROM FRANK THAT THEY 
HAVE BEEN IN TO SEE THE 
CHANCELLOR 
WILL ALL OF THAT CHANCELLOR STUFF SURROUNDING THE TEN P. SHAMBLES 
BE BACKDATED 
WELL YOU HAVE HEARD 
THAT FRANK FIELD IS REASSURED 
YOU ARE IN THE CABINET YOU 
PRESUMABLY NO ONE HAS BEEN DECIDED 
I KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE 
DETERMINATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST OUT WILL BE 
PUT IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION AND 
I THINK IF YOU 
ALL OF THEM IF IF YOU HAVE TO SATISFY WAIT 
MINUTE JEREMY IF YOU HAVE TO 
SATISFY FRANK FIELD AND HIS 
COLLEAGUE THAT IS A PRETTY TOUGH 
TEST WE WILL DO OUR ABSOLUTE 
UTMOST FRANK FIELD TO MAKE SURE 
THAT 
YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING THE THAT QUESTION 
A YOU MAY WELL FIND THAT QUESTION ONE PERSON ON YOUR SEARCHES WHO 
PERHAPS HAS NOT BEEN AND THEN YOU 
WILL SAY TO ME 
ONE TWO OR MAYBE 
EVEN ONE HUNDRED BUT IN PRINCIPLE YOU ARE 
COMMITTED TO COMPENSATING ALL I I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO OUR 
ABSOLUTE AT MOST FRANK FIELD HAS 
NOW SAID THAT HE CAN FACE THE 
VOTERS IN CREWE AND NANTWICH AND I 
THINK IF WE HAVE SATISFIED FRANK 
AND THOSE VOTERS BECAUSE THAT IS 
THE IMPORTANT THING THE MEDIA 
WOULD LIKE TO WRITE THE SCRIPT THAT 
THE LABOUR PARTY HAS RUN OUT OF 
STEAM I AM NOT PREPARED TO HAVE 
THAT HAPPEN BASICALLY THE FIGHT 
IS ON IN POLITICS THE TORIES WILL 
INCREASE SCRUTINY AND THAT'S A 
GOOD THING BORIS JOHNSON WILL BE 
UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY THE 
TORIES WILL BE UNDER INCREASED 
SCRUTINY IT IS BACK TO POLITICS 
IN THE REAL WORLD AND WE HAVE GOT 
TO TAKE ON THAT FLIGHT 
JOLLY NICE 
OF YOU TO JOIN US IN LESS THAN TWO 
HOURS THE POLLING STATIONS IN THE 
LATEST PRIMARIES IN AMERICA WILL BE 
SHUTTING THEIR DOORS 
BOTH CANDIDATES WILL FIGHT TO TAKE 
ON JOHN MCCAIN HE IS ENJOYING THE 
SPECTACLE I WILL BE TALKING TO ONE 
OF THE MOST SENIOR POLITICIANS IN 
AMERICA IN A MINUTE BUT FIRST 
PETER MARSHALL IS IN WASHINGTON 
BARACK OBAMA HAS BEEN LEADING IN 
NORTH CAROLINA A SUDDEN TYPE A 
SOUTHERN STATE WITH LARGE BLACK 
VOTE HILLARY CLINTON SEEMS TO BE 
AHEAD IN INDIANA A NORTHERN 
MIDWEST STATE SHE SAYS TONIGHT 
COULD BE THE GAME CHANGED HER 
GAME CHANGER 
BREAKFAST 
GAME CHANGER BREAKFAST IN GREENWOOD INDIANA BARACK OBAMA IS 
TRYING TO SHOW THAT HE IS JUST LIKE 
THEM THE VOTERS THE PEOPLE IN THE 
AMERICAN HEARTLAND ARE INCREASINGLY 
HARD UP THE CANDIDATES HAVE TO 
KNOW THAT 
WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THE 
ISSUES IN THIS CAMPAIGN WE ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT GAS PRICES WE NEED 
LONG TERM RELIEF NOT JUST 
WASHINGTON GIMMICKS THE LATEST 
GIMMICK HE MEANS IS HILLARY 
CLINTON'S ELECTION PUMP PRIMER A 
GAS TAX HOLLIS HOLIDAY LET'S LET'S GIVE YOU A BREAK THIS SUMMER FOR 
THE AVERAGE PERSON ABOUT SEVENTY DOLLARS FOR 
PEOPLE WHO DRIVE LONGER WHICH IS A 
LOT OF FOLKS IN THIS ECONOMY IT 
COULD BE HUNDREDS WE KNOW THAT 
TRUCKERS WOULD SAVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN 
FUEL COSTS THAT IN TURN WOULD BE 
A WAY TO KEEP THE GROCERY BILLS 
FROM GETTING SO HIGH PART OF THE 
REASONS THEY ARE GOING UP IS 
BECAUSE EVERYTHING GETS A CUT IN 
AND YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE EXTRA 
FUEL COSTS TRUCKED IN 
IT IS 
TOUGH TO FIND DIFFERENCES WITH AN 
OPPONENT IN YOUR PARTY SHE HAS 
SAID THIS IS ABOUT HIM LISTENING 
TO ECONOMISTS 
IT IS POPULISM 
ISN'T IT 
YES I COULD SAY A WORSE 
WORD THAN THAT BUT IT IS APPEALING 
FOR WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR THAT 
IS OFTEN HOW YOU WIN ELECTIONS IN 
THIS COUNTRY OR ANY OTHER SO SO HILLARY CLINTON IS THE BLUE COLLAR 
CANDIDATE WHILE BARACK OBAMA FINDS 
HIMSELF CAST AS AN ELITIST 
EXTRAORDINARY WHEN YOU CONSIDER 
THAT OVER TWO DECADES HILLARY 
CLINTON LIVED IN A GOVERNOR'S 
MANSION OR THE WHITE HOUSE WHILE 
BARACK OBAMA WAS RAISED BY A SINGLE 
MOTHER ON FOOD STAMPS IN THE PAST 
YEAR THE CLINTONS HAVE RAISED ONE HUNDRED EIGHT DOLLARS 
MILLION WHILE BARACK OBAMA HAS 
BEEN PAYING OFF STUDENT LOANS IN 
THE PAST TEN YEARS BUT BARACK 
OBAMA'S PASTOR HAS BEEN A PROBLEM 
THE REVEREND JEREMIAH WRITE A RE 
EMERGED TO SUGGEST THAT BARACK 
OBAMA HAS DISTANCED HIMSELF FOR 
ONLY ONE REASON 
POLITICIANS SAY 
WHAT THEY DAY SAY WHAT THEY SAY 
AND DO WHAT THEY DO BASED ON SOUND 
BITES BASED ON POLES PREACHERS 
SAY WHAT THEY SAY BECAUSE THEY ARE 
PASSEDS THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT 
PERSON TO WHOM THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE 
BARACK OBAMA HAS FINALLY AND 
BELATEDLY DISAVOWED THE PROP THE 
TROUBLESOME PRIEST 
THE THINGS HE 
SAID LADY INTO A LOT OF THE FEARS 
LAID INTO A LOT OF THE FEARS OF 
QUITE A FEW AMERICANS WHITE 
AMERICANS IN PARTICULAR IT WAS 
INCREDIBLY DAMAGING BECAUSE IT 
RAISES QUESTIONS WAIT A MINUTE 
THIS GUY'S BEEN TALKING UNITY 
BRINGING US TOGETHER AND YET HE 
SAT IN THE PEWS FOR TWENTY YEARS WITH 
THIS GUY WHO IS DOING A LOT OF 
THINGS ABOUT AMERICA THAT I AM NOT 
COMFORTABLE WITH SPEWING 
A IF 
BARACK OBAMA WON BOTH OF THE 
PRIMARIES TODAY HE WOULD HAVE THE 
NOMINATION SEWN UP IT LOOKS MORE 
LIKELY THAT CLINTON WILL TAKE 
INDIANA AND RUN HIM CLOSE IN 
CAROLINA SHE WILL THEN APPEAL TO 
THE SUPER DELICATE THAT SHE HAS THE 
MOMENTUM SUPER DELEGATES TODAY 
SHE SAID SHE WOULD EVEN PRESS FOR A 
RULES CHANGED TO ALLOW VOTES FROM 
STATES THAT THE PARTY HAD DEEMED 
VOID WHERE BARACK OBAMA DID NOT 
RUN 
IN JUNE WE ARE GOING 
TO HAVE RUN TO RESOLVE FLORIDA AND MICHIGAN IF 
WE HAVE NOT DONE IT ALREADY THEY 
WERE LEGITIMATE ELECTIONS PEOPLE 
CAME OUT AND VOTED IF YOU COUNT 
THEM I AM AHEAD IN THE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE VOTED 
IF THAT 
HAPPENS AND BARACK OBAMA IS DENIED 
THE DEMOCRATS RISK ALIENATING THEIR 
MOST RELIABLE CONSTITUENTS BLACK 
VOTERS AND THIS AFTER WHAT WAS 
SUPPOSED TO BE OPPOSED RACIAL 
CAMPAIGN CAMPAIGN I AM JOINED BY A SUPER DELEGATE 
POST RACIAL CAMPAIGN ISN'T IT 
STRANGE THAT A MAN CAN BE AHEAD ON 
DELEGATES AND BE SEEN AS 
BELEAGUERED 
IT DEPENDS HOW YOU BELEAGUERED CATEGORISE IF YOU BASE MOST OF 
YOUR DECISION MAKING ON WHAT HIS 
FORMER PASTOR MAY HAVE SAID YOU 
WILL GET ONE FEELING ABOUT HIM IF 
YOU TALK ABOUT HOW HE HAS BEEN CAST 
AS AN ELITIST YOU MAY GET ANOTHER 
FEELING THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS 
WE KNOW THAT THESE DISTRACTIONS 
HAVE COME INTO THIS CAMPAIGN AND I 
HAVE BEEN BOTHERED BY THEM L. L. THINK 
THEY HAVE RACIAL OVERTONES THAT 
OUGHT NOT TO BE IN THIS CAMPAIGN 
MANY OF US REGRET THAT L. DON'T 
KNOW WHAT THE REVEREND'S MOTIVES 
WERE BUT IT DID NOT BODE WELL FOR 
SENATOR OBAMA AND IT DID NOT BODE 
WELL FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN OFFICE 
HOLDERS ANYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY 
WHY IS IT THAT SENATOR OBAMA HAS 
FOUND IT SO HARD TO TAKE SOME OF 
THESE KEY STATES TEXAS CALIFORNIA 
A OHIO AND THE LIKE 
REMEMBER YOU 
HAVE TWO DEMOCRATS RUNNING AGAINST 
EACH OTHER THE CHOICE IS MADE 
BETWEEN THEM AND WE OUGHT NOT TO 
PUT ANY REAL MEANING DO ON THESE 
RESULTS AS TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN 
NOVEMBER THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS 
THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE DEMOCRAT IN 
NOVEMBER WHEN YOU HAVE GOT AS 
PEOPLE SAY TWO GOOD CANDIDATES 
AND PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE UP THEIR 
MINDS BETWEEN THEM JUST BECAUSE 
THEY COME DOWN ON THE SIDE OF ONE 
OR THE OTHER DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE 
REJECTING THE OTHER THEY WILL BE 
COMING HOME TO THIS PARTY FOR THE 
ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER 
WHAT DO YOU 
IMAGINE WILL BE THE REACTION OF THE 
BLACK AMERICAN COMMUNITY IF SUCH A 
THING EXISTS IF BARACK OBAMA WERE 
NOT TO GET THE NOMINATION IT ALL 
DEPENDS ON HOW THAT PLAYS OUT I I HAVE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS 
LONG AS THE PROCESS IS TRANSPARENT 
AND PERCEIVED AS BEING FAIR THEN 
THERE IS A SCENARIO UNDER WHICH HE 
COULD NOT GET THE NOMINATION AND 
NOT HAVE ANY ANIMOSITY FROM THE 
AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY BUT IF 
IT'S PERCEIVED THAT YOUNG VOTERS 
AND AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS WERE 
HAVING THEIR EFFORTS NULLIFIED BY 
THE SO CALLED SUPER DELEGATES THAT 
IS ANOTHER PROBLEM IT DEPENDS HOW 
THE PROCESS WORKS OUT AS TO WHAT 
THE REACTION WILL BE ON THE PART OF 
AFRICAN AMERICANS 
AND WHEN DO AFRICAN AMERICANS PEOPLE LIKE YOU THE SUPER 
DELEGATES FINALLY MAKE UP THEIR 
MINDS I KNOW A FEW HAVE BUT YOU 
HAVEN'T 
WHEN WILL YOU WHEN THE 
PROCESS IS OVER L. WILL NOT BE 
MAKING ANY STATEMENTS ABOUT THAT 
UNTIL AFTER JUNE THIRD AFTER THAT 
WHEN EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SETTLED A 
NUMBER OF LAST WILL MAKE OUR 
POSITIONS KNOWN A NUMBER OF US 
PRESUMABLY YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO 
GO RIGHT ON INTO THE CONVENTION 
WITH ALL THE TIME THAT GIVES JOHN 
MCCAIN TO GET ON WITH MAKING HAY 
ABSOLUTELY NOT L. WOULD HOPE THAT 
WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF JUNE THIRD ALL 
OF THIS WILL GET SETTLED AND WE 
WILL HAVE A PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE 
WHEN WE GET TO DENVER IN AUGUST I 
BELIEVE THAT I BELIEVE IS WHAT 
IS GOING TO HAPPEN L. SAY 
PRESUMPTIVE BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS 
WHAT INTERVENING CIRCUMSTANCES MAY 
OCCUR DURING THE MONTH OF JULY AND 
THE FIRST AUGUST ANYTHING COULD 
OCCUR THAT WILL TURN THE RESULTS 
AROUND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHO IS IN 
FIRST PLACE AT THE BEGINNING VERY VERY QUICKLY AS WE ARE IN THE REALM OF 
PRESUMPTIONS GIVE US A NAME WHAT 
IS YOUR PRESUMPTION AS TO WHO IT 
WILL BE 
TODAY I THINK THERE WILL 
BE A SPLIT DECISION SENATOR OBAMA 
WILL PROBABLY WIN NORTH CAROLINA 
IT WILL BE A CLOSE CONTEST L. THINK 
SENATOR CLINTON WILL WIN IN INDIANA 
AND THEN WE WILL GO FORWARD FROM 
THERE 
THANK YOU FOR SPARING THE THERE TIME TO JOIN US 
THANK YOU FOR 
HAVING ME 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME HOW 
RELIABLE ARE THE CLIMATE CHANGE 
MODELS WHICH PREDICT CHANGES IN THE 
EARTH'S TEMPERATURE BEFORE THAT 
ROUND UP OF TODAY'S NEWS 
THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES SAY THAT 
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED BY 
THE CYCLONE WHICH STRUCK BURMA ON 
MONDAY FORTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE MISSING 
THE UNITED NATIONS HAS URGED THE 
GOVERNMENT TO LIFT VISA 
REQUIREMENTS SO MORE AID WORKERS 
CAN ENTER THE COUNTRY 
A GUNMAN INVOLVED IN A SHOOT OUT 
WITH POLICE IN SOUTH WEST LONDON 
HAS BEEN SHOT DEAD TELL US WHAT 
HAPPENED BEN 
IT WAS JUST BEFORE 
THE EVENING RUSH HOUR WHEN THE 
POLICE WERE CALLED TO CHELSEA IN 
WEST LONDON THERE WERE REPORTS OF 
A GUNMAN FIRING FROM A HOUSE AT 
THAT POINT THE POLICE RETURNED 
FIRE POLICE CAME BY 
THERE WAS A STAND OFF THE GUNMEN 
OPENED FIRE AGAIN AND FIRE WAS 
RETURNED AN HOUR LATER HE OPENED 
FIRE AND FIRE WAS RETURNED AGAIN 
WE UNDERSTAND THE GUNMAN WAS KILLED 
THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS 
COMMISSION HAS LAUNCHED AN 
INVESTIGATION WHICH IS ROUTINE 
WHEN ARMED POLICE USE GUNS OR WHEN 
SOMEONE IS KILLED BY THE POLICE IT 
WILL LOOK INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
SURROUNDING THAT FOR THAT REASON 
THE POLICE ARE NOT COMMENTING AT 
THE MOMENT THE GUNMEN'S MOTIVES 
REMAIN A MYSTERY BUT ON THREE 
SEPARATE OCCASIONS HE OPENED FIRE 
ON ARMED POLICE SOME WILL 
SPECULATE AS TO WHETHER HE WAS 
ATTEMPTING TO PROVOKE SOME KIND OF 
REACTION PERHAPS A LETHAL REACTION 
FROM THE POLICE THAT IS A QUESTION 
FOR THE IPCC INVESTIGATION I. P. C. 
AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE POSTAL 
SERVICE HAS FOUND THAT OPENING UP 
THE MARKET TO COMPETITION HAS SEEN 
NO SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT FOR 
CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES THE 
REVIEW PANEL SAID ROYAL MAIL'S 
FINANCIAL SECURITY IS UNDER 
SUBSTANTIAL THREAT AND THE CURRENT 
POSTAL SYSTEM IS UNSUSTAINABLE 
RESEARCH TO BE PUBLISHED TOMORROW 
WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE GROSSLY 
UNDERESTIMATED THE RISK TO THIS 
COUNTRY FROM FLOODS BUT PRECISELY 
HOW MUCH WORSE WILL CLIMATIC 
CONDITIONS GET SCIENTISTS STUDYING 
GLOBAL WARMING MOSTLY AGREE THAT 
TEMPERATURES ARE LIKELY TO RISE BY 
A COUPLE OF DEGREES CELSIUS TO BE 
MORE ACCURATE THEY SAY THEY NEED 
ONE THOUSAND TIMES MORE COMPUTING POWER 
THEY SAY THEY WOULD WOULDN'T THEY 
IT WOULD BE CHEAPER TO PREDICT 
USING EXPENSIVE COMPUTERS IF WE 
NEED A NEW THAMES BARRIER THAN IT 
WOULD TO BUILD A BARRIER ITSELF 
PLANET EARTH THE MOST COMPLEX 
SYSTEM WE KNOW OR DON'T KNOW SO 
MANY FACTORS AFFECT OUR CLIMATE 
OUR PROXIMITY TO THE SUN THE 
EARTH'S TILT THE CARBON CYCLE 
INVOLVING PLANTS AND THE OCEANS 
CLOUDS THE WINDS THE CURRENTS 
AND NOW OUR GREENHOUSE GASES 
WHICH MOST SCIENTISTS AGREE WILL 
CONTINUE TO HEAT THE WORLD THE MET 
OFFICE HADLEY CENTRE IN EXETER USES 
COMPUTER MODELS TO PREDICT HOW THE 
NATURAL WORLD WILL PREDICT TO ANY 
MAN MADE WARMING THE MODELS HERE 
HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY 
SOPHISTICATED OVER THE YEARS BACK BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE MODELS WE HAD 
JUST CONCLUDED THE ATMOSPHERE 
RAINFALL AND THE AMOUNT OF CARBON 
DIOXIDE BEING EMITTED INTO THE 
ATMOSPHERE BY THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES WE 
HAD CLOUDS LAND SURFACE AND ICE 
BY NINETEEN NINETY A SIMPLE OCEAN BY THE 
MID NINETIES WHICH ALSO INCLUDED 
SULPHATE AEROSOLS AND VOLCANIC 
ERUPTIONS WE ALSO INCLUDED BY 
TWO THOUSAND ONE WE HAD MORE COMPLEX PROCESSES 
IN THE OCEAN AND BETTER 
REPRESENTATION OF CLOUDS NOW WE 
ARE ABLE TO INCLUDE CHEMISTRY AND 
THE FEEDBACKS OF THE CARBON CYCLE 
SO WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR 
THE CLIMATE WELL ALL OF THE 
MODELS EVEN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE 
FORETELL OF WARMING ALL OF THE 
MODELS EXCEPT THE MOST CONSERVATIVE 
FORETELL A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS 
WARMING THAT'S WHAT HAS CREATED 
THE NEW POLITICAL URGENCY OVER 
CLIMATE CHANGE BUT FOR ALL THEIR 
STRENGTHS THE MODELS ARE STILL 
WORK IN PROGRESS SO WHAT DO THEY 
SHOW IF WE DOUBLE C. O. TWO HOW WHAT 
WOULD IT BE 
THE IPCC'S MOST CONSERVATIVE MODEL 
SUGGESTS ALMOST TWO DEGREES OF 
WARMING THE TOP END ASSUMES 
WARMING OF MORE THAN SEVEN DEGREES 
MOST MODELS CLUSTER AROUND A RISE 
OF ABOUT THREE DEGREES THIS COULD 
LEAD TO ONE BILLION PEOPLE THIRSTY 
WIDESPREAD DEATH OF CORAL A THIRD 
OF SPECIES FACING EXTINCTION AND 
MASSIVE MELTING BUT IT'S COMPLEX 
PLANET SCIENTISTS ARE STRIVING TO 
UNDERSTAND THESE ARE PICTURES FROM 
NASA BUT NOT HIS SATELLITE IMAGE 
A COMPUTER ANIMATION INSTEAD RUN 
AT HIGH RESOLUTION FOR SHORT 
TIMESPAN HAD SERIOUS COST 
PROJECTING EVEN HOW HURRICANES 
WOULD FORM IN A WARMER WORLD AT 
SERIOUS COST AT READING UNIVERSITY 
THEY ARE COLLABORATING ON A LONG 
TERM CLIMATE MODEL UNLIKE THE NASA 
MODEL THIS PREDICTS CHANGES OVER 
DECADES THE LOW MARK IS THE SON 
INCREASED COMPUTING POWER SHOULD 
MEAN MORE ACCURATE FORECASTING 
THE YELLOW MARK HIS THE SON IS 
THE SON READING ARE INSTALLING 
MULTI MILLION POUND COMPUTER 
MONSTER I. B. M.'S THAMES BLUE HOW DO 
YOU 
FEEL IN THE COMPUTER ROOM I I FEEL EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE SUCH A POWERFUL MACHINE 
THIS BEAST DOES TWENTY MILLION MILLION 
CALCULATIONS PER SECOND IT IS LIKE 
HAVING THOUSANDS OF P. C.'S AND IT'S 
RAISING NEW POSSIBILITIES 
WE CAN 
NOW MODEL OF THE WEATHER IF YOU 
THINK OF THE WORLD OF DIGITAL 
CAMERAS WE HAVE LOW MEGAPIXEL TYPE 
OF CAMERAS WITH BIG SUPERCOMPUTERS 
WE CAN LOOK AT THE CLIMATE WITH A 
HIGH MEGAPIXEL TYPE OF CAMERA IT 
IS EXCITING BECAUSE WE CAN 
CALCULATE THE PROBABILITY OF A 
STORM LIKE HURRICANE KATRINA 
HITTING A PARTICULAR PLACE HOW 
MANY TIMES IN A CENTURY WE CAN 
START ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS BUT BUT TO UNDERSTAND THE FUTURE CLIMATE 
BUT COMPUTER POWER IS NOT ENOUGH 
THE COMPUTER IS SLAYED TO ITS 
MASTERS KNOWLEDGE SOME OF OUR 
KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARTH'S SYSTEMS IS 
SOLID SOME IS MORE FLIMSY SLAVE 
TO ITS MASTERS KNOWLEDGE HIGH 
LEVEL CLOUD TENDS TO TRAPPING MORE 
HEAT RADIATING OUT FROM THE EARTH 
THE BIG QUESTION IS WHAT SORT OF 
CLOUDS WILL PREDOMINATE IN A 
WARMING WORLD HERE ARE THE MODELS 
OF CLOUD FEEDBACKS IN THE IPCC 
REPORT ALL BUT ONE ARE ABOVE THE 
LINE PREDICTING THAT CLOUDS WILL 
ACCELERATE FUTURE WARMING WHAT IS 
MOST MODELS ARE WRONG WHAT IS MOST 
CLOUDS MITIGATE WARMING THEN THE 
CLIMATE MIGHT STILL WARM UP BUT NOT 
SO FAR OR SO FAST 
THE CLIMATE 
MODELLERS THEMSELVES ADMIT THAT THE 
BIGGEST UNCERTAINTY IN GLOBAL 
WARMING FOR COSTING IS HOW THE 
CLOUDS WILL RESPOND FORECASTING 
WE HAVE NOT HAD VERY GOOD DATA 
WHICH HAS TO BE FROM SATELLITES TO 
ANSWER THIS QUESTION WE JUST 
HAVEN'T HAD VERY GOOD 
DATA 
FOR MORE 
THAN ABOUT SIX YEARS PERTAINING TO 
CLOUDS 
THE MODELLERS SAY THEIR CLOUDS KNOWLEDGE OF CLOUDS IS INCREASING 
FAST THEY REJECT THE NOTION THAT 
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW CLOUDS AT ALL 
THE BASIC PHYSICS IS WELL KNOWN IT 
IS WHAT ALLOWS US TO DO WEATHER 
FORECASTING EVERY DAY THERE IS OF 
COURSE UNCERTAINTY AND THAT 
DEPENDS ON THE FACT THAT WE CODE IN 
THESE LAWS IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT 
IS WHY WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT 
MODELS TO QUANTIFY THE UNCERTAINTY 
THE CARBON CYCLE IS ANOTHER KEY 
AREA OF UNCERTAINTY THE GREAT 
SYSTEM IN WHICH THE EARTH AND LIFE 
UPON IT BRIEF CARBON IN AND OUT 
BREATHING CARBON WE HAVE TO 
BREATHING CARBON WE HAVE TO MODEL THE TROPICAL RAIN FOREST THE 
OCEANS THE SOIL WE HAVE NO 
FUNDAMENTAL EQUATIONS TO DO THAT 
WHEREAS WHEN WE ARE MODELLING THE 
OCEANS AND THE ATMOSPHERE THE 
PHYSICS OF THE OCEANS AND THE 
ATMOSPHERE WE HAD SOME FUNDAMENTAL 
EQUATIONS WE DON'T HAVE THOSE FOR 
THE LIVING PARTS OF THE SYSTEM 
HERE IS OUR SKETCH OF CARBON CYCLE 
FEEDBACKS FROM THE MET OFFICE 
CENTRE THE BLACK LINE SHOWS C. O. TWO 
EMISSIONS WHICH WILL HEED THE EARTH 
BUT HOW WELL THE PLANETARY AT TWO 
EXTRA HEAT HEAT THE EARTH THE 
SOIL WILL RELEASE MORE C. O. TWO AS THE 
WORLD GETS HOTTER THAT FEEDBACK 
WILL MAKE IT HOTTER STILL 
ALL OF THE MODELS AGREE THAT AS WE 
TURN UP THE HEAT WE GET EXTRA C. O. TWO 
FROM PLANTS AND SOILS OCEAN 
CURRENTS AT MORE UNCERTAINTY NEW 
GERMAN RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT 
NATURAL VARIATIONS IN THE ATLANTIC 
MIGHT HOLD BACK GLOBAL WARMING 
UNTIL TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHEN TEMPERATURES WILL 
RISE AGAIN ON TOP OF ALL THIS 
UNCERTAINTY THERE IS ALSO 
UNCERTAINTY OVER POLICY EVEN IF WE 
ASSUME THAT MAN MADE GLOBAL WARMING 
IS GOING TO BE SERIOUS THERE IS 
NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL WE CAN DO ABOUT 
IT WITHOUT SOME SORT OF NEW ENERGY 
TECHNOLOGY IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW 
MANY COMPACT FLUORESCENT LIGHT 
BULBS YOU USE HOW MANY HYBRID CARS 
YOU BUY EVEN CONVERTING FROM COAL 
POWER PLANTS TO NUCLEAR POWER 
PLANTS YOU'RE STILL GOING TO GET 
TO WHERE YOU NEED TO BE WHICH IS 
AT LEAST A FIFTY PER CENT REDUCTION IN CARBON 
DIOXIDE EMISSIONS 
THERE IS PLENTY 
OF UNCERTAINTY BUT IF WE WAIT 
UNTIL WE ARE CERTAIN WE MAY WAIT 
TOO LONG TO AVOID THE MOST 
DANGEROUS OUTCOMES L. L. THINK THAT 
WOULD BE A VERY UNWISE COURSE OF 
ACTION WE ONLY HAVE ONE PLANET 
UNCERTAINTIES REMAIN OVER EXACTLY 
HOW MUCH THE EARTH WILL HEAT BUT 
THE IMPORTANT DEBATES ABOUT CLOUDS 
AND THE CARBON CYCLE SOME MAY NOT 
BE FULLY RESOLVED FOR DECADE OR 
TWO BY THAT TIME IT WOULD BE TOO 
LATE TO CUT EMISSIONS TO PREVENT 
THE WORST DISASTER SCENARIOS THAT 
IS WHY THIS DEBATE IS NOW MAINLY 
WITH THE POLITICIANS WORLD LEADERS 
AGREE THAT EMISSIONS SHOULD BE CUT 
EVEN THOUGH IN REALITY EMISSIONS 
ARE CONTINUING TO SOAR IT IS AN 
EXPERIMENT WITH THE PLANET HOW 
WILL IT END THE MODEL IS SAY 
THEY NEED ONE THOUSAND TIMES MORE 
COMPUTING POWER SO THEY CAN FIND 
OUT THE MODEL ARES THE ANSWER 
MAY LIE IN THE CLOUDS 
TOMORROW MORNING'S FRONT PAGES THE 
INDEPENDENT HAS NEWS OF THE BURMESE 
CYCLONE THE SAME ON THE FRONT OF 
THE SUN THE TIMES THE REPORT FROM 
EARLIER BROWN FACES NEW THREATS TO 
AUTHORITY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE 
GUARDIAN THE SCOTTISH DECISION 
THE DAILY MAIL WE HAVE LESS TO 
SPEND THAN FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AND MORE 
HORRORS FROM AUSTRIA ON THE FRONT 
PAGE OF THE MIRROR WE LEAVE YOU 
WITH THE POSSIBILITY THAT A 
HISTORICAL WRONG MAY BE RIGHTED IT 
IS ALLEGED A RATHER KEY WORD IN 
THIS CASE THAT IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT NASTY OLD 
DICTATOR GENERAL FRANCO READ THE 
RESULTS OF THE EUROVISION SONG 
CONTEST SO IT WENT TO THE SPANISH 
ENTRY WITH THE KING THE 
QUINTESSENTIAL EUROVISION LYRICS 
LA LA LA STEALING THE TITLE FROM 
SIR CLIFF RICHARDS AND 
CONGRATULATIONS 
CONGRATULATIONS AND CELEBRATIONS 
WHEN I TELL EVERYONE ABOUT YOU'RE 
IN LOVE WITH ME THAT YOU'RE IN 
LOVE WITH ME CONGRATULATIONS AND 
JUDE RELATIONS I WANT THE WORLD TO 
KNOW WE ARE HAPPY AS CAN BE 
AFTER TODAY'S SUNSHINE IT IS CLEAR 
SKY TONIGHT LEADING US INTO 
ANOTHER LOVELY DAY ON WEDNESDAY 
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE ON WEDNESDAY 
MORNING MIST AND FOG IN THE VALE 
OF YORK AND THE CENTRAL LOWLANDS OF 
SCOTLAND IN THE AFTERNOON A BIT 
OF A CHANGE CLOUD DEVELOPING IN 
THE MIDLANDS WALES AND THE NORTH 
WEST BRINGING SHOWERS THE SOUTH 
WEST OF SCOTLAND MAY BE INTO 
CUMBRIA EAST OF THE PENNINES 
ANOTHER LOVELY DAY COOLER ALONG 
THE EAST COAST INLAND IT IS FINE 
AND WARM TWENTY FOUR IN LONDON STILL THE 
BREEZE BLOWS IN A SUNNY BREEZY 
DAY FOR MANY SOUTHERN COUNTIES TWENTY ONE 
DEGREES SEVENTY FAHRENHEIT INTO WALES 
WE PICK UP ON THE SHOWERS MOSTLY 
OVER THE HIGHER GROUND A FEW SHARP 
SHOWERS CARDIFF IS FINE DRY AND 
WARM TWENTY TWO DEGREES THE ODD SHOWER 
FOR LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER MOST 
OF NORTHERN IRELAND WILL HAVE 
SUNSHINE MOST OF US HAVE LOVELY 
DAY ON WEDNESDAY WARM SUNSHINE 
THURSDAY LOOKS PRETTY GOOD AGAIN 
FURTHER SOUTH CHANGE ON THE WAY 
FOR THURSDAY CLOUDING OVER IN 
CARDIFF THAT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE A 
WEATHER FRONT MOVING INTO THE 
SCILLY ISLES EVENTUALLY SOME RAIN 
IN CORNWALL THE CLOUD SPILLING OUT 
ACROSS WALES AND MUCH OF SOUTHERN 
ENGLAND THE FURTHER EAST YOU ARE 
ON THURSDAY THAT IS 
WHAT MAN 
TELL ME WHAT TO DO TO GET MY LIFE BACK 
LAST THING I REMEMBER IS THIS MAN WHAT MAN 
THE GUY WITH THE HORN RIMMED GLASSES 
HOW DOES IT END NOT WELL I'M AFRAID
