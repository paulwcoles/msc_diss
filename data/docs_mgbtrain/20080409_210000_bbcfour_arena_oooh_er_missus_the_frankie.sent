NAUGHTY NOW LISTEN 
I MUST ASK YOU TO SHUT YOUR GOBS 
NO THE THING WAS ONE DAY 
NOW I WAS BORN IN YORK ENGLAND SOME TIME IN THE PAST 
BUT NOT THAT MUCH IN THE PAST 
MY MOTHER TOLD ME THAT MY ENTRY INTO THE WORLD 
WAS MARKED BY A RAGING SNOW STORM 
A HANDSOME BABY ME AH WELL I TOOK AFTER MY MOTHER EDITH 
A VERY PRETTY WOMAN WITH JET BLACK CURLS 
I WAS CHRISTENED FRANCIS ALICK HOWARD AFTER MY FATHER 
SERGEANT FRANK HOWARD OF THE ROYAL ARTILLERY 
NOW WHEN I WAS TWO AND A HALF MY FATHER WAS POSTED TO WOOLWICH 
SO WE MOVED TO ELTHAM A SPRAWLING SUBURB OF SOUTH LONDON 
IT WAS IN ELTHAM THAT MY BROTHER SIDNEY AND SISTER BETTY WERE BORN 
I WAS A VERY TIMID BOY 
TALL AND THIN 
HUH THIN VERY AND UH VERY SHY 
AS A YOUNG CHILD I WAS OBSESSED BY SHOWBIZ AND IT WAS HERE 
THAT I GAVE MY FIRST PERFORMANCE 
THOUGH IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS CALLED ELTHAM PARISH HALL 
I USED TO GO IN FOR TALENT COMPETITIONS A LOT 
I WAS ALWAYS PLUGGING AWAY AT SOMETHING TALENT COMPETITIONS IN THE LOCAL CINEMAS OR THEATRES 
I NEVER PASSED ANY OF THEM BY THE WAY BUT I DID 
YOU KNOW I WAS ALWAYS 
I ALWAYS SORT OF KEPT ON I NEVER GAVE IN REALLY 
WELL I'LL TELL YOU THIS IS THE FIRST TIME OR FIRST PLACE RATHER 
THAT I TROD THE BOARDS 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I MEAN ON THE STAGE IN THIS THEATRE 
IT THEN WAS THE ELTHAM PARISH HALL 
IT WAS USED FOR THE LOCAL AMATEUR DRAMATICS SOCIETY TO DO PLAYS IN 
WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG I WAS A VERY INNOCENT BOY I REALLY WAS 
I WAS VERY NAIVE 
STUPID IS ANOTHER WORD FOR IT OF COURSE BUT I WAS 
I USED TO TELL JOKES I NEVER SAW THE IMPLICATION 
I REALLY DIDN'T 
SO I WROTE A PLAY IT WAS CALLED LORD HALLIDAY'S BIRTHDAY PARTY 
NOW I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT IT EXCEPT THAT I'D WRITTEN 
I'D READ BOOKS AGATHA CHRISTIE 
AND MURDERS AND SO EVERYTHING WAS IN IT 
BITS FROM ALL THE BOOKS I'D EVER READ DIVORCE EVERYTHING 
I DIDN'T REALISE I WAS AVANT GARDE WAY AHEAD OF EVERYBODY ELSE 
BUT THERE WAS A REAL MISH MASH OF 
A SOAP OPERA IT WAS BUT IT WAS VERY FORWARD VERY ADVANCED THINKING I'M TELLING YOU 
OOH NO IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE VERY RISQUE I DIDN'T INTEND IT TO BE 
I JUST GOT YOU KNOW THINGS FROM BOOKS AND THINGS I'D READ 
WITHOUT REALISING I THINK THE IMPLICATION OF WHAT I WAS WRITING ABOUT 
IN FACT MY AUNT AFTERWARDS SAID TO ME WHAT YOU MUST LEARN TO DO 
DON'T WRITE ABOUT THINGS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP TO THINGS YOU UNDERSTAND 
DON'T WRITE ABOUT THINGS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND 
YOU WON'T GET ON IT WON'T HELP YOU AT ALL 
WRITE ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW OR THINK YOU KNOW 
WAS THE PLAY EVER PUT ON NO 
ANOTHER MASTERPIECE I WROTE WAS CALLED SWEET FANNY ADAMS 
AH THE GLOBE THEATRE SHAKESPEARE 
OH LOOK THERE GOES DAME CYBIL FONDYKE 
WELL I WANTED TO TREAD THE BOARDS 
AND TO THE SOUTH BANK CRADLE OF ENGLISH THEATRE I DID GO 
NOT AS AN ACTOR I'D FAILED MY RADA AUDITION 
BUT AS A FILING CLERK IN TOOLEY STREET S. E. ONE 
TO BE OR NOT TO BE 
ALAS IT WAS NOT TO BE 
THE TROUBLE WITH YOU IS HE SAID YOU'RE SO DIFFICULT TO CATEGORISE 
HE SAID YOU SEE YOU DON'T FIT IN ANYWHERE 
YOU'RE NEITHER ONE THING NOR THE OTHER 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT 
BUT HE SAID 
HE SAID PLEASE 
TOO MUCH TITTERING NAUGHTY TITTER MONGERS HERE 
NO HE SAID YOU'RE A SORT OF CROSS BETWEEN BERTIE WOOSTER AND HAROLD STEPTOE 
HE SAID YOU'RE TERRIBLY ILL DEFINED 
I SAID I CAN'T HELP MY LOOKS 
HE SAID NO NO I DON'T MEAN THAT 
YOU'RE NOT WITH IT YOU'RE NOT NINETEEN SIXTY SIX 
AFTER ALL HE SAID YOU'VE GOT A SORT OF MUSTY AMBIENCE OF A BYGONE AGE 
A SORT OF MOULDY PATINA OF INSIPIENT DECAY A SORT OF FOSSILISED 
I SAID ALL RIGHT DON'T GO ON I'VE GOT THE DRIFT 
COR BLIMEY I FELT LIKE SOMETHING THAT MORTIMER WHEELER HAD DUG UP 
HE SAID THAT'S IT IN A NUT SHELL THIS IS A TECHNOL 
TECHNOLOGICAL AGE HE SAID I CAN'T SAY IT MYSELF 
HE SAID IT'S A TECHNOLOGICAL AGE 
I'VE REHEARSED THIS ALL DAY I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY IT BY NOW 
I WILL IF IT KILLS ME THIS IS A TECHNOLOGICAL AGE HE SAID 
HE SAID YOU ARE TO MODERNISE HE SAID MODERNISE 
OR GET OUT MODERNISE OR GET OUT 
AND WITH THAT HE WOUND UP HIS GRAMOPHONE 
AND HE PUT A HENRY HALL RECORD ON 
THIS TALL GANGLY YOUTH CAME UP AND HE SAID TO ME 
DO YOU KNOW A TISKET A TASKET I TOOK ONE LOOK AT HIM 
AND I THOUGHT MY GOD HE CAN'T BE A SINGER SURELY 
AND I SAID WELL WHAT HE SAID CAN YOU PLAY IT WITHOUT MUSIC 
I SAID YES I CAN PLAY IT WITHOUT MUSIC DO YOU SING IT 
HE SAID NO NOT REALLY I JUST MUCK IT ABOUT A BIT 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU START AND I'LL CATCH YOU UP 
WELL THE UPSHOT OF IT WAS TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT 
WE FORMED A CONCERT PARTY WHICH WE CALLED THE COORDINANTS 
DURING THE WAR YEARS WE WENT ROUND 
ALL ROUND ESSEX WITH THE GUN SITES AND WHAT HAVE YOU 
AND I SHOULD THINK WE DID OVER TWO HUNDRED CONCERTS DURING THE WAR YEARS 
BECAUSE I WAS IN THE ARMY THE EARLY DAYS 
THE EARLIER DAYS OF THE WAR WE HAD UM 
WE DID SHOWS IN SHOEBURYNESS IN THE GARRISON THEATRE THERE 
AND THEY WENT VERY WELL 
NOW DOWN 
WHOA THIS IS MY RECORD RIGHT GO 
NOW DOWN IN THE MEADOW IN A LITTLE FISHY POOL 
LIVES THREE LITTLE FISHES AND A MAMMA FISHY TOO 
NOW SWIM SAID THE MAMMA FISHY SWIM IF YOU CAN M. M. M. 
ARE YOU TAKING THE MICKEY 
SO THEY SWAM AND THEY SWAM RIGHT OVER THE DAM 
THERE WAS GEORGE WHOA DIDN DADN WAD WHEEE 
THERE WAS PEARL WHOA DIDN DADN WAD WHEEE 
THERE WAS CECIL WHOA DIDN DADN WAD WHEEE 
SO THE ENTIRE DEFENCE OF SOUTHEND ON SEA 
AND ITS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND INHABITANTS WAS ENTRUSTED TO ME 
GUNNER F. HOWERD I MUST HAVE BEEN A FORMIDABLE SOLDIER 
BECAUSE SOUTHEND WAS NEVER INVADED AND I KNOW HOW GRATEFUL THEY WERE 
WELCOME TO VARIETY BANDBOX 
HOW DO YOU DO THIS IS PHILIP SLESSOR 
SPEAKING TO YOU FROM LONDON PRESENTING THE PEOPLE OF VARIETY TO A VARIETY OF PEOPLE 
SUPPORTING OUR ARTISTS WE HAVE THE BILLY TERNENT ORCHESTRA 
WITH THE MAESTRO HIMSELF BILLY TERNENT 
I MET FRANK FIRST AFTER THE WAR WHEN THE WAR FINISHED 
THEY'D PUT A NOTICE UP ON THE BOARD 
PEOPLE WITH THEATRICAL EXPERIENCE PUT YOUR NAME UP HERE IN GERMANY 
SO IT WAS EITHER THAT OR GO IN THE COOK HOUSE 
I WAS THE PRINCIPLE COMEDIAN OF ONE SHOW 
CALLED STRICTLY OFF THE RECORD 
AND FRANK WAS PRINCIPLE COMEDIAN OF A SHOW CALLED THE WAGONERS 
WE WERE BOTH SERGEANTS BECAUSE YOU HAD TO BE 
TO BE LIKE A PRINCIPLE COMEDIAN 
WE NEVER ACTUALLY MET ONLY ONCE 
WHEN I SAW THIS TALL FIGURE IN A LEATHER JACKET WALK PAST ME 
AND I THOUGHT THAT'S NOT HIM I'VE GOT NO COMPETITION 
AND WE WERE LIKE IN COMPETITION 
THEN FRANK GOT HIS MARVELLOUS CONTRACT WITH VARIETY BANDBOX 
AND HE WROTE TO ME AND SAID CAN I HAVE THE ACT THAT YOU WERE DOING 
I SENT IT TO HIM AND HE SAID HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE 
I SAID WHENEVER YOU LIKE 
SO THEN ON I WROTE ALL HIS STUFF FOR VARIETY BANDBOX 
NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
I'LL JUST MAKE MYSELF COMFY 
NOW THIS IS HONESTLY THIS IS A PROPER GAME TODAY 
THIS IS A GAME YOU KNOW BECAUSE I'M 
I'M THINKING OF PACKING THIS IN I AM I AM 
OH I WAS BETTER OFF WHEN I WAS WITH THE CIRCUS 
I WAS THAT'S THE LIFE THE CIRCUS 
THAT'S THE LIFE IF YOU LIVE 
I KNOW 
I'M TELLING YOU THIS 
LISTEN WHEN THE COCK CROWED WE WERE UP THERE WE WERE 
MIND YOU IT'S A GOOD JOB IT DIDN'T CROW IN THE MORNING BUT STILL 
FRANK USED TO GET A JOKE 
AND WE USED TO I USED TO WRITE AN ACT AND FINISH ON THAT JOKE 
THEN I THOUGHT WHY DO THAT 
LET'S DO SOMETHING ELSE 
SO I DID THE FIRST PERSON SITUATION COMEDY 
LIKE ONE WEEK IT WAS 
OH SHOCKING WEEK OH NO YES AH NO 
NOW I WROTE THOSE THINGS IN AS 
BECAUSE FRANK USED TO USE THOSE 
BUT I WROTE THEM IN AS COMMAS COLONS AND HAVE TO YOU KNOW FULL STOPS 
AND PUT THOSE IN AND HE READ THEM OFF LIKE THAT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY MARVELLOUS 
I WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO THE CAGE 
AND IMMEDIATELY ALL THE LIONS RAN TOWARDS ME I JUST STARED AT THEM 
I JUST STARED AT THEM 
AND THEY ALL SLUNK AWAY THEY DID 
I SAID HOW'S THAT OH YES VERY GOOD HE SAID BUT YOU SHOULD BE INSIDE THE CAGE 
I SAID INSIDE 
THEY'LL TEAR ME TO PIECES 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MAKING ALL THIS FUSS ABOUT 
I CAN ASSURE YOU WE SHALL ALL BE STOOD ROUND THE EDGE WITH GUNS 
IF THERE'S THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE OF YOU BEING TORN TO PIECES 
WE SHALL SHOOT YOU SO HE SAID DON'T WORRY 
AND BEFORE I COULD ARGUE 
CEASE BEFORE I COULD A. R. 
CEASE OH YOU MAKE ME MAD 
HE WAS A LITTLE UNCERTAIN I MEAN HE WAS TERRIBLE TO BE IN A DRESSING ROOM WITH 
HE WAS A BAG OF NERVES 
THERE WAS A GUY SAYING YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING DON'T FLUSTER LIKE THAT 
WE HAD AN IMPRESARIO NAMED JACK PAYNE 
WHO REALLY GAVE HIM A VERY VERY BAD TIME HE COULDN'T QUITE SEE 
HE COULDN'T QUITE SEE THE TALENT IN FRANK 
HE GAVE HIM A HARD TIME AND WE HAD A STAGE MANAGER NAMED BILL LYON SHAW 
AND HE USED TO CARRY OUT ALL MR. PAYNE'S 
WE WERE FRANK AND I WERE DEAD SCARED OF HIM 
WHEN WE KNEW HE WAS IN THE THEATRE WE USED TO HIDE USED TO GO IN THE DRESSING ROOM 
BUT HE WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE FRUSTRATED FRANK WAS 
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO DO THIS ACT 
THE ONLY ACT HE KNEW AND THEY WERE INSISTING THAT HE GET IT RIGHT 
SOMETIMES HE'D COME HOME FROM THE THEATRE WE'D ALL BE IN THESE DIGS 
THEN HE'D SAY AFTER WE'D EATEN 
WHICH WAS ABOUT MIDNIGHT HE'D SAY I'M GOING FOR A WALK 
AND HE USED TO SIT IN THE QUIETEST PLACES TO THINK HIS ACT OUT 
HE WAS ALL THE WHOLE CONCENTRATION WAS ON HIS ACT 
HE USED TO SIT IN CEMETERIES IN GRAVEYARDS AND 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANYONE WALKING THROUGH THE GRAVEYARD WOULD'VE THOUGHT 
HE USED TO SIT ON A GRAVESTONE I GUESS THAT WAS THE QUIETEST PLACE 
HE COULD FIND AND HE WOULD GO THROUGH HIS ACT 
I TELL YOU HE WAS A GREAT CONTRADICTION A GREAT FELLOW 
BUT A GREAT CONTRADICTION 
WHEN I WAS YOUNG I LIVED IN THE MOVIES ALMOST IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
NOT SO MUCH FOR COMICS NOT COMEDY PARTS SO MUCH 
IT WAS THE DRAMA IT WAS THE 
THE ROMANCE THE ROMANTIC HERO 
THAT'S THE SORT OF THINGS I VISUALISED MYSELF DOING 
IN MY FANTASY WORLD AND I WANTED TO BE A. 
I WANTED TO BE A BIG HOLLYWOOD MOVIE STAR THAT WAS MY AMBITION 
ROTTEN JOURNEY WHERE'S THE LADIES 
NOT ALREADY SURELY 
I'M GOING IN THERE TO PUT SOME LINIMENT ON MY BACK 
YOU CAN'T RUB THAT STUFF ON IN HERE YOU'LL STINK THE PLACE OUT 
IT'S BAD ENOUGH WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR HANDBAG 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A GLAMOROUS YOUNG STARLET 
WELL I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING I'M NOT GOING HOME LIKE THIS AGAIN 
I'M GOING BY TUBE I'M NOT 
LOOK I DON'T CARE HOW YOU GO HOME DEAR 
HELLO DARLING HOW ARE YOU 
I LOVE THAT THING YOU DID LAST 
OH JOLLY GOOD 
WHO WAS THAT GAWD KNOWS 
YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE FIELD IN THIS GAME 
AH THERE WE ARE IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND HERE WE ARE 
EXCUSE ME SIR NO I'M IN THE CENTRE THANK YOU SO MUCH 
IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS HE WANTED TO BE 
HE WANTED TO BE MORE SUAVE SOPHISTICATED MORE LIKE JACK BUCHANAN 
I THINK JACK AND BEATRICE LILLIE AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT WERE HIS IDOLS 
I SAID TO HIM FRANK YOU CAN'T BE JACK BUCHANAN BECAUSE JACK BUCHANAN IS HIM THAT'S WHY HE IS THERE 
I BET YOU HE IS EATING HIS HEART OUT TO BE LIKE FRANKIE HOWERD 
AND THIS SYNDROME OF GOING THROUGH AND WANTING TO BE SOMETHING ELSE 
YOU WANT TO PROVE TO PEOPLE HOW GOOD YOU ARE 
BUT THE CLEVER THE REALLY FUNNY PEOPLE LIKE TOMMY COOPER 
HE ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT HE WAS TOMMY COOPER AND HE WASN'T OH OH SEVEN 
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A TIME WHEN HE DID THINK HE WAS 
AND WHEN HE WALKS INTO A ROOM AH HA 
HE WAS A KIDDIE AND THEY WERE ALL LAUGHING AND HE LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER TO SEE WHO ELSE HAD COME IN 
I DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTAND HOW GOOD THEY NEVER SEE THEMSELVES 
THEY KNOW THEMSELVES AND THEY LOOK IN THE MIRROR 
IN THE MORNINGS WHEN THEY'RE SHAVING 
AND THEY SEE THE FACE THEY'VE SEEN ALL THEIR LIVES 
THE FACE THAT HAD NOTHING THAT WAS TREATED AS NOTHING YEARS AGO 
IF THEY'D COME FROM POOR AREAS 
A FACE THAT WAS THAT SAME FACE IS STILL THERE 
THEY CAN'T SEE IT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CAN SEE IT 
THE ONLY TIME THEY CAN SEE IT IS WHEN THEY 
IT'S LIKE RUSHES ON A FILM AND SOME OF THEM DON'T LIKE LOOKING AT THEM 
IT'S THEM YOU SEE THEY CAN'T 
YOU SEE THEM BUT THEY SEE THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY 
THEY STILL SEE THIS HALF OUT OF HIS TROUSERS LITTLE GUY 
THAT THEY USED TO BE STILL THERE SHINING THROUGH 
THEY NEVER SEE THEMSELVES PROPERLY 
IT'S THE WRONG TIME AND THE WRONG PLACE 
THOUGH YOUR FACE IS CHARMING IT'S THE WRONG FACE 
IT'S NOT HER FACE BUT IT'S A CHARMING FACE 
AND IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME 
IT'S THE WRONG SONG IN THE WRONG STYLE 
THOUGH YOUR SMILE IS LOVELY IT'S THE WRONG SMILE 
IT'S NOT HER SMILE BUT IT'S A LOVELY SMILE 
AND IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME 
I NEVER HAD ANY AMBITIONS TO BE HAMLET 
NEVER HAD A HAMLET COMPLEX 
WELL I SAY NEVER BUT I MEAN AFTER I DECIDED TO BE 
I DIDN'T DECIDE TO BE A COMEDIAN I TRIED AND INTENDED TO BE 
BUT I WENT WHAT I DID I WENT INTO PLAYS COMEDY PLAYS 
AND I DID CHARLIE'S AUNT AND THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND THEN I DID 
ON TELEVISION THAT WAS THE SCHOOL FOR WIVES WHICH IS A FUNNY PLAY 
AND THIS MAN RANG ME UP AND SAID WE'D LIKE YOU TO DO SOMETHING AT THE VIC 
SO I SAID YEAH SURE 
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE VICTORIA PALACE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT 
AND I SAID WHAT IS IT YOU WANT ME TO DO 
SO HE SAID A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM 
SO I SAID MIDSUMMER NIGHT 
I SAID OH WELL I SAID I I SUPPOSE I COULD DO IT 
I THOUGHT I MUST PLAY THIS PART 
WE WE REHEARSED IN THIS EMPTY THEATRE NO CEILING OR ANYTHING 
NO LIGHTS MUCH VERY GLOOMY IT WAS AND I WAS VERY YOU KNOW I WAS VERY 
GETTING WORSE AND WORSE WITH THINKING NOISES THIS IS A DEFINITE DISASTER 
THIS IS A MISTAKEN JUDGMENT TO THINK I COULD DO THIS AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER THE WORDS I COULDN'T 
IT WAS JUST AWFUL AND I KNEW IT WAS AWFUL AND THE DIRECTOR 
I KNEW THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS AWFUL AND SO DID EVERYBODY ELSE 
BUT THESE SHAKESPEAREAN ACTORS WERE VERY NICE TO ME INDEED COMING IN FROM THE MUSICAL HALLS 
AND I WAS ONE OF VERY FEW PEOPLE TO DO THIS 
THE ONLY OTHER PERSON TO MY KNOWLEDGE BEFORE THIS WAS A MAN CALLED SIR GEORGE ROBEY 
WHO PLAYED IN FALSTAFF IN SHAKESPEARE 
BUT I WAS A SORT OF A. IT WAS A SORT OF WHAT'S THE WORD UH 
SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT AND THEY WEREN'T USED TO IT AND I CERTAINLY WASN'T 
ANYWAY 
SO I. I THOUGHT THAT'S IT I'LL DO THIS IF IT KILLS ME 
SO I CAME ON THERE EVERY NIGHT IT WAS A MARVELLOUS AUDIENCE 
AND I MUST SAY IT WENT VERY VERY WELL AND I GOT 
I WAS LUCKY AND I GOT FORTUNATELY I GOT 
THE CRITICS WERE EXTREMELY KIND TO ME AND I GOT A VERY GOOD PRESS INDEED 
AND I THINK THAT THEY WERE SO SURPRISED THAT I COULD ACTUALLY DO IT 
I MEAN NOT DO IT WELL BUT JUST DO IT AT ALL 
I TELL YOU SOMETHING AS A PROJECTIONIST 
THERE IS ONE FILM I DON'T THINK I WOULD DARE SHOW 
AND THAT IS A FILM I WAS IN CALLED THE COOL MIKADO 
WHICH WAS BASED LOOSELY AND I MEAN LOOSELY ON THE THE MIKADO 
GILBERT AND SULLIVAN YOU KNOW AND IT WAS MADE 
IT WAS THE FIRST FILM ACTUALLY MADE BY THE NOW FAMOUS DIRECTOR MICHAEL WINNER 
HE SAID IT'S GOING TO BE MARVELLOUS YOU'LL BE MARVELLOUS IN IT 
I DIDN'T GET PAID VERY MUCH BUT I WAS GRATEFUL FOR THE MONEY THEN 
BECAUSE I WAS DOING VERY BADLY 
BUT AFTER THIS FILM WAS FINISHED I STEELED MYSELF TO WATCH IT 
AND I MUST TELL YOU 
I COULDN'T MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF IT 
COMICS FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES 
THE LEAST FREQUENT IS THE COMIC WHO IS ALWAYS TELLING JOKES AND VERY FUNNY IN REAL LIFE 
JIMMY TARBUCK FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY 
FRANKIE IS IN THE CATEGORY OF NEARLY ALL COMICS THEY ARE IN REAL LIFE EXTREMELY MISERABLE 
THEY ARE TORMENTED THEY ARE IRASCIBLE 
VERY NICE PEOPLE 
BUT DEEPLY SENSITIVE AND NOT BASICALLY JOLLY 
ALL THEIR JOLLINESS 
AND EXUBERANCE IS RESERVED FOR THE STAGE OR FOR THE PERFORMANCE 
THERE'S NO QUESTION FRANKIE IS IN THAT CATEGORY 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE WAS DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH OF COURSE HE WAS NOT 
HE'S A TERRIBLY NICE CHAP BUT NOT THE CHAP YOU'D GO TO IF YOU WANT A LAUGH AND TOMMY COOPER'S THE SAME 
I REMEMBER ONCE SAYING TO TOMMY COOPER TELL ME A JOKE YOU'D THINK YOU'D ASKED HIM TO 
TO DISCOVER ATOMIC FUSION HE WENT INTO ABSOLUTELY PANIC AT THE THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE TO TELL YOU A JOKE 
FRANKIE WAS OF THAT ILK 
THE FLOWERS THAT BLOOM IN THE SPRING 
BREATHE PROMISE OF MERRY SUNSHINE 
AS WE MERRILY DANCE AND WE SING 
WE WELCOME THE HOPE THAT THEY BRING 
AH THE SUMMER OF ROSES AND WINE 
THE SUMMER OF ROSES AND WINE 
WELL THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN 
WHEN WE SAY THAT THE THING 
IS WELCOME AS FLOWERS THAT BLOOM IN THE SPRING 
AT THE TIME IT DID GET TERRIBLE REVIEWS 
IT WAS CALLED INCOMPREHENSIBLE RUBBISH AND IN FACT FRANKIE 
BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE KINDER REVIEWS INCOMPREHENSIBLE RUBBISH YOU'RE QUOTING THE GOOD ONES 
I REMEMBER ONE OF THE NEWSPAPERS DURING THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
DESCRIBED BOTH OF US AS THE HIGHEST PAID PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY 
THE TWO HIGHEST PAID PERSONS IN THE COUNTRY 
I MEAN WE WERE CLEANING UP WE 
IT WAS UH NOT BY TODAY'S STANDARDS LIKE THE ROCK AND ROLL KIDS 
BUT I REMEMBER ONCE I SAID TO FRANK HOW'S THINGS 
AND HE SAID NOT TOO GOOD AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EARS 
I SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOT TOO GOOD 
HE SAID I'M HAVING A LOT OF FINANCIAL TROUBLE 
I SAID WELL WHY BECAUSE YOU KNOW 
I KNEW HE WAS EARNING GREAT MONEY I KNEW THAT HE 
HE DIDN'T HAVE SORT OF THINGS LIKE I HAD AND ERIC SYKES AND HARRY SECOMBE 
WE ALL HAD KIDS WE HAD TO HAVE A MORTGAGE FOR A HOUSE WE 
HAD TO HAVE THE KIDS EDUCATED CAR 
FRANK DIDN'T OWN A CAR HE DIDN'T OWN A HOUSE HE DIDN'T DRINK HE DIDN'T SMOKE HE DIDN'T HAVE GIRLFRIENDS 
AND HE WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST HIGHEST PAID MEN IN THE COUNTRY 
AND I SAID OH FRANK YOU MUST BE KIDDING I SAID WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH IT ALL 
HE SAID YOU'VE NO IDEA HOW I WAS RIPPED OFF HE SAID IN THE EARLY DAYS 
I'M JUST GETTING ON MY FEET NOW HE SAID 
BUT THE MANAGERS AND EVERYBODY THROUGH NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO BUSINESS HE SAID 
THEY THEY ALMOST LEFT ME BROKE SAD 
WELL IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD SUCH A ROUGH TIME OF IT 
IN THE EARLY SIXTIES NINETEEN SIXTY SIXTY ONE FIFTY NINE SIXTY SIXTY ONE SIXTY TWO BUT I WAS 
I COULDN'T GET WORK I BECAME UNFASHIONABLE I SUPPOSE 
AND I LOST CONFIDENCE AND I WAS VERY I GOT VERY DOWN 
AND UM THERE IS AN OLD EXPRESSION WHICH YOU'VE HEARD 
I DON'T DOUBT IT NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS AND IT 
IT IS OFTEN TRUE IN LIFE THAT ONE 
ONE THING LEADS TO ANOTHER 
IT'S LIKE A VICIOUS CIRCLE 
YOU LOSE YOUR NERVE 
AND THEN YOU DON'T DO SO WELL AND THEN YOU'RE NOT WANTED SO YOU LOSE YOUR NERVE MORE 
AND YOU DON'T DO SO WELL AND OF COURSE IT GOES ON AND ON AND GRADUALLY YOU SORT SPIRAL DOWNWARDS 
AND IT 
IT WAS VERY STRANGE IF YOU THINK THAT SORT OF THING IS STRANGE 
BECAUSE MY MOTHER DIED SHE HAD BEEN ILL 
AND AT THE END OF THIS PERIOD IT WAS 
THIS WAS ALL THE SAME TIME 
AND MY MOTHER DIED I SUDDENLY THOUGHT TO MYSELF I WAS VERY VERY VERY VERY UPSET 
VERY DISTRESSED INDEED AND I REMEMBER 
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK OF IT 
PEOPLE ARE SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT FRIENDSHIPS 
AND I THOUGHT DOES IT MATTER 
WHAT'S ALL THIS NONSENSE REALLY ABOUT SHOW BUSINESS 
AND FAME AND ONE THING AND ANOTHER 
AND FORTUNES AND FAME 
WHEN IT COMES TO REALITIES OF PEOPLE 
AND THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER IN LIFE 
AND I CHANGED A LOT THEN AND STRANGELY ENOUGH 
IT WAS TO ME IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY TO EVERYBODY ELSE IT WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE 
TO OTHER PEOPLE IT WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE WHATSOEVER 
BUT ALMOST WITHIN TWO DAYS THE PHONE RANG WHICH IT HADN'T BEEN DOING 
FOR ME TO DO SOMETHING ON TELEVISION APPEARING ON A TELEVISION SHOW 
IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH I'D SORT OF 
OH IT DOESN'T MATTER AND THEN SUDDENLY IT STARTED AND BACK I WAS AGAIN IN SHOW BUSINESS 
BUT THIS TIME MY ATTITUDE WAS A LOT DIFFERENT 
I SAW HIM PERFORM LOTS OF TIMES PANTOMIMES AND THINGS LIKE THAT I DON'T REMEMBER 
THE FIRST ONE 
THE SORT OF MOULD BREAKING ONE 
I SUPPOSE THAT I REMEMBER MOST VIVIDLY WAS AT THE ESTABLISHMENT WHEN PETER COOK 
BOOKED HIM IN THERE TO DO HIS ACT AND THAT WAS STAGGERING 
WHAT WAS IT LIKE WELL IT WAS JUST 
I THINK IT WAS ABOUT AN HOUR OF NON STOP LAUGHTER 
IT FOLLOWED A FORMULA WHICH HE'S OFTEN DONE SINCE WHICH IS OF 
SORT OF PRETENDING THAT HE'D BEEN HIRED FOR NO MONEY WHEN HE HADN'T BEEN HIRED FOR VERY MUCH MONEY 
AND THEN BERATING THE MANAGEMENT AND THEN GOING ON TO 
HE HAD CAUGHT ON THAT SATIRE WAS THE NEW THING 
SO THERE WAS THIS SORT OF PRETEND SATIRE THAT HE USED TO DO 
I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU'D PUT IT IT WAS AN AVANT GARDE CLUB WHERE A LOT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WENT 
A SATIRICAL CLUB I THINK THEY USED TO CALL IT MORE OR LESS AND SO IN A FIT OF ALCOHOL 
I'D HAD A DRINK AFTER THE 
ALL THESE AWARDS AND I PHEW I'VE DONE MY STUFF LET'S HAVE A DRINK 
I WOULD HAVE AGREED TO GO TO THE MOON 
AND UH 
WELL WHEN I. NEXT DAY WHEN I REALISED WHAT I'D DONE 
AND I'D PROMISED TO APPEAR AT THE ESTABLISHMENT CLUB WHICH I THOUGHT WAS COMPLETELY UNSUITABLE FOR ME 
I'M JUST A HUMBLE COMIC 
AND I TRIED TO GET OUT OF IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT'S STUPID I MUST HAVE BEEN MAD 
PARTICULARLY WHEN I HEARD I WAS GOING TO FOLLOW IN A COMEDIAN CALLED LENNY BRUCE 
HE WAS A VERY WAY OUT VERY ALTERNATIVE COMEDIAN VERY 
I MEAN HE WAS UH 
HE WENT INTO AREAS WHERE NO ONE DARE GO 
OR HAD NEVER DARED GO BEFORE AND I THOUGHT I. IT'S LIKE 
IT WOULD BE LIKE THE LORD MAJOR'S SHOW YOU KNOW AFTERWARDS 
SO UM I TRIED TO GET OUT OF IT 
ANYWAY THEY SAID NO YOU CAN'T 
AND MY AGENT AT THAT TIME WHO WAS A LADY AGENT SAID YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU CAN'T LET THEM DOWN 
YOU'VE SAID YOU'LL DO IT AND YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT 
AND I YOU KNOW YES YES MA'AM MADAM AND I DID IT 
AND NOW THE WEEK AT WESTMINSTER 
AND OUR LOBBY CORRESPONDENT IS MR. FRANKIE HOWERD 
UH BEFORE WE UH THIS IS AM I. THIS IS THE ONE I'M ON YES 
IT'S ABOUT TIME I'VE BEEN WAITING A HELL OF A TIME HERE TO GET ON IT'S TWENTY FIVE TO TWELVE 
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF I'D HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER SHAVE BEFORE I GOT ON BUT NEVER MIND 
SO I ENJOYED BITS OF IT 
UM 
AND I MEAN THE BITS I UNDERSTOOD LADIES AND GENTLEMEN NO UM 
BEFORE I START THIS LITTLE LECTURE 
I THOUGHT I OUGHT REALLY TO EXPLAIN WHAT I'M DOING HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
BECAUSE AS YOU PERHAPS KNOW I'M NOT NORMALLY 
VARIETY COMEDIAN YOU KNOW MUSICAL HALL AND I'M NOT USUALLY 
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SOPHISTICATED WA 
WAGS AND WITS YOU KNOW THESE YOUNGSTERS AND UM 
YOU KNOW I'M MORE SORT OF BILLY COTTON ME 
AND SO I THOUGHT I WANT TO APOLOGISE IN A WAY 
HAS SOMEONE DROPPED SOMETHING 
I SHALL I SHALL DROP A FEW TONIGHT SO DON'T WORRY 
NO THE UM NO THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL AD LIBBING 
YOU NEVER GET THAT ON THIS PROGRAMME NOW 
NO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I WAS ASKED

UNDER THE NEXT DRIER WAS THIS FAMILIAR FACE NO THIS FACE 
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ME AT FIRST AND I LOOKED 
COS IT WAS DAVID FROST 
AND 
YOU KNOW THE ONE WHO WEARS HIS HAIR BACK TO FRONT AND HE 
NO NO NO 
I SHALL NEVER REALLY FORGET THE MOMENT IN 
THAT WAS THE WEEK WHEN ABOUT TWO OR THREE MINUTES IN 
YOU SUDDENLY SENSED THAT HE KNEW THAT THIS WAS AN OPEN ENDED PROGRAMME 
AND HE WASN'T GOING TO BE CUT OFF AND THE CREDITS WEREN'T GOING TO ROLL IGNOMINIOUSLY 
AND THE AUDIENCE WERE LOVING HIM 
AND HE BECAME EXPANSIVE AND HAPPY AND TOTALLY MASTER OF THE SITUATION 
SHOW PARTLY BECAUSE 
NO OBVIOUSLY 
MAC HAS TAKEN REG OBVIOUSLY TO ONE SIDE 
AND SAID NOW LOOK DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT RILES THEM BECAUSE 
DON'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR WE'VE HAD TO COPE WITH THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS 
I MEAN BEFORE IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS OF ROBIN DAY HE WAS BEFORE YOU SEE

AND UH 
AND 
HASN'T HE GOT CRUEL GLASSES HAVE YOU NOTICED 
CRUEL GLASSES 
THEY'VE EXPECTED OBVIOUSLY MAC HAD SAID TO REG 
IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL WE SHALL END UP IN THAT SONG THEY SING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW 
THE ONE YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT MILLIE MARTIN SINGS 
THE ONE YOU CAN'T HEAR THE WORDS OF AND I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW 
AND HE'S OBVIOUSLY THOUGHT AND OF COURSE 
I'VE HEARD MAC HIMSELF SAY HE'S VERY WORRIED ABOUT NEDDY THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NED SHERRIN YOU SEE 
NOW WOULD YOU MIND IF I SAT DOWN BECAUSE I'VE STOOD LONG ENOUGH WOULD YOU MIND 
BRING THE CAMERA IN A BIT 
NO I MEAN THE MONEY THEY'RE PAYING ME I SHOULD BE DYNAMIC 
NO NO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN NO BUT UM I MEAN YOU SEE 
IT'S CONFIDENTIAL ISN'T IT IT'S ENGAGING 
IT'S SORT OF UM BECKONING BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS A SENSE OF DANGER ABOUT IT 
HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO SQUELCH ON SOMEBODY AND IT COULD BE YOU YOU FEEL 
IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME AS DAME EDNA GOING OUT 
AND GRABBING SOMEBODY IN THE AUDIENCE AND BELABOURING THEM 
BUT BOTH THE WAY THAT HE DEALS WITH THAT LADY PIANIST UPSTAGE 
OR DEALS WITH TROUBLE OFFSTAGE 
OR TITTER YE NOT TO SOMEBODY OUT THERE 
THERE'S ALWAYS A SENSE THAT HE'S A BIG MAN AND 
YOU FEEL THAT UNDER THOSE HOODED EYELIDS 
THERE COULD BE A SORT OF TERRIBLE BARB WAITING TO COME 
BUT YET AT THE SAME TIME YOU SUSPECT THAT'LL ONLY BE IF YOU DESERVE IT 
SHALL WE JUST HAVE A CIGARETTE ON IT 
YES 
HERE YOU ARE GRAB HOLD OF THIS 
PARDON THIS CIGARETTE 
IT'S THE WRONG END OH I BEG YOUR PARDON I'M SORRY THERE WE ARE 
THE THING IS UNFORTUNATELY I DO NOT SMOKE 
WELL NEITHER DO I 
OH WELL IN THAT CASE IT'S JUST AS WELL IT SAYS NO SMOKING 
I'M SORRY FRANK WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE FILM 
IT'S A REAL WEEPY ISN'T IT IT IS ISN'T IT 
OH I LOVE THESE OLD FILMS 
SO DO I I ALWAYS WATCH THEM ON TELEVISION 
THEY'RE SO ROMANTIC AREN'T THEY 
THAT'S THE WORD ROMANTIC 
AND GLAMOROUS WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG I WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR A STRAIGHT ACTOR DOING ALL THIS STUFF REALLY 
YES DID YOU OH OH TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY YES 
BUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING A COMIC ESPECIALLY A GOOD ONE 
NO THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT IF YOU CAN GET TO BE ONE 
AH BUT GOODNESS YOU SEE THAT'S THE TROUBLE GOODNESS GOODNESS THIS IS 
THIS IS VERY PROFOUND YES 
GOODNESS LIKE BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER SKIN DEEP OH SORRY 
NO EYE OF THE BEHOLDER EYE OF THE BEHOLDER RIGHT DIFFERENT PEOPLE LAUGH AT DIFFERENT THINGS 
THAT'S WHAT I THINK 
WE TEND TO SORT OF CRY AT THE SAME THINGS BUT WE DON'T TEND TO LAUGH AT THE SAME THINGS 
TRUE ONE MAN'S MEAT HA HA HA IS ANOTHER MAN'S POISON EUGH 
OH ISN'T HE MARVELLOUS I THINK HE'S WONDERFUL OH HE'S A SCREAM MAKES ME DIE 
THE OTHER ONE'S SAYING OH BUT I CAN'T STAND HIM CAN'T SEE IT M. M. M. THAT'S RIGHT 
I THINK IT'S A VERY TRICKY BUSINESS I. I THINK PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE A. 
PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE WHAT THEY CALL A STAND UP COMIC STANDING UP THERE ON YOUR OWN 
OH THE WORSE JOB IN THE WORLD 
IT'S BEST TO KEEP ON THE MOVE ACTUALLY DON'T KEEP STANDING SOMETIMES 
BUT I SHOULD THINK YOU HAVE WORKED WITH MORE COMEDIANS THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE BUSINESS 
I'M QUITE SURE THAT'S TRUE WELL IN YOUR EXPERIENCE OF COMEDIANS 
WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU'VE COME ACROSS MANY WHAT THEY CALL BROKEN HEARTED CLOWNS 
WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT 
BUT ONE OR TWO OF THEM ARE A LITTLE BIT NEUROTIC 
YOU LOOKED STRAIGHT AT ME WHEN YOU SAID THAT 
NO NEVER GOOD HEAVENS NO HEAVEN FORFEND OH WELL I DON'T KNOW 
THE THING IS I DON'T THINK THAT COMEDIANS HAVE A MONOPOLY OF SUFFERING AND BEING BROKEN HEARTED 
I DON'T THINK THAT MYSELF AND OR NEUROSIS NO OR NEUROSIS 
OTHER PEOPLE IF YOU LIKE USE THAT EXPRESSION NEUROTIC 
I THINK WHERE COMEDIANS ARE LUCKY 
TO SOME EXTENT THEY CAN GET RID OF THEIR NEUROSES PLURAL IN THEIR WORK 
THEY CAN UNLEASH IT LET IT GO OUT BY GOING OH ER THEY GET RID OF 
IF THEY WEREN'T NEUROTIC THEY WOULDN'T BE DOING IT PROBABLY NOT 
BUT AT LEAST THEY CAN GET RID OF SOME OF IT ON THE STAGE RIGHT 
THIS SUEDE UNDERWEAR 
IT DOES RUB YOU UP THE WRONG WAY DOESN'T IT 
HELLO OH IS THAT FRANKIE HOWERD OH IT'S BERNARD DELFONT HERE 
SO I SAID IS THIS REALLY BERNARD DELFONT HE SAID YES 
I SAID I'M SO SORRY 
HE SAID WOULD YOU MIND HURRYING UP PLEASE BECAUSE MY TWO P. IS RUNNING OUT IN THE BOX

AND IT CAME TO PASS 
MY MASTER AND MISTRESS HAVING A ROW

I DIDN'T WANT TO GET 
TYPECAST AS A ROMAN SLAVE 
I DIDN'T WANT TO FINISH 
GO ON BEING A ROMAN SLAVE AND NEVER BE ABLE TO GET AWAY FROM IT 
BECAUSE THE THINGS YOU CAN DO THE AMOUNT OF JOKES YOU CAN DO

BUT BECAUSE IT'S FRANK HE GOES AND HE GOES AND HE'S LIKE 
HIS EGG GETTING UNIFORM WHICH HE GOT FROM CECIL GEE'S AND I MEAN IT'S A. 
IT'S A. THIS IS SURREALISTIC AND THIS IS FRANK 
SO HE IS I. I DON'T THINK HE'S 
HE IS NOT AN ORDINARY ACTOR WHEN HE TRIES TO BE 
TO PLAY A ROLE LIKE HE'S DONE IN CARRY ONS 
HE STANDS OUT OF CARRY ON THINGS LIKE A SORE THUMB 
AND NOT ALWAYS FOR THE BETTER BUT THE FACT THAT HE IS NOT PART OF THE UM CAST LIST
