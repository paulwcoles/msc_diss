FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST THE 
NICE DECADE IS BEHIND US 
ALSO ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
GORDON BROWN'S BIG IDEAS FROM 
HOUSING TO SCHOOLS HE TRIES TO 
REGAIN THE POLITICAL HIGH GROUND 
IN CHINA THE DEATH TOLL RISES TO 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND BUT THE RESCUE EFFORTS 
CONTINUE FOR THE MANY STILL TRAPPED 
UNDER THE RUBBLE 
AND MANCHESTER WELCOMES UP TO 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND RANGERS FANS EUROPEAN CUP 
GLORY COULD BE JUST HOURS AWAY HOW HOW DID YOU GET A TICKET THREE HUNDRED 
WHY OUR THREE HUNDRED GOT IT WAS WORTH IT 
IT IS ONCE IN 
A LIFETIME 
ON B. B. C. LONDON 
PATIENTS SAY THE U. K.'S WORST 
HOSPITALS ARE IN THE CAPITAL 
AND GUILTY THE BROTHERS WHO 
KILLED THIS FATHER OF TWO AFTER 
TRYING TO STEAL HIS CAR STEREO 
GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE B. B. C. 
NEWS AT SIX SAY GOODBYE TO THE 
GOOD TIMES THAT WAS THE MESSAGE 
FROM THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND AS HE DELIVERED THE 
GLOOMIEST ECONOMIC FORECAST FOR TEN 
YEARS MERVYN KING SAID WE SHOULD 
BE PREPARED FOR DOUBLE WHAMMY 
THE COST OF LIVING WILL GO UP BUT 
YOUR WAGES WILL BE WORTH LESS 
INFLATION COULD RISE TO NEARLY FOUR PER CENT 
OUR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT REPORTS 
ON THE END OF WHAT MR. KING CALLED 
THE NICE DECADE 
PRICES IN THE SHOPS UTILITY BILLS 
THE COST OF FILLING UP AT THE PUMPS 
ALL RISING RAPIDLY AND DRIVING 
INFLATION HIGHER SO EXPECT THE 
REAL VALUE OF YOUR PAY PACKET TO 
FALL THAT WAS TODAY'S WARNING FROM 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND ITS BLEAKEST 
IN YEARS 
AND THE TIME BEING AT 
LEAST THE NICE DECADE IS BEHIND US 
THE CREDIT CYCLE HAS TURNED 
COMMODITY PRICES ARE RISING WE ARE 
TRAVELLING ALONG A BUMPY ROAD AS 
THE ECONOMY WE BALANCES 
SO WHAT 
DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAD IN MIND 
THE GOVERNOR HAD IN MIND WHEN HE 
WARNS OF A BUMPY ROAD AHEAD HE 
BELIEVES INFLATION COULD JUMP TO 
THREE POINT SEVEN PER CENT LATER THIS YEAR NEARLY 
DOUBLE ITS TARGET WITH HOUSEHOLD 
ENERGY BILLS RISING ANOTHER FIFTEEN PER CENT 
SO DO NOT EXPECT ANY BIG CUTS IN 
INTEREST RATES AT THE SAME TIME 
HE THINKS GROWTH WILL SLOW ABRUPTLY 
TO AS LITTLE AS ONE PER CENT WHILE HOUSE 
PRICE FALLS WILL CONTINUE SO THERE 
IS NO COMFORT FOR THE HOUSING 
MARKET WHERE FIRST TIME BUYERS AND 
MANY OTHERS ARE STILL FINDING IT 
HARD TO GET A MORTGAGE THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH HAS NOT BE USED AND LENDERS 
ARE RELUCTANT TO MAKE LOANS 
CONFIDENCE HAS TAKEN A KNOCK AND 
HERE AT MERSEYSIDE'S BIGGEST ESTATE 
AGENCY FIRM THEY HAVE A BLUNT 
MESSAGE FOR THE BANKS 
UNLESS THEY 
SHOW MORE CONFIDENCE AND MORE 
INSPIRATION AND ACT LIKE A BANK 
SHOULD ACT ARE YOU LEND MONEY IT 
MAY GET WORSE 
PROPER US LIKE THESE 
IN LIVERPOOL SHOPPERS WILL BE 
CAUGHT IN THE INCOME SQUEEZE WHICH 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS ANTICIPATING 
THE BECAUSE I HAVE A MORTGAGE I 
WILL PAY MORE 
EVERYTHING IS 
GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE 
THE ECONOMY 
IS A DISGRACE 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
LOOK AT THE CITY CENTRE THE PRICE 
OF EVERYTHING 
THEY ARE IS A BIG 
NEW RETAIL DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY 
THE MANAGEMENT IS CONFIDENT IT WILL 
BE FULLY OCCUPIED BY THE OPENING IN 
SEPTEMBER BUT THE FIRST PHASE IS 
DUE TO OPEN SOON SOME UNITS WILL 
BE EMPTY AND RETAIL EXPERTS SAY 
THAT IS UNUSUAL AND A SIGN OF THE 
TIMES PERHAPS HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS 
ARE UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE OF 
RISING PRICES THERE IS NEWS TODAY 
THAT UNEMPLOYMENT IS ON THE 
INCREASE THE BANK OF ENGLAND EVEN 
SAYS RECESSION IS A POSSIBILITY 
THAT GLOOMY FORECAST CAME AS THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS FIGHTING HARD TO 
REGAIN THE POLITICAL INITIATIVE 
GORDON BROWN SET OUT A RAFT OF 
PLANS FOR THE YEAR AHEAD TO CREATE 
WHAT HE CALLED A FAIRER MORE 
PROSPEROUS BRITAIN BUT THE 
CONSERVATIVES CLAIMED MANY OF THE 
PROPOSALS WERE STOLEN FROM THEM 
AND MR. BROWN HAD RUN OUT OF IDEAS 
HERE IS WHAT IS COMING AT YOU A 
LONG LIST OF NEW LAWS TO PERSUADE 
YOU THAT GORDON BROWN IS NOT 
FALLING SHORT IDEAS FOR EDUCATION 
SKILLS AND THE N. H. S. ALREADY HE HAS 
BORROWED BILLIONS TO EASE THE TAX 
BURDEN FOR MANY TODAY THE P. M. SAID 
HE FEELS EVERYONE IS PAYING 
I KNOW 
THE ECONOMIC SITUATION AS A RESULT 
OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH RISING PRICES 
AND RISING UTILITY AND FOOD BILLS 
IS CREATING UNDERSTANDABLE ANXIETY 
IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT 
THE DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT IS 
CLEAR 
FOR THAT MEANS HELPING MORE CLEAR PEOPLE BUY THEIR OWN HOMES FROM 
NOW IT WILL NOT JUST THE KEY 
WORKERS WHO CAN MAKE A CUP OF TEA 
IN A NEW FLAT BOARD WITH A SHED AT 
THE MORTGAGE ALL FIRST TIME BUYERS 
WITH A HOUSEHOLD INCOME UNDER 
SIXTY THOUSAND WILL BE ABLE TO PURCHASE 
PART OF A HOUSE EXISTING CASH WILL 
BE USED TO BUY NEW PROPERTIES TO 
BE RENTED OUT BY HOUSING 
ASSOCIATIONS THE OPPOSITION SAYS 
THESE ARE SMALL MEASURES FOR A BIG 
PROBLEM BUT THE PRIME MINISTER 
SAYS IT IS A PRIORITY 
I KNOW THAT 
FOR MOST FAMILIES THE GREATEST 
STORE OF WEALTH IS THE HOUSE AND 
THE DREAM THAT THE CHILDREN WILL 
GET ON THE HOUSING LADDER FOR 
FUTURE PROSPERITY THAT IS WHY WE 
HAVE LAUNCHED TODAY'S PACKAGE 
SCHOOL IS THAT ARE NOT UP TO 
SCRATCH AROUND THE GOVERNMENT'S 
SIDE MORE PRESSURE WILL BE PUT ON 
COUNCILS TO IMPROVE THOSE THAT ARE 
FAILING PUPILS AS WELL AS AN 
EXTENSION TO FLEXIBLE WORKING 
EVERY EMPLOYEE IS TO BE GIVEN THE 
RIGHT TO ASK FOR TIME OFF FOR 
TRAINING SAVERS WILL BE HELPED 
EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
EXTENDED ITS BORROWING AS MANY AS 
EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES 
WILL BE ABLE TO SQUIRREL AWAY 
SAVINGS THAT WILL BE MATCHED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT WITH THESE MEASURES 
GORDON BROWN WANTS TO CONVINCE THE 
ORDINARY VOTER THAT HE IS ON THE 
PUBLIC'S SIDE BUT TODAY'S ECONOMIC 
WARNINGS WILL DO LITTLE TO ENHANCE 
HIS ECONOMIC REPUTATION HAVING 
BORROWED TO GET HIMSELF OUT OF A 
HOLE ON TAX THERE WAS NO ESCAPE 
FROM THE COMMONS CRITICISM THERE THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS IN THIS 
STATEMENT THAT WE WELCOMED NOT 
LEAST BECAUSE WE PROPOSED THEM NON NON JUST A COPYCAT HE CRIED 
THE TRUTH 
IS THAT IT REVEALS THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S DEEPER PROBLEM WHEN IT 
COMES TO THE PROGRESSIVE GOALS WE 
NEED TO ACHIEVE IN THIS COUNTRY 
HIS IDEAS HAVE RUN OUT OF STEAM UP 
IF WE HAD TAKEN THE ADVICE OF THE 
CONSERVATIVES NONE OF THE MAJOR 
LEGISLATION GOING THROUGH THE HOUSE 
OF COMMONS WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH 
THE LIB DEMS DISMISSED THE PLANS 
BE SO LONG LEGISLATIVE LIST IS A 
RAGBAG OF PROPOSALS BUT HE IS 
EVETTE ADDRESSING THINGS THE 
GOVERNMENT SAID WERE NOT A PROBLEM 
LIKE THE ECONOMY OR TRY TO TURN 
AROUND PROBLEMS THE GOVERNMENT 
ITSELF CREATED 
BUT CAN THE NEW 
EFFORTS CONVINCE VOTERS GORDON 
BROWN IS EFFECTIVE WITH THE BY 
ELECTION IN CREWE IN A FEW WEEKS' 
TIME IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE HE 
FINDS OUT 
NICK ROBINSON IS IN WESTMINSTER 
WILL THIS BRIGHT NEW AGENDA WORK 
FOR GORDON BROWN AND THAT BY 
ELECTION 
I DOUBT WHETHER IN CREWE ELECTION AND NANTWICH OR ANYWHERE ELSE THEY 
WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THESE 
MEASURES DOWN THE DOG AND DUCK BUT 
THAT IS NOT TO DISPARAGE THE 
INDIVIDUAL MEASURES THERE WILL BE 
PLENTY OF THINGS VOTERS WILL 
WELCOME AFTER ALL THE OPPOSITION 
THEMSELVES WELCOME MOVES FOR 
FLEXIBLE WORKING TO IMPROVE SCHOOLS 
AND HOSPITALS THE AMBITION OF THIS 
WAS NOT TO SET OUT SOME GREAT NEW 
VISION OR AGENDA L. DO NOT THINK 
GORDON BROWN EXPECTED THAT IT WAS 
TO TAKE HOLD OF EVENTS INSTEAD OF 
BEING BATTERED AND BRUISED BY THEM 
AND WITH A BUDGET ONE DAY AND A 
QUEEN'S SPEECH THE NEXT AND A 
PRIME MINISTERIAL NEWS CONFERENCE 
TOMORROW HE WAS JUST HOPE THAT HE 
IS LOOKING IN CONTROL OF EVENTS 
AND NOT BUFFETED BY THEM 
BUT THERE 
HAS TO BE A POSSIBILITY THAT PEOPLE 
WILL REMEMBER MERVYN KING'S TO THE 
COMMONS TODAY AND NOT GORDON 
BROWN'S IDEAS 
NON JUST A 
POSSIBILITY BUT A CERTAINTY WHEN 
THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
TELLS US THE NICE DECADE IS BEHIND 
US WHEN HE WARNS OF INFLATION OF 
COURSE PEOPLE WILL WORRY GORDON 
BROWN KNOWS THAT TODAY HE TOLD US 
WHAT HIS TEST WAS FOR HIMSELF AS 
PRIME MINISTER DELIVERING 
PROSPERITY AND FAIRNESS HE KNOWS 
THAT IT IS SEATBELTS ON FOR THE 
NEXT TWELVE MONTHS PEOPLE WILL BE 
ANXIOUS AND THE BEST HE CAN HOPE 
TO DO IS TO BE SEEN TO BE IN 
CONTROL DURING THAT DIFFICULT 
PERIOD AND GETTING SOME CREDIT 
AFTERWARDS BUT AS WE KNOW THE 
VOTERS OF CREWE AND NANTWICH WILL 
HAVE A VERY BIG SAY NEXT WEEK ABOUT 
WHETHER HE LOOKS ON COURSE ALL 
TERRIBLY OF IT 
FOR FULL DETAILS OF THE MEASURES 
ANNOUNCED THIS MORNING YOU CAN GO 
TO OUR WEBSITE 
IN CHINA THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF TROOPS AND 
POLICE IT IS SENDING TO THE 
EARTHQUAKE ZONE AS THE FULL SCALE 
OF THE DISASTER BECOMES OBVIOUS 
THE DEATH TOLL IS NOW FIFTEEN THOUSAND BUT 
THAT IS BOUND TO RISE WITH ABOUT 
FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE KNOWN TO BE BURIED OR 
MISSING WITH A MASSIVE RESCUE 
OPERATION INTO ITS THIRD DAY WE 
ARE STILL GETTING PICTURES OF THE 
MOMENT THE QUAKE STRUCK LOOK AT 
THIS 
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE 
THAT WAS 
A SCENE REPEATED TIME AND TIME 
AGAIN ACROSS SICHUAN PROVINCE IN 
SOUTH WEST CHINA TODAY THERE WERE 
FEARS OF DANGEROUS CRACKS IN DAM 
UPRIVER FROM THE EARTHQUAKE HIT 
TOWN OF DUJIANGYAN AND TROOPS HAVE 
CARRIED OUT EMERGENCY REPAIRS OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IS IN THE PROVINCIAL 
CAPITAL CHENGDU 
THIS EVENING THIS COUPLE ARE 
LIVING OUT OF THEIR NEW HOUSE A 
KIND OF WITH WINE THEIR OLD HOME 
LIES ALL AROUND THEM THE MAN 
INJURED HIS FOOT BUT THE COUPLE 
ARE HAPPY TO BE ALIVE MY HUSBAND 
STRUGGLED TO ESCAPE FROM THE HOUSE 
SHE SAYS THANK GOD ONE WAS WORKING 
IN THE FIELDS IF I WAS SLEEPING 
INSIDE I WOULD BE DEAD TENS OF 
THOUSANDS IN THIS REGION ARE NOW 
LIVING THE SAME WAY THE FU AND 
CHEN FAMILY TELL ME THEY NOW LIVE 
IN A SINGLE TENT SHE AND HER 
FATHER TO THEIR HOUSE WHICH HAS 
BECOME A GREAT THEY ARE SAYING THE 
BODY OF HER MOTHER HIS WIFE IS 
STILL INSIDE THIS HOUSE IT IS 
UNDERNEATH THE RUBBLE SHE WAS 
SLEEPING IN THE HOUSE AND WAS 
UNABLE TO GET OUT WHEN THE 
EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED SHE WAS A 
LITTLE OVER SIXTY YEARS AND VERY 
POPULAR WITHIN THE VILLAGE 
OVERNIGHT AND INTO THE EARLY HOURS 
OF THE MORNING THERE HAS BEEN MORE 
RESCUE WORK SOME OF ITS DRAMATIC 
HERE RESCUERS FOUGHT TO SAVE 
CHILDREN INSIDE CAR AT SCHOOL IN 
THE TOWN OF DUJIANGYAN THEY PASSED 
WATER TO THOSE TRAPPED INSIDE SOME 
MADE IT OUT ALIVE THOUSANDS ARE 
STILL MISSING PEOPLE SEARCHING FOR 
THEIR RELATIVES HAVE RUSHED HERE TO 
A MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL IN THE HOPE OF 
FINDING THEM PEOPLE ARE REASONABLY 
DESPERATE HERE THEY ARE TRYING TO 
GET INSIDE THIS BUILDING TO FIND 
OUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEIR 
MISSING RELATIVES THEY HAVE BEEN 
TOLD THERE ARE INJURED PEOPLE 
INSIDE THEY ARE DESPERATE TO GET 
IN WE ARE LOOKING FOR MY SISTER 
AND HER FAMILY THIS MAN TELLS ME 
THERE ARE NO LISTS OF DEAD AND 
INJURED ANYWHERE HERE SO SOME 
PEOPLE WAVE THEIR OWN HANDWRITTEN 
CARDBOARD SIGNS IT IS ALL THEY CAN 
DO DO HERE A NEW SURVEY INTO THE N. H. S. HAS 
FOUND THAT NINE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE 
IN ENGLAND WHO STAY OVERNIGHT IN 
HOSPITAL ARE HAPPY WITH THEIR 
TREATMENT BUT THERE WERE 
COMPLAINTS TOO OVER THE STANDARD 
OF FOOD AND STAYING IN MIXED SEX 
WARDS THE FIGURES COME FROM AN 
ANNUAL SURVEY OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PATIENTS 
GIVING PATIENTS VOICE THIS 
SURVEY ASKED ABOUT THEIR 
EXPERIENCES IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS 
MIXED WARDS LEVELS OF CLEANLINESS 
HELP WITH FEEDING AND CALL BUTTON 
RESPONSE TIMES ALMOST A THIRD OF 
PATIENTS SAID THEY HAD TO SHARE 
BATHROOM WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX AND 
THERE WERE VARIATIONS IN THE 
NUMBERS OF MIXED WARDS ACROSS 
ENGLAND THIS HOSPITAL IS AT THE 
TOP OF THE LIST FOR SEPARATE WARDS 
AND PATIENTS VALUE THAT ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE BEEN CUT ALL THE WAY 
DOWN AND YOU ONLY HAVE A LITTLE TOP 
BECAUSE NOTHING CAN TOUCH YOU 
EVERYTHING HURTS OTHERWISE YOU 
HAVE TO WALK AROUND COVERED UP IT 
IS BETTER WITH JUST LADIES 
CLEANLINESS IS HUGE ISSUE FOR 
PATIENTS HERE AT THE 
CARDIOTHORACIC CENTRE THEY USED 
MATRONS TO HEAD UP TEAMS TO INSPECT 
TOWARDS A HYGIENE BUT NATIONALLY 
PATIENTS FEEL STANDARDS ARE FALLING 
AND THERE ARE BIG DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN TRUSTS HERE THERE ARE AT 
THE TOP OF THE TABLE FOR 
CLEANLINESS 
SO SOMETIMES IT IS NOT CLEANLINESS EASY BUT IT IS ABOUT HAVING THE 
CONVICTION AND STANDARDS AND 
MAKING SURE YOU ADHERE TO THEM AS AS SOME PATIENTS STRUGGLE TO EAT IN 
HOSPITAL AGAIN THE CARDIOTHORACIC 
CENTRE COMES TOP FOR PROVIDING HELP 
AT THE BOTTOM IS EALING HOSPITAL 
N. H. S. TRUST TO THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT SAID STAFF 
ALWAYS HELPED THEM EAT THE 
HOSPITAL ALSO HAS SOME OF THE 
HIGHEST NUMBER OF PATIENTS WANTING 
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THEIR CARE ASIDE 
FROM THE PROBLEMS MORE PEOPLE THAN 
EVER ARE GIVING THE HIGHEST 
POSSIBLE RATING TO THE CARE THEY 
RECEIVE IN HOSPITAL FORTY TWO PER CENT SAY IT 
WAS EXCELLENT AND NINETY TWO PER CENT SAY THEY 
CARE WAS GOOD OR EVEN BETTER WHEN 
PATIENTS NEED ANY HELP THEY USE 
THE CALL BUTTON THIS IS AN AREA 
WHERE SOME HOSPITALS DO WELL AND 
OTHERS DO BADLY IN SOME CASES 
PATIENTS SAY THEY NEVER RECEIVED 
ANY HELP AT ALL AFTER PRESSING THE 
BUTTON PATIENTS HERE VALUED THE 
QUICK RESPONSE 
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO 
IS PRESS THE BUZZER AND THEY ARE 
THERE I CANNOT SPEAK TOO HIGHLY OF 
IT THEY ARE WONDERFUL EACH AND 
EVERY ONE OF THEM 
NO MATTER WHAT 
YOU WANT AND THEY WILL COME JUST 
PRESS THE BUZZER AND THEY WILL 
COME 
P. C. IN THE SURVEY TOGETHER COME CREATES AN OVERALL PICTURE OF WHAT 
PATIENTS REALLY THINK ABOUT THEIR 
CARE PIECING THE SURVEY TOGETHER 
BE COMMISSION SAYS TRUSTS DOING 
BADLY MUST LISTEN 
IT IS JUST AFTER SIX FIFTEEN P. M. WITH FOOD 
AND FUEL PRICES RISING THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND WARNS THAT THE GOOD TIMES 
ARE OVER AT LEAST FOR THE TIME

HILLARY CLINTON WON THE LATEST 
PRIMARY VOTE IN THE RACE FOR THE 
DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION BUT HOW 
COMFORTABLE VICTORY IN WEST 
VIRGINIA EXPOSED BARACK OBAMA'S 
DIFFICULTY IN WINNING OVER WHITE 
WORKING CLASS PEOPLE A POLL THAT 
CLINTON VOTERS IN THE STATE FOUND 
OUT THAT A THIRD WOULD NOT BACK

IN THE ELECTION 
WEST VIRGINIA IS HILLARY CLINTON 
COUNTRY QUITE POOR VERY WHITE 
HER VICTORY HERE WAS HUGE 
I NEED 
YOUR HELP TO CONTINUE THIS JOURNEY 
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IT LOOKS 
VERY UNLIKELY SHE WILL BE THE 
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT 
NOW SO WHAT WILL THESE LOYAL 
HILARY VOTERS DO WHEN THEIR 
CANDIDATE DROPS OUT OF THE RACE IN 
WEST VIRGINIA EXIT POLLS SUGGESTED 
THAT ONLY ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THEM 
WOULD HAPPILY SWITCH THEIR SUPPORT 
TO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN 
THE US 
SHOWS A REAL PROBLEM FOR BARACK 
OBAMA THIS SHOWS THESE ARE 
WHITE WORKING CLASS DEMOCRATS WHO 
SAY THEY WILL NOT GO FOR HIM THE THE DEMOCRATS' NIGHTMARE SCENARIO IS 
THAT THE WHITE WORKING CLASS WILL 
CHOOSE FOR PRESIDENT THIS MAN JOHN 
MCCAIN THE REPUBLICAN BARACK 
OBAMA THE LIKELY DEMOCRATIC 
CANDIDATE MUST NOW CAUGHT THE 
WORKING CLASS LOOK AT HIM HERE 
PLAYING POOL IN A WEST VIRGINIA 
TOWN A HARVARD EDUCATED LAWYER 
TURNS AN ORDINARY GUY EARLY 
INDICATORS LOOK VERY GOOD FOR THE 
DEMOCRATS IN HIS PRESIDENTIAL RACE 
BUT SO MUCH CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW 
AND NOVEMBER THIS PRESIDENTIAL 
RACE OBAMA IS EMERGING AS THE 
LIKELY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE AND A 
SERIOUS CONTENDER FOR THE WHITE 
HOUSE WITH HER MA SIGNS THAT RACE 
COULD BE EMERGING THERE IS AN 
UNPREDICTABLE FACTOR IN THIS 
ELECTION WITH HIM ARE SIGNS 
THERE WILL BE A PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO 
THE DEATH OF BAHA MOUSA THE IRAQI 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST WHO DIED IN 
BRITISH ARMY CUSTODY FOUR YEARS AGO 
THE DEFENCE SECRETARY DES BROWNE 
SAID THE ARMY HAD NOTHING TO HIDE 
AND WE LEARN FROM THE INVESTIGATION 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED 
BREACHING BAHA MOUSA'S HUMAN RIGHTS 
LAST MONTH 
THE UN SAYS ANOTHER CYCLONE COULD 
BE FORMING THE BURMA LESS THAN TWO 
WEEKS AFTER CYCLONE NARGIS LEFT 
MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE DEAD OR 
MISSING A BAND OF SUMMER STORMS IS 
CAUSING TORRENTIAL RAIN OVER THE 
WORST IT'S PART OF BURMA AND 
WORSENING RELIEF EFFORTS 
WORST HIT PRESIDENT BUSH HAS 
ARRIVED IN ISRAEL TO MARK ITS SIXTIETH 
ANNIVERSARY IT IS HIS SECOND TRIP 
TO THE REGION SINCE JANUARY THE 
VISIT WILL FOCUS ON THE CURRENT 
PEACE TALKS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE 
PALESTINIANS PALESTINIANS THE QUEEN IS CONTINUING HER FIRST 
STATE VISIT TO TURKEY AND THIRTY SEVEN YEARS 
SHOWING RESPECT FOR THE COUNTRY'S 
MUSLIM HERITAGE BY DONNING A HEAD 
SCARF TO VISIT A FIFTEENTH CENTURY 
MOSQUE IN THE THIRTY SEVEN YEARS NICHOLAS 
WITCHELL SENT THIS REPORT 
CONTAINING FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY 
WE SHOULD HAVE IT 
NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE WHEN YOU GO 
ABROAD THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS 
YOU HAVE TO DO NUMBER ONE YOU 
WANT TO SEE A FEW OF THE LOCAL 
SIDES THE TROUBLE IS OF COURSE 
WHEN YOU ARE THE QUEEN YOU ARE THE 
SITE THAT THE LOCALS WANT TO SEE 
SO IT WAS IN BURSA AND OTTOMAN 
CITY WHICH HAS SEEN A FEW THINGS 
OVER THE CENTURIES BUT WHICH HAS 
NEVER HAD A VISIT BY A BRITISH 
MONARCH THE QUEEN WAS TAKEN TO THE 
SILK MARKET A CHANCE FOR SOME 
SHOPPING SHE EXAMINED THE SCARVES

SCARF WAS SELECTED NO HAGGLING 
NECESSARY THIS WAS A GIFT SAID 
THE OWNER 
THEM AFTER A FASHION SHOW WHICH 
DISPLAYED TURKEY'S STRONG WEST 
WOULD FACING INSTINCTS THIS AFTER 
ALL IS WHERE MANY OF THE GARMENTS 
ON OUR HIGH STREETS ARE MADE THERE 
WAS THE MORE SERIOUS BUSINESS FOR 
THEM AFTER 
THE QUEEN WAS TAKEN TO THE CITY'S 
HISTORIC GREEN MASK SHE WENT 
BAREFOOT SAVE FOR A PAIR OF 
SLIPPERS AND COVERED HER HEAD AS 
REQUIRED BY ISLAMIC CUSTOM IT 
CERTAINLY IS NOT THE FIRST TIME SHE 
HAS BEEN TO A MOSQUE BUT HER 
VISITS HAVE BEEN INFREQUENT BUT IN 
A COUNTRY LIKE TURKEY WHERE THE 
ISLAMIC FACES HAVING AN EVER MORE 
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S 
LIVES IT IS AN IMPORT INGESTRE 
FAITH IS HAVING THE VISIT WAS TO 
ENCOURAGE FAITH AND CO OPERATION 
BUT IT IS MORE THAN THE USUAL STUFF 
OF ECONOMICS AND TRADE IT IS ABOUT 
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE FAITHS 
AND BETWEEN ASKED EAST AND WEST
