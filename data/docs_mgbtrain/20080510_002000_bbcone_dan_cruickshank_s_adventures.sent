THE RICH WITH THE POOR WORKERS AND PROFESSIONALS 
THIS IS A JOURNEY TO SEE HOW ARCHITECTURE BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER 
HOW BUILDINGS MAKE US CONNECT 
IN INDIA AN ENORMOUS SLUM THAT BECAME A VIBRANT COMMUNITY 
BRASILIA A CAPITAL CITY THAT DREAMED OF A BRAVE NEW WORLD 
DAMASCUS THE WORLD'S OLDEST INHABITED CITY 
AND FROM NINETEEN THIRTIES NEW YORK 
THIS IS THE PLANALTO A SPECTACULAR WILDERNESS 
AT THE VERY HEART OF BRAZIL 
IT'S A PLACE WHERE NATURE STILL FEELS ALL POWERFUL 
BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY 
THIS LAND BECAME THE SITE FOR A GIANT EXPERIMENT IN CITY BUILDING 
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST AUDACIOUS 
ARCHITECTURAL PROJECTS EVER REALISED 
IT WAS CREATED AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE BELIEVED 
THAT ARCHITECTURE COULD CHANGE THE WORLD 
AND THAT ARCHITECTS COULD CURE SOCIAL EVILS 
THEY COULD TRANSFORM FOR THE BETTER THE WAY IN WHICH WE LIVE 
AND ALL WAS TO BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A PERFECT CITY DESIGNED FROM SCRATCH 
THE CITY WAS TO BE BRAZIL'S NEW CAPITAL 
THE SITE WAS REMOTE SIX HUNDRED K. M. FROM THE NEAREST PAVED ROAD 
BUT IN JUST OVER THREE YEARS IT WAS TRANSFORMED 
THEY BUILT BRASILIA 
THE CITY WAS INAUGURATED ON THE TWENTY FIRST APRIL NINETEEN SIXTY 
INTENDED AS A BOLD FRESH START FOR A COUNTRY STRICKEN 
BY POVERTY AND DISEASE 
IT WAS TO BE A NEW CAPITAL 
TO EXPRESS THE IDENTITY AND ASPIRATIONS OF A NEW NATION 
PROCLAIMING SOCIAL EQUALITY AND BELIEF IN THE FUTURE 
THESE BUILDINGS ARE ALL THE WORK OF ONE MAN 
THE GREAT BRAZILIAN ARCHITECT OSCAR NIEMEYER 
POLITICALLY A COMMUNIST ARCHITECTURALLY A MODERNIST 
HE REALISED THE GOVERNMENT'S VISION 
THROUGH SCULPTURAL BUILDINGS LIBERATED FROM STYLES OF THE PAST 
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY TO THINK 
THAT NOT ONE BUILDING IN THIS CITY IS OLDER THAN I AM 
IT'S AN INFANT IT STILL HAS SOME OF THE EXHILARATION OF YOUTH ABOUT IT 
I KNOW MOST PEOPLE AREN'T MOVED BY MODERNIST ARCHITECTURE 
BUT I THINK THIS LITTLE ELEGANT BUILDING 
COULD BRING ABOUT A FEW CONVERSIONS 
JUST OPEN YOUR MIND TO IT JUST LOOK AT IT 
IT'S THE PALACE OF JUSTICE AND THE BUILDING'S ALL TO DO WITH LIGHT 
WITH GLASS WALLS LETTING LIGHT FLOOD INSIDE 
A BEAUTIFUL SPACE TO OCCUPY AND WORK IN AND IT'S TO DO WITH LIGHTNESS 
LIGHTNESS OF THE CONSTRUCTION THE MINIMAL CONSTRUCTION 
IT'S FANTASTIC THE WHOLE THING SUPPORTED 
ON THESE REALLY ELEGANT BEAUTIFULLY SHAPED CURVED COLUMNS 
THEY BARELY TOUCH THE GROUND 
THE WHOLE BUILDING SEEMS TO FLOAT IN SPACE 
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL 
THE GREATEST ORNAMENT OF THIS BUILDING 
IS SIMPLY THE MEANS OF ITS CONSTRUCTION 
MODERNIST ARCHITECTURE HAS A REPUTATION 
FOR BEING ARID ANONYMOUS MACHINE LIKE 
BUT NOT HERE 
NIEMEYER WANTED TO CREATE AN ARCHITECTURE 
THAT REFLECTED THE NATURE OF BRAZIL AND ITS PEOPLE 
SO HE USED THE CURVE TO ECHO THE CURVE OF THE BRAZILIAN HILLS 
THE CURVE OF THE CLOUDS IN THE SKIES 
AND OF AS HE PUT IT THE FORM OF YOUR LOVER 
HE WAS PARTICULARLY TAKEN HE SAID 
BY THE CURVACEOUS BAROQUE BUTTOCKS OF BRAZILIAN BEAUTIES 
AND THAT'S THE SORT OF FORM 
THE SENSUOUS FORM HE WANTED TO PUT INTO HIS ARCHITECTURE 
THE CITY'S GREAT CENTREPIECE 
IS THE BUILDING HOUSING THE BRAZILIAN PARLIAMENT 
THIS IS VERY EXCITING 
I AM GOING ON TO THE ROOF OF THE CONGRESS BUILDING 
THE ROOF USED TO BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC 
BUT HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR DECADES 
I SUPPOSE FOR REASONS OF SECURITY AND HEALTH AND SAFETY 
SO I AM VERY PRIVILEGED 
I AM ABOUT TO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE 
THAT IS NOW DENIED CITIZENS OF BRAZIL 
HERE WE ARE GOSH IT'S WONDERFUL 
IT'S STRANGELY ANTIQUE ALMOST SPIRITUAL REALLY 
UP HERE IS LIKE BEING ON TOP OF AN ACROPOLIS LIKE IN ATHENS 
AND THE RAMPS LIKE THE RAMPS OF EGYPTIAN TEMPLES 
IT'S AN AMAZING MARRIAGE REALLY OF OLD AND NEW 
OF MATERIALISTIC AND SPIRITUAL CREATING A GOVERNMENT BUILDING 
THAT'S ALSO IN A WAY A SACRED BUILDING 
THE HEART OF THE NATION 
WHAT'S SURPRISING FOR ME IS THAT IN A CITY CONCEIVED BY COMMUNISTS 
RISES ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST SPIRITUALLY CHARGED CATHEDRALS 
A DARK PASSAGE TAKES YOU DOWN INTO THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH 
INTO A GROTTO INTO A TOMB 
BUT YOU GET HERE AND SUDDENLY THERE'S AN EXPLOSION OF LIGHT 
THIS IS OF COURSE TO DO WITH REBIRTH RESURRECTION 
THE TOMB BECOMES THE WOMB 
ALL THIS IS A BIT OBVIOUSLY CHRISTIAN ISN'T IT 
CHRIST'S TOMB RESURRECTION AND THE FORM OF THE BUILDING 
THE GREAT CONCRETE ARCHES ARE LIKE THE CROWN OF THORNS 
BUT NIEMEYER WAS AN ATHEIST WHICH MAKES IT AMAZING ODD AT LEAST 
THAT HE WOULD DESIGN SUCH A POWERFUL CHRISTIAN CATHEDRAL 
BUT THAT OF COURSE IS TO MISS THE POINT 
THIS IS NOT JUST TO DO WITH CHRISTIANITY 
IT WAS A FUSION OF THE BELIEFS OF THE PEOPLE OF BRAZIL 
ROMAN CATHOLICS OLDER RELIGIONS RELIGIONS BROUGHT HERE FROM AFRICA 
A FANTASTIC MONUMENT TO THE NATURE OF THE NATION OF BRAZIL 
BUT TO COMPREHEND THE SCALE OF BRASILIA'S AMBITION 
TO SEE HOW IT EMBRACES THE MODERN AGE 
REQUIRES A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE 
BRASILIA LOOKS FANTASTIC FROM THE AIR LOOKING DOWN 
IT'S LIKE A GREAT ARCHITECT'S MODEL 
EVERYTHING ORDERED IN ITS PLACE EVERYTHING'S DESIGNED 
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL THE ARCHITECT ALWAYS WANTED IT 
TO BE SEEN FROM A FEW HUNDRED METRES UP 
IT'S BEEN LAID OUT IN THE SHAPE OF AN AEROPLANE WITH SWEPT BACK WINGS 
IT'S CLEARLY DIVIDED INTO ZONES ACCORDING TO USE 
A MODERNIST HALLMARK 
I'M NOW RUNNING NEXT TO THE FUSELAGE OF THE AEROPLANE SO TO SPEAK 
A CENTRAL MONUMENTAL AXIS ALONG WHICH ARE SET 
THE GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS THE MINISTRIES 
THAT OF COURSE IS WHERE THE PILOT WOULD BE 
THE CONGRESS THE GOVERNMENT 
WHERE THE WINGS MEET THE MAIN AXIS 
WHERE THE ENGINES WOULD BE SO TO SPEAK IS THE COMMERCIAL AREA 
COMMERCE OFFICES DRIVING THE CITY FANTASTIC SYMBOLISM 
AND BELOW ME ON THE CURVE OF THE WINGS ARE THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS 
THESE ARE HOUSING SLABS SET IN PARKLAND 
IT'S REALLY RATHER WONDERFUL ACTUALLY A GREAT SCULPTURAL CITY 
BRASILIA'S RESIDENTIAL AREAS WERE PLANNED WITH GREAT CARE 
TO CREATE A NEW CLASSLESS WORLD 
BLOCKS WERE LIMITED TO THE HEIGHT FROM WHICH 
MOTHERS COULD HEAR THEIR CHILDREN PLAYING BELOW 
AND APARTMENTS WERE TO BE DISTRIBUTED 
RIGHT ACROSS THE SOCIAL SPECTRUM 
GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND LABOURERS LIVING SIDE BY SIDE 
THIS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO BE CONSTRUCTED 
HELLO 
AND DONA OLGA HAS BEEN HERE FROM THE START 
VERY GOOD SO I'VE COME TO SEE YOUR LOVELY HOME 
THERE'S A PAINTING 
YES LITTLE FINGER COMES OUT 
SHE MOVED TO BRASILIA 
WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS ELECTED AS A STATE DEPUTY 
DID YOU FEEL YOU WERE ON THE CUTTING EDGE 
OF A NEW WAY OF LIVING IN CITIES 
WOULD YOU EVER MOVE 
BUT BRASILIA WAS THE VICTIM OF A CHANGING WORLD 
BRAZIL'S SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT FELL 
AND THE EGALITARIAN VISION OF THE CITY WAS ABANDONED 
THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR OPENED UP ONCE AGAIN 
DONA FRANCISCO WORKS AS A CLEANER AT THE MINISTRY OF URBAN PLANNING 
BUT SHE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITY 
LIKE THOUSANDS OF BRASILIA'S LOW PAID WORKERS 
SHE LIVES ON ITS DISTANT OUTSKIRTS 
SPENDING THREE HOURS A DAY ON A BUS TO AND FROM WORK 
SHE HAS AN EXTRA WEEKEND JOB TO MAKE ENDS MEET 
AND WHAT LITTLE TIME SHE HAS AT HOME SHE SPENDS HERE 
IN ONE OF BRASILIA'S SATELLITE TOWNS 
THEY ARE THE CITY'S ALTER EGO UNINTENDED DISORGANISED AND POOR 
WHAT'S LIFE LIKE HERE 
IS IT INCONVENIENT IS IT DANGEROUS EVEN 
WHAT CONNECTION DO YOU FEEL TO BRASILIA 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO BRASILIA IF THE SATELLITE TOWNS DIDN'T EXIST 
BRASILIA'S A MODERNIST DREAM ARCHITECTURALLY STUNNING 
IT WAS TO SHOW HOW PEOPLE SHOULD LIVE TOGETHER 
THE RICH WITH THE POOR WORKERS AND PROFESSIONALS 
BUT NOW I'VE BEEN TO THE SATELLITE TOWN 
IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS DREAM HAS FAILED 
AND THE WORKERS REALLY HAVE BEEN BETRAYED 
THIS IS DAMASCUS THE CAPITAL OF SYRIA 
AT THE HEART OF THE MIDDLE EAST 
DAMASCUS IS THE OLDEST CONTINUOUSLY INHABITED CITY ON EARTH 
PERHAPS SEVEN THOUSAND YEARS OLD 
WHILE THE ONCE GREAT AND ANCIENT CITIES LIKE PERSEPOLIS 
BABYLON AND JERICHO ARE NOW NOTHING BUT RUINS OR SHRUNKEN VILLAGES 
DAMASCUS IS ALIVE AND WELL THRIVING 
I FIND IT INTOXICATING BECAUSE IT APPEALS TO THE SENSES 
IT INFLAMES FEEDS THE BRAIN AND MOVES THE SPIRIT 
TO WALK THE STREETS OF DAMASCUS 
IS TO SEE WHAT MAKES IT SO SUCCESSFUL AND ENDURING 
FROM ITS EARLIEST DAYS THE CITY HAS BEEN A CENTRE OF TRADE 
BETWEEN EAST AND WEST 
AND IT'S TRADE THAT HAS KEPT THE CITY A LIVING BEING 
THIS IS THE OLDEST STREET OF TRADE IN DAMASCUS IT'S STRAIGHT STREET 
THE DECUMANUS MAXIMUS OF ROMAN TIMES 
ORIGINALLY IT WAS FOUR TIMES THIS WIDTH WITH COLUMNS ON EACH SIDE 
AND BEHIND THE COLUMNS SHOPS SELLING THE TRADE GOODS 
THE WEALTH AND WONDERS OF THE EMPIRE 
THE CITY'S TRADITION OF TRADE IS REVEALED BY ITS WONDERFUL FOOD 
IT'S EMBLEMATIC OF DAMASCUS 
THE MARKETS ARE LADEN WITH HERBS AND SPICES 
FROM ALL OVER THE MIDDLE EAST 
VERY GOOD 
AND SHARING FOOD IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF DAMASCUS LIFE 
IT BRINGS THE PEOPLE TOGETHER AND MAKES THEM FEEL PART OF THE CITY 
OH NUTS NUTS LOVELY 
ALL FROM SYRIA CAFE 
OH WELL O. K. LOVELY DIDN'T EXPECT THAT 
COME TO TO BUY SOME NUTS AND I GET SOME LOVELY COFFEE 
THESE ARE ALL NUTS FROM SYRIA 
TOASTED AND ROASTED WHAT'S THAT 
SALT SALT OF COURSE SALTED PEANUTS VERY HOT YES 
IT'S A GOOD JOKE VERY HOT 
UP THERE LOOK ENDLESS BAGS OF NUTS STORED 
AN INCREDIBLE SCENE AN ALADDIN'S CAVE OF NUTS 
DAMASCUS NUTS IT SAYS 
PUMPKIN SEED YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT 
THE CONSTANT COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES 
MEANS THAT SOME OF DAMASCUS'S FINEST AND MOST ANCIENT ARCHITECTURE 
IS DEVOTED TO TRADE 
A LARGE NUMBER OF KHANS SURVIVE IN THE OLD CITY 
A KHAN IS A WAREHOUSE 
WHICH ALSO INCLUDED ACCOMMODATION OFFICES FOR MERCHANTS 
MOSTLY LIKE THIS ONE THEY ARE APPROACHED 
THROUGH A BIG ARCH OFF A MAJOR COMMERCIAL STREET 
GENERALLY ARCHITECTURALLY WONDERFUL LIKE THIS ONE 
THIS ONE WAS BUILT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO I'M TOLD 
AND WAS HOME TO TOBACCO MERCHANTS 
THREE DOMES IN A ROW WITH THE SKY OPEN IN THE MIDDLE 
THE SKY WORKING LIKE A SORT OF ORNAMENTAL CEILING 
AMAZING SORT OF LITTLE PALACE OF TRADE 
THE MOST MAGNIFICENT KHAN IS THE AS'AD PASHA 
BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY TWO IT'S A STUNNING PIECE OF GEOMETRY 
AND AS FINE AS ANY MOSQUE IN THE CITY 
ALONG THE TRADE ROUTES LEADING TO DAMASCUS 
TRAVELLED IDEAS ART AND RELIGION BUT RATHER THAN DIVIDING THE CITY 
DIFFERENT RELIGIONS AND PEOPLE 
WERE ABSORBED TO ENRICH THE CULTURE OF DAMASCUS 
THIS SITE'S BEEN THE SACRED HEART THE SOUL OF DAMASCUS 
FOR AT LEAST THREE THOUSAND YEARS 
VARIOUS CONQUERORS BROUGHT THEIR GODS WITH THEM 
AND RESHAPED THE BUILDING TO SUIT THEIR NEEDS 
THIS PORTICO HERE THESE COLUMNS AND THAT WONDERFUL WALL IN FRONT OF ME 
DATE FROM THE SECOND CENTURY AD 
AND ARE THE REMAINS OF THE ROMAN TEMPLE OF JUPITER 
THIS BUILDING SHOWS HOW DAMASCUS HAS SURVIVED 
THROUGH ITS ABILITY TO ADAPT 
IN THE FOURTH CENTURY THE PAGAN TEMPLE WAS CONVERTED 
INTO A CHRISTIAN CATHEDRAL 
AND WHEN THE MUSLIMS CONQUERED DAMASCUS IN SIX HUNDRED THIRTY SIX 
THEY SHARED THE BUILDING WITH THEIR CHRISTIAN NEIGHBOURS 
FOR NEARLY A CENTURY 
THIS COURT'S A FANTASTIC ARCHITECTURAL SPACE 
BUT INCREDIBLY IT'S ONLY A SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELF 
ORIGINALLY ALL THESE SURFACES WERE COVERED WITH MOSAIC 
IMAGINE IT GOLD GLISTENING IN THE SUN 
THEY WERE EXECUTED IN THE EIGHTH CENTURY 
BUT SOME OF THE MOSAIC DOES SURVIVE 
IT'S BEHIND ME HERE IN THIS COLONNADE NOW RATHER FADED 
IT SHOWS I SUPPOSE DAMASCUS IN THE EIGHTH CENTURY 
THERE'S THE RIVER BARADA FULL OF WATER 
TREES PLANTS LITTLE HOUSES 
PALACES MOSQUES AN IMAGE OF PARADISE 
THE MUSLIMS REBUILT WITHIN THE ANCIENT WALLS IN SEVEN HUNDRED FIVE 
TO CREATE THE GREATEST MOSQUE IN THE WORLD 
BUT THEY DIDN'T JUST SWEEP THE PAST AWAY 
INSIDE ARE ROWS OF CORINTHIAN COLUMNS FROM THE CATHEDRAL 
THE MEMORY OF THE OLD BUILDING WAS KEPT ALIVE 
IN THIS VAST MUSLIM PRAYER HALL 
AND THIS HISTORIC STRUCTURE IS STILL A LIVING PLACE OF WORSHIP 
I LOVE THIS MOSQUE IT IS WARM WELCOMING 
A SENSE OF CALM A SENSE OF PEACE 
PEOPLE COME HERE TO CONTEMPLATE TO PRAY OF COURSE 
FAMILIES WANDER AROUND A WONDERFUL ATMOSPHERE 
TERRIFIC CARPETS EVERYWHERE 
AND THE SOUNDS SOUNDS OF TELEPHONES 
CHANTING PEOPLE JUST GOING ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIFE 
VERY VERY REASSURING 
CAN'T HELP BUT SITTING HERE AND FEELING 
THAT WITHIN THESE ANCIENT WALLS 
STILL RESIDES THE SOUL OF THE ANCIENT CITY OF DAMASCUS 
AND DAMASCUS HAS SURVIVED AND PROSPERED 
BECAUSE PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS FAITHS 
FOUND A WAY OF LIVING TOGETHER 
SO THE CITY WAS DIVIDED INTO SEPARATE AREAS 
EACH HOME TO A TRADE OR RELIGIOUS GROUP 
SO THERE'D BE A MUSLIM QUARTER 
A CHRISTIAN QUARTER A JEWISH QUARTER 
AND EACH OF THESE GROUPS WOULD FEEL SECURE 
IN THEIR MAZE OF STREETS 
WITH THEIR GATES AND THOSE FORTIFIED TOWER ENTRIES 
THE PLACE WOULD BE UTTERLY CONFUSING TO UNWELCOME STRANGERS 
THE MOST MAGNIFICENT HOUSES HAVE SIMPLE 
ALMOST NONDESCRIPT EXTERIORS 
I'M ON WAY TO MEET HIND KABAWAT 
ONE OF THE RESIDENTS IN THE CHRISTIAN QUARTER 
OH YES 
HELLO HI HOW ARE YOU WELCOME 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS MUST BE YOUR WONDERFUL HOME 
LOVELY LITTLE ENTRANCE WITH MARBLE 
SHALL I GO IN HERE AAH HOW LOVELY 
GLAD TO HAVE YOU IN OUR HOUSE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE BROUGHT A GIFT FOR YOU 
YOU DON'T HAVE YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I DO APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
SOMETHING MAYBE FOR US TO NIBBLE AT AS WE CHAT LATER 
NOW I HOPE 
FANTASTIC BEAUTIFUL WITH THE FOUNTAIN 
TYPICAL OF THESE COURTYARD HOUSES 
YES THIS IS WHERE WE SIT IN THE AFTERNOON AND THE EVENING 
IN THE SPRING AND THE FALL 
AND WE USUALLY SPEND THE SUMMER HERE IN THE COURTYARD 
ESPECIALLY IN THE EVENING IT IS VERY COOL HERE 
AND THE TEMPERATURE IS VERY REFRESHING AND VERY NICE 
THE SMELL OF THE COURTYARD THE VISUALS 
AND THE SOUND OF THE FOUNTAIN MUST BE WONDERFUL 
BIRDSONG SOUNDS THE SENSES ALL THE SENSES ENGAGED 
BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURE BUT YOU SAY IN HERE THIS IS WHERE YOU 
YEAH LET'S GO AND SEE 
GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE 
OH AH SO IT'S WARMER HERE RIGHT 
IT'S AN INTERIOR SORT OF POOL FOUNTAIN 
I SUPPOSE IT'S OTTOMAN PERIOD SO IT'S EIGHTEENTH CENTURY I GUESS 
I LOVE THE BLACK AND WHITE STONEWORK 
AND ALL THESE ARCHES RECESSES BEAUTIFUL 
YOU SEE MY SWEET FRIEND THIS IS THE DEEDS 
THE DEEDS TO THE HOUSE 
YES THIS IS THE ORIGINAL ONE FROM THE OTTOMAN TIMES 
OH GOOD HEAVENS TO YOUR FAMILY YES 
SO YOUR FAMILY'S BEEN HERE SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS IN THAT CASE 
TELL ME ABOUT LIVING IN DAMASCUS I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL 
THE ATMOSPHERE IS SO PEACEFUL AND FRIENDLY TOLERANT 
VERY VERY PLEASING PLACE 
IT IS A VERY TOLERANT PLACE 
A CHRISTIAN FAMILY WE'VE LIVED HERE FOR A FEW HUNDRED YEARS 
WE HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS 
OUR SHI ITE OR SUNNIS FRIENDS WE DON'T EVEN KNOW 
WE'RE JUST LIKE FRIENDS AND WE HAVE BEEN LIVING HERE FOR EVER 
IT'S BEEN GREAT 
HERE'S A CALL TO PRAYER FROM THE MOSQUE NEARBY 
EXACTLY AND SUNDAY YOU HEAR ALL THE CHURCHES ALSO 
YOU HAVE THE JEWISH AREA HERE WE ARE SO CLOSE 
AND WE ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY 
IT'S A VERY TOLERANT CAPITAL BEAUTIFUL COSMOPOLITAN 
IT'S VERY SORT OF EXCITING ISN'T IT 
THE MOST ANCIENT CITY ON EARTH SHOULD ALSO BE ONE OF THE MOST 
I SUPPOSE HARMONIOUS THE MOST MODEL OF HOW CITIES OUGHT TO BE 
A LESSON FROM THE PAST APPLIED TO THE PRESENT AND FUTURE ISN'T IT 
EXACTLY EXACTLY 
THE MIRACLE OF DAMASCUS 
IS ITS STRONG SENSE OF HISTORY AND IDENTITY 
AN IDENTITY THAT DOES NOT DEPEND ON ONE CULTURE OR RELIGION 
AND ONE WAY THE PAST IS KEPT ALIVE 
IS THROUGH THE TRADITION OF STORY TELLING 
VERY GOOD VERY GOOD 
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE TO THINK THAT DAMASCUS WAS ANCIENT 
WHEN ROME BECAME A POWER IN THE LAND 
WAS OLD WHEN THE PHARAOHS RULED IN EGYPT 
THE CITY'S HAD A TURBULENT HISTORY 
ATTACKED BY THE CHRISTIAN CRUSADERS IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
PILLAGED HORRIBLY BY TAMERLAINE AND HIS MONGOLS IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED ONE 
BUT IT SURVIVED IT'S SEEN EMPIRES AND TYRANTS COME AND GO 
IT OFFERS A FANTASTIC OBJECT LESSON 
IN HOW PEOPLE CAN LIVE TOGETHER CREATIVELY AND IN HARMONY 
IT'S A WONDERFUL CITY IN WHICH TO BE 
THIS IS NEW YORK CITY THE STUNNING CITY OF TOWERS 
THE SKYSCRAPER THE BUILDING OF THE MODERN AGE 
HAS BEEN WITH US FOR JUST OVER A CENTURY 
EVER SINCE WE LEARNED HOW TO BUILD HUGE METAL FRAMES 
TO CARRY THE MASSIVE LOADS 
THE SKYSCRAPER TRANSFORMED THE WAY CITIES ARE BUILT 
AND THE WAY THEY ARE LIVED IN FOR GOOD AND FOR ILL 
FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS THEY HAVE HAD THEIR ENEMIES 
BUT THE CITY HIGH RISE IS HERE TO STAY 
GETTING ITS DESIGN RIGHT IS VITAL 
IF WE'RE TO LIVE IN HARMONY ON THIS OVERCROWDED PLANET 
IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN 
THERE'S ONE SKYSCRAPER THAT HAS LONG INTRIGUED ME 
THE SOARING TOWER OF THE ROCKEFELLER CENTRE 
IT'S PART OF A VISION OF A BETTER WAY OF LIVING AND WORKING 
IN A CROWDED MODERN CITY 
THE TOWER IS STAGGERINGLY TALL AND SLENDER 
THE SETBACKS THE SMALL SECTIONS CUT INTO LIKE STEPS 
GIVE THE TOWER AN ABSTRACT SCULPTURAL QUALITY 
ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS WIDE FROM THE SIDE 
FROM THE FRONT IT'S ALMOST BLADE LIKE 
IT HAS A CUBIST MACHINE LIKE BEAUTY 
IT'S REACHING FOR THE FUTURE 
A FAMILY OF THIRTEEN BUILDINGS FRAME THE MAIN TOWER 
OCCUPYING TWENTY TWO ACRES OF THE CITY 
THE TOWER CONTAINS OFFICES 
BUT THIS IS NO MUNDANE PLACE OF WORK 
GOOD AFTERNOON MR. CRUICKSHANK 
OH EXCELLENT YOU WERE EXPECTING ME 
WELCOME TO ROCKEFELLER CENTRE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WHAT A FANTASTIC PLACE IT LOOKS TO WORK ISN'T IT IT SURE IS 
THE TOWER STARTED IN NINETEEN THIRTY ONE 
AND THE LOBBY'S A SENSATIONAL EXAMPLE OF ART DECO 
THE MATERIALS AND DETAILS ARE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY VERY TACTILE 
THIS REALLY IS A SPECTACULAR AND MAGNIFICENT SPACE 
IT'S NOT JUST THE ENTRANCE TO A PRIVATE SET OF OFFICES 
IT'S ALSO A PUBLIC THOROUGHFARE FULL OF SHOPS 
IT'S PART OF THE CITY AND IT'S FULL OF INSPIRING ART 
OVER THERE IS A MURAL SHOWING AMERICAN PROGRESS 
THE MARRIAGE OF BRAWN AND BRAIN 
IN THE CENTRE A RENDERING OF ROCKEFELLER TOWER ITSELF 
IT'S ALL VERY IDEALISTIC 
AND THAT'S A CLUE TO THE STORY OF THIS BUILDING 
WHICH IS ALL TO DO WITH VISION AND COURAGE 
THE CENTRE WAS BUILT ON THE FORTUNE OF A GREAT DYNASTY 
JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER FOUNDED THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY 
MAKING HIM THE RICHEST MAN IN AMERICA 
HIS SON HAD PLANNED TO CONCENTRATE ON PHILANTHROPIC WORKS 
BUT A SPECTACULAR PIECE OF BAD TIMING LEFT HIM STUCK 
WITH A HUGE PLOT OF LAND IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE 
JUST AS AMERICA WAS DEVASTATED BY THE WALL STREET CRASH 
PANIC GAVE WAY TO DESPAIR 
OVERNIGHT THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAD SPAWNED BREAD LINES 
SOUP KITCHENS AND APPLE SELLERS' 
ROCKEFELLER JUNIOR WAS LEFT FACING LOSSES OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR 
FACED WITH FINANCIAL DISASTER 
HE PUT FORWARD WHAT SEEMED TO MANY AN INSANE PLAN 
IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SLUMP 
ROCKEFELLER PROPOSED A GIANT DEVELOPMENT 
OF OFFICES SHOPS AND THEATRES 
THE WORK IN THE MIDST OF CATASTROPHIC UNEMPLOYMENT 
WHEN FORTY THOUSAND MEN ON THE GREATEST REAL ESTATE ENTERPRISE 
EVER UNDERTAKEN BY PRIVATE CAPITAL 
THE ONLY OUTSTANDING BUILDING PROJECT IN DEPRESSION TIME NEW YORK 
FROM THE EARLY THIRTIES THE SEVENTY STOREY TOWER ROSE RAPIDLY 
THE PIONEERING CONSTRUCTION COMBINED WITH SPECIALLY COMMISSIONED ART 
ROCKEFELLER'S GAMBLE PAID OFF 
MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WORK IN ROCKEFELLER CENTRE 
IN EVERYTHING FROM A BROADCASTING COMPANY 
TO AIRLINES AND AN AUCTION HOUSE 
HELLO HELLO MR. CRUICKSHANK I WILL CALL MR. GERARD FOR YOU NOW 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU 
I'M CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THE TOWER WORKS AS AN OFFICE 
IS ITS STRANGE NARROW SHAPE A PROBLEM 
TO FIND OUT I'VE COME TO MEET A PARTNER IN A CORPORATE LAW FIRM 
WHO HAS WORKED HERE FOR TWENTY YEARS' 
ONE OF OUR PARTNERS WHO I AM GOING TO INTERRUPT HERE 
DAN COME IN PLEASE THIS IS LAURA FRIEDRICH HELLO 
HI HOW ARE YOU VERY WELL NICE TO MEET YOU 
GOOD TO MEET YOU SORRY TO TAKE YOU AWAY FROM YOUR WORK 
NO NO LOVELY LIGHT OFFICE 
YES THEY ALWAYS NOTICE THE LIGHT IN THIS OFFICE 
BECAUSE THE BUILDING IS SO NARROW THAT YOU HAVE LIGHT ON BOTH SIDES 
AND IT'S VERY PLEASANT I PRESUME 
MARIAN BALDWIN DAN CRUICKSHANK 
HOW DO YOU DO NICE TO MEET YOU NICE TO MEET YOU 
THIS IS NOT AN EFFICIENT USE OF SPACE BUT EVERYONE HAS AN EXTERIOR OFFICE 
THERE IS REALLY NO CORE EXCEPT FOR THE ELEVATORS 
AND I GUESS THE ONLY THING WITHOUT WINDOWS ARE THE WASHROOMS 
NOW THESE ARE TWO OF OUR ASSOCIATES ONE OF WHOM IS ON THE TELEPHONE 
NICE TO MEET YOU SO TWO IN A ROOM EH I SEE 
HOW DO YOU SORT OUT WHO GETS THE WINDOW HERE 
WHOEVER'S HERE FIRST 
THIS IS WHERE MY WIFE WOULD SAY I LIVE 
BUT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS MY OFFICE 
NICE HOME YOU'VE GOT IT'S A CORNER OFFICE HOW LOVELY 
YES IT IS A CORNER OFFICE 
AND EVERYBODY LIKES TO HAVE A CORNER OFFICE 
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE OF THE SETBACKS HERE AT ROCKEFELLER CENTRE 
THERE ARE EIGHT CORNERS ON EVERY FLOOR 
SO I HAVE A VERY NICE CORNER OFFICE 
THERE IS ANOTHER CORNER JUST UP THERE 
SO WITH EIGHT PER FLOOR AND NINE FLOORS YOU HAVE SEVENTY TWO HAPPY PARTNERS 
INTERESTING CAN I SEE THE VIEW YOU'VE GOT IT LOOKS TERRIFIC 
YES OF COURSE THE CURTAIN'S HERE 
ALTHOUGH I DON'T GET A LOT OF TIME TO STAND HERE AND LOOK 
THAT IS SAINT PATRICK'S CATHEDRAL ON THE LEFT 
AND JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF FIFTH AVENUE YES 
IT ISN'T JUST THE DESIGN THAT MAKES THE ROCKEFELLER SO LOVED 
THIS IS A BUILDING THAT'S ALWAYS INVITED PEOPLE IN 
IT'S PART OF THE CITY 
AND NOW NEARLY ONE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE PASS THROUGH THE CENTRE EACH YEAR 
IT'S HARD NOW TO IMAGINE IT BUT ONE HUNDRED OR SO YEARS AGO 
ALL THIS WAS A EUROPEAN STYLE LOW RISE CITY 
AND WHEN THE FIRST SKYSCRAPERS STARTED TO APPEAR 
THEY WERE VIEWED WITH A DEEP SUSPICION 
THE SUCCESS OF THE ROCKEFELLER 
SHOWED THAT SKYSCRAPERS DIDN'T HAVE TO BE OBJECTS OF FEAR 
BUT COULD ENRICH PEOPLE'S LIVES 
THE ROCKEFELLER CENTRE OCCUPIES SEVERAL CITY BLOCKS 
AND WITHIN ITS DOMAIN STRIVES TO CREATE 
A MORE PERFECT VISION OF THE CITY 
AND LOOK THERE ARE THESE INCREDIBLE DETAILS 
HERE IS THIS GRILLE AROUND THE TREE 
WONDERFUL ART DECO PIECE OF WORK 
IT BRINGS AN AMAZING QUALITY TO THE AREA 
A REALLY CIVIC QUALITY 
MARKS IT ALL OUT AS BEING ROCKEFELLER TERRITORY 
CONFIRMS THIS PLACE REALLY IS A CITY WITHIN THE CITY 
HERE ART ABOUNDS AS INTENDED 
TO LIFT THE SPIRITS AND PROCLAIM THE WONDER OF THE MODERN AGE 
AND BELOW GROUND THERE ARE RESTAURANTS AND SHOPS 
A PIONEERING IDEA BACK IN THE THIRTIES 
IT WAS ONCE SAID YOU COULD DO ANYTHING HERE 
EXCEPT SLEEP PRAY AND NOT PAY RENT 
I'VE NEVER HAD SUCH A GOOD BUFFING WHAT A SHINE IT'S A WORK OF ART 
VISITORS FLOCK TO THE ROCKEFELLER IN THEIR MILLIONS 
BUT WHAT DO NEW YORKERS THEMSELVES THINK 
JUST LOOK AROUND IT'S STUNNING 
THE GLUE THAT HOLDS MIDTOWN TOGETHER 
IT'S THE GREATEST PLACE ON EARTH IT'S TALL AND SHINY 
SPLENDID IT'S LIKE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO CHEW 
DO YOU LIKE THIS BUILDING YES 
THAT'S A LANDMARK 
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN DO I LIKE ROCKEFELLER CENTRE 
UNLIKE MOST OFFICE BLOCKS THE ROCKEFELLER IS STILL FULL OF LIFE 
LONG AFTER THE WORKERS HAVE GONE HOME 
KEEP YOUR ARMS OUT OH NO 
NO MAN YOU CAN DO THAT YES 
IF I FALL ON MY BACK I KNOW ONE THING 
I'LL GET A SPLENDID VIEW OF THE TOWER 
AT THE TOP SITS ROCKEFELLER'S RAINBOW ROOM AND GRILL 
WHERE PEOPLE COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
TO DRINK IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF NEW YORK 
HIGH RISE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN MUCH CRITICISED 
BUT THE ROCKEFELLER CENTRE IS THE MODEL OF HOW IT OUGHT TO BE DONE 
IT COMBINES PRIVATE PROFITS WITH PUBLIC BENEFITS 
UTILITY WITH BEAUTY 
IT'S A SOLUTION TO MODERN CITY LIVING NOT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS 
FOR ME THIS IS THE MOST PERFECT SKYSCRAPER IN THE WORLD 
SUNRISE OVER THE ROOFTOPS OF AN IMMENSE SHANTY TOWN 
ON THE WEST COAST OF INDIA 
THIS IS DHARAVI IN MUMBAI HOME TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
AND NOTORIOUS AS THE LARGEST SLUM IN ASIA 
I FIND THIS PLACE ABSOLUTELY RIVETING 
HERE IN ITS ORGANIC FORMS YOU CAN SEE THE ORIGIN OF CITIES 
YOU CAN SEE HOW PEOPLE LIVING AND WORKING IN EXTREME CONDITIONS 
CREATE THEIR OWN ARCHITECTURE 
HERE IN DHARAVI YOU CAN SENSE HOW MOST MAJOR CITIES WERE BORN 
LITTLE HAS BEEN PLANNED 
THIS IS ORGANIC GROWTH ARCHITECTURE WITHOUT ARCHITECTS 
THE PEOPLE HAVE CREATED THE BUILDINGS THEY NEED TO SURVIVE 
DHARAVI WAS BUILT IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
BUT IT TELLS A MUCH OLDER STORY 
IT SPEAKS OF THE WAY PEOPLE CREATE COMMUNITIES 
HOW WE LEARN TO LIVE TOGETHER 
IT'S INCREDIBLE IT'S LIKE BEING IN A MEDIEVAL EUROPEAN CITY 
NARROW ALLEYS DOWN THERE LOOKING INTO DIFFERENT HOMES 
PEOPLE GETTING DRESSED READY TO GO TO WORK 
AND HERE THERE ARE OVERHANGS ON THE FIRST FLOOR LIKE TUDOR JETTIES 
HELLO HELLO 
AND JUST LIKE A MEDIEVAL TOWN DHARAVI HAS LACKED BASIC SANITATION 
MEANING THAT DISEASES LIKE CHOLERA ARE RIFE DURING THE MONSOON SEASON 
IT WAS ONLY IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THAT THE STATE GOVERNMENT MOVED 
TO IMPROVE THE APPALLING CONDITIONS HERE 
BUILDING A HANDFUL OF LATRINE BLOCKS AND COMMUNAL TAPS 
BUT THERE ARE STILL MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE TO EVERY LATRINE 
AND LESS THAN THIRTY PER CENT OF DHARAVI HAS SEWERS 
THE DESPERATE NATURE OF LIVING IN DHARAVI 
HAS STIMULATED THE PEOPLE TO FLIGHTS OF CREATIVE EXUBERANCE 
THE RESIDENTS BUILD THEIR HOMES FROM WHATEVER COMES TO HAND 
USING TARPAULIN SCRAP TIMBER AND BITS OF CORRUGATED METAL 
ADDING BRICKS WHEN THEY CAN AFFORD IT 
DHARAVI CONTAINS SOME OF THE MOST INVENTIVE PIECES OF ARCHITECTURE 
I'VE EVER SEEN 
I LOVE THIS BRILLIANT DO IT YOURSELF 
AD HOC ARCHITECTURE USING CHEAP AND AVAILABLE MATERIALS 
LOOK THAT SHUTTER'S A FRIDGE DOOR 
AH HELLO 
THE FAMILY THAT LIVES HERE HAS VERY KINDLY SAID 
I CAN HAVE A LOOK AROUND INSIDE 
HELLO 
THIS IS THE MAIN ROOM OF THE HOUSE 
I'M TOLD SIX PEOPLE LIVE AND SLEEP IN HERE 
HERE'S THE BEDDING AND EVERYWHERE BEAUTIFUL BRIGHT COLOURS 
AND HERE IS A SHRINE TO SHIVA WITH FAMILY PORTRAITS ALL ROUND IT 
AND HERE IS THE KITCHEN 
EVERYTHING IS VERY ORDERLY 
VERY ARRANGED VERY CLEAN WONDERFUL 
THE STORY OF DHARAVI BEGAN OVER SEVENTY YEARS AGO 
WHEN THE GREAT DEPRESSION GRIPPED INDIA 
AND RURAL WORKERS MIGRATED FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE TO THE CITIES 
THEY WERE DRIVEN OUT OF THE COUNTRYSIDE BY POVERTY BY DROUGHT 
THEY CAME TO THE CITY TO MAKE A LIVING TO SURVIVE 
WHEN THEY GOT TO MUMBAI 
THE AUTHORITIES DIDN'T ALLOW THEM TO SETTLE IN THE CENTRE 
INSTEAD THEY HAD TO LIVE ON THE EDGE OF TOWN 
WHERE NOBODY ELSE WITH MONEY WANTED TO DWELL 
THREE HUNDRED FAMILIES FROM GUJARAT WERE AMONG THE FIRST TO ARRIVE 
AND THE FRAGILE ECONOMY OF DHARAVI WAS BORN 
WHEN THEY BUILT KILNS AND BEGAN A POTTERY 
IT IS A TESTAMENT TO THEIR DETERMINATION AND RESOURCEFULNESS 
THAT FOR FIVE GENERATIONS POTTERS HAVE THRIVED IN DHARAVI 
WITH THEIR WARES NOW EVEN BEING EXPORTED ABROAD 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE 
WHAT WAS DHARAVI LIKE THEN 
WHAT'S YOUR EARLIEST MEMORY OF THIS AREA 
WERE YOU A POTTER FROM THE START 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME VERY KIND AND GOOD LUCK 
OVER THE DECADES DHARAVI GREW 
AND EACH GROUP THAT ARRIVED FORMED ITS OWN DISTINCTIVE SETTLEMENT 
THIS IS WHERE THE VALMIKI COMMUNITY LIVES 
THEY ARE ORIGINALLY FROM NORTH INDIA 
AND THEY ARE SWEEPERS BY TRADE 
THIS COMMUNITY HAS GROWN ON THIS SITE FROM THE EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES 
SOME FAMILIES CAME HERE INVITED THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES 
TO JOIN THEM AND THE COMMUNITY GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER 
I THINK MANY OF THE PEOPLE WOULD RATHER BE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
BUT THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THERE'S NO WORK THERE 
THIS IS THE MAIN TEMPLE THE HINDU I AM GOING TO GO INSIDE 
THANK YOU THANK YOU 
COMMUNITIES COME HERE TO WORK 
TO TRY AND BUILD A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES 
THERE'S VERY LITTLE UNEMPLOYMENT IN DHARAVI 
THE IRONY IS THAT THESE PEOPLE PROVIDE 
MUCH OF MUMBAI'S LABOUR AND INDUSTRY 
BUT THE CITY WHICH COULDN'T FUNCTION WITHOUT DHARAVI 
DOES LITTLE TO SUSTAIN LIFE HERE 
THERE ARE SOME PRETTY NASTY AND HAZARDOUS INDUSTRIES 
LOCATED IN DHARAVI MOST OF THESE SEEM TO BE TO DO WITH RECYCLING 
ALL MANNER OF THINGS BEING RECYCLED HERE MOSTLY I THINK PLASTIC 
ALL THIS IS UNREGULATED BY THE CITY BUT THEN OF COURSE 
MUMBAI DOES LIKE DHARAVI TO DO THE CITY'S DIRTY WORK FOR IT 
AND ALL THIS INDUSTRY HAS ALLOWED SOME OF THE OLDER GENERATION 
TO BUILD UP RESERVES OF MONEY TO INVEST IN THEIR COMMUNITIES 
I WAS IN FOR A FEW SURPRISES' 
HERE'S A SCHOOL FOR THE TAMIL COMMUNITY 
AND HERE THE CHILDREN ARE HAVING A LESSON 
VERY BOISTEROUS VERY SMART HELLO 
HI HI BRILLIANT 
AND NEXT DOOR IS A HINDU TEMPLE 
SO SCHOOL AND TEMPLE UNIFIED IN ONE BUILDING 
REALLY THIS COMMUNITY IS DOING VERY WELL THERE'S MONEY HERE 
AND THESE BRILLIANT SCHOLARS I'M SURE WILL GO A LONG WAY 
THERE'S A FEELING OF PRIDE AND IDENTITY IN THE STREETS OF DHARAVI 
WITH SOME BUILDINGS THAT CREATE A REAL SENSE OF COMMUNITY 
GOLLY A HEALTH CLUB BHARAT MATA MOTHER INDIA 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK INSIDE 
HELLO CHAPS 
WELL WELL WELL 
I REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE A GYM IN DHARAVI 
ALL THESE FELLOWS FINE FELLOWS THEY ARE TOO WORKING OUT 
VERY MUSCLY TYPE OVER THERE 
VERY WELL ORGANISED AND GOOD EQUIPMENT 
GUY HERE'S DOING SOME SORT OF LIFT UP VERY GOOD 
ADMIRABLE 
DHARAVI'S NOT THE SORT OF CHAOTIC SQUALID SLUM I IMAGINED 
INDEED IT'S NOT REALLY A SLUM AT ALL IN MANY SENSES 
THERE'S POVERTY HERE BUT THERE'S ORDER CLEANLINESS 
EVERYONE'S NOW WASHING THEIR CLOTHES 
MORNING 
THE HOUSES ARE IN REASONABLE CONDITION WELL DECORATED 
THERE'S ORNAMENTATION LOVELY LITTLE SACRED TREE HERE 
THERE IS AN UNDERLYING ORDER NOT APPARENT AT FIRST TO OUTSIDERS 
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES DIFFERENT TRADES GATHERED TOGETHER 
AND ALL SORTS OF USES MIXED TOGETHER 
TO MAKE A VERY SORT OF BALANCED COMMUNITY 
A COMMUNITY EASY TO LIVE IN 
FOR EXAMPLE HERE'S A SORT OF CORNER SHOP HELLO 
EXCELLENT SUPPLY OF SWEETS FOR THE CHILDREN 
IN THE PAST DHARAVI WAS REGARDED AS AN ILLEGAL SLUM 
AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT RISK OF DEMOLITION BY THE AUTHORITIES 
AND NOW THAT THE LAND VALUE OF THE AREA IS ENORMOUS 
THE CITY IS PROPOSING A RADICAL REDEVELOPMENT 
POOR IT MAY BE BUT DHARAVI IS FIGHTING BACK 
ALL THIS IS PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE 
THEY ARE NOT TAKING LOAN FROM THE BANK 
THE BANK IS NOT GIVING MONEY 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT GIVEN A GRANT 
NOT A SINGLE ONE INCH STRUCTURE HAS BEEN BUILT BY THE GOVERNMENT 
THAT'S A CENTRAL POINT 
I MEAN WALKING ROUND DHARAVI LOOKING 
I MEAN SLUM IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD IT IS NOT A SLUM IS IT 
IT'S VERY ORGANISED DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES 
PEOPLE ARE POOR BUT THEY MAINTAIN THEIR STREETS 
THEIR HOUSES EVERYTHING'S CLEANED AND SO ON 
AND THERE'S LOTS OF INDUSTRY GOING ON 
PEOPLE HAVE CREATED THIS FOR THEMSELVES 
THEIR OWN ENTERPRISE THEIR OWN ENERGY THEIR OWN MONEY 
I WONDER WHAT CONTRIBUTION THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE REALLY 
EXACTLY THAT'S WHAT WE ARE QUESTIONING 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE NOTHING 
WELL THAT'S SHOCKING SINCE THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE 
MAKE SUCH AN OBVIOUS CONTRIBUTION TO THE CITY 
THE CITY SHOULD MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THEM 
BUT THE CITY IS SUCKING THE BLOOD FROM YOU 
THE ECONOMY IS RULING THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING 
THE WHOLE LAND VALUE HAS GONE SKY HIGH 
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FUTURE WILL BE 
THE GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO BULLDOZE IT 
BULLDOZE YEAH YEAH BULLDOZE IT SO IT IS NOT EASY 
SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND IT'S GOING TO BE A WAR 
IF AT ALL EVEN THE BULLDOZERS COME NEAR IT WILL BE A WAR 
TO VISIT DHARAVI IS LIKE STEPPING BACK IN TIME 
TO WITNESS THE ORIGIN OF CITIES 
OF THE WAY PEOPLE FIRST LEARNED TO LIVE TOGETHER 
BUT IF DHARAVI IS TO EVOLVE CREATIVELY IN THE MODERN WORLD 
THEN ITS RESIDENTS MUST BE LISTENED TO 
DHARAVI HAS SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED ME 
THIS IS A PLACE OF WARMTH AND WELCOME 
HERE A MULTITUDE OF DIVERSE PEOPLES 
HAVE THROUGH THEIR ENERGY AND ENTERPRISE 
AND AGAINST ALL THE ODDS CREATED A VIABLE AND VIBRANT COMMUNITY 
A COMMUNITY WHICH DOES MUCH TO SERVE THE GREAT CITY OF MUMBAI 
BUT WHICH SHAMEFULLY MUMBAI HAS DONE VERY LITTLE TO HELP 
THIS MAY BE A PLACE OF ECONOMIC POVERTY 
THERE'S NO POVERTY OF THE SPIRIT HERE NO POVERTY OF THE SOUL
