BROUGHT ABOUT A GLOBAL IMPACT 
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THE TRIAL 
RICHARD 
IT IS EXTRAORDINARY ILY RICHARD SIGNIFICANT THEY ARE ALL PLEADING 
NOT GUILTY TO THE CHARGES IF THE 
TRIAL GOES AHEAD THEY ARE GUILTY 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SEVEN PLANES 
TALKING ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT 
COULD HAVE DIED IN THE EXPLOSIONS 
OVER THE ATLANTIC AND OVER NORTH 
AMERICA COMPARED WITH THE CREVICE 
TRIAL THE BOMB PLOT TRIAL OF TWO THOUSAND SIX 
IT IS OF THAT SORT OF ORDER OF 
MAGNITUDE HERE WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT MANY MANY MORE POTENTIAL 
DEATHS IF THIS IS PROOFEN TO BE A 
PLOT OF COURSE 
AS YOU SAY THE MEN DENY THE 
CHARGES

HAD TWO OF THE KEY INDIVIDUALS 
UNDER SURVEILLANCE ON THE NIGHT OF 
AUGUST TWO THOUSAND SIX THE POLICE MOVED IN 
THEY SAY TO SEEMY AN ATTACK ABOUT

THE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT IS 
THAT THIS VERY MUCH IS A SPRING OF 
TERROR TRIALS THRFPLT ARE A NUMBER 
OF MAJOR LEAGUE TRIALS ALL ABOUT TO 
START AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE THE 
PEOPLE ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN 
WRECKYING THE SEVEN SEVENTHS BOMBINGS WE HAVE

METROPOLITAN POLICE YES YES SURVEILLANCE IS TO FEATURE IN THIS 
TRIAL AGAIN 
THANK YOU 
THERE HAS BEEN SECURITY CLAMPDOWN 
IN PARTS OF ZIMBABWE THIS EVENING 
AFTER THE SENSE OF SUSPENSION IN 
THE COUNTRY SINCE THE ELECTIONS 
LAST WEEKEND THE DEADLINE FOR A 
NOUNSING THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE 
EXPIRES TOMORROW IT COULD SIGNAL 
THE END OF ROBERT MUGABE'S TWENTY EIGHT YEAR 
OLD INCREASINGLY DESPOTIC AND RUE 
NEWS NOW RULE HE APPEARED TODAY 
FOR THE FIRST TIME ON STATE 
TELEVISION AND SPOKE OF POWER 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE RULING 
ZANU P. F. HAS LOST ITS PARLIAMENTARY 
MAJORITY AND THE MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE ARE CLAIMING 
VICTORY TOO THE B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM 
FILMING IN ZIMBABWE JOHN SIMPSON 
JOINS ME LIVE NOW 
JOHN WHAT IS THE SITUATION THERE 
TONIGHT 
IT IS VERY CONFUSED I TONIGHT HAVE TO SAY LOTS OF RUMOURS ARE 
ABUNDING PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE 
TENSION OF THE WHOLE SITUATION I 
THINK BUT IT NEVERTHELESS IS 
REALLY GETTING QUITE KPRAJ RATED 
WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE HAPPENED IS THAT 
THE RIOT POLICE MOVED IN ON A 
PARTICULAR HOTEL ON THE EDGE OF THE 
CENTRAL PART OF HARARE WHERE I AM 
THE THEY ARRESTED SEVERAL MEMBERS 
OF AN AMERICAN FUNDED ORGANISATION 
WHICH HAS BEEN HELPING THE M. D. C. 
COUNT THE VOTES AND THE IDEA 
PRESUMABLY IS TO ASSOCIATE THEM 
WITH SOME SORT OF I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT C. I. A. PLOT OR SOMETHING AGAINST 
MUGABE'S ZIMBABWE IN ORDER 
IMAGINE TO INFLUENCE THE VOTERS IF 
THERE IS A RUN OFF IN THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TWO 
JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED 
THERE HAVE BEEN ALL SORTS OF OTHER 
STORIES ABOUT HOW THE ENTIRE 
LEADERSHIP OF THE M. D. C. HAS HAD TO GO 
UNDER GROUND L. SPOKE TO THE 
SPOKESMAN FOR MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
THE LEADER OF THE M. D. C. WHO SAID NOT 
ONLY WAS IT NOT TRUE THAT MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI HAD GONE UNDERGROUND AND 
BUT NOBODY ELSE HAD GONE 
UNDERGROUND STORIES THAT THE M. D. C. 
OFFICES WERE RAIDED APPARENTLY 
THEY ARE NOT TRUE L. SAY 
APPARENTLY TAS IS DIFFICULT TO 
FIND OUT THESE THINGS HERE BUT 
STILL A REAL ATMOSPHERE OF 
NERVOUSNESS THAT IS THE KEY THING 
TO IT ALL 
SO TOMORROW THE POSSIBILITY 
POSSIBILITY OF A VOTE FINALLY AND 
ALSO A POLITBURO MEETING 
YES I 
WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT 
ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION MUST BE 
ANNOUNCED SIX DAYS AFTER THE 
ELECTION WELL IT DOES BUT IS 
THAT SIX CALENDAR DAYS OR SIX 
WORKING DAYS THAT COULD TAKE US 
THROUGH TO NEXT WEEK DOES ANYBODY 
CARE ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION OR 
DOES MUGABE CARE ABOUT IT ALL OF 
THOSE QUESTIONS ARE UNANSWERED 
MAYBE TOMORROW NIGHT WE WILL HAVE A 
RESULT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T THINK 
ANYBODY ELSE DOES MORE IMPORTANTLY 
THE POLITBURO THERE CAN'T BE MANY 
LEFT IN THE WORLD THERE IS 
CERTAINLY ONE HERE ZANU P. F. HAS ONE 
THAT IS TO MEET ROBERT MUGABE WILL 
BE CHAIRING IT L. SPOKE TO A SENIOR 
ZANU P. F. MAN TODAY HE SAID THAT HE 
THOUGHT THAT EVERYBODY THERE WOULD 
BE THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE AND 
WONDERING WHETHER THEY OUGHT TO BE 
JUMPING SHIP HE SAID SHOULD THEY 
KEEP THEIR EGGS IN ONE BASKET BUT 
IT MEANS THE SAME THING EVERYBODY 
THERE IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT 
ROBERT MUGABE THINKING IS HE GOING 
TO BE HERE IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME 
AND SHOULD WE LOOK FOR SOMEWHERE 
ELSE TO GO 
SO WHAT IS THE MOOD 
WITHIN THE COUNTRY R. T. E.'S RICHARD 
DOWNS HAS SPENT MUCH OF THE LAST 
FEW YEARS INSIDE OF ZIMBABWE HE 
HAS SPENT HIS TIME FINDING OUT WHAT 
THE VOTERS 
ARE THINKING 
THE VOTERS ARE THINKING AND HOW THE OPPOSITION 
HAS GOTTEN THEIR 
STRATEGY 
A WEEK OF WATCHING AND WEIGHT 
HEIGHTENED EXPECTATIONS AS TO WHAT 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WOULD SAY AFTER 
DAYS OF SILENT WOULD HE CLAIM 
VICTORY OR WOULD HE FIDGET 
WE ARE 
ABOVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
REQUIREMENT BUT OF COURSE 
OTHERS MAY THINK 
OTHERWISE AS FAR AS WE ARE 
CONCERNED WE WAIT UNTIL THE FINAL 
TALLY DO YOU MEAN YOU BELIEVE IN 
THE PARTY THAT YOU BELIEVE YOU 
HAVE FIFTY PER CENT 
EXACTLY ABSOLUTELY BUT 
WE CANNOT STAND HERE AND CLAIM THAT 
UNLESS WE ARE CONFIRMED BY THE BODY 
THAT IS SUPPOSED TO CONFIRM THE 
RESULT RESULT IS ARE YOU CLAIMING AS A PARTY YOU 
ARE WON THE ELECTION YES YES IT IS CLEAR THAT THE M. D. C. ARE TRYING 
TO CHANGE THEIR IMAGE FROM PARTY OF PROTEST TO PARTY OF GOVERNMENT 
IN PREVIOUS ELECTIONS THE M. D. C. FELL 
APART AS THE RULING PARTY UNDERMIND 
THEIR VOTE 
THIS TIME IT'S DIFFERENT 
IN THE 
PAST TWO THREE ELECTIONS THEY HAD 
LENT NOT TO TRUST THE LEARNT NOT 
TO TRUST THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
BUT TO RUN THEIR OWN PARALLEL 
SYSTEM THEY HAD MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND 
LAPTOP COMPUTERS THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY THEY HAD MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND 
CELL PHONES YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY THEY WERE GETTING YOU 
KNOW BLOW BY BLOW YOU KNOW 
REPORTS ON THE SITUATION AT 
INDIVIDUAL POLLING STATIONS SO 
THAT THEY WOULD KNOW WELL BEFORE 
BEFORE THE LEBT RA COMMISSION KNEW 
WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
THEY WOULD THEN RESPOND OR REACT 
ACCORDLY 
WHILE THE MANOEUVRING ACCORDLY WENT ON IN HIGH PLACE ZIMBABWEANS 
WERE LEFT IN A STATE OF SUSPENDED 
ANIMATION THIS IS RUSH HOUR INTO 
ONE OF THE MAIN HIGHWAYS OF THE 
CITY THE LOW ACTIVITY COULD BE 
DOWN TO THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY 
AND ANXIETY OVER THE STATE OF THE 
ELECTION THE CURRENCY CONTINUES 
ITS FREE FALL AND PRICES CONTINUE 
TO CLIMB ECONOMISTS ARE FINDING IT 
HARD TO KEEP UP 
WE HAVE OUTPUT 
PROBABLY DOWN FORTY PER CENT OVER THE LAST 
SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS LIVING 
STANDARDS NOW ARE PROBABLY WHERE 
THEY ARE IN THE EARLY MID NINETEEN SIXTIES FOR 
THE AVERAGE PERSON WITH INFLATION 
WHERE IT IS WE DON'T KNOW BUT WE 
WOULD SAY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS PERCENT THE 
AVERAGE PERSON IS REALLY STRUGGLING 
THE ECONOMY WILL NOT TURN AROUND 
UNLESS THERE IS A RESOLUTION TO THE 
POLITICAL CRISIS IN THE ABSENCE OF 
HARD INFORMATION THE OPPOSITION 
DECIDED TO SEIZE THE MOMENTUM 
PUTTING THEIR TALI OF THE RESULTS 
ON THE TABLE 
AN INDEPENDENT 
CREDIBLE BOARD USING METHODS THAT 
HAVE BEEN TRIED AND TESTED 
ELSEWHERE HAVE CONFIRMED WHAT WE 
ALREADY KNOW WHAT WE ARE 
CONFIRMING NAMELY THAT MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI IS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF 
THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE 
IT'S PART 
A STRATEGY TO WRONG FOOT ROBERT 
MUGABE TIME WILL TELL WHETHER IT 
WILL WORK IT HASN'T HAD THE 
GOVERNMENT RESPONDING AT ANY SENIOR 
LEVEL SO FAR THE FOCUS HAS SHIFTED 
FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO THE MILITARY 
WHICH ROBERT MUGABE HAS 
TRADITIONALLY BEEN ABLE TO COUNT ON 
FOR ROCK SOLID SUPPORT BUT ALL IS 
NOT WHAT IT SEEMS AMID TALKS OF 
COUPS AND PART OF THE ARMY PREPARED 
TO TAKE TO THE STREETS IN SUPPORT 
OF THE ZANU P. F. LEADER WE SPOKE TO 
ONE MIDDLE RANKING OFFICE WE ARE 
ACCESS TO THE CORRIDORS OF POW 
WHORE TOLD US OF SCHEMING AND 
PLOTTING AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL THEY THEY ARE BY TRYING ALL MEANS THEY ARE 
HAVING MARATHON MEETINGS IN TRYING 
TO REVERSE THE PROCESS SO I APPEAL 
TO ALL ZIMBABWEANS TO REMAIN CALM 
AND VIGILANT L. APPEAL TO ALL 
JUNIORS WITHIN THE ZIMBABWEAN 
DEFENCE FORCES TO ENSURE THEY 
EXERCISE MAXIMUM VIGILANCE BECAUSE 
THEY ARE THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE 
WHO WANT TO CAUSE HAVOC IN ORDER TO 
PROMOTE THEIR OWN INTERESTS ONE ONE THING THE TOP BRASS IN THE MILITARY 
HAVE WHICH ORDINARY PEOPLE DON'T IS 
ACCESS TO MONEY AND HARD CURRENCY 
FOR MILLIONS OF ZIMBABWEANS THIS IS 
THE DAILY GRIND POWER CUTS AND 
FUEL SHORT AIPBLS MEAN THAT THE DAY 
OF COOKING ON ELECTRIC STOVES ARE 
ALL BUT A VAGUE MEMORY REDUCED TO 
ABJECT POVERTY BY THE COLLAPSE OF 
THE ECONOMY THIS FAMILY DOES THE 
BEST THEY CAN BY THEIR CHILDREN 
EVER MINDFUL OF A MORE STABLE AND 
FRUITFUL PAST 
I'M JUST HAVING PROBLEMS I'M 
STRUGGLING TO LOOK AFTER TO 
FINANCE THEM AND THEN WHATEVER I'M 
JUST SAYING NOW THAT THINGS ARE 
HARD 
IT IS FAMILIES LIKE THIS THAT HARD VOTED FOR POLITICAL CHANGE WHAT OF 
THE MAN AT THE CENTRE OF IT ALL 
ROBERT MUGABE SOME REPORTS SAY 
HE'S DEEPLY DEPRESSED BY THE 
OUTCOME UNABLE TO COME TO TERMS 
WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND HIM 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
INDEPENDENCE HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO 
RELY ON A PARLIAMENT THE 
OPPOSITION NOW CONTROLS THE LOUER 
HOUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME MUGABE 
HAS LOST DOZENS OF HIS MOST TRUSTED 
LIEUTENANTS ON THE FLOOR OF THE 
HOUSE ALL DICTATORS SEEM TO COME 
TO A STICKY END THE AFRICAN ONES 
SEEM TO CLING ON LONGER THAN MOST 
THE LIST IS LONG AND NOT US A 
SPISHIOUS FOR THE LEADER 
IT ALES DANGEROUS TO UNDERESTIMATE 
ORL SECOND GUESS ROBERT MUGABE 
WOULD WOULD I BE ON THE TENTH FLOOR 
OF A HOTEL BUILDING THAN ON THE 
STREETS OF HARARE THE MAN STILL 
HAS POWER SOMETHING HAS CHANGED 
SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT YOU CAN 
ALMOST FEEL IT ROBERT MUGABE IS 
CERTAINLY DOWN BUT IS HE FINALLY 
OUT THIS MAN SAYS HISTORY WILL 
TREAT MUGABE HARSHLY 
HIS POLICIES 
HAVE BEEN ASTROSHUS HE HAS FAILED 
TO YOU KNOW BRING ABOUT ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT HE IS OF THE 
UNFORTUNATE SOCIALIST SCHOOL OF 
THOUGHT WHICH SAYS BECAUSE I'M 
PRESIDENT THEREFORE I'M RIGHT 
BECAUSE I'M RIGHT YOU SIT DOWN AND 
SHUT UP 
CAN YOU SEE THE DAY WHERE 
WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT PRESIDENT 
TSVANGIRAI 
YES YES IF HE IS THE TSVANGIRAI PEOPLES' CHOICE HE IS ENTITLED TO 
O. K. PIE STATE HOUSE AND TO HAVE YOU 
KNOW A GO AT RUNNING THIS COUNTRY 
HOPEFULLY TURN IT AROUND AND FUT 
BACK ON THE RAILS AGAIN 
IF THERE 
WAS A BETTING MARKET IN ZIMBABWE 
THE ODDS WOULD BE IN FAVOUR OF A 
RUN OFF BETWEEN PRESIDENT MUGABE 
AND MORGAN TSVANGIRAI BUT AS THEY 
MAKE THEIR WAY HOME THROUGH THE 
COOL HARARE NIGHT IN WHATEVER WAY 
THEY CAN ZIMBABWEANS HAVE LITTLE 
TIME FOR GAMBLING THEIR FOCUS IS 
ON SURVIVAL AND ON PRESERVING WHAT 
LITTLE HOPE THEY VFPLT I'M JOINED 
NOW IN THE PHONE BY PROFESSOR 
JONATHAN MOYO AN INDEPENDENT M. P. AND 
FORMER INFORMATION MINISTER UNDER 
ROBERT MUGABE HE IS IN HARARE 
FIRST OF ALL WHAT HAVE MUGABE'S 
PEOPLE BEEN DOING OVER THE PAST 
COUPLE OF DAYS 
SORRY SHES I DID 
NOT HEAR THAT 
WHAT HAVE ROBERT 
MUGABE'S PEOPLE BEEN DOING OVER THE 
PAST COUPLE OF DAYS 
WELL I MEAN 
EVERYONE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR THE 
OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF RESULTS 
WHICH ACTUALLY WERE KNOWN AS OF 
MIDNIGHT SUNDAY AFTER THE ELECTION 
THIS HAS CAUSED QUITE SOME ANXIETY 
AND HAS UNSETTLED THE NATION BUT WE 
EXPECTED THE RESULTS TO FINALLY 
COME OUT AT LEAST THE PRESIDENTAL 
RESULT THAT IS TO COME OUT 
TOMORROW 
AS FORMER INFORMATION TOMORROW MINUTE OF ZANUE F. F. P. F. YOU ARE 
USED THESE MEETINGS WHAT WILL THE 
ATMOSPHERE BE LIKE IN THERE WHAT 
DO YOU THINK THEY WILL BE TALKING 
ABOUT 
IT WILL BE A MEETING LIKE NO ABOUT OTHER BEFORE BECAUSE IT TAKES PLACE 
AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF AN 
ELECTION RESULT THAT HAS BEEN 
DEVASTATING TO THE RULING PARTY 
ALREADY THE RULING PARTY HAS LOST 
ITS MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT 
EVERYBODY KNOWS THE PRESIDENT LOST 
THE PRESIDENTAL ELECTION ALTHOUGH 
THE WINNER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI DID 
NOT GET SUFFICIENT VOTES TO WIN 
OUTRIGHTLY THERE SHOULD BE I MEAN 
THERE SHOULD BE A RUN OFF IN TERMS 
OF THE LAW 
SO THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT THIS AND 
WONDERING HOW IT HAPPENED ALTHOUGH 
THEY SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING 
THEY ARE RUMOURS IN HARARE THAT IT 
MAY BE THE MEETING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WILL USE TO INDICATE THE 
BEGINNING OF HIS DEPARTURE 
IF THAT 
IS THE CASE OR INDEED IF IT ISN'T 
THE CASE WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW WHO 
WOULD ROBERT MUGABE ACTUALLY LISTEN 
TO WOULD HE LISTEN TO THABO MBEKI 
OR SOMEONE ELSE WITHIN HIS OWN 
COUNTRY 
NO OBVIOUSLY ALTHOUGH COUNTRY THIS MIGHT BE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE 
TO UNDERSTAND HE WILL LISTEN TO 
THE VOTERS 
THE OTHER PEOPLE WHETHER IT BE 
THABO MBEKI OR ANY OTHER AFRICAN 
LEADER MAY ADVICE HIM IN TERMS OF 
HOW AT ADVISE HIM IN TERMS OF 
HOW HE SHOULD STRIKE HIS DEPARTURE 
IF HE DECIDES NOT TO GO THROUGH 
WITH THE RUN OFF 
I BELIEVE THAT FROM WHAT WE KNOW 
ABOUT HIM SHES HE'S A VERY STUBBORN 
POLITICIAN HE BELIEVES IN HIMSELF 
HE STILL BELIEVES HE'S POPULAR HE 
WILL HAVE AN EXPLANATION TO HIS 
DEFEAT IN THIS FIRST ROUND L. 
BELIEVE HE WILL WANT TO FIGHT TO 
THE LAST MINUTE AND WILL WANT TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE RUN OFF WHICH 
HE BELIEVES HE CAN WIN 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH 
TONIGHT ON NEWSNIGHT SCOTLAND FROM 
BEAR STEARNS TO BERS DEN WHY THE 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CRISIS 
MEANS YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET A 
MORTGAGE WHY IF YOU 
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IT 
WILL REMOVE THE SETTLEMENTS BUT IN 
THE NORTHERN WEST BANK EFFORTS TO 
REMOVE SETTLERS ARE PROVING 
INEFFECTUAL TIM FRANKS HAS HAD A 
INEFFECTUAL TIM FRANKS HAS HAD A UNIQUE ACCESS TO ONE DAY'S EVENTS 
IN AN OUTPOST ON THE WEST BANK 
THIS IS LAND ALMOST ALL GOVERNMENTS 
BELIEVE SHOULD BE PART OF A FUTURE 
PALESTINIAN STATE BUT IT IS BEING 
BUILT ON BY ISRAELI JEWS IT IS AN 
OUTPOST INSIDE THE OCCUPIED 
TERRITORY OF THE WEST BANK THE 
SETTLERS HAVE NAMED IT RETURN OF 
MY PEOPLE THE OUTPOST HAS BEEN 
EVACUATED TEN TIMES IN THE SIX 
MONTHS SINCE IT WAS FIRST OCCUPIED 
YESTERDAY CAME ATTEMPT NUMBER ELEVEN 
ISRAELI POLICEMEN AND SOLDIERS 
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED OF THEM BUNDLED SIX 
TEENAGE GIRLS ON TO BUSES AND AWAY 
WHAT IS UNUSUAL ABOUT THIS 
EVACUATION SO FAR IS THAT JUST AN 
HANDFUL OF TEENAGE GIRLS HAVE BEEN 
KICKED OUT OF THE OUTPOST THE 
TEENAGE BOYS WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED 
IN SETTING THIS UP ARE NOWHERE TO 
BE SEEN THEY MAY BE HIDING 
WAITING TO COME BACK IN ONCE THE 
ARMY AND POLICE HAVE LEFT BUT AT 
THE MOMENT THERE IS NO TRACE OF 
THEM WE HAD OUR ANSWER SOON ENOUGH 
THEY HAD BEEN KEEPING OUT OF THE 
WAY WITHIN ONE HOUR THE YOUNG 
MALE ISRAELI SETTLERS WERE BACK 
JUST THREE SOLDIERS HAD BEEN LEFT 
TO GUARD THE LAND THEY COULD NOT 
COPE 
GOD GAVE US THIS LAND IT IS COPE OURS WE DO WHAT GOD SAYS SO WE 
ARE HERE 
AS FAR AS THE POLICE AND 
SOLDIERS ARE CONCERNED THEY SAY 
YOU WERE TRESPASSING ON PRIVATELY 
OWNED PALESTINIAN LAND 
THEY CAN 
SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT WE HAVE OUR 
GOOD WHO TELLS US WHAT TO DO IF 
THEY DON'T HAVE A GOOD IT IS A BIG 
PROBLEM 
WE HAD MET HIM BEFORE PROBLEM HARD AT WORK ON THE OUTPOST IN 
FEBRUARY THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED 
ILLEGAL OUTPOSTS THROUGHOUT THE 
WEST BANK MOST ARE BIGGER AND 
LONGER ESTABLISHED THEM THIS THE 
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER EHUD OLMERT 
CALLS THEM A DISGRACE BUT THEY 
REMAIN IN PLACE 
THIS IS THE 
SYNAGOGUE 
THE AMBITION OF THOSE IN SYNAGOGUE THE OUTPOSTS AND THOSE WHO SUPPORT 
THEM IS THAT THEY EXPAND INTO 
FULL BLOWN SETTLEMENTS STILL 
ILLEGAL UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW BUT 
ACCEPTED BY THE ISRAELI AUTHORITIES 
IT DOES NOT LOOK MUCH NOW BUT IN 
THE BEGINNING THAT LOOKED EXACTLY 
THE SAME EVEN WORSE WHAT WE HOPE 
IS TO START LIKE THIS AND THEN IT 
WILL BE LIKE THAT 
THIS PLACE OVER 
HERE WAS AS ROUGH AS THIS EVEN EVEN WORSE NOW THERE ARE FAMILIES AND 
GRANDCHILDREN AND EVERYTHING IT IS 
A TOWN JUST A PLAIN TOWN BUT BUT WITHIN SIGHT OF THE OUTPOST STANDS 
A SMALL HURDLE TO THAT AMBITION 
SHE IS A SIXTY ONE YEAR OLD PALESTINIAN 
WIDOW SHE SAYS SHE OWNS THE LAND 
AND HER CASE HAS BEEN TAKEN UP BY 
AN ISRAELI HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP THIS 
IS THE HOUSE WHERE MY BROTHERS AND 
I SLEPT MY FATHER BROTHERS AND 
SISTERS WE FARMED OLIVES AND 
GROUPS GROUPS A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ISRAELI CIVIL 
ADMINISTRATION WHICH OVERSEES THE 
WEST BANK TOLD NEWSNIGHT IT IS 
ALMOST ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SURE THAT HER CLAIM TO 
THE LAND IS VALID AND IT IS ON HER 
BEHALF THAT YESTERDAY THERE WAS A 
NEW DEVELOPMENT A SMALL GROUP OF 
LEFT WING ISRAELI ACTIVIST IT'S 
TURNED UP IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON 
THEY WERE THERE THEY SAID AT THE 
INVITATION OF THE PALESTINIAN 
LANDOWNER 
WE ARE HOPING THAT OUR LANDOWNER PRESENCE HERE WILL BE USED FOR TO 
HELP PALESTINIANS HOLD ON TO THEIR 
PROPERTY IT FRIGHTENING THE PROPERTY THE SETTLERS ARE LITTLE THREATENING IT 
IS HARD TO PREDICT WHAT THEY ARE 
GOING TO DO THERE ARE MANY OF THEM 
AND WE WERE JUST HOPE FOR THE BEST 
THE PLAN WAS UNPRECEDENTED TO 
CREATE THE WEST BANK'S FIRST LEFT 
WING OUTPOST THAT AT LEAST WAS 
THE PLAN FIRST CAME THE ARGUMENTS 
ONE OF THE SETTLER LEADERS FACE TO 
FACE WITH ONE OF THE ACTIVIST SAID 
TRAITORS SHE CALLS THEM AND THEN 
WITH A LOCAL PALESTINIAN MAN 
RETURNING HE SAID TO HIS FAMILY 
LAND YOU ARE NOT AFTER OUR 
NEIGHBOURHOODS ROUND HERE SHE SAYS 
ARAFAT AND ABU MAZEN DO NOT WANT 
PLACES HERE THEY WANT TEL AVIV AND 
JERUSALEM THE EXTREME ARABS WANT 
US TO BE IN THE SEA THAT IS ALL 
THE ARGUMENT SPREAD THE SETTLERS 
HAD REINFORCEMENTS IT DID NOT LAST 
LONG LONG 
WHAT DID THEY COME HERE FOR WHAT 
IS THEIR INTEREST IN COMING HERE 
THEY SAVE THE LAND BELONGS TO THE 
PALESTINIANS 
THE LAND HAS NEVER PALESTINIANS BELONGED TO THE PALESTINIANS THE 
CONCEPT NEVER EXISTED THREE THOUSAND YEARS 
AGO THEY WERE PHILISTINES LONG 
GONE THEY DON'T EXIST ANY MORE 
THEY NEVER HAVE EXISTED THESE 
ARABS ARE THE SAME ARABS LIVING IN 
EGYPT JORDAN IRAQ THE SAME 
PEOPLE 
THEY GO TO VISIT THEIR PEOPLE FAMILIES THERE 
THE SETTLERS 
QUICKLY RECLAIMED THE OUTPOST THE 
LEFT WING ACTIVISTS AND THE 
PALESTINIANS FROM THE NEARBY 
VILLAGE HAD HIGH HOPES FOR TODAY 
INSTEAD THEY ENDED UP BEING CHASED 
OFF THE HILL AND THE SETTLERS ARE 
BACK HERE IN FORCE THEY SAY THEY 
ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE INDEED 
THEY SAY THAT THIS LAND WILL REMAIN 
THEIRS FOREVER IT MAY ONLY BE ONE 
SMALL HILL IN THE WEST BANK IT 
SHOWS HOW FAR AWAY AN END TO ALL 
THIS REMAINS 
COMING UP 
PROTEST AS TONY BLAIR SPEAKS OUT ON 
FAITH AND GLOBALISATION 
FIRST A ROUND UP OF TODAY'S NEWS 
OUR MAIN STORY 
EIGHT MEN HAVE GONE ON TRIAL 
ACCUSED OF PLOTTING TO BLOW UP 
TRANSATLANTIC AIRLINERS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX BY 
DETONATING EXPLOSIVE DEVICES 
DISGUISED AS SOFT DRINKS THE JURY 
AT WOOLWICH CROWN COURT WAS TOLD 
THAT SEVEN FLIGHTS FROM HEATHROW 
AIRPORT HAD BEEN TARGETED WITH THE 
INTENTION OF INFLICTING CARNAGE AND 
CASUALTIES IN THE NAME OF ISLAM 
ALL EIGHT MEN DENY THE CHARGES 
TODAY THE BANK OF ENGLAND PUBLISHED 
ITS QUARTERLY SURVEY OF CREDIT 
AVAILABILITY AND IT MAKES GRIM 
READING AS MORTGAGES GET MORE 
EXPENSIVE AND HARD TO GET PAUL 
MASON JOINS ME NOW GETTING WORSE 
WE HAVE HAD SIX MONTHS WHERE PEOPLE 
HAVE SAT BACK AND WATCHED THE 
INVESTMENT BANKERS FEEL THE PAIN OF 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH THIS WEEK 
PEOPLE ARE REALISING WHO IT REALLY 
IS WHO IS GOING TO FEEL THE PAIN 
AND THAT HIS ASS THE BORROWERS OF 
MORTGAGES BECAUSE THIS BANK OF 
ENGLAND REPORT TODAY IS A REALLY 
CLEAR PICTURE OF A RAPID STRONG 
TIGHTENING OF MORTGAGE AVAILABILITY 
CITIES US THE MORTGAGE BORROWERS 
WHEN THEY ASKED WHO WOULD MAKE 
MORTGAGES MORE AVAILABLE NOT MANY 
WHO IS GOING TO MAKE THEM LESS 
AVAILABLE WELL IN THE FIRST 
QUARTER OF THE YEAR THIRTY ONE PER CENT REDUCTION 
AND IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS WE 
WILL SEE FORTY TWO PER CENT REDUCTION THIS IS 
NOT JUST GOING TO HIT FIRST TIME 
BUYERS ANYBODY WITH ONE OF THOSE 
MORTGAGES THAT SAYS IN THE SMALL 
PRINT AFTER THREE YEARS YOUR RATE 
GOES UP TO STANDARD RATE SHOULD 
DIG OUT THE DOCUMENTS AND HAVE A 
LOOK AT WHAT THE RATE IS BECAUSE 
IT WILL BE HARD TO GET SOMETHING 
BETTER IN THE MARKET 
WHAT WILL IT 
DO TO THE 
HOUSING MARKET THE THE HOUSING MARKET IS LAGGING BEHIND 
PEOPLE ARE STILL LOOKING FOR 
PROPERTIES THE DEMAND FOR 
MORTGAGES IS THERE IT IS THE 
SUPPLIER THERE HAS BEEN A FORTY PER CENT 
YEAR ON YEAR REDUCTION IN THE 
APPROVAL OF MORTGAGES THAT WILL 
EVENTUALLY TRICKLE THROUGH TO THE 
HOUSING MARKET AND HOUSE PRICES SO SO HOW IS IT THAT BANKS ARE CHARGING 
HIGHER RATES WHEN BASE RATES ARE 
FALLING WHO IS MAKING THE MONEY 
THE SURVEY CONTAINS A CLEAR ANSWER 
THEY ASKED THEM WHY IT IS THEY DO 
NOT WANT TO LEND MONEY IS IT 
BECAUSE YOU AS BANKS ARE PAYING 
HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND CANNOT 
PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE MONEY THE 
BANKS SAID NO IT IS NOT THAT 
PROBLEM WE ARE GETTING CHEAP MONEY 
THROWN AT US BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
BUT THE FACT IS THEY HAVE BECOME 
RISK AVERSE LENDING TO YOU AND ME 
IS MORE RISKY TO BE REWARDED FOR 
THAT EXTRA RISK THEY HAVE TO HAVE 
HIGHER PROFITS WE ARE ENTERING A 
PERIOD WHERE REAL BASE RATES WILL 
PROBABLY GO DOWN QUARTER POINT 
BUT ACTUAL INTEREST RATES THAT THE 
PUBLIC PAYS WILL GO UP AND THE 
DIFFERENCE IS SWALLOWED BY A PROFIT 
THERE IS MARKET LOGIC BUT I AM 
NOT SURE HOW POPULAR IT WILL BE 
TWO BODIES REPRESENTING SENIOR 
POLICE OFFICERS HAVE REPEATED CALLS 
FOR CANNABIS TO BE RESTORED TO THE 
CATEGORY OF A CLASS B. DRUG THE 
ASSOCIATION OF CHIEF POLICE 
OFFICERS AND THICK POLICE

THE SCHOOLGIRL WHO DISAPPEARED FOR 
OVER THREE WEEKS HAS APPEARED IN 
COURT IN WEST YORKSHIRE ARE CHARGED 
WITH POSSESSING INDECENT IMAGES OF 
CHILDREN CRAIG MEEHAN FROM 
DEWSBURY WAS REMANDED IN CUSTODY 
THE SCHOOL SECRETARY ED BALLS 
DEMONSTRATED AN UNUSUAL WAY TO SET 
UP PLANS TO BUILD AND RENOVATE 
PLAYGROUNDS ACROSS ENGLAND HE SAID 
HE WANTED TO BOOST PARENTS' 
CONFIDENCE THAT CHILDREN CAN PLAY 
OUTSIDE IN SAFETY HE AND CULTURE 
SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM WENT ON TO 
DEMONSTRATE HOW 
TONY BLAIR IS DOING GOD IN A BIG 
WAY TONIGHT IN A SPEECH ABOUT 
FAITH AND GLOBALISATION HE SAID 
THAT WHEN HE WAS ASKED IF FAITH WAS 
IMPORTANT TO HIS POLITICS IT WAS 
LIKE ASKING SOMEONE WHETHER HEALTH 
IS IMPORTANT TO THEM OR THEIR 
FAMILY SINCE LEAVING NUMBER TEN 
TONY BLAIR HAS CONVERTED TO ROMAN 
CATHOLICISM BECOME A FELLOW AT 
YALE UNIVERSITY FOR THE NEXT 
ACADEMIC YEAR WHERE HE WILL 
EXAMINE THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN THE 
MODERN WORLD BECOME A SPECIAL 
ENVOY TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND IS 
LAUNCHING THE TONY BLAIR FAITH 
FOUNDATION THIS YEAR IN A MOMENT 
WE WILL DISCUSS HIS GOD PROFUSION 
BUT FIRST HERE IS MICHAEL CRICK 
IT SEEMED LIKE OLD TIMES AHEAD OF 
HIS BIG SPEECH THE USUAL PHOTO 
OPPORTUNITY AT A LONDON SCHOOL AS 
TODAY THE EX PRIME MINISTER TURNED 
DIPLOMAT LECTURE MAKER AUTHOR AND 
MILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN ADDED ONE 
MORE JOB TO HIS BURSTING C. V. 
RELIGIOUS TEACHER 
DO YOU REALISE 
HOW MUCH THE FAITHS HAVE IN COMMON 
HE WAS THE SON OF AN ATHEIST BUT 
PROBABLY THE MOST RELIGIOUSLY 
COMMITTED PRIME MINISTER OF THE 
LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY HIS RELATIONSHIP 
WITH CONSERVATIVE U. S. PRESIDENT WITH WHOM HE WENT TO WAR BOLSTERED 
BY THEIR COMMON CHRISTIANITY YOU YOU DO NOT PRAY TOGETHER 
KNOW WE DO 
NOT PRAY TOGETHER 
WHY DO YOU 
SMILE 
WHY DO YOU ASK ME THE SMILE QUESTION 
HE SAW THE POPE ON THE QUESTION EVE OF THE IRAQ WAR AND AGAIN 
BEFORE LEAVING OFFICE HE THEN 
CONVERTED TO CATHOLICISM YOU CAN 
NEVER FULLY UNDERSTAND THE 
POLITICAL MAKE UP OF TONY BLAIR 
WITHOUT THE IMPORTANCE 
TO HIM OF HIS RELIGIOUS FAITH AND 
YET DURING THE TEN YEARS OF HIS 
PREMIERSHIP IT WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING 
THAT WAS RATHER DOWNPLAYED AS HIS 
FORMER PRESS SECRETARY ALASTAIR 
CAMPBELL ONCE REMARKED WE DON'T DO 
GUARD GOD AS ANTI WAR 
PROTESTERS OUTSIDE NOISILY ACCUSED 
THE CHRISTIAN BLARE OF LIES MURDER 
AND WAR CRIMES HE DELIVERED A 
SPEECH SHE HAD FELT CONSTRAINED 
FROM MAKING IN OFFICE 
THERE IS A 
REASON WHY MY FORMER PRESS 
SECRETARY ONCE FAMOUSLY SAID WE 
DON'T DO GOD IN OUR CULTURE HERE 
IN BRITAIN AND MANY OTHER PARTS OF 
EUROPE TO ADMIT TO HAVING FAITH 
LEADS TO A WHOLE SERIES OF 
SUPPOSITIONS NONE OF WHICH IS 
HELPFUL TO THE PRACTISING 
POLITICIAN FIRST YOU MAY BE 
CONSIDERED WEIRD NORMAL PEOPLE ARE 
NOT SUPPOSED TO DO GOD 
IN POWER 
HE HAD NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD HE 
SAID THE SUDDEN RISE OF THE EAST 
INDIA AND CHINA AND FAITH HE 
THOUGHT WAS NOW A WAY TO UNIFY THE 
WORLD EAST AND WEST WITH COMMON 
VALUES 
I AM NOT A RELIGIOUS LEADER VALUES TODAY I AM NO LONGER A POLITICAL 
LEADER I AM AWARE OF THE JIBES AND 
RIDICULE THAT ATTENDS ANYONE IN 
POLITICS SPEAKING ABOUT RELIGION 
AND I MAKE NO CLAIMS TO MORAL 
SUPERIORITY QUITE THE OPPOSITE 
BUT I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT THE 
IMPORTANCE OF FAITH TO OUR MODERN 
WORLD AND ABOUT THE NEED FOR 
PEOPLE OF FAITH TO REACH OUT TO ONE 
ANOTHER FOR US FAITH IS NOT AN 
HISTORICAL RELIC BUT A GUIDE FOR 
HUMANITY ON ITS PATH TO THE FUTURE 
AND A FAITHLESS WORLD NOT ONE IN 
WHICH WE WANT OURSELVES OR OUR 
CHILDREN TO LIVE 
NEXT MONTH MR. 
BLAIR SEEMS YET ANOTHER TASK 
STARTING HIS NEW FAITH FOUNDATION 
BUT MANY ARGUE HE IS FUNDAMENTALLY 
WRONG 
TONY BLAIR'S OBJECTIVES ARE WRONG WONDERFUL BUT THE METHOD IS SO 
FLAWED BY HIS OWN OBSESSION WITH 
RELIGION RELIGION IS A MAJOR 
PROBLEM FOR WORLD PEACE IT IS A 
MAJOR PROBLEM FOR A HUMAN RIGHTS 
AND IT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR 
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WHY HE 
CANNOT SEE THAT I DO NOT KNOW 
WHAT HE SHOULD BE DOING IS MAKING 
HIS FOUNDATION OPEN TO EVERYBODY 
AND NOT A RELIGIOUS FOUNDATION 
THAT WAY HE WOULD GET MUCH MORE CO 
OPERATION AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE THE 
RESISTANCE TO THE WORK THAT IT DOES 
TONIGHT WESTMINSTER CATHEDRAL'S 
MOST FAMOUS NEW CONVERT SAID HE 
WOULD NOT GET INVOLVED IN DISPUTES 
SUCH AS ABORTION BUT A PRIME TONY 
BLAIR AIM NOW WOULD BE TO GET WORLD 
LEADERS TO HONOUR THE INCREASINGLY 
UNCERTAIN MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT 
GOALS THAT HE HELPED THE GREEN IN 
OFFICE OFFICE I AM JOINED BY ANTHONY GRAYLING 
PHILOSOPHER PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR 
AT BIRKBECK COLLEGE AND PROFESSOR 
RICHARD LURGAN PRESIDENT OF YALE 
UNIVERSITY WHO INVITED TONY BLAIR 
TO BE INVOLVED IN TEACHING ON FAITH 
AND GLOBALISATION NEXT YEAR 
RICHARD LEVIN YOU HEARD TONY BLAIR 
SAY THAT FAITH IS A GUIDE IS THERE 
A DANGER THAT BY FOLLOWING FAITH 
IT CAN LEAD TO DECISIONS THAT FLY 
IN THE FACE OF EVIDENCE WITHOUT 
GOING INTO DETAIL ON THE EVIDENCE 
FOR WMD IN IRAQ FAITH MIGHT HAVE 
PLAYED A PART IN THE DECISION TO 
INVADE IRAQ 
I THINK THAT IS NOT 
VERY PLAUSIBLE L. THINK IN FACT 
TONY BLAIR HAS HIS OWN PERSONAL 
COMMITMENT ABOUT RELIGION BUT I 
HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE HAS A 
SOPHISTICATED WAY OF THINKING ABOUT 
THIS IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE WHOLE 
OF HIS SPEECH THAT IT WAS VERY 
THOUGHTFUL AND HE IS QUITE AWARE 
THAT FAITH CAN LEAD IN THE WRONG 
DIRECTION THAT IS ONE OF THE 
PUZZLES HE WANTS TO POSE FOR THE 
COURSE HE WILL BE TEACHING AT YALE 
NEXT FOUR HOW CAN THE POSITIVE 
ELEMENTS OF RELIGION BE CHAMP 
CHANNELLED FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD 
RATHER THAN THE FORCES 
AND CONFLICT 
ANTHONY GRAYLING IT 
IS IMPORTANT THAT LEADERS HAVE A 
CREDO IF THEIR MORAL COMPASS IS 
SET BY FAITH THAT IS NOT 
NECESSARILY A BAD THING 
IT WOULD 
BE BETTER IF THEY WERE FULLY 
SIGNED UP TO ALL OF THE VALUES 
PEOPLE CALL ENLIGHTENED VALUES 
ABOUT PLURALISM INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY 
DEMOCRACY RULE OF LAW HUMAN 
RIGHTS ENLIGHTENMENT VALUES 
INDEED THOSE PROVIDE A BASIS FOR 
EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD TO SIGN UP 
TO AS THEY DID IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT WHEN THE 
UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS WAS ADOPTED THE FACT IS 
THAT FAITH CAN BE COMMANDED VERY 
OFTEN IS AND WE SEE IT IN THE NEWS 
ALL THE TIME VERY DIVISIVE A 
SOURCE OF CONFLICT IN OUR WORLD 
THERE ARE VERY SINCERE PEOPLE OF 
FAITH TO DO GOOD CHARITABLE WORK 
BUT IT WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER 
AND MORE CONSTRUCTIVE I THINK IF 
THE SOLUTION THAT FAITH PEOPLE 
THEMSELVES SAW WAS TO BE A LITTLE 
LESS PRESENT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN 
BECAUSE SOMETIMES AS WE HAVE SEEN 
WITH ROMAN CATHOLICS AND THE 
EMBRYOLOGY BILL THEY CAN BE VERY 
DIVISIVE 
ON THE QUESTION OF IRAQ DIVISIVE DO YOU THINK THAT TONY BLAIR MUST 
IN A SENSE BE RACKED WITH GUILT 
THAT AFTER HER IRAQ FAITHS HAVE 
BEEN SET AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS 
WITH IN THAT COUNTRY 
I SEE NO 
CONNECTION BETWEEN HIS VIEW OF IRAQ 
AND HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS SECOND 
TONY BLAIR HAS CONFRONTED RELIGIOUS 
DIVISIVENESS IN MANY FORMS DURING 
HIS LEADERSHIP YEARS FIRST THE 
CONFLICT BETWEEN CATHOLICS AND 
PROTESTANTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
SUBSEQUENTLY THE CONFLICT BETWEEN 
CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS IN THE 
FORMER YUGOSLAVIA AND MORE 
RECENTLY THE FOCUS ON THE MIDDLE 
EASTERN CONFLICT BETWEEN MUSLIMS 
AND JEWS HE IS PERFECTLY AWARE 
THAT RELIGION OFTEN LEADS TO 
CONFLICT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE 
WANTS TO UNDERSTAND WHY IS THAT 
THE CASE AND HOW COULD RELIGION BE 
CHANNELLED IN A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE 
DIRECTION IT SEEMS A LEGITIMATE 
QUESTION TO ASK AND ONE THAT WILL 
INSPIRE AND STIMULATE STUDENTS AT 
YALE AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD TO 
THINK ABOUT THESE ISSUES INSTEAD 
OF JUST SAYING RELIGION SHOULD BE 
IN A CLOSET AND WE SHOULD IGNORE IT 
I BELIEVE HE AND TONY BLAIR ARE 
BOTH RIGHT TO RECOGNISE THE 
POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT THAT EXISTS 
WHEN THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF VIEW 
AMONG THE RELIGIONS NORTHERN 
IRELAND IS CASE IN POINT WE SAW 
FOR MANY DECADES CATHOLIC CHILDREN 
BEING EDUCATED IN CATHOLIC SCHOOLS 
PROTESTANT CHILDREN IN PRODUCTS 
IN PROTESTANT SCHOOLS THAT WAS 
WAY OF KEEPING THE CONFLICT GOING 
FROM THAT THE INFERENCE SHOULD BE 
THAT THE MAJOR RELIGIOUS GROUPINGS 
IN SOCIETY THE FAITH INTEREST 
GROUPS SHOULD TAKE STEP BACK 
FROM THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THEY HAVE 
EVERY RIGHT TO EXIST AND PUT THEIR 
POINT OF VIEW THEY ARE AN 
IMPORTANT VOICE IN THE DEBATE BUT 
THE THING IS THAT THEY HAVE TOO 
LARGE A SLICE OF THE PIE ABOUT THREE PER CENT 
OF THE ENGLISH POPULATION GOES TO 
CHURCH ON SUNDAY AND WE HAVE TWENTY SIX 
BISHOPS IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS SO 
WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IS FOR SOMEBODY 
LIKE TONY BLAIR TO USE HIS 
INFLUENCE AND SAY YOU ARE ENTITLED 
TO HAVE YOUR FAITH POSITION BUT 
RECOGNISE THAT YOU ARE JUST ONE 
KIND OF CIVIL SOCIETY GRIPPING 
ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHERS 
DO YOU 
THINK THAT THE BIG ENEMY THE 
COMMON ENEMY IS SECULARISM THE THE COMMON ENEMY IS FUNDAMENTALISM AND 
CLOSED MINDEDNESS IT IS QUITE 
POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN 
THEIR SEPARATE CULTURAL IDENTITIES 
AND RECOGNISE UNDERNEATH THAT THEY 
SHARE COMMON VALUES COMMON RESPECT 
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS L. BELIEVE THAT IS 
TONY BLAIR'S POSITION ON THIS ISSUE 
AND I WOULD SHARE THAT POSITION 
EVEN THOUGH I DO NOT SHARE HIS 
RELIGIOUS FAITH 
THE POINT WAS THAT 
WE HAD TEN YEARS WHERE ALASTAIR 
CAMPBELL SAID WE DON'T DO GOD 
WERE WE BEING DUPED 
I THINK WE'VE 
VERY WE MAY WELL HAVE BEEN IT 
WAS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO COME OUT 
AND SAY THERE WAS AN AGENDA THEY 
WERE SIGNED UP TO BECAUSE IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN VERY CONTROVERSIAL L. 
DON'T BELIEVE THE MAJORITY OF 
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY OR IN THE 
WESTERN WORLD WANT PEOPLE OF A 
STRONG FAITH COMMITMENT AT THE HELM 
OF THE SHIP BUT BEHIND THE SCENES 
WE SAW A TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN 
FUNDING FOR FAITH BASED SCHOOLING 
IN OUR COUNTRY WHICH IS 
POTENTIALLY VERY DIVISIVE WE ALSO 
SAW AS IN THE OLD DAYS IN THE SIXTIES 
WHEN THE TRADE UNIONISTS WERE 
HAVING BEER AND SANDWICHES AT 
NUMBER TEN WE ARE SORRY LOT OF 
FAITH LEADERS HAVING BEER AND 
SANDWICHES 
TONY BLAIR 
IS SAYING IT SANDWICHES IS AN INCREASINGLY INTERDEPENDENT 
WORLD THAT IS INCREASINGLY 
FRACTURED AND FRACTIOUS AND FAITH 
HAS THE ABILITY TO BE THE GLUE HE HE IS RIGHT IN HIS DIAGNOSIS OF THE 
SITUATION AND WRONG IN THE SOLUTION 
OFFERED INDEED GLOBALISATION DOES 
CREATE FRICTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT 
INTEREST GROUPS AND DIFFERENT VIEWS 
ABOUT THINGS SO THE SOLUTION IS TO 
SAY TO THEM YOU ARE A MINORITY 
ONE VOICE AMONG MANY INSTEAD OF 
PRIVILEGING THEM AND ADVANCING 
THESE VOICES EVEN FURTHER AS WE ARE 
SEEING AT THE MOMENT 
DO YOU THINK 
THAT IN A GLOBALISED WORLD FAITH 
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE 
I THINK IT IS JUST AN EMPIRICAL 
REALITY THAT FAITH IS IMPORTANT IN 
POLITICS AND IN THE GLOBAL CONFLICT 
SO WE COULD SAY AND I WOULD BE THE 
FIRST TO WELCOME AN ERA IN WHICH 
SECULAR HUMANISM PREVAILED AND 
RELIGION HAD NO DIVISIVE INFLUENCE 
ON POLITICAL LIFE THAT WOULD BE 
WONDERFUL WORLD BUT FRANKLY IT IS A 
FANTASY BRITAIN MAY BE CLOSE TO 
SUCH WORLD BUT BRITAIN IS MUCH 
MORE SECULAR THAN MOST PARTS OF THE 
WORLD RELIGION PLAYS A BIG ROLE IN 
LIFE IN THE MIDDLE EAST A HUGE 
ROLE IT PLAYS A BIG ROLE IN LIFE 
IN AMERICA MUCH MORE SO THAN IN 
BRITAIN AS CONSEQUENCE I THINK 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 
FACT AND TO TRY TO UNDERTAKE 
POLITICAL ANALYSIS THAT TAKES FAITH 
INTO ACCOUNT L. THINK THAT IS 
LEGITIMATE QUESTION FOR THE NEW 
MEMBER OF OUR FACULTY TO BE 
PURSUING AND GREAT UNIVERSITY
