WITH THE PROBLEM ALSO TAPPING 
INTO THE THAMES TO HELP SOLVE THE 
CAPITAL'S WATER SHORTAGE 
AND THE SUN MIGHT BE OUT AT 
PICCADILLY CIRCUS BUT LOTS OF 
TOURISTS ARE NOT ABBEY EXPLAINING 
WHY MILLIONS ARE DELIBERATELY STAY 
AWAY FROM THE CAPITAL LATER IN THE 
PROGRAMME I'LL BE 
GOOD EVENING WHEN SIXTEEN YEAR OLD 
JIMMY MIZEN WAS MURDERED IN AN 
UNPROVOKED ATTACK IN SOUTH EAST 
LONDON ON SATURDAY MORNING HE 
ADDED TO THE GROWING NUMBER OF 
TEENAGERS WHO HAVE NEEDLESSLY DIED 
ON LONDON'S STREETS HE IS ONE OF 
THIRTY NINE KILLED SINCE JANUARY LAST YEAR 
BUT B. B. C. LONDON HAS DISCOVERED THAT 
THE PROBLEM IS FAR WORSE WHEN YOU 
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NUMBER OF GUN 
AND KNIFE CRIME VICTIMS UNDER THE 
AGE OF TWENTY FIVE OUR HOME AFFAIRS 
CORRESPONDENT IS IN ELTON FOR US 
NOW 
THE PARENTS AND CLASSMATES OF JIMMY 
MIZEN HELD A SPECIAL SERVICE HERE 
TODAY IN MEMORY OF THE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD 
WHO LOST HIS LIFE SO VIOLENTLY HE 
IS THE THIRTEENTH TEENAGER TO BE MURDERED 
THIS YEAR BUT IT IS NOT JUST 
TEENAGERS IF YOU COUNT THOSE UNDER 
TWENTY FIVE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES THAN 
THE PROBLEM IS FAR WORSE 
THE DAY WOULD HAVE BEEN TYNO 
KAVUALA OR AT'S BIRTHDAY HE WAS 
SHOT WHILE SITTING IN A CAR THERE 
HAS BEEN LITTLE MENTION IN THE 
MEDIA AND HIS DEATH IS STILL 
UNSOLVED HIS PARENTS BELIEVE PART 
OF IT MAY BE DOWN TO TOO MUCH FOCUS 
ON TEENAGE VIOLENCE 
WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED TO OUR SON THEY DIDN'T 
FIND THE KILLER WE ARE NOT 
SUPPORTED NOBODY CAME TO ASK US 
ABOUT IT ESPECIALLY THE MEDIA SO SO WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE METROPOLITAN 
POLICE'S FIGURES FOR MURDER 
A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF THOSE 
ARE MALE AND BLACK 
THERE IS A 
CLEAR PATTERN WHERE IN SPECIFIC 
MADE OF ITS IN SPECIFIC WARDS YOU 
ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE WORD 
MURDERED NEIGHBOURHOODS THOSE 
ARE AREAS WHERE THERE IS 
DISPROPORTIONATE POVERTY AND 
DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTATION 
OF YOUNG BLACK MEN 
THE HEAD OF 
THEIR CRIME DIRECTED IS AWARE OF 
THE PROBLEM NOT JUST AFFECTING 
TEENAGERS BUT YOUNG MAN ARE WE AT 
CRISIS POINT 
IT IS IT USUALLY 
SERIOUS SITUATION WE DON'T 
UNDERESTIMATE THAT WE ARE REDUCING 
OVERALL VIOLENT CRIME BUT WE ARE 
NOT IN THE LEAST BIT COMPLACENT 
ABOUT THE CRITICAL DRIVE TO PREVENT 
FURTHER MURDERS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN 
LONDON 
A THERE ARE TOO MANY LONDON VICTIMS TO NAME HERE ALL OF THEM 
HAVE FAMILY AND FRIENDS THE 
PROBLEMS SEEM TO BE FAR WORSE THAN 
FIRST APPEARED WELL WE'RE JUST 
GETTING SOME NEWS IN AT THE MOMENT 
THAT A TWENTY YEAR OLD OR A MAN IN HIS 
TWENTIES HAS BEEN STABBED OUTSIDE 
MCDONALD'S IN OXFORD STREET NOT 
FAR FROM OXFORD CIRCUS HE WAS 
TAKEN TO HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS 
PRONOUNCED DEAD IT IS STILL VERY 
EARLY DAYS THE MURDER 
INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN SET UP BUT 
NO ARRESTS SO FAR OBVIOUSLY WE 
WILL BRING YOU AS MUCH NEWS AS WE 
CAN LATER IN THE PROGRAMME JUST AS 
A FINAL THOUGHT IF THERE IS ANY 
COMFORT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LOST 
LOVED ONES TO VIOLENT CRIME AND IF 
THERE IS ANY DETERRENT FOR THOSE 
INTENT ON PICKING UP A KNIFE OR GUN 
AND USING IT THEN NINE OUT OF TEN 
MURDER CASES OUT EVENTUALLY SOLVED 
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THE UPDATE 
BORIS JOHNSON WASTED NO TIME IN 
APPOINTING A DEPUTY MAYOR FOR YOUNG 
PEOPLE HE JOINS US NOW WE ASKED 
THE POLICEMAN IN THAT REPORT LET 
ME ASK YOU AS WELL IS THIS A 
CRISIS 
I THINK THE SITUATION IS CRISIS SERIOUS I WANT TO JOIN THE MAYOR 
OF LONDON AND ALL OF HIS STAFF IN 
EXPRESSING OUR DEEPEST SYMPATHY WE 
BELIEVE THE FAMILY ACTED WITH MUCH 
DIGNITY 
CAN YOU BRING DOWN THE DIGNITY RATE OF TEENAGE MURDERS IN LONDON 
I THINK BORIS JOHNSON HAS MADE IT 
CLEAR THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN THAT 
THIS IS PRIORITY HE HAS 
APPOINTED MEANDER TO WORK ON THIS 
ISSUE WITH THE GREATEST OF SPEED 
AND ANNOUNCE MEASURES THAT WILL 
MAKE DIFFERENCE TO LONDONERS 
WE'RE GOING TO BE ANNOUNCING 
MEASURES LATER IN THE WEEK FOR NOW 
WE ARE TALKING AND PLANNING WE ARE 
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT WILL 
MAKE LASTING DIFFERENCE NOT JUST 
TO MAKE HEADLINES 
YOU HAVE 
RECENTLY BLAMED PARENTS AS PART OF 
THE PROBLEM FOR WHAT WE ARE SEEING 
IN LONDON DO YOU STAND BY THAT 
BECAUSE SO MANY YOUNG BLACK 
YOUNGSTERS ARE INVOLVED IN THIS 
ISSUE AND HAD BEEN THE VICTIMS OF 
CRIME ARE BLACK PARENTS MORE TO 
BLAME THAN OTHER PARENTS THE THE PROBLEM IS FOUR OF US AND ALL OF 
US HAVE TO FIND A WAY OF DEALING 
WITH IT ALL OF US 
WHERE DO YOU 
THINK THE ROOT CAUSE LIES IS IT IN 
THE FAMILY HOME IS IT IN SOCIETY 
IS IT ON T. V. OR MUSIC WHERE DO WE 
START 
YOU START BY TALKING AND START LISTENING AND THEN WE BEGIN ACTING 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BORIS 
JOHNSON IS COMMITTED TO HIS FINDING 
SOLUTIONS THAT WILL BE LONG TERM 
AND LONG LASTING 
WILL WE SEE THESE 
SOLUTIONS COME INTO FORCE HOW WELL 
WE GOING TO MEASURE YOUR SUCCESS 
BY THE NUMBER OF MURDERS COMING 
DOWN 
BORIS JOHNSON IS CERTAINLY DOWN COMMITTED TO SEEING THE MURDER RATE 
DROP WE WILL BE ANNOUNCING THINGS 
TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK WHICH 
YOU WILL HEREOF YOU CAN MEASURE 
THE EFFECT SOON AFTER 
YOU KEEP 
REFERRING BACK TO THE MAYOR BUT 
YOU HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN BECAUSE OF 
YOUR BACKGROUND AS A PRISON 
GOVERNOR SOMEONE WHO HAS WORKED 
WITH YOUNG BLACK MEN IN LONDON TO 
EMPOWER THEM WHAT IDEAS HAVE YOU 
GOT WHAT ARE YOU BRINGING TO THE 
TABLE WHY DID THE MAYOR ASK YOU TO 
COME FORWARD AND HEAD UP THIS AREA 
DEALING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE 
I THINK 
MAYOR JOHNSON ASKED ME BECAUSE OF 
MY EXPERIENCE OF WORKING AT THE 
ACADEMY I WANT TO BRING SOME OF 
THE EXPERIENCES FROM THAT 
INITIATIVE TO BEAR IN THIS 
PARTICULAR POST L. ACT UNDER THE 
MAYOR'S AUTHORITY AND WITH HIS 
MANDATE IT IS NECESSARY FOR ME TO 
REFER BACK TO HIM WHEN ANSWERING 
QUESTIONS NOT LEAST BECAUSE AT THE 
END OF THE DAY HE WILL BE THE ONE 
JUDGED BY WHAT I SAY AND DO BY BY TAKING UP THE POSITION YOU MUST 
SURELY BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN BRING 
DOWN THE NUMBER OF TEENAGE MURDERS 
IN LONDON 
MAYOR MACRO JOHNSON AND 
I ARE VERY COMMITTED TO BRINGING 
DOWN ALL KINDS OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR 
ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR AND ISSUES 
THAT AFFECT YOUNG LONDONERS AND ALL 
OF US 
THERE IS LOTS MORE TO COME 
INCLUDING I AM WITH A GROUP OF 
MOTHERS IN A PUB WHO ARE FIGHTING 
FOR THEIR RIGHTS USING MONEY POWER 
AND I WILL BE TALKING TO MARY 
WILSON FROM THE SUPREMES AS SHE 
REFLECTS ON THE BAND'S FIRST VISIT 
TO LONDON 
NOW THE OLYMPICS MINISTER SAYS 
THAT SHE WILL ATTEND THE WHOLE OF 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN BEIJING THIS 
YEAR TESSA JOWELL SAID IMPROVING 
HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA COULD NOT BE 
ACHIEVED BY BOYCOTTING THE GAMES 
SHE ALSO SAID THAT SHE WOULD MEET 
BORIS JOHNSON THIS WEEK TO DISCUSS 
PREPARATIONS FOR TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE BRITISH 
AIRWAYS CRASH AT HEATHROW IN 
JANUARY HAS DISMISSED SUGGESTIONS 
THAT THE PLANE MAY HAVE SUFFERED 
FROM ELECTRICAL INTERFERENCE 
INVESTIGATORS ARE NOW FOCUSING ON 
THE FUEL SYSTEMS AND ENGINES 
A FINGERTIP SEARCH HAS BEGUN IN 
HARROW AT THE SCENE OF AN 
EXPLOSION THAT LEFT A MAN DEAD 
POLICE ARE SEARCHING FOR EVIDENCE 
OF WHAT CAUSED THE BLAST LAST WEEK 
A PURPLE LIQUID WAS POURED THROUGH 
THE LETTERBOX OF ONE OF THREE 
PROPERTIES DESTROYED THEY SAY 
AVOIDING A FUTURE WATER SHOT 
SHORTAGES HIGHER ON THE LIST OF 
PRIORITIES FOR THAMES WATER THE 
COMPANY HAD BEEN WANTING TO TURN 
OUR RIVER INTO TAP WATER BY 
BUILDING DESALINATION PLANT IN 
EAST LONDON IT WAS OPPOSED BY THE 
FORMER MAYOR KEN LIVINGSTONE WHO 
THOUGHT THE BACTON PLANT WOULD HARM 
THE ENVIRONMENT THE NEW MAYOR HAS 
WITHDRAWN A LEGAL CHALLENGE SO WE 
CAN ACTUALLY BEGIN 
THIS WAS THE WORK THAT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE NEVER WANTED TO SEE 
HAPPEN IN FACT THERE WAS DUE TO 
BE A HIGH COURT CHALLENGE AGAINST 
IT JUST THIS WEEK 
AS OF TODAY THE NEW MAYOR HAS 
GIVEN THE GO AHEAD FOR LONDON'S 
FIRST DESALINATION PLANT IT WILL 
TURN THAMES WATER DID TAP WATER 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION LITRES OF IT EVERY DAY 
IT OPERATES 
KEN LIVINGSTONE'S MAIN 
OBJECTION IN THE PAST HAS BEEN 
INTENSIVE ENERGY USE WE HAVE 
AGREED THAT WE WILL POWER IT WITH 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT RENEWABLE ENERGY THIS IS A 
REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF KIT FOR 
LONDON AND SOMETHING THAT WE WILL 
USE TO REDUCE THE RISK OF HOSEPIPE 
BANS AND THE FUTURE 
THIS FOR MANY 
IS THE MORE FAMILIAR IMAGE OF 
THAMES WATER EVEN AT FULL CAPACITY 
THE NEW PLANT WILL ONLY PRODUCE A 
FIFTH OF THE AMOUNT THAT THAMES WATER 
LOSES THROUGH LEAKS 
WE NEED TO 
TACKLE THE RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF 
WATER THAT IS WASTED ALL THE TIME 
THAMES WATER DO NEED TO DO MORE 
EVEN THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ON THAT 
ALSO WE HAVE GOT TO TACKLE THE 
USAGE OF WATER AND THE DEMAND FROM 
HOUSEHOLDS AND FROM BUSINESSES 
EVEN IF WE FIX ALL OF THOSE LEAKS 
AND ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO USE 
LESS WATER AS WELL AS INTRODUCING 
MORE THINGS LIKE METERING TO HELP 
PEOPLE MANAGE THEIR USE NEW WATER 
SUPPLIES WILL BE NEEDED INTO THE 
FUTURE FUTURE THE NEW PLANT WILL BE THE FIRST OF 
ITS KIND IN THE U. K. LIKE THIS MODEL 
DRAWING WATER FROM THE THAMES TO 
COVER THE NORTH EAST OF THE CAPITAL 
WHEN DROUGHT THREATENS IT WILL 
OPEN AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR WITH 
THAMES WATER ALSO PROMISING TO DO 
MORE TO STOP LENGTHY WORK 
ROADWORKS ROADWORKS AS YOU CAN SEE I HAVE COME TO 
NEARBY CAFE BECAUSE CAMPAIGNING IS 
GATHERING PLACE TO ALLOW MOTHERS TO 
BREAST FEED THEIR CHILDREN IN 
PUBLIC PLACES THIS CAFE ALLOWS 
WOMEN TO DO JUST THAT IN MOMENT 
I WILL BE DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT 
WITH WRITER THAT IS ALSO MOTHER 
OF A YOUNG CHILD AND ALSO A 
BUSINESSMAN ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS 
FIRST THIS REPORT 
LUNCH FOR MUM AND BABY THIS GROUP 
OF YOUNG MOTHERS HAVE MADE THE 
WHITE HORSE THEIR REGULAR MEETING 
PLACE AFTER GETTING COLD 
RECEPTION ELSEWHERE 
THEY ASKED ME 
TO MOVE TO A QUIET AREA OR EVEN 
ONCE THEY SUGGESTED THAT I WENT TO 
THE TOILETS TO FEED HER L. WOULDN'T 
LIKE TO EAT MY DINNER IN A PUBLIC 
TOILET 
THERE COMES A POINT WHEN TOILET YOU NEED TO GO OUT AND IF YOU'RE 
NOT FEELING COMFORTABLE AND RELAXED 
AT SOME POINT THAT MAY INTERFERE 
WITH YOUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE 
BREAST FEEDING 
LUCKILY LANDLORD BREAST FEEDING RICHARD COLTART LOVES HAVING THEM 
IN 
THEY ARE FABULOUS MOTHERS AND IN WE ARE A PUB THAT LOOKS AFTER OUR 
NEIGHBOURHOOD THEY FORM PART OF 
OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD AND IT IS GREAT 
TO HAVE THEM HERE 
THE REGULARS 
DON'T SEEM TO MIND 
YOU JUST NEED 
TO AVERT YOUR EYES IF IT OFFENDS 
YOU 
I DON'T THINK IT'S AN YOU APPROPRIATE THE POPE IS BIG ENOUGH 
TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE WITHIN IT IF 
YOU WANT PUB 
SOME AREAS HAVE 
MORE PROTECTION FOR MOTHERS IN 
SCOTLAND RESTAURANTS AND BARS FACE 
A FINE OF TWO THOUSAND IF THEY BAN 
MOTHERS FROM FEEDING BABIES ON 
THEIR PREMISES THE GOVERNMENT IS 
LOOKING TO INTRODUCE SIMILAR LAWS 
IN ENGLAND 
THE MOMENT THEY ARE FORCED TO 
FIGHT FOR THEMSELVES STACEY IS 
LEADING THE BATTLE ON THE HIGH 
STREET 
IF A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I STREET GAVE ONE OF YOUR STICKERS TO THE 
MANAGERESS SHE SAID SHE WOULD PUT 
IT ON THE COMMUNITY BOARD SHE 
HASN'T WE ARE ASKING LOCAL 
EATERIES TO PUT UP ONE OF OUR 
STICKERS 
AT LAST THE STICKERS GROUP'S HOPE THAT THEIR WORK WILL 
ENCOURAGE OTHER MOTHERS ACROSS 
LONDON TO DO THE SAME 
JOINING ME NOW IS MADDY WITH TEN 
MONTH OLD ALEX SHE IS A WRITER AND 
A MOTHER OF FOUR L. AM ALSO JOINED 
BY SIMON FROM THE FEDERATION OF 
SMALL BUSINESSES SIMON WHY 
SHOULDN'T BUSINESSES BE FORCED TO 
ALLOW MOTHERS TO BREAST FEED IN 
PUBLIC 
WE THINK THAT BUSINESSES PUBLIC ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF LOOKING 
AFTER THEIR CUSTOMERS ALTHOUGH WE 
OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT BREAST FEEDING 
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE 
SCIENTIFIC BENEFITS WE THINK THAT 
BUSINESS OWNER SHOULD HAVE THE 
CHOICE TO EITHER SAY THAT YES 
BREAST FEEDING IS FINE AND NO 
PROBLEM AND WE THINK THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF BUSINESSES WILL DO THAT 
THERE WILL EVEN HELD OUT MOTHERS 
WITH THINGS THAT THEY MIGHT NEED 
BUT SOME BUSINESS PEOPLE CHOOSE 
LET ME PUT THAT TOO MANY THAT 
SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE ARGUMENT 
IF YOU OWN YOUR CUSTOMERS OWNED 
BUSINESS AND YOU KNOW YOUR 
CUSTOMERS YOU KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT 
FOR THEM 
IT IS ABOUT THE CLIENT 
NOT ABOUT THE BUSINESS OR EVEN THE 
MOTHER AT THE END OF THE DAY IF A 
CHILD IS BREAST FED AND IS ONLY 
BREAST FED WHICH MY CHILDREN HAVE 
ALL BEEN THEN WHAT RIGHT DOES 
ANYBODY HAVE TO SAY THAT CHILD 
CANNOT BE ALLOWED A DRINK 
IT IS 
THEIR BUSINESS OTHER CUSTOMERS MAY 
NOT WANT TO SEE MOTHERS DOING THAT 
IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THAT THEY 
ARE AGAINST IT BUT THEY JUST DON'T 
WANT TO SHARE IN THAT 
AT THE END 
OF THE DAY BREAST FEEDING IS NOT 
ABOUT FLAUNTING YOURSELF OR MAKING 
YOURSELF STAND OUT AS BEING 
DIFFERENT TO OTHER PEOPLE IT IS 
ABOUT DOING SOMETHING THAT IS 
TOTALLY NATURAL L. BELIEVE THAT IT 
CAN BE DONE IN A VERY DISCREET WAY 
ALL OF THE WOMEN I KNOW THAT THE 
S. P. D. CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT MOST 
PEOPLE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY ARE 
BREAST FEEDING 
ARE THEY SERIOUS 
CONSEQUENCES TO BUSINESS IS NOT 
ALLOWING WOMEN TO BREAST FEED 
LET'S SAY FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME 
THEY DO BREAST FEED BEING 
SHORTENED BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DO IT 
IN PUBLIC 
I THINK THERE ARE MANY 
WOMEN WHO FIND IT A CHALLENGE TO 
BREAST FEED L. THINK FOR THOSE 
WOMEN THAT DO IF THEY KNOW THEY 
CANNOT GO OUT AND BREAST FEED WHEN 
A CHILD NEEDS IT THEY'RE GOING TO 
BE MORE AND MORE LIKELY TO STOP 
FEEDING EARLIER BECAUSE THEY FEEL 
UNCOMFORTABLE IF THEY KNEW THEY 
COULD GO OUT AND BREAST FEED 
ANYWHERE THEY FELT THEIR CHILD 
NEEDED IT THEY WOULD BE MORE 
LIGHTLY 
ALEX IS ENJOYING HIMSELF LIGHTLY IT MAY BE STOPPING WOMEN FROM 
BREAST FEEDING FOR LONGER YOU SAID 
YOU ACCEPT THE HEALTH BENEFITS 
MAYBE YOU'RE STANDING IN THE WAY OF 
THOSE BENEFITS 
THE FIRST THING 
TODAY IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF 
BUSINESSES WILL BE COMPLETELY HAPPY 
ABOUT IT L. DON'T THINK IT IS A 
MASSIVE PROBLEM THAT MOTHERS ARE 
BEING TURNED AWAY FROM EVERYWHERE 
THEY GO TO BUSINESS OWNERS DO HAVE 
TO LOOK AFTER CUSTOMERS IN THE 
RARE CASES THAT THEY MIGHT BE SOME 
CUSTOMERS WHO ARE NOT HAPPY WITH 
IT 
WOULD YOU ENCOURAGE IT BUSINESSES TO ALLOW WOMEN TO 
BREAST FEED 
ABSOLUTELY BUT THERE BREAST FEED IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF 
CUSTOMERS ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE 
SITUATION THEY WOULD GO ELSEWHERE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US 
WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK YOU 
HAVE HEARD THE ARGUMENTS ON BOTH 
SIDES SHOULD BUSINESSES BE FORCED 
TO ALLOW WOMEN TO BREAST FEED IN 
PUBLIC OR SHOULD IT BE LEFT TO 
THEIR OWN CHOICE 
IT HAS BEEN A LOVELY DAY BUT 
LONDON'S TOURIST BOARD ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE SLOWDOWN IN 
TOURIST NUMBERS HERE IN LONDON 
THEY BLAMED THE GLOBAL SLOWDOWN IN 
FINANCES AND THE GENERAL CREDIT 
CRUNCH THAT WE ARE SEEING TOURISM 
IS A MASSIVE MARKET HERE IN LONDON 
LAST YEAR IT WAS WORTH ELEVEN BILLION 
LET'S SPEAK TO PHIL LAVELL IN 
PICCADILLY PICCADILLY ALL THOUGH IT IS SWELTERING HERE 
TONIGHT IT IS BUSY YOU WOULD 
NEVER NORMALLY THINK COMING HERE 
THAT TOURIST NUMBERS ARE DOWN BUT 
APPARENTLY THEY ARE IN THE CAPITAL 
BECAUSE MILLIONS ARE DELIBERATELY 
STAYED AWAY 
HEAD DOWN TO THE RIVER THERE ARE 
TWO GROUPS YOU CANNOT MISS THE 
JOGGERS AND OF COURSE THE TOURISTS 
WE ARE FROM KANSAS 
THEY COME FOR 
THE SITES AND THE CULTURE BUT THIS 
YEAR LOTS WILL PROBABLY NOT COME 
AT ALL LEAVING OUR TOURISM 
INDUSTRY FEELING A BIT BLUE THE 
NUMBER OF TOURISTS VISITING LONDON 
HAS ROCKETED OVER THE LAST FEW 
YEARS TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND SIX TWENTY SEVEN 
MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BUT FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IT 
IS NOT LOOKING GOOD EXPERTS RECKON 
IT WILL SLOW DOWN AND AMERICA 
APPEARS TO BE RESPONSIBLE THAT IS 
BECAUSE TEN PER CENT OF THOSE WHO VISIT 
LONDON COME FROM THE U. S. AND THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH HAS HIT A LOT OF THEM 
HARD 
IT IS EXPENSIVE COMPARED TO A HARD REGULAR LIFESTYLE 
TOO OTHER ABOUT 
YOUR EXCHANGE RATE 
YEAH I WENT TO 
THE AIRPORT AND I HAD TWO HUNDRED AMERICAN 
DOLLARS THEN I GOT IT IN POUNDS 
AND I FELT I WAS POOR 
THEY ARE IN 
A CREDIT CRUNCH OF THEIR OWN WITH 
THE SOME PRIDE SUB PRIME 
MORTGAGES IT IS EXPENSIVE FOR THEM 
TO COME HERE 
THEY ARE WAS NOT A 
SINGLE AMERICAN TOURIST ON THIS 
DOBBED TOUR BUS TODAY SCARED OF 
THE WATER OR SCARED OF THE POUND 
EITHER WAY THE BOSS SAYS BUSINESS 
THIS YEAR IS BOOMING YOU ARE 
SEEING AMERICANS ARE STILL COMING 
HERE 
NOT NECESSARILY AMERICANS A HERE LOT OF FRENCH SCANDINAVIAN 
EUROPEAN COLLEAGUES BECAUSE THE 
EURO 
IS VERY STRONG TO STERLING IT IT IS ATROCIOUS THIS CITY HAS BECOME 
THE SINGLE MOST EXPENSIVE CITY IN 
THE UNIVERSE YOU COULD GO TO MARS 
FOR A WEEKEND CHEAPER 
AFTER MUCH 
WE THE CONCERN IS WITH A LACK OF 
TOURISTS WILL BUSINESSES STRUGGLE 
TO STAY AFLOAT AMERICA HAS SNEEZED 
DESPITE THE LOT WARM WEATHER 
WILL LONDON CATCH A SMALL COLD 
APPARENTLY EVERY TOURIST WHO COMES 
TO LONDON ON AVERAGE SPENDS EIGHTY EIGHT A 
DAY WHEN YOU TIMES THAT BY THE 
MILLIONS EXPECTED TO STAY AWAY IT 
ADDS UP TO A LOT BUT VISIT LONDON 
SAY IT IS NOT TOO BAD BECAUSE WE 
HAVE HAD TWO FANTASTIC YEARS SO 
EVEN IF NUMBERS ARE DOWN THIS YEAR 
WE ARE STILL IN GOOD SHAPE TO TAKE 
IT IT STILL TO COME THIS EVENING LOOKS 
LIKE WE ARE ENJOYING OUR WARM START 
TO MAY FALL OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS 
WHEN IT LAST WILL BE BACK LATER 
WITH FULL FORECAST ONCE I HAVE 
FINISHED BY ICE CREAM MYHRE ICE 
CREAM CREAM IT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT TRANSPORT 
LINK FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS

OF BREAST FEEDING IN PUBLIC GRAHAM 
SAYS BREAST FEEDING SHOULD BE DONE

WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO BREAST FEED 
IN PUBLIC L. WOULD BE HONOURED TO 
THINK THAT A WOMAN WOULD FEED HER 
BABY IN FRONT OF ME IT MAKES ME 
FEEL TRUSTED WE HAVE TOO MUCH 
GOVERNMENT INFLUENCE ALREADY SAYS 
PETER BUSINESSES SHOULD BE FREE TO 
CHOOSE TO ALLOW WATER BANS HOW 
WOULD WOMEN FEEL IF MEN STARED AT 
THEM AND MADE CRUDE COMMENTS WHILE 
THEY WERE BREAST FEEDING MARGARET 
SAYS IT IS THE MOST NATURAL THING 
TO BREAST FEED BUT NOT IN PUBLIC 
HOW CAN WE MAKE MOTHERS DO IT 
DISCREETLY NEXT AS I DO NOT MIND 
MOTHERS BREAST FEEDING IN PUBLIC 
BUT IT IS OFFENSIVE THAT THEY TAKE 
OVER WHOLE AREAS OF CAFE SHOPS WITH 
NO REGARD FOR OTHER CUSTOMERS IT 
IS NOT A NURSERY JULIA SAYS I DO 
NOT WISH TO SEE WOMEN BREAST 
FEEDING IN PUBLIC AS THE LADY 
INTERVIEWED SAID IT IS PERFECTLY 
NATURAL BUT SO IS SPENDING A PENNY
