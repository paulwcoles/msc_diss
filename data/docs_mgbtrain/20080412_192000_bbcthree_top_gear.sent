AND THE SUZUKI LIANA IS BACK WITH SOME BLOKE CALLED JENSON BUTTON 
HELLO AND WELCOME AND WE START TONIGHT WITH A QUESTION 
HOW MANY VANS DO YOU SUPPOSE WERE SOLD IN BRITAIN LAST YEAR 
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND I'M SORRY 
YOU REALLY ARE AN IRRITATING LITTLE MAN 
YES BUT IT'S WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY 
YOU'RE RIGHT IT WAS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND 
THAT'S TWICE AS MANY AS THE BEST SELLING CAR 
WHICH MEANS THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF VAN DRIVERS OUT THERE 
AND THE THING IS WE NEVER COVER THE SUBJECT EVER ON THE SHOW 
SO THE PRODUCERS SAID THAT WE HAD TO DO A VAN TEST 
THEY ARRANGED FOR US TO BE ROADIES FOR ONE OF THE BANDS 
AT THIS SUMMER'S MUSIC FESTIVAL IN HYDE PARK 
YEAH OBVIOUSLY BEFORE WE COULD DO THIS WE EACH HAD TO CHOOSE A VAN 
TO BE HONEST I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT VANS SO I CHOSE THIS 
IT'S A RENAULT MASTER TWO THINGS STRUCK ME ABOUT IT 
FIRSTLY IT'S VERY LARGE OBVIOUSLY 
AND THE OTHER IS THAT I LIKE THE STYLING I THINK IT'S QUITE CHIC 
HOW CAN IT BE CHIC IT'S A VAN BUT IT'S A VERY GOOD LOOKING VAN 
IT'S AS GOOD LOOKING AS A PLUMBER'S BUM CRACK 
NO WHATEVER WHATEVER 
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT VANS EITHER SO I CHOSE A FORD TRANSIT 
FOR FORTY ONE YEARS IT'S BEEN THE KING OF VANS 
AND NOW THERE'S THIS NEW ONE WHICH IS BETTER 
IN LOTS OF IMPORTANT AND I'M SURE VERY INTERESTING WAYS 
I HAVE TO BE HONEST I KNOW LESS ABOUT VANS 
THAN THESE TWO PUT TOGETHER SO I CHOSE THIS 
VOLKSWAGEN 
T. THIRTY ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR T. D. I. SPORTLINE IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST VAN IN THE WORLD 
AND IT IS QUITE EXPENSIVE BUT IT DOES ONE TWENTY M. P. H. 
BASICALLY YOU WENT FOR THE FASTEST 
THIS IS THE FASTEST VAN IN BRITAIN 
I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT IN SOME WAY 
ANYWAY THE THREE OF US ENDED UP WITH OUR VANS 
AND WE WERE READY TO GO OFF AND BE ROADIES WITH THEM 
RICHARD AND I MADE IT ON TIME TO HYDE PARK AND QUICKLY DISCOVERED 
THE ENORMITY OF THE TASK AHEAD 
WE WERE GOING TO BE ROADIES FOR ONE OF THE BIGGEST BANDS IN THE WORLD 
THE WHO 
WELL WHEN I SAY WE IT'S RICHARD AND ME 
BECAUSE JAMES HAS FOUND SOMETHING BETTER TO DO 
THAN HANG AROUND BACKSTAGE WITH THE GREATEST BAND IN THE WORLD 
YEP HE PHONED TO SAY HE WAS UNWELL BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THIS POSTER 
YOU'LL SEE THAT WHAT HE'S ACTUALLY DOING IS HE'S IN REIGATE 
HOSTING THE SURREY MOTOR SHOW 
HE'LL DOUBTLESS TURN UP LATER ON AFTER ALL THE HARD WORK IS DONE PROBABLY YEAH 
FIRST WE FOUND OUT WHAT WE'D BE TAKING TO THE NEXT GIG 
NINETY MILES AWAY ON THE SOUTH COAST 
ME I'D BE IN CHARGE OF SOMETHING WORRYINGLY PRECIOUS 
PETE TOWNSHEND'S GUITARS' 
EACH GUITAR OH YEAH IS THREE THOUSAND 
AND THERE WERE SEVENTY OF THEM 
HAMMOND ON THE OTHER HAND HAD ONLY ONE INSTRUMENT TO WORRY ABOUT 
BUT IT WAS A BIGGIE YEAH HELLO HYDE PARK 
DO I DO ANYTHING CLEVER OR JUST CARRY STUFF 
THE TWELVE THOUSAND KIT BELONGED TO ZAK STARKEY WHO UNLIKE HIS FATHER 
IS A DRUMMER 
WHAT IF I BREAK SOMETHING LIKE A DRUM SKIN 
DON'T DO IT NO 
MEANWHILE BACK AT THE FRONT OF THE STAGE I'D DISCOVERED 
I'D HAVE TO TRANSPORT PETE'S AMPS AS WELL 
THESE ARE ALL IS THIS WHY HE'S A BIT MUTTON 
ER NO NO NO YES 
ARE THEY VERY HEAVY CAN I LIFT IT UP 
TALK AMONG YOURSELVES 
IT TURNED THAT THE WHO TRAVELS WITH ONE THOUSAND FLIGHT CASES OF EQUIPMENT 
AND OUR VANS ALL TOGETHER COULD HANDLE THE WEIGHT AND BULK OF 
NINE 
I THEREFORE WENT TO SEE PETE TOWNSHEND 
WHO WAS IN HIS MOTOR HOME OVERSEEING SOMETHING CALLED IN THE ATTIC 
HIS NEW LIVE WEBCAST MUSIC SHOW 
UM WE HAVE A PROBLEM 
YOU'VE GOT APPARENTLY ONE THOUSAND PACKING CASES BUT WE CAN ONLY TAKE NINE 
RIGHT SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SLIM DOWN THE NUMBER OF GUITARS YOU NEED 
I COULD GET YOU A REALLY GOOD JOB WITH THE ARCTIC MONKEYS 
AND THEY'RE ONLY TWELVE AND A HALF THREE 
SO THEY WON'T SMACK YOU IN THE FACE WITH A MICROPHONE STAND LIKE I'M ABOUT TO DO 
I NEED ALL MY GEAR AT THAT GIG I NEED IT ALL 
ROGER DALTREY HAD NO INTEREST IN THE SMALLNESS OF MY VAN 
HE JUST WANTED TO EXPLAIN THE BEST WAY OF THROWING A T. V. INTO A POOL 
HAS TO BE PLUGGED IN AND WORKING WHEN IT GOES IN A LONG LEAD 
THE CHALLENGE WAS TO KEEP IT WORKING TILL IT HIT THE WATER 
AH RIGHT IT'S MUCH MORE TECHNICAL THAN THEY REALISE 
THERE'S A LOT OF THOUGHT IN IT 
ROGER KINDLY LENT ME ONE OF HIS TELLIES 
AND PETE KINDLY ORGANISED SOME ENORMOUS TRUCKS 
TO CARRY THE STUFF WE'D HAVE TO LEAVE 
THEN JUST BEFORE THE KICK OFF 
THE HEADLINE ACT FROM THE SURREY MOTOR SHOW TURNED UP 
HOW WAS IT JAMES 
I'M GUESSING BUT HE PROBABLY LEFT BEHIND A SMALLER CROWD THAN THIS' 
I CAN'T EXPLAIN BY THE WHO 
JAMES YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN ABOUT TWO HOURS 
ALL OF THAT LOT OFF HERE INTO OUR VANS AND WE DRIVE NINETY MILES 
AND YOU CANNOT GET LOST NO 
AS THE SHOW NEARED ITS CONCLUSION 
I FERVENTLY HOPED THAT THE WHO WOULD SMASH ALL THEIR EQUIPMENT 
LIKE THEY USED TO 
BUT THEY DIDN'T 
PLAINLY MR. DALTREY REALLY WANTED TO SEE THE THREE OF US SUFFER 
DON'T TAKE ANY PITY ON THEM GUYS ROADIES 
DON'T TAKE ANY PITY ON THEM WHATSOEVER 
AND SO AS THE CROWD WENT HOME WE PUT THE TOP GEAR PIANIST 
IN CHARGE OF KEYBOARDS AND GOT TO WORK 
THREE TWO ONE 
WATCH ME GET IN EVERYBODY'S WAY 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING 
THANKS YOU TAKE THAT 
I PUT ONE IN THERE ALREADY 
AFTER AN HOUR IT WAS TIME TO PACK THE VANS 
BUT THAT WAS A BIT OF A PROBLEM FOR JEREMY 
THAT'S A REAL CLAMP AND IT'S REALLY ON 
THAT'S NOT ROCK AND ROLL IS IT 
LIVINGSTONE IT PROBABLY IS 
HAPPILY BECAUSE OUR VANS WERE SO SMALL 
LOADING THEM UP DIDN'T TAKE LONG 
GOT A DICKIE BACK 
WE'LL GET THE BEERS IN AND I'LL WARM UP THE GROUPIES 
NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING DON'T BE LATE 
AND DON'T GET CLAMPED AGAIN 
GOODBYE LONDON 
OH RUDDY NORA I'VE GONE THE WRONG WAY ALREADY 
WHEN I GET DOWN TO THE HOTEL TONIGHT I'M GONNA MAKE KEITH MOON 
LOOK LIKE KEITH CHEGWIN 
I'M GONNA START BY FIRE AXING MY WAY THROUGH THE WALL 
INTO JAMES' BEDROOM THEN I'M GONNA CUT HIS HAIR 
DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH 
ONLY HAMMOND WAS CONCENTRATING ON THE JOB IN HAND 
THE FLAT LOAD BED IN THE BACK THE MINIMAL INTRUSION FROM THE WHEEL ARCHES 
THE FACT THAT IT'S THE WIDEST WHICH IS WHAT YOU NEED THAT'S HOW YOU LOAD IT 
IT'S ALL BEEN THOUGHT OUT 
AND AT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED 
IT'S ALSO THE CHEAPEST HERE 
WAS JAMES FOCUSING ON THE IMPORTANT STUFF PAYLOAD FUEL ECONOMY 
NO HE WASN'T 
I'VE GOT AIR CONDITIONING I'VE GOT A SEMI AUTOMATIC GEARBOX 
I'VE GOT A C. D. PLAYER I'VE GOT SAT NAV IT JUST GOES ON 
AND ON AND ON 
PREDICTABLY JEREMY GOT SIDETRACKED BY THE SPEED OF THE VAN GTI 
THIS IS NOT FAST FOR A VAN IT'S FAST FULL STOP 
IT DOES ZERO TO SIXTY IN ELEVEN AND A BIT SECONDS 
YOU HIT SEVENTY IN THIRD 
BIZARRELY HOWEVER NONE OF THIS SEEMED TO IMPRESS JAMES' 
I DON'T THINK YOUR VAN'S AS QUICK AS MINE JEREMY 
HOW'LL HE MAKE THAT ONE STAND YOUR VAN DOES EIGHTY SEVEN M. P. H. 
MINE DOES ONE HUNDRED TWENTY I THINK MID RANGE 
MINE'S PRETTY POTENT O. K. THREE TWO 
THIS CAN ONLY END WELL ONE GO 
AS I WAS SAYING JAMES I DON'T THINK YOU'VE QUITE GRASPED 
HOW FAST THIS VAN IS 
BECAUSE THE OTHER TWO DIDN'T HAVE SPEED TO KEEP THEM GOING 
WE PULLED OVER FOR A CUP OF TEA 
I FEEL LIKE A ROADIE TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING YEAH TWO O'CLOCK 
NATURALLY THE TALK SOON TURNED TO HOW CONFIDENT 
WE FELT ABOUT LEAVING OUR CARGO UNATTENDED 
HAMMOND DIDN'T SEEM FAZED AT ALL 
ONE THING IT'S GOT ALL SECURITY SYSTEMS ON IT AND ALARMS 
AND EVEN THE KEY WHEN YOU PLUG IT IN IT CHARGES UP OFF THE IGNITION 
SO I KNOW WHEN I HIT THE BUTTON IT'S LOCKED THAT'S QUITE SAFE 
THIS IS GOOD THIS IS GOT THE RENAULT ANTI INTRUDER DEVICE 
RAID RAID YEAH IT'S GOT DEADLOCKS THAT 
SO YOU WON'T GET IN THERE SO WHAT ABOUT YOURS 
I MIGHT I MIGHT GO AND HAVE MY TEA JUST 
YEAH COS THERE'S SEVENTY THOUSAND WORTH OF GUITARS 
I'M GONNA BE OUT THERE IF YOU WANT ME 
WE WERE NOW SUPPOSED TO KNUCKLE DOWN AND REALLY TEST OUR VANS 
BUT I'M AFRAID WE GOT DISTRACTED 
THIS PARTY PRESUMABLY IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY WILD 
IT'S THE WHO MATE YAYY 
WE WERE FEELING CRAZY WELL I SAY WE 
CRUISE CONTROL HEH HEY 
AT QUARTER TO DAWN WE MADE IT TO THE NEXT VENUE 
LOCKED UP THE VANS AND WITH OUR WORK DONE 
HEADED BACK TO THE PARTY AT THE HOTEL 
SADLY THOUGH IT SEEMS THE WORLD OF ROCK AND ROLL HAS MOVED ON 
THERE WERE NO GROUPIES THE ONLY DRUG WAS COCOA 
AND THERE WAS NO POOL INTO WHICH I COULD THROW ROGER'S T. V. 
SO WE WENT TO BED 
THE NEXT MORNING WE MET TO REACH A VERDICT 
THAT'S HARD WHEN YOU WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION 
I'D LIKE TO SAY THE VOLKSWAGEN WAS THE FASTEST VAN IT WAS YEAH 
IT WAS MINE WAS THE BIGGEST VAN THE RENAULT IS HUGE 
AND MY FORD TRANSIT WAS THE CHEAPEST 
YEAH 
SO NO WE'RE GOING SOMEWHERE 
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT FROM A VAN 
LAST NIGHT I SAID IF YOU'RE A HEART TRANSPLANT DRIVER 
YOURS IS PERFECT UNDOUBTEDLY IT'S NOT VERY BIG 
BUT IT GOES LIKE THE CLAPPERS YES 
IF THE HEART BLOKE DIED FOR EXAMPLE AND YOU WANTED TO MOVE SOME HEADSTONES 
MINE WOULD BE BETTER YOU CAN GET MORE IN AND CARRY BIGGER WEIGHT 
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE ARE AS MANY VANS OUT THERE 
AS THERE ARE THINGS YOU'D WANT TO DO WITH THEM IF YOU WANTED 
A VOLKSWAGEN THAT WAS CHEAPER THAN MINE 
YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN GET A CHEAPER ONE 
BUT WITH THE RENAULT IF YOU DON'T WANT A BIG VAN THEY'LL DO YOU A SMALLER ONE 
SO EVEN THE BIG VANS CAN BE SMALL IF YOU WANT ABSOLUTELY 
WHATEVER VAN YOU WANT IF YOU WANT A VAN BUY THE CHEAPEST 
OF THE SORT OF VAN YOU WANT YEAH 
AND THEN RING ROUND DEALERS AND SEE WHO'LL SELL IT TO YOU FOR LESS 
THAT'S IT THAT'S THAT 
UM NOW UM 
WHEN WE BROUGHT THAT FILM BACK THE PRODUCER WAS VERY ANGRY WITH US 
HE SAID THAT WAS THE WORST CONCLUSION IN THE HISTORY OF T. V. 
MAY HAVE HAD A POINT IN FACT 
HE DREAMT UP A PUNISHMENT FOR US WHICH WE'LL SHOW YOU LATER 
BUT NOW THIS 
IT'S A LETTER FROM A YOUNG MAN CALLED JENSON 
WHO LIVES IN MONTE CARLO 
DEAR TOP GEAR MY CAR IS ALWAYS BREAKING DOWN 
PLEASE COULD YOU FIX IT FOR ME 
TO DRIVE SOMETHING MORE RELIABLE AROUND YOUR TRACK 
HOW COULD WE POSSIBLY SAY NO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN JENSON BUTTON 
HOW ARE YOU I'M GOOD VERY GOOD THANK YOU HAVE A SEAT 
WE'RE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO HELP 
LEAST WE CAN DO 
NOW 
TALK US THROUGH YOUR FACIAL HAIR MY FACIAL HAIR

I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD YOU DO YEAH 
A BIT BACK IT WAS THE NOEL EDMONDS OR A BIT OF A BEADLE GOING ON 
I GET FOUR BALD PATCHES AS WELL HERE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE 
OH YEAH THAT'S NOT A GOOD LOOK 
COMING FROM YOU JEREMY 
I HAVE A BALD PATCH THERE THAT'S EVEN WORSE 
THAT'S EVEN WORSE UM 
YOU LIVE IN MONTE CARLO YOU'RE PAID A NOT INCONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY 
YOU'RE A GOOD LOOKING CHAP DO YOU FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GET WOMEN 
UH THAT'S A TOUGH ONE FOR ME TO ANSWER AT THE MOMENT 
REALLY WHY

I'M BUSY I'M RACING CARS THAT'S ONCE A FORTNIGHT 
ONCE A FORTNIGHT DRIVE ROUND A BIT USUALLY BREAK DOWN BEFORE THE END

I LIKE TO ENJOY MYSELF AS WE ALL DO 
ERM BUT SO YOU GET A LOT OF SEX 
PROBABLY MORE THAN YOU JEREMY 
DAMN RIGHT MATE 
HERE'S A GOOD ONE WOULD THESE RACING CARS BE MORE INTERESTING 
IF THEY WERE FITTED WITH GUNS 
WHAT TYPE OF GUNS MACHINE GUNS MINI GUNS 
A BAZOOKA OR SOMETHING NO MINI GUNS YEAH 
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING IT MIGHT MAKE YOU DRIVE QUICKER REALLY 
IT MIGHT DO IT MIGHT MAKE THE GUY IN FRONT A MACHINE GUN 
YOU'D BE THINKING ABOUT THAT IT'S AN EASIER WAY OF OVERTAKING 
I LOVE YOUR IDEAS I REALLY DO I'VE GOT SO MANY 
YOU HAVE A LOT OF TIME ON YOUR HANDS I HAVE 
ONE THING I HAVE WORKED OUT 
I KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS CAR WHY YOU'RE NOT WINNING ANYTHING 
IT'S THAT WINDSCREEN 
I'M NOT JOKING LOOK 
THEY DESIGN ALL THIS EVERYTHING ON IT IS FLUID 
THEN THEY PUT ON A VERTICAL WINDSCREEN IT'S SLOWING YOU DOWN 
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING IT FLEXES 
TRUST ME 
ANOTHER QUESTION WHY HAVEN'T YOU WON A RACE 
IT'S A. YOU SEE THAT'S A HARD ONE ISN'T IT STRAIGHT IN 
IT'S BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN ASKED THAT BEFORE WHY NOT 
COS YOU'RE GETTING WHAT ONE HUNDRED STARTS NOW 
ONE HUNDRED AND SOMETHING STARTS ONE HUNDRED AND SOMETHING STARTS 
SO WHAT'S THE MATTER 
WE'RE NOT QUICK ENOUGH IT'S THE WINDSCREEN 
GET THE BLOODY WINDSCREEN CHANGED TRUST ME 
WE'RE NOT QUICK ENOUGH WE'LL GET THERE DEFINITELY 
WOULD YOU EXCHANGE THE MONEY THE MONTE CARLO LIFESTYLE 
AND EVERYTHING FOR THAT FIRST WIN 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT YOU WOULD ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
JACK THE LOT IN ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
YOU REALLY WOULD EXCHANGE EVERYTHING 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT YEAH IT'S WHAT I'M 
IT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING FOR TWENTY YEARS ALMOST NOW

IT'S WHAT I LOVE IT'S MY PASSION WHEN I'VE GOT GRANDKIDS TO TELL THEM 
I'VE GOT SO MANY MILLION IN THE BANK WON'T EXCITE THEM 
OH TRUST ME IT WILL

YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT 
HAVE YOU TOLD THEM ALL 
I'M ABOUT TO WE HAD A BET WE DID 
HE SAID HE'D BET ME TWENTY QUID THAT HE COULD COME DOWN HERE 
AND DRIVE ROUND OUR TRACK FASTER THAN THE STIG 
I CAN'T REMEMBER SAYING THAT AT ALL 
YOU WERE QUITE DRUNK 
AND THAT IS A GOOD THING FOR A FORMULA ONE 
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SPIKING MY DRINK I WAS JEREMY 
I BOUGHT THE MONEY I DID WAKE UP A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE 
THERE IS IS OH REALLY TWENTY QUID THAT'S MY TWENTY 
PUT YOUR TWENTY DOWN THERE GET TWENTY OUT YOU EARN EIGHT MILLION 
RACING DRIVERS NEVER CARRY CASH 
PUT TWENTY THERE BECAUSE YOU HAD THE BET 
GOOD PUT IT ON THERE 
NOW OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T SEND YOU ROUND IN 
THE NEW REASONABLY PRICED CAR COS THEY'VE DONE IT IN THE OLD ONE 
CAN I JUST SAY 
IT WAS REALLY HOT TODAY 
IT WAS REALLY HOT AND I HAD TO HAVE THE AIR CONDITIONING ON IN THE CAR 
AND YOU PROBABLY LOSE ABOUT THREE OF THE FIVE HORSE POWER THE CAR HAS 
WHO'D LIKE TO SEE HOW JENSON GOT ON IN THE OLD LIANA 
YES 
PLAY THE TAPE LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
IT'S NICE TO SEE THE OLD CAR BACK 
WE'D BEEN MISSING IT WE HAVE TO USE THIS FOR THE FORMULA ONE 
YOU DO THAT LINE AS WELL FORMULA ONE DRIVERS ALL DO THAT LINE THE STIG DOESN'T 
REALLY NO HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT A FORMULA ONE DRIVER 
MIGHT BE OH NICE BEARD 
I TELL YOU 
HAVE YOU NOTICED I DON'T SAY A WORD 
YOU'RE CONCENTRATING I LOVE THE WAY YOU GUYS CAN CARRY THAT SPEED 
I'VE NEVER DRIVEN A CAR WHERE IT FEELS 
LIKE THE REAR ISN'T CONNECTED TO THE FRONT END 
WHEN YOU WATCH IT IN T. V. COS I WATCH THE SHOW EVERY WEEK 
YEAH IN MONACO YEAH 
AND ER YOU THINK WHY THE HELL ARE THEY TAKING THAT LINE 
BUT YOU DO TAKE A DIFFERENT LOVELY GEAR CHANGE 
THERE HE GOES INTO THE FOLLOW THROUGH WERE YOU FLAT HERE 
EASY IT'S EASY FLAT 
FOR SOME PEOPLE IT WASN'T EASY THE OTHER DAY 
HERE WE COME SECOND TO LAST CORNER THIS CATCHES OUT THE AMATEURS 
THAT'S WIDE THROUGH THERE 
THAT MIGHT HAVE COST YOU SOME TIME 
YOU'LL LIKE THIS BIT YOU'LL LIKE THIS HERE IT IS 
ACROSS THE LINE 
NOW I'VE ACTUALLY GOT A FEELING IT WASN'T THAT HIGH UP 
I SHOULD POINT OUT THIS ONE WAS WET ALL RIGHT OH REALLY YEAH 
IT WASN'T SLOWER THAN MARK WAS IT 
COULD YOU HONESTLY TURN UP IN THE GRAND PRIX CIRCUIT AGAIN 
IF YOU WERE SLOWER THAN HIM 
I'M TRYING TO TALK MYSELF DOWN THEN WE'LL BE A BIT HIGHER 
YOU WEREN'T SLOWER O. K. THAN MARK 
BUT DO YOU THINK YOU BEAT THE STIG 
H. M. M. 
I SAW HIM OUT THERE HE LOOKED GOOD 
HE'S SAYING ALL THE RIGHT THINGS LOOKED GOOD JENSON OH NO 
IN THE WORLD THIS IS IT 
ONE MINUTE 
THE PEN DOESN'T WORK 
IT MUST BE IT'S THE HEAT WE'LL MUDDLE THROUGH 
ONE MINUTE YEAH FORTY 
FOUR YEAH 
POINT 
SEVEN NO 
YES SO YOU HAVE MADE ME 
VERY RICH 
SOMEWHERE IN DORSET 
NIGEL MANSELL JUST BLEW UP WITH EXCITEMENT 
HE DID HAVE THREE DAYS PRACTICE HE BROUGHT HIS JET IN 
HE HAD A GOOD LOOK AT THE TRACK BEFORE GOING OUT THERE 
YOU'VE BEEN A SUPERB SPORT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN JENSON BUTTON 
THANK YOU 
NOW NORMALLY AT THIS POINT IN THE SHOW 
WE WOULD DO THE NEWS BUT IT'S THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER 
EVERYONE'S ON HOLIDAY AND THERE ISN'T ANY 
SO UNLIKE A REGIONAL NEWS PROGRAMME THAT WOULD 
GO OUT ANYWAY AND LOOK FOR A BADGER THAT COULD TAP DANCE 
WE'RE NOT GONNA BOTHER NO THERE IS NO NEWS 
WHAT WE DO HAVE INSTEAD THOUGH IS A NEW ROLLS ROYCE AND HERE IT IS 
IT'S THE 
IT HAS THE SAME ENGINE AS THE PHANTOM 
SO THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY BRAKE HORSE POWER SIX AND THREE QUARTER LITRE V. TWELVE 
BUT THE BODY IS LIGHTER IT'S MADE OF CARBON FIBRE 
APART FROM THIS BIT WHICH IS ALUMINIUM 
YEAH IT'S SHORTER THAN THE PHANTOM IT'S LOWER THAN THE PHANTOM 
AND OF COURSE IT ONLY HAS TWO DOORS 
WHICH READY FOR THIS OPEN BACKWARDS 
SO THAT ONE MAY SIMPLY STEP ABOARD 
THEN INSIDE IT'S THE USUAL BLEND OF DEAD ANIMAL AND RAINFOREST 
BUT WITH A TWIST 
OH YES IF YOU LOOK UP AT THE CEILING YOU WILL SEE 
THAT IT'S LIKE THE MILKY WAY 
RIDING IN THE BACK OF THIS CAR IS LIKE LYING IN A FIELD 
IN CORNWALL IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY CLEAR NIGHT 
IT REALLY IS A FABULOUS THING 
IT'S AMAZING AND IF I WAS HAVING ONE I WOULD HAVE THE GREAT BEAR 
YOU CAN EVEN VARY THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE CONSTELLATION LOOK 
THAT IS DISGUSTING 
OH DEAR I FEAR JEREMY MAY BE HEADING THIS WAY WITH AN OPINION 
NO NO HONESTLY YOU CAN HAVE ONE OF THOSE PINPRICK LIGHT THINGS 
ON THE ROOF OF A LIMO ON A HEN NIGHT 
YOU CANNOT HAVE ONE O. K. IN A ROLLS ROYCE 
AND YOU CAN'T HAVE SEVEN SPOKE ALLOYS OR RED BRAKE CALIPERS 
AND YOU CAN'T HAVE CARBON FIBRE AND LOOK AT THAT 
A GLASS SPIRIT OF ECSTASY WITH A LIGHT BULB UP ITS BOTTOM JEREMY 
THAT THAT IS BRILLIANT 
NO THE PHANTOM IS BRILLIANT O. K. 
THIS IF THEY EVER PUT IT INTO PRODUCTION 
AND IF IT HAS ALL THIS STUFF ON IT 
WILL HAVE TO BE CALLED THE ROLLS ROYCE VULGAR SONIC 
WELL YOU'D KNOW EXACTLY WHEN IT COMES TO VULGAR 
THE OTHER DAY WE WENT TO A SCREENING IF THAT FILM CARS 
MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN IT WE WALKED IN 
AND HE SAID YEAH THIS IS A LOT LIKE MY CINEMA AT HOME 
I'VE JUST HAD A REALLY GOOD IDEA 
WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP 
AND WHY DON'T YOU TELL ALL THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
WITH YOUR TIPPEX TEETH 
ABOUT THE CAR THAT YOU'VE BEEN DRIVING THAT I HAVEN'T OH YES 
I'VE BEEN DRIVING THE LATEST OFFERING FROM ONE OF OUR FAVOURITE CAR MAKERS 
NOBLE WHEN THEY CAME ALONG SEVEN YEARS AGO 
OUR FIRST THOUGHT WAS OH DEAR HERE WE GO AGAIN 
ANOTHER SMALL BRITISH SPORTS CAR FIRM THAT'S GOING TO DISAPPOINT ITS BANK MANAGER 
BUT THEIR FIRST TWO CARS THE M. TEN AND THE M. TWELVE 
WERE ABSOLUTELY SUPERB 
AND NOW HERE COMES THE DIFFICULT THIRD ALBUM 
IT'S A BRAND NEW CAR AND IT'S CALLED THE M. FIFTEEN 
AND UNUSUALLY FOR ONE OF THESE SMALL MANUFACTURERS 
NEW DOESN'T MEAN REHEATED LEFTOVERS 
IT'S GOT A NEW INTERIOR A NEW BODY NEW CHASSIS 
IT'S STILL GOT NOBLE WRITTEN ALL OVER IT 
IT'S LOW IT'S MID ENGINED AND IT'S FAST 
I CAN TELL WHEN I'M REALLY HAMMERING IT BECAUSE THE REV NEEDLE 
TURNS FROM BLUE TO RED LOOK AT THAT 
THIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL NOBLE EVER 
WITH FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY BRAKE HORSE POWER FROM THE TWIN TURBO V. SIX 
NOUGHT TO SIXTY TAKES THIRTY NINE SECONDS 
TOP SPEED ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX 
THE PREVIOUS NOBLE THE M. TWELVE WAS A REAL WHAM BAM THANK YOU MA'AM 
PUNCH IN THE BACK IN THIS IT'S A MORE CIVILISED SURGE 
BUT THAT'S NOT SURPRISING BECAUSE THE M. FIFTEEN IS 
SUPPOSED TO BE MORE CIVILISED MORE GROWN UP 
ON THE OUTSIDE ALL THE MAD BOY RACER SPOILERS HAVE GONE 
IT'S A MUCH MORE RESTRAINED CAR 
AND ON THE INSIDE INSTEAD OF TRACK DAY HARNESSES AND FIRE EXTINGUISHERS 
YOU GET AIR CONDITIONING SAT NAV AND THAT MOST MODERN OF FEATURES 
A BOOT 
YOU GET MORE OF EVERYTHING 
BUT THEN IT COSTS MORE MONEY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
WHICH MEANS THE M. FIFTEEN DESIGNED IN A SHED IN LEICESTER 
IS GOING HEAD TO HEAD WITH THE MIGHTY PORSCHE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
BASICALLY NOBLE HAS GOT AMBITIONS 
AND WHEN SMALL CAR COMPANIES GET AMBITIOUS 
THAT'S USUALLY A BIG WORRY 
IT'S EASY FOR A SMALL CAR COMPANY TO BUILD A HARDCORE TRACK DAY CAR 
JUST GET A BIG ENGINE AND SOME SCAFFOLDING 
BUT IT'S MUCH HARDER TO BUILD ONE THAT YOU CAN LIVE WITH EVERY DAY 
RAIN SHINE OR SNOW 
NEVERTHELESS NOBLE HAS STEPPED OUT ONTO THE TIGHTROPE 
AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THEY HAVEN'T FALLEN OFF 
SUPERB 
TURN IT AND IT JUST GRIPS AND GRIPS AND GRIPS 
THEN THERE'S A TINY BIT OF UNDERSTEER 
TO TELL YOU YOU'RE BEING A BIT OF A SPANNER 
IT JUST KEEPS ON GRIPPING 
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THIS IS BORING OH NO NOT BY ANY MEANS 
WHEN YOU WANNA HAVE FUN 
YOU CAN HAVE ANY AMOUNT OF IT THIS IS AMAZING 
WELL IT'S STILL A PROPER NOBLE 
AND YET FOR ALL THAT THE RIDE IS PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE 
THE M. FIFTEEN REALLY IS THE SORT OF SPORTS CAR YOU COULD USE EVERY DAY 
THIS CAR IS BIGGER COMFIER 
THERE'S ENOUGH NOISE BUT I'M NOT BEING DEAFENED 
ENOUGH POWER BUT I CAN COPE WITH IT 
IT REALLY IS LIKE A NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
BUT WHAT AMAZES ME IS THAT A FEW MEN IN LEICESTER 
HAVE ACHIEVED SOMETHING THAT PORSCHE NEEDS A CAST OF THOUSANDS TO DO 
AND THE REASON I THINK NOBLE HAVE PULLED IT OFF 
IS BECAUSE THEY'VE KEPT EVERYTHING SIMPLE 
IF I WAS IN A TVR NOW 
THE INDICATORS WOULD BE ON THE CEILING 
AND THE SWITCHES WOULD BE MADE OF KRYPTONITE 
AND THE DOORS WOULD OPEN INWARDS ON A DODECAHEDRAL HINGE 
BUT NO IF I PULL UP IN A NOBLE THE DOOR IS JUST A DOOR 
THAT OPENS SORT OF DOORISHLY EVERYTHING IS WHERE IT SHOULD BE 
AND HOW IT SHOULD BE 
AND BY BITING OFF ONLY WHAT THEY CAN CHEW 
NOBLE HAVE MADE A CAR THAT IS QUITE SIMPLY 
BRILLIANT 
IT'S ONE HELL OF A CAR THIS IT'S JUST A SHAME I DIDN'T DRIVE IT 
AND YOU WON'T NOW EITHER 
BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF OUR TAME RACING DRIVER 
SOME SAY THAT HIS FIRST NAME REALLY IS THE 
AND THAT IF HE WENT ON CELEBRITY LOVE ISLAND 
THEY'D ALL BE PREGNANT INCLUDING THE CAMERAMEN 
ALL WE KNOW IS HE'S CALLED THE STIG 
AND HE'S OFF 
SMOKING THE TYRES BUT THEN IT SOON DIGS IN 
PLENTY OF TRACTION AS HE BLASTS UP TO THE FIRST CORNER 
HERE WE GO OOH LITTLE CORRECTION ON THE WAY IN 
BUT HE'S HOLDING IT STEADY NOW HARD ON THE POWER TO PUSH OUT THE OTHER SIDE 
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL HOME 
HASN'T STIG MASTERED GREEK YET 
WELL HE'S MASTERED CHICAGO LOOKING VERY NEAT 
KICKING THE TAIL WIDE OOH VERY DRAMATIC 
NOW HAMMERHEAD EXPECTING GOOD THINGS HERE 
SO MUCH POISE AND GRIP WITH THIS CAR 
A LITTLE BIT OF UNDERSTEER 
BUT HE'S ON TOP OF THAT AND THAT IS BEAUTIFULLY DONE 
ONTO THE OTHER SIDE WOAH STIG 
THERE'S NO TOILET PAPER 
NOW REALLY WINDING IT UP FOR THE FOLLOW THROUGH 
THIS CAR HAS MORE TORQUE THAN PREVIOUS NOBLES IN ANY GEAR 
IT JUST GOES AND LOOK AT THAT 
VERY FAST TWO CORNERS TO GO 
RIGHT ON THE EDGE HERE 
OOH JUST GAMBON LEFT NOW 
CHUCKS IT IN 
OH NO HE'S ON THE GRASS 
AND ACROSS THE LINE 
THAT LOOKED GREAT OH YEAH 
WELL WE'LL SEE REALLY GOOD 
SO ABSOLUTELY 
WELL IT DID IT IN 
ONE MIN TWENTY TWO 
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO REACH THEN 
POINT FIVE WHICH IS PHENOMENAL 
THAT PUTS IT RIGHT THE WAY UP THERE 
SO THAT'S FASTER THAN A FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FERRARI FASTER THAN A MURCIELAGO 
FASTER THAN A STANDARD ZONDA 
THAT'S INCREDIBLE IT'S LIKE THIS CORVETTE THE Z. ZERO SIX 
THE GIANT KILLERS ABSOLUTELY I WANT TO KNOW 
THERE'S THE OLD NOBLE 
WHY'S THAT ONE SO MUCH FASTER WHY HAS IT GOT MORE POWER 
COS IT'S THE SAME ENGINE YEAH 
IN THE OLD ONE THE V. SIX WAS MOUNTED SIDEWAYS IN THE CAR 
SO THERE WAS ONLY ROOM FOR THE GEARBOX OF A MONDEO OH GOD YEAH 
THEY ONLY PUT SO MUCH POWER THROUGH IT NOW IT'S MOUNTED LENGTHWAYS THEY CAN PUT A CUSTOM BUILT GEARBOX ON IT 
AND GET MORE POWER OUT TURN THE TURBOS UP 
AND YOU GET BETTER COOLING IT'S EASIER TO MOUNT TO THE COOLER 
THAT'S BRILLIANT 
NOW WE MUST MOVE ON TIME TO PUT A STAR IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A HUGE STAR AND A COCKNEY 
SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ONTO YOUR PLATES OF MEAT 
AND OPEN YOUR MINCE PIES 
BECAUSE HE'S HERE IN THE STU WAIT A MINUTE THE PHIL COLLINS

MY MUM SAW IT AND THOUGHT THERE'S A WAY OUT FOR HIM 
THAT'LL GET HIM OUT OF TROUBLE 
AND SHE PUT ME IN A DRAMA SCHOOL AND I LASTED A YEAR 
WHAT DID YOU GET EXPELLED FOR 
THERE'S A LOT OF SNOBBERY IN MY GAME 
I WAS LOOKED AT AS A BIT OF A DANGER TO THE OTHER KIDS 
BEFORE I HAD ELOCUTION LESSONS YOU SHOULD'VE HEARD ME REALLY 
I WAS A BIT OF A TOE RAG NO AND I SABOTAGED A CAR 
WHOSE 
THE HEADMISTRESS 
AND I GOT GRASSED BY SOMEONE FROM WEST LONDON OBVIOUSLY 
WEST LONDON YEAH AND I WAS THROWN OUT THE SCHOOL 
BUT LOOKING BACK AT IT QUITE RIGHTLY SO 
COULD'VE BEEN A DANGEROUS THING 
WELL AT LEAST YOU TALK PROPER NOW 
YEAH I DO THAT'S IMPORTANT I'M A PROPER ACTOR NOW EXACTLY 
YOU ALWAYS PLAY A VILLAIN I DON'T HENRY THE EIGHTH HE WAS A VILLAIN 
HENRY THE EIGHTH WAS THE BIGGEST GANGSTER EVER 
HE MADE ENGLAND WHAT IT IS TODAY 
I'D HAVE ELIZABETH I FOR THAT ONE 
YOU KNOW FANTASTIC SAME STOCK MY KID LOVED HER SHE'S PROPER 
DIDN'T YOU USED TO WORK IN THE FLOWER MARKET 
NO THE FRUIT MARKET I WORKED IN SPITALFIELDS WITH MY DAD 
HE WAS A GREENGROCER I THOUGHT YOUR DAD WAS A CAB DRIVER HE IS NOW 
THERE'S A GREAT CAB DRIVER STORY ABOUT HIM 
I NEVER TOOK MY DAD FOR BEING GULLIBLE BUT HE WAS 
WE'RE STANDING IN THE PUB AND HE'S TELLING ME THIS STORY 
ABOUT THIS FELLA WHO CAME OUT OF THE DORCHESTER ONE DAY 
AND HAILED A CAB AND THE TAXI SAID WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO BERLIN 
HE SAID I'VE MISSED THE FLIGHTS TAKE ME TO DOVER ON THE BOAT 
GO THROUGH FRANCE TAKE ME TO BERLIN 
SO THE CAB DRIVER DONE THAT 
HE'S GOT TO BERLIN THE FELLA'S PAID HIM IN READIES 
AND AS THE CAB DRIVER WAS ABOUT TO TURN AROUND AND COME HOME 
A FELLA'S COME OUT OF THE HOTEL AND SAID CAN YOU TAKE ME TO LONDON 
AND MY DAD BELIEVED THAT 
YEAH 
LET'S TALK ABOUT CARS 
YOU'RE A JAG MAN 
I'VE NEVER BEEN REALLY THAT MAD ON CARS 
I'VE ALWAYS HAD OLD BANGERS ALL MY LIFE 
BUT AS A KID THE CAR AT THE TIME WAS THE E. TYPE JAG IT STILL IS 
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S A FANTASTIC TOOL 
IN THE PAST THE E. TYPE WAS A PRETTY THING 
BUT THEY STILL HAVE THAT ARTHUR DALEY 
THE JAG IS A GETAWAY CAR 
I THINK SO IT'S ALWAYS HAD THAT SEXINESS ABOUT IT EXACTLY 
IN THE BACK CROMBIES AND ALL THAT THE SWAG IN THE BOOT 
I CAN NEVER WORK THAT ONE OUT 
NEAR WHERE I LIVE IS A HUMPBACK BRIDGE WHICH GOES OVER A STATION 
WHICH IS QUITE HUMPY AND MY MATE HE WAS DRIVING MY OLD JAG 
AND WE WENT FLYING OVER THE HUMPBACK AND IT HIT THE FLOOR AND TURNED OFF 
THE WHOLE CAR SWITCHED OFF 
THERE WAS A FELLA FOLLOWING US IN A VAN I SAID HE'S KILLED THE CAR HE SAID HE AIN'T 
HE SAID THERE'S A BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM OF A JAG AND IT'S A SWITCH OFF THING SO IF YOU CRASH 
IT SWITCHES ITSELF OFF WHICH IS NO GOOD IF YOU'RE A BANK ROBBER 
IT AIN'T IS IT 
I MEAN YOU'RE IN A ONE HUNDRED MILE CHASE WITH THE OLD BILL UP YOUR BACKSIDES 
AND YOU HIT THE CURB AND THE CAR SWITCHES OFF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE 
ANYWAY YOUR LAP HOW WAS IT

IT'S GOT TO BE BRAD SHE'S A GREAT GIRL RAY WINSTONE 
THANK YOU 
RIGHT NOW EARLIER IN THE SHOW WE ROAD TESTED THREE VANS 
AND PROVED THAT WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE SUBJECT 
SO THE PRODUCERS CAME UP WITH A PLAN 
THEY SAID THE ONLY WAY TO LEARN ABOUT VANS IS TO BUY ONE AND RUN IT 
SO THEY GAVE US EACH ONE THOUSAND AND THEY TOLD US WE HAD TO BUY A VAN 
SIGN WRITE THE SIDE WITH OUR COMPANY NAME 
THEN REPORT TO THE TOP GEAR TEST TRACK FOR A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES 
BECAUSE I KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT VANS 
I DID WHAT HAMMOND HAD DONE IN THE EARLIER TEST 
PLAYED IT SAFE AND BOUGHT MYSELF A FORD TRANSIT 
LONG WHEELBASE TWENTY FIVE L. ENGINE AND HAS ONLY DONE SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MILES 
APPARENTLY AND DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I PAID FOR IT EIGHT HUNDRED 
JAMES MEANWHILE HAD STUCK TO HIS THEORY OF BIGGEST IS BEST 
AND BOUGHT A HUGE LDV BOX VAN 
JAMES ARE YOU FILMING WITH US TODAY OR ARE YOU MOVING HOUSE 
JAMES HOWEVER WAS MORE BOTHERED BY MY SIGN WRITING 
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THAT SIGN 
TOP GEAR FURRIERS 
COURIERS OH COURIERS I MAY HAVE 
WAIT WAIT WAIT 
GOD THAT'S A SUPERB THING 
BRILLIANT NOT BAD HOW MUCH WAS IT NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND NOW WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR BOB THE BUILDER REALLY 
WHO EVENTUALLY DID ARRIVE 
DID YOU WASH IT ON TOO HOT A SETTING I HAVE TO WIND THAT UP 
I SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE I RAN OUT OF SPACE WELL YOU WOULD 
THIS IS THE SUZUKI SUPER CARRY 
SUZUKI SUPER CARRY 
OPTIMISTIC TITLE 
LIKE A SUPERMARKET AND A SUPERTANKER 
IT'S A BEDFORD RASCAL 
IT HAS NEARLY A NINE HUNDRED C. C. ENGINE 
ZERO TO SIXTY IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SECONDS I'D IMAGINE THAT'S QUICKER THAN MINE 
WELL LET'S SEE AS IT'S TIME TO GET ON WITH THE CHALLENGES' 
HERE'S THE FIRST INSTRUCTION OF THE DAY 
WE START WITH SOMETHING WITH WHICH YOU SHOULD BE FAMILIAR 
A QUARTER MILE DRAG RACE WHO'S GOT THE FASTEST VAN 
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING 
YOU'RE GONNA COME LAST 
ACTUALLY THERE IS A POINT 
A SELF EMPLOYED VAN DRIVER CAN'T WASTE HIS DAY WITH A SLOW TOOL 
MID ENGINE IS RIGHT HERE WHICH GIVES ME PERFECT WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION 
DYNAMICALLY I'M ALREADY AHEAD 
I WASN'T EXPECTING MUCH OOMPH 
UNLIKE OUR CAMERAMAN WHO'S USED TO FILMING FASTER STUFF THAN THIS 
I'M NO MATCH FOR HAMSTER LOOK AT HIS POSTAGE STAMP GO 
IT'S PROBABLY FIFTY B. H. P. I'M LEAVING THEM FOR DEAD 
JAMES AND I HAVE THE SAME TWENTY FIVE LITRE FORD ENGINE 
BUT HE HAD MORE WEIGHT 
GOODBYE MATE 
COME ON 
YEAH I'M GONNA PASS THE FINISHING LINE AND I'M DOING NEARLY SIXTY 
SECOND AVERAGE 
JAMES CAME LAST IN MOTORSPORT'S SLOWEST EVER DRAG RACE 
AND HAMMOND HAD WON IT WHICH SEEMED TO PLEASE HIM 
OOH WHERE DID THAT COME FROM 
THEN IT WAS CHALLENGE NUMBER TWO 
A GOOD VAN DRIVER MUST LOAD HIS VAN AS QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE 
YOU MUST NOW FILL YOU VEHICLES WITH A SELECTION OF CARGO 
AND DELIVER IT SAFELY TO THE DROP OFF YOU WILL RACE EACH OTHER 
I HOPE IT'S A REALLY BIG PILE OF STUFF I DON'T LIKE MANUAL LABOUR 
OUR CARGO INCLUDED ALL THE BITS AND BOBS 
A MAN IN A VAN MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO CARRY 
EVERYTHING FROM VASES TO EXPENSIVE WORKS OF ART 
AND FROM DOUBLE MATTRESSES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
THREE TWO ONE GO 
THERE MAY BE ISSUES HERE 
RICHARD REALLY DID HAVE A SIZE PROBLEM AND HIS VAN WAS SMALL TOO 
PAINTED BY RONNIE SHEPHERD 
JAMES WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH HIS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT 
COME ON 
SO HE DECIDED TO EMPLOY HIM 
MEANWHILE JEREMY WAS BEING AS PRACTICAL AS EVER 
OH THAT'S 
JUST MIND THAT 
WHO SAYS THAT LOADING A VAN IS A SLOW PROCESS 
THAT DIDN'T BREAK YES IT DID THAT DID 
HOW DO YOU SAY YOU GO IN THE FRONT IN ALBANIAN 
GET IN THE BACK HIDE UNDER THE MATTRESS AND YOU OWE ME TWENTY GRAND 
I'M DONE 
HOLD TIGHT 
JAMES HAD INDEED SET OFF FIRST BUT THE WINNER WAS THE FIRST TO CROSS THE LINE AND GET HIS VAN UNLOADED 
SO I HATCHED A DASTARDLY PLAN 
UNLOAD THAT MATE 
EMPTY I THINK I'VE WON SOMETHING 
CANNILY JAMES HAD DRIVEN A FEW FEET FORWARDS SO HE COULD UNLOAD 
BUT HE WAS STILL HAVING TROUBLE WITH HIS IMMIGRANT 
HE THEREFORE FINISHED SECOND HAMMOND WELL HE LOOKED RIDICULOUS 
AND HE WAS LAST 
I TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE NO WORSE THAN THE LAST REMOVAL PEOPLE I USED 
SO THE NEXT CHALLENGE THEN 
HERE WE GO POSSIBLY THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL A VAN DRIVER 
MUST HAVE IS THE ABILITY TO SIT RIGHT ON THE TAIL OF THE CAR IN FRONT 
SO EACH OF YOU MUST NOW DRIVE UP THE RUNWAY AND GET AS CLOSE 
AS POSSIBLE TO THE BUMPER OF A LANE HOGGER IN FRONT 
WITHOUT TOUCHING THE CLOSER YOU GET THE MORE POINTS YOU GET 
HAMMOND WENT FIRST WITH JEREMY AND I POSING AS THE LANE HOGGERS 
RIGHT FORTY S. E. T. HERE HE COMES 
WE WOULD MEASURE THE GAP BETWEEN US USING A SPECIAL LASER MOUNTED ON THE BACK OF THE CAR 
THIS SHOULD BE QUITE EASY IN MY VAN BECAUSE IT'S GOT A COMPLETELY FLAT FRONT 
SO BASICALLY I KEEP GOING UNTIL MY KNEES TOUCH THE BACK 
IT'S LIKE BEING FOLLOWED BY A SMALL INSECT 
AND HE'S NOT FRIGHTENING ME GRRRR 
HE'S THREE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLIMETRES AWAY WHICH IS A VAST YAWNING CHASM 
YOU COULD PARK A BUS IN THAT GAP HAMMOND 
HAMMOND RESPONDED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE 
TEN POINT THREE FOUR MILLIMETRES HE DID A ONE HUNDRED THREE 
NEXT IT WAS JEREMY WITH ONE HUNDRED THREE MILLIMETRES TO BEAT 
HERE HE COMES THAT'S A FAMILIAR SIGHT ON A ROAD 
SIXTY MILLIMETRES THE PROBLEM WITH A TRANSIT IS YOU CANNOT SEE 
WHERE THE FRONT IS THERE'S NOTHING 
WHAT'S HE DOING 
WITH MOST OF MY TORSO OUT OF THE WINDOW I HAD A MUCH CLEARER VIEW 
NOW HE'S HIT IT HE'S HIT US IT SAID NOUGHT 
HE MUST HAVE BENT THE BUMPER SLIGHTLY COS IT WENT TO MINUS SIX MILLIMETRES 
FINALLY IT WAS JAMES' TURN AND HE HAD AN EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM THAN ME 
I CAN'T CATCH UP 
WHAT'S IT SAYING DOES IT MEASURE IT IN MILES 
COME ON 
WE ARE GOING TO RUN OUT OF RUNWAY BEFORE JAMES GETS ANYWHERE NEAR US 
I REALLY CAN'T TERRORISE THEM AT THIS RATE 
CAPTAIN SLOW LIVING UP TO HIS NAME THERE AND NOW THE NEXT CHALLENGE 
VAN DRIVERS NEVER WASTE THEIR PROFITS ON VEHICLE MAINTENANCE 
SO YOU MUST EACH CHANGE THE FRONT DOOR OF YOUR OWN VAN 
YOU'LL BE RACING AGAINST EACH OTHER 
THAT'S MORE MANUAL LABOUR YES IT IS 
THREE TWO ONE GO 
CAN I BE EXCUSED THIS OH LOOK 
THE PRODUCER SAID NO SO WHILE THE OTHERS SET TO WORK WITH SPANNERS 
I BROKE OUT MY INGENUITY 
JAMES CAN I BORROW YOUR VAN 
THINK THAT DID THE TRICK 
THAT'S OFF 
SOON WE WERE ALL TRYING TO ATTACH THE NEW DOORS WITH VARYING DEGREES OF INTELLIGENCE 
IMPOSSIBLE 
YARGHHH 
IT SAID THE DOOR IN PLACE GO AND OPEN IT 
WHAT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT OPENING IT IT SAID FIT A NEW DOOR 
OH FOR PETE'S SAKE JAMES MEANWHILE WAS TAKING SO LONG 
THAT HE RAN OUT OF TIME 
I WAS ABOUT TO FINISH NO YOU WEREN'T YOU WERE FIDDLING WITH YOUR SPANNERS 
POLISHING THEM 
HE'D GIVEN THEM ALL NAMES THIS IS JEFFREY IAN STEVEN 
GET ON WITH IT THIEVING IAN WILL NOW ATTEMPT TO BREAK INTO THE BACK DOORS OF YOUR VANS 
THE LONGER IT TAKES HIM THE MORE POINTS YOU GET 
YOU'LL KNOCK IT OVER 
THIEVING IAN IS TOP GEAR'S TAME CAR THIEF AND BY THE LOOKS OF IT NOT A VERY GOOD ONE 
HE'S PUSHED THE LOCK INTO THE THING THAT'S QUITE FUNNY 
HE'S REALLY QUITE STUMPED BY YOURS 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST PICK THE VAN UP AND PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET 
BY NOW THE POLICE WOULD BE HERE HE'D BE IN PRISON AND LET OUT AGAIN 
HE'S DEFEATED HE'S DEFEATED AT AT ONE MINUTE 
IS THAT TECHNICALLY NOT CHEATING 
PEOPLE KEEP SAYING CAR THIEVES ARE VERY CLEVER THESE DAYS BUT THIS ONE ISN'T IS HE OH OH 
HE'S IN 
I'VE GOT THIRTY FOUR SECONDS THIRTY FOUR SECONDS FOR THE TRANSIT TO WITHSTAND 
THE WORLD'S MOST USELESS BURGLAR 
THERE'S A LOT OF TRANSITS AROUND HOW EASY IS IT TO GET IN 
TEN SECONDS HE JUST WALKED UP AND IT OPENED 
THIS IS IT IT'S THE FINAL CHALLENGE 
IT'S A GAME OF COPS AND ROBBERS ROUND THE TOP GEAR SHORT CIRCUIT 
YOU START THEN TWENTY SECONDS LATER A POLICE CAR WILL GIVE CHASE 
THE PERSON WHO STAYS IN FRONT THE LONGEST WINS 
WHO'S DRIVING THE POLICE CAR SAYS HERE IT'S DETECTIVE INSPECTOR STIG 
STIG WOULD BE DRIVING A STANDARD SIXTEEN LITRE VAUXHALL ASTRA PANDA CAR 
A BUGATTI VEYRON COMPARED TO OUR VANS' 
JEREMY WENT FIRST 
IT'S EXCITING 
THERE GOES FINGERS CLARKSON WITH HIS HAUL 
O. K. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
EIGHTY PER CENT OF ALL BANK JOBS FEATURED THE FORD TRANSIT VAN AS A GETAWAY VEHICLE 
TWENTY SECONDS LATER STIG OF THE YARD SET OFF 
FEEL THE FOLLOW THROUGH OH YES 
OH THE DOOR'S GONE THE DOOR'S GONE 
HE LOOKS SUCH A PILLOCK 
SHEDDING WEIGHT HOWEVER WAS GOOD 
DETECTIVE INSPECTOR STIG WELL BEHIND 
THE FINISH LINE WAS IN SIGHT MARBELLA HERE I COME 
OH NO NO 
NO NO NO 
I DIDN'T MAKE IT 
THAT WAS EXCELLENT WORTHY OF THE BILL 
NEXT UP JAMES KRAY 
HE'S CAUGHT HIM 
WHAT A MAJESTIC SIGHT 
OFF GOES POLICE STIG 
I'VE MADE THE HAMMERHEAD 
HAS JAMES EVER GONE ROUND THE HAMMERHEAD NO 
BRAKING HARD 
WELL HE'S GOT ME IT'S ALL OVER 
I'LL COME CLEANLY IT'S A FAIR COP HE DID BETTER THAN I THOUGHT 
YOU MIGHT DO QUITE WELL HERE YEAH 
YEAH 
SHORT WHEEL BASE LIKE A LITTLE ROCKET 
FIRST CORNER NOW IT'S MID ENGINE I RECKON I'LL GIVE IT A BIT OF THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN FLICK 
HE'S ROLLED IT HE'S ROLLED IT OVER 
HE'S OUT THAT MEANS I'M SECOND HE'S LOST 
SO ERM HE COULD BE DEAD THERE'S A POLICE CAR AT THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT SO 
IF HE IS DEAD AND YOU FANCY A JOB ON TOP GEAR WRITE TO US AT 
I'M BETTER THAN RICHARD HAMMOND WAS 
I MAY HAVE OVER COOKED THAT A BIT 
B. B. C. WOOD LANE W. TWELVE 
WOOOH 
BOOM 
RIGHT IT IS TIME TO ADD UP THE SCORES AND SEE WHO'S WON 
WE'VE ALREADY FILLED IN THE SCORES FOR THE DRAG RACE THE LOADING AND THE THIEF TEST 
THE TAIL GATING IS WHERE IT GETS TRICKY A POINT FOR EVERY CENTIMETRE UNDER 
TEN CENTIMETRES SO I WAS A MINUS A HALF 
RICHARD YOU WERE NINE AND JAMES YOU WERE MINUS 
FOUR MILLION 
HANG ON 
I LOSE FOUR MILLION POINTS FOR NOT TAIL GATING 
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING FOR THE DOOR CHALLENGE 
COS YOU WERE STILL NAMING ALL YOUR SPANNERS WHO WON THAT ONE 
IT WAS ME I WON THE DOOR CHALLENGE HANG ON 
YOU PUT THAT ON WITH GAFFER TAPE 
SO THE WHOLE BRITISH ARMY IS HELD ON WITH GAFFER TAPE 
JEREMY IT DIDN'T OPEN AND IF SOMETHING DOESN'T OPEN IT'S NOT A DOOR 
IT DID OPEN 
IT DIDN'T IT DID WHEN IT FELL OFF 
YOU CAN'T CLAIM THAT ALL RIGHT WHO HERE THINKS JEREMY WON WITH THE DOOR 
WHO THINKS JEREMY WON THAT 
WHO THINKS I WON FITTING MY DOOR ON WITH BOLTS EVERYBODY 
ONE FOR ME 
YOU LOST 
YOU DID 
YOU LOST FAIR ENOUGH I'M NOT SORE 
PLENTY MORE GROUND HERE SO YOU GET THREE AND YOU GET NOUGHT 
THE POLICE CHASE 
THAT WOULD BE A BIG THREE FOR ME JAMES YOU DID WELL TWO 
AND YOU ONE ONE 
YOUR VAN ROLLED OVER I COULD'VE BEEN KILLED 
SO YOU'D HAVE STILL LOST EXACTLY 
EXACTLY AND NOW WE'VE GOT TO ADD THESE UP 
FIVE SIX FIVE AND A HALF SEVEN AND A HALF TEN AND A HALF O. K. 
RICHARD THREE FOUR WAIT A MINUTE 
STRETCHING YOU THIS ISN'T IT 
TWENTY O. K. 
AND JAMES YOU'RE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN 
THREE MILLION SORRY MINUS THREE MILLION 
NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY 
THREE IT DIDN'T GO WELL FOR YOU DID IT 
HOWEVER THERE WAS ONE MORE CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE PRODUCERS 
TOLD US TO PUT A MAN WITH A VAN TYPE AD IN A NEWSPAPER EACH 
AND WE WOULD EACH GET ONE POINT FOR EVERY RESPONSE WE GOT FROM OUR AD 
YES WE DID SO JAMES WHAT WAS YOUR ADVERT 
MY AD WAS
