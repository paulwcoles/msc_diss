EARLY GALLOPS 
I SAW HIM THIS 
MORNING HE LOOKED A PICTURE HE

ATMOSPHERE 
I SAW MICHAEL RYAN ATMOSPHERE YESTERDAY HE HAD A LARGE MUG OF 
SOUP AND EVEN LARGER GLASS OF 
CHAMPAGNE HE WAS CELEBRATING A DAY 
IN ADVANCE ISN'T THAT A GREAT 
FEELING HE IS NOT GOING MAD JUST 
SAYING TO THE CROWD WE HAVE DONE 
IT AND THIS HORSE THREE YEARS 
RUNNING WINNING THIS RACE THAT'S 
SOMETHING 
YEAH AND PUT TIMMY IN SOMETHING GREAT SHAPE FOR THE NATIONAL ITSELF 
I AM SURE WE WILL BE HEARING SONGS 
ANY MOMENT 
WELL THEY'RE COMING IN NOW 
THERE IS SURE TO BE AN ENORMOUS 
WELCOME FOR THIS WINNER 
TIMMY MURPHY COMING IN 
THIS IS THE FOURTH YEAR IN FIVE 
THAT AL EILE HAS WON HE HAS WON 
THIS PARTICULAR RACE THREE TIMES 
AND THE PREVIOUS YEAR HE WON A 
NOVICE NOVICE 
AL EILE THE IRISH LEGEND IT SAYS WELL TIMMY MURPHY DISMOUNTS FROM 
ANOTHER WINNER AND HE RIDES COMPLY 
OR DIE THE PICK OF THE FIVE PIPE 
RUNNERS IN THE GRAND NATIONAL LATER 
THIS AFTER ENGINE NOW LOOK AT 
THE RESULTS IN DETAIL WITH JOHN 
AFTERNOON WHAT A HORSE AL ELLE IS 
NOW IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING SPORT 
AT ALL OVER THE LAST TWELVE YEARS IT 
WON'T HAVE ESCAPED YOUR NOTICE THE 
INTENSITY THE EN QUENCHABLE DESIRE 
AND UNFAILING DETERMINATION OF 
ATHLETES IN WORLD SPORT HE MAY NOT 
HAVE WON A GRAND NATIONAL YET BUT 
A. P. MCCOY IS COMPARABLE WITH THE 
WORLD'S GREATEST ALL SPORTS HAVE 
THEIR STARS IN TENNIS THERE IS 
ROGER FEDERER 
MOTOR RACING HAD MICHAEL SCHUMACHER 
AND GOLF HAS TIGER WOODS 
IN RACING THERE IS A. P. MCCOY 
RACING HISTORY WAS MADE THIS AFTERNOON WHEN THE JOCKEY 
TONY MCCOY BROKE THE RECORD FOR THE 
NUMBER OF WINNERS IN A SEASON 
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY WINNERS FOR THE YEAR 
I THINK 
TONY MCCOY IS SUCH A SPECIAL 
SPORTSMAN HE REMINDS ME VERY MUCH 
OF TIGER WOODS HE NEVER GIVES UP 
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP RIDING MORE 
WINNERS THAN ANYBODY ELSE THAT'S 
THE IMPORTANT THING I WANT TO ACCUMULATE A MASSIVE 
NUMBER OF WINNERS SO THAT WHOEVER 
COMES ALONG AND THERE WILL BE 
ANOTHER PERSON TO COME ALONG AND 
RIDE MORE WINNERS THAN ME HAS A 
DIFFICULT TIME 
TONY MCCOY HAS A 
STAGGERING SEVEN HUNDRED ONE VICTORIES MCCOY'S MCCOY'S DETERMINATION MANIFESTOS ITSELF IN 
MORE THAN JUST WINNERS ON THE TRACK 
AFTER FALLING IN DECEMBER HE WAS 
RULED OUT FOR FOUR MONTHS BY THE 
FIRST DOCTOR TO SEE HIM EIGHT 
WEEKS LATER HE WAS RIDING AGAIN 
WITH FIRST SHELTHAM AND THEN THE 
NATIONAL IN HIS SIGHTS 
I NEVER 
FELT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET BACK 
ON A HORSE WITHIN THAT LENGTH OF 
TIME I'M ONE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO 
CONVINCES HIMSELF THAT HEALING IS 
AS MUCH MENTAL AND I'M A STRONG 
MENTAL PERSON 
ANOTHER WINNER FOR 
MCCOY HE HAS HAD SO MANY BEFORE 
BUT THIS ONE AFTER HIS BAD INJURY 
THIS MEANS SO MUCH 
HE TRIES AND 
TRIES AND TRIES RIGHT TO THE LAST 
MINUTE 
MCCOY'S DESIRE TO RIDE MINUTE WINNERS HAS BEEN ALL CONSUMING IN 
THE PAST 
THE DAY THAT I ACTUALLY 
RETIRE IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN 
MANY RESPECTS THE WORST DAY OF MY 
LIFE SO I DREAD FOR THAT DAY TO 
COME TO BE HONEST 
BUT THE BIRTH 
OF HIS DAUGHTER HAS ALTERED THE TWELVE 
TIMES CHAMPION JOCKEY'S OUTLOOK 
WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE DISAPPOINTING 
DAYS ON THE RACES AND EVERYONE HAS 
THEM AND YOU COME HOME AND SHE HER 
LAUGHING WITH NOT A CARE IN THE 
WORLD THAT PUTS DIFFERENT 
PERSPECTIVE ON IT 
MCCOY'S SUCCESS 
IN JUMP RACING IS UNPARALLELED BUT 
ONE RACE REMAINS ELUSIVE 
IT IS THE 
MOST FAMOUS HORSE RACE IN THE WORLD 
SO IN MY POSITION IT IS NOT 
SOMETHING YOU CANNOT THINK ABOUT 
YOU GET THE EXCITEMENT BEFOREHAND 
AND AROUND THE TIME OF THE RACE 
BUT AS SOON AS THE TAPE GOES UP 
IT'S JUST ABOUT BEING WITH EVERYONE 
ELSE AGAIN ISN'T IT 
YOU NEED A LOT OF LUCK AND YOU NEED 
TO GET ON THE RIGHT HORSE AND YOU 
NEED THE RIGHT THINGS TO HAPPEN FOR 
YOU ON THE DAY SO ALL YOU CAN 
DO IS PICK THE RIGHT ONE AND PUT IT 
IN THE RIGHT POSITION AND HOPE THAT 
IT WILL HAPPEN 
LAST YEAR WE SAW 
FRANKIE DETTORI WIN THE DERBY AFTER 
YEARS AND YEARS OF FRUSTRATION DO 
YOU SEE ANY PARALLELS BETWEEN 
FRANKIE AND YOURSELF WITH THE GRAND 
NATIONAL 
I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE NATIONAL WON ON AUTHORISED YOURSELF SO WE 
WON'T GIVE HIM TOO MUCH CREDIT FOR 
THAT ONE 
NO IT WAS GREAT HE WON 
THE DERBY AND EQUALLY IT WOULD BE 
GOOD FOR RACING IF TONY PACKAGE COY 
WON THE GRAND NATIONAL 
IT WOULD BE 
BET ER IF IT HAPPENS 
AND A. P. 
GETTING READY TO RIDE DON'T PUSH IT

FOR HIM BECAUSE HE PUSHES IT EVERY 
SINGLE TIME RICHARD HOW IMPRESSED 
ARE YOU WITH MCCOY

HE IS SUCH A GREAT EXAMPLE FOR OUR 
SPORT UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK 
HE HAS HAD THE RECOGNITION HE 
DESERVES AT ALL IT'S ALL GOING OFF 
BEHIND US HERE 
IT IS THE 
PRESENTATION IS BEING MADE TO THE 
OWNERS OF AL ELLE MICHAEL RYAN OUT

PRESENTATION FOR THAT AND WE'VE BEEN PROMISED A SONG BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS SING A SONG DUNGARVEN MY HOME TOWN AND TIMMY 
MURPHY THERE PUTTING UP THE SIGN 
SAYING THREE IN A ROW AND I FEEL 
THAT THE STAGE WILL NOWEN INVADED 
BY THE VARIOUS FRIENDS AND FAMILY

PRESENTATION PARTY WILL NEVER HAVE 
SEEN QUITE THE LIKE BEFORE 
AND HERE THEY GO 
IT'S MY HOME TOWN I LOVE IT ALL IN MY HEART I'LL BE WE SHALLING THAT SOME DAY I BE WILL BACK AGAIN IN MY HOME TOWN MY HOME BY THE SEA 
THERE IS A MAN HOPING HE'LL BE 
SINGING TONIGHT 
SAM YOU'VE HAD A 
WONDERFUL SEASON ALREADY WINNING A 
GOLD CUP COULD YOU CAP IT BY 
WINNING A NATIONAL 
HOPEFULLY WE'LL 
RUN A DECENT RACE ONCE WE GET OVER 
THE FIRST FEW BUT WE NEED LOTS AND 
LOTS OF LUCK 
AND WE SAW HIM IN THE 
BEECHER'S CHASE WILL YOU RUN HIM 
THE SAME WAY 
I'LL HAVE TO TRY AND 
GET HIM TO SWITCH OFF A BIT THIS 
TIME HE IS A BIT KEEN AND SIT BACK 
A BIT EARLY ON AND CREEP AWAY FROM 
THERE 
AND ANY PLANS 
WORK OUR WAY THERE OVER TO THE NEARSIDE BECAUSE HE 
DOES GO LEFT AND WE'LL TRY TO GET 
ON TO THE RAIL 
AND YOU WOULD BE 
THE FIRST JOCKEY SINCE JIM CALLOTY 
TO WIN A GOLD CUP AND A GRAND 
NATIONAL IN ONE YEAR WERE IT TO 
HAPPEN YES I 
COMPLAIN HAPPEN AND YOU'VE HAD A GOOD SEASON YES YES HE'S BEEN DOING WELL ALL YEAR AND 
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING ON 
WITH IT NOW 
FAMILY CONNECTIONS 
HAVE BEEN A STRONG THEME IN THIS 
YEAR'S GRAND NATIONAL 
WE HAVE DAVID PIPE AND TOM T. 
ARCALIS FFE THE SON OF PAT T. 
ARCALIS FFE WHO WON IT TWICE AS A 
JOCKEY BUT MOST FAMOUSLY OF ALL 
WE HAVE THE SON OF GINGER MCCABE 
WAY BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE MY FATHER WAS 
JUMPING UP AND DOWN IN THE LIVING 
ROOM IN OUR HOUSE NEAR PENNY LANE 
BECAUSE HE'D BACK RED RUM IN HIS 
FIRST WIN IN THE GRAND NATIONAL L. 
WAS SO EXCITED AND IMMEDIATELY 
HOOKED WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT 
THIRTY FIVE YEARS LATER IN THE TACK ROOM OF 
THE SECOND GENERATION OF MCCABE 
TRAINERS AND THE TRAINER OF CLOUDY 
LANE WHEN YOU FIRST GOT THIS 
FELLER DID YOU IMMEDIATELY THINK 
GRAND NATIONAL 
NO HE WAS A 
TOUGH PROFESSIONAL SOLID LITTLE 
HORSE BUT I DIDN'T THINK CLASS 
INITIALLY 
AND OV ARE FOUR AND A INITIALLY HALF MILES 
I 
DON'T THINK SO L. DON'T KNOW ANY HORSE THAT 
PARTICULARLY WANTS FOUR AND A HALF 
MILES 
AND AS FOR THE AINTREE MILES FENCES THEMSELVES WILL YOU CREATE 
A COUPLE AT HOME BECAUSE HE HASN'T 
SEEN ANY YET NO 
YOU WON'T DO NO THAT 
NO IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE DO THAT I KNOW PEOPLE DO DAD'S NEVER DONE 
IT BUT I WON'T L. JUST DON'T THINK 
YOU CAN CREATE AN AINTREE FENCE AT 
HOME RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY 
FIRST AND FOREMOST YOU MUST BE 
VERY PROUD AND PLEASED THE WAY HE 
HAS TAKEN OVER THE TRAINER'S 
LICENCE 
OH I WOULDN'T SAY THAT L. LICENCE WOULD SAY HE'S VERY VERY LUCKY TO 
GET A HORSE LIKE CLOUDY LANE AND 
IDLE TALK THEY ARE TWO VERY VERY 
NICE HORSES NO HE HAS TWO NICE 
HORSES AND HE'S PLENTY GOOD ENOUGH 
TO DO THEM JUSTICE 
HE PIPES UP 
EVERY NOW AND THEN HE WAS MAKING 
SURE I'D DONE MY NATIONAL ENTRIES 
AND FUNNILY YESTERDAY IT SHOWS A 
SIGN OF THE TIME HE SAID I CAN'T 
BELIEVE YOU'VE ONLY HAD FIFTY FOUR WINNERS 
I THOUGHT YOU HAD FIFTY SIX I THOUGHT 
THAT WAS A PEARL NO WHEN I NEED 
PROPER ADVICE HE CAN BE VERY 
HELPFUL 
WHEN YOU HAVE A BOY AND HELPFUL HE'S THICK YOU CAN ONLY DO TWO 
THINGS WITH HIM IF HE'S REALLY 
REALLY THICK MAKE HIM A TRAINER AND 
IF HE'S NOT TOO THICK HE GOES INTO 
THE ARMY SO IT WAS ONE OF TWO 
THINGS AND WE DECIDED TO MAKE A 
TRAINER OF HEM 
THE DAY AFTER MY 
FIRST O. LEVEL I WENT TO ONE STABLE 
FOR YEARS AND THEN OLIVER 
SHERWOOD'S FOR TWO SEASONS DESPITE DESPITE HIS BREEDING HE'S QUITE A NICE 
PERSON AND GETS ON WITH PEOPLE SO SO HE TAKES AFTER HIS MOTHER YES YES POSSIBLY HE START OF FREE WHEELED 
THROUGH THINGS SORT OF THING AND 
HE DID 
HIS JOB WELL L. THINK HE DID HIS JOB WELL AND DESPITE WHAT I 
SAY HE HAS GOT HALF A BRAIN AND 
HE DID LEARN THE JOB 
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN HOW 
NERVOUS WILL YOU WITH WHEN THE RACE 
STARTS 
ABOUT TWELVE I'M TERRIBLE ARE STARTS ARE YOU 
WHY IT'S NOT A THING ABOUT YOU WINNING OR LOSING IT'S ABOUT 
LETTING PEOPLE DOWN AND THE HORSE 
DOING HIMSELF JUSTICE 
WITH NO 
HICCUPS AND A CLEAN RUN AND YOU 
KNOW WITH THAT BIT OF LUCK YOU DO 
NEED AT LIVERPOOL HE IS 
UNQUESTIONABLY THE ONE THEY'RE 
GOING TO HAVE TO BEAT 
THE NATIONAL 
WOULD MEAN A HELL OF A LOT 
OBVIOUSLY BUT I DO FEEL LIKE I WAS 
VERY INVOLVED SO IF I DIDN'T HAVE 
ANOTHER ONE I WAS INVOLVED WITH 
DAD'S I WOULDN'T BE THAT BAD BUT 
I JUST HOPE FOR THE OWNERS THEY GET 
THERE WITH THEIR CHANCES 
I'VE SEEN YOU WITH YOUR SON JOSH 
AND IT WAS THE SAME THING WATCHING 
GINGER MCCABE WITH HIS SON DONALD 
YOU DON'T BE STOW A LOT OF PRAISE 
ON THEM BUT THERE WAS FIVE LOT OF 
ADMIRATION FOR THEM 
YES LISTEN 
THAT INTERVIEW WAS HILARIOUS BUT 
WHAT YOU SEE WITH GINGER IS WHAT 
YOU GET AND I LOVED BEING DOWN 
THERE EVERY MORNING BUT HE HAS A 
GREAT CHANCE WITH CLOUDY LANE IT IT IS A GREAT SET UP THEY HAVE 
BECAUSE DONALD CAN RELY ON GINGER 
FOR A LOT OF EXPERIENCE THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT AND HE SENT HIM AWAY HE 
WENT TO OLIVER SHERWOOD AND MIKE SAINT 
OUT AND ADD TO HIS FATHER'S 
EXPERIENCE IT'S VERY VERY GOOD 
GROUNDING 
AND YOU THINK CLOUDY GROUNDING LANE CAN WIN 
HIS FORM IS 
BULLETPROOF EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM 
IS THERE HE STAYS AND JUMPS AND 
HE'LL NEED LUCK AS EVERYBODY DOES 
IN A GRAND NATIONAL BUT HE'S WELL 
HANDICAPPED AND HE'S THE ONE TO 
BEAT BEAT WELL JOHN HAD CHANCE TO MEET ONE 
OF HIS HEROES IN GINGER MCCABE I

I'M IN THE PRE PARADE RING IT IS 
VERY QUIET NOT AS QUIET AS NORMAL 
BECAUSE THERE IS A CROWD HERE SOME 
OF THE HORSES SPINNING AROUND 
CORNISH SETT I SAW TRYING TO GET

TOO MUCH TO THE FIRST FENCE NOT 
THAT THEY PAY MUCH HEED TO IT BUT 
THEY WILL WANT TO DO THEIR BEST FOR 
THAT TROPHY TO BE TAKEN HOME FOR 
THE OWNER FOR WHOM THEY ARE RIDING

SMITH'S GRAND NATIONAL BELIEVE ME 
IT IS HEAVY 
A HANDFUL OF HORSES LEFT IN THE 
PRE PARADE RING KELAMI WALKED PAST 
THERE ONE OR TWO HORSES LITTLE 
UNEASY IN THE PADDOCK NOT 
COMFORTABLE WITH THE PREPARATIONS

STRONG IT IS 
TONY WAS SAYING 
BECAUSE HE WON THE GRAND THE 
IRISH GRAND NATIONAL HE HAS FELT 
HE HAD TO BE LOYAL TO HIM THAT'S THAT'S WHAT HE SAID SAYING ALL THAT I 
STILL THOUGHT LIKE TONY WOULD PICK 
THE ONE HE THOUGHT WAS MOST LIKELY 
OR WOULD GIVE HIM THE BEST CHANCE 
OF WINNING 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
TOUTING KING JOHN'S CASTLE AND 
SAYING THAT PERHAPS TONY MIGHT HAVE 
MADE THE WRONG CHOICE THAT'S THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE LIKE IN THE FIRST 
RACE I SUPPOSE HE MADE THE WRONG 
CHOICE BUT KING JOHN'S CASTLE 
NOT SURE WHETHER HE WILL TAKE TO IT 
OR NOT TAKE TO AINTREE BUT YOU 
KNOW WE WILL SEE IN A FEW MINUTES 
WOULD YOU SAY THE PICK OF YOUR TRIO 
YOUR OWN PERSONAL PICK IS BUTLER'S

A HUGE CROWD THERE 
CLOUDY LANE THE FAVOURITE HAS JUST

GREY ONE OF THE YOUNGEST RIDERS

HE IS A STAYER TIMMY'S ONLY WORRY 
IS WHETHER HE WILL BE TAKEN OFF HIS 
FEET EARLY 
IDLE TALK A TRICKY JUMPER 
UNSEATED FIVE TIMES IN HIS LAST TEN 
RUNS THE MAIN THING FOR BRIAN IS 
TO SIT TIGHT 
KELAMI A FULL BROTHER TO L'AMI

FINALLY THE HORSE THAT CAME PRICE IN AS A RESERVE ARDAGHEY CARRIES 
NUMBER EIGHT ON HIS SADDLE CLOTH 
BUT HAS BOTTOM WEIGHT OF TEN STONE 
SEVEN DAVID ENGLAND JUMPED AT THE 
CHANCE OF RIDING HIM THAT'S THE 
THE SCENE THE BIGGEST COURSE IN 
TERMS OF GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION ANY 
WHERE IN THE WORLD FOUR AND A HALF 
MILES IN FRONT OF THEM EVERY JOCKEY WANTS TO WIN THE GRAND NATIONAL 
IT'S THE ULTIMATE RACE NATIONAL YOU NEED A HORSE THAT'S FLEET OF 
FOOT HAS AN ABUNDANCE OF STAMINA 
AND PLENTY OF GUTS 
EVERY JOCKEY'S 
NERVOUS 
I HAVEN'T GOT TIME TO BE NERVOUS FRIGHTENED YOU HAVE THE FEAR OF 
THE UNKNOWN 
THERE IS AN 
UNBELIEVABLE BUZZ ONE LIKE NO 
OTHER YOU WILL EVER EXPERIENCE IN A 
RACE THE RACE RICHARD WITH ME THREE TIMES 
CHAMPION JOCKEY AND TWICE WINNER OF 
THIS RACE HOW DO THESE JOCKEYS 
FEEL NOW DO THEY NEED TO SEE FENCE 
IT'S GOOD TO TAKE THEM DOWN FENCE THERE SHOW THEM THE FIRST SOME 
MIGHT NOT HAVE SEEN A FENCE LIKE 
THIS BEFORE SO IT'S GREAT FOR THE 
JOCKEYS TO GET DOWN AWAY FROM THE 
STANDS NOW THEY CAN GO BACK TO THE 
START IN A MINUTE AND GET BACK IN 
THE ZONE AND FOCUS ONED RACE IT'S IT'S BEEN A REALLY LONG LEADUP THIS IS 
BAD FOR HORSES AND JOCKEYS BECAUSE 
IT'S TIME FOR NERVES TO SET IN YES YES HORSES A FEW GET ON THEIR TOES 
IT'S IMPORTANT THERE IS PLENTY OF 
SPACE HORSES CAN GET KICKED DOWN 
AT THE START YOU DON'T WANT THAT 
HAPPENING AT THIS STAGE 
THERE IS 
CLOUDY LANE HE WAS VERY EXCITABLE 
WELL MOVING ON VERY FAST IN THE 
PRE PARADE BUT SETTLED DOWN NOW HE HE IS SETTLED AND YEAH LOOKING WELL

COMFORTABLY AT THE MOMENT AND I 
HAVE TO SAY THAT ALTHOUGH IT'S LOUD 
WITH THE CROWD AROUND THE JOCKEYS
