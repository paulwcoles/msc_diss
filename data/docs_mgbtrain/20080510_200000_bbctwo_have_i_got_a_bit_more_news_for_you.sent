TO COMMUNICATE A COMPLEX IDEA IN AN ENGAGING WAY 
WHY DIDN'T THEY SHOW THAT BIT THEN 
AND FINALLY IN OUR REGULAR BLAIR ARE THEY NOW SLOT 
WHAT WAS GOOD NEWS FOR TONY AND CHERIE THIS WEEK 
THEY BOUGHT A HOUSE THAT'S RIGHT THEY BOUGHT ANOTHER HOUSE 
JOHN GIELGUD'S OLD HOUSE

THIS IS OF COURSE THE NEWS THAT LABOUR HAS SLUMPED SLUMPED 
INTO THIRD PLACE IN THE POLLS 
ON FRIDAY DOZENS OF LABOUR COUNCILS WERE CONSIGNED TO THE DUSTBIN 
ALTHOUGH THANKS TO COUNCIL POLICY THEY WON'T BE COLLECTED FOR ANOTHER TWO WEEKS 
DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
THE EVEN HANDED BRITISH PRESS WAS AS IMPARTIAL AS EVER 
A DAILY EXPRESS PHONE POLL ASKED 
TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY CALLS TWENTY FIVE P. A MINUTE 
WHAT ABOUT THE COVERAGE IN THE GUARDIAN 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO FOR THAT 
THREE DAYS OF SOLID ANTI TORY PROPAGANDA 
NO BALANCE AT ALL YES WE COULD DO 
SOMETIMES ONE GETS WEARY 
AND YOU KNOW THEM YOUNG GIRLS THEY GET WEARY 
ANOTHER CRISIS LOOMS FOR THE LABOUR PARTY

OH COME ON WHAT CITY'S GONNA ELECT A VACUOUS BLONDE BIMBO 
WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE FIRST THING 
PAUL AND REGINALD HERE'S YOURS 
PEOPLE ARE QUEUING UP FOR VOTING 
AH IT'S AMERICA OBAMA EATING YEP NEXT TO A WHITE DUDE 
SHOWING THAT SHE CAN GET OUT OF A CAR AS WELL AS SHE CAN DRINK BEER 
NO SNIPERS SHE'S ON HER WAY TO LOAN HER CAMPAIGN MORE MONEY 
DO YOU THINK HE'S GOT A CHANCE 
I THINK HE HAS A GREAT CHANCE OF BEING THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE 
BUT I THINK YOUR NEW PRESIDENT WILL BE JOHN MCCAIN 
I THINK BARACK OBAMA WANTS THE RACE TO BE ABOUT IDEAS 
NEW DIRECTIONS NEW BEGINNINGS AND I THINK UM 
AMERICANS JUST LIKE SOMEBODY THEY CAN RECOGNISE 
SOMEBODY WHO LOOKS A BIT FUN 
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT BILL CLINTON SURVIVED A SEX SCANDAL 
AND THE WAY HE SURVIVED THAT SEX SCANDAL WHEN HE WAS RUNNING 
WAS HE ATE AT MCDONALD'S 
AND HE BLEW A SAXOPHONE IN A BLACK BAND ON THE ARSENIO HALL SHOW 
AND AMERICANS THOUGHT YEAH HE'S COOL 
I THINK JOHN MCCAIN WAS GETTING OFFERS AND HIS FIRST ACT AS PRESIDENT 
WILL BE TO PULL OUT OF IRAQ AND INVADE VIETNAM 
THEY'VE HAD IT EASY FOR A WHILE HAVEN'T THEY REALLY 
HE WAS HELD BY THE VIETNAMESE HE'S BEEN PROGRAMMED TO KILL AS PRESIDENT 
THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE NOBODY'S MENTIONED THIS 
THE MANCUNIAN CANDIDATE HEY LAD I'M HAVING IT LARGE 
ARE YOU GONNA MISS BUSH NICK YOU HAD A RUN IN WITH HIM DIDN'T YOU 
AT THE END OF A NEWS CONFERENCE WITH GORDON BROWN HE SAID TO ME YOU SHOULD COVER YOUR BALD HEAD 
WE HAVE THIS CLIP 
THANK YOU YOU'D BETTER COVER UP YOUR BALD HEAD IT'S GETTING HOT

IN NORTH CAROLINA OBAMA WON THE BACKING OF NINETY EIGHT PER CENT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS

BARACK O'BAMA 
OH NOT WHAT HIS ACTUAL SPEECH SOUNDS LIKE 
I TINK I'LL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE U. S. 
A LOVELY FAMILY LITTLE KEELEY O'BAMA KATHLEEN AND DECLAN THEY'RE LOVELY FELLAS 
DO YOU THINK AMERICA WILL EVER ELECT A BLACK PRESIDENT 
EVEN IF OBAMA WON IT'D BE LIKE MORGAN FREEMAN IN DEEP IMPACT 
A BLACK MAN GETS TO BE PRESIDENT BUT THE COUNTRY AIN'T WORTH SHIT NO MORE 
IT'S THE WEEK WHEN THE OBAMA SLASH CLINTON RACE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FINALLY REACHED EXTREME TEDIUM

WHERE DID YOU GET THIS FROM IS IT NOT TRUE 
LET'S TRY AND FIND THAT OUT I HAD A FEELING I'D MADE IT UP 
HE'S GIVEN AN INTERVIEW TO ESQUIRE MAGAZINE

IN ISRAEL THEY SAID YOU'RE AMAZING JIM CAN'T YOU SORT THIS OUT FOR US AND HE DID 
JIMMY WAS IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
I AVE FIXED IT FOR YOU MOSHE DYAN 
TO RIDE ON A ROLLER COASTER WITH HAIRCUT ONE HUNDRED 
SO HIS VOICE DOESN'T COME OUT OF LAMPPOSTS IN HEADINGLEY 
BUT HE HAS FIXED THE MIDDLE EAST HE SAID 
HE'S REALLY BLENDING IN IN THE BACKGROUND THERE 
HE SAID HE SPENT CHRISTMAS WITH MRS. THATCHER FOR TEN YEARS 
THAT WAS A LONG CHRISTMAS WASN'T IT 
DID NOBODY THINK TO GO OUTSIDE AND CHECK WHAT THE TIME WAS 
SHE LOCKED HIM IN 
IT WAS WORSE THAN THAT HE CLAIMS TO HAVE SPENT ELEVEN CONSECUTIVE CHRISTMASES WITH THE THATCHERS 
DID THEY NOT INVITE THE REST OF THEIR FAMILY THE THATCHERS MARK COULD NEVER FIND THE PLACE 
HAVE YOU MET CAROL NO 
HER MUM WOULD RATHER SPEND TIME WITH JIMMY SAVILE THAN HER OWN DAUGHTER 
IS THAT WHAT THE B. B. C. POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IS SAYING 
MY JOB MERELY TO REPORT SPECULATION 
IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SAY THAT HE WAS INVITED 
NO OR INDEED THAT HE'D LEFT AFTER THE FIRST ONE 
HE HID IN CHEQUERS IT'S A BIG PLACE HE WAS UP THE CHIMNEY
