WE'RE GOING MAD 
NO IT'S NOT THAT BAD 
HELP US MY NAME IS ZZAAP 
WE'RE TRAPPED WE'RE SPEAKING VERSE

REFLECTION

IT'S THE MIRROR TELL ME A WORD THAT RHYMES WITH MIRROR 
HIRROR TIRROR THERE ISN'T ONE 
THERE THEY ARE 
RIGHT COME ON 
OH NO WHAT IS IT 
THEY'VE GONE 
WHEN I WAS FIVE I WAS ALREADY STUDYING PIANO 
I HAD A VERY STRICT PIANO TEACHER 
AND THEN BECAUSE SHE WAS A VERY GOOD TEACHER 
SHE WAS TELLING ME EXACTLY 
WHAT I HAVE TO PLAY AND I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT 
SO I DECIDED IF I WRITE MY OWN MUSIC THEN I COULD DO WHAT I LIKE 
I WRITE CONTEMPORARY CLASSICAL MUSIC 
I WISH MY MUSIC IS SOMETHING 
I DON'T KNOW EASY LISTENING OR COULD BE TOP OF THE POPS BUT I DON'T KNOW SOMEHOW IT DOESN'T 
I WANTED TO BE A FILM MUSIC COMPOSER INITIALLY 
AND I LIKE FILM MUSIC A LOT 
MY FAVOURITE BAND IS RADIOHEAD 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT RADIOHEAD IS THAT UM YEAH BEAUTIFUL MELODY LINES AND EVERYTHING 
BUT I THINK THEY HAVE A VERY STRANGE BALANCE OF THE 
SONORITY I THINK IT'S VERY ORIGINAL AND ALSO THE TEXTURES OF THE MUSIC IS GREAT 
I COMPOSE EVERY DAY AND THEN I WRITE EVERYTHING BY HAND 
AND THEN AFTER THAT I PUT IT IN A COMPUTER FOR THE NOTATION 
JUST FOR THE PLAYERS AND FOR ME AS WELL 
AND AFTER THAT IT'S LIKE WRITING ESSAYS I TRY TO SHIFT IT AROUND 
AND THEN SEE WHAT COMES OUT 
I THINK FOR ME IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THE PIECE TO BE PERFORMED 
SO AT LEAST I CAN HEAR IT 
IT'S DIFFERENT FROM A PAINTER LET'S SAY 
A PAINTER EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GALLERY OPENING 
BUT YOU CAN PAINT IN YOUR STUDIO AND THEN AT LEAST YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR OWN WORK 
BUT THEN MUSIC IS ALL ABOUT SOUNDS 
YOU PUT THREE MONTHS FOUR MONTHS WORK ON IT AND THEN NOBODY WILL PLAY IT 
SO I ONLY WRITE MUSIC WHEN I KNOW THERE IS A FIXED DATE OF THE PERFORMANCE
