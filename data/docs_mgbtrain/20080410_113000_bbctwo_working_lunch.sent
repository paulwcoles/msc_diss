GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO 
THURSDAY'S WORKING LUNCH INTEREST 
RATES FALL TO FIVE PER CENT BUT CAN YOU BANK 
ON REALLY FEELING 
THE EFFECT IT'S IT'S THE THIRD CUT SINCE DECEMBER LAST 
YEAR ARE YOU ONE OF THE WINNERS OR 
LOSERS FROM TODAY'S DECISION ALSO ALSO A REBOOT NEEDED AT THE OWNERS OF 
DIXONS AND P. C. WORLD AS IT ISSUES A 
PROFITS WARNING 
A SIGN OF THE 
CHIME AS BIG BEN CLOCKS UP ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
YEARS 
IT WAS CAST ON THIS VERY YEARS SPOT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THIS FOUNDRY IS NOW 
BRITAIN'S OLDEST MANUFACTURER L. 
WILL BE HAVING A LOOK AROUND FIRST 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS LOREED 
INTEREST RATES BY OH TWO FIVE PER CENT THEY ARE 
NOW FIVE PER CENT IT MEANS THAT THE BASE RATE 
IS NOW AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 
DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX GEORGE BUCKLEY IS 
THE CHIEF U. K. ECONOMIST AT DEUTSCHE 
BANK WAS THIS CUT IN INTEREST 
RATES ENOUGH TO STABLISE THE 
ECONOMY AND STABLISE THINGS 
IT'S UNCERTAIN IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT 
HAS HAPPENED TO INTEREST RATES IN 
THE MARKET IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT 
THEY HAVE FACED THE LIKE WAS YOU 
AND ME MORTGAGE RATES HAVEN'T 
FALLEN MORTGAGE RATES ARE GOING UP 
IF YOU WERE A HOUSEHOLDER AT THE 
MOMENT YOU WOULDN'T THINK THE BANK 
HAD CUT RAIRTS THEY HAVE RAISED 
RATES THERE ARE TWO ISSUES IT'S 
ABOUT REDUATION THE WHOLE SALE RATE 
OF MONEY HOW MUCH IT COSTS FOR 
BANKS TO BORROW AND THE LIKES OF 
YOU AND ME WILL THE INTEREST RATES 
BE PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS 
IT MITE 
NOT BE PASS ON IN FULL KPWHAFPLT IS 
HAPPENING IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS 
IS BANKS ARE NOT LOANING TO EACH 
OTHER IT'S THOSE INTEREST RATES 
WHICH HAVE BEING PASS ON TO 
CONSUMERS THE FACT IS WE ARE 
SEEING MORTGAGE LENDING ALMOST DRY 
UP 
SO IS THE BANK OF ENGLAND UP ACTUALLY POWERLESS IN THIS 
SITUATION SITUATION IT'S NOT COMPLETELY POWERLESS ONE 
THING IT CAN DO IS TO REDUCE 
INTEREST RATES BY MORE THAN IT 
WOULD HAVE DONE OTHERWISE HA IS 
WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT 
THE BANK PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE KIT 
INTEREST RATES TODAY IF IT HAD NOT 
BEEN FOR THE PROBLEMS IN THE 
FINANCIAL MARKETS 
SURELY IT'S NOT 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S FINANCIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY TO RUN THE ECONOMY 
IT'S MAIN TASK IS TO CONTROL 
INFLATION BY CUTTING INTEREST 
RATES IF ANYTHING IT'S MAKING THAT 
JOB HARDER INFLATION HAS BEEN 
RISING RISING THAT'S RIGHT YINK IT WILL RISE 
EVEN I THINK IT RISE EVEN FURTHER 
I WOULD THINK THAT THREE PER CENT COULD BE 
PREACHED THIS YEAR BREACHED THIS 
YEAR YEAR THE IMPORTANT THING IS WHERE IT 
WILL BE IN TWELVE M. N. T. S. TIME 
HOW WORRIED ARE YOU ABOUT THE 
FUTURE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME VERY 
GOOD YOU WERE SAYING INFLATION IS 
RISING THE BANK OF ENGLAND CAN'T DO 
MUCH TO REDUCE THE RATE OF OUR 
MORTGAGES WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN 
IT'S A BAD 
COMBINATION THE I. M. F. HAS JUST 
REDUCED IT'S FORECAST FOR ECONOMIC 
GROTS IN THE U. K. TO SIXTEEN PER CENT AROUND 
ABOUT ONE PERCENTAGE POINT BEHIND 
WHAT THE CHANCELLOR EXPECTS YOU 
HAVE A COMBINATION OF HIGHER 
INFLATION AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT 
HIGHER INFLATION COULD LIMIT WHAT 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND DOES TO 
INTEREST RATES 
AS WE HAVE HEARD 
THIS LOWERING OF INTEREST RATES 
COMES AS MORTGAGES BECOME MUCH 
HARDER TO GET THE HOUSING MARKET 
HAS BEGUN TO LOOK UNSTABLE 
ACCORDING TO SOME THERE IS EVEN 
THE TALK OF A RETURN TO NEGATIVE 
EQUITY WHICH BLIGHTED THE HOUSING 
MARKET IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES HERE IS A 
REMINDER OF THE DAMAGE DONE THEN 
THE SPECTRE OF NEGATIVE EQUITY IS 
UNDERSTANDABLEY FRIGHTENING 
BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE WERE CAUGHT 
IN THE TRAP IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THEIR 
MORTGAGES WERE SUDDENLY MORE THAN 
THE VALUE OF THEIR HOMES BUT THE 
SITUATION WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
COMPARED TO TODAY INTEREST RATES 
HAD NEARLY DOUBLED TO A WALLET 
SAERING THIRTEEN PER CENT SO MORTGAGES BECAME 
UNAFFORDABLE TO MANY WERE AS NOW 
INTEREST RATES ARE MUCH LOWER AND 
FALLING AT THE SAME TIME 
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WAS 
RISING FAST THOUSANDS OF 
HOMEOWNERS BECAME FORCED SELLER 
YET THE ACT OF SELLING EXPOSED THE 
NEGATIVE EQUITY THEY COULDN'T RIDE 
OUT THE SLUMP HOUSE PRICES 
PLUMMETED BY NINETEEN PER CENT THE WORST PART OF 
IT WAS THE REPOSSESSIONS CAUSED BY 
NEGATIVE EQUITY THE TOTAL SUNCHED 
TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE NEARLY THREE 
TIMES LAST YEAR'S LEVEL L. CAN 
ALMOST HERE AND FEEL PEOPLE CRINGE 
WHEN THEY HEAR NEGATIVE EQUITY IS 
IT DIFFERENT THIS TIME 
HOW MUCH NEGATIVE EQUITY YOU GET 
DEPENDS ON HOW FAR HOUSE PRICES 
FALL SOME PEOPLE ARE BANDYING 
ABOUT FIGURES OF TWENTY PER CENT FALL WE ARE 
NOT THERE YET HISTORICALLY WHAT 
THE HALIFAX REPORTED WAS TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
FALL IN ITS LATEST MONTH WHICH WAS 
A SHOCKING FALL BUT WE ARE NOT TO 
THE BIG FALLS YET EXPERIAN 
SUGGESTED WITH THAT TWENTY PER CENT FALL THERE 
MIGHT BE SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE FALLING INTO 
NEGATIVE EQUITY A LOT OF PEOPLE 
BUT THAT IS NOT THE ONE OR TWO MILLION 
MARK THE LIB DEMS HAVE SPOKE ABOUT 
THREE MILLION BEING IN NEGATIVE 
EQUITY I THINK THERE IS A 
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT THE LIB 
DEMS ARE SAYING AND WHAT THE BANKS 
ARE SAYING LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THEY 
ARE SAYING IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
YEARS TWO THOUSAND FIVE TO TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
THEY SAY ONE MILLION MORTGAGES WERE 
STARTED WITH THE BORROWERS EARNING 
NINETY PER CENT OF THEIR HOME THOSE WERE THE 
PEOPLE YOU THOUGHT MIGHT BE IN 
DANGER OF NEGATIVE EQUITY YOU 
WOULD ONLY NEED A DROP IN THE 
MARKET OF ON AVERAGE TEN PER CENT FOR THEM 
TO BE IN NEGATIVE EQUITY ZONE 
HOWEVER DURING THAT PERIOD OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
TO SEVEN HOUSE PRICES HAVE RISEN 
BY TWENTY PER CENT AGAIN YOU ARE TALKING OF 
AN AVERAGE ON AVERAGE THOSE PEOPLE 
WITH NINETY PER CENT MORTGAGES HAVE MOVED CLEAR 
OF THE DANGER ZONE YOU WOULD HAVE 
TO ARGUE THAT PLAYER FOR THE ONES 
THAT BOUGHT A LITTLE EARLIER ON 
THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE DROP IN 
THE MARKET FOR THEM TO GO INTO 
NEGATIVE EQUITY 
IF YOU ARE SAT AT 
HOME AND YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT THIS 
YOU CAN GET THE CALCULATOR OUT AND 
DO A SIMPLE EQUATION ON HOW MUCH 
YOU HAVE PAID FOR THE HOUSE AND HOW 
MUCH IT MIGHT BE WORTH NOW PRICES PRICES HAVE MOVED IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND 
DIFFERENT AREAS ONLY YOU CAN KNOW 
THE EFFECT ON HOW YOU HAVE PAID 
AND HOW MUCH YOU HAVE BORROWED IN 
SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THEY HAVE 
MOVED UP FAST RECENTLY THAT WOULD 
SUGGEST THAT IF YOU HAVE BOUGHT NOT 
THAT LONG AGO YOU WOULD ALL RIGHT 
BE CLEAR OF THE DANGER ZONE LET'S 
HAVE A LISTEN TO A COMPROOERT 
COMMENTATOR PROPERTY COMMENTATOR 
AND HIS VIEW ON THAT 
I THINK THOSE WHO HAVE BOUGHT IN 
THE HOTSPOTS LIKE LONDON AND OTHER 
SUCH PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY WE 
HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT HOUSE PRICE 
INFLATION OVER THE LAST TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN 
MONTHS IF YOU HAVE BOUGHT RECENTLY 
IN THOSE AREAS NEGATIVE EKWITY IS 
A REAL ISSUE FOR YOU MORE WIDELY 
IF YOU HAVE BOUGHT IN THE LAST TWO 
YEARS OUTSIDE OF THOSE AREAS THEN 
THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MORE LIKELY 
TO BE IMPACTED 
NEGATIVE 
EQUITY AS A REAL THREAT 
HE IS 
SAYING THE LONDON HOTSPOT IF YOU 
BOUGHT BEYOND A YEAR AGO YOU MIGHT 
NOT BE WORRIED YELT ELSEWHERE IN 
THE COUNTRY IF YOU BOUGHT THAT FAR 
BACK PERHAPS YOU DON'T NEED TO 
WORRY YET L. CAN REMEMBER THE SOUTH 
EAST BEING BADLY HIT BY NEGATIVE 
EQUITY WHAT DO THE PROSPECTS OF 
YOUR HOUSE PRICE DEPEND ON 
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH HERE IT'S A 
CONTRAST WITH THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN 
INTEREST RATES CAME DOWN FAST AND 
FAR AND THAT DID HAVE AN IMPACT ON 
THE HOUSING MARKET AND ON WHAT 
PEOPLE WERE PAYING FOR THEIR 
MORTGAGES NOW IT'S NOT WHAT THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND IS DOING TODAY AS 
YOU HEARD EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME 
IT'S MORE ON BANKS WILLINGNESS TO 
LEND THAT IS VERY UNCLEAR WE 
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN 
IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS SO THE 
COMMENTATORS ARE ALL AT SEA WHEN 
THEY PREDICT WHAT GOING TO HAPPEN 
TO THE HOUSING MARKET THAT IS THE 
KEY THING 
WE HAVE HAD E. MAILS HAVE VIEWERS A 
COMMON VIEW SUMMED UP IN THIS ONE 
COULD SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY A 
FALL IN HOUSE PRICES IS BAD FOR THE 
ECONOMY 
IT'S A FAIR POINT IF YOU ECONOMY ARE A FIRST TIME BUYER YOU WOULD 
SAY THAT LOWER HOUSE PRICES ARE 
GOOD FOR ME IN THE OTHER HAND THEY 
MIGHT NOT BE YOU CAN'T GET A 
MORTGAGE LOAN OR THERE IS NOTHING 
ON OFFER IN THE MARKET ALSO IF YOU 
ARE GOING TO BE MOVING INTO 
NEGATIVE EQUITY YOU ARE NOT GOING 
TO WELCOME A FALL IN HOUSE PRICES 
AS FAR AS THE WIDER ECONOMY IS 
CONCERNED THERE WERE THOSE PEOPLE 
WHO SAID WE ARE BORROWING TOO MUCH 
THEY WERE ASKING FOR THIS SORT OF 
ADJUSTMENT ECONOMISTS WERE SAYING 
WE NEED MORE MODERATION BUT THE 
PENDULUM CAN SWING A LONG WAY IN 
THE OTHER DIRECTION SO THAT NOW THE 
CONCERN IS ABOUT A SLOWDOWN IN THE 
ECONOMY PERHAPS SOMETHING WORSE AS 
WE GET TOO GLUM ABOUT THE VALUE OF 
OUR HOUSES 
BEFORE WE LEAVE THE 
EFFECT OF ALL OF THIS ON HOMEOWNER 
JAMES MARSLAND SAID HE FAILED TO 
POINT OUT THAT ANYONE A TRACKER 
MORTGAGE THEY WILL BENEFIT 
BECAUSE TRACKER RATES DO HAVE TO 
FOLLOW TODAY'S INTEREST RATE 
DECISION WILL MEAN THERE WILL BE 
EVEN MORE PRESSURE ON THE VALUE OF 
THE POUND WHICH IS AT AN ALL TIME 
LOW IF THE VALUE OF THE POUND 
FALLS BECAUSE LOWER INTEREST RATES 
HERE DON'T MAKE HERE AS ATTRACTIVE 
RATHER THAN BUY POUNDS THEY BUY 
CURRENCY THERE IS NOT AS MUCH 
DEMAND AND THE VALUE FALLS IS THIS 
A BAD THING WE ARE JOINED BY A 
SENIOR ECONOMIST FROM THE 
MANUFACTURING ORGANISATION REQUEST 
WITH THE POUND FALLING SURELY 
MANUFACTURERS MUST HAVE BOOM TIMES 
THEY ARE YOU SAW SOME OF THE 
COMING FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT 
MANUFACTURING IS DOING RATHER WELL 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT EEF HAVE BEEN 
SAYING FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS 
WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS 
MANUFACTURERS ARE BENEFITING FROM A 
LOWER POUND BY EXPORTING TO AREAS 
LIKE EUROPE THE MIDDLE EAST AND 
ASIA 
E. U. OF COURSE IS OUR BIGGEST ASIA TRADING PARTNER AMERICA IS ALSO A 
VERY IMPORTANT TRADING PARTNER THE 
PROBLEM THERE IS THE DOLLAR HAS 
BEEN FALLING SUBSTANTIALLY AS WELL 
HAVE WE SEEN A CHANGE IN THE 
PATTERN OF WHO WE TRADE WITH 
BECAUSE OF THE CURRENCY MOVEMENTS 
A LITTLE BUILT WE HAVE SEEN A 
STRONG POUND RELATIVE TO THE DOLLAR 
FOR SOME TIME MANUFACTURERS HAVE 
COME TO LIVE WITH THAT THE U. S. ONLY 
ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT OF OUR TRADE 
SO THE MAIN POINT IS THAT AGAINST 
THE EURO MANUFACTURERS ARE AT A 
BENEFIT 
WE HAVE IT'S BEEN MY BENEFIT UNDERSTANDING THAT LISTENING TO 
MANUFACTURERS IN THE PAST WE HAVE 
SAID WE CAN'T COMPETE ON PRICE WE 
HAVE TO ALMOST GIVE UP THAT BATTLE 
WE HAVE LOST IT TO THE LIKES OF 
CHINA AND OTHER FLAIS ASIA 
THEREFORE AS A MANUFACTURING 
COUNTRY WE HAVE HAD TO CONCENTRATE 
ON TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED 
PROCESSES IF THAT IS STILL THE 
PLACE HOW AFFECTED ARE WE BY IN 
FACT ANY POTENTIAL RISE IN THE FALL 
OF PRICE MOVES IN YOU ARE KENSY 
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT PLAYING THAT 
GAME ANYMORE 
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT 
YOU ARE RIGHT MANUFACTURING IN THE 
HAUCTION BEEN SUCCESSFUL BY 
INVESTING IN HIGHER VALUE 
ACTIVITIES INNOVATION AND SERVICES 
AND THE LIKE 
WE ARE STILL COMPETING WITH HIGHER 
LEVEL COUNTRIES SUCH AS GERMANY 
EVEN COMPANIES IN THE U. S. WE ARE 
COMPETING AGAINST L. THINK THE 
SHIFT IN INVESTMENT IN HIGHER VALUE 
HAS BEEN BENEFICIAL BUT 
SHIFT IN THE EXCHANGE RATE IS ONLY 
GOING TO PUT THE U. K. COMPANIES AS A 
COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE 
I WAS 
SURPRISED WHEN YOU SAID WE ARE ALL 
HAVING PARTIES IN MANUFACTURING AT 
THE MOMENT THAT ISN'T THE MESSAGE 
YOU GET L. HAVE FELT THAT 
MANUFACTURING HEART OF THIS COUNTRY 
HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT IS WHAT I ARE 
READ DO YOU FEEL THERE IS A 
POTENTIAL FOR RESURGENCE 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE EEF WORK ON WHAT 
IS HAPPENING M. MANUFACTURING THERES 
A BEEN A RESURGENCE THE 
MANUFACTURING HAS COME THROUGH THE 
BOOM AND BUST OF THE DECK KAYS 
REALLY TO SHINE US DECADES THEY 
ARE BEGINNING TO REAP THE REWARDS 
OF THAT IT'S NOT AUGUST PARTY TIME 
THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS THAT 
ALL THE ACTIVITY WE HAVE SEEN IN 
THE FINANCIAL SECTOR IS GOING TO 
SPILL OVER INTO THE REAL ECONOMY 
THAT IS WHY WE WERE HAPPY TO SEE 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND CUT INTEREST 
RATES AND HELP TO BOOST BUSINESSES 
AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE LOVELY TO 
HAVE A HAPPY MAN ON THE SHOW LET'S LET'S GET ON TO THE MARKETS A REBOOT I 
AM AFRAID WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
GOOD NEWS BUT BAD NEWS REBOOT 
NEEDED AT THE OCEANS OF DIXONS 
CURRYS AND P. C. WORLD THE COMPANY AT 
THE HELM OF THOSE HAS ISSUED IT'S 
SECOND PRICE WARNING IN THREE MONTH 
BATTY BAD NEWS FOR THEM AND THEIR 
INVESTORS BUT OBVIOUSLY GOOD NEWS 
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS 
THERE MIGHT BE GOOD DEALS TO BE HAD 
WHATEVER THE VIEW IT DOES ADD TO 
THE SUBSTANTIAL FEARS WE ARE HAVING 
THE SHARES HAVE HAD AN AWFUL TIME 
OF IT 
THAT WAS TWELVE MONTHS AGO AND YOU CAN 
SEE IT NOW HOVERING HERE DOWN 
TEN PER CENT TODAY THAT WAS ONE OF THE POOR 
PERFORMERS TODAY THAT IS 
PARTICULARLY INTERESTING SINCE THEY 
ARE ONE OF THE FEW WHICH HAVE DONE 
WELL THIS ONE KESA WHICH OWNS 
COMET THEY ARE DOWN AS WELL UP 
HERE D. S. G. INTERNATIONAL HAS LOST 
SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF ITS VALUE THIS IS A MAJOR 
U. K. RETAILER IT HAS LOST MILLIONS 
OF POUNDS IN VALUE KESA HAS NOT 
DONE AS BADLY BUT IT HAS STILL 
LOST FORTY ONE PER CENT OF ITS VALUE I'M AFRAID 
A MASSIVE STORY THERE GOING THE 
OTHER WAY THOUGH ARE SHARES IN 
BRITISH ENERGY THEY ZOOMED AHEAD 
THIS MORNING AFTER TALK THAT THE 
GERMAN COMPANY R. W. E. HAD MADE A 
TAKEOVER OFFER FOR THE COMPANY 
THERE IS LOTS OF TALK THAT ANOTHER 
BRITISH UTILITY COMPANY CENTRICA 
MIGHT BID FOR BRITISH ENERGY 
BRITISH ENERGY FIRST REVEALED THAT 
WERE IN SOME SORT OF TAKEOVER 
TALKS ON SEVENTEENTH MARCH WHICH IS A 
ROUND THAT SORT OF AREA THERE AND 
AROUND THAT TIME THE SHARES ZOOMED 
UP AT THAT TIME THEY WERE FIVE POINT EIGHT OH 
THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS 
COMPANY PROVIDES A SUBSTANTIAL 
AMOUNT OF THE ENERGY NEEDED IN THE 
U. K. SO IT IS A STRATEGIC COMPANY 
THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT COMMENT ON 
THE LATEST RUMOURS BUT IF WE HAVE 
A MARKET WHERE THEY ARE NOW UP FIVE PER CENT 
SO THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE RISE ON 
THOSE TAKEOVER RUMOURS RECENTLY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE 
MORE WIDELY HELD COMPANIES KICKING 
OFF WITH B. A. E. A LEGAL CHALLENGE TO 
THE SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE'S DECISION 
TO DROP ITS INVESTIGATION INTO ARMS 
DEALS BETWEEN B. A. E. SYSTEMS AND SAUDI 
ARABIA THE SHARES ARE DOWN BUT 
NOT DRAMATICALLY 
ELSEWHERE B. H. P. BILLITON SAID IT IS 
NOT AWARE OF ANY PROPOSED 
ACQUISITION BY CHINA TO BUY A 
SUBSTANTIAL STAKE IN THE COMPANY 
BUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT HAS PROMPTED 
THE AUSTRALIAN STOCK EXCHANGE TO 
ASK THE COMPANY TO CLARIFY ITS 
POSITION THERE HAD BEEN A LARGE 
ONE IS IN ITS SHARE PRICE RECENTLY 
IT IS DOWN TODAY BECAUSE OF THOSE 
RUMOURS BUT NONETHELESS A 
SUBSTANTIAL PREMIUM ON TAKEOVER 
RUMOURS THERE THE SECURITY FIRM 
G. FOUR S. THEIR SHARES ARE DOWN AND 
SHARES IN THE BUSINESS CLASS 
AIRLINE SILVERJET YOU CAN ONLY 
FLY BUSINESS CLASS WITH THEM SAID 
IT HAD RECEIVED A TAKEOVER INQUIRY 
UP BY MORE THAN THIRTY SIX PER CENT RED ACROSS THE 
BOARD HERE THE INTEREST RATE CUT 
HAS DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR 
SHARE PRICES BUT IT HAS DONE 
SOMETHING FOR MORTGAGE RATES 
WHILST WE HAVE BEEN ON AIR WE HAVE 
BEEN MONITORING THEM THE LATEST 
NEWS SEEMS TO BE THAT SEVERAL 
MORTGAGE LENDERS HAVE ANNOUNCED 
THAT THEY WILL MATCH THE PERCENTAGE 
RATE DROP IN THEIR VARIABLE LENDING 
RATES IN ADDITION A COUPLE OF 
THEM SAY THEY ARE REVIEWING THEIR 
RATES IT IS WORTH FOLLOWING UP 
WITH YOUR PROVIDER A YEAR AGO THIS 
WEEK THE GOVERNMENT STARTED A NEW 
INITIATIVE CALLED TENANCY DEPOSIT 
PROTECTION SCHEME IT WAS INTENDED 
TO MAKE SURE THAT LANDLORDS COULD 
NO LONGER WITHHOLD TEN ANDS' 
DEPOSITS UNFAIRLY WHEN THEY MOVED 
OUT TENNANTS' DEPOSITS LET'S 
GIVE YOU SOME DETAILS TENNANTS' 
THERE ARE THREE SCHEMES AND THEY 
APPLY TO TENANTS' 
UNDER THIS SCHEME THE DEPOSIT IS 
KEPT WITHIN THE SCHEME UNTIL THE 
TENANT LEAVES THE PROPERTY NEXT 
WE HAVE AN INSURANCE BACKED A 
SCHEME MYDEPOSITSCO.UK WHERE THE 
LANDLORD CAN KEEP THE DEPOSIT BUT 
MUST PAY A FEE AND FINALLY THERE 
IS THE TENANCY DEPOSIT SCHEME THIS 
IS RUN BY THE DISPUTE SERVICE 
WHERE THE LANDLORD PAYS A PREMIUM 
ALL OF THE SCHEMES INCLUDE EIGHT 
DISPUTE RESOLUTION SERVICE TO SOLVE 
ANY PROBLEMS JOINING ME NOW IS THE 
CHAIR OF ONE OF THOSE SCHEMES 
DAVID SALUSBURY HE IS THE CHAIR OF 
MYDEPOSITS.CO.UK 
WE SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT YOU 
HAVE A CLEAR INTEREST IN ONE OF 
THOSE SCHEMES OVERALL OUR TENANTS 
BETTER OFF THAN A YEAR AGO WELL WELL THIS WAS A VERY VEXED SUBJECT AND 
THE NUMBER OF TENANCY DEPOSITS 
WHICH HAVE NOW BEEN PROTECTED WOULD 
INDICATE THAT THE SCHEME IS 
BEGINNING TO TAKE HOLD AND 
THEREFORE GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF A 
THIRD PARTY FOR THE RESOLUTION OF 
DISPUTES AT THE END OF THE TENANCY 
THEN YES TENANTS MUST BE BETTER 
OFF AND INDEED IT MUST ALSO BE IN 
THE LONGER TERM INTERESTS OF 
LANDLORDS AND AGENTS AS WELL 
DO YOU HAVE ANY FIGURES OR EVIDENCE 
ABOUT HOW MUCH BETTER TENANTS ARE 
OFF UNDER THIS SCHEME IT MAY BE 
THAT THAT THE DEPOSIT IS SUPPOSEDLY 
PROTECTED BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE 
CERTAINLY IN MY CASE I NEVER GOT 
MY DEPOSIT BACK 
I WOULD SAY THE 
SITUATION HAS IMPROVED WE HAD TO 
RECOGNISED IN THE NATIONAL 
LANDLORDS ASSOCIATION THAT THERE 
WAS A PROBLEM OVER THE WRONGFUL 
WITHHOLDING OF TENANCY DEPOSITS AT 
THE END OF THE TENANCY ALTHOUGH 
THE PROBLEM WAS PROBABLY 
EXAGGERATED NEVERTHELESS THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS PROBABLY RIGHT TO 
DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT 
SAFEGUARDING DEPOSITS FOR TENANTS 
NOW IF THIS IS THE CASE THAT 
TENANTS CAN BE MORE CONFIDENT THAT 
IF THERE IS A DISPUTE AT THE END OF 
THE TENANCY THAT THERE IS A THIRD 
PARTY AND READY TO INTERVENE WITH 
WHICH THE LANDLORD HAS BEEN 
REQUIRED TO REGISTER THE DEPOSIT 
AND WILL INTERVENE FAIRLY AND 
IMPARTIALLY THEN THAT HAD TO BE 
BENEFICIAL TO THE TENANT HAS TO 
BE 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT BOTH BE SIDES WE HAVE HAD BOTH SIDES THE 
FIRST E. MAIL IS FROM A LANDLORD 
WHO WITHHELD FIFTY FOR CLEANING AND 
DAMAGES COULD NOT TRACK THE TENANT 
DOWN HE WENT A WALL WENT TO THE 
DEPOSIT PROTECTION SERVICE BUT DID 
NOT GET MUCH JOY WENT A. W. O. L. 
I 
I WOULD SAY THAT IF THE CORRECT 
PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED AND PROPER 
RECORDS WERE KEPT THEN IT SHOULD 
BE POSSIBLE FOR THE LANDLORD TO 
RECOVER PART OF THE DEPOSIT IN THAT 
INSTANCE BUT WITH THE AVERAGE 
DEPOSIT BEING NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOES NOT 
SEEM A PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT 
AMOUNT IT MAY BE THAT THE LANDLORD 
COULD HAVE COME TO AN ARRANGEMENT 
WITH THE TENANT TO SAY I AM GOING 
TO WITHHOLD FIFTY FOR CLEANING QUO 
FAINT AND SORTED OUT BEFORE IT CAME 
TO A DISPUTE FOR CLEANING AND SORT IT OUT 
THIS ONE SAYS THEY TOOK OUT A 
TENANCY COULD NOT GET THE DEPOSIT 
BACK GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE 
LANDLORD HAD TO SEND A LETTER TO 
THE ADDRESS RECEIVED THE DEPOSIT 
BACK OF EIGHT HUNDRED TO FIFTY BUT SHE IS 
CONFUSED BECAUSE SHE SIGNED UP TO 
THE SCHEME AND SHE SAYS HER 
LANDLORD WAS ABLE TO WITHHOLD PART 
OF THE DEPOSIT WITHOUT GOING TO ANY 
PROCEEDINGS IS THIS NOT A 
SITUATION WHICH THE SCHEME WAS SET 
UP TO PREVENT 
ON THE FACE OF IT 
IT IS INDEED AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THE TENANCY THE LANDLORD SHOULD 
HAVE GIVEN HER THE INFORMATION SHE 
NEEDED ABOUT WHAT TO DO AT THE END 
OF THE TENANCY IF THERE WERE A 
DISPUTE AND THE LANDLORD SHOULD 
HAVE PROPERLY REGISTERED THAT 
DEPOSIT WITH THE SCHEME THE 
SCHEMES ARE RELIANT UPON TENANTS TO 
POLICE THEM 
TODAY IS THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY OF BIG 
BEN YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT BIG BEN 
IS ACTUALLY THE NAME OF THE BELL 
NOT THE TOWER AT THE PALACE OF 
WESTMINSTER IT WAS CAST IN EAST 
LONDON AT A COMPANY THAT TODAY 
CLAIMS THE ACCOLADE OF BRITAIN'S 
OLDEST MANUFACTURER WE WENT TO PAY 
A VISIT 
THIS IS THE WHITECHAPEL FOUNDRY 
ONE OF ANY TWO BELL MAKERS LEFT IN 
BRITAIN IT HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS 
FOR OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS IT MAKES BELL'S 
OF ALL SIZES WHICH ARE SOLD ALL 
OVER THE WORLD IT IS MOST ITS 
MOST WELL KNOWN PRODUCT IS THE BELL 
OF THE GREAT CLOCK OF WESTMINSTER 
MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS BIG BEN AT 
THIRTEEN POINT FIVE TONNES IT IS THE BIGGEST BELL 
THEY HAVE EVER CAST AND THE 
COMPANY FEEL GREAT AFFECTION FOR IT 
MY KINDA FEEL IT IS PART OF US IT 
IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST FAMOUS BELL 
WE HAVE EVER CAST CLEARLY WE DO 
NOT OWN IT BUT I THINK WE FEEL 
INWARDLY KIND OF POSSESSIVE TOWARDS 
IT THAT IT IS OUR BELL AND THAT 
WHEN IT STRIKES COURT OF US SOUNDS 
OUT I THINK IT HAS GIVEN THIS 
COMPANY PART OF US WE ARE A 
VERY SMALL COMPANY IT HAS GIVEN 
THE COMPANY A WORLDWIDE NOTORIETY 
THAT IT MAY NOT HAVE OTHERWISE HAD 
MOST PEOPLE IN MOST COUNTRIES HAVE 
HEARD OF BIG BEN AND THROUGH BIG 
BEN THEREFORE THEY WILL HAVE 
HEARD OF US 
IT WAS NEARLY A 
DIFFERENT STORY THE ORIGINAL BELL 
FOR THE CLOCK TOWER AT THE PALACE 
OF WESTMINSTER WAS CAST AT A 
FOUNDRY IN THE NORTH EAST OF 
ENGLAND BUT UPON TESTING IT 
CRACKED SO WHITE CHAPEL STEPPED IN 
THIS IS OUR SALES DAYBOOK FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT 
AND HERE RECORDED ON TWENTIETH MAY IS 
AN ENTRY TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE 
THE COMMISSIONERS OF HER MAJESTY'S 
WORKS AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND IT 
SIMPLY SAYS TO BELL ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
TONNES AND IT GIVES RATE SO 
THAT COMES TO TWO THOUSAND JUST OVER 
BUT BECAUSE THIS IS A RECASTING OF 
THE FIRST BELL WE GAVE CREDIT FOR 
THE METAL THAT CAME BACK FROM THE 
OLD GIRL WHICH MEANT THAT ACTUALLY 
TO MAKE BIG BEN RECHARGED FIVE HUNDRED AND 
SOME TO TWO 
IN THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS SINCE 
BIG BEN WAS CAST VERY LITTLE HAS 
CHANGED THERE ARE STILL WORKING IN 
THE SAME SPACE AND THE PROCESS OF 
MAKING A BELL IS THE SAME IT'S 
JUST THE MATERIALS THAT ARE 
DIFFERENT FOR INSTANCE THIS CASE 
INSTEAD OF BEING WATERLINE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN CLAY THE FURNACES 
INSTEAD OF BEING METAL WOULD HAVE 
BEEN BREAK INSTEAD OF BEING 
FUELLED BY OIL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
FUELLED BY WOOD OR COCOA THESE 
CASES IN WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY 
MAKING SOME COMMEMORATIVE BIG BENS 
INSTEAD OF BEING METAL THEY WOULD 
HAVE BEEN WOOD COKE THE FOUNDRY 
COULD NOT PUT A PRICE ON A MODERN 
DAY BIG BEN BUT A STAND APPEAL OF 
EIGHT BELLS WOULD TODAY COST AROUND 
EIGHTY THOUSAND 
THE COMPANY'S MAIN PRODUCT IS STILL 
TOWER BELLS THEIR MAIN CLIENT IS 
THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND BUT UP TO A 
THIRD OF THEIR OUTPUT IS EXPORTED 
DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCT 
EVEN A WORLDWIDE MARKET DOES NOT 
ENSURE CONSTANT DEMAND 
THERE ARE 
SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES OF RUNNING A 
FOUNDRY RUNNING HEAVY 
MANUFACTURING BUSINESS TRYING TO 
DO SO IN THE MIDDLE OF LONDON ONE 
OF THOSE DISADVANTAGES OF BEING A 
BELL FOUNDRY IS THAT YOUR PRODUCTS 
LAST TOO LONG YOU BUY A BELL AND 
IT IS THEREFORE MAYBE HUNDREDS OF 
YEARS THERE ARE BELLS THAT WE CAST 
THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND THEY ARE 
STILL IN DAILY USE AND THERE IS 
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM 
WHICH IS FAIRLY DEPRESSING IT 
MEANS THAT YOU DO NOT GET ENORMOUS 
AMOUNTS 
OF REPEAT BUSINESS BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE LONGEVITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS 
WHITECHAPEL HAVE A MAINTENANCE 
OPERATION ON SITE AND OFFSIDE THEY 
RESTORED TOWER BELLS AND THEIR 
HANGINGS AND TAKE IN MUSICAL BELLS 
THIS IS WHERE HEAVY ENGINEERING 
MAKES WAY FOR FINE TUNING THIS THIS ENABLES US TO JUNE THE BELL WHEN 
WE STRIKE A NOTE WE GET A TRACE ON 
THE MACHINE TUNE WHICH TELLS US 
THE POSITION OF THE ACTUAL BILL 
AND WE KNOW HOW MUCH WE CAN REMOVE 
TO GET IT TO THE ACTUAL NOTE WHICH 
WOULD BE ZERO 
SO THE ALFA HALF 
FLICKERED LESS SERVICES AN A 
ABSOLUTELY YES 
IT IS THIS MIX OF 
SERVICES AND PRODUCTS WHICH THE 
FOUNDRY HOPES WILL CARRY THEM 
THROUGH THE NEXT CENTURY BUT 
WHATEVER THEY DO IT IS MORE THAN 
LIKELY THAT THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR OLD BOW 
JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF LONDON WILL 
BE THEIR PRODUCT THAT EVERYONE 
RECOGNISES BELL L. AM BACK ON 
MONDAY YOUR BACK TOMORROW 
YES AT 
TWELVE POINT THREE OH SEE YOU THEN TAKE CARE 
BYE BYE
