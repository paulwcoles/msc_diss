ITS JOB IS TO LAY DOWN THE LAW WHERE THERE IS NO LAW 
BUT ARE THE WORLD'S PEACEMAKERS UP TO THE JOB 
I CAN'T REMEMBER A SINGLE UN INVESTIGATION 
THAT ENDED UP WITH EFFECTIVE ACTION 
IN THIS CHAOTIC AFRICAN COUNTRY 
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT THE GOLD MINES AND DISARM WARRING MILITIAS 
YES IT'S TRUE THEY DID GIVE US ARMS 
BUT THEY ENDED UP ACCUSED OF DOING JUST THE OPPOSITE 
AND THEN BURYING THE TRUTH 
DYSFUNCTIONAL MANAGEMENT 
UNACCOUNTABLE DECISION MAKING DISTRUST INTERNAL CONFLICT 
CONSTANT DISAGREEMENTS OVER WHAT INVESTIGATORS CAN AND CANNOT DO 
DOES THAT NOT SUGGEST AN ORGANISATION IN TOTAL DISARRAY 
IT'S THE ORGANISATION THE WORLD TURNS TO TO DO ITS DIRTY WORK 
AND IT COSTS YOU AND ME THE BRITISH TAXPAYER 
AROUND SIX HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR 
THAT PAYS FOR PEACEKEEPING TROOPS TO PROTECT THOSE CAUGHT UP IN WAR 
OFTEN THE UN SAYS THEY ARE ALL THAT STANDS BETWEEN THEM AND HELL 
BUT ON TOO MANY OCCASIONS UN STAFF 
ARE BEING ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION AND WRONGDOING 
NOW PANORAMA CAN REVEAL THAT THE UN'S OWN INTERNAL POLICE FORCE 
HAS BEEN BRANDED A COMBAT ZONE 
THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO 
IT SHOULD BE ONE OF THE RICHEST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD 
A NATION THE SIZE OF WESTERN EUROPE 
ITS SOIL GIVES UP PRECIOUS MINERALS ON A MASSIVE SCALE 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF GOLD ARE MINED HERE EVERY YEAR 
WHEN YOU BUY GOLD JEWELLERY THERE'S A CHANCE IT COMES FROM HERE 
BUT ONLY ABOUT TEN PER CENT IS LEGALLY EXPORTED 
THE REST IS SMUGGLED OUT 
GOLD IS CONGO'S CURSE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
OVER FOUR MILLION PEOPLE HAVE DIED HERE 
DURING CONGO'S YEARS OF CONFLICT 
THESE GOLD FIELDS CHANGED HANDS MANY TIMES 
RIVAL MILITIA FOUGHT VICIOUSLY TO CONTROL ITS WEALTH 
HERE I MET LIKI LIKAMBO A MINERS' LEADER WHO STAYED IN THE AREA 
DURING THE MILITIAS' MURDEROUS REIGN 
PEOPLE SUFFERED A LOT HERE IN MONGBWALU 
BECAUSE OF THESE MILITIAS 
THERE WAS GOLD HERE IN THIS MINE KILOS AND KILOS OF GOLD 
AND IT WAS USED TO BUY WEAPONS 
YES YES THERE WERE PEOPLE KILLED VICTIMS THAT WERE MURDERED 
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE FORCED LABOUR HERE 
LIKI TOLD ME HOW ONE OF THE MILITIA GROUPS 
KNOWN TO HAVE COMMITTED ACTS OF CANNIBALISM 
EXECUTED ONE OF THEIR ENEMIES 
WHEN THEY CAUGHT THE MAN THEY TOOK HIM TO THE MILITIA 
AND CALLED EVERYONE TO A MEETING 
THEY SAID THIS GUY HAD CAUSED A LOT OF TROUBLE 
AND KILLED A LOT OF MILITIA FIGHTERS 
THEY DID IT BEFORE THE EYES OF EVERYONE 
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN ANYONE BEHEADED 
THOUSANDS OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE KILLED 
IF EVER THERE WAS A TIME AND PLACE FOR THE UNITED NATIONS THIS WAS IT 
ENTER THE BLUE HELMETS AND THE WHITE JEEPS 
SOON SEVENTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS WERE STATIONED HERE 
THE UN'S BIGGEST PEACEKEEPING OPERATION ANYWHERE 
THEY HELPED DISARM THE WARRING FACTIONS 
RAN ELECTIONS AND BROUGHT SOME PEACE AND STABILITY 
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO THE STORY WHICH BRINGS NOTHING BUT SHAME 
TO THEIR REPUTATION AND WILL ADD TO CALLS FOR REFORM OF THE UN ITSELF 
IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY I MET A LOCAL ACTIVIST 
MONITORING HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES WHO WELCOMED THE UN'S PRESENCE 
IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AT AN ISOLATED AIRFIELD 
JOEL BISUBU STUMBLED ACROSS SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS 
WHICH MADE HIM QUESTION HIS FAITH IN THE PEACEKEEPERS 
WHEN I ARRIVED AT MONGBWALU AIRPORT I SAW THE TRADER 
WHO WE USED TO CALL THE FAT TRADER 
WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE AIRPORT IN THE JEEP 
HE WAS PROTECTED BY SOME PAKISTANI SOLDIERS AND PAKISTANI OFFICERS 
THE INDIAN BUSINESSMAN HE DESCRIBED AS THE FAT TRADER WAS KNOWN 
TO BE INVOLVED IN SMUGGLING GOLD 
JOEL SECRETLY TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIM ON HIS MOBILE PHONE 
THIS IS THE INDIAN BUSINESSMAN 
WHO WAS IMPLICATED IN ILLEGAL GOLD TRAFFICKING 
WE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS DOING 
WHY HE WAS WITH THE PAKISTANIS AND WHAT HE WAS DOING IN MONGBWALU 
JOEL LATER DISCOVERED THE GOLD TRAFFICKERS 
WERE FLYING IN TO MONGBWALU 
ON UN AIRCRAFT 
THAT THEY WERE PROTECTED BY UN SOLDIERS DURING THEIR VISIT 
AND THEY HAD EVEN STAYED AT THE UN BASE 
WHILE ORGANISING THEIR ILLEGAL TRADE 
JOEL PASSED THIS INFORMATION TO ANNEKE VAN WOUDENBERG 
AN INVESTIGATOR FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH IN THE CONGO 
WE DISCOVERED THAT 
THE PAKISTANI PEACEKEEPERS IN THE TOWN 
HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN A MAFIA NETWORK TO SMUGGLE GOLD OUT OF MONGBWALU 
HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH COLLECTED DOCUMENTS WE INTERVIEWED PEOPLE 
AND PUT IT TOGETHER IN A FILE FOR THE UN AND HANDED IT OVER TO THEM 
DAYS AFTER WE CAME ACROSS THE ALLEGATIONS 
WE THOUGHT THIS WAS IMPORTANT AND THE UN NEEDED TO TAKE ACTION 
WHEN THE UN STARTED INVESTIGATING 
THEY CAME ACROSS EVEN MORE SERIOUS CLAIMS 
WE'VE SPOKEN TO INVESTIGATORS INVOLVED 
THEY TOLD ME THAT AS WELL AS BEING IMPLICATED 
IN THE ILLEGAL GOLD TRADE 
THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT PEACEKEEPERS HAD GIVEN WEAPONS TO THE MILITIA 
IT IS AN AMAZING ALLEGATION 
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TASKS OF THE UN IN THE CONGO 
WAS TO HELP DISARM THE REBEL GROUPS 
THAT THE VERY PEACEKEEPERS SENT TO DISARM THE MILITIA 
WERE IN FACT SECRETLY RETURNING WEAPONS 
COULD NOT BE MORE SERIOUS 
ANECO BEBI WHO I MET NOT FAR FROM THE MINES 
CLAIMED THE PEACEKEEPERS SUPPLIED THE MILITIA WITH AMMUNITION 
IT WAS A VERY BIG BOX ABOUT THIS SIZE 
THE KIND THAT CARRIES AMMUNITION 
THE COMMANDERS THESE WERE DRAGON MASSASI 
AND KUNG FU NYINGA TOOK A VEHICLE TO MEET AND NEGOTIATE WITH 
A PAKISTANI OFFICER 
THEY WENT IN AND CAME BACK WITH SEVEN BOXES OF AMMUNITION 
AFTER RECEIVING THESE BOXES ALL THE MILITIA INCLUDING MY YOUNG BROTHERS 
TOOK THEIR ARMS TO GO AND ATTACK THE CONGOLESE ARMY 
SO WHO WERE THE MILITIA LEADERS WITH THE COLOURFUL NOMS DE GUERRE 
THEY WERE MILITARY LEADERS OF A GROUP CALLED THE FNI 
THE FNI AND DRAGON AND KUNG FU IN PARTICULAR 
ARE SOME OF THE MOST MURDEROUS INDIVIDUALS THAT OPERATE 
IN EASTERN CONGO 
THE FNI HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ATROCITIES INCLUDING 
SEXUAL VIOLENCE 
THE KILLING OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
ON AN ETHNIC BASIS IN NORTH EASTERN CONGO 
THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST MURDEROUS ARMED GROUPS 
AND ANY INTERACTION THAT SUPPORTS THEM ARMS THEM 
OR PROVIDES THEM WITH BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES UNDERMINES THE PEACE 
THE UNITED NATIONS WAS SET UP 
IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE WITH THE ULTIMATE MISSION STATEMENT 
TO PREVENT CONFLICT UPHOLD HUMAN RIGHTS 
AND BRING PEACE AND SECURITY TO THE WORLD 
FROM ITS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK 
IT CONTROLS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEACEKEEPING TROOPS 
IN MORE COUNTRIES THAN EVER BEFORE 
EIGHT IN AFRICA ALONE 
IT HELPED END LIBERIA'S CIVIL WAR GUIDED CAMBODIA TO RECOVERY 
AND ERADICATED THE SCOURGE OF SMALLPOX 
BUT IN RECENT YEARS THE UN'S IMAGE HAS BEEN TARNISHED 
SOME UN PEACEKEEPERS AND AID WORKERS ARE DEMANDING SEX FROM YOUNG GIRLS 
PEACEKEEPERS IN CAMBODIA SEXUALLY ABUSED LOCAL GIRLS 
PEACEKEEPERS IN THE FIELD HAVE BEEN EXPOSED IN A SERIES OF SEX SCANDALS 
UN OFFICIALS AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF CORRUPTION 
PADDY ASHDOWN SAYS HE WITNESSED PEACEKEEPING AT ITS WORST IN BOSNIA 
I WATCHED A BATTALION OF UKRAINIAN BLUE HELMETED UN SOLDIERS 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIEGE OF SARAJEVO IN WHICH TEN THOUSAND WERE KILLED 
AND PEOPLE WERE STARVING TO DEATH 
INSIDE THE RING OF THE SIEGE RUNNING BROTHELS 
CIGARETTE SMUGGLING OPERATIONS 
AND TAKING OUT OF THIS IMPOVERISHED 
DESTITUTE STARVING CITY WHEN THEY LEFT SOMETHING LIKE 
SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DEUTSCHEMARKS 
BUT THE DAMAGE THAT IS DONE IN SARAJEVO IN THE CONGO IN LIBERIA 
BY THE LOW LEVEL DAILY CORRUPTION TO THE THING THE UN IS TRYING TO DO 
AND TO ITS REPUTATION ON THE STREET IS CATASTROPHIC 
AND MANNA FROM HEAVEN FOR THE UN'S CRITICS 
MANY OF THEM HERE IN THE STATES WHO WANT TO RADICALLY CHANGE 
THE WAY IT IS RUN AND FUNDED 
CONTROVERSIAL BUSH APPOINTEE JOHN BOLTON SAYS MEMBERS ARE IN DENIAL 
WE CONDUCTED TWO PUBLIC MEETINGS 
ON SEXUAL ABUSE AND TRAFFICKING 
BY UN PEACEKEEPERS AND ON PROCUREMENT FRAUD 
IN UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS 
AND BOTH OF THESE HEARINGS BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
WERE PROTESTED BY THE GROUP OF SEVENTY SEVEN 
THE GROUP OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
THEY'RE AFRAID THAT EVERY ROCK THEY TURN OVER 
WILL LEAD TO MORE ROCKS BEING TURNED OVER AND MORE CHANGES BEING MADE 
SO THERE'S A VERY POWERFUL SELF PROTECTIVE FORCE 
AT WORK IN THE UN 
THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL OVERSIGHT SERVICES IS THE UN'S WATCHDOG 
ITS INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION HAS RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR LOOKING INTO ALLEGATIONS OF WRONGDOING 
WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THEIR ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE THEMSELVES 
I THINK IT WAS VERY LIMITED I THINK THERE'S A CULTURE 
AT THE UN THAT DOESN'T LIKE SCRUTINY 
FROM INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE ORGANISATION 
I THINK IN TERMS OF REAL HARD INVESTIGATION 
INTO MISFEASANCE OR CORRUPTION THE UN IS JUST NOT THAT INTERESTED 
NOT INTERESTED OR JUST NO GOOD 
EVERY YEAR THE UN SPENDS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUPPORT 
OF ITS MISSIONS WORLDWIDE 
IT'S A LUCRATIVE BUSINESS FOR THE LUCKY COMPANIES 
WHO GET THE CONTRACTS 
IT USED TO BE EDWIN NHLIZIYO'S JOB TO KEEP THOSE CONTRACTS CLEAN 
WHEN HE DISCOVERED A PROBLEM WITH AN INDIAN COMPANY WHO HAD WON 
A CONTRACT WORTH TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS HE WENT TO WORK 
WE HAD A LOT PROBLEMS AND ONE OF THEM 
HAD TO DO WITH THE TECHNICIANS SUPPLIED BY THE INDIAN COMPANY 
BY CONTRACT THE INDIAN COMPANY WAS SUPPOSED TO PAY THEM 
A DAILY SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE 
OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE DOLLARS THEY WERE NOT PAYING THAT 
THERE WAS NO SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION 
WHY THAT MONEY WAS NOT REACHING THE TECHNICIANS 
EDWIN DISCOVERED THAT THE WORKERS WERE FORCED TO SLEEP ON THE GROUND 
AND WERE NOT GETTING ANY FOOD 
BECAUSE THEIR ALLOWANCE WAS BEING KEPT BY THE COMPANY 
THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTRACT WAS SANJAYA BAHEL 
A SENIOR UN OFFICIAL RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING DEALS 
WORTH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
THE MOMENT SANJAYA BAHEL 
FOUND OUT THAT I WAS AUDITING THAT CONTRACT 
HE STARTED SECRETLY COMMUNICATING WITH MY SUPERVISORS IN NEW YORK 
BASICALLY QUESTIONING MY MOTIVES 
AND ASKING WHETHER THE AUDIT SHOULD BE PERFORMED OF THAT CONTRACT 
WHAT EDWIN DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT BAHEL WAS A CLOSE FRIEND 
OF THE AGENT FOR THE COMPANY EDWIN WAS INVESTIGATING NISHAN KOHLI 
DESPITE EDWIN'S CONCERNS THERE WAS NEVER A PROPER INVESTIGATION 
THE PROBLEM I HAD WAS 
THAT THE OVERSIGHT SERVICES DID NOT STICK WITH ME 
THEY ACTUALLY SIDED WITH BAHEL AGAINST ME 
TO TRY AND KILL THE AUDIT OR KILL THE REPORT 
BUT IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AGENT AND THE OFFICIAL 
WAS ALMOST EXPOSED WHEN A WHISTLEBLOWER 
SPOTTED IRREGULARITIES IN THE CONTRACTS 
AN INVESTIGATION FOLLOWED 
THE RESULT THIS LETTER FROM BAHEL'S BOSS STATING 
THE INVESTIGATORS FOUND NO SUBSTANCE IN THE ALLEGATIONS 
AND RECOMMENDS THAT MR. BAHEL BE CLEARED OF ALL ALLEGATIONS 
BUT WITHIN THE UN 
SOME SENIOR OFFICIALS WERE CONCERNED THAT THIS WAS A WHITEWASH 
ACCORDING TO A SECRET REPORT WRITTEN LAST YEAR 
AND OBTAINED BY PANORAMA 
IT BECAME CLEAR THAT CASES INVOLVING FRAUD AND CORRUPTION 
IN PROCUREMENT SERVICES WERE NOT BEING PROPERLY INVESTIGATED 
IF INVESTIGATED AT ALL 
IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT CASES WERE OFTEN UNILATERALLY CLOSED 
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX A NEW TASK FORCE WAS SET UP TO INVESTIGATE 
ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION 
WITHIN THE ORGANISATION'S MULTI BILLION POUND 
PURCHASING OPERATION 
BOB APPLETON A FORMER U. S. PROSECUTOR RUNS IT 
AND TOP OF APPLETON'S LIST TO RE INVESTIGATE 
WELL THE BAHEL CASE LANDED ON MY LAP IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
WHEN YOU'RE A PROCUREMENT OFFICIAL 
A UN INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC SERVANT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ACT OBJECTIVELY 
PRISTINELY AND FAIRLY 
BAHEL CORRUPTED THE PROCESS BY FAVOURING THE COMPANY 
ACTING AS THE COMPANY'S DE FACTO AGENT IN THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS 
THE TASK FORCE PROVED THAT BAHEL HAD ACCEPTED BRIBES FROM NISHAN KOHLI 
THE AGENT FOR THE INDIAN COMPANY 
HE GAINED A PERSONAL BENEFIT FROM HIS ACTIONS 
NAMELY BELOW MARKET RATES IN A VERY VALUABLE PIECE OF REAL ESTATE 
IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN 
A LUXURY APARTMENT IN THIS BLOCK OVERLOOKING THE UN 
IS WHAT BAHEL GOT AS HIS PAYOFF 
BUT BAHEL WAS NOT THE ONLY UN OFFICIAL KOHLI WAS TRYING TO BRIBE 
WHILE BAHEL GOT AN APARTMENT 
FOR HIS COLLEAGUES KOHLI HAD OTHER SWEETENERS IN MIND 
KOHLI PLEADED GUILTY AND GAVE EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION 
HE TOLD THE COURT HE'D TREATED OTHER UN OFFICIALS TO NIGHTS ON THE TOWN 
COMPLETE WITH STRIPPERS AND ESCORTS 
IT COST HIM SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS 
THIS MONTH BAHEL WAS SENTENCED TO EIGHT YEARS IN PRISON 
BUT WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO CATCH HIM 
THERE HAD BEEN A PREVIOUS AUDIT AND PREVIOUS CLAIMS MADE 
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING AMISS 
THAT ULTIMATELY HAD NOT BEEN ACTED ON 
AND CERTAINLY NOW LOOKING BACK ON IT 
THE COMPLAINTS AND CRITICISMS RAISED AT THE TIME WERE VERY VALID 
NOW VINDICATED EDWIN IS NOT SURPRISED 
THAT IT TOOK EIGHT YEARS TO GET A CONVICTION 
YOU COME BACK TO THE OLD QUESTION OF CULTURE 
SO ANY TIME YOU FIND WRONGDOING POTENTIALLY YOU ARE ROCKING THE BOAT 
THERE IS THIS CULTURAL THING THAT SORT OF SAYS 
IF THAT COMES OUT IN THE OPEN 
IT CREATES A PROBLEM FOR US SO JUST KEEP IT HIDDEN 
BUT NOW THE TRUTH IS COMING OUT 
MORE AND MORE CONTRACTS SOME INVOLVING BRITISH FIRMS 
ARE BEING INVESTIGATED 
WE STARTED WITH ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED CASES 
WE HAVE STILL CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED PENDING 
OF WHICH TWENTY TO THIRTY ARE LARGE SIGNIFICANT VALUE CONTRACTS 
THAT EXCEED ONE MILLION DOLLARS U. S. 
ONE OF THE FIRST STOPS FOR THE TASK FORCE WAS IN THE CAPITAL OF CONGO 
KINSHASA 
THIS INTERNAL REPORT OBTAINED BY PANORAMA REVEALS 
WIDESPREAD AND INHERENT CORRUPTION 
THROUGHOUT THE PROCUREMENT DEPARTMENT HERE IN KINSHASA 
IF YOU WANTED A CONTRACT YOU HAD TO PAY A BRIBE 
TWO MONTHS AGO ALAN DOSS TOOK UP HIS POST AS HEAD OF MONUC 
THE UN MISSION TO THE CONGO 
ANY FORM OF CORRUPTION WILL UNDERMINE OUR REPUTATION 
THIS IS WHY WE HAD A WHOLE TEAM COME DOWN 
WHY FIVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUMMARILY DISMISSED 
IN UN TERMS THAT'S PRETTY STRONG 
BUT DESPITE THE UN'S OVERSIGHT SERVICES BEING WARNED FOUR TIMES 
ABOUT CORRUPTION IN KINSHASA 
IT WASN'T UNTIL LAST YEAR THAT ACTION WAS TAKEN 
DURING THE INVESTIGATION 
IT EMERGED THAT ONE OFFICIAL WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN HIS JOB 
DESPITE ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION DATING BACK TWENTY YEARS 
HE'S JUST ONE OF SIXTEEN OFFICIALS UNDER INVESTIGATION 
WE'VE OBTAINED TWO SECRET INTERNAL REPORTS 
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
ITS FORMER DIRECTOR SAID 
IT HAD ACTED PROFESSIONALLY AND OBJECTIVELY 
DESPITE A LACK OF RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THREE THOUSAND CASES 
NEVERTHELESS THEY'RE DAMNING 
IT'S DESCRIBED AS A. COMBAT ZONE 
WHERE THE MANAGEMENT IS DYSFUNCTIONAL 
PLAGUED BY ONGOING CONFLICT 
BETWEEN SENIOR OFFICIALS AND IN NEED OF 
MAJOR CHANGE AND REFORM WHERE STAFF HAVE FEARED 
THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE ORGANISATION COULD BE 
USURPED BY POLITICAL FORCES OR EVENTS 
IN NEW YORK I MET THE WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN STRUGGLING TO REFORM IT 
NO OPERATIONAL STRATEGY NO CLEAR GOALS 
NO STANDARD PROCEDURES FOR INVESTIGATORS 
DYSFUNCTIONAL MANAGEMENT UNACCOUNTABLE DECISION MAKING 
DISTRUST INTERNAL CONFLICT 
CONSTANT DISAGREEMENT OVER WHAT INVESTIGATORS CAN AND CANNOT DO 
DOES THAT NOT SUGGEST AN ORGANISATION IN TOTAL DISARRAY 
IT TELLS THAT THE INVESTIGATION DIVISION 
HAS HAD VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS 
THE REPORT MAKES CLEAR THAT IN THE PAST 
CASES WERE NOT PROPERLY INVESTIGATED IF AT ALL 
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY BECAUSE THIS WAS BEFORE MY TIME 
BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY ADMIT THAT WE DID NOT INVESTIGATE 
DEEPLY ENOUGH 
AND THE BAHEL CASE AS YOU RAISED YOURSELF IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT 
HOW CAN WE EXPECT EFFECTIVE INVESTIGATION FROM OVERSIGHT 
WHEN THESE INTERNAL SQUABBLES ARE GOING ON 
THESE ARE ISSUES I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH 
AND THESE MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS ARE NOW SOLVED 
THEY'RE SOLVED YES 
IS THAT BECAUSE THOSE WHO WERE CAUSING THESE PROBLEMS 
NO LONGER WORK 
NEW POLICY AND NEW PEOPLE 
BRAVE WORDS IN NEW YORK 
WHAT EFFECT WILL THEY HAVE ON THE GROUND 
THE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT GOLD AND GUNS 
WERE ONE OF THE FIRST TESTS OF THE NEW REGIME 
EARLY SIGNS WEREN'T GOOD 
WHEN THE INVESTIGATORS AND THEIR MILITARY POLICE 
ARRIVED TO SECURE EVIDENCE 
THE PEACEKEEPERS PREVENTED THEM FROM DOING SO 
INCREDIBLY THEY CONFINED THE MILITARY POLICE BEHIND BARBED WIRE 
ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS SEEN BY PANORAMA 
THIS IS THE CATHOLIC MISSION THE INVESTIGATORS WERE STAYING IN 
WHEN TWO ARMOURED VEHICLES TURNED UP WITH PAKISTANI PEACEKEEPERS 
THEY FELT THREATENED AND DECIDED TO LEAVE 
THE UN FOUND FIVE PEACEKEEPERS HAD OBSTRUCTED THE INVESTIGATORS 
THE PAKISTANI ARMY SAYS THEY DIDN'T 
BUT DISCIPLINED THREE OFFICERS FOR LACK OF TACT 
DESPITE THE SET BACK 
THE INVESTIGATORS PRODUCED A REPORT IN JULY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
IT CONCLUDES THAT PAKISTANI PEACEKEEPERS 
DID HELP THE ILLEGAL GOLD TRADERS HERE IN MONGBWALU 
BUT IT ONLY RECOMMENDED THAT ONE PAKISTANI OFFICER BE REPRIMANDED 
THE UN OPENLY CONDEMN THAT 
ANYBODY INVOLVED IN THE TRAFFICKING OR SMUGGLING 
OF A COUNTRY'S NATURAL RESOURCES WHEN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE 
TO WORK TO PRESERVE THE PEACE IS UNACCEPTABLE TO THE UN 
AND CERTAINLY BREAKS OUR CODE OF CONDUCT 
THE PAKISTANI ARMY TOLD PANORAMA THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE 
THEIR PEACEKEEPERS WERE INVOLVED 
WHAT DOES THE REPORT SAY ABOUT THE REARMING OF THE MILITIA 
IT GOES ON TO CONCLUDE THAT INVESTIGATORS COULD NOT SUBSTANTIATE 
THE ALLEGATION THAT PEACEKEEPERS HAD SUPPLIED WEAPONS TO THE MILITIA 
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE FNI REBEL GROUP LEADERS DRAGON AND KUNG FU 
WERE ARRESTED 
THEY ARE HELD WITHOUT TRIAL 
IN A HIGH SECURITY PRISON IN THE CAPITAL OF CONGO KINSHASA 
WHEN QUESTIONED BY UN INVESTIGATORS 
THEY DENIED GETTING WEAPONS FROM THE PAKISTANIS 
BUT THEY LATER ISSUED A STATEMENT ADMITTING THEY HAD 
I WENT TO VISIT THEM IN PRISON 
AND ASKED IF WHAT THEY NOW SAY ABOUT GETTING WEAPONS WAS TRUE 
YES IT'S TRUE THEY DID GIVE US ARMS 
WHY WOULD I LIE 
WHAT FOR THE ARMS THEY GAVE US WE USED FOR SECURITY 
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU YOURSELF WERE THE LIAISON 
BETWEEN PAKISTAN PEACEKEEPERS AND YOUR TROOPS 
YOU COLLECTED THE WEAPONS AND DISTRIBUTED IT TO YOUR TROOPS 
AS WELL AS AMMUNITION IS THAT TRUE 
THEY GAVE ME THE WEAPONS AND I DISTRIBUTED THEM 
THERE WERE TWO OF US THAT RECEIVED WEAPONS 
WHATEVER THE TRUTH OF DRAGON AND KUNG FU'S ALLEGATION 
THE FACT IS THE UN'S OVERSIGHT SERVICE 
APPEARS TO HAVE IGNORED CRUCIAL EVIDENCE OF WRONGDOING 
HOW SERIOUS DO YOU TAKE THOSE ALLEGATIONS 
ANY EFFORT TO REARM MILITIAS WOULD BE OF GREAT CONCERN TO US 
AFTER ALL WE'VE LOST LIVES IN FIGHTING THESE MILITIAS 
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT 
I'VE SPOKEN TO THE MILITIA LEADERS THEY SAY THE ARMS THEY RECEIVED 
WERE THE SAME ARMS THEY DEMOBILISED WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT 
MILITIA LEADERS ARE MILITIA LEADERS 
THEY ALWAYS HAVE THEIR INTERESTS IF YOU WILL 
ERM ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS INVESTIGATION DIDN'T CONFIRM THAT 
THE PAKISTANI ARMY STRONGLY DENIES THE ALLEGATION 
BUT UN INSIDERS WE'VE SPOKEN TO BELIEVE THAT KEY EVIDENCE 
INCLUDING ADMISSIONS OF THE MILITIA LEADERS WAS IGNORED 
AND THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES 
WHEN THE INFORMATION CAME OUT 
THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ADMITTED TO TRADING GOLD AND WEAPONS 
WITH THE PAKISTANI PEACEKEEPERS 
IF I HAD BEEN THE UN INVESTIGATION DIVISION 
I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN TO SEE THEM THE FOLLOWING DAY 
UN PEACEKEEPERS ARE THERE TO KEEP THE PEACE 
WHEN THEY ARE INVOLVED IN REARMING OR TRADING WITH MILITIAS 
THEY DO NOTHING TO HELP THE PEACE 
THE MEN WERE NOT RE INTERVIEWED 
AND THERE'S MORE EVIDENCE 
THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS LESS THAN THOROUGH 
PANORAMA HAS OBTAINED EVIDENCE GIVEN TO THE UN INVESTIGATORS 
BY A SENIOR OFFICER IN THE CONGOLESE ARMY 
HE SAID A COMMANDER IN A TOWN NEAR MONGBWALU WAS ALSO TRADING GOLD 
AND SECRETLY GIVING ARMS BACK TO THE MILITIA 
THESE ALLEGATIONS AGAIN DENIED BY THE PAKISTANIS 
ARE NOT IN THE UN REPORT 
WHY IS THAT NOT REFERRED TO IN THE REPORT 
IF YOU HAVE NEW INFORMATION I SUGGEST YOU TRANSMIT IT TO US 
AND WE MAY REOPEN THE INVESTIGATION 
KEEPING THE UN ON ITS MISSION IS 
FIENDISHLY POLITICALLY AND CULTURALLY SENSITIVE 
MANY OF THE RICHER COUNTRIES ARE RELUCTANT TO SEND TROOPS 
AND WITHOUT THE BUYING OF THOSE THAT DO 
THE UN COULDN'T OPERATE NO WONDER THINGS MOVE SLOWLY 
THEY DESPERATELY NEED TROOP CONTRIBUTING COUNTRIES 
TO COME FORWARD 
PAKISTAN CONTRIBUTES TEN THOUSAND TROOPS TO THE PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS 
AROUND THE WORLD 
THEY'RE VITALLY IMPORTANT TO UN PEACEKEEPING 
WHEN THESE KIND OF ALLEGATIONS COME UP THEY'RE UNCOMFORTABLE 
AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE UN TO INSIST ON INVESTIGATIONS 
TROOP CONTRIBUTING COUNTRIES HOLD THE UN OVER A BARREL 
THERE'S NO SUGGESTION THAT PAKISTANI PEACEKEEPERS 
FOR EXAMPLE BEHAVE ANY WORSE THAN OTHERS 
IT'S JUST THAT THERE ARE MORE OF THEM 
LAST YEAR PAKISTAN EARNED TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS 
FOR SUPPLYING TROOPS 
WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY PEOPLE WHO KNOW ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION YES 
THAT THEY BELIEVE THE INVESTIGATION WAS A WHITEWASH 
AND IT WAS CARRIED OUT FOR POLITICAL REASONS 
NOT TO UPSET THE PAKISTANI ARMY WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT 
WELL I REFUTE IT IN THE MOST STRONGEST TERMS 
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN A WHITEWASH CERTAINLY NOT 
THE PAKISTANI ARMY SAYS 
IT HAS NO MEANS TO INFLUENCE UN INVESTIGATIONS 
THE UN IS ESSENTIALLY A POLITICAL ORGANISATION 
WHICH IS RUN BY ITS MEMBER STATES AND THEREFORE EVERYTHING IT DOES 
IS SUBJECT TO THE POLITICS OF THE INTERPLAY OF MEMBER STATES 
FOR AS LONG AS THAT CONTINUES 
FOR AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T HAVE AN INDEPENDENT FOR INSTANCE 
OVERSIGHT ORGANISATION CAPABLE OF TAKING INDEPENDENT ACTION 
WHATEVER THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES MAY BE 
THAT'S INEVITABLY GOING TO BE A CRITICISM AND A JUSTIFIED ONE TOO 
THERE WILL BE A NEED FOR THE UN SO LONG AS THERE IS WAR 
AND AS ITS LATEST MISSION IN DARFUR SHOWS 
THERE'S LITTLE CHANCE OF IT RUNNING OUT OF WORK 
CALLS FOR REFORM ARE NOTHING NEW 
BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT ONE OF ITS MOST VITAL MISSIONS 
IS TO EXAMINE ITSELF 
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE UN WE'D HAVE TO INVENT IT 
IT IS A VITAL ORGANISATION 
THE REAL PROBLEM IN MY VIEW DOES NOT LIE WITH THE UN 
IT LIES IN THE POLITICAL WILL OF THE MEMBER STATES 
THEY SHOULD BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS AND ABOVE ALL 
THE RICHER MEMBER STATES WHO HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE 
IT WITH THE RESOURCES IT NEEDS 
RAPHAEL ROWE REPORTING 
NEXT WEEK IN PRISONS UNLOCKED PANORAMA INVESTIGATES CLAIMS THAT 
MORE DIFFICULT AND VIOLENT CRIMINALS ARE BEING SENT TO OPEN PRISONS 
TO EASE THE OVERCROWDING CRISIS 
AND THAT SOME ARE ESCAPING TO COMMIT FURTHER CRIMES
