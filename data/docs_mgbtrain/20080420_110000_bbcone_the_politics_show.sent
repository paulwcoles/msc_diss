THIS WEEK ON THE POLITICS SHOW 
BORIS JOHNSON KEN LIVINGSTONE AND 
BRIAN PADDICK THE RACE TO BE MAYOR 
OF LONDON IS TIGHT WHO IS KNIT TO 
RUN CITY HALL 
WHO IS FIT TO RUN CITY HALL 
POLITICIANS MAY PREACH POLITICS IS 
ANYONE LISTENING TO ANYTHING OTHER 
THAN MUSIC WE WILL TALK TO BORIS 
JOHNSON TOO DISMISSED BY SOME AS A 
JOKE HE IS NECK AND NECK IN THE 
POLLS IS HE NOW DEADLY SERIOUS 
FIRST THE NEWS 
GOOD AFTERNOON THE CHANCELLOR 
ALISTAIR DARLING HAS RULED OUT ANY 
IMMEDIATE O'CONNOR SESSIONS ON THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX BAND HE 
TOLD THE B. B. C. IT WAS SOMEBODY HE 
COULD RETURN TO NO U. TURN AND NO 
CLIMBDOWN AT LEAST NOT YET THAT 
WAS THE GOVERNMENT 
TAX PLANS ALISTAIR DARLING 
DELIVERED TO ANNOUNCE ON TELEVISION 
THIS MORNING SOME OF THE POOREST 
VOTERS COULD BE LEFT POORER MANY 
LABOUR M. P.'S ARE ANXIOUS THAT WILL BE 
THE REAL IMPACT OF THE DECISION TO 
SCRAP THE TEN P. TAX RATE THE 
CHANCELLOR DROPPED A HEAVY HINT 
THERE MIGHT BE HELP FOR THEM AT A 
LATER DATE HE SAID HE COULD NOT DO 
ANYTHING NOW 
I INTEND AS I SAY IN 
FUTURE BUDGETS TO DO MORE WHAT I 
CANNOT DO IS REWRITE THE BUDGET 
THE FINANCIAL YEAR HAS ALREADY 
BEGUN THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
WHO ARE ALREADY GOING TO BE PAYING 
TAX AT TWENTY P. RATHER THAN AT TWENTY TWO P. THAT THAT MEANS NO CHANGE IN TIME FOR THE 
DEBATE ON THIS IN THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS WHEN THE CONSERVATIVES AND 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL SIDE 
WITH LABOUR REBELS 
WE SHOULD 
REOPEN THE PACKAGE WHICH WAS 
PRESENTED AT LAST YEAR'S BUDGET 
WHICH WE COMPLAINED ABOUT AS A TAX 
CON AND LOOK HOW WE CAN HELP THE 
FIVE POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES 
WHO WILL SEE THEIR TAX GO UP WHAT WHAT THE LABOUR BACKBENCHERS SEE IS THE 
WAY THIS HAS BEEN FINANCED IS 
TAKING IT AWAY FROM PEOPLE AT THE 
BOTTOM THERE ARE CERTAIN GROUPS OF 
PEOPLE PARTICULARLY SINGLE 
YOUNGER WORKERS WHO DON'T HAVE 
ACCESS TO THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM WHO 
WILL BE ABSOLUTELY WORSE OFF THIS THIS IS A KEY POLITICAL FIGHT WITH 
MINISTERS EVERY BIT AS WORRY ABOUT 
THE DAMAGE FROM THEIR OWN M. P.'S AS 
FROM THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION 
POLICE INVESTIGATING AN ALLEGED 
PROSTITUTION RING WHICH USED THE 
INTERNET TO ATTRACT CLIENTS HAS 
CARRIED OUT TWENTY RAIDS IN LONDON TWELVE 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED 
ACROSS LONDON SEX TRAFFICKERS ARE 
AT WORK THEY ARE FORCING WOMEN 
INTO PROSTITUTION SO VICE SQUAD 
OFFICERS HAVE BEGUN OPERATION GIB 
AIMED AT ENDING EXPLOITATION BY 
SMASHING A SUSPECTED NETWORK OF 
CRIMINALS USING THE INTERNET TO RUN 
BOTH THEMS THE RAIDS ARE THE 
CONCLUSIONS OF SEVERAL MONTHS OF A 
COVERT OPERATION INTO A THAI GANG 
POLICE SAY USING THE INTERNET TO 
SELL SEX IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE 
COMMON CLIENTS BOOK WHAT THEY WANT 
FROM A MENU OF SERVICES SHOWN ON A 
WEBSITE THEY ARE TOLD WHERE AND 
WHEN TO MEET THE SEX WORKER SOME 
WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED INTO THE 
TRADE TO PAY OFF MASSIVE DEBTS 
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IS NOT AN UNCOMMON AMOUNT 
THIS IS BIG OPERATION IN TERMS OF 
THE NUMBERS WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS 
AN INCREASING USE OF THE INTERNET 
WEBSITES AS A MEANS OF USE OF THOSE ARRESTED WILL BE 
QUESTIONED IN CONNECTION WITH 
TRAFFICING TO THE U. K. THE WOMEN 
WILL BE TREATED AS VULNERABLE 
VICTIMS AND TAKEN TO A SAFE 
LOCATION OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL 
FORMER DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER JOHN 
PRESCOTT HAS ADMITTED HE SUFFERED 
FROM BULIMIA HE SAID HE USED TO 
OVEREAT DUE TO STRESS JOE CALZAGHE 
HAS WON HIS LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT MATCH 
AGAINST BERNARD HOPKINS IN LAS 
VEGAS HE WAS KNOCKED DOWN IN THE 
FIRST ROUND BUT WON ON THE 
NARROWIEST OF SPLIT DECISIONS THAT 
IS ALL THE NEWS FOR NOW MORE HERE 
ON B. B. C. ONE AT SIX OH FIVE P. M. IF YOU THINK 
THE RACE TO BE THE NEXT MAYOR OF 
LONDON ONLY AFFECTS LONDONERS 
THINK AGAIN IT IS THE MOST 
POWERFUL ELECTED POSITION IN THE U. K. 
WHERE IT LEADS THE REST OF THE 
COUNTRY TEPBLDZ TO FOLLOW THERE IS 
A POLICE FORCE AT THE FOREFRONT OF 
TERROR A FINANCIAL SECRETARY OR IN 
THREAT OF MELTDOWN THE RACE IS 
GOING DOWN TO THE WIRE IT IS NECK 
TO NECK IN THE POLLS WHO IS FIT TO 
RUN LONDON AND THE LIVES OF 
MILLIONS WHO LIVE IN THE CAPITAL 
BEFORE WE CAME ON AIR THE THREE 
CANDIDATES JOINED ME IN THE STUDIO 
ON THIS FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
RIVERS OF BLOOD SPEECH IMMIGRATION 
SEEMED A RIGHT PLACE TO START 
LONDON IS THE MOST DIVERSE CITY IN 
THE WORLD DO YOU THINK THERE HAS 
BEEN TOO MUCH IMMIGRATION INTO THIS 
CITY IN RECENT YEARS THE THE PREDICTIONS OF RIERS OF BLOOD HAVE 
FAILED TO COME TRUE IN LONDON WHAT 
A MAGNIFICENT EXAMPLE OF DIVERSE IT 
ISTY AND KOSMA MOLLI TAN THERE IS 
I THINK THE GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO 
COUNT PROPERLY AND TO FUND LONDON 
BOROUGHS PROPERLY MEAN THERE ARE 
LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN LONDON 
THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE 
AND DOES NOT GIVE LONDON BOROUGHS 
SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR 
HAS THERE 
BEEN TOO MUCH IMMIGRATION IN RECENT 
YEARS 
THERE HAS BEEN UNFUNDED YEARS IMMIGRATION THAT PRECENTS PROBLEMS 
FOR LONDON BOROUGHS WHO HAVE TO 
PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES 
AND ARE NOT GETTING FUNDING FROM 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS A BIG 
ISSUE ON WHICH THE LONDON MAYOR 
SHOULD SPEAK OUT AND HAS NOT SPOKEN 
OUT 
YOUR OLD FRIEND TREVOR OUT PHILLIPS SAYS THIS MORNING THAT 
LACK OF CONTROL HAS LED TO A RACIAL 
COLD WAR BETWEEN DIFFERENT GROUPS 
WELL NOT HERE IN LONDON IF YOU 
ACTUALLY LOOK RACIAL INCIDENTS IN 
LONDON ANTI SEMITIC INCIDENTS ARE 
DOWN BY HALF OVER THE PAST EIGHT 
YEARS LAST YEAR THEY DROPPED FOURTEEN PER CENT 
IN LONDON THEY WENT UP TWELVE PER CENT OUTSIDE 
FAITH LEADERS POLITICIANS HAVE 
GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE THE 
CASE FOR TOLERANCE AND MUTUAL 
RESPECT IT HAS WORKED 
SIXTY PER CENT OF 
PEOPLE IN A B. B. C. POLL SAID THERE HAD 
BEEN TOO MUCH IMMIGRATION GOING ON 
HALF OF ALL THE IMMIGRANTS WHO COME 
TO BRITAIN COME TO LONDON FROM 
WHEREVER IN THE WORLD LONDON IS 
THE ONLY PLACE IN EUROPE WHICH 
MATCHES AMERICAN LEVELS OF 
COMPETITIVENESS THERE IS IS LOT 
OF DYNAMISM IN LONDON THE REASON 
SO MANY FIRMS COME HERE TO DO 
BUSINESS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE HOST 
COMMUNITIES HERE THEY FEEL AT HOME 
BRIAN PADDICK DO YOU THINK THE 
UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION THAT BORIS 
JOHNSON TALKED ABOUT THERE HAS 
PLACED A BIG STRAIN ON PUBLIC 
SERVICES IN THE CAPITAL 
IT HAS 
THE WAY THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT FAILS 
TO COMPENSATE LOCAL AUTHORITIES OR 
AT LEAST THERE IS AN ENORMOUS TIME 
LAG BETWEEN THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
SUBMITTING FIGURES AND GETTING THE 
FUNDING TO COPE IS CREATING REAL 
ISSUES I THINK IMMIGRANTS 
CONTRIBUTE AN EENORMOUS AMOUNT TO 
THE WEALTH OF LONDON BUT LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO 
PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THESE NEW 
IMMIGRANTS 
LET'S CONSIDER NOW THE IMMIGRANTS WHOLE QUESTION OF DIVERSE IT ISTY 
OF THE CITY A CITY IN WHICH 
SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MUSLIMS LIVE HOW EQUIPPED 
ARE YOU TO LEAD THIS CITY WHEN YOU 
HAVE SAID THAT ISLAM IS THE MOST 
VICIOUS SECTARIAN OF ALL 
RELIGIONS 
WELL I THINK JON IF RELIGIONS YOU LOOK AT THE QUOTATION YOU HAVE 
TAKEN IT IS WRENCHED OUT OF CONTEXT 
I BELIEVE IT IS A RELIGION OF PEACE 
WHEN YOU ASK HOW WELL EQUIPPED AM I 
TO LEAD A CITY IN WHICH THERE ARE 
SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MUSLIMS IT IS ALMOST A 
CENTURY AGO THAT MY MUSLIM GREAT 
GRANDFATHER CAME TO THIS CITY AND 
HIS SON GOT STUCK INTO THE LIFE OF 
THIS COUNTRY IN THE WAY THAT I WANT 
IMMIGRANTS WHO COME TO LONDON TO DO 
YOU SAID I HAVE WRENCHED THE QUOTE 
OUT OF CONTEXT LET ME GIVE YOU THE 
WHOLE QUOTE THEN LET PEOPLE JUDGE 
ON IT YOU WROTE THIS IN THE WAKE 
OF THE SEVEN TO SEVEN BOMBING WHEN YOU WERE 
M. P. AND EDITOR OF THE SPECTATOR YOU 
SAID IT MEANS DISPOSING OF THE 
FIRST TABOO AND ACCEPTING THE 
PROBLEM IS ISLAM ISLAM IS THE 
PROBLEM TO ANY NON MUSLIM READER 
OF THE CORE RON ISLAMOPHOBIA SEEMS 
A NATURAL REACTION AND WHAT THE 
TEXT IS TO PROVOKE JUDGED ON ITS 
SCRIPTURE TO SAY NOTHING OF WHICH 
IS PREACHED IN THE MOSQUES IT IS 
THE MOST VICIOUSLY SECTARIAN OF ALL 
RELIGIONS IN ITS HEARTLESSNESS IT IT IS TRUE IF YOU LOOK AT THE TEXTS OF 
THE KORAN IT IS POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE 
OF EXTREMIST INTENTIONS AND PEOPLE 
WHO WANT TO INSPIRE EVIL IN MEN'S 
HEARTS TO WRENCH THEM OUT OF 
CONTEXT AND PROVOKE THEM TO EVIL 
ACTS ANYBODY WHO HAS SEEN WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED IN THE WORLD OVER THE LAST 
FEW YEARS WOULD BE AT PAINS TO DENY 
THAT THAT IS ALL I WAS SAYING L. 
PASSIONATELY BELIEVE ISLAM IS A 
RELIGION OF PEACE AND THE MUSLIM 
COMMUNITY DESERVE PROTECTION AND 
SUPPORT LIKE EVERY OTHER COMMUNITY 
IN THIS CITY THEY DESERVE TO HAVE 
THEIR STREETS AND BUSES SAFER ALL 
THE PUBLIC SPACES WHICH THE MAYOR 
IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE MADE BY 
THE NEXT MAYOR 
DO YOU TAKE BACK 
WHAT YOU SAID THAT ISLAM IS THE 
PROBLEM LESS THAN THREE YEARS AGO 
OF COURSE I AM NOT SAYING ISLAM IS 
ITSELF THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS 
PEOPLE WHO WRENCH OUT OF CONTEXT 
QUOTES FROM ISLAM THE KORAN AND 
USE IT TO INSPIRE EVIL IN MEN'S 
HEARTS THAT IS FACT THAT FEW 
SERIOUS PEOPLE WOULD DENY WE NEED 
TO TACKLE THE EXTREMISMS WHAT WE 
MUST NOT DO IS INVITE PEOPLE WHO 
PRAECH HATRED AND DIVISION WHAT WE 
SHOULD BE DOING IS REACHING OUT TO 
ISLAMIC MODERATES PEOPLE OF 
GOODWILL AND TRYING TO BEAT DOWN 
THE EXTREMES OF THOSE WHO PROMOTE 
DIVISION 
IS ISLAM A PROBLEM L. DIVISION I DON'T THINK SO AT ALL THERE IS 
GROUP AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE TO 
TALK ABOUT A CLASH OF CIVILISATIONS 
I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 
THE AMERICAN ARMS INDUSTRY HAVING 
SEEN THE END OF THE COLD WAR THEY 
ARE HAPPY TO HAVE ENDLESS CONFLICT 
LOOK AT LONDON WE HAVE OVER HALF A 
MILLION MUSLIMS THEY LIVE SIDE BY 
SIDE WITH CHRISTIANS AND JEWS YOU 
HAVE EVERY NATIONALITY EVERY RACE 
IT WORKS PERFECTLY HERE 
YOU DON'T 
THINK IT IS THE MOST VICIOUSLY 
VICIOUS OF ALL ALL RELIGIONS YOU YOU WILL LOOK AT RELIGIOUS BOOKS THE 
FACT IS WHAT ARE THE PREACHERS 
SAYING TODAY BE YOU GO INTO A 
CHURCH HINDU MOSQUE OR SYNAGOGUE 
ALL OUR FAITH LEADERS MAKE A CASE 
FOR COMMUNICATING 
HOW DID IT HELP 
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT 
COMMUNITYS TO INVITE OR SHARE A 
PLATFORM WITH A LICK HE HE DENOUNCED THE AL QAEDA HE IS 
STRONG ENEMY OF AL QAEDA 
HOW COME 
HE SUPPORTED SUICIDE BOMBINGS WE WE DID NOT AGREE ON A LOT OF THINGS 
THE ISSUE IS ARE WE GOING TO 
SUPPORT THOSE PEOPLE IN THE MUSLIM 
WORLD WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO AL QAEDA 
AND TERRORISM OR ARE WE GOING TO 
SAY WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH 
ANYONE UNLESS WE AGREE ON 
EVERYTHING 
HOW DOES AL QARADAWI DO EVERYTHING THIS BY CALLING FOR HOMOSEXUALS TO 
BE THROWN OFF CLIFFS 
I I MADE IT I CLEAR YOU MUST NOT ATTRACT 
HOMOSEXUALS STRIKE YOUR WIFE L. 
HEARD HIM SAY IT WITH MY OWN EARS 
YOU KEPT SAYING HE SAYS YOU SHOULD 
OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND IF THE 
LAW OF THE LAND IS YOU ARE ALLOWED 
TO MURDER HOMOSEXUALS ALLOWED TO 
BEAT YOUR WIFE ALLOWED TO CARRY 
OUT SUICIDE BOMBINGS HE IS SAYING 
IT IS ACCEPTABLE IN THOSE COUNTRIES 
IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN ANY 
COUNTRIES WHAT I SAID IN THE 
AFTERMATH OF SEVEN SEVENTHS IS THE TERM 
ISLAMISM TERRORISM IS A 
CONTRADICTION IN TERMS THERE IS 
NOTHING IN THE KORAN TO JUSTIFY THE 
MURDER OF FIFTY TWO INNOCENT PEOPLE ON ON AL QARADAWI ON FEMALE P. IF THIS 
APPROACH FAILS IT IS PERMISSIBLE 
FOR THE HUSBAND TO BEAT HIS WIFE 
AVOIDING HER FACE AND OTHER 
SENSITIVE PARTS ON THE DEATH 
PENALTY ON USING CHILDREN ON 
SUICIDE BOMBINGS HE IS HARDLY 
PROMOTING RACIAL TOLERANCE 
YOU NEED TO LET ME ANSWER THE 
QUESTION HE IS AN OPPONENT OF AL 
QAEDA 
HE IS A SUPPORTER OF SUICIDE QAEDA BOMBING CHILD SUICIDE BOMBINGS HE HE IS INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING THE 
PALESTINIANS BOTH SIDES IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST HAVE DONE TERRIBLE 
THINGS I CONDEMN ALL ACTS OF 
VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST YOU 
CANNOT JUST BE SELECTIVE ABOUT THIS 
HERE IS A MAN PREPARED TO SAY AL 
QAEDA IS WRONG AND TO BE VERY 
STRONG IN THAT CONDEMNATION IF WE 
WILL NOT ENGAGE WITH HIM YOU WILL 
BE 
DON'T YOU THINK THERE IS 
ENOUGH HATRED AND DIVISION WITHOUT 
IMPORTS IT FROM ABROAD 
I HAD TO 
TALK TO THE LEADERS OF THE I. R. A. AT 
THE HEIGHT OF THE BOMBING CAMPAIGN 
I BELIEVED IF WE STARTED A DIALOGUE 
IT COULD BRING AN END TO WAR L. WAS 
TEN AYEARS AHEAD OF MY TEN YEARS 
AHEAD OF MY TIME 
I HAVE NEVER HEARD HIM SAY THAT I 
HAVE HEARD HIM SAY AS HE SAID IN 
BRITAIN AS HE SAID ON NEWSNIGHT 
ISN'T THAT NAIVE THESE QUOTES ARE 
OUT THERE ONE CHILDREN IN SUICIDE 
BOMBINGS WE CANNOT SAY THE 
CASUALTIES IN ISRAELI SUICIDE 
BOMBINGS WERE INNOCENT CIVILIANS 
THEY WERE NOT CIVILIANS OR INNOCENT 
WHY DO YOU INVITE HIM TO SHARE 
PLATFORM WITH YOU 
HE CAME TO 
LONDON TO OPPOSED THE FRENCH 
GOVERNMENT BANNING YOUNG MUSLIM 
WOMEN FROM WEARING THEIR HE JUG HE HE HAD NO REGRETS ABOUT HIM SHARING 
A PLATFORM WITH HIM 
HE HAVE TO 
ENGAGE WITH MUSLIMS HE REPRESENTS 
THE BIGGEST STRAND OF PROGRESSIVE 
MUSLIM OPINION IN LONDON HE IS 
ATTACKED BY THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY 
THERE ARE OTHER MODERATE MUSLIMS 
YOU COULD ENGAGE IN WHO DO NOT HAVE 
THOSE EXTREME VIEWS YOU EMBRACED 
THIS MAN ON A PLATFORM IN CITY HALL 
I MANAGED TO MEET ALL THOSE MUSLIMS 
THEY REPRESENT TENS OF THOUSANDS 
HE REPRESENTS A MILLIONS HE IS 
TALKING ABOUT ENGAGING WITH THE 
WEST WEST I WANT TO TALK ABOUT POLICING 
BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE GREAT 
ROLES OF THE MAYOR BRIAN PADDICK 
SHOULD SIR IAN BLAIR STAY ON AS 
COMMISSIONER 
THE MUCH POLLEN AND COMMISSIONER POLICE AUTHORITY HAS LOOKED AT 
EVERYTHING AROUND STOCKWELL AND SIR 
IAN BLAIR'S ROLE IN THAT THEY HAVE 
DECIDED HE SHOULD REMAIN AS IN HIS 
POST THE COMMISSIONER AND THE MET 
NEED TO WORK PROGRESSIVELY TO MAKE 
LONDON SAFER LET'S PUT THE PAST 
BEHIND US AND MOVE ON 
YOU HAVE 
MADE POLICING ONE OF YOUR CENTRAL 
APPEALS AS A LONG EXPERIENCED 
POLICEMEN ON THE STREETS OF LONDON 
ISN'T THAT YOUR GREATEST WEAKNESS 
YOU HAVE BOUGHT FALLEN OUT SO 
BADLY WITH SIR IAN BLAIR YOU'LL 
HAVE TO WORK HAND IN GLOVE WITH THE 
PERSON WHO EFFECTIVELY BROUGHT AN 
END TO YOUR CAREER 
THERE WAS THE 
ISSUE THE SHOOTING AT STOCKWELL 
BAT AT IAN BLAIR AND I FELL OUT OF 
ON OTHER NINETY NINE PER CENT OF ISSUES WE HAVE A 
LOT OF COMMON GROUND WE BOTH 
BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE A MORE 
REPRESENTATIVE POLICE SERVICE YOUR YOUR AUTOBIOGRAPHY CHARTS THE BREAKDOWN 
OF THAT RELATIONSHIP YOU ARE 
ASKING US TO BELIEVE YOU WILL BE 
ABLE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH HIM I I MET WITH HIM JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS 
THE CHRISTMAS JUST GONE AFTER I 
HAD SAID WHAT I HAD SAID ABOUT 
STOCKWELL AND AFTER I LEFT THE 
POLICE AFTER TWENTY FIVE MINUTES OF THE 
MEETING HE DISMISSED HIS NOTE 
TAKER SUCH WAS THE TRUST BETWEEN 
US 
AND MAYBE IT WAS BEST FOR THE US NOTE TAKER TO GO 
YOU CAN ASK HIM 
HOW WE GOT ON IN THAT MEETING I 
BELIEVE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER THE THE IMPORTANT THING TO DO ON 
SECOND IS 
A WORK CLOSELY WITH THE 
COMMISSIONER AS I WILL GET MORE 
POLICE ON THE BEAT THERE ARE EIGHT THOUSAND 
POLICE IN CAMDEN ONLY EIGHTY ARE ON 
THE STREETS AT ONE TIME WE NEED A 
MAYOR WHO WILL SPEAK UP AGAINST THE 
BUREAUCRACY AND THE FORM FILLING 
THAT A PRESS AS THE POLICE ACROSS 
LONDON AND CAMPAIGNS TO GET ANTI 
BUREAUCRACY WRITTEN INTO THE MATCH 
POLLAND POLICE AUTHORITY AGENDA 
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED IT NEEDS TO 
HAPPEN FROM 
SECOND AFTER THIRTY YEARS 
AFTER THIRTY YEARS L. L. WAS THE FIRST POLITICIAN TO GET 
REGULAR BEAT PATROLS ON THE STREETS 
OF LONDON THAT IS WHY CRIME FELL 
SIX PER CENT LAST YEAR AND SIX PER CENT THE YEAR 
BEFORE IDENTIFYING THE KIDS WHO 
GET IN TROUBLE MURDER DOWN BY TWENTY EIGHT 
PER CENT KNIFE CRIME DOWN BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT WE 
ALL KNEW WHEN THE HOME OFFICE AND 
THE CHIEF CONSTABLE SAID BEAT 
POLICING DOES NOT WORK WE KNEW IT 
ISN'T TRUE 
THEN THERE IS UNDER 
ARREST AND RAISING FEARS ACROSS 
LONDON MUGGING IS UP VIOLENT 
CRIME IS UP IN ALL OUR LONDON 
SUBURBS PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THEY ARE 
GETTING A GOOD DEAL THEY NEED A 
MAYOR WHO WILL SPEAK UP FOR THEM A A I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT ANOTHER 
FEAR PROBABLY AN AWFUL LOT OF 
LONDONERS AND PEOPLE AROUND THE 
COUNTRY WATCHING HAVE AND THAT IS 
THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY KEN THE 
INSTANT IT IS THE FEAR ABOUT THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PER CENT TAX RATE 
ISN'T THERE A DANGER THIS COULD BE 
GORDON BROWN'S POLL TAX MOMENT IT IT IS A MISTAKE TO ABOLISH THE TEN PER CENT 
RATE I AM NOT HERE TO PUT THE 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT'S CASE 
YOU ARE 
WHEN I CAME BACK INTO THE LABOUR 
PARTY I AM ANSWERABLE TO THE 
PEOPLE OF LONDON CAN SAY WHAT I 
BELIEVE I AM NOT A SPOKESPERSON 
FOR THE GOVERNMENT THINK THE TEN 
PER CENT TAX IS WRONG AND WE WILL DO MORE 
FOR THE POOREST PEOPLE THE ONES 
PAYING TOO MUCH TAX 
SO GORDON 
BROWN HAS GOT THIS WRONG 
WE HAVE 
GOT IT WRONG OVER THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS 
I THINK PEOPLE LIKE BORIS AND MAY 
SHOULD BE PAYING MORE TAX AND THE 
POOREST PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE PAYING 
ANY 
YOU SHOULD STOP RAISING THE ANY MERYL PRECEPT BY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO PER CENT SINCE HE 
CAME IN 
IT HAS ALL GONE ON 
POLICING 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS HAVE POLICING BEEN WASTED ON HIS WATCH 
I WANT TO 
COME BACK TO THIS WHOLE IDEA OF THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
HOW WORRIED ARE YOU THIS IS GOING 
TO COSTUME REAL VOTES YOU ARE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE LABOUR CANDIDATE FOR 
MAYOR 
WHAT IS DISTINCTIVE WHEN YOU MAYOR LOOK AT THE POLLS IS THAT IT BEARS 
NO RELATION TO THE NATIONAL 
STANDING THERE ARE POLLS SAYING ME 
AND BORIS ARE NECK AND NECK NOBODY 
RUNS M. A. I. BORIS AND NOBODY RUNS YOU 
THAT IS WHAT LONDONERS LIKE KEN KEN LIVINGSTONE JUST ON THAT THAT 
SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE SAYING IF I 
WAS RUNNING AS A LABOUR CANDIDATE 
I WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE BECAUSE 
THE GOVERNMENT IS SO UNPOPULAR THE THE REALITIES IN THE CITY PEOPLE JUDGE 
YOU ON WHAT YOU HAVE DONE PEOPLE 
JUDGE BORIS ON WHAT HE HAS WRITTEN 
THIS IS A TIGHT RACE THIS IS MID 
TERM AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT 
GOING WELL L. AM CONFIDENT IF IT 
GETS IT RIGHT LOOKING AFTER A 
LOWER INCOME FAMILIES IT CAN WIN A 
FOURTH TERM 
IN THIS CITY PER CENT OF 
CHILDREN ARE LIVING IN POVERTY 
AFTER ELEVEN YEARS OF A LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT AND EIGHT YEARS OF A 
LABOUR MAYOR IS THAT A RECORD YOU 
ARE PROUD OF 
THAT IS WHY I WAS THE 
MAYOR WHO ABOLISHED FARES ON THE 
BUSES FOR UNDER EIGHTEEN WHICH SAVES THE 
AVERAGE FAMILY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY A YEAR 
A BORIS 
JOHNSON I WANT TO ASK YOU YOU 
WANT TO TAX THE SO CALLED NONE THE 
MESSIAH RESIDENTS HOW WILL THAT 
HELP THE CITY AT A TIME OF GREAT 
FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY WHEN PEOPLE 
ARE SAYING WE CAN MOVE OUR 
HEADQUARTERS TO ANOTHER COUNTRY 
QUITE QUICKLY 
I AM OPPOSED TO THE 
LABOUR PARTY'S PROPOSAL WHICH IS A 
THIRTY THOUSAND CHARGE WHICH THEY HAVEN'T 
BOTHERED TO ESTABLISH IN ADVANCE IS 
CREDIBLE TO THE I R. S. OBLIGATIONS 
OF NORTH AMERICAN TAXPAYERS L. 
THINK THEY SHOULD BE DRUMMED OFF 
OUT OF OFFICE FOR THAT SINGLE ACT 
OF INCOMPETENCE ALONE GEORGE 
OSBORNE HAS PROPOSED STEPS WE HAVE 
STRUCTURED IT SO IT IS DISPENSABLE 
DISCOUNTER BALL AGAINST A EURO 
AMERICAN TAXATION THE LABOUR MAYOR 
IS PRETENDING HE IS NOT A CREATURE 
OF THE LABOUR PARTY HE IS FUNDED 
BY THE LABOUR PARTY AND WITHOUT 
GIVING AWAY THE DONORS HE SHOULD 
BE MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THAT DO DO YOU FEEL THE UNDERDOG IN THIS 
MAYORAL ELECTION 
WE HAVE HAD FIVE 
OR SIX POLLS IN THIS ELECTION WHICH 
HAVE SHOWN JUST A FEW POINTS 
BETWEEN MYSELF AND BORIS THIS IS 
THE MOST DIFFICULT ELECTION I HAVE 
EVER FACED THE MAYOR WE ELECT ON 
MAY FIRST HAS TO BUILD FIFTY THOUSAND 
AFFORDABLE HOMES IN THREE YEARS 
UNLEASHED A THIRTY NINE BILLION TRANSPORT 
INVESTMENT PROGRAMME AND TAKE 
CONTROL OF SKILLS AND TRAINING IN 
LONDON THEY THINK SOMEBODY WHO HAS 
HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF RUNNING 
THINGS RATHER THAN A SMALL RIGHT 
WING MAGAZINE 
HE HAS TO DO ALL 
THOSE THINGS MAKE THE STREETS AND 
TRANSPORT SAFER AFTER A TEARS OF A 
LABOUR MAYOR IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT 
IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF THIS 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN YOU HAVE DECIDED 
HE WILL CHANGE THE RULE TO CHANGE 
BAN ALCOHOL ON THE TUBE 
PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO LISTEN IF 
YOU ARE SPEAKING AT ONCE THE THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT WANT TO MAKE IT A 
MANDATORY PRISON SENTENCE FOR 
ANYBODY CARRYING A GUN YOU VOTED 
AGAINST THAT 
YOU ARE LETTING OUT A 
LOT OF PRISONERS EARLY AND THAT IS 
THE PROBLEM 
MY EXPERIENCE OF 
TALKING TO PEOPLE ON THE STREET IS 
PEOPLE ARE VERY VERY NERVOUS ABOUT 
VOTING FOR BORIS JOHNSON EVEN 
THOUGH THEY ARE CONSERVATIVES 
BECAUSE HE HAS NO EXPERIENCE 
RUNNING ANYTHING THEY ARE NERVOUS 
ABOUT KEN LIVINGSTONE BECAUSE OF 
HIS RECORD OVER THE LAST EIGHT 
YEARS THERE IS A SERIOUS 
ALTERNATIVE SOMEBODY WHO IS 
TALKING SENSE WHO DO NOT BEHAVE 
LIKE CHILDREN IN A PLAYGROUND LIKE 
THESE TWO DO THE REAL OPPORTUNITY 
TO WIN OVER UNDECIDED VOTERS AND 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE FED UP WITH 
CAREER POLITICIANS 
BRIAN PADDICK 
IF KEN LIVINGSTONE IS THE UNDERDOG 
AREN'T YOU THAT THEIR DOG IN THIS 
CAMPAIGN YOU HAVE HAD AN EQUAL 
PLATFORM WITH THESE OTHER TWO YET 
YOU ARE WAY BEHIND 
THE POLES ARE 
VARIED AND THEY VARY BETWEEN TEN PER CENT 
UP TO FOURTEEN PER CENT THE FACT IS THERE WERE 
SIXTEEN PER CENT UNDECIDED VOTERS LOT OF 
PEOPLE WHO DON'T NORMALLY VOTE IN 
AN ELECTION WHO ARE LOOKING TO VOTE 
FOR ME BECAUSE I AM NOT A CAREER 
POLITICIAN I SPEAK THE TRUTH HAVE HAVE YOU DECIDED WAY YOU SECOND 
PREFERENCE IS GOING IN THIS 
ELECTION THAT COULD BE CRITICAL ON 
MAY FIRST 
I HAVE DECIDED WHAT MY OWN 
PERSONAL VIEW IS IT IS A SECRET 
BALLOT 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PARTY BALLOT THAT ADVOCATES THIS FORM OF 
PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WHY 
CAN'T YOU TELL US 
MY JOB AS A 
CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR IS TO GET 
PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR ME FIRST 
PREFERENCE MY RESPONSIBILITY AS A 
DEMOCRAT IS TO SAY TO PEOPLE YOU 
HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE OTHER 
CANDIDATES AND MAKE YOUR OWN MIND 
UP TO VOTE FOR SECOND PREFERENCE 
WHO IS THE WORST OUT OF THESE TWO 
YOU ARE BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD 
PLACE 
COME OFF THE FENCE WHO IS PLACE YOUR SECOND PREFERENCE 
IT IS NOT 
THESE TWO AND I AM NOT PREPARED TO 
SAY ANY MORE 
BORIS JOHNSON YOU 
ARE A FABULOUS COLUMNIST BUT ISN'T 
THAT WHAT MAKES YOU UNFIT TO BE 
MAYOR YOU DO SPEAK YOUR MIND YOU 
WENT ON THE ASIAN NETWORK THIS WEEK 
AND SAID I AM DOWN WITH THE 
ETHNICS YOU CANNOT OUT ETHNIC ME

YOU SAID YOU'RE SAT NEXT TO AN 
ASIAN TELEVISION REPORT

A POSE LIKE MANY PEOPLE IN THE CITY 
FROM IMMIGRANTS FROM ALL OVER THE 
WORLD PEOPLE WANT A CLEAR CHOICE 
AND A CHANGE ON MAY FIRST FROM AN 
ERA WHICH IS STALE AND RUNNING OUT 
OF FRESH IDEAS THEY WANT SOMEONE 
WHO CAN OFFER NEW THINKING 
PARTICULARLY ADDRESSING THEIR NO ONE 
CONCERN WHICH IS THEIR FEELING OF 
INSECURITY IN PUBLIC SPACE 
PARTICULARLY THE SPACES THE MAYOR 
IS RESPONSIBLE THE BUSES THE 
STATION PLATFORM 
WHAT ARE THEY 
DON'T WANT HIS INCOMPETENCE 
SOMEBODY WHO LIKES TO MAKE JOKES AT 
OTHER PEOPLE'S EXPENSE THEY DON'T 
WANT DIVISION AND HOSTILITY BEING 
GENERATED THROUGH ILL THOUGHT 
THROUGH COMMENTS THIS IS WHAT YOU 
GET 
UP WHAT THEY WANT IS SOMEONE GET WHO HAVE LIVED HALF OF THEIR LIVE 
SOUTH OF THE RIVER HALF OF THEIR 
LIFE NORTH OF THE RIVER THAT IS 
ALMOST LIKE BEING MIXED RACE BORIS 
WE HAVE THIRTY SECONDS IF YOU WERE TO 
USE ONE WORD TO DESCRIBE THE OTHER 
TWO CAN DO THAT WHAT WOULD THEY 
BE 
WHY JUST ONE WORD CAN'T WE BE HAVE TWO OR THREE 
STALE AND GOT 
SOME INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY 
ABOUT POLICING

THERE ARE TEN CANDIDATES 
RUNNING TO BE MAYOR OF LONDON HERE 
THEY ALL ARE AND YOU CAN READ MORE 
ABOUT EACH ONE OF THEM ON THE 
POLITICS SHOW WEBSITE 
DOES ROCK AGAINST RACISM CHANGE THE 
WAY PEOPLE THINK BUT FIRST THE 
POLITICS SHOW WHERE YOU ARE 
EXCUSE US IF WE STICK WITH THE 
MAYORAL CONTEST WE CANNOT GET 
ENOUGH OF IT IN RECENT DAYS SOME 
COMMENTATORS HAVE SAID IT IS LACK 
LUSTER FAILING TO CATCH FIRE ONE 
EXPLANATION FOR THAT IS WE THINK 
THEY MAY FEEL THEY HAVE BEEN 
CHEATED WASN'T BORIS JOHNSON GOING 
TO BE MORE FUN NOT ACCORDING TO 
THE POLLS ONE POLL SUGGESTS HE IS 
NECK TO NECK WITH KEN LIVINGSTONE 
HE HAS BEEN RECONDITIONED AS MR. 
SERIOUS IS IT ENOUGH TO REMOVE 
THE GIANT NEWT FROM HIS LAY YA 
WE LOOK AT WHAT HE IS OFFERING 
GOOD EVENINGMENT WELCOME TO HAVE I 
GOT NEWS FOR YOU MY BORIS BORIS JOHNSON IS NOT AN ORDINARY 
POLITICIAN HE FIRST CAME TO PUBLIC 
ATTENTION ON GAMESHOWS IT WAS AT 
THE EDITOR OF THE SPECTATOR THAT HE 
HIT HEADLINES BEING FORCED TO 
APOLOGISE FOR SAYING LIVERPUDLIANS 
WERE WALLOWING IN SELF PITY OVER 
KEN BIGLEY 
BORIS WAS LESS THAN 
FRANK HE COULD NOT BE SUSTAINED 
IN THE END MICHAEL WHEN HE 
REALISED BORIS HAD BEEN FRANK WITH 
HIM HAD TO ASK HIM TO GO 
SINCE BECOMING THE CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY'S OFFICIAL CANDIDATE FOR 
MAYOR HE HAS UNDERGONE A REMARKABLE 
TRANSFORMATION FROM SHAGY HAIRED TO 
WELL GROOMED CANDIDATES RECENT 
CLAIMS SAID IT IS A CLOSE RUN THING 
WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD LONDONER'S 
REALLY NOTICE 
IT IS CLEAR THE 
JOHNSON TEAM HAVE DECIDED AS FAR AS 
POSSIBLE THEY SHOULD HUG THE 
LIVINGSTONE RECORD THEY DON'T WANT 
TO SUGGEST THERE IS GOING TO BE A 
RADICAL CHANGE 
BORIS JOHNSON HAS PUT CRIME AT THE 
FOCUS OF HIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGING TO 
REDUCE IT ON BUSES BY MAKING 
TEENAGE TEAR AWAYS WIN BACK THEIR 
RIGHT TO FREE SERVICE BY COMMUNITY 
INVESTING IN YOUTH SERVICES YOU YOU CAN'T TREAT CANCER WITH AN ASPIRIN 
HIS APPROACH TO GANGS IN LONDON IS 
PRETTY WELL THAT WHERE HE SUGGESTS 
MORE SPORTS MORE ART I REALLY 
DON'T THINK THAT IS THE SOLUTION 
THE SOLUTION IS MUCH MORE 
COMPLICATED MUCH MORE DIFFICULT 
THAN THAT 
HE ALSO PLANS TO PUT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY EXTRA 
COMMUNITY SUPPORT OFFICERS ON 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
ANOTHER FLAGSHIP TRANSPORT POLICY 
IS TO REPLACE THE BENDY BUS WITH A 
NEW ROUTEMASTER THERE HAVE BEEN 
BIG DOUBTS ABOUT THE SUMS THIS 
WEEK HE USED FIGURE ON THE 
CAMPAIGN TRAIL THAT HE DIDN'T SHARE 
ON A T. V. DEBATE DAY LATER 
I STICK 
BY OUR FIGURE OF EIGHT MILLION AS THE 
COST 
ON THE CONGESTION CHARGE COST HE WANTS TO HOLD A CONSULTATION 
WITH LOCAL RESIDENTS ON WHETHER TO 
ROLL BACK ON THE WESTERN EXTENSION 
MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO PAY 
AND STOP THE PROPOSED TWENTY FIVE CHARGE 
FOR THE MOST POLLUTING VEHICLES 
THE COST WILL VARY ACCORDING TO THE 
TIME OF DAY 
I CAN NOT QUITE SEE 
WHAT BORIS JOHNSON IS DOING ABOUT 
THE CONGESTION CHARGE L. THINK HE 
IS REALLY FUDGING IT THERE HE IS 
BASICALLY SAYING I AM NOT GOING TO 
ABOLISH IT BUT DON'T KNOW WHAT TO 
DO ABOUT IT 
HE WANTS TO SEE 
GARDENS PROTECTED DESPITE OPPOSING 
THE KYOTO TREATY TO SIGN UP TO THE 
MAYOR'S CURRENT CARBON DIOXIDE 
EMISSIONS TARGETS 
IT IS AN 
INTERESTING MANIFESTO THE BIG AREA 
IS OF DOUBT IS WHETHER HE HAS 
CONVERTED TO CLIMATE CHANGE HE HAS 
ADOPTED THE MAYOR'S POLICIES IS HE 
DOING ANY MORE THAN THAT ON ON HOUSING THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE CURRENT MAYOR 
HE SAYS HE WILL SCRAP THE TARGET 
FIFTY PER CENT NEW HOMES TO BE AFFORDABLE A 
TARGET HE SAYS PUTS DEVELOPERS OFF 
BUILDING HOMES AT ALL HE PROMISES 
A LESS ANTAGONISTIC RELATIONSHIP 
WITH LOCAL COUNCILS THAN THE 
CURRENT MAYOR ENJOYS 
EVERYBODY IN 
LONDON AGREES WE NEED MORE HOUSING 
BUT THE INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS OF 
EACH OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITYS IS TO 
ASK FOR THE HOUSING TO BE DELIVERED 
SOMEWHERE ELSE THE MAYOR HAS TO BE 
ROBUST IN HIS DEALING LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES AUTHORITIES WITH SOME MAJOR SIMILARITIES 
BETWEEN BORIS JOHNSON AND KEN 
LIVINGSTONE'S POLICIES IS HE 
BANKING ON DESIRE FOR A CHANGE AT 
THE WHEEL BEHIND ME RATHER THAN A 
RADICAL CHANGE OF DIRECTION 
BORIS JOHNSON IS HERE WITH US AGAIN 
LET ME ASK YOU WHAT WOULD THE OLD 
BORIS JOHNSON THE COLUMNIST MAKE 
OF THIS NEW SERIOUSLY RESTRAINED 
BORIS JOHNSON 
THERE IS NO DIVISION 
BETWEEN THIS SO CALLED OLD AND NEW 
BORIS JOHNSON L. AM DEADLY SERIOUS 
ABOUT THE ISSUES WHICH REALLY 
MATTER TO LONDONERS YOUR PROGRAMME 
ASKED ABOUT WHAT ARE THE RADICAL 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ME AND THE 
CURRENT LABOUR MAYHEWOR HE DOES 
NOT TAKE PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCE OF 
CRIME SERIOUSLY ENOUGH THAT IS WHY 
I PUT EMPHASIS ON USING PUBLICITY 
BUDGETS AND PRESS OFFICER BUDGETS 
TO PUT MORE UNIFORMED PEOPLE ON 
BUSES 
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED IT IS BUSES NOT JUST OUR FILM A LOT OF PEOPLE 
HAVE SAID IT THE DAILY MAIL SAID 
THE NEW BORIS IS AN ACT ONE HE HAS 
NOT PERFECTED YET THE SUN TIMES 
BORIS HAS TWO WEEKS TO GET ON BEING 
HIMSELF OTHERWISE HE WILL LOSE THE 
DAILY TELEGRAPH WE NEED TO SEE 
MORE OF THE REAL BORIS NOT LESS 
WHY THATRY SAYING THIS 
THE PRESS 
WOULD LIKE A DEBATE WHICH DOES NOT 
CONCENTRATE ON THE MATTERS WHICH 
MATTER TO LONDONERS AND TAKE TAKEN 
OFF ON A POLICY OF PERSONALITIES 
YOU ARE BEING RESTRAINED IT IS THE 
MINDERS THE SPIN DOCTORS THEY 
DON'T WANT YOU PUT UNDER TOO MUCH 
SCRUTINY 
HERE I AM SUBMITTING SCRUTINY MYSELF TO YOUR INTERROGATION 
HAPPILY AND WANTING TO GET MY 
MESSAGE ACROSS IF I CAN TO THE 
PEOPLE OF LONDON ABOUT THEIR 
PROBLEMS AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE 
YOU DON'T ACCEPT IT IS PROBLEM 
WHAT IT GOES TO PEOPLE'S MINDS IS 
IT REVEALS THE WEAKNESS YOU ARE 
SOMEONE WHO UNTIL RECENTLY HAS 
HARDLY SPOKEN ABOUT LONDON MATTERS 
AS AN M. P. PEOPLE WILL NOT BE 
CONVINCED YOU UNDERSTAND FULLY 
LONDON'S PROBLEMS 
I THINK 
LONDONERS ARE INCREASINGLY 
INTERESTED IN WHAT I HAVE TO SAY 
ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS AND THEIR 
ISSUES AFTER EIGHT YEARS IN WHICH 
THEY HAVE HAD A MAYOR WHO TAKES AN 
INCREASING SHARE OF THE COUNCIL TAX 
IT HAS GONE UP ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE PER CENT THEY HAVE SEEN 
APPALLING EXAMPLES OF WASTE AND 
XAGGAPBS THROWING AWAY MONEY ON 
USELESS SCHEMES THEY WANT SOMEONE 
WHO WILL OFFER CHANGE AND FRESH 
THINKING I HAVE LIVED IN LONDON 
FOR A HUGE PART OF MY LIFE L. GREW 
UP HERE AS A KID L. KNOW AND LOVE 
THIS CITY WELL NOT ONLY THE 
CURRENT LABOUR MAYOR HAS A MONOPOLY 
OVER LOVE OF LONDON AND A DESIRE TO 
CHANGE LONDON FOR THE BETTER WE WE START WITH BUSES IT IS A MAJOR 
PLANK OF YOUR CAMPAIGN YET IT HAS 
BEEN PAINFUL TRYING TO EXTRACT FULL 
GENUINE COSTINGS FOR YOUR PROPOSAL 
TO GET RID OF THE BENDY BUSES AND 
BRING BACK BUSSING CONDUCTORS HAVE 
YOU GOT A FIGURE 
WE WANT TO PHASE 
OUT THE BENDY BUS AND INTRODUCE A 
NEW GENERATION ROUTEMASTER BUS WE 
THINK WE CAN DO IT FOR ONE HUNDRED MILLION 
WE FINALLY GOT THAT FIGURE WE GOT 
IT FROM MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC OUT 
IN THE STREETVY 
REPEATEDLY GIVEN 
THAT FIGURE 
SINCE WHEN SINCE 
WEDNESDAY 
IT WILL BE READILY WEDNESDAY FINANCED BY THE BUDGET THAT THE 
CURRENT MAYOR HAS PUT IN PLACE FOR 
HIS FIVE HUNDRED NEW HYBRID BUSES L. SUGGEST 
MORE CONCERN SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO 
HIS COSTINGS 
HYBRID IS PART DIESEL 
AND PART ELECTRIC WOULD YOU MAKE 
YOUR BUSES THAT 
CAN I TELL YOU 
SOMEBODY THIS BUS HAS NOT BEEN 
DESIGNED YET AS YOU KNOW WELL HOW HOW CAN YOU BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE 
COSTS ARE WHEN NO ONE ELSE USES ONE 
IN THE WORLD AND NO ONE HAS 
DESIGNED A BUS LIKE THIS 
WE THINK 
WE CAN BRING IT IN FOR ONE HUNDRED MILLION 
IT WILL BE READILY FINANCED BY THE 
TFL BUDGET SET ASIDE 
THAT WOULD 
BE 
CAN I SAY WHY 
THAT WOULD BE BE THE BUS UNWRAPPED THEN OF COURSE 
YOU HAVE TO RUN THE BUSES YOU 
FAMOUSLY SAY IT WOULD INVOLVE 
CONDUCTORS AND COST EIGHT MILLION YOU 
SAY EVERY BUS WOULD NEED THREE 
SHIFTS OF CONDUCTORS THREE TIMES 
EIGHT THAT IS TWENTY FIVE MILLION WE WE WOULD BRING IN THE PACKAGE FOR ONE HUNDRED 
MILLION 
THAT WAS YOUR REPLACEMENT MILLION COST FOR THE ACTUAL BUS ON THE 
RUNNING OF BUSES HOW MUCH WILL IT 
COST TO RUN THEM 
I HAVE GIVEN YOU 
THE FIGURE IT WILL BE ONE HUNDRED MILLION 
NOT EVERYBODY IN THIS GAME HAS TO 
BE JEREMY PAX MAN WHAT THE PUBLIC 
WANT TO KNOW IS WHY I AM BRINGING 
IN A NEW BUS AND WHY IT IS TIME TO 
REPLACE THE BENDY BUS LET ME TELL 
YOU 
THAT FIGURE ASSUMED IT WILL BE YOU INCREASING THE NUMBER OF BUSES THREE HUNDRED THIRTY 
BENDY BUSES 
WE MAKE NO SUCH 
ASSUMPTIONMENT YOU ARE TRYING TO 
READ TOO MUCH INTO YOU ARE TRYING 
TO IMPUTE ALL DETAIL PLANS WHICH 
DON'T SO FAR EXIST THIS BUS HAS 
NOT YET BEEN DESIGNED 
YOU ACCEPT 
IT WILL NEED TO BE DRIVEN THAT IS 
ANOTHER COST MORE MILLIONS WHAT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS REPLACE THE BENDY 
BUS I DON'T THINK IT IS SUITABLE 
FOR LONDON'S STREETS IT IS TOO 
LONG VERY DANGEROUS AND IT IS A 
HUGE INVITATION TO FRAUD AND TO 
CRIME AND WE ARE LOSING FIFTY 
MILLION A YEAR IN LOST FARE REVENUE 
ON THE BUSES WE CAN DO BETTER YOU YOU WILL GET THE FATHER FROM EVASION 
AND THAT WOULD PAY FOR YOUR BUSES 
TRANSPORT FOR LONDON WILL NEXT YEAR 
SPEND ONE HUNDRED TEN MILLION ON CONSULTANTS 
FOR LONDON L. THINK LOOKING AT THE 
PRIORITIES OF THE PEOPLE OF LONDON 
I THINK THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE 
FEW MORE CONDUCTORS AND LESS 
CONSULTANTS 
THERE IS A LOT TO BE CONSULTANTS ESTABLISHED 
YOU'VE HAD A JOLLY ESTABLISHED GOOD GO AT TRYING TO GET ANOTHER 
FIGURE OUT OF ME I HAVE STUCK 
RESOLUTELY TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION 
METRONET HAS COLLAPSED P. P. P. WOULD 
YOU FIND ANOTHER CONSORTIUM TO 
REPLACE METRONET ARE YOU HAPPY IT 
SHOULD BE TAKEN OVER BY TRANSPORT 
FOR LONDON HAS IT ENOUGH MONEY TO 
MAKE THIS WORK 
THE KEY THING AS WE 
GO FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THE NEXT 
GENERATION OF CONTACTS DON'T TURN 
INTO A HUGE RIP OFF FOR THE 
TAXPAYER I AM WORRIED THAT TFL 
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL COSTS 
IN THE WAY IT SHOULD THAT IS WHY I 
WANT TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT ARBITER 
THERE TO GUARANTEE TAXPAYER TO SAY 
LISTEN CONTRACTORS IT IS NO GOOD 
YOU SAY THE COSTS ARE SPIRALLING 
OUT OF CONTROL YOU HAVE TO DELIVER 
VALUE FOR THE PEOPLE OF LONDON SAY SAY IT IS TWO THOUSAND TEN AND THERE IS NOT ENOUGH 
MONEY HOW CAN YOU MAKE THE CASE 
DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE ANY 
EXPERIENCE WITH THE TREASURY ABOUT 
EXTRACTING MORE MONEY 
IT IS TRAGIC 
WE'VE HAD A LABOUR MAJOR FOR EIGHT 
YEARS WHO HAS COMPLETELY FAILED 
HE OPPOSED P. P. P. HE IS RIGHT YOU YOU ASKED IF I WOULD BE A TOUGH 
NEGOTIATOR WE HAVE FAILED TO GET 
VALUE LONDON CONTRIBUTES TWENTY 
BILLION WE RECEIVE ONLY TWELVE PER CENT OF 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND CONTRIBUTE 
NINETEEN PER CENT TO THE U. K. ECONOMY THE TUBE 
NETWORK IS AT THE HEART OF THE 
MOTOR OF THE U. K. ECONOMY IT 
DESERVES MUCH BETTER FINANCING 
ANYBODY WHO SEEKS TO BE MAYOR WILL 
PUT THAT AT THE TOP OF HIS 
PRIORITIES IF GORDON BROWN DECIDES 
TO UNDERFUND THE TUBE HE WILL CUT 
HIS OWN THROAT AND THAT OF THE U. K. 
WHAT ABOUT DAVID CAMERON AND HE WAS 
UNDERSTPUPBLDING 
I WOULD MAKE UNDERSTPUPBLDING AND UNDERFUNDING 
I WOULD MAKE THE 
SAME POINT 
HOW WILL YOU REDUCE 
THIS COUNCIL TAX WHICH YOU SAY HAS 
GONE UP UNJUSTIFYABLY 
I THINK IT 
INCRED THABL THE LABOUR MAYOR HAS 
WASTED THIRTY FOUR MILLION ON A CULL ON 
THEATION OF THE LONDON TRAM HE HAS 
FOUR MILLION OF THE 
I WOULD NOT MAKE ANY CUTTING IN THE 
POLICING BUDGET 
COUNCIL TAX WOULD 
NOT COME DOWN VERY MUCH 
THERE ARE 
SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY EMPLOYEES AT CITY HALL WHERE 
THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THEY ARE CUTTING 
DESKS IN HALF WE ARE PAYING 
LONDONERS A PENNY 
THE MAIN 
AMOUNT GOES ON POLICE OFFICERS 
THERE IS A LIMIT TO WHAT YOU CAN DO 
UNLESS YOU TAKE POLICE OFFICERS OFF 
THE STREET LIKE SOME SAY THE 
CONSERVATIVES DID IN THE EIGHTIES AND 
NINETIES 
I DON'T ACCEPT YOUR ASSERTION NINETIES THESE ECONOMIES ARE LIKE THIS IF 
WE HAVE A LONDON WHERE THE MAYOR IS 
JETING OFF TO VENEZUELA WHERE HE 
IS ASKING LONDONERS TO PAY FOR THE 
SOCIAL FUND FOR MARXISTS AND 
ANACHISTS FOR A WEIRD PYONGYANG 
FREE SHEET AND THE LONDON TWO TWO MILLION 
WE CAN MAKE SAVINGS TO THE MILLION BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE OF LONDON 
WHO WILL YOU DO THIS WITH YOU KNOW 
THERE HAS BEEN INCREASING PRESSURE 
ON YOU TO TALK ABOUT YOUR TEAM 
THERE IS CONSERVATIVE COUNCILLOR 
GOING AROUND SAYING HE WILL BE YOUR 
CHAIRMAN OF THE TFL BOARD HAVE YOU 
MADE UP YOUR MIND ON THAT 
YOU CAN 
PULL OUT MY TOW NAILS ON THIS SHOW 
YOU WILL NOT EXTRACT THE NAMES OF 
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO NOT NOT EVEN A CHIEF OF STAFF A HEAD OF 
POLICING THESE KEY POSITIONS YOU 
KNOW WHY PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW IT IS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE THINKING CAN WE 
TRUST THIS MAN'S JUDGMENT WE NEED 
TO KNOW WHO IS THERE PROPPING HIM 
OUP 
LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KNOCKING 
ON MY DOOR SAYING THEY WANT TO COME 
AND HELP 
WHY WON'T YOU TELL US 
SOME ARE STILL IN THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR IN HIGH PROFILE JOBS AND IT 
WOULD BE WRONG IN ADVANCE OF THE 
ELECTION TO NAME THEM BECAUSE IT 
WOULD PREJUDICE THE POSITION CAN CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE 
ASKING THAT SEEMS TO BE THE 
CRUCIAL THING WHO WILL BE WITH 
HIM 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS HIM THERE IS AN INTERESTING DETAIL L. 
AM MORE TRUSTED BY THE PUBLIC TO 
DELIVER GOOD TEAM A LONDON THAN 
THE CURRENT MAYOR IF YOU LOOK AT 
WHAT'S GOING ON IN CITY HALL AND 
HIS FAILURE TO CONTROL COSTS AND 
THE RAMPANT CRONYISM 
NOBODY CAN GO 
IN NOT KNOWING WHAT TEAM BORIS 
TEAM BORIS ON DAY ONE WILL PUT 
EVERY POUND WE SPEND ON BEHALF OF 
THE PEOPLE OF LONDON ON THE 
INTERNET SO THEY CAN INSPECT IT AND 
SEE WHERE THEIR MONEY IS GOING WE 
WILL MAKE SURE THAT ALL MERYL 
ADVISERS PUT THE INTEREST ON THE 
WEB SO THE PUBLIC 
WHAT KIND OF 
RELATIONSHIP WILL BORIS JOHNSON 
HAVE WITH THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
WITH ITS LEADER AND PERHAPS A 
FUTURE CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER 
WOULD YOU DISPLAY THE SAME LEVEL OF 
INDEPENDENCE 
I WILL STICK UP FOR INDEPENDENCE LONDONERS AND THE INTERESTS OF THIS 
CITY I THINK IT IS VITAL TO GET 
THINGS RIGHT 
YOU'RE OUT 
CAMPAIGNING A FEW DAYS AGO AND 
SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS 
REVEALING YOU HAD JUST GIVEN A 
SPEECH ON WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO 
IN LONDON L. L. WAS INTERVIEWING DAVID 
CAMERON AND THEN YOU FORGOT ONE OF 
YOUR PLEDGES 
YOU HAVE HEARD HIM 
TODAY 
I WANT TO MAKE ONE FINAL TODAY POINT WHICH IS RELEVANT TO THIS 
AREA AND THAT IS I WON'T SUPPORT 
I WILL OPPOSE A THIRD RUNWAY 
THERE IS NO REASON FOR A THIRD 
RUNWAY I KNOW I AM INTERRUPTING AN 
IMPORTANT TELEVISION INTERVIEW BUT 
IT IS WORTH MAKING THAT POINT 
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE 
ENTRENCHING A GROSS PLANNING ERROR 
OF THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND NINETEEN FIFTIES BY 
DEVELOPING HEATHROW AIRPORT 
SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY THIS MAN WON'T 
GIVE A MONKEY'S ABOUT THE 
SENSITIVITY OF THE PARTY SOME 
PEOPLE WILL THINK YOU ARE 
EMBARRASSING AND LIABILITY I I WILL SPEAK UP FOR LONDONERS IT IS 
TIME WE HAD A PROPER DEBATE ABOUT 
ALTERNATIVES TO EXPANDING HEATHROW 
IT SHOULD BE THE JOB OF THE MAYOR 
OF LONDON TO LEAD A NATIONAL DEBATE 
I DON'T SEE WHY WE SHOULDN'T TALK 
ABOUT AS I HAVE SAID THE HONG 
KONG SOLUTION LOOKING AT WHAT THE 
FRENCH DID 
WHERE ELSE DO YOU SEE 
YOU WILL TAKE AN INDEPENDENT STAND 
AREAS OF CONSERVATIVE PARTY YOU DO 
NOT LIKE 
I DON'T WANT 
UNNECESSARILY TO PRECIPITATE 
DIVISION BETWEEN MYSELF AND ANY 
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE I WANT TO WORK 
IN HARMONY WITH GOVERNMENT TO 
ACHIEVE THE BEST OUTCOMES FOR 
LONDON I WILL INSIST THAT LONDON 
IS PROPERLY FUNDED 
WE KNEW ABOUT 
KEN LIVINGSTONE A VERY BRAVE 
DECISION WHICH WAS THE CONGESTION 
CHARGE HAVE YOU GOT A CONGESTION 
CHARGE IS THERE A BRAVE YOU CAN 
DO 
I WON'T BE INTRODUCING THE TWENTY FIVE DO CHARGE IT IS ENVIRONMENTALLY 
TRIVIAL WHAT I WILL BE DOING IS 
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO PAY IT ON 
ACCOUNT AT THE END OF EVERY MONTH 
SO WE DON'T GET HIT BY THE MOST BIG 
BINES 
WHAT ABOUT A BIG IDEA THAT BINES WILL SHOW PEOPLE WHO ARE 
INDEPENDENT 
A CANNOT THINK OF A INDEPENDENT BIGGER PROJECT AND THE MORE 
INTERESTING CHALLENGING IDEA AND 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD DO MORE TO 
REGENERATE EAST LONDON THAN 
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN THINK OF 
INCLUDING THE OLYMPICS 
IF YOU DID 
NOT WIN WOULD YOU HAVE ANOTHER GO 
IN FOR YEARS 
I INTEND TO WIN NOW 
AND I AM DELIGHTED TO SAY 
EVERYWHERE I GO ACROSS LONDON I AM 
FINDING PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTENING TO 
A MESSAGE WHICH IS ABOUT MAKING 
THEIR LIVES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES 
SAFER THERE ARE SO MANY BENEFITS 
FROM INCREASED SAFER ECONOMIC 
SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS 
I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENT THAT ON 
FIRST LONDONERS WILL WANT TO CHANGE 
FROM A STALE TIRED ADMINISTRATION 
WHICH HAS RUN OUT OF IDEAS 
YOU CAN 
SEE MORE ON BORIS JOHNSON'S 
POLICIES ON OUR WEBSITE 
NOW ON THIRTIETH APRIL NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT MORE THAN 
SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE TOOK PART IN THE ROCK 
AGAINST RACISM CARNIVAL IN VICTORIA 
PARK IN EAST LONDON IT WAS THE 
CULMINATION OF A SERIES OF ANTI 
RACIST GIGS THAT HAPPENING ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY THEY WERE SET AGAINST 
A BACKDROP OF RIOTS AND PROTESTS 
AGAINST THE NAZI GROUPS AND THE 
NATIONAL FRONT DID IT CHANGE 
PEOPLE'S MINDS WAS IT PREACHING TO 
THE CONVERTED WE ASKED FIREFIGHTER 
FILM MAKER ALAN 
THIS IS WHERE I PUT ALL MY FILMS 
TOGETHER THIS IS MY EDIT SUITE 
DO ALL MY CUTTING AND PUT THE FILMS 
TOGETHER AT HOME L. HAVE ALL MY 
TAPE STUCK BEHIND ME HAVE THE 
ARCHIVE FOOTAGE IS ON THE HARD 
DRIVES THE FILM MAKING STARTED FOR 
ME DURING THE NATIONAL FIREFIGHTERS 
STRIKE OF TWO THOUSAND TWO L. L. WAS TAKING MY 
CAMERA TO DAMOS AND RCHES L. AM A 
BIT TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER THE 
VICTORIA PARK WILL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT L. 
FOUND MY POLITICS ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WITH 
GROUPS LIKE THE SPECIALS THE BODY 
SNATCHERS IT WAS AFTER THE 
LEWISHAM RIOTS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE ANTI 
NAZI LEAGUE WAS SET UP ALMOST LIKE 
A SISTER ORGANISATION TO ROCK 
AGAINST RACISM ROCK AGAINST RACISM 
WERE PUTTING ON GIGS RIGHT ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY WHEN I GOT A CHANCE TO 
MAKE WHO SHOT THE SHERIFF WHICH 
CHARGE THE RISE OF ROCK AGAINST 
RACISM FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE IT WAS 
EXCITING BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN MUSIC 
AND POLITICS CAME TOGETHER IT 
CHALLENGED PARTIES LIKE THE 
NATIONAL FRONT AT THAT TIME L. 
THINK THE CARNIVAL IN VICTORIA PARK 
THIRTY YEARS AGO CHANGED PEOPLE'S 
PERSPECTIVE OF BRITAIN AT THAT TIME 
IT WAS POLITICS WITH A SMALL P. NOT 
ONLY DID THEY FEEL PART OF SOME IN 
IT MADE AND HE RACISM COOL POP AND 
POLITICS MIX WELL ON A SMALL SCALE 
GRASSROOTS LEVEL IT IS WHEN PEOPLE 
FEEL PART OF SOMETHING AND THEY ARE 
PUTTING ON THEIR OWN EVENTS UP AND 
DOWN THE COUNTRY IT IS NOT JUST 
ABOUT THE BIG GROUPS BUT ALSO THE 
SMALL ONES THAT IS WHY ROCK 
AGAINST RACISM WAS SO SUCCESSFUL 
YEARS AGO AND WHY IT IS SO STRONG 
TODAY TODAY WITH US IN THE STUDIO IS RHODA 
DAKAR OR A SINGER AND TOBY YOUNG 
AN ASSOCIATION 
WE ARE ROUGHLY OF THE SAME VINTAGE 
FOR THIS DISCUSSION DID THE ROCK 
AGAINST RACISM CONCERTS AND THE 
ANTI NAZI LEAGUE CHANGE ANYTHING 
WHAT THEY DO IS HEIGHTEN AWARENESS 
WHETHER THEY CHANGE ANYBODY'S MIND 
I COULD NOT SAY THINK PEOPLE 
WHEN THEY RUBS SHOULDERS WITH 
SOMEBODY WHO THINKS DIFFERENTLY AND 
THEY ARE PRESENTED WITH A DIFFERENT 
ARGUMENT IT GIVES THEM SCOPE TO 
DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER IT IS 
SOMETHING THEY WISH TO FOLLOW I I THINK YOU WERE AT A CONCERT IN 
VICTORIA PARK 
I WAS REMEMBER 
LEAVING DIRECTLY AFTER THE CLASH 
PLAYED BUT BE WARNED BEFORE AS 
WHAT CAME ON A THING ABOUT FOUR 
FIFTHS OF THE PEOPLE THERE LEFT AND 
I DON'T THINK THE MESSAGE GOT 
ACROSS TO THOSE IN THE PARK ON THAT 
DAY 
YOU'RE SAYING ESSENTIALLY DAY THESE WERE YOUNG PEOPLE IT MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN ORGANISED BY ROCK AGAINST 
RACISM BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN 
ORGANISED BY ANYBODY COS THESE 
PEOPLE HAD TURNED UP TO LISTEN TO 
THE MUSIC 
I THINK SO WHENEVER 
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE ROCK AND 
ROLL INDUSTRY GET UP ON THEIR HIGH 
HORSE I THINK A LOT OF FANS OF 
ROCK'N'ROLL MUSIC IMMEDIATELY TURN 
OFF I THINK IT IS NAIVE TO THINK A 
FEW WELL INTENTIONED MUSICIANS CAN 
DO SOMETHING ABOUT A PROBLEM WHICH 
IS SO WIDESPREAD AND ENDEMIC WHICH 
HUMAN HISTORY TEACHES US IS GOING 
TO BE HERE FOR ALL ETERNITY I 
THINK 
DID YOU ACTUALLY BUY ANY THINK CLASH RECORDS 
I DID 
THERE WAS NO 
PREACHING BY THE CLASH OF COURSE I I BOUGHT THEIR FIRST ALBUM AND THEN 
I THINK THEY GOT WORSE 
BEFORE FIFTH 
OF THE AUDIENCE WOULD CLASH FANS 
AND THEY WERE LISTENING TO WHAT 
THEY WERE SAYING YOU ALREADY 
TAKING IN WHAT THEY WERE SAYING SO 
I THINK YOUR POINT IS MOOT THERE THERE WAS A B. B. C. POLL CARRIED OUT THIS 
WEEK TO COMMEMORATE THE FORTIETH 
ANNIVERSARY OF ENOCH POWELL'S 
FAMOUS SPEECH AND DISCOVERED 
SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY PER CENT OF THE BRITISH 
POPULATION CONSIDERED THEMSELVES 
RACIALLY PREJUDICED TWO THIRDS 
THINK RACIAL RELATIONS ARE SO POOR 
THEY WILL ERUPT IN VIOLENCE IN THE 
NEAR FUTURE WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE 
THAT ROCK AGAINST RACISM HAS HAD 
ANY IMPACT 
THERE WAS A SONG ABOUT 
FREE NELSON MANDELA THAT BECAME 
SOMETHING OF THEM AND SOME AND 
THEM FEED THE WORLD IF YOU WANT 
TO GO FORWARD A TINY BIT 
IF YOU 
FOCUS ON SMALL INDIVIDUAL GOALS 
THEN ROCK AND ROLL CAN FORM A PART 
OF A LARGER PROTEST MOVEMENT WHEN 
IT COMES TO SOMETHING LIKE 
COMBATTING RACISM AMONGST THE 
GENERAL POPULATION THINGS LIKE 
ROCK AGAINST RACISM HAVE A CLIMATE 
IN WHICH ANYONE WHO QUESTIONS 
IMMIGRATION POLICIES ARE 
IMMEDIATELY BRANDED A RACIST IT IS 
ATTRIBUTED TO POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 
THIS IS THE POINT TREVOR PHILLIPS 
THE HEAD OF THE COMMISSION FOR 
EQUALITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS WILL MAKE 
THIS EVENING 
THE POINT IS IT IS A 
BIT GLIB TO SAY THE WORLD NEEDS TO 
BE FED OF COURSE THE POINT IS 
THIS IS A CONTRIBUTION PEOPLE 
MAKING AN EFFORT TO PUSH THE AGENDA 
FORWARD IT IS NOT ABOUT WE WILL 
SING THIS SONG AND EVERYTHING WILL 
BE ALL RIGHT NOBODY IS SUGGESTING 
THAT BUT TO MAKE A POINT OF SAYING 
THAT MUSIC AND POLITICS DO NOT 
ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE I THINK 
HIS 
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN AT CONCERTS HIS WERE WHOEVER THE PERFORMER IS WE 
WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THIS 
SITUATION SOMEWHERE AND THE 
TERRIBLE THINGS BEING DONE BY THE 
GOVERNMENT OF YOUR TOES START 
CURLING INSIDE YOU SHOOT THAT IT IS 
IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONCERT THE THE POINT IS THE MESSAGE SHOULD BE IN 
MUSIC FOR ME IT SHOULD BE IN MUSIC 
I WON'T TELL OTHER PEOPLE HOW THEY 
SHOULD SPEAK TO THEIR AUDIENCE HOW 
THEY SHOULD PUT ACROSS THEIR 
MESSAGE BUT FOR ME IT IS IN THE 
MUSIC IT IS IN THE PEOPLE YOU WORK 
WITH AND THE WAY YOU CARRY YOURSELF 
AND THE WAY YOU PRESENT YOURSELF TO 
AN AUDIENCE 
HAVE THESE CONCERTS 
GOT NO FUTURE 
THEY MAY HAVE A 
FUTURE THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS 
BUSINESS SHARED THOSE VALUES AND 
WANT TO PROMOTE THEM WHICH WHICH BUSINESS IS THAT 
THE BUSINESS OF 
FIGHTING HAS IT RACISM ISN'T ISN'T THAT AN OVERLY CYNICAL LINE 
SHOULDN'T PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT THESE ISSUES I AM JUST 
CONTRIBUTING TO AN INDUSTRY BY 
RAISING IT AND THEREFORE SAY 
NOTHING IT IS AN ARGUMENT FOR 
TOTAL APATHY AND DISENGAGEMENT FROM 
THE POLITICAL PROCESS 
THERE ARE 
MORE PRACTICAL WAYS OF ADDRESSING 
PROBLEMS LIKE THIS L. DON'T THING 
SINGING ABOUT THEM WILL MAKE ANY 
DIFFERENCE DURING THE SECOND WORLD 
WAR A POET SAID HE DID NOT THINK 
ANY POEM HE HAD WRITTEN OR ANY POET 
AND THE THEIR POEMS THAT SAVED A 
SINGLE LIFE IN THE HOLOCAUST ART 
CANNOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON SOCIAL 
INJUSTICE 
I AM SORRY IT IS PEOPLE INJUSTICE WHO HAVE AN IMPACT ON SOCIAL 
INJUSTICE WHAT YOU DO WITH ART IS 
YOU PRICK PEOPLE'S CONSCIENCE AND 
PERHAPS MAKE THEM THINK ABOUT 
ISSUES THAT ARE WORTH RAISING IT 
IS NOT MUSIC THAT WILL CHANGE THE 
WORLD IT IS PEOPLE 
WHEN YOU HAVE 
BOB GELDOF BEEN WELCOMED BY THE 
WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO 
HEAR THEIR VIEWS ON AFRICA AND 
THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE AMOUNT OF 
MONEY GIVEN TO AFRICA BY THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION ISN'T THAT EVIDENCE 
THINGS HAVE CHANGED 
THEY MAY HAVE 
HAD SOME SMALL IMPACT L. FIND IT 
DIFFICULT TO TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY 
BECAUSE HE NEVER TAKES HIS 
SUNGLASSES OFF IF HE WANTS TO BE 
TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS A WORLD 
POLITICAL LEADER WHY DOESN'T HE 
TAKE HIS SUNGLASSES OFF WHEN HE IS 
ADDRESSING THE UN 
THANKS VERY MUCH 
FOR BEING HERE L. WOULD TURN MY 
BACK ON USED LIKELY TO READ THIS 
TEXT MESSAGE 
I AM THIRTEEN YEARS OLD AND I AM 
WONDERING HOW COULD YOU PICK 
SOMEONE AS CHILDISH TO BE MAYOR OF 
LONDON ALL OF THEM SEEM PRETTY 
CHILDISH TO ME 
THANKS SOPHIE FOR THAT YOU MAKE
