JACKIE STEWART TEACHES CAPTAIN SLOW HOW TO DRIVE 
DON'T BOTHER WATCHING THE WORLD CUP 
COS WE'VE SORTED IT ALREADY 
HELLO AND WELCOME 
NOW IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR RACING CAR COMPANIES 
TO START MAKING ROAD CARS 
FERRARI FOR EXAMPLE AND LOTUS MORE RECENTLY MCLAREN 
NOW ANOTHER ONE IS HAVING A GO 
THE VERY FAMOUS 
PRODRIVE 
PRODRIVE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUBARU RALLY CARS 
THEY ALSO DESIGNED AND RUN THE ASTON MARTIN ENDURANCE CARS 
AND UNTIL LAST YEAR THE HONDA BAR F. ONE TEAM AS WELL 
A PRETTY SUCCESSFUL OPERATION THEN 
BUT AT THE CHRISTMAS PARTY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
THE BOSS OF THE COMPANY SAID 
LOOK WE'VE CONQUERED THE WORLD'S RACE TRACKS 
NOW LET'S DO THE SAME ON THE ROADS 
THIS IS WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH 
AS A BASE 
IT'S A SUBARU R. ONE CITY CAR AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE 
IS TURN IT INTO THIS 
IT'S CALLED SIMPLY THE P. TWO AND IT'S AMAZING 
THE NEW COUPE BODY WAS DONE BY THE SAME MAN 
WHO STYLED THE MCLAREN F. ONE 
DON'T THINK HOWEVER THAT THIS IS ALL SHOW 
AND NO GO 
THE ENGINE IS FROM A SUBARU IMPREZA 
BUT IT HAS A BIGGER TURBO CHARGER 
SO NOW YOU GET THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE BRAKE HORSEPOWER 
YOU ALSO GET A FUNNY LITTLE NOISE FROM THE WASTE GATE 
WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR 
SOUNDS LIKE SQUIRRELS ARE BEING PUSHED INTO THE ENGINE 
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS IT'S A SQUIRREL MINCER 
IT DOESN'T JUST SOUND LIKE A RALLY CAR EITHER 
BECAUSE IT WEIGHS ABOUT THE SAME AS A HUMAN HAIR 
IT GOES LIKE ONE TOO 
ZERO TO SIXTY 
THREE POINT EIGHT SECONDS 
TOP SPEED 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR 
SCORE HA HA HA HA 
ONE REASON WHY IT'S SO FAST IS 
BECAUSE IT HAS SOMETHING CALLED ANTI LAG 
WHICH NO ONE IN THE WORLD CAN EXPLAIN 
SO THE P. TWO THEN 
IT'S GOOD LOOKING QUICK 
AND WITH A PROJECTED PRICE OF JUST FORTY THOUSAND GOOD VALUE TOO 
AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOT TO THE REALLY GOOD STUFF YET 
IN NORMAL MODE IT HANDLES LIKE A NORMAL SUBARU IMPREZA ACTUALLY 
LOADS AND LOADS AND LOADS OF GRIP 
AND THEN THAT HINT OF UNDERSTEER 
IF I TURN THIS LITTLE KNOB HERE TO THREE 
HEE HEE HEE HEE 
THIS TURNS ON THE CAR'S ELECTRONIC BRAIN 
NOW IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT ANIMAL 
NO UNDERSTEER AT ALL 
THIS SYSTEM IS EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THAN THE ANTI LAG 
BUT ONE OF PRODRIVE'S ENGINEERS DECIDED HE'D ACTUALLY HAVE A STAB AT EXPLAINING IT 
THE CONTROL OF THE CENTRE DIFFERENTIAL CLUTCH 
IS CONTROLLED THROUGH THE COMPUTER IT LOOKS AT THE STEERING ANGLE 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR SENSORS AND ACCELEROMETERS 
AND YOU'VE GOT STEERING WHEEL POSITION 
THE SLIP ANGLE OF THE CAR THROUGH THE THROTTLE 
BUT IF YOU THEN APPLY LONGITUDINAL FORCE 
DRIVE TORQUES TO THE REAR TYRES YOU LOSE LATERAL GRIP 
THE TORQUE SPLIT THROUGH 
THE RELATIVE SPEEDS OF THE FRONT REAR DIFF DOES THAT HELP 
THE RELATIVE SPEEDS OF 
IT'S PROBABLY SIMPLER TO DEMONSTRATE THE SYSTEM 
WITH A PRACTICAL EXPERIMENT 
I'M GOING ROUND THIS CIRCLE OF CONES HERE WITH THE DIFF TURNED OFF O. K. 
I'M DOING THIRTY MILES AN HOUR AND I'M GOING WIDE BASICALLY LOOK 
IT'S GOING WIDER AND WIDER IT'S JUST UNDERSTEER 
NOW 
TURN THE DIFF ON AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
O. K. THIRTY M. P. H. TO BEAT 
THIRTY EIGHT 
FORTY 
FORTY FIVE 
IT JUST KEPT GETTING FASTER AND FASTER 
UNTIL THE INEVITABLE HAPPENED 
OH 
QUITE A CAR THEN 
NOT ONLY CAN IT BLOW YOUR MIND 
BUT ALSO EMPTY YOUR STOMACH 
EUUURRRRH NOT NICE 
I DON'T WANNA SEE THAT 
PLENTY OF SALTWATER OR GO FOR A DRIVE IN THAT 
I DON'T GET IT 
HOW DID YOU MAKE YOURSELF SICK WHEN YOU WERE DRIVING 
I WASN'T DRIVING I WAS SITTING BEHIND THE WHEEL 
WHILE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY SUMMONED UP THE CHUNKS 
YEAH IT DID THAT THE GRIP ON THIS IS PHENOMENAL IT REALLY IS 
IT'S AN AMAZING THING AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE AMAZING WHAT 
THERE'S BEEN THAT BROUHAHA ABOUT THE DEMISE OF THE BRITISH MOTOR INDUSTRY 
VAUXHALL WITH ONE THOUSAND JOBS GONE 
PEUGEOT JAGUAR CLOSING DOWN PLANTS IN COVENTRY 
ROVER HAVE GONE TVR ON THEIR UPPERS 
WELL THERE YOU GO THIS COULD BE THE ANSWER 
COULD BE BUT THEY WON'T MAKE IT WHY 
BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT THIS IS WHAT A PRODRIVE ROAD CAR WOULD BE LIKE 
IF THEY COULD BE BOTHERED TO PUT IT INTO PRODUCTION BUT THEY CAN'T 
WHAT'S THE POINT IN THAT THAT'S LIKE SAYING I COULD FLY LIKE AN EAGLE BUT I CAN'T BE BOTHERED 
IT'S JUST A TECHNOLOGICAL SHOWCASE 
IT'S THEM SAYING LOOK HOW CLEVER WE ARE 
THEY'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT IT'S A GREAT SHAME 
WE'LL FIND OUT NOW JUST HOW FAST IT GOES ROUND OUR TRACK 
THAT MEANS HANDING IT OVER TO OUR RACING DRIVER 
SOME SAY THAT THE OUTLINE OF HIS LEFT NIPPLE 
IS EXACTLY THE SAME SHAPE AS THE NUERBURGRING 
AND IF YOU GIVE HIM A REALLY IMPORTANT JOB TO DO 
HE'LL SKIVE OFF AND PLAY CROQUET 
ALL WE KNOW IS HE'S CALLED THE STIG 
WHOOPS BIT OF FLAME FROM THE EXHAUST AND HE'S OFF 
OOH LOOK AT THE CAR PITCHING ON ITS SUSPENSION 
AS THE STIG SLAMS HOME ANOTHER GEAR 
ACTIVE DIFF IS SWITCHED ON HERE 
SYSTEM CAN MAKE ANY DRIVER LOOK LIKE MICHAEL SCHUMACHER 
BUT IN STIG'S CASE THAT'D BE WORSE THAN HE IS 
LOOK HOW NEATLY HE GETS OUT THE FIRST CORNER 
DOVE POSSO COMPRARE SEMAFORO 
WHERE CAN I BUY TRAFFIC LIGHTS 
WHOA HE'S ROCKING UP IN CHICAGO GETS THE NOSE A BIT WIDE 
AND THE COMPUTER SHIFTS THE TORQUE AROUND 
DRAGS EVERYTHING BACK ON TRACK 
HAMMERHEAD THIS IS THE REAL HANDLING TEST 
SUBARU WOULD WASH WIDE 
BUT THE P. TWO'S BRAIN SHUNTS DRIVE WHERE IT'S NEEDED 
GETS THE TAIL WORKING PUNCHES HIM OUT THE OTHER SIDE 
E. SPORCO IT'S DIRTY 
GOING DOWN TO FOLLOW THROUGH DON'T THINK HE'S LIFTED AT ALL 
STIG AND COMPUTER'S WORKING TOGETHER ANIMAL AND MACHINE IN PERFECT HARMONY 
HE'S TURNING IN NOW SECOND TO LAST CORNER THAT'S VERY TIDY 
COMING UP TO GAMBON PICKING UP DUST LIKE A RALLY CAR 
AND ACROSS THE LINE 
THIS IS INTERESTING THIS 
NOW 
NOW WHEN HE DID IT HE DID A LAP IN THAT WITHOUT THE DIFF TURNED ON 
HE DID A ONE TWENTY NINE WHICH IS SORT OF WAY DOWN HERE SOMEWHERE O. K. 
BUT WITH THE DIFF ACTUALLY ACTIVATED 
HE DID IT IN ONE MINUTE TWO HUNDRED FORTY THREE 
SO IT'S HALF A SECOND QUICKER THAN AN EVO FOUR HUNDRED 
EVO HAS SIXTY MORE HORSEPOWER AND THAT'S ALL DOWN TO THE DIFF 
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW THIS DIFF WORKS I'VE PUT SOMETHING 
WELL I HAVEN'T PUT ANYTHING ON THE INTERNET ABOUT IT 
BUT JAMES MAY HAS WRITTEN SOMETHING ON OUR WEBSITE 
SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY OF THIS CAR 
GO TO BBCCO.UK SLASH TOPGEAR 
OR GO ONTO GOOGLE AND WRITE I HAVEN'T GOT ANY FRIENDS 
AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE NEWS YES IT IS 
THE BIG NEWS THIS WEEK IS IT'S TIME ONCE AGAIN FOR THE TOP GEAR SURVEY 
WE TEST CARS FOR A WEEK 
AND IN THAT TIME WE CAN WORK OUT HOW FAST THEY ARE HOW BIG THE BOOT IS 
HOW COMFORTABLE THEY ARE BUT WE CAN'T WORK OUT 
WHAT THEY'RE LIKE TO LIVE WITH AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS IS WHAT YOU DO IN THE NEWS THESE DAYS HAVE YOU NOT WATCHED THE NEWS 
THEY WALK ABOUT WITH A BIT OF PAPER THEY TALK TO ONE CAMERA AND FOR NO REASON SWITCH TO ANOTHER ONE 
AND THEN ANOTHER LIKE THAT 
ER ANYWAY THE POINT IS 
IS THAT IF YOUR CAR IS ON AN OH THREE AN OH FIVE 
AN OH FOUR 
OR A FIFTY FOUR PLATE WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU O. K. 
SO PLEASE WRITE TO US AT BBCCO.UK SLASH 
TOPGEAR 
ARE YOU GONNA STOP THAT NOW IT'S REALLY IRRITATING 
I'LL DO THE NEXT BIT LIKE CHANNEL FIVE KIRSTY YOUNG IS ALWAYS HALFWAY UP A STAIRCASE WHEN SHE DOES HERS 
UP HERE 
THAT'S LIKE NEWS POLE DANCING IT IS 
NO THAT'S WORSE THAT IS WORSE SIT DOWN JUST TRY SITTING DOWN 
I'LL GIVE IT A WHIRL IT MIGHT CATCH ON SEE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WE COULD DO THE NEWS LIKE THIS WHAT DO WE THINK I LIKE IT IT WORKS 
HERE WE GO O. K. HERE WE ARE 
WITH THE SITTING DOWN NEWS 
WHICH COMES FROM SUBARU 
WHO ARE ARRANGING A SERIES OF TRACK DAYS FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
YOU CAN GO TO THE PRODRIVE TEST TRACK AND THRASH AROUND IN AN IMPREZA OR THOSE BIGGER ONES 
WHOSE NAME LEGACY THAT'S THE ONE 
THERE'S ONLY A FEW CONDITIONS 
YOU MUST BE EIGHTEEN YEARS OR OVER 
YOU MUST HAVE HAD A FULL DRIVING LICENCE FOR OVER A YEAR 
OOH AND YOU MUST BE BETWEEN FIVE FOOT TWO AND SIX FOOT SEVEN SO THAT'S YOU TWO OUT 
EXCELLENT 
THAT'S HEIGHTIST QUITE FRANKLY 
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER RECOMMENDATION ACTUALLY THAN WHAT 
US NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT EXACTLY I'LL BE GOING I'LL SEE YOU THERE 
HEY NOW LISTEN 
I HAVE FOUND WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE PRETTY CLOSE TO THE PERFECT CAR 
YOU KNOW LAST YEAR I DROVE THE AUDI R. S. FOUR FANTASTIC THEY'VE NOW BROUGHT OUT THIS VERSION 
AN R. S. FOUR CABRIOLET NOW THAT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT'S GOING TO GET 
I THINK THAT RADIATOR GRILL IS PRETTY GOPPING THOUGH 
BUT UMA THURMAN HAS BIG HANDS YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY GET OUT 
YES 
COS SHE'S GOT BIG HANDS 
I DON'T LIKE GIRLS WITH BIG HANDS WHY DON'T YOU LIKE GIRLS WITH BIG HANDS 
IT JUST LOOKS WRONG WHAT LOOKS WRONG 
SHE SAYS HI JAMES I'M URMA WITH HER GREAT BIG HAND IT'S WRONG 
LISTEN THIS HAS GOT 
FOUR FOURTEEN B. H. P. FOUR WHEEL DRIVE GOES LIKE THE CLAPPERS 
SOUNDS WONDERFUL BRILLIANT CAR THAT 
YOU SAID THAT THE ONLY PERSON WHO EVER LOOKED GOOD 
IN THE BACK OF A FOUR SEAT CONVERTIBLE WAS ADOLF HITLER 
YES YOU DID I DID SAY THAT BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER 
BECAUSE THE FRONT SEATS IN AN R. S. FOUR ARE SO BIG AND BUCKETY 
YOU CAN'T GET ANYONE IN THE BACK ANYWAY OH BRILLIANT 
SO THE BEST THING ABOUT YOUR FOUR SEATER CABRIOLET 
IS YOU CAN ONLY FIT TWO PEOPLE IN IT YES YOU DO TALK RUBBISH 
SIXTY GRAND AS WELL GOOD VALUE HEY NOW LISTEN 
ANYONE SEE THE MONTE CARLO GRAND PRIX YEAH 
REALLY ACTUALLY NO NO I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD'VE DONE 
I DIDN'T WATCH IT EITHER THEY NEVER WATCH FORMULA ONE HERE'S THE THING 
MICHAEL SCHUMACHER IS ON HIS HOT LAP QUALIFYING LAP 
HE STOPS AND BLOCKS THE ROAD AND EVERYONE SAYS THAT'S CHEATING COS HE WAS GONNA GO ON POLE POSITION 
EVEN IF EVEN IF IT WAS CHEATING AND I'M NOT SURE THAT IT WAS 
HOW BRILLIANT IS THAT 
YOU'RE DRIVING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILES THROUGH MONTE CARLO LIKE THIS 
AND THEN YOU THINK IF I STOP HERE I'LL BLOCK THE TRAFFIC 
SO I'LL PRETEND TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT AND THERE I AM ON POLE 
HONESTLY HE'S A GENIUS THAT MAN 
THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH FORMULA ONE 
EVERYONE IS OBSESSED WITH SPORTING BEHAVIOUR 
THERE'S WHAT'S HIS NAME THE OTHER RENAULT DRIVER 
FISICHELLA FISICHELLA CHARGING DOWN THE PIT LANE 
TO PLANT ONE ON VILLENEUVE 
PEOPLE GO THAT'S NOT SPORTING IT IS 
HE'S A YOUNG MEDITERRANEAN RACING DRIVER 
AND HE WANTS TO PLANT A BIG 
ON A STUPID SHORT SIGHTED BAGGY TROUSERED CANADIAN 
AND HE SHOULD'VE GOT POINTS FOR IT 
HE SHOULD'VE GOT EXTRA POINTS FOR THAT 
ARE YOU SAYING DRIVERS SHOULD GET RANDOM POINTS YES 
WHO'LL GIVE THEM THESE POINTS MAINE OH THERE'S A SURPRISE 
YOU'LL SIT IN A BIG BOX HIGH UP OVERLOOKING THE CIRCUIT 
MAYBE WITH A CROWN MADE OF LEAVES AND A TOGA 
THEN AT THE END YOU CAN DECIDE WHETHER THEY WIN OR THEY LOSE REALLY BADLY I LIKE THE LEAVES 
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THE LEAVES 
I'D HAVE GIVEN SCHUMACHER ONE HUNDRED FOR BEING DICK DASTARDLY THERE WE ARE 
CAN WE MOVE ON I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE STRESS NO I'VE ANOTHER IDEA 
YOU KNOW PEOPLE IN SHEFFIELD NIGHTCLUBS WHO ARE ALWAYS EGGING THEIR MATES ON TO HAVE A FIGHT YES 
ALL THE PIT GARAGES SHOULD HAVE ONE 
SEE THAT ALONSO HE WERE LOOKIN' AT YOUR PIT BOARD 
HE SPILT YOUR PRACTICE LAP WHAT YOU GONNA DO YOU CAN'T DO NOTHING 
IT'D BE BRILLIANT LISTEN BERNIE IF YOU'RE WATCHING 
YOU'VE GOT MY NUMBER GIVE ME A CALL AND SOME LEAVES I'M YOUR MAN 
ON NOW TO ONE OF THE COOLEST CARS OF THE YEAR WHAT 
IT IS A FORD PEOPLE CARRIER 
THERE IT IS LOOK 
YOU KNOW LAST WEEK YOU BANGED YOUR HEAD WHILE YOU WERE DRIVING MY MERCEDES YES 
HAS THIS NO NO SERIOUSLY 
FOR ONE THING IT'S A SEVEN SEATER M. P. V. BUT IT'S REALLY COOL LOOKING 
IT'S A GREAT CAR HE'S RIGHT I'VE DRIVEN IT I'D HAVE IT AND I'M A BACHELOR 
IT DRIVES REALLY WELL AND 
WHAT I MEAN IS I LIKE IT AS A CAR 
I DON'T THINK THE SEATS SWIVEL I CAN GET A LOT OF BRIGHTLY COLOURED MOTHERCARE RUGS IN THE BACK 
YOU CAN JUST HAVE YOUR LITTLE BRUSH FOR CLEANING THE AIR VENTS 
JAMES MAY ON PARENTING BRIGHTLY COLOURED MOTHERCARE 
ANYWAY YOU GET THAT TWENTY FIVE L. FIVE CYLINDER ENGINE FROM THE FAST FOCUS ST 
SO IT SOUNDS BRILLIANT IT'S FAST IT HANDLES WELL IT'S A COOL CAR 
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THEN IS IF YOUR CONDOM BURSTS IT'S NOT A PROBLEM ANY MORE 
THERE'S YOUR ANSWER 
NOW ORDINARILY 
ORDINARILY I WOULDN'T PLUG ANY SHOW THAT THESE TWO ARE APPEARING IN O. K. 
BUT JAMES HAS RECENTLY SIGNED UP TO HOST A PROGRAMME ON SKY THIRTY TWO O. K. 
CALLED WHEN SHARKS ATTACK O. K. YEAH 
NOW THIS IS WORTH WATCHING 
BECAUSE I'VE MANAGED TO PROCURE A STILL FROM THE PRODUCTION OF JAMES 
AND HERE IT IS 
THIS IS A SHOW YOU CANNOT MISS 
IS THAT LEGAL IN THIS COUNTRY 
IT'S THE BARBIE DOLL THING HERE THE KEN AND BARBIE CROTCH 
THERE'S NOTHING HAPPENING NO 
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE LAUGHING 
HANG ON I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING SILLY LATELY 
THERE WAS A PICTURE IN THE PAPER LAST WEEK WHICH I'VE GOT ON YOUR GRAIL PROGRAMME 
THE PUBLICITY SHOT HERE IT IS 
HOW SMALL WAS THAT HORSE 
IT WAS RICHARD SAYS HAVE YOU GOT A MY LITTLE PONY 
I SAW IT AND THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT HORSES LOOK LIKE WHEN I GET ON THEM 
SO GOD KNOWS WHAT THAT WAS 
ANYWAY THAT IS THE END OF THE NEWS 
NOW WE MUST MOVE ON YOU REMEMBER LAST YEAR 
I WENT OUT TO CALIFORNIA AND DROVE A HONDA N. S. X. ROUND A RACE TRACK 
IT WAS TO DO WITH RACING A TIME I'D SET ON A PLAYSTATION GAME 
I DID IT IN ONE M. I. N. FIFTY EIGHT O. K. 
AFTER A COUPLE OF LAPS I GOT TO ONE M. I. N. FIFTY EIGHT 
AND THEN NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I WENT ROUND I COULDN'T GO ANY FASTER THAN THAT 
IT WAS MY LIMIT OF TALENT AND BRAVERY YEAH 
AND AFTER JEREMY'S FRANKLY USELESS EFFORTS WERE PUT ON THE TELEVISION 
A SCOTTISH LADY CALLED JACKIE STEWART WROTE TO US SAYING 
SHE COULD GET ANY ONE OF US 
TO ANY RACE TRACK IN THE COUNTRY IN ANY CAR GET US TO SET OUR BEST TIME 
AND THEN SHE COULD GET US TO KNOCK TWENTY SECONDS OFF THAT TIME 
HE IT'S A HE 
JACKIE STEWART'S A HE 
RIGHTO 
ANYWAY THE POINT IS WE DECIDED TO ACCEPT HIS CHALLENGE 
ONLY WE GAVE HIM THE MOST DIFFICULT PUPIL OF THEM ALL 
HIM 
YOU FIND ME IN UNFAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS 
THIS IS A RACE TRACK 
THIS IS MY BAG OF GO FASTER CLOTHING 
AND I'M HERE FOR MY DATE WITH SIR JACKIE 
AND HERE HE IS 
MAKING A TYPICALLY UNDERSTATED RACING DRIVER'S ENTRANCE 
JACKIE STEWART IS A LEGEND ONE OF THAT ELITE BAND OF DRIVERS 
WHO'VE WON THE F. ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP THREE TIMES 
AND I'M GUESSING HERE 
I THINK HE'S ALSO QUITE PROUD OF BEING SCOTTISH 
IMMEDIATELY I LET THE MCLEGEND KNOW WHAT HE WAS IN FOR 
YOU KNOW THEY CALL ME CAPTAIN SLOW DO THEY YEAH 
WELL I'VE SEEN THE BIGGER GUY DRIVE VERY AGGRESSIVELY 
M. M. M. AND NOT VERY WELL I THOUGHT 
SO DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT 
NEVER HAVING DRIVEN WITH YOU BEFORE IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY 
I'D BE SURPRISED IF YOU DIDN'T TURN OUT TO BE BETTER THAN THE OTHER TWO 
I LIKE THAT 
FOR THIS COACHING SESSION 
JACKIE HAD INSISTED ON A REAR WHEEL DRIVE CAR 
SO WE CHOSE THE NEW TVR TUSCAN TWO CONVERTIBLE 
BECAUSE ACTUALLY IT'S A CAR WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN 
FIRSTLY BECAUSE TVR CLAIMS IT'S THEIR BEST BUILT BEST DRIVING CAR TO DATE 
AND SECONDLY WITH ALL THEIR PRESENT BUSINESS PROBLEMS 
IT COULD WELL BE THE COMPANY'S SWAN SONG 
BEFORE SCHOOL BEGAN JACKIE TOOK THE TVR OUT TO SET HIS OWN LAP TIME 
I'M SCARED ALREADY 
JACKIE STEWART IS SIXTY SIX A PENSIONER 
EXCEPT NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE TOLD HIM THAT 
THAT WARMED THE TYRES UP 
OVER THE TOP AND LIGHTLY BRAKE 
GENTLY GET BACK ON THE POWER 
SO FAR OFF THE POWER DOWN INTO SECOND 
LET IT ROLL IN 
YOU CAN'T SEE HALF OF THIS TRACK AS YOU'RE GOING ALONG IT 
NO I KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE CHARMING THINGS ABOUT IT 
RIGHT 
SIR JACKIE STEWART YOU DID IT IN 
ONE M. I. N. FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE 
NOW IT WAS MY TURN 
THE MAIN THING TO DO IS TAKE YOUR TIME TO BEGIN WITH 
I MIGHT STILL BE TAKING MY TIME AT THE END OF THE DAY 
LET'S WAIT AND SEE 
FOR MY FIRST FEW LAPS JACKIE LIKE SUPERNANNY SAID NOTHING AND JUST OBSERVED 
MEANWHILE HIS RACE ENGINEER 
MONITORED MY TIMES USING THE IN CAR TELEMETRY 
TWO MINUTES TWENTY SIX SECONDS 
SOD IT 
COME ON 
NO MATTER WHAT I DID I COULDN'T IMPROVE IT 
YOU'RE GONNA GO SHORT OF ROOM HERE 
IT SEEMED I'D HIT MY TALENT WALL 
JUST AS JEREMY DID AT LAGUNA SECA 
JACKIE'S TARGET OF KNOCKING MY TIME DOWN BY TWENTY SECONDS 
LOOKED IMPOSSIBLE 
NEVERTHELESS HE SET TO WORK 
I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE TRYING TO THINK TOO MUCH 
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE DOING RATHER THAN WHAT'S COMING UP 
YEAH THE EXIT OF THE CORNER IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ENTRY OF THE CORNER 
WITH REGARDS TO SMOOTHNESS 
ONE OF THE BIG KEYS IS YOU NEVER PRESS THE GAS PEDAL 
UNTIL YOU KNOW YOU NEVER HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF 
RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS LOTS OF PEOPLE STAMP ON THE GAS PEDAL 
THINKING THEY'LL GO FASTER THEN THEY TAKE IT OFF PUT IT ON TAKE IT OFF THEN FINALLY GET IT ON AGAIN 
YOU DON'T WANNA DO THAT 
THAT WAS A NICE SOOTHING CHAT 
ON THE TRACK THOUGH THE MAN DOES LIKE TO MAKE HIS POINT 
IN IN IN IN 
IN IN IN 
BRAKE BRAKE BRAKE 
BRAKE BRAKE 
MORE POWER MORE POWER MORE POWER 
FULL POWER FULL POWER FULL POWER 
THIS IS PROBABLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IN HELL 
A TVR A RACE TRACK AND A PEDANTIC SCOTSMAN 
BUT THANKS TO A MIX OF BOSSINESS AND WISDOM 
DOWN A GEAR EARLY 
GET ALL THE WORK DONE SO YOU CAN CONCENTRATE ON FINDING SPEED ON THE CORNER 
THE LAP TIME STARTED TO TUMBLE 
TWO MINUTES TWENTY THREE SECONDS 
POWER OFF BRAKE DOWN A GEAR 
KEEP YOUR HEAD TOGETHER 
TOO BUSY YOU FEEL THE CAR RESPONDING BADLY TURN IT IN 
TURN IT IN FEED IT OUT POWER ON FULL TWO MINUTES FIFTEEN 
BY MID AFTERNOON THE TARTAN TASKMASTER HAD KNOCKED ELEVEN SECONDS OFF MY ORIGINAL TIME 
AND ALLOWED ME A TEA BREAK 
THE THING I REALLY LIKE ABOUT YOUR ERA THE SEVENTIES 
YOU JUST PUSHED THE BOUNDARIES A BIT FURTHER 
YOU GOT TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE ENVELOPE 
MORE THAN PEOPLE DO THESE DAYS I THINK 
IT WAS MORE OBVIOUS COS WE HAD LESS DOWN FORCE 
THAT'S LESS AERODYNAMIC FEWER WINGS THE CAR SLID MORE 
I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING MORE IN TERMS OF THE HAIRSTYLES 
IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT YOU'VE GOT NOW ACTUALLY 
IS IT A CASE OF IF YOU LOOK LIKE JACKIE STEWART YOU'LL GO LIKE JACKIE STEWART 
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THAT NOW AREN'T YOU WITH THE HAIR I'M HALFWAY THERE 
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER GO SEE WHAT HAPPENS O. K. 
STAY WITH IT FULL POWER 
YOU FEEL THE CAR DOING THAT I DON'T WANNA FEEL THAT 
UPSADAISY 
DON'T PUT THE POWER ON TILL YOU KNOW YOU NEVER HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF GOOD 
TWO HUNDRED TEN TWO HUNDRED TEN YEP 
JACKIE HAD NOW SLASHED MY TIME BY A MASSIVE SIXTEEN SECONDS 
BUT ANY EXTRA IMPROVEMENT WAS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER 
YOU'VE GOTTA CONCENTRATE YOU'RE NOT USING THE SAME BOARD AS BEFORE 
GET YOUR HEAD TOGETHER 
SEE YOU MISSED THAT APEX PROBABLY BY SIX FEET 
WHOA 
POWER ON ON POWER ON POWER 
TIME WAS RUNNING OUT AND WE STILL HAD TO FIND ANOTHER FOUR SECONDS 
SO HE PULLED ME IN FOR A FINAL PEP TALK 
YOU'RE QUITE BUSY HERE 
FIRST WE COMPARED HIS AND MY TELEMETRY 
AT THE TOP WE'VE GOT YOUR LAP IS IN RED AND JACKIE'S IS IN BLUE 
AND THE DIFFERENCES WERE ALARMING 
YOUR ACCELERATION HERE YOU SEE HOW UNTIDY IT IS 
WELL IT'S NOT PERFECT 
THIS IS SOMETHING HE DOES WHEN HE COACHES CURRENT FORMULA ONE DRIVERS 
BUT IF YOU CAN SHOW THEM HOW TO DO IT 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CARRY ON BEING A FORMULA ONE DRIVER 
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE DOING THAT ANY MORE 
FINALLY HE WENT INTO YODA MODE 
IF YOU'RE GOING INTO A CORNER AND I DO THAT TO YOU 
LOOK YOU'RE FALLING OVER 
IF I DO THAT TO YOU YOU LEAN INTO ME YEAH 
SO YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN 
THE CAR REACTS TO YOU IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY 
IT'S LIKE IF YOU WALK UP BEHIND A VICIOUS DOG 
IF YOU TALK TO THE DOG ON THE WAY UP 
IT WON'T BE CAUGHT BY SURPRISE AND IT WON'T DO SOMETHING UNPREDICTABLE 
OBVIOUS REALLY 
JACKIE HAD JUST OVER AN HOUR TO SHAVE OFF THOSE LAST FOUR SECONDS 
AND GET ME DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED SIX 
GO FOR IT YES YES THAT'S GOOD MORE POWER MORE POWER 
FULL POWER STEER THE ANGLE OFF 
STEER LEFT GOOD BETTER THIS TIME GENTLY OFF THE POWER 
ON POWER GOOD 
YES THAT'S GOOD TWO HUNDRED NINE 
I'D ABSORBED ALL THE MASTER'S ADVICE 
I JUST NEEDED TO HAVE FAITH IN THE SPEEDS HE SAID THE CAR COULD DO 
OVER THERE POWER ON 
NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH ONE MORE LAP FULL POWER 
YES YES GOOD VERY GOOD 
TURN IT IN TURN IT IN 
POWER ON ANGLE OFF STEERING ANGLE GOOD 
GOOD LAP SO FAR KEEP GOING IN MORE KICK IT OUT 
FULL POWER FULL 
YOU'VE JUST DONE TWENTY SIX POINT SEVEN FOUR 
HANG ON LET ME JUST 
YOU'VE DONE IT HAVE I YEP 
YOU'VE DONE SIXTY SEVEN 
YES YES I KNEW IT 
WELL DONE WELL DONE MATE 
CAPTAIN QUITE FAST 
CAN I. CAN I JUST SAY 
WATCHING THAT YOU HARDLY SPOKE AT ALL 
AH YES I MEANT TO APOLOGISE FOR THAT 
THE THING IS I WAS CONCENTRATING SO HARD ON LEARNING TO DRIVE 
I FORGOT THAT I WAS A TELEVISION PRESENTER YES 
EVIDENTLY DID YOU FORGET TO REMEMBER WHAT THE TVR WAS LIKE 
ACTUALLY I RATHER LIKED IT 
IN THE OLD DAYS YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT THAT'S A TICKET TO A FESTIVAL OF PLASTIC DEATH 
ACTUALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD AND IT HANDLED REALLY WELL 
SIR JACKIE STEWART SAID IT HANDLED WELL SHE'S A DISCERNING WOMAN 
IT'S JUST A SHAME OF COURSE THAT THE FACTORY'S CLOSING DOWN 
WE COULD DWELL ON THAT FOR AGES 
BUT WE MUST NOW PUT A STAR IN OUR BRAND NEW REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
WHEN OUR GUEST TONIGHT FIRST CAME HERE 
HE WAS SO SPECTACULAR WE NAMED A CORNER IN HIS HONOUR 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE WELCOME SIR MICHAEL FOLLOW THROUGH 
HELLO ALL RIGHT GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN HAVE A SEAT 
MICHAEL GAMBON IS HERE 
OOH 
WHAT A MAN 
NOW I'VE GOTTA BE HONEST 
I'VE GOTTA BE HONEST I'M VERY SURPRISED YOU CAME BACK AFTER YOUR LAST VISIT 
WELL I THOUGHT I WAS A HUGE SUCCESS

I'M A HOUSEHOLD NAME BECAUSE OF THAT CORNER GAMBON CORNER EVERYONE KNOWS IT 
JUDY DENCH IS AFTER ME JUDY DENCH FANCIES YOU BECAUSE 
SHE FANCIES ME LIKE MAD BECAUSE OF THAT IT MAKES ME VERY BUTCH 
WE'VE GOT A CLIP ACTUALLY HERE 
WHICH WE CAN SHOW TO YOU OF WHAT WE'RE ON ABOUT 
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WEREN'T WATCHING TOP GEAR WAY BACK 
HERE HE GOES 
O. K. WE'RE OFF THE ROAD AND THEN 
NEARLY ROLL IT OVER 
I MEAN SERIOUSLY WE'VE HAD SOME EVEN MORE SPECTACULAR OFFS 
I THINK THAT WAS THE FOURTH EVER TOP GEAR 
WE THOUGHT WE'VE JUST KILLED THE SINGING DETECTIVE 
ABOUT TIME SOMEONE KILLED HIM 
OF COURSE SINCE THEN HARRY POTTER'S COME ALONG DUMBLEDORE 
RICHARD HARRIS DID TWO FILMS THEN HE DIED 
I'M NOW ON MY THIRD 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE FIRST THING THAT'S BEEN SAID IN HARRY POTTER 
I READ THE SCRIPT AND LEARN THE LINES AND I TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT 
I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT DON'T I SORT OF 
QUITE OFTEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN OTHER FILMS I DO 
LAYER CAKE DID YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THAT 
NO IDEA REALLY 
AND THEN WHEN I DID GOSFORD PARK 
I MUST ADMIT I HADN'T READ IT BEFORE I STARTED SHOOTING 
I SAT DOWN ON THE FIRST DAY AT THE DINNER TABLE WITH MAGGIE SMITH 
AND THE WHOLE CAST AND I THOUGHT I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON 
I THOUGHT MY WIFE WAS MAGGIE SMITH 
BUT IT WASN'T 
AND ALL THROUGH THE SCENE I WAS MAKING EYES AT HER 
AND SHE SAID WHO ARE YOU LOOKING AT 
YOU STILL DO PLAYS PRESUMABLY I DO PLAYS 
THIS YEAR I'M DOING MY BEST PLAY EVER 
IT'S A PLAY BY SAMUEL BECKETT AND IT'S HALF AN HOUR LONG 
ISN'T THAT BRILLIANT AND I DON'T SPEAK 
THERE'S ONE VOICE GOING ON A TAPE RECORDER ALL THROUGH IT 
THAT'S PENELOPE WILTON 
THAT'S RECORDED SO I SIT THERE BY MYSELF AND LISTEN 
YOU SIT ON A. I SIT ON A BED ALL BY YOURSELF BY MYSELF 
FOR HALF AN HOUR AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING WEARING PYJAMAS 
DO PEOPLE COME AND SEE THIS THEY RECKON IT'S THE GREATEST PLAY EVER WRITTEN 
HOW YOU DO YOU HAVE TO REACT THEN 
WELL THERE'S A VIDEO CAMERA PROJECTING MY FACE ONTO A SCRIM 
THIRTY FOOT HIGH 
IT COMES IN IN NINE STAGES CLOSER AND CLOSER 
I CAN'T MOVE MY FACE OR IT WILL LOOK LIKE AN EXPLOSION 
I MUST KEEP VERY STILL AND THEN ACT WITHOUT MOVING 
AND ACT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WITHOUT TALKING OR MOVING 
WITHOUT TALKING OR MOVING THAT'S HARD 
THAT'S WHY THEY GOT ME FOR HIM CAN YOU LOOK GUILTY WITHOUT MOVING 
CAN I LOOK GUILTY I LOOK GUILTY ALL THE TIME UM 
I MUST SAY I TRIED ACTING THE OTHER DAY FOR SOMETHING COMING OUT LATER 
I COULD DO ANGRY EASILY THAT'S EASY 
THEY SAID CAN YOU BE TENDER NO 
BOND I COULD BE BOND YOU WERE GOING TO BE BOND 
I WAS INTERVIEWED FOR BOND WHEN I WAS YOUNG BY CUBBY BROCCOLI 
YES WE WENT UPSTAIRS AND SAT AT THE TABLE AND I LAUGHED 
I SAID I CAN'T BE BOND I'VE GOT TITS AND DOUBLE CHIN NO TEETH 
AND A BALD HEAD HE SAID SO HAS SEAN CONNERY 
WELL IT'S 
I SAID HOW DO YOU COPE WITH THE TITS WE PUT LEATHER BAGS WITH ICE ON THERE JUST BEFORE THE TAKE 
THEY GO 
WHAT SEAN CONNERY YOU'RE SAYING IS A WOMAN 
WELL THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD 
YOU ARE QUITE FAMOUS FOR MAKING STUFF UP IN INTERVIEWS 
STORIES YEAH 
YOU HAVE TO I HATE INTERVIEWS OH GOD SORRY 
I DO IT'S AWFUL SO I JUST TELL LIES 
SO IF SOMEONE I KNOW YOU ONCE TOLD AN INTERVIEWER 
YOU WERE A MEMBER OF THE ROYAL BALLET 
YES I SAID I WAS A BALLET DANCER AT THE ROYAL BALLET WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT 
AND HE SAID WHY DID YOU GIVE IT UP 
I SAID I FELL OFF THE STAGE AT THE OPERA HOUSE AND WENT THROUGH A KETTLE DRUM 
AND THEN YOU TOLD SOMEONE ELSE YOU WERE GAY YES 
I SAID I WAS GAY THE MAN SAID I PLAYED OSCAR WILDE 
HE SAID DID YOU FIND THAT DIFFICULT I SAID NO 
HE SAID WHAT ABOUT THE HOMOSEXUALITY SO THAT ANNOYED ME 
I SAID I FOUND THAT EASY BECAUSE I USED TO BE A HOMOSEXUAL 
AND HE WAS SO THICK I SAID BUT I WAS FORCED TO GIVE IT UP 
AND THEN HE ASKED THE QUESTION WHY WAS THAT 
I SAID BECAUSE IT MADE MY EYES WATER 
IT'S TRUE 
AND I THOUGHT HE'D LAUGH BUT HE DIDN'T 
HE WROTE IT DOWN 
THERE ARE THOSE PRESS JUNKETS AS WELL WHEN YOU GO ROUND 
THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO LIE WHEN THEY LAUNCH A FILM YEAH 
ACTORS HAVE TO MOVE AROUND I'VE DONE A LOT OF THAT 
YOU GET AN INTERVIEW EVERY TEN MINUTES WITH A VIDEO CAMERA 
AND THEY QUEUE UP OUTSIDE THE DOOR IN A POSH HOTEL

FIFTY POINT THREE SO THERE WE ARE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
EXACTLY THE SAME TIME AS IN FACT 
I'M FEELING GENEROUS I'LL PUT YOU ABOVE HIM 
WELL DONE 
SO 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
MICHAEL GAMBON 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING 
NOW THE CAR THAT I'VE BEEN MOST LOOKING FORWARD TO DRIVING THIS YEAR 
IS NOT THE NEW FERRARI FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
OR THE LAMBORGHINI GALLARDO SPIDER 
NO IT'S THIS THE NEW CITROEN C. SIX 
UNFORTUNATELY AS IT TURNS OUT 
JEREMY HAS ALSO BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO DRIVING THE NEW CITROEN C. SIX 
AND WELL HE'S BIGGER THAN ME 
SO HE'S DONE IT 
THIS IS THE OLD CITROEN C. X. 
AND IT WAS MAD IN EVERY WAY 
THE STEREO IS VERTICAL 
THE INDICATOR SWITCH IS HERE 
AND IT DOESN'T SELF CANCEL 
AND THE BRAKES WORK LIKE A SWITCH 
THEY'RE EITHER OFF LIKE NOW 
OR THEY'RE ON LIKE 
TRYING TO DRIVE THIS CAR THROUGH A TOWN 
WAS LIKE TRYING TO WIRE A PLUG WHILE WEARING BOXING GLOVES 
IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO END IN TEARS 
OH NO INDICATORS 
GREAT SORRY 
OOPS SORRY 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT 
I LOVED IT 
I LOVE THE ONE PRONG STEERING WHEEL 
THE SOFTNESS OF THE SEATS 
THE SOFTNESS OF THE SUSPENSION AND THE SPACE 
THERE WAS ENOUGH ROOM BACK HERE TO STAGE A SMALL TENNIS TOURNAMENT 
THE C. X. WAS JUST SO DIFFERENT SO LEFT FIELD 
AND THAT'S WHY I WAS SAD SIX YEARS AGO 
WHEN CITROEN ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'D STOPPED MAKING BIG INSANE CARS FOR GOOD 
ONLY NOW THEY'RE BACK 
THE ORIGINAL SKETCHES FOR WHAT THEY HAD IN MIND 
SHOW SOMETHING RADICALLY DIFFERENT TO THE B. M. W. AND MERCEDES NORM 
SOMETHING NOT AT ALL GERMAN 
AND THIS IS WHAT RESULTED 
IT'S BEEN TONED DOWN A BIT FROM THOSE ORIGINAL DRAWINGS 
BUT IT STILL HAS FOUR PILLARLESS DOORS 
A CONCAVE REAR WINDSCREEN 
AND SUSPENSION THAT LETS IT MOVE ABOUT WHILE IT'S STANDING STILL 
IT'S THE SAME STORY WITH THE INTERIOR 
IF YOU GO FOR THE CREAM LEATHER IT'S A PLEASANT PLACE TO SIT 
MUCH MORE PARIS THAN BERLIN 
AND THAT'S ALL VERY NICE BUT WHERE IS THE LUNACY 
YES IT'S GOT DOUBLE GLAZING SO IT'S VERY QUIET AND YES 
IT'S GOT A HEAD UP DISPLAY AND YES THERE'S A FEATURE IN THE SEAT 
THAT VIBRATES IF I STRAY OVER THE WHITE LINES 
WHICH IS NICE IF YOU'RE A BACHELOR 
BUT I WANT IT TO FEEL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO ANY OTHER CAR 
I WANT TO START IT BY LICKING A PANEL HERE ON THE STEERING WHEEL 
I WANT THE GEAR LEVER TO BE MADE FROM RHUBARB 
AND STICK OUT OF THE SUN VISOR 
I WANT TO FEEL LIKE I'M IN A SALVADOR DALI PAINTING 
AND IT'S ALL MELTING 
SO HOW DOES IT STACK UP 
IS THIS AN INDICATOR YES IT IS IT SHOULDN'T BE 
THAT SHOULD BE THE BOOT RELEASE 
THE INDICATOR SHOULD BE IN HERE SOMEWHERE IT'S ALL WRONG 
WRONG WRONG WRONG 
AS A CAR IT'S CONVENTIONAL TOO IT'S FRONT WHEEL DRIVE RATHER THAN SIDE WHEEL DRIVE 
AND PRICES START AT TWENTY NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
RATHER THAN TWENTY NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ZARGS 
THE STEERING WHEEL IS CIRCULAR 
THE SEATS ARE GERMAN HARD AND WHILE THERE'S ENOUGH SPACE IN THE BACK FOR ME 
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH TO TAKE A DOG FOR A WALK 
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN THE BACK OF A BIG CITROEN 
SO IT'S STARTING TO LOOK LIKE THE CHEESE EATING SURRENDER MONKEYS 
HAVE BOTTLED IT 
AND NOW WE GET TO THE MOST DISAPPOINTING THING OF THEM ALL 
THE HANDLING 
A BIG CITROEN SHOULD FLOP ABOUT 
LIKE A BOAT 
BUT THIS I'M AFRAID GOES AROUND CORNERS 
RATHER WELL 
SO DOES THIS MEAN THEY'VE TUNED IT 
SO THE HYDRO PNEUMATIC COMPLICATED SUSPENSION 
FOR CORNERING 
RATHER THAN COMFORT 
COS THAT REALLY WOULD BE THE FINAL NAIL IN ITS COFFIN 
WELL TO FIND OUT 
WE'VE DREAMED UP A RATHER UNUSUAL TEST 
FOR YEARS 
T. V. CAMERA CREWS COVERING HORSERACING EVENTS 
USED CITROENS 
THEY LOVED THE WAY THE OIL FILLED SUSPENSION PROVIDED SUCH A STABLE PLATFORM 
AS THEY TRACKED ALONG OVER ROUGH GROUND AT FORTY M. P. H. 
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE AT TOWCESTER RACES TODAY 
TO FIND OUT IF THE C. SIX CAN STILL CUT IT 
YOU SEE THE TWO THIRTY RACE TODAY WILL BE COVERED BY TWO CARS 
THE FIRST EIGHT FURLONGS FROM A CAMERA MOUNTED ON THE ROOF OF A C. SIX 
AND THE SECOND EIGHT FURLONGS FROM A CAMERA MOUNTED ON A B. M. W. FIVE SERIES 
THIS IS THE SURFACE THEY'LL BE DRIVING ON 
RUTTERED POTHOLED BROKEN 
RIGHT THE HORSES ARE READY 
THE BETS ARE PLACED THE PUNTERS ARE EAGER FOR THE OFF 
SO LET'S GO OVER NOW TO OUR COMMENTATOR JIM MCGRAW 
AS AN EXPERIMENT I'M THROWING AWAY THE BINOCULARS FOR THIS RACE 
AND RELYING ON PICTURES FROM THE CAMERA ON THE MOVING VEHICLE AND THEY'RE COMING IN AND THEY'RE OFF 
AND IN THE EARLIER STAGES ANDY GIN IS VYING FOR THE EARLY LEAD 
JUST BEHIND HIM BLACK THORN ON THE NEAR SIDE 
THEN FOLLOWED BY SIGNATURE TUNE AND HUNTING LODGE 
AND THE CITROEN'S SUSPENSION ABSORBING THE BUMPS NICELY THERE 
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLY SMOOTH 
AS THEY CONTINUE ON THE FAR SIDE 
STILL BLACK THORN MAKES THE RUNNING 
FROM UP THERE ON THE OUTSIDE AND ANDY GIN BEHIND 
AND BEHIND THEM IS SIGNATURE TUNE AND HUNTING LODGE 
IT'S LIKE DRIVING OVER SILK 
AND THAT'S A ROUGH OLD TRACK 
BUT THE CITROEN IS RIDING IT WELL 
TIME NOW TO HAND OVER TO THE B. M. W. SEE HOW IT GETS ON 
AND IT'S BLACK THORN WHO SHOWS OUT WITH A NOSEBAND BY A FEW LENGTHS 
SIGNATURE TUNE IS UP THERE THAT'S UM 
OH IT'S VERY BUMPY NOW 
IT'S ER YOU CAN SEE BETTER THAN I CAN 
LAST TIME THEY CAME INTO THE HOME STRAIGHT IT WAS BLACK THORN 
BUT ANDY GIN ON THE OUTSIDE 
I'D LOVE TO TELL YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING 
BUT I CAN'T 
LAST TIME I SAW IT IT WAS ANDY GIN IN FRONT BUT FRANKLY 
I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE WHO WON 
I DO IT WAS THE CITROEN 
OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOUR HAIR'S ON FIRE YOU NEED THE B. M. W. 
BUT FOR COMFORT THE C. SIX IS JUST UNCANNY 
HOLD IT HOLD IT 
LET ME GET THIS RIGHT YOU BUY THE CITROEN IF IT'S YOUR JOB TO COVER THE HORSE RACING 
BUT FOR ANYTHING ELSE HAVE A B. M. W. 
WHAT I'M SAYING IN ESSENCE IS IT'S NOT AS MAD AS I'D HOPED 
BUT IF YOU WANT COMFORT MORE THAN SPEED THIS IS THE CAR FOR YOU 
BUT ISN'T THE WORRY WITH A BIG CITROEN THAT YOU JUST LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY 
I RANG CITROEN AND ASKED THEM WHAT THEY'D DO TO STOP THAT 
AND THEY SAID HA WE WILL BUY BACK ANYBODY'S CITROEN C. SIX WHEN THEY'VE FINISHED WITH IT 
REALLY 
YEP GUARANTEED TO BUY IT BACK FOR HOW MUCH THEY WOULDN'T SAY 
IT COULD BE TWENTY FIVE P. 
IT COULD BE BUT THERE'S NO MORE COMFORTABLE WAY OF LOSING MONEY 
AND NOW WE MUST MOVE ON TO DO THE COOL WALL 
IT'S THE COOL WALL 
AND 
AND WE START WITH THE CITROEN C. SIX THE CAR JEREMY'S JUST REVIEWED 
ONE THING IT HAS IN ITS FAVOUR EXCLUSIVITY ABSOLUTELY 
YOU'LL BE LOOKING AROUND LET'S SEE WHO ELSE HAS GOT ONE OF THESE 
NO IT'S JUST ME AND THE GREAT THING IS EVERYONE WILL THINK YOU ARE AN ASSASSIN 
WHO'S THAT MAN YOU'LL HAVE TO NARROW THAT DOWN FOR US 
HE'S FRENCH THAT FRENCHMAN FOCUS THAT A BIT MORE MATE 
THE GUY WHO WAS IN RONIN AND LEON THE FILMS COOLEST MAN IN THE WORLD 
WHAT'S HIS NAME WHAT JEAN RENO 
JEAN RENO THAT'S ANNOYING COS IT'S RUINED MY ARGUMENT 
JEAN RENO WOULD HAVE A CITROEN I KNOW THAT SOUNDS WEIRD 
AND THAT MAKES IT VERGING IN FACT SUPER COOL CAR 
CAN WE MOVE ON AND TALK ABOUT THIS THE PEUGEOT TWO HUNDRED SEVEN 
FRENCH SMALL COOL 
NORMALLY YOU'D BE RIGHT BUT YOU'RE WRONG IT'S NOT WHAT 
IT'S NOT COOL ALL FRENCH SUPER MINIS ARE COOL 
APART FROM PEUGEOT WHO MAKE SOME OF THE LEAST COOL CARS IN THE WORLD WHO'S TUCKED HIS SHIRT IN ME WHY 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT COOL IS AT LEAST I CAN SEE WHERE TO TUCK IT IN 
WHOOO WHAT 
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LOW BLOW WELL A HIGH BLOW FOR ME 
I'M TEXTING KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS NO YOU'RE NOT I AM WHY 
BECAUSE SHE IS THE ARBITER OF ALL THESE THINGS AND SHE WILL TELL US WHETHER THIS IS COOL OR NOT 
IT ISN'T COOL HOW DO YOU TEXT 
SERIOUSLY SO SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD ON A FILM SET 
A GLAMOROUS ACTRESS WILL GET A TEXT FROM AN OLD MAN ON A CAR SHOW 
ASKING ABOUT A HATCHBACK PHONEBOOK GOD YOU'VE GOT HER NUMBER THERE 
HOW DRUNK WAS SHE WHEN SHE GAVE YOU THAT SHE WAS TIED UP ACTUALLY 
SEND 
HAVE YOU REALLY SENT THAT YES AND IF MY BOTTOM VIBRATES 
WITH A TEXT BACK I'LL MOVE IT DOWN BUT IT'S COOL NOW 
NO HANG ON A SECOND LET'S DO IT THE OTHER WAY 
MOVE IT UP IF SHE TEXTS YOU 
YEAH THANK YOU 
WHAT ABOUT THIS THE SKODA FABIA V. R. S. 
OOH WHAT ARE WE THINKING 
SERIOUSLY UNCOOL REALLY WHY'S THAT UGLY 
IT'S A SKODA IT'S A SKODA 
HE'S RIGHT HE'S GOT A MODERN HAIRCUT WHAT THE HELL'S HAPPENED TO YOU 
ARE YOU TREADING ON ONE OF THE CABLES 
WE'LL GET THE MAKE UP GIRLS AND SEE IF WE CAN GET THAT PUT BACK DOWN 
JESUS CHRIST WHAT THE HELL 
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON THE SKODA 
IT'S RUBBISH ISN'T IT SKODAS ARE ALWAYS IT'S HIDEOUS 
IT'S IT'S NOT HIDEOUS IT'S NOT A BAD LOOKING CAR 
DRIVE PAST A BAR FULL OF WOMEN AND NO ONE'S GONNA LOOK AT THAT 
DRIVE PAST A BAR FULL OF WOMEN AND NO ONE'S GONNA LOOK AT YOU IN THAT 
SHIRT IS WHAT SHE WAS SAYING 
ALL SKODAS ARE DEEPLY UNCOOL 
BASICALLY THEY'RE JUST VOLKSWAGENS FOR MEAN PEOPLE ARE WE RIGHT 
HANG ON HAVE YOU GOT YOUR TEXT 
NO 
BEAR WITH ME I THOUGHT IT'D VIBRATED 
NOW SAAB NINETY FIVE UNCOOL WHAT SAABS THEY'RE UNCOOL 
NO THEY'RE COOL THEY'RE BOUGHT BY PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY'RE BEING COOL AND THAT IS UNCOOL 
A SAAB IS JUST A VECTRA IN ONE OF THOSE FASHIONABLE SUITS WITH NO COLLAR MADE BY I. K. E. A. 
COS THEY'VE JUST RESTYLED IT FOR NEXT YEAR WANNA SEE WHAT THEY'VE DONE 
THEY'VE FITTED IT WITH DAME EDNA EVERAGE'S SPECTACLES 
HAVE THEY DONE THAT YEAH 
I SAW ONE OF THOSE AND THOUGHT SOMEBODY HAD DONE IT TO HIS OWN CAR 
IT'S AN UNCOOL CAR UNFORTUNATELY OOH 
COME ON THEN LET'S SEE FINALLY HAS SHE 
SHE HASN'T HAS SHE NO 
JEREMY JEREMY WHO 
I SHOULD'VE PUT JEREMY CLARKSON AT THE END OFF TOP GEAR YEAH 
BUT WE'VE GOT TEN TWELVE MINUTES LEFT 
THERE'S TIME COURSE MATE THERE'S TIME TO SAVE THE TWO HUNDRED SEVEN 
BUT NOW WE MUST MOVE ON 
YES A YEAR AGO HAMMOND AND I HAD A GAME OF CAR FOOTBALL 
IN TOYOTA AYGOS LIKE THIS ONE 
I LOST AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE END OF IT 
BUT NO BECAUSE WORLD CUP FEVER HAS GRIPPED THE NATION 
AND NOW THE AYGO HAS A CHALLENGER 
THIS IS THE GAUNTLET THROWER IN QUESTION 
IT'S CALLED THE VOLKSWAGEN FOX 
IT TAKES OVER FROM THE LUPO AS THE SMALLEST V. W. YOU CAN BUY 
AND THE FIRST PLUS POINT IS YOU GET MORE FOR YOUR MONEY 
IT'S BIGGER IN EVERY WAY THAN THE LUPO BUT IT'S CHEAPER 
THE BASIC TWELVE MODEL COSTS SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED 
ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED LESS THAN THE EQUIVALENT LUPO 
YOU CAN FEEL THE SPACE IN HERE 
I MEAN IT'S NO EARL'S COURT BUT IT IS GOOD FOR A CAR OF THIS SIZE 
SO GOOD WORK ON SPACE 
BUT AS FOR THE DASHBOARD OH DEAR 
IT MUST TAKE MORE WORK TO MAKE SOMETHING LOOK THIS BORING 
AND THE PLASTIC YOU KNOW THAT STUFF THAT HOLDS CHOCOLATES IN A BOX OF MILK TRAY YEAH 
THIS CAR HERE HAS THE SMALLEST ENGINE 
A TWELVE L. PETROL THAT DOES ZERO TO SIXTY IN SEVENTEEN SECONDS 
THAT IS PRETTY LEISURELY BUT DON'T THINK IT MEANS A DULL DRIVE 
IT'S GOT LOADS OF GRIP SO YOU CAN CHUCK IT AROUND 
AND IT RIDES REALLY WELL IT'S COMFORTABLE 
SO THERE WE ARE A DECENT WELL PRICED SMALL CAR 
BUT CRUCIALLY NOTHING IN ITS APPEARANCE TO SUGGEST 
IT CAN BEAT THE MIGHTY AYGO AT CAR FOOTBALL 
THE FACT IS THOUGH THE AYGO SHOULD BE WORRIED VERY WORRIED 
BECAUSE THAT MIGHT BE A V. W. BADGE ON THE FRONT 
BUT THAT IS NOT A GERMAN CAR OH NO 
IN FACT THE FOX IS FROM BRAZIL 
YES BRAZIL THE CURRENT WORLD CUP CHAMPIONS 
AND WINNERS OF THE TITLE FIVE TIMES 
IN SHORT THE BEST FOOTBALLERS ON THE PLANET 
SO LET'S SEE IF THEIR SKILL HAS RUBBED OFF ON THEIR CARS 
AND INDEED FIND OUT IF THEY'RE GOOD ENOUGH 
TO BEAT THE CURRENT TOP GEAR CHAMPIONS 
IN CONTRAST TO THE SHINY NEW FOXES 
THE AYGOS ARE SPORTING A FEW INJURIES FROM THEIR LAST MATCH 
SO I'LL CAPTAIN THE BRAZILIANS 
AND THE AYGOS WILL BE LED BY MY OLD RIVAL NOBBY MAY 
TOUGH ONE TO CALL BECAUSE THE FOXES ARE THE BIGGER PLAYERS 
I STILL THINK THAT THE AYGO IS THE MORE NIMBLE CAR 
THE FOOTBALL BORES WILL SAY THE JAPANESE HAVE NEVER BEEN VERY GOOD AT FOOTBALL 
BUT THEY'RE NOT JAPANESE COS THEY'RE MADE IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
MY ONE WORRY ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING IS THAT AFTER SEEING THIS 
PEOPLE WON'T BE BOTHERED ABOUT WATCHING THE REAL WORLD CUP 
CALL HEADS HEADS IT ISN'T TAILS BUT I'M GONNA LET YOU KICK OFF 
REALLY YES INTO THE WIND EXACTLY 
YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT FOOTBALL DO YOU LAST TIME WE PLAYED YOU CALLED HALFTIME THE INTERVAL 
JAMES AND I WERE IN THE OPPOSING NUMBER ONE CARS 
AND THE REST OF THE TEAMS FEATURES THE SAME MIX OF STUNT AND RACE DRIVERS FROM THE LAST MATCH 
THE PARCEL SHELF IN THIS IS MADE OUT OF PINEAPPLES 
DUNNO IF THAT'LL HELP 
WE'RE OFF IT'S A GAME OF FOOTBALL 
THE BRAZILIAN SKILL WAS IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS 
BUT THE AYGOS HADN'T LOST THEIR TOUCH 
FANTASTIC DRIBBLING BY MAY 
MAY'S ON FOR THE GOAL 
THE BRAZILIANS THOUGH WERE BIGGER AND TACKLED HARD 
YOU FOULED 
BUT EVENTUALLY THE AYGO AGILITY SHONE THROUGH 
THIS IS THE OLD FIRM IN ACTION WE'RE ALL OVER 'EM 
PASS TO NUMBER TWO HE'S FOUND THE GAP 
YES HA HAH 
NO WHAT A PLAYER FROM THE CZECH REPUBLIC THERE 
THAT MATE WAS A MAGNIFICENT CHOREOGRAPHED GOAL YES YES YES 
DON'T WORRY BRAZIL LET'S NOT BE DOWN HEARTED 
WE HAVE GOOD QUALITIES JUST SPEED OFF THE LINE ISN'T ONE OF THEM 
AND THE AYGOS TOOK FULL ADVANTAGE OF THIS FACT 
NICE BRINGING THE SCORE QUICKLY TO TWO TO ZERO 
YES 
IT'S SO CHUCKABLE IT'S LIKE HAVING A TRAIN WITH WHEELS ON IT 
WITH MY BRAZILIAN FOXES TWO TO ZERO DOWN AS THE INTERVAL APPROACHED 
TEMPERS STARTED TO GET FRAYED 
OOH 
OOH 
BUT WHEN THE HORN WENT THE SCORE WAS STILL TWO TO ZERO 
LEAVING THE AYGOS OVER THE MOON LOVELY WORK 
AND THE FOXES SICK AS PARROTS ETC ETC 
STILL THE INTERVAL WAS A GOOD TIME TO SEE HOW THE CARS WERE FARING 
HIS GEAR LEVER HAS COME OFF 
THAT'S A WORRY I SUPPOSE MAYBE IT'S BUILT DOWN TO A PRICE 
YOU RAMMED ME WHILE I WAS ON A RUN 
I DIDN'T ONCE AGAIN THAT WAS A SUPERB SLIDING TACKLE 
OH I'M SORRY I'LL JUST 
YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE LOOK THIS ONE ISN'T REALLY DEFORMED 
THESE AYGOS ARE TOUGH WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE A TOUGH LITTLE CAR BUT 
AHEM WELL THERE'S THAT BIT 
NOT ONLY WAS JAMES BOLSHIE 
HE WAS ALSO UNSPORTING 
O. I. YOU CHEATING GREAT 
THE SECOND HALF 
AND BOY DID MY FOXES HAVE A MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB 
LOVELY INTERCEPTION 
SUDDENLY THE HAND OF GOD INTERVENED 
AND THE HEAVENS OPENED 
THE WET PITCH STARTED TO FAVOUR THE HEAVIER TOUGHER BRAZILIANS 
GOOD WORK 
NUMBER TWO BRUSHED OFF THE AYGOS WITH A SCORCHING RUN 
FOXES ON A RUN 
YES MY FOXES WERE FINALLY INTO THEIR STRIDE 
THEY QUICKLY BANGED HOME THE EQUALISER 
NO 
YES 
AND THEN FOLLOWING AN AYGO FOUL 
OH THAT WAS A BIG CRASH 
WE WERE GIVEN A FREE KICK 
AND TOOK A THREE TO TWO LEAD NO 
WITH FULL TIME APPROACHING FAST THE GAME REALLY HOTTED UP 
OW THAT WAS DIRTY PLAY 
A FIGHT EVEN BROKE OUT 
WITH JAMES BEARING THE BRUNT 
OH DEAR 
THE SCRAP LEFT WAYNE MAY INJURED BROKEN ME METATARSAL 
AH THAT'S BETTER 
BUT THIS ONLY SPURRED THE AYGOS ON 
AND WITH JUST MINUTES TO GO 
THEY EQUALISED OH YES 
IT'S WORTHY OF THE ENGLAND NINETEEN SIXTY OH SHUT UP 
WE REALLY DO NEED TO PULL OUR FINGERS OUT 
THE SCORE NOW AT THREE TO THREE AND THE FINAL WHISTLE IMMINENT 
THE AGILE AYGOS WERE ALL OVER THE FOXES' GOALMOUTH 
NO 
OUR ONLY CHANCE WAS TO SMASH THEM OUT OF THE WAY 
IT WAS ME VERSUS AYGO FOUR DOWN THE WING 
I'D LOST THE BALL DAMN 
BUT NUMBER SIX CAME OUT OF NOWHERE 
YES 
OH NO 
ODIOUS LITTLE MAN WE ARE THE WINNERS 
I THINK I HONESTLY CAN'T SEE HOW ANYBODY'S GONNA BOTHER WATCHING THE REAL WORLD CUP AFTER THAT 
IT WAS JUST A BETTER SPECTACLE ABSOLUTELY THE REAL THING'S DULL 
I'VE GOT A TEXT 
FROM KRISTIN YES REALLY YES HERE IT IS 
GO ON THEN 
ER UM IT SAYS 
YOU KNOW ABOUT THE RESTRAINING ORDER 
THAT INCLUDES TEXTS I'M CALLING THE POLICE 
AND ON THAT BOMBSHELL IT'S TIME TO END 
SADLY FOR THE NEXT FIVE WEEKS WE WON'T BE HERE COS WE'RE MAKING WAY FOR WAYNE ROONEY'S EARS 
BUT WE'LL BE BACK IN JULY SO SEE YOU THEN THANKS FOR WATCHING
