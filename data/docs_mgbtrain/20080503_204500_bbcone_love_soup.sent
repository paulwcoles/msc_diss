THIS IS HOW IT ALWAYS STARTS 
ON THE BASIS OF WHAT THAT WE BOTH LIKE WHAT WE SEE 
COS THIS IS AN ARGUMENT I HAVE WITH MY TWO SISTERS ALL THE TIME 
THEY'RE ALWAYS SAYING A MAN CAN'T SEE PAST THE BODY 
AS FAR AS SEX IS CONCERNED IT'S ALL JUST ABOUT LOOKS AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERS 
WHICH I'VE ALWAYS NEVER BELIEVED YOU KNOW

TO FIND OUT HIS WIFE'S HAVING SEX WITH CUTLERY HARRY 
HOWEVER HOWEVER 
I WILL NOT SPEAK ILL OF THE DEAD BECAUSE FACE IT I'LL BE BACK WITH HER SOON ENOUGH 
TO SEND ME THERE WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE 
ALICE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE A RELIGIOUS PERSON 
OH WELL THAT'S A PRETTY BIG ONE ISN'T IT FOR THIS TIME OF NIGHT 
WELL I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING IF I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT THIS WAS ALL THERE IS 
THEN LIFE WOULD HAVE TO BE A PRETTY CRUEL JOKE WOULDN'T YOU SAY 
WELL YOU COULD CERTAINLY SEE IT THAT WAY 
SO WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOUR ALICE WOULD YOU 
SAY A SMALL PRAYER FOR ME TONIGHT 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO TO WHICHEVER WHATEVER 
JUST PUT A WORD IN FOR ME UPSTAIRS IT WOULD MEAN A GREAT DEAL 
ABSOLUTELY LARRY 
I WILL DO THAT WITH PLEASURE 
HIYA OH HI 
SORRY I'M LATE SOMEONE HAD A HEART ATTACK ON THE TUBE

THIRTY FIVE MINUTES STUCK AT PADDINGTON WHILE THEY FAFFED ABOUT DECIDING WHETHER TO MOVE HIM 
WHILE WE'RE ALL STUCK THERE LIKE LEMONS 
ANYWAY WHERE ARE WE GOING TO EAT WELL I BOOKED A TABLE FOR US 
AT THIS ITALIAN ROUND THE CORNER SO 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
RARELY IN THIS WORLD OF CHANCE AND ADVENTURE BUT MOSTLY MIS CHANCE AND MAINLY MIS ADVENTURE 
DO WE GET TO SEE FOR OURSELVES THE HAND OF GOD 
STEERING US SAFELY THROUGH OUR LIVES AND RESHAPING OUR DESTINY 
BUT TODAY WE'RE HERE TO GIVE THANKS FOR SUCH A MIRACLE 
TODAY THE WOMAN I LOVE HAS CONSENTED TO BECOME MY SECOND WIFE 
BUT MORE THAN THAT MUCH MORE LISTEN TO THIS 
YESTERDAY MORNING I WENT TO SEE THE CONSULTANT ABOUT THE LATEST TESTS ON MY LUNG 
MR. MADDISON HE SAYS YOU'D BETTER SIT DOWN 
I SAT DOWN I SAID GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT DOCTOR I'M PREGNANT WHAT IS IT 
HE SAYS WHAT CAN I TELL YOU 
WE'VE MADE A MISTAKE 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU 
HOW NICE 
WHAT THEY FOUND ON THE SCANS TURNS OUT TO BE SCAR TISSUE FROM AN OPERATION I HAD TWENTY YEARS AGO 
GASPS OF AMAZEMENT 
ALL THIS TIME THE DIAGNOSIS THE PROGNOSIS WELL WHAT DO YOU CARE 
WHAT DID I CARE TO GET SUCH NEWS 
I CAN'T TELL YOU 
AND SO TODAY MY DARLING MATILDA 
I GIVE YOU MY OWN MY VERY SPECIAL WEDDING PRESENT 
MY LIFE 
WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT THEN THAT WAS GREAT 
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT LITTLE SET TO WITH THE STAFF 
ONLY I THINK THERE'S AN ART TO PLACING A NAPKIN ON A LADY'S LAP THAT MAN HADN'T QUITE MASTERED 
NO ABSOLUTELY BUT I THINK YOUR LINE CERTAINLY MADE THE POINT 
WHAT ARE YOU A WAITER OR A GYNAECOLOGIST 
ANYWAY YOU GOT TIME TO COME IN FOR A COFFEE OR 
I'VE ACTUALLY GOT A MEETING AT FOUR IN FACT SO ERM 
WELL NEXT TIME PERHAPS YOU'LL GIVE ME A RING DEFINITELY O. K. THEN BYE 
WELL THERE YOU GO THEN 
LARRY LIVES WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE 
OH ISN'T THAT THE MOST FANTASTIC NEWS 
I'M JUST SO THRILLED FOR THE TWO OF YOU 
AND WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING FOR YOUR NEXT TRICK WELL I. I'M SORRY 
I DON'T THINK I QUITE SEE WHAT YOU'RE NO 
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T SEE WOULD YOU WHAT I SAW 
WHEN HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM 
I JUST SAW THIS SAD OLD MAN WHOSE LAST DAYS ON EARTH COULD BE MADE A BIT MORE BEARABLE JOYFUL EVEN 
BY A SIMPLE SELFLESS GESTURE ON MY PART FOR A FELLOW MEMBER OF MY FAITH 
WHAT ELSE WAS I GONNA DO AND NOW 
TWENTY YEARS OF THE JOKES AND THE STORIES 
AND ALL BECAUSE YOU HAD TO POKE YOUR NOSE IN 
I'M SORRY MATILDA YOU'VE REALLY LOST ME NOW WHAT DO YOU MEAN POKE MY NOSE IN 
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT DO WHAT HE SAID AND SAY A PRAYER FOR HIM THAT NIGHT 
WELL ACTUALLY IF YOU WANT TO KNOW I DID 
AND YOU'RE SURPRISED IT WAS ANSWERED 
AND SINCE WHEN AM I ALLOWED TO ASK DID YOU GET TO TALK TO OUR GOD 
YOU HAD NO BUSINESS PRAYING TO HIM FOR ANYTHING 
YOUR GOD OUR GOD YES 
OUR GOD TO WIT THE SACRED EXCLUSIVE COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM TRY OPENING A BIBLE SOME TIME 
LARRY O. K. HE WOULD HAVE DIED SOON BUT HE'D HAVE DIED HAPPY 
NOW HE'S GONNA LIVE UNHAPPILY EVER AFTER 
YOU SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH YOURSELF 
OH CHEERS ALLY I'VE BEEN READY FOR THIS I'VE GOT A MOUTH LIKE GANDHI'S SANDAL 
O. K. SO THEN WHAT THINGS WERE DESTINED TO HAPPEN YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY AND DID THEY 
HANG ON WHAT HAVE I MISSED IS THIS YOUR TENNIS COACH WHAT HAPPENED 
HIS TECHNIQUE OFF THE COURT LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED ACTUALLY NOT EXACTLY 
IT'S HIS TENNIS TECHNIQUE IN A WAY THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
THE FOREPLAY I'VE GOT NO QUARREL WITH THAT'S ALL FINE AND WELL UP TO SNUFF 
WHY DO THEY HAVE TO DO THAT ON EVERY STROKE 
BUT THEN LAST NIGHT I HAD THIS BRILLIANT IDEA DIDN'T I 
AS WE'RE SITTING THERE WATCHING BASIC INSTINCT 
I'M THINKING HOW ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF EROTIC RESTRAINT 
COULD NOT ONLY SPICE THINGS UP BUT ALSO WITH A WHACKING GREAT PIECE OF TAPE ACROSS THE MOUTH 
I MIGHT JUST GET A BIT OF PEACE FINALLY 
EXCEPT WHAT HE FOUND THE IDEA A BIT DISGUSTING 
OH NO THE IDEA OF IT HE WAS FINE WITH BUT 
SO THAT WAS THAT I'M AFRAID GAME SET AND MATCH 
I MEAN I'M SORRY BUT I CANNOT BE DOING WITH IT 
SO WHAT WITH THAT AND YOUR WEDDING IT WAS A BIT OF A CRAP WEEKEND 
AND WHAT ABOUT LAUGHING BOY YOU'VE NOT HAD ANY MORE VISITS OR PHONE CALLS 
I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID BUT 
THIS LAST WEEK OR SO JUST DRIFTING ABOUT THE PLACE LIKE HALF OF SOMEBODY 
DOESN'T HALF MAKE YOU THINK 
IT'S LIKE I'M STARTING TO WONDER NOW 
IF I MADE THE WRONG DECISION 
NO IT'S A VERY CRUEL WORLD WE LIVE IN SOMETIMES 
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK FOR THE GOOD IN IT 
SIX YEARS AGO NEXT MONTH I LOST MY BROTHER IN A ROAD ACCIDENT 
MY BIG BROTHER TONY 
BUT EVEN THOUGH I LOST HIM I KNOW HE'S NEVER REALLY LEFT ME YOU KNOW 
THAT HE'S STILL ALWAYS HERE LOOKING AFTER ME BECAUSE 
IT'S LIKE WHENEVER A MAN YOU KNOW WOULD HURT ME OR TREAT ME BADLY 
HE'D ALWAYS MAKE DAMN SURE THEY WISHED THEY HADN'T 
AND EVEN SINCE HE DIED THE NUMBER OF TIMES WHEN SOMEONE'S LET ME DOWN IT'S AMAZING 
ONE GUY THE NEXT DAY AFTER HE DUMPED ME A TREE FELL ON HIS HOUSE 
ANOTHER ONE WHO'D JUST BEEN STRINGING ME ALONG FOR WEEKS 
SUDDENLY CONTRACTED THIS REALLY UNPLEASANT SKIN DISEASE 
THAT KIND OF ATE AWAY AT HIS FACE IT WAS HORRIBLE SO 
AND GUESS WHAT YOU KNOW SEAN 
SAFARI SEAN WHO E. MAILED THAT HILARIOUS MESSAGE WITH THE LIONS 
I JUST HEARD TODAY HE WAS GORED BY A CHARGING RHINOCEROS 
SO NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME THAT'S A COINCIDENCE 
I DON'T THINK SO SO WOE BETIDE THE MAN WHO SPOILS YOUR DAY 
WHICH OF COURSE 
IS ONE THING YOU'LL NEVER DO 
OH SORRY D'YOU MIND COS IT MIGHT BE ERM 
HELLO DOUGLAS 
NO I WILL ABSOLUTELY 
O. K. THEN BYE 
PROBLEMS AT WORK 
OH RIGHT 
O. K. I'LL GET MY SHOES 
WELL NO 
I MEAN I SUPPOSE I'D BETTER JUST YOU KNOW SEE WHAT SHE WANTS 
YOU KNOW IN CASE ERM 
SO I SUPPOSE THAT WAS THE PERSONAL SECRET YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER DAY 
SORRY YOU SAID WOULD PROBABLY BLOW MY MIND ABOUT YOUR BROTHER 
OH NO NO THAT WASN'T IT AT ALL 
THOUGH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES DOUGLAS 
I DON'T KNOW TOMORROW AFTERNOON IF YOU WANT TO COME ROUND 
AND BE PREPARED WON'T YOU FOR A BIT OF A SHOCK 
DOUGLAS 
OH MY GOD 
WELL GOSH 
THAT WAS INDEED 
SO WHAT DO WE THINK THEN 
GIVE IT A BIT LONGER 
SEE HOW WE GET ON 
I WONDER HOW THEY'RE GETTING ON 
LARRY AND MATILDA 
I MEAN THE WAY SHE JUST LAID INTO ME THAT DAY 
WITH THIS BIG TERRITORIAL THING ABOUT KEEPING MY NOSE OUT OF HER RELIGION 
YOU JUST FEEL THEY'RE MISSING THE WHOLE METAPHYSICAL POINT SOMEHOW 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BOOK A PLACE IN THE AFTERLIFE ARGUING ABOUT 
WHAT HATS TO WEAR OR HOW TO COOK A HERRING ARE WE 
TO ME 
DIVINITY HAS GOT TO BE SO COMPLEX ONLY DIVINITY CAN EVER HOPE TO UNDERSTAND IT 
IT'S MY THEORY ANYWAY 
BUT YOU'VE RECOVERED AT ANY RATE FROM YOUR AMAZING EPISODE I KNOW 
I MEAN WHATEVER IT WAS I EXPECTED WHEN I WENT ROUND THERE 
I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT 
CERTAINLY EXPLAINED A FEW INCONSISTENCIES IN HER PERSONALITY EACH TIME WE MET 
COS SHE'D ALREADY TOLD ME ABOUT THIS DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH THE OTHER TWO 
THAT MEN CAN'T SEE PAST THE PHYSICAL SO WHY NOT PUT IT TO THE TEST 
AS DEVIOUS AND CYNICAL AN EXERCISE AS I'VE EVER COME ACROSS 
COS IT NEVER WORKS IN PRACTICE DOES IT 
UNLESS YOU'RE BOTH ON THE SAME PAGE 
WITH THE SAME PERSPECTIVES AND VALUES IN LIFE 
I DONE SUNG THIS SONG UNTIL I SWEAT 
AIN'T NOBODY BOUGHT NO ALLEY BOOGIE YET 
I'M WILD ABOUT MY BOOGIE 
ONLY THING I CRAVE 
I KEEP DOING MY ALLEY BOOGIE BEEN DOING MY BOOGIE ALL OF MY DAYS 
THEY BELIEVE A DEAD MAN'S SPIRIT CAN COME AFTER THEM FROM THE GRAVE 
IT'S ME YOU'RE TALKING TO GRACE IT'S ME 
SOMETHING HORRIBLE'S HAPPENED HERE 
AGH YOU ALL RIGHT 
BLOOD WAS FOUND ON A SHAWL THAT WAS AT THIS GRAVE O. K. 
HATRED DOESN'T BIND IT EATS AWAY IT DESTROYS LISTEN TO THIS 
SIR
