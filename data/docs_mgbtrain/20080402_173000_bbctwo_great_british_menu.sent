THE FIGHT GOES ON ON GREAT BRITISH MENU 
OUR TOP CHEFS ARE BATTLING FOR THE CHANCE TO PROVE THAT CUTTING EDGE 
BRITISH CUISINE IS AMONGST THE BEST IN THE WORLD 
THE WINNERS WILL PREPARE A FABULOUS FOUR COURSE MEAL AT THE TOP OF THE ICONIC GHERKIN IN CENTRAL LONDON 
HOSTING THAT MAGNIFICENT BANQUET WILL BE THE CULINARY TRAILBLAZER HESTON BLUMENTHAL 
AND THE GUEST LIST WILL BE BRIMMING WITH TOP CHEFS AND GOURMETS 
SO THE CHEFS ARE FACING THEIR TOUGHEST CHALLENGE YET 
GOING HEAD TO HEAD IN THIS WEEK'S HEAT TO REPRESENT THE CENTRAL REGION OF ENGLAND 
ARE SAT BAINS AND GLYNN PURNELL 
I STILL WANT TO GET THROUGH 
I STILL THINK THAT MY NEXT TWO DISHES ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO TAKE ME THROUGH 
I'M NOT GOING TO LET HIM WALK THE WALK I WANT TO GIVE HIM A RUN FOR HIS MONEY 
GLYNN PURNELL AND SAT BAINS ARE TWO OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST EXCITING AND INNOVATIVE CHEFS 
AND BOTH CONSIDER THEMSELVES AT THE FOREFRONT OF MODERN BRITISH COOKING 
THIS WEEK THEY'RE EACH CREATING THEIR OWN ORIGINAL FOUR COURSE MEAL 
DESIGNED TO SHOW CONTEMPORARY CUISINE AT ITS BEST 
AND EVERY DAY THEY'RE COOKING A DIFFERENT COURSE BEFORE PRESENTING 
THEIR FULL MENUS TO THE JUDGES AT THE END OF THE WEEK 
THEY AND THEY ALONE WILL DECIDE WHETHER IT'S SAT OR GLYNN 
WHO GOES ON TO REPRESENT THE CENTRAL REGION IN THE FINAL 
AND THESE TWO CHEFS ARE NOT ONLY THE BEST IN THEIR AREA BUT ALSO CLOSE FRIENDS 
SO THIS WEEK THERE'S ADDED SPICE AS IT NOW INVOLVES FOOD FRIENDSHIP AND RIVALRY 
SAT'S IDEA OF MODERN COOKING IS ALL ABOUT FLAVOUR 
SO FOR HIS STARTER COURSE ON MONDAY HE BROUGHT TOGETHER 
THE CONTRASTING TASTES AND TEXTURES 
OF QUAIL ASPARAGUS TRUFFLE CHEESE AND EGG YOLK 
AND GLYNN SHOWED SOME VERY MODERN WIT 
BY SERVING A RABBIT AND PEA TRIFLE 
IT HAD A TOFFEE AND RABBIT LOLLY ON THE SIDE 
YESTERDAY WAS THE FISH COURSE 
AND GLYNN EXPERIMENTED WITH JAPANESE NOODLES 
MADE FROM PIKE ENOKI MUSHROOMS 
AND SUMMER HERBS 
WHILE SAT SURFED AND TURFED WITH MONKFISH CHEEKS 
RATHER THAN THE USUAL TAIL BELLY PORK 
AND A SALAD OF NUTS AND SHOOTS 
AS YOU CAN SEE THE RULES HAVE BEEN CHANGED THIS YEAR 
TO ALLOW EVEN GREATER CREATIVITY THE CHEFS CAN NOW USE PRODUCE FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD 
AS LONG AS THE MAIN INGREDIENT IS BRITISH 
WHAT HAVE THEY COME UP WITH FOR THEIR MAIN COURSE 
MORNING CHEF 
I FEEL A LITTLE BIT INADEQUATE HERE 
I WAS ALL RIGHT TILL I'VE SEEN THE SIZE OF YOUR BOX 
I THINK YOU'RE PERFECTLY FORMED THERE 
SMALL BUT PERFECTLY FORMED THANK YOU 
SO WHAT WE GOT 
I'M COOKING VEAL FILLETS THAT'S LOVELY AIN'T IT YEAH 
WHICH I'M GOING TO ROLL IN A LIQUORICE CHARCOAL 
YEAH I THINK LIQUORICE IS HIT OR MISS 
I LOVE IT BUT SOME PEOPLE CAN'T STAND IT 
OOH AN EARLY DIG THERE FROM SAT 
SO GLYNN'S KEEN TO CHALLENGE THE JUDGES AGAIN 
AND IS ROLLING VEAL FILLETS IN LIQUORICE CHARCOAL 
AND THEN SERVING IT ON BLACK RICE 
WITH BOTH TAMARIND AND LIQUORICE PUREES 
HE'S THEN DRESSING THE DISH WITH SALSIFY 
GREEN BEANS AND ROCKET LEAVES 
IT'S CERTAINLY UNUSUAL BUT DOES GLYNN CONSIDER IT TYPICALLY BRITISH 
AGAIN IT'S A GREAT BRITISH MENU BUT TO USE INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCES IS WHAT MODERN BRITISH FOOD IS 
SO WHAT'S SAT UP TO 
I'VE GOT SOME LAMB 
IT'S FROM OUR BUTCHER IN NOTTINGHAM 
YOU CAN SEE THE COLOUR 
I'VE ALSO GOT SOME NECK I THINK IT'S UNDERRATED 
AND I'M GONNA COOK IT IN A PRESSURE COOKER 
YOU GET THE CONTRASTING MEATS TWO BITS OF LAMB 
I'VE DONE LOADS OF DIFFERENT VEG 
THE IDEA IS TO AUTOMATICALLY GET THAT KIND OF SUMMER ON A PLATE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS WEEK 
SAT SEEMS TO HAVE A LOT TO DO 
AS HE'S SERVING BOTH RUMP AND NECK OF LAMB 
WITH A SPICY ORANGE SYRUP 
ALONGSIDE ALL THAT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT OF GOATS' CHEESE 
AND A STACK OF DIFFERENT VEGETABLES 
WHICH HE'S SERVING RAW COOKED PUREED DRIED 
AND DEEP FRIED LOADS OF THEM 
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT FOOD IS YOU HAVE TO GIVE EACH ELEMENT 
THE SAME AMOUNT OF RESPECT AND TIME AND EFFORT 
AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL GIVE YOU THE REWARDS BACK 
SO FOR SAT GETTING THE BEST FLAVOUR FROM THE FOOD IS ALL ABOUT ATTENTION TO DETAIL 
TIME CONSUMING STUFF IT MAY BE BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY WORTH IT 
LAST YEAR SAT BAINS ACHIEVED 
THE ULTIMATE REWARD FOR HIS HAM EGG AND PEA STARTER 
TEN OUT OF TEN FROM ALL THREE JUDGES 
THIS YEAR HE'S AIMING TO BE CROWNED KING OF THE CHEFS AGAIN 
BORN IN DERBY SAT RUNS THE ONLY MICHELIN STARRED RESTAURANT IN NEARBY NOTTINGHAM 
AND HE KNOWS THAT ONE OF THE SECRETS OF SUCCESS WITH GOOD MODERN FOOD IS TO LISTEN TO YOUR SUPPLIERS 
YEARS AGO A CHEF WOULD RING A SUPPLIER AND SAY I WANT THIS THIS THIS 
AND THE GUY WOULD GO O. K. NOW WE SAY WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND 
WE NOW TAILOR OUR MENU AROUND OUR SUPPLIERS 
BUT SOMETIMES YOU CAN FIND QUALITY INGREDIENTS FROM THE MOST UNEXPECTED PEOPLE 
WE'VE GOT ASPARAGUS PEA SHOOTS BLACKBERRIES THAT WE'VE PICKED UP 
I THINK A NICE STORY IS MY VEG MAN HE'S OUR POSTMAN WE GET A LOT OF STUFF BY COURIER TO THE RESTAURANT 
A BOX HAD OPENED IT HAD HERBS IN FROM SCOTLAND 
HE SAID WOW I CAN DO THIS HE'S GOT AN ALLOTMENT 
NOW HE GROWS OUR HERBS FOR US AND THAT WAS TWO YEARS AGO 
SO NOW HE'S DEVELOPED SUCH A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WITH US 
WHERE HE'S GROWING BESPOKE VEGETABLES FOR OUR RESTAURANT 
CAN YOU GROW 'EM THAT SIZE 
I CAN GROW THEM THAT SIZE BUT MORE CYLINDRICAL 
SAT'S PASSION FOR THE BEST INGREDIENTS DOESN'T JUST STOP WITH FRUIT AND VEG 
HE ALSO COMPLETELY TRUSTS HIS LOCAL BUTCHER TO SUPPLY HIM WITH THE QUALITY MEATS HE NEEDS 
OUR BUTCHER HE'S A LEGEND 
HE'S PASSIONATE HIS PRODUCE IS THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD IT'S INCREDIBLE 
HE HAS DONE A LOT FOR NOTTINGHAM IN TERMS OF THE CULINARY MAP 
JUST AS WORKMEN NEED GOOD TOOLS CHEFS DEPEND TOTALLY ON THEIR 
INGREDIENTS TO SERVE THE BEST FOOD AND SATISFY THEIR CUSTOMERS 
I WANT THAT PROCEDURE TO HAVE A JOURNEY THAT IS FINISHED ON THE PLATE 
SO WE'RE MIDDLEMEN REALLY TO THESE BRILLIANT SUPPLIERS 
THAT'S THE STORY SOURCING IS THE KEY ELEMENT OF ANY CHEF 
I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR OBVIOUSLY I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR YEARS SAT 
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY ASKED YOU HOW DID YOU START COOKING 
I KIND OF FELL INTO COLLEGE ALL MY FRIENDS WERE GOING TO A LEVELS 
I GOT A PHONE CALL SAYING SAT ARE YOU COMING TO COLLEGE 
OBVIOUSLY CARRY ON HAVING A LAUGH ON THE SCHOOL AND I WENT YEAH TOO RIGHT 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NOTHING ACADEMIC 
SAW THE LINE WITH THE MOST GIRLS ON IT WAS COOKING 
I COULD HAVE BEEN A HAIRDRESSER D'YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
GLYNN'S QUITE DIFFERENT THOUGH HE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A CHEF 
JUST A SECOND GO TAKE THE EGG AND COME BACK 
TODAY GLYNN PURNELL IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE U. K.'S MOST EXCITING UP AND COMING CHEFS 
BORN IN BIRMINGHAM HE TRAINED AT SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP RESTAURANTS 
BEFORE RETURNING TO THE CITY TO WIN ONE OF ITS FIRST EVER MICHELIN STARS 
LAST YEAR HE OPENED HIS OWN RESTAURANT IN THE CENTRE MODESTLY CALLED PURNELL'S 
AND NOW HAS FREE REIN TO SERVE HIS OWN UNIQUE STYLE OF COOKING 
BECAUSE TO GLYNN FOOD'S ALL ABOUT FUN AND PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES 
PEOPLE HAVE SORT OF SUGGESTED THAT SOME OF MY COMBINATIONS ARE A LITTLE BIT 
WELL INTERESTING AND DIFFERENT 
CERTAIN COMBINATIONS ARE OBVIOUS 
LIKE THE CHEESE AND PINEAPPLE THE HADDOCK IN THE EGGS 
BUT ALSO WHY DO YOU PUT TAMARIND AND LIQUORICE TOGETHER 
AND SOMETIMES I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I JUST PUT THEM TOGETHER AND IF THEY WORK THEY WORK 
CORNFLAKES 
SALT CORNFLAKES GO 
YEP YOU'RE RIGHT HE DID SAY CORNFLAKES 
BUT LIKE ALL MICHELIN STARRED CHEFS HE HAD TO START SOMEWHERE 
GLYNN OFTEN RETURNS TO THE FIRST KITCHEN HE EVER EXPERIMENTED IN HIS MUM AND DAD'S 
GLYNN STILL HAPPILY COOKS HIS FIRST EVER SIGNATURE DISH FOR HIS SISTER GEMMA 
SOME OF THE SATURDAY MORNINGS SOMETIMES I HAD TO LOOK AFTER GEMMA 
SO WHAT WE'D DO IS WE'D HAVE A BIT OF A PLAY AND MESS ABOUT IN THE KITCHEN REALLY 
SO WE'D DO SPICED BAKED BEANS WITH A BIT OF CURRY POWDER AND SOME DRIED HERBS IN THERE 
THE END RESULT TASTED AWFUL BUT GETTING THAT END RESULT WAS BRILLIANT 
NO FANCY PRESENTATION 
THANK YOU 
I THINK THAT COULD HAVE DONE WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE CURRY POWDER 
SO EVEN AT HOME HE CAN'T ESCAPE THE FOOD CRITICS 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN SAT'S COOKING LAMB 
AND GLYNN'S COOKING VEAL 
BUT THEY BOTH NEED TO PREPARE THE DRESSINGS FIRST 
GLYNN'S MAKING A SHARP FRUITY SAUCE 
FROM TAMARIND TO GO WITH HIS VEAL AND LIQUORICE 
WHERE WAS THE IDEA FOR THE TAMARIND 
TO BE HONEST I ORDERED TAMARILLO 
AH RIGHT AND THEY'VE SENT THESE BY MISTAKE 
AND I THOUGHT WELL I CAN USE THAT 
IN THE END I LEARNT SOMETHING BY ORDERING THE WRONG THING 
YOU KNOW IT WAS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
SAT'S ALSO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW RULES ABOUT INGREDIENTS AND IS ACCOMPANYING HIS LOCAL LAMB 
WITH A SYRUP MADE FROM MOLASSES CITRUS RINDS 
AND FOUR DIFFERENT SPICES 
WHAT SPICES ARE YOU USING YOU'VE GOT QUITE A. 
THIS IS CUMIN GROUND CORIANDER SEED 
I'VE GOT SOME CINNAMON BARK A BIT OF STAR ANISE THE ZEST OF AN ORANGE AND LEMON 
AND I POUR SOME MOLASSES ON IT 
AND WHAT WE DO WE JUST KIND OF 
DRESS THE PLATE WITH IT REALLY 
SO YOU'VE GOT THIS LOVELY SPICED MOLASSES TASTE THIS 
IT'S STRONG YOU DON'T NEED A LOT 
SO THIS IS THE MOLASSES TREACLE 
AND YOU CAN TASTE ALL THESE LEVELS OF SPICE 
M. M. M. I'M GOING TO PAINT THE BOTTOM OF THE PLATE WITH THE THINNEST SMEAR 
AND PUT THE LAMB ON TOP SO YOU DON'T KNOW IT'S THERE 
BUT THERE'S THIS BURST OF OF FLAVOUR 
WITH THE SYRUP SIMMERING SAT CAN NOW CONCENTRATE ON PREPPING HIS LAMB 
HE'S USING BOTH RUMP AND NECK BUT FOCUSES FIRST ON THE RUMP AS IT WILL TAKE FAR LONGER TO COOK 
HE STARTS BY SEALING THE MEAT TO CREATE SOME STRONG FLAVOURS 
AFTER THIS HE'S GOING TO SOUS VIDE THE LAMB 
THIS MEANS THAT HE CAREFULLY VACUUM PACKS THE RUMP WITH SOME HERBS 
BEFORE POACHING IT AT EXACTLY FIFTY SEVEN DEGREES CENTIGRADE FOR TWO HOURS 
AND HE DOESN'T JUST TAKE THIS LEVEL OF CARE WITH HIS COOKING 
HE'S A STICKLER FOR QUALITY TOO 
SO HE WAS KEEN TO SEE WHERE HIS LOCAL BUTCHER GETS THE LAMB FROM 
LUCKILY FOR SAT HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TOO FAR IN FACT JUST A FEW 
MILES NORTH EAST OF NOTTINGHAM TO HOME FARM IN GONALSTON 
THERE FARMER ROGER JACKSON GROWS WHEAT AND BARLEY AND REARS CATTLE AND SHEEP 
HOW YOU DOING VERY WELL THANK YOU YOU 
I'M EXCITED TODAY GOOD 
I'VE COME TO SEE YOUR BEAUTIFUL LAMB COME TO SEE THE ANIMALS 
I'M DRESSED FOR THE OCCASION THAT'S RIGHT CITY SLICKING WELLIES 
SHALL WE ER CAN DO YEAH 
COME ON 
IT'S FEEDING TIME 
THE FLOCK IS MADE UP OF FIVE DIFFERENT BREEDS AS ROGER FEELS YOU GET BETTER QUALITY MEAT THAT WAY 
COME ON BOYS AND GIRLS 
YOU CAN TELL THEY'RE ENGLISH COS THEY'RE QUEUING 
THE QUALITY OF THEIR FOOD'S IMPORTANT TOO 
WHAT'S THE FEED ROGER 
I'M FEEDING THEM OATS JUMBO OATS 
YES JUST NICE OATS GROWN ON OUR FARM WE ROLL THEM OURSELVES 
THE GOODNESS IS IN THE GRASS AND THE OATS JUST BALANCE THE DIET FOR THEM 
WHAT'S FASCINATING IS COMING DOWN TO THE FARM 
IT'S NICE TO ACTUALLY SEE TRACEABILITY 
THE SOURCING COS YOU HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR IT THAT WAY 
YES I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT THE PEOPLE SEE HOW THE ANIMALS ARE REARED 
IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE WELFARE AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS PRESTIGE 
AND THE QUALITY THEY GET IS FANTASTIC 
AND YOU GUYS MAKE AN EXCELLENT JOB OF COOKING IT YEAH BRILLIANT 
NOW THAT HE'D SEEN THE FARM SAT COULD HEAD BACK TO NOTTINGHAM TO VISIT HIS FAVOURITE BUTCHER 
LAST YEAR JOHNNY PUSZTAI AT J. T. BEEDHAM'S SUPPLIED SAT WITH THE HAM FOR HIS WINNING STARTER COURSE 
JOHNNY HOW YOU DOING 
ALL RIGHT CAN HE DO IT AGAIN 
ALL MEAT INCLUDING LAMB BENEFITS FROM HANGING TO IMPROVE ITS FLAVOUR 
RIGHT I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN A FRESH ONE SAT 
THIS ONE'S PROBABLY BEEN KILLED FOUR OR FIVE DAYS 
AS YOU CAN SEE STILL VERY RED STILL VERY RED 
TOO SPONGY TEXTURE'S ALL WRONG 
A LOVELY PIECE OF LAMB BUT NOT FOR WHAT WE WANT 
SO WHAT'S THIS ONE HERE JOHNNY 
THIRTY DAYS OLD LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IT'S SOLID 
THE MAJORITY OF THE MOISTURE'S GONE 
THAT'S WHY IF YOU LOOK IT'S SHRUNK 
THAT WILL HAVE BEEN OF THE SAME SIZE 
ONE PER CENT A DAY MOISTURE IS WHAT YOU LOSE CAN WE HAVE A TASTE 
JOHNNY PUTS SLICES FROM BOTH JOINTS ON A HOT GRIDDLE AND SAT DECIDES WHEN THEY'RE READY 
I THINK THESE ARE PERFECT LET'S HAVE A TASTE 
IT'S LOOKING GOOD 
FIRST THEY TRY THE LAMB HUNG FOR FIVE DAYS 
IT'S NICE FLAVOURSOME NICE TEXTURE 
NOT BAD THEN BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ONE HUNG FOR THIRTY DAYS 
HUH BLOWS IT OUT THE WATER 
THERE'S NO COMPARISON 
YOUR MOUTH IS FULL OF LAMB 
D'YOU KNOW WHEN YOU EAT IT LIKE THIS 
I GET I TASTE THE PASTURE YEAH 
THAT'S A WINNER THAT'S THE ONE 
I THINK YOU'VE PULLED IT OUT OF THE BAG AGAIN AGAIN AS ALWAYS 
THANKS A LOT JOHNNY PLEASURE 
SO SAT'S DEFINITELY GOT THE INGREDIENT BUT LET'S SEE IF IT CAN GET HIM THROUGH TO THE FINAL 
STILL TO COME SAT VEG PREPS FOR ENGLAND 
GLYNN TRIES TO BURN DOWN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN 
AND BOTH CHEFS GET THE CHANCE TO TASTE AND COMMENT ON EACH OTHER'S DISHES 
BACK IN THE KITCHEN THE TWO CHEFS ARE COMPETING 
TO CREATE A MAIN COURSE THAT TRULY REFLECTS THEIR INDIVIDUAL STYLES 
BUT SHOULD ALSO IMPRESS THE JUDGES AND HOPEFULLY HESTON BLUMENTHAL AND HIS GUESTS AT THE GHERKIN 
GLYNN IS TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW RULE PERMITTING FOREIGN INGREDIENTS 
HE'S ROLLING VEAL FILLETS IN LIQUORICE CHARCOAL 
AND THEN SERVING IT ON BLACK RICE WITH TWO PUREES 
TAMARIND AND LIQUORICE 
HE'S THEN DRESSING THE PLATE WITH SALSIFY 
GREEN BEANS AND ROCKET LEAVES 
THERE'S A LOT OF CHEFS IN THE COMPETITION THAT WOULD PROBABLY GO MORE LAMB BEEF OR PORK EVEN 
I THOUGHT VEAL MIGHT MAKE A CHANGE 
VEAL IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE MEATS TO EAT SO IT'S PERSONAL PREFERENCE TOO 
WHILE SAT'S SERVING BOTH LAMB RUMP AND NECK 
WITH SPICY ORANGE SYRUP 
GOATS' CHEESE AND LOCAL VEGETABLES 
HE'S CONVINCED IT'S A WINNING DISH 
I AM A MODERN BRITISH CHEF SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT I REPRESENT 
GREAT BRITAIN AT THE BANQUET AT THE GHERKIN IT'S MY STYLE OF FOOD 
IT'S WHAT I DO 
SAT'S OBVIOUSLY FEELING CONFIDENT AND SEALS HIS SECOND PIECE OF LAMB 
THIS TIME IT'S THE NECK 
HE MAY LOVE THE SLOW COOKING METHODS OF THE WATER BATH 
BUT HE'S ALSO HAPPY TO SPEED THINGS UP WITH A PRESSURE COOKER 
AS LONG AS THE FLAVOUR'S RETAINED BOTH WAYS ARE O. K. WITH HIM 
AS SOON AS THE NECK OF LAMB'S READY IT'S REMOVED AND SAT SHREDS IT INTO A BOWL 
HE'S OBVIOUSLY PLEASED WITH THE RESULT 
CAN I JUST NICK A BIT OF THIS 
HAVE A TRY YEAH 
M. M. M. DELICIOUS INNIT IT JUST MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH YEAH 
AND AS THE CHEF THAT'S WHAT WE NEED OH YEAH 
SAT THEN ROLLS THE SHREDDED LAMB IN SOME CLINGFILM 
AND PUTS IT IN THE FRIDGE TO CHILL 
AS USUAL GLYNN'S MAKING LIFE COMPLICATED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN 
HE'S GOING TO COAT HIS VEAL IN LIQUORICE ASH 
TO GIVE IT AN INTERESTING BARBECUE FLAVOUR 
BUT FIRST HE NEEDS TO MAKE THE ASH BY BURNING STICKS OF LIQUORICE ROOT 
HEY IS THIS THE BONFIRE 
YEAH OBVIOUSLY DON'T TELL THE JUDGES BUT I'M USING A BIT OF ER 
NEWSPAPER IN THE BOTTOM SO I'M MAKING THEM LITERALLY EAT WORDS 
IS THAT THE MATTHEW FORT REVIEW 
SO BASICALLY I'M JUST GONNA 
STRIP THE LIQUORICE DOWN 
IT DOESN'T TASTE MUCH OF LIQUORICE ONCE YOU'VE BURNT IT 
AND THEN I MIX IT WITH A LIQUORICE POWDER 
TO RE EMPHASISE THE FLAVOUR 
TO BRING A BIT OF THAT LIQUORICE BACK WITHOUT IT TASTING TOO BURNT 
USING THE ASH FROM BURNT LIQUORICE STICKS COULD WELL BE 
THE SORT OF IMAGINATIVE RESPONSE THE JUDGES ARE LOOKING FOR IN THEIR CHALLENGING CHANGE TO THE RULES 
THE VEAL'S LOCAL BUT WHERE ON EARTH DO YOU GET LIQUORICE FROM 
SAMARKAND DISTANT OPHIR 
NO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES UP THE M. ONE IN YORKSHIRE 
HEAVILY DISGUISED WITH A CLOTH CAP SO THE NORTHERN CHEFS DON'T SPOT HIM GLYNN FIRST HEADED FOR 
PATELEY BRIDGE TO MEET KEITH TORDOFF AT THE OLDEST SWEET SHOP IN ENGLAND 
HE WAS AFTER SOME LIQUORICE ROOTS FOR HIS ASH 
SO WHAT I'LL DO I'LL TAKE A GOOD FIFTEEN STICKS OFF YER AND I SHALL SHAVE THEM DOWN AND USE THEM FOR MY BONFIRE 
RIGHT LOVELY YES I'LL GET YOU THOSE STICKS NOW 
AS WELL AS THE CHARCOAL GLYNN'S ALSO MAKING A PUREE OUT OF LIQUORICE PONTEFRACT CAKES 
COULD I TRY A CLASSIC PONTEFRACT CAKE COS THAT'S CLASSED AS A SWEET ISN'T IT 
YEAH A PONTEFRACT CAKE IS A SWEET ALTHOUGH YOU'D WONDER WHAT IT WAS BY THE NAME 
AND TRADITIONAL PONTEFRACT CAKE HAS TO HAVE THE STAMP OF PONTEFRACT CASTLE ON IT 
COS THAT'S WHERE LIQUORICE GENERALLY 
I CAN SEE THE CASTLE IN THERE THAT'S RIGHT 
DID THE CASTLE HAVE A LINK WITH ITS MAKING OR WAS IT JUST THE EMBLEM OF THAT TOWN 
NO VERY MUCH SO BECAUSE THE WHOLE GROUNDS OF THE CASTLE WERE TAKEN OVER BY GROWING LIQUORICE 
WITH HIS LIQUORICE IN HAND GLYNN HEADED TO ITS SPIRITUAL HOME PONTEFRACT 
HERE HE MET A MAN WHOSE FAMILY HAS BEEN IN THE LIQUORICE TRADE FOR CENTURIES TOM DICKSON 
HELLO GLYNN WELCOME HIYA TOM YOU ALL RIGHT 
NICE TO MEET YER CAN I TAKE A SEAT 
YES TAKE A SEAT BY ALL MEANS AYE 
SO WHY IS PONTEFRACT THE ONLY PLACE THAT THEY GROW LIQUORICE 
YOU CAN GROW LIQUORICE ANYWHERE GLYNN ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY 
BUT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GROW IT COMMERCIALLY 
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE DEPTH OF SOIL 
YOU MUST HAVE AT LEAST SEVEN TO TEN FOOT OF TOPSOIL FOR THE ROOTS TO GO DOWN 
LIQUORICE IS INDIGENOUS TO SOUTHERN EUROPE 
BUT IT WAS INTRODUCED HERE BY MONKS FOR ITS MEDICINAL QUALITIES 
IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SUGAR WAS ADDED AND IT SUDDENLY BECAME A POPULAR SWEET 
BY THE NINETEEN FORTIES PONTEFRACT FACTORIES WERE MAKING OVER FOUR HUNDRED TONNES A WEEK 
AND EXPORTING IT AROUND THE WORLD 
IT USED TO GO TO A REFINERY WHICH IS JUST A MILE AND A HALF UP THE ROAD 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALISE THAT THAT REFINERY WAS EVER THERE 
BECAUSE IT'S NOW A BATHROOM SHOWROOM 
AND WHAT THEY DID 
THEY PUT IT IN BIG PRESSES AND THEY PRESSED ALL THE JUICE OUT 
AND IT USED TO GO INTO BIG BATHS AND THEN IT SOLIDIFIED AND IT CAME OUT IN BLOCKS LIKE THIS 
AND THAT IS FIFTY TIMES SWEETER THAN SUGAR 
FIFTY TIMES SWEETER IT IS THE SWEETEST THING ON GOD'S EARTH 
AND THAT IS A BLOCK OF PURE LIQUORICE JUICE 
I WOULDN'T LET YOUR WIFE HEAR YOU SAY SWEETEST THING ON EARTH EH 
NO I WOULDN'T AYE MINE WOULD PROBABLY NO WE WON'T GO INTO THAT ONE 
SADLY TODAY THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF THE ORIGINAL TEN FACTORIES LEFT 
MAYBE GLYNN'S RECIPE WILL CAUSE AN UNEXPECTED REVIVAL 
MY LOVE FOR LIQUORICE AND THE REASON WHY I USE THE INGREDIENT 
IS THAT WE HAD IT AS KIDS A LOT 
SO TO ME IT'S A FOOD MEMORY AS WELL AS AN INGREDIENT I LIKE TO USE 
BUT WILL HE IMPRESS THE LORD OF LIQUORICE WITH HIS MAVERICK METHODS 
WELL I'VE SEEN LIQUORICE USED IN MANY WAYS BUT NEVER THIS 
YOU LIVE AND LEARN 
CAN YOU TASTE LIQUORICE IN IT 
A LITTLE BIT TRY SOME TOM 
VERY VERY VERY SUBTLE BUT IT'S MORE OF A CHARCOAL FLAVOUR 
YOU WANT MY HONEST OPINION YEAH 
ASHES OH DEAR 
NO TOM WHAT I'VE DONE IS I'VE USED THE ASHES 
AND MIXED IT WITH ANOTHER LIQUORICE POWDER 
RIGHT NOW IF YOU TRY THAT YOU CAN SEE WHERE I'M COMING FROM 
AH THAT'S WONDERFUL 
NOW IT'S GOT THERE THAT'S GOT A KICK ON YOUR TONGUE 
AT THE BACK YEAH SO WHAT I'VE DONE I'VE MIXED 
MY LIQUORICE POWDER AND THE CHARCOAL 
NOW TO MAKE A LIQUORICE BARBECUEY SORT OF ASH TASTE 
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL GLYNN WHEN YOU COOK IT SEND ME A PIECE UP 
I WILL 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN 
GLYNN'S MAKING THE CHARCOAL 
O. I. EE EASY TIGER ANYONE SEEN ME EYEBROW 
HE'S GOT THE FIRE GOING BUT HANG ON 
ISN'T THAT A PLASTIC BOARD UNDER THE HOT PAN 
IT'S STUCK TO THE BOARD YOU'RE JOKING NO WATCH 
GOOD JOB THAT'S NOT OUR KITCHEN EH TOO RIGHT 
I'M NOT LITERALLY TRYING TO SET THE WORLD ON FIRE JUST THE LIQUORICE I LIKE IT 
SO GLYNN SENSIBLY MOVES THE HOT PAN 
BUT I DON'T THINK HE REALISES HOW HOT IT REALLY IS 
I'VE BURNT THE BOARD AND NOW THE SIDE 
LOOK AT THIS 
THIS IS THE SECOND BOARD I'VE USED AND NOW LOOK AT IT MOVING 
IT'S LIKE TERMINATOR 
FINALLY GLYNN MANAGES TO BURN JUST THE LIQUORICE STICKS RATHER THAN THE WHOLE KITCHEN TO ASH 
UNBELIEVABLE I'M GOING TO GET A MASSIVE BILL AT THE END OF THIS 
WOULD WE DO THAT 
HE SIEVES THE ASHES AND THEN ADDS THEM TO SOME LIQUORICE POWDER 
THE VEAL FILLETS ARE THEN ROLLED AND COATED IN THE MIXTURE 
TO GIVE THEM A SUBTLE LIQUORICE BARBECUE FLAVOUR 
YEAH SO I JUST GOT THE MEAT SAT 
OH WOW I JUST LIKE BASICALLY JUST ROLLED IT IN 
COS OF THE THICKNESS OF THE MEAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TOO OVERPOWERING 
LIKE SAT GLYNN'S GOING TO SLOW COOK HIS FILLET SO HE BAGS 
AND VACUUM PACKS THE VEAL BEFORE PUTTING IT IN A WARM WATER BATH 
WITH THE MEAT COOKING IT'S TIME FOR THE JAPANESE BLACK RICE 
GLYNN LOVES COOKING WITH FOREIGN INGREDIENTS 
AS WELL AS BEING A COMPLEMENTARY COLOUR TO HIS LIQUORICE 
IT ALSO ADDS TEXTURE BUT WILL IT GIVE HIM THE EDGE OVER SAT 
SO THE BLACK RICE 
IT'S GLUTINOUS RICE IN'T IT YEAH YEAH AND WHY IS THAT 
JUST FOR THE TEXTURE 
I LIKE THE FLAVOUR OF IT A NUTTY FLAVOUR I'M GOING TO PUT SOME 
BALSAMIC IN IT TOO TO BRIDGE THE TAMARIND AND THE LIQUORICE TOGETHER 
AND ALSO I'M GOING TO FRY SOME BLACK RICE AS WELL JUST IN A LITTLE BIT OF OIL IN A PAN 
IT WILL JUST SLIGHTLY POP OPEN 
I GO ROUND THE SUPERMARKETS SOMETIMES IN BIRMINGHAM 
AND THEY'VE GOT CHINESE JAPANESE STUFF THAI STUFF INDIAN STUFF 
AND SOMETIMES I COME BACK WITH INGREDIENTS THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH 
AND I JUST THINK I'LL HAVE A GO 
I LIKE THAT IT STILL KEEPS YOU INTRIGUED DON'T IT YEAH 
SAT'S GOING TO ADD A VARIETY OF TEXTURES TO HIS LAMB DISH WITH A WHOLE RANGE OF VEGETABLES 
HE'S PREPARING THEM IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS 
GLYNN'S KEEN TO CONTINUE THE LIQUORICE THEME 
AND WANTS TO MAKE A PONTEFRACT CAKE PUREE TO COMPLETE HIS DISH 
SO WHAT IS PONTEFRACT CAKE 
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY CALL IT A CAKE IT'S LIKE A JELLY 
THERE'S A PICTURE OF THE CASTLE ON THERE SO IT'S SO ENGLISH 
THAT'S LOVELY IT'S NICE INNIT IT'S QUITE SOFT 
ONCE THE LIQUORICE CAKES HAVE MELTED GLYNN BLITZES IT INTO A PUREE 
IT'S ALL COMING TOGETHER NOW 
BOTH SAT AND GLYNN TAKE THEIR MEAT OUT OF THE WATER BATHS 
AND PAN ROAST THEM FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE SERVING 
SAT ALSO SLICES AND FRIES THE SHREDDED AND ROLLED LAMB'S NECK 
BOTH CHEFS ARE USING SALSIFY 
AND GLYNN'S DECIDED TO SHALLOW AND DEEP FRY HIS INTO CRISPY SLICES 
FINALLY SAT QUICKLY CARAMELISES SOME GOATS' CHEESE 
AND IT LOOKS AS IF HE'S FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE 
ME AND SAT HAVE BEEN MATES FOR A LONG TIME AND I WOULDN'T JEOPARDISE OUR FRIENDSHIP 
BUT HE KNOWS AS WELL AS I DO YOU WANT TO WIN AND YOU WANT TO GET THERE 
I WANT TO WIN I'M NOT GOING TO LIE I WANT TO GET TO THE FINAL 
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE I DIDN'T COME HERE TO BE SECOND 
FIRST SAT PAINTS ON THE SPICY ORANGE AND MOLASSES SYRUP 
THEN HE ADDS CAULIFLOWER PUREE 
AND SOME SLICES OF LAMB NECK 
GLYNN'S COOKED SOME GREEN BEANS WHICH CONTRAST WELL WITH THE BLACK RICE 
HE ADDS SOME CHEFFY TOUCHES NEXT 
WITH THE LIQUORICE PUREE 
AND THEN THE TAMARIND PUREE VERY PRETTY 
SAT'S LAMB RUMP LOOKS PERFECT 
AND ALL HE NEEDS TO DO NOW IS ADD THE VEG 
AND SOME MORE 
AND SOME MORE 
AND SOME MORE 
THE FINAL TOUCH IS A LITTLE LAMB JUS AND HE'S READY 
THE CHARCOAL COATING CERTAINLY GIVES GLYNN'S VEAL CONTRAST 
AND ALL HE NEEDS IS TO ADD THE SALSIFY 
AND SOME ROCKET LEAVES JOB DONE 
HOW LONG CHIEF READY MATE YOU YEAH 
LOVELY NICE 
LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU RECKON TOO RIGHT 
AND HE WILL VERY SOON 
SO HERE ARE THE CENTRAL REGION'S 
COMPETITION ENTRIES FOR THE MAIN COURSE 
SAT BAIN'S LAMB WITH MANY VEGETABLES 
AND GLYNN PURNELL'S LIQUORICE VEAL WITH BLACK RICE 
BUT ARE THEY AS GOOD AS THEY LOOK 
EACH CHEF WILL TASTE HIS OWN DISH 
WHILE THE OTHER CAN SAMPLE AND CRITICISE IT PRIVATELY 
FIRST UP IS SAT'S LAMB 
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON ON THERE 
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN 
I THINK BECAUSE I'VE GOT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN PRESENTATION 
THERE'S NO SET WAY 
IT'S ARTISTIC BUT IT STILL WANTS TO BE ALIVE YEAH 
WELL IT MAY BE ART BUT CAN IT BE MASS PRODUCED FOR A BANQUET 
IT LOOKS VERY SORT OF RANDOM 
BUT IT HAS BEEN PLACED THERE TO BUILD UP THE DISH 
IF THERE'S FIFTY GOING OUT AND SAT CAN'T DRESS ALL FIFTY 
THEN THERE COULD BE A SLIGHT ISSUE WITH THAT 
BUT WITH SO MANY INGREDIENTS 
IS IT A BIT TOO MUCH 
THERE'S A LOT OF BIG FLAVOURS ON THE PLATE 
HE'S GOT A LOT OF TEXTURES GOING ON 
SAT THINKS IT WORKS WELL 
IT'S ABOUT SUBTLETY IT'S ABOUT RESTRAINT AND BALANCE 
SO THE LAMB IS THE STAR OF THE SHOW 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU PUT LESS EFFORT IN THE REST 
BUT WHAT DOES GLYNN THINK ABOUT THE RATIO OF MEAT TO VEG 
I THINK BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE LAMB 
YOU COULD POSSIBLY LOSE ONE OR TWO VEGETABLES 
JUST SO THE LAMB SHINES A BIT MORE 
BECAUSE THAT'S THE MAIN PART OF THE DISH 
SO WHAT ELSE WOULD HE DO TO IMPROVE IT 
BIGGER PLATE SO YOU COULD SEE ALL THE INGREDIENTS MORE CLEARLY 
DOES SAT AGREE WITH HIM 
I THINK WE'LL CHANGE THE PLATE ON FRIDAY 
IT'S TOO CONFINED WITH THE BORDERS I'M TRYING TO GET 
A NICE BIG WHITE PLATE OR SOMETHING TO REALLY SHOW OFF THE VEGETABLES YEAH 
NOW IT'S SAT'S TURN TO TASTE GLYNN'S VEAL AND LIQUORICE 
WHAT DOES HE THINK 
IT'S A TYPICAL GLYNN PURNELL DISH YOU KNOW 
THIS IS WHAT I EXPECTED TO SEE 
I THINK THE KEY TO THIS DISH IS THE TASTE 
SO DOES HE THINK THAT THE CONTRASTING TASTES 
OF LIQUORICE AND VEAL WORK WELL TOGETHER 
GOOD COMBINATION YOU STILL TASTE THE VEAL 
THE LIQUORICE COMES THROUGH BUT IT'S NOT OVERPOWERING 
AND IS GLYNN HAPPY WITH HIS DISH 
I THINK WE NEED TO PUT A BIT MORE TAMARIND IN THE SAUCE 
HE LIKES TAMARIND AND HE MIGHT SAY THAT IT'S LIGHT ON TAMARIND FLAVOUR 
BUT IN FACT SAT THINKS THE TAMARIND COULD BE ONE INGREDIENT TOO MANY 
I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW IF YOU NEED THAT BECAUSE THE LIQUORICE HAS GOT THE FLAVOUR 
IT'S A CLASSIC CASE SOMETIMES US CHEFS WE DON'T KNOW WHEN TO JUST STOP 
OOH YOW 
BUT DOES THE DISH WORK FOR GLYNN 
THERE'S QUITE A CONTRAST OF DIFFERENT BITS AND PIECES 
BUT I FEEL THAT EACH ELEMENT DOES CONTRIBUTE ENOUGH TO THE DISH 
SO A FINAL COMMENT FROM SAT 
IT COMES ACROSS AS A BIT CONFUSING 
I DON'T KNOW I THINK HE COULD GET MARKED DOWN FOR IT 
WELL WE'LL HEAR WHAT THE JUDGES HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THEIR MAIN COURSES ON FRIDAY
