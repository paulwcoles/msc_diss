BIG BANG LIKE THE WHOLE BUS SHOCK

FACTORY GATE COULD MEAN HIGHER

AFGHANISTAN WE WILL BE LIVE IN 
KABUL KABUL LATER ON B. B. C. LON MORE DEATHS ON A 
MATERNITY WARD HOW SAFE ARE YOUR 
PERSONAL DETAILS THIRTEEN COUNCILS HAVE 
LOST FILES IN THE PAST YEAR 
GOOD AFTERNOON THE SURVIVORS OF A 
BUS CRASH IN ECUADOR WHICH LEFT 
FIVE BRITISH TOURISTS DEAD HAVE 
SPOKEN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THE 
VICTIMS HAVE ARRIVED BACK FOR 
MEDICAL TREATMENT THE 
INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING INTO THE 
INCIDENT WHICH HAPPENED AT JIPIJAPA 
THEY WERE PART OF A GROUP HEADING 
TO THE COAST TO CARRY OUT VOLUNTEER 
WORK WORK THE SURVIVORS OF THIS HORRIFIC 
CRASH ARRIVED BACK QUITO 
AMBULANCES ON HAND TO HELP THEM FOR 
MEDICAL TREATMENT NO GRAVE 
INJURIES HERE BUT THIS HAS BEEN A 
TRAUMATIC ORDEAL IT SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN THEIR INCA AND AMAZON VENTURE 
THE TRIP OF A LIFETIME IT ENDED IN 
TRAGEDY WHEN THEIR TOUR BUS WAS 
RIPPED APART BY A LORRY IT IS 
THOUGHT THE DRIVER FLED FROM THIS 
SCENE OF CARNAGE 
I WAS ASLEEP AS 
WERE MOST PEOPLE ON THE BUS L. JUST 
REMEMBER A BIG BANG THE WHOLE BUS 
SHOCK THEN EVERYTHING STOPPED 
REBECCA LOGIE FROM LON KASSHIRE WAS 
KILLED IN THE CRASH ELIZABETH 
PINCOCK WAS FROM SOMERSET EMILY 
SADLER WAS FROM HERTFORDSHIRE HER 
FAMILY SAY SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL 
BUBBLELY GIRL WITH HER WHOLE LIFE 
AHEAD OF HER INDIRA SWANN WAS THE 
FOURTH VICTIM THEY WERE ALL 
TEENAGERS 
OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE TEENAGERS THEY ARE LOOKED AFTER AND WE CAN 
GET THEM BACK ON THEIR WAY AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLEMENT 
THEY HAD COME HERE 
TO EXPERIENCE THE CULTURE LEARN 
THE LANGUAGE AND WORK ON VOLUNTARY 
PROJECTS THE ROADS HERE WERE 
DANGEROUS THEY WERE THOUGHT TO BE 
TRAVELLING ON WHAT IS THOUGHT TO BE 
THE SAFEST PART OF THEIR JOURN MI 
WHEN THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED THE 
TOUR GUIDE SARAH HOWARD WAS ALSO 
KILLED IN THE CRASH THE REMAINING 
STUDENTS WILL BE LOOKED AFTER HERE 
IN QUITO THEIR HOLIDAY CUT SHORT 
AND CLOSE FRIENDS LOST 
WE WILL GET MORE FROM ANDY IN A 
SECOND IN THE PAST FEW MINUTES THE 
HEAD TEACHERS WHERE ELIZABETH 
PINCOCK STUDIED HAS BEEN SPEAKING 
SHE WAS A LEADER SHE WASN'T AN 
ORDINARY STUDENT SHE WAS MORE THAN 
AN EXTRAORDINARY STUDENT IN FACT 
HER SPIRIT WAS INDOM MIT TABLE SHE 
WOULD NOT DUCK ANY CHALLENGE SHE 
WAS CHEERFUL EFFECTIVE WHEREVER 
SHE WENT SHE WAS THE SORT OF PUPIL 
YOU WANT PUPILS TO EMULATE SHE WAS 
AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU CAN GET OUT 
OF SCHOOL LIFE AND HOW YOU CAN 
BECOME SOMEBODY SPECIAL WE SEE A 
LOT OF NEGATIVE PRESS ABOUT YOUNG 
PEOPLE SHE WAS THE SORT WHO WOULD 
LEAD PEOPLE AND ACHIEVE REMARKABLE 
THINGS SHE HAD SO MANY OPTIONS 
SHE WAS WEIGHING UP BETWEEN DOING 
ENGLISH AND PHILOSOPHY OR ENGLISH 
AND SPORT SCIENCE AT TWO 
PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES IN THE 
COUNTRY IT WAS THE CASE SHE WOULD 
HAVE CHOSEN A PATH WAY SHE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN WANTED BY PEOPLE TO HEAD 
UP THEIR ORGANISATIONS AND TO 
ACHIEVE THE TASK THEY WOULD GIVE 
HER SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF 
LIVES PRIZED ASSETS FOR THAT WE 
ARE IN GREATER GRIEF SHE WAS A 
TREMENDOUS HUMAN BEING 
LET'S SPEAK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT TO 
GET THE LATEST ON THOSE WHO HAVE 
BEEN INJURED IN THAT CRASH WHAT 
NEWS ON THEM 
WELL THE SURVIVORS 
TOUCHED DOWN HERE IN QUITO LAST 
NIGHT THEY WERE MET ON THE TARMAC 
BY A FLEET OF AMBULANCES AND TAKEN 
TO HOSPITALS HERE MEDICAL STAFF 
SAY THEY ARE TAKEN CARE OF AND THEY 
WILL BE ABLE TO GO HOME AS SOON AS 
THEY ARE READY IT IS A FOGGY DAY 
HERE I CAN TELL YOU A HIGH LEVEL 
INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN LAUNCHED TO 
FIND OUT WHERE THIS LORRY DRIVER IS 
IT IS REPORTED HE FLED THE SCENE 
AFTER HE HIT THE BUS INSTANTLY 
KILLING THOSE FIVE PASSENGERS THAT 
IS THE LATEST HERE 
HERE THE COST 
OF THE GOODS IN OUR SHOPS LOOKS 
LIKE THEY ARE GOING UP MORE NEW 
FIGURES SHOW THE PRICE OF GOODS 
LEAVING FACTORIES HIT A SEVENTEEN YEAR 
HIGH THANKS TO HIGH INCREASES IN 
FUEL FOOD AND TOBACCO THAT MEANS 
THE RISE WILL GET PASSED ON TO 
SHOPPERS SHOPPERS THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE COST 
PRESSURES FACING MANUFACTURERS AND 
HOW THOSE FEED THROUGH THE SYSTEM 
TO WHAT WE PAY IN THE SHOPS THIS 
COMPANY HOPE TECHNOLOGY MAKE 
BICYCLE PARTS THE COST OF RAW 
MATERIALS ALUMINIUM AND STEEL HAVE 
DOUBLED NOW IT IS UNDER PRESSURE 
TO RAISE THE FINISHED PRODUCTS IT 
IS A SIMILAR STORY ACROSS THE 
ECONOMY AS GOODS ARE TRANSPORTED 
FROM FACTORYS TO WAREHOUSES AND 
RETAILERS TODAY'S FIGURES REVEAL 
BIG INCREASES FOR PRODUCER PRICES 
DOES THAT MEAN INFLATION NOW AT 
TWO POINT FIVE PER CENT WILL RISE WITH ALL OF US 
PAYING HIGHER PRICES 
THE PRICE OF 
THE GOODS THAT WE BUOY IN THE SHOPS 
WILL GO UP IT MEANS THAT THE COST 
OF TRANSPORT WILL INCREASE IT 
MEANS THAT THE INFLATION RATE THAT 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND TARGETS WILL GO 
UP 
THAT MEANS A BIG HEADACHE FOR UP THE BANK OF ENGLAND LAST WEEK IT 
CUT INTEREST RATES WITH THE ECONOMY 
NEEDING A LIFT BECAUSE OF THE 
EFFECTS OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH THE 
GOVERNOR KNOWS THAT IF INFLATION 
STAYS HIGH IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT 
TO BRING DOWN INTEREST RATES MUCH 
FURTHER FOOD IS PART OF THE 
PROBLEM GRAIN PRICES ARE SOARING 
BECAUSE GLOBAL SUPPLY IS STRUGGLING 
TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND THAT MEANS 
BAKERS AND OTHER FOOD MANUFACTURERS 
ARE CHARGING MORE FOR PRODUCTS 
THAT IS SHOWING UP ON PRODUCTS ON 
THE SHELVES IT IS NO FUN FOR 
SHOPPERS OR POLICY MAKERS L. 
HESITATE TO ASK ANOTHER NEGATIVE 
QUESTION HOW WORRYING 
IS THIS IT IT IS A NIGHTMARE FOR THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND THEIR JOB IS TO TARGET 
INFLATION KEEP IT TO THAT TWO PER CENT 
TARGET IT IS NOW AS I SAID THEY 
ARE RUNNING AT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT WE WILL GET 
NEW FIGURES OUT SHOWING IT COULD BE 
HIGHER THAN THAT MOVING ABOVE THE 
TARGET NOW YOU HAVE COST PRESSURES 
IF YOU LIKE WHICH WILL FEED FURTHER 
DOWN THE LINE SHOWING UP TODAY THE 
KEY QUESTION IS IF MANUFACTURERS 
ARE CHARGING MORE WILL RETAILERS 
THEN PASS IT ON TO CUSTOMERS IT IS 
POSSIBLE BECAUSE RETAILING IS 
FACING A COME TILGS AND A DOWN TURN 
THAT RETAILERS WILL TAKE IT ON THE 
CHIN AND WILL NOT NECESSARILY PASS 
IT ON TO US RETAILERS WOULD HIT IT 
GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO 
THEM IF THEY HAVE TO LAY STAFF OFF 
WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN TO 
INTEREST RATES AS A RESULT 
WE KNOW 
ABOUT THE CREDIT CRUNCH WE HAVE 
HEARD ABOUT THAT WE HAVE HEARD OF 
FALLING HOUSE PRICES MANY PEOPLE 
DESPERATE FOR ANOTHER CUT IN 
INTEREST RATES TO STOP SOME FORM OF 
SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY TURNING 
INTO POSSIBLE RECESSION YET WITH 
HIGH INFLATION IT IS VERY 
DIFFICULT FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
TO CARRY ON CUTTING INTEREST RATES 
TO HELP OUT THE ECONOMY IT HAS GOT 
TO FOCUS ON INFLATION IT HAS GOT 
TO KEEP THAT IN MIND IT WILL ONLY 
HOPE IT CAN GET THE BALANCING ACT 
RIGHT THE ECONOMY SLOWS DOWN A BIT 
THAT KEEPS INFLATION DOWN AND IT 
ENDS HAPPILY EVER AFTER A LOT 
THINKING IT WON'T 
THANK YOU 
IMPLICATIONS POLITICALLY THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAS TODAY SAID KEEPING THE 
ECONOMY ON TRACK IS THE LABOUR 
PARTY'S SOUL FOCUS HIS HANDLING OF 
THE FINANCIAL CISITS HAS COME UNDER 
SCRUTINY WITH A POLL SUGGESTING 
VOTERS ARE LOSING CONFIDENCE 
THEY MIGHT NOT LIKE TO ADMIT IT 
BUT DOWNING STREET MAY HAVE TO LOOK 
AT THE FACT IT IS NOT JUST THE 
ECONOMY WHICH IS CAUSING SOME SORT 
OF UNEASE HERE 
OF COURSE THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN HIT BY THE GOOD 
AND WORRYING ECONOMIC NEWS THERE 
IS DISCONTENT ABOUT POST OFFICE 
CLOSURES THE SCRAPPING OF THE TEN P. 
TAX RATE THEN YOU HAVE THE POLLS 
ONE YESTERDAY SUGGESTING THE TORIES 
HAD A SIXTEEN PER CENT LEAD THAT IS LARGER THAN 
OTHER POLLS ARE SAYING ANOTHER ONE 
WHICH SUGGESTS SIXTY EIGHT PER CENT OF PEOPLE DO NOT 
TRUST THIS GOVERNMENT TO GET US 
THROUGH THE BAD TIMES THAT IS 
WORRYING FOR DOWNING STREET THEY 
SAY JUDGE US AT THE END OF THIS 
NOT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT AT THE 
TORIES IN THE EARLY NINETIES THEY WERE 
TESTED THEY FAILED THAT TEST 
DOWNING STREET AND WHAT GORDON 
BROWN ARE SAYING IS THEY WILL PASS 
THAT TEST AND GET US THROUGH THIS 
BAD TIME 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW A SENIOR R. A. F. OFFICER HAS 
ADMITTED A HERK CLES TRANSPORT 
PLANE SHOT DOWN AT LOW ALTITUDE IN 
IRAQ THREE YEARS AGO WOULD NOT HAVE 
FLOWN SUCH A MISSION TODAY THE 
INQUEST RESUMED INTO TEN BRITISH 
SERVICEMEN WHO WERE ON BOARD 
THE INQUEST IS TRYING TO ANSWER 
THREE KEY QUESTIONS ONE IS WHY THE 
PLANE WAS FLYING SO LOW SECONDLY 
WHY THE CREW HAD NOT APPARENTLY 
BEEN TOLD THAT AMERICAN HELICOPTERS 
IN THAT SAME AREA HAD BEEN SHOT AT 
THAT VERY DAY AND THIRDLY WHETHER 
LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED HAD THE 
PLANE BEEN FITTED WITH SOMETHING 
CALLED EXPLOSIVE SUPPRESSANT FOAM 
IT WAS THE LARGEST SINGLE LOSS OF 
LIFE TO THE R. A. F. SINCE WORLD WAR TWO 
ARABIC TELEVISION SHOWED THE 
WRECKAGE OF THE HERK CLES IT HAD 
BEEN FLYING AT LOW LEVEL WHEN IT 
WAS SHOT AT AND THE FUEL TANK HIT 
THE INQUEST IN WILTSHIRE IS LOOKING 
AT WHETHER THESE MEN COULD HAVE 
SURVIVED HAD THE PLANE BEEN FITTED 
WITH A KEY SAFETY FEATURE 
SINCE THEY DIED BRITISH HERK CLES 
PLANES OPERATING IN IRAQ AND 
AFGHANISTAN HAVE BEEN FITTED WITH 
THE FIRM AMERICAN HERCULES HAVE 
HAD IT SINCE THE VIETNAM WAR 
BRITAIN HAS LAGGED BEHIND OTHER 
COUNTRIES IN EXAMINING FIRE AND 
SUPPRESSANT SYSTEMS BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
WHAT RESEARCH WAS BEING DONE WAS 
ESSENTIALLY FUNDED BY THE AMERICANS 
WELL THE SENIOR R. A. F. OFFICER GIVING 
EVIDENCE TODAY SAID BECAUSE OF THAT 
LACK OF RESEARCH HE WAS 
ESSENTIALLY IN THE DARK ABOUT HOW 
THE FOAM COULD HAVE PROTECTED 
PLANES HE ALSO SAID WITH HINT SITE 
HE PERSONALLY WOULD NOT HAVE 
APPROVED THAT PARTICULAR FLIGHT 
THERE HAVE BEEN MORE CASUALTIES 
AMONG BRITISH SERVICE PERSONNEL 
TWO R. A. F. PERSONNEL WERE KILLED AND 
TWO OTHERS INJURED THE MEN WERE 
CONDUCTED A ROUTINE PATROL TO THE 
WEST OF KANDAHAR OUR CORRESPONDENT 
IS IN KABUL FOR US WHAT HAPPENED 
WELL THIS WAS AL PATROL OUTSIDE 
KANDAHAR AIRFIELD IT IS A ROUTINE 
THING AS YOU SAID IN YOUR 
INTRODUCTION THE VEHICLE THE MEN 
WERE TRAVELLING IN WAS HIT BY A 
ROADSIDE BOMB THESE HAVE 
INCREASINGLY BECOME A DANGER IN 
KANDAHAR THEY RESULTED IN THE 
DEATHS OF TWO OF THOSE SERVICEMEN 
AND TWO OTHERS S. WERE INJURED 
FOUR TEACHERS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY 
ISLAMIST REBELS IN SOMALIA TWO 
WERE OF SOMALI ORIGIN THE OTHER 
TWO WERE KENOR THEY WERE WORKING 
IN AN ENGLISH SCHOOL IN THE CENTRE 
OF THE COUNTRY 
ITALIANS WILL FIND OUT WHETHER 
SILVIO BERLUSCONI HAS WON THE 
COUNTRY'S GENERAL ELECTION OR 
WHETHER HIS CENTRE LEFT RIVAL HAVE 
GAINED ENOUGH RESULTS TO OVERTURN 
OPINION POLLS THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
HAS ARIEED IN MARN THE 
AUTHORITIES HAVE PROMISED A PARTY 
ATMOSPHERE IN CONTRAST TO THE 
ANTI CHINESE PROTESTS WHICH TOOK 
PLACE IN LONDON PARIS AND 
SANFRANSIS SAN FRANCISCO THE 
JURY OF THE MEN ACCUSED OF PLANNING 
TO BLOW UP TRANSATLANTIC PLANES 
HAVE BEEN SHOWN ALLEGED SUICIDE 
VIDEOS ALL EIGHT MEN DENY THE 
CHARGES WHAT WAS IN THE VIDEOS 
WE 
WE HAVE WATCHED WE HAVE WATCHED AN 
HOUR OF SUICIDE DEOS OF FIVE OF 
THE MEN ON TRIAL THE FIRST WAS 
FROM IBRAHIM SAVANT FIFTEEN MINUTES 
LONG WHY HE TALKED ABOUT 
PARTICIPATING IN IT HE SAID I CAN 
NO LONGER BE DEAFENED BY THE 
SKREEPS OF INNOCENT MEN WOMEN AND 
CHILDREN TANVIR HUSSAIN A SEVEN 
HCH MINUTE VIDEO HE SAID HE WAS 
DOING IT TO REACH PARADISE FOR HIM 
AND HIS FAMILY HE SAID HE HAD 
DREAMT OF DOING THIS FOR MANY YEARS 
HE SAID DON'T MESS WITH THE 
MUSLIMS WE MOVED ON TO ABDULLAH 
AHMED ALI A SIXTEEN MINUTE VIDEO HE 
SAID HE WAS DOING THIS TO PUNISH 
THE UNBELIEVERS AND TEACH THEM 
LESSON THEY WILL NEVER FORGET HE 
SAID I AM FED UP WITH LIVING IN 
THIS WORLD HE SAID I WAS OVER THE 
MOON WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT I WAS 
CHOSEN FOR THIS BLESSED OPERATION 
THEN TO ANOTHER ONE WHO SAID AS 
YOU KILL YOU WILL BE KILLED AND AS 
YOU BOMB YOU WILL BE BOMB THEN A 
VIDEO FROM ARAFAT WAHEED KHAN WHO 
SAID GET OUT OF OUR LANDS OR ELSE 
THERE'LL BE MARTYRDOM OPERATIONS 
OUR TOP STORY TWELVE PEOPLE ARE STILL 
IN HOSPITAL AFTER SURVIVING DEEP 
BUS CRASH IN ECUADOR IN WHICH 
BRITONS DIED COMING UP VICTORY IN 
THE U. S. MASTERS FOR THE GOLFER WHO 
ALSO BEAT CANCER LATER ON B. B. C. 
LONDON WHY A LONDON COUNCIL WANTS 
TO MOVE ITS VICTORIAN LAMPOSTS AND 
REPLACE THEM WITH FAKES AND LUCKY 
BREAK FOR 
THE LONDON ACTRESS WHO IS OF A NEW 
MIKE LEIGH 
FILM 
ALL THAT 
AND THE 
WEATHER FORECAST 
COMING UP IN FIFTEEN MINUTES JAPAN SAYS 
IT IS STOPPING ITS CONTROVERSIAL 
WHALE HUNT IN THE ANTARCTIC BECAUSE 
OF THE PROTESTS WHICH HAVE 
DISRUPTED THE OPERATION FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN TWENTY YEARS THE WHALING 
FLEET FAILED TO MEET ITS OWN QUOTA 
THE CONSERVATION SOCIETY SAYS THAT 
CONTROVERSIAL TACTICS SAVE HUNDREDS 
OF WALES HERE IS CHRIS HOGG DRAMA 
UP ON THE HIGH SEAS 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS CAPTURE ON FILM 
THE MOMENT TWO OF THEIR GROUP 
BOUGHT A JAPANESE WHALING SHIP 
THEY SAY THEY ARE PROTESTERS JAPAN 
SAYS THEY ARE TERRORISTS THAT 
INCIDENT AND OTHER CLASHES CLEARLY 
HAD AN EFFECT THIS WINTER WHALING 
HAD TO BE ABANDONED DAY AFTER DAY 
A MONTH WAS LOST IN TOTAL THAT 
HURT JAPAN'S EFFORTS TO MEET ITS 
TOTAL FOR ITS SCIENTIFIC WHALE HUNT 
THE FLEET SET OUT TO CAPTURE THE PLANNED TO CATCH THE HUMPBACKS 
WAS SOON ABANDONED NOW JAPAN SAYS 
NO FIN WHALES WERE CAUGHT AND THE 
NUMBER OF MINKE WHALES COURT WERE 
FAR FEWER THAN PLANNED JAPAN 
DEFENCE DO RESEARCH FOR STUBBY MEAT 
IS SOLD TO HELP PAY THE COSTS OF 
THE FLEET RESEARCH THE JAPANESE 
TAXPAYER COULD BE ASKED TO FIND 
MORE MONEY THAT MIGHT NOT BE 
POPULAR THERE IS SAID TO BE A GLUT 
OF WILL MEET ON THE MARKET 
CAMPAIGNERS WILL SEE THIS AS A 
CHANCE TO REMIND PEOPLE THEY ARE 
PAYING TO PROP UP AN INDUSTRY WHICH 
OTHERWISE MIGHT STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE 
JOANA FISHER SPENT SIX WEEKS ON 
BOARD A SHIP CONSERVATIONISTS MUST 
BE DELIGHTED 
I THINK THEY ARE VERY 
PLEASED THIS IS A SMALL NUMBER OF 
WALES WHICH HAVE BEEN CAUGHT FOR 
THE CONSERVATIONISTS IT IS PROOF 
THAT THEIR TACTICS OF STAYING 
ALONGSIDE HIS WORKING WHENEVER 
THEY WERE WHIPPED THE JAPANESE 
WHALING FLEET ED BAIG DID NOT KILL 
WHALES WIS THEY DID NOT KILL 
WHALES EVERYONE AGREES THAT THIS 
DEBATE WILL BE WON AND LOST INSIDE 
JAPAN THERE IS A LOT OF FOCUS 
INSIDE JAPAN EATING THE MEAT IS 
NOT AS POPULAR AS IT ONCE WAS IT 
WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF THEY 
QUESTION WHETHER IT IS WORTH ALL 
THE AGGRO AS THEY ARE GETTING 
PERHAPS IT IS TIME TO QUESTION 
WHETHER THIS SHOULD BE CONTINUED 
THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE BARACK OBAMA HAS RUN 
INTO TROUBLE AFTER MAKING COMMENTS 
ABOUT THE AMERICAN WORKING CLASS 
HE SAID MANY PEOPLE CLUNG TO GUNS 
AND RELIGION BECAUSE THERE WERE 
BITTER THAT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS HIS 
RIVAL WAS QUICK TO SEIZE ON THE 
COMMENTS STILL ON THE CAMPAIGN 
TRAIL AND CAUGHT IN ONE OF THE KEY 
VOTING GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES 
THE DEEPLY RELIGIOUS MANY OF WHOM 
SAID THEY WOULD NEVER ELECTED AN 
ATHEIST HILARY CLINTON REITERATED 
HER BELIEVE THAT ABORTION SHOULD BE 
ALLOWED SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THE 
COMPANIES STRUGGLE WITH THE ISSUE 
SHE TURNED HER ATTENTION TO BARACK 
OBAMA CONDEMNING HER ARRIVAL AS 
ELITIST AND PATRONISING AFTER HE 
DESCRIBED THE STRUGGLING WORKING 
CLASS IS AS BITTER 
I THINK IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE CLEAR UP 
THAT WE BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE 
OF FAITH BECAUSE IT IS PART OF 
THEIR WHOLE BEING IT IS WHAT GIVES 
THEM MEANING IN LIFE THROUGH GOOD 
TIMES AND BAD TIMES 
SENATOR BARACK 
OBAMA'S LIFE HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH 
A HARD TIME RECENTLY 
I HAVE TO SAY 
THAT IN REPORTS SUBSEQUENTLY THERE 
HAS BEEN THIS NOTION THAT HE WAS BY 
FERRIS TENSE MY SPIRITUAL ADVISER 
OR MY SPIRITUAL MENTOR HE HAS BEEN 
MY PASTOR 
HILARY CLINTON HAS FELT 
THE GIFT OF GOD IN HER LIFE SHE 
HOPES THAT THE PEOPLE OF 
PENNSYLVANIA GIVE HER THE GIFT OF 
VICTORY A BRITISH JOURNALIST HE 
WAS KIDNAPPED IN THE IRAQI CITY OF 
BASRA TO MENSA GAME HAS BEEN FREED 
RICHARD BUTLER WAS ON ASSIGNMENT 
WITH C. B. S. HE WAS FOUND TODAY BY 
IRAQI FORCES AND IS SAID TO BE IN 
GOOD HEALTH A JUDGE'S RULING IS IT 
THAT WAY COULD MEAN THE WINNER OF 
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS 
ANNOUNCED LATER TODAY ZIMBABWE 
IT WILL DECIDE WHETHER THE 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION SHOULD DECLARE 
THE RESULT IMMEDIATELY THE B. B. C. IS 
ONE OF THE REPORTERS BANNED FROM 
REPORTING INSIDE ZIMBABWE IN ALL 
REALITY WILL A DECISION REALLY 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
VERY DOUBTFUL 
EVEN IF THE JUDGE RULES TODAY IN 
FAVOUR OF THE OPPOSITION PARTY AND 
ORDERS THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION TO 
RELEASE THE RESULT THE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL 
APPEAL AGAINST THE DECISION AGO TO 
THE NEXT STAGE THE COUNTRY'S 
SUPREME COURT IT IS UNLIKELY WE 
WILL SEE ACTION TODAY EVEN IF WE 
DID YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK WHAT 
DIFFERENCE IT WOULD MAKE ALMOST 
CERTAINLY IT WOULD BE THAT NO 
CANDIDATE WON AND OVERALL MAJORITY 
THE N. D. C. HAS SAID THEY WERE NOT TAKE 
PART IN A SECOND ROUND RUN OFF 
THEY THINK THEY WON THE ELECTION 
FIRST TIME ROUND THEY THINK 
PRESIDENT MUGABE IS PLANNING A 
CAMPAIGN WHICH WOULD BE VIOLENT 
TODAY'S RULING DOES NOT CHANGE THE 
SITUATION 
THE N. D. C. SAY THEY WILL SITUATION PURSUE A LEGAL FIGHT IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO SAY WHERE THIS WILL GO 
NEXT 
THERE IS A SECOND LEGAL FIGHT NEXT CONNECTED TO THE ONE THAT IS GOING 
TO BE RULED UPON TODAY THERE WAS A 
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION THE RULING 
PARTY HAS CHALLENGED TWENTY THREE OF THE 
RESULTS THEY WANT A RECOUNT THE 
ZANU P. F. SAY THEY WILL GO AHEAD WITH 
THE RECOUNT THE NEDC SAYS IT IS 
ILLEGAL M. D. C. WE WILL SEE THAT 
CHALLENGED TOMORROW
