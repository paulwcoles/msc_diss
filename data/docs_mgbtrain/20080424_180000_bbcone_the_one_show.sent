WELCOME TONIGHT OUR SCIENCE WOMAN 
SHINI SOMARATHINE IS HERE AND A MAN 
WHO HAS OCCASIONALLY DRESSED UP AS 
A WOMAN WHO COULD IT BE DON'T BE 
FRIGHTENED IT'S A TRULY HORRIFYING 
SIGHT YES IT'S HIM HE'S RATHER 
ODD BUT WE LOVE HIM LOVELY GYLES 
ALSO FROM FOOTBALLER'S WIFE TO 
COPPER'S WIFE ZOE LUCKER IS WITH US 
HIDING THE BUMP VERY WELL HOW ARE 
YOU FEELING 
FANTASTIC BRILLIANT 
YOU LOOK IT FEELING COMFORTABLE IN 
YOUR SKIN IS 
BETTER HAS BEEN DOGGING BLACK AND 
ASIAN WOMEN SINCE CLEOPATRA LUCY 
SIEGLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE TWO 
SHADES DARKER THAN SHE IS WONDERS 
WHY THEY DO IT 
THE QUEST FOR PERFECT SKIN HAS BEEN 
ON OUR AGENDA FOR GENERATIONS BUT 
IF TONING CLEANSING EXFOILATING 
AND PLUCKING AND DOWSING OURSELVES 
IN ANTI WRINKLE CREAM WASN'T ENOUGH 
IMAGINE IMAGINE SHUNNING THE FAKE 
TAN AND TRYING TO MAKE YOUR SKIN 
LIGHTER IT'S BEEN COMMON PRACTICE 
AMONG SOME OF BRITAIN'S ASIAN AND 
AFRO CARIBBEAN COMMUNITIES FOR 
YEARS BUT EVEN NOW HARLEY STREET 
IS JUMPING ON THE BANDWAGON IT'S 
EASY FOR ME TO SAY AS A PACEY WHITE 
GIRL BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE 
MOTIVATION IS 
IT'S THIS PERCEPTION 
OF BEAUTY AND HEALTH AND THAT 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO RESPOND TO YOU 
MUCH BETTER IF YOU ARE LIGHTER IT 
IS ALMOST LIKE A TAN ENVY IN 
LIGHTER SKINS AND A PALE SKIN ENVY 
IN DARKER SKINS 
IS THAT A SAFE WAY 
TO LIGHTEN SKIN 
WE HAVE THE 
TECHNOLOGY TO LIGHTEN SKIN WE CAN 
USE HOLISTIC SKIN LIGHTENERS TO 
BRIGHTEN AND LIGHTEN THE SKIN WE 
USE THINGS LIKE CERTAIN AS IS 
ACIDS WHICH SUPPRESSES THE 
OVERPRODUCTION OF THE PIGMENT 
FORMING CELLS 
WHAT DOES IT TELL US 
ABOUT SOCIETY 
I THINK THAT SOCIETY 
JUDGES PEOPLE DOESN'T IT PEOPLE 
DO HAVE WANTS AND NEEDS THEY WANT 
TO FULFILL THEM IN ORDER FOR THEM 
TO FUNCTION IN THEIR COMMUNITY MUCH 
BETTER 
BEAUTY AND LIGHT SKIN BETTER CLEARLY ARE NOT THE SAME THING BUT 
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS THE TWO HAVE 
BEEN ACQUAINTED CLEOPATRA IS SAID 
TO HAVE BATHED IN AS'S MILK AND 
MICHAEL JACKSON WAS CONDEMNED FOR 
ALLEGEDLY LIGHTENING HIS SKIN 
HOWEVER ILL LOGICAL IT IS A NOTION 
PERSISTS THAT PALER IS BETTER THE THE OLDER GENERATION THINK THAT LIGHT 
ERSKINE COME PLECTION IS BETTER 
THERE IS A THING ABOUT HAVING MIX 
RACE CHILDREN OR HAVE BETTER HAIR 
SO I THINK THAT THE OLDER 
GENERATION HAS PUT THIS IN OUR 
MINDS A STEREOTYPE THAT IF YOU ARE 
LIGHTER THEAN YOU ARE MORE 
SUCCESSFUL 
IN INDIA THE BRITISH SUCCESSFUL HAVE RULES SO IT WAS ALWAYS LIKE 
WHITER MORE BEAUTIFUL 
WHILE THE 
TREATMENTS I SAW ON HARLEY STREET 
WERE AT LEAST SUPERADVISED VISED 
BY A DOCTOR OVER IN SOUTHALL YOU 
CAN BUY THEM TO USE AT HOME I'VE 
BEEN SHOPPING L. HAVE A MOISTURISER 
AND A CREAM BUT ALL OF THEM HAVE 
ONE THING IN COMMON THE PROMISE 
OF LIGHT ERSKINE THE LOTIONS AND 
POTIONS I BOUGHT DIDN'T INCLUDE 
HARMFUL SUBSTANCES BUT THIS WOMAN 
ENDED UP WITH BURNT SKIN WHEN SHE 
USED A HOME PRODUCT CONTAINING A 
TYPE OF BLEACH SHE SAYS SHE HAS 
BEEN LEFT SO DAMAGED SHE DOESN'T 
WANT TO SHOW HER FACE 
I REMEMBER I 
COULDN'T EVEN GO OUT FOR ABOUT TWO 
WEEKS I STAYED IN DOORS BECAUSE I 
THOUGHT IT WOULD CLEAR BUT IT WAS 
GETTING WORSE AND WORSE 
THIS IS 
YOUR LOCKUP TRADING STANDARDS 
OFFICERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE 
BEEN STRUGGLING TO CURB THE SALE OF 
DANGEROUS SKIN LIGHTENING PRODUCTS 
FOR YEAR IS THIS FULL OF STUFF 
YES THESE ONES YOU SEE HERE ARE 
SKIN LIGHTENING CREAMS THAT WE 
SEIZED ON PROJECT LAST YEAR 
THESE HAVE ALL BEEN CONFISCATED 
YES AND THESE OVER HERE 
WHY IS IT 
SO DANGEROUS 
EFFECTIVELY IT CAN 
BURN PEOPLE'S SKIN 
IT IS CRAZY MA 
PEOPLE WOULD PUT THIS ON THEIR SKIN 
DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE KNEW WHAT 
WAS IN IT WHEN THEY WERE BUYING IT 
MAYBE NOT THERE ARE SOME LEGAL 
SKIN LIGHTENERS ON THE EUROPEAN 
MARKET BUT THESE ONES AREN'T AND 
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT PEOPLE WERE NOT 
AWARE THAT THESE HAD THE DANGEROUS 
INGREDIENT IN 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST A 
QUESTION OF TAKING HARMFUL PRODUCTS 
OFF THE SHELVES THE BEAUTY EDITOR 
OF A LEADING ASIAN MAGAZINE 
BELIEVES WOMEN WHO KEEP WILL KEEP 
PUTTING THEMSELVES AT RISK UNTIL 
TRADITIONAL IDEAS ARE ROBUSTLY 
CHALLENGED 
I GET GIRLS WRITING TO CHALLENGED ME AS YOUNG AS FIFTEEN WHO WANT TO 
CHANGE THEIR SKIN TONE AND I 
ENCOURAGE THEM TO EMBRACE THEIR 
NATURAL BEAUTY AND WORK WITH IT 
WHY DO WOMEN WANT TO LIGHTEN THEIR 
SKIN 
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT SKIN GOES BACK DECADES WHERE IN INDIA 
AND IN AFRICA A LARGE MAJORITY OF 
THE POPULATION THOUGHT THAT BEING 
FAIRER IN COME COME PLECK SHUN 
WOULD WORK TO THEIR ADVANTAGE IN 
TERMS OF FINDING A SUITABLE JOB OR 
PARTNER 
WHY ARE THEY STILL DOING PARTNER IT 
I THINK THINGS ARE GETTING IT BETTER THERE ARE A LOT MORE BLACK 
MODELS AROUND EVEN IN INDIA THE 
BOLLYWOOD ACTRESSS ARE EMERGING 
WITH DUSKIER SKIN AND EVEN IN 
AINDIA FASHION WEEK YOU WOULD SEE 
DARKER SKINS 
THIS BROAD IDEA OF 
BEAUTY MAY BE GAINING GROUND BUT 
AS LONG AS SOME OF US ARE UNHAPPY 
THERE WILL BE SOMEONE HAPPY TO SEE 
THE COLOUR OF OUR MONEY L. FIND 
THAT REALLY QUITE DISTURBING HAVE 
YOU COME ACROSS THIS YOURSELF WHAT WHAT I HAVE DONE ASIAN FASHION SHOWS FOR 
INDIAN DESIGNERS THEY HAVE BROUGHT 
MODELS FROM INDIA TO LONDON A LOT 
A LOT OF THE GIRLS ARE USING THIS 
CREAM TO LIGHTEN SKIN AND CONTACT 
LENSS BLUE AND GREENS JUST TO 
LOOK MORE EUROPEAN 
WERE YOU NOT 
SHOCKED BY THAT 
I WAS THEY LOOKED 
AT ME AND 
I WAS TERMED DUSKY I AM 
IMPRESSED WHO HAS DONE MODELLING 
AND WHO HAS A DOCT RATE IN 
ENGINEERING 
IT WAS A WHILE AGO ENGINEERING WHY DO THEY DO IT IT IS ONE HUNDRED 
MILLION THIS INDUSTRY IS WORTH IN 
INDIA IT SEEMS BARKING MAD IT'S IT'S CRAZY IT'S TO DO WITH THE CAST 
SYSTEM THE LIGHTER YOU ARE THE 
HIGHER THE SOCIAL RANKING YOU HAVE 
THAT IS THE REALITY 
WHAT DO YOU 
MAKE OF IT ALL 
I MEAN IT IS QUITE 
DISTURBING WHEN YOU SEE THE LADIES 
ON THE FILM AND IT'S AWFUL TO THINK 
THAT PEOPLE HAVE GOT SUCH LOW SELF 
ESTEEM THAT THEY WILL GO TO THE 
MEASURES TO KIND OF DO ANYTHING TO 
BECOME WHAT THEY THINK IS MORE 
ACCEPTABLE 
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF ACCEPTABLE US AS LUCY SAID OR DESCRIBED 
HERSELF AS BEEN THE PASTEY WHITE 
GIRL WE ARE GOING TO SUNBEDS WHEN WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN I GOT A SUNBED FOR MY 
BIRTHDAY AND I USED TO LIE UNDER IT 
FOR AN HOUR TO GO DARKER 
THAT WAS 
WHEN YOU WERE SEVENTEEN THAT IS MORE 
RECENT LOOK AT THAT 
I THINK YOU 
MIGHT HAVE ORANGED THAT UP A SLIGHT 
BIT 
THAT IS A SCANDALOUS BIT ACCUSATION B. B. C. TRUST AND 
EVERYTHING WE WOULD NEVER DARE DO 
SUCH A THING CHRISTINE SHE TURNS 
INTO A CHOCK ICE LOOK AT THE 
COLOUR OF THAT IS THAT GRAVY 
BROWNING 
NO I WAS IN THE SUN L. BROWNING USED TO GET TEASED FOR BEING SO 
DARK 
GYLES WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON DARK THIS 
IT'S 
LIKE YOURS WE WOULD THIS LIKE TO BE DARKER WE DO IT TO BE 
HUNCHES IT IS RATHER AS I WAS IN 
WALES DISCOVERING THAT EVERYONE IN 
WALES NOW WANTS TO BE MIDDLE CLASS 
WE ALL WANT TO MEET IN THE MIDDLE 
DARKER PEOPLE WANT TO BE LIGHTER 
AND LIGHTER PEOPLE WANT TO BE 
DARKER WE ALL WANT TO BE BEIGE WE WE WILL WHEN WE HAVE INTER BRED ALL 
OVER THE WORLD 
THE BENEFITS OF 
GLOBAL WARMING WE ALL WE WILL 
ALL BE TANNED ONE WORLD AT LOOST 
LAST AND IT IS ALL BEIGE 
ZOE IS 
LOOKING AT US L. DON'T WANT TO BE 
BEIGE ONE HUNDREDS YEARS AGO THE 
WIND IN THE WILLOWS WAS WRITTEN AND 
IT SOLD TWENTY FIVE MILLION COPIES IN SEVEN 
ZERO Q. U. U. N. S. AND MADE INTO T. V. FILM AND 
STAGE SHOWS BUT WHERE DID THE 
STORY START THE ANSWER IS JUST UP 
THE RIVER HERE IN BERKSHIRE SEVENTY 
COUNTRIES HE FELT THE BOAT SWAY 
LIGHTLY UNDER HIM IT'S THE ONLY 
THING SAID THE WATER RAT BELIEVE 
ME MY YOUNG FRIEND THERE IS 
NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HALF 
SO MUCH WORTH DOING AS SIMPLY 
MESSING ABOUT IN BOATS L. LOVE THIS 
BOOK IT'S FULL OF WONDERFUL CRACKS 
RATTY MOLE BADGER AND MR. TOAD 
CHARACTERS IT IS OF COURSE THE 
WIND IN THE WILLOWS AUTHOR KENNETH 
GRAHAME WAS INSPIRED BY HIS 
CHILDHOOD AROUND THE BANKS OF THE 
RIVER THAMES IN THE BERKSHIRE 
VILLAGE OF COOKHAM THE BOOK 
CELEBRATES ITS CENTENARY THIS YEAR 
BUT STARTED OUT AS BED TIME STORIES 
TOLD BY GRAHAM TO HIS SON IN THIS 
VERY HOUSE TODAY IT SERVES AS A 
SCHOOL AND I'VE COME HERE TO FIND 
OUT MORE FROM AN EXPERT COOKHAM IS 
AT THE HEART OF WIND IN THE WILLOWS 
IT IS REALLY IT 
WAS PLACE THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO KENNETH 
GRAHAME WHO CAME HERE AS VERY 
YOUNG CHILD AGED FIVE HE SEEMS TO 
HAVE COMPLETELY IMMERSED HIMSELF IN 
NATURE AND RUN WILD IN THE GARDENS 
AND COUNTRYSIDE AND ABSOLUTELY 
COMES TO LOVE COOKHAM AND THE AREA 
AND THE RIVER 
THE RIVERBANK IS 
NEAR HERE IS THE WILD WOOD HERE 
HERE AS WELL 
THERE IS QUARRY WOOD 
NEAR MARLOW L. L. THINK THAT 
DEFINITELY WAS AN INSPIRATION TO 
HIM IT'S A BIT OF A SCAREY PLACE 
FOR HIM THE RIVERBANK IS A PLACE 
OF IDEAS 
IN THE WILD WOOD OF 
COURSE THERE ARE WEASELS 
AND STOTS 
AND IT'S REALLY FIERCESOME AND I 
THINK IT IS A PLACE WHERE HE 
DOESN'T FEEL AT ALL SECURE THE THE WILD WOOD LAY BEFORE HIM LOW AND 
THREATENING TREES CROUCHED NEARER 
AND NEARER HE THOUGHT HE SAW A 
FACE A LITTLE EVIL WEDGE SHAPED 
FACE WHEN HE TURNED AND CONFRONTED 
IT THE THING HAD VANISHED GRAHAM'S 
LOCATIONS AND CHARACTERS WERE MADE 
ALL THE MORE REAL BY HIS 
COLLABORATION WITH ILLUSTRATOR EH 
SHEPHERD GIVING THE NOW FAMOUS 
LIKENESSES OF MOLE RATTY AND THE 
REST AND THE RIVERBANK'S GRANDEST 
ADDRESS TOAD HALL WHEN THE ARTIST 
WANTED A MODEL FOR HIS ILLUSTRATION 
OF TOAD HALL GRAHAM DIRECTED HIM 
DOWN HERE TO THE BANKS OF THE RIVER 
AND WAITING FOR HIM HERE WAS MAPLE 
DURHAM HOUSE A SHORT TRIP UP RIVER 
FROM COOKHAM JUST LIKE TOAD HALL 
THIS SEVENTEENTH CENTURY MANSION IS A RED 
BRICK HOUSE WITH A WHITE PORTICO 
EVEN TODAY YOU CAN FIND THE SPOT 
WHERE ONCE REAL LIFE FRIENDS WOULD 
ARRIVE HERE BY BOAT ROUNDING A 
BEND IN THE RIVER THEY CAME IN 
SIGHT OF A HANDSOME DIGNIFIED OLD 
HOUSE OF MELLOWED RED BRICK WITH 
WELL KEPT LAWNS REACHING DOWN TO 
THE WATER'S EDGE THERE IS TOAD 
HALL SAID THE RAT ONE OF THE 
NICEST HOUSES IN THESE PARTS 
THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER ADMIT AS MUCH 
TO TO TOAD THERE IS SOMEONE 
MISSING IF THIS IS TOAD HALL MR. 
TOAD IS MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER 
HE'S THE ONE EVERYBODY REMEMBERS 
LORD OF THE MANNOR LARGER THAN 
LIFE LOVERABLE AND ILL POSSIBLE 
AND ALWAYS GETTING INTO SCRAPES A 
CREATURE COMPLETELY OBSESSED WITH 
HIS MOTOR CAR THE OLD FASHIONED 
PASSION SEIZED ON TOAD AND MASTERED 
HIM BODY AND SOUL AND INCREASED HIS 
PACE AND AS THE CAR DEVOURED THE 
STREET HE WAS ONLY CONSCIOUS HE WAS 
TOAD ONCE MORE IN COOKHAM TODAY 
CARS HAVE BECOME COMMON PLACE BUT 
IT WAS IN KENNETH GRAHAME'S TIME 
THAT THE FIRST CAR CAME TO THE 
VILLAGE IT WAS OWNED BY A GREAT 
UNCLE OF THIS LOCAL MAN AND HE 
THINKS IT WAS THIS HAS INSPIRED THE 
INFAMOUS MR. TOAD THE COLONEL COULD 
BE THE ORIGINAL MR. TOAD 
WELL THAT 
IS TRUE BECAUSE LOCAL FOLKLORE SAY 
THAT HE DEFINITELY WAS AND HE HAD A 
VERY BRIGHT YELLOW ROLLS ROYCE L. 
BELIEVE IT WAS THE ONLY CAR IN THE 
VILLAGE 
COULD THIS BE THE VEHICLE VILLAGE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
I THINK THAT 
IS A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THE ACTUAL 
CAR WAS LIKE IT CAUSED GREAT 
EXCITEMENT IN THE VILLAGE THE THE POINT IS THAT THE COLONEL WAS A 
GREAT COOKHAM CHARACTER KNOWN TO 
KETH ENERGY GRAHAM 
HE WAS AN 
EXTROVERT AND OVER THE TOP BUT AT 
THE END OF THE DAY THEY REALLY 
RATHER LOVED HIM 
I THINK WHAT WE 
ARE SAYING IS WE HAVE FOUND THE 
ORIGINAL MR. TOAD 
I HOPE SO YES 
POOP POOP 
EXCELLENT WORK GYLES 
IT'S A 
WONDERFUL BOOK ONE OF MY 
FAVOURITES IT IS STUFFED FULL OF 
QUOTATIONS THATIC YOUR EYES WATER

HOLIDAY IS PERHAPS NOT SO MUCH TO 
BE RESTING YOURSELF AS TO SEE ALL

I DON'T 
THINK I HAD MUCH CHOICE TO BE 
HONEST IT WAS ONE OF THOSE BUT IT 
WAS ALWAYS IN CHARACTER IT WAS KIND 
OF FINE BECAUSE I ALWAYS JUSTIFIED 
WHY THE CHARACTER WAS DOING IT AND 
SOMETIMES IT REALLY FELT AS THOUGH 
IT HAD TO BE THAT WAY BUT AS ZOE I 
USED TO HAVE TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH 
BECAUSE FOR ME IT WAS QUITE 
MORTGAGIFYING BEING ALMOST NAKED 
YOU WERE OFFERED PROPER MONEY TO DO 
IT IN LADS' IMAGINES YOU MUST HAVE 
THOUGHT TWICE EVERYONE HAS THEIR 
PRICE 
EVERYONE HAS THEIR PRICE PRICE BUT MINE WASN'T HIGH ENOUGH FAIR FAIR POINT A MORE SENSIBLE CRACK FER 
NOW IN HOLBY BLUE WE CAN SEE YOU

GREAT ACTRESS CAN YOU MAKE BIRD

WANT TO DO BIRD NOISES WE KNOW

I TELEPHONED HIM AND HIS WIFE 
TURNED AWAY AND TWEETED HE CAME ON 
THE LINE AND SAID I HEAR YOU ARE 
NOT FEELING TOO GOOD THEY 
COMMUNICATED IN BIRD SONG WHAT A 
MARRIAGE 
THERE IS ONE SUBJECT THAT MARRIAGE CLOGS OUR INBOX IT IS LITTER WE 
DROP SIX TIMES MORE THAN WE DID IN 
THE SIXTIES ONE VIEWER SAYS WE MIGHT 
AS WELL CONCENTRATE ON PICKING THE 
STUFF UP HE STARTED A WEBSITE TO 
HELP LITTER HATER TAKE MATTERS 
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS IT IS SO NICE 
TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A WALK IN THE 
GREAT BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE OR AT 
LEAST IT WOULD BE IF IT WASN'T FOR 
ALL THIS LITTER 
WE NOW DROP ABOUT FIVE TIMES MORE 
LITTER THAN WE DID IN THE SIXTIES AND 
ONE MAN STEVEN MCCORMACK HAS HAD 
ENOUGH SO HE HAS ASSEMBLED HIS OWN 
LEGIONEN OF LITTER GATHERERS WE 
HAVE GOT TO GET OUT THERE AND START 
PICKING UP THE LITTER OURSELVES 
WHY IS THIS THERE SO MUCH ROUND I I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT THE 
FACT THAT WE AS A SOCIETY ARE 
CHUCKING MORE LITTER AWAY THAN WE 
USED TO BE PLASTIC BOTTLES DRINKS 
CAN THEY ARE THE THINGS THAT 
PEOPLE INCREASINGLY ARE JUST 
CONSUMING AND THEN TOSSING AWAY 
THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT ANY MORE IT 
ANNOYS ME THAT WHERE EVER YOU GO 
THERE IS LITTER AND OUTSIDE MY 
FRONT DOOR I GET LOTS OF LITTER 
GO OUT AND I PICK IT UP 
WHEN I 
FINISH AND AREA AND LOOK BACK AND 
SEE WHAT A DIFFERENCE I HAVE MADE 
THAT IS LOVELY THAT IS ALL THE 
PAYMENT I NEED 
IN FACT IT'S A GOOD 
THING THIS LOT ARE TACK DGE THE 
PROBLEM BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS LITTER 
COULD BE HANGING ROUND FOR YEARS 
THIS SKIN COULD TAKE UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TEN TO 
BIODEGRADE THESE DRINK CANS COULD 
BE WITH US WELL INTO THE NEXT 
CENTURY AND AS FOR THIS PLASTIC 
BOTTLE YOU COULD BE WAITING UNTIL 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OR LONGER FOR IT TO DISAPPEAR 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
WE HAVE I. D. R. SEEN TODAY HOW 
MUCH WE CAN ACHIEVE AND I AM 
CERTAIN THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE 
ROUND WHO ARE GETTING IT WHO WILL 
REALISE THEY CAN MAKE DIFFERENCE 
AND WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME A 
LARGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THIS 
COUNTRY CAN BECOME A DIFFERENT 
PLACE 
GILES THIS ISN'T THE FIRST PLACE GROUP TO GATHER 
FAR FROM UN ONE 
OF THE GREAT BRITISH INSTITUTION 
THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE GOT TOGETHER 
IN THE FIFTIES AND LAUNCHED CAMPAIGN 
THE W. I. WERE THE PEOPLE WHO LAUNCHED 
THE KEEP BRITAIN TIDY CAMPAIGN 
MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY AGO SO 
SOME GREAT BRITISH WOMEN FORESAW 
THE FUTURE TWO GENERATIONS AGO 
BUT THE FIGHT GOES ON 
WE WERE 
TALKING AND WE AGREED THAT THE 
DEATH PENALTY IS APPROPRIATE FOR 
ANYBODY WHO CHUCKS FAST FOOD 
WRAPPING OUT OF CAR WINDOWS DO YOU 
FEEL STRONGLY 
IT MAKE MISBLOOD 
BOIL IT IS HORRIBLE AWFUL L. 
DON'T UNDERSTAND IT L. DON'T KNOW 
WHY PEOPLE DO THAT IF I SAW 
SOMEBODY DOING IT I WOULD SAY 
SOMETHING 
YOU SAY IF YOU SAW SOMETHING ANYBODY WE DID AN EXPERIMENT 
EARLIER WE WENT TO STIT 
SITTINGBOURNE TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE DO 
WHEN CONFRONTED BY LITTER LOUTS WE 
TOOK A SECRET CAMERA TO WITNESS 
PAVEMENT RAGE AT FIRST HAND YOU 
WILL SEE ONE OF OUR RESEARCHS 
THROWING HIS CUP AWAY HE GETS A 
VARIETY OF REACTIONS THOSE TWO 
BLOKES DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT 
THIS LADY DIDN'T THINK MUCH 
NOBODY IS BOTHERING TO PICK THE CUP 
UP THEY GET MORE ANGRY THIS LADY 
LOOKS LIKE THINGS THINKS A 
HANDBAGING WOULD BE APPROPRIATE HE 
IS CHUCKING THAT HIGHER ALL THE 
TIME BUT THESE TWO DON'T THINK MUCH 
OF IT THEY HAVE TOLD HIM TO PICK 
IT UP AND HERE THIS THIS LADY 
THREATENS TO GIVE HIM A CLIP ROUND 
THE EAR HOLE AND HE COMES BACK AND 
DOES ASED BY TO PICK IT UP BLESS 
HE HE LOOKS EMBARRASSED THERE HE 
MIGHT BE DISGREYFUL BEHAVIOUR IT 
GETS PEOPLE ANGRY 
FOR ME IT FEELS 
LIKE PEOPLE DO IT TO MAKE A 
STATEMENT THAT THEY DON'T CARE ANY 
MORE 
IF WE HAD A BIN EVERY THREE MORE STEPS ALONG THE ROAD PEOPLE WOULD 
STILL THROW IT DOWN 
EVERY 
EVERYWHERE IS DIRTY IT IS NOT VERY 
NICE 
PEOPLE WALK ALONG EATING AND NICE DROP THE CRUSTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU 
WHO KNOWS WHAT IT IS LIKE INSIDE 
THEIR HOUSE STRONG FEELINGS THERE 
LET US KNOW ON THE WEBSITE IF YOU 
HAVE ANY SUGGESTION WHAT WE CAN DO 
LET US LOOK AT YOUR DOG WE HAVEN'T 
GOT IT HERE THERE IT IS 
THAT IS 
CUTE WHAT ASK THE NAME MAG 
MAGGIE SHE WAS TWO MONTH THERE'S 
AND SHE IS NEARLY ELEVEN MONTHS OLD 
DOES HER PERSONALITY MATCH YOURS I I THINK SO YES L. THINK SO 
BUT YOU 
SUSPECTED THAT OR DID YOU GO 
THROUGH ANY ANALYSIS 
NOT AT ALL L. 
THOUGHT THOSE LITTLE ANDREX PUPPIES 
WERE CUTE L. KNEW THEY HAD A NICE 
TEMPERAMENT SHE DOESN'T BARK WHICH 
IS GREAT 
PERSONALITY WITH A DOG 
AND THE OWNER IS CRUCIAL IT IS NOT 
IMPORTANT IT IS CRUCIAL HOW DO YOU 
GO ABOUT FINDING OUT IF THE DOG IS 
RIGHT FOR THE PERSON ELLIE 
HARRISON IS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
WITH A MAN WHO KNOWS N. MEET KEITH 
MATTHEWS HE IS A DOG TRAINING GURU 
HE HAS DEALT WITH NEARLY EVERY 
PROBLEM A DOING COULD DOG COULD 
HAVE KEITH BELIEVES YOU HAVE TO 
START BEING A GOOD DOG OWNER BEFORE 
YOU GET YOUR NEW POOCH 
CHOOSING A 
DOG IS LIKE CHOOSING YOUR PARTNER 
LOOKS COME INTO IT L. MEAN THE DOG 
HAS TO APPEAL TO YOU PHYSICALLY 
BUT DOES THE DOG'S PERSONALITY SUIT 
THAT OF YOURS 
KEITH BELIEVES HE 
CAN ASSESS A DOG'S CHARACTER 
THROUGH HIS EXPERIENCE AND TESTS 
THERE IS FOUR PERSONALITY TYPES 
THERE IS INDEPENDENT DOMINANT SHY 
AND THERE IS RESPONSIVE AND REALLY 
MOST FIRST TIME OWNERS SHOULD BE 
LOOKING FOR DOG THAT FALLS INTO 
THE RESPONSIVE CATEGORY 
SO HE IS 
GOING TO HELP A ONE SHOW VIEWER 
FIND THE RIGHT DOG IVOR LIVES IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND HE HAS GONE BACK 
TO COLLEGE AFTER A INDUSTRIAL 
ACCIDENT HE WANTS A DOG TO HELP 
HIM GET BACK TO FITNESS ANY IDEA 
WHAT KIND YOU WANT 
SOMETHING WITH 
A GOOD TEP PREMENT MEDIUM SIZE 
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS WHAT WE 
NEED TO FIND IS A DOG THAT IS 
ACTIVE NOT OVERLY STRONG NOT 
OVERLY DOMINANT BUT WILL BE 
RESPONSIVE TO TRAINING THOUSANDS THOUSANDS OF DOS END UP ON THE STREETS EVERY 
YEAR THE U. S. P. C. A. IS ONE OF THE MANY 
CHARITIES THAT TRIES TO RETRAIN 
THEM IT IS TOUGH TO TELL WHAT A 
DOG'S CHARACTER IS BUT LOOKING AT 
IT BUT YOU CAN GET AN IDEA IF YOU 
KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR THAT LOOKS 
LIKE A WARM WELCOME WHAT DO YOU 
THINK OF THAT 
THAT IS ALL THE 
OUTWARD SIGNS IS GOOD THE DOG IS 
CONFIDENT IT IS SLIGHTLY 
SUBMISSIVE WHICH INDICATES TO ME 
YES I LOVE HUMAN I AM CONFIDENT TO 
COME UP BUT I REALISE THEY WILL BE 
IN CHARGE SO THAT DOG IS HAPPY TO 
LET A HUMAN ASSUME THE ALPHA ROLE 
THAT IS A DOG THAT IS EASY TRAINED 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ONE VERY VERY INTERESTED IN GET MORGUE DETAILS OF 
THIS DOG 
HE LIKES THIS DOG NOT 
MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT HER BUT SHE IS 
A COLLIE CROSS THOUGHT TO BE ABOUT 
TWO YEARS OLD FIRST APPEARANCES 
CAN BE DECEPTIVE SO KEITH NEEDS TO 
OBSERVER THE DOG FURTHER TO ASSESS 
HER PERSONALITY 
THE THING ABOUT 
ANY DOG IN ANY SITUATION YOU HAVE 
TO TRAIN FOR THE UNEXPECTED WE WANT 
TO SEE A DOG THAT IS CONFIDENT AND 
RESPONSIVE BECAUSE THAT IS A DOG 
THAT WILL BE SUITABLE FOR IVOR'S 
HOME SITUATION 
SO SOUND TEST FIRST 
AS THE DOG IS SHYING AWAY IT 
SUGGESTS SHE MAY HAVE A NERVOUS 
PERSONALITY THIS MEANS SHE WILL 
NEED CAREFUL TRAINING TO BUILD HER 
CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN IVOR WHAT 
IS NEXT 
I AM GOING TO GET HER 
WALKED OUTSIDE ON THE LEAD AND GET 
YOU TO COME FLYING PAST ON A BIKE 
AND SEE HOW SHE REACTS 
HOW WAS 
THAT 
SHE NEVER REALLY RECOVERED THAT GEP THIS IS A DOG THAT IS NERVOUS 
AND AGAIN WOULD NEED A BIT OF 
REHABILITATION AND A LOT OF 
SOCIALLYISATION SO THE FINAL TEST 
IS WE WILL TEST HOW SHE REACTS WITH 
FOOD WHEN SHE IS EATING CAN WE 
REMOVE THE BOWL FROM HER AGAIN 
SHE IS BACKING OFF O. K. SHE MAYBE A 
BIT INTIMIDATED SO I AM GOING TO 
BEND DOWN AND TAKE THE BOWL FROM 
HER MYSELF THAT IS GOOD 
SO THAT WAS GOOD 
THAT WAS GOOD 
SHE BACKED OFF AND LET ME APPROACH 
THE BOWL SO SHE DIDN'T TRY TO 
PROTECT IT THAT IS GOOD TESTING TESTING OVER IT IS TIME FOR THE VERDICT 
AT THIS STAGE I DON'T THINK SHE IS 
READY TO BE HOMED AND I WOULD 
SUGGEST THAT YOU KNOW AFTER 
REHABILITATION PERIOD WHERE SHE IS 
ACCLIMATISED TO A LOT OF THESE 
THING LOUD NOISES SHE COULD BE 
SUITABLE DOG BUT NOT TODAY SHE 
NEEDS A LOT OF TRAIN AND WORK 
WOULD YOU BE PRETEAR TO PUT THE 
WORK IN 
I HAVE LEARNED A LOT SO 
YES HAPPY TO COME BACK UP AND 
ASSESS THE DOG AGAIN 
GREAT FOR 
NOW BACK TO THE KENNELS 
WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF NOT HAVING A 
HAPPY ENDING LESSER PROGRAMMES 
WOULD HAVE PAIRED THEM OFF AND THEY 
WOULD HAVE LIVED HAPPY EVER AFTER 
THAT IS HOW IT WORKS HOLBY BLUE
