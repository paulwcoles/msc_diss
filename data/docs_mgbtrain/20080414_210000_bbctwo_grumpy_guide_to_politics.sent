THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE 
WE'RE GUESSING THAT FOR MOST OF US POLITICS IS A SOURCE OF CONSIDERABLE IRRITATION 
HE GOT ON HIS BIKE AND LOOKED FOR WORK 
OUR MANIFESTO TO ARM YOU WITH SOME INSIDER KNOWLEDGE OF THE NONSENSE PRONE WORLD OF POLITICS 
WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS 
POLITICIANS WANT POWER IF THEY TELL YOU THEY DON'T THEY'RE LYING 
I DID NOT HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH THAT WOMAN 
WHAT EVERY POLITICIAN DREADS IS MEETING THE PUBLIC 
JOHN PRESCOTT SEX SCANDAL 
FOUR WORDS YOU NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D HEAR TOGETHER 
THEY'LL SAY THINGS LIKE WITH RESPECT 
WHICH MEANS FUCK YOU 
LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING TO ASSUME THAT THEY'RE ALL A BIT MAD 
DON'T PANIC EVERYTHING IS PERFECTLY NORMAL I AM IN CONTROL 
HA HA 
WHAT A SILLY BILLY SILLY BILLY 
IT MUST BE THE EYEBROWS I THINK 
CHOICE WHAT CHOICE NO CHOICE 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT POLITICS IS ANY MORE OTHER THAN SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO ANNOY YOU 
POLITICS 
FOR MOST OF US IT'S A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME 
BUT FOR POLITICIANS THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT AMBITION 
GETTING HERE TO THIS FRONT DOOR HERE THEY ARE BLESS THEM 
THEY'VE GOT THE TOP JOB THEY'RE IN POWER RUNNING THE COUNTRY AT THE VERY TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN 
NOW ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS APPOINT SOME TRUSTED ALLIES TO THE CABINET 
AND SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE POWER TRIP 
TROUBLE IS ONCE THEY START DOING THE JOB THINGS HAVE A NASTY HABIT OF GOING WRONG 
WORSE OTHER SO AND S. O. S. WILL HAVE THEIR BEADY EYES ON THE TOP JOB 
JUST LIKE THEY DID 
POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT THE OPPOSITION 
AND WE ALL ASSUME RIGHTLY BROADLY THAT THEY MEAN THE PEOPLE 
ON THE BENCHES OPPOSITE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
THAT IS THE OPPOSITION BUT TALK ABOUT THE ENEMY 
IT'S A DIFFERENT GROUP OF PEOPLE ALTOGETHER THEY'RE THE ONES BEHIND THEM 
YOU GO INTO POWER AS BLAIR DID AND EVERYBODY LOVES YOU 
BECAUSE YOU TOOK 'EM INTO OFFICE AND THEY ALL WANT JOBS 
AND THEY THINK RIGHT 
I'LL KEEP MY NOSE CLEAN I'LL SERVE THE LEADER AND I'LL GET A JOB 
THEN SOME OTHER ROTTEN BASTARD GETS IT INSTEAD OF YOU AND YOU HATE HIM 
ON YOUR OWN SIDE ARE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE 
TO KNIFE YOU IN THE BACK AND STEP OVER YOU TO GET YOUR JOB 
WHO WANT TO BE PREFERRED BEFORE YOU 
WHO BELIEVE THAT YOU DID THEM DOWN LAST TIME WHEN YOU PERHAPS WENT AHEAD OF THEM 
YES YOUR OPPONENTS ARE IN THE OTHER PARTY YOUR ENEMIES ARE IN YOUR OWN 
WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS POISON'S COME FROM THE DISPOSSESSED AND THE NEVER POSSESSED 
YOU AND I CAN BOTH THINK OF EX MINISTERS WHO ARE CAUSING ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE 
DO WE WANT THREE MORE OF THE BASTARDS OUT THERE 
COURSE JOHN MAJOR FAMOUSLY REFERRED TO THE BASTARDS 
AND HE WASN'T TALKING ABOUT LABOUR HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS OWN SIDE 
COS HE WAS SO FRUSTRATED BY PEOPLE HE THOUGHT WERE UNDERMINING HIM FROM WITHIN 
JUST THE TWO OF US 
WE CAN MAKE IT IF WE TRY 
THE ULTIMATE INTERNAL POWER STRUGGLE WAS THE SAGA OF THE ENEMY NEXT DOOR 
BLAIR AND BROWN MADE THAT FAMOUS PACT AND SPENT THE NEXT TEN YEARS DAGGERS DRAWN 
BUT THINLY DISGUISED IT AS SOLID CAMARADERIE 
GO ON GORDON HAVE AN ICE CREAM 
WATCHING THEM JOSTLING FOR POSITION MADE PARTY CONFERENCES ALMOST WORTHWHILE 
THE THING TO LOOK OUT FOR AT PARTY CONFERENCES IS THE WAY THE NUMBER TWO THE HEIR APPARENT 
LOOKS AT THE LEADER AS THE LEADER IS SPEAKING AND THE WAY THEY APPLAUD 
AND HOW MEASURED THE APPLAUSE IS LIKELY TO BE 
JUST THE TWO OF US 
WE CAN MAKE IT IF WE TRY JUST THE TWO 
ONE OF THE FEW MOMENTS OF REAL ENJOYMENT IN PARTY CONFERENCES 
THE ENEMY THE PERSON WHO WANTS THE JOB AND THE PERSON WHO'S MAKING THE SPEECH 
FACE IT PARTY POLITICS CAN BE AS DULL AS DITCHWATER 
BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT A SEX SCANDAL COMES ALONG 
TO BRING EVEN THE GRANDEST POLITICIAN DOWN TO EARTH WITH A BANG 
EASILY THE BEST IN SHOW WAS THE PROFUMO AFFAIR IN SIXTY THREE 
I'M MAD ABOUT THE BOY 
AN EXOCET OF A SCANDAL INVOLVING A CABINET MINISTER A CALL GIRL AND A RUSSIAN SPY 
IT ALL BUT BROUGHT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY 
AND IT STARTED A SOLID TORY TRADITION OF SEX SCANDALS 
AND SLEAZE WHICH KEPT THE TABLOIDS IN BUSINESS FOR YEARS TO COME 
ABOUT THE BOY 
THE TRIUMPH OBVIOUSLY OF BEING A POLITICIAN 
THE POINT OF BEING A POLITICIAN IS SO YOU GET LAID 
THEY DO SEEM TO NEED TO GET THEIR ENDS AWAY 
A LOT MORE THAN THE REST OF US 
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF SEX ROMPS IN POLITICS 
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH UGLINESS AND THE IDEA 
IT'S JUST ALL THOSE DINGY BRAS 
WESTMINSTER AT NIGHT HAS TO BE HOTTER THAN ANY CLUB THAT YOU KNOW ANYWHERE 
THE SEXUAL ENERGY IS ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING 
POWER MUST BE AN APHRODISIAC OTHERWISE PEOPLE LIKE ME WOULD ALWAYS BE SINGLE 
SORRY STEVEN WE COULDN'T HELP NOTICING HOW NOT AT ALL SINGLE YOU'VE BEEN OVER THE YEARS 
THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING ABOUT POLITICS AND SEX 
BUT OCCASIONALLY WE CAN ALL BE DUMBSTRUCK WHEN A SEX SCANDAL BREAKS 
REVELATIONS OF JOHN PRESCOTT'S AFFAIR 
WITH HIS DIARY SECRETARY TRACEY WERE NOT EXACTLY PREDICTABLE OR EVEN TO SOME OF US FEASIBLE 
STILL I SUPPOSE WE NOW KNOW WHAT A DIARY SECRETARY DOES 
OTHER PICTURES SHOWED TRACEY TEMPLE WAITING 
WITH MR. PRESCOTT'S WIFE PAULINE FOR THE QUEEN'S JUBILEE ADDRESS IN WESTMINSTER HALL 
LATER THEY WERE JOINED BY THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER 
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE IT HAD TO HAPPEN WASN'T IT 
IT WAS LIKE COMEDY WRITERS EVERYWHERE HAD BEEN WAITING WITH A PEN 
YOU KNOW TO WRITE TWO SHAGS 
WHY DOES IT FEEL SO GOOD 
HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE 
SOMEBODY WHO'D BE 
DASHING INTO A CUPBOARD TO BONK A SECRETARY JUST EVERY NOW AND THEN 
IF THIS JAG'S A ROCKING DON'T COME A KNOCKIN' 
SOME POLITICIANS MANAGE TO SEEK OUT PUBLICITY AND BE ECONOMICAL WITH THE TRUTH 
LIKE JOHN AND EDWINA KEEPING THAT SECRET FOR SO LONG 
THERE HE WAS BANGING ON ABOUT FAMILY VALUES ON HIS SOAPBOX 
AND THERE SHE WAS BANGING ON ABOUT EGGS 
AND LITTLE DID WE KNOW THEY'D BEEN BANGING ON TOGETHER ABOUT SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT 
YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIRE THE SHEER AUDACITY OF IT 
THEY'D BEEN LOVERS FOR TWO YEARS WHEN THESE PICTURES WERE TAKEN 
THE AFFAIR STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND ENDED FOUR YEARS LATER WHEN JOHN MAJOR WAS PROMOTED TO THE CABINET 
IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE JOHN MAJOR 
EVERY DAY HE WAS IN THERE HE KNEW HE WAS SITTING ON A POWDER KEG OF A SECRET 
THAT COULD SUDDENLY EXPLODE AND BLOW HIM OUT OF OFFICE 
THERE WAS ONE BIG VERY SURPRISING THING 
ABOUT THE JOHN MAJOR AND EDWINA CURRIE AFFAIR 
AND THAT WAS THAT EDWINA WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE SECRET FOR SO LONG 
THAT WAS A VERY VERY WELL GUARDED SECRET THE MAJOR CURRIE ROMANCE 
BECAUSE OF COURSE NO ONE IMAGINED THAT MAJOR WAS A SEX FIEND 
ALL OVER WESTMINSTER PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE KEEPING THEIR AFFAIRS QUIET 
BUT THEIR DRIVERS KNOW THESE WERE TWO MINISTERS THEY HAD DRIVERS 
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY ANYBODY INCLUDING PPSS 
THAT'S PRIVATE SECRETARIES TO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WASN'T SURPRISED 
PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED ABOUT THE WHOLE EDWINA CURRIE JOHN MAJOR THING 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL THAT TWO SUCH UGLY POINTLESS PEOPLE 
HAD FOUND EACH OTHER AND THEY WERE DOING IT 
IT'S ALWAYS THE QUIET ONES WITH GLASSES WHO ARE AT IT LIKE RABBITS 
AND THAT SEEMS TO SUM THE WHOLE THING UP 
O. K. SO ENOUGH OF THIS CHEEKY ROMP THROUGH POLITICAL SLIP UPS FOR NOW ANYWAY 
TIME FOR SOME POLITICAL DEFINITIONS CONSERVATIVE FOR INSTANCE 
FIRST THING THAT COMES INTO YOUR HEAD ANYONE 
BLUE PRAGMATIC AND SENSIBLE 
IF THE CLOCK'S TICKING DON'T FIX IT 
PERHAPS FINISHED WE DON'T LIKE THEM THATCHER 
CONSERVATIVE MEANS TO ME 
SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO KEEP US ALL IN THE VICTORIAN AGE 
THE FACT IT'S CONSERVATIVE MEANS THEY ARE BY DEFINITION BORING 
WHAT DOES CONSERVATIVE MEAN NOW I HAVEN'T A BLOODY CLUE WOULD SOMEBODY LIKE TO TELL US 
STUFFY OLD FARTS BASICALLY 
WINSTON CHURCHILL IS ONCE AGAIN CALLED TO GUIDE OUR DESTINY 
THE TORIES THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF THE PARTIES LAST CENTURY HAVE A STRONG BELIEF IN THE MARKET ECONOMY 
LIKE THE WORD CHOICE FOR WHICH READ THEY LOOK AFTER THE MIDDLE CLASS WHO VOTE TORY 
TRADITIONALLY RUN BY POSH SO AND S. O. S. LIKE NEVILLE PEACE IN OUR TIME CHAMBERLAIN 
WINSTON FIGHT THEM ON THE BEACHES CHURCHILL AND ANTHONY SUEZ CRISIS EDEN 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ORDER SIR YES 
I WILL HAVE A STEAK 
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT OH RAW PLEASE 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE VEGETABLES 
OH THEY'LL HAVE THE SAME AS ME 
THATCHER MADE A BIT OF AN IMPACT A GROCER'S DAUGHTER FROM GRANTHAM 
SHE CRUSHED THE TRADE UNIONS ANNIHILATED THE MINERS INVENTED POLL TAX RIOTS 
AND PRIVATISED EVERYTHING SHE COULD IN HER SPARE TIME 
SHE GAVE BIRTH TO YUPPIES A CITY BOOM AND DECIDEDLY DECISIVE CATCHPHRASES 
THE LADY'S NOT FOR TURNING 
NOW THE LABOUR PARTY ANY THOUGHTS 
SMOKE FILLED ROOMS BEER AND SANDWICHES AT NUMBER TEN HARD WORK 
DOESN'T EXIST ANY MORE 
LARGE GATHERINGS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T CLEAN THEIR SUITS TERRIBLY WELL 
AND WHO TAKE THEIR OWN OPINIONS TERRIBLY SERIOUSLY 
THE LABOUR PARTY DOES WHAT IT SAYS ON THE CAN OR DID 
OLD LABOUR WAS INVENTED TO REPRESENT THE WORKING MAN 
NYE BEVAN CAME UP WITH THE N. H. S. 
AND LABOUR FORMED THE FIRST ALL BALD CABINET HEADED BY CLEMENT ATTLEE 
THE TROUBLE STARTED WHEN THEY LOST THE PLOT 
MICHAEL DONKEY JACKET FOOT DIDN'T NOTICE THAT THE WORKING CLASS HAD TURNED INTO THE NEW BOURGEOISIE 
THEN NEIL ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT KINNOCK THOUGHT HE WAS A ROCK STAR AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS IN OPPOSITION 
HE THOUGHT THINGS COULD ONLY GET BETTER 
WE HAVE BEEN ELECTED AS NEW LABOUR AND WE WILL GOVERN AS NEW LABOUR 
THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER 
BLAIR'S NEW LABOUR TURNED OUT TO BE THE TICKET TO POWER THEY NEEDED CRUCIALLY 
HE DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM TRADE UNIONS MOVED TOWARDS THE CENTRE AND SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON P. R. 
NEW LABOUR LIKE THE NEW TORIES REPRESENT 
A BRITAIN IN WHICH THE CLASS WAR HAS PRACTICALLY DISAPPEARED 
AFTER NEW LABOUR CAME NEW NEW LABOUR UNDER GORDON BROWN 
OBVIOUSLY HE HAD TO CREATE A NEW NEW IMAGE SO OUT WITH THE SMILEY SLICK BLAIR APPROACH 
AND IN WITH THE GRUFFER ROUGHER GRITTIER BROWN LOOK 
I DON'T ACTUALLY MIND GORDON BROWN'S GRUMPINESS 
IT'S QUITE NICE TO HAVE A POLITICIAN FROM TIME TO TIME 
WHO DOESN'T KEEP GRINNING FROM EAR TO EAR ALL THE TIME 
GORDON BROWN REMINDS ME OF ONE OF THOSE BIG DEEP SEA FISHES 
MAINLY BECAUSE HE STICKS HIS MOUTH OUT BEFORE HE SPEAKS 
AS IF HE'S ABOUT TO GO FOR A WORM OR SOMETHING OR A SMALLER FISH 
HE NEEDS TO LOSE THE PAH WHEN HE TALKS 
PAH 
THAT MAN'S DYING SEVEN TIMES IN EVERY MINUTE YOU KNOW 
HE'LL GO PAH 
HE LOOKS LIKE SHREK NOT WHEN SHREK WAS GREEN AND INTERESTING 
BUT WHEN SHREK GOT TURNED INTO A HUMAN BEING 
BUT HERE'S A SURPRISE THE LESS SMILEY APPROACH SEEMS TO HAVE GOT HIM THE LADIES' VOTE 
APPARENTLY THE SMOULDERING SERIOUS LOOK IS RATHER ATTRACTIVE 
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND GORDON BROWN QUITE ATTRACTIVE I HAVE TO SAY 
I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A REALLY I THINK SOLID QUALITY ABOUT HIM 
THAT SUGGESTS THAT HE'S ROOTED 
AND I QUITE LIKE THAT 
I FIND THAT VERY SEXY IN A MAN 
I ADORE GORDON BROWN YES 
HE SEEMS TO ME TOTALLY STRAIGHT TOTALLY WONDERFUL 
I MEAN NOT A LOOKER BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER IN A POLITICIAN 
UNFORTUNATELY BROWN DOES IT FOR ME COS HE COULD WEAR A KILT HE'S LEGALLY ENTITLED TO A KILT 
O. K. THIRD IN THE THREE HORSE PARTY RACE HOW MANY OF US KNOW 
WHAT THE LIBERAL PARTY STANDS FOR OR THE LIB DEMS AS THEY'RE NOW CALLED LET'S SEE ANYONE KNOW 
WAFFLE DRUNK 
NICE KIND OF INNOCUOUS REALLY QUITE USELESS 
LIBERAL MEANS NICE FLUFFY BUNNY RABBITS ALL THAT KIND OF THING 
WE'RE ALL IN FAVOUR OF THAT WET 
THEY CALL ME MELLOW YELLOW 
A GOOD THING TO DROP INTO CONVERSATION IS THEY EMERGED FROM THE WHIGS 
NOT THESE KIND OF WIGS MORE LIKE THESE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
SOMETHING ABOUT CHARLES THE SECOND AND PARLIAMENTARY REFORMISTS 
NOW IT'S ALL STARTING TO SOUND LIKE DOUBLE PHYSICS 
MEMORABLE FOR THEIR POSITIVELY ACCIDENT PRONE CHOICE IN LEADERS 
JEREMY JUICY SEX SCANDAL THORPE 
PADDY PANTSDOWN ASHDOWN AND CHARLES MINE'S A DOUBLE KENNEDY 
THEN THEY PLUMPED FOR A LEADER CALLED MING 
CATCHY 
THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE JACK RUSSELLS PLAYING WITH THE ROTTWEILERS IN THE PARK 
THEY'LL NEVER BE THERE BUT THEY MAKE A GOOD SHOW 
EVERYBODY LIKES THEM YOU CAN VOTE FOR THEM AND IT WON'T DO ANY HARM 
ONE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW IF YOU'RE A POLITICIAN 
IS THAT TO GET ANYWHERE IN POLITICS 
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HOLD YOUR OWN 
HOLD YOUR GROUND AND HOLD YOUR NERVE 
WITH SOME OF THE TOUGHEST MOST ARGUMENTATIVE 
POLITICAL JOURNALISTS ON THE PLANET 
CAN YOU GIVE AN ASSURANCE THERE WILL BE NO VAT ON FOOD 
CHILDREN'S CLOTHES TRANSPORT I'M I'M 
DO YOU EVER WONDER WHETHER YOU'RE UP TO THE JOB NO NOT AT ALL 
DO YOU LIKE BEING CHANCELLOR I ENJOY BEING CHANCELLOR HUGELY 
ARE YOU GONNA MISS IT I'M NOT GONNA GET DRAWN IN 
DO YOU HAVE A VIEW YOU'RE TRYING TO DRAW ME INTO ONE SIDE 
I'M ASKING IF YOU HAVE A VIEW 
DON'T IF YOU WISH GIVE ME YOUR VIEW BUT YOU CAN AT LEAST TELL ME WHETHER YOU HAVE ONE 
THE PURPOSE OF THE INTERVIEW ULTIMATELY MOSTLY 
IS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION 
THAT INFORMATION MAY BE INFORMATION 
THE POLITICIAN DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE YOU 
AND THEN OF COURSE THE HUNT IS ON 
THEY KNOW FROM THE SLIGHTEST FLICKER OF AN EYELID 
WHEN THEY HAVE STARTED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T ANSWER 
THEY KNOW FROM THE SLIGHTEST FLICKER OF YOUR MOUTH MUSCLES 
WHEN YOU'RE INWARDLY SMILING 
BECAUSE THEY'VE ASKED YOU JUST WHAT YOU WERE HOPING TO HEAR THEY KNOW 
THEY WATCH YOU LIKE A HAWK 
IT IS MOSTLY A GENUINE ATTEMPT TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON 
AND IF THEY OFFER WHAT YOU NEED WHAT YOU WANT THEN THAT'S IT 
YOU SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MINISTER 
OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE 
IT ISN'T I GRANT YOU ALWAYS LIKE THAT 
AND SOMETIMES IT DOES COME ACROSS AS A BIT OF A GLADIATORIAL CONTEST 
IF YOU ASK THAT QUESTION AGAIN I'M GOING 
LET ME ASK A BLUNT QUESTION DID YOU LIE NO I DID NOT LIE 
IS THE PRESENT POLICY THE RIGHT POLICY 
OH JEREMY DO STOP THIS NONSENSE 
WELL I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO STOP THE INTERVIEW 
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT ANYTHING ELSE 
WHO WANTED THE INTERVIEW 
LIKE NEIL KINNOCK SAYING HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND BUT CAN'T TELL US 
NO IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING THAT ANYONE ELSE HAS SAID 
IT'S TO DO WITH WHAT I'VE JUST SAID 
TEDDY TAYLOR SAYING ONE THING YOU COULD DO IMMEDIATELY 
IS SAY YOU WON'T HAVE THE SECOND HIKE ON VAT 
WE WON'T HAVE A BRILLIANT INTERVIEW IF YOU KEEP HECTORING ME IF YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION 
YOU ARE ACTUALLY CONDUCTING EVEN BY YOUR STANDARDS 
ONE OF THE MOST ABSURD INTERVIEWS I HAVE EVER PARTICIPATED IN 
CONGRATULATIONS MR. GALLOWAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO USE YOUR TIME THANK YOU OH I SEE 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERVIEWERS AND POLITICIANS IS A TWO WAY THING 
PEOPLE THINK THAT HUMPHRYS AND PAXMAN ARE RUDE 
BUT IN FACT THEIR RUDENESS HAS EVOLVED 
IN TANDEM WITH POLITICIANS TRAINING AND ABILITY TO DEFLECT QUESTIONS 
A BIG KEY WHEN YOU'RE IN A DIFFICULT HOLE IS TO SMILE 
AND MAYBE TO TRY AND LIGHTEN THE MOOD 
SAY HA HA WELL THAT IS A TOUGH QUESTION 
YOU KNOW WHATEVER BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE REALLY THINKING IS 
GOD WHAT AM I GONNA SAY NOW 
HE'LL PROBABLY KNOW AND YOU KNOW AND HE KNOWS YOU KNOW 
AND YOU KNOW HE KNOWS YOU KNOW 
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED ME THAT QUESTION 
AND ANY OF THOSE LITTLE MINI SENTENCES 
THAT DON'T SEEM TO MEAN ANYTHING 
WILL MEAN A LOT TO ANYONE WHO'S DONE MEDIA TRAINING 
BECAUSE WHAT IT'S CALLED IS THE MOMENT TO THINK 
AND COME UP WITH AN ANSWER 
AND YOU DO SEE THAT EMPLOYED MORE AND MORE THESE DAYS 
ALL POLITICIANS SEEM TO HAVE GONE TO THE SCHOOL OF LEARNING TO AVOID 
TACKLING THE SUBJECT THAT IS BEING TACKLED 
AND THAT'S INTENSELY FRUSTRATING 
YOU WOULDN'T PUT UP WITH A CONVERSATION LIKE THAT WITH FRIENDS 
SO WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT FROM THEM 
POLITICS HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN FULL OF SUCH DISRESPECTFUL SNIPING 
BEFORE TWENTY FOUR HOUR TELLY NEWS PEOPLE CAME OUT IN THEIR DROVES 
TO HEAR POLITICIANS MAKE SERIOUS SPEECHES 
CHURCHILL OPENS FIRE IN THE BATTLE OF THE COMING ELECTION 
FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PACKED THE WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS' FOOTBALL GROUND 
TO HEAR THE TORY LEADER SPEAK 
THEY FILLED FOOTBALL STADIUMS THEY WERE PROPERLY INSPIRING 
THEY WERE ORATORS THEY STIRRED THE MASSES 
SOME OF THEIR SPEECHES MADE THEIR WAY INTO HISTORY 
WE SHALL FIGHT ON THE BEACHES WE SHALL FIGHT ON THE LANDING GROUNDS 
WE SHALL FIGHT IN THE FIELDS AND IN THE STREETS 
WE SHALL FIGHT IN THE HILLS 
WE SHALL NEVER SURRENDER 
THEY SAID WE'VE NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN OF COURSE THAT THE POUND HERE IN BRITAIN 
IN YOUR POCKET OR PURSE OR IN YOUR BANK HAS BEEN DEVALUED 
ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR YOU 
ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR COUNTRY 
NOW EVERYONE'S FAR TOO BUSY 
TO STAND IN THE RAIN LISTENING TO POLITICAL ORATORY 
SO POLITICIANS GO FOR CATCHY LITTLE SOUNDBITES NOT SPEECHES 
UNFORTUNATELY SOME SOUNDBITES BACKFIRE 
AND BITE THEM BACK FOR EVER MORE 
A DAY LIKE TODAY I MEAN IT'S NOT A DAY FOR SOUNDBITES REALLY 
UM WE CAN LEAVE THOSE AT HOME 
BUT I FEEL THE HAND OF HISTORY UPON OUR SHOULDER 
GO BACK TO YOUR CONSTITUENCIES AND PREPARE FOR GOVERNMENT 
SHE WAS THE PEOPLE'S PRINCESS 
IT IS TIME TO RETURN TO THOSE OLD CORE VALUES 
TIME TO GET BACK TO BASICS 
I AM A FIGHTER AND NOT A QUITTER 
WHERE THERE IS DISCORD MAY WE BRING HARMONY 
WHERE THERE IS ERROR MAY WE BRING TRUTH 
WHERE THERE IS DOUBT MAY WE BRING FAITH 
AND WHERE THERE IS DESPAIR MAY WE BRING HOPE 
SOUNDBITES ARE SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO CRUCIAL TO GET RIGHT 
THERE IS NO SURPRISE DAVID CAMERON HAS TURNED THEM INTO AN ART FORM 
THIS IS MY COUNTRY THIS IS MY COMMUNITY 
I WANT TO PLAY MY PART 
SENSIBLE CENTRE RIGHT PARTY 
THAT WOULD DO SENSIBLE CENTRE RIGHT THINGS 
NOTHING AND NO ONE WILL STOP US 
DAVID CAMERON IS FANTASTIC ON SOUNDBITES 
AND I THINK THE BEST POLICY IDEA DAVID CAMERON EVER CAME UP WITH 
WAS TO HAVE NO POLICIES BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION 
COS IT'S BRILLIANT 
YOU'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO HIM IT'S A BRILLIANT POLICY 
COS HE'S VERY CLEVER SO HE COMES UP WITH GREAT STUFF 
AND HOW CAN YOU ATTACK SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE A POLICY 
IT'S LIKE TRYING TO NAIL JELLY TO A WALL WELL DONE DAVID 
NEVER CONFIDENT TILL THEY OPEN THOSE BALLOT BOXES 
DAVID CAMERON TOOK A LEAF OUT OF BLAIR'S BOOK 
WORK HARD AT BEING NICE 
SO HE PLAYED DOWN THE ETON TOFF AND PLAYED UP THE FAMILY MAN 
WENT ALL GREEN GOT A BIKE 
NEVER RODE IT MUCH BUT GOT ONE 
AND LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO MAKE A CUP OF COFFEE 
AND CHANGE A NAPPY BRILLIANT 
SO IF YOU SHOULD EVER DOUBT 
I DO LIKE CAMERON WEIRDLY ENOUGH 
SORRY I DO IT'S THAT WHERE HE'S REALLY NICE WITH HIS BABIES 
THAT DOES IT FOR WOMEN YOU SEE 
WHAT'S HIS POLITICAL LEANINGS 
WHAT'S HE BELIEVE IN I'VE NO IDEA 
BUT OH AIN'T HE LOVELY WITH HIS KIDS 
HE WAS FRIGHTENED THAT PEOPLE WOULD THINK 
HE WAS A SORT OF OLD ETONIAN GENT 
UM SO HE WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM ALL THAT 
AND MAKE PEOPLE THINK THAT HE WAS 
YOU KNOW AN ORDINARY WELL STRAIGHT KIND OF GUY JUST LIKE MR. BLAIR 
HIS FACE ISN'T REALLY VERY DISTINCTIVE 
HE'S GOT NICE RED CHEEKS AND EXPENSIVE LOOKING HAIR DO 
SLICKED BACK 
WHAT MOST CARTOONISTS LATCH ON TO IS HIS BACKGROUND 
HE'S A TOFF 
SO HE'S PORTRAYED AS LORD SNOOTY OR LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY 
DAVID CAMERON'S ALREADY IN TROUBLE 
BECAUSE HE TOOK CANNABIS AT SCHOOL HE TOOK IT 
WHAT DO THEY THING IT IS THAT HE TOOK 
SO HE SMOKED A SPLIFF OH PLEASE 
LIKE MANY PEOPLE I DID THINGS WHEN I WAS YOUNG 
THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE AND THAT I REGRET 
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED 
IT MEANS HE'S HAVING A GO AT SOME STREET CRED 
IT'S HARD FOR AN ETONIAN TO ACCUMULATE ANY STREET CRED AT ALL 
BUT A SPLIFF ISN'T GONNA DO IT FOR HIM 
I'M SPINNING AROUND 
IMAGE IS SO CRITICAL EVERYTHING'S STAGE MANAGED FOR THE CAMERAS 
RULE ONE TAKE YOUR JACKET OFF 
MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE YOU CAN ROLL YOUR SLEEVES UP IN A CRISIS 
RULE TWO FIND A PET TO STROKE IT'LL MAKE YOU LOOK KIND 
RULE THREE FIND SOME TROOPS TO GEE UP OR A TANK TO DRIVE 
MAKES YOU LOOK MACHO EVEN IF YOU'RE A WOMAN 
RULE FOUR SIT ON ONE OF THOSE TEENY WEENY CHAIRS 
IN AN INFANT SCHOOL AND READ A CUTE LITTLE POP UP BOOK 
MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A FAMILY MAN KISS A BABY EVEN BETTER 
RULE FIVE PULL A PINT AT THE LOCAL PUB 
THAT WORKED FOR HAROLD WILSON LET'S ALL DO IT 
LOOK LIKE WE'RE ONE OF THE LADS EVEN IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD A PINT OF BEER BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE 
EXCEPT DON'T DRINK TOO MUCH DENIS 
WRONG MESSAGE 
RULE SIX HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH SOME POOR PEOPLE 
BETTER STILL A MUG OF TEA MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A MAN OF THE PEOPLE 
ENTER SPIN DOCTORS AND THE BLACK ART OF SPINNING 
CLEVER STUFF BRILLIANTLY CHOREOGRAPHED 
BY CLEVER SO AND S. O. S. LIKE ALASTAIR CAMPBELL THE MAESTRO OF SPIN 
BUT DON'T THINK HE INVENTED IT 
APPARENTLY IT'S BEEN AROUND EVEN LONGER THAN DAVID DIMBLEBY 
SPIN IS AS OLD AS POLITICS 
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN WITH US AND ALWAYS WILL BE WITH US 
THE IDEA THAT ANY POLITICIAN HAS EVER BEEN ENTIRELY UNCONSCIOUS 
OF THE EFFECT THAT HE OR SHE IS MAKING ON THE AUDIENCE IS LAUGHABLE 
ELIZABETH I CERTAINLY SPUN 
HENRY THE EIGHTH HAD A VERY GOOD IDEA OF HOW HE WANTED TO LOOK 
DISRAELI WAS A WONDERFUL MANIPULATOR OF HIS OWN IMAGE 
CHURCHILL LIVED FOR HIS PUBLIC IMAGE 
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEW ABOUT SOMEONE IN THE PUBLIC EYE 
GIVING SOME THOUGHT TO HOW TO PRESENT THEMSELVES 
SO THAT PEOPLE WILL LIKE THEM MORE THAT'S ALL IT IS 
POLITICIANS AREN'T GONNA TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT SPENDING MONEY 
THEY ALWAYS TALK NOW ABOUT INVESTING MONEY IN HOSPITALS OR SCHOOLS 
OR WHATEVER IT IS 
TO CREATE A NICE IMAGE 
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME KIND OF RETURN ON THIS 
EVERY STORY YOU HEAR IS BEING CONTROLLED BY SPIN DOCTORS 
THE TIMING OF EVERY RELEASE OF EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION IS CHANNELLED 
THROUGH THE SPIN OFFICE AT NUMBER TEN AND THE CHIEF WHIP 
AND EVERYTHING IS CAREFULLY MONITORED 
YOU CAN SPIN AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
BUT EVERYTHING POLITICIANS DO IS ON CAMERA 
SO WHEN THINGS DON'T GO ACCORDING TO PLAN WE ALL GET TO SEE IT 
POLITICS WOULD BE SO DULL WITHOUT ALL THEIR SPONTANEOUS COCK UPS 
NO I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET THE SNAPPERS TO GO AWAY 
I WILL BE ABLE TO GET OUT BUT IT'S 
THIS IS REALLY WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
IT'S ABOUT OUR KIDS AND OUR SCHOOLS EDUCATION BY THE WAY LITTLE TIP 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO PICK UP A SMALL CHILD FOR THE CAMERAS BEST TO CHECK WITH THEIR PARENTS FIRST 
ANOTHER TIP IF YOU'RE THE SECRETARY FOR WALES 
AND YOU FIND YOURSELF ACCIDENTALLY IN WALES YOU NEED TO KNOW THE WORDS OF THEIR NATIONAL ANTHEM 
JUST WIGGLING YOUR HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE IS NOT GOING TO DO IT 
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST 
SOMETHING LIKE SEVENTY TO EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE ACTUAL DEMAND ARE SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS 
OR SINGLE YOUNGSTERS OR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN A SINGLE HOUSE 
CAN WE DO THAT AGAIN I MADE THAT CRAP SORRY WE'RE LIVE AT THE MOMENT MR. PRESCOTT 
ANY HUMAN BEING DREADS BEING PUT ON THE SPOT REALLY BADLY 
THE THING ABOUT POLITICIANS WHEN YOU'RE PUT ON THE SPOT 
A THERE'S USUALLY A T. V. CAMERA CREW THERE TO CAPTURE IT AND B. YOU CAN LOSE YOUR POLITICAL CAREER 
LIKE IN A FLASH MUCKING SOMETHING UP ON THE TELLY WON'T GET YOU VOTES 
WHICH IN THE END IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS 
IT'S STILL ONE MAN ONE VOTE IN A DRAFTY SCHOOL HALL 
AND WE GET TO ELECT THE POLITICIANS WE FIND THE LEAST IRRITATING 
WHEN PEOPLE SAY TO ME OH I DON'T VOTE 
I COULD JUST SLAP THEM YOU ARE PROUD OF THIS FOR WHAT REASON 
THAT'S LIKE COMING OUT OF THE LOO AND SAYING I DIDN'T WASH MY HANDS 
YOU WOULD NEVER DO THAT THEN DON'T BE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T VOTE 
AND IN PICCADILLY AS IN HUNDREDS OF OTHER CENTRES 
THE EXCITED CROWDS WAIT FOR RESULTS CHEERING AS THE RACE PROCEEDS 
GENERAL ELECTIONS ARE TO POLITICS WHAT THE WORLD CUP IS TO FOOTBALL BUT WITH MORE INJURY TIME 
IT'S ONE BIG LONG PUNCH UP 
YES OVER THE NEXT EIGHTEEN HOURS WE SHALL HAVE A SUCCESSION OF VICTORS VANQUISHED AND WALKING WOUNDED 
UP HERE TO EXPLAIN WHAT WENT RIGHT WHAT WENT WRONG AND WHAT HAPPENS NOW IN THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTIES 
OH GOOD EIGHTEEN HOURS OF IT 
JUST AS WELL MOST OF US ENJOY THE DRAMA THAT IS ELECTION NIGHT 
WATCHING THE COUNTS COME IN WAITING FOR SOME DELICIOUSLY DAMNING DEFEATS 
PORTILLO CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
NINETEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN 
MUST BE HARD TO KEEP THAT FIXED GRIN ON YOUR FACE 
WHEN YOUR OPPONENT LOOKS ABOUT TWELVE AND IS IN SHORT TROUSERS 
ZERO POINT TWO ZERO 
A MASSIVE DEFEAT FOR NEIL HAMILTON 
TWENTY NINE THOUSAND FOR MARTIN BELL EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FOR NEIL HAMILTON 
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY 
OUT OUT OUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED VOTES IS A DERISORY TOTAL 
WHEN MELLOR LOST GOLDSMITH ALL HE COULD DO WAS SHOUT OUT OUT OUT 
THIS 
IT WAS A VERY THAT WAS SORT OF ALMOST THE LAST VIEW WE HAD OF THIS MAN 
IT WAS VERY VERY FUNNY IN THE OLD DAYS 
ALL THEY HAD TO FILL IN THE GAPS ON ELECTION NIGHT WAS THIS 
THE SWINGOMETER WHICH IS NOTHING LESS THAN A BRITISH INSTITUTION 
THE DEATH OF THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL SWINGOMETER WHICH WAS SO RUBBISH 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE OLD FOOTAGE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY KNOCKED IT UP ON BLUE PETER 
IT'S JUST A BIT OF WOOD WITH A NAIL IN IT THAT MOVES ABOUT 
BUT COMPUTER GRAPHICS HAVE COMPLETELY CHANGED ELECTION NIGHT 
YOU CAN TRACK THE HISTORY OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS THROUGH GENERAL ELECTIONS 
AS THE RESULTS COME IN WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE HOWS AND WHYS 
YOU CAN RELY ON PETER SNOW TO DAZZLE US WITH ALL HIS LATEST TOYS 
LOOK AT THIS ONE IT'S GOT DOORS AND EVERYTHING 
SPENT FOUR YEAR PERFECTING THIS ONE IT'S FABULOUS FUN 
THERE GOES EXETER HERE COMES PORTSMOUTH NORTH 
THE MOST DIFFICULT OF THOSE TARGETS TO HIT 
THERE WAS ONE YEAR WHEN HE HAD A FRIGHTENING THING WHERE THE CAMERA 
SWOOPED DOWN OVER THE COUNTRY LIKE THAT 
AND GREAT BIG SKYSCRAPER THINGS WERE BURSTING OUT OF THE GROUND 
OTHERWISE JUST DEVASTATION EVERYWHERE 
IT'S GOING TO BE NINETY EIGHT HITS ON THAT TARGET 
AND TWO MISSES ONLY 
THEY'D ALL COME UP IN DIFFERENT COLOURS AND HE WAS WETTING HIMSELF WITH EXCITEMENT 
WE CAN RANT AND RAVE AS MUCH AS WE LIKE ABOUT THE GOINGS ON IN WESTMINSTER 
AND THE FUTILITY OF THE CORRIDORS OF POWER BUT FOR NOW IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE STUCK WITH THEM 
SO WHAT ULTIMATELY FOR THE VERY GRUMPY PERSON MAKES A RELATIVELY GOOD POLITICIAN 
THEY'VE GOT TO BE BASICALLY FAIRLY BORING PEOPLE 
UNSCRUPULOUS 
DEVIOUS 
CALCULATING 
I'M ALL FOR A VERY DULL POLITICIAN OF TOTAL HONESTY I GUESS 
I THINK PEOPLE LIKE POLITICIANS WHO TELL IT THE WAY IT IS 
PEOPLE LIKE A POLITICIAN WHO HAS A SENSE OF HUMOUR 
AND DOESN'T MIND PEOPLE LAUGHING AT HIM 
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST 
AND ANOTHER ONE GONE AND ANOTHER ONE GONE 
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST 
HEY I'M GONNA GET YOU TOO 
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST 
SO UNFAIR YOU GET NO SAY OVER WHO'S ON YOUR TEAM BUT YOU GET THE BLAME 
IT'S RIDICULOUS 
TELEVISON EMPHASIS ON WINNERS AND LOSERS WHAT ABOUT IDEAS RESEARCH 
I PUT IN ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT YEAH MATE WE'VE ALL GOT A STORY LIKE THAT 
WHERE ARE WE 
ONE BRAND NEW SERIES TWO REGULAR CANDIDATES 
I AM A WINNER I AM
