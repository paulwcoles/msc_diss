THESE ARE THE TRAINERS I NEED 
EVERYBODY'S WEARING THEM 
THE NEW ROBBIN HOOD TRAINER 
FOR THE URBAN OUTLAW THAT'S ME 
BUT I CAN'T AFFORD THEM BECAUSE I'M POOR ON ACCOUNT OF HAVING 
MY POCKET MONEY STOPPED BECAUSE I ACCIDENTALLY 
SPILLED SOMETHING ON MUM'S SOFA 
MY BIG BROTHER AND SISTER ON THE OTHER FOOT HAVE LOADS OF MONEY 
MEL CAN BUY HERSELF DIFFERENT CLOTHES EVERY DAY JUST TO IMPRESS 
HER LATEST BOYFRIEND 
TARQUIN HELLAIR 
FAR OUT MAN 
OCH AND A BROAD BRICHT MOONLIT NICHT TO YOU HAMISH 
AND WILLIAM'S SAVING UP TO BUY A MOTORBIKE SO HE'S GOT 
MILLIONS IN HIS WARDROBE NEXT TO HIS SECRET STASH OF MOTORBIKE MAGAZINES 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM 
AND WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT MY MOTORBIKE MAGAZINES 
I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY DO NOT EXIST 
BUT THEY DO NO THEY DON'T COS DAD DOESN'T LIKE MOTORBIKES REMEMBER 
IF YOU RIDE A MOTORBIKE THAT IS WHAT A CAR WILL DO TO YOUR HEAD 
AND TO YOUR ARMS 
AND YOUR EYEBALLS 
NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER BUY A MOTORBIKE 
OR I'LL THROW YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE WITHOUT ANY SANDWICHES 
I DO REMEMBER THAT WE HAD SMOOTHIES FOR A WEEK 
WELL REMEMBER THIS IF I EVER FIND OUT 
THAT YOU'VE TOLD DAD ABOUT ME BUYING A MOTORBIKE I'LL 
YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITH A BANANA 
I CAN MUM WANTS TO SEE YOU DOWNSTAIRS WHY 
IT'S FOR YOU 
IS IT WHAT I THINK IT IS WELL 
OH MUM I LOVE YOU 
I DON'T NORMALLY FEEL GUILTY ALISTAIR BUT ON THIS OCCASION 
I WAS PASSING THAT CHEAP SECOND HAND STALL IN THE MARKET 
AND THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE THEM 
THEY'RE JUST LIKE THE ROBBIN HOOD TRAINERS YOU WANTED AREN'T THEY 
TO BE HONEST ALISTAIR I THOUGHT WHAT IS THE POINT OF SPENDING EIGHTY 
ON TRAINERS YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO GROW OUT OF THESE COST FOUR POINT NINE NINE 
WHY DO MUMS ALWAYS DO THAT 
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS BUY THE WRONG THING COS IT'S CHEAP 
WHAT'S WRONG DON'T YOU LIKE THEM 
NO THEY'RE THE NICEST TRAINERS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE 
LOOK AT THE SHINE OFF THAT PLASTIC 
CAN I TAKE THEM BACK IF THEY DON'T FIT 
I KNEW YOU DIDN'T LIKE THEM THAT IS SO TYPICAL OF YOU ALISTAIR 
I SHOULD BE DREAMING UP PROGRAMME IDEAS FOR THE B. B. C. 
NOT RUSHING AROUND TRYING TO BUY SHOES 
THE B. B. C. ASKED YOU TO MAKE A T. V. PROGRAMME NOT EXACTLY 
THEY WANT ME TO CREATE A NEW IDEA FOR A COOKERY SHOW 
AND THEN MAKE A FIFTEEN MINUTE TAPE 
IT'S ONLY A DEMO BUT AT LEAST SOMEBODY APPRECIATES ME 
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT I BUY YOU ALISTAIR FURY 
THEN IN THE FUTURE YOU CAN JUST BUY IT YOURSELF 
BUT I CAN'T YOU STOPPED MY POCKET MONEY REMEMBER DID WE 
EIGHT MONTHS AGO BUT WE STARTED PAYING THAT AGAIN 
NO DAD I THINK MUM LEFT EXPECTING YOU TO TELL HIM OFF YEAH 
RIGHT UM 
ALISTAIR WHEN YOU GET A PRESENT THAT YOU DON'T LIKE 
YOU SHOULD MAKE SOME EFFORT TO HIDE YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT HOW 
UM WELL LIKE SMILING LIKE THIS 
AAH 
FELLOW REVENGERS THIS REVENGE IS BRILLIANT 
IT PAYS BACK MUM FOR BEING MEAN 
AND GETS ME ROBBIN HOOD TRAINERS AT THE SAME TIME 
EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKS AARON WE GET RID OF THE CHEAP TRAINERS THEN 
WE HAVEN'T WORKED OUT HOW TO DO THAT YET 
COS WE'VE GOT TO MAKE MUM THINK IT WAS AN ACCIDENT 
OR SHE WON'T BELIEVE IT I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT 
SORRY YOU CAN TELL THEM ABOUT ME GOING BAREFOOT 
SO I CUT MY FEET AND LIMP AND SHOW MY BRILLIANT ACTING 
YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN SORRY

PAMELA OH ALISTAIR I'M DESPERATE 
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN HELP ME 
IT'S NOT FUNNY MY HAMSTER SITTER DIDN'T TURN UP 
OH DEAR AND I THOUGHT 
YOU'RE ALWAYS OFFERING TO DO THINGS FOR ME 
SO YOU COULD LOOK AFTER HIM WHILE I'M AWAY 
THAT MEANS YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY ME ANOTHER VISIT TO PICK HIM UP 
IS THAT A PROBLEM NOT FOR ME 
I'M FLYING BACK FROM RIGA ON SUNDAY AFTER THE FINALS 
WHAT IS IT A BEAUTY CONTEST 
CHESS ALISTAIR 
NOW HE'S A VERY RARE RUSSIAN BLUE HAMSTER WORTH NINETY FIVE 
SO HERE'S MY PHONE NUMBER IN CASE HE GETS TOO SAD WHILE I'M AWAY 
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT YOU JUST GAVE ME YOUR PHONE NUMBER 
I HOPE HAMMY'S GOING TO BE SAFE WITH YOU ALISTAIR 
I'LL LOOK AFTER HIM WITH MY LIFE 
GOOD BECAUSE IF HE DIES I WILL NEVER TALK TO YOU AGAIN 
I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN TO THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH 
AND DO THE SAME TO YOU WHAT IF HE DIES OF FLU SAME TO YOU 
RIGHT THAT'S NOT VERY FAIR THOUGH IS IT 
SUPPOSE HE CATCHES HIS LITTLE LEG IN HIS LITTLE WHEEL 
GETS GANGRENE AND DIES OF THAT 
SAME TO YOU 
YOU REALLY LOVE THIS HAMSTER DON'T YOU I DO 
I'M GOING NOW ALISTAIR THANK YOU 
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO MY HOUSE PAMELA 
IF THERE IS A GOD I BET HE'S GOT A LITTLE PINK NOSE AND WHISKERS 
HOW DO YOU MEAN WELL HAMSTERS EAT SHOES DON'T THEY 
SO GET CHEWING 
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT DO THEM 'N ALL 
AREN'T YOU GOING TO HELP 
CAN'T I'VE GOT A SIDE REVENGE PLANNED FOR WILLIAM 
A A A AGH 
WHO WAS SCREAMING WHAT'S HAPPENED 
DISASTER MUMMY

STOP INTERFERING 
WHO'S THAT 
SHE'S GOT A DATE WITH A NEW BOYFRIEND ON SATURDAY A LIBRARIAN 
IF THAT HAMSTER'S JUST EATEN TWO PAIRS OF SHOES

THAT'S ONE ELASTIC HAMSTER YEAH 
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ROUND ME YOU CAN HAVE THESE 
BUT THEY'RE PINK THEY'RE PERFECT 
UNTIL YOU CAN AFFORD YOUR OWN SHOES WEAR THESE ALICE 
SINCE WHEN WAS A HAMSTER CLEVER ENOUGH TO LEAVE A NOTE SAYING 
SORRY I ATE YOUR MOTORBIKE MAGAZINES

LOVE HAMMY THE HAMSTER KISS KISS HMM HMM 
OH HI DAD I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE IN HERE 
CLEARLY 
WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THESE BUY A MOTORBIKE 
SHALL I FETCH A ROLLING PIN AND FRUIT 
OR WILL YOU DEMONSTRATE ON WILLIAM'S HEAD H. M. M. 
OH I SEE YOU THOUGHT I BOUGHT THESE MAGAZINES TO BUY A MOTORBIKE 
SO FAR SO GOOD FELLOW REVENGERS 
ONE TINY HAMSTER HAD CREATED TWO MIGHTY REVENGES 
NOW WATCH HOW EASILY A REVENGE CAN GO WRONG 
WHEN YOU ADD TWO STUPID PARENTS 
NO I BOUGHT THESE MAGAZINES 
BECAUSE I WAS RESEARCHING AN IDEA THAT I'D HAD FOR MUM'S B. B. C. DEMO 
REALLY 
GO ON WILLIAM 
IT'S CALLED CELIA FURY HITS THE ROAD FOR DRIVERS THAT SUDDENLY FEEL 
PECKISH AND ARE MILES AWAY FROM A SERVICE STATION MM HMM BASICALLY 
IT'S ABOUT COOKING STUFF THAT YOU FIND DEAD ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
YOU MEAN ROADKILL 
THAT'S DISGUSTING BUT IS IT THOUGH 
YES BUT ALL THE BEST CHEFS USE THEIR MOTORBIKES TO FIND THEIR 
INGREDIENTS LIKE JAMIE OLIVER AND TWO FAT LADIES AND THE HAIRY BIKERS 
PLUS IT'S GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE RECYCLING THINGS 
THAT'D NORMALLY GO TO WASTE OR TO VULTURES 
I LIKE IT IF YOU'RE LYING WILLIAM I'LL CUT YOUR POCKET MONEY 
HE'S LYING NO HE'S NOT 
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA AND YOU'RE THE LITTLE LIAR 
YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM ALISTAIR I'M ALREADY IN IT

STAY HERE WHILE WILLIAM AND I GO CHOOSE OURSELF A MOTORBIKE YEAH 
SO CAN I HAVE IT WHEN WE'RE FINISHED WITH IT

NOW AS YOU CAN SEE THERE I'VE JUST 
DRAWN UP A SIMPLE LITTLE CHART SHOWING HOW MUCH EACH OF YOU 
HAVE SPENT ON YOUR MUM FOR MOTHER'S DAY 
AND HOW MUCH YOU INTEND TO SPEND ON ME 
NOT THAT I'M IN COMPETITION WITH YOUR MOTHER 
I WOULDN'T WANT ANYTHING MORE THAN HER THAT WOULDN'T BE FAIR

SUGAR MAPLE SYRUP OR A CHEEKY SQUEEZE OF SQUIRREL 
THEY'VE BEEN STEALING MY POCKET MONEY FOR EIGHT MONTHS 
THEY MUST HAVE HAD ABOUT EIGHTY 
THAT'S ENOUGH TO BUY A PAIR OF ROBBIN HOOD TRAINERS 
I'VE NEVER FELT AS ROBBED 
SO WHY DON'T YOU ROB THEM BACK YOU CAN'T DO THAT 
WHY ROBBIN HOOD DID HE ROBBED THE RICH TO GIVE TO THE POOR 
BUT DID HE SPEND IT ON TRENDY TRAINERS 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TRAINERS THEN PROBABLY HAD DESIGNER SANDALS 
IT'S BRILLIANT IT'S NOT ROBBING AT ALL
