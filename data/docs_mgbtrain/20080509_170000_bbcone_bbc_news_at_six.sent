THE BURMESE REGIME REFUSES TO ALLOW 
FOREIGN AID WORKERS IN TO HELP 
THEY THINK PEOPLE ARE VERY 
FRUSTRATED THEY HAVE THE EQUIPMENT 
THEY HAVE THE PEOPLE THEY HAVE 
SUPPLIES MOBILISED FROM ALL OVER 
THE WORLD WHAT THEY NEED IS THE 
ACCESS TO DO THEIR JOBS 
ALSO ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME AFTER 
TWO MEMBERS OF A GANG ARE GIVEN 
LIFE SENTENCES FOR KILLING A SIXTEEN 
YEAR OLD BOY RELATIVES OF THE 
VICTIM EXPRESS THEIR ANGER 
I BELIEVE IN A LIFE FOR A LIFE I 
PLEAD THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO 
SHOWED SO LITTLE REMORSE SERVE THE 
FULL TERM 
A LARGE JUMP IN THE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE FACING EVICTION FROM THEIR 
HOMES MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND IN THE 
FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR 
AND TWO MANAGERS BUT ONLY ONE 
PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE FERGUSON AND 
GRANT SPEAK OUT BEFORE THOSE LAST 
MATCHES 
ON B. B. C. LONDON NEWS DID A GROUP OF 
TEENAGERS CAUSED THE EXPLOSION 
WHICH LEFT ONE MAN DEAD AND HOW 
NEW IMMIGRATION RULES WILL AFFECT 
FOREIGN CARERS AND THE VULNERABLE 
PEOPLE THEY LOOK AFTER 
GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE B. B. C. 
NEWS AT SIX THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT 
HAS TAKEN ACTIVE STEPS TO STOP 
FOREIGN AID GETTING TO ITS PEOPLE 
IT HAS CONFISCATED TWO PLANE LOADS 
OF SUPPLIES BROUGHT IN BY THE 
UNITED NATIONS THE UN IS URGENTLY 
TRYING TO GET THE SUPPLIES RELEASED 
BUT SAYS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE 
BURMESE GOVERNMENT HAVE STALLED AN 
ESTIMATED MILLION AND A HALF PEOPLE 
ARE IN DESPERATE NEED AND AID 
AGENCIES SAY THE DELAY IN ACCEPTING 
HELP IS COSTING LIVES AND MAY 
TRIGGER AN EPIDEMIC OF DISEASE IN 
A MOMENT WE'LL HEAR ABOUT WHAT 
OPTIONS ARE OPEN TO THE AID 
AGENCIES BUT FIRST OUR 
CORRESPONDENT PAUL DANAHAR HAS SENT 
THIS REPORT FROM SOUTHERN BURMA 
SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE CYCLONE STRUCK 
THINGS ARE NOT GETTING MUCH BETTER 
PEOPLE ARE STILL STRANDED IN THE 
IRRAWADDY DELTA LOCAL RED CROSS 
WORKERS TOLD US DISEASES LIKE 
DYSENTERY WERE ALREADY GETTING A 
GRIP AND YET THERE IS STILL NO 
RELIEF EFFORT TO MATCH THE SIZE OF 
THE CATASTROPHE THE CYCLONE CAUSED 
ENORMOUS DESTRUCTION TEARING UP 
HOMES KNOCKING DOWN BRIDGES AND 
BLOCKING ROADS BUT IT DOES NOT 
SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THE MAIN CAUSE OF 
THOSE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DEATHS 
THE TIDAL SURGE FORMED IN THE WAKE 
OF THE CYCLONE WASHED AWAY ENTIRE 
COMMUNITIES HUSBAND AND WIVES 
MOTHERS AND CHILDREN SWEPT A PART 
IN AN INSTANT HAS DONES NOW 
THE SURVIVORS SEARCH FOR THEIR 
LOVED ONES BUT THERE ARE NOT 
ENOUGH PEOPLE TO HELP THEM 
HUSBANDS THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT 
HAS SAID THAT THEY INTEND TO RUN 
THIS RESCUE EFFORT ON THEIR OWN 
AID WAS WELCOME BUT THE PEOPLE AND 
SKILLS TO DELIVER IT WERE NOT WE WE ARE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO 
SAVE LIVES BECAUSE EVERY DELAY IS 
LIVES POTENTIALLY LOST AND 
CERTAINLY AN EPIDEMIC RIGHT ON OUR 
DOORSTEP DOORSTEP BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THAT FAR 
OUT OF THE CAPITAL TO SEE THAT 
DESPITE THEIR EFFORTS THE TASK IS 
JUST TOO BIG FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO 
GO IT ALONE THE DESTRUCTION IS 
OBVIOUS AND SO IS THE FACT THAT 
JUST FEW HOURS FROM RANGOON 
PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THE HELP 
THEY NEED BUT FOR THE TIME BEING 
THE DISCUSSION ON GETTING IN MORE 
AID WORKERS SEEMS TO BE OVER THE 
BURMESE OFFICIALS WHO PROCESS THE 
VISAS HAVE JUST CLOSED THEIR 
OFFICES FOR A THREE DAY HOLIDAY NO 
SUCH LUCK FOR THE MILLION OR MORE 
PEOPLE LOCKED AWAY IN THE FLOODED 
DELTA 
SO NEARLY A WEEK ON FROM THE 
CYCLONE AND WITH THE AID 
OPERATION LARGELY BLOCKED BY 
BURMA'S GENERALS WHAT OPTIONS ARE 
THERE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY BRIAN HANRAHAN IS HERE 
FRUSTRATION IS BUILDING INTO 
OUTRAGE AMONG THE AID AGENCIES 
TRYING TO GET HELP INTO BURMA ON 
THE SCALE THAT IS NEEDED THEY KNOW 
THERE IS GRIM TIME TABLE TO EVERY 
DISASTER FIRST THERE IS THE 
INITIAL DEATH TOLL IN THIS CASE 
ESTIMATED AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE SURVIVORS 
WILL BE LEFT WITHOUT FOOD WATER OR 
SHELTER THE RELIEF WORKERS MUST 
TRY TO SUSTAIN THEM BY DAY THREE 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BASIC 
SUPPLIES MOVING AND TO HAVE 
CREATED DISTRIBUTION NETWORK BUT 
IN BURMA ONE WEEK ON FROM THE 
CYCLONE THERE IS STILL NO 
ESTABLISHED RELIEF OPERATION IT IS 
ESTIMATED ONLY ONE IN TEN PEOPLE ARE 
GETTING ANYTHING PEOPLE WILL 
ALREADY BE DYING BUT AFTER TEN DAYS 
IF NO AID ARRIVES THE NUMBER OF 
DEATHS WILL RISE SHARPLY THAT'S 
WHEN DISEASE PARTICULARLY WERE 
TYPHOID AND DENGUE FEVER BREAK OUT 
AMONG PEOPLE ALREADY WEAKENED BY 
EXPOSURE DEHYDRATION AND 
STARVATION DESPITE THIS THE 
BURMESE GOVERNMENT SHOWS NO SIGN OF 
URGENCY STATE TELEVISION MAKES 
MUCH OF THE MILITARY'S PART IN 
DISTRIBUTING AID WITH AN EMPHASIS 
ON HOW EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL 
BUT THE HUMAN CHANGE UNLOADING THE 
PLANES SHOW HOW ILL EQUIPPED BURMA 
IS HUMAN CHAINS 
THE LONGER THE 
DELAY GOES ON THE PROBLEM GETS 
EXPONENTIALLY WORSE SO IT HAS NOW 
BEEN FIVE OR SIX DAYS SINCE THE 
CYCLONE HIT AND ANY LONGER MORE 
AND MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE THE THE FLOODWATERS HAVE DESTROYED MUCH OF 
THE REGION'S INFRASTRUCTURE 
WITHOUT ROADS OR BRIDGES OR BOATS 
HELICOPTERS ARE THE ONLY WAY TO 
REACH PEOPLE QUICKLY AND BURMA IS 
BELIEVED TO HAVE ONLY ABOUT HALF A 
DOZEN IN WORKING ORDER THE BRITISH 
AMBASSADOR HAS SPOKEN OF HIS FEARS 
OF A FURTHER DRAMATIC ESCALATION IN 
THE DEATH TOLL THE PRIME MINISTER 
SAID IT WAS UTTERLY UNACCEPTABLE 
FOR THE BURMESE MILITARY TO BLOCK 
AID THE LIB DEM LEADERS AT THE 
TIME WAS COMING TO START AIR 
DROPPING SUPPLIES OVER THE 
OBJECTIONS OF THE GENERALS OF OF COURSE IT IS NOT IDEAL TO DROP AID 
FROM THE AIR BECAUSE YOU DO NOT 
KNOW INTO WHOSE HANDS IT FALLS OR 
INDEED WHETHER IT REACHES THE 
INTENDED DESTINATION BUT I DON'T 
THINK ANYTHING COULD BE ANY WORSE 
THAN WHAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT 
THIS GROTESQUE SPECTACLE OF A 
REGIME REFUSING TO HELP SOME OF THE 
MOST VULNERABLE WRETCHED PEOPLE IN 
THAT REGION IF NOT THE WORLD 
THE BURMESE REGIME KEEPS CHANGING 
ITS MIND ABOUT EVEN THE LIMITED 
QUANTITY OF AID IT WILL ACCEPT 
THIS APPROACH SUGGESTS A POWER 
STRUGGLE MAY BE GOING ON WITHIN THE 
RULING JUNTA RIGHT NOW THE 
FACTION THAT IS WINNING IS THE ONE 
THAT DOESN'T MIND HOW MANY PEOPLE 
DIE 
OUR CORRESPONDENT IS IN BANGKOK 
WHERE THE ATTEMPTED AID OPERATION 
IS BEING CO ORDINATED WHAT IS THE 
LATEST LATEST A LOT OF AID WORKERS ARE HAVE BEEN 
SPEAKING TO TONIGHT ARE SPITTING 
NAILS THERE IS I THINK A GROWING 
FEAR HERE THAT FORTRESS BOMBER IS 
SIMPLY NOT GOING TO OPEN ITS DOORS 
IN THE WAY EVERYONE WANTS IT TO 
BURMA WE DO KNOW THAT A COUPLE OF 
UN FLIGHTS ARE GOING TO BE ALLOWED 
IN TOMORROW AND AN AMERICAN 
GOVERNMENT FLIGHT LATER BUT THE 
FEAR IS THAT THE EIGHT ONCE IT 
ARRIVES AT RANGOON AIRPORT MAY END 
UP JUST SITTING ON THE TARMAC THERE 
WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF LADIES 
ALREADY PILING UP THERE BECAUSE 
THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES SIMPLY 
DON'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT TO GET IT 
OUT OF THE DELTA A LOT OF AID 
ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE WE ARE 
HEARING THAT SOME OF THE SMALLER 
AID AGENCIES WHO HAVE BETTER 
RELATIONS AVE THE CHILDREN 
MANAGED TO REACH BY BOAT TODAY 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WERE FEARED DEAD 
THEY ARE IN BAD CONDITION BUT AT 
LEAST THEY'LL LIFE 
THANK YOU 
THE AID AGENCIES ARE APPEALING FOR 
HELP THEY SAY THE NEED THESE 
IMMEDIATE AND FAST THERE ARE FULL 
DETAILS OF HOW TO CONTRIBUTE ON OUR 
WEBSITE 
TODAY'S OTHER NEWS THE SENIOR 
POLICE OFFICER HAS CALLED ON 
PARENTS TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY 
AFTER TEN TEENAGERS A SENIOR 
POLICE OFFICER WERE CONVICTED OF 
THE MURDER OF TWO SCHOOLBOYS THEY 
WERE BOTH STABBED IN SEPARATE 
INCIDENTS BOTH HAD BEEN SET UPON 
BY TEENAGE GANGS 
MANY LEFT FLOWERS AND MESSAGES BUT 
FEW COULD MAKE SENSE OF THE DEATH 
OF A YOUNGSTER WITH SO MUCH TO LIVE 
FOR IN A CONFRONTATION IN 
HAMMERSMITH KODJO AGENDA WAS 
STABBED TO DEATH ANOTHER FACE IN 
THE GROWING CROWD OF TEENAGE 
VICTIMS OF GANG CRIME HUNDREDS 
TOOK TO THE STREETS TO SHOW THEIR 
ANGER AT KODJO'S DEATH KODJO 
YENGA TODAY AFTER SEEING HIS 
KILLERS JAILED HIS MOTHER GAVE HER 
REACTION 
THE MESSAGES KODJO 
WILL NEVER COME HOME AGAIN SO IN 
RESPECT OF THE SENTENCES THE PAIN 
WILL BE WITH HER FOR THE REST OF 
HER LIFE THE BOYS WILL COME OUT IN 
FIFTEEN YEARS AND THEY'LL HAVE ANOTHER 
SIXTY YEARS IN HEAD OF THEM THOSE THOSE KILLERS AHEAD WERE CONVICTED OF 
MURDER AND SENTENCED TO A MINIMUM 
OF FIFTEEN YEARS THREE OTHER TEENAGERS 
WERE JAILED FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS 
FOR MANSLAUGHTER SUCH SENTENCES 
SAID THE JUDGE WERE DESIGNED TO 
SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT THE 
COURTS WERE READY TO TACKLE GANG 
CRIME WHICH IS HE CONSIDERED A 
GROWING SOCIAL PROBLEM 
THEN ANGRY CONFRONTATIONS ANOTHER 
FAMILY A DIFFERENT CASE BUT AGAIN 
A TEENAGE BOY STABBED TO DEATH BY 
AGAIN FOURTEEN YEAR OLD PAUL ERHAHON 
DIED IN WALTHAMSTOW A MONTH AFTER 
KODJO PAUL'S KILLERS WERE TODAY 
JAILED FOR AT LEAST ELEVEN OR THIRTEEN YEARS 
IT WAS ONLY ONE BOY ON EACH 
OCCASION THAT DEALT THAT FATAL BLOW 
BUT THE MESSAGE IS THAT THERE WERE 
FIVE PEOPLE KILLED OF KILLING EACH 
OF THESE BOYS THE MESSAGE IS THAT 
IF YOU GO OUT WITH THE INTENT TO 
ROB SOMEBODY OR INTENDING TO HURT 
PEOPLE THEN LIKE IN THIS CASE 
THE JURY WILL FIND YOU GUILTY IN 
THE SAME WAY AS THE BOY WHO DEALS 
THE FATAL BLOW 
ON INNER CITY 
ESTATES GANGS OFFER THE PROMISE OF 
RESPECT FOR YOUNG BOYS BUT WITH TEN 
YOUTHS NOW STARTING JAIL SENTENCES 
THE COSTS OF GANG LIFE ARE HIGH 
THE AUSTRIAN MAN ACCUSED OF 
IMPRISONING HIS DAUGHTER IN A 
CELLAR AT TWENTY FOUR YEARS MUST BE HELD IN 
CUSTODY FOR ANOTHER MONTH IT IS 
UNDERSTOOD THAT JOSEF FRITZL DID 
NOT SPEAK AT A COURT HEARING IN 
AUSTRIA TODAY THE SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD HAS 
SAID HE KNEW HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS 
WRONG BUT HE COULD NOT STOP 
HIMSELF HIMSELF ANOTHER WORRYING BAROMETER ABOUT 
THE STATE OF THE HOUSING MARKET 
EMERGED TODAY THERE HAS BEEN A 
LARGE JUMP IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES THE 
COURTS ISSUED MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
REPOSSESSION ORDERS IN THE FIRST 
THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR UP SEVENTEEN PER CENT 
ON A YEAR AGO 
IT IS THE DARK SIDE OF THE PROPERTY 
MARKET HOUSES ON AUCTION AFTER 
BEING REPOSSESSED THE END OF A 
PROCESS THAT BEGINS WITH A COURT 
LETTER THROUGH THE POST 
THESE ARE HORRIFYING NUMBERS FOR 
ALL OF THOSE THOUSANDS OF 
HOMEOWNERS FACING REPOSSESSION BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE JUST NOT 
SURPRISING WE HAVE PREDICTED AS 
HAVE MANY OTHER PEOPLE FOR SOME 
TIME NOW THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE ON 
THE RISE 
A IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT 
MORE PEOPLE ARE HAVING TROUBLE 
PAYING THEIR DEBTS TODAY'S FIGURES 
SHOW THAT LENDERS APPLIED FOR OVER 
THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND POSSESSION ORDERS IN THE 
FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR 
THAT IS SIXTEEN PER CENT MORE THAN THE SAME TIME 
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BUT IT IS STRIKING THAT 
THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS HAS BEEN 
GOING UP SHARPLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
THAT WAS LONG BEFORE THE HOUSING 
MARKET GROUND TO A HALT CLEARLY 
LENDERS ARE NOW RESORTING MORE 
QUICKLY TO THE COURTS BUT NOT ALL 
OF THOSE APPLICATIONS WILL BE 
GRANTED ONLY ABOUT ONE IN FOUR 
WILL LEAD TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES BEING 
REPOSSESSED PEOPLE CAN LOSE THEIR 
HOMES BECAUSE OF OTHER DEBTS BUT 
THE NUMBER OF MORTGAGE 
REPOSSESSIONS IS STILL WELL BELOW 
THE HIGHS REACHED IN THE EARLY 
NINETEEN NINETIES 
WE THINK WE WILL SEE ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
REPOSSESSIONS THIS YEAR WHICH IS 
SIGNIFICANT RISE ON LAST YEAR'S 
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND BUT IT STILL REPRESENTS 
FEWER THAN ONE IN THREE HUNDRED BORROWERS SO 
I THINK IT IS A REASONABLE LEVEL OF 
RISK THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT 
MOST PEOPLE CAN AVOID THESE KINDS 
OF PROBLEMS IF THEY TALK TO THEIR 
LENDER EARLY 
THE GOVERNMENT TODAY SAID IT WAS 
GOING TO DO MORE TO HELP 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IN 
ALL THE COUNTY COURTS THAT DEAL 
WITH REPOSSESSION CASES THERE IS 
FREE LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR 
PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK OF LOSING 
THEIR HOME WE HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT 
WE'RE GOING TO STRENGTHEN OUR 
HOUSING ADVICE SERVICE SO THAT MORE 
INFORMATION CAN BE GIVEN TO PEOPLE 
WHO ARE HAVING TO LOOK AT 
REFINANCING THEIR MORTGAGES 
THE OPPOSITION SAID IT WAS TOO 
LITTLE TOO LATE THE HELP MAY COME 
IN HANDY FOR SOME BUT MINISTERS 
CANNOT CHANGE THE BASIC FACT THAT 
BANKS ARE LENDING LESS FREE THAN 
BEFORE AND THEY'RE GETTING MORE 
KEEN TO COLLECT 
PEOPLE HAVE STARTED TO FLEE FROM 
LEBANON AFTER THREE DAYS OF INTENSE 
FIGHTING WHICH HAS LEFT ELEVEN PEOPLE 
DEAD LARGE PARTS OF WEST BEIRUT 
HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER BY GUNMEN 
LOYAL TO THE IRANIAN BACKED GROUP 
HEZBOLLAH THE FOREIGN OFFICE HAS 
WARNED BRITONS NOT TO GO TO THE 
COUNTRY 
IT IS A COUP BY ANY OTHER NAME 
SHI'ITE GUNMEN FROM HEZBOLLAH AND 
ITS OPPOSITION ALLIES HAVE BEEN 
BATTLING IT OUT WITH GOVERNMENT 
SUPPORTERS IN WEST BEIRUT AFTER A 
NIGHT OF GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS IT 
WAS VIRTUALLY ALL OVER NOW HAS 
BULLFIGHTERS CONTROL VIRTUALLY ALL 
OF WEST BEIRUT IT'S A HUGE SHIFT 
IN THE BALANCE OF POWER HERE NOW 
HEZBOLLAH FIGHTERS THE TAKEOVER 
HAS NOT BEEN WELCOMED BY MANY 
THERE HAS BEEN PANIC BUYING OF FOOD 
THERE HAS TO BE 
COMPROMISE SOLUTION WHAT'S 
HAPPENED IS UNACCEPTABLE IT'S LIKE 
BEING UNDER SIEGE 
FOREIGN VISITORS ARE ALSO VOTING 
WITH THEIR FEET PACKING AND 
LEAVING AS THEY DID WHEN ISRAEL 
ATTACKED TWO YEARS AGO THE 
LEBANESE ARMY HAS INTERVENED TO 
PROTECT THE LIVES AND THE HOMES OF 
THE MAIN POLITICIANS WHO SUPPORT 
THE GOVERNMENT HERE BUT THEY HAVE 
DONE NOTHING TO STOP THE TAKEOVER 
OF THE STREETS BY HEZBOLLAH THAT 
HAS LEFT THE GOVERNMENT LOOKING 
EXTREMELY WEAK AND TOOTHLESS THIS 
IS WHERE THE EMBATTLED PRIME 
MINISTER AND MEMBERS OF HIS 
WESTERN BACKED GOVERNMENT ARE HOLED 
UP THEY MAY HAVE WESTERN AND ARAB 
SUPPORT BUT THAT LOOKS THEORETICAL 
RIGHT AND FOR THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
HEZBOLLAH HAS BEEN PHYSICALLY 
BESIEGING THE GOVERNMENT BUILDING 
RIGHT NOW ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IT 
IS CLEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
LOST ITS GRIP 
IT IS SIX FIFTEEN P. M. OUR TOP STORY THE 
BURMESE GOVERNMENT ALLOWS ONLY A 
TRICKLE OF AID INTO THE COUNTRY 
MILLIONS NEED HELP MORE RAIN IS 
FORECAST FORECAST COMING UP ROBERT MUGABE'S PLAN TO 
INTIMIDATE ZIMBABWE'S VOTERS WE 
HAVE A SPECIAL REPORT 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON BREAKING DOWN 
THE WALL OF SILENCE HOW 
TECHNOLOGY IN COURT IS HELPING TO 
CONVICT KILLERS 
WITH BURIAL SPACE AT A PREMIUM IN 
THE CAPITAL WE LOOK AT THE LATEST 
PLACE TO REST IN PEACE 
A FILIPINO MAN WHOSE WIFE WAS 
KILLED BY AN N. H. S. BLUNDER HAS BEEN 
TOLD HE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE BRITAIN 
ARNEL CABRERA WAS ALLOWED INTO THE 
COUNTRY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN HIS 
WIFE BEGAN WORKING IN A BRITISH 
HOSPITAL MAYRA CABRERA DIED THE 
FOLLOWING YEAR WHEN AN EPIDURAL 
DRUG WAS MISTAKENLY INJECTED INTO 
HER ARM RATHER THAN HER SPINAL CORD 
WHILE SHE WAS GIVEN BIRTH DANIEL 
SANDFORD IS HERE TO TELL US ABOUT 
IT WHY IS HE NOT ALLOWED TO STAY 
HIS PROBLEM IS THAT HE WAS ONLY 
ALLOWED TO COME TO BRITAIN BECAUSE 
HIS WIFE WAS WORKING HERE AS A 
NURSE WHEN SHE DIED DURING 
CHILDBIRTH AS THE RESULT OF AN N. H. S. 
MISTAKE HIS RIGHT TO LIVE HERE 
BASICALLY DISAPPEAR HE WAS 
ALLOWED TO STAY ON TO DEAL WITH THE 
AFTERMATH AND WITH THE INQUEST 
WHICH PRODUCED A VERDICT OF 
UNLAWFUL KILLING THE CORONER SAID 
HE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY THE 
HOME OFFICE SHOULD BASICALLY CUT UP 
THE RED TAPE AND THROW IT AWAY IN 
HIS CASE IT WAS DOWN TO THE U. K. 
BORDER AGENCY TO USE ITS DISCRETION 
TO DECIDE WHETHER HE SHOULD BE 
ALLOWED TO LIVE HERE WITH HIS SON 
WHO WAS BORN AT THE TIME THAT HIS 
WIFE DIED BUT IT HAS DECIDED NOT 
TO USE ITS DISCRETION AND SAYS HE 
WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THAT IS THAT 
TODAY ARNEL CABRERA'S LAWYERS SAY 
THAT HIS WIFE HAS BEEN KILLED BY 
ONE BRANCH OF THE STATE AND AS 
RESULT ANOTHER BRANCH OF THE STATE 
HAS TOLD HIM HE HAS TO LEAVE 
BRITAIN BRITAIN B. B. C. NEWS HAS LEARNED OF PLANS TO 
INTIMIDATE VOTERS IF THERE IS A 
SECOND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 
ZIMBABWE THEY ARE PUTTING SO 
CALLED WAR VETERANS IN POLICE 
UNIFORM INSIDE THE POLLING STATIONS 
A POLICE SOURCE HAS TOLD US THAT 
THE VETERANS WHOSE SUPPORT ROBERT 
MUGABE WILL BE INSERTED INTO 
REGULAR UNITS BEFORE THE VOTE TAKES 
PLACE OUR AFRICA CORRESPONDENT 
ORLA GUERIN WENT UNDERCOVER AND 
SENT THIS REPORT 
AT A REMOTE LOCATION DEEP IN THE 
BUSH WE MET AT THIS SERVING POLICE 
OFFICER WHO WANTED TO REVEAL WHAT 
PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS UP HIS SLEEVE 
HE SHOWED US HIS POLICE IDENTITY 
CARD BUT WE CAN'T DISCLOSE HIS 
NAME HE SAYS THE PLANS AT AN 
ADVANCED STAGE AND HE WOULD BE 
RISKING HIS LIFE IF HE TRIED TO 
STOP THE OPERATION 
THE WAR 
VETERANS WILL BE WEARING POLICE 
UNIFORMS THEY WILL BE GIVEN RANKS 
THEY WILL BE PART AND PARCEL OF THE 
POLICE DEPLOYED IN EVERY WARD SO 
WHEN HE WILL COME TO VOTE THEY 
WILL SEE WAR VETERANS FROM THEIR 
AREA IN AMONG THE POLICE AND THEY 
WILL BE INTIMIDATED 
THEY WANTED TO 
CUT OFF MY HANDS ALL OF A SUDDEN 
HE CHANGED AND TOOK THE PART OF MY 
THUMB 
WHEN INTIMIDATION DOESN'T THUMB WORK THERE ARE MUCH TOUGHER 
TACTICS THIS OPPOSITION ACTIVIST 
ESCAPED THE LONG ARM OF THE STATE 
BUT ONLY JUST 
FIRST THEY TRIED TO 
SHOOT ME AND THEIR ONE GUY SAID 
DON'T SHOOT HIM TORTURE HIM OR 
ELSE WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET 
EVIDENCE OUT OF HIM THEN THEY 
STARTED HITTING ME WITH PART OF THE 
GUN AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD CRUSH 
EACH FINGER THEY MANAGED TO CRUSH 
MY ONE FINGER THEN I MANAGED TO 
BREAK AWAY 
DO YOU THINK THEY 
INTENDED TO KILL YOU

DEFINITELY INTENDED TO KILL ME HE HE IS ONE OF A GROWING NUMBER OF N. D. C. 
SUPPORTERS AND ACTIVISTS WHO ARE 
NOW ON THE RUN M. D. C. THEY USUALLY 
HAD FOR THE URBAN AREAS HOPING TO 
DISAPPEAR SOME OF THOSE WHO HAVE 
COME HERE HAVE BEEN SO FRIGHTENED 
THEY WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE 
COUNTRY RIGHT AWAY OTHERS ARE 
LOOKING FOR SOME FOOD SOME HELP 
AND A SAFE PLACE TO HIDE WE ARE ON 
OUR WAY NOW TO MEET A NEW ARRIVAL 
THIS WOMAN IS A COUNCILLOR FROM THE 
M. D. C. SHE RAN FROM HER HOME WITH 
ONLY THE CLOTHES SHE WAS WEARING 
WE FOUND HER IN A CHURCH STILL 
TRAUMATISED SHE TOLD US UNIFORMED 
MEN CAME TO HAND HER DOWN A 
NEIGHBOUR WARNED HER HER NAME WAS

THESE CHILDREN ARE AIDS ORPHANS

HERE THEY BELIEVE IF THERE IS NO 
CHANGE AT THE TOP THERE IS NO HOPE 
EVERYONE WILL DIE SAYS THE WOMAN 
IN CHARGE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO 
DON'T GET ANY FOOD THE PRESIDENT 
DOES NOT CARE 
THE CHILDREN'S SONGS HAVE A SERIOUS 
MESSAGE ABOUT THEIR HUNGER AND 
THEIR NEED FOR HELP AND ABOUT THE 
NEED FOR CHANGE 
THE B. B. C. IS TO MAKE AN ON AIR 
APOLOGY AFTER IT ADMITTED KEEPING 
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FROM PREMIUM 
RATE PHONE INS WHICH SHOULD HAVE 
GONE TO CHARITY VIEWERS OF MAKING 
YOUR MIND UP THE SHOW WHICH CHOSE 
LAST YEAR'S U. K. ENTRY FOR THE 
EUROVISION SONG CONTEST WERE 
ACCIDENTALLY TOLD TO RING WHEN THE 
LINES WERE CLOSED THE MONEY HAS 
BEEN REPAID TO CHARITIES WITH 
INTEREST INTEREST IN A LITTLE UNDER TWO WEEKS THE 
PEOPLE OF CREWE AND NANTWICH GO TO 
THE POLLS IN A BY ELECTION SPARKED 
BY THE RECENT DEATH OF LABOUR M. P. 
GWYNETH DUNWOODY SHE HAD A SEVEN THOUSAND 
MAJORITY IN THE CONSTITUENCY AND 
THE ELECTION WILL BE A FURTHER TEST 
FOR THE GOVERNMENT IN NATIONAL 
OPINION POLL TODAY SUGGESTED THAT 
LABOUR IS LESS POPULAR NOW THAN 
SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AT TWENTY THREE PER CENT COMPARED 
TO THE TORIES' FORTY NINE PER CENT BEN WRIGHT 
REPORTS FROM CREWE 
IF YOU WANT TO GO BOWLING IN CREWE 
HEADS DOWN TO THE LANES ON DUNWOODY 
WAY HEADS DOWN THE FORMER M. P. 
WAS SO WELL LIKED HERE THEY NAMED 
A ROAD AFTER HER NOW THE PARTY 
MACHINES HAVE ROLLED INTO TOWN 
GWYNETH'S DAUGHTER TAMSIN DUNWOODY 
IS LABOUR'S CANDIDATE EDWARD 
TIMPSON IS STANDING FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES AND ELIZABETH 
SHENTON FOR THE LIB DEMS 
LABOUR'S CANDIDATE IS TRYING TO 
KEEP ITS MESSAGE LOCAL IT IS NOT 
EASY 
I AND TEN A MONTH WORSE OFF EASY WITH HIS TEN P. 
IN THAT CASE CAN I 
TAKE YOUR NAME ADDRESS AND 
TELEPHONE NUMBER SO THAT I CAN TAKE 
THE CASE UP 
THERE IS CABINET CLOUT 
HERE TOO IS IT HELPFUL 
THEY HAVE 
COME UP TO HELP A BY ELECTION THE 
PEOPLE OF CREWE AND NANTWICH UP AT 
FIRST BY ME BY THE LABOUR PARTY 
TO CONTINUE THE TRADITION WE HAVE 
HAD OF THIRTY FOUR YEARS OF GOOD SOLID 
CONSTITUENCY WORK A FANTASTIC M. P. 
DAVID CAMERON HAS SAID HIS PARTY 
WILL GIVE THIS BY ELECTION ITS BEST 
SHOT BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE THE 
TORIES WANT TO WIN THE SEAT THEY 
HAVE BROUGHT SOME BIG PLAYERS INTO 
TOWN TO HELP AFTER ALL THIS COULD 
BE THEIR FIRST BY ELECTION GAME 
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AGAIN THE PARTY 
WANTS THIS BY ELECTION TO HAMMER 
HOME THE MESSAGE THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS IN TROUBLE THE 
TORIES' TOP TACTICIAN WANTS TO NAIL 
THEM ON ONE ISSUE IN PARTICULAR 
TEN P. TAX IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT 
ILLUSTRATES THE INCOMPETENCE OF THE 
GOVERNMENT AND HOW OUT OF TOUCH 
THEY ARE WITH THE FEELINGS OF 
ORDINARY PEOPLE 
THE TEN P. TAX IS 
HURTING PEOPLE IN CREWE AND 
NANTWICH IT IS HURTING ALMOST 
TEN THOUSAND FAMILIES WHEN I AM ON THE 
DOORSTEP THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE 
TELLING ME 
THE LIB DEMS WANT TO 
STRIKE HERE TOO 
EVERYONE IS HAPPY 
WITH CANVASSING 
ACTIVISTS HAVE 
COME FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR 
WHAT SOME DESCRIBE AS THE GROUND 
WAR 
THIS IS TURNING INTO A WAR LABOUR SLASH CONSERVATIVE FIGHT ISN'T 
IT 
I CAN'T SAY THAT IT IS THAT IT FROM THE POSITION WE HAVE ON THE 
DOORSTEP WE HAVE VERY STRONG 
SUPPORT OUT THERE IT IS EASY FOR 
US TO WIN THE SEATS EASILY 
ACHIEVABLE 
THIS BY ELECTION COULD ACHIEVABLE SET THE POLITICAL MOOD FOR THE NEXT 
TWO YEARS WHICH IS WHY ALL THE 
PARTIES ARE GOING TO THROW 
EVERYTHING AT IT 
ON TO FOOTBALL AND IT COULD BE 
COULD NOT BE CLOSER AT THE TOP AND 
BOTTOM OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE FANS 
ARE SET FOR A DRAMATIC CLIMAX THIS 
WEEKEND WITH MILLIONS OF POUNDS AS 
WELL AS REPUTATIONS AT STAKE 
THESE ARE THE BEST TEAMS IN ENGLAND 
AND THEY ARE GUIDING THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE TOWARDS A SPECTACULAR FINALE 
ONE GAME TO GO AND BOTH MANCHESTER 
UNITED AND CHELSEA ASPIRE TO WIN 
THE TITLE BOTH SIDES HAD EIGHTY FOUR POINTS 
UNITED HAVE THE EDGE BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE SCORED FIFTY SIX MORE GOALS THAN THEY 
HAVE CONCEDED THIS SEASON 
CHELSEA'S GOAL DIFFERENCE IS JUST 
THIRTY NINE THAT MEANS THAT IF UNITED BEAT 
WIGAN ON SUNDAY THEY WILL BEACHED 
WILL BE CROWNED CHAMPIONS 
HOPEFULLY WE CAN FINISH THE SEASON 
ON A STRONG NOTE THINK WE HAVE 
PUT IN LOTS OF WORK TO PUT 
OURSELVES IN THIS POSITION IT 
WOULD BE GREAT NOT ONLY FOR THE 
PLAYERS BUT FOR THE STAFF AS WELL 
TO HAVE A TITLE TO CELEBRATE THIS THIS IS A CURIOUS TALE OF TWO MANAGERS 
SIR ALEX FERGUSON LAUDED AS A 
UNITED LEGEND CHELSEA'S AVRAM 
GRANT IS STILL UNPOPULAR WITH MANY 
OF HIS FANS BUT NOT WITH SIR ALEX 
CHELSEA'S RECENT FORM HAS BEEN 
COMPELLING THEY ARE UNBEATEN IN TWENTY 
MATCHES 
I THINK WHEN YOU COME TO MATCHES THE LAST MONTH OR TWO MONTHS IT IS 
MENTAL STRENGTH IT IS ALSO A STAR 
QUALITIES AND PHYSICAL OR SO IT 
IS VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU COME TO 
THE LEFT TWO MONTHS TO BE FRESH 
LAST TWO MONTHS 
BUT THE BIGGEST 
BATTLE OF ALL MAY YET BE AMONG 
THOSE WHO HAVE STRUGGLED AT THE 
OTHER END OF THE TABLE THEY ARE 
NOW FIGHTING TO AVOID RELEGATION 
AND THE RICHES OF THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE BOTH FULHAM AND READING 
WILL START THE DAY AND THIRTY THREE POINTS 
BIRMINGHAM HAVE THIRTY TWO ONLY ONE OF 
THIS TRIO WILL AVOID THE DROP I I HAVE 
THE BELIEF L. HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE BELIEF IN MY SQUAD OF PLAYERS 
SOMETHING INSIDE ME TELLS ME IT 
WILL BE ALL RIGHT L. CAN'T 
GUARANTEE THAT 
AS FOR THE LEADERS 
IT IS FORTY YEARS SINCE THE TITLE RACE 
WAS AS CLOSE MANCHESTER UNITED 
WERE IN THE RUNNING BACK THEM AS 
WELL AND LOST THE TITLE ON THE 
LAST DAY THAT DESIRE THAN OMINOUS 
OMEN OR PERHAPS A SPUR TO MAKE 
AMENDS THAT IS EITHER AN OMINOUS 
WILL THE GLORIOUS WEATHER CONTINUE 
THE PICNIC BASKETS WILL BE PULLED 
OUT OF THE CUPBOARD AND THE 
BARBECUES ARE MORE THAN LIKELY A 
GOOD LOOKING WEEKEND FOR MANY OF US 
IT SHOULD BE MAINLY DRY AND WARM 
TONIGHT SOME OF US MAY EVEN HAVE 
THE ODD FAN GOING IN THE BEDROOM 
NOTICE THIS STRIP OF CLOUD THIS 
WEATHER FRONT RIGHT ACROSS THE 
BRITISH ISLES THERE IS A SEARCH OF 
MOISTURE COMING IN THERE WILL BE 
THE ODD RUMBLE OF THUNDER BEFORE 
THEY DIE AWAY STILL SOME LEFT OVER 
WITH US BY THE END OF THE NIGHT IN 
PARTS OF WEST WALES NORTH EAST 
SCOTLAND A MUGGY NIGHT 
TEMPERATURES BARELY DROPPING AWAY 
THESE ARE THE LOWEST TEMPERATURES 
BY THE MORNING A FAIRLY MUGGY AIR 
WE START THE DAY WITH SOME WET 
WEATHER OVER SOUTH WALES AND MAYBE 
NORTH EAST SCOTLAND WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE SITTING TO OUR EAST THE 
FLOW OF THE CONTINENT BUBBLES UP A 
FEW SHOWERS WHICH WILL BE HIT AND 
MISS IF ANYTHING LET'S TAKE WALES 
TWENTY THREE FOR CARDIFF AND A GOOD DEAL OF 
SUNNY SPELLS NORTHERN IRELAND 
MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOUD 
SEVENTEEN FOR BELFAST PARTS OF SCOTLAND 
SHOULD NOT BE TOO BAD 
ABERDEENSHIRE COULD SEE SOME 
SHOWERS AND MAY BE OVER THE 
BORDERS ALSO SOME DRIER WEATHER 
MAKES THEM TWENTY FOUR NEWCASTLE SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN 
TYPICAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR 
TEMPERATURE OF TWENTY FOUR NEWCASTLE 
TEMPERATURES ON THE BRIGHTER SKIES 
DOING WELL TWENTY SEVEN FOR LONDON VERY 
WARM TO SAY THE LEAST TWENTY FOUR FOR 
SOUTHAMPTON A GOOD DEAL OF 
SUNSHINE OF THE SOUTH WEST PARTS OF 
ENGLAND WARM AIR FEEDING IN THERE 
IS THE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
BRINGING IN THAT FORMAT IF 
ANYTHING COME SUNDAY WITH DRIER 
AIR COMING IN FROM THE CONTINENT 
LESS IN THE WAY IT SHOWERS PERHAPS 
MORE IN NORTHERN BRITAIN LOOK AT 
THE TEMPERATURES AGAIN 
I THINK THE BARBECUES ARE IN ORDER 
I CAN'T WAIT 
THE HEADLINES THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT HAS STOPPED AID TO THE 
DISASTER ZONE AS IT HAS IMPOUNDED 
SUPPLIES BROUGHT IN ON TWO UN
