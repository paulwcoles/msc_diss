GOOD AFTERNOON UNIONS AND 
MANAGEMENT AT THE GRANGEMOUTH OIL 
REFINERY ARE HOLDING LAST MINUTE 
TALKS AS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WORKERS PREPARE TO 
GO ON STRIKE IN A DISPUTE OVER 
PENSIONS B. P. HAS CONFIRMED THAT 
IT'S TO SHUT DOWN A PIPELINE 
DELIVERING ALMOST A THIRD OF THE 
U. K.'S OIL PRODUCTION WHICH RELIES ON 
POWER FROM THE GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY 
OUR SCOTLAND CORRESPONDENT ANDREW 
CASSELL REPORTS AT THE 
GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY ALL PRODUCTION 
HAS STOPPED THE PLANT IS ON HOT 
STANDBY WHICH IS UNION CLAIMS 
SHOULD MEAN THEY CAN GETS IT UP AND 
RUNNING WITHIN A FEW DAYS RATHER 
THAN WEEKS AFTER THE STRIKE AROUND 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY WORKER ALSO REMAIN AT THEIR 
POSTS DURING THE STOPPAGE FOR 
SAFETY REASONS BUT THE UNION SAYS 
THEY ARE VOLUNTEERS WHO WON'T BE 
PAID TALKS ARE CONTINUING BEHIND 
THE SCENES BUT THESE APPEAR TO BE 
CENTRED ON HOW TO MANAGE THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS IN PARTICULAR THERE'S NO 
REPRIEVE FOR B. P.'S ADJACENT PLANT 
WHICH OPERATES THE MAIN OIL 
PIPELINE FROM THE NORTH SEA THE 
COMPANY HAS CONFIRMED IT WILL BE 
SHUT DOWN OVERNIGHT EVEN SO 
MINISTERS CONTINUE TO INSIST THERE 
IS NO IMMINENT FUEL CRISIS THERE'S THERE'S ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF PETROL AND 
DIESEL IN SCOTLAND TO TAKE US 
THROUGH THIS PERIOD AND BEYOND WE 
HAVE BEEN BUILDING UP SUPPLIES IN 
SCOTLAND SINCE WE KNEW THIS DISPUTE 
WAS LIKELY TO HAPPEN THE MESSAGE 
FOR EVERYONE IN SCOTLAND IS THERE 
IS ENOUGH PETROL AND DIESEL THERE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT SOME GARAGE 
FORECOURTS ARE EXPERIENCING 
SHORTAGES MOTORISTS COMPLAIN OF 
ERATTIC SUPPLIES AND ISOLATED CASES 
OF PANIC BUYING BUT SO FAR LONG 
QUEUES AT PETROL STATIONS HAVE FAIL 
TO DO MATERIALISE ANDREW JOINS ME 
LIVE SO LITTLE HOPE OF AVERTING 
THIS STRIKE 
VERY LITTLE HOPE 
INDEED THOSE TALKS HAVE NOW 
FINISHED THEY ENDED A FEW MINUTES 
AGO THOSE TALKS WERE CENTRED ON 
HOW TO RUN DOWN THIS PLANT OR KEEP 
IT IN A HOT STATE THERE WAS NO 
TALK OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THE 
SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE OF PENSIONS THAT 
WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE 
STRIKE SO THE STRIKE GOES AHEAD 
AS WE HAVE HEARD MINISTERS SAY 
THERE IS ENOUGH FUEL IN THE SYSTEM 
SO WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER TA MASS WALKOUT 
FORM MORNING

PUPPY DIED YESTERDAY BUT HAD 
ALREADY BITTEN THREE PEOPLE CONNECT 
TO DO THE KENNELS THE OTHER FOUR 
ARE HAVING TESTS RAINIES IS A 
FATAL DISEASE UNTREATED BUT THE 
LAST PERSON TO DIE WAS MORE THAN A 
CENTURY AGO THE THREE PEOPLE BIT

THE POINT OF QUARANTINE IS EARLIER TO WATCH THEM THE DISEASE CAN 
INCUBATE QUITE A LONG PERIOD CAN 
GO BY BEFORE THE ANIMAL FALLS ILL 
NO TEST CAN BE DONE TO DETERMINE 
WHICH ONE IS INCUBATING THE VIRUS 
DOCTORS SAY THE FACT THE DOG DIED

PICTURE REVEALS THE TRUTH A LOT OF 
CLOUD ACROSS SCOTLAND PARTS OF 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE WEST OF 
THE U. K. WE'VE HAD RAIN IN PARTS OF 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND 
THAT'S SHIFTING INTO NORTHERN 
ENGLAND THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE 
FORECAST FOR THE FOOTBALL ACROSS 
PARTS OF THE NORTH EAST SOME RAIN 
AROUND NOT BAD FOR THE MIDLANDS 
THE BEST OF THE WEATHER RESERVED 
FOR THE SOUTH WEST OF THE U. K. WHERE 
HIGHS COULD REACH TWENTY TWO DEGREES IN THE 
CAPITAL WHEREVER YOU TODAY IN THE 
SOUTH MAKE THE MOST OF THE WEATHER 
TOMORROW WILL BE A VERY DIFFERENT 
DAY THE NORTH OF THE COUNTRY HAS 
THE CLOUD AND THE OUTBREAKS OF RAIN 
COMING AND GOING SPOILING THE DAY 
AT LEAST THE WEATHER'S IMPROVED 
ACROSS SCOTLAND THAT'S GOOD NEWS 
MUCH BETTER WEATHER DEVELOPING 
ACROSS THE WEST OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
THE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND NOT LOOKING BAD 
BUT THE CLOUD AND RAIN CONTINUES IN 
IRISH SEA COASTS CAPITAL OF WALES 
WILL SEE SUNSHINE FOR MOST OF THE 
DAY TEMPERATURES UP TO SIXTEEN FOURTEEN FOR 
PLYMOUTH STILL NOT BAD IF YOU GET 
THE SUNSHINE INTO THE EVENING 
HOURS THAT AREA OF RAIN ACROSS THE 
NORTH AND WEST OF THE U. K. WILL SHIFT 
FURTHER EAST AND SOUTH SO TONIGHT 
WILL TURN DAMP ACROSS MOST OF 
ENGLAND AND WALES THE VERY FAR 
NORTH OF THE COUNTRY WILL BE CLEAR

TEMPERATURES AROUND FOUR DEGREES 
TOMORROW MORNING FAIRLY FRESH AND 
SUNNY IN THE NORTH LOOK AT THE 
CONTRAST IN THE WEATHER TORMENT 
ACROSS ENGLAND IT WILL BE RAINING 
IN BIRMINGHAM THE ONLY PLACE WHERE 
WE MIGHT GOOD GUARANTEE THE DRIER 
WEATHER AND POSSIBLY GOOD SUNSHINE 
IS THE EXTREME SOUTH EAST BUT THE 
SOUTHERN COASTS LATER IN THE DAY 
WILL PROBABLY IMPROVE 
WE'LL PROBABLY SEE RAIN FOR THE 
FOOTBALL MATCH EVERTON VERSUS ASTON 
VILLA IN PORTSMOUTH ALTHOUGH IT 
MIGHT BE DRY THERE IS THE CHANCE 
OF RAINFALL MONDAY THE UNSETTLED 
THEME CONTINUES WE HAVE SHOWERS 
DOTTED ACROSS THE U. K. A FAIR OLD 
BREEZE AS WELL TEMPERATURES PEGGED 
BACK DOWN IF YOU ARE WONDERING
