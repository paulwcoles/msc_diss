THIS POSTCARD FEATURES THE SEVERN THE LONGEST RIVER IN BRITAIN 
EACH PICTURE TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE RIVER 
AND EACH PICTURE HAS THE ANSWER TO A QUESTION 
TO FIND OUT LET'S START AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER 
HERE THE RIVER IS JUST A FEW MILES FROM THE SEA 
AND IT'S MORE THAN FIVE KILOMETRES WIDE 
ACROSS THIS WIDE PART OF THE RIVER 
A GREAT NEW BRIDGE WAS BUILT IN JUNE NINETEEN NINETY SIX 
IT'S THE LONGEST BRIDGE IN BRITAIN 
CROSSING THE LONGEST RIVER IN BRITAIN 
AND HERE WE ARE RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BRIDGE 
YOU CAN HEAR THE TRAFFIC OVERHEAD 
WE'RE SURROUNDED BY MILLIONS OF LITRES OF WATER 
BENEATH ME THE RIVER'S OVER TWENTY METRES DEEP 
BUT HOW DID THE WATER GET HERE AND WHERE DOES IT COME FROM 
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS AWAY TO THE NORTH WEST IN THE MIDDLE OF WALES 
HERE WE'RE MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED METRES THAT'S AROUND TWO THOUSAND FEET 
ABOVE SEA LEVEL IN THE CAMBRIAN MOUNTAINS 
THIS IS THE SOURCE OF THE RIVER SEVERN 
THERE'S A POST IN THE GROUND TO PROVE IT 
IT'S WHERE THE RIVER STARTS 
THE FIRST SIGN OF THE SEVERN IS THIS BOGGY POOL 
HERE WATER IS JUST OOZING OUT OF THE GROUND 
BUT WHERE DOES THE WATER COME FROM 
ALL THE RAIN THAT FALLS ON THESE WELSH HILLS SOAKS INTO THE GROUND 
AND FORMS THIS BOG WITH ITS PONDS PUDDLES DRIBBLES AND TRICKLES 
QUICKLY THE DRIBBLES AND TRICKLES COMBINE TO MAKE A LITTLE STREAM 
THAT FLOWS OUT OF THE BOGGY POOL 
THE RIVER SEVERN IS BORN AND BEGINS ITS LONG JOURNEY TOWARDS THE SEA 
FROM HERE THE RIVER SEVERN WILL TRAVEL FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY KILOMETRES 
THAT'S TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILES 
IT STARTS HERE IN WALES 
AND FLOWS IN A LOOP THROUGH ENGLAND 
BEFORE IT EVENTUALLY REACHES THE SEA 
THIS IS THE RIVER SEVERN'S FIRST WATERFALL 
THE WATER CAN'T EASILY WEAR DOWN THIS SHELF OF HARD ROCK 
SO IT JUST POURS OVER THE TOP OF IT 
THIS STEEP FAST FLOWING SECTION 
WHERE THE RIVER CUTS ITS V. SHAPED VALLEY 
IS KNOWN AS THE UPPER COURSE OF A RIVER 
THE MIDDLE COURSE IS LESS STEEP AND THE RIVER VALLEY IS WIDER 
THIS IS WHAT THE MIDDLE COURSE OF THE SEVERN LOOKS LIKE FROM THE AIR 
THE RIVER VALLEY IS INDEED GETTING WIDER 
THE VALLEY FLOOR IS GETTING FLATTER 
THE RIVER IS BEGINNING TO WANDER AND MEANDER FROM SIDE TO SIDE 
IN ITS WIDE VALLEY 
IN FACT A BEND LIKE THIS IN A RIVER IS CALLED A MEANDER 
THE COURSE OF THE RIVER SEVERN IS CHANGING ALL THE TIME 
BUT IT STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO TO THE SEA 
TURNING EASTWARDS OUT OF WALES THEN SOUTH THROUGH ENGLAND 
HERE THE RIVER'S GETTING WIDER AND IT'S CARRYING MORE WATER 
IT'S ALSO CARRYING MORE EARTH AND SAND ERODED FROM ITS BANKS 
ITS MEANDERS ARE GETTING BIGGER AS IT TRIES TO FIND ITS WAY TO THE SEA 
THE RIVER VALLEY IS NOW VERY WIDE 
WITH A LARGE AREA OF FLAT LAND ON EITHER SIDE 
WE'RE NOW MOVING INTO THE RIVER'S LOWER COURSE 
HERE THE SEVERN AND ITS VALLEY ARE GETTING EVEN WIDER 
AND THE WATER IS EVEN MORE SANDY 
OVER THE YEARS SETTLEMENTS HAVE GROWN UP ALONG THE SEVERN 
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO LIVE AND WORK 
SHREWSBURY IS BUILT ON A HILL 
WITH THE GREAT LOOP OF THE RIVER SEVERN GOING RIGHT ROUND IT 
SHREWSBURY CASTLE GUARDED THE NARROW ENTRANCE TO THE TOWN FROM THE LAND 
WHILE THE LOOP OF THE RIVER PROTECTED THE REST OF THE TOWN 
SHREWSBURY'S BEEN ON THIS SITE FOR A LONG TIME 
SHREWSBURY IS NOW A LARGE MODERN TOWN 
BUT NOTHING IS BUILT NEAR THE RIVER 
THIS IS BECAUSE THE FLAT LAND ALONG THE RIVER IS THE FLOOD PLAIN 
AND IT FLOODS EVERY TIME THE RIVER OVERFLOWS 
THAT'S SOMETHING IT DOES EVERY FEW YEARS 
COVERING THE RIVERSIDE FOOTPATHS AND GARDENS 
IT HAPPENS IN THE WINTER WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF RAIN IN WALES 
IT WOULD BE SILLY TO BUILD ANYTHING TOO CLOSE TO THIS 
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR WHEN THE RIVER IS AT ITS NORMAL LEVEL 
THE PEOPLE OF SHREWSBURY HAVE LOTS OF OPEN SPACES NEAR THE TOWN CENTRE 
THAT THEY CAN ENJOY 
ON ONE WEEKEND IN SPRING 
SOMETHING SPECIAL HAPPENS ON THESE RIVERSIDE FIELDS 
RIGHT ON THE BANKS OF THE SEVERN IS THE ANNUAL SHROPSHIRE AND WEST MIDLANDS SHOW 
FARMERS FROM MILES AROUND BRING THEIR ANIMALS HERE TO COMPETE 
AND FARMERS' SONS 
DEMONSTRATED BY DEMO DAVE AS HE'S KNOWN 
IT'S A CHANCE TO SHOW OFF THE LATEST FARM MACHINERY 
AND SOME OF THE EARLIEST 
IN WINTER THIS FIELD WILL BE SEVERAL FEET UNDER WATER 
HERE THE RIVER SEVERN IS JOINED BY THE RIVER AVON 
IT'S A BIT LIKE A MOTORWAY JUNCTION FOR RIVERS 
RIGHT BY THE RIVER IS HEALING'S GRAIN MILL 
THE START OF THE NEXT STAGE OF OUR JOURNEY 
WE'RE GOING DOWN RIVER WITH CHRIS WITTS TO COLLECT SOME MORE GRAIN 
HI CHRIS HI VANESSA READY FOR THE OFF RIGHT FIRE HER UP O. K. 
SO WE LEAVE THE MILL AT TEWKESBURY AND SET OFF TOWARDS THE SEA 
CHRIS WHAT KIND OF BARGE IS THIS SHE'S NOW A GRAIN BARGE 
BUT SHE WAS BUILT TO CARRY COAL ON THE RIVER TRENT 
BUILT IN YORKSHIRE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR HOW LONG IS SHE 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOOT 
AND HOW MUCH CAN SHE CARRY WE CARRY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TONS OF GRAIN 
WHAT WOULD THAT BE IN TERMS OF LORRIES 
THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO TEN BIG LORRIES WOW 
UP UNTIL THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THERE WERE LOTS OF BARGES LIKE THIS ON THE SEVERN 
THEY CARRIED ALL KINDS OF THINGS 
LIKE FUEL OIL AND TIMBER 
BUT THAT'S NOW ALL CARRIED BY ROAD 
NOW THE SEVERN IS MAINLY USED BY PLEASURE BOATS 
WE'RE NOW APPROACHING THE CITY OF GLOUCESTER 
HERE WE LEAVE THE RIVER SEVERN TO GO INTO GLOUCESTER DOCKS 
FROM GLOUCESTER 
OUR JOURNEY TOWARDS THE SEA CONTINUES ON THIS CANAL 
IT WAS BUILT TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND IS CALLED THE SHARPNESS CANAL 
THIS CANAL WAS BUILT TO AVOID THE GREAT TIDAL BENDS OF THE SEVERN 
WITH THEIR SHIFTING SANDBANKS 
FOR NEARLY THIRTY KILOMETRES 
THE RIVER AND THE CANAL TRAVEL TOGETHER TOWARDS THE SEA 
THERE'S ANOTHER USE OF WATER IN THIS HUGE BUILDING RIGHT BY THE RIVER 
THIS IS THE POWER STATION AT IRONBRIDGE 
IT BURNS COAL AND MAKES ELECTRICITY 
BUT AS WELL AS COAL IT NEEDS A VAST QUANTITY OF WATER 
IT GETS THAT FROM THE RIVER SEVERN 
IN IT GOES TO THE POWER STATION THROUGH THIS METAL GRILLE 
THERE'S THE WATER BEING SUCKED OUT OF THE RIVER AND INTO THE WORKS 
OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION LITRES EVERY DAY 
IN FACT AS MUCH RIVER WATER FLOWS THROUGH THIS BUILDING 
AS GOES STRAIGHT ON DOWN THE RIVER 
THIS IS THE GIANT TURBINE HALL 
THE FIRST THING THEY USE RIVER WATER FOR IS HEATED UP TO MAKE STEAM 
THE STEAM THEN DRIVES THE TURBINES THAT MAKE THE ELECTRICITY 
BUT ONCE THE WATER'S DONE ITS JOB 
IT BECOMES HOT AND HAS TO BE COOLED DOWN ITSELF 
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE MASSIVE COOLING TOWERS 
THE WARM WATER THAT'S COOLED ALL THE EQUIPMENT 
FALLS DOWN THROUGH THE AIR LIKE RAIN 
THIS COOLS IT DOWN 
JENNY TOOK ME TO HAVE A LOOK INSIDE ONE OF THE COOLING TOWERS' 
WOW 
SOME OF THE WATER TURNS INTO A FINE MIST 
THAT RISES UP INSIDE THE TOWER 
IT COMES OUT OF THE TOP LIKE HOME MADE CLOUDS 
AND THIRTY MILLION LITRES OF RIVER SEVERN WATER 
BLOW AWAY ON THE BREEZE 
BUT MOST OF THE WATER THAT FALLS THROUGH THE TOWERS 
IS PUMPED ROUND AND USED AGAIN OR PUT BACK INTO THE RIVER 
THE WATER IN LAKE CLYWEDOG PILES UP BEHIND THIS GREAT CONCRETE DAM 
IT WAS BUILT IN THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES ACROSS A TRIBUTARY OF THE SEVERN 
MOST OF THE YEAR THE LAKE JUST SITS HERE 
HELD BACK BY THE DAM AND SLOWLY FILLING UP WHEN IT RAINS 
BUT IN THE SUMMER WHEN THE LEVEL OF THE SEVERN GETS TOO LOW 
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS 
CONTROL ROOM 
A CALL FROM THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY CONTROL ROOM GIVES THE ORDER TO LET OUT MORE WATER 
MAKE AN INCREASE OF ONE HUNDRED PLEASE FROM ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
O. K. ROGER I'LL START DISCHARGING NOW 
A GREAT JET OF WATER IS RELEASED THROUGH THE DAM WALL 
AND AWAY IT GOES TO TOP UP THE RIVER SEVERN 
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S TOO MUCH WATER FLOWING IN THE SEVERN 
DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF RAIN IN THE HILLS 
THE WATER HERE CAN BE HIGHER OR LOWER 
IN SUMMER THE WATER LEVEL IS RIGHT DOWN THERE 
BUT YOU CAN SEE JUST HOW HIGH IT CAN GET 
WHEN THERE'S HEAVY RAIN UP IN THE MOUNTAINS AND LOTS OF WATER 
AFTER HEAVY RAIN THE RIVER SEVERN GETS MORE AND MORE FULL OF WATER 
EVENTUALLY IT OVERFLOWS 
IN MANY PLACES THAT DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH 
BECAUSE WATER JUST SPREADS OVER THE FIELDS LIKE IT HAS FOR YEARS 
THE PROBLEMS START WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE AND HOUSES NEAR THE RIVER 
THIS IS NEWTOWN IN MID WALES 
MANY TIMES IN THE PAST THE RIVER SEVERN HAS FLOODED THE TOWN 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR WATER SWEPT DOWN THE MAIN STREET AND THROUGH THE SHOPS 
THIS IS THE HIGH STREET NOW 
AND THIS IS HOW IT WAS IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR 
SO THEY'VE BUILT WALLS AND EMBANKMENTS ALONG THE RIVER 
TO STOP IT OVERFLOWING 
ALTHOUGH BUILDING FLOOD WALLS PROTECTS NEWTOWN 
IT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS BY SENDING THE WATER ON TO FLOOD ELSEWHERE 
HERE THE SEVERN FLOWS THROUGH OPEN COUNTRY 
YOU CAN'T BUILD WALLS HERE 
WHAT PEOPLE HAVE DONE FOR CENTURIES IS BUILD EARTH BANKS NEAR THE RIVER 
SO IT CAN OVERFLOW SO FAR BUT NO FURTHER 
SO THE WATER HAS SOMEWHERE TO GO FLOODING FIELDS BUT NOT PROPERTY 
IN SOME PLACES ON THE SEVERN ESTUARY 
THEY'VE BUILT STONE FLOOD DEFENCES 
TO PROTECT VILLAGES AGAINST TIDAL STORMS 
IN OTHER PLACES THE RIVER'S ALLOWED TO WEAR AWAY THE BANKS 
BECAUSE NO HOUSES ARE IN DANGER JUST FIELDS 
YOU CAN'T PROTECT EVERYWHERE
