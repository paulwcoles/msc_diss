GOOD POINT FOR US TO START OUR 
INQUIRIES WE HAVE A THAT SIGHTING 
AND IT'S DEFINITE PLACE IN TIME 
ANDREW COMES FROM A LARGE FAMILY IN 
HULL 
THERE IS ME AND FIVE BROTHER 
INCLUDING ANDREW HE IS THE ELDEST 
OUT OF US ALL HE IS THIRTY FOUR NOW L. AM 
TWENTY TWO IT'S QUITE A BIG GAP BUT WE 
WAS QUITE CLOSE 
AFTER HIS MARRIAGE 
COLLAPSES IN HIS TWENTY ANDREW STARTS 
TO DEVELOP A DRINK PROBLEM 
THERE WAS TIMES LIKE MOST MEN THEY 
LIKE TO GO OFF FOR A PINT MAYBE 
ONCE OR TWICE HE WOULD HAVE ONE TOO 
MANY PINTS TO ME THIS IS HOW IT 
STARTED ON ROLLEST COASTER ONLY 
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IT TOOK 
A WHILE 
BY TWO THOUSAND FIVE ANDREW IS LOSING 
CONTROL OF HIS LIFE 
I HAD A LOT OF 
CONTACT WITH THE BROTHERS AND THEY 
WERE TELLING ME THAT ANDREW SEEMED 
TO BE DRINKING MORE THEY DIDN'T 
KNOW WHY THEY SAID IT'S NOT ANDY 
HE IS OUT THERE AND MIXING WITH 
SOME OF THE STREET PEOPLE ANDREW ANDREW STARTS SLEEPING ROUGH AROUND HULL 
HIS FAMILY WANT TO HELP BUT THEY 
ARE FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO CONTACT 
HIM HIM WE HAD SEEN HIM OVER CHRISTMAS AND 
THEN JANUARY IT WAS JUST I DON'T 
KNOW IT WAS LIKE WE USED TO SEE 
HIM AT LEAST ONCE WEEK OR TWICE A 
WEEK FOR LIKE A WEEK WE NEVER SAW 
HIM 
AFTER HEARING NOTHING FOR A HIM FORTNIGHT THE FAMILY REPORT ANDREW 
MISSING 
THE INVESTIGATION INTO HIS 
DISAPPEARANCE HAS NOW BEEN GOING ON 
FOR NINE MONTHS D. C. JASON CO OPER 
IS HEADING TO A SOUP KITCHEN THAT 
ANDREW IS KNOWN TO HAVE USED 
ANDY WAS I WOULD SAY FOR A PERIOD 
OF SIX MONTHS WAS A REGULAR VISITOR 
ONCE OR TWICE WEEK AVERAGE GUY 
NICE MAN BUT OBVIOUSLY HE WAS 
HURTING FROM WHATEVER REASON 
THINGS IN THE PAST HE WAS IN PAIN 
HE WAS STRUGGLING 
DID HE FREQUENT 
WITH ANYONE WHO CAME TO YOUR SOUP 
KITCHEN 
HE WAS PAL WHICH WITH A KITCHEN NUMBER OF THE GUYS OFTEN THEY ARE 
THEY ARE LIKE A COMMUNITY 
DO YOU RECALL HAVING SEEN HIM SINCE 
THE TWENTY SIXTH OF JANUARY 
NOT AT ALL NO 
JASON COOPER HAS BEEN MAKING 
REGULAR VISITS TO AREAS IN THE CITY 
USED BY STREET SLEEPERS 
THIS IS THE AREA UNDER THE BRIDGE 
WE KNEW THAT ANDREW FREQUENTED ON A 
REGULAR BASIS A FEW MONTH AGO IT 
WAS A POPULAR POINT WHERE THE 
HOMELESS PEOPLE WOULD CAMP OUT AND 
YOU WOULD FIND A NUMBER OF TENTS UP 
THE THERE BRAISIERS WHERE THEY 
WERE LIGHTING FIRE TO KEEP 
THEMSELVES WORK EVEN COOKING FOOD 
UNDERTHERE TO SOME PEOPLE IT WAS 
ACTUALLY THEIR HOME ANDREW'S ANDREW'S FAMILY HAVE NOW BEEN WAITING FIFTEEN 
MONTHS FOR NEWS 
IT IS HARD FOR EVERYBODY I THINK 
WE JUST HOPE ONE DAY HE WILL KNOCK 
ON THE DOOR 
I GET UP IN THE 
MORNING AND MY FIRST THOUGHTS IS 
WILL WE HAVE ANDREW TODAY WILL HE 
COME KNOCKING 
THE AGONY IS NOT KNOWING THAT IS 
THE WORST BIT NOT KNOWING JUST JUST GIVE US A MESSAGE THAT HE IS FINE 
THAT'S WHAT COUNTS MORE THAN 
ANYTHING HIS SAFETY AND HIS 
WELLBEING 
JOINING ME NOW IS HUMBERSIDE POLICE 
DETECTIVE JASON COOPER WHO WITH HE 
SAW INVESTIGATING ANDREW'S CASE 
WHAT WE KNOW FROM ANDREW IS HE IS 
OF NO FIX ABODE INVESTIGATING 
SOMEONE WITH THAT STATUS THAT MUST 
BE DIFFICULT FOR YOU IS THAT 
SOMETHING HAVE YOU HAD A LOT OF 
NOT IN MY EXPERIENCE IT ISN'T IT 
THROWS CHALLENGES WE WOULDN'T 
NORMALLY HAVE WITH SUN WHO HAS 
FIXED ABODE WE DON'T HAVE A 
DEFINED STARTING POINT FOR THE 
INQUIRY 
I UNDERSTAND THERE HAVE INQUIRY BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES FOR EXAMPLE 
IN HULL ITSELF IN THE CITY CENTRE 
WHICH MAY HAVE MOVED THE HOMELESS 
PEOPLE ALONG WITH THE REGENERATION 
SO I GUESS THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM 
THAT'S RIGHT THE HOMELESS PEOPLE 
IN HULL CITY CENTRE TEND TO 
FREQUENT THE SAME FAMILIAR PLACES 
SINCE ANDREW DISAPPEARED LAST YEAR 
THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE CITY CENTRE 
HAS CHANGED AND THERE ARE NOW 
PLACES THAT THEY FREQUENT THEY 
DIDN'T YEAR AGO CONVERSELY 
PLACES HAVE SINCE DISAPPEARED HOW HOW HELPFUL HAVE THEY BEEN TO YOU THE 
OTHER HOMELESS PEOPLE 
THEY'VE HAVE 
BEEN VERY HELPFUL THEY'VE BEEN 
DIFFICULT TO TRACK DOWN WHICH HAS 
BEEN A MAJOR CHALLENGE WE'VE USED 
THE LOCAL PCOS NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH 
SCHEME AND WARDENS 
THE MAIN THING 
WE CAN SEE THERE YES HE IS 
HOMELESS AT THE MOMENT BUT HE'S 
VERY MUCH LOVED BY HIS FAMILY AND 
WE HOPE HE CAN GET BACK IN CONTACT 
AND LET KNOW HE'S SAFE AND WELL 
YES IT'S VERY SAD THAT HIS FATHER 
PASSED AWAY LET'S HOPE HE DOES GET 
BACK IN TOUCH 
DO YOU REMEMBER STEPHEN COOPER HE 
STAYED UP TO WATCH 
SHE WOKE UP TO FIND BOTH HE AND HIS 
CAR HAD GONE 
THERE HAVE BEEN CALLS FROM ALL OVER 
THE COUNTRY SINCE WE FIRST MADE THE 
APPEAL TWO WEEKS AGO HERE IS A 
REMINDER OF WHAT HAPPENED 
FORTY SEVEN YEAR OLD STEVE COOPER LIVES NEAR 
HUDDERSFIELD IN YORKSHIRE WITH HIS 
PARTNER CLARE AND HER CHILDREN 
STEVE RELIES ON CLARE AS HE HAS A 
PAINFUL MEDICAL CONDITION AND HE'S 
NOT ABLE TO WORK 
ON JANUARY TWENTIETH THIS YEAR THE 
COUPLE SPEND A QUIET EVENING IN 
TOGETHER TOGETHER BUT IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE 
MORNING WHILE CLARE WAS ASLEEP 
STEVE DRIVES AWAY FROM HOME AND 
DOESN'T COME BACK 
THE NEXT MORNING HIS FAMILY REPORT 
HIM MISSING 
THE POLICE LAUNCH A NATIONWIDE 
SEARCH FOR HIM AND HIS CAR 
STEVE HAS BEEN GONE FOR THREE DAYS 
WHEN THERE'S A CALL FROM SCOTLAND 
WE FIRST CAME ACROSS THE VEHICLE 
WHEN IT WAS REPORTED ABANDONED TO 
US AROUND THE TWENTY THIRD JANUARY 
IT WAS MEMBERS OF THE SCOTTISH 
NATURAL HERITAGE THAT WORK IN THIS 
AREA THAT FIRST REPORTED THE CAR TO 
US US HIS FORD FOCUS IS FOUND IN THE 
SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS IT'S THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES 
FROM HIS HOME IN YORKSHIRE 
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF STEVE 
THE THE CAR WAS BASICALLY JUST THE BEYOND WHERE THE POLICE CAR WAS 
THIS WAS THE IMMEDIATE AREA AROUND 
HERE WHICH WE CONDUCTED THE SEARCH 
INITIALLY WITH POLICE DOGS IT'S 
VERY VERY THICK INITIALLY WE KEPT 
TO QUITE A SMALL RADIUS AROUND THE 
VEHICLE LOOKING FOR ANY SIGNS OF 
STEPHEN STEPHEN DOZENS OF VOLUNTEERS FROM THE CAIRN 
GORM MOUNTAIN RESCUE TEAM EXTEND 
THE SEARCH BEYOND THE FOREST 
WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION 
TO GO ON BECAUSE IN THIS INSTANCE 
THE POLICE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY 
IDEA IF THE GUY WAS ACTUALLY GOING 
FOR A WALK INTO THE MOUNTAINS OR 
INDEED JUST OUT FOR A DRIVE AND HAD 
BROKEN DOWN THERE WAS VERY LITTLE 
INFORMATION THAT WE COULD USE TO 
START THE SEARCH 
R. A. F. HELICOPTERS ARE CALLED OUT FOR 
TWO DAYS SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS 
COVER HUNDREDS OF MILES ON FOOT 
WE CLEARED THE MOUNTAINSIDE ABOVE 
THE FOREST AND THEN WE CHECKED THE 
BASE OF ALL THE CAGS BUT THERE WAS 
NO SIGN 
STEVE'S MEDICAL CONDITION MEANS HE 
CAN'T WALK FAR SO ON DAY THREE 
THE EMERGENCY SERVICES START TO 
SEARCH THE NEARBY LOCH 
WE TOOK OUT SOME KAYAKS AND 
CHECKED THE SHORE LINE OF THE WATER 
TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY SIGN OF HIM 
IN THE WATER THERE WAS NOTHING AT 
ALL ALL ON DAY FOUR OF THE INVESTIGATION 
R. A. F. HELICOPTERS BRING IN 
SOPHISTICATED SONAR EQUIPMENT TO 
SEARCH THE BOTTOM OF THE LOCH 
SENSORS THAT CAN DETECT SUBMERGED 
BODY ARE LOWERED INTO THE WATER 
BUT AFTER TWELVE HOURS OF PAIN STAKING 
WORK NOTHING HAS BEEN FOUND 
IT'S NOW WEEK SINCE STEVE 
DISAPPEARED FROM HOME EVERYONE 
SEARCHING FOR HIM IS MYSTIFIED 
I'VE BEEN DOING MOUNTAIN RESCUE FOR 
THIRTEEN YEARS IN ALL THAT TIMIOR NOT 
FINDING SOMEONE BUT AFTER THREE 
I DON'T REMEMBER NOT FINDING 
SOMEONE BUT AFTER THREE DAYS WE 
EXHAUSTED THAT AREA AND WE COULDN'T 
COME UP WITH ANY IDEAS OF WHERE HE 
MIGHT BE IT WAS LIKE THE GUY HAD 
COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED NO NO WITNESSES CAME FORWARD SEEING STEVE 
WITH HIS CAR IN SCOTLAND HE WAS 
LAST SEEN BY HIS FAMILY THREE 
MONTHS AGO WHEN HE SPENT A NORMAL 
EVENING AT HEEM NO ONE CAN 
UNDERSTAND WHY HE HAS EVENING AT 
HOME NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE 
DISAPPEARED 
THERE WERE NO HINTS OF DISAPPEARED ANY PROBLEM DEPRESSION NO 
PROBLEMS WITH HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH 
CLARE HE HAD SEEMED REALLY HAPPY 
IT'S ALL OUT OF CHARACTER HE USED

ANYTHING BOTHERING HIM HE USED TO

AROUND ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE P. M. ON THE SECOND WHEN WE 
HAVE HIM CAPTURED ON C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE 
IN THE YORKIES FISH BAR 
IT WAS A CONFIRMED SIGHTING OF 
DAMIEN WE USED AN EXPERT IN LIP 
READING TRYING TO ASSESS WHAT WAS 
SAID IN THE CHIP SHOP TO SEE IF ANY 
LINES OF INQUIRY AROSE FROM THAT 
FOR US 
A COPY OF THE FOOTAGE IS SENT TO 
LIP READING EXPERT FOR ANALYSIS 
THE POLICE HOPE IT WILL SHED LIGHT 
ON WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WHILE WHITE 
WAITING FOR THE RESULTS OFFICERS 
TRIED TO TRACE OTHER CUSTOMERS IN 
THE SHOP THAT NIGHT 
SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CHIP SHOP 
WERE IDENTIFIED AND INQUIRIES CAN 
CONTINUING NOW AND I AM STILL 
ANXIOUS TO IDENTIFY ALL OF THE 
PEOPLE IN THE CHIP SHOP ON THAT 
EVENING HE LEFT THERE WITHIN ABOUT 
FIVE MINUTES OR SO THE SUGGESTION 
FROM A WITNESS IS HE WENT TOWARDS 
THE GURNARD DIRECTION THERE IS 
QUITE A COMMON ROUTE USED BY PEOPLE 
WHO LIVE IN THE AREA ALONG THE SEA 
FRONT TOWARDS GURNARD 
IT'S LESS THAN TWO MILES FROM THIS 
PART OF COWES AND DAMIEN'S HOUSE 
THERE WERE TWO ROUTES HOME ALONG 
THE SEA FRONT OR THROUGH THE TOWN 
BUT WHICH ONE HAD HE TAKEN 
A LOT 
OF PEOPLE ASSUME HE WALKED ALONG 
THE SEA WALL AND FELL IN DAMIEN 
HAD A GOOD HEALTHY RESPECT FOR THE 
SEA HE WAS A FISHERMAN IT WAS A 
WINDY WET RAINY HORRIBLE COLD 
NIGHT I DON'T THINK FOR A MINUTE 
THAT DAMIEN WOULD HAVE WALKED ALONG 
THE SEA ROUTE 
A NUMBER OF INTENSIVE SEARCHES WERE 
CONDUCT AFTER DAMIEN'S 
DISAPPEARANCE SOME OF THOSE 
RELATED TO THE COASTLINE AREA 
AROUND COWES AND THE GURNARD AREA 
WHERE DAMIEN LIVED IN ADDITION TO 
THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF OTHER 
TARGETED LOCATIONS SEARCHED BOTH 
USING FINGERPRINT SEARCHES AND DOG 
UNITS 
NOTHING RELATING TO DAMIEN UNITS HAS BEEN FOUND IT'S NOW TWELVE YEARS 
SINCE HE WENT MISSING AND THE 
INVESTIGATION CONTINUES THE C. C. T. V. 
RECORDED ON THE NIGHT HE DITION 
APPEARED IS STILL THE STRONGEST 
DISAPPEARED IS STILL THE STRONGEST 
PIECE OF EVIDENCE IN THE 
INVESTIGATION FOR DAMIEN'S FAMILY 
THE PASSING OF TIME HAS DONE LITTLE 
TO EASE THE PAIN IF YOU HAVE ANY 
INFORMATION ABOUT DAMIEN'S 
DISAPPEARANCE THEN PLEASE CALL

POSTERS MAKE CONTACT AND YOU CAN 
OBVIOUSLY CONTACT THE MISSING 
PERSONS OR CONTACT THE LOCAL POLICE 
THAP IS AN INTERESTING POINT 
BEFORE I STARTED THIS I WAS 
POLICE OFFICER MYSELF IF WE WERE 
DEALING WITH THE A CASE SOMEONE 
MIGHT PHONE IN FROM MERSEYSIDE YOU 
CAN ALL TALK TO EACH OTHER IF 
SOMEONE IS REPORTED MISSING IT'S 
NATIONWIDE 
WE TALK TO EACH OTHER NATIONWIDE WE HAVE A NATIONAL BUREAU WHICH 
PULLS TOGETHER SIGHTINGS FROM ALL 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY YOU NEVER KNOW 
WHERE A SIGHTING IN A PART OF THE 
COUNTRY WILL LINK UP HOWEVER 
UNLIKE IT SEEMS WHEN YOU SEE 
SOMEONE WHO THINK YOU MAY HAVE SEEN 
ON A POSTER LET US KNOW THAT MIGHT 
BE THE SIGHTING THAT WILL BRING A 
BREAKTHROUGH BREAKTHROUGH IT DOES SEEM LIKE LONDON IS 
MAGNET FOR SOME OF THE MISSING 
PEOPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND 
THEMSELVES DRUN TO THE CAPITAL 
DRAWN TO THE CAPITAL THAT HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE THE STORIES 
OF PEOPLE HANGING AROUND TUBE 
STATIONS AND OXFORD STREET THOSE 
AREAS OF CENTRAL LONDON THERE IS 
AN INEVITABILITY TO THAT THE MET 
PUTS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF 
RESOURCE INTO WORKING WITH MISSING

UNDERFUNDED AREA WHAT DO WITH DOE 
TO HELP THERE PEOPLE COULD MAKE 
LORD ADONISATION

ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL TALK TO ALONE 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL TALK TO 
PAUL'S PEOPLE BUT NOT TO US IT'S 
ABOUT BEING THE RELATIONSHIP US 
WORKING TOGETHER EFFECTIVELY THAT 
NEEDS TO BE THE STORY 
IF I COULD ADD TO THAT WHAT IS 
ALSO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT 
MISSING IS A MASSIVE SOCIAL ISSUE 
WHICH IS ALMOST INVISIBLE SOMETIMES 
BECAUSE IT'S SO WIDESPREAD WE ARE 
WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH 
GOVERNMENT NOW WE REALLY HOPE THAT 
THIS PROGRAMME IS GOING TO MAKE
