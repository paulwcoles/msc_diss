MY HAND JUST SLIPPED OFF DO YOU THINK I WAS BORN YESTERDAY 
IT WAS JUST LIKE WACKY RACES THERE WAS BIKES ALL OVER THE PLACE 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING I HAD IN MIND AND THAT WAS TO RIDE FAST 
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE SAYS IT ALL 
NOW THE POLICE IN EAST YORKSHIRE HAVE UNLEASHED THEIR OWN MEAN MACHINE 
A COP ON A MOTORBIKE ON A MISSION 
IF THEY WANT TO COME HERE AND RIDE OUTSIDE OF THE LAW THEN WE MAKE NO BONES ABOUT IT 
WE'RE HERE WE HAVE THE STRATEGY AND THE TACTICS TO CATCH DANGEROUS ANTI SOCIAL MOTORCYCLISTS 
THE EAST RIDING OF YORKSHIRE 
NEARLY ONE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF SOME OF BRITAIN'S MOST IDYLLIC COUNTRYSIDE 
IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST POLICE DIVISIONS IN THE COUNTRY WITH ONE OF THE LEAST AMOUNTS OF CRIME 
BUT THE TRAFFIC COPS HERE ARE BUSIER THAN EVER 
THE MANY LONG WINDING AND EXHILARATING ROADS MEAN ONE THING 
IT'S A PLAYGROUND FOR BIKERS 
ENJOYMENT ON A BIKE ISN'T ABOUT RIDING IN A STRAIGHT LINE FAST 
LAST YEAR FIVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN BIKE CRASHES HERE AND ANOTHER FIFTY WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED 
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING ARE MALES AGED BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND FIFTY 
ON SPORTS BIKES OR SPORTS TOURERS WITH ENGINES SIZED ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED C. C. 
AND A STEREOTYPICAL CRASH WILL BE EXCESS SPEED FOR A GIVEN SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES 
WHERE EXCESS SPEED ON A BEND AND LOSING CONTROL ON A BEND 
P. C. DENNIS IS A BIKER HIMSELF AS WELL AS BEING A TRAFFIC COP 
HE'S TRYING TO CUT THE SPEEDS AND REDUCE THE DEATH TOLL 
BY TARGETING THE SMALL MINORITY WHO WANT TO RIDE BEYOND THE LIMIT 
GOT A HARDCORE NUCLEUS OF STUPID DANGEROUS INCONSIDERATE RIDERS 
WHO ARE INTENT ON RIDING THEIR MOTORCYCLES AS FAST AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN 
P. C. DENNIS'S HONDA V. F. R. CAN DO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE M. P. H. 
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S EQUIPPED WITH SOME OF THE LATEST CRIME FIGHTING GEAR 
DESIGNED TO CATCH THE BAD BIKERS 
ON CAMERA 
WE'VE GOT THE CAMERA MOUNTED THERE WHICH CAPTURES ALL THE EVIDENCE 
AND IN HERE WE'VE GOT THE RECORDER 
THIS IS WHAT I SHOW AT THE ROADSIDE I CAN REPLAY THIS AND SHOW THE OFFENDERS WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS 
THE EVIDENCE CAN BE GATHERED WITHOUT THE OFFENDING BIKERS 
HAVING ANY IDEA THEY'VE BEEN CAUGHT ON P. C. DENNIS'S CAMERA 
IT'S CLOCKED THE ONES IN THE DISTANCE AT NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR 
MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT OVER THE SPEED LIMIT 
IF CARS WERE CONSTANTLY DRIVING AROUND AT EIGHTY TO EIGHTY FIVE 
THEN EVERYONE WOULD BE UP IN ARMS 
BUT THERE'S THIS PERCEPTION I'M ON A BIKE WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT 
OF COURSE I'M GONNA BE EXCEEDING THE SPEED LIMIT 
I ADMIT MATE WE HAD A BLAST THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT ISN'T IT 
WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES NO 
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE 
THE LADS ARE TYPICAL OF THE ONES P. C. DENNIS CATCHES 
EXCEPT THEY'VE BEEN RIDING EACH OTHER'S BIKES 
AND THE DIFFERENCE IS MORE LOW DOWN TORQUE IN'T YOU RIGHT 
YOU'VE GOT TO USE ALL THE GEARING FOR THAT ONE AND THAT ONE'S JUST 
A PICTURE SAYS ONE THOUSAND WORDS DOESN'T IT 
AS WELL AS CREEPING UP BEHIND UNSUSPECTING RIDERS 
THE TRAFFIC COPS ALSO GO FOR THEM IN PACKS 
P. C.'S IAN JOHN AND SARAH WHITE 
ARE PARKED UP WITH A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE B. TWELVE FORTY EIGHT 
WHILE P. C. DENNIS ON HIS HONDA 
IS TWO MILES DOWN THE ROAD WAITING FOR THEIR TIP OFF 
THE SPEED LIMIT THROUGH THE VILLAGE OF WETWANG IS THIRTY M. P. H. 
HE WASN'T HANGING ABOUT WAS HE 
CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THIS BIKE RIDER'S OBSERVING 
YEAH RED AND WHITE ONE COMING TOWARDS YOU FROM TIBTHORPE 
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS TO CATCH IT UP NOW 
KEEP AN EYE OUT 
HE'S GOING LIKE A BAT OUT OF HELL 
BUT WITH P. C. DENNIS LYING IN WAIT 
HE MIGHT SOON BE A DEAD DUCK 
THE INFORMATION I HAD OVER THE RADIO WAS THIS BIKE WAS TRAVELLING AT VERY HIGH SPEED 
AND WAS JUST LEAVING IAN AND SARAH WAY BEHIND 
HE'S OUT OF OUR VIEW NOW 
WE'RE NINETY TO A TON AND HE'S LONG GONE 
HE WAS SO FAST ALL THEY COULD PUT OUT WAS A DESCRIPTION OF A RED V. TWIN 
JUST A RED AND WHITE BIKE 
DUCATI TYPE ISH YEAH VERY LOW 
IT'S DUCATI TYPE I'M RELIABLY INFORMED 
IAN KNEW IT WAS A V. TWIN BY THE ENGINE NOISE BECAUSE HE'S A MOTORCYCLIST HIMSELF 
BUT IT WAS SO FAST THAT IT WAS CLEAR TO IAN AND CLEAR TO SARAH 
THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING ON HIS MIND AND THAT'S RIDING AS FAST AS HE CAN 
YEAH WHITE HELMET I THINK AND A BLACK JACKET 
HE'S OUT OF SIGHT HE'S THROUGH THE DIP AND TOWARDS GARTON I WOULD THINK NOW 
AND SURE ENOUGH A RED V. TWIN MOTORCYCLE COMES UP TO THE JUNCTION 
BUT BEFORE I CAN ACTUALLY GET ANYWHERE NEAR HIM HE'S JUST ABSOLUTELY DISAPPEARED 
HE HAS NAILED THAT THROTTLE 
HE WAS UP IN THE DISTANCE HALF A MILE OR SO AHEAD OF ME 
BLACK TOP WITH WHITE ON IT 
SOME VEHICLES ON THE ROAD AHEAD HAVE COME TO P. C. DENNIS'S AID 
THEY'VE HELPED HIM CATCH UP WITH THE SPEEDING BIKER 
NOW HIS CAMERA EQUIPMENT IS CATCHING THE EVIDENCE 
HE'D BEEN SLOWED DOWN BY TRAFFIC A TRACTOR AND SO ON 
SO I JUST FOLLOWED HIM 
WE OVERTOOK TWO OR THREE CARS 
I THINK THERE WAS A GOODS VEHICLE IN THERE 
AND THEN I NOTED HIS SPEED GETTING UP TO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED 
ONE HUNDRED TEN M. P. H. ON MY SPEEDO 
P. C. DENNIS HAS GOT ALL THE EVIDENCE HE NEEDS 
BUT SOMEHOW HE MUST NOW STOP THE RIDER 
EVERY TIME WE FOLLOW A BIKE THE FIRST THING ON MY MIND IS SAFETY 
HOWEVER IT WAS GETTING TOWARDS THE TOLERANCES 
OF WHERE I'M NOT PREPARED TO CONTINUE 
LUCKILY THERE'S A ROUNDABOUT COMING UP WHERE AS PART OF THE PLAN 
MORE OF HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN POSITIONED 
THE RIDER MADE A BIG MISTAKE NOT SPOTTING A COP ON HIS TAIL 
BUT AT LEAST HE'S SEEN THE ONES AHEAD 
WHEN HE SAW THE UNMARKED CAR AT THE ROUNDABOUT HIS HEAD DROPPED 
AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS IF TO SAY OH NO WHAT TROUBLE AM I IN 
I THEN PULLED ALONGSIDE HIM 
HE TOOK ONE LOOK AT ME AND HIS HEAD DROPPED EVEN FURTHER 
AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE KNEW THE GRAVITY OF THE PROBLEM HE WAS FACING 
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE SAYS IT ALL 
BUT THE VIDEO WILL SHOW HIM EVEN MORE 
HERE'S THE VIDEO THE CAMERA'S IN THERE 
NOW WATCH MY SPEEDS COMPARED TO YOURS 
I'M STAYING WITH YOU SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX EIGHTY 
BIG OVERTAKE ON THE CARAVAN 
THE STANDARD OF RIDING ISN'T THAT GOOD I HAVE TO SAY 
ONE HUNDRED THREE ONE HUNDRED SEVEN ONE HUNDRED NINE ONE HUNDRED TEN 
THAT'S THE EVIDENCE THIS WILL BE PUT BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE 
HE JUST RESIGNED HIMSELF TO THE FACT THAT HE'D DONE WRONG 
ACCEPTED WHAT I WAS SAYING 
DIDN'T ARGUE WITH IT AND PUT HIS HANDS UP REALLY TO IT 
THE MAN'S HONDA S. P. ONE 
IS A MODEL THAT WAS RACED TO VICTORY AT THE T. T. ON THE ISLE OF MAN 
IT'S BEEN BUILT FOR SPEED 
AND MIDDLE AGED ENTHUSIASTS 
A THIRTY SOMETHING MALE RACE ROAD BIKE 
ALBEIT A NINETEEN NINETIES RACE ROAD BIKE AN S. P. ONE BUT 
FALLS INTO THE STEREOTYPICAL PROBLEM MOTORCYCLIST THAT WE HAVE 
I THINK HE'S LOOKING AT CERTAINLY A LOT OF POINTS AND A HEAVY FINE POSSIBLY LOSING HIS LICENCE 
AND THAT'S NOT ALL 
DID YOU PUT THAT NUMBER PLATE ON THE BACK THEN NO 
WAS IT ON IT WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT YES 
SARAH NOTED A VERY SMALL NUMBER PLATE 
MOST WILL ARGUE THAT IT'S FOR AESTHETICS TO MAKE IT LOOK PRETTY 
THE SIZE OF YOUR LETTERS IS SMALLER 
A SMALL NUMBER PLATE IS INSIGNIFICANT TO THE SPEED HE'D BEEN RIDING AT 
SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BIT OVER THE TOP TO PROSECUTE HIM FOR IT 
SHE USED HER DISCRETION AND POINTED OUT TO HIM IT IS AN OFFENCE 
AND UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MAY BE PROSECUTED 
IT'S ONLY A WARNING FOR THE NUMBER PLATE 
HOWEVER THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HIS LICENCE HAS HIT THE RIDER HARD 
HE'S ONLY JUST HOLDING HIMSELF TOGETHER 
YOU CAN SEE HIS LIP QUIVERING HE'S IN A REAL STATE 
WE'VE TOLD HIM TO COMPOSE HIMSELF AND PULL THE BIKE OVER 
I FEEL QUITE SORRY FOR THE GUY 
HOWEVER HE'S IN CONTROL OF THE BIKE 
IF HIS LICENCE WAS SO PRECIOUS TO HIM 
HE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT MORE ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING 
IT WAS STUPID VERY STUPID 
SLOW YOURSELF DOWN MATE ALL RIGHT 
HE'D BEEN DELIBERATELY RIDING AT A VERY HIGH SPEED FOR A SUSTAINED AMOUNT OF TIME 
AND HE'S ONLY GOT HIMSELF TO BLAME 
IT'S A TYPICAL SUMMER'S DAY IN THE COUNTRY 
JUST THE KIND THAT ATTRACTS BIKERS OUT FOR A RIDE 
INEVITABLY THOUGH ONE HAS COME OFF 
JUST CONFIRM IT'S THE JUNCTION OF THE B. FOURTEEN HUNDRED 
THE TRAFFIC COPS HAVE GOT A FORTY MILE DRIVE TO GET TO THE ACCIDENT SCENE 
ON A COUNTRY LANE IN NORTH LINCOLNSHIRE 
IT'S USUALLY JUST EXCESS SPEED 
OVERTAKING IN INAPPROPRIATE PLACES THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD 
BUT THIS IS NO ORDINARY MOTORBIKE ACCIDENT 
IT APPEARS THERE'S BEEN A HEAD ON COLLISION OF A MOTORCYCLE AND A HORSE 
THERE'S A HORSE INVOLVED 
CALL AN AMBULANCE AND POSSIBLY A VET 
ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES A HORSE IS USUALLY SERIOUS' 
AND IF THEY ARE INJURED THEY CAN BE VERY UNPREDICTABLE 
AND OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GOT AN ISSUE THERE WITH THE RIDER 
THE RIDER COULD BE UNSEATED THE HORSE COULD BE CHARGING UP THE MAIN ROAD 
I'LL JUST CHECK AND SEE HOW THE RIDER IS 
WE'LL GET ANY VEHICLES OUT OF THE WAY 
THE ACCIDENT HAS HAPPENED ROUND A SHARP BLIND BEND 
THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WAS THAT THERE WAS A SKID MARK ON THE ROAD 
A SINGLE SKID MARK SO OBVIOUSLY I KNOW THERE'S A FAIRLY GOOD CHANCE THAT'S FROM THE ACTUAL MOTORCYCLE 
THE SKID MARK IS A GOOD TWO FEET ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD FROM WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
SO STRAIGHT AWAY I'M THINKING THE MOTORBIKE'S ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD 
THERE'S NO SIGN OF THE HORSE 
BUT THE MOTORCYCLIST IS STILL HERE WAITING TO BE TAKEN TO HOSPITAL HOW ARE YOU DOING 
WELL I'VE DONE BETTER 
GOOD GOOD OFF TO SCUNTHORPE YEAH 
I'LL COME AND SEE YOU THERE 
YOUR MOTORBIKE YEAH 
HAVE YOU GOT IT FULLY COMP 
DO YOU KNOW 
I'M SURE IT WILL BE YEAH 
DO YOU WANT ME TO START THE RECOVERY FOR YOU I'M ONLY DOWN THE ROAD 
O. K. I'LL COME AND SEE YOU IN HOSPITAL ALL RIGHT MATE THANKS 
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE HORSE DO YOU KNOW 
THE BIKE RIDER'S INJURIES ARE NOT TOO SERIOUS BUT HE CAME OFF WORSE THAN THE HORSE AND RIDER 
IS YOUR HORSE O. K. YEAH THEY'VE HOSED HIM DOWN 
HE'S JUST GOT A COUPLE OF CUTS BUT 
THERE WAS ACTUALLY TWO HORSES INVOLVED AND TWO RIDERS' 
ONE OF THE HORSES HAD BOLTED BUT THEY GOT HOLD OF IT AND THE HORSES HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY TO A LOCAL FARM 
A LUCKY ESCAPE FOR THE HORSE AFTER BEING STRUCK BY THIS BRUTE 
IT'S A HONDA SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY AFRICA TWIN 
IT'S A REAL BIG POWERFUL OFF ROAD HEAVY MACHINE 
HE SKIDDED THAT MUCH ON THE TYRE 
THE TYRE'S ACTUALLY BLISTERED AND ALMOST A FLAT SPOT ON THE TYRE 
SO HE'S BEEN BRAKING REALLY HARD 
THE MARKINGS ON THE ROAD TELL THE TALE OF WHAT HAPPENED 
A THIRTY F. T. SKID MARK 
HERE FOLLOW THAT ALONG TO HERE 
JUST AS THE SKIDDING BIKE LAID DOWN CRUCIAL EVIDENCE ON THE ROAD SURFACE SO DID THE HORSE 
THESE ARE THE HOOF PRINTS OF THE HORSE 
THIS WOULD BE THE POINT OF IMPACT SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF A QUESTION 
WHY IS THE MOTORCYCLIST ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD GOING ROUND THE BEND 
THAT'S A QUESTION THE BIKE RIDER WON'T BE ABLE TO ANSWER UNTIL AFTER HE HAS BEEN TREATED IN HOSPITAL 
IN THE MEANTIME P. C. DOWALL A BIKER AS WELL HAS HIS OWN THEORY 
HE'D BEEN EXTENDING HIS VIEW AROUND THE CORNER 
HE'D BEEN APPROACHING A BLIND NEARSIDE BEND 
WHICH MEANS YOUR VIEW IS SEVERELY RESTRICTED 
THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE THAT VIEW BETTER 
IS TO GO OVER THE WHITE LINE 
AND THAT MEANS TROUBLE PUNCTURE IN HIS BACK TYRE AS WELL 
SOON AS YOU DO THAT YOU'RE DRIVING WITHOUT DUE CARE AND ATTENTION 
BECAUSE YOU'RE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
HAPPY WITH THEIR CONCLUSION THE SCENE CAN BE TIDIED UP AND THE BIKE PUT SOMEWHERE SAFE 
I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GO TO HOSPITAL HAVE HIS INJURIES TREATED 
THEN GET BACK AND FIND HIS MOTORBIKE WAS MISSING AND REPORT A STOLEN MOTORBIKE 
BEAUTIFUL IT'S A BIG FELLA 
IT WEIGHED ABOUT SIX HUNDRED K. G. IT WAS MASSIVE 
IT'S A BIG BEAST ISN'T IT 
EH OH GOT IT ALL RIGHT 
NEEDED TWO OF US 
COULD HAVE DONE WITH THREE ACTUALLY 
IN EAST YORKSHIRE ROAD SAFETY IS THE TRAFFIC COPS' NUMBER ONE PRIORITY 
P. C. STEVE YOUNGSON IS A PEOPLE PERSON 
DOING HIS BIT FOR THE CAUSE IN THE PRETTY SEASIDE TOWN OF BRIDLINGTON 
IT WASN'T THE DRIVING ABOUT IN THE FAST CARS 
THAT DREW ME INTO TRAFFIC IT WAS DEALING WITH PEOPLE REALLY 
QUITE OFTEN WHEN YOU STOP A MOTORIST TO SPEAK TO THEM 
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE HAD ANY DEALINGS WITH THE POLICE 
I ENJOY THAT SIDE OF IT AND TRYING TO EDUCATE THE MOTORISTS 
INTO BEING MORE CAREFUL ON THE ROAD 
AND THAT MEANS WARNING PEOPLE WHO'RE DRIVING ABOUT WITH DEFECTS ON THEIR CARS 
MY ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO A NICE SHINY BLACK RANGE ROVER 
YOU JUST LOOK YOU THINK THAT'S A NICE VEHICLE 
GOT TINTED WINDOWS ON IT 
IT MAY BE A NICE VEHICLE BUT P. C. YOUNGSON ISN'T TOO KEEN ON ITS WINDOWS 
DIDN'T LIKE THE FACT THAT THE WINDOWS LOOKED RATHER DARK 
SO I TURNED ROUND FOLLOWED THE VEHICLE 
DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER IT'S A TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED SPECIAL FROM THE AUCTION 
OR WHETHER IT'S A SIXTY THOUSAND TOP OF THE RANGE RANGE ROVER 
IF THERE'S AN OFFENCE THERE ON A VEHICLE IT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH 
I WILL DEAL WITH IT IN A WAY THAT I SEE FAIR 
I HADN'T SEEN WHO WAS DRIVING IT WHEN THE VEHICLE CAME PAST ME 
ANOTHER REASON WHY I'M NOT A BIG FAN ON TINTED WINDOWS 
PUT THE WINDOW DOWN 
YOUR WINDOWS AT THE FRONT YEAH THESE ONES WHO TINTED THEM FOR YOU 
WE JUST BOUGHT THEM WITH THE CAR LIKE THIS 
RIGHT WHERE DID YOU BUY THE CAR FROM LANDROVER 
O. K. ARE YOU AWARE THAT THOSE WINDOWS WILL BE ILLEGAL 
WHEN WHEN NOW NO WHY WOULD THEY SELL US THE CAR IF IT'S ILLEGAL 
YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE THAT UP WITH THEM 
THE LADY SAID THAT THEY HAD BOUGHT THE CAR FROM THE DEALERSHIP WITH THE TINTS FITTED 
BUT THE DRIVER HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS VEHICLE IS IN A ROADWORTHY CONDITION 
ANYTHING FROM THE FRONT FORWARDS 
IF IT DOESN'T LET THROUGH SEVENTY PER CENT OF NATURAL DAYLIGHT 
THEY'RE ILLEGAL WHICH WILL BE POINTS ON YOUR DRIVING LICENCE AND A SIXTY FINE 
WELL THAT'S BAD SEEING AS THEY HAVE JUST SOLD ME THE CAR 
YEAH BUT THAT IS SOMETHING YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP WITH THEM 
IT BOILS DOWN TO THE OWNER OR THE DRIVER OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE 
IF YOU'VE GOT YOUR NATURAL DAYLIGHT CUT BY A LARGE PERCENTAGE 
YOU ARE HIGHLY LIKELY NOT TO SEE THE MOTORCYCLIST 
THE PERSON ON A BIKE MAYBE NOT EVEN SEE THE BLACK CAR AND PULL OUT IN FRONT OF IT 
ER WELL I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY 
SHE WAS ALSO WEARING SUNGLASSES WHICH MADE IT DOUBLY DARK LOOKING THROUGH THOSE SIDE WINDOWS' 
ARE THEY ACTUALLY TINTED WINDOWS OR IS IT STUCK ON 
YEAH IT'S A FILM THAT'S STUCK ONTO THE GLASS 
THE LARGE MAJORITY OF TINTED WINDOWS ARE A FILM THAT HAS BEEN STUCK ON 
THE LADY'S GOING TO GET A CHOICE REMOVE THE FILM OR GET A TICKET 
I CAN GIVE YOU TWO OPTIONS YEAH 
THE FIRST ONE BEING THAT YOU CAN PEEL THE TINTS OFF HERE AND NOW 
I'D TRY BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT 
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM I CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU FOR OBVIOUS REASONS 
BECAUSE YOU COULD THEN SAY I HAVE DAMAGED YOUR CAR 
OH BLOODY ELL I'M NOT BEING RUDE ARE THOSE YOUR PROPER NAILS OR ARE THEY STUCK ON NO 
I HAVE THEM DONE I DON'T WANNA BREAK THEM TO BE HONEST 
RIGHT JUST BEAR WITH ME TWO TICKS 
YOUNGSON HAS GOT A GADGET FOR MEASURING THE PERCENTAGE OF LIGHT 
TRANSMITTED THROUGH A WINDOW HE CALLS IT HIS TINTMAN 
ANYTHING BELOW THIRTY PER CENT OF NATURAL DAYLIGHT 
AND YOU CAN GET THREE POINTS ON YOUR DRIVING LICENCE 
AS WELL AS A SIXTY FIXED PENALTY 
OR YOU CAN FACE AN IMMEDIATE PROHIBITION AND THE VEHICLE DOESN'T MOVE 
IT WORKS BY SHINING A CALIBRATED LIGHT SOURCE THROUGH THE GLASS 
IF THE WINDOWS FAIL THE TEST THE LADY'S IN TROUBLE 
I THINK SHE'D JUST DROPPED HER HUSBAND OFF TO WATCH SOME FOOTBALL 
OBVIOUSLY SHE WAS UPSET AND SHOCKED AT BEING STOPPED SO SHE TELEPHONED HIM 
HIYA I'VE JUST BEEN PULLED OVER BY THE POLICE YEAH 
OUR FRONT WINDOWS THEY'RE ILLEGAL 
JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THAT THAT'S LETTING THROUGH ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT OF NATURAL DAYLIGHT 
YEAH AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO LET THROUGH SEVENTY PER CENT 
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO LET THROUGH SEVENTY PER CENT AND WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT 
SO GET YOUR ARSE UP HERE STEVE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
STEVE I CANNOT DRIVE THE CAR AWAY WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THIS 
IF I DRIVE IT AWAY LOOKING LIKE THIS WITH THE TINTED WINDOWS AND I GET A FINE 
I'M NOT STEVE 
UNSURPRISINGLY HER DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW IS NOT LEGAL EITHER 
IT'S THE SAME ON THAT SIDE 
CAN YOU SEE THAT ONE AGAIN YEAH 
O. K. RIGHT CAN I JUST TAKE SOME DETAILS FROM YOU 
AM I GONNA GET A FINE 
WELL HOPEFULLY YOUR HUSBAND WILL AGREE TO TAKE THEM OFF 
I WILL GIVE YOU THIS FORM THAT SAYS THEY HAVE BEEN TESTED 
IF HE SAYS YES HE WILL TAKE THEM OFF THEN I'M QUITE PREPARED TO END THE MATTER THERE 
IN NORTH LINCOLNSHIRE P. C. RICKY DOWALL IS CHECKING UP 
ON THE WELFARE OF THE HORSE AND RIDER HIT BY THE SKIDDING MOTORBIKE 
AND THAT MEANS FILLING OUT FORMS 
A TWENTY PAGE DOCUMENT THAT IS ALL THE INSURANCE DETAILS 
DRIVING LICENCE DETAILS EITHER THE RIDER 
OR DRIVER AND PASSENGERS IF THERE'S WITNESSES 
WHAT SORT OF HORSE HAVE YOU GOT 
WHAT MAKE IS IT WHAT RANDOM MODEL 
WHAT MODEL'S IT C. C. 
ER THOROUGHBRED WARMBLOOD 
IS IT ONE HORSEPOWER 
NOT SO SURE SOMETIMES 
WHAT IS IT A THOROUGHBRED WHAT THOROUGHBRED WARMBLOOD 
IS THAT ITS BREED THAT'S ITS BREED YEAH 
HOW MANY HANDS IS HE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO 
I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT EH SEE 
SIXTEEN POINT TWO 
BIG HORSE THEN YEAH 
HAS HE GOT ANY SORT OF CUTS 
HE'S GOT A FEW GRAZES ON HIM BUT I'VE CHECKED ALL HIS LEGS AND HE'S FINE SO A FEW GRAZES THEN 
JUST A FEW GRAZES THAT'S ALL TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED WE WERE SINGLE FILE 
WE WERE STOPPED NEAR THAT TELEGRAPH POLE JUST BEFORE THE BEND BECAUSE WE'D HEARD A BIKE 
KNOWING HOW FAST THEY COME ROUND THAT BEND 
WE JUST STOPPED THEM TO PREPARE THEM FOR IT THEN WHAT HAPPENED 
HE CAME ROUND THE BEND HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE WHITE LINE 
ON HIS SIDE OF THE ROAD BUT HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO IT 
IT LOOKED LIKE HE'D BRAKED BECAUSE HE SUDDENLY WOBBLED 
AND THEN WITH THAT HE WAS ON OUR SIDE OF THE ROAD 
MY HORSE OBVIOUSLY KNEW SOMETHING 
HE SPUN ROUND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES SO HE WAS FACING THE OTHER WAY 
THE BIKE JUST WENT ON ITS SIDE AND HE WAS SLIDING TOWARDS ME 
HE MADE CONTACT WITH MY HORSE AND MY HORSE WAS JUST TRYING TO CLAMBER OUT OF THE WAY 
AND THAT'S WHEN I CAME OFF AND LANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
MY HORSE RAN OFF UP THE ROAD 
THAT TIES IN STRAIGHT AWAY COS HE WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD 
I KNEW THAT ANYWAY FROM THE SKID MARKS 
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH BYE 
I THINK HE'S O. K. HE WAS VERY BADLY SHOOK UP 
HE'S GOT A FEW GRAZES ON HIS LEGS BUT I THINK HE'LL BE O. K. I'M JUST GONNA KEEP MY EYE ON HIM ALL DAY 
I MEAN HE'S NOT GONNA LIKE IT AS SOON AS I GET BACK ON HIM 
IF WE SEE A BIKE NOW ON THE ROAD HE'S JUST GONNA GO MAD 
SO I THINK I'VE GOT A FEW BATTLES TO GET THROUGH NOW 
P. C. DOWALL IS HAPPY THE MOTORBIKE RIDER WAS AT FAULT FOR THE ACCIDENT 
BUT HE'S VISITING HIM IN HOSPITAL TO SEE IF HE CAN GET IT FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH 
KNOWING HOW MANY HORSES ARE DOWN THAT ROAD 
AND HOW SANDY THAT SOMETIMES GETS 
WE'RE EVER SO CAREFUL DOWN THERE 
THAT'S WHAT ANNOYS ME YOU KNOW WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED 
I WAS JUST COMING TO THAT I WAS JUST GONNA ASK YOU THAT 
COS I CANNOT REMEMBER ONE THING CAN'T REMEMBER NO ALL RIGHT THEN 
THAT'S NOT ME PLAYING SILLY BUGGERS COS I CAN'T REMEMBER A THING 
I WOULDN'T SUGGEST IT WAS ER 
FOR SOME OBSCURE REASON HE JUST COULD NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE COLLISION AT ALL 
WHAT TIME DID YOU SET OFF AT THEN REMEMBER THAT NO NO NO 
THE ONLY THING HE COULD REMEMBER WAS HE'D LOST HIS WALLET 
HAS SOMEBODY FOUND MY WALLET 
THAT WAS IT THAT WAS THE ONLY THING HE COULD REMEMBER 
I'M CONCERNED COS IT'S GOT ER 
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WILL SOMETIMES DO THAT 
AT THE END OF THE DAY HAD HE BEEN RIDING IN THE CORRECT MANNER 
ON HIS RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD 
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE CONFRONTED THE HORSES LITERALLY HEAD ON 
KEEP GOING KEEP GOING 
AS IN ALL ROAD ACCIDENTS THE MAN IS BEING BREATH TESTED 
IT'S AT ZERO SO I'M HAPPY WITH THAT 
DRINK ISN'T THE CAUSE OF HIS MEMORY LOSS 
WHATEVER DID HAPPEN HE WILL HAVE SOME PAINFUL MEMORIES 
FROM A BROKEN ANKLE THEY'VE X. RAYED THE ANKLE 
HE'S TRAPPED HIS ANKLE UNDER THE MACHINE 
SO YOU'VE GOT A FIVE HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED KILO MOTORBIKE ON TOP OF HIS ANKLE IT'S JUST SNAPPED HIS ANKLE 
WHEN THE BIKE'S SKIDDED HE'D BROKEN THE GOLDEN RULE OF MOTORCYCLISTS 
IF YOU'RE INVOLVED IN A COLLISION NEVER EVER HOLD ONTO YOUR MOTORBIKE 
BECAUSE IT WILL JUST HURT YOU AND IT WILL HURT YOU VERY BADLY 
BACK IN BRIDLINGTON THE MAN WHO WAS HOPING TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON 
WATCHING THE FOOTBALL HAS COME OUT TO SAVE HIS WIFE GETTING A RED CARD 
JUST SPOKE TO RANGE ROVER AND IT SAYS THEY GET GET DAMAGED IF YOU TRY AND DO 'EM YOURSELF 
ALL I WOULD SAY TO YOU IS THAT THAT IS JUST A STUCK ON FILM 
SO PROVIDING YOU'RE PREPARED JUST TO TAKE A BIT OF THAT OFF SO THAT IT LOOKS 
I KNOW YOU WILL REMOVE THAT TAPE THEY DID TELL ME NOT TO TOUCH IT 
I'M SORRY BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THREE POINTS 
THEY CAN PAY FOR THE DAMAGED WINDOW 
THIS IS BY NO MEANS A NEW SITUATION FOR P. C. YOUNGSON 
I CAN'T SAY HOW MANY PEOPLE I'VE HAD TAKE THEM OFF BUT IT'S A LOT 
AND I'VE NOT SEEN ANYBODY DAMAGE A WINDOW AS YET 
JUST PEEL IT OFF STEVE FOR GOD'S SAKE 
THE TINT WAS STUCK ON THERE VERY WELL 
SO I WAS QUITE HAPPY FOR HIM JUST TO REMOVE A FEW PIECES 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE A DRIVING AROUND IN A VEHICLE LIKE THAT 
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR WINDOWS LOOKING A MESS 
I CAN'T DO IT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS BUT YOU JUST SEE ALONG THERE 
ALONG THAT EDGE IT'S A FILM 
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FEEL IT WHEN YOU GO DOWN O. K. 
YEAH IF WE CAN JUST BREAK A BIT OF THAT 
THERE YOU GO ALL IT IS IT'S JUST A STUCK ON FILM 
FAIR ENOUGH IF YOU CAN JUST TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE OFF NOT BEING FUNNY OR ANYTHING 
WHEN YOU'VE GOT A DECENT CHUNK MISSING OFF THE WINDOW 
YOU KNOW THAT THE REST OF IT'S GONNA BE TAKEN OFF 
THAT'LL DO FOR ME NOW BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA GO AND GET THAT TAKEN OFF 
WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALISE IF THEY JUST GET A HAIR DRYER 
AND ACTUALLY WARM THE FILM UP BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY TAKE IT ALL OFF 
IT MELTS THE GLUE AND THAT WAY IT WILL JUST PEEL STRAIGHT OFF 
YEAH THAT'S ALL RIGHT MATE THAT'LL DO YEAH O. K. 
HAD I GIVEN HER A SIXTY FINE THREE POINTS ON HER DRIVING LICENCE 
AND THEN SAID TO HER REMOVE THE TINTS 
I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY 
BUT BY GIVING HER AN ALTERNATIVE THEN THAT WAS MY DISCRETION TO DEAL WITH IT IN THAT MANNER 
AND THAT IS THE WAY THAT I USUALLY FIND WORKS BEST 
AND IT GETS THE TINTS OFF THE WINDOW AND CURES THE PROBLEM 
O. K. ALL RIGHT THEN ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SEE YOU LATER 
P. C. DOWALL WAS A SERGEANT IN THE ROYAL MARINES BEFORE JOINING THE POLICE 
NOTHING HE DID THERE COULD HAVE PREPARED HIM FOR THE DAY HE'S HAVING TODAY 
I WONDER IF YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK AT 
A REPORT OF A STRAY DOG ON THE A FIFTEEN PLEASE 
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT 
IF I'VE HAD A POUND FOR EVERY DOG I'VE DEALT WITH 
IT'S NEVER IT'S REALLY SOFT NEVER BIT ANYBODY IN ITS LIFE 
I WOULDN'T SAY THEY HAPPEN EVERY DAY BUT IT'S AT LEAST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK 
WE GET SOME SORT OF ANIMAL EITHER ON THE CARRIAGEWAY 
ON THE ROAD OR NEAR THE ROAD 
I JUST THOUGHT WE'LL SPEND HALF AN HOUR CHASING IT UP AND DOWN THE ROAD 
AND EVENTUALLY IT'LL GET RUN OVER BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN 
AND THEN WHEN WE ACTUALLY GET THERE 
I SEE THAT SOMEBODY'S ACTUALLY GOT THE DOG THERE ON A LEASH ALREADY 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT LOOK AT IT HE LOOKS LIKE A BIG PUPPY DOG 
THE BIG PUPPY DOG IS ACTUALLY A BIG ROTTWEILER 
IT'S WHAT WE WOULD CLASS AS WHAT WE WOULD CALL A LAND SHARK 
BECAUSE ROTTWEILERS AREN'T RENOWNED TO BE PLACID ARE THEY 
DOWALL HAS HAS EXPERIENCE WITH THESE DOGS A BAD EXPERIENCE 
A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS YOUNG IN THE SERVICE 
THERE WAS A ROTTWEILER JUST GOT A LITTLE NIBBLE AT THE TOP OF MY CHEEK 
IF YOU GET THE PICTURE 
SO I'M ALWAYS THINKING I JUST STAND BACK A LITTLE BIT 
HELLO HE'S JUST TERRIFIED HE'S FAIRLY CLEAN ISN'T HE 
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT AND HE'S HAD HIS TAIL DOCKED AND HIS NAILS ARE REALLY SHORT 
SO THEY'VE EITHER BEEN CLIPPED OR HE'S BEEN ON THE RUN FOR AGES 
IT WAS A NICE LOOKING DOG IT'D OBVIOUSLY BEEN WELL LOOKED AFTER 
I'D HAZARD A GUESS THAT IT'S PROBABLY ESCAPED RATHER THAN BEEN ABANDONED 
IF SOMEBODY SWERVES TO HIT HIM THERE'S GONNA BE A BANG ISN'T THERE YEAH 
THAT'S RIGHT HE'S BEEN ON TO THE A FIFTEEN AND WE'VE MANAGED TO GET HIM BACK 
ROTTWEILERS ARE BIG BIG POWERFUL DOGS' 
THAT DOG BEING LOOSE COULD HAVE CAUSED A MAJOR PILE UP SO IT WAS SERIOUS 
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT 
IT'S ON THE A FIFTEEN IT'S A REAL LONG VERY VERY BUSY ROAD 
THANKFULLY THE PASSERS BY WERE ABLE TO AVERT A CATASTROPHE 
BUT THERE WERE NO CLUES TO WHO LET THE DOG OUT 
GETTING IN MY CAR TO GO TO THE SHOP COS I JUST LIVE DOWN HERE 
AND I SAW THE DOG AND I THOUGHT IT WERE GOING TO GET KILLED IF IT GETS NEAR THE A FIFTEEN 
SO I MANAGED TO GET HIM TO JUST SIT ON THE ROAD NEXT TO ME 
AND HE WAS JUST SETTLED THERE 
AND THIS GENTLEMAN STOPPED WITH HIS CAR SO THAT MADE IT A BIT SAFER 
P. C. DOWALL'S NOT ONE TO LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE 
HE PLANS TO TAKE HIM IN THE BACK OF HIS CAR 
COME ON THEN COME ON UP BUT THERE'S A HOLD UP 
HEY COME ON COME ON IT'S WELL TRAINED 
HE'S NOT HAVING IT COME ON 
COME ON THEN GOOD BOY COME ON NOW COME ON 
HE'S RESISTING ARREST 
SECRETLY I WANT TO BE A DOG MAN CAN YOU TELL 
MAYBE COAX HIM WITH A DRINK 
THAT'S FREE POLICE WATER 
AREN'T YOU GOING TO GET IN AND HAVE A DRINK COME ON UP HERE 
I TRIED WATER AND SOME LITTLE CHEWY STICKS BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE DOG WASN'T HAVING ANY OF THAT 
TIME FOR PLAN B. PUT IN A REQUEST FOR REINFORCEMENTS 
YEAH HAVE WE GOT A DOG MAN ON DUTY AT ALL 
HE'S NOT VICIOUS BUT HE'S JUST REFUSING TO GET IN THE BACK 
DISCRETION BEING THE BETTER PART OF VALOUR WE ASKED FOR THE DOG MAN 
WHEN THEY TURN UP I'M SURE BETWEEN THE TWO OF US WE CAN GET IT IN THE BACK OF THE CAR 
DOGS MAY BE MAN'S BEST FRIENDS BUT LURKING COPPERS CERTAINLY AREN'T THE MOTORISTS' 
THIS IS A SPOT ON THE A SIX FOURTEEN WHERE P. C. YOUNGSON LIKES 
TO LIE IN WAIT FOR UNSUSPECTING DRIVERS WHO OVERTAKE ILLEGALLY 
THERE'S SOLID WHITE LINES AND IN THE CENTRE OF THEM 
IT'S PAINTED RED TO PROTECT THE JUNCTION 
I'VE BEEN TO SEVERAL ACCIDENTS AND SADLY A FATALITY AS WELL 
DESPITE ALL THE ROAD MARKINGS THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE WHO THINKS THEY DON'T APPLY TO THEM 
WHOA 
SEEMED TO COME FROM NOWHERE 
BECAUSE HE WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD RIGHT ACROSS THE MOUTH OF THE JUNCTION 
AND IT WAS A CASE OF WE'LL GO OUT AND HAVE A WORD WITH HIM 
YOUNGSON'S GOT ANOTHER RANGE ROVER IT'S CLEARLY OVERTAKEN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD 
HE DOESN'T LIKE DRIVERS WHO IGNORE WARNING MARKINGS OR AS IT HAPPENS RANGE ROVERS 
I CAN'T STAND RANGE ROVERS I THINK THEY'RE BLOODY AWFUL GREAT BIG UGLY THINGS 
HE'S GOING AGAIN HE'S NOT LOOKING IN HIS MIRRORS IS HE 
THERE WON'T BE ANY DISCRETION THIS TIME 
I'D ALREADY DECIDED THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE DEALT WITH BY 
AN ENDORSABLE FIXED PENALTY NOTICE WHICH WAS SIXTY FINE AND THREE POINTS 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO JUST TAKE A SEAT IN THE BACK OF MY CAR PLEASE 
WHEN I STOPPED HIM AND SPOKE TO HIM HE SEEMED FAIRLY SURPRISED AT WHAT HE'D DONE 
TRYING TO CONVINCE HIMSELF HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT 
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY I'VE STOPPED YOU ERM I'VE BEEN SKIPPING ALONG 
YES YOU WERE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD ON A SOLID WHITE LINE OVERTAKING VEHICLES 
I NEVER DO THAT I'M SORRY SIR 
BUT YOU'VE JUST TOLD ME I HAVE SO YES YOU WERE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD OVERTAKING 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN YOU'VE DROPPED DOWN THE HILL 
OH WHERE THAT UM PEOPLE CARRIER WAS 
THAT'S RIGHT YES THE BLACK PEOPLE CARRIER THE KIA 
YES WAS THERE A WHITE LINE THERE THERE'S A SOLID WHITE LINE THERE SIR YES 
I COULD SEE RIGHT ACROSS YES THE REASON THE WHITE LINE IS THERE 
IS BECAUSE THERE'S A JUNCTION WHICH YOU NEVER EVEN SAW I WILL HAVE 
WELL IF MR. AVERAGE DRIVER HAD BEEN COMING TO PULL OUT OF THAT JUNCTION 
HE WOULD HAVE LOOKED TO THE RIGHT SAW IT WAS CLEAR 
AND WOULD HAVE PULLED OUT STRAIGHT INTO YOUR PATH AND I'D HAVE STOPPED 
RANGE ROVER IS PROBABLY IN EXCESS OF TWO TONNE OF WEIGHT 
HE WAS PROBABLY IN EXCESS OF FIFTY M. P. H. 
ANY SMALL CAR PULLING OUT IN FRONT OF THAT WOULD JUST HAVE DISINTEGRATED 
HAVE YOU ANY POINTS ON YOUR LICENCE NO NOT HAD ANY POINTS FOR FORTY YEARS 
O. K. I AM GONNA DEAL WITH YOU WITH AN ENDORSABLE FIXED PENALTY NOTICE 
YOU DO HAVE THE OPTION TO GO TO COURT IF YOU SO WISH 
OBVIOUSLY IF YOU DOUBT THAT THERE IS A WHITE LINE THERE 
I SUGGEST YOU NIP BACK AT THE ROUNDABOUT AND JUST DOUBLE CHECK 
NO ISSUE ME WITH MY TICKET YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO 
HE OPTED ON PROBABLY THE EASIER OPTION AND TOOK THE FIXED PENALTY NOTICE 
YOU HAVE TWENTY EIGHT DAYS IN WHICH TO PAY THE FINE 
IF YOU'D RATHER YOU CAN FILL THE BOTTOM PART AND GO TO BRIDLINGTON MAGISTRATES COURT THANK YOU 
WHEN I WENT TO LET HIM OUT HE WAS SURPRISED THAT HE WAS LOCKED IN 
OH AM I LOCKED IN UNFORTUNATELY SO 
CHILD PROOF YEAH 
IF WE DON'T THEN THE BADDIES TEND TO ESCAPE ON US 
CAN YOU LET THE HANDCUFFS OFF PLEASE 
O. K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE GENTLEMAN WASN'T LOCAL TO THE AREA HE WAS IN A HURRY 
BUT AFTER HE'D BEEN STOPPED BY US THAT HAD CERTAINLY SLOWED HIM DOWN BY ANOTHER TEN MINUTES OR SO 
SO ANY GROUND THAT HE'D MADE UP HE QUICKLY LOST 
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT WHO WHO WHO WHO 
BACK OFF THE A FIFTEEN HELP HAS ARRIVED TO GET THE LOST ROTTWEILER LOCKED UP 
THE ONLY OPTION I HAD REALLY WAS EITHER GET IT IN THE BACK OF THE CAR MYSELF 
AND SECURE IT IN SOME WAY OR ASK FOR A DOG HANDLER TO SEE 
IF HE COULD GET IN THE BACK OF HIS ER 
DOG CAGE AND THEN GET IT BACK TO KENNELS THAT WAY 
WHOSE DOG IS IT DO YOU KNOW 
HE'S A STRAY I THOUGHT IT'D BE EASY JUST TO GET HIM IN THE BACK OF HERE 
BUT AS SOON AS YOU GET HERE HE'S IT'S LIKE RRR 
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY DIFFICULTY 
THERE'S SOMMAT WRONG WITH HIM COS HE'S GOT A LOT OF MUCUS HE'S A BIT SNOTTY ISN'T HE 
ALL I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT IF I TOUCH HIM AND HE'S GOT SOMMAT 
AND I GIVE IT TO MY DOG THAT'S THE ONLY THING I'M CONCERNED ABOUT 
HE NOTICED THE DOG HAD A RUNNY NOSE AND HE CAN'T REALLY TOUCH A DOG 
COS IF HE GIVE IT TO THE POLICE DOG THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT THE POLICE DOG CATCHES WHAT THAT DOG HAS 
WHICH PUTS THE POLICE DOG OUT OF ACTION SO WE LOSE A RESOURCE 
SO UNABLE TO GO IN THE DOG VAN IT'S BACK TO TRYING PLAN A 
WHAT'S THIS 
IT'S EASY TO GET IN A VOLVO IT'S A QUALITY MOTOR 
HE DOESN'T LIKE IT THERE'S NOT MUCH ROOM THERE 
COME ON THEN 
LUCKILY THE PASSER BY HAS GOT AN IDEA 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET IN THE BACK 
WHAT IF YOU PASS TO YOUR MAN YOUR STRAP THROUGH THE CAGE 
WE'VE HAD A BIT OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO GET IT INTO THE CAR 
AND THEN IMPLEMENTED THE CUNNING PLAN 
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT 
CLIP THAT ONE TO THAT ONE AND WE'VE GOT HIM 
WE FED THE LEASH THROUGH THE BACK OF THE METAL CAGE IN THE CAR 
AND THEN WE JUST SORT OF PICKED THE BACK OF THE DOG UP AND ONE OF US PULLED ON THE LEASH 
GOOD LAD GOOD BOY GO ON THEN GOOD BOY 
GOOD BOY COME ON 
GOOD LAD GOOD LAD 
THAT'S IT BACK LEGS UP BACK LEGS UP THERE 
GOOD LAD WE'RE IN 
WHAT'S NEEDED NOW IS A LEAD ON WHO OWNS THE DOG 
IN THE MEANTIME HE'S GOING TO BE SEEN BY THE VETS 
FEW BIKES GET AWAY FROM P. C. DENNIS ON HIS HONDA 
EVEN FEWER WILL GET AWAY FROM HIS BRAND NEW SUZUKI 
IT'S A HAYABUSA A SUPER BIKE WITH A TOP SPEED OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY MILES AN HOUR 
THE HAYABUSA IS A JAPANESE BIRD OF PREY 
A FITTING NAME FOR A PREDATOR OF BAD BIKERS 
FIRST STOP THIS AFTERNOON IS THE LOCAL BIKING CAFE 
TO SHOW VISITORS THE COPS MEAN BUSINESS 
I'LL TAKE THE HAYABUSA TO THE MOTORCYCLE CAFE IT BREAKS DOWN BARRIERS' 
A BIT OF A GIVEAWAY ISN'T IT I'D STRUGGLE TO GET THE SPEED ANYWAY 
IT'S A CULT BIKE PEOPLE WILL BE STOOD ROUND LOOKING AT IT 
SHARP INTAKE OF BREATH IS IT A POLICE BIKE WHY HAVE THEY GOT IT 
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT IT'S GREAT BECAUSE IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO INTERACT WITH THE RIDERS AND TALK ABOUT WHY WE'RE THERE 
HAS IT GOT A CAMERA ON IT THEN YEAH WHICH IS LINKED TO THE VIDEO ON THE BIKE 
EVIDENCE QUALITY AS WELL SO IT COULD BE USED IN COURT IF NEEDS BE 
HOPEFULLY IT JUST PLANTS THAT SEED OF DOUBT THAT 
NEXT TIME THEY OPEN THE THROTTLE NEXT TIME THEY'RE RIDING TOO FAST 
THAT WE MAY JUST BE THERE WATCHING THEM 
THE CAFF IS A GATEWAY TO SOME OF THE BEST MOTORCYCLING ROADS IN THE COUNTRY 
A MECCA FOR BIKERS SOME OF WHOM LIKE TO RIDE THEIR LUCK 
QUITE OFTEN WE FIND THAT SOME MOTORCYCLISTS WILL BE TRYING TO SHOW OFF 
THEY'LL POP A WHEELIE OR DO SOMETHING SILLY IN FRONT OF EVERYONE ELSE JUST TO GET SOME ATTENTION 
BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF DISPLAY THAT P. C. DENNIS IS WITNESSING NEAR THE CAFF TODAY 
I SAW TWO MOTORCYCLISTS COME UP TO THE JUNCTION WAITING TO TURN RIGHT TOWARDS YORK 
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS A CAR PULLED UP BEHIND THEM 
AND AS THE MOTORCYCLISTS PULLED AWAY THE CAR PULLED OUT QUICKLY 
AND TRIED TO CUT THEM UP ALMOST FORCED ONE OF THE BIKES OFF THE ROAD 
THAT'S DANGEROUS DRIVING ON BEHALF OF THE CAR 
BIKE RIDERS ARE NORMALLY VERY WELCOME IN EAST YORKSHIRE 
BUT PERHAPS NOT BY EVERYBODY IT SEEMS 
I SAW THE CAR SWERVE ACROSS THE ROAD WHO FORCED THEM TO CHANGE THEIR PATH MADE THEM SLOW DOWN 
WHAT I'D SEEN IT WAS A DELIBERATE ACT BY THE CAR DRIVER THAT HAD OUTRAGED ME REALLY 
THIS TIME P. C. DENNIS IS STICKING UP FOR HIS FELLOW MOTORCYCLISTS 
MOTORCYCLISTS ARE FLESH AND BLOOD THEY DON'T HAVE A TIN CAN ROUND THEM 
THEY DON'T HAVE THE AIR BAGS AND SEAT BELTS AND CRUMPLE ZONES 
IT WASN'T DONE CARELESSLY IT WAS A DELIBERATE ACT BY THE CAR DRIVER 
EVERYTHING YOU JUST DID WITH THOSE TWO BIKES IS CAUGHT ON THIS VIDEO 
YEAH DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT NO 
YOU DON'T WHAT ABOUT WHAT YOU DID AT THE JUNCTION 
WELL YOU SEE THEY MUST HAVE BEEN WAITING THERE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES 
YEAH FOR THE TRAFFIC TO COME THROUGH I MEAN THEY FLEW PAST ME 
IRRELEVANT AT THE JUNCTION YOU ALMOST HAD ONE OFF 
MANY PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SEE IT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE WHAT THEY DID AND HOW BAD IT IS 
HE WAS WAITING AT A JUNCTION TO PULL OUT HE PULLED OUT AND YOU TOOK A WIDE LINE AND CAUSED HIM TO SWERVE 
HE HAD ENOUGH ROOM ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS TO GET OUT ONTO THE ROAD 
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS BECAUSE HE'D 
THEY WERE GONNA PUT HANG ON BECAUSE HE DIDN'T PULL OUT QUICK ENOUGH YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT 
NO THAT'S CARELESS DRIVING 
I THEN SPOKE TO THE MOTORCYCLISTS FOR THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY 
WHO WAS ON THE K. T. M. MAINE IT WAS YOU YES WE'D BEEN COMING BACK FROM THE SCARBOROUGH AREA 
I WENT TO PASS HIM AND HE SPED UP I WENT TO PASS HIM AGAIN LATER ON AND HE SPED UP AGAIN 
BUT I THOUGHT IT'S O. K. THE ROAD'S CLEAR SO I CARRIED ON 
THEN HE STARTED SWERVING LIKE THIS 
I HAD TO BRAKE REALLY HARD FRIGHTENED ME TO DEATH JUST ACTING LIKE AN IDIOT 
I WAS SERIOUSLY CONTEMPLATING PROSECUTING THE DRIVER OF THE CAR 
TO DO THAT I'LL NEED STATEMENTS FROM THE PAIR OF YOU ARE YOU PREPARED TO GO TO COURT YEAH 
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE YEAH IT'S YOU MORE THAN ME 
HE'S USING HIS CAR TO BULLY ME OFF THE ROAD 
GOING BACK TO THE DRIVER HE HAD HIS OWN ALLEGATIONS HIS OWN STORIES TO SAY ABOUT WHAT'D BEEN GOING ON 
YOU SEE THEY'VE CUT ME UP COMING OVER FROM I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PLACE IS 
I'VE JUST BEEN ON THE BACK OF THEY CUT ME UP GONE PAST ME AND THEN THE DRIVER AT THE BACK 
WHO'S GOT LIKE ORANGE DISCS I THINK THEY ARE ON HIS CAB 
HE'S GONE PAST ME DOING THE SIGN RIGHT 
WHICH I DON'T WHICH I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND 
BECAUSE I MEAN I HAVEN'T BEEN DRIVING 
I'VE BEEN ON MY SIDE OF THE ROAD I MEAN I HAVEN'T BEEN BRAKING EXCESSIVELY OR ANYTHING 
YOU WERE TRYING TO INTIMIDATE HIM YOU WERE USING YOUR CAR TO INTIMIDATE THAT RIDER 
YES BUT I'M PRESUMING THEY'RE GONNA GET OFF THEIR BIKES AND DO SOMETHING TO THE CAR 
THEY SLOWED DOWN FOR ME TO CATCH THEM UP I DON'T KNOW WHY 
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING WITH HIS FEET 
HE'S GONE PAST US ONCE WITH HIS FOOT OUT SHOWING HIS ARMS 
THAT'S BECAUSE AT THE JUNCTION YOU ALMOST FORCED HIM OFF THE ROAD 
I THINK THE WAY YOU'RE DRIVING SIR IS NOT APPROPRIATE 
AND I THINK YOUR ATTITUDE TO MOTORCYCLISTS IS APPALLING 
THE PASSENGER IN THE CAR SUPPORTS THE DRIVER'S SIDE 
I WAS FEELING THREATENED BY THE ACTION OF THOSE MOTORCYCLISTS 
THE ONE WITH THE ORANGE WHEELS WAS COMING PAST US 
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS GIVING THE V. SIGN 
O. K. WE OVERTOOK HIM JACK OVERTOOK HIM AT SAFE PLACES 
ONE THING AND ANOTHER BUT I MEAN THE GUY WITH THE ON THE ORANGE ONE 
HE WAS JUST PROVOKING JACK IF YOU ASK ME 
I'VE GOT A CAR DRIVER AND HIS PASSENGER SAYING ONE THING TWO MOTORCYCLISTS SAYING ANOTHER 
IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THERE WAS MORE TO IT AND THAT THIS HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME 
WHICH IS THE TYPICAL ROAD RAGE INCIDENT SIX OF ONE AND HALF A DOZEN OF THE OTHER 
GUYS THE UNUSUAL SITUATION CALLS FOR SOME UNCONVENTIONAL DIPLOMACY 
EITHER BOTH OF THEM GET PROSECUTED FOR DANGEROUS DRIVING OR CARELESS DRIVING 
OR THEY SHOOK HANDS AND MADE UP 
IT'S ROAD RAGE AND IT'S GOT TO STOP HASN'T IT YEAH 
IN FUTURE IF YOU INTERACT WITH A CAR AND YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY DO STOP PULL OVER LET HIM GO YES 
DON'T CONTINUE 
NEXT TIME DON'T INTERACT WITH BIKES 
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM BECAUSE IT'S ONLY GONNA END UP IN ONE THING AND THAT'S SOMEBODY DYING 
TODAY BOTH OF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN GOING TO COURT FOR CARELESS DRIVING 
WE NEED TO BE A BIT MORE GROWN UP AND FORGET ABOUT IT 
ALL RIGHT YEAH YEAH THINK ON PLEASE 
THEY WERE HAPPY TO TAKE A SLAP ON THE WRIST FOR WANT OF A BETTER TERM 
IT'S NOT THE EASY WAY OUT I DID SEE THE DRIVER OF THE CAR DRIVE DANGEROUSLY 
BUT IT'S SIMILAR TO A DOMESTIC DISPUTE 
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO ALLOW THE PARTIES TO HAVE THEIR OWN SAY 
WITHOUT BEING JUDGE AND JURY 
THE ROTTWEILER WITH THE RUNNY NOSE HAS ARRIVED AT THE VETS IN SCUNTHORPE 
IT'S GOT ALL MUCUS AND SNOT COMING OUT OF ITS NOSE 
ONE OF HIS EARS IS QUITE TENDER RIGHT NO COUGHING ON THE WAY HERE 
THE DOG APPEARS QUITE WELL BEHAVED BUT THE VETS ARE TAKING NO CHANCES 
THEY'RE GOING TO MUZZLE HIM 
IT WAS DURING THAT STAGE THE DOG'S TEMPERAMENT CHANGED EVER SO SLIGHTLY 
QUITE A YOUNG DOG 
WHICH EAR WAS TENDER THAT ONE 
THAT ONE WE THINK O. K. 
ROTTWEILERS CAN BE A REAL HANDFUL 
I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE 
YOU DON'T LIKE ME DO YOU MATE 
O. K. 
SIT 
THERE'S A MILD INFECTION THERE 
UNLIKE HUMANS WHO YOU CAN NORMALLY SEE WINDING THEMSELVES UP DOGS DON'T TEND TO HAVE THAT FACILITY 
THEY JUST TEND TO SNAP AND BITE YOU VERY QUICKLY 
IT'S TURNED INTO A NICE DOG IT SEEMS LIKE 
YEAH A MILD INFECTION WE WILL GIVE HIM AN ANTIBIOTIC INJECTION AND THEN EAR DROPS TO GO HOME ON 
I'M NOT SURE WHO'S GOING TO PUT THEM IN YOU SHOULD BE AT THE FRONT 
YOU'RE USED TO GETTING BITTEN 
DEFINITELY YEAH KEEP HIM AWAY FROM OTHER DOGS 
THE POLICE FOR YEARS HAVE TAKEN IN STRAY DOGS 
IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE DO A BIT LIKE LOST PROPERTY REALLY 
THIS BIT OF LOST PROPERTY IS OFF TO THE KENNEL 
ITS OWNERS HAVE ONLY GOT THREE DAYS TO RECLAIM HIM 
MAYBE CASTRATING IS AN IDEA YEAH 
WE DO RECOVER SOME THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY 
REALLY GOOD LOOKING DOGS FANTASTIC TEMPERAMENT 
UNFORTUNATELY JUST GET TAKEN TO KENNELS AND NEVER GET CLAIMED IT'S ALL RIGHT I'LL DO IT 
THANK YOU 
IT'S NOT JUST THE COUNTRY LANES WHICH ARE DOGGED BY PEOPLE SPEEDING 
SO ARE THE MOTORWAYS 
ON THE M. ONE EIGHTY WHERE FIXED SPEED CAMERAS HAVEN'T YET SPREAD 
P. C. GRAHAM MCNALLY IS AFTER THEM WITH ANOTHER GADGET 
I DO LIKE THAT LITTLE SPOT IT'S MY MOST PRODUCTIVE 
HE'S USING A PRO LASER THREE WHICH FIRES A LASER BEAM AT AN ONCOMING VEHICLE TWO HUNDRED TIMES A SECOND 
BY MEASURING HOW LONG THE PULSES TAKE TO REFLECT BACK ITS SPEED CAN BE ACCURATELY CALCULATED 
IF I GO ON THERE IT NORMALLY TAKES ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES BEFORE 
YOU GET SOMEONE WHO'S TRAVELLING AT GENERALLY OVER NINETY MILES AN HOUR 
AND THIS FINE EVENING IS NO EXCEPTION ON EITHER COUNT 
I HAD BEEN SAT THERE LITERALLY A FEW MINUTES AND THEN THIS LITTLE SILVER CAR APPEARED 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR 
THE CAR'S DOING MORE THAN FIFTY MILES AN HOUR OVER THE SPEED LIMIT 
ALMOST TOO FAST FOR THE CAMERA 
I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE AT FIRST WHAT I SAW 
IT WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILES AN HOUR AND HE CAME FLYING PAST US 
IT WAS A LITTLE VOLKSWAGEN LUPO WHICH IS A REALLY SMALL CAR 
LUPO MEANS WOLF IN ITALIAN 
THE LITTLE V. W. IS MEANT TO BE THE PROVERBIAL WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING 
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE ENGINE WAS PROBABLY SCREAMING FOR HIM TO SLOW DOWN 
I'M SURE HE WANTED TO SEE HOW FAR HE COULD GET BEFORE IT EXPLODED 
IF THAT DOESN'T STOP HIM P. C. MCNALLY SOON WILL 
IF HE CAN CATCH HIM 
THE ROADS WERE NICE AND DRY BUT THE VISIBILITY WAS REALLY HARD IF YOU WERE TRAVELLING WESTBOUND 
YOU'VE GOT THE SUN DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF YOU 
AND ANYTHING COULD BE ON THE CARRIAGEWAY AND YOU WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW IT 
I WAS DOING WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR TO CATCH UP WITH HIM 
IT ONLY TAKES A SMALL AMOUNT OF DEBRIS TO BE ON THE CARRIAGEWAY 
YOU TRY AND AVOID THAT AT THAT SPEED AND YOU'LL SWERVE ALL OVER THE PLACE SPIN AND FLIP 
AND HE COULD QUITE EASILY BE DEAD 
THE LUPO DRIVER HAS SEEN THE WOLF AT THE DOOR HE'S SLOWING DOWN 
IT WAS AFTER THE BRIDGE WHEN I MANAGED TO STOP HIM 
THAT'S A GOOD FEW MILES AWAY FROM WHERE I STARTED 
HELLO YOUNG MAN 
IS THIS YOUR CAR SORRY IS THIS YOUR CAR 
YEAH HAVE YOU GOT YOUR LICENCE YEAH IN YOUR POCKET OR IN THE CAR 
IT'S IN HERE COME AND HAVE A SEAT IN MY CAR 
SPEEDING 
HOW DID YOU GUESS HAVE A SEAT IN THE BACK 
THE YOUNG LAD'S GONE A BIT SHEEPISH 
YOU COULD TELL THAT HE KNEW HE WAS IN THE WRONG AND HE HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN A WAY 
I THINK HE WAS HOPING I HADN'T GOT HIM AT THE SPEED HE DID 
AS YOU GUESSED I'VE STOPPED FOR SPEEDING YEAH 
THIS MACHINE HERE IS CALLED A PRO LASER THREE WHICH IT SAYS ON THE SIDE 
IT'S A HOME OFFICE APPROVED SPEED DETECTION DEVICE I'M AUTHORISED TO USE YEAH 
WHAT SPEED DO YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING 
I DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW 
YOU WERE DRIVING YOUR CAR SO YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT SPEED YOU'RE DOING OVER SEVENTY OVER SEVENTY YEAH 
HAVE A GUESS HOW FAR UP OVER SEVENTY 
NINETY NINETY 
BE HONEST WITH ME WHAT SPEED DO YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING NINETY 
NINETY MAYBE OVER NINETY MAYBE OVER YEAH 
I WANTED TO SEE WHAT HE'D SAY IF HE KNEW WHAT SPEED HE WAS DOING HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO ADMIT IT 
RIGHT THIS DISPLAY HERE WILL SAY WHAT SPEED YOU WERE DOING O. K. RIGHT 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILES AN HOUR REALLY 
IT WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE WHEN I FIRST GOT YOU AND IT DROPPED TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR 
IS THAT BAD 
IS THAT BAD 
I KNOW IT'S BAD BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT'S EXTREMELY BAD FOR YOU 
I HONESTLY WEREN'T LOOKING AM L. BANNED JUST TELL ME THAT 
IT'S NOT UP TO ME IT'S UP TO THE COURTS RIGHT HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DRIVING 
A YEAR A YEAR WE HAVE DISCRETION WE CAN USE IT IF WE WANT TO 
IF PEOPLE ARE HONEST SOMETIMES IF IT'S FOR MINOR OFFENCES WE MIGHT CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS' 
BUT AT THAT SPEED THERE'S NO DISCRETION I COULD USE BECAUSE IT WAS JUST RIDICULOUS 
YOU'LL BE GOING TO COURT RIGHT YOU WON'T BE DRIVING AGAIN UNTIL YOU'VE PASSED YOUR TEST 
AS A NEW DRIVER THE YOUNG MAN FACES NOT ONLY BEING BANNED 
BUT ALSO IF IT'S FOR MORE THAN FIFTY SIX DAYS 
BEING RETURNED TO PROVISIONAL LICENCE STATUS 
PASS ME YOUR DRIVING LICENCE THANK YOU 
I DON'T WANT TO PAINT EVERYONE WITH THE SAME BRUSH 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY BEING A YOUNG DRIVER AND A FAIRLY NEW CAR 
HE'S BEEN THINKING I WONDER WHAT SPEED I CAN DO 
RIGHT THERE'S YOUR DRIVING LICENCE BACK 
I'LL HAVE A QUICK LOOK ROUND YOUR CAR BEFORE I LET YOU GO YEAH 
HE'D GONE FROM OH LOOK AT ME 
TO SUDDENLY THE TOLD OFF SCHOOL BOY THAT WAS IN THE BACK OF MY CAR 
AND HAD TO TELL MUM AND DAD NOW THAT HE'D BEEN A BIT STUPID 
PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE EXPERIENCED COS THEY'VE PASSED THEIR TEST 
DRIVE SAFELY BACK DRIVE SLOWLY AS WELL KEEP TO THE SPEED LIMITS 
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN BYE 
AT HIS AGE AND EXPERIENCE HE HASN'T GOT THE ABILITY TO DRIVE AT THAT SPEED HE'S NOT TRAINED TO DO IT 
SEE YOU MATE 
WITH THE LUPO DRIVER RIDING OFF INTO THE SUNSET WITH HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS 
MCNALLY IS GETTING NEWS OF ANOTHER COLLISION 
GO AHEAD 
JUST GETTING A REPORT OF R. T. C. 
I HAD LITERALLY JUST FINISHED DEALING WITH MY SPEEDER ON THE MOTORWAY 
AND THEN I WAS BEING ASKED TO ATTEND AN ACCIDENT 
A MAN ON A MOTORBIKE HE'S LANDED IN A DITCH 
IT'S A LONG WAY AWAY TEN MILES ACROSS COUNTRY AND INFORMATION IS SKETCHY 
ALL I KNEW IS A MOTORCYCLIST INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT AND THE BIKE WAS IN A DITCH 
I HAD TO GO TO THE NEXT JUNCTION OF THE MOTORWAY AND COME OFF THERE AND TRAVEL DOWN COUNTRY LANES 
AND B. ROADS TO TRY TO GET TO THE LOCATION 
MCNALLY HAS BEEN BEATEN TO THE SCENE BY AN AMBULANCE 
ITS CREW HAVE PICKED UP THE INJURED RIDER HELLO 
AND HAVE THE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED FACIAL INJURIES 
IS THAT IT HIT WITH A PHEASANT QUITE POSSIBLY OH IN THE FACE YEAH 
A FLYING PHEASANT HAS STRUCK HIM IN THE FACE 
ALL RIGHT BRILLIANT LOVELY SEE YOU SOON SEE YOU LATER 
YOU DO GET A LOT OF PHEASANTS THAT DO FLY OUT AND PEOPLE DO UNFORTUNATELY HIT THEM 
THIS POOR MAN HAD TAKEN IT RIGHT IN HIS FACE 
WHEN YOU'RE ON A BIKE IT ISN'T THE BEST OF IDEAS 
ARRIVING ON SCENE EVERYONE ELSE HAD GONE 
APART FROM THE WITNESS THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE BIKE 
THE FIRST RESPONDERS ARE LOCAL VOLUNTEERS WITH FIRST AID TRAINING 
WE SEEN THE BACK END OF THE BIKE IN A DYKE 
AND OUR FIRST INSTINCT WAS TO CHECK THE PERSON OUT FOR INJURIES 
WE WERE MAINLY CONCERNED ABOUT SPINAL YOU GET THAT WITH BIKES 
BUT HE HAD NO SPINAL INJURY NO HEAD INJURIES JUST FACIAL 
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT HE'D GONE THIS SIDE 
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY COMING WHERE THE VAN IS NOW RIGHT 
THE PHEASANT FLEW OUT ACROSS AND HIT HIM STRAIGHT IN THE VISOR HE SWERVED BEHIND THE CAR 
I THOUGHT HE HAD GONE THIS SIDE THEN CAME BACK AND HE WAS DOWN HERE 
HE WAS ACTUALLY UNDERNEATH THAT HE WAS UNDERNEATH IT YEAH 
WHEN YOU'VE ONLY GOT A FEW FEET AWAY THERE'S NOT A LOT YOU CAN DO 
ON TWO WHEELS YOU CAN'T SWERVE TOO MUCH COS YOU'LL COME OFF ANYWAY 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE REGISTRATION NUMBER IS HIS BIKE'S DOWN HERE 
THAT'S HIS BIKE IS THAT HIS VISOR THERE IS NO REGISTRATION IS THERE 
BITS OF BIKE ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT THE BULK OF IT IS INTACT UNLIKE THE PHEASANT 
IT'S A HONDA C. B. L. PROBABLY A SIX HUNDRED 
ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THAT IT MIGHT EVEN BE A. 
CANCEL THAT I THINK IT'S A 
IN A CAR YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CRASH AREAS WHICH CAN ABSORB THE IMPACT 
ON A MOTORBIKE YOU'VE GOT HELMET AND LEATHERS 
GOOD JOB HE MISSED THE TREE 
THE GENTLEMAN WAS HEADING TOWARDS MESSINGHAM 
AS YOU CAN SEE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD HE'S LEFT THE CARRIAGEWAY 
HE'S THEN GONE STRAIGHT INTO THE DITCH WHICH IS QUITE A STEEP DROP REALLY INTO A NARROW DITCH 
NARROWLY MISSING A RATHER SUBSTANTIAL TREE 
AND THE BIKE FELL WITH HIM JUST BEYOND THE TREE 
THAT'S WHERE HE'S BEEN FOUND 
GATE THREE SPENCER'S GARAGE WERE HAPPY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE IT 
IT'S NOT NICE TO RUN AN ANIMAL OVER 
OUT YOU'RE OUT 
PEOPLE DO TRY AND SWERVE TO AVOID THEM 
UNFORTUNATELY IT RESULTS IN A LOT OF ACCIDENTS 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE KNOWN ANYONE BE HIT BY A PHEASANT IN THE VISOR 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT TOOK HIS VISOR STRAIGHT OFF AND CARRIED ON THROUGH THE HELMET INTO HIS FACE 
P. C. MCNALLY IS VISITING THE INJURED RIDER IN HOSPITAL 
TO SEE IF HE REMEMBERS ANYTHING ABOUT HIS ACCIDENT 
HELLO HOW ARE YOU FEELING 
SOUND NOW GREAT DO YOU REMEMBER MUCH WHAT HAPPENED 
YEAH EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
GO ON THEN TELL ME ABOUT IT THE PHEASANT FLEW AT MY HEAD STRAIGHT INTO MY FACE OW 
I HIT IT ABOUT SIXTY MILES AN HOUR 
BROKEN HIS NOSE ACROSS HERE HIS CHEEKBONE 
HIS EYE WAS JUST OUT LIKE THAT 
IT LOOKS A BIT SWOLLEN AND SPLATTERED 
JUST A BIT AFTER IT HIT ME IN THE FACE I COULDN'T SEE A SINGLE THING 
I WAS MORE WORRIED ABOUT HITTING A CAR COMING THE OTHER WAY THAN HITTING THE DITCH 
I DID FEEL REALLY SORRY FOR HIM A NICE NORMAL DAY 
HE'S GONE OUT TO ENJOY HIMSELF ABIDING BY THE SPEED LIMIT 
THEN HE'S TAKEN DOWN BY A PHEASANT HAVE YOU SEEN YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR 
NO WE'LL LEAVE THAT FOR LATER 
I WASN'T VERY PRETTY BEFOREHAND 
IT WON'T PUT ME OFF CYCLING I'LL GET A THICKER VISOR FOR MY HELMET THOUGH 
THE OTHER MOTORCYCLIST WHO CRASHED INTO AN ANIMAL THE HORSE RECOVERED SUFFICIENTLY FROM HIS BROKEN ANKLE 
TO ATTEND A RIDER IMPROVEMENT COURSE AFTER ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCIDENT 
THE BIKER CAUGHT RIDING AT OVER ONE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR WAS FINED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND GIVEN SIX PENALTY POINTS ON HIS LICENCE 
THE YOUNG LAD CAUGHT SPEEDING AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILES PER HOUR 
DID FIND HIMSELF IN TROUBLE AND WAS BANNED FOR FORTY TWO DAYS 
HE WAS ALSO FINED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THE DRIVER OF THE RANGE ROVER 
WHO OVERTOOK ON A DOUBLE WHITE LINE WAS NEVER PROSECUTED 
THE CASE WAS WITHDRAWN AFTER HE WAS LATER SENT TO PRISON FOR TWELVE MONTHS 
FOR SEPARATE OFFENCES INCLUDING PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE 
AND THE STRAY ROTTWEILER TURNED OUT TO HAVE A BITE FAR WORSE THAN HIS BARK 
HE WAS NOT CLAIMED AND AFTER BITING A POLICEMAN AND TWO KENNEL STAFF 
SADLY HAD TO BE PUT TO SLEEP
