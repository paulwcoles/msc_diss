WE'RE NOW JUST OVER HALFWAY INTO OUR EPIC ADVENTURE AROUND THE U. K. COASTLINE 
SO FAR WE'VE TRAVELLED AROUND THE SOUTH AND WEST TAKING IN WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
WE BEGAN ON THE SOUTHEAST COAST OF THE MAINLAND 
NOW WE'VE REACHED THE MOST NORTH WESTERLY POINT 
WE'RE HEADING ALONG ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE AND DRAMATIC 
COASTLINES ON OUR ISLANDS THE NORTH COAST OF SCOTLAND 
THIS IS A SPECTACULAR PART OF THE COUNTRY 
BUT IT'S ALSO A HOSTILE AND A VERY UNFORGIVING PLACE 
TO LIVE ALONG THIS STRETCH OF COAST YOU NEED TO BE RESOURCEFUL AND SELF RELIANT 
EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE HERE IS SHAPED BY THE HARSH ENVIRONMENT AND BY ISOLATION 
THIS IS A PLACE BEYOND THE REACH OF CAPITAL CITIES 
PARTS ARE CLOSER TO THE ARCTIC CIRCLE THAN THEY ARE TO LONDON 
IT'S A WILD LANDSCAPE AND ONE OF THE LEAST POPULATED AREAS OF EUROPE 
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S AN ADVANTAGE TO BE OUT OF THE WAY A FACT THAT HAS 
DRAWN EVERYTHING FROM A NUCLEAR POWER TO NATO ONTO THIS STRETCH OF COAST 
TO HELP ME EXPLORE LIFE ON BRITAIN'S NORTHERN RIM I'M JOINED BY OUR TEAM OF EXPERTS 
NEIL OLIVER EXAMINES HOW THE NOTORIOUS HIGHLAND CLEARANCES 
FORCED AN ENTIRE POPULATION TO LIVE ON THE COAST 
ALICE ROBERTS INVESTIGATES WHAT WENT WRONG 
WITH A DANGEROUS ATOMIC EXPERIMENT AT DOUNREAY 
WE DISCOVER HOW A FAILURE OF OUR COASTAL DEFENCES IN 
THE SECOND WORLD WAR CAUSED THE NAVY TO SUFFER ONE ITS WORST TRAGEDIES 
AND I'LL BE JOINING THE STORNOWAY COASTGUARD 
WHO OPERATE IN SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST EXTREME CONDITIONS 
THIS IS LIFE ON THE EDGE 
OUR JOURNEY TAKES US FROM CAPE WRATH THE MOST NORTH WESTERLY POINT ON THE BRITISH MAINLAND OVER THE SEA TO THE 
OUTER HEBRIDES THEN BACK ALONG THE NORTH COAST TO THE ORKNEY ISLANDS 
THE WONDERFULLY EVOCATIVE NAME CAPE WRATH 
COMES FROM THE NORSE FOR TURNING POINT 
SINCE VIKING TIMES THIS NORTHWEST CORNER'S BEEN A VITAL LANDMARK FOR SAILORS 
A SMALL COMMUNITY LIVED ON THE HEADLAND UNTIL THE NINETEEN FORTIES 
NOW ITS ONLY INHABITANTS ARE RED DEER AND SEA BIRDS 
IT'S THE SITE OF THE HIGHEST SEA CLIFFS IN MAINLAND BRITAIN 
AND ONE OF THE LAST GREAT WILDERNESSES IN EUROPE 
MOST OF THE TIME IT'S A VERY PEACEFUL PLACE BUT NOT TODAY 
IT'S BEING ATTACKED BY THE GERMANS THE AMERICANS AND THE BRITISH 
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MAJOR NATO MILITARY EXERCISE 
FOR OVER SEVENTY YEARS CAPE WRATH HAS BEEN USED AS A FIRING RANGE 
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE IN EUROPE WHERE YOU CAN DROP LIVE ONE ZERO ZERO ZERO L. B. BOMBS 
CAPE WRATH IS THE LARGEST LIVE BOMBING RANGE IN EUROPE 
IT'S USED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND IS CRUCIAL IN THE FINAL TRAINING OF MILITARY PILOTS 
BUT AN EXERCISE LIKE TODAY'S ONLY HAPPENS THREE TIMES A YEAR 
NAVY ARMY AND AIR FORCES FROM AROUND THE WORLD ALL TRAIN TOGETHER 
WARSHIPS JETS ARTILLERY AND HELICOPTERS ARE ALL ATTACKING THIS RUGGED PENINSULA 
COMMANDER MARK ALLIBON IS OVERSEEING THE EXERCISE 
HELLO MARK 
GOOD TO MEET YOU 
WHY CAPE WRATH IT'S UP IN THE TOP LEFT CORNER OF THE BRITISH MAINLAND 
WHY IS IT SO SUITABLE 
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE WHERE WE CAN BRING THREE SERVICES TO TRAIN AT THE SAME TIME 
THERE ARE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE WE CAN DO FAST AIR AND ARTILLERY 
WHERE WE CAN DO MORTARS AND ARTILLERY AND FAST AIR 
BUT IT'S ONLY HERE WE CAN BRING THE NAVAL ELEMENT INTO THAT MIX 
SHIP ONE IS 
THIS EXERCISE IS A FIRST THEY'RE TESTING WHETHER A 
SPECIALLY TRAINED SIX MAN MOBILE UNIT CAN CONTROL ALL OF THE MILITARY'S HARDWARE IN A COORDINATED ATTACK 
WE'RE DEVELOPING A NEWER CONCEPT THAT'S COME OUT OF A LESSON FROM THE LAST GULF WAR IN TERMS OF HOW WE 
CAN MORE EFFICIENTLY EMPLOY ALL THAT FIRE POWER INTO ONE AREA AT THE SAME TIME TO CREATE THE GREATEST EFFECT 
AND MAKING SURE WE WIN THE BATTLE MUCH QUICKER 
WHICH MEANS WE SAVE LIVES AND ALSO WE SPEND LESS MONEY DOING IT 
CAPE WRATH IS AN INHOSPITABLE PLACE 
IS IT IDEAL FOR MILITARY PURPOSES 
IN TERMS OF TRAINING ON THE GROUND IT'S IDEAL 
IT'S PRETTY HOSTILE FOR THE TROOPS TO SURVIVE ON THE GROUND 
IT'S DIFFICULT SEA CONDITIONS FOR THE NAVY AND IT'S DEMANDING TO FLY IN 
IF WE CAN TRAIN WITH LIVE MUNITIONS IN THIS SORT OF ENVIRONMENT AND 
CONTINUE TO COPE WE CAN PROBABLY GO MOST PLACES IN THE WORLD 
THE WETTER WINDIER COLDER THE LESS THE VISIBILITY THE BETTER THE TRAINING'S GOING TO BE 
YES UNLESS YOU'RE PARTICIPATING IN IT 
IT'S DEMANDING FOR THE TROOPS IF THEY CAN SURVIVE IN THAT AND CONTINUE TO OPERATE 
THEN IT'S HUGELY VALUABLE 
THIS COAST IS A TOUGH TEST EVEN FOR THE MILITARY 
FOR THE LOCALS THIS FORMIDABLE ENVIRONMENT IS A DAILY CHALLENGE 
THE NORTH COAST OF SCOTLAND RECEIVES SOME OF THE MOST SEVERE WEATHER IN THE U. K. 
AND NOWHERE IS MORE EXPOSED THAN THE OUTLYING ISLANDS 
I'M ON MY WAY TO BRITAIN'S STORM ALLEY 
THE OUTER HEBRIDES ARE DOTTED WITH ISOLATED SETTLEMENTS 
THE POPULATION OF TWENTY SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IS SPREAD OVER THIRTEEN ISLANDS 
WHEN THE WEATHER TURNS BAD IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE EMERGENCY SERVICES TO REACH LOCATIONS QUICKLY 
THE COASTGUARD SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM PROVIDE A LIFELINE TO THESE SMALL COMMUNITIES 
THAT'S WHY ONE OF THE U. K.'S FOUR COASTGUARD HELICOPTERS OPERATES FROM STORNOWAY ON THE ISLE OF LEWIS 
WE'RE FLYING AT ONE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE OUTER HEBRIDES RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
THIS COASTLINE IS THE FIRST IN THE U. K. TO BE HIT BY WEATHER FRONTS COMING IN FROM THE NORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN 
THESE ISLANDS WERE RECENTLY STRUCK BY THE WORST STORM IN LIVING MEMORY 
WIND SPEEDS REACHED ONE TWENTY FOUR M. P. H. AND CAUSED WIDESPREAD DESTRUCTION THROUGHOUT THE ISLANDS 
JOHN BENTLEY IS A CHIEF PILOT WITH THE STORNOWAY SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM 
THIS HAS BEEN HIS PATCH FOR TEN YEARS 
WHAT DO YOU LOOK OUT FOR WHEN YOU'RE FLYING OFF THE OUTER HEBRIDES 
WORKING AROUND THE COASTLINE ITSELF IT IS A VERY HOSTILE COASTLINE 
IT'S DUE TO THE WEATHER THE SWELL THE ATLANTIC JUST CONSTANTLY BATTERING IT 
REGULARLY HERE SEVENTY EIGHTY MILE AN HOUR WINDS AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S A VERY BLEAK LANDSCAPE 
THERE ISN'T MUCH SURVIVES ON LAND 
THERE ARE VERY FEW LARGE TREES HERE 
IT CAN GO FROM FLAT CALM TO COMPLETELY WILD WHERE IT BECOMES VERY DANGEROUS VERY QUICKLY 
THE COASTGUARD HELICOPTER TEAM COVER TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED MILES OF COASTLINE DEALING 
WITH EVERYTHING FROM ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS TO MEDICAL EMERGENCIES 
THEY ALSO OPERATE UP TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILES OUT INTO THE NORTH ATLANTIC IN SOME OF THE WORLD'S ROUGHEST SEAS 
THE TEAM ARE REGULARLY CALLED OUT TO EVACUATE CREW FROM STRANDED FISHING 
VESSELS EVEN WHEN IT MEANS OPERATING AT THE VERY EDGE OF THEIR FUEL RANGE 
THE FURTHER OUT YOU GO THE SWELL BECOMES LARGER AND MORE CONSISTENT 
THE BIGGEST I'VE SEEN IS PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHTY FOOT SEAS 
EIGHTY FOOT WAVES YEAH EIGHTY FOOT EIGHTY FOOT 
THAT'S PRETTY TERRIFYING 
WE CAN FLY THIS IN PRETTY MUCH THE WORST CONDITIONS 
GENERALLY WE'RE QUITE HAPPY TO GO OUT IN PRETTY MUCH ALL CONDITIONS 
WE KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO WE KNOW WHAT ARE LIMITS ARE AND WE'LL PUSH IT 
RIGHT UP TO OUR LIMITS BUT WE ALSO KNOW WHEN TO STOP 
ON ELEVENTH JANUARY TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE ISLANDS WERE HIT BY WINDS OF OVER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY M. P. H. 
THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED HERE 
THE ATLANTIC STORM STRUCK AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON 
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS DIDN'T LET UP FOR SIXTEEN HOURS 
WHEN THE STORM REACHED ITS PEAK THE HELICOPTER COULDN'T FLY 
GROUNDED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHTEEN YEARS OF OPERATION 
IT WAS UP TO THE COASTGUARD TEAMS ON LAND TO COPE THE BEST THEY COULD 
THE AIR CREW ARE DROPPING ME OFF TO MEET TWO OF THE STORNOWAY COASTGUARD AUXILIARY SERVICE 
THE SERVICE IS MADE UP OF VOLUNTEERS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE 
WILLIE MACRAE OWNS A LOCAL BUILDING FIRM AND DAVE WOOD RUNS A PARCEL DELIVERY SERVICE TO THE ISLANDS' 
THEY WERE ONE OF FIVE TEAMS PATROLLING THE OUTER HEBRIDES ON THE NIGHT OF THE STORM 
WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LIKE COMPARED TO OTHER STORMS YOU'VE BEEN IN 
I'VE NEVER WITNESSED WEATHER LIKE IT IN LEWIS AND I DON'T PARTICULARLY WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN 
IT'S THE WORST WEATHER I'VE EVER SEEN HERE 
THE SEA WAS THE WORST THE TOWN CENTRE WAS DEFINITELY THE MOST HORRENDOUS I'VE EVER SEEN 
I'VE NEVER SEEN WAVES AND SPRAY IT WAS JUST WHITE WATER 
THE HEIGHT OF THESE BUILDINGS 
THE SPRAY WAS BREAKING OVER THE TOP 
OVER THE TOP OF THESE THREE STOREY BUILDINGS YEP 
THE STORM WREAKED HAVOC 
FISHING VESSELS WERE RIPPED FROM THEIR MOORINGS HOUSES FLOODED 
ROADS AND ELECTRICITY CUT OFF 
A STATE OF EMERGENCY WAS DECLARED ON THE NEIGHBOURING ISLAND OF SKYE 
DAVE AND WILLIE WERE OUT ALL NIGHT ASSISTING THE OTHER EMERGENCY SERVICES 
OXYGEN TO AN OLD WOMAN IN A VILLAGE ABOUT TEN MILES OUT OF STORNOWAY 
WE STARTED HELPING THE AMBULANCE BOYS COS THEY WERE WORKING TO CAPACITY 
FOUR O'CLOCK WAS THE DEADLINE 
SHE HAD ENOUGH OXYGEN TO KEEP HER GOING TILL FOUR IN THE MORNING 
SO YOU HAD TO GET THERE WE HAD TO GET THERE 
IT WASN'T LET'S TRY AND GET THERE WE PHYSICALLY HAD TO BE THERE NO OTHER MEANS OF GETTING HER THERE 
WHAT KIND OF QUALITIES DOES 
A COASTGUARD HAVE TO HAVE TO GO OUT ON A NIGHT LIKE THAT 
HE NEEDS TO HAVE NO BRAIN FOR A START 
THAT'S YOUR WAY OF SAYING YOU NEED SOME COURAGE 
IT'S JUST A JOB YOU GET ON AND DO IT 
WHAT DO YOUR FAMILIES THINK 
COS YOU'RE VOLUNTEERS IT'S NOT AS IF YOU'RE FULL PAID UP PROFESSIONALS 
HIS WIFE WAS ANNOYED AT HIM BEING OUT MINE WANTED ME TO STAY OUT LONGER 
CUT OFF FROM THE MAINLAND THE ISLAND'S VOLUNTEER FIRE BRIGADE 
LOCAL POLICE AND AMBULANCE CREWS WERE STRUGGLING TO COPE 
THE COASTGUARD'S ASSISTANCE WAS CRITICAL 
THIS IS STORNOWAY COASTGUARD 
STORNOWAY COASTGUARD 
THE OPERATIONS ROOM IN STORNOWAY BECAME ONE OF THE KEY CONTROL CENTRES 
DUNCAN MACKAY WAS WATCH MANAGER ON THE NIGHT 
WHERE DID THE STORM HIT MOST DRAMATICALLY 
BARRA WAS THE WORST AFFECTED 
WINDS UP TO ONE TWENTY FOUR M. P. H. 
THE UIST AREA WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN AND THEN THE AREA OF LEWIS IN EXCESS OF ONE HUNDRED 
IT WAS ONE OF THE BUSIEST NIGHTS THEY'VE EVER HAD CALLED OUT TO FIVE LIFE THREATENING INCIDENTS 
THE PHONE WAS CONTINUOUSLY RINGING 
NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE CALLS COMING IN 
BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE STORM 
THERE WERE PEOPLE IN TROUBLE ALL OVER THE ISLANDS 
IT WENT ON FOR SO LONG IT NEVER SEEMED TO END GOING ON AND ON 
WE HAD A DEBRIEF ABOUT NINE THIRTY A M. AND WE SAID WELL 
IT'S GONE WELL NO LIVES WERE LOST 
LITTLE DID WE KNOW THAT A FAMILY OF FIVE WERE LOST IN UIST 
NOBODY KNEW AT THAT TIME 
THE ALARM WAS RAISED JUST AFTER TEN A M. 
OVER SIXTY MILES AWAY ON THE ISLAND OF SOUTH UIST THE MCPHERSON FAMILY WERE REPORTED MISSING 
THEY WERE LAST HEARD OF AT SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THE NIGHT OF THE STORM 
WAS BATTERED BY TIDAL WATERS 
BUT THEY NEVER REACHED THEIR DESTINATION 
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY JOINED THE SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM TO COMB THE AREA 
BEV CAMPBELL AND DONALD MACLELLAN THE LOCAL COASTGUARD STATION OFFICERS 
WERE INVOLVED IN THE SEARCH 
THEY KNEW THE MCPHERSONS PERSONALLY 
THE FAMILY WERE COMING ACROSS IN OUR DIRECTION TOWARDS US 
AND THEY WERE TRYING TO GET TO THE BUNGALOW UP HERE ON YOUR RIGHT 
AND THIS IS A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS PLACE BECAUSE THE CAUSEWAY IS QUITE 
HIGH UP WITH WATER ON BOTH SIDES SO 
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN 
SWEPT OFF THE ROAD RIGHT HERE 
JUST AT THIS SPOT HERE 
SO HOW MANY WAS THAT IN ALL 
THAT WAS FIVE PEOPLE IN ALL 
FROM THE SAME FAMILY GRANDFATHER MOTHER FATHER AND TWO CHILDREN 
THREE GENERATIONS THREE GENERATIONS WIPED OUT IN ONE GO 
A VERY SAD OCCASION VERY 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO 
IMAGINE HOW WILD IT WAS THAT NIGHT BECAUSE IT'S SO CALM 
LOOKING AT IT NOW IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE 
BEAUTIFUL AREA TO BRING UP A FAMILY AND YOU JUST CAN'T IMAGINE SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD HAPPEN 
HOPEFULLY WE'LL NEVER HAVE TO EXPERIENCE ANYTHING LIKE IT AGAIN 
THERE'S A FEAR AMONGST LOCALS THAT SUCH WINDS MIGHT STRIKE AGAIN 
RECORDS SHOW THAT THE INCIDENCE OF EXTREME WEATHER HAS DOUBLED IN THE LAST DECADE 
THE RESULT IT'S NOW WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED OF CLIMATE CHANGE 
THE COMMUNITIES OF THE OUTER HEBRIDES LIVE ON THE FRONT LINE 
FOR THESE EXPOSED ISLANDS ALL THAT SEPARATES PEACE AND BEAUTY FROM TRAGEDY IS A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER 
THE INHOSPITABLE NATURE OF THE NORTH COAST MEANS IT'S LARGELY UNTAMED 
ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST ANCIENT LANDSCAPES WITH AN ELEMENTAL 
YET THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE LIVED ALONG HERE FOR AT LEAST FIVE THOUSAND YEARS 
ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE LAND IS BARREN AND INFERTILE 
PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS FOUND WAYS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LIMITED RESOURCES 
HELLO I'M ANGELA MACKAY AND THESE ARE MY KYLE OF TONGUE OYSTERS 
IF YOU WALK INTO SOME OF THE BIG RESTAURANTS IN LONDON 
YOU'LL FIND THESE OYSTERS ON THEIR MENU 
WE STARTED OFF AS A HOBBY 
AND WE'VE GOT SO FOND OF THEM THEY'RE JUST LIKE OUR LITTLE PETS NOW 
WE TALK TO THEM AND 
JUST LIKE PLANTS THEY SEEM TO COME ON 
THAT ONE'S LOVELY A LOT OF MEAT INSIDE IT 
WILL BE VERY NICE AND JUICY THIS TIME OF YEAR 
THE REALLY BIG ONES THEY GO FURTHER NORTH COS PEOPLE LIKE THEM UP HERE 
WE'VE GOT GOOD HEALTHY APPETITES 
I NEVER ATE ONE UNTIL I GREW THEM 
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY INTO OYSTERS JUST COP THEM DOWN AND THAT'S IT 
OOH LOOKS LOVELY DOESN'T IT 
VERY GOOD AS WELL IF YOU HAVE HIGH CHOLESTEROL 
WHAT ELSE YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK THE YOUNG MEN WHY THEY BUY SO MANY OF THEM 
DESPITE THE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT THERE'S A SURPRISING NUMBER OF SETTLEMENTS PERCHED UP HERE ON THE 
NORTHERN EDGE OF SCOTLAND 
THIRTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVE ALONG THIS ONE HUNDRED MILE STRETCH OF COAST 
BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS SO 
THE POPULATION ROSE DRAMATICALLY IN A TUMULTUOUS PERIOD OF JUST FIFTEEN YEARS 
HISTORICALLY NOT MANY PEOPLE CHOSE TO LIVE ON THE NORTH COAST 
THEY WERE FORCED TO A HUGE SOCIAL ENGINEERING PROGRAMME IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS 
COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED THE LANDSCAPE AND THE WAY OF LIFE UP HERE 
HISTORIAN NEIL OLIVER IS INVESTIGATING THIS BRUTAL EPISODE IN SCOTLAND'S PAST 
THIS IS BETTYHILL 
IT'S JUST A SMALL COASTAL VILLAGE BUT ITS VERY EXISTENCE IS A CLUE 
THAT LEADS TWO HUNDRED YEARS BACK INTO THE DARKEST PERIOD OF SCOTTISH HISTORY 
THE EVENTS THAT CREATED THIS PLACE AND SCORES OF OTHERS LIKE IT UP AND DOWN THIS COASTLINE 
HAVE LEFT A DEEP AND PAINFUL SCAR ON THE PEOPLE'S MEMORY 
THEIRS IS A STORY THAT ENDS ON THE COAST BUT THAT STARTS INLAND 
THIS GLEN IS EMPTY NOW BUT STRATHNAVER WAS ONCE HOME TO OVER FIFTY SMALL VILLAGES 
THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVED ALONG HERE 
ALL THAT REMAINS ARE THE OUTLINES OF THEIR HOUSES AND FIELDS 
THEY WERE TENANTS WHO HAD FARMED THIS LAND FOR OVER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS 
IN THE EARLY EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS THAT ALL STOPPED 
THE LANDOWNERS THE MARQUIS OF STAFFORD AND HIS WIFE THE COUNTESS OF SUTHERLAND HAD DONE THEIR SUMS 
SHEEP FARMING WAS MUCH MORE PROFITABLE 
THE TENANTS WOULD HAVE TO GO 
BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FOURTEEN AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THEY FORCIBLY EVICTED AROUND FIVE HUNDRED FAMILIES 
PUSHING THEM OUT TO THE COAST 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS PLACE WAS ONCE A THRIVING BUSY COMMUNITY FOR HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE 
BUT ALL OF THAT WAS SHATTERED BY THE ARRIVAL OF THE LANDLORD'S HENCHMEN 
AXES HAMMERS AND FIRE WERE THE TOOLS OF EVICTION 
AND IT WAS NOTHING LESS THAN THE SYSTEMATIC ERADICATION 
OF A WAY OF LIFE THAT HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
THIS DESOLATE PLACE IS THE PRODUCT OF THE HIGHLAND CLEARANCES 
THE HIGHLAND CLEARANCES SAW ONE OF THE BIGGEST MASS MOVEMENTS OF POPULATION EVER IN BRITAIN 
BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY AROUND A QUARTER OF A MILLION SCOTS 
WERE FORCED OUT OF THEIR HOMES TO MAKE WAY FOR SHEEP 
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED DESCENDANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES DESTROYED IN STRATHNAVER 
HAVE COME TO RETRACE THE FOOTSTEPS OF THEIR ANCESTORS 
WE'RE GOING TO RECREATE THE MARCH FROM THE GLENS TO THE COAST 
I BET THERE HASN'T BEEN THIS MANY PEOPLE ON THIS ROAD FOR MANY A LONG DAY 
THE STRATHNAVER CLEARANCES WERE AMONG THE MOST VICIOUS IN SCOTLAND PUSHED THROUGH AT A FRANTIC PACE 
THIS TWENTY MILE GLEN WAS EMPTIED IN ONLY SEVEN YEARS 
IN JUNE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FOURTEEN THE EVICTIONS STARTED 
THE PEOPLE WERE OUSTED AND THEIR BUILDINGS DESTROYED SO THERE COULD BE NO COMING BACK 
THEY TOOK WHAT POSSESSIONS THEY COULD CARRY AND GATHERED A FINAL HARVEST OF THEIR CROPS 
JIM JOHNSTON IS HEAD TEACHER AT BETTYHILL SCHOOL AND AN EXPERT ON THE STRATHNAVER CLEARANCES' 
HOW MUCH OF A SHOCK WOULD IT HAVE BEEN TO THE PEOPLE LIVING HERE WHEN IT BECAME A REALITY 
THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT HAD BEEN LIVING THERE FOR SOME TIME 
AS FAR AS THEY WERE CONCERNED THIS WAS THEIR HOME 
THEY FELT THEY OWNED IT BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO IT THEY 
HAD NO TITLE TO IT AND THE LANDLORD COULD EJECT THEM AT WILL 
THIS WAS A TREMENDOUS SHOCK IN MORE THAN ONE SENSE BECAUSE 
THEY PREVIOUSLY FELT THE LANDLORD WAS THEIR PROTECTOR 
SEVENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD ALICK JOHN MACKAY'S GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER 
WAS EVICTED FROM STRATHNAVER DURING THE CLEARANCES 
HIS FAMILY WERE FORCED TO MAKE A LIFE ON THE COAST WHERE ALICK JOHN STILL LIVES TODAY 
WHAT IS YOUR FAMILY'S STORY OF THE CLEARANCES 
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM THEY SET FIRE TO THE HOUSES AND JUST TOLD THEM TO GO 
THEY HAD NO ALTERNATIVE ALL THE HOUSES WERE BURNT 
A DESPERATE TIME 
DESPERATE 
WHO COULD THEY TURN TO NOBODY 
FOUR GENERATIONS OF ALICK JOHN'S FAMILY ARE TAKING PART IN THE WALK 
TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR FOREFATHERS 
WE'VE JUST HEARD ABOUT ALL THESE STORIES THROUGH MY GRANDFATHER BUT 
TAKING PART FEELS A BIT MORE REAL AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW OUR FAMILY MUST HAVE FELT 
WHAT GETS ME IS WHEN YOU WERE CLEARED YOU'D HAVE TO GO 
WITH CHILDREN AND THERE'D BE BABIES AND PREGNANT WOMEN 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY AWFUL 
I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE AND 
ELDERLY PEOPLE AS WELL HAVING TO MOVE THEM 
AND SOME FAMILIES THEY 
TOOK THEIR CHILDREN DOWN AND HAD TO GO BACK FOR MORE 
JUST UNBELIEVABLE 
HOW WOULD YOU HAVE FELT IF YOUR FAMILY HAD BEEN EVICTED FROM THEIR NICE HOUSE HOW WOULD YOU FEEL 
WELL I WOULD FEEL SAD BUT I'D ALSO FEEL REALLY ANGRY 
OF COURSE THE INSTIGATOR OF ALL THESE CHANGES THE COUNTESS OF SUTHERLAND 
WAS CONVINCED SHE WAS MODERNISING THE HIGHLANDS NOT DECIMATING THEM 
SHE MAINTAINED HER SCHEME WOULD OFFER THE FARMERS THE CHANCE TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES' 
THAT FIRST VIEW YOU GET 
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST VIEW OF THEIR NEW COASTAL HOME 
IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL TODAY BUT TO FARMERS FROM THE HIGHLANDS IT WAS AN INFERTILE AND ALIEN LAND 
THEY HAD TO SET ABOUT BUILDING HOMES AND A NEW LIFE FROM SCRATCH 
THEY'D BEEN PROMISED THAT THEY WERE GOING SOMEWHERE THAT WAS ALMOST AN IMPROVEMENT ON WHERE 
THEY'D COME FROM BUT THEN HAVING TO START OVER AND NOT KNOWING WHAT 
QUALITY OF LIFE THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT 
THE ESTATE HAD BIG PLANS TO MAKE THE COAST PROFITABLE AND QUADRUPLE ITS INCOME 
TO DEVELOP INDUSTRIES SUCH AS FISHING AND GATHERING KELP 
THEY CLAIMED THEIR TENANTS WERE IDLE AND CORRUPTED BY ALCOHOL 
THAT IT WAS TIME TO SHAKE THEM OUT OF SUBSISTENCE LIVING AND MAKE THEM WORK 
IF YOU LOOK AROUND HERE AT THE LINES OF THE FENCES ALL 
ALONG THERE YOU SEE THAT THEY'RE NOT VERY WIDELY SEPARATED 
THESE WERE ALLOTMENTS LAID OFF IN 
TWO TO THREE ACRE PLOTS SO THAT THESE LOTS WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO ACTUALLY SUSTAIN A FAMILY 
BUT IN THE WORDS OF THE ESTATE TO PINCH TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO LIVE HERE IN THEIR TRADITIONAL WAY 
SO NOT CONTENT WITH FORCING A NEW LIFESTYLE ON THEM THEY DELIBERATELY MADE IT HARDER ANYWAY 
TO FORCE PEOPLE INTO BECOMING MORE INDUSTRIOUS 
TO TRY AND PURSUE FISHING AND OTHER TRADES IF THEY COULD DO THEM 
BUT THE SCHEME FAILED ON THE NORTH COAST 
INLAND FARMERS HAD NO EXPERIENCE OF FISHING 
AND THE ESTATE DIDN'T HELP THEY SPENT THEIR MONEY ON ROADS INSTEAD OF HARBOURS 
CONDITIONS WERE SO BAD MANY LEFT THE COUNTRY ALL TOGETHER 
THEY JOINED THE FLOOD OF NEARLY HALF A MILLION SCOTS HEADING FOR THE NEW WORLD 
AND THE ECONOMIC MIRACLE FROM THE SHEEP FARMING NEVER MATERIALISED 
IRONICALLY SCOTLAND WAS UNABLE TO COMPETE WITH AUSTRALIA 
AND NEW ZEALAND WHERE MANY OF THE CLEARED PEOPLE HAD ENDED UP 
TODAY WAS A BIT SPECIAL 
IT WAS A BIT BIZARRE AS WELL 
IN MY EXPERIENCE THE HIGHLANDS ARE EMPTY PLACES AND TO FIND MYSELF IN THE 
MIDDLE OF A COUPLE OF HUNDRED PEOPLE WALKING ALONG THAT ROAD WAS UNIQUE 
AND IT REMINDED ME THAT THE HIGHLANDS WEREN'T ALWAYS EMPTY THEY WERE MADE THAT WAY 
THE HIGHLAND CLEARANCES WERE LIKE 
A CENTRIFUGE THAT SPUN AND THREW EVERYBODY OUT TO THE RIM 
AND THEY CHANGED THE COASTLINE HERE FOREVER AND MADE IT THE WAY IT IS TODAY 
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO STAYED AFTER THE CLEARANCES THE COAST BECAME A WAY OF LIFE 
MOST TOOK UP SMALL SCALE FISHING AND FARMING 
COTTAGE INDUSTRIES HAVE GROWN UP TOO AND THE REGION'S BECOME A POPULAR SPOT FOR FUGITIVES FROM THE RAT RACE 
THE LOCAL ECONOMY ALSO GETS A MUCH NEEDED BOOST FROM TOURISM AND IT'S EASY TO SEE THE ATTRACTION 
ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS ABOUT MAKING THIS JOURNEY 
IS THE SHEER NUMBER OF WONDERS AROUND EVERY CORNER 
IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO GET UP HERE BUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF VISITORS 
MAKE THE EFFORT AND ENJOY WHAT SCOTLAND'S NORTH COAST HAS TO OFFER 
BEAUTY THOUGH IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER 
HI I'M LIAM MACKAY I'M FOURTEEN I LIVE IN PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORST PLACES TO LIVE 
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO BUT STAND AROUND THE TOILET BLOCKS 
TOURISTS COME AND GO TO THE BEACHES THEY THINK IT'S LOVELY 
BUT FOR US IT'S NOT WE'RE TOO USED TO IT IT'S BORING 
THEY'RE OLDER THAN US 
AND THEY'VE READ ABOUT IT BUT THEY HAVEN'T ACTUALLY LIVED HERE 
THEY SAY THERE'S PLENTY OF HILLS TO RUN ABOUT ON 
WHAT'S TO DO ON A HILL 
PEOPLE GET REALLY ANNOYED BECAUSE WE 
ANNOY THEM BY DOING STUFF LIKE KNOCKING ON THEIR HOUSES AND RUNNING 
IT'S ONLY COS WE'VE GOT NOTHING TO DO IF THEY DID SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THAT WOULD STOP 
THEY WOULD COMPLAIN AND SAY IT'S JUST UPSETTING FOR THE TOURISTS 
WE DON'T CARE FOR THE TOURISTS WE JUST WANT SOMETHING TO DO 
KEEP FOLLOWING THAT ROAD YOU'LL GET TO IT 
PEOPLE STOP AND ASK DIRECTIONS 
WE HAVE GREAT CRAIC GIVING WRONG DIRECTIONS 
END UP WASTING ALL THEIR FUEL 
AND GAINING THEIR MILEAGE FOR NO REASON AT ALL 
IT'S GOOD FOR A CHEAP LAUGH 
THE BEST THING TO DO IS SIT HERE AND STARE AT WALLS 
THAT'S IT 
THAT'S OUR LIFE STORY 
THAT'S OUR LIFE STORY STARE AT WALLS 
HOLDING ON TO THE YOUNGER GENERATION IS A CHALLENGE FOR REMOTE COASTAL COMMUNITIES 
THE DRAW OF THE CITIES AND BETTER JOB OPPORTUNITIES INVARIABLY PROVES TOO MUCH 
FIFTY YEARS AGO THE SITUATION WAS EVEN WORSE 
THE MECHANISATION OF FARMING WAS PUTTING PEOPLE OUT OF WORK 
AND THE ALTERNATIVE TRADES WERE ON THE DECLINE 
THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW EXPERIMENTAL INDUSTRY WAS WELCOMED 
BY THIS ISOLATED REGION DESPERATE FOR NEW JOBS 
IRONICALLY IT WAS THE VERY REMOTENESS OF THIS COAST THAT MADE IT 
THE IDEAL TEST SITE IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES FOR A RADICAL NEW TECHNOLOGY 
IT WAS A PROJECT THAT MIGHT HAVE SAVED THE AREA ECONOMICALLY BUT IT HAS ALSO BEEN PLAGUED BY CONTROVERSY 
DOUNREAY'S DOME IS A POTENT SYMBOL ONCE A FUTURISTIC PROMISE OF THE NUCLEAR AGE 
BUT THE PLANT HAS ALSO CONFIRMED SOME OF OUR WORST FEARS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF THE ATOMIC INDUSTRY 
ALICE ROBERTS IS EXPLORING ITS CHEQUERED HISTORY 
THIS REMOTE LOCATION WAS THE SITE 
FOR A UNIQUE EXPERIMENT INTO NUCLEAR ENERGY 
THE PLANT CLOSED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
IT'S NOW IN THE PROCESS OF BEING DECOMMISSIONED 
I'VE COME TO FIND OUT WHAT SECRETS ARE BEING EXPOSED AS IT'S BEING DISMANTLED 
VERY FEW PEOPLE GET TO SEE INSIDE THE FAMOUS DOME OF DISCOVERY 
MIKE BROWN IS IN CHARGE OF DECOMMISSIONING THE REACTOR 
IT'S ENORMOUS WELL THIS IS DOUNREAY FAST REACTOR QUITE A LANDMARK IN THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND 
YEAH IT STARTED CONSTRUCTION ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE I WAS BORN BACK IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE 
THEY WEREN'T SURE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH IT SO THEY BUILT IT IN 
A LARGE PRESSURE VESSEL WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE IN NOW AND 
THEY BUILT IT WELL AWAY FROM EVERYBODY ELSE 
THIS IS TO CONTAIN ANYTHING 
IF ANYTHING WENT WRONG THIS WOULD CONTAIN THE RADIOACTIVITY 
IT WAS PIONEERING OF ITS TIME WASN'T IT 
ABSOLUTELY THEY WERE RIGHT AT THE FOREFRONT OF TECHNOLOGY 
WAS IT BRITAIN'S FIRST FAST BREEDER REACTOR 
THIS IS THE FIRST ELECTRICITY PRODUCING FAST BREEDER REACTOR IN THE WORLD 
ATOMIC POWER WAS IN ITS INFANCY WHEN DOUNREAY WAS BUILT IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
URANIUM TO FUEL REACTORS WAS SCARCE 
THE FAST BREEDER PROGRAMME WAS REVOLUTIONARY 
IT WOULD USE URANIUM MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN EXISTING THERMAL 
REACTORS AND COULD ALSO BREED ANOTHER FUEL SOURCE PLUTONIUM 
THE DREAM WAS ELECTRICITY TOO CHEAP TO BE METERED 
MIKE THAT'S THE REACTOR DOWN THERE 
THAT'S IT YES 
IN THEORY NUCLEAR REACTORS ARE EXTREMELY SIMPLE 
ALL WE REALLY WANT TO DO IS TO PRODUCE A LOT OF HEAT TO MAKE ELECTRICITY 
AN AWFUL LOT OF HEAT 
THE SIZE OF A DUSTBIN YET 
IT PRODUCES SIXTY MEGAWATTS 
SIXTY THOUSAND ELECTRIC FIRES 
THE DOME'S REACTOR PROVED THAT THE TECHNOLOGY WORKED AND WAS HAILED AS A SUCCESS 
IT WAS PRIMARILY A RESEARCH SITE BUT WENT ON TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS 
BUT THE FAST BREEDER PROGRAMME PROVED A DEAD END 
THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED IT WASN'T COST EFFECTIVE 
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THE CLEAR UP OPERATION 
WILL TAKE AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS AND WILL COST AROUND THREE BILLION 
IT'S ALL A BIT IRONIC BECAUSE THEY BUILT THE WHOLE SYSTEM 
IN ABOUT THREE YEARS AND IT'S TAKING US THIRTY TO GET RID OF IT 
WHEN THEY BUILT THE REACTOR THEY HAD NO IDEA ABOUT TAKING IT APART THEY WEREN'T WORRIED ABOUT THAT 
AND PRESUMABLY HADN'T CONSIDERED THE PROBLEM OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE 
THEY HADN'T BOTHERED ABOUT ANY OF THESE FACTORS 
I'M GOING THROUGH A SERIES OF FAIRLY TIGHT SAFETY PROCEDURES 
WHILE INSIDE THE DOME I'VE BEEN WEARING VARIOUS BADGES RECORDING 
THE AMOUNT OF RADIOACTIVITY I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO 
FINALLY I'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH THIS MACHINE WHICH WILL MONITOR 
THE RADIOACTIVITY ON ME AND TELL ME IF I'M ALLOWED TO LEAVE 
I'M HOPING I'LL BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE AND I'M NOT RADIOACTIVE 
I I. IIIT II IIITII 
ASSUME FORWARD MONITORING POSITION 
I THE SECOND II 
I. IIIT II IIITII 
BACKWARD MONITORING POSITION 
OH FANTASTIC I THE SECOND IIIT II I IT 
THE SECOND I I IL I 
THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE DOUNREAY HAS BEEN DOGGED BY PROBLEMS 
ENOUGH URANIUM TO PRODUCE TWELVE ATOM BOMBS WENT MISSING IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
A SHAFT USED TO DUMP HIGHLY DANGEROUS NUCLEAR WASTE EXPLODED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
NOW THE FORESHORE OF THE SITE IS CONTAMINATED WITH RADIOACTIVE WASTE 
AND JUST ALONG THE COAST THEY'VE PAID A PRICE FOR BEING LOCATED NEXT TO A NUCLEAR EXPERIMENT 
GEOFFREY MINTER BOUGHT SANDSIDE ESTATE IN NINETEEN NINETY ONLY TO FIND OUT 
SEVEN YEARS LATER THAT HIS BEACH HAD RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BEACH 
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM 
THE PROBLEM IS RADIOACTIVE METALLIC PARTICLES 
AND IF ONE WERE TO LODGE IN ANY PART OF 
THE BODY HUMAN OR ANIMAL 
IT COULD HAVE A VERY SERIOUS EFFECT 
THESE ARE LIKE RED HOT PIECES OF COAL THAT CARRY ON BURNING FOR THREE HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE 
HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU FOUND OUT 
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN ANGRY 
I WAS VERY SHOCKED 
I KNOW YOU CAN SAY IF YOU BUY NEXT DOOR TO A NUCLEAR ESTABLISHMENT YOU CAN EXPECT A PROBLEM 
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD EXPECT A PROBLEM NOR ANYONE ELSE 
QUITE THE REVERSE I WOULD EXPECT IT TO BE 
VERY CAREFULLY CONTAINED 
IT'S LACK OF CONTAINMENT THAT HAS CAUSED THIS ISSUE 
DO YOU GO ON YOUR BEACH 
NO I DON'T 
IT DOES CONCERN ME 
NOBODY REALLY KNOWS TOO MUCH ABOUT THESE THINGS 
WE HAD TWO DOGS WHICH WE USED TO WALK ON THE BEACH EVERY DAY AND THEY BOTH SUDDENLY DIED FROM TUMOURS 
I CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING 
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE RISK 
OVER FIFTY RADIOACTIVE PARTICLES HAVE NOW BEEN FOUND ON GEOFFREY'S BEACH 
THE U. K. ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY ADMITS THERE MAY BE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM OUT AT SEA 
MARK MURRAY IS DOUNREAY'S TECHNICAL ADVISOR ON DECOMMISSIONING 
AS FAR AS WE'RE AWARE THERE'S A CACHE OF PARTICLES JUST OFF SHORE 
AND IT WAS 
LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE THROUGH THE SITE DRAINAGE 
BACK IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND NINETEEN SIXTIES WHEN THEY DIDN'T 
NOT CARE BUT DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES TO THEIR ACTIONS 
NOW WE ARE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY AND SAYING RIGHT WE'VE DONE THIS 
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO CLEAN IT UP 
IT'S LEFT YOU WITH AN IMMENSELY EXPENSIVE LEGACY OF CLEANING UP 
YES AND WE CAN'T SHY AWAY FROM THAT WE'VE GOT AN OBLIGATION 
WE BUILT AND OPERATED THIS SITE SO WE'VE GOT AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE LEAVE THIS SITE 
IT'S IN AN ACCEPTABLE FORM THAT PEOPLE CAN WANDER INTO HERE WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF CONTAMINATION 
BUT THERE'S NO EASY SOLUTION TO THE LEAKED NUCLEAR MATERIAL 
RADIOACTIVE DEBRIS IS NOW PRESENT IN THE SEABED 
AND THIS MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACK DOWN AND CONTAIN 
HERBIE LYALL WORKED AT DOUNREAY AS A HEALTH AND SAFETY OFFICER FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS 
HE LED THE TEAM WHO DISCOVERED THE VERY FIRST PARTICLE ON GEOFFREY'S BEACH 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE WAY DOUNREAY HAS DEALT WITH THE WASTE OVER THE YEARS 
WELL I'M DON'T WANT TO SAY IT WAS RUBBISH 
BUT IT WAS RUBBISH HONESTLY 
THEY JUST DIDN'T CARE LONG AS THEY GOT RID OF IT OUT OF THEIR PLANT 
I GET THE FEELING PEOPLE IN THIS AREA FEEL QUITE A LOT OF LOYALTY TO DOUNREAY 
IT'S A BIG EMPLOYER 
DON'T GET ME WRONG DOUNREAY WAS A GOOD EMPLOYER 
IT WAS THE COWBOYS IN DOUNREAY THAT BUGGERED THE PLACE 
THIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW THIS BEACH IS CONTAMINATED 
IT'S A GREAT PITY BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE INDUSTRY 
AS FAR AS THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY WAS CONCERNED 
THE REACTORS RAN PERFECTLY 
THE PROBLEM WAS WHEN IT CAME TO WASTE 
THEY NEVER EVER CONSIDERED HOW MUCH A PROBLEM IT WOULD BE THE WASTE 
I THINK THAT APPLIES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND THE INDUSTRY 
THEY SHOULD HAVE LOOKED AT BEFORE THEY STARTED 
BUILDING THE PLACE WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH THE RUBBISH 
BUT THEY DIDN'T DO THAT 
OVER THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED YEARS BRITAIN WILL PRODUCE ENOUGH RADIOACTIVE WASTE TO FILL THE ALBERT HALL FIVE TIMES 
AND THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE ANY NEW POWER STATIONS THAT MAY BE BUILT 
WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL TWO THOUSAND SIX BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT 
WILL ANNOUNCE ITS LONG TERM SOLUTION TO THE NUCLEAR WASTE PROBLEM 
WE'VE COME ALMOST TWENTY MILES FROM DOUNREAY TO DUNNET BAY 
EVEN THIS BEAUTIFUL BEACH HASN'T ESCAPED THE NUCLEAR PLANT'S REACH 
THEY'VE RECENTLY DISCOVERED A CONTAMINATED PARTICLE HERE TOO 
THE BEACH IS NEXT TO THURSO REEF ONE OF THE TOP TWENTY SURF SPOTS IN THE WORLD 
HI I'M ANDY BAIN AND I LIVE TO SURF 
SURFING'S PERSONAL 
YOU'RE AT ONE WITH THE OCEAN 
WHEN YOU'RE RIDING A WAVE THIS WAVE HAS TRAVELLED POSSIBLY TWO THOUSAND MILES AWAY 
THIS STORM HAS TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE ATLANTIC TO THE NORTH 
AND HERE YOU ARE JUST SURFING THIS ONE WAVE SUDDENLY IT COMES TO THE END OF ITS LIFE ON THURSO REEF 
THURSO'S SPECIAL FOR SURFING BECAUSE OF THE SWELL PATTERNS AND THE WINDOW WE HAVE 
COS THE REEFS ON THE NORTH COAST 
AND BECAUSE IT'S QUITE DEEP AS WELL THE SWELL JUST STANDS UP 
THROWS OUT AND BARRELS AND ENDS UP ROLLING ALL THE WAY INTO THE ROCKS 
THE THURSO BEAST 
LIKE THESE HUGE WAVES THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL NOT TACKLE 
IT SORTS THE MEN OUT FROM THE BOYS 
IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT GOOD THEN WHY GO ELSEWHERE 
THE BEST THING IS THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT COME HERE 
REMOTE AS IT FEELS TODAY THE ATLANTIC SEAWAYS AROUND 
HERE WERE ONCE THE VIKING EQUIVALENT OF A MOTORWAY 
ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO THEY WERE PART OF THE GREAT TRADING ROUTE BETWEEN NORWAY AND IRELAND 
THE NORTH COAST WAS A KEY PART OF THE VIKING EMPIRE AND REMAINED UNDER SCANDINAVIAN CONTROL FOR SIX HUNDRED YEARS 
LONG AFTER THE VIKINGS HAD GONE IT REMAINED A PLACE OF VITAL STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE 
THIS IS DUNNET HEAD THE MOST NORTHERLY POINT ON THE BRITISH MAINLAND 
FURTHER NORTH BUT LESS FAMOUS THAN ITS NEIGHBOUR JOHN O'GROATS 
ONCE YOU'RE HERE IT'S EASY TO FEEL REMOVED FROM WORLD AFFAIRS BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS 
DURING WORLD WAR ONE AND THE SECOND THE MAIN BASE FOR THE BRITISH NAVY 
WAS JUST A FEW MILES NORTH OF HERE ON THE ORKNEY ISLANDS 
SCAPA FLOW IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST NATURAL HARBOURS IN THE WORLD 
A FIFTEEN MILE LONG AND EIGHT MILE WIDE OPEN LAGOON 
REMOTE AND SHELTERED IT WAS AN EXCELLENT STRATEGIC BASE FROM WHICH 
THE ROYAL NAVY COULD MAKE SWEEPS OF THE ATLANTIC IN SEARCH OF THE ENEMY 
IT REMAINED IMPREGNABLE THROUGHOUT WWI 
AT THE END OF THE WAR THE GERMAN NAVY SURRENDERED AND THEIR ENTIRE FLEET SCUTTLED IN NINETEEN NINETEEN 
BY THE START OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR THE BRITISH NAVY WAS AGAIN BASED IN ORKNEY 
AS THE BATTLE FOR THE ATLANTIC RESUMED NAVAL HEADQUARTERS IN SCAPA FLOW WERE A PRIME TARGET 
VIGILANCE WAS NEEDED ALL ALONG THE NORTH COAST 
HERE AT DUNNET HEAD THESE CONCRETE OUTPOSTS ARE THE REMAINS OF A WORLD WAR TWO RADAR STATION 
ITS JOB WAS TO SCAN NOT ONLY THE SKIES BUT ALSO 
THE SEAS FOR GERMAN U. BOATS TRYING TO BREAK OUT OF THE NORTH SEA OVER THERE THROUGH TO THE ATLANTIC OVER THERE 
BUT IT WAS BUILT TOO LATE TO AVERT ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISASTERS IN BRITISH MARITIME HISTORY 
NEIL OLIVER IS ON HIS WAY TO ORKNEY TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MEN AND BOYS 
WHO DIED ON THE BATTLESHIP H. M. S. ROYAL OAK 
I VIVIDLY REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THE NAME SCAPA FLOW 
I WAS A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD SCHOOL BOY 
BECAUSE OF THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE THERE 
THE NAME HAS ALWAYS RESONATED TO ME WITH FEELINGS OF THE COLD DARK SEA 
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN TO ORKNEY BEFORE 
AND I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO ATTEND THE SIXTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SINKING OF THE ROYAL OAK BATTLESHIP 
ARTHUR SMITH AND KENNETH TOOP SERVED AS BOY SEAMEN ONBOARD H. M. S. ROYAL OAK 
THEY'RE AMONG ONLY TWELVE SURVIVORS OF THE BIGGEST LOSS OF LIFE 
EVER INFLICTED ON THE ROYAL NAVY IN HOME WATERS 
HAVE YOU BEEN ON THIS ROUTE BEFORE 
NO I HAVEN'T BEEN BACK HERE FOR SIXTY FOUR YEARS MATE 
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU WAS WHEN I LEFT THE MANCHESTER IN FEBRUARY FORTY FIRST 
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH 
I'M HOPING THEY CAN HELP ME PIECE TOGETHER THE EVENTS OF THAT ILL FATED NIGHT IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
HOW'S IT GOING CHEWING OVER MEMORIES 
VERY EMOTIONAL THIS MEMORIAL THING 
YOU DON'T THINK OF THEM TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK SOMETIMES NOT FOR MONTHS ON END 
QUITE HONESTLY IT WAS SIXTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
AND IT'S AS PLAIN NOW IN MY MIND AS IT WAS THE NIGHT IT HAPPENED 
ON THE NIGHT OF FRIDAY THIRTEENTH OCTOBER NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
H. M. S. ROYAL OAK WAS THE ONLY BRITISH BATTLESHIP IN SCAPA FLOW 
THE REST OF THE FLEET HAD LEFT DAYS BEFORE WORRIED ABOUT THE THREAT OF AIR ATTACKS 
ROYAL OAK STAYED BEHIND TO PROVIDE ANTI AIRCRAFT COVER FOR ORKNEY 
W. W. I. I. WAS ONLY SIX WEEKS OLD 
ARTHUR SMITH AND KENNETH TOOP HAD BEEN ONBOARD ROYAL OAK SINCE WAR WAS DECLARED 
THEY WERE SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE 
I CAN HEAR THE NOISE NOW 
I CAN HEAR EVERYBODY YELLING 
IT WAS JUST LIKE THIS COLD AND DARK 
VERY DARK VERY COLD 
I WENT ON WATCH AT MIDNIGHT 
WHEN I ARRIVED THERE I WAS DETAILED OFF FOR AIRCRAFT LOOKOUT 
I'D BEEN UP THERE ABOUT AN HOUR 
WHEN THERE WAS AN ALMIGHTY EXPLOSION RIGHT BENEATH ME 
THE SHIP GAVE A BIT OF A JUMP 
THE PORT ANCHOR RAN OUT AND IT WENT OUT AT SUCH A RATE AND IT MADE SUCH A NOISE 
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE NOISE THE CABLE MADE 
ACTION STATION SOUND AND THE CREW WERE ALL GUESSING AMONGST THEMSELVES WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING ON 
SOME THOUGHT IT WAS AN INTERNAL EXPLOSION I VOLUNTEERED THE INFORMATION IT WAS A TORPEDO 
FOR WHICH I GOT A CLIP ROUND THE EAR AND TOLD TO SHUT UP DON'T BE 
STUPID SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO WE'RE IN SCAPA FLOW HOW THE HELL CAN THERE BE A TORPEDO 
I WAS ASLEEP IN MY HAMMOCK BUT MY MATE MACARTHY WHO WAS 
SLEEPING NEXT TO ME SHOOK ME AND SAID 
THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENED YOU'D BETTER GET OUT 
AND THEN WE WERE HIT THREE TIMES WOP WOP WOP 
AND THE SHIP IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO LIST 
THEN THE ORDER CAME ABANDON SHIP 
I DIVED IN THE SEA CLOTHES BOOTS THE LOT ON 
WHEN EVERYBODY'S IN DANGER OF RISKING THEIR LIVES 
THERE'S NOBODY TO GIVE ORDERS 
THE MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS AND FIRE SWEPT THROUGH THE SHIP 
TANNOY SYSTEMS EVERYTHING HAS GONE 
IT'S YOU'RE COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN 
I DECIDED THE ONLY THING TO DO WAS TO STRIKE OUT FOR SHORE 
BUT IN FACT I WAS GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND SWIMMING TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF SCAPA FLOW 
YOU JUST SWIM BECAUSE YOU KNOW THIS IS THE ONLY HOPE YOU'VE GOT 
IN TIME YOU'RE IN A STATE OF SUCH WRETCHEDNESS YOU'RE ALMOST IN DESPAIR REALLY 
AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T SWIM FOREVER 
I HEARD SPLASHING ALONGSIDE ME ANOTHER SWIMMER 
WE DECIDED TO SWIM IN TANDEM SHORE SIDE 
SUDDENLY HE SAID BOLLOCKS TO THIS 
AND DISAPPEARED UNDER THE WATER 
NOW THAT FRIGHTENED ME IT REALLY WAS THE MOST FRIGHTENING PART OF THE WHOLE LOT I THINK 
I'M SO THANKFUL NOW THAT I MADE IT 
SO SORRY THAT SO MANY DIDN'T BUT OF COURSE 
IT CHANGES NOTHING DOES IT 
THE NEXT MORNING THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES WERE AT A LOSS AS TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED 
SOME THOUGHT IT WAS ONBOARD SABOTAGE OR AN ACCIDENTAL EXPLOSION 
FEW COULD BRING THEMSELVES TO CONSIDER 
THAT THE UNBREACHABLE SCAPA FLOW COULD HAVE BEEN INVADED BY A U. BOAT 
I'M ON MY WAY NOW TO SPEAK TO A MAN WHO GOT HIS HANDS ON SOME COLD HARD EVIDENCE 
HE WAS IF YOU LIKE THE ACCIDENT SITE INVESTIGATOR 
HE WAS THE FIRST MAN TO GO BENEATH THE WAVES AND TOUCH THE HULL OF THE ROYAL OAK AFTER IT SANK 
HE WAS ABLE TO SEE WITH HIS OWN EYES WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE SHIP 
FORMER DIVER SANDY ROBERTSON STILL LIVES IN ORKNEY 
SANDY 
NOW NINETY FIVE YEARS OLD I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE CAN REMEMBER OF EVENTS SIXTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
SO WHEN YOU WENT DOWN WHAT DID YOU SEE 
OH BODIES DEAD BODIES 
IT WAS NINETEEN FATHOM OF WATER BUT IT WAS JUST AS CLEAR AS A BELL 
IT'S NOT NICE 
TO BE THERE BUT YOU CAN'T HELP IT 
SOMEBODY GOT TO DO IT 
WHAT WERE YOU ABLE TO FIND THAT ENABLED YOU TO PIECE TOGETHER WHAT HAD SUNK THE SHIP 
WHAT EVIDENCE DID YOU FIND 
OH THREE BIG HOLES IN THE SIDE IN THE TEENS OF FEET WIDE 
THREE BIG HOLES CLOSE TOGETHER 
YOU COULD SEE THREE TORPEDOES 
SHINING BRONZE PROPELLERS SHINING 
BRITISH PROPELLERS ARE BLACK 
WE PICKED THEM UP AND TOOK THEM IN AND HANDED THEM OVER TO THE NAVY 
WE SAID THERE YOU ARE 
BUT THEY JUST DIDN'T 
THE NAVY JUST COULDN'T REALISE OR TAKE IT IN THAT A TORPEDO GOT INTO SCAPA FLOW 
BY THE TIME SANDY PRODUCED HIS EVIDENCE THE CREW OF U. FORTY SEVEN WERE RETURNING HOME TO A HEROES' WELCOME 
ITS LEADER COMMANDER GUNTHER PRIEN WAS BEING NICKNAMED THE BULL OF SCAPA FLOW 
HITLER AWARDED HIM THE FIRST EVER KNIGHT CROSS 
AND DESCRIBED THE MISSION AS THE PROUDEST DEED THAT A GERMAN U. BOAT COULD POSSIBLY CARRY OUT 
PRIEN HAD BEEN HAND PICKED TO ACHIEVE THE IMPOSSIBLE 
AND PENETRATE THE DEFENCES OF THE ROYAL NAVY'S HOME BASE 
GERMAN INTELLIGENCE HAD FOUND THAT OF THE SEVEN ENTRANCES INTO SCAPA FLOW 
ONE WAS PROTECTED BY ONLY TWO SUNKEN SHIPS 
PRIEN MANOEUVRED HIS WAY THROUGH AND STRUCK AT THE HEART OF THE BRITISH FLEET 
EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THREE OF THE ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED CREW DIED THAT NIGHT 
MANY OF THE SURVIVORS RETURNED TO ACTIVE SERVICE IN SCAPA FLOW ONLY A MONTH LATER 
AND IT REMAINED THE NAVY'S MAIN BASE FOR THE REST OF THE WAR 
OVER SIXTY YEARS ON SURVIVORS SERVICEMEN 
AND FAMILIES STILL ATTEND THE ANNUAL MEMORIAL SERVICE IN ORKNEY 
ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTEENTH OF OCTOBER NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
NO ONE COULD BELIEVE IT 
BUT THE GRIM EVIDENCE WAS THERE ALONG WITH THE SURVIVORS 
THE ROYAL OAK IS NEVER FAR FROM ORKADIANS' MINDS 
WE WERE HERE AT THE BEGINNING YOU MAY SAY 
AND WE'RE STILL HERE PERHAPS WE FEEL A BIT GUILTY THAT IT HAPPENED ON OUR DOORSTEP 
SO THERE'S NOT MANY DAYS GO BY THAT WE DON'T REMEMBER THE ROYAL OAK 
TODAY A WRECK BUOY MARKS THE WAR GRAVE WHERE H. M. S. ROYAL OAK RESTS 
EVERY YEAR NAVY DIVERS DESCEND TO THE SHIP AND RAISE A WHITE ENSIGN IN REMEMBRANCE OF FALLEN COMRADES 
THIS COAST HAS BEEN AS TRAGIC AS IT IS SPECTACULAR 
AND YET IT HAS AN EXHILARATING END OF THE WORLD FEEL 
AND YOU CAN SEE FOR MILES 
RIGHT OVER THERE IS A MAJOR TURNING POINT IN OUR JOURNEY AROUND THE U. K. COAST BECAUSE THAT IS JOHN O'GROATS 
WHERE WE TURN A CORNER AND HEAD DOWN THE EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND 
IT'S A JOURNEY FULL OF INDUSTRY AND INGENUITY 
WE'LL STRUGGLE TO LAND FISH EXPLORE THE FUTURE OF NORTH SEA OIL 
MEET BRITAIN'S LAST WHALERS AND DISCOVER WHERE THE MINE DETECTOR WAS INVENTED 
SCOTLAND'S EAST COAST 
A NATURAL PLAYGROUND AND THE HOME OF ENGINEERING MARVELS
