THIS IS CHRISTOPHER DEARDEN FORTY ONE YEARS OF AGE MARRIED ONE SON 
OH JIMMY HELLO IT'S ABOUT DAD ISN'T IT 
YES WE'VE FOUND YOUR FATHER'S BODY 
WHAT TYPE OF CAR DID YOU DRIVE 
THIS IS NOT A NORMAL DUMP SITE THIS WAS CHOSEN 
SOMETHING HORRIBLE'S HAPPENED HERE 
THE TYING UP THE SWAPPING OF THE SHOES WERE ALL INTENDED TO MAKE THE BODY UNSERVICEABLE 
TO THE EVIL SPIRITS THE CHINDI 
JIMMY 
THE BURIAL WAS RITUALISTIC 
I ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT I DON'T ARGUE WITH THAT BUT IF THE MURDER 
WAS RITUALISTIC IT WOULD'VE HAPPENED WITHIN THE CHAMBER 
WHAT'S THE MATTER NO NOTHING 
I RECEIVE MANY CALLS BOTH DAY AND NIGHT ABOUT MANY SUBJECTS 
SIR 
WE CAN GO NOW 
THAT'S NOT MY DAD DID YOUR HUSBAND KNOW ABOUT YOUR AFFAIR 
SOMETIMES PEOPLE FIND IT EASIER TO TALK TO STRANGERS 
HI LUKE IT'S ME 
YOU JUST STAY OUT OF MY FAMILY'S BUSINESS 
YOUR FAMILY 
I LOVE YOU 
SECTION OF SCALP REMOVED ON LEFT HAND SIDE 
BLINDFOLDED 
SHOES ON WRONG FEET 
CANNABIS SPLIFF FINGERTIPS MISSING LEFT AND RIGHT HANDS 
DO YOU HAVE A TIME OF DEATH WELL IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE ENTIRELY ACCURATE 
BUT BODY COOLING PUTS THE TIME OF DEATH SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOUR P. M. AND SEVEN P. M. YESTERDAY 
CAUSE OF DEATH AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS THE TRAUMA TO THE TEMPORAL REGION 
BUT IT TURNS OUT HE SUFFERED FROM A HEART ATTACK 
WHICH COULD'VE BEEN AS A RESULT OF THE TRAUMA TO THE TEMPORAL REGION YEAH NOW THE FINGERTIPS 
BLOOM WAS LEFT HANDED AND IF YOU LOOK YOU'LL SEE THE FINGERTIPS HAVE BEEN REMOVED 
AND IN A MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE BODY 
WAIT ARE YOU TELLING ME HE CHOPPED HIS OWN FINGERTIPS OFF OR HE WAS FORCED TO 
THIS IS INTERESTING ON THE LEFT HAND THE FINGERTIPS HAVE BEEN REMOVED POST MORTEM 
AND THE FINGERTIPS THEMSELVES WERE REMOVED FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRIME 
TOXICOLOGY TESTS SHOW THAT HE HAD INGESTED LARGE AMOUNTS OF BOTH CANNABIS AND COCAINE 
BOTH PARANOIA INDUCING DRUGS BOTH PARANOIA INDUCING COULD LEAD TO ARRHYTHMIA 
SO THAT'S THREE REASONS FOR A HEART ATTACK THE DRUGS BLOW TO THE HEAD FINGERTIPS 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SIMILARITIES THAT SCARF AROUND DEARDEN'S NECK COULD HAVE BEEN A BLINDFOLD 
IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE 
NO ONE KNOWS THE WHY I COLLECTED THESE ROCKS FROM THE WOODLAND SITE 
THESE ARE VOLCANIC ROCKS IT'S A CHALKY AREA SO THEY MUST HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN SPECIFICALLY 
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS TRANSPARENCY OVER HERE 
WHICH IS OF BLOOM'S LEG 
BECAUSE HE HAS THIS SCAR TISSUE HERE WHICH IS A BURN 
I TOOK THE TRANSPARENCY AND I LAID IT OVER THIS ROCK HERE 
GET HIM OUT OF HERE FOR CHRIST'S SAKE 
BLOOM SAME PRESENTATION AS DEARDEN 
POST MORTEM YES BUT BLOOM WASN'T MURDERED HE DIED OF A HEART ATTACK 
BUT WHAT BROUGHT ON THE HEART ATTACK IT COULD'VE BEEN VIOLENCE 
THE LAST TIME WE SAW BLOOM HE WAS HALLUCINATING ABOUT GHOSTS 
HE WAS CRACKING UP IN THE INTERVIEW ROOM HE WAS FULL OF DRUGS AT THE TIME OF DEATH MAYBE HE TOOK THEM 
BECAUSE HE WAS UNDER PRESSURE AND BECAME A LOOSE CANNON MAYBE SOMEONE WENT ROUND AND SHUT HIM UP 
BLOOM MADE A PHONE CALL BEFORE HE DIED TO THE YOUTH CLUB WHERE COLERIDGE WORKS 
O. K. LET'S CHECK OUT WHERE THESE GUYS WERE AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH AND WHO HE MADE THE CALL TO 
RIGHT MR. COLERIDGE YOU ARE A U. S. CITIZEN YOU HOLD A U. S. PASSPORT 
MY FATHER WAS IN THE U. S. MILITARY THE FAMILY MOVED AROUND A LOT AND WHEN DID YOU COME HERE 
WHEN I LEFT THE ARMY 
THE U. S. ARMY 
YES I WANTED TO FOLLOW IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS 
DID YOU SEE ACTIVE SERVICE 
SOMALIA 
I KILLED PEOPLE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING 
BUT I DIDN'T COME TO THE U. K. TO KILL PEOPLE 
WHY DID YOU COME BACK A NEW START 
WAS YOUR FATHER IN THE MILITARY ALL HIS LIFE 
YES SO YOU DIDN'T EXACTLY FOLLOW IN YOUR FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS DID YOU 
WHY DID YOU LEAVE 
I REALISED I HAD CHOSEN THE WRONG PATH 
AND THE RIGHT PATH WAS RUNNING A YOUTH CENTRE IN THE U. K. YEAH 
I DIDN'T WANT A GENERATION TO GROW UP MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES I DID 
WHICH WERE TO PICK UP A GUN TO PROVE YOUR MANHOOD 
WHERE WERE YOU YESTERDAY AT THE CENTRE 
WHY HAROLD BLOOM WAS KILLED YESTERDAY 
I WAS AT THE CENTRE 
A PHONE CALL WAS MADE TO YOUR YOUTH CENTRE AT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN YESTERDAY BY BLOOM D'YOU KNOW WHY HE WAS CALLING 
HE WAS PROBABLY TRYING TO GET HOLD OF ONE OF THE KIDS WHY WOULD HE BE DOING THAT 
HAROLD BLOOM WAS A SMALL TIME DRUG DEALER HE'S A NUISANCE 
FINDLAY HAS WITNESSES TO SAY HE WAS MAKING A SPEECH AT THE TIME OF DEATH 
AND HURST SAID THAT HE WAS AT HIS OFFICE WORKING ON HIS COMPUTER 
EVE GOT A SECOND D. N. A. HIT ON THE SPLIFF SO SOMEBODY WAS THERE O. K. I'LL CHECK THEIR HOMES 
NO CONNECT 
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME 
WELCOME TO THE BODY FARM SWEAT TENT 
AH SO THIS IT YEAH 
NAVAJO STYLE YEAH 
BASED ON DRAWINGS AND THE FACT THAT THE FABRIC TURNED OUT TO BE AUTHENTIC NATIVE AMERICAN WEAVE 
AND THAT THE SAPLINGS HAD BEEN WOVEN TOGETHER TO CREATE A FRAMEWORK 
I INTERPOLATED IT AS THIS OH THAT'S HOT YEAH 
USING HOT ROCKS THAT THEY WOULD FERRY BACK AND FORTH FROM FIRES OUTSIDE 
A SAUNA COULD BE CREATED TO HELP PURGE THE BODY OF ITS TOXINS 
BEFORE THEY WERE RELEASED INTO THE WORLD AS WARRIORS 
AND ALSO TO PURGE THEIR MENTAL TOXINS 
HOW DO YOU PURGE MENTAL TOXINS 
BAD SPIRITS AND THE PURGING OF MENTAL TOXINS IN A SAUNA 
IT'S NOT QUITE A SAUNA I MEAN THERE'S ALL THE RITUAL THE CHANTING 
THE USE OF HALLUCINOGENS PEYOTE THE CROWN OF THE CACTUS VERY CRITICAL 
RIGHT SO THEY PERFORMED THIS CEREMONY BEFOREHAND THEN THE TIME WOULD COME TO GO IN HERE 
ARE YOU GOING IN 
CHRIST IT'S HOT IN HERE 
IT IS BOILING IN HERE SO YOU PURGE 
THE BODY PURIFY THE SOUL GET HIGH AS A FLYING KITE ON THESE SUBSTANCES 
HI EVE I THINK YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THIS 
SPENCE HAS ONE TOO HE'S ON HIS WAY NOW 
ONE OF THESE CAME FROM BLOOM'S AND ONE CAME FROM FINDLAY'S HOUSE 
IT'S STRANGE BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE WRITING ON THIS ONE 
IT'S THE SAME AS ON THE TAXI RECEIPT WHICH IS BLOOM'S 
AS IS THE NAME ON THE ENVELOPE BUT NOT THE SAME HANDWRITING AS THIS ONE 
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT I CAN SEE YOU'RE A WARRIOR NOT A CLOWN 
SO WHO'S HE TALKING ABOUT 
HIMSELF 
YEAH I REMEMBER GOING ON A WEEK LONG RETREAT IN A CONVENT 
AT THE END WE WERE TOLD TO WRITE A LETTER TO GOD AND GIVE IT TO THE MOTHER SUPERIOR 
IS HANNIBAL ALL RIGHT 
YEAH HE'S FIND IT'S JUST FEEDING TIME GO ON STELLA YOU'VE GOT A GOOD POINT 
THE CONVENT SENT US THE LETTER THREE MONTHS LATER 
WHY DID THEY SEND THE LETTER BACK TO YOU TO REAFFIRM OUR FAITH 
SO THEY'RE ON A PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT COURSE 
THEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG DEARDEN GETS KILLED 
YEAH WELL EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL WE UNEARTHED DEARDEN'S BODY RIGHT 
SO MR. TIME TO PAY 
STARTS TO GET WORRIED AND DECIDES HE BETTER RATTLE THEIR CAGES AND KEEP THEM QUIET 
THANK YOU FOR 
COMING HERE TODAY 
WE ARE HERE TO CELEBRATE 
A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES 
I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE AND 
REACH A COMMON UNDERSTANDING 
THAT WILL BE BASED 
BASED ON OUR ON OUR

SHIT 
DO YOU WANT TO BE A WARRIOR OR DO YOU WANT TO BE A CLASS CLOWN ALL YOUR LIFE

TREES AND LEFT US FOR HOURS AND THEN HE PUT US IN HIS SWEAT TENT TO FACE YOUR DEMONS 
FACE THE RAGE FACE THE GUILT

LOOK AT ME IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT O. K. YOU GO HOME 
I'VE DONE A MASS SPEC ON THE PARTICLES CONTAINED 
WITHIN DEARDEN'S ADIPOCERE AND MOST OF IT IS ASH THERE WERE FRAGMENTS OF BONE 
THERE WAS THIS A FRAGMENT OF POLYMER PLASTIC COMPOUND 
AND THAT'S THE MURDER WEAPON I DON'T KNOW AS YET 
HE SUFFERED SEVERE BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO THE HEAD 
CUTS PHONE OFF FROM AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT YES 
AND DID IT KILL HIM I DON'T KNOW I NEED MORE TESTS 
WHEN WILL YOU KNOW AS SOON AS I'VE DONE SOME MORE TESTS YOU NEED TO HELLO BOYD 
ERM LOUISE HURST 
YES I WAS CATCHING UP ON E. MAILS AND MICHAEL WAS IN HIS OFFICE 
JUST CHECKING OVER SOME FINAL PROOFS 
WE WENT HOME ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK 
SO YOU WERE BOTH AT THE FACTORY BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND YESTERDAY YES 
THERE WAS NOBODY THERE WHEN YOU LEFT 
JUST US I LIKE TO WORK LATE 
SO YOU LIVE AND WORK TOGETHER 
YES WE'RE A GOOD TEAM 
WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD UP A PICTURE OF YOUR HUSBAND MRS. HURST 
WHY WELL HE IS A SUSPECT IN A MURDER INVESTIGATION 
AND WE'VE STARTED EXAMINING THE CONTENTS OF HIS OFFICE THIS MORNING 
IT'S A PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO ELIMINATE HIM FROM OUR ENQUIRY 
I SEE 
RIGHT WELL 
HE'S FUNNY KIND 
LOYAL LOVING 
WE HAVE A GOOD AND HAPPY MARRIAGE 
CHILDREN YES 
I HAVE A SON HE LIVES WITH MY FIRST HUSBAND IN LOS ANGELES 
BUT NO CHILDREN WITH MICHAEL NO I MADE IT CLEAR THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANY MORE CHILDREN 
HOW DID MICHAEL FEEL ABOUT THAT 
HE WAS FINE ABOUT IT 
YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT CHILDREN ARE AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE NOT AT ALL 
YOUR HUSBAND IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE HE WAS 
CAUTIONED THREE TIMES FOR KERB CRAWLING 
IN THE SPACE OF TWO MONTHS YES 
MICHAEL WAS UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE 
SOMETHING THAT MICHAEL DOES HABITUALLY NO NO 
AT THAT TIME HIS CARD BUSINESS WAS ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY 
I WAS WORKING LONG HOURS IN THE CITY 
I LEFT MY JOB AND I BOUGHT MICHAEL OUT 
THAT MUST HAVE PUT YOUR MARRIAGE UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE 
YES YES IT DID 
BUT WE TALKED ABOUT IT A LOT AND 
WE WORKED THROUGH IT AND NOW 
I'M TRYING TO RECONCILE THE PICTURE THAT YOU'RE GIVING ME OF THIS LOVING LOYAL HUSBAND 
WITH THE MAN WHO GOT FROM YOUR COMPUTER 
LOGS ON TO PORN SITES OF A PARTICULARLY VIOLENT NATURE 
WERE YOU AWARE THAT HE WAS DOING THAT YES 
I NOTICED RECENTLY THAT MICHAEL WAS DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM ME 
AND SO I ASKED HIM 
IF HE WAS DOING THAT SORT OF THING AGAIN 
AND HE SAID YES 
SO IF THIS IS HIS HABITUAL FORM OF RELEASE UNDER PRESSURE 
WE COULD ASSUME THAT HE'S IN A STRESS SITUATION RIGHT NOW COULD WE NOT 
I SUPPOSE SO 
OH GOD OH GOD YEAH.OH. 
OH GOD OH GOD 
PLEASE PLEASE 
SO HE LIKED THIS SORT OF STUFF DID HE 
IT'S PROBABLY RELATED TO SOME CHILDHOOD TRAUMA 
AH CHILDHOOD TRAUMA THAT'LL GET YOU EH 
IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT 
BUT COLERIDGE'S LITTLE EXPERIMENT IN THE WOODS 
WOULD'VE RECREATED IN HIM SOME KIND OF CHILDHOOD VULNERABILITY 
YEAH WELL 
DO WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT AFTER COLERIDGE'S EXPERIMENT THEY JUST 
CUT THEIR LOSSES HOTWIRED A CAR AND HEADED FOR HOME 
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK SO 
HURST IS REALLY FREAKING OUT IN THERE GOOD 
LUKE 
LUKE 
HELLO HELLO 
HELLO 
HELLO 
IT'S NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO CONNECT YOUR CALL PLEASE TRY LATER 
HI TECH CRIME UNIT I NEED TO TRACE A MOBILE 
DON'T SAY I NEVER GIVE YOU ANYTHING YOU'RE A STAR 
I HAVE HERE COLERIDGE'S PSYCHIATRIC MILITARY RECORD 
NOW HE WAS DISCHARGED IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
HIS PLATOON WERE AMBUSHED IN MOGADISHU ONE FATALITY A PRIVATE NEWBORN AND NEWBORN A NAVAJO 
WAS A NAVAJO 
COLERIDGE WAS DISCHARGED A FEW MONTHS LATER 
SUFFERING FROM POST TRAUMATIC STRESS 
WELL THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE YEAH 
WELL YES EXCEPT HE SAID HE WAS HAUNTED BY THE GHOST OF NEWBORN 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN PSYCHOLOGICALLY 
GHOSTS ARE A WAY OF US GETTING RID OF FEELINGS OF GUILT OR FEAR 
WE PUT THEM ON THE OUTSIDE THEY'RE UNRESOLVED NOT DEALT WITH 
SO HE BLAMES HIMSELF FOR LEADING HIS PLATOON INTO AN AMBUSH 
IT'S DIFFICULT ISN'T IT TO ADMIT YOUR OWN CULPABILITY YEAH 
AND IT'S EQUALLY DIFFICULT TO ADMIT THAT YOU'RE NOT CULPABLE YOU KNOW 
I MEAN IT IS WAR MEN DIE RIGHT MM M. M. 
HE'S LOOKING FOR REDEMPTION COMES OVER HERE 
SETS UP A CENTRE WITH THE KIDS THAT WORKS DOESN'T IT 
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THEN THE MEN 
HE GETS A BUNCH OF LOSERS WANTS TO STIR THEM INTO ACTION 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT YEAH 
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE HIM A KILLER 
NO BUT HE'S A DAMAGED MAN 
HE WILL HAVE DEMONS AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE DEMONS ARE 
WHAT'S THE GOOD NEWS POLYMER PLASTIC COMPOUND 
SAME MODEL AS THAT SMASHED HIS HEAD IN YEAH 
YEAH FROM THE K. SIX PHONE BOX THERE THE PHONE BOX WHERE HE MADE THE CALL TO JIMMY 
RIGHT I WENT BACK TO THE PHONE BOX AND I DUG UP THE CONCRETE PLINTH AND 
I ANALYSED THE BLOODSTAINS THAT I FOUND ON IT AND THEY'RE DEARDEN'S 
SO HE WAS KILLED AFTER HE MADE THE PHONE CALL TO JIMMY 
NONE OF THE OTHERS MENTIONED A CALL WHY WOULD THEY EITHER THEY'RE INVOLVED 
OR THEY'RE WITNESSES EITHER WAY THEY'RE GONNA KEEP QUIET 
O. K. YEAH YEAH MAYBE THEY WEREN'T THERE AT ALL 
WHAT FINDLAY SAID COLERIDGE AND DEARDEN STAYED BEHIND AFTER THE RETREAT 
SO IF THIS HAPPENED AT THE END THEN EVERYONE ELSE WOULD HAVE GONE 
BUT WHY DOES COLERIDGE WANT TO KILL DEARDEN 
AND ARE WE SAYING THE SAME PERSON WHO CAME FOR DEARDEN CAME FOR BLOOM 
IT'S A FAIR ASSUMPTION TO MAKE YES O. K. BECAUSE IF WE ARE I THINK WE CAN RULE OUT COLERIDGE OH GOD 
WHY YES BECAUSE I'VE DISSECTED THE BLOWFLY LARVAE 
THAT I FOUND IN BLOOM'S NOSTRIL AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT 
GIVEN THE STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BASEMENT 
YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN BLOOM WAS KILLED BEFORE SIX P. M. YESTERDAY 
OH 
AND WE'VE GOT COLERIDGE ON C. C. T. V. AT THE CENTRE UNTIL SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
SO ACCORDING TO MY WITNESSES COLERIDGE COULDN'T HAVE KILLED BLOOM 
ARE YOUR WITNESSES TELLING THE TRUTH MAGGOTS NEVER LIE 
YES YEAH 
YES YEAH 
BE QUIET 
YES YES' 
YEAH YEAH 
YEAH 
HELLO HELLO FINDLAY 
YEAH 
MR. FINDLAY 
MR. 
GONE 
WELL HE WAS PRETTY TERRIFIED WHEN HE LEFT HERE 
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET HIM GO 
NO NO I'M NOT I'M SAYING THAT MAYBE WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING HERE 
HE DIED OF A HEART ATTACK WE'VE HAD TWO WITNESSES THEY'VE BOTH DIED OF HEART ATTACKS 
COLLECTIVE PSYCHOSIS 
THEY'RE ALL MAD WELL IN A WAY YES THEY ARE OR AT LEAST THEY ALL SHARE THE SAME DELUSION 
WHICH IS THEY BELIEVE A DEAD MAN'S SPIRIT CAN COME AFTER THEM FROM THE GRAVE 
IT'S ME YOU'RE TALKING TO GRACE COME ON NO I MEAN THAT THEY ARE HAUNTED 
WE BETTER GET HURST OUT BEFORE HE BECOMES HAUNTED AND GOES MAD AND HAS A HEART ATTACK 
HOW DID IT FEEL WHEN COLERIDGE TRIED TO MAKE YOU LOOK BACK AT YOUR CHILDHOOD TRAUMAS 
WOUNDS HE CALLED IT 
WELL I WASN'T GOING FOR IT I MEAN 
HE COULD SEE THAT BECAUSE AS FAR AS YOU WERE CONCERNED 
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY WOUNDS RIGHT 
WHICH IS STRANGE ISN'T IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A LOT OF PROBLEMS 
THAT'S A LOAD OF NONSENSE 
HOW DID HE GET YOU TO EXPLORE THESE WOUNDS 
HE MADE US SIT IN HIS GLORIFIED WIGWAM 
I WANT SOME WATER I DON'T WANT THAT 
YOU FEEL NOTHING FEEL NOTHING 
WE WERE IN THERE FOR HOURS 
AND WHEN WE CAME OUT OF THE TENT 
HE ATTACKED FINDLAY 
HIT ME 
WELL THAT'S WHEN WE DECIDED TO COME HOME 
OH COS YOU'RE FRIGHTENED RIGHT 
GOT A BIT SCARED BIT OF ACTION AND THAT WAS IT FOR YOU GUYS WAS IT 
YEAH SO YOU AND BLOOM FINDLAY DEARDEN 
NO NOT DEARDEN 
COLERIDGE HAD CONVINCED HIM THAT HE 
WAS THIS WARRIOR 
AND HE WAS TIED TO A TREE 
AND HE JUST KEPT SHOUTING JIMMY 
JIMMY JIMMY 
THAT'S THE NAME OF HIS SON 
SOMEONE HE LOVED CARED FOR SOMEONE THAT MATTERED TO HIM 
THAT HE VALUED 
WHAT DID YOU SHOUT WHEN YOU WERE TIED TO THE TREE 
NOTHING 
YOU COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING TO SHOUT 
COS YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE 
COS NOTHING MATTERS TO YOU COS YOU'RE EMPTY 
YOU DON'T HAVE A SON DAUGHTER NO 
YOU AND YOUR WIFE CAME TO SOME SORT OF UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WOULDN'T 
HAVE CHILDREN OR PROBABLY SHE COULDN'T FACE THE THOUGHT 
OF HAVING CHILDREN WITH YOU SO SHE CALLED IT AN UNDERSTANDING 
JIMMY I LOVE YOU SON I LOVE YOU 
SO WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN THERE WAS ALL THIS PRESSURE AND STRESS AROUND 
BECAUSE NORMALLY WHEN YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE YOU TURN TO HOOKERS AND YOU VISIT PORN SITES 
WE WERE THE WARRIORS WE WERE THE WARRIORS 
YOU WERE THE WARRIORS WHAT YOU AND BLOOM 
FINDLAY AND DEARDEN 
DEARDEN WAS A COWARD 
SO WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN HE DID THAT 
WE HUNTED HIM DOWN 
THAT COWARDLY PIECE OF SHIT 
AND HE WAS ON THE PHONE 
I I PULLED THE PHONE OFF HIM 
I PULLED IT OUT 
AND I HIT HIM 
I KILLED HIM 
WHILE HE WAS TALKING TO HIS SON YOU KILLED HIM 
SOMEONE WHO HAD EVERYTHING TO LIVE FOR 
YOU'VE GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LIVE FOR 
WAS COLERIDGE PLEASED WITH YOU FOR THAT 
GET HIM OFF THE ROAD 
NOW WE HAVE TO RELEASE THE CHINDI 
THE SPIRIT HAS TO PASS THROUGH HIM 
SO THAT HIS JOURNEY TO THE WORLD OF THE DEAD IS SAFE 
WE'LL FACE HIM NORTH WE'LL CUT HIS FINGERS 
WE'LL RELEASE THE CHINDI OTHERWISE WE'LL BE FOREVER HAUNTED 
THEN HE SAID 
THAT HE COULDN'T COME BACK 
HE COULDN'T HURT US 
HE COULDN'T EVEN GET THAT RIGHT 
JIMMY JIMMY LOOK AT ME JIMMY
