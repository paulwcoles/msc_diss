ROLE AND NOW I DO 
YOU'RE ALLOWING YOUR OWN 
PERSONALITY TO COME THROUGH 
DROPPING THE STAGEY MANNERISMS IT 
WAS A GREAT PERFORMANCE JODIE I 
ALWAYS THOUGHT OF YOU AS JOLLY

JODIE AND IN THAT NUMBER WHICH IS 
USUALLY CROSS EXAMINED BY ELDERLY 
ACTRESS COAKED BY ELDERLY

EMOTIONAL L. THOUGHT THEY WERE

ASHLEY FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT 
I SAW THE HEART OF NANCY IN THIS 
COMPETITION YOU DELIVERED IT 
TONIGHT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY 
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL AND REAL AND 
HONEST JODIE YOU TURNED DOWN THE 
CABARET YOU GAVE US WEST END 
BROADWAY LEADING LADY PERFORMANCE

EXTREMELY TALENTED L. WORRY A 
LITTLE BIT THAT WE MIGHT GET A 
LITTLE BIT BOARD WITH YOUR VOICE 
AFTER A WHILE IT'S A DREADFUL 
THING TO SAY I KNOW BUT I DO LOOK 
FOR STAR QUALITY IN A VOICE AND 
I'M ON A SEE SAW ABOUT THIS I'M 
NOT SURE JODIE WE CHOSE THAT SONG 
DELIBERATELY FOR YOU TO SEE WHETHER 
OR NOT YOU COULD COME OUT OF THE 
CABARET WORLD AND DO YOU KNOW WHEN 
I SAW THAT V. T. R. AND THOUGHT MY 
GOODNESS IS SHE GOING TO GET IT 
AND THEN YOU DID IT I THOUGHT WOW 
BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY TOOK ONE OF 
THE MOST SELF DEPRICATING IRONIC 
AND SOPHISTICATED SONGS WRITTEN BY 
STEPHEN SONHEIM OR BY ANYBODY AND 
MADE IT YOUR OWN IT WAS WONDERFUL 
REMEMBER YOU AND YOUR VOTES WILL 
ULTIMATELY DECIDE WHO 
BECOMES NANCY

YOUNG FROM IRELAND AND BOTH 
DESPERATE TO BECOME NANCY NIAMH

JUST WONDER IF YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT 
TOO FRAGILE TO BE NANCY

FIRST TIME AWAY FROM HOME IT'S 
HARD WHEN YOU'RE SEEING YOUR MUM 
AND DAD FOR AN HOUR OR TWO AFTER 
THE LIVE SHOW

BACK WALL WITH YOUR TALENT WHEN WHEN ANDREW SAID THAT I WAS LIKE OH 
CRIKEY 
DENISE'S COMMENT ABOUT MY CRIKEY ACTING SKILLS IT BROUGHT ME BACK 
DOWN WITH A BUMP 
I THOUGHT SHE WAS 
ALL OVER THE PLACE AND LOST FOCUS 
SHE WAS DISAPPOINTING 
THE REASON I 
LOST MY FOCUS WAS I THINK BECAUSE 
COCKNEY ISN'T MY NATIVE TONGUE 
SHALL WE SAY 
TO HELP GCSEY SHE 
SEES A DIALECT COACH 
OOH GO'A
