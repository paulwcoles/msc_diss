THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS VERY STRONG LANGUAGE 
HE THINKS HE CAN'T DANCE HE MAY BE RIGHT 
HE CAN'T TANGO OR FOXTROT OR OR BOOGIE 
MY MEMORY IS THAT HE'S THE WORST SINGER IN THE WORLD 
I'M A HARD HEADED WOMAN I'M A BITCH ON HEAT 
HE'S NOT GOOD AT SPORT HE CAN'T PLAY CRICKET 
HE LOVES THE GAME BUT HE CAN'T PLAY IT AT ALL 
HE CAN'T LOSE BOARD GAMES VERY GRACIOUSLY 
I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN DO HAIRDRESSING 
MAYBE HE CAN'T I'D LIKE TO THINK HE COULDN'T 
BUT HE'D TEACH HIMSELF WOULDN'T HE AH 
YES IT IS NICE ISN'T IT 
THERE'S A LITTLE MAN IN THE VILLAGE WHO RUNS UP MY SKIRTS 
AND YOUR NAME IS STEPHEN FRY 
AND YOUR OCCUPATION 
PRINCIPAL BALLERINA WITH THE MARYINSKY STATE OPERA 
STEPHEN COULD HAVE BEEN QUITE A FEW THINGS WHAT'S SO GREAT IS THAT HE'S LOTS OF THINGS POLYMATH RACONTEUR 
WRITER WIT BROADCASTER 
ACTOR DIRECTOR 
PROFESSIONALLY TALL ER SHOT PUTTER 
HE'S ONE OF LIFE'S ENTHUSIASTS HE'S A GREAT POPULARISER BUT WITHOUT LOSING ANY OF HIS OWN INTEGRITY 
HE'S A SURPRISINGLY GOOD KISSER 
HE'S INCREDIBLY VERSATILE NAUSEATINGLY DISGUSTINGLY VERSATILE 
I'VE ALWAYS FELT A JOLLY GOOD EGG 
ME AND HUGH AND STEPHEN WERE ALL CONTEMPORARIES AT CAMBRIDGE 
SO WE ALL ARRIVED AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME 
I KNEW OF STEPHEN'S EXISTENCE 
LONG BEFORE HE KNEW OF MINE I HAD WATCHED HIM IN MANY PLAYS 
HE WAS A SORT OF STRAIGHT ACTOR AT UNIVERSITY 
IT SO HAPPENED THAT I ENDED UP IN A POSITION OF SOME POWER 
I HAD TO PUT THIS SHOW TOGETHER A COMEDY SHOW A REVIEW 
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE SHINY FACED UNDERGRADUATES SINGING SONGS AND BEING LARKY 
I WANTED IT TO BE GROWN UP AND MATURE 
AND STEPHEN HAD THAT IN SPADES IN FACT HE HAD IT IN EVERY SUIT 
AND SO I APPROACHED HIM VIA EMMA THOMPSON AS THE GO BETWEEN 
I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS HAVING BEEN ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WHOLE FRY LAURIE PHENOMENON 
BUT OF COURSE THEY WOULD HAVE MET BECAUSE THEY WERE DESTINED ALWAYS TO BE FRIENDS 
HEAVEN BE PRAISED WE MADE EACH OTHER LAUGH 
NOW THAT'S A LOT OF NONSENSE AND YOU KNOW IT 
HE MADE ME LAUGH SUCH A LOT AND CONTINUES TO DO SO AND HAS MADE ME LAUGH NOW FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
I JUST KNEW THAT HE WAS THE MAN FOR ME AS IT WERE 
AH MR. LAWSON PARTICLE CRIED THE COUNT WELCOME TO CASTLE DRACULA 
TELL ME WHAT BLOOD TYPE ARE YOU 
A. 
I SAID WHAT BLOOD TYPE ARE YOU 
OH I SAID B. 
IF YOU GO BACK AS FAR AS NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AT THE EDINBURGH FESTIVAL 
EVERYONE THERE WAS THINKING 
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THE CAMBRIDGE FOOTLIGHTS AND THAT SORT OF RATHER JOLLY BOATING SENSE OF HUMOUR 
OTHER THINGS WERE GROWING UP SO BY NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE 
THEY DECIDED TO INSTITUTE A THING CALLED THE PERRIER AWARD TO REWARD THE MOST INTERESTING THING IN COMEDY 
AND LO AND BEHOLD IT MUST HAVE ANNOYED THE PERRIER COMMITTEE SUCH A LOT 
THE VERY BEST SHOW OF THAT YEAR HAPPENED TO BE THE CAMBRIDGE FOOTLIGHTS 
WHICH HAD IN IT NOT ONLY STEPHEN FRY IT HAD HUGH LAURIE AND EMMA THOMPSON 
OH ROBERT IF ONLY YOU UNDERSTOOD HOW WEAK I FELT 
I DO FEEL SO DESPERATELY WEAK 
OH BUT MY DARLING YOU MUST BE STRUNG 
YOU KEN BE STRUNG 
BE STRUNG 
BE STRANG FOR ME ELIZIBITH 
KEN YOU BE STRONG FOR ME 
BE STRUNG FOR ME 
I THINK I'VE STILL GOT THE BONNET FROM THE ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING SKETCH GOD WHAT DOES HE KNOW 
OH BUT DEDDY DEDDY DOESN'T MARRY YOU CAN'T MERRY DEDDY 
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MERRY DEDDY YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY ME OH OH 
THERE WAS A LOT OF THAT YES WE DID ENJOY THAT 
THERE IS THIS FOLK MYTH AMONGST THE TERMINALLY RESENTFUL 
THAT STEPHEN AND HUGH AS IT WERE LEFT CAMBRIDGE 
WITH MONOCLES FLASHING IN THEIR EYES AND LOOKED OUT AT THE WORLD SURVEYING IT LIKE 
SATAN ON A MOUNTAIN AND SAID ER RIGHT WHERE SHOULD WE GO 
HUGH OLD CHAP TO ABSOLUTELY ASCEND THE PINNACLES OF COMEDY 
THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS AT ALL THEY'VE GOT WHERE THEY HAVE GOT TO 
BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH EXTREMELY TALENTED 
I THINK THE FIRST TIME I SAW STEPHEN FRY ON T. V. 
WAS PROBABLY THE YOUNG ONES 
THE UNIVERSITY CHALLENGE EPISODE WAS GREAT FUN 
REPRESENTING FOOTLIGHTS WE HAVE LORD MONTY HELLO 
LORD SNOT HE HE HE 
MISS MONEY STERLING AH AND 
I GUESS IT WAS KIND OF MY IDEA THAT MY OTHER FRIEND SHOULD COME IN 
AND BE IN THE YOUNG ONES 
WHO IS THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD 
FOOTLIGHTS SNOT IT'S ME ISN'T IT 
IT WAS JUST A GREAT EPISODE AND STEPHEN HUGH AND EMMA 
BROUGHT THEIR WONDERFUL SAY EMBRYONIC IT WASN'T EMBRYONIC TO THEM BUT TO THE WORLD 
COMIC CHARACTER TALENTS AND OF COURSE IT JUST EXPLODED INTO THE YOUNG ONES MIX 
RELAX WE CAN HANDLE THIS VIVIAN 
ACHTUNG IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC 
MY FAVOURITE COMEDY THING THAT FRY EVER DID WAS SATURDAY NIGHT FRY 
SERIES ONE OF SATURDAY NIGHT FRY ON THE RADIO 
WELL IF THAT HASN'T MOISTENED YOUR LAUGHTER GLANDS 
AND WHIPPED YOU INTO A WHIRLING GIDDY FEVER OF COMIC ANTICIPATION THEN MY NAME'S STEPHEN FRY 
MY MATES AND ME BOOT LEGGED IT OFF RADIO FOUR AND WE'D EXCHANGE CASSETTES WITH EACH OTHER 
I JUST THOUGHT THEY WERE THE FUNNIEST THINGS I'D EVER HEARD 
YOU FIND THE OUTSIDE THE CHURCH OF SAINT BARNABAS THE SMILEY IN THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF SKETTISHAM 
I'M BAYLISS ODDKNOB AND YOU'RE LISTENING TO ON LOCATION 
THIS WEEK WE'RE ON LOCATION FOR THE SHOOTING OF A NEW BRITISH FILM FROM THE DIRECTOR TUMPHREY PUKE 
HE USED TO PLAY A CHARACTER CALLED DONALD TREFUSIS 
WHO'D OCCASIONALLY CROP UP ON LOOSE ENDS AND I ALWAYS LOVED TREFUSIS 
PARENT POWER AND DEMOCRACY ARE AS CLOSELY RELATED 
AS MIKE GATTING AND THE QUEEN MOTHER 
AND UNLESS SOMEONE HAS BEEN KEEPING A VERY JUICY SCANDAL FROM ME 
THAT IS NOT VERY CLOSELY AT ALL 
I LOVED A BIT OF FRY AND LAURIE 
I REALLY LOVED IT I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY VERY FUNNY 
I USED TO BE A REAL BIG FAN OF A BIT OF FRY AND LAURIE I LOVED IT 
IT SORT OF SLIPPED BY ON THE RADAR WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT GREAT COMEDY SHOWS 
A BIT OF FRY AND LAURIE GETS MISSED OUT 
WELCOME TO A BIT OF FRY AND LAURIE 
MESDAMES MESSIEURS BIENVENUE A UN MORCEAU DE FRY ET LAURIE 
THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT IT WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT PEER 
BECAUSE STEPHEN AND HUGH ARE ENTIRELY ORIGINAL 
I JUST THOUGHT THEY LOOKED LIKE A COUPLE OF SCHOOLBOYS 
AND I QUITE LIKE THAT JUST MUCKING ABOUT YOU KNOW 
THERE WOULD BE TWENTY DIFFERENT IDEAS IN EVERY HALF HOUR 
AND GOOD I THINK THAT'S WHAT A SKETCH SHOW SHOULD BE LIKE 
SEE THIS 
YOU COULD EAT YOUR DINNER OFF THIS 
SEX IS NOTHING TO FAX HOME ABOUT 
WELL WE 
OH CHRIST I'VE LEFT THE IRON ON 
THE FACT THAT THE FRIENDSHIP IS REAL IT'S NOT A PROFESSIONAL COUPLING 
THE THING WITH MORECAMBE AND WISE WAS THAT THEY WERE GENUINELY REALLY CLOSE 
AND STEPHEN AND HUGH EXPRESS THAT AS WELL IN THEIR SHOW 
WE HAD NO CONVENTIONAL DOUBLE ACT DYNAMIC BECAUSE WE'RE SORT OF 
THE SHORT FAT FUNNY ONE AND THE TALL LANKY LACONIC ONE 
WE JUST WEREN'T NATURALLY THAT KIND OF A DOUBLE ACT 
NINETY TWO YEARS OLD THAT'S RIGHT NINETY THREE COME NOVEMBER 
NINETY TWO YEARS OLD AND I'VE NEVER HAD ORAL SEX 
WELL I SHOULD THINK NOT INDEED 
ORAL SEX THE IDEA 
NEVER RIDDEN A CAMEL 
YOU'RE JUST BUBBLING NOW MR. SIMNARK 
NEVER WATCHED A WOMAN URINATE 
I SHALL GET VERY CROSS WITH YOU IN A MINUTE I SHALL REALLY 
NEVER KILLED A MAN 
THERE'S A CERTAIN MAN I SHALL BE KILLING IF HE'S NOT VERY CAREFUL 
HE WAS FUNNY IN IT AND HE 
HE LOVES LANGUAGE SO MUCH AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SKETCHES MONOLOGUES THAT HE DID 
I DO HAVE A PECULIARITY WHICH I FEEL I MUST IN ALL SOFTNESS 
BE RATHER HEAVENLY ABOUT JUST FOR A DIVINE 
LIKE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE TODAY I HAVE A PAIR OF NIPPLES ATTACHED TO MY CHEST 
HERE AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THERE 
BUT AND THIS IS WHERE I'M FORCED TO BE A LITTLE MORE DELICIOUS THAN USUAL 
WHILE THIS ONE HERE NEVILLE IS ROSY AND HEALTHY AND EVERYTHING ONE COULD WANT 
THIS ONE SHEILA IS BRIGHT BLUE AND SOMETHING OF A YOUNG DISAPPOINTMENT 
WELL THERE IN A SMOOTH LIMBED GOLDEN THIGHED WAY WE ARE 
THE THINGS THAT MAKE YOU LAUGH WITH STEPHEN FRY ARE THE REWARDING 
AND NOURISHING AND NUTRITIONAL COMEDY THAT HE PRESENTS YOU WITH 
HE HAS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY AN EXTREMELY WONDERFUL WAY WITH WORDS 
AND A VERY SORT OF SUPERIOR WAY 
OF DELIVERING THEM AND I THINK HIS COMEDY LIES IN HIS SKILL WITH HAUTEUR 
MR. DRIP TELLS ME THAT IT'S ONE OF THE MOST MATURE AND EXCITING POEMS 
HE'S EVER RECEIVED FROM A PUPIL DON'T SUCK YOUR THUMB BOY 
WELL I'M NOT SIR 
NO THAT WAS JUST A PIECE OF GENERAL ADVICE FOR THE FUTURE 
THESE 
BERNARD MATTHEWS GOLDEN TURKEY DRUMMERS 
YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW VERSATILE THEY ARE 
I'VE GOT ONE IN AT THE MOMENT ACTUALLY 
THEY DID THIS LETTERS THING AND SAY WE'VE HAD A LETTER FROM 
AND THEY WERE ALWAYS RIDICULOUS NAMES AND I ALWAYS TRY AND COME UP WITH A NEW NAME WHEN I SEE STEPHEN 
THAT I REMEMBER FROM LIKE FELICITY WAISTSPLENDOUR 
GENGOLPHUS PANTYGRACE ALL THESE RIDICULOUS NAMES 
JENNY MOIST NEE JENNY SPLIT 
YOURS PETER COMEINMYEAR 
FIVE ON ITS WAY TO YOU MR. COMEINMYEAR 
IT WAS FANTASTICALLY RUDE 
THE STUFF THEY GOT AWAY WITH I MEAN THEY HAD A CHARACTER CALLED MR. PENTAFUCK OR MR. CUNTABLAST 
AND THEY'D JUST STICK IT INTO A SKETCH AND NOBODY SEEMED TO NOTICE 
I'VE JUST BEEN LOOKING FOR A PARTICULAR BOOK 
IN THE SPORTS SECTION AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THERE 
IT'S BY TED CUNTABLAST AND ER 
I THINK IT'S CALLED THE WEST INDIES A NATION OF CRICKETERS 
THAT'LL BE IN THE SPORTS SECTION 
IT WAS GREAT IT WAS JUST VERY EXCITING 
WATCHING THAT SHOW WAS THE SAME KIND OF EXCITEMENT AS WATCHING THE YOUNG ONES 
YOU KIND OF WENT DID YOU JUST HEAR WHAT THEY SAID 
IT'S SO RUDE BRILLIANT THAT'S THE LOT THEN IS IT YEP 
ALREADY GOT A TRIPLE KNOB JOINT WITH SNATCH MEMBRANE HAVE YOU 
SHOULD I HAVE WELL ARE YOU GOING STRAIGHT OR CURVED 
STRAIGHT THEN CURVED 
SHOULD BE O. K. AS LONG AS YOU REMEMBER TO SUCK THE CLENCHING LOBE TIGHT TO THE BOWL THRUST 
OBVIOUSLY YEAH AND WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T FORGET TO LUBRICATE YOUR SLIP HOLE BEFORE ANY GRIP JIGGING 
THE PETER AND JOHN SKETCHES THE TWO BUSINESSMEN 
WHO BEHAVED AS THOUGH THEY WERE RUNNING A MULTI NATIONAL COMPANY 
BUT IN FACT RAN A VERY SMALL TIME HEALTH CLUB IN UTTOXETER 
KEITH CALLED A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO FROM HELSINKI 
BUT THAT WAS KEITH JUST NOW SURELY 
YEAH JUST NOW OUR TIME BUT HE CALLED A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO HIS TIME 
THEY SPOKE LIKE THAT TO EACH OTHER DAMN DAMN THEY SAID DAMN 
A LOT IT WAS JUST VERY FUNNY AND ONE OF THEM WAS RECENTLY DIVORCED FROM MARJORIE 
DAMN YOU LOOK GOOD MARJORIE 
OH MARJORIE WOULD FLOAT HER OWN GRANDMOTHER 
AS A HOLDING CORPORATION AND STRIP HER BARE OF PREFERENCE STOCK IF SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD HURT ME 
THREE PINTS OF DAMN AND A CHASER OF HELL BLAST 
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE IN A SKETCH WITH SOMEONE THAT YOU LIKE AND ADMIRE IT'S JUST SIMPLY LIKE HAVING 
THE MOST EXPENSIVE SEAT IN THE HOUSE 
THERE ARE THE PEOPLE IN ROW A AND THEY PAID TWELVE OR WHATEVER AND TWELVE 
WHO PAYS TWELVE FOR ANYTHING NOW 
ERM 
BUT THERE AM I A MATTER OF TWO FEET AWAY GETTING TO SEE 
GETTING TO SEE HIM BE FUNNY AND THERE IS NO GREATER PLEASURE THAN THAT 
A FIRST CLASS FLIGHT TO CHICHESTER 
TABLE FOR TWO ON THE SLEEPER FROM CHICHESTER TO STROUD 
HAIR TRIGGER FUR BARREL 
SOFT EARED BULLETS JUST AS YOU LIKE THEM 
YOU CERTAINLY CAME PREPARED DIDN'T YOU I PREFER TO PUT IT THIS WAY 
I CERTAINLY CAME PREPARED DIDN'T I 
WELSH PASSPORT HOTEL RESERVATIONS AT THE WELCOME BREAK LOW WYCOMBE 
ALL IN THE NAME OF ONE LEWIS POTTER 
AND THE REAL LOESS POTTER A CHARTERED PROSTITUTE FROM HEREFORD 
DIED TWO YEARS AGO IN A SMILING ACCIDENT 
HE HAS THIS AGAIN 
REMARKABLE ABILITY TO PORTRAY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS 
ER VERY BELIEVABLY I THINK 
AND ER 
I THINK ONE OF THE BEST ER DEMONSTRATIONS HE GAVE OF THAT 
WAS IN THE BLACKADDER SERIES WHICH I THOUGHT WAS EXTRAORDINARY 
THE THING THAT'S MADE ME LAUGH AND LAUGH WAS WHEN STEPHEN WAS REALLY CRUEL TO HUGH IN BLACKADDER 
AND I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THAT 
THAT RELEASED RELEASED PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT STEPHEN HAD BEEN LONGING TO DO FOR YEARS 
TO HUGH WHICH WAS JUST BELT HIM ONE HOW DARE YOU SIT THERE IN THE PRESENCE OF YOUR BETTERS GET UP 
OH CRUMBS YES I FORGOT I'M SORRY YOU SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO 
UNLESS YOU'D RATHER BE FLAYED ACROSS A GUN CARRIAGE WELL 
I JUST REMEMBER BEING HELPLESS WITH LAUGHTER WATCHING THEM DO IT 
IT WAS JUST SUCH A VERY VERY FUNNY SCENE 
BECAUSE IT'S GOT SOMETHING 
YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME WISH FULFILMENT IN THERE I THINK 
WE NO LONGER TREAT SERVANTS THAT WAY IN LONDON SOCIETY 
WHY I HARDLY TOUCHED THE MAN 
I THINK YOU HIT HIM VERY HARD 
NONSENSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HARD HIT 
I JUST HIT HIM LIKE THAT 
YES I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HITTING WAS SUPPOSED TO EXPRESS 
IT'S NOT REALLY THE GIST OF OUR RELATIONSHIP 
I JUST LIKED FALLING OVER AND HE LIKED MAKING ME FALL OVER AND THAT SEEMED TO BE REASON ENOUGH 
IT'S NOT VERY PROFOUND IS IT 
THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING VERY FUNNY ABOUT STEPHEN BEING CRUEL 
BECAUSE IT IS HIS PURPOSE IN LIFE TO BE KIND AND SO WHEN HE LETS THAT CRUELTY OUT 
THERE'S SOMETHING TERRIFICALLY COMPELLING ABOUT IT AND VERY VERY FUNNY FOR ME IN PARTICULAR 
TAKE MY HAT AT ONCE SIR UNLESS YOU WISH TO FEEL MY BOOT IN YOUR THROAT 
AND BE QUICKER ABOUT IT THAN YOU WERE WITH THE DOOR YES MY LORD I'M A DUKE NOT A LORD 
WHERE WERE YOU TRAINED A DAGO DANCING CLASS 
BLACKADDER WAS JUST GREAT I THINK IT WAS A GREAT SERIES ANYWAY 
FROM THE FIRST TO THE FOURTH BUT PARTICULARLY IN THE FOURTH 
I KIND OF DID LOOK FORWARD TO GENERAL MELCHETT COMING ON 
WHAT'S GOING ON DARLING CAPTAIN BLACKADDER TO SEE YOU SIR 
AH EXCELLENT 
JUST A SHORT BACK AND SIDES TODAY I THINK THEY JUST MADE HIM LOOK LIKE KITCHENER 
THE ABSURDITY OF THE LANDED GENTRY 
SENDING THE WORKING CLASSES INTO WAR TO DIE IN THEIR MILLIONS 
WAS JUST TAKEN UP SO WELL BY BLACKADDER GOES FORTH 
ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO THE BIG PUSH 
NO SIR I'M ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED 
M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. THE HEALTHY HUMOUR OF THE HONEST TOMMY AH HA 
DON'T WORRY MY BOY IF YOU SHOULD FALTER REMEMBER THAT CAPTAIN DARLING AND I ARE BEHIND YOU 
ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILES BEHIND YOU 
HIS PERFORMANCE REALLY FOR ME WAS REALLY THE TRIUMPH OF THE WHOLE SHOW IN A WAY 
BECAUSE OF COURSE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO GET AN OLDER ACTOR 
TO PLAY THAT SORT OF KITCHENER FIGURE 
BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE SAME SOMEHOW 
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A YOUNGER PERSON MOCKING OR SATIRISING THE OFFICER CLASS 
AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE ELSE WHO COULD HAVE DONE IT IN THE WAY STEPHEN PLAYED MELCHETT 
IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING IT WILL CATCH THE WATCHFUL HUN TOTALLY OFF GUARD 
DOING PRECISELY WHAT WE'VE DONE EIGHTEEN TIMES BEFORE 
IS EXACTLY THE LAST THING THEY WILL EXPECT US TO DO THIS TIME 
THERE IS HOWEVER ONE SMALL PROBLEM 
EVERYONE ALWAYS GETS SLAUGHTERED IN THE FIRST TEN SECONDS THAT'S RIGHT 
I THINK THAT STEPHEN'S PERFORMANCE IN BLACKADDER THE FOURTH 
IS THE SORT OF DEFINITIVE FRAMING AND ATTACK ON THE BRITISH ESTABLISHMENT 
I SUPPOSE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE LOVE ABOUT STEPHEN 
THAT HE HAS ALL THE SIGNS OF AN ESTABLISHMENT FIGURE 
PUBLIC SCHOOL CAMBRIDGE SMOOTH RISE TO SUCCESS 
KNOWING ALL THE MOST FAMOUS PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY 
AND YET HE IS ABSOLUTELY AWARE OF ALL THEIR FLAWS 
AND MELCHETT IS THE DEFINITIVE NOT LISTENER AND THAT'S GREAT 
ALSO HE'S TALL ISN'T HE I'M ALWAYS FRIGHTENED OF TALL PEOPLE 
YOU WANT ME TO SIT IN NO MAN'S LAND PAINTING PICTURES OF THE GERMANS 
PRECISELY 
GOOD MAN WELL IT'S A VERY ATTRACTIVE PROPOSITION GENTLEMEN BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT PRACTICAL 
YOU SEE MY MEDIUM IS LIGHT 
IT'LL BE PITCH DARK I WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE A THING 
UH THAT IS A POINT 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL SEND UP A COUPLE OF FLARES YOU'LL BE LIT UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE 
OH EXCELLENT EXCELLENT GLAD I CHECKED 
I THINK THAT STEPHEN IS OFTEN UNDERRATED FOR HIS ACTING 
MISS BOWES DO YOU CARE ABOUT WALKING WHAT ABOUT IT 
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT TAKE SOME NATURE WALKS TOGETHER DISCUSSING ART AND LITERATURE LIKE THIS 
BUT I'D BETTER WARN YOU I'M PRETTY SUSCEPTIBLE 
PERHAPS WE SHOULD POSTPONE THE WALKS UNTIL THE WEATHER IS FINER 
IT'D BE TOO BAD IF YOUR BOOK WAS HELD UP BECAUSE YOU'D CAUGHT A COLD 
I'M TALKING ABOUT SEX MISS BOWES 
YES YOU SEE I BELIEVE IN UTTER FRANKNESS ABOUT SEXUAL THINGS 
HE'S GOT THE STILLNESS OF AN ACTOR AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING 
THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE AS A PERFORMER 
PARTICULARLY IF YOU COME FROM COMEDY YOU'RE EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHTLY WILD EYED AND FLAILING ARMS 
WHICH HE ISN'T 
HELLO DANIEL DAVENPORT CONGRATS ON A TERRIFIC LITTLE INNINGS 
BUT THE UMPIRE'S FINGER'S UP AND YOU'RE OUT HIT WICKET 
WHO IS IT 
JUST SOME FOOLS MESSING AROUND WITH THE ANSWERING MACHINE THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH THOSE THINGS 
PEOPLE CAN'T RESIST BEING CHILDISH 
AS A STRAIGHT DRAMATIC ACTOR IT'S AS IF THERE IS SOME SORT 
GREGARIOUSNESS AND HIS DESIRE TO ENTERTAIN AND MAKE PEOPLE FEEL GOOD 
IT'S AS IF THERE IS SOME SADNESS 
I SUPPOSE I'M AS WELL QUALIFIED AS ANYONE ELSE 
TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S TRUE SO IS IT TRUE 
IS THERE A DEEP SADNESS WELL YES THERE MAY BE 
THAT HAS THE LOT TO DO WITH HIS POWER AND APPEAL AS AN ACTOR HE'S VERY ENGAGING 
I FEEL FOR HIM WHEN I WATCH HIM 
MY EXPERIENCE WITH HIM ON PETER'S FRIENDS 
WHERE HE HAD TO CARRY QUITE A LARGE PART OF THE EMOTIONAL WEIGHT OF THE MOVIE I THOUGHT HE DID BEAUTIFULLY 
WE SHOT IT IN 
I DON'T KNOW TEN DAYS FOR TWO AND SIX 
AND THERE WAS STEPHEN SUDDENLY DOING A MAJOR PART AND HOLDING A FILM 
AND DOING IT WONDERFULLY WELL 
OH AND ER WHAT'S ALL THIS THEN 
IT'S CALLED A POT BELLY ANDREW WE HAVE THOSE IN ENGLAND ALONG WITH CULTURE 
ON THE FIRST DAY OF REHEARSAL FOR PETER'S FRIENDS 
HE WALKED INTO THE ROOM WHERE I WAS ABOUT TO START DIRECTING HIM AND THE OTHERS 
AND I WAS ABOUT TO SAY GOOD MORNING STEPHEN HE SAID BEETHOVEN IS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN 
WHAT BEETHOVEN'S AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN MOZART EVEN MORE SO 
I MEAN TO DESCRIBE THEM AS FIT FOR PURPOSE WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT THEY HAVE A DIRECT HOTLINE TO GOD 
CREATIVELY THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT AND 
STEPHEN STEPHEN WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
WE'RE ABOUT TO START REHEARSING PETER'S FRIENDS OUR CONTEMPORARY FILM COMEDY 
BRAHMS IS ANOTHER ONE ER BACH STEPHEN WHAT IS GOING ON 
THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY WERE WONDERFUL AT IT 
I SAID ARE YOU FEELING SLIGHTLY SELF CONSCIOUS ABOUT REHEARSING THIS DANCE YES THAT'S IT THAT'S IT 
I DON'T WANT TO DANCE I'VE GOT THIS BLOODY AWFUL BODY AND I DON'T WANT TO DO IT 
I'M NOT MOZART AND NOT BEETHOVEN 
WELL THEY WEREN'T DANCERS WERE THEY 
AND HE I MEAN CHRIST FIVE MINUTES OF THE MOST BRILLIANT ARTICULATION OF THE NATURE OF GENIUS 
ON THE WAY TO SAYING I'M QUITE SHY ABOUT DOING THE VERY SILLY DANCE 
WHERE WE ALL HAVE TO WEAR STOCKINGS AND SUSPENDERS 
HAMMERSMITH AND BARON'S COURT KENSINGTON AND BAYSWATER 
PADDINGTON AND CHANGE FOR MAIDA VALE WHOO 
BUT HE COULD EASILY HAVE SAID ER CAN WE DO THIS QUITE SLOWLY AND QUIETLY COS I'M A BIT NERVOUS 
I HASTEN TO ADD THAT ALL FIVE OF THE OTHER ACTORS 
IN THAT DANCE HAD DONE JUST THAT IT'S JUST THAT THEY HADN'T GIVEN THE FOUR PAGE SPEECH THAT STEPHEN HAD 
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TO EXAMINE AIDS 
AND THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING YOUR FRIENDS YOUNG 
I INTEND TO LIVE A LONG TIME THANKS VERY MUCH 
I'M GOING TO OUTLIVE YOU ALL 
LOOK IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO ANYTHING ANYTHING ANYTHING AT ALL 
YES I I'M SO SORRY PETER 
HE KNOWS HE KNOWS YOU'RE SORRY DEAR 
I LOVE YOU I KNOW ANDREW 
JEEVES AND WOOSTER THEY WERE BORN TO PLAY THOSE ROLES 
I WAS SENT BY THE AGENCY SIR 
I WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU REQUIRED A VALET 
IT'S FULL OF THE MOST WONDERFUL WIT AND ORIGINALITY 
GREAT STUFF I'M SO GLAD THEY PUT IT ON BECAUSE I THINK 
AS STEPHEN AND HUGH LAURIE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULDN'T WORK PERHAPS ON TELEVISION 
BUT AMAZINGLY IT DID 
DRINK THIS SIR IT'S A LITTLE PREPARATION OF MY OWN INVENTION 
GENTLEMEN HAVE TOLD ME THEY FIND IT EXTREMELY INVIGORATING AFTER A LATE EVENING 
IF I READ WODEHOUSE STEPHEN FRY IS JEEVES I KNOW PEOPLE WERE NARKED 
GOING STEPHEN FRY IS TOO YOUNG TO BE JEEVES BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS BRILLIANT 
I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS WHAT JEEVES IS LIKE 
HE HEARKENS BACK TO AN EARLIER AGE NOT A VICTORIAN AGE BUT THE INTER WAR YEARS 
HE HAS THE LANGUAGE FOR IT HE HAS THE MENTAL EQUIPMENT HE HAS THE SOCIAL EQUIPMENT FOR IT 
HE CAN FULLY INHABIT THAT WORLD AND BRING IT BACK TO US 
I'M SORTING THROUGH THESE CLOTHES 
THESE ARE FOR REPAIR AND THESE ARE FOR DISCARDING 
WAIT A SECOND 
THIS WHITE MESS JACKET IS BRAND NEW 
I ASSUMED IT HAD GOT INTO YOUR WARDROBE BY MISTAKE SIR 
OR ELSE THAT IT HAD BEEN PLACED THERE BY YOUR ENEMIES 
I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW JEEVES THAT I BOUGHT THIS IN CANNES 
AND WORE IT SIR 
EVERY NIGHT AT THE CASINO 
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN USED TO TRY AND CATCH MY EYE 
PRESUMABLY THEY THOUGHT YOU WERE A WAITER SIR 
THEY CERTAINLY GAVE IT MORE THAN JUST THE SILLINESS 
THEY GAVE IT THREE DIMENSIONS WHICH IS CERTAINLY IN THE WRITING 
AND HIS JEEVES WAS A GREAT CREATION 
HELP ME ON WITH THE JACKET JEEVES 
ERM WHICH WAY UP DOES IT GO SIR 
HIS PERFORMANCE IN WILDE WAS FANTASTIC 
NO ONE AT THAT POINT HAVING SEEN HIM DO THE FRY AND LAURIE SKETCHES 
WOULD'VE THOUGHT HE'D BE ABLE TO KIND OF STEP UP TO THE PLATE IN THAT WAY 
BEFORE WE STARTED DOING THE FILM YOU KNOW I'D NOT REALLY SEEN STEPHEN ACT ACT BEFORE 
IT WAS A BIG LEADING PART IT WAS GOING TO REQUIRE A HUGE AMOUNT OF COMPLEXITY AND ACTING CHOPS REALLY 
I WASN'T SURE IF STEPHEN WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT TO BE HONEST 
AND I WAS JUST BLOWN AWAY BY WHAT HE DID 
I'M NOT TAKING HIM BACK ROBBIE 
NOT AGAIN 
I CAN'T 
I'VE BEEN VERY FOOLISH VERY FOND 
BUT ER NOW I MUST GROW UP MYSELF 
OH PLEASE DON'T DO THAT 
YOU'RE AN ARTIST ARTISTS ARE ALWAYS CHILDREN AT HEART 
IT'S A TREMENDOUS PERFORMANCE AND IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT PART TO PLAY WELL AND TO PLAY SENSITIVELY 
AND HE WAS SO TOUCHING SO GOOD AT IT AND SO LOUCHE AS WELL 
IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING CHANGED IN HIM THROUGH DOING THAT FILM 
CERTAINLY AROUND THAT PERIOD OF TIME AND SOMETHING THAT WAS BEING 
GUARDED MAYBE OR WITHHELD OR WHATEVER IT WAS SEEMED TO BE DROPPED 
I FEEL 
LIKE A CITY THAT'S BEEN UNDER SIEGE FOR TWENTY YEARS 
AND SUDDENLY THE GATES ARE THROWN OPEN 
AND THE CITIZENS COME POURING OUT 
TO BREATHE THE AIR WALK THE FIELDS AND PLUCK THE WILD FLOWERS 
I THINK I UNLEASHED THE INNER 
THE INNER MONSTER THAT IS STEPHEN FRY THE SEXUAL BEING 
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN WHAT IT WAS 
I THINK HE HAS DESCRIBED KINGDOM AS PUTTING ON A COMFORTABLE PAIR 
OF SLIPPERS AND IT KIND OF IS YOU KIND OF KNOW WHERE YOU ARE WITH IT 
I DON'T THINK IT'S PRETENTIOUS I THINK THAT'S PART OF ITS SUCCESS 
ER AND PART OF THAT IS HIS CENTRAL PERFORMANCE 
EVERYONE ELSE I QUALIFIED WITH IS IN THE HIGH COURTS ME 
I MOVE YOUR OLD TOYS ROUND MARKET SHIPBOROUGH 
WELL THAT'S BECAUSE THEY MADE THE MISTAKE OF GETTING GOOD DEGREES FROM WELL REGARDED UNIVERSITIES 
YOUR GENIUS LYLE IS TO AVOID SUCH AN OBVIOUS ROUTE TO LEGAL STARDOM 
NO OTHER CANDIDATE I INTERVIEWED CHOSE HIS UNI 
ON THE BASIS OF THERE BEING A SNOOKER ROOM IN EVERY HALL OF RESIDENCE 
IT'S A FANTASTIC PART FOR HIM IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE CRACKER WAS FOR ROBBIE 
IT JUST MET HIM RIGHT IN THE CENTRE 
AND ACTION 
WHEN BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS CAME ALONG WE ALL THOUGHT 
WELL OF COURSE HE'S GOING TO DIRECT A FILM HE'S GOING TO DO EVERYTHING 
AND I THOUGHT HIS DIRECTING DEBUT I SUPPOSE IT WAS THE FEATURE FILM I THOUGHT WAS DAZZLING 
THE THING I WAS MOST JEALOUS ABOUT ON BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS 
WAS THAT STEPHEN ENJOYED DOING IT SO MUCH I'D MEET HIM AND HE'D SAY GOD ISN'T IT FUN 
THE CASTING IS SO FUN THE TECHNICALITIES ARE SO FUN 
I LOVE LEARNING ABOUT THE CAMERA AND HOW IT ALL WORKS 
AND I THINK THAT'S THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT HIM THE RELISH WITH WHICH STEPHEN GOES AT THINGS 
HE TAUGHT HIMSELF THE TECHNICALITIES OF FILM MAKING SO HE WASN'T GOING 
I'M JUST MAKING A FILM BUT I'LL LET OTHER PEOPLE 
NO HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING AND HE'S IN CONTROL OF IT 
SO LOVELY BAND WE'RE GONNA DO 
WE'D GET TO THE END OF A SCENE AND INSTEAD OF SAYING CUT HE'D GO LOVELY 
OR YOU KNOW HE'D SAY SOMETHING 
POSITIVELY ORGASMIC 
AND SO 
HEARING THAT COMING OUT FROM THIS HUGE THIS HUGE MAN WITH THESE 
THERE WAS A WHOLE SEMI GENERATION OF YOUNG ENGLISH ACTORS AND ACTRESSES 
THAT HE HAS HELPED TO DEVELOP AND BRING TO THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION 
BECAUSE HE WAS BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SPOT THEM 
EVERY DAY THERE WERE THESE ACTORS COMING IN YOU KNOW PETER O'TOOLE 
DAN ACKROYD STOCKARD CHANNING 
ALL THESE GREAT GREAT ACTORS 
AND THEY JUST WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR STEPHEN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE INSPIRES IN PEOPLE 
BUT HE'D BE TERRIBLY NERVOUS ABOUT HAVING TO GIVE THEM ANY KIND OF NOTES 
WHY DON'T YOU COME IN IT'S ABSURD TO WALK TO THE STATION IN THIS 
FIFTEEN MILES FOR GOD'S SAKE ARE YOU MAD 
COME ABOUT THE VACUUM CLEANER HAVE YOU NO 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A WONDERFUL PIECE OF DIRECTION BY STEPHEN FRY I REALLY DID 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A LOVELY FILM AND QUITE A DIFFICULT FILM TO GET RIGHT 
TO CATCH THE TEMPO AND THE PACE AND THE RHYTHM OF THAT PERIOD IN BRITISH HISTORY 
AND DEAL WITH CHARACTERS WHO IT WOULD BE SO EASY TO MAKE THEM SEEM BUFFOONS 
BUT HE ACTUALLY MAKES YOU CARE ABOUT THEM OR THOSE WE'RE MEANT TO CARE ABOUT 
AND I THINK IT WAS A REAL ACHIEVEMENT 
I HOPE HE DOES SOME MORE AND CASTS ME POSSIBLY I'M AVAILABLE 
IRON BOLTS WERE DRAWN BACK 
THE PORTAL SWUNG OPEN AND COUNT DRACULA'S MANSERVANT STOOD BEFORE ME 
OF ALL THE HIDEOUSLY DISFIGURED SPECTACLES I HAVE EVER BEHELD 
THOSE PERCHED ON THE END OF THIS MAN'S NOSE 
REMAIN FOREVER PASTED INTO THE ALBUM OF MY MEMORY 
STEPHEN HAS AN ENORMOUS LOVE OF LANGUAGE 
IN THAT HE AND I SHARE A MISTRESS 
I THINK I SAID EARLIER THAT OUR LANGUAGE ENGLISH 
AS SPOKEN BY US AS WE SPEAK IT CERTAINLY DEFINES IT 
WE ARE DEFINED BY OUR LANGUAGE IF YOU WILL HELLO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LANGUAGE 
AS WILDE SAID ANY MAN WHO WOULD CALL A SPADE A SPADE 
SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO USE ONE IT'S ALL HE'S FIT FOR 
I THINK THAT STEPHEN FRY EXHIBITS THAT QUALITY 
HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY USE LANGUAGE EFFICIENTLY 
IN TERMS OF SUCCINCTLY BUT HE USES IT BEAUTIFULLY AND COLOURFUL 
HE PAINTS WITH LANGUAGE HE FINDS HUMOUR 
THE FACT THAT STEPHEN CAN GO FROM INCREDIBLY ERUDITE PHRASES 
AND REFERENCES TO OPERAS AND GREAT WRITERS 
TO A GREAT PHRASE THAT HE CAME UP WITH ON THE KUMARS 
THE OTHER MAN'S ARSE IS ALWAYS CLEANER AS MY UNCLE USED TO SAY 
IT'S GREAT YOU CAN SAY THAT ENCOMPASSES JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING 
PEOPLE WHO TRY TO AGGRANDISE LANGUAGE INTO SOMETHING THAT'S RIGHT 
IT'S JUST ARSE GRAVY YOU KNOW 
HE'S GOT A FANTASTIC SENSE OF HOW STUPID THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE CAN BE 
OUR LANGUAGE TIGER OUR LANGUAGE 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AVAILABLE WORDS FRILLIONS OF LEGITIMATE NEW IDEAS 
SO THAT I CAN SAY THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE 
AND BE UTTERLY SURE THAT NO ONE HAS SAID IT BEFORE IN HISTORY OF HUMAN COMMUNICATION 
HOLD THE NEWSREADER'S NOSE SQUARELY WAITER 
OR FRIENDLY MILK WILL COUNTERMAND MY TROUSERS 
STEPHEN HAS BEEN COMPARED BY THE PRESS 
AND BY PEOPLE WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS TO OSCAR WILDE 
BUT AT ONE LEVEL I THINK THE COMPARISON CAN BE BORNE OUT 
THAT IS THAT STEPHEN IS NEVER AS BRILLIANT AS WHEN HE IS IN CONVERSATION 
STEPHEN FRY IS MORE OR LESS YOUR PERFECT TALK SHOW GUEST 
QUITE SIMPLY THE CLEVEREST MAN I'VE EVER MET MR. STEPHEN FRY 
HE MAKES MY JOB VERY VERY EASY 
HE LISTS HIS RECREATIONS IN WHO'S WHO AS SMOKING DRINKING SWEARING AND PRESSING WILD FLOWERS 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN STEPHEN FRY 
YOU ALWAYS GET THE SENSE THAT THERE'S A CONVERSATION GOING ON 
IT'S NOT A SET UP FOR HIM TO MAKE JOKES 
OR SOME HUGE POLITICAL POINT IT IS ABSOLUTELY A CONVERSATION 
HE CAN TAKE A BIT OF TEASING AT LEAST I THINK HE CAN 
SO THERE ARE FEW JOKES YOU CAN MAKE AT HIM OR ABOUT HIM 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT TO FORTY YET NO ISN'T THAT A BIT YOUNG TO BE WRITING AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
PROBABLY BUT LAURIE LEE STARTED HIS FIRST BIOGRAPHY WHEN HE WAS ELEVEN 
MARVELLOUS WRITER BUT A GREAT WRITER THAT'S TRUE 
BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO CURL UP AND DIE HE'LL COME AND ZAP STRAIGHT BACK WITH SOME WITTICISM 
THANKS YOU PIG EYED SACK OF SHIT 
HE'S A GOOD TELLER OF STORIES AN ANECDOTIST 
CHURCHILL WAS WOKEN UP ONE SUNDAY MORNING WHEN HE WAS PRIME MINISTER IN FIFTIES AGAIN 
BY A PRIVATE SECRETARY WHO WAS RATHER WORRIED AND SAID I'M AFRAID THERE ARE SOME RATHER BAD NEWS 
CHURCHILL SAID WAR WE'VE LOST SOMALIA WHAT IS IT 
HE SAID NO IT'S ONE OF OUR BACKBENCH M. P.'S ONE OF OUR SQUIRES FROM THE SHIRES 
UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS ARRESTED LAST NIGHT IN SAINT JAMES'S PARK WITH A GUARDSMAN A GUARDEE 
AND SADLY IT'S IN THE NEWS OF THE WORLD AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIT OF A STINK ABOUT IT 
CHURCHILL SAID LAST NIGHT 
YES PRIME MINISTER AND HE SAID IT WAS VERY COLD LAST NIGHT WASN'T IT 
AND THE SECRETARY SAID YES IN FACT I BELIEVE IT WAS THE COLDEST FEBRUARY NIGHT FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS 
AND CHURCHILL SAID MAKES YOU PROUD TO BE BRITISH 
ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD IN ALL THE YEARS I'VE BEEN DOING THIS JOB HE'S LIKE PETER USTINOV 
JONATHAN MILLER HE'S LIKE MUGGERIDGE WAS 
PEOPLE WITH GREAT INTELLIGENCE WHO HAVE A GREAT CAPACITY TO POPULARISE THAT INTELLIGENCE IF YOU LIKE 
A LOT OF ACTORS CAN'T TELL STORIES 
AND EVEN IF ACTORS ARE FUNNY PEOPLE THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY 
IT DOESN'T REALLY HAPPEN 
BUT HE REALLY HAS THAT GIFT YOU WANT TO SIT ROUND A FIRE WITH HIM 
AND JUST LISTEN TO HIM TELLING YOU EVERYTHING HE KNOWS WHICH WOULD TAKE QUITE A LONG TIME I THINK 
I WOULDN'T ALLOW MYSELF TO BE A WEED SO IT WAS CRICKET 
I'D LIE ON THE FIELD WITH A LIMP BOUND COPY OF THE RUBAIYAT OF OMAR KHAYYAM AND SAY 
WAIT A MINUTE GIRLS I'M JUST COMING TO THE LAST VERSE 
I CAN'T POSSIBLY CATCH BALLS AT THE MOMENT 
BUT IT WAS A VERY HARD IF BULLIED I WAS ABLE TO HAVE THE LINE 
DON'T BEAT ME UP I'LL JUST GET AN ERECTION 
I RECOMMEND TO ANYBODY OUT THERE BEING THREATENED BY BULLIES THAT IS A VERY IT'S A VERY GOOD LINE 
I THINK THAT PROBABLY STEPHEN 
AND I MAY BE ENTIRELY WRONG IS REALLY A WRITER 
WHO HAS ADDED IN RATHER LIKE A RENAISSANCE MAN ALL THESE OTHER EXTRAORDINARY ATTRIBUTES 
HE'S ONE OF THE VERY FEW PEOPLE 
WHO'S PRIMARILY A PERFORMER 
WHO IS ALSO A REALLY GIFTED WRITER 
HIS WRITING IN THE NOVELS THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND SCREENPLAYS 
FOR ME THEY'RE SO FULL OF THE REAL MAN 
THIS KIND OF MIXTURE OF COMPASSION WISDOM AND MADNESS 
AND COMIC BRILLIANCE 
I THINK HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS THE BEST THING HE'S EVER WRITTEN 
I THINK IT'S VERY VERY GOOD 
AND ONE OF THE BEST AUTOBIOGRAPHIES I'VE READ 
THE THING THAT STAYED WITH ME MOST FROM THAT IS WHEN HE WRITES ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO JOIN IN 
I SUPPOSE THE REST OF THE SCHOOL WAS PLAYING CRICKET 
AND I HAD MANAGED TO GET MYSELF OFF GAMES BY INDUCING AN ASTHMA ATTACK 
I LOVED THE FEELING OF HAVING THE SCHOOL TO MYSELF 
THE DISTANT SHOUTS AND ECHOES WITHOUT AND THE ABSOLUTE STILLNESS WITHIN 
THE THING THAT STEPHEN FRY WHO'S CAPABLE OF DELIVERING 
THE PERFORMANCES THAT HE HAS AND THE WRITING THAT HE HAS 
STILL HAS ALCOVES OF INSECURITY MAKES ME FEEL LIKE OH WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT THEN 
YOU CAN STILL SUCCEED IN LIFE 
WHILST CARRYING THOSE 
PAPERWEIGHT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE IN THE DARK DAYS 
OF BEING A TEENAGER THERE WAS SOMEONE WHO 
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY DO IT THROUGH MUSIC 
THEY GO I'M NOT ALONE COS I HAVE MORRISSEY OR I HAVE DAVID BOWIE 
I HAD STEPHEN FRY 
AND IT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE 
I'VE READ HIS POETRY THE BOOK ABOUT POETRY WHICH IS SO BRILLIANT AND I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT 
IT'S REALLY TAUGHT ME A LOT 
I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT 
A WOMAN WHO'S VERY KEEN ON CHOCOLATE GAVE ME SOME SPLENDID CHOCOLATE 
AND SAW ME BITING A BIT OFF AND SAID DON'T YOU KNOW HOW TO EAT CHOCOLATE 
I SAID NO AT LEAST I THOUGHT I DID 
SHE SAID NO GET THE TINY BIT THERE PUT IT ON YOUR TONGUE 
TEN MINUTES IT'LL TAKE JUST LET IT MELT 
JUST OCCASIONALLY PUSH IT UP AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH 
AND THIS GREAT RAINBOW A FLAVOURS AND TEXTURES MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH 
THAT'S WHAT POETRY IS IN A SENSE IT SLOWS YOU DOWN RATHER BEAUTIFULLY 
AND YOU JUST ENJOY THE BOUNCE AND HEFT AND GLORY OF ONE WORD FOLLOWING ANOTHER 
I WAS INTERVIEWING HIM ABOUT IT AND I THOUGHT 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I CAN EVEN FEIGN INTEREST IN THIS SUBJECT READ IT AND LOVED IT 
I CAN'T CLAIM TO HAVE WRITTEN POETRY AS A RESULT OF THAT BOOK 
BUT CERTAINLY I APPROACHED IT LESS WARILY AND LESS SUSPICIOUSLY THAN I DID BEFOREHAND 
SO I WOULD THANK STEPHEN FOR THAT 
I THINK THE HIPPOPOTAMUS IS STEPHEN'S BEST NOVEL 
AND STANDS AGAINST ANY OF THE REALLY GOOD NOVELS OF THE LAST TWENTY YEARS 
ANY HUMAN HEARTS LONDON FIELDS BIRDSONG 
I REALLY THINK THAT HIPPOPOTAMUS IS THAT GOOD 
I FEEL THAT HIS WRITING DOESN'T GET PAID THE ATTENTION THAT IT DESERVES 
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT REVIEWING 
IT IS THE MOST CHURLISH RESENT LADEN GENRE 
OF JOURNALISM THAT EXISTS 
AND PEOPLE FEEL HE HAS QUITE ENOUGH SUCCESS ALREADY 
WELCOME TO ARGUE THE TOSS MY TOSSER THIS WEEK IS SIMON KITOURIS 
SIMON YOU SAW THAT SKETCH WHAT DID YOU THINK 
I THOUGHT THE SKETCH WORKED ON TWO LEVELS ONLY TWO 
YES YOU'RE RIGHT I'M BEING SIMPLISTIC 
I THOUGHT IT WORKED ON NINE LEVELS I THOUGHT I SPOTTED TWELVE 
I'M AN INSOMNIAC 
AND THERE WAS A STAGE WHERE THE ONLY THING THAT HELPED ME GET TO SLEEP IT DIDN'T MAKE ME FALL ASLEEP 
BECAUSE IT WAS BORING BUT IT LULLED ME INTO THIS GENTLE WORLD OF IMAGES 
WAS STEPHEN NARRATING THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS 
YOU'LL GET YOUR FIRST SIGHT OF HOGWART'S IN A SEC HAGRID CALLED OVER HIS SHOULDER 
JUST ROUND THIS BEND HERE 
I DIDN'T CHOOSE STEPHEN ALTHOUGH I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN STEPHEN 
I WAS GIVEN I WAS TOLD THAT THREE PEOPLE WERE IN THE RUNNING AND STEPHEN WAS ONE OF THEM 
HE WAS THE THIRD NAME MENTIONED TO ME AND I IMMEDIATELY BLURTED OUT OH LET'S HAVE STEPHEN FRY 
THE COMBINATION OF JO ROWLING'S WORDS AND HIS PERFORMANCE MAKES 
IT'S THE BEST THING THAT HARRY POTTER HAS EVER DONE 
IT'S BETTER THAN READING IT IN YOUR HEAD AND BETTER THAN THE MOVIES 
IT'S A FANTASTIC THING NECK AND NECK THEY HURTLED TOWARDS THE SNITCH 
ALL THE CHASERS SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING 
AS THEY HANG IN MID AIR TO WATCH 
I'M AS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE BOOKS ARE GOING TO END 
BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT STEPHEN'S NARRATION WILL END TOO 
NOW I'M DEPRESSED 
DO YOU THINK THAT NATURALISTS OBSERVING SENSITIVE ECOSYSTEMS ARE SUBJECT TO THE HEISENBERG PRINCIPLE 
THE ACT OF MEASURING ALTERS THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE OBJECT BEING MEASURED 
THAT IS A PROFOUNDLY INTELLIGENT AND INTERESTING QUESTION 
I WOULD SAY HOWEVER THAT IT COMES DOWN NOT SO MUCH TO THE HEISENBERG PRINCIPLE 
OF ALTERING EVENTS BY OBSERVING THEM THAT'S MORE TRUE OF DISCRETE QUANTUM PHENOMENA IN THE COSMOS 
AND I THINK IN THE CASES OF OBSERVING ANIMALS IT'S MORE OR JUST A QUESTION OF SOLIPSISM 
WHICH GOES BACK TO THE IDEA OF BISHOP BERKELEY AND IF A COW IS ALONE IN A FIELD 
DOES IT EXIST IF THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO PERCEIVE IT 
ESSE EST PERCIPE IF YOU REMEMBER IS THE PHRASE I LOVE YOU 
I CAN NEVER GET OVER THE RANGE OF HIS KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING 
WHENEVER TALKING TO HIM IT'S FASCINATING BECAUSE HE KNOWS ABOUT EVERYTHING 
IF YOU'VE NOT GOT A LAPTOP WITH YOU HE'S GOOGLE 
MORE REMARKABLE THAN HIS INTELLIGENCE IS HIS PRODIGIOUS MEMORY 
STEPHEN HAS NEVER FORGOTTEN ANYTHING THAT HE'S EVER READ SEEN HEARD OR DONE 
AND THAT'S SLIGHTLY CREEPY 
SOMETIMES I THINK OF HIM AS THE MOST WONDERFUL MR. TOAD 
EVERY DAY THERE'S SOMETHING NEW 
POOP POOP YOU FEEL LIKE HE'D BE RUNNING AROUND SOME PART OF LONDON 
BECAUSE HE'S DISCOVERED SOME NEW PIECE OF SCIENCE OR HAS READ SOME NEW OBSCURE FRENCH POET OR SOMETHING 
AND HE'S MADE SOME APPLICATION WITH THE LIFE THAT WE'RE ALL LEADING 
HE LIKES TO PASS ON ENTHUSIASMS 
IT'S EXCITING TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE EXPERIENCE ENTHUSIASM PASSIONS 
AND I LOVE THAT ABOUT HIM DO YOU KNOW EVERYTHING 
I REALLY DON'T KNOW SIR 
H. M. M. 
HE'S PROBABLY THE ONLY PERSON 
WHO CAN GET AWAY WITH BEING AN INTELLECTUAL AND BEING ADORED BY THE BRITISH PUBLIC 
AS ENGLISH PEOPLE WE'RE SUSPICIOUS OF INTELLIGENCE 
WE DON'T LIKE INTELLIGENT PEOPLE 
YOU SNOB YOU POMPOUS GIT YOU SWOT YOU BOFFIN 
BUT STEPHEN FRY YOU FEEL A WARMTH FOR HIM BECAUSE I DON'T THINK HE'S 
I'VE NEVER WITNESSED HIM USE HIS INTELLIGENCE CRUELLY 
I THINK HE IS SOMEONE WHO KIND OF AGAINST THE ODDS SAID 
I KNOW A LOT MORE THAN YOU EVER WILL KNOW BUT I'M NOT JUDGING YOU FOR NOT KNOWING IT 
I'LL SHARE WITH THE IF YOU WANT IF YOU DON'T THAT'S FINE 
COS I'M DOING SILLY SHOW WHICH YOU CAN ENJOY ANYWAY BUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HERE 
NOW THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS LIKE LONDON 
EVERY TIME WE SPEAK IT'S A MONGREL MOUTHFUL WHETHER WE KNOW IT OR NOT 
OF CHAUCER AND MILTON AND DRYDEN AND POPE AND SHAKESPEARE AND DICKENS 
AND AMERICAN SOUTH CENTRAL AND GHETTO RAP 
AND CHICAGO AND AUSTRALIAN CONVICT TALK AND LEGAL AND NAVAL AND MILITARY 
EVERY PHRASE WE UTTER IS THE EQUIVALENT OF LONDON 
IT'S BOTH VULGAR AND PROCESSIONAL IT'S BOTH GRAND AND SQUALID 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HUMANS BEINGS ARE IT SEEMS TO ME 
BOTH ANIMAL AND NOBLE 
HE ENGAGES PEOPLE WITH THEIR OWN INTELLIGENCE AND THAT'S WHAT CRUCIAL ABOUT HIM 
THAT'S THE REAL HALLMARK OF A GREAT COMMUNICATOR 
HE AWAKENS PEOPLE'S OWN INTELLIGENCE 
WHEN I'VE SPENT TIME WITH HIM 
I DON'T THINK I WISH I HAD BEEN IN A FILM WITH HIM 
I THINK I WISH I'D GONE TO UNIVERSITY AND WAS A BIT BRIGHTER 
IF THERE'S ANYONE OUT THERE WHO MAKE YOU THINK 
I SHOULD READ A BOOK I SHOULD LISTEN TO SHOSTAKOVICH 
I SHOULD BE BETTER 
I THINK IT'S A JOY THAT SOMEONE AS ACADEMIC AS STEPHEN 
GETS ON THE TELLY 
AND IS ALLOWED TO STAY LONG SENTENCES THAT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS BECAUSE WE NEED A BIT MORE OF THAT 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO Q. I. 
THE WORLD'S MOST IMPOSSIBLE QUIZ AND THE NEAREST MODERN EQUIVALENT 
TO LIONS VERSUS CHRISTIANS LET'S MEET MY LUNCH 
MOST HOSTS IF YOU GAVE Q. I. TO ANYONE ELSE YOU'D KNOW THEY WERE JUST READING OFF THE CARDS 
WHEREAS STEPHEN QUITE OFTEN DROPS THE CARDS AND JUST KNOWS STUFF 
WHAT THE STUNNING MOMENTS ARE WHEN YOU KNOW HE'S NOT READING 
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S STUFF FALLING OUT OF HIS HEAD IT'S UNBELIEVABLE THE THINGS HE KNOWS 
THEY ARE EASILY DISTRACTED AND 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY LOOK AT THAT 
NO ALAN THIS IS A COMMON MISTAKE 
ONLY HUMANS FOLLOW THE LINE OF A FINGER 
ANIMALS LOOK AT THE FINGER IF YOU POINT AT SOMETHING 
THE DOG WON'T GO WHAT'S HE LOOKING AT THEY LOOK AT YOUR FINGER 
IT'S NICE TO FIND A SHOW WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE A WARMTH UNDERNEATH IT 
AND A GENUINE FEELING OF FUN YOU DO GET THE FEELING THAT EVERYONE IS ENJOYING IT 
BOTH STEPHEN AND I FEEL FIERCELY ABOUT THIS 
THAT NOT ONLY IS IT A HAVEN OF A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHTLY WORN INTELLIGENCE BUT ALSO OF NICENESS 
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF PEOPLE BEING HORRIBLE TO EACH OTHER BEING FIRED FROM BIG BROTHER FOR RACIST REMARKS 
OR PUTTING TWO PEOPLE IN A DOCUMENTARY WHO HATE EACH OTHER AND SEEING WHAT HAPPENS 
ON Q. I. YOU JUST GET PLEASANTNESS REALLY 
WHICH IS THE TELEVISION AND RADIO THAT I AND STEPHEN GREW UP WITH 
WHAT QUITE INTERESTING MATERIAL DO THEY MAKE THEIR HOUSES FROM 
BOLLYWOOD SONG 
IS IT DINOSAUR EGGS 
I'M ALMOST INCLINED TO TEAR UP THE REAL ANSWER AND SAY YES BUT 
BECAUSE I'VE GOT ONE 
A CHINESE DINOSAUR EGG 
YES IT WAS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FROM MY WIFE 
EVERY EVENING BILL FOUR HOURS ON THE EGG JUST IN CASE 
IN Q. I. HE IS DOING THE SAME KIND OF HEADMASTER CHARACTER 
THAT HE PLAYED IN FRY AND LAURIE SKETCHES FOR YEARS 
IT'S THE SAME KIND OF NOW BOYS HE'S CLEVERER THAN THE REST OF THE BOYS BUT HE'S ALSO FASCINATED 
BY WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION 
AND HE'S JUST A KIND OF WITTY GENTLE PRESENCE WHO'S BASICALLY IN CHARGE 
THE RULES ARE SIMPLE AS I DON'T REALLY EXPECT ANYONE TO GET ANY OF THE ANSWERS RIGHT I AWARD POINTS 
FOR BEING INTERESTING AND PENALTIES USUALLY IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE 
TO ALAN FOR BEING OBVIOUS 
HE'S GOT ALAN DAVIES LIKE THIS STUPID BOY YOU SHOWS PROMISE AND SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED 
AND YOU NEVER KNOW HOW HE MIGHT TURN OUT 
SOME PEOPLE SAY IT'S THE MOST HOMOEROTIC DOUBLE ACT ON TELEVISION 
AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE 
WE'RE ALL GOING TO LIVE ON MARS IN THE END 
ARE WE 
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT 
YES THAT NINETEEN FIFTIES BOYS' ADVENTURE BOOK ISN'T NECESSARILY THE TRUTH 
I DIDN'T GET IT FROM THERE I GOT FROM CHANNEL FIVE 
OPEN YOUR DESK 
YOU CAN GET CHANNEL FIVE THAT IS YOU 
THAT'S AN ALAN POTATO HEAD 
I SEE A SIDE OF STEPHEN I DON'T NORMALLY SEE WHICH IS A KIND OF MORE LADDISH SIDE 
HE DID INVENT THE BALL COCK THE BALL COCK 
SORRY I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT'S FUNNY IT JUST IS 
IT'S QUITE FORTUNATE IN A WAY THAT HE'S VERY CLEVER AND VERY FUNNY 
AND LACKING IN CONFIDENCE BECAUSE IT MAKES HIM VERY UNPRETENTIOUS AND VERY ACCESSIBLE 
IT'S A SHAME HE LACKS CONFIDENCE 
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN HIM ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS IN HIS LIFE 
BUT FOR THOSE OF US AROUND HIM IT'S A BOON 
I THINK HE'S MADE CLEAR ALSO IN HIS WRITINGS THAT BEING A VERY INTELLIGENT PERSON 
DOESN'T AT ALL ABSOLVE YOU FROM LIFE'S PROBLEMS AND DOESN'T MEAN 
NECESSARILY THAT YOU CAN COPE WITH EVERYTHING LIFE THROWS AT YOU 
AND IT MAY EVEN BE A COMPLICATING FACTOR 
STEPHEN'S EMOTIONS AND HOW HE ACCESSES THOSE AND EXPRESSES THOSE IS QUITE ANOTHER MATTER 
I THINK THAT THAT HUGE INTELLECT IS OFTEN VERY MUCH IN THE WAY 
I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT HIM I KEEP SAYING YOU'RE DOING TOO MUCH 
I THINK WHAT HE DREADS MOST IS BOREDOM HE DREADS MOST INACTIVITY 
HE'S ALWAYS HUNGRY FOR THE NEXT SET OF PROBLEMS TO SOLVE 
IN YOU HAVE A BRAIN THAT NEEDS TO KEEP GOING ON LIKE A MACHINE 
IT DOES NEED TO HAVE THINGS THROWN AT IT 
IT'S LIKE SOME SORT OF FURNACE AND BETTER THAT IT'S GIVEN OTHER THINGS TO BURN THAN ITS OWN SELF 
IS THIS A FRANTIC CHASE TO DO AS MANY THINGS AS HE POSSIBLY CAN BEFORE BEFORE I DIE 
CROSS TO THE FURTHER SHORE 
BEFORE I DIE OF DEATH YES IT IS 
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST IT ABSOLUTELY IS SOME PEOPLE ARE UNAWARE OF DEATH 
I'M CONSTANTLY AWARE OF DEATH OR AT LEAST CONSTANTLY AWARE OF A MOMENT JUST BEFORE DEATH 
WHEN I SAY TO MYSELF WELL BUGGER WHY DIDN'T I DO THAT WHY DO I SAY NO TO WHAT EVER IT IS 
ONE OF THE INTERESTING EPISODES IN STEPHEN'S LIFE 
WHICH IS NOW WELL DOCUMENTED BY HIMSELF AS WELL 
WAS WHEN HE WALKED OUT OF THE PLAY IN THE WEST END THAT HE WAS DOING 
HIS DISAPPEARANCE FOR A FEW DAYS 
THE ACTOR STEPHEN FRY WHO DISAPPEARED ON SUNDAY HAS SENT A FAX TO HIS AGENT 
SAYING HE LEFT THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF STAGE FRIGHT 
IT WAS INTERESTING THAT THE PRIMARY EMOTION FROM PEOPLE WAS CONCERN 
RATHER THAN IT BEING A TABLOID TITBIT TO PULL APART 
THIS WAS A REAL PERSON THAT PEOPLE HAD A LOT OF AFFECTION FOR 
WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY GOING THROUGH SOMETHING VERY DIFFICULT 
PEOPLE WERE INCREDIBLY CONCERNED AND THAT'S THE MARK OF THE MAN 
FROM THAT POINT ON IT SEEMED THAT HE ACTUALLY TOOK CONTROL OF HIS LIFE 
MORE CONTROL THAN HE HAD BEFORE 
AND THEN AGAIN HE BEGAN TO MAKE A VIRTUE OUT OF THE THINGS THAT HAD TROUBLED HIM 
AND I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A VERY SIGNIFICANT MOMENT IN HIS LIFE 
IN RECENT YEARS HE DID WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE 
AND THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMME 
WHICH KIND OF SUGGESTS THAT THESE ARE NOT THINGS THAT ARE NOW SHAMEFUL FOR HIM 
THESE ARE THINGS THAT HE'S PROFFERED UP FOR DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ABOUT HIM 
THIS WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ABOUT HIM 
PARTICULARLY HIS JEWISH HERITAGE AND THE PEOPLE LOST IN THE HOLOCAUST 
THIS IS ALL JEWISH PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE 
THERE'S THE NAMES OF MY GREAT GRANDPARENTS 
SO EVERYONE WHO LIVED IN THIS HOUSE WAS TAKEN 
BEATE UND SAMUEL I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A PLAQUE TO THEM 
THERE'S AN INFLEXIBLE HONESTY AND OPENNESS ABOUT STEPHEN 
WHICH I SUPPOSE HE'S LEARNED TO SHOW 
PERHAPS IN THIS MIDDLE PART OF HIS LIFE 
WE ALL KNEW THEY'D DIED AND 
AT LEAST BELIEVED IT 
BUT SEEING THEIR NAMES THERE 
AND THAT FUCKING WORD AUSCHWITZ IT JUST 
IT DOES SOMETHING TO YOU I TELL YOU IT'S 
QUITE TERRIBLE 
HE'S SO INCREDIBLY COURAGEOUS AT DESCRIBING 
THE DIFFICULTIES HE'S HAD HIMSELF 
IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT PROGRAMME HE DID I REMEMBER WATCHING IT ON TELEVISION 
IT MUST HAVE HELPED SO MANY PEOPLE 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE GREAT BITS OF TELEVISION 
WHERE YOU KNOW AS YOU WATCH IT THAT THE WORLD IS GOING TO BE CHANGED 
BY THE FACT THAT IT'S BEING DONE 
AND I THINK STEPHEN ALREADY SAYS THAT DOCTORS ARE SAYING 
THAT THEY'RE GETTING THOUSANDS MORE PEOPLE WHO SUDDENLY UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE FEELING LIKE THEY ARE 
AND THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN DEPRESSED LIKE THAT WHAT'S YOUR SELF ESTEEM LIKE 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY ZERO 
TO STAND UP AND WALK TO THE FRIDGE IS AN ACT OF UNBELIEVABLE EFFORT 
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IS BECAUSE YOU ARE 
A CUNT IT'S BECAUSE I'M A COMPLETE WANKER 
BECAUSE I'M AN ARSEHOLE YOU ALMOST HAVE A TOURETTE'S VIEW OF YOURSELF 
YOU THINK OF DEATH ALL THE TIME EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT FEELING SUICIDAL 
YOU ARE CONSTANTLY AWARE OF DEATH AND AWARE OF YOUR OWN DEATH AND HOW WELCOME IT WOULD BE 
THIS ISN'T SELF REVELATION FOR THE SAKE OF SELF REVELATION THIS ISN'T BIG BROTHER 
WHAT HE WAS DOING WHEN HE MADE THE PROGRAMME ABOUT MANIC DEPRESSION 
WAS REALLY OPENING A DOOR ON TO SOMETHING THAT FOR A LONG TIME HAS HAD A HUGE STIGMA 
PERSONALLY I HAVE NO PROBLEM AT ALL SAYING THAT I'VE BEEN DEPRESSED 
AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M ASHAMED OF 
BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO FEEL A SENSE OF SHAME ABOUT IT 
AND IT'S ALSO DEEPLY MISUNDERSTOOD 
SEEING STEPHEN ACTUALLY IN THE PROGRAMME 
THERE WAS A SECTION OF IT 
WHERE HE WAS OBVIOUSLY SUFFERING FROM THE FEELINGS THERE AND THEN AS HE SPOKE 
VERY SORT OF BLACK STATE AT THE MOMENT 
AND WOULD LOVE TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE OTHER THAN HERE FRANKLY 
USUALLY WHEN I FEEL LIKE THIS I HIDE AWAY I CAN'T THIS TIME 
FOR ME THAT NUMBING KIND OF DEPRESSION COMES THREE TO FOUR TIMES A YEAR 
AND LAST A WEEK TO TEN DAYS' 
IT'S FANTASTIC TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE 
AND THAT NOT ONLY ARE YOU NOT ALONE BUT SOMEONE 
THAT KIND OF SUCCESSFUL AND ERUDITE AND APPARENTLY EVEN KEELED 
I REMEMBER MY MUM AND DAD 
OR PEOPLE I KNOW WHO WATCHED THAT DOCUMENTARY OR HAPPENED TO CATCH IT 
WHO NORMALLY WOULDN'T WATCH DOCUMENTARIES OR WERE DRAWN TO IT BECAUSE IT WAS STEPHEN 
AND PEOPLE BEING MOVED AND TOUCHED BY IT AND ILLUMINATED BY IT 
IT WAS THE PERFECT DOCUMENTARY IN THAT IT OPENED HIM OUT 
IN COMPLETE OPENNESS AND CONFIDENCE 
AND SELF CONFIDENCE THAT HE COULD BE TRUE ABOUT HIMSELF 
IT ALSO HAD THAT STEPHEN THING ABOUT BEING VERY INTERESTED IN OTHER PEOPLE 
HE ACTUALLY WAS KEEN TO FIND OUT AND ENQUIRE FROM OTHER PEOPLE 
WHAT THEIR PROBLEMS WERE AND HOW THEY ALSO HAD SHARED IN IT ALL 
I THINK IT WAS A RICH BREW 
IT'S DIFFICULT BEING A MUMMY SOMETIMES BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT 
AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD BE NORMAL AND BE SENSIBLE 
AND RESPONSIBLE AND 
SLEEP EIGHT HOURS A DAY YOU CAN BE SENSIBLE 
AND YOU ARE NORMAL 
ALL PERSONALITIES OF BALANCED OUT BY SOMETHING 
MUM'S JUST HAPPENS TO BE THAT HER CREATIVITY IS BALANCED OUT BY HER GOING TO SLEEP 
DOES IT TOUCH TO LET YOU THINK THEY THINK YOU'VE GOT A GIFT 
I CAN'T DESCRIBE WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE I JUST 
IT'S REALLY TOUCHING IT IS ISN'T IT 
I THINK WE'VE YET TO SEE STEPHEN'S MASTERWORK 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS 
IT MIGHT BE AN OPERA OR A BRILLIANT FILM PERFORMANCE IT MAY BE A NOVEL 
I JUST HAVE NO IDEA BUT I THINK THAT'S STILL IN HIM 
I THINK THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR GREAT THINGS IN THE DOCUMENTARY FIELD 
THAT HE COULD STILL DO 
MORE WRITING PLEASE AND MORE OF EVERYTHING ELSE 
IT WOULD BE NICE TO FEEL THAT HE'D BE ALLOWED TO BE VERY FUNNY SOMETIME AS WELL 
SO THE NEW GENERATION CAN ENJOY AN OLD MAN BEHAVING LIKE AN ARSE 
HE'S GOING TO DO EVERYTHING HE'LL END UP RUNNING THE UN WON'T HE 
COME ON EVERYONE GOD KNOWS ONE WISHES HE WOULD 
QUITE FRANKLY I THINK HE SHOULD BE PRIME MINISTER 
WHO KNOWS MALE PROSTITUTION IS ALWAYS AN OPTION AS WELL WITH STEPHEN 
IT'S SOMETHING HE'S TALKED ABOUT A LOT 
I'VE TRIED TO KEEP HIM AWAY FROM THAT BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED 
IF HE WENT DOWN THE GIGOLO ROUTE AS WELL 
TO BE GORGEOUS AND HIGH AND TRUE AND FINE AND FLUFFY AND MOIST AND STICKY AND LOVELY 
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BELIEVE THAT ONE IS GORGEOUS AND HIGH AND TRUE 
FINE AND FLUFFY AND MOIST AND STICKY AND LOVELY 
I BELIEVED IT IN MYSELF TREMULOUSLY AT FIRST 
THEN WITH MOUNTING HEAT AND PASSION BECAUSE STOPPING OFF FOR A SECOND 
TO BE SUPER AGAIN I'M SO OFTEN TOLD IT THAT'S THE SECRET REALLY 
I THINK THIS COUNTRY IS INCREDIBLY LUCKY TO HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE STEPHEN 
AND FORTUNATELY WE STILL PRODUCE MARVELLOUS PEOPLE LIKE THAT 
HUGELY TALENTED AND A GREAT HUMAN BEING I THINK 
THE MAN IS A NATIONAL TREASURE 
HE'S A NATIONAL TREASURE AND HE'S A PERSONAL TREASURE TOO 
I SHARE HIM WITH THE NATION 
LANGUAGE IS A CREAK ON THE STAIR 
IT'S A SPLUTTERING MATCH HELD TO A FROSTED PANE A HALF REMEMBERED CHILDHOOD BIRTHDAY PARTY 
IT'S THE WARM WET TRUSTING TOUCH OF A LEAKING NAPPY THE HULK OF A CHARRED PANZER 
THE UNDERSIDE OF A GRANITE BOULDER THE FIRST DOWNY GROWTH ON THE UPPER LIP OF A MEDITERRANEAN GIRL 
IT'S COBWEBS LONG SINCE OVER RUN BY AN OLD WELLINGTON BOOT 
NI'NIGHT
