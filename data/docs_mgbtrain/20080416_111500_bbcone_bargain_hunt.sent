NINETEEN SIXTY SIX WORLD CUP LAST TIME THEY WON ANYTHING SHALL WE LOOK AT IT YES 
LOOK WHERE IT'S POSTED AS WELL WEMBLEY HI CHARLES THERE ARE SO MANY AUTOGRAPHS 
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FIRST THIS ONE CAUGHT OUR EYE 
WE LIKE THIS AUTOGRAPHS ARE A VERY DISTINCTIVE FIELD OF COLLECTING 
YOU MUST BE CAREFUL THAT WHAT YOU'RE BUYING IS ORIGINAL 
I KNOW THIS STAND FROM THE GENTLEMAN I SPOKE TO EARLIER AND HE OFFERS THAT GUARANTEE 
WE'VE GOT THE NINETEEN SIXTY SIX WORLD CUP BOBBY MOORE 
WE'VE GOT THE FIRST DAY COVER WITH THE POSTMARK AND STAMP FOR THE DAY OF THE EVENT IT'S WEMBLEY YES 
WHICH IS NOW OBVIOUSLY EXTINCT 
AND IT'S ALSO SIGNED BY ROGER HUNT AND RAY WILSON WHO PLAYED FOR ENGLAND THAT DAY 
MY FATHER COVERED THE NINETEEN SIXTY SIX WORLD CUP I'VE STILL GOT HIS PRESS PASS 
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH I WASN'T HERE THEN BUT HE GAVE ME HIS PRESS PASS 
IT'S IN NICE CONDITION NICELY MOUNTED IT WILL APPEAL TO A TRADE BUYER AND A PRIVATE COLLECTOR 
MIGHT YOUR FATHER HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN IT VERY POSSIBLY 
MY DAD WOULD HAVE BEEN CHUFFED IF THIS WAS THE FIRST THING I BOUGHT 
GOOD WHAT'S IT WORTH 
I THINK WE COULD HAGGLE ON THAT 
WE COULD WHAT WOULD YOU PAY FOR IT 
THIRTY FORTY I'D PAY FORTY FOR IT QUITE COMFORTABLY 
IF THIS CAME TO AN AUCTION TODAY ANY AUCTION ROOM ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
WOULD SUGGEST A FIGURE OF BETWEEN LET'S SAY THIRTY AND FIFTY 
IF WE COULD HAGGLE HARD O. K. YOU DO THE HAGGLING 
GO FOR ABOUT FORTY BRILLIANT 
THE GIRLS GOT IT FOR TWO SCORE 
SOMETIMES IN LIFE YOU HAVE TO PUT A BRAVE FACE ON IT AND TAKE A PUNT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT FACE DO YOU LIKE THE LOOK OF HER 
SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE COMES FROM SIAM OR BALI WEARING HER EXOTIC JEWELS AND RIBBONED HEAD DRESS 
I RATHER HOPE THAT IT'S CLOSER TO EUROPE MAYBE ITALY OR GERMANY 
THERE ARE TWO CERAMIC MANUFACTURERS GOLDSCHEIDER AND LENCI 
WHO SPECIALISED IN WALL MASKS OF T. H. I. S. TY PE 
IT'S GOT A BIT OF STRING SO THAT YOU COULD HANG IT UP ON THE WALL 
THEY MADE ALL SORTS OF EXOTIC MASKS IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND NINETEEN THIRTIES 
I'M RATHER HOPING THIS IS SIMPLY AN UNMARKED GERMAN OR ITALIAN EXAMPLE 
HOW WILL I FIND OUT ABOUT THAT 
I'LL HAVE TO AS THEY SAY PHONE A FRIEND ACTUALLY 
I'LL SHOW IT TO SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS ABOUT GOLDSCHEIDER AND LENCI MASKS 
SHE'S COST TEN WHICH IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY 
AND I THINK SHE'S PRETTY PRETTY 
WHAT'S IT WORTH IF IT IS ATTRIBUTED TO LENCI OR GOLDSCHEIDER 
WELL AS AN UNMARKED EXAMPLE PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED 
SEE I'M FEELING BETTER ALREADY AREN'T I DARLING 
I'VE JUST PICKED THESE UP I'VE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THEY ARE 
I LOVE THINGS THAT REMIND YOU OF CHILDHOOD I CAN REMEMBER REALLY 
SORRY THEY WERE MADE BY THIS ONE'S STAMPED MECCANO 
SOME OF THEM ARE BY HORNBY AND BRITAINS 
THEY'RE JUST GREAT YEAH LOVELY 
SPENCER COULD USE THIS TO TURN INTO SUPERMAN WHO'S SPENCER OUR LITTLE BOY HE'D LOVE THIS 
WE SHOULD KEEP THESE THE TROUBLE IS IF HE LICKED THAT HE'D PROBABLY GET LEAD POISONING FROM THE PAINT 
YOU DON'T EVEN SEE ROAD SIGNS ALL YOU SEE NOW IS SPEED CAMERAS

JUST THE RIGHT SIZE FOR OUR LAWN TOO YEAH 
WHAT IT'S DOING IN THIS COLLECTION I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY ARE WHAT WILL THEY MAKE AT AUCTION 
I THINK THEY'D MAKE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND THIRTY QUID 
I LIKE THEM THEY'RE VERY TACTILE 
I LIKE THE FACT THAT THEY'VE BEEN PLAYED WITH THEY'RE A BIT BASHED 
CHILDREN HAVE LOVED THOSE AND PLAYED WITH THEM 
I RECKON YOU DID THE DEAL ON THE LAST LOT I'LL HOLD THEM 
THE DEALER KNOWS I'VE GOT THEM WHAT WILL YOU PAY TWENTY AND NO MORE 
GIVE IT A TRY OFF YOU GO 
HOW WILL HE GET ON HE'LL DO O. K. 
DAVID WAS TRUE TO HIS WORD AND GOT THEM FOR TWENTY QUID 
OH LOOK THIS IS INTERESTING GOSH HOW DO YOU GET INTO THEM 
THAT'S THE FIRST TASK YOU KEEP DARTING OFF I CAN'T FIND YOU SORRY CHARLES 
WE QUITE LIKE THESE COMPASSES 
THESE ARE SECOND WORLD WAR SO NINETEEN FORTIES ONE IS DATED NINETEEN FORTY ONE 
EARLIER I SPOKE TO THE GENTLEMAN ON THIS STAND 
AND HE TOLD ME THESE ONCE BELONGED TO A CHAP IN NANTWICH WHO SERVED ON A FRIGATE ON THE RUSSIAN CONVOY 
WE SEE A LOT OF REPRODUCTIONS BUT THESE WITH THAT PROVENANCE WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT 
CLARIFIES THAT THEY ARE ORIGINAL 
DO THESE SELL WELL AT AUCTION 
THEY DO SELL WELL WITH THE RIGHT SALE AND RIGHT EXPOSURE 
THERE ARE SPECIALIST LONDON SALES WITH SUCH COMPASSES AND SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS 
THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY WELL LOOKED AFTER HAVEN'T THEY ABSOLUTELY 
THEY ARE WELL MADE AND IN GOOD CONDITION 
WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT MARKS ON THE BASE THEY'VE BEEN POLISHED A BIT 
SO THEY'VE LOST A BIT OF ORIGINAL COLOUR 
THAT ONE ALSO HERE HAS A SLIGHT BLEMISH IN THE GLASS 
THEY WERE MADE TO BE USED 
SO THIS ONE'S AT NINETY FIVE THAT ONE'S AT SEVENTY FIVE O. K. 
HOW MUCH WOULD THEY SELL FOR AT AUCTION THAT'S ALWAYS THE QUESTION 
I QUITE LIKE THESE I'D ALMOST BUY THESE AS A PAIR RIGHT O. K. 
TO REALLY STIR UP INTEREST AND HOPEFULLY AID COMPETITION 
I WOULD PUT THEM INTO THE SALE FOR THE TWO TOGETHER WIND BEHIND THEM FACING NORTH 
MY AUCTION G. U. I. D. E. ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOR THE TWO TOGETHER 
IF YOU COULD BUY THEM AT THAT MID ESTIMATE AIM FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
YEAH I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU YOU'RE VERY DECISIVE THANK YOU YEARS OF PRACTICE I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT 
THE GIRLS GOT THEM FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
HOW ARE YOU DOING DOING WELL JUST FOUND THIS 
I LOVE THAT AND IT'S GOT A STAND AS WELL 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT TELLS ME THAT BEFORE YOU EVEN GET THERE 
IT'S THE TOP OF A SPIRIT KETTLE BECAUSE THE HINGE THERE OPENS THAT WAY OH RIGHT 
IT DOESN'T COME BACK THAT WAY OR ON MANY KETTLES THERE'D BE NO HINGE 
ANYTHING ELSE STRIKE YOU ABOUT IT WHAT OH 
YOU'VE GOT A REALLY NICE PLAIN NUT ON THE END OF THERE AND IT'S QUITE NICELY FINISHED 
ON THIS END I WOULD THINK SOMETHING HAS BEEN LOST DURING TIME 
THAT'S BEEN JUST STUCK ON THERE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE BASE THIS ALMOST WOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF AN UPMARKET EDWARDIAN PICNIC SET 
THERE'S THE BURNER THE SPIRIT GOES IN THERE 
AND THIS WOULD SIT ON THERE LIKE THUS SO IT'S A REAL COOL THING 
IT'S GORGEOUS I'LL PUT THAT DOWN I NOTICED A MARK ON THE BOTTOM 
I'M JUST GONNA GET THE OLD MAGNIFIER OUT THERE WE ARE LOOK 
H. AND AMP H. RIGHT HUKIN AND HEATH 
THEY EMPLOYED THE SERVICES OF ONE DOCTOR CHRISTOPHER DRESSER 
RIGHT AND HE WAS LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF HIS TIME IN TERMS OF DESIGN 
A REALLY INNOVATIVE MAN 
I DON'T THINK IT'S BY HIM AT ALL 
IF IT WAS A SPIRIT KETTLE LIKE THAT IN SILVER PLATE MIGHT MAKE BETWEEN FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
WE SHOULD GET THAT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS CHRISTOPHER DRESSER I COULD SEE THAT HOW MUCH IS IT FIFTY FIVE 
IT REALLY IS INEXPENSIVE AND THERE'S A HUGE BUT COMING THEY'RE OUT OF FASHION ARE THEY 
I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR IT YOU CAN MAKE THIRTY TO FIFTY 
I'LL SEE IF I CAN GET IT FOR THIRTY FIVE O. K. GOOD LUCK TO YOU 
THEY BOUGHT IT FOR ONLY THIRTY FIVE A BARGAIN 
OUR CONTESTANTS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES LOOKING FOR A BARGAIN TODAY 
THE EXPERTS WILL USE THE LEFTOVER LOLLY TO FIND A BONUS BUY 
RESCUE ME 
TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS RESCUE ME 
I FEEL LIKE CALLING YOU MY SWEETHEARTS VERY KIND OF YOU 
I DO WHY IS THAT IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THESE 
EXACTLY WHAT ARE THEY MILITARY COMPACTS YES YOU'RE RIGHT 
BACK IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES WHEN AN AMERICAN SERVICEMAN WAS OBVIOUSLY OVERSEAS 
DOING HIS THING HE WOULD HAVE SENT HIS SWEETHEART BACK ONE OF THESE COMPACTS AS A LOVE TOKEN 
WE KNOW THE HENRIETTA COMPANY MADE THESE IN THE LATE THIRTIES EARLY FORTIES 
THEY ARE PLASTIC BECAUSE THEY'RE QUITE FRAGILE LOTS WERE LOST 
THESE ARE REMARKABLE SURVIVORS IS THE PLASTIC O. K. 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF LITTLE MARKS ON IT GIVEN THEIR AGE THEY'RE WELL LOOKED AFTER 
WOULD THEY SELL WELL AT AUCTION 
IT'S A FEMININE OBJECT BUT I GUESS MOST MILITARY COLLECTORS ARE MALE 
YEAH LIKE SCENT BOTTLES THEY ARE CURIOUS OBJECTS SOCIALLY INTERESTING IN FAIR CONDITION 
BUT THEY ARE EXTREMELY NICE 
AND COLLECTABLE YES ANYTHING NOVEL SELLS WELL O. K. 
THE ROMANCE OF IT IS NICE WHAT ARE THEY WORTH 
SENTIMENT'S PRICELESS ISN'T IT 
YES THEY ARE A CHAPTER OF HISTORY WHICH LEAVES A LOT TO THINK ABOUT 
THEY COULD DO EITHER OF TWO THINGS 
THEY COULD RACE AWAY AND MAKE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOR THE TWO TOGETHER OR FALTER AND MAKE FIFTY IT DEPENDS ON THE DAY 
AND THESE SORTS OF OBJECTS TO MY MIND ARE HIT OR MISS 
THEY'RE PRICED AT EIGHTY NINE EACH EACH YES CRIKEY 
THAT'S EXPENSIVE I THINK THEY'RE OVERPRICED 
BUT IF YOU CAN HAGGLE HAGGLE HARD IN THE WAY I KNOW YOU CAN 
NO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND THEY MIGHT STAND A CHANCE 
I'M HOPING FINGERS CROSSED SHALL WE GO HAGGLE LET'S GO HAGGLE 
THEY PAID A WHOPPING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SMACKERS 
TIME'S UP LET'S SEE WHAT THEY'VE GOT 
THE REDS ARE SHOUTING THEIR WAY TO THE AUCTION WITH THE BELL FOR TWENTY 
THE SET OF BATTERED ROAD SIGNS FOR ANOTHER TWENTY SMACKERS 
INCLUDING A WORKING LAWNMOWER 
AND THE DECORATIVE SPIRIT KETTLE WITH ODD NUTS 
FOR ONLY THIRTY FIVE FOR A NUTTER 
WAS THAT GOOD FUN BRILLIANT 
WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE PIECE THE SILVER KETTLE DO YOU AGREE DAVID ABSOLUTELY 
IT SEEMS TO ME YOU AGREE WITH EVERYTHING HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND 
JUST SEVENTY FIVE IT'S THE FIRST TIME MY WIFE'S NOT SPENT TO THE LIMIT 
ONLY SEVENTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE LEFTOVER LOLLY THERE YOU GO PHILIP 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT WASTE NOT WANT NOT WHAT WILL YOU SPEND IT ON 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET PERHAPS A BIT OF WOOD 
THAT SOUNDS TYPICAL LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE BLUES BOUGHT 
THE BLUES KICK OFF THE AUCTION WITH A FOOTBALL FIRST DAY COVER FOR FORTY 
THE WARTIME COMPACTS WERE SNAPPED UP FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY WOW 
THEY GOT THE COMPASSES FOR ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
WILL THEY LEAD THEM TO A PROFIT 
THAT WAS FUN IT WAS GREAT YOU HAD A GOOD TIME EXCELLENT 
WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE ITEM WE COULDN'T DECIDE FOR ME IT WAS THE LITTLE MILITARY HAT COMPACTS 
THAT WON IT FOR ME TODAY HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY 
TWENTY BACK WILL YOU BE ABLE TO BUY SOMETHING WITH THAT PALTRY TWENTY 
IT'S GONNA BE A GAMBLE IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT YES IT IS 
BUT YOU'RE OUR MAN I HOPE SO RIGHT NOW I'M HEADING OFF UPSTREAM 
BEFORE DOING BATTLE AT AUCTION TIME TO FACE ANOTHER UNRULY CROWD 
LOOK AT THAT LOT 
HERE WE ARE IN BRITAIN'S OLDEST AMPHITHEATRE 
THROUGH THAT DOORWAY TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE BRAVE GLADIATORS WOULD HAVE ENTERED 
NEARLY HALF THE AMPHITHEATRE CAN BE SEEN TODAY JUST OUTSIDE CHESTER'S ROMAN WALL 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ASTONISHING STRUCTURE AND THEY'RE STILL EXCAVATING IT TODAY 
COMING UP WITH NEW FINDS AND REINVENTING WHAT THE AMPHITHEATRE WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE 
THE AMPHITHEATRE WAS DISCOVERED IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE 
BUT IT WAS DURING EXCAVATION IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
THAT SOME ARCHAEOLOGISTS FIRST THOUGHT IT WAS ORIGINALLY ONLY A TIMBER STRUCTURE 
GROOVES LIKE THESE SHOW THE LINE OF WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WOODEN PLANKS 
AND THERE'S A THEORY THAT THERE WAS A WOODEN AMPHITHEATRE HERE ENCLOSED BY THESE STONE WALLS 
BUT WHAT BECAME CLEAR WAS THE TIMBER WAS SIMPLY EXTRA SEATING 
INSIDE THE MODEST STONE AMPHITHEATRE 
IT PROBABLY HELD A COUPLE OF THOUSAND SPECTATORS 
THIS IS THE OUTER WALL OF THE ORIGINAL AMPHITHEATRE 
RECENT EXCAVATIONS HAVE REVEALED THAT ONE HUNDRED YEARS LATER 
THEY EXTENDED THE AMPHITHEATRE AND THIS IS THE NEW OUTER WALL 
THE SCALE OF THE MASSIVE OUTER WALL SUGGESTS 
THIS SECOND MUCH LARGER AND IMPRESSIVE AMPHITHEATRE 
REPLACED OR WAS AN EXTENSION TO THE ORIGINAL STONE AND TIMBER STRUCTURE 
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SUCH A DEMAND TO SEE THE GLADIATOR SPECTACLES 
THEY HAD TO EXPAND IT TO HOLD SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE 
IT'S HERE BETWEEN THE WALLS WHERE SPECTATORS DISCARDED OR LOST THINGS 
THAT SOME OF THE INTERESTING FINDS PITCH UP TODAY 
THE AMPHITHEATRE WAS A BIT LIKE A FOOTBALL GROUND WITH CONCESSIONARY STALLS SELLING FOOD AND DRINK 
NOT SO MUCH BURGERS BUT PERHAPS A NICE PIECE OF TOASTED GOAT 
AND HERE WE'VE GOT A BIT OF GOAT BONE TO PROVE THE POINT 
HERE WE'VE GOT A LITTLE SHARD OF BONE FROM A ROMAN SOLDIER'S SWORD 
HITHER THEODORUS AVE WONNACOTT 
I'M NOT AWAY YET THERE IS THE SHARD OF THE ORIGINAL ROMAN BONE 
HERE ON THE REPRODUCTION SWORD YOU CAN SEE HOW SIMILAR IT IS 
NOW THEODORUS GO AND WOW THE CROWD WHAT THAT WAY 
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO LET HIM LIVE OR LET HIM DIE LET HIM LIVE OR LET HIM DIE 
LET HIM LIVE THEN AND WE'LL MAKE A KILLING AT THE AUCTION 
I WONDER WHAT'S IN STORE DOWN THE ROAD AT MOLD 
WE'RE IN THE VICTORIA AUCTION GALLERIES IN MOLD WITH ANTHONY PARRY NICE TO SEE YOU 
VERY NICE TO BE HERE THE RED TEAM DAVID AND JULIE HAVE BOUGHT THIS TRIO 
WHICH OUT OF THOSE THREE WOULD YOU QUITE FANCY NONE NONE

TEN IF WE'RE LUCKY YOU COULD SUMMON THE WIFE IN FROM THE GARDEN PROBABLY HIT ME OVER THE HEAD 
TEN TO FIFTEEN IS YOUR ESTIMATE YES THEY PAID TWENTY

NOW THE FIVE PIECES OF DIE CAST I WAS SPEECHLESS WHEN I SAW THOSE 
THEY'RE ALL KNOCKED ABOUT YES YOU'LL BE LUCKY TO GET A BID 
THAT'S A POUND OR TWO THEN YEAH 
TWENTY THEY PAID ROSE TINTED GLASSES OUR MONEY THAT'S WHAT IT WAS O. K. 
WHAT ABOUT THIS PLATED SPIRIT KETTLE IT DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD UNTIL YOU LOOK CLOSELY 
WRONG NUT WRONG NUT THERE BUT HUKIN AND AMP HEATH ARE GOOD MAKERS 
DIDN'T DRESSER DO SOME DESIGNS FOR THEM YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT LIFTS IT WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATE TWENTY TO THIRTY THIRTY FIVE PAID 
IT'S THE BEST OF THE LOT YES 
THEY'RE GONNA NEED THEIR BONUS BUY OH DEAR 
JULES DAVE YOU SPENT A PALTRY SEVENTY FIVE SORRY NOT PALTRY JUST TACTICAL MINIMUM LOSSES

IT'S STAVED OR COOPERED IT'S GOT THESE LOVELY BRASS BANDS ROUND IT 
THE THING ABOUT ANTIQUES IS COULD YOU BUY A NEW STICK STAND FOR SIXTY QUID 
YOU'RE PREDICTING A PROFIT WHY DO YOU KEEP ASKING THAT 
YOU'RE THE EXPERT WHAT YOU'RE THE EXPERT NICEST THING YOU'VE SAID 
I'M NOT THE EXPERT YOU SEE A PROFIT WILL YOU DOUBLE YOUR MONEY 
NO NO I'D LIKE TO THINK IF WE'RE LUCKY IT'LL MAKE A TWENTY QUID PROFIT 
IT'S ALL DOWN TO A BIT OF LUCK AND IT'LL ALL DEPEND ON HOW YOU'VE GOT ON WITH YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS 
SO WHAT DOES THE AUCTIONEER THINK 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS NINETEENTH CENTURY STICK BARREL

HE SEES A PROFIT NOT FAR OFF YOU'LL GIVE IT A BIT OF STICK YES 
NOW THE BLUES JULIE AND RACHEL

THEY DIDN'T PAY A HUGE AMOUNT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH THIRTY TO FORTY 
THAT'S NOT TOO BAD FORTY THEY PAID BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS
