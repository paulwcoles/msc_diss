HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW 
WITH CHRISTINE BLEAKLY AND ADRIAN 
CHILES AND A MAN ONCE DESCRIBED AS 
THE THINKING WOMAN'S CRUMP ET 
CLIVE JAMES 
THAT WAS A WHILE 
AGO ARE 
CLIVE'S BIT ON THE SIDES AGOARE AGGIE MACKENZIE AND LESS 
PROMISINGLY PHIL TUFNELL 
BIG DAN SNOW IS EXCLUSIVELY LIVE 
FOR US AT A VERY V. I. P. EVENT COME IN 
DAN DAN HELLO TEAM HOW IS IT GOING I'M 
VERY EXCITED I'M AT HENDON AIR 
DROME HOME OF THE R. A. F. MUSEUM 
WHERE BETTER FOR US TO COME TO 
EXCLUSIVELY HAVE A LOOK AROUND THE 
CELEBRATION OF THE NINETIETH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE R. A. F. NOW THE CENTRAL BAND OF 
THE R. A. F. ARE BEHIND ME PLAYING THE 
WONDERFUL EVENING HYMN THIS IS THE 
BIRTH PLACE OF THE R. A. F. IN SO MANY 
WAYS SO MANY FIRSTS HAPPENED HERE 
WE HAVE V. I. P.'S COMING OUT IN DROVES 
COMMANDERS OF ARMY NAVY AND AIR 
FORCE WE HAVE THE GRANDSON OF ONE 
OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE AIR FORCE 
JOIN ME LATER BECAUSE I'M GOING TO 
SHOW YOU SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL 
PLANES IN THE HISTORY OF BRITAIN 
THE PEOPLE ON THIS SOFA TONIGHT 
HAVE BEEN SERVING AN INSTITUTION 
FOR NEARLY AS LONG AS THE R. A. F. HAVE 
BEEN SERVING THE NATION FOR ADRIAN 
IT'S TEN YEARS 
AGGIE EIGHTEEN YEARS AND CLIVE A 
WHOPPING FORTY YEARS 
CHRISTINE ON THE OTHER HAND HAS 
ZERO YEARS OF SERVICE WHICH IS WHY 
SHE MAY BE HAPPIER THAN THE REST OF 
US WE REFER TO MARRIED LIFE 
NEW FIGURES SUGGEST IT'S A 
TRADITION IN CRISIS WITH MARRIAGES 
DOWN AND DIVORCES UP TO RECORD 
BREAKING LEVELS WHO'S GOING TO 
STAND UP FOR MARRIED LIFE THEN 
AGGIE MACKENZIE 
I GOT HITCHED EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO NOW IT 
SEEMS 
SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY 
BUT THESE DAYS FOR SOME PEOPLE 
MARRIAGE IS NOTHING BUT TROUBLE AND 
STRIFE THE LATEST FIGURES SHOW 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FEWER PEOPLE A YEAR HAVE 
DECIDED TO SAY I DO COMPARED WITH 
NINETEEN FIFTY FOR ALMOST HALF THE COUPLES 
WALKING DOWN THE AISLE IT WILL END 
IN DIVORCE RATHER THAN 'TIL DEATH 
US DO PART IT'S TIME TO ASK 
MARRIAGE WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR 
MARRIAGE IS GOOD FOR ABSOLUTELY 
NOTHING 
I DON'T THINK EVERY GIRL NOTHING FAPBT SIZES ABOUT THE BIG DRESS IT IT CEMENTS YOU TOGETHER 
IT GIVES YOU 
AN ANCHOR 
HE'S MY FRIEND MY ROCK 
MY HUSBAND 
FOR ME IT'S A 
GENERATIONAL THING WHEN I WAS 
YOUNGER IF YOU WEREN'T MARRIED 
PEOPLE THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING 
WRONG WITH YOU ESPECIALLY IF YOU 
WERE A WOMAN THE UNMARRIED MOTHER 
A WANTON WOMAN WHO HAD CHILDREN OUT 
OF WEDLOCK THE DIVORCEE OR WIDOW 
WOMEN WHO MANAGED TO LOSE THEIR MAN 
BUT WORST OF ALL THE SPIN 
CERTIFICATE LEFT ON THE SHELF SHE 
WAS THE WOMAN WHO NEVER MANAGED TO 
GET A MAN AT ALL 
THANK GOODNESS WE'VE MOVED ON FROM 
THOSE TIMES 
SO WHAT'S THE PLUS SIDE OF GETTING 
MARRIED MARRIED MARRIAGE IS INCREDIBLY GOOD FOR YOU 
IN TERMS OF HEALTH WEALTH AND HOW 
LONG YOU LIVE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
MARRIED LIVE LONGER SUBSTANTIALLY 
LONGER IT'S ON AVERAGE SEVEN TO 
TEN YEARS LONGER THE EFFECT OF 
GETTING MARRIED ON YOUR HEALTH IS 
CERTAINLY PROBABLY EQUIVALENT TO 
GIVING UP SMOKING 
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK THE FUTURE OF MARRIAGE IS 
GIVEN THE CURRENT TRENDS 
IF THINGS 
CARRY ON AS THEY HAVE BEEN FOR THE 
LAST TWELVE YEARS MARRIAGE WILL BECOME 
MUCH LESS COMMON 
I WANT TO MARRY BROOK 
THAT'S OUR 
NEIGHBOUR NEIGHBOUR IT'S NOT EASY IT IS HARD 
IF YOU 
ARE BLESSED WITH MARRIED LIFE WITH 
ANY LUCK YOU WERE 
I'VE NEVER 
BEEN BORED WITH MY WIFE 
I SUPPOSE 
I HAVE OCCASIONALLY OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY MARRIAGE ISN'T FOR EVERYONE BUT 
THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID FOR IT SO 
I WON'T BE GIVING THE OLD BALL AND 
CHAIN A PUSH QUITE YET HIM INDOORS 
WILL BE PLEASED 
CLIVE IT'S ODD THE WORDS WE USE 
TO DESCRIBE MARRIAGE INSTITUTION 
AND WEDLOCK A WOMAN THERE TALKED 
ABOUT CEMENTING TOGETHER THEY'RE 
NOT THE MOST PLEASANT WORDS YEAH YEAH IT SOUNDS LIKE A PRISON BUT WHAT 
WOULD YOUR LIFE HAVE BEEN LIKE IF 
YOU HAD BEEN FREE FOR SOME MEN 
IT'S THE ONLY CIVILISING FORCE 
WITHOUT IT WE'D BE WILD ANIMALS 
SOME OF US STILL ARE WILD ANIMALS 
MARRIED OR NOT IT'S TO SAVE MEN 
FROM THEMSELVES 
AS FAR AS MEN ARE 
CONCERNED SOMETIMES I WILL WONDER 
WHAT'S IN IT FOR WOMEN I'VE BEEN 
MARRIED FORTY YEARS THE MAIN REASON 
I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR FORTY YEARS I 
NEVER SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT I'M 
SURROUNDED BY WOMEN WHO WOULD KILL 
ME IF I DID THAT'S THE DEAL ALSO 
THE MINUTE YOU BOAST YOU GOT AWAY 
WITH IT YOU END UP IN THE DIVORCE 
COURT AND START HANDING EACH OTHER 
LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY WHERE 
LAWYERS TAKE HALF THAT'S THE BIG 
THING ABOUT DIVORCE THE LAWYERS 
GET HALFAGGIE 
MOVING AWAY FROM 
DIVORCE AND BACK TO MARRIAGE 
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED MANY YEARS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN LIKE IF YOU HADN'T GOT 
MARRIED TO BE FREE 
I WONDER TOO 
MANY PARTIES AND I WOULDN'T HAVE MY 
BEAUTIFUL SONS THAT'S THE BIG PLUS 
FOR ME 
EVEN THOSE PEOPLE WHO PROFESS TO BE 
AGAINST MARRIAGE SEEM TO HANKERING 
AFTER THE SPECIAL PERSON 
I HEARD 
THIS IS MONDAY OGG ME ON THE UP AS 
MARRIAGE IS ON THE DOWN 
WHAT THEY 
ALLUDE TO 
I THINK SOMEBODY IS 
FOOLING THEMSELVES SOMEWHERE HAVE HAVE YOU GOT A STORY TO TELL US CLIVE 
PEOPLE ARE COMPLICATED THEY'RE 
CAPABLE OF HANKERING TO BE FREE AND 
ALSO BEING GRATEFUL TO BE STABLE 
IT'S STABILITY THAT MATTERS I 
THINK THE MORTALITY FIGURES THAT 
PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET MARRIED DIE 
YOUNGER 
IT SOMETIMES RELIES ON YOUNGER WHAT YOU COME FROM MY PARENTS ARE 
MARRIED OVER THIRTY YEARS AND I HANKER 
A SIMILAR TYPE OF LIFE CAN WE PAY 
TRIBUTE TO THIS ONE COUPLE WE SAW 
THERE BRIEFLY L. WONDER IF THEY'RE 
STILL MARRIED 
THE TWO PEOPLE ON THE SOFA 
I'VE NEVER BEEN BORED WITH MY WIFE 
I SUPPOSE I HAVE OCCASIONALLY 
SHE'S STILL BORED OCCASIONALLY AND AND THEY SURVIVED THE SHOCK WHEN 
SOMEBODY CAME UP AND TOOK THE HOUSE 
AWAY AWAY ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN LET US KNOW 
WHAT YOU THINK 
ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK 
THE USUAL ADDRESS 
AGGIE THINKS SO 
IT'S ALL BIG HANDSOME DAN SNOW 
LOOKING EVERY INCH THE R. A. F. OFFICER 
AT THE ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS 
LET'S GO BACK TO HENDON AIR DROME 
NOW DAN 
HI ADRIAN AND CHRISTINE I'M AFRAID 
I GET OVEREXCITED IN PLACES LIKE 
THIS IT'S LINE ACHE ALAD INS CAVE 
WHAT YOU SAW ALADDIN'S CAVE 
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS 
AIRCRAFT THE HARRIER JUMP JET 
THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST AIRCRAFT 
THAT COULD COME UP AND DOWN 
VERTICAL LIFT R. A. F. PILOTS FLEW THAT 
PLANE IN THE FALKLANDS BUT IT WAS 
ALL DIFFERENT NINETY YEARS AGO LOOK AT 
THAT CANVAS AND WOOD BI PLANE TWO 
VICARS MACHINE GUNS ON THE FRONT 
THAT SHOOT THROUGH THE PROPELLER 
TERRIFYING BUT THEY DID THE JOB IT 
WAS STAR OF THE R. A. F. FIVE THOUSAND WERE 
BUILT BY THE END OF THE FIRST WORLD 
WAR THIS ONE IS GREAT THE 
MOSQUITO USED FOR ALL SORTS OF 
THINGS DURING WORLD WAR TWO NIGHT 
FIGHTING TAKING PICTURES OF ENEMY 
POSITIONS IT'S MADE OUT OF WOOD 
THE THING IS ENOUGH OF TALKING 
ABOUT AIRCRAFT WHAT I'D REALLY 
LIKE TO DO IS TAKE ONE OF THESE 
ONES FOR A TEST DRIVE 
THIS IS THE LATEST EDITION TO THE 
ROYAL AIR FORCE IT'S THE TYPHOON 
ONE OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED 
COMBAT AIRCRAFT EVER BUILT ONLY 
THE VERY BEST PILOTS IN THE R. A. F. GET 
TO FLY HERE AND PARKY IS THE BEST 
OF THE BEST HE'S TAKING ME UP 
TODAY TODAY THE ROYAL AIR FORCE HAS FORTY THREE Y. I. E. R. B. G. S. 
TYPHOONS IN IT'S ONE THOUSAND STRONG 
FLEET A FAR CRY FROM ITS EARLY 
DAYS OF MILITARY LIFE IN WORLD WAR 
ONE WHEN THE R. A. F. DIDN'T EXIST IN 
NINETEEN FOURTEEN BRITAIN HAD ONE HUNDRED TWELVE AIRCRAFT IN 
MILITARY SERVICE 
I'M ABOUT TO SEE HOW MUCH THINGS 
HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN 
THAT IS JUST INCREDIBLE 
WE'RE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND FEET HIGH FLYING 
AT MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND M. P. H. THROUGH THE 
STRATOSPHERE STRATOSPHERE OH MY GOODNESS 
I CAN'T 
BELIEVE IT CANNOT BELIEVE IT 
THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FLY AT THE 
CUTTING EDGE OF TECHNOLOGY NOW I'M 
GOING TO SEE WHERE IT ALL BEGAN 
THIS IS FIVE HUNDRED FOUR ONE OF THE EARLIEST 
MODELS TO BE USED IN BATTLE DURING 
WORLD WAR ONE THIS IS THE ONLY 
ORIGINAL STILL FLYING ANYWHERE IN 
THE WORLD TREVOR ROACHE IS HER 
PILOT IT'S A BEAUTY BUT IT'S VERY 
DIFFERENT FROM TYPHOON 
IT SURE IS 
IT HAS A WOODEN STRUCTURE COVERED 
IN LINEN IT HAS BICYCLE WHEELS IT IT FEELS LIKE A DRUM COVER YES IT'S YES IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ONLY NINETY YEARS 
SEPARATE THESE TWO AIRCRAFT THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT N. ITS DAY THIS WOULD HAVE 
BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF TECHNOLOGY 
CHOBGS AWAY BOYS IT WAS DESIGNED 
TO BE EASY TO FLY HER PIONEERING 
PILOTS SEVEN GIVEN ONLY BASIC TRAINING 
BEFORE THEY TOOK TO THE AIR 
YOU'RE CERTAINLY FLYING OUT HERE IN 
THE ELEMENTS IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
IT'S TERRIFYING ACTUALLY IT'S 
BUMPING AROUND A BIT UP HERE NOW 
I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S KEEPING THIS IN 
THE AIR 
BEFORE THE WAR THERE HAD BEEN 
DOUBTS ABOUT JUST HOW USEFUL PLANES 
WOULD BE IN BATTLE BUT THEIR 
POTENTIAL QUICKLY BECAME CLEAR 
INITIALLY PLANES WERE BIT OF 
AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE WAS WHAT 
THESE PLANES WERE USED FOR IN 
ORDER TO STOP THE ENEMY TAKING 
THEIR RECONNAISSANCE INFORMATION 
BACK TO BASE SOME OF THE PILOTS 
WOULD HAVE POT SHOT WITH THEIR 
REVOLVER AT ENEMY PLANES IT WASN'T 
LONG BEFORE MACHINE GUNS WERE BEING 
STRAPPED ON TO PLANES AND SMALL 
BOMBS TOSSED OVER THE SIDES IN 
EARLY VERSIONS OF THE FIGHTER AND 
THE BOMBER 
BETWEEN NINETEEN FOURTEEN AND NINETEEN EIGHTEEN BRITAIN'S 
FLEET OF AIRCRAFT GREW TO MORE THAN 
TWENTY THOUSAND AS AIR POWER CHANGED THE WAY 
THE WAR WAS FOUGHT FOREVER IN THE 
LAST FEW MONTHS OF FIRST WORLD WAR 
THE AIRCRAFT REALLY MADE THEIR MARK 
AND THE WAR CABINET SET UP 
SEPARATE AIR SERVICE TO SIT 
ALONGSIDE THE ARMY AND THE NAVY SO 
IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN EIGHTEEN THE R. A. F. WAS 
BORN BORN NOW IF YOU WERE A THRUSTING YOUNG 
OFFICER BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN THIS IS WHAT 
YOU WOULD BE WEARING IT'S 
EXTRAORDINARY HOW DOES IT FEEL 
WARM 
QUITE WARM BUT COLDER UP IN WARM THE AIR 
A COLLAR AND TIE YOU'RE 
PUTTING US TO SHAME INCLUDING THIS 
MAN HERE A GENUINE PILOT FLIGHT 
LIEUTENANT GUY LOCK THE KIT HAS 
CHANGED WHY ARE YOU LOOKING SO 
SCRUFFY 
IT'S CHANGED DUE TO SCRUFFY TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT OF THE KIT 
AND ALSO DUE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF 
THE JETS IN THE TYPHOON WE HAVE A 
JET THAT CAN PULL UP TO NINE G. IT 
WOULD MEAN SOMEONE MY SIDE CAN 
WEIGH UP TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY STONE IN THE 
COCKPIT THIS DRAINS A LOT OF THE 
BLOOD FROM THE BRAIN TO COMBAT 
THAT WE HAVE A FULL G. SUIT FROM 
THE BOTTOM UP WE HAVE THE FULL 
COVERING TROUSERS WHICH SQUEEZE THE 
LEGS AND THE ABDOMEN SO BLOOD 
REMAINS WHERE IT SHOULD BE IN THE 
BRAINS A JERKER IN THE JACKET 
FINALLY WE HAVE PRESSURE BREATHING 
SYSTEM WHICH FORCES AIR INTO YOUR 
LUNGS 
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE PART OF LUNGS SOME EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE WHAT'S 
IT LIKE TO FLY THESE THINGS IT'S IT'S INCREDIBLE TO FLY THE PERFORMANCE 
STAGGERING TO BE HONEST YOU DON'T 
FEEL AS MUCH G. BECAUSE OF THE SUIT 
IT'S BEEN DEVELOPED FOR THE TYPHOON 
AS A RESULT PULLING EIGHT G. FEELS ABOUT 
FIVE OR SIX IN OLDER KIT 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE 
R. A. F. R. A. F. G. FORCES HAVE YOU EVER PULLED NINE G. 
I PULLED NINE G. WATCHING THAT MOVIE 
LOVE AEROPLANES CAN STILL 
IDENTIFY EVERY AIRCRAFT IN I WAS 
BUFF ABOUT PLANES 
HAVE YOU BEEN UP 
IN A JET LIKE THAT 
I'VE BEEN UP IN 
ALMOST EVERYTHING INCLUDING 
COCKPIT FLYING L. WAS COVERING A 
FOOTBALL TEAM IN SAN FRANCISCOCIES 
CO AND ONE OF THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS 
THERE HAD A COLLECTION OF AIRCRAFT 
AND HE TOOK ME UP IN A COCKPIT 
TRAINER WITHOUT TELLING ME FIRST L. 
HAD A TASTE OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO 
BE IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR WHEN 
THEY HAD NOTHING TO FIGHT WITH 
HENDON IS MAGIC IT'S A VERY 
IMPORTANT PLACE 
I'VE NOT BEEN 
THERE L. MUST HAVE A LOOK LOOKING 
AT YOUR BOOK CULTURAL AMNESIA 
THIS BOOK 
A WEIGHTY TOME THERE 
ARE CHARACTERS IN THERE FROM 
HISTORY SOME OF THE WORLD'S 
GREATEST PEOPLE ANY AIRMEN THERE 
A LOT OF MILITARY PEOPLE INCLUDING 
THE MAN WHO INVENTED JAPANESE 
AVIATION AND PLANNED THE PEARL 
HARBOR ATTACK HE WAS ALSO A POET 
ONE OF THE STRANGE GREAT SOLDIERS 
WHO WERE ALSO ARTISTS GENERAL 
PATTEN IS ANOTHER ONE THE BOOK 
TRIES TO COVER EVERYTHING THAT 
INCLUDED WAR IS VERY IMPORTANT IN 
THIS BOOK L. HOPE IT'S QUITE 
ENTERTAINING THERE ARE SUBJECTS 
SUCH AS VERY BAD MOVIES INCLUDING 
POSSIBLY THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE 
CALLED WHERE EAGLES DARE 
THAT WAS 
FANTASTIC WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT LET'S BEGIN 
WITH RICHARD BURTON'S HAIR STYLE 
OVER ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE FEATURED IN THE 
BOOK VERY FEW WOMEN 
THAT'S NOT 
QUITE SO THE BOOK DEDICATED TO 
FOUR WOMEN IT'S A FEMINIST BOOK 
BUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NOT 
MANY FEMALE COMPETITORS FOR HITLER 
AND STALIN IS A GOOD SIGN IT'S 
ABOUT THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IT'S MORE 
OF A MAN'S WORLD THAN IT IS NOW 
BUT IT TAUGHT A LOT OF US BORN INTO 
IT TO WISH IT HAD BEEN A WOMEN'S 
WORLD INSTEAD 
IT SAYS IT TOOK YOU 
FORTY YEARS TO WRITE IT YOU MUST HAVE 
BEEN LIKE THIS WHEN YOU STARTED I I WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN OUR TEAM LOSING 
THERE WHAT 
DID 
YOU KNOW NOW THAT THEREWHAT YOU DIDN'T THEN L. READ A QUOTE 
FROM CAN I SAYING GERM ONCE SAYING 
CAN I SAYINGER THE ONLY THING YOU 
KNOW FOR SURE IS GETTING INTO THE 
SURE MAKE SURE THE CURTAIN IS 
INSIDE THE BATH 
IF I COULD GO BACK AGAIN I'D START 
OFF BY BEING OLD ONE OF THE 
REASONS I ENJOY GROWING OLDER IS 
YOU GROW WISER 
I'M FORTY ONE WHEN DOES 
IT KICK OFF 
AT FORTY ONE YOU'RE JUST A 
KID SOME OF US TAKE A LONG TIME TO 
LEARN THINGS IT'S A SLOW ROAD THE 
GETTING OF WISDOM 
SO YOU KEEP 
THINKING YOU DON'T THINK AT SIXTY FIVE 
YOU'LL GIVE UP 
DON'T QUIT YOU 
ENJOY IT SOME OF THE MOST 
WONDERFUL THINGS HAPPENING TO ME 
HAVE HAPPENED NOW ESPECIALLY IN 
THE ARTS 
TALKING OF ART WHEN IT 
COMES TO ART THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW 
MUCH SAY THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH BUT 
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY LIKE WHATEVER 
LITTLE YOU DO KNOW WHAT YOU DO 
LIKE SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE PERSON 
YOU ARE 
AND IN OUR NEW SERIES THE ART WE 
PUT ON OUR WALL SAYS A LOT ABOUT 
WHAT'S IN OUR HEADS 
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE ART HOUSE IN 
MANCHESTER THE ART WORK BELONGS TO 
ONE SHOW VIEWER ROB MARTIN HE 
LIVES IN THE CITY CENTRE HE WORKS 
IN MARKETING AND ENJOYS ALL TYPE FZ 
ART I'M MEETING PSYCHOLOGIST DOCTOR 
TOMAS HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING 
ABOUT ROB BUT HE'S CONFIDENCE THAT 
BY LOOKING AT ART FROM HIS HOME HE 
CAN DRAW UP CHARACTER ANALYSIS ARE 
YOU READY FOR THIS 
I AM 
LET'S DO 
IT FIRST UP WE HAVE AN ABSTRACT 
PIECE WITH NO NAME BY SHIRLEY 
DIAMOND 
I'D SAY IT'S A MAN WHO OWN DIAMOND THAT'S PIECE IT'S A VERY MASCULINE 
PIECE IT'S SQUARE A LOT OF 
STRUCTURE POSSIBLY SOMEBODY WITH A 
NEED FOR ORGANISATION BEING TIDY 
BEING STRUCTURED QUITE METICULOUS 
PERSON IF I HAD TO GUESS 
NEXT UP 
WE'VE GOT AN ORIGINAL ACOUNCILIC 
PAINTING OF NEW YORK IN THE RAIN 
CALLED UMBRELLAS FIFTH AVENUE BY 
DAVID FARROW 
IT IS A MAIN STREAM 
PAINTING AT THE SAME TIME IT'S AN 
ORIGINAL THERE'S AN EFFORT INVEST 
SOME RESOURCE NOOZ ART IT'S STILL 
MAIN STREAM THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO 
IS QUITE RESERVED MORE INTROVERTED 
THAN EX TRO VERITYED IT'S PROBABLY 
SOMEBODY URBAN AND YOUNG AS WELL 
LAST BUT BY NO MEANS LEAST IS 
THIS PAINTING BY ANOTHER LOCAL LAD 
MARTIN MURRAY THIS IS WHERE WE ARE 
NOW 
THAT'S HIGHLY SYMBOLIC IT NOW SHOWS WHAT IMPORTANT CENTRAL PLACE 
ART HAS IN THIS PERSON'S LIFE THIS 
IS THE ART GALLERY WE ARE AT IT 
SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT MANCHESTER IS 
FOR THIS PERSON IT'S A HIGHLY 
REVEALING PICTURE OF THE THREE 
WE'VE SEEN THIS IS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT ONE THERE'S A LOT OF 
COLOUR NOW BUT STILL QUITE 
NOSTALGIC GLOOMY AND NOT VERY 
REVEALING OF THE PERSON'S EMOTION 
WE CAN SAY THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO 
DOESN'T REVEAL A LOT ABOUT HIS 
EMOTION I'M INCLINED TO SAY IT'S A 
MAN 
WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE WE MAN GOING TO FIND 
A YOUNG MAN OR 
SOMEBODY WHO AT LEAST FEELS VERY 
YOUNG IF HE'S NOT VERY YOUNG 
SOMEBODY VERY ARTISTIC AND 
SOMEBODY WHO IS VERY OBSERVANT 
THOUGHTFUL AND WHO CARES A LOT 
ABOUT ART L. WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED 
IF THIS PERSON WORKS IN AN ART 
RELATED PROFESSION 
LET'S GO AND SEE TIME TO PUT THE 
THEORY TO THE TEST FIRST UP THE 
UNTITLED ABSTRACT 
WHAT I LIKE 
ABOUT 
UNTITLED ABSTRACT WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE ABSTRACT ONE IS THE 
SIMPLICITY OF IT L. LIKE THE WILD 
QUALITY OF IT BUT IT'S WELL 
ORGANISED IT REMINDS ME OF A FIELD 
IN THE COUNTRY SIDE ORGANISED WE ORGANISED WE THOUGHT THIS WASN'T VERY REVEALING 
IT WAS AN ENIGMA WE PICKED UP ON 
THE FACT THAT IT MIGHT BELONG TO 
SOMEBODY WHO IS ORGANISED TIDY 
AND SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T WANT TO 
REVEAL TOO MUCH ABOUT HIMSELF DO 
YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT 
SPOT ON 
ACTUALLY 
NOT TOO BAD IT'S FREAKY ACTUALLY THE SECOND ONE 
IT'S A ROMANTIC 
SCENE NEW YORK IS A ROMANTIC CITY 
DID WE PICK UP ON THE ROMANCE NOT NOT THAT MUCH BUT WE SAID IT WAS 
SOMEBODY WHO WAS QUITE URBAN AND 
LIKES BIG CITIES WE CAN SEE HOW 
URBAN YOU ARE AND THAT IT'S 
SOMEBODY WHO LIKES THE CROWDS BUT 
BEING LOST IN THE CROWD NOT REALLY 
PART OF IT ESSENTIALLY MAYBE QUITE 
RESERVED MORE INTROVERTED THAN 
EXTROVERTED DO YOU THINK THAT'S 
RIGHT 
I'M GETTING A BIT SCARED NOW RIGHT THIRD ONE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
TELL US YOUR FEELINGS ON THAT ONE 
FOR ME IT'S A GREAT PAINTING 
BECAUSE IT'S A PERSON I USED TO 
WORK AT IT WAS THE LEAVING GIFT 
FOR WHEN I LEFT 
IT WAS THE MOST 
REVEALING OF THE THREE PAINTINGS 
BECAUSE IT SHOWED HOW IMPORTANT ART 
IS FOR YOU IT'S NOT JUST AN ART 
GALLERY BUT ALSO A SYMBOLIC 
PICTURE OF PLACES I DIDN'T KNOW 
YOU WORKED THERE BUT I THOUGHT IT 
WAS SOMEBODY WHO IS INVOLVED IN THE 
ARTS PERFECT
