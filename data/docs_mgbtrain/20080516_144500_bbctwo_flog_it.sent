WE'RE TWENTY MINUTES FROM THE BUSTLE OF CENTRAL LONDON IN RICHMOND UPON THAMES 
WELCOME TO FLOG IT 
THIS AREA'S JAM PACKED WITH PUBLIC HOUSES 
IT MUST BE TO DO WITH TODAY'S VENUE 
THE WORLD FAMOUS TWICKENHAM STADIUM WHICH DOMINATES THE SKYLINE 
CASTING THEIR EYES OVER ALL THE UNWANTED ANTIQUES IN THESE BAGS 
ARE THE ELITE SQUAD OF EXPERTS DAVID BARBY AND PHILIP SERRELL 
THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE AND PHILIP IS ALREADY WATCHING THE CLOCK 
LOOK AT MY HAIR THAT IS BRILLIANT 
YOUR HAIR IS MAGNIFICENT IT'S ALL DIFFERENT COLOURS 
IT'S DYED HENNA WHY DO YOU DO THAT I WANT MY HAIR TO LOOK GOLDY 
LIKE GOLDILOCKS OR WHOOPI GOLDBERG 
WHOOPI THERE'S A LIKENESS 
YEAH I WON A LOOKALIKE COMPETITION 
HOW MUCH DID YOU WIN ONE HUNDRED AND SOME PEANUT BUTTER 
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS FROM THIS BELONGED TO MY LATE FATHER IN LAW 
SOMEBODY GAVE IT TO HIM AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
THIS PERSON USED TO RUN AN ANTIQUES SHOP IN TWICKENHAM 
AFTER THE WAR HE PACKED UP AND WANTED TO GO BACK TO FRANCE 
DO YOU LIKE IT YES I LIKE IT 
BUT IT JUST SITS AND COLLECTS DUST 
IT'S A BIT RITZY FOR ME 
ORIGINALLY IT WOULD HAVE SAT UNDERNEATH A LARGE GLASS DOME 
IT'S EMBLEMATIC OF THE SCIENCES WE'VE GOT DIVIDERS HERE THE GLOBE 
WE'VE GOT GALILEO NEWTON 
IT'S REALLY DECORATIVE ISN'T IT 
YES THAT'S WHY I LIKED IT BUT AS YOU SAY THE GLASS DOME IS MISSING 
YOU CAN BUY REPLACEMENTS 
OH REALLY I DIDN'T KNOW THAT 
YOU CAN BUY BRAND NEW GLASS DOMES YEAH 
IT ISN'T THE BEST CLOCK IN THE WORLD THERE'S DAMAGE TO IT 
IN TERMS OF DATE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE BACK END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
I'M ASSUMING THERE'S NO MAKER'S MARKS ON THE BACK 
NO NO DATES 
NOT THAT I KNOW OF 
IT COULD BE ON THE BOTTOM 
WE'D HAVE TO TAKE THE DIAL OFF AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY MAKER'S MARK 
THE AUCTION ROOM WILL DO THAT FOR US YES 
IF IT'S BY A REALLY GOOD MAKER WHICH I DOUBT IT IS 
BUT IF IT'S BY A GOOD MAKER THEY'LL PUT THAT IN THE CATALOGUE AND ADJUST THE ESTIMATE 
THE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY A BIG PIECE 
YOU DON'T REALISE THIS SITTING IN THIS BIG HALL 
YOU PUT THAT ON A MANTELPIECE OR TABLE 
AND IT'S A REALLY IMPOSING THING YES IT IS 
THAT MIGHT JUST HOLD IT BACK IN TERMS OF VALUE 
COS NOT EVERYONE CAN ACCOMMODATE IT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BIG HOUSES AND HIGH CEILINGS 
YES THAT WOULD LOOK NICE IN THE HALLWAY THEY'LL NEED TO YES 
IN TERMS OF VALUE I THINK AT AUCTION IT'LL MAKE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
THAT'LL BE MY SHOT FOR IT 
I'D LIKE TO PUT A RESERVE ON IT OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE A FIXED RESERVE 
I THINK THAT SOMEONE WILL BUY IT IT'S A GOOD LOOKING LOT 
YES IT IS IT'S A DECORATIVE LOT IT'S QUITE NICE HAPPY WITH THAT 
YES FINE I'M HAPPY WITH IT 
SO WHAT WILL THE TWO HUNDRED DO MORE HAIR EXTENSIONS 
I THINK IF I GET THE MONEY I'VE GOT A PLACE IN SPAIN 
SO I'LL USE IT TO DO THE PLACE UP WITH 
GOOD LET'S HOPE IT DOES WELL 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HOPE SO TOO 
SYLVIA I'M QUITE INTRIGUED BY THIS PAINTING 
WHERE DID IT COME FROM WERE YOU BORN IN THE NORTH I WAS BORN IN LONDON 
YOU WERE BORN IN LONDON 
WHERE DID YOU GET THE PAINTING MY AUNT GAVE IT TO ME FIFTY YEARS AGO 
RIGHT DID SHE COME FROM THE NORTH NO SHE WAS BORN LOCAL 
SO YOU'RE BOTH LONDON GIRLS YES WE WERE 
THE REASON I ASK IS BECAUSE ERNEST DADE IS A WELL KNOWN NORTHERN ARTIST 
SO A LOT OF THE SUBJECT MATTER LIKE THIS SAILING BOAT 
IS OF THE NORTH SCARBOROUGH WHITBY ROBIN HOOD BAY 
THAT SORT OF AREA 
BUT HE SPENT SOME TIME IN CHELSEA SO WHERE DID YOUR AUNT LIVE 
SHE LIVED AT BATTERSEA AH WELL THERE WE ARE 
SHE PROBABLY BOUGHT THIS OR ACQUIRED IT 
WHEN HIS ESTATE WAS SOLD I THINK HE DIED IN CHELSEA 
IT MAY HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED THEN 
I THINK IT WILL SELL WELL ANYWHERE BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY 
THIS IS A WATERCOLOUR ON PAPER 
IT'S BEAUTIFULLY DONE 
THEY SAY THERE'S A GREATER SKILL IN WATERCOLOURISTS THAN IN OIL PAINTERS 
IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE ON A WATERCOLOUR YOU CAN'T OBLITERATE IT 
YOU CAN WITH AN OIL PAINTING 
THIS IS HIGH QUALITY I LOVE THE SKY DETAIL 
IT'S ALMOST IMPRESSIONISTIC 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED 
IS WHERE IT ORIGINATED FROM 
YOU TOLD ME YOUR AUNT ACQUIRED IT POSSIBLY FROM THE ESTATE OF DADE 
WHEN HE DIED IN CHELSEA BUT IF WE TURN IT ROUND 
HENRY WHITLEY SCARBOROUGH 
SO HE WAS THE RETAILER THAT IT WAS ORIGINALLY ACQUIRED FROM 
THIS SCRIBBLE HERE EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY THREE 
MEANS THAT IT HAD BEEN UP FOR AUCTION 
OH I SEE SO YOUR AUNT ACQUIRED IT FROM AN AUCTION 
MAYBE AT THE TIME THAT DADE HAD DIED 
IT'S THIS CHELSEA CONNECTION AND YOUR AUNT AT BATTERSEA 
WHICH IS SO INTRIGUING 
WHY ON EARTH ARE YOU SELLING IT 
I WANT TO DO A BIT OF DOWNSIZING IT DOESN'T GO WITH MY DECOR NOW 
IS IT THE LARGE GILT FRAME THAT DOESN'T GO 
YES I THINK SO AND I'M DOWNSIZING IT IS BIG WHEN PEOPLE DOWNSIZE 
IT IS A BIG PICTURE TO GO ON THE WALL YES 
I LIKE IT AND I THINK AT AUCTION THERE'LL BE A LOT OF INTEREST 
I THINK IT'LL BE OVER FIVE HUNDRED 
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT GO FOR SOMETHING LIKE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED 
OH LOVELY 
BUT THE AUCTIONEER MAY SAY LET'S PUT AN ESTIMATE OF EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED 
YES I THINK WE SHOULD PUT THE RESERVE AT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY 
LOVELY IS THAT AGREEABLE VERY AGREEABLE 
I SHALL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THIS AT AUCTION 
I HOPE YOU MAKE THE HIGHER FIGURE ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
MAUREEN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING AN ITEM OF FURNITURE WITH YOU 
IT'S MADE MY DAY YOU KNOW I LOVE WOOD YES 
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT WELL IT'S MY SEWING BOX 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD IT 
IT WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S AND MY MOTHER AND THEN TO ME 
IT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY THREE GENERATIONS USED AS A SEWING BOX 
IT'S NOT A SEWING BOX WE'VE SEEN ONLY ONE OTHER ON THE SHOW BEFORE 
IT'S A TEA POY YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHAT A TEA POY IS 
YES I AM IT'S LIKE A VERY LARGE TEA CADDY ON A STAND 
IT DATES TO THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTIES GOOD GOD 
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT'S MUCH OLDER THAN I THOUGHT 
LET'S LOOK INSIDE HOW DID YOU KEEP ALL YOUR SEWING IMPLEMENTS IN THERE 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT IT ALWAYS HAD SEWING STUFF IN IT 
WITH MY MOTHER AND I JUST CARRIED ON YEAH 
THIS SECTION WOULD BE FOR A GLASS MIXING BOWL YES 
SO YOU COULD BLEND DIFFERENT FUSIONS OF TEA 
EACH COMPARTMENT 
IF I LIFT ONE OUT 
THIS IS A CUBAN MAHOGANY WHICH WAS VERY FASHIONABLE IN THE MID SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS 
AND THIS IS A ROSEWOOD ALSO IMPORTED FROM THE WEST INDIES 
WHICH BECAME VERY FASHIONABLE IN THE EARLY EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS 
ALL THIS IS A VENEER IT'S STUCK ON TO THE MAHOGANY 
LOOK YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE TWO MILLIMETRES THERE YES 
THAT'S ROSEWOOD ISN'T IT DECORATIVE 
IT'S GOT THAT STRIKING GRAIN OF BLACKS ORANGES AND YELLOWS 
IF YOU OPEN UP ONE OF THOSE SECTIONS 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LINED WITH TIN FOIL CAN YOU SEE TRACES OF IT 
YES AND YOU CAN SEE IT IN THERE IN THERE 
THAT KEPT ALL THE TEA FRESH 
SO YOU'D HAVE BLACK TEA IN THERE AS ONE BLEND 
POSSIBLY YOU'D HAVE GREEN TEA IN THIS ONE 
AND YOU COULD MIX YOUR OWN BLEND 
AND HAVE ANOTHER COMPARTMENT FOR YOUR MIXTURE 
VERY INTERESTING ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S IN APPALLING CONDITION WAS IT ALWAYS LIKE THIS 
EVER SINCE I CAN WELL THIS PIECE AT THE SIDE THAT CAME OFF 
THE VENEER YOU'VE GOT THE SECTION I'VE GOT IT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN KEPT 
THAT CAN BE PUT BACK ON EASILY BY A RESTORER WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT 
THEN REMEMBERED SOMEBODY SAID DON'T DO IT LEAVE IT 
LEAVE IT ALONE LOOK AT THE STRIKING ARCHITECTURAL PROPORTIONS 
IT'S GOT LOVELY CURVETTO SIDES SEE THIS WAISTED SIDE 
YES IT JUST SOFTENS THE LOOK DOESN'T IT OH YES 
THE WHOLE BOX IS SUPPORTED BY THIS COLUMN THE PEDESTAL BASE WHICH TAPERS AT THE TOP 
AND IS ROCKING DOWN BY THE ACANTHUS LEAVES YES 
ONE THING THAT SOMEONE'S DONE IS PUT THIS ON I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S FROM 
THAT IS A FLOWER MOTIF FROM A PANEL OR SOMETHING 
THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE 
WHO DID THAT IF IT'S BEEN IN YOUR FAMILY ALL YOUR LIFE I'VE NO IDEA 
NO IT'S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT 
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA OF ITS VALUE 
NOT A CLUE IF I SAID THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED WOULD THAT SURPRISE YOU 
UM NO NOT REALLY 
I MEAN IT IS OLD AND IT'S NICE YEAH 
HAPPY TO FLOG IT THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED 
AND LET'S HOPE IT DOES THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MARK 
WE'LL PUT A FIXED RESERVE OF THREE HUNDRED COS WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY 
NO BEARING IN MIND IT GENERALLY NEEDS A BIT OF T. L. C. 
YES THAT'LL COST A COUPLE OF HUNDRED POUNDS I REALISE THAT 
YEAH LET'S DO IT THEN LET'S FLOG IT RIGHT 
PATRICK 
THIS IS A REALLY NICE BIT OF DOULTON HOW DID YOU COME BY IT 
I STARTED COLLECTING ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO I LIVED IN EDINBURGH THEN 
JUST ABOVE AN AUCTION ROOM PROBABLY WHERE I BOUGHT THIS 
SO YOU BOUGHT THIS THIRTY YEARS AGO YES HOW MUCH FOR 
ABOUT CAN'T HAVE BEEN MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE QUID I WOULD THINK 
IT'S DOULTON THE IMPRESS MARK'S HERE 
IT'S QUITE EARLY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
IT'S SALT GLAZED STONEWARE WHICH GIVES IT THIS ORANGE PEEL EFFECT 
THIS IS SGRAFFITO DECORATION 
A WOODEN SPATULA WOULD BE SCRATCHED INTO THE CLAY WHEN IT WAS GREEN 
OR NOT QUITE SET AND YOU GET THIS INCISED DECORATION 
THE NAME THAT SPRINGS TO MIND IS 
HANNAH BARLOW HANNAH BARLOW 
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S QUITE GOOD ENOUGH FOR HANNAH BARLOW 
COULD BE HER SISTER FLORENCE BARLOW 
SO WHAT WE'LL SAY IS IT'S A ROYAL DOULTON SALT GLAZED STONEWARE FLAGON 
DECORATED WITH RABBITS OR HARES ATTRIBUTED TO BARLOW 
AND WE'LL LEAVE IT AT BARLOW 
IF THE AUCTION ROOM WANT TO PUT HANNAH OR FLORENCE BARLOW 
THAT'S UP TO THEM IT WANTS AN ILLUSTRATION IN THE CATALOGUE 
WHETHER IT MIGHT HAVE HAD A SILVER COLLAR AT SOME TIME IS DEBATABLE 
IT MAKES YOU WONDER STYLISTICALLY YOU HAVE THE HARES HERE 
AND AT THE BACK IS THIS FOLIAGE 
I JUST WONDER WHETHER THEY'RE BOTH BY THE SAME HAND 
YES THEY MAY BE BY DIFFERENT HANDS 
THE OTHER THING THAT'S INTERESTING IS THE DECORATION ON THE BASE 
WHICH IS SORT OF BROWNS AND BLUES ALMOST 
AND I WONDER WHETHER THIS IS PERHAPS AN EARLY EXPERIMENTAL PIECE 
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT UNIFORM ALL THE WAY ROUND HERE 
YOU CLEARLY DON'T COLLECT DOULTON ANY MORE I DON'T 
HAVE YOU MOVED ON TO OTHER COLLECTING SPHERES 
LLOYD LOOM LLOYD LOOM SAD ISN'T IT 
YOU NEED TO GET OUT MORE 
HOW THE HELL HAVE YOU GONE FROM THIS TO LLOYD LOOM

FANTASTIC THANK YOU FOR COMING IN 
PHILIP GREAT ESTIMATE I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THAT 
THIS IS SYON HOUSE NESTLING ON THE RIVER THAMES 
THE LONDON HOME OF THE PERCY FAMILY 
EARLS AND DUKES OF NORTHUMBERLAND FOR THE LAST FOUR HUNDRED YEARS 
ALL OF THOSE GENERATIONS 
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE HOUSE W. E. SEE TODAY 
A CULMINATION OF A SERIES OF CONVERSIONS 
TO THE ORIGINAL TUDOR MANSION 
BUT SIR HUGH SMITHSON THE FIRST DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND 
POSSIBLY HAD THE GREATEST IMPACT ON THE HOUSE 
INHERITING THE ESTATE IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY 
HE COMMISSIONED THE SCOTTISH ARCHITECT ROBERT ADAM TO REDESIGN THE INTERIORS 
INSTRUCTING HIM TO CREATE AN OPULENT PALACE 
OF GRECO ROMAN SPLENDOUR 
PRESUMABLY MONEY WAS NO OBJECT BECAUSE THE RESULTING DESIGNS 
ARE SOME OF THE MOST STRIKING NEO CLASSICAL DESIGNS 
YOU'LL FIND ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY 
JUST LOOK AT THIS YOUR EYES GRAVITATE UP TOWARDS THE HEAVENS 
IT'S MARVELLOUS IT'S SPLENDID IT'S SO HARD TO TAKE IT ALL IN 
YOUR EYES VYING FOR ATTENTION EVERY SURFACE IS COVERED 
JUST BACK FROM HIS GRAND TOUR OF ITALY 
ROBERT ADAM'S HEAD WAS FULL OF ALL THE GREEK AND ROMAN STATUES 
HE'D SEEN ON HIS TRAVELS 
BORROWING ALL THESE CLASSICAL SYMBOLS OF WEALTH POWER AND ANTIQUITY 
HE REPACKAGED THE WHOLE LOT FOR HIS CLIENT 
JOINING ME TO TAKE A LOOK AT ROBERT ADAM'S WORK HERE 
IS ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIAN CHRISTOPHER WOODWARD 
THANKS FOR JOINING US HELLO GOOD TO SEE YOU 
THIS HAS THE WOW FACTOR THIS ENTRANCE HALL 
WHAT'S AMAZING IS YOU WALK UP TO THIS JACOBEAN FACADE THIS ENGLISH EXTERIOR 
AND YOU STEP THROUGH THAT DOOR ANCIENT ROME WOW 
IT'S QUITE AUSTERE OUTSIDE 
BUT INSIDE IT'S JUST TRUE THEATRE 
TELL ME ABOUT THE OWNERS OF THE HOUSE 
IT'S THE FIRST DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND BUT HIS WIFE'S HOUSE AND HER MONEY 
SHE HAD A BROTHER WHO DIED ON THE GRAND TOUR THIS IS THE PERCY FAMILY 
SO THERE WERE NO MEN LEFT SHE MARRIED A YOUNG BARONET SIR HUGH SMITHSON 
AND THEY SPENT LAVISHLY THEY LIVED LAVISHLY 
THEY LIVED AND SPENT MORE GRANDLY THAN KING GEORGE THE THIRD AND HIS FAMILY 
HOW DID ROBERT ADAM GET THE COMMISSION 
ROBERT ADAM IS A GENIUS A BRILLIANT SCOTTISH ARCHITECT 
HE GOES TO ROME AND HE WRITES HOME I'LL BE WASTED ON SCOTLAND 
HE DECIDES TO CONQUER LONDON SO HE COMES BACK 
AND HE OPENS AN OFFICE IN MAYFAIR 
WITH A TEAM OF ITALIAN ARTISTS WHO WORK FOR HIM THAT HE BROUGHT BACK 
THERE'S SCULPTURE AND PAINTINGS ON THE WALLS AND HE HAS HIS SKETCHES OF ROME 
ON THAT JOURNEY HE PERSUADES YOU THAT HE BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE 
CAN CONJURE UP FOR YOU THE TRUE SPIRIT OF ROMAN ANTIQUITY 
HERE THEIR BRITISH ARCHITECT JAMES PAYNE HAS NEVER BEEN TO ROME 
AND THEY KICK HIM OFF AND GIVE ADAM THE JOB ADAM HAD A VISION 
YES SHALL WE GO ON A TOUR OF ADAM'S WORK THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE 
THIS IS THE ANTEROOM WOW GOSH IT'S A KALEIDOSCOPE OF COLOUR 
WHAT WAS THIS ROOM USED FOR 
THE DUKE IS A STATESMAN A MAN OF POWER 
THIS IS WHERE YOU WAITED TO SEE HIM 
SHUFFLING AROUND MAKING YOU FEEL VERY INSECURE 
IT DOES SHOW OFF HIS WEALTH 
WAS ANCIENT ROME AS BRIGHT AS THIS THAT'S WHAT ROBERT ADAM BELIEVED 
HE'S SAYING THIS IS HOW ROMAN ARCHITECTURE WAS THIS IS HOW THEY LIVED 
HE CREATED THIS GAUDY BRILLIANT INTERIOR 
THE STATUES OF ROMAN GODS AND GODDESSES ARE MODERN REPLICAS 
THEY'RE PLASTER COVERED IN GILDING 
WHAT I LOVE WHAT'S REAL IS THE COLUMNS 
BECAUSE ROMANS LOVED MARBLE 
THEY WERE CONNOISSEURS OF DIFFERENT COLOURS AND PATTERNS OF MARBLE 
THESE ARE SINGLE PIECES OF MARBLE QUARRIED IN EGYPT 
FLOATED DOWN THE NILE ACROSS THE SEA TO ROME WHERE THE BOAT SANK 
THEY WERE BURIED IN THE MUD OF THE TIBER FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
SOMEONE FOUND THEM AND THEY WERE BROUGHT TO SYON HOUSE 
SO THIS IS NOT JUST A HOUSE IMITATING ROME 
THESE COLUMNS ARE REAL ROMAN ARCHITECTURE 
WHY WAS THE FAMILY TRYING TO COPY THE ROMAN WAY OF LIFE WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE ROMANS 
BRITAIN SAW ITSELF AS THE NEW ROME 
THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTIES IS WHEN BRITAIN HAS BEATEN THE FRENCH IN THE SEVEN YEARS WAR 
THERE'S A FEEL GOOD FACTOR YES VERY CONFIDENT WE HAVE AN EMPIRE THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD 
IF YOU WERE AT SCHOOL IN THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTIES YOUR BOOKS WOULD TELL YOU 
YOU ARE THE ROMANS OF OLD THE HEIRS OF ANCIENT ROME LONDON IS THE NEW ROME 
IT REALLY IS SPLENDID SHALL WE SEE SOME MORE 
NEXT IS THE QUIETER DINING ROOM 
ANOTHER DEMONSTRATION OF ADAM'S SKILL 
IN EXPANDING A SMALL SPACE TO CREATE A LARGER ONE 
BY MEANS OF NICHES SCREENS AND PERSPECTIVE 
GOSH NOW THIS LOOKS ALTOGETHER A LOT MORE FEMININE 
YES THIS IS FOR THE WOMEN TO WITHDRAW TO AFTER DINNER 
LOOK AT THE CEILING 
IT'S ONE OF ADAM'S GREATEST CEILINGS IT COST OVER ONE THOUSAND 
IT'S STUCCO AND GILT AND PAINT IT'S THE DECADE AFTER THEY DISCOVERED POMPEII AND HERCULANEUM 
THEY'D DUG UP ROMAN HOUSES WITH ANCIENT WALL PAINTINGS 
THE DUKE HAS A BOOK OF WALL PAINTINGS FROM THESE DISCOVERIES 
HE CHOOSES SCENES HE WANTS COPIED AND THEY'RE PAINTED ON PAPER 
IN MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED LITTLE SCENES BY AN ITALIAN CIPRIANI 
WHO ADAM HAD BROUGHT BACK FROM ITALY 
WHAT A TALENTED ARTIST 
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE WOVEN SILK ON THE WALLS I LOVE THAT FADED LOOK 
IN ITS DAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY BRIGHT RED WAS THAT IMPORTED FROM FRANCE 
THE DUKE WANTED TO BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAR WITH THE FRENCH 
HE WANTED THE MOST FASHIONABLE SILK HANGINGS 
SO HE HAD WEAVERS IN SPITALFIELDS COPY IT FOR HIM 
GOSH REALLY WELL THEY'VE DONE A FINE JOB HAVEN'T THEY 
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THIS ROOM WITHOUT THE PICTURES 
AND ALSO IMAGINE IT BY CANDLELIGHT 
THIS WAS AN EVENING ROOM THE DUCHESS WAS FAMOUS FOR THE CANDLES SHE BURNED 
THE DUKE WAS VERY PROUD OF THOSE TWO PIER GLASSES 
THEY WERE MADE IN PARIS THEY COST MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED 
THEY WERE TWO OF THE BIGGEST MIRRORED GLASSES ANYONE HAD SEEN IN BRITAIN 
AND YOU HAD TO GET IT FROM FRANCE 
THEY ARE BIG 
ROBERT ADAM'S ABILITY IS TO DESIGN A ROOM 
KNOWING IT WILL BE LIT BY CANDLELIGHT 
WHAT YOU SEE IN THIS ROOM IS JUST HOW MUCH EXPENSE THEY'D GO TO TO GET EVERY DETAIL RIGHT 
WHEN YOU COME TO THE DOORWAY 
YOU HAVE THESE GILT AND ORMOLU DETAILS 
SET AGAINST PANELS OF IVORY THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS SPOT ON 
NOW THIS IS TYPICAL OF A TUDOR LONG GALLERY 
WHERE PEOPLE TOOK THEIR EXERCISE ON A RAINY DAY 
BUT HE'S TAKEN IT AND REMODELLED THE WHOLE THING 
HE'S CREATED A NEW CLASSICAL INTERIOR IN THE EXISTING SPACE 
WHAT I THINK IT SHOWS YOU ABOUT ADAM 
IS THAT HE DESIGNS EVERYTHING DOWN TO THE DOORKNOBS 
HE IS ONE OF THE FIRST ARCHITECTS TO DO THE HOUSE INTERIOR AND FURNITURE 
YOU GET THE WHOLE PACKAGE WITH HIM YES AND HE SHOWED HERE THAT 
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ROMAN INTERIORS DON'T THINK TEMPLES AND MONUMENTS 
HE'D LOOKED AT THESE BATHS AND PRIVATE HOUSES THEY'D DUG UP 
WITH THIS LIGHT GENTLE EASY GOING ORNAMENTATION EXACTLY 
WHAT YOU ALSO GET WITH ADAM IS A TEAM 
SO ONE ARTIST HE'D BROUGHT FROM ITALY PAINTED THE PORTRAITS I SEE 
THESE ARE ALL FAMILY PORTRAITS YES THE ANCESTRY OF THE PERCY FAMILY 
A SECOND ARTIST PAINTED SCENES OF ANCIENT ROME 
LANDSCAPES ARCHITECTURE 
AND A THIRD ARTIST MICHELANGELO PERGOLESI PAINTED THE WALLS 
WITH THESE DELICATE ARABESQUE PATTERNS HE SO LIKED 
THE DUKE WAS SO PLEASED WITH HIS WORK HE GAVE HIM A TWENTY TIP 
GOSH THAT WAS A LOT OF MONEY IN THOSE DAYS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHOWING ME AROUND 
IF ANYBODY WANTS ANY TIPS 
ON HOW TO MAKE THEIR HOUSE LOOK LIKE ROBERT ADAM'S THEY SHOULD VISIT SYON PARK THANK YOU 
IT'S TIME TO GET BACK TO THE VALUATION DAY 
AND SEE WHAT ITEMS OUR EXPERTS HAVE SET THEIR SIGHTS ON 
DAVID HAS CERTAINLY GOT SOMETHING BREWING 
CAROL WHO WAS THE IRISH MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY 
ALL MY FAMILY ALL YOUR FAMILY'S IRISH YES 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT AN IRISH ACCENT I WAS BORN OVER HERE 
BUT ALL MY FAMILY ARE IRISH AND THAT'S WHERE THIS CAME FROM 
THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS IS BELLEEK PORCELAIN 
WHICH WAS PRODUCED IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN FERMANAGH 
HOW DID YOU ACQUIRE IT HAS IT BEEN PASSED DOWN 
IT BELONGED TO MY AUNT AND SHE LEFT IT TO ME 
SHE WAS A SINGLE LADY SO HAD NO CHILDREN OF HER OWN 
UM THE STORY IS THAT IT WAS GIVEN TO HER WHEN SHE WAS A YOUNG GIRL 
THIS IS WHAT WE TERM FIRST PERIOD BELLEEK 
THE FACTORY WAS ESTABLISHED BY DAVID MCBIRNEY AND ROBERT ARMSTRONG 
WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR 
THE FACTORY WAS ESTABLISHED ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN 
SO THE FIRST PERIOD IS BEFORE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY 
I'M GOING TO PUT THIS AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY 
REALLY NOW WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS 
IS THE NORTHERN IRELAND ASSOCIATION WITH THE SEA 
SO HERE IS THIS WONDERFUL TEAPOT WHICH IS IN THE FORM OF AN URCHIN 
SO WE'VE GOT THIS LOVELY SORT OF BULBOUS SHAPE 
WITH THE MARKINGS OF AN URCHIN SHELL 
THEN THE ACTUAL HANDLE IS THE FALL OF CORAL 
EVEN THE SPOUT HAS CORAL DECORATION ON IT 
NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT BELLEEK 
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A FINE PORCELAIN YOU LOOK FOR DAMAGE 
INEVITABLY PIECES GET DAMAGED 
THEY'RE QUITE FAMOUS FOR THOSE DELICATE BASKETS YES 
IT'S DIFFICULT LIFTING THAT OUT BECAUSE OF THE SMOOTH GLAZE 
LOOKING AT THIS LITTLE FINIAL IN THE FORM OF A SHELL 
IT'S SLIGHTLY DAMAGED THERE 
I DON'T THINK THAT WILL GO AGAINST IT TOO MUCH 
WE'LL TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT 
I'LL LEAVE THAT THERE AND TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN TO LOOK AT THE MARK 
THE MARK IS SOMEWHAT RUBBED 
SEE THAT WITH BELLEEK UNDERNEATH 
THAT'S THE MARK FOR EARLY BELLEEK 
COUNT OF FERMANAGH WOULD BE LATER 
RIGHT THIS IS A BLACK TRADEMARK SO IT'S QUITE AN EARLY PIECE 
SO CAROL WHY ARE YOU SELLING IT NO ONE IN THE FAMILY WANTS IT 
I'VE GOT TWO SONS BUT THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN HAVING IT 
SO IF SOMEBODY WOULD LIKE IT WHO COLLECTS AND WOULD APPRECIATE IT 
LIKE THAT 
WELL THIS IS A NICE COLLECTOR'S PIECE 
BUT IT'S SO VERY FINE AND SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE 
BEARING THAT IN MIND AND THAT ELEMENT OF DAMAGE 
WE'VE GOT TO FIX A PRICE 
I THINK THE AUCTIONEER WILL PROBABLY SAY 
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED FORTY AND THREE HUNDRED THAT SORT OF PRICE RANGE 
ALLOWING FOR THE DAMAGE WE'VE GOT TO TUCK IN UNDER THAT FIGURE 
SO I THINK WE'LL BE SEEKING A RESERVE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
RIGHT HOW DOES THAT SOUND YES 
I'LL BE QUITE HAPPY WITH THAT YES 
THERE'S A SLIGHT HESITATION WE ALL LIKE TO THINK IT'LL BE MORE VALUABLE THAT'S TRUE 
PETER WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME 
NOT MUCH I FOUND IT IN MY MOTHER'S HOUSE WHEN I WAS CLEARING IT OUT 
TILL THEN I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT EXISTED 
LET'S LOOK AT THE OBVIOUS THINGS FIRST 
IT'S GOT RECESSED HANDLES EITHER SIDE WHICH PULL OUT 
WHEN THEY'RE RECESSED IT MAKES YOU THINK IT'S A TRAVELLING CASE 
AS OPPOSED TO A BOX THAT WOULD SIT ON A SIDE TABLE 
SO IT'S A TRAVELLING BOX IT'S VICTORIAN 
COROMANDEL OR CALAMANDER WOOD 
IT'S GOT CUT BRASS INLAY HERE 
AND HERE'S A NAME PLATE FOR LADY DICKENSON 
WHEN WE OPEN IT UP WHAT DO WE FIND OPEN IT UP 
WOW LOOK AT THAT ISN'T THAT LOVELY 
SO THIS THEN FALLS FORWARD THERE'S A STATIONERY POUCH BEHIND THAT 
YOU CAN SEE HERE WHERE THE STATIONERY DROPS IN 
WE'LL TAKE ONE OF THESE OUT 
IT'S A LITTLE GLASS PERHAPS SOAP CONTAINER THERE 
YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE HALLMARKS ON THE INSIDE OF THE LID 
THEY DATE TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY TWO 
VICTORIA CAME TO THE THRONE IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN 
SO SHE'D BEEN AROUND FOR WHAT 
FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS BY THE TIME THIS WAS MADE 
IF WE NOW DROP THE FLAP DOWN 
YOU CAN SEE AGAIN RECESSED HINGES 
ONE MIGHT BE A JEWELLERY DRAWER 
ONE MIGHT HAVE A WRITING SLOPE IN IT LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
SO THERE WE ARE 
A LITTLE JEWELLERY BOX OR JEWELLERY DRAWER 
AND ANOTHER ONE WITH A LIFT OUT TRAY 
I THINK IT'S A LOVELY THING 
PUSH THAT DOWN VALUE WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH 
I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA WELL 
THERE ARE MINOR PROBLEMS 
THERE ARE SOME SCRATCHES HERE 
WHICH A GOOD CABINET MAKER CAN SORT OUT 
BUT YOU HAVE GOT A FAIRLY HEALTHY SPLIT ALONG THE TOP 
BUT IT'S A GOOD QUALITY BOX 
I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT AT AUCTION AT TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED 
AS MUCH AS THAT YEAH 
I'D PUT A RESERVE ON IT OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY I THINK IT'LL DO WELL 
WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE FUNDS 
AS I SAY MY MOTHER DIED ABOUT FIVE WEEKS AGO 
AND I WANT TO GET A MEMORIAL TO PUT AT THE CREMATORIUM FOR HER 
THAT'S GOING TO GO TO A REALLY GOOD CAUSE I HOPE IT DOES REALLY WELL 
THANKS FOR BRINGING IT NO PROBLEM 
BABS HOW MANY YEARS AGO DID YOU BUY THIS THIRTY YEARS AGO THIRTY YEARS 
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED THIRTY YEARS THIRTY THREE YEARS YES 
WAS IT A WEDDING PRESENT A LATE ONE 
SORT OF ONE TREATED OURSELVES YES VERY NICE 
DID YOU ACTUALLY GO TO THE TROIKA SHOP YES AT SAINT IVES 
YES SAINT IVES DOWN THE LITTLE STREET AND WHAT WAS IT LIKE 
OH I REMEMBER THERE WAS A WINDOW 
AND A LOT OF GLASS AND OTHER THINGS SHELVES AND THINGS AROUND 
SO VERY ARTS AND CRAFTS 
THIS IS QUITE AN INTERESTING POT BECAUSE THIS IS LATER IN DESIGN 
THAN THE MAJOR IMPACT WHICH WAS LATE FIFTIES INTO THE SIXTIES 
THE MAJOR INSPIRATION FOR TROIKA POTTERY 
WAS THE ARTISTS THAT GATHERED AT SAINT IVES 
PEOPLE LIKE BARBARA HEPWORTH BEN NICHOLSON 
THEY GAVE A SORT OF IMPACT TO THE EARLY DESIGNS 
THAT BENNY SIROTA WHO STARTED THE FACTORY PRODUCED 
THIS IS LATER 
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THIS IS A CONTRIVED DESIGN 
TO LOOK MODERN WHEREAS THE OTHER ONES WERE ALMOST ACCIDENTAL 
OH EVEN THE GLAZES ARE MORE CONTROLLED ON THIS ONE 
THAN THE EARLIER 
SO THIS IS AN OBJECT THAT I DON'T THINK WAS INTENDED TO HOLD FLOWERS 
THIS WAS ALWAYS INTENDED AS AN OBJECT TO ADMIRE 
HANDLE BUT NOT NECESSARILY IN A UTILITARIAN MANNER RIGHT 
IT'S VERY NICE HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY 
I THINK IT WAS ABOUT EIGHT POUNDS ABOUT EIGHT POUNDS 
WELL THAT WAS A GOOD INVESTMENT ACTUALLY 
IF THIS GOES UP FOR AUCTION WE'RE LOOKING AT ROUND ABOUT SIXTY EIGHTY 
OH MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE REALLY SO QUITE A GOOD INVESTMENT 
SO IT'S THE IMPACT DESIGN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS YOU THINK SIXTIES SEVENTIES 
MY ERA YOUR ERA WHAT ELSE CAN YOU ASSOCIATE WITH THAT ERA 
MUSIC WHAT WAS THE MUSIC OF THE TIME 
LIVELY MUCH BETTER THAN IT IS TODAY 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I'M OF THE SAME GENERATION ANYWAY YEAH 
SO WE CAN PUT THIS UP FOR SALE CAN WE YES CERTAINLY 
NO REGRETS NO NOT NOW HUSBAND AGREED TO IT OH YEAH O. K. 
I HOPE WE'LL GET THAT SORT OF MONEY ANY IDEAS WHAT TO REPLACE IT WITH 
I DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT YET 
JUST SPEND IT ON SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE TOWARDS A T. V. A HI TECH ONE 
TO HANG ON THE WALL GET IT BEFORE THIS PROGRAMME GOES OUT YES 
A FAMILIAR MIX OF LOTS FOR OUR FINAL SECTION OF TODAY'S AUCTION 
CAROL'S BELLEEK TEAPOT IS A FINE EXAMPLE BUT THERE'S SOME DAMAGE 
PETER'S VANITY BOX IS A BIT TIRED THEY USED TO MAKE GREAT MONEY 
AND FINALLY BARBARA'S BROUGHT IN AN OLD FRIEND TROIKA 
BUT THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES AT AUCTION 
IT'S TIME FOR TEA BUT DON'T GO AND PUT THE KETTLE ON 
WE HAVE A TEAPOT UP FOR GRABS IT BELONGS TO CAROL 
THIS IS LOVELY AN URCHIN TEAPOT WHICH DAVID PUT A VALUATION ON 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY HOPEFULLY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
IT'S GOT THE QUALITY IT'S GOT THE LOOK 
IT'S SO EARLY THE EARLY STAMP I LOVE THE WAY THEY FEATURE THE SEA 
YES ALL THE CREATURES THE URCHIN IS A VERY EARLY SHAPE GORGEOUS 
SOMETHING FOR BELLEEK COLLECTORS AND FOR TEAPOT COLLECTORS 
YOU HEARD WHAT DAVID SAID I THINK IT'LL DO ITS MONEY I'M WITH DAVID 
I CHATTED WITH THE AUCTIONEER EARLIER HE SAID IT MIGHT STRUGGLE 
WELL IT MIGHT JUST GET THE BOTTOM END 
FINGERS CROSSED THOUGH WE'RE HERE TO PROVE HIM WRONG 
WE WANT THE TOP END DON'T WE YES THAT WOULD BE NICE 
WHY FLOG IT WELL IT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY A LONG TIME 
BUT MY SONS AREN'T INTERESTED IN IT I SUPPOSE NOT 
IF SOMEBODY THAT COLLECTS LIKES IT IT'S A FAMILY HEIRLOOM 
IT'S A SHAME 
THE BELLEEK TEAPOT START ME PLEASE FOR ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED FOR IT 
I'LL TAKE ONE HUNDRED TEN ONE HUNDRED I'M BID I'LL TAKE ONE HUNDRED TEN WHO'LL GIVE ME ONE HUNDRED TEN

I THINK IT'S A LUCKY OMEN YOU'VE HAD IT A LONG TIME I DO MISS IT 
I MISS LOOKING AT IT THERE YOU GO 
I'LL TAKE IT HOME I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED IT WAS A DAY OUT 
OR TRY IT IN A SPECIALIST CERAMIC SALE THAT'S THE ANSWER
