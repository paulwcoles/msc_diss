THIS IS B. B. C. WORLD NEWS TODAY 
VOTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA HAVE BEEN 
GOING TO THE POLLS ALL DAY AS THE 
U. S. DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY WHICH IS SEEN 
AS HILLARY CLINTON'S LAST CHANCE TO 
REVIVE HER BID FOR THE WHITE HOUSE 
AGAINST BARACK OBAMA WHAT MUST SHE 
DO TO WRESTLE FRONTRUNNER STATUS 
FROM HIM 
BRITAIN WARNS THE FOOD CRISIS IS 
THREATENING GLOBAL STABILITY AS 
THEY URGE FOR ACTION 
WE ASK THE AMBASSADOR FOR WHAT HE 
WANTS TO BE DONE THE COALITION 
SPECIAL FORCES STEP IN TO HELP IN 
IRAQ IS THE IRAQI ARMY UP TO 
SCRATCH MEET BEATRICE 
I'M AN 
ARCHAEOLOGIST I'VE REACHED THE 
STAGGERING AGE OF NINETY THREE 
THE RELIC 
HUNTER FOR LONDON WITH A GOOD CHUNK 
OF HISTORY UNDER HER BELT 
HELLO AND WELCOME 
THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA IS NOT SO 
ACCUSTOMED TO BEING IN THE 
SPOTLIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO A 
AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE BUT THE 
TIGHT AND TOUGH CONTEST BETWEEN THE 
DEMOCRATIC RIVALS CLINTON AND 
OBAMA HAS MADE THIS A CRUCIAL 
BATTLE IN THE CAMPAIGN 
SENATOR CLINTON IS TRAILING IN THE 
OVERALL TOTAL DELEGATES STAKES 
HOWEVER BOTH CANDIDATES ARE SOME 
WAY FROM SECURING THE TWO THOUSAND NEED 
TODAY SECURE THE DEMOCRATIC 
NOMINATION WITH ONE EIGHTY SEVEN DELEGATES UP 
FOR GRABS MRS. CLINTON NEEDS TO WIN 
BIG TO STAY IN THE RACE SHE IS 
AFTER ALL ON HER HOME TURF HER 
GRANDPARENTS COME FROM THE STATE 
THIS INDUSTRIAL SKYLINE HELPS 
EXPLAIN WHY HILLARY CLINTON HOPES 
TO WIN IN PENNSYLVANIA WORKING 
CLASS VOTERS HAVE BEEN THE BACKBONE 
OF HER CAMPAIGN PENNSYLVANIA'S 
CHANGING AND THIS STATE IS NOW THE 
FIGHT OF THE OLD STYLE POLITICS 
AGAINST SOMETHING NEW IN TOWNS 
LIKE BETHLEHEM THE OLD 
IT'S 
REPLACED BY NEW INVESTMENT AND NEW 
INDUSTRY YOU CAN SEE THAT CONTRAST 
IN THE SHARP DIVIDE AMONG THE 
VOTERS TOO 
THEY ALL WORKED HERE 
MOST OF OUR CITY WORKED HERE 
DONE'S FATHER USED TO WORK IN THE 
STEEL MILL IT IS NOW REDUNDANT BUT 
HE BELIEVES HILLARY CLINTON'S 
APPEAL ENDURES 
THE COMMON SENSE WISDOM OF THE 
WORKING PERSON THEY UNDERSTAND 
THAT SOMETIMES IT TAKES YEARS OF 
SEASONING AND YEARS OF EXPERIENCE 
AND THAT IT IS NOT JUST AS EASY AS 
MAKING A SPEECH TO GET THINGS DONE 
THAT YOU HAVE TO BATTLE THINGS 
THROUGH THE TRENCHES 
IT IS THE TOUGHEST JOB IN THE 
WORLD 
EXACTLY THE SENTIMENT WORLD HILLARY CLINTON'S BEEN EMPHASISING 
HER LATEST AD USING IMAGES OF PEARL 
HARBOR AND OSAMA BIN LADEN TO 
SUGGEST ONLY SHE COULD WITHSTAND 
THE PRESSURES OF OFFICE 
WHO DO YOU 
THINK HAS WHAT IT TAKES WHILE WHILE BARACK OBAMA'S RELYING ON HIS 
MESSAGE OF CHANGE HE'S STILL 
RESORTING TO NEGATIVE ADVERTS 
BUT AMONG PENNSYLVANIA'S YOUNG 
PROFESSIONALS LIKE THIS LECTURER 
WHO REPRESENTS A BREAK WITH THE 
PAST 
HIS IDEA OF CHANGE AND HIS PAST CAMPAIGN ON CHANGE HAS GIVEN SOME 
POWER BACK TO YOUNGER GENERATIONS 
AND I THINK THAT'S NOT BEEN THERE 
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BUT BUT THIS CONTEST HAS BECOME 
INCREASINGLY VICIOUS 
ON A PRIME TIME T. V. WRESTLING SHOW 
ANIMATED VERSIONS OF THE TWO CANNED 
CATS BATTLE IT OUT IN THE RING THE 
REALITY HASN'T COME TO THAT BUT 
FOR HILLARY CLINTON SHE NEEDS A 
CONVINCING WIN JUST TO STAY IN THE 
RACE WE CAN GO LIVE TO OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IN PHILADELPHIA 
MATTHEW SO IT IS A BIG STATE 
HILLARY CLINTON'S BEEN TOPPING THE 
POLLS CONSISTENTLY BUT IT IS A BIT 
PATCHY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE 
ACROSS THE WHOLE OF PENNSYLVANIA 
ISN'T IT 
WELL THIS STATE IS A VERY 
VARIED STATE AND IN PARTS OF IT 
YOU'VE GOT A VERY LARGE RURAL 
WORKING CLASS ELDERLY POPULATION IN 
OTHER PARTS PLACES LIKE THIS CITY 
THAT I'M STANDING IN PENNSYLVANIA 
FILL DELFEEA YOU HAVE AN URBAN 
POPULATION AND POPULATION THAT'S 
MORE LIKELY OR SEEN AS MORE LIKELY 
TO VOTE FOR OBAMA YOU HAVE A 
WIDESPREAD OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE 
STATE PERHAPS MORE SO THAN THE 
OTHER STATES WE'VE HELD PRIMARIES 
IN YOU MENTIONED HILLARY CLINTON'S 
LEAD LEAD SHE HAS INDEED HAD A LEAD IN THE 
POLLS SINCE POLLING STARTED IN 
PENNSYLVANIA AND TO DO WITH THIS 
PARTICULAR PRIMARY CONTEST BUT 
THAT LEAD IT APPEARS ACCORDING TO 
THE POLLS IS SLIPPING AND BARACK 
OBAMA BELIEVES HE'S KNOCKED TO DOWN 
INTO SINGLE FIGURES WE'LL HAVE TO 
SEE WHAT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE 
VOTE IS TONIGHT IF AS MOST PEOPLE 
ASSUME HILLARY CLINTON WINS THE 
THING WE SHOULD BE FOCUSINGEN A IS 
HOW MUCH DOES SHE WIN BY MATTHEW MATTHEW WITH ALL THESE DELEGATES BEING SO 
IMPORTANT IS THE SYSTEM IN 
PENNSYLVANIA A WINNER TAKES ALL 
SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE DELEGATES 
OR IS IT A PROPORTIONAL 
REPRESENTATION ONE THAT THEY ARE 
DIVIDED BETWEEN THE TWO IT'S IT'S PROPORTIONAL THAT'S HOW THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE DIVIDED UP THEIR 
DELEGATES AS THEY'VE GONE THROUGH 
THE CONTEST THAT'S CRUCIAL IF YOU 
REMEMBER WHEN JOHN MCCAIN WON HIS 
PARTY'S NOMINATION ALL THOSE WEEKS 
AGO THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH BECAUSE 
THE REPUBLICAN SYSTEM IS BASED ON 
WINNER TAKES ALL HE WAS WINNING 
MAYBE BY A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 
THE STATES AND YET HE WAS TAKING 
LARGE NUMBERS OF DELEGATES IT IS 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT DELEGATES AT STAKE HERE IN 
PENNSYLVANIA THOSE WILL BE DIVIDED 
BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE ON THE VOTE 
EACH CANDIDATES GETS THAT'S WHY IT 
IS PROVING SO DIFFICULT FOR HILLARY 
CLINTON TO EAT INTO BARACK OBAMA'S 
LEAD O. K. IT IS NOT A MASSIVE LEAD 
BUT THAT'S WHY IT IS PROVING SO 
DIFFICULT TO EAT INTO HIS DELEGATE 
LEAD BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING FROM 
STATE TO STATE HE IS PICKING UP A 
FEW POINTS HERE AND SHE'S PICKING 
UP A FEW POINTS THERE BUT THE 
OVERALL COUNT ISN'T CHANGING 
THAT'S WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY 
HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS MASSIVE 
VICTORIES IN THIS STATE AND IN THE 
COMING WEEKS IN THE OTHER PRIMARIES 
TO EAT INTO BARACK OBAMA'S LEAD IF 
SHE CAN'T SHE'LL PROBABLY NOT BE 
ABLE TO GET THE NOMINATION 
THANK YOU NOW WORLD GOVERNMENTS 
AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES ARE 
BEING SOUNDING THE ALARM BELLS FOR 
SOME TIME NOW HOWARD THE HIGH PRICE 
OF FOOD CROPS ARE THREATENING MORE 
FAMILIES WITH HUNGER NOW THEY'RE 
CRANKING UP THE VOLUME AT A MAJOR 
GATHERING IN LONDON TO HELP TACKLE 
THE CHALLENGES THE ENGLISH 
GOVERNMENT IS SAYING THAT THE 
HUNGER WORLDWIDE IS THREATENING 
SECURITY AND URGENT ACTION IS 
NEEDED NEEDED THE WORLD IS FACING ITS BIGGEST 
FOOD CRISIS FOR A GENERATION 
TRIGGERED BY PRICES THAT HAVE 
SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL 
FOR THE RICH IT IS AIN CONVENIENCE 
BUT FOR THE POOR IT SPELLS DISASTER 
THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME FEEDS SEVENTY 
MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD IT 
NOW HIT A BUDGET SHORTFALL OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS 
MILLION PROJECTS LIKE THESE ARE AT 
RISK OF BEING CUT 
THIS CRISIS 
WE'RE FACE SOMETHING UNIQUE IT IS 
WHAT I CALL A SILENT TSUNAMI IT IS 
NOT ONE STORM HITING IN ONE PLACE 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT KNOWS NO 
BORDERS AND ROLLING THROUGH THE 
WORLD AND INCREASING THE MISERY OF 
THE WORLD'S MOST VULNERABLE 
THERE'S TALK OF A NEW FACE OF 
HUNGER TWENTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE HERE IN 
AFGHANISTAN WHO ARE NOT AT RISK 
BEFORE NOW ENTERING THE RANKS OF 
THE VERY HUNGRY 
THE CAUSES A LETHAL COMBINATION OF 
HIGH FUEL PRICES BAD WEATHER 
WEATHER IN CROP GROWING AREAS 
INCREASED DEMAND FROM CHINA AND 
INDIA HORDING AND EXPORT CONTROLS 
AS COUNTRIES PRESERVE FOOD FOR 
THEIR OWN PEOPLE MONEY IS NEEDED 
IN THE SHORT TERM BUT ALSO IN THE 
LONG TERM BOOST TO AGO CULTURE 
BIOFUELS TOO HAVE PLAYED THEIR PART 
IN DIMINISHING THE FOOD SUPPLY BOW 
LIVIAN PRESIDENT BLAMED THEM FOR 
GLOBAL HUNGER COUNTRIES ARE 
RECOGNISING THIS EMERGENCY AND 
THERE'S OPTIMISM THAT INTERNATIONAL 
AGENCIES ARE PULLING TOGETHER TO 
TRY AND SOLVE IT BUT TODAY'S 
MEETING IN DOWNING STREET THE 
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER GORDON 
BROWN CALLED FOR AN URGENT PLAN OF 
ACTION INCLUDING A GLOBAL REVIEW 
OF BIOFUELS POLICY MR. BROWN SAID 
RISING FOOD PRICES POSED AS GREAT A 
THREAT TO WORLD PROSPERITY AS THE 
GLOBAL CREDIT CRISIS AND WARNED 
THEY THREATEN TO REVERSE PROGRESS 
TO ALLEVIATE POVERTY IN THE THIRD 
WORLD THE BIG LESSEN SAYS THE 
WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME IS TO REMIND 
PEOPLE THAT FOOD DOESN'T APPEAR ON 
SUPERMARKET SHELVES BY MAGIC IF 
MILLIONS OF THE POOREST IS TO STAVE 
OFF HUNGER THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE 
INVESTMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION IT 
IS NOT GLAMOROUS BUT IT IS VITAL 
WELL MANY AFFECTED COUNTRIES LIKE 
ETHIOPIA HAS SOME KIND OF FOOD 
SUBSIDY POLICY IN PLACE AS THE 
COST OF THE SUBS KISS BECOMES MORE 
EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN THE 
ETHIOPIANS HAVE INTRODUCED A NOVEL 
INITIATIVE THIS MONTH THEY OPENED 
A COMMODITY EXCHANGE THE FIRST IN 
AFRICA FOR CROPS LIKE MAIZE AND 
WHEAT EIGHT JOINING US HERE TO 
DISCUSS THIS IS THE ETHIOPIAN 
AMBASSADOR BERHANU KEBEDE TELL US 
WHAT IMPACT HAS THE FOOD CRISIS 
HAD ON ETHIOPIA IT IS THE COUNTRY 
THAT PEOPLE ASSOCIATE WITH 
INSECURITY 
GENERALLY THE YOU ARE INSECURITY BEGAN POOR IS AFFECTED BY THE RISE 
OF FOOD PRICES THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
COME UP WITH A PROGRAMME TO ADDRESS 
THE FOOD SHORTAGES IN THE URBAN 
AREAS IT SUBSIDISED TO THE TUNE OF 
FOUR POINT TWO BILLION I. B. R. 
WHAT'S THAT IN 
DOLLARS 
JUST DIVIDE IT BY NINE DOLLARS AND APPROXIMATELY NINE TO EIGHT 
EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT NOW THE 
INTERVENTION BY THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
BROUGHT SOME RESULTS AND FOOD 
PRICES GOING DOWN BUT A LOT OF 
WORK HAS TO BE DONE SO THE FOOD 
SHORTAGE IN THE URBAN AREA CAN BE 
DIVIDED INTO THE SUBSIDIES SHORT 
TERM APPROACH THE SECOND IS LONG 
TERM APPROACH THROUGH ENHAENSING 
PRODUCTIVITY SO THAT FOOD CAN BE 
AVAILABLE IN THE URBAN AREAS AND 
ALSO BY CREATING EMPLOYMENT IN THE 
URBAN AREAS IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC 
LIVILIHOOD OF THE PEOPLE IN THE 
URBAN AREAS THEY DECIDED TO 
APPROACH THIS 
IS ETHIOPIA 
CUSHIONED FROM THE IMPACT OF THE 
FULL SHOCK BECAUSE IT RELIES A 
GREAT DEAL ON FOOD AID 
THE URBAN 
POOR ARE AFFECTED BY THE RISE OF 
THE FOOD PRICES THAT'S WHY THE 
GOVERNMENT 
THE VERY POOR AREN'T GOVERNMENT BECAUSE YOU STILL GET A LOT OF FOOD 
AID 
RURAL POOR THE 
IN THE RURAL AID THE AREAS THERE'S A CHAIN OF PATTERN 
THE RURAL AREAS THE PEOPLE ARE 
GETTING BETTER INCOME BETTER 
PRODUCTIVITY FROM THE SMALLER 
CULTURAL HOLDING THE PROBLEM IS IN 
THE URBAN POOR NOT RURAL AREAS 
THIS COMMODITY EXCHANGE THAT HAS 
JUST BEEN ESTABLISHED SURELY 
THAT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING MONEY ISN'T 
IT 
IT IS NOT ABOUT MAKING MONEY IT IT IS JUSTICE IF I CAN SAY IT IS 
A MATTER OF ASSISTING THE FARMERS 
TO FAIR PRICE FOR THEIR PRODUCT AT 
THE SAME TIME IT IS A GIVING 
PRODUCE TO THE URBAN CONSUMERS AT A 
REASONABLE PRICE THIS WILL HELP 
WITH THE COUNTRY IN GENERAL IN 
TERMS OF EARNING BENEFITING FROM 
ITS AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMME BECAUSE 
OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME IS 
CENTRED ON AGO CULTURE SO IT'S ONE 
OF THE MECHANISMS OF ENHANCING THE 
COUNTRY'S REVOLUTION THROUGH THE 
MECHANISM 
IT IS ALL INTERNAL AT MECHANISM THE MOMENT 
OF COURSE IT WILL HELP 
IN TERMS OF ADVISING FARMERS TO 
BENEFIT FROM EXPORT PRICES ALSO IT 
ENCOURAGES IT IT HAS ITS DATA BASE 
WAS IN CONSUMERS 
I WAS GOING TO 
ASK YOU ABOUT EXPORT WHERE DO YOU 
STAND ON BIOFUELS WE HAD TWO 
PRESIDENTS SAYING IT IS MAKING 
MATTERS WORSE DO YOU SEE THIS AS 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPORT CROPS 
SOME COMPANIES ARE ENGAGED IN 
FARMING AND THIS IS A LIMITED AND 
NOT CURRENTLY A PROBLEM IN EETHYOPA 
SECONDLY OUR ENERGY SOURCES MORE 
OR ELSE WE ARE HEADING ON A POWER 
IT IS AN OWNER OF TRAPT AND IN THE 
PROCESS OF MAKING MAJOR DUMPS 
ALTHOUGH IT IS MAKING THE CAPACITY 
OF ELECTRICITY 
YOU DON'T WORRY 
ABOUT THE BIOFUEL GLOBAL POLICY 
ROBBING PEOPLE OF FOOD 
IT GIVES 
PRICE RISES GLOBALLY N. AGO CULTURE 
PRODUCTS OF COURSE IT WOULD HAVE 
AN IMPACT BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE AN 
IMMEDIATE IMPACT IN EETHYOPA THANK THANK YOU LET US TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
DAY'S OTHER NEWS THE SUDAN 
SENSORS COLLECTORS ARE FANNING OUT 
FOR A POPULATION COUNT THAT IS A 
REQUIREMENT OF A TWO THOUSAND FIVE AGREEMENT IT 
IS SET TO PAVE FOR NEXT YEAR'S 
ELECTION AND DETERMINATION HOW OIL 
REVENUE IS DIRECTED SOMALI TROOPS 
STORMED A SHIP THAT WAS HIJACKED BY 
PIRATES OFF THE HORN OF AFRICA 
RELEASING THE CREW AND ARRESTING 
SEVEN PIRATES THE SOMALI 
AUTHORITIES LEDGED TO DO THE SAME 
TO RESCUE A SPANISH SHIP HELD BY 
PIRATES SINCE THE WEEKEND 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH HAS BEEN ON 
PARADE IN JAKARTA THE TORCH 
COMPLETED FIVE LAPS OF THE NATIONAL 
STADIUM SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF 
SECURITY PERSONNEL AND WATCHED BY 
AN INVITED AUDIENCE OUTSIDE THE 
STADIUM THERE WAS A SMALL PRO TIBET 
DEMONSTRATION DEMONSTRATION BRITAIN'S SECOND BIGGEST BANK IS 
ASKING SHAREHOLDERS FOR TWELVE BILLION 
THAT'S AROUND TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SO IT HAS 
ENOUGH CAPITAL TO SUPPORT THE PLANS 
THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND 
SUSTAINED HEAVY LOSSES OF ASSETS 
LINKED TO THE AMERICAN HOME LOANS 
MARKET 
THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT HAS SET ITSELF 
THE OBJECTIVE OF DISARMING SHIA 
MILITIA WHO UNDERMINE ITS AUTHORITY 
IRAQI FORCES HAVE BEEN SPEARHEADING 
EFFORTS AGAINST FORCES IN BAGHDAD 
AND BASRA BUT THIS HAS NOT PROVED 
EASY THE B. B. C. HAS LEARNED THAT THE 
MILITARY OPERATION HAS NOW BEEN 
STEPPED UP WITH BRITISH AND 
AMERICAN SPECIAL FORCES INVOLVED IN 
RAIDS ANALYSTS BELIEVE THIS 
SUGGESTS THAT IRAQI FORCES MAY NOT 
BE AS WELL EQUIPPED FOR THE TASK AS 
MIGHT BE UP 
AS MIGHT BE HOPED 
THE BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF BASRA 
HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE 
PAST MONTH AND STILL THE FIGHTING 
GOES ON NOW IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED 
THAT BRITISH AND AMERICAN SPECIAL 
FORCES HAVE ENTERED THE FRAY THEIR 
OBJECTIVE TO DETAIN A SO CALLED 
HIGH VALUE TARGETS KEY LEADERS OF 
LOCAL MILITIA IN PARTICULAR THE 
MEHDI ARMY THE FOR INVOLVEMENT IS 
TACIT ACCEPTANCE THAT THE IRAQI 
MILITARY WAS STRUGGLING PRIME PRIME MINISTER NOURI AL MALIKI TO HAVE 
BEGUN FOR POLITICAL REASONS AND 
SAID WE WILL DO IT NOW IT IS MY 
SHOW AND NOT CONSULTING WITH 
ANYBODY HE DID IT BEFORE HIS 
FORCES WERE READY HE GOT INTO 
DIFFICULTY AND SO ABOUT THE 
COALITION FORCES ARE HAVING TO TRY 
TO DIG HIM OUT WITHOUT THEMSELVES 
GETTING TOO EMBROILED IN WHAT COULD 
BECOME A CIVIL LAW 
IT WAS ONLY LAST DECEMBER THAT 
BRITISH TROOPS IN BASRA HANDED OVER 
TO IRAQI SECURITY FORCES FROM NOW 
ON IRAQIS WOULD TAKE THE LEAD AND 
LAST MONTH THEY DID HEADING UP A 
MAJOR GOVERNMENT OFFENSIVE THE 
BRITISH AND INCREASINGLY AMERICAN 
MILITARY PROVIDING A CRUCIAL BUT 
SUPPORTIVE ROLE THE STATED AIM WAS 
TO DISARM THE MEHDI ARMY A SHIA 
MILITIA LOYAL TO MUQTADA AL SADR 
HE HAS SIGNIFICANT POPULAR SUPPORT 
AND THEREFORE REPRESENTS A 
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO THE 
AUTHORITY OF PRIME MINISTER NOURI 
AL MALIKI IN RECENT WEEKS THE 
FIGHTING HAS SPREAD FROM BASRA TO 
OTHER PARTS OF IRAQ INCLUDING THE 
SADR CITY DISTRICT OF BAGHDAD THE 
SITUATION IS COMPLICATED BY THE 
BACK BED SHIA MEMBERS OF THE IRAQI 
SECURITY FORCES ARE VERY RELUCTANT 
TO FIGHT THEIR KINSMEN SO MUCH SO 
THAT SOME HAVE DESERTED NOW THERE 
SEEMS TO BE A NEW PUSH WITH A BIG 
MOBILISATION OF AMERICAN TROOPS AND 
COALITION SOLDIERS MUCH MORE 
DIRECTLY INVOLVED SO WHERE MIGHT 
ALL THIS LEAD ONE THEORY IS THAT 
THE MEHDI ARMY HAS BEEN 
SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKENED ALREADY AND 
SO ONE MORE EFFORT COULD BE ENOUGH 
TO FINISH THE MILITIA AS AN 
EFFECTIVE FIGHTING FORCE BUT WOULD 
ALSO REDUCE THE POLITICAL INFLUENCE 
OF MUQTADA AL SADR 
I THINK THIS IS 
THE FIRST STAGE IN THE LAST BATTLE 
FOR THE CONTROL OF IRAQ THAT WHAT 
WE ARE NOW SEEING IS COMPETITION 
WITHIN THESE HERE IS COMMUNITY FOR 
WHO WILL DOMINATE THAT COMMUNITY IN 
IRAQ THE SHIA COMMUNITY THE 
MAJORITY COMMUNITY FOR THE NEXT FEW 
YEARS 
SO THERE IS MUCH AT STAKE YEARS AND THE FEAR FOR AMERICAN AND 
BRITISH TROOPS AS IF THE FIGHTING 
DRAGS ON SUCKING THEM INTO AN EVER 
MORE BITTER CIVIL CONFLICT 
WELL JOINING US NOW FROM 
WASHINGTON IS THOMAS DONNELLY FROM 
THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE 
FORMERLY AN ADVISER TO THE 
COMMITTEE ON OUR SERVICES IN THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DO YOU 
THINK THAT THE COALITION FORCES ARE 
DOING A GOOD JOB IN TACKLING THE 
MILITIAS 
WELL IN BASRA THE MILITIAS RECENT NEWS REPORTS SUGGEST THAT 
THEY HAVE ESSENTIALLY CLEARED THE 
CITY OVER THE WEEKEND THEY REDUCED 
WHAT WAS DESCRIBED AS THE SORT OF 
FINAL REDOUBT OF THE MEHDI ARMY IN 
BASRA SO THE OUTCOME AT LEAST 
SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AN EFFECTIVE ONE 
DOESN'T THE OPERATION AGAINST THE 
SHIA MILITIAS RUN THE RISK OF 
PROVOKING MUQTADA AL SADR WHO HAS 
BEEN OBSERVING A CEASEFIRE FOR THE 
MOST PART WE THINK THESE ARE THE 
MORE RENEGADE ELEMENTS AMONG HIS 
SUPPORTERS WHO HAVE BEEN PURSUING 
THE FIGHT ISN'T THAT GOING TO 
PROVOKE HIM INTO FURTHER ACTION 
AGAINST THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT 
WELL AS YOU SUGGEST THE MEHDI 
ARMY IS NOT REALLY A COHESIVE AND 
UNIFIED ORGANISATION THERE ARE 
RENEGADE ELEMENTS THAT ARE RUN BY A 
SPECIAL CELLS OR SPECIAL GROUPS AS 
THEY'RE CALLED IT HAS BEEN 
INTERESTING TO SEE NOT ONLY IN 
BASRA BUT AS THE IRAQI ARMY AND THE 
COALITION HAVE STEPPED UP THE 
PRESSURE ON SADR CITY REALLY HOW 
INEFFECTIVE THE RESPONSE FROM 
MUQTADA AL SADR HAS BEEN WE 
BELIEVE HE IS STILL IN IRAN SO HE 
DOES APPEAR AT THESE TO THE NEAR 
TERM TO HAVE LOST A LOT OF 
INFLUENCE OVER THE LAST MONTH WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE DOUBTS THAT SOME HAVE 
RAISED OVER THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 
THE IRAQI ARMY IN TACKLING THIS 
PROBLEM ALONE IT WAS SUGGESTED 
THEY CANNOT ACCOMPLISH VERY MUCH 
WITHOUT COALITION FORCES 
WE DO NOT 
REALLY KNOW THE DEGREE TO WHICH 
BRITISH AND AMERICAN ADVISERS OR 
UNITS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IT WOULD 
BE QUITE NORMAL FOR AMERICAN 
ADVISERS TO TRAVEL WITH THE IRAQI 
UNITS THAT WERE REDEPLOYED FROM 
BAGHDAD TO BASRA AND IT IS NOT 
UNLIKELY THAT SPECIAL FORCES WHO 
ALWAYS GO AFTER HIGH VALUE TARGETS 
WOULD ACTUALLY FOLLOW ONE AND 
EXPLOIT THE SUCCESS OF THE IRAQI 
ARMY SO ACTUALLY AGAIN UNTIL WE 
KNOW THE FULL STORY IT IS VERY 
DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT THE ROLE OF 
U. S. OR BRITISH FORCES HAS BEEN BUT 
AS A COALITION THE OUTCOME HAS BEEN 
ON THAT AS AT LEAST CLEARED BASRA 
FOR THE IMMEDIATE MOMENT THOMAS THOMAS DONNELLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
ONE MONTH FROM NOW THE VETERAN 
HOLLYWOOD ACTOR HARRISON FORD WILL 
BE BACK ON THE BIG SCREEN REVIVING 
HIS SIGNATURE ROLE AS THE FICTIONAL 
ARCHAEOLOGIST INDIANA JONES BUT 
HIS STAMINA HAS NOT GOT A PATCH ON 
ONE REAL VETERAN BRITISH 
ARCHAEOLOGIST BEATRICE DE CARDI 
WHO HAS BEEN TRAVELLING THE WORLD 
FOR DECADES IN QUEST OF HISTORIC 
ARTEFACTS AT THE AGE OF NINETY THREE SHE 
SHOWS NO SIGNS OF CHANGING PACE WE 
CAUGHT UP WITH HER FOR A CHAT ABOUT 
THE LIFE AND WORK 
I AM AN ARCHAEOLOGIST CALLED 
BEATRICE DE CARDI WHO WAS REACHED 
THE STAGGERING AGE OF NINETY THREE 
I HAVE LIVED IN LONDON ALL MY LIFE 
AND THAN NOWT TUCKED AWAY IN A 
SMALL FLAT IN KENSINGTON AND I 
AM NOW AS AN ARCHAEOLOGIST I HAVE 
WORKED IN PAKISTAN'S PARTICULARLY 
IN IRAN FROM WHERE I CROSSED TO 
THE ARAB SIDE OF THE GULF I NEVER 
MANAGED TO GET INTO SAUDI ARABIA 
BECAUSE 
I WAS A SINGLE FEMALE I THINK MY SUCCESS LAY IN 
ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELD SURVEY MORE 
THAN ANYTHING ELSE I HAVE NEVER 
LIKED EXCAVATION VERY MUCH AND THE 
SUCCESS MUST BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE 
HELP THAT I WAS GIVEN WHEN I FIRST 
STARTED FIELD SURVEY HE SHOWED ME 
WHAT TO LOOK FOR AND I FOUND 
INNUMERABLE SIDES THAT OTHER 
ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE JUST PASSED BY 
HE WAS A SUPPORT THAT OFFICIAL OF 
THE PAKISTANI ARCHAEOLOGICAL 
DEPARTMENT HE WAS ILLITERATE BUT 
HE HAD A MARVELLOUSLY RETENTIVE 
MEMORY HE WOULD LOOK FIRST OF ALL 
TO SEE WHERE LIKELY SETTLEMENTS 
WERE AND I LEARNED MORE FROM HIM 
REALLY THAN FROM ANY ACADEMIC 
COURSE FOR BOOKS THAT I READ WE 
HAD AN EXCELLENT RAPPORT ALTHOUGH 
HE TREATED ME RATHER LIKE A NURSE 
AND A CHILD HE WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE 
SHOCKED I THINK THAT I WOULD NOT 
HESITATE TO POUR MY DRESS UP IF I 
HAD TO SLIDE DOWN A BANK ONE THINK 
IT WAS JUST GENERALLY THE THING 
THAT FEMALES DID NOT DO BUT I WAS 
DETERMINED TO GET TO A SITE WILLY 
NILLY IN THE DAYS WHEN I WAS 
WORKING THERE ENGLISHWOMEN DID NOT 
REALLY MIX WITH SUPPORT AND THAT 
MEMBERS OF SOCIETY THERE WAS A 
CLASS DISTINCTION AS WELL AS A 
COLOUR DISTINCTION BUT I NEVER 
FELT THAT IF I LIKE A PERSON WE 
GET ON WELL TOGETHER THAT IS ALL 
THAT MATTERS I CONSIDERED MARRIAGE 
ON TWO OCCASIONS BUT SADLY MY 
FIRST FIANCE WAS KILLED DURING THE 
WAR AND THE MAN I WOULD HAVE 
MARRIED DIED SUDDENLY ON ONE OF MY 
EXPEDITIONS I NO LONGER EXECRATE 
BECAUSE I CANNOT GET IN AND OUT OF 
TRENCHES EASILY EXCAVATE BUT I 
HAVE THE SPECIALIST KNOWLEDGE TO BE 
ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND DATE 
PREHISTORIC POTTERY FROM CERTAIN 
EARLY YEARS AND I AM ABLE TO HELP 
CATALOGUE MATERIAL FOUND DURING 
EMERGENCY EXCAVATIONS THEY THEN GO 
INTO THE MUSEUM I WORK OVER THEM 
CATALOGUE THEM AND THEY ARE PUT ON 
COMPUTER SO THAT THE MUSEUM KNOWS 
EXACTLY WHAT PERIOD I OF ARTEFACT 
IT HAS IN ITS COLLECTIONS I DO NOT 
THINK THAT I RESEMBLE INDIANA JONES 
IN MANY WAYS I WOULD PREFER NOT TO 
BE COMPARED WITH HIM BECAUSE I 
HAVE AN IMAGE TO PROJECT WHICH I 
WANT TO BE AN ACADEMIC ONE NOT 
THAT OF AN ADVENTURER 
NINETY THREE YEAR OLD BEATRICE DE CARDI 
ARCHAEOLOGIST ISN'T SHE AMAZING A 
REMINDER OF OUR TOP STORY 
DEMOCRATIC SUPPORTERS IN 
PENNSYLVANIA ARE CHOOSING THEM THEY 
WANT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN THE 
LATER STAGES OF THE INCREASINGLY 
BITTER CAMPAIGN BETWEEN HILLARY 
CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA MRS. 
CLINTON IS FAVOURED TO WIN 
PENNSYLVANIA THIS IS WORLD NEWS 
TODAY TODAY AND THAT IS ALL FROM THE PROGRAMME 
NEXT ON B. B. C. FOR THE WEATHER WITH 
DARREN BET FROM ME ZEINAB BADAWI 
AND THE REST OF THE TEAM GOODBYE 
HELLO THERE IT HAS BEEN A NICE DAY 
TODAY AND IMPROVING STORY FOR 
TOMORROW STARTING WITH A BIT OF 
RAIN MOVING EASTWARDS WHICH SHOULD 
CLEAR AWAY FROM MOST AREAS WITH 
SUNNY SPELLS DEVELOPING THIS 
WEATHER FRONT IS PRODUCING A NARROW 
BAND OF RAIN MOVING QUITE SLOWLY 
EASTWARDS TAKING THAT RAIN WITH IT 
AS WELL BUT AFTER THAT BY THE 
MORNING THE RAIN SHOULD HAVE 
CLEARED AWAY FROM WALES THE SOUTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND AND NORTHERN 
IRELAND THE SUNSHINE FOLLOWS THE 
BAND OF RAIN EASTWARDS TAKING A 
WHILE TO CLEAR AWAY FROM SOME 
EASTERN PARTS OF THE U. K. WE WILL 
STILL SEEK RAIN AT THE FAR NORTH 
EAST OF SCOTLAND WELL INTO THE 
AFTERNOON OUT TO THE WEST ARE A 
FEW SHOWERS AND WESTERN SCOTLAND 
BUT IMPROVING THROUGH THE DAY FOR 
NORTHERN ENGLAND STILL CLOUDY AND 
DOWN TOWARDS THE COAST OF 
LINCOLNSHIRE AND EAST ANGLIA THE 
LAST OF THE RAIN CLEARING FROM THE 
LONDON AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON 
WITH LATE SUNSHINE ARRIVING BETTER 
LUCK FOR WESTERN PARTS AND WALES A 
DECENT DAY WITH JUST ONE OR TWO 
VERY LIGHT SHOWERS COMING INTO THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND ONE OR TWO 
LIGHT SHOWERS ACROSS NORTHERN 
IRELAND BUT SOME SUNSHINE IN 
BETWEEN TEMPERATURES A BIT ABOVE 
AVERAGE FOR THE TIME OF YEAR AS 
THIS WEATHER FRONT CLEARS AWAY FROM 
THE EASTERN MOST PARTS OF THE U. K. 
ANOTHER MORE ACTIVE FRONT IS MOVING 
IN FOR THURSDAY THAT IS GOING TO 
PRODUCE HEAVIER RAIN THAT WILL 
MOVE EASTWARDS AND FOLLOWING ON 
FROM THAT WE WILL SEE SOME SUNSHINE 
BUT THIS TIME MORE SHOWERS THEY 
COULD BE A LITTLE HEAVY 
TEMPERATURES MORE NORMAL FOR THE 
TIME OF YEAR AT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN
