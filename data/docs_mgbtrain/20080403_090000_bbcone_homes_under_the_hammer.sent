LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PROPERTY SIDE OF THINGS WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR WHEN YOU BUY A PROPERTY 
PROPERTY CONTINUES TO INTEREST PEOPLE 
AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT PROPERTY AS AN INVESTMENT 
IT'S A GREAT INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY IT AT THE RIGHT PRICE FIRST 
ONE WAY TO DO THAT COULD BE BY GOING TO A PROPERTY AUCTION 
THE PROPERTIES ON TODAY'S SHOW ARE ALL VERY DIFFERENT 
BUT THEIR NEW OWNERS WILL BE HOPING THAT THEY MAKE MONEY FROM THEM 
SO LET'S SEE WHAT THEY HAVE BOUGHT 
IT SEEMS SOMEONE HAS ALREADY STARTED RENOVATING THIS HOUSE IN EXETER 
LOOKS TO ME AS IF THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THAT PLASTERWORK 
I FIND OUT WHY THIS PROPERTY ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT IS WORTH ALMOST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
I'VE GOT TO SAY THAT IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A GLORIFIED WOODEN SHED 
AND I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE GORGEOUS WYE VALLEY IN WALES 
EVEN THROUGH THE DOOR I'M STILL NOT SURE WHAT I'VE FOUND 
ALL THESE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN SOLD AT AUCTION 
WE'LL FIND OUT WHO BOUGHT THEM AND WHAT THEY PAID FOR THEM WHEN THEY WENT UNDER THE HAMMER 
SOLD 
THE RIVER EXE WHERE EXETER GETS ITS NAME 
IT'S ACTUALLY DIVIDED THE CITY IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE 
TRADITIONALLY THAT SIDE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BIT MORE AFFLUENT 
AND PROPERTY PRICES OVER THERE ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THIS SIDE SAINT THOMAS 
WHICH HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A BIT CHEAPER 
AND THEREFORE IT'S THE PLACE TO FIND PROPERTY BARGAINS 
THE AREA HAS LOTS OF TERRACED VICTORIAN PROPERTIES 
SOME HAVE ALREADY BEEN REFURBISHED BUT THERE ARE QUITE A FEW STILL WAITING TO BE RESTORED 
AND I RECKON THAT THIS IS ONE OF THEM 
IT'S A TWO STOREY THREE BEDROOMED END OF TERRACE 
DEFINITELY IN NEED OF REPAIR AND RESTORATION 
HOWEVER IT'S GOT A GUIDE PRICE OF JUST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND QUID 
IT'S GOT LOTS OF CHARACTER ON THE OUTSIDE 
INSIDE IT'S GOT LOTS OF CLUTTER 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE GOT 
ENTRANCE HALL HERE 
INTERESTING PLACE FOR A WINDOW THAT MIGHT COME IN USEFUL IF YOU WERE CONSIDERING OTHER OPTIONS 
INTERESTING STAIRWAY THERE 
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PROPERTIES WHERE SOMEBODY HAS LEFT BUT NOT TAKEN THEIR BELONGINGS WITH THEM 
WE'VE GOT A SOFA VERY HANDY 
LOVELY HERE IN THE BACK ROOM IT'S PRETTY POOR 
WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON WITH THAT 
THAT ARCHWAY WAS CLEARLY NOT DESIGNED VERY CAREFULLY LOOK HOW LOW IT IS RIDICULOUS 
IT GETS WORSE AS YOU COME THROUGH THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY MORE CLUTTER BUT LOOK 
THIS IS BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
OH WHAT IS IT IT'S A KITCHEN IT'S A CONSERVATORY IT'S A DISASTER 
WHAT'S MORE IT'S JUST SINGLE SKIN CONSTRUCTION WHICH WON'T PASS CURRENT BUILDING REGULATIONS 
BACK IN THE MAIN PART OF THE HOUSE IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THE KITCHEN IS A TOTAL MESS 
SO WILL NEED RIPPING OUT AND JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE 
IF YOU'RE BRAVE ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH THE KITCHEN YOU REACH THE BATHROOM 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SKIP LOADS OF JUNK BEFORE YOU'LL KNOW IF THE WALLS CAN BE RE PLASTERED 
UPSTAIRS THANKFULLY THINGS ARE IN SLIGHTLY BETTER CONDITION 
STILL GOT THIS SILLY SILLY HANDRAIL THERE 
WHO ON EARTH PUTS SOMETHING LIKE THIS INSIDE 
GREAT IN THE GARDEN OR AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE BUT REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING MORE REFINED PLEASE 
WE'VE GOT THREE DOUBLE BEDROOMS ONE AT THE BACK THERE 
ONE HERE IN THE MIDDLE LOOKS LIKE THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THE PLASTER 
IT DOESN'T LOOK THAT PROFESSIONAL BUT AT THE FRONT HERE 
A LOVELY BIG ALMOST LIKE A TRIPLE BEDROOM 
LOVELY TO SEE THAT 
AND THE OTHER THING YOU GET WHEN UP HERE IS A FEELING OF LIGHT 
THERE'S A WINDOW THERE LOTS OF NATURAL LIGHT 
WE LIKE THAT A LOT 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IF IT'S BRIGHT AND SPACIOUS EVEN WHEN IT'S IN THIS STATE 
IMAGINE WHAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE WHEN IT'S FINISHED 
I'VE ASKED SOMEONE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE LOCAL PROPERTY MARKET 
TO COME AND HAVE A LOOK AROUND 
AS THE HOUSE IS IN SUCH POOR CONDITION IT WILL NEED COMPLETE RENOVATION 
THE AGENT HAS AN IDEA HOW TO MAXIMISE ITS POTENTIAL 
IF IT WAS ME PERSONALLY I'D TURN IT INTO A ONE BEDROOM FLAT DOWNSTAIRS 
WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF GOING INTO A ONE BEDROOM OR TWO BEDROOM UPSTAIRS IF YOU COULD GO INTO THE ROOF SPACE 
WITH PRICES FOR THREE BEDROOMED TERRACES LIMITED IN THIS AREA 
YOU'D PROBABLY MAKE MORE SELLING IT AS TWO FLATS HOW MUCH MORE 
IF IT WAS SPLIT INTO TWO FLATS YOU'D BE LOOKING AT APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED TEN TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOR THE ONE BEDROOM FLAT 
AND BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOR A TWO BEDROOM 
SO THERE'S PLENTY OF RETURN THERE 
SO THERE'S SERIOUS MONEY TO BE MADE BY THE RIGHT DEVELOPER 
BUT AS WELL AS ALL THE HARD WORK NEEDED THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE TO CONSIDER 
I'VE SAVED ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES ABOUT THIS PROPERTY TILL LAST 
THAT AS YOU CAN SEE IS A TRAIN LINE 
IT'S ACTUALLY THE MAIN LINE TO LONDON SO ANYONE WHO BUYS THIS 
IS GOING TO HAVE THAT TRUNDLING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS 
PROBABLY EVERY TWENTY MINUTES OR SO 
IS THAT A BIG ISSUE 
PROBABLY IT IS TO ME 
LET'S GO TO THE AUCTION 
TO FIND OUT WHO WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO BUY THIS HOUSE 
WITH NO ROOF OVER THE BATH AND A RAILWAY TRACK IN THE BACK GARDEN 
NUMBER NINETEEN IS THIRTY FIVE ALBION STREET NO ADDENDUM THERE

WELL DONE 
SO FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX THOUSAND THE NEW OWNER OF THE END OF TERRACE HOUSE IN EXETER IS CHRIS 
HE AND HIS PARTNER HAVE JUST RECENTLY MOVED HERE FROM LONDON 
AND THIS IS THE SECOND PROPERTY CHRIS NOW HAS IN EXETER 
CHRIS NICE TO MEET YOU AND YOU 
BIT OF A CHALLENGE AHEAD OF YOU HERE I RECKON 
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE HOUSE THAT YOU THOUGHT YEAH THIS ONE'S FOR ME I LIKED THE OUTSIDE CHARACTER 
AND I'VE RECENTLY DONE A SIMILAR PROPERTY AND I COULD SEE THE POTENTIAL IN THIS ONE 
I COULD PUT IT INTO TWO SEPARATE UNITS SO A ONE BED AND A TWO BED FLAT 
SO A FLAT CONVERSION YEAH IS THIS SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR A WHILE NO 
LITERALLY MOVED DOWN FROM LONDON SIX MONTHS AGO TO DO THE FIRST PROPERTY 
SO THIS'LL BE THE SECOND PROPERTY WE'RE DOING WE'RE YOU DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR IN LONDON NO 
I WORKED FOR A DESIGN CONSULTANCY SO I JUST FANCIED A CHANGE I NEEDED TO GET OUT OF LONDON 
GET INTO THE COUNTRY SO W. H. Y. E X. E. T. E. R. 
I DIDN'T WANT TO MOVE SOMEWHERE TOO SMALL OBVIOUSLY COMING FROM LONDON 
SO WE LOOKED AT EXETER AND JUST GOT A GOOD FEEL FOR IT 
IT WAS NEAR TO THE COAST IT'S GOT A NICE QUAY 
AND THE TOWN ITSELF SEEMS TO BE PRETTY UP AND COMING 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PROPERTY SIDE OF THINGS WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR WHEN YOU BUY A PROPERTY 
JUST SOMEWHERE THAT'S GOT POTENTIAL 
I DIDN'T WANT TO JUST THESE DAYS BUY SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST PUT A BIT OF PAINT ON IT 
AND PUT IT BACK ON THE MARKET I THINK YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING MORE 
SO WE LOOKED TO THIS ONE AND SAW THAT IT COULD BE NICE 
BECAUSE IT'S GOT CHARACTER FEATURES THAT'S GOOD ADVICE IT'S WHAT CHRIS DID ON HIS PREVIOUS RENOVATION 
LITERALLY A MINUTE'S WALK FROM THEIR NEW PROPERTY 
IT USED TO BE A CORNER SHOP AND IT'S NOW TWO FLATS CHRIS DID A GREAT JOB 
AND HAS SIMILAR PLANS FOR THIS PLACE WHAT DOES HE INTEND TO TACKLE FIRST 
THE FIRST THING IS I WORK UPSTAIRS FIRST 
SO I NEED TO CONVERT THE LOFT INTO A NEW BEDROOM OH REALLY 
AND THEN I'M GOING TO CHANGE SOME OF THE LAYOUTS SO I'VE GOT A KITCHEN DINER UPSTAIRS 
WITH A SEPARATE BATHROOM AND THEN ONE BEDROOM AND THEN DOWNSTAIRS 
THERE'LL BE A LOUNGE KITCHEN ONE BED AND THEN BATHROOM AT THE BACK 
SO THE BIGGEST EXPENSE IS THE LOFT CONVERSION 
ERM YEAH THE LOFT CONVERSION'S THE BIGGEST EXPENSE REWIRING THAT'S FAIRLY EXPENSIVE 
AND JUST SEPARATING ALL THE UTILITIES WATER GAS AND ELECTRICS THEY SORT OF TAKE A FEW THOUSAND EACH 
RIGHT AND THEN THE FIRE SAFETY THAT YOU HAVE TO DO NOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONVERT IT INTO TWO PROPERTIES 
ALL THE INSULATION ALL THOSE SORT OF THINGS SOON ADD UP 
WITH CONVERSIONS TO FLATS YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE THE COST OF FIRE ALARMS 
CHRIS PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX THOUSAND AT THE AUCTION 
AND HAS BUDGETED AROUND FORTY THOUSAND TO DO THE WORK 
UPSTAIRS HE KNOWS HOW HE WANTS THE LAYOUT OF THE FLAT TO LOOK 
THIS WILL BE A BEDROOM AND WHAT HAPPENS HERE 
THERE'S GOING TO BE A DOORWAY THAT GOES THROUGH INTO THIS ROOM HERE 
AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A BATHROOM 
AND THIS HERE WILL BE A KITCHEN AREA THAT GOES ON TO AN OPEN DINING AREA 
THIS WHOLE WALL WILL BE KNOCKED OUT 
WELL IT'S A CRACKING PLAN 
AND ONCE THE WALL'S KNOCKED DOWN THIS LOUNGE COME DINER WILL LOOK MAGNIFICENT 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY 
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE WORST BITS THE ROOF'S A DISASTER 
PUT ON NEW ROOFS IN THE CONSERVATORY AND WHERE THE BATHROOM IS REINSULATE THE WALLS AND RESKIM THOSE 
THIS WILL BE A KITCHEN AREA WHERE WE ARE NOW AND THERE'S THE FRONT ROOM AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
JUDGING BY THE FINISH HE'S ACHIEVED IN HIS OTHER CONVERSION THE BATHROOM COULD LOOK STUNNING 
AND AFTER MOVING TO THE DEVON COAST HE'S DISCOVERED THAT AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF SURFING 
IS A WAY TO KEEP THE BUDGET DOWN 
I'VE FOUND THAT I BUY A LOT OF THE KITCHEN AND BATHROOM FITTINGS OVER THE INTERNET 
AND I FIND THAT CAN SAVE SIXTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT DOING THAT 
ARE THEY SECOND HAND 
NO BRAND NEW BUT THEY JUST HAVEN'T GOT THE MARK UP THAT THE SHOPS PUT ON 
AS AN EXAMPLE HOW MUCH CAN YOU SAVE ON A TAP 
THE TAPS I LAST BOUGHT I BOUGHT FOR TWENTY FIVE OVER THE INTERNET 
I SAW THEM IN THE HIGH STREET SHOPS FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
GOOD GRIEF 
IT'S A BIG SAVING 
WELL CHRIS HAD BETTER GET SURFING QUICKLY BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO NEED PLENTY OF TAPS 
TO CONVERT THIS HOUSE SINCE HE WON'T HAVE TO TRAIPSE AROUND THE SHOPS 
HE SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO ENJOY HIS NEW LIFESTYLE BY THE SEA 
IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT CHRIS HAS GIVEN HIMSELF A REASONABLE BUDGET FOR THIS JOB 
BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THIS ONE AND BEAR IN MIND THIS IS ONLY HIS SECOND PROJECT 
SO WILL IT ALL GO TO PLAN WE CAN FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW 
THIS IS WOOTTON BRIDGE 
A SMALL VILLAGE BETWEEN RYDE AND NEWPORT ON THE NORTH OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT 
THE PROPERTY I'M HERE TO SEE IS REALLY TUCKED AWAY AND VERY MUCH OFF THE BEATEN TRACK 
IN AN AREA KNOWN LOCALLY AS LITTLE CANADA 
I'M TRYING TO FIND AN AUCTION PROPERTY TODAY ACCESS IS NOT BRILLIANT 
I'VE HAD TO PARK MY CAR RIGHT THE WAY AROUND THE LANE AND WALK DOWN HERE 
IS IT A SECRET LOCATION OR IS IT JUST A BIT OF A PAIN 
I'VE GOT TO SAY THAT IT LOOKS LIKE A GLORIFIED WOODEN SHED THAT'S IT THE GUIDE PRICE 
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY GRAND 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AROUND 
SO THIS IS A TIMBER FRAMED BUILDING 
NOW I KNOW THAT YOU MAY HAVE A FEW PROBLEMS GETTING A MORTGAGE ON THIS 
IT'S QUITE STRANGE YOU WALK STRAIGHT IN TO THE UPSTAIRS PART OF THE HOUSE 
IN ACTUAL FACT IT SORT OF SLOPES DOWN THIS WAY I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED 
IF THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF MOVEMENT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS 
BUT IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE A HOLIDAY HOME 
YOU'VE GOT A BEDROOM THERE VERY DARK INDEED WITH A FEW SMALL WINDOWS 
AND IN HERE A PINK ROOM YES THIS ROOM IS PINK FAIRLY SMALL AS WELL 
BUT YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BATHROOM WITH A CORNER BATH EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR A HOLIDAY HOME 
IT'S GOT A REALLY NICE FEELING ABOUT IT BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT I NOW KNOW WHY THE GUIDE PRICE IS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE I CAN SEE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T LET ME TAKE YOU OUT HERE 
NOW OUTSIDE THERE IS A HUGE ROOF TERRACE 
IMAGINE THE BARBECUES AND THE PARTIES CAN YOU SEE IT YET 
LOOK AT THIS 
THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL DIRECT BEACH ACCESS 
YOU'VE GOT VIEWS OF THE MAINLAND IN PORTSMOUTH 
THIS IS CALLED THE SOLENT 
IT IS JUST FANTASTIC HERE I LOVE IT 
THE SUN IS SHINING 
THE WEATHER IS SWEET 
MAKE YOU WANNA MOVE 
YOUR DANCING FEET 
NOT ONLY DO YOU GET THE WOODEN CHALET THE MAGNIFICENT SEA VIEWS 
BUT YOU ALSO GET YOUR OWN SECTION OF PRIVATE BEACH 
YOU COULD GET A JET SKI A BOAT BUCKETS AND SPADES THE KIDS WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT HERE 
IT'S JUST IDYLLIC REALLY 
BUT BEFORE I GET TOO CARRIED AWAY 
I NEED TO CHECK OUT THE REST OF THE HOUSE 
SOME HOLIDAY HOMES HAVE RESTRICTED COVENANTS MEANING YOU CAN ONLY STAY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS A YEAR 
BUT I'M HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT THIS PROPERTY HAS FULL RESIDENTIAL RIGHTS 
YOU'VE GOT A FANTASTIC LOUNGE AREA YOU'VE GOT AN OPEN PLAN KITCHEN 
YOU'VE GOT MAINS ELECTRICITY THERE'S OIL FIRED CENTRAL HEATING 
MAINS WATER THERE'S A TELEPHONE CONNECTION THERE'S A SEPTIC TANK TO THE BATHROOM 
NOW I KNOW IT FEELS AND LOOKS LIKE A HOLIDAY HOME 
BUT I THINK THE GOOD THING IS YOU COULD LIVE HERE ALL YEAR ROUND 
HOW FANTASTIC WOULD THAT BE 
AND THAT FULL RESIDENTIAL STATUS IS WHAT MAKES THIS 
A FAR MORE VALUABLE AND DESIRABLE PROPERTY 
OF COURSE IT DOES NEED SOME WORK 
HERE I AM 
IT'S OBVIOUS I'M SOLD BUT WHAT CAN A LOCAL PROPERTY EXPERT TELL ME ABOUT THIS SEASIDE GEM 
IN THE AREA CURIOUSLY NAMED LITTLE CANADA 
REPUTEDLY THE NAME LITTLE CANADA 
COMES FROM THE FACT THAT THE CANADIAN ARMY USED THIS AREA AS A TRAINING BASE IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE 
AHEAD OF THE RAID ON DIEPPE THEY WERE BASED AND TRAINED HERE 
IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE OLD HUTS YOU CAN SEE AN AIR OF NISSEN HUT ABOUT THEM 
ALTHOUGH MOST OBVIOUSLY HAVE LONG BEEN DEMOLISHED AND BETTER STRUCTURES PUT IN THEIR PLACE 
WITH A GUIDE PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
THE BIG ATTRACTION OF THE PROPERTY IS ITS LOCATION 
BUT THERE ARE SOME DRAWBACKS AS WELL 
THE NEGATIVES ARE THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT A TRADITIONALLY BUILT PROPERTY 
IT'S LARGELY TIMBER AND IN THE WINTER IT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT BLEAK WHEN PERHAPS THE SUN DOESN'T COME OUT 
APART FROM THAT PARKING IS AN ISSUE YOU CAN'T GET A CAR TOO CLOSE 
BUT REALLY THAT'S ABOUT IT AS FAR AS NEGATIVES ARE CONCERNED 
SO AS IDYLLIC AS THIS IS IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO GET A MORTGAGE BECAUSE OF ITS WOODEN STRUCTURE 
BUT THE REAL VALUE HERE IS IN ITS POTENTIAL RETURN ONCE IT'S RENOVATED 
WITH THE HOLIDAY SEASON ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT LONGER THAN MOST 
THERE'S A STRONG CHANCE OF MAKING A GOOD INCOME FROM LETTING IT OUT 
IN THE HEIGHT OF SEASON YOU COULD COMMAND A HOLIDAY RENT HERE OF BETWEEN EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY AND PERHAPS NINE HUNDRED FIFTY A WEEK 
IT WOULD ACHIEVE THAT SORT OF INCOME 
THE SUN IS SHINING 
THE WEATHER IS SWEET 
WHAT SELLS THIS PROPERTY IS THE LOCATION 
RIGHT ON THE BEACH FANTASTIC SEA VIEWS 
FOR MOST PEOPLE IT WON'T REALLY MATTER WHAT THIS PLACE LOOKS LIKE OR WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE 
WHAT THEY'LL BE BUYING HERE IS THE RIGHT TO SIT AND LOOK AT ALL OF THIS 
SO LET'S FIND OUT WHO WANTED TO LIVE BY THE SEASIDE WHEN IT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER 
FABULOUS OPPORTUNITY THAT VIEW EVERY MORNING 
SOMEONE START ME AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY DO I HAVE AN OPENING BID AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THEN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DO I SEE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM 
THANK YOU SIR WE'RE ON OUR WAY AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
SOMEONE MAKE IT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY 
DO I SEE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE I'M BID DO I SEE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TO MY LEFT AGAINST YOU NOW 
MAKE IT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
I'LL TAKE TWO TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO 
AND FIVE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MAKE IT SEVEN AGAINST YOU AT THE MOMENT AT THE BACK IT'S ON MY LEFT 
I'M LOOKING FOR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN DO I SEE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN 
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE I'M BID TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN FABULOUS OPPORTUNITY DON'T MISS IT GIVE ME ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE I'M BID 
NO FURTHER BIDS PLEASE BOTH BIDDERS TALK TO ME AFTERWARDS 
WELL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO FOR YOU ON THAT PROPERTY 
SURPRISINGLY THE CHALET BY THE SEA FAILED TO SELL AT AUCTION 
AS THE RESERVE PRICE WASN'T MET BUT ALL WAS NOT LOST 
AFTER THE AUCTION A DEAL WAS STRUCK BY PROPERTY DEVELOPING BROTHERS MARK AND NEIL WHO OFFERED TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
AND SECURED THE DEAL 
NEED I ASK YOU WHY YOU WANTED TO BUY IT 
WE BOTH LIVE IN THE SOUTHAMPTON AREA WE'VE GOT FAMILIES THERE YOUNG CHILDREN 
WE WANTED SOMEWHERE WE CAN USE AS A FAMILY HOLIDAY HOME FOR OURSELVES AND OUR FRIENDS 
THE PLAN IS TO BUILD A RIB A BIT AND JUST MOTOR HALF AN HOUR ACROSS THE WATER 
AND YOU'RE HERE IT'S FANTASTIC CAN'T BEAT IT 
HOW COOL IS THAT ARE YOU GUYS BOATY PEOPLE WE WILL BE 
THAT MEANS NO 
SO FAR WE'VE ONLY USED OTHER PEOPLE'S WE KNOW PEOPLE WITH BOATS SO WE'LL JOIN THAT CLUB 
WE'LL TRADE THEY CAN STAY HERE WE'LL USE THEIR BOAT 
AT TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND THIS PURCHASE IS FOR PLEASURE 
I AM A LITTLE MORE THAN JEALOUS 
BUT I CAN TAKE SOME COMFORT FROM THE FACT THAT THE PROPERTY IS IN GOOD HANDS 
MARK AND NEIL HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS FOR TWENTY YEARS 
WE'VE ALWAYS BOUGHT PROPERTIES WHICH WE'VE USED TO BUILD A PORTFOLIO 
RECENTLY WE ACQUIRED A BUILDING IN SOUTHAMPTON 
AN OLD SCHOOL BUILDING WHICH WE CONVERTED INTO FORTY FOUR FLATS 
THAT WAS OUR FIRST MAJOR DEVELOPMENT 
THAT WAS EXCITING WE WERE PLEASED WHEN IT WHEN THROUGH AND WE HAD THE MONEY IN THE BANK FANTASTIC 
THAT'S ALLOWED YOU TO BUY THIS YEAH AND OTHER THINGS TOO 
YEAH COS WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE ANY MONEY ON THIS ONE 
SO WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU CLAPPED EYES ON THIS 
PROBABLY WOW IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY 
AND I SAID LET'S NOT GET CARRIED AWAY COS THE WEATHER'S FANTASTIC 
WE JUST STOOD HERE IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY PEACEFUL 
I THINK THE ISLE OF WIGHT IS UNDERRATED IT'S NOT HIT ITS PROPER POTENTIAL 
SO IGNORING THE FACT WE WANT IT FOR OURSELVES AND THAT'S OUR MAIN MOTIVATOR 
LONGTERM THERE'S DEFINITELY INVESTMENT POTENTIAL HERE AS WELL 
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO INSIDE TO GIVE IT THE WOW FACTOR 
WE'LL MAKE THE BEDROOMS BIGGER PUT ANOTHER BATHROOM IN 
WE'LL ADD A THIRD BEDROOM 
AND SPEAK TO THE PLANNERS IF THEY'D ALLOW US TO REBUILD AND MAKE IT LARGER 
IF THEY DON'T ALLOW US TO REBUILD WE'LL KEEP IT AS IS BUT WE'LL HAVE A HOT TUB AS WELL 
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA BE SITTING OUT THERE WITH YOUR CHAMPAGNE LOOKING AT THE SEA VIEWS 
THAT'S THE PLAN 
NOW I'M REALLY ENVIOUS 
BUT HOW FAR THE BROTHERS GONNA PUSH THE BOAT OUT TO ACHIEVE THIS LIFESTYLE 
IT DEPENDS HOW FAR WE GO REALLY THE SIMPLEST BUDGET WE'RE COMING IN AROUND THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY THOUSAND MARK 
IT COULD GO OVER THE TWENTY IF THE PLANNERS SAY YES YOU CAN BUILD SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER 
THEN IT'D BE A DIFFERENT KETTLE NEIL DO YOU SAY RIGHT THAT'S IT IT'S NOT GOING OVER TWENTY 
THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT MARK AND WE'RE NOT SPENDING ANY MORE 
IDEALLY THEY'D MAKE THE CHALET BIGGER 
BUT DEVELOPING THIS PROPERTY MAY NOT ALL BE PLAIN SAILING 
THERE'S THAT TRICKY ACCESS TO CONSIDER 
DO THESE CANNY DEVELOPERS HAVE A SOLUTION 
PARKING IS A PROBLEM AT THE END OF THIS LANE THERE IS PARKING FOR ONE CAR 
WHICH FOR A PROPERTY THIS SIZE AND TO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE HERE IS NOT IDEAL 
SO WE LOOKED AT HOW TO IMPROVE THAT SITUATION WE BECAME AWARE OF ANOTHER AVAILABLE PROPERTY NEARBY 
AND THAT CONTROLS THE TRACK WE'RE ON NOW IT EFFECTIVELY OWNS IT 
SO WE'VE BOUGHT THAT AS WELL YOU'RE JOKING NO 
SO WE'VE BOUGHT THAT AND IT ENABLES US TO CONTROL THIS WE CAN UPGRADE IT 
WE CAN IMPLEMENT PERHAPS A PULL IN INTO THE PROPERTY 
OR JUST HAVE FURTHER PARKING DOWN HERE 
SO NEXT TIME I COME TO SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING I CAN BRING MY CAR UP TO THE DOOR YOU CAN COME BY RIB 
CAN I INDEED EVEN BETTER 
THIS STORY JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER 
THE BROTHERS NOW HAVE TWO PROPERTIES IN THIS GORGEOUS SETTING 
AND THE EXPERIENCE TO MAKE IT A REALLY SPECIAL PLACE 
WELL MARK AND NEIL CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THE PROPERTY MARKET 
TWENTY YEARS OF BUYING SELLING AND LETTING 
IT'S ALWAYS INTRIGUING TO SEE WHAT PROPERTY DEVELOPERS DO WHEN THEY BUY SOMEWHERE THAT ISN'T FOR BUSINESS 
BUT FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL USE 
WILL BUDGETS AND TIME SCALES AND ALL SORTS LONGTERM INVESTMENT POTENTIAL GO RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW 
WILL THEY SPEND A FORTUNE MAKING THIS INTO THEIR DREAM RETREAT 
THEY MIGHT BLOW THE LOT ON BUYING A BOAT TO GET HERE 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME 
COMING UP A TRADITIONAL COTTAGE IN WALES THAT'S NOT SO TRADITIONAL 
IT'S HAD A RESTORATION BUT NOT ONE I DON'T THINK PARTICULARLY IN CHARACTER 
ARE THE BROTHERS LIVING IT UP ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT 
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA BE SITTING OUT THERE WITH YOUR CHAMPAGNE LOOKING AT THE SEA VIEWS THAT'S THE PLAN 
FIRST HAS RED TAPE HELD UP THE RENOVATION IN EXETER 
PLANNING PERMISSION WAS A BIT OF A NIGHTMARE TOOK OVER SIX MONTHS TO GET 
THIS WAS THE SIGHT THAT GREETED FORMER DESIGNER CHRIS 
WHEN HE BOUGHT THIS END OF TERRACE AT AUCTION IN EXETER FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX THOUSAND 
AND IT WASN'T PRETTY 
PSYCHO 
CHRIS HAD ALREADY RENOVATED ONE HOUSE AROUND THE CORNER 
SO WAS CONFIDENT HE COULD DO IT AGAIN 
THIS TIME HE WANTED TO CREATE TWO FLATS 
I'VE WAITED NEARLY EIGHT MONTHS BEFORE COMING BACK TO SEE HOW HE'S GOT ON 
AND TO FIND OUT IF HIS GRAND PLANS HAVE BECOME A REALITY 
FLAWLESS ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS 
FROM KITCHEN TO BEDROOM 
BEDROOM TO KITCHEN 
THIS IS A FLAWLESS RENOVATION 
GROUND FLOOR WE'VE A COMMUNAL HALLWAY AND ONTO THAT A SMALL PORCH 
WHICH LEADS INTO A LOUNGE SLASH DINING ROOM 
OFF THE DINING ROOM YOU HAVE A TOILET AND GOING THROUGH THE DINING ROOM YOU HAVE A KITCHEN 
LEADING ONTO A BEDROOM AND EN SUITE BATHROOM 
THE UPSTAIRS FLAT USED TO HAVE THREE BEDROOMS 
ONE OF THE BEDROOMS WE KEPT THE SAME JUST BUILT IN A NEW WARDROBE 
THE SECOND BEDROOM WE SPLIT INTO TWO IT'S NOW THE BATHROOM 
AND THE KITCHEN WITH A WALL IN BETWEEN 
A DESIGN FOR LIFE 
THE HOUSE LOOKS FAMILIAR FROM THE OUTSIDE 
AND IT IS THE RIGHT ADDRESS 
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS THE SAME PROPERTY 
CHRIS HAS COMPLETELY REBUILT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
HE'S MADE USE OF EVERY INCH OF SPACE AND HE'S DESIGNED THE WHOLE THING HIMSELF 
WHEN I BOUGHT IT I DREW UP LOOKING AT ALL THE CURRENT DIMENSIONS 
PUT THAT INTO A COMPUTER PACKAGE THAT LOOKED AT THE VARIOUS PERMUTATIONS 
TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE SPACE FOR STORAGE NUMBER OF BEDROOMS KITCHENS ETC 
FROM DESIGN CONSULTANT TO PROPERTY REVIVER CHRIS HAS GOT THIS RENOVATION JUST RIGHT 
HOW EXACTLY HAS HE MANAGED TO FIT IT ALL IN 
WE'RE IN THE UPSTAIRS KITCHEN SLASH DINER 
THERE WAS A WALL THAT WENT ACROSS HERE 
SO WE'VE TAKEN SPACE FROM THE ORIGINAL SECOND BEDROOM TO MAKE THE KITCHEN AREA 
MADE THESE WALLS HERE FOR THE FIRE REGULATIONS TO SEPARATE THE NEW STAIRWELL TO THE LOFT 
AND THE LIVING QUARTERS UPSTAIRS 
WE'RE IN THE DOWNSTAIRS LIVING AREA THIS IS THE KITCHEN 
THIS ROOM COULD BE CLASSED AS A DINER OR STUDY 
THAT DOOR USED TO LEAD TO THE HALLWAY WHICH LED TO UPSTAIRS 
THAT NOW IS A SEPARATE TOILET 
THIS DOORWAY'S NEW AND THERE USED TO A WINDOW IN THE WALL BUT THAT'S NOW A SMALL PORCH 
THE ARCH THAT WAS HERE HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT TO MAKE AN OPEN PLAN LIVING AREA 
CHRIS THEN CONVERTED THE ROOFSPACE INTO A MASTER BEDROOM 
MAKING THE TOP FLAT A TWO BED 
HE ALSO HAD TO ABIDE BY ALL THE REGULATIONS THAT HAVE TO BE COVERED IN THIS TYPE OF RENOVATION 
THE FIRE REGULATIONS I HAD TO PUT A LOT OF FIRE DOORS IN 
ALSO CREATED A CORRIDOR FOR THE UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 
SO THEY HAD A WAY OF ESCAPE THAT WASN'T GOING INTO ANOTHER ROOM 
ALSO THERE'S HEAT DETECTORS AND INTER CONNECTED SMOKE ALARMS IN EVERY ROOM 
ALTHOUGH IT TOOK NEARLY SIX MONTHS FOR THE PLANNERS TO AGREE I THINK IT'S BEEN WORTH IT 
IT'S ALL GONE TO PLAN 
BUT CHRIS DIDN'T EXPECT TO REPLACE ALL THE WINDOWS 
AND HE HAD TO GET THE GAS AND ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES SPLIT 
ADDED TO THOSE FIRE REGULATIONS HOW'S HIS BUDGET HELD UP 
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE BETWEEN THIRTY THOUSAND TO FORTY THOUSAND AND I SHOULD'VE JUST COME IN UNDER THE FORTY THOUSAND MARK 
THAT BRINGS HIS TOTAL EXPENDITURE TO JUST SHY OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
BUT CHRIS IS SO PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS HE'S MOVED IN 
WE MOVED INTO THE PROPERTY COS WE'VE JUST SOLD THE PROPERTY WE WERE IN BEFORE 
SO WE'VE JUST MOVED INTO THE UPSTAIRS FLAT AS A STOPGAP TILL WE SORT OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING NEXT 
BUT HE ISN'T PLANNING ON STAYING LONG 
BOTH PROPERTIES ARE GOING ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND 
WE'RE HOPING THAT WE'LL SELL THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
HE SPENT JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IN TOTAL 
HE'S LOOKING FOR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND FOR EACH FLAT 
WHAT WILL TWO LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS MAKE OF THEM 
USE OF SPACE IN THE BUILDING IS VERY GOOD INDEED 
GROUND FLOOR FLAT NICE AND LIGHT AND AIRY 
GOOD USE OF THE SPACE NICE KITCHEN DOUBLE BEDROOM 
GOOD SIZED LIVING ROOM 
AND UPSTAIRS CERTAINLY YOU KNOW REALLY MAXIMISING THE SPACE 
HE'S DONE A REALLY REALLY NICE JOB 
THE PROPERTY LAST TIME 
NEEDED AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF WORK DONE TO IT 
HE'S MADE A REALLY NICE JOB OF THE FLAT DOWNSTAIRS 
AND MADE GOOD USE OF THE SPACE UPSTAIRS AS WELL 
THE PROPERTY'S BEEN VERY CLEVERLY DESIGNED 
MAXIMUM USE OF SPACE THE LITTLE NOOKS AND CRANNIES 
AND IT'S A NICE CONVERSION 
THE MAIN SELLING POINT FOR EACH PROPERTY IS THE CONDITION 
THE LOCATION IS ALSO VERY CONVENIENT 
CLOSE TO THE LOCAL AMENITIES AND THE CITY CENTRE ITSELF 
CHRIS HAS THE TWO FLATS ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND 
DO THE AGENTS AGREE WITH THOSE VALUATIONS 
IF I WERE TO MARKET THESE PROPERTIES 
I WOULD MARKET THE GROUND FLOOR AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
AND I WOULD MARKET THE TWO BEDROOM MAISONETTE AT ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
IF I WAS TO MARKET BOTH OF THESE PROPERTIES 
I WOULD MARKET THEM BOTH AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
I THINK THOSE PRICES WERE ABOUT RIGHT 
I WAS HOPING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY AND ONE HUNDRED FORTY MARK 
ANYTHING OVER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE WELL I'D BE VERY HAPPY WITH 
WITH THE DEMAND FOR RENTALS IN THE AREA 
THESE TWO FLATS WILL BE SOUGHT AFTER 
BUT HOW MUCH COULD THEY GET 
AND WOULD IT CONVINCE CHRIS TO HOLD ON TO THEM 
IF WE WERE TO PUT THESE PROPERTIES ON THE RENTAL MARKET 
THE ONE BEDROOM GROUND FLOOR WE'LL BE LOOKING TO ACHIEVE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE A CALENDAR MONTH 
AND THE TWO BEDROOM MAISONETTE SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE TO SIX HUNDRED FIFTY 
IF I WAS LOOKING TO RENT BOTH OF THESE PROPERTIES 
I WOULD BE LOOKING TO ACHIEVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIX HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE POUNDS A MONTH 
IT'D MAKE US POSSIBLE CONSIDER KEEPING HOLD OF ONE OF THEM 
THOSE EVALUATIONS YEAH 
ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS BY GEORGE MICHAEL 
IT'S TEMPTING TO KEEP THEM AND MAKE A NICE INCOME 
WHILE THE PROPERTIES MATURE IN VALUE 
BUT THE SEVENTY THOUSAND PROFIT HE'D MAKE FROM SELLING THEM IS TOO TEMPTING 
AND HE PLANS TO INVEST THE MONEY ABROAD 
WE'VE GOT THREE WEEKS PLANNED TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT AREAS OF FRANCE 
AND WE'VE GOT A LIST OF ABOUT THIRTY PROPERTIES MAINLY FARMHOUSES 
THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY CONVERT THE OUTBUILDINGS INTO GITES 
AND DEVELOP AS OUR NEXT PROJECT 
AS CHRIS BRUSHES US ON HIS COOKERY SKILLS IN PREPARATION FOR THE MOVE TO FRANCE 
I HAVE TO SAY I'D LOVE TO SEE WHAT HE COOKS UP WITH HIS NEXT PROPERTY 
AFTER THIS SUCCESS IT'S SURE TO BE A SIZZLER 
FOR THE NEXT PROPERTY UNDER THE HAMMER 
I'M GOING TO MONMOUTHSHIRE WHERE THE COUNTRYSIDE IS TRULY STUNNING 
THIS IS THE WYE VALLEY ON THE BORDERS OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN HERE IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO VISIT 
BUT IT'S ALSO A GREAT PLACE TO BUY PROPERTY 
MORE SPECIFICALLY I'M IN THE VILLAGE OF LLANDOGO 
WHICH IS HALFWAY BETWEEN MONMOUTH AND CHEPSTOW 
WHAT I'M HERE TO SEE IS A TWO BEDROOMED SEMI DETACHED COTTAGE 
I THINK THIS MUST BE IT 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY GRAND WHAT DO YOU GET FOR YOUR MONEY 
WELL THE OUTSIDE OF THE COTTAGE IS NOT IN BAD CONDITION 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE AN EXTENSION HAS BEEN ADDED IN THE PAST 
THE SURROUNDING SCENERY IS BEAUTIFUL 
THOUGH THE TREES ARE OVERGROWN AND WOULD NEED CUTTING BACK 
WHAT'S IT LIKE INSIDE 
THERE'S ALWAYS A GREAT SENSE OF ANTICIPATION 
WALKING IN TO A PROPERTY LIKE THIS 
AND YOU NEVER KNOW QUITE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND 
IN THIS CASE EVEN AFTER YOU WALK THROUGH THE DOOR 
I'M STILL NOT SURE WHAT I'VE FOUND 
BITS OF IT ARE LIKE AN OLD COTTAGE 
WE'VE GOT THE LOW CEILINGS WE'VE GOT THE VERY VERY THICK WALLS 
BUT IT'S BEEN COMPLETELY REFURBISHED 
THINGS LIKE THEY'VE PUT IN THIS OLD FIREPLACE 
WE'VE GOT THIS INTERESTING BUT SLIGHTLY CREAKY STAIRCASE 
JUDGING BY SOME OF THE THINGS I CAN SEE AND THE CEILING THERE 
IT LOOKS LIKE WALLS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT 
THERE STILL SOME ORIGINAL FEATURES LIKE THIS LITTLE OLD ALCOVE THERE 
BUT IT'S ALMOST LIKE I DON'T KNOW IT'S HAD A RESTORATION 
BUT NOT ONE I DON'T THINK PARTICULARLY IN CHARACTER 
FOR INSTANCE IT'S NOT A BAD SIZED KITCHEN HERE 
AND YES THE UNITS AGAIN FAIRLY MODERN 
IT FEELS TO ME LIKE SOMEBODY'S HAD A GO AT DOING THIS PLACE UP 
AND NOT SPENT ENOUGH MONEY ON IT THAT'S IT 
SO YOU COULD LIVE WITH IT AS IT IS 
BUT TO GET THE MOST FROM THIS COTTAGE I'D START AGAIN 
WELL UPSTAIRS MY INITIAL REACTION 
THAT I RECKON THIS PLACE WAS JUST COMPLETELY GUTTED AT ONE POINT IS BORNE OUT 
BUT UP HERE THEY'VE DONE QUITE A REASONABLE JOB 
YOU COME UP THE STAIRS A MASTER BEDROOM THERE 
MAKING FULL USE OF THE EVES UP HERE 
SO THAT'S A NICE SPACE LOTS OF LIGHT COMING IN THERE 
A BLANK CANVAS WHY DESIGN THE BATHROOM LIKE THAT 
LOOK YOU CAN'T EVEN STAND UP IN THE SHOWER 
THAT'S RIDICULOUS SO IT'S A LOT OF TROUBLE TO MOVE IT 
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE DIFFERENTLY IN THE FIRST PLACE 
BUT YOU COULD MOVE IT 
THROUGH TO THE SECOND BEDROOM AND YOU KNOW 
IT'S NOT MASSIVE IN FACT IT'S VERY VERY SMALL 
BUT UM YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY 
THIS IS A COTTAGE AND IN TERMS OF USE YES YOU COULD LIVE HERE 
BUT I RECKON GIVEN ITS LOCATION PERFECT HOLIDAY LET 
I'VE ARRANGED FOR A LOCAL EXPERT WITH THIRTY YEARS' EXPERIENCE 
OF THE REGION TO CAST HIS EYES OVER MILL COTTAGE 
IT'S IN A VERY QUIET LOCATION HERE IT'S DOWN A LITTLE PRIVATE LANE 
YOU'VE GOT A FIELD PLUS THE RIVER AT THE END OF THE LANE 
LOTS OF WOODLAND AND PRETTY SCENERY AROUND IT 
MILL COTTAGE WAS GUIDED AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
SO WHAT'S THE INCOME POTENTIAL THAT IT COULD PRODUCE 
THE RENTAL VALUE FOR A PROPERTY LIKE THIS 
WOULD BE IN THE REGION OF SIX HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED FIFTY A MONTH 
IF THE NEW OWNER WERE JUST TO DO THE PLACE UP AND SELL IT ON 
HOW MUCH COULD THE COTTAGE THEN BE WORTH 
IF THE PROPERTY WERE REFURBISHED TO A GOOD STANDARD 
I FEEL THE VALUE WOULD BE IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T KNOCK THE LOCATION 
AND THE HOUSE ITSELF WELL PRETTY VERSATILE 
YOU COULD LIVE IN IT OR YOU COULD RENT IT OUT TO HOLIDAYMAKERS 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT IT WENT FOR AT THE AUCTION 
WE'VE GOT AN ATTRACTIVE PROPERTY HERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
LOT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE WHICH IS THE SEMI DETACHED COTTAGE 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY LET'S GET STARTED 
SURELY WE'RE NOT GOING TO START ANY LOWER THAN THAT FOR A LOVELY COUNTRY COTTAGE IN THE WYE VALLEY

HAVE YOU ALL DONE I'M NOT GONNA DWELL 
AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
IT'S YOURS SIR THANK YOU 
THAT SUCCESSFUL BID OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR MILL COTTAGE WAS MADE BY COLIN 
HE LIVES IN HEREFORDSHIRE AND ALTHOUGH HE HAS RESTORED PROPERTIES IN THE PAST 
THE LAST ONE WAS TWO YEARS AGO 
HIS SISTER JENNY IS KEEN TO LEARN SOME TIPS 
RIGHT COME ON IN JEN WOW 
THIS IS A LITTLE DEN I'VE BOUGHT 
I LOVE THE WOODEN STAIRCASE YES 
I MET UP WITH THEM BOTH AT MILL COTTAGE TO FIND OUT WHY THEY DECIDED TO BUY IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY 
AND WHY THEY CHOSE THIS PROPERTY 
SO WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU FIRST SAW THIS PLACE 
I JUST LIKED THE LOOK OF IT 
IT LOOKS NICE NICE SETTING NICE AREA 
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE KEYS TILL THE MORNING OF THE AUCTION DID WE NO WE HADN'T SEEN INSIDE IT AT ALL 
WE'D ONLY SEEN IT IN THE BROCHURE I LIKED IT STRAIGHT AWAY 
I LIKE THE COTTAGE FEEL I LIKE COTTAGES PERFECT PERFECT 
SO IN TERMS OF THE AREA WHAT WAS IT THAT APPEALED TO YOU ABOUT THE AREA 
WITH THE TINTERN ABBEY AND STUFF 
I KNOW IT VERY WELL IT'S BEAUTIFUL AROUND HERE 
YES THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF WALKS AROUND HERE SO I THOUGHT IT'S GOT POTENTIAL 
JUST TO LIVE HERE AND WORK AND THIS HOLIDAY TYPE THING 
SO YOU COULD RENT IT OUT YES THAT'S MY THOUGHTS 
FLUFFY'S FINE IT'S EARLY DAYS YES 
COLIN HAS MOVED BACK IN WITH HIS PARENTS AND RENTS OUT HIS CURRENT HOUSE 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF DAMP THROUGH THE WALLS BUT NOT TOO SERIOUS BATHROOM IN THE OTHER ONE 
ALTHOUGH COLIN'S REFURBISHED PROPERTIES IN THE PAST HE DOES IT MORE AS A HOBBY THAN A BUSINESS 
BUT WHAT ABOUT JENNY 
I'M INTERESTED IN PROPERTIES MYSELF BUT UM I'M JUST SEEING IF I CAN LEARN ANYTHING 
BY PAIRING UP WITH COLIN POSSIBLY 
THIS IS YOUR FIRST EXPERIENCE OF BUYING AT AUCTION YES SO I'M 
I'M JUST SEEING IF I CAN LEARN ANYTHING 
SO ARE YOU GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT I WILL BE DOING SOMETHING 
I'M SURE COLIN WILL GET ME TO DO SOMETHING I'M SURE HE'LL FIND SOMETHING FOR ME TO DO 
LENDING ME SOME MONEY WILL HELP 
WELL SO MUCH FOR BROTHERLY LOVE 
BUT I'M SURE JENNY WILL PICK UP SOME NEW SKILLS WHEN COLIN STARTS WORK ON RENOVATING THIS LOVELY COTTAGE 
WHAT ARE THE PLANS WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO 
UM HOPE TO A PARKING SPACE OUT THE FRONT 
I FEEL THERE'S TOO MUCH SHADE ON THE WINDOWS THAT NEEDS A GOOD SORTING OUT 
SO TREES THEN YES AND SHRUBS AND STUFF 
INSIDE WE GET THE DAMP SORTED OUT 
THERE'S A BIT OF BOUNCE IN THE CEILING SO WE'LL SORT THAT OUT 
KITCHEN 
THE KITCHEN'S PRETTY GOOD AT THE MOMENT 
STILL QUITE NICE 
A TABLE IN THIS ROOM 
KEEPING THIS KITCHEN WILL HELP KEEP THE BUDGET DOWN AND LESSEN THE WORKLOAD 
IN FACT JENNY WAS SURPRISED AT HOW LITTLE THEY'D HAVE TO CHANGE 
ACTUALLY I WAS QUITE SHOCKED THAT THE KITCHEN WAS SO NICE 
AND THE BATHROOM THERE'S NO NEED TO TOUCH IT REALLY THE UNITS ARE FINE PERFECT 
THERE'S NO GAS CONNECTED TO THE PROPERTY IS THERE NO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET AROUND THAT 
I'LL PUT OIL FIRED CENTRAL HEATING IN WHICH I FEEL IS BETTER THAN THESE ELECTRIC HEATERS 
THEY'RE EXPENSIVE 
COLIN PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR MILL COTTAGE 
JENNY'S RIGHT THE KITCHEN AND BATHROOM NEED VERY LITTLE ATTENTION 
SO PROVIDING NO MAJOR PROBLEMS ARE UNCOVERED THERE SHOULDN'T BE MAJOR EXPENDITURE HERE 
NOW IN TERMS OF UM SORT OF THE FINANCES ON THIS WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND 
TEN 
EIGHT OR TEN AND TIMESCALES 
IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER WE CAN GET PEOPLE SORTED OUT 
YOU MEAN BUILDERS AND STUFF UM YEAH 
THE HELP THAT I NEED COS IT DOESN'T ALWAYS GO TO PLAN DOES IT NO 
SO YOU KNOW I'M HOPING SIX WEEKS REALLY OOH 
UM YOU KNOW I'D BETTER SAY TWO MONTHS 
WHAT'S THE BIGGER PICTURE PLAN FOR THE HOUSE 
ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT UP SELL IT ON RENT IT OUT WHATEVER 
GET IT DONE FIRST AND THEN WE GO FROM THERE 
WE'LL EITHER DECIDE TO PUT IT STRAIGHT ON THE MARKET OR LIVE IN IT FOR A WHILE 
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU COULD HAVE A BATTLE IN TERMS OF WHO LIVES HERE SOUNDS LIKE JENNY WANTS TO I DO 
IT'S MY PERFECT PLACE I'LL CHARGE YOU A BIG RENT 
YOU BIG MEANIE WHAT DO YOU MEAN CHARGE HER A BIG RENT 
SHE'S YOUR SISTER 
YEAH PRECISELY YOU SHOULD BE REALLY NICE TO ME 
YEAH COME ON COLIN KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY 
YOUR SISTER WANTS TO LEARN YOUR TIPS BUT WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT 
TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH RENOVATION THEY DECIDE TO DO 
WELL IT SEEMS THAT COLIN HAS REALISED THE TRUE POTENTIAL OF THIS PLACE 
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT HE COULD DO WITH IT 
AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THE ONLY CHALLENGE HE FACES IS THAT WHATEVER HE DECIDES TO DO 
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO NEGOTIATE HARD WITH HIS SISTER FIRST 
FIND OUT WHAT THEY GET UP TO LATER IN THE SHOW 
DOING UP A PROPERTY CAN BE TIME CONSUMING AND VERY EXPENSIVE 
HAVE THE NEW OWNERS MANAGED TO STICK TO THEIR TIMESCALES AND THEIR BUDGETS 
LET'S FIND OUT 
BACK ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT THIS TIMBER FRAMED HOLIDAY HOME OVERLOOKING THE SEA 
FAILED TO MEET ITS RESERVE PRICE AT THE AUCTION AND WAS WITHDRAWN 
BUT AFTERWARDS NEIL AND HIS BROTHER MARK MADE A SUCCESSFUL OFFER OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
AND BECAME THE PROUD NEW OWNERS 
THEY'RE BOTH SUCCESSFUL PROPERTY DEVELOPERS BUT THIS PURCHASE WAS FOR PLEASURE NOT BUSINESS 
THEY'RE PLAN WAS TO DO IT UP GET A BOAT SAIL ACROSS THE SOLENT AND USE IT AS A FAMILY HOLIDAY HOME 
AND NOW THAT THE WORK'S FINISHED WE'VE SAILED BACK TO SEE WHAT HAS CHANGED 
IT ALL STARTS DOWN ON THE BEACH WHERE THERE'S NOW A TERRACED GARDEN 
THE OLD SUN DECK HAS BEEN CLEANED UP AND FINISHED OFF 
INSIDE WELL THE CONSERVATORY IS NOW A SIMPLY STUNNING PLACE TO SIT AND WATCH THE SHIPS SAIL BY 
THE VAST OPEN PLAN KITCHEN HAS BEEN FITTED TO A VERY HIGH STANDARD 
AND JUST LOOK AT THAT LOUNGE 
THE SPACE HAS ALL BEEN USED VERY WELL 
AND EXTRA BEDROOMS HAVE BEEN CREATED 
UPSTAIRS THAT WIDE CORRIDOR HAS BEEN REDUCED AND THE FIRST BEDROOM IS NOW A LIGHT BRIGHT DOUBLE 
THAT SHOCKING PINK ROOM HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO THE MAIN BATHROOM 
AND ALSO AN ENSUITE FOR THE MASTER BEDROOM 
THE HOUSE JUST FEELS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE CARIBBEAN IT'S SUPERB 
IT'S A REMARKABLE TRANSFORMATION ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING IT LOOKED ALMOST READY FOR DEMOLITION 
WE CONSIDERED A REBUILD HERE 
BUT WHEN WE LOOKED INTO WHAT WE ALREADY HAD WE FELT THERE WAS ENOUGH SPACE WITHIN THE EXISTING BUILDING 
THAT WE COULD THAT WE COULD USE 
O. K. WE'VE NARROWED THIS LANDING HERE WHICH HAS ALLOWED US TO MAKE THIS BEDROOM BIGGER 
MADE THE SPACE HERE MUCH BIGGER 
AND THAT'S ENABLED US TO TAKE THE BATHROOM HERE INTO HERE 
AND THAT MEANS WE'VE GOT A GREAT BIG MASTER BEDROOM WITH LOVELY VIEWS OVER THE SEA 
AND WE'VE STILL GOT A LITTLE BIT OF ROOM SO WE'VE MANAGED TO PUT AN ENSUITE THERE 
MAKING THE MOST OF THAT SEA VIEW WAS HIGH ON THE AGENDA DOWNSTAIRS AS WELL 
WHEN WE FIRST LOOKED AT THE BUILDING WE WERE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT YOU COULDN'T SEE THE VIEW 
BECAUSE THERE WAS A WALL HERE WITH SORT OF PIECEMEAL DOORS HERE 
SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE OPENED IT UP TOTALLY 
PUT AN RSJ IN STRENGTHENED IT JUST REALLY SO YOU COULD GET THE FABULOUS VIEW THERE 
FROM WHEREVER YOU WERE THE KITCHEN THE DINING ROOM OR SITTING HERE 
WE RAISED THE FLOOR SO THERE WAS A CONSISTENT FLOOR RUNNING THROUGH TO GIVE IT A NICE FEEL 
AND WE'RE REALLY PLEASED 
THE BROTHERS ARE EXPERIENCED DEVELOPERS AND FOR THIS INVESTMENT ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT 
THEY USED THE SAME BUILDERS THEY WORK WITH ON THE MAINLAND 
HOW'S THERE BUDGET STOOD UP 
THE BUDGET ORIGINALLY WAS FIFTEEN THOUSAND TO TWENTY THOUSAND AND IT'S GONE UP TO FORTY THOUSAND 
BUT WE'VE GOT A LOT MORE OUT OF IT THAT INCLUDES THE FURNISHING COSTS 
WHAT WE CHOSE TO DO WAS TO GO THAT LITTLE BIT FURTHER 
WE FELT THE MONEY SPENT WOULD BE REFLECTED ON THE END VALUE 
THE OVERALL EFFECT IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
IT'S CERTAINLY NO SEASIDE SHACK ANY MORE IT'S MORE LIKE A LUXURY BEACH HOUSE 
IS THAT THE EFFECT THEY WERE TRYING TO CREATE 
AND ARE THEY PLEASED WITH THE FINISHED PRODUCT 
WE WANTED A NEW ENGLAND STYLE 
I THINK WE ACHIEVED THAT 
THAT'S REALLY JUST THE COASTAL FEEL WE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS PERFECTLY SUITED FOR THAT 
I THINK WE'VE ACHIEVED THAT 
I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD 
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A NEW ENGLAND 
INITIALLY THE HOUSE WAS GOING TO BE JUST FOR FAMILY USE 
BUT NOW IT'S FINISHED THEY INTEND TO REAP SOME FINANCIAL REWARDS FROM THEIR INVESTMENT 
WE WILL STILL VISIT IT WE WILL STAY HERE BUT WE WANT TO GET RENT FROM OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL 
I'M SURE THEY'LL HAVE PLENTY OF INTEREST FOR HOLIDAY RENTS 
SO LET'S FIND OUT WHAT LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS FAMILIAR WITH THE ISLE OF WIGHT MARKET 
THINK OF THE POTENTIAL HERE 
THIS PROPERTY HAS BEEN FINISHED TO A VERY VERY HIGH STANDARD 
FROM SEEING IT BEFORE TO SEEING IT NOW IT'S PRETTY SPECTACULAR 
THE LAYOUT IS ABSOLUTELY SUPERB FOR THE USAGE 
PEOPLE LOVE OPEN PLAN LIVING 
THERE'S A GUEST BEDROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR AND THE TWO MAIN BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS SO IT'S PERFECT 
THE VIEWS HERE ARE ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
THIS IS GOING TO BE WHAT SELLS THIS PROPERTY 
MY FAVOURITE PART OF THE PROPERTY IS THE VIEW 
I THINK YOU COULD WASTE HOURS LOOKING OUT ACROSS THE SOLENT AND EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON WITHIN IT 
INCORPORATING THE CONSERVATORY INTO THE MAIN BODY OF THE HOUSE WAS A FANTASTIC IDEA 
IT'S BROUGHT THE SEA TO YOU 
A PERFECT PLACE TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL 
BUT HOW MUCH WOULD HOLIDAY MAKERS BE PREPARED TO PAY 
FOR ONE WEEK IN SUCH A LOVELY LOCATION 
ON A HOLIDAY LET BASIS 
I'D IMAGINE THIS PROPERTY WOULD FETCH SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVEN HUNDRED AT LOW SEASON 
AND ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AT HIGH SEASON PER WEEK 
LOW SEASON FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY PER WEEK 
GOING UP TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED A WEEK IN THE HIGH SEASON 
WE'D HOPED TO GET AT LEAST ER ONE THOUSAND A WEEK IN THE HIGH SEASON 
SO GETTING UP TO THAT SORT OF LEVEL I THINK REFLECTS WHAT WE'VE DONE 
WHICH IS NICE 
THAT IS VERY VERY GOOD TO HEAR 
YEAH EXCELLENT 
WHAT A RESULT 
A GOOD INCOME AND A GREAT RETREAT TO USE FOR THEMSELVES 
BUT HAS THEIR HARD WORK PRODUCED ANY CAPITAL GAIN 
THEY PAID TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND FOR THE HOUSE AND HAVE SPENT FORTY THOUSAND ON IT 
SO HOW MUCH IS THIS SEAFRONT HOUSE WORTH NOW 
IF I WAS TO PUT THIS PROPERTY UP FOR SALE 
I'D HAVE NO HESITATION IN MARKETING IT AT THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
IF THE PROPERTY WAS TO COME ONTO THE MARKET AT THE MOMENT 
WE'D SUGGEST AN ASKING PRICE OF AROUND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND 
A PROFIT OF WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
NICE WORK GUYS 
PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE HAD IN MIND YEAH 
WE FELT WORST CASE SCENARIO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY AND MAYBE OVER FOUR HUNDRED SO 
NO THAT'S GOOD NEWS 
WE HAVE OTHER PROPERTY ON THE ROAD 
AND THE PLAN IS TO DO THEM UP IN A SIMILAR WAY 
THERE ARE SOME TIRED BUILDINGS HERE 
AND IF WE CAN DO THIS THERE THEN IT'LL LIFT THE WHOLE THING 
AS THEIR PROPERTY PORTFOLIO ON THE ISLAND GROWS 
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND MORE TIME KEEPING AN EYE ON IT 
AND THEY'VE GOT THE IDEAL WAY TO COMMUTE 
THEY'VE BOUGHT THAT BOAT 
SO THE BROTHERS' TRIP ACROSS THE HIGH SEAS HAS LANDED THEM A GREAT PROFIT 
AND THEIR VERY OWN LUXURY BEACH HOUSE 
JUST UNDER SIX MONTHS AGO 
COLIN GOT A LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN 
WHEN HE BOUGHT THIS COTTAGE IN THE WYE VALLEY 
FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
HE PLANNED TO RENOVATE IT ALONG WITH HIS SISTER 
WHO'S KEEN TO PICK UP SOME DEVELOPING SKILLS HERSELF 
THE COTTAGE LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN RENOVATED RECENTLY 
BUT THERE WAS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT 
SO WHAT'S COLIN DONE SINCE WE MET 
I'VE MADE A MESS 
CLEANING UP THE TOWN BY THE BUS BOYS 
GONNA TELL YOU A STORY BOUT A LITTLE TOWN I KNOW 
HE'S NOT KIDDING THE COTTAGE HAS BEEN STRIPPED 
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A GREAT DEAL OF WORK STILL TO DO 
BUT WHAT HAS BEEN DONE 
WE'VE DONE THE DAMPCOURSE 
AND PUT IN NEW CEILING NEW FLOOR 
ONE BEDROOM'S EXTENDED A LITTLE BIT 
BECAUSE THE WATER TANK HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT 
ALL NEW ELECTRICS ALL NEW PLUMBING ALL NEW PLASTERING 
ALL ARTEX WILL BE PLASTERED AND JUST GENERALLY GO RIGHT THROUGH REALLY 
INSIDE THE LAYOUT REMAINS MOSTLY UNCHANGED 
COLIN STILL PLANS TO KEEP THAT KITCHEN 
UPSTAIRS THE ROOMS WILL REMAIN AS THEY ARE 
BUT HE HAS DONE SOME WORK IN THE BATHROOM 
THERE WASN'T A SHOWER THERE BEFORE 
UM IT WAS JUST A SHOWER OVER THE BATH 
WHICH IS NOT VERY HANDY WHEN THE CEILING'S ONLY ABOUT TWO FOOT SIX 
YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO BE LYING DOWN TO HAVE A SHOWER 
WELL COLIN ALSO PLANS TO REPLACE THAT STAIRCASE 
BUT THE BIGGEST CHANGE TO THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN OUTSIDE 
FIRST OF ALL IT WAS REALLY OVERGROWN 
AND YOU COULDN'T EVEN SEE THE HOUSE 
IT WAS VERY DARK 
SO WE JUST PUSHED OUT THE TREES 
THE WALL WAS FALLING DOWN 
SO WE'VE REBUILT THAT IN A DRY STONE WALL 
THE GUYS NEXT DOOR HAVE PUT IN THE NEW WALL THERE 
WHICH JUST SORT OF FINISHED IT OFF 
PUSHED OUT THE DRIVE AND MADE A COUPLE OF SPACES FOR CARS THAT'S ABOUT IT REALLY 
ORIGINALLY COLIN'S SISTER PLANNED TO HELP HIM WITH THE RENOVATION 
BUT AS IT'S BEEN THE ELECTRICS AND PLASTERING PHASE FIRST 
SHE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET STUCK IN YET 
I DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT IT 
BECAUSE UM I HAVEN'T DONE VERY MUCH AT ALL AT THE MOMENT 
BUT I WILL DO WHEN HE GETS TO THAT STAGE 
WHICH IS THE FINISHING TOUCHES 
UM MAYBE DECIDING WHAT DECOR TO HAVE OR WHATEVER 
I'LL HELP HIM THAT WAY 
I'LL HAVE TO BECAUSE HE'S COLOUR BLIND SO 
COLIN MAY BE COLOUR BLIND BUT HE DID SEE THE POTENTIAL 
OF BUYING THIS COTTAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
BUT THERE WAS MORE WORK TO DO THAN HE FIRST THOUGHT 
SO COUPLED WITH THE TIME IT'S TAKEN TO RENOVATE IT 
THAT MUST HAVE HAD AN IMPACT ON HIS BUDGET 
BE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR 
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY 
BUT HIS SISTER BELIEVES THAT COLIN HAS AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE 
FOR MAKING SURE THAT THIS PROPERTY GETS A FULL RESTORATION 
RATHER THAN A QUICK MAKEOVER 
I THINK HE'S FALLEN IN LOVE WITH IT 
HE'S BEEN WORKING HERE AND I THINK HE'S GETTING VERY ATTACHED TO IT 
SO HE'S DEFINITELY NOT GONNA SELL IT I'M SURE 
SO IT'S PROBABLY 
HE MAY EVEN LIVE IN HERE I'M NOT QUITE SURE REALLY 
YES I LOVE IT IT'S A REALLY NICE SPOT 
AND THE PEOPLE ARE BRILLIANT AS WELL 
IT SEEMS THAT THE WYE VALLEY HAS CAST ITS MAGIC SPELL 
COLIN HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE COTTAGE AND THE LOCALS 
THOUGH HE DOESN'T PLAN TO SELL HE COULD STILL MAKE MONEY FROM LETTING 
BUT HE'S GOT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET CARRIED AWAY ON THE RENOVATION 
ALTHOUGH IT'S HIS DREAM HOME HE PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR IT AT THE AUCTION 
AND SPENDING UPWARDS OF TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND ON RENOVATIONS 
COULD LEAVE HIM WITH NEGATIVE EQUITY 
LET'S ASK TWO LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS WHAT THEIR OPINIONS ARE 
I THINK THE PROPERTY HAS AN EXCELLENT LAYOUT 
YOU'VE GOT THE TWO BEDROOMS AND THE BATHROOM UPSTAIRS 
IT'S IN A BEAUTIFUL SETTING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE IN A QUIET VILLAGE 
BUT YOU'VE GOT ACCESS TO LOCAL AMENITIES AND MOTORWAY LINKS TO BRISTOL AND NEWPORT 
BY CREATING A DRIVEWAY THEY'VE GIVEN THE PROPERTY A REAL EDGE TO SELLING 
PARKING'S IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY IF YOU'VE GOT SPACE FOR TWO VEHICLES 
AND IN A VILLAGE LIKE LLANDOGO PARKING CAN BE A PREMIUM 
PROPERTY OF THIS TYPE IN THIS AREA IS RARELY SEEN ON THE MARKET 
SO WHEN IT DOES BECOME AVAILABLE WE DO FIND THAT IT'S VERY POPULAR 
TO GET IT TO FULL MARKET POTENTIAL I'D DO MORE COSMETIC WORKS INSIDE 
I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO CHANGE THE STAIRCASE 
AND I'D LOOK TO GET RID OF THE ARTEX CEILINGS 
COLIN STILL HAS ABOUT A MONTH OF WORK TO DO ON THE COTTAGE 
EVEN THOUGH HE'S FALLEN IN LOVE WITH IT 
COULD HE BE CONVINCED TO RENT IT OUT 
IF IT HAD GONE TO A CONVENTIONAL RENTAL BASIS 
WE'D BE LOOKING AT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE A MONTH 
I'D RECOMMEND A VALUE OF SIX HUNDRED FIFTY PER CALENDAR MONTH 
THAT SURPRISES ME REALLY 
TO BE HONEST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LESS THAN THAT 
SO FAR SO GOOD 
IT'S CERTAINLY GIVEN COLIN SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT 
BUT AFTER SPENDING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND ON THIS COTTAGE 
HAS HE INCREASED ITS VALUE 
IT IS DONE TO A GOOD STANDARD I'D MARKET THE HOUSE AT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WHEN COMPLETED I'D VALUE THIS PROPERTY AT ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE ON EACH OTHER 
YEAH THAT SOUNDS GOOD THAT SOUNDS ALL RIGHT 
I SPENT QUITE A BIT MORE ON IT THAN WHAT I ORIGINALLY PLANNED YOU SEE 
BUT IT'S ON THE PLUS SIDE INNIT IT'S ALL GOOD 
AFTER DEDUCTING FEES AND RUNNING COSTS 
THAT SHOULD LEAVE COLIN WITH A GOOD PROFIT 
BUT COULD HE BE TEMPTED TO CASH IN ON HIS HARD WORK 
AND MOVE ON TO ANOTHER PROJECT 
I DON'T THINK I COULD SELL IT IT'S SO NICE 
IT'S IN A WONDERFUL SPOT THIS NICE LITTLE PLACE TUCKED AWAY 
I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT I COULDN'T SELL IT 
WELL IT MAY NOT BE FINISHED 
AND IT'S PROBABLY GONNA COST HIM MORE MONEY 
BUT FOR COLIN IT'S ALL WORTH IT AS HE'S FOUND HIS DREAM HOME 
WE WILL HAVE MORE AUCTION PROPERTIES FOR YOU NEXT TIME 
WE WILL AND WE'LL SEE YOU THEN GOODBYE GOODBYE
