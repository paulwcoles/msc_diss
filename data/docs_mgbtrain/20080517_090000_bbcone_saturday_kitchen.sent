THAT IS NOT A ROAST CHICKEN BOY 
YOU CAN'T COOK THE PERFECT ROAST 
CHICKEN WHOLE THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE 
BECAUSE THE BREASTS ALWAYS COOK 
BEFORE THE LEGS L. SWEAR BY THAT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT I I KNOW FOR SURE I COOK THE PERFECT 
ROAST CHICKEN 
YOU ARE SAYING 
BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT TEXTURES 
OF THE LEG AND THE BREAST YOU 
DON'T AGREE 
YES THE BREASTS 
ALWAYS COOK BEFORE THE LEGS 
I SEE 
CAN'T YOU TAKE THE LEGS OFF AND 
ROAST THEM A BIT LONGER WHILE YOU 
EAT THE BREAST 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
YOU MIGHT AS WELL TAKE IT OFF AT 
THE BEGINNING AND ROAST IT 
SEPARATELY 
YOU ARE A CLASSICALLY SEPARATELY TRAINED CHEF YOU ARE NOT JUST A 
LITTLE BOY AROUND TOWN YOU HAVE 
WORKED SOME OF THE GREAT MASTERS 
CAN YOU CHOP THOSE 
YES SURE 
I WILL TAKE BIT TO STUFF THE BIRD 
YOU HAVE TRAINED WITH SOME OF THE 
GREATEST CHEFS IN THE COUNTRY IS 
IT TRUE THAT ACTUALLY IT WAS YOUR 
FATHER THAT PUT YOU IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION 
YEAH IT WAS WHEN I DIRECTION STARTED COOKING TWENTY YEARS AGO I 
WANTED TO WORK IN THE BEST POSSIBLE 
RESTAURANTS BACK THEN TWENTY YEARS 
AGO THE BEST RESTAURANTS IN 
BRITAIN WERE PREDOMINANTLY FRENCH 
RESTAURANTS LA GAVROCHE AND 
HARVEY'S 
WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME HARVEY'S PUT THE HERBS IN THERE 
SALT AND 
BUTTER IN THERE 
NO ONE EGG YOLK 
AND THEN THE HERBS GO IN 
THE VALUE 
IT'S ARE GOING IN 
THAT IS YOUR 
SAUCE YEAH 
MUSHROOMS YOU WANTED SAUCE YEAH TO WORK IN CLASSIC FRENCH FOOD 
YEAH I WANTED TO WORK IN THE BEST 
POSSIBLE RESTAURANTS L. WANTED TO 
WORK IN THE TOP MICHELIN STARRED 
RESTAURANTS BACK THEN IT WAS 
PREDOMINANTLY FRENCH HE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO EAT IN ALL 
THE DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS L. ASKED 
HISED VICE FOR WHERE I SHOULD WORK 
I ASKED HIS ADVICE FOR WHERE I 
SHOULD WORK BASICALLY YOU WORK IT 
SO IT IS LIKE A BREAD DOUGH IF IT 
IS TOO WET YOU ADD MORE FLOUR AND 
IF IT IS TOO DRY YOUED A MORE WATER 
YOU END UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REST IT FOR 
ABOUT AN HOUR VERY SIMPLY ROLL IT 
OUT TO HALF A CENTIMETRE IN 
THICKNESS 
IT IS A PASTRY CASING THICKNESS THAT WILL FLAVOUR UP THE CHICKEN 
YOU DON'T NEED ANY EXSES SALT ON 
THE CHICKEN BEFORE YOU PUT IT IN 
THE SALT CRUST 
DO YOU BAKE 
CHICKENS INSIDE THINGS IS THAT 
SOMETHING YOU DO 
I USED TO BAKE A 
CHICKEN IN CLAY IT IS FANTASTIC 
IT DOES KEEP IT MOIST AND THE 
FLAVOUR IT CANNOT ESCAPE ANYWHERE 
SO JUN IS RIGHT THE WAY HE COOK 
THE CHICKEN HE COOK PERFECT 
CHICKEN IT DOES NOT MEAN HE WILL 
COOK IT BETTER THAN ME 
LATER ON WE

WITH BLACK PEPPER YOU LITERALLY 
ROLL THE CHICKEN INSIDE THE 
PASTETRY LIKE THAT IF YOU ARE 
HAVING IN THE PASTRY LIKE THAT 
IF YOU ARE HAVING A DINER PARTY 
IMAGINE THAT IN FRONT OF YOUR

WINE REGULAR TO CUT THROUGH THE 
RICHNESS I WILL FINISH IT OFF WITH 
CREME FRESH 
WHY RATHER THAN CREAM 
IS IT A MORE STABLE SAUCE

PREFER THE FLAVOUR OF CREME FRESH

CLOCHERS CHARDONNAY BACK OF THE

SCREAMER INTO THE TOP CORNER FOR 
NON FOOTY FANS THAT MEANS VERY GOOD 
I LOVE THE DAZLING QUALITY FRUIT

SOME TIME IN THE SERIES BRIET TO 
US WRITE TO US WITH YOUR NAME 
ADDRESS AND HERE IT IS 
CARLUCCIO WILL MEET A WOMAN WHO 
LOVES BUTER MORE THAN JAMES MARTIN 
FIRST TIME TO CATCH ONE RICK STEIN 
HE IS ATTENDING A SCHOOL REUNION 
NOT ONLY DOES HE HAVE TO COOK FOR 
TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE BUT HE HAS TO MAKE A 
SPEECH AS WELL 
I DON'T LIKE LONDON THAT MUCH BUT I DO ENJOY GOING THERE FROM TIME TO TIME 
IT'S LIKE A COUNTRY MOUSE AND A TOWN MOUSE SORT OF SETUP 
I VOLUNTEERED TO DO THIS DINNER A REUNION DINNER FOR MY OLD SCHOOL UPPINGHAM 
AT THE LAW SOCIETY SOME TIME AGO SUDDENLY IT WAS ALL ON ME 
DO I LOOK O. K. 
CALM MY STOMACH IS GOING B. A. BOOM B. A. BOOM 
WE'RE ON HALF AN HOUR EARLIER THAN WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE 
TWO HUNDRED SIX PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE ARRIVING IN HALF AN HOUR 
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE ANYTHING IS SO THAT MAKES IT A BIT MORE TENSE 
I'M COOKING TURBOT WITH HOLLANDAISE SAUCE YESTERDAY THIS TURBOT WAS FLAPPING AROUND IN THE SEA 
WE'VE GOT SPINACH FROM COVENT GARDEN JUST STEAMING IT FOR ONE MINUTE 
BEFORE WE PUT THE TURBOT IN THE OVEN 
WE BROWN IT OFF ON TOP OF THE STOVE IN BUTTER SEASON IT WELL WITH BLACK PEPPER AND SEA SALT 
THIS CARAMELISES THE SURFACE 
GIVE IT A COUPLE OF MINUTES ON TOP OF THE STOVE THEN IN THE OVEN FOR ABOUT TEN 
THE FISH SOUP WAS MADE DOWN IN PADSTOW 
IT'S GOT VEGETABLES AND LOADS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF FISH PARTICULARLY CONGER EEL 
I'VE GOT TO SPEAK TONIGHT TO THIS GROUP OF MY OLD PUBLIC SCHOOL CHUMS 
SO I'M REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THAT THEY'RE ALL SOLICITORS AND DOCTORS 
I FEEL THAT THEY THINK BECAUSE I'M JUST A CHEF WHO'S HE 
LAST TIME THIS DINNER WAS ON IT WAS STEPHEN FRY 
SO I'M FOLLOWING HIM THE WHOLE THING IS DEEPLY STRESSFUL 
THE SECRET OF A GOOD HOLLANDAISE FOR TWO HUNDRED IS JUST THE SAME RULES AS FOR FOUR 
START OFF WITH EGG YOLKS A LITTLE BIT OF WATER TO MAKE IT EASIER TO WHISK 
WHISK OVER BOILING WATER UNTIL THE EGG YOLKS START TO THICKEN 
TILL YOU GET TO THE RIBBON STAGE WHERE THE WHISK IS MAKING RIBBON THICK SHAPES IN THE EGG 
THAT'S HAPPENING NOW ONCE YOU GET THERE YOU ADD CLARIFIED BUTTER 
I'VE GOT TO DO THREE LOTS LIKE THIS 
CHEFS DON'T NEED TO TAKE ANY EXERCISE 
ALL THE BUTTER'S IN NOW WE'VE GOT TO PUT IN LOTS OF LEMON AND CAYENNE PEPPER 
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TASTE THAT HEAT 
WE ARE REALLY IN TROUBLE IF WE DON'T GET A MOVE ON 
THINGS ARE GETTING TENSE HERE WE'RE PANICKING A LITTLE BIT 
AND YET WE THINK IT'S FUN WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT MANKIND THE HUMAN SPECIES 
GIVE THEM HELL AND THEY'LL LOVE IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I TOTALLY AGREE BOSS ANYTHING YOU SAY BOSS YEAH 
WITH THE SOUP WE'VE GOT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FRENCH BAGUETTE CROUTONS SCRUBBED WITH GARLIC 
COLIN IS HURRIEDLY SPREADING THE CROUTONS WITH ROUILLE 
WHICH IS A GARLIC MAYONNAISE FLAVOURED WITH CHILLI CORIANDER AND TOMATO 
WE'VE GOT TO HURRY NOW WE'VE GOT VIRTUALLY NO TIME 
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE NOW 
I HOPE IT'S IN THE CASE 
UM SHOULD YOU BE SEEING THIS 
AND I WAS THINKING EARLIER OF TYING A BOW TIE TONIGHT I MUST BE ROUND THE BEND 
I BOUGHT WHERE IS IT I BOUGHT A CLIP ON ONE IT COST EIGHTEEN QUID 
EIGHTEEN QUID 
HOW DOES IT WORK 
THE SPEECH IS GOING THROUGH MY MIND 
I'M GONNA TELL THEM THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT RUNNING A RESTAURANT THEY WANT TO BE 
I THINK THEY WANT TO BE CONGRATULATED ON BEING INTERESTED IN FOOD 
A LOT OF ENGLISH PEOPLE NOW ARE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE SO KEEN ON FOOD WHEREAS THEY WEREN'T BEFORE 
I'M GONNA TELL THEM THAT THE FACT THAT I'VE BEEN ASKED TO COME AND TALK TO THEM 
IS INDICATIVE OF HOW SERIOUSLY PEOPLE REGARD FOOD IN THIS COUNTRY 
HOW DOES THIS FIT ROUND A BIG NECK 
I'LL GO OUT THERE AND BE SO RELAXED THIS IS WHAT GOING OUT IN THE RESTAURANT AT HOME IS LIKE 
SOMETHING THAT ALISTAIR LITTLE SAID THAT WAS VERY FUNNY THE OTHER DAY 
WE WERE DEMONSTRATING I'D JUST COME OFF AND I TOLD HIM IT WAS A BIT NERVE WRACKING 
I SAID GOT EVERYTHING HE SAID YES MY KNIVES APRON INCONTINENCE BAG AWAY WE GO 
YOU SAW THE MENU SELFISH SOUP 
THAT WAS THE HEADMASTER 
WE COOKED TWO HUNDRED SIX MEALS THAT NIGHT AND IT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS 
LARGELY I THINK AND THIS IS A CHEF'S TIP BECAUSE I CHOSE TURBOT COOKED ON THE BONE 
THE BONES HAVE A GELATINOUS QUALITY WHICH GIVES THE FLESH A MOISTNESS 
AND ALLOWS YOU TO COOK THE FISH A GOOD TIME IN ADVANCE 
I'M A BIT SENSITIVE ABOUT THE FACT THAT AS A GOOD EX PUBLIC SCHOOLBOY I'M A CHEF NO 
LET ME GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF WHY I THINK THIS 
A FEW YEARS AGO IN THE RESTAURANT THIS CHAP WHO WAS DEFINITELY AN EX PUBLIC SCHOOLBOY SAID 
HE SAID I LOVED THE LOBSTER IT WAS BRILLIANT 
BUT HOW DARE YOU CHARGE PRICES LIKE THAT FOR IT 
NORMALLY I'D SAY I'M SORRY IT'S THE PRICE OF MARINE DIESEL 
LOBSTER FISHING DIMINISHING RESOURCES ETC 
INSTEAD I THOUGHT NO 
I SAID WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING HE SAID I'M A SOLICITOR 
AND I SAID AND YOU'RE TALKING TO ME ABOUT PRICES 
IT CAN BE EXPENSIVE ANOTHER FLAT 
FRISH YOU CAN TRY AT HOME IS BRIL 
I HAVE 
RECIPE WHICH CAN BE COOKED 
ON THE BARBI IT IS COOKED INSIDE A 
BANANA LEAF 
YOU YOU HAD IT BEFORE 
I WAS IF THE 
B. A. NANA LEAF 
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL 
BRILL IT IS A FLAT FISH IT HAS A 
FILLET OFRPB THAT SIDE AND THAT 
SIDE YOU END UP WITH WONDERFUL 
WHITE FILLETS HERE WHICH I HAVE 
TAKEN THE SKIN OFF L. WILL SERVE 
THAT WITH A DRESSING MADE WITH SOME 
SARKI SESMI SAUCE IT IS ASIAN IN 
FEEL AND FLAVOUR BASIL AND THYME 
GINGER SPING ONIONS AND CARROT 
THE IDEA IS IT COOKED TOGETHER AS A 
SIMPLE PARCEL AND STEAMS WHILE I 
MAKE IT UP YOU OF COURSE WERE 
INVOLVED IN WHAT I SAY WAS THE 
ROCK'N'ROLL OF COMEDY 
YEAH 
DO YOU SORT OF MISS THOSE BIG YEAH HEADY DAYS THOSE EXTRAORDINARY 
WILD WAYS NOW YOU ARE SETTLED DOWN 
AND BEING AN AUTHOR SERIOUS SERIOUS AUTHOR L. DON'T MISS THEM I WISH I 
PAID MORE ATTENTION AT THE TIME 
WE WERE SO ARROGANT EVERYTHING 
ELSE WASN'T YOU THOUGHT YEAH I'M 
MAKING A T. V. SHOW THEY ARE CLEARING 
THE SCHEDULES YOU DIDN'T START TO 
APPRECIATE PRECISELY WHAT WAS GOING 
ON L. THINK NOW I HAVE GOT VERY FEW 
MEMORIES SOMETHING LIKE I HAVE GOT 
ONE ABOUT A STICK AND ANOTHER 
ABOUT SOME KEYS THAT IS IT REALLY 
I WISH I'D PAID MORE ATTENTION AT 
THE TIME 
THAT IS ALL OF US IN LIFE 
ISN'T IT WE HAVE A BOWL AND SOME 
JAPANESE RICE WINE SESMI OIL NOT 
TOO MUCH NOW THE VEGETABLES NEED 
TO GO ON 
I WILL CONCENTRATE A BIT OTHERWISE 
I MAY HURT MY FINGERS SHRED IT 
THINLY YOU ARE AN AMBASSADOR FOR 
LIVERPOOL THE CULTURAL CITY 
CAPITAL OF CULTURE 
TELL ME YOU 
MUST BE PROUD OF THAT 
I HAVE JUST 
MADE THREE DOCUMENTARYS ALEXEI 
SAYLE'S LIVERPOOL WHICH GOES OUT 
ON THE B. B. C. THAT IS THE 
CONTRIBUTION ME GOING AROUND 
FRIGHTENING PEOPLE IT WAS A 
WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY ALTHOUGH I 
HAVE BEEN BACK TO LIVERPOOL MANY 
TIMES OVER THE YEARS THIS WAS THE 
FIRST TIME I HAVE SPENT THREE OR 
FOUR MONTHS THERE SINCE I LEFT L. 
DIDN'T WHEN I STARTED I THOUGHT 
JUST IT IS JUST ANOTHER FILM I AM 
MAKING BUT I FOUND IN SPENDING 
THAT MUCH TIME IN MY HOME CITY HOW 
MUCH IT MEANT TO ME 
HAS IT CHANGED 
A HUGE AMOUNT SINCE YOU WERE A 
CHILD GROWING UP 
MASSIVELY WHEN I 
WAS GROWING UP IT WAS STILL A 
COMPLETE VICTORIAN CITY REALLY 
THEN THE KIND OF CITY COUNCIL IN 
THE SIXTIES DECIDED IT WOULD BE A GOOD 
IDEA IF THEY DEMOLISHED EVERYTHING 
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE BEING A RESIDENT 
OF HIROSHIMA EVERYTHING BETWEEN MY 
HOUSE AND RIVER WAS DESTROYED L. 
INTERVIEW MY WIFE SHE LIVED OFF A 
ROAD AND HER AREA WAS FLATENED AND 
THEY WERE MOED TO A TOWER BLOCK 
THAT HAS GIVEN ME I AM A HERITAGE 
NAZI NOW TO HAVE THE WHOLE CITY 
REMOVED WAS A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE 
IT HAS TAKEN A LONG SOMETIME FOR 
A LONG TIME FOR LIVERPOOL TO 
RECOVER FROM THAT NOW THE CITY 
CENTRE IS FULL OF CONFIDENT 
IT IS 
HUGELY VIBRANT NOW 
INCREDIBLE BARS 
I HAVE CARROTS BASIL THYME

FISH 
THE IDEA IS ALL THE FLAVOURS FISH COME OUT WE HAVE THE FISH ON THE 
BANANA LEAF WE PUT THE VEGETABLES 
IN THE MIDDLE WITH THE SAUCE L. 
THINK IT LOOKS GOOD BUT HEY IT'S 
MY COOKING

COOKED IN CURRY PASTE COOKED IN 
COCONUT MILLMENT AND LIME PICKLING 
IT IS LEFT TO SIMMER 
GARLIC AND CHILE ON TOP OR FOOD 
HELL CUSTARD OVER PUFF PASTRY 
BAKE IT UNTIL IT IS CRISP AND GOLD 
ZERED WITH CLASSIC STRAW BERRY 
ROMANOFF WHAT DO YOU THINK WHICH 
IS YOUR FAVOURITE 
STRAW BERRY 
I LIKE IT IT'S A FLOP OF FRUIT 
GENNARO HAS SUER SWORDFISH RECIPE 
FOR US 
FIRST TIME FOR INDIAN FOOD FROM 
ANJUM ANAND TODAY SHE IS COOKING 
SPICY LAMB BURGERS FOR LADS TO 
ENJOY DURING THE CUP FINAL 
THIS WEEK I'VE PERSUADED AN OLD FRIEND TO GIVE UP HIS TAKEAWAY 
AND COOK AN INDIAN FEAST FROM SCRATCH 
FOR A BUNCH OF MATES COMING ROUND FOR THE CUP FINAL 
WE'LL PREPARE MOST OF THE DISHES IN ADVANCE 
SO WE CAN QUICKLY COOK THEM AT ALEX'S PLACE JUST BEFORE THE MATCH 
FRESH GINGER GARLIC CORIANDER AND ONIONS ARE GOING TO BE CHOPPED 
THEN MIXED WITH LAMB MINCE AND BREADCRUMBS TO MAKE THE BURGERS 
WILL YOU PEEL THE ONION AND THEN WE'LL PROCESS EVERYTHING TOGETHER 
I DON'T MIND CHOPPING HERBS I FIND IT RELAXING 
MY GRANDMOTHER IN ITALY USED A MEZZALUNA 
IT'S A THING YOU CHOP EVERYTHING FINELY WITH WHICH TOOK FOR EVER 
THERE GOES MY CORIANDER I'LL TAKE SOME GREEN CHILLIES 
TO ADD INTO IT 
AND THE ONIONS 
SO THIS COMES DOWN TO A VERY FINE PASTE 
NO I DON'T WANT IT TO BE A PASTE 
I JUST WANT IT TO BE ROUGHLY CHOPPED 
THAT'S PLENTY 
HOW EASY WAS THAT 
EXCELLENT JUST MIX IT ALL IN 
THEN I'LL PUT THE SPICES IN 
FOR THIS I'M ONLY USING GARAM MASALA AND CUMIN POWDER 
NOT EVERYTHING HAS LOADS OF SPICES IN IT 
YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW WHAT THIS IS BY SMELL 
GARAM MASALA IS A BLEND OF SPICES 
EACH COOK TENDS TO MAKE UP THEIR OWN MIX 
BUT THE READY MADE VERSION IS FINE TO USE 
IT HAS A MILD AROMA YET PACKS A PUNCH 
VERY PEPPERY VERY AROMATIC 
THIS CUMIN POWDER IS REALLY EARTHY 
FULL OF PUNCH VERY MUCH 
I'M GOING TO PUT A LITTLE LESS THAN A TEASPOON OF CUMIN 
SOME SALT 
IF YOU CAN FETCH ME AN EGG 
WE'LL PUT IN OUR BREADCRUMBS DO YOU WANT TO GET YOUR HANDS IN THERE 
NEVER MIND THE LAMB BURGERS ALEX IS GOING FOR MAN BURGERS 
FOR ME THAT'S A BIT BIG THAT'S A BIT MASCULINE 
HONESTLY ARE YOU GOING TO EAT THAT MY FRIENDS WILL EAT IT 
THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW HOW MUCH SALT YOU HAVE IN IT 
IS COOKING A LITTLE BIT TRYING IT AND THEN YOU CAN SAY 
IF YOU WANT MORE CHILLI OR SALT 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE HERB YOGURT TO GO WITH IT 
YOGURT MINT CORIANDER 
COULDN'T BE SIMPLER 
I LOVE THE SMELL OF FRESHLY CUT HERBS 
IT'S A MAN SIZED PEPPER ALSO 
COOL 
YOU SEEM QUITE SURPRISED NO I AM SURPRISED 
YOU MADE THAT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE SO DELICATE 
THE PERCEPTION IS INDIAN SPICES HITTING YOU FULL ON 
BUT THE WAY TO EAT SPICES IS TO BRING OUT THE BEST 
OF THE INGREDIENT YOU'RE PUTTING IT WITH 
I USED GARAM MASALA AND CUMIN SO JUST TWO SPICES 
BUT THAT'S ENOUGH TO LIFT THE LAMB 
THIS UNSALTED WHITE CHEESE IS A BASIC INDIAN FOOD STUFF 
YOU MIGHT THINK IT TAKES HOURS TO PREPARE NOT SO 
YOU CAN MAKE A BLOCK OF FRESH PANEER IN JUST FORTY MINUTES 
IT JUST REQUIRES MILK NO SALT AND SOMETHING TO SOUR IT WITH 
THE MILK IS COMING UP TO THE BOIL 
ONCE IT STARTS RISING WHICH SHOULD BE SOON 
WE'LL ADD IN OUR YOGHURT 
WHAT WE'LL SEE HAPPENING IS THE MILK SOLIDS WILL COAGULATE 
THE WHEY WILL SEPARATE FROM IT AND THEN WE DRAIN IT 
YOU NEED JUST ENOUGH YOGHURT TO KIND OF CURDLE IT 
BUT NOT SO MUCH THAT YOU WANT TO GET IT SOUR 
BUT IT'S A FORGIVING DISH TO MAKE 
SOMETIMES THE YOGHURT ISN'T SOUR ENOUGH 
YOU CAN SEE ALREADY YOU'RE GETTING LITTLE LUMPS OF MILK SOLIDS 
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL 
I LOVE MAKING CHEESE I FEEL IF I CAN DO CHEESE I CAN DO ANYTHING

MEAT STOCK ANY WAY WE HAVE GOT 
OBVIOUSLY SOME OLIVE OIL SALT 
PEPPER LOTS OF GARLIC THERE IS A 
GRAPE TRACTOR STARTING UP BEHIND ME 
THE WHOLE ESSENCE OF LA MANCHA CAN 
BE SUMMED UP IN THIS LITTLE BOX

THE FABULOUS AND EXPENSIVE SAFFRON 
ON TWENTY THIRD SEPTEMBER EACH YEAR 
THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN MOTHERS 
UNCLES GRANDPARENTS GO AROUND THE

NOW ALL THE UNNECESSARY MOISTURE 
HAS GONE OUT OF THEM WE WILL ADD 
THE PREFRYED MEAT BEEF IN THIS 
INSTANCE YOU COULD USE PORK OR 
VEAL THEN WE HAVE A LOAD OF GARLIC THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS 
DISH IS THE POTATOES WHICH WERE 
HARVESTED UP THE ROAD FROM HERE 
YESTERDAY THEY ARE COLD RAW 
PEELED WITH THEIR WATER STRAIGHT 
INTO THERE 
THEN SOME LOVELY STOCK 
COVER THE POTATOES THIS IS AS I 
SAY A POTATO STOCK IT IS NOT A 
BEEF STEW THE LOVELY LUXURIOUS BIT 
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AFFORD TO PUT IN 
OF SAFFRON WHEN IT IS FINISHED IT 
SHOULD REFLECT THE COLOURS THE 
RUST REDS AND THE LA MANCHA 
LANDSCAPE AND THERE WE ARE THAT

COOK FOR ABOUT FORTY MINUTES NOW 
THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE IT IT WILL 
BE IN THE HANDS OF SMILING BUT

THIS DISH I AM REALLY PLEASED WITH 
IT REFLECTS THE AREA THE WONDERFUL 
SAFFRON BEEF GARLIC POTATOES IT 
IS WHOLESOME AND WONDERFUL 
I HAVE TO SERVE IT UP L. AM NERVOUS I AM CONVINCED BECAUSE IT IS A SPAN 
TAINOUS THING ON OUR PART THESE 
PEOPLE THINK WE ARE PLAYING A JOKE 
ON THEM AN ENGLISH MAN ARRIVES 
FROM A BIG COACH AND OFFERS TO COOK 
THEM LUNCH IN THE MIDDLE OF A 
VINEYARD THEY MUST THINK I AM 
BARKING MAD YOU KNOW IT MADE THEM 
LAUGH IF A GOOD HONEST PLATEFUL OF 
FOOD CAN PUT A SMILE ON SOMEONE'S 
FACE IT CANNOT BE BAD ALTHOUGH 
THEY REGARDED ME AS A BAD 
ENGLISHMAN IT IS NOT BAD 
ACCEPT OF COURSE I DID USE SALT 
THEY PREFERRED THE GRAVY OR SAUCE 
TO BE DRIER WHILE I WAS AT IT THEY 
THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MEAN WITH THE 
SPICES THEY ALL CAME BACK FOR 
SECONDS THEY DID THEY DID THEY 
REALLY DID 
THEY DON'T MAKE T. V. LIKE THAT ANY 
MORE RIGHT IT IS TIME TO TAKE A 
FEW OF YOUR CALLS EACH CALLER GETS 
TO SAY WHETHER THEY WANT ALEXEI TO 
HAVE HEAVEN OR HELL WHAT DO WE 
HAVE ON THE LINE EDWARD FROM 
LANCASHIRE WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION 
I HAVE SOME FACTORY GOUMEY WHICH 
IS PORK BELLY AM LOOKING FOR 
INSPIRATION ON HOW TO COOK IT 
CHEF'S FAVOURITE LOADS OF FLAVOUR 
IF IT IS A BLOCK PUT IT IN 
FREEZER CUT CUBES FRY THEM OFF 
UNTIL CRISPY ADD IT TO BROAD BEANS 
LEN FILLS SLICE IT AROUND SOME 
CHICKEN STUFF IT WITH PRUNES AND 
PUT IT IN THE OFEN 
IT BACON 
REALLY 
HEAVEN OR HELL AS I AM A REALLY PERSON FROM LIVERPOOL IT HAS TO BE 
HEAVEN HEAVEN THE 
QUESTION FOR US IS THE THE QUESTION IS 
I WANT TO HAVE A TROUT I WAS THINKING OF STUFFING IT HOW 
IS BEST TO COOK OR AND STUFF IT 
WITH 
THIS TIME OF THE YEAR I GO WITH FISHING OPEN IT IN THE MIDDLE 
DON'T REMOVE THE BONES N. A LITTLE 
BOWL MIX GARLIC CAPERS A LITTLE 
BIT OF OLIVE OIL LOTS OF HERBS 
CLOSE IT UP WITH A BIT OF STRING 
OLIVE OIL FRY OR BAKE WHEN IT 
COMES OUT IT IS DELICIOUS 
HEAVEN OR HELL FOR ALEXEI 
I THINK 
IT WILL BE HEAVEN FROM ME 
THANK YOU 
WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION 
WHEN SPICE 
IS ADDED TO FOOD IT IS WHEN THEY 
ARE COOKED OR LIKE FLOWERS DO THEY 
HAVE TO BE COOKED TO ACHIEVE THE 
PROPER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DISH 
FOR EXAMPLE COULD YOU PUT RAW 
CURRY POWDER IN A DIP WITHOUT ANY 
FORM OF COOKING 
I WOULDN'T ADVICE 
IT THE THING ABOUT SPICES IS THEY 
HAVE NATURAL OILS PUT HEAT TO THEM 
THE OILS COME OUT DO IT SEPARATELY 
IN A DRY PAN THEN ADD IT TO YOUR 
FOOD IT WILL TASTE SO MUCH BETTER 
HEAVEN OR HELL FOR ALEXEI 
IT WILL 
HAVE TO BE THE SAME AS EVERYBODY 
ELSE BUT HEAVEN FOR OLD ALEXEI
