FOR THE UN GATHERS THE CHIEFS OF 
ITS MOST IMPORTANT AGENCIES TO 
TACKLE THE GO THE GLOBAL FOOD 
CRISIS IT APPEALS HE APPEALS TO 
THE DONOR COUNTRIES TO GIVE MONEY 
AND NOT JUST MAKE PLEDGES WE SPEAK 
TO THE HEAD OF THE FOOD AND 
AGRICULTURE ORGANISATION KEY 
MAXIMISES FEARS OF GLOBAL 
INSECURITY OF THE FOOD SHORTAGES 
HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED QUEEN MAP 
I SAID THERE WOULD BE SOCIAL 
TENSION THEY WILL BE POLITICAL 
TURMOIL AND THE JOURNALISTS ASKED 
SHALL WE HAVE FOOD RIOTS AND I 
SAID YES 
FOR YEARS THE INTERNATIONAL FACE 
OF SADDAM HUSSEIN'S REGIME TODAY 
THE CIGAR SMOKING FLUENT ENGLISH 
SPEAKING TARIQ AZIZ WAS IN COURT AT 
THE START OF HIS TRIAL IN IRAQ 
POLICE SAY D. N. A. TESTS CONFIRMED 
JOSEF FRITZL FATHERED THREE 
CHILDREN WITH HIS DAUGHTER 
CHILDREN STRUGGLE TO GET AN 
EDUCATION IN CAMBODIA AS TEACHERS 
THREATEN TO GO ON STRIKE TO GET A 
DECENT LIVING WAGE 
TO THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN FOOD 
RIOTS IN SOME COUNTRIES AND WITH 
THE WORLD BANK TODAY WARNING THAT 
ONE HUNDRED MILLION COULD GO HUNGRY THE 
RISK OF MAUR IS CLEARLY GREAT 
THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN BAN KI 
MOON SET UP AN URGENT TASK FORCE TO 
GET COUNTRIES TO TAKE CONCERTED 
GLOBAL ACTIONS HE CALLED ON DONOR 
NATIONS TO MAKE UP A FUNDING GAP TO 
FUND PEOPLE GOING SHORT OF FOOD 
ONLY EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF PLEDGES HAVE 
BEEN MADE SO FAR THE UN WANTS TO 
BOOST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN 
THE MOST AFFECTED COUNTRIES WE 
WILL HEAR FROM THE HEAD OF THE FOOD 
AND AGRICULTURE ORGANISATION IN A 
MOMENT 
THE FOOD PRICE CRISIS HAS CROSSED 
EVERY BORDER IN THE WORLD UNITING 
THE HUMAN RACE IN FUNDAMENTAL WAYS 
SOLUTIONS WILL NEED TO BE GLOBAL 
AND A ROUTINE MEETING OF THE HEADS 
OF UN AGENCIES TURNED INTO A CRISIS 
SUMMIT AS THE WORLD COUNTS THE COST 
OF NOT ACTING ON EARLIER WARNINGS 
WE RISK THE SPECTRE OF WIDESPREAD 
HUNGER MALNUTRITION AND SOCIAL 
UNREST ON AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE 
THE WORLD HAS ASKED TO FIND ONE POINT SEVEN DOLLARS 
BILLION TO HELP FARMERS IN THE 
POOREST COUNTRIES TO BUY SEEDS AND 
FERTILISERS SINCE OTHERWISE THEY 
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLANT CROPS 
THE FIGURE IS ALMOST TWICE THE 
PRESENT ANNUAL BUDGET OF THE UN 
AGENCY THAT THE FOOD AND 
AGRICULTURE ORGANISATION THE 
PROBLEM IS A COMPLEX ONE INVOLVING 
CLIMATE CHANGE POPULATION GROWTH 
HIGHER DEMAND FROM RICHER ASIAN 
COUNTRIES BIOFUELS COMPETING FOR 
LAND USE AND THE STREET TRIES IN 
THE OIL PRICES THE SOLUTIONS WILL 
BE COMPLEX THERE IS TALK OF THE 
GREEN REVOLUTION FOR AFRICA 
SIMILAR TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF 
TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS HELPED ASIA 
FEED ITSELF 
WHEN ONE TALKS ABOUT A 
GREEN REVOLUTION FOR AFRICA ONE 
MUST DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE 
REVOLUTION IN SOUTH ASIA BECAUSE 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT IT 
MUST FOCUS ON THE VALUE CHAIN 
PROPERTY RIGHTS SEEDS FERTILISERS 
IRRIGATION SYSTEMS MARKETS ROADS 
BEHIND THE SCENES THERE IS 
DISAGREEMENT OVER THE ROLE OF 
SUBSIDIES SOME OF THE POOREST 
COUNTRIES INSIST THEY NEED TO 
SUBSIDISE THEIR FARMERS BUT 
NEGOTIATIONS TO BRING IN NEW TRADE 
RULES AND THE WORLD TRADE 
ORGANISATION MIGHT BE COMING TO AN 
END AFTER SEVEN YEARS AND THAT WILL 
MEAN A DEMAND IN SUBSIDY CUTS THE 
ROLE OF BIOFUELS IS ANOTHER 
CONTROVERSIAL AREA MORE COUNTRIES 
ARE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT 
THEIR BENEFITS BUT PRESIDENT BUSH 
HAS COME IN STRONGLY FOR THEM IT IT IS IN OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS THAT 
WE OUR FARMERS GROW ENERGY AS 
OPPOSED TO PURCHASING IT FROM PARTS 
OF THE WORLD THAT ARE RUN STABLE OR 
MAY NOT LIKE US ARE NOT STABLE 
THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME HAVE AN 
IMMEDIATE NEED FOR FUNDING THEY 
HAVE PLEDGES BUT ONLY A TINY AMOUNT 
EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS SO FAR PAID OR OF THE 
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THEY SAY THEY NEED TO 
COPE WITH THE EFFECTS OF THIS 
CRISIS THE HEAD OF THE WORLD BANK 
SAID PLEDGES DO NOT FEED HUNGRY 
MOUTHS MOUTHS THE GENERAL DIRECTOR OF THE FOOD 
AND AGRICULTURE ORGANISATION OF THE 
UN JACQUES DIOUF WAS AT THE 
SUMMIT IN SWITZERLAND THAT SET UP A 
TASK FORCE HE SPOKE TO WAS DURING 
THE MEETINGS AND TOLD US WHAT THEIR 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES WOULD BE TO 
US 
IT IS TO ENSURE CO ORDINATION US OF THE UN SYSTEM AND THE LEADERSHIP 
OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL SO THAT 
WE CAN ALL WORK IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY 
AND IN A COMPLEMENTARY WAY IN 
PARTICULAR IN PREPARING THE SUMMIT 
OF HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT 
WHICH EVERYONE HAS CALLED WITH A 
VIEW AS TO A DRESSING TO 
ADDRESSING THE MAIN ISSUES THE 
SHORT TERM MEDIUM TERM AND LONG 
TERM PROBLEMS WE ARE VERY VERY 
WORRIED ABOUT SEAT GROWING SEASON 
THAT HAS STARTED WITH THE PLANTING 
IN MARCH IT WILL GO ALL THE WAY TO 
JULY FARMERS IN DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES IN DEFICIT HAVE 
DIFFICULTY ACCESSING SEEDS 
FERTILISER ANIMAL FEED BECAUSE 
THE PRICES HAVE GONE UP THEREFORE 
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON INCREASING 
PRODUCTION AND ENSURING SUPPLY IN 
THE POOR COUNTRIES THEMSELVES IN 
THE DEVELOPING WORLD 
THAT IS A 
MEDIUM AND LONG TERM STRATEGY THE 
UN IS CALLING FOR HUNDREDS OF 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS NOW TO FEED 
PEOPLE ARTS DONOR COUNTRIES 
REMAKING THAT MONEY AVAILABLE 
ARE DONOR COUNTRIES 
THEY HAVE BEEN 
SOME COMMITMENTS THAT ARE 
ENCOURAGING THERE HAVE BEEN BUT 
PARALLEL TO THIS EFFORT TO FEED 
THOSE THAT ARE HUNGRY WE HAVE TO 
ENSURE THAT THERE IS PRODUCTION IN 
THOSE COUNTRIES ALREADY STARTING 
WITH THE PRESENT GROWING SEASON 
OTHERWISE IN FOUR MONTHS WE WILL 
BE BACK TO RUSHING AGAIN TO GET 
FROM A DATE FOOD AID YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE FOOD CRISIS 
THREATENS GLOBAL SECURITY AREN'T 
YOU BEING A BIT ALARMIST NO NO ALREADY IN OCTOBER ON THE FRENCH 
TELEVISION AND IN NEWSPAPERS I 
SAID THERE WOULD BE SOCIAL TENSION 
THERE WOULD BE POLITICAL TURMOIL 
THE JOURNALIST ASKED SHALL WE HAVE 
FOOD RIOTS I SAID YES AND WE HAVE 
SEEN THE FOOD RIOTS WE HAVE SEEN 
IT IN CAMEROON IN SENEGAL IN 
BURKINA FASO IN GUINEA ALSO IN 
INDONESIA AND SO ON IT IS A REALLY 
SERIOUS PROBLEM IF WE DO WHAT WE 
SHOULD DO WHICH HAS HELPED THOSE 
WHO ARE HUNGRY GET FOOD AT 
REASONABLE PRICES AND ALSO ENSURE 
THAT WE HELP THE FARMERS IN POOR 
COUNTRIES TO BE ABLE TO GROW FOOD 
FOR THE NEXT CAMPAIGN THE NEXT 
GROWING SEASON WITH THE NECESSARY 
SEEDS FERTILISER ANIMAL FEED 
THEN WE LOWER THE RISK OF MORE 
ATTENTION 
WE ARE HEARING CONCERNS ATTENTION ABOUT SOME COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY 
IN ASIA HOARDING FOOD AND BANNING 
THE EXPORT OF CROPS BECAUSE THEY 
WANT TO FEED THEIR OWN PEOPLE 
SURELY YOU CANNOT BLAME THEM FOR 
THAT 
I AM NOT BLAMING THEM I AM THAT SAYING THAT IF EACH COUNTRY ADOPTS 
ITS OWN CRISIS MANAGEMENT SOLUTION 
EACH OF THEM WILL BE INDIVIDUALLY 
ALL RIGHT BUT WHEN WE ADD THEM ALL 
WE HAVE THE WORLD SITUATION THAT IS 
WORSE WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE HEADS 
OF STATE TO GET TOGETHER 
FORTUNATELY I LAUNCHED THIS SUMMIT 
LAST HERE AND I GOT TO TEN BY THE 
CONFERENCE IN NOVEMBER TO RINSEY 
CONFERENCE OF THE F. A. O. I GOT IT 
LAUNCHED WE HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL 
FORUM WHERE WE DISCUSS ALL THOSE 
ISSUES AND WE TOOK MEASURES THAT 
WILL BE IMPORTANT NATIONALLY AND 
GLOBALLY FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM 
THERE ARE CRITICISMS THAT THE 
INCREASING USE OF BIOFUELS IS 
DIVERTING CROPS AWAY FROM FOOD 
PRODUCTION FIND EDGY DO YOU WANT 
TO SEE A MORATORIUM ON BIOFUELS 
UNTIL WE SEE A FURTHER GLOBAL 
REVIEW AWAY FROM FOOD PRODUCTION 
TOWARDS ENERGY 
WE NEED TO LOOK AT 
WHO IS SUBSIDISING AND TWO IS NOT 
THEREFORE WHO IS DISTORTING THE 
MARKET WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE 
BIOFUELS THAT BY USING FOOD 
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER BIOFUELS 
THAT ARE NOT USING FOOD WHAT IS 
THE SPECIFIC SITUATION OF EACH 
COUNTRY THAT IS PRODUCING THAT 
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SOME TECHNICAL 
COMMITTEES THAT MADE DOCUMENTS THAT 
WE HAVE SUBMITTED TO THE HEADS OF 
STATE IT IS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT THAT WAS JACQUES DIOUF HEAD OF THE FOOD 
AND AGRICULTURE ORGANISATION 
TALKING TO ME EARLIER 
THE MAN WHO WAS THE URBANE FACE OF 
SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS MY GOVERNMENT 
APPEARED IN COURT TODAY TARIQ AZIZ 
A FORMER DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER IS 
ACCUSED OF THE EXECUTIONS ACCUSED 
OF INVOLVEMENTS OF THE EXECUTIONS 
OF MARCH AND SUSPECTED OF 
PROFITEERING IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO HIS COUSIN 
KNOWN AS CHEMICAL ALI IS AMONG THE 
DEFENDANTS IT IS THE FOURTH TRIAL OF 
LEADERS IN SADDAM'S REGIME WE 
EXPECTED THE TRIAL TO START TODAY 
WHAT HAPPENED 
IT WAS DELAYED FOR A WHILE ALI 
HASSAN AL MAJID CHEMICAL ALI HE 
FELL ILL THIS MORNING AND THAT 
DELAYED PROCEEDINGS FOR A WHILE HE 
DID NOT TURN OUT TO COURT WHEN THE 
CASE BEGAN LATE AFTERNOON WHEN THE 
HEARING BEGAN ALL EYES WERE ON 
TARIQ AZIZ AS HE TOOK THE DOCK HE 
WAS THE FORMER PUBLIC FACE OF IRAQ 
TARIQ AZIZ ONCE COMMANDED THE 
ATTENTION OF WORLD LEADERS NOW IT 
IS A CRIMINAL JUDGE TO AS HIM 
ACCUSED OF COMPLICITY TO MURDER HE 
IS THE LATEST FORMER HIGH OFFICIAL 
IN SADDAM HUSSEIN'S CABINET TO 
ANSWER GRAVE CHARGES WHEN THE U. S. 
INVADED IRAQ HE WAS THE EIGHT OF 
SPADES IN THEIR WANTED PACK OF 
CARDS URBANE CULTURED AND 
COLOURFUL HE COULD CHARM AND HIS 
JOB WAS TO SELL SADDAM HUSSEIN'S 
POLICIES TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD HE 
ANSWERED TO NO ONE EXCEPT THE 
PRESIDENT PUTTING A SMOOTH GLOSS 
ON EVERYTHING THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT 
DID HE WAS HIS MASTER'S VOICE AND 
HE DID IT ALL IN PERFECT ENGLISH 
HIS LAST MISSION WAS TO HEAD OFF A 
U. S. INVASION 
I HOPE IT WILL NOT 
HAPPEN BECAUSE IT IS BAD FOR US 
FOR THE REGION AND FOR THE WORLD 
BUT THE DIPLOMAT WHO BECAME FOR 
SOME AN ELOQUENT AND EVEN LIKEABLE 
WINDOW ON A CLOSED NATION IS NOW 
FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE THIS IS 
BAGHDAD'S MAIN WHOLESALE FOOD 
MARKET IN NINETEEN NINETY TO MORE THAN FORTY 
MERCHANTS WERE ACCUSED OF HIKING 
PRICES AS INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS 
BEGAN TO BITE THEY WERE ROUNDED UP 
AND SUMMARILY EXECUTED TARIQ AZIZ 
IS CHARGED WITH BEING INVOLVED IN 
THAT DECISION TO KILL QASIM ARAB 
WAS ONE OF THOSE HANGED 
THEY TOOK 
MY FATHER WAY AROUND MIDDAY I 
ASKED WHERE THEY WERE TAKING HIM 
BUT THEY SAID THEY WOULD BRING HIM 
BACK I NEVER SAW HIM ALIVE AGAIN 
THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY TALES OF 
MURDER IN SADDAM'S IRAQ THE GLOBE 
TROTTING DIPLOMAT WHO DEFENDED HIS 
NATION IS NOW DEFENDING HIMSELF 
IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT ISN'T 
IT TO REALLY BRING EVIDENCE THAT 
LINKS TARIQ AZIZ PERSONALLY TO THE 
EXECUTIONS OF THE MERCHANTS I I THINK IT WILL BE DIFFICULT AND THAT 
IS WHAT A LOT OF OBSERVERS ARE 
SAYING TARIQ AZIZ WAS THE DEPUTY 
PRIME MINISTER HE WAS AT THE APEX 
OF THE GOVERNMENT AND WAS A MEMBER 
OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND 
COUNCIL THAT IN THE CABINET WAS 
BASICALLY THERE TO RUBBER STAMP THE 
DECREES OF SADDAM HUSSEIN OH 
THAT INNER CABINET THE PROSECUTION 
WILL ARGUE THAT HE WAS AROUND AND 
SIGNED THE DEATH WARRANTS OF THOSE 
FORTY TWO MERCHANTS AS A MEMBER OF THAT 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL UNLESS THE 
PROSECUTION PRESENT THE DECREE WITH 
HIS SIGNATURE RUN IT I THINK THERE 
WILL BE A LOT OF SCEPTICAL PEOPLE 
ON IT PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE 
SUNNI COMMUNITY THEY WILL BELIEVE 
THE TRIAL IS SIMPLY AN ACT OF 
REVENGE 
IT IS THE FOURTH TRIAL AND REVENGE TARIQ AZIZ WAS A CHRISTIAN BUT OUR 
PEOPLE IN IRAQ BEGINNING TO THINK 
THESE ARE TRIALS WHICH ARE LED BY 
THE SHIA MAJORITY GOVERNMENT 
AGAINST SADDAM HUSSEIN'S FORMER 
SUNNI IN A CIRCLE ALTHOUGH TARIQ 
AZIZ IS WAS A CHRISTIAN 
YES HE 
WAS A CHRISTIAN AND WAS NOT RELATED 
TO SADDAM HUSSEIN WHICH IS UNUSUAL 
FOR THE CIRCLE OF THE FORMER 
DICTATOR'S COLLEAGUES AND COM 
PATRIOTS BUT HE WAS PART OF A 
SUNNI DICTATORSHIP MANY SUNNI 
PEOPLE PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST 
TWO OR THREE YEARS FOLLOWING THE 
TRIALS AT THE IRAQI HIGH TRIBUNAL 
HERE HAVE BELIEVED THAT THIS HAS 
SIMPLY BEEN A FESTIVAL OF REVENGE 
BUT THE SHIA ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE ARGUMENT WERE LAPPING UP THE 
EVENTS ON TELEVISION TODAY THERE 
WAS A RECORDED FEET OF THE EVENTS 
IN THE COURT TODAY IT WAS STREAMED 
ON IRAQI TELEVISION AND MANY PEOPLE 
WILL HAVE WATCHED IT THE SHIA NEWS 
SAW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO 
SEE SOMEONE SO HIGH RANKING IN THE 
GOVERNMENT'S STANDING IN THE DOCK 
ANOTHER APPEARANCE IN COURT THIS 
TIME OF JOSEF FRITZL THE SEVENTY THREE YEAR 
OLD MAN IN AUSTRIA WHO HELD HIS 
DAUGHTER CAPTIVE AND FATHERED SEVEN 
CHILDREN FROM HER D. N. A. TESTS HAVE 
CONFIRMED THAT THE SURVIVING SIX 
CHILDREN HAD BEEN FATHERED BY HIM 
AUSTRIAN POLICE SAID HE HAD LEFT 
NOTHING TO CHANCE WHEN IT CAME TO 
DECEIVING EVERYONE AROUND HIM THE 
TWENTY FOUR YEARS HE HAD IMPRISONED HIS 
DAUGHTER AND SOME OF THE CHILDREN 
IN THE CELLAR OF HIS HOUSE FOR 
TWENTY FOUR YEARS ON THE BACK SEAT OF A 
POLICE CAR THIS IS JOSEF FRITZL 
HEAD COVERED BEING BROUGHT TO 
COURT AMID THE TIGHTEST SECURITY 
MOMENTS LATER HE IS JUST ABOUT 
VISIBLE THROUGH THE GATES ALLOWED 
OUT OF THE CAR HE PUTS ON HIS 
JACKET AND HIS LEAD INSIDE TODAY 
POLICE CONFIRMED THAT THIS SEVENTY THREE YEAR 
OLD RETIRED ENGINEER WAS THE FATHER 
OF HIS DAUGHTER'S CHILDREN THE THE RESULTS OF THE D. N. A. TESTS ARE THAT 
HE IS TRULY THE FATHER OF THESE 
SEVEN CHILDREN FROM HIS OWN 
DAUGHTER 
AT THE HOUSE FORENSIC DAUGHTER EXPERTS WILL BE SEARCHING FOR MORE 
EVIDENCE POLICE SAID THEY WERE 
EXAMINING OTHER PROPERTIES TOO 
LOOKING FOR MORE SECRET DUNGEONS 
BUT THEY THINK FRITZL WAS SO BUSY 
WITH HIS CRIME HERE IT IS UNLIKELY 
HE WAS ABLE TO DO ANYTHING SIMILAR 
ANYWHERE ELSE SO HOW COULD JOSEF 
FRITZL HAVE COVERED UP HIS CRIME 
FOR SO LONG POLICE SAY THE 
ENTRANCE TO FRITZL'S DUNGEON IS 
BEHIND A CONCEALED AND REINFORCED 
CONCRETE DOOR THE SELLER DESCENDED 
SO DEEP UNDERGROUND THAT EVEN THE 
LOUDEST CRY FOR HELP WOULD NOT HAVE 
BEEN HEARD FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS THIS 
NETWORK OF ROOMS WAS HOME TO 
FRITZL'S DAUGHTER AND THEIR 
CHILDREN POLICE BELIEVE HIS WIFE 
HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS HAPPENING WE WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT SHE KNEW 
ANYTHING ANYTHING WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE I 
REPEAT AND IT CONTRADICTS LOGICAL 
THINKING TO SAY THAT A MOTHER OF 
SEVEN WOULD HELP HER HUSBAND TO 
PRODUCE ANOTHER FAMILY WITH HER OWN 
DAUGHTER DAUGHTER AND WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN THEY 
ARE NOW BEING TREATED BY A TEAM OF 
DOCTORS AND PSYCHIATRISTS 
THE CHILDREN ARE QUITE WELL THEY 
ARE ERM UNDER INVESTIGATION AND 
ALSO THERE IS A PROFESSIONAL TEAM 
CONSISTING OF PSYCHIATRISTS OF 
NEUROLOGISTS OF PSYCHOTHERAPISTS 
AND DIFFERENT OTHER PROFESSIONS 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION 
TODAY THE AUSTRIAN AUTHORITIES 
REJECTED ACCUSATIONS THAT THE 
POLICE HAD BEEN TOO SLOW TO ACT 
I DON'T KNOW WHICH 
FAULT I HAVE MADE I AM REALLY 
SHOCKED ABOUT THIS CRIME WHAT 
SHALL I DO I DID NOT FIND FAULTS 
BUT MANY AUSTRIANS SUSPECT THAT 
OVER A QUARTER OF THE CENTURY 
MISTAKES WERE MADE BY THE POLICE 
BY SOCIAL SERVICES AND BY THE 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES MISTAKES THAT 
MADE THE NIGHTMARE OF THIS STREET 
LAST SO LONG 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE 
OTHER NEWS NOW A LOYAL FOR SOME 
TWO HUNDRED OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS DETAINED 
IN ZIMBABWE SAYS THE HIGH COURT 
ORDERED THE POLICE TO EITHER CHARGE 
OR RELEASE THE GROUP TWENTY EIGHT MILITIA 
FIGHTERS HAVE BEEN KILLED DURING 
BATTLES IN SADR CITY 
THE U. S. MILITARY SAID A NUMBER OF 
ITS SOLDIERS HAD BEEN WOUNDED 
ITALY'S NEW PARLIAMENT HAS CONVENED 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE SILVIO 
BERLUSCONI'S ELECTION VICTORY THE 
SENATE IS EXPECTED TO ELECT ITS 
SPEAKER ON WEDNESDAY MR. BERLUSCONI 
WON HIS THIRD PREMIERSHIP EARLIER 
THIS MONTH 
RESEARCHERS FROM AMERICA SAY 
CHILDREN WHO GO THROUGH NURSERY ARE 
THIRTY PER CENT LESS LIKELY TO DEVELOP 
LEUKAEMIA ONE THEORY IS THAT 
COUGHS AND SNEEZES SPREAD IN 
PLAYGROUPS HELP PRIMED A CHILD'S 
IMMUNE SYSTEM HERE TO TELL US MORE 
IS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT 
THIS IS WHAT LEUKAEMIA LOOKS LIKE 
MAGNIFIED MANY TIMES OVER IT IS A 
DEBILITATING AND SOMETIMES DEADLY 
CANCER THAT AFFECTS ONE IN TWO THOUSAND 
YOUNGSTERS THESE CHILDREN MAY 
UNWITTINGLY BE PROTECTING 
THEMSELVES FROM THE CONDITION 
RESEARCHERS COMPARED KIDS WHO GO 
OUT TO PLAYGROUPS WITH THOSE WHO 
STAY AT HOME AWAY FROM INFECTION 
THEY FOUND THE ONES WHO WENT OUT TO 
PLAY WERE THIRTY PER CENT LESS LIKELY TO 
DEVELOP LEUKAEMIA THE THEORY IS 
THAT CHILDREN LIKE THESE WHO GET 
LOTS OF EXPOSURE TO INFECTION HAVE 
THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS CHALLENGED AT 
A VERY EARLY AGE BUT KIDS WHO 
DON'T GET THAT AND WHO HAVE A 
PARTICULAR GENETIC MUTATION ARE 
FAR MORE VULNERABLE TO GOING ON TO 
DEVELOP LEUKAEMIA SCIENTISTS SAY 
TODAY'S FINDINGS BRING US A STEP 
CLOSER TO UNDERSTANDING THE DISEASE 
AND HOW TO PREVENT IT 
WE CAN BE QUITE CONFIDENT AND SAY 
TO PEOPLE SEND YOUR CHILDREN TODAY 
CARE LET THEM EAT DIRT LET THEM 
HAVE LOTS OF EARLY INFECTIONS IT'S 
GOOD FOR THEM AND IT'S NICE TO BE 
ABLE TO SAY THOSE THINGS WITH A 
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE 
A FEW 
WEEKS AND SEVERAL INFECTIONS LATER 
IT WAS TIME TO PREPARE 
TRANSPLANT TRANSPLANT GOING TO NURSERY DID NOT HELP LUISA 
DOCHERTY WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH 
LEUKAEMIA WHEN SHE WAS TWELVE AND HAD 
YEARS OF CHEMOTHERAPY AND A BONE 
MARROW TRANSPLANT NOW AT EIGHTEEN SHE 
IS MUCH BETTER AND ENJOYING BEING 
A TEENAGER 
I WENT TO NURSERY WHEN I WAS 
YOUNGER AND I STILL GOT LEUKAEMIA 
THERE IS PROBABLY MORE THAN ONE 
CAUSE OF IT ALTHOUGH IF THIS 
MIGHT HELP FIND OUT WHY I GOT 
LEUKAEMIA IT MIGHT HELP SOMEBODY 
ELSE 
CHILDHOOD LEUKAEMIA IS A ELSE COMPLEX CONDITION AND THERE IS NO 
SUGGESTION INFECTION IS THE ONLY 
CAUSE BUT MAKING SURE CHILDREN GET 
EXPOSED TO LOTS OF COUGHS AND 
SNUFFLES MAY JUST BE WARM WAY TO 
HELP PREVENT IT 
ONE WAY AS CAMBODIA STRUGGLES TO 
BUILD ITS FUTURE MANY SEE 
EDUCATION AS THE KEY TO BRINGING 
PROSPERITY BUT THE COUNTRY'S 
SCHOOLS SYSTEM IS TROUBLED 
TEACHERS ARE THREATENING TO GO ON 
STRIKE THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT BEING 
PAID ENOUGH AND SCHOOL CHILDREN 
ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE THE TEACHERS 
HAVE BEEN ASKING THEM TO TOP UP 
THEIR EARNINGS AND PAY THEM 
INFORMAL FEES AS OUR REPORTER 
SAYS IT HAS FORCED MANY CHILDREN 
TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL 
PICH LY SHOULD BE JOINING THE OTHER 
CHILDREN GOING TO SCHOOL BUT SHE 
CAN ONLY LOOK ON AS THEY HAD TO 
SCHOOL EDUCATION FOR PICH LY ENDED 
MORE THAN A YEAR AGO WHEN SHE WAS 
THIRTEEN BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT AFFORD TO 
PAY HER TEACHER INSTEAD SHE 
SPENDS HER DAYS COLLECTING SCRAP 
IT COULD BE WORSE OTHER YOUNG 
DROP OUTS END UP ON THE STREETS 
WHERE IT IS ALL TOO EASY TO FALL 
INTO SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SEX WORK 
THE LITTLE THAT PICH LY OWNS KEEPS 
HER YOUNGER SISTERS IN SCHOOL 
OFFICIALLY EDUCATION IS FREE BUT 
THEIR MOTHER MAKES SURE THE GIRLS 
HAVE MONEY FOR THEIR TEACHERS IF 
THEY DON'T PAY THEY COULD GET BAD 
GRADES BE SENT FROM CLASS OR JUST 
IGNORED PICH LY'S FAMILY OFTEN 
EARN LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR PER DAY LIKE THE 
MAJORITY OF CAMBODIANS THERE ARE 
HARD CHOICES TO BE MADE BETWEEN 
SENDING CHILDREN TO SCHOOL OR 
PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE THE 
EQUATION DID NOT ADD UP FOR PICH LY 
WHEN I HAD MONEY I 
WENT TO SCHOOL WHEN I DIDN'T I 
COULDN'T THEN THE SITUATION OF MY 
FAMILY GOT WORSE AND THE TEACHERS 
SAID IF YOU CANNOT COME AND PAY 
DON'T COME AT ALL INFORMAL 
COMMUNITY CLASSES LIKE THESE ARE 
THE BEST THAT MANY POOR CHILDREN 
CAN HOPE FOR 
EDUCATION MIGHT HELP THE YOUNGER 
GENERATION ESCAPE THE POVERTY TRAP 
BUT THE COST OF BRIBES IS SHUTTING 
THEM OUT WITHOUT AN EDUCATION THE 
FUTURE LOOKS BLEAK FOR CHILDREN 
LIKE THESE SCRAP COLLECTING IS 
PERHAPS ONE OF THE BETTER OPTIONS 
FOR THEM THEY ARE EXTREMELY 
VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION BUT 
CAMBODIA'S TEACHERS WOULD TELL YOU 
THAT THEY HAVE GOT PROBLEMS AS WELL 
THIS TEACHER IS TYPICAL OF 
CAMBODIAN EDUCATORS WHEN HE IS NOT 
IN HIS CLASSROOM AT A STATE SCHOOL 
HE IS EARNING A LITTLE BIT EXTRA AS 
A PRIVATE TUTOR EVEN A CHILD CAN 
DO THE MATHS WITH TEACHERS' 
SALARIES ARE AS LOW AS THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH 
INFORMAL FEES ARE ORAM MATTER OF 
SURVIVAL SURVIVAL WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT 
TO INCREASE OUR SUMMARY SO THAT WE 
HAVE A LIVING WAGE THEN TEACHERS 
WOULD BE VERY HAPPY AND THE 
QUALITY OF SCHOOL TEACHING WOULD 
IMPROVE BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T NEED 
EXTRA INCOME FROM PRIVATE LESSONS 
CAMBODIAN EDUCATION HAS MADE GREAT 
STRIDES SINCE THE RETURN OF PEACE A 
DECADE AGO NOW ALMOST ALL 
CHILDREN START PRIMARY SCHOOL BUT 
MORE THAN HALF OF FEMALE STUDENTS 
DROP OUT BEFORE THEIR TEENS 
INFORMAL FEES ARE A MAJOR REASON 
FOR GIRLS LIKE PICH LY SIFTING 
GARBAGE WHEN THEY SHOULD BE 
LEARNING UNTIL TEACHERS ARE PAID A 
LIVING WAGE IT SEEMS THE NUMBER OF 
CHILDREN LOCKED OUT OF SCHOOL WILL 
CONTINUE TO RELEASE 
TO RISE 
LET'S REMIND YOU NOW OF OUR TOP 
STORY THERE IS A NEW EFFORT FROM 
THE UNITED NATIONS TO COUNTER THE 
RISING PRICE OF FOOD STAPLES AROUND 
THE WORLD A SPECIAL TASK FORCE IS 
BEING SET UP THEIR FIRST JOB WILL 
BE TO FEED THE HUNGRY ESTIMATED BY 
THE UN TO NUMBER ONE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE 
THIS IS WORLD NEWS TODAY AND THAT 
IS ALL FROM THE PROGRAMME NEXT ON 
B. B. C. FOUR IT IS THE WEATHER BUT 
FOR NOW FROM ME AND FROM THE REST 
OF THE TEAM GOODBYE 
THE HELLO RAIN DOMINATES OUR 
FORECAST ONCE AGAIN THE MET OFFICE 
HAS GOT A SEVERE WEATHER WARNING 
OUT FOR THIS EVENING FOR PARTS OF 
SOUTH WALES THE WEST COUNTRY AND 
THE WEST MIDLANDS IT IS ALL 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE IT TO BE WORKING FURTHER 
NORTH OVERNIGHT TONIGHT IT'LL BE 
TWO SEPARATE BANDS OF RAIN BOTH 
LOOKING UP INTO THE ONE SYSTEM IF 
YOU LIKE HOOKING UP BY THE 
AFTERNOON THIS IS THE WAY THINGS 
WILL BE BREAKING DOWN FOR NORTHERN 
AND WESTERN AREAS OF SCOTLAND SOME 
HEAVY AND PERSISTENT RAIN SOUTH OF 
THAT PERHAPS A LITTLE BRIGHTER 
HOPEFULLY TOWARDS THE SOUTH COAST 
THERE WILL BE SOME INCREASINGLY 
SHOWERY WEATHER 
THERE COULD BE SOME SHARP SHOWERS 
FOLLOWING ON IN THE AFTERNOON IT 
LOOKS LIKE NORTHERN IRELAND MAY GET 
AWAY LARGELY UNSCATHED WITH JUST A 
LITTLE BIT OF RAIN THERE THAT 
SYSTEM STAYS CLOSE BY TO THE U. K. FOR 
SUNDAY FOR THURSDAY 
GENERALLY THURSDAY A QUIETER DAY 
FEWER SHOWERS FINALLY THINGS 
GETTING A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER AND 
WARMER
