THE WESTERN CALENDAR TRADITIONALLY DATES FROM THE BIRTH OF CHRIST 
TWO THOUSAND YEARS LATER WE MIGHT BE FORGIVEN 
FOR THINKING IT DATES FROM THE BIRTH OF DAN BROWN'S THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
THAT'S B. C. BEFORE THE CODE AND AD AFTER DAN 
IT'S A MEASURE OF HOW THIS INNOCENT LOOKING THRILLER HAS SHAKEN THE ESTABLISHMENT 
MORE PEOPLE ARE READING THE D. A. VINCI CODE THAN THE SCRIPTURES AND THE GOSPELS 
MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING INTRODUCED TO THE CHURCH 
AND TO CHRISTIANITY THROUGH THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
AND THE WORD ACCORDING TO DAN BROWN IS THAT CHRIST WAS NOT ONLY 
A MERE MORTAL BUT HUSBAND TO MARY MAGDALENE AND A FATHER 
IT IS SIMPLY MORE PLAUSIBLE THAT A MAN SHOULD LAY CLAIM TO THE THRONE 
BE MARRIED AND HAVE CHILDREN 
THAN THAT HE SHOULD BE BORN OF THE VIRGIN 
WALK ON WATER AND RISE FROM THE DEAD 
ALTHOUGH MARKETED AS A NOVEL THE D. A. VINCI CODE'S CAREFULLY CREATED 
AIR OF AUTHENTICITY HAS MADE US QUESTION 
WHY WE TAKE THE AUTHORISED VERSION OF HISTORY ON TRUST 
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD ON THE WHOLE BY CHRISTIANS AND SO ON 
AND CHURCH PEOPLE AND OTHERS IS TRUE 
IS ACTUALLY VERY DUBIOUSLY SOURCED 
AND WITH FORTY THREE MILLION SALES WORLDWIDE DAN BROWN'S SECULAR JESUS AND MARY 
SEEM TO HAVE ATTRACTED A DEVOTED FOLLOWING 
THINGS LIKE THE THE D. A. VINCI CODE WILL NOT JUST ATTRACT READERS 
THAT'S O. K. WHAT IS RATHER DISCONCERTING 
IS ATTRACTING BELIEVERS BUT ARE WE JUST BEING CYNICALLY MANIPULATED 
IT IS NOT AS IF THIS IS THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVING ON THE WATERS THIS IS CAPITALISM 
OR HAS DAN BROWN CRACKED THE MOST DIFFICULT CODE OF ALL 
HOW TO FIND MEANING IN THE MATERIALISTIC TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO BELIEVE AGAIN 
EVEN IF IT IS ONLY TO BELIEVE IN CONSPIRACY 
IN CASE YOU'VE BEEN CLOISTERED IN A MONASTERY SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE 
THE D. A. VINCI CODE IS THE FOURTH 
AND MOST SUCCESSFUL NOVEL BY AMERICAN AUTHOR DAN BROWN 
IT IS OFFICIALLY THE WORLD'S FASTEST SELLING BOOK 
ITS STORY IS THAT FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
THE CHURCH HAS FED US A MYTH ABOUT JESUS' DEATH AND RESURRECTION 
WHILE SUPPRESSING THE TRUTH THAT HE FOUNDED A BLOODLINE THAT EXISTS TO THIS DAY 
THE SECRET IS BEING KEPT ALIVE 
BY A SHADOWY ORGANISATION CALLED THE PRIORY OF SION 
THE LIFE OF THE BOOK HAS BEEN EVERY BIT AS EXTRAORDINARY AS ITS CONTENT 
IT'S BEEN MADE INTO A HOLLYWOOD FILM 
HAVE YOU ENJOYED LONDON LOVELY TOWN 
NICE PEOPLE 
IT'S PROVOKED PROTEST '. ABOUT THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
SISTER MARY MICHAEL IS HOLDING A PROTEST AGAINST THE FILM WHICH SHE CONSIDERS TO BE A HERESY 
AND FIERCE DEBATE 
THE CROWDS HAVE COME ALONG FOR A LECTURE SERIES ON THE D. A. VINCI CODE AND ITS CLAIMS' 
THE INTEREST IS ENORMOUS AND THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT HISTORY AND RELIGION 
IT'S BEEN DISSECTED IN COURT FOLLOWING CLAIMS OF PLAGIARISM 
THE HISTORIANS WHO WROTE THE HOLY BLOOD AND THE HOLY GRAIL 
SAY THE WHOLE ARCHITECTURE OF THEIR BOOK HAS BEEN STOLEN BY DAN BROWN 
RANDOM HOUSE WILL ARGUE THAT IDEAS HAVE BEEN RECYCLED FOR CENTURIES' 
AND IT'S LEADING BRITAIN'S TOURIST RECOVERY FOLLOWING THE LONDON BOMBINGS 
O. K. THIS IS TEMPLE CHURCH 
WE ARE RATHER TUCKED AWAY OFF FLEET STREET AND SO A GREAT MANY PEOPLE NEVER EVEN KNEW WE EXISTED 
UNTIL THE D. A. VINCI CODE CAME OUT 
SOME OF THE LIFE OF THE D. A. VINCI CODE WHICH I THINK WE HAVEN'T TAKEN ENOUGH INTO ACCOUNT 
IS LESS THE ACTUAL READING OF THE BOOK 
AND MORE THE AFTER LIFE IT HAS ON 
WELL WHAT IF WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE IDEA 
HAVEN'T YOU WONDERED ABOUT 
HE'S GOT SOME PRETTY PLAUSIBLE THEORIES ON MARY MAGDALENE AND THAT STUFF 
BUT I WOULD HAVE TO DO RESEARCH BEFORE I WOULD HAVE FIGURED IT OUT 
I THINK IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO RE EXAMINE PERHAPS THINGS 
WE HAVE TAKEN FOR GRANTED YES SO IT IS BENEFICIAL 
READING IT NOW I THINK IS THIS REALLY TRUE 
IS IT JUST A GOOD STORY A GOOD YARN 
WHICH I THINK IT IS 
READERS ARE INTRIGUED EVEN SYMPATHETIC TO THE PLOT 
BECAUSE IT BUILDS ON IDEAS SUCH AS THE HOLY GRAIL 
WHICH HOVER IN THE POPULAR IMAGINATION BETWEEN LEGEND AND HISTORY 
MANY OF THE IDEAS ADVANCED IN IT 
HAD BEEN TALKED ABOUT BEFORE FOR MANY CENTURIES 
LONG BEFORE BROWN WROTE HIS BOOK THE B. B. C. HAD EXPLORED SIMILAR 
TERRITORY IN A DOCUMENTARY SERIES CALLED CHRONICLE MADE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
THE PROGRAMMES INVESTIGATED THE SUDDEN SECRET WEALTH OF A FRENCH PRIEST 
IN THE TOWN OF RENNES LE CHATEAU AND HIS CONNECTIONS TO THE PRIORY OF SION 
THE PRIEST WHO BEGAN IN POVERTY AND YET SPENT MILLIONS 
WHO MADE A DISCOVERY IN HIS CHURCH OF THE PARCHMENTS WHICH HID SECRET MESSAGES 
ONE SPEAKING OF A TREASURE BELONGING TO DAGOBERT AND TO SION 
THE THING ABOUT THE CHRONICLE SERIES WAS THAT 
THEY WEREN'T SOME KIND OF NEW AGE HIPPY DIPPY DOCUMENTARY 
THEY WERE A PROPER SOURCED HISTORICAL DOCUMENTARY SERIES 
THE IMPACT ON THE VIEWING PUBLIC WAS ENORMOUS 
THEY WERE AT THE TIME REGARDED AS 
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DOCUMENTARIES THE B. B. C. HAD EVER DONE 
THE PRESENTER AND PROGRAMME CONSULTANT WAS HENRY LINCOLN 
HE LOOKED VERY CREDIBLE AS A PRESENTER 
HE HAS A RATHER MAGISTERIAL WAY OF PRESENTING HIMSELF 
TELLING YOU THESE AMAZING THINGS THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED 
THESE INCREDIBLE DOCUMENTS 
AMONG THE INFORMATION IT CONTAINS IS A LIST OF THE NAMES OF THE PRIORY OF SION'S GRAND MASTERS 
AFTER THEIR SEPARATION FROM THE TEMPLARS AND UP TO THE PRESENT DAY 
VICTOR HUGO JEAN COCTEAU 
LEONARDO D. A. VINCI ISAAC NEWTON 
SOME OF THESE NAMES ARE SO ILLUSTRIOUS THAT THE LIST SEEMS JUST THE SORT OF GRANDIOSE PEDIGREE 
THAT WOULD BE CREATED FOR ITSELF BY A LUNATIC FRINGE BODY OF ECCENTRICS PLAYING AT SECRET SOCIETIES 
YOU WERE INCLINED TO SAY THIS HAS GOT THE B. B. C.'S IMPRIMATUR UPON IT 
IT THEREFORE MUST BE TRUE 
HOWEVER HENRY LINCOLN WAS MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE WORLD OF FICTION THAN FACT 
HE WASN'T A QUALIFIED HISTORIAN HE HADN'T TAUGHT 
HE HADN'T DONE ANY MAJOR HISTORICAL WORKS 
HE WAS PROBABLY AT THAT STAGE BEST KNOWN AS A SCRIPT WRITER FOR DOCTOR WHO 
AND THE STORY OF THE PRIORY OF SION READ RATHER LIKE A SCRIPT 
THE PRIORY OF SION 
DOES IT STILL EXIST 
IS IT REALLY STILL ALIVE 
STILL A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH 
NOVELIST RICHARD LEIGH 
COLLABORATED WITH LINCOLN ON THE THIRD CHRONICLE PROGRAMME 
HENRY WAS SWAMPED WITH THE RECORD QUANTITY OF FAN MAIL 
THE NUMBER OF LETTERS RECEIVED DWARFED ANYTHING THE BEEB HAD DONE PREVIOUSLY 
REQUESTS FOR MORE INFORMATION REQUESTS FOR FILMS REQUESTS FOR A BOOK 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO LINCOLN LEIGH AND A COLLEAGUE MICHAEL BAIGENT 
EXPANDED THEIR RESEARCH IN THE HOLY BLOOD AND THE HOLY GRAIL 
WHEN THE BOOK APPEARED IT WITHIN A DAY SHOT TO THE TOP OF THE BEST SELLER LIST 
FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS IT SOLD ON A SCALE COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
IN THE BOOK THEY SPECULATED THAT THE PRIORY OF SION 
WAS FORMED TO PROTECT THE HOLY GRAIL AND ITS SECRET 
THAT CHRIST'S BLOODLINE DESCENDED THROUGH THE MEROVINGIAN KINGS OF FRANCE 
THE THEOLOGIANS NATURALLY WERE UP IN ARMS 
YOU CAN TAKE THE MESSAGE AND TURN NOW TO THE BISHOP 
WHAT DOES THE MESSAGE WHAT IS THAT GOING TO MEAN TO CHRISTIANITY 
IF ACCEPTED AS TRUE WOULD THERE BE ANY POINT IN CONTINUING WITH CHRISTIANITY 
THEY'LL NOT ACCEPT IT AS TRUE AND THAT IS A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION WHICH IS USELESS 
LET'S CONSIDER WHETHER IT IS TRUE BECAUSE NO ONE IS GOING TO ACCEPT A THESIS 
WHICH IS SO ACADEMICALLY ABSURD 
AND THE PROFESSIONAL HISTORIANS WERE UP IN ARMS BECAUSE WE HAD TRESPASSED ON THEIR TERRITORY 
AND WE HAD COMMITTED THE CARDINAL SIN OF MAKING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN DIVERSE SPHERES 
REGULAR TRIANGLES 
WHAT POSSIBLE CONNECTION COULD THERE BE BETWEEN GEOMETRY 
AND THE PRIEST WHO FOUND TREASURE IN A SLEEPY PYRENEAN VILLAGE 
WHAT HOLY BLOOD HOLY GRAIL DID 
WAS TO DISMISS REPUTABLE EVIDENCE 
WHICH DIDN'T GO WITH ITS THEORIES 
ACCEPT DISREPUTABLE EVIDENCE AND FILL IN THE GAPS WHERE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE AT ALL 
THEN I REMEMBERED THAT RENNES LE CHATEAU IS ONLY ONE 
OF THREE CASTLES VITAL TO THIS STORY 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE AUTHORS OF THE HOLY BLOOD AND THE HOLY GRAIL CLAIMED 
WAS THAT THERE WAS AN OLD DRY AND INADEQUATE SCHOLARLY WAY OF DOING HISTORY 
WHICH WAS ESSENTIALLY ANALYTICAL THIS WOULDN'T SUIT THEIR PURPOSES 
THERE IS A PASSAGE WHERE THEY SAY THIS 
WHAT THEY HAD TO COME UP WITH WAS A NEW ESSENTIALLY SYNTHETIC WAY 
OF LOOKING AT HISTORY WHICH EFFECTIVELY MEANT IT ALLOWED THEM 
TO JOIN UP ANY TWO UTTERLY DISPARATE POINTS 
IF THEY COULD FIND ANY POINT OF CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM AT ALL 
AND IF THEY COULD FIND ANY POINT OF CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM AT ALL TO SAY THAT THEY WERE CONNECTED 
COINCIDENCE 
THE ACCURACY IS ASTONISHING 
ONE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT IN CERTAIN AREAS 
ANY RESEARCH INEVITABLY IS GOING TO BE HISTORICAL CONJECTURE 
MOST BIBLICAL SCHOLARSHIP INVOLVES CONJECTURE 
IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE B. B. C. MADE ANOTHER INVESTIGATION 
INTO THE PRIORY OF SION IN A TIMEWATCH DOCUMENTARY 
THIS TIME IT CONCLUDED IT WAS A MODERN HOAX BY A FRENCHMAN 
PIERRE PLANTARD WHO WAS CLAIMING DESCENT FROM THE MEROVINGIAN KINGS 
UNDER FRENCH LAW EVERY NEW CLUB OR ASSOCIATION MUST REGISTER ITSELF WITH THE AUTHORITIES 
AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS A DOSSIER HERE SHOWING THAT A PRIORY OF SION FILED THE PROPER FORMS IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX 
I AM OLDER THAN THE PRIORY OF SION 
ACCORDING TO A FOUNDING MEMBER THIS ECCENTRIC ASSOCIATION TOOK 
ITS NAME NOT FROM JERUSALEM BUT FROM A NEARBY MOUNTAIN 
THE DOSSIER ALSO NOTES THAT THE PRIORY'S SELF STYLED GRAND MASTER 
PIERRE PLANTARD WHO IS CENTRAL TO THIS STORY HAS DONE TIME IN JAIL 
ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK IS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS 
IS THE WAY IN WHICH THE AUTHORS OF THE HOLY BLOOD AND THE HOLY GRAIL 
HAVE NEVER AS FAR AS I KNOW TURNED ROUND 
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD AND SAID IT WAS A LOAD OF RUBBISH 
TERRIBLY SORRY AND ALL THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE THE MONEY BACK COS WE'VE SPEND IT ALL 
AND WE DID DO QUITE A LOT OF WORK AND WE WERE HOAXED TOO 
BUT ACTUALLY IT'S ALL COMPLETE AND UTTER TOSH 
THE AUTHORS HOWEVER STILL MAINTAIN 
THERE WAS A PRIORY OF SION IN MEDIEVAL TIMES 
WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE 
NINETEEN FIFTY SIX PRIEURE WAS A LATTER DAY CONCOCTION 
WHETHER IT WAS A CONTINUATION OF THE MEDIEVAL PRIEURE 
WHETHER PLANTARD AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX ORDER 
SIMPLY HIJACKED THE NAME OF THE MEDIEVAL ORGANISATION 
AND APPENDED THEIR OWN OPERATION TO IT 
BUT THEY NEVER CLAIMED THE BOOK WAS PURE HISTORY 
WE NEVER SAID THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE 
WE NEVER SAID THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED 
WE DIDN'T EVEN SAY THIS IS PROBABLY WHAT HAPPENED 
ALL WE ATTEMPTED TO DO WAS ASK 
ARE THE VARIOUS POINTS OF THIS HYPOTHESIS PLAUSIBLE 
IS IT PLAUSIBLE THAT JESUS MIGHT HAVE HAD A CLAIM TO THE THRONE 
IS IT PLAUSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MARRIED HAVE CHILDREN 
THAT THOSE CHILDREN EVENTUALLY MIGHT HAVE INTER MARRIED TO PRODUCE THE MEROVINGIAN BLOOD LINE 
AND WE CONCLUDED YES IT WAS PLAUSIBLE 
AND THAT WAS ALL WE CONCLUDED 
SO THE IRONY OF THE RECENT PLAGIARISM COURT CASE 
IS THAT THERE'S LITTLE HISTORICAL BASIS FOR EITHER BOOK 
I THINK IT IS BIZARRE THIS COURT CASE OF BAIGENT AND LEIGH 
VERSUS DAN BROWN BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT THE WHOLE THING IS MADE UP 
THAT THE ONE SIDE SAYS NO WE MADE IT UP AND THE OTHER SIDE SAYS NO I MADE IT UP 
SO IF ANYBODY WAS IN ANY DOUBT THAT THIS WAS COMPLETE FICTION 
THEY JUST NEED TO LOOK AT THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE COURT CASE 
LEIGH AND BAIGENT SAY ALL THEY WANTED WAS A FULLER 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THEIR WORK NOT JUST THE PASSING REFERENCE THE D. A. VINCI CODE GIVES THEM 
HERE IS PERHAPS THE BEST KNOWN TOME 
TEABING SAID PULLING A TATTERED HARD COVER FROM THE STACK AND HANDING IT TO HER 
THE COVER READ HOLY BLOOD HOLY GRAIL THE ACCLAIMED INTERNATIONAL BEST SELLER 
SOPHIE GLANCED UP 
AN INTERNATIONAL BEST SELLER I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT 
AND THE REFERENCE TO THE HOLY BLOOD AND THE HOLY GRAIL 
IS ONE THAT DAMNS US WITH FAINT PRAISE 
NOR DOES IT EVEN MENTION THE AUTHORS 
FOR ALL THE UNINITIATED READER KNOWS 
THE BOOK COULD BE FICTITIOUS 
HOWEVER DAN BROWN DOES HINT AT THE AUTHORS' EXISTENCE 
THROUGH HIS MISCHIEVOUSLY NAMED CHARACTER LEIGH TEABING 
LEIGH TEABING IT'S THE NAME OF A CHARACTER FROM THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
AND LOOK TEABING IS AN ANAGRAM OF BAIGENT 
AND LOOK WHAT DAN BROWN HAS DONE HERE 
HE HAS TAKEN ALL THE LETTERS FROM RICHARD LEIGH'S SURNAME 
AND REPLACED THEM WITH IDENTICAL REPLICAS 
AND WHAT SORT OF CHARACTER IS LEIGH TEABING 
WELL HE IS AN ENGLISH EXPERT ON BOOKS ABOUT THE HOLY GRAIL 
I DON'T THINK 
THE PATRONISING 
SLIGHTLY COMIC SLIGHTLY SINISTER FIGURE OF LEIGH TEABING 
CONSTITUTES AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
DESPITE BEING ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FICTIONAL DEVICES 
BROWN'S BOOK OFFERS ITSELF AS FACTUALLY BASED 
WHEN YOU READ THE HOLY BLOOD AND THE HOLY GRAIL 
WHICH PURPORTS TO BE A WORK OF FACT 
IT FEELS AS THOUGH YOU ARE READING A WORK OF FICTION 
IT SEEMS TO BE FULL OF WILD AND FANTASTIC LEAPS OF THE IMAGINATION FROM ONE FACT TO ANOTHER 
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE D. A. VINCI CODE WHICH PURPORTS TO BE FICTION 
BUT WHEN YOU READ IT IT FEELS AS THOUGH YOU'RE READING A BOOK 
A NOVEL FULL OF FACTUAL ACCURACIES IT EVEN STARTS WITH THE WORD FACT 
THE FASCINATING WAY THE BOOK ITSELF SEEMS TO BE CONSTRUCTED IS THAT 
THE BEGINNING OF IT TELLS YOU THESE ARE THE FACTS 
THAT IS THE FIRST STEP INTO THE FICTION OF THE BOOK 
IT IS QUITE A CLEVER ENGAGING DEVICE 
SO FOR ANY NOVELIST TO STATE THAT CATEGORICALLY THIS IS FACT 
MEANS HE EXPECTS THE READER TO ACCEPT IT AS SUCH AND MOST READERS WILL 
DAN BROWN HAS COME SO CLOSE TO SOMETHING 
THAT IS DEEP AND IMPORTANT AND TRUE AND AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT HE 
SHOOTS OFF INTO ORBIT AND INTO FANTASY 
I BELIEVED A LOT MORE THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE ABOUT IT AND THOUGHT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF FACT IN IT 
IT MADE ME PRETTY AMAZED ABOUT IT ALL BECAUSE I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT REALLY EXISTED 
IT IS PRETTY AMAZING THAT IT IS ALL REAL I GUESS 
IN THE CASE OF THE D. A. VINCI CODE ACTUALLY THE ASSERTION IN THE FRONT 
IS QUITE CLEVERLY WRITTEN BECAUSE HE DOES NOT ASSERT THAT THE BOOK IS FACTUALLY TRUE 
HE ASSERTS THAT 
OPUS DEI EXISTS THAT IT IS CONTROVERSIAL THAT THE PRIORY OF SION EXISTS 
WHAT HE DOESN'T SAY IS IT'S A COMPLETELY NEW INVENTION AND IS ABSOLUTE NONSENSE 
AND HE ASSERTS THAT HIS DESCRIPTION OF PLACES ARE CORRECT 
THOUGH HOW HE CAME TO PUT VERSAILLES NORTH OF PARIS I SHALL NEVER KNOW 
BUT WHAT HE NEVER EVER SAID ACTUALLY WAS THAT THE WAS FACTUALLY CORRECT 
BUT PEOPLE SORT OF READ THAT PREFACE QUICKLY 
AND THEN ASSUMED THAT WAS WHAT HE HAD SAID 
COMMENTATORS ARE DIVIDED OVER WHETHER IT MATTERS THAT READERS ARE TAKEN IN 
THE D. A. VINCI CODE IS A STRANGE HYBRID ANIMAL 
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT IS PARTLY ABOUT HISTORY IT IS SET IN THE PRESENT 
SO SOME OF THE RULES YOU APPLY TO HISTORICAL FICTION 
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO IMMEDIATELY APPLY TO IT 
I SUPPOSE THE ONLY ARGUMENT ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THE D. A. VINCI CODE IS 
HOW THEREFORE HONEST YOU ARE ABOUT ALL OF THE SOURCE MATERIAL THAT YOU BASED IT ON 
SO PEOPLE CAN ALWAYS SAY LOOK IT WAS HERE I DREW ON IT 
BUT I MADE MORE OF IT THAN IT IS BECAUSE THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION 
AND THOSE WERE WORKS OF PSEUDO FACT OR THEORY 
IF DAN BROWN PUTS THAT PREFACE AT THE FRONT OF HIS BOOK 
HE IS FOLLOWING IN A LONG AND FRANKLY NOBLE LITERARY TRADITION 
DANIEL DEFOE IN ROBINSON CRUSOE SUPPOSEDLY THE FIRST ENGLISH NOVEL 
HAD A PREFACE THAT SAID EVERYTHING IN THIS BOOK IS TRUE 
IT WAS A DEVICE TO MAKE HIS READERS INTERESTED 
IN FACT DEFOE DID BASE IT ON A TRUE STORY BUT HE MADE MUCH MORE OF ROBINSON CRUSOE UP 
MUCH THE SAME AS DAN BROWN 
IF YOU BELIEVED IT IF YOU TOOK ANY ACTION BASED ON THE NOTION THAT YOU BELIEVED IT 
IF IT AFFECTED ANY OF YOUR OTHER KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS TO THE TRUTH 
THEN YOU HAVE BEEN SOLD A PUP 
SO WHY DID DAN BROWN WRITE THAT PREFACE 
IF DAN BROWN HADN'T PUT THAT PREFACE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE SUCCESS IT WAS 
BUT OF COURSE BROWN IS ALSO AN ACCOMPLISHED HANDLER OF THE THRILLER FORMAT 
ARGH 
IT WAS A GOOD READ 
IT KEPT ME GRIPPED I FOUND IT QUITE DIFFICULT TO PUT DOWN 
I'M GETTING TO A POINT WHERE THEY'VE BASHED ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT PEOPLE OVER THE HEAD 
AND I WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT 
I HAD A LOT OF ADMIRATION FOR THE SKILL IN HOLDING AN AUDIENCE 
I HAD A LOT OF ADMIRATION FOR THE FACT THAT AT THE END OF EACH CHAPTER 
YOU HAVE TO READ ON TO THE NEXT PAGE 
IT'S KIND OF CLUNKY THE WAY IT'S PUT TOGETHER 
YOU CAN ALMOST SEE THE MECHANISM 
YOU CAN SEE THAT HE ENDS EVERY CHAPTER WITH A QUESTION THAT HAS TO BE RESOLVED IN THE NEXT 
AS A THRILLER WRITER I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER IN THAT 
IF YOU HUH DO IT ONE TOO MANY TIMES PEOPLE START TO GET BORED 
THEY START TO SEE THAT IT IS A DEVICE 
BUT THE CLEVER THING ABOUT THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
IS THAT EXACTLY WHEN YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE THE DEVICE 
YOU ARE HAVING FED INTO YOU QUITE INTERESTING BITS OF SECRET PSEUDO HISTORY 
SO YOU ARE SLIGHTLY MORE INTELLECTUALLY INTERESTED AS WELL AS BEING MANIPULATED 
AND BROWN'S NARRATIVE DRAWS ON MANY SOURCES 
IT IS A PLOT TRAWLING OF EVERY ESOTERIC POTBOILER FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS 
IT HAS GOT INGREDIENTS COMPONENTS 
THAT WILL APPEAL TO MOST PEOPLE 
ON A SUBLIMINAL SEMI CONSCIOUS OR SUBCONSCIOUS LEVEL 
LOST KINGS BURIED TREASURE SECRET SOCIETIES CONSPIRACIES 
ALL OF THIS IS POTENT HEADY STUFF 
YOU PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER FOUR OR FIVE OF THE MOST POTENT MYTHS IN EUROPEAN HISTORY 
INTO ONE INTERWOVEN SAGA AND YOU'VE GOT A WINNER ON YOUR HANDS 
IT'S A VERY CLEVER BUT ACTUALLY RATHER OLD FASHIONED THRILLER 
HITCHCOCK USED TO DEFINE THE THRILLER AS BEING SOMETHING THAT NEEDED A MCGUFFIN 
IT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT IT WAS BUT THERE WAS A REASON FOR THE PLOT 
TO START ROLLING WHICH THEN THREW CONFLICT AND OBSTACLES IN THE WAY 
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THE SEARCH FOR THE HOLY GRAIL IS ABOUT 
THE BIGGEST MCGUFFIN YOU COULD HAVE IF WRITING A THRILLER 
THE LEGEND OF THE HOLY GRAIL WAS ITSELF A LITERARY INVENTION 
IT WAS INVENTED IN THE LATE TWELFTH CENTURY BY CHRETIEN DE TROYES 
ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T AT ALL CLEAR WHAT IT WAS 
BUT IT VERY SOON CAME TO BE ASSOCIATED EITHER WITH THE CUP CHRIST HAD USED AT THE LAST SUPPER 
OR THE DISH IN WHICH THERE HAD BEEN THE MEAT AT THE LAST SUPPER 
AND FURTHER THAT JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA HAD USED THIS VESSEL 
TO COLLECT CHRIST'S BLOOD FROM THE TIME OF THE CRUCIFIXION 
THAT VERY VERY QUICKLY CAME TO BE BELIEVED 
AND ALL SORTS LIKE NOW OF BODIES STARTED EXPLOITING THIS 
THE MOST FAMOUS FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW IS THE ABBEY AT GLASTONBURY 
WHICH WAS BUSY BUILDING ITS REPUTATION ON THE ARTHURIAN MYTH 
GLASTONBURY ABBEY FIXED THE GRAIL IN THE PUBLIC IMAGINATION 
WHAT IT WAS FIXED AT WAS 
SOMETHING WHICH WAS OUT THERE 
TO BE SEARCHED FOR 
IT COULD BE FOUND IF ONLY YOU WERE HEROIC AND PURE ENOUGH 
BUT WAS UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT TO FIND 
THE GRAIL MYTH THEN WENT UNDERGROUND UNTIL THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
AND THE MAN WHO ABOVE ALL RESTORED IT IT WAS WAGNER 
IN LOHENGRIN AND PARSIFAL 
IN MODERN TIMES THE GRAIL HAS BECOME SOMETHING LESS TANGIBLE AS DAN BROWN RECOGNISES 
THEN FOR MOST I SUSPECT THE HOLY GRAIL IS SIMPLY A GRAND IDEA 
THE GLORIOUS UNATTAINABLE TREASURE 
THAT SOMEHOW EVEN IN TODAY'S WORLD OF CHAOS INSPIRES US 
THE BOOK'S MAIN CHARACTERS HUNT THE GRAIL 
BUT THEY ARE ALSO SEEKING PERSONAL ANSWERS 
IN NEW AGEISM IT IS VERY OFTEN THAT THE GRAIL CEASES TO BE ACTUALLY A PHYSICAL CUP 
AND BECOMES SOMETHING ELSE 
AND THIS IS WHERE THIS SPILLS OVER INTO DAN BROWN 
ONE'S SEARCH FOR THE HOLY GRAIL IS A SEARCH FOR SELF REALISATION SELF UNDERSTANDING 
IN THE D. A. VINCI CODE THE SECRET OF THE GRAIL IS PRESERVED IN CRYPTIC FORM 
IN SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS OLD MASTER PAINTINGS 
PICTURES WERE A GREAT CHOICE BECAUSE WITHOUT LABELS 
WITHOUT CLEAR LABELS YOU CAN MAKE ANYTHING OF THEM 
YOU CAN BRING ANY POTENTIAL INTERPRETATION AND ENCOURAGE 
YOUR VIEWERS TO SEE THEM IN A WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENT WAYS 
THE IDEA OF GREAT SECRETS HIDDEN IN PAINTINGS 
HAD BEEN CHAMPIONED BY HENRY LINCOLN IN THE CHRONICLE SERIES 
HE SAW POSSIBLE CLUES IN A PAINTING BY NICOLAS POUSSIN 
WHICH FEATURED A GRAVE CLOSE TO RENNES LE CHATEAU 
LINCOLN WONDERED IF POUSSIN WAS THE ARTIST AND IF THE SHEPHERDESS WAS 
AN ALLUSION TO POUSSIN'S BEST KNOWN PAINTING THE SHEPHERDS OF ARCADIA 
THE OBVIOUS RELEVANCE OF THE PAINTING LED ME TO UNDERTAKE A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF IT 
I FOUND WHAT SEEMED TO ME TO BE A CURIOUS AND RIGID GEOMETRY 
I SOUGHT THE GUIDANCE OF PROFESSOR CORNFORD OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF ART 
WHO HAS MADE A STUDY OF THE GEOMETRY OF PAINTINGS 
AS I WORKED ON THE PAINTING IT DID SEEM TO ME TO BECOME EVIDENT 
THAT THERE WAS PRESENT IN THE GEOMETRY OF IT 
SOMEWHERE IN THIS AREA 
THE PRESENCE OF WHAT COULD BE A REGULAR PENTAGON 
AND THE ANGLES OF THE PENTAGON 
THE NEXT STEP WAS TO JOIN THE OPPOSITE POINTS OF THE PENTAGON 
THIS MAKES A FIVE POINTED STAR 
WHAT COULD THIS IMPLY 
IN FACT WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PENTACLE 
AN ANCIENT SYMBOL OF THE OCCULT THE PENTACLE SEEMED TO INDICATE SOMETHING OF MAGICAL SIGNIFICANCE 
BUT THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
AS ITS TITLE SUGGESTS TARGETED A HIGHER PROFILE ARTIST 
IF YOU SAID NAME AN ARTIST TO A TOTAL STRANGER 
HE IS MORE LIKELY TO SAY LEONARDO D. A. VINCI THAN ANYTHING 
BESIDES THE D. A. VINCI CODE SOUNDS RATHER BETTER THAN THE REMBRANDT CODE 
OR THE RAPHAEL CODE DOESN'T IT D. A. VINCI 
D. A. VINCI A IT SCANS RATHER WELL 
AND B. THAT NAME BRINGS THAT KIND OF RESONANCE 
SO WE FEEL CLEVER BECAUSE WE ARE NOT SIMPLY BUYING AN AIRPORT THRILLER 
WE ARE BUYING INTO A WHOLE PACKAGE OF CULTURAL REFERENCES 
LEONARDO IS A FIGURE WHO ORCHESTRATED HIS MYSTIQUE EVEN DURING HIS OWN LIFETIME 
WE HAVE THESE CODED NOTE BOOKS IN MIRROR WRITING 
WE HAVE HIS DRAWINGS SO HE REMAINS A FASCINATING FIGURE 
WHO EACH GENERATION TRIES TO PUT BACK TOGETHER FOR THEMSELVES 
LEONARDO IS SURROUNDED BY MYTHS THAT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO WRITE SILLY THINGS 
LEONARDO IS ALWAYS SAID TO BE THE INVENTOR OF THE TANK THE INVENTOR OF THE AEROPLANE 
A MAN WHO UNDERSTOOD ABOUT AERIAL PERSPECTIVE 
HE DID BUT HE WAS NOT THE FIRST TO DO SO BY ANY MEANS 
AND LEONARDO IN HIS OWN LIFETIME WAS VERY KEEN TO PROMOTE HIMSELF 
PROMOTE HIMSELF AS A GENIUS WHO WAS FAR SUPERIOR 
TO HIS FELLOW FLORENTINS 
SHE MAY BE THE FACE I CAN'T FORGET 
IN THE D. A. VINCI CODE LEONARDO'S MONA LISA IS PORTRAYED 
AS ANDROGYNOUS IN CELEBRATION OF ONE OF THE BOOK'S THEMES 
HARMONY BETWEEN THE SEXES 
SHE MAY BE THE SONG THAT SUMMER SINGS 
MAY BE THE CHILL THAT AUTUMN BRINGS 
DAN BROWN TAKES A FAIRLY CONVENTIONAL ALMOST CARTOON LIKE READING OF THE MONA LISA 
I. E. THIS COMBINATION OF MASCULINITY AND FEMININITY 
AND THEN THROWS IN SOME WACKY IDEAS ABOUT 
EGYPTIAN REFERENCES AS WELL 
THIS IS ONLY ONE OF MANY WAYS IN WHICH THAT POOR PICTURE 
HAS BEEN ABUSED OVER THE CENTURIES 
SHE 
SHE 
IN FACT FAR FROM BEING AN ENIGMATIC PORTRAIT THE MONA LISA 
IS ONE OF THE MOST WELL RESEARCHED PAINTINGS IN THE WORLD 
WE KNOW WHO THE SITTER IS LISA DEL GIOCONDO WE KNOW SHE IS A DOCTOR'S WIFE 
WE KNOW THAT THE PICTURE WAS IN LEONARDO'S POSSESSION UNTIL HE DIED 
AND WE KNOW THAT IT CAME BACK INTO MILAN 
AMONGST THE POSSESSIONS OF ONE OF HIS FAVOURED APPRENTICES 
SO BIZARRELY IT IS ONE OF THE PICTURES THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN 
MUCH MYSTERY MUCH CLUES TO SECRET HIDDEN MEANINGS 
BUT WE WON'T LET IT GO 
BROWN LIKED THE IDEA OF CIPHERS SO MUCH 
THAT HE GAVE HIS TWO MAIN CHARACTERS COMPLEMENTARY CODE BREAKING SKILLS 
ROBERT LANGDON IS AN AMERICAN SYMBOLS EXPERT AND SOPHIE NEVEU 
IS A FRENCH CRYPTOGRAPHER WHO SUPPOSEDLY TRAINED AT ROYAL HOLLOWAY COLLEGE IN ENGLAND 
I USED TO JOKINGLY INTRODUCE MYSELF 
AS THE MAN WHO SUPERVISED SOPHIE NEVEU 
BUT THEN WAS ALARMED THAT ROUGHLY ONE IN FIVE 
PEOPLE ASKED ME WHAT SHE WAS LIKE 
SO THE BOOK HAS TAKEN OVER AND PEOPLE HAVE LOST REALITY IN FICTION 
SO I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE 
CODES ARE A PERFECT MATCH FOR THE THRILLER GENRE 
BECAUSE THEY CREATE MYSTERY BY CONCEALING REAL MEANINGS 
I SUSPECT THAT DAN BROWN LATCHED ONTO CODING THEORY BECAUSE 
HE RECOGNISED IT AS A SEXY TOPIC WITH POPULAR APPEAL 
I HAVE TO 
BREAK THE CODE 
I'M SORRY I AM VERY THICK 
I TOLD YOU MY SKILLS ON CODE BREAKING WERE ABSOLUTELY NIL 
NO IDEA 
PEOPLE LIKE IT THEY LIKE PUZZLE SOLVING AND THEY LIKE THE AIR OF MYSTERY 
THE CONCEPT OF THINGS BEING ENCRYPTED ADDS MYSTERY 
O. K. IT IS A ROW OF FLOWERS 
THIS IS ONE OF THE CLEVEREST THINGS ABOUT THE D. A. VINCI CODE IS THE USE OF CODES 
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE CHARACTERS HAPPENS TO THE READER 
YOU IDENTIFY WITH THEM AS A RESULT EVEN THOUGH THEY BEAR NO RESEMBLANCE TO ANY HUMAN I HAVE COME ACROSS 
THAT IS WHAT SUCKS YOU IN AND IT REWARDS YOU AS WELL 
IT MAKES YOU FEEL CLEVER IF YOU GET IT BEFORE THEM 
WHICH FRANKLY A LOT OF THE CODES ARE NOT EARTH SHATTERING SO YOU MIGHT WELL DO 
EIGHT ROSES 
IT'S A LINE OF EIGHT ROSES AND I'VE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT'S IN IT 
PRIOR TO NINETEEN SIXTY CODING THEORY WAS A BLACK ART WAS MAINLY 
CONFINED TO GOVERNMENTS AND SPIES AND MILITARY AND SO ON 
IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR WHEN 
NOT SURPRISINGLY ARMIES NEED TO COMMUNICATE AND THEY DON'T WANT 
THE ENEMY TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING SO THEY USED CODES 
THINGS LIKE THE ENIGMA AND THE ACTIVITIES AT BLETCHLEY PARK ARE NOW 
IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN BECAUSE THE THIRTY YEAR RULE IS UP AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY 
HAVE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THE POPULARISATION OF CRYPTOGRAPHY 
WITH THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET COMPUTERS TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
IT IS NOW PART OF EVERYDAY BUSINESS PRACTICE THIS IS POPULAR SCIENCE 
HOLY GRAIL OH 
AH THE ROSES OH YES 
YES THAT IS GOOD YES 
PART OF THE APPEAL OF THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
IS THAT IT OFFERS NEAT SOLUTIONS IN A MESSY WORLD 
YOU CAN GO TO WATERSTONE'S 
TAKE THE D. A. VINCI CODE OFF THE SHELF AND ESCAPE INTO THAT 
THERE IT COMES ALIVE FOR US BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD BOOK 
IT COMES ALIVE AND THERE WE ARE IN THE CONSPIRACY AND GETTING THE ANSWERS 
IT IS ALL RESOLVED AND WE COME AWAY SATISFIED 
AND THE WORLD SEEMS TO BE A BETTER PLACE 
THE BOOK ALSO PICKS UP 
ON THE CONTEMPORARY RISE OF CONSPIRACY THEORY 
AS WE'VE BECOME MORE SUSPICIOUS OF AUTHORITY FIGURES AND INSTITUTIONS 
ONE OF THE STRONG SELLING POINTS OF SOMETHING LIKE THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
IS THE IDEA THAT THERE IS AN OFFICIAL VERSION OF HISTORY 
WHICH THE AUTHORITIES GIVE US 
WHETHER THEY BE THE CHURCH AUTHORITIES 
OR THE GOVERNMENT OR SHADOWY OTHERS 
AND THEN A TRUE VERSION OF HISTORY 
A TRUE VERSION OF HISTORY WHICH WE CAN BE LET INTO 
EVENTS LIKE THE DEATH OF DIANA AND THE NINE ELEVEN ATTACKS 
HAVE INCREASED OUR FEELINGS OF SUSPICION 
AND THAT SITUATION BECAME INCREASINGLY ACUTE 
AFTER THE MILLENNIUM 
EVEN MORE AFTER THE EVENTS OF ELEVENTH SEPTEMBER 
WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMED INCREASINGLY UNCERTAIN 
WHEN PEOPLE DESPERATELY WANTED ANSWERS TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT SEEMED TO BE 
A GENERAL COLLAPSE OF EVERYTHING THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED AS STABLE AND SECURE 
I THINK THE SPREAD OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEDIA AND THE LACK OF TRUST IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEDIA 
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT POLITICAL SPIN OR NEWSPAPER BIAS OR INTERNET BLOGGING 
WHATEVER THE REASON PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO READ IN A DIFFERENT WAY 
THEY ARE STARTING TO THINK WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF THIS 
I THINK THE PARANOIA THAT LIES BEHIND THAT 
THE FEAR THAT IN FACT YOU MIGHT NOT BE BEING TOLD THE TRUTH 
UNDERPINS THE FASCINATION OF THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
WE ARE READIER TO BELIEVE 
THE STRANGE 
THE UNNATURAL THE GHOST STORY THAN WE ARE RATIONAL EXPLANATIONS 
ALL SIMPLY ORDINARY ALTERNATIVES 
OUR SUSCEPTIBILITY PROMPTED THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
TO MAKE CONSPIRACY THE SUBJECT OF HIS EASTER MESSAGE 
WE ARE INSTANTLY FASCINATED 
BY THE SUGGESTION OF CONSPIRACIES AND COVER UPS 
THIS HAS BECOME SO MUCH THE STUFF OF OUR IMAGINATION THESE DAYS 
THAT IT IS ONLY NATURAL IT SEEMS TO EXPECT IT 
WHEN WE TURN TO ANCIENT TEXTS ESPECIALLY BIBLICAL TEXTS 
THEY BELIEVE THERE IS THIS BIG FORCE OUT THERE WHETHER THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
OR OPUS DEI OR THE POPE HIMSELF DELIBERATELY KEEPING EVERYBODY IN IGNORANCE 
SO THAT NONE OF US WILL EVER KNOW THAT JESUS' BLOODLINE IS OUT THERE 
HIS CHILDREN ARE OUT THERE 
IF THEY ARE OUT THERE WHY AREN'T THEY OUT THERE DOING MIRACLES 
WHY AREN'T THEY SAVING THE WORLD 
AS A MAJOR INSTITUTION 
THE CHURCH IS FERTILE TERRITORY FOR CONSPIRACY THEORIES 
AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ESPECIALLY SO 
I THINK IT TAPS INTO ESPECIALLY IN THE ANGLO SAXON WORLD 
THE VERY ANCIENT ANTI CATHOLIC PREJUDICE 
THAT EXISTS VERY STRONGLY IN PARTS OF THE PROTESTANT IMAGINATION 
YOU WON'T SEE MUCH NEGATIVE IN THE BOOK ABOUT THE PROTESTANT CHURCH 
THE PREVIOUSLY LITTLE KNOWN CATHOLIC ORGANISATION OPUS DEI FOUND ITSELF 
DEMONISED IN THE D. A. VINCI CODE AS THE POWERFUL FORCE 
TRYING TO WIPE OUT THE PRIORY OF SION 
BROWN PRESENTS THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION IN HIS PREFACE 
IT SAYS FACT THE VATICAN PRELATURE KNOWN AS OPUS DEI IS A DEEPLY DEVOUT 
CATHOLIC SECT THAT HAS BEEN THE TOPIC OF RECENT CONTROVERSY 
DUE TO REPORTS OF BRAINWASHING COERCION AND A DANGEROUS PRACTICE KNOWN AS CORPORAL MORTIFICATION 
OPUS DEI REFUTES THAT DESCRIPTION 
THE MAIN CHARACTER OF OPUS DEI IN THE D. A. VINCI CODE IS A BRAINWASHED KILLER MONK 
NO IT IS NOT VERY NICE TO BE DEPICTED AS A BRAINWASHED KILLER MONK 
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONKS 
WE LOVE MONKS IN OPUS DEI BECAUSE WE ARE CATHOLICS BUT 
THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF MONKS IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
BUT OPUS DEI ISN'T ONE OF THE ORGANISATIONS CONTAINING MONKS 
I KNOW OPUS DEI I AM NOT MYSELF 
A MEMBER OF OPUS DEI BUT I KNOW OPUS DEI 
THEY ARE 
DECENT WELL MEANING 
RATHER RIGID RATHER TOO RIGID FOR MY TASTE CATHOLICS 
THE OPUS DEI MOVEMENT BEGAN IN SPAIN 
MADRID NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT 
IN THAT YEAR A YOUNG PRIEST IN A WORKING CLASS DISTRICT FOUNDED AN ORGANISATION 
INTENDED TO HELP ORDINARY CATHOLICS DEDICATE THEIR DAILY LIVES TO GOD 
THE NAME OF THE PRIEST WAS JOSE MARIA ESCRIVA DE BALAGUER 
AND THE ORGANISATION WAS OPUS DEI GOD'S WORK 
DURING THE TURBULENCE OF THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR 
OPUS DEI OFFERED STABILITY AND STRUCTURE 
IN SPAIN UNDER FRANCO 
OPUS DEI BECAME RATHER LIKE FREEMASONRY WITHOUT THE SECRECY 
IT WAS AN ENERGETIC DILIGENT FUNDAMENTALLY A POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY 
SOCIALISTS AS WELL AS FRANCO'S SUPPORTERS WERE OPUS DEI MEMBERS 
AND IT APPEALED TO THE PROFESSIONAL CLASSES 
OPUS DEI EXPANDED RAPIDLY 
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES SEVEN MEMBERS 
OF THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT WERE OPUS DEI MEN 
IF YOU WANTED TO GET ON IN BUSINESS 
YOU JOINED THE OPUS DEI 
FOR THAT REASON THE OPUS DEI GOT A NAME IN SPAIN 
WHICH I DON'T THINK IT DESERVES ELSEWHERE 
WHEN OPUS DEI REACHED BRITAIN 
IT NOW HAS FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS IT MADE HEADLINES FOR ENCOURAGING 
ITS MEMBERS TO PRACTICE CORPORAL MORTIFICATION 
BROWN'S KILLER MONK REVELS MASOCHISTICALLY 
IN THE WEARING OF A SPIKED METAL BAND ON HIS LEG CALLED A CILICE 
THE THING TO THINK ABOUT CORPORAL MORTIFICATION 
IS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
IS GROSSLY DISTORTED AND IS NOT PUT IN CONTEXT 
THE CONTEXT IS THAT TO BE A CHRISTIAN 
CHRIST SAID YOU HAVE TO PRAY FAST AND DO GOOD WORKS 
THESE ARE THE THREE THINGS THAT CHRISTIANS DO 
AND WITHIN FASTING AND SELF DENIAL THERE IS A LONG TRADITION 
SO CORPORAL MORTIFICATION HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN 
THE CONTEXT OF ALL SACRIFICES WHERE MOST OF LIFE'S SACRIFICES ARE SMALL 
SOMETIMES THEY ARE BODILY THINGS 
LIKE WEARING A CILICE AT THE TOP OF YOUR LEG 
WHICH CAUSES DISCOMFORT 
BUT DOESN'T DRAW ANY BLOOD OR HARM YOU IN ANY WAY 
AND YOU OFFER THAT DISCOMFORT TO GOD IN THE SAME WAY AS YOU OFFER THE FASTING 
NOT EATING OR SLEEPING ROUGH OR WALKING BAREFOOT 
THIS IS VERY FAR REMOVED FROM THE TYPE OF MASOCHISTIC 
GRUESOME REPRESENTATIONS YOU FIND IN THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
BROWN'S BIGGEST CONSPIRACY THEORY OF ALL 
IS THAT JESUS INTENDED WOMEN TO HAVE A POWERFUL PLACE IN HIS MINISTRY 
ACCORDING TO THESE UNALTERED GOSPELS 
IT WAS NOT PETER TO WHOM CHRIST GAVE DIRECTIONS WITH WHICH TO ESTABLISH 
THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH IT WAS MARY MAGDALENE 
SOPHIE LOOKED AT HIM 
YOU'RE SAYING THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH WAS TO BE CARRIED ON BY A WOMAN 
THAT WAS THE PLAN JESUS WAS THE ORIGINAL FEMINIST 
ONE THEME OF THE BOOK WHICH PARTICULARLY APPEALS TO FEMALE READERS 
IS THE IDEA OF A WOMAN AT THE CENTRE OF CHRISTIANITY 
PERHAPS THIS IS NO SURPRISE GIVEN THAT THE COURT CASE REVEALED 
THAT DAN BROWN'S WIFE BLYTHE DID MUCH OF HIS RESEARCH 
HE REALLY EXTOLS THE FEMININE IN EARLY CHRISTIANITY 
AND ALSO APPEARS TO BLAME THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
FOR WRITING FEMALE SEXUALITY OUT OF ITS DOCTRINE 
ADMITTEDLY WHATEVER THE RIGHTS AND WRONGS OF THE D. A. VINCI CODE IN DOING THIS 
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT 
FOR WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE AGES BY ELEVATING 
AS ITS MOST PROMINENT WOMAN THE VIRGIN MARY 
A VIRGIN WHO HAS A CHILD HOW MUCH MORE IMPOSSIBLE CAN LIFE GET 
THERE IS AN ARGUMENT AS TO WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE WOMEN PRIESTS 
SO THE IDEA THAT ACTUALLY MARY MAGDALENE WAS CHRIST'S LOVER AND SIRES A GENERATION 
WHICH THEN CONTINUES TO THIS DAY 
IS A PERFECT WAY OF FEMINISING CHRISTIANITY AT EXACTLY THE MOMENT 
WHEN A GREAT MANY WOMEN AND SOME MEN 
ARE SAYING THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO IT 
SO EVEN IF IT'S NOT TRUE 
THE SPECULATION FITS INTO ENDLESS DISCUSSIONS THAT WE ARE ALREADY HAVING 
IT IS VERY MUCH TRYING TO CELEBRATE AND BRING BACK THE FEMININE DIVINE 
WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE I AM WICCAN SO I BELIEVE IN THAT 
THAT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS MENTIONED A LOT IN THE BOOK 
SO THAT WAS REALLY GOOD TO READ 
BROWN ATTEMPTED TO PROVE THE IMPORTANCE OF MARY MAGDALENE 
BY CLAIMING THAT LEONARDO PAINTED HER 
INTO THE LAST SUPPER ON CHRIST'S RIGHT HAND 
SOPHIE COULD NOT TAKE HER EYES FROM THE WOMAN BESIDE CHRIST 
THE LAST SUPPER IS SUPPOSED TO BE THIRTEEN MEN WHO IS THIS WOMAN 
ALTHOUGH SOPHIE HAD SEEN THIS CLASSIC IMAGE MANY TIMES 
SHE HAD NOT NOTICED THIS DISCREPANCY 
EVERYONE MISSES IT TEAPING SAID 
OUR PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OF THIS SCENE ARE SO POWERFUL 
THAT OUR MINDS BLANK OUT THE INCONGRUITY AND OVERRIDES OUR EYES 
IT IS KNOWN AS SCOTOMA LANGDON ADDED 
THE BRAIN DOES IT SOMETIMES WITH POWERFUL SYMBOLS 
BROWN'S CLAIMS HAVE EVEN MADE ART HISTORIANS DO A DOUBLE TAKE 
I HAVE BEEN BACK TO LOOK AT THE LAST SUPPER 
WITH A FIERCELY ANALYTICAL EYE 
THIS IS WHAT HE THINKS CAN I SEE IT 
NOT THIS IS WHAT HE THINKS I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT BUT CAN I SEE IT 
CAN I SEE IN THAT PICTURE WHAT HE SEES 
AND SPENDING A WHOLE DAY 
VIRTUALLY ON MY OWN 
IN CONTEMPLATION OF THAT PICTURE 
I SEE ABSOLUTELY NO FOUNDATION TO ANY OF HIS IDEAS ABOUT IT 
TO TRY TO ARGUE THAT ONE FIGURE IS FEMALE 
OTHER FIGURES ARE MALE DOESN'T WORK 
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACES THEY ARE QUITE SIMILAR 
AND THE SO CALLED MARY MAGDALENE 
AND THE FEATURES OF CHRIST ARE INDEED ALMOST IDENTICAL 
THEIR LONG FLOWING HAIR IN THIS PERIOD 
DOES NOT INDICATE FEMALENESS 
THERE IS A REAL CONFUSION OVER WHAT THE LATE FIFTEENTH EARLY SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
UNDERSTOOD TO BE FEMALE DRESS 
WHAT THEY ARE UNDERSTOOD TO BE MALE DRESS 
AND THIS BOOK JUST HASN'T GOT IT THERE 
DAN BROWN HAS QUITE CYNICALLY PRESSED THE FEMINIST BUTTON 
WONDERFUL HERE YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF THE LAST SUPPER OF THIRTEEN MEN 
AND ONE OF THEM HAS SUDDENLY TURNED INTO A WOMAN 
NOT ONLY A WOMAN BUT A WOMAN WITH A PAST 
AND A PROSTITUTE REDEEMED BY THE COMPANY OF CHRIST HIMSELF 
ALL THOSE WHO THINK WE SHOULD HAVE WOMEN PRIESTS AND WOMEN BISHOPS 
AND EVEN A WOMAN ARCHBISHOP 
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER WILL REJOICE 
IN THE PRESENCE OF MAGDALENE AT THE LAST SUPPER 
THE NOVEL COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN FOR ALL THOSE SILLY WOMEN 
EVEN IF THERE WAS A SECRET MESSAGE IN THE LAST SUPPER 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE TO HAVE SURVIVED 
FRESCO PAINTINGS WERE AN EXTREMELY FRAGILE MEDIUM 
WHERE SPEED WAS OF THE ESSENCE 
LEONARDO HALFWAY THROUGH THE PAINTING 
WOULD GO AND SPEND A WHOLE DAY JUST LOOKING AT IT 
GAZING AT HIS OWN WORK 
AND THEN PUT ONE TINY TOUCH OF PAINT ON AND GO AWAY 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A FRESCO 
THE WHOLE BUSINESS 
WITH PAINTING A FRESCO MEANS THAT YOU PAINT ON DAMP PLASTER 
YOU DO NOT COME BACK THREE WEEKS LATER 
CONTEMPLATE AND PUT A DRY TOUCH OF PAINT 
ON DRY PLASTER AND GO AWAY IT FALLS OFF 
THE FRESCO DISINTEGRATED RAPIDLY 
AND WAS GREATLY ALTERED BY HEAVY HANDED REPAIRS OVER THE CENTURIES 
A RECENT RESTORATION REVEALS HOW LITTLE OF LEONARDO'S ORIGINAL WORK REMAINS 
WHAT WE HAVE IN THE LAST SUPPER TODAY IS A GHOST OF ITS FORMER SELF 
WE ARE SEEING VERY MUCH THE UNDER UNDER 
UNDER PAINT OF WHAT WAS A VERY COMPLEX AND HIGHLY BUILT UP PICTURE 
BROWN BASED HIS THESIS ABOUT MARY MAGDALENE ON A SERIES OF GOSPELS 
DISCOVERED IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE IN EGYPT WHICH ARE KNOWN AS THE GNOSTIC GOSPELS 
THEY WERE WRITTEN SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE NEW TESTAMENT 
AND CREATE A VERY DIFFERENT IMAGE OF MARY MAGDALENE 
THEY PAINT A PICTURE OF MARY AS A SIGNIFICANT WOMAN 
IN THE EARLY CHURCH IN CONFLICT WITH PETER AND THE DISCIPLES 
ONE WHOM JESUS LOVED 
AND THEREFORE SPENT TIME WITH AND GAVE KNOWLEDGE TO 
BUT THERE ARE SOME TEASING OMISSIONS TO THE TEXTS WHICH WERE DAMAGED BY ANTS 
AND HE KISSED HER 
THAT WE HAVE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS LINE ON HER 
AND THEN THERE IS A LACUNA AND OF COURSE THIS LACUNA 
MISSING TEXT HAS BEEN THE OBJECT OF QUITE A BIT OF SPECULATION BY SCHOLARS 
WHERE EXACTLY DID HE KISS HER 
MOST LIKELY ON THE MOUTH AND THAT CAN BE RESTORED HERE 
ON THE BASIS OF COPTIC GRAMMAR AND THE LENGTH OF THE LACUNA 
WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE 
IN THE GNOSTIC GOSPEL OF PHILIP 
THERE'S A VERY INTERESTING PASSAGE 
WHERE JESUS AND MARY MAGDALENE HAVE A PASSIONATE SNOG BASICALLY 
THE DISCIPLES GET VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS THE WATCHING DISCIPLES AND SAY JESUS MASTER 
WHY DO YOU LOVE HER MORE THAN YOU LOVE US 
AND JESUS SAYS NO NO YOU ARE GETTING THE QUESTION THE WRONG WAY ROUND 
WHAT YOU MUST ASK YOURSELVES IS WHY DO I NOT LOVE YOU AS MUCH AS I LOVE HER 
THIS TALE WOULD SEEM TO UNDERMINE CHRIST'S FEMINIST CREDENTIALS 
ALL THE GOSPELS EVEN THE GNOSTIC ONES 
HE NEVER HAS A FEMALE DISCIPLE AMONG THE TWELVE 
AND MARY EVEN AT THE MOST LIBERAL EXPRESSION 
YOU CAN TAKE OF THE GNOSTIC GOSPELS 
IS A SEX OBJECT TO HIM BASICALLY 
SO IT IS NOT IDEAL 
EVEN IN THE GNOSTIC CHRISTIANITY THE WAY THAT WOMEN ARE REPRESENTED 
TODAY THE GNOSTICS ARE VIEWED AS THE NEW AGE BELIEVERS OF THEIR DAY 
SEEKING A DIRECT COMMUNION WITH A HIGHER POWER 
THIS COLOURED THEIR WRITINGS ABOUT EVENTS THAT HAPPENED CENTURIES BEFORE 
ONE THE THINGS THAT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE ABOUT GNOSTIC BELIEFS 
IS THAT THEY DO SEEM TO OFFER KNOWLEDGE 
ESPECIALLY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE TRANSCENDENT 
ABOUT THE SUPERNATURAL AND THEY OFFER PATHWAYS TO KNOWLEDGE THROUGH DOORWAYS THROUGH MYSTERIES 
AT ONE POINT IN THE D. A. VINCI CODE SOPHIE NEVEU IS CARRYING THIS KEY AROUND 
THAT IS THE ANSWER TO THE MYSTERY THAT IS WHAT THE GNOSTIC RELIGIONS OFFER 
THEY OFFER THE KEY TO THE MYSTERIES OF LIFE 
THE FACT THE GNOSTIC GOSPELS WERE LEFT OUT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT 
HAS FED THE IDEA THAT THE OFFICIAL CHURCH 
TRIED TO BURY MARY MAGDALENE'S IMPORTANCE 
THE CHURCH DIDN'T NEED TO SUPPRESS THEM 
THEY FELL INTO DISUSE OF THEIR OWN ACCORD 
THE REAL GOSPELS WERE VERY MUCH USED AND THE OTHERS FELL INTO DISUSE 
THEY WERE NOT IMPORTANT THE PEOPLE DIDN'T TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY 
NO ONE REPUTABLE WOULD TREAT 
THE GOSPEL OF SAINT MARY MAGDALENE IN THE SAME LIGHT 
AS MARK MATTHEW LUKE AND JOHN 
ALTHOUGH THE MARY MAGDALENE STORY IS A CONSPIRACY THEORY 
THE MODERN CHURCH BOTH CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT 
HAS BEEN ALARMED AT THE PUBLIC RECEPTION OF BROWN'S STORY 
THE HERESY THAT HE HAS REVIVED IN THIS BOOK 
IS ONE THAT GOES BACK TO THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THE CHURCH 
IS ONE THE CHURCH SPENT A LOT OF MONEY 
TIME AND A LOT OF LIVES SUPPRESSING 
AND THE CHURCH IS ALARMED BECAUSE IT KNOWS THAT THIS HERESY WAS VERY 
VERY POWERFUL AND VERY POTENT EARLY ON 
AND WAS CAPABLE OF ATTRACTING PEOPLE TO IT 
SO AGAIN NATURALLY IT HAS FRIGHTENED THEM TO SEE IT 
TAKING HOLD OF THE PUBLIC IMAGINATION 
IN QUITE SUCH A POWERFUL WAY ONCE AGAIN 
THE BOOK AT ONE LEVEL IS NONSENSE 
IT IS HISTORICALLY INACCURATE 
BUT ON ANOTHER LEVEL 
IT TOUCHES NERVES WITH THE CHURCH AND HALF TRUTHS ARE THERE 
WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND IT BECAME CLEAR THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
WERE READING THIS BOOK THE CATHOLIC CHURCH RESPONDED IN A FEARFUL WAY 
AN AGGRESSIVE WAY A DEFENSIVE WAY 
DISMISSING IT AS FANTASY AS RUBBISH AS NONSENSE 
THERE ARE GOOD REASONS WHY READERS OF THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
ARE PREPARED TO QUESTION THE TRADITIONAL DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH 
THE BEST THING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT THIS DISCUSSION IS THAT IT REMINDS PEOPLE 
THAT THERE ARE PRACTICALLY NO SOURCES FOR WHAT EXISTS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT 
THERE'S PRACTICALLY NOTHING TO SUGGEST THAT ANY ONE ACCOUNT IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER ACCOUNT 
AND THAT HAS ALLOWED PEOPLE TO COME IN AND SAY MY VERSION OF THIS I NOW GIVE YOU 
IS ACTUALLY AS GOOD AND AS WELL SOURCED AS THE ONE WHICH EVERYBODY IS LED TO ACCEPT 
I THINK YOU COULD PROBABLY ARGUE THAT THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH 
AS IT MOVES FROM EARLY REALITY 
INTO INSTITUTIONALISED POWER WAS ALWAYS ONE WHERE THERE WAS A LOT 
OF SLIPPAGE BETWEEN WHAT THE DOCTRINE BECAME AND WHAT THE REALITY BECAME 
THE D. A. VINCI CODE ALSO TAPS INTO THE SPIRITUAL UNCERTAINTY 
AND DISTRUST OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
I'M LOST AND LONELY LIKE YOU'VE LOST ALL HOPE 
AND YOUR SANITY 
MY OWN THEORY FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH IS THAT OVER THE LAST TWO CENTURIES 
IN WESTERN CULTURE AT ANY RATE 
RELIGION AND SECULARISM HAVE FOUGHT EACH OTHER TO A STANDSTILL 
AND PEOPLE 
BELIEVE IN SCIENCE AS LITTLE AS THEY BELIEVE IN RELIGION 
AND WE ARE LEFT WITH 
NEITHER SIDE HAVING WON IN A KIND OF VACUUM 
WE HAVE A DUTY WE REALLY HAVE A DUTY 
PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF WHO DO GENUINELY AND HEARTFELT LY BELIEVE 
WHAT THE GOSPELS AND THE CHURCH TELL US 
WE HAVE A CHARGE TO RECOGNISE 
THAT THE STORY WE ARE TELLING IS TO OUR GENERATION FRANKLY BARMY 
LET US BE HONEST AND THEN WE MIGHT AT LEAST HAVE A REAL DIALOGUE 
WITH THOSE WHO WONDER WHY DO WE TELL THIS STORY 
THE PERCEIVED THREAT OF DAN BROWN'S VERSION OF THE CHRIST STORY 
HAS UNITED MANY BRANCHES OF THE CHURCH IN A COUNTER OFFENSIVE 
WITH GREAT APLOMB THEY'RE RIDING THE TAIL OF D. A. VINCI CODE TOURISM 
TO GET PEOPLE THROUGH THEIR DOORS 
LINCOLN CATHEDRAL HAS SEEN VISITOR NUMBERS RISE SINCE IT PLAYED HOST 
TO THE FEATURE FILM FOR IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED A SIX FIGURE SUM 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO JUST SAY NO 
AND THAT WAS A REAL OPTION 
BECAUSE IF THE FILM COMES OUT IT PAINTS CHRISTIANITY IN THIS LIGHT 
PEOPLE GO TO THE FILM THEY DON'T BELIEVE AS A RESULT OF THAT 
THEN THAT WOULD HARM OUR MISSION AND THE MISSION OF THE CHURCH 
IT WAS A DIFFICULT DECISION AND OTHERS THOUGHT 
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE PROCEEDED BUT WE DID 
ON THE BASIS THAT WE FELT THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING WE HAD TO ENGAGE WITH 
BUT TO HAVE HAD QUITE SUCH A RESPONSE SUCH AN ACTIVE RESPONSE 
ON THE WEB ON TELEVISION 
ON THE RADIO IN BOOKS THIS IS ALL TO THE GOOD 
I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I HAVE JOINED THE FRAY 
NOT ONLY DO I GIVE MY WEEKLY TALK ON FRIDAYS I HAVE WRITTEN A SHORT BOOK ABOUT IT 
EVEN OPUS DEI IS TAKING A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TO THE NEGATIVE PUBLICITY 
WITH THE D. A. VINCI CODE WE HAVE HAD A HUGE AMOUNT OF INTEREST 
FOR EXAMPLE OUR WEBSITE HAD ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND HITS IN TWO THOUSAND THREE 
AND ONE MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
SO A TENFOLD INCREASE 
SO FOR ALL ITS FEARS IT APPEARS AS IF THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
MIGHT BENEFIT THE CHURCH IN THE LONG RUN 
EVEN THOUGH IT IS FICTION 
IN FORTY TO FIFTY YEARS PEOPLE WILL STILL BE TALKING ABOUT IT 
IT IS A SEMINAL BOOK THEY WILL LOOK BACK AND SEE THIS 
AS A LIFE CHANGING ERA FOR THE WORLD AND FOR THE CHURCH I DON'T THINK THAT'S PUTTING IT TOO STRONGLY 
VISITOR NUMBERS HAVE ALSO INCREASED TO THE GALLERIES OF LONDON AND PARIS 
DOES IT MATTER THAT A THRILLER 
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS RENAISSANCE IN ART APPRECIATION 
IF YOU GO TO THE LOUVRE TO SEE THE MONA LISA 
ARE ALL THOSE PEOPLE STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU LOOKING AT THIS PICTURE 
PRODUCED IN FLORENCE IN THE EARLY SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
ARE THEY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE PICTURE OR ARE THEY SAYING 
TICKED OFF THAT CLUE LET ME RUSH OFF TO MILAN NOW AND TICK OFF THAT CLUE 
THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES DAN BROWN'S BOOK IMPORTANT 
IN THE FIELD OF LEONARDO'S STUDIES 
IS THE RIP ROARING SUCCESS THAT IT HAS BEEN 
NOBODY WHO HAS EVER WRITTEN A SERIOUS BOOK ON LEONARDO 
HAS HAD ANYTHING LIKE THE SUCCESS 
AND DAN BROWN'S HYPOTHESES HAVE DISRUPTED 
THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PICTURE 
THEREFORE IT DOES MATTER 
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS 
D. A. VINCI CODE MANIA HAS DOMINATED OUR CULTURE IN EXTRAORDINARY WAYS 
THE FACT THAT A NOVEL CAN WREAK SUCH HAVOC WITH OUR SENSE OF REALITY 
PERHAPS REVEALS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT OUR STATE OF MIND AT THE TURN OF THE MILLENNIUM 
WHAT THE D. A. VINCI CODE IS DOING IS 
IT IS 
I HATE TO USE THE WORD EXPLOIT BECAUSE I AM NOT SURE THAT IS THE CORRECT WORD 
FOR WHAT THE AUTHOR CONSIDERED HE WAS DOING 
BUT THE EFFECT IS IT EXPLOITS ILLUSIONS 
IT PRESENTS THESE ILLUSIONS WHICH SO MANY PEOPLE 
BELIEVE IN AND CREATES A STORY OUT OF THEM 
I DON'T BLAME THE AUTHOR FOR DOING THIS 
HE HAS MADE AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY 
OUT OF IT THAT IS HIS RIGHT 
BUT NEVERTHELESS WHAT HE IS DOING IS EXPLOITING THOSE ILLUSIONS 
THAT IS ALL HE IS DOING 
AND I JUST FEEL VERY VERY SORRY 
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE WHAT THEY READ IN THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT 
FOR I IMAGINE MILLIONS OF READERS NOW 
WHO HAVE NO OTHER ACCESS TO 
THE REALITIES OF THE STORY OF LEONARDO 
TO BELIEVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE D. A. VINCI CODE 
IT IS SUCH A DISTORTION 
THAT IS WHY I DEPLORE IT A NOVEL IS FINE 
IN FACT WHAT I THINK I AM DEPLORING 
IS THE SUCCESS OF THE NOVEL RATHER THAN THE NOVEL ITSELF 
AND FOR THAT ONE CAN'T BLAME DAN BROWN 
SO CAN WE BLAME HIS PUBLISHERS RANDOM HOUSE 
IT'S INTERESTING PEOPLE SAY THE BOOK HAS SOLD THIS MANY MILLION HARDBACKS IN AMERICA 
ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S DONE THAT 
IS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BUY IT IN PAPERBACK IN AMERICA 
SOME OF THIS IS MARKETING 
VERY CREATIVE SUCCESSFUL POWERFUL MARKETING 
BUT IT'S NOT AS IF THIS IS THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVING ON THE WATERS 
THIS IS CAPITALISM 
IN FACT THE AMERICAN PAPERBACK HAS JUST COME OUT 
COINCIDING WITH RANDOM HOUSE'S SUCCESSFUL DEFENCE AGAINST PLAGIARISM CLAIMS 
I'D LIKE TO THANK DAN BROWN FOR HIS PATIENCE 
AND FOR HIS TREMENDOUS SUPPORT THROUGH THIS TRIAL 
RENEWED INTEREST IN THE GRAIL STORY HAS PUT THE D. A. VINCI CODE BACK 
ON THE BESTSELLER LISTS SHIFTING TWENTY THOUSAND COPIES A WEEK 
WHILE THE HOLY BLOOD AND THE HOLY GRAIL 
WHICH IS ALSO FROM THE RANDOM HOUSE STABLE 
HAS SEEN A ONE HUNDRED PER CENT INCREASE IN SALES SOME TWENTY FOUR YEARS AFTER PUBLICATION 
IT PROMPTED THE JUDGE TO REFER TO SPECULATION 
THAT THE WHOLE TRIAL WAS A GIANT PUBLICITY STUNT 
CONSPIRACY THEORY ANYONE 
IT IS A MESSAGE THAT HAS BEEN HIDDEN 
FOR ALL OF US 
AND MOST PEOPLE WE KNEW IT WAS A RUNNING JOKE 
ERM IN FACT EARLY ON IT WAS SUGGESTED BY SOMEBODY ON THEIR SIDE 
UM JOKINGLY 
TAKE OUT AN INJUNCTION AND BOTH BOOKS WILL PROFIT 
BUT REALISTICALLY NO 
THERE WAS NO SUCH CONSPIRACY 
IT'S PERFECT IT'S GOT FANTASTIC TIMING AT THE MOMENT 
THE COURT CASE HAS ABSOLUTELY BROUGHT IT INTO PERFECT PROMINENCE 
WHICH IS SEAMLESSLY MOVING INTO THE PAPERBACK 
I'M NOT CLAIMING THEY ARE DELIBERATE 
I'M JUST CLAIMING THAT THE SECRET OF THIS STRANGE HOLY GRAIL CONTINUES 
MUCH MORE WORRYING IS THAT I'M TOLD 
THAT DAN BROWN'S NEXT BOOK IS ABOUT THE FREEMASONS 
YOU CANNOT WRITE ABOUT THE FREEMASONS 
WITHOUT WRITING ABOUT THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR 
I THINK IT'S ALL GOING TO START AGAIN
