ABOUT SIXTEEN YEAR OLD PAIGE CHIVERS 
SHE HAD BEEN MISSING FROM HOME FOR 
EIGHT MONTHS NOW LIKE ANY TEENAGER 
SHE HAD THE ODD ARGUMENT WITH HER 
DAD NO ONE EXPECTED WHAT SHE WOULD 
DO NEXT 
BLACKPOOL IN LANCASHIRE IS HOME TO 
TEENAGER PAIGE CHIVERS 
MORE THAN NINE MONTHS AGO SHE 
LEAVES HER FATHER'S HOUSE AFTER AN 
ARGUMENT OVER MONEY THE POLICE ARE 
NOW SEARCHING FOR HER 
WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO FRANK CHIVERS 
PAIGE'S DAD TO KEEP HIM UPDATED 
HE MIGHT HAVE FURTHER INFORMATION 
FOR US IN RELATION TO PAIGE 
EVERYTHING WAS FINE I WOKE HER UP 
TO GO TO SCHOOL THE USUAL GIVE 
HER A SHOUT GET YOURSELF READY 
I'M UP I'M UP 
YOU RETURNED HOME 
ON THAT DAY THE TWENTY THIRD YEAH WHAT YEAH WHAT HAPPENED THEN JACK WAS AT HOME 
WASN'T HE 
JACK WAS AT HOME PAIGE 
WAS GONE WHAT DO YOU MEAN PAIGE 
IS GONE HE SAID SHE TOOK TWO 
CARRIER BAGS AND LEFT 
DID HE SAY 
WHERE SHE WAS GOING 
SHE WALKED 
DOWN LONGED FOR AVENUE TOWARDS 
ASHFIELD ROAD AND I'VE NOT SEEN HER 
SINCE SINCE SEE YOU LATER FRANK BYE BYE BYE BYE BYE BYE PAIM HAS FIVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS 
SHE'S JUST SIXTEEN 
I WAS SIX WHEN PAIGE CAME ALONG 
VERY OUTGOING INTERESTED IN MUSIC 
VERY OUTGOING A LITTLE BIT 
MISCHIEVOUS AS WELL 
SHE RHYS A 
VERY BONNY PERSON SHE WAS ALWAYS 
POLITE SHE WOULD ALWAYS SAY THANK 
YOU AND STUFF SHE WOULD ALWAYS ASK 
BEFORE SHE DID ANYTHING SHE DID 
HER FAIR SHARE IF THERE WAS 
WASHING UP AND SHE HAD STAYED FOR 
TEA SHE WOULD HAVE TO HELP WASHUP 
SUNDAY DINNERS SHE WOULD ALWAYS BE 
AROUND FOR SUNDAY DINNERS SHE USED 
TO LOVE HER SUNDAY DINNERS IN IN FEBRUARY LAST YEAR PAIGE'S MUM 
SHEILA DIES SUDDENLY THE FAMILY 
SPLITS PAIGE AND HER YOUNGER 
BROTHER JACK ARE THE LAST TWO 
CHILDREN STILL LIVING AT HOME 
FRANK GOT NEW GIRLFRIEND HE WENT 
HIS OWN WAY BASICALLY SO THE 
CHILDREN WENT THEIR OWN WAY 
LOSING HER MUM SO YOUNG HAS HIT 
PAIGE ESPECIALLY HARD 
CERTAINLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE KNOWN 
PAIGE FOR MANY YEARS SAID THERE WAS 
A CHANGE IN HER SHE DID APPEAR 
VERY DOWN YES HER AND HER MUM 
USED TO FALL OUT FROM TIME TO TIME 
BUT I'M GATHERING THAT THERE WAS 
QUITE A CLOSE BOND THERE 
THE BUS STOP WE ARE APPROACHING ON 
THE LEFT HERE IS THE BUS STOP THAT 
PAIGE WAS LAST SIGHTED AT THE LAST 
CONFIRMED SIGHTING OF HER WHEN SHE 
WAS IN COMPANY WITH MALE SHE WAS 
WEARING WHITE CROPPED TROUSERS AND 
A BROWN COLOURED GILLET THAT IS 
THE LAST CONFIRMED SIGHTING WE HAVE 
OF PAIGE 
OVER THE LAST NINE MONTHS THERE 
HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS UNCONFIRMED 
SIGHTINGS OF PAIGE 
THERE HAVE BEEN 
PEOPLE SAYING THEY'VE SEEN HER IN 
BLACKPOOL AND VARIOUS OTHER PARTS 
OF THE COUNTRY WHAT CREDIBILITY WE 
CAN PUT ON THOSE SIGHTINGS IS A 
VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION FOR US 
OBVIOUSLY IF SOMEBODY SAYS I'M A 
RELATIVE OF PAIGE OR WE'RE IN 
THE SAME CLASS AT SCHOOL WE HAVE 
PUT A WEIGHT ON THOSE SIGHTINGS 
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF 
SIGHTINGS SINCE THE END OF AUGUST 
MY CONCERN FOR PAIGE TENDS TO BE 
THAT ON THE OUTSIDE SHE GIVES OFF A 
VERY CONFIDENT CHEEKY IN YOUR FACE 
TYPE OF APPROACH BUT PERHAPS 
BENEATH NOT QUITE AS CONFIDENT AND 
CERTAINLY NOT AS STREET WISE AS SHE 
PROBABLY THINKS SHE IS THAT'S WHEN 
IT BECOMES A DANGEROUS MIX WE DO 
KNOW THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE SHE 
HAS ASSOCIATED WITH OVER THE LAST 
YEAR OR SO ARE PEOPLE SHE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF NOT 
ASSOCIATING WITH 
PAIGE NOW HATS A NEPHEW CONNOR HE 
WAS BORN IN OCTOBER SHORTLY AFTER 
SHE WENT MISSING 
HE'S JUST A BUNDLE OF JOY 
EVERYTHING WHAT I WANTED HE IS MY 
LITTLE TREASURE HE IS HE 
ABSOLUTELY IS I JUST WANT PAIGE TO 
COME AND MEET HIM 
I JUST WANT HER BACK I'M ALWAYS 
HERE FOR HER EVERYBODY IS HERE FOR 
HER DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IF 
SHE WANTS TO COME AND SPEAK TOO ONE 
OF US WE'RE ALWAYS HERE FOR HER 
ON THE PHONE NOW IS DETECTIVE 
INSPECTOR MARTIN CLAY WHO HAS BEEN 
DEALING WITH PAIGE'S CASE GOOD 
MORNING MARTIN ARE YOU THERE 
GOOD MORNING 
WHAT IS THE LATEST IN 
THIS INVESTIGATION 
THE LATEST WE 
HAVE SO FAR IS WE HAVE HAD A SMALL 
CLUSTER OF POTENTIAL SIGHTINGS OF 
PAIGE IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND 
AREA AREA THAT'S SOME DISTANCE FROM WHERE SHE 
HAS GONE MISSING FROM HOW ARE YOU 
DEALING WITH THOSE 
AS I SAY 
THEY'RE REPORTED SIGHTINGS THEY 
WILL REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION 
WE NEED TO CORROBORATE THAT WITH 
OTHER EVIDENCE WE HAVE 
YOU WILL BE 
LINKING UP WITH POLICE FORCE THERE 
IS IS THERE ANYTHING OF MAJOR 
SIGNIFICANCE 
NOT AT THIS STAGE SIGNIFICANCE THE ONLY BIT OF A CLUE FOR US IS 
THAT SOME OF THE SIGHTINGS DO 
INCLUDE A TATTOO SIMILAR TO THE ONE 
WE KNOW PAIGE HAS ON THE BACK OF 
HER NECK 
WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
THAT IS A QUITE A DISTINCTIVE 
TATTOO IT'S THE BUNNY RABBIT ON 
THE BACK OF HER NECK IF SOMEBODY 
THINKS THEY HAVE SEEN THAT THAT 
COULD BE ENCOURAGING 
INDEED EACH 
ONE WILL HAVE TO BE INVESTIGATED IN 
DETAIL TO ESTABLISH THE TRUTH IN 
THAT SIGHTING 
BEST OF LUCK WITH 
THAT APPEAL 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IF YOU CAN HELP PLEASE CALL 
MISSING PEOPLE THE NUMBER IS OH FIVE OH OH 
SEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED

CONVERTED ROOM WE CALLED HIM FOR 
TEA AND THEN WE REALISED HE WASN'T 
IN THE HOUSE

WASN'T RIGHT SO WE THEN KICKED 
THINGS INTO MOTION AND WE PHONED 
THE POLICE 
THE SEARCH FOR ANDREW 
GOSDEN IS NOW A TOP PRIORITY FOR 
SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE 
ANDREW WAS CATEGORISED AS 
VULNERABLE HIGH RISK MISSING FROM

WHEN HIS PARENTS HAD ALREADY LEFT 
FOR WORK OBVIOUSLY HE IS THEN 
RETURNED WHEN HE KNOWS THERE WILL 
BE NO ONE IN THE HOUSE HE HAD THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE AND COLLECT

GONE TO THE CASH TILL AND GOT A 
COUPLE OF HUNDRED OF QUID OUT AND

WHAT WAS HE PLANNING 
WE SPOKE 
INITIALLY TO THE LADY AT THE TICKET 
OFFICE WHO SOLD ANDREW THE TICKET

RETURN TICKET ONLY COST FIFTY PENCE 
MORE WHICH INDICATES HE WASN'T 
INTENDING ON COMING BACK HOME WHY WHY HAS ANDREW TRAVELLED TO LONDON

NGAN IN THAILAND TWELVE WEEKS AGO ONE 
OF HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS CHARLIE 
SIMMONDS IS WITH US NOW WHAT WAS 
HE DOING IN THAILAND HE WAS 
TRAVELLING WASN'T HE 
HE HAD BEEN 
SAYING WITH A FRIEND OF OURS IN 
BANGKOK AND TRAVELLING AROUND HE 
WENT DOWN TO THE SOUTH OF THAILAND 
COY COCOA ON HIS OWN

EXPERIENCED TRAVELLER ISN'T HE HE HE IS AN EXPERIENCED TRAVELLER HE HAS 
BEEN TO SEVERAL CONTINENTS INDIA 
SOUTH AMERICA I'VE TRAVELLED WITH 
HIM MYSELF IN INDONESIA HE KNOWS 
WHAT HE'S DOING 
TELL US A LITTLE 
BIT ABOUT THE PARTY HE WENT TO 
THIS PARTY AS FAR AS YOU KNOW AND 
THEN WHAT HAPPENED 
WE'VE LAST GOT 
HIM TRACED BY MOBILE PHONE CALL TO 
A SPECIFIC BAR THE DAY AFTER THE 
PARTY PARTY THAT CALL WAS MADE AT TWO HUNDRED SEVEN THAT 
WAS FROM OUR FRIEND ROY IN BANGKOK 
WE ALSO HAVE A SIGHTING OF HIM AND 
THAT'S AT MIDDAY BUT WE BELIEVE 
THE TWO HUNDRED PHONE CALL WAS ALSO IN THE 
SAME BAR THEN SOMEBODY CAME BACK 
INTO THE BAR AT FIVE HUNDRED AND DANIEL 
WASN'T THERE SO IN THAT THREE HOUR 
PERIOD WE KNOW THAT'S WHEN HE'S 
GONE MISSING

IS A BAR ON THE ISLAND IS IT IT IT IS IS WHEN HE WAS TRAVELLING THERE HE 
HAS LOTS OF CLOSE FRIENDS I KNOW

WAS HE 
NO THIS HAS BEEN PART OF 
THE PROBLEM TO GET INFORMATION HE 
HAD MET PEOPLE ON THE WAY DOWN TO 
THE ISLAND HE'S' A VERY 
CHARISMATIC FRIENDLY GUY AND MAKES 
FRIENDS EXTREMELY QUICKLY BUT THE 
PEOPLE THAT HE WAS WITH HAD ONLY 
KNOWN HIM FOR MAYBE TEN DAYS TWO 
WEEKS AT MOST 
SO INITIALLY IT WASN'T THAT 
UNUSUAL THAT HE WOULD HAVE GONE 
MISSING BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW 
HIM THAT WELL 
I KNOW YOU'VE DONE A 
MASSIVE INTERNET CAMPAIGN AS WELL 
TO TRY TO GET INFORMATION HOW IS 
THAT GOING WHAT SORT OF 
INFORMATION ARE YOU GETTING IN 
BECAUSE OF THE VERY FACT HE WASN'T 
TRAVELLING WITH LONG STANDING CLOSE 
FRIENDS THE FACEBOOK PAGE THAT WE 
SET UP HAS BEEN CRUCIAL IN GETTING 
THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE GOT 
WE'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE THE LAST 
PERSON THAT SIGHTED DANIEL AS I 
SAY IN THAT BAR AT MIDDAY WE GOT 
THEM FROM FACEBOOK AND IT'S GONE 
OUT TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND LOTS OF 
PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN US REPORTS OF 
DIFFERENT INCIDENTS DIFFERENT 
THINGS THAT MIGHT CORRELATE TO 
DANNY'S SITUATION 
THAT'S WHAT YOU 
REALLY NEED YOU NEED SPECIFICS 
FROM PEOPLE WHO SAW HIM AROUND THAT 
TIME IS THAT WHAT YOU NEED FROM 
PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING TODAY

MEDIUM HEIGHT MEDIUM BUILD 
SPEAKING IN AN ENGLISH ACCENT

SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE BY ELAINE

IN TERMS OF RESEARCHING WITH 
FRIENDS FAMILY RELATIVES ET 
CETERA TO DATE WE CAN FIND NO 
PRECURSOR EVENTS THAT WOULD HAVE
