I'M ON A JOURNEY TO SEE HOW DISASTER AND CALAMITY SHAPES ARCHITECTURE 
IN SYRIA AN ANCIENT CITY RAPED AND PILLAGED 
IN GERMANY AN AERIAL ATTACK 
THAT DESTROYED A BAROQUE MASTERPIECE 
SAN FRANCISCO LIVING IN THE SHADOW OF IMMINENT EARTHQUAKE 
AND IN THE HEART OF AFGHANISTAN 
THE WONDER OF THE WORLD THREATENED BY VIOLENT CONFLICT 
THE CITY OF DRESDEN ON THE RIVER ELBE IN EASTERN GERMANY 
THE CITY OF DRESDEN ON THE RIVER ELBE IN EASTERN GERMANY 
DRESDEN'S KNOWN AS THE FLORENCE ON THE ELBE BECAUSE OF THE 
SPECTACULAR BAROQUE ARCHITECTURE CREATED HERE IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
IT WAS THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF THE CITY AS A COHERENT WORK OF ART 
WITH MONUMENTAL PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND MORE HUMBLE PRIVATE BUILDINGS 
COALESCING TO CREATE A PLACE OF OUTSTANDING BEAUTY 
BEFORE WORLD WAR TWO DRESDEN HAD SURVIVED BOTH BOMBARDMENT AND MODERNISATION 
IT STOOD AS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST INTACT HISTORIC CITIES 
IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN FORTY FIVE DRESDEN WAS BOMBED IN ONE OF THE MOST SAVAGE AERIAL ATTACKS OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE BUILDINGS IN ITS HISTORIC CORE WERE DESTROYED OR DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR 
THE ALLIES' AIM WAS TO UNDERMINE GERMAN MORALE TO HASTEN THE END OF THE WORLD 
TO DO THIS THEY WOULD ATTACK A GREAT GERMAN CITY VIRTUALLY UNTOUCHED BY BOMBING 
SO FROM THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY THE THIRTEENTH TO THE AFTERNOON OF THE FIFTEENTH 
THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TONNES OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES AND FIRE BOMBS WERE DROPPED ON DRESDEN 
AS MANY AS THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE PERISHED 
THE CENTRE OF DRESDEN WAS DEVASTATED 
MIRACULOUSLY DRESDEN'S MOST BEAUTIFUL BUILDING 
THE FRAUENKIRCHE THE PROTESTANT CHURCH OF OUR LADY 
WAS STILL STANDING WHEN THE LAST BOMBERS LEFT 
THE STONE WALLS AND DOME OF THE FRAUENKIRCHE FATALLY WEAKENED BY FIRE HAD SIMPLY COLLAPSED 
DRESDEN'S DESTRUCTION REMAINS CONTROVERSIAL TO THIS DAY 
THE PEOPLE OF DRESDEN THOUGHT THEIR CITY WOULD BE SAFE 
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IT WASN'T PART OF THE GERMAN WAR MACHINE 
BUT THE ALLIES ARGUED IT WAS A CENTRE OF COMMUNICATIONS AND ARMS PRODUCTION 
DRESDEN CERTAINLY WASN'T ENTIRELY INNOCENT 
BUT IT WAS STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND DID ITS BLOODY DESTRUCTION END THE WAR MORE QUICKLY 
DID IT SAVE THE LIVES OF MANY ALLIED SOLDIERS 
OR WAS IT SIMPLY A WAR CRIME TO RANK ALONGSIDE THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE GERMANS AND THE JAPANESE 
THIS IS A QUESTION THAT IS MUCH DEBATED AND WILL NEVER BE FULLY RESOLVED 
BUT WHAT SEEMS CLEAR TO ME IS THAT TOTAL WAR BY ITS VERY DEFINITION IS IMMORAL INHUMANE AND UNETHICAL 
AS THE WAR ENDED IN EUROPE DRESDEN CAME UNDER COMMUNIST CONTROL 
EAST GERMANY BECAME THE G. D. R. THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 
AT FIRST THE COMMUNISTS WERE SENSITIVE TO THE NEED FOR RESTORATION 
BUT BY THE LATE FIFTIES THEY HAD EMBRACED HARDLINE MODERNITY 
THE CENTREPIECE OF THE G. D. R. VISION FOR THE HISTORIC HEART OF DRESDEN IS THIS 
THIS MIGHTY ROAD THAT DIVIDES THE OLD TOWN INTO TWO PARTS 
THIS ROAD IS THREE TIMES THE WIDTH OF THE ROAD THAT WAS HERE BEFORE NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
I SUPPOSE IT'S MEANT TO SYMBOLISE SOCIALIST PROGRESS 
ALONG THIS ROAD WERE GROUPED THE MAJOR NEW BUILDINGS OF 
THE SOCIALIST REGIME INCLUDING THIS THE PEOPLE'S PALACE OF CULTURE COMPLETED IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
WHILE ALL THIS WAS BEING BUILT THE RECREATION OF HISTORIC 
ARISTOCRATIC AND BOURGEOIS DRESDEN WAS OFF THE AGENDA 
SOVIET ANTHEM PLAYS 
BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE IRON CURTAIN FELL 
THE OLD REGIMES OF EASTERN EUROPE WERE SWEPT ASIDE IN A SERIES OF POPULAR REVOLUTIONS 
GERMANY WAS REUNIFIED AND IN THE EUPHORIA THAT FOLLOWED 
THERE WAS A PASSION TO RECREATE THE LOST DREAM OF DRESDEN 
FOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS THE FRAUENKIRCHE HAD BEEN LEFT A PILE OF RUBBLE 
BUT IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO A BOLD DECISION WAS MADE 
THE FRAUENKIRCHE WOULD RISE AGAIN 
IT'S AMAZING 
AGAINST ALL THE ODDS THIS MIGHTY DOMED CHURCH ONCE AGAIN PRESIDES OVER THE CENTRE OF DRESDEN 
AND IT'S MORE THAN SIMPLY AN ARCHEOLOGICALLY CORRECT RECREATION IT'S MORE OF A RADICAL REPAIR 
BECAUSE FORTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE STONES ARE THE ORIGINAL SALVAGED FROM THE SITE 
WHICH EXPLAINS ITS SOMEWHAT MOTTLED APPEARANCE WHICH IS GREAT 
SO THE OUTSIDE IS FINE 
WHAT ABOUT THE INTERIOR 
WILL THAT HAVE POWER WILL IT HAVE SPIRIT 
THIS IS SENSATIONAL 
A BRAND NEW EARLY EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BAROQUE INTERIOR 
WE'RE SEEING THIS AS IT WAS INTENDED TO BE SEEN IN THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTIES 
FULL OF COLOUR LIGHT AND WIT 
THE STONE AND THE TIMBER IS MARBLED PAINTED 
AMAZING THERE'S LOTS OF GILDING 
NOTHING HERE IS QUITE WHAT IT SEEMS VERY THEATRICAL 
IN FRONT OF ME IS THE ALTAR AND THIS IS VERY MOVING INDEED 
AROUND EIGHT PER CENT OF IT IS ORIGINAL 
NEARLY TWO THOUSAND FRAGMENTS FOUND AMONGST THE RUINS USED TO RECONSTRUCT IT A GREAT JIGSAW PUZZLE 
AN AMAZING PIECE OF WORK 
YOU CAN SEE AT THE BACK THERE THE STONE IS DAMAGED FROM THE FIRE THAT RAGED HERE 
BUT MONEY FOR THIS CAME FROM AROUND THE WORLD 
FOR THE ALTAR FOR THE WHOLE CHURCH ALL OF THIS IS AN ACT OF RECONCILIATION 
NOW THE REBUILDING OF THE FRAUENKIRCHE 
HAS STIMULATED THE RECONSTRUCTION OF MUCH OF THE HISTORIC HEART OF DRESDEN 
MORE OF A CHALLENGE THAN THE REPAIR AND REBUILDING OF INDIVIDUAL ARCHITECTURAL GEMS 
IS THE ATTEMPT TO RECREATE THE CENTRE OF DRESDEN AS A WORK OF ART 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE WAR 
COMPLETE STREETS ARE BEING REMADE SO THE GEMS WILL ONCE AGAIN 
BE IN THEIR CORRECT ARCHITECTURAL SETTING FOR EXAMPLE THE BUILDINGS BEHIND ME 
HAVE BEEN COMPLETED THEIR FRONTS BASED ON THE ELEVATIONS OF BUILDINGS THAT STOOD HERE UNTIL NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
OLD BUILDINGS ARE MORE THAN MERELY MASONRY AND MORTAR 
THEY'RE A MEMORY AN IDEA EXPRESS THROUGH THEIR DESIGN 
AND EVEN WHEN THE STONES OF A BUILDING ARE SCATTERED THE IDEA LIVES ON THROUGH 
ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE THROUGH DRAWINGS THROUGH PHOTOGRAPHS AND THAT BUILDING CAN BE REBORN 
THE DESTRUCTION THE SUFFERING OF DRESDEN WAS EXCEPTIONAL 
THEREFORE ITS RECONSTRUCTION MUST BE EXCEPTIONAL 
IF THE CENTRE IS REBUILT WITH GUSTO WITH CONVICTION 
AND THAT COULD MEAN THE REMOVAL OF INAPPROPRIATE MODERN BUILDINGS 
THEN THIS GREAT CITY CENTRE WILL LIVE ONCE AGAIN AND THE RUINS OF THE WAR WILL FINALLY BE HEALED 
I'M DRIVING THROUGH THE SYRIAN DESERT 
IN THE PAST THIS VAST ARID LAND WAS DOMINATED BY ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST CITIES 
FOR NEARLY ONE THOUSAND YEARS THE ONCE GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL TRADING CITY OF PALMYRA THE PRIDE OF THE DESERT 
A JEWEL OF CLASSICAL ARCHITECTURE LAY ABANDONED FORGOTTEN ENGULFED BY THE SAND 
IT WAS A VICTIM OF A CATASTROPHE THAT SHOOK THE ANCIENT WORLD 
A SHOCKING EXAMPLE OF HOW FAR THE HIGH AND MIGHTY COULD FALL 
PALMYRA FLOURISHED AS A COLONY UNDER ROME'S CONTROL FOR NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS 
BUT IN THE THIRD CENTURY AD THE CITY BEGAN TO BREAK FREE FROM ROMAN RULE 
IN ZENOBIA BECAME QUEEN 
SHE'S NOW A CHARACTER SURROUNDED BY MYTH SAID TO HAVE BEEN RUTHLESS 
AMBITIOUS A LOVER OF THE ARTS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT AND OF COURSE VERY BEAUTIFUL 
ZENOBIA'S ROLE MODEL WAS A WARRIOR GODDESS ALAT 
WHO'S WORSHIPPED IN PALMYRA AND INSPIRED THE VERY FORM OF THE CITY 
FEMALE POWER IS BUILT INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF PALMYRA 
THE MAIN STREET THE COLONNADED STREET ISN'T STRAIGHT DOMINATING IMPERIOUS 
AS WOULD BE A ROMAN CITY 
BUT HERE IS CURVED SEDUCTIVE SUBTLE ACCOMMODATING VERY FEMALE IN ITS NATURE 
AND THE MAIN TYPE OF COLUMNS IN PALMYRA ARE CORINTHIAN 
WHICH BY TRADITION REPRESENTED THE FEMALE ASPECTS OF THE CITY 
IT'S ALL TO DO WITH WOMEN POWER 
UNDER ZENOBIA PALMYRA ENJOYED POWER AND PROSPERITY 
A GOLDEN AGE 
THE WEALTH OF PALMYRA WAS BASED ON COMMERCE 
IT DOMINATED ONE OF THE GREAT TRADE ROUTES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD 
SILK FROM CHINA PRECIOUS PURPLE DYE ALL PASSED THROUGH THE CITY 
THIS IS THE MAIN STREET OF PALMYRA THE COLONNADED STREET 
IT WAS A PROCESSIONAL ROUTE BUT ALSO THE MAIN SHOPPING STREET 
BEHIND THE COLUMNS WERE SET INDIVIDUAL SHOPS AND ON THE COLUMNS ARE THESE LITTLE BRACKETS UPON WHICH 
SAT STATUES OF CIVIC NOTABLES OF MEN WHO HAD INVESTED IN PALMYRA 
REALLY THIS STREET IS A MONUMENT TO THE MERCHANTS OF THE CITY 
ON THAT BRACKET STOOD A STATUE OF QUEEN ZENOBIA AND SHE HAD A VERY BOLD VISION FOR PALMYRA 
THE CITY'S WEALTH HAD GIVEN IT POWER AND PRIDE AND SHE WANTED THE CITY TO BE INDEPENDENT OF ROME 
INDEED SHE WANTED PALMYRA TO BECOME MISTRESS OF ITS OWN EMPIRE 
IN ZENOBIA FREED PALMYRA FROM ROME AND 
INVADED EGYPT AND ASIA MINOR BOTH PART OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 
BUT ZENOBIA'S AMBITION WAS SOON CHALLENGED 
THE EMPEROR AURELIAN SENT HIS TROOPS TO RECLAIM HIS CONQUERED TERRITORIES 
ZENOBIA'S ARMY WAS DEFEATED IN ASIA MINOR 
A ROMAN ATTACK ON THE CITY NOW LOOKED INEVITABLE 
THIS MIGHT LOOK LIKE A PILE OF RUBBLE BUT THESE STONES TELL A DESPERATE STORY 
AFTER DEFEAT ZENOBIA RETREATED BACK TO PALMYRA AND HERE IN HASTE SHE FORTIFIED THE CENTRE OF THE CITY 
TO CREATE A BASTION IN A DEFENCE TO WAIT THE FURY SHE'D UNLEASHED 
AND THIS IS PART OF HER DEFENSIVE SYSTEM KNOWN TO THIS DAY AS ZENOBIA'S WALL 
IN AURELIAN'S ARMY SURROUNDED THE CITY 
DURING THE SIEGE THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE GATHERED HERE 
IN THE COURTYARD AROUND THE TEMPLE TO THE GREAT GOD BELL 
THEY'D HAVE PRAYED OFFERED UP ANIMAL SACRIFICES PLEADED FOR DIVINE INTERVENTION 
TO HELP THEM IN THEIR STRUGGLE WITH THE ROMAN LEGIONS JUST OVER THERE OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS 
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE CITIZENS OF PALMYRA STANDING 
RIGHT HERE CROUCHING BY THESE COLUMNS DAY AND NIGHT 
FEAR TREPIDATION WONDERING WHAT ON EARTH THEY'D DONE TAKING ON THE MIGHT OF ROME 
THESE STONES ORIGINALLY WERE PLACED HIGH UP ON THE TEMPLE AND THIS ONE CONTAINS SOME RATHER AMAZING DETAIL 
IT SHOWS HERE THREE VEILED WOMEN REVEALING THAT IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
WOMEN WERE VEILED FOR AT LEAST SIX HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THE COMING OF ISLAM 
OF COURSE THE DECORATION HERE IS STRANGELY PROPHETIC 
THIS STONE WAS CARVED HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE ZENOBIA'S TIME BUT IT SEEMS TO CAPTURE THE MOMENT DURING 
THE SIEGE WHEN SHE MOUNTED ON THE CAMEL HERE'S A CAMEL AND ESCAPED FROM THE CITY SEEKING ASSISTANCE 
BUT AS ZENOBIA FLED EAST SHE WAS CAUGHT BY THE ROMANS CROSSING THE RIVER EUPHRATES 
WITH THE QUEEN CAPTURED THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE FELT THAT 
ALL THEIR PRAYERS THEIR SACRIFICES HAD BEEN IN VAIN 
THE GODS HAD DESERTED THE TEMPLES ABANDONED THE CITY 
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO DO NOW BUT SURRENDER 
THE ULTIMATE FATE OF ZENOBIA IS UNCERTAIN 
IT'S LIKE AURELIAN TOOK HER BACK TO ROME WHERE SHE WAS IMPRISONED IN A VILLA UNTIL HER DEATH 
BUT HER CITY WAS TO HAVE A MORE TRAGIC END 
AFTER JUST A FEW MONTHS OF ROMAN OCCUPATION THE CITIZENS OF PALMYRA ROSE AGAIN 
SO AURELIAN RETURNED TO PALMYRA FULL OF FURY 
HE CRUSHED THE CITY AND LET HIS TROOPS PILLAGE IT 
THEY RAPED THEY STOLE THE TREASURES FROM THE TEMPLES THEY MASSACRED ITS CITIZENS 
THIS WAS THE END OF PALMYRA AS A GREAT CITY 
IT'S SOBERING TO CONTEMPLATE THE DESTRUCTION WROUGHT 
BY TIME 
BY NEGLECT BY THE ELEMENTS 
TO SEE THE AMBITIOUS WORKS OF MAN 
LAID IN THE DUST 
LOOK ON MY WORK SEE MIGHTY AND DESPAIR 
BUT THESE ARE A THOUGH 
MUTE RUINS NOT MUTE STONES 
ONE STANDS HERE IN THE EVENING AS THE SUN GOES DOWN AND 
ONE CAN HEAR ECHOES OF THE PAST 
LOOKING DOWN THIS GREAT STREET OF TRADE ONE CAN IMAGINE THE CARAVANS THE CAMELS THE MERCHANTS 
IT'S ALL STRANGELY ALIVE VERY EVOCATIVE 
MY GOODNESS ONE CAN ALMOST FEEL THEIR PRESENCE 
ON AMERICA'S WEST COAST IS ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES OF THE WORLD 
SAN FRANCISCO IS CELEBRATED FOR THE BEAUTY OF ITS SETTING 
ITS CULTURE 
AND QUALITY OF LIFE 
BUT LURKING BENEATH ITS STREETS IS A PERMANENT THREAT 
SIREN WAILS 
SAN FRANCISCO IS WAITING FOR WHAT EVERYONE HERE CALLS THE BIG ONE 
THERE'S A SIXTY TWO PER CENT CHANCE THAT A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE WILL HIT THIS AREA 
WITHIN THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS WHICH MEANS AN EARTHQUAKE IS 
NEARLY TWICE AS LIKELY TO HAPPEN AS NOT WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE ADULT LIVING DOWN THERE BELOW ME 
INDEED AN EARTHQUAKE COULD HAPPEN RIGHT NOW IN WHICH CASE THOSE BUILDINGS DESIGNED TO 
OFFER SHELTER AND PROTECTION WOULD BE TURNED INTO KILLING MACHINES 
BUT LIVING WITH THE THREAT ISN'T AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS IT MIGHT SEEM 
SO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO PREPARE FOR AN EARTHQUAKE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
OH I'M TOTALLY UNPREPARED 
I'M WORRY BUT NOTHING I CAN DO IT 
I HAVE WATER STOCKPILED 
I HAVE FOOD STOCKPILED 
I HAVE SOME WATER BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT I DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT 
MY HUSBAND I KNOW KEEPS LIKE JUGS OF WATER 
LIKE UNDER HIS DRESSER WHICH KIND OF ANNOYS ME BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A REALLY SMALL APARTMENT 
DENIAL YES YES 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT AMERICANS LARGELY LIVE IN ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS 
BERKELEY UNIVERSITY STADIUM SITS ASTRIDE 
ONE OF THE BAY AREA'S MAJOR FAULTS MARKING THE COLLISION OF THE PACIFIC AND NORTH AMERICAN TECTONIC PLATES 
IT RUNS DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE STADIUM BISECTING IT LIKE A COFFEE BEAN 
SO WHEN I STAND HERE I'M STANDING ASTRIDE ONE OF THE MAJOR CRACKS IN THE EARTH'S CRUST 
THE STADIUM'S STRUCTURE IS FRAGMENTING CAUSED BY THE CONSTANT MOVEMENT OF THE TECTONIC PLATES 
THIS IS KNOWN AS CREEP AND IT'S GRADUALLY PULLING THE STADIUM APART 
AND WITH PRESSURE BUILDING BENEATH THE SURFACE AT SOME POINT CREEP WILL BECOME QUAKE 
AND IT'S ALL HAPPENED BEFORE 
JUST BEFORE DAWN OF THE EIGHTEENTH APRIL NINETEEN OH SIX DISASTER STRUCK 
A MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE MEASURING EIGHTY TWO ON THE RICHTER SCALE 
FOLLOWED BY CATASTROPHIC FIRES 
KILLED OVER THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE AND LEFT A QUARTER OF A MILLION HOMELESS 
AT THE AGE OF ONE HUNDRED FOUR HERB HAMROL IS ONE OF THE LAST SURVIVORS ALIVE TODAY 
ALL I REMEMBER IS 
MY MOTHER CARRYING ME DOWN THE STAIRS 
SHE WAS HOLDING ON TO THE BANISTER WITH HER RIGHT HAND 
AND HOLDING ME IN HER LEFT ARM 
ALL FOUR OF US SLEPT IN A PARK ABOUT THREE OR FOUR BLOCKS AWAY 
SOUTH OF THE MARKET WAS WAS 
EVERYTHING WAS BURNT DOWN AND ER 
THEY ER THEY THOUGHT THEY WAS GOING TO LOSE THE WHOLE CITY FROM WHAT I LATER LEARNED 
AND ER IT'S A MIRACLE 
THERE'S A HYDRANT THAT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD 
THAT THEY CLAIM SAVED THE CITY 
ONE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S GREATEST MONUMENTS CITY HALL WAS A CASUALTY OF THE NINETEEN OH SIX QUAKE 
IT WAS REBUILT IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN 
BUT HOW WILL THE NEW BUILDING ESCAPE A SIMILAR FATE 
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY YOU CAN SEE A CLUE 
CITY HALL NO LONGER RESTS ON THE GROUND 
ERIC ELSESSER IS THE MAN WHO'S MASTERMINDED THIS FEAT 
I'M ABOUT TO TAKE A TOUR OF THE EXTRAORDINARY CAVITY HE'S CREATED BETWEEN THE BUILDING 
AND THE GROUND 
DOWN HERE IS A VAST NETWORK OF SOPHISTICATED SHOCK ABSORBERS OR ISOLATORS 
WELL WHAT EXACTLY DOES IT DO THIS WELL THIS SPACE 
WELL THIS IS THE BIG ISOLATOR SPACE 
WHERE ALL THE ISOLATORS FOR THE BUILDING ARE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY OF THEM 
AND THEY BASICALLY PROTECT THE BUILDING 
SO ERIC HOW DID YOU GET THESE ISOLATORS IN PLACE BASICALLY THE ENTIRE BUILDING WAS JACKED UP 
NOT ALL AT ONE TIME BUT IN PIECES 
BASICALLY ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY JACKS AT THE TIME AND ONE ISOLATOR PER DAY WAS INSTALLED 
SO THEY'RE TAKING THE TOTAL WEIGHT OF THE BUILDING 
SO HOW FAR COULD THE BUILDING MOVE BEFORE CATASTROPHE SEVERAL FEET 
WELL WE FIGURED THAT IT WOULD BE THIRTY INCHES IN EACH DIRECTION SO THAT'S BASICALLY YOU KNOW SIX FEET 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO US IF AN EARTHQUAKE STRUCK RIGHT NOW 
WE'D BE JUST FINE AND THE BUILDING WOULD MOVE A LOT 
IT MIGHT EVEN BUMP YOUR HEAD 
WE WOULD BE KIND OF ALL RIGHT I THINK YOU'D BE IN FOR A GOOD SHOCK BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT 
MORE THAN MOST CITIES SAN FRANCISCO RELIES ON ITS BRIDGES 
BUT IF AN EARTHQUAKE STRIKES THEY ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE 
A NEW BRIDGE IS BEING BUILT ALONGSIDE THE OLD BAY BRIDGE 
BECAUSE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE IN THE BIGGEST QUAKE SINCE NINETEEN OH SIX A SECTION OF THE 
BAY BRIDGE COLLAPSED KILLING ONE PERSON AND CLOSING IT FOR A MONTH 
IT'S THE CITY'S MOST SPECTACULAR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT 
USING THE VERY LATEST IN EARTHQUAKE RESISTANCE EXPERTISE 
I'M ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE WATER 
URGH I HATE THESE PERFORATED WALKWAYS BUT HERE 
YOU GET THE SENSE OF THE MASSIVE SCALE OF THIS CONSTRUCTION 
GOT TO BE CAREFUL HERE 
O. K. 
BUT IT'S ONLY BENEATH THE ROAD SURFACE OF THE BRIDGE THAT YOU SEE HOW IT WOULD SURVIVE AN EARTHQUAKE 
I'M WALKING THROUGH ONE OF THE VAST HOLLOW CONCRETE SECTIONS ON WHICH THE ROADWAY SITS 
THESE ARE SEPARATED BY NARROW CHAMBERS WHICH ACT AS EXPANSION JOINTS 
WITHIN THESE CHAMBERS ARE HUGE SACRIFICIAL STEEL PINS 
DESIGNED TO TAKE THE STRAIN OF AN EARTHQUAKE AND SAVE THE MAIN STRUCTURE FROM COLLAPSE 
O. K. WOW 
AND HERE WE ARE IN THE EXPANSION JOINT 
WHAT HAPPENS IF AN EARTHQUAKE TAKES PLACE RIGHT NOW WHAT WOULD WE EXPERIENCE WHAT WOULD WE SEE 
WE WOULD EXPERIENCE A MOVEMENT OF ABOUT THREE SECOND PENDULUM YEAH 
AND WE WOULD BE SEEING THESE TWO STRUCTURES ALMOST LIKE A COMPRESSOR BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH 
O. K. SO HOW DOES THAT WORK THIS GREAT PIPE 
IT'S EXACTLY LIKE A FUSE AT YOUR HOME 
IT'S MADE SO THAT IF THERE IS A CASE OF OVERLOAD THIS ELEMENT IS BASICALLY GOING TO YIELD 
REGULAR OTHER BRIDGES ARE DESIGNED WHERE DAMAGE COULD OCCUR ANYWHERE ALONG THIS LINE 
THIS BRIDGE THIS IS WHERE YOU CHECK SO THIS GOES RATHER THAN THE MAIN STRUCTURE EXACTLY 
O. K. THAT MEANS THAT ANY OF THESE FUSES HAVE FAILED OR BEEN DEFORMED YOU WOULD REPLACE THEM 
YES WITHIN A FEW DAYS IT SHOULD BE WELL AND UP AND RUNNING 
BUT AWAY FROM THE PRESTIGE PUBLIC PROJECTS THE CITY HAS A MORE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM 
ORDINARY PEOPLE'S HOMES 
OUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE TYPICAL BUILDING STYLE HERE 
IS WE HAVE A GROUND FLOOR THAT'S A GARAGE YEAH 
WE CAN SEE THAT HERE 
AND ABOVE IT THERE'S TYPICALLY SEVERAL FLOORS OF LIVING 
WE CALL THESE BUILDINGS SOFA STOREYS 
THEY'RE FINE AS LONG AS THE LOAD IS VERTICAL JUST THE 
WEIGHT OF THE BUILDING BUT AS SOON AS YOU START SHAKING IT THERE'S NO SHEER RESISTANCE 
IS NOTHING BEING DONE TO MAKE SURE HOUSES LIKE THIS ARE UPGRADED 
CALIFORNIA HAS THE STRICTEST BUILDING CODES FOR SEISMIC 
SAFETY IN THE COUNTRY HOWEVER THEY DON'T APPLY RETROACTIVELY 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO AREAS LIKE THIS 
WE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE 
HOMELESS THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA AND ANYWHERE FROM THREE THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE COULD BE KILLED 
DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF DAY 
DESPITE GREAT HUMAN INGENUITY THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO 
REMAINS TERRIBLY VULNERABLE TO THE MIGHTY FORCES OF NATURE 
THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE HAD TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH THE NEAR CERTAINTY OF DISASTER 
THEY DON'T KNOW THE HOUR THEY DON'T KNOW THE DAY BUT THEY KNOW SOONER OR LATER IT WILL COME 
HERAT AIRPORT IN AFGHANISTAN 
A DANGEROUS COUNTRY TO VISIT 
I'M TRYING TO REACH THE LEGENDARY MINARET OF JAM 
ONE OF THE ARCHITECTURAL WONDERS OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD 
A SPECTACULAR MONUMENT THREATENED BY WARFARE AND NEGLECT 
FOR NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS IS NOW AT GREATER RISK THAN EVER BEFORE 
IN RECENT YEARS FEW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO VISIT THE MINARET 
I CAN'T BE SURE WHAT STATE I'LL FIND IT IN 
MY BEST CHANCE OF GETTING TO THE MINARET IS TO WIN THE TRUST AND PROTECTION OF THE LOCAL POLICE 
I'M GOING TO MEET THE HERAT CHIEF OF POLICE 
TWENTY TWENTY YEAH TWENTY RIGHT 
AN ESCORT OF TWENTY POLICEMEN IS FAR MORE THAN I EXPECTED 
BUT JUST BEFORE I ARRIVED A GROUP OF KOREANS WAS KIDNAPPED 
BY THE TALEBAN NEAR GHAZNI AND TWO OF THE PARTY EXECUTED 
THE AUTHORITIES ARE SO NERVOUS ABOUT MY TRIP I'VE GOT TO SEE 
THE MOST SENIOR POLICEMAN IN WESTERN AFGHANISTAN 
WE WERE THINKING WE'D BE ADVISED BUT TO TRY AND GET THERE BEFORE 
DARK SO I IMAGINE WE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY TOMORROW MORNING 
SO WE HAVE A GREEN LIGHT TO TRAVEL BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN 
WE'RE ON THE WAY BACK TO OUR HOTEL WHEN HANIF OUR INTERPRETER 
GETS AN UNEXPECTED PHONE CALL 
NOW A SUDDEN CALL FROM THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
A CHANGE OF PLAN A DRAMATIC CHANGE OF PLAN 
WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE NOW WITH THEM HE IS SAYING BELIEVE ME BELIEVE ME 
TIGHT TIGHT SECURITY PICK HIM UP 
PRIME OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO GRASP IT WITH US TO GO 
HE WILL GIVE US ACCOMMODATION TONIGHT 
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE JAM TONIGHT 
THERE ARE FOUR LEAVING 
WE WILL FIND YOU SUITABLE ROOMS 
IS IT REALLY A DEBATE FOR US TO HAVE 
WE ARE BEING TOLD WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO YOU HAVE COME HERE TO COME TO THE MINARET THAT'S INDEED RIGHT 
IF THAT'S THE PLAN PLEASE COME THIS IS THE GOOD TIME FOR YOU 
O. K. THEY ARE OUR SECURITY WE RELY ON THEM FOR PROTECTION ADVICE 
IF THEY'RE SAYING THIS IS THE BEST WAY THEN WE HAVE TO DO IT 
YES THIS IS UNEXPECTED FOR US NOW 
YES GOOD DECEPTION FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IT'D BE SAFE 
YOU ARE TRAVELLING WITH SUCH BIG BOSSES LIKE CHIEF OF POLICE 
WELL EXCEPT WE BECOME A BIGGER TARGET 
NO NO BECAUSE YOU SEE THIS AREA IS NOT EXCEPT THE ROBBERS 
YES BANDITS AND THERE IS NO TALEBAN ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA 
YES YES YES SO THIS IS FROM MY POINT OF VIEW SAFER I LOVE IT IT'S AMAZING 
NO NO NO NO DANGER AT ALL BUT 
YEAH WE NEED THESE GUYS JUST IN CASE 
HERE THEY COME WELL THE POSITION NOW IS VERY INTERESTING 
JUST OVER AN HOUR AGO WE GOT THE CALL WE HAVE TO GO TO JAM TONIGHT 
THE ER THE CHIEF OF POLICE WE MET EARLIER IS HIMSELF GOING AND THIS I THINK IS OUR CONVOY COMING UP 
QUITE HEAVY WEAPONS I NOTICED SOME ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND WE'RE ON THE ROAD TO JAM INCREDIBLE 
WE HEAD OUT INTO THE DESERT WITH A CONVOY OF TWELVE POLICE VEHICLES 
JAM IS TWO HUNDRED MILES AWAY FROM HERAT IN AFGHANISTAN'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS 
ON THESE TRACKS IT'S A JOURNEY OF UP TO FOURTEEN HOURS 
WE CAN'T GET TO JAM TODAY 
BUT IT'S VITAL WE REACH OUR ACCOMMODATION BEFORE NIGHTFALL 
TRAVEL AFTER DARK IS DANGEROUS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE RISK 
OF ROAD ACCIDENTS BUT ALSO THAT'S WHEN THE BANDITS COME OUT 
WE'VE COME UP TO THE MIGHTY HARIRUD RIVER OVER THERE 
THIS RIVER PASSES THE MINARET SO I'LL BE SEEING IT AGAIN LATER ON 
AND OVER THERE THERE ARE SOME TENTS 
THEY LOOK VERY ELEMENTAL VERY SIMPLE 
PEOPLE LIVING IN SUCH A HARSH LANDSCAPE 
AFTER TWO HOURS DRIVING THERE'S A PROBLEM AND OUR CONVOY IS FORCED TO STOP 
IT'S STARTING TO GET DARK AND THE POLICE ARE NERVOUS 
SO THEY POST GUARDS ON HIGH GROUND WHILE THE TYRE IS CHANGED 
BY THE TIME WE'VE MESSED ABOUT WITH FUEL AND AIR 
YEAH YEAH WE ACTUALLY LEFT AT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND WE GOT TO THAT VILLAGE MARWA IN SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES WHICH WAS 
NOT BAD WHICH WAS PRETTY GOOD THAT'S SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES 
THAT'S AN HOUR 
THEN IT'S ANOTHER HOUR AND A HALF TO OUR DESTINATION TONIGHT IT WILL BE DARK THAT'S DAYLIGHT 
IT'S GOING TO BE DARK NOW ISN'T IT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SLOW DOWN AT NIGHT RIGHT 
SO MAYBE ANOTHER TWO AND A HALF HOURS FROM HERE IN DAYLIGHT AND 
MAYBE ADD ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR FOR NIGHT TIME DRIVING O. K. IT'S NOT A PERFECT WORLD IS IT 
BUT THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING NOT A BAD PLAN SO FAR 
NO SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NEARLY AN HOUR IN THE DARK AREN'T WE WHICH IS NOT GOOD 
MINIMUM I THINK YEAH 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SLOW DOWN BECAUSE OF THE HOLES AND EVERYTHING OUT O. K. YEAH RIGHT HI 
VERY GOOD GOOD MAN AND WITH A ROCKET A GRENADE LAUNCHER YEAH 
YEAH IT'S A FORTY MILLIMETRE GRENADE LAUNCHER 
O. K. THANK YOU 
THE TYRE'S DONE BACK ON THE ROAD BACK IN THE CARS AND GET TO OUR DESTINATION NOT TOO LONG AFTER DARK 
DRIVING THROUGH THE DARK IT'S A RELIEF TO ARRIVE AT THE VILLAGE WHERE WE'RE TO SPEND THE NIGHT 
WE'RE NOW NEARLY HALF WAY TO JAM 
SO UM FIVE HOUR JOURNEY FROM HERAT NOT BAD 
HELLO HELLO 
SALAAM SALAAM HOW ARE YOU 
VERY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SUCH A SPLENDID ESCORT AND SO MANY PEOPLE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU 
THE VILLAGE CHIEF INVITES US TO DINNER 
WE'RE IN THE MAIN BUILDING IN THIS VILLAGE THE NAME OF WHICH I HAVEN'T FOUND OUT WHERE ARE WE 
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LITTLE VILLAGE WHERE I AM 
CHESTI SHARIF 
CHESTI SHARIF 
THIS WILL BE THE MAIN ROOM OF THE HOUSE THE MAIN HOUSE AND HAVING A SPLENDID BANQUET 
WE'VE HAD SOME VEGETABLES AND RICE AND THIS IS SPLENDID CHICKEN 
M. M. M. MY GOD VERY TASTY 
VERY GOOD THEY'VE MADE STRONG TASTES VERY STRONG TASTES MY GOSH YOU TRY SOME 
WE GOT UP AT FIVE O'CLOCK MEANT TO BE ON THE ROAD TO JAM BY SIX BUT IT'S ERM 
QUARTER TO SEVEN AND WE'RE STILL HERE 
THE TROUBLE IS THE TYRE OVER THERE 
GOT DAMAGED ON THE ROAD HERE AND WE CAN'T WE CAN'T SEEM TO MEND IT 
THE POLICE ARE GETTING VERY EDGY THIS VILLAGE 
IS REGARDED AS RATHER MEDIUM RISK BUT THAT'S RELATIVELY HIGH FOR THEM 
THE PEOPLE HERE ARE NOT PARTICULARLY HAPPY 
THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF OUR PARTY IS GETTING VERY FRACTIOUS 
HE'S OVER THERE MARCHING AROUND BEING VERY ANGRY 
IT'S NOT GOOD IT'S NOT GOOD 
THE MORE GRUMPY HE GETS THE LESS TIME WE'LL HAVE AT JAM I FEAR 
WELL WE'RE BACK ON THE ROAD NOW AND MAKING GOOD PROGRESS 
THE ATMOSPHERE'S INTERESTING THE POLICE ARE VERY ANXIOUS THEY'RE RUSHING ON AHEAD 
IT'S QUITE HARD FOR US TO KEEP UP WITH THEM 
A LITTLE BIT ABSURD REALLY THEY'RE UP THERE MAKING CLOUDS OF DUST 
WE'VE REACHED THE BORDER OF THE PROVINCE OF HERAT 
AND GHOR GHOR IS WHERE THE MINARET IS IN THE PROVINCE OF GHOR 
AND ADDITIONAL POLICE HAVE TURNED UP TO MEET US AT THE BORDER OVER THERE 
THEY'RE GOING TO ESCORT US FROM HERE TO THE MINARET 
URGENCY IS THE THING AND THEY'RE CALLING US FORWARD WE MUST GET ON 
THE LANDSCAPE CHANGES DRAMATICALLY EVERY FEW HOURS 
BUT WE'RE ALWAYS NEAR THE WATERS OF THE HARIRUD 
THE TRACK BECOMES NARROW 
THREADING THROUGH STEEP GORGES 
I KNOW WE'RE CLOSE BUT AFTER SUCH A LONG JOURNEY WHAT AM I GOING TO FIND 
MY GOD AND THERE IT IS 
CRIKEY IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT THIS IMAGE OF 
DELICATE PERFECTION 
IT REMINDS ONE WHAT A GREAT COUNTRY WHAT A GREAT EMPIRE THERE WAS HERE ONCE 
THIS BUILDING IS NOT ONLY ONE OF THE MOST MAGICAL MYSTERIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS IN THE WORLD 
IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE MOST ARCHITECTURALLY AND HISTORICALLY IMPORTANT 
IT'S ONE OF THE TALLEST AND EARLIEST OF THE GREAT MINARETS 
INDEED IT'S THE ONLY EARLY MINARET THAT HASN'T BEEN OVER REPAIRED OVER RESTORED IT'S AUTHENTIC 
FANTASTIC ALSO IT'S THE LAST SIGNIFICANT ARCHITECTURAL REMINDER 
SURVIVOR OF A ONCE GREAT AND MIGHTY EMPIRE 
THE MINARET BUILT IN THE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETIES AND STANDING SIXTY METRES HIGH IS A 
MEMORIAL TO THE GHURID EMPIRE WHICH STRETCHED ACROSS MODERN AFGHANISTAN PAKISTAN AND NORTH INDIA 
SOME BELIEVE THE MINARET MARKS THE SITE OF THE GHURID SUMMER CAPITAL THE LEGENDARY FIRUZKUH 
OOH THE MOUNTAINSIDES ARE POCKMARKED WITH ROBBER HOLES 
THAT IS ILLEGAL EXCAVATIONS CARRIED OUT BY LOOTERS 
THEY'RE ALL AROUND ME TWO OR THREE IN FRONT OF ME HERE 
NOW THIS ONE THIS ONE IS GOOD LORD 
LOOK AT THIS ONE THEY'VE MEANT TO HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY PEOPLE 
DURING THE TALEBAN TIMES ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO BUT I FEAR THESE ARE MORE RECENT THAN THAT 
AND UM HERE WE SEE INCREDIBLE EVIDENCE REVEALED BY THIS DESPERATE LOOTER 
LOOK THERE'S A GREAT ARCH THERE A MASSIVE BUILDING ON THIS MOUNTAINSIDE 
GOOD EVIDENCE OF BEING THE LOST CITY OF THE GHURIDS 
A GREAT STRUCTURE HERE COVERED I SUPPOSE THROUGH MUD THAT'S 
FALLEN DURING VARIOUS LANDSLIDES DURING THE CENTURIES AND BURIED THE FOUNDATIONS 
AND WHAT'S MORE LOOK THE LOOTER HAS DISCARDED AN ARTEFACT 
SO THAT'S THROWN AWAY ONE WONDERS WHAT ON EARTH WAS FOUND AND CARRIED OFF 
STRANGE THING AND MANMADE CLEARLY BIT OF A POT 
IS IT CLAY IT IS 
A BIT OF ARCHITECTURAL DECORATION 
WELL I'LL PUT IT BACK WHERE IT BELONGS BUT I SAY 
A SAD AND TRAGIC BUSINESS 
THE LOOTERS DID THIS MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY'RE POOR AND POOR ARE FORCED TO 
PILLAGE THEIR OWN CULTURE TO LIVE TO FIND OBJECTS TO SELL TO THE WESTERN ART MARKET ULTIMATELY 
WE ARE DESTROYING OUR OWN HISTORY BECAUSE THE OBJECTS REMOVED FROM HERE ARE MOVED FROM THEIR CONTEXT 
ARE ROBBED OF MEANING AND THEY MAKE IT VERY HARD TO 
UNTANGLE THE COMPLEX BEING IN THIS LOCATION CERTAINLY 
IT'S A TRAGEDY TAKING PLACE BEFORE OUR EYES AND WE 
SEEM TO BE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
THE LOOTERS HAVE ROBBED THE VALLEY OF MUCH OF ITS ARCHAEOLOGY BUT THE MESSAGE ON THE MINARET REMAINS 
A LOWER PORTION IS COVERED WITH TEXT ORGANISED AS A SURFACE ORNAMENT 
AND THE TEXT IS ENTIRE NINETEENTH SURA OR CHAPTER OF THE KORAN 
IT'S A CHAPTER ENTITLED MARYAM 
AND IT TELLS THE STORY OF MARYAM JESUS CHRIST AND THE PROPHETS 
VENERATED BY BOTH MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIANS 
SO THIS TEXT HERE THIS MINARET IS PREACHING TOLERANCE IT'S PREACHING 
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THESE TWO RELIGIONS THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT 
IT'S ABOUT MAKING A POINT THAT THEY SHOULD LIVE TOGETHER IN HARMONY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON 
WONDERFUL NOW THE ENTRANCE TO THIS MINARET IS 
BELOW MY FEET BURIED BY CENTURIES OF MUD WASHED HERE BY THE RIVER 
THERE'S A LITTLE DOOR A LITTLE HOLE KNOCKED UP THERE THAT'S THE WAY IN 
LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET UP RATHER RAMSHACKLE LADDER I HOPE I FIT 
UM MOST SHAMING IF I DON'T 
O. K. WELL FIRST THING UP THE LADDER 
SO FAR SO GOOD 
O. K. HERE WE ARE 
GOSH IT IS A TIGHT FIT VERY TIGHT FIT 
BUT UM I AM NOW AT LAST INSIDE THE MIGHTY MINARET OF JAM 
INCREDIBLE 
HERE WE SEE THE STAIRCASE 
AMAZING BEAUTIFULLY DETAILED BEAUTIFUL BRICKWORK 
WELL FIRST OF ALL WE'LL GO DOWN DOWN TO SEE WHAT'S TO BE DISCOVERED 
THE STAIRS ARE MADE OF BRICK THEY'RE DAMAGED RATHER TREACHEROUS BE CAREFUL HERE 
AND NOW THE STAIRS IN FACT STOP OOH 
PEOPLE WILL NOT EXCAVATE BELOW HERE WITH GOOD REASON 
IF THEY EXCAVATE THIS EARTH 
THEN IT WEAKENS THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE BUILDING WHICH ARE ALREADY PRETTY PRECARIOUS 
SO NO WORK HAS BEEN DONE 
WHAT'S BELOW MY FEET FOR 
THE MOMENT REMAINS A MYSTERY 
PHEW SOME CLIMB WHOOPS 
I'VE REACHED THE LEVEL OF THE FIRST PLATFORM SO JUST OVER HALFWAY UP THE 
MINARET AND HERE THE STAIRS GET VERY PERILOUS INDEED 
WELL THIS IS FASCINATING BECAUSE IN FACT I OBSERVE THAT THERE ARE 
TWO SPIRAL STAIRCASES COMING UP ONE WRAPPED INSIDE THE OTHER 
A DOUBLE HELIX THIS ONE I'VE COME UP ANOTHER ONE GOING DOWN HERE 
INCREDIBLE VERY COMPLEX 
VERY STRONG I SUPPOSE 
AND HERE A SHALLOW VAULT BEEN BEAUTIFULLY BUILT 
MINARETS ARE OF COURSE PRACTICAL THINGS 
THEY ARE PLATFORMS FROM WHICH THE FAITHFUL ARE CALLED TO PRAYER 
THEY OF COURSE ALSO FINGERS TO HEAVEN THEY 
RAISE HUMANITY UP TOWARDS THE GODS AND THEY DECLARE A SITE SACRED 
SADLY THE STRUCTURE IS TOO PRECARIOUS TO CONTINUE TO THE TOP 
MODERN WARFARE HAS ISOLATED THIS WONDER OF THE WORLD AND ITS FUTURE HANGS BY A THREAD 
THE AFGHAN POLICE HAVE GIVEN US SOME VERY GOOD PROTECTION FOR WHICH WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL 
NOW A PROBLEM'S EMERGED THEY'RE INSISTING WE LEAVE IMMEDIATELY FOR REASONS OF SECURITY 
TO WRONG FOOT THE ENEMY WHO MIGHT BE WAITING ON THE ROAD BACK 
WE HAVEN'T FINISHED FILMING HERE IT'S INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING BUT WE'VE GOT TO GO 
FOR ME THE MINARET STANDS WITH THE VULNERABILITY 
OF HISTORIC SITES AROUND THE WORLD THREATENED BY CONFLICT AND LOOTING 
IN THIS CONSERVATION CONSCIOUS AGE WE ASSUME OUR MOST PRECIOUS BUILDINGS ARE SAFE 
YET IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY MANY FACE NEW DANGERS AND IMMINENT DISASTER
