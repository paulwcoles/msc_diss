IT BEGAN LIFE ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
IT WAS BUILT BY THIS CHAP A MONK CALLED GUNDULF 
AND IN THESE PARTS THEY SAY IT'S THE SECOND OLDEST IN ENGLAND 
WHERE ARE WE WELL WE'RE IN KENT AT THE ANCIENT CATHEDRAL OF ROCHESTER 
WE MEET THE YOUNGSTERS TREADING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ANCIENT MONKS 
THE WOMAN WHO FOUND FAITH AFTER THE SEVEN SEVENTHS LONDON BOMBS 
AND MUSIC FROM STUART TOWNEND AND THE ROCHESTER CATHEDRAL CHOIR 
ROCHESTER CATHEDRAL BEGAN LIFE AS A MONASTIC COMMUNITY 
OVER ITS LONG HISTORY THE CATHEDRAL BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHTY THREE 
HAS EVOLVED FROM ITS NORMAN FOUNDATIONS INTO A VICTORIAN MASTERPIECE 
THE BUILDING AND ITS TREASURE TROVE OF HISTORIC ART AND ARCHITECTURE 
HAS BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO GENERATIONS OF WORSHIPPERS 
THE STORY OF THIS ANCIENT CATHEDRAL IS CONSTANTLY UNFOLDING 
WITH THESE GREAT WALLS STEEPED IN DAILY PRAYER AND WORSHIP 
OVER THE YEARS THEY'VE RESOUNDED WITH MUSIC TOO AS THEY DO NOW WITH VOICES RAISED IN PRAISE 
THEY SAY ANCIENT CHURCH BUILDINGS ARE A BIT LIKE STORY BOOKS 
READ THE ARCHITECTURE AND YOU CAN TELL THE HISTORY 
WAITING INSIDE FOR ME IS THE MAN WHO'S GOT A HOST OF TALES TO TELL ABOUT THIS PLACE 
HELLO GOOD TO SEE YOU YOU TOO 
BOB RATCLIFFE IS A ROCHESTER CATHEDRAL GUIDE 
WHO ARE THE STATUES THEY'RE FROM THE HISTORY OF THE CATHEDRAL 
THOSE FIGURES FROM JUSTUS WHO FOUNDED THE ORIGINAL CATHEDRAL 
THROUGH TO GUNDULF OUR GREAT BUILDER BISHOP WHO DIED IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHT 
NINE HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND THOSE MAGNIFICENT ORGAN PIPES ABOVE 
THAT'S GILBERT SCOTT GEORGE GILBERT SCOTT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ARCHITECT 
HE DID A LOT OF WORK HERE AND HE REDESIGNED OUR ORGAN 
AND IT FILLS THIS PLACE WITH MUSIC VERY WELL INDEED 
THIS IS ODD WHAT'S GOING ON HERE 
THIS IS OUR TEMPORARY BUTTRESS IT'S ONLY BEEN HERE FOR ABOUT SIX HUNDRED YEARS 
WHY DOES THIS BIT LOOK DIFFERENT IT WAS VERY MUCH A RUSH JOB 
TO MAKE SURE THE THING DIDN'T FALL DOWN IN THE FOURTEEN HUNDREDS 
SO THEY PUT IT IN TEMPORARILY YES INDEED AND SIX HUNDRED YEARS LATER 
NOW HERE WE HAVE ONE OF OUR GEMS OH A DOOR BEHIND A DOOR 
A VERY OLD DOOR PERHAPS ONE OF THE OLDEST DOORS IN A CHURCH IN ENGLAND 
DATING FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY 
ANOTHER BIT OF MEDIEVAL MAKING DO A BIT OF RECYCLING 
SO IS THIS JUST A BUILDING TO YOU BRICKS AND MORTAR THAT FASCINATE YOU NO IT'S FAR MORE THAN THAT 
IT'S MY SPIRITUAL HOME ALL IMPORTANT STAGES OF MY LIFE I'VE HAD A CONTACT HERE 
FROM CONFIRMATION THROUGH WEDDINGS BAPTISMS FUNERALS 
AND THROUGH A NUMBER OF YEARS INDEED SIXTY ODD YEARS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED HERE AT ROCHESTER CATHEDRAL 
TODAY YOU ARE VISITING A VERY VERY VERY OLD CHURCH 
EVERY YEAR SEVENTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN VISIT ROCHESTER CATHEDRAL 
AND GET A TASTE OF ITS HISTORY FROM HELEN BRADSHAW 
CHILDREN COME INTO THE CATHEDRAL THINKING CHURCH THIS IS GONNA BE BORING 
BUT THEY GO OUT REALISING THAT THIS IS A VERY RELEVANT PLACE 
HELEN PUTS THE YOUNGSTERS THROUGH THEIR PACES AS NOVICE BENEDICTINE MONKS 
IF A MONK BROKE A RULE HE WOULD NEED TO BE PUNISHED 
I WONDER IF WE HAVE A BRAVE NOVICE HERE WILLING TO TAKE PUNISHMENT 
WHEN YOU PUT A MONK'S ROBE ON AND PUT THE HOOD UP IT'S A VERY SPECIAL FEELING 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE MONK'S HABIT UM I THINK IT'S REALLY COOL 
I'D LOVE TO DRESS UP IN THIS EVERY DAY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THEIR FASHION SENSE IT'S TERRIBLE 
PUT YOUR HAND UP IF YOU CAN HONESTLY SAY YOU NEVER EVER EVER GET CROSS WITH YOUR FRIENDS OR YOUR FAMILY 
I LIKE TO TRY AND COMMUNICATE THAT THE BENEDICTINE WAY OF LIFE HAS A RELEVANCE TODAY 
THE RULE BOOK WAS WRITTEN BY SAINT BENEDICT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO TO GIVE GUIDELINES ON COMMUNITY LIFE 
BASED ON THE BIBLE AND THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS 
BEFORE THE MONKS COULD ENTER THE COMMUNITY PROPERLY THEY HAD TO MAKE SOME SPECIAL PROMISES 
THOSE PROMISES WERE MADE TO EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY AND TO GOD AND THEY WERE CALLED VOWS 
AND OF COURSE THESE VOWS MUST BE COMMITTED TO MEMORY 
OBEDIENCE CHASTITY AND 
OBEDIENCE CHASTISITY AND I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST ONE 
POVERTY CHASTITY AND 
DIFFICULT TO BE OBEDIENT ISN'T IT 
DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE ANCIENT MONKS AND THEIR SPIRITUALITY HAVE MADE AN IMPACT ON YOU 
IT'S MADE AN ENORMOUS IMPACT ON ME THE BENEDICTINE LIFE 
IS A LIFE OF RHYTHM AND IT'S FRAMED BY PRAYER AND BY SILENCE 
THE GARDEN IS THE PERFECT PLACE FOR THAT 
IT'S THE RUINS OF THE OLD MONASTERY YOU ARE ENCLOSED 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE BEING HUGGED BY GOD YOU'RE PROTECTED ON ALL SIDES IN THIS WONDERFUL ENVIRONMENT OF PRAYER 
THIS IS A BUILDING WHICH IS SOAKED IN PRAYER ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FOUR YEARS OF A CHURCH ON THIS SITE 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PRAYERS A PLACE WHERE GOD HAS BEEN WORSHIPPED DAILY 
THROUGHOUT THAT TIME IT HAS AN AMAZING SENSE OF PEACE IT'S AN ABSOLUTE GIFT REALLY 
THROUGHOUT THAT TIME IT HAS AN AMAZING SENSE OF PEACE IT'S AN ABSOLUTE GIFT REALLY 
BUT THE HEART OF ITS LIFE AND THE VERY REASON IT STANDS HERE IS WORSHIP 
MORNING ALL MORNING 
ALL MANNER OF PEOPLE COME IN HERE AND ALL MANNER OF PEOPLE COME IN 
WHILE WORSHIP IS GOING ON IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE ORTHODOX WORSHOP 
THEY'LL JUST WANDER IN AND WALK AROUND A BIT PEOPLE FEEL AT HOME 
MISERERE BY ALLEGRI 
THE FIRST THING THAT STRUCK ME WHEN I WALKED INTO THIS BUILDING 
IT WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO FEEL INFORMAL TO WELCOME YOU IN AND YET STILL LARGE ENOUGH 
TO HAVE THAT WOW FACTOR OF SOMETHING SPECIAL 
THE BREADTH AND THE LENGTH OF THE BUILDING GIVES YOU A SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE ON YOUR OWN LIFE 
A LOT OF THE RESEARCH ABOUT CHURCH GROWTH 
HAS SHOWN THAT PEOPLE TAKE A VERY LONG SLOW JOURNEY TOWARDS GOD 
AND THE CHURCH HAS TO ALLOW THEM SPACE TO DO THAT CATHEDRALS GIVE YOU THAT SPACE 
DO THIS AS OFTEN AS YOU DRINK IT IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME 
I FEEL A GREAT SENSE OF PRIVILEGE 
AT BEING GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD WORSHIP IN A PLACE LIKE THIS 
THERE IS A TANGIBLE SENSE THAT SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL IS HAPPENING 
AND IN THOSE SPECIAL MOMENTS 
YOU GET A REAL SENSE OF BEING CONNECTED NOT JUST TO GOD BUT TO YOUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS 
ALONGSIDE THE CLERGY IS THE ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS HELPING WITH EVERY ASPECT OF THE WORSHIP 
I THINK WELCOMERS ARE VERY IMPORTANT WE ARE THE FRONT LINE TROOPS OR FRONT OF HOUSE 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT FAITH THEY ARE OR IF THEY HAVE NO FAITH AT ALL 
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE WELCOME 
YOU HAVE TO ENSURE THINGS RUN SMOOTHLY WITH AS LITTLE FUSS AND DISTURBANCE AS POSSIBLE 
IT'S SERVICE SERVICE TO THE CHURCH SERVICE TO THE CATHEDRAL 
AND TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE 
I LOVE READING TO STAND THERE AND READ THE WORD OF GOD TO EVERYONE 
TO GIVE THAT POWERFUL MESSAGE IS SUCH A PRIVILEGE 
I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PUT OVER THAT WORD 
IN THE BEST WAY I POSSIBLY CAN 
IT'S JUST A WONDERFUL SPIRIT HERE 
ONE FEELS THAT THE BUILDING HAS HAD PRAYERS SAID IN IT FOR ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED YEARS 
AND IT'S AS THOUGH THE VERY STONES HAVE ABSORBED SOMETHING 
AND YOU JUST FEEL IT WHEN YOU WALK INTO THIS WONDERFUL PLACE 
COME SEE THIS GLORIOUS LIGHT 
AS IT SHINES ON YOU 
BRINGING GRACE AND PEACE 
TO THE DEPTHS OF YOUR SOUL 
COME SEE THESE WOUNDS OF LOVE 
SCARS THAT MAKE YOU WHOLE 
BLOOD THAT PAID THE PRICE 
FOR THE SINS OF THE WORLD 
HE IS THE LIGHT EVERLASTING 
HE IS THE FIRST AND THE LAST 
BLESSING AND HONOUR AND GLORY AND POWER 
BLESSING AND HONOUR AND GLORY AND POWER 
BLESSING AND HONOUR AND GLORY AND POWER TO YOU LORD 
YOU'RE THE KING OF THE AGES 
JUSTICE AND TRUTH ARE THE MARKS OF YOUR REIGN

THEY'RE CRYING HOLY AGAIN AND AGAIN 
LORD JESUS YOU'RE THE KING OF THE AGES 
COME ALL YOU THIRSTY AND POOR

AND BE SATISFIED

LIFT YOUR VOICE AND PRAISE 
YOUR ETERNAL REWARD 
HE'S THE DESIRE OF THE NATIONS 
HE IS THE FAITHFUL AND TRUE 
BLESSING AND HONOUR AND GLORY AND POWER

LORD JESUS YOU'RE THE KING OF THE AGES 
THERESA HARRISON HAS WORKED IN THE ROCHESTER DIOCESAN OFFICE NEXT DOOR TO THE CATHEDRAL FOR FIFTEEN YEARS 
I NEVER USED TO COME INTO THE CATHEDRAL MUCH I USED TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED AND WALK PAST IT EVERY DAY 
I WASN'T A PRACTISING CHRISTIAN THEN 
BUT ALL THAT CHANGED ON THE SEVENTH OF JULY TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
IT WAS STILL RUSH HOUR IN LONDON WHEN THE ATTACKS BEGAN 
THE BLASTS HAPPENED WITHIN ONE HOUR 
A WELL REHEARSED EMERGENCY PLAN SWUNG INTO OPERATION 
THERESA'S DAUGHTER SUSAN WAS A LONDON COMMUTER 
AND WAS TRAPPED ON ONE OF THE TUBE TRAINS 
TO BEGIN WITH I DIDN'T THINK SUSAN WAS ANYWHERE NEAR WHERE IT HAPPENED 
THEN AS THE DAY WENT ON AND WE HADN'T HEARD FROM SUSAN I WAS CONCERNED OBVIOUSLY 
SCOTLAND YARD HAS ISSUED A SPECIAL TELEPHONE NUMBER FOR ANYONE CONCERNED ABOUT FRIENDS OR 
IT WASN'T UNTIL I LEFT WORK THAT I STARTED TO THINK THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO SUSAN 
I CAN REMEMBER THINKING 
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO PEOPLE LIKE US IT HAPPENS TO OTHER PEOPLE 
AND THEN WHEN WE HEARD AT ONE THOUSAND FIFTEEN THAT EVENING THAT SUSAN HAD LOST HER LEG 
I SUDDENLY REALISED THAT IT DID HAPPEN TO PEOPLE LIKE US AND IT WAS HAPPENING 
PEOPLE SAIDE GOD'S LOOKING AFTER YOU AND I'D SAY DON'T BE SILLY 
BECAUSE AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED GOD WAS NOWHERE NEAR ME 
I STILL COULDN'T THINK THAT A CARING GOD WOULD PUT ANYBODY THROUGH WHAT WE WERE GOING THROUGH 
I WAS OVERWHELMED BY PEOPLE SENDING ME CARDS AND LETTERS 
PEOPLE FROM THE CATHEDRAL SOME THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW 
GIVING ME MESSAGES SAYING THAT GOD WAS LOOKING AFTER ME 
SUSAN SAID TO ME MUM I THINK YOU NEED TO GO TO THAT CHURCH THOSE PEOPLE ARE SUCH LOVELY PEOPLE 
I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU NEED TO BE 
I NOW COME INTO THE CATHEDRAL QUITE REGULARLY AND LIGHT A CANDLE 
IT'S A VERY QUIET PEACEFUL PLACE 
I WILL PRAY FOR THOSE THAT LOST THEIR LIVES AND I WILL ALWAYS THANK GOD 
FOR GIVING US SUSAN 
BUT I ALSO THINK I'M VERY EMPATHETIC TOWARDS OTHER PEOPLE'S SUFFERING NOW 
WHEN ANYTHING HAPPENS ANYWHERE I ALWAYS THINK OF THE FAMILIES OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH 
BEFORE I NEVER KNEW WHAT ANGUISH THEY USED TO GO THROUGH BUT I DO NOW 
CAN YOU EVER REALLY GET OVER SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
I DON'T THINK WE'LL EVER COME TO TERMS WITH IT IT WILL ALWAYS BE SOMETHING THAT LIVES WITH US 
BUT WE HAVE TO PUT IT BEHIND US 
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT IT HAPPENED TO US FOR A REASON AND ONE OF THOSE 
IS THE FACT THAT IT BROUGHT ME BACK TO FAITH 
I MADE THAT COMMITMENT AND I THINK IT WILL BE THERE FOREVER NOW 
HOLY GOD GIVE US A GLIMPSE OF HEAVEN THROUGH OUR WORSHIP ON EARTH 
LOVING FATHER HELP US TO FEEL YOUR PRESENCE WHEREVER WE ARE 
JESUS MASTER AND FRIEND TEACH US TO FOLLOW YOUS WAYS 
HOLY SPIRIT GUIDE US TO OUR TRUE HOME 
AND MAY GOD WHO IS FATHER SON AND HOLY SPIRIT BLESS YOU 
AS YOU TOUCH THE EARTH GENTLY AND JOURNEY IN PEACE AMEN 
PEOPLE MIGHT BE DRAWN TO THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF THE ARCHITECTURE OR THE HISTORY OR THE CHORAL TRADITION 
BUT WHAT THEY SOON DISCOVER IS THAT A CATHEDRAL IS WORTH SO MUCH MORE THAN THE SUM OF ITS INDIVIDUAL PARTS 
AND THAT RIGHT AT ITS HEART IS A COMMUNITY OF ORDINARY PEOPLE 
INSPIRED WITH EXTRAORDINARY FAITH 
IN A GOD TO WHOM GLORY HAS BEEN GIVEN IN THIS PLACE BY COUNTLESS GENERATIONS 
SO FROM ROCHESTER CATHEDRAL AND FROM ME GOODBYE 
NEXT WEEK SALLY MAGNUSSON TAKES A WALK DOWN EDINBURGH'S HISTORIC ROYAL MILE

AND DISCOVERS HOW GREYFRIARS BOBBY CONTINUES TO INSPIRE 
YOU'VE BEEN THE ONE TO BEAT 
THERE IS NO COMPETITION 
NO ONE'S GONNA MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME 
DING DING ROUND TWO
