GOOD AFTERNOON IT IS A BRIGHT 
BREEZY DAY IN SHEFFIELD MOMENTUM 
IS BUILDING AT THE CRUCIBLE THE 
SEMI FINALS ARE UNDER WAY WE WILL 
CHART THE PROGRESS OF BOTH MATCHES 
THIS AFTERNOON FOR TWO OF THE FOUR 
PLAYERS HENDRY AND O'SULLIVAN THE 
LATTER STAGES OF THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP IS FAMILIAR FOR ALI 
CARTER AND JOE PERRY IT IS A 
DIFFERENT STORY 
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TWO OF THE 
ALL TIME GREATS PLAYING IN ONE HALF 
HENDRY AND O'SULLIVAN AND THE FACT 
THAT WE HAVE CUT AND PERRY IN THE 
BOTTOM HALF THEY WERE NOT THE 
FAVOURITES TO COME THROUGH THEY 
THOUGHT MAGUIRE WOULD BE IN THE 
SEMI FINAL CARTER AND PERRY YOU 
WOULD VIRTUALLY HAVE HAD THE FOUR 
TOP PLAYERS IN THE WORLD PLAYING IN 
THE SEMI FINALS 
I THINK WHEN JOE JOHNSON WON THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP IT MADE 
EVERYBODY REALISE YOU HAD THE 
CHANCE TO WIN IT YOURSELF JOE WAS 
SOMEBODY I PLAYED MANY TIMES AND I 
HAD A GREAT RECORD AGAINST HIM YOU 
HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL AT 
THE CRUCIBLE JOE JOHNSON HAD AN 
EXCELLENT TEMPERAMENT 
THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN 
AT THE HARDEST TOURNAMENT FOR 
OUTSIDERS TO WIN BUT OVER THE LAST 
FEW YEARS IT HAS BEEN A SURPRISE 
WHEN THEY HAVE NOT BEEN A SURPRISE 
WE HAD SHAUN MURPHY IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE GRAEME 
DOTT IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IF GRAEME DOTT CAN 
WIN THE WORLD TITLE JOE PERRY OR 
ALI CARTER ARE DEFINITELY GOOD 
JOHN PARROTT WINS THE EMBASSY WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP EIGHTEEN TO ELEVEN 
ALL THAT 
SOMEBODY HAS TO DO HERE IS HAVE THE 
MATCH OF THEIR LIFE THE SESSION OF 
THEIR LIFE JOHN PARROTT AGAINST 
JIMMY WHITE IN THE FINAL NOBODY 
HAS EVER PLAYED BETTER THAN WHAT 
JOHN PARROTT DID IN THAT FIRST 
SESSION 
THERE ARE TWO REASONS WHY THEY ARE 
MORE SURPRISES AT THE CRUCIBLE THAN 
IN PREVIOUS YEARS FIRSTLY THERE 
ARE LESS TOURNAMENTS NOWADAYS SO 
THE TOP PLAYERS HAVE LESS OF AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO GATHER MOMENTUM 
CONFIDENCE FORM ALSO THE 
STRENGTH IN DEPTH OF SNOOKER IS 
MUCH DEEPER MAYBE NOT DOWN AS FAR 
AS YOU MIGHT THINK BUT CERTAINLY 
THERE IS A HARD CORE OF TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY 
PLAYERS WHO ARE EXCELLENT 
WHO KNOWS IF THEY PLAY AT THEIR 
BEST THEY HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
WINNING THEY HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF 
UNDERDOGS WINNING BEFORE SO WHY 
NOT JOE PERRY OR ALI CARTER 
O'SULLIVAN A TREMENDOUS PLAYER 
HENDRY NOBODY HAS BEEN BETTER AT 
THE CRUCIBLE L. WOULD BE VERY 
SURPRISED IF NEITHER OF THOSE WON 
THE TROPHY 
ONCE YOUR TIME IT IS LIKE YOU KNOW 
AND NOBODY ELSE KNOWS OF COURSE 
THE GREATNESS COMES IN YOU KNOW 
THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW 
I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE ASSUMING 
THAT CARTER OR PERRY CANNOT WIN 
THEY THINK IT WILL BE HENDRY OR 
O'SULLIVAN 
THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE O'SULLIVAN HE WAS TO SAY WINNING THAT MATCH 
THEY MIGHT NOT PLAY EACH OTHER OUT 
CARTER OR PERRY ONE OF THEM COULD 
BE INSPIRED 
INTERESTING WORDS FROM 
CLIFF THORBURN YOU ARE THE MOST 
IMPORTANT ONE TO BELIEVE IF ONE OF 
THOSE BELIEVES THEY CAN WIN IT 
THEY ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON 
IN THE ROOM 
AND THEY ARE MATCH FIT 
THEY HAVE PROBABLY PLAYED TWO HUNDRED 
FRAMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE 
CARTER AND PERRY IS OUR MAIN COURSE 
ON THE MENU THIS AFTERNOON 
IT IS EVERYBODY'S DREAM TO WATCH 
HENDRY AND O'SULLIVAN FOUR TO FOUR AFTER 
THE FIRST SESSION 
I WILL BE 
COMMENTATING ON THE ALI CARTER 
AGAINST JOE PERRY SEMI FINAL FOR 
BOTH OF THEM IT IS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT MATCH OF THEIR CAREER

COMMENTATORS WE GET VIEWS OF A NEW 
INITIATIVE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE 
MORE AND MORE CHILDREN INTO SNOOKER

THE MASTERMIND 
COMPETITION FINISHES THE FINAL 
CONTEST AND WHEN MISSING 
CAN WE 
HAVE OUR NEXT CONTENDER PLEASED A A NOT HERE DENNIS IS NOT HERE 
PROBABLY SWOTTING UP 
AND WE GO 
BACK IN TIME TO FEATURE A SNOOKER 
HERO THAT REACHED THE SNOOKER 
CRUCIBLE SEMI FINAL AT OVER SIXTY 
YEARS OF AGE FRED DAVIS 
FRED DAVIS WAS ACTUALLY SIXTY FOUR WHEN HE 
REACHED THE SEMI FINALS OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP ACTION NOW FROM 
TWO THIRTYSOMETHINGS THE SEMI 
FINAL BETWEEN STEPHEN HENDRY THIRTY NINE 
AND RONNIE O'SULLIVAN JUST THIRTY TWO 
IT WAS THE MOST EAGERLY ANTICIPATED 
MATCH OF THE TOURNAMENT THE FIRST 
SESSION DID NOT DISAPPOINT STEPHEN 
MADE A BOLD STATEMENT OF INTENT 
WITH A DAZZLING ONE HUNDRED FORTY BREAK IN THE 
OPENING FRAME 
THE SECOND WAS MUCH TIGHTER RONNIE 
IMPRESSED WITH SOME MAGICAL ESCAPE 
TRICKS 
BUT IT WAS STEPHEN WHO PINCHED THE 
FRAME TO LEAD TWO TO ZERO 
STEPHEN ALSO TOOK THE THIRD BUT IN 
THE FOURTH RONNIE FOUGHT BACK TO 
TRAIL THREE TO ONE AT THE INTERVAL AFTER 
THE BREAK STEPHEN EXTENDED HIS 
LEAD AGAIN RONNIE LEFT THE DOOR 
OPEN ON THE GREEN STEVE AND 
GRATEFULLY ACCEPTED THE GIFT 
STEPHEN GREAT FULLY ACCEPTED THE 
GIFT RONNIE WAS FACING THE 
PROSPECT OF A TERRIBLE FIRST 
SESSION BUT HE RALLIED WITH A 
SLICK CENTURY TO TAKE THE SIXTH 
HE ALSO WON THE SEVENTH AND THE FINAL 
FRAME OF THE AFTERNOON WAS 
UNDERSTANDABLY A TENSE AFFAIR 
IT WAS RONNIE WHO HELD HIS NERVE TO 
COMPLETE HIS COMEBACK AND LEAVE THE 
MATCH POISED AT FOUR TO FOUR 
INTO THE SECOND SESSION WE GO IT 
IS RONNIE TO PLAY SEVEN POINTS UP 
IN FRAME NINE COMMENTARY BY JOHN 
VIRGO AND WILLIE THORNE 
RONNIE DESPERATELY SEEING IF THE 
YELLOW HAS COME TO HIS RESCUE BUT 
I DON'T THINK IT HAS LOOKING AT 
HIS FACE NO STEPHEN CAN GET 
THROUGH TO THIS RED NEAR THE CORNER 
POCKET 
BY BECAUSE IT WAS A RELATIVELY EASY 
POT STEPHEN DID NOT RISK PLAYING 
IT WITH CHECK SIDE TO GO BACK INTO 
BAULK 
IT IS A BIT OF A SHOCK WHEN BAULK YOU MISS A SHOT LIKE THAT BECAUSE 
YOU KNOW YOU WILL KISS THE REDS HE 
HAS NOT LEFT ANYTHING EASY THOUGH 
HE HAS DONE WELL TO GET THE CUE 
BALL THROUGH THAT BUNCH 
AS YOU SAY WILLIE STEPHEN DID NOT 
LEAVE ANYTHING EASY BUT MONIQUE 
DID NOT MAKE IT LOOK TOO DIFFICULT 
DID HE RONNIE THE FIRST GOOD 
CHANCE OF THE MORNING 
STRAIGHT AWAY ON THE LAST SHOT THE 
RED WAS NOT REALLY IN THE WAY BUT 
HE KNEW BY MOVING IT THE PINK 
WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN TO AT LEAST 
THREE POCKETS 
RONNIE AND STEPHEN ARE ALWAYS 
LOOKING TO WIN THE FRAME AT ONE 
VISIT L. L. WISH OTHER PLAYERS WOULD 
LOOK AT THAT SITUATION EVERY NOW 
AND AGAIN BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY 
NEED A FEW CHANCES THESE GUYS DO 
NOT 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN THE MATCH 
AND RONNIE HAS BEEN IN FRONT 
ALBEIT ONLY ON POINTS IN THIS FRAME 
AND THE ONE NEXT TO THE BLACK IS 
ONLY HIS PROBLEM BALL IN TERMS OF 
WINNING THE FRAME IN ONE VISIT IT 
MUST BE EXTREMELY TIGHT RONNIE IS 
NOT PLAYING FOR THAT ONE NOW BUT HE 
IS LOOKING THREE OR FOUR SHOTS IN 
ADVANCE AT THE MOMENT 
HE KNOWS THAT IS THE ONLY BALL THAT 
COULD POSSIBLY STOP HIM WINNING THE 
FRAME IN THIS VISIT IT IS VERY 
TIGHT L. DON'T THINK IT POTS IN THE 
RIGHT AND JAW YOU ONLY WANT TO 
PLAY THAT SHOT IF YOU GET RIGHT 
BEHIND IT RIGHT HAND TO DRAW 
WITH THE PINK IN THE OPEN I DON'T 
KNOW WHY HE IS TOO CONCERNED ABOUT 
THAT RED HE CAN GET PAST THE 
WINNING LINE IN THIS FRAME WITH THE 
OTHER RED IN OPEN PLAY AND REDS 
A NICE CONFIDENT START POTS GOING 
INTO THE HEART OF THE POCKET 
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A LITTLE BIT 
OF WORK TO DO HERE L. DON'T THINK 
THE THREE RATES ABOVE THE BLACK ARE 
IN POLE POSITION THREE REDS HE 
IS HAVING ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS RED 
HE REALLY WANTS TO PLAY ON IT 
HE MADE SURE HE WAS NOT TOUCHING 
THE GROUND WE KNOW IT IS TIGHT HE 
IS TAKING A CHANCE TOUCHING THE 
BRABOURNE 
IF IT GOES HE WILL POTTER IT 
BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BE BETTER 
SITUATED HE WILL POT IT 
HE HAS LOOKED AT IT FOUR TIMES AND 
STILL NOT HAPPY WITH IT 
HE HAS AN 
ALTERNATIVE TO THE RIGHT OF THE 
BLACK IT IS POINTLESS TAKING ANY RISKS 
THAT IS THE FIRST SHOT HE HAS 
OVERHIT 
HE HAD TO PLAY THE SCREW AROUND TWO 
CUSHIONS WITH SIDE HE PLAYED IT 
PERFECTLY SAYING THAT THE WHITE 
HAS BOMB ON A BIT SPUN ON 
IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS ON THE BLACK 
THAT RED WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
HE CAN PLAY A LITTLE SCREW SHOT AND 
BRING THAT INTO PLAY HE DID NOT 
FEEL AS THOUGH HE NEEDED TO NOW 
YOU SEE THE REASON WHY SIXTY THREE AHEAD 
JUST A RED AND THE COLOUR NEEDED 
A COLOUR IT SHOWS YOU AT THIS 
LEVEL YOU MAKE ONE MISTAKE 
WHEN RONNIE PLAYED HIS SAFETY SHOTS 
YOU THOUGHT STEPHEN WOULD GET THE 
FIRST CHANCE THIS WAS IT HE JUST 
MISSED IT HE HAS BEEN SAT DOWN 
EVER SINCE THAT BLACK IS THE FRAME 
AT THE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN THE 
QUESTION ONLY WILL IT BE A 
CENTURY THE JUST A FRACTION STRONG 
JUST WANTED TO GO PAST THAT RED 
DOES IT GO INTO THE MIDDLE HE WILL 
TAKE IT HE DID NOT PLAY FOR IT IN 
THERE NOW THE AWKWARD LAST RED 
TRIED TO DEVELOP IT OFF THE PINK I 
DON'T THINK THERE IS A DOUBLE ON SO 
THIS COULD BE END OF BREAK JUST 
SEVEN POINTS SHORT OF A CENTURY 
SIX DOUBLES FOUR TROUBLES AND AN 
ACCUMULATOR THAT WAS A GOOD START 
FOR RONNIE TREBLES RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN PUNISHED HENDRY BY 
WINNING THE FRAME WITH A 
BREAK OF 
NINETY THREE HE TAKES THE LEAD FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN THE MATCH 
WE GO TO FRAME 
TEN STEPHEN HAS A 
DECENT LEAD FORTY EIGHT 
TEN STEPHEN HAS A DECENT LEAD FORTY EIGHT POINTS THE A RED AND A COLOUR NEEDED 
NO HE WAS ON THE BLUE SO YOU COULD 
SAY HE HAS MISSED FRAME BALL 
JUST ON THE TOP DRAWER NEVER 
REALLY THREATENING THE POCKET 
JAW 
THE RED DOWN THE CUSHION IS JAW NOT ONE YOU LIKE TO PLAY BUT IT 
WILL BE SUCH A BODY BLOW IF HE 
ROLLS THIS IN 
HE WILL PROBABLY PLAY THE FLICK 
INTO THE PINK TO BRING BOTH THOSE 
REDS INTO PLAY 
HE KNOWS THIS IS A CHANCE TO HURT 
STEPHEN HENDRY HE HAS JUST LOST 
THE CUE BALL A LITTLE BIT SO A 
LITTLE BIT OF WORK TO DO THIS IS 
NOT A ONE HUNDRED OUT OF ONE HUNDRED SHOT THIS ONE 
HE HAS TO CUE DOWN ON ITS LIGHTLY 
ON IT SLIGHTLY HE PLAYED THAT 
VERY WELL HE CAN PLAY FOR THE RED 
ON THE CUSHION NOW AND THAT WOULD 
MAKE THINGS VERY EASY 
BY HE HAD A QUICK GLANCE TO SEE 
WHETHER THE BLUE WOULD POT INTO THE 
MIDDLE THAT WOULD BE THE EASIEST 
BALL TO GET INTO THE RED HE KNOWS 
HE DOES NOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING 
WITH THE CUE BALL THIS WOULD BE A 
BODY BLOW FOR STEPHEN JOHN 
YES YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR CHANCES 
AT THIS LEVEL PARTICULARLY AGAINST 
A PLAYER OF RONNIE O'SULLIVAN'S 
CALIBRE HE HAS HAD TWO CHANCES AND 
COULD NOT CONVERT THEM 
THERE ARE PEOPLE HAVE TO SIT THERE 
AND SUFFER AS RONNIE NEEDS THIS 
PEAK THIS PINK AND SIX REMAINING 
COLOURS TO TAKE THE SECOND FRAME OF 
THIS SESSION 
THIS WAS THE ONE HE WOULD MISS 
THAT TWICE OUT OF FIFTY A BAD MISS 
THIS MIGHT BE SHORT THIS MIGHT BE 
SHORT HE JUST GOT THERE 
JUST LOST THE CUE BALL A BIT OVER 
THE LAST THREE SHOTS HE DID NOT 
RISK PLAYING THAT WITH CHECK SIDE 
LIKE SOME PLAYERS WOULD HE DECIDED 
TO LEAVE THE MORE DIFFICULT BROWN 
HE HAS JUST LOST THE CUE BALL FOR A 
SECOND OR TWO IT SHOWS THE 
PRESSURE 
STEPHEN YOU WILL GET A FAIR CHANCE 
REMARKABLE L. THINK HE HAS LEFT IT 
RONNIE IS GOING BACK TO HIS SEAT 
WITH HIS HEAD BOWED HE HAS NOT HE 
HAS NEEDED HIM HE HAS SNOOKERED HIM 
IT IS A BIG SWERVE EASY HIT OFF 
THE SIDE CUSHION L. THINK HE CAN 
SWERVE THIS 
THE SLOWER YOU PLAY 
THE SWERVE THE MORE CHANCE YOU 
HAVE OF GETTING THIS WORK IF YOU 
PLAY IT WITH PACE IT COULD PUSH 
AWAY FIRST 
IT WAS COMING WASN'T 
IT HE HAD LOST THE CUE BALL HE 
WAS NOT GOOD ON THE GREEN OR BROWN 
IT TRIPPED HIM UP ON THE BLUE 
I AM SURPRISED AT THIS CHOICE I I CAN'T BELIEVE HE IS GOING THIS WAY 
ODDS AGAINST O. K. RONNIE WAS LUCKY 
NOT TO LEAVE IT L. WOULD RATHER 
HAVE PLAYED THIS WORK THAN TRY TO 
POTTED THAT WAY THE THAT SWERVED 
RONNIE CANNOT HOLD FOR THE PINK SO 
HE HAS TO GO IN AND OUT OF BAULK 
ALL HE HAS TRIED TO HOLD THIS IS 
DANGEROUS HE DID THAT BEAUTIFULLY 
YOU PROBABLY NOTICED HOW LOW HE WAS 
CUEING HE TOOK THE PACE OUT OF THE 
CUE BALL 
HE JUST DIDN'T THE CUE BALL OFF THE 
CUSHION HE RAN THREE OR FOUR 
INCHES TOO MUCH HE STILL NEEDS THE 
PINK AND BLACK BY 
THIS WOULD BE A SEVERE BODY BLOW I 
KNOW IT IS EARLY IN THE MATCH BUT 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAD TWO CHANCES IN 
THE FIRST FRAME AND THREE CHANCES 
IN THIS FRAME 
WELL HENDRY MADE FIFTY THREE HE HAD A 
COUPLE OF CHANCES AND MISSED THEM 
BOTH RONNIE O'SULLIVAN GOES 
FURTHER CLAIRE PLAYER ON TO 
FRAME ELEVEN AND STEPHEN IS TWENTY TWO BEHIND 
FURTHER CLEAR 
HAS HE GOT THE SNOOKER IT IS NOT 
HITTING THE BALL CAN YOU GET IT 
SAFE RONNIE OBVIOUSLY CAN GET AN 
AGE OF THIS RED AN AGE 
HE PLAYED IT ABSOLUTELY DELIGHT 
FULLY ADVANTAGE O'SULLIVAN 
FOUL AND A MISS RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN FOUR 
RONNIE ASKING FOR THE BALL TO BE 
REPLACED WHICH I SUPPOSE IS THE 
NATURAL THING TO DO BUT THERE IS A 
CHANCE THAT STEPHEN CAN GET THIS 
SAFE 
DOES IT SLOWDOWN DOES IT GO OVER 
THE POCKET OVER THE POCKET EASY 
HIT BUT COULD HE GET IT SAVED NO 
SAFE 
YES AS JOHN MENTIONED IT WAS NOT 
SAFE AND THAT IS WHY HE PLAYED IT 
WITH PACE STEPHEN IS A LITTLE BIT 
UNLUCKY TO PUSH IT OVER THE CORNER 
THE COLOURS ARE ON THEIR SPOTS YOU 
WOULD NOT THINK STEPHEN HENDRY 
WOULD GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME 
BACK TO THE TABLE ON THIS FRAME 
THE THIRD FRAME OF THIS MORNING 
GOES BY WE WILL GO IT WILL GO TO 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN STEPHEN HAS HAD 
HIS CHANCES JUST A COUPLE OF 
POSITIONAL SHOTS REALLY HAVE COST 
HIM THE LAST TWO FRAMES IN 
PARTICULAR WHEN HE HAS HAD GOOD 
OPPORTUNITIES HE KNOWS HE CANNOT 
AFFORD TO MISS THOSE BEGINS THIS 
MAN AGAINST THIS MAN ONE MORE 
FRAME BEFORE THE MIDSESSION 
INTERVAL STEPHEN WOULD LOVE TO GET 
SOMETHING OUT OF THIS SESSION 
BECAUSE HE HAS HAD NOTHING SO FAR 
SOMETHING OUT OF THIS SESSION BECAUSE HE HAS HAD NOTHING SO FAR 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN EXTENDS HIS LEAD SEVEN TO FOUR BECAME EIGHTY FOUR EIGHT TO FOUR 
HE COULD NOT GET INTO THE MAIN 
BUNCH HE HAS GOT THE FULL BALL 
CONTACT 
GOING INTO THE BUNCH IS NOT 
ADVANTAGEOUS 
COULD HE PLAYED THE CANNON ON TO 
THE BEDS PLAY THE CANNON ONTO 
THE REDS THAT IS WHAT HE IS DOING 
HE HAS HAD TO JUDGE THE PACE 
IN NEXT SHOT IS THE KEY SHOT HE 
NEEDS TO OPEN THE REDS HE IS 
COMING DOWN TO LOOK AT THE VALUE OF 
PLAYING THE 
PINK I 
THINK THAT IS 
THE BEST BADDIE HE COULD 
PUSH THE 
RED OVER THE RIGHT HAND CORNER 
VALUE 
THE ONE ON THE EXTREME LEFT OF THE 
BUNCH WILL BE PUSHED TO THE LEFT 
IT HAS NOT WORKED HE MAY HAVE THE 
TOP ONE HE HAS NOT GOT THE ANGLE 
HE WANTED HE HAD TO PUT A BIT OF BACKSPIN SO 
THE CUE BALL 
DID NOT STICK ON 
THE RED 
NOT FAR FROM BUT WINNING LINE IN 
ANOTHER FRAME THE WINNING LINE STEPHEN HENDRY LED FOUR TO ONE 
HE JUST HAD ENOUGH ANGLE ON THE BED 
HE IS SLOTTING THEM IN AS THOUGH 
THEY ARE OVER THE POCKET RED 
THAT WAS MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUSLY 
EASY 
THIS IS THE FIRST OF THE FRAMES 
THIS MORNING STEPHEN HENDRY HAS 
NOT REALLY HAD 
A CHANCE IN THIS 
FRAME 
THAT IS A TOTAL OF EIGHT ON THE 
TROT 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN BROKE OFF 
STEPHEN COULD NOT SEE A SAFETY 
NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE WHEN 
THE 
OTHER MAN 
IS AT 
THE TABLE 
POTTING BALLS YOU CAN ONLY WATCH 
THIS IS THE ONE THAT STEPHEN COULD 
NOT SEE A SAFETY 
HE KNEW IT WAS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER 
AND HIS WORST FEARS HAVE BEEN 
REALISED THIS HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY TOP DRAWER 
ALL CENTURIES ARE GOOD BUT THIS ONE 
HAS BEEN VERY GOOD THERE YOU GO 
THAT IS HIS EIGHTH CENTURY OF THE 
TOURNAMENT 
IT IS THE FIFTY FOURTH OF THE TOURNAMENT 
THE RECORD STANDS AT SIX T. EIGHT IN THE 
TOURNAMENT SIXTY EIGHT I THINK SIXTY WILL BE BEATEN 
THIS HAS BEEN A MASTER CLASS END 
BREAK BUILDING POETRY IN MOTION 
NOTHING THAT ANYBODY COULD DO 
STEPHEN MADE A MISTAKE RONNIE 
CLEARED UP IN MAGIC MOMENT WILL 
STEP HE NOW LEADS NINETY FOUR A MAGIC 
IN THE NEXT ONE IT IS RONNIE AT 
THE TABLE AND NO SCORE 
THESE MATCHES CAN DRIFT AWAY FROM 
YOU HE HAD CHANCES IN THE THREE 
FRAMES 
WE HAVE BEEN ENJOYING THE PLATE OF 
RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN BUT 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN BUT STEPHEN HENDRY WILL NOT 
BE LOOKING 
AT IT 
THAT WAY PLAY 
I AM NOT CERTAIN WHERE HIS NEXT 
FRAME COMES FROM 
HE DOES NOT HAVE THE PERFECT ANGLE 
TO GET ON THE 
BLACK HE 
WILL BE 
LOOKING AT THE ANGLE NEXT TIME HE 
WOULD LOVE 
TO GO 
INTO THE 
REDS BY 
THE BLACK SPOT THIS IS PERFECT 
THERE IT IS HE NEVER MISSES A 
TRICK YOU COULD SEE THE WHITE 
GOING INTO THE PACK IT WENT IN 
TWICE IT WENT HINT AT SPEED IN 
RONNIE ALWAYS MAKES THINGS HAPPEN 
HE GETS THROUGH THE BALL BETTER 
THAN MOST 
HE JUST DOES EVERYTHING SO QUICKLY 
WHEN HE IS BREAK BUILDING 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NINE ON THE TROT 
IF HE CAN WIN THE FRAME 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS NEVER LOST NINE ON 
THE TROT BEFORE THIS WILL BE THE 
FIRST TIME NOT PERFECT ON THE BLUE 
HE COULD RUN BY THE PACK ON TWO 
CUSHIONS L. WAS NOT SURE IF THAT 
SHOT WAS ON THAT SHOT COULD BE A 
FRAME WINNER IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY 
PLAYED 
THE APPLAUSE TELLS YOU THAT THE 
FRAME IS OVER 
STEPHEN HENDRY DOES NOT SEEM TO 
PLAY WELL IN SECOND SESSIONS 
AGAINST RONNIE 
THIS IS NINE ON THE TROT WHICH IS A 
RECORD 
HE MADE A BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE IN THE LAST 
FRAME IT WAS POETRY IN MOTION 
THIS HAS BEEN SLIGHTLY BETTER HE IS CUEING LIKE A DREAM 
WE ARE TALKING OF SIX OR SEVEN 
FRAMES ON THE 
TROT THAT 
HAVE BEEN 
PLAYED IN SUCH A WAVE AN WAY SUCH A WAY 
IF YOU LET THIS MAN LOSE YOU CAN 
SEE WHAT HE CAN DO 
AND 
TWO OF THE GREATEST PLAYERS OF ALL 
TIME ONE OF THEM IS TOTALLY 
COMMANDING THIS SESSION A POSSIBLE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
IT WILL ECLIPSE BEAT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE OF THE 
PREVIOUS FRAME THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE 
TWO TOTAL CLEARANCE IS ON THE TROT 
CLEARANCE IS IT DOES NOT GET ANY 
BETTER THAN THAT O'SULLIVAN IS IN 
UNSTOPPABLE FORM HE IS WINNING BY 
TEN FRAMES TO FOUR RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HAS WON NINE SUCCESSIVE 
FRAMES STEPHEN IS EIGHT POINTS UP 
IN FRAME 
FIFTEEN WHAT CAN HE DO 
DO NOT MISSED THE RED MISSED 
MISS HE OVER CUT IT 
STEPHEN MUST BE THINKING AT THE 
MOMENT HE CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE A 
MISTAKE IT 
IS PUTTING 
PRESSURE ON 
EVERY SHOT HE MAKES 
VERY RARELY DO YOU SEE A LOOK OF 
ASSIGNMENT A PERSON'S FACE OF 
STEPHEN HENDRY'S CLASS ON A 
PERSON 
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE HIGHER 
SUCCESS RATE IS OVER TWENTY FIVE 
HIGHEST I WOULD THINK NINETY TWO PER CENT WOULD 
BE THE HIGHEST EVER 
RONNIE IS 
HAVING A CLOSE LOOK DOES THE RED 
NEAR THE BLACK GOLD IN THE CORNER 
IT MUST BE TIGHT GO HE COULD 
GET THE ONE TO THE RIGHT OF THE 
BLACK 
THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN THE RED AND 
THE BLACK 
LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES STEPHEN STEPHEN HAD CHANCES IN THE OPENING THREE 
FRAMES AND HE HAS HAD CHANCES IN 
THIS ONE 
WE ARE 
TALKING FOUR 
CHANCES IN SIX FRAMES THAT IS HOW 
GOOD O'SULLIVAN HAS PLAYED THIS 
MORNING 
ALL THE OTHER OPTIONS WERE 
DIFFICULT HE KNEW HE WOULD BE 
LEAVING THE BLUE 
THE RED ON THE PINK SPOT POPS 
POP'S POTS 
HE HAD TO GET BACK FOR THE BLUE 
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF 
HOW SMOOTH 
HE 
GETS TO THE BALL IT WAS INCH PERFECT ON THE BLUE 
HE IS IN FULL STRIDE HE HAS OPENED THE REDS BUT IT HAS 
GONE SLIGHTLY WRONG THEY HAVE NOT 
BROKEN AS HE HOPED HE 
HAS GOT 
RED 
TO THE 
LEFT MIDDLE BUT IT IS 
TRICKY IT LOOKED TRICKY 
LOVELY POT LOVELY CONTROL OF THE 
CUE BALL L. KNOW SOME PEOPLE 
CRITICISE ASKED FOR EULOGISING SO 
MUCH ABOUT RONNIE WE HAVE DONE THE 
SAME 
ABOUT STEPHEN 
HENDRY WHEN 
WAS AT 
THE PEAK OF HIS POWERS 
WHEN THEY ARE PLAYING AT THEIR BEST 
YOU HAVE JUST GOT TO BE SO 
IMPRESSED L. MAKE NO APOLOGIES 
THIS MORNING RONNIE HAS BEEN 
MAGNIFICENT STEPHEN WILL BE 
MAGNIFICENT STEPHEN WILL BE WILLING BE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES RUEING 
STEPHEN HAS HAD NO CHANCE AGAINST A 
BARRAGE OF BREAKS 
HE IS NOT OVER THE WINNING LINE IN 
THIS FRAME YET THAT HAS GONE 
ASTRAY IF HE PLAYS THE PINK LEFT 
HANDED COMMENT YOU CAN IMAGINE HIM 
STUNNING OFF ONE CUSHION LEFT 
HANDED YOU CAN IMAGINE 
HE HAS PLAYED ROUND THE BACK OF THE 
RED THAT WAS AS GOOD AS YOU CAN 
HIT IT HE KNOWS THIS IS A BIG BALL 
LEFT HANDED AND RIGHT HANDED JUST 
CHECKING THE SCOREBOARD THE LEAD 
IS FORTY NINE 
HE PLAYED AN EXCELLENT SHOT HE IS 
NOT PERFECT ON THE RED NO HEROICS 
SOMETIMES IT IS HARD TO ADD UP 
RONNIE HAS 
HAD ABOUT 
TEN LOOKS AT 
THE SCORE BOARD WE ARE PAST THE POINT WHERE STEPHEN 
HENDRY WILL 
BOTHER COMING BACK TO 
THE TABLE 
YOU CANNOT PLAY BETTER THAN THIS YOU BUT NOT BET AGAINST A THIRD 
CENTURY IN SUCCESSION WOULD NOT 
BET 
IT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT WAS TOO EASY 
FOR RONNIE SULLIVAN RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN LEADS BY ELEVEN TO FOUR THAT WAS 
A SUPREME BREAK STEPHEN HENDRY HAS 
NEVER BEEN WHITE WASHED IN 
A SECOND 
IN A 
SESSION OF SNOOKER 
AT THE 
CRUCIBLE RONNIE 
IS AT THE 
TABLE 
AND THERE IS NO SCORE CALL THE POLICE HE HAS MISSED ONE THAT WAS A SUPERB OPENING 
STEPHEN JUST STOPPED IN HIS TRACKS 
HAS 
HE WENT TOO FAR IS ON 
THE RED HE PLAYED FOR DO NOT THINK HE 
IS ON 
THE BALL HE PLAYED 
FOR 
STEPHEN HAS PLAYED A FABULOUS RED 
LOOK WHERE HE HAS FINISHED L. THINK HE CAN SCREW IT BACK IT HIT THE JAW 
TO SEE ANYBODY WHITEWASHED IS NOT 
NICE STEPHEN HENDRY HAS BEEN ONE 
OF THE 
GAME'S 
GREATS HE WILL 
HAVE 
TO DIG 
DEEP TO 
GET BACK INTO THIS 
MATCH 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HAS INFLICTED TWO 
WHITEWASHES IN A SESSION BEFORE IT 
WILL NOT BE THE FIRST TIME HE HAS 
WON BOUGHT EIGHT 
AUG EIGHT IT MAY NOT HAPPEN IF 
STEPHEN HENDRY CAN GET A SIZEABLE 
BREAK HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL 
WE MAY SEE HIM GOING UP FOR THE 
BLUE 
JUST NOT HARD ENOUGH THERE IS ONE 
LOOSE RED THAT 
HE CAN 
GET ON BY 
JUST ROLLING THE BLUE IN 
THERE IS PRESSURE ON THIS AT THE 
MOMENT THERE IS PRESSURE ON EVERY 
SHOT HE PLAYS HE KNOWS IF HE MAKES 
ONE MISTAKE IT IS END OF FRAME 
I AM SURPRISED HE DID NOT RISK 
BRINGING OTHER REDS INTO PLAYED HE 
WILL HAVE TO GO INTO THEM NOW L. 
CANNOT SPOT ANY PLANTS IT IS NOT 
THE GREATEST PACK TO GO INTO 
HE HAD NO LUCK I DON'T THINK HE IS 
ON A RED HE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO 
HAVE WON THIS FRAME IN ONE VISIT AS 
RONNIE HAS BEEN DOING BUT HE WILL 
HAVE TO PLAY SAFE 
IT IS A FUNNY OLD GAME YOU CAN 
LOOK AT THIS SESSION AND SAY IT WAS 
AN ABSOLUTE SLAUGHTER HENDRY'S 
FIRST THREE FRAMES HE COULD HAVE 
WON THEM IT YES 
YES ALTHOUGH STEPHEN HENDRY HAS A FORTY FOUR 
POINT LEAD THAT IS A GOOD SAFETY 
SHOT FROM RONNIE THERE IS A LOT OF 
PRESSURE ON THIS ONE AGAIN 
WHEN THINGS ARE NOT GOING RIGHT FOR 
YOU EVERY LITTLE KISS GOES WRONG 
HE HAS GONE INTO THE BUNCH TWICE 
AND GOT ON NOTHING HE HAS PLAYED A 
SAFETY SHOT AND PUSHED IT INTO POTABLE POSITION 
HE WILL PLAY THE KISS ON THE THREE 
REDS TO THE LEFT AND PUSHED THROUGH 
THEM PUSH IF THE RED JUST BELOW 
THE PINK WILL POT HE MIGHT NOT 
PLAY THE KISS BECAUSE HE CANNOT 
GUARANTEE GETTING ONTO RED 
IT REMAINS TO BE SEE WHETHER HE 
PLAYS THE LOOSE ONE THERE IS THE 
MIDDLE RED IS HE ON ONE YOU BET 
HE GOT A HEAVY CONTACT THERE IT 
NEARLY THROUGH THE RED OFF LINE L. 
THINK HE MIGHT HAVE PLAYED IT WITH 
A LITTLE BIT OF RIGHT HAND SIDE AND 
TURNED THE RED OVER IT WENT IN 
STEPHEN WHEN HE WAS AT THE TABLE 
PROBABLY THOUGHT HE WOULD PUT HIS 
FIRST FRAME ON THE SCOREBOARD IT 
IS LOOKING DOUBTFUL NOW THESE REDS 
ARE IN THE OPEN AND RONNIE IS ONLY 
EIGHTEEN POINTS BEHIND HE IS FAVOURITE 
THIS RUN OF BREAKS HE HAS HAD I 
CAN'T REMEMBER HIM PLAYING A KISS 
AND NOT GETTING IT PERFECT I CAN'T 
REMEMBER HIM PLAYING ON A LOOSE RED 
AND NOT GETTING ON IT WHEN HE HAS 
GONE INTO THE BUNCH HE HAS ALWAYS 
LEFT HIMSELF OPTIONS THIS HAS BEEN 
ABOUT AS GOOD AS YOU CAN SEE AND I 
AM SURE THIS CRUCIBLE CROWD REALISE 
THAT THEY ARE WATCHING GENIUS AT 
WORK L. AM SURE MOST PEOPLE IN THE 
AUDITORIUM HAVE PLAYED SNOOKER NOW 
AND AGAIN AND PROBABLY A FEW 
PLAYERS IN HERE THAT HAVE MADE 
HUNDRED BREAK A LOT OF CLUB 
PLAYERS AROUND THE COUNTRY NONE OF 
THEM HAVE MADE THEM LOOK AS EASY AS 
THIS 
I MENTIONED THAT FORTY FOUR POINT LEAD 
WOULD EVAPORATE VERY QUICKLY AFTER 
THIS BLACK IT HAS GONE 
THAT LOOKED TO BE THE ONLY 
DIFFICULT SHOT LEFT LIKE MOST OF 
THEM RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE 
POCKET 
AS WE SAID BEFORE LEFT HANDED 
RIGHT HANDED NO DIFFERENCE THE THE ANGLE ON THE YELLOW TO BE ABLE TO 
GENERATE THE SPEED LEFT HANDED WAS 
VERY VERY GOOD HE KNOW HE HAS WON 
THE SESSION EIGHT TO ZERO THAT IS WHY HE HAS 
OVERHIT THE GREEN 
IT DOES NOT GET ANY BETTER THAN 
THAT BARRING SNOOKERS RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HAS WON ALL EIGHT 
SURELY THAT SESSION HAS SETTLED THE 
OUTCOME OF THIS SEMI FINAL IT IS 
TWELVE TO FOUR TO RUN A THE NEXT SESSION 
STARTS AT SEVEN P. M. TONIGHT TO RUN 
STEPHEN HENDRY WHITEWASHED IN A 
CRITICAL SESSION OF SNOOKER FOR THE 
FIRST TIME TO RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
TO WHAT EXTENT IS THAT RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN WHAT 
HAPPENED IN THAT SESSION GOING GOING BACK ANOTHER SESSION WHEN HENDRY 
WAS FOUR TO ONE IN THE LEAD HE LET RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN OFF THE HOOK HE WILL 
HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT 
HE WILL ALSO HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED 
THAT HE HAD TO ANSWERS IN THE FIRST 
TWO OR THREE FRAMES TO DO BETTER 
HE HAD CHANCES TO FIND HIMSELF TWELVE 
FOUR BEHIND IS BECAUSE OF RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HE IS THE BEST GENIUS 
WE HAVE HAD IN THIS GAME AND 
POSSIBLY EVEN IN SPORT IN GENERAL 
THERE IS TIGER WOODS IN GOLF OR 
ROGER FEDERER IN TENNIS STEPHEN 
HENDRY IN SNOOKER L. L. THINK RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN IS THE BIGGEST GENIUS I 
HAVE EVER SEEN IN SPORT HE IS 
PHENOMENAL ONLY A RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN COULD DO THAT TO SUCH A 
GREAT PLAYER AS STEPHEN HENDRY 
TIGER WOODS AND ROGER FEDERER 
GREAT CHAMPIONS BUT YOU THINK IN 
TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO PLAY HIS 
SPORT RONNIE LEAVES THEM BEHIND 
YES JIMMY WHITE AND ALEX HIGGINS 
AS WELL RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS 
BREATHTAKING IT IS A TOUGH GAME 
AND WHAT HE DOES IS JUST 
ASTONISHING 
WHAT IS AT THE HEART ASTONISHING OF IT THE COMMENTATORS TALKED 
ABOUT CUE BALL CONTROL IS IT 
BECAUSE HE GETS THE BALL EXACTLY 
WHERE HE WANTS IT WHAT IS THE 
SECRET THAT MAKES HIM SUCH A 
GENIUS 
HE HAS GREAT CONTROL OF GENIUS WEIGHT IF YOU PLAYED CROWN GREEN 
BOWLS OR DARTS HE WOULD HAVE 
CIBBER JUDGMENT OF WEIGHT HE IS A 
PINBALL WIZARD HE WOULD HAVE 
GREAT JUDGMENT OF WEIGHT 
FOR ALL 
THIS TALENT HE HAS ONLY WON THE 
WORLD TITLE TWICE HOW DO YOU 
EXPLAIN THIS TO THE PEOPLE AT HOME 
YOU DID IS SIX TIMES STEPHEN 
HENDRY SEVEN TIMES 
THE GENIUS 
QUALITY IS SEPARATE TO THE WINNING 
MENTALITY IN JUST THE GENIUS PART 
JUST THE PURE BEING AT ONE WITH THE 
GAME BEING ABLE TO WIELD HIS CUE 
AND DO THINGS NO OTHER PLAYER HAS 
BEEN CLOSE TO THAT IS WHERE HE 
EXCELS IF HE GETS THE WINNING PART 
RIGHT AS WELL EVERYONE ELSE CAN GO 
HOME 
YOU NEVER KNOW BUT RONNIE HOME O'SULLIVAN IS RED HOT FAVOURITE TO 
WIN THIS WORLD SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIP 
THE OTHER SEMI FINAL IS ABOUT TO 
RESUME BOTH OF THESE PLAYERS ARE 
DESPERATE TO GET THE OPPORTUNITY 
THAT LIES IN FRONT OF THEM IT IT WOULD BE A NEW EXPERIENCE TO BE IN 
THE SEMI FINALS HERE L. AM NOT IN 
EXPERIENCED AS A PLAYER SO MAYBE 
THAT IS ON MY SIDE L. AM TWENTY NINE THIS 
YEAR L. AM THE DURING LATE PERHAPS 
WHEN I TURNED PROFESSIONAL I 
ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY AT THE 
CRUCIBLE L. ACHIEVED THAT A LITTLE 
WHILE AGO L. ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY 
IN THE ONE TABLE SET UP AND I HAVE 
ACHIEVED THAT ALWAYS WANTED TO 
PLAY IN A FINAL AND I HAVE THAT 
OBSTACLE TO OVERCOME 
JOE PERRY IS 
A TOUGH PLAYER BUT WHOEVER YOU PLAY 
IN THE SEMI FINALS WILL BE TOUGH 
HE IS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE IT 
WOULD BE NICE TO DO BATTLE 
I AM 
PLEASED I AM PLAYING ALI CARTER WE 
HAVE BECOME GOOD FRIENDS WHATEVER 
HAPPENS ONE OF US WILL BE IN THE 
FINAL AND I AM SURE WE WILL WISH 
EACH OTHER ALL THE BEST 
WITH TWO FIRST TIME SEMI FINALISTS 
THE FIRST SESSION WAS ALWAYS LIKELY 
TO BE NERVOUS AFFAIR ALI WAS 
FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO SETTLE AND 
JOKED ADVANTAGE TO WIN THE FIRST 
FRAME JOE TOOK ADVANTAGE 
IT WAS THE SAME STORY IN THE SECOND 
AND THIRD FRAMES ALI FLUFFED HIS 
LINES LEAVING JOE TO TAKE CENTRE 
STAGE THREE TO ZERO 
BUT ALI TOOK THE FRAMES EITHER SIDE 
OF THE INTERVAL TO PUT IT BACK TO 
THREE TO TWO AND HALT JOE'S PROGRESS 
IN FRAME SIX JOE HART EXTENDED HIS 
LEAD TO FOUR TO TWO WITH BREAK OF EIGHTY FOUR 
JOE EXTENDED HIS LEAD JOE WERE ALSO TOOK 
THE SEVENTH AND IN THE EIGHTH HE HAD CHANCE TO LEAD THE SESSION SIX TO TWO BUT HE LET IT GO 
ALI TOOK THE GIFT TRAILS FIVE TO THREE 
THE SECOND SESSION IS ABOUT TO GET 
UNDER WAY AS FOR THEIR 
PERFORMANCES IN RANKING EVENTS JOE 
PERRY HAS REACHED A RANKING FINAL 
THE TWO THOUSAND ONE EUROPEAN OPEN WHERE HE WAS 
BEATEN BY STEPHEN HENDRY THIS IS A 
NEW BALL GAME FOR ALI CARTER IT 
WOULD BE HIS FIRST RANKING FINAL 
AFTERNOON MACRO GOOD AFTERNOON 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN TOMORROW 
NIGHT IT WILL BE DOWN TO JUST TWO 
PLAYERS WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ADO 
LET'S GET THE BOYS ON THE BAIZE 
INTRODUCING FIRSTLY THE FORMER 
EUROPEAN OPEN FINALIST ENJOYING 
HIS BEST EVER RUN AT THE CRUCIBLE 
SHOWING NERVES OF STEEL AGAINST 
MAGUIRE IN THE QUARTER FINALS HERE 
COMES THE GENTLEMAN JOE PERRY 
AND HIS OPPONENT THE MAN OF THE 
MOMENT ON TUESDAY WITH A 
SENSATIONAL ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BIDDING FOR HIS 
FIRST CRUCIBLE FINAL HE REALLY IS 
FLYING THIS WAY THAT'S WHY HE IS 
THE CAPTAIN ALI CARTER 
GREAT ATMOSPHERE INSIDE THE 
CRUCIBLE THIS AFTERNOON IN THE 
COMMENTARY BOX CLIVE EVERTON AND 
DENNIS TAYLOR 
GOOD AFTERNOON RAY GOOD AFTERNOON 
EVERYONE ALI AND JOE AT THE 
CRUCIBLE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE GLOBAL 
APPEAL OF THE MUHAMMAD ALI AND JOE 
FRAZIER THRILLER IN MANILA BUT AN 
AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED 
IN IT IT IS A WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
SEMI FINAL AND THIS IS BY FAR THE 
BIGGEST MATCH OF NOT ONLY CARTER'S 
BUT PERRY'S CAREER 
THESE ARE UNEXPECTED SEMI FINALISTS 
THOUGH NONETHELESS DESERVED FOR 
THAT JOE PERRY HAS ONLY REACHED 
ONE FINAL AND TWO SEMIS THAT IS IN 
HIS SIXTEEN YEARS ON THE CIRCUIT 
AND IN TWELVE YEARS ALI CARTER HAS 
NEVER REACHED A FINAL AND ONLY TWO 
SEMIS 
THIS IS THE PLAYERS BACKSTAGE 
DOING AN IMPERSONATION OF ROB 
WALKER HE BRINGS SMILE TO THE 
PLAYERS' FACES AND EVERYONE IN THE 
CRUCIBLE THE BOYS AT CERTAIN YOU 
CERTAINLY WERE ENJOYING IT THERE 
IT IS ALL PRETTY SERIOUS NOW WHO 
IS GOING TO GET THROUGH TO THEIR 
FIRST EVER FINAL AT THE CRUCIBLE 
ANOTHER MILESTONE IN THEIR 
PROFESSIONAL CAREER JOE PERRY SAID 
CLIVE AS ALL PLAYERS WHEN THEY 
TURN PROFESSIONAL THEIR AMBITION 
IS TO PLAY IN THE CRUCIBLE WHEN 
THERE IS ONE TABLE SITUATION IT IT CERTAINLY IS A UNIQUE ATMOSPHERE 
THAT IS AID LITTLE GEM OF A SHOT 
THE POSITIONAL SIDE OF IT WAS VERY 
PRECISE THE BLACK TIED UP 
JUST ONE POSSIBLE POT NOTHING GOES 
INTO THAT CORNER BUT THERE IS ONE 
INTO THE LEFT MIDDLE 
ONLY EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT POT SUCCESS RATE FOR 
CARTER WHICH IS A LITTLE ON THE 
LOW SIDE HE NEEDS TO THE NINETY PLUS 
NEEDS TO BE 
BY ALI DID NOT SETTLE AS QUICKLY AS 
JOE PERRY AND THE BRAKES INDICATE 
THAT 
HIS HIGHEST BREAK WAS A SEVENTY THAT HE ALSO HAD A FORTY NINE JOE PERRY WAS 
MUCH MORE CONSISTENT 
HIS HIGHEST BREAK WAS EIGHTY FOUR BUT HE 
DID HAVE A FIFTY FOUR SIXTY TWO FORTY EIGHT SIXTY EIGHT SEVENTY TWO AND 
EIGHTY FOUR THAT IS PRETTY CONSISTENT 
CAN HE HOLED FOR THE PINK HE MIGHT 
HAVE TO GO UP FOR THE BLUE HE IT 
JUST DEPENDS ON THE ANGLE HOLD 
IT LOOKS AS IF HE WILL 
AND 
LEAVE THE BLUE ON 
A CRISIS WAS DEVELOPING LAST 
EVENING WHEN CARTER WAS FIVE TO TWO DOWN 
BUT HE MANAGED TO WIN THE REMAINING 
FRAME OF THE EVENING PERRY HAD HAD 
FIRST CHANCE THIS SHOWS US THAT 
CARTER HAS HIGHLY SATISFACTORY ANGLE ON THE BLUE 
I WOULD PLAY FOR THE RED NEAR THE 
CORNER POCKET IF HE POTS THIS IT 
WILL CLEAR THE PATH INTO THAT 
CORNER HE IS THINKING ALREADY TWO 
OR THREE OR FOUR SHOTS AHEAD 
THAT HAS GONE A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR 
THE JACQUES VARBRE RACE ARE 
AVAILABLE INTO THE RIGHT CORNER I 
THINK THEY ARE ALL BLOCKING EACH 
OTHER THE REDS ARE AVAILABLE HE 
WENT A BIT TOO FAR WITH THE CUE 
BALL 
THAT IS THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU ARE 
PLAYING LITTLE CANNONS YOU ARE NOT 
GUARANTEED TO FINISH PERFECT BUT I 
THINK HE IS O. K. 
HE MIGHT STILL BE ABLE TO GET 
THROUGH TO CUT ONE INTO THIS RIGHT 
CORNER 
WELL HE WILL HAVE TO GO WAY UP THE 
TABLE HE HAD TO TAKE ON THE THINNER ONE 
CARTER KNOWING THAT HE COULD NOT 
HOLD FOR BLUE HE MADE SURE HE GOT 
A GOOD POSITION ON HIS BAULK COLOUR 
YELLOW WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL RIGHT 
BUT BROWN WAS BETTER BECAUSE IT WAS 
STRAIGHT BACK OFF THE CUSHION AND 
ON TO THIS RED 
CHOICES OF REDS TO GET ON HERE HE 
COULD PLAY A LITTLE SCREW SHOT AND 
SLIP UP PAST THE PINK 
HE DOES NOT WANT TO DROPPING BEHIND 
IT HE NEEDED TO HIT IT HARDER THAN 
THAT THAT IS A POOR SHOT FROM ALI 
IT WAS THE CORRECT SHOT BUT HE 
NEEDED A BIT MORE PACE 
THE MARGINAL IMPRECISION IN HIS 
POSITIONAL SHOT BROUGHT THAT FORTY ONE 
BREAK TO AN END BUT CARTER WOULD 
HAVE BEEN WELL PSYCHED UP TO MAKE 
GOOD START RESUMING TWO FRAMES 
BEHIND 
LEFT OF CENTRE STRIKING AS CARTER 
LOOKED AT IT 
THAT IS PRETTY GOOD HE HAS COVERED 
THE ONE NEAR THE LEFT CORNER ALI 
HAS TO HIDE THAT RED IF HE COMES 
BACK DOWN THE TABLE 
THAT IS PRETTY GOOD IN FACT THE 
BLACK JUST CLIPPED THE RED AS WELL 
HE DID GET THE WHITE IN A GOOD 
POSITION IT IS ALWAYS NICE IF YOU 
CAN KILL THE FRAME WITH ONE VISIT 
ALI DID HAVE A CHANCE TO DO THAT 
HE JUST WENT SLIGHTLY OUT OF 
POSITION THIS IS THE SHOT HE 
PLAYED HE DID NOT QUITE HIT IT 
HARD ENOUGH AND IT HIT THE RED ON 
THE RIGHT SIDE AS WE LOOK AT IT 
THAT IS THE SORT OF SHOT HE WAS 
HOPING FOR HE COULD THEN HAVE 
PUSHED THE RED ON 
HE HAD TO TAKE A CHANCE WITH 
POSITION BECAUSE THE POTTING ANGLE 
WAS SO THIN 
THEY LOOK TO BE ALL COVERING EACH 
OTHER THE SETS OF REDS L. L. DON'T 
THINK THERE IS ANYTHING THAT POTS 
I THINK HE JUST HIT THAT TOO HARD 
HE WANTED TO BE ON THE TWO REDS 
NEAR THE PINK BUT JUST OVERHIT IT 
IT WAS A GOOD GREEN HE WAS HOPING 
TO FINISH SOMEWHERE NEAR THE OTHER 
WHITE I HAVE PUT ON 
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SHOTS WHERE HE 
WAS THINKING HE WOULD HAVE JOB TO 
HIT IT HARD ENOUGH AND HIT IT TOO 
HARD 
BUT THE TABLE IS PLAYING 
BEAUTIFULLY IT HAS TO BE SAID 
THAT IS WHY HE WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO 
HARD THE CLOTH IS SO LIVELY YOU 
NEED TO BE CUEING WELL TO CONTROL A 
FAST CLOTH THAT IS THE WAY THE 
PLAYERS LIKE IT 
GOOD SHOT FROM CARTER RESTRICTING 
PERRY TO A SINGLE RED 
THERE WAS A SLIGHT ANGLE WHERE IS 
THE RED GOING TO FINISH 
HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SNEAK THIS 
IN MIGHT JUST HAVE GOT AWAY WITH 
THAT JOE 
NO THAT WILL NOT CUT BACK HE CAN 
MAYBE TRY TO GET IN BEHIND THE 
BROWN BUT HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL HE 
DOES NOT SEND A RED ON TO THE 
YELLOW 
THE BLACK IS CAUSING A PROBLEM HE 
HAS TO MAKE SURE HE MISSES THAT IT 
IS RIGHT IN LINE OF THE SAFETY SHOT 
IF YOU COME OFF THE TOP CUSHION IT 
IS SO EASY TO CANNON INTO THAT 
WELL PERRY ON A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BUT NOT ON A 
BREAK 
JOE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND HE COULD 
NOT SEE SAFETY SHOT HE PULLED OUT A CRACKER 
WHAT IS THE SAYING GOOD GUYS DO 
NOT WIN 
YOU COULD NOT MEET TWO NICER LADS 
SOMETIMES THEY'D TO WIN 
BABY TO WIN DO WIN 
NEITHER OF THESE PLAYERS ARE MUCH 
THOUGHT OF BEFORE THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
IN TERMS OF REACHING THE FINAL OR 
EVEN THE SEMI FINALS BUT THEY ARE 
BASED HERE BOTH ALL VERY WELL 
SAYING THE BEST PLAYERS IN THAT 
HALF HAVE LOST THESE ARE THE BEST 
PLAYERS IN THAT HALF IN THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
HE NEEDS A GOOD ANGLE HE HAS GOT 
TO BE VERY PRECISE TO LEAVE HIMSELF 
A GOOD ANGLE TO GET HIMSELF INTO 
THE TWO REDS 
THE TWO REDS TOGETHER ARE THE 
PROBLEM WHAT SORT OF ANGLE L. DO 
NOT THINK HE CAN SCREW BACK AND 
MOVE THE TWO REDS 
IT WAS ALMOST STRAIGHT THIS LOOKS 
PRETTY STRAIGHT HE HAS GOT A SLIGHT ANGLE 
THOSE SHOTS ARE NOT MORE THAT HAVE 
ALL THAT TOUGH 
ALI CARTER DID HAVE A LOOK AT THE 
POTTING ANGLE ON THE RED 
HE GOT UP A DOUBLE KISS HE WAS A 
BIT FORTUNATE GOT A DOUBLE KISS NOT QUITE 
VERY WELL PICKED OUT HE DID WELL 
TO NOT CANNONED THE TWO REDS 
CANNON 
HE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT ONE 
AGAIN NO WONDER HE SMILES TO 
HIMSELF JOE HAS THE AWKWARD SHOT 
WITH THE BLACK HE CAN SEE THE REDS 
IT WAS A POOR SHOT FROM ALIOU 
ALI CARTER HE GOT HIMSELF INTO 
TROUBLE 
HE SHOULD HAVE LEFT PERRY TROUBLE SNOOKERED 
IT NEEDED TO BE THIN BUT NOT THAT 
THIN HE TENDED TO PLACE THE RED 
HE INTENDED TO PLACE THE RED ON THE 
SIDE CUSHION 
IT IS AMAZING THEY ARE ALWAYS 
ASKED TO TURN THEIR MOBILE PHONES 
OFF WHEN IT GOES OFF YOU CAN SEE 
THEM PANICKING TO PRESS THE BUTTON 
TO STOP IT FROM RINGING 
NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE SEATS 
IN THE CRUCIBLE 
FARIK INTERNET IT PROVIDES A 
UNIQUE AMBIENCE VERY INTIMATE 
HE PLAYED THAT PRETTY WELL THE RED 
WAS TIGHT ON THE CUSHION YES THE 
RED WAS TIGHT ON THE CUSHION 
THERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE OF LEAVING 
IT HARMFUL STUCK IT WAS QUITE TAKE 
GOOD POT 
THAT WAS A TERRIFIC 
LEAVING IT ON IT MADE IT EVEN MORE 
SPECIAL 
JOE PERRY WAS PLAIN TO COME ROUND 
THE BACK OF THE YELLOW PLAYING 
IF HE IS DEAD STRAIGHT INTO THE 
MIDDLE POCKET HE IS FORTUNATE 
THAT IS WHERE HE WAS HOPING TO GET 
THE WHITE IN THAT AREA HE 
UNDERHIT IT 
THEY ARE DIFFICULT WHENEVER THEY 
ARE CLOSE TOGETHER YOU DO NOT SEE 
A REACTION FROM JOE NORMALLY 
HE DID NOT ASSESS THE ANGLE 
CORRECTLY 
HIS REACTION SHOWED THAT HE FULLY 
REALISED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 
SHOT IF HE HAD POTTED THE YELLOW 
THERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE THAT HE 
WOULD INCREASE HIS LEAD TO SIX TO THREE THIS IS CARTER'S CHANCE TO CLOSE 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY THAT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN A BIG BOOST TO JOE PERRY TWO SNOOKERS NEEDED 
CARTER REDUCES HIS ARREARS TO FIVE TO FOUR 
IT IS IN LONG WAY TO GO UP IN THIS 
MATCH WHAT IS YOUR READING OF THE 
SITUATION IN 
I THINK IT IS VERY 
HARD FOUGHT DIFFICULT TO PICK A 
WINNER JOE GOT OFF TO MAKE ITS 
START YESTERDAY THE FRAMES ARE 
GOING TO GO LIKE THIS TO AND FRO 
I CANNOT PICK A WINNER 
THERE IS NO 
GUARANTEES THAT THEY WILL NOT 
SETTLE DOWN CHANCES ARE THAT AT 
SOME STAGE THEY WILL START TO GET 
INTO A FLOWN EVERY NOW AND THEN 
THE MATCH IS EDGY JOE WAS VERY 
FRUSTRATED WHEN HE MET POSITION UP 
ON THE YELLOW AND MISSED IT TO THE 
FAR JAW IT WAS A DIFFICULT SHOT 
HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO IT WHEN TWO 
BALLS ARE CLOSE SOMETIMES IT IS 
HARD TO GET A GOOD ROLE OF THE CUE 
BALL TO THE OBJECT BALL HE WAS 
VERY UPSET WITH HIMSELF HE 
MATTERED A BIT UNDER HIS BREATH L. 
WAS LISTENING TO WHAT YOU WERE 
SAYING IT IS ABOUT SELF BELIEF 
THEY HAVE TO BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES 
THAT THEY CAN WIN THE TITLE VERY VERY MUCH SO JOE HAS BEEN TO A FINAL IN 
THE EUROPEAN OPEN IT IS THE BIG 
ESTATE THESE TWO PLAYERS HAVE BEEN 
ON ASK 
TAKING UP THE POINT ABOUT SELF 
BELIEF ALI CARTER SAID BED HE HAD 
ALWAYS DREAMED OF MAKING EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN AT 
THE CRUCIBLE THAT HE FELT IF HE 
DID GET NEAR TO DOING IT HE WOULD 
NOT BE ABLE TO 
HE WAS PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PROVE 
HIMSELF WRONG 
HE SCREWED THE WHITE IN OFF AT 
LEAST THE RED NEXT TO THE YELLOW 
DOES NOT GO HE ALMOST MADE THE RED 
THEY RED HE DID NOT KNOCK THE OTHER 
RED INTO IS THE ONE THAT JOE PERRY 
WILL TAKE IT ON WHICH WAY WILL HE 
PLAY IT WILL HE GO FULL BLOODED 
WILL HE TRY TO BRING THE WHITE BACK 
UP THE TABLE 
HE OVERT DONE IT OVER IT WAS 
GOOD CUEING BUT HE GOT OVER TO 
MATCH THE BLUE IS PICKPOCKET 
WHERE THE BROWN IS SITTING IT 
MIGHT BE WORTH A GO A BIG POCKET 
HE WENT INSIDE THE BROWN HE HAD TWO CHANCES IT JUST WENT BETWEEN THE BROWN AND THE POCKET HE DID NOT PUSH THE CUE THROUGH IN 
A STRAIGHT LINE HE WAS STRETCHING 
A LITTLE BIT 
THAT WAS NOT TO JAIL'S FAULT THE 
ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT BECAUSE HE 
GOT THE HEAVY CONTACT THE WHITE 
WAS ALL RIGHT JOE THINK THE RED NEXT TO THE BLACK IS IN THE WAY 
THEY MIGHT DECIDE TO HAVE A RE RACK 
IT WAS MUTUALLY AGREED 
ONLY FIVE POINTS HAVE BEEN SCORED 
THAT WAS INSIGNIFICANT LET ME ASK 
YOU DENNIS SOMETIMES THE FRAME IS 
ABORTED WHEN SOMEBODY IS TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE IN 
FRONT D. NOT THINK THERE IS CASE 
FOR CARRYING BEFORE CARRYING 
FORWARD THE SCORES FROM AN ABORTED 
FRAME TO AT EIGHTY THREE RACKED FRAME 
I HAD 
NOT REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT YOU 
HAVE REACHED A STALEMATE IT 
HAPPENED WHEN STEVE DAVIS PLAYED 
TOMMY MURPHY TOMMY WAS FORTY IN FRONT 
THE REFEREE OFFERED THEM THREE 
SHOTS AND THEN THEY WOULD START 
AGAIN THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GET 
OUT OF IT L. HAVE NEVER THOUGHT 
ABOUT THAT INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT 
THEY THINK ABOUT THAT IN THE STUDIO 
FRAME TEN TAKE TWO JOE PERRY IS 
GOING TO TAKE ONE INTO THIS WHITE 
CORNER POCKET 
THAT GIVES HIM A VERY GOOD CHANCE 
THE REDS ARE NICELY SITUATED 
IF HE GETS THIS RIGHT HE CAN GIVE 
HIMSELF GREAT CHANCE OF OPENING THE BLACK UP 
HE IS FINE THE BLACK GOES INTO THE 
LEFT CORNER 
I SAY HE IS FINE HE JUST NEEDED 
ANOTHER INCH DO NOT THINK HE WILL CANNON THE BLACK IT WAS AN AWKWARD ANGLE 
THE REASON HE WENT INTO THE REDS IS 
BECAUSE OF THE ONE TO THE LEFT OF 
THE BLACK 
HE COULD CLEARLY GET THROUGH TO IT 
ANOTHER KICK IT WOULD BE NICE IF 
THE BLUE WOULD PASS THE OTHER RED 
YOU CAN SEE THE WHITE JUMPING IT 
IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE A BAULK 
COLOUR IF THE BLUE DOES NOT GO 
THERE IS ANY A BIT OF A POCKET 
ONLY 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEARER 
THE GREEN BUT FOR THE KICK 
NOT A PROBLEM AT THAT RANGE THIS THIS IS A LITTLE BIT HARD IS IT NO HE 
IS O. K. 
BECAUSE SINCE SEEM TO BE PLAYING 
VERY WELL 
IT IS ONLY THE SECOND 
DAY THAT THIS PARTICULAR CLASS HAS 
BEEN ON CLOTH IT SEEMS TO INFLUENCE THE BOUNCES 
TALKING ABOUT BOUNCES OFF CUSHIONS 
IN MIGHT EARLY DAYS WHEN 
PROFESSIONALS USED TO PLAY AT 
HOLIDAY CAMPS THE CUSHIONS WERE 
ONLY THERE TO STOP THE BALL FALLING 
ON THE FLOOR 
WHEN IT HIT THE CUSHION THE BALL 
DID NOT GO ANYWHERE 
I CAN REMEMBER 
AT ONE OF THE HOLIDAY CAMPS AND 
RAY REARDON STEADIED HIMSELF 
AGAINST THE CUSHION AND PULLING 
HIMSELF BACK SLIGHTLY AND HE PULLED 
THE CUSHION OF 
OFF 
THAT WAS JUST O. K. RAY 
REARDON WAS ALWAYS VERY STRONG 
EIGHT TYPICALLY NEAT BREAK FROM JOE 
PERRY 
HE HAS GOT A NICE FLOWING ACTION 
I LIKE HIS MANNERISMS AROUND THE 
TABLE HE JUST WANDERS ROUND IN 
ONE OF HIS MATCHES HIS SHOT TIME 
WAS DOWN TO SIXTEEN SECONDS HE WAS NOT 
DASHING AROUND THE TABLE 
HE MUST 
HAVE BEEN FLOWING VERY EASILY FROM 
SHOT TO SHOT 
HE TOOK HIS EYE OFF THE BLACK HOW 
MANY TIMES HAS JOE DANNATT IN THIS 
MATCH HE HAS GOT TO AT OVER FIFTY AND 
HE HAS MISSED STRAIGHT FORWARD TO 
SHOT SHOT 
I THINK THAT HAS 
PLAGUED HIM THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER 
HE WAS WITHIN A COUPLE OF POTS OF 
GOING SIX TO FOUR AHEAD 
THIS WILL HURT JOE PERRY IF ALI 
CARTER CAN CONVERT THIS CHANCE HE 
HAS A LONG WAIT TO GO HE SHOULD 
NOT HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE 
JOE PERRY SHOULD ALREADY HAD 
CLINCHED THE FRAME 
HAVE HE 
MIGHT PLAY FOR THAT DIFFICULT RED 
IT COULD WORK TO HIS ADVANTAGE 
DEPENDING ON THE ANGLE IF HE CAN 
POT THE BLACK HE WILL GET THE 
DIFFICULT ONE OUT OF THE WAY FIRST THAT IS O. K. WHAT HE CHANCE A CHANCE HE CAN DRAW LEVEL 
HEAT OVER SCREWED BACK SLIGHTLY HE 
WANTED A STRAIGHT RED AND PLAYED 
FOR THE BLUE 
HE HAS GOT TO DIRECT FROM THE BLACK 
IF HE HAS FINISHED DEAD STRAIGHT 
HE HAS MADE IT AWKWARD IT DEPENDS 
WHERE HE HAS FINISHED IF HE IS 
JUST OFF STRAIGHT HE MIGHT BE ABLE 
TO PUNCH THE BLACK 
IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT HE GOT 
NICELY ON THE YELLOW HE NEEDS ALL THE COLOURS 
YOU COULD SEE THE BACK HAND OF ALI 
CARTER YOU DO NOT GRIP THE CUE TOO 
TIGHTLY 
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE A PROBLEM 
CLEARING UP HAVING SAID THAT HE 
HAS LEFT HIMSELF STRAIGHT ON THE 
BLUE HE DID IT UNDER EXTREME 
PRESSURE WHEN HE MAKE THE MAXIMUM 
BREAK MADE IT IS A TRICKY PINK 
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER IF HE 
HAD NOT BEEN STRAIGHT ON THE BLUE 
TEST THE PRESSURE HE WAS FEELING 
THE TENSION JUST IT AN 
INSTANCE WHERE HE WOULD HAVE POTTED 
IT NORMALLY 
THIS IS A VERY TOUGH CUT BACK I AM 
LOOKING AT IT IF HE DOES TAKE THE 
POT ON HE WILL HAVE TO GO ALL THE 
WAY DOWN THE TABLE AND BACK AGAIN THAT IS THE ANGLE HE IS LOOKING AT 
HE WENT FOR THE THIN SAFETY IT WAS 
A GOOD CHOICE UNDER THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES 
HE IS IN DIFFICULTY BUT AT LEAST 
HE IS STILL IN THE FRAME HE DIDN'T 
EXPECT TO BE 
NOT THE BEST BUT A MUCH MORE 
DIFFICULT PINK THAN THE ONE ALI 
MISSED HE CAN TAKE IT INTO THE 
RIGHT CORNER HE COULD FINISH ON 
THE BLACK HE COULD TAKE IT IN THE 
LEFT CORNER AND FINISH ON THE 
BLACK BOTH POTS ARE TOUGH 
LOOKS LIKE HE PREFERS THE LEFT 
CORNER NO HE HASN'T LEFT IT AT LEAST ADVANTAGE JOE PERRY 
NOW THIS IS TOUGH IF HE TRIED TO 
DOUBLE THE PINK BACK UP THE TABLE 
HE COULD QUITE EASILY CAPTURE THE 
BLACK SO HE HAS GOT TO BE PRECISE 
WITH THIS 
IF HE MISSES THE BLACK THE PINK 
WOULD HAVE GONE UP PAST THE BROWN 
SPOT BUT IT WAS SO IT TOUGH TO 
AVOID CANNONING INTO THE BLACK 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE THE POT ON 
THEN HE SEEMED TO GET DOWN AND TAKE 
IT QUICKLY 
HE GOT UP VERY QUICKLY 
IN DISGUST ALMOST KNOCKED THE PINK 
AND THE CUE BALL IN 
THAT IS A GOOD SHOT BOTH PLAYERS 
HAVE HAD GREAT CHANCE IS TO WIN 
THIS FRAME GREAT CHANCES AT AT LEAST THERE IS A CHANCE IF YOU GET 
THIS RIGHT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT 
A BIT 
OF DISTANCE 
BETWEEN THE CUE 
BALL AND THE PINK BUT CAN HE GET 
THE RIGHT ANGLE OFF HERE HE DID 
HE DID HE PLAYED THAT VERY WELL HE HAS GOT A GOOD SAFETY GAME PERRY 
TELL YOU WHAT THAT WAS A GREAT 
EFFORT JOE HAS NOW GOT THE CHANCE 
BUT THIS WAS SO CLOSE FRAME BALL 
CARTER COULD ONLY SIT IN HIS CHAIR 
AND HOPE THAT PERRY DID NOT POT THE 
PINK NOW HE HAS GOT A CHANCE 
HIMSELF TO TAKE PINK AND BLACK 
THIS PROBABLY EVEN TOUGHER THAN THE 
ONE AT JOE ATTEMPTED THERE THE 
ONE THAT JOE ATTEMPTED THERE HE 
HAS GOT TO PLAY IT WITH QUITE A BIT 
OF SCREW IF HE WANTS TO GET ONTO 
THE BLACK YES 
OF PERRY HAD A GREAT CHANCE TO GO 
SIX TO FOUR UP 
CARTER HAD MISSED A CHANCE HIMSELF 
BUT FINALLY GET HOME ON THE BLACK 
TO LEVEL THE MATCH 
I GUESS THE 
TENSION IS GOING TO GROW AND GROW 
AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE 
MOMENTS LIKE THAT YOU PICKED A 
SHOT OUT IN THAT FRAME WHICH YOU 
THINK IS SIGNIFICANT 
IT IS 
BECAUSE IT IS A SIMPLE SHOT MOST 
PLAYERS IN THE WORLD IF YOU LOOK 
AT THIS I WOULD ALWAYS BE PLAYING 
OFF THE BROWN OF FOR THE SIDE 
CUSHION GUARANTEED POSITION TO 
STAY THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BLUE IT 
IS AMAZING HOW MANY PLAYERS OVER 
SCREW IT AND LEAVE THEMSELVES 
STRAIGHT ON THE BLUE FURTHER AWAY 
FROM THE PINK YOU HAVE GOT TO BE 
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BLUE THEN 
YOU'RE PERFECT ON THE PINK 
I THINK 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN WOULD PLAY THAT 
SHOT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT OFF THE 
SIDE CUSHION IT WOULD MEAN THAT 
YOU'RE LEAVING YOURSELF CAN 
POSITION FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF 
TIME BUT EVERYBODY HAS GOT THEIR 
OWN WAYS OF PLAYING THE SHOT THAT 
CAUSED ALI CARTER A LOT OF PROBLEMS 
WHEN HE MISSED THE PINK AFTER THAT 
TOUGH TO CALL WHICH WAY THIS MATCH 
IS GOING TO DEVELOP 
THEY ARE BOTH 
LOOKING VERY NERVOUS A LONG WAY TO 
GO YET 
A QUESTION WAS POSED ON THE 
COMMENTARY BOX IF THERE IS A RE 
RACK SHOULD BE CARRIED OVER IT IT IS CLIVE'S YOU THAT IT IS A 
POSSIBILITY IT IS OFTEN THE 
QUICKEST WAY TO GET RID OF A FRIEND 
WHEN SOMEBODY HAS GOT A BIG LEAD 
AND THE OTHER GUY IS TRYING TO GET 
BACK IN THE GAME ONE PLAYER TRIES 
TO CLOSE OF THE GAME AND THE OTHER 
TRIES TO OPEN IT IT IS A TOUGH ONE 
MOST TIMES I DON'T THINK IT COMES 
INTO THE EQUATION YOU COULD ASK 
THE REFEREE'S OPINION IN HIS ONE 
PLAYER WAS TRYING TO BE TOO 
DEFENSIVE AND FORCE IRAQ 
IT IS 
GENERALLY UP TO THE PLAYER WHO IS 
IN FRONT IF YOU HAVE GOT A FORTY 
POINT LEAD IT IS GENERALLY YOUR 
PREROGATIVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT 
IT YOU DON'T WANT TO STILL MADE 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOT THE LEAD IT 
IS INTERESTING BUT IT IS THE WAY 
THE COOKIE CRUMBLES 
YOU ASKED AND 
WE ANSWERED 
IT IS A TALKING POINT 
STILL 
THOSE TWO IN THE STUDIO SHOULD BE 
POLITICIANS THEY DIDN'T REALLY 
ANSWER THE QUESTION 
MY ANSWER BY THE WAY IS IN NO 
IS NO 
NOT A GOOD SAFETY HERE AND MR. 
GREEN CAME TO THE RESCUE UNLESS 
THE GREEN THE GREEN MAY HAVE COME 
TO THE RESCUE TO THE RIGHT POCKET 
THAT IS VERY VERY TIGHT 
LOOK AT THAT FRACTIONS THAT IS 
WHAT THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT 
CARTER MUST BE FEELING PRETTY GOOD 
AT THAT MOMENT BECAUSE LAST 
EVENING HE WAS FIVE TO TWO DOWN HE WON 
THE REMAINING FRAME OF THE DAY AND 
HAS WON THE FIRST TWO THIS 
AFTERNOON HE HAS LEVELLED AT FIVE TO FIVE 
ALWAYS HAVE TO PUT THAT DOWN AS A 
BAD MISTAKE WE ALL KNOW WHERE THE 
POCKETS ARE YOU SHOULDN'T REALLY 
HIT THE CUE BALL ANYWHERE CLOSE TO 
IT 
THAT IS THE TYPE OF SHOT THAT 
PLAYERS OF PRACTICE HOUR UPON HOUR 
THAT WAS UCKY POTTED THE BLUE 
AND THEN THE RED FLASHED OUT OF THE 
BUNCH AND INTO THE CORNER POCKET 
THE WHITE AS WELL SO THIS RED IS 
ON 
NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR JOE PERRY AND 
HIS FANS HE MISSED THAT BY A LONG 
WAY MAYBE HE IS STILL THINKING 
ABOUT THE PREVIOUS FRAME LET'S 
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS AGAIN THE PINK 
STRAIGHT ON TO THE RED AND IN THE 
POCKET L. DON'T SUPPOSE YOU WOULD 
EXPECT TO KNOCK A PLANT LIKE THAT 
IN 
BUT GOING BACK TO JOE'S SHOT HE 
MISSED IT BY QUITE A WAY 
FROM THE BAULK LINE PERRY WOULD BE 
DISAPPOINTED TO MISS THAT BUT HE 
MUST BE IRRITATED TO HAVE LOST THE 
LAST FRAME 
OVER A SEMI FINAL MATCH AT THE 
CRUCIBLE YOU HAVE GOT TO PUT SHOTS 
LIKE THAT AND FRAMES LIKE THAT 
COMPLETELY TO THE BACK OF YOUR MIND 
HE SITTING AT FIVE TO FIVE SO WHY WORRY 
ABOUT THAT NOW HE IS POTTING BALLS 
THAT HE'S NOT PLAYING TO POT 
IT IS NOT A GOOD SIGN WHEN YOU 
MISS THE BALLS YOU WERE TRYING TO 
POT AND POT BUBBLES YOU'RE NOT 
TRYING TO POT THE BALLS YOU WERE 
NOT TRYING TO 
THIS IS A TRICKY ONE AS WELL IF HE 
POTS IT HE MAY AVOID THE CANNON 
INTO THE REDS THERE IF HE MISSES 
THE POT HE COULD GO INTO THEM WHAT A SHOT THAT IS 
THE TABLE HAS GOT TO RUN A PRETTY 
TRUE TO RUN PAUL THAT TYPE OF 
SHOT ON DEAD WEIGHT TO DROP ON 
THE BLACK TEN OUT OF TEN FOR THAT CERTAIN TO BE ON THE BACK RED 
ALI IS CERTAINLY LOOKING THE MORE 
CONFIDENT AT THE MOMENT AND I 
SUPPOSE THE FACT HE HAS WON THREE 
FRAMES IN A ROW IS CAUSING THAT 
I THINK CARTER OF THE TWO PLAYERS 
IS THE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE AN 
INSPIRED RUN PERRY I WOULD THINK 
OF AS SLIGHTLY MORE SOLID 
BUT BOTH OF THEM I'M CERTAIN WILL 
BE GOING INTO THIS MATCH THINKING 
THAT THEY MAY NOT EVER GET SUCH 
GOOD CHANCE TO REACH A FINAL AT THE 
CRUCIBLE 
JUST LOOKING AT THE REDS THEY ARE 
NOT IDEALLY PLACED BY GUINEA MEANS 
BY ANY MEANS L. THINK HE'S GOING 
TO NEED A CANNON IN A COUPLE OF 
SHOTS TIME L. THINK HE HAS GOT AN 
ANGLE ON THE BLACK JUST TO RUN 
ROUND AND LEAVE THAT RED THAT IS 
NEAR THE MIDDLE POCKET PLAYING 
WITH A BIT OF RIGHT HAND SIDE A 
LITTLE BIT MORE PACE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN BETTER UNLESS THERE IS ONE OF 
THAT GOES INTO THE BUNCH BUT I 
DON'T THINK THERE IS HE PLAYED FOR 
THAT LOOSE RED THERE 
THIS IS PERFECT NOW THAT IS IF HE 
CAN GET THE CANNON CORRECTLY IN 
FACT HE HAS GOT A CHOICE HERE IF 
HE GOES STRAIGHT INTO THE PINK 
THAT IS GOOD BUT EVEN IF HE SLIPS 
PAST THE PINK ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND 
CANNONS THE RED FULL BALL HE WOULD 
OPEN THE BUNCH OF FOUR UP THAT IS 
WHAT HE IS THINKING ABOUT NOW 
HE HIT THE PINK HE DIDN'T PLAY 
THAT BUT IT MAY BE OKAY AT LEAST 
HE HAS STILL GOT A POT ON ONLY 
JUST MISSED A SHOT BY A FRACTION 
WORKED OUT NOT TOO BADLY 
OVERCOAT THOUGH CARTER PERHAPS 
WONDERING WHETHER THE CANNON WAS 
GOING TO WORK OUT OVER CARDS 
THOUGH 
NOW CAN JOE PERRY REVERSE THE 
ROLES HERE 
AND DO TO ALI CARTER WHAT HE DID TO 
HIM IN THE PREVIOUS FRAME 
WELL NOT GOOD 
ONCE YOU PUT THE 
RED ONTO THE NEAR JAW AT THAT PACE 
NO WAY IT WILL GO IN HE JUST SEEMS 
TO BE SUFFERING A LITTLE BIT JOE 
AND MAYBE HE HAS STILL GOT SOME OF 
HIS THOUGHTS FROM THE PREVIOUS 
FRAME WHICH HE HAS GOT TO FORGET 
ABOUT 
I'M WONDERING IF HE'S GOT AN ANGLE 
ON THE GREEN TO GET INTO THE FOUR 
REDS AND HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER BUT THE RED 
STILL PASSES THE PINK BUT IT IS A 
TRICKY ONE 
I'M CERTAIN CARTER WAS EXPECTING A 
BETTER RESULT HE HIT THE GREEN SO 
WELL SAW THE CUE BALL GO TOWARDS 
THE CLUSTER TERRIFIC 
THE RED HAD A LONG WAY TO ROLL BUT 
IT WAS ONLY JUST OFF STRAIGHT AND 
A NATURAL ANGLE FOR POSITION 
SO THIS IS CARTER'S CHANCE AND A 
VERY GOOD ONE TO TAKE THE LEAD FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN THE MATCH 
AND IF HE DOES GO ON TO TAKE THIS 
FRAME IT WOULD BE SIX FRAMES OUT 
OF THE LAST EIGHT HE LOST THE 
FIRST THREE SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO 
SAY THAT ALI IS TAKING CONTROL OF 
THIS MATCH 
SOCA IT HAS CUT THIS FRAME IN THE 
BAG SOCA HAS GOT THIS FRAME IN 
THE BAG 
IT WAS ALI WHO LOOKED A BIT EDGY AT 
THE START OF THIS MATCH BUT HE'S 
CERTAINLY THE MORE CONFIDENT PLAYER 
NOW OF THE TWO 
THERE IS NOTHING 
LIKE WINNING FEW FRAMES TO GIVE A PLAYER CONFIDENCE 
HE WAS FIVE TO TWO DOWN HE IS GOING TO BE SIX TO FIVE UP 
YOU SOMETIMES SEE THAT SHOT TRYING 
TO GET THE CUE BALL NEARER THE PINK 
FROM THE BLUE VIA THE TOP MIDDLE 
POCKET AND THE FRAME IS WELL WON 
BREAKS OF THIRTY EIGHT AND FIFTY SIX IN THAT FRAME 
FROM ALI CARTER WHO IS IN FRONT 
FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THERE WAS A SHOT EARLIER IN THE 
FRAME THAT ALI PLAYED HE WAS 
LITTLE BIT AWKWARD ON THE BLACK HE 
WAS JUST OFF STRAIGHT HE COULDN'T 
GET INTO THE REDS SO HE HAS TO 
PLAY FOR THE REDS IN NEARER THE 
MIDDLE POCKET AND HE IS PLAYING 
THIS WITH TOP SPIN HE IS STRIKING 
ROUNDABOUT THAT SPOT WITH TOP SPIN 
SO WHEN HE HITS THE BLACK IT COMES 
OFF THE TOP CUSHION SIDE CUSHION 
AND OUT ON THE REDS BUT YOU MUST 
FOLLOW THROUGH HE DIDN'T QUITE HIT 
IT HARD ENOUGH BUT WHAT TOP SPIN 
WATCHED THE TOP SPIN STRAIGHT 
AROUND THE RED WOULD HAVE BEEN 
BETTER BUT THAT IS HOW YOU PLAY 
WITH A TOP SPIN YOU'RE HITTING THE 
BALL AT ROUGHLY ONE O'CLOCK L. SHOULD 
EXPLAIN ONE O'CLOCK WHEN YOU'RE 
TEACHING YOU USE THE CUE BALL AS 
CLOCK FACE A GOOD WAY OF LEARNING 
THE GAME 
SO JOE PERRY HAS GOT TO GET HIS 
ACT TOGETHER 
LAST FRAME BEFORE THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL 
BOTH OF THESE PLAYERS SPENT THE 
LAST FEW SEASONS JUST INSIDE OR 
JUST OUTSIDE THE TOP SIXTEEN THEIR TOP 
SIXTEEN PLACES ARE SECURE IN THE END OF 
SEASON RANKINGS WHICH WILL BE 
ISSUED ON TUESDAY MORNING 
A GOOD POT BUT A BIT UNLUCKY THE 
WAY IT HAS FINISHED THERE HE IS 
HAMPERED ON THE PINK TOO DIFFICULT 
THE POT ON THE BLACK 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH HE WANTS TO TAKE 
THE BLACK ON BUT HE HAS WALKED 
AWAY FROM IT AND NOW HE'S GOING TO 
PLAY THE YELLOW TO GET THE WHITE 
TIGHT ON THAT BALL CUSHION BAULK 
CUSHION 
BOTH THESE PLAYERS HAVE COME HERE 
MORE MATCH TIRED THAN THEY HAVE 
EVER BEEN BECAUSE IT IS ANY EVENT 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SNOOKER WHICH IS 
A QUALIFIER FOR BARRY HEARN'S 
SEVEN MAN PREMIER LEAGUE WHICH 
TOURS THE COUNTRY 
IT IS A VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM THERE 
ARE FOUR GROUPS IN THE CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE THE TOP PLAYER GOES THROUGH 
TO THE WINNERS GROUP THE BOTTOM 
TWO DROP OUT AND BOTH PERRY AND 
WHO WON THE GROUP AT HIS FOURTH 
ATTEMPT AND CARTER GOT SOME 
VALUABLE MUCH PRACTICE FROM THE NEW 
EVENT MATCH PRACTICE 
HE CAN DO 
IT IS A PAID THAT HAPPENING 
COULDN'T ANTICIPATE THAT HAPPENING 
HE COULDN'T ANTICIPATE A RED 
SPRINGING OUT OF THE BUNCH AND 
FINISHING OVER A POCKET 
THAT IS A WEE BIT UNLUCKY 
DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE WHITE HERE 
FOR ALI CARTER BUT HE COULD GET 
HIMSELF ONTO THE PINK HE WAS 
THINKING ABOUT PLAYING AN 
EXHIBITION TYPE SHOT 
NO HE JUST ROLLED IT IT COULD 
HAVE BEEN BETTER 
THE TUBAL CAUGHT THE CORNER POCKET 
JAW HE ANTICIPATED THE CUE BALL 
BOUNCING OUT FURTHER CUE BALL 
HE COURTED SLIGHTLY TO FALL 
CAUGHT IT 
THAT IS TERRIFIC CUEING FROM NEAR 
THE CUSHION 
HE IS ON THE CUSHION AGAIN BUT THE 
RED CLOSEST TO THE WHITE IS MUCH 
EASIER THAN THE ONE HE LOOKED AT 
INTO THE CORNER 
THAT HAS LEFT HIM PERFECTLY ON THE 
BLUE 
I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ANGLE TO PUT 
THE WHITE ON TO THE YELLOW NICE 
LITTLE STOPPER 
THAT JUST AT THE RED AWAY FROM THE 
BLACK SPOT AREA THAT JUST TOOK 
THE BLACK SPOT IS CLEAR MIDSESSION 
INTERVAL COMING UP JOE PERRY KNOWS 
THERE IS POSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD LOSE ALL FOUR FRAMES 
HE DOES NOT HAVE TO GO INTO THEM 
HERE IT IS THE PERFECT BUNCHED UP 
TO CANNON INTO 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF RIDES 
AVAILABLE INTO THE ROAD INTO THE 
RIGHT CORNER A COUPLE OF REDS 
THERE IS NO POINT IN TRYING TO 
DEVELOP A FEW THERE 
HE HAS NOT GOT QUITE ENOUGH SIDE TO 
GET HIM THE CORRECT SIDE OF THE 
BLUE BUT THE TWO REDS TO THE RIGHT 
ARE NOT BADLY PLACED THE ONLY 
THING IS IT WILL BE SLIGHTLY LONGER POT THAN HE WOULD HAVE LIKED 
HE HAS SCREWED IT A LITTLE BIT 
FURTHER THAN HE ANTICIPATED IT IS 
EVEN MORE DIFFICULT NOW 
A GOOD CHANCE TO CLINCH A SEVEN TO FIVE LEAD 
THIS 
I THINK HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO THIS DROP THE BLACK IN AND IF HE COMES 
OFF THE TOP CUSHION AND LEAVES THE 
WHITE AT THE END OF THE LINE HE 
HAS A CHOICE OF THREE REDS THAT IS FINE 
HIS HIGHEST BREAK HAS BEEN SEVENTY IN 
FRAME NUMBER FIVE 
PERRY'S HIGHEST BREAK HIS EIGHTY FOUR HE 
HAS SCORED MORE HEAVILY 
BUT IT IS CARTER WHO HAS WON MORE 
FRAMES 
FUNNILY ENOUGH LAST SEASON ALI 
ONLY MADE SEVEN CENTURY BREAKS 
THIS SEASON HE HAS ALREADY MADE TWENTY TWO 
HE IS MUCH MORE CONSISTENT HE HAS PINCHED THE FRAME AND IT 
ALSO SHOWS THAT HE HAS BEEN PLAYING 
CHAMPIONSHIP SNOOKER HE HAS PLAYED 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN FRAMES IN THAT 
YES THAT IS 
MUCH BETTER THAN BEING IN YOUR CLUB 
PUTTING IN HOURS AND HOURS OF 
PRACTICE YOU CANNOT BEAT MATCH 
PRACTICE 
IF CARTER COULD COMPLETE THE 
CENTURY IT WOULD BE HIS FOURTH 
INCLUDING OF COURSE HIS NEVER TO 
BE FORGOTTEN ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
HE MIGHT JUST HAVE SPOILED THE 
CHANCE OF GETTING A CENTURY HE 
UNDERHIT THAT QUITE A DELICATE 
SHOT TO TRY TO POT THE BLACK AND 
TAN AND THE REDS CANNON THE REDS 
VERY WELL PLAYED 
YES THE FRAME IS WELL WON BUT THE 
CROWD ALWAYS LIKES TO SEE CENTURY 
THE FIFTY SIXTH CENTURY OF THE TOURNAMENT 
IS ASSURED 
THE RECORD FOR CENTURIES MADE IN A 
CHAMPIONSHIP HERE IS WITHIN SIGHT 
THAT RECORD IS SIXTY EIGHT 
A VERY SATISFACTORY AFTERNOON'S 
WORK FOR ALI CARTER HE HAS WON ALL 
FOUR FRAMES 
CAPTAIN CARTER HAS TAKEN OFF HE 
HAS HAD A TERRIFIC SESSION YES YES AND GIVEN THE CHANCE OF THE TWO 
PLAYERS YOU WOULD EXPECT CARTER TO 
BE MORE OF THE FLYING MACHINE A 
GREAT BREAK BUILDER REFLECTING THE 
GAME WE SAW THIS MORNING BETWEEN 
HENDRY AND O'SULLIVAN JOE PERRY 
FROM FIVE TO TWO IN FRONT WILL BE VERY 
DISAPPOINTED WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
IN HIS GAME TO ALLOW THE OTHER MAN 
BACKING TO IT 
IT IS NOT AS BAD AS 
THAT YET FOR JOE BUT HE HAS TO 
STOP THE ROT 
IT IS THE FIRST 
QUESTION HE HAS BEEN ASKED IN THE 
SEMI FINAL WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN FIVE TO TWO 
UP AND YOU ARE SEEING FRAMES 
GETTING WHITTLED AWAY ALI LOOKS 
THE MOST CONFIDENT AT THE MOMENT 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS ON HOW THE 
PLAYERS ARE DEALING WITH THE 
OCCASION THEY WILL POT A FEW AND 
MISS FEW BUT DEALING WITH THE OCCASION 
ALI YESTERDAY HAD A LOOK OCCASION AROUND THE PLACE IT TOOK HIM A 
WHILE TO SETTLE AND HE IS NOW 
COMFORTABLE IN THE VENUE TODAY HE 
HAS BEEN THE BETTER PLAYER 
WHAT DO 
YOU THINK ABOUT THE WAY THE PLAYERS 
ARE DEALING WITH THE OCCASION ALI ALI SEEMS TO HAVE FREED OFF ANY EARLY 
NERVES WORRYING TIMES IF A PLAYER 
STARTS TO GET FROZEN IN THE 
HEADLIGHTS THAT CAN HAPPEN YOU 
DON'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN ON THE ONE 
TABLE SET UP 
THE PLAYERS WILL BE 
BACK SOON NEWS NOW A NEW 
INITIATIVE TO HELP CHILDREN DEVELOP 
THEIR SKILLS FOR TOP WHENEVER MET 
WHENEVER A MAJOR SNOOKER TOURNAMENT 
COMES AROUND WE REMEMBER AND THIS 
MASTERS CHAMPION PAUL HUNTER 
MISSISSIPPI 
HE JUST NEVER STOPPED PLAYING MISS SNOOKER THE TABLE FITTED ON A 
SNOOKER TABLE AND EVERYBODY HAD TO

COACHES ARE INCORPORATING SNOOKER 
HISTORY INTO THEIR SESSIONS ONE

YOUR AMBITIONS AND THE GAME TO TO TURN PROFESSIONAL NEXT YEAR AND 
HOPEFULLY PLAY AT THE CRUCIBLE ONE 
DAY 
OVER THE COURSE OF HIS DAY CHAMPIONSHIP WE HAVE SEEN 
GRAPHOLOGIST ELAINE QUICKLY ANALYSE 
SOME OF THE HANDWRITING OF THE 
PLAYERS LET'S SEE WHAT THE WRITING 
ON THE PAGE REVEALS ABOUT SOME OF 
THE PUNDITS ELAINE QUIGLEY 
THREE PEOPLE HAVE KINDLY GIVEN ME 
SELECTION OF ITEMS A TREE STARS 
OVER THE SEA AND HANDWRITING 
WANT TO GET COMPOSITE OF WHAT 
THEY ARE LIKE THROUGH THESE THREE 
DIFFERENT MEDIUMS LOOKING AT THE 
WRITING FIRST WE HAVE VERY UPWARD 
SLOPING LINES THIS IS A GOOD THING 
BUT IN THIS CASE THEY ARE SLIPPING 
UP TOO MUCH SO IT SHOWS THAT THIS 
PERSON IS PUTTING EFFORT INTO BEING 
VERY POSITIVE MAYBE BECAUSE HE 
DOES NOT WANT TO DO THIS PARTICULAR 
TASK VERY STRONG PERSONAL PRONOUNS 
VERY NICE AND FLOWING WRITING ALSO 
THE THE STENNACK IS THE OLD 
FASHIONED ONE GOING TO THE LEFT AND 
THAT MEANS USUALLY THAT THEY DON'T 
WANT TO BE EXPOSED IT ALSO CAN 
MEAN AN ACADEMIC APPROACH TO LIFE 
THE BIG WIDE MARGIN OVER FROM THE 
RIGHT SIDE MUCH NARROWER ON THE 
LEFT THIS IS TELLING ME THAT THIS 
PERSON DOES NOT WANT ME TO KNOW 
ABOUT HIM HE WANTS TO BE HIS OWN 
MAN HE HAS QUITE LOT OF WARMTH 
IN HIS WRITING HE IS AN INDIVIDUAL 
HE DOES NOT WANT PEOPLE TO PRY INTO 
HIS PERSONALITY TO FIND OUT 
WHETHER THIS IS ACTUALLY A TRUE 
STORY FIRST OF ALL THE TREE THIS 
DOES BEAR THIS OUT IT IS VERY 
SMALL IT IS A VERY PRIVATE LITTLE 
TREE AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE IT HAS 
A LOT OF LEAVES WHICH IS GOOD A 
VERY TINY TRUNK THEY ARE BOTH 
QUITE WELL DRAWN HE IS SHOWING ME 
HE IS ALL RIGHT WITH WHO HE IS THE 
STARS ARE NOT STARS AT ALL THEY DO 
NOT TWINKLE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY 
REAL LIFE TO THEM THE STARS ARE 
VERY EVENLY PLACED SO NOT NATURAL 
AND NOT LOOKING LIVELY THEN WE 
HAVE THIS RATHER LARGE BOLD SHAPED 
PIECE OF PLAIN STROKE AND THE WAVE 
UNDERNEATH IT THIS PERSON IS 
SAYING TO ME IT IS NOT YOUR 
BUSINESS WHAT I AM LIKE WE KNOW HE 
HAS A MOTIONS THAT IS WHAT THE 
WAVES ARE UNDERNEATH WE KNOW HE 
HAS SOME GOALS EMOTIONS THE 
NEXT ONE COMING UP IS A VERY MUCH 
DIFFERENT PIECE OF WRITING FIRST 
OF ALL WE HAVE LOVELY FLOWING 
WRITING IT SLOPES TO THE RIGHT IT 
IS SOMEONE WHO IS VERY CAREFUL 
PREPARATION PERSON HE WILL DO 
EVERYTHING AS BEST AS HE CAN IT IS 
NOT A HEAVY PRESSURED WRITING 
THERE IS CALMNESS ABOUT IT IT IS 
NICELY LAID OUT THE MARGIN ON THE 
LEFT HAND SIDE IS GOOD HE FEELS 
COMFORTABLE IN HIS SKIN IF WE LOOK 
AT HIS TREE THE TREE IS NICE 
TREE IT HAS PROPER SHAPING IT IS 
NOT SHOVED UP IN THE CORNER WE 
HAVE NICE STRONG TRUNK WITH A 
LOT OF LEAVES A LOT OF LEAVES AND 
MEAN PRODUCTIVITY HE HAS A 
PRODUCTIVE THINKING PACK IN 
THINKING PATTERN HE FEELS WHATEVER 
HE IS DOING HE DOES NOT HAVE TO 
WORRY ABOUT WHETHER HE IS GOING TO 
BE UNHAPPY WITH SOMETHING THERE IS 
NO PRESSURE ON THE BACK NO 
PRESSURE ON THE BACK OF THE WRITING 
THAT MEANS THIS PERSON IS VERY 
SENSITIVE TO PEOPLE AND TO 
ATMOSPHERE WE ARE COMING TO STARS 
AND WAVES OF THE EMOTIONS HERE ARE 
QUITE CALM HE IS NOT AN EMPTY 
PERSON HE HAS A LOT OF WARMTH THE 
STARS ARE QUITE BUSY HE HAS LOTS 
OF IDEAS AND AMBITIONS BUT THEY 
ARE NOT MAJOR HE IS QUITE CONTENT 
HE DOES NOT LOOK FOR MORE THAN THAT 
HE IS IN COMFORTABLE WAY THIS IS 
THE LAST ONE I WAS GIVEN WE HAVE 
THE WRITING THE WRITING IS VERY 
FLOWING WRITING WHICH CAN BE 
PLEASANT AND WARM IT IS ALL OVER 
THE PLACE TOO A LOT OF EMOTION 
HERE IT IS NOT SHOWN GET THE 
IMPRESSION THE WAY THE WRITING IS 
PUT TOGETHER WITH SOME LETTERS 
GOING BACKWARDS TO THE LEFT HE 
MIGHT BE OUT GOING IN BEHAVIOUR 
BUT NOT TO SHARE WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
HIMSELF HE NEEDS SOMETHING THAT IS 
GOING TO PUSH HIM INTO THE 
STRATOSPHERE SOME EXCITEMENT OR 
SOMETHING TO SET HIM GOING THE 
TREE SHOWS VERY STRONG TRUNK IT 
HAS ROOTS IT HAS BRANCHES AT THE 
TOP THE LEAVES HAVE NOT COME YET 
HE HAS GOT ALL THIS ENERGY AND HE 
IS WANTING SOMEWHERE TO PUT IT 
WHERE HE WILL MAKE SOME NEW FRESH 
SPURT IN HIS LIFE NEW EXPERIENCE 
THAT WILL MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD IF WE 
LOOK AT THE STARS WE GET THE SAME 
STORY WE HAVE GOOD EMOTION NICE 
AND FIRM AND PLENTY OF IT THERE 
WERE STARS IN THE PAST THAT WAS 
PARTLY BUT THE CURRENT STARS ARE 
VERY STAID HE NEEDS FIRING UP 
SPARKLY HE NEEDS A NEW CHALLENGE 
THAT WILL MAKE HIM FLY HE HAS GOT 
SO MUCH ENERGY PENT UP THAT NEEDS 
REED DIRECTING REED DIRECTING 
ELAINE QUIGLEY READS PEOPLE LIKE A 
BOOK 
I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER BOOK JUDGE OR EVEN TRUST WHAT THOSE 
COMMENTATORS SAY AGAIN 
IN TERMS OF 
CHARACTER FROM THE SITUATION AT 
THE CRUCIBLE IT IS QUITE REVEALING 
FOR THE PUNDITS AND PLAYERS VERY VERY MUCH SO SHE WAS HAVING A CHAT TO 
US AND SHE WAS RIGHT ON THE BUTTON 
WITH MYSELF AND HAZEL YESTERDAY AS AS FAR AS DOING WAVES AND TREES AND 
HANDWRITING SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO 
BE SOLITARY AND A SNOOKER TABLE 
YOU HAVE TO BE IN YOUR OWN SPACE A 
LOT OF PENT UP EMOTION IT IS 
FASCINATING TO HEAR WHAT IS SAID 
YOU HAVE THE SNOOKER PLAYERS WHO 
ARE ONE OFFS IN THEIR OWN WORLD 
ANYWAY THE COMMENTATORS ARE ALL 
FROM SNOOKERS STOCK WE ARE ALL A 
BIT WEIRD IN OUR OWN WAY ANYWAY 
BUT IN BALLS IN A HOLE WITH A STICK 
IS A VERY STRANGE OCCUPATION 
PUTTING BALLS 
I WONDER IF PEOPLE 
WILL NOW BE MORE CONSCIOUS OF HOW 
THEY ARE WRITING 
THE AS LONG AS 
ELAINE IS NOT LOOKING WE WILL BE 
ALL RIGHT

THANK YOU THAT

STEWARDS INQUIRY HAD

HAVE THE PRESSURE OF SITTING IN THE 
BLACK CHAIR WITH THE CONDITIONS 
SHE DID NOT ASKING ONE QUESTION AT

THEY DID 
NOT IN MIND 
I WAS QUITE WORRIED 
ABOUT THINKING HOW MANY MATCHES YOU 
WOULD FORGET L. L. REMEMBER LOSING TO 
JOHN VIRGO IN THAT MATCH BY JOHN 
OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT REMEMBER IT AS 
MUCH I WAS ACTUALLY PLAYING I 
MISSED THE BALL WENT BACK TO 
SITTING IN THE CHAIR I PUT MY CUE 
ON TWO OTHER CHAIRS AUDIENCE 
CHAIRS AND AS HE WAS PLAYING A 
COUPLE OF SHOTS THE CUE ROLLED OFF 
AND MADE A CLATTERING NOISE L. 
THOUGHT I HAD PUT HIM OFF BUT IT 
DID NOT STICK IN JOHN'S MIND IT IT WAS THE ONLY TIME I WANTED MY 
OPPONENT TO CLEAR UP BECAUSE HE 
THOUGHT HE HAD PUT ME OFF HE SAID 
A PROPER SPORTING MASTERMIND WILL 
START ON B. B. C. TELEVISION IN JULY 
NOW TIME TO RESUME THE SEMI FINALS 
IN 
IN ACTION THIS AFTERNOON ALI 
CARTER PLAYING JOE PERRY FOUR MORE 
FRAMES TO PLAY THIS AFTERNOON ALI 
IS IN A STRONG POSITION SEVEN TO FIVE UP 
DENNIS TAYLOR AND CLIVE EVERTON IN 
THE 
COMMENTARY BOX GOOD EFFORT 
DENNIS NEVER MIND 
THE INTERMISSION SOMETIMES ALTERS 
THE COURSE OF THE MATCH JOE PERRY 
IS CERTAINLY HOPING THAT IS GOING 
TO BE THE CASE TODAY OF COURSE HE 
HAS GOT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN 
CARTER'S POT SUCCESS RATE WAS EIGHTY FOUR 
PER CENT AT THE START OF THE 
SESSION NOW IT IS NINETY 
TWO AND ONE HALF SESSIONS TO GO IN THIS MATCH 
I FORECAST A TIGHT FINISH IT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL CAN CHANGE THINGS 
AROUND IT DOES SO MANY TIMES 
THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD RETURN SAFETY 
SHOT 
BUT HE HAS LOST SEVEN OUT OF THE 
LAST NINE FRAMES 
IT IS ODD REALLY THE TIME I 
EXPECTED PERRY TO BEAT MOST 
VULNERABLE IN THIS MATCH IS WHEN HE 
PLAYED HIS BEST IN THE FIRST THREE 
FRAMES THAT CAME AFTER A DRAMATIC 
LATE NIGHT THIRTEEN TO TWELVE WIN OVER STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE 
HE HAS ONLY ONE AT TWO OF FRAMES IN 
TOTAL SINCE THEN HE HAS ONLY ONE 
TWO FRAMES 
HE CAN SEE THE THREE REDS TO THE 
RIGHT OF THE PINK BUT THAT IS SUCH 
DOUBLE A. THIN CONTACT TO GET BACK DOWN 
THE TABLE HE HAS GOT TO GET THIS 
JUST RIGHT PLAYED IT WELL 
MAYBE A FREE SHOT FOR JOE PERRY 
RED INTO THE RIGHT CORNER THERE IS 
A GAP AND THE BLACK IS A WAITING 
IF HE CAN KNOCK THIS IN 
I THINK THE REASON HE MISSED THE 
POT THERE YOU COULD SEE HOW MUCH 
RIGHT HAND SIDE HE HAD ON THE BALL 
TO AVOID THE CANNON 
IT IS AMAZING HOW MANY PEOPLE WHEN 
THEY STOP PLAYING THE GAME OF 
SNOOKER THEY THINK YOU HAVE TO PUT 
SIDE ON THE CUE BALL TO HELP THE 
POT AS SOON AS YOU APPLIED ANY 
SIDE THE POT IS MUCH MORE 
DIFFICULT 
HE HAD THAT TOO THICK HIT THAT 
TOO THICK STILL GOT A KEY GOOD 
CUE BALL 
WAS ALI LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY 
OF GOING ROUND THE BACK OF THIS 
RED IT IS NOT ON HE IS IN BIG TROUBLE HERE 
I THOUGHT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
ENOUGH ROOM TO GET IN BEHIND THE 
FIRST RED TO TAKE THE ONE NEAREST 
THE POCKET BUT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH 
THERE WHAT A CLEVER SHOT THAT WAS 
VERY WELL WORKED OUT 
I THINK HE 
THOUGHT HE MIGHT FLICK THIS RED 
AWAY ALSO HE JUST FLIPPED THAT RED 
IT WILL TAKE A GOOD SHOT TO GET ON 
A COLOUR HERE 
THAT WAS AMAZING HE POTTED THAT 
INTO 
THE RIGHT SIDE OF 
THERE IS TWO REDS TOGETHER HE 
CANNOT GET THROUGH TO THEM BUT 
THAT COULD BE MADE INTO A PLANT 
BUT HE WOULD HAVE TO KNOCK ONE RED 
ONTO IT AND HE CANNOT REALLY DO IT 
FROM THE POSITION HE'S FACED WITH 
AT THE MOMENT BUT THAT IS A 
DISTINCT POSSIBILITY NOW WE KNOW 
THAT THE PLANT IS AVAILABLE 
HE HAS PLAYED A LOT OF THOSE VERY 
THIN SAFETY'S VERY WELL 
HE MIGHT HAVE A LOOK AT THE PLANT 
AGAIN HE IS COMING AROUND THE 
TABLE POINTING THE TIP AT TWO REDS 
IF HE CAN SEE ENOUGH OF THE FIRST 
RED HE CAN MAKE IT HE HAS GOT TO 
PASS ANOTHER RED THOUGH BUT THERE 
IS A GAP BACK DOWN THE TABLE ALSO 
I THINK HE CAN MAKE THIS 
COULD HAVE TAKEN THE BROWN BUT 
WITH THE REDS WILL SPREAD A 
CERTAIN SNOOKER LEADING PERRY IND 
LOT OF TROUBLE LEADING PERRY IN 
LOT OF TROUBLE 
HE HAS HIT THE LEFT SIDE OF IT 
THAT IS NO GOOD 
IF HE IS STRAIGHT 
ON THIS THERE IS A POSSIBILITY HE 
COULD GET ON THE BLACK JUST 
DEPENDS ON THE ANGLE 
HE CAN SCREW BACK WITH A LITTLE BIT 
OF SIDE AND GIVE HIMSELF A CHANCE 
OF THE BLACK OR THE PINK HERE 
WATCH THE SIDE AS HE HITS THE 
CUSHION PLAYED IT TO PERFECTION 
WELL THAT IS A LITTLE BIT UNLUCKY 
IT MEANS HE CANNOT CONTROL THE CUE 
BALL NOW 
THAT WAS TERRIFIC NOW HE HAS GIVEN 
SUPERB CHANCE BUT A 
SCREW BACK THAT HE PLAYED ON THE 
RED HE HIT THIS WITH LOTS OF 
THAT IS WHERE 
HE'S AIMING 
WHEN IT 
HITS THE CUSHION IT SPINS TO THE 
LEFT AND JUST WATCH THE ANGLE 
YEARS OF PRACTICE 
WITHOUT THAT RIGHT HAND SIDE THE 
CUE BALL WOULD HAVE CANNONED THE 
BLACK 
HE IS CERTAINLY TAKEN CONTROL OF 
THIS SEMI FINAL AT THE MOMENT ALI 
CARTER JOE PERRY I THINK THE TENTH 
FRAME WHEN HE MADE THE BREAK OF FIFTY SEVEN 
AND LOOKED ALMOST CERTAIN TO TAKE 
IT IT IS NOT HIM FOR SIX A LITTLE 
BIT IT HAS KNOCKED HIM FOR SIX 
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT ALI CARTER HAS 
WORKED UP A HEAD OF STEAM 
ABOVE ALL PERRY MUST KEEP CLOSE TO 
CARTER SO THE PROBLEM OF CLINCHING 
THE MATCH WITH ONLY A FRAME WAS SO 
DESPAIR COMES INTO PLAY ONLY A 
FRAME OR SO TO SPARE IT IS EASY TO 
CLINCH THE MATCH WHEN YOU ARE 
SEVERAL FRAMES IN FRONT MAYBE MAYBE ANOTHER PLANT HERE 
YES HE CAN MAKE THAT AND STILL 
FINISH ON BLACK OR PINK 
HE IS STRIKING THE BALL BEAUTIFULLY 
AT THE MOMENT ALI CARTER HE IS 
GETTING THROUGH THE BALL NICELY AS 
WE SAY A LITTLE BIT LIKE A GOLF 
SWING WHEN YOU GET THROUGH THE 
BALL 
COULD SCREW BACK AND LEAVE THE RED 
INTO THE SAME POCKET 
ANOTHER RED AND COLOUR THEN THAT 
IS ALL CARTER NEEDS TO INCREASE HIS 
LEAD 
HE IS A BIT STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK 
BUT HE WILL NOT BOTHERED ABOUT THAT 
THE BLACK WILL BE ENOUGH TO PUT JOE 
PERRY IN A SPOT OF BOTHER 
HE WILL PLAY POSITION BUT HE 
CERTAINLY WILL NOT STRAIN FOR IT 
I THOUGHT MAYBE THE RED POTTED IN 
BETWEEN THE TWO REDS AND THE PINK 
BUT DOES IT 
A SIXTY FOUR BREAK WHICH NEW LEADS JOE 
PERRY NEEDING TWO FOUR POINT 
SNOOKERS 
HAD CARTER POTTED THAT PERRY WOULD 
PROBABLY HAVE CONCEDED 
ANY RED POTTED BY CARTER WOULD 
LEAVE PERRY NEEDING A FOUR SNOOKERS 
I THINK JOE WANTS TO CARRY ON AND 
TRY AND GET THE SNOOKERS BUT I 
THINK HE WANTS TO KNOCK ALI CARTER 
OUT OF HIS STRIDE 
HE IS THE ONE THAT IS FLOWING AND 
JOE HAS NOT BEEN GETTING MUCH TABLE 
TIME THAT IS A NICE POSITION FOR 
THE FOUR REDS TO BE 
THIS TO PUT THE ISSUE BEYOND 
REASONABLE DOUBT 
AND SO MORE TROUBLE FOR JOE PERRY 
AS ALI CARTER GOES THREE FRAMES 
CLEAR 
CARTER IS IN A WINNING STREAK HE 
HAS BEEN PRETTY FLUENT IN THE LAST 
FEW FRAMES ONCE HE HAS GOT AN 
OPPORTUNITY HE HAS ACCOUNTED FOR 
THE LAST THREE FRAMES BASICALLY IN 
FOUR SCORING VISIT VISITS SO HE 
HAS GOT PERRY AND A LOT OF PRESSURE 
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT EIGHT 
FRAMES OUT OF TEN HE HAS WON THAT 
IS QUITE SOMETHING AND THAT REALLY 
DOES BOOST YOUR CONFIDENCE BUT JOE 
PERRY HAS TO FORGET ABOUT ALL THAT 
HAS GONE ON THIS AFTERNOON AND TRY 
AND JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE NEXT 
FEW FRAMES HE HAS REALLY GOT TO 
TRY AND GET BACK ON TRACK OR HE 
CAN SEE THIS SEMI FINAL SLIPPING 
AWAY FROM HIM STILL A LONG WAY TO GO THOUGH 
THE FIRST TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN WINS ALTHOUGH CARTER 
HAS NOT GOT HALFWAY YET THE 
FIRST TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN WINS 
A VERY DIFFERENT CHALLENGE A LONG 
MATCH LIKE THIS 
JOE JUST HAS TO FORGET ABOUT WHAT 
HAS HAPPENED AND START UP FROM 
HERE THAT IS THE WAY YOU HAVE GOT 
TO THINK 
PERRY HAS GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO 
SHAKE CARTER BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT 
CARTER IS VERY CONFIDENT 
PRETTY WELL EVERYTHING IS GOING HIS 
WAY 
HIS SAFETY PLAY IS GOING TO HAVE TO 
BE ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON TO TRY AND 
FORCE ALI CARTER INTO GIVING HIM A 
CHANCE 
THAT IS THE FAMOUS CLIFF THORBURN 
DUMP SHOT DUMP THE RED AT THE 
OTHER END OF THE TABLE 
TO PREVENT 
THE SAFETY TO THE BAULK CUSHION 
UNLESS YOU MOVE THE RED 
WOULD YOU CALL THAT A REVERSE DUMP 
SHOT 
GOT TO BE CAREFUL HE GETS THIS ONE 
RIGHT 
THE ONLY PROBLEM IF HE TOOK THE 
CUT ON HE WOULD BE CANNONING INTO 
THE RED TO THE LEFT OF IT BUT HE 
IS NOW COMING ROUND TO HAVE LOOK AT THE ANGLE 
MAYBE JUST A SAFETY INSTEAD OF 
TRYING TO SNICK IT IN HE IS TOO 
RISKY HE HAS PLAYED DOES SO WELL 
IN THIS SESSION PLAYED THOSE SO 
WELL MIGHT HAVE A FREE SHOT THIS TIME 
ALI CAN CUT THIS RED IN AND GO 
ROUND THE BACK OF THE BLACK 
THAT IS FAR TOO PACY A LITTLE BIT 
OF TENSION THERE TOO OVERHEATED BY 
THAT MUCH HE MIGHT JUST HAVE 
COVERED EVERYTHING THINK HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT 
AND THE OTHER SIDE I THINK THAT IS 
TOUGH THE FACT THAT THE BLACK IS 
NOT AVAILABLE IT WASN'T EASY MAYBE NOT 
YOU WANT SOMETHING EASIER THAN THIS 
AS STARTER WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN 
KEPT OFF THE TABLE SO LONG BUT 
WELL PLAYED GOOD CUEING THERE 
YES IT WAS PERRY HAVING TOTALLED 
ONLY SIXTEEN POINTS AND THE LAST THREE 
FRAMES HAS GOT TO MAKE THAT LEAD 
TO SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL 
MIGHT JUST BE ABLE TO GET ONTO THE 
BLACK HERE THE BLACK IS JUST 
AVAILABLE INTO THE RIGHT CORNER 
HE WAS NEARLY A LITTLE BIT CARELESS 
WITH THAT THAT HIT THE JAWS 
WHICH MEANS HE HASN'T FINISHED ON 
THE BLACK AS HE INTENDED HE CANNOT 
QUITE HOLD FOR THE RED NEXT TO THE 
BLACK NOW 
HE WILL HAVE TO PLAY A CANNON AND 
THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT AS GOOD AS 
THE SHOT HE COULD HAVE BEEN PLAYING 
THE RED WENT RIGHT OVER THE POCKET 
HE IS STRUGGLING A BIT AT THE 
MOMENT JOE PERRY THAT WAS ALL 
CAUSED BY THE BLACK HE WOBBLED IT 
DID GOING BUT IT DID NOT GET ON ITS 
INTENDED RED 
ALI CARTER IS BACK AT THE TABLE A 
LOT QUICKER THAN HE THOUGHT HE 
WOULD BE 
THAT COULD HAVE GONE ASTRAY HE DID 
NOT WANT TO CANNON THE RED HE 
WANTED TO FIND THE 
GAP AND 
THEN HE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT HE HAS GOT 
A LONG ONE UP INTO THE CORNER 
POCKET IT IS TRICKY THE CUT BACK 
INTO THE CORNER IS JUST AS 
DIFFICULT 
HE HAS CANNONED THE REDS BUT HE HAS 
GOT THE POT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
TAKE THE YELLOW ONE HE WON NOT BE 
HAMPERED THE REDS ARE OVER THE 
POCKETS HE WILL NOT HE HAS GOT 
TO HAVE A GO AT THE YELLOW 
NOT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR CUT BUT 
CERTAINLY A POSSIBLE FRAME WINNING 
CHANCE 
HE HAS A COMPACT CUE ACTION HE IS 
NOT THE TALLEST OF PLAYERS BUT 
EVERYTHING LOOKS SO COMFORTABLE 
HIS STANCE IT LOOKS NOT UNLIKE THE 
GREAT 
JOE DAVIS JOE HAD A VERY PRONOUNCED LEFT ICE DANCE 
HE HAD ONE FOR A FORWARD TO DANCE THE OTHER FOOT 
MOST OF THE TOP PLAYERS ARE BURIED 
SQUARE ON COMPARED TO THE OLD 
PLAYERS MARY VERY MORE REDS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED 
FOR A FEW YEARS CARTER HAS BEEN A 
GOOD ENOUGH PLAYER TO WIN SOMETHING 
HE HAS JUST LACKED THE FINE EDGE OF 
SELF BELIEF 
HOW WILLIE HE BE IF HE GETS CLOSE 
TO THE WINNING POST WILL HE BE 
IF HE IS SEVERAL FRAMES IN FRONT 
IT WILL BE LOT EASIER THAN IF HE IS ONLY ONE OR TWO AHEAD 
HE HAD A BIT OF A SETBACK IN TWO THOUSAND THREE HE HAD CROHN'S DISEASE AND HAD TO 
HAVE HOSPITAL TREATMENT 
HE STILL 
HAS TO WATCH HIMSELF AS A RESULT OF 
THAT HE HAD AN OPERATION IT WAS 
MORE SERIOUS THAN HE REALISED AT 
THE TIME 
HE DID NOT MEAN TO STENA EIGHT HE 
HIT THE WHITE IN THE MIDDLE 
STUN 
HIT THE WHITE IN THE MIDDLE STUN IT 
HE HAS BEEN TRYING TOO HARD THAT THAT IS WHERE HE SHOULD HAVE FINISHED 
IT IS ALL CHANGE 
HE IS JUST THINKING ABOUT WHETHER 
TO TAKE THE BLACK PAWN OR NOT ON 
IT IS ONE OF THOSE WHERE YOU NEVER 
PUT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT INTO THE POT THIS IS A 
TOUGH ONE THAT JEREZ FACED WITH 
CARTER PLAYED THE POT JOE IS 
HE COULD STILL SNATCH THE FRAME IT 
IS A PITY FOR HIM THERE HE GOT A 
KICK ON 
THE RED 
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
ON THE PINK AT A DIFFERENT ANGLE 
LET'S HAVE LOOK AT THESE THE 
WHITE TURNED RIGHT IN THE AIR AT 
LEAST THE RED WENT IN HOW DOES HE 
GET TO THE TWO DIFFICULT REDS HE 
MIGHT NOT EVEN BOTHER POTTING THE 
RAP THE BLACK HE IS MAKING SURE HE GETS A SNOOKER 
BUT FOR THE KICK HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN ON THE PINK AT AN ANGLE WHICH 
WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO DEVELOP 
THE TWO REMAINING REDS 
HE DOES NOT 
WANT TOO MUCH PACE ON THIS 
NOT QUITE IT COULD BE A FREE BALL 
IT COULD POSSIBLY BE A FREE BALL 
IT IS 
YES FREEPORT AWARDED WHEN 
THEN ON OFFENDER CANNOT HIT BOTH 
EDGES OF THE BALL ON FREE BALL 
THE BLACK HAS BEEN NOMINATED AS THE 
EXTRA RED 
NOT A GOOD SHOT HE HAS 
GOT TO TAKE ANOTHER COLOUR THERE 
IS NO ANGLE WHEN POTTING THE GREEN 
TO GET TO THE REDS IF THE BLUE 
GOES HE COULD DO IT FROM THE BLUE 
IT WOULD REQUIRE A VERY GOOD SHOT 
INDEED 
I AM NOT SURE WHAT HE PLAYED IN THE 
END 
NOT THE BEST OF SAFETIES CARTER 
COMES TO THE TABLE SEVENTEEN IN FRONT 
POTTABLE RED CHANCE TO CLINCH THE 
FRAME TO GO NINE TO FIVE UP NOT THE BEST POSITIONAL SHOT 
CARTER NEEDED ONLY A RED AND A 
COLOUR AFTER HE POTTED THE BLACK 
HE SHOULD HAVE LEFT HIMSELF 
SOMETHING EASIER 
HE HAS GOT SECOND PRIZE IT WAS A 
PRETTY CLEVER SHOT IF HE MANAGED 
TO POT THE RED HE ROLLED UP TIGHT 
BEHIND THE BLACK 
IT WAS A GREAT CHANCE TO CLINCH THE 
FRAME BEFORE HE LOST POSITION 
CARTER STILL NEEDS ONLY A RED AND 
COLOUR THAT WOULD INCREASE HIS 
LEAD TO TO NINETY FIVE NINETY FIVE NINE TO FIVE 
NOT THAT EASY HAVING TO STRIKE DOWN 
WINDS 
THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD RUN WINDS OF THE BALL DOWN WARDS HE HAS 
APOLOGISED FOR THAT BIT OF GOOD 
FORTUNE 
HE WAS VERY GLAD OF IT L. FORTUNE I CALLED HIM ALLISTER A COUPLE OF 
YEARS AGO HIS NAME IS ALLISTER BUT 
EVERYONE CALLS HIM ALI HE PREFERS ALI HE HAS LEFT THE RED ON 
CAN JOE PERRY HOLD HIMSELF TOGETHER 
TO CLEAR THESE CAN HE POT THE 
YELLOW AND HOLD FOR THE YELLOW 
AGAIN IT WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK 
ON ITS SPOT IT MIGHT BE 
HE HAS HAD TO BAN AWAY SOMEWHAT IF 
HE IS DEAD STRAIGHT ON THIS IT 
NEEDS GOOD CUEING RUN 
LOOK WHERE HE WAS STRIKING DOWN ON 
THE CUE BALL NOT QUITE HE HAS GOT 
A CHANCE HE HAS GOT TO TAKE IT TO 
THE MIDDLE POCKET OFF THIS BACK 
CUSHION 
NO NO HE CONCENTRATED SO MUCH ON 
THE WHITE HE REALLY IS FEELING THE 
PRESSURE OUT THAT THERE 
SO CARTER NEEDS ONLY ONE OF THE 
FIVE REMAINING COLOURS TO SECURE 
THE FRAME 
WHAT IS THE PACE LIKE HAS HE GOT 
THE SNOOKER HE HAS 
NO MATTER HOW LONG HE WILL LOOK AT 
THIS TYPE OF SHOT YOU HAVE GOT TO 
TRY TO GET OUT OF THE SNOOKER AND 
HOPE YOU CAN GET IT SAFE YOU NEVER 
KNOW WHERE THEY ARE GOING 
THIS IS A CHANCE FOR PERRY HE 
NEEDS ALL THE COLOURS 
HE IS GOING TO NEED THE EXTENSION 
ON HIS CUE L. L. THINK HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SCREW THIS BACK 
THAT WAS A BIG SHOT FOR JOE PERRY 
IT WAS NOT HARD ENOUGH HE DID NOT 
GET INTO IT HE DID NOT GET THE 
REQUIRED SCREW 
IT WOULD NOT BE ALL 
THAT BAD IF HE ONLY NEEDED THE PINK 
HE ALSO NEEDS TO GET ON THE BLACK 
I DO NOT KNOW IF THE ANGLE IS THERE 
IT WOULD NEED SOME SHOT TO POT THE 
PINK AND COME OFF THE LEFT SIDE 
CUSHION I 
DO NOT THINK THE SHOT IS 
ON WHAT A SHOT THIS IS FROM 
JOE PERRY OWN JOE PERRY ENDS HIS SIX FRAME LOSING 
STREAK THEREBY REDUCING ALI 
CARTER'S LEAD 
WITH DENNIS TAYLOR IN THE 
COMMENTARY BOX WE HAVE HAD ANY E. 
MAIL ABOUT YOU ALWAYS MENTIONING BE 
NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE FINAL IT IS FROM STEVE IN 
ROMFORD THIS IS HIS SUGGESTION OF 
FOR YOU A EXTERMINATE 
WAS THAT ME 
OR HIM HE WANTS TO EXTERMINATE OH 
DEAR 
THAT IS JOE PERRY STOPPING DEAR THE ROT ISN'T IT 
IT HAD STARTED 
TO LOOK LIKE WORRYING TIMES WAS DUG 
IT DID NOT LOOK LIKE HE'S CUEING 
WAS TO BRILLIANT WORRYING TIMES 
YOU'RE MUTTERING THROUGHOUT THE 
FRAME BUT THIS WAS DANGEROUS 
SITUATION FOR JOE YOU WERE 
MATTERING MATTERING HE DOES NOT 
WANT TO GET TOO FAR BEHIND IT IS 
FANTASTIC PINK AND BLACK WHAT 
ABOUT THE TWISTS AND TURNS 
EVEN IF 
A PLAYER LOOKS LIKE HE IS ON THE 
ROPES BLACK JOE PERRY DATE IT 
STILL REQUIRES THE OTHER GUIDE TO 
KEEP HIM UNDER PRESSURE DEED 
THAT IS EFFECTIVELY WHAT HAPPENED 
ALI CARTER WAS SHAKING HIS HEAD HE 
LET THE OTHER GUY A BACKING WHEN HE 
WAS STRUGGLING YOU'D DO SENSE BY 
THE SHOTS HE IS PLAYING AND HIS 
BODY LANGUAGE YOU DO ALI CARTER 
WILL BE FRUSTRATED OVERALL HE HAS 
HIS NOSE IN FRONT 
YOU SAID HE IS 
GOING TO POT THE BLACK AND MUCH OUT 
AT THE CRUCIBLE 
A GREAT PINK AND 
BLACK YOU COMPOSE IS SAD AND LET 
YOUR OPPONENT HAVE A THINK ABOUT 
THE MISTAKE HE HAS MADE COMPOSE 
YOURSELF 
JUST AS THE MATCH YOURSELF APPEARED TO BE RUNNING AWAY FROM 
PERRY HE COULD COME IF HE WON THE 
TWO REMAINING FRAMES BE LEVEL 
OVERNIGHT 
AT THE END OF THE FRAME I THINK 
STEVE DAVIS PICKED UP ON IT THIS 
WAS ALIOU AS JOE WALKED OUT OF THE 
ARENA THAT SHAKE OF THE HEAD SAID 
I HAVE MISSED A TRICK ALI CARTER IT WAS A FREE SHOT FOR JOE 
A ROUND OF APPLAUSE BUT THERE IS A 
POT AVAILABLE INTO THE RIGHT CORNER 
LET'S SEE IF THE LAST FRAME HAS 
RESTORED THE CONFIDENCE OF JOE 
PERRY IT IS NOT EASY TO GET ON TO 
RECOVER A COLOUR 
THAT IS THE POT HE IS LOOKING OUT 
THERE IS GAP HE MAY BE ABLE TO 
SCREW BETWEEN AT HE HAS GOT BIG 
GAP HE GOT THE MAIN PART OF THE 
SHOT 
THAT WAS PLAYED TO PERFECTION HE 
LOOKS MUCH MORE CONFIDENT 
IT IS AMAZING HOW THAT FRAME CAN 
CHANGE THINGS 
STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK IS O. K. HE CAN 
SCREW BACK 
LOOK AT THAT IT CAME OFF THE 
CUSHION WE WERE SAYING IT WAS 
GOING SO WELL AND THEN YOU GET 
BOUNCE LIKE THAT 
THAT IS THE FIRST 
WE HAVE HAD AS NOTICEABLE AS THAT 
THIS AFTERNOON IT IS A VERY 
UNFORTUNATE TIME FOR PERRY HE HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RETRIEVE THE 
SITUATION THIS RED INTO THE MIDDLE 
POCKET I THINK HE CAN TAKE IT ON 
AND LEAVE HIMSELF ON THE BLACK 
IT WAS ALMOST STRAIGHT HE WAS 
OPAQUE IN THE END O. K. 
WHERE IS THE PINK GOING TO GO IF 
THERE IS ROOM BETWEEN THE TWO REDS 
HE MIGHT BE SNOOKERED ON THIS ONE 
THERE IS ROOM ENOUGH FOR IT TO 
ON ITS OWN SPOT IT IS MAKING IT 
AWKWARD STRIKING 
HE SHOWED WHAT CAN ATTACK AND 
BOTTLE HE HAD WHEN HE CAME BACK AND 
BEAT STEPHEN MCCORMACK IN THE FINAL 
FRAME SHOOT OUT STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
THAT WAS TERRIFIC WIN THIRTEEN TO TWELVE OVER 
A PLAYER WHO IS GOING TO FINISH 
SECOND IN DEEP END OF SEASON 
RANKINGS THE END 
HE COULD HAVE DONE WITH A FEW MORE 
INCHES OF PACE NOW OF THE STUN RUN THROUGH SHOT 
NOW THE STUN HE WAS ABLE TO COME 
OFF THE CUSHION 
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE HE IS 
ALMOST OVER THE WINNING LINE 
ANOTHER TURN AROUND IN THIS SEMI 
FINAL 
OWN 
HIS HIGHEST BREAK IN THE MATCH HAS 
BEEN A BREAK OF EIGHTY FOUR IN FRAME SIX VERY WELL DEVELOPED 
HE IS O. K. 
THAT IS ANOTHER SUPER 
SHOT O. K. THE FRAME IS OVER BUT HE 
Q. HE QUEUED THAT BEAUTIFULLY 
HE CUE THAT BEAUTIFULLY 
THIS WILL 
BE PERRY'S FIFTH CENTURY OF THE 
TOURNAMENT FIFTY SEVENTH IN ALL THE ALL 
TIME RECORD IS SIXTY EIGHT IN THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
THE A. T. F. OF HIS CAREER A. T. F. NO 
EIGHTY CARTER LOOKS VERY RUEFUL HE 
MISSED THE BOAT IN THE LAST FRAME 
WHICH PERRY SNATCHED BRILLIANTLY 
PERRIER HAS USED THAT TIED TURNER 
TO MAKE THIS EXCELLENT CENTURY 
HENRY PERRY 
THIS SEMI FINAL IS REALLY BACK ON 
AGAIN JOHN PARROTT SAID HE COULD 
NOT PICK A WINNER THAT IS THE CASE 
AGAIN HE IS CLOSING THE GAP IT 
LOOK LIKE IT WAS GOING TO OPEN TO 
THREE FRAMES BUT IT LOOKED LIKE 
FOOD FOR THOUGHT FOR CARTER THAT 
A SPLENDID 
BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN FROM PERRY 
REDUCES PERRY'S DEFICIT 
THAT WAS A VERY WELL CONTROLLED 
BREAK BUT ONE UNEXPECTED PROBLEM 
DID COME PERRY'S WAY 
YES HE WAS 
PLAYING TO ITS SCREW BACK AND LEAVE 
A CHOICE OF REDS HE THOUGHT IT WAS 
GOING TO BE O. K. BUT WATCH THE WHITE 
JOE THROUGH HIS HAND OUT HE COULD 
NOT BELIEVE IT WITHOUT THE BOUNCE 
HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE FINISHED 
SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE AND HAD A 
CHOICE OF REDS IN THE END HE HAD 
THIS AWKWARD BRIDGING BUT HE 
FINISHED STRAIGHT AND HE COULD GO 
FOR THE BRIDGE PINK THE BAD 
BOUNCE DID NOT PENALISE HIM TOO 
MUCH 
SO THE GAP IS NOW ONLY ONE MUCH FRAME PERRY IS STARTING TO FANCY 
HIS CHANCE OF STARTING THE 
PENULTIMATE SESSION TOMORROW 
MORNING LEVEL AT EIGHT TO WAIT EIGHT TO EIGHT THE 
HE DID NOT INTEND TO DOUBLE THE 
RATE THAT FAR BACK UP DOUBLE THE 
RED 
YES THAT WAS A STRANGE ONE RED FROM JOE TO HIT IT THAT HARD HE 
MIGHT HAVE TO PUT A LITTLE TRACE OF 
SIDE ON IT 
IF HE FINISHES THE RIGHT SIDE OF 
THE BLUE THAT IS EVEN BETTER 
BECAUSE HE CAN GO INTO THE PINK 
FULL BALL NOW A KEY SHOT COMING UP 
AS LONG AS THE RED IS NOT COVERED 
WITH THE BLUE WHEN THE BLUE IS RE 
SPOTTED IS THE UNLUCKY IS HE 
UNLUCKY HE IS WALKING AROUND THE 
TABLE BRISKLY SO MAYBE HE CAN SEE 
ENOUGH OF IT AND HE CAN HE MIGHT 
JUST BE ABLE IF HE DROPS IT IN 
HE HAS A CHANCE ON THE BLUE HE 
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET TO THE BLACK 
THIS WAS HOW PERRY LET CARTER IN 
HE HIT THE RED HARDER THAN INTENDED 
BUT FOR THE KISS HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN CLOSER TO THIS RED 
IS HE 
GOING TO BE FULLY COMMITTED THERE 
IS A POSSIBLE POT ON AND HE CAN 
STUN A ROUND THE BACK OF THE BLACK 
IF HE HITS IT HARDER HE WILL HEAD 
UP THE TABLE 
HE STRUCK THE OTHER RED BUT HE IS 
O. K. IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE POT O. K. 
TO FLICK THE RED LIKE THAT AND 
FINISH ON THE BLACK A BIT OF GOOD 
FORTUNE BUT HE DESERVED IT AFTER 
THE POT 
THAT WAS A BIT UNLUCKY HE PLAYED 
THE CANNON WELL AND HE GOT THE 
WHITE TO STOP THERE BUT EVERYTHING 
IS A LITTLE AWKWARD THERE LOOKS TO 
BE ONE THAT WOULD CUT BACK INTO THE 
RIGHT CORNER HE WILL NEED THE REST 
TO DO IT BY BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED LOOKING PRETTY GOOD NOW 
WELL EVEN THOUGH HE LOST THE LAST 
TWO FRAMES IF HE COULD CONVERT 
THIS CHANCE AND TAKE THE LAST FRAME 
OF THE SESSION HE WOULD BE MORE 
THAN PLEASED IT WOULD MEAN THAT HE 
WON THE SESSION SIX TO TWO AFTER LOSING 
THE OPENING SESSION FIVE TO THREE THAT IS A 
PRETTY GOOD PERFORMANCE 
JUST LOOKING AT THE BUNCH I AM NOT 
SURE IF THE TWO REDS NEAR THE PINK 
SPOT ARE AVAILABLE IN TO THE LEFT 
CORNER THEY SEEM TO BE COVERING 
EACH OTHER INTO THE RIGHT CORNER 
THE WHITE SOMEWHERE NEAR THE PINK 
WOULD NOT BE BAD HERE IF THOSE REDS 
GO THEY MUST DO HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL 
THE CANNON HAS HELD THEM ON THE 
PINK 
A PRETTY HIGH STANDARD IN THIS 
SESSION HIS POT SUCCESS RATE HAS 
GONE UP SIX PER CENT 
ALI HAS HAD A CENTURY BREAK HE HAS 
HAD A FIFTY SIX SIXTY FOUR FIFTY ONE TWO FIFTY ONES JOE 
PERRY 
HAS HAD A ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN AND FIFTY SEVEN THERE THERE HAS BEEN A FIFTY BREAK IN EVERY FRAME EXCEPT ONE THIS AFTERNOON 
ANOTHER RED IS POTABLE TO THE SAME 
CORNER 
EVERY CREDIT TO THESE TWO PLAYERS 
THEIR FIRST TIME HERE AT THE 
CRUCIBLE THEATRE IN THE SEMI FINAL 
IT IS GOING TO GET MORE AND MORE 
INTERESTING WITH EACH FRAME 
THAT WAS A SIMPLE FRAME BALL FOR 
CARTER 
PERRY LEAD FIVE TO TWO BUT CARTER CARTER WINNING THE LAST FRAME LAST EVENING 
AND THE FIRST FIVE THIS AFTERNOON 
WENT EIGHT TO FIVE UP 
I CAN'T WAIT FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S 
SESSION CLIVE CAN JOE PERRY GET 
CARTER DO YOU THINK 
HE HAS CERTAINLY GIVEN HIMSELF A 
BETTER CHANCE HE HAS REDUCED THE 
DEFICIT TO EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHT TO SEVEN 
IF THE REDS GO HE CAN SLIP PASS 
THEM ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE 
TABLE BATCH PASSED TO THEM 
PASSED THEM 
THIS HAS BEEN A TERRIFIC EFFORT 
FROM ALI CARTER 
THE EIRIAN WILLIAMS HAVING TO RUN 
AROUND THE TABLE AT THE MOMENT 
THE SECOND CENTURY OF THE SESSION 
HIS SECOND CENTURY HE MADE ONE HUNDRED SIX 
TO GO SEVEN TO FIVE UP 
IN THE LAST FRAME JOE PERRY MADE A 
BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN IT IS AMAZING WHAT 
YOU CAN DO WHEN THE FRAME RESULT IS 
NO LONGER IN DOUBT 
YES BUT THESE 
BOYS FOR AN EXHIBITION AND THIS IS 
THE SORT OF STUFF YOU WILL SEE 
BOOK THESE BOYS THAT WAS ANOTHER 
EXHIBITION SHOT 
ALI CARTER ENDS THE SESSION WITH A 
TOTAL 
ALI CARTER ENDS THE SESSION WITH A TOTAL CLEARANCE OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT AND LEEDS 
JOE PERRY NINE TO SEVEN HE LEADS JOE PERRY 
THAT WAS THE FIFTY EIGHTH CENTURY TEN MORE 
FOR THE RECORD WELL PLAYED BOTH 
PLAYERS THAT WAS GREAT 
FOR A 
LITTLE WHILE IT LOOKED A LITTLE 
UNDER SPECK COMPARED TO THE 
O'SULLIVAN AND HENDRY MATCH BUT IT 
HAS TAKEN OFF A BUS STOP IF YOU 
HAVE JUST TUNED IN YOU CAN SEE WHY 
THESE TWO ARE IN THE SEMI FINAL 
THEY HAVE BOTH HAD DIFFICULTIES TO 
OVERCOME AND MANAGED TO DO IT IT IT WAS LOOKING LIKE AN ALL RIGHT 
SESSION FOR ALI CARTER BECAUSE OF 
THAT ONE HUNDRED BRAKE HE HAS WON THE 
SESSION SIX TO TWO AND HE WILL BE 
DELIGHTED 
IT IS LIKE SOMEBODY HAS DELIGHTED FLICKED A SWITCH ON SOMEBODY'S 
PERFORMANCE SOMETIMES 
OFTEN WE SEE 
BOTH PLAYERS DRAGGING EACH OTHER 
DOWN ALL OF A SUDDEN ONE BLOKE 
MAKES A CENTURY AND THE OTHER GUY 
RESPONSE THEY ARE VERY MUCH LIKE 
PRIZEFIGHTERS SOMETIMES 
IT WAS 
UNDERSTANDABLY EDGY AT CERTAIN 
TIMES WOULD YOU AGREE THEY ARE NOW 
SETTLING INTO IT AND BRINGING THE 
BEST OUT OF EACH OTHER 
VERY MUCH 
SIDE COME FROM THIS FIRST SESSION 
ALI CARTER IS A DIFFERENT PLAYER 
HE LOOKS COMFORTABLE OUT THERE AND 
THAT WAS A MAGNIFICENT RESPONSE 
SELF BELIEF WAS SOMETHING YOU 
TALKED ABOUT THIS MORNING THEY 
HAVE BOTH SHOWN SO FAR THEY CAN 
HAVE DIFFICULT PERIODS BUT THEY 
CAN GET BACK TO THEIR 
BEST 
BOTH OF 
BOTH OF THEM KNOW THEY CAN COMPETE ON A 
CENTRE TABLE THEY WILL NOW BE 
GOING BACK REFLECTING ON WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED IT WILL BE WHOEVER 
DECIDES THEY CAN WIN IT WHO HAS 
GOT THE MOST BELIEF 
VERY DIFFICULT 
TO CALL 
I THOUGHT IT WAS AT THE 
BEGINNING AND I STILL THINK SO 
THROUGHOUT THIS CHAMPIONSHIP WE 
HAVE HEARD FROM A VARIETY OF PEOPLE 
ASKING THEM THEIR THOUGHTS AND 
OPINIONS TODAY IT IS DAME KELLY 
HOLMES 
MY NAN AND GRANDDAD ALWAYS WATCHED 
SNOOKER AND I ALWAYS USED TO GO 
ROUND THE HOUSE IN THE EVENINGS AT 
WEEKENDS WITHOUT DOUBT THERE 
WOULD BE SNOOKER ON T. V. THAT WAS 
ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO I WAS REALLY 
LITTLE IT IS THE SAME NOW WHEN I 
GO ROUND THEIR HOUSE THEY WILL BE 
GLUED TO THE SET HE WOULD BE MADE 
UP TO COME HERE 
UP TO COME HERE 
ABSOLUTELY HAVING BEEN AN ATHLETE 
COMPETING AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL 
PEOPLE THINK YOU ARE PREPARED FOR 
ANYTHING YOU GET TO THE OLYMPICS 
AND YOU HAVE DONE IT AND YOU ARE 
NOT NERVOUS ANY MORE BELIEVE ME 
YOU ARE SO FOCUSED ON WHAT YOU WANT 
TO DO BUT ULTIMATELY THERE IS THAT 
UNKNOWN AHEAD OF YOU EVEN THOUGH 
YOU HAVE PRACTICE AND GONE THROUGH 
IT AND COMPETED SO MANY TIMES WHEN 
IT COMES TO SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT 
TO YOU THERE IS NO TURNING BACK 
WALKING DOWN THOSE STAIRS IS 
PROBABLY BIT OF ADRENALIN 
EXCITEMENT NERVES BUT ULTIMATELY 
THEY KNOW IT WILL BE AN UTCOME THEY HAVE WANTED ALL THEIR LIFE 
ALL SPORT IS SO DIFFERENT BEING AN 
ATHLETE YOU CANNOT CONTROL WHAT 
THE OTHER ATHLETES DO YOU HAVE 
YOUR GAME PLAN YOU ARE IN BED EIGHT HUNDRED 
METRES RACE WITH SEVEN OTHER PEOPLE 
IN SNOOKER YOU HAVE THE OPPOSITION 
IN THE SET OF BALLS THEY ARE YOUR 
OPPOSITION YOU CANNOT CONTROL THEM 
ALL THE TIME YOU HOPE YOU HAVE 
YOUR TACTICS RIGHT BUT YOU NEVER 
KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN A SNOOKER 
PLAYER CAN SIT THERE AND KNOW IT IS 
OUT OF THEIR HANDS AND IT MUST BE 
HARD TO TAKE YOU ARE ONLY IN 
CONTROL WHEN YOU ARE ON THE TABLE 
IT IS MENTAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL 
PRACTICAL BATTLES 
WHY L. WOULD 
HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
BIG BREAKS GIRL 
I LIKE THE TACTICS 
SIDE OF IT MY FORTE WAS TACTICS IN 
RUNNING L. DID NOT ALWAYS LEAD FROM 
THE FRONT I CAME FROM THE BACK 
TACTICS TACTICS JUST BEFORE WE GO WE HAVE TIME TO 
LOOK BACK AT MATCH PLAYED HERE THIRTY 
YEARS AGO IT FEATURES LEGENDARY 
FIGURE IN THE HISTORY OF SNOOKER 
FRED DAVIS 
HE WAS SUCH A GENTLEMAN 
HE KNEW EVERY MOVE POSSIBLE ON THE 
SNOOKER TABLE 
HIS SENSE OF HUMOUR 
WAS SUPERB 
SOMEBODY EVERY PLAYER 
ASPIRED TO BE 
HE WAS THE ULTIMATE 
PROFESSIONAL 
HE WAS A REAL PROFESSIONAL SWEETHEART HE WILL BE REMEMBERED SWEETHEART AS THE SWEETHEART CHEEKY SMILING CHAP HE USED 
TO IRRITATE JOE A GREAT DEAL HE 
THOUGHT WHILST HE WAS SMILING HE 
WAS NOT CONCENTRATING 
FRED LIVED A 
LITTLE BIT IN THE SHADOW OF JOE 
BUT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT KNEW 
AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT THE GAME UP 
RECKONED THAT FRED MIGHT EVEN HAVE 
BEEN A BETTER PLAYER THAN JOE 
PEOPLE ALWAYS MAKE UNFAIR 
COMPARISONS FRED WAS A GREAT 
PLAYER IN HIS OWN RIGHT HEAT WON 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS ON EIGHT 
OCCASIONS 
HIS FAVOURITE TROPHY WAS OCCASIONS THE VERY FIRST TROPHY HE WON WHICH 
WAS THE BOY'S PROFESSIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIP HE WON IT FOR THE 
FIRST TIME AS A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD HE WON 
IT ON A NUMBER OF OTHER OCCASIONS 
THAT WAS THE ONE TROPHY HE PRIZED 
ABOVE ALL 
FRED DID NOT PRACTISE 
THAT MUCH BUT HAD THAT SHORT CUE 
ACTION ALWAYS SMILING AS HE HAD 
HIS FOOT ON YOUR THROAT 
IN HIS 
EARLY CAREER FRED COULD NOT BE 
BOTHERED TO PRACTISE HE WENT TO A 
TOURNAMENT IN AUSTRALIA IN NINETEEN SIXTY 
NEVER HIT A BALL UNTIL THE 
TOURNAMENT STARTED HE DULY 
DEMOLISHED EVERYBODY 
WHAT A TOUGH 
COMPETITOR ON THE SNOOKER TABLE HE 
USED TO HAVE A LITTLE MANNERISM 
YOU WOULD BE SITTING IN YOUR CHAIR 
AND HE WOULD PLAY INTO THE REDS 
SPIN ROUND AND LAUGHTER THE CROWD 
THEN HE WOULD GET DOWN AND LOOK AT 
HIS SHOT YOU WOULD THINK YOU HAVE 
A CHANCE HE HAD RUN OUT OF 
POSITION HE WOULD LOOK AT A BALL 
AND YOU WOULD THINK THERE WAS NO 
WAY IT WOULD GO AND THEN FRED 
WOULD GET DOWN AND STROKED THE BALL 
INTO THE POCKET AND THE CROWD WOULD 
APPLAUD YOU USED TO THINK YOU 
OLD DEVIL YOU DID THAT ON 
PURPOSE 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HE REACHED THE SEMI FINALS 
WHICH WAS THE LAST TIME HE ACTUALLY 
GOT THAT FAR IN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS IT WAS NOT BAD FOR 
SOMEBODY AT THE AGE OF SIXTY FOUR 
THE SHOT 
I ALWAYS REMEMBER HE PLAYED PERRIE 
MANS IN THE SEMI FINAL HE WAS 
CLEARING UP TO WIN THIS FRAME AND 
IT WAS REALLY CLOSE AND GETTING 
NEAR THE WINNING LINE HE HAD A 
STRAIGHT PINK AND HE MISSED IT 
EVERYBODY WAS AGHAST AND FRED'S 
SORT OF COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WHAT 
I ALWAYS REMEMBER I WALKED OUT 
BACKSTAGE AND HIS BROTHER JOE WHO 
HAD BEEN WATCHING THE MATCH WAS 
SLUMPED IN THE CHAIR ASHEN FACED 
HOW DID HE MISS THE PINK 
FRED WAS 
THE BOLDEST EVER SEMI FINALIST AT 
OVER SIXTY YEARS OF AGE THAT WILL 
NEVER BE DONE AGAIN THE OLDEST 
EVER FRED DAVIS WAS ONE OF THE 
GREAT SAFETY PLAYERS 
I THINK HE 
FELT DISAPPOINTED THAT HE HAD BEEN 
SO CLOSE BUT VERY PLEASED THAT HE 
HAD PUT UP SUCH A GOOD PERFORMANCE 
HE WAS STILL PLAYING PROFESSIONALLY 
AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY NINE THERE ARE NOT 
MANY PROFESSIONAL SPORTS MEN WHO 
CAN SAY THAT L. WOULD LIKE TO THINK 
THAT THE LEGACY HE HAS LEFT IS A 
VERY BUOYANT GAME L. AM SURE THAT 
THE GAME IT WILL GO FROM STRENGTH 
TO STRENGTH L. KNOW THAT IF IT 
WASN'T FOR BOTH MY FATHER AND A 
NUMBER OF OTHER PROFESSIONALS OVER 
THE YEARS KEEPING THE GAME ALIVE 
WHEN IT WAS IN THE DOLDRUMS THERE 
WOULD BE NO SNOOKER NOW 
WHEN I'M SIXTY FOUR GET THE CRUCIBLE SEMI 
FINAL WHAT A FAMILY JOE WAS A 
GIANT OF THE GAME NO RELATION 
PEOPLE USED TO ASK YOU THAT YES YES IT WAS HELPFUL THAT MY NAME WAS 
DAVIES I PLAYED MY FIRST MATCH 
AGAINST FRED ON THE TELEVISION 
WHEN THEY INTRODUCED DRUG TESTING 
THEY RANDOMLY TESTED FRED HE WAS 
SEVENTY YEARS OLD HE TESTED POSITIVE 
FOR SOME AFTER GEN INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE PLAYER I PLAYED HIM ONCE WHEN I 
PLAYED IN MY FIRST SEASON YOU 
COULD SEE ALL THE TACTICS WERE 
THERE HE KNEW EVERYTHING AROUND 
THE SNOOKER TABLE BEING IN A SEMI 
FINAL AT SIXTY FOUR 
HE SHAPED THE 
POPULARITY OF THE GAME HIM AND A 
FEW OTHER PLAYERS LAID THE 
FOUNDATIONS 
YES AND IT WAS IN AN FOUNDATIONS ERA WHEN THE GAME WAS NOT AS 
SERIOUS AS IT IS NOW FANTASTIC FANTASTIC TIME TO REFLECT ON A QUITE 
INCREDIBLE SESSION A SNOOKER 
ALREADY PLAYED TODAY RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN AND STEPHEN HENDRY AT 
THE TABLE SESSION OF SNOOKER FOUR 
FOUR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SESSION 
RONNIE FINISHED TWELVE TO FOUR UP STEPHEN 
HENDRY SUFFERING HIS FIRST EVER 
SESSION WHITEWASH AT THE CRUCIBLE 
WE WATCHED THIS IN THE MORNING AND 
EARLY AFTERNOON AND RONNIE WAS A 
TERRIFIC ALTHOUGH STEPHEN MISSED 
HIS CHANCES 
ONCE STEPHEN LET 
RONNIE GET AWAY FROM HIM 
O'SULLIVAN SHOWED WHAT A GENIUS HE 
IS AROUND THE TABLE HE WENT INTO A 
DIFFERENT LEAGUE OF PLAYING IT WAS 
ASTONISHING WHEN O'SULLIVAN IS IN 
THIS MOOD THE REST OF THE PLAYERS 
CAN PUT THEIR CUE AWAY IT WAS 
SUPER 
THIS IS THE END OF A ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE AND SUPER THERE WAS A ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE ON THE BACK OF IT 
WHEN RONNIE IS IN A MOOD LIKE THIS 
WHAT DO YOU DO 
SIT AND WATCH AND 
ADMIRE IT FOR WHAT IT IS IF IT IS 
NOT A GENIUS IT IS BORDERING ON IT 
WE GET ACCUSED OF WAXING LYRICAL 
ABOUT RONNIE HE WAS JUST 
PHENOMENAL THIS MORNING THE LAST 
THREE OR FOUR FRAMES NOBODY COULD 
PLAY BETTER THAN HE DID THIS 
MORNING 
THAT WAS ELEVEN FRAMES IN A MORNING ROW FOR RONNIE O'SULLIVAN RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN AGAINST STEPHEN HENDRY 
BY THE WAY HOW DO YOU PUT HIS 
PERFORMANCE IN CONTEXT 
HE LOOKS SO 
STRONG IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE HAVE 
WORRIED ABOUT HIM NOT ONLY IS HE 
THE GENIUS WE KNOW HE IS IF HE 
GETS HIS MENTAL STATE RIGHT AS HE 
HAS BEEN ALL WEEK YOU HAVE SUCH A 
DANGEROUS PLAYER ON YOUR HANDS IT 
IS HARD TO SEE ANYBODY EVEN HOLDING 
HIM LET ALONE BEATING HIM THE THE SEMI FINAL IS SURELY SETTLED 
PEOPLE WILL SAY THE FINAL IS 
SETTLED BUT YOU NEVER KNOW THERE THERE IS ANOTHER SESSION STEPHEN HAS TO 
WIN THIS SESSION SIX TO TWO TO HAVE A 
CHANCE OVER THE YEARS HE HAS BEEN 
CAPABLE OF DOING IT TO OTHER 
PLAYERS SO HE HAS TO RETAIN THAT 
HOPE 
WHERE DO YOU THINK RONNIE HOPE O'SULLIVAN STANDS IN SPORT OVERALL 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN PLAYER BEING 
ABLE TO PLAY THEIR SPORT RIGHT AND 
LEFT HANDED IN MY EYES HE IS THE 
GREATEST GENIUS SPORTSMEN THERE HAS 
EVER BEEN THERE ARE OTHER GREAT 
PLAYERS LIKE ROGER FEDERER AND 
TIGER WOODS JUST THE GENIUS PART 
IT 
IS BREATHTAKING WHAT HE DOES IT IT IS QUITE A COMPLIMENT THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH THAT IS IT BUT NOT FOR 
LONG WE ARE 
BACK AT SEVEN P. M. HAZEL 
WILL BE HERE WHEN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
AND STEPHEN HENDRY RETURN FOR THE 
THIRD SESSION OF THEIR SEMI FINAL 
RONNIE HAS PLAYED HIS WAY INTO A 
COMMANDING POSITION AND LOOKS 
DESTINED TO REACH THE FINAL AND 
THAT IS IT TIME TO GO WE HAVE OUR 
SERIES OF WHERE ARE THEY NOW OF 
COURSE WE COULD NOT LEAVE THIS MAN 
OUT GOODBYE FOR NOW
