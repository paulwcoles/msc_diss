FARES YOU ARE A DISGRACE A FAMILY'S ANGER AT THREE MEN ARE 
CLEARED OF KILLING A TODDLER HIT BY 
A SPEED BOAT IN THE CARIBBEAN PLUS 
A FIRST LOOK AT THE CELEBRITY 
CAMPAIGN TO HIGHLIGHT THE HUNDREDS 
OF CHILDREN WAITING FOR ADOPTION IN 
THE CAPITAL AND I AM HERE ON THE 
IRONMAN RED CARPET WITH THE 
HERTFORDSHIRE SALESMAN WHO SWEET 
TALKED HIS WAY ON TO A HOLLYWOOD 
FILM SET 
GOOD EVENING KEN LIVINGSTONE HAS 
BEEN ACCUSED OF MISLEADING THE 
PUBLIC ABOUT SECRET PLANS TO RAISE 
TUBE AND BUS FARES AFTER THE 
ELECTION LAST AUTUMNS HE ANNOUNCED 
A FARE FREEZE AND PROMISED THERE'LL 
BE NO INCREASES IF HE WAS RE 
ELECTED AT THAT TIME HE ALREADY 
AGREED WITH HIS TRANSPORT OFFICIALS 
THAT FARE RISES WOULD BE NECESSARY 
TONIGHT BORIS JOHNSON ACCUSED HIM 
OF LYING THIS REPORT FROM OUR 
POLITICAL EDITOR 
WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER FINALLY 
AGREED PLANS FOR CROSSRAIL LOST 
OCTOBER KEN LIVINGSTONE COULD NOT 
HAVE BEEN CLEARER 
IT DOES NOT 
REQUIRE A FUNDING INCREASE IT IS 
THE FARES GENERATED BY CROSSRAIL 
WHICH DO THAT 
A FORTNIGHT LATER 
RENOUNCING A FARE FREEZE FREEZE HE 
RULED OUT INCREASES 
WE WILL CARRY 
ON THIS PATTERN OF FARE INCREASES 
NO MORE THAN THE LEVEL OF INFLATION 
THEN HE REPEATED THAT BEFORE THE 
LONDON ASSEMBLY 
THERE SHOULD NOT 
BE REASON WHY FARES NEED TO RISE IN 
LINE WITH INFLATION 
WE HAVE 
LEARNED THESE PUBLIC STATEMENTS 
CAME AS A SHOCK TO HIS TRANSPORT 
FOR LONDON OFFICIALS LIVINGSTONE 
HAD ALREADY BY THEN AGREED WITH 
THEM THAT FARE RISES WOULD BE 
NEEDED BUS FARES WOULD GO UP BY FIVE PER CENT 
TUBES BY FOUR PER CENT 
IT LED TO A FLURRY OF E. MAILS AMONG 
OFFICIALS SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN 
LEAKED TO US IN ONE THIS WAS SAID 
I THINK IT IS UNBELIEVABLE AND AN 
UTTER SCANDAL THAT THE MAYOR CAN 
SECRETLY AGREE WITH HIS OFFICIALS 
THAT FARES WILL HAVE TO GO UP AFTER 
THE ELECTION AND THEN GO TO THE 
LONDON ELECTORATE AND TELL THEM 
THAT THEY WON'T 
LONDON'S TRANSPORT 
COMMISSIONER ALSO APPEARED 
SURPRISED THAT LIVINGSTONE HAD 
PUBLICLY RULED OUT A FARE INCREASE 
FOR CROSSRAIL HE CLEARLY THOUGHT 
THEY WOULD GO UP BY ONE PER CENT ABOVE 
INFLATION 
KEN LIVINGSTONE LAUNCHED HIS FULL 
MANIFESTO TODAY HE CLAIMS HE 
SIMPLY CHANGED HIS MIND ON FARES 
THEY SUBMIT BUSINESS PLAN ONCE I 
HAVE READ IT I THEN DETERMINE WHAT 
A FAIR STRATEGY WILL BE THAT IS 
THE WAY AROUND IT GOES THE 
BUSINESS PLAN IS SUBMITTED TO THE 
MAYOR IT COMES THROUGH THE 
STRUCTURE THEN I ANALYSE IT WITH 
MY OFFICIALS WHO ARE NOT TRANSPORT 
TFL PEOPLE THEY SAY DO YOU REALLY 
NEED ALL THAT MONEY 
IN THE END TFL 
PUBLISHED A REVISEED PLAN WITH 
FIFTY THOUSAND OF SAVINGS AND NO FARE 
INCREASES AT LEAST FOR NOW 
COMING UP BEFORE SEVEN HUNDRED P. M. REVEALED 
IN ALL ITS SPLENDOUR SAINT MARTIN IN 
THE FIELDS REOPENS ITS DOORS AFTER 
A MULTI MILLION POUND MAKOVER 
THREE MEN HAVE BEEN CLEARED OF 
KILLING A TODDLER WHO WAS HIT BY A 
SPEED BOAT ON A BEACH IN THE 
BAHAMAS SIX YEARS AGO THE FAMILY 
OF PAUL GALLAGHER FROM ORPINGTON IN 
KENT SAY THE DECISION IS DISGRACELE 
AND THEY WILL FIGHT WHAT THEY CALL 
A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE 
THE LITTLE BOY'S FATHER IS HELD 
BACK HIS UNCLE EXPRESSING THE 
FAMILY'S FEELINGS 
THEY DON'T CARE 
ABOUT CHILDREN THEY BREAK THE LAW 
AND THEY ARE PROTECTED THIS IS NOT 
THE END 
A SUPREME COURT JUDGE IN 
THE BAHAMAS DISMISSED THE CASE 
AGAINST THREE LOCAL MEN LACK OF 
EVIDENCE THE REASON TWO YEAR OLD 
PAUL GALLAGHER DIED FROM HEAD 
INJURIES WHEN A SPEED BOAT LEFT THE 
SEA AND LANDED ON THE BEACH WHERE 
HE WAS SLEEPING THE FAMILY FROM 
ORPINGTON IN KENT HAD BEEN ON A 
HOLIDAY HERE IN THE BAHAMAS IT WAS 
AUGUST TWENTY MILLION TWENTY SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE NOW SIX YEARS ON 
AND THE BOAT'S DRIVER AND TWO OTHER 
MEN HAVE BEEN CLEARED OF 
MANSLAUGHTER BY NEGLIGENCE THE 
PROSECUTION THOUGH SAID IT WAS AN 
ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN JUDGE JUDGE LOCKHART SHOULD HAVE HELD HIS HEAD 
IN SHAME HE HAS LET DOWN THE GOOD 
PEOPLE OF THE BAHAMAS OUR 
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BOY WAS CRUELLY 
AND VIOLENTLY KILLED IN FRONT OF 
HIS BROTHER AND SISTER HIS DEATH 
HAS BEEN IGNORED BY THE HIGHEST 
COURT IN THE BAHAMAS 
IT HAS BEEN A 
LONG CAMPAIGN FOR JUSTICE THE 
FOREIGN OFFICE SAYS WATER SPORTS 
HERE ARE POORLY REGULATED DESPITE 
CHANGES IN THE LAW 
HIS FAMILY SAY THEY ARE DETERMINED 
TO FIGHT ON 
YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO 
THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THE BAHAMAS 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TURNED OUT TO 
PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO THE MOTHER OF 
DAMILOLA TAYLOR AT HER FUNERAL 
TODAY GLORIA TAYLOR COLLAPSED 
AFTER SUFFERING A SUSPECTED HEART 
ATTACK TWO WEEKS AGO MOURNERS 
PACKED OUT THE SAME SOUTH LONDON 
CHURCH WHERE HER SON'S FUNERAL WAS 
HELD EIGHT YEARS AGO POLICE 
INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF A MAN 
AT A MATALAN IN HACKNEY HAVE 
RELEASED NEW C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE THIRTY THREE YEAR 
OLD JAMIE SIMPSON WAS STABBED WHILE 
HE CASHED UP ON A SATURDAY EVENING 
LAST MONTH THE OLD BAILEY HAS 
HEARD HOW A FATHER OF TWO WAS RUN 
DOWN AND KILLED AFTER TRYING TO 
STOP THIEFS DRIVING AWAY IN EAST 
LONDON IT IS CLAIMED HE WAS 
DRAGGED BY CAR FOR FORTY METRES 
BEFORE HE DIED TWO MEN WHO WERE 
BROTHERS DENY MURDER NOW THE 
CONSERVATION OF THE CUTTY SARK 
REACHED A MAJOR MILESTONE TODAY 
WHEN A FIVE TONNE SECTION OF THE 
STERN WAS REMOVED FOR RESTORATION 
IT IS A YEAR SINCE THE LANDMARK WAS 
DESTROYED WHEN FIRE BROKE OUT ON BOARD BOARD THE MEDICAL GROUP BEHIND PROPOSED 
RESEARCH CENTRE IN CENTRAL LONDON 
HAVE INSISTED IF GIVEN THE GO AHEAD 
IT WOULD BE SAFE TWO LONDON 
NEWSPAPERS HAD REPORTED THE PLANNED 
MEDICAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION 
CENTRE NEAR KING'S CROSS COULD BE A 
TERRORIST TARGET BECAUSE SCIENTISTS 
WOULD BE RESEARCHING DEADLY VIRUSES 
TODAY THE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN DENIED 
MORE NOW ON NEXT WEEK'S ELECTIONS 
OF COURSE MAY FIRST IS NOT JUST 
CHANCE TO VOTE FOR MAYOR THERE 
ARE TWENTY FIVE SEATS ON THE LONDON ASSEMBLY 
UP FOR GRABS IN THE SECOND OF THIS 
SPECIAL REPORT PAUL LOOKS AT SOME 
OF THE CANDIDATES 
THEY WANT THEM ELECTIONS ARE ALL 
ABOUT GETTING THE BIGGEST PILE OF 
VOTES YOU CAN FOR THE SMALLER 
PARTIES ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND X.'S IN THE RIGHT 
PLACE COULD SEE THEM GETTING SEAT 
ON THE LONDON ASSEMBLY IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
THE RESPECT PARTY CAME CLOSE HE 
HAS TAKEN ON THE U. S. SENATE AND SAID 
HE WOULD DO THE SAME WITH THE MAYOR 
PEOPLE SAY WE NEED A LONDON 
ASSEMBLY WHICH CAN HOD HIM TO 
ACCOUNT ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE 
OTHER FELLOW GETS IN I DON'T WANT 
TO MENTION HIS NAME THERE IS MORE 
OF A REASON FOR HAVING ME ON THE 
LONDON ASSEMBLY THE PEOPLE ON THE 
LONDON ASSEMBLY ARE LARGELY 
UNNAMABLE FEW COULD NAME THEM 
THIS TIME AROUND SOME OF HIS 
OPPONENTS ARE HIS FORMER PARTY 
MEMBERS LINDSEY GERMAN LEADING THE 
CHARGE OF THE LEFT LIST 
IT IS ME 
SMILE THEN I SEE 
THE SPLIT WITH 
RESPECT IS SEEN AS DAMAGING TO BOTH 
PARTIES THE LEFT LIST BELIEVES IT 
IS POLICIES WHICH COUNT MORE WE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO SPEND ALL 
THEIR MONEY SO THEY CAN OWN QUARTER 
OF A STUDIO FLAT WE WANT CHEAP AND 
DECENT TRANSPORT WHICH WE DON'T 
HAVE WE HAVE THE WORST AND MOST 
EXPENSIVE IN THE WORLD 
ALAN CRAIG 
IS A COUNCILLOR IN NEW HAM HE IS 
LOOKING FOR A LONDON STAGE FOR HIS 
CHRISTIAN PARTY'S MESSAGE 
THE CHRISTIAN CHOICE ARE 
CONCENTRATING ON FAMILY MATTERS 
PUSHING FAMILIES AND MARRIAGE ARE 
THE WAY FORWARD 
A LOT OF PEOPLE 
ARE WORRIED ABOUT TEENAGE CRIME SO 
MUCH CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE 
FAMILY WE WANT TO CREATE STABLE 
LOVING FAMILIES IN SO FAR AS 
POLITICIANS CAN DO SO LONDON WIDE LONDON WIDE CANDIDATES ARE STANDING FOR THE 
FIRST TIME AT THESE ELECTIONS 
THEIR NATIONAL BATTLE IS FOR AN 
ENGLISH PARLIAMENT 
OUR AGENDA IN 
TERMS OF GETTING KNIFE CRIME OFF 
THE STREET AND SUCH LIKE IS VERY 
MUCH GOING DOWN THE SPORTING ROUTE 
ENCOURAGING CHILDREN TO GET 
INVOLVED IN COMPETITIVE SPORT 
RUGBY SOCCER BOXING AND THE LIKE 
WE WILL KNOW WHO HAS PICKED UP THE 
ELEVEN SEATS ONCE THE REST OF THE 
CAPITAL'S RESULTS ARE IN NEXT 
FRIDAY BACK TO THE MAYORAL RACE 
NOW ALL THIS WEEK WE HAVE PUT YOUR 
QUESTIONS TO THE THREE MAIN 
CANDIDATES AS PART OF THE 
COLLABORATION WITH THE VIDEO 
SHARING WEBSITE YOUTUBE TODAY WE 
GOT SOME ANSWERS FROM HOPEFUL BRIAN 
PADDICK 
I AM FROM WALTHAMSTOW L. PADDICK WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE MAYOR WHAT HE 
WILL DO ABOUT THE KNIFE CRIME 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE KNOW WHO IT IS 
WHO HAS THE GUN OR THE KNIFE BUT DO 
NOT TRUST THE POLICE ENOUGH TO TELL 
THEM WHO THEY ARE RA LET'S GET 
BACK TO THAT RELATIONSHIP WHERE THE 
PUBLIC ARE AGAINST THE CRIMINAL 
WHY DO THE POLICE WASTE SO MUCH 
TIME HANDLING SMALL DRUG CRIME WHEN 
THEY COULD INVESTIGATE LARGER 
SITUATIONS 
THE MAN SPEAKS MY OWN SITUATIONS LANGUAGE HERE THAT IS WHAT I DID 
IN BRIXTON L. GOT THE POLICE TO 
CONCENTRATE ON HARD DRUGS CRACK 
COCAINE AND HEROIN RATHER THAN 
CRIMINALLISING LARGE NUMBERS OF 
YOUNG PEOPLE FOR SMALL AMOUNTS OF 
CANNABIS 
YOU SAY YOU WOULD TAKE A CANNABIS SOFTER STANCE ON DRUGS LIKE 
CANNABIS 
EVERY CHIEF NEEDS TO CANNABIS LISTEN TO WHAT THE LOCAL PEOPLE 
WANT THE POLICE TO CONCENTRATE ON 
THE QUESTION I WOULD LIKE THE ASK 
IS ARE YOU GOING TO SCRAP THE 
CONGESTION CHARGE IT IS KILLING 
ME I HAVE TWO CHILDREN L. CAN NOT 
AFFORD TO PAY ANY MORE 
UNFORTUNATELY IN THE CENTRAL ZONE 
THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE WHOP WANT 
TO DRIVE IN THE CENTRAL ZONE NOT 
ENOUGH ROAD SPACELY KEEP THE EIGHT L. L. 
WILL NOT PUT IT UP TO TWENTY FIVE LY NOT 
EXEMPT SMALLER CARS WHICH WILL 
CREATE MORE POLLUTION AND MORE 
CONGESTION 
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW CONGESTION WHAT THE NEXT MAYOR OF LONDON WILL 
DO ABOUT THE CRIME ON THE BUSES 
TUBES 
ON THE TEN WORST BUS ROUTES TUBES WE ARE IN TERMS OF INCIDENTS OF 
DISORDER WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 
UNIFORMED PRESENCE MUCH MUCH MORE 
THAN WE HAVE UP UNTIL NOW WHAT I 
AM TALKING ABOUT IS ON EVERY 
UNDERGROUND TRAIN FROM NINE P. M. UNTIL 
THE LAST TRAIN HAVING SOMEONE IN 
DIRECT RADIO COMMUNICATION WITH THE 
POLICE IF YOU ARE FEELING 
VULNERABLE SOMEONE WHO IS OLDER 
SOMEBODY WHO FEELS FRIGHTENED ABOUT 
TRAVELLING ON YOUR OWN YOU WILL 
KNOW THERE IS ONE CARRIAGE WHICH 
WILL BE CLEARLY MARKED WHERE YOU 
CAN GO TO WHERE YOU WILL BE SAFE I I WANT TO ASK YOU PEOPLE STANDING FOR 
ELECTION WHY SHOULD WE VOTE FOR 
YOU 
I AM NOT A PRO DEPEGSAL YOU PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN I SPENT THIRTY 
YEARS AS A POLICE OFFICER L. KNOW 
LONDON FROM GOING INTO PEOPLE'S 
HOMES UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE 
ISSUES ARE AND I HAVE GOT REAL 
SOLUTIONS FOR REAL PEOPLE'S 
PROBLEMS THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN ME AND THE OTHERS BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AS A 
POLICEMAN DOES THAT MEAN YOU HAVE 
THE EXPERIENCE OF RUNNING A BIG 
ORGANISAION LIKE THE MAYOR WOULD 
HAVE TO 
WHEN I WAS A POLICE 
COMMANDER IN LAMBETH I HAD A THIRTY SEVEN 
MILLION BUDGET THE SECOND TO LAST 
JOB I HAD AT SCOTLAND YARD I HAD 
TWENTY THOUSAND OFFICERS DELIVERING POLICING 
SERVICES ACROSS LONDON BOROUGHS IT 
IS SIMILAR TO THE ORGANISATION THE 
MAYOR IS RUNNING NOWVY THE 
EXPERIENCE I CAN DO THE JOB I I WOULD LIKE THE ASK THE NEW MAYOR 
WHO WILL HE DO ABOUT ALL THE 
CIGARETTE BUTTS ON THE STREET IT 
WILL BE LIKE THE CHEWING GUM 
PROBLEM 
THE PROBLEM HAS GONE FROM PROBLEM SMOKING IN DOORS TO SMOKING 
OUTDOORS WE HAVE TO PROVIDE A 
SOLUTION THAT MEANS PLACES WHERE 
PEOPLE CAN STUB OUT CIGARETTES AND 
DISPOSE OF THE ENDS 
I WANT TO KNOW 
IF THERE ARE ANY PLANS TO IMPROVE 
THE WAY TRAFFIC FLOWS FREING UL 
BUSES MAKING SURE THEY ARE NOT SO 
BUSY 
THERE IS A SATELLITE SYSTEM BUSY ON BUSES SO IF THEY WANTED TO THEY 
COULD SPACE THE BUSES OUT ARONG THE 
ROUTE THEY COULD SEE WHERE THEY 
ARE ON THE MAP THEY DON'T WANT 
THREE BUSES AT ONCE AND THEN NOT 
ONE FOR HALF AN HOUR 
MY QUESTION 
IS AS I AM A RECENT IMMIGRANT TO 
LONDON MYSELF WHAT THINGS WILL YOU 
DO TO IMPROVE THE WELCOMING NATURE 
OF LONDON FOR RECENT IMMIGRANTS 
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY IN 
THE UP COMING OLYMPICS WHEN LONDON 
WILL OPEN ITS DOORS FROM PEOPLE 
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
THE OLYMPICS PROVIDE A GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY FOR LONDONERS TO SHARE 
THEIR CULTURE TO OTHER NATIONS AS 
THE TEAMS COME HERE IT'S A GREAT 
MULTI CULTURAL CITY AS IT IS THESE 
IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE COMING HERE WANT 
TO WORK HARD THEY WANT TO MAKE A 
VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE CITY 
AND THE MAYOR SHOULD BE SAYING 
LONDON IS A MUCH BETTER PLACE FOR 
HAVING THESE IMMIGRANTS HERE WE WE WANT TO ASK WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE 
ICE CREAM IF YOU COULD USE YOUR 
POWERS TO PUT A BUBBLE OVER THE U. K. 
STOP IT RAINING 
KEN LIVINGSTONE 
MIGHT THINK HE'S GOD BUT HE CAN'T 
CONTROL THE WEATHER L. WOULDN'T 
CLAIM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AS WELL 
I WAS TALKING TO MY PARTNER AND HE 
WAS SAYING HOW DISAPPOINTED HE IS 
WITH THE LONDON SPRING THIS YEAR 
AND I SHOULD PLEDGE TO MAKE AT 
LEAST TWO DAYS A WEEK SUNNY THAT 
IS GOING A BIT BEYOND THE REMIT OF 
THE MAYOR I THINK THERE IS A 
LIMITED EDITION RASPBERRY AND 
MERINGUE ICE CREAM IT IS 
FANTASTIC 
YOU CAN SEE BRIAN FANTASTIC PADDICK ANSWERING QUESTIONS ON 
YOUTUBE'S LONDON MAYOR CHANNEL AS 
WELL AS INTERVIEWS WITH KEN 
LIVINGSTONE AND BORIS JOHNSON 
STAY WITH US STILL TO COME FORGET 
THE A LIST STARS THE MAN WHO

WATCHING THE FILM NOW THAT MAKES 
ONE NIGHT KIND OF NIGHT GWYNETH 
PALTROW'S JUST ARRIVED THEY ARE 
GOING TO BE SIPPING CHAMPAGNE 
RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH HER AND THEN 
IT IS BACK TO NEB WORTH FOR A PINT 
KNEBWORTH FOR A PINT A GROUP OF 
CELEBRITIES HAS JOINED A NEW 
CAMPAIGN TO HELP FIND HOMES FOR 
THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WAITING FOR 
ADOPTION NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED CHILDREN WERE 
ADOPTED IN THE LAST YEAR BUT MANY 
MORE ARE NEEDING SOMEWHERE TO CALL 
HOME HOME NICOLE KIDMAN AND TOM CRUISE AND OF 
COURSE MADONNA HAVE ALL ATTRACTED 
NEWSPAPER COLUMN INCHES FOR 
ADOPTING CHILDREN FROM AROUND THE 
WORLD CLOSER TO HOME A NEW 
EXHIBITION HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE 
THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN IN THE CARE 
SYSTEM DESPERATE FOR THEIR OWN 
FAMILY 
COLIN SALMON ARE AMONGST THE 
CELEBRITIES WHO TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF 
CHILDREN IN NEED OF ADOPTION THE THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO 
ADOPT CHILDREN BUT NOT JUST ANY 
CHILDREN THE NEED HARDEST TO PLACE 
THESE KID ALSO BE A LITTLE BIT 
OLDER THEY WILL PROBABLY BE FROM 
TOUGHER BACKGROUNDS THE WAY WE ARE 
DOING IS BORROWED FROM AMERICA 
WHERE THEY HAVE A THING CALLED THE 
HEART GALLERIES L. HAVE GOT ANY 
CELEBRITY TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THE 
CHILD 
HOME TIME WAS CAMBRIDGE CHILD JONES' BRAINCHILD HE TOO WAS 
ADOPTED 
WHAT I HAVEN'T DONE IS ADOPTED ASKED FORTY CELEBRITIES TO TAKE A KID 
HOME FOR CHRISTMAS L. HAVE ASKED IF 
THEY WILL HELP US SHINE A LIGHT ON 
THE PROBLEM SO THE MESSAGE GETS 
THROUGH TO PEOPLE WHO PERHAPS 
WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT 
OTHERWISE 
IN THE U. S. FORTY PER CENT OF THE OTHERWISE CHILDREN PHOTOGRAPHED IN A SIMILAR 
PROJECT WERE FOUND HOMES THE 
BOROUGHS ARE NOT NAIVE TO THE 
CHALLENGES 
PEOPLE WANT TO ADOPT CHALLENGES YOUNG CHILDREN AND THERE ARE MORE 
CHILDREN THAN ADOPTERS IT IS VERY 
DIFFICULT TO PLACE OUR SLIGHTLY 
OLDER CHILDREN FOR NEWHAM WE HAVE 
A WIDE RANGE OF ETHNIC DIVERSITY IN 
OUR CHILDREN AND THAT IS ALSO A 
PARTICULAR DEMAND 
I THINK THAT 
THERE IS A DEFINITE NEED AND WHEN 
YOU ARE ASKED TO DO SOMETHING 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU BELIEVE INTO IT 
YOU PUT YOUR HEART AND SOUL INTO IT 
IT IS NOT WHETHER YOU ARE A 
CELEBRITY OR NOT THE CHILDREN ARE 
NOT KNOWN WE WANT THEM TO BE KNOWN 
FOR THE CHILDREN THAT THEY ARE THE 
LOVING GIFTED CHILDREN THAT THEY 
ARE AND BE ADOPTED 
HEATHER SMALL 
TIME FOR A CHECK ON THE WEATHER 
PETER IS IN HIGH WYCOMBE IT HAS 
BEEN CHANGEABLE TO SAY THE LEAST

QUICKLY AND THE CLOUD'S 
DISAPPEARING QUITE QUICKLY WE WILL 
END UP WITH A CLEAR NIGHT VERY 
SIMILAR TO LAST NIGHT I THINK 
TEMPERATURES IN CENTRAL LONDON DOWN 
TO NINE C. DOWN THERE IN THE VALLEY 
SOMEWHERE AROUND SEVEN C. THERE COULD BE 
A BIT OF MIST BY MORNING TOMORROW 
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE LOTS OF BLUE 
SKY TO START OFF WITH PROBABLY THE 
BEST OF THE BLUE SKY IN THE MORNING 
A LITTLE HAZIER THE SUNSHINE BY THE 
AFTERNOON A BIT MORE CLOUD AROUND 
BUT THE BREEZE WILL KEEP IT ON THE 
MOVE WE SHOULD SEE TOP 
TEMPERATURES OF SIXTEEN TO SEVENTEEN C. IT LOOKS AS 
THOUGH IT COULD BE WARMER THAN THAT 
FOR THE START OF THE WEEKEND 
TEMPERATURE OF TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE PERHAPS 
SOMEWHERE IN THE GREATER LONDON 
AREA IF WE GET THAT THEN IT WILL 
BE THE WARMEST DAY OF THE YEAR SO 
FAR AS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IN
