CRACKDOWN ON SELLING KNIVES TO

CYBERSPACE COULD MAKE OR BREAK 
LONDON'S MAYORAL CANDIDATES 
A GOOD AFTERNOON IT HAS BEEN 
ANOTHER DRAMATIC DAY IN THE 
INVESTIGATION SURROUNDING THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF NINE YEAR OLD 
SHANNON MATTHEWS HER MOTHER HAS 
APPEARED IN COURT IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE ALLEGED ABDUCTION OF HER 
DAUGHTER SHE IS CHARGED WITH 
ABANDONING THE SHANNON AND 
REPEATEDLY CONCEALING INFORMATION 
ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF HER DAUGHTER 
FROM THE POLICE 
GOOD AFTERNOON THIS MORNING'S 
HEARING ONLY LASTED THIRTY MINUTES IT 
WAS A LATER STAGE IN A MASSIVE 
POLICE INVESTIGATION IT IS NOT 
QUITE OVER YET 
ON HER WAY TO COURT THIS MORNING IN 
HANDCUFFS THE MOTHER OF SHANNON 
MATTHEWS WATCHING THE PROCEEDINGS 
FROM THE PUBLIC GALLERY HER 
FRIENDS MEMBERS OF HER FAMILY AND 
NEIGHBOURS THE COURT WAS NOT BIG 
ENOUGH FOR ALL OF THEM TO GET IN 
SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS WERE ALSO IN 
COURT FOR THE SHORT HEARING 
KAREN MATTHEWS WAS ARRESTED ON 
SUNDAY AND AFTER TWO DAYS OF 
QUESTIONING IT WAS ANNOUNCED LAST 
NIGHT THAT SHE HAD BEEN CHARGED WE WE HAVE DECIDED THAT THERE IS AN 
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND HAVE 
AUTHORISED THAT KAREN MATTHEWS BE 
CHARGED WITH PERVERTING THE COURSE 
OF JUSTICE AND CHILD NEGLECT 
SPECIFICALLY SHE IS ACCUSED OF 
CONCEALING INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
WHEREABOUTS OF HER DAUGHTER AND 
CLAIMING NOT TO KNOW WHERE SHE WAS 
SHANNON WAS FOUND IN A HOUSE ONE 
MILE FROM HER HOME TWENTY FOUR DAYS AFTER 
BEING REPORTED MISSING 
DURING THE BRIEF HEARING THIS 
MORNING THE CHARGES AGAINST KAREN 
MATTHEWS WERE READ OUT ONE BY ONE 
SHE WILL APPEAR IN COURT AGAIN ON 
WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK IN THE 
MEANTIME SHE IS BEING REMANDED IN 
CUSTODY THE QUESTION EVERYONE HERE 
IN DEWSBURY IS ASKING TODAY IS 
WHAT NEXT FOR THE POLICE 
INVESTIGATION I WAS TOLD THIS 
MORNING THAT SIXTY POLICE OFFICERS ARE 
STILL WORKING ON THIS CASE AND THAT 
SOME FURTHER ARRESTS HAVE NOT BEEN 
RULED OUT 
THE TERRORISTS US SUSPECT IT ABU 
QATADA WHO HAS BEEN NAMED AS OSAMA 
BIN LADEN'S RIGHT HAND MAN IN 
EUROPE HAS WON AN APPEAL AGAINST 
THE GOVERNMENT WHICH COULD LEAD TO 
HIM BEING FREED HE IS IN CUSTODY 
AND HAD BEEN FACING DEPORTATION TO 
JORDAN THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WILL 
APPEAL REMIND US WHO ABU QATADA 
HIS HIS HIS REAL NAME HE IS A JORDANIAN 
WHO CAME TO THIS COUNTRY IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE 
FLEEING PERSECUTION IN JORDAN HE 
WAS DESCRIBED AS A SPANISH JUDGE AS 
OSAMA BIN LADEN'S RIGHT HAND MAN IN 
EUROPE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ENOUGH 
EVIDENCE TO PUT HIM ON TRIAL IN 
THIS COUNTRY HE BECAME ONE OF THE 
GROUP OF PEOPLE ARRESTED AFTER NINE ELEVEN 
AND HELD IN PRISON WITHOUT TRIAL 
THAT POLICY WAS OVERTURNED AND A 
NEW POLICY WAS INTRODUCED OF TRYING 
TO DEPORT PEOPLE LIKE ABU QATADA 
WHAT IS THE JUDGMENT BEEN 
THE JUDGMENT HAS SAID THAT AT THE 
MOMENT THERE WERE ASSURANCES THAT 
HE WOULD NOT BE TORTURED IN JORDAN 
BUT THERE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT 
ASSURANCES THAT HIS TRIAL IN JORDAN 
BECAUSE HE WILL CERTAINLY FACE A 
TRIAL WOULD BE FAIR SPECIFICALLY 
THE EVIDENCE FROM PEOPLE WHO MIGHT 
BE GIVING EVIDENCE UNDER TORTURE 
ONE NOT BE USED AGAINST HIM THERE 
IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THAT IS THE 
CASE SO TORTURE EVIDENCE COULD BE 
USED THAT BREACHES ARTICLE SIX OF 
THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN 
RIGHTS AND THEREFORE HE SHOULD NOT 
BE RETURNED IT IS UP TO THE 
GOVERNMENTS TO TRY AND OVERTURN 
THAT DECISION A VERY SENIOR 
JUDGE'S DECISION HE WILL STAY IN 
PRISON FOR NOW BUT THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS GOT TO FIND NEW AGREEMENT 
WITH JORDAN OR WAY OF OVERTURNING 
THIS DECISION 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF N. H. S. WORKERS SAY THEY FACE 
ABUSE BY PATIENTS OVER THERE BY 
PATIENTS OR THEIR RELATIVES LAST 
YEAR THE PUBLIC SECTOR UNION 
UNISON HAS SAID THAT THE FIGURES 
WERE DEPRESSINGLY HIGH 
CAN YOU IMAGINE GOING INTO WORK 
EACH DAY KNOWING THAT SHE MIGHT 
FACE SOME SORT OF ABUSE OR POSSIBLY 
EVEN A PHYSICAL ATTACK THIRTY NINE THOUSAND N. H. S. 
STAFF IN ENGLAND LAST YEAR SAID 
THAT THEY DID FACE SOME KIND OF 
ABUSE AND THERE WERE SEVEN THOUSAND SIMILAR 
INCIDENTS IN WALES AS WELL DID 
THE NIGHT SHIFT AT GATESHEAD'S 
QUEEN ELIZABETH HOSPITAL TO TRY AND 
FIND OUT IF N. H. S. STAFF REALLY ARE 
UNDER THREAT 
ELBOWS IN THE THROAT THIS HOSPITAL 
WORKER IS BEING ATTACKED BY A DRUNK 
AGGRESSIVE PATIENT 
THIRTY NINE THOUSAND N. H. S. STAFF SAY THEY HAVE 
SUFFERED ABUSE LIKE THIS IN THE 
PAST YEAR AT GATESHEAD JUST ONE 
HOUR EARLIER WE SAW ANOTHER 
PATIENT BECOME AGGRESSIVE AND 
ABUSIVE 
ABUSIVE 
PATIENT BECOME AGGRESSIVE AND ABUSIVE 
PATIENT BECOME AGGRESSIVE AND ABUSIVE WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED IS 
VERY MUCH REFLECTED IN TODAY'S 
FIGURES TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF STAFF SAY THAT THEY 
HAVE SUFFERED SOME FORM OF ABUSE OR 
HARASSMENT THIRTEEN PER CENT SAY THAT THEY HAVE 
ACTUALLY BEEN PHYSICALLY ATTACKED 
OF THOSE JUST SIXTY SIX PER CENT WENT ON TO 
REPORT IT 
N. H. S. STAFF ARE VULNERABLE THEY DEAL 
WITH SICK AND INJURED PEOPLE WHO 
CAN BECOME VIOLENT THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS ALREADY ANNOUNCED NINETY SEVEN MILLION 
FOR TRUSTS TO HELP IMPROVE SECURITY 
FOR MANY STAFF IT IS STILL VERY 
FRUSTRATING 
I WENT INTO A FRUSTRATING RESTAURANT AND STARTED IF I WENT 
INTO REP RESTAURANT AND STARTED 
TAKING SWINGS AT PEOPLE THAT IS 
NOT ACCEPTABLE WHY SHOULD IT BE 
ACCEPTED IN A HOSPITAL OF ALL 
PLACES 
UNISON SAYS URGENT ACTION PLACES IS NEEDED TO PUT AN END TO THESE 
ATTACKS THE UNION SAYS THE NUMBERS 
REPORTED REMAIN DEPRESSINGLY HIGH 
IN WALES THE ASSEMBLY GOVERNMENT 
HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT THEY WANT TO 
SEE POLICE OFFICERS IN ACCIDENT AND 
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND OF COURSE 
IN ENGLAND AS WELL WE ARE SEEING 
GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT INVESTMENTS 
TO PREVENT ATTACKS BUT IS IT GOING 
TO BE ENOUGH THIS MAN IS A 
CONSULTANT HERE AT THE HOSPITAL IN 
GATESHEAD CAN YOU GIVE ME AN IDEA 
THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER IN VARIOUS 
DIFFERENT HOSPITALS THE KIND OF 
EXPERIENCES YOU HAVE HAD WITH 
ABUSIVE PATIENTS 
IT RANGES FROM 
SOMEBODY SWEARING AT YOUR BEING 
AGGRESSIVE VERBALLY TO SOMEBODY 
ACTUALLY TRYING TO PICTURE OR 
HITTING YOU L. HAVE BEEN CHASED 
DOWN THE CORRIDOR BEFORE OR BY 
QUITE A FEW PEOPLE NOT JUST ONE 
PERSON I HAD TO RUN OUT OF THE 
DEPARTMENT FOR SAFETY THAT WAS NOT 
NECESSARILY IN THIS HOSPITAL THOSE 
OTHER TIMES WHERE PATIENTS HAVE 
COME IN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF 
ALCOHOL AND THEY HAVE WOKEN UP AND 
THE FIRST THING THEY HAVE TRIED TO 
DO IS PUNCHED ME AS SOON AS THEY 
HAVE WOKEN UP OFTEN THEY REGRET 
IT MOST OF THE TIME IT 
DOES 
NOT 
INVOLVE PHYSICAL ACTION NORMALLY 
IT IS WEARING AND VERBAL INSULTS 
THOSE ARE JUST THE THINGS THAT 
HAPPEN TO YOU CAN YOU GIVE US AN 
IDEA IN A DEPARTMENT LIKE THIS 
BEING VERY TYPICAL A AND AMP E. 
DEPARTMENT THE NUMBERS OF STAFF 
YOU HAVE SEEN ATTACKED 
THERE ARE A 
LIMITED NUMBER PER HERE WHO DO HAVE 
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AGAINST THEM WE 
CAN PROSECUTE THOSE PATIENTS AND WE 
WOULD GET THE POLICE INVOLVED WE 
HAVE A GOOD SCHEME FOR THAT ON A 
DAY TO DAY LEVEL WE HAVE PATIENTS 
WHO WILL COME IN AND BE VERBALLY 
AGGRESSIVE TOO MANY OF OUR STAFF 
MOST STAFF IN A NEED APARTMENTS IN 
THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE RECENTLY 
EXPERIENCED THE OTHER SIDE OF 
SOMEONE'S ANGER AND AGGRESSION YOU YOU HAVE MEASURES IN THE HOSPITAL TO 
PROTECT THE STAFF ONE OF THEM IS 
THIS ALARM CAN YOU SHOW US THAT 
THIS IS PANIC ALARM WE PULLED 
THE CORD OUT AS SOON AS WE FEEL NTH 
THREAT ALL STAFF WERE THESE THAT 
SETS THE ALARM GOING FOR THE A 
DEPARTMENT AND ALSO ALERTS HOSPITAL 
SECURITY STAFF WE ARE FORTUNATE 
THAT WE HAVE A GOOD SECURITY 
ARRANGEMENT STAFF ARE TRAINED ON 
HOW TO DEAL WITH VIOLENT AND 
AGGRESSIVE PATIENTS AS PART OF 
THEIR TRAINING IN ADDITION WE 
HAVE POLICE OFFICER THAT SERVES 
THE HOSPITAL AND THEY ARE VERY GOOD 
AT RESPONDING ALSO DEALING WITH 
PATIENTS IF SOMEONE HAS BEEN 
AGGRESSIVE THE POLICE WILL OFTEN 
GO TO THEIR HOUSE AT LATER STAGE 
AND TELL THEM THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE 
BEHAVIOUR 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS BEHAVIOUR WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THE GOVERNMENT 
MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 
INVESTMENT IN SEPTEMBER IT IS 
GOING TO TAKE A WHILE FOR THAT TO 
FILTER DOWN PERHAPS AT THE NEXT 
STAFF SURVEY WE MIGHT START TO SEE 
THE REFLECTION OF THAT INVESTMENT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH PRESSURE IS 
MOUNTING ON THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO 
CUT INTEREST RATES A TWO DAY 
MEETING OF ITS MONETARY POLICY 
COMMITTEE HAS JUST BEGUN WE WILL 
FIND OUT TOMORROW WHAT THEY HAD 
DECIDED DISCUSSIONS COME AGAINST A 
BACKGROUND OF GLOOMY FORECASTS 
ABOUT THE ECONOMY THIS AFTERNOON 
THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
WILL SAY IT EXPECTS THE U. K.'S 
ECONOMY TO GROW MORE SLOWLY THAN 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS PREDICTED 
IS THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK BECOMING 
STORMY THE CHANCELLOR CUT HIS 
PREDICTION FOR HOW WELL HE THINKS 
THE ECONOMY WILL DO IN HIS FIRST 
BUDGET BUT HE DID NOT CUT AS FAR 
AS SOME THINK HE SHOULD HAVE HE'S 
STILL SOUNDING UPBEAT 
I DO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GET 
THROUGH WHAT IS AN UNPRECEDENTED 
SHOCK TO THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM 
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AN 
UNDERLYING ECONOMY THAT IS REALLY 
STRONG 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR STRONG INTEREST RATES WORRIES OVER THE 
ECONOMY HAVE LED TO CALLS FOR A 
RATE CUT TOMORROW MANY THINK THE 
BANK SIMPLY HAS NO CHOICE SOME SOME THINK THAT THE ECONOMY WAS WHAT WE 
WANTED NOT THE KIND OF SLAYED 
THAT WE EXPECTED IN THE NEXT FEW 
MONTHS WE RECKON THAT GROWTH WILL 
GRIND CRIMES TO A STANDSTILL 
THAT IS WHY THE BANK IS CUTTING 
INTEREST RATES AND ARE LIKELY TO 
CUT THE MORE 
IF RATES ARE CUT IT 
MIGHT NOT MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE TO 
HOMEOWNERS MORTGAGE RATES HAVE 
BEEN GOING UP BECAUSE OF THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH TODAY H. S. B. C. SAID IT WILL 
MATCH SOMEONE'S OLD FIXED RATE 
MORTGAGE IF IT RUNS OUT IN THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF MONTHS AS LONG AS THEY 
HAVE A TWENTY PER CENT DEPOSIT 
IF YOU HAVE 
MISSED PAYMENTS IN THE PAST WHERE 
BEFORE A LENDER MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN 
TOO BOTHERED NOW THEY WILL LOOK 
MORE CLOSELY AT THAT SO YES FOR 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT 
DEPOSITS AND A GOOD CREDIT HISTORY 
THERE SHOULD NOT HAVE A PROBLEM 
FINDING A REMORTGAGE FOR THOSE WHO 
ARE NOT IN THAT POSITION IT IS 
MORE DIFFICULT 
WHAT HAPPENS TO 
MORTGAGES MAY HAVE BIG IMPLICATIONS 
FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE CHANCELLOR 
IF PEOPLE PUT MORE MONEY ASIDE TO 
PAY FOR THEIR MORTGAGE THAT MEANS 
LESS FOR SPENDING WHICH IS WHAT 
HAS BEEN DRIVING THE ECONOMY FOR 
THE LAST DECADE 
CHINA'S APPOINTED GOVERNOR IN TIBET 
HAS WARNED THAT THERE WILL BE 
SEVERE PUNISHMENT FOR ANYONE WHO 
DISRUPTS THE OLYMPIC TORCH'S 
JOURNEY THROUGH THE PROVINCE ON ITS 
WAY TO THE BEIJING GAMES TALKS 
THE TORCH IS NOW IN SAN FRANCISCO 
SECURITY IS TIGHT AHEAD OF THE 
RELATED DAY WERE MORE PROTESTS ARE 
EXPECTED EXPECTED FREE TIBET NOW 
IN SAN FRANCISCO 
PROTESTERS ARE READY THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH IS COMING THESE PEOPLE WILL 
BE THERE TO MEET IT THE 
DEMONSTRATORS CALLED ON CHINA TO 
STOP KILLING INTO THAT TIBET 
THEY WILL BE INTERESTED TO HEAR THE 
WORDS OF THIS MAN CHINA'S GOVERNOR 
OF TO THAT THE GOVERNOR INSISTED 
THAT PEOPLE IN TO THAT ENJOYED 
GREATER DEMOCRACY THAN THEY EVER 
HAVE BEFORE HE BALANCED THIS WITH 
A WARNING 
IF THERE ANY PROBLEMS 
DURING THE RELATE TO MOUNT EVEREST 
IF ANYONE DARES TO CREATE ANY 
TROUBLE WE WILL WITHOUT DOUBT 
DEAL WITH THOSE PERSONS SEVERELY 
WE WILL NOT BE MERCIFUL THIS THIS AFTERNOON THESE TIBETAN MONKS 
IGNORE ITS CHINA'S WARNINGS THE 
GROUP GATECRASHED A TOUR OF A 
MONASTERY IN A CHINESE PROVINCE 
THEY CALLED FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
ALSO FOR THE RETURN FROM EXILE OF 
THE DALAI LAMA 
IF THE MONKS TRIED TO PROTEST AS 
THE TORCH GOES BY THEY MAY COME UP 
AGAINST THE INCREASINGLY FAMOUS MEN 
IN BLUE AND WHITE TRACKSUITS CHINA 
CALLS THEM AFLAME GUARDIANS 
SEBASTIAN COE HAS CALLED THEM THUGS 
OTHER BIG OFFICIALS TOLD THE B. B. C. 
THAT THE MEN ARCHITECTS CHOSEN FROM 
THE PEOPLE'S ARMED POLICE ACADEMY 
THAT IS CHINA'S MAIN SECURITY FORCE 
THERE ARE STILL FOURTEEN COUNTRIES TO GO 
BEFORE THE TORCH RELAY GETS YOU TO 
CHINA OUTSIDE THIS COUNTRY CANNOT 
CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS HERE AT HOME 
THE FLAME GUARDIANS AND THE 
SECURITY FORCES WILL HAVE A LOT 
MORE POWER TO STOP PROTESTERS FROM 
GETTING IN THE WAY 
PLAID CYMRU HAS SET OUT ITS 
POLICIES FOR THE FORTHCOMING LOCAL 
ELECTIONS IN WALES THEY WILL FOCUS 
ON GREEN ISSUES THE PARTY'S LEADER 
SAYS HE IS CONFIDENT OF MAKING 
GAINS IN THE POLL BUT OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IS IN CARDIFF BAY NOW 
YES THEY ARE IN CONFIDENT MOOD 
AFTER DOING WELL IN THE RECENT 
WELSH ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS BUT THEY 
NOW HAVE TO TRANSLATE THAT SUCCESS 
DOWN TO A LOCAL LEVEL SO TODAY 
THERE WAS A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON 
REORGANISING WHAT THEY CALLED 
MORIBUND LOCAL POLITICS THEY ARE 
PUTTING A BIG EMPHASIS ON GREEN 
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
WE WILL BE LOOKING TO INSTALL GREEN 
ROOM SO ON TO ALL NEW BUILT FLAT 
ROOFED COUNCIL BUILT PROPERTIES 
AND INVESTIGATING HOW WE CAN FIT 
THEM RETROSPECTIVELY ON EXISTING 
BUILDINGS WE WOULD LOOK TO DEVELOP 
INNOVATIVE NEW UNDERGROUND OF 
RUBBISH AND RECYCLING BINS IN NEW 
DEVELOPMENTS DEVELOPMENTS OF COURSE PLAID CYMRU DRAWS A LOT 
OF SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE IN RURAL 
AREAS THE WELSH SPEAKING PARTS OF 
WALES THINGS WHICH MATTER TO THEM 
ARE SMALL SCHOOLS AND RURAL 
TRANSPORT BUT ONE OF THOROUGHLY 
MODERN POLITICAL DILEMMA FOR PLAID 
CYMRU IS THAT HERE IN CARDIFF THEY 
ARE IN COALITION WITH A LABOUR 
PARTY AND THEY ARE NOW HAVING TO 
FIGHT AGAINST THEM IN THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS 
NOW OUR TOP STORIES SHANNON 
MATTHEWS' MOTHER HAS APPEARED IN 
COURT CHARGED WITH CONCEALING 
INFORMATION ABOUT HER DAUGHTER'S 
WHEREABOUTS COMING UP THE PRICE 
OF PAVING WHY IN FUTURE YOU MIGHT 
NEED PERMISSION TO DIG UP THE FRONT 
GARDEN ON B. B. C. LONDON ARSENAL'S 
AGONY AND CHELSEA'S ECSTASY 
WE HAVE A ROUND UP OF LAST NIGHT'S 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE ACTION 
TWO CHARITIES HAVE GONE TO COURT 
TODAY TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO DO 
MORE TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM OF FUEL 
POVERTY CAMPAIGNERS FROM HELP THE 
AGED AND FRIENDS OF THE EARTH SAY 
THE GOVERNMENT IS IN DANGER OF 
MISSING ITS OWN TARGETS ON HELPING 
PEOPLE CUT THEIR HEATING COSTS THREE 
MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ARE EXPECTED TO 
HAVE DIFFICULTIES PAYING FUEL BILLS 
IN ENGLAND ALONE THIS YEAR ROSINA 
COTTRELL A PENSIONER TOLD US HOW 
SHE IS COPING 
I THINK AT THIS AGE WE HAVE HAD 
ALL OF OUR WORRIES AND EVERYTHING 
AND I KNOW LIFE IS NEVER FREE OF 
WORRY BUT THERE ARE SOME WORRIES 
THAT COULD BE EASED A LITTLE BIT 
AND JUNEAU NOT HAVING TO WORRY 
ABOUT WHETHER YOU SHOULD BUY THAT 
EXTRA PIECE OF MEAT OR WHETHER YOU 
SHOULD PUT THAT MONEY TOWARDS THE 
GAS IT'S WRONG IT'S VERY EASY TO 
PUT IT ALL ON AND THINK LOVELY 
IT'S HOT BUT IT'S WHEN THE BILL 
DROPS THROUGH THE DOOR AND YOU SEE 
HANG ON A MINUTE I HAVE GOT 
BILL FOR FOUR HUNDRED HERE WELL THAT IS 
ONLY ONE BILL THERE ARE OTHER 
BILLS YOU HAVE TO PAY AND THAT IS 
WHEN OLDER PEOPLE GET WORRIED 
THAT WAS ROSINA COTTRELL LET'S 
SPEAK NOW TO A REPRESENTATIVE OF 
HELP THE AGED SHE IS ONE OF THREE 
MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE SO CONCERNED 
AND YET THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS 
DOING ALL IT CAN TO EASE WINTER 
FUEL WORRIES YOU ARE TAKING THEM 
TO COURT 
AND THIS IS WHY WE ARE 
TAKING THEM TO COURT WE DO NOT 
THINK THEY ARE DOING ALL THAT THEY 
CAN THE FUEL POVERTY FIGURES FELL 
IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF THIS 
CENTURY BUT THEN SINCE ENERGY 
PRICES STARTED GOING UP SO HAVE 
THE NUMBERS IN FUEL POVERTY SO WE 
HAVE NOW GOT MORE PEOPLE IN FUEL 
POVERTY THAN WE HAVE WON THE FUEL 
POVERTY STRATEGY WAS FIRST DEVISED 
IN TWO THOUSAND ONE INSTEAD OF ERADICATING IT 
WE'RE SEEING IT INCREASE L. DO NOT 
THINK THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT DOING ALL IT CAN THE THE GOVERNMENT OH TWO FACTORS SUCH AS HIGH 
FUEL PRICES IT POINTS OUT THAT IT 
IS PROVIDING WINTER FUEL PAYMENTS 
AND SAYING THAT SUCH MEASURES ARE 
HELPING 
THESE FACTORS WILL HELP HELPING THERE IS A PACKAGE OF THINGS THAT 
WE WANT TO SEE COMING FORWARD BUT 
THE BIT WHICH IS NOT BEING 
MENTIONED BY THE GOVERNMENT AT THE 
MOMENT IS ITS OWN PROGRAMME WHICH 
IS ABOUT INSULATING AND DRAUGHT 
PROOFING IMPROVING CENTRAL HEATING 
SYSTEMS THINGS LIKE THAT WE'RE 
TAKING THIS ISSUE TO COURT TO THE 
HIGH COURT WITH FRIENDS OF THE 
EARTH BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO WAYS 
OF DEALING WITH FUEL POVERTY ONE 
IS TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE MONEY AND 
THE OTHER IS TO ACTUALLY MAKE THEIR 
HOMES ENERGY EFFICIENT SO THAT 
THEY CAN KEEP ADEQUATELY WARM AT AN 
AFFORDABLE RATE AND WE HAVE GOT TO 
DO THAT IN THE LONG RUN REDUCING 
OUR GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS IS AN 
ASPECT OF OUR WHOLE CLIMATE CHANGE 
STRATEGY 
WHAT HOPE DO YOU HAVE OF STRATEGY WINNING THIS ONE 
THE CASE ON PAPER 
IT LOOKS GOOD BECAUSE GOING BACK 
TO THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND PARLIAMENT PASSED 
AN ACT LAYING DOWN TARGETS FOR THE 
ERADICATION OF FUEL POVERTY THE 
GOVERNMENT ACCEPTED THEM AND NOW 
IF GOVERNMENT WANTS TO CHANGE THE 
RULES IT HAS GOT TO GET 
PARLIAMENT'S PERMISSION OR ANSWER 
TO THE HIGH COURT 
NO DOUBT WE WILL 
HAVE YOU BACK TO SPEAK AGAIN THANK 
YOU YOU MOHAMED AL FAYED SAYS HE WILL 
ABANDON HIS TEN YEAR LEGAL BATTLE 
TO PROVE HIS BELIEF THAT HIS SON 
DODI AND DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES 
WERE MURDERED HE SAYS HE WILL 
ACCEPT WITH RESERVATIONS THE 
FINDINGS OF THE INQUEST ON MONDAY 
THAT THEY WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED 
THE MOTHER OF THE MURDERED TEN YEAR 
OLD DAMILOLA TAYLOR HAS DIED OF A 
SUSPECTED HEART ATTACK GLORIA 
TAYLOR WAS FIFTY SEVEN SCOTLAND YARD SAID 
SHE COLLAPSED WHILE WALKING WITH 
HER HUSBAND IN LONDON 
HUNDREDS OF HOLIDAYMAKERS HAVE BEEN 
LEFT STRANDED AFTER A LOW COST 
AIRLINE WENT INTO LIQUIDATION 
OASIS HONG KONG AIRLINES WAS 
LAUNCHED EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO WITH 
FLIGHTS FROM LONDON TO HONG KONG 
PASSENGERS ARE BEING OFFERED 
TICKETS BY CATHAY PACIFIC NOW THE 
PARACHUTE REGIMENT IS BACK IN 
AFGHANISTAN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO THE 
PARAS FOUGHT THE TALEBAN IN SOME OF 
THE FIERCEST FIGHTING BRITISH 
TROOPS HAVE FACED IN DECADES NOW 
SIXTEEN AIR ASSAULT PARACHUTE BRIGADE 
HAS RETURNED TO HELMAND OUR 
CORRESPONDENT ALISTAIR LEITHEAD 
IS ON PATROL IN THE KANDAHAR 
PROVINCE WITH THE PARAS LOOKING AT 
HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE 
LAST TIME THE REGIMENT WERE OUT 
THERE THERE WHEN THE PARAS WERE HERE LAST TIME 
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SITTING ON 
THE ROOF OF PLACE LIKE THIS THE 
NATURE OF THE FIGHTING WAS VERY 
DIFFERENT THEY WERE BEING ATTACKED 
IN HELMAND PROVINCE DAY AND NIGHT 
THERE WERE WAVE AFTER WAVE OF 
TALEBAN ATTACKERS FIGHTERS WERE 
COMING UP TRYING TO DRIVE THEM OUT 
OF THE COUNTRY AND OVERRUN THEIR 
PACES THEY ARE THE FIRST UNIT TO 
COME BACK FOR A SECOND TOUR IN 
SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN AND NOW THE 
SITUATION IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT 
THE BRITISH FORCES HAVE GONE FROM 
BEING ON THE DEFENSIVE FROM BEING 
HOLED UP IN SMALL DOSES AND 
STRUGGLING EVEN TO GET SUPPLIED TO 
TAKING THE OFFENSIVE SMALL FACES 
SMALL BASES WHERE I AM AT THE 
MOMENT IS DISTRICT WHICH IS IN 
KANDAHAR PROVINCE JUST OVER THE 
BORDER FROM HELMAND IT HAS BEEN 
VERY QUIET IN THE LAST COUPLE OF 
WEEKS AND THE PARAS HAVE NOT FIRED 
A SHOT AS YET THEY HAVE BEEN 
RENOVATING SCHOOL THEY HAVE BEEN 
WORKING WITH THE LOCAL DISTRICT 
GOVERNOR HERE TO TRY TO BRING 
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS INTO PLACE 
BUT THEY KNOW THAT THERE IS A VERY 
GOOD CHANCE THAT IN THE COMING 
MONTHS THE FIGHTING WILL PICK UP 
IT IS STILL VERY EARLY DAYS IN 
TERMS OF THE FIGHTING SEASON IN 
SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN WE HAVE BEEN 
WALKING AROUND THE POPPY FIELDS 
THE OPIUM POPPIES ARE IN BLOOM AT 
THE MOMENT THEY WILL BE HARVESTED 
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AND 
THAT TAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF LABOUR 
OFTEN THE TALEBAN FOOTSOLDIERS ARE 
THE ONES WHO ARE HARVESTING OPIUM 
THE RAW MATERIAL FOR HEROIN WHEN 
THAT HARVEST IS OVER THEY'D EXPECT 
THINGS TO BECOME MORE BUSY AS THEY 
PUT IT ONCE AGAIN 
HERE ONE SOLUTION TO CAR PARKING 
PROBLEMS AND PAYING FOR PARKING 
PERMITS IS TO GET RID OF THE 
GREENERY IN THE FRONT GARDEN AND 
PAY IT OVER BUT FEARS THAT THIS 
INCREASES THE RISK OF FLOODING MEAN 
THAT THINGS ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE FOR 
THOSE PLANNING TO CONCRETE OVER 
THEIR CHRYSANTHEMUMS 
WHEN THERE IS A FLOOD DESTRUCTION 
AND MISERY ARE SURE TO FOLLOW BUT 
ARE THEY BEYOND OUR CONTROL OR 
HAVE OUR ACTIONS MADE THE MORE 
LIKELY FRONT GARDENS WHICH HAVE 
BEEN PAVED OVER ARE INCREASINGLY 
POPULAR IT CAN BE A CONVENIENT 
PLACE TO PARK THE CAR BUT WHEREAS 
GRASS OR SOIL IS GOOD AT ABSORBING 
WATER PAVING OR CONCRETE IS NOT 
IN FACT IT CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT 
OF WATER WHICH RUNS OFF BY UP TO 
FIFTY PER CENT THIS IS JUST ONE GARDEN AND 
THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM BUT IF MANY 
GARDENS IN THE SAME STREET DO THE 
SAME THING THAT WATER HAS GOT TO 
GO SOMEWHERE USUALLY INTO A DRAIN 
BUT SOMETIMES DRAINS CAN'T COPE 
SO IN ENGLAND PAVING YOUR FRONT 
GARDEN IS SET TO GET HARDER LATER 
THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU 
WILL NEED PLANNING PERMISSION THE 
ONLY EXCEPTION WILL BE SPECIALLY 
DESIGNED POROUS PAVING OR GRAVEL 
THIS LADY HAS JUST HAD HER FRONT 
GARDEN PAVED OVER 
PARKIN HAS GOT 
WORSE OVER THE LAST YEAR AND THAT 
MADE MY MIND UP PARKING BY BY GETTING IT DONE NOW SHE HAS 
AVOIDED THE PLANNING PERMISSION 
THAT OTHERS WILL SOON NEED IT IT MIGHT STOP SOME PEOPLE GOING AHEAD 
AND DOING IT THERE ARE PROBABLY A 
LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT WANT 
THE HASSLE IF YOU HIT A FEW 
BARRIERS A BIT OF RED TAPE YOU 
MIGHT THINK I WILL LEAVE IT THE 
ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY HAVE 
BEEN CALLING FOR TOUGHER REGULATION 
FOR YEARS AND THEY ARE DELIGHTED 
IT IS THE FIRST LEGISLATION THAT 
ACTUALLY DIRECTLY LINKS TO FRONT 
GARDENS GIVING PROPER PROTECTION 
THE THINGS BEFORE HAVE BEEN RATHER 
PERIPHERAL AND OPEN TO 
INTERPRETATION THIS SETS IT DOWN 
AND SAYS WE CAN PROTECT FRONT 
GARDENS FROM BEING SOLIDLY 
CONCRETED OVER 
THE SOCIETY 
BELIEVES THAT ANYONE DETERMINED TO 
TRANSFORM THEIR FRONT GARDEN SHOULD 
AT LEAST CONSIDER GRAVEL LIKE THE 
OWNER OF THIS DRIVEWAY 
THEY HAVE 
USED GRAVEL HERE WHICH IS GREAT 
THERE IS PLENTY OF GAPS ALLOWING 
THE WATER THROUGH INTO THE GROUND 
BELOW 
FLOODS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO BELOW STOP ALTOGETHER BUT MANY FIRMLY 
BELIEVE THEY WILL BE LESS LIKELY IF 
THERE ARE FEWER OF THESE 
NOW THE HOLLYWOOD STAR GEORGE 
CLOONEY HAS BEEN WOWING THE CROWDS 
AT THE PREMIERE OF HIS NEW FILM AS 
WELL AS STARRING IN THE MOVIE HE 
ALSO DIRECTED IT HE FOUND TIME TO 
SPEAK TO THE B. B. C. 
CERTAIN JOBS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE 
DOWN BY A MAN 
A BIG STRAPPING 
MAN 
THOUGH A GOOD LOOKING WAR HERO I I AM GLAD

AM HAPPY YOU'RE GLAD L. L. I AM GLAD YOU'RE GLAD 
YOU WANT TO 
PLAY DIRTY 
LEATHERHEAD IS A PLACE HERE IN THE 
U. K. 
I KNOW 
THE EXPLAIN TO US U. K. LEATHERHEADS WHAT DOES IT MEAN IT IT IS JUST DESCRIBING THE HELMETS THEY 
USED TO USE ALSO IN AMERICA IF 
YOU ARE A LEATHERHEAD YOU'RE NOT 
THE BRIGHTEST THAT SORT OF 
DESCRIBED MYSELF AND MY CO STAR 
PERFECTLY THE ONLY THING YOU HATE 
WORSE THAN A GUY MAKING A PLAY IS 
WHEN A GUY DOESN'T MAKE A PLAY WE 
HAVE SEEN EVERY SCENARIO POSSIBLE 
SO YOU JUST WANT A DIFFERENT VENUE 
AND THIS WAS A WORLD THAT I HAVE 
NOT EVER SEEN IN COLOUR SO I 
THOUGHT AT THE LEAST WE HAVE GOT A 
UNIQUE PLACE TO HOUSE IT 
RENE SAYS 
YOU'RE A SUPERHUMAN YOU ACT IN IT 
YOU DIRECT IT AND YOU PRODUCE IT AS 
WELL 
WELL I ACTUALLY DO NONE OF WELL THOSE THINGS I HIRE PEOPLE 
YOU TO 
ACT IN IT THOUGH 
YES I DO L. 
REALLY ENJOY WHAT I DO AND I AM 
LUCKY ENOUGH AT THIS TIME IN MY 
LIFE THAT I AM ABLE TO DO PROJECTS 
THAT I WANT TO DO SO AS LONG AS 
THAT HAPPENS YOU HAVE THE ENERGY 
YOU NEED 
MEN WOMEN MALE OR 
FEMALE YOUNG OLD EVERYBODY WANTS 
TO MEET GEORGE CLOONEY UNTIL UNTIL THEY DO AND THEN IT ALL GOES OUT 
OF THE WINDOW 
HOW DO YOU COPE WITH 
THAT PRESSURE THERE IS A CERTAIN 
LEVEL OF CELEBRITY WHICH NOWADAYS 
IS MORE THAN IT USED TO BE 
IT IS 
SORT OF OVERWHELMING THERE HE IS 
SORT OF A LACK OF A SHELL OF 
PRIVACY SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT 
AND USE IT IN PLACE IS WHERE IT CAN 
BE EFFECTIVE AS OPPOSED TO WHINING 
ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO PUT UP WITH 
YOUR LIFE IS GOOD
