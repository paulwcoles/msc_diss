WHO'S GONNA BUY THAT WHO DO YOU THINK WILL BUY IT 
A COLLECTOR OF VICTORIAN TOYS YEAH ABSOLUTELY OR A TREEN COLLECTOR 
OR SOMEONE WHO WANTS A BIT OF A CONVERSATION PIECE 
DOES IT MATTER IT'S GOT THAT SPLIT NO

LORRAINE COME AND HAVE A LOOK AT THIS SEE WHAT YOU THINK 
CHARLES WHAT IS IT IT SAYS IT'S A SMOKER'S BOX OR A SMOKER'S CABINET 
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS TYPE OF OBJECT TODAY IT'S NOT SO POPULAR WHY BECAUSE WE DON'T SMOKE 
WE'VE GOT THESE VERY NICE STYLISED PANELS 
WHICH ARE TYPICALLY TEXTURED HAMMERED COPPER 
WHICH IN THIS ORGANIC FREE FLOWING DESIGN IS VERY ART NOUVEAU 
IT'S FOLLOWING THAT TYPE OF STYLE RETURN TO NATURE 
THAT SELLS IT FOR ME DATEWISE WE'RE LOOKING AT NINETEEN FIFTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY 
PERHAPS A BIT EARLIER 
OPEN IT UP AND OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT THE VARIOUS DIVISIONS AND FITMENTS FOR YOUR PIPE REST 
FOR YOUR TOBACCO THE JAR AND COVER HERE IS THAT ORIGINAL 
NO IT'S NOT IT'S PROBABLY NINETEEN FORTIES FIFTIES 
THE CARCASS IS ACTUALLY OAK AS WELL 
I REALLY LIKE IT I JUST THINK THAT YOU COULD USE IT FOR SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS 
YOU CAN PUT DRINKS OR JEWELLERY IN THERE 
ARE YOU A DRINKER YOU COULDN'T PUT CIDER IN THERE THAT'S WHAT I DRINK 
OH CRIKEY 
I NOTICED ON HERE IT WAS SIXTY FIVE SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN BARGAIN 'EM DOWN 
TO MY MIND IT'S WORTH BETWEEN THIRTY AND FIFTY 
BUT IT COULD QUITE EASILY MAKE TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY 
IF YOU GOT THAT REACTION CHRIS MAYBE WE CAN BARGAIN 'EM DOWN AND SEE WHAT WE CAN GET FOR IT O. K. 
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS GO WITH YOUR GUT FEELINGS 
I SAID EARLIER ENJOY IT EXACTLY BUY WHAT YOU LIKE 
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT O. K. BRILLIANT 
AFTER HARD BARGAINING THEY COPPED THE CABINET FOR FORTY LET'S HOPE THEIR PROFITS DON'T GO UP IN SMOKE 
IS THIS YOUR LUCKY DAY WELL IT COULD BE IF YOU KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED AT A FAIR LIKE THIS

THEY'VE GOT A PIERCED HOLE THAT YOU COULD HANG FROM YOUR CHARM BRACELET 
OR FROM A CHAIN PENDANT ROUND YOUR NECK 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'D USE THEM FOR A SPECIAL WEDDING GIFT 
WHAT COULD BE NICER THAN TO GIVE THE BRIDE AND GROOM A GOOD LUCK MEMENTO OF THEIR SPECIAL DAY 
SO WHAT WOULD YOU PAY FOR THAT INTERESTING LITTLE WEDDING GIFT 
FIFTY WELL THESE TWO COULD BE YOURS FOR FIVE EACH GOOD LUCK 
IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME SOMETHING VERY HORSEY 
FROM THE EQUESTRIAN WORLD THAT SOUNDS IMPRESSIVE 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WEAR JODHPUR BOOTS AND YOU HAVE A HOOK ON 
IF I CAN GET ONE OUT I THINK YOU HOOK THIS ON AND PULL THE THING UP 
IS THAT A CORKSCREW OR A BOTTLE OPENER NO YOU WISH

ANYTHING TO DO WITH HORSES THERE'S ALWAYS A TOOL FOR GETTING A STONE OUT OF A HORSE'S HOOF OH YEAH

TIME'S UP LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE TEAMS HAVE BOUGHT AND HOW MUCH LEFTOVER LOLLY THERE IS 
FIRST UP FOR THE REDS THEY HOPE TO BE PLAYING WITH THE PROFITS 
WITH THIS VICTORIAN TREEN TOY BAGGED FOR THIRTY FIVE 
HOPEFULLY THE BOOT JACK WILL HAVE THE HORSEY CROWD AT AUCTION 
TROTTING AWAY AT TWENTY FIVE 
AND LAST UP THE BRASS MINER'S SNUFF TIN 
A PINCH AT FORTY QUID 
THAT WAS GOOD FUN WASN'T IT 
YEAH IT WAS WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE ITEM THE BOOT JACK 
WHY'S THAT I HAVE HORSES IT'S A HANDY THING AND I JUST LIKE IT 
IS IT GONNA MAKE YOU A DECENT PROFIT THOUGH YEAH I THINK SO 
WHAT ABOUT YOU PAUL THE BILBOQUET I THINK WE'LL MAKE SOME MONEY ON THAT 
HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND OVERALL ONE HUNDRED I'LL HAVE TWO HUNDRED THANK YOU 
TWO HUNDRED SNATCHED THAT'S NOT VERY POLITE 
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SPEND IT ON YOU NEVER KNOW MIGHT STUMBLE INTO SOMETHING YOU NEVER KNOW WITH YOU 
LET'S SEE WHAT THE BLUES BOUGHT 
HOPING TO LIGHT UP AT THEIR AUCTION 
THE BLUES KICKED OFF WITH THE SMOKING CABINET BOUGHT FOR FORTY

I KNOW WHAT WAS YOUR FAVOURITE ITEM CHRIS THE SMOKER'S CABINET 
I JUST LIKED IT WHEN I SAW IT WHAT ABOUT YOU LORRAINE 
INITIALLY IT WAS THE GAS MASK BUT ON REFLECTION I'M A BIT 
MAYBE IT WASN'T A GREAT PURCHASE SO I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH CHRIS 
IT'S THE SMOKER'S CABINET YEAH BUT WE THINK THE FIGURINE WILL MAKE THE MOST MONEY 
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WORKED OUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE PLEASE 
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE IT'S A LOT TO SPEND WE'LL HAVE TO SEND SECURITY TO GUARD YOU 
ARE YOU GONNA BOUNCE OFF YEAH I'M HEADING OUT TO THE FRESH AIR 
AND REACHING FOR THE SKIES 
AREN'T THEY MAGNIFICENT 
I'VE VISITED LOTS OF MUSEUMS MANY BASED AROUND PRIVATE COLLECTIONS 
BUT HOW DO YOU TURN AN INDIVIDUAL'S PASSION FOR PARTICULAR OBJECTS 
INTO A SUCCESSFUL MUSEUM 
HERE AT TANGMERE THEY TOOK A MISERABLE DISUSED R. A. F. HUT 
AND IT'S NOW THE MOST FANTASTIC MUSEUM OF AVIATION HISTORY 
SO ALAN HOW DOES A MUSEUM LIKE THIS GET STARTED 
USUALLY IT'S ONE OR A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO GET TOGETHER WITH A PASSION FOR A SUBJECT AREA 
AND THEY START TO POOL TOGETHER SOME ITEMS AND BITS AND PIECES 
THEY FIND THEIR PASSION SPREADS WIDER AND WIDER TO OTHER PEOPLE 
AND THEY GROW AND GROW WITH THE COLLECTION OF ITEMS THEY'VE GOT 
WHERE DO YOUR EXHIBITS COME FROM BECAUSE WE'RE A CHARITABLE TRUST 
AND OUR ONLY INCOME IS WHAT PEOPLE PAY WHEN THEY COME TO VISIT US MY BUDGET IS TINY 
ALL OUR ITEMS ARE DONATIONS BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 
DONATIONS BY PEOPLE OF ARTEFACTS THEY FOUND IN THEIR LOFT 
OR HAVE TREASURED THEMSELVES BUT WANTED A MORE PERMANENT HOME 
AND HAVE GIVEN THEM TO THE MUSEUM 
IS THERE ONE PARTICULAR OBJECT THAT PULLS AT YOUR HEARTSTRINGS LET'S GO THIS WAY 
THIS UNIFORM REMINDS ME OF A TYPICAL STORY OF THE PERIOD 
WHEN WE RECEIVED THE UNIFORM IT WAS NICE THAT IT WAS IN GOOD CONDITION 
AND PARTICULARLY THE BUTTONS 
THIS IS A STANDARD R. A. F. BUTTON WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN AS PER REGULATIONS 
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THAT ON THE BREAST POCKET IS A ROYAL CANADIAN AIR FORCE BUTTON 
AND THE YOUNG LADIES USED TO HAVE A SLIGHTLY ILLEGAL SITUATION 
OF ADOPTING A BOYFRIEND'S BUTTON ON TO THEIR UNIFORM 
THAT CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A CANADIAN LIAISON 
IT'S NO WONDER IT'S YOUR FAVOURITE STORY ALAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AND I MUST FLY TO THE AUCTION 
WE'VE BUZZED OFF TO MOLD IN NORTH WALES 
I WANT TO HEAR WHAT OUR AUCTIONEER THINKS OF TODAY'S BARGAINS

NOW THE GAS MASK PERSONALLY I HATE THESE THINGS 
WHAT DID THEY BUY THAT FOR THEY RATHER HOPED THERE'S A SMELL ABOUT HERE TEN IF WE'RE LUCKY 
THEY PAID FIFTEEN BUT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO VALUE 
IT MIGHT MAKE A POUND COUPLE OF DAD'S ARMY CHAPS LEFT OVER 
WE'VE SEEN THEM THEY GO TO REVIVAL MEETINGS 
AND PUT GAS MASKS ON AND RUN AROUND WITH RIFLES THAT'S WHAT WE WANT HERE 
HAVE YOU GOT ANY ROUND HERE WE'LL HAVE TO SEARCH FOR ONE YEAH SEND OUT A SEARCH PARTY 
LET'S SEE THE BLUES' BONUS BUY 
LORRAINE CHRIS YOU SPENT A PATHETIC AMOUNT OF MONEY SIXTY FIVE 
SO YOU GAVE CHARLES TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE NOW WHAT DID HE SPEND ALL THAT CASH ON 
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE SPENT A MASSIVE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE ON 
WE SPENT VERY LITTLE AT THE FAIR BUT I THOUGHT I'D SPEND SOME MONEY 
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL WHAT IS IT A SILVER VINAIGRETTE 
OVAL FORM IT'S HALLMARKED FOR BIRMINGHAM ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
IF YOU WERE A LADY IN THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY YOU'D HAVE HAD THAT ON YOU TO KEEP YOU SMELLING NICE 
TWO HUNDRED SEVEN YEARS AGO O. K. SHE LIKES IT CHARLES SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE LIKES IT

HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR IT I LIKED IT AND SPENT A WHOPPING ONE HUNDRED

OLD HANSON'S PAID ONE HUNDRED AND SEES A PROFIT IN IT 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY ABOUT THAT IF HE SEES A PROFIT I DON'T 
WE HAVE TWO CLEAR DIFFERENCES OF OPINION AND SOMEBODY WILL BE RIGHT IN THE AUCTION YES THEY WILL 
THINK ABOUT A BARREL IT HAS THE SAME SIZED TOP AND BOTTOM 
BUT THIS ONE DEFINITELY HAS A BIGGER BOTTOM THAN IT HAS A TOP 
IT WAS NEVER MADE TO DELIVER WINE OR SPIRITS OR BEER 
TO PUBS WHICH WOULD BE THE TRADITIONAL BARREL USAGE BECAUSE THIS THING WAS ONLY USED ON A SHIP 
IT'S A GROG TUB 
IT'S THE THING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON EVERY ROYAL NAVY SHIP UNTIL THE NINETEEN FIFTIES OR NINETEEN SIXTIES 
WHEN THEY SCRAPPED THE DAILY TOT OF RUM 
EVERY DAY ALL THE SHIP'S COMPANY WOULD LINE UP 
THE QUARTERMASTER WOULD LADLE OUT THIS HIGH OCTANE RUM AND THAT WOULD BE THEIR DAILY TOT 
AND IT'S A MAGNIFICENT EXAMPLE MADE OF TEAK 
BEAUTIFULLY BOUND IN BRASS 
BUT THE BEST FEATURE ARE THESE HINGES 
LOOK AT THOSE LOVELY SCROLLY RATHER ARCHITECTURAL HINGES BUT HUGE PROPORTIONS 
IT'S GOT A GREAT CLASP ON THE FRONT BECAUSE AT THE END OF PIPING GROG 
THE QUARTERMASTER WOULD PUT A BIG PADLOCK ON THAT SO THOSE NAUGHTY SAILORS DIDN'T NICK SOME MORE RUM 
IT'S A FASCINATING PIECE OF SOCIAL HISTORY 
IT WOULD REMIND SERVICE PERSONNEL PERHAPS OF HAPPY DAYS 
AND IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT YOU COULD LEAVE IT OPEN IN YOUR HALLWAY AND PUT STICKS AND UMBRELLAS IN IT 
EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED IS THE ESTIMATE BUT WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT IT'S REALLY WORTH IN THE AUCTION
