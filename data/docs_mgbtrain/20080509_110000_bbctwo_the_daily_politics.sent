WELCOME TO THE DAILY POLITICS ON 
FRIDAY GORDON BROWN MANAGES TO PUT 
ON A BRAVE FACE THIS MORNING AS ONE 
POLL PUTS THEM AT THEIR LOWEST 
LEVEL OF SUPPORT SINCE POLLS BIG TEST SOON THE 
CREWE AND NANTWICH ELECTION 
HARRIET HARMAN TALKS ABOUT HEM 
LOSING THIS NORMALLY SAFE SEAT TO 
THE OPPOSITION 
ONE SURVEY OUT TODAY SUGGESTS WE 
DRIVE AND FLY MORE THAN WITH 
THE ECONOMY IN TROUBLE HAVE THE 
MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES GIVEN UP ON 
THE ENVIRONMENT 
THE LONDON ASSEMBLY MEETS THIS 
MORNING FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
BORIS JOHNSON WAS CROWNED AS MAYOR 
AS HE MET HIS NEW YORK COUNTERPART 
THERE WERE PROTESTERS OUTSIDE 
AGAINST THE FIRST B. N. P. ASSEMBLY 
MEMBER SO HOW THE ASSEMBLY 
DEAL WITH THE B. N. P. 
GYLES WILL HAVE ALL THE TOP STORIES 
OF THE WEEK IN TOP OF THE POLITICAL 
POPS 
WITH ME TODAY FOR THE PROGRAMME ARE 
CHUCK HUNT AND DANIEL FINKELSTEIN 
OF THE TIMES CHUKA UMUNNA 
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF 
DEMONSTRATORS GATHERED OUTSIDE CITY 
HALL TO PROTEST AT THE ELECTION OF 
THE BRITISH NATIONAL PARTY RICHARD 
BARNBROOK WAS ELECTED TO THE 
ASSEMBLY LAST WEEK THE PROTESTS 
HAVEN'T BEEN CONFINED TO THE OPEN 
AIR THE NEW MAYOR BORIS JOHNSON 
HAS REFUSED TO SPEAK TO THE NEW B. N. P. 
MEMBER AND DUVAL THE LEADER 
OF THE EIGHT STRONG MEMBER GROUP 
SAID IF CIVIL SERVANTS REFUSE TO 
WORK WITH HIM I EXPECT THEY'LL BE 
DIVIDED IN THEIR POSITION THAT 
SEEMS TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARY 
STATEMENT THAT A DEMOCRATICALLY 
ELECTED POLITICIAN SHOULDN'T 
NECESSARILY HAVE THE RIGHT TO CIVIL 
SERVICE SUPPORT DO YOU AGREE WITH 
THAT 
I THINK IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE THAT BECAUSE I AM NOT SURE HOW IT WILL 
WORK IN TERMS OF THE CIVIL SERVANTS 
AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE EMPLOYEES OF 
THE GLA L. AM NOT SURE ON THAT ONE 
FOR ME THE MAIN THING IS WITH THE 
B. N. P. YOU CAN'T IGNORE THEM OR FREEZE 
THEM OUT YOU NEED TO TAKE THEM ON 
AND WIN THE ARGUMENT DON'T FORGET 
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE CHOSE ON THE 
VOTE FOR THIS GUY IN LONDON WHICH 
IS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT BECAUSE I 
THINK LONDON AT THE MOMENT IS MORE 
CONFIDENT THAN IT EVER HAS BEEN 
ABOUT ITS MULTICULTURALISM YOU 
CAN'T IGNORE THESE PEOPLE OUT OF 
THE TAKE THEM ON AND WIN THE 
ARGUMENTS 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND VOTES FOR HIM ARGUMENTS YOU'RE SAYING IF YOU DO FREEZE HIM 
OUT YOU'RE ALMOST PLAYING INTO HIS 
HANDS 
IN A WAY YOU ARE YOU'VE HANDS GOT TO LOOK AT WHY ARE THOSE 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE VOTING FOR HIM AND 
YOU NEED TO TALK TO THE REASONS 
THAT THEY VOTED FOR HIM JUST 
PRETENDING IT HASN'T HAPPENED OR 
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S SOLUTION IT'S 
ALWAYS A THING ABOUT THE FAR RIGHT 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM ON ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S CALAMITOUS HE HAS BEEN 
ELECTED ONE REASON IS IT CREATES A 
RALLYING POINT FOR EXTREME GROUPS 
YOU CAN SEE THE RELIGIOUS CENTRE 
COVERING NINETY PER CENT OF POLITICS IN LONDON 
BEING SQUEEZED OUT BY A VIOLENT 
ALTERCATION BETWEEN THE FAR RIGHT 
AND FAR LEFT ALTHOUGH IT WAS 
INTERESTING TO ME IN THOSE PICTURES 
CAN IS REALLY WHAT YOU HAD HALF A 
DOZEN PEOPLE WITH PLACARDS WHICH I 
FIND REASSURING BECAUSE I THINK THE 
REAL SOLUTIONS ARE TO ONE EXTENT 
OF COURSE MAKING SURE THAT YOU 
ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT LED THE B. N. P. 
TO RISE BUT THE EERT IS AVOIDING 
OTHER IS AVOIDING THINGS THAT GIVE 
THEM PUBLICITY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND THOUGH 
ENOUGH TO GET THEM ELECTED ISN'T A 
HUGE NUMBER OF VOTE 
IS BORIS 
TAKING THE RIGHT TACTIC WHEN HE 
SAYS HE'S REFUSING TO SPEAK TO 
THEM 
BORIS HAS TO MAKE SURE HE'S THEM SEEN AS A FIGUREHEAD FOR 
MULTICULTURAL LONDON THERE WAS A 
QUESTION OVER THAT IN THE ELECTION 
I THINK IN SOME WAYS IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN EASIER FOR KEN LIVINGSTONE TO 
DEAL WITH BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T HAVE 
HAD THAT PRESSURE SO BORIS HAS TO 
SHOW THAT THERE ARE ISSUES FOR 
BORIS TO DEAL WITH AT THE SAME TIME 
HE HAS A LOT TO PROVE ON THAT FRONT 
I THINK LOT OF PEOPLE REMAIN TO 
BE CONVINCED IN TERMS OF HIS 
COMMITMENT TO MULTICULTURALISM AND 
BEING AT EASE WITH ALL OF LONDON'S 
DIFFERENT FACES AND HE HAS SAID 
THINGS AND WHATEVER CONTEXT THEY'RE 
PUT IN FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY'RE 
UNACCEPTABLE HE HIMSELF HAS 
ACKNOWLEDGED HE HAS BRIDGES TO 
BUILD AND HE SURE HAS BECAUSE 
THERE ARE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN 
THE COMMUNITY I AM A PART OF WHO 
HAVE NO TIME FOR HIM 
WE'LL SEE HOW 
THAT PLAYS OUT 
A WEEK AGO THE LABOUR PARTY 
SUFFERED ITS WORST LOCAL ELECTION 
RESULTS FOR A GENERATION IF GORDON 
BROWN THOUGHT IT COULDN'T GET ANY 
WORSE THEN PERHAPS HE SHOULD THINK 
AGAIN BECAUSE IN TWO WEEKS' TIME 
THE VOTERS WILL GO TO THE POLLS IN 
CREWE AND NANTWICH FOR THEIR BY 
ELECTION IN NORMAL TIMES THIS 
WOULD BE A SAFE LABOUR SEAT THE 
VETERAN LABOUR M. P. GWYNETH DUN 
WITTY'S FUNERAL YESTERDAY WAS HELD 
WITH A MAJORITY OF OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND AT 
THE LAST ELECTION BUT THESE AREN'T 
NORMAL TIMES AND THE OPPOSITION 
HAVE DESCENDED ON THE CONSTITUENCY 
NICK CLEGG AND GEORGE OSBORNE WERE 
IN CREWE TODAY DAVID CAMERON WAS 
THERE ON TUESDAY AND GYLES HAS 
ALSO BEEN THERE TO EXPLORE WHETHER 
GORDON BROWN'S NIGHTMARE COULD COME 
TRUE TRUE DESPITE CREWE'S INDUSTRIAL PAST AND 
ITS TRADITIONAL WORKING CLASS 
LABOUR VOTE THE CONSTITUENCY OF 
CREWE AND NANTWICH IS MUCH MORE 
LIKE THIS LEAFY CHESHIRE RURAL 
COUNTRYSIDE THIS IS THE ANCIENT 
VILLAGE OF AUDLUM MENTIONED IN THE 
DOOMSDAY BOOK IT HAS CHESHIRE'S 
VILLAGE OF THE GRIE NOW TWENTY THREE PER CENT OR SO 
OF THE POPULATION WOULD LIKE TO BE 
OFFICIALLY WELSH IT SEEMS THAT 
BEING ENGLISH IS NO LONGER 
FINANCIALLY VIABLE THE VILLAGE 
POLL WAS A BIT OF A LARK BUT MANY 
WORRYS ARE AT THE HEART OF 
FRUSTRATIONS OUTSIDE CREWE IT'S 
PLAYING INTO TORY HANDS 
THE BUS SERVICES THE HOSPITAL 
PAYING FOR THE HOSPITALS AND WHAT 
ELSE WAS IT OH PRESCRIPTIONS 
WHICH WALES GET FREE WE DON'T 
DON'T KNOW WHY L. DON'T THINK 
LABOUR WOULD HAVE CHANCE AROUND 
HERE THEY DON'T REALLY 
SO IS THAT 
MONEY WORRIES A BLOSSOMING TORY 
PARTY OR GORDON BROWN 
I THOUGHT HE 
WAS GOOD AS A CHANCELLOR BUT 
SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG NOW 
SOMETHING HAS GONE MISSING IT'S IT'S THE SAME IN NANTWICH THE FLOWERS 
ARE BLOOMING BUT FAITH IN LABOUR 
IS WILTING 
OUR WATER BILLS OUR 
COUNCIL TAXS I MEAN FORTNIGHTLY 
EMPTYING THE BINS WE WERE ALL 
WE SEEM TO PAY MORE FOR LESS AND 
LESS MY MAIN THING I THINK WOULD 
BE CRIME LABOUR'S THING ON CRIME 
AT THE MOMENT IS THEY DON'T SEEM TO 
HAVE ANY ANSWER YOU KNOW WHY 
SHOULD YOUTHS AND YOBS BE ABLE TO 
WRECK YOUR PROPERTY AND YOU PAY FOR 
YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU GO OUT AND TRY 
AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THERE THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A LOT BETWEEN 
THE LABOUR OR THE CONSERVATIVES 
BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF THEY CAN 
GET US OUT OF THIS MESS WE'RE IN 
THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER IS JUST 
CASHING IN ON THE MOMENT AT THE 
MOMENT WITH THE POOR RESPONSE TO 
GORDON BROWN BUT THEN ACTUALLY 
COMING UP WITH ANY ANSWERS COULD COULD THAT MEAN THAT THE LIB DEMS GET A 
FLOWERING OF SUPPORT IN TWO WEEKS 
IT DEPENDS WHAT HAPPENS IN CREWE 
ITSELF THE BEDROOM OF LABOUR'S SO 
FAR WINNING VOTE HERE STAN AND 
ANDREW RESIDENTS FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
ANDREW RESIDENTS FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS POPPED INTO BEACIOUS THEY THINK 
THE POPULATION IS CHANGING AND 
LABOUR IS FACING A CREW CUT 
A LOT 
OF THE INDUSTRY IS GONE WHERE IT 
ALWAYS HAS BEEN LABOUR THERE'S NO 
INDUSTRY HERE ANYMORE NOW WE HAVE 
ONLY GOT ONE MAJOR TOWN EMPLOYEE 
THAT'S BENTLEY NOW THERE'S NOTHING 
HERE NOW 
WHATEVER THERE HAS BEEN A 
EVACUATION I HAVE VOTED LABOUR 
WEMBLEY'S BY ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN A 
LITTLE BIT IFFY ALWAYS MOVED THAT 
WAY TO LABOUR 
WHERE MIGHT YOU 
END UP IF YOU DID SWITCH YOUR VOTE 
TORY 
A STRAIGHT SWITCH 
OH YES TORY IF THE DANGERS OF A TORY VICTORY 
WERE ON GORDON BROWN'S RADAR AND I 
THINK THEY PROBABLY ARE THEN HE 
MIGHT FIND HIMSELF RETREATING TO 
CREWE AND NANTWICH ANYWAY EVEN IF 
HE LOSES IT'S AN OLD GOVERNMENT 
NUCLEAR BUNKER INSIDE HE CAN 
HUNKER DOWN FOR A LOOK AT 
NEXT CAN HE SAVE HIS PREMIERSHIP 
OR IS IT GOING TO JUST BLOW UP IN 
HIS FIRST JOINING US IS THE DEPUTY 
LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY HARRIET 
HARMAN WELCOME JOINING BY THE 
PEOPLE THAT HE SPOKE TO IN CREWE 
THINGS AREN'T LOOKING GOOD FOR YOU 
OUR JOB IS TO CONVINCE THEM THAT 
OUR CANDIDATE IN DUNCAN JAMES 
DUNWITGR IS RIGHT FOR CREWE IT'S IT'S AN UPHILL BATTLE THOUGH 
WE'RE NOT 
COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT BUT WE'RE VERY 
DETERMINED INDEED AS WELL AS THE 
LIST OF OTHER LUMINARIES GOING UP 
FROM OTHER PARTIES I MYSELF AM 
GOING UP TO CREWE AND LOVELY 
NANTWICH MONDAY 
DO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE 
THIS IS A BY ELECTION ON NATIONAL 
ISSUES THE TORIES HAVE TRIED TO 
MAKE IT A REFERENDUM ON GORDON 
BROWN AND THE TEN P. TAX ISSUE DO YOU 
ACKNOWLEDGE IT IS MORE ABOUT GORDON 
BROWN THAN LOCAL ELECTIONS WHAT WHAT THE BIELECTION IS ABOUT WILL BE 
ABOUT WHAT THE LOCAL PEOPLE IN 
CREWE AND NANTWICH DECIDE TO MAKE A 
PRIORITY FOR THEIR VOTES IT'S FOR 
THEM TO SAY WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE 
AND CERTAINLY THE QUESTION OF 
FAMILY FINANCES IS A PROBLEM THAT I 
PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT FOOD 
PRICES AND THE COST OF PETROL BUT 
THERE IS ANOTHER THE QUESTION OF 
WHO IS GOING TO BE THEIR 
REPRESENTATIVE WHO IS GOING TO 
SPEAK UP FOR CREWE AND PUT CREWE 
AND NANTWICH STRONGLY AND FIRMLY ON 
THE MAP AND MAKE THE DEMANDS OF THE 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT DELIVER FOR THE 
PEOPLE THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES 
AROUND REGENERATION TRANSPORT 
THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN FORWARD WE 
THINK TAMSIN IS A STRONG GUTSY 
CANDIDATE AND WE'LL BE THE CHOICE 
OF PEOPLE IN CREWE AND NANTWICH IF IF SHE IS ELECTED SHE COULD END UP 
HAVING TO BE GUTSY AGAINST HER OWN 
PARTY'S POLICIES BECAUSE ACCORDING 
TO GILES AND THE PEOPLE HE SPOKE TO 
THE PEOPLE IN CREWE WERE WORRIED 
ABOUT THE TEN P. TAX THE ECONOMY 
POST OFFICE CLOSURES ABOUT 
IMMIGRATION WE HEARD THERE ABOUT 
CRIME THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT 
LIE AT GORDON BROWN'S DOOR 
WELL I 
THINK THAT TAMSIN HAS ALREADY SAID 
THAT REMINDED PEOPLE THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS SAID THAT WE ARE 
GOING TO ADDRESS THOSE PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE LOST OUT BECAUSE OF THE 
ADJUSTMENTS AROUND THE TEN P. RATE OF 
TAX AS FAR AS CRIME IS CONCERNED 
WE'RE COMMITTED AS A GOVERNMENT TO 
PUT MORE POLICE ON THE BEAT IN THE 
COUNTRY BUT OBVIOUSLY SHE'LL BE AN 
M. P. DEMANDING ABSOLUTE IMPROVEMENTS 
ON CRIME LAW AND ORDER IN NANTWICH 
SO IT'S REALLY GOT TO BE THE LOCAL 
CHAMPION MAKING SURE THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT DELIVERS FOR PEOPLE IN 
HER CONSTITUENCY 
IF YOU DO LOSE 
HOW BAD DOES IT HAVE TO BE BEFORE 
THE BACKBENCHES GET REALLY RESTLESS 
AND THE PARTY STARTS TO QUESTION 
WHETHER GORDON BROWN IS THE RIGHT 
MAN TO LEAD THEM 
WE'RE ONLY AT THE 
OUTSET OF THE CAMPAIGN L. AM NOT 
GOING TO TALK ABOUT US LOSING IT 
WE THINK WE HAVE A GOOD CANDIDATE 
SHE HAS A GOOD LOCAL MANIFESTO AND 
WILL BE PUTTING THAT FORWARD AS 
FAR AS BACKBENCHERS IN THE LABOUR 
PARTY IS CONCERNED I THINK WE KNOW 
THERE IS A PEOPLE STORM WE DON'T 
MAKE ANY BONES ABOUT THE RESULTS 
LAST WEEK THEY WERE BAD 
DISAPPOINTING RESULTS FOR LABOUR 
BUT JUST AS WE KNOW THERE IS AN 
ECONOMIC STORM BECAUSE OF THE 
GLOBAL FINANCIAL SITUATION AND 
WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT BRITAIN'S 
ECONOMY WILL GET THROUGH IT THERE 
IS A POLITICAL FORM BUT WE'RE 
CONFIDENT WE'LL GET THROUGH IT AS A 
GOVERNMENT AND A PARTY 
YOU SAY YOU 
DON'T WANT TO START TALKING ABOUT 
LOSING BY ELECTIONS AND SO FOR BUT 
IF THE POLL IN TODAY'S SUN IS 
ANYTHING TO GO BY THINGS AREN'T 
LOOKING GOOD AT ALL IT SHOWS 
LABOUR IS ON TWENTY THREE POINTS THE 
CONSERVATIVES THEY HAVE PUT ON FORTY NINE 
POINTS THAT GIVES THE TORIES A TWENTY SIX 
POINT LEAD WHICH THE SUN SAYS 
HASN'T BEEN SEEN SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT I I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE SERIOUSLY 
WHEN PEOPLE CAST THEIR VOTES L. DO 
RECOGNISE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE 
RESULTS OF LAST THURSDAY'S 
ELECTIONS BUT I ALSO THINK THAT 
IT'S VERY BAD GOVERNMENT TO JUST 
GET INTO THE POSITION OF LOOKING 
OVER OUR SHOULDER AND CONTEMPLATING 
OPINION POLLS WE'VE GOT A JOB TO 
DO TO UNDERSTAND PEOPLE'S CONCERNS 
WHICH THEY EXPRESSED AT THE BALLOT 
BOXES LAST THURSDAY AND NEED TO 
FOCUS ON COMMUNITY SERVICES AND 
HOSPITALS SCHOOLS AND POLICING 
ONCE THE GOVERNMENT STARTS TO THINK 
OF ITS OWN FATE RATHER THAN THE 
PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY THAT IS 
WRONG FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO DO 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT ISN'T ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU'RE ACCUSED OF DOING 
YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO LISTEN YOU 
LIST ALL THESE THINGS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE 
CONCERNED ABOUT BUT THE PEOPLE 
DON'T GET THAT IMPRESSION JOHN 
DENMAN HE SAYS VOTERS ARE CONFUSED 
ABOUT WHAT WE STAND FOR THE 
MESSAGE YOU'RE REACHING DOESN'T 
SEEM TO BE REACHING THE VOTERS WE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE LIVING IN 
CITIES TOWNS AND VILLAGES IN THE 
SOUTH ARE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR LOCAL 
ECONOMY GROWING THEY'RE ABLE TO BE 
SECURE IN THEIR JOBS THAT THE 
INTEREST RATES ARE SUCH THAT THEY 
CAN PAY THEIR MORTGAGES AND WE'VE 
GOT TO FOCUS ON 
DETERMINATION TO DELIVER FOR PEOPLE 
IN THIS COUNTRY WE'RE GOING TO BE 
RESOLUTE AND NOT GET INTO A TUSH 
LANCE BECAUSE OF THE OPINION POLLS 
WE HAVE TO LISTEN WHAT PEOPLE SAID 
AT THE BALLOT BOX THEN GET ON WIT 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING 
IS THERE 
ANYTHING CONCRETE YOU'RE DOING TO 
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES YOU MENTIONED 
MORTGAGES THAT'S COMPLETELY OUT OF 
YOUR CONTROL IT'S UNDER THE 
CONTROL OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE 
BUILDING SOCIETIES AND BANKS THERE 
IS NOTHING YOU CAN 
IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO THERE EFFECTIVELY YOU MENTIONED THE TEN P. 
TAX 
NOT TRUE THAT THERE IS TAX NOTHING WE CAN DO 
YOU'RE STILL NOT 
CLEAR HOW YOU CAN COMPENSATE PEOPLE 
IT'S NOT TRUE WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING 
ABOUT INTEREST RATES WE HAVE TO 
MAKE SURE WE KEEP INFLATION DOWN 
THAT IS WHY REALLY QUITE DIFFICULT 
DECISIONS WERE MADE ABOUT PUBLIC 
SECTOR PAY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE 
THAT WE ENCOURAGE THE LENDERS TO 
OFFER PEOPLE GOOD RATES IF THEY ARE 
COMING OFF FIXED RATES 
YOU CAN'T 
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
ALSO WE HAVE 
TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE ADVICE IF 
THEY DO GET INTO TROUBLE AND IF 
THEY FALL BEHIND IN THEIR MORTGAGE 
THEY DON'T GET RIPPED OFF BY THE 
MORTGAGE LENDERS EXACTING A DEAL 
THAT IS UP FAIR WE HAVE TO LEND 
WE HAVE MADE SURE THAT THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND MAKE SURE THAT THE LENDERS 
KEEP LENDING TO FIRST TIME BUYERS 
THE DIFFICULTY HAS BEEN FOR PEOPLE 
TO SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT ACTION WE 
HAVE TAKEN AND ARE TAKING AT 
NATIONAL LEVEL 
THEY WOULD ALSO SAY 
THAT THE REASON WE ARE IN THIS 
PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE IS 
BECAUSE AS THE GOVERNMENT YOU LET 
DEBT GET OUT OF CONTROL 
THAT IS 
NOT TRUE IF YOU LOCK AT THE 
FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR ECONOMY IT'S 
STILL GROWING WE EXPECT IT TO 
CONTINUE TO GROW WE ALSO EXPECT 
THERE TO BE MORE JOBS IN THE LABOUR 
MARKET WE DON'T HAVE MASS 
UNEMPLOYMENT WE HAVE VACANCIES IN 
THE ECONOMY THAT MEANS ALTHOUGH 
THERE IS DIFFICULT TURBULENCE WE 
ARE CONFIDENT THAT PEOPLE CAN GET 
THROUGH IT OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE 
WORRIED WE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT 
THEY ARE WORRIED IT'S UNCERTAIN 
TIMES IT'S OUR JOB TO TAKE THE 
ACTION TO STABLISE THE ECONOMY AND 
TO REASSURE PEOPLE THAT WE WILL 
COME OUT THE OTHER END OF THIS A A QUICK COMMENT FROM YOU HOW DO YOU 
PUT LABOUR'S CHANCES 
THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN 
OPINION POLLS BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST 
A POLLED VERSION OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE 
THINKING WHAT THIS SHOWS IS THAT 
THE LABOUR PARTY ISN'T DOING VERY 
WELL AND THERE IS PROBLEM IN THE 
QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU LISTEN AS 
GORDON BROWN SAID OR WHETHER YOU 
LEAD DO YOU PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN 
THERE IS LOT TO BE SAID FOR THIS 
AND KEEP PLOUGHING ON AND SAY WE 
CAN'T TAKE ON BOARD A LOT OF 
INFORMATION I DON'T THINK THAT 
GORDON BROWN HAS CHOSEN YET L. 
THINK THAT HARRIET HARMAN'S LUCID 
EXPECTATION OF LABOUR'S POSITION 
SHOWS THEY HAVEN'T SHOWN 
I THINK WHAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS 
TO DO IS PUT WHAT IT'S DOING IN AN 
EMOTIONAL CONTEXT THAT PEOPLE CAN 
ASSOCIATE AND UNDERSTAND ONE OF 
THE PROBLEMS OF HAVING BEEN IN 
POWER SO LONG IS OFTEN YOU DRIFT 
INTO MANAGEMENT SPEAK AS IF YOU ARE 
MANAGING BIG COMPANY BARACK 
OBAMA HAS BEEN GOOD AT DOING THAT 
IN THE UNITED STATES PUTTING IT 
INTO CONTEXT UNTIL YOU HAVE SORTED 
THAT THAT OUT YOU CAN'T MOVE ON TO 
POLICY THERE ARE THINGS THAT NEED 
TO A. I. B. DRESSED FROM POLICY POINT 
OF VIEW TO WIN PEOPLE BACK 
WE WILL 
BE TALKING TO THE OPPOSITION 
PARTIES ABOUT THE CREWE AND 
NANTWITCH BY ELECTION PARTIES TEN 
CANDIDATES ARE THE FLYING BRICK 
THE MONSTER RAVING LOONY PARTY 
DAVID ROBERTS ENGLISH DEMOCRATS 
ELIZABETH SHENTEN LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS ROBERT SMITH THE GREEN 
PAPER PAUL IT HUROGOOD CUT TAX ON 
PETROL AND DIESEL AND MARK WAITE 
FOR THE INDEPENDENTS 
DO YOU REMEMBER THOSE GREENER DAYS 
WHEN THE THREE MAIN PARTIES WERE 
TRYING TO OUTDO EACH OTHER TO PROVE 
THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL CREDENTIALS 
BACK THEN IT WAS FLIGHTS AND 
PUNISHING GAS GUZZLERS AS THE 
ECONOMY TAKES A TURN FOR THE WORST 
IT SEEMS THE FIRST POLICIES TO BE 
THRON OUT ARE THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
ONES THROWN OUT ARE THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL ONES GARETH HAS THE 
GREEN IDEAS THAT ARE LITTERING 
WESTMINSTER 
IT HAS TO BE SAID THAT WESTMINSTER BRITAIN'S REPUTATION AS A NATION OF 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS HAS TAKEN A 
BATTERING WITH A NEW REPORT FROM 
THE OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS 
THEY ARE BASICALLY SAYING THEY ARE 
FAILING TO GO GREEN CAR OWNERSHIP 
IS UP BY FIVE MILLION OVER THE LAST 
DECADE AIR TRAVEL FIFTY FOUR MILLION AIR 
JOURNEYS BEING MADE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND ONE 
AND TWO THOUSAND SIX WHICH MEANS OUR CARBON 
FOOTPRINT HAS GONE UP SEVERAL SHOE 
SIZES ADD TO THAT THE MATTER OF 
VEHICLE EXCISE DUTY AND FUEL DUTY 
INCREASES THEY HAVE BEEN 
CRITICISED BY THE CONSERVATIVES AS 
BEING FAR MORE TO DO WITH RAISING 
REVENUE AS GETTING RID OF EMISSIONS 
THAT IS POLLUTION ARE WE BETTER 
AT RECYCLING RECYCLING RATESS HAVE 
REMAINED STEADY THREE OUT OF THE 
THIRTEEN U. K. REGIONS ONLY RECYCLE MORE 
THAN A THIRD OF THE RUBBISH THEY 
COLLECT THAT IS PRETTY BAD SO 
WHAT PROPOSALS ARE THERE THERE HAD 
BEEN PROPOSALS TO PAY AS YOU THROW 
TO INCREASE THE RATE OF RECYCLING 
THIS VERY BEEN CRITICISED BY JUST 
ABOUT EVERYBODY HOW DO YOU GO 
GREEN AND NOT LOSE YOUR ELECTORATE 
JENNI I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOMEONE 
WITH YOU WHO MIGHT HAVE SOME 
SUGGESTIONS 
WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTIONS JOINED BY THE CONSERVATIVE M. P. JOHN 
GUMMER WHO CO SHARED THE 
CONSERVATIVE'S QUALITY OF LIFE TASK 
FORCE SO ARE POLITICIANS ROWING 
BACK FROM THE GREEN AGENDA NOW THAT 
ECONOMIC THINGS ARE GETTING 
TIGHTER TIGHTER NO THAT RRP DIDN'T SAID THAT IT 
SAID THERE WAS A LOT TO BE DONE AND 
WE HAVE TO DO IT PROPERLY LET'S 
TAKE THE QUESTION OF STEALTH TAXES 
OF COURSE PEOPLE WON'T BELIEVE YOU 
ARE PUTTING TAXES ON IN ORDER TO 
CHANGE THEIR HABITS UNLESS THE 
MONEY FROM THE TAXES GOES TO 
SOMETHING THAT IS ENVIRONMENTALLY 
FRIENDLY IF IT'S MERELY SOMETHING 
THAT GOES INTO THE CHANCELLOR'S 
POCKET PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE IN IT 
SIMILARLY IF INSTEAD OF HAVING PAY 
AS YOU THROW WHY NOT HAVE PEOPLE 
CUT COUNCIL TAX IF THEY RECYCLE 
LET'S MAKE IT POSITIVE 
CAN I PICK YOU UP ON THE FIRST 
POINT YOU SAY IF YOU PAY GREEN 
TAXES IT HAS TO GO TOWARDS 
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE SEEN AS 
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AS OPPOSED 
TO INTO THE GENERAL POT SURELY 
THAT CONTRADICTS IT GREEN TAX IS 
SUPPOSED TO CHANGE BEHAVIOUR IF 
IT'S SUCCESSFUL AND THEY DO CHANGE 
BEHAVIOUR THERE IS NOT AS MUCH 
MONEY TO GO TOWARDS ENVIRONMENTAL 
MEASURES SO THE WHOLE CONSTRUCT 
FALLS DOWN 
IF YOU RAISE ONE MILLION FROM A 
GREEN TAX THAT CAN DO A LOT OF GOOD 
WHILE PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES ARE 
CHANGING SO DON'T THROW IT ASIDE 
USE IT SENSIBLY 
BUT IT'S NOT A 
LONG TERM POLICY TO BASE YOUR TAXES 
ON 
WITH GREAT RESPECT IT DOES TWO ON THINGS IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL IN 
CHANGING HABITS THAT IS WHAT YOU IT 
WANT TO DO WHILE YOU ARE DOING IT 
YOU ARE ABLE TO DO OTHER THINGS 
ABOVE ALL PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU ARE 
NOT USING THE ENVIRONMENT AS AN 
EXCUSE BUT YOU ARE COMMITTED TO 
REDUCING OUR EMISSIONS SO THAT WE 
DON'T ALLOW THIS PLANET TO BE A 
PLACE WHICH OUR CHILDREN CAN NOT 
INHERIT THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE 
WHICH OUGHT TO BE TALKING ABOUT L. 
THINK THAT WAS A RATHER SIMPLISTIC 
AND NOT VERY GOOD REPORT IF I MAY 
SAY SO 
HAVE YOU EVERY RIGHT TO SAY THAT 
THAT IS WHY I AM HERE 
WOULD YOU NOT AGREE THAT DAVID 
CAMERON IS ROWING BACK AS TIMES GET 
TOUGH LET ME GIVE YOU COUPLE OF 
EXAMPLES THE CONSERVATIVES ARE 
BACKING THE DELAY OF THE INCREASE 
IN FUEL TAX BORIS JOHNSON IS 
SCRAPPING THE TWENTY FIVE CONGESTION CHARGE 
FOR POLLUTING CARS THE TORIES ARE 
CRITICAL OF POLLUTING CARS THERE 
IS NO VAT ON FLIGHT AS YOU WANTED 
LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THOSE THE FACT IS THAT TAX ON FUEL 
DOESN'T CHANGE THE ATTITUDE OR 
ACTIONS OF MOTORIST HAVE YOU SEEN 
THAT BY THE INCREASE OF MOTORING 
EVEN THOUGH THE PRICE OF FUEL HAS 
GONE UP MADLY 
SO TAXES DON'T WORK 
PLEASE LET ME FINISH THE ANSWER IN 
THIS CASE WE KNOW THAT TAX ON FUEL 
DOESN'T HAVE THE EFFECT THAT IS WHY 
WE PROPOSED WHOLE SERIES OF 
ALTERNATIVES THAT WOULD WORK SO WE 
ARE NOT CHANGING OUR VIEW WE ARE 
NOT ROWING BACK ON ANYTHING IF YOU 
LOOK AT OUR VIEWS ON THE MORATORIUM 
WE ARE NOT IN POWER WE VICE 
PRESIDENT BEEN ABLE TO PUT A 
MORATORIUM 
BUT YOU COULD COMMIT TO MORATORIUM ONE 
WE HAVE COMMITTED OURSELVES ONE WE HAVE OPPOSED THE EXTENSIONS AT 
STANSTED AIRPORT WE HAVE OPPOSED 
THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION TO PUSH 
THROUGH THE PLANNING SYSTEM TO MAKE 
HEATHROW EXTENSION SOMETHING WHICH 
EVEN THE PUBLIC IS NOT GOING TO 
HAVE A WORD ABOUT WE HAVE DONE ALL 
OF THAT IF I MAY SAY SO YOU CAN 
THROW OUT A WHOLE SERIES WAS 
COMMENTS LIKE THAT NONE OF THEM 
ARE ACTUALLY ACCURATE WHAT YOU 
HAVE TO HAVE IS A POLICY WHICH IS 
CLEARLY STRAIGHT FORWARDLY 
HONESTLY CONCERNED TO REDUCE OUR 
EMISSIONS IN ORDER TO COMBAT 
CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WE HAVE GOT 
AND THAT WE ARE NOT CHANGING 
LET ME PUT THAT POINT DO YOU THINK 
THAT DAVID CAMERON IS ROWING BACK 
ON THE GREEN AGENDA NOW THAT THINGS 
ARE GETTING TOUGHER 
IT'S DIFFICULT 
TO KNOW CERTAINLY IF DAVID CAMERON 
DOES NOT STICK WITH HIS CREDENTIALS 
AS A GREEN POLITICIAN HE WILL 
DAMAGE HIS IMAGE AS AN AUTHENTIC 
PERSON WHO CARES ABOUT THE 
ENVIRONMENT I BELIEVE HE DOES L. 
DON'T THINK HE WILL WANT TO DO THAT 
UNDOUBTEDLY THE ECONOMIC SITUATION 
MEANS THEY HAVE TO GIVE MORE 
THOUGHT TO WHERE THE MONEY GOES 
THAT THEY RAISE ONE OPTION IS TO 
GIVE TO TO GREEN CAUSES ANOTHER IS 
TO GIVE IT BACK TO TAXPAYERS IN 
SOME OTHER FORM WITH ECONOMIC 
GROWTH BEING PROBLEMATIC THERE MAY 
BE MORE STRESS ON TRYING TO GIVE 
THE MONEY BACK AND LESS STRESS ON A 
HIGH TAX APPROACH 
A BRIEF WORD 
FROM YOU 
THERE IS A CERTAIN IRONY 
ABOUT PEOPLE ROWING BACK IN 
DIFFICULTIES OF COURSE YOU HAD THE 
STERN REPORT WHICH SAID IF WE DON'T 
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS G. D. P. WILL 
DROP BY TWENTY PER CENT WHO DOES ONE DO YOU 
LOOK AT THE POLLS PEOPLE ARE FEED 
FEELING THE PINCH PRICES GOING UP 
FUEL PRICES THIS IS A TIME WHEN 
IT'S CALLED FOR LEADERSHIP ON THE 
ISSUES ISSUES WE HAVE RUN OUT OF TIME 
IF THIS 
GOVERNMENT DID SOMETHING WE WOULD 
BE ALL RIGHT BUT IT DOES NOTHING 
YOU HAVE HAD THE LAST WORD GOOD GOOD TIME IT REVEAL YOUR TOP FIVE 
POLITICAL STORIES OF THE WEEK IT'S 
BEEN A AN ODD WEEK BECAUSE OF THE 
BANK HOLIDAY A LOT OF HANGOVER FROM 
LAST WEEK WHICH IS APT BECAUSE WE 
ARE CELEBRATING BORIS BECOMING 
MAYOR AND GORDON BROWN'S ONGOING 
ELECTION HANGOVER THIS IS THIS 
WEEK'S TOP OF THE POLITICAL POPS 
WE PROMISE YOU A MIRACLE WE 
PROMISE A GREAT V. T. HUNDREDS OF 
POWER STATIONS AND SEWAGE WORKS ARE 
UNDER THREAT OF FLOODING ACCORDING 
TO A SECRET REPORT IN THE WAKE OF 
LAST YEAR'S FLOODS STAFF AT SOME 
OF THE SITES HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY 
BOSS WARNING THEY I HAVE TO SHARE 
THEIR TEAROOM WITH HALF DOZEN TROUT 
THESE GIRLS CAN'T TAKE IT TROUT ANYMORE 
BOJO HAS MOJO AND BECOMES ANYMORE MAYOR THE ONCE CLOWN OF POLITICS 
STROLLED INTO THE TOP JOB HE HAS 
GOT HIS INSTANT REVENGE BY BANNING 
ALCOHOL ON TUBES AND BUS DON'T 
EXPECT ANY JOKES THE PRIME 
MINISTER REMINDS HIM NOT TO LEAVE 
THE GAFFE ON CANNABIS DOWNGRADED 
TO A CLASS C. DRUG SHOULD STAY THAT 
WAY UPON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT TOOK 
IMMEDIATE ACTION AND TOTALLY 
IGNORED IT AND UPGRADED IT TO CLASS 
B. B. JACQUI PRAISES THE POLICE FOR 
HARASSING KNOWN TROUBLE MAKERS IN 
ESSEX POLICE STICK TO THE THUGS 
LIKE GLUE MAKING OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR AS LIMITED 
THE GOVERNMENT THINKS IT'S A 
EXCELLENT IDEA SPECIALLY IF IT CAN 
BE USED ON UNRULEY M. P.'S ON ONE A 
BIG COMPLUNKING FIST REFUSES TO BE 
DOWN AND OUT CLUNKING DESPITE A 
PUMMELLING GORDON HAS BEEN 
RELAUNCHING TELLING EVERYONE HE 
WILL LISTEN AND LEAD HAVING TAKEN 
THE LEAD IN A SHAKESPEAREAN TRAGEDY 
THE NEW GORDON RISKS BEING A FLASH 
IN THE PAN 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT BORIS 
JOHNSON'S VICTORY IN THE MAYORAL 
ELECTIONS ONE THAT CAME AS A 
SURPRISE TO A LOT OF POLLSTERS 
MOST OF THEM HAD KEN LIVINGSTONE 
AHEAD DOES THIS MEAN THAT POLLS 
ARE IRRELEVANT 
I THINK INTERNETING POLLING WHICH 
IS WHAT YOUGOV DO HELPS THEM TO 
FIND PEOPLE IN BIG CITIES THERE 
WAS A REASON THEY DID BETTER SOME 
OF OTHER POLLS AREN'T WEIGHTED 
PROPERLY I WASN'T THAT SURPRISED 
I THOUGHT HE WOULD WIN AND I WASN'T 
SURPRISED THAT YOUGOV GOT IT MORE 
ACCURATE 
IS INTERNET POLLING THE ACCURATE WAY FORWARD 
IF YOU LOOK AT YOUGOV 
THEY ARE WINNING THEY ARE NOT SPOT 
ON IN TERMS OF THEIR PREDICTIONS 
BUT CLOSER THAN ANYONE ELSE LOOK 
AT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE STATES IOWA 
NO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE 
WE MUST LEAVE IT THERE THAT IS ALL 
FOR THIS WEEK I WILL LEAVE YOU 
WITH IMAGES OF BORIS JOHNSON 
GETTING DOWN TO WORK IN HIS NEW 
MAYORAL OFFICE 
USER NAME WHATS' MY USER NAME 
JOHNSON B. JOHNSON YOUR PASSWORD IS 
COMING SHORTLY 
WE DON'T KNOW MY 
PASSWORD 
WE HAVE MADE IT TO THE END OF OF 
THE WEEK HERE IS A CHANCE TO
