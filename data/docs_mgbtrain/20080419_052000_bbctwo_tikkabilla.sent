THAT WAS GREAT FUN WASN'T IT THAT WAS GREAT FUN 
AND IT MUST BE GREAT FUN BEING AN ANIMAL IN THE JUNGLE 
SWINGING THROUGH TREES AND RUNNING THROUGH BUSHES 
ANIMALS DON'T JUST LIVE IN JUNGLES 
WHERE ELSE DO THEY LIVE THEY LIVE EVERYWHERE 
IF YOU LOOK VERY CLOSELY YOU CAN SEE ANIMALS IN THE TOWNS AND CITIES 
WHAT ANIMALS LIVE IN THE TOWNS AND CITIES LORNA 
WELL MAYBE WE'LL FIND OUT 
THROUGH THE WINDOWS 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO 
THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE 
ARCHED WINDOW 
DO YOU LIVE IN A CITY 
CITIES ARE FULL OF LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE 
BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT LOTS OF ANIMALS LIVE IN CITIES TOO 
IEEE 
THESE ARE PIGEONS 
PIGEONS ARE VERY COMMON BIRDS 
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU SEE LOTS OF THEM QUITE OFTEN 
ESPECIALLY IN CITIES 
SOMETIMES BIGGER BIRDS CALLED FALCONS TRY TO CATCH PIGEONS 
FOR THEIR SUPPER 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE PIGEON HAS ESCAPED FROM THE FALCON THIS TIME 
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN CITIES 
THEY MAKE LOTS AND LOTS OF RUBBISH 
SOME ANIMALS FIND OUR RUBBISH VERY TASTY 
THIS IS A RAT 
AND IT HAS SNIFFED OUT 
SOME TASTY LEFTOVERS IN A BIN 
BUT IT HAD BETTER WATCH OUT 
HERE'S ANOTHER ANIMAL LOOKING FOR FOOD 
IT'S A FOX 
FOXES QUITE LIKE LIFE IN THE BIG CITY AS WELL 
AND THEY COME TO LOOK AROUND FOR FOOD AT NIGHT 
HERE'S ANOTHER ANIMAL WHICH SOMETIMES COMES RIGHT INTO THE CITY 
ESPECIALLY INTO PEOPLE'S BACK GARDENS 
YES THAT'S WHAT IT IS 
THIS PERSON HAS LEFT SOME FOOD OUT FOR THESE BADGERS 
SO THEY COME HERE QUITE OFTEN FOR A TASTY TREAT 
SOME ANIMALS DON'T JUST COME LOOKING FOR FOOD IN THE CITY 
THEY LIVE THERE 
THESE ANIMALS ARE CALLED RACOONS 
AND THEY LIVE IN SOME CITIES IN AMERICA 
A NICE COSY ATTIC MAKES THE IDEAL HOME FOR THEM 
AND IF THEY CAN'T GET INTO THE ROOF THEY WILL QUITE HAPPILY SETTLE 
FOR THE CHIMNEY 
IN SOME CITIES 
THERE ARE BIG PARKS 
SO THAT YOU CAN GO FOR A WALK 
WHERE THERE ARE TREES AND WATER 
AND WILDLIFE 
PARKS ARE THE BEST PLACES OF ALL 
TO SEE ANIMALS IN THE CITY 
ISN'T IT AMAZING HOW MANY DIFFERENT ANIMALS 
CAN LIVE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY 
NEXT TIME YOU GO TO A BIG CITY 
SEE HOW MANY DIFFERENT ANIMALS 
YOU CAN SPOT 
I DIDN'T REALISE SO MANY ANIMALS LIVED IN THE CITY 
OH YEAH AND NOT JUST IN THE CITIES TAMBA 
BUT IN THE SKIES ABOVE THE CITIES TOO 
OH IT MUST BE GREAT TO HAVE WINGS AND FLY UP UP INTO THE CLOUDS 
AND LOOK DOWN ON WHAT'S GOING ON BELOW 
YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE WINGS THOUGH SIMON 
YOU COULD GO UP IN AN AEROPLANE OR A ROCKET 
I SUPPOSE I COULD 
BUT AEROPLANES AND ROCKETS ARE REALLY NOISY 
AND I'D LIKE IT TO BE NICE AND QUIET 
AND PEACEFUL 
I WONDER WHAT I COULD TRAVEL IN 
AH IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT THE CLOCK 
TIKKABILLA TOCKABILLA 
TIKKABILLA TOCK 
WHAT'S THE TIME ON THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
WELL THE LONG HAND IS POINTING 
TOWARDS THE NUMBER 
SIX 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS 
THAT MEANS IT'S HALF PAST SOMETHING 
AND THE SMALL HAND IS POINTING JUST PAST THE NUMBER 
EIGHT 
SO THE CLOCK SAYS IT'S HALF PAST EIGHT 
BUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CLOCK 
A PIECE OF MATERIAL 
WITH A LUMP IN IT 
I WONDER WHAT IT IS 
TODAY'S STORY'S CALLED 
THE GRUMPALUMP 
THE BEAR STARED AT THE GRUMPALUMP 
THE LUMP GRUMPED 
THE BEAR STARED 
AND THE CAT SAT 
ON THE GRUMPALUMP 
THE LUMP GRUMPED 
THE BEAR STARED 
THE CAT SAT 
AND THE MOLE ROLLED 
ON THE GRUMPALUMP 
THE LUMP GRUMPED 
THE BEAR STARED 
THE CAT SAT 
THE MOLE ROLLED 
AND THE DOVE SHOVED 
THE GRUMPALUMP 
THE LUMP STILL GRUMPED 
THE BEAR STARED 
THE CAT SAT 
THE MOLE ROLLED 
THE DOVE SHOVED 
AND THE BULL PULLED 
THE GRUMPALUMP 
THE LUMP STILL GRUMPED 
THE BEAR STARED 
THE CAT SAT 
THE MOLE ROLLED 
THE DOVE SHOVED 
THE BULL PULLED 
AND THE YAK WHACKED 
THE GRUMPALUMP 
THE LUMP STILL GRUMPED 
THE BEAR STARED 
THE CAT SAT 
THE MOLE ROLLED 
THE DOVE SHOVED 
THE BULL PULLED 
THE YAK WHACKED 
AND THE ARMADILLO 
USED IT FOR A PILLOW 
BUT THE LUMP STILL GRUMPED 
THEN THE GNU 
BLEW 
THE LUMP GREW PLUMP 
AND GOT HUMPS AND BUMPS 
AND BITS AND BOBS 
AND INTERESTING KNOBS 
AND WINGS AND THINGS 
ATTACHED WITH STRINGS 
AND STILL THE GNU 
BLEW 
THEN TO EVERYONE'S SURPRISE 
THE GRUMPALUMP BEGAN 
TO RISE 
THE GNU DREW BREATH 
AND CLAMBERED IN 
THE GRUMPALUMP BEGAN TO GRIN 
I'M OFF ON A TRIP IN MY HOT AIR SHIP 
SAID THE GNU AND FLEW 
ABSOLUTELY TRUE 
AND HOW THE BEAR STARED 
THE LUMP WAS A HOT AIR BALLOON 
ALL ALONG M. M. M. 
IT MUST BE VERY EXCITING GOING UP INTO THE SKY IN A HOT AIR BALLOON 
IF A HOT AIR BALLOON DOESN'T HAVE AN ENGINE OR WINGS 
HOW DOES IT FLY WELL 
WE MIGHT FIND OUT 
THROUGH ONE OF THE WINDOWS SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO 
THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S 
THE 
ROUND WINDOW 
THAT'S TED AND HE'S GONNA TAKE US UP IN HIS HOT AIR BALLOON 
BUT FIRST PAUL NEEDS TO LOAD THE GAS CANISTER INTO THE BASKET 
THE GAS FROM THE CANISTER IS PUMPED UP 
TO A BURNER 
TED TESTS THE BURNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE WORKING 
TED AND PAUL LAY THE BASKET ON THE FLOOR 
SO THAT THEY CAN CONNECT THE BALLOON TO IT 
THE BALLOON IS VERY LONG AND FLAT AT THE MOMENT 
THESE FANS ARE USED TO OPEN THE HOT AIR BALLOON ENOUGH 
TO ALLOW THE BURNERS TO BLOW UP THE BALLOON 
WOW LOOK HOW BIG IT IS 
IT LOOKS LIKE A GREAT BIG BALLOON HALL 
ONCE THE BALLOON HAS BEEN OPENED OUT 
TED CAN BLOW HOT AIR INTO IT WHICH WILL MAKE IT RISE 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME FOR A FLIGHT WITH US JUST JUMP IN THE BASKET 
HERE WE GO 
UP 
UP AND AWAY 
WE'RE REALLY HIGH NOW 
EVERY TIME I HEAT THE BALLOON UP 
THE AIR INSIDE THE BALLOON BECOMES MUCH LIGHTER 
AND SO WE RISE LIKE A BUBBLE OF AIR IN WATER 
AND WHEN I LET IT COOL WE DESCEND SO THAT'S HOW A BALLOON WORKS 
ARE YOU ENJOYING THE FLIGHT HOPE SO I AM 
SEE THESE PIECES OF STRING I'M PULLING AT THE MOMENT 
THESE TURN THE BALLOON ROUND THEY'RE CALLED ROTATION VENTS 
WE'RE SO HIGH THAT THOSE ANIMALS LOOK LIKE ANTS 
LOOK A SHEEP AND THREE LAMBS 
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO BE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET UP IN THE AIR 
WE'VE GOT TO FIND SOMEWHERE TO LAND 
NEAR HASLEMERE I THINK 
THAT'S OUR RETRIEVE TRUCK COMING ALONG TO PICK US UP 
HOLD ON WE'RE IN FOR A BUMPY LANDING 
O. K. ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME PUT THE BALLOON AWAY 
IT'S ALL GOT TO BE FOLDED UP 
AND PUT BACK IN THE BAG 
THAT BASKET MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY STRONG TO CARRY ALL THOSE PEOPLE 
I TELL YOU WHAT 
WHY DON'T WE MAKE A BASKET FOR TAMBA 
BUT NOT A HOT AIR BALLOON BASKET 
A SHOPPING BASKET 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED 
A FRUIT PUNNET 
YOU CAN GET THESE IN THE SUPERMARKET WITH FRESH FRUIT INSIDE THEM 
WE'LL NEED SOME LOLLY STICKS 
AND SOME RIBBON 
NOW THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO 
IS TO STICK 
SOME OF OUR LOLLY STICKS 
TO OUR PUNNET 
AND THE WAY I'M GOING TO DO THAT 
IS TO LAY THREE OF THEM OUT 
AND STICK THEM TOGETHER 
WITH SOME STICKY TAPE 
AND IF I STICK THEM 
TO THE SIDE 
OF OUR PUNNET LIKE THAT 
THAT'S THE BEGINNING 
OF OUR BASKET NOW I NEED TO DO THAT TO THE REST OF THE SIDE

THE LOLLY STICKS 
YOU CAN SEE ALREADY 
IT'S BEGINNING 
TO LOOK 
LIKE A LITTLE SHOPPING BASKET 
NOW WE NEED TO GO FOR 
SOME RED RIBBON 
LET'S PUT A LITTLE BIT OF STICKY TAPE ON THAT 
AND THIS TIME 
WE NEED TO GO TO THE FRONT 
OF OUR LOLLY STICK 
AND GO IN
