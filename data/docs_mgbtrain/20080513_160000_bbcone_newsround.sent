HI THERE YOU'RE WITH NEWSROUND WE 
HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW 
DEVASTATION IN CHINA A MASSIVE 
SEARCH AND RES SEARCH IS UNDER WAY 
PLUS THE MAN WHO SURVIVED A SHARK 
ATTACK BY GIVING IT A POKE IN THE 
EYE EYE STICK AROUND FOR THAT FIRST TO 
CHINA WHERE RESCUE WORKERS ARE 
SEARCHING FOR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
TRAPPED UNDER RUBBLE AFTER 
YESTERDAY'S EARTHQUAKE HEAVY RAINS 
MAKING THE RESCUE OPERATION MORE 
DIFFICULT AND SO FAR MORE THAN 
TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED 
CHINA'S IN SHOCK AFTER BEING HIT BY 
THE MOST POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE IN THE 
COUNTRY FOR THIRTY YEARS THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IT'S NOW A 
RACE AGAINST TIME TO GET TO THOSE 
WHO ARE STILL TRAPPED THE CENTRE 
OF THE EARTHQUAKE WAS IN AN AREA 
CALLED SICHUAN PROVINCE IT IS 
THOUGHT ALMOST ALL THE BUILDINGS 
THERE COLLAPSED DURING THE QUAKE 
BUT BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE ROADS 
FROM DESTROYED TOO IT'S BEEN 
DIFFICULT FOR RESCUERS TO GET THERE 
MORE THAN A THOUSAND TROOPS AND 
MEDICAL STAFF HAVE REACHED THE 
WORST HIT AREA BUT HEAVY RAIN 
MEANS SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS IS 
TOUGH ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THINGS IS RESCUING SCHOOLCHILDREN 
BECAUSE THE QUAKE HIT AT TWO THIRTY P. M. IN 
THE AFTERNOON LOADS OF THEM ARE 
TRAPPED UNDER COLLAPSED SCHOOL 
BUILDINGS THIS GIRL MANAGED TO 
SURVIVE THROUGH THE NIGHT AND WAS 
PULLED OUT THIS MORNING 
THERE ARE CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN 
INJURED SOME WHO LOST LIVES AND 
LOST LOVED ONES WE NEED TO GET 
THEIR LIVES BACK TO NORMAL AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLE WE HAVE PEOPLE ON THE 
GROUND WHO CAN HELP CHILDREN GET 
BACK INTO SCHOOL BY PROVIDING 
TEMPORARY CLASSES EQUIPMENT AND 
ALSO LOOK AFTER CHILDREN AND 
PROVIDE CARE AND PROTECTION FOR 
CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN SEPARATED 
FROM THEIR FAMILIES 
THE CHINA 
GOVERNMENT SENT FIFTY THOUSAND TROOPS TO 
HELP WITH THE MASSIVE SEARCH AND 
RESCUE OPERATION BUT WITH AS MANY 
AS TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE TRAPPED UNDER 
RUBBLE IN ONE CITY ALONE T. KNOWS 
EVERY SECOND IS VITAL TO SAVE LIVES 
SO WHAT'S GOING ON ACROSS THE GLOBE 
THIS IS THE SECOND BIG NATURAL 
DISASTER TO HIT THE SAME PART OF 
SOUTH EAST ASIA IN TWO WEEKS ARE 
THEY CONNECTED IT'S EASY TO GET 
UPSET AND CONFUSED OVER THE LAST 
FEW DAYS WE'VE BEEN SEEING AWFUL 
PICTURES OF PEOPLE SUFFERING IN 
BURMA BECAUSE OF THE CYCLONE AND 
NOW IN CHINA BECAUSE OF THE 
EARTHQUAKE IT MIGHT SEEX A BIT ODD 
FOR TWO SUCH TERRIBLE THINGS TO 
HAPPEN SO CLOSE TOGETHER IN JUST 
TWO WEEKS APART EXPERTS SAY THIS 
WAS JUST A COINCIDENCE THAT THE 
CYCLONE DIDN'T AFFECT THE 
EARTHQUAKE AND THEY'RE BOTH CAUSED 
BY DIFFERENT THINGS THE CYCLONE 
THAT HIT BURMA STARTED AS A MASSIVE 
STORM OUT AT SEA IT'S THOUGHT ALL 
THE WIND CAUSE ADD HUGE WAVE WHICH 
THEN HIT LAND DESTROYING 
EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH 
THE HIGH WINDS AND HEAVY RAIN ALSO 
CAUSED DEVASTATION INLAND AS WELL 
WHEREAS THE EARTHQUAKE WHICH HIT 
CHINA WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IT 
STARTED UNDERGROUND AS THE TWO HUGE 
PLATES IN THE EARTH UNDERNEATH THE 
COUNTRY STARTED MOVING AROUND THAT 
CAUSED THE GROUND TO SHAKE MEANING 
LOTS OF BUILDINGS COLLAPSED AND 
PEOPLE WERE TRAPPED IN THE U. K. WE 
SOMETIMES HAVE SMALL EARTHQUAKES 
AND STORMS BUT NOTHING COMPARED TO 
THIS ALL WE CAN DO IS TO SEND HELP 
AND HOPE THAT IT WILL BE A LONG 
TIME BEFORE IT HAPPENS AGAIN
