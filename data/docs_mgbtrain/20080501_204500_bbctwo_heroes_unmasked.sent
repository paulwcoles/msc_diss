THE FIRST SERIES WAS ALL ABOUT THE BEGINNING THE INCEPTION 
ALL OF US DISCOVERING OUR ABILITIES AND OUR POWERS 
NOW WHERE DO THEY COME FROM SO IT'S KIND OF RESETTING BACK TO ZERO 
JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE GONE SO FAR YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK 
MOTHERS FATHERS SONS AND DAUGHTERS 
BLOOD TIES RUN DEEP 
WITH THE WEIGHT OF HISTORY UPON THEM OUR HEROES BEGIN TO DEAL 
WITH THE DEEDS OF THEIR ANCESTORS 
GENERATIONS DEFINITELY FOCUSES ON THE HOW 
YOU KNOW HOW DID A LOT OF THIS COME ABOUT AND WHEN 
HIRO'S FATHER KAITO AND CHARLES DEVEAUX AND LINDERMAN 
AND ANGELA PETRELLI ALL OF THESE PEOPLE 
CLEARLY HAD A HISTORY WITH ONE ANOTHER 
AND CLEARLY HAD IN SOME CASES SOME KIND OF POWER OR ABILITY 
SO WHO WERE THOSE PEOPLE AND WHAT WAS THAT STORY ABOUT 
THE POSSIBILITIES OF WHAT IS BEHIND THIS WHOLE STORY 
WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE PRESENT HEROES 
AND WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE 
WHAT DID THEY DO 
WHY DID THEY DO IT 
WHAT WAS THEIR MOTIVATION 
AND WHAT HAVE THEY LEFT IN THEIR WAKE 
IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING STORY TO TELL 
HOW CAN YOU BE SO COLD BECAUSE I KNOW YOU NATHAN 
BENEATH THE GRUFF EXTERIOR YOU'RE A SAP 
EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY WAS THAT WE ARE AT THE END OF THE DAY 
PRODUCTS OF OUR MOTHERS AND FATHERS 
AND SINCE SO MANY OF OUR CHARACTERS ARE REALLY AFFECTED 
BY FATHER ISSUES AND MOTHER ISSUES 
THAT BEING ABLE TO SEE WHERE THEY CAME FROM 
AND BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHO THEY WERE 
ENABLED US TO ENTITLE THIS VOLUME AS GENERATIONS 
I THINK ONE OF THE THEMES TO THE SECOND SEASON 
IS ALL THESE RELATIONSHIPS WHAT HAPPENS IF WE SPLIT THEM APART 
AND THE MOST DIVIDED FAMILY ON THE HEROES BLOCK 
YOU GUESSED IT IT'S THE PETRELLIS 
A VERY SPECIAL FAMILY YOU HAVE NO IDEA 
IT'S SO FUNNY TO TALK ABOUT THE PETRELLIS 
BECAUSE YOU GO BACK TO THE PILOT 
DAD'S GONE JUST GET OVER IT NO LEAVE HERE ALONE 
WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT THE PILOT 
HERE'S NATHAN AND HE SO STRONG AND HE'S DRIVING THE STORY 
IF YOU CAN FLY WHY DON'T YOU JUMP OFF THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU 
PETER PLAYED BY MILO HE'S A DREAMER 
AND HE CAN'T GET ANYTHING ACCOMPLISHED AND HE'S THE EMBARRASSMENT TO THE FAMILY 
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO ME 
AND I FEEL YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'LL UNDERSTAND 
WHY WOULD I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU THINK YOU CAN FLY 
THEN THERE'S ANGELA MOM I CAN'T TALK WHO DESPERATELY IS LOOKING FOR ATTENTION 
SHE GOT ARRESTED ARRESTED FOR WHAT SHOPLIFTING 
AND WHO HAS GONE OUT OF CONTROL 
NO BIG DEAL I'M RUNNING FOR CONGRESS DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THIS'LL DO TO ME 
IT'S UNEXPECTED THAT SHE'S GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE AS HARD BOILED AS SHE'S GOING TO BE 
YOU KNOW ABOUT LINDERMAN'S PLANS YES WELL THEY'RE NOT JUST HIS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE PUT TIME AND CARE INTO MAKING THIS A REALITY MYSELF INCLUDED 
THIS IS A LOT OF HORRIBLE STUFF THAT'S IN MOTION 
THAT SHE WAS A PART OF SETTING FORWARD 
SHE PULLED THE TRIGGER ON A LOT OF THIS STUFF 
WHEN I FIRST WROTE THE FIRST SCENE THAT SHE HAS 
I STARTED TO THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE A GREATER ROLE FOR THIS CHARACTER 
SHE WAS CALLED ANGELA BY THE WAY 
AFTER ANGELA LANSBURY IN THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE 
BECAUSE I STARTED THINKING ABOUT HER IN THOSE TERMS 
SHE'S SORT OF BEHIND THE SCENES AND THERE ARE SECRETS 
AND THERE ARE AGENDAS THAT YOU'RE NEVER QUITE SURE OF 
SO IT WAS BUILT INTO THE D. N. A. OF THE CHARACTER TO BECOME THAT 
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY THE FUN OF CRISTINE 
THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO GIVE US THESE DELICIOUS MOMENTS 
AND THE WRITERS ALL STARTED WANTING TO WRITE FOR HER 
YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ME NATHAN 
BUT I DO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU 
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF 
THINK I'M A MASS MURDERER 
IMPORTANT MEN MAKE IMPOSSIBLE DECISIONS 
THE EVENTS OF LAST SEASON REALLY TORE THE FAMILY APART 
AND LEFT THEM ALL IN A VERY DAMAGED PLACE 
THE STATE OF THE PETRELLI FAMILY AS WE OPEN SEASON TWO VOLUME TWO I SHOULD SAY 
IS DEVASTATION ANGELA HAS LOST HER FAVOURITE CHILD 
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON NATHAN HE'S DEAD 
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT 
LEAVE HIS STUFF ALONE HE'S GONNA WANT IT WHEN HE GETS BACK 
YOU'RE DRUNK 
SHE'S NOT HAPPY 
THANK GOD YOUR FATHER ISN'T HERE TO SEE YOU OR YOU FOR THAT MATTER 
THE DYNAMIC THAT I THINK EXISTS WITHIN THE PETRELLI HOUSE IS A MESS 
I HATE NATHAN AT THIS POINT 
I HATE HIM 
YOU KILLED YOUR BROTHER DROVE HEIDI AWAY DROVE YOUR KIDS AWAY 
IF YOU'D FOLLOWED OUR PLAN IF YOU'D DONE WHAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO HE'D BE ALIVE NOW 
I THINK THERE'S A DEFINITE SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT ON BOTH SIDES 
AT WHO THEY'VE TURNED OUT TO BE 
YOU'RE EVIL MA 
HE'S GONE OFF AND BECOME A DRUNKEN BUM 
SHOWING SUCH WEAKNESS AND SHE'S DEVASTATED SHE'S LOST EVERYTHING 
GET OUT 
GO 
IT'S A VERY DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY VERY SPREAD OUT 
IT'S JUST NOT HEALTHY 
THE FIRST SEASON THAT'S A LITTLE OUTSIDE OF MY GAME 
WHAT I WAS PLAYING 
I MEAN I'M NOT THAT BIG OF AN ASS YOU KNOW 
I'M SURE I HAVE MY MOMENTS BUT I THINK THERE'S STILL ALWAYS 
A REDEEMABLE PART THERE'S A PART THAT CAN BE SALVAGED 
AND SHE DOESN'T REPRESENT THAT AS MUCH AS I THINK HE DOES 
BUT IS IT TOO LATE FOR ANGELA AND KAITO TO SEEK REDEMPTION 
SHE KNOWS IT'S A MARK FOR DEATH 
LET ME SEE IT 
YOU KNOW THAT EACH OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT PHOTOGRAPH ARE DOOMED 
I DO NOT TAKE DEATH THREATS IDLY SOMEONE'S PLAYING A TRICK ARE THEY 
SHE KNOWS PROBABLY WHO WANTS TO KILL THEM 
SO YOU THINK ONE OF US SENT THESE YES FOR THE PAIN WE CAUSED 
THE PEOPLE WE HAVE KILLED 
THERE IS NO END TO OUR SUFFERING 
IT'S AN ILLUMINATION OF WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 
ACTION 
YOU SEE RELATIONSHIPS STARTING TO MINGLE YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT SHE KNEW HIM UNTIL THAT MOMENT 
WELL IF SHE KNOWS HIM 
IF THEY'RE CLOSE ENOUGH TO TALK THAT WAY TO ONE ANOTHER WITH SUCH GREAT FAMILIARITY 
HOW LONG HAVE THEY KNOWN EACH OTHER 
WHAT HAVE THEY MEANT TO EACH OTHER 
I KNOW THAT THERE'S SOMETHING 
VERY PROFOUNDLY SENSUAL WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP 
SOMETHING HAPPENED WITH KAITO AT SOME POINT IN OUR LIFE 
THERE WERE TWELVE OF US 
NOW THERE ARE NINE 
THERE'S MUCH MUCH MORE THAN IS BEING TOLD EVEN AT THAT MOMENT 
I SOUGHT REDEMPTION 
BY HELPING HIRO FULFIL HIS DESTINY TO SAVE THE WORLD 
HOW DID YOU HELP YOUR SON 
IT'S ABSOLUTE FEAR AND IN THAT MOMENT OF FEAR 
COMRADES TURN ON EACH OTHER 
AND THAT SLAP WAS GREAT I LOVED IT 
SHE'S A GOOD SLAPPER 
SHE SLAPPED 
HIT ME HIT ME HIT ME 
CUT 
WHEN WE REACH A POINT WHERE A STORYLINE 
SIMPLY DOESN'T SUPPORT A PARTICULAR ACTOR ANYMORE 
IT'S REALLY HEARTBREAKING TIM HAS TO MAKE THAT CALL 
ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SEASON 
I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM TIM KRING 
SO THEY DREAD THAT CALL TIM KRING IS CALLING 
IT'S LIKE HELLO OH GOD 
AND HE SAID GEORGE I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK 
THAT THIS IS THE GRIM REAPER CALL 
GRIM REAPER CALL WHY DID HE HAVE TO PREFACE IT THAT WAY 
OF ALL OF THEM I NEVER EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD BE YOU 
I WAITED FOR THE SCRIPT TO COME IT CAME I STARTED READING 
AND I THOUGHT OH MY 
I FALL OF THIS HIGH RISE BUILDING 
AND WE SEE THIS BODY IN A POOL OF BLOOD ON THE PAVEMENT BELOW 
THAT MEANS WELL IT WAS THE GRIM REAPER CALL 
I THOUGHT THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SEASON HOW DISAPPOINTING 
KAITO NAKAMURA MAY BE DEAD BUT GEORGE TAKEI WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH 
ONE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS ABOUT THE SHOW 
IS YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW ENOUGH 
TO SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT PERSON IS DEAD 
ONE CHARACTER WHO'S DEFINITELY ALIVE AND KICKING 
IS PETER IN IRELAND 
BUT THESE SCENES WERE ACTUALLY SHOT MUCH CLOSER TO HOME 
SO THIS IS ONE OF OUR PARKING LOTS HERE AT THE STUDIO 
THAT IS DOUBLED AS A NUMBER OF EXTERIOR LOCATIONS FOR US 
MY FELLOW AMERICANS FELLOW NEW YORKERS 
PLEASE LET US TAKE A MOMENT 
TO REMEMBER THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
WHO WERE TAKEN FROM US 
SEASON ONE FOR GROUND ZERO THAT WAS DONE OUT HERE 
BY ADDING SOME BIG SET PIECES AND SOME HUGE GREEN SCREENS 
THIS IS WHERE NATHAN PETRELLI GIVES HIS SPEECH 
MOST RECENTLY IT WAS THE SITE OF THE PORT OF CORK 
HEY BOSS OVER THERE 
THAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED HERE BY US BRINGING IN 
TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY SHIPPING CONTAINERS AND LAYING THEM OUT IN A GRID 
SO AGAIN ANYTHING ON A LARGE SCALE 
WE TRY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND TRY DO AS MUCH HERE 
LESS MONEY THAT WE SPEND GOING OFF LOT 
IS MORE MONEY THAT WE CAN PUT INTO WHAT SHOWS UP ON SCREEN 
DIRTY OLD TOWN BY THE POGUES 
AND WE CREATED THIS SMALL EXTERIOR FACADE 
THAT IS THE TOWN OF CORK WHICH IS ONE OF THE CITIES 
THAT OUR SEASON TWO EPISODES TAKE PLACE IN 
AND BASICALLY WE'VE JUST ATTACHED THESE FACADES 
TO THE SIDE OF ONE OF THE SUPPORT BUILDINGS 
AND WE'LL COME OUT AND DO FILMING HERE 
IT'S ALSO THE WANDERING ROCKS PUB 
WHICH IS JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR 
AND IT GIVES YOU AN INTERIOR SLASH EXTERIOR 
THE ACTORS CAN ACTUALLY WALK INSIDE OUT ONTO THE STREET OR VICE VERSA 
AND WE HAVE IT RIGGED FOR RAIN 
THAT'S WHAT ALL THE LINES ARE UP ABOVE 
AND IT ALLOWS US SOME FLEXIBILITY TO OPEN IT UP 
AND NOT FEEL SO CLAUSTROPHOBIC BY ONLY BEING INSIDE 
DIRTY OLD TOWN 
BUT THERE IS SOMEONE WHO'S FEELING VERY CLAUSTROPHOBIC 
WHAT'S THAT 
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE 
IT WAS FUNNY HE CAME IN TO MEET WITH TIM KRING 
OVER THE HIATUS BETWEEN SERIES ONE AND SERIES TWO 
AND HE SAID SO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MY CHARACTER 
AND TIM SAID WELL YOU HAVE AMNESIA 
AND HE SAID O. K. MY QUESTIONS ARE DONE I DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING 
WHO ARE YOU WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
I DON'T KNOW 
STARTED GETTING READY FOR SEASON TWO 
BY HEARING HEY YOU'RE STARTING THE SHOW WITH YOUR SHIRT OFF 
SO I'M LIKE O. K. I'M GONNA GO TO THE GYM GUYS 
I'M GONNA WORK OUT A LITTLE BIT 
HARDER BETTER FASTER STRONGER BY DAFT PUNK 
MILO SPENT THE SUMMER WORKING OUT 
AND WHEN HE CAME AND WE SAW WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE 
THE UNPLEASANT JOB CAME TO ME TO SAY 
MILO YOUR SHIRT'S COMING OFF THIS YEAR HE WAS UP FOR IT 
BET YOU LOOKED PRETTIER YESTERDAY 
OUTRAGEOUS IT WAS A NIGHTMARE HAVING TO WORK WITH THAT EVERY DAY 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME I DON'T KNOW 
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER SOMETHING ANYTHING A NAME A FACE 
WE LIKE TO SEE A LOT OF HIS BODY 
SO HIS BODY WAS EXPOSED A LOT AND UM THAT'S A GOOD THING 
THE SPARK I THINK IT CAME FROM ME 
MY HAND 
BRITISH ACTRESS KATIE CARR HAD THE LUCK OF THE IRISH 
WHEN SHE JOINED THE HEROES CAST 
YOU KNOW GETTING THE CALL SAYING YOU'VE GOT THE JOB AND VERY EXCITED 
AND I THOUGHT I NEED TO CATCH UP ON THE SHOW 
SO I WATCHED IT BACK TO BACK 
I WAS COMPLETELY HOOKED BY THE END OF IT 
AND THEN IT WAS COMING UP TO THE FIRST DAY 
AND IT IS A LITTLE BIT DAUNTING BECAUSE YOU THINK 
O. K. THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FOR A YEAR NOW 
THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND I JUST THOUGHT 
I'M JUST GONNA GO IN BE PROFESSIONAL AND DO THE JOB 
THEY JUST SEEM LIKE A BIG FAMILY THEY WERE VERY WELCOMING 
EVERYONE ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE 
JUST A REALLY NICE BUNCH 
BUT PETER'S NEW BUDDIES ARE NOT SO FRIENDLY 
MY NAME'S PETER 
IT IS A TURNING POINT WHEN PETER REALISES 
THAT HIS CAPTORS ACTUALLY HOLD THE KEY TO HIS FREEDOM 
YOU KNOW HIS UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE HE COMES FROM 
AND WHERE ULTIMATELY HE IS GOING TO GO 
THIS IS EVERYTHING YOU HAD WHEN WE FOUND YOU 
CREDIT CARDS MAYBE A TRAIN TICKET 
COULD EVEN BE A LOVE LETTER 
IT'S ALL YOURS YOU JUST HAVE TO HELP US 
WITH ONE LITTLE JOB 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS THAT PETER HAS TO RECOGNISE AND NOT LET PASS 
NEXT TIME ON HEROES 
HAS WILL'S LITTLE JOB OFFER TURNED PETER TO THE DARK SIDE
