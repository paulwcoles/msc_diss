A BACTERIUM THAT HAS BEEN AROUND 
SINCE THE DINOSAURS DOZING FOR 
MILLENIA NOW IT'S WAKING UP 
IT PLAYS A PART IN THE DEATHS OF AT 
LEAST FOUR TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE IN 
OUR HOSPITALS AS MRSA 
THE DEATHS 
OF SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE A YEAR IS THE 
EQUIVALENT OF ONE PERSON DYING 
EVERY HOUR IN OUR HOSPITALS 
INFECTION RATES APPEAR TO HAVE GONE 
DOWN IN SOME PARTS OF THE U. K. BUT 
WE ARE STILL BOTTOM OF THE WORLD 
LEAGUE 
IF YOU LOOK IT IS OVER SIXTY FIVES LEAGUE THE GROUP WHERE THERE ARE MORE 
DEATHS THEN WE HAVE MORE DEATHS IN 
THAT AGE GROUP THAN ANY OTHER 
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD BY A FACTOR OF 
TEN 
TONIGHT PANORAMA GOES INSIDE A TEN HOSPITAL TRUST THAT WAS IN CRISIS 
IT LOST NINETY PATIENTS TO THE SUPERBUG 
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE WITH OVER 
ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE INFECTED 
WE ACTUALLY 
JOKE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE A DEAL 
WITH THE UNDERTAKER BECAUSE WE SAW 
SO MANY GODIES GOING OUT UNDER UNDER STAFFED NURSES WERE IN DESPAIR 
I FEEL 
BIT SICK REALLY FEEL BIT SICK TO THINK THAT ACTUALLY 
THOSE THAT WAS ACTUALLY GOING ON 
AND I WAS PART OF IT 
NOW THIS TRUST IS FIGHTING BACK 
BUT ARE OTHER HOSPITALS DOING 
ENOUGH TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND WHY 
IS THERE NOT MORE FUNDING FOR 
RESEARCH INTO HOW THIS DEADLY 
SUPERBUG SPREADS 
HOSPITALS ARE 
FULL OF SICK PATIENTS AND FIT 
BACTERIA THE BACTERIA ARE GETTING 
FITTER AND FITTER 
IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT DAY AT THE 
KENT AND SUSSEX SEVEN PATIENTS 
HAVE CONTRACTED THE C. DIFFICILE 
BACTERIA BACTERIA THE SITUATION UNCOVERED BY THE 
HEALTHCARE COMMISSION AT THE THROW 
HOSPITALS IS TRULY SCANDALOUS 
DIRTY BATHROOMS NURSES TOO BUSY TO 
WASH THEIR HANDS AND PATIENTS TOLD 
TO GO TO THE TOIL NET THEIR BED NINETY NINETY OF ITS PATIENTS DIED FROM 
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE MORE THAN 
ONE THOUSAND INFECTED AFTER WARDS WERE 
LEFT FILTHY 
IT WAS HERE IN KENT 
THAT TWO OUTBREAKS OF CLOSTRIDIUM 
DIFFICILE LED TO THE DEATHS OF 
AROUND NINETY PENSIONERS IT IS A STORY 
OF UNDER STAFFING SLOPPY HYGIENE 
MANAGEMENT FAILURE BUT DISTURBINGLY 
THIS TRUST WASN'T ALONE IN FAILING 
ITS PATIENTS IT WASN'T EVEN THE 
WORST FOR C. DIFF DEATHS UP AND 
DOWN THE COUNTRY ELDERLY PEOPLE 
HAVE GONE INTO HOSPITAL FOR ONE 
THING ONLY TO BE FELLED BY ANOTHER 
A SUPERBUG THAT'S BEEN ALLOWED TO 
ADVANCE AT A TERRIFYING RATE 
IN NINETEEN NINETY THERE WERE JUST OVER ONE THOUSAND 
CASES OF C. DIFF REPORTED IN ENGLAND 
RISING TO OVER FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND BY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
SOME OF THESE WERE IN THE THREE 
HOSPITALS RUN BY THE MAIDSTONE AND 
TUNBRIDGE WELLS TRUST THESE SERVED 
A COMBINED POPULATION OF AROUND 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN WEST KENT AND 
PARTS OF NORTH EAST SUSSEX THEY 
HAD BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER AS PART 
OF A MERGER IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND ONE OF 
THE HOSPITALS THE KENT AND SUSSEX 
WAS KNOWN LOCALLY AS THE KENT AND 
SNUFF IT 
IT'S ONE OF THE REGION'S OLDEST 
ACUTE HOSPITALS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AFTER 
COMPLAINTS ABOUT ITS CLEANLINESS 
IT WAS THE FOCUS OF A B. B. C. SOUTH 
EAST INVESTIGATION 
JOURNALISTS DANIELLE GLAVIN WORKED 
UNDER COVER IN ACCIDENT AND AMP EMERGENCY 
FOR THE HOSPITAL MANAGED CLEANING 
SERVICE 
WE FOUND EVIDENCE OF SERVICE NEGLECT DRIED BLOOD LAYERS OF 
DUST DUST AND RUBBISH PILING NEWSPAPER 
CORRIDORS CORRIDORS NURSES HAVE TO WASH THEIR HANDS 
MORE THAN FIFTY TIMES A DAY BUT HOW 
CAN THEY IF THE HOSPITAL RUNS OUT 
OF SUPPLIES 
IT IS EMPTY 
I JUST GOT ASKED ABOUT MORE HAND TO 
YOUS BY A AND AMP E. 
WE HAVE NONE 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE ROSE GIBB HAD 
BEEN IN THE JOB FOR JUST SIX MONTHS 
HER MANAGEMENT OF THE HOSPITAL 
WOULD LATER BE SEVERELY CRITICISED 
BUT THEN SHE SOUNDED CONFIDENT I I WALK THE CORRIDORS ON A VERY 
REGULAR BASIS L. RE INFORCE WHAT 
POLICY SHOULD BE IT TAKES TIME TO 
GET SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT L. WILL 
NOT STOP UNTIL I GET THE STANDARDS 
THAT I BELIEVE THE POPULATION 
DESERVE DESERVE BUT THE DIRTY WARDS WERE 
EXACERBATING ANOTHER PROBLEM THE 
HOSPITAL INFECTION C. DIFFICILE WAS 
ON THE MARCH THE FIRST SERIOUS 
OUTBREAK WAS IN THE AUTUMN OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
WHEN AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PATIENTS WERE 
INFECTED WITH SYMPTOMS INCLUDING 
SEVERE DIARRHOEA ABDOMINAL CRAMPS 
FEVER DEHYDRATION IT IS 
HORRIBLE DISEASE NO ONE IS SURE 
EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE DIED OF THE 
INFECTION THOUGH BECAUSE AT THE 
TIME HOSPITAL STAFF DIDN'T EVEN 
REALISE IT WAS AN OUTBREAK 
DOCTOR CHRISTOPHER THOM HAS BEEN A 
CONSULTANT IN THE TRUST FOR THIRTEEN 
YEARS SPECIALISING IN CARE OF THE 
ELDERLY HE NOTICED AN INCREASE IN 
C. DIFF AMONG HIS OWN PATIENTS BUT 
DIDN'T REALISE THIS WAS PART OF 
LARGER PATTERN 
GOOD MORNING I'M DOCTOR THOM YOU 
CAN'T KEEP AWAY CAN YOU 
IT IS 
LIKE BUSES COMING ALONG YOU KNOW 
DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU SEE THREE 
WHETHER SUDDEN THRI THERE WILL BE A 
LOT MORE COMING AFTER THEM 
SUDDENLY THERE BE A LOT MORE COMING 
AFTER THEM AND NOT ANOTHER ONE FOR 
A COUPLE OF HOURS 
NOBODY WAS 
JOINING THE DOTS 
NO THERE WAS A 
FAILURE WITHIN THE TRUST WE DIDN'T 
HAVE A GOOD MECHANISM FOR COUNTING 
THE NUMBERS INFECTED AND FROM 
DRAWING CONCLUSIONS FROM IT 
THE FOLLOWING SPRING THERE WAS 
SECOND OUTBREAK MARY HIRST WAS ONE 
OF THE VICTIMS SHE WAS AN ACTIVE 
EIGHTY THREE YEAR OLD WHO STILL ENJOYED AN 
INDEPENDENT LIFE 
SHE DID THE GARDEN 
INDEPENDENT LIFE SHE DID THE GARDEN 
SHE DID MOST OF 
HER OWN SHOPPING NOT BIG SHOPPING 
BUT MOST OF 
HER OWN SHOPPING 
BUT MOST OF HER OWN SHOPPING 
FIGHTING FIT FINE 
BUT ON EIGHTH 
APRIL MARY HAD A FALL AND WAS 
RUSHED INTO MAIDSTONE HOSPITAL 
ON THE DAY THAT SHE FELL SHE WENT 
IN THE AMBULANCE AND TOOK SWEETS 
FOR THE PARAMEDICS SHE GAVE ALL 
THE PARAMEDICS SWEETS BEARING IN 
MIND SHE HAD BROKEN HER HIP SHE 
WAS DETERMINED SHE WASN'T GOING TO 
STAY IN HOSPITAL SHE HADN'T BROKEN 
IT SHE WOULD JUST GET IT X. RAYED 
AND COME HOME 
THEY OPERATED ON 
MARY RIGHT AWAY AND THE SURGERY WAS 
A SUCCESS 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE 
OPERATION SHE WAS IN GOOD FORM 
SITTING THERE PUTTING HER MAKE UP 
ON THE PHYSIO HAD GOT HER UP TO 
WALK IT WAS AFTER THAT THAT SHE 
SAID TO ME IN THE WARD THAT A LOT 
OF PEOPLE HAD GONE DOWN WITH A 
TUMMY BUG WHICH WE JUST THOUGHT IT 
WAS THEN A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER 
SHE TOO HAD A TUMMY BUG DAPHNE DAPHNE BURGESS ALSO DIED OF C. DIFFICILE IN 
THAT OUTBREAK 
SHE WAS ONLY SIXTY ONE WHEN SHE WAS 
ADMITTED TO MAIDSTONE WITH 
EMPHYSEMA AS A QUALIFIED NURSE 
HERSELF SHE WASN'T IMPRESSED BY 
WHAT SHE FOUND 
WHAT DID SHE THINK OF THE STANDARDS 
OF CLEANLINESS AROUND THE WARD 
WELL SHE NEVER REALLY MENTIONED 
CLEANLINESS ONLY THE FACT THAT 
THEY DIDN'T WASH THEIR HANDS ANY 
MORE LIKE THEY USED TO WHEN SHE WAS 
TRAINING SO SHE WAS STICKLER FOR 
THAT SHE INSISTED PEOPLE WASHED 
THEIR HANDS WHEN THEY SAW HER AND 
WASHED MY HANDS BEFORE I SAW HER 
WHEN HER HUSBAND ROBERT WENT IN TO 
VISIT HER HE FOUND HER WORRIED 
ABOUT ANOTHER PATIENT 
SHE SAID 
THAT A PERSON HAD BEEN MOVED FROM 
THE BED NEXT TO HER WHO HAD C. DIFF 
SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO CATCH IT 
AND SHE DID 
WHY DID SHE THINK SHE 
WOULD CATCH IT 
IT IS VERY 
INFECTIOUS INFECTIOUS THERE ARE NO BARRIERS PEOPLE JUST 
MOVE ALL AROUND THE WARDS DON'T 
THEY 
ON FIFTEENTH APRIL JACKIE WENT IN THEY TO VISIT HER MOTHER MARY HIRST 
BUT SHE HAD BEEN MOVED 
WHEN I GOT 
THERE ON THE SATURDAY I WALKED IN 
SHE WAS IN AN ISOLATION WARD 
BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD SHE HAD 
DIARRHOEA SHE WAS JUST LAYING 
THERE SOBBING WITH A MESS ALL UP 
HER HANDS UP HER ARMS DOWN HER 
FRONT AND SHE SAID TO ME JACKIE 
LOOK AT THE STATE OF ME NOBODY HAS 
CLEANED ME UP I HAVE MADE A MESS 
AND I'M SO EMBARRASSED L. JUST WENT 
OUT TO THE NURSES STATION AND ASKED 
ME FOR SOMEBODY TO COME AND HELP 
ME CLEAN MY MOTHER UP BECAUSE OF 
MOVING HER BECAUSE I'M NOT A NURSE 
I WENT TO HELP MUM A NURSE CAME 
AND THREW THE BOWL AT ME AND SAID 
DO IT YOURSELF WE HAVEN'T GOT TIME 
THEY ARE ALL LIKE IT 
STORIES ABOUT 
THE CARE AT THAT TIME ARE HARROWING 
SOME OF THE NURSING WAS 
INDEFENCEABLY POOR BUT THE TRUST 
WAS SHORT OF NURSING STAFF WITH C. 
DIFFICILE SPREADING LIKE WILDFIRE 
EVEN THE BEST NURSES FOUND IT 
IMPOSSIBLE TO CARE PROPERLY FOR 
ELDERLY PATIENTS SUFFERING MULTIPLE 
EPISODES OF DIARRHOEA 
SISTER YVONNE LONG WAS DEEPLY 
AFFECTED 
PATIENTS WOULD LAY IN AFFECTED THEIR BEDS AND THEY WOULD SEE THAT 
THE THEY WOULD SEE THE 
DIFFICULTIES WE WERE WORKING UNDER 
AND THEY WOULD FEEL UNABLE IT ASK 
FOR ANYTHING IF PATIENTS WANTED A 
COMMODE A BEDPAN IT MIGHT BE 
JUST WAIT A MINUTE WE WILL BE BACK 
IN A MINUTE BECAUSE WE HADN'T GOT 
THE STAFF TO DO IT RIGHT NOW WHICH 
IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO 
FIVE MINUTES O. K. 
WHAT DID THAT DO 
TO YOU AS A NURSE IT MADE ME 
EMBARRASSED ASHAMED TO BE IN A 
PROFESSION WHERE I WAS TRAINED TO 
BE A CARING PERSON BUT IN ACTUAL 
FACT I WASN'T GIVING THE CARE AT 
ALL IT WASN'T EVEN A STANDARD IT 
WAS BELOW STANDARD 
JOSEPH NIXON HAD FOUGHT FOR HIS 
COUNTRY HE WAS A VETERAN OF 
DUNKIRK EIGHTY SEVEN YEAR OLD JOSEPH CAUGHT 
C. DIFF AFTER A BOWEL PROCEDURE AND 
WAS NURSED IN A BUSY BAY WHERE 
NURSING RESOURCES WERE SEVERELY 
STRETCHED 
IT WAS HORRIBLE HE STRETCHED COPED WITH IT AS BEST HE COULD AND 
HE WAS ALWAYS ALWAYS FORGIVING AND 
HE UNDERSTOOD THEIR PROBLEMS AND HE 
KEPT SAYING DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME 
BUT ONE NIGHT HE ASKED FOR A BEDPAN 
THEY HADN'T GOT TIME TO GIVE IT TO 
THEM HE WAS LAYING IN HIS OWN 
EXCREMENT FOR TWO AND A HALF HOURS 
THEY SAID THAT I COULDN'T STAY ANY 
LONGER THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO HOME 
AND 
LEAVE HIM L. 
DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE HIM BUT THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE VALE ON THE 
SHIFT TO CLEAN HIM UP 
BOTH JOSEPH 
AND HIS DAUGHTER SYMPATHISED WITH 
THE NURSES 
I SAW A NURSE CRYING 
OVER BACKS ET OF LAUNDRY SHE SAID 
SHE HAD BEEN ON SHIFT FOR THREE 
HOURS AND ALL SHE HAD DONE WAS 
CLEAR BEDS OF EXCREMENT SHE JUST 
HAD THIS TROLLEY OF DIRTY LINEN 
SHE WAS JUST EXHAUSTED AFTER THREE 
HOURS 
C. DIFFICILE IS A HOURS PARTICULARLY NASTY DISEASE 
UNDIGNIFIED FOR THE PATIENT 
STRENGTH SAPPING FOR THE NURSES 
FOR ANY HUMAN BEING TO HAVE 
SOMETHING LIKE PROFUSE DIARRHOEA IN 
A PUBLIC AREA IS THE MOST DREADFUL 
THING THAT ANYBODY COULD EVER HAVE 
IT IS AWFUL WHEN YOU ARE ALL THE 
TIME YOU ARE CALLING FOR BEDPAN 
A COMMODE YOU ARE IN AN AREA WHERE 
THERE WAS MIXED BAYS OF MEN AND 
WOMEN OH IT WAS TERRIBLE IT IS 
TERRIBLE 
GOOD MORNING MRS. BISHOP TERRIBLE I'M DOCTOR THOM I'M THE CONSULTANT HOW 
ARE YOU FEELING 
EVEN THE 
CONSULTANTS FELT HELPLESS 
I HAVE 
HAD QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF 
PATIENTS WHO I HAVE HAD TO WATCH 
JUST GETTING WEAKER AND WEAKER WITH 
REPEATED RECUD SENSE OF DIARRHOEA 
DESPITE NIGH BEST EFFORTS TO TREAT 
THEM THEM BUT DOCTORS RECOGNISE IT WAS THE 
NURSES WHO BORE THE MAIN STRESS IT IT DOES INVOLVE REPEATEDLY CLEANING 
PATIENTS AND CHANGING BEDS THE 
WHOLE BASIS OF TRYING TO MAINTAIN 
CLEANLINESS WHILE UNDER A LOT OF 
STRESS AND DOING SEVERAL THINGS AT 
ONCE ALL THE MANY FACETS OF A 
NURSES' ROLE BUT STRETCHED 
SOMETIMES TO NEAR BREAKING POINT 
THE DISTRESS OF SOME RELATIVES WAS 
COMPOUNDED BY NEVER BEING TOLD WHAT 
WAS WRONG 
NINETY ONE YEAR OLD EMILY LANNING WAS 
ANOTHERED MAIDSTONE PATIENT WHO 
FELL VICTIM TO THE SUPERBUG 
SHE CONTRACTED C. DIFF AFTER GOING 
IN FOR A HIP OPERATION 
MY MOTHER I THINK WHEN SHE DIED 
WEIGHED ABOUT FIVE STONE BECAUSE 
SHE HAD LOST SO MUCH WEIGHT WHEN WHEN DID YOU REALISE THAT WHAT YOUR 
MOTHER DIED OF WAS C. DIFF 
WE DIDN'T UNTIL SHE DIED UNTIL IT 
WAS ON THE DEATH CERTIFICATE 
SO YOU HAD NO SENSE OF HOW SERIOUS 
IT WAS 
NO NOT AT ALL TEN WEEKS 
IN THERE AND SHE WAS GETTING NO 
BETTER AND I SAID TO THEM I 
THINK MY MOTHER IS GOING TO DIE IN 
HERE AND THEY JUST POO POOED IT 
AND TO SEE SOMEONE WITH C. DIFF 
WITH THE DIARRHOEA AND THE SICKNESS 
AND OH IT IS TERRIBLE TO WATCH 
AND I FEEL SO BITTER ABOUT IT THAT 
SHE HAD TO DIE THAT WAY 
IN FACT AS THE BACTERIUM HAS 
GAINED HOLD IN HOSPITALS ACROSS 
BRITAIN THE MORE COMMON PROBLEM 
HAS BEEN UNDER REPORTING OF C. DIFF 
ON DEATH CERTIFICATES 
PARTLY BECAUSE IN THE PRESENCE OF 
OTHER UNDERLYING DISEASES THE 
INFECTION ITSELF HAS NOT BEEN WELL 
UNDERSTOOD UNDERSTOOD ONE OF THE FEW SCIENTISTS IN THE U. K. 
TO HAVE BUILT UP DETAILED 
KNOWLEDGE OF C. DIFF IS PROFESSOR 
RICHARD JAMES HE'S SET UP A UNIQUE 
CENTRE IN NOTTINGHAM UNIVERSITY TO 
INVESTIGATE HOSPITAL INFECTIONS 
C. DIFF HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 
THOUSANDS OF YEARS IT HAS BEEN IN 
THE INTESTINES I'M SURE OF 
DINOSAURS TO MAN OVER THAT TIME 
PROBABLY WITHOUT CAUSING ANY 
SERIOUS PROBLEM AT ALL BUT IN 
RECENT YEARS THE ORGANISM HAS 
STARTED TO CHANGE AND CAUSE SEVERE 
INFECTIONS IN HUMANS 
THE REASONS 
FOR THE CHANGE INCLUDE OUR OVER USE 
OF ANTIBIOTICS AND THE TRANSMISSION 
OF THE DISEASE IN HOSPITALS 
C. DIFF OCCURS NATURALLY IN AROUND 
THREE PER CENT OF THE POPULATION INCLUDING 
MANY CHILDREN UNDER TWO 
THEY'RE NORMALLY PERFECTLY HEALTHY 
THE PROBLEMS START WHEN THE IMMUNE 
SYSTEM IS WEAKENED WE HAVE 
BACTERIA IN OUR INTESTINESS ALL 
COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER FOR 
GROWTH IN A NORMAL GUT C. DIFF WILL 
GET NOWHERE IT IS KEPT AT BAY BY 
THE HEALTHY BACTERIA BUT BROAD 
SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS HAVE A SCATTER 
GUN AFFECT THEY DESTROY THE BAD 
GUYS BUT THEY ALSO KILL OFF THE 
GOOD ONES 
WITH THE DEFENCES NOW C. DIFFICILE 
CAN NOW PROLIFERATE 
IT PRODUCES 
TOXINS TO WHICH CAUSES THE 
DIARRHOEA AND ATTACKS THE WALL OF 
THE COLON 
THIS BACTERIUM ALSO HAS 
AN EXTRAORDINARY CAPABILITY TO 
PROTECT ITSELF 
IT'S A GREAT 
SURVIVOR SO WHEN TIMES ARE HARD 
THE BACTERIAL CELLS FORM THESE 
HEAT RESISTANT SPORES THAT CAN 
SURVIVE FOR YEARS IN THE 
ENVIRONMENT AND THEN BREAK OUT OF 
DORMSY AND DORMANCY AND FORM 
BACTERIAL CELLS AGAIN THAT'S WHY 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO ELAMENATE FROM 
THE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT 
AT THE 
LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE AND 
TROPICAL MEDICINE PROFESSOR 
BRITISH ENERGY DEN 
HE SHOWED ME WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU 
PUT THE C. DIFF BACTERIUM INTO A 
POWERFUL DISINFREQUENTANT COMMONLY 
USE TO CLEAN HOSPITALS 
WE'VE LEFT 
IT FOR THIRTY MINUTES THE ORGANISM HAS 
FORMED SPORES WE PUT THE SAMPLES 
BACK IN HERE AT THE SPORES CAN 
GERMNATE AND FORM THESE COLONIES 
THAT'S AFTER BEING DISINFECTED YES YES THESE SURVIVED THE EFFECTS OF 
DISINFREQUENTANT 
HOW LONG CAN DISINFREQUENTANT SPORES EXIST THEN IN THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
THEY CAN EXIST FOR ENVIRONMENT MANY MANY YEARS 
PROFESSOR WREN'S 
RESEARCH HAS BROUGHT HIM INTO 
CONTACT WITH THE PARTICULARLY 
DEADLY STRAIN KNOWN AS OH TWO SEVEN WHICH 
SPREAD THROUGH THE MAIDSTONE 
HOSPITALS 
WE NOTICED IN THE FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN HOSPITALS STRAINS THESE ARE THE MORE 
VIRULENT STRAINS THAT THEY ARE 
DIFFERENT TO THE CONVENTIONAL 
STRAINS AND THEY'VE EVOLVED TO 
BECOME MORE TRANSMISSABLE MORE 
VIRULENT AND ALSO MORE ROBUST 
WHAT HAPPENS TO MAKE IT MORE 
VIRULENT 
WE DON'T KNOW KNOW VIRULENT EXACTLY WHAT MAKES IT MORE VIRULENT 
IT MAY PRODUCE MORE TOXIN WE KNOW 
IT READILY FORMS SPORES AND WE ALSO 
KNOW THAT IT SURVIVES STRESS A LOT 
MORE READILY 
VIRULENT STRAIN OF THE BACTERIA 
KNOWN AS C. DIFFICILE HAS HAS KILLED 
AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE SO FAR 
THE OH TWO SEVEN TYPE HAD BEEN SEEN BEFORE 
IN NORTH AMERICA 
WHERE IT APPEARED TO CAUSE MORE 
DEATHS WORSE ILLNESS AND MORE 
RELAPSES THAN OTHER STRAINS OF C. 
DIFF BY THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES WITH 
SPORES CARRIED ON POSSIBLY CLOTHES 
AND HANDS THIS STRAIN HAD ARRIVED 
IN EUROPE 
MOST OF THE HOSPITALS IN THE U. K. 
HAVE THE OH TWO SEVEN STRAIN THIS STRAIN IS 
PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HIGHER 
INCIDENCE OF DEATHS THAT'S BEEN 
REPORTED REPORTED THE PUBLIC WAS FIRST ALERTED TO THE 
PERIL OF OH TWO SEVEN BY TWO OUTBREAKS AT 
THE STOKE MANDEVILLE TRUST IN 
BUCKINGHAMSHIRE BUCKINGHAMSHIRE BETWEEN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND THREE AND JUNE TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR PATIENTS CONTRACTED C. DIFF IN 
HOSPITAL AND AT LEAST THIRTY THREE DIED 
THE SUPERBUG REACHED THE MAIDSTONE 
AND AMP TUNBRIDGE WELLS TRUST IN APRIL 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR BETWEEN THEN AND SEPTEMBER 
TWO THOUSAND SIX THERE WERE SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT CASES IN 
MAIDSTONE HOSPITAL THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE IN THE KENT 
AND AMP SUSSEX AND EIGHTY FIVE AT PENBURY 
HOSPITAL MOST CAME FROM THE OH TWO SEVEN 
STRAIN STRAIN THE HOSPITALS HAD DANGEROUSLY 
LITTLE SLACK IN THE SYSTEM TO COPE 
WITH THE CONTAGIOUS SUPERBUG BED 
OCCUPANCY AT MAIDSTONE HOSPITAL WAS 
RUNNING AT ABOUT NINETY FIVE PER CENT FOR ITS KEY 
MEDICAL WARDS SOMETIMES IT WAS AS 
HIGH AS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
THERE ARE ALL SORTS 
OF OF PROBLEMS THAT COME FROM THAT 
IT MEANS FOR ANY NEW PATIENT COMING 
INTO HOSPITAL THERE'S UNLIKELY TO 
BE A CHOICE OF BED IT MEANS 
BECAUSE THINGS HAVE TO BE JIGELLED 
UP THE PATIENTS MOVE WARDS AND A 
LOT OF OUR PATIENTS MOVE WARDS 
MULTIPLE TIMES AND THAT'S NEVER 
GOOD FOR A PATIENT SO WE HAVE 
REALLY STRUGGLED WITH THE VERY HIGH 
AND CLEARLY THIS COMBINED WITH 
WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE INADEQUATE 
NURSING NUMBERS HAS MADE WARD CARE 
LESS GOOD THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
LINDA SOMERFIELD WAS THE ASSOCIATE 
NURSE DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF THE TWO 
MATRONS AT MAIDSTONE AND KENT AND AMP 
SUSSEX HOSPITALS WERE OCCUPANCY 
RATES TOO HIGH DID YOU HAVE ENOUGH 
SLACK IN THE SYSTEM AS YOU WERE 
SUPPOSED TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH 
SUDDEN MERJS 
I THINK THE STAFF 
WOULD SAY THE GENERAL FEELING IS 
THAT THEY FELT UNDER SIGNIFICANT 
PRESSURE IT FELT AT THE TIME THAT 
WE WERE UNDER SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE 
SO THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH SPARE BEDS 
TO DEAL WITH THE C. DIFF CRISIS WHEN 
IT AROSE POSSIBLY 
WAS ANYBODY POSSIBLY COME TO THE WARDS AND ACTUALLY 
SEEING HOW THE PATIENTS WERE 
EXISTING 
WE DID SEE SOME OF THE EXISTING EXACT DIRECTORS EXEC DIRECTORS 
BUT WHAT WE DIDN'T SEE AT THAT TIME 
WAS ACTION 
AND WHAT 
ACTION DID YOU WANT THE THE ACTION WE WANTED WAS FOR DIRECTORS 
TO SEE THE PRESSURES THAT NURSING 
STAFF WERE WORKING UNDER 
IT'S NOW CLEAR THAT PATIENT CARE 
WAS COMPROMISED BY A SEVERE 
SHORTAGE OF NURSING STAFF A REPORT 
THE PREVIOUS YEAR HAS SUGGESTED 
THAT AS MANY AS NINE OUT OF EVERY 
TEN MUCH ITS MEDICAL AND SURGICAL 
WARDS WERE UNDERSTAFFED EVEN 
INCLUDING AGENCY STAFF THESE WARDS 
HAD A SEVENTEEN PER CENT SHORTFALL OF NURSES 
COMPARED TO AN ASSUMED NATIONAL 
AVERAGE 
MENT NURSES HERE WERE AVERAGE WORKING VERY HARD AND THEY CONTINUE 
TO WORK HARD BUT IT'S TRUE WE 
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH ENOUGH NURSES 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT IT WAS 
LIKE FOR NURSES ON THE WARDS AT 
THAT TIME WHEN SO MANY PATIENTS 
WERE SUFFERING FROM C. DIFF 
I THINK 
NURSES WERE FEELING EXHAUSTED THEY 
WERE CERTAINLY FEELING UNDER VALUED 
AND IN SOME AREAS OF THE 
ORGANISATION I THINK THEY WERE 
FEELING SIGNIFICANTLY UNSUPPORTED 
WE WERE JUST POWERLESS WE HAD NO 
WAY OF KHAIPKT THE SITUATION WE 
TRIED WE TRIED 
BUT IT BECAME A SITUATION WHERE IT 
WAS MORE BETWEEN OURSELVES INSTEAD 
OF HIGHER UP BECAUSE WE BECAME 
INTO THE ATTITUDE THAT NOTHING 
WOULD BE DONE ANYWAY SO WHAT WAS 
THE POINT 
WHY WERE YOU AS A SENIOR 
CLINICIAN NOT BANGING ON DOORS OF 
MANAGEMENT AND SAYING THIS IS 
DISGRACEFUL DO SOMETHING ABOUT 
IT 
WELL I DID SAY THINGS ALONG IT THOSE LINES ON A NUMBER OF 
OCCASIONS AND I WASN'T THE ONLY 
ONE WHO DID L. THINK THERE WAS A 
FAIRLY WIDE RECOGNITION WITHIN THE 
ORGANISATION THAT YES IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE MORE NURSES 
ON THE WARDS I THINK THAT WAS 
RECOGNISED THERE WAS A GAP BETWEEN 
THAT AND ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING 
ABOUT IT 
BUT WHAT WERE THE TRUST'S BOARD OF 
MANAGEMENT DOING WHILE INFECTION 
WAS RAMPAGING THROUGH THE 
UNDERSTAFFED WARDS IT SEEMS THE 
ATTENTION OF THE FIVE LAY AND TEN 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS UNDER THE 
LEADERSHIP OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE ROSE 
GIBB WAS ELSEWHERE 
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD WAS JAMES 
LEE HIS JOB WAS TO HOLD THE 
MANAGEMENT TEAM TO ACCOUNT 
WE TRIED AS A NON EXECUTIVE GROUP 
TO PUT AS MUCH PRESSURE ON AS WE 
COULD BUT REMEMBER I DON'T WANT 
TO SEE LIKE USING THIS AS AN EXCUSE 
AT ALL MONEY WAS AT THE HEART OF 
ALL OF THIS THE WHOLE ORGANISATION 
WAS SCRATCHING AND SCRAPING FOR 
SAVINGS IN ALMOST ANYTHING THAT IT 
COULD FIND AND THAT WAS THE 
CULTURE THAT IS WHAT WAS GOING ON 
IN THE N. H. S. 
THE BOARD WAS WRESTLING 
WITH COST SAVINGS RESTRUCTURING 
ITS SERVICES AND GETTING AGREEMENT 
FOR A NEW PRIVATE FINANCE 
INITIATIVE OR PFI HOSPITAL ALL 
AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF 
COMMANDING GOVERNMENT TARGETS BUT 
IS GOOD MANAGEMENT NOT ABOUT 
BALANCING CONFLICTING PRIORITIES 
AND MAKING SURE THAT THE ONE CORE 
CENTRAL THING THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD 
BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHICH IS THE 
LIVES OF PATIENTS SHOULD BE PUT 
FIRST 
I AGREE WITH THAT THAT IS FIRST EXACTLY THE ROLE OF MANAGEMENT SO SO MANAGEMENT FAILED TO THAT EXTENT 
CLEARLY IT DID YES 
AS THE TRUST'S 
SECOND C. DIFF OUTBREAK TOOK HOLD IN 
APRIL TWO THOUSAND SIX THE DEATH TOLL WAS 
RISING RISING FOR THE PATIENTS IN THE CROWDED 
WARDS THINGS WERE BECOMING 
UNBEARABLE UNBEARABLE THERE WERE PEOPLE AROUND HER DYING 
ALL THE TIME 
YES IN THE SECOND 
WARD YES COMMONPLACE 
A LOT OF COMMONPLACE WE DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF BODIES 
THAT'S THE WRONG WORD WE SAW 
LOT OF BOXES WITH BODIES IN THAT 
WERE COVERED OVER AND WE ACTUALLY 
JOKED THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE A DEAL 
WITH THE UNDERTAKE BECAUSE THEY 
THEY WE SAW SO MANY BODIES GOING 
OUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE WE KNEW 
BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE THERE FOR 
SEVEN AND A HALF WEEKS WE GOT TO 
SEE A LOT OF RELATIVES A LOT OF 
THE PEOPLE WE DIDN'T KNOW AND 
THERE MUST BE LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT 
WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT HAD DIED WITH 
IT IT IT'S SAD 
JACKIE AND CAROL'S MOTHER MARY 
HIRST WOULD SOON DIE HERSELF OF 
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE SOME OF THE 
STAFF ARE STILL HAUNTED BY THEIR 
INABILITY TO NURSE THOSE PATIENTS 
AS THEY WANTED TO 
I FEEL A BIT 
SICK REALLY L. FEEL A BIT SICK TO 
THINK THAT ACTUALLY THOSE THAT 
WAS ACTUALLY GOING ON AND I WAS 
PART OF IT 
I WAS PART OF IT 
I'M NOT A GOODY TWO SHOES AND I 
DON'T PROFESS TO BE THE MOST 
PERFECT NURSE IN THE WHOLE WIDE 
WORLD BUT THESE PEOPLE NEED CARE 
AND WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GIVE IT 
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS CONFUSION OVER 
EXACTLY HOW MANY PATIENTS HAD DIED 
OF C. DIFF THE GRAVITY OF THE 
OUTBREAK WAS AT LAST BEGINNING TO 
BE UNDERSTOOD 
I THINK THAT WAS THE TURNING POINT 
THE BEGINNING OF APRIL TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN 
WE DID RECOGNISE THE SIGNIFICANT OF 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NUMBER OF 
PATIENTS WITH CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE 
AND AT THAT POINT WE DID START TO 
HAVE MEETINGS WITH THE HEALTH 
PROTESTANT EGGS AGENCY THE THE INDEPENDENT HEALTH PROTESTANT EGGS 
AGENCY SENT IN THEIR OWN 
TROUBLESHOOTER TROUBLESHOOTER DOCTOR SARAH MUMFORD A QUALIFIED 
MICROBIOLOGIST WAS LOOKING AT HOW 
THE TRUST WAS DEALING WITH THE 
OUTBREAK AT A MEETING IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIX 
SHE WAS PRESENTED WITH A LIST OF 
PATIENTS WHO SUFFERED FROM C. DIFF 
AND LATER DIED 
I WAS CONCERNED THAT IT WAS 
PRESENTED TO ME IN VERY MATTER 
OF FACT WAY HERE'S THE LIST IT 
WASN'T QUALIFIED IN SAYING WHETHER 
OR NOT ANYBODY HAD DEFINITELY DIED 
OF C. DIFF THE NUMBERS SEMTD 
CONFUSING THERE WAS A LACK OF 
CLARITY AROUND THE DEATHS AND HOW 
MANY PATIENTS HAD BEEN INFECTED DOCTOR DOCTOR MUMFORD REALISED MANY RELATIVES 
DIDN'T KNOW THE FULL CIRCUMSTANCES 
OF HOW THEIR LOVED ONES HAD DIED I I WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT WE HAD A 
SITUATION WHICH WAS GOING TO CAUSE 
A LOT OF ANGUISH TO RELATIVES THAT 
WAS POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE IN SCALE 
AND THAT THERE WAS STILL A LACK OF 
REALISATION OF HOW SEVERE THE 
SITUATION COULD POSSIBLY BE HER HER CONCERNS WERE PASSED TO ENGLAND'S 
HOSPITAL WATCHDOG THE HEALTH CARE 
COMMISSION COMMISSION HERE AT ITS LONDON HEADQUARTERS 
INVESTIGATION MANAGER DOCTOR HEATHER 
WOOD WAS ASSIGNED TO FIND OUT WHAT 
WAS GOING WRONG IN THE MAIDSTONE 
AND TUNBRIDGE WELLS TRUST IN 
OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SIX SHE LED A TEAM OF 
SEVEN INVESTIGATORS INTO THE 
HOSPITALS THE INVESTIGATION WOULD 
TAKE MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AND COVER 
A PERIOD GOING BACK TWO AND A HALF 
YEARS YEARS ALTHOUGH MANAGERS KNEW THESE 
INSPECTORS WERE COMING THE 
SHORTCOMINGS 
WERE STILL OBVIOUS WE WE WERE DISCONCERTED THAT THE 
ENVIRONMENT IN MANY AREAS WAS STILL 
POOR THE DAY CORE WAS DETECTIVE 
CONSTABLEOR WAS RATHER DECOR WAS 
RATHER SAD IN MANY WARDS THE BEDS 
WERE SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT 
LITERALLY A PATIENT COULD REACH OUT 
AND TOUCH A PATIENT IN THE 
NEIGHBOURING BED NOT ONLY PERHAPS 
DISCONCERTING FOR PATIENTS BUT OF 
COURSE MAKING THINGS VERY 
DIFFICULT TO CLEAN WE ALSO FOUND 
THAT THE WARDS WERE KLURTERED AND 
UNTIDY THE TRUST WAS STILL USING 
EQUIPMENT THAT HAD BEEN CONDEMNED 
INCLUDING COME MODES AND WE COULD 
SEE BED PANS VISIBLY CONTAMINATED 
WITH FAECES 
IT'S AN APPALLING CATALOGUE HOW 
SHOCKED WERE YOU BY IT 
WELL WE 
WERE SHOCKED AND WE WERE 
PARTICULARLY SHOCKED BECAUSE THESE 
ARE THINGS WE FOUND WHILE AN 
INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY 
I MEAN WOULD YOU EXPECT WOULDN'T 
YOU THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE SHIP 
SHAPE SHAPE SARAH MUMFORD WAS TRYING TO PUT 
THESE THINGS RIGHT NOWADAYS SHE'S 
THE TRUST INFECTION CONTROL 
DIRECTOR AND HAS REGULAR MEETINGS 
TO PRE EMPT THE KIND OF PROBLEMS 
SHE ENCOUNTERED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
IF WE 
COMPARE TWO THOUSAND SIX AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE 
IMPROVEMENT IS 
BACK THEN SHE 
IMPROVEMENT IS FORTY TWO PER CENT BACK THEN SHE FOUND HERSELF HITTING A BRICK WALL 
THERE SEEMED TO BE THIS PERPETUAL 
LACK OF ADEQUATE STAFFING LEVELS 
WE WANTED TO HAVE ISOLATION WARDS 
THERE WAS CONSTANT PROBLEM WITH 
CAN WE STAFF THE WARD WHAT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY WERE BROUGHT TO 
THE MEETINGS THESE CONCERNS IT IT WAS ALWAYS LET'S TRY AND FIND 
SOME MORE BANK STAFF LET'S TRY AND 
FIND SOME MORE AGENCY STAFF IT 
WAS A PROBLEM WITHOUT AN ANSWER AT 
THAT TIME 
THE SUPERBUG THAT EXPOSED THE 
INADEQUACIES OF CONTROL AT 
MAIDSTONE IS DIFFICULT ONE TO 
FIGHT BECAUSE IT SPREADS SO EASILY 
I HAVE COME TO BRADFORD WHERE 
MULTI DISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM IS 
TRYING TO BE UNDERSTAND HOW IT 
OPERATES OPERATES IN HIS STATE OF THE ART PATHOGEN 
CHAMBER ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN 
EUROPE ENGINEER AND PROFESSOR OF 
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY CLIVE BEGGS HAS 
BEEN TRACKING THE BACTERIUM'S 
MOVEMENTS THE SEALED ROOM KEEPS 
THE BUGS IN WE HAVE A COMMODE HERE 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THAT 
WE ARE GOING TO ILLUSTRATE HOW MIEB 
ROBES CAN BE TRAMSMITTED AROUND THE 
ENVIRONMENT MICROBES WE HAVE 
INOCULATED THIS SURFACE WITH AN 
ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT DYE YOU CAN'T 
SEE IT NORMLY THIS GIVES AN 
ILLUSTRATION OF A SURFACE REALLY 
CONTAMINATED WITH C. DIFF L. WOULD 
LIKE YOU TO GRAB HOLD OF THAT GRAB 
HOLD FIRMLY AND RUB YOUR HAND ON 
IT NOW LET'S SEE IF IT'LL 
CONTAMINATE SOMETHING OVER HERE 
CHANGING THIS BED 
YES PRESSING 
THAT LET'S SEE IF YOU HAVE LEFT 
ANY CHAIN SHOW YOUR HAND AND WE 
WILL SEE IF THERE IS ANY ON HERE 
LOOK AT THAT CAN YOU SEE IT ALL 
OVER THERE 
I CERTAINLY CAN LET'S LET'S SEE ANY DOWN HERE THERE YOU CAN 
SEE IT SHINING 
I HAVE TRANSFERRED 
IT STRAIGHT FROM THERE TO HERE AND 
IF I SHOOK HANDS WITH YOU SAY 
LET'S SHAKE HANDS AND SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS I SUSPECT THERE WILL BE 
DYE ON ME AS WELL THERE YOU CAN 
SEE IT ON THE SIDE THERE A LOT 
ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF C. 
DIFF INFECTION IS THAT THE PATIENT 
IN THIS BED HERE TOUCHES THIS AND 
IT IS CONTAMINATED THEY 
CONTAMINATE THE HANDS THEY THEN 
TOUCH THEIR MOUTH OR EAT SOME FOOD 
THE SPORES WILL GO DOWN INTO THEIR 
GUT THEY WILL SURVIVE THE ACID IN 
THE STOMACH AND COLONISE THEIR GUT 
COULD THIS BE WHAT HAPPENED AT THE 
MAIDSTONE TRUST TO SPREAD C. DIFF 
AMONG SO MANY PATIENTS SNB THE 
HEALTHCARE COMMISSION'S REPORT WAS 
PUBLISHED ON ELEVENTH OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IT 
WAS DAMNING OVER ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED CASE AN 
ESTIMATED NINETY DEATHS SCATHING 
CRITICISM OF THE 
MAY I ASK THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH TO 
MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT CLOSTRIDIUM 
DIFFICILE DIFFICILE THE HEALTHCARE COMMISSION'S REPORT 
INTO THE OUTBREAKS OF CLOSTRIDIUM 
DIFFICILE AT MAIDSTONE AND TUN 
BRIDGES WELLS N. H. S. TRUST IS A TRULY 
SHOCKING DOCUMENT 
TUN BRIDGES WELLS N. H. S. TRUST ON 
BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT AND 
NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE I WOULD 
LIKE TO APOLOGISE TO ALL THOSE WHO 
HAVE BEEN TURNLLY AFFECT AND TO 
OFFER MY WHO HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY 
AFFECTED AND TO OFFER MY 
CONDOLENCES TO THOSE FAMILIES OF 
THOSE WHO HAVE DIED 
THE REPORT 
ACCUSED THE MANAGEMENT OF 
CONCENTRATING ON FINANCIAL 
PROGRAMMES LIKE THE NEW PFI 
BUILDING AND MEETING TARGETS THE THE EYE MANAGEMENT WAS ON STRATEGIC 
OBJECTIVES AND NOT ON PATIENTS 
WHAT WAS YOUR OPINION OF THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE AND HOW SHE RAN THAT 
BOARD 
WELL AGAIN I THINK SHE RAN BOARD THAT BOARD IN A WAY THAT WAS 
FOCUSED ON THESE STRATEGIC 
OBJECTIVES AND WHEREAS NOBODY 
COULD ARGUE THEY WERE IMPORTANT I 
THINK IT MEANT THAT YOU KNOW 
INSUFFICIENT ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO 
PROBLEMS ON THE WARDS DAY TO DAY 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE ROSE GIBB 
RESIGNED THE WEEK BEFORE THE REPORT 
WAS PUBLISHED SHE REFUSED TO BE 
INTERVIEWED FOR THIS PROGRAMME BUT 
IN A LETTER TO PANORAMA SHE SAID 
THE BOARD INHERITED A HUGE RANGE OF 
LONG STANDING PROBLEMS AFFECTING 
PATIENT CARE 
SHE STATES SHE ALSO SAYS SHE DIDN'T LEAVE HER 
POST WILLINGLY SHE WANTED TO STAY 
AND ACCOUNT TO THE PUBLIC 
I HAVE 
INSTRUCTED THE TRUST IN THIS 
EXCEPTIONAL CASE TO WITHHOLD ANY 
SEARCHES PAYMENT TO THE FORMER 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF MAIDSTONE AND 
TUNBRIDGE WELLS N. H. S. TRUST PENDING 
LEGAL ADVICE 
ROSE GIBB HAD EXPECTED FULL 
COMPENSATION FOR LOSING HER 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR JOB SHE HAS NOW 
RECEIVED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND IS SUING THE 
TRUST FOR MORE 
SHE NOW RUNS A HOSPITAL CONSULTCY 
COMPANY WITH HER HUSBAND ON THEIR 
WEBSITE IN A PHRASE THAT HAS 
INFURIATED BEREAVED RELATIVES SHE 
BOASTS WE HAVE THE T. SHIRT AND 
THE SCARS HAS ROSE GIBB THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE BEEN UNFAIRLEY 
SCAPEGOATED OR ARE SOME OF THE CRIT 
SICHS VALID 
WELL OBVIOUSLY QUITE A 
LOT OF THE CRITICISMS MUST BE VALID 
BUT I THINK SHE HAS BEEN HELD OUT 
AS BEING SOME SORT OF WICKED WITCH 
OF THE NORTH TO BE SLIGHTLY 
TRIVIAL FOR A SECOND EVEN THE 
SELECTION OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF HER 
MAKE HER LOOK LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF 
THE ADDAMS FAMILY AND SHE IS NOT 
THAT SHE RAN A VERY VERY TIGHT 
SHIP SHE WAS A TAKE NO PRISONERS 
TYPE OF MANAGER BUT THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRED THAT WHEN WHEN JAMES LEE STEPPED DOWN ON FOURTEENTH 
OCTOBER ALAN JOHNSTON'S REACTION 
WAS TO THE POINT 
I CAN TELL THE HOUSE THAT JAMES LEE 
THE CHAIR OF THE TRUST TRUST HAS 
TODAY OFFERED HIS RESIGNATION 
WHICH 
I HAVE ACCEPTED I WAS 
ABSOLUTELY APPALLED BY THE REPORT 
I FELT PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE 
BECAUSE I HAD BEEN THE CHAIRMAN OF 
THE TRUST FOR FOUR FOUR AND A HALF 
YEARS AT THE TIME L. THINK THE FACT 
THAT NINETY PEOPLE DIED WHETHER THESE 
DEATHS WERE INEVITABLE OR 
UNNECESSARY DOESN'T MATTER THEY 
WERE OLD PEOPLE WHO DIED UNDER 
PRETTY DREADFUL CIRCUMSTANCES 
IT IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO DIE AND 
SO I FELT VERY BAD ABOUT IT AT THE 
TIME AND I STILL FEEL VERY BAD 
ABOUT IT 
JAMES LEE BELIEVES DEPARTMENT OF 
HEALTH TARGETS WERE REROOT OF WHAT 
WENT WRONG THESE REQUIRED ALL 
HOSPITAL TRUSTS IN ENGLAND TO GET 
WAITING TIMES IN ACCIDENT AND 
EMERGENCY DOWN TO FOUR HOURS IT 
MEANT FINDING EXTRA BEDS IN ALREADY 
OVER CROWDED HOSPITALS 
WE WERE CAUGHT IN A SQUEEZE BETWEEN 
A LOT MORE PEOPLE ARRIVING AT THE 
FRONT DOOR TO SOME EXTENT 
FUNCTION OF THE CHANGES IN GENERAL 
PRACTICE AND AN INCREASING 
SQUEEZING OF THE GOVERNMENT'S 
TARGETS FOR WAITING LISTS AND 
WAITING TIME AND NO MORE MONEY SO 
IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT THE BOARD 
SPENT A LOT OF TIME STRUGGLING WITH 
THAT WE ACTUALLY HAD TO SAVE FORTY THREE 
MILLION OVER THREE YEARS AND THAT 
WAS NOT EASY 
I HOPE THAT THE HOUSE WILL 
RECOGNISE THAT THE AWFUL FAILURES 
IN MAIDSTONE AND TUNBRIDGE ARE 
ENTIRELY UNREPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
STANDARDS OF CARE THAT PATIENTS AND 
THE PUBLIC RIGHTLY EXPECT AND THAT 
IS DELIVERED IN HOSPITALS ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY DAY AFTER DAY 
ALAN JOHNSTON SAID WHAT HAPPENED AT 
MAIDSTONE WASN'T TYPICAL WAS HE 
RIGHT 
NO IT 
WAS RUBBISH THE TRUTH RIGHT WAS THAT DURING THE PERIOD IN 
QUESTION PROBABLY ABOUT NINE THOUSAND 
PEOPLE DIED IN THE U. K. FROM 
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE SO WE WERE 
LESS THAN ONE PER CENT OF THOSE DEATHS EVEN 
AT THE PEAK OF THE CRISIS THERE 
WERE TWELVE TRUSTS TWELVE HOSPITAL TRUSTS 
UNTIL THE U. K. WORSE THAN US SO THIS 
IS NOT TO EXCUSE WHAT HAPPENED BUT 
IT IS TO SAY THAT I THINK WHAT 
JOHNSON DID WAS A COMPLETE TRAVESTY 
BECAUSE HE GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT 
THIS WAS SOMETHING UNUSUAL 
ALAN JOHNSON DECLINED TO ANSWER 
THIS CHARGE SO I ASKED HIS UNDER 
SECRETARY A. N. N. KEEN HERSELF A 
FORMER NURSE WHY HE'D INSISTED THE 
MAIDSTONE TRUST WAS 
UNREPRESENTATIVE 
BECAUSE IT IS UNREPRESENTATIVE TRUE IT WAS AS SERIOUS AS YOU 
COULD GET THE HEALTH COMMISSION 
REPORT ON THAT WAS THE MOST SERIOUS 
DOCUMENT I HAVE EVER READ 
EVERYBODY HAS A DUTY OF CARE YOU 
HAVE A DUTY TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND 
TO SHOW LEADERSHIP INTO HOW TO DO 
THAT 
YET THAT TRUST WAS ONLY THAT BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE AND TWENTY ONE FOR C. DIFF 
INFECTION RATES IN ENGLAND TAT DO 
YOU NOT THINK IT WAS A TINY BIT 
UNFAIR THAT THAT TRUST SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN HELD UP FOR CENSURE BY THE 
GOVERNMENT 
I HAVEN'T HEALED IT UP GOVERNMENT THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T THE HEALTH 
COMMISSION HASN'T 
ALAN JOHNSON 
HELD IT UP FOR CENSURE 
IT WAS 
RIGHT THAT HE DID IT WAS VERY 
SERIOUS WHAT HAPPENED WAS VERY 
VERY SERIOUS IT IS RIGHT THAT THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE DID THAT BUT 
THE HEALTH COMMISSION HE WAS ONLY 
ACTING ON THE HEALTH COMMISSION'S 
REPORT 
CERTAINLY THERE IS NOTHING REPORT TO SUGGEST THAT MAIDSTONE AND 
TUNBRIDGE WELLS TRUST WAS ALONE IN 
SUCCUMBING TO C. DIFFICILE 
INDEED PROFESSOR JAMES IN 
NOTTINGHAM POINTS OUT THAT RATES IN 
THIS COUNTRY ARE CONSIDERABLY WORSE 
THAN ANYWHERE ELSE 
THE FIGURES FOR C. DIFF SHOW THAT 
MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT OF HOSPITAL TRUSTS IN 
THE U. K. HAVE RATE OF INFECTION 
THAT'S MORE THAN TEN TIMES THAT OF 
ANY OTHER COUNTRY YES SO IT IS 
WORSE HERE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS WE ARE DOING 
ABOUT THE SAME AS OTHER COUNTRIES 
OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES YES YES WELL I THINK IT DEPENDS WHICH SET 
OF FIGURES YOU ARE LOOKING AT 
CERTAINLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE OVER 
SIXTY FIVES WHICH ARE THE GROUP WHERE 
THERE ARE MORE DEATHS THEN WE HAVE 
MORE CASES THERE AND THEREFORE MORE 
DEATHS IN THAT AGE GROUP THAN ANY 
OTHER K. U. N. IN THE WORLD BY A FACTOR 
OF TEN 
ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE 
WORLD THAT'S AN EXTRAORDINARILY 
BAD SITUATION IT WAS ANNOUNCED 
THIS WEEK THAT C. DIFF INFECTIONS IN 
ENGLAND FELL BY EIGHT PER CENT BETWEEN OCTOBER 
AND DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HOWEVER THE WAY 
CASES ARE COUNTED HAS CHANGED AND 
EXPERTS CALCULATE THAT THE REAL 
FIGURE IS ACTUALLY BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND 
THIRTY FIVE PER CENT HIGHER THAN THIS MAKING A 
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE LAST 
QUARTER QUARTER IN SCOTLAND TOO THE NUMBER OF 
CASES WENT UP BY TEN PER CENT 
AND IN NORTHERN IRELAND THERE WAS A 
HEFTY RISE OF ALMOST THIRTY SIX PER CENT 
COMPARABLE FIGURES FOR WALES AREN'T 
OUT YET 
STILL THERE IS NOW AN INCREASED 
FOCUS ON INFECTION CONTROL ACROSS 
THE U. K. 
IN ENGLAND AN EXTRA TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION 
WAS ALLOCATED TO RECRUIT FIVE THOUSAND 
MATRONS HIRE MORE INFECTION 
CONTROL STAFF AND CLEAN UP DIRTY 
HOSPITALS HOSPITALS NORTH OF THE BORDER THE SCOTTISH 
GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN HEALTH BOARDS 
FIFTY FOUR MILLION TO FIGHT THE SUPERBUGS 
BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE 
IT ALL 
BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT ALL MAKE UNDER THE FREEDOM OF 
INFORMATION ACT WE ASKED EVERY 
ACUTE TRUST IN ENGLAND WALES AND 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE HEALTH 
BOARDS IN SCOTLAND WHAT THEY ARE 
DOING TO PROTECT THEIR PATIENTS OF 
THE OF THE TWO HUNDRED FOUR APPROACHED ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY 
REPLIED A TOTAL OF EIGHTY THREE PER CENT 
FIRST WE ASKED ABOUT BED OCCUPANCY 
RATES RATES TOO MANY BEDS TOO CLOSE TOGETHER 
PLAYED A PART IN MAIDSTONE'S 
TRAGEDY TRAGEDY THE TRUST HAS NOW GOT RID OF FOURTEEN 
BEDS ACROSS THE HOSPITALS 
INCLUDING HERE AT THE CAN'T AND AND 
SUSSEX 
CERTAINLY IN WARD EIGHT AS YOU SUSSEX SAW FROM THE HEALTHCARE COMMISSION 
REPORT ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS WAS 
IN RELATION TO HOW CLOSE TOGETHER 
THE BEDS WERE 
THIS IS WHERE THE 
PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN 
YES IT WAS 
TAKEN STRAIGHT AHEAD I UNDERSTAND 
THERE WERE TWO BEDS STRAIGHT ON 
THERE THERE WERE TWO HERE AND TWO 
HERE SO THAT MADE THAT SIX AND 
THERE ARE NOW THREE BEDS IN HERE 
THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY CLOSE 
TOGETHER WASN'T IT 
IT WAS VERY 
CLOSE TOGETHER 
DO YOU THINK THEY 
ARE WIDE ENOUGH APART NOW 
YES YES 
I DO L. THINK IN THIS AREA IT'S 
FINE I THINK IN RELATION TO THE 
REST OF THE WARD I STILL THINK 
SOME OF THESE BEDS ARE STILL TOO 
CLOSE TOGETHER 
SO YOU NEED FEWER 
BEDS EVEN NOW 
THAT WOULD BE MY 
WISH THAT THERE WERE FEWER BEDS 
WE ASKED WHAT IS THE AVERAGE BED 
OCCUPANCY RATE IN YOUR TRUST OVER 
THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS THE ANSWER FORTY NINE 
TRUSTS WERE BETWEEN NINETY TO ONE HUNDRED PER CENT FORTY FIVE 
WERE BETWEEN EIGHTY FIVE TO NINETY PER CENT THAT MEANS 
CLEAR MAJORITY OF U. K. HOSPITALS HAVE 
MORE THAN EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF THEIR BEDS 
OCCUPIED WHICH IS NOT IDEAL FOR 
INFECTION CONTROL 
EXPERTS WOULD 
SAY IF YOU GO ABOVE EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT BED 
OCCUPANCY RATES THEN THAT IS NOT 
CONDUCIVE TO GOOD CONTROL OF 
INFECTION MEASURES THAT DOESN'T 
MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU WILL GET MORE 
INFECTIONS IT JUST MAKES IT MORE 
DIFFICULT WHAT THAT MEANS IN 
PRACTICE IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A BED 
THAT'S BEING OCCUPIED BY A PATIENT 
THAT HAS MRSA OR C. DIFF INFECTION 
THEN THERE ISN'T TIME TO TAKE THAT 
ROOM OUT OF COMMISSION TO TAKE THE 
BED AWAY TO REPLACE IT WITH ONE 
THAT HAS BEEN DECONTAMINATED 
CHANGE ALL THE BEDDING AND WARD 
CURTAINS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THERE 
ISN'T TIME TO DO THAT 
IN MAIDSTONE 
HOSPITAL THEY NOW HAVE A SPECIAL 
ISOLATION WARD FOR PATIENTS WHO 
HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH C. DIFF 
IT'S RUN BY WARD MANAGER VICKY 
SCOTT 
AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE GOT TWO BAYS 
THIS IS THE LADIES' BAY IT IS A 
SIX BEDDED BAY BUT IT HAS FIVE 
PATIENTS IN AT THE MOMENT THE BED 
THAT'S NOT OCCUPIED WHICH IS THE 
ONE NEAREST THIS WINDOW DOESN'T 
HAVE I V. ANY SOFT FURNISHINGS IT 
DOESN'T HAVE MATTRESS SO WHEN WE 
KNOW WE HAVE ANOTHER LADY IN 
SHOULD THAT HAPPEN WE WILL GET 
MATTRESS AND PREPARE THAT BED AREA 
BUT WE DON'T WANT ANY ENVIRONMENT 
THAT WOULD HOST THE INFECTION 
ANOTHER WAY OF REDUCING THE SPREAD 
OF INFECTION IS ALL OUR RELATIVES 
ARE WEARING GLOVES AND APRONS THE 
NURSES ARE WEARING THEM AND THE 
PHYSIOTHERAPISTS COME TO THIS WARD 
AT THE END OF THEIR WORKING DAY 
BECAUSE IF THEY COME TO THIS WARD 
FIRST IT IS NOT PRUDENT FOR THE 
SPREAD OF INFECTION POINT OF VIEW 
FOR THEM TO SEE OTHER PATIENTS 
WITHIN THE HOSPITAL THERE ARE 
OCCASIONS WHEN WE HAVE TO MIX THE 
SEXES WHICH WOULD NEVER BE WHAT WE 
WOULD CHOOSE TO DO BUT THAT'S 
STILL A BETTER OPTION THAN SOMEBODY 
WITH CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE BEING 
NURSED SOMEWHERE ELSE 
NURSING PROCEDURES ON THE C. DIFF 
WARD THESE DAYS SEEM TO BE AS TIGHT 
AS THE GLOVES AND ALL YOUR 
VISITORS HAVE TO DO THIS DO THEY 
YES 
I'M SURE THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT YES MORE PROFICIENT THAN THIS BUT I 
WANTED TO FIND OUT WILL THE 
EXPERIENCE IS ALSO IMPROVED FOR 
PATIENTS I HEADED FOR ONE C. DIFF 
PATIENT BEING VISITED BY HER 
HUSBAND HELLO PLEASE TO MEET YOU 
I'M DEAF ON THAT SIDE L. HAVE 
HEARING AID 
I WILL SHOUT THEN 
I WENT DOWNSTAIRS FOR A DRINK AND I 
FELL DOWN COMING BACK UP 
WHICH IS 
WHAT BROUGHT YOU INTO HOSPITAL AND 
THEN YOU CAUGHT C. DIFF DID YOU 
YES 
I CAME IN TO VISIT HER ONE YES AFTERNOON AND THEY HAD THE CURTAINS 
AROUND AND SAID I COULDN'T SEE HER 
DID YOU YOU HAVE ANY WORRIES COMING 
INTO THE HOSPITAL SOME PEOPLE SAY 
THEY ARE WORRIED WHEN THEY COME IN 
IN CASE THEY CATCH SOMETHING THE THE LAST THING SHE SAID TO THE DOCTOR 
WHEN HE CAME TO THE DOOR WAS YOU 
ARE NOT TAKING ME TO HOSPITAL ARE 
YOU 
I THINK EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME YOU FEAR BUT I'M IN HERE I COULDN'T 
HAVE BEEN BETTER TREATED 
THEY SAID I WILL BE GOING HOME SOON 
I SHED TWO TEARS BECAUSE I'LL BE 
LEAVING THE NURSES 
WHAT'S THE NATIONAL PICTURE WHEN IT 
COMES TO ISOLATING INFECTED 
PATIENTS WE ASKED WHAT'S THE RATIO 
OF ISOLATION BEDS TO TOTAL BEDS IN 
YOUR TRUST THE ANSWER IS 
COMPLICATED PICTURE BUT OUR SURVEY 
SUGGESTS ONLY EIGHTEEN PER CENT OF BEDS IN THE 
HOSPITALS WE HEARD FROM CAN BE USED 
TO ISOLATE INFECTED PATIENTS 
C. DIFF INFECTION IN A PARENT IN 
PATIENT SH UNISOLATED QUICKLY 
PREFERABLY IN SINGLE BEDROOMS WITH 
EN SUITE FACILITIES BUT THERE 
ISN'T ENOUGH CAPACITIES IN MANY 
HOSPITALS FOR THAT 
THE DIFFICULTY 
FOR HOSPITALS IS THAT ICE LAIPG 
PATIENTS IS COSTLY 
ON AVERAGE 
IT'S TWO HUNDRED A DAY FOR A NORMAL BED IN 
AN OPEN WARD AND TWO THOUSAND A DAY FOR A 
REAL ISOLATION UNIT 
ENGLAND'S FIRST LARGE ACUTE N. H. S. 
HOSPITAL WITH SINGLE ROOMS FOR 
EVERYONE WILL OPEN AT PENBRUY IN 
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THIS PFI FUNDED HOSPITAL WILL 
REPLACE THE OLD PENBURY AND THE 
KENT AND SUSSEX IT WILL HAVE FIVE HUNDRED TWELVE 
SINGLE EN SUITE BEDROOMS 
ANOTHER KEY WEAPON AGAINST HOSPITAL 
INFECTION IS HAND HYGIENE 
MAIDSTONE NOW HAS ALCOHOL GELS AT 
THE ENTRANCE TO EVERY WARD AND THE 
HOSPITAL ITSELF BUT NOT EVERYONE 
USES THEM SORRY TO BOTHER YOU 
WE'RE FROM THE B. B. C. AND WONDERING IF 
YOU'RE STAFF WHY YOU DIDN'T WASH 
YOUR HANDS WHEN YOU DIDN'T COME IN 
WHY BECAUSE WE DO IT BEFORE WE GO 
TO THE WARDS 
WE TEND TO DO IT 
EVERY TIME BEFORE WE SEE A PATIENT 
SO I THINK THAT'S MORE THE 
PRINCIPLE 
PATIENTS IN HOSPITAL ARE PRINCIPLE PART OF THE SOLUTION AS WELL THEY 
HAVE TO BE AWARE THAT WHEN A MEMBER 
OF THE MEDICAL STRAFE IS COMING TO 
EXAMINE THEM TO CHECK ASK THEM 
HAVE YOU WASHED YOUR HANDS BEFORE 
YOU'RE GOING TO TOUCH ME 
WE ASKED WHAT'S PROVIDED OUTSIDE 
YOUR INFECTION WARDS FOR HAND 
STERLINGISATION 
THE GOOD NEWS IS A NINETY SIX PER CENT PROVIDED 
ALCOHOL HAND GELS OUTSIDE THEIR 
INFECTION WARDS THE BAD NEWS IS 
THAT ALCOHOL GELS DON'T WORK 
AGAINST C. DIFF 
NOT MANY THINGS DO WORK AGAINST C. 
DIFF AT THE MOMENT A GOOD SOLUTION 
IS WASHING HANDS WITH SOAP AND 
WATER BUT OTHER SOLUTIONS LIKE 
USING ALCOHOL WIPES DOESN'T WORK 
FOR CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE IN A 
LAND ORDER THE SUPPORTS WE 
ALCOHOL SHOCK THEM SO THE USE OF 
ALCOHOL WIPES IN HOSPITALS SHOULD 
PROBABLY BE STOPPED FOR CLOSTRIDIUM 
DIFFICILE 
IN MAIDSTONE THERE'S DIFFICILE ALCOHOL GEL ON THE WAY INTO THESE 
WARDS BUT BEFORE LEAVING YOU HAVE 
TO WASHING YOUR BE HANDS WITH SOAP 
AND WATER 
BUT HAND WASHING ALONE IS NOT 
ENOUGH IN HIS SEALED PATHOGEN 
CHAMBER IN BRADFORD PROFESSOR 
BEGGS DEMONSTRATES WHAT HOSPITALS 
ARE REALLY UP AGAINST 
ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T DON'T 
REALISE IS WHAT IS CALLS THE AERIAL 
DISEMINATION OF C. DIFF SPORES 
USING AL COME POWDER TODAY AS A 
STAND IN HIS LASER BEAM HIGHLIGHTS 
THE SPORES AS THEY DANCE AROUND THE 
ROOM IMAGINE SOMEONE MAKING A BED 
WHEN THEY TAKE THE SHEETS OFF IF 
THERE ARE ANY SPORES OR FAECAL 
MATTER CONTAM NANTES THEY'LL BE 
READILY AEROSOLISED AND PUT IN THE 
AIR SOME WILL BE TAKEN BY THE 
VENTILATION BUT MANY WILL FALL OUT 
LIKE DUST PARTICLES ON TO SURFACES 
AND THAT'S FROM A LITTLE SHAKE YES YES YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THAT HAPPENING 
HERE 
BUT HOSPITAL STAFF DON'T HAVE HERE LASERS WHAT THEY PATENTLY DO NEED 
IS BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THIS 
LETHAL BACTERIUM BHAIVS 
WE'VE GOT 
TO KEEP LOOKING FOR NEW WAYS OF 
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING 
ON I WOULD SAY THAT THE KEY THING 
TO DO IS UNDERSTANDING HOW THE 
INFECTIONS ARE TRANSMITTED AROUND 
THE WARDS IF WE UNDERSTAND THAT 
FULLY THEN I BELIEVE WE CAN 
DEVELOP EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS 
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAS COME 
UP WITH DIFFERENT WAY OF 
ADDRESSING THE THREAT AROUND THE 
TIME A POSSIBLE ELECTION WAS ON THE 
CARDS EVERY HOSPITAL IN ENGLAND 
WAS ORDERED TO GET THE INDUSTRIAL 
CLEANERS IN 
TO IMPROVE CLEANLINESS 
AND ENSURE PATIENTS HAVE CONFIDENCE 
THAT THEIR HOSPITALS ARE SAFE WE 
HAVE ANNOUNCED A DEEP CLEAN OF ALL 
HOSPITALS SUPPORTED BY STRATEGIC 
HEALTH AUTHORITY FUNDING OF FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT 
MILLION EVERY TRUST HAS ASSURED ME 
THEY'LL HAVE COMPLETED THEIR DEEP 
CLEAN BY THE END OF MARCH 
IN COMMON WITH MANY OTHER HOSPITALS 
MAIDSTONE WAS STILL BUSY CLEANING 
THIS MONTH 
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THIS WARD HAD ONE OF THE 
HOSPITAL'S HIGHEST NUMBER OF C. DIFF 
CASES NOW IT'S BEEN BLASTED BY 
HIGH PRESSURE STEAM AT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES 
CENTIGRADE THE COME MODES ARE 
WASHED IN TANKS WHERE THE DIRT IS 
REMOVED BY ULTRASONIC WAVES 
EVERYTHING'S CLEAN ALL RIGHT BUT 
FOR HOW LONG 
SOMEBODY COMES IN AND 
COUGHS AND YOU'VE CONTAMINATED YOUR 
WARD AGAIN BUT IT'S A DEEP CLEAN 
GETTING INTO THE NOOKS AND CRANNIES 
GETTING RID OF THE RESIDUAL DIRT 
WHICH IN A NORMAL CLEAN YOU 
WOULDN'T DISLODGE 
THE PROBLEM WITH DEEP CLEAN IS THAT 
POTENTIALLY IF YOU STRESS THE 
BACTERIUM PARTICULARLY CLOSTRIDIA 
IT FORMS SPORES AND IT'S THEN IN A 
MORE SURVIVE STATE WHEN YOU STRESS 
BAR TEARIA THEY BECOME MORE 
MUTEABLE SO THE RATE OF MUTATION 
WILL INCREASE RATHER THAN MAKING 
MATTERS BETTER THEY COULD MAKE 
MATTERS WORSE 
EVERY TRUST HAVE 
ASSURED ME THEY'LL HAVE COMPLETED 
THEIR DEEP CLEAN BY THE END OF 
MARCH 
OUR SURVEY ASKED WHAT MARCH PERCENTAGE MUCH YOUR WARDS WILL 
HAVE BEEN DEEP CLEANED BY THE END 
OF MARCH SEVENTY FIRST PER CENT SAID THEY HAD 
COMPLETED IT BUT ALMOST A THIRD 
TWENTY NINE PER CENT SAID THEY HADN'T 
BUT ARE THESE MEASURES REALLY 
ENOUGH TO BEAT A SUPERBUG THAT'S 
ADAPTING ALL THE TIME WHAT 
SCIENTISTS WANT IS FUNDING FOR THE 
RESEARCH THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO 
UNDERSTAND IT 
THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T PUT MUCH 
FUNDING INTO BASIC RESEARCH OF 
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE AND OTHER 
SUPERBUGS THE GOVERNMENT HAS PUT 
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION INTO NEW INITIATIVE 
WITHIN HOSPITALS AND FIFTY MILLION 
TOWARDS DEEP CLEANING BUT IF 
TRACTION OF THAT COULD BE PUT INTO 
RESEARCH THEN WE COULD POTENTIALLY 
HAVE A BETTER LONG TERM SOLUTION 
FOR ERADICATING CLOSTRIDIUM 
DIFFICILE 
ANOTHER CONCERN IS ABOUT DIFFICILE HOW WE DEFEAT C. DIFFICILE AND HOW 
FEW AND HOW BATTERED OUR WEAPONS 
ARE ARE ONLY TWO ANTIBIOTICS VANCOMYCIN 
AND METRONIDAZOLE CAN TREAT 
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE ALREADY ONE 
OF THEM IS LOOKING VULNERABLE 
AT THE LEEDS TEACHING HOSPITALS' 
TRUST PROFESSOR MARK WILCOX TRACKS 
CLUSTERS OF INFECTIONS FOR 
FINGERPRINTING HIS LATEST 
RESEARCH HAS REVEALED PARTIAL 
RESISTANCE TO METRONIDAZOLE IF IF THAT CONTINUES WE'RE LIKELY THEN 
TO END UP WITH A SINGLE ANTIBIOTIC 
CHOICE FOR FOR TREATING C. DIFF 
INFECTION VANCOMYCIN HAS BEEN 
AVAILABLE SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND NINETEEN SIXTIES 
AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN RESISTANCE 
DEVELOPING THERE YET IT ISN'T A 
GOOD SCENARIO WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY 
CASES AND A SINGLE ANTIBIOTIC 
IDEALLY WHAT WE'D LIKE IS A NON 
ANTIBIOTIC WAY OF TREATING A C. DIFF 
INFECTION PERHAPS BY USING A 
VACCINE TO PREVENT CASES OR BY 
USING ANTIBODIES TO KILL THE BUG 
BUT THAT'S A WAY IN THE FUTURE 
RIGHT NOW THIS IS A PRETTY 
WORRYING SITUATION 
IT TYPICALLY 
TAKES TEN YEARS FROM TEST TUBE TO 
GETTING A DRUG TO MARKET 
LAST MONTH THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT 
ANNOUNCED ONE POINT TWO FIVE MILLION 
INVESTMENT IN STATE OF THE ART 
TESTING WOMEN SO THAT HEALTH BOARDS 
COULD MONITOR THE RESISTANCE OF 
SUPERBUGS TO ANTIBIOTICS BUT 
CRUCIAL TO WINNING THE LONG TERM 
BATTLE AGAINST C. DIFFICILE IS 
RESEARCH WHICH MANY SCIENTISTS 
BELIEVE IS LAMENTABLY INADEQUATE 
A. N. N. KEEN ARGUES THAT THE DEPARTMENT 
OF HEALTH IS ALREADY PUTTING IN 
ENOUGH MONEY 
TWO POINT FIVE MILLION FROM 
NICE SIXTEEN MILLION WITH THE MEDICAL 
RESEARCH COUNCIL SO THERE IS A LOT 
OF ACTIVE RESEARCH BUT AT THE SAME 
TIME WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS ACT ON 
THE RESEARCH THAT WE ALREADY KNOW 
ABOUT AND I THINK IT'S VERY 
IMPORTANT THAT THE HEALTH HEALTH 
SERVICE PUTS THAT INTO PRACTICE 
SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS 
THAT'S NOT VERY MUCH COMPARED TO 
THE SCALE OF THIS PROBLEM AND THE 
COST OF HOSPITAL INFECTIONS TO THE 
N. H. S. 
SIXTEEN POINT FIVE IS ONE I SAID IT WAS N. H. S. ALREADY THE NICE INITIATIVE BUT 
THERE IS IS ALREADY MUCH RESEARCH 
THAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT BUT BUT SCIENTISTS AT THE COAL FACE FEEL 
THAT NOT ENOUGH IS GOING IN SO THAT 
THE BACTERIUM CAN BE UNDERSTOOD 
AND ONCE IT'S UNDERSTOOD BETTER 
THEN IT CAN BE DEFEATED 
WELL IT'S 
OUR DUTY OF COURSE TO TAKE NOTE 
OF THAT AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT 
THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING 
WHATEVER IS MEANT BY TAKING NOTE 
THE WAR AGAINST C. DIFFICILE WILL BE 
A LENGTHY ONE AND UNLESS HOSPITALS 
ARE GEARED UP TO FIGHT ON EVERY 
FRONT THE SUPERBUG WILL WIN AS 
THE MAIDSTONE TRUST KNOWS ONLY TOO 
WELL THEIR BATTLE SCARS HAVE 
PROVIDED HARD EARNED LESSON FOR 
OTHER HOSPITALS 
THE CHROME OF 
INFECTION IN HOSPITAL IS EVERY BIT 
AS IMPORTANT AS OTHER PRIORITIES IN 
THE N. H. S. AND THAT MESSAGE IS WHAT 
TRUST BOARDS NEED TO HEAR THEY 
NEED TO RAISE THEIR EYES ABOVE THE 
BALANCE SHEETS AND THE ACHIEVEMENT 
OF TARGETS FOR WAITING TIMES AND 
THINK ABOUT THE HORROR OF PATIENTS 
COMING IN WHO ARE INFECTION FREE 
AND PICKET UP A POTENTIALLY DEADLY 
INFECTION ON THEIR WARDS 
BECAUSE NOBODY SHOULD BE AFRAID TO 
GO INTO HOSPITAL FOR FEAR OF 
CATCHING SOMETHING WORSE SHOULD 
THEY 
NO OF COURSE THEY SHOULDN'T THEY BE BE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES ACROSS THE U. K. 
ARE GRIEVING TODAY FOR RELATIVES 
WHO FOUND THAT DEADLY SUPERBUG 
WAITING FOR THEM IN HOSPITAL 
WHAT MAIDSTONE'S TRAGEDY SHOWS IS 
THAT WHILE PEOPLE PAY A TERRIBLE 
PRICE WHEN HOSPITALS GET IT WRONG 
GETTING SOME THINGS RIGHT CAN 
REDUCE THE HUMAN COST 
I'M VERY CONSCIOUS THAT THIS HAS 
BEEN A HUMAN TRAGEDY FOR A LOT OF 
PEOPLE PEOPLE I DO THINK THAT LESSONS HAVE BEEN 
LEARNED I THINK LESSONS HAVE VERY 
DEFINITELY BEEN LEARNED IN THIS 
ORGANISATION AND MORE WIDELY IN 
THE HEALTH SERVICE L. DO ACTUALLY 
THINK THAT GENUINELY THAT THIS MAKE 
A LONG TERM DIFFERENCE TO THE WAY 
IN WHICH WE CONTROL INFECTION AND 
MANAGE THIS DISEASE IN PARTICULAR 
IN FUTURE 
AT MAIDSTONE THESE DAYS IT'S KNOWN 
FOR C. DIFF PATIENTS TO CRY ON THEIR 
WAY OUT RATHER THAN THE OTHER WAY 
ROUND ROUND ALTHOUGH THERE'S STILL SOME WAY TO 
GO IN TURNING ITS HOSPITALS ROUND 
THE TRUST HAS SEEN A FALL OF THIRTY FIVE PER CENT IN 
C. DIFF INFECTION RATES OVER THE 
LAST YEAR 
BUT CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE IS WILY 
FOE IF WE'RE EVER TO BEAT IT ALL 
BRITAIN'S HOSPITALS WILL NEED TO 
RAISE THEIR GAME 
ONLY YO OU 
CAN MAKE THIS WORLD SEEM BRIGHT 
WE GOT COMPANY 
ONLY YOU 
SOME THINGS GET BETTER WITH AGE 
THE INDIANA JONES TRILOGY BEGINS
